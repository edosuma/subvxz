00:27.793 --> 00:28.960
<i>Life.</i>

00:30.296 --> 00:33.131
<i>In this humdrum sense, is worth</i>

00:33.499 --> 00:34.667
<i>avoiding.</i>

00:37.368 --> 00:41.470
<i>It's the factory for the father
and the kitchen for mother.</i>

00:41.472 --> 00:44.374
<i>It's arguments at the dinner table,</i>

00:44.376 --> 00:46.643
<i>missing children on the news.</i>

00:46.645 --> 00:52.185
<i>And through it all, a sense that
things are slowly falling apart.</i>

00:56.922 --> 01:00.656
<i>Is it better to choose another
record and flip the lid on the pills,</i>

01:00.658 --> 01:03.595
<i>and wait for something to happen?</i>

01:05.396 --> 01:07.331
<i>Is it better to turn out the lights</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:08.932
<i>climb under the covers</i>

01:08.934 --> 01:13.172
<i>until sleep invites you to a
world you've always wanted.</i>

01:15.708 --> 01:18.577
<i>Is it better than the one
that's in front of us?</i>

01:41.432 --> 01:43.502
Stop being a mad ass.

01:50.175 --> 01:51.777
Two beers, please.

01:54.146 --> 01:56.078
If you spent as much
time looking for a band

01:56.080 --> 01:58.784
as you do slagging them off,
it could be you up there.

02:03.087 --> 02:04.957
There's a reason...

02:07.359 --> 02:10.229
Oh, come on, Steven, I was
only pulling your pisser.

02:17.068 --> 02:19.435
Should we go to town on Saturday night?

02:19.437 --> 02:21.137
We could go to that new club.

02:21.139 --> 02:22.672
Not been yet.

02:22.674 --> 02:24.840
Yeah but we'll just sit
there, like it's a funeral.

02:24.842 --> 02:27.879
Yeah, we could pretend it's
yours, you'll like that.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.384
I just think that there's
more to life than being...

02:34.386 --> 02:35.685
Right, keep walking.

02:35.687 --> 02:36.553
Pardon?

02:36.555 --> 02:38.755
Keep walking, or you'll get taunted.

02:38.757 --> 02:41.694
Just try and act normal for ten seconds.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.464
You're dickheads.

03:01.913 --> 03:03.582
Have you found a job yet?

03:04.583 --> 03:05.981
No.

03:05.983 --> 03:08.653
Well, you're not going to find
one sitting around on your arse.

03:13.991 --> 03:15.458
There's nothing suitable.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.027
What does that mean?

03:17.029 --> 03:18.630
Something suitable.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.797
Leave him alone.

03:20.799 --> 03:22.398
He's gonna have to find a job some day.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.899
He wants to write.

03:23.901 --> 03:26.004
Write? He can't even write his bloody name.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.178
Why do you always do that?

03:37.049 --> 03:38.317
You are right.

03:41.753 --> 03:43.922
I can't find Roxy.

03:44.288 --> 03:45.321
No, I meant...

03:45.323 --> 03:46.958
They've been like that for years, Angie.

03:47.726 --> 03:49.061
Is it serious?

03:51.329 --> 03:52.865
Do you want to talk about it?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.671
There's no use bottling things up.

04:02.039 --> 04:03.039
Life is too short.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.343
For cliches.

04:08.312 --> 04:09.782
Forget it.

04:27.965 --> 04:30.001
You ever think it could have been awesome.

04:31.402 --> 04:33.238
Buried in the dirt.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.420
<i>Dear enemy,</i>

04:49.087 --> 04:51.121
<i>Manchester is a lovely place.</i>

04:51.123 --> 04:54.726
<i>If you happen to be a
bed-ridden deaf mute.</i>

04:55.693 --> 05:00.030
<i>The local music scene is the
sole preserve of troglodytes</i>

05:00.032 --> 05:03.165
<i>whose regard for
subtlety and variation</i>

05:03.167 --> 05:07.105
<i>is comparable to a pig's
passion for the slaughterhouse.</i>

05:07.840 --> 05:10.340
<i>The performance was
the musical equivalent</i>

05:10.342 --> 05:12.275
<i>of a prolonged bowel movement</i>

05:12.277 --> 05:16.849
<i>followed by an unexpected
absence of toilet paper.</i>

05:17.782 --> 05:20.516
<i>In case I haven't made myself clear,</i>

05:20.518 --> 05:22.287
<i>it wasn't very good.</i>

06:05.263 --> 06:06.866
What about this?

06:08.032 --> 06:09.766
I don't think so.

06:09.768 --> 06:12.003
No it's a good job if you're not fussy.

06:13.571 --> 06:15.170
Here's one.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.439
Girl group seeks moaning minnie.

06:17.441 --> 06:18.975
Now you could do that.

06:18.977 --> 06:20.175
Not funny.

06:20.177 --> 06:22.112
I don't know what I'm meant
to be looking for, do I?

06:22.114 --> 06:24.950
There's no point in dragging me here
every week, just to play the cunt.

06:39.263 --> 06:41.499
Holly-fucking-luya.

06:43.902 --> 06:45.171
Yeah.

06:45.403 --> 06:46.938
Yeah, all right.

06:48.172 --> 06:50.040
Yeah, we will meet you tomorrow.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.243
Great. Okay. Bye.

06:55.112 --> 06:56.282
Got you a date.

07:52.203 --> 07:53.972
Hey, he's quite fit.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.773
Do you think that's him?

07:56.775 --> 08:00.378
Leather jacket, check, red hair, check.

08:01.546 --> 08:03.580
I don't like his shoes.

08:03.582 --> 08:06.282
Just look him in the
eye and don't cock it up.

08:06.284 --> 08:07.182
Just give me a minute.

08:07.184 --> 08:09.320
You're not meeting the fucking Pope.

08:09.955 --> 08:11.957
Should we get out there or what?

08:12.790 --> 08:13.622
We?

08:13.624 --> 08:14.857
I could be your agent.

08:14.859 --> 08:16.559
- Oh my goodness.
- Shall I count to ten?

08:16.561 --> 08:19.261
Ten, nine, eight,

08:19.263 --> 08:21.599
- seven, six, five...
- Fine!

08:43.788 --> 08:45.457
Are you gonna sulk all day?

08:46.023 --> 08:46.756
I'm not sulking.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.294
What are you doing then?

08:50.262 --> 08:51.261
I'm sulking.

08:51.263 --> 08:53.128
You're the one who wouldn't talk to him.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.433
The world is not just gonna come to you.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.666
It might do.

08:57.668 --> 08:59.170
You're ridiculous.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.674
You may as well get a job in ASDA.

09:03.307 --> 09:04.240
What, like you?

09:04.242 --> 09:05.644
Oh, fuck off!

09:06.177 --> 09:07.711
Mommy's boy.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.649
You know, some of us live in the real
world with proper shit to deal with.

09:19.657 --> 09:21.025
I don't need this.

09:23.762 --> 09:25.630
Call me when you've grown a pair.

09:50.522 --> 09:52.091
Look after your mother.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.269
Merry Christmas, hey.

10:06.671 --> 10:08.506
Who's gonna carve your turkey?

10:12.076 --> 10:13.277
Dickhead.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.425
Are you a DJ?

12:09.628 --> 12:11.330
What's with the record, then?

12:13.831 --> 12:16.635
Hey, Lerch, she's talking to you.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.541
What have you done now?

14:04.542 --> 14:06.712
Have you got any plans for lunch, Steven?

14:07.445 --> 14:08.745
Um, yes.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.112
Cancel them.

14:10.114 --> 14:11.783
You're gonna clean up this mess.

14:12.149 --> 14:13.684
Get your shit together.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.252
Nice one, knob jockey.

14:17.254 --> 14:18.924
Get back to work, you two.

14:40.677 --> 14:43.781
<i>If there was ever a
revolution in England,</i>

14:45.082 --> 14:47.150
<i>we'd form an orderly queue</i>

14:47.152 --> 14:48.919
<i>at the guillotine.</i>

14:55.493 --> 14:59.664
<i>Nothing worth doing in
life involves repetition.</i>

15:03.234 --> 15:06.038
<i>It's the mind that matters.</i>

15:18.082 --> 15:21.317
<i>The mind allows us to think</i>

15:21.319 --> 15:23.021
<i>and feel</i>

15:26.124 --> 15:28.959
<i>and see the beauty of things</i>

15:29.793 --> 15:36.000
<i>where others can only see
crank bearings and spark plugs.</i>

15:46.911 --> 15:48.580
My little brother,

15:49.013 --> 15:50.782
climbing that career ladder.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.117
Please.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.125
Chief pencil sharpener.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.028
I'm not even listening.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.010
Just a beer.

17:30.648 --> 17:31.816
Ta.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.848
I owe you an apology.

18:06.484 --> 18:08.084
What for?

18:08.086 --> 18:11.857
Steven Morrissey from Stratford certainly
likes the sound of his own voice.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.859
Someone needed to say it.

18:18.128 --> 18:19.663
Thank you.

18:20.497 --> 18:22.397
You need to use more semicolons.

18:22.399 --> 18:24.066
You write really well

18:24.068 --> 18:27.302
but you shouldn't be afraid
to use more semicolons.

18:27.304 --> 18:30.039
You know, relax the diction,
you're not Jane Austen.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.610
Linder, we're going.

18:31.775 --> 18:33.209
Come to our party.

18:33.211 --> 18:35.978
Come on, we can slag off the bands we hate.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.413
This is Steven.

18:37.415 --> 18:39.281
He's a published writer.

18:39.283 --> 18:41.983
Ah. Fellow Straton. Pleased to meet you.

18:41.985 --> 18:43.654
I'm gonna collect my coat.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.090
Be nice.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.059
So you write then, do you?

18:48.559 --> 18:49.727
Um...

18:50.661 --> 18:52.595
They're just letters, I'm
not really published...

18:52.597 --> 18:54.262
- Ah, a man of letters.
- Or a lettered man.

18:54.264 --> 18:58.099
A lettered man would imply a man
with a PhD or similar, would it not?

18:58.101 --> 18:59.501
Not necessarily.

18:59.503 --> 19:03.306
A lettered man simply means
an academic in the abstract.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.906
Would you rather be a man of letters,

19:04.908 --> 19:06.177
or a lettered man.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.813
You're confusing him now, Gordon.

19:11.248 --> 19:12.683
Ready?

19:12.984 --> 19:13.915
No.

19:13.917 --> 19:14.849
Come on.

21:16.006 --> 21:17.374
These are really...

21:19.510 --> 21:20.576
They're really...

21:20.578 --> 21:21.876
Are you trying to say you like them?

21:21.878 --> 21:23.047
Yes, yeah.

21:23.313 --> 21:25.047
Well...

21:25.049 --> 21:28.019
It will all be for nothing
if I don't get it finished.

21:50.407 --> 21:53.341
I love the silent hour of night,

21:53.343 --> 21:55.380
for blissful dreams may then arise

22:01.519 --> 22:03.053
Do you have to be somewhere?

22:05.356 --> 22:06.890
Gonna be late for work.

22:07.190 --> 22:08.459
Which is where?

22:09.560 --> 22:11.161
The Inland Revenue.

22:11.896 --> 22:14.165
Is it true they all have webbed feet?

22:15.899 --> 22:17.732
You do know there is more to life

22:17.734 --> 22:19.403
than dark satanic mills.

22:27.744 --> 22:29.413
There was a rambling garden.

22:31.014 --> 22:32.484
Gravestones,

22:33.451 --> 22:35.084
elderberries.

22:35.086 --> 22:39.190
Alfred sat in the pagoda, looking
longingly at his winklepickers.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.329
Sounds like

22:45.128 --> 22:46.363
Dickens.

22:47.831 --> 22:49.033
Dickens?

22:49.266 --> 22:50.501
Just me.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.510
Steven Patrick Morrissey.

23:01.579 --> 23:04.646
A man who decided to dedicate his life

23:04.648 --> 23:07.051
to working for the tax man.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.454
Where he stamped documents,

23:11.621 --> 23:13.357
and licked envelopes,

23:14.425 --> 23:16.024
beautifully.

23:16.026 --> 23:17.225
Oh, so beautifully.

23:17.227 --> 23:21.064
Seriously, you can't be
happy working in that place.

23:23.033 --> 23:26.004
Oh, I am as merry as the days were long.

23:26.303 --> 23:27.938
You can't beat me.

23:28.472 --> 23:30.539
Shakespeare.

23:30.541 --> 23:33.178
You can't beat me, don't even try it.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.380
Just be yourself.

23:36.013 --> 23:38.015
Everyone else is taken.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.151
Oscar Wilde.

23:42.153 --> 23:43.488
Shit...

24:01.071 --> 24:02.570
Oi.

24:02.572 --> 24:04.106
She's hot, ain't she?

24:04.108 --> 24:05.307
Oh, no.

24:05.309 --> 24:07.846
I use her shit for toothpaste.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.214
Let me take you in, and show you everybody.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.182
Haha!

24:12.416 --> 24:14.482
The wanderer returns.

24:14.484 --> 24:16.053
How many days has it been?

24:17.321 --> 24:18.486
It is six.

24:18.488 --> 24:19.821
We'll discuss it later.

24:19.823 --> 24:23.258
Now I would like to introduce
you all to Christine.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.961
Christine is going to be
shadowing young Steven.

24:25.963 --> 24:28.230
And keeping an eye on him, I expect.

24:28.232 --> 24:31.200
So Steven, if you would like
to give Christine the tour,

24:31.202 --> 24:33.271
show her how things are done around here.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.977
Is that okay, Steven?

24:45.549 --> 24:47.252
You don't say much, do you?

24:50.286 --> 24:52.890
If you want me to help with
anything, just let me know.

24:53.456 --> 24:55.159
Do you have any bullets?

24:55.292 --> 24:56.526
What?

24:58.963 --> 25:01.499
So do you have much auditioning experience?

25:03.533 --> 25:05.436
I keep a list of people I dislike.

25:09.473 --> 25:10.675
Terry seems nice.

25:12.176 --> 25:15.309
- Terry?
- Mr. Leonard.

25:15.311 --> 25:18.146
Well, if you like men who have a
penchant for arcane numerical systems...

25:18.148 --> 25:20.618
- Do you always talk like that?
- What?

25:21.385 --> 25:22.684
Like what?

25:22.686 --> 25:25.119
By using big words.

25:25.121 --> 25:30.995
Your voice is sort of funny. You're
not, like, posh. Are you from Bolton?

25:45.909 --> 25:47.210
Hello.

25:47.645 --> 25:49.179
May I see Steven?

25:49.980 --> 25:51.713
Who is it?

25:51.715 --> 25:54.118
There is a girl at the door to see Dierdre.

25:55.852 --> 25:58.486
Eh, was he expecting you?

25:58.488 --> 26:01.857
Linder. No, he's not expecting me.

26:01.859 --> 26:03.695
Might as well go on up, love.

26:06.763 --> 26:09.231
You'll have to bang on the door.

26:28.551 --> 26:30.153
Hold on.

26:35.391 --> 26:37.260
What are you doing here?

26:38.228 --> 26:39.596
Was that you?

26:41.365 --> 26:43.067
Mmm, no...

26:47.103 --> 26:49.573
I thought you said we were meeting in town.

26:50.707 --> 26:51.639
Christ.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.276
It's like a museum in here.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.547
You're gonna put the kettle on then?

26:58.549 --> 27:00.148
We don't wanna be late though.

27:00.150 --> 27:02.386
Nobody watches the support bands.

27:03.286 --> 27:04.554
I do.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.824
Milk and two sugar, Steven.

27:08.826 --> 27:10.459
Just, just, just...

27:10.461 --> 27:11.629
Please don't touch anything.

27:12.463 --> 27:13.765
I won't.

28:07.584 --> 28:08.751
Right.

28:14.491 --> 28:17.294
Do you think you can
hand some of these out?

28:18.428 --> 28:20.797
I don't think that's your target audience.

28:21.732 --> 28:23.367
I told you.

28:23.667 --> 28:25.303
Think big, Shakespeare.

28:28.038 --> 28:30.207
Think you've got an admirer.

28:32.475 --> 28:33.774
Oh, God.

28:33.776 --> 28:35.378
You know him?

28:36.347 --> 28:37.646
I think he plays guitar.

28:37.648 --> 28:38.946
He certainly knows you.

28:38.948 --> 28:40.817
Just stop staring at him.

28:41.351 --> 28:43.487
Excuse me, mate. Have we met before?

28:46.090 --> 28:48.325
You're not in a band or anything?

28:49.158 --> 28:50.759
No, he's not yet. You?

28:50.761 --> 28:52.728
Well, trying to get something together.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.732
- I'm Billy,
- Linder.

28:55.131 --> 28:56.833
This is mute here is Steven.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.803
Got a light?

29:02.473 --> 29:04.275
This is my mate, Johnny.

29:04.707 --> 29:06.074
Are you in his band?

29:06.076 --> 29:08.412
Nah, I can't sing.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.216
Well, here we go.

29:15.218 --> 29:17.554
- Maybe see you in there.
- Maybe.

29:25.628 --> 29:26.962
What?

29:26.964 --> 29:28.900
Steven, what are you waiting for?

29:30.067 --> 29:32.099
Just do something, take a chance.

29:32.101 --> 29:34.502
Even cavemen wrote their name on a wall.

29:34.504 --> 29:36.738
How's the world going
to remember you? Write.

29:36.740 --> 29:40.711
Sing. Just don't moan about it when
it's someone else's name they remember.

30:56.853 --> 30:58.787
I love that record.

30:58.789 --> 31:00.658
He writes some great lyrics, Strummer.

31:03.961 --> 31:05.961
What do you like about them?

31:05.963 --> 31:09.033
Strummer's lyrics, I'm interested to know.

31:10.501 --> 31:14.405
Don't you find him rather schematic
in his self-flagellating world view?

31:17.140 --> 31:19.276
<i>White Riot's</i> good song.

31:30.721 --> 31:32.323
When you're ready, mate.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.108
I'll make us a bread.

32:25.742 --> 32:27.908
Stick the Clash on if you want.

32:27.910 --> 32:30.113
It's not all of whatever you said.

33:14.057 --> 33:16.160
My mom loves this sort of stuff.

33:19.963 --> 33:21.532
Mine too.

34:07.276 --> 34:08.678
You're late.

34:11.581 --> 34:12.782
Again.

34:14.384 --> 34:15.886
Anything you'd like to say?

34:16.752 --> 34:18.087
Not really. No.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.223
I don't know what you think you're doing,

34:21.225 --> 34:23.157
but you're coasting.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.125
You can't waltz in here
any time that suits,

34:25.127 --> 34:26.061
pick up your pay check

34:26.063 --> 34:27.929
and fuck off at 5:00!

34:27.931 --> 34:29.233
It's not the way it works.

34:38.007 --> 34:39.876
Why can't you be more like everyone else?

34:42.946 --> 34:44.445
Right.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.715
I want those files shifted.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.753
And don't make me repeat any of this again.

34:51.587 --> 34:52.654
Which files?

34:52.656 --> 34:53.822
What?

35:42.471 --> 35:44.072
You're not going to jump, are you?

35:44.074 --> 35:45.639
- No, no...
- What's this?

35:45.641 --> 35:48.012
- It's nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothing.

35:48.878 --> 35:52.012
I'm sick of being an undiscovered genius.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.016
Please just give it back.

35:55.018 --> 35:56.317
What are these, poems?

35:56.319 --> 35:57.585
No, they're not.

35:57.587 --> 36:00.487
It is becoming more
apparent now as I get older

36:00.489 --> 36:04.224
that everyone is an imbecile except me.

36:04.226 --> 36:06.162
Oh, my God.

36:06.228 --> 36:07.295
Christine...

36:07.297 --> 36:09.066
Wait till I tell everyone.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.135
Christine.

36:17.406 --> 36:18.875
Under one condition.

36:26.782 --> 36:28.151
What, can this wait?

36:28.784 --> 36:30.050
You promised.

36:30.052 --> 36:31.920
Yes, but...

36:31.922 --> 36:35.623
I have absolutely nothing
to do with this creature.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.257
Do you promise not to
think any worse of me?

36:37.259 --> 36:40.363
- Uh, no. Hiya!
- Hiya.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.133
Steven.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.500
Oh, Christine, um...

36:45.502 --> 36:47.201
Linder, this is Christine.

36:47.203 --> 36:51.874
Christine is an esteemed cohort in
the business of petty and dignity.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.942
Tonight, I'll see you as well?

36:53.944 --> 36:55.110
Why not?

36:55.112 --> 36:56.411
Looking out for you...

36:56.413 --> 36:58.115
I wouldn't have him any other way.

36:59.148 --> 37:00.918
What's wrong with her tits?

37:01.284 --> 37:02.784
It's from my exhibition.

37:02.786 --> 37:04.018
It's art, is it?

37:04.020 --> 37:05.119
Yeah.

37:05.121 --> 37:07.621
I'm not sure I understand it.

37:07.623 --> 37:09.690
Well, maybe you could come along.

37:09.692 --> 37:11.625
And Steven could explain it to you.

37:11.627 --> 37:12.761
You know, he writes poetry.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.228
She doesn't understand that either.

37:14.230 --> 37:15.898
Cheeky twat.

37:17.266 --> 37:18.433
I think I'll leave you two to...

37:18.435 --> 37:19.933
No. You don't have to.

37:19.935 --> 37:22.372
Come on, what do you feel like eating?

37:23.272 --> 37:24.605
I don't care.

37:24.607 --> 37:26.242
As long as it's poisonous.

39:35.105 --> 39:37.341
You cunt!

40:28.824 --> 40:30.827
Dear lord, what happened to you?

40:36.498 --> 40:39.068
Think I'm ready for the electric shock.

40:39.402 --> 40:41.238
All right. One minute.

40:55.985 --> 40:57.253
Ready?

41:05.929 --> 41:07.598
What do you think that means?

41:08.931 --> 41:10.633
Whatever you want it to mean.

41:11.534 --> 41:13.400
What does that mean?

41:13.402 --> 41:15.037
What I just said.

41:20.944 --> 41:22.646
Come and have a look at this!

41:23.712 --> 41:26.015
I found a picture of a cock.

41:32.154 --> 41:36.056
As you can see, these
are extraordinary works.

41:36.058 --> 41:41.429
Our students are the future of
Manchester's thrilling artistic scene.

41:41.431 --> 41:43.730
But, as every artist knows,

41:43.732 --> 41:46.634
it's hard to resit the pull of the capitol.

41:46.636 --> 41:48.969
And, we're delighted to announce,

41:48.971 --> 41:52.974
That Linder's exhibition
will travel to London.

41:54.978 --> 41:56.246
Thank you.

42:00.116 --> 42:01.584
I need a drink.

42:02.418 --> 42:03.986
Ooh, are we getting pissed?

42:10.326 --> 42:12.195
I'm really very happy for you.

42:14.163 --> 42:15.331
You deserve it.

42:16.098 --> 42:17.967
You don't look it.

42:19.735 --> 42:21.371
Will you be gone long?

42:22.105 --> 42:24.107
As long as it takes.

42:28.877 --> 42:30.279
Billy!

42:30.346 --> 42:31.679
Steve.

42:31.681 --> 42:34.715
Sorry, mate. Didn't
mean to crash the party.

42:34.717 --> 42:36.851
Your mom said you'd be here, so...

42:36.853 --> 42:39.753
Fuck me, I need to stop smoking.

42:39.755 --> 42:41.389
Billy, why are you here?

42:41.391 --> 42:43.925
What would you say, if I told
you we were joining a band,

42:43.927 --> 42:45.192
and we got ourselves a gig?

42:45.194 --> 42:48.096
I'd say, Billy, get off the drugs.

42:48.098 --> 42:50.600
Then call me Bob fucking Marley.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.900
I know this band, The Nosebleeds,

42:53.902 --> 42:56.070
they suddenly find
themselves shy of a singer,

42:56.072 --> 42:58.739
a guitarist, and some decent tunes.

42:58.741 --> 43:00.574
So I said we'd do it.

43:00.576 --> 43:02.143
It's brilliant.

43:02.145 --> 43:04.680
It's a double celebration,
I'll get us some more drinks.

43:06.850 --> 43:08.382
You don't look too happy about it.

43:08.384 --> 43:11.088
Why is everybody concerned
with my happiness?

43:11.554 --> 43:13.590
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:14.089 --> 43:15.655
Hey!

43:15.657 --> 43:17.494
What are we celebrating?

43:23.433 --> 43:25.299
She's adorable.

43:25.301 --> 43:29.006
In a bovine kind of way.

43:31.241 --> 43:33.410
I've never been to a gallery before.

43:34.043 --> 43:35.746
Did you just see what they were wearing?

43:36.478 --> 43:38.280
If only we could make an effort.

43:39.581 --> 43:42.983
You know, I just can't see
the point of university.

43:42.985 --> 43:45.052
Do you know how much I would love a job?

43:45.054 --> 43:47.691
- You have a job.
- What, that?

43:48.090 --> 43:49.056
No.

43:49.058 --> 43:51.727
No, I'm only giving it another few months.

43:52.261 --> 43:54.494
I want a career change.

43:54.496 --> 43:57.367
You know, our Tracy's gonna
get us a job in fashion.

43:58.067 --> 43:59.602
Do you think I'd be good at that?

44:00.302 --> 44:01.802
I do.

44:01.804 --> 44:04.673
Some of the girls tonight were
dressed like blokes, did you see that?

44:06.409 --> 44:08.608
Your girlfriend dresses well.

44:08.610 --> 44:10.246
She's not my girlfriend.

44:10.313 --> 44:11.581
Piss off.

44:12.915 --> 44:15.317
You're like two peas in a fucking pod.

44:16.386 --> 44:18.219
She's got a great rack
though, I'll give her that.

44:18.221 --> 44:19.389
Oh, God.

44:20.790 --> 44:22.355
It's getting cold, isn't it?

44:22.357 --> 44:23.659
No.

44:26.029 --> 44:28.298
So when's this gig then?

44:29.464 --> 44:31.532
You know we're all gonna
come to that, don't you?

44:31.534 --> 44:32.836
Please don't.

44:33.670 --> 44:34.668
Look, is it much further?

44:34.670 --> 44:35.902
No.

44:35.904 --> 44:37.440
It's just up here.

44:39.741 --> 44:41.474
Well, good night, Christine.

44:41.476 --> 44:44.380
You got to walk me to the front door
otherwise you're not a gentleman.

44:55.625 --> 44:57.193
So...

44:57.860 --> 44:59.559
Do you want to come in then?

44:59.561 --> 45:00.527
I don't think so.

45:00.529 --> 45:01.697
Oh, come on.

45:02.331 --> 45:03.767
Mr. Hard to Get.

47:29.712 --> 47:31.347
Oi, Steve-o!

47:41.023 --> 47:42.925
Right, here we go.

49:27.663 --> 49:29.499
Are you happy?

49:31.634 --> 49:33.136
I think so, yes.

49:35.505 --> 49:36.973
Should I be?

49:38.507 --> 49:40.642
You owned the room, Shakespeare.

49:40.976 --> 49:42.678
You were the room.

49:47.116 --> 49:48.482
What's this?

49:48.484 --> 49:49.919
The big time.

49:50.118 --> 49:51.485
Some London manager,

49:51.487 --> 49:53.790
talked about tours and recording,

49:55.391 --> 49:57.224
I can't fucking believe it, man.

49:57.226 --> 49:59.863
One fucking gig.

50:00.462 --> 50:02.998
- See you later, Steve-o!
- Right.

50:03.098 --> 50:04.264
Come on, boys.

50:04.266 --> 50:07.403
Remember the date, and smile.

50:08.237 --> 50:09.906
You too, Steven.

50:14.009 --> 50:16.043
I said you'd be back in on Monday.

50:16.045 --> 50:18.045
Yes but did you have to say I had diarrhea?

50:18.047 --> 50:19.948
I've run out of excuses.

50:22.418 --> 50:23.620
So...

50:24.152 --> 50:26.453
Tell me all about it.

50:26.455 --> 50:29.825
I've never experienced
anything like it before.

50:32.828 --> 50:36.466
And now I know how you must
feel when you do your knitting.

50:47.043 --> 50:49.342
You skivvying off again.

50:49.344 --> 50:51.747
I've got far more important
things to consider.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.849
Like what?

50:54.350 --> 50:56.052
Tell her about your gig.

50:59.956 --> 51:01.387
It went really well.

51:01.389 --> 51:03.556
Great.

51:03.558 --> 51:07.094
So can I take today off
'cause I don't like Thursdays?

51:07.096 --> 51:10.029
It's not like I want to spend
my life stocking shelves.

51:10.031 --> 51:12.266
Well, I hate to break
it to you, Jacqueline,

51:12.268 --> 51:14.768
the way things are looking,

51:14.770 --> 51:18.475
it looks like there might be one
less worker bee in the Morrissey hive.

51:23.179 --> 51:24.647
What's this?

51:24.947 --> 51:25.945
Studio time.

51:25.947 --> 51:27.883
Gigs, stardom.

51:29.685 --> 51:31.120
This is in London.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.255
And?

51:34.257 --> 51:37.324
And what is plan B if
that doesn't work out?

51:37.326 --> 51:39.293
My alphabet has only one letter.

51:39.295 --> 51:41.427
What? D for dickhead.

51:41.429 --> 51:43.364
Just because the height of your ambition

51:43.366 --> 51:46.532
is aisle five, doesn't mean that I'm
gonna slum it here for the rest of my life.

51:46.534 --> 51:48.034
What are you talking about?

51:48.036 --> 51:50.337
Once they discover my genius,
it's inevitable I'll move.

51:50.339 --> 51:51.771
You've done one gig.

51:51.773 --> 51:53.175
That's enough, you two.

51:53.976 --> 51:55.678
I don't have to listen to this.

51:56.279 --> 51:59.079
Clean up on aisle five.

51:59.081 --> 52:01.050
Clean up on aisle five.

52:18.900 --> 52:20.202
No?

52:21.569 --> 52:22.838
All right.

52:23.839 --> 52:25.073
Here, mate.

52:26.074 --> 52:27.875
We talked last week.

52:27.877 --> 52:30.277
We were fucked by your
third song, but still.

52:30.279 --> 52:32.313
This a private meeting
or can anybody join in?

52:32.315 --> 52:34.117
Did you know Steve was in a band?

52:34.449 --> 52:36.016
No, no, I didn't, no.

52:36.018 --> 52:38.921
And I don't care. Get back to
your desk and start working.

53:05.348 --> 53:09.352
<i>I sometimes feel like the
subject of a Lowry painting.</i>

53:12.221 --> 53:14.356
<i>I've never wanted to paint anything.</i>

53:16.592 --> 53:18.595
<i>But look at these walls.</i>

53:23.398 --> 53:25.532
<i>Returning to the real world</i>

53:25.534 --> 53:28.871
<i>is like stepping into a cold shower.</i>

53:31.239 --> 53:33.507
<i>Where the dress code is smart...</i>

53:33.509 --> 53:35.275
Where the hell is he now?

53:35.277 --> 53:37.613
<i>And the people less so.</i>

53:38.781 --> 53:39.813
Lazy bastard.

53:39.815 --> 53:42.882
<i>And your ambition
is to start each day</i>

53:42.884 --> 53:45.787
<i>and still exist by the end of it.</i>

53:50.259 --> 53:52.058
<i>At least Lowry had smog.</i>

53:56.766 --> 53:59.002
<i>We've got nothing to choke on.</i>

54:09.478 --> 54:11.411
This is what you call
the records room, is it?

54:11.413 --> 54:13.081
On the fucking roof!

54:14.382 --> 54:15.516
I was actually...

54:15.518 --> 54:17.150
Yeah, I know exactly what
you're get up to up here.

54:17.152 --> 54:19.386
Writing bollocks about
what fucking idiots we are!

54:19.388 --> 54:20.621
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Steven.

54:20.623 --> 54:23.059
What goes around, comes around.

54:29.598 --> 54:31.267
What are you writing now?

54:32.668 --> 54:34.367
It's none of your business.

54:34.369 --> 54:35.938
I'll be the judge of that.

54:37.973 --> 54:39.473
Fine.

54:39.475 --> 54:41.741
Fine. You get back to your desk.

54:41.743 --> 54:43.677
I'll deal with this after lunch.

54:43.679 --> 54:45.881
You make a note in your fucking book.

55:28.424 --> 55:29.992
Morrissey.

55:37.699 --> 55:39.735
Right.

55:40.201 --> 55:41.837
You know why you're here?

55:42.971 --> 55:45.273
I'm not paying you to
write in your notebook.

55:45.641 --> 55:47.176
Or be in a pop band.

55:47.643 --> 55:49.278
I'm paying you to work.

55:51.346 --> 55:53.148
But it's not just that, Steven.

55:53.715 --> 55:56.418
Your attitude stinks.

55:57.319 --> 55:59.186
You're never at your desk at 9:00,

55:59.188 --> 56:00.587
if you're here at all.

56:00.589 --> 56:02.892
And when you are in,
your mind is elsewhere.

56:04.025 --> 56:06.361
I don't owe you a living, Steven.

56:10.366 --> 56:11.901
But,

56:13.034 --> 56:14.201
I'm a fair man.

56:14.203 --> 56:15.805
You know that.

56:16.038 --> 56:18.538
So, I thought,

56:18.540 --> 56:20.907
I would give you one more opportunity

56:20.909 --> 56:23.945
to convince me that
things are going to change.

56:26.214 --> 56:28.016
You can't live two lives.

56:29.183 --> 56:31.119
Work, or music.

56:31.686 --> 56:33.189
What's it gonna be?

56:48.871 --> 56:52.175
Ah, the famous Steve Morrissey.

56:55.444 --> 56:56.742
I'm not gonna miss you.

56:56.744 --> 56:57.914
Liar.

56:59.781 --> 57:01.480
So...

57:01.482 --> 57:03.919
Did you jump, or were you pushed?

57:05.453 --> 57:07.055
Creative differences.

57:09.123 --> 57:11.259
Just when I was going
to shoot you in the head.

57:12.060 --> 57:13.496
I'm sorry to disappoint.

57:20.735 --> 57:22.304
What time is the train?

57:23.404 --> 57:24.840
We've got plenty of time.

57:28.143 --> 57:29.412
Are you worried?

57:32.447 --> 57:34.282
London belongs to me.

57:40.889 --> 57:44.991
As I wandered thro' each charter'd street,

57:44.993 --> 57:49.130
Near where the charter'd Thames does flow,

57:49.598 --> 57:51.566
And mark in every face I meet

57:52.433 --> 57:54.903
Marks of weakness,

57:55.170 --> 57:56.505
Marks of woe.

57:58.641 --> 57:59.739
I can't remember the rest.

57:59.741 --> 58:02.808
In every cry of every man...

58:02.810 --> 58:05.180
You see, what am I gonna do without you?

58:09.150 --> 58:10.485
Die.

58:11.487 --> 58:13.122
Lonely and depressed.

58:21.663 --> 58:23.396
Give it a rest, will you?

58:23.398 --> 58:25.467
Some of us have still work to go to.

59:53.522 --> 59:56.021
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi, Billy.

59:56.023 --> 59:57.193
<i>Steven.</i>

59:57.292 --> 59:58.660
It's...

59:59.494 --> 01:00:01.128
I dropped off a tape.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.433
- <i>I got it.</i>
- And what do you think?

01:00:05.299 --> 01:00:08.400
<i>It's really good, mate.</i>

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:13.974
I was thinking that maybe we should
be the ones that demo for the manager.

01:00:13.976 --> 01:00:16.579
- <i>He called me this morning.</i>
- Oh great! Did he...

01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:19.514
Did he say when we were going?

01:00:20.415 --> 01:00:21.751
Billy?

01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:24.086
<i>I'm sorry, Steve.</i>

01:00:24.953 --> 01:00:27.088
<i>They just want me to go.</i>

01:00:30.993 --> 01:00:33.329
But I don't understand.

01:00:34.929 --> 01:00:38.398
<i>They want a new
guitarist for this band.</i>

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.169
<i>It's all lined up.</i>

01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:42.470
<i>And yeah.</i>

01:00:44.806 --> 01:00:46.474
<i>I'm sorry, Steve.</i>

01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:48.677
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.046
<i>I can't turn it down.</i>

01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:56.552
<i>Steve? Are you still there?</i>

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.951
Yes, still here.

01:00:58.953 --> 01:01:01.222
<i>I can't turn it down, mate.</i>

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:03.192
I know.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.829
<i>Anyway, look, you
remember my mate, Johnny?</i>

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.963
<i>Well, he's looking
to start something.</i>

01:01:10.965 --> 01:01:12.498
<i>So I mentioned you.</i>

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.269
<i>I'll give you his number.</i>

01:01:14.969 --> 01:01:16.438
<i>Have you got a pen?</i>

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:21.777
I'll get one.

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:15.728
Mum said you'd forget.

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:17.900
- What?
- Doctor's appointment.

01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:22.838
You can't just lock yourself away.

01:02:23.237 --> 01:02:24.572
Okay.

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:31.945
You've been in here for six weeks.

01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:33.883
- Seven.
- I'm being serious.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.652
- Steven
- What?

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:42.390
Mum's worried.

01:02:43.491 --> 01:02:44.860
When is it?

01:02:45.259 --> 01:02:46.628
Twenty minutes.

01:03:12.888 --> 01:03:15.224
I don't think these are gonna help.

01:03:20.027 --> 01:03:21.663
Tell me what the doctor said.

01:03:26.735 --> 01:03:28.571
Did you explain how you were feeling?

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:42.951
Are you hungry?

01:03:43.451 --> 01:03:44.852
I'll make you some food.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.674
So what's it like down there then?

01:04:41.676 --> 01:04:43.308
<i>Well...</i>

01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:46.945
<i>I live in a shoe box, and all
anyone talks about is hammers.</i>

01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:48.784
<i>When are you coming?</i>

01:04:50.284 --> 01:04:52.018
Soon.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.523
<i>You'd clean up down here, there's
loads of people you could meet.</i>

01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:57.926
<i>You should come down.</i>

01:05:00.027 --> 01:05:00.994
I should, shouldn't I?

01:05:00.996 --> 01:05:02.364
<i>Yes.</i>

01:05:02.797 --> 01:05:04.463
<i>Check the train guide.</i>

01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:05.565
I will.

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:07.569
<i>If you need, I'll
lend you the money.</i>

01:05:12.373 --> 01:05:13.440
<i>So...</i>

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.611
<i>Anything new happening up there?</i>

01:05:16.978 --> 01:05:19.415
There's a new bag of cement in the cellar.

01:05:20.648 --> 01:05:22.315
I was planning my visit...

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:24.919
<i>You know Billy's playing
in Manchester next month?</i>

01:05:27.621 --> 01:05:29.490
<i>He always asks about you.</i>

01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:34.360
And?

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:38.331
<i>And I told him you're
writing your obituary.</i>

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:43.072
<i>Anyway, he said he'd put
you on the guest list.</i>

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.407
<i>Hello? Are you even listening to me?</i>

01:05:47.409 --> 01:05:48.644
Not really. No.

01:05:51.712 --> 01:05:53.612
<i>Are you all right, Shakespeare?</i>

01:05:53.614 --> 01:05:55.383
<i>You sound lost.</i>

01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:58.918
Now, I can see where I'm going.

01:06:14.368 --> 01:06:17.538
- How are you?
- Thanks for coming.

01:06:21.409 --> 01:06:22.578
Right.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:38.059
How is he? Any change?

01:06:39.694 --> 01:06:40.863
I'm running out of ideas.

01:06:43.264 --> 01:06:44.898
Well, if it helps,

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.733
there's a job going on at the hospital.

01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:48.137
I could put in a word.

01:07:24.772 --> 01:07:29.544
<i>The most used noun in the
English language is time.</i>

01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:33.014
<i>And I'm running out of it.</i>

01:07:36.183 --> 01:07:38.453
<i>You win, Christine.</i>

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:41.023
<i>You've won.</i>

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:49.731
<i>Some of us want to dream
and keep on dreaming.</i>

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.068
<i>Think of us.</i>

01:07:54.302 --> 01:07:55.904
<i>And protect us.</i>

01:08:03.478 --> 01:08:07.182
<i>The lion and the lamb
shall lie down together.</i>

01:08:14.221 --> 01:08:16.157
<i>Down together we go.</i>

01:08:31.471 --> 01:08:33.741
Look at the state here.

01:08:35.142 --> 01:08:36.743
I'll take the job.

01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:39.045
What?

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:40.749
The hospital job. I...

01:08:42.316 --> 01:08:44.986
I need the money, I
want to see Linder, so...

01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:23.010
Everything all right?

01:11:27.115 --> 01:11:28.850
Is Linder still enjoying London?

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:34.856
You could have probably get
there and back ten times by now.

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.759
Steven.

01:12:14.562 --> 01:12:16.131
Were you a friend?

01:13:37.411 --> 01:13:38.914
<i>Life.</i>

01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:42.550
<i>In its humdrum sense is worth</i>

01:13:43.116 --> 01:13:44.585
<i>avoiding.</i>

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.420
<i>It's the factory for the father,</i>

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.854
<i>and the kitchen for mother.</i>

01:13:49.856 --> 01:13:52.658
<i>It's arguments at the dinner table.</i>

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.760
<i>Missing children on the news.</i>

01:13:54.762 --> 01:14:00.468
<i>And through it all, a sense that
things are slowly falling apart.</i>

01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:05.938
<i>Is it better to
choose another record</i>

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.506
<i>to flip the lid on the pills</i>

01:14:07.508 --> 01:14:10.078
<i>and wait for something to happen?</i>

01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:14.279
<i>Is it better to turn out the lights,</i>

01:14:14.281 --> 01:14:15.948
<i>climb under the covers,</i>

01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:20.354
<i>until sleep invites you to a
world you've always wanted.</i>

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.893
<i>Is it better than the one
that's in front of us?</i>

01:14:44.512 --> 01:14:46.314
I like what you've done to the place.

01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:06.968
I really don't know how to carry on, Mum.

01:15:15.543 --> 01:15:17.979
I remember when you first heard this.

01:15:18.679 --> 01:15:20.581
We couldn't get you down off the table.

01:15:24.485 --> 01:15:26.217
Do you remember why I bought you this?

01:15:26.219 --> 01:15:27.385
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:27.387 --> 01:15:30.090
And the books, and the typewriter.

01:15:31.659 --> 01:15:33.359
It's just not me anymore.

01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:37.499
Then who are you?

01:15:39.232 --> 01:15:42.635
Are you the boy who stood
on the table and sang to me

01:15:42.637 --> 01:15:44.372
or are you just like everyone else?

01:15:45.106 --> 01:15:46.305
Giving up,

01:15:46.307 --> 01:15:48.073
with nothing to say.

01:15:48.075 --> 01:15:49.809
I've tried, Mum.

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.377
It's not like I haven't tried.

01:15:51.379 --> 01:15:53.548
What else am I supposed to do?

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:59.621
The world, it's just not
built for people like me.

01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:05.093
Then create your own world, Steven.

01:16:08.262 --> 01:16:09.997
You'll get there.

01:16:11.465 --> 01:16:13.101
I know you will.

01:16:15.937 --> 01:16:18.237
But only when you realize

01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:19.741
you have a choice.

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:24.612
Not everyone's so lucky.

01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:36.024
You are the only version
of yourself in existence.

01:16:36.723 --> 01:16:39.460
There is no replica of you.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.331
You just have to be who you are.

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:47.001
Isn't that worth life?

01:16:49.203 --> 01:16:50.604
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

01:16:52.106 --> 01:16:53.475
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:17:00.681 --> 01:17:03.251
You could have at least
torn the wallpaper down.

01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:24.131
Anything else?

01:18:26.032 --> 01:18:27.735
That's one pound, 50, please.

01:18:37.578 --> 01:18:39.347
<i>The past is</i>

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.851
<i>everything I have failed to be.</i>

01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:48.354
<i>It was the ease of doing nothing</i>

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:51.259
<i>over the fear of doing something.</i>

01:18:53.393 --> 01:18:54.960
<i>Do I carry those defeats</i>

01:18:54.962 --> 01:18:57.599
<i>and emerge with a flag of victory?</i>

01:19:00.433 --> 01:19:02.303
<i>It could be the start of something.</i>

01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:08.342
<i>Even though the world does not
want your dance and your glitter.</i>

01:19:13.013 --> 01:19:16.450
<i>Men were born to pray and save.</i>

01:19:18.052 --> 01:19:20.688
<i>Romantic England's dead and gone.</i>

01:19:21.856 --> 01:19:24.592
<i>It's with Jane Austen in the grave.</i>

01:21:00.788 --> 01:21:03.454
I'm afraid that there's not
much demand for pop stars

01:21:03.456 --> 01:21:04.892
in the Stratford area.

01:21:05.759 --> 01:21:07.394
And can you even sing?

01:21:09.396 --> 01:21:10.462
Now,

01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:12.967
Ringway Airport, looking
for car park attendants.

01:21:15.535 --> 01:21:16.737
Fine.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.941
Meat packing in a grocery store?

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:28.313
Ah. Bricklayers.

01:21:28.315 --> 01:21:30.248
People always need houses, Steven.

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:31.852
Job for a life, is that.

01:21:32.919 --> 01:21:36.390
Do you ever wake up and think,

01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:39.861
"I wonder if I could have been a poet."

01:21:40.361 --> 01:21:41.529
What?

01:21:41.762 --> 01:21:43.298
Do you think,

01:21:43.496 --> 01:21:45.197
that if you tried,

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:47.698
just a little bit harder

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.369
that you could have made it.

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:52.607
That maybe, instead of...

01:21:53.807 --> 01:21:55.375
All this,

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.010
you could have gone down in history.

01:21:59.012 --> 01:22:00.378
Steven...

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.848
It's me interviewing you,
not the other way around.

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:06.417
Manchester's first Nobel laureate.

01:22:06.419 --> 01:22:07.985
Look, son.

01:22:07.987 --> 01:22:09.755
You might think it's okay to quit your job.

01:22:09.757 --> 01:22:12.091
But there are two million other blokes
out there who are looking for work,

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.126
so I suggest that you stop
pointing your finger out,

01:22:14.128 --> 01:22:16.363
and stop wasting my bloody time.

01:22:24.204 --> 01:22:26.006
You can do it, sir.

01:22:27.775 --> 01:22:29.477
I believe in you.

01:22:36.883 --> 01:22:38.649
Oh...

01:22:38.651 --> 01:22:42.789
And if you ever do find a
bricklayer floating in the Irwell,

01:22:43.691 --> 01:22:45.026
it'll be me.

01:23:02.676 --> 01:23:04.612
I'm heading in to work. You want something?

01:23:11.118 --> 01:23:12.786
You're sure that's enough?

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:19.427
Make sure you eat something
today that isn't toast.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.732
But I like toast.

01:23:51.691 --> 01:23:52.890
You all right?

01:23:52.892 --> 01:23:54.461
I'm Johnny.

01:23:55.862 --> 01:23:58.131
I got your address off Billy.

01:23:59.633 --> 01:24:02.367
Look, you probably
don't remember me, but...

01:24:02.369 --> 01:24:03.537
I do.

01:24:04.704 --> 01:24:07.474
I play a bit, and...

01:24:08.542 --> 01:24:09.911
Can I come in?

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:25.826
Have you read all these?

01:24:26.826 --> 01:24:28.129
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:39.873
Some top stuff in here.

01:24:41.542 --> 01:24:43.408
They don't make stuff like this anymore.

01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:44.779
You know what I mean?

01:24:47.114 --> 01:24:49.050
Would you like to play one?

01:24:52.953 --> 01:24:54.488
All right.

01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:45.939
Would you care for some toast?

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.043
Yeah.

01:25:49.543 --> 01:25:50.711
Cheers.

01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:12.797
So? 1:00 then?

01:26:12.799 --> 01:26:14.166
1:00.

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:15.466
Shit! Almost forgot.

01:26:15.468 --> 01:26:18.039
Billy said these are yours?

01:26:18.739 --> 01:26:19.941
See you tomorrow.

01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:13.917
