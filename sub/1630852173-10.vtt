WEBVTT

00:12.679 --> 00:14.981
<i>You fucking cheated?</i>

00:15.048 --> 00:16.583
<i>But you're, like, a nerd.</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:17.650
<i>I don't know, guys. Is she?</i>

00:17.717 --> 00:19.152
<i>She's cheating on tests,</i>

00:19.219 --> 00:21.688
<i>trying to bang a dude</i>
<i>on a teacher's desk.</i>

00:21.755 --> 00:23.256
<i>I think she's,</i>
<i>like, a bad girl.</i>

00:23.356 --> 00:25.025
<i>- Well, now I have a meeting</i>
<i>with President Lacey</i>

00:25.091 --> 00:26.559
<i>and the Honor Board</i>
<i>to plead my case</i>

00:26.659 --> 00:28.328
<i>so that they don't expel me.</i>

00:28.395 --> 00:30.363
<i>- Damn, girl, your life's</i>
<i>a fucking mess right now.</i>

00:30.430 --> 00:31.865
<i>- Bela--</i>
<i>- No, she's right. It is.</i>

00:31.931 --> 00:34.267
<i>- Well, it is all going</i>
<i>to work itself out.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:35.769
<i>Okay, and if it doesn't,</i>
<i>then...</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:40.673
<i>Then what?</i>

00:40.740 --> 00:42.175
<i>- I don't know, okay?</i>
<i>I thought you guys would</i>

00:42.242 --> 00:43.443
<i>jump in with</i>
<i>something encouraging.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:44.944
<i>- Leighton!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God! Ugh.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.280
<i>- Okay, let's focus</i>
<i>on the positives, right?</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.849
<i>Midterms are over and</i>
<i>tonight we're going to rage</i>

00:49.916 --> 00:51.951
<i>our brains out at the</i>
<i>Anything But Clothes party.</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:53.953
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.356
<i>- I, for one, will be making</i>
<i>a tasteful but extremely</i>

00:56.423 --> 00:58.124
<i>revealing minidress</i>
<i>made out of caution tape.</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:01.127
<i>And caution, I will</i>
<i>be showing some ass meat.</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:03.363
<i>- Can you please not say</i>
<i>"ass meat" while we are eating?</i>

01:03.430 --> 01:04.798
<i>- Leighton,</i>
<i>you're so repressed.</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:06.633
<i>Table poll,</i>
<i>is the phrase "ass meat"</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:09.436
<i>repulsive or charming?</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:11.638
<i>- I don't like it.</i>
<i>- It's not great.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:12.972
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:14.808
<i>Well, here comes Nico.</i>
<i>I'll ask him.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:16.743
<i>Damn, he looks kind of mad.</i>

01:16.810 --> 01:19.145
<i>- Leighton,</i>
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:19.245 --> 01:20.814
<i>- I'm kind of busy right now.</i>
<i>Can it wait?</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:22.749
<i>No, it can't. Let's go.</i>

01:24.451 --> 01:25.952
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:32.559 --> 01:34.461
<i>- I mean, we're going</i>
<i>to go eavesdrop, right?</i>

01:34.561 --> 01:35.662
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:46.106 --> 01:47.841
<i>- You had no right</i>
<i>to say anything to Maya.</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.642
<i>- You were cheating</i>
<i>on two of my friends.</i>

01:49.742 --> 01:51.311
<i>I am not the one</i>
<i>who was in the wrong here.</i>

01:51.411 --> 01:52.979
<i>- I just don't understand</i>
<i>why you would do this to me.</i>

01:53.079 --> 01:55.648
<i>- Oh, please,</i>
<i>no one did anything</i> <i> to</i> <i> you.</i>

01:55.748 --> 01:57.851
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>
<i>I just put a stop to it.</i>

01:57.951 --> 02:00.186
<i>- I just hate thinking</i>
<i>that they're fighting about me.</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:01.855
<i>- No, I don't think</i>
<i>this is all about you.</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:04.491
<i>- Because you fucked Kimberly,</i>
<i>that's why!</i>

02:04.591 --> 02:06.359
<i>- I mean, a good amount</i>
<i>is about you, sure.</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:07.760
<i>- What would you know</i>
<i>about this anyway?</i>

02:07.827 --> 02:09.028
<i>You've literally never dated</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:10.763
<i>anyone seriously</i>
<i>in your entire life.</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:12.665
<i>Oh, you were all about</i>
<i>Cory and then you go on</i>

02:12.765 --> 02:14.033
<i>one date with him,</i>
<i>and you ghost him.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:16.035
<i>Uh, because he was boring.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:18.471
<i>Have you seen his Instagram?</i>
<i>It's all sunsets.</i>

02:20.206 --> 02:22.542
<i>- Do you think they stopped?</i>
<i>I can't hear anything anymore.</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:24.611
<i>It's so quiet.</i>

02:24.677 --> 02:26.212
<i>- We just got here.</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:30.049
<i>- I'm so sorry my hand grazed</i>
<i>whatever it grazed.</i>

02:30.150 --> 02:31.651
- <i>Hey.</i>
<i>- Did you guys hear all that?</i>

02:31.718 --> 02:32.719
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Huh? No.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:34.787
<i>No, the doors are very thick.</i>

02:34.854 --> 02:36.723
<i>- They're lying.</i>
<i>I heard it from the bathroom.</i>

02:45.965 --> 02:48.201
<i>- Eric?</i>
<i>- Up here.</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:50.803
<i>- You sure you want</i>
<i>to be here for this?</i>

02:50.870 --> 02:52.138
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

02:56.176 --> 02:58.545
<i>Uh, what's going on?</i>

02:58.645 --> 03:00.079
<i>We know what you did to Bela.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:01.381
<i>And to Carla.</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:05.552
<i>- Okay, well, I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

03:05.652 --> 03:07.487
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

03:07.554 --> 03:08.855
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

03:08.922 --> 03:11.224
<i>You assaulted both of us</i>
<i>and you know it.</i>

03:11.324 --> 03:13.393
<i>- Look, you can deny it</i>
<i>all you want,</i>

03:13.493 --> 03:16.863
<i>but we believe them,</i>
<i>and we made our decision.</i>

03:16.930 --> 03:18.865
<i>We're kicking you out.</i>

03:18.932 --> 03:21.234
<i>- Wait, can we slow down</i>
<i>for a second?</i>

03:21.334 --> 03:24.604
<i>You're really going</i>
<i>to take her word over mine?</i>

03:24.704 --> 03:26.673
<i>The girl who gave</i>
<i>eight hand jobs?</i>

03:26.739 --> 03:28.274
<i>Um, it was six hand jobs.</i>

03:28.374 --> 03:30.109
<i>- And who cares how many</i>
<i>fucking hand jobs she gave?</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:32.011
<i>It doesn't make her</i>
<i>any less credible, you shit.</i>

03:32.078 --> 03:33.580
<i>- Dude, you know</i>
<i>I wouldn't do this.</i>

03:33.680 --> 03:35.415
<i>- So two different women</i>
<i>are just saying this</i>

03:35.515 --> 03:37.183
<i>to take you down</i>
<i>for no reason?</i>

03:37.250 --> 03:38.851
<i>It doesn't make any sense and</i>
<i>we're not gonna ignore that.</i>

03:38.918 --> 03:41.287
- <i>It's done.</i>
<i>- You can't just kick me out.</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:43.590
- <i>I'm a coeditor.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:49.929
<i>- Looks like</i>
<i>you're not anymore.</i>

04:01.741 --> 04:03.476
<i>Yes!</i>

04:10.216 --> 04:12.485
<i>- Oh, now I see why</i>
<i>you invited me over.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:14.988
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>I'm using you for your body.</i>

04:15.088 --> 04:16.723
<i>Mm.</i>

04:17.824 --> 04:19.659
<i>- What are you</i>
<i>gonna do about it?</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:22.895
<i>- I'ma go willingly.</i>
<i>That's what I'm gonna do.</i>

04:24.330 --> 04:26.165
<i>I'm taking my shirt off.</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:27.634
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

04:27.734 --> 04:30.637
<i>It's just weird doing this</i>
<i>in Kimberly's room.</i>

04:30.737 --> 04:32.472
<i>Is that her big-ass bra</i>
<i>behind you?</i>

04:32.572 --> 04:35.074
<i>- Just ignore it.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

04:35.141 --> 04:36.576
<i>And look at my bra.</i>

04:36.643 --> 04:40.847
<i>- Yes, it is a very,</i>
<i>very good bra.</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:42.482
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

04:42.582 --> 04:44.484
- <i>Should I take it off?</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

04:44.584 --> 04:46.653
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>Oh, my God, dude.</i>

04:46.753 --> 04:48.588
<i>- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>It's just weird.</i>

04:48.655 --> 04:51.291
<i>It's weird having sex</i>
<i>in your coworker's room.</i>

04:51.357 --> 04:54.527
<i>Her stuffed panda</i>
<i>is staring at me.</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:55.695
<i>That's Penny.</i>

04:55.795 --> 04:57.664
<i>Don't tell me Penny's name.</i>

05:01.634 --> 05:04.103
<i>- Whitney.</i>

05:04.170 --> 05:05.772
<i>Whitney, are you in there?</i>

05:05.838 --> 05:07.307
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

05:07.373 --> 05:08.608
<i>- My mom is here.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

05:08.675 --> 05:09.709
<i>- My mom is</i>
<i>at the fucking door.</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:10.977
<i>Oh.</i>

05:11.044 --> 05:12.345
<i>- Here,</i>
<i>put your fucking shirt on.</i>

05:12.445 --> 05:13.479
<i>- Okay,</i>
<i>you don't got to throw it.</i>

05:13.546 --> 05:15.348
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

05:15.448 --> 05:16.983
<i>Oh, my...</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:19.118
<i>Mom, what are you doing here?</i>

05:19.185 --> 05:20.653
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>on your book tour?</i>

05:20.720 --> 05:22.288
<i>- I am, but I thought</i>
<i>I'd make an extra stop</i>

05:22.355 --> 05:24.624
<i>over here to ask you</i>
<i>about this.</i>

05:26.159 --> 05:27.727
<i>- Okay, I just finished</i>
<i>installing</i>

05:27.827 --> 05:30.296
<i>your antivirus software.</i>
<i>Uh, all done.</i>

05:30.363 --> 05:32.031
<i>- You put your shirt</i>
<i>on backwards.</i>

05:33.132 --> 05:35.034
<i>Mom, this is Canaan.</i>

05:35.134 --> 05:36.903
<i>Uh, he--okay.</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
<i>- I'm going to see you later.</i>
<i>- Yeah, go.</i>

05:41.407 --> 05:43.810
<i>- Kimmy-bean.</i>

05:43.876 --> 05:45.478
<i>Perfect timing.</i>
<i>Look who's at the store.</i>

05:45.545 --> 05:47.814
<i>It's your third grade teacher,</i>
<i>Mrs. Jarvis.</i>

05:47.880 --> 05:49.515
<i>Hi, Mrs. Jarvis.</i>

05:49.582 --> 05:51.351
<i>I can't see her.</i>

05:52.685 --> 05:55.088
<i>- Aisle four.</i>
<i>She's got a real deep cough.</i>

05:55.188 --> 05:56.155
<i>Very, very wet.</i>

05:56.222 --> 05:58.091
<i>Dad, I need to talk to you.</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.493
<i>Oh, is everything okay?</i>

06:00.560 --> 06:02.061
<i>I kind of did something bad.</i>

06:02.161 --> 06:03.830
<i>- Kimberly, whatever it is,</i>
<i>you can tell me.</i>

06:03.896 --> 06:05.365
<i>There's nothing you could say</i>

06:05.431 --> 06:07.100
<i>that would make me</i>
<i>disappointed in you.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.769
<i>- I cheated on a test</i>
<i>and I got caught.</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:11.871
<i>And now I might get expelled.</i>

06:11.938 --> 06:13.740
<i>Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.</i>

06:13.840 --> 06:15.942
<i>- Dad, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I know I messed up.</i>

06:16.042 --> 06:18.077
<i>I--just please</i>
<i>don't be mad at me.</i>

06:18.177 --> 06:19.612
<i>Of course I'm mad.</i>

06:19.712 --> 06:21.114
<i>What the hell, Kimmy?</i>
<i>This isn't like you.</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:22.715
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>- What were you thinking?</i>

06:22.782 --> 06:25.284
<i>- I wasn't, that's the problem.</i>
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:28.788
- <i>I don't know how to tell mom.</i>
<i>- Oh, God, don't do that.</i>

06:28.888 --> 06:30.123
<i>We can just keep this</i>
<i>between us.</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:31.624
<i>She will lose her shit.</i>

06:31.724 --> 06:33.626
<i>Kimmy, it's okay</i>
<i>to not be perfect for once.</i>

06:33.726 --> 06:35.128
<i>Lord knows I'm not perfect.</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:36.696
<i>Remember when</i>
<i>I left grandpa's ashes</i>

06:36.763 --> 06:38.364
<i>on the roof of the car</i>
<i>and drove away?</i>

06:40.366 --> 06:41.534
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

06:41.601 --> 06:43.035
<i>I love you, too.</i>

06:43.102 --> 06:45.037
<i>But you got to find</i>
<i>a way to fix this.</i>

06:46.973 --> 06:48.107
<i>We'll see.</i>

06:56.883 --> 06:59.485
<i>- Mom, why are you</i>
<i>just showing up like this?</i>

06:59.585 --> 07:00.987
<i>You could've called.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:02.488
<i>- And you could've called me</i>
<i>to tell me your team</i>

07:02.588 --> 07:04.490
<i>was involved in</i>
<i>a full-blown sex scandal.</i>

07:04.590 --> 07:06.559
<i>Little suspicious</i>
<i>I had to hear about it</i>

07:06.626 --> 07:07.827
<i>from Carl instead of you.</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:09.295
<i>Carl, what the hell?</i>

07:09.395 --> 07:12.098
<i>Okay, yeah, well, Mom,</i>
<i>you're wasting your time.</i>

07:12.165 --> 07:14.734
- <i>Everything's fine.</i>
<i>- Everything is not fine.</i>

07:14.801 --> 07:16.669
<i>One of the coaches</i>
<i>was molesting a girl.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:19.772
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>No one was being molested.</i>

07:21.941 --> 07:24.343
<i>I'm just saying.</i>
<i>They were both adults.</i>

07:24.444 --> 07:27.580
<i>And it's over.</i>
<i>He's fired. He's gone.</i>

07:29.248 --> 07:30.650
<i>Whitney,</i>

07:30.750 --> 07:34.020
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>I'm going to ask you this,</i>

07:34.120 --> 07:38.691
<i>but since you don't tell me</i>
<i>anything about your life,</i>

07:38.791 --> 07:40.827
<i>is it you?</i>

07:40.927 --> 07:42.929
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Well, then, who was it?</i>

07:42.995 --> 07:45.097
<i>I need to make sure she's okay.</i>

07:46.966 --> 07:48.701
<i>You told her what?</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:16.996
<i>Jeff, for the last time,</i>

08:17.063 --> 08:19.499
<i>pieces about your cousin</i>
<i>are not funny.</i>

08:19.565 --> 08:21.234
<i>Nobody knows who Emma is.</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.002
<i>- She's, like,</i>
<i>crazy into horses.</i>

08:23.069 --> 08:24.737
<i>There might be something there.</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:26.138
<i>There's nothing there.</i>

08:26.205 --> 08:28.140
<i>- Bela, your piece about</i>
<i>Frankenstein being Jewish</i>

08:28.207 --> 08:30.676
<i>and going on birthright</i>
<i>is pretty solid. Good work.</i>

08:30.743 --> 08:32.078
<i>Everyone else, please make sure</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:33.746
<i>you send in two more ideas</i>
<i>by tomorrow.</i>

08:33.846 --> 08:36.182
<i>And, also, be sure to CC</i>
<i>our new coeditor, Evangeline.</i>

08:36.249 --> 08:38.217
<i>- Uh, hello,</i>
<i>you forgot to mention</i>

08:38.317 --> 08:41.187
<i>the first female coeditor</i>
<i>in "Catullan" history.</i>

08:41.254 --> 08:43.256
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Come on, guys.</i>

08:43.356 --> 08:45.091
- <i>Yes, girl!</i>
<i>- Whoo.</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
<i>Hey, I just want to say,</i>

08:46.926 --> 08:48.160
<i>I think the way</i>
<i>things went down</i>

08:48.227 --> 08:50.062
<i>with Ryan was</i>
<i>kind of fucked up.</i>

08:50.162 --> 08:51.898
<i>And to be honest,</i>
<i>some other people do, too.</i>

08:51.998 --> 08:53.933
<i>- If you want</i>
<i>to defend a predator,</i>

08:54.033 --> 08:55.601
- <i>maybe you should leave, too.</i>
<i>- Whoa, whoa.</i>

08:55.701 --> 08:57.236
<i>I don't think we need</i>
<i>to kick anymore people out.</i>

08:57.336 --> 08:59.872
<i>- It was Ryan's word</i>
<i>against someone else's.</i>

08:59.939 --> 09:01.541
<i>- Ryan's word didn't make</i>
<i>any fucking sense.</i>

09:01.607 --> 09:03.109
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

09:03.209 --> 09:04.844
<i>- Says the girl</i>
<i>who benefitted from his exit.</i>

09:04.911 --> 09:06.612
<i>- Are you fucking kidding me?</i>
<i>- All right, everyone.</i>

09:06.712 --> 09:08.114
<i>If we could calm down</i>
<i>and get back to the meeting--</i>

09:08.214 --> 09:09.782
<i>- Actually, I'm gonna go.</i>
<i>- You should stay.</i>

09:09.882 --> 09:12.618
- <i>He should go.</i>
<i>- No, I want to go.</i>

09:12.718 --> 09:15.555
<i>I came to Essex</i>
<i>because of "The Catullan,"</i>

09:15.621 --> 09:17.456
<i>but I think it might suck.</i>

09:17.557 --> 09:19.225
<i>In two months,</i>
<i>I've been called a slut,</i>

09:19.292 --> 09:20.793
<i>I've been hate crimed</i>
<i>by an alum,</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:22.962
<i>had some dude's dick</i>
<i>jammed into my back.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:24.797
<i>If this is what being on</i>
<i>"The Catullan" is like,</i>

09:24.897 --> 09:26.299
<i>I'm sorry, I'm good without it.</i>

09:38.411 --> 09:39.812
<i>I've decided what I'm going</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:41.380
<i>to tell</i>
<i>the disciplinary committee.</i>

09:41.447 --> 09:43.149
<i>I'm going to present them</i>
<i>with a compelling,</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:46.485
<i>thoughtful, at times humorous</i>
<i>statement on who I am</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:49.221
<i>and how I plan to learn</i>
<i>from this experience.</i>

09:49.288 --> 09:50.556
<i>Bitch, I'm asleep.</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:52.224
<i>You can't go in there</i>
<i>empty-handed.</i>

09:52.291 --> 09:53.593
<i>If you want them</i>
<i>to go easy on you,</i>

09:53.659 --> 09:54.994
<i>you have to</i>
<i>bring them something.</i>

09:55.094 --> 09:57.096
<i>- Like treats?</i>
<i>- Like evidence, honey.</i>

09:57.163 --> 09:59.165
<i>You stole that test</i>
<i>from Theta, right?</i>

09:59.265 --> 10:01.000
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Well, don't you think</i>

10:01.100 --> 10:02.835
<i>that the Honor Board would like</i>
<i>to know about the large scale</i>

10:02.935 --> 10:04.904
<i>cheating ring that's infecting</i>
<i>their beloved university?</i>

10:04.971 --> 10:07.640
<i>- You think I should tattle?</i>
<i>- Hell, yeah.</i>

10:07.740 --> 10:09.442
<i>It's them or you.</i>

10:11.444 --> 10:14.246
<i>- So Willow's going to pretend</i>
<i>to be straight?</i>

10:14.313 --> 10:16.082
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Yeah, that's not gonna work.</i>

10:16.148 --> 10:17.516
<i>- Hey, do any of you</i>
<i>want my outfit</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:18.918
<i>for the Anything But Clothes</i>
<i>party?</i>

10:18.985 --> 10:20.586
- <i>I'm not going.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

10:20.653 --> 10:22.321
<i>- Wait, you're not going</i>
<i>to the party with us?</i>

10:22.421 --> 10:24.423
<i>You made Whitney go</i>
<i>to the Caribbean Night party</i>

10:24.490 --> 10:26.826
- <i>when she had mono.</i>
<i>- I had fluid in my lungs.</i>

10:26.926 --> 10:28.527
<i>- Bela, you have to go.</i>
<i>We're all going.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:30.663
<i>I can't. My soul is crushed.</i>

10:30.763 --> 10:32.264
<i>My comedy dreams are over.</i>

10:32.331 --> 10:34.033
<i>I guess now I'll just have</i>
<i>to become a lame scientist</i>

10:34.133 --> 10:36.202
- <i>who cures IBS or some shit.</i>
<i>- You're fucking going!</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:38.871
<i>Dude, it's just a party.</i>

10:38.971 --> 10:40.806
<i>It's not.</i>

10:40.873 --> 10:42.675
<i>I'm going to steal the tests</i>
<i>from Theta's closet</i>

10:42.775 --> 10:44.543
<i>and turn them over</i>
<i>to the disciplinary committee.</i>

10:44.644 --> 10:46.178
<i>- Holy shit.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

10:46.278 --> 10:47.680
<i>White collar criminals</i>
<i>do this stuff all the time.</i>

10:47.780 --> 10:49.382
<i>- Having grown up</i>
<i>on the Upper East Side,</i>

10:49.482 --> 10:51.450
<i>I can confirm</i>
<i>that is absolutely true.</i>

10:51.517 --> 10:53.052
<i>Look, I'm just freaking out,</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:55.888
<i>and I really want</i>
<i>you guys to be there.</i>

10:55.988 --> 10:58.557
<i>- Well, all right, I'm in.</i>
<i>I can't miss this shit.</i>

10:58.658 --> 11:00.826
- <i>Let's go steal some test--</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

11:00.893 --> 11:02.161
<i>So which one of you guys</i>

11:02.228 --> 11:04.630
<i>wants to wrap this</i>
<i>around my ass?</i>

11:04.697 --> 11:06.332
<i>Nobody does. Stop.</i>

11:06.399 --> 11:07.800
<i>- She would love to do it.</i>
<i>- You know what? Stop.</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:18.577
<i>- The next thing I knew,</i>
<i>we were kissing in his truck.</i>

11:18.678 --> 11:21.414
<i>And not just kissing--</i>
<i>hand stuff, too.</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:23.916
<i>- Oh.</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:26.919
<i>You don't have to reveal</i>
<i>anymore than you want to.</i>

11:27.019 --> 11:31.157
<i>- No, I think it's important</i>
<i>that we all hear this.</i>

11:31.223 --> 11:32.491
- <i>He took my flower.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

11:32.558 --> 11:34.527
<i>Okay, this is getting</i>
<i>really personal.</i>

11:34.593 --> 11:35.828
<i>She's right.</i>

11:35.895 --> 11:37.229
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to overstep boundaries,</i>

11:37.329 --> 11:40.599
<i>but if you need anything,</i>
<i>you let me know.</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:43.602
<i>All I need is to heal,</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:44.937
<i>but I'm on my way.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:47.073
<i>Senator Chase, hi.</i>

11:47.173 --> 11:49.408
<i>Could I please</i>
<i>get a photo with you?</i>

11:49.508 --> 11:51.210
<i>Of course. Carl.</i>

11:51.277 --> 11:52.745
<i>That's your mom?</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:55.614
<i>- Take a photo of us.</i>
<i>Use that good angle.</i>

11:55.715 --> 11:57.216
<i>- He took your flower?</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

11:57.283 --> 12:00.052
<i>I'm deeply good at this.</i>
<i>Should I do drama?</i>

12:00.119 --> 12:01.854
<i>- You are shockingly</i>
<i>great at this,</i>

12:01.921 --> 12:03.289
<i>and I appreciate you doing it.</i>

12:03.389 --> 12:04.790
<i>Oh, I'm just getting started.</i>

12:04.890 --> 12:07.626
<i>When your mama come back,</i>
<i>I'ma make myself cry.</i>

12:09.295 --> 12:10.896
<i>- Cheers.</i>

12:10.963 --> 12:13.032
<i>Cheers, bitches.</i>

12:13.099 --> 12:15.935
<i>- Mm.</i>
<i>- Oh, Bela, what was that?</i>

12:16.035 --> 12:18.237
<i>- It was carrot cake Schnapps.</i>
<i>It was on clearance.</i>

12:18.304 --> 12:19.905
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>'cause it tastes like shit.</i>

12:19.972 --> 12:21.474
<i>- I kind of liked it.</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:23.576
<i>- I can't get the taste</i>
<i>out of my mouth.</i>

12:48.667 --> 12:50.069
<i>Let's do this.</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:02.181
<i>- Hell, yes, we're going</i>
<i>to see some side dick tonight.</i>

13:02.281 --> 13:03.983
<i>- I hope my mom</i>
<i>doesn't show up.</i>

13:04.083 --> 13:06.519
<i>- So she really bought that</i>
<i>Willow is hooking up with him?</i>

13:06.619 --> 13:07.853
<i>I almost believed it.</i>

13:07.953 --> 13:09.488
<i>Hello, bitches.</i>

13:09.588 --> 13:10.589
<i>- What?</i>

13:10.656 --> 13:12.858
<i>Lila, that outfit is awesome.</i>

13:12.958 --> 13:15.194
<i>- Thanks. It's 320 condoms</i>
<i>from the student center</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:16.996
<i>and I plan on using</i>
<i>all of them tonight.</i>

13:17.096 --> 13:19.198
<i>Starting with you.</i>
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

13:27.139 --> 13:29.708
<i>- Want to get two shots each?</i>
<i>Pretend they're for friends?</i>

13:29.809 --> 13:30.776
<i>Yes.</i>

13:30.843 --> 13:32.778
<i>- Four.</i>
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

13:32.845 --> 13:34.313
- <i>Uh, hi.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

13:34.380 --> 13:37.183
<i>- Uh, sorry</i>
<i>if this feels creepy.</i>

13:37.283 --> 13:40.152
<i>Um, but I've been</i>
<i>watching you all night.</i>

13:40.219 --> 13:42.154
<i>- I've been here</i>
<i>for, like, six minutes.</i>

13:42.221 --> 13:44.623
<i>- And those have been the best</i>
<i>six minutes of my life.</i>

13:44.690 --> 13:46.358
<i>Look, you're really charming</i>

13:46.458 --> 13:48.961
<i>and all of this</i>
<i>is very impressive.</i>

13:49.028 --> 13:51.030
<i>I'm just not</i>
<i>interested tonight.</i>

13:51.130 --> 13:52.164
<i>Fair enough.</i>

13:54.700 --> 13:56.068
<i>Girl, if you say no to that,</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:57.570
<i>what the hell</i>
<i>do you say yes to?</i>

13:58.904 --> 14:00.172
<i>- Whew, he had, like,</i>
<i>an eight pack.</i>

14:00.239 --> 14:01.307
<i>- Okay, all right.</i>
<i>- You know me.</i>

14:01.373 --> 14:03.142
- <i>The abs.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

14:03.209 --> 14:04.543
<i>Should we talk about</i>

14:04.643 --> 14:06.378
<i>your humiliating introduction</i>
<i>to my mom?</i>

14:06.478 --> 14:09.982
<i>- No, no, let's actually</i>
<i>never talk about that again.</i>

14:10.049 --> 14:11.317
<i>Actually, ever.</i>

14:11.383 --> 14:13.485
<i>- Yeah, she is way too much.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

14:13.552 --> 14:15.487
<i>- Doesn't seem like</i>
<i>too much to me.</i>

14:15.554 --> 14:17.656
<i>She left her book tour</i>
<i>to make sure you were okay.</i>

14:17.723 --> 14:20.192
<i>She obviously cares</i>
<i>about you a lot.</i>

14:23.329 --> 14:24.663
<i>Not to dampen the mood</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

14:24.730 --> 14:26.098
<i>- I--I know.</i>
<i>We're at a party.</i>

14:27.399 --> 14:29.201
<i>- Hey, Bela,</i>
<i>can we talk to you?</i>

14:29.268 --> 14:31.270
<i>Uh, yeah. Is everything okay?</i>

14:31.370 --> 14:32.905
<i>How was the rest</i>
<i>of "The Catullan" meeting?</i>

14:33.005 --> 14:35.274
<i>- It sort of ended</i>
<i>right after you left.</i>

14:35.374 --> 14:37.076
<i>So was everyone mad at me?</i>

14:37.176 --> 14:40.446
<i>- Actually, after you quit,</i>
<i>Jo and I started talking</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:43.449
- <i>and we quit too.</i>
<i>- Are you for real?</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:45.951
<i>- Yep, you were right.</i>
<i>That place is awful.</i>

14:46.051 --> 14:47.720
<i>I give it two weeks before</i>

14:47.786 --> 14:50.789
<i>Jeff has a nervous breakdown</i>
<i>and moves home to Connecticut.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.391
<i>- And how the fuck</i>
<i>did it take till now</i>

14:52.458 --> 14:54.059
<i>for them to have</i>
<i>a female editor?</i>

14:54.126 --> 14:56.528
<i>- Yeah, so that's what</i>
<i>we wanted to talk to you about.</i>

14:56.595 --> 14:59.265
<i>We wanted to start</i>
<i>a new comedy thing with you.</i>

14:59.365 --> 15:01.467
<i>- Ladies only.</i>
<i>- What do you think?</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:05.537
<i>Yes. Hell, yeah.</i>

15:05.604 --> 15:08.040
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

15:11.277 --> 15:12.645
<i>I kind of want to do it</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:14.313
<i>but I also don't want</i>
<i>to get in trouble.</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:15.648
<i>- Okay, if you want to do it,</i>
<i>you got to do it now.</i>

15:15.748 --> 15:17.549
<i>He's not looking.</i>
<i>He's distracted.</i>

15:17.616 --> 15:19.752
<i>- Okay, let's go.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

15:24.056 --> 15:25.925
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

15:31.463 --> 15:33.899
<i>Okay, hurry up.</i>
<i>It's a party.</i>

15:33.966 --> 15:35.501
<i>There's, like,</i>
<i>a million people around.</i>

15:35.601 --> 15:38.337
<i>- I've never done this before.</i>
<i>I'm not Tom Cruise.</i>

15:38.437 --> 15:39.505
- <i>Here they are.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:40.673
<i>Take it, let's go.</i>

15:42.241 --> 15:45.144
<i>Holy shit,</i>
<i>is that why you wore that bag?</i>

15:45.244 --> 15:46.679
<i>- Your girl knows</i>
<i>how to scheme.</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:48.013
<i>Okay.</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:50.482
<i>- Shit.</i>

15:50.582 --> 15:52.851
<i>- No, damn it, fuck.</i>
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

15:52.952 --> 15:54.687
<i>- What the fuck?</i>

15:57.022 --> 15:58.157
<i>What are you doing?</i>

15:58.257 --> 16:00.326
<i>What does it look like?</i>

16:01.327 --> 16:04.029
<i>- I'm going to leave</i>
<i>you both to it.</i>

16:07.666 --> 16:09.201
<i>- Are you doing this</i>
<i>'cause you're mad at me?</i>

16:09.301 --> 16:11.170
<i>- I got caught cheating</i>
<i>with one of these.</i>

16:11.270 --> 16:13.205
<i>For real?</i>

16:13.305 --> 16:15.541
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>
<i>- Yeah, it's not great.</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:19.378
<i>So I was gonna hand these in</i>
<i>and try and save myself.</i>

16:22.514 --> 16:23.782
<i>You should.</i>

16:23.849 --> 16:25.050
<i>Seriously?</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:26.652
<i>- I mean, if it helps you</i>
<i>not get expelled,</i>

16:26.719 --> 16:28.988
<i>then it's worth it.</i>

16:29.054 --> 16:30.289
<i>Thanks.</i>

16:33.492 --> 16:35.661
<i>I could also use</i>
<i>some duct tape.</i>

16:37.730 --> 16:40.065
<i>- So he just let you</i>
<i>take the test?</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:41.734
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- That's so cool.</i>

16:41.834 --> 16:44.370
<i>- Yeah, that is</i>
<i>surprisingly cool of him.</i>

16:44.470 --> 16:45.738
<i>Oh, my God, that's Eric.</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:47.406
<i>He really stood up</i>
<i>for me today.</i>

16:47.506 --> 16:49.408
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

16:49.508 --> 16:52.144
<i>Eric! Eric!</i>

16:52.211 --> 16:53.812
<i>- Bela?</i>
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

16:53.879 --> 16:55.581
<i>Oh, it's caution tape.</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.683
<i>Yeah, I can see that.</i>

16:57.750 --> 17:00.252
<i>- So how's it going?</i>
<i>- Bad.</i>

17:00.352 --> 17:01.987
<i>I had to irrevocably</i>
<i>end my relationship</i>

17:02.054 --> 17:04.590
<i>with my best friend,</i>
<i>and I have to move out</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:06.658
<i>of my apartment</i>
<i>because it's his.</i>

17:06.725 --> 17:08.027
<i>And we lost</i>
<i>all our good writers.</i>

17:08.093 --> 17:10.262
<i>So not the best day.</i>

17:10.362 --> 17:12.364
<i>Right, that makes sense.</i>

17:12.431 --> 17:14.066
- <i>Where are you gonna live?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

17:14.166 --> 17:15.401
<i>I could ask my dads</i>
<i>for rent money.</i>

17:15.501 --> 17:17.836
<i>- Dads?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I have two dads.</i>

17:17.903 --> 17:19.204
<i>Oh, that's fun.</i>

17:19.271 --> 17:20.439
<i>- You think it's fun</i>
<i>that I have two dads?</i>

17:20.539 --> 17:22.040
<i>- I do.</i>

17:22.107 --> 17:24.109
<i>Yeah, I guess it's kind of fun.</i>

17:24.209 --> 17:25.944
<i>- Well, I should go.</i>
<i>My friends are waiting for me.</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:27.513
<i>But, um,</i>
<i>maybe I'll see you around?</i>

17:27.579 --> 17:29.214
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

17:30.949 --> 17:33.886
<i>- Damn,</i>
<i>I'm freezing my ass off!</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:50.135
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

17:50.235 --> 17:54.306
<i>- I'm sorry to show up</i>
<i>unannounced.</i>

17:54.406 --> 17:55.607
<i>Uh, can I come in?</i>

17:55.707 --> 17:57.743
<i>- I don't think</i>
<i>that's a good idea.</i>

17:57.810 --> 17:59.645
<i>Why?</i>

17:59.745 --> 18:01.480
- <i>Someone else here?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

18:01.580 --> 18:03.816
<i>I just don't think</i>
<i>it's a good idea.</i>

18:03.916 --> 18:05.317
<i>Okay.</i>

18:07.886 --> 18:10.656
<i>Well, uh, I just...</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:13.792
<i>I came to say that I, uh...</i>

18:16.061 --> 18:18.230
<i>That I really miss you.</i>

18:18.297 --> 18:19.731
<i>And this is where</i>
<i>it would be great</i>

18:19.798 --> 18:22.568
<i>if you could say that</i>
<i>you also miss me too.</i>

18:22.634 --> 18:24.770
<i>I do miss you, but, um,</i>

18:24.837 --> 18:26.271
<i>I also want to move on.</i>

18:26.338 --> 18:28.240
<i>And like I said,</i>
<i>I don't want to go backwards.</i>

18:28.307 --> 18:30.075
<i>I can't, so...</i>

18:30.142 --> 18:31.777
<i>you need to move on too.</i>

18:57.336 --> 18:58.704
<i>I prepared a statement.</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:00.973
- <i>It's--it's kind of long.</i>
<i>- It's okay.</i>

19:01.039 --> 19:03.809
<i>Kimberly, let's just start</i>
<i>with some questions.</i>

19:03.876 --> 19:05.477
<i>Oh.</i>

19:05.544 --> 19:08.313
<i>- Is it true that you cheated</i>
<i>on Professor Bennett's midterm?</i>

19:08.380 --> 19:10.315
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- And was Professor Bennett</i>

19:10.382 --> 19:12.050
<i>clear about what materials were</i>

19:12.151 --> 19:13.685
<i>and were not allowed</i>
<i>during the test?</i>

19:13.785 --> 19:15.220
<i>Yes.</i>

19:15.320 --> 19:17.022
<i>- So did you know that</i>
<i>what you were doing was wrong?</i>

19:17.122 --> 19:18.657
<i>Yes.</i>

19:18.724 --> 19:21.226
<i>Boy, I don't like how these</i>
<i>questions are making me look.</i>

19:21.326 --> 19:22.694
<i>Well, what you're describing</i>

19:22.794 --> 19:25.898
<i>is a clear violation</i>
<i>of Essex honor code.</i>

19:25.998 --> 19:27.666
<i>We take that very seriously.</i>

19:27.733 --> 19:30.302
<i>I know. I messed up.</i>

19:30.369 --> 19:31.737
<i>But this isn't me.</i>

19:31.837 --> 19:34.907
<i>I've never been in trouble</i>
<i>in my life before.</i>

19:35.007 --> 19:37.209
<i>But I'm just kind of</i>
<i>struggling here.</i>

19:37.309 --> 19:39.878
<i>The classes are amazing,</i>
<i>but they're hard.</i>

19:39.978 --> 19:41.313
<i>At least I think so.</i>

19:41.380 --> 19:44.750
<i>And I want to do well,</i>
<i>but I also work</i>

19:44.850 --> 19:47.686
<i>five days a week just so that</i>
<i>I can afford to go here.</i>

19:47.753 --> 19:50.255
<i>And I don't mean</i>
<i>to make excuses</i>

19:50.355 --> 19:53.825
<i>or complain about being poor,</i>
<i>but you have no idea</i>

19:53.892 --> 19:55.994
<i>how hard it was for my family</i>
<i>to send me here.</i>

19:56.061 --> 19:59.097
<i>My mom had to sell her piano,</i>
<i>and that really sucked.</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:03.702
<i>And that's fine,</i>
<i>it's fine, I'm fine.</i>

20:03.769 --> 20:06.205
<i>It's who we are.</i>

20:06.271 --> 20:10.509
<i>But I guess that's why I feel</i>
<i>so much pressure to do well.</i>

20:10.576 --> 20:13.445
<i>I know what I did is wrong</i>
<i>and I won't do it again,</i>

20:13.545 --> 20:16.248
<i>but my spot at Essex</i>
<i>means everything to me.</i>

20:16.348 --> 20:18.417
<i>I can't lose it.</i>

20:18.517 --> 20:21.720
<i>I should've ended with the</i>
<i>"I won't do this again" thing.</i>

20:21.787 --> 20:23.956
<i>I won't do this again.</i>

20:27.526 --> 20:30.629
<i>- Okay, thank you</i>
<i>for your statement.</i>

20:32.197 --> 20:34.299
<i>- Is there anything else</i>
<i>you'd like to share?</i>

20:34.399 --> 20:36.401
<i>Actually, yes.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:56.822
<i>Baby, I want to apologize.</i>

20:56.922 --> 21:00.392
<i>I saw that article and</i>
<i>I assumed the worst of you.</i>

21:00.459 --> 21:02.160
<i>It's okay, Mom.</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:04.162
<i>No, it's not okay.</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:06.765
<i>I get scrutinized so much</i>
<i>in my line of work.</i>

21:06.832 --> 21:08.834
<i>If I show half an inch</i>
<i>of cleavage,</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.902
<i>I am a headline</i>
<i>on "Bride Bark."</i>

21:10.969 --> 21:12.904
<i>And it makes me</i>
<i>so much stricter on you,</i>

21:12.971 --> 21:15.140
<i>which is unfair.</i>

21:15.240 --> 21:17.509
<i>You shouldn't have</i>
<i>to pay the price for my career.</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:19.778
- <i>You are a good kid--</i>
<i>- I did it.</i>

21:19.845 --> 21:21.013
<i>It was me.</i>

21:21.113 --> 21:23.315
<i>I was the girl.</i>

21:24.683 --> 21:25.851
<i>Which girl?</i>

21:27.819 --> 21:30.656
<i>- The one who had the affair</i>
<i>with the coach.</i>

21:30.756 --> 21:32.658
<i>Willow was</i>
<i>just pretending for me.</i>

21:32.758 --> 21:34.159
- <i>She's gay.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

21:34.259 --> 21:35.694
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>She was very convincing.</i>

21:35.794 --> 21:37.629
<i>- You know that's not</i>
<i>what I was talking about.</i>

21:37.696 --> 21:39.765
<i>You had an...</i>

21:40.766 --> 21:43.635
<i>You had an affair</i>
<i>with your soccer coach?</i>

21:43.702 --> 21:45.203
<i>How could you</i>
<i>have kept this from me</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:46.772
<i>and lied to me about it?</i>

21:46.838 --> 21:48.173
<i>- I knew it was wrong,</i>
<i>but I was in love with him.</i>

21:48.273 --> 21:51.276
<i>I am so upset.</i>

21:51.343 --> 21:53.445
<i>I know you're angry with me.</i>

21:53.512 --> 21:55.213
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:55.314 --> 21:58.016
- <i>I never meant to--</i>
<i>- I'm not angry with you.</i>

21:58.116 --> 21:59.384
<i>I'm angry with myself.</i>

21:59.484 --> 22:01.019
<i>- Mom, I didn't want</i>
<i>to disappoint you.</i>

22:01.119 --> 22:03.055
<i>- How could I have</i>
<i>let this happen?</i>

22:03.155 --> 22:05.724
<i>I'm your mother.</i>
<i>I'm supposed to protect you.</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:09.661
<i>Instead, I made you feel like</i>
<i>you had to keep this a secret.</i>

22:09.728 --> 22:11.296
<i>I just...</i>

22:11.363 --> 22:13.865
<i>I mean, I thought</i>
<i>I could handle it by myself.</i>

22:13.965 --> 22:18.303
<i>- Baby, you don't only have</i>
<i>to tell me the good things.</i>

22:18.370 --> 22:22.240
<i>I'm also here</i>
<i>when things are bad.</i>

22:22.341 --> 22:26.745
<i>Especially when things are bad.</i>

22:36.555 --> 22:39.491
<i>- Listen, I don't have</i>
<i>to leave for a while.</i>

22:39.558 --> 22:44.663
<i>Would you like to come back</i>
<i>to my hotel and talk some more?</i>

22:44.730 --> 22:47.866
<i>- Yeah, that sounds good.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

22:49.868 --> 22:52.437
<i>So you trying to tell me</i>
<i>your friend Willow is gay?</i>

22:52.537 --> 22:56.108
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>She's an amazing actress.</i>

22:56.208 --> 22:57.609
<i>- How did</i>
<i>the disciplinary hearing go?</i>

22:57.709 --> 22:59.177
<i>Did you cry?</i>

22:59.244 --> 23:01.680
<i>- I cried a little,</i>
<i>and then a lot on my way home.</i>

23:01.747 --> 23:04.216
<i>Kimberly.</i>

23:04.282 --> 23:06.284
<i>You gave them</i>
<i>the tests though, right?</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:07.519
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:09.054 --> 23:11.390
<i>- I think that</i>
<i>it's gonna be fine.</i>

23:11.456 --> 23:13.792
<i>If seasons 1 through 22 of</i>
<i>"SVU" have taught me anything,</i>

23:13.892 --> 23:15.293
<i>is that Chris Maloney</i>
<i>can get it</i>

23:15.394 --> 23:17.929
<i>and that turning over</i>
<i>evidence always works.</i>

23:18.029 --> 23:20.732
<i>- I hope so.</i>
<i>- Me too.</i>

23:20.799 --> 23:23.869
<i>All right, I'm gonna go meet up</i>
<i>with Evangeline and Jo.</i>

23:23.935 --> 23:25.570
<i>Okay, where are the others?</i>

23:25.637 --> 23:26.805
<i>Uh, Whitney's out and</i>

23:26.905 --> 23:28.306
<i>I think Leighton's</i>
<i>still in bed?</i>

23:28.407 --> 23:29.941
<i>- Leighton's still in bed?</i>
<i>It's almost noon.</i>

23:30.041 --> 23:31.076
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:38.583 --> 23:41.119
<i>- Leighton.</i>
<i>- Go away please.</i>

23:42.287 --> 23:43.755
<i>Are you crying?</i>

23:43.822 --> 23:45.323
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:47.058
<i>- What's going on?</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:51.830
<i>- I was seeing someone</i>
<i>and I fucked it up.</i>

23:51.930 --> 23:54.800
<i>I fucked it up</i>
<i>because I am fucked up.</i>

23:54.900 --> 23:57.903
<i>- I didn't even know</i>
<i>you were seeing someone.</i>

23:59.471 --> 24:01.640
<i>But you're not fucked up.</i>

24:01.740 --> 24:03.175
<i>You're like,</i>

24:03.275 --> 24:05.744
<i>the most together person</i>
<i>I know.</i>

24:06.978 --> 24:10.182
<i>You're so pretty</i>
<i>and you're so smart.</i>

24:10.282 --> 24:12.250
<i>And if this guy's too stupid</i>
<i>to see that,</i>

24:12.317 --> 24:14.286
<i>then it's his loss.</i>

24:15.687 --> 24:17.189
<i>Okay?</i>

24:18.623 --> 24:21.626
<i>Don't cry.</i>
<i>He's not worth it.</i>

24:22.961 --> 24:25.597
<i>- It wasn't a guy.</i>
<i>It was a girl.</i>

24:25.664 --> 24:27.799
<i>I'm gay.</i>

24:29.534 --> 24:32.304
<i>Oh, Leighton.</i>

24:36.975 --> 24:39.878
<i>Does anyone else know?</i>

24:39.978 --> 24:41.313
<i>No.</i>

24:43.148 --> 24:46.017
<i>- Wow, I'm surprised</i>
<i>you're telling me.</i>

24:46.117 --> 24:49.654
<i>Yeah, well, me too.</i>

24:49.721 --> 24:52.390
<i>I'm really proud of you.</i>

24:52.491 --> 24:54.159
<i>I don't want to be like this.</i>

24:54.226 --> 24:57.062
<i>Kimberly, it's terrifying.</i>

24:57.162 --> 25:00.899
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>my whole life to change.</i>

25:00.999 --> 25:04.402
<i>- I get it.</i>
<i>Coming out seems really scary.</i>

25:06.972 --> 25:09.074
<i>But I think...</i>

25:09.174 --> 25:15.080
<i>the only way you can be happy</i>
<i>is if you're yourself.</i>

25:29.261 --> 25:32.197
<i>You are a really good person.</i>

25:32.264 --> 25:35.233
<i>So are you.</i>

25:35.333 --> 25:37.002
<i>You're not just telling me this</i>

25:37.068 --> 25:39.437
<i>because there's a chance I</i>
<i>might get expelled soon, right?</i>

25:39.538 --> 25:41.706
<i>- No, at least not on any level</i>
<i>that I realize.</i>

25:41.773 --> 25:43.708
<i>- Okay.</i>

25:52.117 --> 25:53.518
<i>- Remember that</i>
<i>thick-necked hottie</i>

25:53.585 --> 25:55.186
<i>that hit on Leighton</i>
<i>last night?</i>

25:55.253 --> 25:56.922
<i>Well, I am three years deep</i>
<i>into his Insta</i>

25:57.022 --> 25:59.858
<i>and I just found this.</i>

25:59.925 --> 26:01.426
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

26:01.526 --> 26:04.596
<i>Leighton, you got to ride</i>
<i>this dude like a log flume.</i>

26:04.696 --> 26:06.698
<i>- I think Leighton</i>
<i>can do better.</i>

26:06.765 --> 26:07.966
<i>Do better?</i>

26:08.066 --> 26:10.569
- <i>Look at his V muscles.</i>
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

26:10.635 --> 26:12.404
<i>The email from the Honor Board</i>
<i>came in.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:17.576
<i>What does it say?</i>

26:17.642 --> 26:18.643
<i>I'm not expelled.</i>

26:18.743 --> 26:20.812
<i>- Yes!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

26:20.912 --> 26:23.248
- <i>That's great.</i>
<i>- Scared me.</i>

26:24.783 --> 26:28.486
<i>- Hey, what is wrong?</i>
<i>Why aren't you happy?</i>

26:28.587 --> 26:30.822
<i>They revoked my scholarship.</i>

26:32.390 --> 26:37.662
<i>So I have to find an extra</i>
<i>$23,000 a semester.</i>

28:01.513 --> 28:02.580
<i>Go to bed.</i>
