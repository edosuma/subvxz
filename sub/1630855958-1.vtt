Once upon a time,

He lived with his grandfather
in a cottage,

surrounded by a high stone wall.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.229
Outside the wall,
there was a meadow,

01:45.271 --> 01:48.400
with a pond and a tall tree.

01:48.441 --> 01:53.988
Beyond the meadow
was a deep, dark forest.

He'd seen something

the gate had been left open,

as there was a deep pond

the bird flew down

who was very sweet, said,

"What kind of a bird are you

Just then,
something caught Peter's eye.

10:10.985 --> 10:14.781
Pussy was stalking
through the tall grass.

foolishly jumped out
of the pond.

into the tree.

"Be a good little birdie.
