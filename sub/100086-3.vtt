00:01.569 --> 00:04.572
Back in the day,
my mom always invaded
my personal space.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.575
She was famous for her
snuggies, huggies, kissies,

00:07.608 --> 00:09.177
and her signature move,

00:09.210 --> 00:10.811
the nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-
nom-nom-nom-nom.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.781
Good morning!
Here's your nom!

00:13.814 --> 00:15.149
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom!

00:15.183 --> 00:16.417
Eh, right!

00:16.450 --> 00:19.120
Like the movie
Good Morning, Vietnam,
except people liked that.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.454
That Mork is so talented.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.790
I wish he'd make
a Vietnam Part Two.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.292
Going in for another scoop.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.360
Nom-nom-nom-nom-
nom-nom-nom-nom!

00:26.394 --> 00:27.828
Enough!
This has to stop!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.197
I'm cutting you off cold turkey!

00:29.230 --> 00:31.199
What? At least
let me taper off.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.301
This mama's gotta nom-ma.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.635
Nom-nom-nom...
I mean it!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.137
This is your last nom.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.505
I had stopped my mom cold,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.373
but when life closes one door,

00:39.407 --> 00:41.309
my mom crashes through another.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.043
Oh, look
who sent you
a brochure.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.845
Calgary State Bible College.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.214
Sounds cold and religious.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.981
Oh, you're not going
to this garbage school.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.451
But remember
when you were
blabbing about

00:50.484 --> 00:53.854
adult-y adventures
and viciously cutting me
out of your life?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.456
Sounds like for sure you do.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.126
Well, this means
that your college
phase is here,

00:58.159 --> 01:00.694
and you're gonna
need your mama
to help get you in.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.631
Or I just say yes
to these religious Eskimos
and we're good to go.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.065
No, silly.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.667
I'm gonna be on you
night and day

01:06.700 --> 01:09.370
to make sure you get into
the best college there is.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.804
Night? Day?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.473
But those are all the times.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.642
My mom
was determined
to use college

01:14.675 --> 01:17.145
as a way to get
close to me.
Way too close.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.213
Quick! What's the
square root of 144?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.581
Naked body! Scared!

01:20.614 --> 01:22.726
College admissions boards
won't be as forgiving
as I am, Adam.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.685
Mom, please!
This is humiliating!

01:24.718 --> 01:27.588
Humiliating? Try telling
your friends your kid
got deferred at Tufts.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.722
Gah!

01:28.756 --> 01:32.059
Ta-da!
It's your college collage
to put above your bed

01:32.092 --> 01:35.329
so you can look at it
before you go to sleep
and dream about college.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.530
Yeah, I'll never do that.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.932
But is that my head glued onto
a dude playing Frisbee?

01:38.966 --> 01:41.535
It is.
This is the energy
I can expect from you

01:41.569 --> 01:42.779
until I actually
get into college?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.705
I'm super excited, too!

01:44.738 --> 01:48.209
Oh, this is gonna be
such a fun journey,
study buddy.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.743
Mwah!
Mm!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.512
I gotta get my mom off my back.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.358
Well, you could help her
find a hobby to distract her.
Maybe a bowling league?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.526
My mom's currently
in a legal matter with
Jenkintown Lanes,

01:56.550 --> 01:57.627
and that's all
I'm allowed to say.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.119
She could try my mom's hobby,

01:59.153 --> 02:01.555
drinking boxed wine
while she completely
ignores me.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.591
Wow.
You're so lucky.
Totally.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.393
Look, I'm sure
this will blow over soon.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.894
Erica and Barry just moved out.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.628
Your mom just
needs time to adjust.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.963
Yeah, you're probably right.

and while Erica was
focused on doing college
right this time,

02:51.939 --> 02:53.641
Geoff wasn't focused
on anything at all.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
So, I have an hour
until my next class,

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
which I can use
to finish my chem lab

02:57.645 --> 02:59.647
and my reading for women's lit.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.914
How's your day looking?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.428
Eh, I gotta get this ball
in this cup.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
Oh. Well, my schedule
just opened up.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.596
Can I make you another tea?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.522
I think I'm good.
Cool, cool.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.824
Well, I'll just sit quietly,
and I'm here if you need me.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.668
♪♪

03:26.474 --> 03:27.984
You know, I'm just gonna
make you a backup tea.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.644
No. Geoff,
I think it's great

03:30.678 --> 03:32.322
that you're taking a year off
to find yourself,

03:32.346 --> 03:33.681
but I've got work to do.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.948
I knew it!
I'm bothering you!

03:34.982 --> 03:36.650
No!

03:36.684 --> 03:38.286
But for the love of God, yes!

03:38.319 --> 03:39.820
I really thought
all this free time

03:39.853 --> 03:43.291
would finally help me relax
after a very intense 18 years,

03:43.324 --> 03:44.534
but I've never been
more stressed.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.693
I'm growing so much hair!

03:45.726 --> 03:46.803
Stress makes you lose hair.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.895
Oh, no!
Nothing is right!

03:47.928 --> 03:50.498
Don't worry. I know
exactly how to fix this.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.965
Is this your card?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.734
No.
Yes, it is!

03:53.767 --> 03:54.868
You liar!

03:54.902 --> 03:56.203
- JTP?
- JTP.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.405
Geoff's broken.
Fix him.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.015
- Thanks, hon. Love you.
- Oh, she's gone.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.550
Broken, huh?
What are we talking about?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.710
Mental? Emotional?
Physical?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.654
Pop off your shirt
so we can see what
we're working with.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.046
No, it's not body-related.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.181
I just need to figure out
a way to fill my days

04:08.215 --> 04:09.650
and quiet my shrieking mind.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.385
Lucky for you,
your lazy girlfriend

04:11.419 --> 04:12.986
dumped you
on the right friend group.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.154
Now pop off your shirt.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.227
Stop trying to undress me.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.358
I got it.
Come work with me
at The Gap.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.560
I get 25% off all cargo shorts.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.495
These are the same ones
Queen Latifah wears.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.939
Or you could work
for my Uncle Ronnie.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.898
Yeah, he puts a box in my trunk,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.600
I drive it
across the Canadian border,

04:26.634 --> 04:29.537
and then wham, bam,
all the Hardee's I can eat.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.505
Yeah, bro. I think
you might be a drug mule.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.707
What if I don't want
to be Queen Latifah
or a criminal?

04:33.741 --> 04:37.010
Done! You will start your own
insanely lucrative business.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.912
That's better!
I use businesses
all the time.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.080
I think I'm in real trouble.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.616
Last week, I accidentally
went to economics class,

04:42.650 --> 04:43.784
and now I know everything

04:43.817 --> 04:45.386
about starting your own business

04:45.419 --> 04:47.721
using the laws
of supply and da man.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.798
I'm pretty sure
it's "demand."

04:48.822 --> 04:50.223
Wrong, Geoffrey.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.960
It's when you ask
da man what he wants
and then you supply it.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.562
Dad, what do you want?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.196
To watch Cheers in peace.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.264
Dad!

04:57.297 --> 04:58.466
Uh...
Sandwich from Lee's.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.767
Boring!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.101
We'll ask another da man.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.270
Hang on.
T-That's a good idea.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.806
W-Why are pizza places
the only ones that deliver?

05:05.839 --> 05:08.809
What if there was a business
that would deliver
any food to your house?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.210
Like live Maine lobsters?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.112
Beef Wellington
with a port wine reduction!

05:12.145 --> 05:15.549
Or pizza from
fancy pizza places
that don't deliver.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.617
All of it.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.051
You call me, I place the order,

05:18.085 --> 05:20.253
pick it up, bring it to you,
all for a small fee.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.289
I can get
an outside-the-house
sandwich

05:22.322 --> 05:24.758
while staying
inside the house?
Sandwich me.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.093
I have my first customer.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.895
W-Wait. I think
I just started a business.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.739
You need drivers?
I'm looking for
a little extra cash.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.599
Me too.
I-I hate these shorts.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.601
And I might be
a drug mule,
so I am in.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.668
I have employees!

05:34.702 --> 05:38.138
And a president/ CEO/visionary.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.008
Salary TBD, but likely TB a lot.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.643
First thought, we need a name.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.478
How 'bout "Food in a Geoffy"?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.946
Not poppin'.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.492
How about "Barry Up
and Get Your Food in a Geoffy:
A Big Tasty Biz"?

05:48.516 --> 05:49.583
It's definitely longer.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.184
Agreed.
I'll order T-shirts.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.853
While Geoff was finding
his calling,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.823
I was finding myself totally
lost in history class.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.434
Here are your assignments
for your papers.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.826
Dave Kim... Harriet Tubman.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.461
Sweet! H-Tub.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.431
Nothing's gonna
be underground about her
when I'm done with my paper.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.998
I weep for our future.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.634
New girl...
Susan B. Anthony.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.001
Well, I be excited.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.102
Nice.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.171
Adam Goldberg...
Sandra Day O'Connor.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.372
Oh, no, thank you.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.007
"No, thank you"?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.976
This should be enraging.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.244
Say your dumb words.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.713
As you know,
Mr. Coleman agreed
that I'm a visual learner

06:19.747 --> 06:21.214
and always let me make a video.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.816
As you know,
Mr. Coleman was fired

06:22.850 --> 06:24.518
for tying a quarter to a string

06:24.552 --> 06:26.620
and stealing Rolos
from the vending machines.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.389
Paper it is. I believe
you said it would be
on George Lucas?

06:29.423 --> 06:31.892
1,000 words
on Sandra Day O'Connor.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.062
How about Sarah Connor,
the character from Terminator?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.530
Which is directed
by James Cameron,

06:36.564 --> 06:37.965
which is
who my paper will be on.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.833
Sandra... Day... O'Connor!

06:39.867 --> 06:42.369
You know what?
Everybody just sit quietly
while I snap chalk!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.537
You're boned, bro.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.211
You haven't
written a paper
in three years.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.374
Maybe I still don't have to.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.009
There's my special lady.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.077
Wait, what?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.588
I was thinking about us
being study buddies.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.680
Let's do that.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.023
Are you toying
with my heart
right now?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.324
Because it will
literally explode!

06:55.348 --> 06:56.584
No toying.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.820
Just a boy looking to do
some scholastic bonding
with his mama.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.689
Where should we start?
Oh, I know!

07:01.722 --> 07:04.558
I have to write a paper
on one Sandra Day O'Connor.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.093
And you immediately
thought of me?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.328
Well, you were
almost a cookbook author,

07:08.361 --> 07:09.830
and you almost
coulda been a lawyer.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.699
I was almost
both of those things.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.933
So, let's get on it, girl!

07:12.966 --> 07:14.535
We'll make a whole
Sandra Day of it.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.605
Yay! My sweet little baby
has re-latched to my bosom.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.872
You have a way with words.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.508
So let's start
writing that paper

07:20.541 --> 07:21.909
without those ones specifically.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.210
I'll bring the typewriter,

07:23.243 --> 07:25.713
you bring the dimples,
study buddy.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.214
Study buddies!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.458
I know what you're doing, kiddo.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.917
I'm not doing anything.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.386
You're conning your mother
into writing a paper for you.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.055
Oh.
Yeah, I'm doing that.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.123
But it's fine.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.725
She wants to spend time
with her son,

07:37.758 --> 07:39.960
and I want
not to write a paper.
It's win-win.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.195
The honorable
Sandra Day O'Connor

07:42.229 --> 07:44.965
would be appalled
that you would
even consider this.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.366
You seem to know
a lot about her.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.411
Why don't you stick around
and help your daughter
write her paper?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.370
Eh, you're all ferkokte.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.072
I deserve a pickle.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.775
Hey, Schmooey,
you're just my type.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.045
Typewriter humor.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.813
Just save that gold
for the page.

07:59.847 --> 08:00.948
So, where do we start?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.283
Here's everything
I know so far...
She's a lady.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.285
Well, I know a ton.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.754
For her confirmation hearing,

08:06.787 --> 08:09.089
she wore the
most hideous purple coat.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.834
You're an expert.
Let me get out of your way.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.827
I wish this essay
was a million words.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.630
Should we do that?
Just write a million words?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.732
Definitely. But no.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.801
With that, my mom got cracking.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.302
Sure, it wasn't a million words,

08:22.335 --> 08:26.073
but it was
an endless amount of detail
on Sandra Day O'Connor.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.909
All I had to do was sit back
and enjoy the ride.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.611
Yes!
Writing is easy!

08:30.644 --> 08:32.511
While I was
outsourcing my paper,

08:32.546 --> 08:35.683
Geoff's new business
was already a source
of great stress.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.417
- Food in a Geoffy.
- Please hold.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.753
- Food in a Geoffy.
- Please hold.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.655
Food in a Geoffy.
How may I help you?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.866
What do you mean you
only got three loose
fries with your order?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.859
That's on me.
I'm a snacker when I drive.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.662
Me too. But who's gonna
actually check the exact
length of a footlong?

08:48.696 --> 08:49.963
Guys, stop eating the food!

08:49.997 --> 08:51.464
Does that apply to beverages?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.610
'Cause there used to
be two shakes,
and now there are none.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.636
Damn it, JTP.
Just go! Deliver!

08:55.669 --> 08:56.937
JTP!
JTP.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.471
Big news, Geoffrey.

08:58.505 --> 09:02.542
I'm using company funds
to buy an expensive putter
for my putting green.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.177
This one keeps missing the hole.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.046
Barry, do you really need
all that stuff?

09:06.079 --> 09:09.316
You need to spend money
to make money.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.019
Sometimes I question
your commitment
to my business.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.687
It's my business!
What business?

09:13.721 --> 09:14.822
Great news, Erica.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.999
I found a better way to relax

09:16.023 --> 09:17.233
than hanging around
your dorm room.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.526
I started a relentless,
high-octane
food-delivery company.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.262
Food in a Geoffy!
Please hold!

09:22.295 --> 09:23.396
Wait, what is it?

09:23.430 --> 09:24.641
Well, it's extremely
simple, really.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.699
Except it wasn't.

09:25.733 --> 09:26.800
Say you want a burger.

09:26.834 --> 09:27.968
You just page my beeper,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.378
I get the page
and then call you back
wherever I am.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.214
You place your order with me,
and then I call the restaurant

09:31.238 --> 09:32.381
and place that order with them.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.708
Then, I or one of
my many unreliable drivers

09:34.742 --> 09:37.220
get your order,
and we drive it to you
for a small delivery fee.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.546
Then it starts all over again
and again and again.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.657
I haven't slept in two days.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.850
$2 for all that work?
Pretty cool, huh?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.193
Geoff, are you sure
this is worth...

09:44.217 --> 09:46.053
Damn it.
Food in a Geoffy.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.621
Hello?
Mr. Goldberg?

09:47.655 --> 09:51.925
Yeah, I'll have a Shasta,
light ice, from the kitchen,
a chili dog from the Wawa,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.526
and take Lucky for a tinkle.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.728
We don't provide dog care.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.830
The customer is always right.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.732
On it.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.869
I'm so happy
your gentle annoyance with me
pushed me into this.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.337
While Food in a Geoffy
took over Geoffy's life,

10:04.371 --> 10:07.574
my mom-written paper
would surely save mine.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.676
Meh!

10:08.709 --> 10:10.410
A C?
What the hell, man?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.046
Yeah, just like your haircut,
super mediocre.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.181
But this makes no sense.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.716
Believe me, that C on your paper

10:15.749 --> 10:17.350
is the only thing
that was accurate.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.119
You referred to Justice O'Connor

10:19.152 --> 10:22.155
as Sandy, Sally, Shawna, Shonda,

10:22.189 --> 10:23.556
and one time, Tiffany!

10:23.590 --> 10:25.058
Wow. Yeah.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.928
Seems like the most
cursory once-over
would've caught that.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.498
Aloha, my little academia nut.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.400
Hi, Mom.
Quick question...

10:33.433 --> 10:34.868
Are you a damn fool?

10:34.902 --> 10:37.137
A C?
Yeah, for "crap."

10:37.170 --> 10:39.072
If I wanted a C,
I would have
written it myself.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.373
This is not okay!

10:40.407 --> 10:41.809
Neither is your spelling
or grammar

10:41.842 --> 10:43.076
or rambling sentences.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.913
And who the hell
is Tiffany Night O'Brien?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.380
Oh, they knew who I meant.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.615
I don't know who you meant,

10:48.648 --> 10:49.826
and I was sitting right there.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.318
Well, I'm gonna fix this.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.220
Your college future is at stake.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.088
First thing tomorrow,
I'm marching down

10:55.122 --> 10:56.556
to have a talk
with Mr. Woodburn.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.125
Oh, please don't do that.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.292
It's done.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.795
Study buddies
take care of each other.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.930
Study buddies!

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
Study buddies.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.400
I guess we're both
pretty deep into a pickle.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.770
♪♪

11:12.806 --> 11:14.775
Erica was worried
that Food in a Geoffy

11:14.808 --> 11:16.476
was leading Geoff
to a nervous breakdown,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.746
so she was going to help him
relax with a movie.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.513
See?
Isn't this nice?

11:20.547 --> 11:23.283
Just you and me
and the stress-free
corpse comedy

11:23.316 --> 11:24.517
of Weekend at Bernie's.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.186
Babe, I appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.788
Honest.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.922
Oh, no!
Who is this for?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.533
I never got the order,
and now it's gonna be late!

11:30.557 --> 11:32.025
Geoff, the popcorn is for you.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.594
Oh, right. I forgot
sometimes I eat food, too.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.030
Geoff! Geoff! Geoff?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.032
Sorry. You have
the same fat head as Geoff.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.902
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm looking for a man
named Geoff!

11:41.935 --> 11:43.003
Barry, be quiet!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.704
There you are!
Why are you here?

11:44.738 --> 11:46.273
And why are you wearing a suit?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.707
In no particular order...

11:47.741 --> 11:50.944
I'm a high-powered CEO,
and the worst has happened.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.980
Customer Murray Goldberg
got the wrong order.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
He's freaking out
and wants you to fix it.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.316
Oh, no.
Oh, yes!

11:56.349 --> 11:58.385
I even considered
handling it myself,

11:58.418 --> 12:00.120
but I came here
'cause it was easier.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.254
Well, tough luck.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.857
We're on a date,
so let the other
JTP dopes do it.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.559
I'm sorry, Erica.
I have to fix this.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.297
People think he's alive,
but he's dead.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.201
As Geoff
abandoned Erica
to put out a fire,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.136
my mom was at school
starting one.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.738
Thank you
for meeting with us.
I'll make this quick.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.640
Are you a stupid idiot?

12:20.673 --> 12:21.708
Mom!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.910
Whoa! Coming in hot.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.145
I think what my mom
is trying to say

12:25.178 --> 12:28.081
is maybe my paper deserves
a slightly higher grade.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.516
No "maybe" about it!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.684
Mrs. Goldberg,
this paper is filled

12:31.718 --> 12:33.453
with typos and run-on sentences.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.756
So? It's also light and fun,
like a summer beach read.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.491
Oh, I laughed a lot.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.828
Mostly at how your son
and his childlike mind

12:40.861 --> 12:42.429
are going to exist in society.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.531
Well, I, for one,
appreciate that concern.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.033
Thank you for your time.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.267
Not to mention,
Mrs. Goldberg,

12:47.300 --> 12:50.670
it is riddled with
historical inaccuracies.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.606
Well, I'm sorry I didn't
have time to go to the library

12:53.640 --> 12:56.043
and wrestle a vagrant
for the microfiche.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.078
Why would you go to the library?

12:58.111 --> 13:01.281
Because I am
helping Adam...
A little.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.283
Full disclosure,
we're study buddies.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.853
It's mostly just snacks
and moral support.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.096
It's clear
what's happening here,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.922
so I am gonna change this grade.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.324
Finally. An A-minus
and we're out of here.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.393
It's an F for cheating.

13:13.426 --> 13:18.398
Well, I give you an F
for "failure as an educator,"

13:18.431 --> 13:20.300
and I am taking this
to Principal Ball.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.069
Don't worry, Adam.
Mama's got this.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.170
But she didn't.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.938
Adam's suspended for two weeks.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.106
Balls!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.875
This is
a terrifyingly bad paper,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.576
especially from an adult.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.278
Unacceptable, Earl.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.146
Don't take it out on Adam
just 'cause you need

13:33.180 --> 13:36.449
to stand by your motley crew
of burnouts and sad sacks!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.651
Oh, no.
You called me what I am.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.253
Principal Ball, please!

13:40.287 --> 13:42.489
Two weeks at home?
Just the two of us?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.457
The time does not fit the crime!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.493
I suppose
there is another option.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.929
The understanding
that I've clearly
learned my lesson?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.097
The shunning bench.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.425
The bench where kids wait
to see the school nurse
for their lice check?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.004
Yes, but we spray it.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.407
And it's also part
of a hallowed
Quaker tradition.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.841
The guilty student sits there

14:01.875 --> 14:05.612
while his classmates scorn him
as they casually stroll by.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.947
It's a hoot.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.149
Sold! Gimme
the old-timey
benchy thing.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.518
Never! We accept
the full suspension.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.454
Why? There's
a perfectly viable
shaming option available.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.458
I'd rather have Adam sitting
at home, learning from me

14:18.491 --> 14:20.860
than from your lazy,
fresh-mouthed teachers.

14:20.894 --> 14:21.995
Come on, study buddy.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.696
Okey-dokey.
That works, too.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.632
While my mom
was shunning the bench,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.634
Geoff was facing
an angry customer.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.336
I ordered a cheesesteak.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.080
What's this green thing
with the red things in it?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.973
You mean a salad?
How am I supposed to know?

14:33.006 --> 14:34.374
I'm so sorry.
I-I'll fix it.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.009
Don't put up with his nonsense.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.110
He's a platinum member.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.079
Not for long,
unless I get
a new cheesesteak.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.313
But Lee's is closed.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.649
Well, you better find out
who took mine, Barnaby Jones.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.727
I mean, I guess
there's only a few houses
it could have gone to.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.653
You're driving.
Wait, you're going, too?

14:46.686 --> 14:47.787
I want to see for myself

14:47.820 --> 14:49.990
what kind of person
takes another man's sandwich.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.858
And so the great
cheesesteak search began.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.094
Hello, sir.
Hello, ma'am.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.129
Hello, sir.
I run a food-delivery service.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.464
Put me down for a beer, please.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.366
We're actually looking
for a missing order.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.001
But you do deliver beer, right?

15:01.034 --> 15:03.803
I just wanted to confirm
that your order
was up to our standards.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.373
Sure. But my standards
are very low.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.175
One time, I ordered a pizza.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.877
Honest to God,
it had three screws on it.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.045
I ate it anyway.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.081
With the screws?
No, dumbass!

15:14.114 --> 15:15.715
We're looking
for a lost cheesesteak.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.084
Hey, here's a fun fact...

15:17.117 --> 15:18.751
The, uh, Philly-style
steak sandwich

Definitely not

15:31.264 --> 15:33.409
You know, the French
have their own version
of hide-and-seek.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.534
It's called "Sardines."

15:34.567 --> 15:37.204
A little fun twist, though,
there's only one hider.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.838
Everybody else seeks.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.707
He's a bit off.
I'm out of here.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.609
Is he with you?
I don't see it.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.511
That's it.
I'm getting a bat.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.578
What? No!

15:46.113 --> 15:47.280
Hi, ma'am.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.924
You didn't get a cheesesteak
by accident, did you?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.017
In fact, I did.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.094
Could I possibly get that back?

15:51.118 --> 15:52.585
Mm, that's gonna be kinda tough.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.729
I already
ate the hell out of it.

As Geoff's
business took him
all over town,

16:02.262 --> 16:04.564
I was at home,

Woodburn had it out for us,

16:40.367 --> 16:41.910
I know it doesn't
seem like enough time,

16:41.934 --> 16:44.237
but it could also be
one of your electives.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.338
This was a big mistake.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.774

to want your help.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.143
Pretended?
I-I thought we were stud buds.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.311
We were never stud buds!

16:51.344 --> 16:53.480
And, oh, my God,
don't call it that!

16:53.513 --> 16:54.814
So we're not stud buds?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.617
Stop that! And no!

Gosh, I just wanted you

17:01.588 --> 17:03.756
