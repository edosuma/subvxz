02:05.209 --> 02:08.334
<i>People are always asking me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

02:08.380 --> 02:09.880
Three minutes.

02:09.970 --> 02:12.420
This is it. Ground zero.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.090
Would you like to say a few words for the occasion?

02:16.550 --> 02:19.680
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

02:19.770 --> 02:21.430
I can't think of anything.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.690
<i>For a second, totally I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

02:25.770 --> 02:27.900
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

02:27.980 --> 02:29.940
It's getting exciting now.

02:30.030 --> 02:33.150
<i>That old saying,
how you always hurt the one you love,</i>

02:33.240 --> 02:35.240
<i>well, it works both ways.</i>

02:35.950 --> 02:39.830
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theatre of mass destruction.</i>

02:39.910 --> 02:42.160
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

02:42.250 --> 02:46.830
<i>wrapped the foundation columns
of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>

02:46.920 --> 02:49.550
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

02:49.630 --> 02:53.090
<i>and a few square blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i>

02:53.590 --> 02:56.220
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

02:56.720 --> 03:00.220
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

03:00.310 --> 03:05.850
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>

03:05.940 --> 03:09.400
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

03:11.230 --> 03:13.610
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

03:14.740 --> 03:18.370
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

03:18.450 --> 03:21.790
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

03:22.250 --> 03:23.830
We're still men.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.830
Yes, we're men.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.130
Men is what we are.

03:28.201 --> 03:32.960
<i>Eight months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

03:33.010 --> 03:35.880
<i>He developed bitch tits
'cause his testosterone was too high</i>

03:35.970 --> 03:38.050
<i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>

03:38.140 --> 03:39.562
<i>That was where I fit.</i>

03:39.564 --> 03:42.431
I think they're gonna have to open up
my pecs again and drain the fluid.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.390
<i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>

03:44.480 --> 03:47.900
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

03:47.980 --> 03:50.150
Okay , you cry now.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.230
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

03:55.030 --> 03:57.490
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

03:57.610 --> 03:59.780
<i>I couldn't sleep...</i>

04:00.410 --> 04:02.660
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

04:03.620 --> 04:05.500
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

04:05.660 --> 04:07.920
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:09.420
<i>of a copy.</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:14.920
<i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>

04:15.010 --> 04:18.010
<i>it'll be the corporations
that name everything.</i>

04:18.220 --> 04:20.140
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

04:20.680 --> 04:22.510
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

04:22.970 --> 04:24.890
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:28.270
I need you out of town a little more this week.
We've got some red flags to cover.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.940
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.</i>

04:32.020 --> 04:36.650
You want me to deprioritise my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

04:36.740 --> 04:41.280
Make these your primary action items. Here's your flight
coupons. Call me from the road if there's any snags.

04:41.370 --> 04:45.120
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

04:47.460 --> 04:52.250
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>

04:52.880 --> 04:57.130
- Yes. I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
<i>- Please hold.</i>

04:57.220 --> 04:59.970
<i>If I saw something clever,
like a little coffee table</i>

05:00.050 --> 05:03.050
<i>in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

05:04.180 --> 05:06.520
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

05:06.600 --> 05:09.180
<i>The Hovetrekke home Exerbike.</i>

05:09.270 --> 05:12.980
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

05:13.400 --> 05:17.900
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>

05:18.400 --> 05:20.320
<i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder:</i>

05:20.410 --> 05:23.620
<i>What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?</i>

05:24.580 --> 05:29.290
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

05:29.370 --> 05:31.500
<i>proof that they were
crafted by the honest,</i>

05:31.580 --> 05:34.170
<i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

05:34.250 --> 05:35.630
<i>- Please hold.
- ...wherever.</i>

05:35.758 --> 05:38.273
- I was holding.
<i>- Your call is important to us.</i>

05:38.340 --> 05:40.220
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

05:40.300 --> 05:42.220
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

05:42.300 --> 05:46.600
- No. You can't die from insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

05:47.140 --> 05:51.270
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.

05:51.350 --> 05:55.360
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

05:55.440 --> 05:58.480
<i>Red and blue Tuinals,
lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

05:59.070 --> 06:02.360
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

06:03.110 --> 06:06.410
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

06:09.580 --> 06:13.580
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

06:13.670 --> 06:18.460
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.

06:19.130 --> 06:20.670
That's pain.

06:36.310 --> 06:40.070
I always wanted three kids.
Two boys and a girl.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.400
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.410
We never could agree on anything.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.990
Well, she had her first child last week.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.160
A girl.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.170
With her... with her new husband.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.420
And thank God. You know?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.840
I-I'm glad for her.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.640
Because she deserves it.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.520
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

07:17.610 --> 07:19.270
Thank you, Thomas.

07:19.770 --> 07:23.070
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.400
And that gives me strength.

07:25.490 --> 07:27.610
We give each other strength.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.450
It's time for the one-on-ones.

07:29.530 --> 07:34.200
So let's all of us follow Thomas' good example
and really open ourselves up.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.080
Could you find a partner?

07:39.670 --> 07:42.250
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

07:43.720 --> 07:46.510
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

07:49.140 --> 07:52.310
<i>Knees together.
Those awkward little steps.</i>

07:57.980 --> 07:59.940
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

08:00.820 --> 08:03.190
<i>Bob had been a champion body builder.</i>

08:03.280 --> 08:06.650
<i>You know that chest expansion
program you see on late-night TV?</i>

08:06.740 --> 08:08.110
<i>That was his idea.</i>

08:08.200 --> 08:09.740
I was a juicer.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.620
You know - using steroids.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.620
Diabonal and... Wisterol.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.670
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ's sakes.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.420
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,

08:28.510 --> 08:33.350
my two grown kids
won't even return my phone calls.

08:34.770 --> 08:38.850
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

08:41.650 --> 08:43.520
Go ahead... Cornelius.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.030
You can cry.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.710
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

09:04.800 --> 09:06.550
That's really good.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.590
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

09:09.050 --> 09:11.300
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:15.310
<i>I found freedom.</i>

09:16.020 --> 09:18.310
<i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

09:20.350 --> 09:21.690
It's okay.

09:25.070 --> 09:27.280
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

09:30.490 --> 09:32.990
<i>I became addicted.</i>

09:46.750 --> 09:51.340
<i>If I didn't say anything,
people always assumed the worst.</i>

09:55.350 --> 09:57.640
<i>They cried harder...</i>

09:57.720 --> 09:58.970
<i>then I cried harder.</i>

10:07.690 --> 10:11.900
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

10:12.160 --> 10:14.110
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

10:14.490 --> 10:17.370
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

10:17.990 --> 10:21.710
<i>I was the warm little centre
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

10:22.540 --> 10:26.540
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.550
It moves over your body, healing you.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.130
Now keep this going.
Remember to breathe.

10:34.430 --> 10:37.720
And step forward
through the back door of the room.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.430
Where does it lead?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.520
To your cave.

10:43.190 --> 10:46.440
Step forward into your cave.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.860
That's right.

10:49.230 --> 10:52.530
<i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>

10:53.070 --> 10:57.910
<i>and you're going to find
your power animal.</i>

11:00.120 --> 11:01.500
Slide.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.300
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

11:15.470 --> 11:18.090
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

11:18.760 --> 11:20.140
<i>Resurrected.</i>

11:22.850 --> 11:27.020
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

11:27.100 --> 11:31.570
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,
ready to cry.</i>

11:32.150 --> 11:34.110
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

11:37.950 --> 11:41.620
<i>And she... ruined everything.</i>

11:41.700 --> 11:43.580
This is cancer, right?

11:46.790 --> 11:51.130
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.</i>

11:51.710 --> 11:53.260
<i>She was a liar.</i>

11:53.460 --> 11:55.800
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

11:56.050 --> 11:59.930
<i>I had seen her at Free and Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

12:00.010 --> 12:03.140
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

12:04.100 --> 12:07.850
<i>And again at Seize the Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

12:11.150 --> 12:13.980
<i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:16.990
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

12:17.150 --> 12:19.740
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

12:19.820 --> 12:24.450
<i>I couldn't cry.
So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>

12:36.840 --> 12:39.340
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:42.800
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

12:42.890 --> 12:45.770
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch Marla Singer
and scream:</i>

12:45.850 --> 12:50.060
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!

12:51.610 --> 12:53.730
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

12:54.690 --> 12:55.820
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

12:55.900 --> 12:59.110
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep</i>

12:59.740 --> 13:01.990
<i>and you're never really awake.</i>

13:04.290 --> 13:08.370
To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.790
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:15.300
<i>Chloe looked the way
Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i>

13:15.380 --> 13:19.380
<i>if you made it smile and walk around a
party being extra nice to everybody.</i>

13:20.050 --> 13:21.840
Well, I'm still here.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.720
But I don't know for how long.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.600
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

13:29.270 --> 13:31.390
But I've got some good news.

13:31.980 --> 13:34.480
I no longer have any fear of death.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.110
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.410
No one will have sex with me.

13:46.620 --> 13:47.660
I'm so close to the end,

13:47.750 --> 13:50.910
and all I want is to get laid for
the last time.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.460
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

13:54.540 --> 13:57.920
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.130
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.390
Thank you, Chloe.

14:06.310 --> 14:10.020
Now, let's ready ourself
for guided meditation.

14:12.270 --> 14:15.310
You're standing at the entrance
of your cave.

14:15.820 --> 14:19.030
You step inside your cave and you walk...

14:19.280 --> 14:22.570
<i>if I did have a tumour, I'd name it Marla.</i>

14:23.780 --> 14:24.950
<i>Marla.</i>

14:25.160 --> 14:27.160
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>

14:27.240 --> 14:30.700
<i>that would heal if you could stop
tonguing it, but you can't.</i>

14:30.790 --> 14:34.170
...deeper into your cave as you walk.

14:35.630 --> 14:38.960
<i>You feel the healing energy of
this place all around you.</i>

14:41.050 --> 14:43.130
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

14:47.600 --> 14:48.850
Slide.

14:52.730 --> 14:55.230
Okay. Let's partner up.

14:55.810 --> 14:58.360
Pick someone special to you tonight.

15:04.490 --> 15:05.570
Hey.

15:06.910 --> 15:08.830
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

15:14.210 --> 15:15.920
- I'm onto you.
- What?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

15:20.171 --> 15:20.920
Sorry?

15:21.010 --> 15:25.590
In the Tibetan-philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.180
All right, but you're not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.510
So?

15:31.270 --> 15:33.020
So you're a tourist.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.770
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

15:37.860 --> 15:39.900
I saw you at testicular cancer!

15:39.980 --> 15:42.030
I saw you practising this.

15:42.190 --> 15:44.320
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.410
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"Rupert"?

15:48.870 --> 15:51.700
- I'll expose you.
- Go ahead. I'll expose you.

15:51.790 --> 15:54.700
All right, come together. Let yourselves cry.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.630
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

16:04.720 --> 16:07.130
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee's.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.930
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

16:11.010 --> 16:13.140
I've been coming for over a year.

16:13.220 --> 16:16.230
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

16:16.310 --> 16:20.150
When people think you're dying, then they
really really listen to you instead of just...

16:20.230 --> 16:23.150
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.690
Yeah. Yeah.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.280
Share yourself, completely.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.330
Look, you don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.660
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

16:36.750 --> 16:40.170
I can't cry if another faker is present,
and I need this.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.840
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.010
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

16:49.010 --> 16:51.916
Wait a second. Hold on. I'll tell you.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.770
We're gonna split up the week, okay?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.520
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.020
Okay. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

17:02.110 --> 17:06.150
Technically, I have more right to be there than you.
You still have your balls.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.609
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

17:08.950 --> 17:10.150
No. No.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.200
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.040
You can't have both the parasites, but
why don't you take the blood parasites.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.700
I want brain parasites.

17:17.790 --> 17:20.915
I'll take the blood parasites,
but I'm gonna take the organic brain dementia.

17:20.954 --> 17:23.380
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.050
So far, you have four. I only have two.

17:26.130 --> 17:29.630
Okay. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.260
Now we both have three...

17:35.930 --> 17:38.470
Hey! You left half your clothes.

17:54.580 --> 17:58.580
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.750
So, we each have three. That's six.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.250
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.420
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

18:05.500 --> 18:10.380
- No. No. I want bowel cancer.
- That's your favourite too?

18:10.880 --> 18:14.510
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we're gonna split it.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.890
Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.230
Deal.

18:23.980 --> 18:27.610
- Looks like this is goodbye.
- Well, let's not make a big thing out of it, okay.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.320
How's this for not making a big thing?

18:34.820 --> 18:36.950
Hey, Marla! Marla!

18:38.950 --> 18:42.370
- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
- Should we?

18:42.620 --> 18:44.830
We might wanna switch nights.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.090
Okay.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.180
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

18:56.680 --> 19:00.390
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
is that she might die at any moment.</i>

19:00.470 --> 19:03.020
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

19:03.100 --> 19:05.480
It doesn't have your name! Who are you?

19:05.560 --> 19:08.820
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?

19:08.900 --> 19:11.820
Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

19:14.700 --> 19:16.700
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

19:17.280 --> 19:19.740
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

19:20.830 --> 19:25.250
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.
Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>

19:25.960 --> 19:30.170
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

19:30.250 --> 19:33.300
Check-in for that flight
doesn't begin for another two hours, sir.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.010
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

19:37.800 --> 19:40.850
<i>You wake up at Air Harbour International.</i>

19:41.720 --> 19:45.390
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

19:45.810 --> 19:48.600
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

19:49.570 --> 19:52.070
<i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>

19:52.820 --> 19:57.450
<i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,
single pat of butter.</i>

19:58.240 --> 20:00.910
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

20:00.990 --> 20:06.000
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample
package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>

20:08.250 --> 20:12.250
<i>The people I meet on each flight,
they're single-serving friends.</i>

20:13.630 --> 20:18.430
<i>Between take-off and landing, we have
our time together, but that's all we get.</i>

20:19.220 --> 20:20.470
<i>Welcome!</i>

20:22.640 --> 20:23.890
<i>On a long-enough time line,</i>

20:23.970 --> 20:27.140
<i>the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.</i>

20:27.230 --> 20:30.940
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

20:31.020 --> 20:34.110
The infant went through the windshield.
Three points.

20:34.190 --> 20:38.280
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.</i>

20:38.360 --> 20:40.660
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

20:40.740 --> 20:43.620
The teenager's braces
are wrapped around the back-seat ashtray.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.910
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.870
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

20:48.960 --> 20:51.330
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

20:51.670 --> 20:53.090
The father must've been huge.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.880
See where the fat's burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

20:56.970 --> 20:58.670
Very modern art.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.720
<i>Take the number of
vehicles in the field, A.</i>

21:01.800 --> 21:04.430
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate
of failure, B.</i>

21:04.520 --> 21:08.270
<i>Then multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:10.690
<i>A x B x C...</i>

21:10.900 --> 21:12.150
equals X.

21:12.230 --> 21:16.820
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
we don't do one.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.950
Are there a lot of these
kinds of accidents?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.910
You wouldn't believe.

21:24.580 --> 21:27.040
Which car company do you work for?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.370
A major one.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.500
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on take-off or landing,</i>

21:35.590 --> 21:39.090
<i>I prayed for a crash
or a mid-air collision.</i>

21:39.170 --> 21:40.470
<i>Anything.</i>

21:50.230 --> 21:54.310
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

21:56.650 --> 21:59.570
"If you are seated
in an emergency exit row

22:01.030 --> 22:05.780
"and feel you would be unable or unwilling to
perform the duties listed on the safety card,

22:05.870 --> 22:08.870
"please ask a flight attendant
to reseat you."

22:10.160 --> 22:14.380
- it's a lot of responsibility.
- Wanna switch seats?

22:14.460 --> 22:17.920
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

22:18.010 --> 22:22.090
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.640
The illusion of safety.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.760
Yeah. I guess so.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.470
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

22:30.560 --> 22:34.440
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.110
In a catastrophic emergency,
you're taking giant panic breaths.

22:39.280 --> 22:43.110
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.570
It's all right here.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.870
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

22:49.950 --> 22:53.040
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.290
That's...

22:56.170 --> 22:58.710
That's an interesting theory.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.470
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

23:03.550 --> 23:04.970
What do you do for a living?

23:05.050 --> 23:08.010
Why? So you can pretend
likeyou're interested?

23:11.270 --> 23:12.270
Okay.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.560
You have a kind of
sick desperation in your laugh.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.150
We have the exact same briefcase.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.400
Soap.

23:23.490 --> 23:26.700
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

23:27.410 --> 23:29.700
The yardstick of civilization.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.120
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

23:32.200 --> 23:33.790
"Tyler Durden".

23:34.250 --> 23:36.080
Did you know if you mixed equal parts of gasoline

23:36.170 --> 23:39.590
and frozen orange juice concentrate,
you can make napalm?

23:39.670 --> 23:42.340
- No, I did not know that. Is that true?
- That's right.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.010
One can make all kinds of explosives
using simple household items.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.640
- Really?
- If one were so inclined.

23:53.850 --> 23:58.730
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I've ever met.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.860
- See, everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.570
Thank you.

24:07.450 --> 24:09.450
How's that working out for you?

24:09.530 --> 24:11.280
- What?
- Being clever.

24:12.830 --> 24:17.040
- Great.
- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.080
Now, a question of etiquette.

24:20.170 --> 24:23.250
As I pass,
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.010
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

24:33.100 --> 24:36.390
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

24:44.740 --> 24:46.240
Was it ticking?

24:46.320 --> 24:49.610
Actually, throwers don't worry about
ticking because modern bombs don't tick.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.330
- Sorry. Throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

24:53.580 --> 24:57.660
But when a suitcase vibrates,
then the throwers got to call the police.

24:57.750 --> 25:00.420
My suitcase was vibrating?

25:00.500 --> 25:05.800
Nine times out of ten it's an electric
razor, but... every once in a while...

25:08.930 --> 25:10.470
it's a dildo.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.720
Of course it's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

25:15.810 --> 25:21.690
We have to use the indefinite article -
"a dildo", never "your dildo".

25:21.770 --> 25:23.480
I don't own...

25:26.690 --> 25:33.490
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>

25:35.200 --> 25:36.740
<i>Never mind.</i>

25:38.830 --> 25:41.460
Hey! That's my car!

25:48.510 --> 25:51.380
<i>Home was a condo on
the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i>

25:51.470 --> 25:53.760
<i>for widows and young professionals.</i>

25:53.850 --> 25:55.850
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

25:55.930 --> 25:59.230
<i>A foot of concrete's important
when your next-door neighbour</i>

25:59.310 --> 26:02.140
<i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

26:02.230 --> 26:06.520
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

26:06.610 --> 26:10.400
<i>blows out of your floor to ceiling windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

26:16.790 --> 26:19.250
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

26:32.050 --> 26:34.180
There's... nothing up there.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.510
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

26:46.310 --> 26:48.820
Do you have somebody you can call?

26:49.570 --> 26:53.990
<i>How embarrassing.
A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

27:04.040 --> 27:06.040
<i>The police would later tell me that the pilot light</i>

27:06.130 --> 27:10.993
<i>might have gone out,
letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

27:11.050 --> 27:13.630
<i>That gas could have
slowly filled the condo,</i>

27:13.720 --> 27:16.140
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings,</i>

27:16.220 --> 27:18.140
<i>for days and days.</i>

27:25.400 --> 27:29.230
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

27:31.110 --> 27:32.280
<i>Yeah?</i>

27:35.240 --> 27:37.620
<i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>

27:47.250 --> 27:50.790
<i>if you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

28:33.420 --> 28:35.170
- Hello?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

28:37.380 --> 28:39.930
- Tyler?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

28:40.010 --> 28:41.260
Um...

28:41.600 --> 28:43.890
We met... We met on the airplane.

28:43.970 --> 28:45.980
We had the same suitcase?

28:46.560 --> 28:50.270
- Uh... the clever guy.
<i>- Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

28:52.570 --> 28:56.440
I called a second ago.
There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.

28:56.530 --> 28:59.450
<i>Yeah, I *69'd you.
I never pick up my phone.</i>

29:02.160 --> 29:03.990
<i>So what's up?</i>

29:05.040 --> 29:06.330
Well...

29:07.160 --> 29:08.830
You're not gonna believe this.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.540
You know man, it could be worse.

29:13.630 --> 29:18.130
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep
and toss it out the window of a moving car.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.470
There's always that.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.680
It's just, when you buy furniture,
you tell yourself:

29:23.970 --> 29:26.180
That's it. That's the last sofa I'll need.

29:26.270 --> 29:30.060
Whatever else happens,
I've got that sofa problem handled.

29:30.150 --> 29:33.360
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

29:33.570 --> 29:36.110
A wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

29:36.190 --> 29:38.860
I was close to being complete.

29:38.950 --> 29:42.030
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone.
- All gone.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.370
All gone.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.580
Do you know what a duvet is?

29:49.160 --> 29:52.170
- It's a comforter.
- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.

29:52.710 --> 29:55.130
Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?

29:55.210 --> 29:59.380
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?

29:59.630 --> 30:00.800
No.

30:01.430 --> 30:05.600
- What are we, then?
- I dunno. Consumers.

30:05.890 --> 30:07.890
Right. We're consumers.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.060
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

30:12.020 --> 30:15.480
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

30:15.570 --> 30:18.400
What concerns me
are celebrity magazines,

30:18.900 --> 30:21.280
television with 500 channels,

30:21.360 --> 30:22.990
some guy's name on my underwear.

30:23.070 --> 30:25.660
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.370
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.460
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down, man.

30:32.540 --> 30:36.750
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.300
I say never be complete.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.470
I say stop being perfect.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.760
I say let's evolve.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.600
Let the chips fall where they may.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.520
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.850
It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.

30:55.940 --> 30:59.440
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

30:59.530 --> 31:02.190
Fuck, you're right. No, I don't smoke.

31:05.620 --> 31:08.660
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

31:12.290 --> 31:16.580
- What?
- The things you own end up owning you.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.170
But do what you like, man.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.680
Oh, it's late.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.970
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.060
I should find a hotel.

31:32.209 --> 31:33.539
What?

31:33.810 --> 31:34.850
What?

31:34.940 --> 31:36.480
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.770
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

31:39.860 --> 31:43.400
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.450
- What?
- You called me

31:47.530 --> 31:49.450
'cause you need a place to stay.

31:49.530 --> 31:53.040
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.660
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.670
Would... Would that be a problem?

31:59.750 --> 32:02.050
Is it a problem for you to ask?

32:02.960 --> 32:05.300
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.180
Thanks.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.600
- I want you to do me a favour.
- Yeah, sure.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.600
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

32:19.110 --> 32:23.690
- What?
- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.740
<i>Let me tell you a little bit
about Tyler Durden.</i>

32:28.030 --> 32:32.030
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.950
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

32:35.040 --> 32:38.540
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

32:38.630 --> 32:42.000
So someone has to be there to switch
the projectors at the exact moment

32:42.090 --> 32:44.590
that one reel ends
and the next one begins.

32:44.670 --> 32:49.640
If you look for them, you can see little dots come
into the upper right corner of the screen.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.550
In the industry,
we call them cigarette burns.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.350
That's the cue for a changeover.

32:54.430 --> 32:59.230
He flips the projectors, movie keeps right on
going and nobody in the audience has any idea.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.060
Why would anyone want this shit job?

33:02.150 --> 33:04.940
'Cause it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

33:05.030 --> 33:07.990
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.660
So when the snooty cat
and the courageous dog

33:10.740 --> 33:13.990
with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three,

33:14.080 --> 33:17.790
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.510
Nobody knows
that they saw it but they did.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.590
Nice big cock.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.430
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

33:42.900 --> 33:47.650
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

33:52.780 --> 33:56.490
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

33:56.950 --> 33:59.120
Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.

33:59.210 --> 34:01.040
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

34:01.120 --> 34:03.750
he farted on meringues,
sneezed on braised endives...

34:03.840 --> 34:06.460
As for the cream of mushroom soup...

34:06.550 --> 34:09.969
- Go ahead, tell 'em.
- You get the idea.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.146
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

34:12.148 --> 34:13.721
Come on. Do me this one favour.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.620
Why?

34:14.621 --> 34:17.061
Why? I don't know why. I don't know.
Never been in a fight. You?

34:17.139 --> 34:18.804
No. But that's a good thing.

34:18.829 --> 34:21.717
No it is not. How much can you know about
yourself if you've never been in a fight?

34:21.730 --> 34:23.900
I don't wanna die without any scars.

34:23.980 --> 34:28.190
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.239
So go crazy! Let her rip.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.570
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

34:33.659 --> 34:36.580
Who gives a shit? No one's watching.
What do you care?

34:36.659 --> 34:38.989
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?

34:39.080 --> 34:40.580
That's right.

34:41.210 --> 34:44.170
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

34:46.590 --> 34:48.630
This is so fucking stupid.

34:59.310 --> 35:03.770
Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!

35:03.850 --> 35:07.020
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow! Christ!

35:07.520 --> 35:08.770
Why the ear, man?

35:08.860 --> 35:11.320
- I fucked it up.
- No, that was perfect.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.040
No, it's all right.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.250
It really hurts.

35:29.550 --> 35:30.710
Right.

35:31.970 --> 35:36.340
- Hit me again.
- No, you hit me. Come on!

35:53.280 --> 35:55.780
We should do this again sometime.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.630
- Where's your car?
- What car?

36:21.760 --> 36:26.020
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,
but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

36:26.100 --> 36:29.270
<i>It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.</i>

36:29.360 --> 36:31.730
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

36:31.820 --> 36:33.320
<i>There was no lock on the front door</i>

36:33.400 --> 36:36.490
<i>from when the police,
or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

36:36.700 --> 36:39.200
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

36:39.280 --> 36:42.120
<i>I didn't know if he owned it
or if he was squatting.</i>

36:42.200 --> 36:44.700
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

36:45.040 --> 36:46.620
Yep. That's you.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.920
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.460
Yeah, thanks.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.420
<i>What a shithole.</i>

36:55.630 --> 36:57.300
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

37:00.260 --> 37:04.060
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

37:04.140 --> 37:07.430
<i>There were no neighbours.
Just some warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

37:07.520 --> 37:11.440
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

37:13.440 --> 37:15.440
Hey. What have we here?

37:30.710 --> 37:32.330
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

37:44.390 --> 37:47.560
<i>Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.</i>

37:47.640 --> 37:51.100
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

37:52.270 --> 37:55.770
<i>I didn't even mind the warm,
stale refrigerator.</i>

38:08.700 --> 38:10.370
Can I be next?

38:14.710 --> 38:16.210
All right, man.

38:16.300 --> 38:17.750
Lose the tie.

38:22.510 --> 38:26.680
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

38:32.730 --> 38:36.230
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

38:36.320 --> 38:38.940
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

38:39.030 --> 38:42.280
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

38:42.820 --> 38:46.030
<i>The previous occupant
had been a bit of a shut-in.</i>

38:46.120 --> 38:48.370
- Hey man, what are you reading?
- Listen to this.

38:48.450 --> 38:51.910
It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.330
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata."

38:54.420 --> 38:56.170
"Without me, Jack could not regulate

38:56.250 --> 38:58.880
"his heart rate,
blood pressure or breathing."

38:58.960 --> 39:01.090
There's a whole series of these.

39:01.170 --> 39:05.510
"I Am Jill's Nipples."
"I Am Jack's Colon."

39:05.600 --> 39:08.180
Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

39:11.930 --> 39:16.100
<i>After fighting, everything else in
your life got the volume turned down.</i>

39:18.570 --> 39:19.520
What?

39:19.610 --> 39:23.610
<i>- You could deal with anything.</i>
- Have you finished those reports?

39:28.280 --> 39:30.120
<i>If you could fight anyone,
who would you fight?</i>

39:31.000 --> 39:33.040
I'd fight my boss, probably.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.290
Really?

39:35.290 --> 39:38.630
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.710
I don't know my dad.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.470
I mean, I know him, but he left
when I was, like, six years old.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.090
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.050
He, like, did this every six years.

39:49.140 --> 39:53.810
- He moves city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises.

39:55.690 --> 39:59.560
My dad never went to college,
so it was real important that I go.

39:59.650 --> 40:01.070
That sounds familiar.

40:01.150 --> 40:04.990
So I graduate. I call him up long distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

40:05.070 --> 40:07.240
- He says, "Get a job."
- Same here.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.990
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
"Dad, now what?"

40:12.200 --> 40:14.540
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

40:16.790 --> 40:18.670
You can't get married.

40:19.090 --> 40:20.960
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.300
We're a generation of men
raised by women.

40:24.380 --> 40:28.180
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

40:33.980 --> 40:37.190
<i>Most of the week,
we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

40:38.520 --> 40:42.070
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

40:42.980 --> 40:46.530
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

40:50.370 --> 40:54.490
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

40:54.580 --> 40:57.000
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

40:57.290 --> 40:59.620
<i>I should have been
looking for a new condo.</i>

40:59.710 --> 41:02.290
<i>I should have been haggling
with my insurance company.</i>

41:02.380 --> 41:07.170
<i>I should have been upset about my nice,
neat, flaming little shit, but I wasn't.</i>

41:07.510 --> 41:11.390
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.720
<i>Monday mornings,
all I thought about was next week.</i>

41:14.810 --> 41:17.680
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

41:17.770 --> 41:19.270
Absolutely.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.060
Efficiency is priority no. 1, people.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.690
Because waste is a thief.

41:25.480 --> 41:29.070
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

41:32.580 --> 41:35.870
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

41:37.500 --> 41:41.580
<i>It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

41:41.750 --> 41:46.420
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

41:57.430 --> 42:00.270
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!

42:21.750 --> 42:24.290
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

42:46.110 --> 42:49.570
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules
that he and I decided.</i>

42:49.650 --> 42:51.150
Gentlemen!

42:51.740 --> 42:53.700
Welcome to Fight Club.

42:56.240 --> 43:00.250
The first rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.500
The second rule of Fight Club is...

43:03.670 --> 43:06.460
you do not talk about Fight Club!

43:07.500 --> 43:08.920
Third rule of Fight Club:

43:09.000 --> 43:12.510
someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

43:12.590 --> 43:14.260
the fight is over.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.260
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.

43:17.970 --> 43:20.770
Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.810
Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.

43:25.190 --> 43:29.230
Seventh rule: fights will go on
as long as they have to.

43:31.650 --> 43:37.070
And the eighth and final rule: if this is
your first night at Fight Club,

43:38.120 --> 43:39.280
you have to fight.

43:44.170 --> 43:45.920
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

43:46.000 --> 43:50.300
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

43:51.550 --> 43:53.470
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

43:53.550 --> 43:57.180
<i>when he trounced
the maître d' of a local food court.</i>

43:59.390 --> 44:01.010
<i>Sometimes,
all you could hear were the flat,</i>

44:01.100 --> 44:04.060
<i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

44:07.610 --> 44:10.770
<i>Or the wet choke when someone
caught their breath and sprayed...</i>

44:10.860 --> 44:12.070
Stop!

44:12.610 --> 44:15.280
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

44:15.360 --> 44:20.370
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.</i>

44:21.290 --> 44:23.660
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

44:23.750 --> 44:26.120
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

44:26.210 --> 44:27.540
<i>Who you were in Fight Club</i>

44:27.630 --> 44:30.500
<i>is not who you were
in the rest of the world.</i>

44:30.590 --> 44:34.920
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first
time. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

44:35.010 --> 44:38.260
<i>After a few weeks,
he was carved out of wood.</i>

44:38.930 --> 44:41.850
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

44:41.930 --> 44:45.060
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

44:46.140 --> 44:48.440
Hemingway. You?

44:49.900 --> 44:52.940
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.650
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

44:58.360 --> 45:01.740
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

45:05.790 --> 45:08.330
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

45:08.420 --> 45:12.460
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

45:12.550 --> 45:14.960
Is that what a man looks like?

45:15.420 --> 45:18.130
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.760
Now, self-destruction...

45:20.840 --> 45:22.260
Excuse me.

45:57.420 --> 46:00.010
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

46:00.090 --> 46:02.050
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

46:04.680 --> 46:09.480
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,
like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

46:14.570 --> 46:16.360
- Is that it?
- Stop!

46:16.820 --> 46:19.780
<i>When the fight was over,
nothing was solved.</i>

46:20.200 --> 46:21.860
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

46:21.950 --> 46:23.030
Cool.

46:25.410 --> 46:27.910
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

46:28.000 --> 46:30.410
Hey, man. How about next week?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.420
How about next month?

46:33.750 --> 46:36.840
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.300
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

46:41.380 --> 46:43.380
He fell down some stairs.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.100
I fell down some stairs.

46:48.270 --> 46:52.640
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

46:52.730 --> 46:54.730
Okay. Any historical figure.

46:55.810 --> 46:59.480
- I'd fight Gandhi.
- Good answer.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.400
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

47:02.780 --> 47:04.410
Lincoln?

47:05.030 --> 47:08.660
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.120
Fuck!

47:12.540 --> 47:15.290
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

47:24.220 --> 47:25.220
Hello?

47:25.300 --> 47:28.140
<i>Where have you been
the last eight weeks?</i>

47:28.649 --> 47:29.470
<i>Marla?</i>

47:32.850 --> 47:35.940
- How did you find me?
<i>- You left a forwarding number.</i>

47:36.020 --> 47:38.820
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.860
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

47:42.320 --> 47:45.150
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

47:45.360 --> 47:48.070
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.870
I found a new one.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.290
- Really?
- It's for men only.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.080
Like the testicle thing?

47:59.590 --> 48:03.170
- Look, this is a bad time.
- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

48:03.260 --> 48:06.220
<i>- You wanna see some really fucked-up people...</i>
- I'm just on my way out.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.100
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

48:09.470 --> 48:13.470
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.560
<i>Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

48:17.650 --> 48:21.480
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably just a cry for help things.

48:22.070 --> 48:23.650
<i>This could go on for hours.</i>

48:23.740 --> 48:27.910
- So you're staying in tonight then?
- Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?

48:28.820 --> 48:32.910
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

48:35.080 --> 48:37.170
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

49:03.530 --> 49:05.610
<i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>

49:05.690 --> 49:08.860
<i>I'd been living here for two months
and Tyler's door was never closed.</i>

49:14.870 --> 49:17.290
You won't believe the dream
I had last night.

49:17.370 --> 49:20.420
I can hardly believe
anything from last night.

49:30.390 --> 49:32.350
What are you doing here?

49:36.230 --> 49:37.680
- What?
- This is my house.

49:37.770 --> 49:39.770
What are you doing in my house?

49:41.900 --> 49:43.190
Fuck you!

49:58.370 --> 50:01.460
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends! I'm telling you.

50:02.710 --> 50:05.913
Limber, though. Silly cooze.

50:07.460 --> 50:11.380
So I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
Guess who's on the other end.

50:11.470 --> 50:13.970
<i>I already knew the story
before he told it to me.</i>

50:17.430 --> 50:20.560
<i>Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?</i>

50:20.640 --> 50:23.600
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

50:23.690 --> 50:26.570
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

50:29.860 --> 50:33.320
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

50:33.950 --> 50:38.620
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

50:38.790 --> 50:41.960
<i>Now how could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing</i>

50:42.040 --> 50:44.630
<i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

50:45.090 --> 50:49.800
<i>...five, four, three...</i>

50:50.090 --> 50:51.510
<i>Hang on.</i>

50:56.560 --> 50:58.640
You got here fast.

51:01.140 --> 51:02.690
Did I call you?

51:04.100 --> 51:05.150
Huh?

51:13.490 --> 51:16.620
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.910
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

51:25.290 --> 51:28.960
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.

51:41.100 --> 51:44.020
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.940
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

51:49.020 --> 51:51.150
She has lost faith in herself.

51:51.230 --> 51:53.990
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

51:54.070 --> 51:58.280
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

51:58.370 --> 52:01.290
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

52:07.710 --> 52:11.210
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.380
You're gonna have to keep me up...

52:15.880 --> 52:17.550
all night.

52:17.970 --> 52:19.890
Un-fucking-believable.

52:20.390 --> 52:22.220
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

52:22.310 --> 52:25.690
- You know what I mean. You fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

52:27.230 --> 52:28.560
- Never?
- No.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.610
- You're not into her, are you?
- No! God, not at all.

52:33.990 --> 52:36.150
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

52:36.240 --> 52:39.820
- Are you sure? You can tell me.
- Believe me, I'm sure.

52:39.910 --> 52:41.160
<i>Put a gun to my head</i>

52:41.240 --> 52:43.490
<i>- and paint the walls with my brains.</i>
- That's good.

52:43.580 --> 52:46.790
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

52:49.750 --> 52:52.500
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

52:52.590 --> 52:53.750
My God.

52:54.130 --> 52:57.430
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

52:58.758 --> 53:00.390
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

53:00.470 --> 53:03.810
<i>The night before last, he was splicing
sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>

53:03.890 --> 53:06.230
Marla doesn't need a lover,
she needs a fucking caseworker.

53:06.310 --> 53:09.440
She needs a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

53:09.900 --> 53:12.900
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now she'd invaded my home.</i>

53:12.980 --> 53:14.730
Hey, hey. Sit down.

53:19.200 --> 53:23.080
- Listen, I can't have you talking to her about me.
- Why would I talk to her?

53:23.160 --> 53:24.950
You say anything about me
or what goes on

53:25.040 --> 53:28.330
in this house to her or anybody,
we're done.

53:29.170 --> 53:30.960
- Now promise me.
- Okay.

53:31.460 --> 53:33.040
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

53:33.130 --> 53:35.960
- Promise.
- I just said, I promise! What...

53:36.050 --> 53:38.380
That's three times you promised.

53:39.590 --> 53:43.760
<i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

53:43.850 --> 53:46.140
<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

53:50.520 --> 53:52.860
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!

54:00.910 --> 54:03.530
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

54:03.620 --> 54:07.500
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

54:08.080 --> 54:09.540
<i>But I didn't.</i>

54:33.940 --> 54:36.940
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

54:38.570 --> 54:41.280
- You wanna finish her off?
- Ooh!

54:42.740 --> 54:45.780
- No. No, thank you.
- I found a cigarette.

54:47.410 --> 54:49.410
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

54:50.710 --> 54:53.870
<i>I became the calm
little centre of the world.</i>

54:53.960 --> 54:55.790
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

55:01.090 --> 55:03.220
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

55:03.890 --> 55:06.100
<i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>

55:07.010 --> 55:08.720
Is that your blood?

55:10.890 --> 55:12.100
Some of it, yeah.

55:12.190 --> 55:13.640
You can't smoke in here.

55:16.020 --> 55:19.650
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

55:19.730 --> 55:21.530
Get yourself together.

55:21.610 --> 55:26.530
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile little face.
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

55:26.780 --> 55:30.410
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that.
I am enlightened."</i>

55:33.000 --> 55:37.420
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

55:37.840 --> 55:41.630
<i>go live in a dilapidated house
in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>

55:41.720 --> 55:43.920
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

55:55.690 --> 55:56.690
Hello?

55:56.770 --> 55:59.860
<i>Yes, this is Detective Stern
with the Arson Unit.</i>

56:00.400 --> 56:04.360
<i>We have new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

56:04.450 --> 56:06.240
- Yes?
- I don't know if you're aware,

56:06.320 --> 56:10.370
but it seems that someone sprayed Freon
into your front-door lock.

56:10.450 --> 56:13.370
<i>Then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

56:13.460 --> 56:16.870
- No, I wasn't aware of that at all.
<i>- I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

56:17.290 --> 56:21.300
- Does this sound strange to you?
<i>- Yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.</i>

56:21.840 --> 56:23.380
- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?

56:23.470 --> 56:27.510
...left a residue of
ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

56:28.050 --> 56:31.430
<i>- Do you know what this means?</i>
- No. What does it mean?

56:31.640 --> 56:33.640
It means it was home-made.

56:34.430 --> 56:37.350
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

56:37.440 --> 56:40.400
See whoever set this dynamite
could have blown out

56:40.480 --> 56:43.400
your pilot light days before the actual explosion.

56:43.490 --> 56:46.320
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.</i>
- Who'd go and do such a thing?

56:46.400 --> 56:48.820
<i>- I'll ask the questions.</i>
- Tell him.

56:49.320 --> 56:53.160
"Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property
realigned my perceptions."

56:53.250 --> 56:54.700
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

56:54.790 --> 56:58.290
Yes. it's hard to know
what to make of all this.

56:58.380 --> 57:00.420
Have you recently made enemies

57:00.500 --> 57:02.710
who might have access
to home-made dynamite?

57:02.800 --> 57:05.380
- Enemies?
- "I reject the basic assumption civilization,

57:05.470 --> 57:07.470
"especially the importance
of material possessions."

57:07.550 --> 57:10.180
<i>- Son, this is serious.</i>
- Yes, I know it's serious.

57:10.260 --> 57:13.100
<i>- I mean that.</i>
- Yes, it's very serious.

57:13.180 --> 57:18.980
Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. Okay?

57:19.520 --> 57:22.230
I loved every stick of
furniture in that place.

57:22.320 --> 57:25.530
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

57:25.610 --> 57:28.110
- It was me!
<i>- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

57:28.200 --> 57:32.450
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?</i>
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

57:32.700 --> 57:36.790
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

57:36.870 --> 57:40.750
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

57:40.830 --> 57:45.500
No, no. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.720
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Okay.

57:51.340 --> 57:52.470
<i>Except for their humping,</i>

57:52.550 --> 57:55.390
<i>Tyler and Marla were never
in the same room.</i>

57:55.470 --> 57:58.140
<i>My parents pulled
this exact same act for years.</i>

57:58.230 --> 58:01.600
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

58:02.560 --> 58:05.400
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

58:05.570 --> 58:09.280
You dance all night,
then you throw it away.

58:10.280 --> 58:13.030
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

58:14.410 --> 58:15.490
What?

58:20.330 --> 58:23.170
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.040
It was worth every penny.

58:25.130 --> 58:27.170
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

58:29.220 --> 58:33.180
Someone loved it intensely for one day,

58:34.390 --> 58:35.970
then tossed it.

58:37.600 --> 58:39.430
Like a Christmas tree.

58:39.980 --> 58:41.520
So special.

58:42.810 --> 58:44.770
Then... bam!

58:45.650 --> 58:47.860
It's on the side of the road.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.530
Tinsel still clinging to it.

58:52.490 --> 58:59.290
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear
inside out, bound with electrical tape.

58:59.790 --> 59:01.790
Well, then, it suits you.

59:02.290 --> 59:04.420
You can borrow it sometime.

59:11.630 --> 59:13.130
Get rid of her.

59:13.970 --> 59:16.550
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

59:16.640 --> 59:20.850
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

59:24.230 --> 59:26.980
- You know what? I really think it's time you got out of here.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

59:27.070 --> 59:31.940
- Not that we don't love your little visits.
- You know, you are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

59:33.740 --> 59:36.240
♪ Gotta get off ♪

59:36.320 --> 59:37.320
Thanks. Bye.

59:37.410 --> 59:42.660
♪ Gotta get off of this merry-go-round ♪

59:44.540 --> 59:49.170
♪ Gonna get, need to get, gotta get... ♪

59:52.840 --> 59:54.090
You kids!

59:55.550 --> 59:58.260
Why do you still waste time with her?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.810
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.310
What, and I'm not?

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.360
Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.570
What are we doing tonight?

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.690
Tonight... we make soap.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.070
- Really?
- To make soap, first we render fat.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:38.800
The salt balance has to be just right,

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:41.970
so the best fat for making soap
comes from humans.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.890
- Wait. What is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.530
Pay dirt!

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.240
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
The fat of the land!

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:08.750
No! Don't pull it.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.880
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.640
As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.610
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.530
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerine.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.860
If you would add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:44.160
If you then add sodium nitrate
and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.910
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.670
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:54.340
Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner
when washed in a certain point of the river.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.750
- You know why?
- No.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.720
'Cause human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.520
Bodies burned, water seeped
through the wooden ashes to create lye.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.060
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

01:02:09.131 --> 01:02:13.681
Once it mixed with the melted fat of the bodies,
thick white soapy discharge crept into the river.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.070
May I see your hand, please?

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.450
What is this?

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:27.330
This is a chemical burn.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.750
It'll hurt more than you've ever
been burned and you'll have a scar.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.330
<i>If meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this.</i>

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.420
- Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out.
- Oh, God!

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:38.375
Look at your hand.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.380
The first soap was made
from the ashes of heroes,

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.260
like the first monkey shot into space.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.470
Without pain, without sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.310
<i>I tried not to think
of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.310
Stop it! This is your pain,
this is your burning hand. It's right here.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:54.480
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.230
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320
- I get the point! Okay, please!
- No!

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.700
You're feeling premature enlightenment.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.990
It's the greatest moment of your life, man,
and you're off somewhere missing it!

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.620
I am not...

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:14.120
Shut up! Our fathers
were our models for God.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:17.090
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:23.880
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:27.640
He never wanted you.
In all probability, he hates you.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.140
This is not the worst thing
that can happen. We don't need him!

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.390
- We don't! I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.980
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.030
- I'm getting water!
- Listen! You can use water and make it worse or...

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.650
Look at me!

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.860
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me have it, please!

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.200
First, you have to give up.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.080
First, you have to know, not fear,

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.210
know that someday, you're gonna die.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.580
You don't know how this feels!

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:05.510
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.340
Okay.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.570
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting bottom.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.370
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores
at $20 a bar.</i>

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:34.960
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.880
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:40.840
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.630
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.220
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.510
<i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.390
"The first rule of Fight Club
is you don't talk about Fight Club"?

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.770
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.360
"The second rule of Fight..." Is this yours?

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.400
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:07.900
You find this. What would you do?

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.790
Well, I gotta tell you,

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:18.250
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:21.790
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.340
And this button-down,
Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.300
and then stalk from office to office

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:34.810
with an Armalite AR10 carbine
gas-powered semi-automatic weapon,

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.520
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.150
This might be someone
you've known for years.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.490
Someone very, very close to you.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.200
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.370
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:56.830
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every little piece of trash you pick up.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.380
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.420
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:15.060
What are you talking about.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:18.140
I need you to check
for a lump in my breast.

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:22.060
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to throw money on a doctor.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.070
I don't know about this, Marla.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:26.650
Please?

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.900
<i>She didn't call Tyler.
I'm neutral in her book.</i>

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:36.450
That's nice. Taking food to...
Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.500
Where are they, exactly?

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.170
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.090
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.090
Thanks for the thought.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.550
What happened to your hand?

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.430
Oh, nothing.

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.510
Right there?

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.850
- Feel anything?
- No.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.600
Well, make sure.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.110
- Okay, I'm pretty sure.
- You feel nothing?

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:07.690
No, nothing.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.950
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.870
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favour.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.330
There's not a lot of breast cancer
in the men of my family.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.160
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm okay.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.960
Well, thanks, anyway.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.220
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.510
See you... around.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.610
Cornelius?

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.280
Cornelius!

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.740
It's me! Bob!

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:00.330
Hey, Bob.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:07.420
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.420
How are you, Bob?

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.220
Better than I've ever
been in my whole life.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.220
Really? Still Remaining Men Together?

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.380
No, no.
I got something so much better now.

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:19.220
Really, what is it?

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.180
Well...

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:25.060
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.810
And the second rule is...

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:29.560
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:33.319
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.200
Look at my face, Bob.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.490
That's fucking great.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.830
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:48.040
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:50.630
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.760
Have you heard about the guy
that invented this thing?

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.550
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:00.850
Supposedly, he was born
in a mental institution

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:04.640
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:07.229
- He's a great man.
- Oh...

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:10.060
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.380
I didn't hurt you, did I?

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:40.010
Actually, you did.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.680
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.220
<i>Fight Club.</i>

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:48.020
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.520
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.109
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:57.820
Shut up!

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.620
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.710
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.880
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.390
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.260
Waiting tables.

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:28.770
Slaves with white collars.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.900
Advertising has us chasing
cars and clothes.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.440
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.490
We're the middle children of history, men.
No purpose or place.

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:48.410
We have no Great War.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
No Great Depression.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:55.130
Our great war is a spiritual war.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.880
Our great depression is our lives.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.680
We've all been raised on television to
believe that one day we'd be millionaires

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.140
and movie gods and rock stars.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.140
But we won't.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:13.190
We're slowly learning that fact.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.190
And we're very, very pissed off.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.270
Yeah!

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.780
First rule of Fight Club is,
you do not talk about...

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.120
Who are you?

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:34.790
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.550
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:43.970
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.640
Tyler Durden.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.600
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.812
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

01:11:53.883 --> 01:11:54.719
Irvine?

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:59.270
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
He don't own this place. I do.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:05.070
- How much money does he get for this?
- There is no money.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.910
- Really?
- Free to all.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.160
- Ain't that something.
- It is, actually.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.290
Look, stupid fuck!

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:17.380
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey! You should join our club.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.750
- Did you hear what I just said?
- You and your friend.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.590
You hear me now?

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.260
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.770
Still not getting it.

01:12:40.391 --> 01:12:41.570
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.110
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.740
Back! All of you!

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.700
Everybody back!

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.710
Ah, Lou!

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.550
Come on, man! We really like this place.

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:16.560
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.230
Oh, yeah!

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.860
That's fucking funny?

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.910
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.670
Unbelievable.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.550
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.090
You don't know where I've been!

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.270
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

01:13:56.350 --> 01:14:01.350
- Fucking use the basement! Christ!
- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.190
On my mother's eyes.

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.240
Thanks, Lou.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.370
You too, big guy.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.380
We'll see you next week.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.690
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:49.280
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.030
You're gonna start a fight,

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.490
and you're gonna lose.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.370
Excellent choice, sir.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.460
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.170
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.550
What... Son of a bitch!

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:18.317
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.520
Excuse me!

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.850
You sprayed me with your hose.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.440
That's not necessary.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.190
Jay! Go call 911!

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.190
Put the hose down.

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:33.780
Stop it! Stop it!

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.330
Sorry.

01:15:46.637 --> 01:15:47.717
You bastard!

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.090
We need to talk.

01:15:57.810 --> 01:15:58.970
Okay.

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:02.140
Where to begin?

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.890
With your constant absenteeism?

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.860
With your unpresentable appearance?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.690
- You're up for review.
- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.740
- What?
- Let's pretend.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.700
You're the Department
of Transportation, okay?

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:23.410
Someone informs you that this company
installs front-seat mounting brackets

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.670
that never pass collision tests,

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.920
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.840
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.680
What then?

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.640
- Are you threatening me?
- No...

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.060
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
- I have a better solution.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.560
Keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.600
and, in exchange for my salary,

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:51.570
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.110
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.450
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:09.960
- Security!
<i>- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.220
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:31.650
That hurt.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.400
Why would you do that?

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.240
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.580
What are you doing?

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:54.130
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:57.800
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:59.300
No!

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:29.000
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.960
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.960
Look. Just give me the pay cheques,
like I asked,

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.340
and you won't ever see me again.

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:41.760
<i>And right then,
at our most excellent moment together...</i>

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.890
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.430
<i>Telephone, computer, fax machine,</i>

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.730
<i>52 weekly pay cheques
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.320
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.990
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:08.160
<i>Now, nobody was the centre of Fight Club
except the two men fighting.</i>

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.210
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.460
<i>Tyler was now involved in a class
action lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:19.590
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.930
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.020
Thank you, sir.

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:43.150
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.030
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.660
- Did you know there's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.160
There's one in Penns Grove too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.960
- Yeah, did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.130
No.

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:31.890
- Stop for a second.
- What are we doing?

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.680
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:36.390
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.100
Human sacrifice.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.325
Hey! Is that a gun? Please!
Please tell me that's not a gun.

01:21:41.327 --> 01:21:43.361
It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.150
- No, no! Hey! Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.070
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.820
<i>the survival rate for everyone
drops to zero.</i>

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.500
- Stop. What are you doing come on?
- Hands behind your back.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.660
Give me your wallet.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.750
Raymond K. Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.500
Cramped basement apartment?

01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:06.582
How did you know?

01:22:06.584 --> 01:22:09.131
'Cause they give shitty basement apartments
letters instead of numbers.

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:12.930
Raymond! You're going to die.

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:14.180
No!

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:16.560
Is that your mom and dad?

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.140
Mom and dad are gonna have to call
the kindly doctor.

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:21.350
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.770
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Come on!

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:29.400
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.360
- S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:34.370
Were the midterms hard?

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.370
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.580
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:44.380
What did you wanna be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:50.300
The question, Raymond, was:
what did you want to be?

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.680
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.310
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:59.060
- Yeah. Animal and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.230
- That means that you have to get more schooling.
- Too much school.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.360
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.780
You'd rather die, here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.700
No. Please, no.

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:17.540
I'm keeping your license.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.000
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:25.080
If you're not on your way to being
a veterinarian in six weeks,

01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:26.420
you will be dead.

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.670
Now run on home.

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:37.430
Run, Forrest, run!

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:40.350
I feel ill.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.810
- Imagine how he feels.
- Come on, this isn't funny!

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:49.110
That wasn't funny. What the
fuck was the point of that?

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:52.860
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:57.410
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.950
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.290
- Come on.
<i>- He had a plan.</i>

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:06.670
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler sort of way.</i>

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.050
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:14.260
<i>The ability to let that
which does not matter truly slide.</i>

01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:29.570
<i>You are not your job.</i>

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.860
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.990
You're not the car you drive.

01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:42.330
You're not the contents of your wallet.

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:45.870
You're not your fucking khakis.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.210
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:02.310
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.980
You don't have to go.

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:07.900
Whatever.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.860
No, I mean... it's okay.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:24.660
Are you still going to groups?

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.710
Yeah.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.790
Chloe's dead.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.250
Wow. Chloe.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.300
When did that happen?

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:37.800
Do you care?

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.680
I dunno.
I haven't thought about it in a while.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.220
Yeah, well...

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.560
it was the smart move on her part.

01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.150
Listen, um...

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.770
What are you getting out of all this?

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.940
What?

01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:59.070
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
Is this making you happy?

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.910
Yeah, well, sometimes.

01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:08.500
I don't know. I don't understand.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:14.670
Why does a weaker person need to latch
on to a strong person? What is that?

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.760
What do you get out of it?

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.470
No... That's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560
"Us"?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.270
- What do you mean by "us"?
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?

01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:32.257
- Hear what?
- You're not hearing all that noise? Hold on a second.

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:35.730
No, wait! What were you saying? Don't change
the subject! I want to talk about this.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:38.610
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:39.059
What?

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:41.951
That day you came over to my place,
playing doctor. What was going on there?

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:45.410
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.490
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.087
- Look at me.
- No. What?

01:26:49.111 --> 01:26:50.259
Look at me.

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:54.210
- What is that?
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:57.210
- My God. Who did this?
- A person.

01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.710
Guy or girl?

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.430
- What do you care if it's a guy or a girl?
- What do you care if I ask?

01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:03.140
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.930
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:07.810
Let go of me. Leave me alone!

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.890
- This conversation...
- This conversation...

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.480
- ...is over.
- ...is over.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.900
I just can't win with you, can I?

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.307
Hey, this is getting a little old!

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.500
What is... What is all this?

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.330
What do you think?

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.750
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

01:27:37.495 --> 01:27:38.705
Hey!

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.890
Too young. Sorry.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.310
What's all that?

01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:54.980
Tell the applicant
if he's too young, too old or too fat.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.270
Applicant?

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.940
If the applicant then waits three days
without food or shelter,

01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:02.490
he may enter and begin his training.

01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:04.320
Training for what?

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:11.870
You think this is a game?

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.210
You're too young to train here,
end of story.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:16.880
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:24.220
Bad news, friend.

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.930
It's not gonna happen.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.970
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:32.310
It's not the end of the world.
Just... go away.

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.020
Go.

01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:39.310
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

01:28:43.349 --> 01:28:46.279
Don't you look at me! You think
you're ever getting in this house?

01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:47.781
You're never getting
in this fucking house!

01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:51.200
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.450
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.750
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.390
Got two black shirts?
Two pair of black pants?

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.510
- Yes, sir.
- One pair black boots? Two pair of black socks?

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.060
- Sir.
- One black jacket?

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.350
- Sir.
- $300 personal burial money?

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.270
Yes, sir.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.650
All right.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.410
You're too old, fat man.

01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:38.120
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.300
Bob! Bob!

01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:06.900
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:08.740
Space monkey.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.530
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.080
You are too fucking old, fatty!

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:26.000
And you... You're too fucking blond!

01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:28.550
Get out of here, the both of you!

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.590
<i>And so it went.</i>

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.430
Listen up, maggots.

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:35.430
You are not special.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.640
You are not
a beautiful or unique snowflake.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.810
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.730
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:50.030
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:53.030
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:58.120
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.830
<i>To what purpose? For what greater good?</i>

01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:07.460
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:17.510
When he was like,
"You are not your job," I was like, "Yeah!"

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.560
- Hey, what's all this?
- Hey!

01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:27.270
Okay!

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.440
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.780
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.700
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:46.420
<i>Same great taste.
Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>

01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:54.510
<i>Investigators are on the scene right now.
The Police Commissioner jacobs has just arrived.</i>

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.100
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:02.100
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>

01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:05.440
<i>somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.</i>

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.270
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:13.360
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:18.990
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago...</i>
- She's hot.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.240
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.160
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:26.880
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:35.840
What the fuck did you guys do?

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.640
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:49.310
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:59.320
The victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:04.040
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:07.750
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:11.170
- However, this is only the beginning.
- I gotta take a piss.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.590
These are the first steps
in a long journey.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.970
That is why we have
created Project Hope...

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:18.390
Bob.

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:21.640
...helping others
with prevention and enforcement.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.720
Project Hope will be a joint effort

01:33:24.810 --> 01:33:27.190
between the police
and community leaders.

01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:31.520
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

01:34:17.965 --> 01:34:22.870
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack, Bob.
- Man! His balls are ice-cold.

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:26.870
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:29.710
You're gonna publicly state that
there is no underground group

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:33.340
or these guys are gonna take your balls.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.090
They're gonna send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:41.890
Look, the people you are after
are the people you depend on.

01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:45.970
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.810
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:56.070
Do not fuck with us.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.080
Ball check!

01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:23.680
Bob, this way.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.180
Let's go.

01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:30.390
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:31.940
Hey!

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.870
Yeah!

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.490
<i>I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of
every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.450
<i>I wanted to open
the dump valves on oil tankers</i>

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:35.790
<i>and smother all those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:42.420
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.570
Where did you go, psycho boy?

01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:05.900
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.660
- Get him to a fucking hospital.
- Yeah.

01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:28.090
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.890
After you, Mr. Durden.

01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:33.680
After you.

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:54.490
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:57.330
All right, yeah. Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:01.380
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:05.050
- Why didn't you include me in the beginning?
- Fight Club was the beginning.

01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:08.340
Now it's moved out of the basements
and it's called Project Mayhem.

01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:11.300
You and I started Fight Club
together. Remember?

01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:13.140
It's as much mine as it is yours.

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:14.651
Is this about you and me?

01:38:14.653 --> 01:38:17.271
- Yeah. I thought we were doing this together.
- You're missing the point.

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:19.480
This does not belong to us.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.480
- We are not special.
- Fuck that. You should have told me.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.360
Hey, Tyler!

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:30.160
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:33.450
A statement of purpose? Should I email you?
Should I put this on your action item list?

01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:36.160
- Look...
- You decide your own level of involvement!

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:38.500
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.000
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.500
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:50.430
Forget about what you think you know
about life, about friendship,

01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:53.010
and especially about you and me.

01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:56.890
What is that supposed to mean? What...

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.350
What are you doing?

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.020
Guys, what'll you wish you'd done
before you die?

01:39:05.110 --> 01:39:07.730
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:10.610
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:12.950
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know the answer to this question!

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.830
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:20.290
I don't know! I wouldn't feel anything good about
my life. Is that what you want to hear me say?

01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:22.120
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

01:39:22.210 --> 01:39:24.380
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:29.130
Jesus Christ!

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.630
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.600
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!

01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.140
Okay, man. Okay.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.230
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:45.560
- Steer!
- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!

01:39:45.650 --> 01:39:50.280
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

01:39:51.725 --> 01:39:52.490
What?

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:56.240
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamn seminar.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.250
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.630
- Let go!
- All right. Fine.

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:08.340
Fine.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.940
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:13.230
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.450
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.450
Goddamn!

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.250
We've just had a near-life experience!

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:35.510
<i>In the world I see, you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests</i>

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:38.300
<i>around the ruins of Rockefeller Centre.</i>

01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:44.850
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:49.150
You'll climb the great thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.320
<i>And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,</i>

01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:56.240
<i>laying strips of venison</i>

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.450
<i>in the empty car-pool lane
of some abandoned superhighway.</i>

01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:15.340
Feel better, champ.

01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:35.150
<i>And then...</i>

01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:36.650
Tyler?

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.400
<i>...Tyler was gone.</i>

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.330
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:51.750
<i>Had I slept?</i>

01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:54.380
You are not a beautiful, unique
snowflake, you understand me?

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.510
<i>The house had become a living thing,</i>

01:42:57.590 --> 01:43:00.930
<i>wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:02.590
We are all part
of the same compost heap...

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.810
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.850
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:14.650
<i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:18.110
You can't be smoking in here! You know
how much ether is in this fucking house?

01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:21.030
<i>Cooking and working
and sleeping in teams.</i>

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.950
Hang on a second.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.220
It's under control, sir.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.020
Where's Tyler?

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.900
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.150
Right. Okay.

01:43:59.490 --> 01:44:00.990
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:04.950
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:07.530
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.670
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.500
<i>The second rule is
you do not ask questions.</i>

01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:25.550
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away from me!

01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:28.390
Who are all these people?

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.350
The Paper Street Soap Company.

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:39.400
Can I come in?

01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:44.200
He's not here.

01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:46.070
What?

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:50.450
Tyler isn't here.

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.700
Tyler went away.

01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:55.250
Tyler's gone.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.470
Jesus! Get some help!

01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:30.030
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:32.490
What happened? What happened?

01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.870
We were on assignment.

01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:37.040
We were supposed to kill
two birds with one stone.

01:45:37.210 --> 01:45:39.710
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:42.250
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.260
...and trash a franchise coffee bar.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.770
We had it all worked out, sir.

01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:05.990
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:08.860
- What?
- They shot Bob.

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:13.280
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:19.870
Oh, God!

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.790
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.260
You run around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:29.880
What did you think was gonna happen?

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.770
Okay, quick! We gotta get rid of the
evidence. We gotta get rid of his body!

01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:38.890
- Bury him.
- What?

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.650
Take him to the garden and bury him.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:46.610
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!

01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:48.070
What are you talking about?

01:46:48.150 --> 01:46:50.990
This isn't fucking piece of evidence.
This is a person.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.200
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.990
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.910
- This is Bob.
- But, sir, in...

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.250
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:03.670
Now, you listen to me.

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:08.260
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, okay?

01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.420
Robert Paulsen?

01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:11.840
He's a man,
and he's dead now because of us.

01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:13.760
All right? Do you understand that?

01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:16.350
I understand.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.980
In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name.

01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.900
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:29.820
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:33.320
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.870
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:40.250
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
- His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:40.532 --> 01:47:43.055
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:43.119 --> 01:47:45.822
- His name is Robert Paulsen.
- Shut up! This is all over with!

01:47:45.869 --> 01:47:47.728
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:47.814 --> 01:47:50.306
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:50.385 --> 01:47:52.830
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:52.877 --> 01:47:55.299
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.361
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.120
Tyler?

01:48:22.210 --> 01:48:24.710
No, this is Detective Stern
of the Arson Unit.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.420
<i>I need to see you in my office...</i>

01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:35.130
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.180
<i>I didn't know how, of why</i>

01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:40.350
<i>but I could look at 50 different bars,
and somehow I just knew.</i>

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:44.980
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:47.020
I wish I could help you,

01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:48.270
sir.

01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:56.450
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:00.080
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.410
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.210
Hey! Hey!

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.620
Taxi!

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.250
Look at my face. I'm a member.

01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:11.550
Now, I just need to know
if you've seen Tyler.

01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:15.260
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you,

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:19.680
nor would I, even if I had said information
you want at this juncture, be able.

01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:24.310
- You're a moron.
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:31.070
<i>Tyler had been busy,
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:37.150
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.990
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:44.370
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:49.040
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has facial reconstructive surgery every three years.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.710
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.170
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr. Durden building an army?

01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:00.140
<i>I was living in a state
of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:04.180
<i>Everywhere I went,
I felt I'd already been there.</i>

01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:07.640
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:10.980
<i>The smell of dried blood.</i>

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.980
<i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:17.990
<i>That aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.</i>

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.990
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.830
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:34.040
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His...

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.550
Welcome back, sir.

01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:41.680
How have you been?

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.350
Do you know me?

01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:47.890
- Is this a test, sir?
- No. This is not a test.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.850
You were in here last Thursday.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.650
Thursday?

01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:58.360
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.950
It's tight as a drum, sir.

01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:04.950
Who do you think I am?

01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:09.410
- Are you sure this isn't a test?
- No, this is not a test.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.630
You're Mr. Durden.

01:51:13.590 --> 01:51:15.920
You're the one who gave me this.

01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:20.720
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.020
- Yeah?
<i>- Marla, it's me.</i>

01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:36.230
- Have we ever done it?
<i>- Done what?</i>

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.400
- Have we ever had sex.
- What kind of stupid question is that?

01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:42.660
Stupid because the answer's yes
or because the answer's no?

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:44.740
- Is this a trick?
<i>- No, Marla. I need to know...</i>

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:49.330
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

01:51:49.410 --> 01:51:52.040
- We did make love?
<i>- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:55.540
Just answer the question, Marla, please!
Did we do it or not?

01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:58.380
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:01.050
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

01:52:01.130 --> 01:52:03.800
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?

01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:06.550
<i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.510
- What did you just say?
- What is wrong with you?

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:11.060
- Say my name!
- Tyler Durden.

01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:13.730
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!
What's going on?

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:15.850
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.980
You broke your promise.

01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:22.360
- Jesus, Tyler.
- You fucking talked to her about me.

01:52:22.450 --> 01:52:27.620
- Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?
- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.120
Why do people think that I'm you?

01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:32.040
Answer me!

01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:37.250
Sit.

01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:43.550
Answer me. Why do people
think that I'm you?

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:45.590
I think you know.

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.760
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

01:52:47.850 --> 01:52:50.890
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:53.980
I... I don't know.

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.360
- You got it.
- No.

01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:03.360
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.240
Because...

01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:09.240
Say it!

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.540
Because we're the same person.

01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:14.870
That's right.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.540
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing...</i>

01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:21.340
- I don't understand this.
- You were looking for a way to change your life.

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:23.630
You could not do this on your own.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.970
All the ways you wish you could be,
that's me.

01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:30.430
I look like you wanna look,
fuck like you wanna fuck,

01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:35.680
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:37.020
Oh, no.

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.270
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. Tyler's gone.
- What?

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:44.610
- This isn't possible. This is crazy.
- People do it every day.

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.660
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:52.790
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.750
Naturally, you're still wrestling with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:00.380
We should do this again sometime.

01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:03.000
Other times,
you imagine yourself watching me.

01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:05.960
If this is your first
time, you have to fight.

01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:09.720
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...

01:54:12.055 --> 01:54:12.850
Tyler Durden.

01:54:12.930 --> 01:54:16.480
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

01:54:16.890 --> 01:54:18.600
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:22.270
- You have jobs, you have a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:26.280
- Or you stay up and make soap.
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.242
Technically, you're fucking Marla.
But it's all the same to her.

01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:33.120
Oh, my God.

01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:36.040
Now you see our dilemma.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.500
She knows too much.

01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:42.630
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:47.010
What... What are you saying?

01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:51.140
This is... This is bullshit. This is bullshit!
I'm not listening to this.

01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:54.220
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:57.470
And we simply
do not have time for this crap.

01:54:59.190 --> 01:55:01.100
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:05.230
<i>The movie goes on,
and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.620
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

01:55:22.710 --> 01:55:26.170
I need you to initial
this list of phone calls, please.

01:55:29.670 --> 01:55:33.390
- When were these made?
- It says right there, sir. Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

01:55:38.850 --> 01:55:41.190
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier
every night?</i>

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:43.440
<i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.940
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.280
Is anybody here?

01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:58.200
<i>Déjà vu, all over again.</i>

01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:02.410
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

01:56:05.170 --> 01:56:06.630
Oh, my God.

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.380
<i>- 1888.</i>
- Who am I calling?

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.050
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance.</i>

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.180
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:20.890
Franklin Street?

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.020
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:29.190
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:31.900
I need to talk to your supervisor
right away.

01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:33.950
<i>- Speaking.</i>
- Okay, listen to me.

01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:37.120
I think something really terrible
is about to happen to your building.

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.160
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:43.330
- Excuse me?
<i>- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:48.420
<i>2160.</i>

01:56:56.850 --> 01:56:59.430
Marla! Marla! Hey, Marla, wait!

01:57:00.755 --> 01:57:03.890
Marla, wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.520
Your whack-out bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom!

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.310
They almost broke my arm!

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.120
They were burning
their fingertips with lye.

01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:12.009
- The stink was unbelievable.
- Look, listen to me.

01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:14.820
It'll take a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but you gotta hear me out.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:18.620
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.830
Listen, I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:27.670
You have every right to be...

01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:29.330
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:31.920
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:35.800
- Why is it free of charge?
- Don't ask.

01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:37.260
Whatever.

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.800
I'll have the clam chowder,

01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:42.220
fried chicken with a baked potato with
everything and chocolate chiffon pie.

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:44.390
Clean food, please.

01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:47.060
In that case, sir,
I advise against the clam chowder.

01:57:47.150 --> 01:57:49.270
No clam chowder. Thank you.

01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.900
You got about 30 seconds.

01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:58.740
I know I've been acting
very very strange, okay?

01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:01.580
I know that it's gotta seem
like there's two sides to me...

01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:03.740
Two sides?
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:07.494
I deserved that. But I've come to
realise something very very important.

01:58:07.548 --> 01:58:08.460
What?

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.790
The full extent of our relationship
wasn't really clear to me up until now,

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.920
for reasons I'm not gonna go into.

01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:16.420
- I know I haven't been treating you so nice.
- Whatever.

01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:20.930
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.

01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:23.600
I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.350
Because what I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.310
- You do?
- I really do.

01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:36.490
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:39.200
Marla, your life is in danger.

01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:43.870
- What?
- You need to leave town for a while.

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:46.290
Get out of any major city.
And just go camping...

01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:48.080
You're an insane person.

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:51.920
- I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.090
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

01:58:56.550 --> 01:59:00.720
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:06.060
There are things about you I like. You're
smart, you're funny, you're spectacular in bed.

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.310
But... you're intolerable.

01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:13.810
You have very serious emotional problems,
deep-seeded problems

01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:15.820
for which you should seek
professional help.

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:20.070
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry, but...

01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:23.450
I can't do this anymore.

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:26.740
I can't. I won't.

01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:29.910
I'm gone.

01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:33.080
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

01:59:36.710 --> 01:59:38.420
- Marla, wait you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:40.720
I am trying to protect you!

01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:44.090
- I don't ever want to see you again!
- If that's what it takes...

01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:46.220
Wait right here.

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.600
Hold it right there! Shut up! Shut up!

01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:57.862
Take this money and get on this bus. And I promise I
will never bother you again if that's what you want.

01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:59.230
Shut up!

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:02.280
Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus.

02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:06.660
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause they think you're some kind of a threat.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:08.870
I can't explain it right now. Trust me.

02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:10.870
If I see where you're going,
you won't be safe.

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:13.580
I'm not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.

02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:17.460
That's fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for at least a couple of days, okay?

02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:18.800
Tyler...

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:22.550
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.030
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:42.940
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:47.530
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism
and assault all over this city.

02:00:48.192 --> 02:00:51.652
In the metropolitan area, we had
probably a couple hundred members.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.080
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:59.380
This is a tightly regimented organization

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:04.010
with many cells capable of operating
completely independent of central leadership.

02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:08.850
Go to the house, okay? 1537 Paper Street.

02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:11.100
That's our headquarters.

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:16.020
In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.690
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs

02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:24.360
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

02:01:25.610 --> 02:01:28.450
I believe the plan is
to blow up the headquarters

02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:30.370
of these credit-card companies

02:01:30.450 --> 02:01:32.240
and the TRW building.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.370
Why these buildings?
Why credit-card companies?

02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:41.170
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:44.130
You'll create total chaos.

02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:49.680
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.

02:01:59.810 --> 02:02:02.230
I really admire what you're doing.

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:06.110
- What?
- You're a brave man to order this.

02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:08.860
You're a genius, sir.

02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:12.950
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.620
we gotta get his balls.

02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:20.210
- It's useless to fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:23.460
- It'll set quite an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:25.760
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.130
You told us you'd say that too.

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:30.680
All right. I am Tyler Durden.

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.390
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct
order. We're aborting this mission right now.

02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:38.190
You said you would definitely say that.

02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:41.520
Let me go!

02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:46.440
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.700
Is somebody timing this?

02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:52.584
Keep your mouth shut.

02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:53.950
Shit!

02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:00.620
- Some of this information checks out.
- Uh-huh?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.880
- Let's go over to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:06.300
Hey, wait!

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:07.710
- You got him?
- I got him.

02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:09.420
Sir, we have to do this.

02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:12.260
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:15.350
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife! Drop it!

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:21.940
Back up. Face down on the
floor, both of you, right now!

02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:25.940
Get down on the floor!

02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:34.570
First person that comes out this door
gets a lead salad! You understand?

02:03:59.430 --> 02:04:01.350
Get away! Stay away!

02:04:14.490 --> 02:04:15.660
<i>I ran.</i>

02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.040
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:25.830
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:10.380
What the fuck are you doing,
running around in your underpants?

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:12.260
Man, you look like a crazy person.

02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:15.340
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:20.220
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. it'll be like pay-per-view.

02:06:09.259 --> 02:06:10.190
Oh, Christ.

02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:12.110
Now what are you doing?

02:06:12.190 --> 02:06:14.280
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:18.610
- The greatest thing you've ever done, man.
- No, I can't let this happen.

02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:20.820
You know there are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

02:06:21.191 --> 02:06:23.540
Goddamn it! Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:26.979
The buildings are empty. Security,
maintenance, all our people.

02:06:26.981 --> 02:06:28.871
We're not killing anyone, man.
We're setting them free!

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.750
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:34.460
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.

02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:37.840
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.140
Wouldn't do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:51.190
If you know, then I know.

02:06:56.530 --> 02:07:01.360
Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.

02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:11.080
You think?

02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.960
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

02:07:15.050 --> 02:07:17.510
Pull any one but the green one.

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:25.050
I asked you not to do that!

02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:28.560
Fuck!

02:07:29.850 --> 02:07:32.060
Tyler, get away from the van.

02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:37.070
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:39.360
Goddamn it!

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.290
Okay.

02:07:47.370 --> 02:07:50.500
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:53.250
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

02:07:55.590 --> 02:07:57.670
Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.350
Aw, come on! Don't go!

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.560
What?

02:09:39.190 --> 02:09:42.730
Three minutes. This is it.

02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:45.190
The beginning.

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:46.740
Ground zero.

02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:51.450
<i>- I think this is about where we came in.</i>
- Would you like to say a few words for the occasion?

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.250
I'm sorry?

02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:57.710
I still can't think of anything.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.960
Ah. Flashback humour.

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:09.010
It's getting exciting now.

02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:13.890
Two and a half. Think of everything
we've accomplished, man.

02:10:15.810 --> 02:10:19.900
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:23.020
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:40.540
- Why is she here?
- Tying up loose ends.

02:10:41.290 --> 02:10:44.090
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:49.180
- I'm begging you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:52.260
- This is what we want.
- No. I don't want this.

02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:57.180
Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:01.020
- You're a voice in my head.
- You're a voice in mine!

02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:04.690
- You're a fucking hallucination. Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:07.110
No. I don't. I really don't anymore.

02:11:07.190 --> 02:11:11.280
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

02:11:11.490 --> 02:11:13.870
- Take some responsibility.
- I do.

02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:17.450
I am responsible for all of it,
and I accept that.

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:21.120
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

02:11:23.630 --> 02:11:25.590
Have I ever let us down?

02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:29.970
How far have you come because of me?

02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:37.520
I will bring us through this.

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.440
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming,

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:44.020
and in the end you will thank me.

02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:46.770
Tyler. Tyler.

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:50.780
I'm grateful to you
for everything that you've done for me.

02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:53.280
But this is too much. I don't want this.

02:11:53.370 --> 02:11:58.160
What do you want? You wanna go back to your shit
job? Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

02:11:58.250 --> 02:12:00.290
Fuck you! I won't do it.

02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:05.130
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

02:12:05.710 --> 02:12:09.210
- 60 seconds till CRI.
- No.

02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:13.930
I can figure this out. I can figure this out.
This isn't even real.

02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:18.100
You're not real. That gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:21.060
The gun's in my hand.

02:12:27.190 --> 02:12:29.980
Good for you. it doesn't change a thing.

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:41.000
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:43.580
Not my head, Tyler.

02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:45.290
Our head.

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:48.840
Interesting.

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.220
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:04.020
Hey. It's you and me.

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.320
Friends?

02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:12.070
Tyler,

02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:18.030
I want you to really listen to me.

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:19.740
Okay.

02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:23.580
My eyes are open.

02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:42.850
What's that smell?

02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:06.910
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:08.920
Mr. Durden!

02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:10.790
Oh, my God!

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:12.840
Sir!

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:19.470
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:23.600
- Oh, yeah, I'm okay.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:27.600
- Oh, nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:31.310
- You look really awful. You need medical assistance.
- I'm fine.

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:34.280
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:39.240
Ow! Stop it!

02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.780
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:43.870
You!

02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:46.000
Hi, Marla.

02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:51.460
- Leave her with me. Get your stuff. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:53.340
Yes, I'm sure.

02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:59.340
You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game
are you playing at, putting me on a...

02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:01.800
Oh, my God, your face!

02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:03.390
Yeah, I know.

02:15:08.850 --> 02:15:11.060
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

02:15:11.150 --> 02:15:13.110
- You're shot.
- Yes, I'm shot.

02:15:13.190 --> 02:15:15.020
Oh, my God.

02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:18.490
- I can't believe he's standing.
- Tough motherfucker.

02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:24.200
Who did this?

02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:26.370
I did, actually.

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:28.790
Find some gauze.

02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:34.710
- You shot yourself?
- Yes, but it's okay. Marla, look at me.

02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.300
I'm really okay.

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:40.800
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

02:15:54.150 --> 02:15:56.730
You met me at
a very strange time in my life.
