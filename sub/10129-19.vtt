IT BEEN SINCE ANYONE

00:26.767 --> 00:27.900
CLEANED THIS GARAGE?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.500
UGH, YEARS.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.834
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:31.834 --> 00:33.400
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.233
I AM TAKING THIS GARBAGE BAG
FULL OF GARBAGE

00:36.233 --> 00:37.300
TO THE GARBAGE.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.000
YOU ARE SO CUTE

00:39.000 --> 00:41.300
WHEN YOU TRY
AND INTIMIDATE ME.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.700
GIVE ME THE BAG.
IT'S COMING HOME WITH US.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.600
YOU ARE INCAPABLE
OF THROWING OUT ANYTHING.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.467
NO, I AM INCAPABLE OF THROWING
OUT MEMORIES FROM MY LIFE.

00:48.467 --> 00:49.800
I MEAN, LOOK AROUND YOU.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.500
THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD HERE.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.100
HEY, CORY,
YOU THINK MORGAN

00:53.100 --> 00:54.600
STILL WANTS
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE?

00:54.600 --> 00:57.500
UH, YEAH, SHE DOES.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.567
SHE'S CUTE.
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
WANT TO

01:08.400 --> 01:09.734
WANT TO THROW ALL THIS OUT.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.967
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS A GOLD MINE IN HERE.

01:11.967 --> 01:14.100
THIS IS MY OLD RETAINER.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.367
REMEMBER THIS?

01:16.367 --> 01:19.200
MMM.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
UGH, CORY,
I HATE THAT THING.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.400
AH, YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT
WHEN WE WERE 11.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.867
REMEMBER?
KISS ME.

01:24.867 --> 01:25.934
COME ON, JUST KISS ME ONCE.
NO.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.100
JUST PLEASE JUST GIVE ME ONE.
NO!

01:27.100 --> 01:29.400
ALL I REMEMBER IS TRAPPED
FOOD PARTICLES.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.734
PEANUTS, POPCORN,
CRACKER JACKS.

01:30.734 --> 01:32.567
YOUR MOUTH WAS
LIKE A BASEBALL GAME.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.000
[smacks mouth]

01:34.000 --> 01:36.567
MMM.
NACHOS.

01:36.567 --> 01:37.800
MMM.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.400
HEY, CORY,
CHECK THESE OUT.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.967
OH, MY GOSH.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.200
ERIC GAVE THOSE TO ME.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.300
YEAH, WHERE IS ERIC?

01:43.300 --> 01:44.500
YOU KNOW,
HALF THIS STUFF IS HIS.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.567
WHY ISN'T HE HELPING?

01:45.567 --> 01:47.667
WELL, LOOK,
I PROMISED MY PARENTS

01:47.667 --> 01:48.767
THAT I'D CLEAN UP THIS GARAGE
BY THE TIME

01:48.767 --> 01:51.000
THEY GOT HOME FROM VACATION,
OKAY?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.500
BESIDES, ERIC WOULD JUST
GO THROUGH ALL THIS OLD STUFF,

01:53.500 --> 01:54.667
YOU KNOW, GET ALL MUSHY,
AND NOT LET US

01:54.667 --> 01:55.967
THROW OUT ANYTHING.

01:55.967 --> 01:57.500
MMM, CAN'T HAVE THAT.
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.767
BESIDES, I'D RATHER DO IT
WITH YOU GUYS ANYWAY.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.400
DISCRIMINATION!

02:01.400 --> 02:03.133
NOT FAIR!
NOT FAIR.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.200
OH, SHAWN, LOOK.
OUR OLD CLUBHOUSE SIGN.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.834
YEAH, "NO GIRLS ALLOWED."

02:06.834 --> 02:08.400
THAT LASTED LONG.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.300
HEY, I WAS IN LOVE.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.834
AND I THREATENED TO SUE.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.100
HEY, CORY,
HOW COME WE NEVER USE THIS?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.400
OH, THIS?

02:16.400 --> 02:20.100
THIS BELONGED TO ME AND ERIC.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.834
BOY, THIS THING'S GOT
SOME MEMORIES.

02:23.834 --> 02:26.233
YOUR QUEEN DEMANDS A DUEL.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.734
LORD HUNTER.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.000
SIR COMPLAIN-A-LOT.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.100
THE WINNER SHALL
GET MY HAND.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.400
[both chuckling]

02:37.400 --> 02:39.200
EN GARDE, DOODIE-HEAD.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.767
[in Spanish accent]
PREPARE TO DIE...SCOUNDREL.

02:42.767 --> 02:45.367
OH, I'M A SCOUNDREL?

02:45.367 --> 02:48.133
THAT'S COOL.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.233
ALL RIGHT, YOUR QUEEN'S
GETTING BORED.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.567
CAN WE SEE SOME BLOODSHED?

02:50.567 --> 02:53.700
[both shouting]

02:53.700 --> 02:55.000
OH, YOU WANT ME TO HIT MY LEG?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.700
HA-HA!
DON'T EVEN TRY!

02:56.700 --> 02:58.700
STOP!

02:58.700 --> 03:01.800
SHAWN, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.300
OW!
OH.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.834
HEY, YOU GUYS HAVING
A LITTLE PARTY HERE?

03:06.834 --> 03:09.367
NO, JUST HURTING
YOUR BROTHER.

03:09.367 --> 03:10.600
WHAT YOU UP TO?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.800
WELL, APPARENTLY NOT
HAVING AS MUCH FUN

03:11.800 --> 03:13.100
AS YOU GUYS ARE.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.900
YEAH, WE'RE JUST
CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.900
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN MEANING

03:15.900 --> 03:16.934
TO GO THROUGH THIS STUFF
FOR A WHILE.

03:16.934 --> 03:18.800
OH, OKAY,
SO THIS WAS YOUR IDEA?

03:18.800 --> 03:22.233
YEAH.

03:22.233 --> 03:25.600
SHAWN AND I ARE JUST
HELPING OUT.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
YOU KNOW, CORY,
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FUN

03:29.800 --> 03:31.100
TO DO TOGETHER.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.934
OH, ERIC, COME ON.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

03:32.934 --> 03:34.767
BESIDES, I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO WASTE A SATURDAY.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.100
OH, BUT YOU DIDN'T MIND
ASKING SHAWN

03:36.100 --> 03:37.800
TO WASTE A SATURDAY?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.600
NO, SHAWN--SHAWN LOVES
THIS STUFF.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.934
REMEMBER WHERE HE'S FROM.

03:40.934 --> 03:43.700
[sighs]
I DO LOVE TRASH.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.600
OKAY, SO, ERIC,

03:48.600 --> 03:50.100
LET ME TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.800
YOU DECIDED ON YOUR OWN
TO GO THROUGH OUR STUFF,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.667
INVOLVING YOUR WIFE
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND,

03:54.667 --> 03:56.100
WHO INCIDENTALLY
HAS A BROTHER OF HIS OWN

03:56.100 --> 03:58.233
TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF WITH,
BUT YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.834
ERIC, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.000
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.400
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU GUYS STAY.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
GET A CHANCE

04:04.400 --> 04:05.767
TO SEE YOU A WHOLE LOT ANYWAY.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.300
ERIC, COME ON.
DON'T BE LIKE THIS, OKAY?

04:07.300 --> 04:08.500
STAY AND WE'LL ALL--
OH, BY THE WAY

04:08.500 --> 04:09.567
BY THE WAY,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

04:09.567 --> 04:11.100
DAD CALLED LAST NIGHT
AND HE WANTED ME

04:11.100 --> 04:13.200
AND YOU TO LOOK
FOR GRANDPA'S TOOLBOX

04:13.200 --> 04:15.100
AFTER CALLING YOU
ABOUT YOU CALLING ME

04:15.100 --> 04:17.567
ABOUT US CLEANING OUT
THE GARAGE TOGETHER.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.834
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.367
YOU KNOW,
IT MUST BE FUN

04:31.367 --> 04:32.667
TO DO A BIG CLEAN-OUT
LIKE THAT

04:32.667 --> 04:34.233
AND GO THROUGH OLD STUFF
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN YEARS.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.767
WELL, IT STARTED OUT FUN.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGELA?

04:37.133 --> 04:38.467
IT WOULDN'T HURT US
TO DO SOME SPRING CLEANING.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.367
OH, GREAT IDEA, RACHEL.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.500
WHY DON'T YOU START
AND I'LL CATCH UP

04:41.500 --> 04:43.200
WITH YOU, LIKE,
IN THE FALL?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.867
YOU KNOW, JACK,
ERIC SAID SOMETHING

04:44.867 --> 04:46.467
INTERESTING BEFORE
THAT GOT ME THINKING.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.200
WAIT A MINUTE.
ERIC GOT YOU THINKING?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.900
HE SEEMED WELL-RESTED.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.200
ANYWAY, WHEN DAD DIED,

04:51.200 --> 04:53.200
YOU AND I AGREED THAT--

04:53.200 --> 04:55.100
DEAL.
DEAL?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.100
YEAH, NO, I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.200
YOU AND I SHOULD GET CLOSER,
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER, AND

04:59.200 --> 05:01.500
START ACTING LIKE
REAL BROTHERS.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.200
SO YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING LATER?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.033
HOW ABOUT NOW?
I'M UP FOR ANYTHING.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.500
SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.834
I'M HAVING FUN ALREADY.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.867
HEY.
HEY, HEY.

05:10.867 --> 05:14.200
SO WHY EXACTLY DON'T YOU
WANT TO CLEAN WITH ME?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.900
OH, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T WANT TO.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.200
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M NOT GOING TO.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.000
I HAVE THEORIES,
YOU KNOW?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.367
ABOUT WHAT?

05:23.367 --> 05:25.900
I DON'T KNOW.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.767
SHAWN, I WANT TO SAY
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.000
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST--
I WAS UPSET.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.834
IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.700
all: IT'S COMING IN NICE.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.767
HEY, ERIC,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.600
WELL, YOU FOUND ME.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.033
UH, LISTEN, I JUST WANT
TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT BEFORE.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.500
YOU KNOW, THE REASON
I DIDN'T CALL YOU

05:49.500 --> 05:51.233
WAS NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO BE THERE.

05:51.233 --> 05:53.100
I'M LISTENING.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.100
BECAUSE THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.834
OKAY, SO WHAT
WERE YOU THINKING?

05:56.834 --> 06:00.133
WELL, I WASN'T REALLY
THINKING ANYTHING.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.100
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.867
I MEAN, MAYBE WE'LL
DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.700
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.967
OKAY.

06:08.967 --> 06:12.500
SO THEN WHY
ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

06:12.500 --> 06:17.400
UH, WELL,
I'M APOLOGIZING BECAUSE...

06:17.400 --> 06:19.967
YOU SEEMED HURT.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.834
THAT'S VERY CONSIDERATE.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.934
NO PROBLEM.

06:23.934 --> 06:26.867
ARE YOU REALLY SORRY
OR ARE YOU

06:26.867 --> 06:28.033
JUST SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT?

06:29.600 --> 06:33.300
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE DOES SEEM WELL-RESTED.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.700
ERIC, COME ON.
THIS IS STUPID, ALL RIGHT?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.000
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
YOU KNOW?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.834
WE'LL GO HOME,
FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED,

06:39.834 --> 06:41.500
WE'LL CLEAN OUT THE GARAGE,
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.500
OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:43.500 --> 06:44.934
WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T WE JUST

06:44.934 --> 06:47.600
MOVE ALL THAT CRAP TO THE END
OF THE DRIVEWAY AND SELL IT?

06:47.600 --> 06:50.233
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE A GARAGE SALE?

06:50.233 --> 06:53.000
I MEAN, THAT'S--
THAT'S, LIKE, OUR CHILDHOOD.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.934
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I MEAN, LIKE YOU SAID,

06:54.934 --> 06:56.100
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.367
WHY DON'T WE JUST SELL IT,
SPLIT THE MONEY

06:57.367 --> 06:58.900
RIGHT DOWN THE CENTER,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

06:58.900 --> 07:00.066
WE CAN BE DONE WITH IT,

07:00.066 --> 07:01.300
GO BACK TO THE WAY
IT USED TO BE, YOU KNOW?

07:01.300 --> 07:02.700
"HEY, HOW YOU DOING?"
"FINE, HOW YOU DOING?"

07:02.700 --> 07:05.600
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR ANYTHING.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.600
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.200
PERFECT!

07:22.200 --> 07:23.667
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

07:23.667 --> 07:24.767
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M SO GLAD

07:24.767 --> 07:26.100
WE ARE FINALLY DOING THIS.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.600
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SEE?

07:27.600 --> 07:30.100
ANYTHING, MAN, AS LONG
AS WE'RE TOGETHER, BUDDY.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.734
UH, YOU MIND SUBTITLES?

07:31.734 --> 07:35.400
YOU MEAN LIKE
A FOREIGN MOVIE?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.967
I KNOW.
BOWLING.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.100
BOWLING?

07:39.100 --> 07:40.867
[chuckles]

07:40.867 --> 07:44.500
DID YOU EVER SMELL
THOSE RENTAL SHOES?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.233
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

07:46.233 --> 07:47.834
NO, I JUST ATE.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.700
I COULD WATCH YOU EAT.

07:49.700 --> 07:54.934
MAYBE WE'RE TRYING TOO HARD,
YOU KNOW?

07:54.934 --> 07:56.200
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO WORK OUT?

07:56.200 --> 07:59.400
I DON'T DO THAT.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.367
YOU LIKE POETRY?

08:06.367 --> 08:09.834
I LIKE RIDDLES.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.934
THE MALL.
THE BANK.

08:11.934 --> 08:14.867
THE BANK?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.100
I WONDER HOW
THE GARAGE SALE'S GOING.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.600
YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.400
YES!
HO-HO!

08:26.400 --> 08:28.767
MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.000
I AM LOVING IT.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.367
YOU'RE GONNA SELL THAT SLED?

09:06.367 --> 09:08.967
YEAH, WHY NOT?

09:08.967 --> 09:11.233
WELL, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN
ON THAT SLED.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.800
YEAH, WE DID.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.967
YOU THINK 2 BUCKS?

09:14.967 --> 09:16.800
[scoffs]
YEAH.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.100
2 BUCKS.

09:23.734 --> 09:26.867
BOY, YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
WHEN WE, UH

09:26.867 --> 09:28.700
WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS CLOSED DOWN
FOR TWO DAYS

09:28.700 --> 09:31.400
AND WE TOOK THIS UP
TO DEAD MAN'S HILL?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.367
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.033
YEAH.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.200
AND THEN WE, UH

09:37.200 --> 09:38.700
WE WERE SLIDING DOWN
THAT HILL SO FAST,

09:38.700 --> 09:41.000
WE COULDN'T STOP AND WE CAUSED
A FOUR-CAR PILE-UP.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.567
YEAH, DAD WAS REALLY MAD.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.400
LOCKED US IN OUR ROOM
FOR TWO WEEKS.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.567
YEAH, BUT, IT WAS
A LOT OF FUN, HUH?

09:50.934 --> 09:52.867
BUCK 50.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.233
HEY, GUYS.
HEY.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.800
WOW, THIS LOOKS GREAT.
THANKS.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.000
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
WELL, ANGELA AND I DECIDED
IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
TO CLEAN OUT OUR ROOM.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.400
YEAH, AND GUESS WHAT?
IT WASN'T.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.567
WELL, ANYWAY,
WE FOUND A LOT OF GREAT STUFF.

10:17.567 --> 10:18.900
LOOK.
OH, GOSH.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.300
OH, HEY, LOOK AT ALL
THAT STUFF.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.500
THAT'S GREAT.
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB A TABLE?

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE.
OKAY.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.734
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.867
THIS IS MY PURSE.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.000
ANGELA, IT'S BEEN
ON THE FLOOR FOR THREE MONTHS.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.400
$1.72?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.500
OOH, I'LL TAKE IT.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
THANKS.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.934
RACHEL...

10:34.934 --> 10:36.000
DID YOU WEAR THIS?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.967
I USED TO.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.600
I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
FOR 'EM.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.100
SOLD.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.834
WHY DO YOU WANT RACHEL'S
OLD TANK-TOP?

10:43.834 --> 10:48.767
I'M A COLLECTOR.

10:48.767 --> 10:51.300
HEY, ERIC.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.100
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO SELL MY GLOVE.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.100
THAT'S MY GLOVE.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.700
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.200
YEAH, NOW I'M TAKING IT BACK.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.133
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.667
IT'S A GARAGE SALE, COR.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.800
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE JUST
SELL IT?

11:01.800 --> 11:02.800
YOU DON'T USE IT.
I DON'T USE IT.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.500
LET'S JUST BE DONE WITH IT.

11:05.500 --> 11:10.467
[laughter]

11:10.467 --> 11:11.600
OH, THIS--

11:11.600 --> 11:13.834
THIS GUY.
HE'S FUNNY.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.600
[laughter]

11:15.600 --> 11:16.734
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
OH, MAN.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.133
OH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
YOU KNOW?

11:18.133 --> 11:19.200
IT'S JUST WE'VE BEEN LAUGHING
FOR, LIKE,

11:19.200 --> 11:21.500
THE LAST THREE HOURS.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.700
ERIC AND I HAVE BEEN DOING
THE SAME THING.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.100
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN UP TO?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.600
OH, LITTLE OF THIS,
A LITTLE OF THAT.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.133
AND TIME'S JUST BEEN FLYING.
FLYING. RIGHT, BUD.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.233
UP HIGH. UP HIGH.
OH!

11:30.233 --> 11:31.367
YEAH!
YEAH!

11:31.367 --> 11:32.734
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.834
OH, MAN, HELP ME OUT HERE.

11:33.834 --> 11:34.900
I AM DYING.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.500
HE IS SO FREAKING BORING.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.300
TAKE ME OUT OF THIS MISERY,
MAN.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.200
YOU GOT ANY GUNS FOR SALE?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.600
EXCUSE ME,
HOW MUCH ARE THESE?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.900
I DIDN'T KNOW THOSE
WERE FOR SALE.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.834
I'LL GIVE YOU 5 BUCKS
FOR 'EM.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.000
I'LL GIVE YOU 20.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.867
OKAY.
OKAY!

11:55.300 --> 11:58.300
[sighs]

11:58.300 --> 11:59.900
ERIC, COME ON.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.500
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A JERK?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.400
EXCUSE ME, HONEY.
HOW MUCH IS THIS FRAME?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.934
JUST ONE SECOND.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.567
LOOK, ERIC, I'VE APOLOGIZED
100 TIMES, ALL RIGHT?

12:07.567 --> 12:10.133
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
NOTHING.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.500
IT COULDN'T BE VERY MUCH,
'CAUSE THERE'S A SCRATCH ON IT.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.600
LADY, JUST ONE SECOND,
OKAY?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.133
I CAN'T WAIT HERE FOREVER.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.300
LADY, PLEASE.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.000
ERIC, I'M NOT A MIND-READER,
OKAY?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.734
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

12:19.734 --> 12:20.867
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SELL ANYTHING

12:20.867 --> 12:22.400
IF YOU IGNORE THE CUSTOMERS.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.133
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE ANNOYING?

12:26.133 --> 12:28.600
HEY, BUDDY,
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
THAT'S MY WIFE.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.767
COULD SHE BE
ANY MORE ANNOYING?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.867
[grunts]

12:37.867 --> 12:39.734
THAT'S MY BROTHER!

12:39.734 --> 12:44.567
NOBODY HITS MY BROTHER!

12:44.567 --> 12:47.700
SO THIS GUY WALKS INTO A BAR.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.467
HEY!
[grunts]

12:49.467 --> 12:50.667
THAT'S MY BROTHER!

12:50.667 --> 12:52.133
GET OFF HIM!

12:52.133 --> 12:53.934
THAT'S--AH!

12:53.934 --> 12:58.934
[overlapping shouting]

13:09.967 --> 13:11.300
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO, UH

13:11.300 --> 13:12.500
I'M GONNA HANG OUT HERE
JUST TO MAKE SURE

13:12.500 --> 13:13.834
EVERYTHING WORKS OUT OKAY.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.767
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.133
I'M GONNA GO GET COFFEE
FROM THE CAFETERIA.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.100
[clears throat]

13:37.100 --> 13:40.467
HOW'S THE ARM?

13:40.467 --> 13:43.100
WELL, I WON'T BE USING THAT
CATCHER'S MITT ANYTIME SOON.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.033
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE I SOLD IT FOR A DIME.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.300
[scoffs]

13:48.300 --> 13:52.600
ERIC, UH...

13:52.600 --> 13:55.700
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAY
YOU HAD MY BACK TODAY.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.300
YOU KNOW, AND THANKS FOR WAITING
WITH ME HERE TOO.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.600
IT'S OKAY.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.100
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY,
YOU KNOW?

14:02.100 --> 14:05.467
I MEAN, BECAUSE...
YOU'RE MY BROTHER,

14:05.467 --> 14:07.667
AND TODAY YOU REMINDED ME
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

14:07.667 --> 14:09.400
TO HAVE A BIG BROTHER
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU

14:09.400 --> 14:12.867
AND I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I'D BE THERE FOR YOU TOO.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.400
I'M SURE YOU WOULD.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.300
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BEING
BROTHERS IS ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.500
BEING THERE FOR EACH OTHER
WHEN ONE OF US IS IN TROUBLE.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.400
YEAH, AS LONG AS WE DON'T
HAVE TO SEE EACH OTHER

14:21.400 --> 14:24.000
IN BETWEEN, RIGHT?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
WHAT?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
WELL, WHAT ABOUT WHEN
WE'RE NOT IN TROUBLE, COR?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
WELL, WE CAN DO STUFF.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.100
I DON'T KNOW.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.600
TODAY WAS A PRETTY BIG DAY,
YOU KNOW?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.700
A GARAGE SALE,
A FIST FIGHT,

14:37.700 --> 14:39.100
ENDED UP HERE
AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.767
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN COUNT ON
THIS KIND OF THING

14:40.767 --> 14:42.400
HAPPENING ALL THE TIME.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.567
ERIC...

14:45.567 --> 14:48.300
LOOK, I'M REALLY TRYING HERE,
OKAY?

14:48.300 --> 14:51.834
I JUST WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE ALL RIGHT WITH US.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.200
BIG BROTHER,
LITTLE BROTHER.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.367
I GOT YOUR BACK.
YOU GOT MINE.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.367
IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.800
DAMN IT, ERIC.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.033
IS THIS ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T
LET YOU CLEAN OUT

14:58.033 --> 15:00.066
THE STUPID GARAGE?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.700
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,
OKAY?

15:01.700 --> 15:04.500
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.000
WHAT?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.233
LOOK, IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE GARAGE, OKAY?

15:08.233 --> 15:09.500
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU SHUT ME OUT

15:09.500 --> 15:11.100
OF YOUR LIFE A LONG TIME AGO.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.300
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S--

15:12.300 --> 15:13.800
OH, WELL, LET'S LOOK
AT IT THIS WAY.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.500
WE USED TO DO STUFF TOGETHER
AND NOW WE DON'T.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.133
YEAH, WE DO.
WHEN?

15:17.133 --> 15:20.033
WE--WE JUST SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY TOGETHER.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.300
TODAY?

15:21.300 --> 15:22.600
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.834
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I TAKE IT BACK.

15:23.834 --> 15:26.033
IT IS ABOUT CLEANING OUT
THE STUPID GARAGE.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.600
DAD WANTED US
TO DO THAT TOGETHER

15:27.600 --> 15:29.700
AND YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE ME OUT.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.300
THOSE ARE OUR MEMORIES!

15:32.300 --> 15:33.734
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW IT FELT

15:33.734 --> 15:35.667
TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE
SHAWN AND TOPANGA THERE

15:35.667 --> 15:38.800
INSTEAD OF ME?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.367
LOOK, ERIC...
WE'RE BROTHERS, OKAY?

15:41.367 --> 15:42.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:42.667 --> 15:43.934
NO, WE'RE BROTHERS.

15:43.934 --> 15:45.700
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.667
NO, IT MEANS YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LIKE ME AND YOU DON'T.

15:48.667 --> 15:51.600
OH.
[sighs]

15:51.600 --> 15:56.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:56.300 --> 15:58.300
[sighs]

16:24.000 --> 16:27.600
LOOK AT THIS.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.934
[sighs]

16:29.934 --> 16:33.834
SO MANY DAYS SPENT TRYING
TO MASTER THIS...

16:33.834 --> 16:36.800
AND THEN THAT MAGICAL DAY
WHEN EVERYTHING CLICKED.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.000
"GO, ERIC.
STAY UP THERE.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.700
YOU CAN DO IT."

16:40.700 --> 16:43.867
YOU GUYS DID A LOT OF THINGS
TOGETHER.

16:43.867 --> 16:47.000
YEAH, WE DID.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.900
BUT...
[sighs]

16:48.900 --> 16:51.500
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.867
I MADE YOU A SANDWICH.
THANKS.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.500
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO HELP?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.967
NO.

16:56.967 --> 17:00.867
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INTO TROUBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.400
[sighs]

17:03.400 --> 17:05.467
AM I WRONG HERE?

17:05.467 --> 17:07.400
I MEAN, IF I DID SOMETHING
WRONG, TELL ME.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.600
WELL, I--

17:08.600 --> 17:09.767
I MEAN, I'VE REALIZED
THAT I AM NOT

17:09.767 --> 17:11.000
THE PERFECT BROTHER,
OKAY?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.233
BUT NEITHER IS HE.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.367
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT ERIC HERE.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.600
YES, WE ARE.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.767
THE GUY'S A TOTAL SCREW-UP.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.100
I MEAN, WE SPENT
OUR WEDDING NIGHT

17:17.100 --> 17:18.233
IN JAIL BECAUSE OF HIM.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.500
REMEMBER?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.033
WHAT I REMEMBER
IS HAVING

17:21.033 --> 17:22.567
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING
WEDDINGS

17:22.567 --> 17:25.033
IN THE BEST HOTEL
IN PHILADELPHIA BECAUSE OF HIM.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.500
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE STILL KIDS ANYMORE.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.567
I MEAN, WE'RE ADULTS NOW.

17:28.567 --> 17:29.934
WE HAVE OUR OWN LIVES.

17:29.934 --> 17:32.600
LET HIM GET A WIFE AND TRY
AND KEEP UP WITH EVERYBODY.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.200
HMM.
YOU LIKE THAT CAST?

17:34.200 --> 17:36.300
YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

17:36.300 --> 17:39.100
LOOK, I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD POSSIBLY DO

17:39.100 --> 17:40.934
TO TRY AND PATCH THINGS UP,
OKAY?

17:40.934 --> 17:44.300
AND HE REJECTED ME
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.600
HE'S THE ONE THAT
SOLD OUR MEMORIES.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.800
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.834
WE'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, TOPANGA.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.667
AND BESIDES,
WHERE IS IT WRITTEN

17:53.667 --> 17:58.767
THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

17:58.767 --> 18:02.934
I REMEMBER WHEN THAT'S ALL
YOU WANTED TO DO.

18:02.934 --> 18:05.300
I WAS JEALOUS.

18:05.300 --> 18:08.200
SHAWN WAS TOO.

18:13.500 --> 18:17.667
IT'S EASIER
WHEN YOU'RE KIDS,
YOU KNOW?

18:17.667 --> 18:20.500
I MEAN, I WAS THERE.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.400
HE WAS THERE.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.500
YOU HOP ON A SLED
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

18:24.500 --> 18:28.133
YOU'RE LAUGHING
AT AN INTERSECTION.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.867
I MEAN,
TIME GOES BY AND...

18:30.867 --> 18:35.000
SOMEHOW WHAT YOU HAD JUST
SORT OF FADES AWAY.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.667
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK.

18:38.667 --> 18:43.600
YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
TO MAKE NEW MEMORIES.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.767
THE QUESTION NOW IS JUST:
DO YOU WANT TO?

18:50.367 --> 18:52.667
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME?

18:52.667 --> 18:54.600
[silently]
OKAY.
