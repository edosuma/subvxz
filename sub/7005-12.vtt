00:01.600 --> 00:05.069
<i>(sleigh bells jingle)</i>

00:05.070 --> 00:07.104
Does everybody know
what time it is?

00:07.105 --> 00:08.773
<i>(all) tool time!</i>

00:08.774 --> 00:10.808
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

00:10.809 --> 00:14.479
Tim "the tool man" taylor!
Whoo!

00:23.923 --> 00:25.923
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everyone.

00:25.924 --> 00:27.825
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:27.826 --> 00:32.397
And you all know my assistant
al "be quarantined
for christmas" borland.

00:32.398 --> 00:36.368
Today, al and I start on
our week-long salute...

00:36.369 --> 00:37.568
<i>(electricity surges)</i>

00:37.569 --> 00:39.471
...To electricity.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.806
That's right,
and that's why
we're wearing

00:41.807 --> 00:45.610
The flash suits
worn by professional
electricians.

00:45.611 --> 00:49.080
You can
take up to 20,000 volts
and not get electrocuted.

00:49.081 --> 00:50.382
Yeah. But, al...

00:53.119 --> 00:55.953
But they look so darn cool,
don't they?

00:55.954 --> 00:59.991
It's like
the '90s way of saying,
"hey, I'm not gonna get fried."

01:02.528 --> 01:05.429
Notice tim's
flame-resistant parka

01:05.430 --> 01:10.134
And color-coordinated
insulated gloves.

01:11.971 --> 01:15.540
It boasts a safety helmet
with uv face shield,

01:15.541 --> 01:20.144
And is
tastefully accessorized
by this matching tote bag.

01:20.145 --> 01:22.413
You might
want to wear these

01:22.414 --> 01:25.016
When you put up
your christmas lights
this weekend.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.023
Actually, I'm way ahead of you.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.993
With this outfit,
I can safely replace
my measly seven-watt bulbs

01:34.994 --> 01:37.896
With these 500-watt bad boys
right here, huh?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.300
You could light up
an airport runway

01:42.301 --> 01:45.036
With that much
wattage on your roof.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.839
Well, maybe it's time
for old st. Nick to trade in
that old sleigh

01:47.840 --> 01:52.711
For the new boeing 777
fly-by-wire.

01:52.712 --> 01:56.148
Tim, where are you gonna
get enough juice to run
something like this?

01:56.149 --> 02:01.219
Can you believe
he asked the tool man that?
Heidi, my generator, please.

02:04.957 --> 02:06.391
Here you go, tim.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.925
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.931
You want to plug it in
for me, al?

02:16.201 --> 02:18.336
I don't think so, tim.

02:18.337 --> 02:20.972
Ok, then I'll do it.

02:26.211 --> 02:28.146
All right, heidi,
hit the switch!

02:33.218 --> 02:37.689
All right, tim. That's enough.
Tim? Turn it off!

02:37.690 --> 02:41.393
Oh, heidi, get that switch.
Turn it off, tim!

02:41.394 --> 02:43.094
Turn it off! Oh!

02:43.095 --> 02:46.431
That was a lot brighter
than I thought it was
gonna be, al.

02:49.268 --> 02:51.902
Yes, it was, tim.

03:45.957 --> 03:48.393
All right. Great news, guys.

03:48.394 --> 03:52.730
This year, you're gonna
help me beat doc johnson
in the lighting contest.

03:52.731 --> 03:55.766
Cool.
I can't believe
you're letting us help.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.237
Well, you've earned it.

03:59.238 --> 04:02.574
You're a year older,
more mature,
more responsible.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.876
Since you're going out of town,
you have no choice.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.610
Hey, hey, hey.

04:06.611 --> 04:09.247
What have I always taught you
what christmas is all about?

04:09.248 --> 04:13.785
Beating the pants off
an 80-year-old proctologist
in a lighting contest.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.488
That's the spirit.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.656
Will we get to
put up the manger?

04:18.658 --> 04:21.692
No. I'll put up the manger
when I get home.
That's my specialty.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.329
Last year, your specialty
fell through the roof.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.832
I got the quirks
worked out. All right?

04:27.833 --> 04:31.035
Got the generator,
string of lights from work.
They're set up there.

04:31.036 --> 04:34.772
If any more electrical work
needs to be done,
I want brad to do it.

04:34.773 --> 04:37.274
How come he gets to do it?
'cause he's the oldest.

04:41.546 --> 04:44.215
And I'm the only one that
can fit into dad's suit.

04:44.216 --> 04:47.484
Aren't you supposed
to be getting ready
to go to the airport?

04:47.485 --> 04:49.487
I am ready.
I'm just waiting for al.

04:49.488 --> 04:53.190
I just don't understand
why you have to go away
the day before christmas.

04:53.191 --> 04:55.025
We've been
through this before.

04:55.026 --> 04:57.128
Binford is the proud sponsor
of this year's winterfest
in kinross,

04:57.129 --> 05:00.030
And al and I play
very important roles.

05:00.031 --> 05:04.135
Tim, you are a grand marshal
of an elf parade!

05:08.741 --> 05:13.011
Even little green people
need a leader, honey.

05:13.012 --> 05:17.582
Well, I don't know
how you can leave me
for a bunch of elves.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.319
I'll be home before dinner.
I'm not gonna go to
the pointy-shoe banquet.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.687
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:25.290 --> 05:27.725
Hi, ilene! Hi, al!
Merry christmas!

05:27.726 --> 05:29.794
Hi, ilene.
Hi, jill.

05:29.795 --> 05:33.097
I brought the ingredients
to make my famous
pfeffernusse cookies.

05:33.098 --> 05:35.399
Wait till you get your hands
on ilene's pfeffernusse.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.435
I'd like to, but I'm
a one-pfeffernusse guy.

05:38.436 --> 05:39.771
<i>(beeping)</i>

05:39.772 --> 05:42.107
Oh, that's my beeper.
I wonder who that is.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.308
<i>(all)</i> your mother.

05:45.644 --> 05:47.779
Can I use your phone?
<i>(jill)</i> yeah, sure.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.981
That's the fourth time
she's beeped him
this morning.

05:50.982 --> 05:54.718
I can imagine al's mother
would put stress
on any relationship.

05:54.719 --> 05:58.556
Al's mother could put stress
on a 20-ton steel beam.

05:58.557 --> 06:02.827
I'm so glad she's
visiting his brother
for the holidays.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.029
We'll finally be alone
on new year's eve.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.098
Al booked us
a romantic weekend

06:07.099 --> 06:09.701
At the hotel trentwood.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.671
You're coming back early?
New year's eve?

06:13.672 --> 06:17.776
No. Ilene and I aren't
doing anything special.
No, we'd love to have you.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.444
Ok, great!

06:19.445 --> 06:22.914
Al, I can't believe you!

06:22.915 --> 06:25.983
I thought we were gonna
be alone for a change.

06:25.984 --> 06:29.887
Once again, your mother
has to wedge herself
between us.

06:29.888 --> 06:32.723
That's a hell of a big wedge.
Tim!

06:32.724 --> 06:36.494
Help me fix the fire,
and we'll let them
work this out.

06:36.495 --> 06:38.763
Al, we're in a hurry.
Shh.

06:38.764 --> 06:42.400
You know, ilene,
I resent your attitude
towards my mother.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.469
She's a wonderful
giving woman

06:44.470 --> 06:46.905
Who lights up
all the lives she touches.

06:46.906 --> 06:52.243
Oh, please! I am so sick of you
putting your mother
up on a pedestal.

06:52.244 --> 06:56.147
You got to admire him
for having the strength
to hoist her up there.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.624
Oh, my god.
I'm turning into you.

07:08.661 --> 07:12.597
It's kind of fun,
isn't it?

07:12.598 --> 07:15.533
You know, and that's
another reason

07:15.534 --> 07:17.668
Why ilene
shouldn't be upset

07:17.669 --> 07:20.304
At mother joining us
for new year's.

07:20.305 --> 07:22.473
You know, after
a couple of rob roys,

07:22.474 --> 07:26.677
Mother can be
quite the party animal.

07:26.678 --> 07:28.546
Here are your drinks.

07:28.547 --> 07:31.316
One ginger ale,
one martini -

07:31.317 --> 07:33.718
Double olives
on the side.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.486
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

07:37.622 --> 07:40.691
Oh, I suppose mother
can be needy, but...

07:42.895 --> 07:46.764
...How can I turn my back
on the woman who nurtured me
from the womb?

07:54.539 --> 07:57.074
I'm just thankful that
I have a friend like you

07:57.075 --> 07:59.043
That will lend me
a supportive ear...

08:03.749 --> 08:06.317
That has
a green olive in it!

08:06.318 --> 08:09.153
This just means the barf bag
wasn't big enough

08:09.154 --> 08:11.555
To fit over my head.

08:11.556 --> 08:14.559
I don't why ilene
is acting like this.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.896
Oh, god, maybe the plane
will crash.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.665
I have a good mind
not to give ilene
her christmas present.

08:20.666 --> 08:24.135
And I had a necklace
made especially for her

08:24.136 --> 08:26.237
Out of coins
that she collected

08:26.238 --> 08:31.175
When she went to stockholm
for the gingivitis symposium.

08:31.176 --> 08:35.346
You gave her spare change
from a bloody-gum convention?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.582
Yes. I'm sure it was
a more thoughtful gift

08:38.583 --> 08:42.285
Than what you got jill,
if you got her anything.

08:42.287 --> 08:44.355
You couldn't be further
from the truth.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.725
Why do you think
I volunteered to lead
an elf parade in kinross?

08:47.726 --> 08:50.027
Same reason as me -
the prestige.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.899
No. Her gift is up there.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.435
Kinross has one of the best
specialty bookstores
in michigan.

08:57.436 --> 09:00.104
I ordered a book.
It didn't come in time
to deliver by christmas,

09:00.105 --> 09:02.106
So I gotta go get it.

09:02.107 --> 09:03.207
What did you order?

09:03.208 --> 09:04.975
A first edition -
freud's essays.

09:04.976 --> 09:07.578
She'll love this.
It'll be a christmas
she never forgets.

09:07.579 --> 09:09.614
<i>(pilot)</i>
<i>attention, passengers,</i>

09:09.615 --> 09:12.883
<i>The kinross airport's</i>
<i>been closed due to</i>
<i>heavy storm activity.</i>

09:12.884 --> 09:16.887
<i>This flight will be</i>
<i>diverted to alpena.</i>

09:16.888 --> 09:18.823
<i>(passengers moan)</i>

09:33.772 --> 09:36.240
Excuse me. Could you tell us
where the main terminal is?

09:39.478 --> 09:41.946
Take two giant steps
forward.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.624
Is there still a chance
we can make it to kinross?

09:53.625 --> 09:55.426
I don't see how.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.828
There'll be no more
flights in or out
until the storm's over.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.964
But this is an emergency!

09:59.965 --> 10:03.835
The hospital has
a special helicopter.
What's the emergency?

10:03.836 --> 10:06.337
We're leading
an elf parade.

10:09.341 --> 10:13.044
Try me again
when you're
donating a kidney.

10:13.045 --> 10:16.414
We really have to get there.
Is there a car-rental
counter here?

10:16.415 --> 10:18.015
Of course.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.256
Now, what kind of car
would you like?

10:26.257 --> 10:29.026
We're running a special
on convertibles.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.065
It's 4 degrees outside.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.134
Then I'd advise you
to leave the top up.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.139
Could you give us a map
so we could find our way
to kinross?

10:42.140 --> 10:44.308
No problem.

10:44.309 --> 10:47.144
I don't think the map
is going to do you
much good.

10:47.145 --> 10:50.515
Why not?
The roads are closed.

10:50.516 --> 10:54.152
Well, why are we renting a car
if we can't drive it anywhere?

10:54.153 --> 10:57.754
I was wondering
the same thing myself.

11:01.192 --> 11:05.696
This is just great.
Stuck here in the airport,
and jill's gift is in kinross.

11:05.697 --> 11:07.832
Is there anyplace
I can look for a book here?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.967
We have some books
in our gift shop.

11:09.968 --> 11:12.269
And the gift shop
would be...?

11:18.977 --> 11:21.045
Ok, can I see
some of your books?

11:21.046 --> 11:24.147
Sorry. We're closed
for the holidays.

11:34.492 --> 11:36.894
There's no way we'll make it
to the elf parade.

11:36.895 --> 11:39.897
So we're trying to get a plane
back to detroit as soon as
the storm clears here.

11:39.898 --> 11:42.333
I knew this would happen.
You'll miss christmas eve!

11:42.334 --> 11:44.701
I've never missed
a christmas eve, and tonight's
not gonna be the night.

11:44.702 --> 11:46.771
Whatever it takes,
I'm getting home.

11:46.772 --> 11:51.042
Well, I hope so. The boys
will be really disappointed
when I tell them.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.943
Wait. Hold on a second.
Guys, it's your father.

11:52.944 --> 11:55.879
He's stranded in the middle
of nowhere. He may not
make it back tonight.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.616
<i>(all)</i> all right! Cool!

11:58.617 --> 12:00.918
Wait a second!

12:00.919 --> 12:03.154
You don't want to see
your father on christmas eve?

12:03.155 --> 12:06.324
It's not that. We just want
to do the lighting contest
by ourselves.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.359
<i>(tim) what's going on?</i>

12:08.360 --> 12:12.997
The boys are crushed.
I'm trying to comfort them.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.566
Put randy on the phone.
Tim, I need to talk to ilene.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.902
Hold on. I gotta tell randy
how to put the runway lights
on the manger.

12:18.903 --> 12:20.771
This is more important.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.309
Put ilene on the phone,
please.

12:28.847 --> 12:30.181
Sugar pumpkin?

12:30.182 --> 12:33.217
No, sweet pea.
I'll get sugar pumpkin.

12:35.053 --> 12:36.454
Al?

12:36.455 --> 12:38.655
I think I have a solution
for new year's eve

12:38.656 --> 12:40.824
That's gonna make
everybody happy.

12:40.825 --> 12:42.826
<i>You do?</i>
Yes.

12:42.827 --> 12:45.096
Mother rings in
the new year's with us,

12:45.097 --> 12:48.232
But then we put her in a cab,
and we have the weekend
to ourselves.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.667
Al, you are missing
the whole point.

12:50.668 --> 12:53.070
You are 37 years old.

12:53.071 --> 12:55.907
Don't you think it's time
to cut the cord?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.074
Cut the cord?

12:57.075 --> 12:59.343
Cut the cord?!
Don't cut the cord.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.245
It's the only extension cord
that'll handle those lights.

13:01.246 --> 13:03.280
This is not about
your stupid lights!

13:03.281 --> 13:05.583
My relationship
is hanging in the balance!

13:05.584 --> 13:07.852
So the extension cord's ok?

13:07.853 --> 13:10.721
Al, you are gonna
have to make a choice.

13:10.722 --> 13:13.958
It is either me
or your mother.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.996
Ilene hung up.

13:20.298 --> 13:22.633
There's got to be some way
out of here. Something else.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.267
How about a snowmobile?

13:24.268 --> 13:26.003
That would work...
Ok.

13:26.004 --> 13:28.773
...If we had one.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.008
How about a dog sled?

13:31.009 --> 13:33.944
I've got a dog,
and my grandson has a sled.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.012
Perfect.

13:35.013 --> 13:37.347
Of course,
my dog's a poodle.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.123
Good. Thank you.

13:46.124 --> 13:49.460
I got some good news.
The storm has let up
in kinross.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.661
All right.
Great!

13:50.662 --> 13:54.598
Unfortunately,
it's getting worse here.

13:54.599 --> 13:57.335
In fact, it might not let up
for a couple of days.

13:57.336 --> 14:01.572
We'll have to sleep here
in the airport?
There are some hotels in town.

14:01.573 --> 14:03.641
Well, we'd better hurry up
and book one.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.776
Sorry. They were
booked up hours ago.

14:05.777 --> 14:08.612
But I rent out
a lovely room
in my house.

14:08.613 --> 14:11.649
Ok, I'll bite. How much?

14:11.650 --> 14:15.319
It's going for
$45 a night.
Ok.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.655
Except in storm season.
Then it's 200.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.692
You know, pal,

14:21.693 --> 14:24.462
I'm gonna alert
the better business bureau
about you.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.029
Go ahead.

14:40.178 --> 14:42.179
Can I help you?

14:45.517 --> 14:48.084
This is the worst christmas
of my life!

14:48.085 --> 14:51.822
I'm stuck in this dinky airport!
My relationship is collapsing!

14:51.823 --> 14:55.726
And I've cleaned out
every cheese puff in this
stupid vending machine!

14:55.727 --> 14:58.095
And we have
noplace to sleep.

14:58.096 --> 15:01.365
Hey, ma'am. Ma'am,
you live around here.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.502
Could my friend and I
sleep at your house?
We'll pay you money.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.803
Perverts.

15:07.538 --> 15:09.506
See you at home, mom.

15:17.915 --> 15:19.951
Why are you putting that
up there?

15:19.952 --> 15:24.322
We had a little
wise man accident.

15:24.323 --> 15:28.693
Yeah. Now we have
two wise men and a clown.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.561
So now the three wise men

15:30.562 --> 15:32.997
Come bearing
gold, frankincense,
and a seltzer bottle.

15:34.632 --> 15:37.234
All right, he's all tied up.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.770
Bozo's on the roof.

15:39.771 --> 15:41.605
Guys, why don't you
take a break?

15:41.606 --> 15:43.808
Ilene's got cookies
for you.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.643
If they taste salty,
don't say anything.

15:45.644 --> 15:48.045
She's been crying
into the batter.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.887
I think I'll just
have some milk.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.922
Well, hidey-ho-ho-ho,
neighborette,

15:58.923 --> 16:00.791
And a merry christmas.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.526
Maybe on your side of the fence.

16:02.527 --> 16:05.262
I got boys crawling on the roof,
tim's stuck in alpena

16:05.263 --> 16:08.866
And a depressed orthodontist
crying into her pfeffernusse.

16:13.071 --> 16:16.974
Tim is stuck in alpena, huh?
That is such a lovely town.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.910
I have a good friend
who works there.
He's a clerk at the airport.

16:26.351 --> 16:28.452
I'm so disappointed.

16:28.453 --> 16:30.521
I was hoping to give tim
his present tonight.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.423
I got him something special.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.359
Well, I assume
it has something to do
with a car or a tool.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.095
Oh, yeah, both. I got him
a set of tools for the car

16:38.096 --> 16:40.430
And this thing called
a power inverter.

16:40.431 --> 16:43.767
It allows you to plug your tools
right into a car lighter.

16:43.768 --> 16:47.470
If he gets stuck in traffic,
instead of swearing,
he can build something.

16:47.471 --> 16:49.540
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:49.541 --> 16:51.575
That sounds like
the perfect gift for tim.

16:51.576 --> 16:54.511
Are you and judith spending
the holidays together?
Yes, indeedy.

16:54.512 --> 16:57.013
This is the first christmas
we've spent together,

16:57.014 --> 17:01.985
And I am so looking forward
to giving her the sweater
that I knitted for her.

17:01.986 --> 17:04.054
You knitted her a sweater?

17:04.055 --> 17:08.291
Mm-hmm. Right after
I sheared the sheep
and spun the wool.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.726
Wow!

17:09.727 --> 17:11.895
Then, later on,
I'm gonna fix her dinner.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.897
What are you making?
Lamb chops.

17:19.871 --> 17:24.208
Ok. Thanks. I've got some
good news for you.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.143
In the spirit
of christmas eve,

17:26.144 --> 17:30.581
I'm slashing
the price of my room
back to $45.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.217
In other words,
the storm is letting up.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.222
Yes. Yes, it is.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.991
You should be able
to get a flight
in about 15 minutes.

17:40.992 --> 17:42.860
Finally.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.297
Would you gentlemen care for
some flight insurance?

17:46.298 --> 17:47.497
<i>(both)</i> no!

17:49.935 --> 17:52.469
It looks like
we'll make it home
in time for christmas.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.271
The only problem is,

17:54.272 --> 17:56.740
I still don't know what to do
about ilene and my mother.

17:56.741 --> 18:00.444
How can I choose between
the woman who means more
to me than anything

18:00.445 --> 18:01.912
Or my girlfriend?

18:07.685 --> 18:10.654
On the other hand,
she is my mother.

18:10.655 --> 18:14.258
But on the other hand,
ilene could be the mother
of my children.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.459
On the other hand...

18:15.460 --> 18:18.395
Al, that's eight hands.

18:18.396 --> 18:22.433
Why don't you take one of them
and slap yourself?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.868
<i>(beeping)</i>

18:23.869 --> 18:27.204
Excuse me.
Are you by any chance
a doctor?

18:27.205 --> 18:29.873
No. He's a mama's boy.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.480
Ok, let me ask you
a question.

18:36.481 --> 18:38.616
Have you ever
thought about having kids?

18:38.617 --> 18:40.317
Of course.

18:40.318 --> 18:43.820
That's not gonna happen
with your mother.

18:43.821 --> 18:45.889
Tim, you don't understand.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.825
Just try me, will ya?

18:48.826 --> 18:51.094
I made a promise
before my dad died

18:51.095 --> 18:54.698
That I would
take care of my mother.

18:54.699 --> 18:57.534
And I just... I can't
turn my back on her.

18:57.535 --> 19:00.470
No one's asking you
to do that.

19:00.471 --> 19:03.373
I think ilene
just wants to feel

19:03.374 --> 19:06.043
That she won't take
a backseat to your mother.

19:06.044 --> 19:09.512
I mean, is she, or is she not,
the most important woman
in your life?

19:09.513 --> 19:13.417
She's the most important
woman under 50.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.586
You gotta do better
than that, al.
I don't know if I can!

19:16.587 --> 19:19.423
When you made that promise
to your dad,

19:19.424 --> 19:22.158
Don't you think
he would've wanted you

19:22.159 --> 19:26.896
To fall in love with a woman
and have a family?

19:26.897 --> 19:28.965
You're right.
I know I'm right.

19:28.966 --> 19:31.635
If your dad were here now,
what would he say to you?

19:31.636 --> 19:35.171
"al, stay with mother.
I'm going to the track."

19:41.479 --> 19:44.348
I see your point.
I think I have to set
some limits with my mother.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.015
Yes.

19:46.016 --> 19:48.518
And I'm gonna start
by getting rid of
this stupid beeper.

19:48.519 --> 19:49.653
All right.

19:49.654 --> 19:51.120
<i>(pilot)</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:51.121 --> 19:53.691
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the detroit metropolitan area.</i>

19:53.692 --> 19:55.025
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

19:55.026 --> 19:57.694
<i>Visibility is so low</i>
<i>that we are unable to land.</i>

19:57.695 --> 19:59.296
<i>(groans)</i>

19:59.297 --> 20:02.466
<i>It looks like we may</i>
<i>be diverted to toledo.</i>

20:02.467 --> 20:06.637
This is unbelievable! I won't
be home for the first time
at christmas.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.806
I have no gift for jill.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.941
I won't see the boys'
christmas lights.

20:10.942 --> 20:12.943
Have some faith.
There's still time.

20:12.944 --> 20:16.346
It's hopeless.
The kids'll be lighting it up
now anyway.

20:33.898 --> 20:35.633
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

20:35.634 --> 20:39.136
<i>A tremendous beam of light</i>
<i>has just broken through</i>
<i>the fog.</i>

20:39.137 --> 20:43.340
That's my house!
Those are our lights!

20:43.341 --> 20:45.909
<i>I've heard from the tower</i>
<i>that we now have visibility</i>

20:45.910 --> 20:48.545
<i>And will be able</i>
<i>to land after all.</i>

20:48.546 --> 20:51.015
All right!
Hey!

20:51.016 --> 20:54.685
If he lands there,
he's gonna land
right on the manger.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.086
Wait a minute.

20:58.556 --> 21:01.091
What's that clown
doing next to baby jesus?

21:07.699 --> 21:12.670
I can't believe we won
the lighting contest.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.705
And helped
land a plane.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.209
Well, this just proves
one thing, guys.

21:19.210 --> 21:22.279
Dad's been holding us back
all these years.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.651
Oh, al. I'm so glad
we're back together again.

21:27.652 --> 21:30.220
Me, too. And, you know,

21:30.221 --> 21:33.057
It was the easiest
decision of my life.

21:41.132 --> 21:42.800
It's a power inverter.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.235
All these tools for the car.
I love this. Thanks.

21:45.236 --> 21:47.604
Ok, my turn.
All right.
You're gonna love it.

21:47.605 --> 21:50.674
Undo this... All right.

21:50.675 --> 21:52.076
It's a beeper!

21:58.883 --> 22:01.085
Well, I figured,
you know,

22:01.086 --> 22:03.120
If anytime I wanted
to tell you I love you,

22:03.121 --> 22:05.255
I can just do it
24 hours a day now.

22:05.256 --> 22:06.656
<i>(beeping)</i>

22:09.928 --> 22:12.896
Gee, tim! I'd love to tell you
how touched I am,

22:12.897 --> 22:15.099
But I have to call
al's mother.

22:19.403 --> 22:21.672
We'll have to sleep here
in the airport?

22:21.673 --> 22:22.739
Afraid not.

22:27.545 --> 22:30.981
It's, like,
we can't have people walking
around outside the aircraft.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.851
What are you gonna do,
drive to detroit?

22:33.852 --> 22:37.254
Pilot, there's people
outside of the airplane.
You're way too low.

22:37.255 --> 22:40.324
You should be able
to get a flight
in about 15 minutes.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.726
Finally.

22:42.727 --> 22:45.596
Would you gentlemen care for
some flight insurance?

22:45.597 --> 22:47.264
<i>(both)</i> no!

22:47.265 --> 22:51.268
Ok, but if your plane crashes,
you'll be sorry.
