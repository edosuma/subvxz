00:30.312 --> 00:34.812
A plague has descended upon Earth.

00:36.396 --> 00:41.312
In only two cities have people survived.

00:42.479 --> 00:46.896
In Weimar,
they kill the infected immediately.

00:48.521 --> 00:53.146
In Jena, they are looking for a cure.

00:54.687 --> 00:58.854
Nobody is allowed to leave the cities.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.600
PLEASE DO NOT HOARD
WE HAVE ENOUGH WATER AGAIN

02:49.229 --> 02:52.437
REGISTER FOR WORK
AT THE PROTECTIVE FENCE

02:54.771 --> 02:57.271
<i>A brook a-burbling in my ears.
There is no room for you.</i>

02:57.437 --> 03:00.771
<i>The grass a-growing in my eyes.
There is no room for you.</i>

03:00.937 --> 03:04.396
<i>A woodpecker's nest within my heart.
There is no room for you.</i>

03:05.312 --> 03:08.854
<i>I am a rock. I have seen life and death.</i>

03:09.021 --> 03:12.354
<i>Know, you evil spirits, I don't sleep.</i>

03:22.021 --> 03:25.646
<i>I am a rock, a rock.</i>

03:25.812 --> 03:28.979
<i>Know, you evil spirits, I don't sleep.</i>

03:29.812 --> 03:31.937
<i>No, I don't sleep.</i>

03:33.979 --> 03:37.396
Aren't they thriving inside
just as beautifully as outside?

04:06.104 --> 04:09.146
They keep asking for people
to help at the fence.

04:17.521 --> 04:34.206
EVER AFTER

04:52.479 --> 04:54.729
Look what I found.

04:58.563 --> 05:01.563
Try it.
It might take your mind off things.

05:03.229 --> 05:04.313
I'm not sure.

05:05.021 --> 05:07.771
We could use a little colour in here.

05:56.229 --> 05:57.813
Renata!

05:58.063 --> 06:00.646
Renata! Get out! Come here now!

06:27.438 --> 06:28.938
<i>Renata.</i>

06:29.104 --> 06:30.938
<i>Renata, where are you?</i>

06:31.979 --> 06:33.313
<i>Are you here?</i>

06:39.396 --> 06:41.188
You are an angel.

06:42.021 --> 06:44.021
Why are you still here?

06:56.146 --> 06:57.604
You must leave!

06:58.688 --> 07:00.813
SECURE WARD

07:08.104 --> 07:10.313
<i>I'm not crazy. I heard you.</i>

07:49.313 --> 07:50.729
Let's go, everyone!

07:57.930 --> 07:59.520
Isabelle. Hi.

08:01.354 --> 08:02.729
And you are?

08:04.854 --> 08:06.188
Vivi.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.896
Cute!

08:11.479 --> 08:15.229
- I like your hair colour, by the way.
- Do your eyes hurt, too?

08:15.396 --> 08:17.896
How long haven't you been out?

08:18.063 --> 08:20.146
Two years. From since it began.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.229
Has it really only been two years?

08:23.563 --> 08:25.188
Seems like half my life.

08:52.104 --> 08:54.438
You wanted to see the thing
with the shovel?

08:54.604 --> 08:56.021
Yes.

09:00.063 --> 09:02.396
First, cover the body with a cloth.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.810
You'll manage when the time comes.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.563
The new ones.

09:46.771 --> 09:48.063
Wow.

09:48.313 --> 09:50.563
We're down to the weaklings now.

09:51.438 --> 09:53.313
Any news on my transfer application?

09:53.479 --> 09:56.729
You've got three more hours
of your shift. Or can't you cope?

09:59.104 --> 10:00.729
I always cope.

10:31.521 --> 10:32.771
Here.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.771
The train to Jena.

10:41.604 --> 10:43.563
I wonder that it's like there now.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.188
You won't ever take that train.

10:48.146 --> 10:50.521
Supplies only.
Any other transport is forbidden.

10:50.688 --> 10:55.521
It would be too creepy anyway.
No driver. All automatic.

11:59.354 --> 12:00.854
Who was responsible?

12:01.563 --> 12:05.313
Who let this novice work on the fence?

12:09.104 --> 12:12.354
The arm is off.
The infection can't reach her brain.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.021
No exceptions!

12:23.396 --> 12:26.563
Why do you think only two cities survived?

12:33.729 --> 12:35.271
Those are the rules.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.604
Anyone else get hurt?

13:56.646 --> 13:58.438
Renata, come out!

14:00.438 --> 14:02.604
Come here now!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You'll be needed tomorrow.

15:10.063 --> 15:11.854
<i>No exceptions!</i>

15:16.813 --> 15:18.396
<i>Those are the rules.</i>

15:33.938 --> 15:35.688
We don't have any time.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.521
Soon the weeds will grow in our veins.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.896
Go out and bury what haunts you.

16:25.313 --> 16:27.646
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

16:28.771 --> 16:30.604
<i>I'll find you.</i>

18:36.729 --> 18:38.313
I want to leave.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.729
Shut up.

18:54.021 --> 18:55.646
What's going on?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.854
Shit.

19:33.104 --> 19:35.021
Don't you have a weapon?

19:47.188 --> 19:48.563
Very funny.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.563
- I'll take a look outside.
- What?

20:42.229 --> 20:43.813
And?

20:44.938 --> 20:46.896
We're really up shit creek.

20:48.229 --> 20:52.563
A broken-down train in the middle
of nowhere. And no one knows we're here.

20:56.104 --> 20:58.729
They'll send people.
The train is valuable.

21:29.063 --> 21:32.729
It's broken. Has been for a few months.

21:51.521 --> 21:54.938
There were always
water tanks in the bathrooms.

21:57.146 --> 22:00.104
You do know the story
about the toilet zombie, right?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.271
It's not locked.

22:14.354 --> 22:16.021
Those creatures seldom lock the door,
anyway.

24:03.771 --> 24:05.146
Shit.

24:34.438 --> 24:36.313
I couldn't find the keys.

25:04.479 --> 25:06.313
Would you have left without me?

25:08.813 --> 25:11.563
Without you
I wouldn't stand a chance out there.

25:30.146 --> 25:32.104
To calm me down.

25:46.563 --> 25:48.979
Why did you want to leave Weimar?

26:05.680 --> 26:08.688
You didn't like it in
the loony bin either, did you?

27:16.146 --> 27:19.271
A brook a-burbling in my ears.
There is no room for you.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.854
The grass a-growing in my eyes.
There is no room for you.

27:23.021 --> 27:26.604
A woodpecker's nest within my heart.
There is no room for you.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.146
Know, you evil spirits...

27:31.271 --> 27:33.063
Go away!

27:46.063 --> 27:47.854
What do you see?

27:48.104 --> 27:49.521
I don't know.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.771
You lured them here.

28:14.688 --> 28:17.688
- What will we do now?
- That's your problem.

28:23.646 --> 28:24.938
Shit!

28:31.854 --> 28:33.104
It's over.

28:34.729 --> 28:36.438
It was meant to be.

28:52.729 --> 28:54.229
I want to go back.

28:54.396 --> 28:57.729
I never wanted out. There's nothing here.
I can't even run fast.

28:57.896 --> 28:59.938
Pull yourself together!

29:00.104 --> 29:01.771
I have to reach Jena.

30:53.813 --> 30:55.479
Take me with you!

30:56.229 --> 30:57.900
Why should I?

30:58.063 --> 30:59.300
For you.

31:01.354 --> 31:03.729
- Don't touch my stuff!
- I repaired it.

31:08.063 --> 31:10.813
The shutter wasn't releasing.
The contacts tend to get rusty.

31:10.979 --> 31:12.896
How do you know that stuff?

31:37.354 --> 31:39.354
Put some decent shoes on.

31:49.146 --> 31:50.479
No!

31:51.688 --> 31:53.063
You don't need those anymore.

32:49.021 --> 32:52.771
Aren't there tricks to finding water?
Like with a divining rod?

32:54.229 --> 32:56.771
What did you do before this whole mess?

32:57.521 --> 33:00.000
I fixed stolen cameras for eBay.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.979
Really?

33:04.104 --> 33:05.438
eBay.

33:06.354 --> 33:08.188
Haven't heard that for a while.

33:10.396 --> 33:12.021
Bad girl.

33:16.229 --> 33:20.104
- What did you do when it all started?
- What everyone did.

33:25.146 --> 33:26.563
I saved myself.

33:37.771 --> 33:38.896
Leave it open!

33:39.896 --> 33:41.188
Open up!

33:48.854 --> 33:50.021
And you?

33:52.104 --> 33:54.896
I spent three days on a roof
and couldn't move.

33:56.229 --> 33:57.896
I was basically dead.

34:01.813 --> 34:05.813
Then the warden rescued me
and lost her two friends in the process.

34:49.563 --> 34:51.396
That was our rescue team.

34:51.563 --> 34:54.978
- They'll get up again in a minute.
- They're not getting up.

34:55.146 --> 34:57.200
They shot themselves.

35:01.479 --> 35:03.354
We have to keep going.

35:13.188 --> 35:14.688
- Get up!
- Go!

35:32.021 --> 35:33.646
Where are we?

35:33.813 --> 35:37.188
No idea. But Jena can't be far.

35:38.688 --> 35:39.729
This way.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.646
Can't we just go back?

35:44.479 --> 35:46.563
And do you know where that is?

37:13.229 --> 37:16.000
They must have escaped from Erfurt zoo.

37:38.771 --> 37:40.271
Safe travels, my friends.

37:41.271 --> 37:43.396
I'll catch you again someday.

37:46.021 --> 37:48.229
Come on, let's do something cheesy.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.896
Here.

38:05.229 --> 38:07.604
I always wanted to become a photographer.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.104
Before the outbreak,
I'd just won a scholarship in the States.

38:22.146 --> 38:24.271
My flight never took off.

38:31.729 --> 38:33.771
My sister is still out there.

38:38.854 --> 38:40.521
Did you love her?

38:42.313 --> 38:44.146
Most of the time, I hated her.

38:48.563 --> 38:50.354
<i>Come on, swim with me.</i>

38:51.229 --> 38:54.688
Let's have a competition.
Who can hold their breath the longest.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.313
Okay, I lose.

39:05.396 --> 39:08.000
Renata was always our sunshine.

39:09.896 --> 39:13.063
She had everyone
wrapped around her finger.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.021
But at night, she was always scared.

39:22.479 --> 39:26.146
She invented her own gods,
gods of the sun, of the mountains

39:26.313 --> 39:28.563
so they would take her fear away.

39:35.771 --> 39:39.063
She would lie in the dark
and talk to herself.

39:39.896 --> 39:41.021
And pray.

39:43.521 --> 39:47.854
My family is still out there too.
Bashing each other's heads in.

39:50.313 --> 39:53.146
Pretty much what they used to do before.

39:57.563 --> 39:58.896
Screw that.

39:59.813 --> 40:01.271
We're here.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.438
It looks ancient.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.188
Still works though.

41:44.021 --> 41:46.063
Do you think we're being tested?

41:47.896 --> 41:49.400
I think...

41:51.021 --> 41:53.688
Earth is a wise old lady

41:54.396 --> 41:58.729
and humans haven't paid her
any rent for a long time.

41:59.396 --> 42:02.771
And out there, that's our eviction order.

42:16.104 --> 42:18.438
There are some good things
about this apocalypse.

42:22.938 --> 42:25.021
You don't get it, do you?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.979
Well, eventually.

42:32.146 --> 42:35.771
Smash your sister's head in
if you find her.

43:13.896 --> 43:15.521
What's wrong with her?

43:15.771 --> 43:18.000
I've never seen anything like that.

43:19.396 --> 43:21.646
Something's growing from her face.

43:21.813 --> 43:22.938
Weeds?

44:12.188 --> 44:13.688
Want to practise?

44:13.938 --> 44:17.104
- Leave her.
- What are you so afraid of?

44:17.896 --> 44:20.354
You think it'll make you a bad person?

44:22.313 --> 44:24.563
The people we once were are dead.

44:25.938 --> 44:27.729
We shouldn't mourn them.

45:00.063 --> 45:02.438
No, let's leave.
We don't know who's in there.

45:03.104 --> 45:04.771
We have to drink.

45:05.021 --> 45:07.604
They can't be more broken than you.

45:18.063 --> 45:20.313
Come on. I'll protect you.

46:41.479 --> 46:43.188
Is something there?

46:43.354 --> 46:44.354
No.

46:44.813 --> 46:45.813
Nothing.

47:13.729 --> 47:15.229
Where are they?

47:33.896 --> 47:35.896
They just left everything.

48:21.354 --> 48:22.563
Eva!

48:26.479 --> 48:28.000
There's someone in there.

48:29.813 --> 48:30.854
Hello?

48:33.313 --> 48:36.271
Vivi, you don't know who's in there.

48:37.313 --> 48:39.438
They might have killed all the others.

49:24.646 --> 49:26.479
Hey! Stop it!

50:47.313 --> 50:48.313
Vivi!

50:56.563 --> 50:57.771
Hit it!

51:14.354 --> 51:18.063
Do you know why you didn't strike?
Because you pity them.

51:18.313 --> 51:20.104
And I know why.

51:20.271 --> 51:21.396
Why?

51:22.896 --> 51:24.771
Because you're like them.

51:27.188 --> 51:30.604
- You have no goal. You're nothing.
- That's not true.

51:30.771 --> 51:32.271
I know what I want.

51:35.021 --> 51:36.521
I want us to be friends.

51:38.063 --> 51:39.771
I know exactly what you want.

51:40.563 --> 51:43.313
To save your poor sister
from rotting out there.

51:44.063 --> 51:46.229
- But you can't.
- Yes, I can.

51:46.396 --> 51:50.229
What you can do is die.
You don't want to live anyway.

51:56.729 --> 51:58.500
Do you get it now?

52:02.896 --> 52:04.521
Best we split up.

53:41.521 --> 53:43.938
It didn't go the way you expected.

53:46.854 --> 53:48.146
No, it didn't.

53:48.313 --> 53:50.500
Where did you want to go now?

53:54.729 --> 53:56.438
I don't know anymore.

53:57.104 --> 53:59.104
You won't get far on your own.

54:14.146 --> 54:15.438
Help me.

54:16.396 --> 54:19.000
I don't need humans around me anymore.

54:23.938 --> 54:26.271
Maybe I'll make an exception.

54:37.063 --> 54:39.146
What is your favourite colour?

54:39.813 --> 54:40.854
What?

54:41.646 --> 54:44.021
Do you prefer sweet or savoury foods?

54:44.896 --> 54:46.854
Who are you?

54:49.896 --> 54:51.271
I'm the gardener.

54:59.479 --> 55:03.396
What's happening is necessary.
It should have happened a long time ago.

55:06.521 --> 55:09.021
The unwelcome guests must leave.

55:11.563 --> 55:14.229
But our cities have fences.
We can live on.

55:15.063 --> 55:16.813
You refuse to understand.

55:17.771 --> 55:19.771
We're still here. People help each other.

55:19.938 --> 55:21.438
Is that so?

55:23.396 --> 55:27.021
Where do you think
your place is in this world?

55:31.188 --> 55:33.021
There is no place for me.

55:38.313 --> 55:40.229
Rest now.

56:05.979 --> 56:07.000
Yah?

56:07.146 --> 56:10.021
<i>Run for cover!
The basement or the roof. Quick!</i>

56:29.396 --> 56:30.646
Renata, please get out.

56:31.604 --> 56:32.729
- Hey!
- No!

58:05.688 --> 58:10.646
If you have enough courage for that,
you might as well try living.

58:20.604 --> 58:22.021
When will it end?

58:22.604 --> 58:24.104
When will it end?

58:25.438 --> 58:30.229
The day an angel appears
in the company of a beast.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.521
You want to bury your sister,
but don't know where she is.

58:38.354 --> 58:39.979
I'll protect you.

58:40.854 --> 58:44.521
You'll never have
to set foot out there again.

59:10.729 --> 59:12.146
Go ahead, eat.

59:52.271 --> 59:55.188
- Are you human?
- I am what you see.

59:59.604 --> 01:00:02.854
Humankind is disappearing from Earth.

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:05.563
Only just arrived and already finished.

01:00:06.938 --> 01:00:10.000
The blink of an eye in nature's history.

01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:18.563
What destroyed humankind...

01:00:19.688 --> 01:00:23.188
we have been carrying with us
for millions of years.

01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:27.313
The virus was lying in wait.

01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:33.729
Now it is time to take the chance
this downfall is giving us.

01:00:37.271 --> 01:00:39.313
But what are you doing here?

01:00:39.479 --> 01:00:41.604
I'm opening unexpected doors.

01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.729
Everything is changing.
There is peace in chaos.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:54.854
Neither destruction
nor pills will save people.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:59.688
Something new will arise.

01:01:03.313 --> 01:01:04.896
They seemed perfect.

01:01:05.813 --> 01:01:07.229
And yet...

01:01:08.688 --> 01:01:11.104
their greed was never under control.

01:01:12.313 --> 01:01:14.146
And that was their downfall?

01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:17.063
Yes.

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:22.604
Humankind could have lived in paradise.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.396
They missed their chance.

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:30.938
Now they might become paradise themselves.

01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:34.188
Creatures without rage or hate.

01:01:34.896 --> 01:01:36.313
Or fear.

01:01:39.604 --> 01:01:41.396
I don't want to feel afraid anymore.

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:24.729
Eva!

01:02:35.771 --> 01:02:36.979
Just stop.

01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:40.021
It's too late for her.

01:02:46.646 --> 01:02:48.771
I'll give her an extension.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.771
If you stay with me.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.354
I cannot save her.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.729
She just has to reach Jena.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.563
I'll stay.

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.060
Thanks.

01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:27.396
We are leaving.

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:18.813
In the city...

01:05:23.438 --> 01:05:25.521
everyone always wanted me around.

01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:28.729
Eva can do it.

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:32.313
Eva can do anything.

01:05:33.188 --> 01:05:34.938
She's the best.

01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:40.271
But in reality, they all despised me.

01:05:44.271 --> 01:05:46.000
I can't get rid of them.

01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:48.854
Who?

01:05:50.896 --> 01:05:53.229
All those whose lives I ended.

01:05:55.063 --> 01:05:56.521
They follow me around.

01:05:59.563 --> 01:06:01.188
They eat with me...

01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:04.188
and they never sleep.

01:06:18.854 --> 01:06:20.521
Do you see them?

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.563
It's my fault my sister's dead.

01:06:27.938 --> 01:06:29.354
It's my fault.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:33.354
No one is to blame for what happened.

01:06:34.021 --> 01:06:36.271
What's important is we're still here.

01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:38.688
Right, only the arseholes survived.

01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:40.771
You saved my life.

01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:43.729
You're the best person I ever met.

01:06:43.979 --> 01:06:45.188
Shut up.

01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:47.604
Arseholes have to stick together.

01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:09.229
Okay, we have to go back down. Come on.

01:07:34.313 --> 01:07:35.563
Are you alright?

01:07:42.354 --> 01:07:43.479
Eva.

01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:46.479
Come on.

01:07:48.896 --> 01:07:50.688
Come on. Careful.

01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:08.771
There are lots.

01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:12.813
Run!

01:08:41.854 --> 01:08:44.479
Run!
Make something out of your shitty life!

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:47.145
Eva!

01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:03.896
Do you want to come with me?

01:17:07.563 --> 01:17:08.896
Okay.

01:18:36.938 --> 01:18:39.646
You came this far all by yourself.

01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:55.146
You called me, but I didn't want to hear.

01:19:04.396 --> 01:19:08.271
Were you teasing me or did you want
to see me one more time?

01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:19.938
I always laughed at you,
but I still know your prayer.

01:19:27.271 --> 01:19:31.479
Believing in your gods
was the only thing that kept me alive.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.896
You know the good thing
about our apocalypse?

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:02.396
You can see all the stars again.

01:21:26.396 --> 01:21:28.146
I can't stay with you.

01:23:19.438 --> 01:23:22.021
I don't think they'd
particularly like you there.

01:23:27.104 --> 01:23:28.438
Are you coming?

01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:53.104
I am a rock. I have seen life and death.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.271
Know, you evil spirits, I do not sleep.

01:24:15.896 --> 01:24:17.938
<i>We will not disappear from Earth.</i>

01:24:18.938 --> 01:24:20.438
<i>We will live.</i>

01:24:21.313 --> 01:24:23.146
<i>Without rage.</i>

01:24:23.313 --> 01:24:25.146
<i>Without greed.</i>

01:24:25.313 --> 01:24:26.604
<i>Without fear.</i>

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.104
<i>With nature.</i>

01:24:29.688 --> 01:24:32.521
<i>With what is growing in our veins.</i>

01:24:36.313 --> 01:24:37.854
<i>This is not the end.</i>

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.646
<i>This is the beginning.</i>
