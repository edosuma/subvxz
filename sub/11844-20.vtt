15:20.886 --> 15:23.514
Demands?

15:23.588 --> 15:26.683
He wants a list of demands.

15:26.758 --> 15:29.989
- I could use a burger.
- Sean.

15:30.062 --> 15:33.088
Yeah. Yeah, right. We got
a bunch of hungry people down here...

15:33.165 --> 15:35.657
and we want burgers
all around.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.668
- And fries.
- And fries.

15:37.736 --> 15:41.604
Right. Listen, um,
couldn't we at least talk about-

15:41.673 --> 15:44.199
No, no talking
until we get our food!

15:44.276 --> 15:47.041
And when it's delivered,
I don't wanna see any cops.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.877
And no aliens either.
I can tell.

15:54.386 --> 15:58.323
Nobody comes in
and nobody goes out.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.883
We'll all just
stay here together...

16:01.960 --> 16:05.555
like one big happy family.

16:12.804 --> 16:15.296
Excuse me, love.

16:15.373 --> 16:18.172
I just need to borrow
your cousin for a while.

16:27.252 --> 16:30.813
- That's it!
- What?

16:30.889 --> 16:34.018
Dimaras rock.

16:34.092 --> 16:36.925
I couldn't remember before,
but the namejust came to me.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.896
Dimaras,
after the third moon.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.195
[Chuckles]
It's where you two first met.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.633
You must remember.

16:45.704 --> 16:49.299
Dimaras rock.
ltjuts out over the water.

16:49.374 --> 16:52.036
Ah, I can see it
so clearly.

16:52.110 --> 16:55.011
<i>The moon hanging
over the horizon...</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:59.278
<i>and the color of the water--
crimson red.</i>

16:59.351 --> 17:02.446
I was there with you before you
were king. We were swimming.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.458
And you looked up
and saw her on a rock.

17:06.525 --> 17:10.894
<i>You said she was the most
beautiful girl you'd ever seen.</i>

17:10.962 --> 17:14.990
<i>But, of course, you were too afraid
to go and talk to her.</i>

17:15.066 --> 17:19.263
<i>I offered to make the approach on
your behalf, but you told me not to.</i>

17:19.337 --> 17:24.241
Back then, you were always
so nervous and quiet.

17:24.309 --> 17:27.369
But lucky for you,
I was neither shy nor obedient.

17:27.444 --> 17:30.506
<i>So I went and met her...</i>

17:30.582 --> 17:34.143
<i>and introduced you two
the same night.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:36.278
At a party.

17:43.461 --> 17:45.395
That's a nice story.

17:45.463 --> 17:48.398
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

17:49.668 --> 17:53.764
<i>Don't you remember?
Please, Zan.</i>

17:53.838 --> 17:56.933
I have to know that
what's in my head is real.

17:57.008 --> 18:02.174
I'm sorry, Brody,
but none of that is real.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.114
<i>None of that ever happened.</i>

18:05.183 --> 18:08.813
But you do love her. I know you do.
I was there when you met.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.686
You're wrong.
We're not in love.

18:11.756 --> 18:15.283
<i>We never have been.</i>

18:36.848 --> 18:40.148
Damn it.
It's Hanson.

18:43.588 --> 18:45.647
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>

18:48.927 --> 18:52.056
<i>[ Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

18:52.130 --> 18:56.431
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>[ Valenti] Step away 290m the door.</i>

18:56.501 --> 18:58.833
Sheriff?
Where are you?

19:03.008 --> 19:05.477
There you are.

19:05.543 --> 19:07.671
I had Ralph look into
the power outage.

19:07.746 --> 19:11.239
Turns out the surge that caused all this
emanated from the U.F.O. Center here.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.480
- Figured I check it out.
- Turn your flashlight off and get up here.

19:15.553 --> 19:18.523
<i>This could be alien related.
You shouldni invite him into this.</i>

19:18.590 --> 19:23.551
It's safer having him up here than going in there
with his gun and stirring things up.

19:27.098 --> 19:30.363
<i>[ Valenti]
The U.F.O. Centefs an old fallout shelter...</i>

19:30.435 --> 19:32.494
so it only has
one set of doors.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.699
And they automatically lock
whenever the power goes out.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.175
Now, I think there might be
some people trapped in there.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.338
- Need any help?
- Sure. Sure.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.745
But with traffic lights out
all over town...

19:43.815 --> 19:47.615
- I thinkyou're gonna have your hands full.
- Right. Traffic control.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.519
Should probably take care
of that one first.

19:50.588 --> 19:53.853
Good. Good.
Yeah, I got this one covered, I think.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.917
Thank you, Sheriff.
Uh,jim.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.089
Watch yourself, now.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.603
You know, it'd be faster
if I just did it.

20:06.671 --> 20:09.106
<i>[ Michael]
Then they won't taste as good.</i>

20:09.174 --> 20:12.075
What about the fries?

20:15.814 --> 20:19.148
I'll be able to see whatever you see,
and I'll be-

20:19.217 --> 20:21.982
Watching the whole time.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.613
All I want you to do
is deliver the food.

20:24.689 --> 20:27.818
Let me get a good look
at the layout of the room...

20:27.892 --> 20:31.157
what's going on down there,
who's positioned where, that kind of thing.

20:31.229 --> 20:33.197
- Then I want you-
- “Then I want you to get right out.“

20:33.264 --> 20:35.926
- You told me.
- Right.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.934
Sheriff.
Sheriff, I'm okay.

20:38.002 --> 20:42.269
I can do this.
I wanna do this.

20:44.809 --> 20:47.005
Hey, how's the food coming?

20:47.078 --> 20:49.103
- It's done.
-[Bell Dings]

20:52.150 --> 20:54.084
Here you are.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.211
- [Knocking]
- Suppefs here.

20:56.287 --> 20:58.255
- I'll <i>buzz her in.</i>
- <i>[ Buzzer Buzzes ]</i>

21:00.024 --> 21:03.983
<i>Yeah, yeah, come down. I'll, uh-
I'!! move some of this stuff</i>

21:04.062 --> 21:06.690
Watch your head there.
Here, let me give you a hand.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.756
Okay.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.169
- So, what have we got here?
- Oh.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.468
We have got six burgers
and six fries.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.441
Great. Lovely.
Uh, now- Right.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.777
Oh. Oh, no.
It's on the house.

21:23.848 --> 21:26.374
Oh, no.
No, I insist. Please.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.385
And, uh,
keep the change.

21:28.453 --> 21:32.356
- I think I'm rich.
- So, urn, is that it?

21:32.424 --> 21:36.122
<i>- Can- Can I get you something else?
- No, no, that's fine,.</i>

21:36.194 --> 21:40.153
You can go.
And thanks for the food.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.838
Is there a new cook
at the Crashdown?

21:47.906 --> 21:51.399
- Excuse me?
- These burgers, they taste different.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.468
<i>Oh. Oh. Oh, well, see,
there's no power over there either.</i>

21:54.546 --> 21:57.413
So we had to use
this little butane grill.

21:58.583 --> 22:01.211
So how did you cook the fries?

22:01.286 --> 22:03.380
The same way.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.254
No. No, you didn't.

22:06.357 --> 22:11.090
<i>You used alien power to cook this food.
You're one of them!</i>

22:11.162 --> 22:14.325
<i>- [Liz] I- But--
- [ Max] Brody, let her go!</i>

22:14.399 --> 22:16.333
- Larek!
- Get down!

22:24.676 --> 22:28.374
That was a stupid thing
to do.

22:29.914 --> 22:33.111
She's not an alien.
She's just an innocent girl.

22:33.184 --> 22:35.915
- Leave her alone.

the food and that everything was okay.</i>

22:43.328 --> 22:48.630

<i>This doesn't help me to be
in a very reasonable state of mind.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

- Why? It's your fault he got stabbed. Heal him.

<i>Brody's a good man. This isn't his fault.

- I told you. People are-
- I/mow.

People are down there.
But there's gotta be more to it.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.127

We use that for surveillance.

- I'm not the deputy anymore, remember?

It's what you and I

Way to change the subject.

26:38.796 --> 26:42.528

26:51.008 --> 26:52.942
<i>Kyle, what are you doing here?</i>

26:53.010 --> 26:55.604
I heard over the scanner that the cops were
getting ready to storm the U.F.O. Center.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.978
- They called sharpshooters in from
the state police. - Oh, damn it.

26:58.049 --> 27:01.815
- Those guys'll shoot anything that moves.
- What's going on down there?

got rid of that thing.</i>

That controls the fallout shelter's
lock-down mechanism.

- You think it still works?
- I don't know.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.932
<i>If it does, it might be a way
to keep the cavalry out long enough...</i>

27:20.004 --> 27:22.439
to end this thing
without anybody getting killed.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.601
Well, great.
How do we get to it?

27:24.675 --> 27:27.474
It's too risky to try
to get inside.

27:27.545 --> 27:29.479
There might be a way
to activate it from the outside.

27:29.547 --> 27:32.073
Kyle, you think you can get me
the blueprints to that place?

27:32.150 --> 27:34.084
Where am I supposed
to get those?

27:34.152 --> 27:36.416
Library, third floor,
in the back.

27:36.487 --> 27:39.252
- The library's closed.
- Kick the window in! Go!

28:21.265 --> 28:24.792
<i>Yes, all of them.</i>

28:24.869 --> 28:28.897
But if I'm Larek,

and you're Zan,
also an alien...

28:34.612 --> 28:36.774
what- what are we doing here?

28:38.282 --> 28:41.047
Surviving.

28:41.118 --> 28:43.052
Biding our time until we return.

28:47.124 --> 28:51.527

Yes.</i>

28:53.598 --> 28:57.398

- All <i>of us.</i>

29:06.911 --> 29:08.936
That's incredible.

29:11.582 --> 29:15.712
Now, I think it's time
you put down the gun.

29:15.786 --> 29:18.812
Yeah.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.881
Yeah.
