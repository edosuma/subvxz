01:56.200 --> 02:00.538
<i>Oh, should Auld acquaintance</i>

02:00.579 --> 02:02.248
<i>Be forgot--</i>

02:02.331 --> 02:05.084
No, no. I would
never forget you.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.710
I will never forget you.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.966
- After you, my dear old friend.
- Thank you.

02:26.689 --> 02:29.233
Oh, dear.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.401
Call me if you get blue.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.944
I am blue.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.195
Call me.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.030
The phone will be ringing
by the time you get home.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.991
OK.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.367
Here I go.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.589
Wait till she gets in, please.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.800
- Allison.
- What?

02:55.467 --> 02:56.969
Happy new year.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.430
Happy new year, honey.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.099
Bye.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.235
Gracie Mansion, please.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.723
Fish.
They've multiplied.

03:42.806 --> 03:47.436
<i>Lord Jeffrey Emmers</i>

03:47.478 --> 03:52.524
<i>Was a soldier, royal and true</i>

03:52.608 --> 03:57.446
<i>And he set upon the Indians</i>
<i>who didn't do his sight</i>

03:57.488 --> 03:59.490
<i>Oh, Hammersteer--</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:01.158
Oh, hello.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.493
Ten-hut!

04:02.701 --> 04:03.702
Line up.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.788
Hello, Pepino.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.082
Hello, little Lord Byron.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.376
Come here.
Come here, lay one on me.

04:35.859 --> 04:40.531
Four, three, two, one.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.411
- Frank--
- Please.

05:27.453 --> 05:28.912
Just wait a minute!
Forget it.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.582
- Just forget it.
- That's easy to say.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.958
You don't understand.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.085
See, I don't care anymore.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.963
I don't care what
makes sense anymore.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.466
I don't give a rusty fuck.

05:40.549 --> 05:43.761
If they boot me
down the city hall steps

05:43.802 --> 05:45.471
and send me back
to the Bronx.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.847
We got to get this guy.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.350
Everything that can be done
is being done.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.435
My daughter was with her
last night.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.853
It was my daughter, my child.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.021
It could have been her.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.522
This is not politics anymore.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.274
Everything's politics!

05:57.316 --> 05:58.984
The hell it is!

05:59.068 --> 06:01.403
- I can't even sleep.
- Bullshit!

06:01.445 --> 06:03.405
When you point your finger
at some guy, and you say,

06:03.447 --> 06:05.699
this is the guy
that can do the job,

06:05.783 --> 06:07.368
ain't the flashbulbs going?

06:08.285 --> 06:10.621
Don't you read it
in the papers the next day?

06:10.704 --> 06:11.830
Get me your brother.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.292
And get him now.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.128
And get him before
you go to the ballet, Frank.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.568
Get those hoses up here.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.487
Come on, move.

06:44.822 --> 06:45.989
Move it!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.616
Get it on, Charlie.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.743
OK, Charlie, pull it up.

06:51.829 --> 06:55.124
In the windows.
Put it in the windows.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.501
Come on, aim for the windows.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.637
Turn it up...

07:08.679 --> 07:10.973
Keep that pressure up.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.435
Turn it up!

07:17.521 --> 07:19.356
- Chief?
- Yeah?

07:19.398 --> 07:21.233
I'm looking for
one of your men.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.444
Who are you?

07:23.861 --> 07:25.320
Franklin Starkey.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.322
I'm Chief Sunday.
Who you want?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.699
Nick Starkey.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.618
He's in there.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.372
Well, get him out here.
I have to talk to him.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.960
It remains to be seen
whether or not he is coming out.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.214
What is that doing
in the other way?

07:44.256 --> 07:46.049
Tell them to get the hoses up.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.223
That window.
Over there! Get chopping.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.600
Get chopping now!

07:55.476 --> 07:57.019
Come on. Move it.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.896
Move it. Start axing.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.218
Stay with him.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.595
Hey, unfetter that line.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.946
Hi there.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.117
I'll take it from here, Nick.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.044
I wonder if I can get a cup
of coffee?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.129
Preferably espresso.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.691
I'm not happy
to see you, Frank.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.109
You should be.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.443
I've come to take you
away from all this

09:28.485 --> 09:30.195
and make you a big shot.

09:30.696 --> 09:31.989
I never wanted to be
a big shot, Frank.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.156
That's your thing.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.367
You must be up the creek
to be here talking to me.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.538
The mayor knows you're good
at this kind of thing.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.248
You must be out of your mind
with amnesia

09:41.331 --> 09:42.416
to be here talking to me.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.543
Now calm down, Nick.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.336
I'm a fireman.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.754
We're going to reinstate you.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.967
I'm a fireman now!

09:52.342 --> 09:55.345
We're gonna take all the heat
we have to from the press.

09:55.387 --> 09:59.141
I run into these fucking buildings
when they're on fire!

09:59.766 --> 10:02.519
You're gonna get a commendation
for what you did tonight.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.396
Please, don't bother
on my account.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.939
That was very heroic.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.361
Go, Frank.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.697
Go.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.367
There's a lot between us.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.786
None of it is good.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.622
Please.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.958
It's my career.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.764
All right.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.767
I'll come back.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.813
Frank.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.067
On one condition.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.194
What do you think of Maria?

11:34.277 --> 11:36.279
- Who's Maria?
- The ballerina.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.407
She doesn't trust
her partner enough.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.533
Should she?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.535
I don't think she
has any other choice.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.914
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know. He's late.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.667
In that case, let me see you
through intermission.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.297
I did too. It's delicious.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.425
- Yummy.
- Mrs. Starkey,

11:56.466 --> 11:58.969
where is the commissioner
tonight?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.263
Here he is. Excuse me.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.894
Duty calls and Christine goes.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.568
I was beginning to think
you wouldn't make it.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.361
I had to go, um...

12:18.530 --> 12:20.323
I had to talk to Nick.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.660
He's gonna be reinstated
in the department

12:23.702 --> 12:25.954
and he's gonna be
the new special investigator.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.290
How is he?
Did he agree?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.460
You look flushed.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.338
The dance
was very stirring.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.007
Usually you're bored.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.383
Did he agree?

12:39.176 --> 12:41.344
- Yeah.
- I can't believe it.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.679
Why not?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.848
After all,
he is my brother.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.683
Well, that never
stood in your way.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.101
Are you siding with him?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.228
Franklin, you should
know better than that.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.066
What did you have
to promise him?

13:20.091 --> 13:22.886
- Hi, Ramon.
- I am thinking...

13:22.928 --> 13:24.721
All right, all right.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.239
Hi, Ed.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.662
Will you get--
Get that animal, please?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.163
Put it at her feet.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.707
Don't smile, Olympia.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.087
Beware the Jabberwocky,
my son!

13:57.128 --> 13:59.422
The jaws that bite,
the claws that catch!

14:02.467 --> 14:05.262
Watch you hands, buddy.
Watch your hands.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.306
- Like that?
- Don't look at me.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.641
Very good. Stay.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.644
Shut up.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.356
Ed, why didn't you use
your apartment?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.607
You've got the light.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.028
Look, I'm making
dinner tonight.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.780
Can I borrow my table?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.616
Sure.

14:27.993 --> 14:31.288
Just...languish there, darling.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.749
Don't molest anything.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.850
Ed.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.351
Want a job?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.854
- What's a job?
- Work. For money.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.274
- Money?
- Yeah.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.276
Do you remember money?

15:01.318 --> 15:02.652
Ha. Yeah, I remember it.

15:02.694 --> 15:03.778
What do you think?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.532
It was irritating to me
that I need money.

15:07.616 --> 15:08.909
I shouldn't need it.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.452
I don't agree.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.621
It's good every once in a while

15:12.662 --> 15:15.707
to get roped into
somebody else's...

15:16.166 --> 15:17.375
You know.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.002
What?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.505
Problem.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.385
For money?

15:28.303 --> 15:29.346
Right.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.900
I'm gonna have
a press conference

15:41.983 --> 15:43.693
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.862
The governor, he's let me
had his best speech writer.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.197
He's gonna write the statement.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.366
The fucking guy is a poet, you know.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.327
I'll have the hardliners
wringing their handkerchiefs out

15:52.369 --> 15:53.578
before I'm through.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.330
The prodigal son
with the right stuff.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.500
Forgive and forget.
For everything there's a season.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.212
How do we face the terrifying
spectacle of Nick Starkey,

16:02.253 --> 16:04.422
what he may do,
what he may not do?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.800
Whoop-de-doo
and la-di-da.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.553
Oh, yeah. Well, anyway,
I want to get going.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.555
I want to start working
on it tonight.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.224
I want to get all
the borough presidents.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.935
I want them standing up there
with me, shoulder to shoulder.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.521
And if I can get that prick
with the scarlet cape,

16:19.562 --> 16:20.730
the cardinal to stand up,

16:20.814 --> 16:22.482
I'm gonna get him up there too.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.693
And you, you're
gonna be to my right.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.777
Now, what I want to do,

16:25.860 --> 16:29.155
I want it to look like
the city is united

16:29.239 --> 16:30.865
in bringing
Nick Starkey back.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.867
See, I don't want it to look
like his brother is bringing him

16:32.909 --> 16:35.036
clean underwear,
or something like that.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.705
Now, I'll take care
of all the questions.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.831
I mean, no matter
how rough they get,

16:37.914 --> 16:39.499
I'll be pious.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.751
And when it's over,
take a break,

16:41.835 --> 16:43.545
let them have a shot at you.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.423
And then give them
some hard talk back.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.009
You know, two or three minutes,
but be conservative.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.094
Very, very conservative.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.139
And if you blow,
blow with dignity.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.854
I'm gonna be dog meat after this.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.522
No, you're not.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.065
If he comes out of this
looking great,

17:04.107 --> 17:05.567
I'm a fool for firing him.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.279
If he blows it, I'm a schmuck
for bringing him back.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.281
If he blows it,
we're all unemployed.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.949
And if he gets the guy,
we're all heroes.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.035
That's the news.
It's like Elizabeth Taylor says:

17:15.118 --> 17:17.037
"There is no deodorant
like success."

17:20.165 --> 17:21.291
What is it?

17:21.499 --> 17:22.959
<i>Captain Alcoa is here.</i>

17:23.043 --> 17:24.169
Shit.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.588
He heard.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.590
OK, send him in.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.510
I won't do it...

17:32.594 --> 17:33.720
Do what?

17:33.803 --> 17:36.222
Hey, don't bull me.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.349
We're all having a bad day, Alcoa.
Nobody needs your volume.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.602
Nick Starkey
is no policeman!

17:40.643 --> 17:42.020
Al, his record
shows otherwise.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.480
He don't belong
in the department.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.647
That's for me to say!

17:44.731 --> 17:47.817
He's like a...
He's fucking a beatnik!

17:47.901 --> 17:49.360
He's got a beatnik mentality.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.739
Well, maybe that's what we need,
is a beatnik.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.991
Oh, sure, sure, seems funny

17:55.033 --> 17:56.534
down here and now.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.620
But it don't feel so fucking funny

17:58.661 --> 17:59.746
in the middle of a murder case

17:59.829 --> 18:01.498
when you're seeing
those girls dead!

18:01.539 --> 18:03.333
Who do you think
you're talking to?

18:03.374 --> 18:04.834
Jesus Christ!

18:04.918 --> 18:08.338
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to!

18:08.421 --> 18:11.216
You think I'm your wife?
You want to fuck me?

18:11.299 --> 18:12.675
Well, don't mess with me.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.179
You mess with me and you better
have a goddamn sense of humor

18:16.221 --> 18:17.639
the size of Lake Michigan

18:17.680 --> 18:19.349
to find something to laugh about.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.185
And if I send you
a rubber duck to work with,

18:22.227 --> 18:23.770
that is the news!

18:23.853 --> 18:26.022
Can you understand that?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.690
Do you understand?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.089
So then...it's true.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.091
It's true.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.013
When?

18:59.389 --> 19:00.515
Tomorrow.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.143
So you get out of here,
and you be a good boy.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.020
And if Nick reports to you,
you treat him like a god.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.063
Do you understand that?

19:07.147 --> 19:08.398
Can you understand that?

19:08.439 --> 19:09.858
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.484
And if he wants anything,
you give it to him.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.571
If he wants your wallet,
you give it to him.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.573
And you keep me posted.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.199
No, no. Never mind trying
to say anything.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.993
Just shut up and get out.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.704
Go on! I'm trying to
have a meeting here.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.182
So...

19:42.348 --> 19:44.434
Did Nick agree
without a fuss?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.353
No.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.942
Well...what do you
have to do?

19:56.613 --> 19:58.740
I had to let him cook dinner
for my wife tonight.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.917
OK.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.342
Come in. Door's open.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.928
Been open for two years.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.482
Hi.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.817
Hi.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.320
What is it, snowing?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.030
A little.

20:39.822 --> 20:40.907
Well...

20:41.824 --> 20:43.576
Take off your clothe--
Coat.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.787
Uh, make yourself comfortable.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.997
I got to change.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.276
How you doing, Sam?

21:17.527 --> 21:20.113
How are you?
- Good.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.180
Shit.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.852
Nick.

22:33.811 --> 22:34.896
Nick.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.356
What is it?

22:36.439 --> 22:37.899
Why did you make me
come here?

22:38.149 --> 22:39.275
I wanted to make you dinner.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.611
You always make me things
that I hate.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.364
I try to.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.074
- Listen.
- What?

22:48.034 --> 22:50.119
The wine.
It's breathing.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.215
I decanted it
an hour and a half ago.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.011
How much did it cost?

23:07.553 --> 23:08.971
Six dollars.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.266
I won't like it. I never like any
wine that costs less than 20.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.645
No matter how good it tastes?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.021
That's right.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.608
I'll pour you a glass.

23:45.508 --> 23:46.759
What do you think?

23:46.843 --> 23:47.844
I hate it.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.714
Here.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.926
This is balsamic vinegar.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.971
Sprinkle some on the octopus.
It's great.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.522
Where did you get that scar?

24:41.856 --> 24:45.902
- Burn from a fire.
- Right. You're a fireman.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.820
Till yesterday.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.697
It's hard to picture.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.411
Burning building.
Everybody else runs out.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.413
You run in.

24:57.497 --> 25:00.208
Basically, it's a maniac's job.

25:06.881 --> 25:10.384
- Marinated eggplant?
- No, thanks.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.349
Have you forgiven Franklin?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.104
For what? Did he do
something wrong?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.315
He betrayed you.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.527
Did he?

25:27.735 --> 25:30.655
He needed a fall guy,
and he gave them you.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.449
Did he?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.618
Yes.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.578
- His own brother?
- That's right.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.540
How should I feel about that?

25:40.790 --> 25:42.583
I guess you should be mad.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.793
Then that's what I am.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.546
I'm mad.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.591
Anything else
I should be mad about?

25:50.633 --> 25:51.926
- Yes.
- What?

25:51.968 --> 25:53.052
Me.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.262
Right.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.972
I should be mad about you.

25:58.266 --> 26:01.227
And that is my fucking curse.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.480
I am...

26:05.189 --> 26:07.692
still mad about you.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.908
I should go.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.661
Yeah.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.330
You should.

26:22.415 --> 26:25.418
You hate the food,
and you married the wrong man.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.503
I'll get my coat.

26:27.587 --> 26:28.629
You might as well, Christine,

26:28.671 --> 26:29.839
because I'm not gonna
sleep with you.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.466
- Not while you're married.
- I'm not gonna sleep with you.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.552
That's right, you're not.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.012
Not if you beg me on your knees.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.597
I may covet my brother's wife,

26:37.680 --> 26:38.848
but I am not gonna boff her.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.349
You have not changed.

26:40.391 --> 26:43.185
Neither have you.
But you should.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.187
Chris...

26:50.318 --> 26:52.028
Haven't you missed me?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.821
Please, don't.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.283
When you close your eyes,
don't you see my face?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.951
Oh. Nick, don't.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.002
How do you make love to him
after me?

27:11.339 --> 27:13.716
How do you get wet?
Do you think about the money?

27:25.645 --> 27:27.355
There was a check.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.856
What?

27:29.315 --> 27:33.361
That last night I saw you.
Two years ago, here.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.739
There was a cancelled
check on the table.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.283
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:39.742 --> 27:43.871
There was a cancelled check
on that table.

27:43.913 --> 27:47.416
Right there.
Made out to my brother, Frank.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.418
After you left, it was gone.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.629
Are you accusing me?

27:51.712 --> 27:52.880
I'm telling you.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.926
Well, you're wrong.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.762
Maybe.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.810
Thanks for stopping by.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.110
About one more minute,
I can take one question.

28:14.151 --> 28:18.989
Mr. Mayor, do you really think
Nick Starkey can expect

28:19.073 --> 28:21.075
the support and respect
of the police department

28:21.117 --> 28:23.202
given his ungraceful
departure of two years ago?

28:23.285 --> 28:28.249
Understand this, there was no hard
evidence of graft. All right?

28:28.290 --> 28:30.418
- What's going to happen to him?
- Just a second, let me finish,

28:30.459 --> 28:31.836
or you can come up here
and do it.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.923
All right. Now,
because he was under a cloud,

28:35.965 --> 28:37.133
we were under a cloud.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.344
So we made, what you might call
a political decision.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.597
And he was wonderful.
He put the department's good

28:43.639 --> 28:44.974
ahead of his good.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.435
Now, he could afford it,
but he knew what he'd destroy.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.186
And I respect him
for that.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.481
And at this moment,
I think he's the obvious choice,

28:52.523 --> 28:54.567
in this dangerous
juncture of time,

28:54.650 --> 28:56.193
to lead the investigation.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.945
Because we have to do something.

28:57.987 --> 29:01.782
And I think that Lieutenant
Starkey can make it happen.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.075
That's all for today.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.494
The show is over.
I've got to go.

29:05.578 --> 29:06.996
Bye-bye.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.628
How do you feel about Starkey
being on the investigation?

29:14.670 --> 29:16.547
How do you feel
about Starkey?

29:16.630 --> 29:17.631
Sir.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.176
Commissioner.
Commissioner Starkey.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.136
How do you feel about
your brother being named

29:22.178 --> 29:23.846
special investigator?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.557
I'm very glad
my brother's been reinstated.

29:26.724 --> 29:30.978
Obviously, I was grieved by his
difficulties of two years ago,

29:31.020 --> 29:33.481
and hoped the day might come
when he could resume his career.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.107
That day has come.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.734
<i>No one is happier than me.</i>

29:37.443 --> 29:39.278
Yeah, you look ecstatic.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.489
<i>...stop this killer.</i>
<i>That was Police Comm--</i>

29:51.874 --> 29:53.167
Cone.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.711
Come in here.

30:06.222 --> 30:07.348
Yes, sir?

30:09.475 --> 30:11.894
When Lieutenant Starkey
reports,

30:11.977 --> 30:13.562
keep him away from me.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.816
Give him Olsen's old office.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.236
Lieutenant Starkey's
already reported, sir.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.783
- He has?
- Yes, sir.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.827
And he didn't like
Olsen's old office,

30:27.910 --> 30:30.246
so he took the big one
down at the end of the hall.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.377
He doesn't like Olsen's office?

30:36.919 --> 30:38.754
He said the light was no good.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.714
What light?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.758
You know, sir, the sunlight.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.593
Sunlight?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.763
W-what's he need sunlight for?

30:48.222 --> 30:50.140
- For Ed.
- For Ed?

30:50.349 --> 30:51.642
Yes, sir.

30:56.689 --> 30:57.982
Who's Ed?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.525
The painter.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.573
That office doesn't
need to be painted.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.741
He's not that kind of painter,
captain.

31:07.783 --> 31:11.328
He's a--
You know, he paints paintings.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.122
He's an artist.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.171
What's going on here?

31:34.685 --> 31:35.936
Captain.

31:35.978 --> 31:36.979
<i>You told him.</i>

31:37.062 --> 31:38.480
Yeah.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.317
Told him about the painter?

31:41.358 --> 31:42.401
Yeah.

31:43.611 --> 31:46.614
I got a sweet tooth for this shit.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.865
I love it.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.996
Captain.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.666
So, what's the prisoner's name?

32:21.523 --> 32:22.983
Hi Butch.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.401
Captain Alcoa.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.820
You want some espresso?

32:33.577 --> 32:35.162
Do I hear crickets?

32:35.204 --> 32:36.288
Yeah, it's the tape.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.373
Ain't it great.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.999
Who's that?

32:40.042 --> 32:42.044
- That's Ed.
- The painter?

32:42.544 --> 32:43.712
That's right.

32:43.796 --> 32:44.838
You want sugar?

32:49.718 --> 32:51.053
Why's the furniture in the hall?

32:52.596 --> 32:54.848
I didn't want it.
I wanted space.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.225
Did you miss me?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.561
I don't have any place
to put that furniture

32:59.603 --> 33:00.688
if it's not in here.

33:00.729 --> 33:01.897
I don't want it.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.732
But I'll tell you
what I do want.

33:03.774 --> 33:06.443
All reports, photos,
news accounts,

33:06.527 --> 33:09.697
background of any kind
on every one of the murders.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.032
In order of priority, everything
on that last murder first.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.284
Second priority, everything
on the very first murder.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.245
You must have a shitload
of stuff by now.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.251
We do.

33:22.376 --> 33:23.919
It's like a library.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.547
It's in 202.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.924
Then leave it in 202.
I'll go to it.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.260
OK.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.346
And, put Ed on the payroll.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.516
- As what?
- My assistant.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.810
No, no.
I'll assign you an assistant.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.521
I need Ed.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.692
OK.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.778
And, uh...

33:51.113 --> 33:53.615
I need an NEC computer...

33:54.616 --> 33:55.784
Lotus Agenda.

33:59.455 --> 34:02.041
We have about five Bedbecks.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.126
Bedbecks' no good.
I need the NEC.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.961
I need the NEC.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.966
OK.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.845
You're not drinking
your espresso, <i>Mon capitaine.</i>

34:15.095 --> 34:16.138
Oh, well.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.223
I've got to go.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.558
Where are you going?

34:19.641 --> 34:21.310
I'll be back about 3.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.811
Where would I be going?

34:23.687 --> 34:24.855
It's a beautiful day.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.274
I put on my best dress...

34:27.316 --> 34:28.942
to go to a funeral.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.861
Hang in there, Ed.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.154
OK.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.498
Up yours, copper.

34:53.008 --> 34:57.846
But we must meet calamity
with introspection.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.976
Alison Hawkins was a member
of the Hawkins family.

35:03.018 --> 35:07.981
She is gone,
but the Hawkins family remains.

35:08.023 --> 35:12.528
The family remains, and
something of Alison remains.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.821
In them.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.866
In each of them,
and in all of them.

35:18.826 --> 35:23.831
You are in shock now,
and you are in pain.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.291
When this coffin
is shouldered and

35:26.375 --> 35:29.169
carried from this church,

35:30.087 --> 35:32.589
grieve your grief.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.716
Let it go.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.677
Trust in God.

35:36.718 --> 35:39.888
Grieve. Repair.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.306
Live.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.061
Open your hymnals,
please.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.406
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.700
- Fine. I'm fine.
- Sorry.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.047
Do I know you?

37:37.673 --> 37:38.799
No.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.971
You're Nick Starkey.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.180
Yeah.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.431
I know your brother.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.475
Good for you.

37:48.517 --> 37:49.851
Are you following me?

37:49.935 --> 37:50.978
Yeah.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.104
Why?

37:52.354 --> 37:53.939
You were the prettiest one
at the funeral.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.693
Can I buy you, uh,
some hot chocolate?

38:00.654 --> 38:01.697
Sure.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.203
So, uh...

38:08.870 --> 38:12.332
You usually go from
funerals to ice skating?

38:12.457 --> 38:13.709
No.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.046
Well...makes sense to me.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.382
- It does?
- Yeah.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.636
What's funny?

38:25.887 --> 38:28.056
My father thinks you're a genius.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.266
I am.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.316
You know...let's forget this.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.235
You don't want to question me?

38:41.194 --> 38:43.238
- No.
- What's the matter?

38:44.614 --> 38:46.033
Nothing.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.410
In a hundred years,
we'll all be dead.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.037
So?

38:50.495 --> 38:51.830
So...

38:53.832 --> 38:56.376
My friend Alison and I
spent New Year's Eve together.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.004
I keep...

38:59.087 --> 39:01.506
going over our conversation
in my head.

39:01.590 --> 39:04.051
We didn't really say
anything to one another.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.095
It was like most
conversations, I guess.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.264
Except it happened to be
her last.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.684
And then today...

39:12.768 --> 39:14.603
that funeral, it--

39:17.064 --> 39:19.483
I just kept thinking...

39:19.608 --> 39:21.610
how much of life is wasted.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.447
I mean, we're sitting here.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.240
We're talking to each other.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.703
I mean, shouldn't we be
really talking to each other?

39:32.621 --> 39:33.663
All right.

39:35.791 --> 39:36.875
All right.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.757
I, uh, saw my brother's wife,
Christine, last night.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.300
And, uh...

39:45.425 --> 39:48.595
she and I were
an item at one time.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.556
And, so it was a
very painful evening.

39:53.225 --> 39:56.853
And, uh--
And now, today I see you.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.313
And...

39:58.355 --> 40:00.649
I find you very...

40:01.274 --> 40:02.567
attractive.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.112
And I'm feeling vulnerable

40:05.153 --> 40:07.739
because of last night, and...

40:07.823 --> 40:09.408
so my feeling is...

40:10.325 --> 40:12.327
My instinct as a man is,

40:12.369 --> 40:15.205
I don't wanna ask you
a lot of pushy questions.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.834
Because I want you to like me.

40:20.836 --> 40:21.920
In fact,

40:22.003 --> 40:24.005
how real do you want
this conversation to get,

40:24.089 --> 40:25.799
because...

40:25.841 --> 40:27.968
saying these things out loud

40:28.009 --> 40:32.681
has made me wanna
go to the next step...

40:32.848 --> 40:34.182
and say to you:

40:35.392 --> 40:38.395
This restaurant's a 5 minute walk

40:38.478 --> 40:40.647
from seven hotels.

40:42.691 --> 40:43.859
It is?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.402
It is.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.447
And I'd like to...

40:48.613 --> 40:50.073
get a room...

40:50.157 --> 40:51.283
in one of them...

40:52.826 --> 40:54.202
right now.

40:54.286 --> 40:55.996
Take you there.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.039
You would?

40:58.248 --> 40:59.499
Yeah, I would.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.215
What do you say?

41:07.924 --> 41:10.177
In a hundred years,
we'll all be dead.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.513
What do you say?

41:26.234 --> 41:27.527
But...

41:28.528 --> 41:29.529
Yeah...

41:31.823 --> 41:33.783
Just exactly how old are you?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.704
- 23.
- Oh.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.916
Is something missing?

41:43.126 --> 41:44.753
Nothing's missing.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.005
This is what happens.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.423
What are you talking about?

41:50.217 --> 41:52.010
I knew when I came
back down into this world,

41:52.093 --> 41:54.596
I'd start having weird
behavior like this.

41:54.638 --> 41:55.722
Like what?

41:57.432 --> 41:59.184
23 years old.

41:59.351 --> 42:00.936
Oh, shh. So what?

42:04.564 --> 42:05.857
And look, you're on top.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.715
I've got to get out of here.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.681
So go.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.377
What if I had a heart attack
and they found me with you?

43:09.879 --> 43:11.172
I'm speechless.

43:23.310 --> 43:27.063
So...where are we
going now?

43:29.024 --> 43:30.692
Where are we going?

43:30.775 --> 43:33.194
How do you figure that?

43:33.236 --> 43:34.529
Listen...

43:35.822 --> 43:37.490
I haven't felt safe.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.536
I feel safe right now.

43:44.164 --> 43:46.291
Let me have a little more of that.

43:50.712 --> 43:51.921
All right.

43:52.672 --> 43:56.176
Show me where
Alison Hawkins lived.

44:14.277 --> 44:15.987
Which window was hers?

44:20.617 --> 44:21.785
You see that right there?

44:21.868 --> 44:22.952
Next to the lights.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.498
Come on, I wanna take a look.

44:44.474 --> 44:45.600
Thanks.

45:27.726 --> 45:30.061
Everybody knows where I live.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.939
I kept having these
nightmares last night.

45:33.648 --> 45:35.775
I mean, I know my house
is safe, supposedly.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.652
But it's giving me the creeps.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.613
Everybody knows where I live.

45:42.157 --> 45:44.451
I'm gonna have to
get back to the precinct.

45:44.492 --> 45:45.994
I've got to work tonight.

45:46.703 --> 45:48.288
I understand.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.916
You can stay at my apartment,
if you want.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.169
You'd be by yourself.

45:54.210 --> 45:55.378
Could I?

45:55.837 --> 45:56.921
Sure.

45:57.005 --> 45:58.089
That would be great.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.843
Um, I'll, um...

46:01.926 --> 46:04.053
call my father
and make an excuse.

46:05.013 --> 46:06.765
- Good.
- Thanks.

46:49.432 --> 46:50.683
Ed, why are you still here?

46:51.684 --> 46:53.978
Just trying to get the hang of this.

46:55.104 --> 46:56.731
Well, go home.

46:56.815 --> 46:58.858
This is, uh, Bernadette.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.277
Bernadette, this is Ed.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.196
He lives in my building.

47:04.322 --> 47:05.782
She's gonna stay
in my place tonight,

47:05.865 --> 47:07.158
so would you show her in?

47:07.784 --> 47:08.868
Sure.

47:10.203 --> 47:11.204
Hi, Ed.

47:11.538 --> 47:12.664
Hi.

47:14.082 --> 47:15.250
Thanks.

47:15.291 --> 47:16.501
You're welcome.

47:23.091 --> 47:24.259
So long.

47:24.717 --> 47:26.886
So, go, go.

47:26.928 --> 47:28.596
Ed, I'll see you in the morning.

47:29.222 --> 47:30.265
OK.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.908
Where are you going?

49:11.991 --> 49:13.284
For a walk.

49:13.368 --> 49:14.744
Where?

49:14.827 --> 49:16.162
Nowhere.

49:16.204 --> 49:17.914
To get away from you.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.127
What have you figured out
about the case?

49:26.297 --> 49:29.050
This guy, whoever he is,
he's fabulous with locks.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.929
In seven of these cases,
the guy picked the lock.

49:33.012 --> 49:36.683
Some of these locks were
supposed to be unpickable.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.309
What else?

49:38.393 --> 49:42.438
He's not just smart with locks,
he's just smart.

49:42.522 --> 49:45.525
Very bright in
a useless kind of way.

49:46.776 --> 49:49.946
Cracked as an old teacup.

49:50.029 --> 49:52.156
You don't get away pulling
11 separate murders

49:52.240 --> 49:54.409
unless you got a brain
like a Swiss watch.

49:55.576 --> 49:58.746
You don't murder 11 women
unless you're plain fucking crazy.

49:58.830 --> 50:01.124
Or you haven't
figured out the motive.

50:02.417 --> 50:03.918
I haven't figured out the motive.

50:04.085 --> 50:05.586
That's a separate problem.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.797
I mean, I know the motive.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.007
What is it?

50:10.383 --> 50:12.593
This man has
a lot of anger towards women.

50:14.178 --> 50:15.763
That's fucking brilliant.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.099
Must've been his mother.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.768
Blue ribbon's
an interesting touch.

50:21.144 --> 50:22.770
I mean, blue ribbon...

50:24.105 --> 50:25.565
It's an award.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.402
Maybe the mother...

50:31.029 --> 50:34.532
rewarded the kid with
something that strangled him.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.035
Maybe the constant
rewarding by the mother

50:37.118 --> 50:40.580
was the thing that caused
the feeling of being strangled.

50:42.290 --> 50:44.500
Bet this guy overachieves
like gangbusters.

50:45.293 --> 50:47.003
Hey! I'm walking, here.

50:47.086 --> 50:48.129
What are you, crazy?

50:48.171 --> 50:49.297
"Prime Cut."

50:50.757 --> 50:51.758
Prime!

50:52.425 --> 50:53.760
What are you talking about?

50:56.095 --> 50:58.598
I'm about to know when he's
going to kill the next girl.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.308
- When?
- I'll call you in an hour

51:00.349 --> 51:02.060
when I got it figured.

51:06.647 --> 51:08.274
Listen, Frank...

51:10.026 --> 51:12.695
You and me, we got something
in common with the murderer.

51:12.779 --> 51:14.155
We do?

51:15.281 --> 51:16.491
Maybe you do.

51:17.075 --> 51:18.993
Just like him,
we've got a mother.

51:19.035 --> 51:21.496
Don't go comparing
our mother to his.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.831
Just like his mother,
our mother had an effect--

51:23.873 --> 51:26.375
No, don't you say
a word about our mother!

51:26.459 --> 51:30.004
You see, she's dead, and we're still
fighting over her.

51:30.046 --> 51:31.089
She had a big effect--

51:31.172 --> 51:33.007
Get back to talking
about the case.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.009
Like with your wife.

51:35.093 --> 51:36.677
Don't bring my wife into this!

51:37.011 --> 51:38.096
I'm warning you.

51:38.179 --> 51:39.764
You're right, it's
really about our mother.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.974
Frank, I got one thing
to say to you.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.436
And it's hard, but I got to say it.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.230
And if you can accept it,

51:47.939 --> 51:50.358
a lot of other shit's
gonna fall into place.

51:54.529 --> 51:56.739
Frank, Mom loved me
more than you.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.911
That's why I took
the fall for you, Frank.

52:02.703 --> 52:05.164
I wish you'd just fucking die.

53:12.773 --> 53:14.275
Hello.

53:15.067 --> 53:16.152
Hello.

53:17.945 --> 53:19.488
Bernadette, isn't it?

53:19.572 --> 53:20.948
Yes, yes.

53:21.073 --> 53:22.283
Mrs. Starkey.

53:23.618 --> 53:26.704
I think we met at the, uh,
mayor's birthday party.

53:26.787 --> 53:28.623
And at the opera also, I think.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.208
And now, here.

53:30.374 --> 53:31.709
And now, here.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.669
- Would you like to come in?
- No.

53:35.922 --> 53:38.049
- He's not here.
- Who?

53:39.634 --> 53:40.801
Nick.

53:41.510 --> 53:42.637
Right.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.431
No, I think I'll just be going

53:45.473 --> 53:46.974
before there's a traffic jam.

54:00.947 --> 54:02.657
Oh, my God.

54:20.049 --> 54:21.509
Hey, Cone.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.303
You know what
a prime number is?

54:24.345 --> 54:25.513
Any number...

54:26.681 --> 54:27.765
What is it?

54:27.848 --> 54:31.852
Any number that can only be
divided by one and itself.

54:32.687 --> 54:33.938
Whatever you say.

54:35.439 --> 54:39.777
There are 12 prime numbers
possible out of 31 days.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.532
These are the dates of the murders.

54:47.326 --> 54:49.370
Eleven prime numbers.

54:49.829 --> 54:51.289
What's the 12th?

54:51.706 --> 54:53.082
It's five.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.043
What's today?

54:56.877 --> 54:58.212
January 4th.

54:58.421 --> 54:59.505
Then it's tomorrow night.

54:59.547 --> 55:01.841
He's gonna kill the next girl
tomorrow night.

55:01.966 --> 55:03.134
Where?

55:06.304 --> 55:07.763
I don't know.

55:08.889 --> 55:10.725
Well, I better leave you to figure.

55:11.392 --> 55:12.601
You're the real thing.

55:16.022 --> 55:17.481
You're a real shamus.

55:24.071 --> 55:26.282
Alcoa, I know when the guy's
gonna hit again.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.326
You got to give me
your cooperation here.

55:28.409 --> 55:31.287
Fuck you!
And don't even look at me.

55:31.787 --> 55:34.290
I don't work for you,
you work for me.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.791
You think you can
come in my office,

55:35.875 --> 55:37.835
stand on my face
and tell me the news

55:37.918 --> 55:39.837
like I'm some
monkey-do lieutenant?

55:39.920 --> 55:41.297
Fuck you!

55:41.380 --> 55:42.965
You are not a policeman!

55:43.049 --> 55:46.260
I am a fucking policeman!

55:46.719 --> 55:47.803
Get it...

55:47.887 --> 55:49.764
You dilettante fuck?

55:51.849 --> 55:54.018
No matter what the mayor says!

55:56.604 --> 55:59.815
Ahem. I'm gonna need
a backup unit tomorrow night.

55:59.899 --> 56:02.401
On call. Maybe all night.

56:02.610 --> 56:05.946
If I ever get my hands
on a shred of paper

56:06.030 --> 56:08.949
that proves that you were
on the take back when,

56:08.991 --> 56:10.368
I will delight in getting

56:10.451 --> 56:12.203
the charcoal for the barbecue.

56:12.286 --> 56:15.956
I'm gonna need the team in
the van with the motor running.

56:16.457 --> 56:18.125
Tomorrow's the night.

56:18.292 --> 56:19.752
That's when he's gonna hit.

56:21.087 --> 56:22.922
Maybe for the last time.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.049
Where?

56:25.424 --> 56:26.967
I don't know yet.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.150
<i>Yes, Captain Alcoa?</i>

56:43.234 --> 56:45.653
Get me Emergency Service Unit.

57:02.044 --> 57:04.839
So, Christine, I understand
you had dinner with Nick.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.424
- Yes.
- I wanna know what happened.

57:06.507 --> 57:08.259
I mean, did he say he was
gonna do anything further,

57:08.342 --> 57:11.303
or talk to anybody further
about the scandal that happened

57:11.345 --> 57:12.555
about two years back?

57:12.638 --> 57:15.683
I mean, not that there's
anything to talk about.

57:15.766 --> 57:17.351
He thinks there's a check.

57:19.395 --> 57:20.938
- A check?
- Yeah.

57:21.021 --> 57:22.982
A cancelled check,
made out to you, Frank.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.194
From who?

57:27.236 --> 57:29.655
Well, it would be a--
A crooked road,

57:29.697 --> 57:32.575
Eamon, but I think it would
be traced back to you.

57:35.995 --> 57:37.329
Does Nick have this check?

57:37.371 --> 57:39.206
No, I don't even think
he's looking for it.

57:39.790 --> 57:40.958
You don't?

57:41.041 --> 57:42.084
No, I don't think so.

57:42.168 --> 57:43.669
I think he's much more
interested right now

57:43.711 --> 57:45.045
in your daughter.

57:51.844 --> 57:53.596
What are you talking about?

57:54.013 --> 57:55.514
Oh, you don't understand
what I'm saying?

57:55.556 --> 57:57.057
I'm sorry, it--
Picture it.

57:57.183 --> 57:58.392
Just-- Well...

57:58.684 --> 58:00.978
look at your cigar
and think of your daughter.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.280
Don't bother to get up.

58:11.363 --> 58:13.657
It's all right.
Roger will see me home.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.829
What are you doing?

58:18.913 --> 58:20.498
I'm checking into a hotel, Frank...

58:20.581 --> 58:22.917
and out of the whorehouse.

58:28.214 --> 58:29.924
- Lovely meal, thank you.
- Thanks.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.343
Good night. All done.

58:51.195 --> 58:52.613
It's here.

58:53.781 --> 58:55.032
What's here?

58:56.158 --> 58:58.744
Tomorrow night is here.

59:04.792 --> 59:08.128
February, March,

59:08.796 --> 59:11.507
April, May,

59:11.840 --> 59:14.635
June, July,

59:14.718 --> 59:17.346
August, September,

59:17.429 --> 59:20.391
October, November,

59:20.474 --> 59:21.767
December...

59:25.354 --> 59:27.523
January.

1:00:15.362 --> 1:00:19.158
These are the rooms

1:00:19.199 --> 1:00:22.911
where each murder
was committed.

1:00:33.547 --> 1:00:34.923
Where?

1:01:33.941 --> 1:01:35.275
Hey, Hal, do you
got my paper?

1:01:35.359 --> 1:01:37.111
Uh, no paper
for 12-C, sir.

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:40.114
Let me take a look
and see if my paper's there.

1:02:41.091 --> 1:02:42.926
Can you do a whole
part of town this way?

1:02:43.010 --> 1:02:44.136
Sure.

1:02:45.053 --> 1:02:46.805
You wanna see the big picture?

1:02:52.144 --> 1:02:53.520
Oh, God.

1:02:56.690 --> 1:02:58.859
Nick, can this voodoo
and meet me out front.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:01.236
There's been another murder,
but we got the son of a bitch.

1:03:06.492 --> 1:03:07.701
Tonight?

1:03:48.408 --> 1:03:49.701
Hello, captain.

1:03:50.619 --> 1:03:51.829
Hello, sir.

1:03:52.746 --> 1:03:55.207
The woman's upstairs,
named Lana Pico.

1:03:55.249 --> 1:03:57.042
Strangled in her own apartment.

1:03:57.084 --> 1:04:00.128
He strangled her,
walked to the dining room...

1:04:00.212 --> 1:04:02.548
jumped right through the fucking window.

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:12.432
Look at that.
The son of a bitch has the ribbon

1:04:12.474 --> 1:04:14.101
right in his hand.

1:04:14.142 --> 1:04:16.270
He's gonna make a great picture
for the <i>Post.</i>

1:04:17.855 --> 1:04:19.481
How'd he get in?

1:04:19.565 --> 1:04:21.984
Broke in through a window
opposite the air shaft.

1:04:22.067 --> 1:04:23.610
- Broke in?
- Yeah.

1:04:23.694 --> 1:04:25.487
Window was gated,
he kicked it in,

1:04:25.571 --> 1:04:27.239
and waited for her
in the bedroom.

1:04:32.870 --> 1:04:34.746
Wait. Nobody gets through.

1:04:34.788 --> 1:04:36.707
- Can we just get down there?
- I'm sorry.

1:04:56.852 --> 1:04:57.978
Hello, Alcoa.

1:04:58.020 --> 1:04:59.187
Hello, sir.

1:05:01.690 --> 1:05:02.900
And you are?

1:05:02.983 --> 1:05:04.276
Detective Reilly, sir.

1:05:04.318 --> 1:05:05.652
Good to meet you, Reilly.

1:05:06.653 --> 1:05:08.697
- Killed himself, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.700
- Hi, Nick.
- Not him.

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:13.035
Hi.

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:14.369
Pretty ironic, huh?

1:05:16.830 --> 1:05:19.082
- What?
- Well, he killed himself.

1:05:19.166 --> 1:05:21.793
We didn't need Sherlock Holmes
after all.

1:05:24.922 --> 1:05:26.673
Can we see you over here,
commissioner?

1:05:44.358 --> 1:05:46.068
That's my father's car.

1:05:46.193 --> 1:05:47.527
All right. Hey.

1:05:51.907 --> 1:05:54.409
- Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing here?

1:05:54.493 --> 1:05:55.535
What are you doing?
Never mind.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:56.870
I heard, I heard.

1:05:56.912 --> 1:05:57.955
We'll talk about it later.

1:05:58.038 --> 1:05:59.873
Now, you just get out of here
before they take your picture.

1:05:59.915 --> 1:06:01.041
What's the matter with you?

1:06:01.083 --> 1:06:02.376
Would you do what I say?

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:03.835
You get out of here.

1:06:03.877 --> 1:06:05.879
Don't become a liability,
little girl.

1:06:14.554 --> 1:06:16.556
Apparently, he just jumped, sir.

1:06:20.018 --> 1:06:23.730
Oh, my God.
There he is.

1:06:24.022 --> 1:06:25.232
It's--

1:06:25.357 --> 1:06:29.111
A whole city is frightened
to death for a year...

1:06:29.194 --> 1:06:31.196
because of just one guy.

1:06:31.613 --> 1:06:33.323
Well, thank God that's over.

1:06:33.407 --> 1:06:34.491
Maybe.

1:06:35.033 --> 1:06:36.743
What do you mean maybe?

1:06:36.910 --> 1:06:38.328
I don't think this is the man.

1:06:38.745 --> 1:06:40.580
What?
He strangled a woman,

1:06:40.664 --> 1:06:41.748
he's got the ribbon in his hand.

1:06:41.832 --> 1:06:43.583
What the hell are you talking about?

1:06:45.002 --> 1:06:46.586
Why did he kill himself?

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:49.256
How the fuck do I know?

1:06:49.756 --> 1:06:51.258
He murders 11 women.

1:06:51.425 --> 1:06:52.884
No problem.

1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:54.720
He murders one more...

1:06:55.012 --> 1:06:57.931
he feels so bad,
he jumps out the window?

1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:01.268
I don't buy it.

1:07:02.310 --> 1:07:03.729
And why did he break
in the window gate?

1:07:03.770 --> 1:07:04.855
He never broke
anything before,

1:07:04.938 --> 1:07:06.773
he just picked the lock.

1:07:07.232 --> 1:07:10.027
And then there's the date.
Not a prime number.

1:07:10.110 --> 1:07:11.278
It doesn't figure.

1:07:11.319 --> 1:07:14.698
Let me tell you something,
life is like that sometimes.

1:07:14.823 --> 1:07:16.867
You were wrong, that's all.

1:07:17.993 --> 1:07:20.245
I'd like to take a look
at the apartment.

1:07:22.247 --> 1:07:24.082
You wanna see the apartment,
commissioner?

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.418
I'll be up in a minute.

1:07:32.549 --> 1:07:34.718
Eamon, could you take
a look at this?

1:07:34.801 --> 1:07:35.969
What is it?

1:07:36.178 --> 1:07:37.929
A statement for the press.

1:07:38.805 --> 1:07:39.973
You gonna make it?

1:07:40.182 --> 1:07:41.224
Yes.

1:07:42.768 --> 1:07:43.852
All right.

1:07:51.610 --> 1:07:54.488
What's the story?
Think they'll get this straight?

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:56.281
It's all over.
It's all over.

1:07:56.323 --> 1:07:58.909
The commissioner--
It's over. It's over.

1:07:58.992 --> 1:08:01.119
The commissioner
will have a statement for you.

1:08:01.203 --> 1:08:03.288
- Can we leave?
- Sure.

1:08:04.414 --> 1:08:05.665
Excuse me.

1:08:11.338 --> 1:08:13.507
Commissioner
has a statement for you.

1:08:13.924 --> 1:08:17.385
Mr. Commissioner, rumor has it
that this is the strangler.

1:08:17.469 --> 1:08:18.762
Why was the mayor here tonight?

1:08:18.845 --> 1:08:19.888
Rumor has it.

1:08:19.971 --> 1:08:21.098
Tonight...

1:08:22.390 --> 1:08:24.184
comes to an end...

1:08:24.226 --> 1:08:25.936
12 months of fear.

1:08:35.821 --> 1:08:37.405
- See you, Nick.
- Thanks.

1:08:59.136 --> 1:09:00.595
All right, I'm a fireman!

1:09:15.277 --> 1:09:16.403
Jesus!

1:09:21.867 --> 1:09:22.951
What are you doing here?

1:09:24.411 --> 1:09:25.495
Ed let me in.

1:09:28.582 --> 1:09:29.958
Well, he was wrong to do that.

1:09:32.085 --> 1:09:33.211
Nick, what's wrong?

1:09:33.295 --> 1:09:34.421
I'm very tired.

1:09:38.049 --> 1:09:39.384
Why don't you come here
and sit down?

1:09:39.426 --> 1:09:40.552
No!

1:09:41.761 --> 1:09:44.264
They want you, they need you.
The rest of the time?

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:50.729
- Can I help you?
- You?

1:09:50.770 --> 1:09:52.522
You're the mayor's daughter.

1:09:53.690 --> 1:09:56.651
Do a number on him,
but I wouldn't bother.

1:09:58.528 --> 1:09:59.863
What are you talking about?

1:10:03.116 --> 1:10:04.993
Don't you get it?

1:10:05.076 --> 1:10:07.120
This wasn't it.
That wasn't him.

1:10:07.162 --> 1:10:08.288
Then who was that?

1:10:08.330 --> 1:10:11.124
Some guy!
Some other crazy.

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.629
Tomorrow night...

1:10:15.670 --> 1:10:16.963
while your father and my brother

1:10:17.005 --> 1:10:19.966
and all the other slobs who only
care about the way it looks,

1:10:20.050 --> 1:10:22.260
and don't give a shit about
how it actually is,

1:10:22.302 --> 1:10:25.555
while they're all slapping
themselves on the back...

1:10:26.139 --> 1:10:28.183
The January Man...

1:10:28.266 --> 1:10:30.810
is gonna get his January girl.

1:10:32.270 --> 1:10:33.605
So stop him.

1:10:34.981 --> 1:10:37.776
- I've been fired.
- So solve it anyway.

1:10:41.821 --> 1:10:43.823
Nick, I woke up here today.

1:10:44.449 --> 1:10:45.825
I saw how you live,

1:10:45.909 --> 1:10:47.994
I see what you like around you.

1:10:48.995 --> 1:10:51.164
I understand you wanna
run away from these people.

1:10:51.248 --> 1:10:52.624
I understand.

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:55.669
It's their responsibility.

1:10:55.877 --> 1:10:57.003
No.

1:10:57.170 --> 1:10:59.214
They don't know
what that means.

1:11:06.888 --> 1:11:08.014
I'm tired.

1:11:08.348 --> 1:11:09.599
I know.

1:11:10.016 --> 1:11:11.434
I know you are.

1:11:13.103 --> 1:11:15.272
So we're gonna go to bed.

1:11:15.355 --> 1:11:16.356
OK?

1:11:21.194 --> 1:11:22.904
And then we'll sleep.

1:11:24.030 --> 1:11:27.450
And then tomorrow...
after a good breakfast...

1:11:27.534 --> 1:11:29.869
you're gonna catch the killer...

1:11:29.911 --> 1:11:31.246
and save the girl.

1:11:32.497 --> 1:11:33.748
OK?

1:11:35.166 --> 1:11:37.127
OK.

1:11:39.754 --> 1:11:42.007
How old did you
say you were?

1:11:42.048 --> 1:11:43.717
Shut up.

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:46.052
Hundred years,
we'll all be dead.

1:11:47.429 --> 1:11:49.222
The stars will still be shining.

1:11:55.603 --> 1:11:57.397
The stars...

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:03.236
Of course.

1:12:03.403 --> 1:12:05.405
In all the constellations.

1:12:05.488 --> 1:12:09.617
<i>At this time of year,</i>
<i>Virgo has just become visible</i>

1:12:09.701 --> 1:12:11.536
<i>in the Eastern sky.</i>

1:12:11.578 --> 1:12:12.746
I love this.

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:14.039
<i>The recent appearance</i>
<i>of Halley's comet...</i>

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:15.415
Time is running out, Nick.

1:12:15.457 --> 1:12:17.667
<i>...named after an English</i>
<i>astronomer, Edmund Halley...</i>

1:12:18.418 --> 1:12:19.669
In order to be brilliant,

1:12:19.753 --> 1:12:21.880
you got to be in touch
with the universe.

1:12:22.922 --> 1:12:25.342
<i>Halley's comet swings</i>
<i>across our skies</i>

1:12:25.425 --> 1:12:28.136
<i>once every 75 or 76 years.</i>

1:12:36.478 --> 1:12:38.188
That wasn't the guy last night.

1:12:41.649 --> 1:12:43.151
Yes, it was.

1:12:44.778 --> 1:12:46.112
Don't you read the paper?

1:12:46.154 --> 1:12:47.739
The commissioner called me himself

1:12:47.781 --> 1:12:49.866
to say the case is closed.

1:12:50.408 --> 1:12:53.328
He made it clear that
I should give you abuse.

1:12:54.704 --> 1:12:56.039
Shitwork.

1:12:56.956 --> 1:12:58.458
So you'd resign.

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:01.878
I don't think he even wants
you in the fire department.

1:13:02.003 --> 1:13:03.380
Why are you telling me this?

1:13:03.713 --> 1:13:06.049
Because I don't like you.

1:13:06.132 --> 1:13:08.301
There's no place for you here.

1:13:13.765 --> 1:13:15.100
But I respect you.

1:13:16.351 --> 1:13:17.560
It's like the army.

1:13:17.644 --> 1:13:19.938
Wartime hero, peacetime, fuckup.

1:13:20.647 --> 1:13:21.815
That's you.

1:13:22.774 --> 1:13:24.651
Transfer back to
the fire department.

1:13:24.734 --> 1:13:27.195
I ain't got the stomach
to be your brother's stooge.

1:13:27.278 --> 1:13:28.655
I need a backup team.

1:13:29.239 --> 1:13:30.657
Maybe a decoy.

1:13:30.698 --> 1:13:32.617
I need your help
for 12 more hours,

1:13:32.659 --> 1:13:33.743
and then I'll go back to the farm.

1:13:33.827 --> 1:13:36.329
I can't.
I can't, even if I wanted to.

1:13:36.371 --> 1:13:37.497
Don't give me that, skipper.

1:13:37.539 --> 1:13:39.999
I can't get Emergency Service.

1:13:40.250 --> 1:13:42.502
The commissioner
says from now on,

1:13:42.544 --> 1:13:44.546
all ES orders go through him.

1:13:44.629 --> 1:13:46.923
And I ain't gonna put a decoy
out on the street

1:13:47.006 --> 1:13:48.466
without backup.

1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:55.265
All right, all right.

1:13:56.850 --> 1:13:58.643
You got what you got.

1:13:58.685 --> 1:14:00.854
And that's all the support
you're gonna get.

1:14:00.937 --> 1:14:03.189
I'll look the other way
till tomorrow.

1:14:03.398 --> 1:14:07.277
And then I'll expect
a request for transfer.

1:14:07.610 --> 1:14:09.070
And in the meantime,

1:14:09.195 --> 1:14:12.031
unless you see a man
strangling a woman,

1:14:12.157 --> 1:14:14.033
don't call for backup.

1:14:14.909 --> 1:14:16.870
Because it ain't gonna come.

1:14:25.503 --> 1:14:28.047
- Can you just lift your hair?
- Sure.

1:14:31.217 --> 1:14:32.719
How's that feel?

1:14:34.721 --> 1:14:35.763
OK.

1:14:38.391 --> 1:14:39.851
Hello.

1:14:48.568 --> 1:14:49.652
Ready?

1:14:54.407 --> 1:14:56.659
- Feel anything?
- Nope.

1:14:56.743 --> 1:14:59.871
I like attention as much
as the next girl, but...

1:14:59.913 --> 1:15:01.247
No. It's fine.

1:15:01.289 --> 1:15:03.082
Actually, it digs in
a little bit right here.

1:15:03.166 --> 1:15:05.084
All right, I'll put
some tape over that.

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:06.377
All right.

1:15:07.212 --> 1:15:09.297
There's a puzzle in the computer
I've got to sort out.

1:15:09.506 --> 1:15:11.299
Let's get downtown.

1:15:11.424 --> 1:15:12.675
All right.

1:15:13.927 --> 1:15:15.053
Here we go.

1:15:18.556 --> 1:15:20.099
Can you mark the 11 buildings

1:15:20.183 --> 1:15:21.601
where the murders took place.

1:15:39.369 --> 1:15:41.579
Now, can you make the rest
of the city disappear

1:15:41.621 --> 1:15:43.206
and just leave the dots.

1:16:01.474 --> 1:16:02.767
Virgo.

1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:05.478
Stars.

1:16:05.603 --> 1:16:07.313
Ed, there's a star missing.

1:16:07.355 --> 1:16:09.566
Find it.
Get a star chart to scale.

1:16:09.649 --> 1:16:11.109
Find it,
superimpose it on the map,

1:16:11.150 --> 1:16:12.777
then we'll know
the building. Find it.

1:16:13.403 --> 1:16:15.154
OK, now...

1:16:15.238 --> 1:16:16.698
we got one more problem.

1:16:18.908 --> 1:16:21.578
Which window on which floor.

1:16:21.661 --> 1:16:23.454
You got all that
into the computer, right?

1:16:23.997 --> 1:16:25.832
- All right, Ed.
- Yep.

1:16:26.749 --> 1:16:28.418
I'll be right back with the stars.

1:16:28.501 --> 1:16:29.877
Great.

1:16:29.961 --> 1:16:31.379
Very good, Eddie.

1:16:32.505 --> 1:16:34.549
OK.
He likes to fill in squares.

1:16:34.674 --> 1:16:36.551
Let's fill in the murder windows.

1:16:39.012 --> 1:16:42.181
OK, find the pattern,
find the pattern.

1:16:42.515 --> 1:16:45.268
OK, all on the same floor.

1:16:46.394 --> 1:16:49.606
Down one here. Yeah.

1:16:49.731 --> 1:16:52.191
Back up to the original floor. OK.

1:16:52.567 --> 1:16:53.860
So...

1:16:55.361 --> 1:17:01.200
Let's make the distance
between the dots uniform.

1:17:06.289 --> 1:17:08.291
What do you suppose it forms?

1:17:09.042 --> 1:17:11.711
It can't be another
astrological sign.

1:17:11.753 --> 1:17:13.129
So, what is it?

1:17:21.971 --> 1:17:23.931
Now, what is that?

1:17:24.891 --> 1:17:26.392
Music.

1:17:27.018 --> 1:17:28.353
Yeah.

1:17:35.151 --> 1:17:38.237
I feel like I'm waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

1:17:40.031 --> 1:17:42.200
It was a nifty theory.

1:17:45.328 --> 1:17:47.121
There's seven notes in a row.

1:17:47.205 --> 1:17:48.373
It goes...

1:17:53.586 --> 1:17:55.088
What's that?

1:17:56.297 --> 1:18:00.259
- No, I just made that up.
- There's seven notes in a row.

1:18:04.639 --> 1:18:07.058
No, no, no. Go back...

1:18:10.770 --> 1:18:12.271
But what is that?

1:18:15.316 --> 1:18:17.026
That, that, that, right there.

1:18:18.569 --> 1:18:20.113
Yes.

1:18:21.614 --> 1:18:24.283
What did you just?
Do it again.

1:18:28.913 --> 1:18:32.625
<i>I love,</i>
<i>I love my little Calendar girl</i>

1:18:43.636 --> 1:18:47.598
<i>I love,</i>
<i>I love my little Calendar girl</i>

1:18:47.849 --> 1:18:49.308
<i>Yeah</i>

1:18:50.184 --> 1:18:51.811
16th floor.

1:18:55.231 --> 1:18:57.316
We're lucky in that there's
only two single women

1:18:57.358 --> 1:19:00.153
living on the 16th floor
with windows facing this way,

1:19:00.236 --> 1:19:03.489
and one of them is currently
visiting Disney World.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:05.158
You're getting to be a real cop, Ed.

1:19:05.199 --> 1:19:06.325
Thank you.

1:19:24.385 --> 1:19:26.053
This is it.

1:19:28.681 --> 1:19:30.183
Keep going.

1:19:44.739 --> 1:19:46.616
We'll set up in here.

1:20:02.799 --> 1:20:04.383
All right.

1:20:06.552 --> 1:20:08.721
One of us always watches the door.

1:20:08.805 --> 1:20:10.556
We'll take 30-minute shifts.

1:20:11.349 --> 1:20:13.726
If it's the guy,
we just take note, let him go in.

1:20:13.810 --> 1:20:15.478
If it's the woman,
you know what to do.

1:20:16.771 --> 1:20:18.898
Bernadette,
you take the first watch.

1:20:23.528 --> 1:20:25.738
Ed, what's for dinner?

1:20:53.933 --> 1:20:55.226
Nothing edible?

1:21:35.474 --> 1:21:39.312
Prime number, Virgo
and <i>Calendar Girl?</i>

1:21:40.313 --> 1:21:42.773
I can say it now.

1:21:42.815 --> 1:21:45.026
I had my doubts.

1:21:47.486 --> 1:21:49.906
Why don't we just
take him now?

1:21:49.989 --> 1:21:52.658
No, no, no. Right now it's just
breaking and entering.

1:21:52.742 --> 1:21:54.827
We've got to surprise him

1:21:54.869 --> 1:21:58.205
in <i>flagrante homicido.</i>

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:48.881
Relax.

1:22:48.965 --> 1:22:50.049
Listen.

1:22:50.132 --> 1:22:51.926
We're with the police department.

1:22:52.009 --> 1:22:53.427
I am a police lieutenant.

1:22:54.178 --> 1:22:56.681
Lieutenant Starkey.
See?

1:22:56.722 --> 1:23:00.142
There is a man--
a killer, a strangler

1:23:00.226 --> 1:23:02.228
waiting right inside
your apartment door.

1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:05.439
If you'd gone through that door,
you'd be dead now.

1:23:05.523 --> 1:23:06.899
Understand?

1:23:08.401 --> 1:23:12.238
So we're gonna send
someone in, in your place,

1:23:12.321 --> 1:23:14.281
and we're gonna catch this man.

1:23:14.407 --> 1:23:15.783
Do you understand?

1:23:17.618 --> 1:23:19.870
Is that all right with you?

1:23:22.373 --> 1:23:24.041
All right.

1:23:25.334 --> 1:23:26.502
Thanks.

1:23:26.585 --> 1:23:27.795
Oh.

1:23:35.219 --> 1:23:37.388
All right.
You ready, Bernadette?

1:23:37.471 --> 1:23:38.806
Yeah.

1:23:40.975 --> 1:23:42.768
- You scared?
- Yeah.

1:23:43.352 --> 1:23:44.812
It's gonna be all right.

1:23:45.688 --> 1:23:47.106
Now, listen.

1:23:47.898 --> 1:23:49.525
You open the door.

1:23:50.151 --> 1:23:51.736
You close the door.

1:23:52.319 --> 1:23:54.196
You start to take off your coat.

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.615
As soon as you feel that ribbon,
you start screaming.

1:23:56.657 --> 1:23:58.701
It'll be a piece of cake.

1:23:59.201 --> 1:24:00.786
And what's the next
part again?

1:24:02.329 --> 1:24:03.497
I save you.

1:24:03.748 --> 1:24:05.750
Don't forget that part.

1:24:05.791 --> 1:24:07.126
Now, if I close the door behind me,

1:24:07.209 --> 1:24:08.419
how are you getting in?

1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:16.135
Sledgehammer.

1:24:18.345 --> 1:24:20.973
I thought you were supposed to
shoot the lock off with a gun.

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:22.475
I don't have a gun.

1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.893
You don't?

1:24:24.435 --> 1:24:25.895
Stop worrying.

1:24:26.687 --> 1:24:28.981
Ed, I think it'd be best if you
don't come in the apartment.

1:24:29.065 --> 1:24:31.317
You got it.
I'm an artist. I'll watch the woman.

1:24:34.153 --> 1:24:35.613
Let's go.

1:25:15.027 --> 1:25:16.028
Damn!

1:25:16.153 --> 1:25:17.530
Jesus!

1:25:19.865 --> 1:25:21.534
- Hang on!
- Yeah!

1:25:23.202 --> 1:25:24.703
Oh, Nick!

1:25:24.912 --> 1:25:26.080
Come on!

1:25:26.455 --> 1:25:27.873
I'm coming!

1:25:30.501 --> 1:25:31.877
Hang on!

1:25:31.961 --> 1:25:32.962
Nick!

1:25:36.924 --> 1:25:39.510
Oh, Nick!
Come on!

1:25:43.389 --> 1:25:44.765
Oh! Nick!

1:25:47.393 --> 1:25:48.644
God!

1:25:49.895 --> 1:25:51.814
- Bernadette!
- Hurry!

1:25:54.066 --> 1:25:56.777
Do your worst,
you dirty, murdering pig.

1:26:03.868 --> 1:26:05.286
You all right?

1:26:05.744 --> 1:26:06.912
I'm alive.

1:26:10.374 --> 1:26:12.751
My name is Lieutenant
Nicholas Starkey.

1:26:12.918 --> 1:26:15.129
You...are under arrest.

1:26:15.212 --> 1:26:16.881
You have the right
to remain silent--

1:26:26.432 --> 1:26:28.475
You really wanna play this out?

1:26:28.601 --> 1:26:31.478
I had a hard time finding you,
and I'm not about to let you go.

1:26:32.771 --> 1:26:35.024
- Call Alcoa!
- Yeah.

1:26:37.401 --> 1:26:40.404
You have the right to
legal counsel. You...

1:26:40.446 --> 1:26:41.697
Shit!

1:26:43.991 --> 1:26:45.826
Hi, get me
the, uh, second precinct

1:26:45.910 --> 1:26:47.286
please, it's an emergency.

1:27:05.846 --> 1:27:07.264
What?

1:27:10.309 --> 1:27:11.393
What?

1:27:14.396 --> 1:27:15.856
Hello, Mrs. Starkey.

1:27:15.940 --> 1:27:17.650
Hi. Lieutenant Starkey's
not in his office.

1:27:17.733 --> 1:27:19.777
I need to speak with him.
Do you know where he is?

1:27:19.818 --> 1:27:20.945
Well, I really
don't know where--

1:27:20.986 --> 1:27:22.738
Get backup.
Get the commissioner.

1:27:22.821 --> 1:27:25.282
Get three squad cars.
Tell them to get to this address.

1:27:25.324 --> 1:27:26.825
And tell them to get the fuck there!

1:27:26.909 --> 1:27:28.786
Nick's going at it
with the strangler.

1:27:28.827 --> 1:27:30.287
I thought the strangler was dead.

1:27:30.329 --> 1:27:34.708
So did I! And get me a car.
And get me the fuck there!

1:27:36.168 --> 1:27:38.295
Get the fuck out of my way!

1:27:41.131 --> 1:27:42.341
Sorry, ma'am.

1:27:42.508 --> 1:27:44.260
You'll have to excuse us.

1:27:44.343 --> 1:27:45.386
Of course.

1:27:48.555 --> 1:27:49.890
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:27:50.015 --> 1:27:52.309
- Hi. Where's my door?
- It's on the floor.

1:27:55.854 --> 1:27:57.398
Grab the elevator.

1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:14.748
How am I doing?

1:28:30.264 --> 1:28:31.724
Yah!

1:28:38.439 --> 1:28:40.774
Listen. Stop kicking me.
I hate that.

1:28:43.861 --> 1:28:45.821
I told you to stop that.
You're not getting away.

1:28:45.904 --> 1:28:47.406
Why don't you just fucking accept it?

1:28:56.206 --> 1:28:57.416
I hate this job.

1:29:02.671 --> 1:29:05.049
See? I told you to stop.

1:29:05.257 --> 1:29:06.425
But no!

1:29:06.759 --> 1:29:09.178
"All the force necessary,"
you know?

1:29:10.262 --> 1:29:12.389
Do you hear them?

1:29:20.272 --> 1:29:22.316
All right. That's it.

1:29:22.441 --> 1:29:27.112
You want the fight?
All right. Come on...

1:29:50.969 --> 1:29:52.763
You guys unload.

1:29:58.811 --> 1:30:01.397
- Let's go.
- Up there someplace.

1:30:01.772 --> 1:30:03.816
Boy, these fucking men.

1:30:04.108 --> 1:30:05.609
Popoli!

1:30:06.026 --> 1:30:07.653
What's going on?

1:30:08.404 --> 1:30:10.030
Nick's in there with the strangler.

1:30:11.865 --> 1:30:13.075
What about the guy we got?

1:30:13.158 --> 1:30:15.327
It came over the radio
on the way here.

1:30:15.369 --> 1:30:18.330
They just made the guy
we pegged for the strangler.

1:30:18.372 --> 1:30:20.999
He got out of the loony bin
about three days ago.

1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:23.585
He's been in there two years.

1:30:27.589 --> 1:30:28.590
Fuck!

1:30:36.181 --> 1:30:38.225
OK, are we rolling?

1:30:38.642 --> 1:30:40.185
Commissioner.

1:30:45.607 --> 1:30:47.484
Sorry, lady.
Police personnel only.

1:30:47.526 --> 1:30:48.986
Do you know who I am?

1:30:53.449 --> 1:30:55.492
Get down! Get down...

1:31:04.376 --> 1:31:05.586
Come on.

1:31:15.554 --> 1:31:18.140
Somebody call
an ambulance.

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:26.315
Wonder if I can get
a cup of coffee?

1:31:26.732 --> 1:31:28.901
Preferably espresso.

1:31:37.784 --> 1:31:39.369
Does anybody know this guy?

1:31:39.411 --> 1:31:41.705
Who he is ain't important.

1:31:41.955 --> 1:31:43.248
That was the problem with him.

1:31:44.041 --> 1:31:45.334
He's nobody.

1:32:05.229 --> 1:32:06.355
Get the photog out of here.

1:32:06.438 --> 1:32:07.606
Let's go, come on!

1:32:08.941 --> 1:32:10.275
Hi.

1:32:12.027 --> 1:32:13.737
What are you doing here?

1:32:16.448 --> 1:32:17.991
I left Frank.

1:32:21.119 --> 1:32:22.621
You'll never change.

1:32:23.205 --> 1:32:24.665
Go away.

1:32:26.875 --> 1:32:28.085
You love me.

1:32:28.961 --> 1:32:30.462
No, Christine.

1:32:31.421 --> 1:32:33.757
I loved an idea I had
that looked like you.

1:32:37.261 --> 1:32:38.303
Nick.

1:32:44.977 --> 1:32:46.687
Here's the check.

1:32:51.650 --> 1:32:53.360
Darling...

1:32:53.443 --> 1:32:55.904
don't say I never gave you anything.

1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:06.707
Good luck, Bernadette.

1:33:09.668 --> 1:33:12.212
The world's either great
or wretched, isn't it?

1:33:12.296 --> 1:33:14.673
So many people are just finished.

1:33:15.757 --> 1:33:17.426
You think, huh?

1:33:18.802 --> 1:33:20.345
I don't know, really.

1:33:21.346 --> 1:33:24.016
All I know is,
I'm going home.

1:33:24.057 --> 1:33:25.434
I quit.

1:33:25.809 --> 1:33:27.728
- The job?
- Yes.

1:33:27.811 --> 1:33:29.688
I'm going home.
I'm gonna mix some paint.

1:33:29.730 --> 1:33:32.107
And I'm gonna try
and do something original.

1:33:32.190 --> 1:33:33.400
See you.

1:33:36.403 --> 1:33:37.863
Listen.

1:33:38.530 --> 1:33:40.032
I want to make you dinner.

1:33:41.491 --> 1:33:43.493
You know, in a couple of days.

1:33:44.786 --> 1:33:45.871
Yeah?

1:33:45.954 --> 1:33:48.373
OK.
That would be nice.

1:33:49.082 --> 1:33:50.834
I want to make you haggis.

1:33:51.710 --> 1:33:54.087
What's haggis?

1:33:54.254 --> 1:33:56.423
It's a Scottish dish.

1:33:56.715 --> 1:33:59.051
You take the stomach of a sheep...

1:33:59.134 --> 1:34:01.845
and then you stuff it
with the sheep's lungs, liver,

1:34:01.887 --> 1:34:05.182
and heart, some onions,
suet and oatmeal.

1:34:05.223 --> 1:34:06.892
And then you boil the whole thing.

1:34:07.934 --> 1:34:09.561
Well, I don't know.

1:34:11.063 --> 1:34:12.981
Sounds a little weird.

1:34:14.399 --> 1:34:15.817
But I'm game to try it.
