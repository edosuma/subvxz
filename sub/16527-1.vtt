18:50.405 --> 18:51.740
MURTAUGH:
Yeah. LAPD.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.844
We're here to inform you
that one of your co‐workers,

18:53.844 --> 18:56.650
Mr. Ramon Alvarez,
just passed away.

18:56.650 --> 18:58.821
He was a rent‐a‐cop,
not a co‐worker.

18:58.821 --> 19:02.027
But I heard he had
a young son.

19:02.027 --> 19:03.431
It's a tragedy.

19:05.335 --> 19:07.104
What about him?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.441
He a co‐worker?

19:10.110 --> 19:12.147
He's an employee.

19:12.147 --> 19:14.118
Why?
I dig his ink.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.788
Recognize it from Texas.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.824
Real big in the Juarez
drug dealer set.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.128
You know, maybe
I should go say hi.
Go say hi.

19:19.128 --> 19:20.798
I'm gonna go talk to him. Maybe
we know some of the same people.

19:20.798 --> 19:22.636
Hey, I haven't given
police permission to question

19:22.636 --> 19:24.473
my employees.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, chico.

19:24.473 --> 19:26.644
You don't want us coming
back here with warrants

19:26.644 --> 19:28.179

all your cargo.

19:29.316 --> 19:30.418
Hey!

19:31.820 --> 19:32.856

19:32.856 --> 19:35.395
Look, I want to talk to you
about Ramon Alvarez.

19:35.395 --> 19:37.231
Hey, look, I know
you didn't kill him;

19:37.231 --> 19:38.634
if you did, he wouldn't
have a head, right?

19:39.603 --> 19:41.573

19:50.558 --> 19:52.061

19:53.196 --> 19:54.533
Nothing?

19:54.533 --> 19:55.768
Look, I don't have a badge

19:55.768 --> 19:57.271
or a gun or anything, you know.

19:57.271 --> 19:58.374
Had disciplinary issues.

19:58.374 --> 20:00.143

did this guy do?

Mm‐hmm.

23:33.937 --> 23:35.508
Tell him, tell him
what the ta...

23:35.508 --> 23:36.443
Uh, he had a...

23:36.443 --> 23:37.979
a skull tattoo on
the side of his neck,

23:37.979 --> 23:39.716
which I associated with
a cartel in Juarez.

23:39.716 --> 23:41.051
Right, so he questioned him.

23:41.051 --> 23:42.388
I did.
And the guy fled,

23:42.388 --> 23:43.957
so we pursued
at a safe distance.

23:43.957 --> 23:44.959
Because we...
And then he pulled a gun!

23:44.959 --> 23:45.861
Yeah, he pulled a gun.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.473

23:51.473 --> 23:53.042
That's where
Ramon Alvarez worked.

23:53.042 --> 23:54.913
The DOA from the bluff.
I thought that was a suicide.

23:54.913 --> 23:56.783
Yeah, but he had silt
on his shoe.
Exac...

23:56.783 --> 23:58.754
And... right and he was a SEAL.
And he tried to shoot himself
with his non‐dominant hand...

23:58.754 --> 24:00.190
(talking over each other)

24:00.190 --> 24:01.560
Stop!

24:01.560 --> 24:02.695
Enough!

24:02.695 --> 24:03.864
Dirt on his shoe,

24:03.864 --> 24:05.868
non‐dominant hand
and Arizona?

24:05.868 --> 24:07.438
That's what we have?

24:07.438 --> 24:09.542
Well, when you say it
like that, it doesn't...

24:09.542 --> 24:11.546
Fair enough.
I'll put someone else on this.

24:11.546 --> 24:13.717
Per your request Murtaugh,
starting tomorrow,

24:13.717 --> 24:14.986
both of you are reassigned.

27:02.086 --> 27:04.592
You sure you don't
want a cop for that?

27:04.592 --> 27:07.865
Look, maybe I was a little
out of line before.

27:07.865 --> 27:09.602
All right, I get it.

27:09.602 --> 27:10.671
You're too old for...

27:10.671 --> 27:12.140
Hey, hey, hey, no.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.747
I'm just as sharp
as I've always been.

27:15.747 --> 27:17.050
TRISH:
Baby, who is it?

27:17.050 --> 27:18.787
Uh, it's no... noth... no one.

27:18.787 --> 27:19.789
Just, um...

27:19.789 --> 27:21.593
Hi. Martin Riggs.

27:21.593 --> 27:22.895
The guy that almost
got your husband killed.

27:22.895 --> 27:24.064
I'm sure you've heard
a lot about me.

27:24.064 --> 27:25.634
Not a word.
We're about to have dinner.

27:25.634 --> 27:26.970
Would you like to come in,
Martin Riggs?

27:26.970 --> 27:27.972
No, he can't.

27:27.972 --> 27:29.140
He can't...
Yeah, and I ate,

27:29.140 --> 27:31.144
like, a week ago,
so, you know, I'm fine.
TRISH: Oh.

27:31.144 --> 27:32.848
I mean,
it smells great, but...
(laughing): Oh.

27:32.848 --> 27:35.086
Tastes even better.
Oh, okay.

27:48.278 --> 27:50.116
My dad says you
were in a war.

27:50.116 --> 27:51.819
See any action?

27:51.819 --> 27:52.988
(groans)
Such a nerd.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.694
Yeah, a little.

27:55.694 --> 27:57.096
You know, I'm thinking
about enlisting, too.

27:57.096 --> 27:58.400
No, you're not.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.136
ROGER JR.:
I want real‐life experience.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.004
What am I gonna learn
at Princeton

28:01.004 --> 28:01.939
that I couldn't
learn from the Internet?

28:01.939 --> 28:04.144
What it feels like
to touch a live girl?

28:04.144 --> 28:06.716
(laughs)

28:06.716 --> 28:08.052
I think you should enlist.

28:08.052 --> 28:09.622
Hell, I think there
should be a draft.

28:09.622 --> 28:11.325
But I suppose

28:11.325 --> 28:13.162
it all depends on the life
experience you're after.

28:13.162 --> 28:15.333
If you want to see your best
friend's head get blown off,

28:15.333 --> 28:16.469
it's ideal.

28:16.469 --> 28:18.339
But if you're just trying
to piss off your parents?

28:18.339 --> 28:21.111
Hitchhiking through Thailand,
that be a little bit better.

28:21.111 --> 28:23.683
See, Mom, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

28:23.683 --> 28:25.654
No, stop, we're not talking
about that right...
Experience.

28:25.654 --> 28:26.656
Why?

28:26.656 --> 28:28.393
What's going on?

28:28.393 --> 28:29.962
I don't like being
out of the loop.

28:29.962 --> 28:30.964
What's happening?

28:30.964 --> 28:33.403
I had a teeny bit of weed.

28:33.403 --> 28:35.206
What?!
And now Mom is losing her sh...

28:35.206 --> 28:36.208
No... watch it.
stuff.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.176
Watch it.
Losing her stuff.

28:37.176 --> 28:37.978
I'm really impressed
with the weed out here.

28:37.978 --> 28:40.216
I mean, it's incredible,
you know?

28:40.216 --> 28:41.986
I mean, as far as I can tell,
it's really the only perk

28:41.986 --> 28:44.592
to living in
California.

28:49.802 --> 28:52.708
I had massive, you know,
psychological issues.

28:52.708 --> 28:55.347
So, of course, I would never,
uh, suggest that for a child.

28:55.347 --> 28:56.883
What I would suggest, though,

28:56.883 --> 28:58.419
maybe your old man
take a little hit off the tree.

28:58.419 --> 29:00.724
You know what I mean? Little
bald‐headed Coolio gets loose.

29:00.724 --> 29:02.394
(laughter)

29:02.394 --> 29:03.763
That's funny, huh?

29:03.763 --> 29:04.965
I like being tight.

29:04.965 --> 29:06.067
It keeps me alive.

29:06.067 --> 29:08.071
Well, we can tell. Yeah.

29:08.071 --> 29:11.077
So, Martin...
do you have any kids?

29:14.284 --> 29:15.787
Uh... no.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.357
Um...

29:17.357 --> 29:18.960
wasn't really in the cards.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.664
Mm. But you're married?
You know?

29:24.003 --> 29:25.874
Not anymore.

29:25.874 --> 29:27.143
Not anymore, no.

29:27.143 --> 29:29.113
MURTAUGH:
Imagine that.

29:29.113 --> 29:30.984
Let me guess.

29:30.984 --> 29:33.121
You had an affair with your gun.
(laughs)

29:33.121 --> 29:35.259
Nobody's laughing.

29:37.798 --> 29:39.768
She passed away.

29:45.179 --> 29:47.149
I'm sorry, Martin.

29:47.149 --> 29:49.922
Ah, it's life,

29:49.922 --> 29:52.327
Never ceases
to surprise.

29:54.932 --> 29:56.469
(baby crying)

29:56.469 --> 29:58.171
It's the baby.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.744

30:17.243 --> 30:20.282
Nice family you got.

30:20.282 --> 30:23.021
Yeah, they keep us
on our toes.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.425
And up all night.

30:24.425 --> 30:26.929
Yeah, I noticed the slight...

30:26.929 --> 30:28.800
The slight
age difference, yeah.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.237
What do you want?
It wasn't part of the plan.

30:31.237 --> 30:32.541
Trish was 42.

30:32.541 --> 30:33.376
The kids were out.

30:33.376 --> 30:35.212
Nine months later,
this one comes out.

30:35.212 --> 30:38.085
She come...
Boom, I'm here!

30:38.085 --> 30:40.557
You can't deny me!

30:40.557 --> 30:41.826
(laughs)

30:43.496 --> 30:46.134
And then I have a heart attack
in the delivery room.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.406
You were in the right place.

30:48.406 --> 30:50.443
Anywhere else, they say
I wouldn't have made it.

30:50.443 --> 30:51.879
Dada!

30:51.879 --> 30:54.518
Dada, dada!
Yeah.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.289
I'm sorry about your wife.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.160
I didn't know.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.330
I know.

31:00.330 --> 31:01.499
I just wanted
to embarrass you a little.

31:01.499 --> 31:03.101
Yeah, well,
for the future,

31:03.101 --> 31:05.139
I do a pretty good job
of that myself.

31:05.139 --> 31:06.442
Ain't that right,
baby?

31:06.442 --> 31:08.379
Hmm, ain't
that right, baby?

31:08.379 --> 31:10.483
She was a good one.

31:13.556 --> 31:16.429
Gave me something
to live for, you know?

31:21.171 --> 31:22.340
Hey.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.342
You ever hold one
of these before?

31:23.342 --> 31:25.312
Oh, no, I haven't washed
my hands in a long time.

31:25.312 --> 31:27.951
I'll be right back.

31:27.951 --> 31:29.253
Where you going?

31:29.253 --> 31:31.592
To get my keys.

31:31.592 --> 31:33.463
The case isn't being
reassigned till tomorrow.

31:33.463 --> 31:36.802
That means we got tonight
to solve it.

31:52.367 --> 31:54.070
You find anything
unusual?

31:54.070 --> 31:55.239
A few things.

31:55.239 --> 31:57.209
See that?
Notes of stippling,

31:57.209 --> 31:59.581
or gunpowder around the entry
wound suggests the gun

31:59.581 --> 32:01.385
wasn't directly against
his head when it was fired.

32:01.385 --> 32:02.888
Have you ever seen
a suicide like that?

32:02.888 --> 32:03.956
Nope.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.259
Also the tox reports
say he had

32:05.259 --> 32:07.062
40 milligrams of Klonopin
in his system.

32:07.062 --> 32:08.933
Enough to kill him if the bullet
didn't get there first.

32:08.933 --> 32:11.539
Didn't his wife say
he was off of that drug?

32:11.539 --> 32:13.643
So someone had to know
the meds he was on,

32:13.643 --> 32:15.346
so it didn't look
like he'd been doped.

32:15.346 --> 32:16.214
I'll check his medical records.

32:16.214 --> 32:17.984
All right, I'm gonna
go talk to his wife.

Yeah?

Daryl Hennicky.

Alvarez's boss from the port.

Hennicky had to know
they were smuggling drugs
down at the port.

35:28.231 --> 35:31.103
So he hires Alvarez
and then he convinces him

35:31.103 --> 35:33.274

So Hennicky kills Alvarez...

You're a good man, Roger.

36:44.216 --> 36:45.619
And a good cop.

36:46.922 --> 36:49.226
You take care of that family
of yours, okay?

36:56.307 --> 36:58.378
(footsteps)

36:58.378 --> 37:00.483
(Riggs whistling)

37:07.330 --> 37:09.133
(guns clicking)
(door closes)

37:11.237 --> 37:13.475
Could I help you, officer?

37:15.412 --> 37:16.581
Yeah, I'm here for the kid.

37:16.581 --> 37:18.485
What kid?

37:18.485 --> 37:19.821
Ramon Alvarez's son.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.493
Unless you got other
kidnapped children here,

37:22.493 --> 37:24.364
in which case,
I'll take them as well.

37:24.364 --> 37:25.900
Look, I get it.
You took the kid

37:25.900 --> 37:28.204
because you thought
that his dad stole your heroin,

37:28.204 --> 37:29.139
which he did.

37:29.139 --> 37:30.476
Which, I could care less
about all of this.

37:30.476 --> 37:32.346
My only concern
is the 12‐year‐old boy.

37:32.346 --> 37:35.319
So if you let me walk
out of here with him,

37:35.319 --> 37:37.657
none of this
ever happened.

37:38.792 --> 37:41.163
Or we can explore
option number two.

37:43.502 --> 37:44.504
Which is?

37:44.504 --> 37:46.240
Ooh. Well, that's the one where

37:46.240 --> 37:48.412
I kill as many of you as I can
before you take me out

37:48.412 --> 37:49.681
and then you
up your profile

37:49.681 --> 37:50.983
from small‐time dealer
to cop killer.

37:50.983 --> 37:52.587
Then you spend the rest
of your life in prison

37:52.587 --> 37:53.789
or on the run‐‐
most likely, dead.

37:53.789 --> 37:56.227
I'm not saying
that it's a great option,

37:56.227 --> 37:57.430
but people like choices.

37:57.430 --> 37:59.299
(laughs)

37:59.299 --> 38:00.301
(laughs)

38:00.301 --> 38:01.338
Yeah?

38:04.844 --> 38:06.615
Why don't you put
your weapon down

38:06.615 --> 38:09.487
and then I'll
show you the kid.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.799
God, I love this weapon.

38:15.799 --> 38:17.269
(clicks)

38:17.269 --> 38:18.505
All right.

38:25.251 --> 38:27.823
Your turn.

38:30.696 --> 38:32.633
Hey, buddy.

38:34.337 --> 38:35.539
You okay?

38:35.539 --> 38:37.275
Yeah.

38:37.275 --> 38:38.912
All right.

38:38.912 --> 38:41.250
We're gonna get you home, okay?
Hold it.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.022
If you know where my product is,

38:44.022 --> 38:45.592
go get it right now.

38:46.494 --> 38:47.797

What are you doing here?

39:23.335 --> 39:25.806
Came to get these cuffs off me.

39:31.016 --> 39:33.020
Put that BOLO out on Hennicky.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.759
How am I supposed
to explain all of this?

39:35.759 --> 39:36.828
(both laughing)

39:36.828 --> 39:38.732
You could call it in anonymously
and we could run.

39:38.732 --> 39:39.734
Yeah, right.

the BOLO on Hennicky.

39:46.414 --> 39:47.650

39:48.652 --> 39:50.722

have one shot.

40:01.377 --> 40:02.546
(both panting)

40:02.546 --> 40:03.815
Okay.

40:03.815 --> 40:05.519
Here's what we're gonna do.

40:05.519 --> 40:06.921
I'm gonna get up;

40:06.921 --> 40:08.023
he's gonna shoot me.

40:08.023 --> 40:09.861
Okay? But he's gonna
give up his position

40:09.861 --> 40:11.598
and then you
shoot him.

40:11.598 --> 40:12.600
Okay?
Wait.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.604
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you insane?

40:14.604 --> 40:15.839

40:16.741 --> 40:18.445
Yeah.
