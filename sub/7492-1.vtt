WEBVTT

00:05.875 --> 00:09.959
And now it's time for my favorite part
of your dining experience.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.208
The check!

00:13.625 --> 00:15.792
Guys, relax. I'm paying today.

00:15.875 --> 00:19.083
My new job at the dojo means
I can treat my friends to a nice meal.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.250
You guys want dessert?

00:20.291 --> 00:23.041
Oh, I'm good.
Dessert at Phil's is disgusting.

00:23.125 --> 00:26.208
It's just a scoop of hummus
drizzled with sweet mold.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.709
Forget dessert. I wanna go work out.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.083
Whoa.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.083
That's a little bit more than I expected.

00:32.166 --> 00:35.208
Um, we didn't order five
baba ghanoush platters.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.917
Oh. No, I did.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.333
Yeah, I heard you were buying.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.458
Thanks, Jack.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.792
Put on your fancy hairnet, Tootsie!

00:45.333 --> 00:46.917
Uh, you have to leave.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.500
- You, leave!

00:49.583 --> 00:51.417
- You can stay.
- Phil, what are you doing?

00:51.500 --> 00:53.917
The Prince of Hachmachistan
is coming here to see me,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.709
and I don't want him looking at anyone
who's not pleasing to the eyes.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.709
And, uh, I'll be honest
with you, Milton...

00:58.792 --> 01:01.166
You, my friend, very much on the fence.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.417
Why is the Prince of Hachmachistan
in Seaford?

01:04.500 --> 01:06.291
Hachmachistan is gonna use
the port of Seaford

01:06.375 --> 01:08.291
for all of its American trading.

01:08.375 --> 01:11.542
There's gonna be a royal reception
tomorrow night at the Seaford Tower.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.375
And I'll be attending. You know why?

01:13.709 --> 01:15.792
Because you're a nerd with no life.

01:16.625 --> 01:17.917
And...

01:19.542 --> 01:22.291
I'm president of
the Student United Nations Club.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.083
He's here! He's here!

01:26.875 --> 01:29.709
<i>Welcome, welcome, Your Highness.</i>

01:29.792 --> 01:31.166
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:35.000
If the redheaded bird boy offends you,
he's out.

01:36.583 --> 01:39.291
My name is Yuval, Prince of Hachmachistan.

01:39.417 --> 01:42.583
When a man from my country
sees a beautiful woman,

01:42.667 --> 01:45.083
there is a customary greeting. May I?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.125
'Kay.

01:52.875 --> 01:54.291
Um, you're good, handsome.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.583
Hey, uh, Jack.
Can we help you with our check?

01:58.667 --> 02:00.250
Relax, I got it.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.667
No, I got it.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.417
Put your little pennies away.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.458
I would like the honor of treating
this lovely lady and her friends.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.709
Excuse me.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.500
Uvula, is it?

02:12.583 --> 02:14.875
Yeah, thanks, but I'm paying that.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.041
Can you believe this guy?
I pay my own checks.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.291
Too late! It is paid.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.417
Oh, I'm sorry, would anyone care
for some dessert?

02:21.500 --> 02:23.166
I could go for some dessert.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.166
You literally just said
you wanted to work out.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.208
Well, now I want dessert, Jack.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.166
Fine.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.000
And when the Prince said goodbye,

03:16.083 --> 03:20.667
he leaned in close and looked at me
with those big beautiful cow eyes and...

03:21.000 --> 03:22.750
You wanna know what I said to him?

03:22.834 --> 03:23.875
Moo?

03:25.333 --> 03:27.250
No, Jack. I didn't say m...

03:27.792 --> 03:30.625
Wait, I was thinking about cows.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.709
What if... Oh, no, I probably did.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.834
Way to go, Kim. A Prince comes to town
and you moo him.

03:35.750 --> 03:36.750
Get over it, Kim.

03:36.834 --> 03:39.083
He's just obnoxious pretty boy royalty.

03:40.709 --> 03:42.542
Don't bite me.
- What is that thing?

03:42.625 --> 03:44.500
It's a lemur from Madagascar.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.500
Yeah, part of my job at
the Seaford Animal Park

03:46.583 --> 03:47.667
is taking care of it.

03:47.750 --> 03:51.125
It sleeps all day and spends its nights
in a treetop licking itself.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.875
Lucky!

03:53.917 --> 03:56.542
Yeah, there's a chance it might be
carrying Madagascar Madness,

03:56.625 --> 03:58.417
so I'm keeping him
quarantined for the week.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.125
Big news, people! Big news!

04:01.208 --> 04:03.959
I have been asked by the Prince
to present him with the symbolic key

04:04.041 --> 04:06.959
to the city of Seaford
at his royal reception tomorrow night.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.750
Congrats, Phil.

04:08.834 --> 04:12.000
- But what's with the roses?
- These are for the Kims.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.041
He also wanted you to have this.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.875
Diamonds? Oh, I can't believe this.
No boy's ever given me a necklace before.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.583
Excuse me. Uh, I gave you one.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.000
Oh, that's right.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.709
The one you made me at summer camp
made out of macaroni.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.000
It was rigatoni.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.834
Learn your pasta, woman.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.959
Jack, you're just jealous
because you weren't invited.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.917
Please, there's not a guy in the world

04:41.000 --> 04:43.375
that would wanna go
to some fancy ball for a Prince.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.458
I wanna go! I wanna go! I wanna go!

04:46.542 --> 04:49.917
Sorry, Rudy. Nobody gets in
without an invitation.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.208
Although, if you are willing to pose
as my manservant...

04:53.291 --> 04:56.208
Ah, excuse me,
I am a third-degree black belt

04:56.291 --> 04:57.500
and a respected sensei.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.625
- There is no way that--
- All-you-can-eat cheese balls.

04:59.709 --> 05:01.417
Pick you up at eight, my liege.

05:08.583 --> 05:12.125
You two gotta check out this video
of Joan the security guard I put online.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.583
<i>Base, I'm involved
in a high-speed chase.</i>

05:14.875 --> 05:17.083
<i>Pull it...</i>

05:17.875 --> 05:19.125
Over!

05:21.125 --> 05:22.875
Okay. Wow!

05:23.583 --> 05:26.333
Got ourselves a comedian here.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.709
Well, hardy har har.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.667
How about this for a laugh?

05:30.750 --> 05:32.917
You, sir, are in...

05:33.709 --> 05:35.625
Bad move, perp.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.875
You just woke up the jackrabbit, huh?

05:38.959 --> 05:41.750
Oh! Oh! Oh, pulled a hammy!

05:41.834 --> 05:42.875
Pulled a hammy!

05:44.792 --> 05:47.166
Oh, it still cracks me up.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.041
Yeah, that thing is... not funny at all!

05:52.458 --> 05:55.875
My boss saw that video,
and now I'm suspended

05:55.959 --> 05:58.917
unless I pass the mall cop fitness test.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.750
Yeah, when I took this job, I didn't know
I had to be something called "in shape".

06:04.125 --> 06:07.041
You know what, Joan?
I'm gonna help you pass that test.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.125
Yeah. You are.

06:10.208 --> 06:12.583
You know, this job means everything to me.

06:12.667 --> 06:16.458
If you... you take away my keys, my badge,
my uniform, you know what's left?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.542
A crazy naked lady in boots.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.834
Bingo.

06:26.291 --> 06:27.291
You can do this, Joan.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.291
- I can't.
You're so close! Come on.

06:31.834 --> 06:32.792
Aah!

06:35.834 --> 06:37.291
Whoo-whee!

06:37.375 --> 06:39.375
Tying your shoe can be a workout.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.917
-
- Oh. Oh, it's time to feed my lemur.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.166
Yeah, then we can start training.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.792
Be right back. Gotta grab his food.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.333
- Huh, I've never seen a lemur before.
-

06:53.333 --> 06:56.333
Oh. Look, you're kinda cute.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.083
Oh, getting a little hissy, missy, huh?

07:08.083 --> 07:10.291
Why, you little...

07:10.417 --> 07:13.083
-
- Whoa! Oh!

07:15.375 --> 07:18.000
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.458
Way to work out, Joan! No pain, no gain!

07:20.542 --> 07:23.709
A lot of pain! A lot of pain!
- Whoa! Jeez!

07:32.250 --> 07:34.083
Oh, Joan, this is bad.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.000
- He bit you.
- Oh.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.333
He's being quarantined because they think
he might be carrying Madagascar Madness.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.583
Oh.

07:40.667 --> 07:43.417
I'd be more worried
about the lemur, Jerry.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.834
I was once bit by a kangaroo
at a petting zoo,

07:45.917 --> 07:48.917
and he started twitching
and crawled into his own pouch.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.709
Poor fella sneezed
and turned himself inside out.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.083
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

08:19.709 --> 08:21.834
What are you doing in here?
This place is closed.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Really? A tranquilizer dart?

08:45.542 --> 08:48.166
The silent alarm went off, Jack.
What's going on?

08:48.250 --> 08:49.375
I caught this guy breaking in.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.500
He tried to shoot me
with a tranquilizer dart.

08:51.583 --> 08:52.959
We'll take it from here.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.375
Good afternoon, Agent 34.

09:13.458 --> 09:17.208
The Prince of Hachmachistan
is in grave danger from this man.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.875
Phil?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.083
Phil's a falafel maker.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

09:21.166 --> 09:25.291
For several years, he's been posing as
a falafel maker who wouldn't hurt a fly.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.000
He's actually a dangerous hit man.

09:29.083 --> 09:33.417
Yesterday, our surveillance team took
this photo of him buying a toxic vapor.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.583
If this vapor is released
tonight at the royal reception,

09:36.667 --> 09:38.625
the Prince and everyone attending,

09:38.709 --> 09:40.583
will be eliminated.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.125
This just doesn't make any sense.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.542
I don't know what's sparkling more,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.542
the diamonds or your eyes.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.750
You care for some punch?

09:58.125 --> 10:01.750
Uh, no! I mean... I mean, yes, yes.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.083
I mean...

10:03.500 --> 10:04.792
Moo?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.667
<i>I look ridiculous!</i>

10:10.750 --> 10:12.917
<i>You look like traditional
Hachmachi manservant.</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:14.875
<i>Now get out there and introduce me!</i>

10:22.667 --> 10:27.542
Now presenting the Grand High Exalted
Mystic Falafel Maker,

10:30.125 --> 10:32.083
and all-around super guy...

10:32.875 --> 10:33.875
Phil.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.375
That's right! Phil is in the house!

10:37.458 --> 10:39.667
What is up, Iceland? Looking chill, baby.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.792
Brrr.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.542
Oh, this is great. Just great!
My friends are in danger,

10:46.625 --> 10:49.250
and I take out the one government agent
who was sent to help them.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.291
That is so Jack!

10:52.834 --> 10:55.875
The royal reception is being held
at the Seaford Tower.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.208
Due to heightened security,

10:57.291 --> 11:01.458
the only viable point of access
is an air vent located on the 86th floor.

11:01.542 --> 11:04.792
This air vent will grant you access
to the air duct system.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.625
Yeah, no problem getting up there.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.917
All I need is a pair
of super high-tech sticky gloves.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
You've been issued a pair
of super high-tech sticky gloves.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.583
Everything else you need
to carry out this mission safely

11:17.667 --> 11:19.625
is located in the backpack.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.542
Good luck, Agent 34.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.083
I can do this.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.333
Nope, I can't do this.

11:52.208 --> 11:54.625
Joan, I don't think
you can take this test tonight.

11:54.709 --> 11:57.291
You might have a touch
of the Madagascar Madness.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.250
What makes you say that? I feel fine.

12:01.083 --> 12:04.583
- I should probably call a doctor.
- Oh, you're not calling anyone!

12:04.667 --> 12:06.917
I've never felt so alive!

12:16.667 --> 12:18.208
Whoo!

12:18.291 --> 12:20.291
Yeah, I'd say you're
ready for the test, Joan.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.333
Ah, I feel...

12:21.417 --> 12:23.333
...good!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.125
Would you listen to that.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.041
My friend Donna just caught a rabbit.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.500
Finally, the 86th floor.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.125
Oh, no. Oh, this can't be good.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:55.125 --> 12:56.750
Whoa! Whoa!

13:03.959 --> 13:06.375
Self-launching grappling hook.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.542
Yes!

13:15.667 --> 13:16.750
Huh.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.709
<i>I wonder what this one does.</i>

13:18.792 --> 13:21.250
Whoa!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.667
Vent... my way in.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.125
All right, let's do this.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.333
Joan Malone is ready for her test.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.250
All right. Go on my whistle.

13:59.959 --> 14:03.250
-
- Joan. Joan. Joan, listen.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.959
You see that guy over there
with the stopwatch?

14:06.291 --> 14:09.417
He's the only thing standing
between you and getting your job back.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.208
-
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.291
- You know what to do, right?
-

14:15.375 --> 14:16.959
Ready? Perfect.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.875
Okay, Mr. Richards. She's ready.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.333
Joan, no! Bad girl!

14:31.959 --> 14:35.583
And to think, such a small man like me

14:36.333 --> 14:39.375
is giving my prince such a big key.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.291
No, no. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.291
Oh, yes! Crying is definitely
the way to go. Nice!

14:54.417 --> 14:55.875
You remind me of someone.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.208
Are you the Brad Pitts?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.417
No, no, no!

15:05.500 --> 15:06.959
- Oh!
-

15:16.166 --> 15:20.458
And to think, a small man like me

15:21.041 --> 15:22.500
is...

15:22.583 --> 15:25.917
A small man like me is giving my prince

15:26.000 --> 15:28.250
such a big, big key.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.709
Ugh. Man, this guy is ugly.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.542
But Joan, you got the shots.
The madness is over.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.542
And so is my career.

15:50.959 --> 15:53.000
Might as well go face the music.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.542
- Mr. Richards.
- What happened to me?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.625
All I remember is being attacked
by some beast.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.375
Mr. Richards, there's something
that I need to tell you.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.709
I was the one who--

16:10.792 --> 16:12.291
Saved your life.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.875
- What?
- Yeah.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.291
Yeah, that's right.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.291
Everybody ran in fear. But not Joan.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.583
Mm-mm.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.875
You saved me?

16:21.750 --> 16:23.083
Uh...

16:24.291 --> 16:26.083
I did.

16:26.166 --> 16:29.041
I did what the boy said.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.875
I don't know how I'll ever thank you.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.333
You're exactly the kind of guard we need.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.291
You'll have a job here
as long as you want one.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.750
Oh, wait a minute. Huh!

16:41.834 --> 16:44.834
What makes you think
that I still want a job here?

16:44.917 --> 16:45.959
Huh?

16:46.041 --> 16:48.458
Someone like me could get
a job anywhere. I mean, it--

16:53.959 --> 16:55.291
Is that my hair?

16:56.291 --> 16:57.458
See you Monday!

17:05.709 --> 17:07.667
One too many shrimp puffs?

17:07.750 --> 17:09.291
Been there, brother.

17:21.375 --> 17:24.166
All right, Phil, you've got one chance
to tell me what's going on.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.291
I don't know.

17:25.375 --> 17:28.291
I was attacked by a man wearing a mask
that looked just like me.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.583
What... A mask?

17:31.834 --> 17:35.750
He was so handsome, Jack,
I cried a little each time I struck him.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.208
Well, that's it.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.542
The hit man must be a master of disguise.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.917
He's using your face
to get close to the Prince.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.959
He's ruining my big night.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.542
After the Prince signs
the trade agreement,

17:48.625 --> 17:50.625
I'm supposed to present him
with this big key.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.667
I should be up there right now.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.792
It just doesn't make any sense.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.291
Unless...

17:58.709 --> 18:01.208
The toxic vapor is in a duplicate key.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.417
He must be using a duplicate key!

18:04.250 --> 18:06.208
Hey! Oh! Jack?

18:06.291 --> 18:07.917
Jack, you dropped one of your gloves.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.166
Jack?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.542
Ooh.

18:14.625 --> 18:15.750
Fancy!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.458
Presenting the key to the city,

18:25.542 --> 18:29.000
Hachmachistan's own Falafel Phil.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.834
Hey, waiter with the cheese balls,
I've been looking for you.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.125
- Wait, stop!
- Jack?

18:47.041 --> 18:48.250
- Throw it!
- What?

18:48.333 --> 18:50.000
The key! Throw it out the window, now!

19:17.000 --> 19:18.959
Jack, what are you doing to Phil?

19:19.041 --> 19:20.125
He's not Phil.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.250
Who are you?

19:21.333 --> 19:22.375
Brewer.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.875
Jack Brewer.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.750
And I would have gotten away with it,
if it wasn't for those meddling kids!

19:39.959 --> 19:41.834
Jack, how did you...
I mean, why did you...

19:41.917 --> 19:43.166
What was the...

19:43.250 --> 19:44.458
Look...

19:45.041 --> 19:46.291
I'll explain the whole thing later.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.083
Kim! Kim!

19:48.166 --> 19:51.959
You and this boy
with the amazing hair saved my life.

19:52.166 --> 19:55.291
I have never met a girl like you.
You must be my princess.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.417
You will come to my country--

19:56.500 --> 19:58.166
Not gonna happen, hon.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.750
I mean, look, you're a nice guy,
but, uh...

20:00.834 --> 20:03.709
honestly, I don't think I'm cut out
for this whole royalty thing.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.834
I owe you my sincere appreciation.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.125
I hope you know
you are a very wealthy man.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.458
Oh, I do.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.959
Oh, which reminds me.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.000
Here's 39.50
from the bill at Falafel Phil's.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.041
When I say
I'm treating my friends to lunch,

20:22.125 --> 20:23.625
I treat my friends to lunch.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.125
I'm still short about four bucks,
but I figured I saved your life.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.959
- So we're even, right?
-

20:29.041 --> 20:31.625
Not so much. Mail it to the palace.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.959
Look, Jack, every girl likes getting
attention from a handsome Prince.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.208
But, uh, I just want you to know that

20:39.291 --> 20:42.291
I feel a lot more comfortable around you
than I do anyone else.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.458
Uh, and look, I know these things aren't
really your thing, so, uh, let's go.

20:46.542 --> 20:47.875
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, wait a second here.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.875
Uh, I just climbed 86 floors up
the side of this building,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.750
the music's still playing
and, um, I think I look kind of dashing.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.834
Do you wanna dance?

21:18.166 --> 21:21.542
I hope you learned that some of those
animals I look after are dangerous.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.709
Now don't go anywhere near
that vampire bat I'm watching, okay?

21:24.792 --> 21:27.000
Don't worry. Learned my lesson.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.041
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.041 --> 22:03.041
<i>Yes!</i>
