LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
This is the best document

00:03.304 --> 00:05.173
that's been leaked.

00:05.206 --> 00:09.810
What is in this book is,
I'm going to say, shocking.

00:09.843 --> 00:15.083
You have the illustrations
of different craft.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.352
I've seen this shape before,
in India.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.188
It's an upside down
vimana shape.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.190
I mean, this is sensational.

00:22.223 --> 00:27.561
HOWE: There is a paragraph in
here that implies some agreement

00:27.595 --> 00:31.265
between the United States
and the extraterrestrials.

00:31.299 --> 00:34.468
"The encounters will take place

00:34.502 --> 00:37.405
at military installations

00:37.438 --> 00:41.375
selected by mutual agreement."

00:41.409 --> 00:45.213
This is solid confirmation
that our government knew,

00:45.246 --> 00:47.148
and was dealing with

00:47.181 --> 00:49.383
extraterrestrial entities
and technology.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.385
This is solid.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.118
NARRATOR: Burbank, California.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.421
December 1984.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.591
Movie producer
and UFO researcher,

01:30.624 --> 01:32.160
Jaime Shandera,

01:32.193 --> 01:35.129
arrives home
to find a manila envelope

01:35.163 --> 01:37.465
has been dropped
through the mail slot

01:37.498 --> 01:38.732
of his front door.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.569
The postmark indicates

01:41.602 --> 01:44.572
that it was sent
from Albuquerque, New Mexico,

01:44.605 --> 01:48.742
but no return address is written
on the envelope.

01:48.776 --> 01:55.249
When he opens it, he finds only
a roll of 35mm film.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.453
And what he had received
was this package right here.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.522
This is the original package.

02:01.555 --> 02:05.426
And inside the package,
there was a roll of film

02:05.459 --> 02:07.661
inside this canister.

02:07.695 --> 02:11.299
And this is actually the roll
of film that he received.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.668
And this film,
when copied properly,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.737
produced these eight pages

02:16.770 --> 02:18.572
of the Eisenhower
Briefing Document.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.678
NARRATOR: The Eisenhower
Briefing Document is a memo

02:24.712 --> 02:27.648
that was allegedly written
in 1952

02:27.681 --> 02:31.519
by the first director of the
CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter,

02:31.552 --> 02:34.588
to President-Elect
Dwight Eisenhower.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.225
In it, Hillenkoetter writes

02:37.258 --> 02:39.427
that sitting president
Harry Truman

02:39.460 --> 02:42.330
has formed a secret group
within the U.S. government,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.432
called The Majestic-12,

02:44.465 --> 02:48.269
to examine crashed
extraterrestrial spacecraft.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.872
WOOD: The document that he
received basically reported

02:51.905 --> 02:54.242
that we had
had previous crashes,

02:54.275 --> 02:57.245
including the one at Roswell.

02:57.278 --> 03:00.648
The bottom line recommendation

03:00.681 --> 03:02.750
to President Eisenhower
was that this topic

03:02.783 --> 03:04.952
continue to be kept secret.

03:04.985 --> 03:09.323
NARRATOR: Aerospace engineer,
Dr. Robert Wood,

03:09.357 --> 03:13.727
was one of the men Shandera
asked to examine this memo.

03:13.761 --> 03:19.500
His 43-year career included work
on aerodynamic heating,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.835
ballistic missile defense,

03:21.869 --> 03:25.673
radar, and the space station.

03:25.706 --> 03:30.278
It is his opinion that this
document is the smoking gun

03:30.311 --> 03:34.282
to prove that the most famous
alleged UFO crash of all time...

03:34.315 --> 03:36.850
The Roswell incident...

03:36.884 --> 03:40.788
Really was an
extraterrestrial event.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.291
WOOD:
For several years, I was looking

03:43.324 --> 03:45.659
at the authenticity of this memo

03:45.693 --> 03:48.929
and trying to relate
to other sources.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.733
In terms of the main ideas
and the statements of fact

03:52.766 --> 03:56.770
in the memo being correct,
I'm-I'm confident that they are.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.774
NARRATOR: The Roswell incident

04:00.808 --> 04:03.777
that is detailed in the
Eisenhower Briefing Document

04:03.811 --> 04:09.417
occurred in 1947, during
Truman's first term in office,

04:09.450 --> 04:12.620
when Eisenhower was
chief of staff of the Army.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.589
On July 7,

04:16.624 --> 04:19.627
an unidentified object
crashed on a ranch

04:19.660 --> 04:23.364
just outside the town
of Roswell, New Mexico.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.700
The next day,
the local newspaper announced

04:26.734 --> 04:29.503
that officials
from the Army Air Field

04:29.537 --> 04:33.674
had reported the capture
of a "flying saucer."

04:33.707 --> 04:38.512
But just a few hours later, the
military revised that statement

04:38.546 --> 04:42.583
to say the object was nothing
more than a weather balloon.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.587
Since that time,
further details have emerged

04:46.620 --> 04:47.988
from alleged insiders,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.691
that not only one craft,
but three,

04:50.724 --> 04:54.562
and even alien bodies
were retrieved that night.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.065
Harry Truman is President
of the United States.

04:58.098 --> 05:02.403
Dwight D. Eisenhower,
General Nathan Twining,

05:02.436 --> 05:06.707
these people
would be the very first

05:06.740 --> 05:09.076
that would get these calls.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.879
And there was some sort
of a communication glitch.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.648
That's how that headline
made it out.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.385
That one headline
was telling the truth

05:17.418 --> 05:18.919
that this government
did not want

05:18.952 --> 05:21.088
information about non-humans

05:21.121 --> 05:25.025
out to what their
perceived enemies were.

05:25.058 --> 05:29.397
And Harry S. Truman...
A practical man, in every way...

05:29.430 --> 05:31.665
Looking at this whole situation,

05:31.699 --> 05:36.704
he must have said,
"I need help I can trust."

05:36.737 --> 05:38.806
DOUGLAS CADDY: If you were
President Truman in 1947,

05:38.839 --> 05:40.908
and you were presented
with credible evidence

05:40.941 --> 05:42.776
that there was an alien presence

05:42.810 --> 05:45.613
on planet Earth,
what would you do?

05:45.646 --> 05:49.082
You would create a commission
to study what is going on,

05:49.116 --> 05:51.785
and make recommendations
and explore the subject.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.821
What did
President Harry Truman do?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.856
He created Majestic-12.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.860
He created
the National Security Act.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.430
He created
the National Security Council,

06:02.463 --> 06:05.399
and he created the CIA,
all at the same time

06:05.433 --> 06:07.735
in response to this threat.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.972
MIKE BARA: The U.S. government
decided it needed to have

06:12.005 --> 06:14.174
a main central
oversight committee

06:14.207 --> 06:16.677
that would handle
the so-called alien problem.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.413
The mission of MJ-12

06:19.447 --> 06:22.115
was to decide on what the
United States government policy

06:22.149 --> 06:25.553
should be towards aliens
and extraterrestrials,

06:25.586 --> 06:28.155
what it should be towards
releasing the information

06:28.188 --> 06:30.491
or keeping it secret.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.193
And they were empowered
to ultimately decide

06:33.226 --> 06:35.696
everything regarding
the presence of aliens

06:35.729 --> 06:37.665
on the planet Earth.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.100
NARRATOR: President Eisenhower's

06:40.133 --> 06:42.970
great-granddaughter,
Laura Eisenhower,

06:43.003 --> 06:47.040
claims that the Majestic-12
was a real organization,

06:47.074 --> 06:50.878
and that her great-grandfather
had no choice but to continue

06:50.911 --> 06:54.482
what his predecessor,
Harry Truman, had started.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.684
President Eisenhower
was definitely, uh,

06:56.717 --> 06:58.719
in a very challenged position
as far as

06:58.752 --> 07:01.455
how to handle the exo-political
issues going on.

07:01.489 --> 07:05.058
Uh, he was actually
the scapegoat or somebody, uh,

07:05.092 --> 07:07.461
everybody could later blame
for some of the things

07:07.495 --> 07:09.630
that are happening,
that is actually MJ-12.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.632
This is the hidden
shadow government.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.635
He wasn't able to do anything
about it.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.037
But the ones
that were close to him knew

07:17.070 --> 07:19.973
that he was going to put out
this information for the public.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.109
And it got shut down.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.578
They even had a planned date,
and nothing ended up happening.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.950
NARRATOR: March 1994.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.521
Almost a decade
after Jaime Shandera received

07:33.554 --> 07:35.723
the Eisenhower
Briefing Document,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.825
Majestic-12 researchers

07:37.858 --> 07:41.862
are shocked when a second roll
of film surfaces.

07:41.895 --> 07:46.634
This time it is sent anonymously
to a UFO group in Maryland

07:46.667 --> 07:51.038
from Quillin's drugstore
in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.742
Investigative journalist,
Linda MOULTON Howe,

07:54.775 --> 07:58.779
was among the first
to examine these documents,

07:58.812 --> 08:01.615
and she has been conducting
research on MJ-12

08:01.649 --> 08:04.652
for more than two decades.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.757
In April 2017,

08:09.790 --> 08:12.860
editor and researcher,
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS,

08:12.893 --> 08:15.763
traveled to
Albuquerque, New Mexico

08:15.796 --> 08:19.533
to meet with Linda
and find out what she knows

08:19.567 --> 08:22.603
about these
mysterious documents.

08:22.636 --> 08:26.039
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: So if I
understand this correctly,

08:26.073 --> 08:30.143
the first documentation of
the MJ-12 files came in the form

08:30.177 --> 08:32.546
of 35mm negatives,

08:32.580 --> 08:34.914
that somebody, at some point,
took photos

08:34.948 --> 08:37.784
of a document that existed
in paper form.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.320
Do we know who did this?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.624
Who took those photographs?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.627
Throughout my experience
as a reporter,

08:46.660 --> 08:49.062
there are people who have served
in the military

08:49.096 --> 08:52.666
or CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO,
and they are out there,

08:52.700 --> 08:56.336
and they have grudges,
they are angry,

08:56.369 --> 08:59.339
they feel that this story
should come out,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.775
or that they have been
infringed against.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.744
And in this case,

09:03.777 --> 09:06.279
this might have been somebody
who had this manual

09:06.313 --> 09:08.281
in their work,

09:08.315 --> 09:09.783
photographed it,

09:09.817 --> 09:11.184
maybe right there
at the pharmacy,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
and the rest is history.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.890
Of all the documents
that I've ever seen and studied,

09:16.924 --> 09:19.727
it is this restricted SOM1-01,

09:19.760 --> 09:22.796
Majestic-12 Group
Special Operations Manual

09:22.830 --> 09:25.799
that I think
is really confirmation.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.802
It goes beyond disclosure,
because...

09:28.836 --> 09:31.872
this is April 1954,
Majestic-12 Group.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.975
It's the War Office stamp;
It is real.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.376
And, the title:

09:36.409 --> 09:38.378
"Extraterrestrial Entities

09:38.411 --> 09:41.248
"and Technology Recovery
and Disposal.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.184
Top Secret. Majic Eyes Only."

09:44.217 --> 09:45.953
And in here,

09:45.986 --> 09:49.857
"majic" is defined as the top,

09:49.890 --> 09:52.259
the highest
national security clearance

09:52.292 --> 09:53.961
in the United States.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.863
TSOUKALOS: This is sensational.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.170
NARRATOR: Did the United States
government learn

10:03.203 --> 10:06.774
about an alien presence on Earth
in the 1940s,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.877
and devise
a top secret committee

10:09.910 --> 10:13.046
to investigate
this shocking revelation?

10:13.080 --> 10:17.184
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

10:17.217 --> 10:22.055
and suggest further examination
of the MJ-12 documents reveals

10:22.089 --> 10:27.160
that the government was not only
aware of extraterrestrials,

10:27.194 --> 10:30.330
but also interacted with them.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.245
NARRATOR:
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

10:45.278 --> 10:49.016
Ancient astronaut theorist
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS

10:49.049 --> 10:52.252
is at the home
of Linda MOULTON Howe.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.088
After examining
all of the material

10:55.122 --> 10:57.057
related to the Majestic-12,

10:57.090 --> 11:00.761
she believes that
the most compelling documents

11:00.794 --> 11:04.331
are those that surfaced
in Maryland in 1994.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.000
This, to me,

11:07.034 --> 11:09.703
this is the best document
that's been leaked.

11:09.737 --> 11:14.141
It's called "Restricted SOM1-01.
Majestic-12 Group."

11:14.174 --> 11:17.344
And all of us,
when we first saw that title,

11:17.377 --> 11:19.847
"Extraterrestrial Entities
and Technology,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.849
Recovery and Disposal,"

11:21.882 --> 11:24.017
one of the first things
that everybody wanted to do

11:24.051 --> 11:26.053
was find out, okay, did they use

11:26.086 --> 11:29.222
this stamp in 1954

11:29.256 --> 11:31.058
from the War Office?

11:31.091 --> 11:34.294
Turns out that they did
all the way up into the '60s.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.064
And one of
the more important pieces,

11:37.097 --> 11:41.101
I think,
is as you go through here...

11:41.134 --> 11:44.037
they found, in a government
printing office...

11:44.071 --> 11:46.273
Take a look at this.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.077
This is from a blowup
where they were doing a test,

11:50.110 --> 11:52.445
and look at this "unauthorized"

11:52.479 --> 11:54.748
and look at what happens
to that "Z."

11:54.782 --> 11:56.449
It raises slightly.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.086
- Right.
- So, Bob went

11:59.119 --> 12:01.054
to the government
printing office

12:01.088 --> 12:03.256
and found a guy named McCarter

12:03.290 --> 12:06.026
who was printing in the GPO

12:06.059 --> 12:09.162
in Washington, D.C. in 1954.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.932
And he took one look
at this text

12:11.965 --> 12:15.068
and he said,
"This was done on a monotype.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.336
"I used it.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.839
"And the 'Z' would collect dust,

12:18.872 --> 12:22.375
and that's why the Zs
would print raised."

12:22.409 --> 12:24.044
So different steps

12:24.077 --> 12:27.247
have been taken
to authenticate this document.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.782
HOWE: Yes.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.386
The fellow I spoke to,
he, fortunately,

12:33.420 --> 12:37.057
had been a long, longtime
employee of the public printer

12:37.090 --> 12:40.360
and had actually worked
on the kind of presses

12:40.393 --> 12:43.463
that he thought were appropriate
for this document.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.099
He said,
"Based on the printing, I'd say

12:46.133 --> 12:48.268
"it clearly was printed
on one of the presses,

12:48.301 --> 12:50.938
"in this building or
in this basement of the Pentagon

12:50.971 --> 12:55.342
"in 1954," which is what it says.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.344
HOWE: And then when you start

12:57.377 --> 13:01.381
getting into
what is in this book,

13:01.414 --> 13:05.518
you have the illustrations
and sketches

13:05.552 --> 13:08.288
of four different categories

13:08.321 --> 13:10.557
of different craft, UFOs.

13:10.590 --> 13:14.327
And on this page,
here are the discs.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.964
Here is a long cigar shape,

13:16.997 --> 13:19.332
which is described
in this document

13:19.366 --> 13:23.170
as being up to a thousand feet
in diameter.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.840
And then, this one,
the ice cream cone,

13:26.874 --> 13:30.277
and this, the triangle.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.579
And there is a paragraph in here
that implies

13:32.612 --> 13:36.349
that we are dealing
with collaboration,

13:36.383 --> 13:39.019
that there must be

13:39.052 --> 13:42.555
some agreement
between the United States

13:42.589 --> 13:45.292
- and the extraterrestrials.
- Really?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.261
There is, on this page 17...

13:48.295 --> 13:49.629
It's under chapter five,

13:49.662 --> 13:53.433
and it goes into,
"a. Encounters initiated

13:53.466 --> 13:56.870
"by the extraterrestrial
biological entities.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.072
"Possible contact may take place

13:59.106 --> 14:02.309
"as a result of overtures
by the entities themselves.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.178
"In these instances
it is anticipated

14:05.212 --> 14:07.314
"that encounters will take place

14:07.347 --> 14:10.117
"at military installations

14:10.150 --> 14:12.886
"or other obscure locations

14:12.920 --> 14:16.189
selected by mutual agreement."

14:16.223 --> 14:17.934
- TSOUKALOS: By mutual...
- This is 19... Yeah.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.426
- Wow.
- 1954.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.331
NARRATOR: According
to the Majestic-12 documents,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.633
the men who made up this group

14:26.666 --> 14:30.037
and were in communication
with beings from other worlds

14:30.070 --> 14:33.540
included top scientists,
government officials

14:33.573 --> 14:36.409
and high-ranking
military personnel.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.614
In 1954, President Eisenhower,

14:41.648 --> 14:44.017
uh, supposedly met
with, uh, extraterrestrials

14:44.051 --> 14:46.653
in Palm Springs
at Edwards Air Force Base,

14:46.686 --> 14:48.421
otherwise known as Muroc.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.291
And there's a lot
of whistleblower testimony

14:51.324 --> 14:53.560
about his presence,
um, at this meeting.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.296
He was just as probably alarmed
or shocked as anybody,

14:56.329 --> 14:58.165
you know,
realizing the larger picture.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.632
With all
the whistleblower testimony

14:59.666 --> 15:01.935
about these different
encounters,

15:01.969 --> 15:04.471
I pretty much side on the fact
that he-he did make contact.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.240
One of the interesting members
of MJ-12

15:07.274 --> 15:09.943
was Doctor... Professor...
Donald Menzel...

15:12.145 --> 15:13.622
who actually
had written three books

15:13.646 --> 15:15.382
on the subject

15:15.415 --> 15:18.118
that had the general flavor
of-of debunking it.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.953
And I read this book,
and I said,

15:19.987 --> 15:23.390
"Here's a guy who's allegedly
a Ph.D. in physics,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.725
but he's obviously
ignoring the data."

15:25.758 --> 15:29.196
I'm highly confident
that Dr. Menzel

15:29.229 --> 15:31.564
was working
in a counterintelligence mode.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.034
He was intentionally trying
to deceive the public

15:34.067 --> 15:35.535
that there was nothing to it.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.670
So, I personally met him,
shook hands with him

15:37.704 --> 15:40.473
and carefully avoided
any discussion of UFOs.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.609
And he knew perfectly well

15:42.642 --> 15:46.179
that we had recovered a number
of crashed flying saucers.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.582
Let's go to one of these

15:49.616 --> 15:50.750
that is so important,

15:50.783 --> 15:53.553
to July 4, 1947.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.490
Look, see those all cap letters, "IPU"?
Mmhmm.

15:57.524 --> 16:01.528
Date: 04 July '47.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.096
What was happening that we know?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.465
- Roswell.
- Exactly.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.501
IPU stands for
Interplanetary Phenomena Unit?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.703
That's it.

16:10.737 --> 16:15.075
And this is, "Directive
to Lieutenant General Twining"

16:15.108 --> 16:17.444
- "from Dwight Eisenhower."
- Eisenhower. Wow.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.081
In the general chain of command.
Uhhuh.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
And what he's doing is,
"You will proceed

16:23.150 --> 16:27.087
"to the White Sands
Proving Ground Command Center

16:27.120 --> 16:30.490
"without delay for the purpose
of making an appraisal

16:30.523 --> 16:33.026
"of the reported
unidentified objects

16:33.060 --> 16:34.561
being kept there."

16:34.594 --> 16:38.598
This is not only disclosure.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.333
It's confirmation.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.802
I mean, that's incredibly
fascinating to me.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.038
And in many ways, GIORGIO,

16:45.072 --> 16:47.607
this is one of the more
astounding documents

16:47.640 --> 16:51.178
because this
is General Nathan Twining,

16:51.211 --> 16:53.280
and what is he talking about?

16:53.313 --> 16:56.249
"Upon examination
of the interior of the craft,

16:56.283 --> 16:59.819
"a compartment exhibiting
a possible atomic engine

16:59.852 --> 17:02.589
"was discovered.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.691
At least, this is the opinion
of Dr. Oppenheimer."

17:04.723 --> 17:06.259
Robert Oppenheimer,

17:06.292 --> 17:08.027
the one who made the bomb.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.699
NARRATOR:
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer

17:12.732 --> 17:14.701
is often credited

17:14.733 --> 17:17.069
as being the father
of the atomic bomb

17:17.104 --> 17:20.772
for his work
on the Manhattan Project.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.676
"A possibility exists
that part of the craft itself

17:24.711 --> 17:27.614
"comprises
the propulsion system,

17:27.646 --> 17:31.851
"thus allowing the reactor
to function as a heat exchanger

17:31.884 --> 17:34.321
"and permitting
the storage of energy

17:34.354 --> 17:37.224
into a substance for later use."

17:37.257 --> 17:38.758
And what they mean,

17:38.791 --> 17:41.628
we all today
have a bit of an idea

17:41.661 --> 17:44.397
that you could have
an entire craft

17:44.431 --> 17:47.700
be both the propulsion system,
the craft system.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.471
It might even be
a, uh, point to point,

17:51.504 --> 17:54.341
go through dimensions
and timelines in the UFO.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.277
That's 21st century discussion.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.613
This is back
in the week of the discovery

18:00.647 --> 18:02.682
of the bodies and the craft.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.185
I mean, that... This is sensational.
It is.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.525
NARRATOR: If the Majestic-12
documents provide proof

18:12.559 --> 18:14.494
that the United States
government

18:14.527 --> 18:16.896
employed its top scientists

18:16.929 --> 18:21.734
to examine and reverse-engineer
extraterrestrial craft,

18:21.768 --> 18:24.571
how have they been able
to keep this hidden

18:24.604 --> 18:27.674
from the public
for all these years?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.877
Perhaps further clues
can be found

18:30.910 --> 18:32.679
by examining the death

18:32.712 --> 18:35.448
of the first man
allegedly appointed

18:35.482 --> 18:37.684
to lead the Majestic-12,

18:37.717 --> 18:40.653
as well as the assassination

18:40.687 --> 18:43.290
of John F. Kennedy.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.365
NARRATOR: Bethesda, Maryland.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.602
May 22, 1949.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.205
James Forrestal,

18:58.238 --> 19:01.174
the first United States
Secretary of Defense,

19:01.208 --> 19:03.476
is found dead
at the naval hospital.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.614
He reportedly fell
from a 16th floor window

19:07.647 --> 19:10.683
after being committed
for depression.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.753
His death was ruled a suicide,

19:13.786 --> 19:17.590
but many have challenged
this conclusion

19:17.624 --> 19:20.393
and believe Forrestal
was assassinated

19:20.427 --> 19:22.462
because he was threatening
to go public

19:22.495 --> 19:24.597
with information he had acquired

19:24.631 --> 19:27.934
about an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.271
James Forrestal was one of
the most significant

19:31.304 --> 19:34.841
military figures in the history
of the United States.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.311
He was Secretary of the Navy
during and after World War II.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.979
He was eventually appointed

19:40.012 --> 19:43.316
the very first Secretary of
Defense of the United States,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.385
and he visited all of these

19:45.418 --> 19:47.820
secret German
technology facilities

19:47.854 --> 19:48.988
after the war.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.623
He went to Peenemunde,

19:50.657 --> 19:51.891
he went to Mittelwerk,

19:51.924 --> 19:52.935
he went to the different places

19:52.959 --> 19:54.661
where they had developed
the V-2.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.963
And he also visited
this really interesting

19:56.996 --> 19:59.832
so-called "rubber plant"
in Silesia,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.702
which is where the Germans
were supposedly developing

20:02.735 --> 20:05.905
the very, very high technology,
super hyperphysics weapons

20:05.938 --> 20:09.742
and weapon systems,
like flying saucers.

20:09.776 --> 20:13.646
Some believe that during
the Second World War,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.316
James Forrestal discovered

20:16.349 --> 20:20.353
that the Nazis had acquired
extraterrestrial technology.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.623
Perhaps not coincidentally,

20:23.656 --> 20:25.525
they say that after the war,

20:25.558 --> 20:29.596
President Truman
put Forrestal in charge

20:29.629 --> 20:31.998
of a secret investigation
into all this,

20:32.031 --> 20:34.434
heading up an organization

20:34.467 --> 20:37.003
known as Majestic-12 or MJ-12.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.540
CADDY:
There's a lot of controversy

20:40.573 --> 20:43.610
about Secretary Forrestal's
final years.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.678
He was on MJ-12.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.780
He became familiar
what was transpiring

20:47.814 --> 20:49.449
with the alien presence.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.883
And there's always
been a question:

20:50.917 --> 20:52.352
Was this a suicide?

20:52.385 --> 20:53.520
Was he pushed?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.621
What really happened?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.891
BARA: Some people say
that Forrestal was determined

20:58.925 --> 21:01.060
to tell the American public
about what he had seen

21:01.093 --> 21:03.563
regarding the alien presence,

21:03.596 --> 21:05.732
the alien influence
on Nazi technology,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.967
and that when he wanted
to go public with this,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.403
that they created
a fake backstory

21:10.437 --> 21:11.738
of him being despondent

21:11.771 --> 21:13.773
and murdered him
by literally throwing him

21:13.806 --> 21:16.776
out of the 16th floor window
of the hospital facility

21:16.809 --> 21:18.311
he had been imprisoned in.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.313
NARRATOR: Is it possible

21:20.347 --> 21:22.449
that James Forrestal
was silenced

21:22.482 --> 21:25.385
to keep him
from revealing the truth

21:25.418 --> 21:27.620
about an alien presence
here on Earth?

21:28.855 --> 21:32.459
There was a release of another...

21:32.492 --> 21:35.462
I'm going to say shocking...
Document.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.366
NARRATOR:
As extraordinary as the notion

21:39.399 --> 21:41.734
of Forrestal's assassination
may seem,

21:41.768 --> 21:44.471
ancient astronaut theorists
propose

21:44.504 --> 21:46.906
that one of
the Majestic-12 documents

21:46.939 --> 21:48.708
points to the assassination

21:48.741 --> 21:51.744
of an even higher-level
government official.

21:51.778 --> 21:55.615
HOWE: The story is that it was
supposed to have been destroyed,

21:55.648 --> 21:59.519
and somebody
put it in a fireplace,

21:59.552 --> 22:01.688
and that another person
pulled it out.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.790
So what does it say?

22:03.823 --> 22:07.026
"Top Secret MJ-12,
Central Intelligence Agency.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.629
"From: Director of...

22:09.662 --> 22:12.064
Central Intelligence Agency
(MJ-1)."

22:12.098 --> 22:14.601
Who was that?
That was Allen Dulles.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.937
'60 to '63, under Kennedy.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.509
Okay. "You must know."

22:22.542 --> 22:25.412
"Lancer has made some inquiries

22:25.445 --> 22:28.581
regarding our activities."

22:28.615 --> 22:31.718
And Lancer, during
the Kennedy administration,

22:31.751 --> 22:34.987
was the secret service name
for the president.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.925
This is the head
of the CIA, MJ-1...

22:38.958 --> 22:41.728
Going against the president's
wishes of finding out more.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.464
HOWE: "Which we cannot allow."

22:44.497 --> 22:49.135
"Please submit your views
no later than October."

22:49.168 --> 22:52.071
If that was in '63,

22:52.104 --> 22:55.775
he was dead one month later
in Dallas.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.780
And, in fact, Bob Wood told me...

23:00.813 --> 23:02.882
This was in a report I did...

23:02.915 --> 23:06.819
"Linda, as far as I know, this
burned memo is the only document

23:06.853 --> 23:10.423
"that I've ever heard anyone
claim could be the authorization

23:10.457 --> 23:13.826
to kill
President John F. Kennedy."

23:13.860 --> 23:16.429
(TSOUKALOS gasps)

23:16.463 --> 23:18.130
I mean,
that's an extraordinary claim.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.601
It's, uh,
absolutely fascinating,

23:21.634 --> 23:23.970
and unlike anything
I've ever heard before.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.973
The inference of
the scorched memo is that

23:27.006 --> 23:29.542
if JFK keeps doing
what he's doing,

23:29.576 --> 23:33.112
that he, maybe, is a problem.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.683
It identifies a number of
actions that could be taken.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.751
One of which, the last one,

23:38.785 --> 23:42.689
implies that if Washington
does not respond

23:42.722 --> 23:45.925
to what they want done,
it should be wet.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.562
And that's the language I think
the Soviets started to use

23:49.596 --> 23:52.932
for-for assassination, because
"wet" is associated with blood.

23:55.001 --> 23:58.638
NARRATOR: If the Majestic-12
documents are indeed authentic,

23:58.671 --> 24:01.808
are they proof
that not only were members

24:01.841 --> 24:03.976
of the United States government
aware of...

24:04.010 --> 24:05.978
And in contact with...

24:06.012 --> 24:07.880
Extraterrestrial beings,

24:07.914 --> 24:10.783
but also that they would
go to any length

24:10.817 --> 24:14.186
to keep this information
hidden from the public?

24:14.220 --> 24:18.157
Former Washington, D.C. attorney
Douglas Caddy

24:18.190 --> 24:21.694
was a close friend
of E. Howard Hunt,

24:21.728 --> 24:24.664
who he represented
when Hunt was found to be

24:24.697 --> 24:28.601
at the center of
the Watergate scandal in 1972.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.170
Hunt was an officer in the CIA

24:31.203 --> 24:33.673
when John F. Kennedy
was president.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.709
Caddy claims
that he asked Howard Hunt

24:36.743 --> 24:38.778
about the assassination
one night

24:38.811 --> 24:42.749
and received a shocking answer.

24:42.782 --> 24:46.118
The last time I saw Howard Hunt
was in 1975.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.954
(phone rings)

24:47.987 --> 24:50.723
He called me and said
he'd like to have dinner.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.059
So the dinner was finished,
we went out to the sidewalk.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.137
And I thought, "Well this may be
the last time I'll see Howard."

24:55.161 --> 24:58.130
He's going away
and I'm moving from Washington."

24:58.164 --> 25:00.833
And so, for my own curiosity,
I said to Howard,

25:00.867 --> 25:02.935
"Why was John Kennedy
assassinated?"

25:07.574 --> 25:10.677
CADDY: And he said,
"John Kennedy was assassinated

25:10.710 --> 25:12.945
"because he was about to give
our most vital secret

25:12.979 --> 25:14.814
to the Soviet Union."

25:14.847 --> 25:16.683
And I said,
"Our most vital secret?"

25:16.716 --> 25:18.284
I said, "What could that be?"

25:18.317 --> 25:20.953
He leaned forward
and-and looked me in the eyes

25:20.987 --> 25:23.590
and he said,
"The alien presence."

25:23.623 --> 25:26.025
He shook my hand
and walked away.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.996
NARRATOR: If the stories
about the Majestic-12 are true,

25:30.029 --> 25:33.032
and those involved
with the top-secret group

25:33.065 --> 25:35.568
were ready to take
such drastic measures

25:35.602 --> 25:37.303
to keep its existence hidden,

25:37.336 --> 25:40.172
was it ever discontinued?

25:40.206 --> 25:42.208
Do you think that MJ-12

25:42.241 --> 25:45.177
is still in existence today?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.179
Well, what I've been told

25:47.213 --> 25:49.849
is that they have
changed the letters

25:49.882 --> 25:51.784
and the numbers,

25:51.818 --> 25:53.920
probably more than once.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.122
So it's the same idea,

25:56.155 --> 25:59.125
it's the same control,
same files,

25:59.158 --> 26:01.961
same archives, same power.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.865
If you look at what has happened
in the last 60 years,

26:05.898 --> 26:09.802
it's really possible that
more decisions have been made

26:09.836 --> 26:13.139
in a side of our government
because of this subject...

26:13.172 --> 26:15.808
E.T.s and technology...

26:15.842 --> 26:17.810
Than any of us would ever know.

26:24.684 --> 26:28.354
NARRATOR: July 20, 1969.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.924
Six years after President
Kennedy's assassination,

26:31.958 --> 26:34.093
American astronauts
Neil Armstrong

26:34.126 --> 26:35.795
and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin

26:35.828 --> 26:39.198
become the first humans
to land on the Moon.

26:39.231 --> 26:42.735
ARMSTRONG:
That's one small step for man,

26:42.769 --> 26:46.172
one giant leap for mankind.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.776
NARRATOR:
But there are some who believe

26:49.809 --> 26:52.812
this was not
the first moon landing,

26:52.845 --> 26:56.248
and that other highly-classified
missions preceded it.

26:59.919 --> 27:03.890
In 2014, declassified documents

27:03.923 --> 27:07.226
revealed that the United States
had a secret project underway

27:07.259 --> 27:09.028
in 1959

27:09.061 --> 27:11.397
to not just reach the Moon,

27:11.430 --> 27:13.766
but even establish
military bases there

27:13.800 --> 27:16.302
by 1965.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.080
- We choose to go to the Moon...
- BARA: When President Kennedy

27:18.104 --> 27:20.006
said we're gonna go to the Moon,

27:20.039 --> 27:22.241
there were many, many
proposals on the table.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.110
One of them was called
Project Horizon.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.245
And the idea behind
Project Horizon

27:26.278 --> 27:29.048
was that we would launch
more than 140 rockets

27:29.081 --> 27:31.984
up into low-Earth orbit,

27:32.018 --> 27:35.354
assemble basically
empty fuel containers...

27:35.387 --> 27:38.024
Large tubes...
Send them to the Moon,

27:38.057 --> 27:40.159
soft-land them on the Moon
and assemble them together

27:40.192 --> 27:41.861
into a permanent Moon base

27:41.894 --> 27:43.896
that would start
with about 20 astronauts,

27:43.930 --> 27:46.766
and eventually
be populated by hundreds.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.443
The idea being that
we would establish a permanent

27:48.467 --> 27:51.838
military presence
on the surface of the Moon.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.309
NARRATOR: Project Horizon
was the brainchild

27:57.343 --> 28:01.147
of Wernher Von Braun,
the former Nazi rocket scientist

28:01.180 --> 28:03.215
whose multi-stage rocket design

28:03.249 --> 28:05.952
is still used today.

28:05.985 --> 28:09.889
And who, according
to the Majestic-12 documents,

28:09.922 --> 28:13.760
was one of the men that worked
on reverse engineering

28:13.793 --> 28:15.294
the extraterrestrial craft

28:15.327 --> 28:17.997
that crashed
in Roswell, New Mexico.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.236
In addition to establishing
bases on the Moon,

28:24.270 --> 28:26.839
Wernher Von Braun
had another goal:

28:26.873 --> 28:28.274
To reach Mars.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.877
He considered this
to be achievable

28:30.910 --> 28:34.313
even as far back the 1960s.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.183
And there are those who claim
that the United States,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.285
and other nations,

28:39.318 --> 28:41.821
have bases there right now.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.991
One of the first
alleged missions to Mars

28:45.024 --> 28:48.027
was a project
called Solar Warden.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.197
At least one person,
Corey Goode,

28:51.230 --> 28:54.300
has come forward to say
that he was recruited

28:54.333 --> 28:56.502
for Project Solar Warden.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.106
According to Corey,
he was targeted

29:00.139 --> 29:02.508
because his grandfather
was involved

29:02.541 --> 29:05.111
in another secret project
that took place

29:05.144 --> 29:08.280
around the same time MJ-12

29:08.314 --> 29:11.784
was allegedly formed:
Project Whitecoat.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.290
GOODE: Project Whitecoat
was set up during World War II.

29:18.324 --> 29:21.093
Officially, they were
taking soldiers

29:21.127 --> 29:23.362
and experimenting on them
with viruses.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.097
Well, it turns out that

29:25.131 --> 29:26.933
our government was
working with genetics

29:26.966 --> 29:30.569
far before we supposedly
discovered them in the '50s.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.505
Genetics were being manipulated,

29:33.539 --> 29:35.207
and genetic changes

29:35.241 --> 29:37.977
were being delivered to people
through viruses.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.847
My grandfather happened to be
one of these participants.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.282
They were keeping an eye
on my lineage

29:43.315 --> 29:45.985
because of this program.

29:46.018 --> 29:49.055
And they brought me
into this training program

29:49.088 --> 29:51.190
that would last from the age
of about six-years-old

29:51.223 --> 29:54.060
to about 17-years-old,

29:54.093 --> 29:56.495
when I was officially drafted
into Solar Warden.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.268
Very soon after
joining the space program,

30:02.301 --> 30:04.470
I was assigned
to a research vessel.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.505
I was doing communications.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.441
A subprogram that I was a part
of in the beginning was called

30:09.475 --> 30:12.511
the Intruder Intercept
and Interrogation Program.

30:12.544 --> 30:16.148
Different beings were living
on our planet amongst us,

30:16.182 --> 30:20.052
and the mandate
was to capture these beings,

30:20.086 --> 30:23.555
interrogate them,
and find out why they were here.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.926
The United States
secret space program...

30:26.959 --> 30:29.561
Its roots actually go back
to Nazi Germany.

30:29.595 --> 30:32.131
A lot of the scientists
that we obtained

30:32.164 --> 30:34.100
in Operation Paperclip

30:34.133 --> 30:37.904
were in contact
with the breakaway society

30:37.937 --> 30:40.039
that had already
developed spacecraft.

30:40.072 --> 30:44.510
Currently, there are at least
three dozen nations involved.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.545
Some of the countries
involved right now

30:46.578 --> 30:48.547
are countries like Estonia,

30:48.580 --> 30:52.318
the Ukraine, and, uh, of course,
we have the larger players:

30:52.351 --> 30:56.555
The United States,
China, Germany, Russia.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.625
Britain is also a large player
in the secret space program.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.474
DAVID WILCOCK: If this seems
impossible to believe,

31:06.498 --> 31:10.269
remember that
the Manhattan Project

31:10.302 --> 31:12.471
was an operation
for almost ten years

31:12.504 --> 31:15.241
in the development
of the nuclear bomb.

31:17.643 --> 31:21.447
It employed over 130,000 people.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.350
Not one person came forward

31:24.383 --> 31:26.986
with information about
what they were working on.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.588
That proves that the government
can keep a secret.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.462
NARRATOR: Could there really be
over 30 different countries

31:36.495 --> 31:39.131
with secret operations
in outer space...

31:43.202 --> 31:46.973
working at bases
on both the Moon and Mars?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.975
According to Corey Goode,

31:49.008 --> 31:51.510
not only is this true,

31:51.543 --> 31:54.513
but the first members
of these secret space programs

31:54.546 --> 31:58.450
found that when they reached
these celestial bodies,

31:58.484 --> 32:02.388
they were not
the first visitors.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.657
GOODE: When the secret
space program began to travel

32:05.691 --> 32:07.593
to other bodies
in our solar system,

32:07.626 --> 32:10.629
they were finding
ancient structures.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.265
They quickly dubbed the people

32:13.299 --> 32:16.168
that built these structures
"the ancient builder race."

32:16.202 --> 32:20.339
GOODE: What our astronauts
were mainly finding

32:20.372 --> 32:23.976
were structures that had been
destroyed a long time ago,

32:24.010 --> 32:28.014
and they were
very interesting structures.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.049
Some of them were floating
off of the ground

32:30.082 --> 32:32.351
and were mostly complete.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.553
Others were
completely shattered.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.491
BARA: You can find
all the proof you want

32:39.525 --> 32:41.460
that there are ancient

32:41.493 --> 32:44.463
extraterrestrial inhabitations
of the planet Mars

32:44.496 --> 32:47.733
and our own Moon just by looking
at the NASA pictures.

32:47.766 --> 32:52.204
You'll see pyramids,
you'll see bridges.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.673
And you see all kinds of
so-called rocks

32:54.706 --> 32:56.675
that do not appear to be rocks.

32:56.708 --> 33:01.280
I have seen numerous images of
what appear to be structures

33:01.313 --> 33:04.416
that may or may not be active,
and may or may not be inhabited.

33:04.450 --> 33:08.287
CHILDRESS: Perhaps we
are now on both the Moon

33:08.320 --> 33:11.523
and Mars with brand-new

33:11.557 --> 33:15.561
space installations
that are using

33:15.594 --> 33:19.331
ancient structures
that were built thousands

33:19.365 --> 33:21.367
and even millions of years ago.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.540
NARRATOR: Could Corey Goode's
incredible claims be true?

33:28.574 --> 33:32.044
Is Project Solar Warden

33:32.078 --> 33:35.314
the product of plans put
in motion by the Majestic-12

33:35.347 --> 33:38.817
decades ago to deal with
an extraterrestrial presence

33:38.850 --> 33:40.786
in our solar system?

33:40.819 --> 33:45.791
Nearly 20 years after the first
Majestic-12 documents surfaced,

33:45.824 --> 33:49.195
a computer hacker
named Gary McKinnon

33:49.228 --> 33:52.064
claimed to have discovered
the strongest evidence yet

33:52.098 --> 33:54.666
to support their authenticity

33:54.700 --> 33:57.669
within the secret files of NASA.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.413
NARRATOR: London, England.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.616
March 19, 2002.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.319
At 8:00 a.m.,

34:13.351 --> 34:15.454
the National
High Tech Crime Unit

34:15.487 --> 34:18.090
arrives at the home
of 34-year-old

34:18.123 --> 34:21.427
Scottish systems administrator
Gary McKinnon.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.829
They are there to arrest him

34:23.862 --> 34:28.400
on behalf of the United States
Justice Department and NASA.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.670
For the past year,

34:31.703 --> 34:34.373
McKinnon has been hacking
into top secret Pentagon

34:34.406 --> 34:37.743
and NASA computers.

34:37.775 --> 34:41.112
What he uncovered were files
that he claims

34:41.147 --> 34:44.750
could provide undeniable proof
that the Majestic-12,

34:44.783 --> 34:47.686
and the secret space program
it gave rise to,

34:47.719 --> 34:49.588
truly exist.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.391
Among the things I found,

34:52.424 --> 34:54.393
there was an Excel
spreadsheet entitled.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.761
"Non-Terrestrial Officers,"

34:55.793 --> 34:57.829
which I took to be

34:57.863 --> 35:02.401
a space-going fleet made
of human personnel, not aliens.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.403
It did list their names,
and I couldn't find them

35:04.436 --> 35:05.637
on the Internet at the time.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.706
There was also a list of ships.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.342
I googled the ship names
and there were no matches,

35:10.376 --> 35:12.611
so I knew they weren't
oceangoing vessels.

35:12.644 --> 35:17.149
Interestingly, some of the names
of these ships

35:17.183 --> 35:22.521
were people allegedly involved
in Majestic-12.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.756
If there was a secret
space program,

35:24.790 --> 35:27.426
and if it has anything to do
with back engineering

35:27.459 --> 35:29.561
crashed alien spacecraft,

35:29.595 --> 35:33.465
then those MJ-12 people
are exactly the ones

35:33.499 --> 35:36.568
you would expect to find
name-checked in this way.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.605
NARRATOR: According to McKinnon,

35:39.638 --> 35:43.442
the most shocking file he
came across was on a computer

35:43.475 --> 35:45.477
at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

35:45.511 --> 35:49.515
Within a folder labeled
"unfiltered," he spotted

35:49.548 --> 35:53.485
a thumbnail image of a high-res
NASA satellite photo,

35:53.519 --> 35:58.690
which appeared to depict
an unusual spacecraft.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.526
I double-clicked on this image,

36:00.559 --> 36:02.494
and it was coming down
very slowly.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.431
But I could see this, um,
tubular...

36:05.464 --> 36:09.235
A classic cigar-shaped UFO,
uh, with these kind of

36:09.268 --> 36:11.437
geodesic domes,
like half a golf ball

36:11.470 --> 36:13.305
stuck on top and underneath.

36:13.339 --> 36:16.675
And, um, I'm just amazed,
because I've found real evidence

36:16.708 --> 36:18.977
of what I thought was a UFO,

36:19.010 --> 36:22.481
although it could have been
a secret spaceship; Who knows?

36:22.514 --> 36:25.317
Uh, but there it was in front
of me, coming down the screen.

36:25.351 --> 36:28.454
And then, suddenly I saw the
mouse move across the screen,

36:28.487 --> 36:31.557
right-click the "LAN" icon,
and choose "disconnect,"

36:31.590 --> 36:34.293
and lost the chance to fully
transfer the photo

36:34.326 --> 36:36.262
to my machine.

36:36.295 --> 36:40.232
So it was a eureka moment,
but also, "Ah, they got me."

36:42.734 --> 36:44.770
NARRATOR:
Did Gary McKinnon discover

36:44.803 --> 36:50.409
a NASA image of an alien craft,
or something else?

36:50.442 --> 36:54.546
WOOD: The secrecy associated
with MJ-12, in my judgment,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.982
has permitted us to spend
a huge amount of money...

36:57.015 --> 36:58.650
Trillions of dollars.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.453
My more recent conclusion is
that some of

37:01.487 --> 37:03.322
the trillions of dollars
of money

37:03.355 --> 37:08.427
have been used to take the
technology we have discovered

37:08.460 --> 37:11.363
and build gravity-control
devices that we would see

37:11.397 --> 37:12.898
sometimes as UFOs.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.301
So, if you look in the sky now,

37:15.334 --> 37:17.469
in my opinion,
it's a 50-50 chance

37:17.503 --> 37:18.904
that it's ours, versus theirs.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.442
NARRATOR:
According to Corey Goode,

37:23.475 --> 37:26.945
what Gary McKinnon discovered
in the top secret Pentagon

37:26.978 --> 37:31.583
and NASA files is in line
with his own experiences.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.455
Gary ended up being
the first person

37:36.488 --> 37:39.491
to uncover tangible proof
of these programs

37:39.525 --> 37:41.360
through his hacking.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.963
Interestingly enough,
the information he obtained

37:44.996 --> 37:47.399
on the different types
of spacecraft,

37:47.433 --> 37:49.668
the non-terrestrial officers,

37:49.701 --> 37:52.504
the fleet-to-fleet transfers...

37:52.538 --> 37:56.608
All of this perfectly coincided
with Project Solar Warden.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.580
NARRATOR: Corey claims that
the Majestic-12 documents

38:01.613 --> 38:05.417
from the 1950s,
which reveal that interactions

38:05.451 --> 38:08.487
were taking place
between government officials

38:08.520 --> 38:12.624
and numerous alien species
are accurate as well.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.062
Currently,
in the secret space programs,

38:17.095 --> 38:19.998
we've been dealing with
approximately 60 different

38:20.031 --> 38:23.569
non-terrestrial groups
that have come here,

38:23.602 --> 38:26.438
and some of those groups are
interacting with the governments

38:26.472 --> 38:27.839
of the world right now.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.412
NARRATOR:
If there really are both alien

38:33.445 --> 38:37.449
and human factions operating
throughout our solar system,

38:37.483 --> 38:41.887
how much longer can it be kept
hidden from the public?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.823
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

38:44.856 --> 38:46.958
recent government statements
reveal

38:46.992 --> 38:51.463
that the truth
will soon be disclosed.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.874
NARRATOR: New Delhi, India.

39:02.908 --> 39:06.011
January 2010.

39:06.044 --> 39:09.114
The India space program
announces plans

39:09.147 --> 39:13.084
for their first manned trip
to the Moon.

39:13.118 --> 39:16.555
China, Russia
and the United States

39:16.588 --> 39:19.124
all have similar plans
in the works.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.562
There are also numerous
planned missions to Mars

39:23.595 --> 39:25.564
currently in development

39:25.597 --> 39:28.967
by both private
and public organizations.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.038
In the midst of this new fervor
for space exploration,

39:33.071 --> 39:36.742
on April 7, 2015,

39:36.775 --> 39:39.711
NASA chief scientist,
Ellen Stofan,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.814
makes a bold statement
concerning the discovery

39:42.848 --> 39:45.784
of extraterrestrial life.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.128
I think we're gonna have
strong indications

39:47.152 --> 39:49.821
of life beyond Earth
within a decade.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.023
And I think we're gonna have
definitive evidence

39:52.057 --> 39:53.659
within 20 to 30 years.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.662
When we look at that statement,

39:56.695 --> 39:59.431
and we compare it
with the new lunar

39:59.465 --> 40:01.500
and Martian missions
that are coming up...

40:03.769 --> 40:07.539
we have reason to believe
that we may be getting prepared,

40:07.573 --> 40:11.543
drip by drip, for an open
public acknowledgment

40:11.577 --> 40:14.580
of the reality
of a secret space program

40:14.613 --> 40:15.814
that has been in existence

40:15.847 --> 40:17.949
throughout much
of the 20th century,

40:17.983 --> 40:21.086
and only now is going to be
revealed to us.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.655
WOOD: I don't think MJ-12
is the only thing

40:23.689 --> 40:25.457
that's been kept secret.

40:25.491 --> 40:29.661
And I think the disclosure
process needs to go

40:29.695 --> 40:31.697
way beyond MJ-12,

40:31.730 --> 40:33.899
because it's just a tiny portion

40:33.932 --> 40:37.903
of the secrets that this country
lives in and with.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.906
And my goal is
to find the truth.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.143
I don't care what the truth is,
I want to find the truth.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.046
Once this knowledge
is revealed to us,

40:48.079 --> 40:51.817
it will fundamentally propel us
into a Star Trek age.

40:51.850 --> 40:55.687
Almost overnight, we will
have the ability to travel

40:55.721 --> 40:57.122
throughout our solar system,

40:57.155 --> 40:59.457
perhaps travel outside
our solar system.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.930
We will learn that we are
not alone in the universe.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.800
I can understand that many
will have a problem

41:08.834 --> 41:11.937
believing me,
and all I can say is that

41:11.970 --> 41:15.006
I've had these experiences,
I know them to be true,

41:15.040 --> 41:17.743
and one of these days, this
information will be revealed,

41:17.776 --> 41:19.144
and you will know it to be true.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.184
NARRATOR: Could there really be
a government agency

41:26.217 --> 41:28.954
known as the Majestic-12?

41:28.987 --> 41:30.756
And if so,

41:30.789 --> 41:32.958
is it helping the United States,

41:32.991 --> 41:35.961
in league with other nations,
to pave the way

41:35.994 --> 41:39.264
for future communications
between mankind

41:39.297 --> 41:42.768
and its extraterrestrial
counterparts?

41:42.801 --> 41:46.004
According to numerous
top secret documents,

41:46.037 --> 41:50.642
the answer is a profound "yes."

41:50.676 --> 41:54.212
And the ultimate proof may
very well be waiting for us

41:54.245 --> 41:57.115
when we venture
back to the stars

41:57.148 --> 42:01.720
and begin the next phase
in human evolution...

42:01.753 --> 42:04.856
The colonization
of other planets.
