like the movie?

00:49.516 --> 00:51.518
I mean, I thought
it was pretty good.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.652
- It was okay.

00:55.422 --> 00:59.559
- Yeah, but dinner
was cool though right?

00:59.559 --> 01:03.897
- Salmon was dry but overall
it was filling, I guess.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.805
- Well hey you know, I mean,
money's tight these days.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.574
I'm still trying to
keep you happy though.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.676
- Yeah well, keep trying.

01:18.211 --> 01:21.247
I don't know why you're
taking this route anyway.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.650
Just look, turn down
this street right here.

01:23.650 --> 01:24.484
Right here.
- No.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.418
- Right here.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.619
- Felicia, you know the police.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.421
They be all up and
down that street now,

01:28.421 --> 01:29.622
even at this time of night.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.524
- Look just do it.

God, you never listen to me.

01:33.059 --> 01:37.130
I don't, just drive the way
I tell you to drive alright?

01:39.766 --> 01:43.069
- Okay, but you know
the last thing I need

01:43.069 --> 01:45.472
is another ticket these days.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.286
Okay, it's dark but
the coast seems clear.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.121
- Of course it's clear.

(police sirens blaring)

02:07.727 --> 02:08.895
- [Eric] What?

02:11.798 --> 02:14.033

what did you do, Eric?

something wrong.

(motorcycle engine revving)

- [Operator] 1393,
is there a message?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.654
- Both hands on
the steering wheel.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.488
- Alright.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.159
Just on a date
with my girl, man.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.293
Did I do something wrong?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.395
- I'll ask the questions.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.966
Now, do you know why
I pulled you over?

02:46.966 --> 02:49.402
- Wasn't 'cause I
was speeding, was I?

02:49.402 --> 02:50.236
- Was he?

02:50.236 --> 02:51.104
- [Cop] No.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.840
- Well, it couldn't
be 'cause I'm riding

02:53.840 --> 02:57.744
with a white woman 'cause
she's only half white.

02:59.212 --> 03:02.649
- License, registration,
proof of insurance please.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.151
- Alright well I gotta take my
hands off the steering wheel.

03:05.151 --> 03:05.985
- Slowly.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.957
- Knew I shouldn't
have let you drive.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.893
- It'll probably
just be a warning.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.369
- [Cop] I'll be right back.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.711
- Yo, I just, there's always
policemen on this street.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.712
I know that.

03:34.147 --> 03:38.318
- I knew I shouldn't
have let you drive.

03:38.318 --> 03:42.755
- I'm sure he'll let me off
with a warning, you know.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.561
- I need you to sign this.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.395
- Sign?

03:51.064 --> 03:51.898
What?

04:04.510 --> 04:06.946
I don't even know what I did.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.189
- [Cop] Have a nice day.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.227
- Well what's the
charge, genius?

04:25.632 --> 04:28.234
- Impeding the flow of traffic?

04:30.069 --> 04:31.170
What traffic?

04:35.241 --> 04:36.909
I'm a victim of DWB.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.360
- Well, you just had to
go mess up the night,

04:54.360 --> 04:56.429
didn't you Pointdexter?

04:56.429 --> 04:58.231
- Mess up the night?

04:58.231 --> 04:59.766
Wait a minute.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.935
I'm the one who got pulled
over for driving too slow.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.137
You know what?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.371
I don't usually
pull the race card,

05:05.371 --> 05:06.372
but I don't see
no probable cause

05:06.372 --> 05:08.408
for that cop to be stopping me.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.311
- Oh, let me stop
you right there.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.912
The probable cause
is that you're always

05:12.912 --> 05:15.915
too cautious and conservative,

05:15.915 --> 05:17.784
and we both know
you can't afford

05:17.784 --> 05:20.953
a ticket right now,
Mister Unemployed.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.221
- Well damn.

05:22.221 --> 05:23.289
Why you gotta kick
me when I'm down?

05:23.289 --> 05:24.257
I mean, so what?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.458
I got laid off.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.859
They were cutting back
on jobs, you know.

05:26.859 --> 05:27.960
It's a sign of the times.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.961
Not my performance.
- Yeah.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.763
That was a month ago, Eric.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.131
- Well I'm interviewing.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.534
I mean, I am pretty
positive some things

05:34.534 --> 05:35.968
are gonna pan out, too.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.004
You know I mean, the
economy is turning around

05:38.004 --> 05:40.106
and change is gonna come.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.110
- You're right, Eric.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.479
I think it's time for a change.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.947
- That's what I'm talking 'bout.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.782
Now see I was
thinking redecorating.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.184
You know, reinventing myself.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.652
Changing some paintings.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.588
We gon' get it nice and
grown and sexy in here, huh.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.891
I mean, we both
getting older, right?

05:58.891 --> 06:01.461
- You know, Eric, that's
not exactly the type

06:01.461 --> 06:04.697
of change I was talking about.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.299
- Oh.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.469
- Yeah, we're both
getting older,

06:09.469 --> 06:13.206
and I think it's time
that I cash in my chips

06:13.206 --> 06:17.977
on something a bit
more substantial
before it's too late.

06:20.646 --> 06:24.317
I'm knocking loudly on
the door of 30, Eric.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.454
- I didn't know you
were into gambling.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.822
I mean, I just didn't know.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.057
You never really told me.

06:31.057 --> 06:31.891
What's your game?

06:31.891 --> 06:32.725
Poker?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.227
Blackjack?

06:34.227 --> 06:38.464
- Yeah, Eric, I've gambled
a whole two years on you

06:38.464 --> 06:41.801
and I need to fold
before it's too late.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.604
- You know they say
black folks supposed

06:44.604 --> 06:47.206
to stick together
in times like these?

06:47.206 --> 06:48.941

09:06.512 --> 09:08.915
So, what was your impression?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.485
- Oh, this is a great company.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.319
I know that.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.187
I did a lot of research.

09:15.187 --> 09:19.358
- (laughs) I don't
mean about the company.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.893
I mean, we'll get
around to that.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.727
- Oh.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.630
- I mean about Kim.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.366

Oh, she's nice.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.605
Yeah, very pleasant.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.877
- No, come on, bro.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.546
You know what I'm talking about.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.183
I know.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.619
You're just here for the job.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.858
I just wanna let you know though

09:52.858 --> 09:55.361
that if I hire you, you can't.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.032
You know.

10:00.032 --> 10:00.866
- No, sir, no.

10:00.866 --> 10:01.801
No.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.302
Believe me.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.738
My focus is so far from that.

10:07.173 --> 10:11.510
I don't even advocate, you
know, workplace romance.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.345
- Mhmm.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.280
- [Eric] Yes.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.050
- Anyway, so do
you have a resume?

10:19.018 --> 10:19.919
- Yes, yes.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.622
Here you go.

10:26.425 --> 10:30.262
- Well Eric, you're
already ahead of the game.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.800
Most candidates who
walk through that door

10:34.800 --> 10:37.203
don't even bring a copy
of their resume with 'em.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.605
- Well I like to be prepared.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.841
- Good.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.780
- Yeah girl, he didn't
even call me back.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.415
I wonder why.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.550
Ooh, let me call you back.

10:52.918 --> 10:53.786
Hi.

10:53.786 --> 10:54.754
- Hi.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.188
- Who are you here to see?

10:56.188 --> 10:58.090
- I'm here for an
interview with Mr. Cohen.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.593
- Oh, just as I thought.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.728
Just have a seat and we'll
be right with you shortly.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.563
- Oh thank you, ma'am.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.021
- Alex.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.090
- Eric.

11:34.060 --> 11:34.894
Hey man.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.395
- Hey, hey.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.230
Don't tell me you're here for
the account executive's job.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.899
- Ah, think you just told you.

11:39.899 --> 11:40.866
- Oh wow.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.768
Well hopefully one of us get it.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.036
- There you go.

11:44.036 --> 11:44.870
- Yeah, okay.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.838
Cool cool.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.207
- So, you holding up okay?

11:48.207 --> 11:51.110
- Brother, I got no
other choice, right?

11:51.110 --> 11:52.678
- Yeah, yeah.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.714
We should hang out sometime.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.449
Maybe go get a
drink or something.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.050
You still got my cell number?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.285
- Yeah, yeah.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.786
It's on the old employee
contact list, right?

12:00.786 --> 12:01.687
- There you go.

12:01.687 --> 12:02.521
- Okay, cool.

12:02.521 --> 12:05.291
Well, good luck I guess.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.125
Alright man.

12:06.125 --> 12:06.959
- Take care.

12:06.959 --> 12:07.793
- Alright.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.003
(upbeat music)

12:23.375 --> 12:25.411
- [Man] Is that my L7 relative?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.278
- What up, cuz?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.513
- Aye, shh.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.315
Quit talking like
that over here, nigga.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.783
That's blasphemy.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.818
You'll fuck around and get
your noodles knocked off, man.

12:32.818 --> 12:33.652
- Oh shit.

12:33.652 --> 12:34.487
I forgot where I was.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.688
Man, I'm sorry.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.989
- Man, what you doing
over here anyway?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.324
- I had a job interview
around the corner

12:38.324 --> 12:41.527
so I had to get my sugar fix.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.361
You want one?

12:42.361 --> 12:43.596

12:44.263 --> 12:45.331
Good looking.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.101

12:49.101 --> 12:50.069

12:50.069 --> 12:51.704

12:51.704 --> 12:52.938
Nigga, you out of work?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.340
- Yeah, man.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.709
I mean, the company
downsized and I got laid off.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.111
- Man, that's the
same shit my old slave

12:59.111 --> 13:01.013
told me three years ago.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.350
Fuck it.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.685
Nigga like me just pimp my
unemployment for like 18 months.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.455
When that shit ran out, your
boy started supplementing

13:09.455 --> 13:12.324
his income with, you know,
various business ventures.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.660
You know you tie niggas

13:16.562 --> 13:17.530
- Yeah, I know.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.697
- You gon' be alright though.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.166
You got that college degree.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.367
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.269
You gon' be straight
man but in the meantime,

13:23.269 --> 13:26.772

term loan or something,

13:26.772 --> 13:28.207
you know you can holla at me.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.608
I'm kinda like the hood lender.

13:29.608 --> 13:30.543
You feel me?

13:30.543 --> 13:33.112
- Dontae, you a loan shark, too?

13:35.114 --> 13:36.615
- Call it what you want, nigga,

13:36.615 --> 13:38.250

bread fuck with me.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.451

family discount.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.386
You know what I'm saying?

13:40.386 --> 13:41.353
Half off the interest rates.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.454
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

13:42.454 --> 13:43.455
- [Eric] Yeah.

13:43.455 --> 13:44.757

13:47.159 --> 13:49.094
- Alright well, I'll take
that into consideration.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.296
- For sure, nigga.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.397
Aye and what happened
to that bad bitch

13:51.397 --> 13:52.531

13:52.531 --> 13:53.499
The little light
skinned something, man.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.667
Look like Maria Carey, man.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.702
Me, John John, George, P.

13:56.702 --> 13:58.204
Everybody wanted
to fuck that bitch.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.171
We was looking at her.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.139
You brought her to the barbecue.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.073
Niggas was on that bitch.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.107
I wanted to slam that bitch.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.742
- Well, we broke up, man.

14:03.742 --> 14:04.710
- Oh you broke up with her?

14:04.710 --> 14:05.544
- Yeah.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.745
- Aw shit, that's cool.

14:06.745 --> 14:07.546
You might as well
gon' let your boy take

14:07.546 --> 14:08.781
that for a test drive.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.816
Slide your nigga

14:10.816 --> 14:12.017
Slide me that number, man.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.854
Ain't no fun if blood
can't have none.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.356
You love her, don't you?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.457
I'm just playing with you.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.825
I'm just messing with you.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.293

14:25.431 --> 14:26.699
Okay.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.933

14:29.902 --> 14:31.136

14:31.136 --> 14:32.238
I gotta be in before the
street lights come on.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.038
- I got you, okay.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.006
- But look here.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.541
I got big love for you, E.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.575
- Aye, I love you, too.

14:36.575 --> 14:37.776
- Ever since we was little, man,

14:37.776 --> 14:38.978

14:38.978 --> 14:39.979
You know what I'm saying?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.213
I got love for you, man.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.382
If you need that bread,

14:43.382 --> 14:46.352
if you need some work

14:46.352 --> 14:47.386
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.787
Like you need a nigga laid down.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.556
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.024
Columbian neck tie.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.159
Nigga come through the
ski mask way with the AR.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.327
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

14:55.327 --> 14:56.462
Nigga got silence and shit.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.496
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

14:57.496 --> 14:58.330
Really just do niggas bad.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.598
Glocks, whatever.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.901
Come up to your job.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.502
Oh you ain't got no job.

15:03.502 --> 15:04.970
- I'm cool.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.205
- But when you get a job if you
need me to, I come up there.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.506
- Yeah nah I'm good.

15:07.506 --> 15:08.507
I'm good, D.

15:08.507 --> 15:09.341
- [Dontae] For sure.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.175
Holla at me.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.176
- Thanks though.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.645
Alright.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.546
- Tell Auntie Jackie
I said what's up.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.048
- [Eric] Okay.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.350
- Aye, you know I do that
plumbing too, my nigga.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.418
- Cool, D.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.352
- For sure.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.921
(upbeat music)

15:28.727 --> 15:30.796
- What took yo ass so long?

15:30.796 --> 15:32.398
- You didn't go stop
off and get some dong

15:32.398 --> 15:35.167
from one of your ratty
ass clients, did you?

15:35.167 --> 15:38.103
- Man, you always gotta
say some stupid shit, man.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.772
I stopped and hollered
at my cousin Eric, man.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.407
That nigga was at the store.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.243
- That bougie ass negro
in this neighborhood?

15:44.243 --> 15:45.177
Yeah right.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.846
- Man, that's what I'm saying.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.715
Nigga say he was just pushing
through real quick though

15:49.715 --> 15:52.151
on the way back from a little
job interview or something.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.886
- Oh really?

15:53.886 --> 15:57.256
Then maybe you can learn
something from him.

15:57.256 --> 16:00.459
- Oh, you upwardly
mobile motherfucker.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.662
It's funny but some
kinda way the bills

16:03.662 --> 16:06.031
stay getting paid 'round
this motherfucker.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.301
You ain't never
seen no red notice.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.636
- I guess.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.937
- I guess.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.305
And I guess you
ain't got no problem

16:13.305 --> 16:15.074
smoking my
motherfucking good shit.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.842
Girl you better stay
out my stash, man.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.078
That's my good shit, man.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.512
- And if I don't?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.819
- Let me hit something.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.721
You should let me hit something.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.289
- Sorry bruh.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.957
You gotta get your own.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.459
- Aint' that a bitch.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.293
- Sure is.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.463
I'm just playing.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.697
Here babe.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.099
- You better act
right 'round this.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.433
- Whatever fool.

16:42.935 --> 16:43.769
- Shit.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.703
- Hurry up.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.606
Shit.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.475
Blow that shit out.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.176
- Look, look, check this out.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.978
You know what?

16:52.978 --> 16:55.547
Speaking of blowing,
I had seen this video

16:55.547 --> 16:58.016
on the internet earlier
where it looked like

16:58.016 --> 16:59.551
a little two fisted
flute technique.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.286
Didn't you tell me
you played something?

17:01.286 --> 17:02.688
What you played in high school?

17:02.688 --> 17:03.789
- Are you kidding me?

17:03.789 --> 17:04.690
- I'm just saying.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.924
Just gon' hook me up.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.160
Let's take it to the
bathroom for a minute.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.363
- Nigga, you crazy (laughs),

17:11.363 --> 17:15.100
but I guess since I'm
in a good mood you know.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.635
I might could hook you up.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.170
- Yeah and after that you
can hook up that cornbread

17:18.170 --> 17:20.005
with that milk I
just brought back.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.807
Get yo ass up and
cook something.

17:21.807 --> 17:22.708
Hurry up.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.343
- I guess, for sure.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.146
But could you pass me
that blunt back though?

17:27.146 --> 17:29.415
- [Dontae] Pass these nuts.

17:32.951 --> 17:35.521
(bright music)

17:40.359 --> 17:44.430
- So Kim, tell me a little
more about yourself.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.332
- What else is
there to know, Gary?

17:50.235 --> 17:54.573
- How 'bout what else do
you like to do besides eat?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.310
- Well, let's see.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.446
I like to travel and shop.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.316
- Shop.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.887
Okay, is that it?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.156
- Yup, pretty much.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.624
- Excuse me.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.459
Yes.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.594
- Yes, how can I help you?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.062
- Yes, I like to order
something to go, please.

18:17.062 --> 18:17.930
- Let me get you
the desert menu.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.364
- Oh no.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.533
I'd like to order the
jambalaya with extra shrimp

18:21.533 --> 18:24.369
and a side of
macaroni and cheese.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.473
- Would you like some
cornbread with that?

18:27.473 --> 18:28.874
It's $1.50 extra.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.008
- Yeah, that sounds good.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.276
Three of those.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.211
Four, four.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.548
- Can I get anything
for you, sir?

18:36.548 --> 18:37.549
- No, thank you.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.485
Just the check, please.

18:43.755 --> 18:45.023
Damn, Kim.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.459
So you've obviously come
out very hungry tonight.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.229
You planning on having a late
night snack or something?

18:50.229 --> 18:52.764
- No, lunch for tomorrow.

18:52.764 --> 18:53.599
- Lunch?

18:57.069 --> 18:57.936
Okay.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.104
- Here you go.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.809
- [Kim] So where we going next?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.210
Movies?

19:05.210 --> 19:06.111
Show?

19:06.111 --> 19:06.945
- Damn.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.818
We going half on this?

19:13.852 --> 19:16.889
- [Kim] We going whole on you.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.124
- How 'bout hole up in you.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.447
- Everything okay, baby?

19:43.916 --> 19:44.750
- Yeah.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.588
I'm gonna go home now.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.958
- You don't have to go.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.795
You can stay the
night if you want.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.333
- That's okay.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.722
(soft music)

21:00.192 --> 21:01.326
- What's wrong?

21:04.696 --> 21:07.466
- This situation
is what's wrong.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.636
- What do you mean?

21:11.837 --> 21:14.673
- I can't go on just
being a booty call.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.075
- What are you talking about?

21:18.276 --> 21:22.547
- Alex, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.882
You've only taken me out twice

21:23.882 --> 21:26.218
since the first time we met.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.757
- Well you know, money's
a little tight these days.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.192
- It doesn't have to be much.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.295
An occasional movie night.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.431
A walk on the beach.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.265
Something.

21:41.933 --> 21:45.937
Why haven't I met any
of your friends yet?

21:45.937 --> 21:48.106
- I don't have many friends.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.641
- Liar, liar, liar.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.478
Alex, I'm done.

21:56.748 --> 22:01.653
I'm more than a piece of ass
and I'm done settling for less.

22:02.788 --> 22:04.056
Goodnight Alex.

22:13.398 --> 22:17.903
- Well, guess a new spot on
the roster just opened up.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.219
Damn.

22:34.219 --> 22:38.090
I gotta clean my bathroom
every time a woman comes over.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.558
Look at this.

22:39.558 --> 22:44.129
They act like they can't never
come in the damn bathroom

22:44.129 --> 22:46.298
without leaving their DNA.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.133
Shit.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.472
Lipstick on the tissue paper.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.478
A player's work is never done.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.947
(bright music)

23:08.620 --> 23:10.188
- [Eric] Hey man,
you know what sucks?

23:10.188 --> 23:14.593
Neither of us got that
job we interviewed for.

23:14.593 --> 23:15.894
- [Alex] Yeah, that
would've been nice

23:15.894 --> 23:17.229
to work under that chick Kim.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.063
You feel me?

23:18.063 --> 23:19.564
- [Eric] Oh yeah.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.401
Ah yes, she was cute in a
mature kinda way, you know.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.138
Man you know, I hope we
at least get a callback

23:26.138 --> 23:28.039
from one of those
employers in there.

23:28.039 --> 23:31.209
I must've put in 20
resumes this time.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.650
- I don't know 'bout these
ole job fairs anyway.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.987
Sometimes they can
be a waste of time,

23:41.987 --> 23:44.956
but I appreciate you putting
me on though, you know.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.124
- Oh yeah, no problem man.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.626
No problem.

23:47.626 --> 23:51.530
I mean, one can only hope
for so much, you know yeah.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.566
Like three months severance
pay and unemployment,

23:54.566 --> 23:57.135
that's only gonna take
you so far, right?

23:57.135 --> 23:58.937
- Three months?

23:58.937 --> 23:59.771
- Yeah.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.206
- You got three months?

24:01.206 --> 24:02.140
- Yeah, didn't you?

24:02.140 --> 24:04.276
- Nah, they only gave me two.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.710
Rat bastards.

24:05.710 --> 24:06.545
- Damn.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.581
Well I'm sure it's because
you know I probably

24:09.581 --> 24:12.117
worked there a little
bit before you.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.219
Yeah, that's what it was.

24:18.256 --> 24:21.293
- Say you still seeing that
little light skinned honey dip

24:21.293 --> 24:24.963
you brought to the
Christmas party last year?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.632
- Nah man, we broke up recently.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.602
- Dang.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.271
Ooh, that was a bad broad there.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.576
- Yeah thanks.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.246
- It's for the best anyway.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.582
Relationships too expensive.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.885
- Dating ain't any cheaper.

24:46.885 --> 24:47.953
- You kidding me?

24:47.953 --> 24:49.054
- Nah, I mean.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.655
- Let me tell you something.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.190
You need to get
back out there more.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.391
- Ah man, come on.

24:53.391 --> 24:56.661
- I mean I can tell
you all hurt up inside.

24:56.661 --> 25:00.298
Could see it coming
out of your pores.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.233
- What?

25:01.233 --> 25:02.167
Really?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.401
- Yeah, you need to date more.

25:03.401 --> 25:06.271
See new booty will
dry those tears.

25:07.405 --> 25:08.807
Get out there and
date and the first key

25:08.807 --> 25:11.476
to dating is to be creative.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.044
You see creativity will help you

25:13.044 --> 25:15.280
supplement excessive spending.

25:15.280 --> 25:20.285
Now unemployed or not, we never
wanna waste time or money.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.020
- So how do I do that, man?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.255
I mean, be creative?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.422
- Well, you start
by talking to every

25:24.422 --> 25:25.790
fine woman that you see.

25:25.790 --> 25:26.992
- Aw man.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.693
- Then you have little
icebreaker dates.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.862
Starbucks, beaches, parks,

25:32.130 --> 25:35.767
and any other local
cost or free shit.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.068
See you never
wanna get caught up

25:37.068 --> 25:39.437
spending $50 or $60 on some date

25:39.437 --> 25:41.773
that's not gonna lead
to you hitting it.

25:41.773 --> 25:42.607
Trust me.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.345
- Damn, Alex.

25:47.345 --> 25:49.648
I never knew you was
such a lady killer.

25:49.648 --> 25:54.052
- Unfortunately we can't write
bad dates off on our taxes.

25:54.052 --> 25:58.490
We gotta make sure we get
the most bang for our buck.

25:59.524 --> 26:00.959
- Yeah, I got you.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.163
- And you smoke out any
girls that's not putting out.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.865
No problem.

26:06.865 --> 26:09.234
And even then once
you do get 'em in bed,

26:09.234 --> 26:10.936
then you wanna make sure
that you never spend

26:10.936 --> 26:13.371
more than $40 on a date?

26:13.371 --> 26:15.707
Anything more is ridiculous.

26:17.475 --> 26:18.877
- Okay.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.313
No, I mean thanks for
the information, man.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.781
- Yeah, no problem.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.116
Brother, it's war out there.

26:27.018 --> 26:27.852
- War?

26:31.790 --> 26:34.426
- Say, I feel like
getting a bite.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.361
You wanna get something to eat?

26:36.361 --> 26:37.195
- Yeah.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.029
Nah I'm hungry.

26:38.029 --> 26:38.863
Yeah, let's do it.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.698
- Yeah, let's go.

26:39.698 --> 26:40.632
There's a spot up there.

26:40.632 --> 26:41.466
- Okay.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.502
War.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.872
- [Alex] It's war, brother.

26:49.641 --> 26:50.442
- [Kim] So what are
you gonna be doing

26:50.442 --> 26:51.776
on your free weekend?

26:51.776 --> 26:54.846
- Girl, I'm just happy
to be child free.

26:54.846 --> 26:57.282
I think I might just relax.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.517
- No hot dates on the books?

26:59.517 --> 27:01.586
- With kids, dating is hard.

27:01.586 --> 27:04.956
The caliber of men that I
like just don't want a woman

27:04.956 --> 27:07.292
with two kids in the
twilight of her life.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.461
On that note, I shall sip.

27:11.229 --> 27:14.566
- Deborah, you are way too hard
on yourself, girl, for real.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.935
- Ask me would I
trade places with you.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.403
Wait a minute.
- Alright.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.038
- Ask me after about
two more of these

27:20.038 --> 27:21.673
and I'll give you
an honest answer.

27:21.673 --> 27:24.542
- (laughs) Girl, I don't
think you'd wanna trade places

27:24.542 --> 27:27.312
with my $32,000 a year
making ass anyway.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.814
- On that note, I shall drink.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.984
- Remember my boss is a Jew.

27:34.185 --> 27:36.788
- What about your
dating prospects?

27:36.788 --> 27:39.824
- Oh I've been dating a lot
but see my primary purpose

27:39.824 --> 27:42.627
for dating right now is
to supplement my income.

27:42.627 --> 27:43.728
- [Deborah] What?

27:43.728 --> 27:44.929
- Oh, now hold on.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.831
I got my dude that
I'm cool with.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.299
We're not committed or anything,

27:48.299 --> 27:49.701
but we get together when I need

27:49.701 --> 27:51.202
to give me a little
peace, you know.

27:51.202 --> 27:54.773
Now the rest of the guys,
that's where I get my free meals

27:54.773 --> 27:56.875
and my entertainment off of.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.510
- Don't you think that's
kind of scandalous?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.577
- Not at all.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.348
Chile, I ain't forcing none
of these guys to take me out.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.484
If they gon' ask me, then
shoot I'ma take a free date.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.319
It's kinda fun actually.

28:08.319 --> 28:09.754
- Oh, I supposed you can do that

28:09.754 --> 28:11.689
sort of thing when
you're single.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.992
- Well, think
about it like this.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.428
If I'm going out at
least three times a week,

28:16.428 --> 28:19.764
how much you think I'm saving
on my grocery bill, girl?

28:19.764 --> 28:21.499
Shoot now you know
how hard it is

28:21.499 --> 28:23.401
for a sister these days.

28:23.401 --> 28:25.970
- I see your point
but what do you do

28:25.970 --> 28:27.906
when they wanna get some?

28:27.906 --> 28:29.507
- That's when they get cut off.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.576
- At least you're dating.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.579
Most of the men I go out with,

28:34.579 --> 28:38.149
once they find out I have two
kids, they don't call anymore,

28:38.149 --> 28:40.051
but I can't say that I blame 'em

28:40.051 --> 28:42.187
because if they really
got it going on,

28:42.187 --> 28:45.023
why would they wanna be
bothered with my baggage?

28:45.023 --> 28:47.726
- Girl, now you got
this nice house,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.662
you got a good
job and your kids.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.730
All you really need
is a decent brother

28:52.730 --> 28:56.201
to come and service your
account from time to time.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.836
(laughing)

28:57.836 --> 28:59.637
- I suppose you're right.

28:59.637 --> 29:01.339
- I've done the marriage thing.

29:01.339 --> 29:03.875
Now it's time for
it to be about me.

29:03.875 --> 29:04.709
- Yes.

29:04.709 --> 29:05.810
That's right.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.214
- [Alex] You see, the
Promenade is the perfect place

29:09.214 --> 29:10.849
to troll for broads.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.451
- Now are we only
looking for black women?

29:13.451 --> 29:14.686
- Nah, nah.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.287
See you talk to every
fine woman you see.

29:16.287 --> 29:20.992
Black women, white women,
Asian women, Latino women.

29:20.992 --> 29:22.494
- Hey.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.163
- The goal is to conquer all
four corners of the earth.

29:25.163 --> 29:25.997
- Yeah.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.401
- Ooh, I'd like to hit that.

29:30.401 --> 29:33.037
- Now see man, I only
dated black women

29:33.037 --> 29:34.973
so I wouldn't know what
to say to the others.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.541
- You say the same
things to others

29:36.541 --> 29:38.009
as you say to black women.

29:38.009 --> 29:40.812
See the good thing is the
others generally turn you down

29:40.812 --> 29:44.582
with more dignity and
tact and less attitude.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.922
Oh, take note.

29:50.922 --> 29:52.557
Take note.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.591
Excuse me.

29:53.591 --> 29:54.926
Excuse me.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.194
Hey, how you doing?

29:56.194 --> 29:57.529
- [Woman] I'm fine, thank you.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.197
- Good, nice colors.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.434
- [Woman] Yeah, we match.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.837
- Yeah and maybe meant to be.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.407
- (laughs) Maybe.

30:09.407 --> 30:10.642
- I know you shopping
and everything.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.377
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

30:12.377 --> 30:13.545
Hi, my name's Alex.

30:13.545 --> 30:14.445
- Hi, Alex.

30:14.445 --> 30:15.313
I'm Kate.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.481
Nice to meet you.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.750
- As in Jackson right?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.118
- That's right.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.887
- My favorite
angel of Charlie's.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.890
- I'm impressed.

30:29.394 --> 30:31.429
You have a nice smile.

30:31.429 --> 30:32.864
- Well thank you.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.568
- I'm really sorry
but I gotta go.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.803
My parking meter's
gonna run out.

30:38.803 --> 30:39.771
- Oh yeah yeah.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.306
They don't play out here.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.775
- No, but we can keep in
contact if you'd like to.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.109
If you can save
my number quickly.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.110
- Absolutely.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.745
- It's 213-545-7777.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.182
- [Alex] Got it.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.016
- Call me.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.318
- Alright, Kate.

31:02.093 --> 31:02.927
- Nah.

31:04.429 --> 31:05.830
Nah man, come on.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.166
Tell me you didn't
get the number.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.935
- Then I would be lying
to you, my friend.

31:10.935 --> 31:11.769
- Aw man.

31:13.137 --> 31:17.108
- You see, everyone gets turned
down, but the great ones,

31:17.108 --> 31:20.111
they never expect
to be turned down.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.447
- Ah.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.850
Hope it happens to me soon.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.218
- Ah, in due time.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.219
In due time.

31:29.687 --> 31:32.323
But for now, let's
see what's happening

31:32.323 --> 31:34.192
with these sisters out here.

31:34.192 --> 31:35.460
- Yeah.

31:35.460 --> 31:39.297
- This episode might be
a bit more predictable.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.066
Let's go.

31:42.066 --> 31:42.934
- Alright.

31:42.934 --> 31:45.503
(upbeat music)

32:15.900 --> 32:17.135
- [Alex] Oh, here's one.

32:17.135 --> 32:17.669
Here's one, here's
one, here's one.

32:17.669 --> 32:18.803
- Yeah?

32:18.803 --> 32:19.871
- [Alex] Be confident,
be confident.

32:19.871 --> 32:20.872
_ I got you.

32:22.206 --> 32:23.341
- Hey, excuse me.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.175
How you doing?

32:24.175 --> 32:25.777
My name is Eric.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.611
I was...

32:29.013 --> 32:31.082
A nice dog you got there.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.021
- [Alex] Oh, oh.

32:37.021 --> 32:37.889
Check this out, man.

32:37.889 --> 32:38.823
Check this.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.193
Yeah, yeah, I like this.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.227
Hey, how you doing?

32:43.227 --> 32:44.462
- I'm cool.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.763
- Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

32:45.763 --> 32:49.100
- Sure, but you'll
be wasting your time.

32:52.003 --> 32:56.140
- Very, very uncalled for
but it proves my theory.

32:58.209 --> 32:59.610
- Yeah, well we're gonna
meet a cool sister.

32:59.610 --> 33:00.778
I'm confident about that.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.213
- Oh yeah, they're out here.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.549
Just few and far in-between.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.186
I mean they say the same
thing about us, too, you know.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.520
- But at least we
give them the chance

33:09.520 --> 33:12.924
to find out that we
ain't about shit.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.526
- Yeah, you got a point.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.061
What about Christian women?

33:17.061 --> 33:17.895
- What about them?

33:17.895 --> 33:19.430
They have sex, too.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.365
- I know that.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.566
I'm just saying, you know.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.167
Maybe they might
be nicer, you know.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.769
Easier to approach.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.839
- Yeah, maybe.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.575
I mean, some of
the biggest freaks

33:30.575 --> 33:32.844
I know are Christian women.

33:33.978 --> 33:37.648
I do need to get
back in the church.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.918
Yeah, let me let that
thought marinate.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.824
- Yeah, you let that
marinate like steak.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.427
(upbeat music)

33:58.269 --> 34:01.105
(knocking on door)

34:10.681 --> 34:11.849
- Lil' Pimpin'.

34:11.849 --> 34:12.683
- [Lil' Pimpin']
What's happening, man?

34:12.683 --> 34:13.518
- What's happening, boy?

34:13.518 --> 34:14.752
- You know how it is.

34:14.752 --> 34:15.553
Me and my girl need
us a little something

34:15.553 --> 34:16.988
to get us by that's all.

34:16.988 --> 34:18.556
- Okay, hold on dog.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.590
You know I got you.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.692
- [Lil' Pimpin'] Oh okay.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.128
- Trina, go in the bedroom
and put on some clothes

34:24.128 --> 34:26.297
or something 'til I finish.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.765
- Alright, for sure.

34:27.765 --> 34:29.167
- You know Lil' Pimpin'

34:29.167 --> 34:32.570
I don't want him
looking at you and shit.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.174

34:38.576 --> 34:39.410
- What's happening?

34:39.410 --> 34:40.678
- Oh not much, man.

34:40.678 --> 34:41.946
I see you got your nice
little Superfly hookup.

34:41.946 --> 34:42.880

Yeah good looking.

36:41.799 --> 36:43.601

Take the game to the
whole nother level

36:45.336 --> 36:46.270
with one of these, man.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.104
You said one?

36:47.104 --> 36:48.406
- All you need is one.

36:48.406 --> 36:49.807
Your girl gon' be
walking bowlegged

36:49.807 --> 36:51.309
and pigeon toes like mine.

36:51.309 --> 36:52.243
- [Lil' Pimpin'] Say what?

36:52.243 --> 36:53.511
- Yeah.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.112
- [Lil' Pimpin'] Oh, so
that's why she jumped up

36:55.112 --> 36:56.614
out the sofa okay.

36:56.614 --> 36:57.648
- [Dontae] This bitch walking
around like she constipated.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.116
They call me Mister X-lax.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.318
- [Lil' Pimpin'] Oh stop it.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.519
My man.

37:01.519 --> 37:02.453
- [Dontae] You know
what I'm talking about?

37:02.453 --> 37:03.654
Better check that oil, pimp.

37:03.654 --> 37:04.855
- [Lil' Pimpin']
Good looking, homie.

37:04.855 --> 37:05.790
- [Dontae] Hey fuck
with me though.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.225
You know what I'm saying?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.726
On my next week, I'm supposed
to have some good, man.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.927
You know my white boy from
Hermosa Beach got some ugh.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.395
- [Lil' Pimpin']
I'm with that, man.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.196
I'll holla at you when
you get off that bracket.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.764
- For sure, my nigga.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.734
Trina.

37:23.507 --> 37:26.077
- Oh, what you got
in your pocket?

37:26.077 --> 37:30.681
- Oh, that ain't nothing but
a little cheese (laughs).

37:30.681 --> 37:31.515
- Wrong.

37:31.515 --> 37:32.516
It's dinner.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.654
- I thought you
was cooking though.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.923
- I changed my mind.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.057
- Oh like that?

37:40.057 --> 37:41.826
- Yeah, I deserve it.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.527
What?

37:43.527 --> 37:44.562
- How you figure?

37:44.562 --> 37:46.163
- 'Cause I feed you, I fuck you,

37:46.163 --> 37:50.167
and I don't fuck with you
so two three equals four.

37:50.167 --> 37:51.135
What?

37:51.135 --> 37:52.336
- Whatever, man.

37:52.336 --> 37:53.504
Check this out.

37:53.504 --> 37:54.672
You gon' cook?

37:54.672 --> 37:55.806
- You know what?

37:55.806 --> 37:57.375
I think you just
getting too comfortable

37:57.375 --> 38:01.178
'cause I moved in here
after a month of dating

38:01.178 --> 38:02.880
and you got the coochie
on the first night

38:02.880 --> 38:05.249
so you just slipping
now like you--

38:05.249 --> 38:06.250
- Look, look, baby.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.518
How long we been dating?

38:07.518 --> 38:08.886
Trina, how long we
been dating, baby?

38:08.886 --> 38:10.421
- What you mean?

38:10.421 --> 38:13.791
We been fucking around for
what like three months now

38:13.791 --> 38:15.660
and yes I said it fucking around

38:15.660 --> 38:18.195
'cause we ain't
dated for shit, okay.

38:18.195 --> 38:20.765
And if we gon' start dating,
we gotta start doing the things

38:20.765 --> 38:23.334
that people that date do, okay.

38:24.201 --> 38:25.469
- You know you always tripping

38:25.469 --> 38:27.471
with your little black
woman neck and shit.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.674
Baby, you know I take you to
the movies and shit but damn.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.609
What the fuck a nigga gon'
spend all that bread for

38:31.609 --> 38:33.978
when I get all the bootlegs
before they hit the theater.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.913
- Dontae, a little effort.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.048
That's all I'm asking.

38:37.048 --> 38:37.882
A little effort.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.116
Can you do that for me?

38:39.116 --> 38:41.118
Is that too much to ask?

38:46.323 --> 38:47.558
- Nah, nah.

38:47.558 --> 38:49.727
For you, nah, nah,
nah, never, nah.

38:49.727 --> 38:50.961
Nah, baby.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.663
You know I got you.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.699
- Yeah you got me but
you need to figure out

38:54.699 --> 38:56.367
how to keep me okay.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.305
- Trina, Trina, look, look.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.141
For real, baby.

39:04.141 --> 39:05.676
Don't be like that, man.

39:05.676 --> 39:06.510
Come on.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.080
What restaurant you wanna go to?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.781
Where you wanna eat at?

39:10.781 --> 39:12.116
Wherever you wanna go.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.751
- For real?

39:13.751 --> 39:15.052
- Yeah.

39:15.052 --> 39:17.421
- Whatever place I wanna go to?

39:17.421 --> 39:18.989
- That's what I said, baby.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.158
- I wanna go to Hometown Buffet.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.960
- Ooh, ooh, that's
what I'm talking 'bout.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.995
They got them bomb
ass mashed potatoes.

39:24.995 --> 39:27.064
- And it's rib Wednesday.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.535
(glasses clattering)

39:31.535 --> 39:34.138
(bright music)

39:46.884 --> 39:49.420
- Bernard, I just
wanted to let you know

39:49.420 --> 39:52.189
that I was divided about
asking you over tonight

39:52.189 --> 39:54.091
because I don't really know you.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.260
It probably goes against
my better judgment,

39:56.260 --> 39:59.797
but I guess you have to
live a little, right.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.365
- I'm harmless.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.466
- So you say.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.936
I'm new to the dating
game, you know.

40:05.936 --> 40:08.139
After being married
for six years,

40:08.139 --> 40:10.141
I'm a little rusty
with all this stuff.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.810
- Well, I'm here to help you
work out all of the kinks.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.111
- Like I said on the phone,

40:14.111 --> 40:17.181
there'll be no
hanky panky, mister.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.649
- Alright, okay.

40:18.649 --> 40:20.417
I'm cool with that.

40:20.417 --> 40:21.652
- I'm serious.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.421
We have to get to
know each first.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.389
Plus, I have two
kids to worry about.

40:25.389 --> 40:26.991
- And where are the
kids, by the way?

40:26.991 --> 40:28.392
- They're with my
mother for the weekend.

40:28.392 --> 40:29.960
- And you do trust
your mother, right?

40:29.960 --> 40:31.462
- Of course.

40:31.462 --> 40:33.364
- Then you don't have to
worry about the kids then.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.200
- Look, you know
exactly what I mean,

40:36.200 --> 40:38.402
so let's not even go there.

40:40.304 --> 40:41.705
How 'bout some wine to break up

40:41.705 --> 40:44.108
this monotonous conversation?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.576
- Sure.

40:45.576 --> 40:46.811
I hope you like red
because that's all I have.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.045
- Red is fine.

40:48.045 --> 40:49.346
- Well, unless you
wanna go to the store.

40:49.346 --> 40:50.414
We can get something else.

40:50.414 --> 40:51.816
- No, no, red will suffice.

40:51.816 --> 40:53.784
- Okay, usually I
have white as well,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.319
but I tend to buy more red

40:55.319 --> 40:58.522
because sometimes I like to
have a drink after a meal.

40:58.522 --> 41:02.359
My girl, Kim, she likes
Merlot as she calls it.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.997
You probably don't even
drink wine, do you?

41:06.997 --> 41:10.267
What do you like to drink
when you get your sip on?

41:10.267 --> 41:12.336
Some of that yak?

41:12.336 --> 41:15.206
Isn't it funny how so many
black men like Hennessy.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.974
Black men ought to buy stock in

41:16.974 --> 41:19.376
that company don't you think?

41:21.579 --> 41:23.948
That wasn't funny, huh?

41:23.948 --> 41:25.649
- Just pour the wine, please.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.484
- Oh okay.

41:29.887 --> 41:30.888
One for you.

41:34.625 --> 41:35.893
And one for me.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.803
How about a toast?

41:45.803 --> 41:47.872
Here's to moving forward.

41:51.141 --> 41:52.543
- Let's hope so.

41:52.543 --> 41:53.911
- Stop it, silly.

42:05.856 --> 42:06.690
- Deborah.

42:08.726 --> 42:12.196
If it's your goal to
never be intimate with me,

42:12.196 --> 42:13.931
then you're doing a
pretty damn good job

42:13.931 --> 42:15.966
at accomplishing that.

42:15.966 --> 42:17.701
- Why would I ever want that?

42:17.701 --> 42:18.602
I love sex.

42:19.837 --> 42:22.473
- Well right about now I don't.

42:22.473 --> 42:23.307
- Oh.

42:26.577 --> 42:29.179
(upbeat music)

43:34.645 --> 43:37.581
(doorbell ringing)

43:38.749 --> 43:41.151
(slow music)

43:44.555 --> 43:45.489
- [Alex] Hey there.

43:45.489 --> 43:46.357
- Hi, how are you?

43:46.357 --> 43:47.291
- I'm good.

43:48.425 --> 43:49.326
Come on in.

43:53.931 --> 43:57.034
- I just wanted to
apologize for being late.

43:57.034 --> 43:59.636
- That's mighty black of you.

43:59.636 --> 44:00.938
- [Kate] I'm sorry?

44:00.938 --> 44:02.106
- Nothing.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.874
It's just a saying.

44:03.874 --> 44:06.276
You know what I'm saying?

44:06.276 --> 44:07.111
- No.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.792
You have a really
nice place here.

44:21.792 --> 44:23.894
- Why thank you, my dear.

44:26.330 --> 44:30.567
- Hi, can I take your
coat and your purse?

44:30.567 --> 44:32.803
- [Kate] Why sure.

44:32.803 --> 44:34.638
How hospitable of you.

44:38.342 --> 44:43.280
I don't usually go to the
guy's house on the first date.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.683
- And that would be
mighty un-white of you.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.285
- [Kate] I'm sorry?

44:49.286 --> 44:50.120
- Nothing.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.256
Have a seat.

44:52.256 --> 44:53.857
- [Kate] Thank you.

44:59.663 --> 45:01.698
- Can I get you
something to drink?

45:01.698 --> 45:02.533
- Sure.

45:04.268 --> 45:07.104
How 'bout a little
Henny and Coke?

45:08.839 --> 45:10.908
- You're kidding, right?

45:10.908 --> 45:12.209
- Oh no, absolutely not.

45:12.209 --> 45:16.847
It's my top choice when
I wanna get my drank on.

45:16.847 --> 45:19.016
- You've got to be joking.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.785
Are you perpetuating
the stereotype

45:21.785 --> 45:24.188
that all black men love Cognac?

45:24.188 --> 45:25.589
- Oh heavens no.

45:25.589 --> 45:28.292
I wouldn't make fun
of the black race.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.027
I would never do that.

45:30.027 --> 45:32.529
I just really like that drink.

45:34.031 --> 45:37.968
- And how do you even
know that I have some?

45:37.968 --> 45:39.136
- Well do you?

45:42.573 --> 45:46.944
- Yes, I do but it's
not because I'm black.

45:46.944 --> 45:51.115
It's because I just so
happened to like the drink.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.087
Okay yeah.

45:58.255 --> 46:01.725
Do you want that on
the rocks or straight?

46:01.725 --> 46:03.727
- Straight please.

46:03.727 --> 46:05.162
- [Alex] Got you.

46:10.033 --> 46:12.069
- I just love your
African artwork.

46:12.069 --> 46:13.070
- Thank you.

46:13.070 --> 46:15.205
I'm glad to see that you are

46:15.205 --> 46:17.841
so open-minded
about black culture.

46:17.841 --> 46:21.245
- Oh it's second nature for me.

46:21.245 --> 46:22.246
- Oh really?

46:24.748 --> 46:28.318
Well, you know, you're
the first white girl

46:31.889 --> 46:33.991
that I've ever hung with.

46:34.892 --> 46:36.794
- You've got to be kidding.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.128
- No, it's true.

46:39.530 --> 46:43.133
Am I the first black guy
that you've ever hung with?

46:43.133 --> 46:44.635
- Hell to the nah.

46:49.973 --> 46:53.877
- Well, how many have
you hung out with before?

46:55.179 --> 46:57.114
Two, three, maybe four?

46:59.516 --> 47:02.386
- Alex, I've only
dated black guys.

47:03.954 --> 47:07.891
- So you haven't even
seen your own kind naked?

47:15.966 --> 47:17.134
Black man any.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.339
What do you call this?

47:23.507 --> 47:25.509
- Are you talking
about your dick?

47:25.509 --> 47:27.911
- Real white women say cock.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.447
- Oh, so I'm not
a real woman now?

47:30.447 --> 47:31.648
- Oh no.

47:31.648 --> 47:35.619
Well not the black
girl ghetto neck roll.

47:35.619 --> 47:38.088
Do you say fellatio or head?

47:38.088 --> 47:39.556
- Head.

47:39.556 --> 47:40.457
- Do you swallow?

47:40.457 --> 47:41.391
- Hell no.

47:41.391 --> 47:42.192
- What's your credit score?

47:42.192 --> 47:43.026
- 645.

47:45.028 --> 47:46.296
- Oh no, oh no.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.700
Kate, you got to go.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.405
You got black girl
attitude and tendencies.

47:55.405 --> 47:56.406
- Whoa, whoa.

47:56.406 --> 47:58.342
What is going on?

47:58.342 --> 48:01.645
I thought you liked me 'cause
I'm down with the brothers.

48:01.645 --> 48:02.646
- [Alex] No.

48:03.814 --> 48:07.017
Kate, you have messed up
my white girl fantasy.

48:07.017 --> 48:08.185
You got to go.

48:10.854 --> 48:11.922
Good evening.

48:14.524 --> 48:15.359
No.

48:26.436 --> 48:27.371
Oh my gosh.

48:36.513 --> 48:39.082
(bright music)

48:41.518 --> 48:45.455
- Man, I just can't believe
we're standing outside a church

48:45.455 --> 48:47.958
waiting to pick up women, man.

48:47.958 --> 48:49.693
- It was your idea
and I'm beginning

48:49.693 --> 48:52.095
to think it was a good one.

48:52.095 --> 48:54.231
See, it's like a
virtual nightclub

48:54.231 --> 48:58.368
minus all of the pretentious
attention seeking women.

48:58.368 --> 49:00.937
- Yeah it might've been
a good idea in theory,

49:00.937 --> 49:03.607
but now we're actually doing,
man, I feel like I'm amongst

49:03.607 --> 49:05.475
the bottomless
society or something.

49:05.475 --> 49:06.910
Man, we could've at
least had the decency

49:06.910 --> 49:08.979
to go inside and
fake it, you know.

49:08.979 --> 49:10.447
Attend service or something.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.083
We could've both used the
blessings I'll tell you that.

49:13.083 --> 49:16.820
- If you want, we could
both bow our heads

49:16.820 --> 49:19.957
and pray for beautiful,
Christian women

49:19.957 --> 49:21.692
to fall into our laps.

49:21.692 --> 49:23.226
- Ha ha ha.

49:23.226 --> 49:24.661
Man, I'm serious.

49:24.661 --> 49:25.896
Who knows?

49:25.896 --> 49:27.731
Maybe if I join a
new church home,

49:27.731 --> 49:29.900
my luck would turn around.

49:31.968 --> 49:36.440
- I don't mean to rain on your
spiritual parade right now,

49:36.440 --> 49:41.044
but we have to take our own
futures into our own hands.

49:42.312 --> 49:45.449
That means both our
career aspirations

49:45.449 --> 49:47.617
and our women aspirations.

49:48.952 --> 49:51.688
- I just don't know if
this is where I need

49:51.688 --> 49:53.590
to be channeling
my energy, Alex.

49:53.590 --> 49:56.927
- How long ago did
that chick leave you?

49:58.295 --> 49:59.796
- You got a point.

50:07.070 --> 50:08.004
- Okay alright.

50:08.004 --> 50:09.373
Get yourself together.

50:09.373 --> 50:10.240
Here they come.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.676
- [Eric] I am together.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.244
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:15.445 --> 50:18.582
Alright, I'ma leave
this one up to you.

50:29.326 --> 50:30.594
- Excuse me.

50:30.594 --> 50:31.828
- Yes?

50:31.828 --> 50:34.164
- Hey, I was just
wondering if I could

50:34.164 --> 50:35.399
talk to you for a second.

50:35.399 --> 50:37.434
- Yeah, but make it quick.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.302
My stomach is growling.

50:39.302 --> 50:40.337
- Oh right.

50:40.337 --> 50:41.571
Well, I'm Eric.

50:42.439 --> 50:43.407
Nice to meet you.

50:43.407 --> 50:44.207
- Tanya.

50:47.811 --> 50:50.680
- It's a moving
service, wasn't it?

50:51.748 --> 50:54.584
- Were you really in service?

50:54.584 --> 50:55.385
- What?

50:58.355 --> 50:59.489
- Yes, yes.

50:59.489 --> 51:01.958
We were sitting in the back.

51:01.958 --> 51:03.927
- Well, I was in the back, too.

51:03.927 --> 51:06.163
- Well, it's a big church.

51:06.163 --> 51:07.130
- Big church.

51:07.130 --> 51:08.598
It's a big church.

51:08.598 --> 51:09.433
Huge.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.771
- I just find it surprising

51:14.771 --> 51:17.207
that two apparently
single men as yourselves

51:17.207 --> 51:19.042
would find the Pastor's service

51:19.042 --> 51:23.313
on discouraging
pre-marital sex so moving,

51:23.313 --> 51:24.881
and even more
surprising that you'd be

51:24.881 --> 51:26.650
right outside the church
after such a message

51:26.650 --> 51:28.752
trying to holler and
flirt with women.

51:28.752 --> 51:31.955
- We're not trying to
holler and flirt at women.

51:31.955 --> 51:33.356
No we're out here
searching for people

51:33.356 --> 51:36.726
to fellowship with like
yourself, you know,

51:36.726 --> 51:40.964
'cause we're starting
an abstinence group.

51:40.964 --> 51:41.798
- Oh.

51:43.166 --> 51:45.001
Is that right?

51:45.001 --> 51:47.204
- What my friend means
is that he'd love

51:47.204 --> 51:51.341
to get your phone number
and stay in contact.

51:51.341 --> 51:53.376
Get a bite to eat.

51:53.376 --> 51:54.845
Pray a little bit.

51:56.079 --> 51:57.013
- No.

51:57.013 --> 51:58.415
Thank you though.

51:58.415 --> 52:01.184
I've already got
somebody for that.

52:01.184 --> 52:02.252
Y'all a trip.

52:03.487 --> 52:05.055
Have a blessed day.

52:07.457 --> 52:08.291
- You too.

52:10.126 --> 52:11.595
- [Alex] You too.

52:11.595 --> 52:13.663
- Well that worked great.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.066
What's next?

52:17.267 --> 52:19.970
- Just gotta keep
punching like Ali.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.304
- Punching?

52:21.304 --> 52:22.138
Yeah.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.441
Yeah well at least
you got the number

52:24.441 --> 52:26.376
from that white girl.

52:26.376 --> 52:28.044
What's up with that?

52:30.013 --> 52:32.582
(upbeat music)

52:36.553 --> 52:40.924
♪ Ooh yeah

52:40.924 --> 52:44.861
♪ Yeah yeah yeah

52:44.861 --> 52:47.130
♪ Oh oh oh

52:49.966 --> 52:52.435
- So, what's up, Kim?

52:52.435 --> 52:55.472
I mean, this is our
third date, you know.

52:55.472 --> 52:57.173
- What do you mean what's up?

52:57.173 --> 52:59.142
- Well, I mean you know we been

52:59.142 --> 53:01.144
hanging out rather consistently.

53:01.144 --> 53:02.679
You know what I mean?

53:02.679 --> 53:05.115
I'm just trying to get an idea
of where this thing is going.

53:05.115 --> 53:06.349
- Well it's going.

53:06.349 --> 53:10.353
We'll continue to go out
and see what happens.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.455
- Okay alright, that's cool
but you know I'm just saying.

53:12.455 --> 53:14.724
I don't wanna be strung along

53:14.724 --> 53:17.928
if this thing isn't
going anywhere, you know.

53:17.928 --> 53:18.862
- No.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.797
If you're asking about the nana,

53:20.797 --> 53:23.233
then I'd have to say no no.

53:23.233 --> 53:26.269
Let's just wait and
see what happens.

53:26.269 --> 53:27.437
- Okay alright.

53:27.437 --> 53:28.872
Alright, I mean
that's cool, you know,

53:28.872 --> 53:31.841
but I mean I'm saying we haven't
any so much as kissed yet.

53:31.841 --> 53:33.076
You know what I mean?

53:33.076 --> 53:34.311
I mean, I just gotta
keep it 100 with you.

53:34.311 --> 53:35.545
I'm the type of guy
that likes to know

53:35.545 --> 53:37.948
where I stand with
someone I'm dating.

53:37.948 --> 53:39.649
You know what I mean?

53:39.649 --> 53:40.817
- Okay.

53:40.817 --> 53:42.586
Well first of all,
Brian, we're not dating.

53:42.586 --> 53:44.421
We're just hanging out.

53:44.421 --> 53:46.590
And secondly, I mean
sometimes these things

53:46.590 --> 53:48.391
just take time to develop.

53:48.391 --> 53:50.594
You're not just gonna
fall in love over night.

53:50.594 --> 53:51.595
Right?

53:51.595 --> 53:53.196
- Right, right.

53:53.196 --> 53:54.097
You right.

53:54.097 --> 53:55.031
Yeah, you right.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.166
You know it take a little time.

53:56.166 --> 53:57.434
Take a little time fall in love.

53:57.434 --> 53:58.668
You right, okay.

53:58.668 --> 54:01.271
But I mean you know,
you do like the dinners,

54:01.271 --> 54:03.106
the movies, and the concerts
and everything right?

54:03.106 --> 54:04.374
- Yeah, they cool.

54:04.374 --> 54:05.842
- [Brian] Oh okay, alright.

54:05.842 --> 54:09.012
- We'll just continue to have
fun and see where it goes.

54:09.012 --> 54:09.879
- Okay.

54:09.879 --> 54:10.747
- [Kim] Okay.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.781
- Alright, that's cool.

54:11.781 --> 54:12.682
That's cool.

54:12.682 --> 54:14.417
- Hey, I almost forgot.

54:14.417 --> 54:16.786
I gotta get gas in the morning

54:16.786 --> 54:18.855
and I don't have any cash on me

54:18.855 --> 54:22.592
and my darn ATM card
just keeps acting up.

54:22.592 --> 54:25.295
I just haven't had time
to go down to the bank

54:25.295 --> 54:27.564
and get it checked out yet.

54:28.732 --> 54:30.233
- Okay, alright.

54:30.233 --> 54:31.901
So what do you need?

54:32.969 --> 54:34.604
- Well, if you can loan me $20

54:34.604 --> 54:37.374
until I can get
down to the bank,

54:37.374 --> 54:40.577
you know I would
greatly appreciate it.

54:40.577 --> 54:42.312
- Greatly appreciate.

54:42.312 --> 54:44.748
Shoot, you ain't said
nothing but a thing.

54:44.748 --> 54:45.615
Come on now.

54:45.615 --> 54:46.750
I got you.

54:46.750 --> 54:47.751
Come on now.

54:47.751 --> 54:48.652
There you go right there.

54:48.652 --> 54:49.486
Take that.

54:54.457 --> 54:55.425
Girl you know what?

54:55.425 --> 54:56.660
Gas expensive.

54:56.660 --> 54:58.528
Went up another
15 cent last week.

54:58.528 --> 54:59.496
Hold on.

54:59.496 --> 55:00.597
Let me help you out there.

55:00.597 --> 55:02.165
There you go right there.

55:02.165 --> 55:03.400
- Oh, thank you, Brian.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.868
You know I greatly
appreciate this.

55:04.868 --> 55:06.169
I really do.

55:06.169 --> 55:07.771
I gotta fix this
freaking ATM card

55:07.771 --> 55:08.872
then I'll be real cool.

55:08.872 --> 55:09.839
I promise.

55:09.839 --> 55:10.874
- Come on girl.

55:10.874 --> 55:12.342
It ain't no problem.

55:12.342 --> 55:13.309
Aye.

55:13.309 --> 55:17.013
♪ That's what friends are for

55:18.748 --> 55:19.916
- Ooh, well you know what?

55:19.916 --> 55:21.418
I gotta get going right now.

55:21.418 --> 55:23.053
I got get up really early
for work in the morning.

55:23.053 --> 55:23.953
- Okay, alright.

55:23.953 --> 55:24.821
Wait hold on now.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.056
Hold on.

55:26.056 --> 55:27.390
I mean that's cool
and everything,

55:27.390 --> 55:30.026
but you know before you go.

55:30.026 --> 55:31.261
- Ooh.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.663
We are not ready
for that just yet.

55:33.663 --> 55:34.531
- But I thought--

55:34.531 --> 55:35.699
- Brian.

55:35.699 --> 55:38.702
Brian, now is not the time.

55:38.702 --> 55:40.270
Now you just keep on spending,

55:40.270 --> 55:43.106
I mean waiting and
you never know.

55:44.674 --> 55:46.509
I gotta go now, sweetie.

55:46.509 --> 55:47.577
- Never know.

55:50.914 --> 55:52.248
Oh yeah, you never know.

55:52.248 --> 55:53.349
I know something.

55:53.349 --> 55:54.984
I know I'm 'bout
to tear that up.

55:54.984 --> 55:55.952
That's what I know.

55:55.952 --> 55:57.554
Shoot, you never know.

55:57.554 --> 55:58.621
I know something.

55:58.621 --> 56:00.223
She tripping.

56:00.223 --> 56:03.626
You had second
thoughts, didn't you?

56:03.626 --> 56:04.861
- Nope.

56:04.861 --> 56:07.764
I almost forgot my
lunch for tomorrow.

56:08.631 --> 56:09.466
Bye bye.

56:12.535 --> 56:14.404
- Aw, she trying to
flirt with the food,

56:14.404 --> 56:16.473
come get the lunch and
flirt with me thing.

56:16.473 --> 56:17.540
That's what she doing.

56:17.540 --> 56:18.641
Okay, alright.

56:18.641 --> 56:19.709
I'ma flirt with you, too.

56:19.709 --> 56:22.112
I know what she trying to do.

56:25.949 --> 56:27.350
- What's up, boo?

56:38.928 --> 56:41.564
- I'm just checking
out some jobs, baby.

56:41.564 --> 56:44.300
Think it's time I got a
legitimate hustle, you know.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.669
Nigga need his whip fixed.

56:46.669 --> 56:49.539
Plus wanna be able to do some
more things for you, baby.

56:49.539 --> 56:51.207
- [Trina] Aww, baby.

56:52.041 --> 56:53.376
That's what's up.

56:53.376 --> 56:54.811
That's what I'm talking 'bout.

56:54.811 --> 56:56.379
- Yeah baby.

56:56.379 --> 56:57.647
- So what's up?

56:57.647 --> 56:59.582
What you get from
the 99 cent store?

56:59.582 --> 57:00.517
- [Trina] Oh you know.

57:00.517 --> 57:02.285
Just a few little things.

57:02.285 --> 57:03.753
Cleaning items.

57:03.753 --> 57:06.489
I thought I might hook
the house up a little bit.

57:06.489 --> 57:08.391
You know, starting
with the bathroom

57:08.391 --> 57:11.227
'cause you know
your aim is whack.

57:12.228 --> 57:13.463
- Whack?

57:13.463 --> 57:16.766
Hey, but I know just
how to hit your spot.

57:16.766 --> 57:19.135
Bullseye every time.

57:19.135 --> 57:20.703
- Speaking of that.

57:22.338 --> 57:24.274
I bought these for you.

57:28.711 --> 57:31.047
And I also got these for me.

57:35.552 --> 57:38.021
Just to stay on point.

57:38.021 --> 57:41.858
- [Dontae] Dual
colored latex condoms.

57:41.858 --> 57:43.092
Home pregnancy test.

57:43.092 --> 57:44.761
Damn baby, I didn't
know they sold

57:44.761 --> 57:46.262
all that shit at
the 99 cent store.

57:46.262 --> 57:49.199
- Yes, they do and you know
you been slipping lately

57:49.199 --> 57:52.402
so no more raw
dogging it for you.

57:52.402 --> 57:53.870
- That's bullshit.

57:53.870 --> 57:55.772
I know you better get your
ass down there to that clinic

57:55.772 --> 57:58.107
and get some more of
them pills of yours.

57:58.107 --> 57:59.542
- No, you better
get your ass down

57:59.542 --> 58:02.078
to the Social Security
office and get you a jiz-zob

58:02.078 --> 58:04.647
so you can get some
money to buy those pills.

58:04.647 --> 58:05.982
They ain't free.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.319
- Oh, you just got
all the answers, huh?

58:09.319 --> 58:10.887
You a fool with it.

58:10.887 --> 58:12.288
Come here, let me
tell you something.

58:12.288 --> 58:13.790
- [Trina] What?

58:13.790 --> 58:17.026
- Look, you trying to use these?

58:17.026 --> 58:19.295
What you gon' buy them for?

58:20.563 --> 58:22.398
You gotta see if they work.

58:22.398 --> 58:24.534
(upbeat music)

58:24.534 --> 58:26.135
- She paid.

58:26.135 --> 58:28.204
I can't believe she paid.

58:29.639 --> 58:33.243
I can't believe a woman
actually paid for a date.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.247
- [Deborah] Bernard,
you are crazy.

58:37.247 --> 58:38.748
- Hey, it's hard
enough to get a woman

58:38.748 --> 58:41.451
to pick up your phone
call let alone the tab.

58:41.451 --> 58:43.186
- Well, it's the
least I could do

58:43.186 --> 58:45.922
after that first
uncomfortable meeting we had.

58:45.922 --> 58:47.724
- Yeah, it was
quite interesting.

58:47.724 --> 58:50.426
Normally I would've
deleted you from my phone.

58:50.426 --> 58:53.263
- I'm glad you showed
patience with me

58:53.263 --> 58:55.865
because again, I am
re-acclimating myself

58:55.865 --> 58:58.134
to the wonderful
world of dating.

58:58.134 --> 59:00.703
- I understand that but I
don't think you understand

59:00.703 --> 59:02.705
what a monumental
moment this is.

59:02.705 --> 59:03.573
You know what?

59:03.573 --> 59:04.774
I gotta call my mother.

59:04.774 --> 59:05.708
- Okay, you can stop now.

59:05.708 --> 59:06.542
I get it.

59:07.977 --> 59:11.681
- But I really do appreciate
the gesture, Deborah, really.

59:11.681 --> 59:12.882
- I take it you haven't had

59:12.882 --> 59:15.518
that many successful
dates recently.

59:15.518 --> 59:18.154
- Success for me
is getting a smile

59:18.154 --> 59:20.723
and a thank you out of a woman.

59:22.158 --> 59:23.960
You know dating for
me isn't a pastime

59:23.960 --> 59:27.230
nor is it a recreational sport.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.265
You know but you gotta do it.

59:29.265 --> 59:30.667
Now marriage.

59:30.667 --> 59:32.635
Marriage, that seems easy.

59:32.635 --> 59:34.304
- This coming from
a man who has yet

59:34.304 --> 59:36.105
to walk down that path.

59:36.105 --> 59:39.509
Marriage has its benefits
but not guarantees.

59:39.509 --> 59:42.111
You wake up everyday
to the same person.

59:42.111 --> 59:44.080
You argue quite frequently.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.115
You have sex less frequently.

59:46.115 --> 59:47.216
And then you--

59:47.216 --> 59:48.651
- Get a divorce?

59:48.651 --> 59:51.254
- Yup, that's my story.

59:51.254 --> 59:54.357
But don't let me
discourage you though.

59:54.357 --> 59:57.860
- Sometimes you have
to throw it out there

59:58.861 --> 1:00:01.230
and see what you get.

1:00:01.230 --> 1:00:03.967
- Sometimes you'll come back
with the catch of your life

1:00:03.967 --> 1:00:08.705
or just something you'll have
to throw back into the sea.

1:00:10.139 --> 1:00:11.708
- Come on, let's
get out of here.

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:12.942
- Okay.

1:00:12.942 --> 1:00:14.143
- Let's spend some
more of your money.

1:00:14.143 --> 1:00:16.913
- (laughs) Okay.

1:00:26.122 --> 1:00:28.024
- So how's the job hunting?

1:00:28.024 --> 1:00:29.659
- Oh, it's going well.

1:00:29.659 --> 1:00:32.061
You know actually I
have some interviews

1:00:32.061 --> 1:00:34.964
I'm pretty optimistic about.

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:36.899
- And the lady hunting?

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:42.005
- You know.

1:00:43.439 --> 1:00:46.809
I ain't been doing
that lately, you know.

1:00:46.809 --> 1:00:48.544
Think I'ma just
sit back, you know.

1:00:48.544 --> 1:00:51.080
Just see how things happen.

1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:52.849
How 'bout you?

1:00:52.849 --> 1:00:57.086
- I gotta job interview this
week for a temp position

1:00:57.086 --> 1:00:59.322
that could lead to
a permanent one.

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:01.591
Right now I'll take
anything that I can get.

1:01:01.591 --> 1:01:03.726
This ballin' on a budget,
it ain't the business.

1:01:03.726 --> 1:01:05.962
- I feel you there.

1:01:05.962 --> 1:01:09.632
Yeah, my severance is
almost fully depleted.

1:01:11.067 --> 1:01:13.302
- Hey, you ever notice how
the job hunting process

1:01:13.302 --> 1:01:17.273
and dating parallel
each other so closely?

1:01:17.273 --> 1:01:19.976
- Nah, I can't say I do.

1:01:19.976 --> 1:01:23.012
- Yeah see, when you go
out on a job interview,

1:01:23.012 --> 1:01:24.914
you submit your resume
and you're evaluated

1:01:24.914 --> 1:01:27.150
based upon their criteria.

1:01:27.150 --> 1:01:29.919
When you go out on a date,
you're evaluated based upon

1:01:29.919 --> 1:01:32.722
your own personal
proverbial resume.

1:01:32.722 --> 1:01:35.425
- Oh and you're both
generally selected

1:01:35.425 --> 1:01:37.794
from a big pool of
applicants on both sides.

1:01:37.794 --> 1:01:39.062
- Exactly.

1:01:39.062 --> 1:01:40.563
- Yeah, you gotta
go through a bunch

1:01:40.563 --> 1:01:43.366
of bullshit on both sides
in hopes of being selected.

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:48.037
- And the more interviews you
get, the better your chances.

1:01:48.037 --> 1:01:49.172
Yeah.

1:01:49.172 --> 1:01:51.474
- True but unfortunately
the employers

1:01:51.474 --> 1:01:55.645
nor women seem to be
hiring niggas these days.

1:01:55.645 --> 1:01:58.381
- (laughs) Alex.

1:02:00.349 --> 1:02:01.617
- Case in point.

1:02:02.785 --> 1:02:05.521
This fine Mexican
chick back here.

1:02:05.521 --> 1:02:08.291
Now she's probably like most
of these Latin babes out here

1:02:08.291 --> 1:02:10.493
that they would rather talk to

1:02:10.493 --> 1:02:14.464
some shaved head chulo
with no ambition as opposed

1:02:14.464 --> 1:02:18.868
to a universally handsome
brother like ourselves.

1:02:18.868 --> 1:02:20.203
Full of potential.

1:02:20.203 --> 1:02:21.671
- What?

1:02:21.671 --> 1:02:24.574
I don't know about
that one, Alex.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:25.408
Alex.

1:02:26.809 --> 1:02:28.077
- [Alex] No?

1:02:28.077 --> 1:02:29.679
- I don't think so.

1:02:31.747 --> 1:02:33.649
- Well go and get
her number then.

1:02:33.649 --> 1:02:34.484
- Who me?

1:02:36.018 --> 1:02:37.653
- No, you.

1:02:37.653 --> 1:02:38.855
Go over and there
and give it a try.

1:02:38.855 --> 1:02:40.523
See how far you get.

1:02:42.125 --> 1:02:44.827
- Well I mean, shoot why not?

1:02:44.827 --> 1:02:47.797
I mean, sisters been
brutally rejecting me.

1:02:47.797 --> 1:02:49.732
Let's see how the Mexicanas do.

1:02:49.732 --> 1:02:50.900
Aye, aye, aye.

1:02:52.535 --> 1:02:53.903
Alright, I'ma go.

1:02:57.773 --> 1:03:00.309
(bright music)

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:21.030
(speaks in foreign language)

1:03:25.968 --> 1:03:30.406
- Yo, yo (speaks in
foreign language).

1:03:30.406 --> 1:03:31.641
My name is Eric.

1:03:31.641 --> 1:03:32.842
- Hi, Eric.

1:03:32.842 --> 1:03:33.676
I'm Marta.

1:03:33.676 --> 1:03:34.877
Nice to meet you.

1:03:34.877 --> 1:03:36.345
- Well good to meet you.

1:03:36.345 --> 1:03:39.015
It looks like you're
reading a book there.

1:03:39.015 --> 1:03:40.049
- I'm just studying.

1:03:40.049 --> 1:03:42.084
I'm a nursing student actually.

1:03:42.084 --> 1:03:42.985
- A student?

1:03:42.985 --> 1:03:44.987
Oh, oh that's good.

1:03:44.987 --> 1:03:45.922
That's good.

1:03:45.922 --> 1:03:47.390
Yeah, nah that's pretty cool.

1:03:47.390 --> 1:03:49.725
And you're studying
you said nursing?

1:03:49.725 --> 1:03:53.196
Yeah okay 'cause you gotta
get A's to be the top nurse.

1:03:53.196 --> 1:03:54.397
- [Marta] Gotta get A's.

1:03:54.397 --> 1:03:55.665
- In the hospital.

1:03:55.665 --> 1:03:57.233
Yeah.

1:03:57.233 --> 1:03:59.902
I probably let you get
back to studying then.

1:03:59.902 --> 1:04:02.905
It's nice to meet
you but maybe I can

1:04:03.906 --> 1:04:05.875
call you sometime though.

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:06.776
- I'm sorry.

1:04:06.776 --> 1:04:08.377
I have a boyfriend.

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:11.647
- Oh, don't be sorry.

1:04:11.647 --> 1:04:12.882
Nah, that's good.

1:04:12.882 --> 1:04:14.383
That's actually a good
thing 'cause I like

1:04:14.383 --> 1:04:16.152
when you know when men and
women getting together.

1:04:16.152 --> 1:04:18.955
You know, man and
woman coming together.

1:04:18.955 --> 1:04:22.425
So right, how
civilizations are created.

1:04:22.425 --> 1:04:24.093
Okay so, cool Marta.

1:04:25.161 --> 1:04:26.362
- [Marta] Eric.

1:04:26.362 --> 1:04:27.196
- You remember.

1:04:27.196 --> 1:04:28.464
That's good.

1:04:28.464 --> 1:04:30.866
So I think I'll like I
said I'll let you back

1:04:30.866 --> 1:04:32.802
to being the top nurse.

1:04:33.803 --> 1:04:34.670
- Bye.

1:04:34.670 --> 1:04:35.838
- [Eric] Okay.

1:04:43.613 --> 1:04:44.447
- So how'd it go?

1:04:44.447 --> 1:04:45.648
- Good.

1:04:45.648 --> 1:04:48.217
No, really, really good.

1:04:48.217 --> 1:04:51.087
You know, she was feeling me.

1:04:51.087 --> 1:04:54.857
She was really feeling me
but she had a boyfriend.

1:04:54.857 --> 1:04:56.692
Yeah, what can you do?

1:04:58.828 --> 1:05:02.798
- Well my friend,
rejection's a part of life.

1:05:02.798 --> 1:05:05.701
Unfortunately, we seem
to almost always be

1:05:05.701 --> 1:05:07.937
on the receiving end of it.

1:05:09.105 --> 1:05:13.242
- Right, but you know,
she had a boyfriend.

1:05:13.242 --> 1:05:15.978
So, I hardly call
that rejection.

1:05:26.122 --> 1:05:27.256
- Are you happy?

1:05:27.256 --> 1:05:28.291
- [Deborah] I'm happy.

1:05:28.291 --> 1:05:30.126
- Are you sure you're happy?

1:05:30.126 --> 1:05:32.061
- Yes, I'm sure I'm happy.

1:05:32.061 --> 1:05:33.562
Are you happy?

1:05:33.562 --> 1:05:34.497
- I'm cool.

1:05:34.497 --> 1:05:36.565
- What does that mean, I'm cool?

1:05:36.565 --> 1:05:38.901
- It means I'm content.

1:05:38.901 --> 1:05:41.570
I like some of the
guys I'm dating.

1:05:41.570 --> 1:05:43.406
I mean most of 'em.

1:05:43.406 --> 1:05:44.907
They all serve a purpose.

1:05:44.907 --> 1:05:47.643
I can't just easily narrow
in on one man like you.

1:05:47.643 --> 1:05:49.679
- Most men X themselves out.

1:05:49.679 --> 1:05:50.813
Remember Ricky?

1:05:50.813 --> 1:05:52.214
That guy I met at the gym

1:05:52.214 --> 1:05:54.216
and then regretted
giving my number to?

1:05:54.216 --> 1:05:55.451
- Vaguely.

1:05:55.451 --> 1:05:57.820
- He called me asking
me to come through.

1:05:57.820 --> 1:06:00.456
When I told him I had
the kids he said so what?

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:01.490
Put 'em to sleep.

1:06:01.490 --> 1:06:02.625
And you know what I said?

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:03.459
- [Kim] What?

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:04.293
- Nothing.

1:06:04.293 --> 1:06:05.795
I hung up on his ass.

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:07.630
Thank God for caller ID.

1:06:07.630 --> 1:06:09.065
I just hope he gets the message

1:06:09.065 --> 1:06:11.167
when I don't return
his phone calls.

1:06:11.167 --> 1:06:13.302
- I mean girl, some men
just don't get it, right?

1:06:13.302 --> 1:06:15.838
It's like, if you call
me two times or more

1:06:15.838 --> 1:06:17.239
and I have not
called you back yet,

1:06:17.239 --> 1:06:19.542
it means I'm not
interested in you.

1:06:19.542 --> 1:06:22.011
- Is it still okay to
give out fake numbers

1:06:22.011 --> 1:06:24.046
or did that play out in the 90s?

1:06:24.046 --> 1:06:26.916
- Deborah, now you have to
do whatever you have to do

1:06:26.916 --> 1:06:29.218
to shake off the undesirables.

1:06:29.218 --> 1:06:32.655
- Why does dating have
to be so difficult?

1:06:32.655 --> 1:06:35.091
- Was marriage
that more simpler?

1:06:35.091 --> 1:06:37.593
Just take care of you alright?

1:06:38.594 --> 1:06:40.429
- Seems selfish.

1:06:40.429 --> 1:06:43.799
You know, Bernard and I
went out the other day.

1:06:43.799 --> 1:06:44.934
- Oh really?

1:06:44.934 --> 1:06:45.868
Now wait a second.

1:06:45.868 --> 1:06:47.103
I thought you messed that up.

1:06:47.103 --> 1:06:48.904
- He understood this
whole dating thing

1:06:48.904 --> 1:06:50.606
is a major adjustment for me,

1:06:50.606 --> 1:06:54.443
and as a good faith gesture
I paid for the date.

1:06:54.443 --> 1:06:56.112
- You did what?

1:06:56.112 --> 1:06:57.880
Okay, did you go
on a coffee date?

1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:00.449
- No, we went to a show
and then lunch afterwards.

1:07:00.449 --> 1:07:04.120
- Deborah, women don't
have to pay for dates

1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:05.755
because we don't have to.

1:07:05.755 --> 1:07:07.656
It's about supply and demand,

1:07:07.656 --> 1:07:10.693
and men demand what we
have to supply them with.

1:07:10.693 --> 1:07:12.862
And you know what that is.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:15.664
And you gotta make
'em work for it.

1:07:15.664 --> 1:07:17.366
- This is too difficult for me.

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:18.667
- Oh my goodness.

1:07:18.667 --> 1:07:20.169
Paying for a date.

1:07:22.505 --> 1:07:23.572
- Come on, pick up.

1:07:23.572 --> 1:07:24.840
Pick up.

1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:27.343
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:07:30.312 --> 1:07:33.149
(phone vibrating)

1:07:34.950 --> 1:07:36.719
Alex, what's up man?

1:07:36.719 --> 1:07:38.220
- Nothing much.

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:41.056
Just getting ready for my
big date coming through.

1:07:41.056 --> 1:07:42.291
- Oh okay, okay.

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:44.293
Well you know, I'ma let
you get back to that,

1:07:44.293 --> 1:07:48.264
but aye before I do, got
some good news for you, man.

1:07:48.264 --> 1:07:49.732
About your boy.

1:07:49.732 --> 1:07:51.400
- Shoot, I'm listening.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:53.536
- Alright well you know.

1:07:53.536 --> 1:07:55.037
Speaking of dates.

1:07:56.605 --> 1:07:58.340
I met a cool girl, man.

1:07:58.340 --> 1:07:59.442
A real cool girl.

1:07:59.442 --> 1:08:00.609
Guess what?

1:08:00.609 --> 1:08:01.410
- What's up?

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:02.678
- She black.

1:08:02.678 --> 1:08:03.913
She black, man.

1:08:03.913 --> 1:08:06.315
I mean, she beautiful,
cool, down to earth.

1:08:06.315 --> 1:08:07.583
Real good personality.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:10.920
Man, she act like she
got her own stuff.

1:08:11.854 --> 1:08:13.456
- Cool.

1:08:13.456 --> 1:08:16.158
- And man look, you'll
never believe it.

1:08:16.158 --> 1:08:18.093
I got a second interview
for this job, man.

1:08:18.093 --> 1:08:19.995
It's a real good one, too.

1:08:19.995 --> 1:08:22.331
Pays more than the last one.

1:08:23.432 --> 1:08:25.501
- Aye, that's tight, man.

1:08:28.003 --> 1:08:29.405
Yeah, seems like you got things

1:08:29.405 --> 1:08:30.773
moving in the right direction.

1:08:30.773 --> 1:08:33.209
Looks like you really
doing your thing.

1:08:33.209 --> 1:08:35.911
Well look, let me
know how it goes.

1:08:35.911 --> 1:08:36.779
- Oh yeah, no doubt.

1:08:36.779 --> 1:08:38.314
I will, I will.

1:08:38.314 --> 1:08:40.549
You know, let me let you get
back to your business, man.

1:08:40.549 --> 1:08:42.084
Handle yours.

1:08:42.084 --> 1:08:45.855
And I'm just gonna get ready
for this big date tomorrow.

1:08:45.855 --> 1:08:47.389
- Okay cool.

1:08:47.389 --> 1:08:48.858
- Alright man.

1:08:48.858 --> 1:08:49.692
- Yeah.

1:09:03.939 --> 1:09:06.342
(soft music)

1:09:52.555 --> 1:09:55.457
(knocking on door)

1:10:16.712 --> 1:10:18.581
- What's happening, Alex?

1:10:18.581 --> 1:10:19.715
- Bertha.

1:10:19.715 --> 1:10:21.483
Hurry up, come on in.

1:10:22.651 --> 1:10:25.221
(upbeat music)

1:10:26.488 --> 1:10:28.591
Have a seat on the couch.

1:10:30.559 --> 1:10:32.561
On the couch, Bertha.

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:34.063
Not in the kitchen.

1:10:34.063 --> 1:10:35.397
- Oh okay, cool.

1:10:36.999 --> 1:10:39.768
Wow, I've never seen your place
with the lights on before.

1:10:39.768 --> 1:10:41.003
Looks fly.

1:10:41.003 --> 1:10:41.971
- Oh yeah.

1:10:41.971 --> 1:10:44.006
I just like to conserve energy.

1:10:44.006 --> 1:10:46.675
No need in wasting energy
if we don't have to.

1:10:46.675 --> 1:10:48.444
- Oh okay, well
I'm feeling that.

1:10:48.444 --> 1:10:53.415
That's real with your cute
energy conscious self (laughs).

1:10:54.316 --> 1:10:56.585
What you got the yak out?

1:10:56.585 --> 1:10:59.688
But you ain't got no food
to go with this drink

1:10:59.688 --> 1:11:02.524
'cause I'm working with an
empty stomach over here?

1:11:02.524 --> 1:11:03.559
- You sure about that?

1:11:03.559 --> 1:11:04.593
- Huh?

1:11:04.593 --> 1:11:06.362
- It's 11 o'clock so.

1:11:08.631 --> 1:11:10.065
- Yeah I guess you right.

1:11:10.065 --> 1:11:12.401
It is kind of late
for me to be munching.

1:11:12.401 --> 1:11:16.572
Speaking of late how come you
always invite me over so late?

1:11:16.572 --> 1:11:20.175
- Well you know I'm working
the swing shift these days.

1:11:20.175 --> 1:11:21.510
Two to 10 so.

1:11:21.510 --> 1:11:22.344
- Oh okay.

1:11:23.746 --> 1:11:26.315
Well, let me get my head
right before I hook you up.

1:11:26.315 --> 1:11:27.816
You know how I do.

1:11:31.553 --> 1:11:33.889
Ooh, I'm finna to get faded.

1:11:35.290 --> 1:11:39.395
I might have to crash at
your place tonight if I do.

1:11:53.842 --> 1:11:56.412
(upbeat music)

1:12:01.684 --> 1:12:03.619
- I got a job.

1:12:03.619 --> 1:12:04.453
Yes.

1:12:07.189 --> 1:12:09.391
And I got a date.

1:12:09.391 --> 1:12:10.993
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1:12:12.861 --> 1:12:14.396
I got a job.

1:12:14.396 --> 1:12:15.230
Yes.

1:12:16.432 --> 1:12:17.266
Yes.

1:12:19.168 --> 1:12:21.770
(bright music)

1:12:40.756 --> 1:12:44.827
So I guess it's safe to assume
you don't have a boyfriend.

1:12:44.827 --> 1:12:45.661
Right?

1:12:47.863 --> 1:12:51.667
I mean hey, you never
know these days.

1:12:51.667 --> 1:12:55.370
Just let me know
if I talk too much.

1:12:55.370 --> 1:12:57.606
I have a tendency to do that.

1:12:57.606 --> 1:13:00.676
It's this nervous thing I got.

1:13:00.676 --> 1:13:01.510
Yeah.

1:13:06.615 --> 1:13:10.686
You ever been on a date
and you just dying inside

1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:16.024
to know what the other
person's thinking?

1:13:16.024 --> 1:13:16.859
Yeah.

1:13:19.828 --> 1:13:22.431
And this whole dating process
can be a pretty painful thing.

1:13:22.431 --> 1:13:23.966
Right?

1:13:23.966 --> 1:13:28.737
You trying to figure
out somebody's dislikes
and their likes

1:13:30.105 --> 1:13:33.642
and hoping that you don't
say the wrong thing.

1:13:33.642 --> 1:13:37.146
I mean, I like bowling
and you like bowling.

1:13:37.146 --> 1:13:40.682
I like Mexican food and
you like Mexican food.

1:13:40.682 --> 1:13:42.251
You like the
missionary position.

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:44.820
I love the missionary position.

1:13:45.687 --> 1:13:47.656
That was a joke.

1:13:47.656 --> 1:13:51.326
I was just seeing if
you were still with me.

1:13:52.227 --> 1:13:53.662
Oh God.

1:13:53.662 --> 1:13:56.498
I hope I didn't say the wrong
thing and screw this up.

1:13:56.498 --> 1:13:57.332
Did I?

1:14:01.637 --> 1:14:05.674
Okay 'cause it's this dry
sense of humor I got, you know.

1:14:05.674 --> 1:14:09.344
Some people don't pick
up on it immediately.

1:14:10.712 --> 1:14:15.350
I guess that's why I'm probably
relationship type of guy.

1:14:16.852 --> 1:14:20.489
I mean 'cause of
moments like this.

1:14:20.489 --> 1:14:23.826
I feel silly right
now, you know.

1:14:23.826 --> 1:14:24.660
Should I?

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:32.801
So we're cool then?

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:38.974
So am I gonna get a second date?

1:14:43.879 --> 1:14:45.314
Cool.

1:14:45.314 --> 1:14:47.883
(upbeat music)

1:15:01.964 --> 1:15:03.699
- I know this shirt little.

1:15:03.699 --> 1:15:04.833
Maybe they'll give
me a bigger one

1:15:04.833 --> 1:15:07.236
when I get off probation.

1:15:07.236 --> 1:15:09.738
- [Trina] You look good, baby.

1:15:11.673 --> 1:15:14.443
- What is that you over
there preparing, baby?

1:15:14.443 --> 1:15:17.145
- Just a little something
before your first day at work.

1:15:17.145 --> 1:15:18.080
You know.

1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:19.314
- Is that what I think it is?

1:15:19.314 --> 1:15:20.249
- [Trina] A little something.

1:15:20.249 --> 1:15:21.483
- Is that what I think it is?

1:15:21.483 --> 1:15:22.551
- Just a little something.

1:15:22.551 --> 1:15:23.852
- The OG fried bologna.

1:15:23.852 --> 1:15:26.121
Baby, is that that
processed meat?

1:15:26.121 --> 1:15:27.623
That's the fuck I'm
talking about, baby.

1:15:27.623 --> 1:15:29.391
Damn, if I had known it
was going down like that,

1:15:29.391 --> 1:15:31.727
a nigga would've been got a job.

1:15:31.727 --> 1:15:33.028
I ain't had one of
them motherfuckers

1:15:33.028 --> 1:15:35.063
since I was a little kid.

1:15:35.063 --> 1:15:36.231
Shit.

1:15:36.231 --> 1:15:38.233
- I'm so proud of you, boo.

1:15:38.233 --> 1:15:40.402
Get your orange juice
over there on the counter.

1:15:40.402 --> 1:15:41.637
- For sure, baby.

1:15:41.637 --> 1:15:43.138
Know you a trip
though, you know.

1:15:43.138 --> 1:15:46.341
Even though a nigga got
this little part time job,

1:15:46.341 --> 1:15:48.477
you know your boy still
gonna be out here grinding.

1:15:48.477 --> 1:15:51.246
I'm talking about putting it
in every night, every day.

1:15:51.246 --> 1:15:53.348
You know, just a little
62 ain't nothing, baby.

1:15:53.348 --> 1:15:55.651
Niggas don't even get up
'til four o'clock anyways,

1:15:55.651 --> 1:15:57.853
so I'm just gonna get
this legal paper in,

1:15:57.853 --> 1:16:00.055
and at 2:05 every
motherfucking day,

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:02.324
I'm on the block
getting my cheese,

1:16:02.324 --> 1:16:04.026
getting these pillows
out on they ass.

1:16:04.026 --> 1:16:05.360
Baby, they want this kush.

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:06.328
- [Trina] Uh uh, you crazy.

1:16:06.328 --> 1:16:07.529
Come get this sandwich.

1:16:07.529 --> 1:16:08.664
- Shit, you ain't gotta
tell me twice, baby.

1:16:08.664 --> 1:16:09.598
Thank you.

1:16:09.598 --> 1:16:10.999
- [Trina] You're welcome.

1:16:10.999 --> 1:16:13.368
- [Dontae] Damn, I
like you so much.

1:16:13.368 --> 1:16:14.469
- Like?

1:16:14.469 --> 1:16:15.404
- Shit.

1:16:15.404 --> 1:16:16.505
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

1:16:16.505 --> 1:16:17.739
Aye, on the real, baby.

1:16:17.739 --> 1:16:18.674
- What?

1:16:18.674 --> 1:16:20.409
- Trill shit.

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:22.244
You might be a keeper.

1:16:23.645 --> 1:16:24.947
I mean, you keep
up the good work.

1:16:24.947 --> 1:16:26.315
- Please, you already know.

1:16:26.315 --> 1:16:27.416
This shit right here.

1:16:27.416 --> 1:16:29.084
This shit right here, nigga.

1:16:29.084 --> 1:16:30.519
This shit is the bam.

1:16:30.519 --> 1:16:31.420
Okay, don't play.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:32.621
- We'll see.

1:16:32.621 --> 1:16:35.357
We'll check your
progress report out.

1:16:48.537 --> 1:16:51.039
- Yo, I've been thinking, man.

1:16:52.607 --> 1:16:55.577
I've been settling for less.

1:16:55.577 --> 1:16:58.146
I mean, I got this temp job.

1:16:58.146 --> 1:17:01.183
Got a bunch of regular
broads on my team.

1:17:01.183 --> 1:17:03.185
I gotta step my game up.

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.387
- Yeah nah I know.

1:17:05.387 --> 1:17:07.189
I mean, I was
feeling the same way.

1:17:07.189 --> 1:17:10.192
Like I should be further
in life or something,

1:17:10.192 --> 1:17:13.161
but then I got this job, man,
that I'm starting next week

1:17:13.161 --> 1:17:15.697
and the girl that
I'm kicking with now.

1:17:15.697 --> 1:17:17.165
Man, I'm feeling her.

1:17:17.165 --> 1:17:19.234
Yeah you know, I feel like
things are back on track now.

1:17:19.234 --> 1:17:20.068
You know?

1:17:23.605 --> 1:17:25.774
- You know I like you, Eric.

1:17:25.774 --> 1:17:27.209
You remind me of me.

1:17:27.209 --> 1:17:28.977
The way I used to be.

1:17:28.977 --> 1:17:29.811
Nice guy.

1:17:31.179 --> 1:17:34.349
But nice guys, well
you know the rest.

1:17:36.351 --> 1:17:40.389
The corporate America and
these broads out here,

1:17:40.389 --> 1:17:43.125
they will chew you
up and spit you out

1:17:43.125 --> 1:17:45.093
when they're done with you.

1:17:45.093 --> 1:17:48.030
- Yeah I mean, I know
what you're saying.

1:17:48.030 --> 1:17:50.632
I know, but I gotta be me, man.

1:17:53.335 --> 1:17:55.971
- Being you ain't working, dog.

1:17:55.971 --> 1:17:59.841
I mean, you dripping
with weak sauce.

1:17:59.841 --> 1:18:01.810
I mean look at you, man.

1:18:01.810 --> 1:18:03.445
- Whoa, what's wrong with me?

1:18:03.445 --> 1:18:05.947
- Yo, you gotta start
thinking outside the box, man.

1:18:05.947 --> 1:18:07.582
Come on, live a little bit.

1:18:07.582 --> 1:18:08.417
Sack up.

1:18:09.818 --> 1:18:11.219
You falling in love with a chick

1:18:11.219 --> 1:18:14.289
you just met two weeks ago.

1:18:14.289 --> 1:18:15.791
Come on.

1:18:15.791 --> 1:18:17.726
Man, for real.

1:18:17.726 --> 1:18:19.594
- Man you know, I mean.

1:18:19.594 --> 1:18:20.996
That's what I want, I mean.

1:18:20.996 --> 1:18:21.930
What's wrong with that?

1:18:21.930 --> 1:18:24.232
I don't see what's wrong.

1:18:24.232 --> 1:18:26.101
- You making my
allergies act up.

1:18:26.101 --> 1:18:27.736
- Your allergies?

1:18:27.736 --> 1:18:31.406
- Yeah 'cause I'm
allergic to relationships

1:18:31.406 --> 1:18:33.442
and I'm damn sure allergic
to falling in love

1:18:33.442 --> 1:18:36.511
with a girl I just
met two weeks ago.

1:18:38.580 --> 1:18:42.084
Eric, for a man there's
absolutely nothing

1:18:44.152 --> 1:18:47.489
to be gained by being
in a relationship.

1:18:50.826 --> 1:18:54.830
Oh, I detect a little bit
of anxiety over there.

1:18:56.898 --> 1:18:58.333
Oh, oh, oh.

1:18:58.333 --> 1:19:00.035
Case I see you sweating all up

1:19:00.035 --> 1:19:02.104
in the neck and chest area.

1:19:02.104 --> 1:19:03.371
What's going on?

1:19:03.371 --> 1:19:04.539
You feeling kind of
uneasy or something?

1:19:04.539 --> 1:19:06.208
- Man, whatever man.

1:19:07.275 --> 1:19:08.844
- Okay.

1:19:08.844 --> 1:19:10.545
I'm a fair man.

1:19:10.545 --> 1:19:11.413
I'm a fair guy.

1:19:11.413 --> 1:19:12.647
How 'bout this?

1:19:13.648 --> 1:19:16.418
Give me one good
reason for a man

1:19:16.418 --> 1:19:19.254
to ever settle
down let alone now?

1:19:25.660 --> 1:19:26.995
- Companionship.

1:19:30.699 --> 1:19:32.200
- Seriously?

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.602
- Yeah.

1:19:33.602 --> 1:19:35.570
- That's the best reason
you can come up with?

1:19:35.570 --> 1:19:39.808
Eric, I have a new companion
every night in my bed.

1:19:41.409 --> 1:19:42.878
- Alex, I don't get you, man.

1:19:42.878 --> 1:19:43.712
I mean.

1:19:45.113 --> 1:19:47.549
Some woman hurt you, man?

1:19:47.549 --> 1:19:49.818
Like, did somewhere
along the line

1:19:49.818 --> 1:19:53.221
some lady just absolutely
do you wrong or something?

1:19:53.221 --> 1:19:57.659
Is this where you get your
disdain for women from?

1:19:57.659 --> 1:19:59.427
- No, I don't get hurt.

1:19:59.427 --> 1:20:01.463
I brings the pain, dog.

1:20:01.463 --> 1:20:02.364
- Oh.

1:20:02.364 --> 1:20:03.331
- You see.

1:20:03.331 --> 1:20:04.633
I brings the pain.

1:20:04.633 --> 1:20:07.002
See, the last time a
woman came up to me.

1:20:07.002 --> 1:20:10.739
Chick come up to me talking
'bout some sort of relationship,

1:20:10.739 --> 1:20:12.941
she left out of my
crib with my size 13's

1:20:12.941 --> 1:20:16.178
attached to her behind, yeah.

1:20:16.178 --> 1:20:18.446
Chick named Allison.

1:20:18.446 --> 1:20:19.281
Yeah.

1:20:21.383 --> 1:20:22.784
Yeah, oh Allison.

1:20:24.085 --> 1:20:26.655
She was alright but she's okay,

1:20:29.224 --> 1:20:31.793
but I mean I just
kept her around

1:20:31.793 --> 1:20:34.696
'cause she was a
beast in the bed.

1:20:34.696 --> 1:20:35.697
I mean, ooh.

1:20:36.965 --> 1:20:39.801
Yeah and she bought
me stuff, too.

1:20:41.403 --> 1:20:46.107
Decorated half of my
apartment (laughs).

1:20:47.609 --> 1:20:48.810
- Allison, huh?

1:20:49.844 --> 1:20:51.413
- [Alex] Yeah.

1:20:51.413 --> 1:20:53.982
- Yeah I mean,
that's a common name.

1:20:53.982 --> 1:20:56.084
Yeah, so I mean.

1:20:56.084 --> 1:20:57.786
She was pretty
cool though, right?

1:20:57.786 --> 1:20:59.988
- Yeah, she was straight.

1:20:59.988 --> 1:21:01.489
She was straight.

1:21:01.489 --> 1:21:03.925
Just not relationship material.

1:21:03.925 --> 1:21:08.196
Now if, if I ever settle
down, she gotta be a dime.

1:21:10.899 --> 1:21:13.201
A ten piece, you feel me?

1:21:13.201 --> 1:21:14.803
- Yeah.

1:21:14.803 --> 1:21:15.870
Yeah, no, no.

1:21:15.870 --> 1:21:16.705
No, man, no.

1:21:16.705 --> 1:21:18.707
You know what, Alex man?

1:21:18.707 --> 1:21:20.742
I ain't trying to knock your
style or nothing like that,

1:21:20.742 --> 1:21:23.979
but I think I'm a one
woman at a time kinda dude.

1:21:23.979 --> 1:21:27.883
That's just what makes me
comfortable, man really.

1:21:27.883 --> 1:21:28.984
- Cool, cool.

1:21:30.252 --> 1:21:31.820
But when your little
heart gets stepped on

1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:34.723
by a stiletto heel,
don't come running to me.

1:21:34.723 --> 1:21:35.557
Okay?

1:21:36.758 --> 1:21:39.261
- Hope to God I don't have to.

1:21:47.435 --> 1:21:48.637
Here you go.

1:21:48.637 --> 1:21:51.172
- Appreciate it, man.

1:21:51.172 --> 1:21:52.407
- Aye, you know what?

1:21:52.407 --> 1:21:53.575
I was thinking about
having a little

1:21:53.575 --> 1:21:54.910
get together at my house.

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:55.877
You know what I mean?

1:21:55.877 --> 1:21:57.946
Like celebrate my ventures.

1:21:57.946 --> 1:21:58.914
Got the new job.

1:21:58.914 --> 1:22:00.815
Have some people come over.

1:22:00.815 --> 1:22:02.050
What you think?

1:22:02.050 --> 1:22:03.652
- I'm down with that.

1:22:03.652 --> 1:22:05.854
I'll invite a few people
if you don't mind.

1:22:05.854 --> 1:22:06.788
You know what I'm saying?

1:22:06.788 --> 1:22:07.756
We'll make the most of it.

1:22:07.756 --> 1:22:08.690
- Yeah, alright.

1:22:08.690 --> 1:22:10.191
The more the merrier.

1:22:10.191 --> 1:22:11.026
- Cool.

1:22:11.026 --> 1:22:11.860
- Alright cool.

1:22:11.860 --> 1:22:12.861
- You ready?

1:22:19.868 --> 1:22:23.638
- [Allison] Oh, I can't
believe you said that.

1:22:23.638 --> 1:22:26.841
- [Eric] Say the craziest
things sometimes.

1:22:26.841 --> 1:22:28.843
- This is some good coffee.

1:22:28.843 --> 1:22:31.112
- Oh yeah, I guess
we got a good batch.

1:22:31.112 --> 1:22:32.380
I don't know.

1:22:32.380 --> 1:22:33.715
- So this is one of
your favorite spots?

1:22:33.715 --> 1:22:34.549
- Yeah.

1:22:35.417 --> 1:22:36.618
- Yeah?

1:22:36.618 --> 1:22:38.386
- Yeah nah, I'd say
this is my spot.

1:22:38.386 --> 1:22:39.220
- Really?

1:22:40.121 --> 1:22:41.389
- Yeah.

1:22:41.389 --> 1:22:43.258
- Why don't you bring
me back here sometime?

1:22:43.258 --> 1:22:44.359
Quality date.

1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:47.929
Good coffee, good conversation.

1:22:48.763 --> 1:22:50.765
Of course good people.

1:22:50.765 --> 1:22:52.500
- Well cheers.

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:53.868
Clink.

1:22:53.868 --> 1:22:54.969
(laughing)

1:22:54.969 --> 1:22:55.804
- I do that.

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:56.938
- Stop playing.

1:22:56.938 --> 1:22:57.772
- I do.

1:22:57.772 --> 1:22:58.606
I do that.

1:22:58.606 --> 1:22:59.441
- No you don't.

1:22:59.441 --> 1:23:00.208
- Yes, I do.

1:23:00.208 --> 1:23:01.309
I say clink.

1:23:01.309 --> 1:23:02.844
- Well you know.

1:23:02.844 --> 1:23:04.212
Good minds think alike.

1:23:04.212 --> 1:23:05.046
Great, great.

1:23:05.046 --> 1:23:06.014
We're great.

1:23:06.014 --> 1:23:06.848
- Great.

1:23:07.916 --> 1:23:08.750
- Clink.

1:23:14.789 --> 1:23:15.690
Good, good.

1:23:17.158 --> 1:23:18.393
You know I really never thought

1:23:18.393 --> 1:23:20.662
I'd be eating one
of these things.

1:23:20.662 --> 1:23:22.163
- Why not?

1:23:22.163 --> 1:23:24.432
- Well you know, I mean.

1:23:24.432 --> 1:23:25.934
Buying hot dogs
from a corner cart

1:23:25.934 --> 1:23:28.303
ain't necessarily the most
sanitary thing in the world.

1:23:28.303 --> 1:23:29.337
You know?

1:23:29.337 --> 1:23:31.306
- Ouch, mood killer.

1:23:31.306 --> 1:23:33.475
- I'm just saying you
know the health department

1:23:33.475 --> 1:23:35.210
probably don't go
around slinging licenses

1:23:35.210 --> 1:23:36.711
to people selling meat products

1:23:36.711 --> 1:23:39.214
on these small infested
streets of L.A., you know.

1:23:39.214 --> 1:23:41.516
- Ouch, mood killer.

1:23:41.516 --> 1:23:43.218
- I'm sorry.

1:23:43.218 --> 1:23:44.786
- That's alright 'cause
this is way too good

1:23:44.786 --> 1:23:46.821
to stop eating it now, right?

1:23:46.821 --> 1:23:47.756
Try with the jalapenos.

1:23:47.756 --> 1:23:48.590
Try the jalapenos.

1:23:48.590 --> 1:23:50.759
- Ooh, that's hot.

1:23:50.759 --> 1:23:51.826
- That's good, right.

1:23:51.826 --> 1:23:54.095
(laughing)

1:23:55.430 --> 1:23:57.031
Oh my God.

1:23:57.031 --> 1:23:58.600
I love it down here.

1:23:58.600 --> 1:23:59.467
- Oh, it's nice.

1:23:59.467 --> 1:24:00.268
I like this.

1:24:00.268 --> 1:24:01.736
- Yeah.

1:24:01.736 --> 1:24:02.670
- It makes it feel like the
east coast a little bit.

1:24:02.670 --> 1:24:03.538
- A little bit.

1:24:03.538 --> 1:24:04.539
I like it.

1:24:04.539 --> 1:24:05.907
It's good.

1:24:05.907 --> 1:24:06.741
Come on.

1:24:10.011 --> 1:24:14.315
Well, I guess my diet's
gone out the window today.

1:24:14.315 --> 1:24:15.550
- [Eric] What you talking 'bout?

1:24:15.550 --> 1:24:17.419
I thought we were
living a little.

1:24:17.419 --> 1:24:18.353
- Point well taken.

1:24:18.353 --> 1:24:19.521
- [Eric] Okay.

1:24:21.523 --> 1:24:23.291
- You know, who
knew you could meet

1:24:23.291 --> 1:24:26.227
such a sweetheart
at a gas station?

1:24:27.629 --> 1:24:30.799
- Well I just say thank
God your gas cap was stuck.

1:24:30.799 --> 1:24:33.701
Otherwise I never would
have approached you.

1:24:33.701 --> 1:24:35.236
I was checking you out though.

1:24:35.236 --> 1:24:36.070
- [Allison] Yeah?

1:24:36.070 --> 1:24:37.739
- [Eric] Mhmm, yeah.

1:24:37.739 --> 1:24:38.973
Yeah.

1:24:38.973 --> 1:24:40.208
- Well you know there
is this homeless guy

1:24:40.208 --> 1:24:42.210
I let pump my gas before that,

1:24:42.210 --> 1:24:44.245
and he was a little
heavy on the twisting.

1:24:44.245 --> 1:24:46.114
- Oh well thank you
Joe homeless guy.

1:24:46.114 --> 1:24:47.715
(laughing)

1:24:47.715 --> 1:24:51.953
Otherwise I never would have
met lady at pump number six.

1:24:51.953 --> 1:24:54.889
- Thank you gentleman
at pump number seven.

1:24:54.889 --> 1:24:57.392
Coffee, hot dogs, yogurt.

1:24:57.392 --> 1:24:58.326
- What?

1:24:58.326 --> 1:24:59.794
- I'm a cheap date.

1:24:59.794 --> 1:25:01.329
- Oh no, no.

1:25:01.329 --> 1:25:02.764
- Well wait.

1:25:02.764 --> 1:25:05.934
You couldn't have spent
more than what $20.

1:25:05.934 --> 1:25:08.937
- Actually $21 but
no more than $40.

1:25:10.071 --> 1:25:11.739
But who's counting, right?

1:25:11.739 --> 1:25:12.574
- You are.

1:25:12.574 --> 1:25:14.542
(laughing)

1:25:14.542 --> 1:25:17.779
- Yeah, but the
chemistry's great

1:25:17.779 --> 1:25:20.148
and I'd say that's priceless.

1:25:20.148 --> 1:25:22.217
- Indeed it is.

1:25:22.217 --> 1:25:23.051
- Yeah.

1:25:25.887 --> 1:25:26.721
Listen.

1:25:28.456 --> 1:25:29.958
I got probably
less than two weeks

1:25:29.958 --> 1:25:32.427
before I have to go back to work

1:25:32.427 --> 1:25:36.498
and I'd really like
it if we could spend

1:25:36.498 --> 1:25:40.001
maybe every other day
together until then.

1:25:40.001 --> 1:25:42.837
If that's not asking too much.

1:25:42.837 --> 1:25:45.106
- No, it may not be enough.

1:25:47.342 --> 1:25:49.177
(upbeat music)

1:25:49.177 --> 1:25:50.278
♪ Yeah

1:25:50.278 --> 1:25:52.146
♪ Ooh

1:25:52.146 --> 1:25:55.450
- [Alex] Honestly, I've
very proud of you, Eric.

1:25:55.450 --> 1:25:58.052
- [Eric] Oh, well

1:25:58.052 --> 1:26:00.822

1:26:00.822 --> 1:26:03.424

1:26:03.424 --> 1:26:05.026

1:26:05.026 --> 1:26:06.227

1:26:06.227 --> 1:26:07.896

1:26:07.896 --> 1:26:09.898

1:26:12.267 --> 1:26:13.501
- Alright, man.

1:26:13.501 --> 1:26:14.969
- Let's go check out
some other folks.

1:26:14.969 --> 1:26:16.404
- Yeah, I'm wondering
where all the white women

1:26:16.404 --> 1:26:18.673
and the cocaine girls

1:26:18.673 --> 1:26:20.141
Eric's a white
collared brother now,

1:26:20.141 --> 1:26:22.744
so we need some of them
white collared party favors.

1:26:22.744 --> 1:26:24.012
You know what I'm saying?

1:26:24.012 --> 1:26:26.714
- Well, I'll take
the white girls

1:26:26.714 --> 1:26:29.651
and you can keep that cocaine.

1:26:29.651 --> 1:26:31.486
- Man, it was a joke, bruh.

1:26:31.486 --> 1:26:32.420
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:33.254
I knew that.

1:26:33.254 --> 1:26:34.088
- You ain't know shit.

1:26:34.088 --> 1:26:34.923
- Deborah.

1:26:34.923 --> 1:26:35.857
- Hey.

1:26:35.857 --> 1:26:36.558
- [Eric] Who's your friend?

1:26:36.558 --> 1:26:37.392
- Bernard, Eric.

1:26:37.392 --> 1:26:38.660
Eric, Bernard.

1:26:38.660 --> 1:26:39.994
- Oh, it's good to
meet you, brother.

1:26:39.994 --> 1:26:40.828
- Hi.

1:26:40.828 --> 1:26:42.897
- Oh this is Alex.

1:26:42.897 --> 1:26:44.399
- How you doing?

1:26:44.399 --> 1:26:48.236
- By the way, my boss
hired a white boy.

1:26:48.236 --> 1:26:49.504
- Ah.

1:26:49.504 --> 1:26:51.005
- But congratulations
on the new job, Eric.

1:26:51.005 --> 1:26:51.973
That's what's up.

1:26:51.973 --> 1:26:52.807
- Thank you.

1:26:52.807 --> 1:26:53.741
Thank you.

1:26:53.741 --> 1:26:55.743
- So how much is it paying?

1:26:55.743 --> 1:26:58.112
- Oh, what Kim means
is that she's looking

1:26:58.112 --> 1:27:00.481
to advance from her current job.

1:27:00.481 --> 1:27:01.983
- Oh, oh yeah.

1:27:01.983 --> 1:27:03.818
Well, let me get a little
more time under my belt

1:27:03.818 --> 1:27:06.554
and then maybe build some
rapport with the key players

1:27:06.554 --> 1:27:08.723
and I can see if there's
some openings for you.

1:27:08.723 --> 1:27:09.958
- Aw, thank you.

1:27:09.958 --> 1:27:11.025
Thank you.

1:27:11.025 --> 1:27:11.893
- [Eric] Yeah, no problem.

1:27:11.893 --> 1:27:13.494
- Don't forget your boy.

1:27:13.494 --> 1:27:15.897
- Oh yeah, no doubt man.

1:27:15.897 --> 1:27:18.232
Well, it's good
to meet you, man.

1:27:18.232 --> 1:27:19.467
- Likewise, brother.

1:27:19.467 --> 1:27:21.469
Y'all keep on
enjoying yourselves.

1:27:21.469 --> 1:27:22.637
Thanks for coming.

1:27:22.637 --> 1:27:23.471
Hey.

1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:27.141
- Cool cats.

1:27:29.110 --> 1:27:31.312
So Kim, you're
still single right?

1:27:31.312 --> 1:27:32.680
- Oh no, no.

1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:33.748
Not my type.

1:27:33.748 --> 1:27:35.083
- [Bernard] Why?

1:27:35.083 --> 1:27:36.451
Too young?

1:27:36.451 --> 1:27:37.785
- No, too broke.

1:27:39.721 --> 1:27:41.055
- You are shameless.

1:27:41.055 --> 1:27:41.889
- What?

1:27:43.858 --> 1:27:45.927
- Now Connie and Jeanine.

1:27:47.228 --> 1:27:49.464
Now with these two
you see right now

1:27:49.464 --> 1:27:51.366
I'm still in the
friendship zone.

1:27:51.366 --> 1:27:55.570
That's only because I brought
up the idea of a threesome.

1:27:55.570 --> 1:27:57.572
I'm still trying though.

1:27:58.606 --> 1:28:01.242
Now if you want, I can cancel.

1:28:01.242 --> 1:28:03.911
Yeah, I mean pick one.

1:28:03.911 --> 1:28:05.246
- I'm good, man.

1:28:06.214 --> 1:28:07.048
You know.

1:28:08.349 --> 1:28:11.419
- Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.

1:28:11.419 --> 1:28:14.422
You're glowing and it's showing.

1:28:14.422 --> 1:28:17.091
You're still thinking
about this wonderful girl

1:28:17.091 --> 1:28:19.027
you've been ranting and
raving about I guess.

1:28:19.027 --> 1:28:23.298
- Yeah well, I guess that's
why I'm so elated, man.

1:28:24.499 --> 1:28:27.201
- But look, why don't
we just at least

1:28:27.201 --> 1:28:30.872
meet these two beautiful,
beautiful young ladies?

1:28:30.872 --> 1:28:33.041
And while you're still
officially singe, it can't hurt.

1:28:33.041 --> 1:28:36.311
- Yeah well, I doubt
I'll change my mind, man.

1:28:36.311 --> 1:28:38.346
This girl special.

1:28:38.346 --> 1:28:39.347
- Come on.

1:28:39.347 --> 1:28:40.682
Connie, Jeanine.

1:28:42.083 --> 1:28:43.384
Connie.

1:28:43.384 --> 1:28:44.252
- Hi.

1:28:44.252 --> 1:28:45.820
- Hello.

1:28:45.820 --> 1:28:46.821
What's up, beautiful?

1:28:46.821 --> 1:28:47.655
- Thank you.

1:28:47.655 --> 1:28:48.823
- And Jeanine.

1:28:52.694 --> 1:28:55.363
This is the man of the hour.

1:28:55.363 --> 1:28:56.764
My good friend, Eric.

1:28:56.764 --> 1:28:57.999
- Nice to meet you, ladies.

1:28:57.999 --> 1:28:59.067
- Nice to meet you, too.

1:28:59.067 --> 1:29:00.568
- Nice to meet you.

1:29:00.568 --> 1:29:02.003
- Nice place you got here.

1:29:02.003 --> 1:29:04.138
- Oh, it's something you know.

1:29:04.138 --> 1:29:05.339
Whatever.

1:29:05.339 --> 1:29:06.441
- Yeah, how long
have you been here?

1:29:06.441 --> 1:29:08.276
- About two years now.

1:29:09.644 --> 1:29:11.846
- Do you know if there's
any other vacancies

1:29:11.846 --> 1:29:14.115
because we're
looking for a place?

1:29:14.115 --> 1:29:15.249
- Yeah.

1:29:15.249 --> 1:29:16.517
- Oh you're roommates?

1:29:16.517 --> 1:29:20.188
- That's what I was
trying to tell you.

1:29:20.188 --> 1:29:21.622
- Oh okay.

1:29:21.622 --> 1:29:25.526
Well, I can talk to the
manager and see what he says.

1:29:25.526 --> 1:29:26.360
- Okay.

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:27.195
- Okay.

1:29:28.463 --> 1:29:30.965
- Connie and Jeanine
are budding actresses.

1:29:30.965 --> 1:29:32.633
- And bartenders by night.

1:29:32.633 --> 1:29:34.702
- [Eric] Oh, dope personalities.

1:29:34.702 --> 1:29:36.204
- [Connie] Yeah.

1:29:36.204 --> 1:29:40.842
- Don't have to be a star,
baby, to be in my show.

1:29:40.842 --> 1:29:43.678
- (laughs) Wow.

1:29:43.678 --> 1:29:45.346
- Alex is a nut.

1:29:45.346 --> 1:29:46.814
- [Eric] Yeah.

1:29:46.814 --> 1:29:50.384
- See we like our guys
more tame and submissive.

1:29:54.222 --> 1:29:55.389
- Oh, oh okay.

1:29:56.224 --> 1:29:57.558
Well, oh shoot.

1:29:57.558 --> 1:29:58.559
I'll get it.

1:30:00.928 --> 1:30:02.330
Nice to meet you.

1:30:05.032 --> 1:30:06.267
Hey, come here.

1:30:09.570 --> 1:30:10.671
You smell so good.

1:30:10.671 --> 1:30:11.873
Come on in, come on in.

1:30:11.873 --> 1:30:12.707
- [Allison] You look nice.

1:30:12.707 --> 1:30:13.674
- Thanks.

1:30:13.674 --> 1:30:14.742
Everybody, everybody.

1:30:14.742 --> 1:30:16.010
This is Allison.

1:30:16.010 --> 1:30:16.844
- Hi.

1:30:16.844 --> 1:30:17.678
- How you doing?

1:30:17.678 --> 1:30:18.513
- Hi guys.

1:30:21.315 --> 1:30:22.150
- Wow.

1:30:25.219 --> 1:30:26.053
Wow.

1:30:28.156 --> 1:30:29.791
Small world.

1:30:29.791 --> 1:30:31.659
- Y'all know each other?

1:30:31.659 --> 1:30:35.163
- [Alex] So this is who
you was so big on, huh?

1:30:35.163 --> 1:30:39.333
I gotta tell you I was expecting
someone a little different.

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:41.969
- Eric, Alex and I used to date.

1:30:44.705 --> 1:30:47.575
- Oh, is that what
you wanna call it?

1:30:47.575 --> 1:30:50.044
Eric, you know how I get down.

1:30:52.213 --> 1:30:54.582
Dog, I don't mean to burst your
bubble or anything like that

1:30:54.582 --> 1:30:57.385
but I used to beat
it up savagely.

1:31:00.021 --> 1:31:03.624
I'm talking I used
to go gorilla on it.

1:31:03.624 --> 1:31:04.459
Just--

1:31:04.459 --> 1:31:06.427
- I get the point, Alex.

1:31:06.427 --> 1:31:07.829
- But she's cool though.

1:31:07.829 --> 1:31:08.763
Yeah, yeah.

1:31:10.298 --> 1:31:11.299
Very giving.

1:31:13.901 --> 1:31:17.038
It's so funny that I'm
not really surprised.

1:31:17.038 --> 1:31:18.873
You know, you guys
on the same level.

1:31:18.873 --> 1:31:22.109
You know, low
self-esteem and all that.

1:31:23.544 --> 1:31:28.149
Aw, did she try that trick on
you yet with the ice cubes?

1:31:29.483 --> 1:31:30.818
- You know what?

1:31:33.554 --> 1:31:38.292
You truly are one arrogant,
self centered son of a bitch.

1:31:39.660 --> 1:31:44.465
One day you gon' find yourself
in life all alone, too.

1:31:45.633 --> 1:31:48.436
Until that day, you
need to get out.

1:31:48.436 --> 1:31:49.437
- [Alex] Get out?

1:31:49.437 --> 1:31:50.738
- Yeah, get out.

1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:56.744
- You gonna mess up
our friendship over
one mediocre chick?

1:31:56.744 --> 1:32:01.649
- Dog, we not friends and
she's definitely not mediocre.

1:32:02.250 --> 1:32:03.050
Now get out.

1:32:10.925 --> 1:32:11.759
- Okay.

1:32:13.694 --> 1:32:15.196
Excuse me, ladies.

1:32:36.918 --> 1:32:39.253
- You used to date that guy?

1:32:42.890 --> 1:32:44.659
That's so disgusting.

1:32:49.897 --> 1:32:53.134
- This is way too
uncomfortable for me.

1:32:54.201 --> 1:32:55.036
I gotta go.

1:32:55.036 --> 1:32:55.836
I'm sorry.

1:32:56.737 --> 1:32:57.538
Sorry.

1:33:03.210 --> 1:33:05.813
(bright music)

1:33:15.456 --> 1:33:16.524
(knocking on door)

1:33:16.524 --> 1:33:17.792
- Party's over.

1:33:17.792 --> 1:33:18.626
Go home.

1:33:24.799 --> 1:33:25.633
- Hey.

1:33:27.234 --> 1:33:28.069
- Allison.

1:33:29.570 --> 1:33:30.404
Hey.

1:33:32.173 --> 1:33:34.442
I didn't expect you back here.

1:33:34.442 --> 1:33:38.612
- Well, I figured you guys
might still be partying

1:33:39.947 --> 1:33:44.218
and I felt guilty about
running out that way.

1:33:44.218 --> 1:33:45.052
- Oh.

1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:49.123
I mean, everybody pretty much

1:33:49.123 --> 1:33:54.028
left not too long after
you, after you walked out.

1:33:54.028 --> 1:33:55.596
It was a pretty awkward moment.

1:33:55.596 --> 1:33:58.566
- Look, I wanna
apologize to you.

1:33:58.566 --> 1:34:00.201
- For what?

1:34:00.201 --> 1:34:02.269
You didn't do anything.

1:34:02.269 --> 1:34:06.107
- For my association
with my former associate.

1:34:09.343 --> 1:34:11.045
I was vulnerable.

1:34:11.045 --> 1:34:12.480
I hit a very low point back then

1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:14.815
when I was dealing with him.

1:34:18.152 --> 1:34:20.154
It was not me, you know.

1:34:25.359 --> 1:34:26.694
- You know what?

1:34:27.862 --> 1:34:30.998
Former and associate
are two good words

1:34:32.867 --> 1:34:36.937
to probably describe my
relationship with him, too.

1:34:36.937 --> 1:34:38.272
I mean, hey you know.

1:34:38.272 --> 1:34:39.940
We met for a reason.

1:34:41.142 --> 1:34:44.879
And I think I can move
on past it if you can.

1:34:46.147 --> 1:34:47.648
- I'm way past it.

1:34:49.083 --> 1:34:53.687
I just I look at it as killing
time until I met the person

1:34:54.855 --> 1:34:56.857
that I really wanted
to spend my time with.

1:34:56.857 --> 1:34:57.691
Hint hint.

1:35:01.595 --> 1:35:03.431
- My thoughts exactly.

1:35:06.567 --> 1:35:09.904
I mean, 'cause every woman
has a dog in her life

1:35:09.904 --> 1:35:11.639
and our mutt is Alex.

1:35:13.808 --> 1:35:17.712
- Alright well, let's
forget about the past

1:35:17.712 --> 1:35:20.047
and move on into the future.

1:35:21.048 --> 1:35:22.049
Cool?
- Cool.

1:35:23.984 --> 1:35:24.952
Cool.

1:35:24.952 --> 1:35:26.554
- Cool.

1:35:26.554 --> 1:35:27.788
- Future it is.

1:35:37.798 --> 1:35:39.633
I'll get that for you.

1:35:47.141 --> 1:35:50.478
You know before we
move into the future,

1:35:52.179 --> 1:35:54.348
I gotta ask you something.

1:35:55.549 --> 1:35:56.383
- Okay.

1:36:01.489 --> 1:36:04.225
- Could you help me
clean this place up?

1:36:04.225 --> 1:36:05.926
- (laughs) Yeah.

1:36:05.926 --> 1:36:07.294
Yes, I can.

1:36:07.294 --> 1:36:09.063
Let go of that first.

1:36:11.065 --> 1:36:12.266
Where are your trash bags?

1:36:12.266 --> 1:36:13.300
- They're in the kitchen.

1:36:13.300 --> 1:36:14.135
- Alright, I'll go.

1:36:14.135 --> 1:36:16.103
- No, I'll get 'em.

1:36:16.103 --> 1:36:17.771
We can get 'em together.

1:36:17.771 --> 1:36:19.406
Come on.
