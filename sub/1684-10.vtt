WEBVTT

00:00.665 --> 00:02.667
The question is...

00:02.668 --> 00:04.636
who am I?

00:04.637 --> 00:06.104
Right.

00:06.105 --> 00:09.130
I give you a clue, you
have a minute to guess

00:09.131 --> 00:10.865
the identity of the person in question.

00:10.866 --> 00:13.601
We must find a weapon to defeat Moloch.

00:13.602 --> 00:17.104
I fail to understand how
a game played on telephones

00:17.105 --> 00:19.340
will help us solve our
dire problem at hand.

00:19.341 --> 00:20.474
It won't.

00:20.475 --> 00:21.575
That's the point.

00:21.576 --> 00:22.843
This is a technique

00:22.844 --> 00:24.445
profilers use to crack cases

00:24.446 --> 00:25.679
when they're stuck.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.881
If you distract the conscious mind,

00:26.882 --> 00:28.149
the subconscious makes connections

00:28.150 --> 00:29.583
that you wouldn't have seen before.

00:29.584 --> 00:30.851
My mother believed

00:30.852 --> 00:32.552
that Grace Dixon hid some clues

00:32.554 --> 00:34.021
in her journal. We've gone over it

00:34.022 --> 00:35.789
so many times, you
practically memorized it,

00:35.790 --> 00:37.224
and still nada.

00:37.225 --> 00:38.859
So...

00:38.860 --> 00:40.227
you cannot tell a lie.

00:40.228 --> 00:42.429
Who are you?

00:42.430 --> 00:43.531
Oh! Oh!

00:43.532 --> 00:44.798
The little wooden puppet boy.

00:44.799 --> 00:46.834
- Pinocchio?
- Yeah.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.535
Nope. Guess again.

00:50.338 --> 00:52.106
George Washington?

00:52.107 --> 00:55.609
He was our Liar-in-Chief.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.711
He formed the Culper Spy Ring.

00:57.712 --> 00:59.246
That was a network of liars.

00:59.247 --> 01:01.815
Thank you, colonial myth buster.

01:01.816 --> 01:04.150
Ichabod.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.954
Katrina?

01:06.955 --> 01:08.722
Ichabod, can you hear me?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.392
Crane, there. The mirror.

01:15.197 --> 01:16.330
My love.

01:16.331 --> 01:18.365
- Are you in danger?
- I'm safe for now.

01:18.366 --> 01:21.101
But if Henry finds me using
this glass to speak to you, I...

01:21.102 --> 01:22.770
I failed my mission.

01:22.771 --> 01:25.205
Moloch still lives.

01:26.841 --> 01:28.873
- What happened?
- He's grown too strong.

01:28.874 --> 01:30.678
And I fear with the rate he matures,

01:30.679 --> 01:33.814
he-he could reign this Earth
in less than two days time.

01:33.815 --> 01:35.182
There is still another chance.

01:35.183 --> 01:37.384
Another way has presented itself.

01:37.385 --> 01:41.255
There is a weapon capable
of defeating Moloch.

01:41.256 --> 01:42.656
We could use your insights.

01:43.592 --> 01:44.925
What was that?

01:44.926 --> 01:46.260
I must go.

01:46.261 --> 01:49.763
No, no, Katri... Wait! Wai...

01:53.635 --> 01:56.236
We need to find the weapon.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.088 --> 02:14.488
There is still a chance.

02:14.489 --> 02:17.124
Another way has presented itself.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.626
We'll go through it again.

02:18.627 --> 02:20.628
It has to be a code; these
words are very specific.

02:20.629 --> 02:23.964
Chosen words.

02:23.965 --> 02:27.167
Of course.

02:27.168 --> 02:28.894
It seems my wife's appearance has provided

02:28.895 --> 02:31.005
a more potent distraction
than your parlor game.

02:31.006 --> 02:33.007
You're just mad because you lost.

02:33.008 --> 02:35.042
Grace's notes.

02:35.043 --> 02:37.645
Here. "Heed the chosen
words of the Watchers."

02:37.646 --> 02:40.781
Demons are fallen angels,

02:40.782 --> 02:42.616
another word for which

02:42.617 --> 02:43.817
are "watchers."

02:43.818 --> 02:45.152
So we're searching for

02:45.153 --> 02:47.721
the "chosen words" of fallen angels.

02:50.058 --> 02:51.859
Brilliant.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.994
- Thank you.
- Not you, Grace's code.

02:53.995 --> 02:56.830
Oh, oh. You have your moments as well.

02:56.831 --> 02:59.500
- Too late.
- Right.

03:01.903 --> 03:04.838
"Chosen words" is an anagram.

03:04.839 --> 03:06.262
When rearranged, it spells out...

03:06.263 --> 03:09.543
"Enoch's Sword."

03:09.544 --> 03:11.412
Could it be

03:11.413 --> 03:12.713
a literal sword?

03:12.714 --> 03:15.082
Enoch is an ancient Hebrew text.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.985
I saw a copy of it here somewhere.

03:21.122 --> 03:22.723
I got an alert.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.058
Sheriff Reyes

03:24.059 --> 03:25.559
is coordinating with state police

03:25.560 --> 03:26.660
to catch Irving.

03:26.661 --> 03:27.868
Miss Jenny was to have

03:27.869 --> 03:29.963
delivered him safely
across the Canadian border.

03:29.964 --> 03:31.765
I have no idea how far she got.

03:31.766 --> 03:34.301
I have to warn her.

03:40.308 --> 03:43.177
Abbie says they're setting
up checkpoints all the way

03:43.178 --> 03:45.612
along 87, 81 and the side roads.

03:45.613 --> 03:48.349
We got to get you across the border fast.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.384
No texting while driving.

03:51.619 --> 03:52.986
Always the cop.

03:52.987 --> 03:55.989
I did all this for my family.

03:58.159 --> 04:00.661
I know I can't see them, but...

04:01.930 --> 04:03.197
They don't know the truth.

04:03.198 --> 04:05.199
You'll see them again.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.935
And we're gonna find a
way to reclaim your soul,

04:07.936 --> 04:10.671
but first, we have to get you to safety.

04:14.242 --> 04:16.777
You really think anywhere is safe anymore?

04:16.778 --> 04:19.446
Yeah.

04:19.447 --> 04:21.781
I have to.

04:25.620 --> 04:28.856
As far as I can tell, Irving and Jenny

04:28.857 --> 04:30.324
are still okay for now.

04:30.325 --> 04:32.292
You find anything here?

04:32.293 --> 04:33.927
In the Book of Enoch,

04:33.928 --> 04:35.729
there is the legend of Methuselah.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.431
He was given a sword

04:37.432 --> 04:40.134
with the power to kill any being on Earth.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.869
He used it to take down

04:41.870 --> 04:43.370
a thousand demons.

04:43.371 --> 04:45.873
So Mama was right. The
sword can kill Moloch.

04:45.874 --> 04:47.841
If it can be found.

04:47.842 --> 04:49.977
But it all fits.

04:49.978 --> 04:51.779
She wrote it down.

04:51.780 --> 04:54.014
It's got to be here somewhere

04:54.015 --> 04:55.182
in this journal.

04:55.183 --> 04:56.784
Wait a minute,

04:56.785 --> 04:58.085
go back to that drawing.

04:58.086 --> 04:59.753
The reflection.

04:59.754 --> 05:03.290
There is an arts technique
called mirror anamorphosis.

05:03.291 --> 05:06.893
The distortion of an image...

05:08.963 --> 05:11.865
...to disguise it.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.835
A snake.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.703
I know that drawing.

05:16.704 --> 05:18.972
"Join or Die."

05:18.973 --> 05:22.042
It was a famous political cartoon.

05:23.378 --> 05:25.479
America's first, actually.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.817
Supposedly designed to unite the colonies.

05:29.818 --> 05:32.419
Drawn by Ben Franklin.

05:33.288 --> 05:35.555
It's more than that.

05:36.925 --> 05:39.460
Look at this.

05:39.461 --> 05:42.429
Right there.

05:43.064 --> 05:44.832
The river.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.534
The snake's tongue marks a spot.

05:49.337 --> 05:52.105
Like a treasure map.

05:54.209 --> 05:57.311
So, perhaps Franklin, knowing the colonists

05:57.312 --> 06:00.214
might need an ultimate weapon against evil,

06:00.215 --> 06:02.516
published a "Join or Die" cartoon

06:02.517 --> 06:05.252
as a message to all Freemasons.

06:05.253 --> 06:08.922
That the Sword of Methuselah is here...

06:08.923 --> 06:11.324
in the New World.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.594
Let's go get it.

06:13.595 --> 06:15.095
Lieutenant.

06:15.096 --> 06:17.064
- Yes?
- Our quest

06:17.065 --> 06:18.665
will not be without peril.

06:18.666 --> 06:21.301
Crane, you and I can't
have lunch without peril.

06:21.302 --> 06:22.803
No.

06:22.804 --> 06:23.904
Look at this.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.406
"Know thyself completely

06:26.407 --> 06:28.108
or perish when you attempt to see."

06:28.109 --> 06:30.477
This prophecy says we will definitely die,

06:30.478 --> 06:33.747
unless we both know ourselves completely.

06:33.748 --> 06:35.115
I know this.

06:35.116 --> 06:39.152
That journal was passed down
from my ancestor to my mother.

06:39.153 --> 06:40.921
Now to me.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.489
It is my legacy.

06:42.490 --> 06:44.531
Maybe all the suffering,
everything I've gone through,

06:44.532 --> 06:45.325
leads up to this.

06:45.326 --> 06:46.894
A chance to finally

06:46.895 --> 06:49.429
finish what my family started.

06:49.430 --> 06:52.099
It is why I'm here.

06:53.067 --> 06:57.170
Clarity of purpose is such a rare gift.

07:08.316 --> 07:11.785
Allowing Katrina to contact
Ichabod through the mirror

07:11.786 --> 07:14.388
has paid dividends.

07:14.389 --> 07:17.224
He seeks the Sword of Methuselah.

07:17.225 --> 07:19.860
The Witnesses must not
get their hands on it.

07:19.861 --> 07:21.562
You will follow them,

07:21.563 --> 07:23.597
and if they discover its resting place,

07:23.598 --> 07:26.033
you will retrieve it before they do.

07:26.034 --> 07:27.134
The hour is late.

07:27.135 --> 07:29.836
And morning brings daylight.

07:29.837 --> 07:35.842
Then I suggest you don't waste
another minute of the darkness.

07:35.843 --> 07:38.178
Ride!

08:09.310 --> 08:14.676
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:18.275 --> 08:19.942
Abraham!

08:19.943 --> 08:21.511
You leaving so soon?

08:21.512 --> 08:23.613
You've only just arrived.

08:23.614 --> 08:26.082
Do not try to distract
me from the task at hand.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.149
No, it's just that

08:28.150 --> 08:30.551
there are so many things I
want to talk to you about.

08:30.552 --> 08:34.554
I should think you might have
had your fill of talk tonight.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.758
You were once my greatest treasure,

08:37.759 --> 08:39.559
and Crane stole you from me.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.261
But now he seeks a new treasure,

08:41.263 --> 08:43.197
and this time, I will take it first.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.532
And when I return, you and I

08:44.533 --> 08:46.467
will celebrate Moloch's rise.

08:49.171 --> 08:51.705
Ichabod, be strong.

08:55.978 --> 08:58.946
Oh, no. Checkpoint.

09:00.115 --> 09:02.950
This isn't one of the
roads Abbie mentioned.

09:02.951 --> 09:04.986
They're widening the net
fast. Get in the back,

09:04.987 --> 09:07.054
- under the tarp.
- No, let me out of the car.

09:07.055 --> 09:08.723
Just do it; I've talked my way past plenty

09:08.724 --> 09:10.071
of cops at plenty of
checkpoints in my life.

09:10.072 --> 09:12.293
Not with a fugitive in the back, Jenny.

09:12.294 --> 09:13.961
You will go to jail.

09:13.962 --> 09:17.298
I can't have any more
people get hurt. It's enough.

09:21.570 --> 09:23.437
Take this burner phone.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.940
Cross through the trees.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.759
I'll meet you at the bridge on Route 21.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.510
Then I'm taking you to Canada.

09:29.511 --> 09:31.045
Deal.

09:31.046 --> 09:33.747
Be careful. I can't slow down all the way.

09:48.931 --> 09:50.865
We're all out of snake's tongue.

09:50.866 --> 09:53.567
Sword's got to be here somewhere.

09:59.274 --> 10:01.275
Lieutenant?

10:01.276 --> 10:03.577
What is it?

10:05.614 --> 10:06.814
I've been here.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.317
As a child?

10:09.318 --> 10:10.751
In my dream.

10:10.752 --> 10:14.522
♪ You are my sunshine ♪

10:14.523 --> 10:19.060
♪ My only sunshine ♪

10:19.061 --> 10:20.428
♪ You make me happy... ♪

10:20.429 --> 10:21.529
Mama?

10:21.530 --> 10:23.030
The one of Mama in Purgatory.

10:23.031 --> 10:25.333
This is where we were.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.735
She's been trying to
lead me here all along.

10:30.639 --> 10:32.306
Lieutenant!

11:00.736 --> 11:02.803
How did he find us?

11:02.804 --> 11:05.439
Followed us here, no doubt.

11:07.743 --> 11:09.844
I don't think it's us he wants.

11:09.845 --> 11:12.313
He's after the sword.

11:13.815 --> 11:15.483
Don't!

11:15.484 --> 11:18.118
Patience, Lieutenant.

11:18.987 --> 11:22.957
Daybreak will solve our problem for us.

11:22.958 --> 11:25.693
Not if he takes the sword first.

11:25.694 --> 11:27.127
Wait!

12:45.774 --> 12:48.275
Abraham van Brunt!

13:13.168 --> 13:16.003
Good morning, sunshine.

13:46.234 --> 13:50.337
You telling me you knew
exactly when the sun would rise?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.440
Did you read the stars or something?

13:53.441 --> 13:56.243
You installed a weather application for me.

13:56.244 --> 13:59.346
It also foretells a 15%
chance of precipitation.

13:59.347 --> 14:00.481
Okay.

14:00.482 --> 14:03.984
So... the Horseman's joined the party.

14:03.985 --> 14:05.219
We got a day's head start

14:05.220 --> 14:07.121
to find that sword.

14:07.122 --> 14:09.290
Yet it troubles me, Lieutenant.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.258
For Abraham to become

14:11.259 --> 14:14.561
an obstacle now, at this critical point...

14:15.263 --> 14:17.765
"Know thyself," indeed.

14:17.766 --> 14:19.166
What do you mean?

14:19.167 --> 14:20.534
That my journey for the sword

14:20.535 --> 14:22.536
must inevitably pass through Abraham.

14:22.537 --> 14:25.305
As has my life's journey to this point.

14:26.841 --> 14:28.943
Whoever I may be now,

14:28.944 --> 14:32.045
I owe my very identity to him.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.649
America, Ichabod. Think on it.

14:35.650 --> 14:37.885
A new world, there...

14:37.886 --> 14:40.087
for the taking.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.957
You mock me, Abraham.

14:42.958 --> 14:44.325
You know I cannot simply

14:44.326 --> 14:45.992
resign my professorship to follow you

14:45.993 --> 14:47.995
- to the colonies.
- I thought university

14:47.996 --> 14:50.464
was your father's path, not yours.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.101
I'll choose my own path, thank you.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.402
Perhaps.

14:55.403 --> 14:56.971
I know old Thomas would never support

14:56.972 --> 14:58.539
such a move, but join the army.

14:58.540 --> 15:01.041
Let the Crown pay your
way. I beg you, my friend.

15:01.042 --> 15:03.143
Whatever it takes, act.
For once in your life,

15:03.144 --> 15:05.512
become your own man!

15:11.853 --> 15:13.787
Whatever man I may be,

15:13.788 --> 15:17.424
Abraham, I'm still your better.

15:18.393 --> 15:21.662
Toy swords, pretend fighting.

15:21.663 --> 15:24.231
But come test yourself in
the real world, and decide...

15:24.232 --> 15:27.835
were you meant to teach
history or to make it?

15:29.404 --> 15:34.408
And now the swords are very real indeed.

15:34.409 --> 15:35.976
Don't you see, Lieutenant?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.845
Abraham made me

15:37.846 --> 15:39.213
who I am.

15:39.214 --> 15:42.749
Our journeys are entwined,
our fates ever so.

15:43.652 --> 15:48.088
And now he, too, is on
the quest for the sword.

15:48.089 --> 15:50.024
You're saying the prophecy's real.

15:50.025 --> 15:51.992
Self-fulfilling.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.695
We shall meet in battle again.

15:54.696 --> 15:58.599
Only this time, he's the Horseman of Death.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.836
And I must know myself completely...

16:02.837 --> 16:04.782
or perish.

16:05.957 --> 16:09.783
So, the Headless Horseman
inspired you to come to America.

16:09.805 --> 16:11.539
You couldn't have had any other friends

16:11.540 --> 16:13.341
egging you to come over here?

16:13.342 --> 16:16.043
Maybe someone without an axe?

16:16.044 --> 16:18.646
The Knights Templar foretold a quest,

16:18.647 --> 16:21.282
not only for the sword,
but into one's self.

16:21.283 --> 16:23.351
And now...

16:23.352 --> 16:26.487
I am challenged by the very
man who shaped my destiny.

16:26.488 --> 16:28.456
That's going a little far, isn't it?

16:28.457 --> 16:31.325
Abraham may have given you
the idea to come to America,

16:31.326 --> 16:33.294
but you put in action.

16:33.295 --> 16:37.264
Well, I wish that were the case.

16:37.265 --> 16:38.766
But Abraham's influence

16:38.767 --> 16:42.403
has been both crucial and definitive

16:42.404 --> 16:44.939
at every turn.

16:45.674 --> 16:48.743
My friend, you have made a bold choice.

16:48.744 --> 16:51.445
And, in doing so, I
have deserted my nation.

16:51.446 --> 16:52.713
The country that stifled you,

16:52.714 --> 16:54.115
held you back,

16:54.116 --> 16:56.250
repressed the spirit of a free nation.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.284
Breathe in

16:57.285 --> 16:59.553
the new world's fresh air.

16:59.554 --> 17:00.755
It is all possibility.

17:00.756 --> 17:02.423
You need only reach out and grab it.

17:02.424 --> 17:03.858
And soon,

17:03.859 --> 17:06.160
you'll be like me, with
a place of distinction

17:06.161 --> 17:09.163
and a bed fully furnished
with a buxom woman.

17:09.731 --> 17:11.531
And, more importantly,

17:11.532 --> 17:13.133
a friend...

17:14.403 --> 17:15.970
...willing to pick up the tab.

17:15.971 --> 17:17.938
You...

17:20.976 --> 17:22.576
What'll it be, friend?

17:22.577 --> 17:25.512
One beer and one generous rum.

17:25.513 --> 17:27.047
Straightaway, sir.

17:32.187 --> 17:33.954
Miss Van Tassel.

17:33.955 --> 17:36.890
If it isn't Mr. Ichabod Crane.

17:37.793 --> 17:40.394
Officially shed of your red coat?

17:40.395 --> 17:42.396
Uh, yes.

17:42.397 --> 17:45.332
I believe the new one will
suit you so much better.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.767
Oh, Katrina!

17:46.768 --> 17:49.303
My darling!

17:50.505 --> 17:52.373
Hello, Bram.

17:52.374 --> 17:53.707
The blush in your cheeks

17:53.708 --> 17:55.443
tells me you've been enjoying your evening.

17:55.444 --> 17:56.640
Well, how could I not,

17:56.641 --> 17:58.402
after reuniting with my dearest of friends?

17:58.403 --> 18:00.414
Uh, you two have met?

18:00.415 --> 18:02.716
Briefly, in Boston.

18:02.717 --> 18:04.819
Well, what serendipity!

18:04.820 --> 18:06.954
You must join us at my estate this weekend.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.091
I have a feeling you two
will be thick as thieves.

18:13.695 --> 18:17.031
Abraham cajoled me into coming to America,

18:17.032 --> 18:19.700
Katrina influenced my
turn, put me to sleep,

18:19.701 --> 18:22.636
sent me on my mission to become a Witness.

18:22.637 --> 18:24.438
How do I know myself

18:24.439 --> 18:27.875
when at every turn my life
has been determined by others?

18:27.876 --> 18:30.911
I've struggled with that
for a long time, Crane.

18:32.114 --> 18:34.615
Now I have the journal and a destiny.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.217
I've got to believe

18:36.218 --> 18:37.818
that there's a reason why I'm worthy

18:37.819 --> 18:40.454
of this path that life has set out for us.

18:40.455 --> 18:41.455
So do you.

18:41.456 --> 18:43.824
Of course.

18:43.825 --> 18:46.327
We did not come this far to retreat now.

18:46.328 --> 18:49.130
- But...
- Mm.

18:49.131 --> 18:53.467
Abraham took the clue we
needed to find the sword.

18:53.468 --> 18:56.337
I got a look at it. Um...

18:56.338 --> 18:59.073
it was a... a plaque,

18:59.074 --> 19:02.576
with a circle.

19:02.577 --> 19:04.111
Like this.

19:04.112 --> 19:06.413
Ouroboros.

19:06.414 --> 19:09.683
A snake eating its tail.

19:09.684 --> 19:13.721
It embodies the motto
of the Knights Templar.

19:13.722 --> 19:15.656
"As above, so below."

19:15.657 --> 19:18.792
The connection between heaven and Earth.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.828
As above, so below.

19:20.829 --> 19:21.929
That's right.

19:21.930 --> 19:24.965
Microcosm to macrocosm.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.601
Heaven and Earth.

19:27.602 --> 19:30.137
Or, if we're being literal...

19:30.138 --> 19:32.740
as above...

19:32.741 --> 19:35.008
Below.

20:03.338 --> 20:04.672
Ouroboros.

20:04.673 --> 20:06.473
Nice work, Mama.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.716
You, show me your hands, right now!

20:56.324 --> 20:58.625
What the hell?

21:08.536 --> 21:11.805
An Englishman?

21:19.414 --> 21:22.583
Who put a bunch of stone statues down here?

21:28.423 --> 21:30.357
What's wrong?

21:32.761 --> 21:34.795
The resemblance is uncanny.

21:45.407 --> 21:47.641
"Dixon."

21:47.642 --> 21:49.643
That's Grace's last name.

21:51.079 --> 21:53.353
The clothing is, uh, early 19th century.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.015
This must've been one of her daughters

21:55.016 --> 21:56.583
or granddaughters or something.

21:56.584 --> 21:58.152
Why a statue?

21:58.153 --> 22:00.854
I fear this is no statue,

22:00.855 --> 22:04.325
but a real person

22:04.326 --> 22:06.460
turned to stone.

22:07.462 --> 22:10.264
As they all are.

22:13.935 --> 22:15.903
Crane, what is that?

22:15.904 --> 22:17.538
We need to leave.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.207
Now. Quickly.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.710
Don't look back. Do not look back!

22:22.711 --> 22:25.279
Go! Go! Don't look!

22:27.482 --> 22:28.849
Oh, God...

22:30.184 --> 22:32.260
What the hell was that thing down there?!

22:32.261 --> 22:33.463
A monster that I thought

22:33.464 --> 22:36.666
existed only in the
pages of Greek mythology.

22:37.540 --> 22:39.369
A Gorgon.

22:39.370 --> 22:42.039
Cursed with the power to turn us to stone

22:42.040 --> 22:44.107
if we dare but meet its gaze.

22:44.108 --> 22:47.143
That's the next line in the prophecy.

22:47.712 --> 22:49.046
"Know thyself completely

22:49.047 --> 22:51.081
or you will perish when
you attempt to see."

22:51.082 --> 22:56.286
Those explorers from
all times and cultures...

22:56.287 --> 22:58.121
they were looking for this weapon.

22:58.122 --> 23:01.325
Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese.

23:01.326 --> 23:03.827
My God.

23:03.828 --> 23:05.495
The very founding of the New World

23:05.496 --> 23:09.032
could've been but a by-product
in the search for the sword.

23:09.033 --> 23:11.601
That's what you took away
from what we just saw?

23:13.071 --> 23:15.359
Lieutenant, I understand
that seeing your ancestor

23:15.360 --> 23:16.940
in that cavern would not have be easy...

23:16.941 --> 23:19.309
My God, she was frozen in stone!

23:19.310 --> 23:21.845
Dead before she could complete her mission.

23:21.846 --> 23:24.014
Like so many of the women in my family,

23:24.015 --> 23:25.382
cut down in their prime...

23:25.383 --> 23:28.552
Grace burned alive, Mama driven to suicide.

23:29.654 --> 23:32.289
Is it my destiny to die here, too?

23:32.290 --> 23:33.657
No. No.

23:33.658 --> 23:35.025
Banish that thought, Lieutenant.

23:35.026 --> 23:38.628
You are here to finish what they started.

23:38.629 --> 23:39.796
You said it yourself.

23:39.797 --> 23:42.532
That is your destiny.

23:42.533 --> 23:45.602
Moloch is on Earth.

23:45.603 --> 23:47.838
Katrina is in captivity.

23:47.839 --> 23:50.240
And, yeah, we are so close to having

23:50.241 --> 23:52.309
what we need to end this thing.

23:52.310 --> 23:55.679
But it's guarded by a creature
that we can't even lay eyes on.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.281
We must remain steadfast.

23:58.282 --> 23:59.149
Mm.

23:59.150 --> 24:01.351
Face our fears as we always do.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.752
"Face our fears."

24:06.124 --> 24:09.225
Maybe we don't have to.

24:10.027 --> 24:12.929
Maybe someone else can face them for us.

24:12.930 --> 24:14.564
I don't follow.

24:14.565 --> 24:18.235
Locking eyes with the Gorgon
turns a person to stone.

24:18.236 --> 24:21.805
We can't even get near enough to kill it.

24:21.806 --> 24:23.540
Maybe...

24:23.541 --> 24:26.209
someone with no eyes can.

24:26.210 --> 24:29.379
Oh.

24:41.759 --> 24:43.260
Sorry, Jenny.

24:43.261 --> 24:46.396
Thank you for trying,
but I can't run and hide.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.864
Not who I am.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.800
I'm gonna fight, stay underground.

24:49.801 --> 24:54.204
When I see you again, I
hope it's in a better world.

25:10.955 --> 25:13.156
It's the shofar.

25:13.157 --> 25:15.492
The trumpet that made

25:15.493 --> 25:18.395
the Israelites tremble at Mount Sinai.

25:18.396 --> 25:21.465
That brought down the walls of Jericho.

25:21.466 --> 25:24.568
That has signaled the starting of wars

25:24.569 --> 25:26.937
for aeons.

25:26.938 --> 25:29.606
And now is to sound the moment

25:29.607 --> 25:33.210
that Moloch has grown to his full glory,

25:33.211 --> 25:37.647
to call his servants to his side.

25:39.116 --> 25:41.451
It's nice to see that you've
taken up an instrument.

25:41.452 --> 25:44.821
Perhaps after dinner tonight,
we can have a recital.

25:44.822 --> 25:46.022
Yes.

25:46.023 --> 25:48.491
Yes, we will.

25:49.961 --> 25:53.096
And what would you like for tonight's meal?

25:53.097 --> 25:56.199
It's customary for the
condemned to have a choice.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.236
Well, if you're worried
about the food, don't be.

25:59.237 --> 26:02.172
I would never poison

26:02.173 --> 26:04.240
my own flesh and blood.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.089
They grow up so quickly.

26:19.090 --> 26:20.757
I hesitated.

26:20.758 --> 26:22.359
I was a fool.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.728
As always, your compassion
is your weakness.

26:24.729 --> 26:28.899
And now, ironically,
despite all your efforts,

26:28.900 --> 26:31.401
it is also your husband's.

26:31.402 --> 26:34.137
And what have you done to Ichabod?

26:34.138 --> 26:35.605
It's you that did it.

26:35.606 --> 26:37.941
The moment I allowed you

26:37.942 --> 26:40.043
to contact him through my mirror.

26:40.044 --> 26:43.346
You see yourself as strong.

26:43.347 --> 26:46.850
A witch, a spy, a wife.

26:46.851 --> 26:49.886
But your humanity always emerges

26:49.887 --> 26:52.422
time and time again to define you.

26:52.423 --> 26:57.360
You're only here because
of my most human quality.

26:57.361 --> 26:58.595
Love.

26:58.596 --> 27:00.030
It is, after all,

27:00.031 --> 27:02.866
what led me to save your life
when the coven wanted you dead.

27:02.867 --> 27:05.635
You wouldn't have needed to save me

27:05.636 --> 27:09.773
if you had the strength
to let your husband die.

27:10.541 --> 27:13.577
You could've prevented all this.

27:13.578 --> 27:16.379
You could've been a mother to the child

27:16.380 --> 27:18.848
you gave birth to in this very house.

27:18.849 --> 27:20.650
A human child.

27:20.651 --> 27:24.287
You cannot deny that humanity within you.

27:24.288 --> 27:30.193
I can and I do with my every breath.

27:30.194 --> 27:34.030
Breath that will soon
blow this horn three times

27:34.031 --> 27:37.834
to announce the start of the End Times.

27:39.704 --> 27:42.472
But first...

27:42.473 --> 27:44.874
let me lift this enchantment,

27:44.875 --> 27:49.679
so you can see what your
compassion has yielded.

28:13.871 --> 28:16.139
Just me.

28:18.643 --> 28:20.477
I made torches.

28:20.478 --> 28:22.445
Fashioned my socks into batting,

28:22.446 --> 28:25.915
and soaked them in pitch I
dug from a new pine bough.

28:25.916 --> 28:27.784
I brought flares.

28:27.785 --> 28:29.719
Just light them.

28:30.955 --> 28:32.322
Well...

28:32.323 --> 28:35.191
one can never have enough torches.

28:37.762 --> 28:39.863
I cannot believe we're actually hoping

28:39.864 --> 28:42.465
the Horseman of Death shows up.

28:42.466 --> 28:44.234
Your plan is a sound one.

28:44.235 --> 28:46.736
Doesn't make it any less nuts.

28:46.737 --> 28:48.605
Lure the Headless
Horseman to follow us down

28:48.606 --> 28:51.775
into a secret cavern ruled by a Gorgon,

28:51.776 --> 28:53.677
where His Headlessness
has the fight advantage.

28:53.678 --> 28:56.379
Meanwhile, we find a magic sword to kill

28:56.380 --> 28:57.781
the Horseman when he comes after us,

28:57.782 --> 29:01.618
which then we use to stop Moloch's rise.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.554
Did I miss anything?

29:04.555 --> 29:07.090
Did you say don't look at the Gorgon?

29:07.091 --> 29:10.660
I was hoping that was implied.

29:10.661 --> 29:16.066
If she were here now, your
mother would be very proud.

29:26.077 --> 29:27.243
Lieutenant!

29:27.244 --> 29:29.212
Quickly! He comes!

30:07.918 --> 30:10.887
Don't tell me you're trying to
take a selfie with the Gorgon.

30:14.091 --> 30:16.659
Go now. Go.

30:22.767 --> 30:25.101
See? Torches.

30:26.303 --> 30:28.638
You're welcome.

30:42.686 --> 30:43.920
Now...

30:43.921 --> 30:48.091
we must determine which is the true sword.

30:48.092 --> 30:49.692
Right.

30:49.693 --> 30:52.261
'Cause getting here
just wasn't hard enough.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.537
It is one these swords right?

31:05.538 --> 31:07.672
'Cause if it's not and I die in here,

31:07.673 --> 31:10.275
I'll be kicking some serious
Templar ass in the afterlife.

31:10.276 --> 31:11.510
You find the sword.

31:11.511 --> 31:13.478
I shall hold off the victor in battle.

31:13.479 --> 31:15.580
No, Crane. Not by
yourself. You'll be killed.

31:15.581 --> 31:17.215
Even both of us together against them

31:17.216 --> 31:19.384
does not appreciably narrow our odds.

31:19.385 --> 31:20.652
Not without the sword.

31:20.653 --> 31:22.120
I'll buy you as much time as I can.

31:22.121 --> 31:25.190
But you must find it, posthaste.

31:29.662 --> 31:31.763
And bear in mind, it might be a test.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.565
You may only get one chance.

31:33.566 --> 31:36.801
Awesome. Thanks for that.

32:07.033 --> 32:09.300
Ichabod!

32:13.072 --> 32:15.573
Abraham.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.044
I can see you.

32:19.045 --> 32:21.246
So the prophecy of the
sword is as Henry said.

32:21.247 --> 32:24.849
Everyone within these chambers
must wear their truest face.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.451
"Know thyself,

32:26.452 --> 32:28.453
completely."

32:28.454 --> 32:32.624
You've forgotten the part about perishing!

32:32.625 --> 32:35.627
When I look at you, I see
the face of my betrayer.

32:35.628 --> 32:41.333
The face of a man I have
long dreamed of cutting down.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.467
Without honor?!

32:42.468 --> 32:44.469
Huh, Abraham?

32:44.470 --> 32:48.173
You bested me when we dueled over Katrina

32:48.174 --> 32:50.842
in the forest many years ago.

32:50.843 --> 32:54.579
Our bloody combat on the battlefield...

32:54.580 --> 32:57.081
we'll call that a draw.

32:58.217 --> 33:02.821
And now will you not grant me
the honor of a deciding match?

33:36.589 --> 33:38.556
It would seem, my old friend,

33:38.557 --> 33:42.427
that our story is ever
to be told by swordplay.

33:43.996 --> 33:45.897
And this will be our final chapter.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.466
Then I will use your
blood to write, "Finis."

33:55.708 --> 33:58.376
I want redemption for you, Abraham,

33:58.377 --> 34:00.545
yet all I see is the ghost

34:00.546 --> 34:02.447
of a man I once knew.

34:02.448 --> 34:06.017
Well, Ichabod, that is because I am dead!

34:09.255 --> 34:11.956
Your path was on course already,

34:11.956 --> 34:15.260
towards this creature of
darkness you've become.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.395
I am what you made me!

34:20.900 --> 34:25.670
I am the one who traveled to the
New World to forge a new path.

34:25.670 --> 34:27.871
You forced your way onto it.

34:27.873 --> 34:29.040
I found a wife.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.742
You stole her from me!

34:30.743 --> 34:33.578
As if it were your destiny
and not something you wrested

34:33.579 --> 34:36.447
from a man you dared to call friend!

34:36.449 --> 34:37.882
Abraham, that is not what...

34:37.882 --> 34:39.150
No!

34:39.150 --> 34:42.120
I was supposed to be
the hero of this story!

34:42.121 --> 34:43.321
Not the villain!

34:43.322 --> 34:46.324
Do not dare put this on me.

34:46.324 --> 34:48.659
You chose the mantle of Death!

34:48.661 --> 34:50.295
You chose Moloch!

34:50.295 --> 34:51.862
Two choices made

34:51.864 --> 34:56.234
in an instant that ensured
Katrina would never love you.

35:03.843 --> 35:06.144
Have you ever noticed that through it all,

35:06.145 --> 35:08.813
she always returns to me?

35:10.616 --> 35:12.851
You have. I can see it.

35:12.852 --> 35:14.619
Well, now she will be my bride.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.322
And you will have nothing!

35:33.973 --> 35:36.574
Come on, Methuselah.

35:36.575 --> 35:38.343
Which one are you?

35:38.344 --> 35:40.378
Lieutenant! The sword!

35:40.379 --> 35:42.880
I'm trying!

36:01.267 --> 36:03.101
There's no sword.

36:15.597 --> 36:17.464
How efficient.

36:17.465 --> 36:19.400
Two in one shot.

36:19.401 --> 36:20.801
Crane, I can see his head.

36:20.802 --> 36:22.336
The cave is enchanted.

36:22.337 --> 36:25.039
Now, where is the sword?

36:25.040 --> 36:26.407
It does not exist.

36:26.408 --> 36:28.041
Liar!

36:28.543 --> 36:30.644
It's true.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.079
Look around... no sword.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.480
All these years,

36:33.481 --> 36:35.516
all these great adventurers,

36:35.517 --> 36:38.852
now us... come for nothing.

36:39.621 --> 36:41.322
Nothing?

36:41.323 --> 36:46.393
No, old friend, you have come to die.

36:53.068 --> 36:54.902
The shofar has sounded.

36:54.903 --> 36:58.172
Moloch calls me to his side.

36:58.173 --> 37:00.507
Then go.

37:00.508 --> 37:03.143
Run to serve your master.

37:04.045 --> 37:07.147
But no matter what the outcome of today,

37:07.148 --> 37:09.416
you will always know the truth.

37:10.085 --> 37:12.553
That your jealousy made you thus.

37:12.554 --> 37:14.488
Not I.

37:17.859 --> 37:19.526
A moment.

37:19.527 --> 37:21.662
A twitch.

37:24.132 --> 37:26.867
We are the choices we make
in the moment, as you said.

37:26.868 --> 37:31.272
And I choose to watch you suffer in hell,

37:31.273 --> 37:35.576
looking on for an eternity as
I ride with your former wife.

37:36.978 --> 37:39.079
I choose who I am.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.583
I am the Horseman of Death!

37:42.584 --> 37:44.885
You have no sword.

37:44.886 --> 37:47.421
You are nothing.

37:57.532 --> 38:00.534
The trumpet.

38:00.535 --> 38:02.870
From the Book of Revelation.

38:04.306 --> 38:07.775
We're too late.

38:07.776 --> 38:10.210
I fear the prophecy was correct.

38:10.211 --> 38:14.315
I cannot see the sword
because I do not know myself.

38:14.316 --> 38:15.716
No, you do.

38:15.717 --> 38:18.419
You just had a shotgun to your
chest and were willing to die.

38:18.420 --> 38:21.955
Turn it around, and decide to live.

38:21.956 --> 38:23.991
Lieutenant, yes.

38:23.992 --> 38:25.459
"Decide."

38:25.460 --> 38:28.495
Deciding to live...

38:28.496 --> 38:32.299
that is the prophecy.

38:32.300 --> 38:36.003
Life is but a series of choices.

38:36.004 --> 38:39.139
You chose to be a patriot and a hero.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.008
Someone who does not give up,

38:41.009 --> 38:42.943
or the world around him ends.

38:42.944 --> 38:45.479
Thank you, Lieutenant.

38:45.480 --> 38:49.917
It is through your eyes that
I see myself most clearly.

38:50.585 --> 38:52.219
Okay.

38:52.220 --> 38:53.754
Let's find this damn sword.

38:53.755 --> 38:55.556
It's in here somewhere.

38:55.557 --> 38:56.724
Yes.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.960
"Know thyself, completely..."

38:59.961 --> 39:02.829
"Or perish when you attempt to see."

39:06.201 --> 39:08.102
Water.

39:08.103 --> 39:12.439
In which you see a
reflection of your true self.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.111
This isn't water.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.212
This is oil.

39:36.698 --> 39:38.766
God's wounds.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.235
Wait.

39:41.236 --> 39:43.303
All those statues out there,

39:43.304 --> 39:45.305
the ones that came here and failed,

39:45.306 --> 39:47.774
what do we have that they didn't?

39:49.477 --> 39:51.378
Each other.

40:22.210 --> 40:24.378
Oh, uh, after you.

40:24.379 --> 40:27.547
No, please.

40:42.697 --> 40:46.800
We shall not witness the
apocalypse on this night.

40:46.801 --> 40:51.405
Moloch shall not rise.

40:56.744 --> 40:58.779
The time has come.

40:58.780 --> 41:01.114
It begins.
