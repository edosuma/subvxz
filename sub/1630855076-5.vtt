WEBVTT

00:03.587 --> 00:05.923
-Well, look who it is.
-Oh, hi.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.342
-I made coffee.
-Oh, God bless you.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.428
(sighs)

00:12.513 --> 00:14.223
So, uh...

00:14.223 --> 00:16.600
I was watching you
sleep last night.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.519
Not on no creep shit, but...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.521
-Oh, God,
did I do something weird?
-No, no, no.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.481
I just think
you're really pretty

00:22.481 --> 00:24.274
-when you sleep.
-Shut up.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.776
Hey.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.653
Don't speak to me like that
in my own home.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.947
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was very rude.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.115
-You are pretty rude.
-I apologize.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.828
I have a surprise for you.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.039
-Uh-oh.
-But you can't be weird
about it,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.874
-and you have to
close your eyes.
-I'll do my best.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.709
Let's go. Come on.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.795
-Oh, God. Okay.
-Mm.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.129
-Should I be scared?
-Maybe.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.383
-(laughs)
-Check it out... now.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.551
(gasps)

00:51.551 --> 00:53.679
-It's a tent.
-It is a tent.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.764
And it's, like, one of
the top-of-the-line ones

00:55.764 --> 00:56.974
that has, like, this whole

00:56.974 --> 00:59.851
netting for bugs,
and then on top of it,

00:59.851 --> 01:01.895
it has, like,
this ventilation system

01:01.895 --> 01:03.730
that they were really
pushing on me at the store.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.441
-Seems really nice.
-Yeah. So, you down?

01:06.441 --> 01:08.068
-For what?
-To go camping.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.319
Oh, really?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.737
Let's just go this weekend,

01:10.737 --> 01:12.823
and we can sleep
underneath the stars

01:12.823 --> 01:14.866
and wake up with the sun,

01:14.866 --> 01:15.826
-and then we can cuddle...
-(chuckles)

01:15.826 --> 01:17.119
...because we're afraid
of bears.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.954
It'll be a lot of fun. Please?

01:18.954 --> 01:20.330
Mmkay.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.416
I mean, yeah, that sounds
kind of awesome.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.626
Okay, that was a lot easier

01:24.626 --> 01:26.211
-than I thought it was gonna be.
-(laughs)

01:26.211 --> 01:27.754
I thought you were gonna be
quite difficult about this.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.340
Yeah, I mean, I'm sort of
surprised, myself, but...

01:30.340 --> 01:33.302
Should we practice being, uh,
scared of bears?

01:33.302 --> 01:34.845
-I would love that.
-Yeah.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.096
-You know what I mean, right?
-Yeah.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.973
Okay.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.061
-Oh. It's kind of nice. Yeah.
-I told you.

so far away ♪

01:45.939 --> 01:47.733

01:50.402 --> 01:51.820
SAMANTHA and ALEX:
Oh!

01:51.820 --> 01:53.447
(Samantha laughs)

01:53.447 --> 01:54.948
I'll download a video,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.700
so we don't have this happen
when we're camping.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.368
I think that's a good idea.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.330
♪ So far away. ♪

02:01.330 --> 02:03.040
Let's keep talking
about the camping thing

02:03.040 --> 02:05.625
'cause I'm genuinely excited
about that.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.336
Aw, that's really cute.
Honestly, you guys are just

02:07.336 --> 02:09.129
gonna stare at the stars

02:09.129 --> 02:10.589
and try not to poop
in front of each other.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.007
You have no idea
how well I can hold it.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.258
No, you're gonna have
a great time.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.761
Joel and I used to go camping
every year.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.220
I'll take you
to the camping store.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.430
Ooh, there's one in, uh,
Rivertown Mall.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.973
Oh, yeah.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.600
Ooh, can we get...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.477
-BOTH: Orange Julius?
-Obviously. And some pretzels.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.686
Mm, I love you.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.521
All right, great.
Let's go shopping

02:26.521 --> 02:27.689
and get you some cute clothes.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.857
No, no, I don't want
cute clothes.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.359
I want a headlamp that opens,

02:30.359 --> 02:32.444
and it's, like, a knife
that can kill a bear,

02:32.444 --> 02:34.655
and then it also happens
to be a coffee mug.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.323
That's hot.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.347
Oh.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.140
-Whoa.
-Oops, sorry.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.975
-(both laugh)
-You-you got to watch it
with the door.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.811
It's always stuck,
so you got to body slam it,

03:05.811 --> 03:07.354
and then it flies open fast,

03:07.354 --> 03:08.855
and I'm always worried
I'm gonna kill someone.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.732
-No, no. It's good. (chuckles)
-Okay. (chuckles)

03:10.732 --> 03:12.651
Um, are you lost?

03:12.651 --> 03:13.985
I am not lost.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.029
Okay. Sorry. Um...

03:16.029 --> 03:18.281
-Well, I'm Jim, by the way.
-Okay.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.533
-I'm Carol.
-Carol.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.368
-Uh-huh. Hi.
-Hi, Carol.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.870
Are you here for the Friends and
Family of Alcoholics meeting?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.581
Because, usually,
we use the main entrance,

03:26.581 --> 03:28.166
-which is over there.
-No.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.127
-No? No. (chuckles)
-(laughs)

03:30.127 --> 03:31.962
You-you might be here
for the Anytime Fitness

03:31.962 --> 03:33.880
or the strip club,
which are both next door,

03:33.880 --> 03:35.257
but you're not dressed
for the gym,

03:35.257 --> 03:37.509
and the club doesn't open
until 5:00, I think.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.011
That's, uh, very funny.
No, I'm, um...

03:40.011 --> 03:42.305
I'm returning something...

03:42.305 --> 03:43.932
that's in my car.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.351
I'm returning a book.
A book that's in my car.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.936
-You're returning a book?
-Mm-hmm. Correct.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.021
Totally get that.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.065
All right. Have a great day.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.608
Good luck. I hope you find

03:53.608 --> 03:55.986
whatever it is
you're looking for.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.114
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

03:59.114 --> 04:01.533
I guess I mean the bookstore.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.618
That's what you're looking for,
and you'll find it.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.078
You know where it is.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.413
Right.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.459
(sighs)

04:13.503 --> 04:15.881
(whispers):
For God's sake.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.966
I cannot believe
there is no Orange Julius.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.551
Is it even a mall
with no Orange Julius?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.595
And the indignity of them
making it a Warby Parker.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.639
I know. I'm really offended.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.768
Okay, so, where is
the survivalist shit?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.269
'Cause that's what I want.
Like, the real stuff.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.771
Okay, you're going for two days.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.606
Well, yeah, but I want to be
prepared, you know?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.149
And, honestly,
you should be, too.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.942
I think we all know
there is an apocalypse coming.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.527
Mm-hmm. Oh, I know
what you need.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.696
Uh, Joel had this sleeping bag.
I mean, it's super tall,

04:39.696 --> 04:41.448
but I'm pretty sure they make it
for regular people, too.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.909
-Yes, okay, great.
-Um, God, I'm blanking
on the name,

04:43.909 --> 04:45.452
but I think I have it
on my phone.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.788
Okay, cool.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.419
(chuckles)

05:05.055 --> 05:07.557
SAMANTHA:
Aw, your camping phase.
So cute.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.227
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.604
-(chuckles)
-I think the sleeping bags

05:12.604 --> 05:15.148
-are over in
the camping section.
-Oh.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.359
The-the whole store is
a camping section, though.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.860
-Right? Okay.
-No, it's-it's not.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.904
-It all looks the same to me.
-That's really cute.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.240
(laughs)

05:31.122 --> 05:34.835
Ooh, I think I see them.
Follow me. That is hiking talk.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.795
BRIT:
Okay, MacGyver.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.755
(scattered clapping)

05:38.755 --> 05:41.591
GROUP LEADER:
Thanks you for that, Nina.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.844
Does anyone want to share?

05:45.303 --> 05:46.680
Bruce.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.681
(Bruce clears throat)

05:53.854 --> 05:56.356
-Hi.
-(members murmur greetings)

05:56.356 --> 06:00.277
So, um, my boss likes to talk,
and, lately,

06:00.277 --> 06:03.864
our work gym's been overcrowded,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.740
so the only open squat rack's
beside him,

06:05.740 --> 06:08.243
and I take it

06:08.243 --> 06:09.661
because I can't skip leg day,

06:09.661 --> 06:12.581
-but he talks so much.
-(phone chimes)

06:12.581 --> 06:14.833
BRUCE:
I can't get a good sweat on,

06:14.833 --> 06:16.877
and then my form,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.795
it-it's totally compromised.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.339
-(chuckling softly) Oh, my God.
-BRUCE: I'm just...

06:21.339 --> 06:23.466
I'm worried I'm-I'm never gonna
achieve my personal best.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.760
If Bruce doesn't kill it
on leg day, he's gonna drink.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.804
Okay, Mayor of Judgetown.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.932
Hey, I'm sorry, just feels like
Bruce's sobriety's

06:30.932 --> 06:32.225
a little fragile,
don't you think?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.394
-James, sit down.
-No cross-talk.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.230
I'm sorry, like...
your whole share

06:37.230 --> 06:41.192
is worried about getting swole
at the gym, I guess?

06:41.192 --> 06:43.361
No cross-talking.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.281
Okay, yeah, enough with
the cross-talk. I'll just go.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.159
All right?
I'll just talk right now.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.077
Hey, my name is James,

06:51.077 --> 06:52.829
and I have zero days.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.166
Zero.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.507
Hey, James.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.051
-Hmm?
-Look,

07:06.051 --> 07:07.552
if you have a real need
to share,

07:07.552 --> 07:09.638
you can share with me
after the meeting.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.473
You can jump all over me
if you want,

07:11.473 --> 07:14.601
but how is Bruce's work gym woes

07:14.601 --> 07:16.603
helping anybody?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.938
How is being drunk helping you?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.441
Nobody in there understands
what I'm going through.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.111
I know you're having trouble
with the program, but just

07:25.111 --> 07:26.905
keep coming back, okay?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.823
And next time, don't disrespect

07:28.823 --> 07:30.408
the people who are
doing the work.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.912
Okay, yeah.
You should go back inside.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.498
(door opens)

07:36.498 --> 07:38.166
Thank you.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.754
Ladies, I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.297
Why?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
I believe someone
may have acquired

07:45.965 --> 07:47.384
some merchandise without paying.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.177
-(laughs)
-Respectfully.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.096
Uh, okay, well, it wasn't me,

07:51.096 --> 07:53.014
'cause I paid
for all this stuff.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.641
I don't even know
what half of it is,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.810
but I paid for it. I have
a receipt in here somewhere.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
You can ask that lady
that I checked out with

07:58.520 --> 07:59.854
or something. I don't know.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.481
Just head to the back, please.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.067
(mocking): Mm, just head
to the back, please.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.038
(doorbell chimes)

08:19.040 --> 08:21.626
Baby, what are you doing here?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.586
-It's the middle of the day.
-I miss you.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.630
And you want me
to do your laundry.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.216
Yeah, I want you to do
my laundry, but I also miss you.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.386
(laughs) Okay, okay.
It's just that I haven't

08:31.386 --> 08:33.012
seen you in a while,

08:33.012 --> 08:35.348
and, you know, it's Wednesday.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.933
I thought you'd be at work.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.311
Oh, um... this is
a bit of our slow time.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.771
You know, we just
finished a big job,

08:41.771 --> 08:44.524
and, you know,
we're waiting on meetings

08:44.524 --> 08:46.192
and waiting for
somebody to bite,

08:46.192 --> 08:49.654
but excuse me for wanting
to visit my favorite person.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.865
Favorite? (laughs)

08:51.865 --> 08:54.325
Well, then come on in,
Black Santa.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.161
Don't you mean "Real Santa"?

08:56.161 --> 08:57.412
-Ah, thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.875
JIM:
Carol?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.460
You mind?

09:03.460 --> 09:05.211
Please.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.213
(clears throat)

09:08.465 --> 09:10.258
Ugh, burnt.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.177
I hate it when Brian
makes the pot.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.762
You're a regular here.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.597
Our meetings
are right across the street.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.683
Incidentally,
not close to a bookstore.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.686
-And you're enjoying this.
-(chuckles) Maybe a little bit.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.396
Look, I didn't like going
to these meetings either.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.398
She's in recovery now,
but before she was...

09:25.398 --> 09:27.776
(sighs) ...my sister
was really bad.

09:27.776 --> 09:28.777
She was such a bitch.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.862
She still is.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.739
It's actually kind of worse
now that she's sober.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.116
(laughs) Okay.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.202
But at least now we only fight
about libertarianism.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.246
What I'm saying is,
the meetings helped our family,

09:40.246 --> 09:41.790
and I'm sure it's a little
bit trite from the outside,

09:41.790 --> 09:42.791
-but...
-A little.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.125
But they help.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.127
I'm glad they work for you.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.254
I don't think
they're gonna work for me.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.715
Programs are not my thing.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.469
Okay. Are they a thing
for anyone in your family?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.012
Unfortunately, yes.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.972
Let me guess, your sister.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.725
-Your husband.
-My daughter... (sighs)

10:00.725 --> 10:02.227
...goes to meetings.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.603
You're too young
to have a daughter.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.271
-Ha.
-Look,

10:05.271 --> 10:06.815
there's no pressure
to participate.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.149
You just have to listen.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.609
Like auditing a class.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.861
(chuckles) Exactly.
We have this saying,

10:11.861 --> 10:13.321
"You should go to six meetings.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.281
If you still don't like it,
come to six more."

10:15.281 --> 10:17.450
See, that is outright theft,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.536
Jim, of a Buddhist saying.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.955
"If you don't have time to
meditate for an hour every day,

10:21.955 --> 10:24.582
you meditate for two hours."
(clicks tongue)

10:24.582 --> 10:26.626
This is the issue.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.503
Not giving Buddhists the credit
that they're due?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.630
The sayings. The sayings

10:30.630 --> 10:33.258
and the rules and the this
and that and-- Mm.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.843
I get it.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.594
All right, hear me out.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.682
What if we take
all those corny slogans

10:40.682 --> 10:42.433
and sayings,
and we arm you with them,

10:42.433 --> 10:44.811
and turn them back
against your daughter.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.147
-I mean, how much would that
piss her off?
-(laughing)

10:47.147 --> 10:48.815
-Okay. Okay.
-(chuckles)

10:48.815 --> 10:50.358
That is... that is
a fresh take, Jim.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.193
-Right?
-Yeah.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.695
Why should she be the only one
with these banal

10:53.695 --> 10:55.113
little quips that mean

10:55.113 --> 10:56.865
nothing and excuse

10:56.865 --> 10:59.659
absolutely everything?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.661
Yeah. Stick with me.
I mean, I've got, like,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.872
a hundred more ways to go after
these sober know-it-alls.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.123
It's... it's one of my passions.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.626
-Go on.
-Mm.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.296
(typing on keyboard)

11:11.296 --> 11:13.339
Seriously? Do you want
to just look in my bag?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.632
There's nothing in here,

11:14.632 --> 11:16.759
except my wallet, my phone,

11:16.759 --> 11:18.553
and a ChapStick that
doesn't have a cap.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.679
MARCUS:
You're cool.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.472
-I know you paid.
-Wh...

11:21.472 --> 11:23.516
Is there anything you'd like
to return to the store?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.894
You're accusing her of stealing?

11:25.894 --> 11:27.854
Look, I know what this is,

11:27.854 --> 11:29.939
and a lot of people
are gonna hear about it, okay?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.316
Because I happen to write

11:31.316 --> 11:34.027
for a little something
called Hit Pause.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.236
What's Hit Pause?

11:35.236 --> 11:37.614
It's... (scoffs)

11:37.614 --> 11:39.282
...hard to explain.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.242
It's a magazine, uh,

11:41.242 --> 11:43.870
it's an online source of

11:43.870 --> 11:45.705
lists and such.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.081
I've never seen it.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.000
Well, you know...
(scoffs) It's...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.544
It's a, it's a pretty
big deal, actually. I mean,

11:51.544 --> 11:52.921
I don't think that
it's really on newsstands

11:52.921 --> 11:53.880
anymore, but when was
the last time

11:53.880 --> 11:55.381
you even saw a newsstand, right?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.799
-Can't remember.
-Yeah.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.385
-But I'll look out for it.
-Great.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.179
I mean...
well, you should, because

12:01.179 --> 12:04.015
pretty soon there's gonna be
a piece in there about how you

12:04.015 --> 12:06.476
profiled a Harvard-educated

12:06.476 --> 12:08.394
-doctor who...
-Sam, stop.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.397
(sighs)

12:19.155 --> 12:21.574
Okay.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.284
I'm willing to let you go
this time,

12:23.284 --> 12:26.496
but this cannot happen again.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.039
-One time only.
-MARCUS: Wonderful.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.041
Looking forward to reading
that article, though.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.335
(chuckles)

12:38.841 --> 12:40.134
You want to stop and get
something to eat?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.011
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.347
-Don't you have to pack
and meet Alex?
-Yeah.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.185
You want to talk
about what just happened?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.645
No, not right now.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.565
You're talking to someone,
though, right? Like a therapist?

12:54.565 --> 12:57.485
Uh, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.863
If I had a therapist,
I would. (chuckles)

13:00.863 --> 13:03.825
I'd be like,
"Hey, Linda, guess what?"

13:03.825 --> 13:05.493
But then what, you know?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.121
Linda would die. (laughs) God,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.956
she would so hate me.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.582
Who wants to work
with somebody who's

13:11.582 --> 13:14.252
stealing shovels, you know?

13:14.252 --> 13:15.920
I mean, I mean... (stammers)

13:15.920 --> 13:19.007
She would laugh at me. She would
probably tell her twins.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.884
Just... I can't have

13:21.884 --> 13:24.178
that family thinking
that I'm a thief.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.221
I mean, they're
already going through

13:25.221 --> 13:26.639
so much with the separation

13:26.639 --> 13:28.433
and all the anxiety

13:28.433 --> 13:30.018
-and everything...
-You know therapy's not about

13:30.018 --> 13:31.436
whether or not they like you.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.937
I don't have a therapist.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.605
-Oh.
-What are you talking about?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.274
Sorry, you got really
deep into it. I got confused.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.400
I know, but I just said "if."

13:37.400 --> 13:39.861
-Uh-huh. Got it.
-Hypothetical.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.779
Look, you know, I-I know

13:41.779 --> 13:44.032
I haven't been
acting like me lately.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.743
Obviously, I have some stuff

13:46.743 --> 13:49.829
I need to work through.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.539
I just don't do it
with other people.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.376
I mean, ask Joel. That's why
our marriage didn't work out.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.171
I-If you want to talk about
what happened with Joel...

13:58.171 --> 14:01.007
(stammers) Just go have fun
on your trip with Alex.

I thought I taught you

14:15.396 --> 14:17.398
how to fold clothes
better than that.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.484
-You want me to...
-No, no, I got it under control.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.986
You can silently judge me
as I fold.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.155
You always got to do things
the James way.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.033
That's the only way
I know how, so...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.785
This won't happen again.

14:30.912 --> 14:34.123
I don't mind you in my hair.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.958
I just want to make sure
you're okay

14:48.221 --> 14:50.389
Okay, um...

14:50.389 --> 14:51.808
So I've been having some issues,

14:51.808 --> 14:53.643
a little bit.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.770
I quit my job
to focus on the app,

14:55.770 --> 14:58.689
and now my funding
is kind of running out.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.359
Baby, I'm sorry.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.403
I just never thought
I'd find myself back here.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.031
So... I've kind of just been

15:07.031 --> 15:09.575
waiting for somebody
to bite, but, meanwhile,

15:09.575 --> 15:11.410
got no job,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.246
no laundry machine,

15:13.246 --> 15:16.582
no girlfriend, nobody.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.377
What happened
with your little friend?

15:20.878 --> 15:23.631
Yeah, Sam and I
aren't really talking.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.633
She doesn't think
I'm in the best place.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.180
When was the last time
you went to church?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.307
Did you hear what I just said?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.145
I don't think I need Jesus
right now.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.564
Look...

15:39.564 --> 15:41.607
if you gonna come up in here

15:41.607 --> 15:44.694
and use my Tide Pods
for free-ninety-nine,

15:44.694 --> 15:47.321
you can at least join me
for Revival, right?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.490
Revival? Are you ser--
That's like super church.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.408
Mm-hmm.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.828
Yes, ma'am.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.079
(chuckles)

15:55.079 --> 15:56.372
Just...

15:56.372 --> 15:58.291
O-Okay. All right.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.257
So, just make me
understand this.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.759
Is-is-is it the woods
that's the problem?

16:08.759 --> 16:11.345
Like, we could just
go stay at a hotel.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.472
-We don't have to do...
-No, no, it's not,
it's not that.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.641
So, are we just moving too fast
and I made you commit

16:15.641 --> 16:17.018
to something you didn't want,

16:17.018 --> 16:18.519
and now you're just
trying to appease me?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.605
No, I was actually
really excited about this.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.733
Genuinely. I bought, like,
a ton of expensive stuff.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.194
Um, no, it's just,
it's my friend Brit,

16:26.194 --> 16:28.237
she's kind of
going through a weird time,

16:28.237 --> 16:29.822
I think, and I just

16:29.822 --> 16:32.200
feel like she shouldn't
be alone. I'm sorry.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.826
Is that okay?

16:33.826 --> 16:37.288
Yeah, it's okay.
Like, I'm a big boy.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.665
I can stay at home
without my girlfriend.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.502
Uh...

16:43.502 --> 16:45.796
Sorry, did you just,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.633
um, call me your girlfriend?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.801
-Yeah, I did do that. I did.
-Yeah.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.220
And, um...

16:52.220 --> 16:55.431
and also yourself a-a big boy?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.099
We don't have to talk
about that part.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.392
-No, we don't have
to talk about that.
-No.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.852
I like the girlfriend part,
though.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.771
Good. I like it, too.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.940
I'm sorry.

takes Zelle now.

(scoffs)

17:38.975 --> 17:40.685
What you doing?

17:42.228 --> 17:45.398
Here. The church needs
a new water heater.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.234
Why do we have to pretend like
you didn't just give this to me?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.695
Because I will miss you
if you go to Hell.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.364
Okay, Mom.

you need to break down

and let natural light in.
