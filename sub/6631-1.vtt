A cock push-up, my friend, is
where you lay on your stomach...

16:53.877 --> 16:56.345
and lift yourself off the ground
with nuthin' but your boner.

16:57.647 --> 16:59.308
No problem.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.209
The cock is a muscle.

17:02.252 --> 17:03.583
You gotta learn how to flex it.

17:03.620 --> 17:07.715
From now on, I want you to do
one cock push-up a day...

You hear that?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.850
The training is working, man.

18:18.895 --> 18:20.590
I made ten whole bucks
with my rock!

18:20.630 --> 18:22.564
Good. Go score me a dime bag.

18:22.599 --> 18:23.964
A what?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.831
Ten dollars' worth of weed.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.667
Now, listen.
Go down to Wake & Bake Pizza...

18:28.705 --> 18:30.502
Ask for Jojo.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.634
Tell him you want
the Bob Marley extra crispy.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.754
He'll know
what you're talking about.

18:34.778 --> 18:36.302
All right, dude. Roger that.

18:36.346 --> 18:38.007
One extra crispy coming up!

18:39.349 --> 18:42.580
Stone Age man
now had the muscle power...

18:42.619 --> 18:47.386
and mental power necessary
to evolve to new heights.

18:47.424 --> 18:49.892
He then found the means
to harness...

18:49.926 --> 18:52.724
an even greater energy source.

18:56.032 --> 18:58.933
The animals and creatures around him.

18:58.968 --> 18:59.968
Hmm.

19:00.003 --> 19:02.494
Animal power would give him the food...

19:02.539 --> 19:06.566
and transportation, the clothing
and entertainment...

19:06.609 --> 19:09.737
- needed for his long journey.
- Dude, turn it to Channel 14.

19:09.779 --> 19:11.713
In Search of Sasquatch is on.

19:15.518 --> 19:19.249
When you are able to snatch
this remote from my hand...

19:19.289 --> 19:21.883

the channels we watch.

19:22.926 --> 19:24.723
Try to snatch it.

19:43.947 --> 19:45.744
Welcome to the gig simulator.

19:45.782 --> 19:49.218
If you pass this test,
your training is complete.

19:49.252 --> 19:53.086
You will be ready to audition

19:53.123 --> 19:54.181

20:25.255 --> 20:27.052
Hu...

20:27.090 --> 20:33.427
Um... I don't know
if that's such a good idea, KG.

20:33.463 --> 20:36.261
Uh, I'd rather not do this
in front of strangers.

20:36.299 --> 20:37.309
What do you think
it's going to be like...

20:37.333 --> 20:38.857
when we play the Coliseum?

20:38.902 --> 20:40.028
No strangers allowed?

20:40.069 --> 20:41.764
OK.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.035

20:44.073 --> 20:45.904
Uh--Ha ha. All right.

20:46.843 --> 20:48.743
So, should I sing a song?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.414
Hey, sing something, douchebag!

20:54.684 --> 20:56.584
OK.

I like, imagine it.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.667
I already spent the last rent check.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.008

Tenac?

26:52.275 --> 26:53.936
What's that?

26:53.976 --> 26:56.274
It's a sign.

26:56.312 --> 26:57.973
A legacy.

27:02.952 --> 27:05.750
I've had this birthmark since I was born.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.986
I looked it up in the dictionary.

27:10.326 --> 27:12.658
It's not in there.

27:12.695 --> 27:15.095
I never knew what the hell it meant.

27:15.131 --> 27:17.531
Till now.

Neil Hamburger,

28:20.563 --> 28:22.554
Funny stuff.

28:22.598 --> 28:25.362
Uh, the next band
asked me to read this.

28:25.401 --> 28:28.029
"Since the beginning of time...

28:28.070 --> 28:32.370
"twas written in the stones
that one day, a band would come."

28:32.408 --> 28:34.933
"Well, that band has come...

28:34.977 --> 28:37.571

28:41.450 --> 28:43.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tenacious D.

28:45.888 --> 28:48.083
That was awesome,
the way you read that.

28:48.124 --> 28:49.386
Kage. Kage?

28:49.425 --> 28:51.586

28:51.727 --> 28:53.058
- OK.

We're Tenacious D
and this is our first concert ever...

28:55.231 --> 28:56.425
so it's kinda historical.

28:56.465 --> 28:59.491
And, um, we wrote this song that
gives you a little taste...

28:59.535 --> 29:00.812
of, like, the history of the band.

29:00.836 --> 29:02.098
Let's fucking do it, Kage, go!

29:02.138 --> 29:05.505
This is a song called
The History of Tenacious D.

29:05.541 --> 29:06.551
And it's not just
a list of bullshit...

29:06.575 --> 29:07.653

You guys, wait for me outside.

30:55.284 --> 30:57.445
I'm gonna go talk to the big cheese.

30:57.486 --> 30:58.578
Good call.

31:00.623 --> 31:02.454
So?

31:02.491 --> 31:04.015
What'd you think?

31:04.060 --> 31:05.789
It was OK.

31:05.828 --> 31:07.227
- It was OK?
- Mm-hm.

31:07.263 --> 31:08.491
You were OK. We were kick-ass.

31:08.531 --> 31:10.761
And we're gonna totally win
that money next week...

31:10.800 --> 31:12.427
at the open mic contest.

31:12.468 --> 31:14.436
Well, good luck.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.904
You know there's a lot
of stiff competition, so...

31:16.939 --> 31:20.602
you might wanna think about
writing some new material.

31:23.913 --> 31:27.007
That was amazing. You guys
changed people's lives tonight.

31:27.049 --> 31:28.812
I know, we were so awesome.

31:28.851 --> 31:31.684
Yeah, it was awesome.
Compared to bullshit.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.244
But compared to the greats?

31:33.289 --> 31:37.123
To Zeppelin? To the Beatles?
To fucking Beethoven?

31:38.260 --> 31:40.125
True. We were kick-ass.

31:40.162 --> 31:42.687
But if the D's gonna
win that prize money...

31:42.731 --> 31:45.598

32:27.877 --> 32:29.287
What are you doing?
Go. Go. Play something.

32:29.311 --> 32:31.370
Go fast. The magic only lasts a second.

32:31.413 --> 32:33.244
No, don't play fast.
I said start fast.

32:33.282 --> 32:34.772
But keep going, yes.

32:34.817 --> 32:36.944
Try to make it prettier.
Prettier, prettier. Prettier.

32:36.986 --> 32:38.563
Stop judging yourself,
you're judging yourself.

32:38.587 --> 32:39.713

33:45.120 --> 33:47.645
AC/DC. Van Halen.

33:52.127 --> 33:54.391
What do you have
that we don't have?

33:55.698 --> 33:57.598
Well, they all use
the same guitar pick.

33:58.968 --> 34:01.027
What?

34:08.043 --> 34:11.012
Looks like they all use
the same guitar pick.

34:13.047 --> 34:15.572
Holy shitballs.

34:26.295 --> 34:27.626
Too many picks.

34:27.663 --> 34:29.221
Let's see.

34:33.135 --> 34:34.466
I don't think they have it.

34:34.503 --> 34:36.748
Let's talk to the dude. We might
have to special order it.

34:36.772 --> 34:40.105

34:40.141 --> 34:41.666

34:41.710 --> 34:42.972
Can I help you gentlemen?

34:43.012 --> 34:46.106
Yeah, we're looking for
a guitar pick like this one.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.321
How'd you hear about this?

34:55.357 --> 34:56.790
What did Papardello tell you?

34:59.261 --> 35:02.719
Uh--Ahem. We just noticed
that all these musicians...

35:02.765 --> 35:03.775
are using the same guitar pick--

35:03.799 --> 35:04.799
Okay ka-ssh!

35:09.571 --> 35:13.974
Jerry, do me a favor, uh, ring up
these amp casters for me.

35:14.009 --> 35:15.670
Thank you, my man.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.744
In here.

35:30.492 --> 35:32.960
We can talk in here.

35:32.995 --> 35:35.293
What you seek...

35:35.331 --> 35:37.026
is the Pick...

35:38.767 --> 35:40.166
of Destiny.

35:41.904 --> 35:44.304
I think there's
a light switch back here.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.331
No, dude, you don't...

35:48.143 --> 35:50.202
Grab a seat.

35:50.245 --> 35:52.270
You two bozos
don't even realize it...

35:52.314 --> 35:53.645
but you just stumbled onto...

35:53.682 --> 35:55.547
the darkest secret
in the history of rock.

35:55.584 --> 35:57.518
Go on.

35:57.553 --> 35:59.953
I actually saw it once.

35:59.988 --> 36:01.649
I used to be a guitar tech.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.250
So one night, I'm working a gig
up in New Jersey or something.

36:04.293 --> 36:05.624
Some real mediocre band.

36:05.661 --> 36:07.891
Lead guitarist comes out,
starts shredding licks...

36:07.930 --> 36:09.795
way beyond his capabilities.

36:09.832 --> 36:11.710
Like shit that had to be
coming from somewhere else.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.725
I noticed he was using a new pick.

36:13.769 --> 36:16.431
Weird-looking thing with horns on it.

36:16.472 --> 36:19.373
Made of green ivory, or some shit.

36:19.408 --> 36:21.706
It was the pick, it wasn't him.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.088
He didn't know what he had, though.

36:23.112 --> 36:24.923
End of the show, he flicks it
back into the audience.

36:24.947 --> 36:27.643
Some kid catches it.

36:27.683 --> 36:29.446
Kid named Eddie.

36:29.485 --> 36:30.485
Eddie?

36:30.519 --> 36:32.077
Van Halen!

36:32.121 --> 36:33.782
Whoa.

36:33.822 --> 36:36.086
So I started researching it.

36:36.125 --> 36:40.084
Turns out this thing goes deeper
than I could have imagined.

36:40.129 --> 36:42.063
Way deeper.

36:42.831 --> 36:44.799
Back to the Dark Ages.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.165
I moved to Rome. Quit my job.

36:47.202 --> 36:48.669
Learned Latin.

36:48.704 --> 36:51.400
I gained the trust of the
night librarian at the Vatican.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.567
A gentleman named
Salvatore Papardello.

36:53.609 --> 36:55.754
He turned me on to some shit
that you wouldn't believe.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.803
Check this out.

36:57.846 --> 36:59.973
It's an ancient scroll.

37:00.015 --> 37:01.642
All in Latin.

37:01.683 --> 37:04.379
I translated it. Took me six years.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.752
Why didn't you just get a translator?

37:06.789 --> 37:09.189
And let him read it too?

37:11.994 --> 37:14.326
Listen to this.

37:14.363 --> 37:17.628
Long ago, a dark wizard
used his black magic...

37:17.666 --> 37:19.031
to summon Satan himself.

37:20.102 --> 37:21.933
Satanus.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.733
That's Latin for Satan.

37:23.772 --> 37:25.672
A horrific battle ensued.

37:25.707 --> 37:28.403
But the great demon
was far too powerful.

37:28.444 --> 37:30.469
Snakes!

37:30.512 --> 37:33.072
Finish me, foul beast!

37:33.115 --> 37:35.879
Luckily, a blacksmith
heard the beast's roars.

37:35.918 --> 37:38.113
No!

37:38.987 --> 37:40.249
Ow!

37:40.289 --> 37:42.723
Fuck! You chipped my tooth.

37:42.758 --> 37:44.157
I'm not complete.

37:44.193 --> 37:47.458
Venisti remanebis
donec denuo completus sis.

37:47.496 --> 37:48.963
What does that mean?

37:48.997 --> 37:52.433
From whence you came
you shall remain...

37:54.069 --> 37:55.798
until you are complete again.

37:56.705 --> 37:58.195
Fuck you! No!

37:58.240 --> 38:01.232
No! I'm not complete!

38:01.276 --> 38:03.506
The demon was drawn back
into the fires of hell...

38:03.545 --> 38:07.447
and the dark wizard
was totally stoked to be alive.

38:07.483 --> 38:09.713
With a long draw on his hash pipe...

38:09.751 --> 38:12.777
the wizard devised a way
to repay the blacksmith.

38:12.821 --> 38:15.051
The blacksmith loved a fair maiden.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.355
To gain her affection, he would
need a true master skill...

38:18.393 --> 38:20.987
that would leave the maiden
moist and wanting.

38:21.029 --> 38:24.260
And so the wizard fashioned
the demon's tooth...

38:24.299 --> 38:27.200
into a pick that would make
the blacksmith play...

38:27.236 --> 38:30.262
only the most masterful
of melodies on his lute...

38:31.607 --> 38:35.873
thereby winning the heart
of the maiden he loved.

38:37.179 --> 38:40.307
The secret of the pick died
with that blacksmith.

38:40.349 --> 38:41.680
And then... poof!

38:41.717 --> 38:44.948
All of a sudden it reappears
in the American South...

38:44.987 --> 38:47.455
at the turn of the century,
in Robert Johnson's fingers.

38:47.489 --> 38:49.980
Spawns the birth of the blues.
And rock & roll.

38:50.025 --> 38:51.117
Of course.

38:51.159 --> 38:53.354
The pick is a tiny part
of the beast...

38:53.395 --> 38:55.693
so it has
supranatural qualities.

38:55.731 --> 38:58.996
- Supernatural?
- No, supra-natural.

38:59.034 --> 39:02.492
That's like
a whole other level above super.

39:02.538 --> 39:04.165
Where is it now?

39:05.474 --> 39:09.137
That's the last known photo
of the pick.

39:09.177 --> 39:10.542
That guitar was sold at auction.

39:10.579 --> 39:13.810
It now resides in the
Rock & Roll History Museum.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.141
That's where the POD is too.

39:17.185 --> 39:20.245
- The POD?
- The Pick of Destiny.

39:20.289 --> 39:21.722
Oh.

39:21.757 --> 39:23.987
Why didn't you just go get it?

39:24.026 --> 39:27.052
The Rock & Roll History Museum
is an impenetrable fortress.

39:27.095 --> 39:31.589
You two bozos wanna steal
the Pick of Destiny...

39:31.633 --> 39:32.930
count me out.

39:32.968 --> 39:35.061
I already went down
that rabbit hole once.

39:35.103 --> 39:37.196
And I got news for you.

39:37.239 --> 39:39.537
There's no cheese at
the end of that tunnel, buddy.

39:40.876 --> 39:43.106
All right, get outta here.
I told you enough already.

39:43.145 --> 39:45.010
C'mon, get outta here.

39:45.047 --> 39:47.038
Man, I don't know what to say.

39:47.082 --> 39:48.777
Shh.

39:48.817 --> 39:50.842
Just get outta my store.

39:53.589 --> 39:55.250
The Quest!

40:03.332 --> 40:05.857
Oh, my God! You guys!
What are you doin' here?

40:05.901 --> 40:07.926
- Come on in!
- Actually, we can't stay.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.369
We were hopin'
you'd do us a favor.

40:09.404 --> 40:11.634
Anything you need, man.

40:11.673 --> 40:14.301
- Do you think it would be OK--
- We need your car.

40:14.343 --> 40:16.368
Oh.

40:16.411 --> 40:19.539
Um, well,
kinda need it for work.

40:19.581 --> 40:20.878
Listen, man.

40:20.916 --> 40:23.714
We've got a meeting
with the hugest president...

40:23.752 --> 40:26.380
of the most massive
record company in the business.

40:26.421 --> 40:28.753
We need to meet him
in Sacramento tonight.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.155
Oh.

40:30.192 --> 40:31.989
Uh--

40:32.027 --> 40:33.756
Well--

40:33.795 --> 40:35.057
All right.

40:35.097 --> 40:36.621
Hey, what's up with this pedal?

40:36.665 --> 40:38.098
That's my extra brake.

40:38.133 --> 40:40.829
I'm a pizza delivery guy
and a driving instructor.

40:40.869 --> 40:43.702
I teach people how to drive
while I deliver 'zas.

40:43.739 --> 40:45.730
Ha ha ha! Good thinkin', man.

40:46.475 --> 40:47.772
Later.

40:52.848 --> 40:55.612
Knock 'em dead
at the meeting, you guys.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.984
I can't stop thinkin'
about that fuckin' pick.

41:01.023 --> 41:03.651
You heard the guy. It's Satan's tooth.

41:03.692 --> 41:05.182
When we get that thing...

41:05.227 --> 41:06.804
we're gonna win
that fuckin' prize money...

41:06.828 --> 41:09.763
then we're gonna
dominate the world of rock.

41:10.766 --> 41:13.564
We're gonna be unstoppable, man.

41:13.602 --> 41:16.298
Hmmm...

41:16.338 --> 41:18.363
Unstoppable.

41:18.407 --> 41:22.138
Unstoppable.

41:22.177 --> 41:24.304
Unstoppable.

41:24.346 --> 41:27.611
This, uh, next band
asked me not to read this...

41:27.649 --> 41:32.677
but, God damn it,
I'm going to read it anyway...

41:32.721 --> 41:34.348
because I wrote it...

41:34.389 --> 41:36.653
and it's the truth.

41:36.692 --> 41:39.525
"l fucking love this band!"

41:40.662 --> 41:44.359
They are the best band ever, period!

41:44.399 --> 41:50.497
Ladies and gentlemen, Tenacious D!

41:56.244 --> 41:57.404
Hey, what's up?

41:57.446 --> 42:01.405
Me and KG wrote this song
five minutes ago.

42:01.450 --> 42:03.247
It's called Master Exploder.

JB, wake up. JB, wake up!

44:50.218 --> 44:51.685
Let's chow down, dude.

44:51.720 --> 44:53.483
- I'm starving.
- OK.

45:12.407 --> 45:13.999
You guys know what you want?

45:14.042 --> 45:16.442
Hmm.

45:16.478 --> 45:18.241
What do you recommend?

45:18.280 --> 45:20.180
I recommend
that you order some food.

45:21.349 --> 45:22.748
OK.

45:22.784 --> 45:28.450
Uh--Lemme have
the fried chicken and a steak...

45:29.324 --> 45:30.552
and the chicken-fried steak.

45:32.227 --> 45:33.660
Hello.

45:33.695 --> 45:36.220
Um--What happened to your eye?

45:38.099 --> 45:40.124
I burned it with a curling iron.

45:41.469 --> 45:44.199
I'll have one small glass
of carrot juice.

45:44.239 --> 45:45.467
Yeah, we don't have that here.

45:45.507 --> 45:47.270
Then I will have nothing.

45:47.309 --> 45:48.970
Great.

45:52.747 --> 45:54.908
- Dude, what's the matter?
- Dude?

45:54.950 --> 45:56.747
Aren't you hungry?
You should eat somethin'.

45:56.785 --> 45:59.117
No. I never eat before a mission.

45:59.154 --> 46:00.621
It slows you down.

46:00.655 --> 46:03.180
I gotta be light on my feet
like a dancer.

46:03.224 --> 46:05.089
Like a fuckin' ninja, dude.

46:05.126 --> 46:06.126
Now check this out.

46:06.161 --> 46:07.958
I'm gonna jump this fence here.

46:07.996 --> 46:09.486
OK? Like a gazelle.

46:09.531 --> 46:11.999
Then you come around
that fuckin' bend.

46:12.033 --> 46:14.501
God! Damn it, Kyle!

46:14.536 --> 46:16.470
If we're gonna do this,
you gotta stay focused.

46:16.504 --> 46:18.301
Eye of le tigre!

46:18.340 --> 46:19.466
Now check it out.

46:19.507 --> 46:22.601
You give me a fuckin' boost,
He-Man style.

46:22.644 --> 46:25.078
And then we're gonna fuckin' do
a little mini-tiger roll...

46:25.113 --> 46:26.257
- And come on back.
- Oh, my God. Stop it!

46:26.281 --> 46:27.873
I fuckin' pull your shit up.

46:27.916 --> 46:30.282
Dude, hold on. That's good stuff.

46:35.523 --> 46:38.083
You're right, he's coming over here.

46:40.695 --> 46:42.856
- Oh!
- Fuckin' dick squeezer.

46:58.847 --> 47:00.678
Aaah!

47:06.321 --> 47:07.982
Uh--

47:14.963 --> 47:16.624
Hey...

47:17.932 --> 47:19.923
buddy.

47:19.968 --> 47:22.732
Heh heh heh.

47:22.771 --> 47:26.502
So, uh, what, uh, brings you...

47:26.541 --> 47:29.305
to this neck of the woods?

47:29.344 --> 47:32.142
Um--Ahem. We're just
on a little business trip.

47:32.180 --> 47:33.909
Mm.

47:33.948 --> 47:36.416
Are you, uh, going to, uh...

47:36.451 --> 47:39.511
check out
the Rock & Roll History Museum?

47:39.554 --> 47:42.182
- The Rock & Roll what?
- History Museum.

47:42.223 --> 47:43.601
Oh, no. I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

47:43.625 --> 47:47.584
You just seem like
Rock & Roll types to me.

47:47.629 --> 47:49.153
- Ha ha!
- Yeah, well, we're not.

47:49.197 --> 47:51.131
We're just
two fuckin' businessmen...

47:51.166 --> 47:52.743
on our way
to see some shit in Sacramento.

47:52.767 --> 47:55.065
- So, sorry.
- Hmm. Yes. Yes.

47:55.103 --> 47:57.697
I was just asking because...

47:57.739 --> 48:01.175
I noticed the guitars
in the back seat of your car.

48:01.209 --> 48:03.609
Yeah, well, I said,
we're fuckin' businessmen.

48:03.645 --> 48:05.556
We sell guitars. So what?
Big deal. End of story.

48:05.580 --> 48:06.842
Check, please!

48:06.881 --> 48:08.125
You're sure you aren't planning...

48:08.149 --> 48:10.947
on breaking into
the Rock & Roll History Museum?

48:10.985 --> 48:13.044
Hey, gimme that back, man!

48:15.957 --> 48:17.686
Yeah, my buddy and I are in a band.

48:17.725 --> 48:20.489
I don't like to say the name,
but uh, we had some hits...

48:20.528 --> 48:22.359
And so, uh, they're inductin' us...

48:22.397 --> 48:24.865
into the Rock & Roll History Museum.

48:24.899 --> 48:26.730
- No way!
- Aaah.

48:26.768 --> 48:28.133
Way.

48:28.169 --> 48:30.228
Oh, my God. We're sitting
with someone famous?

48:30.271 --> 48:31.738
Ah, we're just regular guys.

48:31.773 --> 48:35.709
I mean, uh,
we're just flesh and... bone.

48:49.090 --> 48:51.786
Let's just say you are planning...

48:51.826 --> 48:54.488
on breaking into
the Rock & Roll History Museum.

48:55.630 --> 48:57.461
Maybe you are inexperienced...

48:57.499 --> 49:01.560
and you get inside
and cry like little girl.

49:01.603 --> 49:05.232
Maybe you don't have
what it takes to get the job done.

49:09.177 --> 49:11.077
'Scuse me.

49:13.047 --> 49:14.912
Man, God!

49:20.755 --> 49:23.280
Yeah. Damn.

49:37.539 --> 49:44.638
I was thinking maybe there
was something in that museum...

49:44.679 --> 49:46.806
you had a desire for.

49:48.049 --> 49:50.984
Maybe--

49:51.019 --> 49:52.646
Pick of Destiny!

49:57.926 --> 50:01.157
Our sorority is throwing
a huge bash tonight.

50:01.196 --> 50:03.289
You guys should totally come...

50:03.331 --> 50:04.909
and play some
of your songs at the party.

50:04.933 --> 50:07.197
We're just getting ready
to head over there right now.

50:07.235 --> 50:09.135
Why don't you follow us over?

50:09.170 --> 50:10.967
You know what?

50:11.005 --> 50:12.233
That sounds rad.

50:12.273 --> 50:14.332
We don't usually play private parties...

50:14.375 --> 50:18.641
but I think we can make
some dreams come true tonight.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.477
Hee hee hee hee!

50:20.515 --> 50:21.982
I'll ride along with you.

50:22.016 --> 50:23.745
So you don't get lost.

50:25.253 --> 50:29.314
I tried to get
the Pick of Destiny once.

50:29.357 --> 50:32.622
I had it in my hands, too.

50:32.660 --> 50:36.061
But I was caught. Set off a laser.

50:36.097 --> 50:39.157
Security door came down on my leg.

50:39.200 --> 50:41.259
- Cut it right off.
- Ooh.

50:41.302 --> 50:45.261
I would break in again
if I still had my leg.

50:47.775 --> 50:50.767
My leg. Oh, man.

50:50.812 --> 50:54.942
I miss that sweet-ass leg of mine.

50:54.983 --> 50:57.349
Why are you telling me this?

51:00.421 --> 51:05.051
I like you. I see the spark
in your eye that I once had.

51:05.093 --> 51:07.027
Let me show you something.

51:09.230 --> 51:12.461
These are my plans.
They will help you, I promise.

51:12.500 --> 51:15.298
There are two air ducts on the roof.

51:15.336 --> 51:17.531
You must enter through there.

51:17.572 --> 51:19.301
Speak of this to no one!

51:20.441 --> 51:22.102
Wait.

51:22.143 --> 51:23.804
Wait, I have some questions.

51:23.845 --> 51:25.176
Let me wipe.

51:25.213 --> 51:26.271
Hold up, dude.

51:31.953 --> 51:35.286
Dude. I got some smokin' bettys
over there...

51:35.323 --> 51:36.620
and they want us to play a gig.

51:36.658 --> 51:39.752
No. I just had the weirdest
conversation of my life.

51:39.794 --> 51:42.228
This guy just gave me
the perfect plan.

51:42.263 --> 51:43.787
Now, look.

51:43.831 --> 51:47.267
There's two air ducts on the roof.

51:48.036 --> 51:50.334
Dude. The party?

51:50.371 --> 51:52.066
Gettin' to play our own tunes?

51:52.106 --> 51:56.475
That blonde over there wants
to ride my wrinklestick, yo.

51:56.511 --> 51:59.139
Would you get your head out of
the fuckin' pussy-clouds, man?

51:59.180 --> 52:00.841
Who cares about these chicks?

52:00.882 --> 52:02.975
There's gonna be ten times
hotter babes backstage...

52:03.017 --> 52:04.917
when we win album of the year.

52:04.952 --> 52:07.420
This pick is our ticket to genius.

52:07.455 --> 52:11.323
Dude. I can't believe you'd
pass by a gig opportunity...

52:11.359 --> 52:12.986
with some sweet-ass hotties--

52:13.027 --> 52:14.119
What, for this?

52:14.162 --> 52:16.528
Is this really
that important to you? Huh?

52:16.564 --> 52:19.089
We can still write a masterpiece
and win that dough.

52:19.133 --> 52:20.760
Maybe it would be better for the D...

52:20.802 --> 52:22.827
if we worked on our songwriting...

52:22.870 --> 52:25.065
instead of relying on
ancient bullshit, but--

52:25.106 --> 52:26.664
probably won't work anyway.

52:28.176 --> 52:29.871

01:16:07.227 --> 01:16:09.195
Whoa!

01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:10.526
Sounds scary, though.

01:16:10.563 --> 01:16:12.588
Yeah. Uh, it's really fucking scary.

01:16:12.632 --> 01:16:14.691
I'm shaking right now, I'm so scared.

01:16:14.734 --> 01:16:17.100

Hey. Hey.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.711
Hey, guys, you're runnin' a little late.

01:17:55.735 --> 01:17:57.580
There's one spot left.
You got any new material?

01:17:57.604 --> 01:18:00.300
What we got's gonna turn
your brain into shit.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.037
Dust off the stage,
open mic host. Step aside.

01:18:05.111 --> 01:18:06.601
OK, big shots.

01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:08.045
You're up whenever you're ready.

01:18:08.081 --> 01:18:10.515
Let's blister this asshole.

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:12.711
Jack, wait! You got the pick?

01:18:12.752 --> 01:18:14.083
Yeah. Got it right here.
Let's go.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.021
Maybe I should use it tonight
and you use it next time.

01:18:17.056 --> 01:18:18.767
I should use it tonight.
I'm the lead singer.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:21.692
Huh! It's a guitar pick.
I'm lead guitar.

01:18:21.728 --> 01:18:23.320
OK, dude, don't freak out on me.

01:18:23.363 --> 01:18:25.228
Let's just work this out rationally, OK?

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:26.459
We'll take turns with it.

01:18:26.499 --> 01:18:27.910
I'll use it now, you'll use it later.

01:18:27.934 --> 01:18:30.562
I'm not freakin' out,
you're freakin' out.

01:18:30.603 --> 01:18:33.333
Now, just let me hold it
for one second!

01:18:33.373 --> 01:18:36.240
You're never gonna use
this fuckin' pick.

01:18:37.443 --> 01:18:38.443
Aaah!

01:18:38.478 --> 01:18:39.604
Aaaah!

01:18:39.646 --> 01:18:41.637
- No!
- No!

01:18:41.681 --> 01:18:43.525
You guys, the crowd's
gettin' restless in there.

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:44.549
- No!
- Hey, wh-what's--

01:18:44.584 --> 01:18:46.381
What's goin' on?

01:18:46.419 --> 01:18:48.046
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what's wrong?

01:18:48.087 --> 01:18:50.055
We can't go on.

01:18:50.089 --> 01:18:52.421
We had the demon's pick...

01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:53.584
but then we broke it...

01:18:53.626 --> 01:18:56.561
and now our masterpiece
will never happen.

01:18:56.596 --> 01:19:00.032
We can't pay the rent because
we won't be fueled by Satan.

01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:02.364
Come on, get up, get up.

01:19:02.402 --> 01:19:05.894
Come on, come on. Stand up.
You're all right.

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:09.807
You guys, having
some satanic guitar pick...

01:19:09.842 --> 01:19:12.072
isn't gonna make
your rock any better...

01:19:12.111 --> 01:19:14.739
because Satan's not
in a guitar pick...

01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:16.373
he's inside all of us.

01:19:16.416 --> 01:19:18.179
He's in here.

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:19.878
In your hearts.

01:19:19.919 --> 01:19:22.752
He's what makes us
not want to go to work...

01:19:22.789 --> 01:19:26.316
exercise, or tell the truth.

01:19:26.359 --> 01:19:27.951
He's what makes us want to party...

01:19:27.994 --> 01:19:30.462
and have sex with each other
all night long.

01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:34.193
He's that little voice in your mind...

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.725
that says, "Fuck you"
to the people you hate.

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:40.637
Now, you can stay out here
and fight on the ground...

01:19:40.673 --> 01:19:43.198
and cry like babies.

01:19:43.242 --> 01:19:48.407
Or you can go in there
like friends and rock.

01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:52.247
So, what's it gonna be?

01:19:54.053 --> 01:19:57.614
Let's go in there and show 'em
what Tenacious D is all about.

01:19:57.657 --> 01:19:58.988
Yeah.

01:19:59.025 --> 01:20:02.324
I already got a guitar pick anyways.

01:20:05.965 --> 01:20:07.626
C'mon.

01:20:42.435 --> 01:20:44.630
Dude, we can still use the pick.

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:46.467
You use one half, I'll use the other.

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:47.783

in there, probably.
