WEBVTT

00:56.926 --> 00:58.319
Hyah!

01:42.319 --> 01:44.626
Aaron: They keep coming from
the direction of the border.

01:44.669 --> 01:48.064
Just a constant
wave after wave.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.152
This is her.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.285
You know your training.
Lock it down.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.262
Woman:
There's more coming!

02:17.572 --> 02:18.703
Man:
There's more coming in!

02:50.996 --> 02:53.695
It's not smart to go to sleep
unless it's safe.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.218
No.

02:55.262 --> 02:59.483
It's not.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.705
Well?

03:03.748 --> 03:05.185
"Well" what?

03:05.228 --> 03:07.491
Is it safe?

03:07.535 --> 03:10.233
Man: Michonne, do you copy?

04:34.535 --> 04:36.667
How long
till the next wave hits?

04:36.711 --> 04:40.105
One hour from the north,
two from the south.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.325
Northern wave's thicker
than fleas on a farm dog,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.719
but the southern's
more dispersed.

04:44.762 --> 04:45.937
By my estimation,

04:45.981 --> 04:48.200
we'll be fighting
into the night again.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.680
Yeah, can't push 'em
too much further.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.117
I have eyes.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.033
Sorry.
I'm just tired.

04:55.077 --> 04:58.341
We all are.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.308
Hey, heads up.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.889
The north border.
Now.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.370
Call off your walkers.Not us.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.589
Yeah, right.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.112
Not.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.070
Us.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.899
Go to the border,
lay down your weapons,

05:34.943 --> 05:36.161
and wait.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.424
Wait for what?

05:37.467 --> 05:40.383
Her.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.177
All right!

05:53.831 --> 05:55.920
Is this your mother?

05:55.964 --> 05:58.096
No.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.316
I don't think it is.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.274
Why's she want
to talk with us?

06:02.318 --> 06:04.451
You crossed
into her land.

06:04.494 --> 06:07.236
Again.
You have to answer for that.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.933
We don't have to
do anything.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.413
We could just not go.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.589
That's a bad idea.We're already
under attack.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.112
Yeah!Yeah!
Yeah!Yeah!

06:14.156 --> 06:15.766
It isn't her.

06:16.898 --> 06:19.248
If she wanted you dead,
she'd send the horde.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.424
All of it,
not just a few waves at a time.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.165
Maybe she's trying
to wear us down first.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.080
Or, as I relayed
to you all

06:25.123 --> 06:27.343
at the beginning of this
meeting, there's plausible
reason to believe

06:27.387 --> 06:29.258
that the satellite
and fire --Margo: I don't want
to hear about

06:29.301 --> 06:31.303
the damn satellite anymore,
Eugene!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.395
My friends died
trying to save yours

06:35.438 --> 06:37.875
and ended up
with their heads on spikes.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.313
The Highwaymen
want justice!

06:41.357 --> 06:42.837
Yeah!Yeah!
Yeah!Yeah!

06:42.880 --> 06:44.404
So all I want
to hear from you

06:44.447 --> 06:46.275
is that you're gonna take
a dozen of us

06:46.318 --> 06:47.668
to meet these freaks
at the border

06:47.711 --> 06:50.322
and that we're gonna take
that lead bitch's head off!

06:50.366 --> 06:51.802
Gage:
We cut it off!

06:51.846 --> 06:53.587
And then we'll put
theirheads on spikes!

06:55.023 --> 06:56.720
You all right?

06:56.764 --> 06:59.244
Yeah. Yeah, I just need
to get some air.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.301
How many walkers did you see
in Alpha's horde?

07:13.345 --> 07:15.739
Tens of thousands.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.132
Ah.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.786
So...

07:18.829 --> 07:21.310
What's your plan
for taking them out?

07:24.356 --> 07:26.315
Oh,
that wasn't rhetorical.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.404
I don't have one.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.797
Ah.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.452
Does anybody else?

07:34.018 --> 07:38.240
If she sends that horde,
that's it!

07:38.283 --> 07:41.286
Right now,
all she wants to do is talk.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.071
And we are going to listen.

07:43.114 --> 07:47.423
Now, while we are doing that,
everyone here needs to focus

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
on what's coming in
from the north and the south.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.692
We're tired.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.390
We are on edge.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.959
And it is going to get worse
before it gets better.

08:02.003 --> 08:06.007
But we aren't gonna
get through it at all

08:06.050 --> 08:09.314
if we do not act as one.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.448
Three objectives
means three groups.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.841
Gabriel will take point

08:13.884 --> 08:16.408
in guarding the gate
from the northern wave...

08:16.452 --> 08:18.454
while Aaron
will take some troops

08:18.498 --> 08:20.369
and handle the southern wave,

08:20.412 --> 08:22.371
breaking it up
before it hits the wall.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.288
That leaves us,
and the border.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.986
Unarmed.
You're really
going in there unarmed?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.858
We got no choice.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.353
We're good.
You're low
on soldiers already.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.746
The ones you have
are fighting fatigue.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.313
Negan has only
been on cleanup duty.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.836
I said we're good.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.577
Hey, uh, Gabe.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.927
Can I...

08:59.451 --> 09:00.496
Look, man,
if it's all the same to you,

09:00.540 --> 09:01.802
I'd rather
just stay here

09:01.845 --> 09:03.586
and pick tomatoes
and bury corpses.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.501
Gabriel: He needs you
out there.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.024
Yeah,
I need me in here,

09:07.068 --> 09:08.373
especially on
a day like today.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.593
I mean, look around --
everybody's amped to 11,

09:10.637 --> 09:11.638
pissed at the skins,

09:11.681 --> 09:13.509
stirring shit up
with each other.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.728
I told you,
I don't want

09:14.771 --> 09:17.078
any of those hateful vibes
taken out on me.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.297
It's Aaron.
He's a saint.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.084
Look,
I just want to stay here.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.303
Can you just
do me that solid, Gabe?

09:25.347 --> 09:26.566
You can fight.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.393
You are low
on fighters.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.570
Peanut butter,
meet jelly.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.615
You're taking him.
End of discussion.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.665
So...

09:38.708 --> 09:40.536
That's awesome.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.105
Good on you,
puttin' the ol' stump to use.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.141
Oh.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.970
Oh, lookie here.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.015
Oh, God.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.452
Drop it.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.107
Come on.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.588
I'm pretty sure that God
put this here for a reason --

10:32.632 --> 10:33.676
to help me,
help you--

10:33.720 --> 10:36.418
Put it down.
Look,
we both know

10:36.461 --> 10:38.550
that this broomstick
ain't cutting it.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.690
I am trying
to make things better,

10:47.734 --> 10:49.474
and I am not
that guy that you think --

10:49.518 --> 10:50.954
There's three coming in.

10:53.435 --> 10:56.394
They're on your side.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.614
Right. Okay.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.399
I am on it,
boss.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.460
You all right?

12:03.984 --> 12:07.248
I...
need a minute.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.710
Thanks for
coming out with me.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.104
I could --
I could go all night.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.717
You wanna go back,
don't you?

12:44.067 --> 12:46.200
I'm good.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.902
Heads up.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.595
Alpha: There was one rule
between our people.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.640
One law.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.992
Stay where you are.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.777
Yet you disobey.

13:41.821 --> 13:46.347
Daryl: That fire would've
destroyed your land.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.784
Fire's nature to burn.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.091
We have no conflict
with nature.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.789
It could've wiped out
one of our communities.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.618
We were not gonna sit back
and let that happen.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.054
You can understand that.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.796
We crossed one time.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.059
Three times.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.760
During the fire,
you walked my land.

14:08.804 --> 14:12.590
And during the winter storm,
you walked my land.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.898
During your search
along the river,

14:15.942 --> 14:18.858
you and the man with
the metal arm walked my land.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.383
That's three times.

14:22.426 --> 14:27.649
We are always watching.

14:31.392 --> 14:35.396
What did I tell you
about crossing my border?

14:41.054 --> 14:43.621
You have to be punished.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.851
But...

14:55.895 --> 14:58.941
I consider context.

14:58.985 --> 15:02.205
There will be
no bloodshed this time.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.859
So what do you want?

15:05.687 --> 15:07.776
Land.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.909
The creek
that winds into the valley.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.867
That is
your new southern border.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.826
We will mark the new border
to the north.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.176
That'll cut off
our hunting grounds.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.221
We don't have to stand here
and listen to this --

15:18.265 --> 15:20.354
Carol!

15:20.397 --> 15:23.879
"To this"...

15:23.923 --> 15:26.099
what?

15:28.014 --> 15:31.147
To this bullshit.Daryl: That's it.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.453
Come on.
We're done.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.715
Let's go.We're not.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.158
Not until this one
lowers her eyes to my feet.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.779
You should fear me.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.912
I don't.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.524
I look at you
and I feel nothing at all.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.964
Is that right?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.924
The blonde boy...

16:08.968 --> 16:13.102
screamed your name
just before we took his head.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.807
Stop. Stop!

16:22.851 --> 16:25.158
I apologize...

16:25.201 --> 16:27.508
for my friend.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.031
We have not slept.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.729
And you know
what she lost.

16:34.254 --> 16:37.126
I forgive you.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.476
Mother to mother.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.570
This is my land now.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.746
You better run.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.183
Daryl: Come on.Let's go.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.839
Let's go.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.038
Listen.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.822
I know that
you're dealing with --

17:20.865 --> 17:22.563
The bitch has to die.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.620
She ain't been the same
since she got off that boat.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.319
Maybe she's better off
on it.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.669
Found some peace,
you know?

17:41.712 --> 17:43.236
Michonne: Hey.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.933
She belongs with us.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.543
She ain't sleeping,
either.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.937
She's out all night
looking for them.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.344
Shit.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.997
What happened?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.303
Whisperers.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.479
Three of them.Walkies on.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.178
Split up -- north, west.
We'll take east.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.136
Capture!
Do not kill!

18:32.720 --> 18:34.722
Hey, you, uh --

18:34.765 --> 18:36.289
What did I say?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.292
I had to.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.121
Did you not see this...

18:44.906 --> 18:46.734
What, do you want me
to hang myself?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.170
Tie up.
I'm taking you back.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.650
Taking me back?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.782
That is the best freaking news
I've had all day!

18:51.826 --> 18:55.221
But I am not tying up
like some P.O.W.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.048
Yes, you are.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.530
Or what, cowboy?

19:03.838 --> 19:07.537
Ah.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.975
You know what I see?

19:11.019 --> 19:15.502
I see someone
that's pretending.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.679
Come on, man.
Let's go.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.769
Aah!

19:21.812 --> 19:23.379
Jesus.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.990
Did you just
trip me?

19:26.034 --> 19:28.123
What,
are you 12?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.386
What the hell
is wrong with you?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.823
I've been puttin' my neck
on a block for you people

19:32.867 --> 19:34.129
all goddamn day!

19:34.173 --> 19:36.610
You don't give a damn
about us.

19:36.653 --> 19:40.440
If you gave a shit,
you'd leave.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.878
That's what
everyone needs.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.621
I did
what I had to do back then.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.887
What did you say?

19:54.062 --> 19:56.107
No, no, no.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.414
Open that up.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.807
Tell me why

19:59.850 --> 20:03.506
the love of my life
had to die.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.031
Okay.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.643
One simple fact.

20:09.686 --> 20:13.255
One truth
kept my people going --

20:13.299 --> 20:16.040
if you don't protect
what belongs to you,

20:16.084 --> 20:17.433
then sooner or later,

20:17.477 --> 20:19.435
it belongs
to someone else.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.655
That goes for your land,
your wallet,

20:21.698 --> 20:24.440
your home, your country --
everything.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.008
It is your job as a man
to protect it.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.663
That's the story
of America,

20:29.706 --> 20:32.492
the story
of the whole goddamn world.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.450
And ain't nothing
changing it --

20:34.494 --> 20:37.758
not you,
not me, nobody.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.154
Are you saying that

20:43.198 --> 20:45.635
Eric's death
was my fault?

20:55.776 --> 20:58.082
Well...

20:58.126 --> 21:01.303
If I failed Eric...

21:01.347 --> 21:04.915
then you failed
your wife.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.745
Careful.
Yeah.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.878
She, uh...

21:10.921 --> 21:14.360
died hating you.

21:14.403 --> 21:18.277
And you will never
see her again.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.064
You wanna say something?

21:23.107 --> 21:24.892
Yeah.

21:24.935 --> 21:27.068
Behind you.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.180
Negan!

21:52.223 --> 21:53.790
Negan!

21:57.838 --> 21:59.970
All right.
I'll meet you back at the creek.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.972
Woman: Copy.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.545
No sign
of them anywhere.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.504
No traces, no tracks,
nothing.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.724
You're sure
you saw three?

22:15.769 --> 22:17.945
Yeah.
I'm sure.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.776
Carol...

22:22.819 --> 22:25.300
how long you been
taking those pills for?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.868
Since I got back.
It's fine.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.784
They're like coffee.
We can't stay out here.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.394
All right.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.440
Find a place
with walls,

22:34.483 --> 22:36.180
hole up
for a little while.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.357
Get some sleep.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.381
It's clear.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.324
Daryl: Hey.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.065
Come on.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.858
Michonne: You two,
get down here.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.947
Man: Gotcha.Keep watch
on the east end.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.994
I'll take first watch.All right.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.551
Negan!

25:46.632 --> 25:48.024
What?

25:48.068 --> 25:50.897
Nah, just thinking
'bout my dad.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.290
He was a trucker.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.771
He used to
tell Merle and I

25:55.815 --> 25:58.165
all these crazy stories
about his trips.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.864
This one time,

26:01.908 --> 26:05.781
he was flying through Kentucky
on I-66,

26:05.825 --> 26:07.870
and it's
pitch-black outside.

26:07.914 --> 26:10.786
He sees this girl
up on the side of the road,

26:10.830 --> 26:13.006
looks like
she's crying.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.224
As he gets closer,

26:14.268 --> 26:16.009
the girl steps right out
into the freeway,

26:16.052 --> 26:17.619
right in front
of his truck.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.058
He slams
on the brakes,

26:22.102 --> 26:23.930
calls the local PD,

26:23.973 --> 26:27.455
gets out,
and goes lookin' for her.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.500
Only she ain't there.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.721
He looks
under the cab, nothin'.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.202
Under the tires,
nope.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.117
She's not around.

26:37.160 --> 26:41.208
No dent in the grille,
no blood, no nothin'.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.123
How's that possible?

26:44.428 --> 26:47.040
There was no girl.

26:47.083 --> 26:50.434
See, my dad
didn't sleep much, either.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.220
Sometimes he'd stay up
24 hours

26:53.263 --> 26:55.352
just to make
one of his runs.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.311
You stay up that long,

26:57.354 --> 26:59.182
you start
seeing things.

26:59.226 --> 27:05.319
Daryl, I'm not a meth-snorting
truck driver like --

27:08.104 --> 27:11.368
Not that your dad,
uh...

27:11.412 --> 27:14.197
I'm sorry.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.204
No, you're right.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.687
Doesn't mean
I'm wrong, though.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.126
Shift's up.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.955
Don't take that.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.349
You need to sleep.

27:36.393 --> 27:39.222
I can't.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.531
Why's that?

27:43.574 --> 27:46.055
Bad dreams?

28:41.589 --> 28:43.634
Negan?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.943
Negan?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.862
You all right?

28:55.429 --> 28:58.171
Yeah.
How did you --

28:58.214 --> 29:00.303
Your light switched on.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.965
I can't see.

29:10.009 --> 29:13.926
Flowers growing outta
the walkers is hogweed.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.058
Hogweed?
Nasty shit.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.582
Causes rashes,
blindness.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.672
Is it permanent?
Sometimes.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.414
You wash
your eyes out?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.808
Yeah.
I used, uh...

29:26.852 --> 29:28.288
It's gone.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.290
Parched?

29:30.333 --> 29:31.595
Yeah.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.906
Here.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.344
Here we go.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.303
Here we go.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.524
All right.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.483
Right here.

29:52.312 --> 29:55.228
Wait.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.622
Where you going?

29:58.666 --> 30:01.364
I'm gonna keep watch.

30:01.408 --> 30:04.150
We'll leave
first thing in the morning.

30:04.193 --> 30:08.241
I mean,
if that's okay with you.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.418
Yeah.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.813
Yeah, it's okay.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.595
Henry: Mom?

31:01.033 --> 31:02.948
Mom.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.393
Daryl: Hey.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.437
You all right?

31:14.481 --> 31:16.352
Where'd you go?

31:16.396 --> 31:18.137
What?

31:18.180 --> 31:19.442
You've been gone
a half-hour.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.140
Uh...patrol.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.185
Thought I heard something.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.624
I'm fine.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.105
This isn't your dad
seeing a ghost.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.847
What?
The story
of the girl

31:32.891 --> 31:34.631
when your dad
was a truck driver.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.982
My dad
wasn't a truck driver.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.683
Shift's up.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.827
Come on.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.264
Don't take that.

32:03.443 --> 32:06.141
One more hour.

32:08.448 --> 32:11.146
One hour.

32:11.190 --> 32:14.149
All right.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.731
Aah!

34:14.226 --> 34:16.619
Help!

34:16.663 --> 34:18.360
Daryl! Help!

34:47.650 --> 34:49.435
Daryl: Carol!

34:57.356 --> 34:59.271
Doc!

34:59.314 --> 35:01.011
Siddiq:
What happened?

35:01.055 --> 35:02.448
She fell.
She cut her arm real bad.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.058
Easy.

35:05.799 --> 35:09.150
Gonna need you all
to leave.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.848
Okay,
you pull the shard,

35:11.892 --> 35:14.416
clamp open the wound,
and I'll go in.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.722
Dante:
Say the word.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.428
Good.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.827
You clamp.
I'll go in.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.829
I'm fine.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.832
You're not.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.228
Hey.

35:43.271 --> 35:46.187
It's okay.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.190
Here.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.762
Is she all right?

35:55.805 --> 35:58.417
She, um...

35:58.460 --> 35:59.679
I...

35:59.722 --> 36:01.855
He got it out.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.379
She's all patched up
and out like a light.

36:04.423 --> 36:05.989
Great.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.359
Can you see me?

36:29.361 --> 36:32.102
Yeah.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.019
Good.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.686
Rosita: Ugh!

36:50.730 --> 36:52.862
Damn.
I'm tired.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.473
You should be.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.127
You were mean
as a mama wasp out there.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.912
Yeah?
You were, uh...

36:58.955 --> 37:00.914
You were tough
as a...

37:00.957 --> 37:02.220
A stewed skunk?

37:02.263 --> 37:04.265
Batshit badger?

37:04.309 --> 37:06.006
Pissed-off penguin?

37:06.049 --> 37:07.616
All of the above.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.317
Rosita,
where's Coco?Probably sleeping.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.362
I think you confused my query
for "action"

37:14.406 --> 37:16.495
when I was trying
to discern "locale."

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
She's with Barbara.

37:18.061 --> 37:20.325
Is that okay?
It's just...

37:20.368 --> 37:23.937
that little nugget can't grow up
without her mama.

37:23.980 --> 37:26.418
I went out with you today
to protect you

37:26.461 --> 37:28.550
because I care about you.Protect me?

37:28.594 --> 37:30.465
I taught you
how to fight.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.079
Rosita, I --

37:36.123 --> 37:38.299
Damn it, Eugene!

37:38.343 --> 37:41.041
You and I
are never going to happen.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.173
You are not
Coco's father.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.436
We are not together.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.481
I need you
to hear that.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.834
I...

37:51.878 --> 37:53.358
I'm sorry
that was harsh.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.011
I'm...

37:55.055 --> 37:57.362
I'm just --
I'm so tired.

37:57.405 --> 38:00.452
I feel...drunk.

38:03.977 --> 38:06.371
Oh, God.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.462
Are you familiar
with the expression,

38:10.505 --> 38:12.420
"A drunk mind
speaks a sober heart?"

38:12.464 --> 38:13.813
No.

38:13.856 --> 38:17.556
When under the influence,
inhibitions are lowered.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.384
Secrets and truths
pour out.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.168
Pun intended.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.257
Sleep deprivation
lowers inhibition,

38:23.301 --> 38:25.564
enhances impulsivity
in a similar manner.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.567
Thus, when you say,
"It's not gonna happen,"

38:28.610 --> 38:31.221
it's unfiltered truth
straight from your ticker.

38:31.265 --> 38:34.224
I've been trying
to tell you that.

38:34.268 --> 38:37.315
And I did not listen.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.535
'Cause I thought that,
perhaps someday,

38:40.579 --> 38:42.798
there might be
something special

38:42.842 --> 38:45.671
between you
and yours truly.

38:46.802 --> 38:50.240
But there's nothing there.
There never was.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.071
You think that our friendship
is just nothing?

38:55.115 --> 38:57.596
Is that
your unfiltered truth?

39:02.644 --> 39:06.953
I don't mean to eat sorrow
by the spoonful in front of you,

39:06.996 --> 39:08.607
but I'm in the midst

39:08.650 --> 39:13.351
of experiencing
a crushing moment of clarity.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.266
Our --
Our whole friendship

39:16.310 --> 39:18.486
is premised on
my mistaken belief that,

39:18.530 --> 39:21.533
perhaps someday, I could
change your mind, that...

39:21.576 --> 39:24.274
you would see that
I was worthy enough

39:24.318 --> 39:28.191
of being re-zoned
into love-town.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.891
What kind of friend
is that?

39:31.934 --> 39:33.632
I'm sorry.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.503
Eugene...

39:35.547 --> 39:36.722
I'm sorry.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.740
Michonne:
Still awake?

39:54.783 --> 39:57.569
Yeah.
You and me both.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.754
How you holding up?

40:08.797 --> 40:11.452
I should
be asking you that.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.280
I'm a mother.

40:13.323 --> 40:16.152
Lack of sleep
is my baseline reality.

40:16.196 --> 40:19.460
You had that look
in the meeting hall...

40:20.766 --> 40:22.420
I'm a father.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.424
I'm just -- I'm tired.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.296
Tired.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.645
Yeah.

40:30.689 --> 40:31.820
Okay.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.693
See you later?
Yeah.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.695
We'll be
good as new.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.306
Speak for
your damn self.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.274
Okay.
Come on, man.

40:51.318 --> 40:52.711
I -- Look,
I gotta go to sleep.
Oh, no.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.191
That's why
I brought it over.

40:59.152 --> 41:02.764
You know
I saw combat in Iraq?

41:02.808 --> 41:04.636
Yeah,
I was a field medic.

41:04.679 --> 41:07.116
And you are
telling me this now?

41:07.160 --> 41:10.990
Well, I don't like talking
about it unless I have to, so...

41:16.778 --> 41:20.086
Cheers.

41:30.009 --> 41:34.666
You go in one person,
come out different.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.932
I knew this one guy --

41:39.975 --> 41:42.238
Shit,
everyone knew him.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.413
Cocky.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.590
Broad-shouldered,
Adonis-looking cat.

41:48.418 --> 41:51.813
Like, this was the dude
that never broke.

41:53.859 --> 41:56.339
Until he did.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.429
Lost his squad
in Fallujah.

41:59.473 --> 42:01.693
Blamed himself.

42:03.129 --> 42:05.827
Came back with the shakes,
the thousand-mile stare,

42:05.871 --> 42:09.439
the flashbacks,
going in and out of VAs.

42:09.483 --> 42:10.832
He was a mess...

42:10.876 --> 42:13.182
"He was"?
"Was"?

42:13.226 --> 42:16.272
What -- What happened
to this guy?

42:17.796 --> 42:20.363
You're having a drink
with him.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.366
Sorry.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.805
"Adonis-looking cat"?

42:26.848 --> 42:28.807
Oh.
God of beauty, baby.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.504
I'm just
being humble.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.815
♪ Good morning to you

42:36.858 --> 42:42.864
♪ I hope you're feeling better,
baby ♪

42:42.908 --> 42:48.174
♪ Thinking of me
while you are far away ♪

42:49.479 --> 42:51.090
Hey.
Hey.

42:51.133 --> 42:56.008
♪ Counting the days until they set you free again

42:56.051 --> 42:59.751
Oh. We need jam.

42:59.794 --> 43:02.144
Oh. There's probably some
at the store.

43:02.188 --> 43:03.493
Hold on.

43:05.713 --> 43:09.412
There you go.
Thank you.

43:10.849 --> 43:13.373
You sure
they're open right now?

43:15.418 --> 43:16.724
Henry: Mom?

43:17.856 --> 43:20.380
Where you going?

43:49.757 --> 43:51.977
How is it?

43:54.414 --> 43:57.243
Hurts.

43:58.331 --> 43:59.985
Being back here
hurts, too.

44:00.028 --> 44:01.247
And that's her fault.

44:01.290 --> 44:02.901
You shouldn't have
stopped me.

44:02.944 --> 44:05.164
There were seven of us
out there.

44:05.207 --> 44:07.122
I had to
think of them.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.471
I know.

44:09.995 --> 44:12.867
But I did see them.

44:16.001 --> 44:18.612
Only you did.

44:28.622 --> 44:30.798
Is it safe?

44:32.626 --> 44:35.324
For now.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.445
Pink suits you.

45:15.408 --> 45:16.801
She doesn't believe me.

45:26.854 --> 45:27.855
Do you?

45:32.730 --> 45:33.731
Yeah.
