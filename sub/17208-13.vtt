NARRATOR:

00:01.669 --> 00:03.838
Hola,<i> friends. As you know,</i>

00:01.669 --> 00:03.838
<i>Jane's husband died.</i>

00:03.838 --> 00:05.339
<i>But three years later...</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.424
A publisher wants to buy

00:05.339 --> 00:07.424
my novel about Michael.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.677
NARRATOR:

00:07.424 --> 00:09.677
<i>So sweet, right?</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.677
<i>But you know who hasn't</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:12.387
<i>been that sweet lately?</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:12.387
<i>Mr. Sweetface.</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:13.889
<i>So Jane and Rafael</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:13.889
<i>decided to take</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:15.683
<i>some action</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:15.683
<i>and get him an aide.</i>

00:15.683 --> 00:17.810
<i>And as for Jane's parents,</i>

00:15.683 --> 00:17.810
<i>well, they weren't</i>

00:17.810 --> 00:20.312
<i>on such great terms, because</i>

00:17.810 --> 00:20.312
<i>Xo learned that Ro agreed</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.940
<i>to frame her as the evil ex</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.940
<i>on his reality show.</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.860
<i>Good thing Xo has</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.860
<i>her super cute lawyer boyfriend</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:27.110
<i>to lean on.</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:28.737
<i>And as for Rogelio, well,</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.990
<i>he decided to quit</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.990
The De La Vega-Factor Factor,

00:30.990 --> 00:33.492
<i>which felt great until...</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:33.492
<i>ROGELIO:I'm being sued</i>

00:33.492 --> 00:35.452
for $10 million

00:33.492 --> 00:35.452
for breach of contract.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.579
NARRATOR:

00:35.452 --> 00:37.579
<i>I know! Holy cow!</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:40.040
<i>Oh, that reminds me.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:40.040
<i>Remember Chuck Chesser,</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.500
<i>owner of the hotel next door?</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:43.418
<i>Well, Petra's been sleeping</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:43.418
<i>with him.</i>

00:43.418 --> 00:46.296
<i>But now Chuck actually likes</i>

00:43.418 --> 00:46.296
<i>her. But Petra has a secret.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:48.298
<i>See, there was a body found</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:48.298
<i>on the beach,</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.885
<i>right between the Marbella</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.885
<i>and the Fairwick. And Petra--</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:52.051
<i>well, I'll show you...</i>

00:52.051 --> 00:53.721
( thunder crashing )

00:52.051 --> 00:53.721
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:53.721 --> 00:55.931
<i>So that, friends,</i>

00:53.721 --> 00:55.931
<i>is where we...</i>

00:55.931 --> 00:58.559
<i>Oh, wait. Shoot.</i>

00:55.931 --> 00:58.559
<i>I forgot about Abbey.</i>

00:58.559 --> 01:01.228
<i>Abbey is Raf's girlfriend,</i>

00:58.559 --> 01:01.228
<i>and she's really nice.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.605
<i>Which is why I hope Raf</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.605
<i>isn't up to something shady.</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:04.899
<i>Though it sure seems like it.</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:07.609
<i>And that's really where</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:07.609
<i>we left off.</i>

01:09.945 --> 01:13.240
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

01:09.945 --> 01:13.240
<i>was 27 years</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:14.575
<i>and 14 days old,</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:16.535
<i>she lost her voice...</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:18.370
( hoarsely ):

01:16.535 --> 01:18.370
I'm sorry, Mr. Sweetface.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.873
I can't sing to you.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.873
I can barely talk.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.458
Daddy! Daddy!

01:20.873 --> 01:23.458
Daddy already sang two songs.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.045
Enough. Time for bedtime.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.045
I love you.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.342
More stalling?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.887
Thanks. I don't know

01:32.342 --> 01:34.887
how I lost my voice.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.931
I feel fine.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.473
What?

01:38.473 --> 01:40.392
I have a few things on my mind,

01:40.392 --> 01:42.269
so I'm gonna go ahead

01:40.392 --> 01:42.269
and take advantage

01:42.269 --> 01:44.396
of this whole you-can't-talk

01:42.269 --> 01:44.396
situation.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.607
Well, that's a lit--

01:44.396 --> 01:46.607
Shh. So, per our deal

01:46.607 --> 01:49.026
to keep each other informed...

01:49.026 --> 01:50.861
I'm dating someone.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.195
It's getting

01:50.861 --> 01:52.195
a little serious.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.655
Her name is Abbey.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.365
What? When did you--

01:53.655 --> 01:55.365
Shh.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.617
Don't use your voice.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.243
That's all I want

01:56.617 --> 01:58.243
to say about it. Next,

01:58.243 --> 01:59.995
it's time for you

01:58.243 --> 01:59.995
to start writing again.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.289
Yes, I know--

01:59.995 --> 02:02.289
you haven't made progress

02:02.289 --> 02:03.707
on the Venezuela novel.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.500
So write something new.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.003
It's been...

02:08.003 --> 02:09.880
long enough.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.091
You have to start.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.718
It's not that easy.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.718
It doesn't even have to be good.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.928
( scoffs )

02:14.718 --> 02:15.928
Just write.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.471
About anything.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.722
Uh, Kim and Kanye.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.183
The-the history of...

02:18.722 --> 02:22.183
throat lozenges.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.644
The history of...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.604
Florida.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.148
It-it doesn't matter,

02:25.604 --> 02:28.148
okay?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.067
Just flex the muscle.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.445
Okay. That's all my wisdom

02:30.067 --> 02:33.445
for the night.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.156
I have a date.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.156
I need details.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.741
Depends on how many pages I get.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
( sighs )

02:39.409 --> 02:40.744
NARRATOR:

02:39.409 --> 02:40.744
<i>Come on,</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:43.288
<i>you know he's right.</i>

02:43.288 --> 02:45.082
( door closes )

02:43.288 --> 02:45.082
( groans softly )

02:46.374 --> 02:48.460
( sighing )

02:54.215 --> 02:56.510
<i>Aw, I was hoping</i>

02:54.215 --> 02:56.510
<i>she'd go with lozenges.</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.428
<i>A medicine</i> and<i> a candy!</i>

02:58.428 --> 03:02.432
<i>But anyway, the point is</i>

02:58.428 --> 03:02.432
<i>Jane began to read...</i>

03:02.432 --> 03:04.893
(<i> light theme playing</i> )

03:14.862 --> 03:17.031
( sighs )

03:17.031 --> 03:18.782
You got this.

03:23.495 --> 03:28.291
NARRATOR:

03:23.495 --> 03:28.291
<i>And that, my friends,</i>

03:23.495 --> 03:28.291
<i>is how Jane got her voice back.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:30.794
<i>And since then, well,</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:32.838
<i>she used it nonstop.</i>

03:32.838 --> 03:34.965
You are being ridiculous.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.965
<i>See what I mean?</i>

03:34.965 --> 03:36.884
Of course I'm excited

03:34.965 --> 03:36.884
to meet my editor.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.677
I was just expecting a woman,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.677
because...

03:38.677 --> 03:40.012
You trust women

03:38.677 --> 03:40.012
more than men.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.513
So not true!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.140
You do. Admit it.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.140
You have a bias.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.766
You didn't

03:43.140 --> 03:44.766
even consider hiring Alex.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.147
I considered him.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.147
He's just...

03:50.147 --> 03:51.565
not as good as Carly.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.858
Nope.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.985
You only trust

03:52.858 --> 03:54.985
female authority figures.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.570
It's a pattern.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
NARRATOR:

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
<i>Wow. I've never noticed</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
<i>that before,</i>

03:58.739 --> 04:00.782
<i>but it's so true!</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:04.578
Okay, if it's slightly true,

04:04.578 --> 04:07.206
it's not my fault-- I've just

04:04.578 --> 04:07.206
always been surrounded by women.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.750
( chuckles )

04:07.206 --> 04:09.750
But, fine,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.752
I'll check my bias

04:09.750 --> 04:11.752
from now on. Happy?

04:11.752 --> 04:14.379
( phone chimes )

04:14.379 --> 04:16.506
Everything okay?

04:14.379 --> 04:16.506
Yeah, it's Abbey.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.633
She just wants

04:16.506 --> 04:18.633
to have a talk later.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.594
NARRATOR:

04:18.633 --> 04:20.594
<i>Huh, she seemed fine</i>

04:18.633 --> 04:20.594
<i>this morning.</i>

04:20.594 --> 04:22.096
Uh-oh.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.096
Mateo,

04:22.096 --> 04:23.346
are you excited to meet

04:23.346 --> 04:25.015
your new special friend

04:23.346 --> 04:25.015
Carly today?

04:25.015 --> 04:28.060
( Mateo shouting )

04:25.015 --> 04:28.060
Oh, man. Come here. Come here.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.437
( in Spanish ):

04:28.060 --> 04:30.437
Use your words.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.189
( in English ):

04:30.437 --> 04:32.189
Yes, I'm excited!

04:32.189 --> 04:34.608
Good. You're gonna

04:32.189 --> 04:34.608
love her!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.859
( gibberish sound )

04:34.608 --> 04:35.859
Mwah!

04:35.859 --> 04:37.485
Do you think

04:35.859 --> 04:37.485
he loves her?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.487
I can't tell.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.487
He won't turn around.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.407
( gasps )

04:39.487 --> 04:42.407
I think she just said

04:39.487 --> 04:42.407
"Good job, Mateo."

04:42.407 --> 04:44.659
Or was it

04:42.407 --> 04:44.659
"Stop that, Mateo"?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.578
NARRATOR:

04:44.659 --> 04:46.578
<i>Looked to me like</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:46.578
<i>"Screw you, Mateo,"</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:48.163
<i>but I think</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:48.163
<i>I'm just really bad at this.</i>

04:48.163 --> 04:49.664
Okay,

04:48.163 --> 04:49.664
this is crazy.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.166
We have to go

04:49.664 --> 04:51.166
before we get caught.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.210
I know. You're right.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.210
Going.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.253
Wait, what?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.589
( inaudible )

05:02.970 --> 05:05.305
( whirring )

05:09.559 --> 05:12.146
( keys clacking )

05:15.983 --> 05:19.194
Oh, Jane, Raf.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.194
Hey, Stacy.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.738
So, how are things going

05:19.194 --> 05:21.738
with Mateo's new aide?

05:21.738 --> 05:25.242
I completely get why you need

05:21.738 --> 05:25.242
the extra help.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.285
( chuckles )

05:26.285 --> 05:27.327
What a relief,

05:27.327 --> 05:28.578
huh?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.578
RAFAEL: Yeah.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.955
It really is.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.248
JANE:

05:29.955 --> 05:31.248
<i>What a bitch!</i>

05:31.248 --> 05:32.749
Can you believe her?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.918
What? She was nice.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.212
Nice? Didn't you

05:34.918 --> 05:37.212
hear her tone?

05:37.212 --> 05:39.256
I think you're being

05:37.212 --> 05:39.256
a little sensitive.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.256
No.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.133
Trust me,

05:39.256 --> 05:41.133
this is a mean girl thing.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.177
You just don't get it

05:41.133 --> 05:43.177
because you're a man.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.304
NARRATOR:

05:43.177 --> 05:45.304
<i>Yep. There's that gender bias.</i>

05:45.304 --> 05:47.139
Who's never experienced

05:45.304 --> 05:47.139
mean girls.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.932
Or maybe you're just

05:47.139 --> 05:48.932
a little extra sensitive

05:48.932 --> 05:50.976
because you're feeling insecure

05:48.932 --> 05:50.976
about Mateo.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.270
Maybe. We'll see.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.230
I have to go meet

05:53.270 --> 05:55.230
with my editor.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.523
With my open mind.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.859
Good luck with Abbey.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.859
Yeah. Thanks.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.195
I'm thinking she just wants

05:58.859 --> 06:01.195
to come to the fundraiser,

06:01.195 --> 06:02.946
you know, get involved

06:01.195 --> 06:02.946
with school stuff.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.489
I want to move in.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.489
NARRATOR:<i> Oh.</i>

06:04.489 --> 06:05.615
<i>Wow.</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:07.284
( keyboard clacking )

06:09.619 --> 06:10.912
You look shocked.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.956
Surprised.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.956
It's been over a year.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.373
Where did you think

06:12.956 --> 06:14.373
we were headed?

06:14.373 --> 06:16.084
Right here. Of course.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.752
I just, you know,

06:16.084 --> 06:17.752
didn't expect today.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.880
I know. It's...

06:17.752 --> 06:19.880
a little out of the blue.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.340
Exactly.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.340
You know?

06:21.340 --> 06:23.717
Um, I just thought

06:21.340 --> 06:23.717
you wanted to come with me

06:23.717 --> 06:25.177
to the fundraiser.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.177
( chuckles )

06:26.303 --> 06:27.888
I assumed

06:26.303 --> 06:27.888
I'd be going to that.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.973
( overlapping arguing )

06:29.973 --> 06:31.599
No...

06:29.973 --> 06:31.599
I mean, I'm here all the time.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.643
You have the--

06:31.599 --> 06:33.643
Don't say I have that drawer.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.146
A dramatic way of

06:33.643 --> 06:36.146
bringing it up.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.398
Look, this is a

06:36.146 --> 06:39.398
big deal, because

06:39.398 --> 06:42.569
it affects Mateo

06:39.398 --> 06:42.569
and Anna and Ellie, too.

KRISHNA: Mr. Solano, I...

06:49.743 --> 06:50.952
Oh, excuse me.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
Oh, no, that's okay.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
I was just leaving.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.289
No, it's...

06:52.453 --> 06:54.289

Oh... please. No.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.601
That's not true.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.770
We're having lunch

07:14.601 --> 07:16.770

07:16.770 --> 07:18.397
At 11:00 a.m.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.566
Yeah. Well, I happen

07:18.397 --> 07:21.566
to love the food here.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.193
Early.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.153
I know you moved

07:23.193 --> 07:25.153
the bones, ma'am.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.363
What?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.448
I said watch out

07:26.363 --> 07:28.448

07:28.448 --> 07:30.784
What is going

07:28.448 --> 07:30.784

07:33.036 --> 07:34.704
Okay, fine.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.704
You know what?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.539
You're right.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.749
I am a little embarrassed.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.043
And, uh... and I know

07:37.749 --> 07:40.043
I shouldn't be.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.587
So, tomorrow...

08:07.737 --> 08:10.198
your book.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.242
You crushed it.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.035
Thank you. So much.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.037
It was epic. I swear,

Great. I really wanted it

08:44.607 --> 08:46.734
And Detective Martin

almost getting shot

08:46.734 --> 08:48.778
on his wedding night, but not!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.238
And then catching

08:48.778 --> 08:50.238
the villain,

08:50.238 --> 08:52.407
who ended up being

08:50.238 --> 08:52.407

Hella happy ending!

08:53.700 --> 08:54.909
Ba-boom!

08:54.909 --> 08:57.287
But I need

08:54.909 --> 08:57.287

09:01.958 --> 09:04.836
Look at Rake,

09:01.958 --> 09:04.836
the robber baron character.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.671
I feel like he could be more...

09:06.671 --> 09:08.840
bam, boom, bang!

09:11.426 --> 09:12.427

12:47.434 --> 12:48.935
<i>sound familiar?</i>

12:48.935 --> 12:50.853
( keyboard clacking )

12:52.439 --> 12:54.482
STACY:

12:52.439 --> 12:54.482
Yeah, we were just

12:52.439 --> 12:54.482
discussing the upcoming

12:54.482 --> 12:56.192
field trip.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.192
I'm the only parent going,

12:56.192 --> 12:57.318
and it's a lot of kids

12:57.318 --> 12:58.570
to handle on my own.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.862
That's all I meant.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.197
Gotcha.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.949
Oh! So sorry about that.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.160
And it's really nice

13:04.409 --> 13:06.160
to meet you, Gwen.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.537
Um, can I say,

13:07.537 --> 13:10.164
we are so happy

13:07.537 --> 13:10.164
to be here at your school?

13:10.164 --> 13:13.501
NARRATOR:

13:10.164 --> 13:13.501
<i>I know. I can't watch, either.</i>

13:18.214 --> 13:20.759
RAFAEL:

13:18.214 --> 13:20.759
It's a great card.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.762
Really beautiful, hon.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.762
NARRATOR:<i> Kiss ass.</i>

13:23.762 --> 13:25.930
But what about what I wrote

13:23.762 --> 13:25.930
<i>in</i> the card? Is that great?

13:25.930 --> 13:27.974
I mean, it's an apology

13:25.930 --> 13:27.974
for being rude,

13:27.974 --> 13:30.769
so I think "great"

13:27.974 --> 13:30.769
is probably hard to achieve.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.229
So no?

13:30.769 --> 13:33.229
Jane, Gwen is not gonna kick

13:33.229 --> 13:34.397
Mateo out of school.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.565
No, but he'll definitely get

13:35.565 --> 13:37.066
the bad teacher

13:35.565 --> 13:37.066
for kindergarten.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.068
Okay, girls,

13:39.068 --> 13:41.237
why don't you go play with

13:39.068 --> 13:41.237
your brother in the playroom?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.490
Poor Mateo.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.533
I know. Let's hug him.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.161
You must make this right.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.037
Look, if Gwen doesn't like you,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.037
you're screwed.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.372
Or rather, Mateo's screwed.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.624
He'll get no special attention,

13:52.624 --> 13:53.958
he'll get all the bad teachers.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.127
I'm fixing it. I wrote

13:53.958 --> 13:56.127
a long apology note.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.422
Words don't mean anything.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.422
Only actions do.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.299
Okay, there's a final

13:59.422 --> 14:01.299
planning committee

14:01.299 --> 14:02.717
for the annual fundraiser

14:01.299 --> 14:02.717
tomorrow.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.385
Gwen will be there,

14:02.717 --> 14:04.385
and so will you.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.471
This is important, Jane!

14:04.385 --> 14:06.471
Plus, everything

14:06.471 --> 14:08.515
you do reflects on me because

14:06.471 --> 14:08.515
I'm the one who got you in.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.849
XIOMARA:

14:08.515 --> 14:10.849
<i>My reputation was ruined.</i>

14:10.849 --> 14:12.935
Strangers confronted me

14:10.849 --> 14:12.935
at the grocery store.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.895
Someone gave me the finger

14:12.935 --> 14:14.895
at a red light

14:14.895 --> 14:16.939
and called me a slut.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.939
It was awful.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.776
For the record, I want

14:16.939 --> 14:19.776
to reiterate how sorry I am

14:19.776 --> 14:21.944
for the part I played

14:19.776 --> 14:21.944
in causing this.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.198
Okay. Got it. I think

14:21.944 --> 14:25.198
that's all we need.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.284
Sounds like they assassinated

14:25.198 --> 14:28.284
your character.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.745
Great, great stuff.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.372
For our case.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.332
Hopefully, we won't need

14:32.372 --> 14:34.332
to use any of it, though.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.500
Much better to mediate.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.460
That's right,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.460
in the media.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
What?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
I am gonna drag

14:39.462 --> 14:41.798
this company's name

14:39.462 --> 14:41.798
through the mud so hard,

14:41.798 --> 14:44.551
they beg us to settle!

14:41.798 --> 14:44.551
<i>( jaguar roaring )</i>

14:44.551 --> 14:46.845
I<i> love</i> this guy.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.513
I don't like this guy.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.598
Trying to shame

14:48.513 --> 14:50.598
the production-- it's risky.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.517
Well, there's

14:50.598 --> 14:52.517
nothing we can do.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.603
You could talk to

14:52.517 --> 14:55.603
Rogelio about it.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.603
( laughs )

14:55.603 --> 14:57.564
Oh, come on! The sooner

14:55.603 --> 14:57.564
this case is over,

14:57.564 --> 14:59.774
the better it

14:57.564 --> 14:59.774
will be for you.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.235
Fine. As long as

14:59.774 --> 15:02.235
you do it with me.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.237
Of course.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.655
We're a team.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.490
NARRATOR:

15:05.655 --> 15:07.490
<i>And speaking of teamwork...</i>

15:07.490 --> 15:10.618
Thank you again to Petra

15:07.490 --> 15:10.618
for donating

15:10.618 --> 15:12.412
the use of the Marbella.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.955
And thank you to

15:12.412 --> 15:14.955
the planning committee.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.792
Your hard work

15:14.955 --> 15:17.792
has been inspiring.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.419

15:19.419 --> 15:22.672
Monte Carlo night is going to be

15:19.419 --> 15:22.672
our best fundraiser yet.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.674
STACY: Agreed. Absolutely.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.674
Mm.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.552
All right, so, any more auction

15:24.674 --> 15:27.552
items to add, ladies?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.596
Yes, um, my sister can

15:27.552 --> 15:29.596
donate courtside seats

15:29.596 --> 15:31.389
to the Heat game.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.389
Oh.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.391
And I secured those

15:31.389 --> 15:33.391

<i>Say something!</i>

15:37.186 --> 15:40.481
Um, well,

15:37.186 --> 15:40.481
I was thinking,

15:40.481 --> 15:43.526
uh, maybe if we lose

15:40.481 --> 15:43.526
the second fountain,

15:43.526 --> 15:45.945
we could make room for another

15:43.526 --> 15:45.945
table to make extra money.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.281
I mean, looking at the budget,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.281
those fountains

15:48.281 --> 15:49.908
are a fortune, and the point is

15:49.908 --> 15:51.659
to raise money for the school,

15:49.908 --> 15:51.659
not spend it.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.077
GWEN:

15:51.659 --> 15:53.077
We<i> need</i>

15:53.077 --> 15:54.412
the second fountain.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.581
No one is going to

15:54.412 --> 15:56.581
pull out their wallets

15:56.581 --> 15:59.083
to donate if

15:56.581 --> 15:59.083
the event isn't great.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.585
Huge mistake.

we decided on

16:03.755 --> 16:05.799
last month.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.676
Okay, so we need three more

people to work tomorrow night.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.053
Any volunteers?

Not funny.

Sorry. Just distracted.

Abbey?

16:26.277 --> 16:29.489
Do you think I should do it?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.115
Yeah. Probably.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.533
Abbey's great.

No, the book.

I mean, I-I don't think I am.

everything under control.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.074
Well, I appreciate that.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.076
Of course.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.538
And I'm so sorry again

26:17.076 --> 26:20.538
about the yelling.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.165
I've been stressed out

26:20.538 --> 26:23.165
about Mateo and obviously

26:23.165 --> 26:25.876
overly sensitive. And when

26:23.165 --> 26:25.876
I thought someone was saying

26:25.876 --> 26:27.669
mean things about him,

26:27.669 --> 26:29.463
I just lashed out.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.215
I guess

26:29.463 --> 26:31.215
because it preys

26:31.215 --> 26:33.633
on my insecurities.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.633
Which I'm working on.

26:33.633 --> 26:37.054
Well, parents are

26:33.633 --> 26:37.054
their kids' fiercest advocates.

26:37.054 --> 26:41.559
( chuckles )

26:37.054 --> 26:41.559
Just bring the fierce

26:37.054 --> 26:41.559
down a notch from now on.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.561
Got it. Done.

26:43.561 --> 26:46.730
And, of course,

26:43.561 --> 26:46.730
I asked Stacy to back off.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.315
She can be a real bitch.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.109
See?

26:50.109 --> 26:51.985
I gave her the

26:50.109 --> 26:51.985
benefit of the doubt.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.320
She's always been

26:51.985 --> 26:53.320
so nice to me.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.448
No kidding.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.448
Big surprise.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.743
I'll just go take

26:58.409 --> 26:59.743
these glasses out.

PETRA:

26:59.743 --> 27:01.078
<i>No, no, don't refill it.</i>

27:01.078 --> 27:02.580
I'll just take a fresh one.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.872
Oh...

27:05.499 --> 27:07.793
Hey.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.462
Everything okay?

27:09.462 --> 27:12.214
Yeah.

Yeah, your Czech only

27:17.261 --> 27:19.012
when you've had too much

27:17.261 --> 27:19.012
to drink. So...

27:21.348 --> 27:22.849
What's wrong?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.645
It's Chuck.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.731
He won't answer my texts.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.649
He thinks I'm<i> rozpacích.</i>

27:31.649 --> 27:32.859
Em-Embarrassed.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.320
Embarrassed of him.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.072
Okay. Well, are you?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.782
Obviously, yes.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.618
He's rude.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.827
He's... coarse.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.621
He slurps when he eats.

NARRATOR:

27:49.168 --> 27:51.920
Well, I guess you can't choose

27:49.168 --> 27:51.920
who you fall for, right?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.965
You also can't choose

27:51.920 --> 27:54.965
who you aren't falling for.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.010
Look, you know I like Abbey.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.720
I mean, she's so nice.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.599
But you obviously don't want

28:00.720 --> 28:03.599
to move in with her.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.977
So just tell her already,

I'm drunk.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.780
<i>Ya think?</i>

28:18.780 --> 28:19.865
So I'm gonna go.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.825
Okay.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.244
Petra out.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.582
Get home safely.

NARRATOR:

28:28.582 --> 28:31.418
<i>Yeah. Who said</i>

28:28.582 --> 28:31.418
<i>she was going home?</i>

28:33.337 --> 28:35.047
I know.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.132
You're mad because you think

28:35.047 --> 28:37.132
I'm embarrassed of you.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.175
And you know what?

28:38.175 --> 28:39.426
Maybe I am.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.428
But I don't want to be, okay?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.472
Because I like you.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.475
And I-I just want to...

28:43.472 --> 28:46.475
( speaks Czech )

28:48.686 --> 28:52.189
And I know, I know you don't

28:48.686 --> 28:52.189
know what that means, but...

28:52.189 --> 28:54.858
you're gonna be very happy

28:52.189 --> 28:54.858
when you find out.

NARRATOR:

Villanue-bomb in

29:14.670 --> 29:17.464
before the deadline.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.301
( sighs )

29:19.132 --> 29:21.301
Yeah.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.720
Well, I just wanted

29:21.301 --> 29:22.720
to talk to you.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.054
Psyched.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.723
Because...

29:25.723 --> 29:27.600
I just don't think

29:25.723 --> 29:27.600
that we're a good fit.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.643
Less psyched.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.643
I'm sorry.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.145
I tried implementing your notes,

29:29.643 --> 29:32.145
but they don't work for me.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.106
Jane--

29:32.145 --> 29:34.106
And I just really don't think

29:34.106 --> 29:35.982
that my book needs

29:34.106 --> 29:35.982
any more external obstacles.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.943
The Rake storyline was

29:35.982 --> 29:37.943
always supposed to be simple.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.613
Josephine loved him,

29:37.943 --> 29:40.613
he got her pregnant...

29:40.613 --> 29:43.115
Wait, Josephine loved Rake?

29:43.115 --> 29:44.700
That didn't

29:43.115 --> 29:44.700
come through at all.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.701
It didn't?

29:45.701 --> 29:47.035
No, it read like

29:47.035 --> 29:48.579
an olden times one-night stand.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.665
Oh.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.665
But that could be

29:48.579 --> 29:51.665
the missing obstacle, right?

29:51.665 --> 29:55.419
Boom. Josephine's conflicted

29:51.665 --> 29:55.419
feelings in this love triangle.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.129
That would be enough?

29:55.419 --> 29:57.129
Of course.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.672
Dude, I'm sorry.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.467
I never meant that the obstacles

29:58.672 --> 30:01.467
had to be external.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.843
I just threw something out

30:01.467 --> 30:03.843
there. You seemed to latch on.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.220
I thought

30:03.843 --> 30:05.220
I had to take your note.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.513
No!

30:06.513 --> 30:08.848
This is all a part

30:06.513 --> 30:08.848
of a long conversation.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.727
That's how an editor-writer

30:08.848 --> 30:11.727
relationship works.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.646
Oh. Wow.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.646
( chuckling ): Yeah!

30:13.646 --> 30:15.773
Of course I want your voice,

30:13.646 --> 30:15.773
Jane!

30:15.773 --> 30:18.275
That's why I bought

30:15.773 --> 30:18.275
your hella good book.

30:18.275 --> 30:21.987
So, look, you can handle

30:18.275 --> 30:21.987
these notes however you'd like.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.364
It sounds like beefing up

30:21.987 --> 30:24.364
the baller love triangle

30:24.364 --> 30:25.658
is the most natural thing to do.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.005
like you so much, dude.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.215
Thanks.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.092
You're hella awesome.

( in Spanish ):

30:47.137 --> 30:51.308
When do I get to appear

30:47.137 --> 30:51.308
in this story?

30:51.308 --> 30:55.103
You know I've got a lot

30:51.308 --> 30:55.103
of wisdom I could share.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.858
( in English ):

30:56.938 --> 30:59.858
I just can't write it,

30:56.938 --> 30:59.858
Abuela.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.986
Somehow, deepening

30:59.858 --> 31:02.986
Josephine's love for Rake

31:02.986 --> 31:05.864
feels like a betrayal

31:02.986 --> 31:05.864
of Michael. Martin.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.659
( in Spanish ):

31:06.948 --> 31:08.659
It's not nothing.

31:08.659 --> 31:11.119
( in English ):

31:08.659 --> 31:11.119
And intellectually,

31:08.659 --> 31:11.119
I know that...

31:11.119 --> 31:13.079
Mm.

31:13.079 --> 31:16.041
( in Spanish ):

31:13.079 --> 31:16.041
Here's how I see it.

31:16.041 --> 31:19.545
The fact that

31:16.041 --> 31:19.545
you loved Rafael...

31:19.545 --> 31:24.424
well that experience deepened

31:19.545 --> 31:24.424
your love for Michael.

31:26.051 --> 31:31.056
And when you found your way back

31:26.051 --> 31:31.056
to him, it was richer.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.392
Because you chose him.

31:36.144 --> 31:40.065
So, maybe,

31:36.144 --> 31:40.065
love begets love.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.028
( in English ):

31:43.235 --> 31:45.028
Yeah.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.405
Maybe.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.702
( in Spanish ):

31:49.783 --> 31:51.702
Here's what I do know

31:49.783 --> 31:51.702
for sure.

31:53.328 --> 31:58.166
Michael would want you to

31:53.328 --> 31:58.166
write the best book you could.

NARRATOR ( in English ):

She is ridiculously stubborn!

He completely betrayed me!

Hey! Enough!

32:45.881 --> 32:47.716
You're both here,

32:45.881 --> 32:47.716
so we're gonna work this out,

32:47.716 --> 32:50.009
because you have a child

32:47.716 --> 32:50.009
and a grandchild together

32:50.009 --> 32:51.261
and everybody in your life

when you're getting along.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.265
Including the two

are you willing to concede

32:58.435 --> 33:02.481
Yeah.

32:58.435 --> 33:02.481
And you, Rogelio?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.232
Yes.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.444
I'm so much happier

Rogelio, do you concede

33:10.739 --> 33:14.785
that you screwed up?

33:14.785 --> 33:16.536
Massively, yes.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.996
And swear never

to do it again,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.415
under penalty

33:17.996 --> 33:20.415
of never speaking?

33:20.415 --> 33:22.960
You have my word.

What's that nod mean,

Xiomara?

33:25.671 --> 33:26.880
Do you forgive him?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.925
Then tell him!

33:33.052 --> 33:34.805
I forgive you.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.599
Let's leave it in the past.

What?

33:51.404 --> 33:53.615

you know, how we felt,

40:56.371 --> 40:58.790
how I want that again...

40:58.790 --> 41:00.625
with someone else.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.877
( sighs )

41:02.877 --> 41:04.712
That's why I broke

41:02.877 --> 41:04.712
up with Abbey.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.299
You did?

41:07.299 --> 41:09.550
Yeah.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.929
I just realized we weren't

41:09.550 --> 41:12.929
moving in that direction.

41:12.929 --> 41:17.267
NARRATOR:

41:12.929 --> 41:17.267
<i>Huh. And here I thought</i>

41:12.929 --> 41:17.267
<i>it was what Petra said.</i>

41:17.267 --> 41:20.103
<i>And unfortunately,</i>

41:17.267 --> 41:20.103
<i>so did Abbey.</i>

41:20.103 --> 41:22.647
What's this?

41:20.103 --> 41:22.647
Don't know. Came for you.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.817
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

41:28.278 --> 41:29.654
ABBEY:

41:28.278 --> 41:29.654
Hi there.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.261
( keyboard clacking )

41:59.309 --> 42:01.436
