our judges, shall we?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.404
Simon, welcome to your new home. Can
I just say...

05:48.405 --> 05:50.605
(CHEERING)

05:52.525 --> 05:54.764
I just want to thank Ashley.

05:54.765 --> 05:59.604
That was an unbelievable opening
from my favourite movie of all time.

05:59.605 --> 06:02.804
Yeah. Brilliant. Brilliant.
Absolutely fantastic.

06:02.805 --> 06:05.684
Let me just try and spell out how
the week's going to work.

06:05.685 --> 06:08.644
You were amazing as well. Thank
you. It was nothing, really.

06:08.645 --> 06:12.324
Let me explain. So, the public are
going to choose the top three acts

06:12.325 --> 06:14.924
every night this week,
then you judges will choose...

06:14.925 --> 06:16.644
The first act goes through,

06:16.645 --> 06:19.684
then you judges choose from
the next two acts. Correct.

06:19.685 --> 06:23.244
So you still have work to do. We've
got a bit of power back this year.

06:23.245 --> 06:26.364
Yes. We had nothing to do last year.
(LAUGHTER)

06:26.365 --> 06:28.644
David, our new home.

06:28.645 --> 06:31.244
The biggest venue we've ever had
for the live shows.

06:31.245 --> 06:33.764
We've got a big audience,
almost 3,000.

06:33.765 --> 06:37.604
They're very noisy, as you've heard
already. (CHEERING)

06:37.605 --> 06:39.644
(CHUCKLES)

06:39.645 --> 06:43.724
What-What does that mean... What
does that mean for our acts though?

06:43.725 --> 06:46.804
Are you further away,
or have you shrunk?

06:46.805 --> 06:49.724
(LAUGHTER) Because you look smaller
than usual there.

06:49.725 --> 06:51.564
I am definitely further away.

06:51.565 --> 06:55.844
You know, a lot more people in the
audience means a lot more pressure.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.565
And as you know, a lot more
pressure can be a good thing.

06:59.645 --> 07:01.364
Moving swiftly on. Alesha!

07:01.365 --> 07:05.044
Your Golden Buzzer act Lifford
Shillingford is here tonight.

07:05.045 --> 07:07.484
Are you confident he can win
a place in our final?

07:07.485 --> 07:10.204
I know he's so nervous. (CHEERING)

07:10.205 --> 07:13.684
All Lifford has to do is sing and
let his talent do the talking.

07:13.685 --> 07:16.964
He is unbelievable and tonight is
his night. Fingers crossed.

07:16.965 --> 07:20.044
Amanda - Yes, darling? ..looking at
the audition shows this year,

07:20.045 --> 07:22.324
it feels like the level of talent
has gone up.

07:22.325 --> 07:25.924
Every time I've gone to the shops
or supermarket or anything,

07:25.925 --> 07:28.604
everyone says this has been the
best year ever

07:28.605 --> 07:30.244
of Britain's Got Talent talent.

07:30.245 --> 07:33.364
That's 12 years. (CHEERING)

07:33.365 --> 07:35.044
Yeah.

07:35.045 --> 07:37.884
I... (WHISTLING)

07:37.885 --> 07:40.604
They don't know, not even the
producers know,

07:40.605 --> 07:44.484
I've got a surprise for the winner
at the end of this series. Amazing.

07:44.485 --> 07:48.004
Not even ITV know. We will look
forward to that.

07:48.005 --> 07:50.324
A big, big surprise. (WHISTLING)

07:50.325 --> 07:52.884
(CHUCKLES)
Nothing like building it up.

07:52.885 --> 07:55.524
It's worth winning,
that's all I can say. Fantastic.

07:55.525 --> 07:58.044
Thank you for the moment, judges.
Let's get going

07:58.045 --> 07:59.724
and kick off the live semi-finals

07:59.725 --> 08:03.245
with a Salsa group of
dancing kids... (CHEERING)

08:04.405 --> 08:07.444
..whose audition proved one thing.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.484
A little guy with a cheeky smile

08:09.485 --> 08:12.004
can go a long way
on Britain's Got Talent.

08:12.005 --> 08:15.004
I mean, let's be honest, some of us
have built a career on it.

08:15.005 --> 08:17.724
Kicking off the semi-finals,
it's Cali Swing.

08:17.725 --> 08:19.405
(CHEERING)

08:23.645 --> 08:26.045
We are... ALL: Cali Swing.

08:27.325 --> 08:29.964
We are a Colombian-style salsa
group.

08:29.965 --> 08:32.844
The best thing
about Cali Swing is that

08:32.845 --> 08:35.124
we all have fun dancing
with each other.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.404
When one person's silly,
everyone just behaves silly.

08:38.405 --> 08:40.005
(LAUGHTER)

08:41.164 --> 08:43.404
We rehearse at a bar called
Restaurant.

08:43.405 --> 08:45.884
It makes us feel good cos there's
people watching

08:45.885 --> 08:47.764
and it encourages us.

08:47.765 --> 08:50.884
The food there is so delicious.
I love it.

08:50.885 --> 08:54.004
After rehearsal, when I'm hungry,
I just go eat there.

08:54.005 --> 08:55.805
(LAUGHTER)

08:57.045 --> 08:59.164
Dancing on the stage at
Britain's Got Talent

08:59.165 --> 09:01.004
was an amazing experience.

09:01.005 --> 09:03.524
My favourite bit was when
I winked at Alesha.

09:03.525 --> 09:05.564
She's beautiful.

09:05.565 --> 09:07.404
(LAUGHTER)

09:07.405 --> 09:10.044
To be in the semi-finals of
Britain's Got Talent,

09:10.045 --> 09:12.245
it feels like a dream.
It is just amazing.

09:13.285 --> 09:16.404
We're all feeling really excited
because we've worked so hard.

09:16.405 --> 09:19.124
We want to give it our all,
make all our parents proud

09:19.125 --> 09:21.404

in the final.

11:43.312 --> 11:47.238
(CHEERING) Welcome back to the start
of semi-final week

11:47.240 --> 11:48.879
here on Britain's Got Talent.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.519
Now, the weather here in London has
caused a few technical difficulties

11:52.520 --> 11:55.959
which meant some of Part One's show
apparently didn't reach you at home.

11:55.857 --> 11:58.736
So the details of how to vote for
our first act Cali Swing

11:58.737 --> 12:02.336
are on your screen now - (CHEERING)
..but don't vote yet.

12:02.337 --> 12:05.136

All going well so far, guys (!)
(GIGGLES)

12:08.817 --> 12:12.896
Dec? Dec! I'm just gonna say:
Ant, you are coming back next year.

12:12.897 --> 12:15.136
You don't have to do that.
(LAUGHTER)

12:15.137 --> 12:19.576
(CHEERING) Next... Next up tonight
is Alesha's Golden Buzzer act.

12:19.577 --> 12:22.416
Now, his audition was bursting with
soul.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.456
Tonight, he's ready to give
everything

12:24.457 --> 12:26.096
for a place in our final.

12:26.097 --> 12:28.136
It's Lifford Shillingford.

12:28.137 --> 12:30.176
(CHEERING)

12:30.177 --> 12:33.216
My name's Lifford.
I'm 42 and I'm from South London.

12:33.217 --> 12:36.536
I've been with my wife
since I was 14.

12:36.537 --> 12:39.256
I knew straightaway
that she was the one.

12:39.257 --> 12:42.656
When I was 20, I was in
a group called Public Demand.

12:42.657 --> 12:45.976
We ended up touring with Gabrielle
and East 17.

12:45.977 --> 12:49.776
We released a couple singles, but
they didn't do great,

12:49.777 --> 12:52.136
so we ended up getting dropped from
the label.

12:52.137 --> 12:55.456
At that time, I had two young
daughters to consider,

12:55.457 --> 12:57.696
so I ended up working in a sports
shop.

12:57.697 --> 12:59.736
It was a shock to the system.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.776
Then my manager told me about an
audition for Artful Dodger.

13:03.777 --> 13:06.056
# Please don't turn me on #

13:06.057 --> 13:10.097
It was crazy for about two years,
but that too in the end fizzled out.

13:11.417 --> 13:15.576
I lost hope. I started to get
really depressed and anxious.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.536
There were a lot of times when
I was just locked in the bedroom

13:18.537 --> 13:20.257
and I'd spend days up there.

13:21.337 --> 13:23.776
The only thing that kept me
going was my wife.

13:23.777 --> 13:25.976
She is the reason why I am still
here.

13:25.977 --> 13:28.776
To get the Golden Buzzer felt
unreal.

13:28.777 --> 13:31.776
It was what I needed to gain
confidence again.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.816
Singing completes me.

13:33.817 --> 13:36.776
I want to get into the final so
badly.

16:04.537 --> 16:06.656
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

16:06.657 --> 16:09.176
Let's just move that out the way
for you, Lifford.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.056
Alesha, your Golden Buzzer.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.776
Oh, Lifford, I'm so happy for you.

16:12.777 --> 16:15.376
I really am. It takes courage and
guts to get up there.

16:15.377 --> 16:17.256
I know how you feel as an artist.

16:17.257 --> 16:20.416
If you're not doing that,
you're not yourself and I get that.

16:20.417 --> 16:23.256
I think, a lot of people watching,
it will really resonate,

16:23.257 --> 16:25.536
somebody that doesn't give up on
their dreams.

16:25.537 --> 16:28.656
I really hope this is the start of
something brilliant for you.

16:28.657 --> 16:31.616
Well done. (CHEERING)

16:31.617 --> 16:33.856
Woo!

16:33.857 --> 16:36.296
(CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH)

16:36.297 --> 16:39.896
Oh, it was brilliant.
It was really good.

16:39.897 --> 16:42.536
For me, it felt much more of a sort
of confident,

16:42.537 --> 16:45.176
laid-back, really beautiful
audition.

16:45.177 --> 16:46.936
The microphone loves your voice.

16:46.937 --> 16:50.296
It was beautiful and this is a
cliche.

16:50.297 --> 16:52.576
You were talking about believing in
yesterday.

16:52.577 --> 16:55.696
You have a future, so believe in
tomorrow. Thank you.

16:55.697 --> 16:57.697
(CHEERING)

17:01.017 --> 17:06.016
Er, Lifford, tell me again how old
you are. I'm... I was 43 last week.

17:06.017 --> 17:08.856
43. OK. Well, that doesn't matter.
(CHEERING)

17:08.857 --> 17:11.576
I think the good thing for you
right now

17:11.577 --> 17:17.455
is that I think musicals, being on
Broadway, being in the West End,

17:17.457 --> 17:20.415
where I used to use that as a
derogatory term...

17:20.416 --> 17:24.695
I think that's the highest condiment
I could pay someone like you now,

17:24.696 --> 17:26.935
which is where
I think you should be.

17:26.936 --> 17:29.976
I thought the song choice was
terrible, if you want my opinion.

17:29.977 --> 17:32.016
(BOOING) I did.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.496
I didn't like the arrangement.

17:34.497 --> 17:37.336
I actually didn't like anything
about your performance.

17:37.337 --> 17:41.736
It didn't feel that this was, after
all these years, that it was...

17:41.737 --> 17:43.776
(BOOING)

17:43.777 --> 17:45.616
..that it was building up to this.

17:45.617 --> 17:49.936
You know, it was very lazy and very
laid-back, very kind of wine bar-ish.

17:49.937 --> 17:53.256
(BOOING) And I think that you're
so much better than that.

17:53.257 --> 17:57.416
I think you have such a great voice.

17:57.417 --> 18:00.456
I wish you could have sung something
better.

18:00.457 --> 18:03.296
But who knows? I think the audience
do agree with me as well.

18:03.297 --> 18:05.736
OK. (BOOING)

18:05.737 --> 18:10.456
Simon Cowell, you are talking
out of your arse again.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.096
(CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH)
It was utter nonsense.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.816
It was beautiful, it was soulful.

18:15.817 --> 18:18.616
We always say in this show,
two minutes to change your life.

18:18.617 --> 18:20.976
That was astonishing. Well done.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.176
(CHEERING)

18:23.177 --> 18:25.496
Well done. Slightly mixed.

18:25.497 --> 18:27.536
Slightly mixed, but don't worry.

18:27.537 --> 18:30.296
Don't worry because the details of
how to vote for Lifford

18:30.297 --> 18:31.936
are on your screen now.

18:31.937 --> 18:34.216
The vote doesn't open until the
end of the show.

18:34.217 --> 18:37.616
One more time, let's hear it for
Lifford Shillingford, everybody!

dynamic dancer Shameer Rayes

18:52.417 --> 18:54.456

19:03.720 --> 19:07.759
Welcome back to
the start of live semi-final week

19:07.760 --> 19:10.319
here on Britain's Got Talent now -

19:10.320 --> 19:13.180
Next - You're looking... Sorry,
you're looking a tiny bit tense.

19:13.182 --> 19:15.981
I'm not tense. No, let me just try
and get rid of that

19:15.982 --> 19:18.301
while you do the link, OK?
(LAUGHTER)

19:18.302 --> 19:20.661
(CHEERING) OK. Next up - Is it the
lower back?

19:20.662 --> 19:22.941
No, it's fine.
No, don't do it there.

19:22.942 --> 19:25.541
Next up tonight is
a freestyle dancer

19:25.542 --> 19:28.781
whose audition went...
That is surprisingly good.

19:28.782 --> 19:31.821
I think we need to take this off.
No, we don't need to take this off.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.061
Next up, a freestyler who says that
tonight,

19:34.062 --> 19:38.341
he's determined to make
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-anchester proud.

19:38.342 --> 19:40.701
It's Shameer Rayes.
(CHEERING)

19:40.702 --> 19:42.741
Very nice.

19:42.742 --> 19:44.542
(CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH)

19:47.231 --> 19:51.670
I'm Shameer. I'm 19 and I'm from
Manchester and I'm a dancer.

19:51.671 --> 19:55.910
I'm studying psychology and
criminology at Salford University.

19:55.911 --> 19:59.423
An average day at uni is quite
tedious,

19:59.424 --> 20:01.463
cos I can't concentrate sometimes.

20:01.464 --> 20:05.623
I enjoy it, but it is really
difficult and that all builds up.

20:05.624 --> 20:07.743
It's so good to have dance.

20:07.744 --> 20:09.583
# BRUNO MARS FEAT. CARDI B: Finesse

20:09.584 --> 20:12.423
I just put in my earphones and
listen to my favourite music

20:12.424 --> 20:15.103
and I just dance and just relieve
all of that stress.

20:15.104 --> 20:17.823
People look at me weird, but I look
at them weird,

20:17.824 --> 20:20.103
like why aren't you dancing too?

20:20.104 --> 20:22.704
Then I realise they can't hear my
music, so...

20:25.184 --> 20:28.063
My brother Shaquille got four yeses
at his first audition,

20:28.064 --> 20:31.383
but unfortunately he didn't make
it through to the semi-final.

20:31.384 --> 20:35.623
It's a no. I definitely wouldn't
have done well at all

20:35.624 --> 20:38.343
if my brother wasn't there to
support me.

20:38.344 --> 20:40.583
I'm going to try and do this for
him.

20:40.584 --> 20:43.063
This is the biggest moment of my
life.

20:43.064 --> 20:46.583
I want to make it something that
I can look back on and be proud of.

20:46.584 --> 20:50.064
If you mess up, you fall offstage
and you'll be a meme forever.

20:52.304 --> 20:53.904
(CHEERING)

20:56.264 --> 20:58.903
Sorry. Sorry.

All right?

23:00.104 --> 23:01.744
Amanda.

23:04.024 --> 23:09.223
I absolutely loved how you've gone
from, like, an antique doll

23:09.224 --> 23:11.943
to a futuristic robot.

23:11.944 --> 23:13.783
But I mean, I loved the music.

23:13.784 --> 23:16.583
I loved the technology
and the whole presentation of that.

23:16.584 --> 23:20.223
If I'm honest, I found the
choreography a bit under-par.

23:20.224 --> 23:24.783
I preferred your actual audition,
but I love... You're infectious.

23:24.784 --> 23:26.623
(BOOING)

23:26.624 --> 23:29.543
As a personality,
you have so much energy

23:29.544 --> 23:31.223
and so much positivity.

23:31.224 --> 23:34.463
That smile is a winning smile,
so I wish you all the best.

23:34.464 --> 23:36.144
(CHEERING)

23:38.264 --> 23:40.583
What do you remember about his
audition?

23:40.584 --> 23:43.663
He was on a thing and it was just
that little bit more... What?

23:43.664 --> 23:46.103
He was on the... I don't know what
you call it.

23:46.104 --> 23:48.743
When you're doing it,
it was a bit slower.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.423
I asked that because, for me,

23:50.424 --> 23:53.143
this was 100 times better than your
first audition. Good.

23:53.144 --> 23:56.623
(CHEERING) It was. I thought
everything about it was great.

23:56.624 --> 23:59.463
The production was great. I mean,
look, you're a solo artist.

23:59.464 --> 24:01.743
It is very difficult to come on a
stage like this.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.303
I think you made...
The entrance was great.

24:04.304 --> 24:06.983
What you did with the lasers was
great.

24:06.984 --> 24:10.943
Your personality was fantastic.
I really think you made an effort.

24:10.944 --> 24:14.303
I'm happy you made the finals. You
may have a shot here. Good for you.

24:14.304 --> 24:16.304
(CHEERING)

24:18.384 --> 24:22.623
With the music and lights, I was
having a kind of flashback to Ibiza.

24:22.624 --> 24:25.543
But it was... it was fantastic.

24:25.544 --> 24:27.383
It is one of the hardest things to
do,

24:27.384 --> 24:29.583
if you're a solo dancer,
to fill the stage.

24:29.584 --> 24:33.503
And you really did. It was a
mesmerising performance.

24:33.504 --> 24:35.343
(CHEERING) I agree.

24:35.344 --> 24:37.943
Honestly, I know what Amanda is
saying.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.703
You must be a fan of Little Buck,
right? Amazing dancer.

24:40.704 --> 24:43.103
Oh, Little Buck, yeah.
Yeah. Amazing dancer.

24:43.104 --> 24:45.903
He has brought that style of
dancing to the mainstream.

24:45.904 --> 24:48.583
You could do that. Sorry,
I didn't catch - Little Buck.

24:48.584 --> 24:51.503
Little Buck. Yeah. You must be...
Check him out. Thank you.

24:51.504 --> 24:54.623
If you can do that, what you did in
the audition -

24:54.624 --> 24:56.703
I look up to him a lot. He's
amazing.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.543
That is what you remind me of.

24:58.544 --> 25:01.903
So, listen... (CHEERING) ..this
style isn't seen very often.

25:01.904 --> 25:03.583
Can I say something?

25:03.584 --> 25:06.503
You, erm, you remind me of Little
Buck.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.543
(LAUGHTER) I think we've done that.

25:08.544 --> 25:11.303
You remind me of Little Buck as
well. I think we've done that.

25:11.304 --> 25:14.543
And you wanted to dedicate that
performance to your brother?

25:14.544 --> 25:18.063
To my brother. It's his birthday
and he's over there. (CHEERING)

25:18.064 --> 25:20.463
Happy birthday, Shaquille.

25:20.464 --> 25:24.543
So, if I get into the final,
it's for you. Ah! Lovely.

25:24.544 --> 25:28.063
To vote for Shameer, just follow
the instructions onscreen,

25:28.064 --> 25:29.703
but not until the end of the show.

25:29.704 --> 25:31.743
One more time: Shameer Rayes!

25:31.744 --> 25:33.744
(CHEERING)

25:40.744 --> 25:43.383
Now our next act is a magician

25:43.384 --> 25:46.423
who left Amanda Holden
completely speechless.

25:46.424 --> 25:49.703
Amanda's husband has already asked
if he's free at weekends.

25:49.704 --> 25:51.743
It's Maddox Dixon.

25:51.744 --> 25:54.184
My name is Maddox and I'm a
magician.

25:55.224 --> 25:58.823
Before magic, I was a musician,
playing piano and guitar

25:58.824 --> 26:00.463
for lots of different people.

26:00.464 --> 26:02.143
But, after a while,

26:02.144 --> 26:04.823
I started to feel like I wanted
to be doing my own thing

26:04.824 --> 26:08.384
and magic was always something
I've been so excited to do.

26:09.424 --> 26:11.943
The first audition just
went much better

26:11.944 --> 26:13.783
than I possibly could have dreamed.

26:13.784 --> 26:15.903
Open your eyes.

26:15.904 --> 26:17.543
(CHEERING)

26:17.544 --> 26:19.463
What?

26:19.464 --> 26:21.623
Shut up, man!

26:21.624 --> 26:24.503
When Amanda pulled the cube out and
she'd solved it,

26:24.504 --> 26:26.543
I was as surprised
as everyone else.

26:26.544 --> 26:30.583
I believe in magic. Giving up music
was a really scary thing to do,

26:30.584 --> 26:33.303
but being on that stage,
for the first time in my life,

26:33.304 --> 26:36.783
I felt like I'd been in the right
place doing the thing that I love.

26:36.784 --> 26:39.663
(LAUGHTER) I like to put magic
in the hands of

26:39.664 --> 26:42.383
the people that I'm performing to.
How did you do that?

26:42.384 --> 26:44.623
There's magic in everyday life.

26:44.624 --> 26:48.903
It's just about taking those small
things and making them seem bigger.

26:48.904 --> 26:50.943
No way! (LAUGHTER)

26:50.944 --> 26:53.583
To get into the final,
it would mean the world.

26:53.584 --> 26:55.903
I can't wait to go out on
that stage tonight.

26:55.904 --> 26:57.943
The magic's gonna be in the judges'
hands.

26:57.944 --> 27:02.103
A few things can go wrong, but I'm
hoping that everything goes to plan.

27:02.104 --> 27:04.104
(CHEERING)

27:08.904 --> 27:10.943
It's great to be back.

27:10.944 --> 27:12.624
As a magician...

27:13.944 --> 27:15.703
Ooh!

27:15.704 --> 27:19.824
..you would expect me to be able to
make objects...

27:21.904 --> 27:24.383
..materialise. Oh, wow!

27:24.384 --> 27:26.463
And using sleight of hand,

27:26.464 --> 27:28.464
maybe show you something that
looks...

27:30.344 --> 27:32.103
..impossible.

27:32.104 --> 27:34.343
Tonight it's actually going to be
our judges

27:34.344 --> 27:36.863
who are gonna create the impossible
for themselves

27:36.864 --> 27:39.143
using only their imagination
to make it real.

27:39.144 --> 27:40.783
Simon, I've got a gift for you,

27:40.784 --> 27:43.183
but you're not allowed to have this
until the end.

27:42.918 --> 27:46.157
Judges, what I'd like you to do is
imagine burning a deck of cards,

27:46.158 --> 27:48.877
using a fire that
only exists in your mind.

27:48.878 --> 27:51.677
At the end, one of you's going to
imagine reaching in

27:51.678 --> 27:53.717
and saving just one card.

27:53.718 --> 27:56.037
But, first, three decisions
need to be made.

27:56.038 --> 27:58.877
David - Yes? ..there are number
cards and picture cards.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.277
Now, whatever you say, that's what
we'll burn.

28:01.278 --> 28:03.957
So do you want to burn the numbers
or burn the pictures?

28:03.958 --> 28:05.997
I'll burn the pictures. Pictures.

28:05.998 --> 28:09.397
Alesha,
that's the Jacks, Queens and Kings.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.557
To save time, do you want burn
the male picture cards, the men,

28:12.558 --> 28:15.877
or the female picture cards, the
women? What do you think?

28:15.878 --> 28:18.917
It's your choice. Burn the men. The
men.

28:18.918 --> 28:22.117
(GIGGLES) No more Jacks, no more
Kings.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.597
Amanda,
that leaves just four cards.

28:24.598 --> 28:27.797
The Queen of Hearts, Spades, Clubs,
and the Queen of Diamonds.

28:27.798 --> 28:29.437
I light them all on fire.

28:29.438 --> 28:32.997
I want you to imagine reaching in
and saving just one.

28:32.998 --> 28:36.037
Which Queen do you choose to save?

28:36.038 --> 28:38.077
The Queen of Hearts.

28:38.078 --> 28:41.997
The Queen of Hearts. She's saved.

28:41.998 --> 28:45.237
And you would think that all of
this was just in your imagination

28:45.238 --> 28:48.717
but, together, tonight,
you've just made it a reality.

28:48.718 --> 28:51.237
Simon, please,
could you open that gift?

28:51.238 --> 28:53.878
Hold up whatever's inside
and show everyone.

28:57.398 --> 28:59.398
Smoke.

29:03.678 --> 29:06.157
One single burnt card.

29:06.158 --> 29:07.837
One card out of 52.

29:07.838 --> 29:10.117
The only card you were just
imagining.

29:10.118 --> 29:13.677
If you can trust in your
imagination, anything is possible,

29:13.678 --> 29:17.278
which is why tonight, I wanted to
try something a little bit bigger.

29:18.318 --> 29:20.597
Dec, thank you, sir, for helping.
Pleasure.

29:20.598 --> 29:23.917
Sam, right? They've both been told
briefly what I want them to do.

29:23.918 --> 29:26.797
They're gonna lie back and put
their hands above their head.

29:26.798 --> 29:31.117
Guys, if you can just hold onto
this wooden board for me...

29:31.118 --> 29:33.957
Perfect. I'm going to invite
a friend of mine out here.

29:33.958 --> 29:36.397
We're actually going to lay her on
that board.

29:36.398 --> 29:39.757
Sam, Dec, I know this is gonna feel
difficult to begin with,

29:39.758 --> 29:42.877
but keep your arms locked and you
will be able to hold her up.

29:42.878 --> 29:45.117
Perfect. Keep supporting it

29:45.118 --> 29:47.557
because now we're gonna remove the
board.

29:47.558 --> 29:49.957
Dec, just let go of that board.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.197
Regrip.

29:52.198 --> 29:54.637
Have you got her? Yeah. OK.

29:54.638 --> 29:56.638
(CHEERING)

29:58.198 --> 30:01.477
I'd like you to get used to the way
that that feels,

30:01.478 --> 30:04.918
cos we're about to take this even
further.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.957
Often, life can look a little bit
like this,

30:08.958 --> 30:11.797
we're all trying to hold someone or
something up.

30:11.798 --> 30:13.477
And it can be easy to doubt

30:13.478 --> 30:16.317
whether we'll ever be strong enough
to keep going.

30:16.318 --> 30:19.317
But every time you tell yourself
you can achieve something

30:19.318 --> 30:22.318
and learn to let go...

30:23.558 --> 30:25.597
(CHEERING)

30:25.598 --> 30:28.838
..you realise you never needed
anyone else's help.

30:29.918 --> 30:33.798
You just had to be able to imagine
that nothing...

30:36.078 --> 30:37.797
..is impossible.

30:37.798 --> 30:39.798
(CHEERING)

30:46.158 --> 30:47.997
Dec, Sam, put your hands up.

30:47.998 --> 30:49.598
Take her weight again.

30:53.398 --> 30:55.398
OK. (CHEERING)

31:00.358 --> 31:03.597
Of course, for me,
this is where my journey began,

31:03.598 --> 31:05.797
on the stage with a puzzle,

31:05.798 --> 31:08.237
knowing there were a million
possibilities.

31:08.238 --> 31:12.317
Sometimes I still can't believe I'm
here, but it's true.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.957
If you can believe anything is
possible,

31:14.958 --> 31:18.557
your life really can change

31:18.558 --> 31:21.878
in one single moment.

31:23.198 --> 31:25.437
I'm Maddox Dixon. Good night.

31:25.438 --> 31:27.477
(CHEERING)

31:27.478 --> 31:29.478
(WHISTLING)

31:36.638 --> 31:38.638
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

31:40.478 --> 31:42.517
Wow! Amazing.

31:42.518 --> 31:44.557
(WHISTLING)

31:44.558 --> 31:46.277
Simon?

31:46.278 --> 31:49.877
You know what? I'm just going to be
honest with you for a moment.

31:49.878 --> 31:53.077
This, I don't really care about.

31:53.078 --> 31:56.157
The Rubik's cube,
I've seen a million times.

31:56.158 --> 32:00.557
There was a girl balancing on one
person's finger

32:00.558 --> 32:02.197
in the middle of the act.

32:02.198 --> 32:04.037
That should have been the end.

32:04.038 --> 32:06.397
Seriously.
You know what I'm saying?

32:06.398 --> 32:08.957
It was like you kind of threw that
part away.

32:08.958 --> 32:11.157
Erm, but because...

32:11.158 --> 32:13.477
Look, I like the way magic is going
at the moment.

32:13.478 --> 32:16.717
I like the way all you guys are
talking and it's very seamless

32:16.718 --> 32:20.237
and you've got the music,
but there has to be an ending.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.557
I think if you're capable of doing
things like you just did...

32:23.558 --> 32:26.077
Look, Dec, that was real, right?

32:26.078 --> 32:29.117
I was in the middle of it and I've
got no idea what was happening.

32:29.118 --> 32:30.797
Exactly. It was unbelievable.

32:30.798 --> 32:32.877
I just wish we could've ended on
that.

32:32.878 --> 32:34.917
Thank you. (CHEERING)

32:34.918 --> 32:36.638
You're amazing.

32:39.518 --> 32:41.557
Did you enjoy the view?

32:41.558 --> 32:44.637
(LAUGHTER) I wasn't looking, David.

32:44.638 --> 32:47.957
Er, yeah, it was...
I feel a bit shell-shocked

32:47.958 --> 32:51.037
because I'm so befuddled
by how you did that.

32:51.038 --> 32:53.997
I feel like
I'm a sort of prehistoric man

32:53.998 --> 32:56.797
who's just seen fire for the first
time, or something.

32:56.798 --> 32:59.317
I don't understand what I've just
seen. It was great.

32:59.318 --> 33:01.197
You did end on the lady floating,

33:01.198 --> 33:03.517
you just did a bit with the Rubik's
cube at the end.

33:03.518 --> 33:07.277
It was fantastic. He loves his
Rubik's Cube. Well, who wouldn't?

33:07.278 --> 33:08.917
(CHEERING)

33:08.918 --> 33:12.477
Yeah, Maddox, I just love the
presentation, everything about you.

33:12.478 --> 33:14.317
You are making magic really cool.

33:14.318 --> 33:17.157
You're in with a great chance
tonight. That was brilliant.

33:17.158 --> 33:19.997
Thank you. (CHEERING)

33:19.998 --> 33:24.157
Yeah, I mean, I just feel very
comfortable watching you.

33:24.158 --> 33:25.997
You know,
your hands aren't shaking,

33:25.998 --> 33:28.317
you're very slick, you're very
presentable.

33:28.318 --> 33:30.637
You're very pretty. It helps.

33:30.638 --> 33:33.357
I think the whole thing was really
well put together.

33:33.358 --> 33:36.997
I agree with Simon, the floating
lady at the end was the best bit.

33:36.998 --> 33:39.037
Well done. It was brilliant.
Thank you.

33:39.038 --> 33:41.077
(CHEERING) Thank you very much,
judges.

33:41.078 --> 33:43.557
Maddox, it's amazing, whichever way
you look at it.

33:43.558 --> 33:45.637
If you think Maddox is tonight's
winner,

33:45.638 --> 33:48.797
the details of how to vote
for him are on your screen now.

33:48.798 --> 33:51.957
Remember, voting doesn't open
until the last act has performed.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.997
One more time, let's hear it for
Maddox Dixon, everybody!

33:54.998 --> 33:56.998
(CHEERING)

34:03.118 --> 34:05.837
Time for another quick break.
When we come back,

34:05.838 --> 34:09.277
we've got quick-change craziness
from Ellie and Jeki

34:09.277 --> 34:11.597
plus comedy from Lost Voice Guy.

34:11.598 --> 34:14.958
See you for that in a few minutes.
(CHEERING)

34:20.706 --> 34:24.585
Welcome back to the first live
semi-final of Britain's Got Talent.

34:24.585 --> 34:28.665
Next up tonight are Ellie and Jeki,
a married couple quick-change act.

34:28.666 --> 34:31.304
Jeki says he loves his wife so much.

34:31.306 --> 34:33.425
On stage,
she's a brilliant performer,

34:33.426 --> 34:35.905
and at home, she can get ready
to go out in 30 seconds flat.

34:35.906 --> 34:38.786
It's Ellie and Jeki.

34:41.065 --> 34:43.665
I am Jeki.
I am Ellie.

34:43.666 --> 34:47.264
We are from South Korea. We are
magicians and quick-change artists.

34:47.266 --> 34:50.185
We were so nervous in
the last audition.

34:50.186 --> 34:53.105
But the applause and support
of the audience were a huge help.

34:53.106 --> 34:56.386
It is a brilliant, slick,
fabulous act. Well done.

34:59.426 --> 35:04.585
Ellie is everything to me. Ellie is
clever and cute and so beautiful.

35:04.586 --> 35:07.625
Yeah, so I fell in love with her.
Yeah.

35:07.626 --> 35:13.146
Jeki is a very hard-working person.
Four years ago we got married.

35:18.186 --> 35:21.465
My dream was
to be a fashion designer.

35:21.466 --> 35:24.185
I design all of the outfits
in our show.

35:24.186 --> 35:28.825
It gives me a great joy to see all
of my designs come alive on stage.

35:28.826 --> 35:32.505
We practice every day
five or six hours

35:32.506 --> 35:34.825
to make sure our act is perfect.

35:34.826 --> 35:38.745
We are so excited
to be in the semi-finals.

35:38.746 --> 35:41.746
We can't wait to show our
performance tonight.

35:43.546 --> 35:46.985
The best thing that ever happened
to me was marrying my partner Ellie.

35:46.986 --> 35:51.746
But winning Britain's Got Talent
would be a dream come true.

35:53.866 --> 35:55.625

37:52.746 --> 37:55.905
A buzz in the semi-final, Simon?

37:55.906 --> 37:58.305
Well, it's supposed
to be quick change.

37:58.306 --> 38:00.426
It was very slow change.

38:02.546 --> 38:04.665
(JEERING)

38:04.666 --> 38:07.865
I am sorry.
It partly wasn't your fault.

38:07.866 --> 38:11.705
Whoever put that shambles together,
it did not work.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.945
It was really bad.
I mean, really bad.

38:13.946 --> 38:17.105
(BOOING)

38:17.106 --> 38:21.025
I mean, one of the worst.
Well, I rather enjoyed it.

38:21.026 --> 38:22.585
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:22.586 --> 38:24.465
And I thought it was lovely.

38:24.466 --> 38:27.985
It was a very romantic celebration
of your story

38:27.986 --> 38:30.505
and your love
with a very happy ending.

38:30.506 --> 38:34.745
And you know what? It was romantic,
Simon, two people getting married.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.665
This would be an ideal moment
to propose to Lauren.

38:37.666 --> 38:40.066
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:57.186 --> 39:00.105
Look, guys, it was a bit corny.

39:00.106 --> 39:03.785
It didn't wow me as much
as it did the first time we saw you.

39:03.786 --> 39:05.945
But you are so cute and so adorable,

39:05.946 --> 39:08.425
and I'm all for love,
so well done tonight.

39:08.426 --> 39:10.026
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:11.466 --> 39:14.545
Yeah. I am all for love as well.

39:14.546 --> 39:16.825
But I have to agree with Simon.

39:16.826 --> 39:20.785
It didn't feel as slick and as
exciting as your first audition.

39:20.786 --> 39:23.545
There were also millions more
costume changes.

39:23.546 --> 39:26.545
There were only about four or five.
It felt like that, anyway.

39:26.546 --> 39:28.905
But I know it takes a
lot of hard work,

39:28.906 --> 39:33.505
and I wish you all the best
cos it's horrible when you have
to say negative things.

39:33.506 --> 39:35.745
Well, you enjoy it.

39:35.746 --> 39:37.665
Well, you know. Yay.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.185
(LAUGHTER)

39:39.186 --> 39:41.745
Mostly positive from the panel.

39:41.746 --> 39:44.625
How do you feel
about Simon's comments in particular?

39:44.626 --> 39:47.385
Yeah. Makes me nervous.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.385
Me, too.
Yeah, but...

39:49.386 --> 39:56.105
I think we will do best if we go
through next - I like your style.

39:56.106 --> 39:57.905
Yes.
Good work.

39:57.906 --> 40:01.385
To see Ellie and Jeki back here
for the big final on Sunday,

40:01.386 --> 40:03.705
follow the instructions on screen.

40:03.706 --> 40:06.985
But not yet. Voting doesn't open
till the end of the show.

40:06.986 --> 40:10.146
One more time for Ellie and Jeki,
everybody! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:17.506 --> 40:20.865
Now, our next act is a comedian
who can't use his voice,

40:20.866 --> 40:25.505
so he speaks through a speech app
on his tablet.

40:25.506 --> 40:29.825
He's all ready to go backstage,
but he was a bit nervous earlier,

40:29.826 --> 40:32.665
so I wonder what's going
through his head right now.

40:32.666 --> 40:35.545
Get on with it, shorty.

40:35.546 --> 40:37.666
I'm running out of battery.

40:38.906 --> 40:42.225
Well, that's cleared that up.
It's the Lost Voice Guy.

40:42.226 --> 40:44.305
Tell me all about yourself, Lee.

40:44.306 --> 40:46.306
# BACH: Cello Suite No.1 Prelude

40:49.506 --> 40:52.665
Every day, I get asked
a lot of questions.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.105
Where you off to, mate?
Would you like any bags?

40:55.106 --> 40:56.786
What can I get you?

40:57.986 --> 41:02.745
'My cerebral palsy means I take
a bit longer to answer them,

41:02.746 --> 41:06.186
but my replies
are always worth the wait.

41:08.546 --> 41:14.705
I was first diagnosed with cerebral
palsy when I was six months old.

41:14.706 --> 41:18.145
I have no speech,
I walk like a zombie,

41:18.146 --> 41:22.905
and the right side of my body
is weaker than my left.

41:22.906 --> 41:28.985
It affects my daily life, but
I manage pretty well by myself.

41:28.986 --> 41:32.865
I am under pressure tonight because
my family are watching

41:32.866 --> 41:35.905
and I have already told them
that I am really funny.

41:35.906 --> 41:38.585
They have always been really
supportive.

41:38.586 --> 41:41.865
I doubt I could have done
as much as I have without them.

41:41.866 --> 41:45.265
It would mean the world
to me to get into the final.

41:45.266 --> 41:51.225
If tonight goes wrong, I am going
to blame it on Steve Jobs.

41:51.226 --> 41:56.025
Which reminds me, does anyone have
a charger that I can borrow?'

41:56.026 --> 41:57.585
(LAUGHTER)

41:57.586 --> 41:59.586
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

42:01.826 --> 42:06.505
'Hello, it's great to be back
on Britain's Got Talent.

42:06.506 --> 42:09.985
If you missed it,
my audition is on YouTube.

42:09.986 --> 42:14.025
I think the person who uploaded it,
is taking the mick, though,

42:14.026 --> 42:16.986
because the comments are disabled.'

42:18.306 --> 42:20.586
(LAUGHTER)

42:22.906 --> 42:26.425
'Sorry if I seem a bit nervous
tonight,

42:26.426 --> 42:30.065
but being in the semi-final
has made me very emotional.

42:30.066 --> 42:33.705
You can probably tell by my voice.'

42:33.706 --> 42:35.785
(LAUGHTER)

42:35.786 --> 42:38.505
'It's such an honour
to be performing here.

42:38.506 --> 42:42.745
I hope my parents
can be proud of me now

42:42.746 --> 42:45.105
because it's been 37 years,

42:45.106 --> 42:48.145
and they are still waiting
to hear if my first word

42:48.146 --> 42:50.745
is going to be "Mummy" or "Daddy".'

42:50.746 --> 42:53.305
(LAUGHTER)

42:53.306 --> 42:57.905
'In case you are still in any doubt,
I really am disabled.

42:57.906 --> 43:01.825
It's definitely not
just really good acting.

43:01.826 --> 43:05.146
And I'm not just in it
for the parking space.

43:06.786 --> 43:11.145
I lost my voice when I was very
young and I haven't found it since.

43:11.146 --> 43:15.065
I've looked everywhere for it,
down the back of the chair,

43:15.066 --> 43:17.505
in the washing machine, everywhere.

43:17.506 --> 43:21.905
On the bright side, I did find
the television remote control,

43:21.906 --> 43:26.905
so I can still mute Britain's Got
Talent whenever Simon speaks.'

43:26.906 --> 43:28.625
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:28.626 --> 43:30.745
Thank you.

43:30.746 --> 43:32.346
I like you.

43:33.986 --> 43:37.905
'It's been really crazy
since my first audition.

43:37.906 --> 43:42.185
Yesterday I was invited onto a radio
show to do an interview,

43:42.186 --> 43:44.665
but I couldn't be bothered going.

43:44.666 --> 43:49.666
So I just sent my computer
and a note saying, "Press play."'

43:51.666 --> 43:53.945
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

43:53.946 --> 43:58.625
'You get asked some really strange
questions when you are disabled.

43:58.626 --> 44:03.186
So, let's deal with the questions
I get asked every day.

44:06.746 --> 44:10.346
# Hey, what's wrong with you? #

44:12.866 --> 44:16.585
That's a bit of a personal question,
Phats And Small.

44:16.586 --> 44:20.705
But since you asked, I have a
disability called cerebral palsy.

44:20.706 --> 44:24.505
Don't worry,
you can't catch it from me.

44:24.506 --> 44:28.545
It just means you better not get
stuck behind me on the stairs

44:28.546 --> 44:30.346
if there's a fire.

an impression I've been working on.

(IMITATION OF THE QUEEN)
Hello, this is your Queen.

45:05.266 --> 45:08.905
One orders you to vote
for Lost Voice Guy.

45:08.906 --> 45:11.346

Even if you haven't, I can't really
change what I say at this point.

Goodbye.'

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

45:46.346 --> 45:47.906
All right? Happy?

45:50.106 --> 45:52.665
Amazing. Alesha.

45:52.666 --> 45:55.745
We love you so much.

45:55.746 --> 45:57.945
You can feel the energy in the room.

45:57.946 --> 46:01.545
You're so funny, so witty, unique.

46:01.546 --> 46:04.465
I think you will be perfect
for the Royal Variety.

46:04.466 --> 46:06.705
You need to be in the final.

46:06.706 --> 46:09.226
You're amazing.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

46:11.186 --> 46:14.545
I have said it before, but for me,
it is really important

46:14.546 --> 46:16.385
that comedy pushes boundaries

46:16.386 --> 46:18.745
and stuff gets said
that people don't dare say.

46:18.746 --> 46:20.545
I think we are living in a world now

46:20.546 --> 46:23.585
that is becoming very sterile
and very politically correct.

46:23.586 --> 46:25.265
You're breaking all those barriers.

46:25.266 --> 46:27.505
You're bloody hilarious.

46:27.506 --> 46:29.386
I really want you to win.

46:35.826 --> 46:38.745
I was liking it
until the midway point.

46:38.746 --> 46:40.625
When you have got it,
you have got it.

46:40.626 --> 46:44.785
That's why we have an audience here.
Like Amanda and Alesha said,

46:44.786 --> 46:46.705
you can feel the energy in the room.

46:46.706 --> 46:48.985
They just love you.
I feel the same way.

46:48.986 --> 46:51.065
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

46:51.066 --> 46:53.266
You're so bright, you're so naughty.

46:54.746 --> 46:57.665
And, genuinely...

46:57.666 --> 46:59.585
I know I say this all of the time,

46:59.586 --> 47:01.625
but I genuinely do believe with you,

47:01.626 --> 47:05.785
this is going to make a difference,
I really do. For the show,

47:05.786 --> 47:08.745
for you. I am really happy for you.
Great.

47:08.746 --> 47:09.985
Great.

47:09.986 --> 47:13.305
Everyone loves you.
And the reason they love you

47:13.306 --> 47:15.625
is you are utterly hilarious.

47:15.626 --> 47:17.705
All of those jokes are fantastic.

47:17.706 --> 47:21.385
Your comic timing, even knowing when
to press the button, is brilliant.

47:21.386 --> 47:25.665
I was thinking, "You have really
got to think about the audience."

47:25.666 --> 47:27.865
It is brilliant.
It is one of those acts,

47:27.866 --> 47:30.105
once you have seen,
you are never going to forget it.

47:30.106 --> 47:32.945
I would love to see you
in the final.

47:32.946 --> 47:36.905
They've said it all.
Fantastic comments from the judges.

47:36.906 --> 47:40.425
Is there anything you would like
to say to the judges?

47:40.426 --> 47:43.785
I feel absolutely amazing right now.

47:43.786 --> 47:48.465
I am blown away by the love
of the judges and the audience.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.585
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Thank you.

47:50.586 --> 47:58.225
If Lost Voice Guy is your favourite,
that is how to vote for him.

47:58.226 --> 48:01.745
But not yet. Don't vote until you've
seen the last act.

48:01.746 --> 48:05.745
Another standing ovation
for Lost Voice Guy!

48:05.746 --> 48:07.746
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

48:12.626 --> 48:14.825
Time for another break,

48:14.826 --> 48:16.745
but we'll be right back

48:16.746 --> 48:19.425
with one of the most dangerous acts
we've ever had.

48:19.426 --> 48:22.786
Escapologist Matt Johnson.
See you in a few minutes.

48:29.391 --> 48:31.829
Welcome back, live,
to Britain's Got Talent.

48:31.830 --> 48:35.546
I've been joined by some of the acts
who've already performed tonight.

48:35.547 --> 48:37.626
A lot of relief in this area.

48:37.627 --> 48:40.026
Next up is an escapologist,

48:40.027 --> 48:42.626
whose audition terrified everyone
in the theatre

48:42.627 --> 48:44.523
when he locked himself
in a tank full of water.

48:44.525 --> 48:47.764
Tonight, he's promised to take his
act to the next level.

48:47.765 --> 48:50.044
Please do not try this at home.

48:50.045 --> 48:52.005
It's Matt Johnson.

48:53.685 --> 48:56.324
My name is Matt Johnson.
I am from Rotherham originally.

48:56.325 --> 48:58.924
But I am currently living
in Vancouver.

48:58.925 --> 49:01.604
I am an escapologist
and magician and illusionist.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.884
I have been doing it
since I was a little boy.

49:03.885 --> 49:05.925
It is all I have ever wanted to do.

49:08.965 --> 49:12.204
I use real locks, real chains

49:12.205 --> 49:15.085
and really dangerous positions
where I could die.

49:16.405 --> 49:18.045
On the day of the first audition...

49:19.765 --> 49:21.564
I felt like I was out of my depth.

49:21.565 --> 49:24.604
I was in there a lot longer
than I thought I was gonna be.

49:24.605 --> 49:26.845
It was painful and it hurt.

49:28.165 --> 49:31.044
My brother Jonathan is the most
courageous guy I know.

49:31.045 --> 49:33.364
He has seizures,
and he cannot breathe.

49:33.365 --> 49:35.244
That's why I hold my breath.

49:35.245 --> 49:38.164
It puts me closer to understanding
what he goes through.

49:38.165 --> 49:40.004
I'm really nervous about this.

49:40.005 --> 49:42.564
The act I'm doing tonight I have
never done before.

49:42.565 --> 49:45.884
There's a good chance I could die.

49:45.885 --> 49:47.724
OK, guys get him out now.

49:47.725 --> 49:50.524
What you are about to see is 25
years of my life

49:50.525 --> 49:53.044
brought down to just a few minutes.

49:53.045 --> 49:57.045
This moment is the biggest moment
of my life.

50:01.045 --> 50:03.404
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:03.405 --> 50:06.804
'What you are about to see
is extremely dangerous

50:06.805 --> 50:10.324
and should not be attempted
under any circumstances.

50:10.325 --> 50:14.604
I can only describe the position
I am about to put myself in

50:14.605 --> 50:16.644
as hell on earth.

50:16.645 --> 50:21.804
If you thought my first audition was
dangerous, you've seen nothing yet.

50:21.805 --> 50:25.364
I am being locked into
a solid steel straight jacket,

50:25.365 --> 50:27.204
secured with padlocks.

50:27.205 --> 50:30.204
The jacket will be clamped shut
around my chest.

50:30.205 --> 50:33.444
That alone makes it difficult
to breathe.

50:33.445 --> 50:36.284
A clear box will then be placed
over my head

50:36.285 --> 50:40.164
and secured around my neck
with two more padlocks.

50:40.165 --> 50:44.364
Once the solid steel bar is in
place, it clamps the box to my neck,

50:44.365 --> 50:46.844
meaning there is only one way out.

50:46.845 --> 50:49.884
Two chains will then be wrapped
around my body

50:49.885 --> 50:52.724
and secured to my wrists
with regulation handcuffs.

50:52.725 --> 50:56.924
Finally, as the box squeezes tight
around my neck,

50:56.925 --> 50:59.844
I will struggle to get the oxygen
I need into my lungs

50:59.845 --> 51:02.164
before the box is filled with water

51:02.165 --> 51:05.244
and all the ways of gaining oxygen
are closed off.

51:05.245 --> 51:09.564
I will use a single lock pick
to make my escape.

51:09.988 --> 51:13.587
Both the straight jacket
and the box's grip around my neck

51:13.588 --> 51:16.547
restrict my ability to take in
the oxygen I need,

51:16.548 --> 51:20.827
and that's why this is one of the
most dangerous escapes ever
performed.

51:20.828 --> 51:25.187
If I am without breath for longer
than one minute and 45 seconds,

51:25.188 --> 51:26.987
I'm in trouble.

51:26.988 --> 51:31.268
Once this escape begins,
it cannot be stopped.'

Yes?

What did you think of that?
Oh, my God.

I kind of hate it. I really hate it.

54:56.748 --> 54:59.987
I hold my breath with you
for the entire thing.

54:59.988 --> 55:02.827

nearly passed out myself.

You are amazingly nuts.

55:05.188 --> 55:08.347

You are very brave.

and I am glad you are still alive.

55:16.108 --> 55:17.987
You know what?

55:17.988 --> 55:23.587
You are a lunatic, but you have a
great sense of drama and theatrics.

55:23.588 --> 55:25.347
But here's the weird thing.

55:25.348 --> 55:28.467
If we vote you through,
or the audience does,

55:28.468 --> 55:33.027
they are voting you through
in the hope that you might die.

55:33.028 --> 55:36.067
(LAUGHTER)
That is just you.

55:36.068 --> 55:39.827
That's the truth, David.
That is why they are voting.

55:39.828 --> 55:44.307
This is the perfect act for anyone
who likes to watch someone drown.

55:44.308 --> 55:46.947
This is basically
what we are watching.

55:46.948 --> 55:55.147
Your bravery is incredible.
Your showmanship is incredible.

55:55.148 --> 55:56.987
We have not seen anything like it.

55:56.988 --> 56:00.267
I was very worried for you
when the paramedic came on.

56:00.268 --> 56:02.187
I just love your face.

56:02.188 --> 56:06.667
When the water comes out
and you are like...

56:06.668 --> 56:11.547
"I am free!" I love it. Absolutely.
Something very different.

56:11.548 --> 56:14.587
I think you are brilliant.
I found it really funny.

56:14.588 --> 56:16.427
More funny than I did
in the audition.

56:16.428 --> 56:18.627
What kind of sick sense of humour
have you got?

56:18.628 --> 56:21.387
It was funny!
Why was it funny?

56:21.388 --> 56:25.147
It just... It was funny. Is someone
nearly dying funny to you?

56:25.148 --> 56:28.227
You need help. I trust that
he knows what he's doing.

56:28.228 --> 56:31.627
It was brilliant. You created
a great atmosphere. Well done.

56:31.628 --> 56:35.627
So incredibly stressful to watch.

56:35.628 --> 56:38.947
How do you remain calm
in the middle of all of that?

56:38.948 --> 56:41.627
With great difficulty.

56:41.628 --> 56:45.827
The thing about it is I have
to try and calm myself

56:45.828 --> 56:49.587
because the second that I panic,
it is over.

56:49.588 --> 56:51.507
I don't know how long it was,

56:51.508 --> 56:55.547
but a couple of minutes
is a seriously long time.

56:55.548 --> 56:58.867
Millions of people around the country
are trying to catch the breath

56:58.868 --> 57:02.467
after watching that.
It is such a stressful watch.

57:02.468 --> 57:06.307
If you want to send Matt to the
final, details are on your screen.

57:06.308 --> 57:10.147
The vote opens after the last act
has left the stage.

57:10.148 --> 57:12.947
One more time, Matt Johnson,
everybody.

57:12.948 --> 57:14.628
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:20.588 --> 57:22.587
Time for another quick break.

57:22.588 --> 57:25.107
We'll be right back with the last act
of the night.

57:25.108 --> 57:28.027
A patriotic performance
from The D-Day Darlings.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.227
Plus, we open the phone lines

57:30.228 --> 57:32.627
and you start voting
for your favourites.

57:32.629 --> 57:34.549
See you in a few minutes.

57:39.795 --> 57:41.794
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:42.231 --> 57:45.351
Welcome back to - Get out of it, you.

57:46.591 --> 57:48.750
Another stage invader.

57:48.751 --> 57:52.551
Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent,
here in the dress circle.

57:53.951 --> 57:55.870
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

57:55.871 --> 58:01.110
Or the dress-down circle,
by the looks of it this evening.

58:01.111 --> 58:04.230
Our final act of the night
are a singing group

58:04.231 --> 58:06.950
who are bursting
with patriotic pride.

58:06.951 --> 58:09.551
It's The D-Day Darlings.

58:14.591 --> 58:16.550
We are The D-Day Darlings.

58:16.551 --> 58:20.310
We are here because it is almost 100
years since the end of World War I.

58:20.311 --> 58:23.510
It's so important that we keep
those memories alive.

58:23.511 --> 58:26.230
So many great men and women have
given their lives,

58:26.231 --> 58:27.911
and continue to do so.

58:35.151 --> 58:38.070
My grandfather flew Lancaster
bombers in World War II.

58:38.071 --> 58:41.430
My great-grandfather was a Home
Guard during the Sheffield blitz.

58:41.431 --> 58:44.711
My auntie currently serves in the
RAF as a Flight Sergeant.

58:46.751 --> 58:49.390
This performance is dedicated
to all of our heroes

58:49.391 --> 58:51.310
who fought for our freedom.

58:51.311 --> 58:53.510
Performing for veterans
is probably one

58:53.511 --> 58:56.710
of the most amazing experiences
you could have.

58:56.711 --> 58:59.270
The feeling we get from singing
these songs for those heroes,

58:59.271 --> 59:01.990
taking them back to that time
is indescribable.

59:01.991 --> 59:06.230
Tonight, we will sing our hearts
and make Britain proud

59:06.231 --> 59:08.190
and we're gonna do it
for the veterans

59:08.191 --> 59:10.471
and everybody
who's fought for our country.

59:25.322 --> 59:28.321
# When Britain first

59:28.322 --> 59:32.521
# At heaven's command

59:32.522 --> 59:36.761
# Arose from out the azure main

59:36.762 --> 59:38.721
# Arose, arose

59:38.722 --> 59:43.041
# Arose from out the azure main

59:43.042 --> 59:45.561
# Rule, Britannia

59:45.562 --> 59:48.761
# Britannia, rule the waves

59:48.762 --> 59:54.841
# Britons never, never,
never shall be slaves

59:54.842 --> 59:57.361
# Rule, Britannia

59:57.362 --> 01:00:00.521
# Britannia, rule the waves

01:00:00.522 --> 01:00:06.402
# Britons never, never,
never shall be slaves

01:00:07.882 --> 01:00:13.561
# Land of hope and glory

01:00:13.562 --> 01:00:19.441
# Mother of the free

01:00:19.442 --> 01:00:25.041
# How shall we extol thee

01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:30.681
# Who are born of thee

01:00:30.682 --> 01:00:36.321
# Land of hope and glory

01:00:36.322 --> 01:00:42.161
# Mother of the free

01:00:42.162 --> 01:00:47.761
# God who made thee mighty

01:00:47.762 --> 01:00:53.481
# Make thee mightier yet

01:00:53.482 --> 01:00:58.721
# God who made thee mighty

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:13.562
# Make thee mightier yet #

01:01:17.602 --> 01:01:19.602
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:01:34.362 --> 01:01:38.882
Ladies, come on in.

01:01:40.962 --> 01:01:44.921
Goodness me. What a way to end
the first semi-final. Simon?

01:01:44.922 --> 01:01:46.842
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:54.122
We have had it all tonight.

01:01:56.282 --> 01:02:00.921
We really have had it all tonight,
Dec.

01:02:00.922 --> 01:02:03.521
I feel like I am judging
two acts tonight.

01:02:03.522 --> 01:02:06.601
I'm judging the the first act,
the girls,

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:09.881
the ladies, who are very respectful.

01:02:09.882 --> 01:02:12.961
I get what you do and you do it
very, very well.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.321
I congratulate you.

01:02:15.322 --> 01:02:19.321
I would also like to congratulate
the gentlemen behind you.

01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:21.322
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:02:25.402 --> 01:02:33.521
Because it is a reminder that if
it was not for people like them,

01:02:33.522 --> 01:02:36.921
a lot of us would not be sitting
here today, genuinely.

01:02:36.922 --> 01:02:41.762
So I respect you and I salute you.
Thank you.

01:02:43.842 --> 01:02:46.841
Well, I mean, if that does not
get you through

01:02:46.842 --> 01:02:50.161
to the finals of Britain's Got
Talent, what will?

01:02:50.162 --> 01:02:54.601
It was the most incredible
celebration of this country

01:02:54.602 --> 01:02:56.601
and I think we are all
feeling patriotic,

01:02:56.602 --> 01:02:58.521
coming after the Royal Wedding.

01:02:58.522 --> 01:03:03.281
Feeling nostalgic and that was
absolutely wonderful. Well done.

01:03:03.282 --> 01:03:08.001
You sounded absolutely beautiful.

01:03:08.002 --> 01:03:09.881
I feel very proud to be British.

01:03:09.882 --> 01:03:11.921
I wish you all of the best.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:14.322
I hope people pick up the phone
for you. Well done.

01:03:17.522 --> 01:03:19.121
I have to say,

01:03:19.122 --> 01:03:21.721
I thought you were all beautiful
singers in your audition,

01:03:21.722 --> 01:03:25.761
but it was really nice to hear you
all sing properly now.

01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:27.641
The three of you were fantastic.

01:03:27.642 --> 01:03:32.922
I completely lost it and burst into
tears when the boys came on.

01:03:34.842 --> 01:03:37.081
Honestly, it made...

01:03:37.082 --> 01:03:41.521
We are a great nation
and it is important not to forget.

01:03:41.522 --> 01:03:45.121
Thank you very much, judges.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:47.001
I cannot think of a better way

01:03:47.002 --> 01:03:49.921
to have ended this first live
semi-final. Incredible.

01:03:49.922 --> 01:03:53.521
If you think The D-Day Darlings are
one of this year's finalists,

01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:56.361
their details are on your screen now.

01:03:56.362 --> 01:04:00.361
Now, one more time, let's hear it
for The D-Day Darlings!

01:04:00.362 --> 01:04:06.402
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:04:09.962 --> 01:04:12.162
And the vote is now open.

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:18.561
It will close
during tonight's Results Show.

01:04:18.562 --> 01:04:24.121
From a landline, call 09020 44 24
or from mobiles only, it's 6 44 24,

01:04:24.122 --> 01:04:27.001
and then add 01 for CALI SWING,

01:04:27.002 --> 01:04:30.281
02 for LIFFORD SHILLINGFORD,

01:04:30.282 --> 01:04:32.361
03 for SHAMEER RAYES,

01:04:32.362 --> 01:04:34.441
04 for MADDOX DIXON.

01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:38.801
If your choice for the final
is ELLIE &amp; JEKI, it's 05,

01:04:38.802 --> 01:04:40.921
for LOST VOICE GUY, add 06

01:04:40.922 --> 01:04:43.001
07 for MATT JOHNSON

01:04:43.002 --> 01:04:46.001
and 08 for THE D-DAY DARLINGS.

01:04:46.002 --> 01:04:49.121
Votes cost 50 pence
plus any network access charge.

01:04:49.122 --> 01:04:52.081
15 pence from each phone vote

01:05:05.722 --> 01:05:08.281
Here's a quick look back
at all of tonight's talent

01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:10.362
and how to vote for your favourites.

01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:14.922
(LATIN MUSIC)

01:05:36.402 --> 01:05:39.241
# I said something wrong

01:05:39.242 --> 01:05:40.881
# Now I long...

01:05:40.882 --> 01:05:45.282

# SNOOP DOGG: Sweat

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:07.761
You realise you never needed
anybody else's help.

01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:10.361
You just had to be able to imagine

01:06:10.362 --> 01:06:13.601
that nothing...

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.602
is impossible.

# I think I want to marry you

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.321
# Is it that look in your eyes?

01:06:28.322 --> 01:06:31.442
# Or is it this dancing juice?

01:06:32.682 --> 01:06:34.881
# Who cares, baby?

01:06:34.882 --> 01:06:36.882
# I think I want to marry you #

01:06:38.322 --> 01:06:40.401
It is such an honour
to be performing here.

01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:44.681
I hope my parents
can be proud of me now

01:06:44.682 --> 01:06:47.041
because it has been 37 years,

01:06:47.042 --> 01:06:48.881
and they are still waiting to hear

01:06:48.882 --> 01:06:52.642
if my first word
is going to be 'Mummy' or 'Daddy'.

That's it from us for now.

01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:37.881
Stay tuned for Corrie. It's slightly
later tonight at five past nine.

01:07:37.882 --> 01:07:42.121
Apologies for that. They want revenge
of Pat Phelan, and why wouldn't they?

01:07:42.122 --> 01:07:44.921
We'll see you back here
in half an hour for the Results,

01:07:44.922 --> 01:07:47.521
when we find out which two acts
have made it to the final.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.561
Plus, we've got
a very special performance

01:07:49.562 --> 01:07:51.481
from the cast of West End smash,
Matilda.

01:07:51.482 --> 01:07:53.521
