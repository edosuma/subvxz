00:01.653 --> 00:03.525
[male narrator]
Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:03.612 --> 00:05.962
[Ultra Violet]
What a beautiful night
for a little mayhem.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.529
[Lloyd]
The whole palace
is rigged to explode.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.573
[Cole]
We've to get the royal family

00:08.660 --> 00:10.488
out of here.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.055
[Nya]
I'm sorry,
but they didn't make it.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.101
We'll find the people
responsible for this.

00:14.188 --> 00:17.060
[theme music]

00:34.295 --> 00:35.687
[thunder rumbling]

00:35.774 --> 00:37.515
[evil laugh]

00:41.519 --> 00:45.045
[male narrator]
Episode 77,
The Oni And The Dragon.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.830
[instrumental music]

00:54.967 --> 00:56.186
splash

01:01.670 --> 01:03.106
[seagulls squawking]

01:08.764 --> 01:11.723
Is this where we'll be living?

01:11.810 --> 01:14.291
Just until we know you're safe.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.163
Don't you have a headquarters?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.555
It's too in the open.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.080
The Sons of Garmadon
will be looking for you.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.082
We'll need to keep movin'.

01:26.173 --> 01:31.526
So, Harumi, looks like we're
gonna be roomies for a while.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.746
You have all been so gracious
to take me in

01:34.833 --> 01:38.837
since our palace
was, uh, taken away.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.491
- 'And--'
- You're safe with us.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.277
Uh, that assumption is not
entirely justified, Jay.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.061
We know very little
about the Sons of Garmadon's

01:45.148 --> 01:46.410
full capabilities.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.499
We know nothing
about them. Period.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.546
We do know they're after
the three Oni masks.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.288
Unfortunately,
they already have two of them.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.420
P.I.X.A.L. scanned everywhere
for the third mask

01:56.507 --> 01:57.900
but it came up empty.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.989
It's as if it never existed.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.644
Then we need to focus
on who's giving the orders.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.907
A group this organized
must have a leader.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.300
Maybe someone from our past?

02:06.387 --> 02:10.434
Uh, forgive me,
but is that underwear?

02:10.521 --> 02:13.133
[chuckles]
So, uh, we're usually
more organized.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.526
[clears throat]
But our leader got lost
in a time stream.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.833
- Uh, they're Cole's.
- They're blue.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.183
[chuckles]
You're lucky
they're not yellow.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.750
[chuckles]

02:21.837 --> 02:23.055
What about the suspect captured

02:23.143 --> 02:25.145
at the heist in Borg Tower?

02:25.232 --> 02:26.668
I can stay behind with Harumi

02:26.755 --> 02:28.409
if you wanna press him
on who he works for.

02:28.496 --> 02:29.975
[P.I.X.A.L.]
'The police have him in custody'

02:30.062 --> 02:31.368
'but he has refused to talk.'

02:31.455 --> 02:32.848
'He's set for release today.'

02:32.935 --> 02:35.372
Then if Johnny Law
can't get him to talk

02:35.459 --> 02:37.853
perhaps Johnny Ninja can?

02:41.552 --> 02:44.164
Uh, I thought we were in a hurry
to get to the police.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.688
[Lloyd]
A quick stop.
If the perp won't talk

02:46.775 --> 02:49.865
maybe we can get something
to loosen his lips.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.606
Mistake's Tea Shop.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.912
I wonder what magical tea
she can brew up for us.

02:56.045 --> 02:59.396
- Is Mistake here?
- Never heard of her.

02:59.483 --> 03:03.444
Oh, apologies,
young Lloyd Garmadon.

03:03.531 --> 03:06.577
I didn't recognize your voice.

03:06.664 --> 03:09.624
Oh, it's so good
to see you again.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.365
It's been years.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.844
Hello, Mistake.

03:12.931 --> 03:16.021
I'm sorry to hear
about Master Wu.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.154
He was a dear friend.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.461
Was?
We haven't given up on him.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.593
We just have
more urgent problems.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.162
- We seek--
- The Tea of Truth!

03:26.249 --> 03:30.688
- Oh, she's good.
- But be forewarned.

03:30.775 --> 03:34.257
The truth can be dangerous.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.695
She's also creepy.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.002
Apart for the course
in a mystical tea shop, Jay.

03:40.089 --> 03:43.745
I'll have a look in the back
to see if I have any.

03:43.832 --> 03:47.792
But don't touch anything!

03:50.055 --> 03:53.494
Like I said, creepy.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.500
Mistake, wait. That painting.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.937
Hm? Oh, yes.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.722
The Oni and the Dragon.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.725
But you are not ready
for that tale.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.859
Please. We need to know.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.950
It is a long tale.
Do you have the time?

04:15.037 --> 04:16.734
We only have time
for a quick stop.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.171
Cole and Zane, go to the police
with the Tea of Truth

04:19.259 --> 04:20.782
and find out
who's giving the orders.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.914
Jay and I will stay here
to learn more.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.831
Come, my child.

04:26.918 --> 04:31.793
To know the tale,
you must drink the tea.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.364
- Ugh, I'm innocent!
- Tell it to the judge.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.192
I am the judge!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.151
This cup contains
the Tea of Truth.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.674
This other one is for you.

04:43.761 --> 04:47.809
Ha! Nothin' like good
old-fashioned detective work.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.420
- I know my way, coppers!
- Stop him!

04:50.507 --> 04:51.639
[grunts]

04:51.726 --> 04:52.857
No!

04:52.944 --> 04:54.032
crack

04:54.119 --> 04:55.512
[screaming]

04:55.599 --> 04:56.905
[gasping]

04:58.689 --> 05:01.779
That didn't go
the way I pictured.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.694
[laughs]
I didn't even spill a drop.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.131
- Are you ready?
- Uh, uh, of course.

05:07.698 --> 05:08.960
[Cole]
'Uh..'

05:13.922 --> 05:15.793
Who turned off the heat?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.188
Ninja. Hmph.

05:19.275 --> 05:22.452
- What do you two want?
- Luke Cunningham.

05:22.539 --> 05:26.630
Otherwise known
as the Man in the White Mask.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.023
We would like some information

05:28.110 --> 05:30.068
regarding who you work for,
Luke.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.810
Well, I'd like a pepperoni pizza
and some chocolate ice cream

05:32.897 --> 05:33.985
but it ain't gonna happen.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.813
We don't have that

05:35.900 --> 05:40.427
but we do have a cup of hot tea
that could warm you up.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.212
I ain't thirsty.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.997
Mm-mm. It really warms me up.

05:46.084 --> 05:49.000
Sometimes a cup of hot tea
just hits the spot.

05:49.087 --> 05:52.221
- Mmm.
- Like I said, I ain't talkin'.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.701
- Drink it!
- No!

05:53.788 --> 05:55.006
Well, don't you get it?

05:55.093 --> 05:56.399
If you don't drink
the Tea of Truth

05:56.486 --> 05:57.748
we won't get answers.. Oh!

05:57.835 --> 05:59.620
Whoa.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.099
You're trying to trick me?

06:01.186 --> 06:03.624
Cole, I think
you drank the wrong cup.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.757
I see that now,
but in full disclosure

06:06.844 --> 06:09.194
I'm trying my best
to look like I didn't.

06:13.851 --> 06:17.681
- Ah, it's not working, is it?
- Ha. So you can't lie, huh?

06:17.768 --> 06:19.988
Oh. Oh, you pee
in the swimming pool?

06:20.075 --> 06:22.033
Of course, who doesn't? Oh!

06:22.120 --> 06:24.209
[chuckles]
Where are you hiding
the princess?

06:24.296 --> 06:27.212
Oh, the Destiny's Bounty
in a cove of Hollow's Bluff.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.301
But tomorrow we'll be
at the village of Stiix.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.564
You're giving away
all our secrets.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.087
I can't lie!

06:32.174 --> 06:34.568
What sort of power
does the Green Ninja have?

06:34.655 --> 06:37.092
Oh, it's some kind of energy
or green light, I don't know.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.442
Like, all our elemental powers
rolled into one.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.837
Who can say? Come on, Zane.
Knock me out! Do something!

06:42.924 --> 06:46.014
[laughs]
Wait till the the gang
at Laughy's hears about this.

06:46.101 --> 06:49.365
Laughy's? You mean the karaoke
club on the south side?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.454
[laughing]
Oh.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.848
Ha-ha! Who's the sucker now?

06:53.935 --> 06:56.024
Good thing I didn't tell him
about my fear of singing.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.288
Oh. Zane, can we, please,
get out of here?

07:05.773 --> 07:08.123
Ah. Thank you for the tea.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.691
You were right.
It really calmed my nerves.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.606
[sighs]
I feel so..

07:14.085 --> 07:15.913
...warm and fuzzy.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.961
Good. Then the Tea
of Enlightenment is working.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.616
It will help you see the tale.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.661
The original tale.

07:24.748 --> 07:28.665
The tale
of the Oni and the Dragon.

07:28.752 --> 07:32.060
[gasps]
You lied?
Mistake, why would you do that?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.802
- I thought we were friends.
- What are we supposed to see?

07:34.889 --> 07:38.893
See the beginning.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.373
[instrumental music]

07:44.725 --> 07:47.379
[Mistake]
Long before time had a name

07:47.467 --> 07:51.601
there was the realm
of the Oni and the Dragon.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.211
roar

07:53.298 --> 07:54.822
One of the 16 realms?

07:54.909 --> 07:57.781
Not one of. The first.

07:57.868 --> 08:01.916
The dragon
had the power to create.

08:02.003 --> 08:06.007
The Oni
had the power to destroy.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.792
Their war was never-ending.

08:10.751 --> 08:15.799
But a child arrived
born of both worlds.

08:15.886 --> 08:19.499
The child understood
the power of both.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.414
Without one,
you could not have the other.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.721
But when the Oni
and the Dragon fought

08:24.808 --> 08:28.638
over which side
the child should choose

08:28.725 --> 08:31.815
the child abandoned their world

08:31.902 --> 08:34.862
to start a new one called..

08:36.733 --> 08:38.866
'...Ninjago.'

08:38.953 --> 08:42.565
Are you telling me the child
born from both worlds

08:42.652 --> 08:45.220
is the first Spinjitzu master?

08:45.307 --> 08:47.439
Hey, hey. You're related.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.312
[gasps]
That means you're part
Oni and Dragon too.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.141
Like I said,
truth can be dangerous.

08:53.228 --> 08:57.885
'After the first Spinjitzu
master created Ninjago'

08:57.972 --> 09:01.236
he fathered two sons
of his own.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.151
He thought
he could escape the war.

09:03.238 --> 09:06.894
He saw the evil of the Oni
was waiting to be unleashed

09:06.981 --> 09:12.464
in one of his sons,
Lord Garmadon!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.554
It was up to Master Wu

09:14.641 --> 09:18.819
to control his brother's
undying thirst to destroy.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.821
- And with some help--
- Hey!

09:20.908 --> 09:22.518
[laughs]
That's us.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.000
Have some more tea.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.480
'Lord Garmadon was destroyed'

09:28.568 --> 09:32.267
by the most powerful force
of all

09:32.354 --> 09:34.356
...the love of his own son.

09:38.403 --> 09:42.407
But in his absence,
a void was created

09:42.494 --> 09:46.803
and in that void,
a new darkness has arisen.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.849
The Sons of Garmadon.

09:48.936 --> 09:53.027
The three Oni Masks are relics
from the first realm.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.595
And they wield tremendous power.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.946
The power to deceive.
The power of vengeance.

09:59.033 --> 10:02.384
The power to hate.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.777
What happens
when they're united?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.388
You cannot let that happen.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.652
Tell me. What happens when
the three masks are united?

10:09.739 --> 10:11.698
[intense music]

10:11.785 --> 10:13.656
Resurrection.

10:13.743 --> 10:18.139
They will have the power
to bring back your father.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.187
But it won't be the man
you recognize.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.147
There will be no light
left in him.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.241
[instrumental music]

10:56.264 --> 10:57.657
[Nya]
'You can believe it.'

10:57.744 --> 11:00.877
- That used to be Lord Garmadon.
- Lloyd's father?

11:00.964 --> 11:04.402
He made some mistakes,
but he's made up for them.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.840
I've heard
so many stories of him.

11:06.927 --> 11:10.539
Such anger.
He hurt so many people.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.019
How did he change?

11:12.106 --> 11:14.151
Master Wu once told me

11:14.238 --> 11:18.025
holding on to anger is like
trying to throw a hot rock.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.157
Only you get burned.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.813
Lloyd helped
his father...let go.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.815
But all of that
is behind us now.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.557
- So I thought.
- Lloyd, you're back.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.212
Where is Zane and Cole?
I need to see everyone.

11:31.299 --> 11:34.868
Following a lead.
Why? Is everything okay?

11:36.478 --> 11:38.393
The Sons of Garmadon
want to bring back

11:38.480 --> 11:40.177
my father from the dead.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.352
[both gasp]

11:42.745 --> 11:44.878
[instrumental music]

11:50.318 --> 11:52.189
[indistinct chatter]

11:53.321 --> 11:54.844
[engine revving]

12:06.682 --> 12:08.945
Our informant's intel
has paid off.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.905
Two high-ranking
Sons of Garmadon just arrived.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.820
The one they call Ultra Violet

12:13.907 --> 12:16.083
and the mysterious man
with the swords.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.433
Good,
then we're one step closer

12:18.520 --> 12:20.478
to finding out who's in charge.
