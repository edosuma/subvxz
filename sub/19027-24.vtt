WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:04.296
 It's springtime at Sacred Heart,

00:04.404 --> 00:07.635
and the whole hospital
had that endoftheyear smell.

00:07.707 --> 00:11.541
Gloria, I need you to change
the dressing on Mr. Kerns' wound.

00:11.611 --> 00:13.636
And I need you to suck it.

00:13.713 --> 00:15.578
Wow, Gloria. Do you kiss your

00:15.648 --> 00:18.947
greatgreatgreatgreatgreat
grandkids with that mouth?

00:19.019 --> 00:21.249
# Zoomzoomzoom #

00:21.321 --> 00:23.551
Ted, that's funny.
Where's the chuckle?

00:23.623 --> 00:26.091
The bank foreclosed on my house.

00:26.159 --> 00:29.788
 Where's your mom?
 She's out in the car with the cats.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.889
Dr. Kelso celebrated spring
by wearing his golf shorts

00:32.966 --> 00:35.457
to flaunt his oddly
youthful legs.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.493
Take them in, people.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.396
I shaved for you.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.510
Tell your Daddy what you just did.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.183
I made a poopy in the potty.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.185
You know, son, as a doctor,

00:53.253 --> 00:56.416
I spend a lot of my day
dealing with other people's poop.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.356
And I'm not going to lie to you,
Jackie, it gets old.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.792
Now that's, that's not to say

01:01.895 --> 01:06.161
I haven't enjoyed waking up to
a fresh brown trout in your Huggies.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.565
Besides, you're gonna do the
same thing for me some day real soon.

01:09.636 --> 01:12.935
And yet, aside from actually
seeing you being born

01:13.006 --> 01:16.567
and that time Wayne Gretzky said,
"What's up" to me in line at the bank,

01:16.676 --> 01:19.907
you out of diapers is the best
thing that's ever happened.

01:19.979 --> 01:23.710
It truly is. Now why don't you go into
your room and play for a little while

01:23.783 --> 01:26.343
because we're going
to celebrate grownup style.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.220
All right, get this over with. I need
a nap. I've been exhausted all week.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.454
 Yippee!
 No kissing. Hands behind your back.

01:34.527 --> 01:35.858
Let's go.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.092
Yep, love was definitely in the air.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.326
Hey, Kim. How'd you like
a night on the town

01:41.434 --> 01:43.925
with the hottest doctor
in this place?

01:44.003 --> 01:48.531
I'd rather just go out with you.
Oh! # Zoomzoomzoom #

01:48.608 --> 01:51.042
 You "zoomzoomzoom"?
 Of course.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.739
 I invented the zoomzoomzoom.
 Oh. Cool.

01:53.813 --> 01:54.871
Liar!

01:54.948 --> 01:59.282
So, Josh, you are suffering from
a condition called phimosis.

01:59.352 --> 02:02.116
It's basically a hardening
of your foreskin.

02:02.222 --> 02:06.591
As part of your treatment, I'm asking
you to masturbate five times a week.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.422
Help the poor kid out.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.862
Wow, five times a week, huh?
For me that would be cutting back.

02:11.931 --> 02:15.162
He said in front of
his future girlfriend.

02:16.002 --> 02:19.335
You know what?
I should probably mosey.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.205
Looking forward to our date.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.049
See you around 6:00.
Wear something slutty.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.885
# Zoomzoomzoom! #

02:37.991 --> 02:39.720
That's mine.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.127
# I can't do this all on my own

02:44.197 --> 02:47.496
# No, I know I'm no Superman

02:50.803 --> 02:52.737
# I'm no Superman #

02:55.375 --> 02:59.641
 Oh. You like that?
 Wow, I felt it move.

02:59.712 --> 03:03.546
 Todd, you're touching your crotch.
 I know. And I'm loving it.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.683
Hey, tubby.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.414
J.D., come here.
I want you to feel something quick.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.654
Ow!

03:11.724 --> 03:13.089
Don't call me tubby.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.956
Pregnant witch.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.586
Hey. There's Kim.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.462
She and Elliot bonded over an ability
to communicate at a speed of light.

03:24.637 --> 03:27.663
You'd have to slow it down
for humans to understand.

03:28.441 --> 03:32.104
The shower's going to start at 4:00,
there's going to be food and games.

03:32.178 --> 03:35.807
You're such a good friend. I got her
a present, but since we're not close

03:35.882 --> 03:38.350
I'm just going home
to get ready for my date.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.478
Oh. Hey, you.
I'm psyched for tonight.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.685
Best thing about a date with J.D., if
you're having Chinese and want Mexican,

03:46.759 --> 03:49.091
you walk to the other
side of the food court.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.187
We are not going to the mall, Elliot.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.596
I was making you dinner,
then go to karaoke,

03:53.666 --> 03:56.430
but I'm not sure how to
do both in the same night.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.265
Unless, of course...

03:58.338 --> 04:00.306
J.D. Not Floating Head Doctor.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.307
Too late. I'm already there.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.379
Body could stay home
and prepare the feast.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.614
And as always...

04:12.685 --> 04:14.812
Head would handle entertainment.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.623
# Don't go breaking my heart

04:20.692 --> 04:24.527
# I couldn't if I tried

04:24.597 --> 04:27.760
# Oh, honey if I get restless

04:27.834 --> 04:29.358
Stop hogging the mic!

04:29.435 --> 04:31.130
Body, come!

04:37.143 --> 04:38.838
 Oh!

04:38.911 --> 04:40.344
 Stupid body.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.711
I gotta do everything myself.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.454
# Oohhoo, nobody knows it

04:48.521 --> 04:51.684
Clap with me, clap with me!
# Nobody knows...

04:52.558 --> 04:54.423
Head loves karaoke.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.622
I'm up for anything.
I married my high school boyfriend,

04:57.697 --> 05:00.063
the only first date I went on
was in tenth grade.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.134
It began with me in
the back of his Miata

05:02.201 --> 05:04.135
because his friend called shotgun

05:04.203 --> 05:06.865
and ended with us going to
the arcade to, and I quote,

05:06.939 --> 05:10.238
"Eat pizza and beat up nerds."
And I married that guy.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.939
Well, trust me, Kim.
I've beaten up many a nerds in my day,

05:14.013 --> 05:16.914
but tonight's about you
having the best first date ever.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.951
All right, slugger.

05:20.086 --> 05:23.249
 Bye!
 You don't have anything planned.

05:23.356 --> 05:28.089
You had to soil the food court thing.
It's veal piccata night at Sbarro's.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.823
I'd help, but I'm
planning a baby shower for Carla.

05:30.897 --> 05:35.266
I am going to make this cafeteria
look totally different.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.499
# Baby, baby,

05:42.608 --> 05:45.634
# Baby, oooh

05:45.712 --> 05:50.206
# I want my baby back, baby back, baby
back, baby back, baby back, baby back

05:50.283 --> 05:52.547
 # I want my baby back, baby back
 # Chili's

05:52.618 --> 05:54.108
# Baby back ribs

05:54.187 --> 05:58.089
 # I want my baby back ribs
 # Barbecue sauce

05:58.157 --> 06:00.990
 # I want my baby back, baby back
 # Chili's...

06:01.060 --> 06:02.391
Ted, what the hell?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.623
It's the only song we know
with "baby."

06:04.697 --> 06:06.392
I want my money back.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.991
 What money?
 What? I lost my house.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.126
Give me a break.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.569
Fun, right?

06:12.672 --> 06:14.640
No one is mingling.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.834
Why are the morgue guys
so damn cliquey?

06:16.909 --> 06:18.877
I want yellow.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.414
I wish I had cool morgue friends.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.246
Hey guys!

06:25.351 --> 06:27.114
 Ooooh!
 Oh.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.019
Laverne, I didn't know you knit.

06:30.089 --> 06:33.525
I sure do. Mr. Roberts doesn't have
one pair of storebought socks.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.322
I'm gonna knit you a muzzle.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.090
Those are all from us.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.495
 It's just Jack's old baby crap.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.534
We're really excited
to get rid of all that stuff

06:42.602 --> 06:44.934
and watch you guys suffer
through the hellish

06:45.004 --> 06:48.770
relationshipruining nightmare
that is the baby phase.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.809
 Open something.
 Go ahead.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.313
 Those are my workout pants.
 Uhhuh.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.781
She's been trying to get rid of
those, but I'll be honest with you,

06:57.884 --> 07:01.752
I love them cause they're so comfortable
and you can get them on real quick.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.157
You ain't lying.

07:05.224 --> 07:07.192
Baby, check it out.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.858
Wonderful. Thank you.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.962
Why can't we just talk to people?

07:13.032 --> 07:14.761
This is the baby games station.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.699
Once we start,
people will join us.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.829
OK, guess what flavor
baby food this is?

07:22.041 --> 07:25.204
 Cab driver feet?
 No, Keith, it's turnips!

07:25.278 --> 07:27.439
You got it wrong,
finish the whole jar!

07:27.513 --> 07:29.003
You guys, this is so much fun!

07:31.350 --> 07:33.580
Where the hell are
all your intern friends?

07:36.556 --> 07:38.421
Listen up, interns.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.824
Notice the definition
in the upper calf.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.418
Look at it, damn it!

07:44.163 --> 07:45.323
See that?

07:45.398 --> 07:49.562
Back in 'Nam, the choppers would hover
eight feet above my head, I'd jump in.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.001
You should've seen
the look on Charlie's face.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.402
Not the enemy, son,
the pilot, Charlie Ross.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.999
Great guy. He didn't make it back.

07:57.076 --> 08:00.102
 Where's the cake?
 Eight feet? I don't believe it.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.346
Believe that, missy.

08:05.451 --> 08:08.318
I have to get ready. I want
my date with Kim to be perfect.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.845
What do you think about a romantic
horseback ride on the beach?

08:11.924 --> 08:14.085
 Like we did for your birthday?
 Yeah.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.527
 Except this time with two horses.
 Why not take her to your deck?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.928
You guys can lie out
and look at the stars.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.762
Unfortunately, I can't.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.861
My deck has become sort of a cruising
spot for older gay gentlemen.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.870
Get off my porch, you old queens.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.443
Who's is this?

08:32.511 --> 08:34.070
Who's is this?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.705
You find somewhere else to hang out!

08:36.782 --> 08:39.546
I know for a fact Les Mis is in town!

08:40.653 --> 08:44.749
I tried turning my hose on them,
but they liked it.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.485
If anything, good luck, buddy.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.618
# Barbecue sauce

08:48.961 --> 08:50.292
 I didn't need luck,

08:50.363 --> 08:53.924
because this was going to be
the most romantic first date ever.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.961
Your steed, my lady.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.937
J.D., I've never ridden
a horse on a beach before.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.507
And upsiedaisy.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.746
Woo! No saddles?
You going to be OK riding bareback?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.517
No problemo.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.455
What's so hard about riding bareback?

09:24.000 --> 09:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:37.610 --> 09:41.046
Oh, that was amazing!
Wasn't that so much fun?

09:41.113 --> 09:42.774
Oh yeah. That was awesome.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.575
Thank you.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.120
Is this for when we
buy the baby a dog?

09:49.188 --> 09:52.351
No. It's a baby cage.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.948
It's a good one, too.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.517
When I was a kid,
mine didn't have these windows.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.861
It's perfect. If you go out for dinner,
it's got a water bottle,

09:59.932 --> 10:03.095
so you throw some cedar chips
in there so the baby can poop,

10:03.169 --> 10:04.534
you're made in the shade.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.970
I'm kidding!

10:08.040 --> 10:10.406
It's for when they
buy the baby a, uh, puppy.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.841
Oh!

10:16.449 --> 10:18.314
This one's from me and Keith.

10:19.051 --> 10:22.179
He's here in the bathroom,
throwing up summer squash.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.880
Let's see here.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.515
Oooh.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.389
It's a preggyteddy.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.521
I got it at that new
maternity lingerie store at the mall.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.862
I had a conversation with
the sweet, old lady who owns the place.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.301
Not many pregnant women shop there.
It's mostly just fat whores.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.339
 Oh.
 I got to get me one of those.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.410
Say, Bobbo. You want to
weigh in on pregnancy sex?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.106
 It's a freak show.
 You've seen an ultrasound.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.148
They have eyes, they have hands.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.979
How do you think they're going
to react to an intruder?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.611
The baby can't
grab me down there.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.214
 The baby can't grab me down there?
 No, baby.

11:02.261 --> 11:05.628
I called an ambulance, but you
should really let me examine you.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.427
Oh, no, no.
The date continues.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.231
I'm a urologist. And there's a
good chance you have testicular torsion.

11:11.303 --> 11:15.069
In which case, you could lose
a testicle. Come on. Off with the pants.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.603
Looks like my plan is working.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.739
Detruser function is normal. One is
significantly larger than the other.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.716
Actually, that's a
preexisting condition.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.720
 So the right one's always been bigger?
 Yes. Wait.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.224
 Your right or stage right?
 Let me test the retraction.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.659
Retracted.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.423
OK, the date's not going
exactly as planned,

11:37.496 --> 11:41.227
but you can still save it with your
legendary gift for smalltalk.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.962
So, you're from Texas, huh?

11:44.036 --> 11:46.903
They say that's the Lone Star State.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.440
What exactly does that mean?

11:50.776 --> 11:53.472
My boobs are so big right now.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.607
I think Dr. Fishman threw in something
a little extra when he did my chin.

11:57.683 --> 12:02.416
Would you, would you like to see
something really, just, beautiful?

12:02.488 --> 12:05.457
There goes all of
Jackieboy's baby stuff.

12:06.692 --> 12:10.822
No, Mom, playpenlbaby cage
is not like tomatoltomahto.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.790
I hope you're not beating
yourself up about this.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.769
Sorry, I wanted to do
something fun for our first date.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.864
No. It was so much more fun
then, then you think.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.501
I mean, the first seven
or eight minutes rocked.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.943
Admittedly, it was more
like work after that.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.310
But at least I got
to third base with you.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.008
And there it was.

12:31.083 --> 12:35.782
The moment where pity was turning into
genuine affection. Classic Dorian.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.618
I feel like we kind of
missed first base.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.152
Me, too.

12:42.228 --> 12:45.197
 Well, maybe we should fix that.
 We should.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.128
And then it happened.

12:49.401 --> 12:52.234
 Elliot Reid. Moment Killer.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.464
What's up, guys?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.408
Tell me every detail about the date.

12:56.475 --> 13:00.241
 We went horseback riding on the beach.
 Yes. I've been on that date.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.338
 Really?
 What? I had a coupon.

13:03.415 --> 13:06.441
I wasn't the only one
to have an uninvited guest.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.044
 You know what sucks?

13:09.121 --> 13:14.058
I didn't even eat any of that crappy
shower food and I still feel nauseous.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.289
In fact, I've been nauseous
for, like, two weeks.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.226
I've been exhausted all week.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.401
My boobs are so big right now.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.009
Yep, I'm pregnant.

13:37.583 --> 13:42.680
I pooped in my bed
so I put it on the TV.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.894
Forgive me, but since
I had a vasectomy last year,

13:53.999 --> 13:58.766
nay, two vasectomies, I feel,
I feel I just have to ask.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.500
 Did you cheat on me?
 No.

14:01.574 --> 14:05.135
 And you know me. I always tell.
 Oh, that's true.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.576
That's pretty much why
we work well together.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.679
Are you responsible for this?

14:13.752 --> 14:15.117
What are you talking about?

14:15.221 --> 14:17.746
I'm selling my old mop.
The 2007 s are in.

14:17.823 --> 14:18.949
Sorry.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.987
All right, Kim's right there.
We spent all morning crafting a line

14:27.066 --> 14:30.160
so raw with confidence,
that if you pull it off,

14:30.236 --> 14:33.399
 you're back in the game.
 I'm afraid, Mocha Bear.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.531
I know. Buck up!

14:37.977 --> 14:40.810
 Hey, Kim.
 Oh, hey, J.D. How're you feeling?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.643
Well, uh...

14:45.217 --> 14:47.344
...the swelling's gone down...

14:48.220 --> 14:49.744
...for now.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.067
You're an idiot.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.797
Go out with me again tonight.

15:05.871 --> 15:10.137
Oh, J.D., I'd love to, but I'm
going to a Neil Diamond concert.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.870
With who?

15:14.546 --> 15:18.107
 Elliot Reid. Moment Killer.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.185
 What's up? Are you psyched?
 Hey.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.583
 I'm so psyched.
 Me too.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.555
# Everywhere around the world

15:25.724 --> 15:28.284
# They're coming to America

15:32.331 --> 15:36.097
Could I, uh, could I
have everybody's attention, please.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.233
Jordan's pregnant.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.397
You get over here, you!

15:40.472 --> 15:43.305
 Not a hug moment, sweetie.
 Right. Yes.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.936
No. But Dr. Cox,

15:47.012 --> 15:50.778
here I thought you and Jordan were done
trying to have any more babies.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.409
We were, but my vasectomy didn't take

15:53.485 --> 15:55.749
which, apparently,
is not that uncommon.

15:55.821 --> 15:59.052
 Holy crap, Dr. Cox.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.821
That must have really pissed you off.
 Yes, it did.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.193
What is, what is your name?

16:05.264 --> 16:08.199
Oh, I'm any generic hospital worker

16:08.267 --> 16:10.326
who happens to ask you a question

16:10.402 --> 16:13.963
about your pregnancy
andlor any babyrelated issues.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.166
 Isn't that nice?

16:17.776 --> 16:20.336
This morality play was made
possible by a grant

16:20.412 --> 16:23.074
from the Just See If
I Was Kidding Foundation.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.144
 Do you want to do it, or should I?
 Let's just do it together.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.492
That's from The Simpsons.

16:35.561 --> 16:36.823
Ah, yes.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.921
I'm having a heart attack.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.805
Did you guys hear what
Jordan and Dr. Cox and did

16:47.873 --> 16:50.205
to the doctor who botched his vasectomy?

16:51.477 --> 16:52.501
Go Ted.

16:52.578 --> 16:56.810
# I want my baby back, baby back, baby
back, baby back, baby back, baby back

16:56.882 --> 17:00.909
# I want my baby back, baby back, baby
back, baby back, baby back, baby back

17:00.986 --> 17:03.546
# I want my baby back, baby back,
baby back, baby back

17:03.622 --> 17:06.853
 Dear God, when do they say "ribs?"
 Never.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.358
They never say "ribs."

17:08.426 --> 17:12.157
# I want my baby back, baby back, baby
back, baby back, baby back, baby back

17:12.231 --> 17:14.994
# I want my baby back, baby back,
baby back, baby back...

17:15.768 --> 17:18.703
I heard ten minutes into it,
he started eating his face.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.738
He did.

17:19.838 --> 17:24.332
You know what J.D.'s got planned since
it's his day off and he's dateless?

17:29.014 --> 17:31.710
This is my first scooter rally.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.752
Do you want to be Ponch or Jon?

17:35.854 --> 17:39.085
I can imagine what Jordan and
Dr. Cox are feeling right now.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.886
Do you really think
we can handle this?

17:45.964 --> 17:47.522
I don't know.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.693
 I can totally
picture J.D., too.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.643
Oh, hey, Mom.

18:07.719 --> 18:11.746
No, I'm just hanging out alone tonight.
I didn't have anything else to do.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.122
We want to give you
your stuff back.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.894
We don't feel like
dealing with that right now.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.094
 How about now?
 Oh.

18:26.905 --> 18:27.963
Come on in.

18:32.377 --> 18:36.438
Ugh. I hate cleaning up
after those messy old queens.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.483
Ooh, appletini?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.314
When did they start
drinking straight guy drinks?

18:41.386 --> 18:43.877
Mmm. It's fresh.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.117
 What's up, chicken butt?

18:46.725 --> 18:48.989
Hey, Kim. What happened
to Neil Diamond?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.188
I haven't seen Keith in a while,
I'm gonna take him.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.993
Kim's letting me off the hook.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.590
Thank you.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.362
You're welcome.

19:04.676 --> 19:08.237
 What's up?
 Nothing.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.415
It seems like good friends
always come through for you

19:12.518 --> 19:14.383
 You like?
 Oh, well.

19:14.453 --> 19:17.820
You know, I could,
I could wear them out to dinner.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.085
 With a sports jacket?
 No.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.661
It's OK. Don't get up.
I got it. 

19:23.729 --> 19:27.062
 OK.
 It's only your child.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.467
Look, I feel like I can
give you a list of things

19:30.536 --> 19:33.164
that are sucky about being pregnant.
For starters,

19:33.238 --> 19:36.605
I'm now horny as I've ever been
and my husband is repulsed by me.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.078
Listen, if you really need it
that badly, I will suck it up

19:40.145 --> 19:42.807
and shut my eyes so tight
and then do you.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.850
 Thank you for the sacrifice.
 It's because I love you.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.714
My point is,

19:47.819 --> 19:50.185
even with all the crap,
I'm sure it's worth it.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.656
I've seen how happy
having Jack has made you two.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.590
And yeah, I know it's been hard,

19:55.661 --> 19:58.789
but I know that neither one of you
regret any of it.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.858
What the hell is this thing?

20:02.968 --> 20:06.426
That's Jack's mobile.
Actually, it's his third mobile.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.871
The first two were
embedded in the drywall.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.238
They can be quite frustrating
to assemble.

20:11.310 --> 20:16.043
Do you remember when he was teething?
He'd stare up at that thing for hours.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.647
Yep.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.885
Why's your TV smell like dodo?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.986
So, what do you want to do tonight?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.993
Just hang here and look at the stars

20:33.098 --> 20:36.795
until we're comfortable enough
to make out a little.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.961
OK. I'm cool with that.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.600
 Not yet.
 Let me know.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.677
And like that, I felt like all was
right with the couples in the world.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.870
OK, now.

21:57.683 --> 22:01.050
And right then, I knew this was the
start of something important.

22:13.231 --> 22:16.564
Two and a half weeks is too long
to wait for a third date.

22:16.635 --> 22:19.001
I'm pregnant.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.766
What now?
