01:41.348 --> 01:44.249
Mr. Chow, the virus that has infected
the mainframe can't be cured.

01:44.485 --> 01:46.851
It's threatening to wipe out the entire
system.

01:47.054 --> 01:51.718
Chairman Chow, you must take
control of the situation immediately.

01:51.925 --> 01:56.021
If this continues, our stock will
plummet when the market opens.

01:56.263 --> 01:59.494
We'll suffer significant losses
in the EU market.

02:00.334 --> 02:03.497
- Chow Lui, what shall we do?
- Pay them off.

02:04.304 --> 02:06.864
If we do,
they'll come back for more.

02:07.107 --> 02:11.305
Our computers are protected by a
world-class first-rate security system.

02:11.512 --> 02:14.879
Clients invest in us because we
guarantee absolute safety.

02:15.115 --> 02:19.643
It's obvious that our mainframe is
being attacked by an external virus.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.321
If we don't pay them off, our reputation
will be ruined.

02:23.524 --> 02:26.516
No amount of money can compensate
for that.

02:30.731 --> 02:33.529
Something called the Computer
Angel is getting rid of the virus!

02:44.444 --> 02:47.470
Thank God! We're fine again.

02:51.084 --> 02:53.245
Find this Computer Angel for me.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.555
Who is this Angel?

02:57.057 --> 02:58.752
Someone we can use.

03:21.682 --> 03:23.582
How can I help you, miss?

03:24.084 --> 03:27.485
- I'm here to see Mr. Chow Lui.
- Who shall I tell him?

03:27.688 --> 03:30.384
- The Computer Angel.
- One moment, please.

03:30.591 --> 03:33.219
You want to buy $20 billion
of Dragon stock.

03:33.427 --> 03:37.454
I think this is crazy.
I won't sanction it.

03:38.298 --> 03:40.960
- Have you thought about...?
<i>- The Computer Angel is here.</i>

03:41.201 --> 03:43.362
May, show her up.

03:43.570 --> 03:44.798
Right away, Chairman Chow.

03:45.072 --> 03:50.032
Alice, please turn down Dragon
on behalf of Nunn.

03:53.213 --> 03:55.647
Sister-in-law, let's discuss this
in my office.

03:55.849 --> 03:59.979
Sure. Don't stay too late tonight.

04:00.654 --> 04:02.451
Control Center to Mr. Yip. Over.

04:02.956 --> 04:06.483
<i>Someone called the Computer</i>
<i>Angel is in the lobby...</i>

04:06.960 --> 04:10.862
<i>...claiming to have an appointment</i>
<i>with Chow. Do you receive?</i>

04:34.388 --> 04:39.121
I'm Yip, Chairman Chow's chief of
security. We have to perform a search.

04:45.499 --> 04:48.696
<i>- She doesn't have weapons on her.</i>
- Thank you.

04:49.469 --> 04:50.697
This way, please.

05:01.081 --> 05:06.542
Chairman Chow is waiting upstairs.
Mr. Yip, please go with them.

05:06.753 --> 05:07.742
This way, please.

05:10.757 --> 05:14.853
I'm May, Chairman Chow's secretary.
Sorry about just now.

05:15.095 --> 05:19.930
Mr. Chow rarely receives visitors
nowadays, so our security's a bit tight.

05:35.782 --> 05:37.272
- How are you?
- How do you do?

05:37.818 --> 05:38.978
Please have a seat.

05:41.688 --> 05:46.148
Do you have a name besides
Computer Angel?

05:46.793 --> 05:48.317
Computer Virus!

05:49.563 --> 05:54.398
I'm both Virus and Angel. The invasion
and battle against your computer...

05:54.601 --> 05:56.967
...is my organization's
best optical illusion.

05:57.637 --> 06:01.971
We were simply manipulating
the images on your screens.

06:02.642 --> 06:06.305
None of your data was affected.

06:06.580 --> 06:11.279
The only things we disabled were your
portals and prevention systems.

06:11.651 --> 06:13.744
That's why it looked so realistic.

06:14.488 --> 06:17.582
So much for the opening speech.
What's your point?

06:17.891 --> 06:21.588
You've amassed your fortune through
smuggling and drugs.

06:21.795 --> 06:24.389
It's an evil fortune.

06:25.265 --> 06:28.200
You're impossible to approach
unless it's at your own bidding.

06:28.468 --> 06:29.958
So I've come here to...

07:32.432 --> 07:34.957
It's such a pity that you're so
intelligent.

07:36.603 --> 07:41.040
Even if you had a cannon you
wouldn't be able to touch me.

07:41.975 --> 07:44.136
Why do you think I put the glasses in
there?

07:44.377 --> 07:47.141
That much cyanide would poison
a quarter...

07:47.314 --> 07:48.747
...of the rush-hour subway crowd.

08:52.045 --> 08:55.742
All units, Chairman Chow's in trouble,
check it out! Do you copy?

08:55.949 --> 08:56.938
I copy!

08:59.719 --> 09:01.209
Target destroyed.
I'm leaving the scene.

09:01.621 --> 09:05.580
The police have picked up the alarm.
They'll be there in 5 minutes.

09:05.926 --> 09:08.394
<i>The guards on the 87 th floor are</i>
<i>forming into groups:</i>

09:08.595 --> 09:12.793
<i>Two in the elevator, five by the</i>
<i>stairs, two are at the lobby elevators.</i>

09:13.667 --> 09:15.635
I'm corrupting the screens in
dispatch...

09:15.835 --> 09:17.860
...and cutting off their communication.
Look.

09:19.072 --> 09:21.768
What's happening? What's going on?

09:21.975 --> 09:23.306
Let's listen to a song.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.344
- What's going on?
- What happened?

09:29.583 --> 09:31.073
Why is there music?

09:31.918 --> 09:33.283
Hey, what's going on?

09:53.306 --> 09:56.002
Count to 20 and go down.

09:58.945 --> 10:00.435
One, two, three...

10:17.530 --> 10:19.225
<i>They're about 80 meters from you...</i>

10:19.833 --> 10:21.630
<i>...at 10:00, four men total.</i>

10:22.535 --> 10:24.025
Forty meters...

10:24.404 --> 10:25.393
...30 meters...

10:26.539 --> 10:31.135
...20, 10, 5, here.

10:51.665 --> 10:53.428
- Eight, nine...

10:53.767 --> 10:55.029
May, what's going on?

11:03.777 --> 11:06.075
Now count to 20 and go back up.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.445
<i>Five...</i>

11:17.657 --> 11:22.060
...four, three, two, one. This image
will play in a continuous loop.

11:22.262 --> 11:23.957
You may vacate the premises.

11:29.135 --> 11:31.968
Control Center calling all units.
Target is located.

11:32.172 --> 11:34.572
She's in an elevator in section C.

11:34.774 --> 11:36.935
<i>Wait for her on the 40th floor.</i>

11:37.143 --> 11:40.044
<i>I'll lock the elevator</i>
<i>when it arrives there.</i>

11:40.246 --> 11:41.577
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

11:44.417 --> 11:46.351
Out of the way!

11:51.324 --> 11:52.313
Here!

12:04.037 --> 12:07.302
- No one's there!
- You're joking? Isn't she inside?

12:28.061 --> 12:31.997
Don't forget the cake and candies I
ordered from the Orchid Bakery.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.632
Cut!

12:41.941 --> 12:44.136
Mom and Dad! I'm here again.

12:48.982 --> 12:51.348
I have a complaint.

12:57.023 --> 13:01.084
I'm Sue, I am 8 years old.
Come to Daddy!

13:02.462 --> 13:04.760
Daddy, what are you doing?

13:04.964 --> 13:09.298
Daddy is inventing something that will
change the course of human history.

13:09.969 --> 13:12.836
If it works, it will connect by
satellite...

13:13.106 --> 13:16.803
...all the CCTV systems in every
building in the world...

13:17.277 --> 13:21.805
...and be able to see
what people are doing.

13:22.015 --> 13:25.382
Wow! That's like the eye in the sky.

13:27.053 --> 13:31.490
See, Mom, she always bullied me
and nothing's changed.

13:31.758 --> 13:34.886
<i>Gazing at your boyfriend again?</i>
<i>You're so mushy.</i>

13:35.094 --> 13:39.258
<i>Spit out the gum. You're disgusting!</i>

13:52.579 --> 13:54.274
Do you remember me?

14:04.557 --> 14:07.617
I come back every year to visit my
cousin's grave.

14:07.827 --> 14:10.295
I thought I'd run into you
at the cemetery.

14:11.397 --> 14:14.958
A few years ago you suddenly
disappeared.

14:15.301 --> 14:18.293
I asked lots of people, but no one knew
where you'd gone.

14:19.005 --> 14:21.496
Something happened
to my family that year...

14:21.674 --> 14:23.642
...so my younger sister and I moved.

14:26.846 --> 14:30.304
Are you still working at that American
magazine? Nothing's changed?

14:32.585 --> 14:35.145
Everything's the same with me.
What about you?

14:37.023 --> 14:41.585
All right, I'm going to New York
tomorrow on the noon flight.

14:42.128 --> 14:43.755
Here's my telephone number.

14:45.331 --> 14:48.323
I hope I'll see you again before I go.

15:02.382 --> 15:03.747
What are you thinking about?

15:05.385 --> 15:08.286
The baker must have really upset you.

15:08.788 --> 15:12.918
This job was so clean, what are you
worried about?

15:20.300 --> 15:22.996
- What's the fuzzy thing?
- It's hair.

15:24.003 --> 15:25.493
Is she that tall?

15:26.673 --> 15:28.800
Hey, what are you doing?

15:29.008 --> 15:31.135
- You're asking me?
- Yes.

15:31.477 --> 15:36.005
I'm not tall enough, so I need to climb
up this ladder...

15:36.249 --> 15:37.978
...to inspect the ceiling.

15:38.418 --> 15:42.218
Perhaps a 0.5-inch-diameter hole
between 1.6 and 1.7 inches deep.

15:42.422 --> 15:44.151
This is very interesting.

15:44.357 --> 15:48.293
Why? According to my analysis, it's
very possible that the hole was made...

15:48.494 --> 15:52.089
...by an outstanding pair of pointed
4-and-a-half-inch heeled boots.

15:52.332 --> 15:54.630
The hottest boots on
the Paris catwalks this year.

15:54.834 --> 15:59.271
No one's asking you what it is.
I'm asking you who you are.

16:03.376 --> 16:04.866
Forensics. I'm new.

16:05.078 --> 16:09.481
Oh, a rookie. Go, and come back
when you know a bit more stuff.

16:09.716 --> 16:12.480
No problem, Sergeant Ho Chi-kwong.

16:13.486 --> 16:15.147
How did she know my name?

16:15.788 --> 16:18.086
- What's her background?
- Who knows?

16:18.291 --> 16:20.782
I do. She is Kong Yat-hung.

16:20.994 --> 16:24.930
She used to be with Criminal
Psychology, then trained in the U. S...

16:25.131 --> 16:26.758
...and recently came back
to Hong Kong.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.831
Oh, really? And who are you?

16:29.102 --> 16:34.005
Ma Siu-ma. I was with Traffic, but I did
well, so I was sent to train in Zhuhai.

16:34.173 --> 16:38.166
Now they've transferred me back to be
Kong Yat-hung's assistant.

16:38.511 --> 16:39.705
What are you doing here?

16:40.179 --> 16:43.376
You told her to leave, but didn't tell
me, so I'm still working.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.884
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

16:55.428 --> 16:56.986
Is she crazy?

16:57.196 --> 17:01.155
Don't assume she's a fool.
I'll bet she can run circles around you.

17:03.803 --> 17:06.704
Is she so great? Let me check her out.

17:23.256 --> 17:26.089
She has exactly the same birthday
as you.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.358
No wonder she's so intelligent.

17:28.761 --> 17:30.558
Officer Hung,
I've discovered something.

17:30.763 --> 17:33.561
Security said the killer's face wasn't
recorded on camera.

17:33.766 --> 17:38.897
The guards were all shot in the leg.
This killer is quite something.

17:39.105 --> 17:41.005
This killer is quite something.

17:41.240 --> 17:45.176
You know it's harder to shoot someone
in the leg than shoot him dead?

17:45.411 --> 17:48.938
Those men had no time to fight back.
They said, "Ouch" and passed out.

17:49.148 --> 17:53.107
Why not say, "Argh," and pass out?
Why would they say "Ouch"?

17:53.486 --> 17:57.183
- I'll show you.
- What? Ouch! What're you doing?

17:57.390 --> 17:58.414
That's why.

18:00.927 --> 18:06.058
This song jammed the communication
system. Let's listen to it for clues.

19:19.438 --> 19:20.530
What are you doing?

19:20.740 --> 19:24.699
Even though my cousin lives
in New York, he hates the cold.

19:31.884 --> 19:35.650
<i>I remember that year. I was young</i>
<i>but very happy as a college student.</i>

19:35.955 --> 19:39.118
<i>I went with my best friend May...</i>

19:39.325 --> 19:41.793
<i>...to a remote island for Christmas.</i>

19:42.461 --> 19:44.588
<i>There, I met Yen.</i>

19:45.097 --> 19:48.589
<i>The three of us spent all our time</i>
<i>together.</i>

19:48.801 --> 19:53.431
<i>Yen and I discovered we had feelings</i>
<i>for one another.</i>

19:53.739 --> 19:58.972
<i>But we had an unspoken agreement</i>
<i>not to let May know about it.</i>

19:59.579 --> 20:02.844
<i>So we hid what we were feeling,</i>
<i>all through the holiday.</i>

20:03.649 --> 20:07.483
<i>May made a date with us to get</i>
<i>together again the following year.</i>

20:08.287 --> 20:11.381
<i>But the day before Yen's return...</i>

20:11.591 --> 20:14.492
<i>...she died in a mountaineering</i>
<i>accident.</i>

20:15.127 --> 20:17.925
<i>It was arranged that I pick Yen up.</i>

20:38.317 --> 20:41.377
<i>We'd agreed to meet</i>
<i>at the mortuary...</i>

20:41.887 --> 20:45.345
<i>...but what happened later</i>
<i>changed my life.</i>

20:45.992 --> 20:48.119
<i>I never thought I'd ever see him again.</i>

20:53.299 --> 20:54.323
Come in.

20:56.702 --> 20:59.603
They've transferred the money
into our account.

21:05.177 --> 21:07.839
- What are you doing?
- You know.

21:08.914 --> 21:09.903
No way.

21:11.550 --> 21:15.714
Why can't I handle cases on my own?
Why must I always be the assistant?

21:17.256 --> 21:20.521
Because you're emotional
and reckless. You lack the skills.

21:21.527 --> 21:23.017
Does that answer the question?

21:23.429 --> 21:24.691
I'm not good enough?

21:27.933 --> 21:30.265
I'll get you for that!

22:21.020 --> 22:25.013
The Chow Lui case. The killer is very
accomplished in I.T., no?

22:25.224 --> 22:29.684
He hacks in then destroys the security
system. This kind of killer is rare.

22:29.895 --> 22:31.453
What does the Secret King do?

22:31.697 --> 22:35.030
He was a secret agent. Now he's old,
so he's called the Secret King.

22:35.334 --> 22:39.202
You've been back a month. How did
you know he exists? Even I don't.

22:39.405 --> 22:42.932
It took me a week to get through the
local files for the last 10 years.

22:43.142 --> 22:45.975
A week? Do you remember anything?

24:05.791 --> 24:10.626
- Are you drinking that coffee?
- Can't you see me using the sugar?

24:10.963 --> 24:14.228
You've put the sugar in the cream.
Your coffee is next to it.

24:14.900 --> 24:19.963
I put the sugar in the cream, then I put
it all in the coffee.

24:20.172 --> 24:21.230
Okay?

24:21.674 --> 24:23.665
Are you feeling all right today?

24:24.977 --> 24:27.104
- Enjoying your novel?
- It's okay.

24:27.313 --> 24:30.407
- Shall I tell you the story?
- Sure.

24:31.917 --> 24:35.512
This story is called
"Made for Each Other."

24:35.754 --> 24:39.121
It's about a man meeting a woman
at a pier...

24:40.092 --> 24:41.252
I'm not done yet.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.655
I don't like it. Tell me another.

24:43.863 --> 24:47.264
All right, there's one called
"We'll Meet Again."

24:47.433 --> 24:51.130
- I don't like that one either.
- I haven't started yet.

24:51.370 --> 24:54.567
It's old hat. They obviously have
feelings for each other.

24:54.773 --> 24:58.436
They're separated, then they
meet again at a bakery...

24:59.812 --> 25:01.439
They meet at a nightclub.

25:02.781 --> 25:05.272
That's worse.
The girl's become a prostitute.

25:05.484 --> 25:09.045
Guess what? He became
the prostitute. It's the opposite.

25:09.355 --> 25:13.883
- She was fine.
- Whatever. Anyway, it's all the same.

25:14.093 --> 25:17.722
Okay, I'll tell you the best one:
"Meant for Togetherness."

25:17.997 --> 25:19.259
Okay, tell me.

25:19.498 --> 25:22.058
A guy makes a date with a girl
to meet at the pier.

25:22.268 --> 25:24.031
And then he tells her:

25:24.236 --> 25:27.399
"If you come, it means we're
meant to be together...

25:27.606 --> 25:31.940
...and we'll treasure our relationship
forever." And if she doesn't...

25:35.581 --> 25:36.741
Lynn?

25:43.422 --> 25:47.518
- What are we doing at the airport?
- Looking for someone.

25:47.793 --> 25:51.024
Someone picking someone up
or seeing someone off?

25:51.230 --> 25:54.495
- It's our old neighbor, Uncle Chan.
- Uncle Chan?

25:54.700 --> 25:56.691
You're too young to remember him.

25:56.902 --> 25:59.132
He's leaving, so we're seeing him off.

26:06.378 --> 26:08.209
Lynn!

26:30.169 --> 26:32.160
If you hadn't come today...

26:33.839 --> 26:38.742
...I'd no longer have the excuse to
come back to visit my cousin's grave.

26:45.851 --> 26:47.478
How could I forget you?

26:51.991 --> 26:54.482
This gentleman looks like...

26:55.227 --> 26:58.492
...our old neighbor Uncle Chan.

27:01.533 --> 27:03.797
I'm Yen, and you are?

27:04.570 --> 27:06.401
I'm your fourth great-aunt.

27:06.672 --> 27:08.162
You are telling lies again.

27:12.011 --> 27:17.142
Mr. Chow never told me to invest
$2 billion in Dragon stock.

27:18.017 --> 27:20.577
Isn't it the same talking about it
with me now? If you...

27:20.819 --> 27:24.311
In any case, I don't agree.
Let the board of directors decide.

27:29.228 --> 27:31.560
All the board lacks is your vote.

27:33.032 --> 27:35.523
I definitely won't agree to it.

28:03.529 --> 28:06.726
We managed to do away with your
brother, we can deal with Lai Kai-joe.

28:11.737 --> 28:13.762
Your brother forced us into this.

28:14.973 --> 28:16.941
We helped him conquer the world...

28:17.242 --> 28:20.541
...but as soon as he made his fortune,
he abandoned us.

28:23.582 --> 28:25.379
I don't care.

28:26.051 --> 28:29.987
I'll kill whoever gets in my way.

28:33.425 --> 28:34.551
Mrs. Chow.

28:45.838 --> 28:47.305
What's the matter?

28:47.506 --> 28:48.700
Shit!

28:49.208 --> 28:51.108
The old man Lai refuses to give in.

28:52.177 --> 28:57.012
Ignore him. When the time comes, I'll
transfer all our stock to Dragon.

28:57.216 --> 28:58.843
We'll be even stronger.

28:59.051 --> 29:02.509
And then you can officially...

29:03.188 --> 29:05.122
...become Mrs. Chow again.

29:15.601 --> 29:18.365
Why's the Secret King so late?
Has he stood us up?

29:18.804 --> 29:21.796
The hardest part of being an officer is
the waiting.

29:22.040 --> 29:26.033
Usually I try to bond with my
assistants, and play...

29:26.245 --> 29:28.941
...educational and interesting games of
communication.

29:29.148 --> 29:31.048
What kind of communication?

29:31.250 --> 29:33.047
- You bait me, I bait you.
- You bait...

29:33.252 --> 29:36.380
I ask you something, back and forth.

29:36.588 --> 29:38.283
- We can ask anything?
- Anything goes.

29:38.490 --> 29:40.617
- Okay.
- You go first.

29:40.826 --> 29:43.818
I'll go first. Okay, how many siblings
do you have?

29:44.062 --> 29:46.622
None. At what age did you
begin jerking off?

29:46.832 --> 29:47.890
What?

29:54.439 --> 29:57.897
Fifteen. Do you have a boyfriend?

29:58.110 --> 30:00.772
No. When was the last time you did it?

30:06.585 --> 30:08.348
Yesterday, yesterday.

30:08.554 --> 30:10.351
Yesterday?

30:11.023 --> 30:15.119
You're working today and you
jerked off yesterday? Look!

30:15.561 --> 30:20.191
- Wow, your eyes are really bloodshot.
- Don't ask me questions like that!

30:20.399 --> 30:24.358
- You might ask if I have a girlfriend.
- Lf you had, you wouldn't do that.

30:24.703 --> 30:28.537
- You ever played with yourself?
- Play with myself?

30:29.441 --> 30:31.136
Certainly not!

30:31.443 --> 30:36.244
No? I don't believe it. Do you
think I'm that naive? Nonsense!

30:36.448 --> 30:40.544
Of course it's nonsense.
It's just a game.

30:40.752 --> 30:43.380
Why are you so serious?

30:45.157 --> 30:47.751
Look at you, you're cute
when you're stupid.

30:52.898 --> 30:54.058
Why are you so secretive?

30:54.266 --> 30:56.962
The older I grow,
the more secretive I am.

30:57.169 --> 31:01.765
Hung, none of my colleagues know
who made the hit you talked about.

31:01.974 --> 31:06.502
Someone who specializes in selling
high-tech goods says 15 years ago...

31:06.812 --> 31:10.373
...someone bought a lot of satellite
equipment from him.

31:10.582 --> 31:14.245
But the buyer was a middle-aged man,
not a woman, like you said.

31:14.486 --> 31:16.044
Turn off the walkie-talkie.

31:16.722 --> 31:18.019
I didn't turn it on.

31:21.526 --> 31:25.895
- How do you think I gather info?
- You gather from our headquarters?

31:26.098 --> 31:29.261
Where in the world would we be
without secrets?

31:30.168 --> 31:31.897
Get out. Drive.

31:33.338 --> 31:35.272
Hey, hey, hey.

31:37.576 --> 31:42.104
Did you have to go so fast?
You trying to kill me?

31:42.581 --> 31:46.517
The Secret King reminded me. We're
concerned with finding the murderer.

31:46.718 --> 31:49.846
But it's impossible.
The security is so tight there.

31:50.155 --> 31:53.090
But the Computer Angel comes
and goes as she pleases...

31:53.292 --> 31:56.921
...shoots the guards and none
of the CCTV capture her face.

31:57.095 --> 31:59.723
Do you think it's an inside job?

31:59.965 --> 32:02.798
The head of security said
all their computer data...

32:03.001 --> 32:06.095
...is accessible only if Chow Lui's
fingerprints...

32:06.305 --> 32:10.173
...were placed on the scanner
and correctly identified.

32:10.409 --> 32:14.971
But Chow Lui is dead, in the mortuary.
So how does access happen now?

32:15.614 --> 32:19.209
That's why I have to prove that my
theory is correct.

32:20.352 --> 32:24.015
The penthouse was Chow's personal
space, so it's not covered by cameras.

32:24.256 --> 32:27.623
All of Mr. Chow's visitors would have
had to take this elevator up.

32:27.826 --> 32:30.954
- Who was first on the scene?
- His younger brother.

32:32.464 --> 32:34.557
I need to use the restroom.
Where is it?

32:34.733 --> 32:37.600
- Over there.
- Women are so much trouble.

32:43.208 --> 32:47.542
Hello, does a Choy Siu-ming
work here?

32:49.614 --> 32:50.945
Yes. What is it, please?

32:51.383 --> 32:54.443
<i>- Mr. Choy, phone home urgently.</i>
- What?

32:55.020 --> 32:57.682
<i>- Something happened to your family.</i>
- Okay.

32:57.856 --> 33:00.120
- What's up?
- Something's happened to my family.

33:00.292 --> 33:03.853
- Is it serious? Go, if it's urgent.
- Don't walk off by yourselves.

33:04.029 --> 33:05.621
Don't worry. We'll wait here.

33:05.797 --> 33:09.858
- Remember don't go off by yourselves.
- Don't worry, I won't.

33:13.739 --> 33:16.606
Hung, he's gone, come out.

33:23.982 --> 33:25.347
What's on your mind?

33:25.517 --> 33:28.145
I wonder if anyone changed
the data that day.

33:30.022 --> 33:32.786
Ridiculous! I wonder who would make
such a terrible crank call.

33:32.958 --> 33:35.017
Just wait till I find out.

33:39.197 --> 33:42.030
- Mr. Chow, Mr. Yeung.
- You're still here at this hour?

33:42.200 --> 33:45.533
Officers are investigating the case.
They're in Chairman Chow's room.

33:47.005 --> 33:50.702
You stole Chow Lui's fingerprints
from the coroner's laboratory?

33:51.743 --> 33:55.440
This will very soon prove
whether my theory is correct.

33:55.781 --> 34:00.741
Sorry, Mr. Chow. I was
with them originally, but...

34:04.589 --> 34:05.817
It's true! Who made the changes?

34:06.792 --> 34:10.319
- Who was first on the scene?
- His brother, Chow Nunn.

34:10.495 --> 34:13.953
- Who stands to gain from his death?
- Chow Nunn.

34:44.296 --> 34:47.857
- Officers, where were you?
- We've been looking for you.

34:48.033 --> 34:49.728
- This place is so big.
- These are the officers.

34:49.901 --> 34:50.993
What are you looking for?

34:51.636 --> 34:54.867
Nothing in particular.
It's standard procedure. We're done.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.134
See them out.

35:04.816 --> 35:08.308
It seems the policewoman
is on to something.

35:08.487 --> 35:12.082
If she finds any evidence of the killer,
we're in deep trouble.

35:12.257 --> 35:13.986
When the Angel finishes off
Lai Kai-joe...

35:14.159 --> 35:16.320
...we'll send the Angel herself
to heaven.

35:16.695 --> 35:18.856
Tell the Angel we need her
for another job.

35:47.058 --> 35:50.824
- Come in.
- On the phone with Uncle Chan again?

35:50.996 --> 35:52.588
- What is it?
- Business.

35:56.034 --> 35:58.093
People with sweethearts are selfish.

35:58.370 --> 36:00.304
Go away!

36:15.053 --> 36:16.418
Did you find anything?

36:17.422 --> 36:20.789
I've checked the company's
outgoing e-mail...

36:20.959 --> 36:24.725
...and pulled all the suspicious
messages. Here, take a look.

36:34.072 --> 36:39.032
- Wait! Find out the recipient's address.
- What?

36:39.444 --> 36:41.435
- I can't help you.
- You're kidding.

36:41.980 --> 36:44.972
Should we report this
to our superiors?

36:45.150 --> 36:50.019
What kind of e-mail is that?
What does kissing ass prove?

36:50.188 --> 36:54.147
On what basis can our superiors
take action? Intuition?

36:54.326 --> 36:56.385
- Take me to a record store.
- Why?

36:56.561 --> 36:58.756
Remember Security said
the communication system...

36:58.930 --> 37:00.488
...was interrupted by a song?

37:00.665 --> 37:01.927
And what if you find it?

37:02.100 --> 37:04.568
I can't let any clue
related to this case slip by.

39:08.593 --> 39:11.892
I spoke to my mother about you
on the phone yesterday.

39:12.097 --> 39:15.191
She asked me what you do.
I couldn't answer her.

39:19.437 --> 39:22.235
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

39:24.909 --> 39:26.706
It's not that I don't want to say.

39:26.945 --> 39:29.641
My job isn't easy to understand
or accept for normal people.

39:39.457 --> 39:41.288
This is a robbery. Don't move.

39:43.061 --> 39:45.586
Take out your things. Hurry, quickly.

39:59.611 --> 40:01.738
- No, don't!
- Get out!

40:08.920 --> 40:10.854
Now you know what I do.

40:50.562 --> 40:51.893
Wait for me.

42:34.532 --> 42:38.024
I've studied the terrain. I've even
picked the tools for you.

42:38.236 --> 42:39.635
This rifle is perfect.

42:40.204 --> 42:42.229
I want to cancel that contract.

42:42.874 --> 42:43.863
What?

42:45.910 --> 42:48.902
I think we should call it quits.

42:53.685 --> 42:55.812
Do I get an explanation?

42:59.657 --> 43:04.287
He's asked me to marry him,
so I don't want to do it anymore.

43:09.033 --> 43:11.092
You told him about us?

43:20.445 --> 43:21.503
Congratulations.

43:24.682 --> 43:27.947
Get some rest, I'll cancel the contract.

43:30.555 --> 43:32.489
Then you get some rest too.

44:16.834 --> 44:18.096
Sue?

44:23.708 --> 44:24.868
Sue?

44:26.978 --> 44:28.104
Sue?

44:37.121 --> 44:38.452
Stick them up!

44:38.656 --> 44:42.353
You frightened me!
I'm listening to my new CD.

44:43.127 --> 44:44.685
I'm going out to dinner.

44:44.962 --> 44:48.125
Okay. Go, before Uncle Chan
gets desperate from waiting.

45:39.517 --> 45:41.849
Lawyer Chan, enjoy yourself tonight!

45:42.053 --> 45:44.783
It's the boss's birthday.
I'm getting completely drunk.

45:45.289 --> 45:49.658
It's your birthday tomorrow. I've
reserved a table for lunch at Rosario's.

45:49.861 --> 45:52.352
I've heard they do great French food.

45:54.532 --> 45:55.726
What is it?

45:58.002 --> 45:59.230
What are you thinking about?

46:00.638 --> 46:03.630
She hasn't called me all day.
It's not like her.

46:03.841 --> 46:06.605
- Who?
- My sister.

46:07.645 --> 46:09.237
I'll just call her.

46:19.791 --> 46:22.589
- No answer.
- Maybe she's in the bathroom?

46:25.830 --> 46:27.092
I'll call later.

46:28.599 --> 46:29.657
Cheers.

46:35.940 --> 46:37.669
Happy birthday!

46:38.509 --> 46:40.033
Boss, how's the stock doing?

46:40.278 --> 46:43.441
Going up. Buy from me
and you won't have a problem.

46:54.525 --> 46:58.427
I looked into Lai's room.
Those three girls are clean.

46:58.629 --> 47:00.062
Still no answer?

47:02.133 --> 47:03.327
Let me see.

47:23.321 --> 47:25.312
No wonder she's not picking up.

47:31.262 --> 47:32.524
These?

47:33.064 --> 47:35.089
I have something to do. I must go.

47:35.766 --> 47:37.893
Remember our date
for lunch tomorrow.

47:39.670 --> 47:40.659
Lynn!

48:06.197 --> 48:07.630
Why are the lights doing that?

48:07.832 --> 48:11.290
The light show starts at 10
and repeats on the hour.

48:11.502 --> 48:14.494
We're the only place in Hong Kong
with this design.

48:15.539 --> 48:16.972
Miss, do you need anything?

48:17.174 --> 48:20.701
I'll wait to order when my friends
arrive. Please go outside...

48:20.912 --> 48:23.142
...and close the door for me.
- Okay.

48:24.715 --> 48:26.148
There's something wrong.

48:26.350 --> 48:29.080
- What is it?
- I feel she's here tonight.

48:57.682 --> 49:00.549
Boss, the policewoman from last time
is here.

49:04.288 --> 49:06.916
<i>In that case, we'll take care of her</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

49:10.027 --> 49:13.724
Are your instincts right?
Will they show up?

49:22.373 --> 49:23.738
Shit!

49:24.442 --> 49:26.137
She's across the street!

49:34.552 --> 49:36.315
Let's go check it out.

50:07.952 --> 50:08.941
Let me do it.

50:15.292 --> 50:17.954
We're the police. Which room
faces the Magic Ocean Disco?

50:18.162 --> 50:21.154
Room 17, but two ladies
are already in it.

50:21.365 --> 50:22.354
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

50:58.069 --> 50:59.468
Don't hold the elevator for me.

51:26.730 --> 51:27.856
Excuse me.

52:17.414 --> 52:20.645
It's pointless for you to hold on
to him. I still have your partner.

52:21.485 --> 52:25.387
I didn't plan to bring her with me.
They think they're better than they are.

52:25.589 --> 52:28.422
Even if she didn't die today,
she'd be useless tomorrow.

52:31.395 --> 52:35.229
Okay. I'll release her
and you release my man.

55:53.897 --> 55:55.660
Careful!

56:12.516 --> 56:14.347
Lynn! You can go now. I'm here.

56:14.718 --> 56:17.846
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Throw me the gun!

56:32.736 --> 56:33.964
Siu-ma!

56:45.549 --> 56:46.811
Sue!

57:42.105 --> 57:43.436
Siu-ma!

58:14.471 --> 58:15.904
Get out when we get to the road.

58:51.208 --> 58:54.666
The people we did that last hit for
want to kill us now...

58:54.878 --> 58:57.676
...so they set a trap for us.

58:59.650 --> 59:01.242
Listen carefully.

59:01.685 --> 59:05.883
He just wants to protect himself
and his money.

59:06.089 --> 59:09.490
Just like we work as killers,
it's only for money...

59:09.693 --> 59:11.593
...and not love or hate.

59:13.931 --> 59:15.831
I'll kill them all tomorrow.

59:16.033 --> 59:19.901
If you do, it will be because you want
revenge. You can't do it.

59:20.103 --> 59:21.229
Why not?

59:23.006 --> 59:26.737
If you were capable, you would've hit
the target with one shot...

59:26.944 --> 59:29.742
...and you wouldn't have been found
by the police.

59:29.947 --> 59:31.915
You'd never have gotten away
without my help.

59:34.651 --> 59:36.676
When did you learn
to make up your own mind?

59:36.887 --> 59:38.946
Why didn't you cancel the contract
when I told you to?

59:41.959 --> 59:45.451
And when did you start making
all the decisions?

59:46.964 --> 59:50.900
You said you wanted to get married
and quit.

59:52.235 --> 59:53.702
Did I put up a fight?

59:56.974 --> 59:58.669
You may cancel your half
of the contract.

59:59.676 --> 1:00:00.870
What did you say?

1:00:09.319 --> 1:00:12.516
I know I can't beat you in a fight.

1:00:13.490 --> 1:00:16.459
But no one can force me to do
what I don't want to do.

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:20.824
I didn't force you. I only want you
to live a normal life.

1:00:29.306 --> 1:00:32.969
Not every woman needs a man
to protect her like you do!

1:02:40.270 --> 1:02:41.328
<i>Hello?</i>

1:02:43.373 --> 1:02:45.398
How did you know we had a fight?

1:02:47.277 --> 1:02:51.873
I could tell how you were feeling,
even on the computer.

1:02:52.616 --> 1:02:53.605
What happened?

1:02:55.952 --> 1:02:58.284
Do you believe in reaping
what you sow?

1:02:59.356 --> 1:03:00.516
What do you mean?

1:03:02.759 --> 1:03:04.090
For years...

1:03:05.295 --> 1:03:08.696
...I've had the smell of blood
on my hands.

1:03:09.299 --> 1:03:13.292
No matter how much I wash them,
the smell won't go away...

1:03:15.205 --> 1:03:17.469
...because the blood of my victims...

1:03:18.375 --> 1:03:22.436
...not only stained my hands,
it also flowed into my heart.

1:03:26.650 --> 1:03:29.118
That's why I never let Sue do a job.

1:03:31.388 --> 1:03:35.654
<i>I don't want her to be like me, to have</i>
<i>to suffer this guilt all her life.</i>

1:03:40.096 --> 1:03:42.428
<i>I'll never forget it as long as I live.</i>

1:03:42.666 --> 1:03:46.693
<i>My dad's invention, World</i>
<i>Panorama, was nearing completion.</i>

1:03:47.404 --> 1:03:50.498
<i>Originally, he had planned...</i>

1:03:51.441 --> 1:03:54.433
<i>...to give his invention to the police...</i>

1:03:55.378 --> 1:03:57.437
<i>...but a group of ruthless</i>
<i>businessmen...</i>

1:04:02.419 --> 1:04:04.353
<i>...murdered my parents for it first.</i>

1:04:09.526 --> 1:04:13.189
<i>One of the killers rescued</i>
<i>my sister and me.</i>

1:04:15.031 --> 1:04:18.990
<i>It was he who taught me</i>
<i>to fire my first shot.</i>

1:04:54.838 --> 1:04:58.171
I know where the Computer Angel is.

1:05:00.777 --> 1:05:05.544
You're not with Operations. I'll forget
the Secret King case as it ended okay.

1:05:05.782 --> 1:05:08.842
But your latest actions hospitalized
your partner.

1:05:09.052 --> 1:05:10.610
I almost captured the Computer Angel.

1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:13.516
How can you joke? The place
was shot up like a honeycomb.

1:05:13.723 --> 1:05:16.783
Do you know how much in reparation
we paid? Think about it!

1:05:42.452 --> 1:05:45.979
Mr. Chow, we've made all the
arrangements for the policewoman.

1:05:46.990 --> 1:05:50.517
This is Peter, a computer expert
we hired from America.

1:05:50.994 --> 1:05:54.361
This is Ben. He'll be in charge
of our security.

1:05:55.532 --> 1:05:58.968
Interesting.
Are you a chess aficionado?

1:06:00.303 --> 1:06:03.204
- Are you up for a match?
- Absolutely!

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:05.098
Please.

1:06:52.622 --> 1:06:53.611
Good morning.

1:06:56.292 --> 1:06:57.316
Good morning.

1:06:58.962 --> 1:07:00.122
Good morning.

1:07:14.144 --> 1:07:16.578
Hey, you're a year older.

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:18.680
- What?
- Happy birthday!

1:07:18.882 --> 1:07:22.374
- How did you know?
- Someone sent you a birthday cake.

1:07:22.619 --> 1:07:26.953
Looks like your boyfriend wanted to
surprise you. It's on your desk.

1:07:41.538 --> 1:07:42.562
Hello?

1:07:42.772 --> 1:07:46.731
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:07:47.043 --> 1:07:50.206
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:07:52.382 --> 1:07:55.317
<i>Well? Do you like the cake?</i>

1:08:02.258 --> 1:08:05.125
You're so clever!
You know I'm watching you.

1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:26.446
Why are you so angry?

1:08:33.256 --> 1:08:35.884
Doesn't the cake taste great?

1:09:07.957 --> 1:09:10.687
<i>Sorry, Lynn.</i>

1:09:20.970 --> 1:09:24.133
Mom, do I still have to jump?

1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:28.276
If you disobey your elder sister again,
you'll jump until dawn, understand?

1:09:36.653 --> 1:09:40.111
- Is the cake I ordered ready yet?
- It's ready.

1:09:40.323 --> 1:09:41.449
There you go.

1:09:42.325 --> 1:09:43.314
Thank you!

1:09:47.497 --> 1:09:50.660
- Hello?
<i>- Well? Do you know who I am?</i>

1:09:51.834 --> 1:09:54.268
<i>What? Are you afraid?</i>

1:09:57.941 --> 1:09:59.738
How did you get my number?

1:09:59.943 --> 1:10:03.106
<i>You're a regular customer here.</i>
<i>It was easy to find out.</i>

1:10:03.313 --> 1:10:07.079
<i>You're very clever. You put the cake</i>
<i>in a plain white box.</i>

1:10:07.283 --> 1:10:11.515
<i>But as soon as I tasted it, I knew it</i>
<i>came from the Orchid Bakery.</i>

1:10:11.754 --> 1:10:16.282
<i>You're not the only one who</i>
<i>appreciates great cake. Look outside.</i>

1:10:48.324 --> 1:10:49.450
My car!

1:10:52.829 --> 1:10:56.094
- Police! Stop.
- To hell with that!

1:10:59.569 --> 1:11:00.797
You! Get out!

1:11:16.219 --> 1:11:20.815
I'm WIP3662 Kong Yat-hung, following
a suspect on Causeway Road.

1:11:21.024 --> 1:11:24.721
License plate number
Juliet Victor 955. Requesting backup!

1:11:25.395 --> 1:11:29.957
<i>This is HQ. A suspect's been spotted.</i>
<i>License plate Juliet Victor 955.</i>

1:11:30.533 --> 1:11:32.364
<i>Car 1 copy.</i>

1:12:21.751 --> 1:12:22.740
Hello?

1:12:22.952 --> 1:12:25.113
- Hurry and help me!
<i>- What's happening?</i>

1:12:25.355 --> 1:12:27.585
I'm being chased by patrol cars!

1:12:27.957 --> 1:12:32.326
- What's your location?
- Tung Lo Wan and Causeway Road.

1:12:32.595 --> 1:12:33.653
Hold on.

1:12:46.142 --> 1:12:48.269
- Lynn, hurry!
- Wait.

1:12:56.652 --> 1:12:58.711
- Have you found me?
- I'm trying.

1:13:00.857 --> 1:13:03.325
- Got you!
- So where do I go?

1:13:03.659 --> 1:13:07.390
There are alleyways where you can
escape. Get off the bridge first.

1:13:23.479 --> 1:13:25.743
I can't hear you clearly. Speak louder!

1:13:30.686 --> 1:13:33.951
- Police have blocked the road.
- What should I do?

1:13:37.994 --> 1:13:39.985
There's an exit on your left.

1:13:46.736 --> 1:13:48.533
- I can't see it!
- You're 400 meters away.

1:13:50.006 --> 1:13:50.995
<i>3</i>50 meters...

1:13:52.041 --> 1:13:53.303
...200...

1:13:56.245 --> 1:13:58.611
...100, 50...

1:14:00.817 --> 1:14:01.943
...turn!

1:14:20.870 --> 1:14:22.599
Thirty, turn!

1:15:11.587 --> 1:15:13.020
<i>Lynn!</i>

1:15:28.304 --> 1:15:30.204
<i>Help me, Lynn!</i>

1:15:41.384 --> 1:15:42.817
<i>Got you.</i>

1:15:49.258 --> 1:15:51.055
What do I do now?

1:16:02.271 --> 1:16:04.398
Reverse. There's an exit behind you.

1:16:07.910 --> 1:16:09.468
Crash through the two police cars.

1:16:16.986 --> 1:16:18.317
Crash through!

1:16:26.829 --> 1:16:28.763
Sue!

1:16:58.594 --> 1:16:59.618
Lynn!

1:17:17.079 --> 1:17:18.239
Lynn!

1:17:24.954 --> 1:17:26.182
Lynn!

1:19:07.423 --> 1:19:09.186
Sue!

1:20:59.401 --> 1:21:00.959
<i>Sue.</i>

1:21:27.129 --> 1:21:32.533
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I forgot you're a big girl now.</i>

1:21:32.701 --> 1:21:35.966
<i>I remember when we were little, every</i>
<i>time we did something wrong...</i>

1:21:36.138 --> 1:21:38.265
<i>...Mommy only pretended to be angry.</i>

1:21:40.776 --> 1:21:42.710
<i>No matter what you've done now...</i>

1:21:43.112 --> 1:21:45.910
<i>...I won't blame you, just as Mommy</i>
<i>never blamed us.</i>

1:21:49.451 --> 1:21:51.885
<i>You're looking</i>
<i>at your boyfriend again?</i>

1:21:52.087 --> 1:21:57.024
<i>- Stop it!</i>
<i>- Leave me alone! You're overacting!</i>

1:21:57.226 --> 1:21:59.353
<i>- Overacting?</i>
<i>- Give it back!</i>

1:22:00.663 --> 1:22:03.223
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
<i>- Come and get it!</i>

1:22:03.432 --> 1:22:05.423
<i>- Come and get it!</i>
<i>- Give it to me.</i>

1:22:57.953 --> 1:22:59.147
Have you seen this person?

1:23:02.124 --> 1:23:03.614
She was murdered today.

1:23:03.792 --> 1:23:07.091
Much of the evidence at the scene
of the crime points to you.

1:23:07.262 --> 1:23:08.251
Impossible.

1:23:23.245 --> 1:23:26.214
You've been framed. I know who did it.

1:23:26.949 --> 1:23:31.716
You'll be dead if you stay here. The
only way to survive is to come with me.

1:23:31.954 --> 1:23:33.785
You speak as if I have no choice.

1:23:34.456 --> 1:23:35.923
You have two choices:

1:23:36.158 --> 1:23:40.925
A: We leave together. B: I kill you,
then I leave.

1:23:42.398 --> 1:23:46.164
You know what? There's at least one
more letter in the English alphabet.

1:23:46.402 --> 1:23:48.302
Besides A and B, there's C behind me.

1:23:57.312 --> 1:23:59.542
Anti-Corruption came to see me today.

1:23:59.782 --> 1:24:04.378
A deposit was recently made into your
bank account. But I don't believe them.

1:24:07.990 --> 1:24:09.981
Now only you can help yourself.

1:24:15.497 --> 1:24:18.398
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

1:24:31.413 --> 1:24:33.745
If you help me avenge
my sister's death...

1:24:33.982 --> 1:24:37.213
...I'll give you the recording of her
murder and cooperate with you.

1:24:37.419 --> 1:24:40.684
Why are you so sure
I'll cooperate with you?

1:24:41.223 --> 1:24:42.349
I understand you.

1:24:43.659 --> 1:24:44.648
Really?

1:24:45.894 --> 1:24:49.557
We're opposites, but I think you're
somehow attracted to me.

1:24:52.601 --> 1:24:55.161
What is it? Are you regretting this?

1:24:55.637 --> 1:24:59.266
Let me be clear.
I won't help you kill anyone.

1:24:59.475 --> 1:25:02.808
- I'll only help you work the computer.
- That's all I need.

1:25:04.046 --> 1:25:07.015
We definitely can't let
the two of them go.

1:25:07.516 --> 1:25:11.919
As long as they are alive, I will not
sleep. Do you understand me?!

1:25:12.154 --> 1:25:15.385
I understand. We've enhanced
the security system.

1:25:15.591 --> 1:25:20.551
You should go away for a bit. When
we take care of them, you come back.

1:25:24.066 --> 1:25:27.524
Sometimes the most dangerous place
turns out to be the safest.

1:25:28.237 --> 1:25:30.569
To catch a small fish
in a large ocean...

1:25:30.772 --> 1:25:34.833
...I think you might as well wait
and let it swim into your net.

1:25:36.245 --> 1:25:39.840
That's exactly what I think.

1:26:19.221 --> 1:26:20.586
This is incredible.

1:26:21.423 --> 1:26:24.187
Your sister used this to rescue you
that last time?

1:26:25.027 --> 1:26:27.587
This computer directly controls
the World Panorama.

1:26:27.829 --> 1:26:29.558
I've installed new software.

1:26:29.765 --> 1:26:32.359
You'll have to know it thoroughly
before tomorrow.

1:26:37.940 --> 1:26:39.237
Boyfriend?

1:26:40.609 --> 1:26:42.201
What boyfriend?

1:26:43.779 --> 1:26:44.837
Him.

1:26:47.449 --> 1:26:52.443
He's not bad, but he's too passive. I
like men to be a bit more aggressive.

1:26:54.223 --> 1:26:56.020
I have a question for you:

1:26:57.359 --> 1:27:01.386
If I was a police officer
rather than an assassin...

1:27:02.864 --> 1:27:04.388
...would you choose him, or me?

1:27:09.638 --> 1:27:11.367
Never mind.

1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.599
Actually, I didn't need to ask.

1:27:15.410 --> 1:27:19.039
When you were dreaming yesterday,
you already said it.

1:27:20.249 --> 1:27:23.047
You're a soldier, and I'm a bandit.

1:27:41.036 --> 1:27:42.799
Hey.

1:27:43.739 --> 1:27:44.728
Be careful.

1:27:53.715 --> 1:27:55.910
<i>Section A, B, C and D elevators</i>
<i>will be on the 87 th floor.</i>

1:27:56.118 --> 1:27:59.246
<i>Only Elevator 1 in section A will work</i>
<i>in the lobby. Do you copy?</i>

1:27:59.521 --> 1:28:00.510
Copy that.

1:28:34.890 --> 1:28:36.619
<i>Operations are normal upstairs.</i>

1:28:37.592 --> 1:28:39.116
You must all be careful, okay?

1:28:54.743 --> 1:28:57.735
Everything's set. It's up to you now.

1:28:58.347 --> 1:29:02.579
I know you don't really trust me, but in
helping you, I'm helping myself.

1:29:04.052 --> 1:29:07.215
<i>A man like Chow Nunn isn't worth</i>
<i>protecting with the law.</i>

1:29:08.590 --> 1:29:11.218
I had another dream yesterday.

1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:13.452
I didn't arrest you.

1:29:15.897 --> 1:29:19.128
- Let's get to work, Hung!
- Take care of yourself, Sue.

1:29:38.887 --> 1:29:40.514
The fish has taken the bait.

1:29:40.689 --> 1:29:42.054
Mr. Chow...

1:29:42.257 --> 1:29:46.091
...this is DG 747. Anti-hacking system.

1:29:46.361 --> 1:29:50.195
Five minutes is all this baby and I
need to locate the trespasser...

1:29:50.365 --> 1:29:52.526
...strike back and wipe it out.

1:30:03.845 --> 1:30:04.834
Got you!

1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:08.311
The target is in section C.
Get the elevator up now!

1:30:09.217 --> 1:30:10.241
There's trouble in section C.

1:30:20.729 --> 1:30:21.957
Why is she in block A?

1:30:24.433 --> 1:30:26.060
- What's going on?
<i>- Where is she now?</i>

1:30:26.268 --> 1:30:29.203
Send some men down there.
The others stay upstairs.

1:30:30.705 --> 1:30:32.434
<i>Copy. Somebody's over there.</i>

1:31:42.844 --> 1:31:44.812
- What happened?
- Don't worry, we'll handle it.

1:31:46.648 --> 1:31:48.047
Are you all right?

1:31:49.451 --> 1:31:50.645
I'm okay.

1:31:50.819 --> 1:31:53.185
Tell me when you get there.
I'll input more virtual people.

1:31:53.388 --> 1:31:55.822
Their men are concentrated
on floors 89, 88 and 87.

1:31:56.558 --> 1:31:59.186
<i>Be careful. We can't afford</i>
<i>to lose this time!</i>

1:32:04.499 --> 1:32:05.488
Doctor?

1:32:05.834 --> 1:32:07.699
The target is in section A,
going towards B.

1:32:11.273 --> 1:32:12.399
Careful! She's now behind you!

1:32:15.610 --> 1:32:16.941
No, she's not!

1:32:43.371 --> 1:32:46.602
Gotcha! Wonderful!
Simulated images.

1:32:47.075 --> 1:32:49.236
Almost the worthy adversary.

1:32:51.546 --> 1:32:52.911
But not good enough.

1:33:01.256 --> 1:33:04.783
Gentlemen, now is where
we get to play with her.

1:33:05.093 --> 1:33:08.551
Tell the men on 88 to go down
to the fire escape in section A.

1:33:13.368 --> 1:33:14.767
Why did the virtual people disappear?

1:33:15.303 --> 1:33:17.032
Three.

1:33:17.639 --> 1:33:19.072
Two.

1:33:20.875 --> 1:33:23.639
One. Done.

1:33:27.349 --> 1:33:28.907
Where do I go now?

1:33:33.121 --> 1:33:35.715
Leave section A.
Go to the fire escape of section B.

1:33:56.578 --> 1:33:58.705
What happened? Why did it do that?

1:33:59.314 --> 1:34:02.249
Don't ask me! I was ambushed.
Why'd you let me go there?

1:34:06.021 --> 1:34:07.010
Anyone in section C?

1:34:08.623 --> 1:34:09.988
I guess it's no problem.

1:34:12.327 --> 1:34:14.124
Well done!

1:34:24.339 --> 1:34:26.364
You bitch! How dare you mislead me!
Well?

1:34:26.574 --> 1:34:29.771
I didn't. I really didn't see there were
people there. Believe me.

1:34:30.011 --> 1:34:33.208
I'd rather trust myself than you. I'll
get back at you, even in death.

1:34:33.415 --> 1:34:36.043
- Are you threatening me?
- I won't speak to scum like you.

1:34:36.317 --> 1:34:39.013
Scum? Hello? All right!

1:34:39.354 --> 1:34:42.152
I'm coming after you.
I'm coming right now.

1:41:09.577 --> 1:41:11.477
Sue! Sue!

1:44:45.026 --> 1:44:48.792
I've destroyed all the computers.
Why is there an image here?

1:44:54.168 --> 1:44:57.262
It's a shot from World Panorama.

1:44:57.872 --> 1:45:00.534
It's Lynn, blessing us from heaven!

1:45:01.842 --> 1:45:04.174
She's blessing you, not blessing me.

1:45:08.883 --> 1:45:11.579
This contains a record
of Lynn's murder.

1:45:12.053 --> 1:45:14.180
It should be enough
to clear your name.

1:45:17.992 --> 1:45:19.687
Also...

1:45:20.194 --> 1:45:23.391
...your dream is the opposite of reality.

1:45:24.699 --> 1:45:27.964
I can come with you,
since I should pay for my sins.

1:45:30.705 --> 1:45:32.502
The Computer Angel has died...

1:45:32.707 --> 1:45:35.403
...and will never commit
any more crimes, right?

1:45:38.079 --> 1:45:40.411
Actually, you are really talented.

1:45:40.981 --> 1:45:43.506
I hope you'll do something for society.

1:45:44.585 --> 1:45:46.917
I am not that ambitious.

1:45:49.256 --> 1:45:53.852
But I can give my father's
World Panorama to you.

1:45:54.462 --> 1:45:58.728
It will be very useful to you.
Actually, this was my father's wish.

1:46:03.871 --> 1:46:04.860
Goodbye.

1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:42.737
<i>When she left, she made me think</i>
<i>of a line spoken by a killer:</i>

1:46:43.146 --> 1:46:45.910
<i>"A gun is like a bird.</i>

1:46:46.349 --> 1:46:49.250
<i>If you don't grab it tightly enough,</i>
<i>it flies away.</i>

1:46:49.552 --> 1:46:52.851
<i>If you grab it too tightly,</i>
<i>it will die. "</i>

1:46:53.890 --> 1:46:56.916
<i>This metaphor applies even more</i>
<i>to my relationship with Sue...</i>

1:46:57.126 --> 1:47:00.459
<i>...a friendship between soldier</i>
<i>and bandit.</i>

1:47:15.676 --> 1:47:17.871
Mom, Dad...

1:47:19.713 --> 1:47:22.511
...I have already brought Lynn
to your side.

1:47:24.485 --> 1:47:25.884
Lynn...

1:47:27.188 --> 1:47:28.780
...after this incident...

1:47:29.990 --> 1:47:32.322
...I will never disobey you again.

1:47:33.994 --> 1:47:36.895
I can now take care of myself.

1:47:39.533 --> 1:47:42.900
I am most worried about...

1:47:44.405 --> 1:47:48.341
<i>...how to tell Yen what has happened.</i>

1:47:50.211 --> 1:47:52.645
<i>The most painful thing for a man</i>
<i>is to be stood up.</i>

1:47:53.147 --> 1:47:55.945
<i>I will tell him he will always be</i>
<i>your beloved.</i>
