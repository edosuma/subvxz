WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.661
Rygel:
Pilot, blast us out of here.

00:04.797 --> 00:07.004
Agreed. We may be in
danger, too.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.545
But there may be survivors.
Someone still aboard.

00:09.677 --> 00:14.296
We'll drink to honor their
memories later but we
leave here now.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.263
DO we have a COHSGHSUS?

00:16.392 --> 00:17.632
-Reverse course.
-Closer.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.099
Leave here now.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.093
Is there a problem?

00:21.230 --> 00:22.265
Damn.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.013
Who does that belong to?

00:24.150 --> 00:25.890
Rygel:
Don't know, don't care.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.143
It's subatomically
disintegrating, John.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.894
No idea what's causing it.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.319
D'Argo:
Reason enough to stay clear.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.317
What is that?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.208
Attention!

00:41.334 --> 00:43.325
Transmission coming in.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.875
Please... help us.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.999
Power's malfunctioning.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.672
Life support... gone.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.056
Pilot...

00:56.182 --> 00:57.513
bring that ship aboard.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.052
But you said yourself
we may be...

00:59.185 --> 01:01.392
Do it.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.101
Zhaan:
We have our consensus, Pilot.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.220
Deploy the docking web.

01:04.357 --> 01:06.393
Deploying the web.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.186
Hurry up, Crichton.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.207
Their ship's in trouble.
Come on.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.178
I got you. Hang on.
Come on, hang on.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.359
I'm going to check the
shuttle for others.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.340
Crichton. There's no
one else aboard.

02:18.472 --> 02:23.717
( echoing ):
There's no one else aboard.

02:27.273 --> 02:30.390
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.864
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

02:38.993 --> 02:41.905
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

02:42.038 --> 02:44.404
Mow I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

02:44.540 --> 02:46.121
on a ship-- a living ship

02:46.250 --> 02:48.332
full of strange alien
life-forms...

02:48.461 --> 02:49.200
Help me, help me...

02:49.337 --> 02:50.702
Listen, please.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.920
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

02:53.049 --> 02:57.088
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

02:57.219 --> 02:59.255
...doing everything I can...

02:59.388 --> 03:02.004
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.739
We must be able to do something.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.451
There may be others
on that cruiser.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.381
Not anymore.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.126
(chuckling)

03:43.140 --> 03:46.883
We weren't even aware that
was a malfunction

03:47.019 --> 03:49.305
until the phase couplers
ovenoaded.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.180
By then, all we could do
was evacuate.

03:52.316 --> 03:56.104
Fortunately, Matala and l
were the only crew.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.647
Are you hurt?

03:57.780 --> 04:00.112
Oh, no, no, no, just
a little tingly.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.778
Must have touched a live
wire or something.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.152
Half the shuttle's power
conduits had ruptured.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.904
I've shut those circuits down.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.656
The cargo's fine.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.283
No damage to its containment.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.536
What is the cargo?

04:14.672 --> 04:18.210
Do you expect me to
tell a Peacekeeper?

04:18.342 --> 04:21.209
Well, she's retired, sort of.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.052
We have all escaped from
the Peacekeepers.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.467
She is one of us now.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.340
Yes. 80, your cargo?

04:28.477 --> 04:33.267
Scientific apparatus would
be more accurate.

04:33.399 --> 04:38.268
We have been studying deep space
gravitational fluctuations.

04:38.404 --> 04:44.866
We were on our way to rendezvous
with another cruiser not
too far from here.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.404
If you could take us there...

04:46.537 --> 04:50.200
Of course. Our ship is yours.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.165
You honor us Ka D'argo.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.252
You'll need the coordinates
of our rendezvous point.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.371
Our guidance station
is this way.

04:58.507 --> 05:02.091
Ah. Rest and revitalize.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.426
I'll take care of it.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.425
Thank you.

05:20.196 --> 05:21.686
(grunts)

05:23.324 --> 05:24.234
Ooh.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.981
Something the matter?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.076
Um...

05:29.205 --> 05:30.285
No.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.201
Just, ljust had a, uh...

05:34.752 --> 05:36.458
Whew, I don't know what
I just had.

05:36.587 --> 05:40.421
Well, perhaps you need to
rest and revitalize, too.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.249
Yeah.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.376
I guess that's a good idea.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.933
The coordinates are
now locked in.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.520
How soon can we get there?

05:56.649 --> 05:58.560
Pilot will let us know
soon enough.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.728
Rygel: Of course, the real
question is...

06:00.861 --> 06:02.101
what's it worth to you?

06:02.238 --> 06:04.900
Bearing in mind, of course, that
we've already saved your lives.

06:05.032 --> 06:10.117
Yes, you have, and we're
most appreciative.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.113
Then you'll want to express
that appreciation before
we agree to...

06:13.249 --> 06:14.159
No bargains.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.280
What?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.248
These are my friends.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.208
Fnends?

06:18.337 --> 06:21.295
You? You've only just met them.

06:23.259 --> 06:26.251
(groaning)

06:26.387 --> 06:30.346
My friends are llanics, genetic
cousins to the Luxans.

06:30.474 --> 06:36.014
Our races have been blood allies
for over 1,000 cycles.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.980
We shall extend them every
courtesy.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.100
Is that clear?

06:43.237 --> 06:45.273
(growling)

06:48.117 --> 06:50.199
You must excuse the Hynerian.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.569
His manners match his size.

06:53.706 --> 06:56.243
We will reach that location
in twelve arnes.

06:56.375 --> 07:00.414
Perfect. And the cruiser shall
reach us there soon after.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.539
Is there anything I can offer
you in the meantime to
eat or to drink?

07:04.675 --> 07:09.635
For myself, no, but I'd like to
get Verell to eat something.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.220
Will you accompany me?

07:19.023 --> 07:21.230
More, Verell?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.228
No, thank you.

07:24.236 --> 07:28.855
So, you, Zhaan and Rygel

07:28.991 --> 07:33.109
escaped Peacekeeper imprisonment
and commandeered this ship?

07:33.245 --> 07:36.237
l have left out one part.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.240
The crime for which
I was imprisoned.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.206
Was it treason?

07:40.336 --> 07:41.746
No. It...

07:41.879 --> 07:44.291
Then I don't need to hear of it.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.290
Matala and I owe you our lives.

07:47.426 --> 07:54.173
Whatever your past, exile
from your own kind is
atonement enough.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.258
How long has it been?

07:57.394 --> 08:00.181
Nearly eight cycles.

08:00.314 --> 08:06.150
If you've been out of contact
for eight cycles then you
haven't heard,

08:06.278 --> 08:09.315
the llanic Sector is at war.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.318
The Scorvians?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.066
Yes.

08:14.203 --> 08:18.242
Three cycles ago, they attacked
an outlying colony.

08:18.374 --> 08:21.081
Completely unprovoked.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.202
Slaughtered two million
civilians.

08:25.089 --> 08:27.455
We've been fighting ever since.

08:27.591 --> 08:33.086
Massive casualties, and
no end in sight.

08:34.098 --> 08:36.885
And the Luxans?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.973
Do they fight at your side?

08:39.103 --> 08:44.348
Your people have been more than
generous with troops, armaments.

08:44.483 --> 08:48.271
Far beyond what our mutual
treaty requires.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.069
How can I help you now?

08:51.198 --> 08:56.192
Luxans truly are the best
allies one could want.

08:56.328 --> 09:01.743
Just getting us to the
rendezvous point will help
the war effort more than you can know.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.625
Get away from that hatch!

09:12.761 --> 09:14.001
What's inside there?

09:14.138 --> 09:17.551
We've already told you,
very sensitive equipment

09:17.683 --> 09:21.221
that contains a cycle's worth of
complex sensor readings.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.184
Hmm. Well I'd like to see it.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.849
I said, get away...

09:24.982 --> 09:28.566
Ah. You've had some training.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.439
Care to test it?

09:34.366 --> 09:36.027
Is there a problem here?

09:36.160 --> 09:39.277
l was just scanning for those
broken power conduits
she mentioned.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.780
I thought that if I could
identify them, the Drds
could repair them.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.328
I never asked you to
fix anything.

09:45.461 --> 09:49.921
Well, I took it upon myself.

09:50.048 --> 09:56.044
Please, D'Argo, if anything were
to happen to our data, all our
hard work would be lost.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.388
Surely an operational pod is
of much more use to us...

09:59.516 --> 10:02.758
We respect their wishes.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.386
I do not want to see
you in here again.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.613
Fine. I'll leave you both to it.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.745
She will not return.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.496
That someone would send a
cruiser with only two scientists

10:28.629 --> 10:31.120
all the way out here
just for research?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.372
There are many species
who seek...

10:44.686 --> 10:46.847
(grunts)

10:47.648 --> 10:49.013
Were you going to say something?

10:49.149 --> 10:53.313
No. Well, yes.
I'm... l'm...

10:53.445 --> 10:55.561
Sorry, I just went somewhere
else for a second there.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.528
Uh... you were saying?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.694
Oh. I just don't trust them.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.943
The female especially.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.410
Matala? W-why not?

11:03.539 --> 11:05.700
Well, she's clearly leading
D'argo around by his mivonks

11:05.833 --> 11:08.165
and I think she's having some
sort of an effect on you.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.499
Me?

11:09.628 --> 11:12.165
That's B.S.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.629
She's an entirely different
species. We could never...

11:16.218 --> 11:20.086
John... hold still.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.508
You'll like this.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.677
Hold still.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.604
Is something wrong, John?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.867
Something's happening and l...

11:43.537 --> 11:46.244
Something like l'vejust been...

11:48.041 --> 11:50.418
I'm just going to get some air.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.209
We have air in here.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.414
What is the matter with him?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.796
He is Crichton.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.432
Ah. D'argo.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.267
Come in, please.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.727
I do not want to disturb you.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.767
Not at all. Don't forget,

12:12.900 --> 12:18.987
for nearly a cycle my only
companion has been Matala.

12:19.114 --> 12:22.231
Some would find that situation
most desirable.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.743
Ah.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.157
Then you find her desirable?

12:27.289 --> 12:28.870
Please forgive me, I had
no right to...

12:28.999 --> 12:31.160
There's nothing to forgive.

12:31.293 --> 12:34.330
Matala's a colleague,
nothing more.

12:34.463 --> 12:38.877
If you want her, then by all
means, begin the Luxan chase.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.840
l, uh...

12:40.969 --> 12:42.470
I couldn't.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.382
As you prefer.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.802
It's clear she wants you.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.803
D'argo.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.853
It's so kind of you to let us
borrow your workbench.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.361
Are you repairing something?

12:58.487 --> 13:01.399
Uh, building something.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.489
Could it be a shilquen?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.108
How did you know?

13:06.244 --> 13:13.582
Oh, I've always taken a special
interest in Luxan objects.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.167
The workmanship is exquisite.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.163
Your hands are quite skilled.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.085
D'argo! It's...

13:21.218 --> 13:22.674
Oh.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.418
Oh, uh, hi.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.216
Friend. Crichton.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.132
Hey can I talk to you?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.304
Yeah. Uh...

13:33.271 --> 13:34.886
Now.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.234
Trouble.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.153
Listen, D'argo...

13:44.282 --> 13:46.147
llanics are related to
Luxans, right?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.444
So you know all about them.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.078
We're distantly related.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.490
All right, well, llanic women...

13:51.623 --> 13:54.581
when it comes to attracting men
do they have any...?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.166
Um...

13:56.294 --> 13:59.161
What? Special pheromones?

13:59.297 --> 14:03.131
You know, body chemistry that
acts like a, uh, an aphrodisiac?

14:03.260 --> 14:06.218
-No.
-Well, how ab... how about
mental abilities?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.337
Do they have, like, telepathic
powers of seduction?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.134
Psychic Spanish Fly?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.258
You know, that?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.300
Why do you ask?

14:14.438 --> 14:18.522
Look. No, no, this has nothing
to do with you but...

14:18.650 --> 14:20.641
I've been having these flashes

14:20.777 --> 14:22.984
and I'm somewhere else

14:23.113 --> 14:24.944
and Matala's there.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.449
All right?

14:26.575 --> 14:30.318
You know, we're like...
getting horizontal.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.365
Vertical. It's...

14:32.497 --> 14:33.782
Huh?

14:33.915 --> 14:35.997
You...

14:36.126 --> 14:37.366
and Matala?

14:37.502 --> 14:40.164
Yeah. I don't know, it's crazy.
I mean, are we even compatible?

14:40.297 --> 14:44.256
I don't know but...
like... it's real.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.249
I can feel her, I can touch her.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.214
You are fantasizing about her.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.342
Remove her from your thoughts.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.060
Trust me, I'm trying.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.271
( growls )

14:59.399 --> 15:00.354
Hey.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.770
Hey, check the attitude, pal.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.194
She's not my type!

15:06.323 --> 15:07.984
-Where is he?
-Who?

15:08.116 --> 15:11.779
D'argo. Is he still behaving
like Verell and Matala's
personal servant?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.502
Personal servant?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.960
That's new.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.424
What...?

15:30.347 --> 15:32.679
-Where is he?
-Who?

15:32.808 --> 15:37.643
D'argo. Is he still behaving
like Verell and Matala's
personal servant?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.485
Did you hear me?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.944
Yeah, I heard you fine.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.404
Twice.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.990
You are very odd, Crichton.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.201
That just happened.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.541
That was real. That happened.
Which means...

16:01.670 --> 16:04.377
I'm not hallucinating, so if...

16:04.506 --> 16:07.418
if I'm not hallucinating,
then...

16:08.426 --> 16:11.008
I'm seeing the future.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.185
Oh boy.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.933
That's the future.

17:14.743 --> 17:16.404
( neck cracks )

17:27.339 --> 17:31.503
Okay, John, don't freak.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.174
Get a grip, man.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.841
You don't know you've come
unstuck in time.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.682
(woman screaming )

17:43.021 --> 17:44.557
D'argo, wait!

17:44.689 --> 17:46.771
Oh, thank God you're okay. Look,
man, you can't go in there.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.185
Why not?

17:48.318 --> 17:51.902
Because Matala's in there and
she's going to try
to kill you...

17:52.030 --> 17:54.442
me... us... and stab Verell.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.155
She might have already done it.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.275
Crichton, you disgust me.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.699
Do you think this clumsy ruse
will turn me away from Matala?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.696
No, no, no. It's not a ruse.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.082
I know it sounds crazy but...

18:06.211 --> 18:10.045
You want her and you'll do
anything to get her.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.415
I do not want Matala.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.257
Would you listen to me?

18:15.387 --> 18:20.131
Look, open your ears, or your
tentacles, or whatever orifice
it is you listen with.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.634
I think the woman is dangerous.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.233
Verell...

18:32.362 --> 18:33.647
Where is Matala?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.988
She just left with the
Peacekeeper, Aeryn.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.904
l have brought you some
Contala tea.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.027
Most kind of you.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.373
Bring it right in.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.089
This is not happening.
It's not...

19:03.059 --> 19:05.220
It's just not happening. It's...

19:06.813 --> 19:08.314
I'm glad you're joining me.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.273
Me, too. And I'm really in the
mood for some physical activity.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.108
John.

19:14.237 --> 19:18.230
Aeryn's invited me to partake
in some physical conditioning
with her.

19:18.366 --> 19:21.233
Good. That's good.
That's real good.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.861
So you'll be down in the
cargo bay, right?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.204
Yes. As usual.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.164
For a while, right?

19:28.293 --> 19:30.375
Yes. As long as she can keep up.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.253
How is your hand?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.415
Come, if you're coming.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.641
(chewing loudly)

19:53.234 --> 19:54.064
Rygel.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.559
Uh-oh!
(swallows loudly)

19:55.695 --> 19:59.279
Zhaan, did you see how much food
D'argo gave those llanics?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.739
Well, he's not getting my share.

20:01.868 --> 20:06.237
You've been aboard Moya
longer than anyone else
except Pilot.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.409
Your point being?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.408
You know her sounds and
her rhythms.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.581
Just stop and listen to her
for a moment.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.796
All right.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.085
Moya sounds fine.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.008
Does she?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.641
Not to me.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.637
Something feels...

20:28.770 --> 20:31.136
out of balance.

20:55.338 --> 20:59.251
I suppose Peacekeepers don't
need to know that much.

20:59.384 --> 21:03.172
Their females have no need
for science or culture

21:03.304 --> 21:06.216
or even the art of
attracting males.

21:06.349 --> 21:11.434
Unlike females who can only
achieve their goals by seducing
male after male.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.602
Guess we both have our
unique talents.

21:37.589 --> 21:38.499
More?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.794
Or are we through here?

21:51.811 --> 21:55.395
I thank you for the exercise.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.237
Matala?

22:13.625 --> 22:16.537
The first symptoms of trouble
you had with your ship,
what were they?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.205
Verell told you.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.125
We knew nothing until the phase
couplers overloaded.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.588
Think back.

22:22.717 --> 22:26.255
Slight irregularities that
meant nothing to you?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.888
We noticed nothing.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.220
And what does it matter now?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.681
Our ship is gone.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.185
Perhaps Verell will help.

22:33.311 --> 22:36.053
I'm sure he'll be glad to help
you, when he's free.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.898
And while we wait,
you can help me.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.015
Yes?

22:41.152 --> 22:43.268
I'm curious about Crichton.

22:43.404 --> 22:48.524
Far too complex, I'm afraid, for
you to know in the short time
that you'll be here.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.493
| suggest you shouldn't try.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.909
Now, I really must speak
with Verell.

22:57.335 --> 23:00.577
I don't blame you for
being concerned,

23:00.713 --> 23:04.456
especially after what happened
to my ship.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.334
You said the problem was
phase related,

23:07.470 --> 23:10.382
and didn't become apparent until
it was too late to fix.

23:10.515 --> 23:16.135
But it was caused by a
malfunction in our
core regulator.

23:16.271 --> 23:22.892
A subsystem that Leviathans
like Moya do not possess.

23:23.027 --> 23:29.364
In fact, I doubt that Moya's
phase imbalance actually exists.

23:29.492 --> 23:35.613
Probably a sensor synapse
out of calibration.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.454
( belches )

23:37.584 --> 23:40.200
D'argo, Matala...

23:40.336 --> 23:42.452
to interrupt these future events

23:42.589 --> 23:46.081
I got to prevent...

23:46.217 --> 23:48.378
I need to keep people
from-from-from seeing
each other.

23:48.511 --> 23:52.504
Must you gibber while I'm
eating, or at all?

23:56.519 --> 23:57.975
Damn.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.418
ldon't think so.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.631
(9898)

24:31.554 --> 24:33.795
I'm on a ship of lunatics.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.013
John, what is it?

24:37.268 --> 24:39.725
This is going to take a
lot of explaining.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.685
But do it in private.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.930
( choking )

24:44.067 --> 24:51.439
We weren't here to research but
to field test a new weapon...

24:51.574 --> 24:56.068
one that could end our agonizing
war against the Scorvians.

24:56.204 --> 25:02.074
This weapon is so powerful that
it requires a containment field.

25:02.210 --> 25:05.794
We didn't realize this until our
cruiser had malfunctioned.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.254
By the time we got it working,
it was too late.

25:08.383 --> 25:12.672
Luckily, we were able to
save the weapon.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.669
It's in our shuttle.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.262
ls Moya in any danger?

25:16.391 --> 25:17.471
No.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.013
The containment field will
protect her and us.

25:21.145 --> 25:24.433
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

25:24.565 --> 25:26.101
Didn't you trust me?

25:26.234 --> 25:30.477
You are a Luxan, but
you also are,

25:30.613 --> 25:33.355
were, a prisoner.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.484
We cannot be certain of your
loyalties.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.902
Are you now?

25:40.039 --> 25:42.246
We need you, D'argo.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.492
Whatever the risk to this ship,
it must be taken.

25:45.628 --> 25:51.089
Without this weapon millions
more llanic lives will be lost.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.300
Can we count on you?

25:55.763 --> 25:57.879
Yes.

26:01.310 --> 26:05.394
Believe me, I know how crazy
it all sounds.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.890
Premonitions.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.687
Future flashes.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.560
The concept is a
fascinating one.

26:12.697 --> 26:16.565
Yeah, well, it could just still
be a concept, you know.

26:16.701 --> 26:19.693
I could just be going plain
old bonkers here.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.537
But I guess it's about time
for that to happen.

26:25.168 --> 26:29.002
If these future flashes are
indeed occurring as
you say, John,

26:29.130 --> 26:32.668
then you could simply alter the
sequence of events and
change the future.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.085
I thought of that.

26:34.218 --> 26:38.052
Yeah, just lock myself in my
room wait for them to leave.

26:38.181 --> 26:42.515
But Matala could still murder
Verell and D'argo, if that's
what she intends to do.

26:42.643 --> 26:47.103
| just don't know why she would
want to kill us.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.140
ldon't know what the game is.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.526
Oh, hell.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.780
I'm sorry.

26:54.906 --> 26:57.397
That's all right, John.

27:03.831 --> 27:09.246
Zhaan, you said you didn't quite
buy Verell's explanation

27:09.378 --> 27:11.539
for the phase imbalance, right?

27:11.672 --> 27:14.254
Not entirely.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.839
Well, I think it's time the old
goat spilled his guts.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.669
Verell!

27:20.807 --> 27:23.344
You've been lying to...
to us... us.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.805
Why would he do that?

27:26.938 --> 27:28.269
Where's Verell?

27:28.397 --> 27:30.012
You need to calm down.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.562
Rest and revitalize.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.310
l have a technique that
just might...

27:36.447 --> 27:37.527
Back off, nature girl.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.238
Keep your hands to yourself.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.858
Now, you tell me what really
happened to your ship.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.030
And why are you trying
to kill Verell?!

27:45.998 --> 27:47.204
D'argo...

27:47.333 --> 27:48.834
help me.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.325
He knows the truth.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.201
He threatened to tell
the others,

27:52.338 --> 27:56.672
make them turn against me
unless I pleasured him.

27:56.801 --> 27:59.338
Oh, she's lying! I never...

27:59.470 --> 28:02.052
D'argo, what are you doing?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.297
Matala!

28:14.986 --> 28:19.195
If these future flashes are
indeed occurring as
you say, John,

28:19.323 --> 28:22.861
then you could simply alter the
sequence of events and change
the future.

28:22.994 --> 28:26.077
|-|-|-|... | just did.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.823
ljust did. I changed the
future, and I made it worse!

28:32.295 --> 28:33.375
l'm...

28:33.504 --> 28:35.165
sorry.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.209
That's all right, John.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.377
Again.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.260
(glass breaking )

28:47.393 --> 28:48.348
Don't you get it?

28:48.477 --> 28:51.310
Ge... ljust had another
look into the future

28:51.439 --> 28:54.181
and this time, instead of
Matala snapping my neck

28:54.317 --> 28:56.808
D'argo skewers me with
his Qualta Blade.

28:56.944 --> 29:01.233
So, according to this
premonition D'argo
will kill you?

29:01.365 --> 29:03.572
Yeah, yeah. I think the llanics
have turned him around somehow.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.191
I don't know.

29:05.328 --> 29:06.408
I will talk to him.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.949
Talk? What, are you giving me
a character reference?!

29:09.081 --> 29:12.869
I just felt the blade slice
through my guts, okay?!

29:14.211 --> 29:16.076
| just found something out.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.545
Matala is not llanic.
She's Scorvian.

29:18.674 --> 29:22.587
Her llanic appearance must be
the result of genetic surgery.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.051
How do you know this?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.762
Because she fights like
a Scorvian.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.256
The workout, y-you set that up?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.474
You saw her moves?
So, like, you saw the...

29:30.603 --> 29:34.391
Scorvian Neural Stroke, yeah.
How do you know about that?

29:34.523 --> 29:36.229
Yeah, well, I saw it
in the future.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.145
What do you mean?

29:38.277 --> 29:40.313
Look, just... you know what?
Ask me later.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.528
Just ask me later, when
I got more time.

29:42.657 --> 29:45.990
Of course, I could be dead three
or four times by the time
you ask, but...

29:46.118 --> 29:47.949
Crichton's right.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.115
We may not have much time.

29:50.247 --> 29:56.117
lf Matala truly is a Scorvian
agent, then perhaps she's only
with Verell to spy on him.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.709
No, "spy," no, no, no.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.624
Kill...

29:59.757 --> 30:03.921
and I guarantee you, Verell's
research, it's a lot bigger
than academic research

30:04.053 --> 30:06.795
and I think that D'argo
knows about it.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.547
Look, enough talk. I say we
confront them and force
the truth out.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.424
No, we can't do that.

30:11.560 --> 30:15.974
No, because D'argo thinks that
Verell and Matala are some
kind of llanic angels.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.268
Then we separate them.

30:18.401 --> 30:22.064
We get D'argo and Matala out of
there and talk to Verell alone.

30:22.196 --> 30:25.188
Once he understands that we're
not the enemy, then...

30:25.324 --> 30:27.406
Pilot:
Zhaan? Zhaan?

30:27.535 --> 30:28.866
Yes, Pilot?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.906
I thought you'd want to know
the phase imbalance

30:31.038 --> 30:33.245
in Moya's converters is
getting worse.

30:33.374 --> 30:38.619
If there's a problem with Moya
perhaps D'argo would be helpful
in tracking it down.

30:38.754 --> 30:43.919
D'argo, we have a slight
technical problem, something
about a phase imbalance.

30:44.051 --> 30:47.885
Can you meet us in the Command,
give us your assistance, please?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.424
D'Argo:
I'll be right there.

30:49.557 --> 30:53.141
l'll lay odds, one of the
noodleheads, they come
up with D'argo

30:53.269 --> 30:55.885
and lay off this phase imbalance
as insignificant.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.183
What if all three come up?

30:58.315 --> 31:00.567
There's no way they'll leave
their shuttle unguarded.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.274
One of them will remain behind.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.064
Well, that'll be Verell.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.609
He's not going to leave his
work. Watch.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.449
D'Argo:
The others are worried about the
core temperature on the pod.

31:10.578 --> 31:13.786
The imbalance can't be
significant.

31:13.914 --> 31:16.121
They worry over nothing.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.286
Why can't we tell them that?

31:18.419 --> 31:20.535
What if they don't believe us?

31:20.671 --> 31:23.583
What if they demand to know more
about what Verell is doing?

31:23.716 --> 31:25.957
D'Argo:
The Scorvians are devious
but I can assure you

31:26.093 --> 31:29.301
that no one aboard this ship
is a Scorvian spy.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.757
Brave D'argo...

31:31.891 --> 31:35.679
you have already proven yourself
a hundred times over.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.312
Tell me.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.851
Is it possible you'd ever
considerjoining us?

31:40.983 --> 31:42.223
What do you mean?

31:42.359 --> 31:45.101
Becoming a soldier for
the llanic cause.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.570
Pledging to fight by our sides
in the battle ahead.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.567
I wish I could do as you ask.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.614
But, um...

31:54.747 --> 31:57.159
it's not nearly as
simple as that.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.031
(sighs)

31:59.168 --> 32:03.127
Matala:
Is it because of your crimes?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.961
Verell told me.

32:06.967 --> 32:10.630
I did not tell Verell
what my crime was.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.924
No one aboard this ship
knows the real truth.

32:13.057 --> 32:16.845
Matala:
It matters not what has come
between you and your people.

32:16.977 --> 32:22.062
D'argo, war does not recognize
multiple loyalties.

32:22.191 --> 32:26.935
On the battlefield,
there is only them...

32:34.745 --> 32:36.701
and us.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.288
Zhaan:
D'argo, I'm waiting for you.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.074
We should go.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.334
(panting)

32:48.467 --> 32:50.674
I'm on my way, Zhaan.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.135
Crichton:
Verell...

32:57.893 --> 33:00.179
Please, I'm extremely busy.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.896
These data correlations demand
my total attention.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.187
Well, I suggest you refocus
your total attention

33:07.319 --> 33:10.777
'cause there's some crap going
down that just might be of
interest to you.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.066
"Crap"?

33:12.199 --> 33:14.986
Yes, crap.

33:15.119 --> 33:20.739
Crap like I know you're not
out here in the uncharted
territories doing research.

33:20.875 --> 33:25.118
Crap like you have enemies
called the "Scorpions"

33:25.254 --> 33:28.621
and that your trusted colleague
Matala is a spy for them,

33:28.757 --> 33:31.169
who as best I can tell, is
dead set on killing you.

33:33.304 --> 33:37.172
Yeah, well, my entire life
has become nonsense,

33:37.308 --> 33:39.970
so I suggest you listen to me
because if I'm right,

33:40.102 --> 33:42.593
it means that all of
your research...

33:43.772 --> 33:45.933
ends up in the hands
of your enemy.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.226
So, D'argo and l, we pulled you
two out of the shuttle.

33:50.362 --> 33:54.071
I go back in and | get zapped by
some loose wire or something.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.565
You remember that?

33:55.701 --> 33:57.066
Vaguely.

33:57.203 --> 34:02.323
Well, ever since then I've been
having these time flashes.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.911
Into the future.

34:09.298 --> 34:10.959
Excuse me?

34:14.136 --> 34:17.219
(blipping and warbling)

34:17.348 --> 34:19.634
Ah... Entropic oscillations...

34:19.767 --> 34:21.974
Anomalous phase signatures...

34:22.102 --> 34:27.768
That would account for the
dislocation you are
experiencing.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.356
"Temporal dislocation"?

34:29.485 --> 34:33.819
You must've been exposed to...

34:33.948 --> 34:37.111
Exposed to what?

34:37.243 --> 34:41.407
What you said about Matala.
What makes you believe that?

34:41.538 --> 34:44.496
What exactly did you see
in the future?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.161
Exposed to what?

34:46.293 --> 34:48.284
What's in the damn shuttle?

34:50.339 --> 34:53.547
A quantum singularity.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.131
A black hole?

34:58.264 --> 35:01.222
A minute particle of one, yes.

35:01.350 --> 35:06.890
Its power and application
are unimaginable.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.059
It is the ultimate weapon.

35:11.568 --> 35:16.403
You capture a piece
of black hole...

35:17.241 --> 35:19.152
and you're going to use
it as a weapon?

35:19.285 --> 35:23.654
My species' very existence
depends on it.

35:23.789 --> 35:28.704
If you are right about Matala,
she will kill for it.

35:28.836 --> 35:32.249
"Right about Matala," Verell?

35:32.381 --> 35:33.962
In what way?

35:34.091 --> 35:35.922
Explain yourself.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.666
What has he told you?

35:37.803 --> 35:41.466
That you are not who
you say you are.

35:41.598 --> 35:45.511
That you are a
Scorvian impostor.

35:45.644 --> 35:49.387
Oh, Verell...

35:50.357 --> 35:51.597
you can't...
( hissing )

35:51.734 --> 35:52.940
Aeryn, now.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.444
(grunts)

35:56.447 --> 35:57.903
Get your ass in here!

35:58.032 --> 35:59.442
Now, Aeryn!

35:59.575 --> 36:01.156
Verell:
Matala...

36:05.205 --> 36:07.070
(groaning and gasping)

36:16.592 --> 36:17.456
D'argo!

36:17.593 --> 36:19.254
Aeryn:
Crichton, she sealed the doors.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.175
What happened?

36:21.305 --> 36:22.715
Aeryn.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.135
(rumbling)

36:26.268 --> 36:29.385
Matala, she's making
a run for it.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.261
Not if I can help it.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.317
No!

36:39.156 --> 36:40.692
Oh God!

36:41.408 --> 36:42.784
(roaring)

36:42.910 --> 36:47.370
(rumbling and whining)

36:50.584 --> 36:54.918
Zhaan: If these future flashes
are indeed occurring
as you say, John,

36:55.047 --> 37:00.167
then you could simply alter the
sequence of events and
change the future.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.137
Oh, man,

37:05.265 --> 37:06.846
(emotional sigh)

37:07.601 --> 37:09.762
it just happened again.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.811
What did? A premonition?

37:46.849 --> 37:48.134
Aeryn:
I've just found something out.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.132
Crichton:
Yes. Yes, we know.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.306
Matala is not Ilanic.
She's a Scorvian in disguise.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.351
Matala a Scorvian?

37:56.483 --> 37:58.474
How did you find out?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.226
He says he is experiencing
the future.

38:01.363 --> 38:02.443
The future?

38:02.573 --> 38:04.529
You can barely function
in the present.

38:04.658 --> 38:08.321
If Matala truly is a Scorvian,
then she is with Verell to...

38:08.454 --> 38:11.617
Crichton:
Spy on him and to kill him.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.581
Look, I've already lived
through all this.

38:14.710 --> 38:18.373
Well, whatever's going on I
say we confront them and
force them...

38:18.505 --> 38:19.620
Doesn't work.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.132
Then we separate them and...

38:21.258 --> 38:23.590
Been there, done that.
It's not going to work.

38:23.719 --> 38:24.754
Pilot:
Zhaan?

38:24.887 --> 38:26.127
Yes, Pilot, we know.

38:26.263 --> 38:28.504
The phase imbalance is
getting worse.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.891
That's correct.

38:30.017 --> 38:32.178
No, not now, Pilot.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.262
Crichton:
D'argo.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.605
The key is D'argo.

38:38.734 --> 38:40.565
Okay? D'argo is the key.

38:40.694 --> 38:45.563
As long as he is with Matala
the timeline keeps getting
worse and worse.

38:45.699 --> 38:46.984
We got to talk to him alone.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.278
We got to get him
away from Matala.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.323
We cannot ask him to come up to
the Command and deal with

38:52.456 --> 38:54.868
the phase imbalance because he's
going to bring Matala with him.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.786
We have got...

39:09.306 --> 39:11.467
We've got to try something new.

39:15.521 --> 39:18.433
Matala:
Ready for transport, D'argo.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.264
Hold still.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.312
I'm sorry to disturb
you, D'argo.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.401
But could you speak to Rygel?

39:25.531 --> 39:27.112
Now what's he done?

39:27.241 --> 39:31.280
He has presented a bill for
the rescue and transportation
of our guests.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.824
He intends to present it to the
Ilanics when we rendezvous.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.243
My people would be more...

39:37.376 --> 39:39.241
I won't hear of it.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.539
I've explained this
to him before.

39:41.672 --> 39:44.038
I will explain it to him again.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.675
Excuse me.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.602
Where is that Hynerian bandit?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.436
Where is he?

40:05.153 --> 40:06.563
Where is he!

40:17.749 --> 40:27.249
Yes, that definitely solves
the containment field
instability problem.

40:27.384 --> 40:31.093
How much time until
the rendezvous?

40:31.221 --> 40:33.598
Sooner than you think.

40:33.724 --> 40:37.216
And you believe these
premonitions of crimes
are genuine?

40:37.352 --> 40:39.217
He is convincing enough.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.221
We need to subdue Matala as a
precaution if nothing else.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.973
And we need to get that shuttle
out of Moya ASAP.

40:45.110 --> 40:48.273
Listen, D'argo, I wish to God
Matala was telling you the truth

40:48.405 --> 40:51.067
that you could go off with her
and join the Ilanic wars.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.110
What are you talking about?

40:53.243 --> 40:54.904
Oh, you haven't had that
conversation.

40:55.037 --> 40:56.993
Look, Matala's going to
offer you that

40:57.122 --> 40:59.704
to keep you off balance and
to distance you from us.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.164
I don't believe any of this.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.375
It's you who are trying to
distance me from them.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.085
D'argo, please, if what Crichton
is saying is so...

41:06.214 --> 41:07.545
Well, it isn't so!

41:07.674 --> 41:09.255
Leave us alone.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.885
Let me talk to him in private.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.171
Crichton, are you sure?

41:12.304 --> 41:13.794
There is no more to say.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.670
Just go.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.092
Go.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.100
There is nothing you
can say to me...

41:21.229 --> 41:23.436
Would you shut up and
you listen to me?!

41:23.565 --> 41:28.275
In that future conversation
when Matala offers you to
go to the Ilanic wars,

41:28.403 --> 41:30.735
you tell her it isn't possible.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.105
You tell her that your crime,

41:33.241 --> 41:36.779
the crime that you were
imprisoned for, would
stand in the way.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.403
And not the crime that
you told us.

41:39.539 --> 41:43.953
Not the crime that you say you
were in prison for, but
the real crime.

41:44.086 --> 41:48.329
The crime that you've been
keeping secret from everybody
on board this ship.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.377
How do you know that?

41:51.510 --> 41:53.250
You can't.

41:53.387 --> 41:55.173
Well, I do know...

41:55.305 --> 41:57.136
and I'm telling you the truth.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.014
D'argo,

42:00.143 --> 42:02.680
Matala is the enemy.

42:08.819 --> 42:10.559
Look, I'm sorry.

42:19.538 --> 42:22.029
Aeryn: Crichton, there's a
vessel approaching.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.450
It's the Ilanic cruiser.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.746
We're still some distance from
the rendezvous point.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.379
It is an Ilanic cruiser.

42:31.508 --> 42:35.296
Or looks like one. Like Matala,
it might be Scorvian
on the inside.

42:35.429 --> 42:37.260
How fast can we starburst
out of here?

42:37.389 --> 42:39.721
We'll be in her gun range long
before Moya's ready.

42:39.850 --> 42:41.806
Can we outrun her without
starburst?

42:41.935 --> 42:44.426
No, but I can outmaneuver her
and keep her from a
weapons lock.

42:44.563 --> 42:47.225
Zhaan, talk to em. See if
you can distract em.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.143
See if you can figure out
who they are.

42:49.276 --> 42:52.894
Scorvians look nothing
like Ilanics.

42:53.029 --> 42:56.271
If they refuse to make
visual contact.

42:56.408 --> 42:59.070
You have your answer.

42:59.202 --> 43:00.612
In which case, I start dodging.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.702
Matala. D'argo, wait!

43:02.831 --> 43:04.992
We got to play this smart.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.207
Communication coming through.

43:07.335 --> 43:11.248
Male voice: Greetings. We regret
that our comm system has
a malfunction.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.087
Permission to dock and
come aboard?

43:13.216 --> 43:16.299
Aeryn: Don't even bother
responding, Zhaan. Pilot.

43:26.188 --> 43:27.598
I've got it, Pilot.

43:31.026 --> 43:33.267
Verell! Stand away from her.

43:33.403 --> 43:36.861
D'argo, what's wrong?

43:38.867 --> 43:40.858
Who are you, Matala?

43:40.994 --> 43:42.279
Who are you, really?

43:42.412 --> 43:44.824
What is the meaning of this?

43:44.956 --> 43:46.617
What are you going
to do, D'argo?

43:46.750 --> 43:48.286
Shoot me?

43:48.418 --> 43:49.703
If I have to.

43:49.836 --> 43:53.875
If the approaching ship proves
to be a Scorvian vessel.

43:54.007 --> 43:56.293
No, D'argo.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.132
You'll see.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.637
The coming ship,

43:59.763 --> 44:01.970
it's Ilanic.

44:02.098 --> 44:06.262
D'argo, trust your heart.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.680
Your heart knows the truth.

44:08.814 --> 44:10.850
You can trust me.

44:10.982 --> 44:11.607
No!

44:11.733 --> 44:13.064
Keep back!

44:13.193 --> 44:14.649
I'll kill him.

44:14.778 --> 44:15.688
Verell:
Matala?

44:15.821 --> 44:16.776
Shut up!

44:16.905 --> 44:19.442
D'argo, drop the rifle!

44:19.825 --> 44:21.065
Drop the rifle!

44:21.201 --> 44:23.157
Kick it towards me now!

44:36.508 --> 44:39.500
Verell:
Matala, why are you doing this?

44:39.636 --> 44:41.217
She's Scorvian.

44:42.264 --> 44:44.300
My word as a Luxan.

44:47.561 --> 44:49.347
( groans )

44:50.605 --> 44:51.981
( hisses )

44:53.483 --> 44:54.563
My turn.

44:54.693 --> 44:56.183
(grunts)

45:11.418 --> 45:13.534
Crichton:
D'argo, leave it!

45:13.670 --> 45:15.331
No!

45:16.798 --> 45:19.710
You try to stop her with this
thing, you're going to
kill us all.

45:20.844 --> 45:22.709
You have to trust me.

45:33.356 --> 45:35.096
Verell:
Black hole...

45:35.233 --> 45:37.315
Black hole...

45:37.444 --> 45:40.481
must destroy...

45:40.614 --> 45:43.651
before Scorvians...

45:48.038 --> 45:49.869
(beeping and trilling)

46:07.515 --> 46:12.384
Pilot, I need starburst and
I'm talking right now.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.351
( screaming )

46:39.506 --> 46:41.462
Pilot:
All clear.

46:43.969 --> 46:45.880
(sighs)

46:46.012 --> 46:48.173
Matala.

46:53.186 --> 46:54.767
Sorry.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.649
I should have seen it coming.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.026
(burps)

47:09.911 --> 47:11.412
Rygel.

47:12.330 --> 47:15.117
(groaning)

47:15.250 --> 47:18.287
Little camper! You look
good, man.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.125
(burping)

47:19.254 --> 47:21.165
Gee, what is that smell?

47:21.297 --> 47:22.161
Whew!

47:22.298 --> 47:24.550
Tail end of a food binge,
I'm afraid.

47:24.676 --> 47:27.213
Very difficult to stop
when you get going.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.176
Which bit of me looks
good, exactly?

47:29.305 --> 47:33.093
The bit that's notjumping
back and forth in time.

47:33.226 --> 47:34.306
Food cube?

47:34.436 --> 47:37.269
Food cube?! Food cube?!

47:41.735 --> 47:44.602
Hey, how are you doing?

47:44.738 --> 47:46.274
I will recover.

47:46.406 --> 47:47.111
( chuckles )

47:47.240 --> 47:49.276
Yeah, when?

47:50.285 --> 47:52.571
Do you mock me?

47:52.704 --> 47:55.787
D'argo, I mock all of us.

47:55.915 --> 48:00.284
You know, you're not the first
to have his head snapped off
by a chick.

48:00.420 --> 48:03.127
I do not want to talk about it.

48:03.256 --> 48:04.712
Fine.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.214
But I'm right.

48:09.054 --> 48:11.966
My personal life is not
for discussion.

48:12.098 --> 48:20.221
This is a stupid question, but
do you consider your true crime
part of your personal life?

48:22.233 --> 48:24.440
I don't want to talk about it.

48:32.494 --> 48:38.160
Crichton, I am normally
unaffected by females
during a crisis.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.659
It's just...

48:43.838 --> 48:46.329
it has been so long.

48:48.134 --> 48:51.797
Oh, that... I understand.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.896
Man, do I understand.
