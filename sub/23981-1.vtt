<i>it's none of your </i><i> business. </i>

00:09.551 --> 00:11.094
<i>-This is a letter from my attorney!</i>
-Ooh, she's mad.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.512
Look at Jeana.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.596
<i>Give it to my attorney.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.390
You can see the anger rising.
<i>-Here's your letter...</i>

00:15.473 --> 00:16.599
Oh, "Stay out of my life."

00:16.683 --> 00:20.979
-That is a hurt person talking, Mickey.
Crazy.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.773
Oh, my God!
We just saw the craziest thing.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.277
This old guy and this girl,
they were arguing over something and...

00:27.360 --> 00:29.946
We couldn't tell
if it was a man and his daughter,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.365
or a man and his very young girlfriend.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.950
Is it her dad or not?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.828
We couldn't tell, but it was so funny.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.621
-Yeah, that's great.
-Funny.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
We were just trying to watch...

00:40.248 --> 00:41.875
-We're watching the show.
-Oh. Oh, sorry.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.042
-Watch.
-It's okay.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.377
It's fine, it's okay.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.004
Yeah.
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

00:46.087 --> 00:46.921
Who's that?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.049
Uh, Tamra. That's Tamra.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.969
<i>...me <i>...you.</i>
Wait,</i>

00:53.052 --> 00:54.429
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

00:55.430 --> 00:58.683
That's someone's,
uh, sister-in-law.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.310
<i>Bitch.</i>

01:02.520 --> 01:03.855
Okay, this is awesome.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.315
Can you pause while we get snacks,

01:05.398 --> 01:08.151
and maybe we'll see
if there's something else on, whatever.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.277
<i>I thought this was a classy party.</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:10.695
Uh, sure.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.493
Why can they not ever stay
at his place?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.038
-Let's have a look.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.039
Yeah.

01:22.707 --> 01:23.750
Oopsies!

01:23.833 --> 01:27.337
Sorry. Everything's okay.
I think, maybe not. We'll see.

01:27.921 --> 01:32.091
Tell you what, why don't we get out
of town this weekend, huh?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.885
Just go somewhere, do something fun?

01:34.844 --> 01:36.930
Want to go to Palm Springs?
I'll take you.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.641
-So funny. It was incredible.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.434
What's that about Palm Springs? -Oh, nothing.
-Nothing.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.978
Scooch on down.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.273
-Yeah.
Okay. Scooch, scooch, scooch.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.775
Get on the scooch-scooch train.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.692
-All right.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.944
Nope. That's all I have.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.613
Are we good? Okay, we're fully scooched.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.157
What was that about Palm Springs?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.701
-Nothing, it-- Nothing.
-Yeah, nothin'.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.954
-Oh...

02:01.412 --> 02:02.455
Uh...

02:03.081 --> 02:06.918
We were just sayin' it'd be fun to go
to Palm Springs some weekend

02:07.001 --> 02:09.921
for a little getaway, just the two of us.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.589
Holy shit. My cousin.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.175
He owns this house in Palm Springs
and rents it out.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.845
He's always telling me
that I can stay there for free.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.016
-Um, yeah, we'll think about that.
-We'll think about it. Thanks.

02:22.100 --> 02:22.934
-Think.
-Thanks.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.103
It's fuckin' huge. I've been there.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.439
It's, like, a luxury home
with, like, a pool and...

02:28.523 --> 02:32.485
Wait. Brain fart.
Why don't all four of us go together?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.612
The original four.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.407
It'd be my way of saying thanks
for the times you let me crash here.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.742
So, what do you guys think?
Are you in or...

02:39.826 --> 02:42.579
-Um... We'll do it.
-Sure.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.955
Yeah, the four of us.

02:44.038 --> 02:44.873
-Yeah.
-Oh, great.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.625
-Very fun.
-Palm Springs, baby. Here we come.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.377
-Okay.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.837
Yeah!

Randy, thanks so much for your generosity.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.085
-Yeah, thank you, Randy.
-Yeah, thank you.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.005
Aw. Well, it just makes me happy
to make you all happy.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.841
That's why I bought
those fireworks and that drone.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.593
-Uh-huh.

03:38.676 --> 03:39.719
That'll be fun.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.648
Hey, how close are we?

03:51.731 --> 03:54.359
Huh. Funny. My phone says
we're really pretty much there.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.820
Can I see your phone?
Okay. Wow.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.950
Yeah, that's weird. The house is here,
but then Palm Springs is...

04:02.033 --> 04:03.826
Over here.

04:05.703 --> 04:08.539
Oh. Yeah, well,
the house isn't like smack dab

04:08.623 --> 04:10.917
in the middle of "Palm Springs"
Palm Springs.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.293
More like Palm Springs' cousin.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.171
Okay. It says the house is in Hemet?
Hemay?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.172
How do you say that?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.882
How did your cousin say it?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.426
He always just said,
"Really close to Palm Springs."

04:20.510 --> 04:23.388
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah, but it's not.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.699
Fun fact, this is the town
where meth was invented.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.327
This is the bad part of town.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.176
Oh, yeah.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.262
Pretty cool, right?

05:04.345 --> 05:08.057
Yeah, very, like,
alternative cool.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.768
Yeah, I-- I like it.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.896
I like it. I like this big yard and the...
With the...

05:13.980 --> 05:16.899
How the driveway goes into the yard.
Very cool.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.194
Let's go in.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.824
Okay, here it is.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.159
Oh!

05:26.242 --> 05:28.286
My little oasis in the desert.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.915
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.083
Wow!

05:34.834 --> 05:36.335
Nice.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.506
Nice.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.550
Okay.
-I like it.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.926
Yeah.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.512
So who owns this place?

05:47.138 --> 05:50.016
Well, at first, it was my aunt's,
great aunt's.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.393
Her husband died in this train accident,

05:52.477 --> 05:55.480
and so she married this other dude,
and that other guy died.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.648
And then my great aunt died.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.943
And now my cousin just rents it out
to random people.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.279
Uh...

06:03.362 --> 06:05.406
Is anyone super hot? I'm boiling.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.118
-Yeah, it's pretty warm.
-Yeah, yeah, but no worries.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.413
'Cause Casa Del Monahan has AC.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.753
All righty, you're gonna have
to put on a coat after this.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.837
What the fuck?

06:19.921 --> 06:23.716
Weird. It doesn't look
more than ten years old.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.301
We can sweat all we want.

06:25.384 --> 06:29.138
The beads can run down our face
with this entertainment system.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.728
All right, the TV has power,
but we may not get <i>The Bachelor.</i>

06:36.312 --> 06:38.022
We can watch it when we get home, right?

06:42.026 --> 06:43.194
Master bedroom.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.029
Dibs.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.033
This is the guest bedroom.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.243
Mmm!

06:52.245 --> 06:53.412
Cozy.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.999
Ah, the master bath.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.924
This is the pool.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.889
Jesus, uh, I'm sorry, guys.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.766
Ah, bear, it's okay.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.769
I talked up this place
like it was a fuckin' Taj Mahal,

07:16.853 --> 07:19.981
and it's really just a huge dump,
and I'm really sorry.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.525
Uh, buddy, come on.
Don't beat yourself up.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.528
My fucking cousin catfished me
with this house, man.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.488
Fucking asshole.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.532
The last time I got catfished,
I promised myself,

07:29.615 --> 07:31.951
"Randy, you're never getting
fucking catfished again."

07:32.034 --> 07:37.790
And here I am, a big, fucking fat catfish
in front of a fucking disgusting pool.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.834
Hey, come on. You know what?

07:40.668 --> 07:44.130
Why don't we all go inside?
We'll unpack, settle in, relax.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.257
-That sounds good. Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.678
And then, maybe in a bit,
we can take a dip in this, huh, buddy?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.807
This water looks suspicious.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.686
No, what

07:59.353 --> 08:04.275
A little moss No.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.612
Yeah, yeah, it'll be fun.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.489
Oh, definitely.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.460
Hey.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.046
Are you mad at me?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.798
You can be mad at me. It's fine.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.345
It's not your fault.
We both got pressured into this by Randy.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.139
Randy kinda sucks right now, huh?

08:35.223 --> 08:38.851
All I wanted was for us
to have this nice weekend together.

08:40.728 --> 08:41.646
Plus, I feel like

08:41.729 --> 08:45.191
if we don't have a good time,
he's gonna have a total nervous breakdown.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.401
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.403
-I think we can do that.
-Yeah.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.822
-You stay positive, I stay positive.
-Okay.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.493
Right? We'll be a force together
and we'll ride this out, okay?

08:55.576 --> 08:58.162
Yeah, 'cause we're indestructible.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.247
We're invincible.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.707
Yeah. You're no match for us,
fuckin' Hemet.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.584
Next time I see my cousin,
I'm tackling him.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.920
This summer
is my grandma's 100th birthday,

09:06.003 --> 09:08.881
and I swear to God, I'll tackle
that fucker as soon as I see him.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.299
And I know he'll be there.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.219
I'll tackle him in front
of my whole entire fucking family, okay?

09:24.188 --> 09:26.691
Cool. What is that,
like a Bluetooth thing?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.609
Yeah, I hook up the speaker to my phone,

09:28.693 --> 09:30.653
-and I play it off my phone.
-Awesome.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.572
-Yeah.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.658
I got this little waterproof minicam.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.286
Ooh! That's awesome. We should use that.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.412
-Yeah.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.248
-We could do weird stuff underwater.
-Yeah.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.667
You did a nice job cleaning this.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.919
Yeah. It looks clean enough.

09:50.214 --> 09:53.384
-Oh! Oh!
-Shit. Shit. It's freezing. Fuck!

09:53.467 --> 09:55.011
-It's ice cold.
-Oh, fuck.

09:59.140 --> 09:59.974
Aw, fuck. Fuck.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.271
-Oh, God. Ah!
-Oh, my fucking God. Fuck!

10:05.354 --> 10:07.690
-Ah. Not so bad.
-Fuck.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.233
-I'm getting warmer.
-Fuck.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.819
Your speaker sounds really good.

10:12.403 --> 10:16.324
It's a small unit,
but it's got a really good woofer.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.994
The treble and the bass,
they blend really evenly.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.873
It's all about EQ. God damn, fuck me!

10:24.665 --> 10:29.378
I feel bad for Randy. He's so embarrassed,
but it's kind of no big deal, right?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.964
I mean, it's kind of like glamping, right?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.008
It's all good.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.010
Plus I feel like
I shit-talk Randy too much,

10:36.093 --> 10:37.178
so I'll try and pull back.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.180
Okay, thanks.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.686
Now you do me.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.021
Okay.

10:52.902 --> 10:53.861
That felt funny.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.782
Hello

10:58.866 --> 11:01.202
Hi, sir. Can we... can we help you?

11:01.285 --> 11:05.206
Maybe you could turn down
your insufferable fucking music?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.083
Oh.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.127
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was so loud.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.463
-I can hear you down in my workshop.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.923
Know where my workshop is?

11:14.423 --> 11:17.635
It's in the goddamn basement,
so I would say it's too loud!

11:18.594 --> 11:19.512
What's going on in your basement?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.806
Making a skinsuit out
of a bunch of runaway girls?

11:21.889 --> 11:22.932
Randy, shut up.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.894
This neighborhood
is not gonna put up with your bullshit!

11:26.977 --> 11:30.147
It's still too loud. Turn it down!

11:30.731 --> 11:33.943
It's okay. It's at a two!

11:34.026 --> 11:35.820
Well, then turn it to a one!

11:36.695 --> 11:38.614
What are you doing swimming anyway?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.283
I mean, this ain't Grindr.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.712
<i>I know what I did seems </i>
<i>crazy, but I felt like I was on a train </i>

11:53.796 --> 11:55.089

It sounds like it's good.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.008
<i></i>
It is.

11:58.092 --> 11:58.968
Yeah.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.889
I know it's pretty static-y,
but I'm proud I got it working, huh?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.224
<i>What</i>

12:05.307 --> 12:07.435
Can you be quiet?
I'm trying to watch it.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.187
<i>Mom, I've got to be more than just a... </i>

12:10.271 --> 12:11.605
<i>There's an oozing in there, too.</i>

12:11.689 --> 12:15.192
<i>Damn it! We could order new matchbooks?</i>

12:15.276 --> 12:17.111
<i>-Liz, you're just not...</i>

12:17.194 --> 12:19.947
Maybe you could have swallowed the Jell-O
before you drink the Pepsi?

12:20.030 --> 12:22.032
<i>-The guy's a wank.</i>

12:23.451 --> 12:26.328
<i>Okay, he's a wank. But he's a rich wank.</i>

12:30.374 --> 12:31.417
-Hey.
-Gus.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.712
Your script is really good.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.881
What? No.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.008
It's like <i>Rear Window,</i> but better.

12:39.842 --> 12:44.221
Wow, I don't hate hearing that.
That's cool.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.765
I was nervous to read it.
What if it sucked?

12:46.849 --> 12:48.642
But I would totally see this.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.394
-I'm really impressed.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.604
Aw.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.731
That's very sweet of you to say.
Thank you.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.941
I get it, though. If it'd been bad, you'd be like,

12:57.443 --> 13:00.821
"Oh, boy. I have to share this bed
with this fucking dope."

13:06.535 --> 13:07.369
You want to have sex?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.500
-Okay.
-No, it's just--

13:12.583 --> 13:14.293
-It's nothing against you.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.878
-I swear to God.
-Mm-hmm.

13:15.961 --> 13:16.879
It's not you,

13:16.962 --> 13:21.800
just the thought of being naked
on these sheets in this room

13:21.884 --> 13:25.763
with, like,
whatever's crawling around in here.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.473
Yeah, no, I understand.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.558
-I totally get it.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.851
Okay.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
-I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.699
Just take care of business, pee-wise.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.952
Be right back.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.418
Just want this for Snood.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.300
Bertie. Bertie, you hear that?

14:44.383 --> 14:45.217
What?

14:45.926 --> 14:47.761
-Come on, I was asleep.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.263
Listen.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.774
Sounds like a sex moan.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.109
Why?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.581
Is that Mickey and Gus?

15:16.415 --> 15:19.877
Definitely not. Gus does not sound
that confident when he's having sex.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.634
[man and woman continue speaking
and moaning over speaker]

15:28.844 --> 15:30.846
Oh, the speaker's still on.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.809
What the fuck is going on?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.563
Gus's phone is still hooked up
to the speaker.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.276
Oh. Oh, my God.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.492
-He's skipping forward.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.118
He's almost done.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.963
[woman continues moaning
over speaker]

16:05.756 --> 16:07.466
Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.065
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.277
-No, I've been awake.

16:27.903 --> 16:28.988
Oh, you've been awake.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.199
Did you hear anything?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.910
No.

16:35.703 --> 16:40.290
You didn't hear, like,
an animal or a creature?

16:40.374 --> 16:41.750
A creature?

16:41.834 --> 16:42.876
No?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.839
Yeah, I was in the bathroom,
and I heard an animal or a creature,

16:46.922 --> 16:49.508
or like a team of creatures
or critters or something.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.969
I got scared that maybe you were scared.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.388
No, no. No creatures.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.435
Okay. All right, well...

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
-Good night.
-Good night.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.408
Man, this is what vacation is all about.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.412
I feel like a lemon floating
in a big glass of iced tea.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.128
You guys hear something?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.423
Sounds like a party. Want to go?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.842
Yeah, I'd be down for that.
That'd be cool.

17:31.925 --> 17:32.843
Let's do it.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.763
Oh, I don't know.
If we're not invited, it might be rude.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.974
Okay, let's go.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.065
-Hey.
-Come on, Randy, let's go.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.109
Hey, one of you guys has
to fish me out of here.

17:50.069 --> 17:50.944
Bertie.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.280
Just use your arms and legs.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.740
No, I need a stick.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.825
Hi, great to see you.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.826
-Hi.
-Hello. Hi.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.162
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.998
-This is good.
-This seems like good people.

18:03.916 --> 18:07.086
Hi. Are y'all here to deliver the ice?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.713
Oh, no, no, we're here for the party.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.965
Oh, you are, okay.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.759
And how do you, um, know Ellen?

18:14.426 --> 18:17.346
Ellen. We're such fans of Ellen.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.264
Oh. Well, aren't we all, right?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.060
-Hi, I'm Holly.
Hi.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.103
Hi.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.606
So, listen. Make yourselves at home.
There's some appetizers over there.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.110
And if you need anything,
just holler for Holly.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.736
-Oh!

18:32.820 --> 18:34.113
It's fun, isn't it?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.615
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Oh, Sheryl!

18:38.325 --> 18:39.993
-Let's go.
-Great.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.246
So, um, we should just go, right?

18:42.329 --> 18:45.666
I feel like Holly's put a lot of effort
into making this event happen.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.878
Let's just stay for a little bit, please?
You could say whatever you want.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.589
Pretend to be somebody else,
see what happens. Who cares?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.342
Oh, shit, yes. Air conditioning.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.595
That may be the fun "Mickey" way
to do things,

18:58.679 --> 19:01.306
but as I've told you before,
I'm a very bad liar.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.893
What I'd like to do is to leave this place
and go back to the house

19:04.977 --> 19:05.936
and get drunk there.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.690
Bertie, calm down, it's fine.
Everyone lies in America.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.235
Holly's a liar.
Trust me, nobody is that happy.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.279
Gus, come on.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.828
Um, just so you know,
you're getting a lot of looks.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.038
Let me just stand here
for a second.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.957
Feels like a snowman is sitting
on my face.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.419
Cool.
Oh, they're already talking to people.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.381
Could we go hide in a corner somewhere?
I really hate it here.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.634
Oh, come on, Bertie-bear,
let's have fun with it.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.761
Like Mickey said,
we can pretend to be other people.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.848
Fine.

19:42.931 --> 19:46.894
I've always wanted to be in the arts,
so I'm gonna say I'm a hairstylist.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.437
Perfect.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.355
-Let's get a drink.
-Okay.

19:50.898 --> 19:51.732
No, it's true.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.567
There is no bigger defender
of the Second Amendment,

19:53.650 --> 19:56.111
or the rights of the unborn
than Judge Gow.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.405
Uh, Judge Gow?

19:58.989 --> 19:59.990
Judge Ellen Gow.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.242
She's retiring, that's why we're all here?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.785
-Yes, of course.
-He's confused,

20:03.869 --> 20:06.079
because we always call her Ellen.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.749
She's real silly,
and people don't know that about her.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.125
No.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.296
When we're hanging out we have to say,
"Hey, order in the court for you, lady."

20:14.379 --> 20:17.758
-I've never seen that side of her.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.010
No, I clerked for her.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.221
-Wow.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.306
Yes! That's where my brother and I live.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.891
Yeah.

20:25.974 --> 20:29.645
How nice. That's great.
-Yeah. We both live in San Diego.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.562
Love San Diego.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.898
It's great when you live in a city
with your sibling.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.608
You always have somebody
to go to dinner with.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.235
-Yeah.
That's true.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.281
Yeah. It's so great. He's my baby brother,
but now we're best friends.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.658
That's so lovely.

20:42.741 --> 20:43.575
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.119
-I know. We used to fight so much...
-Oh, my gosh.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.538
Now, fightin's the last thing we do.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.998
Yeah.
-Oh, wow.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.709
What is it you two do?
What's your line of work?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.961
Uh, hedge funds.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.381
Oh. What is that? It's always over
my head. What's a hedge fund?

20:57.464 --> 21:03.512
Um, so, basically, let's say you have
a lot of money that you want to invest.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.266
Your judge money that you win
in your court battles

21:07.349 --> 21:10.310
or if you sell flower dresses.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.145
It's a whole thing.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.063
It's complicated.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.275
But can I just say,
you have got a gorgeous head of hair.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.861
It is really lush, and full,
and it looks beautiful. I love it.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.115
I agree. It's some
of the best volume in hair

21:23.198 --> 21:26.118
that I've ever seen
on a woman of your stature.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.286
Which is a good stature.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.579
And I should know what I'm talking about,

21:29.663 --> 21:32.582
because I'm actually
a celebrity hairstylist.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.002
Tina Arena, ever heard of her?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.170
You might not have,
because she's mainly in Australia.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.589
But she's also very popular in France.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.467
And she's got beautiful hair, like you.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.095
And she's tough to work with sometimes.

21:45.178 --> 21:48.598
But you get the scissors out,
and she knows who's boss. It's me.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.392
It's a wig.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.811
-Oh, my God.
-Um...

21:52.894 --> 21:55.856
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.984
We're both really sorry, so we'll just go.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.527
Thank you for the party.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.070
Sorry about everything. Goodbye.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.532
-And I said, "I feel kind of unsafe..."
-I'm so sorry.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.326
"...without knowing
if there's a gun in the room."

22:07.409 --> 22:09.244
-We'll meet you at the house.
-Oh. No.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.079
Sorry, bye. Wait! Wait! What's wrong?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.999
I feel like a jerk. You made me a jerk.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.959
I didn't want to do this,
and you pushed me,

22:16.043 --> 22:17.961
and now I'm a jerk. Jerk.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.212
I'm sorry. I...

22:19.296 --> 22:21.340
It was supposed to be fun.
Nobody got hurt.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.091
Feelings were hurt, Mickey.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.469
Ugh, whatever. I want
to go back to the dumb house

22:25.552 --> 22:26.970
and take off this stupid bra.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.972
No, Bertie.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.933
Just say
you don't like the house, Bertie.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.062
Randy, who gives a shit at this point?

22:35.145 --> 22:38.106
I know you don't. Say it's a letdown.
It's worse when you pretend.

22:38.190 --> 22:44.154
Fine. This house
is a huge fucking letdown.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.907
-Okay. Harsh.
-No.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.242
You asked me to.
You told me to do that.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.786
You begged me to say what I thought.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.624
Well, the fact that you said it
after the fact's much worse.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.585
Oh, my God, you are such a fucking baby.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.463
Bertie, I have a rule that I don't go
to bed angry,

23:02.214 --> 23:03.673
but you leave me no choice.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.093
Good night.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.262
Sweet dreams.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.900
What? Oh...

23:21.983 --> 23:23.026
Oh...

23:23.110 --> 23:26.404
Randy? I've got some weird bites
on my arm.

23:26.488 --> 23:30.450
-It's nothing. Go back to sleepy.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.411
Oh, my God,
there's a big fucking lizard in here!

23:33.495 --> 23:35.956
Yeah, it's supposed to be here.
We're in the desert.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.958
-This is their world, not ours.
-Oh, my God,

23:38.041 --> 23:40.293
do I have fucking lizard bites on my arm?

23:40.877 --> 23:42.420
A lizard wouldn't bite your arm.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.923
They go after something meatier,
like your leg.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.300
It's probably just a spider or a tick.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.886
Why did you bring me
to this place full of vermin?

23:50.262 --> 23:54.641
I don't think those are vermin, actually.
I think vermin have to be mammals.

23:55.517 --> 23:59.354
Why can't you just be
a good boyfriend for once?

24:00.647 --> 24:03.692
I'm an awesome boyfriend.
Maybe the problem is your standards.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.820
Bertie. Bertie, I really am sorry.

24:06.903 --> 24:10.407
This will go so much better for you
if you leave me alone right now.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.242
I'm trying to apologize.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.786
Look. I'm really sorry, okay?
Come here, give me a hug.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.622
No! I need to not see your face
for 20 fucking minutes.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.041
You're always next to me.
Let me freak out.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.627
Wow.
-Yes.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.920
-You're always in my space.
-This is awful.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.089
-This is amazing.
-You never give me any time alone.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.507
You're always at my house.

24:27.591 --> 24:32.804
Wow. Fuck. Wait, hold on, Mickey,
do I spend too much time at your place?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.432
Oh... I feel like
this is a you-and-Bertie thing.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.684
Oh, no, tell him if you have an opinion.
Go for it.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.561
You're at our place a lot. Yeah.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.647
-Fuck you, Mickey!
-Hey! Dude! Don't say "fuck you" to her!

24:42.731 --> 24:45.650
I put together
this fuckin' awesome weekend for you guys,

24:45.734 --> 24:47.819
and then you come
at me like a fucking asshole.

24:47.903 --> 24:54.242
You want me to thank you for bringing us
to this shithole? This place sucks!

24:54.326 --> 24:57.162
Hey! Only I'm allowed to tell Randy
this place sucks.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.915
Hey, Randy, this place sucks!

24:59.998 --> 25:02.876
And I knew it was gonna suck
as soon as you started talking about it.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.419
We should go.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.046
-Let's get out of here.
-Yeah...

25:06.129 --> 25:07.255
Oh! I'm sorry, Mickey.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.342
Someone else gets a bit dramatic,
and you can't handle it?

25:10.425 --> 25:13.887
All I wanted was for us
to have a weekend by ourselves,

25:13.970 --> 25:16.806
and somehow we still got stuck
with you two!

25:16.890 --> 25:19.434
That's fucking bullshit.
Gus, help me out here.

25:19.517 --> 25:23.313
-You know, I'd rather not get involved.
-That's fucking typical.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.190
You haven't had my back
since you started dating Mickey.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.192
Okay, why don't you deal with Bertie?

25:27.275 --> 25:29.319
Deal with Bertie?
Deal with this, you fuckwit.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.445
Hey, you're the fuckwit.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.363
-Hey!
Hey!

25:31.446 --> 25:34.908
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you, Gus.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.160
You're in our house as much as Randy is.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.705
You always take the good parking spot.
You always leave your jacket on the couch.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.250
And I hear you having sex all the time.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.878
"Oh, I'm gonna cum.
I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum."

25:47.462 --> 25:49.089
Just fucking cum already.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.758
What makes you take you so fucking long?

25:51.841 --> 25:54.177
Are you sick

25:54.261 --> 25:55.679
What's going on, Gus?

25:55.762 --> 25:58.306
Why do you have to build it up
for so fucking long?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.935
It's not the next fucking <i>Star Wars</i> movie,
you nerd!

26:02.018 --> 26:06.106
Oh, and by the way, we all heard you
jacking off to porn last night.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.315
Oh, Bertie,

26:07.399 --> 26:10.485
-I told you--
-And guess what. It sounded gross.

26:10.568 --> 26:14.948
Okay, so what? I was watching porn.
But it's not like I was jacking off.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.536
You weren't jacking off?
That's so much fucking weirder!

26:19.619 --> 26:21.204
Fuck all of you!

26:21.288 --> 26:23.290
No, Bertie!

26:32.549 --> 26:33.508
Oh, God.

You okay, buddy?

27:13.214 --> 27:15.008
I just want to fly my drone
before we leave.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.344
-Okay.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.390
Wow.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.771
Are there rules,
like when it becomes a spacecraft?

27:27.854 --> 27:30.690
I don't think it ever becomes
a "spacecraft."

27:30.774 --> 27:32.525
Uh, no, it does, actually.

27:33.318 --> 27:38.490
It can't go above, like, 400 or 500 feet
before it's designated a spacecraft.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.950
Or maybe five miles.

27:49.459 --> 27:53.338
Bertie, I want to film this thing,
where it starts really high up,

27:53.421 --> 27:55.298
where you can see all the trees and...

27:55.382 --> 27:57.675
-I think it's gonna...
-Oh, shit.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.262
You see the mountains and the trees

28:01.346 --> 28:03.848
and then it slowly comes back down

28:03.932 --> 28:05.725
-to Earth and...
-Shit. It's still...

28:06.851 --> 28:10.855
You see the two of us,
and we're softly kissing each other.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.566
Then it was gonna come up really close
to our faces,

28:13.650 --> 28:17.862
and I was working on the special effects
where it could go inside of our bodies.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.614
And it would, like, go down within us,

28:19.698 --> 28:23.368
and you'd see our stomachs
and our guts and our innards.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.869
Then you'd see my heart.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.956
And it was beating faster,
because I was kissing you.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.794
I don't want to do that now, thank you.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.840
-It's still...
-Oh, shit.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.054
Oh, shit!
-What the fuck!

28:43.138 --> 28:45.098
Let me tell you losers something.

28:46.099 --> 28:50.103
I got a right to protect my property
and the airspace up above it.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.105
Hey, asshole. You shot my drone.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.190
How the hell do I know what was
in that drone?

28:55.066 --> 28:57.360
They make drones today to kill people.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.781
I watch the news. I know Saudi Arabia.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.993
That's very unrelated
to what's happening here.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.120
Yeah, dude, I feel like
you're being unreasonable.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.874
-I will fuck you up.
-Okay.

29:10.957 --> 29:11.791
All right. -Okay!
-Okay.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.210
You get the hell out of here.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.463
-Yes.
-And good Shabbos, fuckers.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.047
Great.
Oh, my God.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.841
Jesus!
We should go.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.552
-I want to go home.
I'm with Gus, let's go.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.973
Wait till I move the suitcase
before you make the bed.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.475
Knock, knock, knock. Hey.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.769
-Hi. Oh, very ready.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.896
-Never more so.
-Yeah, we're packed.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.149
Um, don't steal towels
if you were gonna do that.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.860
I don't-- We weren't gonna do that.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.530
Randy, I know things kind of got weird
at the end,

29:42.614 --> 29:45.325
but I just want to say,
um, thanks for having us.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.786
Yeah, no problem.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.332
Okay, I've been thinking.

29:52.415 --> 29:55.835
It's not fair to let that asshole neighbor
run us out of town, right?

29:56.503 --> 30:00.089
We deserve to have fun
for one second of this trip,

30:00.173 --> 30:01.966
or it'll suck forever in our memory.  Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.512
Okay.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.222
What are we supposed to do?

30:07.305 --> 30:09.182
Well, do you still have those fireworks?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.851
Oh, shit.
Go! Is it lighted?

30:11.935 --> 30:13.812
I don't know.
-Oh, my God!

30:14.437 --> 30:17.941
-Oh, my God! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

30:18.024 --> 30:19.984
Oh, my God! Oh!

30:20.068 --> 30:21.694
Oh, my God! Go!

30:21.778 --> 30:23.780
-Go! Oh, my God!

30:26.157 --> 30:29.160
Hey! What the hell do you think
you're doing?

30:29.702 --> 30:34.332
-I'll get you! I swear to God I will!
-Oh, my fucking God!

30:34.415 --> 30:36.292
Oh, my God.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.210
Whew!

30:40.713 --> 30:41.548
Wow.

30:43.132 --> 30:46.135
-You could have blown your hand off.
Relax.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.013
Is it cool if I stay
at your place tonight?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.266
Randy, what was I just talking about?

30:51.349 --> 30:54.811
I know, but, look, I don't want
to go back right to my place,

30:54.894 --> 30:56.312
and then, you know...

30:58.815 --> 31:00.358
We should spend
the night together, Bertie...
