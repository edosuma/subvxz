00:01.936 --> 00:04.236
(mysterious music)

00:45.279 --> 00:46.978
- Consider this my resignation.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.550
I'm no longer detective murdoch
of station house number four.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.819
- Mathilda crisp.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.286
She is my ward
and she is missing.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.922
I need her found.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.823
- I don't think your aunt
is sick at all.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.426
- She brings me across
the atlantic for conversation?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.962
- Stop!
(grunting)

01:04.031 --> 01:06.698
- The anarchists are my friends.
They would never betray me.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.366
<i> (julia): Sometimes</i>
<i> a million dollars can make</i>

01:08.402 --> 01:10.102
<i> People betray their friends.</i>

01:10.104 --> 01:12.638
- But, look, right here,
it appears as though

01:12.773 --> 01:15.006
They are abducting her.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.375
- Is she lying?

01:16.377 --> 01:18.376
- You're a very clever man.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.145
Didn't I tell you
he was a clever man?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.380
- Good work, mr. Murdoch.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.449
- Julia?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.184
- Please, we have
a child at home.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.520
- As long as you cooperate,
your child will remain safe.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.787
- No, you-you can't--
- no!

01:29.824 --> 01:30.923
(zapping)

01:31.058 --> 01:32.191
(grunting)

01:32.193 --> 01:33.725
(crabtree):
Is the inspector there?

01:33.727 --> 01:36.528
Tell him the detective
and his wife have gone missing.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.729
I don't know where they are.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.997
(julia): Are we moving?

01:39.066 --> 01:41.500
Help! Help!

01:44.838 --> 01:47.239
(indistinct chatter)

01:58.285 --> 02:00.152
- Still no news of the murdochs?

02:00.154 --> 02:00.953
- Nothing.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.421
- You'll find them.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.891
- I'm not so sure, effie.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.293
It's been two weeks.
Just not a clue.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.696
I never should have
taken this inspector job.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.097
It was a terrible idea.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.632
- George...

02:13.767 --> 02:16.434
I'd wager there's nobody
better for the position.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.970
(door opens)

02:18.105 --> 02:19.504
- I highly doubt that.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.910
- I've got something.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.111
- What is it?

02:26.180 --> 02:28.446
- I found one of the anarchists.
He's in the cells.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.648
- I'll be right there.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.450
- Looks like
your luck's changing.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.420
(indistinct chatter)

02:36.857 --> 02:38.590
- I'll reserve judgement
on that for now.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.759
Crabtree...

02:43.030 --> 02:44.429
- What am I doing here?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.931
- I just have a couple
of questions.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.399
- So you threw me in a cell?

02:47.468 --> 02:50.969
- Constable higgins got a little
overeager. I apologize.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.073
- Not that I'll tell
you anything,

02:55.075 --> 02:57.742
But... What do you
want to know?

03:00.114 --> 03:02.114
<i>(crabtree): You attended a rally</i>
<i> a couple of weeks ago.</i>

03:02.249 --> 03:04.349
<i> There was a young woman</i>
<i> burning money.</i>

03:04.418 --> 03:05.584
(whistles blowing)

03:05.586 --> 03:07.352
<i> There was a fight between</i>
<i> you lot and the police.</i>

03:09.156 --> 03:10.222
(echoing gunshot)

03:10.224 --> 03:11.689
<i>The young woman fled the scene.</i>

03:11.725 --> 03:13.024
<i> What was her name?</i>

03:13.060 --> 03:14.626
(indistinct shouting)

03:15.563 --> 03:16.828
- Why should I tell you?

03:16.964 --> 03:19.298
- Because if you don't, I'll
throw you back in the cells.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.666
- On what charges?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.034
- Oh, I'll think of something.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.268
- You can't just--

03:23.304 --> 03:24.903
- I can be a little
overeager myself.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.973
Now you'd best just speak.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.909
(sighs)

03:31.044 --> 03:33.144
- Her name was mathilda crisp.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.049
- Where can I find her?

03:38.686 --> 03:40.185
(crows cawing)

03:42.656 --> 03:44.990
- Well, I've been through
the entire property.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.325
There's no one here
and I'd wager

03:46.460 --> 03:47.925
That's been the case
for some time.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.060
- No one?

03:49.096 --> 03:50.862
- No personal effects either.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.330
- I need to know who lived here.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.532
Henry, city records.
- On it.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.736
- Crabtree.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.539
- It's inspector crabtree.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.407
- Yeah, inspector.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.608
As you like.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.211
You might want to take
a look at this.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.948
(soft curious music)

04:12.419 --> 04:13.352
- Ugh...

04:22.763 --> 04:24.496
(watts): Any idea what this is?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.497
- I believe that belongs
to detective murdoch.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.766
It's part of a-a...

04:27.835 --> 04:31.036
A device he invented,
a weaponized capacitor.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.538
- So, did the detective
kill this poor chap?

04:34.842 --> 04:36.675
- If he did, I'm sure he had
justifiable reason.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.711
It doesn't answer the question
as to where he is now.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.585
(keys jingling)

04:46.587 --> 04:48.720
(soft instrumental music)

05:04.405 --> 05:05.437
- Welcome.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.004
- Where are we?

05:07.041 --> 05:08.540
And why have you
brought us here?

05:08.542 --> 05:09.741
- All in good time.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.943
- I demand to know
where our child is!

05:13.347 --> 05:15.413
- Neither you nor your husband
are in a position

05:15.549 --> 05:16.281
To demand anything.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.151
Now, I'll let you
get cleaned up.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.887
We have work to do.

05:33.166 --> 05:33.898
- Detective.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.369
The home is under the name
of a lionel bentley.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.636
He's the dead man.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.571
- The anarchist mentioned
a mathilda crisp.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.641
- Yes. Mr. Bentley
was her legal guardian.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.242
- So she lived here?

05:44.278 --> 05:45.777
Henry, honestly!

05:47.981 --> 05:50.248
- And what about their
daughter, susannah?

05:50.384 --> 05:52.517
- I don't know where she is.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.786
I hope to god she's with them.
- Hmm.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.057
- Where is she?
- She's safe.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.392
- Where?!

06:00.394 --> 06:02.126
- You'll find out in due time.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.528
- I want to know now!

06:03.663 --> 06:05.530
- Your concerns are not mine.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.432
- What do you want from us?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.569
- I need to save an innocent
woman from the noose.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.004
And you two
are the ones to do it.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.607
(julia scoffs)
- this is ridiculous. Let us go.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.875
- You're free to leave.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.676
You can say goodbye
to your daughter.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.613
- We will go to the authorities!

06:21.682 --> 06:24.349
- Again, you are free to make
whatever choice you want,

06:24.484 --> 06:27.786
But the wrong one
will seal your child's fate.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.689
- I--
- julia! Julia!

06:32.192 --> 06:35.660
- I understand your fury,
but it changes nothing.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.999
- Where is this woman?

06:42.335 --> 06:44.035
(indistinct chatter)

06:44.071 --> 06:45.503
- Just because
we're working together

06:45.639 --> 06:46.771
It doesn't mean I like you.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.574
- Doesn't matter much to me.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.244
- Don't know why inspector
crabtree kept you on.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.912
- Just proof of his
good judgement.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.514
(sighs)
- paul.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.983
- You might want
to prepare yourself.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.452
- It's one person?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.186
- It would appear so.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.721
- Any identification?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.790
- You're joking, right?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.191
- Who found the body?

07:06.326 --> 07:09.928
- I did. Covered what was
left out of decency.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.730
- Good man.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.065
Let's get it back to the morgue.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.201
- I hope george is up to this.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.002
- So do I.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.737
We could dearly use
the inspector, though.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.845
(soft instrumental music)

07:39.893 --> 07:42.093
- We really should have told
your aunt we were leaving.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.562
- I'm sure she'll be
well aware by now.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.898
- Still, leaving in
the middle of the night?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.300
- Murdoch and julia are missing.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.902
That matters more than
my aunt's feelings.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.504
Besides, she'd more than likely
feign a heart attack

07:53.540 --> 07:55.507
To get us to stay.
(laughing)

07:56.910 --> 07:57.742
(captain roberts): Lovely day.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.610
- It is.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.312
- Now this is the way to travel.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.447
- Is it?

08:02.449 --> 08:04.715
- It's more pleasurable
than traveling by train.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.450
- Lot bloody slower, though.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.819
When are we due to arrive?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.989
- Twenty-four hours from now.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.457
- So, another day with this lot.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.493
- And after all of that,
I simply had no choice

08:15.628 --> 08:17.095
But to tell the fellow
to take a flying leap!

08:17.230 --> 08:20.198
(laughing)
oh, uh, my apologies, ladies.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.001
- I'm sure he said it
out of earshot.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.803
- I doubt he says
much out of earshot.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.005
(laughing)

08:27.140 --> 08:29.073
- Oh! Mr. Brackenreid,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.142
Are you sure you won't
join us for a drink?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.143
- No, thank you.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.812
- Well, that's a first.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.617
- I just want to get back
to toronto and find murdoch.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.518
- It's a shame the captain
won't let us drop a line.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.754
I caught a sturgeon
in this river once.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.355
Half a ton if it was an ounce.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.824
Beast put up a whale of a fight.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.659
(chuckling)
- very clever.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.161
- Oh, oh! I see. Whale.
(chuckles)

08:50.297 --> 08:51.730
Sometimes I even
surprise myself.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.531
(laughing)

08:53.534 --> 08:55.433
- Just one, mr. Brackenreid?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.668
I swear I won't bite.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.704
But I am a terrible liar.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.311
- She has some nerve,
doesn't she?

09:06.313 --> 09:08.513
- Let's just get home, margaret.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.254
(indistinct chatter)

09:20.661 --> 09:23.895
- Well, this is delightful.
And when was this found?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.930
- According to
constable higgins,

09:25.966 --> 09:27.799
Three hours ago.
Discovered in a park

09:27.801 --> 09:29.333
Near jarvis street.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.137
I need you to determine
a cause of death.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.406
- It seems rather apparent;
wouldn't you say so?

09:34.541 --> 09:37.875
- Hmm. A time. Anything.
(door opens)

09:37.945 --> 09:39.210
- I'll do what I can.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.947
- Miss hart, there you are.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.949
You can't avoid me.
This needs to be dealt with.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.484
- And I will deal with it.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.385
- Now.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.921
- Excuse me,
what is your business here?

09:50.056 --> 09:51.589
- My name is william harwell.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.625
I represent the family
of arthur carmichael

09:53.760 --> 09:55.393
In a civil proceeding.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.895
- Well, miss hart
is assisting

09:57.931 --> 09:59.297
In a grave police matter.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.499
Perhaps you could return
at a more appropriate time?

10:01.568 --> 10:03.000
- I will not!

10:03.036 --> 10:04.603
- All right.
Well, if you'd like,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.404
I could charge you
with interfering

10:06.473 --> 10:08.306
In a police investigation.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.242
- Miss hart, I demand your
attention on this matter!

10:16.316 --> 10:17.649
- Thank you, llewellyn.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.488
(somber piano music)

10:39.839 --> 10:42.707
- Ah, so you're finally here.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.809
Well, let them in, jeffrey.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.978
(keys jingle)

10:48.081 --> 10:49.414
(lock clicks)

11:02.996 --> 11:04.229
Do sit down.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.500
Apologies for the china,

11:08.502 --> 11:11.302
But one has to make do,
I suppose.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.572
Oh, how appalling!

11:14.708 --> 11:17.042
Let me introduce myself:

11:17.177 --> 11:18.109
Hilda fanshaw.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.380
Yes, well, I suppose
I ought to apologize

11:22.515 --> 11:25.383
For my methods, too, but...

11:25.518 --> 11:29.354
Desperate times call for
desperate measures, do they not?

11:29.356 --> 11:33.991
And given that I am to meet
my maker in three days,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.161
These are indeed
desperate times.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.196
- What do you want from us?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.931
- Didn't atticus tell you?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.733
I want you to save my life.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.003
- You're convicted
of your husband's murder?

11:45.138 --> 11:48.306
- Indeed I am. Poor frederick.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.074
- Did you do it?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.676
- The courts believe I did.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.210
- That's not an answer.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.612
(scoffs)
- it's the only one

11:54.681 --> 11:55.880
That matters.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.816
(sighs)

11:57.818 --> 11:59.517
- What do you propose we do?

12:00.487 --> 12:03.221
- Overturn my conviction.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.224
Get me out of this dreary place.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.526
- How would we do that?

12:09.663 --> 12:12.363
- You and your wife...

12:12.365 --> 12:16.367
Are experts in the field
of criminal detection.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.170
Find someone other than myself

12:19.206 --> 12:21.339
Responsible for the murder
of my husband.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.374
- Even though you did it?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.643
- I never said that.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.179
- We will do no such thing.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.650
- Oh, well, it is your choice,
of course.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.820
But you have been made
aware of the consequences.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.258
I'm already doomed to die.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.595
So, unlike you,

12:43.730 --> 12:45.764
I have very little to lose.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.066
(tense music)

12:55.942 --> 12:58.910
- That is arnauld's watch.
And his eyeglasses.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.547
- Your husband was the owner
of lepage fabrications?

13:02.682 --> 13:03.481
- Yes.

13:04.518 --> 13:05.783
Who would have
done this to him?

13:06.820 --> 13:08.819
- Well, that's where
we're hoping

13:08.855 --> 13:10.154
You might be of some assistance.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.157
Did your husband
have any enemies?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.558
- Everyone in business
has an enemy.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.561
Arnauld was no exception.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.362
- Anyone in particular?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.032
- Oh, well...

13:22.368 --> 13:24.235
Arnauld bought out his partner,
russell wilson,

13:24.370 --> 13:25.904
Two years ago.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.573
It was what he called
a hostile takeover.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.707
- I see.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.910
- But no one he knew
could have done this.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.914
(crying)
whoever did this was not human.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.984
(tense music)

13:43.256 --> 13:44.656
(whispering): We need
to go to the police.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.391
- And tell them what?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.125
- That we've been kidnapped.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.660
Th-that our child is being held.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.729
- No! I won't put susannah's
life in danger, william!

13:51.798 --> 13:53.398
- I'm afraid it already is.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.066
- We just need to get that woman
out of jail

13:55.135 --> 13:56.868
And deal with
the consequences later.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.003
- How?

13:59.005 --> 14:02.807
- Like she said, we wrote
a bloody book about murder.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.542
Let's just do what it
takes to get her out!

14:04.677 --> 14:05.810
(distant shouting)

14:07.948 --> 14:10.114
- Let's examine the evidence
they have against her.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.688
- It's an honour.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.357
The esteemed detective
william murdoch!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.693
- Thank you.
- And what brings you here?

14:21.828 --> 14:25.263
- We're looking into the matter
of hilda fanshaw.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.099
- To what end?
- We believe she may

14:28.168 --> 14:30.101
Have been wrongly convicted.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.170
- I'm not sure that's the case.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.704
Over the last few years,
we've been summoned

14:33.740 --> 14:35.606
To the fanshaw home
on numerous occasions.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.807
- For what reason?

14:36.843 --> 14:40.111
- Various disputes
of a, uh, domestic nature.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.581
- Have there been any arrests?
- There were not.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.116
Neither wanted the attention
of the public

14:45.185 --> 14:46.718
Into their affairs.
- Mm.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.319
But you believe
her to be responsible

14:48.454 --> 14:49.854
For her husband's death.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.390
- Given their history,
she was our primary suspect.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.325
I also discovered
the poison to kill her husband

14:54.361 --> 14:56.861
In her possession.
- In her possession?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.797
- Well, in her room.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.433
And why would
a canadian policeman

15:02.568 --> 15:03.668
Be interested in any of this?

15:03.803 --> 15:06.070
- Oh! Uh, well,
you may not be aware,

15:06.106 --> 15:09.407
But I am no longer a member
of the toronto constabulary.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.208
- We've been hired
by mrs. Fanshaw

15:11.278 --> 15:14.478
To investigate the details
of her conviction.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.214
- And you find her version
of events credible?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.618
- Uh, we wouldn't have taken
the case otherwise.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.954
- We may need to have
a look at your case file.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.589
- Any assistance I can offer.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.724
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.159
- I'm going to be sick.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.929
- We do what we need to do.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.964
(curious music)

15:40.674 --> 15:43.374
- And how are we proceeding with
the murder of arnauld lepage?

15:43.509 --> 15:45.443
- Well, we've just begun
the investigation.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.044
- Has there been any progress?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.646
- Not as of yet,
but we're hopeful.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.048
- Find out who did this.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.517
Mr. Lepage was
an important member

15:52.652 --> 15:54.051
Of the toronto
business community.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.054
His murder is your
number one priority.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.789
- Yes, sir.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.858
Well, you heard the man.
- Of course.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.794
- Did you find out anything
about the business partner?

16:02.796 --> 16:05.329
- Ah, yes. He is holidaying
in paris, France;

16:05.365 --> 16:07.598
Has been for
the last two months.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.133
- Right.
Then, for the time being,

16:09.169 --> 16:11.269
We'll eliminate his involvement.
Henry!

16:11.271 --> 16:13.070
Why don't you take miss hart
to the park

16:13.139 --> 16:14.271
Where lepage's body was found?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.740
Perhaps that could help
drum up a clue.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.207
- Absolutely. I was just
about to step out

16:17.243 --> 16:18.542
For lunch, though.
- Well, you could have

16:18.578 --> 16:20.278
Your lunch when
you get back, henry.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.579
(sighs)
- fine.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.019
- I would say it's unlikely
that he was killed here.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.688
- Would have made for quite
a spectacle if he was.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.024
- I found traces of engine oil
and lubricants

16:33.159 --> 16:34.559
On what was left of his body.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.627
- Hmm. Not something
that a factory owner

16:36.629 --> 16:38.295
Would come in contact with.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.498
- But something
a factory worker would.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.433
- Think one of his employees
killed him?

16:42.469 --> 16:45.369
- Well, I can't answer that,
but it'd be worth investigating.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.106
- Well, I guess we know
where detective watts

16:48.108 --> 16:49.974
Should head next.
Thank you, miss hart.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.776
Oh! Uh...

16:51.778 --> 16:53.844
Ruthie mentioned
that you may be having

16:53.913 --> 16:55.146
Legal difficulties.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.049
- And what business of yours
or your wife's

16:58.051 --> 16:59.517
Would it be if I were?

16:59.652 --> 17:03.054
- Oh, I only mean to say that
if you ever need any help--

17:03.189 --> 17:05.189
- Thank you, constable higgins.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.791
But I'll be just fine.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.125
I always am.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.396
(soft music)

17:20.940 --> 17:22.273
(brackenreid): Thank you.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.074
(overlapping chatter)

17:24.110 --> 17:26.911
- Oh. Come join us.
There's room for one more.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.046
- Ah, no, thank you.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.482
- Are you sure? You could
play my hand with me.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.218
- No, thank you.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.053
- Well, that's a shame.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.989
- What are you doing!?
- Are you talking to me?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.858
- You dealt from
the bottom of the deck.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.593
- He did not!
- You stay out of this.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.095
I saw it with my own eyes.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.165
You, sir, step back
from the table.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.300
- I will not!
- Gentlemen, please.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.068
- You want me to step
away from the table?

17:51.137 --> 17:52.837
I'll step away from the table!
- Oh!

17:53.673 --> 17:54.705
- You step back, sir.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.074
(brackenreid):
Put that gun down!

17:56.209 --> 17:58.009
- I will not. He attacked me.
Who are you?

17:58.011 --> 17:59.477
- I'm a police officer.
Give it here!

18:00.713 --> 18:03.314
Sir, confine this gentleman
to his cabin.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.249
- What?
- You can't tell me what to do.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.751
I'm the captain of this ship.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.453
- I don't care if you're
admiral horatio bloody nelson.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.589
Confine this gentleman
to his quarters.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.293
- Preposterous.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.928
- And, you, clean up this mess.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.230
- Yes, sir.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.301
- I must say,
it's quite something

18:24.370 --> 18:27.471
Having a real man
on this vessel.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.672
It's thrilling.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.674
(sighs)
- thank you.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.811
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to finish my drink.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.790
(fanshaw): So, you've seen
the wisdom of helping me.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.792
- More the necessity.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.631
- The evidence that you killed
your husband is compelling.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.302
- Depending on from
what angle you look at it.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.606
- Well, the angle the police
took seems correct.

19:04.043 --> 19:07.144
- Can you describe your
relationship with your husband?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.581
- Oh, like most married couples,
I imagine.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.317
In love at first, but later,

19:13.452 --> 19:16.787
Simply waiting for the end
of time to arrive.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.423
- That's not most
married couples.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.560
- You will get there. Trust me.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.365
- The rochester police claim
that the two of you fought.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.666
- Indeed we did.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.402
That was many years ago.

19:31.471 --> 19:35.039
Latterly we suffered
each other in silence.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.640
- Until you killed him.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.477
- I was no longer interested
in him enough to kill him.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.112
I was simply waiting
for him to expire.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.882
- Then if not you, then who?

19:46.619 --> 19:50.154
- Did that dim-witted policeman

19:50.289 --> 19:52.390
Say anything about
a rachel wiggins?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.624
- Who is that?

19:53.759 --> 19:56.827
- Oh. I'll take that
as an answer.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.829
She was our housemaid
for a while.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.198
- Where is she now?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.300
- Haven't the foggiest.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.036
My husband dismissed her
shortly before his death.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.772
There, look at that.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.341
I have just pointed you
towards a person with motive.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.177
- Why did he let her go?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.746
- He was having
an affair with her.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.448
I suppose he tired of it.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.450
- Well, that suggests
motive on your part.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.385
(scoffs)
- that would suggest

20:21.520 --> 20:24.188
I still had feelings for him.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.023
Dear lady,
that was not the case.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.592
- Is it your contention, then,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.995
That she planted evidence

20:30.997 --> 20:32.496
To make you appear guilty?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.732
- I contend nothing.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.268
But that is certainly
a possibility.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.736
She was angry with me.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.304
(julia sighs)
- why is that?

20:41.774 --> 20:44.909
- Oh, she felt I ought to have
had sympathy for her plight.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.343
- And you did not?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.747
- Stupid naive people
get what they deserve,

20:50.783 --> 20:51.982
Don't you think?

20:54.654 --> 20:55.819
- What do you have?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.089
- I think I know where
mr. Lepage was killed.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.292
There were traces of blood
and, well,

21:01.294 --> 21:03.694
Mr. Lepage
in the gears of a machine

21:03.730 --> 21:05.296
In his fabrication plant.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.764
It would have been
capable of doing

21:06.766 --> 21:07.965
The damage we witnessed.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.500
- But no idea
who might have done it?

21:09.569 --> 21:10.634
- No.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.069
- So, could it have
been an accident?

21:12.204 --> 21:15.439
- I suppose. But, if that was
the case, why move the body?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.508
- Mm.
(phone ringing)

21:19.712 --> 21:20.844
George crabtree...

21:23.549 --> 21:24.982
Right. I'll be right there.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.053
Can you imagine there was
a time I enjoyed

21:29.122 --> 21:30.387
Hearing this thing ring?

21:34.026 --> 21:35.860
(crows cawing)

21:35.862 --> 21:38.062
- Mrs. Fanshaw
is a wonderful woman.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.996
I am glad you are here to help.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.398
- And her husband?

21:41.434 --> 21:42.833
- A decent man.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.070
- Were you here the night
that he was killed?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.604
- Sadly, I was not.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.341
- The lady and her husband
were home alone that night.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.477
Mrs. Fanshaw retired early.
She was...

21:53.479 --> 21:54.545
Under the weather.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.083
- Mr. Jones, I am speaking
with mr. Edwards at the moment.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.752
- And I know the truth
of it as well as he.

22:03.222 --> 22:06.623
- And I will get
to you in due time.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.064
So, you were not present.
Where were you?

22:13.199 --> 22:15.433
- Attending services
at the first methodist church

22:15.435 --> 22:16.633
On franklin.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.203
I returned here to find
mr. Fanshaw dead.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.571
- And hilda fanshaw?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.039
- She was asleep in her room.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.677
- What can you tell me
about this rachel wiggins?

22:27.780 --> 22:29.246
- She was dismissed
by the fanshaws

22:29.315 --> 22:31.015
Some months before
mr. Fanshaw died.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.050
- What was the reason
for her dismissal?

22:33.185 --> 22:36.119
- Oh, she made scurrilous
accusations against mr. Fanshaw.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.155
(julia): Accusations
of what nature?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.957
(tense music)

22:39.959 --> 22:43.260
- She accused mr. Fanshaw
of improper conduct,

22:43.262 --> 22:45.095
Which surely was a lie.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.866
- Do you know where she is now?

22:48.935 --> 22:49.867
- I do not.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.736
- Thank you.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.276
- Mr. Fanshaw
attacked her repeatedly

22:59.278 --> 23:00.845
And then dismissed her
without a word.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.348
If you ask me,
he deserved what he received.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.685
(tense music)

23:12.759 --> 23:14.258
- Miss hart.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.693
- Uh, you best not uncover
it here, inspector.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.566
- Oh, good lord.

23:22.701 --> 23:23.834
What happened?

23:23.836 --> 23:24.835
- He's been flayed.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.438
- My god.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.074
What's this?

23:30.209 --> 23:33.510
(watts): I believe
it is called a sandblaster.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.714
- It's used to remove paint
or rust from metal.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.583
Judging by the condition
of the victim,

23:39.718 --> 23:41.452
I'd assume the assailant
used it on him.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.187
- Oh, good gracious.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.190
- So?

23:46.325 --> 23:47.591
(crabtree): So what?

23:47.660 --> 23:50.727
- So, what would you have
us do, inspector?

23:50.797 --> 23:54.098
- Right. Well, um,
get the body to the morgue.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.733
- Wagon's on the way.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.701
Perhaps it's best we get
everyone out of here?

23:59.138 --> 24:01.705
- Right. Lads, clear the area.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.640
(indistinct chatter)

24:03.709 --> 24:05.409
- You know what this means?

24:05.544 --> 24:07.478
- These two murders
are connected.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.420
(banging)

24:16.555 --> 24:17.621
(snoring)

24:17.623 --> 24:18.755
(banging)

24:18.791 --> 24:20.424
(captain roberts):
Inspector brackenreid!

24:20.559 --> 24:21.692
(banging)

24:21.761 --> 24:23.627
Inspector brackenreid,
wake up!

24:23.629 --> 24:25.429
(snoring)

24:25.564 --> 24:27.097
(banging)
inspector brackenreid!

24:27.133 --> 24:30.301
- Oh, yes. Oh, I'm coming.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.502
(groans)

24:33.573 --> 24:36.039
(banging)
- inspector brackenreid!

24:36.108 --> 24:37.441
Please, come quickly.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.109
What is it? - Just come on - a
man's been killed

24:46.652 --> 24:47.718
- You found him?

24:47.853 --> 24:49.920
- Yes. I was on deck,

24:50.055 --> 24:52.055
Heard a commotion below.
I rushed down.

24:52.925 --> 24:53.924
- Did you see anything?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.125
- I'm sorry, no.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.528
- Mm. So, unless someone

24:57.663 --> 24:59.530
Boarded in the middle
of the night,

24:59.532 --> 25:00.931
Our killer is on this boat.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.066
- My heavens.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.800
- No one gets
on or off this ship.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.269
- Agreed.
- And cut the engines

25:05.338 --> 25:07.304
'til we get this sorted.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.806
Oh, and while you're at it,

25:09.842 --> 25:11.141
Cover the poor bugger up.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.180
- I don't see why this
is so hard for you.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.217
- I've yet to question
miss wiggins.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.218
- Why bother?

25:22.255 --> 25:24.355
She'll just declare
her innocence.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.725
All you have to do is prove
that she killed my husband.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.426
- I don't know that
to be the case.

25:29.495 --> 25:30.528
- Then make it the case.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.095
That is your only job.

25:32.131 --> 25:35.299
Do it and you can
return to your life.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.501
- She may be an innocent woman.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.237
- Oh, well,
if that troubles you,

25:40.372 --> 25:43.240
Find someone else
to become the guilty party.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.108
I don't care.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.977
I am now two days away
from death.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.381
Which means
your daughter is as well.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.718
- My god. She's just a child.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.220
- And I am not.

25:56.355 --> 25:59.523
That doesn't mean I don't
value my life.

25:59.658 --> 26:02.893
You should know by now I am very
determined to preserve it.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.196
Associates tell me
your little susannah

26:06.332 --> 26:08.799
Spoke her first words yesterday.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.603
Would be such a shame
if they were to be her last.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.638
- If you touch my daughter--
- detective!

26:15.741 --> 26:17.741
If you don't do as I ask,

26:17.777 --> 26:20.344
You will be spending
the rest of your life

26:20.413 --> 26:22.980
Explaining your decision
to your wife.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.149
Not a prospect I would relish.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.886
- I also don't relish
condemning an innocent woman.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.121
- Well, then,

26:31.256 --> 26:34.758
You'd best choose
the lesser of two evils.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.927
(curious music)

26:37.062 --> 26:38.963
(indistinct chatter)

26:39.098 --> 26:41.298
- Wendell dunston
is the second victim.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.733
At present,
there is no indication

26:42.802 --> 26:44.969
The two men knew each other.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.703
- I've got something
you're going to want to see.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.206
- Loui-- miss cherry,
you can't just walk in here.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.042
- All right. My information
and I are happy to leave.

26:52.078 --> 26:52.910
- What information?

26:54.380 --> 26:57.347
- This. I found it under
my office door this morning.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.917
- I'll ask that you make
an appointment next time,

26:59.919 --> 27:02.586
Miss cherry. I am acting
inspector right--

27:02.721 --> 27:03.754
Oh!

27:04.957 --> 27:07.391
- "what you are witnessing
is retribution.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.993
The deaths of robert foster

27:09.128 --> 27:11.161
And ned mcguire
have been avenged."

27:11.931 --> 27:13.096
- Any idea who they are?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.532
- I did some poking around.

27:15.568 --> 27:17.801
Robert foster was rent asunder
by a machine

27:17.803 --> 27:20.270
At arnauld lepage's
fabrication plant.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.739
Ned mcguire was killed
when a sandblasting machine

27:22.875 --> 27:25.075
At dunston's factory
malfunctioned.

27:25.111 --> 27:28.211
- So, what we are witnessing
is a mimicking of their deaths.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.347
- I also discovered
that neither employer

27:30.349 --> 27:32.082
Offered any compensation.

27:32.118 --> 27:35.152
Mr. Dunston even refused
to pay funeral costs.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.553
- Right. We need to speak
to the families

27:36.689 --> 27:37.954
Of the dead factory workers.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.289
- Are you sure?
They're in mourning.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.759
- Well, as of now,
they're also suspects.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.161
- Are you forgetting something,
inspector crabtree?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.362
- What's that?

27:45.497 --> 27:47.297
- Thank you is in order,
wouldn't you say?

27:53.639 --> 27:54.404
- Thank you.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.478
(crow cawing)

28:10.122 --> 28:11.588
- We'll get her back,

28:11.590 --> 28:13.790
Whatever it takes, julia.
I promise.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.760
- Even if that means
letting a murderer go free?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.464
- Once susannah is safe,

28:20.533 --> 28:23.333
We'll admit our part
in this deception.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.636
- Then what happens?

28:25.771 --> 28:27.137
- It doesn't matter

28:27.272 --> 28:30.207
So long as susannah
is returned to us.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.076
- Can we trust that
that will happen?

28:35.414 --> 28:36.880
- What choice do we have?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.952
(tense instrumental music)

28:45.791 --> 28:47.558
- Why aren't we moving?

28:47.693 --> 28:49.559
- We're not going anywhere
until I've given

28:49.595 --> 28:51.194
Captain roberts my say-so.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.096
- I need to get to toronto.
My mother is ill--

28:53.099 --> 28:54.831
- My investigation trumps that.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.166
- But--
- sit down.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.268
- You can't hold us
hostage out here.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.436
- We've done nothing wrong.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.104
- What authority
have you anyway?

29:01.107 --> 29:03.573
- That's enough. For now,
you're all to stay put.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.609
- Well, at least
it's a pleasant day.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.944
Are we allowed on deck,

29:07.079 --> 29:09.179
Or do we need to remain
cooped up in here?

29:09.314 --> 29:10.981
- Just don't leave the boat.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.984
- No worry there. I don't swim.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.353
I simply like
to take in the sun.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.855
You should know,

29:18.924 --> 29:20.524
I've noticed you watching me.

29:24.129 --> 29:24.962
(scoffs)

29:25.097 --> 29:27.931
- Thomas, can I throw
her overboard?

29:28.066 --> 29:29.333
- No.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.202
But you can find out
more about this lot.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.004
- You want me to help you?

29:34.006 --> 29:35.672
- Just be discreet.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.474
See if any one of them
has got a reason

29:37.609 --> 29:39.009
To harm mr. Griffith.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.478
- Hmm. You can count on me.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.480
If there are secrets,
I shall soon uncover them.

29:44.517 --> 29:45.749
(chuckling)

29:45.751 --> 29:47.751
(sighs)
- lord help me.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.356
- The coroner's report states
that mr. Fanshaw's death

29:52.491 --> 29:55.325
Was due to the ingestion
of a toxic agent.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.094
- Does it identify which one?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.830
(sighs)
- it lists a number

29:59.899 --> 30:02.699
Of possibilities,
but the report is inconclusive.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.201
- Shoddy work.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.102
- He was also cremated.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.905
- Well, that's unusual.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.575
So, no body to re-examine?

30:11.577 --> 30:13.509
- I doubt they would allow
an exhumation.

30:13.546 --> 30:18.515
We are private citizens
in a foreign country. However...

30:18.517 --> 30:19.716
- What?

30:19.718 --> 30:21.718
- Well, judging
by the toxicology report,

30:21.754 --> 30:23.519
A number of poisons
could be responsible,

30:23.556 --> 30:27.891
Including some that could be
found in cleaning supplies.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.794
- So, one could argue
that the maid

30:31.831 --> 30:33.864
Had the tools to do the job?

30:35.935 --> 30:38.134
- Well, given the evidence
of acrimony

30:38.170 --> 30:40.403
Between miss wiggins
and the family,

30:40.439 --> 30:42.606
It would be easy
to suggest motive.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.742
- The butler stated that
she was attacked

30:45.778 --> 30:47.410
And then summarily dismissed.

30:48.647 --> 30:52.883
That could give us motive
and possible method.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.486
- Well, especially
if said method

30:56.488 --> 30:58.521
Were to be found
in the maid's possession.

31:02.595 --> 31:03.860
- Do we do it?

31:06.699 --> 31:08.866
(suspenseful music)

31:09.001 --> 31:10.601
(indistinct chatter)

31:20.045 --> 31:22.112
- Another murder...

31:22.181 --> 31:25.916
And you're suggesting
the culprit was not a member

31:26.051 --> 31:28.251
Of one of the victim's
families seeking vengeance?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.253
- Robert foster left behind
an ailing wife

31:30.289 --> 31:31.588
And three young children.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.723
I doubt they were capable
of such violence.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.192
- And mr. Mcguire?

31:36.262 --> 31:38.594
- He had no family,
very few friends.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.930
Certainly doesn't seem
there is anyone

31:40.065 --> 31:41.865
Who would kill
to avenge his death.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.334
- So you're suggesting
the killer is somebody

31:44.370 --> 31:47.204
With no personal association
to the workers whatsoever?

31:47.339 --> 31:48.705
- It would appear.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.674
- So, what then? A vigilante?

31:51.710 --> 31:52.743
- I think so.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.014
(sinister music)

32:09.561 --> 32:11.627
What was it the inspector
used to say?

32:11.664 --> 32:13.229
- Bloody hell.
- Bloody hell.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.380
"three dead, the next to go,

32:30.382 --> 32:33.216
The butcher, the baker
and the candlestick maker."

32:39.658 --> 32:42.092
- Three of toronto's finest
dead on your watch.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.194
And three more to go if the note
found on the last body

32:44.263 --> 32:46.596
Is to be believed.
And then there's this.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.099
This rag of hers is nothing
more than scurrilous lies.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.268
Louise cherry should be in jail!

32:51.403 --> 32:53.003
- On what charge?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.504
- How the devil would I know?

32:54.506 --> 32:56.672
You're supposed
to be the inspector.
Make something up!

32:56.709 --> 32:58.742
- Sir, I can't do that.
- Look, I don't care.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.610
I just need you
to solve these damn murders!

33:00.746 --> 33:03.413
- Excuse me,
I might have something.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.547
- Well, speak up.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.350
- I've been checking
hospital records.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.684
- Hospital records?
Have you now?

33:08.721 --> 33:10.153
Is that the best
use of your time?

33:10.288 --> 33:11.354
- Sir! Watts, what have you?

33:11.357 --> 33:12.956
- I have a list of people
who have died

33:12.958 --> 33:14.758
In industrial accidents.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.226
- What is the point
of all of this?

33:16.295 --> 33:17.961
- All the people on the list
died doing jobs

33:18.096 --> 33:20.530
Related to the businesses run by
the next potential victims.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.465
- And who are the next
potential victims?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.100
- The butcher, the baker...

33:24.136 --> 33:25.502
- Yes, yes.
And the candlestick maker.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.903
I know. It's charming.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.505
- I'm attempting
to narrow that down.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.707
- Well, get to it!
And after you've done that,

33:30.709 --> 33:32.642
I want them all put under
police protection.

33:32.711 --> 33:33.977
It's good to know
at least one detective

33:33.979 --> 33:36.613
In this station house knows
how to do his damn job!

33:40.952 --> 33:42.585
- I think we need to speak
to louise cherry.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.720
- I hope you're not thinking
of arresting her.

33:44.757 --> 33:45.856
- Worse.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.192
I'm thinking about
asking her for help.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.861
(knocking on door)

33:54.133 --> 33:55.332
- Rachel wiggins?

33:56.502 --> 33:57.667
(whispering): Where should
I place it?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.102
- Uh, anywhere is fine.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.011
- Oh, dear lord.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.783
- Ugh, he was a boor.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.418
- He made advances
on both of us.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.253
- On numerous occasions.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.088
- Well, he was quite forwards.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.923
- We rejected him, of course.
- Of course.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.758
- Not our type.
- Not our type.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.761
- Oh. Ah, oh. Huh! Well.

34:24.830 --> 34:25.962
(chuckling)

34:25.964 --> 34:28.765
- He is the one your husband
should be questioning.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.534
The two fought constantly.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.369
- I did see the incident
at the card game.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.437
- Ah! That was just
the tip of the iceberg.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
- They were both pursuing fiona.
(gasps)

34:36.575 --> 34:39.776
- Trevor, there you are.
I've been looking for you.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.711
- I would think it was
the other way around.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.612
- Oh, you noticed as well?

34:42.747 --> 34:44.381
- Yes! She seems to have eyes

34:44.516 --> 34:46.049
On anyone with
a pair of trousers.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.183
- Honestly!

34:47.319 --> 34:48.952
- When do you think
we will be setting sail?

34:48.954 --> 34:51.354
- That is up to my husband.
- We do need to get home.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.090
- And off this terrible boat.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.892
- Mm. Uh. Yeah.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.594
- Gentlemen, if I knew
who sent the note,

34:57.729 --> 34:59.529
I would have told you.
On my word.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.932
- And you've received
no further correspondence?

35:02.067 --> 35:04.534
- Again, if I had,
I would have told you.

35:04.669 --> 35:06.669
- Your new paper has published

35:06.738 --> 35:09.539
A number of articles
about unsafe working conditions.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.875
- Yes, inspired
by upton sinclair.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.210
- What, the jungle?
It's a work of fiction.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.613
(sighs)

35:17.950 --> 35:20.683
- Inspired by fact, george.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.219
There are factory workers
all across the country

35:23.355 --> 35:26.222
Who are victim
to uncaring factory owners.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.157
I aim to improve conditions.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.692
- Not unlike our killer.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.628
- No, he's nothing like that.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.963
He's a murderer,
plain and simple.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.964
- Who thinks he has
a righteous cause.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.733
(scoffs)
- I use the pen,

35:36.868 --> 35:38.368
Not the sword, detective.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.171
There are numerous organizations
who aim to improve

35:41.173 --> 35:43.440
The conditions of working man,
and woman,

35:43.575 --> 35:45.175
That I support.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.644
None advocate violence.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.979
- The butcher, baker
and candlestick maker.

35:50.015 --> 35:51.881
Any idea who those
people could be?

35:53.752 --> 35:55.385
- Perhaps.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.587
- And would you be willing
to share that information?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.590
- I am.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.292
- In exchange for?

36:05.063 --> 36:06.929
- In this case, nothing.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.466
What this vigilante is doing
isn't improving the condition

36:09.468 --> 36:13.270
Of the working man. In fact,
he's going to make it worse.

36:13.272 --> 36:16.539
I have a feeling I may know who
the butcher and the baker are.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.542
- And the candlestick maker?

36:18.677 --> 36:19.976
- I'm not sure.

36:21.746 --> 36:22.645
- Dead?

36:23.916 --> 36:26.783
Oh. Should I say what a pity?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.252
- I think it's best
you don't say anything.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.355
- Well, that should make
your task easier, should it not?

36:32.490 --> 36:34.424
Seeing as miss wiggins
is no longer here

36:34.426 --> 36:35.592
To speak in her own defence.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.028
- We don't know that she
killed your husband.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.264
- We all know that
you're responsible for that.

36:41.399 --> 36:44.167
- Oh, you have a fire in you,
don't you?

36:45.437 --> 36:47.437
But whether she actually
killed my husband

36:47.439 --> 36:49.306
Is not the point.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.642
The point is to free me.

36:54.079 --> 36:57.180
The means of murder
were found in her room.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.983
And, seeing as she's now dead,

36:59.985 --> 37:03.253
It seems obvious that she killed
my dear frederick

37:03.322 --> 37:05.655
And then,
distraught at her wickedness,

37:05.691 --> 37:07.123
Took her own life.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.191
- She was innocent.

37:08.326 --> 37:11.394
- I don't see how that matters.
She's dead.

37:12.497 --> 37:16.232
But if your conscience
troubles you,

37:16.268 --> 37:18.200
Comfort yourself
with the fact that you're doing

37:18.237 --> 37:23.606
Nothing more than besmirching
a poor dead woman's memory.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.675
Nothing you can do
can hurt her now.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.611
But you can help me.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.480
And your child.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.252
(somber instrumental music)

38:15.393 --> 38:16.426
- Forgive me.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.070
- The young man, trevor,
seems very morose

38:27.072 --> 38:28.471
Since the murder. The trollop--

38:28.606 --> 38:31.907
- Fiona.
- Yes, the redhead.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.843
She's flitting around
without a care in the world.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.378
- And what about the other two?

38:35.513 --> 38:37.113
- Penny and caroline?

38:37.248 --> 38:39.082
I think they're sapphists.

38:39.217 --> 38:41.017
- So they could've
been the killers?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.284
- I didn't say that.
(snaps fingers)

38:42.321 --> 38:44.888
In fact, I think
they might have likely

38:45.023 --> 38:46.356
Been the ones to do it.

38:46.491 --> 38:47.324
- And why's that?

38:47.459 --> 38:49.626
- Well, they admit to hating
the man

38:49.761 --> 38:53.096
And they seem to be
casting blame on everyone else.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.331
Isn't that what killers do?

38:54.466 --> 38:57.033
- Sometimes.
And what about the captain?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.768
- Hmm. I don't think so.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.038
- Why?
- He's the captain.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.373
- Oh, right.
- Hmm.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.808
- Thank you, margaret.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.176
- Is there anything else
I can do?

39:06.311 --> 39:07.477
- Nope.
- Oh.

39:08.313 --> 39:09.412
- I'll take it from here.

39:10.782 --> 39:11.714
- I see.

39:11.783 --> 39:12.982
(door opens)

39:13.118 --> 39:14.517
Hmm. Of course.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.587
- One of my men confirms
finding the poison

39:17.656 --> 39:18.855
In miss wiggins's room.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.524
We've also questioned
the staff regarding

39:21.593 --> 39:25.328
Mr. Fanshaw's behavior
with regard to miss wiggins.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.630
And then, of course,
there was the suicide note.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.867
I just want you to know
that we never considered

39:31.002 --> 39:32.535
Miss wiggins a suspect.

39:32.537 --> 39:36.472
- To be fair, mrs. Fanshaw did
seem the most likely suspect.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.275
- Yes. It's understandable.
We may be in her employ,

39:39.277 --> 39:41.411
But I can't say
we're fond of her.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.446
- Yes, but I suppose
being distasteful

39:43.515 --> 39:44.847
Doesn't make one a murderer.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.350
(whistles blowing)

39:47.352 --> 39:49.018
- So, what are next steps?

39:50.288 --> 39:51.487
- I've already spoken
to the district attorney.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.156
He's going to see the judge.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.458
Talk is mrs. Fanshaw's
conviction'll be overturned.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.728
Mrs. Fanshaw
is a very lucky woman

39:58.863 --> 40:00.430
Having you two in her corner.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.497
Your reputations got her out.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.707
(light curious music)

40:53.785 --> 40:55.818
(♪♪)

40:59.557 --> 41:01.791
(inaudible conversation)

41:06.431 --> 41:07.597
- Oopsy daisy.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.441
(indistinct chatter)

41:23.482 --> 41:27.116
- I should like to propose
a toast

41:27.118 --> 41:30.986
To detective william murdoch
and dr. Julia ogden.

41:31.022 --> 41:34.757
I am a free woman today,
thanks to them.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.692
(applause)

41:39.998 --> 41:42.332
- You found the true killer.
Congratulations.

41:42.467 --> 41:43.799
- Where is our child?

41:43.835 --> 41:45.401
- She will be returned
in due time.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.737
- If she is not...

41:47.806 --> 41:49.839
- Mrs. Fanshaw
is a woman of her word.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.140
I can assure you.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.878
- I really must thank you again.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.413
Such a shame
about miss wiggins.

41:57.415 --> 42:00.049
I suppose she could not live
with what she had done.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.184
- You had her killed.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.520
- I should have thought
the great

42:03.655 --> 42:04.988
Detective william murdoch

42:05.123 --> 42:08.758
Would not be one
for baseless accusations.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.827
You do realize not a word
of this can be spoken.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.363
And remember:

42:13.365 --> 42:17.033
If I have outwitted you once,
I can again.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.436
- We just want to get home
to our child.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.405
- And you are perfectly free
to do so.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.641
But would you care
for a celebratory drink

42:25.710 --> 42:27.176
Before you leave?

42:27.178 --> 42:28.110
- No.

42:31.550 --> 42:32.682
- Pity.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.324
(indistinct chatter)

42:43.728 --> 42:45.395
- Excuse me, ladies,
have you seen my wife?

42:45.530 --> 42:48.464
- No. And I must say
she's a delightful woman.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.532
- Very inquisitive creature.

42:50.569 --> 42:51.801
- Ah.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.340
- Have you lost your wife?

42:57.342 --> 42:59.075
I could help you look
for her if you like.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.410
- That's not necessary.

43:00.545 --> 43:01.744
- Are you sure?

43:01.879 --> 43:03.947
I could use a little excitement.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.415
It's dreadfully boring
being becalmed.

43:07.619 --> 43:09.285
I prefer a rougher ride,

43:10.555 --> 43:12.221
The feeling of being
tossed about

43:12.290 --> 43:13.956
With reckless abandon.

43:15.226 --> 43:16.592
- I'm looking for my wife.

43:25.503 --> 43:28.304
Bloody hell, margaret, you best
not be snooping around.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.576
(sinister music)

43:33.711 --> 43:34.877
Margaret?

43:36.715 --> 43:37.880
Margaret!

43:42.053 --> 43:45.054
(mysterious music)

43:45.090 --> 43:45.989
Subtitling: Difuze
