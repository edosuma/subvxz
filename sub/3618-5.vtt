00:02.321 --> 00:06.328
<i>Today, we're gonna be talking about</i>
<i>The Five-Minute Orgasm,</i>

00:06.649 --> 00:09.975
a new book written by Nina Halter.

00:10.295 --> 00:11.998
Hi, Nina, welcome.

00:12.098 --> 00:14.482
Thank you. It's an honour
to be on your show, Phoebe.

00:14.583 --> 00:17.768
You're gonna get me in trouble.
It's not my show, I'm a guest host.

00:17.868 --> 00:19.771
Oh, I'm sorry, but
I've been watching all week

00:19.872 --> 00:23.097
and I love, love, love your topics.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.782
- So provocative.
- Thank you very much.

00:25.882 --> 00:27.825
And speaking of provocative,

00:27.926 --> 00:30.169
we should probably talk about this
book here of yours.

00:30.490 --> 00:31.752
It's wonderful, isn't it?

00:31.852 --> 00:34.597
To be honest with you, I haven't
been able to read the whole thing

00:34.697 --> 00:37.121
because I haven't had time,
but I love the title:

00:37.222 --> 00:39.886
<i>The Five-Minute Orgasm, amazing.</i>

00:39.986 --> 00:42.711
Okay, so I guess the first question
would be:

00:43.032 --> 00:45.015
Why only five minutes?

00:45.115 --> 00:47.259
I mean, don't you think that's
rushing it a bit?

00:47.359 --> 00:51.045
You misunderstood. It's not about
having one in five minutes,

00:51.406 --> 00:54.211
it's about having an orgasm
for five minutes.

00:56.615 --> 00:59.540
Oh, well, is this my copy?

01:00.742 --> 01:03.727
Okay, so let's just
cut to the chase here

01:03.827 --> 01:08.996
and I'm gonna ask you, how does one
experience this phenomenon?

01:09.357 --> 01:13.604
Well, it's really quite simple, really.
First...

01:21.938 --> 01:23.942
Chris!

01:25.505 --> 01:27.728
- Piper, let's go.
- No, Wyatt's upstairs.

01:27.829 --> 01:29.832
Just go get my sisters.

01:31.595 --> 01:33.719
This is just fascinating stuff.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.445
I have to ask you,
does it work for guys too?

01:37.766 --> 01:40.691
Well, there is a technique,

01:41.051 --> 01:42.955
- but it's quite dangerous.
- Dangerous?

01:43.055 --> 01:45.058
Really?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.074
Oh, no, you don't.

02:13.147 --> 02:15.631
I don't understand it.
This trick worked in '68.

02:15.992 --> 02:17.935
You forgot the saws, dear.

02:18.035 --> 02:19.618
I forgot the whats?

02:19.718 --> 02:21.721
It's okay. I got you covered.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.233
How'd they do that?

04:46.771 --> 04:49.275
So wait, a vortex did all of this?

04:49.376 --> 04:52.701
Vortex, whirlpool, I don't know,
whatever.

04:53.022 --> 04:55.606
Well, if it's a whirlpool,
there would probably be some water.

04:55.707 --> 04:58.511
The fineries of what almost killed Piper
aren't important. The point is,

04:58.832 --> 05:01.056
she was almost killed
and no one was here to help.

05:01.156 --> 05:04.241
You're right, I'm sorry.
I was kind of tied up. Or cut in half.

05:04.562 --> 05:07.527
And I was interviewing
the most fascinating woman.

05:07.847 --> 05:09.951
Oh, the orgasm lady!
That show was great.

05:10.051 --> 05:13.457
At least what I saw of it
until the TV was sucked into oblivion.

05:13.778 --> 05:15.881
I hope you brought home that book.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.546
Piper, doesn't it bother you
you had to vanquish that demon alone?

05:19.227 --> 05:20.730
Yeah, well, sure.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.252
But, you know, we all have lives,

05:22.352 --> 05:25.077
which is why I need this place
cleaned up before my guests arrive.

05:25.398 --> 05:26.660
Who's coming?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.244
Mary has designed a fashion line
and she wants to show us all.

05:29.565 --> 05:30.987
I love clothes.

05:31.087 --> 05:32.630
Wait, we've got a demon to hunt.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.994
If I could just find him in here.

05:35.094 --> 05:37.158
Okay, but regardless of
what you find in there,

05:37.258 --> 05:41.946
I'm gonna be with my friends, because
I will have a normal life if it kills me.

05:43.148 --> 05:45.953
Piper, why don't you have Leo heal
that when he comes to pick up Wyatt?

05:46.274 --> 05:48.798
Because I don't need magic
to heal a cut.

05:49.118 --> 05:51.142
I'd use magic for everything
if I could.

05:51.242 --> 05:54.027
Well, if I had done this fighting
a demon that would be one thing.

05:54.127 --> 05:56.651
But I did it in the kitchen,
the chef did it in the kitchen,

05:56.972 --> 05:59.897
so that person will wear this bandage
for the shame of it all.

06:00.538 --> 06:03.042
Well, this book is not gonna help us.

06:03.143 --> 06:05.266
But I've seen vortexes like that before.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.891
You know, this job would be
so much easier

06:07.991 --> 06:10.475
if there weren't so many roses.

06:10.796 --> 06:11.938
What's with all the roses?

06:12.038 --> 06:15.324
I think Jason thinks that he's losing me
and as an empath,

06:15.684 --> 06:19.210
I don't know who's feeling what
anymore and I just have my guard up.

06:19.571 --> 06:21.755
You should know that the
vortexes suck their victims

06:21.855 --> 06:23.397
into pocket realms
or alternate realities.

06:23.498 --> 06:25.742
You know, sometimes guys can be
funny like that, you know.

06:26.062 --> 06:28.807
The more you pull away,
the more they come back at you.

06:28.907 --> 06:32.193
Yeah, but I'm not pulling away.
I really like him.

06:32.553 --> 06:34.777
Dangerous alternate realities,
people.

06:34.877 --> 06:37.602
Based on fantasies.
Desires. Dreams.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.490
So stop worrying about it
and let him wine and dine you.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.754
I mean, a little wooing
never killed anyone.

06:44.854 --> 06:46.678
But a demon can,
so can we please,

06:46.778 --> 06:48.401
please, let's focus.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.404
Piper, you were almost sent
to another world.

06:50.504 --> 06:52.167
That takes serious magic.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.311
Magic. Brilliant idea.

06:54.952 --> 06:58.278
<i>Let the object of objection</i>
<i>become but a dream</i>

06:58.638 --> 07:02.084
<i>As I cause the scene to be unseen</i>

07:07.093 --> 07:08.876
Well, call me butter
because I'm on a roll.

07:08.976 --> 07:11.019
Wow, that's much better.
Thanks, Paige.

07:11.340 --> 07:13.123
Yep, well, gotta get back
to the temp job.

07:13.223 --> 07:15.908
Don't know how much longer those
old folks are gonna be alive.

07:16.749 --> 07:18.492
And I'll walk you out because

07:18.593 --> 07:20.416
- I have to meet Jason for lunch.
- Yo!

07:20.516 --> 07:22.660
No. No, no. We have a demon to hunt.
Get back here!

07:22.760 --> 07:25.384
See you later, Chris.
We'll talk about it later.

07:25.484 --> 07:28.449
You are our new favourite whitelighter
and all, but you need to lighten up.

07:28.770 --> 07:30.233
No, you three need to get serious.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.037
If you keep putting your personal
lives before your Wiccan duties,

07:33.138 --> 07:35.401
- you're gonna pay for it.
- Maybe so, but not today.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.525
I scared away the demon,
he's not coming back,

07:37.625 --> 07:41.833
I have friends coming and I also have
chocolate chip cookies in the oven.

07:46.681 --> 07:48.684
It's your fault I have to do this now.

08:02.789 --> 08:04.792
- You!
- Wait, before you...

08:10.201 --> 08:12.686
Would you just relax?
I didn't come here to vanquish you.

08:13.006 --> 08:15.731
How did you find me here?
No one's ever been to my lair.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.057
I didn't have to find you, Gith.
I know you.

08:19.577 --> 08:21.240
From the future.

08:21.341 --> 08:23.344
I came here to give you what you want.

08:24.386 --> 08:26.389
The Charmed Ones.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.143
So I'm sitting there in the middle
of this board meeting

08:34.243 --> 08:37.609
and I completely lose all concentration
because all I can think about is you.

08:37.969 --> 08:40.754
It's like they were speaking
a foreign language.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.857
Well, you were in Hong Kong.

08:43.337 --> 08:45.282
The point is, I flew straight back.

08:45.382 --> 08:47.566
So you could regain
your concentration?

08:47.666 --> 08:49.569
To concentrate on you.

08:49.669 --> 08:52.915
Well, I will try to keep your mind
from wandering.

08:53.716 --> 08:54.938
What's it gonna be tonight,

08:55.039 --> 08:57.403
<i>box seats at La BohÐ¸me</i>
<i>or backstage at Metallica?</i>

08:57.723 --> 09:01.490
Phoebe? Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Could you...?

09:01.850 --> 09:03.713
Yeah, absolutely.

09:03.814 --> 09:05.817
You know, I've been watching you
on TV all week.

09:06.258 --> 09:07.560
You were huge.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.545
Oh, well, the TV does add ten pounds.

09:10.866 --> 09:12.689
Oh, no, no...!

09:12.789 --> 09:15.674
Oh, there it is, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it like that at all.

09:17.117 --> 09:19.681
- No, I know what you meant.
- Okay.

09:20.362 --> 09:22.566
Thank you. Bye.

09:24.569 --> 09:27.374
She's right, you know.
You could be huge.

09:27.695 --> 09:29.738
I'm taping my last show today.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.363
It doesn't have to end.

09:32.463 --> 09:34.627
I own TV stations all around the world.

09:34.947 --> 09:37.271
Are you offering me the world,
Jason Dean?

09:37.592 --> 09:39.916
Yes. All except Kazakhstan,
I don't have stations there.

09:42.881 --> 09:46.367
Look, I appreciate you hopping your jet
to see me.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.895
And the roses,
all ten dozen of them,

09:51.215 --> 09:52.718
and the shows and the dinners

09:52.818 --> 09:55.503
and the private concert by the
San Francisco Symphony.

09:55.823 --> 09:58.207
- But?
- No.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.591
No buts. I like you.

10:00.952 --> 10:03.116
I like you a lot,
and you don't have to try so hard.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.340
- I know.
- You do?

10:05.440 --> 10:08.846
You're a very easy girl to please
and I love that about you.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.230
But have you ever stopped
to consider that

10:11.330 --> 10:13.654
maybe I enjoy
doing these things for you?

10:15.337 --> 10:17.340
No, actually,
that never occurred to me.

10:21.748 --> 10:24.392
I don't like to talk about it,

10:24.753 --> 10:29.441
but you're dating a minor media mogul
here, so can I make a suggestion?

10:29.842 --> 10:31.344
Sure.

10:31.445 --> 10:34.570
Let go. Lose control a little bit.

10:35.572 --> 10:37.755
Trust me and just enjoy the ride.

10:37.856 --> 10:40.039
You mean, let you drive?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.263
I don't know, I'm not a very good...

10:46.190 --> 10:48.193
Passenger.

11:01.176 --> 11:03.860
Oh, look, Daddy's here.

11:04.181 --> 11:06.485
- We need to talk.
- No, you need to orb.

11:06.585 --> 11:08.328
There are diapers in the bag. Here.

11:08.428 --> 11:11.634
Wyatt is very excited to spend
the afternoon with you.

11:13.036 --> 11:15.360
Was that a sneeze?
Are you feeling all right, buddy?

11:15.681 --> 11:18.486
Daddy will heal you up right away
and then take care of Mommy's hand.

11:18.806 --> 11:20.469
No, no, no. No magic, really.

11:20.569 --> 11:23.855
He has a common cold and
babies need to develop immunities.

11:24.175 --> 11:25.998
Not when his father's
a miracle worker.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.763
No, really. If I'm gonna lead
any kind of a normal life,

11:28.863 --> 11:31.428
there will be no healing for any of us.

11:31.909 --> 11:33.732
So you just want him to suffer.

11:33.832 --> 11:35.294
Don't be so dramatic.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.280
If he had a serious illness,
I would be the first one to call you.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.784
But he doesn't, so in the meantime,

11:40.884 --> 11:43.048
just watch him and fret,
like a normal person.

11:44.851 --> 11:47.035
Now go.

11:47.135 --> 11:50.340
Well, that's...
I can't take Wyatt today.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.724
You can't take Wyatt?
What do you mean?

11:52.825 --> 11:54.367
You asked to take Wyatt.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.090
You know, father-son bonding.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.815
Yeah, that was until I found out
about this.

11:58.915 --> 12:00.257
Do you know where Chris got it?

12:00.358 --> 12:01.540
A swap meet?

12:01.640 --> 12:02.982
He killed for it.

12:03.082 --> 12:05.186
The Valkyrie who owned this pendant
was murdered.

12:05.286 --> 12:06.428
Leo, this is not cool.

12:06.528 --> 12:08.572
I have people coming here
in ten minutes.

12:08.892 --> 12:10.475
Chris isn't who he says he is.

12:10.575 --> 12:12.959
I know he banished me to Valhalla
and this proves it.

12:13.059 --> 12:14.241
You know what, Leo?

12:14.342 --> 12:16.646
Nothing will ever change with you.
You always find a way

12:16.746 --> 12:19.030
to make your job more important
than your family.

12:19.350 --> 12:21.334
Taking care of my family is my job,
Piper.

12:21.434 --> 12:23.718
And right now I need to find out
what Chris is up to.

12:28.927 --> 12:31.692
You must think I'm pretty low
on the evolutionary ladder.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.156
- That's not true.
- A minor horned demon,

12:34.256 --> 12:35.919
a lesser slime devil.

12:36.019 --> 12:38.042
Just another common fiend
with no power.

12:38.143 --> 12:40.487
I have the greatest respect
for your power.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.089
Then don't insult me.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.173
Whitelighters don't kill their charges.

12:44.273 --> 12:46.337
Well, I'm not your typical whitelighter.

12:46.437 --> 12:49.562
I came from the future because
I need the power of the Charmed Ones.

12:49.883 --> 12:51.426
- To do what?
- Not your concern.

12:51.526 --> 12:54.571
All you need to know is
they're drifting apart.

12:55.613 --> 12:57.356
How do you mean, "drifting apart"?

12:57.456 --> 12:59.519
They're putting their desires
before their duties.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.323
And that makes them useless to me.

13:01.423 --> 13:04.428
You said, "desires"?

13:05.390 --> 13:07.413
You caught that, huh?

13:07.513 --> 13:09.096
That's what you feed off of, right?

13:09.196 --> 13:11.680
Though I never quite understood
how one could eat a desire.

13:13.243 --> 13:17.651
Do you know how much energy is
contained in an unfulfilled desire?

13:18.051 --> 13:20.496
People spend their whole lives
wanting something.

13:20.816 --> 13:22.980
Usually never getting it.

13:23.982 --> 13:25.765
I feed off that energy.

13:25.865 --> 13:28.549
Just think how much power
the Charmed Ones must pack.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.934
You... you know their desires.

13:31.034 --> 13:32.576
It's all right here.

13:32.677 --> 13:34.019
With this, no messy vortexes,

13:34.119 --> 13:37.805
you can bring them into your world
from the comfort of your own cave.

13:40.770 --> 13:44.497
They'll die, you know.
Victims of their own desires.

13:44.817 --> 13:46.320
Is that what you want?

13:46.420 --> 13:48.864
I'm counting on it.
Why else would I offer to help?

13:50.227 --> 13:52.410
So good luck.

13:52.511 --> 13:55.275
And for the sake of both our lives,
don't screw this up.

13:58.801 --> 14:03.329
"A normal life with normal friends
and no magic."

14:04.612 --> 14:06.815
Ask and ye shall receive.

14:18.996 --> 14:21.000
Is that a sneeze?

14:26.529 --> 14:29.975
Okay, I'm gonna put you down here
for two seconds.

14:30.416 --> 14:33.121
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

14:33.221 --> 14:36.386
Okay, you're good. You're okay.

14:39.431 --> 14:41.335
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.619
- It's been too long.
- I know.

14:43.719 --> 14:46.063
Oh, I hope you don't mind,
a few friends tagged along.

14:46.163 --> 14:49.188
Oh, no, not at all, Elizabeth said
you might be bringing a few friends.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.272
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

14:51.372 --> 14:53.696
- Five.
- Hello. Oh, I can't wait.

14:54.217 --> 14:56.481
- Or eight.
- Oh, see, I told you,

14:56.581 --> 15:00.347
- you should have called her.
- Oh, no, no, really, it's fine.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.152
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting to do this.

15:03.473 --> 15:05.476
Okay. Living room, girls.

15:06.718 --> 15:09.103
They're all dying to see
my new line of lingerie.

15:09.203 --> 15:11.767
- Oh, you design lingerie?
- You're gonna love it.

15:12.088 --> 15:15.013
Oh, sure, just as long as
I don't have to try any of it on.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.796
Well, you'd look silly if you did.

15:16.896 --> 15:19.520
You don't have what it takes
to fill the pouch.

15:19.621 --> 15:20.763
The pouch?

15:20.863 --> 15:22.866
Meet my models.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.970
Sorry. Hi.

15:25.070 --> 15:28.516
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the pouch.

15:28.837 --> 15:30.840
So where can we change?

15:31.561 --> 15:34.166
- My bedroom's free.
- Right this way.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.171
Come on, honey.

15:39.735 --> 15:43.061
And abracadabra.

15:48.270 --> 15:51.255
Where's the...
The rabbit?

15:51.355 --> 15:53.719
The rabbit died last year, dear.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.170
What?

16:01.012 --> 16:03.015
Charlie.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.680
Okay, somebody call 911.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.523
It's his heart.
Charlie, can you hear me?

16:07.623 --> 16:09.567
Hold on, Mr. Rolls,
we're calling an ambulance.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.831
We haven't got time for an ambulance,
he needs help now.

16:12.512 --> 16:15.757
All right, I can get him there faster,
but everybody's gotta clear the room.

16:16.118 --> 16:18.322
- I can't leave his side.
- Please, he's gonna die.

16:18.642 --> 16:21.427
Just use your magic
and orb him to the hospital.

16:21.527 --> 16:22.870
How do you know?

16:22.970 --> 16:25.033
I think it's a good idea,
you should orb him.

16:25.133 --> 16:27.197
- You know too?
- That you're a witch?

16:27.297 --> 16:29.361
- Everybody knows.
- Yeah.

16:29.461 --> 16:30.723
- Yes.
- Please.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.686
We're running out of time.

16:32.787 --> 16:34.770
All right, all right, just keep it a secret.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.874
Of course.

16:40.079 --> 16:41.582
Hey.

16:41.682 --> 16:43.625
I can't believe I'm taping
my last show today.

16:43.725 --> 16:45.108
This week just flew by.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.151
Usually happens
when you're having a good time.

16:47.251 --> 16:49.896
Yeah, I have to admit, it has been fun.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.581
Thank you, Bret.

16:53.021 --> 16:54.444
You know, it doesn't have to end.

16:54.544 --> 16:56.548
Oh, don't start with that again.

16:57.629 --> 16:59.733
Miss Halliwell, you're on
in 30 seconds.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.837
Okay.

17:02.918 --> 17:04.540
You said you'd enjoy the ride.

17:04.641 --> 17:06.585
- Right.
- So enjoy it.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.848
When you step out on that stage
today, don't hold back.

17:09.169 --> 17:11.153
I want you to lose yourself
in the moment, okay?

17:11.252 --> 17:14.098
- You might be surprised.
- But I don't like surprises.

17:19.227 --> 17:21.210
Okay, you know the drill.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.354
And we're going in five...
four...

17:23.674 --> 17:25.798
three... two...

17:36.176 --> 17:38.179
Hi.

17:41.184 --> 17:43.188
Welcome to the show.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.919
Welcome to my show.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.404
- That was amazing.
- You were amazing.

18:04.504 --> 18:07.990
To be in front of a live audience
like that and feel all the passion.

18:08.311 --> 18:10.655
- So you liked it?
- How did you pull it off so fast?

18:10.755 --> 18:12.498
I bought off a lot of people.

18:12.598 --> 18:15.323
- Did you buy them too?
- No, those belong to you.

18:15.684 --> 18:17.226
They've been here all week
to see you.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.070
- Blake, can you stay close?
- No problem.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.512
- Who's Blake?
- Your bodyguard.

18:20.612 --> 18:22.315
What? I thought he was a grip.

18:22.415 --> 18:24.840
Hi. There you go.

18:24.940 --> 18:27.664
Thanks.
Oh, they're beautiful, thank you.

18:27.985 --> 18:30.549
Hi. There you go.

18:33.394 --> 18:35.177
You saved my marriage.

18:35.277 --> 18:38.002
My Janie was gonna leave me
until I read your column.

18:39.004 --> 18:40.627
Thank you so much.

18:40.727 --> 18:43.692
- You're welcome.
- It's like walking with Gandhi.

18:44.013 --> 18:45.595
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.699
- Let's go.
- What is this?

18:48.741 --> 18:50.744
Thank you, Blake.

18:56.955 --> 18:59.579
Jason, I appreciate everything
you're trying to do for me

18:59.679 --> 19:01.302
but a lot of this doesn't make sense.

19:01.402 --> 19:03.847
Like, I swear those people
weren't here a few hours ago.

19:04.167 --> 19:06.371
And the elaborate stage,
how did you get them to...?

19:06.692 --> 19:08.695
Hey, you promised.

19:09.376 --> 19:11.860
I know, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

19:13.383 --> 19:15.286
Home, Blake.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.089
I got a big surprise for you.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.193
Wait, bigger than all of this?

19:19.954 --> 19:23.641
Phoebe! Phoebe!
I love you, Phoebe!

19:51.689 --> 19:52.831
We need to talk.

19:52.931 --> 19:54.634
Sorry, not now.

19:54.734 --> 19:57.359
Oh, yeah, now.

19:57.459 --> 19:59.042
Look familiar?

19:59.142 --> 20:01.706
- I don't have time for this.
- You had time to kill a Valkyrie.

20:02.027 --> 20:04.571
Whitelighters don't kill,
or did you not read the manual?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.094
But it's all right for an Elder?

20:06.194 --> 20:07.897
You have Valkyrie blood
on your hands.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.420
Fighting to protect the sisters.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.525
You went out, hunted a Valkyrie
to steal her magic.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.171
Oh, so that makes you
the noble one, right?

20:16.532 --> 20:18.115
Face it, Chris, I got you this time.

20:18.215 --> 20:20.158
Enough to get
your whitelighter status stripped

20:20.258 --> 20:22.262
and your soul sent back
down to Earth for recycling.

20:22.783 --> 20:25.587
- You do what you have to do.
- I already did.

20:25.908 --> 20:28.633
I arranged a hearing
with the Elders tonight.

20:29.113 --> 20:31.478
I expect this will be your last day
as a whitelighter.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.164
That's... quite possible.

20:35.845 --> 20:37.848
Excuse me.

20:39.932 --> 20:41.675
Why are you making
a vanquishing potion?

20:41.775 --> 20:43.278
To help the sisters.

20:43.378 --> 20:46.984
- Why aren't they making it?
- Because they're busy.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.878
- I can't sense them.
- Don't worry. I'm on it.

20:55.238 --> 20:56.621
You know, if I can't sense them,

20:56.721 --> 20:59.045
- it means they're not in this world.
- I said, I'm on it.

21:01.770 --> 21:02.952
Where are you going?

21:03.052 --> 21:05.035
To bring them back, now lay off.

21:05.135 --> 21:08.461
Till I find out what's going on,
I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

21:08.822 --> 21:12.107
You don't trust me, fine.
I get it. But get this.

21:12.428 --> 21:15.333
If I don't show up where
I'm supposed to be, alone,

21:15.433 --> 21:18.038
they'll die. Your call.

21:38.954 --> 21:41.759
Hey. They said I could come back.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.223
Is Charlie gonna be okay?

21:44.323 --> 21:45.826
Thanks to you.

21:45.926 --> 21:49.492
No, thanks to the doctors.
I was just his cosmic taxi.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.595
Oh, Paige, you saved his life.

21:51.696 --> 21:53.699
Well, it felt nice to help out.

21:55.262 --> 21:58.668
I'm just curious,
how did you know that I had a...

21:59.028 --> 22:00.891
...a power?

22:00.992 --> 22:02.695
A power?

22:02.795 --> 22:04.257
You mean your magic?

22:04.357 --> 22:06.962
Okay, let's keep it down
because it's just our secret.

22:07.282 --> 22:10.488
Oh, Paige, don't be shy.
Your magic's a godsend.

22:11.049 --> 22:14.134
Well, if you hadn't been a witch,
I would be a...

22:14.455 --> 22:15.757
I'd be a widow right now.

22:15.857 --> 22:18.081
Okay, just don't say "witch."
Someone might hear you.

22:18.181 --> 22:21.066
So, what if they do?
This ain't Salem, honey.

22:21.387 --> 22:23.510
There's no shame
in being a witch today.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.955
You should use your magic with pride.

22:51.919 --> 22:55.405
That's great design detail there.

22:55.726 --> 22:58.931
Thanks, I try to use the natural
contours of a man's body

22:59.252 --> 23:01.816
along with clean, simple lines
to convey an image

23:02.137 --> 23:04.140
of sensuous sophistication.

23:05.142 --> 23:07.146
I just think it's hot.

23:10.351 --> 23:13.496
It doesn't provide a lot of support,
though, now does it?

23:13.597 --> 23:15.600
That's the point.

23:16.642 --> 23:18.345
So you guys do this a lot?

23:18.445 --> 23:21.410
You mean stare at half-naked men
under a socially accepted pretence?

23:21.731 --> 23:24.015
- Yeah.
- Every chance we get.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.960
<i>Our lives used to be very</i>
<i>Sex and the City,</i>

23:27.060 --> 23:30.185
<i>then we got married, had kids,</i>
<i>and it's Celibacy in the Suburbs.</i>

23:30.546 --> 23:32.649
I've just missed so much, haven't I?

23:32.750 --> 23:34.953
I guess you could say that.

23:37.237 --> 23:41.044
Oh, speaking of families,
I think all this noise woke up Wyatt.

23:41.404 --> 23:43.809
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

23:46.293 --> 23:48.637
Hey, hey, bud, you're okay.

23:48.737 --> 23:51.362
What's the matter? Come here.

23:51.462 --> 23:53.465
You're all right.

23:54.146 --> 23:56.971
Actually, you're burning up a little.

23:57.071 --> 23:59.175
Come here, come here.

23:59.275 --> 24:01.138
Okay.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.643
Look, look, look. Let me see.

24:07.249 --> 24:09.433
A hundred and two?

24:09.533 --> 24:11.356
That's not good.

24:11.456 --> 24:13.159
Leo!

24:13.259 --> 24:15.704
Leo, come on, Wyatt needs you.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.162
No offence, Blake.

24:27.484 --> 24:28.986
- We're alone.
- I wasn't joking

24:29.087 --> 24:31.190
when I said I wanted
to give you the world, Phoebe.

24:31.290 --> 24:33.234
That live audience wasn't just
to impress you,

24:33.334 --> 24:36.900
that was a test run for a nationally
syndicated talk show starring you.

24:38.503 --> 24:40.967
What? Are you kidding me?

24:41.067 --> 24:44.673
I have commitments from my O&amp;O's,
that's 12 major TV markets.

24:44.994 --> 24:47.078
And don't worry,
once they see the test run,

24:47.398 --> 24:50.163
<i>everybody in the country's</i>
<i>gonna want to Ask Phoebe, live.</i>

24:50.483 --> 24:53.288
- So, what do you think?
- I think this is moving very fast.

24:53.609 --> 24:55.612
Yeah, isn't it great?

24:57.495 --> 24:59.499
We're coming to the penthouse.

24:59.819 --> 25:02.083
Penthouse?
I thought you were taking me home.

25:02.184 --> 25:04.868
That is your home.
Well, it's your new home.

25:12.321 --> 25:14.324
Phoebe!

25:14.885 --> 25:17.290
- Oh, my God!
- Phoebe!

25:23.781 --> 25:26.025
Okay, Jason, enough is enough here.

25:26.546 --> 25:28.649
I know this is all coming from
a really good place

25:28.749 --> 25:31.093
but you can't just take over my life.

25:31.194 --> 25:33.197
I'm not even sure I want to star
in my own...

25:33.518 --> 25:35.261
We need to get inside.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.264
Clear a path.

25:37.364 --> 25:39.368
Where did all these people
come from?

25:40.490 --> 25:42.493
Back up.

25:47.902 --> 25:50.206
Phoebe, I've read every one
of your columns.

25:50.306 --> 25:53.031
- They're on all my walls.
- Great, thank you.

25:53.632 --> 25:56.076
- This is too much.
- Isn't it great?

25:56.998 --> 25:59.522
I don't think any of this is real,
I think something's wrong.

25:59.843 --> 26:02.287
- What?
- I said I think something is wrong.

26:02.608 --> 26:05.252
My wife left me because of you!

26:05.573 --> 26:07.576
No, wait. Phoebe.

26:07.897 --> 26:09.439
Yeah, I never posed for that.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.523
See, this isn't my world.

26:11.623 --> 26:13.526
Do you know how much pain
you caused me?

26:13.627 --> 26:15.009
This isn't even my fantasy.

26:15.109 --> 26:17.012
Wait till you see the penthouse
I bought you,

26:17.113 --> 26:19.837
- it's got the best bay views of the city.
- No, we can't go in there.

26:20.158 --> 26:22.261
I know this isn't gonna make
any sense to you,

26:22.362 --> 26:23.944
but I don't think any of this is real,

26:24.044 --> 26:26.148
I think we're in some kind
of alternate reality.

26:26.248 --> 26:29.273
What are you talking crazy for,
Phoebe? This is real, it's me.

26:29.374 --> 26:31.377
I'm real.

26:33.421 --> 26:35.424
Gun!

26:39.030 --> 26:41.034
It's time for you to feel pain!

26:49.769 --> 26:51.772
We gotta get you inside.

27:04.033 --> 27:06.037
I don't understand.

27:07.279 --> 27:08.381
Something wrong?

27:08.481 --> 27:11.106
The boyfriend took the bullet.
It was meant for the witch.

27:11.206 --> 27:12.828
You tried to kill one of them already?

27:12.929 --> 27:14.872
I create worlds.
I don't control them.

27:14.972 --> 27:17.296
They work in their own way,
in their own time.

27:17.977 --> 27:21.784
But this is the first time a victim's ever
escaped a direct attempt on their life.

27:22.185 --> 27:24.188
Yeah, well, pretty good, aren't they?

27:25.871 --> 27:27.173
It's okay.

27:27.273 --> 27:29.838
Their desires will kill them eventually.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.805
After all, that is what you desire,
isn't it?

27:35.207 --> 27:37.210
Actually...

27:42.299 --> 27:45.064
I could sense your desire
from the beginning.

27:45.425 --> 27:49.191
You never wanted to kill your charges,
just teach them a lesson.

27:50.353 --> 27:52.917
That's right. Darklighter arrow.

27:55.602 --> 27:57.505
Poison shouldn't take long.

27:57.606 --> 28:00.110
But with luck, you may just
live long enough

28:00.210 --> 28:03.496
to watch the Charmed Ones
learn their lesson after all.

28:10.548 --> 28:13.353
Okay, Mama's gonna take care
of everything right now.

28:15.597 --> 28:17.600
What is this?

28:18.642 --> 28:20.705
No, no, this can't be happening.

28:20.806 --> 28:22.549
Leo, Chris, anybody!

28:22.649 --> 28:25.193
There you are. Is everything okay?

28:25.293 --> 28:28.699
No, Wyatt has a 102 temperature
and I think it's getting worse.

28:29.020 --> 28:31.624
Leo, come on, your son needs you!

28:32.025 --> 28:34.389
Honey, Leo's not here.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.773
You two split up, remember?

28:36.873 --> 28:40.119
A hundred and two?
Piper, that boy needs a doctor.

28:40.439 --> 28:42.884
- Let me drive you.
- No, no, I got it, it's okay.

28:51.919 --> 28:53.923
I heard that woman say you're a witch.

28:54.804 --> 28:56.948
Oh, that. She was just being silly.

28:57.048 --> 28:59.071
You have to help my daughter.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.375
<i>Okay, I've landed in</i>
<i>Twilight Zone...</i>

29:01.696 --> 29:03.319
Please.

29:03.419 --> 29:06.103
Okay, that hurts.
But I need to wake up now.

29:06.424 --> 29:08.327
Demons attacked us.

29:08.427 --> 29:11.633
I hid Susie.
But they're gonna find her.

29:12.274 --> 29:14.017
You're a witch, you can save her.

29:14.117 --> 29:16.101
Okay, this can't be happening.

29:16.201 --> 29:18.024
Chris, I need some help here.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.907
Please.

29:20.007 --> 29:22.452
She's just a little girl.

29:24.215 --> 29:26.459
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.143
Tell me where you left her.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.321
Fireball.

29:55.388 --> 29:57.392
Where are you?

30:00.758 --> 30:02.761
Pipe.

30:12.257 --> 30:14.261
Susie?

30:14.662 --> 30:16.324
Susie, it's okay.

30:16.425 --> 30:18.428
You can come out now.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.413
It's okay.

30:21.513 --> 30:23.577
Your mom sent me.

30:23.677 --> 30:26.121
That's it. It's all right.

30:27.163 --> 30:29.166
It's okay.

30:29.607 --> 30:31.611
Okay.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.375
Let's get you out of here.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.114
This can't be real.

30:48.119 --> 30:50.123
Okay, it's real, go wait in there.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.727
Hey, you.

30:54.210 --> 30:56.213
Looking for me?

30:58.297 --> 31:00.300
- Anyone else?
- Look out!

31:03.225 --> 31:05.589
What the hell is going on?

31:06.030 --> 31:08.514
You're gonna be okay, baby.
We're gonna get you out of this.

31:09.756 --> 31:11.139
Leo!

31:11.239 --> 31:13.102
Who are you calling?

31:13.202 --> 31:15.606
My brother-in-law. He's a healer.

31:15.927 --> 31:18.612
No offence, babe,
but I don't think he can hear you.

31:18.932 --> 31:21.056
Isn't Blake calling 911?

31:21.817 --> 31:23.881
Yeah, he is.

31:23.981 --> 31:26.726
I know this isn't gonna make
a lot of sense to you

31:26.826 --> 31:28.809
but I don't think this world is real,
you know?

31:28.909 --> 31:31.053
I don't know if there are
paramedics here.

31:31.153 --> 31:35.441
- This world isn't real?
- Yeah. If I had to guess...

31:35.761 --> 31:41.892
...I would say it's a world of desire.
But it's not my desire, it's your desire.

31:42.332 --> 31:45.498
I can feel how much you want
all of this for me.

31:45.859 --> 31:47.321
It's true, Phoebe.

31:47.421 --> 31:51.588
I want everything for you,
including sanity.

31:51.949 --> 31:55.515
So if I die, promise me
you'll see a doctor.

31:56.517 --> 31:58.520
You're not gonna die.

31:59.121 --> 32:00.664
We're gonna get you out of here.

32:00.764 --> 32:01.986
An empath.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.290
You didn't tell me the middle sister
was an empath.

32:05.452 --> 32:07.275
Sorry.

32:07.376 --> 32:10.581
She must have been feeling his desire
when I created her world.

32:10.942 --> 32:15.189
It's no matter.
My worlds always kill their victims.

32:15.550 --> 32:19.076
You know why?
Because desires are empty.

32:19.436 --> 32:21.340
They lack foundation.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.206
This world will fall too.
It's only a matter of time.

32:25.887 --> 32:28.071
I'm getting thirsty.

32:28.171 --> 32:30.576
Okay, I'll try to see
if I can find something.

32:34.342 --> 32:36.345
No!

32:42.676 --> 32:44.680
Jason?

32:46.162 --> 32:47.465
Thanks.

32:47.565 --> 32:49.688
Fireball!

32:53.054 --> 32:54.517
Welcome to my world.

32:54.617 --> 32:55.999
Wait, you have a world too?

32:56.099 --> 32:58.704
Yeah. All magic, all the time,
just what I wanted.

32:59.024 --> 33:00.527
So you figured it out.

33:00.627 --> 33:04.474
Well, yeah, if you mean the whole
"vortex of deadly desires" thing.

33:04.794 --> 33:07.098
- How'd you escape?
- I have no idea.

33:07.199 --> 33:09.503
It just sort of happened.
But I have to go back there

33:09.603 --> 33:11.766
because Jason was shot
and I just left him there.

33:12.087 --> 33:13.910
Paige, I gotta get back.

33:14.010 --> 33:15.873
Yeah, we definitely need
to get out of here,

33:15.974 --> 33:17.977
but I think we need Piper to do that.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.808
Damn.

33:54.881 --> 33:58.046
You're gonna be okay.
We're almost there. Okay?

34:25.213 --> 34:26.755
Okay, I think they're gone.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.859
How are we gonna find Piper?

34:29.661 --> 34:31.764
I don't know, maybe try feeling her?

34:31.864 --> 34:34.768
The demon created these worlds
by using our emotions, right?

34:34.869 --> 34:37.995
I don't know, maybe use him as
a conduit to tap into her feelings.

34:38.436 --> 34:40.559
Okay, it's worth a shot.

34:42.483 --> 34:43.985
You getting anything?

34:44.085 --> 34:46.089
Oh, I'm smelling something...

34:51.257 --> 34:52.719
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

34:52.820 --> 34:55.103
- Okay, try again.
- Okay.

34:56.025 --> 34:58.009
- Over there.
- Okay.

34:58.109 --> 35:00.113
Go that way, man.
All right.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.845
- You okay?
- I feel her.

35:08.047 --> 35:10.170
She's really scared
and she needs our help.

35:14.337 --> 35:18.064
These worlds were fuelled
by our desires, right?

35:18.424 --> 35:20.047
Well, our desire is to find her.

35:20.147 --> 35:23.233
Okay, so maybe our combined
desires can actually...

35:23.553 --> 35:25.837
...bring us to her, right?
- Yeah.

35:28.402 --> 35:30.405
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Focus.

35:34.372 --> 35:36.275
You've ruined everything.

35:36.375 --> 35:39.220
Now they'll find the oldest sister
and come for me.

35:42.065 --> 35:44.109
Unless I get to her first.

36:08.390 --> 36:10.394
You're not demon enough to kill me.

36:11.676 --> 36:14.421
The sweetest desire of them all.

36:14.521 --> 36:16.524
The desire to survive.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.802
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's about time

36:26.902 --> 36:29.347
- you guys showed up.
- Athame!

36:30.028 --> 36:32.031
Yeah, sorry, no magic here.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.284
How does that shoulder feel?

36:44.653 --> 36:47.057
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out.

36:49.862 --> 36:51.885
There's nowhere to run.

36:51.986 --> 36:55.512
You're in my world!

37:11.780 --> 37:14.204
- Where are we?
- Who cares?

37:14.304 --> 37:16.047
- Where's Jason?
- Jason?

37:16.147 --> 37:18.371
Yeah, he was in my world
and he should have come out

37:18.471 --> 37:20.094
when we got the demon, right?

37:20.194 --> 37:23.340
- You sure it was really Jason?
- I don't know, what do you mean?

37:23.440 --> 37:26.405
In my world, there's all these people
that I knew in the old folks' home,

37:26.725 --> 37:29.470
maybe your Jason is just
a creation of your world.

37:29.570 --> 37:30.872
God, I hope so.

37:30.973 --> 37:33.437
Wyatt needs help.

37:33.537 --> 37:35.621
Oh, my God, so does he.

37:39.908 --> 37:42.553
- He's still breathing.
- Leo!

37:44.756 --> 37:46.059
You're back. Where were you?

37:46.159 --> 37:48.443
Heal now, ask later.

38:25.587 --> 38:27.250
His fever's down.

38:27.350 --> 38:28.892
He should sleep pretty well tonight.

38:28.993 --> 38:31.357
Yeah, he had quite a day.

38:32.959 --> 38:34.963
You're okay.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.853
Well, I'm glad you made it
out of that other world all right.

38:41.174 --> 38:44.700
Yeah, and you have Chris
to thank for that.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.403
Chris.

38:46.503 --> 38:49.167
Yeah, well, he should have
taken me with him to that cave,

38:49.267 --> 38:52.293
or at least told me
where my family was.

38:52.393 --> 38:54.176
Leo, give him a break.

38:54.276 --> 38:56.280
He earned it today.

38:58.083 --> 39:02.210
So, what about you? I heard your
social life was interrupted again.

39:02.610 --> 39:05.255
Yeah. But you know,
there's always tomorrow.

39:06.738 --> 39:09.542
- You never give up, do you?
- No. Not a chance.

39:10.384 --> 39:12.527
I firmly believe there will be one day

39:12.628 --> 39:15.993
without demons,
magic or pocket realms.

39:17.115 --> 39:18.658
Good night, Piper.

39:18.758 --> 39:22.164
Hey, before you go,
could you do me a favour?

39:26.211 --> 39:27.834
You want me to heal your hand?

39:27.934 --> 39:29.837
I thought you wanted a normal day.

39:29.937 --> 39:31.961
Yeah, I did.

39:32.061 --> 39:34.505
And apparently
that's not gonna be today.

39:44.042 --> 39:45.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:46.005 --> 39:49.211
- How are you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

39:50.613 --> 39:54.079
So it's almost time for
my hearing with the Elders.

39:54.179 --> 39:57.184
I thought I'd give you the pleasure
of taking me in personally.

39:57.906 --> 40:00.971
Yeah, well, maybe I'II...

40:01.071 --> 40:03.075
...just give you this instead.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.340
I don't understand.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.167
Neither do I.
Just take it before I change my mind.

40:13.573 --> 40:15.476
Thanks for trying to warn us
about the demon.

40:15.576 --> 40:17.660
We should have listened to you
in the first place.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.805
As long as you learned
something at the end of the day,

40:20.905 --> 40:23.349
that's all that matters. Right?

40:24.111 --> 40:26.114
Right.

40:37.534 --> 40:40.579
Hey, I got your message.
You sounded so...

40:40.940 --> 40:42.723
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

40:42.823 --> 40:44.446
I just needed to see you.

40:44.546 --> 40:46.549
And feel my back.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.394
- You're okay.
- My doctor will be pleased.

40:49.715 --> 40:53.401
Listen, now that I have you here,
I have a surprise for you.

40:54.122 --> 40:56.947
No, no, this is good. The station
manager's a friend of mine,

40:57.047 --> 40:58.951
and we got to talking about you.

40:59.051 --> 41:01.094
- Now, Phoebe...
- That's not what I want.

41:01.575 --> 41:04.300
- You don't know what I'm gonna say.
- Yeah, I think I do.

41:05.061 --> 41:07.786
And I appreciate the gesture.

41:08.748 --> 41:10.811
But I have everything I want right here.

41:10.911 --> 41:12.374
You do?

41:12.474 --> 41:14.477
Yeah, I do.

41:15.119 --> 41:17.262
You've got me, Jason Dean.

41:17.362 --> 41:19.366
I'm yours.

41:19.726 --> 41:21.750
So no more wooing.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.032
Okay, no more wooing.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.957
I guess I'll cancel our helicopter
to Carmel for dinner.

41:26.057 --> 41:28.662
No, no, no,
maybe a little bit more wooing.
