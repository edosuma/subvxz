35:46.005 --> 35:47.471
So your dumb ass thought

35:47.473 --> 35:49.540
that bringing them here
was actually a good idea?

35:49.542 --> 35:50.574
Yes!

[GROANS]

35:53.112 --> 35:55.092
These ain't no ordinary girls, man!

35:55.095 --> 35:57.615
Their father's like
Black Jesus to Freeland!

35:57.617 --> 35:59.016
You know damn well

35:59.018 --> 36:01.787
that you don't make a move
like this without permission.

See what I mean? It's
been, like, what, huh,

36:10.696 --> 36:12.748
at least five years since
I took over this place,

36:12.751 --> 36:15.799
and we ain't had no
violence here? Now look.

36:16.777 --> 36:18.143
Handle that.

36:18.627 --> 36:21.571
- Murk these girls and make them disappear.
- [CRYING]

36:21.574 --> 36:23.073

[EXHALES]

37:08.874 --> 37:10.887
Now you should at least
give a brother a moment

37:10.890 --> 37:12.947
to say something heroically clever.

37:14.827 --> 37:16.827
Now you've just pissed me off.

37:17.229 --> 37:18.540
Let's go, Jen!

Where's Lala?

37:38.552 --> 37:40.252
[SOBS] I don't know, man!

[GRUNTS]

37:46.601 --> 37:47.800

Do you believe in the
Resurrection, Latavious?

39:15.082 --> 39:17.514
- I asked you a question.
- [CONTINUES GROANING]

39:17.516 --> 39:19.431
Do you believe in the Resurrection?

39:19.434 --> 39:23.269
The concept itself is beautiful,
but it's a complete fantasy.

39:23.272 --> 39:24.655
I killed Black Lightning.

39:24.657 --> 39:26.657
- [GROANING]
- But it seems you and whoever this is

39:26.659 --> 39:30.967
have developed an adversarial
relationship that's bad for my business.

39:30.970 --> 39:32.763
[GROANING LOUDLY]

39:34.166 --> 39:38.272
My question is, can you
take care of this problem,

39:38.275 --> 39:42.697
or should I just kill you
now and solve it myself?
