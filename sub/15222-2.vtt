<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:04.655 --> 00:08.032
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.157 --> 00:09.868
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:14.623 --> 00:17.418
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:17.668 --> 00:20.587
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:20.671 --> 00:25.426
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.051 --> 00:30.556
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:30.639 --> 00:35.394
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:35.477 --> 00:39.648
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:39.773 --> 00:42.693

00:42.776 --> 00:45.571

02:12.366 --> 02:14.535
So you got a little Lee
Harvey Oswald in you.

02:14.618 --> 02:16.578
You can handle that.

02:17.621 --> 02:20.916
What if I got a lot of
Lee Harvey Oswald in me?

02:22.459 --> 02:24.294
What if I assassinate
the president?

02:24.378 --> 02:27.130
You're not gonna assassinate
the president. This is '57.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.132
That doesn't happen
for another six years.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.635
Fifteen minutes ago, it
was six years from now.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.554
And who's to say that's
not gonna happen again...

02:33.637 --> 02:37.641
Were you ever approached
by a foreign agent in Japan?

02:37.766 --> 02:39.643
Are you a foreign agent, Al?

02:41.728 --> 02:43.146
That's your name.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.691
How-How did I know your name?

02:45.732 --> 02:48.777
Wait. You didn't mention the Russians.
They were behind the assassination?

02:48.860 --> 02:50.153
That's one theory.

02:50.279 --> 02:52.948
Another one is that Oswald was just
pretending to be with the K.G.B.

02:53.031 --> 02:54.616
He was really with the C.I.A.
or the F.B.I.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.787
Wait. Wait. Wait. Why was the K.G.B.
even interested in Oswald?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.040
Oswald was a radar operator
with Macs-1.

03:02.124 --> 03:06.044
He knew all the frequencies,
all the codes, the intercept procedures.

03:06.128 --> 03:07.921
He's taking over my mind.

03:08.005 --> 03:11.049
Well, that's impossible.
He-He can't take over your mind.

03:11.133 --> 03:15.304
I'm reacting like him. I'm-I'm talking
like him. I'm thinking like him.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.181
I don't know where
he stops and I start, Al.

03:18.307 --> 03:22.644
When you told our consulate
that you wanted to defect, you said...

03:27.316 --> 03:30.819
"I am willing to share
all knowledge I acquired

03:30.902 --> 03:33.363
"in the United States
Marine Corps.

03:33.572 --> 03:36.825
"I do this to repudiate
my former country...

03:36.950 --> 03:40.370
"and to demonstrate
my loyalty to the Soviet Union."

03:41.830 --> 03:47.878
My first duty assignment
was with Macs-1 in Atsugi, Japan.

06:05.849 --> 06:08.185
I still don't get how you do this.

06:08.977 --> 06:12.147
Well, it-it-it is a little
difficult to explain.

06:13.398 --> 06:16.151
You think I'm too stupid
to understand?

06:17.027 --> 06:19.529
Well, nobody understands it,
except Dr. Beckett.

06:19.654 --> 06:21.031
Try me.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.241
Try you. Okay.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.995
Let's start with the string theory.
What's the string theory?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.790
String theory?

06:33.043 --> 06:38.381
It helped close the conceptual gulf
between relativity and quantum mechanics.

06:38.757 --> 06:42.135
It postulates that subatomic
particles are not points,

06:42.219 --> 06:44.930
but strings,
about one Planck length long.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.182
The rate at which strings
vibrate can generate

06:47.265 --> 06:49.726
the properties of
all known particles.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.189
Hmm? How did I know that?

06:59.778 --> 07:04.741
<i>Most of our time, we spent watching
for bogies out of China or North Korea.</i>

07:04.825 --> 07:10.455
However, occasionally we would run a plot
for, uh, Race Car.

07:10.956 --> 07:14.292
- Have you seen Race Car?
- Many times.

07:15.544 --> 07:18.171
Landings, taking off.

07:18.922 --> 07:21.383
It had long and droopy wings.

07:21.925 --> 07:23.844
The tips sagged...

07:23.969 --> 07:28.557
so that when it landed,
it sparked the runway.

07:31.393 --> 07:33.909
What is Race Car's
official designation?

07:34.104 --> 07:35.480
U-2.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.275
The "U" stands for utility.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.863
Our officers told us
it was a weather plane,

07:42.946 --> 07:45.156
but scuttlebutt
had it that it was a...

07:45.365 --> 07:49.661
a secret spy plane flying missions
over China and Russia.

07:51.413 --> 07:53.123
Is this Race Car?

07:59.293 --> 08:00.586
Yes.

08:03.466 --> 08:06.386
- Where'd you get this?
- From a friend.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.264
You have friends, don't you?

08:10.181 --> 08:11.683
No. Not really.

08:13.602 --> 08:16.313
- Not a girlfriend?
- Not anymore.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.858
We'll have to do something about
it, Lieutenant Guri, eh?

08:20.317 --> 08:21.651
Da.

08:21.943 --> 08:26.156
How high Race Car flew over,
uh, these missions?

08:26.406 --> 08:29.534
We estimated around angels 9-0.

08:29.618 --> 08:31.870
Oh, that's 30,000 meters.

08:32.203 --> 08:35.414
- And the range?
- I don't know that.

08:36.917 --> 08:40.044
It would stay out at least 12 hours,
sometimes more.

08:41.296 --> 08:45.300
But, of course, it could have landed
before returning to Atsugi,

08:46.009 --> 08:47.552
but I don't think so.

08:47.677 --> 08:51.014
Can you tell us about Race
Car radar-jamming equipment?

08:51.681 --> 08:53.350
Didn't know it had any.

08:53.850 --> 08:55.727
Photographic equipment?

08:57.471 --> 09:00.223
So you know nothing about Race
Car defensive capabilities?

09:00.315 --> 09:03.026
Uh, Sam?
Now Oswald is you.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.737
Can you give me any
performance figures on U-2?

09:05.820 --> 09:08.823
- I mean, he's not completely you.
- It had a short takeoff...

09:08.907 --> 09:10.825
But when I asked him
if he understood--

09:10.909 --> 09:12.619
around... 500 feet, no more.

09:12.744 --> 09:16.081
- Sam?
- He climbed out at about 45 degrees...

09:16.373 --> 09:21.711
through angels 4-5,
which was as high as our MPS-11 tracked.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.172
- What are you telling them?
- Anything else?

09:24.255 --> 09:26.758
- Code names and frequencies.
- No!

09:26.841 --> 09:31.221
We were Coffee Mill, and of
course, the U-2 was Race Car.

09:31.346 --> 09:32.889
Sam, zip it!

09:33.014 --> 09:37.477
We usually used 218.5
as our main channel.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.312
Now, Comrade Oswald.

09:39.437 --> 09:42.315
God! Now you're him and he's you.
Holy mackerel!

09:42.399 --> 09:46.111
Why don't you write all this
technical data down for us.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.032
No. No.
This evening after dinner.

09:51.116 --> 09:53.618
Eh, you stay at the Hotel
Berlin, are you not?

09:53.743 --> 09:55.036
I believe so.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.038
Yeah.
The food there is inedible.

09:57.122 --> 09:59.416
Why don't you ask your intourist guide,
uh, what's her name?

09:59.541 --> 10:00.583
Rimma Shirokova.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.794
Yeah. Tell Rimma Shirokova
to take you to Najinski's.

10:02.877 --> 10:07.007
They serve this wonderful venison with
a-with a mushroom stew. You would love it.

10:07.298 --> 10:10.760
And now, you would be so kind and
wait in the other room for a moment.

10:51.634 --> 10:55.722
Sam, I know Oswald is influencing
you, but this is ridiculous.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.856
- Al?
- Oh, it's about time.

11:04.954 --> 11:07.317
Hey, you gotta control
this Oswald stuff

11:07.400 --> 11:09.402
before you give away every
secret in the government.

11:09.527 --> 11:12.197
It just came out, okay?

11:12.280 --> 11:15.658
I think I could have stopped,
but some part of me that didn't want to.

11:15.784 --> 11:17.827
And you know about that part.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.208
Uh, I was just thinking out loud.

11:40.642 --> 11:42.268
How bad is it?

11:42.560 --> 11:44.771
It depends on how
much you told them.

11:45.021 --> 11:47.774
I think I told them everything
Oswald knew about the U-2.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.985
Gary Powers.

11:51.236 --> 11:53.321
The Russians shoot him
down next May.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.658
And that incident extends
the Cold War for years.

11:56.741 --> 11:58.743
That must be why I leaped in
here, Al.

11:58.827 --> 12:01.746
To stop the Soviets from
getting U-2 data from Oswald.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.790
Oh, no. Ziggy doesn't think so.

12:03.915 --> 12:08.795
There's a 96% probability that you didn't
give the Soviets anything on the U-2...

12:08.920 --> 12:10.421
that they didn't already have.

12:10.505 --> 12:12.090
But they shoot Powers
down, right?

12:12.173 --> 12:14.926
Yeah. It was just a lucky shot
with a Sam-2. A 100-to-1 shot.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.972
It had nothing to do with anything
you-- uh, Oswald told them.

12:19.055 --> 12:20.640
Thank God.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.601
Well, then why am I here in Russia?

12:24.060 --> 12:27.063
Ziggy's working on it.
I personally think it had some--

12:27.147 --> 12:28.940
You think it has something
to do with the conspiracy?

12:28.975 --> 12:30.143
Yeah.

12:30.168 --> 12:32.527
Why don't you change that record, okay?
Well, I still believe it.

12:32.610 --> 12:38.032
Al, in all of these leaps so far,
we haven't uncovered any conspiracy,

12:38.158 --> 12:41.411
and we have not proven
that Oswald was not the assassin.

12:41.536 --> 12:42.912
Well, maybe this one will.

12:43.037 --> 12:45.540
Yeah. But I can't keep wandering
around leap after leap like this.

12:45.623 --> 12:48.459
We gotta-- We gotta take
the initiative somehow!

12:48.543 --> 12:50.962
Right!
Well, what do we do?

12:54.257 --> 12:57.093
Oh, you're not becoming
Oswald again, are you?

12:57.177 --> 13:00.430
I don't actually... become Oswald.

13:00.555 --> 13:04.767
I just sort of drift along next to him
and his thoughts come out.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.187
Oh, you're not drifting, are you?

13:08.438 --> 13:11.649
No. I'm theorizing.
Or trying to.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.651
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

13:14.068 --> 13:15.445
I was just thinking though,

13:15.528 --> 13:18.239
what if I prematurely exited
that first leap into Oswald?

13:18.278 --> 13:19.827
The one where Marina
took your picture?

13:19.903 --> 13:21.868
Yeah. What if I leaped
out before I had a chance

13:21.894 --> 13:23.369
to put right what
once went wrong?

13:23.453 --> 13:26.039
Well, success doesn't have
anything to do with leaping.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.625
I said before I had a chance
to undo the wrong?

13:28.708 --> 13:30.585
Why would you leap before
you had the chance?

13:30.668 --> 13:33.171
If I knew that, I'd know how
to get off this leaping yo-yo

13:33.296 --> 13:35.632
so I could do whatever it
was I was supposed to do.

13:35.757 --> 13:39.223
- Which is stop the assassination.
- Well, let's hope that's it.

13:39.928 --> 13:43.389
Sam, Ziggy says
you're on the right track.

13:43.514 --> 13:46.476
It's just gonna take time
to test your hypothesis,

13:46.559 --> 13:49.229
but you should continue
and play this scenario out.

13:49.312 --> 13:51.314
- Like I got a big choice.
- I didn't finish.

13:51.397 --> 13:54.442
But you gotta play it out just the
way Oswald did. No changing history.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.528
- So tell me what I'm supposed to do.
- You go to your hotel room.

13:57.612 --> 13:58.780
Yeah.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.617
And then before you have dinner
with your intourist guide...

14:04.744 --> 14:06.663
you commit suicide.

14:16.714 --> 14:19.384
- I don't like this, Al.
- I don't like it either.

14:19.509 --> 14:22.887
But Ziggy insists that you continue
doing exactly what Oswald did...

14:22.971 --> 14:26.015
on October 21, 1959.

14:26.349 --> 14:29.227
Which means that
in a couple of minutes,

14:29.352 --> 14:32.647
you have to slash your left wrist
with a razor blade.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.524
Yeah. Well, maybe we
should just skip that part.

14:34.649 --> 14:36.276
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?

14:36.401 --> 14:37.986
Well, you're not gonna die.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.072
- How can you be so sure?
- Because Oswald didn't.

14:41.155 --> 14:43.658
- Olga saved him.
- Olga? Who's Olga?

14:43.741 --> 14:45.660
Your intourist guide.

14:45.910 --> 14:49.706
Wait a second. I thought that, uh,
Major Kosenko said that somebody--

14:49.789 --> 14:51.833
that her name was
Rimma something, right?

14:51.958 --> 14:53.835
- Shirokova.
- Shirokova something.

14:53.918 --> 14:56.504
Yeah, but Oswald called
her Olga in his diaries,

14:56.587 --> 14:58.715
and maybe that was his
nickname for Rimma.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.758
And maybe I've already
altered history

15:00.842 --> 15:03.761
and nobody named Olga or Rimma
or-or any name like that...

15:03.886 --> 15:06.097
is gonna come through that
door after I slash my wrist!

15:06.180 --> 15:07.974
Okay. Well, maybe not.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.311
For all we know you may be here to
stop Oswald from slashing his wrist.

15:11.436 --> 15:12.895
- Let's see.
- Exactly.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.647
Uh, okay,

15:14.731 --> 15:18.943
if Oswald doesn't attempt suicide,
the Russians kick him out of the country.

15:19.027 --> 15:20.695
He never meets Marina--

15:20.820 --> 15:22.655
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

15:22.739 --> 15:24.657
The Russians kick him
out of the country?

15:24.741 --> 15:27.452
Yeah. Oswald's six-day
visa expires tonight...

15:27.577 --> 15:29.579
and the Russians
won't extend it.

15:29.704 --> 15:32.165
Maybe that's why
he attempted suicide.

15:32.248 --> 15:35.084
Doesn't that kinda blow
your K.G.B. conspiracy theory?

15:35.168 --> 15:39.297
Well, maybe.
But it reinforces my C.I.A. theory.

15:39.380 --> 15:42.800
Because if Oswald was C.I.A., the
Russians wouldn't want him in the country.

15:42.884 --> 15:45.803
So that's why he commits suicide, right?
Because it's in the C.I.A. manual.

15:45.887 --> 15:48.431
- What difference does it make?
- What difference does it make?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.600
We're talkin' about trying
to find the truth out here.

15:50.683 --> 15:55.521
And what if the truth is that at age 19,
Oswald was not a C.I.A. agent,

15:55.646 --> 15:57.440
he was not a K.G.B. agent.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.360
Maybe he was just some-some
frustrated loser, right,

16:00.443 --> 16:02.278
who was trying to get
recognition any way he could.

16:02.403 --> 16:04.739
Maybe he thought the best
way to do that was by defecting.

16:04.822 --> 16:06.657
But then when the Soviets
didn't want him,

16:06.741 --> 16:08.534
he didn't have anybody
else, so he slit his wrists.

16:08.618 --> 16:10.119
No. Uh-uh. No, no.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.497
See, the Russians wanted
defectors in '59.

16:12.580 --> 16:16.334
I cannot believe that the
Russians had Lee Harvey Oswald

16:16.417 --> 16:18.628
on an "A" list for defectors.

16:18.753 --> 16:20.213
I mean, he was a kid, right?

16:20.296 --> 16:22.757
If I remember correctly,
he never even graduated high school.

16:22.831 --> 16:25.051
- Not exactly the kind...
- Sam.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.796
of disillusioned
American intellectual or scientist,

16:27.821 --> 16:30.307
that the Soviets like to parade
in front of the world press, right?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.891
- Sam.
- He's not anything like that at all.

16:32.016 --> 16:35.728
- Sam, it's time.
- What? Time--

16:39.190 --> 16:40.400
to commit suicide?

16:40.483 --> 16:44.237
No, not commit suicide.
Attempt suicide! Attempt! Attempt!

16:45.029 --> 16:49.158
Now all we have to do
is follow Oswald's diary.

16:50.868 --> 16:53.621
Let's see. October 21.

16:53.955 --> 16:55.957
Okay. Um,

16:56.165 --> 16:59.460
"I must leave country
at 8:00 p.m. tonight...

16:59.585 --> 17:03.714
"as visa has 'expird.'"

17:04.549 --> 17:07.926
He spells "expire"
without the "E." Hmm.

17:08.051 --> 17:10.512
"I am shocked!
My dreams!

17:10.637 --> 17:14.392
"I retire to my room.
I have $100 left.

17:14.474 --> 17:19.814
"I have waited for two year
to be accepted.

17:19.981 --> 17:25.479
"My 'fondis', F-O-N-D-I-S,
uh, dreams are shattered...

17:25.611 --> 17:28.906
"because of a petty official,
because of bad planning,"

17:29.031 --> 17:31.284
uh, "I have planned so much.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.036
"7:00 p.m.
I decide to end it.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.038
"Slash 'rist' R-I-S-T."

17:36.122 --> 17:38.332
I don't care how he spells it.
I'm not gonna do it.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.376
- Oh, well, you have to.
- I'm not.

17:40.460 --> 17:46.674
Uh, "soak 'rist' in cold water
to numb the pain.

17:47.091 --> 17:50.428
"Then slash my left 'rist.'

17:50.545 --> 17:55.141
"Then I 'plaug.' Plaug? Plaug?
What the hell is a plaug?

17:55.224 --> 17:57.560
Who cares what it is?
Al, I'm not gonna do it.

17:57.643 --> 18:03.733
Okay. All right. Wait a minute.
"Plaug rist into bathtub of hot water.

18:03.983 --> 18:09.614
"I think when Olga comes at 8:00
to find me dead will be a big shock.

18:10.490 --> 18:15.453
"Somewhere... a violin plays."

20:13.112 --> 20:15.406
Easy, fella.

20:55.696 --> 20:57.031
Marina?

21:06.123 --> 21:09.669
"If I am alive and they have captured me,

21:09.835 --> 21:14.173
"I believe that the embassy
will come to your assistance."

21:18.552 --> 21:20.888
Well, you don't need this, do you?

21:32.108 --> 21:35.986
<i>The administration increased its crackdown
on Cuban exile hit-and-run raids.</i>

21:36.278 --> 21:39.990
<i>The raids based from Mexico, the Caribbean
and the southern United States...</i>

21:40.074 --> 21:41.951
<i>are a stumbling block-</i>

21:50.918 --> 21:52.628
I shot a man.

21:57.758 --> 22:00.886
I don't know if I hit him or not.

22:03.848 --> 22:05.975
It should be on the news.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.736
General Walker.

22:18.195 --> 22:22.491
That-That must be why I-I
left you that note.

22:23.826 --> 22:25.661
In case they caught me.

22:30.332 --> 22:31.959
But they didn't.

22:36.005 --> 22:37.923
I'm too smart for them.

22:45.973 --> 22:49.226
He was a fascist, like Hitler.

22:49.894 --> 22:51.437
Don't you see?

22:53.856 --> 22:57.193
If someone had killed Hitler
before he came to power,

22:57.818 --> 23:00.070
millions of lives
would have been saved.

23:05.576 --> 23:07.203
Yes, you can.

23:10.206 --> 23:12.041
He lived alone.

23:16.754 --> 23:18.631
I'm listening to the radio!

23:20.214 --> 23:24.470
Sam. Sam, it worked.
It worked.

23:24.553 --> 23:28.641
It... almost worked.
It's April 10, 1963.

23:28.766 --> 23:30.935
And that's only a month after
your original leap into Oswald.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.938
If I killed him, there should be
something on the radio.

23:34.438 --> 23:35.981
Killed him?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.151
- I buried it.
- Killed who?

23:39.235 --> 23:41.111
Wrapped it in that
raincoat and I buried it.

23:41.195 --> 23:42.655
Gooshie!

23:42.780 --> 23:44.824
What the hell's he talking about?

23:45.449 --> 23:47.827
Holy mackerel!
Sam, you leaped into Oswald...

23:47.952 --> 23:51.163
just seconds after he tried to blow
General Edwin Walker's head off.

23:51.247 --> 23:55.209
- Tried? Tried? I missed?
- Not you. Oswald!

23:55.334 --> 23:58.003
The bullet splintered the window
and then punched into the wall

23:58.087 --> 24:00.005
just inches above Walker's head.

24:00.130 --> 24:01.882
It was an easy shot.

24:02.716 --> 24:05.845
He was just sitting there
working at his desk.

24:06.595 --> 24:07.930
How could I miss?

24:08.055 --> 24:10.766
You didn't miss him, Sam!
Oswald did!

24:10.850 --> 24:12.893
You don't have to yell, Al.
I can hear you.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.434
Oh! Oh.

24:15.563 --> 24:20.025
Well, that's better.
Sam, you're scaring the hell out of me.

24:21.235 --> 24:22.987
Uh, you were acting--

24:23.070 --> 24:27.575
you were acting like Oswald's
mind was still merged into yours.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.744
<i>President Kennedy's popularity
slipping from the high it showed...</i>

24:30.870 --> 24:32.746
<i>during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</i>

24:33.080 --> 24:35.416
- <i>The White House confirmed plans--</i>
- It is.

24:35.541 --> 24:39.628
- No, it can't be.
- Only this time it's different.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.298
No, but Ziggy said it
would be gone.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.675
Yeah? Why would it be gone?

24:44.758 --> 24:48.387
Well, Ziggy computed that the
reason that you were leaping

24:48.470 --> 24:50.180
back and forth in
Oswald's life...

24:50.306 --> 24:52.266
was because the part of
your mind that's in him

24:52.349 --> 24:55.352
and the part of his mind that's in
you were trying to, uh, reunite.

24:56.303 --> 24:59.097
- So, what did you do?
- I didn't do-- I didn't-- Nothin'.

24:59.189 --> 25:02.651
Ziggy is-- Well, Ziggy figured that
if we could reconnect your minds,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.486
then we could get the leap
back on track.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.739
So through, uh, D.N.A. typing,

25:06.822 --> 25:12.411
Ziggy identified, you know, the little
mesons and neurons in Oswald's brain...

25:12.494 --> 25:15.205
that biologically matched yours,
and then we put Oswald in the accelerator

25:15.289 --> 25:17.291
and we leaped those
little things back to you.

25:17.374 --> 25:19.752
You can't leap isolated
mesons and neurons

25:19.835 --> 25:22.838
without drawing other
neural energy with it.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.757
- More neural energy?
- Yeah.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.926
Sucking up more
of Oswald's mind.

25:27.051 --> 25:28.969
That's why this leap is different.
There's more of him in me.

25:29.053 --> 25:30.596
More?

25:31.639 --> 25:33.182
There's more?

25:52.242 --> 25:53.911
I can't destroy this.

25:54.036 --> 25:56.789
- This is my plan.
- Oh, no, Sam.

26:00.918 --> 26:03.671
I planned this like
a military operation.

26:04.964 --> 26:09.259
Reconnaissance photos,
time tables, escape routes.

26:10.594 --> 26:14.640
Even my political justification
for the execution.

26:14.682 --> 26:17.935
- Sam. Sam, look at me.
- It should have worked.

26:18.018 --> 26:19.561
Sam, look at me!

26:19.687 --> 26:21.438
My aim was perfect.

26:24.441 --> 26:26.694
It was an accident that I missed.

26:28.487 --> 26:31.782
He dropped his head at the last second,
or he'd be dead.

26:32.449 --> 26:34.118
He'd be dead,

26:34.535 --> 26:37.705
and the world would remember
Lee Harvey Oswald...

26:38.205 --> 26:43.085
as the man who executed
General Edwin Walker.

26:48.590 --> 26:50.217
"Hands off Cuba."

26:54.054 --> 26:57.558
Hands off Cuba. Hands off Cuba!

26:58.058 --> 27:00.269
Hands off Cuba!

27:00.686 --> 27:01.829
Hands off Cuba!

27:01.854 --> 27:03.862
Oh, I don't truck with
communist propaganda.

27:03.981 --> 27:06.275
What makes you think this
is communist propaganda?

27:06.358 --> 27:09.445
Oh, because everybody know
that Castro is a communist.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.323
I'm not Castro.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.458
No. But y'all are supportin'
him, aren't you?

27:15.534 --> 27:17.119
No. I'm supporting Cuba.

27:18.078 --> 27:19.913
Although,
I must admit that I admire him...

27:20.039 --> 27:21.999
the same way I admire
George Washington.

27:22.082 --> 27:23.709
Ellie, we only have a half hour.

27:24.835 --> 27:27.337
Y'all are comparing Fidel Castro
to George Washington?

27:27.421 --> 27:31.216
Uh-huh. Castro is doing
what Washington did,

27:31.300 --> 27:33.177
leading his country
in a revolution.

27:33.302 --> 27:35.763
- It's not the same.
- No?

27:35.838 --> 27:37.399
- No!
- Well, why not?

27:37.444 --> 27:38.606
I don't know.

27:38.631 --> 27:40.309
- It's just not the same.
- Ellie!

27:40.434 --> 27:44.313
- I'll be right there.
- I'll order you a salad.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.409
Gee, I don't want you
to miss your lunch.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.442
Oh, it'll be good for my figure.

27:51.445 --> 27:54.823
Uh, so how do you equate the
American Revolution with,

27:54.907 --> 27:57.034
uh, the communist
takeover in Cuba?

27:57.159 --> 27:58.994
We kicked out King George.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.498
Castro kicked out Batiste.
It seems the same to me.

28:02.623 --> 28:05.250
- But it's not. Castro is a communist.
- Hands off Cuba.

28:05.375 --> 28:08.378
Well, whatever he is,
Castro just wants Cuba to have...

28:08.462 --> 28:11.090
the same opportunity
for self-determination that we did.

28:11.173 --> 28:14.760
- Hands off Cuba.
- Y'all sound like you know him.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.845
We've had the same teacher.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.973
Would you like to join
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?

28:20.224 --> 28:22.226
I'm secretary of
the New Orleans chapter.

28:22.309 --> 28:27.231
I could sign you up right now
for only a dollar and a quarter.

28:28.565 --> 28:30.234
Y'all have social functions?

28:30.317 --> 28:33.403
Well, now, we don't.
But that is an awful good idea.

28:33.487 --> 28:36.365
More folks will come to a dance
than will come to a political meeting.

28:36.907 --> 28:38.992
Course, once you got 'em in there--

28:39.368 --> 28:43.080
You are something, Ellie.
You are really something.

28:43.372 --> 28:45.666
Hey, you know my name,
but I don't know yours.

28:45.749 --> 28:47.584
I only know half your name.

28:48.377 --> 28:52.131
The other half's La Forge.
Ellie La Forge.

28:52.256 --> 28:54.007
Ellie La Forge.

28:55.217 --> 28:58.178
Hidell. Alex Hidell.

29:03.183 --> 29:07.771
- Y'all are married.
- Yes. My wife lives in Dallas.

29:08.605 --> 29:10.858
Y'all didn't tell me
y'all were married.

29:14.236 --> 29:16.405
Fair play for Cuba!

29:17.156 --> 29:19.491
Fair play for Cuba!

29:20.075 --> 29:22.202
Fair play for Cuba!

29:22.786 --> 29:24.913
Fair play for Cuba!

29:25.038 --> 29:27.833
- Traitor! Traitor!
- Fair play for Cuba!

29:27.916 --> 29:30.210
You see this fellow.
He is a communist.

29:30.294 --> 29:32.421
- Fair play for Cuba!
- Communist!

29:32.546 --> 29:36.967
And he wants to do to your country
what he did to us in Cuba!

29:37.092 --> 29:38.969
- Fair play for Cuba!
- Communist!

29:39.094 --> 29:42.723
Gooshie, you got a lock on him?
Now just hold it there-- Uh-oh!

29:42.848 --> 29:45.017
A couple of days ago,
he tried to join us.

29:45.100 --> 29:49.438
He said he wanted to fight for Cuba!
To bring down Castro!

29:49.563 --> 29:52.649
- Liar!
- Okay, Carlos.

29:53.108 --> 29:56.069
If you want to hit me, hit me.

29:56.145 --> 29:58.363
- He's doing exactly what Oswald did!
- With pleasure.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.115
Freeze!
Up against the wall and spread 'em!

30:00.199 --> 30:01.408
He's a communist!

30:01.491 --> 30:04.036
- Up against the wall and shut up!
- Sam, can you hear me?

30:04.119 --> 30:06.413
It's the 9th of August, 1963.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.166
There's only three months until
the Kennedy assassination,

30:09.257 --> 30:11.601
Sam, and each leap is
putting you closer.

30:12.711 --> 30:17.090
If you leap into Dallas on November 22
and Oswald is still in control,

30:17.216 --> 30:19.468
you won't be able to
change anything, Sam!

30:19.551 --> 30:21.595
You've got to fight him!
Fight him, Sam!

30:21.720 --> 30:23.430
What's your name, boy?

30:25.140 --> 30:28.518
- My name?
- Dr. Samuel Beckett!

30:31.021 --> 30:33.440
My name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

30:36.894 --> 30:38.896
<i>Three years ago, I said that, uh,</i>

30:38.987 --> 30:41.531
<i>introduced myself in Paris
by saying that I was the man...</i>

30:41.615 --> 30:43.909
<i>who had accompanied,
uh, Mrs. Kennedy to Paris.</i>

30:44.034 --> 30:46.245
<i>I'm getting, uh,
somewhat that same sensation,</i>

30:46.328 --> 30:48.622
<i>uh, as I travel
around, uh, Texas.</i>

30:51.833 --> 30:54.503
<i>Nobody wonders
what Lyndon and I wear.</i>

31:07.391 --> 31:10.143
<i>I'm glad to be here in,
uh, Jim Wright's city.</i>

31:10.560 --> 31:12.729
<i>About, uh, 35, uh--</i>

31:17.276 --> 31:19.736
<i>I appreciate your being
here this morning.</i>

31:19.820 --> 31:23.282
<i>Mrs. Kennedy is
organizing herself.</i>

31:23.365 --> 31:25.242
<i>It takes longer.</i>

31:26.910 --> 31:29.496
<i>That's because she looks
better than we do.</i>

34:24.920 --> 34:26.672
Looks like it's gonna rain.

34:30.594 --> 34:32.094
What's in the package?

34:33.013 --> 34:34.806
Curtain rods.

34:58.955 --> 35:02.334
Ziggy computes the best option under
the circumstances is to do nothing.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.544
Well, Ziggy doesn't want to
make another mistake.

35:04.628 --> 35:07.923
Perhaps. But if Dr. Beckett leaped
into Oswald to uncover the conspiracy,

35:08.006 --> 35:10.258
then doing nothing is an
effective course of action.

35:10.342 --> 35:11.885
How the hell do you figure that?

35:11.968 --> 35:15.138
Whether Dr. Beckett is himself
or Lee Harvey Oswald is immaterial.

35:15.263 --> 35:18.308
Either way, you'll be there to observe,
to watch the sixth floor window,

35:18.433 --> 35:20.393
the grassy knoll,
the railroad overpass.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.604
You'll see it all.
You'll know the truth.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.356
But I won't be able to stop it.

35:24.473 --> 35:27.108
I realize that, Admiral,
but you yourself said that wasn't what

35:27.192 --> 35:28.735
Dr. Beckett was
leaped back to do.

35:28.818 --> 35:30.070
Well, what if I was wrong?

35:30.195 --> 35:32.948
What if that's precisely the
reason that Sam was leaped back?

35:33.031 --> 35:34.741
Then Oswald would have
to be the sole assassin.

35:34.866 --> 35:35.867
That's right.

35:35.992 --> 35:37.452
No conspiracy?
No!

35:37.577 --> 35:42.832
Just one angry, envious man who--
who wanted to propel himself into infamy.

35:42.916 --> 35:44.584
But one lone man?

35:44.709 --> 35:47.379
I know it's more comforting
to believe in plots.

35:47.504 --> 35:50.757
Because if Kennedy could be
killed that easily by one sicko,

35:50.840 --> 35:52.634
what hope is there
for the rest of us?

35:52.717 --> 35:54.719
Admiral, what are you gonna do?

35:54.886 --> 35:57.013
I'm gonna try and find the truth.

36:06.439 --> 36:07.983
Hey, Lee.

36:09.859 --> 36:11.695
What's the hurry?

36:31.464 --> 36:34.384
<i>The morning overcast
has given way to blue skies...</i>

36:34.467 --> 36:36.469
<i>and the local democratic
party is predicting</i>

36:36.595 --> 36:38.329
<i>a record-breaking
big "D" turnout...</i>

36:38.388 --> 36:40.682
<i>for President Kennedy
and his first lady.</i>

36:40.765 --> 36:43.602
<i>Mrs. Kennedy has been given
a large bouquet of roses...</i>

36:43.685 --> 36:45.687
<i>by admirers here in Love Field...</i>

36:45.812 --> 36:48.773
<i>as she and the president
stopped to greet this crowd,</i>

36:48.898 --> 36:51.443
<i>which is completely
covering the airport fence.</i>

36:51.568 --> 36:54.070
<i>This motorcade will
get off to a late start.</i>

36:54.154 --> 36:57.240
<i>There are just too many people
here in an amazing display</i>

36:57.324 --> 36:59.367
<i>of goodwill to the Kennedys.</i>

37:39.658 --> 37:42.202
<i>I think I'm gonna go down there
and catch some of that parade.</i>

37:43.453 --> 37:45.747
I admire the
president very much.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.540
You admire him,
but you're going to kill him.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.710
That's what this is about. You're Secret
Service and you're detaining me...

37:50.835 --> 37:52.837
because you think I'm going to
shoot the president!

37:52.962 --> 37:55.006
I know you're gonna
shoot the president.

37:55.131 --> 37:58.009
What I want to know is:
Are you acting alone?

37:58.551 --> 38:00.470
I don't even own a gun!

38:00.553 --> 38:03.431
You own a 6.5 millimeter
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle

38:03.556 --> 38:05.392
and an S&W .38 Special.

38:05.475 --> 38:08.103
The rifle is wrapped in a blanket
at Ruth Paine's house...

38:08.228 --> 38:11.731
and the pistol is at your rooming house
at 1026 North Beckley!

38:11.815 --> 38:16.778
You ordered both of these guns through the
mail under the alias of Alex J. Hidell.

38:17.612 --> 38:21.866
- Marina. She told you these lies.
- Marina told me nothing.

38:21.991 --> 38:25.495
But when questioned, she'll talk about
the shot you took at General Walker,

38:25.578 --> 38:29.332
and she'll talk about locking you in the
bathroom when Nixon came to Dallas...

38:29.457 --> 38:31.835
'cause she was afraid you were
gonna try and shoot him too.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.211
I want a lawyer.

38:33.336 --> 38:36.256
There's no lawyer here.
There's just me and you and the truth.

38:36.423 --> 38:40.218
I know my rights.
I'm a member of the A.C.L.U., and I have--

38:41.469 --> 38:44.472
You're going to shoot the president
from the sixth-floor window

38:44.597 --> 38:46.891
of the Texas School
Book Depository.

38:47.016 --> 38:49.957
- You're crazy!
- Yeah, you're damn right I'm crazy.

38:50.068 --> 38:53.530
I'm crazy enough to blow your brains out
your ear if I don't get the truth.

39:02.866 --> 39:05.452
<i>A large police escort is now--</i>

39:11.958 --> 39:13.835
What color is her suit?

39:18.590 --> 39:21.634
<i>And now ticker tape is beginning
to flow from the windows</i>

39:21.760 --> 39:23.678
<i>and engulf the whole motorcade.</i>

39:23.845 --> 39:25.972
<i>Here comes the first car
with the police chief,</i>

39:26.055 --> 39:28.892
<i>and here is the president
of the United States.</i>

39:29.017 --> 39:31.394
<i>The crowd is going absolutely wild.</i>

39:31.478 --> 39:34.439
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas...</i>

39:34.522 --> 39:37.734
<i>as the president
and the first lady pass by.</i>

39:38.443 --> 39:42.238
<i>There were some fears of demonstrations
here in downtown Dallas,</i>

39:42.363 --> 39:45.533
<i>but this crowd is radiating love
to the president.</i>

39:45.617 --> 39:48.453
<i>Dallas Police Department
is working with some force</i>

39:48.536 --> 39:50.663
<i>to ensure that an
unfortunate incident,</i>

39:50.747 --> 39:53.917
<i>similar to those that accompanied U.N.
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:55.877
<i>do not occur on this trip.</i>

39:55.960 --> 39:59.464
I don't believe in killing someone just
because I disagree with their politics.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.716
Are you acting alone?

40:01.841 --> 40:03.802
I want a lawyer--

40:04.928 --> 40:07.430
I'm deaf! I'm deaf!

40:07.514 --> 40:09.933
You're going to be dead in a minute
if you don't tell me the truth!

40:10.058 --> 40:12.560
Okay. Okay.
Don't hurt me.

40:13.895 --> 40:16.272
I'm not gonna shoot the president.

40:16.648 --> 40:20.401
- But... I know who is.
- Who?

40:22.779 --> 40:24.322
Hidell.

40:25.198 --> 40:27.742
The guy who ordered the guns
through the mail.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.619
He's the one who--

40:34.123 --> 40:36.543
- I'm lying, Al.
- Sam.

40:36.626 --> 40:38.711
There is no conspiracy.

40:39.045 --> 40:42.715
I'm acting alone,
and you've got to stop me.

40:43.424 --> 40:45.009
But I can't reach you, Sam.

40:45.093 --> 40:46.845
- He's taken over completely.
- You have to.

40:46.970 --> 40:50.181
You have to or it's gonna
happen all over again.

40:50.306 --> 40:52.225
You have to find...

40:54.602 --> 40:56.062
Hidell.

40:58.273 --> 41:00.775
Find Alex J. Hidell.

41:02.235 --> 41:04.863
That's the man who's gonna
shoot the president.

41:17.458 --> 41:21.880
Sam!
Sam, listen to me! Sam!

41:23.506 --> 41:25.174
I've got to reach you, Sam!

41:27.719 --> 41:30.388
Sam, what are the four
fundamental forces

41:30.471 --> 41:33.057
of interactions in
quantum physics?

41:33.808 --> 41:35.351
Sam.

41:35.852 --> 41:39.814
Sam, explain
the Pauli exclusion principle.

41:42.108 --> 41:46.321
Sam, what is supersymmetry?
And how does it apply--

41:47.447 --> 41:50.116
This is never gonna work.
It's all happening again.

41:50.199 --> 41:54.037
It's November 22, 1963,
and it's all happening again!

42:00.418 --> 42:03.713
Sam! Sam!
It's November 22, 1963!

42:04.047 --> 42:08.259
Sam, and your dad is still alive!
He's teaching you to drive a tractor, Sam.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.555
It's-It's Elkridge, Indiana.
You're 10 years old,

42:12.639 --> 42:15.404
and your dad is teaching
you to drive a tractor.

42:15.808 --> 42:18.144
At this very moment,
your dad is still alive

42:18.269 --> 42:20.855
and he's teaching you
to drive a tractor, Sam!

42:24.067 --> 42:26.819
On the farm in Indiana!

42:27.612 --> 42:29.489
He's still alive!

42:32.575 --> 42:33.952
Dad.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.549
No!

43:13.992 --> 43:16.619
<i>Just now we have received
reports here at Parkland...</i>

43:16.703 --> 43:19.664
<i>that Governor Connelly
was shot in the upper left chest...</i>

43:19.747 --> 43:24.085
<i>and the first unconfirmed reports
say the president was hit in the head.</i>

43:24.168 --> 43:28.673
<i>I repeat, an unconfirmed report
that the president was hit in the head.</i>

43:28.756 --> 43:33.261
<i>The president's wife, Jackie Kennedy,
was not hurt. She walked into the hospital.</i>

43:33.553 --> 43:35.179
Thanks, Al.

43:37.223 --> 43:39.183
If you hadn't reached me,

43:40.977 --> 43:42.687
I would have shot--

43:42.770 --> 43:46.315
No, it wouldn't have been you pulling
that trigger, Sam. Not really.

43:46.816 --> 43:48.526
And then when I...

43:49.402 --> 43:52.655
I had a chance to save him,
I leaped.

43:53.698 --> 43:56.159
Why, Al? Why?

43:56.284 --> 43:58.541
Oswald's mind
finally reconnected.

43:58.666 --> 44:00.621
And when it did, he leaped back

44:00.830 --> 44:04.250
and you leaped into the nearest person
that could accomplish your mission.

44:04.333 --> 44:08.046
- But I didn't accomplish it.
- Well, maybe you did.

44:08.129 --> 44:09.922
I didn't save him.

44:10.131 --> 44:15.595
No. But it doesn't look like
that's what you were here to do.

44:17.638 --> 44:20.975
Ziggy thinks you
were here to save her.

44:21.059 --> 44:25.521
Your Swiss-cheesed mind probably
doesn't remember, but the first time...

44:25.646 --> 44:28.608
Oswald killed Jackie too.
