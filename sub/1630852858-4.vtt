00:18.518 --> 00:19.352
Souta?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.355
Souta?

00:25.233 --> 00:27.235
You don't understand anything.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.386
Saya.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.265
Saya!

00:59.309 --> 01:01.102
Sleep on the bed.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.899
Answer me, at least.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.734
Hey.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.204
On your way home,
buy me a shochu highball.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.566
How do you like it?
Feels nice, doesn't it?

01:48.650 --> 01:49.526
Yeah.

01:53.905 --> 01:54.739
Saya.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.745
Hey, wait a minute.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.791
Souta, you can do it!

02:06.042 --> 02:07.377
You're going too fast.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.381
How am I supposed to keep up?
You used to run track.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.091
Sorry, sorry.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.390
I can't do it.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.767
It's okay.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.061
It'll feel better before long. Here.

02:27.021 --> 02:27.897
Here!

02:29.357 --> 02:31.526
Come on, Souta, you can do it!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
You're still here?

02:55.133 --> 02:58.136
I told you to break up with him, didn't I?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.849
Do you understand where you stand?

03:05.727 --> 03:08.187
- Infidelity is just disgusting.
- Ran!

03:10.481 --> 03:13.234
- You won't get any of our money.
- Ran, stop it.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.653
Haruto isn't connected
to Father's company anymore.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.239
He's not coming home.
He's just a goldfish seller.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.200
- You still want to be with him?
- I said stop.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.118
But…

03:23.661 --> 03:25.163
Don't come here anymore.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.084
Because I'm a Kazama?

03:32.128 --> 03:34.964
In that case, I'll leave home, too.
Let me live here.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.717
- You know we can't do that.
- Why not?

03:39.093 --> 03:41.179
Because you're living
with a married woman?

03:43.932 --> 03:44.807
Ran.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.811
Don't give me trouble. Please.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.409
I'm sorry.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.209
Well, don't pay any mind to what she said.
Just forget it.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.790
Can you believe that the new location
won't be open on time?

04:51.874 --> 04:54.168
Not surprising with Nene.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.130
Yeah, if only Sakura was here.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.683
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.518
No, nothing.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.902
Okay…

05:24.907 --> 05:28.077
Sorry! I didn't notice you there.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.205
HIRAGA TOKYO

05:31.289 --> 05:32.373
I'm sorry.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.635
They have over 100 different kinds.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.013
Really? Wow.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.850
It has such a pronounced scent,
I just love it.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.102
I can't wait to check it out.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.521
Hello.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.691
- Hello…
- Ms. Sanada.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.780
We're going to go out for tea.
Would you like to join us?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.997
I have some things to do.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.377
What's with that? How unpleasant!

06:18.961 --> 06:21.964
Ms. Sanada is on the third floor, right?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.425
Wouldn't the stairs be faster?

06:24.509 --> 06:27.261
You're right! The elevator is so slow.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.381
- Hello?
- Mr. Sanada?

07:04.423 --> 07:05.675
This is Sakaki.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.385
Yes, hello.

07:07.969 --> 07:14.267
I have something to ask you
about the marathon camp.

07:14.976 --> 07:15.935
What is it?

07:20.898 --> 07:23.860
My husband says he wants to come too.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.656
Is something wrong?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.284
Nothing.

07:33.244 --> 07:38.249
Can we participate as a couple?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.751
You and your husband?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.629
Of course, it's no problem. By all means.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.551
Thank you. Well then, see you.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.635
Wait--

07:55.433 --> 07:57.477
They were definitely having sex.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.569
Husband and wife together, huh?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.365
The marathon camp?

08:11.449 --> 08:13.993
Yeah, tomorrow.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.539
Our marathon club decided to do a camp.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.751
I said I'd bring you along.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.712
What?

08:24.795 --> 08:28.466
It's that course along the lake.
They say it's beautiful.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.760
- And we'll BBQ for dinner--
- Why?

08:31.636 --> 08:32.553
Huh?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.348
I never said I would go.

08:37.391 --> 08:38.392
I'm not going.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.487
Saya, you've locked yourself in here
all this time.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.241
You need some fresh air.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.039
You like running.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.377
You'd enjoy it.
It'll make you feel better.

09:06.963 --> 09:07.797
Right?

09:15.930 --> 09:21.519
I'd like to see you run again.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.941
It doesn't matter if I run.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.241
You don't understand anything.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.871
Saya!

09:41.831 --> 09:44.125
Stop this!

09:50.798 --> 09:55.636
Why are you like this?
What are you dissatisfied with?

09:56.429 --> 10:00.850
I've worked so hard for you!
I bought this condo for you!

10:00.933 --> 10:03.728
I help you with housework
when it becomes too much.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.983
So, why are you like this now?

10:11.319 --> 10:12.320
I don't get it!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
If I've changed…

10:23.414 --> 10:24.624
I've changed…

10:27.668 --> 10:29.795
and so have you.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.114
Saya.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.242
Isn't this great?

11:00.326 --> 11:05.581
I wanted to show this to you,
this world-class view.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.667
Right?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.836
- Yeah.
- Wow, it's too much.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.049
The ceiling is so high!

11:16.342 --> 11:20.012
It'll be tough to fill it with furniture.
We'll need a bigger TV.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.057
What, quit my job?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.976
Yeah. It's tough
for you to work, isn't it?

11:26.060 --> 11:29.980
You're working, then coming home
to cook and do housework.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.567
So you can just quit and be a homemaker.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.194
No, but--

11:35.277 --> 11:39.532
We've bought this condo,
so I'll work and make plenty of money.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.616
Leave it to me.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.328
Souta, it's just, I--

11:44.412 --> 11:46.580
Sorry, I have a meeting
first thing in the morning.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.790
I'll get going.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.834
I'll be coming home late again tonight.

11:53.712 --> 11:54.630
I'm off.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.847
Souta.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.100
What's wrong?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.812
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.939
Okay.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.321
Then you should just head back.
I can run on my own.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.448
What?

12:20.531 --> 12:22.616
All right? Take care.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.838
I can't stand it!

12:39.383 --> 12:40.384
What's wrong?

12:44.096 --> 12:46.307
I can't go home.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.660
Shouldn't you make up with your sister?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.830
It's fine.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.999
She's not the type to take it too hard.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.963
Sakura.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.050
Would you like
to shop for supplies tomorrow?

13:21.842 --> 13:24.303
- What?
- There's a workshop in Kamakura.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.305
On the way back, let's go to the beach.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.601
Okay.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.605
Great. Then it's decided.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.911
Make yourself at home.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.252
Don't worry about it.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.089
This is a great help.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.717
I don't know anybody around here.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.680
What about the other wives in the condo?

14:11.517 --> 14:15.104
I live on the third floor.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.984
I see.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.947
Get some rest.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.828
Thank you so much.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.164
Do you feel better?

15:16.832 --> 15:17.833
Yes.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.419
You're cute when you smile.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.900
My wife is cheating on me.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.907
I'm lonely too.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.747
It's hard when you can't connect
with the person closest to you.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.630
Come over again, anytime.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.259
Mr. Sanada.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.928
Yes?

16:53.804 --> 16:57.891
I'm so sorry about
the phone call yesterday.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.977
No, don't…

17:00.060 --> 17:02.438
You noticed, didn't you, my voice?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.064
No…

17:05.149 --> 17:08.027
The thing is, my husband was suspicious.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.738
Of what?

17:11.321 --> 17:14.742
He thought I might be
having an affair with you.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.453
So he wanted me to call you
in front of him.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.290
And he made me do all of that… Oh, gosh.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.876
Did it clear up the misunderstanding?

17:23.959 --> 17:26.378
Yes, that's why I brought him.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.172
Let's see.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.090
Hello, dear.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.344
I told you,
remember to pull your arms back.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.512
Wait a sec.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.807
- Just how big is this lake?
- Seventeen kilometers.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.142
Are you kidding me?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.020
It's okay.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.440
You can rest along the way,
and we'll take it nice and slow, okay?

17:46.523 --> 17:48.776
- Yeah, nice and slow.
- Okay, so your arms…

17:48.859 --> 17:51.320
Does anyone not have a drink? All good?

17:52.154 --> 17:54.782
Okay, everyone, nice run today! Cheers!

17:54.865 --> 17:57.284
Cheers! Good run!

17:57.826 --> 17:59.119
Good run!

17:59.203 --> 18:01.497
Okay, the meat is ready.

CALLING…

19:53.025 --> 19:54.067
Here it is.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.695
There are so many.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.368
They're so cute.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.126
Was that goldfish made here?

20:11.210 --> 20:14.004
Yes. We've been relying on them
since my granddad's day.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.215
For the fishbowls, too?

20:16.298 --> 20:19.551
I don't make
those cramped and stuffy things.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.220
Stuffy?

20:21.803 --> 20:23.388
Yeah, for the goldfish.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.599
Right.

20:26.141 --> 20:30.229
That's why Haru jumped
out of his fishbowl.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.151
No need for that. It's old news.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.029
Nah, I was glad you did.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.200
That you got that shop going again.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.677
This feels wonderful!

21:01.760 --> 21:03.303
This is my secret spot.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.554
You come here often?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.267
No. I came here once when I was kid.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.977
With your parents?

21:14.398 --> 21:16.984
Would you tell me about it?

21:17.943 --> 21:22.406
I want to know more about you.

21:33.834 --> 21:38.338
I came here with my mother and father.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.550
It was when
my granddad still ran the shop.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.888
At the time, there happened to be
a fireworks display.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.308
- Fireworks?
- Yes.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.270
They happen nearby in the summer.
The view from here is amazing.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.814
Boom! Across the sky and the sea.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.441
Wow.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.384
My father was a workaholic.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.597
This is the only fun memory I have of him.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.439
My father runs a company.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.026
I was raised strictly

22:41.109 --> 22:43.320
under expectations
to take over the business.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.741
I tried my absolute best…

22:51.578 --> 22:54.164
but in the end, I couldn't meet
my father's expectations.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.754
I don't thrive on living competitively

23:01.963 --> 23:04.216
and always striving for higher results.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.386
I'd rather live in a quiet place

23:09.304 --> 23:11.973
and spend my time
caring for other creatures.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.391
That's more my pace.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.814
My father was incredibly angry.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.692
But, well, my sister is there.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.907
She has the skills
and the disposition for it.

23:29.866 --> 23:34.079
She's far more suited
to take over than I was.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.917
Well, that's about all I can tell you.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.962
It's not very interesting, is it?

23:45.507 --> 23:46.925
That's not true.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.098
Thank you…

23:55.517 --> 23:56.726
for telling me.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.992
I'm sorry for all the commotion.

24:12.075 --> 24:12.951
Not at all.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.623
My husband is an alcoholic.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.170
And he doesn't seem to fit in well
within his new department.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.964
He drinks to escape.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.301
Alcohol, huh?

24:31.386 --> 24:36.016
I thought if he ran,
he might feel a little better.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.561
I didn't think this would happen.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.273
I did him wrong.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.487
He seemed to be enjoying it.

24:51.072 --> 24:51.990
Pardon?

24:52.073 --> 24:56.995
Your husband,
he seemed to enjoy running with you.

25:02.626 --> 25:08.882
It's encouraging to have someone
to run alongside you.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.718
Run alongside?

25:13.136 --> 25:16.139
I started to run
because my wife invited me.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.894
At first, I couldn't
keep up with her at all.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.773
It was hard and frustrating.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.152
But before I knew it, I was sucked in.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.489
Enough to start my own running club.

25:38.870 --> 25:39.996
Where's your wife?

25:42.999 --> 25:46.461
She doesn't seem to want to run anymore.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.882
Even though she used to love it so much.

25:55.512 --> 25:59.432
I have no idea what she's thinking.

26:04.145 --> 26:08.900
Why don't you run alongside her?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.028
What?

26:13.321 --> 26:19.327
Maybe it's your turn to run alongside
your wife and encourage her.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.330
At your wife's pace.

26:23.665 --> 26:30.297
Maybe then, you'll see the scenery
that you've been missing.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.361
What are you dissatisfied with?

26:54.112 --> 26:58.283
I've worked so hard for you!
I bought this condo for you!

27:00.827 --> 27:05.123
It's hard when you can't connect
with the person closest to you.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.673
Aren't you getting on?

27:25.060 --> 27:28.938
There really is such a thing as feng shui.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.482
Pardon?

27:32.150 --> 27:36.446
Since we came here, nothing's gone right.

27:37.655 --> 27:41.451
But you can change your luck.
That's what feng shui is for.

27:43.161 --> 27:47.165
The worst thing to do is to stop running
and just stand still.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.293
You need to bring in new wind.

27:59.010 --> 28:03.515
You should try running.
It doesn't matter where.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.080
MISSED CALL

28:31.042 --> 28:32.293
Why don't you…

28:34.629 --> 28:36.423
run alongside her?

28:40.844 --> 28:43.555
So, why are you like this now?

28:44.180 --> 28:47.392
I've changed and so have you.

28:50.854 --> 28:56.901
Maybe then, you'll see the scenery
you've been missing.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.617
Why don't you answer it?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.961
SOUTA

30:50.473 --> 30:51.474
Hello.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.226
Saya.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.563
What?

30:57.897 --> 30:58.815
I'm sorry.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.109
I'm so sorry.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.026
For what?

31:03.736 --> 31:05.488
What are you sorry for?

31:06.489 --> 31:09.075
Don't apologize if you don't know why.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.207
Souta?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.169
Are you running?

31:21.629 --> 31:22.505
Yeah.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.218
I'm coming home.
I'll arrive in the early morning.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.470
Let's talk.

31:30.388 --> 31:33.558
Huh? You plan on running
all the way to Tokyo?

31:33.641 --> 31:35.268
I needed to clear my head.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.229
It's really not so far away.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.398
It's the same course
as the ultra-marathon.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.401
I can't believe it. Are you stupid?

31:45.403 --> 31:46.529
I was stupid.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.116
I was just so stupid.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.289
Saya.

31:57.123 --> 32:00.460
I think I was going a little too fast.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.094
I'm sorry.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.263
Let's run together.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.225
You are…

32:24.901 --> 32:26.152
Damn it.

32:26.736 --> 32:27.654
Souta?

32:28.738 --> 32:29.739
Souta?

32:35.995 --> 32:37.246
Just leave him be.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.373
I'm sorry.

33:26.045 --> 33:29.465
I think I was going a little too fast.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.568
Saya.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.074
I…

34:37.366 --> 34:38.284
I…

34:39.535 --> 34:40.536
Honestly…

34:46.501 --> 34:47.543
Honestly…

34:50.421 --> 34:53.382
I don't need to live in a tower condo.

34:54.967 --> 34:55.802
Yeah.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.304
And money…

35:00.098 --> 35:02.141
I don't need a lot of it.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.062
Okay.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.859
I… I just…

35:14.278 --> 35:17.281
I just wanted to be with you more.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.833
Even the marathon,

35:28.209 --> 35:29.544
I wanted…

35:31.379 --> 35:33.297
I wanted to run it with you.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.218
And so…

35:42.140 --> 35:43.641
it was hard to say anything.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.604
Because you said it was all for me.

35:50.731 --> 35:54.318
So I didn't say anything.

35:56.946 --> 36:00.908
But I should have said something.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.037
I should've spoken up.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.502
So…

36:15.715 --> 36:16.716
I'm…

36:19.385 --> 36:20.553
sorry, too.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.146
I'm sorry.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.608
It's okay.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.443
I'm sorry too.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.798
Here you are.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.633
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:46.639 --> 37:50.059
I had fun today at the beach.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.019
Yeah.

37:53.271 --> 37:57.483
We should go again in the summer,
to see the fireworks.

38:00.903 --> 38:01.904
Yes, let's go.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.243
It's a promise.

38:28.931 --> 38:33.519
KAZAMA

38:36.564 --> 38:38.441
My father will be down shortly.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.418
My apologies for the wait.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.008
It is a pleasure to meet you.
