04:16.546 --> 04:17.939
Well!

04:35.774 --> 04:39.628
I didn't think the Mingotts
would have tried it on.

04:39.861 --> 04:42.005
Parading her at the
opera like that.

04:42.113 --> 04:45.717
Sitting her next to May
Welland. It's all very odd.

04:45.825 --> 04:48.470
Well, she's had such an odd life.

04:48.578 --> 04:51.181
Will they bring her to
the Beauforts' ball?

04:51.289 --> 04:54.517
If they do, the talk
will be of little else.

05:15.605 --> 05:18.333
Good evening, Mrs. Welland.
Good evening, May.

05:18.441 --> 05:19.793
Newland.

05:20.026 --> 05:22.796
You know my niece,
Countess Olenska.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.392
Countess.

05:45.385 --> 05:47.904
I hope you've told Madame Olenska.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.114
What?

05:49.222 --> 05:50.699
That we're engaged.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.035
I want everybody to know.

05:54.352 --> 05:56.955
Let me announce this
evening it at the ball.

05:57.189 --> 05:59.282
If you can persuade Mama.

05:59.983 --> 06:03.003
Why should we change
what is already settled?

06:03.361 --> 06:07.090
But you can tell my cousin
yourself. She remembers you.

06:08.241 --> 06:13.346
I remember we played together.
How this brings it all back to me.

06:14.998 --> 06:18.893
I remember everybody in
knickerbockers and pantalettes.

06:32.307 --> 06:33.575
You were horrid.

06:33.850 --> 06:36.536
You kissed me once behind a door.

06:36.645 --> 06:40.415
But it was Vandy, who never
looked at me, that I loved.

06:45.070 --> 06:49.132
- You have been away a very long time.
- Centuries and centuries.

06:49.199 --> 06:53.011
So long, I'm sure I'm dead and
this dear place is heaven.

07:40.083 --> 07:44.145
It invariably happened, as
everything did in those days...

07:44.337 --> 07:45.855
in the same way.

07:45.964 --> 07:47.148
As usual...

07:47.257 --> 07:51.486
Mrs. Julius Beaufort appeared,
unaccompanied by her husband...

07:51.595 --> 07:53.863
just before "The Jewel Song."

07:53.972 --> 07:58.076
And, again as usual, rose at
the end of the third act...

07:58.185 --> 07:59.869
and disappeared.

07:59.978 --> 08:03.415
New York then knew that
a half-hour later...

08:03.523 --> 08:07.794
the Beauforts' annual
opera ball would begin.

08:22.584 --> 08:26.646
Carriages waited at the curb
for the entire performance.

08:26.755 --> 08:30.191
It was known in New York
but never acknowledged...

08:30.300 --> 08:33.153
that Americans want
to leave amusement...

08:33.260 --> 08:36.114
even more quickly than
they want to get to it.

08:48.068 --> 08:53.298
The Beauforts' house was one of the
few in New York with a ballroom.

08:53.406 --> 08:58.595
Such a room, shuttered in
darkness 364 days of the year...

08:58.703 --> 09:04.059
was felt to compensate for whatever
was regrettable in the Beaufort past.

09:04.167 --> 09:07.812
Regina Beaufort came from an
old South Carolina family.

09:07.921 --> 09:11.691
But her husband, Julius, who
passed for an Englishman...

09:11.800 --> 09:15.570
was known to have dissipated
habits, a bitter tongue...

09:15.679 --> 09:18.156
and mysterious antecedents.

09:18.390 --> 09:21.284
His marriage assured him
a social position...

09:21.393 --> 09:24.162
but not necessarily respect.

10:01.224 --> 10:05.745
Newland Archer hadn't stopped at his
club, as young men usually did...

10:05.896 --> 10:08.039
but came directly to the ball.

10:08.148 --> 10:10.959
He wanted the announcement
of his engagement...

10:11.067 --> 10:13.670
to divert gossip away
from the countess...

10:13.737 --> 10:18.800
and show his most ardent support
for May and her whole family.

10:24.998 --> 10:28.518
The Beaufort house had
been boldly planned.

10:28.627 --> 10:32.689
Instead of squeezing through a
passage to get to the ballroom...

10:32.756 --> 10:38.194
one marched solemnly down a vista
of enfiladed drawing rooms.

10:52.776 --> 10:56.671
But only by passing through
the crimson drawing room...

10:56.780 --> 10:59.758
could one see The
Return of Spring...

10:59.866 --> 11:02.844
the much-discussed
nude by Bouguereau...

11:02.953 --> 11:08.058
which Beaufort had had the
audacity to hang in plain sight.

11:15.382 --> 11:18.652
Archer enjoyed such
challenges to convention.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.446
He questioned conformity
in private...

11:21.555 --> 11:24.741
but in public he upheld
family and tradition.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.203
This was a world balanced
so precariously...

11:28.311 --> 11:31.665
that its harmony could be
shattered by a whisper.

11:53.003 --> 11:57.941
On the whole, Archer was amused by
the smooth hypocrisies of his peers.

11:58.049 --> 12:00.610
He may even have envied them.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.904
Lawrence Lefferts, for instance...

12:03.013 --> 12:06.408
was New York's foremost
authority on form.

12:06.516 --> 12:09.911
His opinion on pumps versus
patent-leather oxfords...

12:10.020 --> 12:12.247
had never been disputed.

12:12.355 --> 12:14.916
On matters of
surreptitious romance...

12:15.192 --> 12:18.545
his skills went unquestioned.

12:36.213 --> 12:40.942
Old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was as
great an authority on family...

12:41.051 --> 12:43.695
as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.

12:43.887 --> 12:48.867
The mean and melancholy history of
Countess Olenska's European marriage...

12:48.975 --> 12:52.704
was a buried treasure he
hastened to excavate.

12:52.896 --> 12:54.956
He carried, like a calling card...

12:55.106 --> 12:58.501
an entire register of the
scandals and mysteries...

12:58.610 --> 13:02.672
that had smoldered under the
unruffled surface of society...

13:02.781 --> 13:05.550
for the last 50 years.

13:11.748 --> 13:16.645
Now, Julius Beaufort's secret was
the way he carried things off.

13:17.254 --> 13:21.483
He could arrive casually at his party
as if he were another guest...

13:21.591 --> 13:22.984
and might leave early...

13:23.093 --> 13:27.864
for a more modest but comforting
address in the East 30s.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.283
He was intrepid in his business...

13:30.392 --> 13:34.871
but in his personal affairs,
absolutely audacious.

13:38.024 --> 13:43.213
Archer's fiancÃ©e was innocent of all
these intrigues and of much else.

13:43.321 --> 13:48.385
May Welland represented for Archer
all that was best in their world...

13:48.493 --> 13:52.847
all that he honored. And
she anchored him to it.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.063
I've told my friends,
just as you asked.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.398
I couldn't wait.

14:01.506 --> 14:05.360
- I wish it hadn't been at a ball.
- But even here we're alone.

14:05.468 --> 14:10.657
The worst of it is that I
want to kiss you and I can't.

14:22.569 --> 14:25.046
Did you tell Ellen
as I asked you to?

14:25.864 --> 14:28.216
I didn't have a chance after all.

14:28.658 --> 14:32.095
She's my cousin. If others
know before she does...

14:32.245 --> 14:35.473
She's been away for so long.
She's rather sensitive.

14:35.582 --> 14:38.435
I'll tell her. But I
didn't see her yet.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.023
- She didn't come at the last minute.
- At the last minute?

14:43.548 --> 14:46.151
She thought her dress
wasn't smart enough.

14:46.259 --> 14:50.071
We thought it was lovely, but
she asked to be taken home.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.532
Oh, well.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.093
Very handsome.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.845
Very liberal.

15:13.954 --> 15:18.308
In my time, a cameo set in pearls
was thought to be sufficient.

15:18.416 --> 15:22.437
But it's the hand that sets
off the ring, isn't it?

15:22.546 --> 15:25.148
The setting shows the
stone beautifully.

15:25.715 --> 15:28.443
But it looks bare to
old-fashioned eyes.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.989
I hope you don't mean mine,
my dear. I like all the novelties.

15:33.139 --> 15:37.953
My hands were modeled in Paris by the
great Rochet. He should do May's.

15:38.061 --> 15:39.496
Show me, child.

15:40.355 --> 15:42.999
Her hand is so tempered.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.127
These modern sports
spread the joints.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.629
But the skin is white.

15:47.737 --> 15:49.339
When's the wedding?

15:50.240 --> 15:53.218
Soon, if only you'll back
me up, Mrs. Mingott.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.098
We must give them time to
know each other better.

15:58.206 --> 15:59.266
Know each other?

15:59.416 --> 16:02.185
Everyone in New York has
always known everyone.

16:02.294 --> 16:06.189
Don't wait till the bubble's off
the wine. Marry before Lent.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.318
I may catch pneumonia, and I want
to give the wedding breakfast.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.778
What a kind offer.

16:11.928 --> 16:14.322
Even if she hadn't been
May's grandmother...

16:14.431 --> 16:18.159
Mrs. Manson Mingott would have
been the first to receive...

16:18.268 --> 16:20.954
the required betrothal visit.

16:21.062 --> 16:23.832
She was not only the
matriarch of this world...

16:23.940 --> 16:26.501
she was nearly its dowager empress.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.004
Much of New York was
related to her...

16:29.112 --> 16:33.091
and she knew the remainder by
marriage or by reputation.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.176
Though brownstone was the norm...

16:35.285 --> 16:38.513
she lived magisterially
within a large house...

16:38.622 --> 16:42.559
of controversial pale,
cream-colored stone...

16:42.709 --> 16:46.813
in an inaccessible wilderness
near the Central Park.

16:47.631 --> 16:51.109
The burden of her flesh had long
since made it impossible...

16:51.218 --> 16:53.320
for her to climb stairs.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.072
So with characteristic
independence...

16:56.139 --> 17:00.327
she had established herself on
the ground floor of her house.

17:00.477 --> 17:05.248
From her sitting room, there was an
unexpected vista of her bedroom.

17:05.732 --> 17:10.337
Her visitors were fascinated by the
foreignness of this arrangement...

17:10.444 --> 17:13.798
which recalled scenes
in French fiction.

17:14.491 --> 17:19.137
This was how women with lovers
lived in the wicked old societies.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.598
But if she had wanted a lover...

17:21.705 --> 17:24.768
the intrepid woman would
have had him too.

17:25.585 --> 17:27.896
For now, she was content simply...

17:28.003 --> 17:32.150
for life and passion to flow
northward to her door...

17:32.259 --> 17:36.237
and to anticipate eagerly the
union of Newland Archer...

17:36.346 --> 17:38.448
with her granddaughter, May.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.242
In them, two of New
York's best families...

17:41.351 --> 17:44.245
would finally and
momentously be joined.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.748
- Goodbye, Mama.
- Goodbye.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.083
Ellen.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.797
Beaufort, this is a rare favor.

17:55.031 --> 17:57.217
Unnecessarily rare, I'd say.

17:57.742 --> 18:01.388
I met Countess Ellen, and she
let me walk home with her.

18:01.496 --> 18:04.266
This house will be merrier
now that she's here.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.102
- Thank you.
- Beaufort, pull up that tuffet.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.645
I want a good gossip.

18:08.753 --> 18:11.147
You already know about May and me.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.817
She scolded me for not telling you.

18:13.925 --> 18:16.403
Of course I know, and I'm so glad.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.447
One doesn't tell such
news first in a crowd.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.866
Careful there.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.494
Don't catch your
ring on your sleeve.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.996
Goodbye.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.332
Goodbye.

18:31.234 --> 18:32.836
Come and see me someday.

18:36.072 --> 18:40.135
It's a mistake for Ellen to parade
up 5th Avenue with Julius...

18:40.243 --> 18:41.845
at the crowded hour...

18:42.537 --> 18:45.056
the very day after her arrival.

18:45.165 --> 18:49.060
He's so flagrant. Even his wife
must know about Annie Ring.

19:00.263 --> 19:04.284
Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his
frequent visits to the Archer home...

19:04.434 --> 19:06.661
more than the actual dining.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.747
Newland Archer's mother...

19:08.855 --> 19:13.251
and his sister Janey were both shy
women and shrank from society.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.839
But they liked to be well-informed
and doted on their bachelor friend.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.508
Certain nuances escape Beaufort.

19:20.617 --> 19:24.554
Necessarily. Beaufort
is a vulgar man.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.600
Not in business. Most of New York
trusts him with its affairs.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.519
My Grandfather Newland
always told Mother:

19:31.628 --> 19:35.690
"Don't let that Beaufort be
introduced to the girls."

19:36.842 --> 19:40.528
At least he's had the advantage
of association with gentlemen.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.865
The Archers and the Mingotts
were the sturdiest branches...

19:43.974 --> 19:46.826
of New York's tangled family tree.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.830
Granny Mingott's family could
embrace May's traditionalism...

19:50.939 --> 19:54.000
and tolerate Ellen's
unconventionality.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.879
But Archer's family held
fast to the old ways.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.841
His mother and sister relied
on him for every security.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.345
He would always be, Mrs.
Archer assured May's mother:

20:05.453 --> 20:08.515
"Their strong right hand."

20:08.665 --> 20:10.642
Was our new cousin at the ball?

20:10.750 --> 20:15.063
I appreciate the Mingotts' support
of her, having her at the opera.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.607
I admire their esprit de corps.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.318
But why my son's engagement...

20:20.427 --> 20:24.656
should be mixed up with her
comings and goings, I don't see.

20:24.764 --> 20:27.242
In any case, she was
not at the ball.

20:27.350 --> 20:30.120
At least she had that decency.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.168
Does she wear a round hat or
a bonnet in the afternoon?

20:37.277 --> 20:40.255
The dress she wore to
the opera was so plain.

20:40.363 --> 20:43.258
- It was in better taste not to go.
- It wasn't taste.

20:43.366 --> 20:46.344
May said Ellen decided her
dress wasn't smart enough.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.971
Poor Ellen.

20:48.288 --> 20:51.683
We must always remember the
eccentric bringing-up she had.

20:51.791 --> 20:56.521
What can you expect of a girl who wore
black satin at her coming-out ball?

20:57.214 --> 21:01.401
It's odd she kept such an ugly name
as Ellen when she married the count.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.361
I'd have changed it to Elaine.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.405
Why?

21:06.473 --> 21:08.074
I don't know.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.868
It sounds more...

21:09.976 --> 21:11.411
Polish.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.875
It sounds more conspicuous. That
can hardly be what she wishes.

21:16.983 --> 21:20.295
Why shouldn't she be
conspicuous if she chooses?

21:20.403 --> 21:23.632
She made an awful marriage,
but should she hide her head?

21:23.740 --> 21:26.843
Should she slink around as
if she disgraced herself?

21:27.869 --> 21:31.056
She's had a sad life. That
doesn't make her an outcast.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.268
I'm sure that's the line
the Mingotts mean to take.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.814
I needn't wait for their cue,
if that's what you mean.

21:40.340 --> 21:45.153
I'm told she's looking for a house.
She intends to live here.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.364
I hear she means to get a divorce.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.992
I hope she will.

21:53.436 --> 21:57.165
Understandably, her
marriage was intolerable.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.961
- There are the rumors too.
- I've heard them.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.337
The secretary.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.759
He helped get her away
from the husband.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.348
They say the count kept her
practically a prisoner.

22:13.456 --> 22:16.726
Certainly the count had
his own way of life.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.357
- You knew him?
- I heard of him at Nice.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.193
Handsome, they say...

22:26.178 --> 22:28.655
but eyes with a lot of lashes.

22:29.472 --> 22:31.950
When he wasn't with women...

22:32.684 --> 22:34.703
he was collecting china.

22:35.353 --> 22:38.415
Paying any price for
both, I understand.

22:38.481 --> 22:39.958
Then where's the blame?

22:40.066 --> 22:44.838
Any one of us would have helped the
countess, just as the secretary did.

22:45.488 --> 22:47.882
He was still helping
her a year later.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.969
Somebody met them living
together at Lausanne.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.264
Living together?

22:55.582 --> 22:58.852
Why not? She has the right
to make her life over.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.606
Why bury a woman alive if
her husband prefers whores?

23:02.714 --> 23:05.233
It's hardly a question
of entombment.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.444
The countess is here, after all.

23:09.346 --> 23:13.950
Or do you believe a woman should
share the same freedoms as men?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.704
I suppose I do. Yes, I do.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.541
Apparently Count Olenski takes
a similarly modern view.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.337
I never heard of him lifting a
finger to get his wife back.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.635
Three days later, the
unthinkable happened.

23:32.118 --> 23:34.763
Mrs. Manson Mingott
sent out invitations...

23:35.205 --> 23:38.141
summoning everyone
to a formal dinner.

23:38.458 --> 23:41.978
Such an occasion demanded the
most careful consideration.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.940
It required the appropriate plate.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.275
It called for three
extra footmen...

23:47.384 --> 23:51.780
two dishes for each course and
a Roman punch in the middle.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.159
The dinner, read the invitation...

23:56.268 --> 23:59.621
was "to meet the Countess Olenska."

24:03.233 --> 24:05.961
And New York declined.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.632
"Regret, unable to accept."

24:10.740 --> 24:12.550
And from our own family.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.928
No one cares enough...

24:15.036 --> 24:19.140
to conceal their feelings about
the countess. This is a disgrace.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.477
They all lived in a kind
of hieroglyphic world.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.398
The real thing was never said
or done or even thought...

24:26.506 --> 24:30.777
but only represented by a
set of arbitrary signs.

24:31.595 --> 24:36.825
Archer knew these signs. They were
not subtle and were not meant to be.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.577
They were more than
a simple snubbing.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.497
They were an eradication.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.709
There was a single court of appeal.

24:45.817 --> 24:49.546
He would plead their case
before the van der Luydens.

24:49.654 --> 24:54.884
And all this, you think, is due to
some intentional interference by...

24:55.118 --> 24:57.220
Larry Lefferts. I'm certain of it.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.932
The van der Luydens dwelled
above all the cities' families...

25:01.041 --> 25:04.603
in a kind of
superterrestrial twilight.

25:04.711 --> 25:09.566
Archer appealed to their exquisitely
refined sense of tribal order.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.151
And he spoke plainly.

25:11.259 --> 25:16.072
Whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins
to suspect her husband of something...

25:16.181 --> 25:20.410
Larry makes some great diversionary
fuss to show how moral he is.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.372
It's the principle that I dislike.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.878
I mean, if a member of a well-known
family is backed by that family...

25:30.362 --> 25:32.380
it should be considered final.

25:32.489 --> 25:37.469
We felt this slight on the countess
shouldn't pass without consulting you.

25:38.119 --> 25:42.182
We're giving a dinner for our
cousin, the Duke of St. Austrey...

25:42.332 --> 25:44.935
who arrives next
week on the Russia.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.063
I'm sure Louisa will
be as glad as I am...

25:48.171 --> 25:52.901
if Countess Olenska will let us
include her among our guests.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.033
The occasion was a solemn one.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.661
But the countess
arrived rather late...

26:02.811 --> 26:07.832
signaling a carelessness of
which she was entirely unaware.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.669
She entered, without haste
or embarrassment...

26:10.777 --> 26:14.255
the drawing room in which New
York's most chosen company...

26:14.364 --> 26:18.260
was somewhat awfully assembled.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.178
Countess Olenska.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.556
Good evening.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.017
We're delighted you're here.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.312
The Duke of St. Austrey. May
I present Countess Olenska.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.148
The Trevenna George
II plate was out.

26:32.507 --> 26:36.569
So was the van der Luyden Lowestoft
from the East India Company...

26:36.678 --> 26:39.155
and the Dagonet Crown Derby.

26:39.347 --> 26:42.909
Dining with the van der Luydens
was, at best, no light matter.

26:43.226 --> 26:46.329
Dining there with a duke
who was their cousin...

26:46.563 --> 26:49.457
was almost a religious solemnity.

26:49.900 --> 26:54.337
When the van der Luyden's chose,
they knew how to give a lesson.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.503
Excuse me.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.927
It was not the custom
in New York...

27:42.035 --> 27:45.221
for a lady to get up and walk
away from one gentleman...

27:45.330 --> 27:48.558
in order to seek the
company of another.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.646
But the countess did
not observe this rule.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.694
I want you to talk to me about May.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.531
You knew the duke before?

28:03.723 --> 28:05.158
From Nice.

28:05.308 --> 28:10.622
We saw him every winter. He's fond of
gambling and came to our house often.

28:11.398 --> 28:16.044
He wears the same suit every evening.
He thinks it brings him luck.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.089
He's the dullest man I ever met.

28:20.323 --> 28:23.593
But he seems to be admired here.

28:24.828 --> 28:28.598
May I tell you what most
interests me about New York?

28:28.707 --> 28:32.727
Not all the blind obeying of
somebody else's tradition.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.481
It seems stupid to make America
a copy of another country.

28:36.590 --> 28:41.319
Would Columbus have taken such trouble
just to go to the opera with Lefferts?

28:46.808 --> 28:51.871
If he'd known Larry Lefferts were
here, he might never have left port.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.418
And May? Does she
share these views?

28:56.526 --> 28:58.753
If she does, she'd never say so.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.007
Are you very much in love with her?

29:02.449 --> 29:04.301
As much as a man can be.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.344
Do you think there's a limit?

29:09.873 --> 29:11.850
If there is, I haven't found it.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.731
It's really and truly
a romance then.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.400
Not in the least arranged?

29:20.884 --> 29:24.779
In our country, we don't allow
our marriages to be arranged.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.159
Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.078
I sometimes make these mistakes.

29:32.562 --> 29:37.000
I don't always remember that
everything here is good...

29:37.234 --> 29:39.502
that was bad where I came from.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.716
I'm so sorry.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.807
But you know you are
among friends here.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.019
Yes, I know. That's
why I came home.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.195
You'll want to be with May.

30:07.347 --> 30:11.159
She's already surrounded
by so many rivals.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.704
Then stay with me a little longer.

30:16.439 --> 30:17.791
Yes.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.836
Mr. Urban Dagonet,
the Countess Olenska.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.673
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do?

30:24.781 --> 30:27.676
Tomorrow then, after
5, I'll expect you.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.512
Tomorrow.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.180
Excuse me.

30:40.463 --> 30:43.191
It was good of you to
devote yourself...

30:43.300 --> 30:46.861
to Madame Olenska so
unselfishly, dear Newland.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.073
I told Henry he really
must rescue you.

30:50.724 --> 30:54.160
I think I've never seen
May looking lovelier.

30:54.603 --> 30:59.124
The duke thinks her the
handsomest woman in the room.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.776
Mr. Archer.

32:08.885 --> 32:12.614
So how do you like
this odd little house?

32:12.806 --> 32:14.699
To me, it's like heaven.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.410
You've arranged it delightfully.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.622
Some of the things I
managed to bring with me.

32:20.730 --> 32:24.125
Little pieces of wreckage.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.879
At least it's less gloomy
than the van der Luydens'...

32:27.988 --> 32:30.340
and not so difficult to be alone.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.469
I'm sure it's often thought the
van der Luydens' is gloomy...

32:34.578 --> 32:36.721
though I've never
heard it said before.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.057
Do you really like to be alone?

32:39.457 --> 32:42.811
As long as my friends keep
me from being lonely.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.066
I see you've already
chosen your corner.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.986
- Please, sit.
- Thank you.

32:55.432 --> 32:58.076
This is the hour I like best.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.869
Don't you?

33:00.020 --> 33:02.289
I was afraid you'd
forgotten the hour.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.417
I'm sure Beaufort can
be very intriguing.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.838
He took me to see some houses.

33:10.322 --> 33:15.343
I'm told I must move, even though this
street seems perfectly respectable.

33:15.452 --> 33:18.263
- Yes, but it's not fashionable.
- Fashionable?

33:18.371 --> 33:20.807
Is fashion such a
serious consideration?

33:20.916 --> 33:24.394
Among people with nothing
more serious to consider.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.400
Perhaps I've been too independent.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.905
All I really want is to
feel cared for and safe.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.621
The van der Luydens
do nothing by halves.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.707
All New York laid itself
out for you last night.

33:45.815 --> 33:48.418
It was so kind. Such a nice party.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.087
Cream or lemon?

33:53.240 --> 33:54.341
Lemon, please.

33:54.449 --> 33:58.511
The van der Luydens are the most
powerful influence in society.

33:58.662 --> 34:02.223
They very seldom receive because
of Cousin Louisa's health.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.977
- Perhaps that's the reason then.
- Thank you. The reason?

34:06.086 --> 34:09.356
For their influence. They
make themselves so rare.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.275
But of course you must tell me.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.612
No, it's you telling me.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.868
Then we can both help each other.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.038
But I need help so much more.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.415
There are so many people already...

34:28.692 --> 34:30.210
to tell you what to do.

34:32.946 --> 34:37.759
I think they're all a little angry
with me for setting up for myself.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.763
Still, your family can advise
you, show you the way.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.139
Is New York such a labyrinth?

34:44.248 --> 34:48.103
I thought it was all straight
up and down, like 5th Avenue.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.272
All the cross streets numbered...

34:50.755 --> 34:53.275
and big honest labels
on everything.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.068
Everything is labeled...

34:55.217 --> 34:56.902
but everybody is not.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.659
I must count on you
for warnings too.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.371
All the older women like you.
They want to help.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.624
I know. As long as they don't
hear anything unpleasant.

35:10.901 --> 35:15.630
Does no one here want to
know the truth, Mr. Archer?

35:15.739 --> 35:19.551
The real loneliness is living
among all these kind people...

35:19.659 --> 35:21.886
who only ask you to pretend.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.809
No, you mustn't.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.271
Madame Olenska.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.942
Ellen...

35:39.054 --> 35:40.864
Does no one cry here, either?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.575
I suppose there's no need to.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.344
Oh, Mr. Archer, good evening.

36:02.452 --> 36:06.848
We didn't see you and weren't sure
whether to send Miss Welland...

36:06.957 --> 36:10.060
Lilies of the valley. Let's
make it a standing order.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.645
Very good, sir.

36:15.632 --> 36:20.153
And those yellow roses.
I'll give you another address.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.321
Very good.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.956
Mr. Archer. Two separate orders.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.879
- They'll go at once?
- At once.

36:57.007 --> 37:00.110
It's wonderful to wake
with lilies of the valley.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.736
It's like being with you.

37:01.845 --> 37:05.282
They came late yesterday, I know.
Time got away from me.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.409
But still, you always remember.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.662
I sent roses to Ellen too.
Was that right?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.122
Very right.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.000
She didn't mention it
at lunch today, though.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.211
She got some wonderful
orchids from Mr. Beaufort...

37:18.361 --> 37:21.631
and a hamper of carnations
from Henry van der Luyden.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.261
She was so very delighted. Don't
people send flowers in Europe?

37:27.537 --> 37:30.599
- I know you consider it a long time.
- Very long.

37:30.707 --> 37:35.437
But the Chivers were engaged for a
year and a half, the Lefferts for two.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.939
Mama expects something customary.

37:38.048 --> 37:41.568
Since you were little, you've had
your way. You're almost 22.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.029
Just tell your mother
what you want.

37:44.137 --> 37:47.407
I can't refuse her the last
thing she'd ask of me.

37:47.516 --> 37:50.118
Can't we just strike
out for ourselves?

37:51.561 --> 37:53.455
Shall we elope?

37:53.855 --> 37:56.082
If you would, why not?

37:57.067 --> 38:00.253
You do love me, Newland.
I'm so happy.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.297
Well, why not be happier?

38:02.405 --> 38:04.966
I couldn't be happier, dearest.

38:05.075 --> 38:09.679
I showed Ellen the ring. She thought
it was the most beautiful setting.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.141
She said there was nothing
like it in the Rue de la Paix.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.978
I do love you, Newland.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.940
Everything you do is so special.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.195
I want to call on your legal skills
for a rather delicate matter.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.365
Countess Olenska wants
to divorce her husband.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.284
It's been suggested she
means to marry again...

38:31.393 --> 38:32.953
although she denies it.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.956
I beg your pardon, but
because of my engagement...

38:36.064 --> 38:39.459
perhaps another member of the
firm could consider this.

38:39.568 --> 38:42.462
Precisely because of your
prospective alliance...

38:42.571 --> 38:45.799
and considering members of
the family asked for you...

38:45.907 --> 38:47.384
I'd like you to consider it.

38:47.492 --> 38:51.763
It's a family matter. Perhaps
it's best settled by the family.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.431
Their position is clear.

38:53.540 --> 38:57.727
They're entirely and
rightly against a divorce.

38:57.836 --> 39:01.940
But Countess Olenska still
insists on a legal opinion.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.901
But, really, what's
the use of a divorce?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.528
She's here.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.821
He's there.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.073
The whole Atlantic's between them.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.494
As things go, Olenski's
acted generously.

39:14.603 --> 39:18.206
He's returned some of the
money without being asked.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.625
She'll never get a
dollar more than that.

39:20.942 --> 39:24.963
Although I understand she attaches
no importance to the money.

39:25.489 --> 39:29.926
Considering all that, the wisest
thing is to do as the family say.

39:31.661 --> 39:34.014
Just let well enough alone.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.894
I think that's for her to decide.

39:45.550 --> 39:50.363
Have you considered the consequences
if the countess decides for divorce?

39:50.472 --> 39:53.199
- Consequences for the countess?
- For everyone.

39:53.308 --> 39:57.954
I don't think the count's accusations
are anything more than vague charges.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.914
It will make for some talk.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.376
I've heard talk about the
countess and the secretary...

40:03.485 --> 40:05.837
even before I read
the legal papers.

40:05.946 --> 40:07.797
It's certain to be unpleasant.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.883
Unpleasant?

40:10.534 --> 40:13.929
Divorce is always unpleasant,
don't you agree?

40:16.122 --> 40:17.223
Naturally.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.808
Then I can count on you?

40:18.917 --> 40:23.355
The family can count on you to use
your influence against a divorce?

40:23.922 --> 40:27.734
I can't promise that. Not until
I've talked to the countess.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.695
I don't understand you.

40:31.555 --> 40:35.075
You want to marry into a family
with a divorce hanging over it?

40:35.725 --> 40:39.871
I don't think that has
anything to do with the case.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.041
Can someone take this
to the countess?

40:52.492 --> 40:55.303
You refuse such an invitation
on threat of death.

40:55.412 --> 40:56.596
Is it so bad?

40:56.746 --> 40:59.140
Not if you have a
taste for slow agony.

40:59.207 --> 41:03.311
- I've neglected to cultivate that.
- Three days with the van der Luydens!

41:03.420 --> 41:06.856
- Take your fur and a hot-water bottle.
- Is the house that cold?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.484
- No, but Louisa is.
- Mr. Archer.

41:09.593 --> 41:14.572
Come to Delmonico's on Sunday. I'm
having an oyster supper in your honor.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.410
Private room, congenial
company, artists and so on.

41:18.518 --> 41:22.038
That's tempting. I haven't met a
single artist since my arrival.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.125
I know some painters I
could bring to see you.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.753
Painters? Are there any
painters in New York?

41:28.862 --> 41:33.758
Thank you, but I was really thinking
of singers, actors, musicians...

41:33.867 --> 41:35.677
dramatic artists.

41:36.203 --> 41:39.264
There were always so many
at my husband's house.

41:39.456 --> 41:43.727
May I let you know tomorrow?
It's too late to decide tonight.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.437
Is this late?

41:45.629 --> 41:49.774
Yes, because I still have to
talk business with Mr. Archer.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.156
Of course, Newland...

41:56.264 --> 41:59.784
if you can persuade the
countess to change her mind...

41:59.976 --> 42:01.620
you can join us too.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.583
You know painters, then?
You live in their milieu?

42:06.691 --> 42:09.836
- Not exactly.
- But you care about such things?

42:09.986 --> 42:13.715
Immensely. When I'm in Europe,
I never miss an exhibition.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.717
I try to keep up.

42:15.826 --> 42:18.011
I used to care immensely too.

42:18.119 --> 42:20.889
My life was full of such things.

42:21.498 --> 42:25.435
But now I want to cast off all
my old life to be an American...

42:25.544 --> 42:27.437
and be like everyone else.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.274
I doubt you'll ever quite
be like everybody else.

42:31.383 --> 42:35.028
Don't say that. I want to put
all the old things behind me.

42:35.136 --> 42:36.863
I know.

42:36.972 --> 42:39.157
Mr. Letterblair told me.

42:39.808 --> 42:41.493
Mr. Letterblair?

42:42.143 --> 42:45.622
Yes, I've come because he
asked me to. I'm in the firm.

42:46.731 --> 42:50.001
You mean it'll be you who'll
manage everything for me?

42:50.193 --> 42:54.297
- I can talk to you. That's easier.
- Yes, I'm here to talk about it.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.466
I've read all the legal papers.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.179
And the letter from the count.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.560
It was vile.

43:08.628 --> 43:12.524
But if he chooses to fight, he can
say things that might be un...

43:17.721 --> 43:21.032
That are disagreeable to you.
Say them publicly...

43:21.183 --> 43:24.244
so that they could be
damaging even if...

43:25.270 --> 43:26.454
If?

43:29.024 --> 43:31.293
Even if they were unfounded.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.715
What harm could accusations
like that do me here?

43:37.699 --> 43:40.594
Perhaps more harm
than anywhere else.

43:40.702 --> 43:44.973
Our legislation favors divorce,
but our social customs don't.

43:46.875 --> 43:47.976
Never?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.520
Well, not if the woman...

43:50.629 --> 43:52.731
has appearances...

43:53.465 --> 43:56.818
in the least degree against
her, has exposed herself...

43:57.552 --> 44:00.113
by any unconventional behavior...

44:00.931 --> 44:05.577
to offensive insinuations and...

44:06.228 --> 44:09.247
Yes. So my family tell me.

44:12.567 --> 44:15.337
Our family. You'll
be my cousin soon.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.675
And you agree with them?

44:30.460 --> 44:34.064
What could you possibly gain that
would make up for the scandal?

44:36.466 --> 44:38.193
My freedom.

44:39.803 --> 44:41.947
But aren't you free already?

44:44.808 --> 44:47.702
It's my business to help
you see these things...

44:47.811 --> 44:51.289
the way people who are
fondest of you see them.

44:51.398 --> 44:56.503
If I didn't show you how they judge
such matters, it wouldn't be fair.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.883
No, it wouldn't be fair.

45:09.583 --> 45:11.643
Very well.

45:12.752 --> 45:14.562
I'll do as you wish.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.695
I do want to help you.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.072
You do help me.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.412
Good night, cousin.

45:45.702 --> 45:48.680
For mercy's sake,
don't cry so bitterly.

45:48.788 --> 45:51.558
- Forget what I've done!
- On one condition.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.603
I accept it, whatever it may be.

45:56.004 --> 45:58.982
Never speak a word
of love to me again.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.358
Never!

46:05.931 --> 46:07.782
On my honor.

46:28.537 --> 46:30.305
Heaven bless you.

46:47.973 --> 46:49.240
Farewell.

47:22.591 --> 47:24.150
It's fascinating.

47:24.301 --> 47:28.196
Every season, same play, same
scene, same effect on the audience.

47:28.305 --> 47:30.073
Remarkable, isn't it?

47:30.182 --> 47:32.575
I'm enjoying this
more than in London.

47:32.684 --> 47:37.205
Do you see this play when you travel?
I'd travel to get away from it.

47:37.314 --> 47:40.834
- Was it a dinner?
- A reception at Mrs. Struthers'...

47:40.942 --> 47:42.544
given on the Lord's day...

47:42.611 --> 47:45.797
but with champagne and
singing from the tabletops.

47:45.906 --> 47:47.882
People say there was dancing.

47:47.991 --> 47:49.884
It was a French Sunday then?

47:49.993 --> 47:55.223
Dissipation can be wonderfully
energizing in the early stages...

47:58.460 --> 48:03.607
Do you think her lover will send her a
box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?

48:11.348 --> 48:15.535
I was thinking about that too.

48:18.230 --> 48:20.248
The farewell scene.

48:22.234 --> 48:24.127
Yes, I know.

48:24.986 --> 48:27.005
It touches me as well.

48:27.113 --> 48:31.551
I usually leave after that scene,
to take the picture away with me.

48:36.665 --> 48:39.809
I had a letter from May
from St. Augustine.

48:39.918 --> 48:44.648
They always spend the winter there,
on account of her mother's bronchitis.

48:47.133 --> 48:49.819
And what do you do
while May is away?

48:54.766 --> 48:56.618
I do my work.

49:07.779 --> 49:11.967
I do want you to know what
you advised me was right.

49:12.659 --> 49:15.971
Things can be so
difficult sometimes...

49:16.037 --> 49:18.556
and I'm so grateful.

49:32.429 --> 49:37.742
The next day, Newland Archer searched
the city in vain for yellow roses.

49:37.851 --> 49:40.578
He sent a note to Madame Olenska...

49:40.687 --> 49:45.834
asking to call that afternoon and
requesting a reply by messenger.

49:46.234 --> 49:49.754
There was no reply
that day or the next.

49:50.363 --> 49:53.675
And when yellow roses
were again available...

49:53.742 --> 49:56.011
Archer passed them by.

49:56.578 --> 50:00.557
It was only on the third day that
he heard from her by post...

50:00.665 --> 50:02.809
from the van der Luydens' home.

50:02.918 --> 50:08.023
"Newland, I ran away the day
after I saw you at the play...

50:08.173 --> 50:10.525
and these kind friends took me in.

50:10.592 --> 50:14.029
I wanted to be quiet
and think things over.

50:14.262 --> 50:18.116
I feel so safe here. I wish
that you were with us.

50:18.350 --> 50:20.285
Yours sincerely."

50:23.730 --> 50:28.126
He had received an invitation from the
Lefferts for a weekend on the Hudson.

50:28.235 --> 50:30.712
He hoped it was not
too late to reply.

50:30.779 --> 50:34.549
Their house was not far
from the van der Luydens'

50:48.421 --> 50:50.732
I came to see what
you ran away from.

50:52.467 --> 50:55.236
- I knew you'd come.
- That shows you wanted me to.

50:55.345 --> 50:57.781
May wrote she asked you
to take care of me.

50:57.889 --> 51:00.116
- I didn't need to be asked.
- Why?

51:00.225 --> 51:02.744
Am I so helpless and defenseless?

51:02.811 --> 51:05.872
Or are women here so blessed
they never feel need?

51:05.981 --> 51:07.499
What sort of need?

51:07.649 --> 51:11.419
Oh, please, don't ask me.
I don't speak your language.

51:14.281 --> 51:18.176
Henry left the patroon house open
for me. I want you to see it.

51:27.836 --> 51:30.105
When you wrote me,
you were unhappy.

51:31.339 --> 51:34.776
Yes, but I can't feel
unhappy when you're here.

51:42.893 --> 51:44.744
I shan't be here long.

51:44.853 --> 51:46.162
I know.

51:47.147 --> 51:50.250
If you really wanted me to come...

51:52.569 --> 51:55.130
if I'm really to help you...

51:58.366 --> 52:00.927
you must tell me what
you're running from.

52:50.418 --> 52:52.646
Is he what you're running from?

52:55.090 --> 52:56.358
Or what you expected?

52:56.466 --> 52:58.652
I didn't know he was here.

53:02.514 --> 53:03.615
Hello, Beaufort.

53:03.723 --> 53:06.743
This way. Madame Olenska
was expecting you.

53:07.769 --> 53:10.914
You've certainly led me
on a bit of a chase.

53:13.358 --> 53:17.254
All this way just to tell you I've
found the perfect house for you.

53:19.030 --> 53:22.092
It's not on the market yet,
so you must take it now.

53:23.285 --> 53:26.096
Well, Archer. Rusticating?

53:33.753 --> 53:36.773
That night he did not take
the customary comfort...

53:36.882 --> 53:39.943
in his monthly shipment
of London books.

53:40.051 --> 53:44.197
The taste of the usual was
like cinders in his mouth.

53:44.306 --> 53:47.075
There were moments when
he felt as if he were...

53:47.142 --> 53:49.953
being buried alive
under his future.

53:52.647 --> 53:57.085
Newland, come late tomorrow.
I must explain to you. Ellen.

54:22.469 --> 54:24.863
- Has anything happened?
- Yes.

54:25.222 --> 54:27.157
I found I had to see you.

54:32.270 --> 54:33.663
What is it?

54:33.772 --> 54:35.206
Nothing.

54:37.692 --> 54:39.711
Tell me what you do all day.

54:42.572 --> 54:44.716
There are a few very
pleasant people...

54:44.866 --> 54:48.303
from Philadelphia and Baltimore
picnicking at the inn.

54:48.370 --> 54:51.348
And the Merrys are setting
up a lawn tennis court...

54:51.456 --> 54:54.392
but nobody here has really
heard of the game yet, so...

54:54.918 --> 54:57.896
I have my racket and
so does Kate Merry...

55:09.057 --> 55:13.787
I came here because I thought I could
persuade you to break away from that.

55:13.895 --> 55:16.081
To advance our engagement.

55:17.774 --> 55:21.044
Don't you understand how
much I want to marry you?

55:21.153 --> 55:23.713
Why should we dream
away another year?

55:23.822 --> 55:26.091
I'm not sure I do understand.

55:28.827 --> 55:32.430
Are you not certain of feeling
the same way about me?

55:34.082 --> 55:35.767
What on earth do you mean?

55:37.085 --> 55:39.020
Is there someone else?

55:39.921 --> 55:41.690
Someone else?

55:42.424 --> 55:44.359
Between you and me?

55:46.303 --> 55:48.738
Let's talk frankly, Newland.

55:48.847 --> 55:52.367
I've felt a difference in you,
especially since our engagement.

55:52.434 --> 55:55.537
- What?
- If it's untrue, it won't hurt to talk.

55:55.645 --> 55:59.666
And if it is true, we should talk.
You might've made a mistake.

55:59.774 --> 56:04.129
If I'd made a mistake, would I
be asking to hurry our marriage?

56:04.404 --> 56:06.464
I don't know. You might.

56:07.073 --> 56:09.593
It'd be one way to
settle the question.

56:13.622 --> 56:16.224
In Newport, two years ago...

56:16.291 --> 56:18.685
before we were promised...

56:18.877 --> 56:21.521
everyone said there was
someone else for you.

56:21.630 --> 56:25.692
I saw you with her, sitting
together on a veranda at a dance.

56:25.967 --> 56:29.279
When she came into the house,
her face looked so sad...

56:29.387 --> 56:33.116
I felt sorry for her. Even
after, when we were engaged...

56:33.225 --> 56:35.160
I could still see how she looked...

56:35.685 --> 56:38.538
Is that all you've
been concerned about?

56:40.941 --> 56:42.876
It's long past.

56:46.154 --> 56:48.173
Then is there something else?

56:48.281 --> 56:49.674
No.

56:49.908 --> 56:51.885
Of course not.

56:53.328 --> 56:54.846
Whatever it may have been...

56:54.955 --> 56:58.850
I can't have my happiness made
out of a wrong to someone else.

56:58.959 --> 57:02.562
If promises were made, or if you
feel pledged to this person...

57:02.671 --> 57:07.233
even if it means her divorce,
don't give her up because of me.

57:07.342 --> 57:08.860
There are no pledges.

57:09.177 --> 57:11.947
There are no promises that matter.

57:13.139 --> 57:18.161
That's all I've been trying to say.
There is no one between us, May.

57:20.981 --> 57:24.251
Which is precisely my argument
for getting married...

57:25.193 --> 57:26.628
quickly.

57:33.535 --> 57:38.306
He could feel her dropping back
to inexpressive girlishness.

57:38.415 --> 57:41.518
Her conscience had been
eased of its burden.

57:41.626 --> 57:43.436
"It was wonderful," he thought...

57:43.545 --> 57:46.481
"how such depths of
feeling could coexist...

57:46.590 --> 57:50.026
with such an absence
of imagination."

57:52.345 --> 57:54.781
- And did you succeed?
- No.

57:54.890 --> 57:57.951
I'd still like to be married
in April, with your help.

57:58.059 --> 58:02.289
- Now you're seeing the Mingott way.
- Is this really so difficult?

58:02.397 --> 58:06.334
The family is difficult. Not one
of them wants to be different.

58:06.401 --> 58:09.421
And when they are, they end
up like Ellen's parents.

58:09.529 --> 58:12.257
Nomads. Continental wanderers.

58:12.365 --> 58:14.259
Dragging Ellen about.

58:14.367 --> 58:18.013
Lavishing on her an expensive
but incoherent education.

58:18.747 --> 58:23.351
Out of them all, there's not one that
takes after me but my little Ellen.

58:24.377 --> 58:28.857
You've got a quick eye. Why in
the world didn't you marry her?

58:31.635 --> 58:34.529
For one thing, she wasn't
there to be married.

58:34.888 --> 58:36.323
No, to be sure.

58:37.098 --> 58:39.034
And she's still not.

58:39.226 --> 58:41.119
The count, you know...

58:41.228 --> 58:43.455
wrote to Mr. Letterblair.

58:45.106 --> 58:46.541
He wants her back.

58:46.608 --> 58:49.044
On her own terms.

58:49.611 --> 58:53.381
The count doesn't defend
himself, I will say that.

58:53.448 --> 58:57.385
And Ellen will be losing a
great deal if she stayed here.

58:57.452 --> 59:00.555
There's her old life:
gardens at Nice...

59:00.622 --> 59:04.392
jewels, of course, music
and conversation.

59:04.501 --> 59:06.853
She says she goes
unnoticed in Europe.

59:06.962 --> 59:11.149
But I know her portrait's
been painted nine times.

59:11.633 --> 59:15.403
All this, and the remorse
of a guilty husband.

59:15.512 --> 59:17.697
I'd rather see her dead.

59:19.015 --> 59:20.116
Would you really?

59:21.226 --> 59:25.455
We should remember marriage is
marriage, and Ellen is still a wife.

59:27.399 --> 59:29.501
Ellen! See who's here!

59:30.485 --> 59:34.923
Yes, I know. I went to see your
mother to ask where you'd gone.

59:36.825 --> 59:41.304
Since you never answered my note,
I was afraid you might be ill.

59:41.413 --> 59:44.057
He was in a rush to get
married, that's why.

59:44.166 --> 59:48.728
Off the train and straight here.
He wants me to use my influence...

59:48.837 --> 59:51.106
to marry his sweetheart sooner.

59:52.757 --> 59:54.025
Well...

59:54.384 --> 59:58.571
Surely between us we can persuade
the Wellands to do as he wishes.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.700
Newland, you see? Right
to the problem, like me.

01:00:01.808 --> 01:00:04.202
I told him he should've
married you.

01:00:05.604 --> 01:00:07.747
And what did he say?

01:00:07.856 --> 01:00:11.293
Oh, my darling, I leave
you to find that out.

01:00:18.283 --> 01:00:21.928
I wish I didn't have to leave.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

01:00:22.037 --> 01:00:23.555
Fine.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:26.308
I'll see you out.

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.769
When can I see you?

01:00:49.523 --> 01:00:52.792
The Struthers are sending
the carriage at 7.

01:00:56.613 --> 01:00:57.756
Good evening.

01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:01.718
Who's so ridiculous
to send a bouquet?

01:01:01.827 --> 01:01:04.512
I'm not going to a ball,
and I'm not engaged.

01:01:04.621 --> 01:01:08.058
Nastasia. Some people
are always ridiculous.

01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:11.186
Take these to that nice
family down the street.

01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:18.443
Well...

01:01:18.552 --> 01:01:22.447
in almost everything she says
there's something true...

01:01:22.556 --> 01:01:24.157
and something untrue.

01:01:24.266 --> 01:01:25.533
Why?

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.994
What has Granny been telling you?

01:01:28.645 --> 01:01:31.706
She believes you might
go back to your husband.

01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:37.837
I think she believes you
might at least consider it.

01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:40.382
A lot of things have
been believed of me.

01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:46.721
But if she thinks I'd consider it,
it also means she'd consider it for me.

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:51.518
As Granny is weighing your idea
of advancing the marriage.

01:02:01.386 --> 01:02:04.781
May and I had a frank
talk in Florida.

01:02:06.892 --> 01:02:08.910
It's probably our first.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.623
She wants a long engagement
to give me time.

01:02:16.151 --> 01:02:17.961
Time for what?

01:02:19.279 --> 01:02:22.382
She thinks I want to
marry her at once...

01:02:23.283 --> 01:02:25.677
to get away from someone...

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.304
that I care for...

01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:29.055
more.

01:02:34.336 --> 01:02:37.063
Time to give her up
for another woman?

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:40.400
If I want to.

01:02:42.052 --> 01:02:43.862
It's very noble.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.280
Yes.

01:02:46.181 --> 01:02:47.908
It's ridiculous.

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:50.577
Why?

01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:53.663
Because there is no other woman?

01:02:54.397 --> 01:02:55.498
No.

01:02:55.607 --> 01:02:59.085
Because I don't mean
to marry anyone else.

01:03:06.326 --> 01:03:09.638
This other woman. Does
she love you too?

01:03:09.746 --> 01:03:13.516
There is no other woman. The
person May meant was never...

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:23.276
That must be your carriage.

01:03:23.468 --> 01:03:24.986
Yes...

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.616
I suppose I should be leaving soon.

01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:34.454
To Mrs. Struthers?

01:03:36.439 --> 01:03:37.832
Yes.

01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:41.878
I must go where I'm invited
or I should be too lonely.

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:48.885
Why not come with me?

01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:14.869
May guessed the truth.

01:04:17.981 --> 01:04:20.041
There is another woman.

01:04:24.154 --> 01:04:26.506
Only not the one she thinks.

01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:33.972
Don't make love to me.
Too many have done that.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.018
I never have. I'd have married
you had it been possible.

01:04:38.126 --> 01:04:41.062
- It's you who made it impossible.
- I've made it?!

01:04:41.129 --> 01:04:43.732
You made me give up divorcing.

01:04:43.798 --> 01:04:46.860
You talked to me, in this
house, about sacrifice...

01:04:46.968 --> 01:04:48.612
and sparing scandal!

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.323
For you and May, I
did what you asked!

01:04:51.431 --> 01:04:56.119
- The things in your husband's letter...
- I had nothing to fear from that.

01:04:56.603 --> 01:05:01.082
I was just afraid of scandal for
the family and you and May.

01:05:11.952 --> 01:05:13.219
Nothing's...

01:05:14.204 --> 01:05:17.057
Nothing's done that
can't be undone.

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.601
I'm still free.

01:05:21.878 --> 01:05:23.813
You can be too.

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:26.900
Please.

01:06:06.339 --> 01:06:10.568
Can I marry May now? Do you
see me marrying May now?

01:06:10.677 --> 01:06:13.113
I don't see you asking
May that, do you?

01:06:13.221 --> 01:06:15.991
I have to. It's too late
to do anything else.

01:06:16.099 --> 01:06:20.245
You say that because it's the easiest
thing to say, not because it's true.

01:06:20.437 --> 01:06:22.289
I don't understand you.

01:06:22.397 --> 01:06:27.294
Because you don't realize how
you've changed things for me.

01:06:27.402 --> 01:06:30.714
- You don't know all that you've done.
- All I've done?

01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:34.342
All the good things you've
done for me that I never knew.

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:38.888
Going to the van der Luydens
because people refused to meet me.

01:06:38.997 --> 01:06:41.308
Announcing your
engagement at the ball...

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:45.103
so there would be two families
behind me instead of one.

01:06:45.212 --> 01:06:48.690
I never understood how
dreadful people thought I was.

01:06:48.798 --> 01:06:53.737
Granny blurted it out one day.
I was stupid. I never thought...

01:06:53.929 --> 01:06:58.825
New York meant freedom to me.
Everyone seemed so kind...

01:06:58.975 --> 01:07:00.911
and glad to see me.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:08.460
They never knew what it meant to be
tempted, but you did. You understood.

01:07:09.319 --> 01:07:11.838
I'd never known that before...

01:07:12.989 --> 01:07:16.092
and it's better than
anything I've known.

01:07:21.915 --> 01:07:25.518
Newland, you couldn't be happy
if it meant being cruel.

01:07:26.878 --> 01:07:31.858
If we act any other way, you'll act
against what I love in you most.

01:07:32.968 --> 01:07:36.071
And I can't go back to
that way of thinking.

01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:41.284
Don't you see? I can't love
you unless I give you up.

01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:28.372
"Ellen, Granny's telegram succeeded.
Mama agreed to marriage after Easter.

01:08:28.482 --> 01:08:30.959
Only a month. I will
telegraph Newland.

01:08:31.067 --> 01:08:35.964
I'm too happy for words and love you
dearly. Your grateful cousin, May."

01:08:56.009 --> 01:08:57.986
There had been wild rumors...

01:08:58.053 --> 01:09:03.116
until the wedding that Mrs. Mingott
would actually attend the ceremony.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:06.620
She had sent a carpenter to
measure the front pew...

01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:09.747
in case it might be altered
to accommodate her.

01:09:09.898 --> 01:09:12.834
But this idea, like the
great lady herself...

01:09:12.901 --> 01:09:17.631
was unwieldy, and she settled for
giving the wedding breakfast.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:24.136
The Countess Olenska sent her regrets.
She was traveling with an aunt.

01:09:24.246 --> 01:09:28.642
But gave the bride and groom an
exquisite piece of old lace.

01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:33.520
Two elderly aunts in Rhinebeck
offered a honeymoon cottage.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:38.526
Since it was thought "very English"
to have a country house on loan...

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.154
their offer was accepted.

01:09:41.429 --> 01:09:45.200
When the house proved suddenly
uninhabitable, however...

01:09:45.392 --> 01:09:47.993
Henry van der Luyden offered...

01:09:48.103 --> 01:09:51.497
an old cottage on his
property nearby.

01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:55.710
May accepted the offer as a
surprise for her husband.

01:09:55.777 --> 01:10:00.215
She'd never seen the house, but her
cousin Ellen had mentioned it.

01:10:00.407 --> 01:10:03.718
She had said it was the
only house in America...

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:07.222
where she could imagine
being perfectly happy.

01:10:08.957 --> 01:10:13.395
They traveled to the expected
places, which May had never seen.

01:10:13.587 --> 01:10:18.316
In London, Archer ordered his clothes.
They went to the National Gallery...

01:10:18.425 --> 01:10:19.985
and to the theater.

01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:24.531
I hope I don't look ridiculous.
I've never dined out in London.

01:10:24.973 --> 01:10:28.285
English women dress like
everyone else in the evening.

01:10:28.393 --> 01:10:33.415
How can you say that when they're
at the theater in old ball dresses?

01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:36.418
Maybe they save their
new dresses for home.

01:10:36.985 --> 01:10:41.214
- Then I shouldn't have worn this.
- You look very fine.

01:10:42.491 --> 01:10:44.593
Really, quite beautiful.

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.602
In Paris, she ordered her clothes.

01:10:53.668 --> 01:10:56.396
There were trunks of
dresses from Worth.

01:10:56.505 --> 01:10:58.940
They visited the Tuileries.

01:11:06.348 --> 01:11:10.619
May's hands were modeled in
marble at Rochet's studio.

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:13.413
And occasionally, they dined out.

01:11:17.818 --> 01:11:22.297
But tell me, you were saying you
were actually advised by Maupassant?

01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:26.301
Unfortunately, I was
advised not to write.

01:11:29.079 --> 01:11:31.556
Archer embraced his new marriage...

01:11:31.665 --> 01:11:35.518
even as he reverted to his
old ideas about matrimony.

01:11:36.002 --> 01:11:39.439
It was less trouble to
conform with tradition.

01:11:39.756 --> 01:11:42.317
There was no use trying
to emancipate a wife...

01:11:42.425 --> 01:11:45.278
who hadn't the dimmest
notion that she wasn't free.

01:11:45.387 --> 01:11:48.657
In London we only managed
one day at the National.

01:11:48.765 --> 01:11:52.285
We were taken up by a
Mrs. Carfry and Mrs. Harle.

01:11:53.353 --> 01:11:55.121
We had a good talk.

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:59.960
He's interesting. We talked about
books and many different things.

01:12:00.819 --> 01:12:03.004
I thought I'd invite him to dinner.

01:12:03.113 --> 01:12:05.006
- The Frenchman?
- Yes.

01:12:05.073 --> 01:12:09.511
I didn't have much chance to talk to
him, but wasn't he a little common?

01:12:09.953 --> 01:12:11.388
Common?

01:12:12.539 --> 01:12:14.557
I thought he was clever.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:18.728
I suppose I shouldn't have
known if he was clever.

01:12:22.382 --> 01:12:24.734
Then I won't ask him to dine.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.156
With a chill, he knew
that in future...

01:12:30.891 --> 01:12:35.745
many problems would be solved
for him in this same way.

01:12:37.647 --> 01:12:41.793
The first six months of marriage
were said to be the hardest...

01:12:41.902 --> 01:12:43.461
and after that...

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:47.882
they would have nearly finished
polishing down all the rough edges.

01:12:47.991 --> 01:12:50.844
But May's pressure was
already wearing down...

01:12:50.994 --> 01:12:54.347
the very roughness he
most wanted to keep.

01:12:54.498 --> 01:12:58.435
As for the madness with Madame
Olenska, he trained himself...

01:12:58.543 --> 01:13:03.106
to remember it as the last of
his discarded experiments.

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.235
She remained in his memory
simply as the most plaintive...

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:09.029
and poignant...

01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:11.364
of a line of ghosts.

01:13:44.965 --> 01:13:46.691
She's very deft.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.986
That's the only kind of
target she'll ever hit.

01:13:57.185 --> 01:14:00.080
No one could ever be
jealous of May's triumphs.

01:14:00.564 --> 01:14:05.001
She gave the feeling that she would've
been just as serene without them.

01:14:08.196 --> 01:14:11.758
But what if all her
calm, her niceness...

01:14:11.867 --> 01:14:13.760
were just a negation...

01:14:14.244 --> 01:14:17.639
a curtain dropped in
front of an emptiness?

01:14:18.039 --> 01:14:21.893
Archer felt he had never
yet lifted that curtain.

01:14:23.295 --> 01:14:25.772
Quite stunning, isn't it?

01:14:26.381 --> 01:14:30.193
It's Julius Beaufort who donates
the club's prizes, isn't it?

01:14:30.302 --> 01:14:34.864
This looks like him, of course.
It will make quite an heirloom.

01:14:34.973 --> 01:14:37.617
You should leave it to
your eldest daughter.

01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:40.453
What? Will there be no daughters?

01:14:40.562 --> 01:14:45.208
Only sons? Can't I say that either?
Look at her blushing.

01:14:45.901 --> 01:14:48.712
Ellen! Ellen! Are you upstairs?

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.840
She's over from Portsmouth,
spending the day.

01:14:51.907 --> 01:14:55.051
It's such a nuisance. She
won't stay in Newport.

01:14:55.243 --> 01:14:59.472
Insists on putting up with those...
What's their name? Blenkers.

01:14:59.664 --> 01:15:03.435
But I gave up arguing with
young people 50 years ago.

01:15:04.127 --> 01:15:07.397
I'm sorry, ma'am. Miss
Ellen's not in the house.

01:15:07.506 --> 01:15:11.443
- She's left?
- I saw her going down the shore path.

01:15:13.595 --> 01:15:16.406
Run down and fetch her
like a good grandson.

01:15:16.515 --> 01:15:19.784
May and I will have a gossip
about Julius Beaufort.

01:15:19.893 --> 01:15:22.412
Go ahead. She'll want
to see you both.

01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:26.249
Is it true Beaufort has given
Annie Ring a diamond bracelet?

01:15:26.358 --> 01:15:29.336
I hear he even plans to
bring her to Newport.

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:42.057
He'd heard her name often during the
year and a half since they'd last met.

01:15:42.374 --> 01:15:46.311
He was even familiar with the
main incidents of her life.

01:15:46.545 --> 01:15:50.065
But he heard all these
accounts with detachment...

01:15:50.215 --> 01:15:55.028
as if listening to reminiscences
of someone long dead.

01:15:55.303 --> 01:15:58.740
But the past had come
again into the present...

01:15:58.974 --> 01:16:02.494
as in those newly discovered
caverns in Tuscany...

01:16:02.644 --> 01:16:05.747
where children had lit
bunches of straw...

01:16:05.814 --> 01:16:09.668
and seen old images
staring from the wall.

01:16:20.453 --> 01:16:22.973
He gave himself a single chance.

01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:27.769
She must turn before the sailboat
crosses the Lime Rock light.

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.605
Then he would go to her.

01:17:20.222 --> 01:17:23.700
I'm sorry you didn't find her,
but I've heard she's changed.

01:17:23.809 --> 01:17:24.910
Changed?

01:17:25.018 --> 01:17:28.788
So indifferent to her old friends.
Summering in Portsmouth.

01:17:28.897 --> 01:17:33.209
Moving to Washington. Sometimes,
I think we've always bored her.

01:17:33.318 --> 01:17:36.671
Perhaps she'd be happier
with her husband after all.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.467
- I've never heard you be cruel before.
- Cruel?

01:17:40.575 --> 01:17:44.179
Even demons don't think
people are happier in hell.

01:17:44.496 --> 01:17:47.057
Then she shouldn't
have married abroad.

01:17:47.415 --> 01:17:48.767
Let me.

01:17:48.917 --> 01:17:50.101
Walk on.

01:17:50.502 --> 01:17:51.978
The Blenkers?

01:17:52.087 --> 01:17:54.439
A party for the Blenkers?

01:17:54.673 --> 01:17:56.107
Who are they?

01:17:56.925 --> 01:18:00.362
The Portsmouth people.
The ones Ellen is staying with.

01:18:00.428 --> 01:18:04.574
"Professor and Mrs. Sillerton request
the pleasure Wednesday afternoon...

01:18:04.683 --> 01:18:08.745
at 3:00 punctually to meet
Mrs. and the Misses Blenker.

01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:11.206
Red Gables, Catherine Street."

01:18:11.273 --> 01:18:13.875
I don't think we can decline.

01:18:14.192 --> 01:18:18.004
I don't see why, really.
He's an archaeologist...

01:18:18.113 --> 01:18:20.882
And he's Sillerton
Jackson's cousin.

01:18:21.783 --> 01:18:24.886
- Of course.
- Some of us will have to go.

01:18:24.953 --> 01:18:28.139
I'll go over. Janey, why
don't you come with me?

01:18:28.248 --> 01:18:31.935
I'm sure Ellen will be there.
You'll have a chance to see her.

01:18:32.544 --> 01:18:36.398
Newland, you can find a way to
spend your afternoon, can't you?

01:18:36.965 --> 01:18:41.486
I think for a change I'll just
save it instead of spending it.

01:18:42.804 --> 01:18:46.241
Maybe I'll go see about a
new horse for the brougham.

01:18:48.477 --> 01:18:53.081
At least the Jacksons didn't pick the
day of the Cup Race for their party.

01:20:07.389 --> 01:20:08.615
Hello?

01:20:12.144 --> 01:20:16.289
I'm sorry, did you ring? I've
been asleep in the hammock.

01:20:18.817 --> 01:20:21.002
I didn't mean to disturb you.

01:20:21.319 --> 01:20:24.464
Are you Miss Blenker?
I'm Newland Archer.

01:20:24.573 --> 01:20:26.508
I've heard so much about you.

01:20:26.575 --> 01:20:31.513
I came up to look for a new horse.
I thought I'd call, but no one's home.

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.682
Yes, they're all at the party.

01:20:33.748 --> 01:20:37.686
Everyone's there but me with
my fever and Countess Olenska.

01:20:38.336 --> 01:20:41.189
Oh, you found my parasol!

01:20:43.508 --> 01:20:46.319
It's my best one. It's
from the Cameroons.

01:20:46.428 --> 01:20:48.113
It's very pretty.

01:20:49.014 --> 01:20:51.199
The countess was called away?

01:20:51.475 --> 01:20:55.870
Yes, a telegram came from Boston. She
said she might be gone two days.

01:20:56.188 --> 01:20:59.082
I do love the way she
does her hair, don't you?

01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:02.043
It reminds me of Sir Walter Scott.

01:21:03.778 --> 01:21:07.340
You don't know... I have
to be in Boston tomorrow.

01:21:07.449 --> 01:21:09.759
Do you know where she's staying?

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.673
I'm here on business.
I just got here, actually.

01:21:59.084 --> 01:22:02.103
- Your hair is different.
- My maid's not with me.

01:22:02.462 --> 01:22:07.317
She stayed in Portsmouth. I'm here
only two days. It's not worthwhile.

01:22:07.425 --> 01:22:09.527
You are traveling alone?

01:22:10.137 --> 01:22:14.991
Yes. Why? Do you think
it's a little dangerous?

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.912
- Well, it's unconventional.
- Yes, I suppose it is.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.082
I just did something so
much more unconventional.

01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:25.085
I refused to take back
money that belonged to me.

01:22:27.279 --> 01:22:29.297
Someone came with an offer?

01:22:32.909 --> 01:22:34.552
What were the conditions?

01:22:36.037 --> 01:22:38.223
- I refused.
- Tell me the conditions.

01:22:38.331 --> 01:22:43.061
Nothing unbearable, really. To sit at
the head of his table now and then.

01:22:45.714 --> 01:22:48.275
And he wants you back at any price?

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:52.487
Well, it's a considerable price.

01:22:53.054 --> 01:22:55.740
At least, it's considerable for me.

01:22:57.058 --> 01:22:59.286
So you came to see him?

01:22:59.394 --> 01:23:02.497
My husband? Here?
No, of course not.

01:23:02.814 --> 01:23:04.749
He sent someone.

01:23:06.151 --> 01:23:07.586
His secretary?

01:23:09.738 --> 01:23:11.089
Yes.

01:23:12.824 --> 01:23:15.468
He's still here. He insisted on...

01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:19.598
waiting in case I changed my mind.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.272
You haven't changed, Newland.

01:23:31.092 --> 01:23:34.029
I had changed until
I saw you again.

01:23:35.013 --> 01:23:36.489
Please don't.

01:23:36.598 --> 01:23:41.119
Just give me the day. I won't
speak unless you tell me to.

01:23:41.645 --> 01:23:44.289
All I want is some time with you.

01:23:45.398 --> 01:23:47.876
Is that man coming to the hotel?

01:23:48.026 --> 01:23:50.545
- At 11:00, just...
- We must go now.

01:23:55.617 --> 01:23:58.845
- I must leave a note at the hotel.
- Write on this.

01:23:58.954 --> 01:24:02.599
I have the paper. You see how
everything is predestined?

01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:06.436
And these, have you seen this?
The new stylographic pen.

01:24:06.628 --> 01:24:11.149
It's like jerking down the
mercury in a thermometer.

01:24:12.717 --> 01:24:14.319
Try that.

01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:17.405
It's not working.

01:24:18.515 --> 01:24:20.075
That should do it.

01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:24.663
- Shall I take it in?
- I'll be only a moment.

01:25:06.771 --> 01:25:10.917
Why didn't you come to the beach
for me the day I was at Granny's?

01:25:11.026 --> 01:25:13.461
Because you didn't turn around.

01:25:15.697 --> 01:25:19.009
I swore I wouldn't call you
unless you turned around.

01:25:19.618 --> 01:25:22.262
But I didn't look
around on purpose.

01:25:23.622 --> 01:25:25.015
You knew?

01:25:25.165 --> 01:25:27.934
I recognized the carriage
when you drove in.

01:25:29.044 --> 01:25:32.272
So I went to the beach.

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.774
To get as far away
from me as you could.

01:25:34.883 --> 01:25:38.737
- As I could, yes.
- It's better we face each other.

01:25:38.845 --> 01:25:43.366
- I only want to be honest with you.
- Isn't that why you admire Beaufort?

01:25:43.475 --> 01:25:47.037
He's more honest than the rest
of us. We've no character...

01:25:47.479 --> 01:25:49.748
no color, no variety.

01:25:50.899 --> 01:25:53.752
Why don't you just
go back to Europe?

01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:57.964
- I believe that's because of you.
- Me?

01:25:58.073 --> 01:26:01.468
I married one woman because
another told me to.

01:26:04.579 --> 01:26:07.557
You promised not to say
such things today.

01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:09.809
I can't keep that promise.

01:26:10.252 --> 01:26:13.688
What about May? What
about how May feels?

01:26:13.797 --> 01:26:16.691
If you're using my marriage
as some victory...

01:26:16.758 --> 01:26:20.278
then there's no reason why
you shouldn't go back.

01:26:20.428 --> 01:26:24.324
You gave me my first
glimpse of a real life...

01:26:24.432 --> 01:26:27.953
and then you told me to
carry on with a false one.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:32.457
No one can endure that.

01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:37.545
I'm enduring it.

01:26:46.955 --> 01:26:49.933
- I know you'll go back.
- I won't.

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:55.230
Not yet. Not as long as
we both can stand it.

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:58.233
- This is not a life for you.
- It is.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.735
As long as it's part of yours.

01:27:14.858 --> 01:27:16.501
You won't go back?

01:27:18.278 --> 01:27:20.088
I won't go back.

01:27:26.661 --> 01:27:28.805
He would see her again...

01:27:28.914 --> 01:27:31.683
at the theater or a reception.

01:27:31.833 --> 01:27:34.644
Perhaps he might be
seated next to her.

01:27:34.753 --> 01:27:38.607
Perhaps they might have
another time alone somewhere.

01:27:38.757 --> 01:27:42.360
But he could not live
without seeing her.

01:28:25.887 --> 01:28:27.697
Mr. Archer, I think?

01:28:28.223 --> 01:28:29.366
Yes.

01:28:29.474 --> 01:28:31.326
My name is Riviere.

01:28:31.893 --> 01:28:34.621
I dined with you in
Paris last year.

01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:37.249
Yes, I'm sorry.
I didn't quite recall.

01:28:37.357 --> 01:28:42.128
I had the advantage. I saw
you in Boston, yesterday.

01:28:45.365 --> 01:28:49.135
I came here on Count
Olenski's behalf because...

01:28:49.411 --> 01:28:52.889
I believed in all good faith
that she should return to him.

01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:57.394
Forgive me, monsieur...

01:28:57.502 --> 01:29:02.857
but I really don't understand
your purpose in coming to see me.

01:29:04.301 --> 01:29:06.152
She's changed, monsieur.

01:29:07.596 --> 01:29:09.406
You knew her before?

01:29:09.848 --> 01:29:12.409
I used to see her at
her husband's house.

01:29:12.517 --> 01:29:15.912
The count would not have entrusted
my mission to a stranger.

01:29:17.105 --> 01:29:19.874
This change that you mentioned...

01:29:20.066 --> 01:29:22.669
It may be my seeing her
for the first time...

01:29:23.403 --> 01:29:26.673
as she is, as an American.

01:29:26.865 --> 01:29:29.301
She made her marriage
in good faith.

01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:33.430
It was a faith the
count could not share.

01:29:33.538 --> 01:29:35.724
Could not understand.

01:29:36.082 --> 01:29:38.393
So her faith was...

01:29:40.754 --> 01:29:42.022
Broken.

01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:44.190
Destroyed.

01:29:45.926 --> 01:29:49.362
Returning to Europe would mean
a life of some comfort...

01:29:50.764 --> 01:29:53.408
and considerable sacrifice...

01:29:54.434 --> 01:29:56.411
and I would think, no hope.

01:29:58.355 --> 01:30:03.418
I will fulfill my obligation to the
count and meet with the family.

01:30:03.485 --> 01:30:08.048
I will tell them what he suggests
and wishes for the countess.

01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:12.218
But I ask you to use your
influence with them.

01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:17.265
I beg you, do not let her go back.

01:30:20.335 --> 01:30:24.522
When old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow died,
they found her standing order...

01:30:24.631 --> 01:30:28.777
48 Worth dresses, still
wrapped in tissue paper.

01:30:28.885 --> 01:30:32.030
When her daughters left
off their mourning...

01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:34.532
they wore the first lot
to the symphony...

01:30:34.641 --> 01:30:37.744
without looking in
advance of the fashion.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.581
He had written to her
once in Washington.

01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:46.253
Just a few lines, asking when
they were to meet again.

01:30:46.987 --> 01:30:50.298
And she wrote back, "Not yet."

01:30:53.702 --> 01:30:56.930
I think Julius Beaufort
started the new fashion...

01:30:57.038 --> 01:31:00.976
by making his wife wear her new
clothes when they arrived.

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:05.480
I must say, it takes all Regina's
distinction not to look like...

01:31:05.547 --> 01:31:08.775
- Her rivals?
- Like that Annie Ring.

01:31:08.884 --> 01:31:12.237
- Careful, dear.
- Everybody knows.

01:31:12.345 --> 01:31:15.740
Indeed. Beaufort always
put his business around.

01:31:15.849 --> 01:31:19.369
Now that his business is gone,
there will be disclosures.

01:31:19.478 --> 01:31:24.082
- Gone? Is it really that bad?
- As bad as anything I ever heard of.

01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:27.919
Most everybody we know will
be hit one way or another.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.968
Very difficult for
Regina, of course.

01:31:35.076 --> 01:31:39.889
And it's a pity that Countess Olenska
refused her husband's offer.

01:31:40.832 --> 01:31:42.392
Why, for God's sake?

01:31:42.501 --> 01:31:46.229
To put it on the lowest ground,
what will she live on now?

01:31:46.338 --> 01:31:47.856
Now that Beaufort...

01:31:48.131 --> 01:31:50.358
What the hell does that mean, sir?

01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:58.074
Most of her money's
invested with Beaufort...

01:31:58.183 --> 01:32:01.661
and the allowance she gets
from the family is cut back...

01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:04.331
- I'm sure she has something.
- A little.

01:32:04.564 --> 01:32:07.792
Whatever remains, after
sustaining more debt.

01:32:08.527 --> 01:32:11.671
I know the family paid close
attention to Riviere...

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.049
and considered his offer carefully.

01:32:14.157 --> 01:32:17.594
If everyone rather she be
Beaufort's mistress than a wife...

01:32:17.702 --> 01:32:19.846
you've gone about it perfectly.

01:32:21.498 --> 01:32:23.308
She won't go back.

01:32:25.502 --> 01:32:27.395
That's your opinion?

01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:31.399
Well, no doubt you know.

01:32:33.385 --> 01:32:38.198
She might soften Mrs. Mingott, who
could give her any kind of allowance.

01:32:38.306 --> 01:32:41.743
But the rest of the family
don't want to keep her here.

01:32:41.893 --> 01:32:43.745
They'll simply let her...

01:32:44.312 --> 01:32:46.164
find her own level.

01:32:58.952 --> 01:33:00.136
Thank you.

01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:09.896
The lamp is smoking again.
The servant should fix it.

01:33:10.005 --> 01:33:11.523
I'm sorry.

01:33:19.598 --> 01:33:22.409
I may have to go to
Washington for a few days.

01:33:22.517 --> 01:33:23.743
When?

01:33:24.519 --> 01:33:27.914
Tomorrow. I'm sorry,
I should have said it before.

01:33:28.732 --> 01:33:30.417
On business?

01:33:30.525 --> 01:33:34.004
There's a patent case coming
up before the Supreme Court.

01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:37.173
I just got the papers
from Letterblair.

01:33:37.282 --> 01:33:42.262
Never mind. It's too complicated.
I have enough trouble with this lamp.

01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:43.888
Let me try that.

01:33:44.873 --> 01:33:46.808
The change will do you good.

01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:50.145
And you must be sure
to go and see Ellen.

01:33:56.843 --> 01:33:59.279
This came for you
while you were out.

01:34:01.223 --> 01:34:04.659
- Do something about this, will you?
- Certainly, sir.

01:34:07.562 --> 01:34:09.581
Granny's had a stroke.

01:34:11.942 --> 01:34:13.752
A stroke?

01:34:14.236 --> 01:34:15.837
Ridiculous.

01:34:15.946 --> 01:34:20.508
I told them all it was just
an excess of Thanksgiving.

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:27.307
Dr. Bencomb acted most concerned and
insisted on notifying everyone...

01:34:27.415 --> 01:34:31.978
as if it were the last reading of
my will. You're dear to come.

01:34:33.004 --> 01:34:36.399
But perhaps you only wanted
to see what I'd left you.

01:34:36.508 --> 01:34:38.944
Granny, that's shocking!

01:34:39.052 --> 01:34:42.322
It was shock that did this
to me. No, thank you.

01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:44.908
It's all due to Regina Beaufort.

01:34:45.433 --> 01:34:48.119
She came here last night...

01:34:48.228 --> 01:34:49.996
and she asked me...

01:34:50.105 --> 01:34:54.668
She asked me... She
had the effrontery...

01:34:54.776 --> 01:34:58.171
to ask me to back Julius.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.091
"Not to desert him," she said.

01:35:01.199 --> 01:35:06.346
"To stand behind our common
lineage in the Townsend family."

01:35:06.454 --> 01:35:10.725
If you back Julius, you can
see the family through.

01:35:11.585 --> 01:35:13.061
If you don't...

01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:15.188
we will all...

01:35:15.797 --> 01:35:18.775
everyone of us, fall into dishonor.

01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:23.655
I said to her: Honor's
always been honor...

01:35:23.763 --> 01:35:27.325
and honesty's always been
honesty in the Mingott house...

01:35:27.434 --> 01:35:31.538
and will be till I'm
carried out feet first.

01:35:32.439 --> 01:35:37.419
And then she said, if you can believe
this, "But my name, Auntie."

01:35:37.486 --> 01:35:39.546
But my name, Auntie!

01:35:39.779 --> 01:35:43.133
- My name's Regina Townsend!
- I said to her:

01:35:43.241 --> 01:35:46.845
Your name was Beaufort when
he covered you with jewels...

01:35:46.953 --> 01:35:51.224
and it's got to stay Beaufort now
that he's covered you with shame.

01:35:53.835 --> 01:35:55.604
Then I gave out.

01:35:57.005 --> 01:35:59.107
Simply gave out.

01:35:59.508 --> 01:36:03.028
And now family is arriving
expecting a funeral...

01:36:03.136 --> 01:36:05.906
and they'll have to be entertained.

01:36:06.014 --> 01:36:09.409
I don't know how many
notes Bencomb sent out.

01:36:09.518 --> 01:36:13.371
- If there's anything we can do.
- Well, Ellen is coming.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.832
I expressly asked for her.

01:36:15.941 --> 01:36:19.085
She arrives today on the
train, if you'd fetch her.

01:36:19.194 --> 01:36:22.088
If May sends the brougham,
I'll take the ferry.

01:36:22.197 --> 01:36:23.256
Fine.

01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:25.759
Fine. Thank you.

01:36:26.827 --> 01:36:30.013
There, you see, Granny,
everyone will be settled.

01:36:30.205 --> 01:36:33.308
Thank you, dear. Bless you.

01:36:34.334 --> 01:36:36.353
I didn't want to worry Granny...

01:36:36.461 --> 01:36:40.899
but how can you meet Ellen if you
have to go to Washington today?

01:36:41.007 --> 01:36:45.737
I'm not going. The case is postponed.
I heard from Letterblair this morning.

01:36:45.846 --> 01:36:48.782
Postponed? How odd.

01:36:48.932 --> 01:36:51.576
Mama had a note from
him this morning too.

01:36:51.685 --> 01:36:54.788
He was concerned about
Granny but had to be away.

01:36:54.938 --> 01:36:58.166
He was arguing a patent case
before the Supreme Court.

01:36:58.275 --> 01:37:00.293
You did say it was a patent case?

01:37:00.402 --> 01:37:04.130
The whole office can't go.
Letterblair decided to go himself.

01:37:04.239 --> 01:37:06.174
Then it's not postponed?

01:37:07.242 --> 01:37:09.469
No, but my going is.

01:37:18.253 --> 01:37:21.356
He knew it was two hours
by ferry and carriage...

01:37:21.465 --> 01:37:26.194
from the Pennsylvania terminus in
Jersey City to Mrs. Mingott's.

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.284
All of two hours and
maybe a little more.

01:37:35.896 --> 01:37:37.789
- You didn't expect me?
- No.

01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:41.501
I nearly came to Washington.
We would've missed each other.

01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:44.379
Granny Mingott sent me.
She's much better.

01:37:56.458 --> 01:38:01.021
- You know, I hardly remembered you.
- Hardly remembered?

01:38:01.922 --> 01:38:04.190
I mean, each time is the same.

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:07.569
You happen to me all over again.

01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:10.572
Yes, I know.

01:38:11.014 --> 01:38:12.574
For me too.

01:39:05.193 --> 01:39:08.588
Ellen, we can't stay like
this. It can't last.

01:39:09.489 --> 01:39:13.760
- We must look at reality, not dreams.
- I want us to be together.

01:39:13.869 --> 01:39:18.139
I can't be your wife. Is it your
idea I should be your mistress?

01:39:19.374 --> 01:39:24.813
I want us to find a world where
words like that don't exist.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.606
Oh, my dear.

01:39:29.009 --> 01:39:32.320
Where is that country?
Have you ever been there?

01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:37.617
Can we be happy behind the
backs of people who trust us?

01:39:37.726 --> 01:39:40.996
- I'm beyond caring about that.
- No, you're not.

01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:44.165
You've never been beyond that.

01:39:44.858 --> 01:39:46.459
I have.

01:39:47.903 --> 01:39:51.506
I know what it looks like.
It's no place for us.

01:40:04.544 --> 01:40:07.480
Why are we stopping?
This isn't Granny's.

01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:09.024
I'll get out here.

01:40:14.054 --> 01:40:16.865
You were right, I shouldn't
have come today.

01:40:58.098 --> 01:40:59.866
What are you reading?

01:41:02.435 --> 01:41:04.537
It's a book about Japan.

01:41:06.106 --> 01:41:07.249
Why?

01:41:08.942 --> 01:41:10.543
I don't know.

01:41:11.444 --> 01:41:13.713
Because it's a different country.

01:41:15.157 --> 01:41:17.384
You used to read poetry.

01:41:17.492 --> 01:41:19.970
It was so nice when
you read it to me.

01:41:34.134 --> 01:41:36.069
You'll catch your death.

01:41:42.184 --> 01:41:43.952
Of course.

01:41:45.312 --> 01:41:48.415
But then he realized, "I am dead.

01:41:48.815 --> 01:41:51.585
I've been dead for
months and months."

01:41:52.152 --> 01:41:55.088
Then it occurred to him
that she might die.

01:41:56.156 --> 01:42:00.135
People did. Young people,
healthy people did.

01:42:00.368 --> 01:42:03.930
She might die and set him free.

01:42:25.393 --> 01:42:27.454
Ellen, I have to see you.

01:42:29.481 --> 01:42:33.043
- I didn't know when you were leaving.
- I'm not leaving.

01:42:33.151 --> 01:42:35.754
Granny's asked me to
take care of her.

01:42:35.862 --> 01:42:38.548
- Then we must talk now.
- I'm due at Regina's.

01:42:38.657 --> 01:42:40.467
Granny lent me her carriage.

01:42:40.575 --> 01:42:44.012
Granny says Beaufort's a
scoundrel, but so is my husband...

01:42:44.079 --> 01:42:46.765
and the family wants
me to return to him.

01:42:46.873 --> 01:42:51.519
Only Granny understands. She's
even seen to my allowance.

01:42:51.628 --> 01:42:54.439
- I must see you somewhere alone.
- In New York?

01:42:54.548 --> 01:42:56.274
Where we can be alone.

01:42:56.424 --> 01:42:59.319
The art museum in the park.
2:30 tomorrow.

01:42:59.427 --> 01:43:01.154
I'll be at the door.

01:43:09.771 --> 01:43:13.333
You came to New York
because you were afraid.

01:43:13.441 --> 01:43:15.710
- Afraid?
- Of my coming to Washington.

01:43:15.819 --> 01:43:18.004
I thought I would be safer.

01:43:18.113 --> 01:43:19.422
Safer from me?

01:43:23.451 --> 01:43:24.678
Ellen?

01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:34.062
Safer from loving me?

01:43:41.303 --> 01:43:44.739
Shall I come to you
once and then go home?

01:43:55.233 --> 01:43:57.335
Come to me once then.

01:44:02.824 --> 01:44:04.092
When?

01:44:07.579 --> 01:44:09.097
Tomorrow.

01:44:16.004 --> 01:44:17.689
The day after.

01:44:49.037 --> 01:44:53.391
I'm sorry I'm late. You
weren't worried, were you?

01:44:53.625 --> 01:44:56.478
- Is it late?
- It's past 7.

01:44:56.586 --> 01:44:59.564
I stayed at Granny's
because Ellen came in.

01:44:59.714 --> 01:45:02.901
We had a wonderful talk.
She was so dear.

01:45:03.009 --> 01:45:07.155
Just like the old Ellen.
Granny was so charmed by her.

01:45:07.305 --> 01:45:10.909
You can see how the family's
been annoyed with her at times.

01:45:11.017 --> 01:45:13.995
Going to see Regina Beaufort
in Granny's carriage.

01:45:14.104 --> 01:45:16.164
Are we dining out tonight?

01:45:20.277 --> 01:45:22.379
You haven't kissed me today.

01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:42.399
It was the custom in old New
York for brides to appear...

01:45:42.507 --> 01:45:46.736
in their wedding dress during
the first years of marriage.

01:45:46.845 --> 01:45:49.489
But May, since returning
from Europe...

01:45:49.598 --> 01:45:53.201
had not worn her bridal
satin until this evening.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.120
May, I'm sorry.

01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:41.583
My head's bursting. Please don't
tell anyone. Come home with me.

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:56.598
Shouldn't you rest?

01:46:57.916 --> 01:47:00.101
My head's not as bad as that.

01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:04.773
And there's something important
I must say to you right away.

01:47:26.486 --> 01:47:29.422
There's something that
I've got to tell you...

01:47:31.366 --> 01:47:33.051
about myself.

01:47:38.373 --> 01:47:39.683
Madame Olenska...

01:47:39.791 --> 01:47:42.394
Why should we talk
about Ellen tonight?

01:47:44.546 --> 01:47:46.982
Because I should have
spoken before...

01:47:47.048 --> 01:47:48.858
Is it really worthwhile?

01:47:49.217 --> 01:47:54.072
I know I've been unfair to her
at times. Perhaps we all have.

01:47:54.222 --> 01:47:59.619
You understood her better than us, but
does it matter now that it's over?

01:48:01.730 --> 01:48:03.456
How do you mean, "over"?

01:48:04.232 --> 01:48:07.335
Why, since she's going
back to Europe so soon.

01:48:08.069 --> 01:48:11.256
Granny approves and understands.
She's disappointed...

01:48:11.364 --> 01:48:16.303
but she's arranged to make Ellen
financially independent of the count.

01:48:16.411 --> 01:48:19.598
I thought you would have
heard today at your offices.

01:48:33.094 --> 01:48:35.822
- It's impossible.
- Impossible?

01:48:35.931 --> 01:48:40.952
She could stay with Granny's money,
but I guess she's given us up.

01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:43.997
How do you know that?

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.919
From Ellen. I told you, I saw
her at Granny's yesterday.

01:48:49.611 --> 01:48:51.838
And she told you yesterday?

01:48:53.698 --> 01:48:54.925
No.

01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:57.969
She sent me a note this afternoon.

01:49:02.124 --> 01:49:03.808
Do you want to see it?

01:49:13.468 --> 01:49:14.861
I thought you knew.

01:49:29.818 --> 01:49:33.630
"May, dear: I have at last
made Granny understand...

01:49:33.738 --> 01:49:36.883
that my visit to her could
be no more than a visit.

01:49:36.992 --> 01:49:40.095
And she has been as kind
and generous as ever."

01:49:42.998 --> 01:49:47.102
She sees now that if I return to
Europe, I must live by myself.

01:49:47.377 --> 01:49:51.690
I am hurrying back to Washington
to pack up, and I sail next week.

01:49:52.257 --> 01:49:55.026
Be very good to
Granny when I'm gone.

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.779
As good as you've
always been to me.

01:49:58.972 --> 01:50:03.577
If friends wish to urge me to stay,
tell them it'd be utterly useless.

01:50:03.685 --> 01:50:06.037
"...tell them it'd
be utterly useless."

01:50:17.532 --> 01:50:19.384
Why did she write this?

01:50:21.369 --> 01:50:24.764
I suppose because we talked
things over yesterday.

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.058
What things?

01:50:27.209 --> 01:50:31.062
I told her that I was afraid I
hadn't always been fair to her...

01:50:31.713 --> 01:50:35.775
and hadn't always understood how
hard it must have been for her.

01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:39.029
I knew she could
always count on you...

01:50:39.137 --> 01:50:43.658
and I wanted her to know that you and
I were the same in our feelings.

01:50:45.101 --> 01:50:48.246
She understood why I
wanted to tell her this.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.416
I think she understands everything.

01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:04.304
My head aches too.

01:51:07.082 --> 01:51:09.643
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

01:51:27.769 --> 01:51:32.207
It was, as Mrs. Archer said,
a great event for a young couple...

01:51:32.315 --> 01:51:36.670
to give their first dinner. It was
not to be undertaken lightly.

01:51:37.112 --> 01:51:41.841
There was a hired chef, two borrowed
footmen, roses from Hendersons...

01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:45.554
Roman punch, and menus
on gilt-edged cards.

01:51:45.787 --> 01:51:49.516
It was a particular triumph
that the van der Luydens...

01:51:49.624 --> 01:51:51.142
at May's request...

01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:55.564
stayed in the city to be present
at her farewell dinner...

01:51:55.755 --> 01:51:57.983
for the Countess Olenska.

01:52:00.594 --> 01:52:04.573
Archer saw all the harmless-looking
people at the table...

01:52:04.639 --> 01:52:07.867
as a band of quiet conspirators...

01:52:07.976 --> 01:52:12.080
with himself and Ellen the
center of their conspiracy.

01:52:13.482 --> 01:52:15.875
He guessed he had
been, for months...

01:52:15.984 --> 01:52:19.504
the center of countless
silently observing eyes...

01:52:19.613 --> 01:52:22.549
and patiently listening ears.

01:52:24.242 --> 01:52:26.761
He understood that, somehow...

01:52:26.828 --> 01:52:31.892
the separation between himself and the
partner of his guilt was achieved.

01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:38.106
And he knew that now the whole
tribe had rallied around his wife.

01:52:39.633 --> 01:52:44.070
He was a prisoner in the
center of an armed camp.

01:52:46.264 --> 01:52:48.950
Regina's illness doesn't
stop Beaufort...

01:52:49.059 --> 01:52:52.037
from devoting as much time
to Annie Ring as he can.

01:52:52.145 --> 01:52:53.830
Best thing for Beaufort...

01:52:53.939 --> 01:52:57.792
would be to go stay at Regina's
place in North Carolina.

01:52:57.943 --> 01:52:59.628
He could breed trotters.

01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:04.424
And the key to his release had
been returned the day before...

01:53:04.533 --> 01:53:07.594
by mail, unopened.

01:53:08.662 --> 01:53:12.515
He may stay here as a challenge
to the outrage he's created.

01:53:12.624 --> 01:53:14.851
Perhaps he'll run for office.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.313
Then will Annie Ring
be his first lady?

01:53:20.549 --> 01:53:22.984
Was your trip from
Washington tiring?

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:28.490
The heat on the train
was dreadful...

01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:32.160
but all travel has its hardships.

01:53:32.561 --> 01:53:35.080
They're worth it, just to get away.

01:53:36.898 --> 01:53:39.334
I mean to do a lot
of traveling soon.

01:53:45.407 --> 01:53:49.803
What about a little adventure, Philip?
Athens and Smyrna, maybe.

01:53:49.911 --> 01:53:52.305
- Maybe even Constantinople.
- Possibly.

01:53:52.414 --> 01:53:54.849
- Possibly.
- But not Naples.

01:53:54.916 --> 01:53:57.644
Dr. Bencomb says there's a fever.

01:53:58.253 --> 01:54:01.606
Oh, really? A fever in Naples.

01:54:02.591 --> 01:54:06.319
- There's always India.
- You need three weeks for India.

01:54:06.428 --> 01:54:07.862
Absolutely.

01:54:10.557 --> 01:54:15.745
Beaufort may not receive invitations,
but he maintains a certain position.

01:54:15.854 --> 01:54:17.163
Horizontal, I hear.

01:54:17.272 --> 01:54:19.833
If this continues, we'll
see our children...

01:54:19.941 --> 01:54:23.962
socializing with swindlers and
marrying Beaufort's bastards.

01:54:24.446 --> 01:54:26.006
Has he got any?

01:54:26.114 --> 01:54:29.426
Careful there, gentlemen.
Draw it mild.

01:54:29.534 --> 01:54:33.930
Society has a history of tolerating
vulgar women, after all.

01:54:34.039 --> 01:54:35.473
Up to a point.

01:54:38.376 --> 01:54:42.439
Have you ever noticed it's the
people with the worst cooks...

01:54:42.547 --> 01:54:46.985
who always yell about being
poisoned when they dine out.

01:54:47.385 --> 01:54:51.156
Lefferts used to be a little
more adept, I thought.

01:54:51.556 --> 01:54:54.993
But then, grace is not
always required...

01:54:55.143 --> 01:54:57.579
as long as one knows the steps.

01:55:05.737 --> 01:55:08.256
I've never heard
Lefferts so abound...

01:55:08.323 --> 01:55:11.217
in the sentiments that
adorn Christian manhood.

01:55:11.326 --> 01:55:15.388
Indignation lends a scathing eloquence
almost as effective as fear.

01:55:15.497 --> 01:55:18.308
The pressure at home
must be unrelenting.

01:55:18.416 --> 01:55:22.854
I never expected to hear such a
paean to the sanctity of the home.

01:55:25.924 --> 01:55:27.567
The silent organization...

01:55:27.676 --> 01:55:30.904
which held this whole
small world together...

01:55:31.012 --> 01:55:33.698
was determined to put
itself on record.

01:55:34.516 --> 01:55:37.118
It had never for a
moment questioned...

01:55:37.185 --> 01:55:40.080
the propriety of Madame
Olenska's conduct.

01:55:40.188 --> 01:55:43.708
It had never questioned
Archer's fidelity.

01:55:45.193 --> 01:55:49.673
And it had never heard of, suspected
or even conceived possible...

01:55:49.781 --> 01:55:52.384
anything at all to the contrary.

01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:57.806
From the seamless performance
of this ritual...

01:55:57.914 --> 01:56:02.602
Archer knew that New York believed
him to be Madame Olenska's lover.

01:56:02.711 --> 01:56:04.729
We were discussing the ball.

01:56:04.838 --> 01:56:08.400
We have it during Easter
week, to benefit the blind.

01:56:11.595 --> 01:56:14.406
And he understood for
the first time...

01:56:14.556 --> 01:56:17.242
that his wife shared the belief.

01:56:26.735 --> 01:56:29.045
You must come visit me when you do.

01:56:29.154 --> 01:56:33.049
I'll write to you when I'm settled
and let you know where I am.

01:56:33.158 --> 01:56:34.968
That would be lovely.

01:56:35.076 --> 01:56:37.429
Shall I see you to your carriage?

01:56:37.996 --> 01:56:40.307
We're driving dear Ellen home.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.268
Goodbye.

01:56:44.002 --> 01:56:45.312
Goodbye.

01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:47.522
I'll see you soon in Paris.

01:56:47.839 --> 01:56:50.275
Oh, if you and May could come.

01:56:52.093 --> 01:56:54.779
Shall we make our way
to the carriage?

01:57:06.775 --> 01:57:09.711
- Delightful evening.
- Good night.

01:57:09.861 --> 01:57:11.796
Good night, Sillerton, Larry.

01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:41.034
- It did go off beautifully, didn't it?
- Oh, yes.

01:57:43.186 --> 01:57:46.790
- May I come in and talk it over?
- Of course.

01:57:47.107 --> 01:57:50.794
- But you must be very sleepy.
- No, I'd like to be with you.

01:57:50.902 --> 01:57:52.420
Fine.

01:58:11.047 --> 01:58:13.316
If you feel up to it, May...

01:58:15.051 --> 01:58:18.154
there is something I want
to talk to you about.

01:58:18.722 --> 01:58:21.575
I tried to talk to you
the other evening.

01:58:22.225 --> 01:58:25.912
- Yes, dear, something about yourself.
- About myself, yes.

01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:29.874
It's difficult to
find the right words.

01:58:30.859 --> 01:58:35.922
It's just that I feel so
terribly tired at the moment...

01:58:37.407 --> 01:58:39.009
and I think...

01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:42.262
each day a little more so.

01:58:43.538 --> 01:58:47.434
It would be better for everyone
if I were to make a break.

01:58:49.753 --> 01:58:51.688
You mean, give up the law?

01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:58.612
Certainly that would be a
part of it, and also just...

01:58:59.888 --> 01:59:01.489
to get away.

01:59:01.598 --> 01:59:03.950
I'd like to do some traveling.

01:59:08.271 --> 01:59:10.206
To Europe or...

01:59:11.608 --> 01:59:13.710
Perhaps even farther.

01:59:15.779 --> 01:59:17.213
How far?

01:59:18.114 --> 01:59:20.467
I don't know. I thought...

01:59:21.076 --> 01:59:23.303
India or Japan.

01:59:26.581 --> 01:59:28.558
As far as that.

01:59:34.131 --> 01:59:35.315
Well...

01:59:39.594 --> 01:59:41.821
I'm afraid you can't, dear.

01:59:43.765 --> 01:59:46.243
Not unless you take me with you.

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:53.917
That is, if the doctors let
me go. I'm afraid they won't.

02:00:00.073 --> 02:00:04.594
I've been sure since this morning,
and I've been longing to tell you.

02:00:20.010 --> 02:00:21.570
Oh, my dear.

02:00:21.678 --> 02:00:23.446
You didn't guess?

02:00:25.015 --> 02:00:29.119
No. I mean, of course
I hoped but...

02:00:39.196 --> 02:00:41.715
Have you told anyone else?

02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:45.969
Only Mama and your mother...

02:00:46.453 --> 02:00:47.971
and Ellen.

02:00:51.166 --> 02:00:55.937
I told you we had a long talk,
and how wonderful she was.

02:01:04.679 --> 02:01:07.157
Did you mind my telling her?

02:01:08.725 --> 02:01:10.577
Mind? Why should I?

02:01:11.478 --> 02:01:13.914
That was two weeks ago, wasn't it?

02:01:15.816 --> 02:01:19.586
I thought you just said you
weren't sure till today.

02:01:22.823 --> 02:01:27.260
I wasn't sure then,
but I told her I was.

02:01:30.163 --> 02:01:31.598
And you see...

02:01:32.999 --> 02:01:34.517
I was right.

02:01:52.352 --> 02:01:56.831
It was the room in which
most of the real things...

02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:00.043
of his life had happened.

02:02:09.244 --> 02:02:11.263
Their eldest boy, Theodore...

02:02:11.371 --> 02:02:14.933
too delicate to be taken
to church in midwinter...

02:02:15.041 --> 02:02:17.018
was christened there.

02:02:17.127 --> 02:02:20.814
I baptize thee in the
name of the Father...

02:02:21.423 --> 02:02:23.191
and of the Son...

02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:25.527
and of the Holy Spirit.

02:02:35.562 --> 02:02:38.999
It was here that Ted
took his first steps.

02:02:39.983 --> 02:02:42.210
And here that Archer
and his wife...

02:02:42.319 --> 02:02:45.839
always discussed the future
of all their children:

02:02:46.573 --> 02:02:49.175
Bill's interest in archeology.

02:02:49.326 --> 02:02:52.762
Mary's passion for
sports and philanthropy.

02:02:53.246 --> 02:02:58.268
Ted's inclination toward art that
led to a job with an architect...

02:02:58.418 --> 02:03:01.605
as well as some
considerable redecoration.

02:03:03.715 --> 02:03:07.152
It was in this room that Mary
announced her engagement...

02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.321
I'm so happy for you.

02:03:09.429 --> 02:03:14.534
to the dullest and most reliable
of Larry Lefferts' many sons.

02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:24.920
And it was in this room too
that her father kissed her...

02:03:24.986 --> 02:03:29.382
through her wedding veil before
they had motored to Grace Church.

02:03:37.874 --> 02:03:41.978
He was a dutiful and loving
father and a faithful husband.

02:03:43.213 --> 02:03:48.026
When May died of infectious pneumonia
after nursing Bill safely through...

02:03:48.135 --> 02:03:50.570
he honestly mourned her.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.740
The world of her youth had
fallen into pieces...

02:03:53.849 --> 02:03:57.369
and rebuilt itself without
her ever noticing.

02:03:57.811 --> 02:04:01.081
This hard, bright blindness...

02:04:01.231 --> 02:04:04.334
her incapacity to
recognize change...

02:04:04.484 --> 02:04:09.506
made her children conceal their
views from her, just like Archer.

02:04:10.365 --> 02:04:13.718
She died thinking the
world a good place...

02:04:13.827 --> 02:04:18.306
full of loving and harmonious
households like her own.

02:04:19.082 --> 02:04:22.352
Newland Archer, in his 57th year...

02:04:22.502 --> 02:04:25.939
mourned his past and honored it.

02:04:29.342 --> 02:04:31.111
Yes, hello?

02:04:31.595 --> 02:04:33.530
Chicago wants you.

02:04:34.556 --> 02:04:36.408
- Dad?
- Is that you, Ted?

02:04:36.516 --> 02:04:41.246
Dad, my client wants me to look at
some gardens before I start designing.

02:04:41.354 --> 02:04:42.747
Sounds fine. Where?

02:04:42.856 --> 02:04:44.499
- Europe.
- Gracious.

02:04:44.608 --> 02:04:47.627
I'll sail next Wednesday
on the Mauretania.

02:04:48.111 --> 02:04:49.671
And miss the wedding?

02:04:49.779 --> 02:04:53.425
I'll be back on the 1st. Our
wedding's not till the 5th.

02:04:53.533 --> 02:04:56.011
I'm surprised you
remembered the date.

02:04:56.077 --> 02:04:58.763
- I was hoping you'd join me.
- What?

02:04:58.872 --> 02:05:02.142
I'll need you to remind
me of what's important.

02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.770
- Our last father-son trip.
- I appreciate the invitation...

02:05:05.879 --> 02:05:09.190
Wonderful. Can you call the
Cunard office tomorrow?

02:05:09.299 --> 02:05:11.109
I'd need to cancel my...

02:05:11.218 --> 02:05:14.738
I won't hear it. The
Atlantic is calling us.

02:05:14.971 --> 02:05:17.407
I'll be in New York on Monday.

02:05:17.516 --> 02:05:19.242
- You'll be in...?
- On Monday.

02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.119
I'll see what I can do.

02:05:21.228 --> 02:05:25.206
I can't promise anything. I'll
see what I can do, all right?

02:05:45.127 --> 02:05:48.355
I'm going to Versailles with
Tourneur. Will you come?

02:05:48.463 --> 02:05:50.273
I'm going to the Louvre.

02:05:51.007 --> 02:05:55.612
I'll meet you there later. Countess
Olenska expects us at 5:30.

02:05:56.429 --> 02:05:59.532
- What?!
- Didn't I tell you?

02:06:00.142 --> 02:06:03.119
Annie made me swear to do
three things in Paris:

02:06:03.228 --> 02:06:05.789
Get her the score of the
last Debussy songs...

02:06:05.897 --> 02:06:09.334
go to the Grand Guignol
and see Madame Olenska.

02:06:09.442 --> 02:06:13.129
She was good to Annie when
Mr. Beaufort sent her to the Sorbonne.

02:06:13.446 --> 02:06:16.424
Wasn't the countess friendly
with his first wife?

02:06:16.533 --> 02:06:18.552
Mr. Beaufort said that she was.

02:06:19.202 --> 02:06:22.347
In any case, I called the
countess this morning...

02:06:22.456 --> 02:06:27.269
- ...introduced myself as her cousin...
- Did you tell her I was here?

02:06:27.377 --> 02:06:30.105
Of course. Why not?

02:06:30.213 --> 02:06:33.316
She sounds lovely. Was she?

02:06:37.179 --> 02:06:38.572
Lovely?

02:06:41.308 --> 02:06:42.742
I don't know.

02:06:43.059 --> 02:06:44.911
She was different.

02:06:57.491 --> 02:07:00.594
Whenever he thought
of Ellen Olenska...

02:07:00.827 --> 02:07:04.055
it had been abstractly, serenely...

02:07:04.164 --> 02:07:07.934
like an imaginary loved
one in a book or picture.

02:07:12.005 --> 02:07:16.610
She had become the complete
vision of all that he had missed.

02:07:20.847 --> 02:07:23.158
I'm only 57.

02:07:28.271 --> 02:07:31.917
Did Mr. Beaufort really have a
bad time when he remarried?

02:07:32.025 --> 02:07:34.252
No one wanted to give him an inch.

02:07:34.361 --> 02:07:37.464
Perhaps because he'd
already taken so much.

02:07:38.365 --> 02:07:40.592
As if anyone remembers anymore.

02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.219
Or cares.

02:07:42.452 --> 02:07:45.597
Well, Annie Ring and he did
have a lovely daughter.

02:07:45.705 --> 02:07:47.390
You're very lucky.

02:07:47.874 --> 02:07:49.726
We're very lucky, you mean.

02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:52.646
Of course that's what I mean.

02:07:52.754 --> 02:07:56.650
Considering how that turned out
and all the time that's passed...

02:07:56.758 --> 02:07:58.485
how can you resist?

02:07:58.844 --> 02:08:01.988
I had some resistance at
first to your marriage...

02:08:02.097 --> 02:08:06.993
I mean resist seeing the woman you
almost threw everything over for.

02:08:07.936 --> 02:08:09.329
Only you didn't.

02:08:10.438 --> 02:08:11.915
I didn't?

02:08:12.858 --> 02:08:14.125
No.

02:08:15.152 --> 02:08:17.921
But Mother said she
knew we would be safe.

02:08:19.281 --> 02:08:23.218
The day before she died, she
asked to see me alone, remember?

02:08:24.619 --> 02:08:28.765
She said she knew we were safe
with you and always would be...

02:08:29.124 --> 02:08:32.686
because once when
she asked you to...

02:08:33.503 --> 02:08:36.273
you gave up the thing
that you wanted most.

02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:50.912
She never asked.

02:08:53.815 --> 02:08:55.709
She never asked me.

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:08.263
After a little while he did not
regret Ted's indiscretion.

02:09:08.371 --> 02:09:12.017
It seemed to take an iron band
from his heart to know...

02:09:12.125 --> 02:09:16.479
that after all, someone
had guessed and pitied.

02:09:17.172 --> 02:09:22.611
And that it should have been his
wife, moved him inexpressibly.

02:09:40.487 --> 02:09:43.465
The porter says it's
the third floor.

02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:47.719
Must be the one with the awnings.

02:09:50.789 --> 02:09:52.390
It's nearly 6.

02:09:54.876 --> 02:09:57.229
I think I'll just sit for a while.

02:10:00.632 --> 02:10:02.734
Do you mean you won't come?

02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:08.448
- You really won't come at all?
- I don't know.

02:10:10.475 --> 02:10:12.410
She won't understand.

02:10:13.645 --> 02:10:16.164
Go on, Ted. Maybe I'll follow you.

02:10:20.068 --> 02:10:21.461
What will I tell her?

02:10:22.571 --> 02:10:25.382
Don't you always have
something to say?

02:10:28.368 --> 02:10:31.930
I'll say you're old-fashioned
and insist on walking up...

02:10:32.038 --> 02:10:34.140
instead of taking the elevator.

02:10:42.549 --> 02:10:44.943
Just say I'm old-fashioned.

02:10:45.927 --> 02:10:49.155
That should be enough. Go on.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:51.950
Go on.
