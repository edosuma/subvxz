02:04.437 --> 02:06.575
Good evening.

02:17.881 --> 02:20.357
What is this place coming to?

02:28.356 --> 02:30.457
Damn deplorable.

02:30.458 --> 02:31.925
I know what you people are doing,

02:31.926 --> 02:34.199
bringing young girls here all hours.

02:39.932 --> 02:42.767
You know too much maybe...

02:42.768 --> 02:45.602
- Miss Four Eyes.
- Oh! I can't see!

02:45.603 --> 02:48.005
Then keep headlights off me

02:48.006 --> 02:51.309
or I put them out for good.

03:00.315 --> 03:01.452
Nyet. Nyet.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.586
Take that to the Emir.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.622
Oh.

03:08.623 --> 03:12.495
What the hell is going on?
I can't find my glasses.

03:27.439 --> 03:30.462
Lowlife imps. Panderers.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.392
Persons entering a no-go zone

03:53.393 --> 03:56.660
are reminded that there are
insufficient law enforcement personnel

03:56.661 --> 03:58.296
to maintain public safety.

03:58.297 --> 04:02.544
You are entering a no-go zone
and do so at your own risk.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.211
My name is Sawa.

04:15.211 --> 04:19.079
My father was a cop
who fought the flesh-cartels,

04:19.079 --> 04:21.884
but the Emir killed him, him and my mother.

04:22.884 --> 04:25.952
So one by one I kill them back

04:25.953 --> 04:28.654
until they lead me to the Emir.

04:28.655 --> 04:30.433
That's all I remember.

04:40.431 --> 04:42.531
- It's mine! Mine!
- It's mine!

04:42.532 --> 04:45.373
- No, stop it!
- Mine!

04:49.372 --> 04:52.011
Numbers!

05:33.909 --> 05:35.789
And I want to tell you something else.

05:35.876 --> 05:38.913
My son has got an idea to get a suit.

05:40.348 --> 05:43.082
Contaminating my crime scene, Prinsloo?

05:43.083 --> 05:46.520
Oh, jeez. You're always on my back, Aker.

05:47.519 --> 05:49.988
Looks like somebody used a land mine

05:49.989 --> 05:51.021
to clear their sinuses.

05:51.022 --> 05:52.322
Mikhail Kratsov.

05:52.323 --> 05:54.533
Third trafficker put out of work this week.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.526
Who's the coffin-dodger?

05:58.527 --> 06:00.062
Blind as a mole.

06:00.063 --> 06:05.066
She says Kratsov abducted a
Pretty Face and they went at it.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.331
No Pretty Face did that.

06:08.103 --> 06:10.629
So, what you hiding in your hand there,
Prinsloo?

06:11.973 --> 06:13.841
Exploding nine millimeter shell.

06:13.842 --> 06:18.511
Outlawed tactical weapon
issued only to security forces.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.580
Well, maybe, Lieutenant,
someone in law enforcement

06:21.581 --> 06:24.416
is getting tired of these flesh merchants

06:24.417 --> 06:26.951
buying out the cops and the courts.

06:26.952 --> 06:28.918
Like you, Prinsloo?

06:28.919 --> 06:32.554
That's called "extrajudicial
assassination."

06:32.555 --> 06:35.233
Still against the law, last I heard.

06:42.232 --> 06:44.264
Now it's all yours...

06:44.265 --> 06:46.774
just the way you like it.

07:05.418 --> 07:08.219
The Emir... my parents...

07:12.022 --> 07:14.090
The Emir...

07:14.091 --> 07:17.024
- Got to find him. I have to find him.

07:17.025 --> 07:18.795
I can't remember...

07:21.129 --> 07:22.296
I need amp.

07:22.297 --> 07:23.599
Sawa, honey.

07:24.599 --> 07:25.868
Don't forget.

07:49.554 --> 07:51.420
What took you?

07:51.421 --> 07:53.892
Ever tweezered brains out of ceiling tile?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.592
Where's my amp?

07:57.593 --> 07:59.426
I need my head cleared. I'm flashing.

07:59.427 --> 08:01.296
Your amp.

08:01.297 --> 08:02.663
That's all you could find?

08:02.664 --> 08:04.932
Two's already too many, you ask me.

08:04.933 --> 08:07.468
Look at you, shaking from withdrawal.

08:14.539 --> 08:16.774
Listen to me...

08:16.775 --> 08:20.211
before this shit kicks in
and you forget everything again.

08:20.212 --> 08:24.180
It's a nice Bolognese you made of Kratsov.

08:24.181 --> 08:25.882
Congratulations.

08:25.883 --> 08:28.450
But you left a witness.

08:28.451 --> 08:30.354
He was hurting her.

08:32.354 --> 08:34.389
Well, now they know it's a girl...

08:34.390 --> 08:37.758
with access to police weapons.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.227
If the cops know it, sooner or later

08:40.229 --> 08:42.595
some rat in that corrupt department
they call a security force

08:42.596 --> 08:44.263
sells it to the cartels.

08:44.264 --> 08:47.232
Kratsov made a call to his partner.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.868
There's a meeting in the safe
zone with the Thornhills.

08:49.869 --> 08:51.205
I wrote it down.

08:53.204 --> 08:56.140
He's trolleying for the Thornhills.

08:56.141 --> 08:59.615
They're here to buy girls put on
a shipment set up by the Emir.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.649
This is the Emir, Karl.

09:06.649 --> 09:08.786
It's what we've waited for.

09:09.786 --> 09:14.255
Look, Sawa, I want to get these
deviants as badly as you do,

09:14.256 --> 09:17.257
but I'm looking out for you like
your father would've wanted.

09:17.258 --> 09:18.258
I owe him that.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.693
I get to the Thornhills,

09:21.694 --> 09:24.197
I get inside the shipment
with the other girls,

09:24.198 --> 09:26.033
I get the Emir.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.046
So, can we do this?

09:40.044 --> 09:42.112
It's an addiction, you know.

09:42.113 --> 09:44.547
No kidding.

09:44.548 --> 09:46.081
Not the amp.

09:46.082 --> 09:49.651
The lust for revenge.

10:20.211 --> 10:22.643
A Pretty Face is asking for ya.

10:22.644 --> 10:24.155
Is she now?

10:42.963 --> 10:43.962
Help you, love?

10:55.806 --> 10:57.176
You're Vic Thornhill?

10:59.176 --> 11:01.512
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

11:02.512 --> 11:05.646
Be a good girl and remind me,
who extended this invitation?

11:05.647 --> 11:09.482
Kratsov. He said there was work.

11:09.483 --> 11:11.378
You could get me transit out of here?

11:11.818 --> 11:16.124
Today? Well, isn't that a peculiar anomaly?

11:17.124 --> 11:21.603
Last I heard, Kratsov had
shuffled off the ol' mortal coil.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.144
You all right, Jeppie?

11:43.611 --> 11:47.316
Looking fairly pensive, mate.

11:49.316 --> 11:50.716
Tell me,

11:50.717 --> 11:54.319
this young lady says she was sent
here for gainful employment.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.127
I'm wondering if perhaps
you've made her acquaintance.

12:01.127 --> 12:03.264
I've never seen her before.

12:06.264 --> 12:09.167
Well, that's moderately
perplexing, isn't it?

12:10.167 --> 12:12.167
'Cause she says she knows your partner.

12:14.836 --> 12:16.671
You Kratsov's partner?

12:16.672 --> 12:19.040
Well, allow me to rephrase that,

12:19.041 --> 12:22.208
because unless you're in business
with a bloody great pile of meat,

12:22.209 --> 12:26.145
former partner would be the proper
mot juste in this case, wouldn't it?

12:26.146 --> 12:29.550
Kratsov meets lots of girls.
He's a trolley.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.585
I can't vouch for her.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.456
You can't vouch for much, can you?

12:36.455 --> 12:41.190
We... we foray here with a great
expenditure of time and money,

12:41.191 --> 12:44.627
of which the latter you've gladly partaken.

12:44.628 --> 12:48.463
And then you tell me
someone's cocked Kratsov

12:48.464 --> 12:50.599
and you've got no talent to sell,

12:50.600 --> 12:54.970
and then this girl shows up
bandying my name about.

12:54.971 --> 12:56.772
You're useless as a codless wank,

12:57.772 --> 12:59.177
aren't you, Jeppie?

13:02.177 --> 13:04.042
Well, go on. Search her.

13:04.043 --> 13:06.052
Give me her purse.

13:13.051 --> 13:14.818
Oh.

13:14.819 --> 13:18.256
I like that. Naughty, naughty.

13:29.665 --> 13:33.508
Oh, right. You come well
equipped, don't you?

13:39.316 --> 13:41.474
I'm inclined to say we let this young lady

13:41.475 --> 13:44.444
do her dog and pony for me old man.

13:45.444 --> 13:49.516
And if he gives her the thumbs up,
then we book her.

13:51.315 --> 13:54.051
We'll at least have one girl,
then, won't we, Jeppie?

13:54.052 --> 13:56.621
I mean, one is better than none.

13:57.621 --> 14:00.589
I've just come from your competitor.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.224
Staggie. Staggie.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.859
And that rubbish he's peddling,

14:03.860 --> 14:07.431
nothing but Numbers gang skanks
straight off the street.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.432
So I will expect quality merchandise

14:11.433 --> 14:16.336
or a full refund on the advance, Jeppie.

14:16.337 --> 14:20.173
I told you, Kratsov trollies the girls.

14:20.174 --> 14:22.474
He handles the money.

14:22.475 --> 14:24.076
You find our cash

14:24.077 --> 14:28.380
or I'll shove this pen up your bloody
nasal passage into your frontal lobe.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.282
Are you gonna get me on
the shipment or not?

14:32.283 --> 14:36.386
Oh, don't worry, pet.
You'll love me old man, Clive.

14:36.387 --> 14:38.292
Much nuts, he is.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.206
Right, off to see Staggie.

16:05.693 --> 16:07.428
You all right in there, boss?

16:07.429 --> 16:09.093
Dead keen.

17:35.366 --> 17:36.998
Clive told me to bring my toys.

17:47.982 --> 17:50.245
The shipment for the Emir.
When's it go out?

17:50.246 --> 17:52.147
Who the hell are you?

17:52.148 --> 17:54.888
Where? When?

18:32.882 --> 18:36.688
Six-six. Jeppie. Staggie.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.594
Cops, stay down.

18:49.594 --> 18:52.763
Sawa, I'm not here to fight.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.697
Who are you?

18:54.698 --> 18:57.567
You know me.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.935
Oburi.

18:59.936 --> 19:01.770
I don't remember.

19:01.771 --> 19:03.938
Amp'll do that to you.

19:03.939 --> 19:05.173
Yeah? What would you know about it?

19:05.174 --> 19:09.343
Amp? It's used by security forces for PTSD.

19:09.344 --> 19:11.479
Erases emotional trauma,
makes you feel invincible.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.413
No, what would you know about me
being on it, is what I'm asking.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.452
It's a tad obvious, isn't it?

19:18.451 --> 19:21.754
Sawa, it's also a memory cleanser.

19:21.755 --> 19:25.823
- It erases your past.
- Sounds great.

19:25.824 --> 19:28.426
Look,
I get wanting to get rid of the bad stuff.

19:28.427 --> 19:29.993
What about the good stuff?

19:29.994 --> 19:32.430
Remind me what that would be.

19:33.430 --> 19:35.377
You even remember your parents' faces?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.602
I remember my parents.

19:39.603 --> 19:42.303
I remember that the Emir killed them
and that's why I'm on the amp...

19:42.304 --> 19:44.738
to make sure he never forgets it.

19:44.739 --> 19:46.240
Sawa, if you can't remember
what your parents looked like,

19:46.241 --> 19:48.775
then you've lost them a second time.

19:48.776 --> 19:51.092
Killing the Emir's not
gonna bring them back.

19:55.081 --> 19:56.722
I knew your parents.

20:01.721 --> 20:02.823
How?

20:04.822 --> 20:06.557
Get off the amp?

20:06.558 --> 20:09.161
Come find me at the old cinema.

20:10.161 --> 20:12.996
But the old cinema's Numbers territory.

20:12.997 --> 20:17.068
I get off the amp and you sell
me to the Numbers, is that it?

20:21.670 --> 20:23.537
A police action is now underway.

20:23.538 --> 20:25.640
All persons within...

20:38.351 --> 20:40.353
It erases your past.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.453
It's also a memory cleanser.

20:42.454 --> 20:43.853
You've lost them a second time.

20:43.854 --> 20:45.992
He killed them.

20:46.992 --> 20:48.544
Their faces.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.174
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget,

21:10.175 --> 21:11.847
don't forget, don't forget.

21:29.559 --> 21:32.328
Well, I guess Clive Thornhill

21:32.329 --> 21:35.863
won't be shipping any girls out
through the Emir.

21:35.864 --> 21:39.802
Not with that jack-o'-lantern
tracheotomy you cut into his neck.

21:40.802 --> 21:44.404
Remember why you went there?

21:44.405 --> 21:47.272
To get inside the transport,
to get to the Emir.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.608
I can't keep my head clear.

21:51.344 --> 21:55.945
You are going to get us both killed.

21:55.946 --> 21:59.450
I found something. A
council parking ticket.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.817
That's where Kratsov's partner came from.

22:01.818 --> 22:03.452
Jeppie?

22:03.453 --> 22:06.455
He saw you, too?

22:06.456 --> 22:09.224
I'm going there, Karl.
Before Jeppie disappears.

22:09.225 --> 22:11.126
He could still lead us to the Emir.

22:16.597 --> 22:20.132
I risked everything for you, Sawa.

22:20.133 --> 22:22.535
But now things are getting sloppy.

22:22.536 --> 22:25.704
Now you've got Vic Thornhill
and Jeppie as witnesses.

22:25.705 --> 22:29.944
You keep pushing this too far,
they're gonna trace you to me.

22:31.944 --> 22:34.645
I got into this because
your father was my partner.

22:34.646 --> 22:35.718
I know.

22:41.717 --> 22:43.522
I know.

22:46.521 --> 22:48.492
That's why we're doing this.

22:50.492 --> 22:52.125
It's for him.

22:52.126 --> 22:54.235
For both of them.

23:42.468 --> 23:43.734
Jeppie.

23:43.735 --> 23:45.036
Before Jeppie disappears.

23:45.037 --> 23:46.301
- Visit Jeppie.
- Jeppie.

23:49.374 --> 23:51.242
66.

24:01.484 --> 24:03.051
Yes?

24:03.052 --> 24:04.487
No, wait. Wrong address.

24:08.957 --> 24:11.056
Pretty Face get us in here.

24:11.057 --> 24:12.726
Thank you, Pretty Face.

24:14.694 --> 24:17.629
He say you go easy
or he be poking the eyeball out.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.830
Layla?

24:18.831 --> 24:22.636
Run! Numbers!

24:27.137 --> 24:29.278
Mommy, you're hurt!

24:51.491 --> 24:54.754
If they find you, then you'll
wish they killed you, understand?

24:55.260 --> 24:57.498
Understand?

24:59.497 --> 25:01.632
- What's your name?
- Naima.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.305
You have to go.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.615
Money girl.

26:02.882 --> 26:04.888
We take money girl.

26:14.426 --> 26:17.128
Money girl belong to us. We make deal.

26:59.196 --> 27:01.565
Picture of the Pillays' daughter.

27:02.564 --> 27:04.933
The stun grenade
we found on the ground level.

27:07.637 --> 27:10.346
- Prinsloo.
- Captain.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.444
Policeman's Family Day photo.

27:19.445 --> 27:20.680
I've got one at home,

27:20.681 --> 27:22.781
but the wife and kids in mine did a runner.

27:22.782 --> 27:24.677
Well, Missing Persons is not my beat.

27:27.252 --> 27:31.721
Yeah, I heard the lieutenant
was a cheeky chappie.

27:31.722 --> 27:34.792
Always fun to meet a cheeky chappie.

27:34.793 --> 27:39.762
Reynhook. Captain Reynhook.

27:39.763 --> 27:42.063
Intel.

27:42.064 --> 27:44.832
He was my guy, Henrick Pillay.

27:44.833 --> 27:48.302
Well, your guy was dirty,
going by the name of Jeppie,

27:48.303 --> 27:52.238
working for a trolley named Kratsov.

27:52.239 --> 27:54.840
My guy was undercover,

27:54.841 --> 27:57.743
leading Kratsov around
by the custard chucker.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.145
The money the Thornhills
were wiring for girls?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.647
Used it to fund our operation.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.883
Well,
I guess now you get to keep all the cash.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.126
Right, Reynhook?

28:14.125 --> 28:16.392
Old model police issue stun grenade.

28:16.393 --> 28:17.865
Rare, wouldn't you say?

28:21.864 --> 28:25.400
Your report cited a rare police
weapon at Kratsov's, too.

28:25.401 --> 28:26.667
Correct, sir.

28:26.668 --> 28:29.570
And the witness, the old lady
stated there was a girl present.

28:29.571 --> 28:31.237
Right.

28:31.238 --> 28:35.807
A girl who's vanished.

28:35.808 --> 28:37.641
Look,
I don't know where you're going with that,

28:37.642 --> 28:40.482
but this is obviously a Numbers killing.

28:42.482 --> 28:47.016
What would you say if I told you
that Pillay was undercover

28:47.017 --> 28:49.586
at the Thornhill crime scene?

28:49.587 --> 28:52.489
And the assailant was a girl?

28:52.490 --> 28:57.358
I'd say that would give us, oh,
about a thousand girls

28:57.359 --> 29:01.863
with motive to kill a slimeball
like Thornhill.

29:01.864 --> 29:04.731
Your partner was killed by traffickers,
too, Aker,

29:04.732 --> 29:06.031
so you know how it is.

29:06.032 --> 29:09.435
Pillay witnesses the Thornhill hit,
now he's dead.

29:09.436 --> 29:13.076
I wanna know who's behind it.
Find the girl.

29:23.248 --> 29:25.555
It's okay. It's my place.

29:31.554 --> 29:33.093
There was a kid.

29:37.092 --> 29:38.199
Her parents...

29:44.198 --> 29:45.732
Numbers screwed everything.

29:45.733 --> 29:48.233
That was brief.

29:48.234 --> 29:51.306
Little interlude of concern
you showed for the girl.

29:53.091 --> 29:54.407
What do you want from me?

29:54.607 --> 29:56.975
You forgot I told you.

29:57.975 --> 30:00.288
I knew your parents.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.611
What's wrong with you?

30:40.610 --> 30:43.079
I get it.
It's too long without the amp, right?

30:43.080 --> 30:45.514
Is that it? Need to clear your head?

30:45.515 --> 30:47.281
Every time it starts to wear off,
you get the flashes,

30:47.282 --> 30:49.552
go right back for another dose.

30:50.453 --> 30:52.452
So you won't even remember who you are.

30:52.453 --> 30:55.530
That'll be a day to look forward to.

31:01.529 --> 31:03.899
You make friends fast, Aker.

31:05.899 --> 31:08.502
They're easier to make than get rid of.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.972
Now, what's with this bullshit
about Pillay being dirty?

31:13.972 --> 31:17.287
Even I know Intel had a guy on the
inside using the name Jeppie.

31:21.512 --> 31:24.925
It's good to know you read
those Intel memos, Prinsloo.

31:41.628 --> 31:44.196
The Emir, he killed them. My parents.

31:45.431 --> 31:47.331
...going to get us both killed.

31:47.332 --> 31:50.414
- I need amp.
- Your amp.

32:03.412 --> 32:06.675
Listen, if you want to help her,
I know where to find the girl.

32:07.248 --> 32:10.950
Look, I don't need you
to do anything, okay?

32:10.951 --> 32:12.657
All right.

32:15.656 --> 32:17.556
You know, it's ironic, isn't it?

32:17.557 --> 32:20.821
You doing what you're doing 'cause
someone killed your parents.

32:21.593 --> 32:23.879
'Cause of you, that girl just lost hers.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.519
Wait.

33:18.573 --> 33:20.785
What did you do?

33:36.888 --> 33:38.222
How do we find the girl?

33:38.223 --> 33:40.357
I have absolutely no idea.

33:40.358 --> 33:41.925
You don't know where we're going?

33:41.926 --> 33:45.464
Yeah, I guess I missed the guided tour?

33:47.438 --> 33:50.333
What, I would've thought you'd
be used to walking around

33:50.334 --> 33:52.402
in a bit of a fog by now.

33:53.192 --> 33:55.403
- Watch it.
- Someone's a bit cranky today,

33:55.404 --> 33:58.719
Let's just find the girl so you
can hurry home and get amped up.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.333
I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I'm gonna get you out of there.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.126
No, no, no, we're here to help
and lead you out of here.

34:33.694 --> 34:36.904
We're looking for another little girl.
She's 10, 11 years old.

34:36.905 --> 34:40.143
Naima. Her name is Naima.

34:41.141 --> 34:42.141
Upstairs?

34:43.496 --> 34:45.445
Right here. We're gonna be right back.

34:45.446 --> 34:47.235
Now, don't you move. We'll be back.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.727
You okay?

35:04.728 --> 35:06.781
Let's get the girls and get out of here.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.933
Naima?

35:10.932 --> 35:12.070
- Come on.
- Come on.

35:16.103 --> 35:18.671
- Yo, chummy.
- Take the girls.

35:18.672 --> 35:20.341
Get behind me.

35:21.341 --> 35:23.409
The littles be promised to Staggie.

35:23.410 --> 35:26.044
You want one, you cash with him.

35:26.045 --> 35:28.613
- Who is Staggie?
- Staggie Steyns.

35:28.614 --> 35:30.247
Tell you what?

35:30.248 --> 35:34.385
You come back later.
They got one eye, he cash you cheap.

35:34.386 --> 35:36.253
What do you mean one eye?

35:36.254 --> 35:38.520
Just like Staggie.

35:38.521 --> 35:40.100
He make them look like he got.

35:51.867 --> 35:52.867
Sawa!

35:56.737 --> 35:58.738
No more Pretty Face?

35:58.739 --> 36:02.151
We're out of time, Sawa.

36:12.751 --> 36:13.892
Oh, jeez.

36:21.890 --> 36:24.361
Okay, come on. Come on. Sawa!

36:26.361 --> 36:27.628
Sawa.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.973
Staggie.

36:39.972 --> 36:41.640
Where do I find Staggie?

36:41.641 --> 36:46.310
Go to Fun Huis.
Staggie, he find you, Pretty Face.

37:22.275 --> 37:24.049
Late for class?

37:51.363 --> 37:53.102
So, you knew my parents?

37:56.102 --> 37:57.704
So, what, we knew each other?

37:58.704 --> 38:00.872
You were totally into me.

38:00.873 --> 38:03.030
Don't even.

38:26.026 --> 38:28.027
- Thanks for the joyride.
- Sawa!

38:43.975 --> 38:46.409
Stop.

38:46.410 --> 38:48.078
Zoom in.

38:51.447 --> 38:52.859
Closer.

39:04.857 --> 39:07.805
Give me the disk.
I'll run it through facial recognition.

39:11.597 --> 39:12.684
Thanks.

40:04.675 --> 40:05.674
Fun house.

40:06.509 --> 40:07.608
...go to Fun Huis.

40:07.609 --> 40:08.709
Staggie.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.379
Staggie Steyns. Staggie.

40:34.731 --> 40:36.401
Hello. Hi.

40:38.401 --> 40:40.204
Hey.

42:04.072 --> 42:05.072
No, that's...

42:20.018 --> 42:22.229
You know, if the Thornhills want quality...

42:23.020 --> 42:25.257
...give them quality.

42:26.256 --> 42:28.492
We don't pimp no Numbers trash.

42:29.859 --> 42:31.964
We've come up in the world, like Kratsov.

42:33.563 --> 42:37.697
You wanna go downstairs,
kidnap some s-s-skirt,

42:37.698 --> 42:40.268
and get s-s-snuffed like Kratsov?

42:40.269 --> 42:43.270
For what? Plenty of
little chickens out there

42:43.271 --> 42:46.205
we can get for a handful of f-f-feed.

42:46.206 --> 42:49.275
See, that's why I run this operation.

42:49.276 --> 42:52.346
You don't know nothing about retail markup.

42:53.345 --> 42:55.351
And you do.

42:59.350 --> 43:00.983
Sorry, my bad.

43:00.984 --> 43:03.094
Get out.

43:23.237 --> 43:24.610
Oh, damn it.

43:29.609 --> 43:30.678
You Staggie Steyns?

43:32.677 --> 43:35.680
No, he's Staggie Steyns.

43:35.681 --> 43:37.647
What?

43:37.648 --> 43:41.517
No, I'm S-S-S-Sascha.

43:41.518 --> 43:44.353
I'm Sascha.

43:44.354 --> 43:45.889
Tell the truth, bro.

43:50.859 --> 43:52.529
D-d-d-do it.

43:53.529 --> 43:55.365
Do it!

44:01.634 --> 44:03.904
I know who you are.

44:04.904 --> 44:06.705
Tell me about the Emir's shipment.

44:23.186 --> 44:25.419
Get me the hell out of here! Move it!

44:25.420 --> 44:27.823
- Boss, let's go!
- Stay here!

44:27.824 --> 44:32.341
Get me out.
I want her head in a sandwich bag.

44:59.316 --> 45:01.019
No wallet.

45:27.104 --> 45:29.207
We were interrupted.

45:29.208 --> 45:31.941
Oh, yeah.

45:31.942 --> 45:34.311
You want to know about the Emir's shipment.

45:34.312 --> 45:36.078
No problem.

45:36.079 --> 45:39.949
Tomorrow night, four girls,

45:39.950 --> 45:42.050
main container yard.

45:42.051 --> 45:45.253
But, hey, you want in?

45:45.254 --> 45:46.786
Let Daddy arrange it for you.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.457
- What time?
- Okay, okay.

45:50.457 --> 45:51.757
10:00.

45:51.758 --> 45:54.362
How are they coming in?

45:55.362 --> 45:56.672
Meat truck.

47:13.725 --> 47:15.793
Three officers need emergency assistance

47:15.794 --> 47:18.895
northbound on quadrant three flyover.

47:18.896 --> 47:21.898
All units in the vicinity are
asked to respond immediately.

47:21.899 --> 47:23.733
Shots are being fired.

47:23.734 --> 47:25.101
Yo, cheeky prawn.

47:25.102 --> 47:27.770
You got something what belong to us.

47:27.771 --> 47:31.040
We want it back? Or we clap you one.

47:31.041 --> 47:32.641
Happy to return it.

47:32.642 --> 47:36.645
I'm not talking about no ball, doffhead.

47:37.645 --> 47:40.447
Money girl.

47:40.448 --> 47:42.785
She be promised to us.

47:46.886 --> 47:48.589
Get him!

48:24.850 --> 48:26.852
...is now underway.

48:26.853 --> 48:29.619
All persons within the vicinity
of this address

48:29.620 --> 48:31.889
are advised to seek immediate shelter.

48:31.890 --> 48:34.192
Anyone remaining at the scene
will be arrested...

48:34.392 --> 48:37.426
Aker... I've seen the evidence inside.

48:37.427 --> 48:40.111
They're analyzing the girl's
clothes and the shells.

48:41.397 --> 48:44.568
It looks like the same weapon
that was used to kill Kratsov.

52:26.850 --> 52:29.220
He killed them.

52:31.219 --> 52:33.092
Get on the shipment.

52:37.091 --> 52:39.279
Container yard.

53:04.948 --> 53:06.748
You're late.

53:06.749 --> 53:09.431
- Not my fault.
- Stay on schedule.

53:24.130 --> 53:25.703
Wake up.

53:30.703 --> 53:32.469
Get up.

53:32.470 --> 53:34.638
Get up.

53:34.639 --> 53:35.978
Move it.

53:40.977 --> 53:42.880
Hey, hey.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.624
Hey!

54:02.929 --> 54:05.231
Let me see what's going on in there.

54:13.536 --> 54:14.940
What are you doing here?

54:16.939 --> 54:18.540
Got her, Doc.

54:23.311 --> 54:24.581
Freeze.

54:26.581 --> 54:28.587
- Hey, drop it!
- Put it down!

55:16.423 --> 55:18.528
You've been looking for me, I understand.

55:25.429 --> 55:30.303
Difficult to slip in as a girl
when the cargo consists of boys.

55:34.302 --> 55:37.206
A bit of misinformation here and there...

55:38.206 --> 55:40.913
...leads to some interesting results.

55:44.913 --> 55:47.079
Doesn't it?

55:47.080 --> 55:49.053
Miss...

55:53.052 --> 55:54.218
Sawa.

55:54.219 --> 55:55.889
Sawa.

55:56.888 --> 55:58.995
Such an unusual name.

56:04.994 --> 56:06.000
My father...

56:09.999 --> 56:10.999
Sawa.

56:12.569 --> 56:15.884
My father said that it meant the
sound that you couldn't hold...

56:18.173 --> 56:20.067
...and the feather blown by the wind.

56:21.442 --> 56:22.948
A poet.

56:27.947 --> 56:29.981
A cop.

56:29.982 --> 56:33.987
An unfortunate occupation
in this part of the world.

56:34.987 --> 56:37.256
Well, you would know.

56:39.256 --> 56:40.794
You killed him.

56:42.793 --> 56:45.060
Emir.

56:45.061 --> 56:48.097
And you killed Clive Thornhill, Miss Sawa.

56:49.097 --> 56:52.767
Among many of my other clients,
it would seem.

56:52.768 --> 56:56.002
You talk about them like
they're businessmen.

56:56.003 --> 56:58.573
Oh, but they are.

57:00.573 --> 57:03.442
Who do you suppose buys children, the poor?

57:03.443 --> 57:04.579
No.

57:06.579 --> 57:09.015
It is business, Miss Sawa.

57:10.015 --> 57:13.450
And I control that business
by sitting at the choke hold

57:13.451 --> 57:17.157
of what gets out of this
godforsaken ruin of a country.

57:19.157 --> 57:23.127
Mr. Thornhill.

57:25.127 --> 57:27.311
Is this the young lady you're seeking?

57:49.314 --> 57:50.648
Shamil.

57:50.649 --> 57:54.683
- Come here, you...
- You'll have your turn, Mr. Thornhill.

57:54.684 --> 57:58.687
But first she needs to talk.

57:58.688 --> 58:02.229
Oh, I'll make her bloody squeal.

58:06.228 --> 58:07.996
Shamil.

58:16.802 --> 58:18.372
Do you see this, Miss Sawa?

58:20.372 --> 58:24.511
Russian soldiers dragged me
into a local shop in Chechnya...

58:25.511 --> 58:28.247
...and deep-fried my hand.

58:30.247 --> 58:32.549
They then chopped it into little bits

58:32.550 --> 58:36.519
and made everyone in the
village eat a piece

58:36.520 --> 58:38.823
for having given me shelter.

58:40.823 --> 58:43.525
An effective method to get people to talk,

58:43.526 --> 58:44.525
I can assure you.

58:51.297 --> 58:53.535
Now is there something you want to tell us?

58:55.534 --> 58:58.703
Like the name of your employer, perhaps?

58:58.704 --> 59:00.272
The person behind the killings

59:00.273 --> 59:03.810
that's been disrupting
my business for years.

59:04.810 --> 59:06.412
I'd like to tell you...

59:08.412 --> 59:10.883
...I'm gonna take my earring back.

59:12.882 --> 59:14.988
And then I'm gonna kill every one of you.

59:17.887 --> 59:19.887
Oh, skip the bleeding hors d'oeuvres,

59:19.888 --> 59:21.415
shall we, and get on with it.

59:44.408 --> 59:47.445
I don't give fuck-all square
about your hand, love.

59:59.988 --> 01:00:02.191
I've known many policemen, Miss Sawa.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:06.496
Most, once they were paid,
we found to be reasonable.

01:00:08.093 --> 01:00:11.864
Perhaps your father,
whom I honestly do not recall,

01:00:11.865 --> 01:00:13.900
was unreasonable.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.006
Do you really wish
to follow that same course?

01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:24.343
It's genetic, I guess.

01:01:11.312 --> 01:01:12.785
Oi!

01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:23.990
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on here?

01:03:16.749 --> 01:03:18.550
Mommy!

01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:16.597
You can both testify he removed evidence?

01:04:16.598 --> 01:04:18.532
Yes, Captain.

01:04:18.533 --> 01:04:21.400
I told you,
he's been protecting someone for years.

01:04:21.401 --> 01:04:23.720
Then let's find out who the girl is.

01:04:50.893 --> 01:04:52.560
Hey.

01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:54.531
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

01:04:56.531 --> 01:04:58.331
It's just withdrawals.

01:04:58.332 --> 01:04:59.595
The man who shot them...

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:06.073
I saw his face.

01:05:07.073 --> 01:05:09.108
It was burned.

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:11.109
You're sick.

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.795
You've been off the amp for days.

01:05:15.347 --> 01:05:17.015
Here.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:19.520
I found you one.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.494
No, no. I remember now.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.927
It wasn't the Emir.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.828
It was the Emir and the Emir's dead.

01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:37.367
You can't trust your own mind right now,
Sawa.

01:05:39.366 --> 01:05:40.934
He's still out there, Karl.

01:05:40.935 --> 01:05:44.168
The man you're remembering

01:05:44.169 --> 01:05:45.372
is just a gunman.

01:05:47.372 --> 01:05:48.743
I need to know, Karl.

01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:54.645
Listen...

01:05:57.214 --> 01:06:00.882
the cops, I'm... I'm worried.

01:06:00.883 --> 01:06:03.822
I've had to clean up too much.

01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:08.555
We need to find him, Karl.

01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:10.724
Look, I need to move you.

01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:13.694
We've run out of rope, do you understand?

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:16.529
What difference does it make?

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.331
We won!

01:06:18.332 --> 01:06:21.367
The man who caused all this is dead.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:24.872
Now take the amp so we can get out of here.

01:06:26.872 --> 01:06:29.506
I can't, Karl.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:31.380
I can't lose them a second time.

01:06:36.379 --> 01:06:38.614
The boy?

01:06:38.615 --> 01:06:40.951
With the hood?

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.084
There's a surveillance tape.

01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:45.353
Don't worry,
I destroyed it like everything else,

01:06:45.354 --> 01:06:47.565
but if you want to know about the gunman...

01:06:50.392 --> 01:06:52.864
...he can tell you.

01:06:56.863 --> 01:06:58.502
- What do you mean?
- Ask him!

01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:07.616
I can't do this anymore.

01:07:19.614 --> 01:07:21.350
Karl?

01:07:23.918 --> 01:07:26.119
Karl!

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.093
Karl!

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:08.587
The man who killed my parents.

01:08:08.588 --> 01:08:10.356
How do you know who he is?

01:08:10.357 --> 01:08:12.958
Is that what Aker told you?

01:08:13.928 --> 01:08:15.826
Look, I'm not talking to you.
He's got you back on the amp.

01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:17.459
You'll forget everything I say.

01:08:19.398 --> 01:08:20.397
I'm going clean.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.167
I want to remember.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:25.167
Oh, you want the whole story? Let's go?

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.703
Right, of course. Why have a conversation

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:30.073
when you can stab someone?

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.758
That's what you think, isn't it?

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:37.647
We were friends, Sawa.

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.616
You and me.

01:08:41.616 --> 01:08:43.670
We were friends.

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:04.877
This is as far as I go.

01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:10.837
No, you're not locking me in some hole.

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.299
I'm not going in there.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.470
I can't.

01:09:48.071 --> 01:09:50.237
You can stick me with your little
girly knife, if you want to.

01:09:50.238 --> 01:09:51.742
I'm not going in there.

01:09:54.742 --> 01:09:58.094
You keep saying that,
you'll take all the fun out of the idea.

01:10:46.552 --> 01:10:47.821
Please.

01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:52.455
The gun on the table is for you.

01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:53.494
I knew you.

01:10:56.494 --> 01:10:59.062
Your father was a...

01:11:00.062 --> 01:11:02.801
...friend and a colleague.

01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:08.434
This is who I was.

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:13.443
Officer Breedlove. Otis Breedlove.

01:11:16.442 --> 01:11:17.600
That was before the...

01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:21.546
...sulfur mustard.

01:11:21.547 --> 01:11:23.717
A blister agent.

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.318
I don't understand.

01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:30.652
That's the point.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:34.022
A person with no sense of
history isn't a person.

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:36.026
Just another...

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.500
...number in the body count.

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:45.600
When the banks failed
and the government collapsed,

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:49.469
state weaponry of every
description disappeared,

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:51.805
sold to whoever paid
the highest price for it.

01:11:51.806 --> 01:11:53.505
What are you talking about?

01:11:53.506 --> 01:11:56.744
About what happened to your
mother and your father, to you.

01:11:58.743 --> 01:12:00.146
You killed my parents.

01:12:01.146 --> 01:12:02.849
No.

01:12:03.848 --> 01:12:07.018
But I bear responsibility for their deaths.

01:12:07.887 --> 01:12:09.886
Weapons were being stolen from our unit

01:12:09.887 --> 01:12:12.521
and I had discovered who was doing it.

01:12:12.522 --> 01:12:17.224
I was going to report it
and then my house was bombed,

01:12:17.225 --> 01:12:20.693
my wife killed, and if I didn't keep quiet,

01:12:20.694 --> 01:12:23.296
my son would be harmed, and so...

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:27.834
I-I-I had to admit

01:12:27.835 --> 01:12:31.505
that there was someone else in
our unit who knew what I knew.

01:12:32.504 --> 01:12:35.045
Someone in the unit.

01:12:40.044 --> 01:12:41.452
My father?

01:12:47.451 --> 01:12:49.857
Yes, I identified your father.

01:12:53.857 --> 01:12:55.526
But I didn't shoot him.

01:12:57.526 --> 01:13:00.394
My boy was used to ring the bell.

01:13:00.395 --> 01:13:02.629
- I was forced inside.
- Mommy!

01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:08.800
All of this, your whole life,

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:13.237
it's all been about erasing
one man's transgression.

01:13:13.238 --> 01:13:16.606
The man who took your memory from you

01:13:16.607 --> 01:13:20.410
and replaced it with a past he created

01:13:20.411 --> 01:13:24.985
to get you to do whatever he wanted.

01:13:28.984 --> 01:13:30.426
Get to work.

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.014
It was you.

01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:04.885
You rang the bell.

01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:11.625
He's your father.

01:14:15.624 --> 01:14:17.995
He's dying.

01:14:20.994 --> 01:14:24.415
He wanted us both to know the truth.
That's why I had to find you.

01:14:30.201 --> 01:14:33.908
- Sawa, what we did...
- No, you didn't do anything.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.010
You were a child.

01:14:40.011 --> 01:14:43.212
We both were.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.783
Quick.

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.559
Sawa, Oburi, come.

01:14:59.558 --> 01:15:02.601
Sawa, disarm the bag.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.702
Yo, chummy.

01:15:10.702 --> 01:15:12.610
Mag, too, Pretty Face.

01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:26.048
Dart filled with amp.

01:15:32.352 --> 01:15:35.957
This is not amp.

01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:39.558
You remember Mandla and Margrit, right?

01:15:39.559 --> 01:15:42.626
Unsavory company, I agree.

01:15:42.627 --> 01:15:44.461
But I had to do something about Pillay.

01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:47.298
He was a cop.

01:15:47.299 --> 01:15:49.867
If he'd ID'd her, it
could've led them to me.

01:15:50.867 --> 01:15:54.804
This could've been all over,

01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:58.945
but your father had to go
and crawl up out of the grave.

01:16:03.945 --> 01:16:06.586
Still making problems, hey?

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.985
- Open the door.
- It's unlocked.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:14.352
You can open it yourself, mate.

01:16:14.353 --> 01:16:16.621
Mandla.

01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:28.868
No!

01:16:36.706 --> 01:16:39.508
Otis, my man.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.877
Your sentimental attachment
to that old-school weapon

01:16:42.878 --> 01:16:44.778
limits you to just two shots.

01:16:44.779 --> 01:16:48.557
Yes, but it's the only
shot I've ever wanted.

01:16:57.555 --> 01:16:59.189
Stop, Sawa.

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.792
Or I'll cut him down.

01:17:01.793 --> 01:17:03.964
Yeah, you're good at that, it seems.

01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:13.672
Your father was gonna rat me out.

01:17:16.672 --> 01:17:21.341
Yes, I stole the weapons. Yes, I sold them.

01:17:21.342 --> 01:17:24.613
Everybody in state security was doing that.

01:17:28.681 --> 01:17:31.187
I made a mistake.

01:17:34.186 --> 01:17:38.824
But I spent the rest of my life
paying it back.

01:17:39.823 --> 01:17:42.826
Cleaning up the streets when the cops,
the courts,

01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:46.297
and everybody else was too
weak to do anything about it.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:52.700
I spent those years trying to bring justice

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:55.203
to the man responsible.

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.573
Karl, you're the man responsible.

01:18:01.842 --> 01:18:03.378
Yeah, you're right.

01:18:05.378 --> 01:18:07.746
I betcha it did sound good,
though, didn't it?

01:18:12.117 --> 01:18:14.218
I coulda killed you, Sawa,

01:18:14.219 --> 01:18:16.219
or sold you.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.924
Or left you in the streets
for the Numbers to pick over.

01:18:20.924 --> 01:18:22.928
But I took care of you.

01:18:23.928 --> 01:18:28.034
I owed that to your father.

01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:34.301
Since he's not around to return the favor,

01:18:34.302 --> 01:18:35.805
I'm gonna do it for him.

01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:40.478
Sawa...

01:19:17.471 --> 01:19:20.594
Dad? You all right?

01:20:33.766 --> 01:20:35.404
Look at you.

01:20:39.971 --> 01:20:42.443
I made a monster.

01:20:44.442 --> 01:20:48.482
A beautiful monster.

01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:52.481
Come.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:04.558
Nobody... could've infiltrated...

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.497
a flesh-cartel but you.

01:21:11.497 --> 01:21:16.771
Together, we could have
all of this tomorrow.

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:22.276
Without the Emir, it's all ours.

01:21:37.052 --> 01:21:38.857
Finally, Karl...

01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:44.989
Something comes out of your
mouth that isn't a lie.

01:22:27.559 --> 01:22:29.594
How much amp do you suppose that is?

01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:31.328
I don't know, Captain,

01:22:31.329 --> 01:22:32.929
but I'm guessing you'll have a hard time

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.295
getting the name of the
girl out of him now.
