WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.552
<i>And Thorsten, just so you know,</i>

00:10.635 --> 00:13.263
<i>because it created
some controversy this morning,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.474
NASA is talking about
swapping Drew and Luca,

00:17.058 --> 00:19.936
so that Drew is EV1 and Luca is EV2.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.896
<i>Yeah?</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:27.277
Just... And this is primarily to get Drew
some more prime EVA time.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.696
<i>Yeah?</i>
- If something goes really bad,

00:29.863 --> 00:31.656
like, "Oh, my God, we need a jumper..."

00:33.116 --> 00:36.244
<i>I'm sure Luca is going
to switch back to EV1.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:39.831
<i>This is the timeline from Optimus.
This is how we schedule it.</i>

00:39.956 --> 00:42.125
As you can see here,
it says ISS Commander.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.003
That's Luca.
These guys are probably going to switch.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.089
This will probably be Drew,
and this will be Luca.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.556
Sure.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.310
No, it's...

01:04.522 --> 01:05.523
It'll be fine.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.819
- I'm very confident, but I...

01:12.739 --> 01:14.991
It's also crew training
as well, 'cause...

02:03.540 --> 02:08.128
They have so far exceeded
anyone's expectations...

02:10.630 --> 02:12.132
Given what Drew has done,

02:12.507 --> 02:15.510
I have no doubt
that this is going to go just fine.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.720
Drew has been remarkable.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.181
<i>These astronauts are really good.</i>

02:20.723 --> 02:24.269
<i>These guys,
they're both very, very qualified.</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:26.396
<i>We knew that either one could do it.</i>

02:28.064 --> 02:32.443
<i>But this is it.
You know, if it doesn't work now,</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:34.946
we just wasted the last four years.

02:35.363 --> 02:40.326
So... But it's gonna work.
One way or another, it's gonna work.

03:07.312 --> 03:11.524
I want my eggs.
Look at you.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.527
<i>Over the holiday break,
Peggy and I got married.</i>

03:15.778 --> 03:18.031
<i>It was just perfect.</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:26.039
<i>I'm now at the time of my life
where I realized</i>

03:26.122 --> 03:29.459
<i>it's really about people
and who you do stuff with.</i>

03:30.752 --> 03:33.004
<i>She's an amazing partner.</i>

03:33.963 --> 03:37.508
<i>And it's just really cool
to share a life with her.</i>

03:39.969 --> 03:41.471
<i>Yeah, she's pretty special.</i>

03:58.738 --> 04:01.324
Packing for a two-week trip to Japan.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.371
Got my trusty NASA orange shoes...

04:08.456 --> 04:10.375
a book to read on the plane.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.837
Yeah, two weeks in Japan,
final preparations there

04:15.088 --> 04:18.466
on the Japanese systems,
and some Japanese experiments.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.970
And then that's it.
And I come back here

04:22.053 --> 04:27.141
for just a couple days and head out
to Russia for all the pre-flight stuff.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.473
<i>What I really like about
the space program</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:09.309
<i>is the international nature of it.</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:14.605
<i>There's folks in Germany, and Italy,
and America, and Russia,</i>

05:14.689 --> 05:16.399
<i>and Canada and Japan.</i>

05:16.899 --> 05:20.194
<i>The international partnership
is an amazing achievement.</i>

05:26.617 --> 05:32.749
<i>Point of being here in Japan is to train
on the Japanese systems, equipment,</i>

05:32.832 --> 05:36.794
<i>and experiments that we'll be conducting
on the Space Station.</i>

05:41.174 --> 05:43.926
And the back up only button is depressed.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.388
<i>NASA don't have a lot
of the high-fidelity harbor</i>

05:47.472 --> 05:48.723
<i>that they have here.</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:50.808
Latching handle button push.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.062
<i>So, it's really cool to be here
and manipulate switches,</i>

05:54.312 --> 05:56.606
<i>and see motors drive and equipment go.</i>

05:56.731 --> 06:00.026
Oh, wow. It's going to stop
against the door.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.994
<i>So, the real purpose of our time
on board the Space Station</i>

06:10.119 --> 06:12.663
is to conduct science and research.

06:12.914 --> 06:17.001
<i>And it'll just be me on the US side
of the Space Station</i>

06:17.168 --> 06:21.672
<i>until a commercial vehicle arrives,
so that will be a little harder</i>

06:21.756 --> 06:26.135
with one person because with four people,
you can get four times the amount of work.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.513
Cassidy-san, are you ready
to perform the experiment?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.527
- Very nice to meet all of you.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.570
Nice to meet you.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.712
What we're used to right now today
with four crew members and getting lots

07:01.838 --> 07:05.591
of science and having plenty
of available manpower,

07:06.509 --> 07:08.511
we won't have that luxury.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.721
It's exciting, though.
- Yeah, it's very exciting.

07:13.891 --> 07:18.604
In English, there's a saying that says,
"We put ten pounds of things

07:18.688 --> 07:22.150
-"into a five-pound basket."

07:22.400 --> 07:24.819
You know this? Yes. But...

07:27.447 --> 07:28.698
Yeah.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.032
<i>It will be really tough,</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:34.704
but I'm ready mentally to be
the only one up there on the US side.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.839
- US space rice is terrible.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.716
It is so bad.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.969
How do you say dumpling?
What is it called?

07:50.052 --> 07:51.429
<i>Gyoza.
- Yoza?</i>

07:51.554 --> 07:57.935
<i>The technical stuff is very useful,
but it's the personal connections</i>

07:58.019 --> 08:00.354
<i>with the people that matters the most
because when you're up there,</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:02.940
and you're working,
and a bolt doesn't work,

08:03.024 --> 08:05.026
and you call down on the radio
and say, "Hey!"

08:05.318 --> 08:07.278
<i>And you recognize a familiar voice.</i>

08:08.362 --> 08:10.615
<i>And so, it's things like that
that is very important.</i>

08:15.077 --> 08:16.078
It's a coin.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.247
You can see the EVA guy.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.791
The helmet and the helmet.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.003
Expedition 63.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.492
Yeah, he's special.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.373
- More, more.
- More, more.

09:00.665 --> 09:04.210
<i>I realized a long time ago
that just by putting this blue outfit on,</i>

09:04.669 --> 09:08.047
<i>you suddenly have the power
to be a positive influence.</i>

09:17.056 --> 09:18.182
<i>I think about that a lot.</i>

09:22.478 --> 09:25.815
Being an astronaut, each different phase,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.693
there's maybe a different answer
of why you do it.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.780
<i>There'll be a time when there will be
people living on other planets.</i>

09:36.325 --> 09:37.368
<i>And it's the work.</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:41.497
<i>The hard work
that we're doing right now at NASA,</i>

09:41.581 --> 09:43.207
<i>and within the larger community,</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.543
<i>they're setting the stage,
for that to happen.</i>

10:01.100 --> 10:05.646
And we have
the guitar making an appearance. Yes.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.278
Could be worse. Music country.

10:13.237 --> 10:17.825
And, your friend. Me.

10:21.787 --> 10:26.334
The last three EVAS,
everything went exactly as planned.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.085
And in some cases, better.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.713
That's so good.
- This one's for Alexei.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.299
<i>You know at this point, as a crew...</i>

10:35.426 --> 10:37.720
<i>we were very confident.
We're a well-oiled machine,</i>

10:37.803 --> 10:38.929
<i>all working together.</i>

10:40.723 --> 10:41.974
<i>We had this down.</i>

10:43.809 --> 10:46.812
<i>But the suggestion came
from the ground team actually.</i>

10:46.937 --> 10:50.691
It was like, "Hey, for this last one,
let's have them swap roles."

10:52.443 --> 10:54.278
<i>And we thought,
"Hey, this is a great idea.</i>

10:54.362 --> 10:56.405
<i>"This is going to keep us on our toes.</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:59.200
<i>"We're so in this rhythm right now.
This is going to help us</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:00.743
<i>"stave off complacency."</i>

11:05.665 --> 11:10.628
<i>I was going to be
the guy on the final EVA</i>

11:10.711 --> 11:12.797
<i>that was going
to be making a lot of the calls.</i>

11:13.172 --> 11:17.051
<i>You know, and I was going to be putting
the bow on this entire series.</i>

11:18.344 --> 11:22.223
And so, you do carry
a significant amount of responsibility.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.199
Go for EVA.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.326
- Whoo!
- Bring it on.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.960
<i>We expect AMS
to give tremendous science.</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:53.212
<i>Really groundbreaking.</i>

11:54.171 --> 11:58.592
<i>But the AMS story,
it's a story of the people.</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:00.219
<i>Keep moving forward.</i>

12:01.095 --> 12:05.725
<i>Because the science goes on,
but the legacy of this cooperation</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:08.310
<i>is what, one day, will change the world.</i>

12:24.994 --> 12:27.955
<i>This is
the final spacewalk for AMS repair.</i>

12:28.706 --> 12:33.711
<i>Big day, big moment.
And they're out there to see</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
if there's any leaks
and then reactivate the system

12:36.213 --> 12:38.841
after they confirmed
there's no leaks, and...

12:38.966 --> 12:40.718
<i>Drew and Luca, I'm excited for them.</i>

12:41.677 --> 12:44.138
<i>Those guys are great,
and they're going to do awesome.</i>

12:45.139 --> 12:46.140
Thank you.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.067
I'm going the wrong way.
I've got to go up this door here.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.237
See, I'm so confused
by all this now.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.114
<i>This is it.</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:03.574
This is the last one.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.035
They're going to go out there,
and do the leak checks.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.996
<i>And the bottom line is we're ready to go.</i>

13:10.039 --> 13:13.918
Yeah, this has been over four years
of getting ready for this moment,

13:14.001 --> 13:18.506
and we're thrilled to have it
about ready to run again.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.637
<i>Everything worked
so flawlessly on the first EVA.</i>

13:24.720 --> 13:29.517
<i>And then get that shield off.
We managed to get all the AAFs swaged.</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:32.728
<i>Now, and the big milestone
is just the leaks.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:36.899
<i>If we don't have leaks,
if all of those AAFs worked,</i>

13:37.525 --> 13:39.276
<i>we're in known territory.</i>

13:41.946 --> 13:44.240
<i>When you're
responsible for a single event</i>

13:44.323 --> 13:45.366
<i>or for a single mission,</i>

13:45.908 --> 13:48.410
<i>you're really focused entirely
on that one thing.</i>

13:48.911 --> 13:52.206
<i>So, we've decided what we're going to do.
We've decided what those priorities are.</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:54.041
If everything goes perfectly,

13:54.124 --> 13:55.626
you shouldn't have to make
any decisions at all.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.009
<i>Houston airlock on one</i>

14:04.134 --> 14:07.555
<i>for serial numbers in step 18.</i>

14:08.055 --> 14:10.432
<i>Drew Morgan will be
the first out of the hatch this morning</i>

14:10.558 --> 14:13.769
<i>followed by Luca Parmitano.
Again, Morgan as EV1</i>

14:13.936 --> 14:17.189
<i>in the suit-bearing the red stripes.
And Parmitano, EV2,</i>

14:17.439 --> 14:19.024
<i>in the suit bearing no stripes.</i>

14:19.900 --> 14:24.446
Luca and Drew, they switched.
Drew is the main EV.

14:25.447 --> 14:29.535
- Luca is EV? Or...
- Luca is EV2, this time.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.704
Drew is lead.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.929
<i>These are the times where
you have to kind of grab hold of yourself,</i>

14:49.013 --> 14:51.974
<i>and remind yourself that,
"Hey, this is not, you know,</i>

14:52.099 --> 14:53.517
<i>"downhill to the finish line.</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:55.769
"This is...
We are still in the vacuum of space.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.230
"There are two lives
hanging in the balance still.

14:58.355 --> 15:03.235
<i>"We got to stay absolutely focused."
Even though I'm excited for the end,</i>

15:03.319 --> 15:06.822
<i>let's just make sure I get
my two friends out the door with the team,</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:08.240
<i>and back inside safely.</i>

15:11.410 --> 15:15.080
Houston's go.
We're handing over in 20 seconds,

15:15.164 --> 15:16.832
so I'll talk to you in about 40.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.216
<i>Okay. Copy.</i>

15:26.300 --> 15:29.428
<i>And Drew just reported
that the hatch is open and stowed.</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:32.890
Good luck out there. Have a lot of fun.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.267
We are very excited for you
to be finishing off

15:35.392 --> 15:38.562
all of the amazing work that
you've already put into this AMS repair.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.231
Great work,
Jessica and Nanna. All right,

15:41.315 --> 15:43.108
Drew and Luca, let's get after it.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.172
<i>Okay, check your
display switches are functional.</i>

16:11.595 --> 16:13.639
Okay.
Well, the helmet camera is up.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.558
<i>Drew, you're leading out obviously.</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:18.352
<i>And putting down</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.646
<i>the safety tether.
You're on safety tether.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:54.555
<i>Looks like the sun
is on its way down right now.</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:56.724
<i>-So, visors as required.</i>
Copy that.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.202
<i>We did a lot of testing
to show that these pumps will run.</i>

17:19.538 --> 17:21.540
<i>The weak link
is always going to be the fittings,</i>

17:21.623 --> 17:23.625
<i>because they're swaged fittings,
they're not welded.</i>

17:26.628 --> 17:28.797
<i>I'll be disappointed
if we see that red band.</i>

17:29.590 --> 17:31.925
<i>That means
one of the primary seals failed.</i>

17:36.597 --> 17:38.265
<i>The odds are, it's going to be fine.</i>

17:39.475 --> 17:43.062
<i>But once you've done a leak test,
it's more than 99.9 percent...</i>

17:44.146 --> 17:46.106
chance it's going to be successful.

17:46.231 --> 17:51.779
<i>So, that's why I have stuck to my guns
saying that we have to do the leak test.</i>

17:52.696 --> 17:55.324
<i>There's been a lot of people
trying to talk me out of it.</i>

17:57.242 --> 17:59.578
AMS, CERN you have a hot mic.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.082
<i>Copy. Thank you.</i>

18:03.957 --> 18:06.168
So, big picture,
we'll proceed with the rest of the leak

18:06.251 --> 18:07.628
while we wait the hour on this one.

18:07.836 --> 18:11.006
And, I have to say it out loud just
because this is buttoned up,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.717
and in its final config.
What we're doing is unbuttoning it

18:13.801 --> 18:16.345
to go and inspect it.
You got to ask yourself,

18:16.470 --> 18:20.724
can we just move on and just
not inspect, and leave it be?

18:20.849 --> 18:24.144
It's not like we have a whole lot
of time to spend on stuff like that.

18:24.728 --> 18:25.979
Something to think about, but...

18:26.063 --> 18:28.690
Oh, I don't think we need
to check any of them. But...

18:30.275 --> 18:33.028
-... we're executing program priorities.
How many more...

18:33.112 --> 18:36.031
<i>We've got so much going on
the Space Station in the next two months.</i>

18:36.198 --> 18:39.910
<i>We are expecting a SpaceX launch
in an incredibly busy December.</i>

18:40.369 --> 18:43.831
That's a good place to start.
- We need to finish removing and replacing

18:43.914 --> 18:46.542
some batteries, which is the life support,

18:46.625 --> 18:47.876
<i>keeping the ISS going.</i>

18:49.169 --> 18:52.548
<i>We're all working very hard to figure out
what the highest priorities are.</i>

18:53.173 --> 18:56.677
You're wanting to get that
if we tighten it, why are we waiting

18:56.760 --> 18:58.762
a whole hour
if we can actually see pressures

18:58.846 --> 19:00.931
when we manipulate the system but...

19:01.223 --> 19:02.975
That's not the way it works.

19:03.058 --> 19:06.979
But I would say that an hour is not enough
to see anything either.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.397
It's an arbitrary number.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.649
- It's the number that y'all chose.
- No. It is not an arbitrary number.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.778
Every minute is hugely valuable.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.365
We've gone through an enormous amount
of risk to get these crew members outside,

19:18.490 --> 19:22.411
<i>and we only have six and a half hours,
and I need to make the most</i>

19:22.578 --> 19:26.373
out of every single one
of those minutes. I will not wait.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.543
That's right. If you remove the cover
you're going to lower the temperature.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.296
- I understand all of that part.
- And condense more liquid.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.549
I'm just saying that's the same
as not having looked at it at all.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.259
- So, you're saying...
- Which I'm fine with.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.262
Nothing ever beats a test. Which is why

19:40.345 --> 19:44.016
it can be frustrating to talk to several
other members of the cooperation as well,

19:44.099 --> 19:47.936
and we all came to the same conclusion
that this is not a good thing to do.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.939
First of all was the buckle sabers
could come off.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.776
I mean, if you're still sending
the arm to get the shower pep,

19:54.985 --> 19:56.612
you haven't saved us anything.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.327
<i>Ultimately, we're going to go,
and execute according to the goals</i>

20:03.410 --> 20:05.662
<i>-that the program gives us.</i>
- I'm just making clear,

20:05.746 --> 20:07.497
we're going to leave AMS
and go do other things.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.291
I just want to make sure
everybody understands that,

20:09.416 --> 20:12.294
so nobody's surprised.
We'll get as much AMS done

20:12.377 --> 20:13.462
as AMS will allow us to.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.716
Only the flight controllers in the rim
can really have that level

20:17.799 --> 20:21.094
of decision-making authority.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.724
Okay. Any other comments?
- Thank you.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.394
All right, next is leak check.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.355
<i>It's never going to happen.</i>

20:32.022 --> 20:34.191
You have got to remember,
I grew up a plumber.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.069
You always do leak tests, so...

20:43.533 --> 20:46.703
So Luca, what do you see?
How's it looking for you?

20:53.001 --> 20:54.670
Yeah. Makes most sense.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.090
I think for getting
the right line of sight on those AAFs.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.722
<i>There's one position
where six of the fittings are,</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:07.849
<i>and then there's
another position down underneath</i>

21:07.933 --> 21:09.518
<i>where two of the fittings are.</i>

21:10.185 --> 21:12.604
<i>Drew's going to be down
underneath on the arm,</i>

21:12.771 --> 21:15.190
<i>and Luca is going be free-floating.</i>

21:22.030 --> 21:23.490
Okay.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.368
<i>So, we weren't absolutely sure</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:28.787
<i>who was gonna get
to the first fitting first.</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:31.957
<i>Because moving the arm
is a very slow process.</i>

21:45.387 --> 21:48.515
<i>All right,
you're going first, number five.</i>

21:48.932 --> 21:50.642
<i>Let me get caught up to you here.</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:56.023
You see now we are this side.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.902
Yeah, this is EV2, Luca.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.989
We'll take Luca.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.330
<i>So, I understand
we're going for number five first.</i>

22:11.496 --> 22:13.707
<i>First step is to open the MOI sleeve.</i>

22:26.094 --> 22:29.598
<i>Okay, once you're convinced
you've got it in the right orientation,</i>

22:29.681 --> 22:33.894
<i>think about the line of sight
you want on that leak indicator,</i>

22:34.019 --> 22:36.646
<i>and then very carefully
open the VLI handle.</i>

23:05.759 --> 23:06.802
Copy.

23:09.930 --> 23:14.684
Looks like a lot of force that he's having
to use to pull the handle open which is...

23:16.561 --> 23:18.438
Normally it just pops right open.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.608
In the test, I see him
struggling with the handle,

23:21.775 --> 23:24.319
maybe we can use
the wrench and he got it.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.470
<i>Okay, we copy that.
I think I can see in the camera, as well.</i>

23:50.595 --> 23:53.598
<i>Just move that peg, the number five peg
out of the way there, Luca,</i>

23:53.682 --> 23:55.642
<i>for a second, just lift up the five.</i>

23:58.186 --> 23:59.896
- Yeah, that's it.
All right, EVA.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.774
Wow.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.154
Crib sheet page 41.
<i>What EVA we are on?</i>

24:07.237 --> 24:08.822
<i>Page 41 of the crib sheet,</i>

24:08.947 --> 24:11.825
block foxtrot for leak check,
any red showing.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.165
He'll need the wrench from the MOI bag.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.133
Say again? Louder.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.970
Did we see any change in pressure?

24:35.932 --> 24:37.142
No.
No.

24:37.392 --> 24:38.643
Pressure's steady.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.189
You need to report any pressure changes.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.441
Okay.
Yes.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.822
So he had a real hard time
opening the VLI handle,

24:50.906 --> 24:54.284
we don't think there's any correlation
with that and seeing red.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.580
There very well could be,
that is typically the indicator

24:58.663 --> 25:00.707
of fairly high pressure inside the VLI.

25:12.552 --> 25:13.595
Wow.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.391
I can... You can see the red even
in this helmet camera.

25:19.559 --> 25:23.730
So, the first step of the crib sheet
in this situation is to tighten it

25:24.481 --> 25:28.527
one more eighth of a turn.
And then wait an hour.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.824
Okay, so what we're going
to tighten to, Luca, is Bravo 2-1,

25:34.950 --> 25:37.410
Bravo 21 and tighten one turn.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.622
<i>Copy.</i>

25:40.747 --> 25:42.332
We're going to finish this tighten

25:42.415 --> 25:43.917
we want to start the one-hour clock.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.128
<i>Copy all.</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:52.551
<i>Okay,
I copy Bravo 2-1, that's good.</i>

25:52.634 --> 25:55.512
<i>Go ahead and tighten
the VLI handle. Remember...</i>

25:55.595 --> 25:58.139
<i>So now of course all the stuff's
going through my head,</i>

25:58.348 --> 25:59.432
<i>what did I do wrong?</i>

25:59.599 --> 26:02.269
<i>Yeah. What did I forget?
What didn't I test?</i>

26:02.352 --> 26:04.813
<i>What didn't I think of that would
cause this thing to pop?</i>

26:04.896 --> 26:06.982
<i>Either this is
a systemic problem in all of them.</i>

26:07.107 --> 26:09.276
<i>To have it on the first one.</i>

26:09.859 --> 26:12.070
<i>Every one of them was going
to leak, the first one leaked.</i>

26:13.572 --> 26:16.616
<i>Statistically,
you are a one-for-one failure now.</i>

26:19.035 --> 26:20.287
The next one...

26:20.745 --> 26:22.706
<i>Next one must not leak.</i>

26:25.542 --> 26:27.210
<i>All right, Luca, so you're going back</i>

26:27.294 --> 26:28.962
<i>to choose another tube, and Drew,</i>

26:29.045 --> 26:31.464
<i>you choose whatever one's
most convenient for you.</i>

26:42.642 --> 26:44.728
<i>Okay, copy, you're on the eight</i>

26:46.104 --> 26:48.648
<i>Drew is at...
When you do open the VLI,</i>

26:49.149 --> 26:52.027
<i>do not touch the cap, or the cylinder.</i>

26:52.152 --> 26:54.779
<i>Okay, you're go to open the VLI,
watch the cylinder.</i>

27:01.036 --> 27:03.622
<i>Okay,
that one look like it opened real nicely.</i>

27:03.705 --> 27:05.415
<i>So you can go ahead
and close the VLI.</i>

27:05.582 --> 27:06.708
No red.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.723
<i>Okay, copy.</i>

27:21.848 --> 27:23.975
<i>So good on eight as well.</i>

27:26.186 --> 27:28.730
- Two-one.
- Number eight also had no red?

27:29.689 --> 27:30.690
<i>Correct.</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:54.422
Okay. You're wrapped up on six.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.940
All right. Copy, seven is good.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.495
<i>Okay, one is good.
Just number three left to check.</i>

28:32.919 --> 28:34.713
You're go, Luca.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.010
- No red. It's only one.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.348
<i>All right, three's good.</i>

28:45.432 --> 28:47.851
So, in one hour we'll be
at the top of the hour.

28:48.017 --> 28:51.813
And, we'll expire at 14:00.
TMT. Pressure's, okay?

28:51.938 --> 28:56.067
Pressure is okay, and they reset
the VLI, to the pressure of 13 bar.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.657
<i>They checked seven,
and they're good.</i>

29:03.074 --> 29:06.870
So, they re-tightened
the first fitting as planned.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.291
And we started a one-hour clock as we say,

29:11.416 --> 29:14.669
one-hour wait
to re-pressurize this fitting to see

29:14.753 --> 29:17.630
if it's now leak-tight,
come back at the top of the hour,

29:17.714 --> 29:19.549
and see if it's okay or not.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.429
Okay. Our next step
is to get an assessment from Luca.

29:25.138 --> 29:29.142
He's demonstrated that he's able
to tighten with the wrench,

29:29.267 --> 29:33.605
and so we need to determine
where are we sending Drew next.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.274
That was shocking
to see that on the first one.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.860
If it was the third one or the fifth one,
okay, that's the one that's leaking.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.404
But when you see the first one do that,
first thing you say is,

29:41.488 --> 29:45.742
oh, my God, there is a systematic flaw,
you're one-for-one, one-for-one failure.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.954
So, okay, so seeing the next one open,

29:50.455 --> 29:53.166
and having no indication at all, was huge.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.127
Yeah, right now I'm thinking
we're not gonna leave the

29:56.211 --> 30:00.673
common position until we get
a read on tube five. But...

30:01.424 --> 30:02.926
Comms flight will discuss...

30:07.263 --> 30:12.143
<i>So the big picture plan right now
is we'll wait another 18 minutes</i>

30:12.227 --> 30:18.024
<i>until the clock expires on tube five.
We'll have Luca check it and...</i>

30:18.149 --> 30:20.026
- First one will be the best one, right?
Yeah.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.195
- We're about down 20 minutes.
Right.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.615
He chose wisely.
- He chose wisely, yes.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.452
<i>If we have
a big leak like we had initially,</i>

30:29.536 --> 30:33.456
<i>that might send us direct to a jumper
and that's why we'll hold you at common,</i>

30:33.581 --> 30:37.418
<i>Drew, because we might want to bring
the AAR main to the VSP in that case.</i>

30:37.502 --> 30:38.586
Now we start.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.383
Mike, are they on time?

30:44.133 --> 30:45.802
They're a little bit behind.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.598
When you...

30:51.057 --> 30:55.144
When we plan for a spacewalk,
you're always thinking about

30:55.311 --> 30:58.606
what happens if this situation
doesn't play out.

30:58.898 --> 31:02.443
You're going through all
of the preparation with these guys.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.905
I know exactly the steps,
and the procedure.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.784
I know probably what Luca was thinking
when he saw the red,

31:09.868 --> 31:12.662
he even reported it like...
you could hear it in his voice,

31:13.371 --> 31:16.374
"I'm sorry guys,
I'm sorry to tell you, but I see red."

31:19.544 --> 31:23.047
Yeah, so it doesn't matter
where you watch it, when,

31:23.172 --> 31:24.883
it's still the same.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.804
<i>We are at
12 minutes to go on that clock.</i>

31:30.597 --> 31:32.432
<i>So I don't know if you guys are just bored</i>

31:32.515 --> 31:36.269
out there and filling time but you
could tell me, a non-spacewalker,

31:36.394 --> 31:38.396
<i>what it looks like in a night pass</i>

31:38.479 --> 31:40.023
<i>looking down at the planet.
What do you see?</i>

31:58.041 --> 32:00.501
<i>Yeah,
it looks like you're above</i>

32:00.585 --> 32:02.128
<i>the Sea of Japan just off</i>

32:02.211 --> 32:05.673
the east side of Asia there.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.177
<i></i>

32:18.561 --> 32:21.564
Jeremy just told them
they're above the Sea of Japan.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.778
<i>I'm hearing on the back loops
that Chris is in Japan today.</i>

32:26.861 --> 32:28.404
<i>So you can wave at him on your way by.</i>

32:35.954 --> 32:39.040
Drew just said,
"Hello, Tsukuba." That's kind of cool.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.428
<i>That's cool.</i>

32:53.763 --> 32:55.848
They just said,
"Thanks for the mentorship, Chris."

32:56.683 --> 32:59.060
That's freaking cool. That's awesome.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.314
It's always cool
to get a shoutout from space.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.069
It's been everyone's pleasure for sure.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.739
So, Luca, I gotta know,
what made you pick number five first?

33:17.412 --> 33:20.289
I think everybody's heart stopped.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.386
Yeah, I had no doubt.

33:34.554 --> 33:38.516
So, the re-inspection,
time to go back in there,

33:38.599 --> 33:40.268
and see what happened.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.575
<i>Okay, gentlemen,
we are a minute to go on that clock.</i>

33:56.617 --> 33:59.620
<i>Drew, question for you,
are you happy staying in the arm,</i>

33:59.746 --> 34:02.206
<i>or do you guys want to just swap roles?</i>

34:10.173 --> 34:11.382
<i>Okay, we're gonna go</i>

34:11.466 --> 34:13.134
<i>with your instincts on this one.</i>

34:13.760 --> 34:16.888
<i>If we swap them now then we
can kind of go with what we're used to.</i>

34:22.477 --> 34:25.646
Okay, so I want you guys
to pull both ends of your waist tethers.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.359
<i>We failed a leak check,
we might not finish this EVA,</i>

34:31.110 --> 34:33.780
<i>and we had talked about the contingency.</i>

34:33.988 --> 34:37.158
We were like, Hey, okay. If it comes
to that point we'll swap roles.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.577
<i>We're in uncharted territory,</i>

34:39.660 --> 34:42.288
<i>and we knew that we were going
to be the most efficient</i>

34:42.413 --> 34:43.956
<i>falling back on what we knew.</i>

34:53.800 --> 34:58.721
Drew, by that time,
he was at least as good as I was

34:58.846 --> 35:00.431
at everything concerning the AMS.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.435
<i>But I had all the experience
in cutting and swaging.</i>

35:04.685 --> 35:08.689
So, we swapped.
But Drew was still in charge.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.535
Yes, yes.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.247
It ju... can be... Not what it is now.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.220
<i>Okay, minute,
and a half have to go. I'll let you know.</i>

35:49.105 --> 35:51.357
You got another 50 seconds to go.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.702
<i>Okay, Luca, you can open the VLI,</i>

36:02.869 --> 36:04.245
<i>do not touch the cap.</i>

36:27.435 --> 36:29.979
<i>No,
we don't have a good enough view to see.</i>

36:39.071 --> 36:40.823
<i>Okay, we copy that, Luca.</i>

36:40.907 --> 36:42.241
<i>How much red we got?</i>

36:53.961 --> 36:55.671
Okay, we copy that.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.928
<i>All right,
we're gonna need a few minutes</i>

37:02.011 --> 37:03.221
<i>to talk about what we're gonna do</i>

37:03.304 --> 37:06.015
<i>from here, gentlemen, so, give us a few
and we'll get back to you.</i>

37:09.477 --> 37:11.437
<i>Copy.
Copy.</i>

37:23.824 --> 37:26.786
- Flight EVA.
<i>Go ahead.</i>

37:27.328 --> 37:31.249
Yes, ma'am.
We would lose approximately...

37:32.041 --> 37:35.419
<i>30 to 45 minutes of EVA time.</i>

37:35.836 --> 37:37.129
<i>Copy.</i>

37:37.964 --> 37:41.384
We're getting there, gentlemen.
So, I'll just give you a little sense

37:41.467 --> 37:45.888
of the heartbeat here on the ground,
you know, the good news story here,

37:46.013 --> 37:50.393
is we have seven out of eight successful.
So, overall we're heading

37:50.476 --> 37:51.936
in the right direction here.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.230
<i>And there isn't really enough time</i>

37:54.355 --> 37:56.524
<i>on this EVA
to get it all done today anyway.</i>

37:56.607 --> 37:58.859
<i>So we'll just take these next steps slow.</i>

37:58.985 --> 38:00.695
<i>Okay, what are we going to do now?</i>

38:01.362 --> 38:03.823
<i>Hey, we didn't train for this,
we didn't simulate it,</i>

38:03.906 --> 38:06.784
<i>you know, we didn't have...
We had no precedent.</i>

38:07.743 --> 38:10.329
<i>All right, let's figure out
how we're going to get around this.</i>

38:12.873 --> 38:16.877
So we've got an hour and a half
currently at the end of the EVA.

38:18.504 --> 38:20.256
<i>So let's talk about the time.</i>

38:21.674 --> 38:23.175
<i>We can always forgo the mud flap,</i>

38:23.259 --> 38:25.177
<i>and the shower cap today to get this done.</i>

38:26.429 --> 38:28.681
Task EVO.
EVO.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.809
Okay. So we're in a situation
whereas if we tighten it again,

38:31.892 --> 38:34.270
we're committing
to another hour of leak check.

38:35.396 --> 38:38.941
If we're going to jump the situation,
it's doubtful that we can get it done

38:39.025 --> 38:40.067
in this EVA.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.738
A lot of discussion happening right now.
Fast and furious.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.242
<i>For some reason, this swage
is just not a good one.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:54.373
If this is the swage, this...
These two tubes are mated together...

38:55.624 --> 38:57.084
and there's a leak there.

38:58.002 --> 39:02.506
So the way to fix it is you cut it out,

39:02.590 --> 39:05.968
<i>and you... And we put in this jumper.</i>

39:06.594 --> 39:11.474
<i>It's a way to fix it,
but now you have two junctions.</i>

39:11.682 --> 39:15.853
Okay, if we think we can get
the jumper done today

39:15.978 --> 39:19.148
then we should try to do it.
If we don't think we can get it done today

39:19.231 --> 39:21.942
then we'd like to go ahead
and tighten another eighth of a turn.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.652
<i>Copy.</i>

39:24.195 --> 39:27.239
<i>And so I made the call
to the EVA task guy.</i>

39:28.032 --> 39:30.743
EVA Task,
I think we do have time for the jumper.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.662
I think
we'd go ahead, tighten the extra flap,

39:33.746 --> 39:35.748
<i>Who,
says it to the EVA operations guy.</i>

39:35.956 --> 39:38.334
The crew has swapped roles
from the original plan.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.586
- We are good to proceed if the crew is.
Understood.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.421
<i>Who says it to the flight director.</i>

39:42.546 --> 39:45.132
Okay, the big picture for the crew,
we're going to be sending Drew

39:45.257 --> 39:49.970
to the VSB worksite and we'll have Luca
go ahead tighten one more flap,

39:50.054 --> 39:51.138
cover it back up, and then...

39:51.263 --> 39:53.474
<i>Who says it to the ground IV guy.</i>

39:53.599 --> 39:57.103
<i>Okay.
For everybody involved, here's the plan.</i>

39:57.228 --> 40:00.606
We're going to quickly
throw one more flap on this AAF,

40:01.190 --> 40:03.067
and we'll start the clock on that
and then we're going to...

40:03.192 --> 40:04.944
<i>Who says it to the crew.</i>

40:05.027 --> 40:06.362
<i>And then we're gonna start</i>

40:06.445 --> 40:09.573
<i>setting up to do the jumper.
We may be able to finish that leak check.</i>

40:09.824 --> 40:10.825
Copy.

40:12.201 --> 40:16.622
<i>Tighten it again, check it again.
Maybe we'll get lucky.</i>

40:25.548 --> 40:28.008
<i>Okay, I'm assuming
you're following on this.</i>

40:30.845 --> 40:34.849
<i>So, you understand that we've already
failed the leak test twice.</i>

40:35.474 --> 40:36.851
- Yes.
<i>And that we're going to give this</i>

40:36.934 --> 40:40.855
<i>one more try, and if it doesn't work,
we're going to the jumper configuration.</i>

40:43.149 --> 40:45.025
First thing we're gonna
do now is get that clock started.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.486
So, Luca, we're going
to put another flap on that AAF.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.449
<i>Yeah, tighten it one turn only.</i>
Yes.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.535
<i>We're going to try to do everything</i>

40:55.369 --> 40:57.746
<i>-Go slow or go fast.</i>
- Yeah.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.957
<i>But there's a good chance
we won't finish everything.</i>

41:07.756 --> 41:09.258
<i>When we did it on the ground</i>

41:09.341 --> 41:11.135
<i>under these conditions, under pressure</i>

41:11.218 --> 41:14.472
<i>and it sealed,
it got 51 million times better.</i>

41:17.224 --> 41:18.767
<i>Sure thing.</i>

41:21.020 --> 41:23.397
<i>We've been doing this
for 25 years now.</i>

41:24.815 --> 41:27.485
<i>AMS is worth it
because it's groundbreaking science.</i>

41:30.112 --> 41:33.324
<i>Too good of an asset to just say,
all right, we're going to let this go.</i>

41:35.117 --> 41:36.410
Don't want to let it go.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.801
<i>Okay.</i>

41:58.224 --> 42:00.351
We're ready for a leak check
whenever the crew is.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.436
<i>Yep, ready for leak check.</i>

42:02.811 --> 42:05.064
Okay, Luca,
you can go ahead and do the leak check.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.233
Open the VLI without touching the cap.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.929
Okay, close it quick.

42:41.100 --> 42:45.020
Okay, let us all take a breath
down here and I'll get back to you.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.565
We are happy with that leak check
but no red showing.

42:47.815 --> 42:51.694
<i>We are pressing ahead with the rest
of the timeline from installing the MLI.</i>

42:51.819 --> 42:53.696
- We aren't finished yet.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.793
You can close up
that MLI Luca, while you're waiting.

43:11.338 --> 43:16.093
I can tell you with great
assurance there's a huge team of people

43:16.176 --> 43:18.470
on the ground that'll breathe
a huge sigh of relief

43:18.596 --> 43:21.140
after your work today.
And you certainly saved

43:21.223 --> 43:24.685
the most entertaining EVA repair
and hopefully the last.

43:24.810 --> 43:28.439
So it was hard-fought today,
really well done. Cool heads prevailed,

43:28.856 --> 43:32.401
and your preparation really showed.
So nice work to both of you.

43:32.735 --> 43:35.446
And a debt
of gratitude from the whole team.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.049
I had too many beers.

44:08.771 --> 44:12.816
So nobody knew if this would work,
yeah, and we are still on track.

44:13.317 --> 44:16.153
Also I'm saying that nobody expected
it would be possible.

44:17.863 --> 44:19.531
And that's how I was like,

44:19.657 --> 44:21.492
I couldn't see anything.
Because, I was like...

44:23.035 --> 44:27.289
What just happened?
This is not... I could not be...

44:27.414 --> 44:30.167
- I literally can't believe my eyes.
- I thought it was going to be subtle.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.337
That's what you expect from NASA, right?

44:33.671 --> 44:35.714
They solve the problems
that nobody else can solve.

44:35.923 --> 44:39.843
Okay? And we were proud of it.
And yeah, it's good.

44:43.013 --> 44:47.685
<i>A lot of those conversations
before we go out the door are all about</i>

44:47.893 --> 44:50.896
pushing against those boundaries,
so I know exactly where they are.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.776
<i>Having different strengths and being able
to play to each other's strengths</i>

44:56.026 --> 44:59.822
all of that was hugely important
to the success of the project.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.783
- And we're done.
Yeah.

45:04.618 --> 45:06.870
Hey, Chris, can you hear me?
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

45:09.248 --> 45:10.249
Were you watching?

45:10.332 --> 45:12.626
<i>I was, I was,
I couldn't believe it.</i>

45:12.751 --> 45:14.461
I could see
he was struggling with it.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.131
<i>Same with me, I saw,
I was like, oh, that's not normal.</i>

45:17.256 --> 45:20.718
<i>That... he's working way too hard
to open that VLI handle.</i>

45:20.884 --> 45:24.304
That's right. And I'll tell you,
we were all jumping for joy

45:24.680 --> 45:28.267
when he did it again
and it didn't show, so...

45:31.979 --> 45:33.772
<i>After the mission...</i>

45:33.939 --> 45:35.899
<i>Like, oh, man, it's over.</i>

45:36.734 --> 45:40.320
I'm super proud, and just thinking back

45:40.404 --> 45:43.282
over the last couple of years
of where we started at

45:43.365 --> 45:49.580
with just the tools and the tasks
and to this point, just amazing. And...

45:50.622 --> 45:54.877
<i>That's sad, to see
that disappear and everybody scatter.</i>

45:56.962 --> 45:58.547
<i>Welcome to Houston...</i>

45:59.131 --> 46:01.300
<i>I'm so excited
that I got to be part of it all.</i>

46:30.621 --> 46:34.875
<i>The system is pressurized
and then we're just in operation mode.</i>

46:36.210 --> 46:38.670
AMS, take data,
Professor Ting, write your papers,

46:39.588 --> 46:42.883
antimatter, dark matter, dark energy,
here we come.

47:00.692 --> 47:02.069
One moment, please.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.238
Everybody say AMS.

47:04.321 --> 47:07.324
AMS!
