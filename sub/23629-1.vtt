00:38.204 --> 00:40.139
In the middle
of the 21st century,

00:40.141 --> 00:45.310
Mother Nature finally unleashed
her fury in a cataclysmic event

00:45.312 --> 00:46.612
known as the Cloud Fall.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.317
Ice caps melted so
quickly that entire cities

00:52.319 --> 00:55.554
were wiped out within months.

00:55.556 --> 01:00.159
Once the rains began, it was
flooding on a biblical scale.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.428
It destroyed almost
the entire planet.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.635
Pockets of respite
on high ground

01:09.637 --> 01:12.571
allowed those few who
survived to start again.

01:15.308 --> 01:18.210
50 years after the
Cloud Fall, two things

01:18.212 --> 01:22.181
essential for survival that had
been taken for granted for so

01:22.183 --> 01:25.084
long are now rare commodities--

01:25.086 --> 01:27.619
air and water.

01:27.621 --> 01:31.457
In this new barter economy,
there were two currencies--

01:31.459 --> 01:36.228
water tabs to purify poisonous
rainwater and pure, powdered

01:36.230 --> 01:40.499
silver, an essential
component in air filters

01:40.501 --> 01:43.802
that can delay eventual
death, like black lung.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.110
New and rudimentary
authorities began to keep

01:51.112 --> 01:52.778
people safe as possible.

01:56.649 --> 02:01.253
Vehicles that burned
fossil fuels, or belchers,

02:01.255 --> 02:03.355
were illegal.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.125
Those that drove them
were guilty of the most

02:06.127 --> 02:07.459
heinous crime possible.

02:10.395 --> 02:13.398
The new authority offered
rewards to bring these outlaws

02:13.400 --> 02:17.803
to justice and bounty
hunters roamed the wasteland

02:17.805 --> 02:19.838
looking to claim those rewards.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.949
Ah!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.317
No!

03:05.319 --> 03:06.919
What are you doing?

03:06.921 --> 03:10.889
I can't survive out
here without-- ugh, ugh.

03:10.891 --> 03:15.360
sometimes I
think you don't even like me.

03:15.362 --> 03:19.398
She's picking me up and dragging
my ass across the wilderness

03:19.400 --> 03:23.335
Seriously, what the fuck
is up with a coffin?

03:23.337 --> 03:26.838
Whoa, Womack, when did
you get so sensitive?

03:28.776 --> 03:31.743
Oh.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.846
OK, OK, just take me in.

03:34.848 --> 03:35.714
Just take me in.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.848
I've had it.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.584
Just take me in.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.385
Come on.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.554
Chavo, where's Chavo?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.723
East, east,
they're on the east.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.925
She got wind of some
pilgrims down by the docks.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.498
See you next time.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.633
No.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.235
There's no next time, Gage.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.869
That is the point.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.904
Hey, where are you going?

03:58.906 --> 03:59.938
Aw, look at that.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.975
It stopped raining.

04:02.977 --> 04:04.843
Drinking water?

04:04.845 --> 04:05.844
That's it?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.380
But I helped you.

04:08.382 --> 04:11.383
Gage, I'm going to die out here.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.952
Looks like you're
going to need it.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.487
There's a burner on the way.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.528
But I helped you!

04:23.530 --> 04:24.529
I helped you, Gage!

04:24.531 --> 04:26.331
Where are you going?

04:26.333 --> 04:28.800
I'm going to die out here.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.407
Gage!

04:35.409 --> 04:37.943
Suck wind and die, Gage.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.977
Damn it.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.684
Look at you.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.557
Who have we got here?

04:57.764 --> 05:00.299
Aw.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.000
Look at how pretty you are.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.537
Sh.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.706
Look, we have
an advance permit,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.975
issued by the
territorial authority,

05:09.977 --> 05:12.544
guaranteeing us safe passage.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.447
We are on a pilgrimage.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.716
And if we don't make
our destination,

05:17.718 --> 05:20.352
a bounty will be
issued for your head.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.553
Oh I'm sorry.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.523
I didn't know.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.024
I feel stupid.

05:26.026 --> 05:26.958
Forgive me.

05:29.729 --> 05:36.501
Well, I bid you all a good day
and wish you a safe journey.

05:37.905 --> 05:41.907
Thing is, if you all
disappear without a trace,

05:41.909 --> 05:45.977
how they going to know
who to put that bounty on?

05:45.979 --> 05:49.348
There's no authority out here.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.949
Now if the rest
of you cooperate,

05:50.951 --> 05:54.386
you just might live
to see another day.

05:54.388 --> 06:06.765
And you-- what's this?

06:10.503 --> 06:11.903
Silver.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.907
Well, that's an
unexpected surprise.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.110
I'm going to grind
this up and put it

06:18.112 --> 06:20.645
in my own personal air filter.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.514
And I'm going to think
of you every time

06:22.516 --> 06:25.517
I suck a fresh breath.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.553
Get the usual--
filters, water, tabs.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.758
I know someone paying top
dollar for able bodies.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.670
Hey, who's out there?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.472
Hey, Chavo.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.940
God damn it.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.042
Go to hell, Gage.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.944
I will, I promise.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.881
There's two ways
we could do this.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.687
That's one of them.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.824
Hey, hey-- she's over there.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.793
Go around.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.561
Go!

07:09.563 --> 07:12.497
Where the hell are you going?

07:16.702 --> 07:18.570
Oh, big mistake.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.973
Nobody runs out on
you, right, Chavo?

07:21.975 --> 07:26.912
Look, scumbag, I'm just trying
to get by like everybody else.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.815
Thing is, you've been
a really bag girl, Chavo,

07:29.817 --> 07:32.984
and that makes you very
attractive to a scumbag

07:32.986 --> 07:33.952
like me.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.997
Listen, I'll let them all go
if you give me a walk, Gage.

07:45.999 --> 07:52.003
Nothing compared to
what I could get for you.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.872
You know that.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.474
I'll blow her
head off, and then

07:55.476 --> 07:56.875
I'll kill the rest of them.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.777
I'll do it, you know I will.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.146
And then you can tell
that to the Authority.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.015
You hear me?

08:04.017 --> 08:04.983
Loud and clear.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.231
Thank you so much.

08:19.233 --> 08:22.133
I'm really going to need
you to stay out of my way.

08:22.135 --> 08:27.172
Not necessary.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.130
Damn it.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.872
No, I just lost half a bounty.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.941
Well, I'm sure once we
tell your employer what

10:09.943 --> 10:11.343
you did here, they
will reinstate

10:11.345 --> 10:14.045
the full value of the reward.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.015
Wow, man, you really
are as naive as you look.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.290
Where are you going?

10:25.292 --> 10:29.160
You've got to help us get
him to medical assistance.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.095
Not my problem.

11:12.973 --> 11:17.676
a warm welcome to the two newest
members of the community of New

11:17.678 --> 11:18.343
Montana.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.846
There are viable hempseed that's
going to be critical for us

11:21.848 --> 11:24.082
in the years to come.

11:24.084 --> 11:28.687
is saying that there will be no
spike in toxin levels expected

11:28.689 --> 11:30.955
this week, but that's
still no excuse

11:30.957 --> 11:32.757
to be leaving a
sealed environment

11:32.759 --> 11:34.693
without a backup breather.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.128
So one last thing,
we've been getting

11:37.130 --> 11:39.330
reports of increased
outlaw activity

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
in the surrounding areas.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.034
So keep an eye
out for strangers,

11:43.036 --> 11:47.005
not just for yourself,
but for your neighbors.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.708
The Territorial
Authority wants us

11:49.710 --> 11:56.114
to report potential activity--

11:56.116 --> 11:59.250
Meeting adjourned.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.400
Gage.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.512
You can count it, if you want.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.387
There's only
water tabs in here.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.922
Where's the powdered silver?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.925
Yeah, the Authority
didn't send any.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.128
I don't know why.

12:43.130 --> 12:47.365
water and air scrubbers running
for the rest of the month.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.972
Right, so the
Authorities set the bounty

12:53.974 --> 12:57.542
at 300 tabs and two grams
of silver for Chavo,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.911
and then doesn't
send the silver.

12:59.913 --> 13:04.315
I mean, you could
tell me the truth.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.555
You'll get what's owed.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.358
I just need a little more time.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.194
You've got enough to get by.

13:16.196 --> 13:21.266
and health of the hardworking
people of this town.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.200
Really?

13:26.305 --> 13:29.974
Tell me, what are you
going to do when all

13:29.976 --> 13:32.477
the belchers have been retired?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.880
I'll come looking for you.

13:35.882 --> 13:40.218
You're just trash
like the rest of them.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.288
What makes you so different than
the bounties you drag in here?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.592
I'm still above ground.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.244
Well, would you look at that?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.879
They did send the
silver after all.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.613
Hm.

14:46.252 --> 14:50.421
I taught you never to sit
with your back to the door,

14:50.423 --> 14:53.892
especially when you're
breaking into someone's home.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.894
Yeah, you also taught
me collecting bounties

14:55.896 --> 14:59.397
was a noble profession.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.966
I wouldn't play with
that, if I were you.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.502
It's concentrated acid.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.972
That'll cut through you like--

15:07.974 --> 15:09.340
well, concentrated acid.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.180
I saw what was left of Chavo.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.052
Nice shooting.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.221
My aim will never be
as good as yours, Doc.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.223
Aw, that's all in the past.

15:25.225 --> 15:31.462
Since this, I'm happy just
being a simple country doctor.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.197
It was fun though--

15:33.199 --> 15:35.533
taking down fossil
abusers with you.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.069
You seen the latest bulletin?

15:38.071 --> 15:41.172
Sure, Tom Jackson, 5,000 tabs.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.108
Biggest bounty the
Authorities ever offered.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.445
Even Grubbs is talking
about raising a posse

15:47.447 --> 15:49.213
and taking a shot at it.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.515
Jackson's nothing special.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.120
I taught you better than that.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.090
He's consolidating.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.025
He took over this settlement.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.994
Place called Defiance,
built from the ground

16:02.996 --> 16:08.499
Made it a safe haven for
lawbreakers, most of them

16:08.501 --> 16:13.137
Someone with your
talents could clean up.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.505
You'd have to be crazy to try.

16:19.112 --> 16:23.648
You're wondering if you
can take them alone.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.484
You can't.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.652
Why not?

16:27.654 --> 16:32.991
Leaves their bodies hanging
from the gate as a warning.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.494
Just forget I ever
brought it up.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.229
Yeah, but you did.

16:56.482 --> 16:57.482
Gage!

16:57.484 --> 16:58.416
Gage!

17:22.574 --> 17:23.508
Jackson.

17:27.780 --> 17:28.713
Don't.

17:28.715 --> 17:34.052
He wouldn't let a bounty hunter
within 10 clicks of Defiance.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.187
Maybe not a bounty hunter.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.355
What do you mean?

17:44.830 --> 17:45.797
What?

17:45.799 --> 17:49.267
You look like you
wearing Chavo's hat.

17:49.269 --> 17:53.304
got Chavo lying on a slab
right in front of you.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.073
So that's your plan?

17:55.075 --> 17:58.309
I've already killed
everyone she's running with.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.744
Who's going to know
the difference?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.080
Anyone that knows your face.

18:02.082 --> 18:07.118
This is what most
people ever see of me.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.523
No, but if it gets me
into town, then maybe--

18:12.525 --> 18:14.258
Maybe it can delay
how long it takes

18:14.260 --> 18:16.394
you to get yourself killed.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.697
If I leave now, I can
be there before nightfall.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.632
Chavo.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.401
Gage.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.469
Gage.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.771
Chavo.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.674
It's not funny.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.209
It's a little bit funny.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.577
You really need to lighten up.

18:36.748 --> 18:40.251
I'll see you soon.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.652
Please don't do this.

18:48.528 --> 18:54.298
you around once in a while,
even just for a couple of days.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.404
I'll be extra careful
crossing the river.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.305
Wait.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.451
It'll just even out
the odds a little.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.680
On the house.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.306
Who's that?

21:48.308 --> 21:52.977
Chavo, you can tell by the hat.

22:07.492 --> 22:14.999
Empty bottles
and a wasted name.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.668
You can change the
rules, my baby,

22:17.670 --> 22:20.638
but you can't quite
change the game.

22:23.342 --> 22:29.714
If the feeling ain't
the same anymore,

22:29.716 --> 22:37.688
my baby you can hear me call,
but you cannot see me cry.

22:37.690 --> 22:49.066
And I sing all my lullabies,
but they never put me to sleep.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.115
Excuse me.

23:04.117 --> 23:09.553
on someone in the
middle of a performance,

23:09.555 --> 23:12.156
especially when that
someone is my lady.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.024
Well, thing is, I
don't know who you are

23:14.026 --> 23:15.893
or that that was
your lady, how was I

23:15.895 --> 23:18.462
supposed to know that
my exit would have such

23:18.464 --> 23:20.631
an impact on your fragile ego?

23:24.936 --> 23:28.005
My name is Thomas Jackson.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.040
This is my town.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.642
Congratulations.

23:34.112 --> 23:37.481
Have a drink with
me, Miss Chavo.

23:37.483 --> 23:40.084
Come on, just one drink--

23:40.086 --> 23:41.919
single malt.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.688
I'm not in the habit of
owing anyone any favors.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.691
Oh, there's no
obligation, I promise.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.927
Simply join me for
a nice civil chat.

23:49.929 --> 23:54.799
We may find that conversation
mutually beneficial.

23:54.801 --> 23:58.869
All right, Let's see what
you have to say, Mr. Jenson.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.871
That's Jackson.

24:02.842 --> 24:03.741
Meh.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.048
Are you a gambler, Ms. Chavo?

24:11.050 --> 24:14.585
Isn't everyone?

24:14.587 --> 24:16.620
Now please don't
take offense to this,

24:16.622 --> 24:20.991
but do you have
anything worth betting?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.092
300 tabs enough?

24:24.796 --> 24:27.598
That'll do.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.467
You don't mind
if I deal, do you?

24:29.469 --> 24:31.202
Is there another option?

24:31.204 --> 24:32.903
No.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.972
Have a seat, Mr. Lear.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.006
This'll take a moment.

24:44.616 --> 24:50.588
So what brings you to
our little metropolis?

24:50.590 --> 24:53.257
I heard bounty hunters
weren't welcome here.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.626
I'm sure you saw the gates.

24:55.628 --> 24:59.563
Territory and Authority
overreach stops right there.

24:59.565 --> 25:02.666
People have to earn
their place here.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.870
So what would you say
is your best asset?

25:05.872 --> 25:07.505
Raise.

25:07.507 --> 25:08.639
I'm a good listener.

25:11.209 --> 25:12.142
Call.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.043
Is that so?

25:23.288 --> 25:26.557
I am very aware of your
exploits, Ms. Chavo--

25:26.559 --> 25:28.859
living in the wasteland,
raiding pilgrims

25:28.861 --> 25:31.795
who were unlucky enough to
get caught up in your web.

25:31.797 --> 25:35.065
I mean, hell, there
are 12 dead last month.

25:35.067 --> 25:38.202
There are not a lot of people
to go around these days.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.942
I have my reasons.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.044
Raise.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.747
I have big plans for
Defiance, and anyone

25:49.749 --> 25:51.949
who comes here to work for me.

25:51.951 --> 25:56.854
You're a good salesman, Mr.
Jackson, but I'm not buying.

25:59.225 --> 26:03.227
Sometimes it's good to
admit when you've been beat.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.868
All in.

26:10.870 --> 26:14.705
Ah, that's how
you want to play it.

26:18.076 --> 26:18.976
Ooh.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.986
Well, would you look at that.

26:28.988 --> 26:29.920
What a deal.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.637
I could really use
someone like you.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.273
Like I said, just
passing through.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.741
It's too bad.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.943
You'd really fit in around here.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.280
As you can see, Mr.
Lear, I'm a little busy.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.248
You want to see this.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.385
Excuse me, Ms. Chavo,
apparently there's

27:01.387 --> 27:05.623
an urgent matter
I must attend to.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.892
Anything Ms. Chavo
wants is on the house.

27:08.894 --> 27:11.128
Please find her a nice,
clean room for the night.

27:14.766 --> 27:15.866
This way, ma'am.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.340
A message from the
Territorial Authority

27:23.342 --> 27:25.776
tells us that Tom
Jackson and his men

27:25.778 --> 27:29.046
are expanding their raids
into nearby settlements

27:29.048 --> 27:31.281
and fortifying Defiance.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.183
We are one of the closest towns.

27:33.185 --> 27:37.054
It is only a matter of time
before he ends up here.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.390
So we need to stop him
before this happens.

27:39.392 --> 27:43.994
It is our duty to
protect our territory.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.830
I need volunteers to come
with me to take him in.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.169
What about the reward?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.071
I hear there's a heavy reward.

27:54.073 --> 27:58.308
Bringing these men to
justice is its own reward,

27:58.310 --> 27:59.243
wouldn't you say, Doc?

27:59.245 --> 28:01.111
No, I wouldn't.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.283
Who's in?

28:11.423 --> 28:14.024
Good, grab whatever
gear you need.

29:10.015 --> 29:13.951
You know, even when
the levels read low,

29:13.953 --> 29:17.755
it's still good to have some
kind of respirator with you.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.757
You've got a lovely
singing voice.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.892
You don't want to ruin
that with a black lung.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.863
Where are you from?

29:25.865 --> 29:26.930
What do you care?

29:30.468 --> 29:35.072
South-- the old Arizona.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.441
I spent some time
there when I was younger.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.043
Were you in the
militia, like Jackson?

29:40.045 --> 29:42.179
Jackson was in the militia?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.514
Figures.

29:43.516 --> 29:47.050
Well, after my parents
died, me and my sister

29:47.052 --> 29:50.354
were put into one
of those work camps.

29:50.356 --> 29:53.423
She was a lot like you--

29:53.425 --> 29:54.324
musical.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.997
What does she play?

29:59.999 --> 30:01.331
She doesn't play anything.

30:04.068 --> 30:05.035
I'm sorry.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.575
What brings you here?

30:11.577 --> 30:16.313
I mean, you've made quite
the impression already.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.081
Must be doing something right.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.318
I've never seen
Lear look so pissed.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.821
I'm just passing through.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.156
What about you?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.025
I lived in a
village with my family

30:28.027 --> 30:35.032
and Jackson found us
there, took me with him.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.836
Why don't you leave
if you're unhappy?

30:38.838 --> 30:41.171
What makes you
think I'm unhappy?

30:41.173 --> 30:42.973
You didn't do
that to yourself.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.277
Look, I'm sorry.

30:47.279 --> 30:53.050
Listen, everyone
I ever knew or loved

30:53.052 --> 30:56.854
was killed by Jackson's man.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.222
What's left out there for me?

31:00.992 --> 31:04.528
Even if I wanted to
leave, he wouldn't let me.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.929
Even if you wanted to?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.267
So what's your strategy?

31:12.570 --> 31:13.971
Do you have one?

31:13.973 --> 31:17.908
Because if not, you're walking
these men into a death trap.

31:17.910 --> 31:21.044
We have the
element of surprise.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.581
Surprise, that's it?

31:24.583 --> 31:29.553
This isn't like busting kids
for pissing in a clean creek.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.155
Jackson's men are
ruthless killers.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.157
Why don't you leave it
to people who are better

31:34.159 --> 31:36.493
suited to this kind of work?

31:36.495 --> 31:40.430
What are you going to tell
these kids when their dads

31:40.432 --> 31:41.932
are dead because of your greed.

31:41.934 --> 31:46.303
That'll be me, because
you'll be dead too.

31:46.305 --> 31:51.074
Don't let your ego get
in the way of common sense.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.076
I know exactly what I'm doing.

31:57.916 --> 32:02.686
It's a fine line between
ignorance and arrogance.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.277
You know what?

32:27.279 --> 32:29.212
I'm done with this.

32:29.214 --> 32:35.419
Oh, I'm so sick and tired of
you constantly controlling me.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.687
I'm my own person.

32:36.689 --> 32:40.624
You seem to have forgotten
who's keeping you alive.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.233
Hey, Chavo!

32:53.037 --> 32:55.238
It's Zee, remember me?

32:58.977 --> 32:59.676
Yeah, sure I do.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.545
Good to see you.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.753
What the hell, Chavo?

33:09.755 --> 33:16.326
when we were buck naked
busting in the barn last month.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.161
Hey, I only remember
the special ones,

33:18.163 --> 33:20.030
and apparently, you're not that.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.164
Hey now, hold up.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.369
You're not Chavo.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.604
Hey, come here.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.539
But you got Chavo's hat.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.675
You got her bandana.

33:31.677 --> 33:35.112
And you definitely
got her attitude.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.748
Now why you want people
thinking you Chavo?

33:37.750 --> 33:41.051
I don't get it, but
that look in your eye

33:41.053 --> 33:43.020
tells me that it would
be dangerous for you

33:43.022 --> 33:44.287
if people knew.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.323
That's right.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.292
All right, well,
how about I keep

33:49.294 --> 33:53.163
my mouth shut and
you keep yours open?

33:53.165 --> 33:55.198
Do I have a choice?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.466
Mm.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.403
Wait.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.104
Not here, please?

34:07.678 --> 34:09.446
Give it to me.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.248
Ah!

34:29.067 --> 34:32.069
Jackson, get down.

34:45.616 --> 34:46.516
You!

35:04.702 --> 35:06.503
Let's take a look
at this asshole.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.310
Wait--

35:18.850 --> 35:20.884
Wow, ruthless.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.753
Huh, so what the
hell was that about?

35:23.755 --> 35:26.189
It seemed like he knew you.

35:26.191 --> 35:30.227
He's a Sheriff in New Montana,
been after me for years.

35:30.229 --> 35:34.397
Keeps sending second rate
bounty hunters after me.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.634
He was a scumbag
by all accounts.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.271
Ah, you did the good people
of New Montana a favor--

35:41.273 --> 35:44.908
your one good deed for the day.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.276
Drag him up.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.569
Think you're pretty
smart, don't ya?

39:01.972 --> 39:03.807
Compared to who?

39:03.809 --> 39:07.977
Well, you don't
have me fooled.

39:07.979 --> 39:12.582
You were in that alley together
when it went down tonight,

39:12.584 --> 39:13.950
I saw you.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.885
What about it?

39:15.887 --> 39:17.821
Well, how'd he get it?

39:17.823 --> 39:20.090
What happened exactly?

39:20.092 --> 39:21.358
Shot in the back.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.727
Shot in the back.

39:23.729 --> 39:27.797
That's real funny, because
my medic took a look at him.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.367
He said cause of death
was knife to the heart.

39:33.037 --> 39:36.606
I asked myself, how
the fuck does he end up

39:36.608 --> 39:39.075
getting knifed in a gun fight?

39:39.077 --> 39:41.578
Maybe he upset someone.

39:41.580 --> 39:45.849
You seem to get
upset quite easily.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.050
You're lying.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.952
I want the truth.

39:48.954 --> 39:52.088
You don't want the truth,
you want an excuse.

39:52.090 --> 39:56.393
I don't need an
excuse with you, Chavo,

39:56.395 --> 39:58.828
or whoever the hell you are.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.965
You really are dumb.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.900
He was raping me.

40:03.902 --> 40:08.071
He dragged me in the
alley and I shived him

40:08.073 --> 40:10.073
before he got what he wanted.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.942
I used his body to save my skin.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.077
He was already dead.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.414
What did he care?

40:17.416 --> 40:22.685
Wait a goddamn minute,
this does not change a thing.

40:22.687 --> 40:23.620
Let it go.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.826
Sleep well, Ms. Chavo.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.561
We'll talk tomorrow.

41:01.725 --> 41:02.625
Morning.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.770
So did you have a little
trouble sleeping last night?

41:13.772 --> 41:15.738
Not at all, I
slept like a baby.

41:15.740 --> 41:21.010
You had one eye on the door all
night just hoping I'd drop by.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.680
Am I right?

41:23.682 --> 41:25.982
Somebody was snooping
around the office there.

41:29.887 --> 41:32.655
You know, if you keep
staring at me like that,

41:32.657 --> 41:34.724
I'm going to start thinking
you're sweet on me.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.093
If you plan on
sticking around,

41:37.095 --> 41:39.028
you better start
showing some respect.

41:39.030 --> 41:39.896
To who?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.564
You?

41:41.566 --> 41:43.533
I could fake it, if you'd like.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.935
You're probably used to that.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.204
You know, you hang your
balls out there like that,

41:48.206 --> 41:50.907
they're going to get busted.

41:50.909 --> 41:56.012
What did you
think was going to happen?

42:05.256 --> 42:08.191
Jackson, you and
me need to talk.

42:08.193 --> 42:13.196
from the spring at Valley Gorge
and you agreed that I could

42:13.198 --> 42:15.732
use that water for my farm.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.535
Yeah, don't pretend
you don't remember.

42:18.537 --> 42:19.969
I'm not stupid.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.305
So tell your pissants to
stay away from my gorge,

42:22.307 --> 42:25.575
or there'll be a couple
less people sucking in air?

42:25.577 --> 42:27.176
Do you understand me?

42:27.178 --> 42:28.811
Look, it's none
of my business,

42:28.813 --> 42:31.147
but you're coming
across very aggressive

42:31.149 --> 42:34.284
and I'm a little concerned you
haven't thought this through.

42:34.286 --> 42:37.186
Who the hell are you,
his fucking mother?

42:37.188 --> 42:39.789
And yeah, it is none
of your business.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.191
Thank you, Ms. Chavo,
but the man is right,

42:42.193 --> 42:45.662
I do need to deal
with this personally.

42:45.664 --> 42:48.598
Oh now, Mr. Bradshaw, I
sincerely hope we don't have

42:48.600 --> 42:51.234
to resort to violence here.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.702
Stay right there.

42:52.704 --> 42:55.038
I mean it.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.840
Now clearly, you have the
upper hand here, Mr. Bradshaw.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.209
I'm not dumb.

43:00.211 --> 43:04.113
So I have a proposal.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.617
I promise that my men will stay
away from your land from now

43:07.619 --> 43:12.355
on if you promise not to come
here again making threats.

43:15.626 --> 43:17.160
Do we have a deal?

43:25.736 --> 43:27.804
OK, deal.

43:29.873 --> 43:31.741
I won't come by
here making threats.

43:34.311 --> 43:37.280
No, you won't.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.790
I appreciate the back-up.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.692
Have dinner with me tonight.

44:30.068 --> 44:34.303
Wow, that's-- you look great.

44:34.305 --> 44:36.673
Thank you.

44:36.675 --> 44:39.442
I had this uniform handmade.

44:39.444 --> 44:41.310
It's a replica of
Simon Bolevar based

44:41.312 --> 44:43.246
on a painting I saw in a book.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.384
What do you think?

44:48.386 --> 44:50.753
It's impressive.

44:50.755 --> 44:53.056
Do you know who Bolevar was?

44:53.058 --> 44:55.358
Some guy, I'm guessing.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.127
He was a nation builder.

44:58.129 --> 45:02.231
He was a man with far
reaching vision, unafraid

45:02.233 --> 45:04.400
to forge his own destiny.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.436
He's my inspiration.

45:06.438 --> 45:08.738
Apparently, he was particularly
adept at recognizing

45:08.740 --> 45:11.774
loyalty amongst his underlings.

45:11.776 --> 45:13.209
He was also very
good at ferreting

45:13.211 --> 45:15.144
out traitors in his midst.

45:15.146 --> 45:19.248
New blood trickles in
every day, any one of them

45:19.250 --> 45:20.717
could be secretly
gunning for me.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.919
It's the law of averages.

45:22.921 --> 45:26.255
Are you sure you're
not just being paranoid?

45:26.257 --> 45:27.990
No, far from it.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.496
Find Mr. Lear,
tell him I'll meet

45:33.498 --> 45:35.298
him in my office in an hour.

46:04.228 --> 46:05.161
Goddamn it.

46:07.464 --> 46:09.932
I've met a lot
of men like you,

46:09.934 --> 46:12.535
but they never lay down roots.

46:12.537 --> 46:17.774
Ms. Chavo, I'm certain
you've never met a man like me.

46:17.776 --> 46:20.910
You see, I have hopes,
dreams, aspirations.

46:20.912 --> 46:22.779
I have a vision for the future.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.059
Have you ever
used one of these?

46:39.830 --> 46:41.898
I can't say that I have.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.900
It was the preferred
close combat weapon

46:43.902 --> 46:47.069
on earth for nearly 2000 years.

46:47.071 --> 46:49.272
Could you imagine?

46:49.274 --> 46:52.942
Perfect heft, balance--

46:52.944 --> 46:54.844
I could slice someone
clean through.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.351
I wonder what's for dessert.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.099
Gage!

47:17.101 --> 47:18.100
Gage!

47:36.119 --> 47:39.088
Hey, here.

47:54.071 --> 47:56.405
And that's the
entrance right there.

47:56.407 --> 47:58.908
Good morning.

47:58.910 --> 48:00.977
He has something
to say to you.

48:00.979 --> 48:01.878
Go ahead.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.616
I apologize.

48:06.618 --> 48:08.117
Apology accepted.

48:08.119 --> 48:09.919
Good, done.

48:09.921 --> 48:12.154
Well, that was some evening.

48:12.156 --> 48:13.656
Very exciting.

48:13.658 --> 48:17.426
Anything to do with that
abandoned silver mine

48:17.428 --> 48:19.362
eight clicks east from here?

48:19.364 --> 48:23.532
I was out for a ride the
other night and there it was.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.368
That's when I knew why
you guys were here.

48:25.370 --> 48:27.904
Smart move.

48:27.906 --> 48:29.639
But hey, it's none
of my business.

48:38.148 --> 48:39.048
Have a seat.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.292
There are some
open silver mines.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.928
Must have been active
before the cloud fell.

48:51.930 --> 48:54.997
And they're right there,
ripe for the picking.

48:54.999 --> 48:56.599
So why not start digging?

48:56.601 --> 49:00.970
Those old excavators
are out of commission,

49:00.972 --> 49:07.710
can protect our interests from
attack like the other night.

49:07.712 --> 49:12.481
from some smaller settlements,
but it won't be enough.

49:12.483 --> 49:16.085
However, Mr. Lear--

49:16.087 --> 49:18.054
For the last three
weeks, a group of pilgrims

49:18.056 --> 49:20.389
have been traveling
across the plains.

49:20.391 --> 49:24.460
On their route tomorrow, they're
going to hit a brickyard.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.429
It's the perfect
place to snatch 'em.

49:26.431 --> 49:28.564
But it won't be easy.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.633
These pilgrims are
getting smarter.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.435
Once word gets out
that we have an almost

49:32.437 --> 49:35.471
unlimited supply
of silver, everyone

49:35.473 --> 49:36.706
will be gunning for us.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.012
So let's make it your business.

49:43.014 --> 49:45.314
I'm prepared to cut you
in as a token of my thanks

49:45.316 --> 49:47.283
for that night.

49:47.285 --> 49:50.486
One of your considerable talents
could prove very useful to us.

49:50.488 --> 49:51.988
Isn't that right, Mr. Lear?

49:53.590 --> 49:54.523
Sure.

49:57.160 --> 50:01.664
Well, I'm flattered, but I'm
not sticking around that long.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.133
You keep saying that,
but you're still here.

50:07.604 --> 50:09.138
Best of luck, gentlemen.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.276
5%.

50:17.414 --> 50:19.382
20%.

50:19.384 --> 50:20.516
Mm-- now we're negotiating.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.051
This is exciting.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.420
Never pegged you for greedy.

50:24.422 --> 50:26.022
Would you accept 10%?

50:29.793 --> 50:33.162
No, but I'd do it for 15%.

50:39.669 --> 50:42.038
Oh, this is exciting.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.473
Let's break out the good
stuff, the real stuff.

51:04.094 --> 51:05.728
Ah!

51:18.442 --> 51:21.110
Gage!

51:21.112 --> 51:23.746
Gage!

51:27.451 --> 51:30.319
A toast to new friends.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.509
Hi, you wanted to see me?

51:53.511 --> 51:57.780
Look, Melena, I've seen
the way Jackson treats you

51:57.782 --> 51:59.748
and you need to get as
far away from this place

51:59.750 --> 52:01.117
as you possibly can.

52:05.288 --> 52:09.391
This scarf is the only thing
I have left from my other life.

52:11.795 --> 52:15.664
I wanted to give it
to you to thank you.

52:15.666 --> 52:18.534
What do you have
to thank me for?

52:18.536 --> 52:21.370
You're the only person here
who doesn't treat me like I'm

52:21.372 --> 52:24.507
someone else's property.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.276
What is it?

52:27.278 --> 52:31.413
Mr. Jackson
says it's time to go.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.448
I have to go.

52:49.299 --> 52:50.366
They're coming.

52:55.605 --> 52:57.740
What is that?

52:57.742 --> 52:59.909
Told you it wasn't
going to be easy.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.684
No!

54:14.517 --> 54:17.486
Well, obviously we need
to take the turret out.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.521
Suggestions?

54:19.523 --> 54:21.490
Where the
hell are you going?

54:55.692 --> 54:57.426
Where is she?

55:41.905 --> 55:45.607
Oh, that took care of that.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.112
Round 'em up.

56:28.618 --> 56:30.986
Get your ass
in there right now.

56:45.668 --> 56:47.903
Credit where credit's due.

56:47.905 --> 56:50.706
Well, I have a
vested interest now.

56:55.078 --> 56:57.413
Keep your mouth
shut and be patient.

57:06.457 --> 57:09.725
This is just the beginning.

57:09.727 --> 57:13.529
Once that silver starts to roll
in, everyone in the territory

57:13.531 --> 57:17.499
will be crawling to us to
recharge their filters.

57:20.703 --> 57:25.207
I have the Sheriff of New
Montana dangling from my gates.

57:25.209 --> 57:28.143
If we need more people, we
know where to find them.

57:28.145 --> 57:30.012
We will rule this territory.

57:32.982 --> 57:36.185
Ah, that's disappointing.

57:36.187 --> 57:40.122
Thank you, Ms. Chavo.

57:40.124 --> 57:43.025
Serenade us, my dear.

57:43.027 --> 57:46.061
I'm OK.

57:52.235 --> 57:58.040
Love is a
madness, I can't get away.

57:58.042 --> 58:01.977
It hurts me to love you,
and it hurts me to stay.

58:01.979 --> 58:09.084
This sweet sadness is this all
I get for picking the dark horse

58:09.086 --> 58:10.486
and placing my bet.

58:13.490 --> 58:17.726
Well, if I can't
make you love me,

58:17.728 --> 58:23.265
and if I can't make
you pretend, no, no, I

58:23.267 --> 58:27.503
can't make you want
me, baby, then there's

58:27.505 --> 58:30.772
nothing else to recommend.

58:30.774 --> 58:32.841
I guess it has to end.

58:37.014 --> 58:42.985
Hey, I wanted to
give this back to you.

58:42.987 --> 58:45.654
No, I want you to have it.

58:45.656 --> 58:46.555
Please keep it.

58:49.559 --> 58:51.226
Well--

58:51.228 --> 58:55.130
Listen, you need to
get out of town tonight.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.165
Why?

58:57.167 --> 58:58.200
I'm not Chavo.

58:58.202 --> 59:00.536
I'm a bounty hunter.

59:00.538 --> 59:02.070
And I'm not here
to join Jackson,

59:02.072 --> 59:04.940
I'm here to take him in.

59:04.942 --> 59:07.309
Where am I supposed to go?

59:07.311 --> 59:08.911
Head to New Montana.

59:08.913 --> 59:10.579
It's a better way of life.

59:49.320 --> 59:53.755
should I take him
in dead or alive?

59:53.757 --> 59:55.624
If I didn't have to
drag your sorry carcass

59:55.626 --> 59:59.194
all the way across the
territory, trust me,

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.964
you'd already be dead.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:07.102
Bounty hunter, huh.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.870
So where's Chavo then?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.306
Dead, I assume.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:14.042
You've done better than most
of 'em, I'll give you that.

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:18.714
Not many can do that.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.949
I really thought we
understood each other.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.652
Well, then you're a bigger
fool than your sidekick.

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.624
OK, let's think this
through, shall we?

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.926
You take me in, they pay
you a nice huge bounty.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:36.732
trying to chase down the next
big fossil abuser, getting

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:40.135
black lung in the wilderness.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:45.307
Or, you stay here,
join me 50/50 partners.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.909
What do you say?

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.178
Is that your sales pitch?

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.880
Could use some work.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.757
The thing is, this
isn't about the bounty.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:03.358
It's personal.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.161
Try anything and I'll kill you.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.411
I'm a light sleeper.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:29.051
See, I knew there was
something off about you.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:31.153
Guess I was right, huh?

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:41.096
I'm might have to start
listening to you more often,

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:43.865
Mr. Lear.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.866
How did you know?

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.007
Remember me?

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.077
Womack.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.816
Thanks for tipping me off.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.197
Untie me, sweetheart.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:17.899
I'd like to have my
hands free for this.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:33.448
Now, what is with
all the hatred?

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:39.321
You killed my sister.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:40.889
Your sister?

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:42.424
When was this?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.292
Down South.

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:48.463
Ah, well, down south
was a long time ago.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.065
How do you know it was me?

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:52.033
That scar on your arm?

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:54.970
That's where she bit you.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:03:00.308
Oh I get it now.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:04.913
Right, let's string
her up in the pallet.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:09.785
Wait, if you wouldn't
mind, Mr. Jackson,

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.920
I've got a better idea.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:14.122
I know exactly what
to do with her.

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.886
Bring her back to
me in one piece--

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:49.224
the truck, not
the bounty hunter.

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:51.259
And make sure she's dead.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.961
Are we clear?

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:54.863
You won't have to
worry about that.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:13.849
You ready for a
little road trip, Gage?

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.933
Damn it.

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.677
Just a minor
technical glitch, Gage.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.146
We'll be back on
the road in no time.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.149
Oh.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.355
You know it was
never personal, Womack.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.190
You know that, right?

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:33.061
Personally, I'm enjoying
the hell out of this.

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:36.164
All right, listen,
we can make a deal.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:39.968
I know where Jackson's got
more tabs and silver than you

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.603
can use in three lifetimes.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.451
I'm not intrigued.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.619
You paused.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.120
I did not pause.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:04.392
and I am not intrigued, OK?

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.228
Damn it, listen.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.264
Before long, there
won't be a free person

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:12.634
in this entire territory,
including you, Womack.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.337
That doesn't concern
either of us anymore, Gage.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:18.573
You're about to die and I've got
the black lung, thanks to you.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.685
Wait a second.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:59.280
On second thought, Gage,
this is where I drop you off,

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:00.348
literally.

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:09.557
What are you doing, Womack?

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:10.792
Slight change of plans, Gage.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.460
You're going to love this.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:21.036
Hey, hey, Womack,
think about it.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.604
Whatever you're doing,
you think about.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:26.241
Think twice.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.475
Going down.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.410
Ah!

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.496
Breathe, Gage,
come on, damn it.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.564
Come on, breathe.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:39.908
Come on, breathe.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.551
That's it.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.319
Cough it up.

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.188
Keep coughing.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.221
Cough it up.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.490
Keep coughing.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:58.693
Doing
good, that's it.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:09:59.794
Get it all up.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:01.462
Keep it coming up.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:03.965
Yeah?

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.767
Come on.

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.823
Am I dead?

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.425
Not anymore.

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:43.498
I thought maybe you were the
ugliest angel I'd ever seen.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.004
I don't even know
how I got here.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:52.674
Yeah, just take it easy.

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:55.410
They did quite a number on you.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.512
Get some rest, OK?

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.019
Doc?

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:05.953
Yeah?

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.324
Thanks.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.962
You're not going soft, are ya?

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:50.565
I wasn't sure I was going
to see another one of these.

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:51.566
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.771
My dad used to say the
sunsets weren't near so

01:12:56.773 --> 01:13:00.508
pretty before the cloud fell.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.043
Kind of ironic.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.055
I really thought I
could bring him in alive.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:17.392
I keep saying, at
least you got out.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:20.628
They probably think
you're dead, so they

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.130
won't be gunning for ya.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.869
I'm going back.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:31.572
At some point, your
luck's going to run out.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.809
He killed Beatrice.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:37.512
What makes you so sure?

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:40.448
He's got a scar on his
arm where she bit him.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:44.085
Besides, he's coming here next.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:46.587
Why bother with New Montana?

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.956
He found a silver mine.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:51.692
He's going to need
hands to work it.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:54.162
He'll be running this
territory in no time.

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:58.466
Well, I'm coming with you.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:00.067
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:01.869
Oh, you don't think
that's a good idea?

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:03.704
Do you know what I
think about you not

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:05.840
thinking that's a good idea?

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:07.708
I think you're coming anyway.

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:08.743
I think you're right.

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:55.216
Well, look who's back.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:58.152
How many men did you say he had?

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:01.289
He lost five taking
the pilgrims,

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:03.224
but I'm sure Womack stayed.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.158
So 12.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.329
Well, all we need now is
the element of surprise.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:34.188
Take these masks.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.724
Here's the map,
head to New Montana.

01:16:36.726 --> 01:16:39.126
The people there will
take care of you.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:41.796
Thank you.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.761
You Tom Jackson?

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:49.397
No, what you want?

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:53.134
Well, I think someone from
here has misplaced this,

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:55.236
figured I'd return it.

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:56.771
He's the man in charge, right?

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:57.705
Jackson?

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:00.941
Wait here.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.947
Getting kind of
crowded out here.

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.353
What the hell is this?

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.896
Where'd you say
you found this?

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:24.699
You Jackson?

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:27.168
On the edge of the Wastelands.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:29.737
Followed the tracks, led here.

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:30.471
Hm.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:36.110
I thought you said
you finished her off?

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:38.245
I pushed her off the ravine.

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:41.015
I watched that
thing smash to bits.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:45.953
There's no way she survived.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:49.857
There's only one
way to find out.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.140
Satisfied?

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.859
She is full of surprises.

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:28.162
How did you--

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.878
How many's that?

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.912
I counted seven.

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:45.780
Five more.

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.783
Son of a bitch.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:57.124
The mine-- if it was me,
I'd be going after the silver

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.093
stash while they stall us.

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:03.097
I'm going out there.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.572
Cover me.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:13.073
Go!

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.610
You don't know
when to quit, do ya?

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:13.694
You know how to
drive one of these?

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:14.695
Not really.

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:19.066
Push that down
as hard as you can.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:21.101
Point this in the
direction of New Montana.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.269
Don't stop for anyone.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.237
Here.

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:29.209
Three.

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:33.213
Go!

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:39.153
Ah!

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:40.521
Two.

01:22:40.523 --> 01:22:42.122
One.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.058
Zero.

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:53.500
Think we're good?

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.202
I'm going after Jackson.

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:57.104
I know where to find him.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:58.005
Go.

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.046
Gah.

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:57.398
What kind of coward shoots
a cripple in the back?

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.665
You should have
walked away when

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.801
you had the chance, old man.

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.407
I'm not much good
at walking away.

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:09.176
I never was.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.518
It's time to pay for
what you've done, Jackson.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.687
Is this still about
that little scar?

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:22.790
I have a lot of
scars, sweetheart,

01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:26.760
but you can't go holding
grudges in this world.

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:28.595
I think perhaps
I'm just an outlet

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:30.764
for all this misplaced rage.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:32.399
Did you read
that in a book too?

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:35.069
I did, actually--
clinical psychology.

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:39.239
Oh, they'd have a
field day with you.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.177
Look, I don't know what you're
trying to accomplish here,

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:46.413
Well, as long as you're
dead, I don't really care.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.415
I can see that
your mind is made up.

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.189
Shall we begin?

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.296
You having fun?

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.120
Wait, wait, wait--

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:32.426
It's over.

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:34.528
Your crew's all dead.

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:41.902
I don't suppose there's
a doctor around here?

01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:44.638
Our team medic is face
down in the dirt over there,

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.774
so you're shit out of luck.

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:52.546
Do you mind if
I drink of water?

01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:55.349
You go on ahead.

01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:58.352
It's going to be the last
thing you'll ever do.

01:25:58.354 --> 01:26:00.554
Ha, that's funny.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:18.372
Hey, Gage, ever hear
of a military tactic

01:26:18.374 --> 01:26:21.308
called scorched earth policy?

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:23.477
You know, we could
have made a great team.

01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:30.951
With my ruthless efficiency and
your stubborn refusal to die.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.867
Chavo says goodbye.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:48.602
No, no, no, no, no, Gage!

01:26:48.604 --> 01:26:49.603
Gage!

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:30.544
Doc!

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.018
Doc.

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:44.925
You're the ugliest
angel I ever saw.

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:49.663
Is he dead?

01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:51.465
Yeah.

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.367
Can we get out of here?

01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:55.002
Give me a second.

01:27:55.004 --> 01:27:58.372
I'm going to cut these
poor bastards down.

01:27:58.374 --> 01:28:00.974
Yeah.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.687
You OK?

01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:15.689
Yeah.

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:17.924
I feel like one
of your bounties.

01:28:17.926 --> 01:28:21.028
Trouble is, I'm not worth much.

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:22.729
To me, you are.

01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:23.597
What was that?

01:28:23.599 --> 01:28:26.066
Did you say I was to you?

01:28:26.068 --> 01:28:27.467
No.

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:29.603
You did, I heard you.

01:28:29.605 --> 01:28:31.805
Well, then you're
hearing things.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.740
You are going soft.

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:35.375
I knew it.

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:38.445
Try to sleep.

01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:40.447
You definitely said it.

01:28:40.449 --> 01:28:43.850
I did not say it.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:51.925
Saw the devil
on a one-way street.

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:56.563
He was checking out
my wanderin' feet.

01:28:56.565 --> 01:29:00.334
Didn't speak, didn't
make no sound--

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:05.005
he said, get yourself
New Montana bound.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:11.578
Going home-- I catch
a flamin' stone.

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:20.921
Going home-- cutting
deep and high,

01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:28.795
watch my grief tumbling
out of the sky,

01:29:28.797 --> 01:29:31.064
tumbling out of the sky.
