19:58.764 --> 20:00.339
Multiple noise complaints?

20:00.374 --> 20:02.349
Grandpa's
not-so-secret recipe?

20:02.427 --> 20:03.242
That's us.

20:03.277 --> 20:05.143
What can I do for you?

20:05.221 --> 20:07.629
We need to file
a missing persons report.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.973
Our daughter,
she didn't make it home

20:09.050 --> 20:10.832
Last night
from a party.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.609
Okay. [sighs]

20:12.687 --> 20:13.753
I need you to fill this out.

20:13.788 --> 20:16.004
Please. This is an emergency.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.714
How old is she?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.032
16.

20:19.110 --> 20:21.051
Last night
was only a few hours ago.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.262
You try calling her?
Call her friends? Boyfriend?

20:23.297 --> 20:24.679
-Yeah.
-We've called everyone.

20:24.681 --> 20:25.798
No one's seen her.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.732
It's barely 10:00 a.M.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.458
I'm sure
you haven't called everyone.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.876
Didn't you folks
just move here?

20:29.954 --> 20:31.487
Officer, she's a minor.

20:31.489 --> 20:33.648
Yeah, but not a "minor" minor.

20:34.658 --> 20:35.991
Look.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.810
If your daughter
were, say, five,

20:37.886 --> 20:39.403
And ran off
in the middle of the night,

20:39.405 --> 20:40.229
I'd be worried,

20:40.264 --> 20:41.263
But I've been doing this

20:41.341 --> 20:43.056
For nearly as long
as she's been alive,

20:43.134 --> 20:44.574
And this happens
all the time.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.744
Parents panic,
they file a report,

20:47.746 --> 20:48.988
And in a few hours,

20:49.064 --> 20:50.672
He or she is found
at a friend's house

20:50.749 --> 20:52.291
Or the movies or some such,
which means

20:52.326 --> 20:54.126
The precious resources
of the police department

20:54.236 --> 20:57.672
Have been wasted on what we call
a "mistaken report".

20:58.757 --> 21:00.824
It's a drain on our budget.

21:00.902 --> 21:02.751
So you won't help us?

21:03.579 --> 21:06.688
99% of cases resolve themselves
within 24 hours.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.307
If you haven't found her
by then,

21:08.342 --> 21:09.358
We'll issue an apb

21:09.435 --> 21:10.659
And get the whole department
on it.

21:10.694 --> 21:12.186
Until then,
I can't help you.

21:16.350 --> 21:17.257
Look.

21:17.368 --> 21:20.119
I'm sure if you two
put your heads together,

21:20.195 --> 21:22.346
There are half a dozen places
you haven't looked,

21:22.423 --> 21:24.699
And that's where
she'll probably be.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.827
-Thank you, officer.
-Yeah, thank you.

21:28.971 --> 21:31.163
[whimpering and sobbing]

21:34.885 --> 21:36.969

21:37.045 --> 21:38.629

21:38.706 --> 21:40.672
Let's be civilized.

21:40.674 --> 21:41.966

21:43.135 --> 21:45.227
No.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.029
[sighs]

21:47.064 --> 21:49.473
This... Can go rough,

21:49.475 --> 21:50.716
Or this can go smooth.

21:50.793 --> 21:52.368
Your choice.

21:52.403 --> 21:53.477

21:53.479 --> 21:55.563

21:57.058 --> 21:58.298

21:58.376 --> 22:00.443
Just want to talk to you.

22:04.799 --> 22:06.657
Good girl.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.036
[shakily] where am I?

22:10.071 --> 22:12.404
You are in the house.

22:12.481 --> 22:13.697
Whose house?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.499
My house.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.000
I'm ron, by the way.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.410
It's good to meet you.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.821
[sobs] I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

22:20.823 --> 22:22.581
I'm not supposed to be here.

22:22.658 --> 22:25.467
I-I really, really
need to go home.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.769
[calmly] you have
a little sister, right?

22:27.846 --> 22:28.829
Cadence, was it?

22:28.906 --> 22:30.847
[breath catches]

22:30.849 --> 22:32.516
How did you know that?

22:32.518 --> 22:34.060
You told lori.
Lori told me.

22:34.095 --> 22:36.428
A regular little chatterbox,
aren't ya?

22:36.505 --> 22:39.565
See, now,
if I let you go...

22:39.600 --> 22:42.284
I might have to go
grab cadence.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.753
Do you want me to do that?

22:44.788 --> 22:45.787
No.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.739
Good.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.449
I just think

22:49.451 --> 22:51.460
That there's been
some kind of mistake.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.412
No. No mistake.

22:53.522 --> 22:55.355
You went out
looking for trouble.

22:55.466 --> 22:56.949
No! No, I didn't.
I didn't. I didn't.

22:57.025 --> 22:58.967
Dressed like that?
Yeah, you did.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.043
[sobbing] no, I--

23:00.045 --> 23:02.004
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

23:02.940 --> 23:05.198
Right now, you need
to just sit and listen.

23:05.276 --> 23:06.366
Can you do that?

23:06.477 --> 23:08.143
Yes.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.445
Good.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.446
I...

23:10.481 --> 23:12.055
Am a businessman.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.815
That's it.
That's what I do.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.768
This is not a prison,
it's a business,

23:15.803 --> 23:16.985
And you...

23:17.062 --> 23:19.288
Are a valued employee--
an investment.

23:19.323 --> 23:21.064
I have five other girls

23:21.066 --> 23:22.991
Who are also
valued employees.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.476
They come and go
as they like.

23:24.553 --> 23:26.112
They make money,
they have privileges.

23:26.114 --> 23:28.631
You are no different
than any of them.

23:28.666 --> 23:30.390
But...

23:30.468 --> 23:32.484
But you...

23:32.561 --> 23:34.987
But you locked me in here.

23:35.063 --> 23:36.171
[crying]

23:36.248 --> 23:39.458
Because you and I
have not established trust.

23:39.493 --> 23:41.084
You do what you're told,
keep your mouth shut,

23:41.086 --> 23:42.068
Earn your keep,

23:42.146 --> 23:43.679
We won't have a problem.

23:43.681 --> 23:46.923
If you can't do those things...
Well, it's very simple.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.151
What do I have to do?

23:49.186 --> 23:52.321
Well, you want to act grown.

23:52.356 --> 23:53.973
What we do here...

23:55.601 --> 23:57.935

I just can't believe it.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.618
Where is she?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.804
We'll find her.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.879

24:17.956 --> 24:20.357
The cops,
they won't help us.

24:20.434 --> 24:21.867
They never help us.

24:21.944 --> 24:23.385
I mean, a little black girl
goes missing

24:23.462 --> 24:25.045
And they assume that it's drugs
or that she ran away.

24:26.357 --> 24:28.448
[exhales deeply] ohh...

You can keep that.

You know, because the cameras

They come back down

Were just fine
the last time I saw her.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.021
If you were "just fine,"
why did she sneak out?

31:23.056 --> 31:24.840
I don't know!
I mean, that's...

31:24.875 --> 31:26.132

Is that what they do?

31:27.628 --> 31:28.643
It's what you did.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.220
I hope to god
she's mad at us, d.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.890
Why would you want her
to be mad at us?

31:32.966 --> 31:33.891
Because if she isn't,

31:33.967 --> 31:35.650
Then somebody...

31:35.685 --> 31:36.818
Then somebody's got her.

47:25.935 --> 47:27.843
It could've been

47:27.845 --> 47:29.236
They could've moved her

How is this even legal?

47:39.356 --> 47:42.400
These pictures, I mean--
this-this can't even be legal.

47:42.435 --> 47:44.176

she's clearly a child.

-If alicia ran away from home--
-wait, wait!

47:46.138 --> 47:47.788

that makes any damn sense!

47:54.188 --> 47:55.020
I'd agree,

47:55.098 --> 47:56.213
Which means
someone took the time

47:56.290 --> 47:57.164
To snatch her off the street,

47:57.199 --> 47:58.349
Take these photos,

48:28.497 --> 48:29.647
[pfeiffer] we need resources.

48:29.723 --> 48:32.057
There could be a drug ring
connected to it.

48:32.135 --> 48:34.409
There could be girls
coming in from out of state,

48:34.411 --> 48:36.754

along to the feds.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.270
Why is it taking so long
for them to do their job?

49:45.482 --> 49:47.799
It has been weeks,

because I might make it worse.

51:22.847 --> 51:23.621
[curtis] babe, we agreed

51:23.790 --> 51:25.806
To step back
and let the cops do their job.

51:25.841 --> 51:26.932
Yeah, but for how long?

51:27.009 --> 51:28.900
And when have the cops
ever done their job for us?

51:28.978 --> 51:31.312
We're just regular folks, d.

51:31.347 --> 51:32.996
Yeah, I know,

And she's afraid,
and she's-she's scared.

51:37.820 --> 51:40.721
I heard a man
beating on her!

51:41.757 --> 51:44.099
We can do this.
We can do this.

All we have to do is we call

Just like the ad says.

51:51.533 --> 51:52.566
That's all we gotta do.

What if we blow it?
What if we make things worse?

51:55.028 --> 51:55.927
I mean, what if

51:56.038 --> 51:57.629
Alicia gets hurt,
I mean, if alicia gets hurt--

51:57.706 --> 51:59.506
I can't wait anymore.
I can't.

51:59.541 --> 52:01.600
I-I...

52:01.677 --> 52:02.934
I just know--

52:03.012 --> 52:04.211
Let me--
let me think about it.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.287
I gotta get to work.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.847
Okay, well, you do that.

52:06.882 --> 52:09.107
And while
you're out there working,

52:09.185 --> 52:11.118
You think about
our little girl...

52:11.153 --> 52:12.219
"working".

52:12.296 --> 52:13.337
Don't.

52:13.372 --> 52:15.797
And then you tell me,
how do we just sit here

52:15.799 --> 52:16.924
And wait for the cops?

52:18.878 --> 52:20.544
Please.

52:20.546 --> 52:24.056
Please.
I need you with me on this.

What are you doing?

52:41.800 --> 52:43.583
I've been calling

53:24.994 --> 53:26.618
I've been meaning
to call her back.

53:26.620 --> 53:29.129
It's just that things have been
really busy around here.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.280
With our case?

53:30.357 --> 53:33.767
Operations like this
can take months,

-Years even.
-Years?

better news for you.

53:44.204 --> 53:46.447

You know
I appreciate you.

53:48.558 --> 53:50.100
I respect you.

53:50.135 --> 53:51.952
A part of me is just...

53:51.987 --> 53:54.638
It was my idea to move here.

53:54.715 --> 53:56.974
I wasn't even home
the night she was taken.

53:57.050 --> 53:58.733
So you tell me what y--

53:58.735 --> 54:00.653
Just wait,

Over the state line,

56:50.666 --> 56:53.367
But I guess
I needed a fix.

I guess ron had
some people lookin' for me,

Because he caught up with me,

She didn't really answer
a lot of our questions,

01:01:37.269 --> 01:01:39.920
So we'll have her back
in a few weeks

01:01:39.955 --> 01:01:41.922
Just when she's in
a better head space.

01:01:41.957 --> 01:01:43.790
These are
some resources for you.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.717
I know you found
the support group helpful.

01:01:45.794 --> 01:01:46.868
Counseling is recommended--

01:01:46.945 --> 01:01:49.763
Not just for alicia,
but for the family as well.

01:01:49.798 --> 01:01:51.723
Well, we will read through
all of the information.

But she's smart,
she's strong,

01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:55.526
She's got a family

01:01:55.604 --> 01:01:56.786
That'll be with her
every step of the way.

We're gonna take it slow,

[crying out]
ron, where are you?

01:18:20.938 --> 01:18:22.171
[officer] we got her.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.039
-Princess, don't say anything!
-First floor's clear.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.274
[lori] you have the right
to remain silent!

01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:28.210

01:18:33.025 --> 01:18:35.050
She's at fresh start.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:38.454
It's an addiction and trauma
treatment center.

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:40.456
Is she okay?

01:18:40.532 --> 01:18:42.091

01:18:42.126 --> 01:18:43.867

01:18:45.312 --> 01:18:47.512

should've gone there

we got her back.

01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:54.044

for her to get well.

01:18:54.121 --> 01:18:55.730

it could be a few months.

01:18:58.476 --> 01:19:00.818

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.149
Well, um...

01:19:07.226 --> 01:19:09.702
Your dad and I...

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.289
...We just need
a little bit of space right now.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.901

01:19:17.903 --> 01:19:19.419

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.662
I'm good.

01:19:20.739 --> 01:19:22.757
Okay.

01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:33.267

01:19:41.201 --> 01:19:42.526
What, mama?

01:19:48.275 --> 01:19:49.575
Proud of you.

01:19:50.435 --> 01:19:52.745

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.247
Your girls.

01:19:57.384 --> 01:19:59.184
I'm just...

01:19:59.219 --> 01:20:01.795
It doesn't feel like enough.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:04.222
I feel like I could do more.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.448
Then do it.

01:20:05.526 --> 01:20:07.860
I'll be right here...

01:20:07.895 --> 01:20:10.304

01:20:11.899 --> 01:20:13.048

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.867
Love you, baby girl.

01:20:14.902 --> 01:20:16.960
I love you, too, mommy.

01:20:17.038 --> 01:20:19.271
I don't know.

01:20:19.306 --> 01:20:21.023
I guess we just thought

01:20:21.058 --> 01:20:23.717
That we could love her
back to normal.

01:20:23.794 --> 01:20:26.237
Everyone thinks that.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.907
There's still
a piece of her missing...

01:20:30.809 --> 01:20:32.976
...And I don't know
if we'll ever get it back.

01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:35.812
That's what they did
to my baby girl.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:37.039
People need to know

01:20:37.074 --> 01:20:38.707
That this can happen
to anybody.

01:20:38.742 --> 01:20:39.875
Agreed.

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:43.045
How would you feel
about telling that to people?

01:20:44.081 --> 01:20:45.588
How do you mean?

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:46.999
Well, there's a fundraiser

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:48.408
For trafficked young women
coming up--

01:20:48.486 --> 01:20:51.511
Maybe you could speak,
tell your story.

01:21:10.624 --> 01:21:11.698

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:12.791
That was the morgue.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.536
They found a body,
and it might...

01:21:16.806 --> 01:21:20.282
...Might be my daughter.

01:21:20.434 --> 01:21:23.102
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.

01:21:23.137 --> 01:21:24.753

[sobs] no.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.363

[curtis]

01:22:56.121 --> 01:22:58.380
How do I make this right?

01:22:58.457 --> 01:23:00.457
In my support group,

01:23:00.534 --> 01:23:03.268
We talk a lot about guilt...

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:07.213
...How we shouldn't
absolve ourselves of it,

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:10.467
How we should feel it...

01:23:10.544 --> 01:23:12.027
Accept it,

01:23:12.062 --> 01:23:15.321
Learn,
and do better.

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:17.065
You should come sometime.

01:23:17.142 --> 01:23:18.984

talk about my feelings

01:23:18.986 --> 01:23:20.736
In front of
a bunch of strangers?

01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:22.412
I don't know
about all that.

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:23.914
I mean...

01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:27.342
I think it would help...

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.736
Us...

01:23:29.814 --> 01:23:32.439
And the family.

01:23:32.516 --> 01:23:34.967
Then I can make that happen.

01:23:37.254 --> 01:23:38.804
That's a good start.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:42.599
So what have you been doing

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:44.676
To keep yourself busy
these days?

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:47.028
I actually...

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:50.423

01:23:51.852 --> 01:23:54.452
-Yeah.

01:23:56.257 --> 01:23:58.073
And what happened to her.

01:23:58.108 --> 01:24:01.260
A lot of people
don't know that this happens,

01:24:01.295 --> 01:24:03.228
Even in safe neighborhoods.

01:24:03.305 --> 01:24:06.431
We sure didn't.

01:24:06.466 --> 01:24:08.292
Yeah.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.211
Oh, and...

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.880
I got the website
to take those photos down.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.175
Oh, look at you go!

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:18.260

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:22.056
Yeah.

01:24:32.676 --> 01:24:34.126
Quit!

01:24:34.161 --> 01:24:36.402
So when do you get out?

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.980
Oh... It'll be a minute.

01:24:39.057 --> 01:24:41.833
I mean, they said
I could be out in six weeks,

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.787
But I don't know, I think I--
I'll need a few more months.

01:24:44.822 --> 01:24:47.322
Mom, you're gonna
have to sign off on that.

01:24:47.399 --> 01:24:48.898
Of course. Of course.
Do you.

01:24:48.976 --> 01:24:51.210
You take as much time
as you need.

01:24:52.313 --> 01:24:53.587
[alicia] thank you, mom.

01:24:54.648 --> 01:24:57.174
Thank you all
for being here today.

01:24:58.485 --> 01:25:01.853
I would like to share my story,

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.164
My family's story,

01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:06.524
And make sure
that no family

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:09.085
Has to go through
what we went through.

01:25:09.163 --> 01:25:11.012
This is about awareness--

01:25:11.089 --> 01:25:13.865
About a problem
that I didn't even know existed

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.283
Until it happened

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.284
To us,

01:25:16.286 --> 01:25:18.353
To my daughter,
who's here today.

01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:22.507
Six months ago,
when she was just 16 years old,

01:25:22.542 --> 01:25:24.626
She was kidnapped.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:29.439
She was sexually trafficked
on upostpage.Com for months.

01:25:29.516 --> 01:25:31.716
What she had to experience
on a daily basis,

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.168
It is still unimaginable to me,

01:25:33.203 --> 01:25:34.552
And it would be unimaginable

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.271
To mostly everybody
in this room,

01:25:36.306 --> 01:25:37.138
But still,

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.857
It's when
my daughter was recovered

01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:40.208
And brought back home to us,

01:25:40.285 --> 01:25:41.860
That's when
I realized the full extent

01:25:41.895 --> 01:25:43.803
Of the trauma
that she had suffered,

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.730
The impact
that her suffering would have

01:25:45.732 --> 01:25:47.724
On my entire family.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.628
Child sex trafficking
is happening here.

01:25:51.705 --> 01:25:53.463
Prevention and awareness

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.882
Increases empathy
in our communities,

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.210
And helps children,
like my daughter,

01:25:58.245 --> 01:26:00.912
And families like ours,

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.249
In their greatest moment
of need.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.760
Real change has to happen

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:08.320
In order
to protect our children,

01:26:08.355 --> 01:26:09.812
In order to make sure

01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:12.915
That no child is sold
on upostpage.Com,

01:26:12.917 --> 01:26:14.910
Or anywhere else,
ever again.

01:26:14.986 --> 01:26:16.502
Together, we can do this.
