00:01.867 --> 00:03.819
<i>I answer the door and
it's these two guys,</i>

00:03.854 --> 00:05.586
and they're looking for Cece.

00:05.622 --> 00:07.155
I am over her.

00:07.191 --> 00:08.589
<i>I am fine.</i>

00:08.625 --> 00:10.258
This is my car!

00:10.294 --> 00:11.334
With what I know about her

00:11.361 --> 00:12.672
and what you guys know about her,

00:12.696 --> 00:14.507
we might just find a clue
to who she really is.

00:14.531 --> 00:16.865
Guys, St. Agnes Academy in Pottsville,
Pennsylvania.

00:16.900 --> 00:17.866
This was her school.

00:17.901 --> 00:19.234
Pottsville, here we come!

00:19.269 --> 00:20.400
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:20.436 --> 00:22.269
Meet Gary Heller, managing director

00:22.305 --> 00:23.838
<i>of the Pacific Bank and Trust.</i>

00:23.873 --> 00:25.706
<i>I'm supposed to fall
in love with this guy?</i>

00:25.741 --> 00:27.774
<i>His big hobby is darts.</i>

00:28.609 --> 00:29.409
My God!

00:29.445 --> 00:30.845
Gary is a pussy, okay.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.679
- Keep talking, Freddy.
- Jesus!

00:32.715 --> 00:34.392
Am I the only one who
thinks there's something off

00:34.416 --> 00:35.883
<i>about this job?</i>

00:35.918 --> 00:37.616
<i>The only thing off is Maddie's focus.</i>

00:37.652 --> 00:39.352
We're right on schedule.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.620
<i>I told you,
I'll close him tomorrow night.</i>

00:41.656 --> 00:42.922
- Gary...
- No.

00:42.958 --> 00:44.690
I don't want to rush things.

00:44.726 --> 00:45.847
<i>Kind of complicated.</i>

00:45.848 --> 00:47.526
<i>Some things can be pretty simple.</i>

00:47.562 --> 00:49.595
<i>All you have to do is be open.</i>

00:49.630 --> 00:51.397
I'm sorry, I just can't right now.

00:51.432 --> 00:52.966
<i>Is she getting distracted?</i>

00:53.001 --> 00:54.632
Maybe I should send Lenny Cohen.

00:56.303 --> 00:57.583
<i>There's no need for Lenny Cohen.</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:19.625 --> 01:21.458
Ready for the time of your life?

01:21.494 --> 01:23.895
I thought it was just lunch.

01:23.930 --> 01:26.230
You ready for the best
lunch of your life?

01:28.879 --> 01:30.833
So it's fourth down and 17, right.

01:30.869 --> 01:32.646
A minute left on the clock.
No time-outs left.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.415
- And you're down a field goal?
- No, sweetheart.

01:34.439 --> 01:35.605
We're down five.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.240
We have to get in the end zone.

01:37.276 --> 01:39.014
- Jesus.
- No kidding.

01:40.445 --> 01:42.279
No.

01:42.314 --> 01:44.347
Try the next one.

01:44.383 --> 01:46.949
Try another one.

01:53.857 --> 01:56.525
Wait, wait. Stop. Stop. Go back.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.760
There.

01:58.796 --> 02:01.297
Maddie Jonson.

02:01.332 --> 02:03.298
My God.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.934
So they send an A-gap blitz
and the guards break down.

02:05.969 --> 02:08.702
So I scramble to the left.

02:08.738 --> 02:10.972
I'm looking for a receiver,
but they're boxed in.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.474
I pump-fake once... defenders bite.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.044
I cut back right, and boom!

02:16.079 --> 02:17.079
<i>Daylight.</i>

02:22.684 --> 02:24.517
Are you sure this is it?

02:24.553 --> 02:27.449
It just looks so, like,
out of a horror movie.

02:27.484 --> 02:28.655
It has to be it.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.968
It's the only Jonsons
in the phone book...

02:29.992 --> 02:31.358
Arlen and Margaret.

02:31.393 --> 02:34.361
Maddie Jonson. That is so...

02:34.396 --> 02:36.528
Maddie Jonson.

02:36.564 --> 02:38.630
There's no "H" in Jonson.
I've never seen that.

02:38.666 --> 02:39.966
Maybe they couldn't afford it.

02:40.001 --> 02:41.733
Man, she grew up here.

02:41.769 --> 02:44.036
In this house. Played in that yard.

02:44.072 --> 02:46.016
Yeah, man, how do you grow up
in a place like this

02:46.040 --> 02:48.374
and become... her?

02:48.409 --> 02:50.009
Shh, shh, hey look.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.643
That's Maddie's mother.

02:51.679 --> 02:52.878
Yeah. I think you're right.

02:52.913 --> 02:55.480
She looks kind of sad to me.

02:55.515 --> 02:58.683
She looks sad.

03:04.024 --> 03:05.490
What about this one?

03:05.525 --> 03:07.825
You don't look anything like her.

03:07.861 --> 03:09.660
How about...

03:09.696 --> 03:10.894
her?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.429
I never looked anything like that.

03:12.465 --> 03:13.998
Well, life goal:

03:14.033 --> 03:15.543
"Move to New York and become famous."
That's good.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.368
My goal is not to become famous.

03:17.403 --> 03:19.536
- Right.
- I wanted to be successful,

03:19.571 --> 03:21.372
sure, respected and admired for my work,

03:21.407 --> 03:22.550
but that's not the same thing as famous.

03:22.574 --> 03:23.940
I think all Richard means

03:23.976 --> 03:25.087
is the less we have to make up,
the better.

03:25.111 --> 03:26.443
Yeah, so let it go.

03:26.479 --> 03:27.877
Your name is Jennifer Sherman.

03:27.912 --> 03:30.513
You were in the French club,
just like Maddie,

03:30.548 --> 03:32.548
and president of the
"no smoking" initiative.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.428
Yeah, but what if Jennifer
Sherman still lives here,

03:34.452 --> 03:36.852
- or she's dead, or...
- Jenny, it's called research.

03:36.888 --> 03:38.032
That's why God invented Facebook.

03:38.056 --> 03:40.023
This guy... she's pulling in.

03:45.569 --> 03:49.364
Looks like salon day for Mrs. J.

03:52.069 --> 03:53.601
Okay.

03:53.637 --> 03:55.870
Let's make a plan.

03:59.609 --> 04:01.708
So, question.

04:03.446 --> 04:05.413
Why banking?

04:05.448 --> 04:06.547
It's a living,

04:06.582 --> 04:07.822
and there are banks everywhere,

04:07.850 --> 04:11.385
so I could just pick up and go
every couple years, if I wanted.

04:11.421 --> 04:14.422
Yeah, but why would such a smart,

04:14.457 --> 04:16.957
beautiful woman always feel the need

04:16.992 --> 04:18.624
- to keep moving?
- Who knows?

04:18.660 --> 04:20.559
Maybe I'm running from something.

04:23.932 --> 04:25.932
But seriously, don't you get lonely?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.935
Always meeting people and then...

04:28.970 --> 04:30.570
- moving on?
- Sometimes,

04:30.605 --> 04:32.638
but just because something's temporary

04:32.674 --> 04:34.907
doesn't mean it's not real.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.010
Can I ask you a question?

04:39.046 --> 04:41.180
Anything.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.681
Is it weird to not have to work?

04:42.716 --> 04:44.649
Well, I do have to work.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.085
Your story's changing.

04:46.362 --> 04:47.119
Well, wait, wait, wait.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.587
Let me rephrase.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.855
I'm not compelled financially to work...

04:51.892 --> 04:53.524
But I have to work.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.959
You know, I like to work, really.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.161
Do things, learn things.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.963
You know, I'm not great with idle time.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.164
Really?

05:00.200 --> 05:03.201
Family barbecues, fancy lunches

05:03.236 --> 05:04.668
with new pals...

05:04.704 --> 05:06.770
Seems to me like you got it down, buddy.

05:08.874 --> 05:10.773
Well, maybe. Maybe,

05:10.809 --> 05:13.876
but I don't get to kiss my new pal.

05:13.912 --> 05:15.979
Well, you can't have it all.

05:16.014 --> 05:17.680
No, apparently not.

05:21.179 --> 05:24.687
- So what kind of feeling?
- I don't know.

05:24.723 --> 05:27.990
But it's just, like the...
It's all gone to crap.

05:28.025 --> 05:30.058
Older people often feel that way, Meg.

05:30.094 --> 05:31.727
I'm not an "older people."

05:31.762 --> 05:33.795
Young people, they just see a world

05:33.831 --> 05:36.465
that is exciting and they
can't wait to figure it out.

05:36.501 --> 05:39.635
So they go and get tattoos
and go on adventures.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.802
Excuse me.

05:40.838 --> 05:42.171
Mrs. Jonson?

05:42.206 --> 05:43.871
Maddie's mom?

05:43.906 --> 05:45.473
Well, could be.

05:45.509 --> 05:46.474
And who are you?

05:46.510 --> 05:48.243
Jenny Sherman.

05:48.278 --> 05:50.878
I was in Maddie's year at St. Agnes.

05:50.913 --> 05:53.714
We were in French club.
We used to walk home together.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.216
My.

05:55.252 --> 05:58.153
You're Kelly Sherman's daughter,
aren't you?

05:58.188 --> 06:00.087
Yes, I am.

06:00.123 --> 06:01.866
That was such a terrible
thing with your mother.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.190
I am so sorry.

06:03.225 --> 06:04.891
What... what happened with your mother?

06:04.926 --> 06:08.862
W-was it cancer, or a car?
I-I can't remember.

06:08.897 --> 06:10.164
Honey.

06:10.199 --> 06:13.066
You do not need
to talk about this, okay?

06:13.101 --> 06:14.834
Margaret, really.

06:14.870 --> 06:17.703
- So how is Maddie?
- She's busy.

06:17.738 --> 06:19.238
Very busy. Barbara, can you finish?

06:19.274 --> 06:20.706
How much longer?

06:20.741 --> 06:21.752
Okay, thanks so much for your help.

06:21.776 --> 06:22.853
I appreciate it. All right.

06:22.877 --> 06:24.577
Jen, not good news.

06:24.612 --> 06:26.089
The visas won't be ready
until the day after tomorrow,

06:26.113 --> 06:27.680
so it looks like we're...

06:27.715 --> 06:29.182
Excuse me, ladies.

06:29.217 --> 06:30.616
I'm sorry for interrupting.

06:30.652 --> 06:32.051
This is my husband, Channing.

06:32.086 --> 06:33.852
Channing, this is Mrs. Jonson.

06:33.888 --> 06:35.898
Her daughter Maddie and I
went to high school together.

06:35.922 --> 06:36.922
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:36.956 --> 06:38.856
- Hi. Hello.
- Evan.

06:38.892 --> 06:41.059
That's your brother's name, right?

06:41.094 --> 06:43.000
What's he up to?

06:45.632 --> 06:48.032
Evan is still living with
his girlfriend in Florida.

06:48.068 --> 06:49.301
West coast.

06:49.336 --> 06:51.069
He posts some gorgeous
photos on Facebook.

06:51.104 --> 06:53.237
So are... are you
from around here, Channing?

06:53.272 --> 06:54.871
I wish, but no.

06:54.907 --> 06:56.807
We were actually supposed
to fly to Havana today

06:56.842 --> 06:58.642
for a business conference.

06:58.678 --> 07:00.744
Got waylaid with some visa issues.

07:00.779 --> 07:03.747
So looks like we're gonna be
stuck here for 36 hours or so.

07:03.782 --> 07:05.716
I got us a room at the
Shady Lane Inn tonight.

07:05.751 --> 07:08.718
A little room with a twin bed.

07:08.753 --> 07:11.053
Why don't you have them over for lunch?

07:11.089 --> 07:13.122
You know, you can all talk
about the old days.

07:13.157 --> 07:14.757
- That is so sweet of you...
- No.

07:14.792 --> 07:15.803
We wouldn't want to be an inconvenience.

07:15.827 --> 07:16.992
It'd be very good for you.

07:17.028 --> 07:20.062
Her Arlen has been not well.

07:20.243 --> 07:21.130
Not well?

07:21.165 --> 07:22.847
That's one way to put it.

07:27.338 --> 07:28.937
Come over and...

07:28.972 --> 07:30.606
you can tell me stories about Maddie

07:30.641 --> 07:31.906
and make an old girl happy.

07:31.942 --> 07:33.575
- Well...
- Okay, yeah.

07:33.611 --> 07:34.954
- That'd be lovely.
- That'd be awesome.

07:34.978 --> 07:37.078
12:30 sharp.
You know the address, right?

07:37.114 --> 07:39.681
And-and you two don't have any
of those silly food allergies,

07:39.717 --> 07:41.261
or anything, do you?
Because I cook what I cook.

07:41.285 --> 07:42.783
And that's all that I cook.

07:42.818 --> 07:43.984
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:44.019 --> 07:45.586
- Great.
- All right. Thanks, ladies.

07:45.622 --> 07:47.087
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

07:47.123 --> 07:48.256
Nice meeting you, Barbara.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.257
Barbara, put your tongue back in.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.825
My gosh.

07:55.990 --> 07:58.056
Okay, Jenny, Channing,

07:58.092 --> 07:59.692
how'd you guys meet?

07:59.727 --> 08:01.759
We met at our friend
Ezra's birthday party.

08:01.795 --> 08:03.561
- Birthday party.
- We got the same gift

08:03.597 --> 08:04.941
- for each other.
- Whoa, like fate.

08:04.965 --> 08:06.464
Like, what was the gift?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.944
- Art book. Rothko.
- Scotch. Single malt.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.601
- Scotch.
- Roscoe's.

08:09.636 --> 08:10.935
- Wait, what?
- What's Roscoe's?

08:10.971 --> 08:11.936
Okay, very cute, but don't forget,

08:11.972 --> 08:13.638
- God lives in the details.
- Yeah?

08:13.673 --> 08:14.717
I thought he lived in the Middle East.

08:14.741 --> 08:16.107
Ooh, that's funny. You're funny.

08:16.142 --> 08:18.141
Okay, Jenny,
what do you do for a living?

08:18.176 --> 08:20.777
I manage an art gallery in Tucson.

08:20.813 --> 08:22.256
I pick the artists and curate the shows.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.614
Channing, w-what do you do?

08:23.649 --> 08:24.615
I'm a two-term state senator.

08:24.650 --> 08:25.516
- Whoa!
- What?

08:25.517 --> 08:26.638
That's not what we agreed on at all.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.550
- That's...
- Why not?

08:27.551 --> 08:28.813
- Alice and I used to...
- Because no one would believe

08:28.814 --> 08:30.453
- you're a fucking senator.
- What?

08:30.454 --> 08:32.197
We need to stick as close
to the truth as possible.

08:32.198 --> 08:33.782
Fewer complications, fewer mistakes.

08:33.783 --> 08:35.357
- It's very simple.
- Whatever. We gotta go.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.126
Okay. Back door. 1:15, sharp.

08:37.160 --> 08:40.162
Don't forget. Jenny, Channing,

08:40.197 --> 08:41.263
you're a lovely couple.

08:41.298 --> 08:42.798
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.167
Thanks, dearest.

08:45.202 --> 08:46.514
What are you doing?
Why are you touching me?

08:46.538 --> 08:48.804
Opening the door for you, darling.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.506
You're opening the door for me?

08:50.542 --> 08:52.702
- Come on, guys, don't be late.
- Do you see this fool?

08:54.210 --> 08:56.978
<i>And you always worry about her, Max.</i>

08:57.014 --> 08:58.190
You're with her all day at the bank.

08:58.214 --> 08:59.948
Is she doing her job, yes or no?

08:59.983 --> 09:02.083
I suppose she is.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.685
But is her head in the game?

09:03.720 --> 09:04.998
She said she's not messing around

09:05.022 --> 09:06.198
with this guy at the cafe but,

09:06.222 --> 09:07.956
Heller should have been closed by now.

09:07.991 --> 09:09.623
It's the easiest mark we've ever had.

09:09.659 --> 09:12.626
Maybe he's more
complicated than he seems.

09:12.662 --> 09:13.928
What do you mean?

09:13.963 --> 09:15.963
What do we really know
about Gary Heller?

09:15.998 --> 09:17.865
Just what we have in the Doctor's file.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.100
I got into his computer, but so far

09:20.135 --> 09:21.869
nothing much has turned up.
What about you?

09:21.904 --> 09:23.837
Did you find anything at the house?

09:23.873 --> 09:25.005
No. Nothing.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.041
Then what's the problem?

09:26.074 --> 09:27.040
I don't know.

09:27.075 --> 09:28.675
Just a feeling, I guess.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.954
Keep wondering why
the Doctor picked him.

09:29.978 --> 09:31.177
You had a feeling.

09:31.212 --> 09:32.723
You know,
if everybody just did their jobs

09:32.747 --> 09:34.224
and stopped worrying about
their goddamn feelings...

09:34.248 --> 09:37.050
Feelings aren't always bad,
Max, you know.

09:37.085 --> 09:38.718
Sometimes they get hurt, but...

09:38.753 --> 09:41.353
I'm talking about mixing
feelings and work.

09:41.389 --> 09:42.726
I know.

09:45.092 --> 09:46.803
- Look, I'm just saying...
- I'm serious. Stop it.

09:46.827 --> 09:47.993
All right. All right.

09:48.028 --> 09:50.295
We just have to land this guy. And soon.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.830
We will, Maxie.

09:51.865 --> 09:54.066
We always do.

10:01.911 --> 10:04.673
That was the loveliest afternoon

10:04.674 --> 10:07.745
I've had in a really, really long time.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.179
Good.

10:09.215 --> 10:10.648
Except for the barbecue.

10:10.683 --> 10:12.083
That was quite lovely as well.

10:12.118 --> 10:14.852
So then I'm sensing a pattern here.

10:14.887 --> 10:18.254
Me plus you equals lovely?

10:18.289 --> 10:19.289
Dig it.

10:20.191 --> 10:22.025
Okay, okay.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.927
You're right. I like...

10:23.962 --> 10:25.028
getting to know you.

10:25.063 --> 10:26.029
You know what? You're right.

10:26.064 --> 10:28.331
You are getting to know me.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.078
But I'm not getting to
know you much at all.

10:30.102 --> 10:31.278
Except for the fact that I know

10:31.302 --> 10:32.346
you don't like to talk about yourself.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.869
Ask me anything, baby.

10:33.904 --> 10:35.281
- I'm an open book.
- Favorite color?

10:35.305 --> 10:37.740
That's it? That's your big question?

10:37.775 --> 10:39.074
- That's it.
- Saffron.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.110
Should have known that.

10:40.144 --> 10:42.077
- Birthday?
- October 25th.

10:42.113 --> 10:43.779
Scorpio.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.347
And right around the corner.

10:45.382 --> 10:46.882
- Yeah.
- Last one.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.617
Are you attracted to me?

10:48.653 --> 10:50.852
What? What?

10:50.887 --> 10:52.754
Wait, this is funny?

10:52.789 --> 10:54.188
Yeah.

10:54.223 --> 10:56.390
Yeah, it's funny.

10:56.425 --> 10:58.793
I almost jumped you at the coffee shop

10:58.828 --> 11:00.061
the first time we met.

11:00.096 --> 11:02.196
Well, that's a relief.

11:02.231 --> 11:06.451
But I'm not sure that I'm gonna
be able to just be your friend.

11:13.475 --> 11:15.142
Tell me something...

11:15.177 --> 11:20.080
if I wait, just a little bit longer,

11:20.115 --> 11:23.050
could you maybe see it happening?

11:31.159 --> 11:32.257
Jesus Christ, man.

11:32.293 --> 11:33.336
What the hell are you doing?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.394
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.163
What's... what's happening here?

11:37.198 --> 11:39.231
What? Nothing much.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.133
This is Patrick, my friend.

11:41.169 --> 11:46.805
Patrick, this is my boss
and friend Gary Heller.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.773
Yeah. We were just
coming back from lunch.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.176
Lunch? Good. Nice. That's good.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.311
I... um, I stopped by
'cause I got you this

11:53.346 --> 11:54.946
after our night together
the other night.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.082
I thought you might enjoy it.
It's darts.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.183
Handcrafted, not cheap
like the ones at the pub.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.451
Thank you so much. That's so thoughtful.

12:01.486 --> 12:02.753
That's me, Mr. Thoughtful.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.167
We've been playing
darts together at night.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.690
I... I teach her how to play darts.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.358
- Do you play?
- Once or twice.

12:08.393 --> 12:09.359
- I'm not good at it.
- Yeah.

12:09.394 --> 12:11.161
Probably not a lot of time?

12:11.197 --> 12:13.163
'Cause you're in the gym,
you know, pumping iron,

12:13.199 --> 12:14.364
getting swole and all that.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.799
Swole, yeah. Something like that.

12:16.835 --> 12:17.835
Something like what?

12:17.869 --> 12:19.335
Hey, Gary,

12:19.370 --> 12:20.502
come on, we were just...

12:20.538 --> 12:22.438
You know what? I gotta take off.

12:22.473 --> 12:24.040
Good meeting you, Gary.

12:24.554 --> 12:25.924
Bye Saffron.

12:26.911 --> 12:28.144
What the hell was that?

12:28.179 --> 12:29.979
- What are you talking about?
- What?

12:30.014 --> 12:32.390
You were just so incredibly rude to him.

12:32.391 --> 12:34.449
Rude? You want to talk rude?

12:34.484 --> 12:36.395
I... I drive up and there's
some strange guy here,

12:36.419 --> 12:37.452
touching your face.

12:37.487 --> 12:38.854
Yeah, he's my friend, Gary.

12:38.889 --> 12:39.952
He's my friend.

12:39.953 --> 12:41.055
You've been here for, what, a month?

12:41.056 --> 12:42.559
You're making a lot of guy friends,
aren't ya?

12:42.560 --> 12:44.303
Just because we had one awkward dinner

12:44.304 --> 12:46.494
and you grabbed my tit
doesn't give you the right

12:46.529 --> 12:49.897
to be an asshole and embarrass
me in front of my friends.

12:49.932 --> 12:52.366
I mean, you can't just jam
a dart in someone's face

12:52.401 --> 12:54.135
every time you don't like something,

12:54.170 --> 12:55.535
like some kind of Neanderthal.

12:55.571 --> 12:56.571
I mean...

13:01.010 --> 13:02.076
I'm sorry.

13:02.111 --> 13:03.744
No, I-I'm sorry.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.146
Wait.

13:05.181 --> 13:07.046
Gary, hang on a sec.

13:09.858 --> 13:11.148
Gary, wait.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.292
Gary!

13:23.704 --> 13:25.638
God...

13:25.673 --> 13:26.972
God damn it.

13:43.414 --> 13:45.381
Yes, hi.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.116
My gosh.

13:47.142 --> 13:48.335
We made it.

13:50.678 --> 13:51.610
Hello.

13:51.646 --> 13:52.678
Hi.

13:52.713 --> 13:53.813
Hello.

13:53.848 --> 13:54.913
- Hey.
- These are for you.

13:54.949 --> 13:57.149
Goodness. Thank you.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.117
Come in. Come in.

13:59.153 --> 14:02.087
Arlen! Arlen!

14:02.122 --> 14:04.156
He must be napping.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.859
Um, he spends more time
asleep than awake these days.

14:07.894 --> 14:11.028
Help me put the food
on the table, Jenny.

14:11.064 --> 14:13.197
You know, you're a lot
prettier than you used to be.

14:13.232 --> 14:15.699
Plain is a word to describe
how you looked in your youth,

14:15.734 --> 14:17.969
which is probably why
I didn't recognize you.

14:18.004 --> 14:19.903
Probably.

14:22.797 --> 14:25.642
You know, I have never liked
feta cheese, Mrs. J.

14:25.678 --> 14:26.810
This is delicious.

14:26.846 --> 14:28.345
You eat like an athlete.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.313
I didn't mean that as a compliment.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.048
And you eat like all girls these days.

14:32.084 --> 14:33.683
Which means you don't eat.

14:33.718 --> 14:35.432
That's why you don't
have a bust or a rear.

14:35.467 --> 14:36.467
I...

14:36.754 --> 14:39.055
am a good eater,
I just have dietary issues...

14:40.092 --> 14:42.025
This is, um, last spring.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.961
It's from a gypsy village
outside of Belgrade.

14:44.996 --> 14:46.061
It was her last posting.

14:46.097 --> 14:47.729
She's been at UNICEF

14:47.764 --> 14:49.698
for six years now, working there.

14:49.733 --> 14:53.068
She's been all over,
and she always sends a postcard

14:53.104 --> 14:57.072
or a knickknack, which is nice, I guess.

14:57.108 --> 15:00.042
- This one...
- It's all photoshopped.

15:00.077 --> 15:01.043
This is from her time in Ghana.

15:01.078 --> 15:02.078
Look.

15:02.212 --> 15:03.744
- A thumb piano.
- Wow.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.346
And when she's not posted somewhere?

15:05.382 --> 15:06.981
Houston, of all places.

15:07.017 --> 15:09.917
I mean, I've never been there,
but still,

15:09.952 --> 15:14.155
I keep hoping that she'll...
find somebody,

15:14.190 --> 15:16.257
settle down, make a home.

15:16.292 --> 15:17.858
I bet you miss her.

15:17.894 --> 15:20.260
Well, she visits at Christmas
and we email.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.863
And email, I mean,
it's not like writing a real letter.

15:23.899 --> 15:26.699
But it's better than nothing, I guess.

15:29.771 --> 15:30.870
I mean, I...

15:30.906 --> 15:33.873
I always found her so mysterious.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.942
I think she was one of those people

15:35.977 --> 15:39.278
who lived in her head
with her daydreams.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.614
She didn't have many friends.
Didn't go to dances.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.017
I was always encouraging
her and she'd nod

15:45.053 --> 15:48.387
then not much would ever happen.

15:48.423 --> 15:51.023
Then she went off into the world and...

15:51.059 --> 15:54.759
Well, sometimes it's like
she was never even here.

15:54.794 --> 15:56.127
It's like when people leave you,

15:56.163 --> 15:58.763
sometimes the memories
just aren't enough.

15:58.798 --> 16:00.243
You wish you could make more of them.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.267
That's right.

16:02.302 --> 16:04.936
That's absolutely right.

16:04.971 --> 16:07.111
I always thought she was
a really great friend.

16:09.342 --> 16:11.241
Where is your restroom?

16:11.277 --> 16:12.477
- Just down the hall.
- Thanks.

16:33.831 --> 16:37.266
Yeah, I think you'd be a
perfectly suitable senator.

16:37.302 --> 16:39.302
You're handsome. Good at the BS.

16:47.511 --> 16:49.177
How's Senator Channing doing?

16:49.213 --> 16:50.278
Surprisingly well.

16:50.314 --> 16:51.846
Listen, she emails with Maddie,

16:51.881 --> 16:53.359
so you have to find her
computer or cell phone.

16:53.383 --> 16:54.760
- But how am I supposed to...
- Just do it!

16:54.784 --> 16:56.251
Okay. Fine.

17:14.237 --> 17:15.935
Arlen?

17:15.971 --> 17:17.231
Are you coming down?

17:19.241 --> 17:21.340
This is what happens when
you live with a ghost.

17:21.376 --> 17:23.108
You start hearing things.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.262
Hey.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.898
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

18:20.932 --> 18:22.265
I'm sorry, sir. I'm... I'm...

18:22.301 --> 18:24.100
I'm a friend of Maddie's.

18:24.135 --> 18:25.168
I know who you are.

18:25.204 --> 18:28.337
You can't be in her room
before the prom, dummy.

18:28.372 --> 18:29.505
Come on in. Come on.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.107
We gotta talk.

18:32.142 --> 18:33.875
Hey, come on.

18:33.911 --> 18:34.930
Right here.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.914
Yeah.

18:38.949 --> 18:41.883
So are your intentions honorable?

18:41.919 --> 18:42.984
Um, I...

18:43.020 --> 18:44.330
I was just pulling your leg, buddy.

18:44.354 --> 18:47.222
Of course they're not honorable.

18:47.257 --> 18:48.823
You think I've always been old?

18:48.858 --> 18:50.157
No, I-I don't.

18:50.193 --> 18:52.028
1964...

18:52.995 --> 18:55.496
Susie Carson. Buick Electra.

18:55.532 --> 18:57.098
Man.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.234
I had to tilt that sucker back.

18:59.269 --> 19:00.500
I'm sorry?

19:00.536 --> 19:03.303
You know, the... the handle.

19:03.339 --> 19:06.005
The... the chair. The...

19:06.041 --> 19:07.474
In the car, the seat.

19:07.509 --> 19:09.443
- The driver's seat.
- That's it. Yes.

19:09.478 --> 19:10.510
Yes.

19:10.546 --> 19:13.146
Had to tilt that sucker back.

19:15.551 --> 19:17.016
So what are you doing here?

19:17.052 --> 19:19.151
I...

19:19.186 --> 19:20.919
I'm taking Maddie to the prom.

19:20.955 --> 19:23.322
I knew that.

19:23.358 --> 19:25.157
Are your intentions honorable?

19:25.192 --> 19:26.292
Do you like to read?

19:26.327 --> 19:27.993
- I do, yeah.
- Yeah?

19:28.028 --> 19:29.595
Well, books are just, you know,

19:29.631 --> 19:32.632
they'll make you sad,
they fill your head and all that.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.611
I don't know. I always found,
personally, that, um...

19:34.635 --> 19:37.168
You know, don't keep staring
at the damn phone!

19:37.203 --> 19:39.437
Nobody's ca... Is anybody calling?

19:39.473 --> 19:40.538
No. Listen to me.

19:40.574 --> 19:42.006
I'm... I'm listening.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.108
Who wrote that book that is there

19:44.144 --> 19:47.512
in your... in your... Shit.

19:48.582 --> 19:50.548
In your... In your stomach there?

19:50.584 --> 19:52.549
Henry Miller.
It's the "Tropic of Cancer."

19:52.585 --> 19:54.685
All right. Okay, read it.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.487
- Out loud?
- Yes.

19:56.522 --> 19:57.988
Aloud.

19:58.023 --> 20:00.056
A loud. Loud.

20:00.092 --> 20:01.458
Okay.

20:05.598 --> 20:08.231
"When I realize that she is gone,

20:08.267 --> 20:10.300
"perhaps gone forever,

20:10.335 --> 20:12.134
"a great void opens up

20:12.170 --> 20:14.637
and I feel that I am falling."

20:18.543 --> 20:21.377
That is dead on, son.

20:21.413 --> 20:25.547
When Maddie goes off, when she...

20:25.582 --> 20:28.049
when she goes out into the world,

20:28.084 --> 20:31.085
a great void...

20:31.121 --> 20:33.689
will open up for me,

20:33.724 --> 20:35.990
and for her mother.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.046
Um, excuse me.

21:00.081 --> 21:01.113
Sir?

21:01.149 --> 21:03.550
What? What?

21:03.585 --> 21:06.285
Maddie wants to know the
password to your phone.

21:06.321 --> 21:08.187
- Maddie's home?
- Yeah.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.957
Yeah, she's in her room
getting ready for prom.

21:10.992 --> 21:13.125
Of course. Of course.

21:13.161 --> 21:15.228
Um, the password?

21:15.263 --> 21:17.596
I have dementia, son.

21:17.631 --> 21:19.631
There's no friggin' password.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.234
No password.

21:22.269 --> 21:24.102
Good deal.

21:24.137 --> 21:25.203
Thanks.

21:27.241 --> 21:31.243
Just as I'm about to reach in
and grab the last glazed donut,

21:31.278 --> 21:33.778
Joanna just knocks me out
of the way and takes it!

21:35.100 --> 21:37.314
- You're kidding!
- I know.

21:37.350 --> 21:39.250
And so at first, I think,
"I should let her"...

21:39.285 --> 21:41.719
I mean, she could die by,
like, lunchtime.

21:41.755 --> 21:42.755
Right.

21:43.690 --> 21:46.424
- Shit.
- Ms. Keyes!

21:46.459 --> 21:47.759
- Yeah?
- Take a look at this.

21:47.794 --> 21:49.660
- What... what is it?
- You cannot look at it

21:49.696 --> 21:52.429
if you do not open it.

21:52.464 --> 21:54.063
This. What is this?

21:54.099 --> 21:55.665
- A signature.
- Wrong.

21:55.701 --> 21:57.645
Mr. Wang, do you know the
difference between a signature

21:57.669 --> 21:58.780
- and an e-signature?
- Yes, sir.

21:58.804 --> 22:00.504
Wonderful! A competent person.

22:00.539 --> 22:02.517
Did I not ask you to get
Janice McDermott's signature?

22:02.541 --> 22:03.651
- Yes...
- And did you get it?

22:03.675 --> 22:05.241
- Is that her signature?
- No.

22:05.277 --> 22:07.110
No. So how can we expect

22:07.145 --> 22:09.512
the recipient of this document to trust

22:09.547 --> 22:13.248
that this was actually
signed by Janice McDermott?

22:13.284 --> 22:16.619
Trust is the basis of everything

22:16.654 --> 22:19.488
that happens at this institution.

22:27.214 --> 22:28.400
That was so great.

22:29.815 --> 22:30.780
Well, thank you, Margaret.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.014
It was lovely meeting you.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.849
Well, thank you for coming.

22:33.944 --> 22:35.944
It was a nice distraction.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.846
Mrs. J.

22:41.484 --> 22:43.451
<i>She has no idea who her daughter is.</i>

22:43.486 --> 22:45.987
After two-plus hours in there,
neither do we.

22:46.023 --> 22:47.789
I met her dad, Arlen.

22:47.825 --> 22:48.957
What was he like?

22:48.992 --> 22:50.324
In and out of reality,

22:50.359 --> 22:51.837
haunted by the memory of his daughter,

22:51.861 --> 22:53.794
so you know, pretty much just like us.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.399
But I did get this.

22:55.998 --> 22:57.475
Now we can track her
through her IP address.

22:57.499 --> 22:58.933
Okay, hang on, Mr. Robot.

22:58.968 --> 23:00.567
We're not taking Mrs. J's cell phone.

23:00.603 --> 23:02.803
These aren't rich people or assholes.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.571
We are one email away

23:04.607 --> 23:05.650
from figuring out where Maddie is.

23:05.674 --> 23:06.973
Come on, Richie, I'm starving.

23:07.008 --> 23:08.019
We can give it back later.

23:08.043 --> 23:09.008
Don't call me that.

23:09.044 --> 23:10.476
Mrs. J was really sweet

23:10.511 --> 23:12.311
and she taught me about feta cheese,

23:12.347 --> 23:14.447
so promise me that's
what we're gonna do.

23:14.482 --> 23:15.615
Say it, both of you.

23:15.650 --> 23:16.876
- Okay, we promise.
- Promise.

23:16.877 --> 23:18.952
With feta on top.
We'll take the phone back.

23:18.987 --> 23:20.453
- Now can we go?
- I'm driving.

23:20.488 --> 23:21.721
Shotgun.

23:28.462 --> 23:29.628
Have a good meeting.

23:29.663 --> 23:30.896
I'm sorry again a...

23:34.835 --> 23:35.835
Shit.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.634
- Viv?
- In the kitchen!

24:49.038 --> 24:51.671
Just finished.

24:51.707 --> 24:52.906
All done today.

24:52.942 --> 24:54.528
I see next time.

24:54.529 --> 24:58.078
I need you to stay for a minute,
actually.

24:58.113 --> 24:59.512
I stay?

24:59.548 --> 25:00.914
I've had a really shitty day.

25:01.976 --> 25:04.017
I'd just like to sit and talk with you.

25:04.053 --> 25:06.237
You know, the way we do.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.510
Yeah?

25:08.444 --> 25:10.387
I... I am very sorry.

25:10.388 --> 25:11.931
Maybe tomorrow I can?

25:11.932 --> 25:13.759
No.

25:13.794 --> 25:15.627
Now would be better.

25:15.663 --> 25:16.762
We'll have a drink.

25:16.797 --> 25:19.098
Do you like gin?

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
Maddie?

25:55.034 --> 25:56.800
I'm in the kitchen.

26:01.432 --> 26:03.432
Don't run, doll.

26:03.468 --> 26:05.568
You know the Doctor
doesn't like to chase.

26:05.603 --> 26:07.737
Nor do I.

26:23.287 --> 26:24.920
Hello, Maddie.

26:24.955 --> 26:26.454
I'm Lenny Cohen.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.390
Hey.

26:28.425 --> 26:30.592
Do you know who I am?

26:30.627 --> 26:32.593
Of course.

26:32.628 --> 26:35.196
Good. Let's eat.

26:38.927 --> 26:40.387
Why am I here?

26:41.841 --> 26:43.707
How did you get in?

26:43.743 --> 26:46.644
Don't answer a question
with a question. That's rude.

26:46.679 --> 26:47.890
Well, I was just wondering if...

26:47.914 --> 26:49.712
Take a bite of your omelet.

26:49.748 --> 26:52.082
You're just a tiny,
little thing, aren't you?

26:52.117 --> 26:53.983
Go on, honey.

26:54.019 --> 26:55.019
Eat.

26:58.424 --> 27:00.990
You asked me how I got in.

27:01.026 --> 27:03.393
Yes.

27:04.963 --> 27:06.862
You know perfectly well that

27:06.897 --> 27:09.265
how I got in here is irrelevant

27:09.300 --> 27:11.767
because here I am.

27:11.802 --> 27:14.937
Why I'm here, now,
that's your real concern.

27:14.972 --> 27:16.838
Okay, why are you here?

27:16.874 --> 27:18.074
You're being rude again.

27:18.109 --> 27:19.775
I asked you. You tell me.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.877
I'm really not sure.

27:21.912 --> 27:24.112
Heller is... coming along.

27:24.147 --> 27:27.415
You know, he's a bit more
challenging than we expected.

27:27.451 --> 27:30.185
Um, he's got a temper, let me tell you,

27:30.220 --> 27:31.786
but I have a calming effect on him,

27:31.821 --> 27:33.399
which is kind of the angle I was taking,

27:33.423 --> 27:36.057
you know, rather than just the
obvious seduction, you know.

27:36.093 --> 27:38.293
- He's the kind of guy that...
- I changed my mind.

27:38.328 --> 27:39.851
Stop talking.

27:41.830 --> 27:43.397
Why am I here?

27:44.054 --> 27:44.965
I don't...

27:45.000 --> 27:48.802
Does it have something
to do with Max or Sally?

27:48.837 --> 27:50.315
I mean, everyone
seems to be on edge, so...

27:50.339 --> 27:52.139
No, no.

27:52.174 --> 27:55.041
Maddie?

27:55.077 --> 27:59.312
Tell me about Patrick Campbell.

28:03.017 --> 28:05.318
He's a friend I made at the coffee shop

28:05.353 --> 28:06.819
across from the bank.

28:06.854 --> 28:07.886
Yes, I know.

28:07.922 --> 28:09.155
Tell me about him.

28:09.190 --> 28:10.289
Not much to tell.

28:10.325 --> 28:12.158
Nice guy. Nice family.

28:12.193 --> 28:13.159
Smart.

28:13.194 --> 28:14.926
You met his family?

28:14.961 --> 28:18.330
I... met some of them at a
barbecue he had at his house.

28:18.365 --> 28:21.166
It was really lovely and harmless.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.767
I'm glad you think so.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.436
The Doctor doesn't think so.

28:24.471 --> 28:27.772
Doesn't think it's harmless to
be spending time with someone

28:27.807 --> 28:29.341
who's not your mark.

28:29.376 --> 28:31.275
The Doctor doesn't think it's harmless

28:31.310 --> 28:34.111
that while you're on the job,

28:34.147 --> 28:37.848
while he's paying you to do one thing,

28:37.883 --> 28:40.851
you're actually doing another.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.454
Doesn't seem harmless
to the Doctor at all.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.788
Okay, I can understand how...

28:44.823 --> 28:46.157
Are you fucking him?

28:46.192 --> 28:47.158
No!

28:47.193 --> 28:48.324
Absolutely not.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.360
Not even a little.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.060
Not even a little?

28:53.131 --> 28:54.131
That's funny.

28:55.833 --> 28:57.500
I mean, I just meant that...

28:57.536 --> 28:58.846
You know what I mean. I just meant...

28:58.870 --> 29:01.204
Does he want to fuck you?

29:01.239 --> 29:04.707
You know, he... he did want to get,

29:04.742 --> 29:07.776
romantic, but I made it very clear

29:07.811 --> 29:09.444
that that was not going to happen.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.945
You want to fuck him?

29:11.356 --> 29:14.283
Why... why are we even having
this discussion?

29:14.318 --> 29:16.985
Handsome guy, smart, nice family...

29:17.020 --> 29:18.820
Seems rather fuckable to me.

29:18.855 --> 29:19.954
Well, I haven't

29:19.990 --> 29:22.390
and I'm not going to, so...

29:22.425 --> 29:24.725
I asked if you wanted to.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.959
More to the point,

29:25.995 --> 29:28.396
are you fucking Gary Heller?

29:28.431 --> 29:30.425
- Not yet, no.
- Not even a little?

29:32.268 --> 29:33.401
Does he want to fuck you?

29:33.436 --> 29:34.902
He seems interested, yes.

29:34.937 --> 29:35.937
Well...

29:36.439 --> 29:40.907
I heard he got upset with you today.

29:40.942 --> 29:43.376
That was a work related
misunderstanding.

29:43.412 --> 29:45.745
I... I can assure you, it...

29:45.780 --> 29:47.380
it's really not a big deal.

29:47.416 --> 29:49.816
Maddie, you're not doing your job.

29:49.851 --> 29:51.084
It is a big deal.

29:51.119 --> 29:52.219
That's not right.

29:52.254 --> 29:54.221
I... I think that I'm...

29:54.256 --> 29:55.988
Not even a question.

29:56.024 --> 29:58.924
The Doctor sends me when
people aren't doing their jobs,

29:58.959 --> 30:01.227
and...

30:01.262 --> 30:03.061
I'm here, aren't I?

30:03.097 --> 30:07.433
- Yes.
- So one more time.

30:07.468 --> 30:09.724
Why am I here?

30:11.539 --> 30:14.572
Because I'm not... doing my job.

30:14.608 --> 30:17.108
Yes. That's right.

30:17.143 --> 30:19.110
Because you're not doing your job.

30:19.145 --> 30:21.379
- So I'm here.
- Okay.

30:21.414 --> 30:23.948
And I'm going to stay here
until you do do your job.

30:23.983 --> 30:25.283
- Okay.
- Stop saying "okay."

30:25.318 --> 30:26.851
It's annoying.

30:26.886 --> 30:29.220
You know what's great

30:29.256 --> 30:30.920
about the Doctor?

30:30.956 --> 30:32.789
He really understands

30:32.824 --> 30:36.360
we all have our areas of expertise.

30:36.395 --> 30:38.094
He's so good...

30:38.130 --> 30:39.750
masterful, really...

30:40.132 --> 30:42.466
at employing us to do what we do best.

30:42.501 --> 30:44.301
And, Maddie,

30:44.336 --> 30:46.970
you are really good at your job.

30:47.005 --> 30:49.305
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

30:49.340 --> 30:52.441
I also am really good at my job.

30:52.477 --> 30:53.542
Yes.

30:53.578 --> 30:55.611
Sure you are.

30:55.647 --> 30:59.582
My job begins when you fail to do yours.

30:59.617 --> 31:00.583
Yes?

31:00.618 --> 31:01.620
Yes.

31:02.620 --> 31:05.453
So let me say a few things to help you.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.954
Everywhere you go,

31:06.990 --> 31:09.924
everything you do, everything you think

31:09.959 --> 31:12.494
should be about doing your job.

31:12.529 --> 31:14.596
So land Heller. Go to bed with him.

31:14.631 --> 31:17.465
Marry him. And disappear.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.001
You know the game.

31:20.036 --> 31:21.835
Just do your job.

31:21.870 --> 31:23.937
- Got it.
- And Patrick Campbell?

31:23.972 --> 31:26.072
Not helpful to this goal.

31:26.108 --> 31:28.074
So...

31:28.110 --> 31:29.176
lose him.

31:29.211 --> 31:31.312
- Understood.
- Start tonight.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.414
Yeah, I will.

31:33.449 --> 31:34.581
- Of course.
- Good.

31:36.151 --> 31:38.351
It's just, you don't want to see me

31:38.386 --> 31:39.985
do my job.

31:41.989 --> 31:43.679
Let's not let it come to that.

31:45.893 --> 31:48.628
Go on, sweetie,

31:48.663 --> 31:50.042
eat.

31:55.369 --> 31:57.302
<i>Ooh, smells good in here.</i>

31:57.338 --> 32:00.372
Hey, can we sit up
in that cabin-y section?

32:00.407 --> 32:02.307
- It's so...
- Cabin-y?

32:02.343 --> 32:04.042
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's not gonna be able

32:04.077 --> 32:05.522
- to tell what it is.
- Like Tinder or something?

32:05.546 --> 32:07.546
No. The app embeds a bug in the photo

32:07.581 --> 32:09.214
- that will attach to the email.
- Right.

32:09.249 --> 32:12.016
When Maddie opens it,
the browser automatically finds

32:12.052 --> 32:14.051
the IP address and the location

32:14.086 --> 32:15.397
of whatever device is on the email.

32:15.421 --> 32:16.387
So glamorous.

32:16.422 --> 32:17.655
You look like a...

32:17.690 --> 32:19.156
beautiful sea captain up here.

32:19.191 --> 32:21.392
Like a Viking princess or something.

32:21.427 --> 32:22.560
Well, thank you.

32:22.595 --> 32:24.495
Your waitress will be here in a moment.

32:24.530 --> 32:26.163
Hold up. You're not our waitress?

32:26.198 --> 32:27.710
No, I've gotta go back
to swabbing the deck

32:27.734 --> 32:28.699
over at the host stand.

32:28.735 --> 32:30.299
Argh. That sucks.

32:30.335 --> 32:31.646
All right, well,
don't be a stranger, okay?

32:31.670 --> 32:32.737
Come visit.

32:34.373 --> 32:36.339
Does that bullshit actually work?

32:36.375 --> 32:38.408
That's called being nice to people,
all right?

32:38.443 --> 32:40.543
You should try it sometime,
Grumpy McPoutsAlot.

32:40.579 --> 32:42.245
So once we have the IP address,

32:42.280 --> 32:44.091
- we can always find her?
- Or at least her phone.

32:44.115 --> 32:45.014
- Wow.
- Cool.

32:45.049 --> 32:46.582
Yet still no progress with jet packs.

32:46.617 --> 32:49.585
"Thinking of you. Hey, sweetie..."

32:49.620 --> 32:51.064
How do you know
Mrs. J calls her "sweetie"?

32:51.088 --> 32:52.187
It's in the other email.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.055
"Drove past your old school today.

32:54.091 --> 32:56.191
"Thought of you. Hope all is well

32:56.226 --> 32:58.660
so far away. Miss you. Mom."

32:58.696 --> 33:00.596
Now we just have to
wait for her to open it.

33:00.631 --> 33:02.598
- All right.
- Jesus, I'm starving.

33:02.633 --> 33:04.599
God, that lunch
was a crime against humanity.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.166
No wonder Maddie never comes home.

33:06.202 --> 33:08.235
Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Can we order? Thanks.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.279
So I had a shitty,

33:18.314 --> 33:22.048
shitty day.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.417
How about you? How was your day?

33:23.452 --> 33:24.618
Fine.

33:24.653 --> 33:26.520
You know, I clean the other house

33:26.555 --> 33:28.622
and then I clean yours.

33:28.657 --> 33:30.590
Two houses better than three.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.025
Drink.

33:32.060 --> 33:33.393
Yes.

33:37.132 --> 33:39.097
No, no. You've got to kill it.

33:39.133 --> 33:41.233
- Kill?
- Kill it. Like a shot.

33:41.268 --> 33:42.308
One.

33:44.405 --> 33:46.305
There you go. That's better.

33:47.675 --> 33:50.576
So where is this other house?

33:50.611 --> 33:53.145
This house you clean?

33:53.180 --> 33:56.080
The Markinson house. Forest Avenue.

33:56.115 --> 33:57.415
I don't know the Markinsons.

33:57.451 --> 33:59.083
But you know, I think I'd like to.

33:59.118 --> 34:00.496
Maybe I'll give them a call.
Is that okay?

34:00.520 --> 34:02.787
Of course. In my Apples phone in purse.

34:02.823 --> 34:05.490
- I get it.
- No. No, no, no. Sit.

34:05.525 --> 34:06.991
Later.

34:07.026 --> 34:08.259
We're having a drink.

34:13.197 --> 34:14.565
Cheers.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.732
Nastrovia. Whatever.

34:24.844 --> 34:26.777
It's got to be strange

34:26.812 --> 34:29.344
cleaning people's houses.
It's so intimate.

34:29.380 --> 34:31.280
Not sure I'd like it. I don't know.

34:31.315 --> 34:33.483
It's not so bad. It pays good...

34:33.518 --> 34:38.020
You know, when my mother
would leave the house...

34:38.054 --> 34:39.800
you know, I would never go
through her stuff.

34:39.824 --> 34:41.690
All the other neighborhood kids, they...

34:41.726 --> 34:43.759
They'd go through their parents' stuff.

34:43.795 --> 34:45.327
And now, you know what's funny?

34:45.362 --> 34:48.530
Every day, I deal with people's money.

34:48.565 --> 34:50.031
You know, it's just numbers,

34:50.065 --> 34:53.301
but it's like sneaking
through their lives.

34:53.335 --> 34:55.268
I can't imagine that.

34:55.304 --> 34:57.539
Well, you go through strangers' houses.

34:57.574 --> 34:59.770
I go through their bank accounts.

35:01.645 --> 35:04.211
Who else gets to

35:04.246 --> 35:06.847
peer into the dark corners
of our lives?

35:06.883 --> 35:08.448
I don't know.

35:08.484 --> 35:09.661
What do you mean you don't know?

35:09.685 --> 35:11.051
It's not complicated.

35:11.086 --> 35:14.321
Who else sneaks around

35:14.356 --> 35:16.356
and looks at other people's stuff?

35:16.392 --> 35:20.827
The dentist looks in our mouths.

35:20.862 --> 35:22.562
Dentist, yeah. That's good.

35:22.597 --> 35:24.463
That's intimate.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.132
But you know who else

35:26.167 --> 35:29.402
is far more intimate?

35:29.437 --> 35:31.738
The doctor.

35:31.773 --> 35:34.407
Do you go to the doctor?

35:34.442 --> 35:36.842
Of course, he's important.

35:36.877 --> 35:39.077
Have you been to the doctor recently?

35:39.112 --> 35:41.479
No, not in a while.

35:41.515 --> 35:45.751
Do you work for the Doctor?

35:45.786 --> 35:50.722
No, I don't clean any doctor's house.

35:50.758 --> 35:53.824
Who are you?

35:57.630 --> 36:02.499
Mr. Heller, I think maybe
you are drunken now.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.735
I go and I...

36:04.771 --> 36:06.671
Stop!

36:06.706 --> 36:08.773
Do you work for the Doctor,

36:08.808 --> 36:10.774
you Polish bitch?

36:10.809 --> 36:12.275
No, sir.

36:12.310 --> 36:14.177
Bullshit.

36:14.212 --> 36:15.278
No.

36:20.418 --> 36:21.418
Here we go.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.860
_

36:39.061 --> 36:42.200
_

36:44.041 --> 36:46.141
Something interesting?

36:46.176 --> 36:47.509
Nope.

36:47.544 --> 36:49.177
Good.

36:52.649 --> 36:53.615
Okay, you ready?

36:53.650 --> 36:54.616
Ready?

36:54.651 --> 36:56.985
Yep. Do it.

36:58.155 --> 36:59.988
- I hardly felt a thing!
- Yeah?

37:00.023 --> 37:01.366
Getting good, Mr. Bloom.
Getting really good.

37:01.390 --> 37:02.956
Thank you very much.

37:02.992 --> 37:04.536
- What's up, guys.
- Hey, man. Watch this.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.299
Yeah, show me.

37:09.064 --> 37:10.297
- What?
- Did you just stick it

37:10.333 --> 37:12.433
- in the hostess?
- Crude!

37:12.468 --> 37:14.335
- So what if I did?
- I don't believe it.

37:14.370 --> 37:16.014
Come on.
You saw the way she was looking at me.

37:16.038 --> 37:17.182
- What was I supposed to do?
- What?

37:17.206 --> 37:18.871
Where, in the... in the bathroom?

37:18.906 --> 37:21.141
- How do you even know?
- You just know, man.

37:21.176 --> 37:23.276
You just know.
And no, not in the bathroom,

37:23.311 --> 37:25.612
sicko. They got this little closet

37:25.647 --> 37:27.330
- for their coats.
- Disgusting!

37:27.365 --> 37:28.538
Who asked you?

37:28.885 --> 37:31.490
You know, for a wannabe artist,
you certainly have a lot of hang-ups.

37:31.514 --> 37:32.561
"Wannabe," are you kidding?

37:32.585 --> 37:33.875
- Guys, come on.
- Yeah, what hang-ups?

37:33.899 --> 37:35.019
When's the last time
you actually got some?

37:35.043 --> 37:35.848
Like I'm gonna tell you.

37:36.056 --> 37:37.400
Well, you're awfully
interested in who I'm screwing

37:37.424 --> 37:38.658
and when, but you won't talk about it?

37:38.659 --> 37:40.137
- Can I show you the watch lift?
- Tell me. Tell me.

37:40.161 --> 37:41.893
Cece was what, two years ago?

37:41.928 --> 37:44.040
- Was she the last time?
- I've been laid in two years.

37:44.064 --> 37:46.064
- I have!
- Okay. Sure, if you say so.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.899
You guys need anything else?

37:47.934 --> 37:49.201
Some dessert?

37:49.236 --> 37:51.303
I think just the check. Thank you.

37:51.338 --> 37:53.337
By the way,
the service here was incredible.

37:53.373 --> 37:54.905
Thanks.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.874
My God,
he's like a boner with a body.

37:56.909 --> 37:58.209
Now, that's funny.

37:59.579 --> 38:01.312
My God, she opened it.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.946
- Is it working?
- What's happening?

38:06.386 --> 38:08.219
Holy shit.

38:08.254 --> 38:10.420
Seattle.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.921
She's in Seattle.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.923
- Seattle?
- You're a genius.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.425
My God!

38:15.460 --> 38:17.227
- Great job.
- So... no!

38:17.262 --> 38:18.928
- Away.
- All right.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.997
So let's get that phone
back to Mrs. J, pronto.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.050
You promised, right?

38:22.401 --> 38:23.533
What's the matter with you?

38:23.569 --> 38:25.101
We're gonna need more money.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.035
- To pay for dinner?
- To pay for Seattle.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.672
And everything we have to do there.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.485
Maddie?

38:44.521 --> 38:45.486
I'll make this right.

38:45.522 --> 38:47.288
- I promise.
- Good.

38:47.324 --> 38:50.325
Because you'll be seeing
me around until it's done.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.459
All right?

38:52.214 --> 38:53.628
All right.

39:31.332 --> 39:32.632
Hello?

39:37.906 --> 39:39.504
Mr. Heller?

39:57.756 --> 39:58.789
Mr. Heller?

41:02.617 --> 41:05.218
Get out of here.

41:13.395 --> 41:17.095
Get out of here.
