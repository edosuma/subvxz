And then he had many kids.

Oof.

Yeah, in the office.

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:39.125
Let's go.

01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:41.416
-Are you fucked up?
-You know it.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.125
(Felipe chuckles)

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:52.375
Damn, Saúl's going to make out
with that little gangster.

01:29:52.458 --> 01:29:55.208
I don't care that he bats
for the other team,

01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:57.708
but why does he have to
rub it in our face?

01:29:57.791 --> 01:30:03.333
I know, man. If he's in the bathroom,
I'm scared to pull my dick out.

01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:06.416
-Wouldn't want to catch something.
-Don't flatter yourself.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.458
See you, fellas.
I think I'll call it a night.

01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:10.625
-Already?
-Yeah, good night.

01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:12.750
Right from my hand, like a bird.

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.375
-There it is.
-That's good.

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:38.416
I really can't do this.

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:41.625
It's okay, don't worry.

01:30:42.708 --> 01:30:44.750
Don't freak out.

01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:46.541
It's okay.

01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:47.875
I'm sorry.

01:30:47.958 --> 01:30:49.375
(chuckles)

01:30:50.625 --> 01:30:52.208
See you around, stud.

01:30:54.833 --> 01:30:57.291
-(lively chatter)
-(music playing in Spanish)

01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:02.916
I want us to be friends.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.583
Can I be your friend?

01:31:07.791 --> 01:31:11.041
Listen, you can be famous!
You don't know your potential,

01:31:11.125 --> 01:31:13.375
but I have a nose for these things.

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:14.958
Trust me.

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:27.708
(lively big band music playing)

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:35.875
EXPERIENCES WITH THE SON OF SANTO

-(crowd cheering)
-(music ends)

01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:40.958
Welcome once again

01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:43.291
to Experiences with the Son of Santo.

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:49.041
I won this trophy a year ago
at Palacio de los Deportes

01:31:49.125 --> 01:31:54.208
against a great luchador
who was unknown back then.

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.791
Although I defeated him,

01:31:57.875 --> 01:32:00.833
that night, a star was born.

01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:06.291
Tonight, he will join us
to look back on this time

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:11.208
and so I can pay my respects
and show my admiration

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:15.041
to a pioneer of the gay community
in the world of lucha libre.

01:32:16.875 --> 01:32:21.250
He has changed the image
of exótico wrestlers.

01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:25.041
Joining us tonight in
Experiences with the Son of Santo,

01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:28.500
my dear old friend, Cassandro the Exótico.

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:31.000
-(crowd cheering)
-(lively music playing)

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:39.708
-Welcome, dear friend.
-Thank you so much.

01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:41.875
-Do you want to fight, or talk?
-No.

01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:44.625
It's better if we talk,
please have a seat.

01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:47.000
We will talk as friends.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:50.458
Cassandro, you know that our audience

01:32:50.541 --> 01:32:55.416
wants to learn new things
about our old friends.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.291
Tell us something.

01:32:58.666 --> 01:33:00.625
Well...

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:07.000
For me... my greatest source of
inspiration are women.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.625
I was raised by women.

01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:15.916
Women have helped me learn
who I want to be,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.625
where I want to go, and where I come from.

01:33:19.708 --> 01:33:23.125
I have great admiration for Mother Teresa,

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:27.166
Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Marie Curie

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:29.458
and for Princess Diana.

01:33:30.541 --> 01:33:33.541
Lady Anarquía, my friend and trainer.

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:35.500
She's always been there. And...

01:33:35.583 --> 01:33:37.500
My mother, of course.

01:33:37.583 --> 01:33:44.458
My mother was the one
who made me who I am.

01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:50.500
How have you overcome
adversity and strife?

01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:52.416
What's your secret?

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:59.000
I just try to be myself.
Just being me.

01:34:00.916 --> 01:34:02.125
I think that's how.

01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:04.708
What's next for Cassandro?

01:34:04.791 --> 01:34:09.750
I have the pleasure to announce
we're launching a world tour.

01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:11.166
We're bringing Mexican
wrestling everywhere

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:13.083
-because it's the best in the world.
-(crowd cheering)

01:34:13.166 --> 01:34:14.583
That's right.

01:34:14.666 --> 01:34:16.583
We're taking it everywhere.

01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:22.708
Cassandro, if you allow me,
I would like to pass the mic

01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:27.041
to a young man who has a message for you.

01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:28.500
-Of course.
-Shall we?

01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:31.833
-Yes, where is he?
-Right here, in front of us.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:36.708
Cassandro, it's a dream come true
to talk to you in person.

01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:42.166
I've seen all your fights
on the Saturday shows,

01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:45.166
and I've seen you live
five different times.

01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:49.458
I also collect your merch,
including your action figure.

01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:56.583
A few... A few months ago...

01:34:57.958 --> 01:35:00.541
I came out to my father.

01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:05.041
I told him, and he...

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:09.166
he gave me his support.
He's here with me tonight.

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:11.458
(crowd cheering)

01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:19.333
I couldn't have done it
if it wasn't for you.

01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:21.750
Bravo.

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.416
