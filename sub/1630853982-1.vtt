24:54.063 --> 24:56.569
the Laura Feinberg
say those words.

24:56.602 --> 24:58.038
- Oh, it is creepy
when you come out

24:58.071 --> 24:59.541
of the shadows
like that, Irwin.

24:59.575 --> 25:01.111
- I don't control
the lighting in here.

25:01.144 --> 25:02.547
You do.
LAURA: You know,

25:02.581 --> 25:04.718
maybe Mama wasn't running
from the Devil.

25:04.752 --> 25:08.125
Maybe Mama was running
from being a real mama.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.964
- Uh, okay.

25:10.997 --> 25:14.237
So if Mama's not running,
what's next on the docket?

25:14.270 --> 25:15.707
LAURA: I don't know.

25:15.740 --> 25:18.211
What do people do
in the suburbs anyway, huh?

25:18.245 --> 25:21.217
Rake leaves?
Start book clubs?

25:21.251 --> 25:23.121
Walk into the ocean
and drown themselves?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.125
I mean...

25:25.159 --> 25:27.564
- Hey.
You want to watch Con Air?

25:27.597 --> 25:29.702
- You read Mama's mind.
