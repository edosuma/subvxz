WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:04.134
PAIGE:
I have things
to do, too, you know?

00:04.308 --> 00:06.571
I have all these parents
on my back right now.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.617
Oh, and my
freshman potions class?

00:08.791 --> 00:09.748
Let's see, I ordered

00:09.922 --> 00:11.272
500 dried toads.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.621
What did I get?

00:12.795 --> 00:14.275
Mm. 500 wet ones.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.885
Look, Paige,
it's just really hard

00:16.059 --> 00:17.756
for me to get on board
with this, when Piper,

00:17.930 --> 00:20.020
the actual mother, is totally
against doing the wiccaning.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.413
That's what Grams is here for,
to convince her.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.328
Look at Wyatt.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.808
He didn't have one

00:25.982 --> 00:27.201
until he was
six months old,

00:27.375 --> 00:28.898
and he almost
turned evil.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.421
Now, look at that
little sweet face.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.727
You want a repeat of that?

00:31.901 --> 00:33.468
PHOEBE:
No, of course I don't.

00:33.642 --> 00:37.907
Hear me now, hear my cries,
spirit from the other side.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.257
Cross now
the great divide.

00:41.737 --> 00:46.046
GRAMS:
You mean she is still lying
about her age?

00:46.220 --> 00:47.743
[Grams laughing]

00:47.917 --> 00:51.399
Um, what, what...

00:51.573 --> 00:52.574
Not a good time, girls.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.793
I'm busy.You're dead.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.926
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't have a life.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.582
Oh, well, all right...

01:00.756 --> 01:01.844
Hi.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.455
Hello, darlings...

01:04.629 --> 01:06.675
[chuckles]
Aw, sweetie.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.982
Oh, so, what brings me
down here?

01:10.157 --> 01:11.593
A wiccaning
for your great-grandson.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.290
Providing Piper
doesn't kill us first.

01:13.464 --> 01:14.683
A wiccaning?

01:14.857 --> 01:17.120
Uh, I thought
we already did that.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.600
Not for baby Chris.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.471
[Chris gurgling]

01:21.603 --> 01:23.083
Um... help me out here.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.607
Last time I knew,
he was a six-foot whitelighter?

01:25.781 --> 01:27.130
Yeah, that was Chris
from the future.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.306
This is baby Chris now.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.874
Piper and Leo
had this night.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.397
Do you really need
us to explain this

01:33.571 --> 01:35.747
to you, or can you just
be happy to see him?

01:35.921 --> 01:37.445
Good gracious.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.665
Wyatt has a little baby brother.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.842
Oh, he is sweet.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.106
So, when does Piper
want to do this?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.847
Well, technically, never.

01:49.021 --> 01:52.068
Nonsense, you can't deny this
child his ancestral blessings.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.852
It's a witch's compass for good.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.593
I mean, who knows

01:55.767 --> 01:58.118
what terrible evils
could befall him otherwise.

01:58.292 --> 02:01.121
See, now, that's the kind of
stuff that Piper needs to hear.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.428
[Chris gurgling]

02:06.909 --> 02:09.564
Wyatt, don't pick on your
little brother like that.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.043
Now, give it back!

02:16.092 --> 02:17.963
What was that all about?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.488
He's fine, he probably just
orbed himself up to his room.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.229
PHOEBE:He's having
a hard time right now.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.882
His Dad's never around,

02:24.056 --> 02:25.754
his little brother's
getting all the attention,

02:25.928 --> 02:28.060
he's constantly being chased
by the underworld, you know.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.324
Well, I'm afraid he's just
going to have to get used to it.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.587
He's two.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.632
Right. Oh, here.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.286
Okay.

02:37.505 --> 02:40.551
I'll go up and apologize.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.510
Still think this was
a good idea?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.209
[gasps]

02:46.383 --> 02:47.776
GRAMS:
Girls!

02:48.603 --> 02:49.734

02:51.040 --> 02:53.390
[Chris crying]

02:54.174 --> 02:55.871
Shelf!

02:59.701 --> 03:01.050
[crying]

03:02.791 --> 03:06.098

03:20.765 --> 03:24.813

get here whenever you can.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.725
Okay, thanks.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.336
Bye.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.033
You okay, Piper?

04:11.207 --> 04:12.948
Yeah, why?

04:13.122 --> 04:15.733
Well, a beer shipment delay
so close to the weekend,

04:15.907 --> 04:18.040
I expected there'd be more...
fireworks.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.955
Oh no, it's no big deal.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.000
We'll just charge more
for the ginger ale.

04:23.045 --> 04:23.959
I'm kidding.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.613
See, there you go again.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.571
I don't know what,
but something's going on.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.486
No.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.923
You know how people just leave
things up to a higher power?

04:32.097 --> 04:36.101
Well, I'm trying to live
my life without any powers.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
Makes for a lot less stress.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.976
Piper!
Until now.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.068
What's that face for?

04:46.242 --> 04:47.635
Your sister can't come by

04:47.809 --> 04:49.289
without there being
something wrong?

04:49.463 --> 04:50.812
What's up?

04:50.986 --> 04:51.943
Nothing...

04:52.117 --> 04:53.684
nothing's up, you know.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.860
Why would you think
anything is up?

04:56.034 --> 04:58.515
I just came by
to tell my sister

04:58.689 --> 05:00.865
that I finally won
a reader's choice award.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.563
Congratulations.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.260
Thanks.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.611
Yeah, and maybe there's
one more thing, you know.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.571
Something happened today
after we summoned Grams.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.615
What?! What...

05:11.789 --> 05:13.704
Why did you summon Grams?

05:13.878 --> 05:15.358
For Chris' wiccaning,

05:15.532 --> 05:17.882
it was Paige's idea,
not mine, don't blame me.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.797
What did I say?
I don't want any magic.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.452
Look, I know my kids can't have
a completely normal life,

05:22.626 --> 05:24.324
but I've gotta give it a shot.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.630
Yes, absolutely and I think
we should start tomorrow.

05:26.804 --> 05:27.979
Because, uh...

05:28.153 --> 05:30.155
a demon attacked Wyatt.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.811
And you wait till now
to tell me?!

05:33.985 --> 05:36.248
I didn't want to worry you
and he's okay, Piper.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.816
Leo!

05:38.990 --> 05:41.515
Oh, hi, sweetie,
how are you?

05:41.689 --> 05:43.299
Don't you "sweetie" me,
where are the boys?

05:43.473 --> 05:45.170
Oh, but they are
perfectly fine,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.781
Paige took them
to Magic School.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.783
Leo, now!

05:48.957 --> 05:50.480
Leo!

05:50.654 --> 05:52.090
Honey, are you sure

05:52.264 --> 05:53.657
you want him down here?

05:53.831 --> 05:55.398
I mean, considering
that he can't even tell

05:55.572 --> 05:56.878
good from evil any more.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.707
Well, you know,
lost soul and all.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.450
Oh, uh...
Paige filled me in.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.277
Okay, first of all,

06:05.452 --> 06:08.237
our children's safety is Leo's
number one priority,

06:08.411 --> 06:10.848
no matter how lost
he may be.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.372
Leo!

06:12.546 --> 06:13.416
What's
the matter?

06:13.590 --> 06:14.722
What happened?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.288
A demon attacked Wyatt,
he's okay.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.594
He's at the school.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.204
What kind of demon was it?No idea.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.206
It had some sort of creepy mask.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.034
Oh, and it
struck me down

06:23.208 --> 06:24.253
with a lightning bolt.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.081
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.735
I can't do this again.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.040
Don't worry, I'm gonna
go back down there,

06:29.214 --> 06:30.128
I'm gonna find out who it was.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.043
Down there?

06:32.217 --> 06:33.349
As in the underworld?

06:33.523 --> 06:34.916
Hang out there a lot, do you?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.396
Best place to vanquish demons,
isn't it?

06:38.702 --> 06:39.616
Listen,

06:39.790 --> 06:41.183
Piper...

06:41.357 --> 06:43.011
far be it for me to meddle...Then don't.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.665
Because you're already
pressing your luck

06:44.839 --> 06:46.101
being here in the first place.

06:46.275 --> 06:49.452
Yeah, I know about
the wiccaning.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.370
I don't know why you're being
so stubborn about it.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.504
I mean, what better way
to ward off demon attacks?

06:57.678 --> 06:59.854
The demon went after
Wyatt, not his brother.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.943
Well, all the more reason
to protect Chris.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.380
Except for the fact
that Wyatt's wiccaning

07:04.554 --> 07:06.295
didn't really protect
him, now did it?

07:06.469 --> 07:09.385
Aside from the fact that
it almost destroyed you,

07:09.559 --> 07:11.692
or do you not remember your
friend the Necromancer?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.345
I just need
to find out who

07:13.520 --> 07:15.913
the hell is after my son.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.400
I saw that, Wyatt.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.923
You give that back
to your little brother

07:26.097 --> 07:28.273
while I find out who's
trying to kill you.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.362
Well, whoever it is
can't get to 'em here.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.234
These guys are protected.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.627
Yes, Wyatt is,
but his little brother

07:33.801 --> 07:35.063
is not so protected from him.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.499
It's gotta be tough for him.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.109
He's a new kid
on the block,

07:38.283 --> 07:40.764
suddenly he's yesterday's news,
now, I mean...

07:40.938 --> 07:42.505
Spoken like a true
older brother.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.908
Student progress reports.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
But the year hasn't
gone on long enough

07:55.953 --> 07:57.433
for there to be any progress.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.175
Afraid I can't help you
with that, Miss Matthews.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.612
But I did find something
on masked demons.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.571
Paige, please.
What have you got?

08:04.745 --> 08:05.789
A couple of
possibilities.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.226
Could be an Aztec demon.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.401
Chinese false-face demon.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.751
Any of those look familiar?

08:10.925 --> 08:12.927
No, Ben, I'm sorry, they don't.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.537
When I took this job,

08:14.711 --> 08:16.452
I had no idea just how
much work it would be.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.758
Who knows what
I'm letting slip

08:17.932 --> 08:19.411
through the cracks.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.761
I think I just found

08:20.935 --> 08:21.936
the first thing.
What?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.111
Your nephew.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.116
Wyatt, where did you orb
your little brother?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.031
[doorbell rings]

08:30.205 --> 08:33.991
No, Paige, he's not here,
where the hell is he?!

08:35.819 --> 08:38.779
Oh, I hope this is yours,
'cause it sure isn't mine.

08:38.953 --> 08:39.780
Thank God.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.346
I got him.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.349
Hi there you...

08:44.524 --> 08:46.917
And you...
Hi.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.180
I stepped up on the porch
and all of a sudden

08:49.354 --> 08:51.313
the little guy just
flies into my arms.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.229
Yeah, his brother orbed
him from Magic School.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.665
Oh, is that normal?

08:55.839 --> 08:57.275
Has been lately.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.889
Victor, what are you
doing here?

09:02.063 --> 09:04.544
And a big hello to you,
too, Betty.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.023
I was invited for a wiccaning.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.069
Oh, sorry.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.246
Wiccanings are only for
magical family members.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.335
That's not what Paige says.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.424
Well, Paige doesn't
know all the rules.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.818
Okay, I can see this
is gonna go really well,

09:17.992 --> 09:20.124
but it really doesn't
matter who was invited

09:20.298 --> 09:21.822
because there isn't going
to be a wiccaning.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.737
Paige seems to think
that if she crams

09:23.911 --> 09:25.390
enough family members
down my throat

09:25.565 --> 09:27.479
that I'm gonna give in,
but it's not gonna work.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.655
Because nothing

09:28.829 --> 09:30.221
is working.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.963
There is some creepy-ass demon
after my son

09:33.137 --> 09:34.835
and now Wyatt wants
to orb his brother

09:35.009 --> 09:38.186
all over creation
for God only knows what reason!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.101
Well, isn't that
just boys being boys?

09:40.275 --> 09:42.233
I mean, there's always gonna be
some sibling rivalry.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.192
No, actually, it's not.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.281
This is not them
fighting over toys.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.239
They nearly kill each
other in the future.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.893
You know,

09:50.067 --> 09:52.896
there's an easy to nip
this thing in the bud.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.681
And what would that be exactly?

09:57.509 --> 10:00.425
Snakes and Ladders...

10:00.600 --> 10:01.557
a very

10:01.731 --> 10:04.560
unfortunate
halter top...

10:04.734 --> 10:07.563
but I don't see your
little black book.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.825
I do.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.697
Oh. Thank you.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.786
Don't want me looking up
the old boyfriends, huh?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.788
They were in a much
bigger book, thank you.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.703
No, these contain

10:16.877 --> 10:18.705
spells I used to use on the
girls when they were younger.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.750
You used spells
on my daughters?

10:20.924 --> 10:22.230
Every now and then.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.712
Hey, you try raising
three girls by yourself...

10:25.886 --> 10:27.409
keeping them in line.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.672
How else was I gonna stop them
from misbehaving?

10:29.846 --> 10:31.239
Gee, I don't know...

10:31.413 --> 10:32.414
by talking to them?

10:32.588 --> 10:33.676
Talking?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.243
Hey, how's about

10:35.417 --> 10:37.027
we just find that damn
spell, how's that sound?

10:37.201 --> 10:38.681
That's your answer for
everything isn't it?

10:38.855 --> 10:40.509
I was essentially
a single parent.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.730
Patty was dead, and it's not
as if you were ever around.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.819
You wouldn't
allow me to be.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.822
Okay! Do I need to find
something to separate you two?

10:48.996 --> 10:50.519
You know
your daughters

10:50.693 --> 10:52.608
only ended up saving the world
every other week.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.742
Believe it or not, it might have
had something to do with the way

10:55.916 --> 10:57.265
I raised them.
Found it!

10:57.439 --> 10:59.615
"Spell to resolve
sibling rivalry."

10:59.789 --> 11:01.312
Oh, good, good.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.054
I'll get the boys
and you call your sisters.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.534
We'll get rid of the rivalry

11:05.708 --> 11:07.275
and then you can use
the Power of Three

11:07.449 --> 11:08.624
to vanquish the demon, okay?

11:08.798 --> 11:10.278
Great, more magic.

11:10.452 --> 11:13.107
Do you have any other
suggestions?

11:13.281 --> 11:14.543
PHOEBE:
I have a suggestion.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.809
The next time "Ask Phoebe" wins
an award,

11:19.983 --> 11:22.116
you should probably
try calling Phoebe.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.118
Let me get back to you, Diane.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.381
Sorry, research.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.948
So what's going on?

11:28.122 --> 11:29.993
Uh, did you just hear
what I said?

11:30.167 --> 11:32.953
Yeah, I wasn't trying
to snake the award from you.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.302
I was actually gonna
accept it

11:34.476 --> 11:35.956
on your behalf,
because I was under

11:36.130 --> 11:38.001
the now-very-mistaken impression

11:38.175 --> 11:39.568
that you were actually taking
some time off.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.569
[phone rings]

11:40.743 --> 11:42.049
Uh, just one second.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.267
Yeah, this is Leslie.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.616
Hey,

11:44.791 --> 11:45.748
Rachel!

11:45.922 --> 11:46.793
Hmm, research?

11:46.967 --> 11:49.709
Oh, no, this is personal.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.188
Yeah, can I
call you back?

11:51.362 --> 11:52.363
Great.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.975
Now where was I?

11:56.498 --> 11:58.761
You were making some lame excuse

11:58.935 --> 12:00.676
about how you're about
to accept an award

12:00.850 --> 12:01.938
for something you didn't write.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.724
Actually, I did write it.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.166
Oh.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.561
Congratulations.

12:17.693 --> 12:18.694
You know, Phoebe,

12:18.868 --> 12:20.261
when I write these columns,

12:20.435 --> 12:22.219
I'm really, really trying
to channel you

12:22.393 --> 12:23.525
and your...

12:23.699 --> 12:25.135
you know, your vibe.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.572
Spare me the false humility.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.226
Yeah, that was pretty false.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.272
Well, look, why don't we go

12:31.446 --> 12:32.403
to this thing together?

12:32.577 --> 12:33.970
It's today, it's not too late.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.450
You can go and accept
the award yourself.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.234
No, I think that you
should go accept it

12:37.408 --> 12:40.237
and maybe bring one
of your phone pals with you.

12:45.634 --> 12:46.896
Okay, let's make
this quick.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.289
I have four real
angry parents

12:48.463 --> 12:49.507
waiting for me
in the office.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.249
Well, there's
my other grandson.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.512
Um, come along,darling.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.905
I need you
to stand

12:56.079 --> 12:57.864
by your little
brother right there.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.344
You do know
what you're doing, right?

13:00.518 --> 13:01.650
Paige, dear,

13:01.824 --> 13:03.739
we're getting
our Wiccaning.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.567
I said maybe.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.351
We have a few more
pressing issues

13:07.525 --> 13:08.744
to deal with
at the moment.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.094
Hmm, what changed
your mind?

13:11.268 --> 13:12.400
Nothing, although

13:12.574 --> 13:13.923
it's getting harder
and harder

13:14.097 --> 13:15.620
to say no with
the arrival

13:15.795 --> 13:16.752
of a new
family member

13:16.926 --> 13:17.927
every five minutes.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.844
All right, are you two ready
to finally get along?

13:25.108 --> 13:27.415
"Pass your petty jealousies
to darkest night.

13:27.589 --> 13:32.159
Let these feuding siblings
no longer fight."

13:36.772 --> 13:38.600
Okay, shouldn't those stop now?

13:38.774 --> 13:40.341
Grams, are you sure
this is the right spell?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.082
Remind me never to go

13:42.256 --> 13:43.474
on sabbatical again...

13:47.174 --> 13:49.263
...'cause that Leslie
is such a jerk-face!

13:49.437 --> 13:50.525
Oh, please,
you solike him.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.526
I do not!

13:51.700 --> 13:52.919
PIPER:
Do, too!

13:53.093 --> 13:54.311
I do not, Piper.You so like him.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.270
I do not, Paige!
Do not, Piper!Do, too!

13:56.444 --> 13:58.620
Why don't you just
marry him already?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.187
Why don't you
just marry Leo?

14:00.361 --> 14:01.449
'Cause I already did.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.580
Leo! Leo!

14:02.754 --> 14:04.104
I want to get married.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.759
Girls, he's here.
Piper, blast him!

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
[all shrieking]

14:12.590 --> 14:13.417
Girls...

14:13.591 --> 14:14.636
[all shrieking]

14:20.903 --> 14:23.079
Any more great ideas?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.042
I am so outta here!

14:29.216 --> 14:31.435
Phoebe, do not go
out that front door!

14:31.609 --> 14:33.002
Try and stop me!
Phoebe!

14:35.091 --> 14:36.919
Geez, blow my head off
why don't you!

14:37.093 --> 14:38.834
Oh, come on,
it was an accident!

14:39.008 --> 14:41.663
Paige, no one leaves this house
until I reverse that spell.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.665
Phoebe, don't.I mean it, Paige.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.536
Sayonara.
Paige...

14:46.798 --> 14:48.583
Phoebe, Phoebe,
don't you dare leave this house!

14:48.757 --> 14:50.628
Why not? Paige did!

14:50.802 --> 14:52.761
That doesn't count.
She probably went
to Magic School.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.025
Yeah, well, I'm going
to the Reader's Choice Award.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.418
Phoebe, you've got more
important things to worry about

14:57.592 --> 14:58.593
than some silly award.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.641
Way to go, Grams.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.730
Piper, don't be rude!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.384
Look, it's not my fault.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.777
It's only the stupidest
book ever,

15:08.951 --> 15:10.344
and you said
the stupid spell

15:10.518 --> 15:12.215
would work and it didn't!
So you know what?

15:12.389 --> 15:13.695
I'm gonna make..."Let this girl,
quick as a sneeze,

15:13.869 --> 15:15.349
...no more magic
in this house

15:15.523 --> 15:18.308
stop this snit
and quickly freeze!"

15:18.482 --> 15:19.831
That's better.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.139
Why is my daughter a statue?

15:23.313 --> 15:26.708
She's fine.
She'll thaw out
in a minute.

15:26.882 --> 15:30.364
Yeah. How do I know she won't
be this way forever?

15:30.538 --> 15:34.890
That it won't backfire
like your last brilliant spell?

15:35.064 --> 15:37.197
Have you heard a peep
out of those boys?

15:37.371 --> 15:40.200
No, because the
spell worked.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.202
Pulled the rivalry
right out of them.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.466
Unfortunately, it went into
the nearest set of siblings.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.163
In this case, the girls.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.470
Anyway, they know

15:49.644 --> 15:51.776
everything that's going on
in their adult lives.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.561
The only difference
is they're not adults.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.564
Yeah, well, just tell me how
to get 'em back to normal.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.871
Easy, I just have to figure out
a reversal spell,

16:00.046 --> 16:01.699
hopefully,
before the demon returns.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.266
Oh, and we gotta
get the boys

16:03.440 --> 16:05.051
to Magic School--
they'll be safe there.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.530
Fine, tell me
how to get there.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.881
You don't.
Magic School is not for mortals.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.797
Well, they'll just have to make
an exception, won't they?

16:12.972 --> 16:16.888
Ah, forget it, Victor.
Call Leo. He'll take them.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.761
Leo!

16:29.075 --> 16:30.990
[eerie whooshing]

16:33.209 --> 16:35.733
Kind of an odd place
for an Elder to visit.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.909
Then again,

16:38.084 --> 16:39.607
the word is,

16:39.781 --> 16:41.565
you can't get enough
of the dark side these days.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.090
Someone from the underworld
is after my son.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.265
I want to know who.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.963
You mean a demon? Nah!

16:48.137 --> 16:50.226
I don't think so.
They know better by now.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.446
Obviously, somebody doesn't.

16:52.620 --> 16:57.668
Tell me, what makes you so sure
it's not an Elder?

16:57.842 --> 17:01.629
Someone who thinks that maybe
your friend Gideon was right.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.631
No more Elders
are gonna die by my hands.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.503
I can't say the same thing
for demons.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.245
Can you even tell
the difference anymore?

17:12.770 --> 17:17.297
You know, I'm kinda liking
this new side of you.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.863
It's not as goopy.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.952
Last time--
who's trying to kill my son?!

17:22.693 --> 17:24.478
You want an answer?

17:24.652 --> 17:26.219
You'll find it in there.

17:39.145 --> 17:43.584
Looks like the only threat
to your son is you.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.107
No! It's a lie!

17:45.281 --> 17:47.414
The Pool never lies!

17:48.284 --> 17:49.938
[grunts]

17:53.985 --> 17:55.074
Okay, try this.

17:55.248 --> 18:00.340
"Words that cast
a sibling glow..."

18:00.514 --> 18:02.777
Piper!

18:02.951 --> 18:05.432
What? I told you
I'm not doing this.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.216
I'm not writing
anything down.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.305
I'm not doing magic.

18:12.439 --> 18:16.138
Do you remember the first time
you were this age?

18:16.312 --> 18:20.751
When I sat you and your sisters
down and we had "the talk"?

18:20.925 --> 18:24.842
Grams, I already know
all about sex.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.541
And no offense, but I don't want
to talk about it with you

18:27.715 --> 18:29.543
'cause that's really gross!

18:29.717 --> 18:32.720
No, not the sex talk, silly.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.722
The witch talk.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.203
So what did you tell us?

18:37.377 --> 18:41.729
My being a witch was such
a important part of my life

18:41.903 --> 18:43.557
and what
it meant to me

18:43.731 --> 18:45.776
and what it might mean
to you someday.

18:49.780 --> 18:54.524
Did you tell us that Pru
and Mom were gonna die?

18:54.698 --> 18:57.484
Or that Leo was gonna
lose his marbles?

18:57.658 --> 19:00.226
Or that demons were
gonna be chasing after us

19:00.400 --> 19:02.793
all the time everywhere?

19:02.967 --> 19:06.928
Piper, I didn't know
any of those things

19:07.102 --> 19:10.410
were going to happen,
but if I did,

19:10.584 --> 19:13.021
I would have done everything
in my power

19:13.195 --> 19:14.327
to stop it.

19:16.894 --> 19:17.765
Baby...

19:21.160 --> 19:23.074
I'd like to think
that being a witch

19:23.249 --> 19:25.903
gave you the inner strength
you needed

19:26.077 --> 19:29.951
to deal with all those
sadnesses in your life.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.041
Did you ever think about that?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.390
No.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.654
You called?

19:38.786 --> 19:41.267
No, but hi!

19:41.441 --> 19:42.485
Victor called you.

19:42.659 --> 19:43.660
He's in the other room.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.054
Piper, where are you going?

19:46.228 --> 19:47.273
What's up?

19:47.447 --> 19:49.188
Oh, hey, Leo.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.233
Hey, you don't look so good.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.365
You know what, Dad?

19:52.539 --> 19:53.409
You could try
maybe being

19:53.583 --> 19:54.628
a little
bit nice to Leo.

19:54.802 --> 19:55.933
What do you
think, huh?

19:56.107 --> 19:57.108
Piper, you okay?
You don't seem...

19:57.283 --> 19:59.415
Oh, she's fine.
We're fixing it.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.590
Leo, we need you

20:00.764 --> 20:02.592
to take the boys
to Magic School

20:02.766 --> 20:04.028
for their safety.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.644
Do you have a problem with that?

20:12.428 --> 20:14.430
Never mind, we'll, uh,

20:14.604 --> 20:16.606
we'll just keep them here.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.304
I can take 'em.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.654
You don't look like you can.What are you saying?

20:20.828 --> 20:22.221
I don't know what's wrong
with you, Leo.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.527
Nothing is wrong with me!

20:25.746 --> 20:27.313
Where are you going?

20:27.487 --> 20:29.750
To protect my children.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.754
You know,
I don't understand

20:33.928 --> 20:35.669
why you guys have
to be so mean

20:35.843 --> 20:37.148
to Leo!

20:37.323 --> 20:38.933
You know,
in case you haven't heard,

20:39.107 --> 20:40.587
he's kind of going through
a hard time right about now!

20:40.761 --> 20:42.458
I mean, geez!

20:47.333 --> 20:50.336
We've gotta turn
these girls back fast.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.860
I'm gonna finish the spell
and get Paige.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.254
Uh, make yourself useful, okay?

20:55.428 --> 20:56.559
Get Phoebe.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.088
PHOEBE:
Oh, I'll take one of those.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.484
This is so cool.
They didn't even card me!

21:08.658 --> 21:10.399
Didn't expect to see you here.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.879
Yeah, well,

21:12.053 --> 21:13.533
I changed my mind
'cause it's my award

21:13.707 --> 21:15.535
and I'm not gonna share it
with anybody, so there!

21:15.709 --> 21:17.841
Phoebe, are you drunk?

21:18.015 --> 21:19.452
EMCEE:
If I could please have
everyone's attention!

21:19.626 --> 21:22.498
This year's winner

21:22.672 --> 21:24.979
of the San Francisco Reader's
Choice Award

21:25.153 --> 21:27.547
for Single Best Column is...

21:27.721 --> 21:31.115
the Bay Mirror's
Phoebe Halliwell.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.856
[applause]

21:33.030 --> 21:34.075
Phoebe, it's
not too late.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.381
If you stillwant me

21:35.555 --> 21:36.773
to go up there
for you, I can.

21:36.947 --> 21:37.948
Yeah, nice try.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.563
Thank you.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.130
Wow, this, I mean,
this is so awesome.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.395
This is so, like, totally
amazingly awesome!

21:49.569 --> 21:51.832
Really totally awesome! Thanks.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.617
REPORTER:
In your column...

21:54.791 --> 21:58.404
Yeah, you mean the bestest
column in all the world?

21:58.578 --> 22:02.408
Yes. You gave great advice
to that woman.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.105
I'm just curious,

22:04.279 --> 22:05.715
was it based on something
that happened to you?

22:05.889 --> 22:06.803
Uh...

22:06.977 --> 22:08.283
yeah, actually.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.241
It did happen to me,
it was very sad.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.330
Okay, next question.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.201
Wait, wait...

22:13.375 --> 22:14.681
would you mind
telling me what that thing was?

22:14.855 --> 22:17.074
You mean... you mean
what happened to me?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.859
It was actually something

22:19.033 --> 22:20.469
that happened to me.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.515
If I can answer
the question?
Oh, yeah.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.908
I'm... I'm lucky enough
to work with Phoebe

22:25.082 --> 22:26.127
at the paper.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.215
Anyway,
a few years back,

22:27.389 --> 22:28.608
this girl, she dumped me

22:28.782 --> 22:30.261
and I was really
broken up about it

22:30.436 --> 22:32.394
'cause I thought she
was the one, you know.

22:32.568 --> 22:33.961
And the whole thingmade me

22:34.135 --> 22:36.224
gun shy about relationships,

22:36.398 --> 22:39.227
and so anyway, Phoebe takes me
aside one day and she says...

22:39.401 --> 22:41.490
she says, "Let me tell you
about 'the one.'

22:41.664 --> 22:43.362
"The one is the person

22:43.536 --> 22:44.972
"who sees you for
the idiot you are,

22:45.146 --> 22:46.669
"but they still want
you in their life.

22:46.843 --> 22:47.931
That's the 'one.'"

22:48.105 --> 22:49.324
And I told her,
I said, "Phoebe,

22:49.498 --> 22:50.543
"I think that's
great advice,

22:50.717 --> 22:52.066
and not...
not just for me."

22:52.240 --> 22:53.241
And I guess
that's really

22:53.415 --> 22:55.417
how it got
in her column.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.724
[applause]

22:57.898 --> 23:00.422
Thank you, yeah, that's...
that's what happened.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.859
[applause]

23:03.033 --> 23:04.861
Thank you.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.473
Oh, my God.

23:07.647 --> 23:08.952
Oh, my God, Leslie,
thank you so much.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.564
I was so scared up there
and I was so nervous

23:11.738 --> 23:13.261
that I thought
I was going to hurl.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.350
Uh, you're welcome.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.308
Are you all right?
You still seem a little...

23:19.833 --> 23:21.878
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:22.052 --> 23:25.055
I can't believe
I just hugged you.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.709
I have to go.

23:32.933 --> 23:33.890
Ben?

23:34.935 --> 23:36.197
Miss Matthews.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.242
Yeah, stop calling me
Miss Matthews. Paige.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.940
Okay, uh... Paige,

23:40.114 --> 23:41.942
is there something
that I can help you with?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.465
I would actually
like to talk to you

23:43.639 --> 23:44.945
for a little bit if I could?

23:48.470 --> 23:49.645
Paige,
what's going on?

23:49.819 --> 23:51.299
What'd you call me
out here for?

23:56.522 --> 23:57.827
That.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.702
Oh, my God,
how old are you anyway?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.573
21.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.053
Okay, big mistake.

24:06.227 --> 24:07.576
No.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.099
One kiss, okay.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.318
Shh, that's it.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.450
We're not going
to second base.

24:11.624 --> 24:12.886
Oh, come on...

24:13.060 --> 24:14.975
She said no.

24:15.149 --> 24:18.805
Robbing the cradle, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.459
Come along, dear.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.112
Time to grow up.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.984
I'll dream about you.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.308
Wyatt!

24:47.921 --> 24:48.965
Ahh!

24:51.664 --> 24:53.013
[grunting]

25:11.248 --> 25:12.423
What... ?

25:12.598 --> 25:13.555
[footsteps approaching]

25:38.754 --> 25:39.886
This is Leslie.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.409
Hello?

25:41.583 --> 25:42.584
Hello?

25:43.759 --> 25:44.891
All right, give it to me,

25:45.065 --> 25:46.109
I'm calling
him myself.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.111
No, don't you dare.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.418
Phoebe, do you want to know
if he likes you or not?
Yeah.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.290
But wait! If he asks,
I'm not here okay,

25:53.464 --> 25:54.944
I'm not even in
the house anywhere.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.555
Okay, already.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.165
Okay.

25:58.339 --> 25:59.819
♪ Phoebe and Leslie
sitting in a tree ♪

25:59.993 --> 26:01.908
♪K-I-S-S-I... ♪
No!Give it to me!

26:02.082 --> 26:03.387
No!

26:03.562 --> 26:04.824
Ahh...! Hey!

26:04.998 --> 26:06.739
Stay here.
Protect the boys.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.437
You, come with me.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.444
Close the door.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.489
I found the demon
who's after Wyatt.

26:18.664 --> 26:19.752
You did?

26:19.926 --> 26:22.058
When? Where?

26:22.232 --> 26:23.930
There he is!

26:24.104 --> 26:25.453
No, you're making
a huge mistake.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.629
Get out of here, Leo,
I'm warning you.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.326
Betty, what the hell
are you talking about?

26:29.500 --> 26:32.460
I saw this monster
attack Wyatt at Magic School.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.940
That wasn't me.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.332
Well, it sure as hell
looked like you.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.334
I know, it...
Look, I can explain.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.294
It must have been some kind of
shape shifter or something.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.122
I don't know
any shape shifters

26:42.296 --> 26:44.341
who can enter Magic School
or any who have elders' powers.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.604
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you saying?

26:45.778 --> 26:46.909
Well, he attacked me,
remember?

26:47.083 --> 26:48.215
I was trying
to protect Wyatt.

26:48.389 --> 26:49.912
Yes, from yourself.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.174
I hate it
when they fight.

26:51.348 --> 26:52.480
It's 'cause of
the stupid magic,

26:52.654 --> 26:53.742
it's ruining our lives.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.135
It's already
ruined mine

26:55.309 --> 26:56.658
because now Leslie
knows I like him

26:56.832 --> 26:58.268
and I can never
leave the house again.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.705
Shh, shh, shh.

26:59.879 --> 27:00.793
This is my son
we're talking about.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.577
I would never hurt him.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.535
Just like you would
never hurt an elder?

27:04.710 --> 27:05.580
Or kill one?

27:05.754 --> 27:07.974
Who are you talking about?

27:08.148 --> 27:09.889
I think you know
who I'm talking about.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.152
Gideon.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.458
Look, I don't care
what you say,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.199
Leo's right.
He would never hurt his son.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.287
And how would you know?

27:17.461 --> 27:18.724
Because I'm a father.

27:18.898 --> 27:19.986
Victor...

27:20.160 --> 27:22.379
you have absolutely no idea

27:22.553 --> 27:24.381
what the magical world
is capable of.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.948
He may not
have an idea,

27:26.122 --> 27:27.297
but I do.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.169
I am not capable of that.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.173
No?

27:33.347 --> 27:35.523
Even after all
you've been through?

27:35.697 --> 27:37.351
Look at yourself.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.962
Is it so hard to believe

27:40.136 --> 27:42.791
that maybe some dark
alter ego of yours

27:42.965 --> 27:44.750
might be acting on
your true feelings?

27:44.924 --> 27:46.621
What true feelings?

27:46.795 --> 27:50.494
That maybe deep down inside
you think Gideon was right.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.497
Your son doesn't belong
in this world.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.760
That's ridiculous.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.805
Is it?

27:56.979 --> 27:59.721
Then how else do you
explain what happened?

27:59.895 --> 28:01.767
Where else could that

28:01.941 --> 28:03.769
demon have come from?

28:13.169 --> 28:14.693
Change of plans.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.738
We're not reversing
the rivalry spell.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.218
Or at least not yet.

28:18.392 --> 28:19.959
Why not?
I thought...

28:20.133 --> 28:21.090
No, listen...

28:21.264 --> 28:23.745
if adult Piper were to find out

28:23.919 --> 28:27.096
that Leo was trying to harm
Wyatt, it would devastate her.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.098
She wouldn't be able
to fight him off.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.491
Well, we're talking about
my daughter here,

28:30.665 --> 28:31.971
so I get a say in this.

28:32.145 --> 28:35.452
No, with birthdays and holidays
you get a say.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.585
With magic and demons,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.021
what I say goes.

28:39.195 --> 28:42.242
Now, if you'll excuse me.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.035
I told the girls
to stay downstairs

28:53.209 --> 28:54.297
until we settle this.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.690
There's nothing to settle.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.431
Now if you don't mind,

28:57.605 --> 28:58.649
I'm demon-proofing
the attic.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.173
I want to keep
the children safe.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.175
Wait.

29:02.349 --> 29:05.439
Believe it or not,
I really appreciate

29:05.613 --> 29:06.919
what you've done
for my daughters.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.182
Buttering me up
won't do you any good.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.010
I'm not reversing the spell.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.795
I don't expect you to.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.928
But I do expect you to
understand that even though

29:16.102 --> 29:17.930
I couldn't be there
when they were growing up,

29:18.104 --> 29:20.280
I'm here now.
And just like you,

29:20.454 --> 29:21.890
I want to do what's
best for them.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.500
We already are.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.024
No we're not.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.808
And since I want
to reverse the spell,

29:26.982 --> 29:28.462
and you don't,

29:28.636 --> 29:32.118
I think we should bring
in a third party to, um...

29:32.292 --> 29:33.815
break the tie, so to speak.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.512
A third party?Mm-hm.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.427
Who'd you have in mind,
their mother?

29:37.601 --> 29:38.951
[laughing]

29:39.125 --> 29:41.780
Yes. That's exactly
who I had in mind.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.304
Do it.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.262
Oh, all right.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.613
But she's not going to side
with you, you know.

29:53.835 --> 29:54.967
Mom.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.100
Victor.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.232
Wow.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.668
Patty, you look great.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.061
Oh, stop trying

30:02.235 --> 30:03.410
to sweet-talk her.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.020
What's going on?

30:06.587 --> 30:11.766
There's nothing more I can
tell you about the demon.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.900
You can tell me
where it came from.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.032
I have to know,
did it come from me?

30:17.206 --> 30:18.294
Tell me.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.471
Oh, what's the matter?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.647
Are you in pain?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.345
Please, I...

30:25.519 --> 30:27.303
See, I have a problem.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.392
You kind of have a temper.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.525
And if I don't
tell you, then well,

30:31.699 --> 30:33.309
you'll probably
choke me to death.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.921
And if I do tell you,
and you don't like the answer,

30:36.095 --> 30:38.445
well then, you'll probably
choke me to death.

30:38.619 --> 30:39.794
I won't hurt you.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.927
Yeah, that's not much
of a guarantee.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.407
But... you could

30:44.581 --> 30:47.758
swear on the head
of your precious son.

30:47.933 --> 30:48.934
Leave him out of this.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.937
There's that
temper thing.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.287
I'm not leaving here
until I get an answer.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.253
I'm telling you, she
would never get over it,

31:04.427 --> 31:06.952
her own husband trying
to kill their child?

31:07.126 --> 31:08.736
Oh, bull! We don't even
know that it's Leo.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.303
Mom...What if it is?

31:10.477 --> 31:12.261
You'd trust Leo to look after
those boys?

31:12.435 --> 31:14.002
Well, better than keeping
them locked up in a closet

31:14.176 --> 31:15.351
for the rest
of their lives.
Okay, guys!

31:15.525 --> 31:17.049
Can I just say here that...No.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.268
Victor's right.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.269
Patty.
No, Mom.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.444
We have to reverse

31:21.618 --> 31:22.968
the siblings' spell

31:23.142 --> 31:24.708
and get the girls
back to being adults,

31:24.883 --> 31:27.755
so that they can vanquish
this thing, whoever it is.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.278
But the danger to Piper...

31:29.452 --> 31:32.020
She's in more danger
if we don't.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.284
Listen, Patty,
I know these girls.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.678
I've been with them
every step of the way.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.071
But we're
their parents.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.120
Oh.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.469
Oh, well, then, fine.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.862
[gasps]:
Mom.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.430
I can see I'm not needed here.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.561
No, come on, come on.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.650
I-I... [groans]

31:55.348 --> 31:57.176
She always was a bad loser.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.396
Well... she'll get over it.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.443
By the way, Victor,
I have a question.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.358
Why'd you call on me
to settle this?

32:05.532 --> 32:07.708
Girls were in trouble
and, um...

32:07.882 --> 32:09.666
you were the only person
I could think of,

32:09.840 --> 32:10.667
dead or alive.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.582
Hmm. Still...

32:12.756 --> 32:14.193
it was teenage trouble,

32:14.367 --> 32:16.804
that's kind of unfamiliar
territory for us.

32:16.978 --> 32:20.721
Look, I... know we had
our troubles, but...

32:20.895 --> 32:23.506
I think that if we'd been
given the chance,

32:23.680 --> 32:26.596
we'd have done a really good job
raising those girls.

32:28.772 --> 32:29.904
You want to see 'em?

32:30.078 --> 32:31.340
Are you kidding?

32:31.514 --> 32:32.472
[chuckles]

32:32.646 --> 32:34.604
Wait, wait, wait.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.084
When you said
the girls reverted,

32:36.258 --> 32:37.738
what exactly
did you mean?

32:37.912 --> 32:39.783
You'll see.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.916
Mommy!

32:42.090 --> 32:43.613
Hi, Mommy!Hi, Mommy!

32:43.787 --> 32:46.094
Mommy, let's sing
a song, 'kay?

32:46.268 --> 32:48.270
I see the problem.

32:48.444 --> 32:49.793
Well, there's
another problem.
Excuse me!

32:49.968 --> 32:51.621
Your mother took
the reversal spell.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.232
That's okay,
I've got one of my own.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.581
Okay, girls, girls,

32:54.755 --> 32:55.756
calm down.Mommy, I met this boy

32:55.930 --> 32:57.627
and he's really really cute.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.282
We'll talk about the boy later.
And everything else, 'cause

33:00.456 --> 33:01.980
we've got so much
to catch up on,

33:02.154 --> 33:03.807
but right now, I need you girls
to stand over there.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.287
Is Leo a demon?

33:05.461 --> 33:07.681
Now! Please.Okay.

33:07.855 --> 33:08.769
She said now, Phoebe.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.901
I heard her, Piper!

33:11.076 --> 33:11.902
Okay, okay...

33:12.077 --> 33:13.295
Today, Phoebe!

33:13.469 --> 33:15.428
PHOEBE:
You're so bossy.

33:16.864 --> 33:20.215
Reverse the spell from The Book
and please restore

33:20.389 --> 33:22.087
what was... took.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.872
I made it up
when I was nine.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.008
[gurgling]

33:31.487 --> 33:32.793
VICTOR:
So how does this work exactly?

33:32.967 --> 33:34.360
You remember everything
that happened?

33:34.534 --> 33:36.144
Oh, my God.

33:36.318 --> 33:37.798
Yes.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.147
Leslie.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.845
Oh, my goodness,
I tongued a student.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.196
Piper, there's something
I've got to tell you

33:44.370 --> 33:45.762
about Wyatt and Leo.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.634
No, Dad, I already know,
and you're right.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.505
Leo would never hurt Wyatt.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.640
We overheard everything
you guys were talking about.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.294
PIPER:
Okay, let's go.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.122
We've got a demon to kill
and a child to save.

34:03.345 --> 34:06.696
That's our girl.
Hmm.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.742
PIPER:
Are you sure

34:08.916 --> 34:10.352
this is going to work?

34:10.526 --> 34:12.354
How many times are you
going to ask me that?

34:12.528 --> 34:14.139
Sorry, just nervous.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.445
I just wish we knew
what the hell was going on.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.752
Yeah, well, whatever
is going on,

34:18.926 --> 34:22.451
I'm pretty sure the demon
has something to do with Leo.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.498
What? I'm just saying.

34:25.672 --> 34:27.717
Do you ever wonder
what it would have been like

34:27.891 --> 34:30.285
if Mom and Dad
both raised us?

34:30.459 --> 34:32.809
All the time.

34:38.728 --> 34:39.642
Oh, my God.

34:39.816 --> 34:40.861
PAIGE:
Piper, it's not Leo.

34:41.035 --> 34:41.775
Throw the potion.

34:45.126 --> 34:45.996
Okay, that
should've worked.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.128
Piper!

34:55.441 --> 34:57.530
You promised that the
potion would work.

34:57.704 --> 34:58.922
It was supposed to.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.620
I couldn't have
made it any stronger.

35:00.794 --> 35:01.925
PIPER:
Well, why didn't it?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.536
Are you kidding me?

35:03.710 --> 35:04.972
We can't stop someone
from stealing my son?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.408
Okay, you need
to calm down

35:06.582 --> 35:08.932
and just try to focus
on how to find them.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.283
Girls, I think your mother
may be on to something here.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.894
It's just that this seems
somehow vaguely familiar to me,

35:14.068 --> 35:15.069
that's all.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.244
Familiar how?

35:16.418 --> 35:17.898
I'm not sure.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.553
You said you saw the demon
appear at Magic School.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.598
Do you know what Wyatt
was doing before?

35:22.772 --> 35:23.773
Sleeping?

35:23.947 --> 35:26.559
Or maybe dreaming.

35:26.733 --> 35:27.995
VICTOR:
He also appeared

35:28.169 --> 35:29.518
in the attic when
everyone was arguing.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.303
In front of Wyatt.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.566
The demon showed up right after
Grams snapped at Wyatt.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.655
Would somebody please tell me
what's going on?

35:37.613 --> 35:39.615
When you were a little girl,

35:39.789 --> 35:42.314
right after your father
and I split up...

35:42.488 --> 35:44.011
You started having
a lot of bad dreams.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.273
Doctor called them
"night terrors."

35:45.447 --> 35:47.275
He said it was
your subconscious way

35:47.449 --> 35:49.016
of blaming yourself
for our breakup.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.844
You're saying Piper
is the cause of your divorce?

35:51.018 --> 35:53.673
No, no, no, of course not.

35:53.847 --> 35:54.717
It was...

35:54.891 --> 35:56.589
Other things.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.286
PIPER:
Right, yeah.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.201
All this family history
stuff is really interesting,

36:00.375 --> 36:02.421
but how is this gonna
help us find Wyatt?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.250
I think what
they're saying

36:05.424 --> 36:07.121
is it's the same thing.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.342
Wyatt is blaming himself just
like you blamed yourself.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.648
Except because Wyatt
is so powerful,

36:12.822 --> 36:14.650
he made his night terrors
come to life

36:14.824 --> 36:15.825
whenever he felt conflict.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.218
PIPER:
Why would he make

36:17.392 --> 36:19.264
something up to
hurt himself?

36:19.438 --> 36:20.613
And why Leo?

36:20.787 --> 36:22.528
LEO:
Because...

36:22.702 --> 36:25.008
I'm the bad guy.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.489
As far as he's concerned,
if I hadn't killed Gideon

36:27.663 --> 36:29.839
and saved him,
I wouldn't be so lost.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.972
I'd be around here,
I'd be home.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.582
He thinks it's all his fault.

36:33.756 --> 36:34.670
That's ridiculous.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.716
No, it's not.

36:36.890 --> 36:37.934
I can relate.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.114
How did you figure
this all out?

36:44.289 --> 36:47.292
Let's just say somebody
helped me look in the mirror.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.032
So how do we find him?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.687
We go to where he thinks
it all started.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.560
Where I killed Gideon.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.608
This is gonna get your Mommy
and Daddy back together,

36:59.782 --> 37:01.306
one way or the other.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.308
That's what you want
most of all, isn't it?

37:08.487 --> 37:10.445
[hissing]

37:11.751 --> 37:13.143
[hissing]

37:15.624 --> 37:17.626
[screaming]

37:20.673 --> 37:21.630
[screams]

37:28.768 --> 37:31.074
It's not your fault, Wyatt.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.686
None of this is.

37:33.860 --> 37:34.948
You didn't do anything wrong.

37:37.385 --> 37:41.607
I'm the reason things are
all messed up... and not you.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.960
And you and Chris and Mommy
mean everything to me.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.269
You're the things that keep me
from falling apart.

37:55.795 --> 37:58.319
Come on, baby, come home.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.409
Daddy's not going anywhere,
I promise.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.648
I'm so sorry.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.084
It's not your fault,

38:24.258 --> 38:25.607
it's not anybody's fault.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.305
Still, I don't know what to do.

38:27.479 --> 38:30.786
I... don't know how
to find my way again.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.354
Yes, you do,
you just have to try.

38:43.277 --> 38:45.279
[typing]

38:54.244 --> 38:55.115
Can I come in?

38:55.289 --> 38:57.073
Sure, it's your office.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.684
May I sit down?

38:58.858 --> 39:00.729
Please, please.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.036
Um...

39:03.210 --> 39:07.388
I just came by to thank you
for what you did yesterday.

39:07.562 --> 39:08.998
What, are you kidding me?

39:09.172 --> 39:10.478
After that nice, long hug,

39:10.652 --> 39:12.219
I figured I came out
ahead on the deal.

39:12.393 --> 39:15.962
Yeah, that-that was, uh,
the three martinis talking.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.747
Well, you had wine

39:18.921 --> 39:21.184
and just one glass,
but anyway...

39:21.359 --> 39:24.057
Well, I-I hugged you
because I was just,

39:24.231 --> 39:25.667
you know, grateful
for what you did.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.713
I don't know, you squeezed me
pretty tight.

39:27.887 --> 39:28.975
Yeah, I was pretty grateful.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.498
Come on, there was nothing else

39:30.672 --> 39:31.760
besides gratitude
behind that hug?

39:31.934 --> 39:33.806
What would you like there to be?

39:33.980 --> 39:36.548
Just admit it-- you like me.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.376
How can you be so sure of that?

39:38.550 --> 39:42.075
Oh, I don't know,
the 28 phone calls in two hours.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.599
Caller ID.

39:46.732 --> 39:51.214
Yeah, well, that was because
my redial button was broken.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.521
So it just kept
redialing and...Ah...

39:53.695 --> 39:55.697
Yeah, and you were the last
number I called, you know.

39:55.871 --> 39:56.785
So it just...

39:56.959 --> 39:59.397
Right.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.878
Well, thank you.

40:12.018 --> 40:15.282
If she turns around,
it means she likes me.

40:15.456 --> 40:19.199
Come on, Phoebe,
don't let me down.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.809
You can do it. Turn around.

40:26.293 --> 40:28.426
That'a girl.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.180
Are you okay?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.356
Yeah.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.448
It's just...

40:50.622 --> 40:52.493
leaving's always
the hardest part.

40:52.667 --> 40:53.842
Well, maybe I
shouldn't have.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.888
No, no, no,
I'm glad you did.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.368
I wanted to be here
for this, for them.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.981
It's just...

41:02.155 --> 41:04.287
hard, you know.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.941
The price I pay
for being dead I guess.

41:06.115 --> 41:07.682
[chuckles]

41:11.904 --> 41:15.385
We missed a lot.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.431
Not being able
to raise them together.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.129
I know.

41:21.391 --> 41:22.567
But we made up for it

41:22.741 --> 41:24.220
a little bit today, didn't we?

41:24.394 --> 41:25.787
Yeah.

41:25.961 --> 41:27.528
PIPER:All right already,
break it up.

41:27.702 --> 41:28.747
Kids entering.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.226
PAIGE:Grams?

41:30.400 --> 41:32.185
You coming down?

41:32.359 --> 41:33.578
Oh, she's being
a martyr.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.668
Grams, please?

41:36.842 --> 41:38.104
Last call, woman!

41:38.278 --> 41:39.366
GRAMS:
Oh, very well.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.586
Just so we're clear,

41:41.760 --> 41:42.717
my way would have

41:42.891 --> 41:44.110
worked, too.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.503
Nevertheless,
you're all forgiven.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.680
Except Leo.Why not me?

41:48.854 --> 41:51.596
Because I owe you the apology.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.641
I'm sorry I thought
you were evil.

41:54.686 --> 41:55.600
Not that you could blame me.

41:55.774 --> 41:57.515
That's an apology?

41:57.689 --> 41:58.994
I'd take it if I were you.

41:59.168 --> 41:59.952
PIPER:All right,
let's do this

42:00.126 --> 42:01.475
before I change my mind.

42:12.965 --> 42:14.488
"I call forth

42:14.662 --> 42:17.186
"from space and time,

42:17.360 --> 42:20.015
"matriarchs from
the Halliwell line.

42:20.189 --> 42:23.584
"Mothers, daughters,
sisters, friends.

42:23.758 --> 42:26.761
Our family spirit
without end."
