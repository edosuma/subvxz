HOMECOMING QUEEN DEBACLE.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.667

THEY VOTED FOR AN OUTSIDER.

YOUR SISTER'S IDEA

02:49.750 --> 02:52.333

A BED AND BREAKFAST,

03:07.667 --> 03:09.708
OK, POTTER, WHAT'S UP?

03:09.708 --> 03:13.667
WELL, CONSIDERING THAT
A LOT OF OUR INSURANCE MONEY

03:13.667 --> 03:16.625
IS GOING TO BE
SWALLOWED UP IN THIS,

03:16.625 --> 03:18.125

WORKS OUT.

ABOUT HER,

AND I TRIED TO WARN HER,

03:33.417 --> 03:36.375

HE FIRED ME THE NEXT DAY.

INCAPABLE OF LYING WITH

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
GET OFF ME.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.834
IF YOU SO MUCH
AS TOUCH HER AGAIN,

11:59.834 --> 12:02.708
I AM GOING TO NAIL
YOU TO A CROSS.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.291
WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T
EVEN LAY A HAND ON HER.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.041
OH, HEY, SAVE IT FOR
THE JUDGE, LOGAN, HUH?

12:07.041 --> 12:08.417
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

12:19.417 --> 12:21.041
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL
IN HERE.

12:21.041 --> 12:26.041
ISN'T IT? YOU'RE LOOKING
AT OVER 200 PLANTS.

12:26.041 --> 12:30.208
BULBOPHYLLUM
VIRGINALIS.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.250
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.625
NO, I'M NOT. I SWEAR.

12:33.625 --> 12:37.291
SOMETIMES THEY GET
A LITTLE SUGGESTIVE
WITH THE NAMES.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.667
OK, GIMME ANOTHER ONE.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.708
OK, HOW ABOUT...

12:40.708 --> 12:45.000
POLYSTACHYA PUBESCENS?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.417
OR...
VANDA VAGINATUM?

12:49.417 --> 12:51.667
OOH, IS IT
HOT IN HERE,

12:51.667 --> 12:54.333
OR DID YOU JUST
MAKE ME BLUSH?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.250
OH.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.125
RELAX, HENRY. IT'LL
TAKE A LOT MORE THAN
A FLOWER TO OFFEND ME.

12:59.125 --> 13:03.166
HMM, HOW DID YOU LEARN
SO MUCH ABOUT THESE?

13:03.166 --> 13:04.583
MISS FRECKLING.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.750
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HER?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.542
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:09.542 --> 13:12.750
SHE'S WOUND
SO TIGHT, SHE'S LIKE
A VIOLIN STRING.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.792
NO, SHE'S...
SHE'S JUST SAD.

13:16.792 --> 13:17.667
SAD?

13:17.667 --> 13:18.792
SHE'S GOT NO ONE
IN HER LIFE.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.917
SHE NEVER HAD KIDS,
NO RELATIVES.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.208
I'VE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO HER
FOR 10 YEARS.

13:24.208 --> 13:26.125
I THINK I'M HER BEST FRIEND.

13:26.125 --> 13:29.333
I DON'T KNOW WHO
TO FEEL SORRIER FOR,

13:29.333 --> 13:31.166
YOU OR HER.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.542
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TOUGHEN YOU UP.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.750
YOU KEEP WEARING YOUR
HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE
LIKE THAT,

13:38.750 --> 13:40.166
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BLEED TO DEATH.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.458
IT'S NOT ME. IT'S...

13:41.458 --> 13:43.542
IT'S HER.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.959
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU.

13:46.959 --> 13:47.625
SHE WAS?

13:47.625 --> 13:50.041
I TOLD HER ALL ABOUT YOU.

13:50.041 --> 13:53.959
SEE. THE THING IS,
SHE HAS EXACTLY 2 EVENTS
ON HER SOCIAL CALENDAR--

13:53.959 --> 13:57.667
THE W.O.C. IN MIAMI
EVERY SPRING--

13:57.667 --> 13:58.917
W.O.C.?

13:58.917 --> 14:00.625
THE WORLD ORCHID CONFERENCE.

14:00.625 --> 14:04.291
AND IN THE FALL,
THE HOMECOMING QUEEN
GALA.

14:04.291 --> 14:06.834
IT'S WHAT SHE LIVES FOR.

14:06.834 --> 14:11.083
WITHOUT THEM...
SHE'S GOT NOTHING AT ALL.

14:14.792 --> 14:19.667
LOOK, UM, YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE STATION TONIGHT.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.917
UH-UH, I CAN'T
GO TO THE STATION.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.250
ANDIE, YOU HAVE TO.

14:23.250 --> 14:26.166
YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO THE POLICE.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.667
JOEY, IT'S NOT
LIKE HE ACTUALLY
DID ANYTHING.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.208
WELL, THEN,
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY HERE?

14:33.208 --> 14:35.792
I REALLY DON'T
THINK YOU SHOULD
BE ALONE TONIGHT.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.000
THANKS, BUT I CAN'T.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.625
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS, JO.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.583
YOU SURE?

14:52.417 --> 14:54.417
YEAH.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.166
OK.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.000
MISS FRECKLING?

15:05.041 --> 15:05.875
CONSTANCE?

15:05.875 --> 15:09.375
SHE'S GOT HER AID
TURNED OFF.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.041
AID?

15:11.041 --> 15:14.875
HEARING AID. SOMETIMES
SHE LIKES TO TUNE OUT
THE WORLD.

15:14.875 --> 15:18.959
[GASPS] OH, HANK,
YOU STARTLED ME. OH.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.625
I, UM, I RAN INTO
JEN OUTSIDE.

15:22.625 --> 15:26.417
MISS FRECKLING, I KNOW THAT
WE GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT,

15:26.417 --> 15:29.083
AND...I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF WE COULD START OVER.

15:29.083 --> 15:33.708
HE IS PERSUASIVE WHEN
HE WANTS TO BE, ISN'T HE?

15:33.708 --> 15:36.250
I...I...

15:37.583 --> 15:39.291
I'M JUST GETTING
TO KNOW HIM.

15:39.291 --> 15:43.750
WELL, IF HE LIKES YOU,
YOU CAN'T BE ALL BAD.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.917
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.834
SO, SHOULD WE WAIT FOR
THE WATERS TO CALM

15:48.834 --> 15:51.750
OR JUST DIVE RIGHT INTO
THE PARTY PLANNING?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.583
I SAY DIVE RIGHT IN.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.250
VERY WELL.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.583
UM, ENTERTAINMENT OR FOOD?

15:59.583 --> 16:02.458
TAKE YOUR PICK.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.125
UM...

16:04.125 --> 16:05.959
ENTERTAINMENT?

16:05.959 --> 16:08.583
AHH, SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

16:08.583 --> 16:12.875
NOW, SINCE IT'S MY HOUSE,
THERE ARE SOME RULES.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.583
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.125
NO MIMES, NO MAGICIANS,
NO BARRY MANILOW,

16:16.125 --> 16:19.875
NO ELVIS LOOK-ALIKES,
NO MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKERS,

16:19.875 --> 16:21.458
NO COMEDY TROUPES,
NO BREAK DANCING,

16:21.458 --> 16:23.375
NO GANGSTA RAP,
NO ANIMAL TRICKS--

16:23.375 --> 16:26.458
OK, NO NOTHING THAT
YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY
SEE ON LETTERMAN.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.542
WHAT'S LETTERMAN?

16:29.291 --> 16:31.291
HOW DOES
A STRING QUARTET

16:31.291 --> 16:33.583
PLAYING MOZART
STRIKE YOU?

16:33.583 --> 16:34.417
PERFECT.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.875
OK, I'LL SPLIT
THE DIFFERENCE.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.000
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.291
OH, AND THERE'S
ONE MORE THING.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.667
WHAT'S THAT?

16:42.667 --> 16:49.166
WELL, UH, HE DOESN'T
KNOW IT YET, BUT...
HANK HERE...

16:51.667 --> 16:53.125
IS GOING AS MY DATE.

16:58.708 --> 17:01.041
TRUE LOVE.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.792
THAT'S IRONIC.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
YEAH, WELL...

17:06.000 --> 17:08.040
I FIGURED SINCE
IT DIDN'T EXIST,

17:08.040 --> 17:11.290
I'D TRY AND CREATE
IT FOR MYSELF.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.458
WHY DID YOU
BRING ME HERE?

17:15.834 --> 17:21.165
BECAUSE...WELL,
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO GO SOMEPLACE QUIET.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.500
THERE'S LOTS OF
QUIET PLACES, PACEY.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.458
YEAH, I GUESS
THERE ARE, HEH.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.000
UM...

17:34.000 --> 17:37.708
I GUESS I JUST WANTED
TO SHOW YOU I'VE BEEN OK

17:37.708 --> 17:39.708
SINCE WE ENDED THINGS.

17:39.708 --> 17:42.959
I'VE FOUND A WAY
TO TURN WHAT'S
BEEN KILLING ME

17:42.959 --> 17:46.166
INTO SOMETHING
POTENTIALLY BEAUTIFUL.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.875
I HAVEN'T, PACEY.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.542
I'M NOT OVER YOU.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.041
YOU WILL BE, McPHEE.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.875
SEE, EVEN THAT--
JUST YOU CALLING ME
BY MY LAST NAME--

17:56.875 --> 17:59.542
DO YOU KNOW HOW
LONG I'VE WAITED
TO HEAR THAT?

17:59.542 --> 18:02.083
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT TONIGHT, ANDIE.
LET'S NOT GO THERE.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.208
IF IT TOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT

18:04.208 --> 18:07.667
TO BRING US TOGETHER,
THEN SO BE IT.

18:07.667 --> 18:08.834
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

18:08.834 --> 18:12.291
I MEAN, I'M HERE FOR YOU,
BUT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.917
IF WE'RE NOT
TOGETHER, THEN...

18:15.917 --> 18:18.041
I'M NOT SITTING
BESIDE YOU...

18:18.041 --> 18:21.542
STARING
INTO YOUR EYES...

18:23.625 --> 18:25.291
AND KISSING YOU.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.333
ANDIE...

18:32.166 --> 18:33.750
SORRY.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.000
WE JUST CAN'T.

18:37.583 --> 18:38.750
PHEW! WE CAN'T.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.250
FOR SO MANY REASONS,
WE CAN'T.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.500
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
WHAT WE CAN'T DO,
PACEY.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.208
I'M ASKING YOU
WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.208
I WANT TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OK.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.083
THAT'S ALL THAT
MATTERS TO ME NOW.

18:53.083 --> 18:57.083
THAT'S A SHAME BECAUSE
YOU STILL MATTER TO ME
IN EVERY WAY.

19:00.041 --> 19:02.458
I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU, PACEY.

19:02.458 --> 19:05.250
I KNOW THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW,

19:05.250 --> 19:07.125
BUT TOMORROW COULD
BE AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.583
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT TOMORROW.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.291
I'M TALKING
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

19:10.291 --> 19:15.125
TONIGHT. YOU
AND ME TOGETHER,
UNDER THE STARS...

19:15.125 --> 19:18.125
JUST LIKE IT
USED TO BE.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.959
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A KISS.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.500
THAT'S ALL
I'M ASKING.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.834
DON'T YOU WANT TO?

20:11.083 --> 20:14.500
THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF ME.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.166
RIGHT BACK
AT YOU, ANDIE.

20:17.166 --> 20:20.417
I JUST WANNA SAY,
FOR THE RECORD,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

20:20.417 --> 20:23.500
WHATEVER DID OR
DID NOT HAPPEN
BETWEEN US

20:23.500 --> 20:24.834
HAPPENED FOR A REASON,

20:24.834 --> 20:27.375
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM 100% OK WITH IT.

20:27.375 --> 20:30.208
AND WHEREVER IT MAY LEAD,
WHATEVER NEW STATUS
MAY RESULT--

20:30.208 --> 20:31.875
IT'S TOTALLY--
ANDIE.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.041
I'M RAMBLING.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.166
YEAH.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.542
WELL, IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT,
AND I'M SCARED,

20:37.542 --> 20:39.208
AND IN SCARED MOMENTS,
I RAMBLE.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.500
SOME PEOPLE DO THAT.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.041
SOMETIMES THEY RAMBLE
WHEN THEY'RE--
ANDIE.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.834
RAMBLING AGAIN.
RIGHT.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.166
I GUESS I JUST
WANNA KNOW

20:50.166 --> 20:52.333
THAT YOU'RE FEELING
WHAT I'M FEELING.

20:53.542 --> 20:54.834
I AM.

20:54.834 --> 20:56.166
[SIGHS]

20:56.166 --> 20:59.667
THAT MAKES ME
SO HAPPY.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.583
OK.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.083
DIDN'T YOU READ
THE SIGN?

21:31.083 --> 21:35.333
NO KNOWN SEX OFFENDERS
WITHIN 200 YARDS
OF MY PROPERTY.

21:35.333 --> 21:37.166
I DIDN'T DO IT!

21:37.166 --> 21:40.500
NOT BAD.
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE WORK

21:40.500 --> 21:41.625
ON THE DELIVERY,
HOWEVER.

21:41.625 --> 21:45.458
I SUGGEST
A LESS FORCEFUL
INTERPRETATION.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.667
JOEY, PLEASE,
JUST TELL ME...

21:49.083 --> 21:51.583
TELL ME SHE HASN'T
GONE TO THE POLICE.

21:51.583 --> 21:52.667
YOU TOUCH ME AGAIN,
AND I WILL SCREAM

21:52.667 --> 21:55.750
FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY
WILLIAM KENNEDY SMITH!

21:55.750 --> 21:59.458
LOOK, JOEY, SHE WAS
THE ONE THAT WANTED
TO GO UPSTAIRS, OK?

21:59.458 --> 22:01.291
SHE--SHE PRACTICALLY
DRAGGED ME UP
TO THAT ROOM.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.875
AND WHEN WE STARTED KISSING,

22:03.875 --> 22:05.625
I SWEAR,
SHE JUST FREAKED OUT.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.333
ROB, YOU DO NOT HAVE
A LOT OF CREDIBILITY
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.875
FINE. I ADMIT IT, OK?
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

22:10.875 --> 22:13.208
BETWEEN AN INAPPROPRIATE
WORKPLACE FLIRTATION--

22:13.208 --> 22:14.500
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.708
YOU DRAW YOUR OWN LINE
IN THE SAND, ROB.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.000
THEY ARE BOTH
AGAINST THE LAW.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.834
I HAVE NEVER FORCED
MYSELF ON ANYONE.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.750
IF YOU SAY SO.

22:26.750 --> 22:29.959
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT SHE'S UNSTABLE.

22:29.959 --> 22:33.500
NO SECRET THAT SHE
SPENT SOME TIME IN
A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.500
I'M GOING TO PRETEND
YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.667
THEN WHY WOULD SHE
DO THIS, HUH?

22:40.667 --> 22:43.792
THAT'S ALL I WANNA KNOW!
FOR WHAT POSSIBLE REASON?

22:57.708 --> 22:59.166
SPLENDID.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.041
SPLENDID.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.125
I WONDER
WHERE JEN IS.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.291
OH, DON'T LOOK NOW,

23:04.291 --> 23:06.583
BUT HERE COMES
MARILYN MENDICK
AND HER HUSBAND.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.375
I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM
IN YEARS.

23:08.375 --> 23:08.959
I CAN'T STAND
THAT WOMAN.

23:08.959 --> 23:11.625
OH...

23:11.625 --> 23:14.291
OH, GALE, DAWSON.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.500
NEIL, MARILYN.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.542
I HEARD ALL ABOUT
PHILADELPHIA.

23:18.542 --> 23:20.375
I'M SURE YOU DID.
EXCUSE US.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.375
WE WERE JUST
GONNA GET A DRINK.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.792
ACTUALLY, I'M QUITE
PROUD OF MY MOM.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.041
Marilyn:
OH, WE ALL ARE.

23:25.041 --> 23:27.375
EVEN IF PHILADELPHIA
DIDN'T QUITE AGREE
WITH HER.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.458
HONESTLY, I THINK IT'S
PERFECTLY ABSURD...

23:28.458 --> 23:30.583
TO FIRE AN ANCHOR
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC

23:30.583 --> 23:33.000
FELT SHE WAS TOO OLD
TO IDENTIFY WITH.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.959
OH, YOU WOULDN'T
HEAR THEM SAYING THAT
ABOUT DIANE SAWYER.

23:36.959 --> 23:40.333
Neil: GALE, I SPEAK FOR THE
WHOLE COUNTY WHEN I SAY

23:40.333 --> 23:43.250
YOU'D BE WELCOME BACK
ON OUR AIRWAVES ANYTIME.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.250
THANK YOU, NEIL.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.625
SHALL WE?

23:49.834 --> 23:52.417
MOM, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

24:01.458 --> 24:04.166
YOU'RE LATE.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.375
THE ENTERTAINMENT
STILL ISN'T HERE.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.667
AND THAT WARDROBE
IS FAR FROM
APPROPRIATE ATTIRE.

24:09.667 --> 24:13.667
I DEMAND YOU
RETURN HOME AND
CHANGE THIS INSTANT.

24:13.667 --> 24:17.041
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
SHE WOULD TURN THIS
INTO A TRAVESTY,

I PUT HIM UP TO IT.

TOLD YOUR DAD?

IT'S ONLY GONNA UPSET HIM,

DO YOU THINK
YOU OVERREACTED?

WELL, I DIDN'T CRY WOLF,

NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.959
HE TOLD ME HIS SIDE
OF THE STORY,

25:28.959 --> 25:31.917
AND HE BASICALLY GOT
DOWN ON HIS KNEES,
PLEADING HIS INNOCENCE.

SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.333

THAT SCUM.

I BELIEVED HIM.

NO? YOU JUST STOPPED
BY FOR A FRIENDLY

25:43.375 --> 25:47.125
NO. I STOPPED BY TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE DOING
THE RIGHT THING, ANDIE.

25:47.125 --> 25:50.959
LOOK, I SHOULD'VE REPORTED
THE GUY MYSELF, ABOUT
HIS BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ME.

PREVENTED THIS WHOLE THING.

GOOD CAME OUT OF IT.

WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT?

29:15.667 --> 29:19.917
WELL, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT'S HARDER TO REBUILD
SOMETHING

29:19.917 --> 29:21.166

START FROM SCRATCH.

UNEXPECTED HAPPENED.

FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I WAS ABLE TO SEE
PAST THE CLICHE,

ENJOYED BEING

33:41.417 --> 33:45.500
YOUR PRESENCE IN HIS LIFE
HAS AWAKENED HIM SOMEHOW.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.667
IT'S QUITE SPECIAL.

33:46.667 --> 33:51.417
THOUGH MY CONCERN IS
THE SENTIMENT'S NOT MUTUAL.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.708

34:06.458 --> 34:10.041
I WAS 17.
WE COURTED.

34:10.041 --> 34:12.041
HE ASKED ME
TO MARRY HIM.

34:12.041 --> 34:16.000
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE YESTERDAY.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.708
HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT,
GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE.

34:18.708 --> 34:23.291

GRAVE SITE ON THE
ANNIVERSARY OF HER DEATH.

WITH THE GIRL
WHO'D SOLD HIM
HIS CADILLAC.

34:54.583 --> 34:59.500

IS A FRAGILE THING.

MIGHT WELL NEVER RECOVER.

IN LOVE WITH ME.

36:12.959 --> 36:16.000
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

WHAT I FEEL?

36:18.500 --> 36:21.333
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE
IN LOVE WITH ME?

36:21.333 --> 36:24.083
BECAUSE I JUST--
I AM.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.917
I WISH IT WAS
THAT SIMPLE.

36:26.917 --> 36:29.291

IS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU
IN THE NEXT 2 YEARS

36:39.125 --> 36:40.708
IF YOU DO THEM RIGHT?

36:40.708 --> 36:45.000
YOUR HEART IS GONNA SWELL
AND BREAK A HUNDRED TIMES
BEFORE YOU TURN 16.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.875
HOW DOES THAT MAKE ME
ANY LESS READY FOR YOU NOW?

36:47.875 --> 36:52.333
I CAN STILL CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN ANYONE EVER HAS.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.625
NO OFFENSE, BUT THAT'S
NOT SAYING MUCH.

36:58.208 --> 37:01.000
THEN GIVE ME A SHOT.

HAVE TO LOSE?

NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

BUT WHO CAN ALSO
GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU.

THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE,
I HAVE.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.125
BUT YOU DON'T.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.542
WHICH LEADS ME
TO BELIEVE

37:33.542 --> 37:38.000
THAT EVERYTHING YOU
THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT
LOVE IS QUESTIONABLE.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.667
AND AS LONG AS IT IS,
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
I'M NOT THE ONE FOR YOU.

37:42.667 --> 37:47.291

TO KNOW ABOUT ME...

37:47.291 --> 37:49.583
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M
JUST BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND,

37:49.583 --> 37:55.166
IS THAT UNTIL I CAN LOOK
AT MYSELF WITHOUT JUDGMENT

37:55.166 --> 37:59.667
OR CONDEMNATION,
I'M NOT READY FOR ANYONE.

38:00.834 --> 38:02.458
LET ALONE YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU JUST SAID...

38:08.834 --> 38:12.333
ABOUT MY HEART BREAKING
A HUNDRED TIMES?

38:16.834 --> 38:18.917
WELL, THERE GOES
NUMBER ONE.

FEEL YOU COULD TELL ME.

TELL A SON,

BE TEACHING TO DREAM,

38:39.375 --> 38:41.291
THAT SHE FAILED
AT HER OWN?

38:41.291 --> 38:42.166
MOM.

38:42.166 --> 38:44.750
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DIDN'T FAIL.

38:44.750 --> 38:48.208
AND SECOND OF ALL,
YOU DON'T LOOK OLD.

38:48.208 --> 38:49.500
YOU LOOK GREAT.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.291
THANK YOU, HONEY.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.291
NOW, AS FOR COMING HOME...

38:54.291 --> 38:57.375
SWEETHEART,
I HAVE MY REASONS

38:57.375 --> 38:58.458
WHY I DON'T WANT TO
RACE BACK TO CAPESIDE.

38:58.458 --> 39:00.458
RIGHT. AND THAT'S
BETWEEN YOU AND DAD,

39:00.458 --> 39:03.333
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.708
BUT...

39:04.708 --> 39:08.750
BUT YOU THINK THAT
I SHOULD TALK TO HIM,
DON'T YOU?

39:08.750 --> 39:11.000
I JUST THINK YOU COULD USE
A FRIEND LIKE HIM RIGHT NOW.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.625
IT'S NOT THAT EASY,
DAWSON.

39:12.625 --> 39:15.000
THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH
HISTORY THERE.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.250
BUT THERE'S NO LAW
SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T,

39:17.250 --> 39:18.834
YOU KNOW,
LEAN ON HIM A LITTLE.

39:18.834 --> 39:22.375
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

39:22.375 --> 39:23.834
HE COULD HELP ME.

39:23.834 --> 39:26.834
WE COULD BECOME
FRIENDS AGAIN.

39:26.834 --> 39:27.458
HAH.

39:29.834 --> 39:30.667
GOD HELP US.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.542
YOU LIED TO ME.
YOU TOLD ME ONE THING
TO MY FACE,

39:35.542 --> 39:37.208
AND THEN YOU WENT
RIGHT BEHIND MY BACK.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.083
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND.

39:39.083 --> 39:40.667
I AM, ANDIE.

39:40.667 --> 39:41.959
OH, AND YOU HAVE SUCH
DEEP FEELINGS FOR ME

39:41.959 --> 39:44.500
THAT YOU WENT STRAIGHT TO PACEY
AND SABOTAGED EVERYTHING.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.166
PACEY? I HAVEN'T EVEN
TALKED TO PACEY

39:47.166 --> 39:50.041
SINCE YOU GUYS
DROPPED ME OFF.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.500
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

39:51.500 --> 39:52.458
WELL, IT'S THE TRUTH.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.375
OH, OK. SO IT'S
JUST A COINCIDENCE

39:55.375 --> 39:56.708
THAT ONE MINUTE
WE'RE TOGETHER

39:56.708 --> 39:58.917
AND THE NEXT HE NEVER
WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN?

39:58.917 --> 40:00.834
WHEN DID THIS
HAPPEN?

40:00.834 --> 40:01.291
TONIGHT.

40:01.291 --> 40:02.333
AN HOUR AGO.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.875
RIGHT AFTER YOU WENT
AND TOLD HIM

40:03.875 --> 40:06.708
THAT I MADE UP
THE ENTIRE STORY ABOUT ROB
JUST TO GET HIM BACK.

40:06.708 --> 40:11.917
LOOK. OK, ANDIE, I ADMIT
IT DID CROSS MY MIND.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.083
BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT,
NOT FOR A MINUTE.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.458
IS THAT RIGHT?

40:15.458 --> 40:17.875
LOOK, I KNOW YOU.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.041
I...

40:19.041 --> 40:22.917
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
A GOOD PERSON. YOU--

40:22.917 --> 40:27.667
YOU WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING SO HURTFUL
AND PLAINLY WRONG.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.625
WHAT?
WHAT DID I SAY?

40:37.291 --> 40:37.667
NOTHING.

40:39.166 --> 40:40.375
YOU CAN TELL ME, ANDIE.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.458
LOOK, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME, JOEY, OK?

40:42.458 --> 40:45.041
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF

40:45.041 --> 40:46.875
WHEN I SET MY SIGHTS
ON SOMETHING.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.500
ANDIE, YOU'RE A STUBBORN
AND DETERMINED PERSON.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.625
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

40:52.625 --> 40:56.583
NO! IT'S MORE.
IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT
BLINDERS ON.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.750
AND ALL I CAN SEE IS
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT
OF ME, WHAT I'M AFTER,

40:58.750 --> 41:02.625
AND EVERYTHING
ON THE EDGES JUST GETS
BLOCKED OUT SOMEHOW.

41:02.625 --> 41:05.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:05.125 --> 41:08.417
I'M TALKING ABOUT PACEY.

41:10.959 --> 41:14.583
I LOVE HIM,
AND I NEED HIM.

41:18.041 --> 41:19.625
AND THE TRUTH IS...

41:24.542 --> 41:27.750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE TRUTH IS ANYMORE.

41:40.458 --> 41:40.667
IT'S OK.

41:51.959 --> 41:55.291
[LAUGHTER
AND CHATTER]

42:06.458 --> 42:08.458
CHEERS.
CHEERS.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.917
[TALKING SOFTLY]
