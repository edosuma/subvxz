Excellent knock-down
power, but the trade-off

12:35.646 --> 12:37.147
is that it's large and heavy.

12:37.181 --> 12:39.950
It's a got an 8-round magazine, loaded.

12:39.984 --> 12:42.085
And I'm gonna give you an extra.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.920
Let's hope you won't need it.

12:43.955 --> 12:45.555
And lastly, the suppressor.
It's highly effective.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.457
Without it, you'll wake up the entire ship.

12:47.525 --> 12:50.093
- But you need time to attach it.
- Are we clear?

12:50.128 --> 12:52.896
- Crystal.
- Outstanding.

13:05.009 --> 13:06.576
Thank you.

13:11.149 --> 13:14.084
If anything should happen...

13:14.118 --> 13:15.886
Finish what we started.

13:17.789 --> 13:20.991
[Door opens]

13:26.297 --> 13:28.598
The Russians are picking
you up in one of their helos

13:28.666 --> 13:30.834
out in the middle of nowhere,
taking you to their ship.

13:30.868 --> 13:32.235
We won't have any contact after that.

13:32.303 --> 13:34.171
- I understand.
- [Huffs]

13:35.540 --> 13:39.509
It's a little late to ask if
you really want to do this.

13:39.544 --> 13:41.178
Let me just say,

13:41.212 --> 13:45.182
what you're doing is... Very brave.

13:45.216 --> 13:46.650
I'm proud to know you.

13:48.319 --> 13:50.620
You're making it sound like good-bye.

13:52.256 --> 13:53.723
I'll see you for breakfast.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.743
[Lowered voice] How
about, uh, "Great Escape"?

14:10.743 --> 14:12.811
[Lowered voice] Kinda hard
to tunnel out of a ship.

14:12.845 --> 14:14.713
Yeah, you got a point there.

14:14.781 --> 14:16.815
You ever see "Papillon"?

14:16.849 --> 14:18.383
Are we just doing Steve McQueen flicks?

14:18.451 --> 14:19.618
What about "Escape from Alcatraz"?

14:19.652 --> 14:21.286
You'd need a dummy.

14:21.354 --> 14:23.855
What about, uh, Bad English over there?

14:23.923 --> 14:26.291
What are you talking of?! Quiet!

14:48.181 --> 14:49.448
Take off.

15:03.663 --> 15:05.163
Turn around.

15:15.475 --> 15:16.675

[Door opens]

16:21.908 --> 16:23.575
Dr. Scott.

16:23.643 --> 16:27.512
How long I've waited to
welcome you aboard <i>Vyerni.</i>

16:27.547 --> 16:30.148
I won't be talking further

16:30.216 --> 16:31.816
or doing any kind of work

16:31.884 --> 16:33.552
until you bring up your prisoners.

16:33.586 --> 16:35.720
Of course. It was expected.

16:41.761 --> 16:44.296
What the hell are you doing here?

16:46.232 --> 16:47.599
Huh?

16:50.069 --> 16:51.303
Ohh!

16:55.007 --> 16:56.608
Now I understand

16:56.642 --> 16:59.110
why the good Doctor
agreed to pay us a visit.

- [Speaks Russian]
- [Grunts]

17:01.781 --> 17:03.582
- [Door opens]
- The deal was me for them.

17:03.616 --> 17:05.550
You gave your word that you'd let them go.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.319
Not until I confirm

17:07.353 --> 17:09.154
that you've delivered what I've requested.

17:10.455 --> 17:12.624
Well, I assume you have a lab.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.801
- [Equipment beeping]
- Ah.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.637
Dr. Scott.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.640
Ah.

17:30.843 --> 17:34.412
So nice to see you again.

17:34.447 --> 17:36.248
Do I know you?

17:36.282 --> 17:39.751
European Congress of Virology, 2011.

17:39.785 --> 17:43.355
Uh, you spoke on techniques
for hemagglutination-inhibition

17:43.389 --> 17:45.590
with arthropod-borne viruses.

17:45.625 --> 17:49.261
And afterwards, I introduced
myself, shook hands.

Niels Sorensen.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.832
I'm sorry. I don't recall.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.201
I was with Professor Lindblom.

17:56.235 --> 17:57.836
I remember Jonas.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.671
You were in his department?

17:59.705 --> 18:01.973
Um... for a time.

18:02.008 --> 18:05.477
Uh, he... never really saw clearly

18:05.511 --> 18:09.948
what I was trying to, uh...

18:09.982 --> 18:13.084
Anyways...

18:13.152 --> 18:15.086
I'd invite you in, but it's such a mess.

18:15.154 --> 18:17.155
[Laughs]

18:17.189 --> 18:20.759
Uh, actually, they are, uh,
supposed to clean up every day.

18:20.826 --> 18:24.529
And I tell them that the
U.V. light kills the virus,

18:24.563 --> 18:28.033
but, um... [Laughs]

18:28.067 --> 18:30.368
You're infected.

18:30.403 --> 18:31.970
Uh, not exactly.

18:32.004 --> 18:33.305
But you're not even symptomatic.

18:33.339 --> 18:34.706
Um...

18:34.740 --> 18:36.408
Perhaps I should explain.

18:36.442 --> 18:37.842
It was you.

18:37.877 --> 18:40.779
- You added the human gene.
- Yes.

18:42.081 --> 18:43.782
You weaponized the virus!

18:43.849 --> 18:45.317
What? No.

18:45.351 --> 18:46.651
No, I didn't weaponize it.

18:46.686 --> 18:50.322
I was really close to a major breakthrough.

18:50.356 --> 18:52.691
I added my gene to the virus

18:52.725 --> 18:54.859
and then injected it
back into my bloodstream,

18:54.894 --> 18:56.528
and it worked.

18:56.562 --> 18:59.798
I am completely immune. I just...

18:59.832 --> 19:03.134
Uh, I didn't know that I
also made myself a carrier.

19:03.169 --> 19:05.236
So you're patient zero?

19:05.271 --> 19:06.638
No, I didn't start it.

19:06.706 --> 19:08.840
I'm trying to find a solution here.

19:08.908 --> 19:10.709
I'm trying to fix it, and I can fix it

19:10.743 --> 19:12.777
as soon as I get the primordial strain.

19:12.812 --> 19:14.946
- If that...
- You don't understand what you've done.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.549
The primordial won't work now.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.384
The virus that you created,

19:19.418 --> 19:22.887
the modifications you made...
You've made it so much worse.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.890
And you could have come
forward at any point.

19:25.925 --> 19:27.559
I mean, you must have known this.

19:27.593 --> 19:29.361
No, that was too late.

19:29.395 --> 19:31.029
There was zero benefit from me
coming forward at that point...

19:31.063 --> 19:32.864
You killed four billion people.

19:32.898 --> 19:34.699
- I didn't...
- And you never gave them a chance

19:34.734 --> 19:36.901
- to understand how it happened?
- But I can now.

19:36.936 --> 19:39.504
- I mean, can solve it now.
- It's too late.

19:39.538 --> 19:41.106
I've already done it.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.707
[Scoffs]

19:42.742 --> 19:44.075

- See for yourself.

19:46.479 --> 19:49.347
Hey, that... no. You're not
allowed to do that, actually.

19:49.382 --> 19:50.414
That's mine!

19:50.439 --> 19:51.950
I would like to speak
with the admiral, please.

19:51.951 --> 19:53.918
No! She doesn't go anywhere! Unh!

19:53.953 --> 19:55.587
You don't get to do it without me.

19:55.621 --> 19:57.389
Did you really think

19:57.423 --> 19:59.457
that your D.N.A. could save the Human race?

You're a married man, for Pete's sake.

20:22.615 --> 20:24.616
And you're Navy. Did you not get the talk?

I have an idea.

20:45.404 --> 20:47.305
First we gotta get by this guy.

20:47.339 --> 20:49.474
And there's two guards on the P-Way.

20:49.508 --> 20:51.676
Goddamn it. He had to send her.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.511
Right? I mean, I'm standing right there.

20:53.546 --> 20:55.013

You lied to me!

21:15.448 --> 21:17.316
I took you in because you told me

21:17.350 --> 21:19.752
she was not capable of
succeeding without you.

Now I find you've wasted
my time and resources.

myself in here for nothing?

I'm telling you, Admiral,
her vaccine won't work.
