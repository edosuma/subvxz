20:08.659 --> 20:10.428
Yikes!

20:11.253 --> 20:14.088
Ahh! This is really... fun.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.560
I just wish I knew
where I was going.

20:19.121 --> 20:23.154
Ryder, I’m over the mountain,
\h\hbut I don’t see Rocky yet.

20:23.154 --> 20:25.659
\hRemember, he’s sliding
on the funhouse mirror.

20:25.659 --> 20:29.154
\h\hIf Rocky can reflect
some sun off the mirror,

20:29.154 --> 20:31.989
\hwe can figure out
exactly where he is.

20:31.989 --> 20:35.055
Rocky, can you flash some
sunlight off your mirror,

20:35.055 --> 20:35.758
like a signal?

20:35.758 --> 20:39.395
I’ll try it, but I have
to flip it around first.

20:40.187 --> 20:42.319
(Barking)
\h\hClaw!

20:48.022 --> 20:50.253
\h\h\h\h\h(Chuckling)
That was kind of fun!

20:50.253 --> 20:53.319
Now, to catch some rays!

20:53.593 --> 20:56.725
Skye, look for my signal!

20:59.187 --> 21:04.121
Rocky, I see it, and I’m
\hcoming to pick you up.

21:04.121 --> 21:06.187
(Barking)
\h\hHook!

21:08.593 --> 21:11.527
I’m right here, Skye.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.055
Boy, that was some ride.

21:16.055 --> 21:19.055
Ryder, I’ve got Rocky.

21:19.055 --> 21:22.395
\h\h\h\hGreat work.
Now, to save Danny.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.461
(Gasping)

21:27.461 --> 21:30.593
That looks too deep,
\h\h\h\heven for me!

21:30.593 --> 21:32.725
(Horn honking)

21:34.187 --> 21:37.253
Rubble, help!
I’m over here!

21:37.253 --> 21:39.692
Hold on! I see you!

21:39.692 --> 21:41.253
Whoa!

21:41.253 --> 21:43.022
(Cackling)

21:43.022 --> 21:44.395
(Yelping)

21:44.395 --> 21:46.154
(Groaning)

21:46.154 --> 21:48.253
Not on my watch.

21:48.253 --> 21:49.791
That was close.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.593
Extremely close. Thanks.

21:51.593 --> 21:57.121
No problem. Now, let’s get the
\h\hstuff back to the carnival.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.626
Did you see how I looked
in that funhouse mirror?

22:04.626 --> 22:07.088
My legs looked so wobbly.

22:07.088 --> 22:07.791
I sure did.

22:07.791 --> 22:11.659
That big clown in the box
\h\hmade me jump so high.

22:11.659 --> 22:12.692
(Chuckling)

22:12.692 --> 22:13.758
Hey! Thanks.

22:13.758 --> 22:14.824
Oh, thank you.

22:14.824 --> 22:16.461
We wouldn’t have
had the carnival

22:16.461 --> 22:17.593
without the PAW Patrol.

22:17.593 --> 22:20.692
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou’re welcome.
Whenever your train gets stuck,

22:20.692 --> 22:23.154
just yelp for help.

22:23.725 --> 22:26.319
\hHave you guys been
inside the funhouse?

22:26.319 --> 22:27.824
It’s really fun.

22:27.824 --> 22:28.857
That’s okay, Ryder.

22:28.857 --> 22:32.121
\h\h\h\h\hI think we’ve had
enough scary fun for today.

22:32.121 --> 22:34.352
Yeah, and bananas.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.352
(Stomach grumbling)

22:35.352 --> 22:38.626
