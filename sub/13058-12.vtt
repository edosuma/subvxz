Hey.
Suddenly, it's a party.

Post just outside the door,
please.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.538
Joe...

19:33.540 --> 19:36.474
you, uh --
You look better than expected.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.443
I think it's because
I only have one surgery to go.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.980
And because of the pain,
I'm still heavily medicated.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.151
Oh, now, the morphine is so
you can eat the hospital food.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.621
Ah, that's my cue
to exit.

Maybe I could come back
and say goodbye

all right?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.797
So, Joe...

19:59.799 --> 20:03.434
do you have the strength to talk
to me a bit about Dwight?

20:03.436 --> 20:05.536
Lately, I can think
of nothing else.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.405
We listened to all the tapes

20:07.407 --> 20:09.407
of the sessions
you had with him,

20:09.409 --> 20:11.909
in particular those parts

20:11.911 --> 20:15.413
where he spoke about his father
and Jordan Graff.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.582
Yes, I...

20:17.584 --> 20:20.151
I didn't consider it was
pertinent to his overall sanity,

20:20.153 --> 20:23.120
but Dwight started out by
telling me his father was dead,

20:23.122 --> 20:24.388
and by the third session,

20:24.390 --> 20:26.457
he was insisting
his father was a king.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.726
Which is it?
Well, Dwight was no prince,

20:28.728 --> 20:31.562
so, real or not,
his dad isn't a king.

20:31.564 --> 20:36.267
But...fantasizing about
an unknown parent's identity

20:36.269 --> 20:37.735
didn't make him insane.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.805
There was a deputy
with Dwight

20:40.807 --> 20:42.506
in every one
of your sessions?

20:42.508 --> 20:45.476
Simms asked
if I wanted him to stay.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.011
Dwight said he didn't mind.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.580
Did Dwight ever mention
his father to anyone else?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.048
I mean, other than you

20:51.050 --> 20:54.085
and, because he was in the room,
Deputy Simms?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.453
I doubt it.

20:55.455 --> 20:59.056
Is his imaginary father
important for some reason?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.625
Well, we're still trying

who's behind this conspiracy,

21:03.162 --> 21:06.397
why you were shot first,
and then Deputy Simms,

21:06.399 --> 21:09.533
who, by the way,
looks like he...

21:09.535 --> 21:11.636
he may have
aided and abetted.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.338
Aided and abetted?
In his own murder?

21:14.340 --> 21:16.941

21:16.943 --> 21:19.010
Lieutenant,
did I miss something?

Not Andy.

21:35.128 --> 21:39.664
To Andy, Dwight is just
someone he calls a dirtbag.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.565
He doesn't think about life
the same way.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.833
You may have never
killed anyone,

21:44.671 --> 21:46.771
to be tried
for the death penalty before.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.407
But I didn't have
to pass judgment,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.742

that they'd find contrition,

21:51.744 --> 21:53.778

I know how to seek.

Perhaps contrition will be
found once you obtain justice.

there's gross for everyone else.
