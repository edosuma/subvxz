00:08.443 --> 00:10.445
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:10.488 --> 00:11.576
It's waterproof.

00:11.620 --> 00:14.014
So it's safe
from my tears of joy.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.277
What's wrong?
Am... am I embarrassing you?

00:16.320 --> 00:18.018
At least
take the flowers.
No!

00:18.061 --> 00:19.280
If you won't accept
this simple gift,

00:19.323 --> 00:20.455
then what does that say
about our future?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.673
We have no future.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.719
Tommy Harte?
Amy?

00:23.762 --> 00:26.156
I don't know if
you're seeing anyone these days,

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
but I could really use
some cheering up.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.073
I was... seeing someone.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.902
But, uh, she recently
broke up with me.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.599
KARL:
Love is always a risk.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.385
The chance for love doesn't
come around every day.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.083
Are you free Friday?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.476
Yes, lover.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.043
"Ma'am" will be fine.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.609
ELI: Now that
Jade's gonna live with us,

00:44.653 --> 00:45.871
we gotta have some way
to introduce her.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.612
Well, why don't we just say
she's family?

00:47.656 --> 00:49.223
I love that.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.615
Jade, what's going on?

00:50.659 --> 00:52.748
Duke is gonna kill Teacup.Teacup?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.663
Our dog. He says
if I don't meet with him,

00:54.706 --> 00:56.099
he's gonna put her down.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.666
For the last two years,

00:57.709 --> 01:00.234
I've been pathetic Eli who...
who can't finish a screenplay,

01:00.277 --> 01:01.713
who can't help
pay the bills.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.063
I just need a fucking win.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.368
I just want to feel like a man

01:04.412 --> 01:05.500
and save a dog

01:05.543 --> 01:07.458
and have that be good enough.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.546
Jade!

01:11.593 --> 01:13.464
BETH ANN:
April is very sweet.

01:13.508 --> 01:14.900
She's so free-spirited.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.728
You wouldn't believe
the fun we have together.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.599
Try one.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.601
You know,
marijuana?

01:19.644 --> 01:20.950
I don't think it's working.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.387
ROB:
You're acting like

01:23.431 --> 01:24.432
you're drunk.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.911
That might be the pot.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.262
Pot?
It's marijuana.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.828
We will talk
about this later.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.265
I want to be a singer.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.962
Really?

01:33.005 --> 01:34.529
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.958
Um, what'd you
think, Mr. Porter?

04:23.001 --> 04:24.960
Not bad, kid.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.266
Not bad.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.485
Really? So I got the job?

04:28.529 --> 04:30.313
PORTER:
It's just one night, but...

04:30.357 --> 04:33.011
if it goes well, we could talk
about something more permanent.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.665
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.101
PORTER:
I'll see you Tuesday.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.887
Did you hear that?

04:38.930 --> 04:41.324
Oh, April,
your first singing gig.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.499
Promise me you'll come.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.500
Tuesday night?Mm-hmm.

04:43.544 --> 04:44.545
I wouldn't miss it.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.850
Wonderful.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
And you'll finally
get to meet Rob.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.333
What?

04:50.377 --> 04:51.856
I told him that
there was a chance

04:51.900 --> 04:53.336
that I could be
booking this gig,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.295
and he already agreed to come.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.036
Oh.I'll put you two at
a table together.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.170
That way you can get
to know each other.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.390
Can't wait.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.916
You'll have to help me
find something to wear.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.179
I'm thinking
maybe that blue dress

05:10.222 --> 05:13.051
with the sequins.Oh, yes, that's nice.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.750
Is something wrong?

05:15.793 --> 05:17.969
Actually, I just remembered,

05:18.013 --> 05:21.103
my aunt Lydia is getting
an operation Tuesday.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.714
An operation?Mm, to...

05:23.758 --> 05:25.847
fix her bunion.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.675
I agreed to bring her
home from the hospital

05:27.718 --> 05:29.590
and look after her.
All night.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.200
Well, can you get someone else
to look after her?

05:31.243 --> 05:32.419
You can't miss my show.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.724
I already promised.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.248
And it's... such a big bunion.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.949
This is about Rob, isn't it?

05:40.992 --> 05:42.472
What?

05:42.516 --> 05:44.387
Just admit it.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.084
You don't want to meet him

05:46.128 --> 05:49.000
because you don't approve
of Rob and I's relationship.

05:52.482 --> 05:56.181
Believe me, that
is not the reason.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.284
I'm telling you,
we're lost.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.938
Well, maybe if you'd asked
for directions

06:13.982 --> 06:15.766
when we got off the highway...

06:15.810 --> 06:18.900
Maybe if you'd picked a motel
closer than 30 miles away...

06:18.943 --> 06:20.684
Oh, I think we go left here?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.430
Oh, we're going in circles.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.867
This is the third time
we've passed that wino.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.435
Well, it's too dark
to read the signs.

06:32.479 --> 06:36.308
Oh, stop and I'll ask
at the liquor store.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.281
We're on Pike Street.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.022
Show me the map.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.561
Move along, kid.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.389
Sorry, we were just leaving.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.173
Not you, sweet cheeks.
You're busted.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.480
Busted? For what?Soliciting.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.482
You think I'm a hooker?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.745
For God's sake,
I'm wearing Yves Saint Laurent.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.225
I didn't say
you weren't successful.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.400
TOMMY: Uh,
she's with me, sir.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.793
She was just asking directions

07:25.836 --> 07:26.924
because we got lost.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.317
Relax, kid.
I'm doing you a favor.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.058
You don't want your first time
to be with a pro.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.276
How dare you?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.061
I'm a well-known philanthropist.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.323
I don't need to know
your specialty.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.411
Let's go.What?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.673
Uh...OFFICER:
Come on.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.719
Hey! Seriously, sir,
she's my girlfriend.

07:38.762 --> 07:39.981
I find that hard to believe.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.548
Well, show him your license.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.897
My... Oh, uh...

07:42.940 --> 07:44.768
Uh...

07:46.553 --> 07:49.251
If we just met, how do I
know his name is Tommy Harte

07:49.294 --> 07:50.382
and that he lives in Pasadena

07:50.426 --> 07:52.602
at 74 Oakhurst Drive?

07:52.646 --> 07:54.299
His birthday is March 10.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.867
Okay.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.130
So, if you're a couple
from Pasadena,

07:59.174 --> 08:01.132
why are you going
to a motel in Azusa?

08:02.525 --> 08:04.179
We are having an illicit affair.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.050
We've driven 30 miles
to avoid being spotted

08:06.094 --> 08:07.704
by his mother,
who is my best friend,

08:07.748 --> 08:10.228
and my husband, who is gay.

08:14.276 --> 08:17.279
Well, I got to give you points
for creativity.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.674
Have fun, kid.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.076
Eli! Hey, can you
walk Teacup for me?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.817
I'm helping Taylor
pack for her trip.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.166
Yeah, sure.Thanks.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.777
Still going to Fresno, huh?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.780
I have to. This conference has
been on the books for months.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.608
Honey, the people at your firm
know that we were attacked.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.045
I mean, they wouldn't blink
if you opted out.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.613
I know, but I told my sisters
I'm coming to town,

08:46.656 --> 08:48.658
and they're still threatening
to visit this summer,

08:48.702 --> 08:50.704
so we kind of want
to break the news

08:50.747 --> 08:52.967
about our living situation
before that happens.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.099
Why don't you
just shoot them a text?

08:55.143 --> 08:57.667
I'm not gonna tell my sisters
I'm in a throuple via text.Yeah.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.495
Just make sure you tell them
it was your idea, not mine.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.192
But it wasyour idea.ELI:
Yeah,

09:01.236 --> 09:02.803
but your sisters
hate me enough as it is.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.674
We don't need to throw
any more gas on that fire.

09:06.589 --> 09:10.027
You haven't met them yet,
but they're awful.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.595
All right, Teacup.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.075
Whoa, here we go.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.643
Yeah.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.821
Lamar.
Oh!

09:20.864 --> 09:22.562
You doknow who I am.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.128
I was curious

09:24.172 --> 09:25.608
'cause you've been avoiding me
for weeks.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.305
No, no, no. No, I...

09:27.349 --> 09:29.525
I-I was absolutely
gonna call you back, man.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.527
I just...
I've been incredibly busy.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
I see you had time to get a dog.

09:33.616 --> 09:34.791
Oh, forgot to tell you.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.097
You'll like this.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.055
Finally had that threesome.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.623
I would ask what one has to do
with the other,

09:40.667 --> 09:41.929
but never the fuck mind.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.322
Where is my script?Script?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.586
The one you promised
would be done a month ago?

09:46.629 --> 09:48.239
The one I talked up
to Paramount.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.067
Got 'em all excited,
and now they're pissed off

09:50.111 --> 09:51.591
wondering what happened to it.

09:51.634 --> 09:52.940
Well, it-it's almost done.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.290
I'm just... making
a few final tweaks.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.900
Oh, please.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.424
The only line older than that
is "let there be light."

09:59.468 --> 10:01.557
No, I'm not lying.
Look, I-I swear to you--

10:01.601 --> 10:03.472
I swear to you, I will have it
to you in one week.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.083
No. You got 24 hours.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.477
Starting now.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.653
Come on, man, we're
supposed to be friends.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.350
Look, I am your friend.
Any other agent would have

10:12.394 --> 10:14.048
kicked your ass
to the curb long ago.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.223
Okay, well, yeah, and of course,

10:15.266 --> 10:16.659
I'm grateful
that you stood by me,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.705
but please, I mean--
Give me till Friday.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.663
You got till 10:15 tomorrow.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.578
Tweak fast.

10:23.884 --> 10:27.191
Are you having an affair?

10:27.235 --> 10:29.541
Really, Karl, before breakfast?

10:29.585 --> 10:31.239
No, I heard you on
the phone this morning.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.415
You were arguing
with someone,

10:33.458 --> 10:36.984
refusing to meet unless they
found a discreet location.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.595
You listened to
a private conversation?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.771
You should be ashamed
of yourself.
Well, I am...

10:41.815 --> 10:44.252
after I've had sex
with a busboy in an alleyway,

10:44.295 --> 10:47.037
but I-I don't really break
a sweat over eavesdropping.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
Regardless, I don't owe you
any explanations,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.562
so drop the subject.Oh, go on.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.999
Tell me who it is.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.088
Is it one of our friends
from the country club?

10:54.131 --> 10:56.917
The tennis instruct--
No, the chef.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.659
Karl, I believe you're jealous.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.225
Oh, don't be daft.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.749
Oh, by the way,

11:02.792 --> 11:05.229
if it is a busboy
named Julio,

11:05.273 --> 11:07.405
will you give him
my regards?

11:07.449 --> 11:10.452
Mm, the irony is just delicious.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.193
Is it one of our neighbors?

11:12.236 --> 11:14.586
Dig all you like, Karl.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.110
Even if I were
having an affair,

11:16.153 --> 11:18.939
you'd never hear
his name from me.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.551
We need to talk
about Tommy.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.121
The bed news is
he's been acting strangely.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.732
He leaves the house
at all hours of the night.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.865
Won't tell me where he's been
when he comes home.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.433
Oh, I do home Tommy hasn't
fallen in with the wrong crowd.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.087
Why are you looking at me?

11:37.131 --> 11:39.394
I'm offering you a cookie.Oh.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.265
Right.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.355
The good news is
I got him a new job

11:44.399 --> 11:46.053
working for Bader's Nursery.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.663
He'll be doing home care.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.447
Home care?That means he'll go

11:49.491 --> 11:51.275
into people's houses
and water their plants

11:51.319 --> 11:52.276
while they're at work

11:52.320 --> 11:53.800
or on vacation.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.018
Will he?

11:55.062 --> 11:56.628
This is where
the favor comes in.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.370
I'm asking all of my friends
to hire Tommy.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.329
I need to keep him busy.

12:01.372 --> 12:04.071
Just so I'm clear,
people leave town

12:04.114 --> 12:05.768
and give Tommy
the keys to their homes?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.728
I know what you're thinking,
but Tommy is

12:08.771 --> 12:11.382
very trustworthy...
and quick, too.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.558
He'd be in and out.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.431
I'm sure he'd stay long enough
to get the job done.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.476
Of course.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.565
Can I count you in?

12:20.609 --> 12:21.741
Oh, why not?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.003
We like Tommy,
don't we, darling?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.613
Oh, yes.

12:24.656 --> 12:27.050
We certainly do.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.269
BETH ANN:
Poor April.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.053
If you could
have seen her face.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.881
Oh, you don't want me
anywhere near that tramp's face

12:31.925 --> 12:33.753
because I will slap it.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.102
It's her big night.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.886
I was honored she wanted me
to come so badly.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.801
Doesn't she have
any other friends?

12:38.845 --> 12:41.412
Or did she sleep
with their husbands, too?

12:41.456 --> 12:42.718
I'm glad Rob is going.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.764
She needs someone there
to cheer her on.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.113
I don't get it.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.549
This is war.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.290
You are fighting
with another woman

12:49.333 --> 12:51.814
over your husband
and you are losing.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.729
ROB:
Honey!

12:53.773 --> 12:56.123
He's home early.
I'm in here, Rob.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.820
If he tells you that he's got
to work late Tuesday,

12:57.864 --> 12:59.517
I will vomit
and you will have to mop

12:59.561 --> 13:01.476
this floor up all over again.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.999
There you are.
Guess what?

13:03.043 --> 13:05.741
I have amazing news.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.829
You do?

13:06.873 --> 13:09.745
I got two tickets
to the World Series.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.833
For when?

13:10.877 --> 13:13.531
Let me guess. Tuesday?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.403
ROB:
As a matter of fact, yeah.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.448
My boss gave them to me
as a gift, and they

13:17.492 --> 13:20.408
are right behind home plate.Who are you taking?

13:20.451 --> 13:21.626
What do you mean,
who am I taking?

13:21.670 --> 13:22.845
Only my best girl.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.455
Let me see those.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.111
Holy crap!

13:28.155 --> 13:30.897
He's got two tickets
to the World Series.

13:30.940 --> 13:31.941
Isn't that what I just said?

13:31.985 --> 13:33.029
And these are for Tuesday?

13:33.073 --> 13:35.031
Yeah.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.380
ROB:
What's wrong?

13:36.424 --> 13:39.079
Well, I just want to make sure

13:39.122 --> 13:41.603
we haven't forgotten
about any plans

13:41.646 --> 13:44.214
we might have made for Tuesday?

13:44.258 --> 13:46.826
Well, whatever plans we made,
consider them canceled.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.090
I've got a date with my wife,
the Dodgers and the Yankees.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.092
Okay.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.137
What's going on here?
Why aren't you happy?

13:54.181 --> 13:57.575
Oh, she is very happy.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.187
She's just not used
to you being so wonderful.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.623
Oh.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.190
Huh?

14:03.233 --> 14:05.757
Rob, give us a second. We're not
through with the mopping.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.326
I got to call Carl.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.981
He's gonna be so
jealous.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.811
April is going
to be heartbroken.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.508
To hell with April.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.902
You've got to focus
on the big picture.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.819
He's choosing you
over her.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.908
You're winning.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.129
I guess I am.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.924
JADE:
Hey. Taylor called.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.231
Her plane landed
in Fresno.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.495
What are you doing?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.629
Killing myself.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.588
With cheese?Yeah. My plan is

14:53.631 --> 14:56.330
to get super fat
and then die of hypertension.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.593
That might take a while.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.509
Only great writers
deserve quick deaths.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.990
Hemingway, Wolfe, Plath.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.775
Me? I'm a bad writer,

15:06.818 --> 15:09.125
so I deserve
to die slowly,

15:09.169 --> 15:12.520
painfully... disgustingly.

15:14.870 --> 15:15.958
Do we have any mustard?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.699
No.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.614
But we have mayonnaise.

15:19.657 --> 15:22.312
Oh, yes, the condiment of hacks.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.793
Bring it to me.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.405
What's going on?

15:31.365 --> 15:33.323
My agent's gonna drop me

15:33.367 --> 15:35.456
if I don't get him my script
by tomorrow morning.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.415
And you're not finished?

15:38.459 --> 15:42.376
I-I've written 50 pages.
Each just worst than the last.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.073
I doubt that.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.727
I mean, I have no third act.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.207
I keep sitting here,

15:47.250 --> 15:48.643
staring at the poster
of my one and only hit,

15:48.686 --> 15:50.732
praying for some sort
of inspiration.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.213
And the longer I look at it,
the more I realize...

15:53.256 --> 15:54.823
it was a fluke.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.781
I mean, brilliant
director, stellar cast,

15:56.825 --> 15:58.827
all turning my crap dialogue
into gold.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.658
How am I gonna tell Taylor

16:03.701 --> 16:05.834
that I lost my fucking agent?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.055
Give me the 50 pages.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.970
Why, so you can
beat me with them?

16:11.013 --> 16:14.321
Because I think it might help
you to get some honest feedback.

16:14.364 --> 16:17.933
Do you know anything
about writing?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.674
I know what I like.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.850
And if I think that
your script's in decent shape,

16:21.893 --> 16:26.768
you'll have the confidence
to finish the damn thing.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.945
Yeah, and what if it's just
50 pages of me shitting the bed?

16:29.989 --> 16:33.253
Then I will go to the store
and I will buy you

16:33.296 --> 16:36.169
every kind of cheese
known to man.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.475
And mayonnaise.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.521
Gonna need lots of mayonnaise.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
Rob, what are you doing?
We're going to be late.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.049
I'm looking
for my old baseball glove.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.530
Maybe I can get Sandy Koufax
to sign it.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.533
Don't bother Mr. Koufax tonight.
He'll be working.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.143
Eh, he can sign one glove.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.667
Maybe it's in one of the boxes
in the garage.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.278
No, it should be in this one.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
Stanton residence.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.108
Hold on.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.762
Maybe you're right
about the garage.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.766
Check the box by the tool
drawer. I got to take this.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.377
Who is it?

17:10.420 --> 17:13.075
Uh, a guy from work.
Uh, I'll be right down.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.440
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.964
I said never
to call me here.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.620
I already told you,
I got plans with my wife.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.231
She's making me
take her out to dinner.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.366
Don't cry. L-Look,
I hate it when you cry.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.846
There's nothing
I can do about this.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.282
Now-now I got to go.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.732
Well, you were right
about the garage.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.343
No sign of your glove.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.779
Eh, it doesn't matter.
Let's get going

18:04.822 --> 18:06.824
or we'll miss
the national anthem.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.783
Honey, I don't think I can go.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.001
What?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.526
I'm not feeling well.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.788
You look fine to me.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.398
Robert.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.922
You remember our trip
to New Mexico?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.837
You mean, you got...

18:19.881 --> 18:23.014
Yes. I should stay close
to a bathroom.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.668
Well, they got bathrooms
at the stadium.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.715
I could never do that
to total strangers.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.979
Want me to stay
home with you?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.981
Don't be silly.

18:33.024 --> 18:36.071
: Oh, good. Thank God,
'cause I really want to go.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.072
Bye.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.427
April, it's Sheila.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.429
My aunt is fine.

18:46.473 --> 18:49.867
I can come hear you sing
after all.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.436
Yes. I'm happy, too.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.484
Ah.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.094
It is so good

18:59.138 --> 19:00.313
to see you guys.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.662
I just wish Mama
could've made it.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.880
How is she?

19:02.924 --> 19:05.144
Nasty as ever.Mean as the day is long.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.711
We work our fingers
to the bone for that woman.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.670
But it's never good
enough for her.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.759
VELMA:
The doctor says
she could live to be 100.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.762
And she'll do it,
just to spite us.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.243
Well, look, I know she can be
difficult to care for,

19:17.286 --> 19:18.983
and I wish
I could help out more.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.376
Oh, don't worry about it, sugar.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.944
We don't resent you.Not much, anyway.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.076
Would be nice if you could
take her off our hands

19:25.120 --> 19:26.513
every now and then.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.080
Got an extra room
in that big house of yours?

19:29.124 --> 19:30.473
Don't need to be fancy.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.127
Oh, it could be the
cellar for all we care.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.524
I would really like to help out,
but it would be tricky,

19:37.567 --> 19:40.004
given my current
living situation.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.919
Okay, I meant to lead
with this when I sat down,

19:41.963 --> 19:45.096
but the truth is...

19:45.140 --> 19:47.229
I am no longer in
an open marriage.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.144
You left Eli?Thank you, Jesus.

19:49.188 --> 19:54.280
No, I didn't leave Eli, I
moved my lover into our home.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.196
The three of us are
officially a throuple.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.419
Would it be okay
if we tell Mama?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.508
'Cause this will kill her.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.576
APRIL:
Sheila.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.622
Hi.Look at you.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.843
You're lovely.
Thanks.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.758
Oh, I'm so nervous.

20:37.801 --> 20:38.889
You're going to be great.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.848
Hey, kid,
you're on in ten.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.241
Oh, thank you, Mr. Porter.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.160
What are you looking for?

20:49.204 --> 20:52.120
It's silly.
Rob told me he can't make it.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.991
I just... I keep thinking
maybe he'll surprise me.

20:54.035 --> 20:56.690
Honey, you can't worry
about that right now.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.300
You've got a show to do.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.825
You're right. Thank you
so much for being here.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.392
Knock 'em dead.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.873
Okay.

Hey.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.578
Well?

22:01.407 --> 22:02.625
It's good.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.497
You hate it.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.368
No. It's good.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.978
It's not great.Some of it's great.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.241
The dialogue,
the scenes in the diner...

22:10.285 --> 22:11.852
Just-just skip to what sucks.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.898
That would be
your lead character.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.901
What's wrong with Eva?

22:17.945 --> 22:21.296
She waits around for 15 pages
hoping a man will save her.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.951
She's a victim. I hate victims.

22:26.910 --> 22:30.174
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean,
make her more proactive, sure.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.785
And can't she do
something interesting

22:31.828 --> 22:33.352
to get out of trouble?

22:33.395 --> 22:36.355
What do you mean, interesting?Like, on page 40,

22:36.398 --> 22:42.056
she's abandoned at the diner
and totally broke, right?

22:42.099 --> 22:44.058
Yeah.So, let her

22:44.101 --> 22:45.494
steal the owner's truck

22:45.538 --> 22:47.931
and then she drives
to the drug dealer's house

22:47.975 --> 22:49.672
and starts a fire.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.021
And when he runs
out the front,

22:51.065 --> 22:52.414
she goes in the back
and gets the money

22:52.458 --> 22:53.633
that he took from her.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.851
And his gun.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.853
She'd definitely take his gun.

22:56.897 --> 23:01.510
Wow. Um, I mean, i-it's
definitely more proactive.

23:01.554 --> 23:05.427
It's just... I don't know,
I-I never saw Eva that way.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.038
I mean, she's...
she's a nice girl.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.433
Yeah, but nice girls,
they break the law every day.

23:11.477 --> 23:15.176
When they need to.

23:15.219 --> 23:18.745
Okay. All right, I hear you.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.400
There's more to Eva
than meets the eye.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.314
Exactly.

23:23.358 --> 23:28.015
So now, get started, open
your laptop, get to work.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.234
You have 22 hours.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.630
Hey.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.415
How did you come up
with that stuff, anyway?

23:38.155 --> 23:41.289
Maybe there's more to me
than meets the eye.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.656
TOMMY: Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.267
It's okay.
Are you clear on what to do?

24:03.311 --> 24:04.965
I guess.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.271
Are we sure about this?
I mean, if we get caught...

24:07.315 --> 24:09.709
Yes. It's very risky.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.146
I suppose the smart thing
to do is end this affair

24:12.189 --> 24:14.278
and never have sex again.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.541
Fine.

I don't know why
Mrs. Dubner's bed feels amazing.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.818
It's the sheets.
They're Egyptian cotton.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.124
How do you know that?

25:17.167 --> 25:18.517
I used to wash
sheets like this

25:18.560 --> 25:20.257
when I worked in
my father's laundry.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.433
Your dad owned a laundry?

25:22.477 --> 25:25.306
You think I was born rich?

25:25.349 --> 25:27.308
Well... yeah.

25:27.351 --> 25:30.833
Not even close.

25:30.877 --> 25:35.969
When I was 12, I used
to covet things like this.

25:36.012 --> 25:40.451
Once, I took some
satin sheets home.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.584
I wanted to see
what it felt like

25:42.628 --> 25:44.673
to sleep on them,
just for one night.

25:44.717 --> 25:48.677
My mother caught me.
She was so angry.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.810
She made me wash
and iron them right there.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.159
It was 2:00 in the morning.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.987
And then she took them away.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.604
That's a shame.Mm.

26:05.868 --> 26:09.785
Mother said, "If you want
to sleep on expensive sheets,

26:09.829 --> 26:12.309
choose wisely
who you sleep next to."

26:12.353 --> 26:16.139
So, uh, she basically told you
to marry for money.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.185
That's, uh, some
really bad advice.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.361
Well, I followed it twice.

26:20.404 --> 26:24.626
I didn't think of marrying
for love until Karl.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.500
I never told that story before.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.592
To anyone.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.161
Thanks for telling me first.

26:38.205 --> 26:42.078
If you really want to thankme,

26:42.122 --> 26:43.079
get over here.

26:50.130 --> 26:53.612
Oh, I feel so badly about this.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.919
After you went
to all the trouble

26:56.963 --> 26:58.965
of taking me to the airport.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.314
It's fine, Joyce.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.532
Nobody expects you
to get on a plane

27:01.576 --> 27:03.491
when you're feeling ill.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.668
Oh, it's the plant van.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.453
Tommy must be here.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.375
So, finally,
I confessed to Eli

27:18.419 --> 27:20.247
how much Jade meant to me,
and he agreed

27:20.290 --> 27:23.032
to let her live
with us, permanently.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.733
Yes, I know,
it's unconventional,

27:27.776 --> 27:29.996
and you probably don't approve,

27:30.039 --> 27:34.043
but... it's working.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.524
Well, as long as
you're happy.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.091
That's what matters.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.528
Really?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.008
That's all you have to say?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.272
Since you asked,
I have a question.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.143
Here we go.Do you still love Eli?

27:47.187 --> 27:49.058
Of course.And you also love this woman?

27:49.102 --> 27:50.451
Yes.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.932
I'm wondering, how do they
feel about each other?

27:54.890 --> 27:57.806
Oh. Well...

27:57.850 --> 27:59.199
I knew she hadn't
thought it through.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.201
Hadn't even crossed
her mind.
Mm-hmm.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.593
Hold on. Eli and Jade
like each other.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.204
That's not a problem.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.554
Not yet. What happens when
he likes her more than you?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.338
What happens when she
gets tired of sharing?

28:08.382 --> 28:10.645
Where does that
leave you, missy?On the outside

28:10.689 --> 28:12.560
looking in, that's where.

28:12.603 --> 28:13.692
That's not gonna happen.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.434
It's not.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.785
Obviously, we don't know Jade.

28:19.828 --> 28:20.829
So we can't judge her.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.135
But we know Eli.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.876
We saw what he put you through.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.660
Yes, we went through
a dark time,

28:25.704 --> 28:27.140
but that was two years ago.

28:27.183 --> 28:29.751
"A dark time"?
The man's a drug addict.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.840
Half your savings
went up his nose.

28:31.884 --> 28:34.016
The man's incapable
of self-control.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.236
And now he's got
another woman in his bed?

28:36.279 --> 28:37.803
The hell did you think
was gonna happen?

28:37.846 --> 28:40.066
Stop it!

28:40.109 --> 28:41.197
I know you're trying
to bait me,

28:41.241 --> 28:42.895
but it's not gonna work.

28:42.938 --> 28:46.333
I'm telling you,
Eli has changed.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.640
Oh, baby sister,
men never change.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.773
They just get better
at keeping secrets.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.688
Mm.

29:01.914 --> 29:02.958
Hello?

29:04.003 --> 29:05.178
It's Mrs. Dubner.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.745
You said she was
going to France.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.050
Yeah, my mom took her
to the airport this morning.

29:08.094 --> 29:11.662
Tommy, where are you?

29:11.706 --> 29:14.361
Oh!You have to hide!

29:14.404 --> 29:15.797
Make the bed.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.104
I can't do both.

29:18.147 --> 29:21.063
I know you think I'm
a ridiculous hypochondriac,

29:21.107 --> 29:22.325
but the pain is real.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.500
NAOMI:
You'll be fine.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.981
You just need to
lie down in your room.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.897
Mrs. Dubner.
Did you miss your flight?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.638
I'm having a migraine.
I need to rest.

29:30.681 --> 29:34.337
No, uh...
you can't go in there.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.686
Why not?

29:35.730 --> 29:39.560
I, uh, just sprayed.

29:39.603 --> 29:40.909
Sprayed?

29:40.953 --> 29:43.912
Uh, insecticide.

29:43.956 --> 29:47.133
Your, uh, your ficus had
a white fly.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.309
I've never seen any white fly.Yeah, well, they're...

29:49.352 --> 29:51.790
they're pretty tiny...
see?

29:51.833 --> 29:53.400
Oh, my God. Kill it!

29:53.443 --> 29:55.445
See, I-I didn't know that
you would be back so soon,

29:55.489 --> 29:57.708
so I used a very
strong insecticide.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.798
You inhale those fumes
with a migraine and...

30:01.190 --> 30:03.671
You're right.
I can smell it.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.325
Yeah, y-you better stay
downstairs.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.544
Don't just stand there,
help her down.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.470
We need you to run
to the pharmacy.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.602
Now?

30:21.645 --> 30:22.995
I'm out of medication.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.866
Here's my prescription.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.913
I should go open
some windows in the bedroom.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.001
To air it out.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.567
Oh, hurry.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.047
Joyce is in agony.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.446
Joyce is sick. I have
to go to the drugstore.

30:39.489 --> 30:40.751
Well, how am I supposed
to get out of here?

30:40.795 --> 30:42.057
I don't know.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.639
Hello?Karl, it's me.
I need your help.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.728
Speak up, I can hardly hear you.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.599
I'm trapped in
Joyce Dubner's house.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.951
Oh, dear, is she telling
her appendectomy story again?

31:05.994 --> 31:07.778
She doesn't know I'm here,
and neither does Naomi.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.259
Sorry, Naomi's there?

31:10.303 --> 31:12.174
Yes, and I'm trapped upstairs.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.830
Upstairs?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.701
Would this have anything to do
with the affair

31:17.745 --> 31:19.529
you're not having?

31:19.573 --> 31:21.096
Now is not the time!

31:21.140 --> 31:23.620
Oh, what a nasty tone.
I think I'm gonna hang up.

31:23.664 --> 31:24.839
All right, all right,
fine, fine.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.058
I'm having an affair.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.755
Now can you please
come over here

31:27.798 --> 31:29.800
and create a distraction
so I can get out?

31:32.020 --> 31:33.804
What are husbands for?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.114
Eli?

31:40.681 --> 31:42.074
Hey, Eli.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.077
Eli, hey.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.035
Hmm?You fell asleep.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.820
Oh, my God, what time is it?It's 4:00 in the morning.

31:49.864 --> 31:53.085
What? Oh, shit.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.043
How much have you done?61 pages.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.784
The good news is that
I think the story's working,

31:56.827 --> 31:58.177
but, I mean, I don't know,
I can't tell,

31:58.220 --> 32:00.266
'cause I'm just so tired
I can't even think.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.745
Well, you have to keep going.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.617
Lamar expects
the script by breakfast.I know, I know.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.271
I've been writing
for ten hours straight.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.968
Believe me when I tell you
that there is no tank left

32:07.012 --> 32:08.839
in the gas.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.930
Wait. No, that's right.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.933
Hold on, I have something.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.153
Ah.

32:18.197 --> 32:19.763
Here we go.

32:19.807 --> 32:22.331
Take this.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.942
What is that?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.900
I get pills to help
with my ADHD.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.424
They give you a lift
and they help you focus.

32:28.468 --> 32:31.819
Uh... I don't think I should.

32:31.862 --> 32:33.255
It's fine.
It's not a big deal.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.909
Like, college kids
take them all the time

32:34.953 --> 32:36.345
to cram for midterms and shit.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.872
Yeah... No, thank you.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.527
Okay, it's your choice.

32:46.573 --> 32:49.315
Fuck it, give me the pill.Are you sure?

32:49.358 --> 32:52.405
Yes, yes. I need
to finish the script.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.431
Eli. What are you doing here?

33:18.474 --> 33:20.172
Hand-delivering you my script.

33:20.215 --> 33:21.521
You couldn't send it by e-mail?

33:21.564 --> 33:23.131
No, no, no, I could not,
because I needed

33:23.175 --> 33:25.612
to look you in the eye
when I told you

33:25.655 --> 33:26.656
that it's not done.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.007
Oh, come on...But, but,

33:29.050 --> 33:31.270
I finished 80 pages,
and it's great.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.272
So great that
you're gonna call me,

33:33.315 --> 33:34.925
and you're going to apologize
for ever considering

33:34.969 --> 33:36.318
dropping me as a client.

33:36.362 --> 33:37.754
You're gonna say, "Eli,
this is fucking brilliant.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.321
"I can't fucking wait
to see how it ends.

33:39.365 --> 33:42.150
You, my friend, are one fucking
talented motherfucker."

33:45.110 --> 33:48.461
Hey, sweetie.

33:48.504 --> 33:49.940
I didn't see you there.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.292
I'm shutting the door now.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.381
As well you should.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.824
I found your sleep mask.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.479
Bring it here.
There's too much light.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.467
What the hell was that?!

34:41.340 --> 34:45.474
Somebody just rammed
into my car.

34:55.658 --> 34:56.964
Karl?

34:59.923 --> 35:01.621
What have you done?I'm so sorry.

35:01.664 --> 35:02.752
I-I swerved

35:02.796 --> 35:05.929
to avoid a kitten.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.583
Isn't this Joyce Dubner's house?

35:07.627 --> 35:09.237
Yes.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.370
So, where-where's Joyce?

35:12.936 --> 35:15.461
Naomi?
You're back quickly.

35:15.504 --> 35:16.810
What happened out there?

35:18.203 --> 35:19.682
Naomi?

35:21.771 --> 35:23.904
Oh, you must be inhaling fumes.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.384
You better get some water.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.978
Hey...

35:55.022 --> 35:56.676
What happened here?

35:56.719 --> 36:00.288
I just brought Joyce home
from the airport.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.683
She's ill, and your husband
just crashed into my car.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.119
KARL: Yes,
and I was out for a drive

36:05.163 --> 36:07.208
and had to swerve
to avoid hitting a puppy.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.470
I thought it was a kitten.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.080
Well, it had fur
and moved quickly.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.343
Anyway, crash.

36:11.386 --> 36:14.215
Oh, good, Tommy's back.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.477
Back?

36:15.521 --> 36:17.218
Well, he was here
spraying the plants

36:17.262 --> 36:18.698
in Joyce's bedroom,

36:18.741 --> 36:21.614
and I sent him to the drugstore
for her pills.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.659
Well, wasn't that lucky, dear?

36:23.703 --> 36:26.096
Seems Tommy was
right there in the bedroom

36:26.140 --> 36:28.055
ready to be useful.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.449
Well, I'll see you
at home, Karl.

36:30.492 --> 36:31.841
I have to finish
my jog.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.191
Do you, darling?

36:33.234 --> 36:35.236
'Cause I'm pretty sure
the jog is up.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.681
I can't understand
why you're not happy.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.509
Tonight was a triumph.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.076
You should be dancing
in the street.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.252
Yeah. I know.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.429
Guess I just really hoped
Rob would show up.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.301
Sweetie, it's going to be okay.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.390
No, it's not.

36:58.433 --> 37:01.915
It's not going to be okay
ever again.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.743
Well, why not?

37:03.786 --> 37:06.180
Because I'm falling
in love with him.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.667
JADE:
Eli?

37:16.451 --> 37:18.192
What's going on?

37:18.236 --> 37:21.108
Hey.
Hey.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.330
I just got a call from Lamar.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.854
Okay. What did he say?

37:27.897 --> 37:31.727
He said it's the best thing
I've ever written.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.643
Really?Yeah. He said it's smart

37:34.687 --> 37:37.516
and exciting
and that the character of Eva

37:37.559 --> 37:40.823
is "deliciously complex."

37:42.521 --> 37:45.088
And then he told me to not
fuck up the ending, but, I mean,

37:45.132 --> 37:47.874
the point is, he loved it.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.137
I'm so happy for you.Oh, my God.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.052
How do I even begin
to say thank you?

37:52.095 --> 37:53.488
I didn't do much.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.316
Yes, you did.
You know you did.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.187
And if I was actually good
at what I do,

37:57.231 --> 37:58.972
I would come up with something
better than just "thank you,"

37:59.015 --> 38:00.495
but for now,

38:00.539 --> 38:02.280
that's all I got,
so thank you.

38:02.323 --> 38:05.239
No, look, I'll take it,
I'll take it. Oh.Thank you, thank you.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.980
Congrats.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.385
Oh, uh...

38:20.428 --> 38:22.952
A-Are we allowed to do this
without Taylor?

38:22.996 --> 38:26.608
I'm not...
not sure.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.144
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

38:41.188 --> 38:44.278
I would never say that.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.237
Now this
was not the plan.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.370
I was not supposed
to care this much.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.286
When he didn't
show up tonight,

38:52.330 --> 38:55.333
it just... hit me.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.901
What am I gonna do now?

38:58.945 --> 39:02.035
I have a hunch
he's happier at home

39:02.078 --> 39:04.646
than he's led you to believe.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.606
Which means he'll continue
to disappoint you.

39:07.649 --> 39:11.566
You don't need that
right now.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.569
Your career is finally
taking off.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.571
You should be
enjoying this time,

39:16.615 --> 39:19.661
not mooning over some
other woman's husband.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.968
I mean, why would he
even be with me

39:22.011 --> 39:23.839
if he was so happy with her?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.456
Maybe she did something
to hurt him

39:31.499 --> 39:33.588
and he needs time
to forgive her.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.069
I don't really understand that.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.117
It's late.
I should go.

39:41.161 --> 39:44.425
And you should
get some sleep.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.601
Sheila.

39:48.211 --> 39:51.084
You are such a good friend.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.175
I think you're maybe
the best I've ever had.

39:55.218 --> 39:59.484
You really were
wonderful tonight.

40:26.902 --> 40:27.860
Um...

40:27.903 --> 40:29.209
I need to use your bathroom.

40:29.252 --> 40:30.645
Oh, uh, it's a mess.

40:30.689 --> 40:31.820
Can I just clean up first?

40:31.864 --> 40:34.214
No!

40:34.257 --> 40:35.998
Is everything okay?

40:37.565 --> 40:40.742
Um, I...
I may be in here a while.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.748
Oh...

40:49.011 --> 40:50.622
Hey, baby.

40:50.665 --> 40:53.581
Rob. Hi-- What are you,
what are you doing here?

40:53.625 --> 40:55.888
I wanted to come hear
about your show.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.803
APRIL: Oh,
it went great.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.718
Oh, good.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.502
Mm, we should celebrate.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.899
Oh, I can't. My friend is here.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.901
I don't see anybody.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.425
She's in the bathroom.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.518
What's wrong
with her?

41:17.562 --> 41:21.217
I think she
has diarrhea.

41:21.261 --> 41:23.437
Lot of that
going around.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.268
Come here.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.183
Can we talk tomorrow?

41:30.226 --> 41:32.228
I'm here now.

41:32.272 --> 41:35.841
Now is not a good time.Mm.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.147
And I have something
important to tell you.

41:38.191 --> 41:41.107
Don't tell him. Not now.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.326
What is it?

41:43.370 --> 41:46.634
No. You're drunk.I had two beers.

41:46.678 --> 41:50.769
Come on, give me,
give me a hint.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.771
APRIL:
Well...

41:52.814 --> 41:56.992
I have been doing
a lot of thinking about us,

41:57.036 --> 41:59.647
and I realized something.

41:59.691 --> 42:00.909
Are you breaking up
with me?

42:00.953 --> 42:02.781
God, no.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.783
ROB:  Okay.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.263
I'm in love with you.

42:10.353 --> 42:12.573
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:12.617 --> 42:15.576
I just... I just thought
it would be nice to know

42:15.620 --> 42:17.186
how you felt
about me.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.364
I'm not leaving my wife.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.802
Yeah, no, I'm not asking you to.

42:23.845 --> 42:24.977
See, I think you are.

42:26.805 --> 42:31.461
I think you're too drunk
to have this conversation.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.854
When you start using
the "L word,"

42:32.898 --> 42:34.595
a guy can sober up pretty quick.

42:34.639 --> 42:36.641
You don't love me?

42:36.684 --> 42:38.077
I think you're great.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.862
You think I'm great?

42:40.906 --> 42:42.516
That's your response?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.953
You knew the rules.
I was very clear.

42:44.997 --> 42:47.434
I will never leave my wife!

42:47.477 --> 42:49.654
APRIL: Please don't yell at me.ROB: Well, you're
making me angry!

42:49.697 --> 42:51.699
Okay, okay, okay.

42:51.743 --> 42:54.049
I-I...

42:57.052 --> 43:01.448
So...

43:01.491 --> 43:04.059
where does that leave me?

43:04.103 --> 43:05.539
I don't know.

43:06.888 --> 43:09.891
I think that
you should go.

43:38.224 --> 43:39.791
You okay?

43:39.834 --> 43:43.664
Yeah, he usually doesn't speak
to me that way.

43:43.708 --> 43:46.667
He's normally very kind.

43:46.711 --> 43:49.627
Oh, honey.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.898
Well, I hope his wife
appreciates how lucky she is.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.512
I'm not sure she's that lucky.

44:09.559 --> 44:10.909
KARL:
So...

44:10.952 --> 44:12.737
Tommy Harte.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.956
I know he's a bit young...

44:15.000 --> 44:18.090
A bit? When I met him,
he was eight.

44:18.133 --> 44:19.918
And you were heterosexual.

44:19.961 --> 44:22.964
And now this child
is your lover?

44:23.008 --> 44:24.705
Who knew there was
such a fine line

44:24.749 --> 44:26.707
between adultery
and day care?

44:26.751 --> 44:29.144
Bugger off, Karl.
You have no right to judge me.

44:29.188 --> 44:30.842
I'm not judging you,

44:30.885 --> 44:32.408
I'm just teasing.

44:32.452 --> 44:35.194
If anything,
I'm happy for us. Drink?

44:35.237 --> 44:38.240
Brandy. What do you mean
you're happy for us?

44:38.284 --> 44:42.592
Well, don't you see?
We don't need to get a divorce.

44:42.636 --> 44:46.292
We have stumbled into
the perfect arrangement.

44:46.335 --> 44:48.381
You will have your lovers
and I will have mine,

44:48.424 --> 44:51.732
and then we will come home
to sparkling conversation.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.647
It's very European.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.955
It doesn't bother you that I'm
having sex with someone else?

44:56.998 --> 44:58.870
Darling, I'm gay.

44:58.913 --> 45:02.874
Look, for me, sex with a woman
is like emptying the dishwasher.

45:02.917 --> 45:04.614
I mean, I'll do it if I'm asked,

45:04.658 --> 45:06.791
but if someone else volunteers,
I won't complain.

45:10.751 --> 45:13.928
Oh. You know I love this shirt.

45:13.972 --> 45:16.496
You might've asked for vodka.

45:16.539 --> 45:18.933
I don't understand.
How can you not be jealous?

45:18.977 --> 45:22.371
Sorry, wait, you want me
to be jealous of Tommy Harte?

45:22.415 --> 45:24.896
He's jealous of you!

45:24.939 --> 45:26.854
So he should be.
I'm the husband.

45:26.898 --> 45:28.682
Not for long.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.771
Oh, what are you gonna do,
divorce me and marry Tommy?

45:30.815 --> 45:32.947
Maybe I will.Oh, good. Well,
I'll get you a gift.

45:32.991 --> 45:35.994
Where will you be registered?
Fisher-Price?

45:36.037 --> 45:39.258
Everything is not a joke, Karl.

45:39.301 --> 45:41.477
You're not being funny,
you're being cruel.

45:41.521 --> 45:43.915
Oh, darling, I'm not trying
to be cruel. I love you.

45:43.958 --> 45:46.091
No, you don't!

45:46.134 --> 45:47.919
Not the way I need.

45:47.962 --> 45:49.790
I want a man
who loves me so much

45:49.834 --> 45:52.750
that he would kill another man
if I slept with someone else.

45:54.055 --> 45:56.666
And I'm never gonna get that
from you, am I?

45:56.710 --> 45:58.843
No.

46:03.543 --> 46:05.763
But you're my best friend.

46:05.806 --> 46:08.200
It's not enough.

46:21.082 --> 46:23.084
Shit.

46:27.175 --> 46:29.351
Yeah? Hey, babe.

46:29.395 --> 46:32.398
Hey. Why are you whispering?

46:32.441 --> 46:35.618
Oh, I was just, I was writing,
so, you know...

46:35.662 --> 46:38.273
...takes me a minute to get out
of the "in my head" voice

46:38.317 --> 46:40.710
and back into the
"out loud" voice.

46:40.754 --> 46:43.583
How did everything go?Oh, the conference was great,

46:43.626 --> 46:47.587
and my sisters...
are my sisters.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.981
Yeah.Look, if you're working,
I don't want to stop you.

46:50.024 --> 46:52.984
Um, is Jade up?
I can talk to her.

46:53.027 --> 46:56.465
