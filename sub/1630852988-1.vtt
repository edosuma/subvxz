A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.678 --> 00:13.138
Let's explore new movements.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.474
<i>Definitely more urban.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.485
<i>I want you to live</i>
<i>in someone else's skin.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.362
<i>To use music and dance</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:31.281
in order to connect with another reality.

00:35.326 --> 00:38.496
<i>From now on, if you don't stop</i>
<i>messing around playing the artist,</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:40.498
<i>you shouldn't count on me for anything.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:42.000
This is over.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.630
<i>I'm never going to stop dancing.</i>

01:01.686 --> 01:04.481
What's up, Karina? I'm Antonia.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.733
I need to become you.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.400
PURE STREET
FRIDAY 8 PM

02:46.291 --> 02:49.127
CONTINENTAL STEEL PARTNERSHIP

02:53.381 --> 02:55.550
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>
<i>that for a second</i>

02:55.633 --> 02:57.635
<i>my mom could put herself in my shoes.</i>

03:00.513 --> 03:03.516
And feel what I feel when I'm on stage.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.312
The adrenaline.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.232
The fear.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.319
The sheer joy.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.034
I think that it's your superpower.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.375
And what would yours be, if you had one?

03:31.336 --> 03:32.170
Mm.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.256
Mind control, for sure.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.472
Why's that?

03:43.264 --> 03:44.849
Dunno. Maybe, um…

03:45.850 --> 03:50.230
I'd be able to get in your head
so maybe you'd never stop missing me.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.070
Seriously?

03:57.153 --> 04:00.615
-Yeah, serious.
-There must be something

04:01.658 --> 04:03.660
you want and don't have.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.537
Mm-mm.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.791
I have it all.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.556
WARNING

04:31.187 --> 04:32.522
Good evening.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.571
Good evening.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.782
GENERAL SECURITY RULES

04:45.493 --> 04:47.495
Hey, darlin',
I'm sorry to disturb you so late,

04:47.578 --> 04:49.038
but could you help me with something?

04:49.122 --> 04:49.956
You see,

04:50.707 --> 04:53.001
I'm trying to get to this address here.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.981
PURE STREET

05:32.248 --> 05:33.833
Wow.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.084
Baby!

05:35.168 --> 05:36.961
Come smoke with me.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.880
Just a little bit. Just one hit.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.215
Mm, no. I want to be on point tomorrow.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.717
No, baby, you need to relax.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.927
-You'll feel better. Just a little bit.
-Mm.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.596
-Some wine.
-Yeah? Wine?

05:46.679 --> 05:47.513
Mm-hmm.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.391
You bring that stuff we talked about?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.517
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

05:52.685 --> 05:54.854
Man, do you see how stressed out she is?

05:54.937 --> 05:58.649
I need her to relax, to dance with me,
and stop thinking for just a minute.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.862
Mateo, Mateo, you know that girl, man.
Listen, once she's focused,

06:02.945 --> 06:04.530
ain't nobody distracting her.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.449
This isn't just focus.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.620
She's obsessed with this play,
to the point where she could get sick.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.914
Yeah, but why are you
surprised by that, huh?

06:12.997 --> 06:15.375
-Just let her do her.
-Mm.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.169
-That's all you. Later, man.
-I'm just trying to help.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.047
It's all right, man, you'll see.
She'll thank me for the best night ever.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.006
Uh-huh.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.907
Holy shit! Babe, are you okay?

08:11.449 --> 08:12.867
Baby! Antonia.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.327
-Girl.
-Baby.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.954
Hey, asshole, how much did you put?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.998
-Nothing, just a little.
-Then what's this about?

08:23.878 --> 08:26.964
Someone message her mom.
Tell her we're going to the hospital!

08:29.634 --> 08:32.345
Vicente, say something!
How the fuck is she?!

08:32.428 --> 08:34.847
I don't know. Bad. Just hurry up!

08:42.355 --> 08:43.898
ALTAGRACIA CLINIC

09:03.334 --> 09:06.295
"Don't worry, Mom,
I'm just rehearsing a new play."

09:06.379 --> 09:08.381
"I'm starring in it."

09:09.215 --> 09:10.049
Now look.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.134
A night in the hospital.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.555
Look at me.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.268
This is over.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.818
I won't quit.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.321
<i>I'm never going to stop dancing.</i>

09:35.533 --> 09:37.034
<i>Well, you don't have a choice.</i>

09:42.373 --> 09:46.168
Because from now on, if you don't stop
messing around playing the artist,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.212
you shouldn't count on me for anything.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.549
Especially if that damn
dance company is involved.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.054
How many times have I told you
to pursue a real career?

10:52.151 --> 10:58.366
ONE WEEK LATER

11:27.269 --> 11:29.605
All right, well done.
You've made me proud.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.614
You all know dance is my life.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.410
For years here at the Royal,
our job has been to discover and develop

11:42.493 --> 11:45.371
all the potential for intimacy
that dance can have,

11:45.454 --> 11:48.874
and to bring it
to the greatest stages in the world.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.210
That's why I brought in Jacob Brant.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.672
He's a great artistic director
and choreographer

11:54.755 --> 11:56.006
who you're surely heard of,

11:56.090 --> 11:59.260
because he's worked on some
of the best world-class productions.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.553
He's hot.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.889
I asked him to come
because I want the company

12:03.973 --> 12:06.183
to recover its place
in the Iberoamericano.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.022
If selected, I want you to know
what will be expected of you.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.317
I'll give the leads a scholarship to study

12:15.401 --> 12:17.194
at a prestigious school in New York.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.285
Remember, that's only if we get into
the Iberoamericano, okay?

12:25.494 --> 12:27.580
They're all yours. Go ahead.

12:29.665 --> 12:33.794
I imagine that you're all very tired,
so I'll get right to the point.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.087
I loved the show.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.174
The production was absolutely fantastic.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.010
However, I personally wasn't moved.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.097
To me, it was like the same old.

12:45.973 --> 12:46.891
Is he joking?

12:46.974 --> 12:47.850
Pardon?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.520
No, well, it's just…

12:52.104 --> 12:55.733
It's impossible
that you didn't connect with anyone.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.736
Shall I speak to your work? Very well.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.281
In the first duet
between Romeo and Juliet,

13:02.364 --> 13:04.450
Juliet was nowhere to be found.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.119
A little girl trying to show off
was the only thing I saw.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.874
As I was saying, I like the play,
and I want to keep certain elements,

13:11.957 --> 13:14.376
but work from a completely
different perspective.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.295
I want to get away from everyday life,

13:16.378 --> 13:18.088
from your day-to-day routines,

13:18.172 --> 13:21.342
so you can take your masks off
and begin to work as a team.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.593
It's not fair.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.845
I want you to live
in someone else's skin.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.599
You should use music and dance
in order to connect with another reality.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.309
Let's explore new movements too.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.355
I sent an invitation to the company chat

13:34.438 --> 13:37.942
for an event happening tomorrow,
as well as some research you can use.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.070
So please take a look
and get everything you can from it.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.114
And what about everything
we've worked on up to this point?

13:44.198 --> 13:47.493
Antonia, as Jacob explained,
we'll be starting from scratch.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.580
Which means I'll be auditioning
for every part,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.999
including Romeo and Juliet.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.420
Thank you.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.478
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Son of a bitch.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.188
Come on, Miranda can fix this.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.274
-No, forget it.
-"Forget it"?

14:18.941 --> 14:21.735
Antonia, you can't just give up
without a fight.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.363
We're talking about your career,
your future, everything.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.115
We have to talk to Miranda.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.032
"We do"?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.286
I don't understand
why you're using the plural.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.747
I'm just trying to help.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.833
Mm. To help, huh?

14:37.251 --> 14:40.754
Like when you wanted to help me have fun
at your house and almost killed me?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.173
Look, I know that I screwed up--

14:43.257 --> 14:45.009
I trusted you, Mateo.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.219
How many times do I have to apologize?

14:48.888 --> 14:49.889
Just stop, then.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.473
It's done.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.864
<i>What's up, guys?</i>

15:06.947 --> 15:08.616
<i>-We are…</i>
<i>-Pure Street.</i>

15:08.699 --> 15:12.077
<i>And we want to invite you</i>
<i>to a party that's going down</i>

15:12.161 --> 15:15.998
<i>this Friday starting at 7:00,</i>
<i>at the club Al Garete.</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:32.324
Ma, what's up?

16:33.951 --> 16:34.785
There you are.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.995
What's this?

16:36.078 --> 16:39.206
I did some research,
and we still have time to apply to these,

16:39.289 --> 16:41.333
so what do you want to study?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.425
Really, Mom?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.554
You think I can do this?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.056
Be a lawyer?

16:57.558 --> 17:00.352
I can't see myself
doing anything but dancing.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.731
It's my life.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.066
Dance is not a life, Antonia.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.736
It's a hobby, a whim.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.822
You're an adult.
You need to think about your future.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.575
Mom, please…

17:14.658 --> 17:15.492
Ma…

17:53.989 --> 17:57.201
Vince, I've been looking
everywhere for you. Where were you?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.703
You didn't answer your phone. Come on.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.997
Why do we want to go
to this party?

18:02.081 --> 18:05.000
-What do you mean? We agreed.
-No one said we had to go.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.878
My mom started going off
about me picking another career.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.131
Well then what can we do?

18:12.424 --> 18:13.258
We go.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.136
I need that scholarship
now more than ever.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.931
So if this guy wants us there,
we're going.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.394
MATEO
LET ME GO WITH YOU

18:24.478 --> 18:26.396
He should come with us, right?

18:28.065 --> 18:31.068
Come on, girl.
It's a sketchy neighborhood.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.779
Like him?

18:35.864 --> 18:37.783
ANTONIA
CALLING

18:39.535 --> 18:41.995
-<i>The voicemail box for…</i>
<i>-…Antonia…</i>

18:42.079 --> 18:44.081
<i>…is currently unavailable.</i>

18:44.832 --> 18:46.208
SLIDE TO CANCEL

18:46.291 --> 18:47.126
Baby…

18:49.461 --> 18:50.671
When are you gonna stop?

18:51.171 --> 18:53.090
Aren't we supposed to be a team,
you and I?

18:53.173 --> 18:57.469
We're better than all the rest
of these fucking losers in this world.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.638
No.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.775
ANTONIA
WE WERE.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.320
THIS CONTACT HAS BLOCKED YOU

19:27.166 --> 19:29.293
I know, I know. I'm on my way.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.044
As soon as I get there,
we'll check lights,

19:31.128 --> 19:33.255
we'll do sound,
we'll rehearse real quick and…

19:33.338 --> 19:36.175
<i>Karina Rojas,</i>
<i>report to the main office.</i>

19:37.551 --> 19:39.344
Motherfucker.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.679
Oh my God.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.642
-<i>…go over sound, and rehearse…</i>
-Okay.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.811
Oh, God.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.189
That's awful.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.274
No, no, no! That's not…

19:52.357 --> 19:53.775
Then I won't do this shit for you,

19:53.859 --> 19:56.236
and you can give me back
the fucking wig I made.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.406
You don't appreciate anything.
You don't value me as an artist.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.618
Bitch, you don't value my creativity,
and I don't deserve it, dude.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.412
For real, I don't deserve it.
Next time, just kill me.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.790
Kill me. If you don't like anything I do,
just murder me.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.960
Oh my! It's the queen of all drama.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.295
Whatever.

20:13.378 --> 20:18.425
Mm. Drama's in Venezuela. Haven't sent
money to my parents in two months.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.594
You know when we get paid for this show?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.763
My friend.

20:28.936 --> 20:29.770
Come here, girl.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.692
Relax, okay? What did I say, huh?

20:35.776 --> 20:37.903
I said I'm gonna take care of it
with Karina,

20:37.986 --> 20:41.281
and all you have to do, homie,
is move that ass.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.825
-Relax, would you, please?
-Oh, that's right.

20:43.909 --> 20:44.743
Not you!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.914
-Yeah, we good.
-Are you gonna wear my wig?

20:48.997 --> 20:50.540
Yes, it's on already.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.377
-Come in, Karina.
-I'm headed out.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.587
You were. Come on in.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.672
Go ahead.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.717
Well, it would appear
that the cutting machine broke,

21:00.801 --> 21:02.094
and I need those materials moved.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.013
Ooh… Don Toño,
remember that thing we discussed?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.932
That event tonight with the group?

21:07.015 --> 21:09.017
It's important and you said
that it was no problem.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.270
I know I said that, but look.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.147
Something's wrong with the machine.
What can we do?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.108
I hear you, but I just can't stay.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.192
Pardon?

21:17.901 --> 21:22.906
Do you know how lucky you are, Karina?
You get benefits, and also paid vacations.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.285
Healthcare for your brother, your grandma,
and you. Aren't you a dancer?

21:26.368 --> 21:29.204
I understand that, but not today, sir.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.957
I can't cancel this.
This event is too important to me.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.920
Listen, Karina, you think I don't know
that you girls made that promo video here?

21:38.463 --> 21:41.425
But chill, mama.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.677
You owe me one.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.179
Go to your event. Go on.

22:13.707 --> 22:14.666
Thank you.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.293
Thanks.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.765
Well, this is it, right?

22:29.848 --> 22:31.516
Hey, girl, it's already poppin'.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.229
-Do you see this?
-What? Oh, no.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.731
Come on. Stay positive.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.192
-Don't want to hear it.
-Let's take a taxi. Serious?

22:42.486 --> 22:44.071
-Welcome, guys.
-Thanks.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.531
-Hi.
-Good evening.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.117
-So you guys got the entrance fee?
-Sure. How much?

22:50.285 --> 22:51.995
-Fifty bucks.
-Here's a hundred.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.998
-And fifty.
-And fifty.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.709
Will the doorman let us in now or what?

23:00.545 --> 23:01.797
Doorman?

23:02.381 --> 23:03.799
You know what? Ignore him.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.509
You got your ID?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.177
Seriously?

23:07.260 --> 23:11.348
Do you honestly think any of us
are under 18 years old?

23:11.431 --> 23:13.475
Yeah, but looks can be deceiving, right?

23:13.558 --> 23:15.685
Yeah, sure.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.312
Pombo?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.065
What are you doing in this hood?

23:20.148 --> 23:23.360
Do they pay you to watch the door
or sweet-talk the clients, huh?

23:23.443 --> 23:26.029
-Can we <i>please</i> come in?
-Take this.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.949
-Of course, sweetheart. Please, come in.
-Thank you.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.243
All good. Enjoy, guys.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.487
Man, I thought we knew how to party, huh?

25:11.843 --> 25:12.969
Yo, listen up.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.681
You know what the deal is, right?
Money up front.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.892
-Anyone tries to fuck with you, you just--
-Hey.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.769
-What's good?
-Hey! Yo, what's up, sis?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.604
-The girls?
-This side waiting. Go ahead.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.314
And the producer? Is he here too?

25:24.940 --> 25:25.857
He's not here yet.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.069
Hey, but chill, homie. Chill.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.654
We still have some time.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.657
-Just have a little faith.
-Mm-hmm.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.450
No, you guys know I have faith.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.495
It's just… all this
being paid for with faith, huh?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.455
We need a serious deal.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.207
-That's true.
-Have you talked to Grandma?

25:42.290 --> 25:44.334
-Oh, no.
-Álex, come on.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.753
-I'll call her. I promise.
-She's sick, man.

25:46.836 --> 25:49.130
I gotta focus on you right now.
You gotta be up on stage.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.383
Come on, leave the family stuff
alone for now, guys.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.176
-All good.
-What are you doing? Get changed.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.261
I'm serious. Call Grandma!

25:54.344 --> 25:55.554
-Good luck.
-Break a leg!

25:55.637 --> 25:56.471
Of course.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.182
Hey, man. She can't know
about this stuff, all right?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.475
No.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.519
You know if she does,
we'll both be fucked.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.895
-Yeah, I got it.
-Okay, good.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.107
Hey! Could you get me something to drink?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.608
-Come on, homie!
-Come on.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.194
Get me something to drink,
you fucking idiot, would you?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.696
Sorry, sorry.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.030
Kari!

26:14.781 --> 26:17.284
Hey. What a day, but it's done.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.663
-I'm here, and everything's cool.
-You talk to Checho?

26:21.746 --> 26:23.748
Yes, I asked him about it yesterday.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.459
The producer isn't here yet,
but he should be soon.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.836
And if he doesn't come?

26:28.837 --> 26:30.463
-He'll be here.
-He'll be here.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.259
I did a little research, and this guy
works with some major players, dude.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.427
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.097
That's what I need.
Someone serious to see this ass in action.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.974
Look him up on Escena.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.560
He saw that one video we did.
Remember?

26:43.643 --> 26:44.644
Yeah.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.816
-Wow, cool.
-He's bad-ass.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.402
We're bad-ass too, baby.

26:52.902 --> 26:58.450
He'll be right up front,
and when he sees us…

26:59.784 --> 27:01.536
We're gonna make him drool.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.455
And what's next?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.790
You telling your boss
to fuck off, that's what.

27:13.006 --> 27:17.636
What's good, fans?
How's everybody feeling tonight?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.515
All my fellas,

27:22.599 --> 27:26.019
and all my sexy ladies, get ready

27:26.102 --> 27:28.438
because these girls

27:28.521 --> 27:31.358
are gonna rock the house, y'all!

27:32.984 --> 27:34.527
Give it up

27:34.611 --> 27:38.657
for Pure Street!

28:56.443 --> 29:01.156
If Jacob thinks that I'm actually going to
shake my ass like that…

29:01.239 --> 29:05.243
-…he's nuts, man. Not even during sex.
-Clearly.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.533
Man, that guy was right.

29:46.659 --> 29:47.494
Yeah.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.162
They're incredible.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.856
Bravo!

30:17.524 --> 30:19.609
That chick's name is Karina.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.194
She's the leader of the group.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.862
And how can I meet her?

30:22.946 --> 30:25.406
-Huh?
-How can I get in touch with her?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.367
You gotta speak to me first.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.246
Tell me, cutie.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.706
Was it worth the price of the show?

30:34.290 --> 30:35.917
Well, you scammed us, I think.

30:36.918 --> 30:37.877
At the door.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.380
-Sorry?
-The tickets.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.007
You think I don't know
that you overcharged us?

30:43.091 --> 30:45.426
Hey, you were asking for it.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.887
I want it back.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.808
Give it back. I'm serious.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.269
You know what?

30:57.605 --> 30:58.481
All right.

30:59.649 --> 31:00.817
Antonia Pombo.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.027
How about we make a deal, okay?

31:04.445 --> 31:07.282
Okay, how about I pay for the first round,

31:08.116 --> 31:10.118
and if by the end of both of our drinks,

31:10.201 --> 31:13.788
if I don't drive you crazy, well then,
you can buy the second round.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.874
Is that cool?

31:17.417 --> 31:18.376
Hey.

31:19.085 --> 31:20.879
What's good?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.380
Hey, pay me first.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.467
Dude, I told you that night
Antonia wasn't up for it.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.469
-That's more like it.
-What do you want?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.972
What do I want?
I want you to talk to her, that's what!

31:31.055 --> 31:33.016
Mateo, if you keep pushing,
you'll fuck it up more.

31:33.099 --> 31:33.933
Leave her alone.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.936
No, Vicente, I can't leave her alone!
Don't you get it? I can't!

31:37.020 --> 31:38.354
She's just ignoring me.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.357
I talk, it's like I'm not there.
I mean, I don't get it. I…

31:41.941 --> 31:43.401
I left everything.

31:43.484 --> 31:47.238
My family, my home, my friends. All of it.
And now she won't talk to me.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.990
-I don't get it. Was it that bad?
-Hey, yo!

31:49.073 --> 31:50.033
You all right?

31:50.867 --> 31:51.701
Yeah.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.787
You promised me you'd talk to her,
and you didn't.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.206
I'll just talk to her. You know, fuck it!

32:01.461 --> 32:02.670
Sure you're okay, man?

32:03.630 --> 32:04.505
Yeah.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.884
Yo, I've seen you before.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.387
I'm not that famous. Just sayin'.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.023
That little dude you came with, who's he?

32:23.399 --> 32:24.525
Together, or what?

32:26.069 --> 32:27.528
None of your business.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.907
Checho, what about the producer?

32:31.532 --> 32:34.285
-He's around here somewhere.
-Yeah, but where?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.954
You just gotta be ready for him, okay?

32:36.037 --> 32:38.414
If you're sick tomorrow,
I'll make something up

32:38.498 --> 32:41.459
so I can go with you to the doctor,
all right, Grandma? Bye.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.669
Álex?

32:45.421 --> 32:46.589
-Hey!
-Álex!

32:48.216 --> 32:49.968
-Motherfucker, get back here!
-Álex!

32:50.051 --> 32:51.678
-You steal my wallet?
-Wait a sec.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.845
-Give it back!
-Let go of me!

32:52.929 --> 32:54.472
-Yo, watch where you're going.
-Hey!

32:54.555 --> 32:57.100
-Come on. You bumped me and grabbed it.
-I didn't.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.311
-Yo. Hey, man, it's okay.
-Let's go to security!

33:00.395 --> 33:02.397
-Mateo, stop!
-Let her go.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.942
Hey, hey, get off her!

33:08.903 --> 33:10.405
Hey, come on!

33:10.488 --> 33:11.990
Move away. Come on.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.985
Hey!

33:49.068 --> 33:50.653
Hey, come over here. Come over.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.865
-Careful.
-Dude!

33:53.948 --> 33:55.992
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hey!

33:56.075 --> 33:58.202
-Back the fuck off!
-What the--

33:58.286 --> 34:01.622
Stop! Hey, Checho, stop!
Stop! Hey, that's enough!

34:01.706 --> 34:03.124
Enough, all right?

34:03.207 --> 34:06.169
Some asshole just said
that I stole his stupid-ass wallet.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.254
All right, everyone out!

34:08.337 --> 34:09.422
Let's go!

34:11.507 --> 34:14.802
Yes. No, no, officer.
Everything was calm inside,

34:14.886 --> 34:16.971
and then all of a sudden,
bottles started flying

34:17.055 --> 34:18.556
and a fight broke out.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.809
Then you guys showed up,
and that's all I saw.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.603
-Yeah, yeah.
-Right?

34:23.686 --> 34:26.439
-You guys weren't ready.
-Seriously, girl?

34:26.522 --> 34:28.483
-No--
-This wasn't only my fault.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.943
-Whose, then?
-And what about your bouncers?

34:31.027 --> 34:32.779
Aren't they here to protect us?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.198
They should've had this shit
under control.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.784
-What do you want?
-My money.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.996
Our agreement was that you
would keep the door,

34:42.080 --> 34:43.456
and I would keep the bar.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.500
Right now, it's only 11:00.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.502
On a good night, I close at 3:00.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.796
Do the math.
I didn't get to sell a lot of drinks.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.881
All right, that wasn't our deal--

34:51.964 --> 34:55.384
Look, I'm really sorry. But the money
from the door goes right here.

34:55.468 --> 34:58.429
There's no way I'm going to be
the only one to lose on this.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.140
-Dude!
-Hey, yo, they need you real quick.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.850
-Hello there.
-Son of a bitch.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.352
What's up, Karina?

35:07.814 --> 35:08.856
Are you Joe?

35:08.940 --> 35:11.150
That's right.
Joey Alexander Jaramillo.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.736
How's it going, girls? You good?

35:15.238 --> 35:17.532
So listen, I have an artist in Medellín.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.700
This guy's absolutely killing it.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.786
I mean, he's making a ton of hits.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.496
I put together a concert,

35:23.579 --> 35:26.249
and we're looking for a dance crew
to back him up.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.543
Uh, yeah, well, you're looking at it.

35:29.210 --> 35:32.004
I've been following you for a few months.
You're great.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.965
And for real, I'd like to help you out.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.425
Well, let's hear it.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.344
Let's cut to the chase, okay?

35:38.427 --> 35:40.680
Come to Medellín. Do a couple rehearsals.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.974
If everything clicks, the job's all yours.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.600
If not, then what?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.227
If not, then no worries.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.522
You can keep looking
for opportunities elsewhere,

35:49.605 --> 35:51.232
and I'll look for someone else.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.778
I'll leave you with that. Think about it.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.905
If you're into it, cool.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.910
-Seriously?
-I don't wanna hear about it.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.497
-I know, right?
-He saw us.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.832
Come on now, chica chica.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.208
Tell me, please.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.170
What the hell should I have done,
stay quiet while they robbed me?

36:12.253 --> 36:13.629
-Why are you even here?
-Huh?

36:13.713 --> 36:14.881
Why are you here?

36:14.964 --> 36:16.799
Why am I? The same reason you are.
That guy--

36:16.883 --> 36:20.219
Oh come on, Mateo!
Since when do you care about this stuff?

36:20.303 --> 36:22.847
It's always just a game to you.
You don't care.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.974
You walk all over everyone.
You don't care!

36:25.057 --> 36:27.226
Stop, stop, just for a second!
What could I do?

36:27.310 --> 36:29.854
You knew what the situation was
with my mom.

36:29.937 --> 36:33.900
I mean, you totally knew what was
on the line, and you still did that shit!

36:33.983 --> 36:35.985
-I'm sorry. I--
-You ruined it all!

36:37.195 --> 36:39.488
-I'm fucked, asshole.
-Don't tell me I ruined your life.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.449
-Baby, I'm sorry. I didn't want--
-Well, you did.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.326
And on top of that, you almost killed me.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.870
-I ended up in the hospital.
-It was an accident! What are you--

36:45.953 --> 36:47.246
Sir, are you available?

36:47.330 --> 36:49.040
-Let go. No!
-I'll take you home. Let's talk.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.583
I don't want to be in a car with you.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.710
Vicente, come on!

37:06.015 --> 37:08.142
Just three million pesos
and we're in Medellín.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.394
-No, something's not right.
-Why not?

37:10.978 --> 37:12.438
That dude is shady.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.650
He has no money,
and he won't pay for our tickets.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.444
Man, if he was paying,
I'd go right now and dance.

37:18.527 --> 37:21.113
-But he's not doing that, dumbass.
-It's an opportunity.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.574
Yeah, for him to make money off of us.
No, girl.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.326
You're exaggerating.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.120
He's gonna make money
from the concert, not from us.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.455
I don't get you, dude.

37:29.538 --> 37:32.041
How long have we been
working our asses off?

37:32.124 --> 37:34.835
We've been searching for someone
who would see us, and here he is!

37:35.378 --> 37:36.671
We finally have a chance.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.756
And instead of taking it,
we're talking like this.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.925
Are you serious? For real.

37:41.008 --> 37:43.719
You're not seeing the things
that I'm seeing.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.096
Oh yeah? What's that, Karina?

37:45.179 --> 37:47.556
Just chill. Okay, guys?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.725
At first, there's gonna be some bullshit.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.520
You think I'm not
working hard enough, right?

37:53.229 --> 37:54.897
Well, I'm all-in at this point.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.774
I'm sick of putting up
with my fucking uncle.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.943
You know he's always screwing with me.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.487
But all I care about is Pure Street.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.490
The thing is,
we can't forget that life's a bitch.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.575
It's easy for some, but not for us.

38:06.659 --> 38:10.496
We're not allowed to have a dream.
We work our butts off just to eat.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.083
-How we gonna come up with three million?
-We'll get it.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.627
-From where? Three million pesos?
-Ximena, we'll get it.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.088
From where? It's impossible.

38:20.131 --> 38:20.965
Yep.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.678
Thanks. Thanks.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.264
Thank you, María José.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.349
Who's next?

39:13.392 --> 39:14.310
Who's next?

39:15.978 --> 39:18.147
Hey! I am.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.446
Whenever you're ready.

39:57.144 --> 39:58.145
Yes?

40:00.439 --> 40:01.649
Is it the bank?

40:08.114 --> 40:09.698
-Everything okay?
-I'll call you in a bit.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.079
Thanks.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.965
Thank you, everybody.

40:32.638 --> 40:36.350
-And what is the emergency?
-It's a family thing.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.020
Ah. You know,
we love it here when people thrive,

40:40.104 --> 40:42.189
pay off their debts, study,
and all of that, right?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.899
But this is the first time I've done this.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.902
An advance?

40:46.986 --> 40:49.405
Oh and by the way,
what are you doing tonight?

40:49.488 --> 40:50.364
You got plans?

40:52.825 --> 40:54.827
Uh, what? Plans? I don't…

40:54.910 --> 40:57.621
I'd love to take you out
to someplace nice, you know?

40:57.705 --> 40:59.540
Somewhere beautiful, elegant…

41:02.293 --> 41:04.712
Well, what better opportunity is there?

41:08.549 --> 41:09.925
When should I pick you up?

41:12.261 --> 41:13.095
And where?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.851
Now for the leading roles.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.604
And, of course,
these are not set in stone.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.648
We'll start with the character of Romeo.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.775
There were two auditions I liked. Uh…

41:26.859 --> 41:27.860
-Mateo.
-Yes!

41:27.943 --> 41:29.069
There you go!

41:29.153 --> 41:30.654
Good job. And Vicente.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.364
-Vince!
-Nice!

41:32.448 --> 41:33.407
Are you serious?

41:33.491 --> 41:36.535
We saw a lot of character in your work,
so congratulations.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.371
I'm worried about your knee.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.832
That's the only reason
you're the understudy.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.254
And for the character of Juliet…

41:51.759 --> 41:52.760
the audition from…

41:54.303 --> 41:56.805
-María. Very good.
-Yes!

41:58.349 --> 42:00.309
A very honest audition. Congratulations.

42:00.392 --> 42:03.062
There's still a lot of work to do,
María José.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.481
But a great way to begin.

42:05.564 --> 42:06.899
I'm sorry, I don't agree.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.487
Tell us why you don't agree.

42:13.155 --> 42:14.782
What was your criteria?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.201
My criteria?

42:17.284 --> 42:21.372
I went to the bar like you said,
I prepared an original choreography,

42:21.872 --> 42:23.249
and I rehearsed it all night.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.042
Yes, that shows.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.293
But I don't believe it.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.549
Your interpretation is not real.
It's clear.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.677
So to you, the only real audition
was from María José?

42:34.760 --> 42:36.178
I'm sorry?

42:37.888 --> 42:39.598
-Antonia.
-No, it's true.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.809
I tried to bring you something different.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.645
What did you bring that was different?
A new outfit?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.064
That wasn't all.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.733
Is that right?

42:50.359 --> 42:52.319
You think no one else
wants that scholarship?

42:52.403 --> 42:53.529
I just…

42:53.612 --> 42:56.949
It's not enough.
You have to earn it. Moving on.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.455
Antonia.

43:04.915 --> 43:05.749
Antonia.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.585
Mateo, go to hell.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.133
You can't be serious.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.343
Because I've paid on time for years,

43:16.427 --> 43:18.762
and it's not fair
for you to do this to me now.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.145
Is Miranda there?

43:26.228 --> 43:28.439
-Yes, but she's busy.
-I need to talk to her.

43:29.982 --> 43:31.233
Just a minute, please.

43:31.900 --> 43:32.776
What happened?

43:34.153 --> 43:35.029
You knew about this?

43:36.363 --> 43:37.489
Tell me, please.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.491
There's nothing I can do.

43:39.575 --> 43:42.995
-It's out of my hands.
-No, Miranda, this is so messed up to do.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.998
If I don't get that scholarship,
I can't stay at the Royal.

43:46.081 --> 43:47.333
Antonia!

43:49.585 --> 43:51.503
I gave everything to this company.

43:52.087 --> 43:53.380
Jacob's here to help me.

43:54.048 --> 43:57.384
And if he doesn't think
you have what it takes to be the lead,

43:57.468 --> 43:58.385
I won't contradict it.

44:00.012 --> 44:00.846
I'm sorry.

44:23.243 --> 44:24.536
ROYAL ACADEMY

45:14.169 --> 45:19.007
TOÑO
I'M ARRIVING

45:27.891 --> 45:28.809
KARINA
COUNT US IN.

45:28.892 --> 45:29.727
Huh.

45:31.979 --> 45:32.855
Hey, Karina!

45:34.314 --> 45:35.482
Someone's outside.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.290
What's up, Karina?

45:52.541 --> 45:53.459
I'm Antonia.

45:54.460 --> 45:57.296
I don't know if you remember me,
but I was there last night.

45:57.379 --> 45:58.297
I saw you dance.

45:58.380 --> 45:59.840
Why are you here?

46:00.507 --> 46:04.178
-Well, I wanted to talk to you--
-Do you know how much trouble you caused?

46:04.762 --> 46:05.888
-Yeah.
-You do, or you don't?

46:05.971 --> 46:08.056
-That's why--
-You do? Leave. Álex!

46:08.140 --> 46:09.266
-Listen--
-I want you gone.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.726
Just one second.

46:10.809 --> 46:13.353
You're crazy to come down here.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.983
Well, the reason I'm here is important.

46:20.152 --> 46:21.320
It's a proposal.

46:23.113 --> 46:25.783
It's something that
only you can help me with.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.536
And what can I help you with?

46:31.705 --> 46:32.998
I need to become you.
