00:17.209 --> 00:20.795
Music is a lot of fun.

00:20.879 --> 00:24.383
You can rock.
You can do rock,

00:24.465 --> 00:28.178
jazz... Even...
even classical.

00:28.262 --> 00:32.015
It's a good thing for you
to do music.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.975
Everybody says it's good.

00:34.059 --> 00:37.520
I'm kinda like...
I kinda like it.

00:42.984 --> 00:44.861
Mitch!

00:44.945 --> 00:46.321
Hey, I'm Scott.

00:46.405 --> 00:49.074
I love to perform
and sing.

00:49.157 --> 00:51.076
I wanna show Avi something.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.913
Avi and Esther
turn around and wave!

00:54.996 --> 00:55.997
Hi.

00:56.081 --> 00:57.249
Avi!

00:59.334 --> 01:01.044
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:01.586 --> 01:07.426
Now that we've already begun
the Kaplan kids great adventure,

01:07.508 --> 01:08.969
where are we now?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.893
They were, like,
"We're gonna put the Grammy here."

01:17.018 --> 01:18.270
I was, like, "Oh!"

01:18.437 --> 01:21.148
No, no, it's not because
I want it.

01:21.231 --> 01:23.524
It's because I'm afraid
you'll lose it.

01:23.608 --> 01:25.026
Yeah, okay.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.159
Now, I'll sing "Love Story."

See if I get it now.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.643
It's better.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.430
Avi gave me
a voice lesson.

02:35.514 --> 02:40.018
And, now I feel like I'm starting to learn
to place things to where I can project.

02:40.185 --> 02:41.936
- All right.
- Yeah.

02:51.821 --> 02:54.615
I did like parts of it.
It feels really low.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.574
Did we do it too low?

02:55.658 --> 02:57.202
Feel like we're low.
I think it was low.

02:57.285 --> 02:58.870
- Felt a little low.
- I think it's too low.

02:58.953 --> 03:00.497
So, wait. So, it's...
So, it's C-minor.

03:00.621 --> 03:03.166
What... Wasn't...
What were you guys just in, B?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.709
- I have no idea.
- Oh, then try C.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.002
C?

03:09.172 --> 03:10.757
Three, four.

03:53.592 --> 03:54.759
Shut the...

04:04.436 --> 04:05.520
That's it.

04:05.604 --> 04:08.607
Just so you guys know,
when they are ready for you,

04:08.689 --> 04:09.983
I think they're just
going to do

04:10.066 --> 04:11.401
a walk-through
of the design elements

04:11.485 --> 04:13.027
but they're not ready
for all of you.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.112
I think that's what's
happening--

04:14.195 --> 04:15.363
Just getting a little
presentation ready.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.449
So, I think it's just gonna...
They're all just gonna show off.

04:17.697 --> 04:18.575
I'm excited!

04:18.658 --> 04:19.951
- Yeah, it's really cool.
- That's exciting!

04:20.034 --> 04:23.871
We're just showing you what it looks
like in a general basic format right now.

04:24.205 --> 04:25.206
I think
it's all right.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.167
- Cool!
- Fingers crossed, man.

04:28.042 --> 04:30.462
So how's it feel to be Grammy award winners, huh?

04:30.545 --> 04:31.754
Really exciting!

04:31.838 --> 04:32.922
I can imagine, guys.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.215
Super weird.

04:34.382 --> 04:35.758
That's pretty awesome, huh.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.968
I'm already excited!

04:37.051 --> 04:38.136
It's exciting.

04:39.095 --> 04:43.099
I think the fans are gonna react like we reacted when we first saw.

04:43.558 --> 04:46.686
First of all,
we're walking into an arena.

04:46.936 --> 04:49.230
I don't think we've ever played an arena this big.

04:49.314 --> 04:51.608
I mean, it's just... It's just
really cool and amazing

04:51.691 --> 04:52.775
to even just be here.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.321
I didn't really know what else to expect.
I just knew it was going to be amazing.

04:56.404 --> 05:00.408
Travis was showing us
everything. And it just...

05:01.951 --> 05:03.537
- You guys ready?
- All right, uh...

05:03.620 --> 05:06.581
Doug, let's go on lift number one, please.

05:07.957 --> 05:10.751
Holy molly!

05:10.918 --> 05:12.379
Oh, my God.
That's a nice set.

05:12.462 --> 05:15.173
And then all the lights came on.
And we just freaked out.

05:15.256 --> 05:17.717
It was just epic.
It looks like a real show.

05:19.511 --> 05:20.387
It's moving.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.180
Oh, my God.
This is sick.

05:22.263 --> 05:23.390
Ah!

05:23.473 --> 05:24.849
Wow, this is
very awesome.

05:24.974 --> 05:27.352
Let's walk you guys on stage and show you what we have there,

05:27.477 --> 05:29.229
just to get you comfortable
with all that.

05:29.688 --> 05:33.066
Our parents are gonna die.
They're gonna be like, "Whoa"!

05:33.191 --> 05:37.736
It's just really crazy to know that this is our set.
Like, we worked for this,

05:37.820 --> 05:41.824
and it makes sense for us.
And that's the craziest part about it, is that,

05:41.908 --> 05:44.494
is that this actually
makes sense for us now.

05:44.994 --> 05:47.746
Can I step on them?
I already went for it.

05:47.872 --> 05:52.043
It exceeded our expectations ten fold.
I think it inspired us all, too.

05:52.126 --> 05:54.546
We're gonna be performing
way more full out.

05:54.629 --> 05:57.798
We're gonna feel more legit.
The fans are gonna feel like they're at a concert.

05:57.882 --> 05:59.175
Rather than
like a recital.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.968
Exactly, yeah.
It may be a capella,

06:01.052 --> 06:03.388
but when they come to the show and see everything

06:03.513 --> 06:05.640
they're gonna be like,
"This is a rock concert."

06:06.140 --> 06:07.225
I really think
the choreography--

06:07.308 --> 06:08.142
Hi!

06:08.268 --> 06:09.894
Chore-- Speaking
of choreography...

06:09.977 --> 06:10.937
Here we go.

06:11.020 --> 06:11.979
Here we go.

06:12.689 --> 06:13.814
Good to see you.
How are you?

06:13.898 --> 06:14.857
Good to see you.

06:14.982 --> 06:16.276
You guys,
remember at the AMAs,

06:16.359 --> 06:19.112
we performed on a small little janky stage in the corner,

06:19.195 --> 06:20.905
- like, with cables everywhere.
- Yeah.

06:20.988 --> 06:22.949
And now you guys are here.
Like, it's...

06:23.032 --> 06:25.326
But you know what?
Like, moments like that is what

06:25.410 --> 06:27.454
makes you appreciate coming
out on stage right now

06:27.537 --> 06:29.497
and being, like, look what
you've just been given.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.166
So, I'm excited.
I'm so ready.

06:36.254 --> 06:39.299
So, since intro,
we don't see them until the solo--

06:39.382 --> 06:41.134
Can we hear...
Do you have the audio of that intro again?

06:41.259 --> 06:43.219
We can
just sing it if you want.

06:43.762 --> 06:45.179
You'll be able
to hear it that way.

06:46.097 --> 06:47.932
We're not prepared, but...

06:48.141 --> 06:50.560
Oh, my God.
I love you guys right now.

to do anything
you're thinking of.

08:15.936 --> 08:17.605
Let's take this
to the limits.

08:23.444 --> 08:26.447
I was very excited to start because
I knew we were going to up production.

08:26.531 --> 08:28.533
Like, we have
an entire new crew.

08:28.616 --> 08:31.661
Not all of it has come together yet,
but that's kind of even more exciting

08:31.745 --> 08:35.456
because it's...
When it all finally comes together it's gonna be amazing.

08:35.998 --> 08:38.418
Pretty big show, you know.
This is four trucks of gear.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.294
Um, you know,
115 moving lights,

08:41.379 --> 08:44.799
a crew of 30 people.
This is no small show.

08:46.008 --> 08:47.886
There's just
so much more to be done.

08:47.968 --> 08:50.137
We are just a very
detail-oriented group.

08:50.221 --> 08:51.639
And there's like a lot
to be done--

08:51.723 --> 08:55.309
A lot of details to lock in before, oh, God,
I don't know--

08:55.435 --> 08:57.061
- Our show on Wednesday.
- Yeah.

09:03.150 --> 09:06.987
Want some Goldfish?

09:09.198 --> 09:11.451
How embarrassing for him.
Goldfish are the best.

09:12.911 --> 09:15.455
So, this how it's gonna
go down all the time?

09:15.538 --> 09:18.958
Just a bunch
of cameras around?

09:19.709 --> 09:20.919
I don't mind it.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.546
I will definitely be eating
100 percent of the time.

09:29.093 --> 09:31.011
No! You can't... You can't
in front of the camera.

09:31.137 --> 09:34.557
No. Of course I was gonna not say, probably,
what I was gonna say.

09:34.682 --> 09:36.810
No, but you have to say what you were gonna say normally.

09:36.893 --> 09:39.437
Okay, I don't know what I would say.
Probably something rude.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.939
Really rude.
It would have been funny!

09:41.021 --> 09:42.690
Like, why are you
asking me? I'm busy.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.902
This means you had a good run through with rehearsal.
That's good.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.071
Oh, good. Stop!

09:49.280 --> 09:50.323
This is my sister.

09:50.406 --> 09:51.407
That's true.

09:53.367 --> 09:58.038
I would say it's gone
pretty not super-smooth.

09:58.873 --> 09:59.916
Not super-smooth.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.753
We're stressed out because
we have so much to do,

10:03.837 --> 10:05.964
but always comes together
as they say.

10:06.547 --> 10:09.926
We're gonna fly on Tuesday.
One o' clock on Tuesday.

10:11.218 --> 10:12.386
And we're landing at 3:30

10:12.470 --> 10:15.640
and then we're rehearsing
starting at 5:00 on Tuesday.

10:15.723 --> 10:18.225
And then our show
is the next day.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.061
So, we're just gonna hope, at five,
that all of it is basically perfect?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.607
Fingers crossed.
I'm paranoid about it.

10:25.149 --> 10:27.234
- Okay, and what's today? Friday?
- Yes.

10:27.443 --> 10:28.987
Oh, my God,
are we going out?

10:30.530 --> 10:33.491
I'm proud of you.
Yeah, you guys did this.

10:33.741 --> 10:35.242
I'm so very, very
proud of you.

10:35.326 --> 10:37.036
- Love you. Thank you.
- Yeah, I love you too.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.789
And I'm really looking forward to seeing you guys in Oakland.

10:54.303 --> 10:57.056
The plan.
Not slipping again.

11:02.812 --> 11:04.397
I know,
it's so intrusive.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.899
At least
I'm eating a salad.

11:08.234 --> 11:12.363
I think that this tour is the first tour where we finally felt,

11:12.572 --> 11:15.408
we were, like,
playing in the big leagues.

11:15.533 --> 11:18.953
Like, we started at the bottom.
You know what I mean?

11:19.746 --> 11:21.998
And we just slowly worked
our way up.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.458
This is the culmination...

11:25.459 --> 11:26.961
...of everything
we've worked for.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.629
And everything the fans
have worked for.

11:29.964 --> 11:35.093
And it was like, we've finally arrived,
you know. Like, this is it.

11:35.177 --> 11:36.846
This is what
it's meant to be.

11:36.930 --> 11:41.059
We can show you what we've been envisioning, like,
our entire lives.

11:41.141 --> 11:43.185
Now, think about
your wildest dream.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.605
Like, if I can do anything
this would be it.

11:45.688 --> 11:47.231
That's what's
happening to us.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.986
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

12:07.585 --> 12:09.879
I think I was very anxious
rather than nervous.

12:10.004 --> 12:12.715
Just really anxious to get
on the road and really...

12:12.799 --> 12:14.842
To see how all of these
moving parts

12:14.926 --> 12:16.886
would come together
into this cohesive show.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.220
And I think, you know,

12:18.304 --> 12:21.849
we're so happy with it.
And we're so happy that our fans are coming out.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.060
It's cool to know that the hard work is paying off.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.062
I feel
ten times better today.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.188
I feel better, too.
I was worrying about it all weekend,

12:28.314 --> 12:31.609
but now that we ran it through...
I feel good about it.

12:31.692 --> 12:33.820
We've run it a lot,
the video content is coming together.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.696
- How do you feel about it, Kirstin?
- What?

12:35.780 --> 12:37.657
I feel grand...
about the show.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.157
I just practiced in my heels for the first time.

12:39.283 --> 12:41.368
She's practicing in her heels.
That's what Beyonce does.

12:41.452 --> 12:43.997
And I didn't die.
So that's always promising.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.667
Night before the tour.
This is grind time we call it, you know.

12:47.750 --> 12:51.838
We have quite a bit of work to do.
There won't be much sleeping tonight.

12:58.176 --> 12:59.846
I hate...

13:00.554 --> 13:01.681
It's Bobby McFerrin.

13:01.764 --> 13:02.849
Bobby McFerrin.

13:02.932 --> 13:04.475
- Bobby McFerrin.
- Bobby McFerrin.

13:04.558 --> 13:06.644
I've been trying,
nobody ever laughs when I do it.

13:06.727 --> 13:07.561
You never do it.

13:07.645 --> 13:09.396
Yeah, that's because
you don't deliver it right.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.024
Yeah, you have
to commit to the joke.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.067
What are you doing?

13:13.151 --> 13:14.443
All my vertebrae
just popped.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.945
Wait. I wanna try!

13:16.529 --> 13:17.905
- Let me try it.
- Okay.

13:18.739 --> 13:19.907
It's my turn!

13:19.991 --> 13:21.993
How flat was
my television solo?

13:22.118 --> 13:23.619
Very! Very...

13:23.703 --> 13:25.079
No, was it actually
very flat, though?

13:25.163 --> 13:26.455
I don't remember
actually.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.043
Well, I didn't notice,
so it must have not been terrible. Pick up your phone.

13:30.126 --> 13:31.293
All right, good talk.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.336
What do I do?

13:32.419 --> 13:35.422
You lay it back and then you, like,
roll it on your back.

13:35.589 --> 13:37.215
You're so stupid.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.970
Are you kidding me? Okay.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.805
Now push yourself.
Roll it back.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.850
No, this isn't working.
It doesn't feel good.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.768
You just don't know
how to do it.

13:48.519 --> 13:53.482
Ow! Oh!
Okay, this does nothing for me.

13:53.607 --> 13:55.860
Your first day.
I'm proud of you.

13:56.443 --> 13:59.906
Man, so we have a day before the show.
I feel pretty good.

13:59.989 --> 14:02.992
There's just certain things
that need to be synchronized

14:03.076 --> 14:04.577
and solidified,
but, you know...

14:05.452 --> 14:07.413
It's the last day.
We're gonna make it work.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.331
We always do.
We have an amazing team.

14:09.415 --> 14:12.210
It's gonna be a good time.
It's gonna be a great show, y'all.

14:13.502 --> 14:15.253
Tomorrow's gonna
be crazy. Whoo!

14:17.548 --> 14:19.926
Yeah,
my voice is really tired after the run through.

14:20.051 --> 14:22.136
But, I think,
going through the show would be a good idea.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.764
I feel like it's
also not done, maybe.

14:24.972 --> 14:26.807
It's, like, borderline,
getting sick.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.768
I always get sick.

14:28.976 --> 14:31.896
I don't even do crazy things
to make me sick.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.689
I just...
I'm just delicate.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.570
I just started
taking voice lessons.

14:39.820 --> 14:43.741
So, it's kind of nerve-racking
singing on stage.

14:43.866 --> 14:47.661
Um, I'm not sure how it's gonna go,
but I hope it goes really well.

14:47.745 --> 14:51.331
'Cause, once again,
this is not something I've really done before.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.543
I can't believe
it's finally here.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.295
This is so exciting,
you know.

14:56.420 --> 15:01.175
To finally put all this together that we've been working on for...

15:01.259 --> 15:03.427
I mean, maybe a couple of weeks,
to be completely honest.

15:03.510 --> 15:04.845
So it's a little
nerve-racking.

15:04.929 --> 15:07.014
But I think it's gonna be
an amazing show.

15:10.059 --> 15:12.436
You ready?
I said, you ready?

15:14.105 --> 15:15.522
- What's up?
- Aw.

15:15.606 --> 15:17.024
How you doing?
You take that for me?

15:17.108 --> 15:18.525
Yes. You playing.

15:19.526 --> 15:20.486
Go get your own stuff.

15:20.569 --> 15:21.487
Yo. Yo. Come on, bro.

15:22.029 --> 15:23.405
Hey, you just
can't do that.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.825
All right. Me too. I'm real excited.
Not like your jacket.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.119
I'm also
a little bit nervous.

15:28.244 --> 15:29.369
I'm not nervous.

15:29.703 --> 15:30.663
That's a good attitude.

15:30.746 --> 15:31.789
That's a good attitude.

15:31.872 --> 15:34.250
I ain't nervous.
I ain't never scared!

15:37.544 --> 15:40.131
First day of tour!

15:44.051 --> 15:45.178
Low on energy.

15:45.303 --> 15:47.763
I need to eat
about five gallons of food.

15:48.889 --> 15:50.641

15:51.058 --> 15:52.392

15:58.858 --> 15:59.984
Can I delete
PTX Volume One

16:00.067 --> 16:02.028
off of our Twitter and put
Grammy Award winning--

16:02.111 --> 16:03.403
Yes.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.007
Well, here we go.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.595
I seriously was like,
"How are we going to do this?

16:29.138 --> 16:31.473
How are we gonna put together this show?
Not just us,

16:31.557 --> 16:34.434
but the entire crew,
the video,

16:34.768 --> 16:36.770
the staging, like,
everything about it,

16:36.854 --> 16:40.482
in, honestly,
like, a week?"

16:41.234 --> 16:42.609
And I'm not even
being dramatic,

16:42.693 --> 16:44.820
like, I just didn't know
how we were going to do it.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.531
It had been a while since we had actually done a full tour.

16:47.614 --> 16:49.449
So, I was eager to
get back in, but

16:49.533 --> 16:52.203
we had such a limited
amount of time.

16:54.038 --> 16:56.332
I mean,
there are a lot of details that go into it.

16:56.415 --> 16:59.001
So, we were a little
stressed about that.

16:59.501 --> 17:00.878
After your sound check,

17:00.961 --> 17:03.505
just give me ten minutes with you guys and we'll figure that out.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.384
I like your...
Your cardigan thing is sick.

17:07.218 --> 17:08.301
Let's do it.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.723
You're talking business
and I'm talking cardigans.

17:14.683 --> 17:16.435
At the end of the day,

17:17.310 --> 17:20.106
no matter what happens with this group, like,
we always get it done.

17:20.189 --> 17:21.565
I don't know
how we do it.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.318
We always get it done,
I genuinely don't know.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.535
I mean, you just...

17:33.619 --> 17:37.497
You don't want it, like, slick or shiny,
but just, kind of, create a hold?

17:37.664 --> 17:39.541
Yeah, yeah,
just to create a hold.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.127
Yeah, and...

17:41.543 --> 17:44.338
We can do that, like,
I would say, you know...

17:45.423 --> 17:46.548
I literally have never
been hungrier.

17:46.673 --> 17:47.674
I know.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.843
It's like you just
got off the island.

17:49.927 --> 17:51.137
That's how I feel.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.972
Yeah, I feel like
I'm on the show Survivor.

17:53.389 --> 17:54.723
Avi versus carrot.

17:54.848 --> 17:57.768
Like, real gross.
Literally, leave this out of the documentary.

17:59.353 --> 18:01.521
And there is catering
with, like, fish and steak.

18:02.356 --> 18:03.232
Hmm?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.233
Yeah. I think so.

18:04.942 --> 18:06.485
They have steak
out there now?

18:06.693 --> 18:08.404
What the freak
am I eating vegetables for?

18:09.029 --> 18:10.614
Time for VIP, y'all.

18:13.242 --> 18:14.618
Let's go.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.078
Don't talk
to me that way.

18:16.954 --> 18:18.872
So, we're heading to the VIP
meet and greet right now.

18:18.956 --> 18:20.040
Our first one on tour.

18:20.124 --> 18:22.709
Our first one ever on tour.
I'm really excited.

18:22.793 --> 18:24.795
The fans seem really nice,
they were at sound check

18:24.878 --> 18:25.838
and they were so sweet.

18:25.921 --> 18:26.880
They gave us cupcakes.

18:26.964 --> 18:28.966
Like six of them
had Scomiche shirts on.

18:29.049 --> 18:30.509
Nobody is coming
with us.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.927
Whatever.

18:32.136 --> 18:34.554
- I want it to be in there.
- We'll entertain the masses.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.142
Oh, my God!
He was eating a chocolate banana.

18:38.225 --> 18:39.226
I want
a chocolate banana.

18:39.310 --> 18:40.269
Me too.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.356
Fast feet, fast feet,
Fast feet, fast feet!

18:43.856 --> 18:47.443
What I love about our fans is that it's three generations of people.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.987
I love when we meet people
and they're like,

18:50.070 --> 18:51.655
"Thank you so much.
I can finally go

18:51.738 --> 18:53.907
to a concert and enjoy this music with my daughter."

18:53.991 --> 18:55.409

a family event.

The coolest thing about being on the road is that

you get to see
all these people

19:40.954 --> 19:44.542
that have supported you
from the beginning.

19:44.624 --> 19:49.046
So, you're putting a face
to this number that you see.

19:49.171 --> 19:52.007
You know, you see...
For Daft Punk you see 100 million views.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.134
But now you're finally
personalizing it

19:54.218 --> 19:57.221
by meeting the people
that was one of those views.

19:57.304 --> 19:59.390
You know,
that's so cool to me.

Thanks, guys.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.033
Thank you, guys.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.578
See,
the difference between everybody else and me is that

20:20.660 --> 20:22.788
everybody's super
uber, uber talented.

20:22.913 --> 20:25.374
So I need
to compensate...

20:25.499 --> 20:28.627
and practice.

20:29.295 --> 20:33.840
If I had the talent they had I would never practice in my life.

20:47.354 --> 20:48.522
What time is it?

20:48.606 --> 20:49.940
Shit, dude. It's 8:07.

20:50.023 --> 20:53.860
That's not exciting.
That's not exciting. Not exciting.

20:56.113 --> 20:56.947
What's up?

21:02.453 --> 21:05.414
Dude, should I wear another white shirt or do you like it creeping out?

21:05.498 --> 21:07.082
What else would you wear?
Just nothing?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.792
A black one or nothing.

21:09.251 --> 21:11.044
I mean, I kinda like
the white actually,

21:11.128 --> 21:13.589
'cause then it makes
the inside color pop more.

21:13.631 --> 21:17.426
Yeah, that's really cool.
The crowd's really loud and excited.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.052
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, you look great.

21:19.136 --> 21:21.347
Cool. Sister approval, that's all I need.

21:22.348 --> 21:25.225
I'm nervous. Oh, my God.
It's becoming real.

21:27.436 --> 21:29.855
I'm, like,
nervous if I'll forget the words and I'm just standing by.

21:29.938 --> 21:31.482
I know. Words are scary.

21:31.815 --> 21:33.066
Oh, well.
If I forget the words,

21:33.150 --> 21:35.361
I'll be like, "Well,
I changed them on the spot."

21:35.444 --> 21:36.945
I wrote 'em,
so whatever.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.450
I feel like
I'm gonna trip.

21:41.575 --> 21:42.742
That's what
I'm scared about.

21:42.826 --> 21:45.663
Oh, my God, yeah.
You're gonna be walking through a crowd.

21:45.912 --> 21:47.540
It's hard
to look this good, dude.

21:51.126 --> 21:53.962
We need...
Or even a safety pin. Something.

21:55.088 --> 21:56.507
You want
this collar down?

21:56.756 --> 21:57.924
No.

21:58.509 --> 21:59.718
You sure?

22:02.721 --> 22:05.265
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

22:08.644 --> 22:10.729
- Is this see through. My Pentatonix?
- Not really.

22:10.812 --> 22:13.815
You can see the bum,
but that's 'cause I've got big bulging pecs.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.401
You can't hide those.

22:15.484 --> 22:16.652
You look cool.

22:16.735 --> 22:17.736
Thanks, buddy.

22:18.278 --> 22:19.738
- You ready?
- Yeah.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.532
Shut your eyes.

22:23.367 --> 22:26.078
Can you... I was, like,
how are the artists feeling?

22:26.953 --> 22:30.790
PTX! PTX!
Grammy! Grammy!

22:31.749 --> 22:34.503
They're chanting "Grammy."
That's so cute.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.713
- Wow!
- What are they saying?

22:35.795 --> 22:37.464
- Grammy.
- That's sweet.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.051
Well, we're all here.
How do you guys feel?

22:45.556 --> 22:49.184
PTX! PTX! PTX!

22:52.438 --> 22:53.606
Father God,
thank you so much

22:53.731 --> 22:57.025
for this absolutely amazing opportunity to bless all these people out here.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.944
Um, you brought us so far

22:59.027 --> 23:01.779
with Grammys and
problems selling albums

23:01.863 --> 23:02.989
and now, Lord,
we get to do

23:03.073 --> 23:05.242
what we love to do, which is
to perform for people.

23:05.325 --> 23:08.120
Be in this space,
may the Holy Spirit be amongst us

23:08.203 --> 23:10.830
and let's just do the best that we can with your grace with us.

23:10.914 --> 23:12.458

- Amen.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.375
Amen.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.669

26:35.828 --> 26:38.204
We wanna tell you guys
a little story.

26:38.705 --> 26:43.919
This story starts, in Arlington, Texas,
with three little baby singers.

26:45.002 --> 26:48.047
Look at 'em.
So beautiful.

26:48.715 --> 26:51.008
I actually met Mitch in community theater

26:51.092 --> 26:52.636
when we were about, like,
ten years old.

26:52.719 --> 26:55.889
And did a lot of shows together.
But I didn't meet Scott until high school.

26:55.973 --> 27:01.394
Right away Scott and I had this really,
really close hilarious bond.

27:01.478 --> 27:02.980
We just thought
we were so funny

27:03.062 --> 27:05.398
and we really appreciated
each other's talents as well.

27:05.482 --> 27:08.401
When we started a trio a capella group back in high school,

27:08.485 --> 27:10.027
performed at our
spring concert.

27:10.153 --> 27:12.029
And someone filmed it
and put it on YouTube

27:12.113 --> 27:15.784
and that was our first
experience with like, virality.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.746
We were like,
"Maybe this actually could be something."

27:19.830 --> 27:23.040
And I think that's why Scott was so inspired to do The Sing Off.

27:23.124 --> 27:25.836
So, I joined an a capella group in college.

27:25.919 --> 27:27.713
And a lot of them had been
on The Sing Off before,

27:27.838 --> 27:29.422
so they're like,
"You should try out."

27:29.506 --> 27:31.675
Scott contacted us
and then he was like,

27:31.758 --> 27:34.302
"Hey, have you ever heard of the show called The SingOff?"

27:34.386 --> 27:35.387
And I actually had.

27:35.470 --> 27:37.890
When Scott approached me about the audition for The SingOff,

27:37.973 --> 27:40.392
I was a little... A little wary
because it was something

27:40.517 --> 27:42.268
that was totally outside of
my comfort zone.

27:42.394 --> 27:46.105
I mean, just leaving Arlington,
Texas alone was really scary to me.

27:46.189 --> 27:49.401
But I had big dreams and I didn't really wanna waste this opportunity.

27:49.484 --> 27:51.319
I thought it could be really
something special.

27:51.403 --> 27:55.323
I met Ben Bram in the SoCal Vocals.
When I was putting the group together.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.742
I knew I wanted
him involved.

27:56.825 --> 28:00.746
I saw that video of them doing "Telephone" before I even met Scott.

28:00.829 --> 28:02.414
I was already
thinking about, like,

28:02.497 --> 28:04.374
he should definitely
audition for The Sing Off.

28:04.457 --> 28:05.876
So I talked to him
about the group,

28:05.959 --> 28:08.127
he was like, "Man, you need
a bass and a beat-boxer.

28:08.211 --> 28:10.756
And I already have the bass for you.
His name is Avi Kaplan."

28:11.130 --> 28:15.052
So, Ben Bram, we just happened
to go to the same rehearsal,

28:15.218 --> 28:17.054
ended up singing together
a little bit

28:17.178 --> 28:19.264
and so he sent me
the video of the trio.

28:19.514 --> 28:23.268
And it was so crazy because my friend had just shown me that video,

28:23.351 --> 28:27.480
like, three or four months ago.
And I was like, "Oh, those kids are amazing.

28:27.564 --> 28:30.776
Like, I would love to sing with them.
They're so talented, I love their style."

28:30.859 --> 28:34.613
And he sends me this video and I'm like, "Yes.
Absolutely. Let's do it."

28:34.696 --> 28:37.407
And then I went to Oregon
for my friend's engagement

28:37.532 --> 28:39.117
and they showed me
this video

28:39.242 --> 28:42.245
of this guy beatboxing and playing the cello.
And it was Kevin.

28:42.328 --> 28:45.290
And I was like, "That's the guy we need.
We need him."

28:45.415 --> 28:48.001
And I called him up and I was like, "Hey,
how's it going?"

28:48.085 --> 28:49.335
He was like, "Hey,
who's this?"

28:49.419 --> 28:53.381
And he said, "Hey, we just saw your video and listen,
we're trying to create a group

28:53.465 --> 28:54.925
for this TV show
called The Sing Off."

28:55.008 --> 28:57.469
So, I said, "Okay, sure."

28:57.552 --> 29:01.723
And it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.475
I was, like, a poor
college student.

29:03.558 --> 29:07.020
So I spent all my money I had to fly Kevin out for this audition.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.564
I split it with Ben Bram.

29:09.689 --> 29:12.525
And it ended up being the best investment of my entire life.

29:12.651 --> 29:16.571
I think we were all uncertain to
how it would all come together.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.741
It was so many... It was
completely different people,

29:19.825 --> 29:22.744
completely different places and in different walks of their life.

29:22.911 --> 29:25.330
So we were like,
"Oh, man, I really hope

29:25.413 --> 29:27.206
that everyone gets along
and this really clicks

29:27.290 --> 29:29.001
because it could be
a total disaster."

29:29.084 --> 29:31.544
The six of us met up the day before the audition.

29:31.628 --> 29:33.797
And we sang for the first time,
we sang "Telephone".

29:33.880 --> 29:36.382
And it was just so magical.

29:36.466 --> 29:40.012
It sounds, maybe, cliche,
but it was such a moment

29:40.095 --> 29:42.430
that it was like fate
had brought us together.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.851
And in that song I think we really started to believe in our potential.

29:45.976 --> 29:49.104
I...
I... I just knew that we could do it.

29:49.270 --> 29:51.648
I knew that we could be something special and that we could win.

29:51.731 --> 29:52.816
And we did.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.530
2015 has already been the most incredible year ever.

29:58.613 --> 30:00.782
We put out a platinum-selling
Christmas record.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.201
We're on this amazing tour
with you guys.

30:03.284 --> 30:05.954
We won a Grammy,
earlier this year.

30:07.497 --> 30:09.791
So, thank you, guys,
so much.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.126
Absolutely.

30:11.751 --> 30:14.129
Now we don't tell you guys this story just to talk about it.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.049
We tell you guys because we genuinely just want to thank you

30:17.174 --> 30:20.301
so much for all that you guys have done for us.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.554
This would not be possible
without you guys.

30:22.762 --> 30:24.973
So thank you, guys,
so much, truly.

30:25.515 --> 30:27.559
We love you.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.438
I feel like
I could do back-flips!

30:37.069 --> 30:38.528
Whoo!

30:45.869 --> 30:47.079
Cheers!

30:47.162 --> 30:48.663
Cheers to our tour.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.498
To the amazing team
that we have.

30:50.790 --> 30:52.000
Thanks, everyone.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.710
Cheers to everyone here.

30:54.002 --> 30:55.921
No, y'all did that like...

30:56.004 --> 30:57.505
You did it really good.

30:57.589 --> 31:02.928
And all jokes aside,
that was beyond, um, perfect.

31:04.303 --> 31:05.638
Kevin!

31:05.847 --> 31:08.141
Oh, my God, guys.
It was better than I ever expected.

31:08.225 --> 31:09.308
Yeah. Yeah.

31:09.392 --> 31:11.103
From rehearsal to tonight,
night and day.

31:11.186 --> 31:14.814
Overall the show was just like
great. People loved it.

31:14.898 --> 31:17.483
Like a total a capella snob
who hates everything,

31:17.567 --> 31:18.944
if they came, would they
have had a good time?

31:19.027 --> 31:20.445
- Yes. Totally.
- Okay, good.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.239
Every moment that you were
doing so good,

31:22.321 --> 31:24.657
you would do it
and it would be like...

31:26.618 --> 31:28.203
Yay! Thanks, guys.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.124
Daddy, I missed you!

31:32.207 --> 31:33.583
- I missed you too.
- Where have you been?

31:33.666 --> 31:37.087
I can't go 30 seconds
without you by my side.

31:37.170 --> 31:38.255

31:38.463 --> 31:39.547

31:39.631 --> 31:42.008
Yes! Thank you.

31:42.092 --> 31:43.093
Helmut Lang.

31:43.176 --> 31:45.262
Ugh. You rock Helmut Lang.

31:45.344 --> 31:46.345
Thank you.

31:46.846 --> 31:49.099
You guys are lightweights,
that's because you're so skinny.

31:49.182 --> 31:50.850
Ugh!

31:50.976 --> 31:52.351
Everyone tells us that.

31:52.435 --> 31:55.147
I know... You're right.
Oh, my God. I just noticed that.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.149
It's super. It's probably
the tenth time today.

31:57.232 --> 31:58.316
It's super weird.
Hello!

31:59.067 --> 32:01.111

Oh, thank God! Great.
That's gonna be the super fruit.

32:07.408 --> 32:10.411

but he is dead wrong.

32:10.495 --> 32:11.537

Hi, I'm good.
How are you?

32:53.997 --> 32:57.334
Good.
I just wanted to give you a call and let you know

32:57.416 --> 32:59.377
that the doctor's gonna

33:00.045 --> 33:01.087

No problem.
Talk to you later.

33:02.463 --> 33:03.882
- Feel better, Kirstie.
- Bye.

33:04.590 --> 33:07.677
The hardest part about being on tour is definitely staying healthy.

33:07.802 --> 33:09.971
For us, our instrument
is our body.

33:10.055 --> 33:14.142
So when we get sick,
we can't do the show to our fullest potential.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.062
And we don't have any tracks or anything behind us to back us up.

33:17.187 --> 33:20.357
And so, when one of us gets sick,
the show really, really suffers.

33:20.815 --> 33:23.360
And so that is nerve-wracking,
and tough.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.778
And I'm somehow always sick.
And it's really sad.

33:26.363 --> 33:28.740
I think it made me
a little bit more professional

33:28.865 --> 33:30.658
in being, like,
"I have to be well

33:30.742 --> 33:32.827
because I wanna do my job
and I wanna kill it."

33:33.161 --> 33:35.997
And, um,
that's kinda the mentality that I took over.

33:36.122 --> 33:38.541
I feel like, you know, that
like, warm sickly feeling

33:38.624 --> 33:40.459
- like, when you're lightheaded.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:40.543 --> 33:42.128
I feel that, too.
So, it's not just like,

33:42.212 --> 33:43.671
"I'm really dried out."

33:43.880 --> 33:45.382
- Right.
- I just, like, feel bad.

I'm so excited.

34:12.409 --> 34:13.784
We're, literally,
her biggest fans.

34:13.868 --> 34:15.703
And she tweeted us,
and we freaked out.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.205
- She did?
- She did tweet us all.

34:17.330 --> 34:20.625
Oh, my gosh.
And she made this video announcing the tour

34:20.750 --> 34:23.628
and a majority of the video
she's just talking about us.

34:23.710 --> 34:25.588
She loves us.
It was so really nice.

34:25.670 --> 34:29.007
All she had to say was I'm going on tour with Pentatonix,
but she, like, went on.

34:29.092 --> 34:30.260
Went on to be like...

34:30.342 --> 34:31.469

34:35.639 --> 34:40.437
and now today we're doing not only a show,
but we're recording a song. So...

34:40.518 --> 34:42.981
And before yesterday,
we had a show till late, so...

34:43.063 --> 34:47.235
we're working on about six hours of sleep total in the last three days.

34:49.612 --> 34:51.739
Um, how'd you make
that song?

34:51.822 --> 34:54.033
I'm just so impressed of you.

34:54.199 --> 34:59.789
You have the best voice because your...
You make the song.

34:59.914 --> 35:01.458
I'm like, "Whoa!"

35:01.540 --> 35:07.505
That is totally out of my...
world

35:08.047 --> 35:11.509
And I really think

35:11.592 --> 35:15.513
you guys are the best band
I've ever seen.

35:15.596 --> 35:16.722
Thank you.

35:16.806 --> 35:18.475
Thank you so much. I appreciate you.

35:20.477 --> 35:23.396
Wow, I almost cried,
I'll be honest.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.315
What? Are we about
to go on stage?

35:25.564 --> 35:27.566
Yeah, you know
what we got here?

35:27.650 --> 35:29.486
We got some strong defense!

35:29.568 --> 35:31.237
That's what we got.

35:31.321 --> 35:33.739
And then we're gonna have
Avi come in on stage left

35:33.823 --> 35:36.242
- and be like... "Doh!"
- Yes!

35:36.409 --> 35:38.619
And then Kevin's gonna
come in on stage right!

35:38.703 --> 35:40.621
- He's gonna be like...
- Yes!]

35:40.705 --> 35:41.914
And then Scott's gonna come

35:41.998 --> 35:44.917
down the middle of the court,
he's gonna be like, "Ooh!"

35:50.673 --> 35:51.716
Hey!

35:52.509 --> 35:53.718
Forum, Utah.

35:55.845 --> 35:57.180
Jazz hands.

36:04.187 --> 36:09.442
Um, I feel fine. I just need to, like,
actually have a rest day tomorrow.

36:09.526 --> 36:15.407
But I... I have positive energy...
to get through the night.

36:15.490 --> 36:17.158
That's all that matters.

36:22.872 --> 36:24.123
You guys are amazing.

36:25.542 --> 36:26.667
Thank you.

36:27.544 --> 36:31.672
Okay, so this is the first tour that we've ever performed this next song.

36:32.549 --> 36:34.842
But it's one of the first songs
we ever recorded.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.262
And it's called "Love You Long
Time." From PTX, Vol. 1.

36:37.345 --> 36:39.347
Okay, good, you know it.

36:40.181 --> 36:43.142

38:34.712 --> 38:36.422
Can you believe we get
to do this for a living?

38:36.506 --> 38:37.465
I can't.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.466
It's very unbelievable.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.009
Kirstie,
how are you feeling?

38:41.010 --> 38:42.387
No, okay.

38:44.847 --> 38:47.016
All right, I'll see you guys.
I'm gonna go record.

38:53.272 --> 38:58.653
Working on the album, on tour,
I will not say that it is easy.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.573
Okay, we know exactly
what we have to do right?

39:01.822 --> 39:02.907
Yes, we do.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.326
Because
in the past, usually,

39:05.868 --> 39:12.375
you just focused on the show,
but this one... pretty much always work.

39:12.458 --> 39:16.087
Tomorrow we want to start
on the song called "Rose Gold."

39:16.170 --> 39:18.047
- And so...
- Recording it?

39:18.130 --> 39:19.840
Uh, no.
Arranging it.

39:19.924 --> 39:24.011
The toughest thing about doing a capella original music,

39:24.095 --> 39:27.599
is not a lot of a capella has
played on the radio before.

39:27.682 --> 39:31.269
And the radio, like,
requires kind of a specific sound to play a song.

39:31.352 --> 39:34.355
And so,
crafting an arrangement that could play on the radio,

39:34.480 --> 39:38.943
but holding the integrity of a capella,
is... Has been a task.

39:39.026 --> 39:42.947
As you're getting ready to release an album of mostly originals,

39:43.030 --> 39:45.157
what sort of things
do you think about?

39:45.241 --> 39:47.868
We have a really cool system
because we're all so different.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.121
If it can get past
all five of us,

39:50.288 --> 39:52.707
I feel like a lot of people
are gonna want it.

39:52.790 --> 39:55.293
Because if it gets past all five of us,
it's gonna be...

39:55.585 --> 39:57.002
the best possible product.

39:57.211 --> 39:59.589
Because we're all super picky
for different reasons.

40:00.506 --> 40:03.342
The priority for us as a band
is to not lose integrity, too.

40:03.426 --> 40:06.596
Because it's just so easy for people to be like, well,
why don't you add this?

40:06.679 --> 40:11.016
If you just add the piano like this,
it'll change so much...

40:11.434 --> 40:12.727
No, what brought us so far

40:12.810 --> 40:15.563
and what people love about us is the fact that it is a capella.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.650
I think the success that we've had has really validated all those things.

40:18.733 --> 40:21.902
'Cause, you know, I mean,
to have a Grammy, which is so weird still

40:21.986 --> 40:24.196
and so surreal and, you know,
platinum Christmas album,

40:24.280 --> 40:26.907
it gave us the confidence to say no,
we're in the right direction.

40:27.032 --> 40:28.284
Should I do like a...

40:31.120 --> 40:32.163
Like a really long...

40:32.246 --> 40:33.289
Just as like a sample?

40:33.372 --> 40:34.582
- Yeah.
- Sure.

40:35.082 --> 40:36.292
Can I hear
the chorus though?

40:36.375 --> 40:40.672
♪ ...we could be stars
We could be rose gold ♪

40:41.464 --> 40:44.049
♪ Rose gold ♪

40:44.383 --> 40:45.343
That's it, right?

40:45.510 --> 40:46.469
Yeah.

40:48.262 --> 40:51.599
Pretty good.
It's supposed to go from one to three and we end at 1:10.

40:51.766 --> 40:52.975
I like that.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.646
Cool, let's just
come out and...

40:56.771 --> 40:58.314
Oh, with the beginning.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.777
I wanna get some soup.
That sounds good.

41:03.402 --> 41:06.238
We're gonna go to Vail Village,
the main village.

41:06.322 --> 41:10.785
Vail Village! Where all
your dreams comes true!

41:12.203 --> 41:13.538
Thank you.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.414
Holy moly!

41:15.498 --> 41:16.541
Wow!

41:18.250 --> 41:19.335
There's a Starbucks.

41:19.918 --> 41:21.713
All right, let's find
the best soup in town.

41:22.087 --> 41:23.964
I want something
really special.

41:24.256 --> 41:25.717
Here we are.

41:32.139 --> 41:33.432
Look at this vine.

41:37.436 --> 41:39.063
All right, let's start
from the beginning.

41:39.313 --> 41:40.272
How did he do that?

41:40.356 --> 41:41.315
Oh, nice.

41:45.695 --> 41:47.321
- Wait, they're at our concert?
- Yeah.

41:47.446 --> 41:48.656
Wait, that's cool.

41:51.450 --> 41:52.827
And they got the same key
and everything.

41:52.910 --> 41:53.952
I know.

41:54.036 --> 41:54.912
That was really good.

41:54.995 --> 41:55.913
That's smart of them.

41:55.996 --> 41:57.623
They could not have nailed
the timing better.

41:57.707 --> 41:58.833
That's great.

42:08.885 --> 42:10.469
Thank you so much.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.432
I... am so excited.

42:14.515 --> 42:15.641
You're really gonna like it.

42:15.725 --> 42:17.602
This is exactly
what I wanna do.

42:17.685 --> 42:19.395
- Good.
- One hundred percent.

42:19.562 --> 42:21.021
We've really nailed it.

42:32.408 --> 42:34.368
Oh, we were supposed to be
in the lobby at 3:50.

42:34.452 --> 42:35.536
- We were?
- Yeah.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.037
- Not four?
- No.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.122
All right,
see you guys there.

42:38.205 --> 42:39.123
Sorry about that.

42:39.206 --> 42:40.040
I just realized...

42:40.124 --> 42:41.542
- Productive...
- Productive day.

42:45.546 --> 42:47.882
Um, so we're at
an ENT in Omaha

42:48.466 --> 42:51.886
Um, they're gonna scope me and check
out and make sure everything is okay.

42:52.136 --> 42:56.265
And hopefully give me the right
medications so I can get better.

42:56.474 --> 42:57.642
So...

42:58.225 --> 43:01.896
All right, well,
let me tell you that I caught your act

43:02.020 --> 43:03.731
- and I was pretty impressed.
- Thank you.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.399
- So, that's awesome.
- Thank you so much.

43:05.483 --> 43:06.400
This is what you do
professionally.

43:06.484 --> 43:07.359
Mmm-hmm.

43:07.485 --> 43:10.696
This is what you do even if you have this much loss.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.239
- That's a big deal.
- Yeah.

43:24.752 --> 43:25.962
All right, enough.

43:26.044 --> 43:27.379
Okay, we'll stop there.

43:27.755 --> 43:29.966
I've been sleeping and drinking water and not talking to anyone.

43:30.048 --> 43:31.216
- Good.
- And so...

43:31.300 --> 43:32.259
Good.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.302
That's all I can do really.

43:33.385 --> 43:34.637
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

43:54.156 --> 43:55.950
Oh, baby.

44:27.606 --> 44:30.192
- How's it going?
- What do you got in your hand there?

44:30.401 --> 44:32.570
An apple. Healthy snack
after the show.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.489
What can we say about that?

44:36.824 --> 44:38.450
But you know what's behind you though, right?

44:38.993 --> 44:40.202
Mmm-hmm.

44:42.747 --> 44:44.164
Chicago's classic.

44:45.041 --> 44:46.918
Are you freaking
kidding me?

44:55.467 --> 44:57.762
Just joking. I'll pick up the apple!
I was joking.

44:58.846 --> 45:00.180
And now the apple.

45:00.890 --> 45:02.307
Hey, but did you get
the apple drop?

45:02.391 --> 45:03.893
- No.
- No!

45:13.402 --> 45:16.072
You guys seem to have a really great vibe together.

45:16.196 --> 45:17.322
And I meet a lot of groups,

45:17.406 --> 45:19.742
and, trust me, I can honestly
tell you not every group

45:19.825 --> 45:22.118
is as friendly or talkative
as you guys are.

45:22.286 --> 45:24.538
But touring with the same people day in and day out is difficult.

45:24.622 --> 45:27.499
It wears on you whether you guys are saints or sinners.

45:27.583 --> 45:30.753
So what keeps you guys focused and
what keeps you going down the path

45:30.836 --> 45:33.547
that you know that this is
what you want to keep doing?

45:33.631 --> 45:35.007
I think our work ethic.
Yeah.

45:35.091 --> 45:37.009
We've developed
such a strong work ethic

45:37.093 --> 45:40.220
and we have about 900 things
on our queue of stuff to do.

45:40.304 --> 45:43.099
And so, I mean, you know,
we bicker like a family,

45:43.181 --> 45:45.517
but there's just...
We're just so focused on the future...

45:45.643 --> 45:48.062
What we wanna achieve
in the bigger picture, um...

45:49.021 --> 45:50.564
And we know that what we're doing,

45:50.648 --> 45:52.691
this is very unique
in this industry, very unique.

45:52.775 --> 45:55.319
So, it's kind of, like,
we have an opportunity

45:55.402 --> 45:56.946
to do something
pretty amazing.

45:57.029 --> 45:58.489
You know,
a little birdie told me

45:58.572 --> 46:01.993
that you guys are feverishly working away on your next album.

46:02.076 --> 46:05.496
So how much of that next album is gonna be you guys?

46:05.579 --> 46:06.831
Basically all of it.

46:06.914 --> 46:08.373
All the album
will be originals.

46:08.457 --> 46:11.127
We're at the point in our careers now,
we must go to original music.

46:11.209 --> 46:13.587
And we want to go to original music,
we have so much to say.

46:13.671 --> 46:16.340
And I think it's gonna be
quite a journey.

46:16.423 --> 46:17.549
Yes.

46:17.716 --> 46:19.593
Maybe Kevin's in falsetto.
Maybe he's higher.

46:19.677 --> 46:21.971
Maybe it's...
together.

46:34.900 --> 46:37.319
I'm not doing that one.

46:38.194 --> 46:40.823
I like the idea of kind of like,
changing the melody, like...

46:46.328 --> 46:49.123
Yeah, I like referencing
the verse.

46:51.959 --> 46:53.377
Should we end with that?

46:54.503 --> 46:56.296
Oh, what if...

46:56.672 --> 46:59.550
What if you keep saying "good night" and we all go to...

46:59.633 --> 47:01.259
♪ Good night ♪

47:02.720 --> 47:04.471
Ooh, that's pretty.

47:04.596 --> 47:05.764
Nice, I love it.

47:06.473 --> 47:10.728
Before we let you go,
I think your label has something they would like to...

47:10.936 --> 47:12.063
Label.

47:12.146 --> 47:13.271
...give you.

47:13.522 --> 47:15.566
Oh, in the name
of all things...

47:15.649 --> 47:17.026
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

47:17.109 --> 47:18.194
No way!

47:18.276 --> 47:19.444
Damn, that's cool!

47:19.528 --> 47:21.237
Oh, my God!

47:21.488 --> 47:23.490
That is so cool.

47:23.824 --> 47:25.034
That is super nice.

47:25.117 --> 47:27.078
That is so awesome!

47:27.161 --> 47:29.121
Oh, my God!

47:29.245 --> 47:31.749
Isn't it like really, really
hard to go gold in Canada?

47:31.874 --> 47:34.043
Uh, yeah.
It really is.

47:34.126 --> 47:35.377
- Wow!
- Thank you, guys.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.713
Actually, truth be told,
we were a whisker from platinum.

47:37.796 --> 47:38.964
Really?

47:39.048 --> 47:40.216
But ran out of weeks
before Christmas.

47:40.298 --> 47:41.800
- Aw.
- Next year though.

47:41.884 --> 47:44.845
The end of this year we'll be platinum and we'll be able to do this again.

47:44.929 --> 47:46.013
That's so amazing.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.056
God!

47:47.389 --> 47:49.016
You know, we're halfway
through the tour.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.392
We are halfway
through the tour.

47:50.475 --> 47:52.394
- This is the halfway point?
- Wow!

47:52.853 --> 47:55.731
I feel good about it, but I am getting tired,
but it's been really fun.

47:55.814 --> 47:57.066
It's been really fun.

47:57.191 --> 47:59.151
And actually,
it took me a good two minutes--

47:59.235 --> 48:00.402
Hi.

48:01.653 --> 48:03.781
You're always
getting me eating.

48:04.531 --> 48:06.951
I'm about to
shoot some hoop.

48:07.034 --> 48:08.994
I'm about to
do a sweet ally.

48:09.494 --> 48:10.788
Let's not hurt someone.

48:11.538 --> 48:12.998
Yay!

48:13.289 --> 48:15.167
Yay, homie,
you got it.

48:15.960 --> 48:18.170
Miami Heat.
Do they play basketball?

48:19.630 --> 48:23.259
God, you're so good.
Thank you for this food. Here I go.

48:25.844 --> 48:26.929
Mmm-hmm.

48:38.774 --> 48:40.109
Oh, you got a salad?

48:44.905 --> 48:46.991
Before it was like,
you know,

48:47.866 --> 48:50.911
show day, or not show day,
we don't really have anything to do.

48:51.036 --> 48:54.248
We're just chilling.
Sleeping till three. It's like whatever.

48:54.330 --> 48:57.584
But now, we're like
arranging everything.

48:57.751 --> 49:02.298
And writing, and recording.
And like, every single day.

49:02.380 --> 49:04.258
Days off, are not
days off anymore.

49:04.424 --> 49:07.970
They're work days.
They're just days when we don't have a shower, you know.

49:08.262 --> 49:11.140
I just think fans, like,
when they like something,

49:11.223 --> 49:12.766
like, they always want that.

49:12.850 --> 49:15.769
And so they go like,
"Why aren't you guys doing like live videos anymore?

49:15.853 --> 49:17.938
Like, we miss those.
Like those are like more intimate.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.231
Those are like
more you guys."

49:19.315 --> 49:20.983
But we don't have the time,
you know.

49:21.108 --> 49:24.360
So... But I think
if they see that.

49:24.486 --> 49:27.781
Like, if we show what we're doing while we're not doing that other stuff.

49:27.906 --> 49:31.576
"Oh, that's why they're not
going to see the Eiffel Tower.

49:31.660 --> 49:35.747
They're not out anywhere.
They're working on this album stuff for us, you know."

49:36.207 --> 49:37.916
I think that'd be really good
to show them.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.501
- You guys are ready?
- Yeah.

49:39.584 --> 49:40.836
- Do you have your ears in?
- No.

49:40.919 --> 49:43.047
Atlantic City,
how you doing tonight?

49:47.926 --> 49:49.803
That's what
I'm talking about.

50:01.106 --> 50:02.607
Hey, my collapses
are getting lesser.

50:02.691 --> 50:04.235
Last time I looked
it was like...

50:05.110 --> 50:06.444
Like, on the floor.

50:12.450 --> 50:13.660
No!

50:15.204 --> 50:17.206
No improvement.

50:27.758 --> 50:31.220
Live stream days.
First live stream.

50:31.303 --> 50:33.597
Everyone like, "God. God."

50:34.598 --> 50:35.682
Just letting
you guys know,

50:35.766 --> 50:37.893
like, the band,
if you guys wanna tweet,

50:37.976 --> 50:40.687
the trend is

50:41.397 --> 50:43.439
Let's get that
worldwide trend, baby!

50:43.565 --> 50:44.775
We just kinda
can't start late

50:44.858 --> 50:47.027
'cause there's a live shoot.
Everyone's already watching right now.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.528
- Gotta send you guys right on stage.
- All right.

50:48.612 --> 50:49.571
Just so you know...

50:49.654 --> 50:50.655
Come on.

50:57.453 --> 51:00.249
Live in
ten, nine, eight,

51:00.791 --> 51:04.169
seven, six, five, four,

51:04.460 --> 51:07.256
three, two, one.

51:07.381 --> 51:09.007
Live Dallas.

51:33.949 --> 51:35.409
Are you streaming right now?

51:35.491 --> 51:37.744
Yeah. We're trending
number 1 worldwide.

51:37.828 --> 51:39.163
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:39.246 --> 51:40.331
- PTX@YahooLive is?
- Yeah.

51:40.456 --> 51:41.748
Slay.

51:41.957 --> 51:43.208
That's really cool.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.461
It looks great.
Camera guys are killing it.

52:01.935 --> 52:04.396
So we had this idea where we wanted to surprise Mario

52:04.480 --> 52:07.483
and have him open for us
at our Boston gig.

52:07.565 --> 52:09.609
And so we're making him
a flier as a surprise.

52:09.734 --> 52:10.986
He's gonna freak out.

52:11.069 --> 52:12.321
I'm so excited
for him.

52:13.571 --> 52:14.906
What does that mean?

52:14.990 --> 52:17.117
It means you open for us
at Agganis in Boston!

52:17.201 --> 52:18.534
You're gonna be
our opening act.

52:18.618 --> 52:19.828
Are you serious?

52:19.911 --> 52:21.246
Yes.

52:22.373 --> 52:23.499
What?

52:23.581 --> 52:26.251
Yeah, we already talked to your mom and dad.
We're flying them out.

52:26.335 --> 52:28.462
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

52:36.178 --> 52:38.972
Whoop.
Let's hear this.

52:49.107 --> 52:50.608
Whoa!

52:51.609 --> 52:54.405
Oh, my gosh.

52:56.907 --> 52:58.283
That's really cool.

52:59.575 --> 53:00.994
Hello, everyone.

53:03.163 --> 53:05.249
I'm excited.
I'm nervous.

53:05.374 --> 53:09.169
I'm excited.
I'm all of the things.

53:09.378 --> 53:12.214
I'm gonna go on tonight,
right at 8:00.

53:13.340 --> 53:14.799
I'm gonna sing.

53:16.301 --> 53:18.011
In a sold out arena.

53:19.679 --> 53:22.516
It's like 7300...
7200, 7300.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.184
Pretty crazy.

53:24.726 --> 53:26.978
Hello, my name is Avi,
is anyone...

53:27.062 --> 53:28.897
Hi, I'm Avi,
is anyone naked?

53:31.316 --> 53:33.110
- Dominic, I love you.
- I love you.

53:33.818 --> 53:37.489
I like him a lot.
He's a really good guy and a great singer.

53:38.865 --> 53:40.409
Sings like
a freaking angel.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.036
Cool, shall we walk?

53:43.120 --> 53:44.538
Yeah, probably.

53:45.581 --> 53:47.749
Okay. Here we go.

53:47.832 --> 53:49.084
Are you excited?

53:49.167 --> 53:50.377
I'm so excited.

53:50.461 --> 53:51.503
Oh, my gosh.

53:51.711 --> 53:56.049
Kill it. I'll be watching!
Love you. Of course.

54:00.762 --> 54:01.721
Good luck, Mario!

54:01.805 --> 54:02.931
Thanks, James.

54:04.015 --> 54:05.142
Go kill it!

54:05.267 --> 54:07.852
Thanks, Kirstie.
Love you.

54:08.270 --> 54:09.605
All right? You ready?

54:10.188 --> 54:11.398
Have a great show.

54:11.482 --> 54:12.690
All right.
Thank you, guys.

54:25.036 --> 54:27.080

The interesting thing,
I think, about this is that...

59:50.612 --> 59:52.322
You know, we won
a TV show

59:52.405 --> 59:54.866
where it's, you know,
a capella pitted against a capella,

59:54.950 --> 59:58.119
but now it's this kind of
this small genre

59:58.202 --> 01:00:01.665
where I guess the small things that we do,
competing against the world, if you will.

01:00:01.748 --> 01:00:02.999
That's what
we're doing now.

01:00:03.082 --> 01:00:06.753
And it's a lot more...
It's a lot more daunting.

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.880
Because this is
like real life, you know.

01:00:08.964 --> 01:00:12.676
Can we make this dream
that has been...

01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:15.386
I mean, in the back of our
minds, like a true reality.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:18.765
That's the competition I think
that really we thrive on now.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:22.853
Okay, everybody listen up.
This is the good part of the gig.

01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:26.022
Oh, shoot.

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:27.691
Which one of you
wants it?

01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:30.443
I'm gonna fight for it.

01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:32.737
When we gave you
the gold plaque last fall,

01:00:32.821 --> 01:00:35.281
it was like, "Okay,
this is a down-payment."

01:00:36.407 --> 01:00:39.577
Platinum record.
And in the business...

01:00:39.661 --> 01:00:42.038
It's kinda interesting.
We don't give enough of these away anymore.

01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:45.458
So this is really...
Probably as special for us as this is for you.

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:48.211
But you guys have
your first platinum album.

01:00:56.427 --> 01:00:58.638
Obviously, one for all of you.

01:00:58.805 --> 01:01:01.098
We just got a platinum plaque
awarded to us from RCA

01:01:01.182 --> 01:01:03.727
and it's literally the best feeling in the world.

01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:12.360
Man, listen, we're having
a private rehearsal.

01:01:12.443 --> 01:01:13.904
You can't be...
You can't be here.

01:01:13.987 --> 01:01:15.739
I'm sorry, man.
You can't be here right now.

01:01:15.822 --> 01:01:17.032
Nah, come in, James.
What's up?

01:01:17.114 --> 01:01:20.618
Yo, yo, yo. Welcome
to our work space.

01:01:20.702 --> 01:01:22.579
Cool. You guys can go ahead
and start with this.

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:24.330

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.934
I was having
a moment in my head

01:02:26.017 --> 01:02:28.185
where I was, like, thinking
about when I'm really old

01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.604
and thinking back
on memories,

01:02:29.729 --> 01:02:34.025
what I'm going to think of like the people
that are cheering at the end of shows.

01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:36.193
I thought that this time,
I was like, "Oh, my God.

01:02:36.277 --> 01:02:37.695
I'm going to remember
this moment."

01:02:37.779 --> 01:02:39.530
I, like, soaked it in
because I was like,

01:02:39.614 --> 01:02:41.950
"When I'm 90 I'm gonna want
to remember this moment."

01:02:42.033 --> 01:02:44.327
I never get deep so I feel awkward saying that.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.370

did think that on stage.

I think have we enough between
those last two takes. Yeah.

01:03:41.634 --> 01:03:44.303
One, two, three and...

01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:52.062
Part of this won't have it,
but the second verse will have it.

01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:54.731
Just... An additional layer.
But like barely... Like...

01:03:57.692 --> 01:04:00.153
Yeah. Subconscious.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.905
In your subconscious.

01:04:03.198 --> 01:04:04.365
Like the cow.

01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:05.616
Is that a cow?

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.036
I don't know. Sea cow.

01:04:08.119 --> 01:04:09.120
Like the sea cow?

01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:10.246
This is a sea cow, right?

01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:12.165
I don't know what
you're referring to.

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:14.209
You know what?
Fine, whatever. 13.

Holy moly.

01:04:20.506 --> 01:04:24.301
I'm trying to watch Beyonce "I'm a Pro" for opening to wake myself up.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.430
But the Internet
won't allow it.

01:04:31.559 --> 01:04:32.602
That's me.

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:33.728

the electric slide. Wait.

Wait. Wait. Hold it.

01:05:40.295 --> 01:05:41.629

Band!

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.893
Hello! We are live...

01:06:36.976 --> 01:06:39.770
...here from
Tulsa, Oklahoma.

01:06:40.646 --> 01:06:42.273
We're just gonna answer
your questions.

01:06:42.357 --> 01:06:45.109
And give you, through the Internet,
hugs and kisses.

01:06:45.193 --> 01:06:46.236
That's true.

01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:49.113
And we have two shows left
of the On My Way Home tour.

01:06:49.197 --> 01:06:51.282
How crazy is that?
It went by so quickly.

01:06:51.366 --> 01:06:52.825
This one went by faster
than any other...

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.451
I agree.

01:06:54.535 --> 01:06:56.287
Probably 'cause the show
is the most fun.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:59.123
What is something you missed
while you were on tour?

01:06:59.456 --> 01:07:00.666
- Cat.
- My dog.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.792
- Friends.
- My home.

01:07:01.876 --> 01:07:03.127
- My pillow.
- Bed.

01:07:03.211 --> 01:07:04.420
- Loved ones.
- My friends.

01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:05.546
Parents.

01:07:06.339 --> 01:07:08.632
The hardest part about being on the road for me,

01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:12.511
just not being able to see

01:07:13.721 --> 01:07:15.765
the people that
I always want to see.

01:07:16.015 --> 01:07:18.142
Oh, it's so hard
to let go.

01:07:19.727 --> 01:07:21.729
But it's always so good
to see you, too.

01:07:22.355 --> 01:07:23.731
When's next
I'll see you guys?

01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:25.858
Probably not for a couple
of months.

01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:30.029
We'll be here
on your birthday.

01:07:31.322 --> 01:07:33.157
He's gonna be in Europe.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.951
Or you'll hear from us.

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.829
I'll see you guys
as soon as possible.

01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:41.291
Bye.

01:07:41.374 --> 01:07:42.333
Be safe.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.626
Okay, I'm leaving now.

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:44.877
Here, I'll take you.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.545
Yeah, that's why
I'm taking you.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:50.007
We put so much
into this band,

01:07:50.258 --> 01:07:54.971
which is a beautiful thing,
but it's also a really tough thing because...

01:07:56.097 --> 01:07:58.474
you don't get to see your friends.
You don't get to see your family.

01:07:58.766 --> 01:08:01.727
I can't even say, "Hey, Mom,
I'm coming home for Hanukkah.

01:08:01.894 --> 01:08:04.605
I'm coming home for Christmas.
I'm coming home for Thanksgiving."

01:08:04.688 --> 01:08:07.900
Like, I can't guarantee her that,
which is, like...

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:17.452
That's a tough thing.

01:08:21.413 --> 01:08:25.292
But, at the end of the day,

01:08:28.421 --> 01:08:30.673
when I go to sleep,

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:37.095
I know that I have
and we all have...

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:39.849
changed people's lives
with music.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.269
And that is why
we were put here.

01:08:43.769 --> 01:08:46.939
And that's why we
continue to do what we do.

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:53.821
"Standing By", it is just...
my message.

01:08:53.988 --> 01:08:58.993
And the group's message
to our friends and family.

01:09:00.328 --> 01:09:04.540
That it doesn't matter where I'm at in the world.
Like, my heart is with you.

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:09.170
And basically the phrase,
"I'm standing by."

01:09:09.337 --> 01:09:12.340
What that means is that
I'm always here,

01:09:12.465 --> 01:09:16.010
but everyone has their own version of that that they struggle with.

01:09:16.093 --> 01:09:18.095
Whether it's someone
that they lost

01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:20.639
or someone that they love that they just can't be with,

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.100
you just...
You're standing by.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:27.770
And so, for me personally,
when I sing that song

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:31.359
every single time I sing"Standing By",
I close my eyes.

01:09:32.943 --> 01:09:37.532
And I think of my mom and I think of my dad and my friends.

01:09:38.366 --> 01:09:40.201
And I open my eyes.

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:45.456
And I see the crowd and the reason why I'm not with them.

01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:51.337

It's like a rejuvenation.

You know,
it's funny, I feel like,

01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:20.277
there's "Standing By" and then there's "On My Way Home."

01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:24.990
After being without that person or
without that thing or whatever it may be

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:28.869
that you are standing by for,
you are...

01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:31.372
You're on your way.

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:34.417
And when we sing that song,
we are on our way home.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.920
And this whole tour, we were
literally on our way home.

01:12:38.045 --> 01:12:40.089

isn't my home,

01:12:40.172 --> 01:12:41.840
it is where
the group started.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.594
And I feel like
it is a part of me as well.

01:13:07.074 --> 01:13:08.284
Oh, my God.

01:13:08.367 --> 01:13:09.744
Why?
What's wrong with them?

01:13:10.077 --> 01:13:12.079
Good
I think they're awesome.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:17.251
This was actually the
very first thing that Mitch ever sang to.

01:13:17.668 --> 01:13:20.003
And he was like
three years old.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.590
And I was like,
my gosh he's on key!

01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:25.551
And when he was about eight years old he was in a play.

01:13:25.676 --> 01:13:29.888
Then at the end. He sang "America."
And his mom and I were in tears.

01:13:30.013 --> 01:13:32.767
We had no idea
he could sing like that.

01:13:32.891 --> 01:13:34.769
Because he wouldn't
sing in front of us.

01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:37.020
We would sit in the living room
and ask him to sing for us,

01:13:37.104 --> 01:13:40.775
he would go behind the fireplace and sing back there

01:13:40.857 --> 01:13:44.654
because he was too shy to come out in the front and let us see him.

01:13:44.779 --> 01:13:47.782
So, times have changed.

01:13:48.282 --> 01:13:49.450
Pretty crazy.

01:13:49.866 --> 01:13:52.787
They used to have these at the state fair,
and I would win them.

01:13:52.869 --> 01:13:54.037
You won a lot.

01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:55.247
Like... Like I know.

01:13:55.456 --> 01:13:58.292
It was that really easy one where you pop a balloon with a dart.

01:14:04.799 --> 01:14:05.758
Oh, okay.

01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:10.262
Okay, let's go.

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:12.515
Parking?

01:14:13.056 --> 01:14:14.099
Oh, in the front
of the school?

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.184
Yeah.

01:14:15.267 --> 01:14:17.812
I know that's not my choir.
Hold on, I gotta call Scott.

01:14:24.151 --> 01:14:25.361
Oh!

01:14:26.654 --> 01:14:30.032
Uh... I don't know.

01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:32.535
So, we're heading
to Martin High School.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:37.289
Which is where, in a way,
Pentatonix really began.

01:14:37.748 --> 01:14:39.124
This is a blast
from the past.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.334
Oh, my God.

01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:41.502
I haven't been here
in so long.

01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:43.003
We arranged "Telephone",
right in here.

01:14:43.086 --> 01:14:44.254
Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.338 --> 01:14:45.964
It was this one.
No, that one.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.090
It was this one.

01:14:47.174 --> 01:14:49.218
You're right. This is...

01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:51.261
This is where
it all began.

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.724
What is it now?

01:14:54.807 --> 01:14:56.308
Oh, yeah. Great.

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:57.434
- Still there.
- There it is.

01:14:57.518 --> 01:14:58.519
This is where
it all began.

01:14:58.602 --> 01:15:00.896
And then... Oh, my gosh!
This is what was crazy.

01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:03.399
We, like, didn't really like it
that much, our arrangement.

01:15:03.482 --> 01:15:06.318
And we walked out and Kayla Medlow and Kelly Nicholas were like...

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:07.778
What y'all doing?

01:15:07.862 --> 01:15:09.488
We just arranged something,
but we didn't like it

01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:10.989
and they were like,
"No, sing it for us."

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.325
And so we sang it for them and they were like,
"It was amazing."

01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.870
- And we're like, "Oh, maybe it is good."
- We're like, "Okay."

01:15:15.952 --> 01:15:18.205
So, without them
Pentatonix wouldn't exist.

01:15:18.288 --> 01:15:19.289
Thanks, Kelly and Kayla.

01:15:19.373 --> 01:15:20.374
Thanks, Kelly and Kayla.

01:15:20.499 --> 01:15:22.710
And then Miss O wanted us to
sing it at the choir concert,

01:15:22.793 --> 01:15:24.253
or it really wouldn't
have existed,

01:15:24.336 --> 01:15:27.172
because then Mariah James' brother wouldn't have posted the video.

01:15:27.464 --> 01:15:28.924
A million planets
had to line up.

01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:31.134
Thanks high school friends!

01:15:31.385 --> 01:15:33.596
And brothers
of high school friends.

01:15:33.721 --> 01:15:35.264
Can they take pictures?

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:36.973
Yeah, yeah...

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:45.315
Y'all have heard
of Pentatonix, right?

01:15:45.399 --> 01:15:47.150
Yes!

01:15:49.236 --> 01:15:52.030
My, like,
choir teacher is here from high school.

01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:55.992
And, like... Oh,
my... My music teacher from elementary is here too.

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:59.580
And, like,
a lot of my elementary school and my second grade teacher is here,

01:15:59.663 --> 01:16:03.292
And, I love that, that's really awesome,
but it always makes meso nervous.

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:07.797
Because I just, like,
wanna do well and wanna make them proud.

01:16:08.505 --> 01:16:09.590
Love your shirt.

01:16:09.673 --> 01:16:12.175
Thank you.
Thought it was appropriate for the last night.

01:16:12.259 --> 01:16:13.552
Why didn't I get that?

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.721
In fact, they're gonna be
crazy tonight.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:18.181
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:16:18.348 --> 01:16:19.558
More parents.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:20.851
How are y'all doing?

01:16:21.393 --> 01:16:23.186
Ready for the last show
of the concert.

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.105
Your last concert
of the tour.

01:16:25.188 --> 01:16:27.316
In Texas.

01:16:29.234 --> 01:16:32.195
And I rode on a ride at Busch Gardens with the guy

01:16:32.279 --> 01:16:33.823
that films the video board
every place.

01:16:33.906 --> 01:16:34.907
Oh, really?

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.243
Says it takes him about an hour for
him and his crew to put it all together.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:42.164
I couldn't believe they had all this stuff now.
This is crazy.

01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:51.799
Last sound check.

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:04.520
Last show.
Last show. Last show.

01:17:05.145 --> 01:17:06.522
That's going to be sick.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.066
Can we do like
fierce catwalk?

01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:11.193
Last show.

01:17:11.276 --> 01:17:12.486
Last show.

01:17:12.569 --> 01:17:14.363
We can do...
We can do a fierce catwalk.

01:17:15.113 --> 01:17:16.365
After you, sir.

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:27.918
- Now he does it.
- That's incredible.

01:17:33.799 --> 01:17:34.925
I'll do my cape.

01:17:35.009 --> 01:17:36.510
Yes, yes...

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:39.221
...and none of y'all
saw it.

01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:41.015
I saw everything.

01:17:42.975 --> 01:17:44.434
Is the staging set?

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.270
Oh, no,
we should've done...

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:54.820
Let's do it.

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.365
...standing by.

01:17:58.448 --> 01:17:59.366
Are you gonna watch?

01:17:59.449 --> 01:18:00.367
Yeah,
I'm gonna watch.

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:02.285
Yeah. Hell yeah,
I'm gonna watch.

01:18:04.872 --> 01:18:05.915
Yes, sir.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:14.631
Here we go!
Kill it.

01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:19.511
On My Way Home.
It ends tonight. We're doing it.

That you guys actually might know,
but that's okay.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:13.065
This story begins
in Arlington, Texas.

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:17.069
With three little baby singers right there.

01:19:17.861 --> 01:19:18.862
Oh, boy.

01:19:18.946 --> 01:19:19.947
All right.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:23.993
During the story moment I was just,
in my head thinking about so many things.

01:19:24.076 --> 01:19:26.536
I was getting all teary eyed.
I was not paying attention.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.873
Hey, no, it's been great.
It's been... Yeah, the energy's good,

01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:34.003
it feels good and it's just, like,
you are excited with you guys.

01:19:34.086 --> 01:19:35.253
If that makes sense.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.547
Totally.
It's a good feel.

01:19:37.631 --> 01:19:39.008
I was nervous
when we first started.

01:19:39.091 --> 01:19:40.509
Me too,
I was really nervous.

01:19:40.634 --> 01:19:44.096
It is so crazy because my eyesight is like when I was eight years old.

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:46.222
My voice teacher, my parents,
my sister, my brother.

01:19:46.306 --> 01:19:47.307
I can see them all.

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:48.266
That's kind of crazy.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.559
It is such a trip.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:52.646
And I'm...
It's reminding me of when I did recitals and they would come.

01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:53.814
- Whoa!
- I know.

01:19:53.897 --> 01:19:56.775
And I can see where I sat when I went to a concert when I was 15 here.

01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:59.235
It's like a lot.
And I'm pretty much...

01:19:59.987 --> 01:20:01.571
Don't let
your makeup run, girl.

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:05.701
I almost got like really choked
up during "Rather Be."

01:20:05.784 --> 01:20:07.410
And then I was, like,
I have to stop,

01:20:07.494 --> 01:20:10.706
because the second I start getting, like...
throat closing,

01:20:10.789 --> 01:20:12.833
crying almost...
I'm going to ruin my life.

01:20:12.958 --> 01:20:15.919
So I stopped. I'm having a very good time.
They're really great.

01:20:19.756 --> 01:20:22.509
All right. Thank you, guys,
so much for coming out.

01:20:22.592 --> 01:20:24.053

a special night.

01:20:24.136 --> 01:20:27.305

because we're home now.

01:20:31.143 --> 01:20:32.978

01:23:56.806 --> 01:23:59.309
I know.
When I started thinking about it I was, like...

01:23:59.393 --> 01:24:01.186
I was so emotional too.

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:03.479
I looked over
at you and Mitch

01:24:03.563 --> 01:24:05.941
- and I was thinking about all our memories...
- No, that's why...

01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:08.944
That's why during "On My Way Home",
I was, like...

01:24:10.153 --> 01:24:11.738
- Congratulations.
- Oh, man.

01:24:12.989 --> 01:24:15.284
Hi, congratulations
on an amazing show.

01:24:15.409 --> 01:24:16.826
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:25.377
Oh, my God.

01:24:25.835 --> 01:24:28.838
Great show guys.
Outstanding. So good.

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:31.341
It was so good.

01:24:32.008 --> 01:24:32.926
That...

01:24:33.009 --> 01:24:33.885
Hi, mom.

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:37.013
Mario came and danced.
Oh, my God. It was just awesome.

01:24:37.097 --> 01:24:38.265
Did you hear me whistling?

01:24:38.348 --> 01:24:39.766
No, I didn't.

01:24:39.849 --> 01:24:41.768
Oh, my gosh.
It was incredible.

01:24:41.851 --> 01:24:43.979
It was just incredible to watch.
I'm so proud of you.

01:24:44.104 --> 01:24:45.855
Thanks, dad.

01:24:46.022 --> 01:24:47.149
I love you.

01:24:47.232 --> 01:24:48.483
I love you, too.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.945
Good job tonight.

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:54.448
Yes.

01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:55.657
I feel like a baby.

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.200
Good last show kisses.

01:24:57.284 --> 01:25:00.078
There was just like such a connection between the audience and us.

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:01.079
It was just crazy.

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:02.080
They were happy for us.

01:25:02.164 --> 01:25:03.790
And we were happy
they were there.

01:25:03.873 --> 01:25:05.292
It was really, really cool.

01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:07.502
You know what else I loved?
That it was our last show

01:25:07.585 --> 01:25:09.045
- 'cause I know the show so well.
- Yes.

01:25:09.129 --> 01:25:10.672
So I didn't really
have to over think.

01:25:10.755 --> 01:25:13.258
Technicalities... I was like,
I can just live and do the show.

01:25:13.467 --> 01:25:15.427
Yeah. That's a good plan.
We should definitely...

01:25:15.635 --> 01:25:17.095
You're right.
We should--

01:25:18.054 --> 01:25:20.140
On My Way Home,
going home, home...

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.516
Take me home tour.

01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:22.725
Take me home.

01:25:23.059 --> 01:25:24.978
♪ Take me home ♪

01:25:25.895 --> 01:25:28.857
That was our last show of the tour and I was very nervous

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:31.526
because I feel like
it was sort of my...

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:34.237
my recital,
to show everybody that I grew up with

01:25:34.321 --> 01:25:35.780
like, "Hey, look how far
we've come."

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:38.741
It was just so amazing.

01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:42.037
Being back home,
looking over at Mitch and looking over at Kirstie

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.331
and being like,
"I grew up with these people.

01:25:44.456 --> 01:25:47.959
And now we're back home performing for a sold out crowd."

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.379
It's just kind of everything
went full circle.

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:53.840
It was just so special to grow up with your best friends

01:25:53.923 --> 01:25:55.467
and then be doing
something you love,

01:25:55.509 --> 01:25:57.927
something that turned into
a viable career with them.

01:25:58.053 --> 01:25:59.429
It was so amazing
and it made me

01:25:59.513 --> 01:26:03.350
very thankful for everything
that's happened in my life.

01:26:03.433 --> 01:26:08.021
It's just cool that...
That certain opportunities in life that you

01:26:08.104 --> 01:26:11.358
take as kind of just
a random hunch.

01:26:11.566 --> 01:26:13.109
It's just cool that
taking those opportunities

01:26:13.193 --> 01:26:15.529
can sometimes lead
to what this is now.

01:26:16.154 --> 01:26:18.156
Follow the opportunities
that come,

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.867
because you never know where
they're gonna lead you in life.

01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:26.164
And to think that us, like, who we are as people,
we are just normal people.

01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:29.251
We are just blessed enough
to be able to go on stage

01:26:29.334 --> 01:26:32.212
and have found each other and be able to do what we love.

01:26:32.379 --> 01:26:38.427
What a beautiful feeling to...
To just do something you truly love,

01:26:38.634 --> 01:26:42.264
you put your heart and soul into
and for people to love it back.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.682
