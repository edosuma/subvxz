WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:02.534
- Previously on "Ki/Ijoys"...

00:02.545 --> 00:05.287
- 437 local agents

00:05.590 --> 00:06.955
have stopped reporting for duty.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.331
Until we know why,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.843
my investigators and |

00:09.844 --> 00:11.835
are assuming full control of this RAC

00:11.846 --> 00:13.336
effective immediately.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.383
There are two strains of Hullen.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.723
Some were made to take orders.
Some were born to give them.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.093
- We're coming for you.
- We can't win this war

00:20.104 --> 00:21.184
on skirmishes.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.054
We need bigger targets. We need an army.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.056
Welcome to the revolution.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.932
It's some kind of genetic bomb.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.481
You could wipe out an
entire bloodline with this.

00:29.489 --> 00:30.649
Oops.

00:34.869 --> 00:37.576
Oh, yeah.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.286
- I can't.
- Shh.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.206
- Let them finish.
- Why?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.166
We have guns. They have no pants.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.785
Professional etiquette.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.836
Cardiff's a ranking officer.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.752
From a different sector. Barely counts.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.376
My ears need a shower.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.049
Oh, my God, incoming!
Hard left, hard left!

00:56.057 --> 00:57.922
And counseling.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.516
Guys, kind of on a time/ine.

01:02.188 --> 01:05.146
- May I, Eddie Etiquette?
- You first.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.645
- Oh.
- What the hells?

01:08.653 --> 01:10.189
Is it too late to go back in the closet?

01:10.196 --> 01:11.652
Yeah, a little bit.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.192
Captain Cardiff, we're
taking you to the Quad now.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.655
Are you kidding me?

01:14.659 --> 01:16.524
You know how little free time | get?

01:16.536 --> 01:18.117
- Sorry.
- Apologies.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.656
- You can, uh...
- Very rude.

01:19.664 --> 01:21.746
Cover up with this.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.035
- What the hells is this?
- A hostage-taking.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.661
Again, we apologize.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.829
- What's that for?
- Tipping her.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.875
- She did all the work.
- Thank you.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.503
Heading to Black Site.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.756
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.554
- Had to be done.
- Turin.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.223
What the bloody hells?

01:45.231 --> 01:46.892
Morning, sunshine.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.357
Fancy, want to give Captain
Drunk Pants a poke there for me?

01:51.737 --> 01:54.695
You abducted three
interstellar RAC captains

01:54.699 --> 01:57.190
from the biggest outposts in the J.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.157
That ticks all the boxes for stupid.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.197
Yeah, I wish your travel arrangements

02:01.205 --> 02:02.786
had been more befitting your rank,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.200
but I don't have time to give a shit.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.415
None of us do.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.205
This some kind ofjoke to you, agent?

02:08.212 --> 02:10.999
No, you pompous ass.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.415
This is a bloody coup.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.670
J“ Ooh, ooh J‘

02:19.682 --> 02:20.922
J“ Ooh, ooh J‘

02:22.268 --> 02:22.973
J” Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

02:22.977 --> 02:24.968
J” Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

02:26.063 --> 02:27.803
J“ Ooh, ooh J‘

02:30.276 --> 02:32.312
I'm not gonna pretend that
I ever liked you, Turin,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.685
but I never took you for a traitor.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.356
It's okay, Cardiff.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.150
| always took you for a moron.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.274
But even you've heard
of Level VI, haven't you?

02:39.285 --> 02:42.072
Level VI?

02:42.079 --> 02:44.070
That's a myth. That's horseshit.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.949
Yeah, that's what I thought,
till I met folks like her.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.497
Meet Lucian Kitaan.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.540
Transferred to my RAC nine years ago.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.247
Background unknown.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.089
She's over 100 years old.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.958
Looks pretty good, doesn't she?

02:57.970 --> 03:00.086
- Why isn't she moving?
- A little paralytic agent

03:00.097 --> 03:02.304
we cooked up to help with the fidgeting.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.640
You're gonna let that
Killjoy and all of us go,

03:04.644 --> 03:07.681
or I'm gonna have your balls
and your badge, all of you.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.770
Then I definitely shouldn't do this.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.898
They're called Hullen.

03:16.906 --> 03:19.318
Human hosts taken over
by an alien parasite.

03:19.325 --> 03:22.112
Turns them into hive-minded sociopaths.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.075
They're stronger, faster than us,

03:24.080 --> 03:25.786
and they can heal
from almost any injury.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.327
- What do they want?
- To make more of them

03:28.334 --> 03:29.665
and less of us.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.205
Every RAC is crawling with them.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.168
They use RACs to vet viable hosts

03:33.172 --> 03:35.333
and control strategic
positions in the J.

03:35.341 --> 03:37.332
You're only captains in name.

03:37.343 --> 03:40.460
The real power behind
the RAC are the Hullen.

03:40.471 --> 03:43.133
I think I would know if alien parasites

03:43.140 --> 03:45.392
were hiding on my ship.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.759
We knew you'd doubt us,
but we don't have the time,

03:47.770 --> 03:49.601
so tonight we're gonna prove it...

03:49.605 --> 03:52.438
teach you how to clean
your house by cleaning ours.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.602
What the hells does that mean?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.441
We still have Hullen in our own RAC.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.936
Tonight we wipe them
out once and for all.

03:58.948 --> 04:01.360
You have front-row seats to the show.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.948
In front of you, you've got everything

04:02.952 --> 04:05.318
that you need if you join the fight...

04:05.329 --> 04:08.036
the locations of all the plasma
pools nearest your own RACs,

04:08.040 --> 04:11.248
a sample of the black plasma
you'll use to poison that pool

04:11.252 --> 04:14.119
so these alien dickholes
don't replicate,

04:14.130 --> 04:18.294
and a knife that you'll use
to prove that you're all human.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.133
- What's in the cup?
- Coffee.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.220
It's gonna be a long night.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.055
Commander, why was
Fell Squad given orders

04:34.066 --> 04:36.978
to divert course?

04:36.986 --> 04:39.477
There is a package I need collected.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.649
Fell Squad was closest to coordinate.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.693
Fell Squad monitors the Quad.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.283
After Kendry's misguided
warrant for the Killjoy,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.653
I thought we agreed the Quad
was of no strategic value.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.200
Oh, did we?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.822
Poor Kendry's been feeling homesick,

04:51.834 --> 04:54.041
so I thought I'd bring
her back something...

04:54.044 --> 04:57.252
- pretty from her galaxy.
- Ooh.

04:58.883 --> 05:02.000
Commander, as your second,

05:02.011 --> 05:04.969
it is challenging to fulfill my duties

05:04.972 --> 05:08.464
if you don't share your plans with me.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.761
You know there could be consequences

05:09.769 --> 05:11.634
to our acting alone.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.431
Consequences?

05:14.899 --> 05:17.686
Consequences like these?

05:17.693 --> 05:20.105
My counsel

05:20.112 --> 05:23.195
is a privilege, Gander,

05:23.199 --> 05:25.360
not a right.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.403
Aneela, please.

05:28.204 --> 05:32.322
The poor little nugget is
only trying to serve you...

05:32.333 --> 05:35.700
as best as he knows how.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.794
- Thank you, Commander.
- Thank her, nugget.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.341
Thank you, Kendry.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.344
Seyah Kendry is my full title.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.973
Seyah.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.731
Commander.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.235
Not getting nervous
about your op, are you?

06:07.243 --> 06:09.950
- I don't do nervous.
- Might want to start.

06:09.954 --> 06:12.821
Kidnapping RAC captains?

06:12.832 --> 06:16.541
If we fail, they'll bring the
entire agency down on our heads,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.751
and, oh, yeah, humanity dies.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.211
Well, your pep talk needs work, Coach.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.706
-AII human.
- Even Cardiff?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.708
Well, I guess even the
Hullen have standards.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.550
Me and Fancy will
keep the brass in line.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.341
You go kick some alien ass.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.135
Planning on it, starting
with Banyon Grey.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.894
Captain, latest
surveillance report

06:37.898 --> 06:40.605
on target agents...
no missteps yet.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.443
Don't worry. They will.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.437
Attack squads are on approach.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.570
Know your pattern, and we all come home.

06:50.578 --> 06:54.070
Sweep, search, skewer, squad by squad.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.242
Each squad has been
assigned a sector of the RAC.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.834
Ours is 40. Area maps are on your PDDs.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.702
Level Ills and up, keep
an eye on the newbies.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.295
Lose one and answer to me.

07:03.299 --> 07:05.005
Benji, McAvoy, you're with us.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.624
What is it, Pukes?

07:06.635 --> 07:08.921
There'll be hundreds
of agents on the ship.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.261
- How many are Hullen?
- We don't know.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.971
We're hunting Hullen in a haystack.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.465
But if they look just like us,

07:14.476 --> 07:16.091
isn't it hunting hay in a haystack?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.970
That's what these are for, wiseass.

07:18.981 --> 07:22.439
Do not remove your masks until
Johnny has vented the station

07:22.443 --> 07:23.933
and given us the all-clear.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.809
The paralytic agent he's releasing

07:25.821 --> 07:28.358
works on Hullen and humans,

07:28.365 --> 07:30.617
so if this shit gets in your lungs,

07:30.618 --> 07:32.529
your muscles seize for hours.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.278
- Where's Johnny now?
- Doing what he does best.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.373
Jerry, my friend,

07:41.003 --> 07:42.334
l have returned.-

07:42.338 --> 07:43.999
Get the hells out of here, Jaqobis.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.539
It's my ass if Turin
finds out you're here.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.791
Gingervitis still
can't take a joke, huh?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.054
Dude, you vented the
box through his office.

07:51.055 --> 07:54.468
Which is why I brought air
freshener, to make amends.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.885
Leithian pine.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.885
Sorry, Jer.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.480
Way to make me not
have to kill you, Jer.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.235
I owe you a beer.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.283
Now...

08:19.291 --> 08:23.034
to seduce life support with
some sweet, sultry hacking.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.412
Special targets need special weapons.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.085
Test is simple.

08:29.093 --> 08:31.049
They bleed, they're human.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.419
They heal on the spot...

08:35.933 --> 08:38.925
This will be your new best friend.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.848
Remember, jab and stab to the brain pan.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.846
Aren't they still Killjoys?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.564
These are not your friends.
These are not your coworkers.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.433
They're an alien bug who will kill you

08:48.445 --> 08:50.276
and wear your body like a sweater.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.272
So don't cry for the monsters we kill.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.070
Think of the Killjoys we save.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.319
Damn, you give good speech, lady.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.413
External comms are disabled.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.749
The only data going out is
our feed to the Black Site.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.789
We 're live to air, people, so
look pretty for the cameras.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.540
You heard the man. Final weapons check.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.712
What if we get separated?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.301
| make one promise to my team...

09:14.304 --> 09:16.010
if I got you in,

09:16.015 --> 09:18.051
I'll get you out.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.969
I can’t believe you say
that to all the nerds.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.389
What, you didn’t think
you were special, did you?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.227
RAC systems are synced to your PDDs,

09:24.231 --> 09:26.438
which means masks on, ladies and gents.

09:26.442 --> 09:27.932
We are officially a go.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.353
Copy that. Go for attack.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.272
Yes, they are stronger and faster,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.316
but they are not Killjoys.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.154
We do not run.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.615
We do not hide.

09:37.036 --> 09:40.153
We hit first.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.246
The warrant is all.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.615
All: The warrant is all.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.252
A and B Squad are
in ﬁnal approach.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.214
Docking now. Good luck in there.

09:58.849 --> 09:59.383
Gas is ignited.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.137
Para/ytic effects
will last one hour.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.181
All units wait for my signal.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.726
Warning...
contamination detected.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.945
Proceed to emergency stations.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.610
Captain, your target agents
have entered the RAC.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.328
I've got you now.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.958
All squads go for entry.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.752
Dutch '3 strike team
has deck to 40.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.672
Venting complete.
Oxygen levels normal.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.261
Boys...

10:43.268 --> 10:45.554
time to slice and dice.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.444
Just nick them, McAvoy, you
don't need to shave them.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.663
Everybody stay calm.
We're not here to hurt you.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.702
Most of you.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.495
Damn, another bleeder.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.288
Which is a good thing.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.082
I thought you were worried
about killing Killjoys.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.046
The Hullens aren't Killjoys, right?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.462
Meat puppets in a uniform?

11:18.262 --> 11:19.843
Once we sweep this sector,

11:19.847 --> 11:21.337
we regroup with the rest of the squad.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.509
Copy that.

11:24.768 --> 11:28.511
- Guys, I think I got one.
- Then you know what to do.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.523
If he could move, Benji, he
wouldn't hesitate to kill you.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.485
Come on. Don't be a pussy, Benj.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.025
You got this, Pukes.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.362
So, so, so sorry.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.485
Benji!

11:44.496 --> 11:45.906
Sweet mother of shit.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.779
Why aren't they paralyzed?

11:48.584 --> 11:51.417
- They keep coming.
- Headshots, then dreadnoughts.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.708
Dutch? D'Av?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.421
Someone respond. What
the hells is going on?

11:56.425 --> 11:58.507
How the hells are the Hullen moving?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.171
It's an ambush.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.010
They're outnumbered.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.424
They have to get the hell out of there.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.844
They've seen worse odds. Trust me.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.557
Dutch knows what she's doing.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.223
The blasts can kill our
own. Watch your fire.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.351
— There's too many of them.
- Keep it together, newbie!

12:22.534 --> 12:25.196
Clear my path.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.320
Hold on, Benji!

12:27.331 --> 12:30.994
J” Burn the ashes J‘

12:31.001 --> 12:34.209
J“ Fire burns J‘

12:34.213 --> 12:38.126
J” Rising slowly J”

12:38.133 --> 12:41.045
J“ As you fall J‘

12:42.221 --> 12:48.217
J” Rise J‘

12:48.227 --> 12:52.937
J” Rise J‘

12:56.401 --> 12:58.062
Why the hells is the gas not working?

12:58.070 --> 12:59.150
I don't know.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.769
This is a disaster.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.987
This is worse than a disaster.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.948
This is a failed goddamn
mutiny, and that is on you.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.911
Shut your mouth so I can
think beyond the fumes.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.075
You had that green shit in your veins.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.619
Any idea how they got the jump on us?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.742
Wait, wait, hold on.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.119
Are you saying he was one of them?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.290
Not on purpose.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.834
I'm better now.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.627
Here.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.546
- Talk.
- Hullen don't play possum.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.548
If all they wanted
was to stop our attack,

13:29.559 --> 13:30.969
we never would have got inside.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.514
They want something else.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.933
Shit. Shit.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.851
Kitaan's only been in custody a week.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.144
She may know something.
Let me talk to her.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.983
Dutch took the last of the nerve toxin,

13:40.988 --> 13:42.944
and that shit's wearing off.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.813
I'm not putting you alone
in a cage with a barracuda.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.316
She's got a bomb collar.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.863
What can she do?

13:48.870 --> 13:53.284
Blow her head off if she tries anything.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.254
- Medi patch.
- They were mainlining

14:01.258 --> 14:03.089
anti-paralytic the whole time.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.084
That's why the gas didn't affect them.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.837
- They knew we were coming?
- Because someone sold us out.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.179
We have a mole.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.843
What about the other strike teams?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.136
Well, most of their comms are offline.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.135
They're either hiding or dead.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.977
We need to abort, get
back to the Black Site,

14:15.981 --> 14:17.972
have the other RAC captains
call for reinforcement.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.689
They can't call for
backup until they know

14:19.693 --> 14:21.979
their own RACs are
clean, and we can't abort

14:21.987 --> 14:24.820
because we've paralyzed every
human on this goddamn station.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.529
We're the only ones
who can stop the Hullen

14:26.533 --> 14:28.990
- from slitting their throats.
- Ammo's tight.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.905
We didn't pack for active combatants.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.289
We're outnumbered maybe ten to one.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.039
Let's head to the Armory...

14:37.044 --> 14:38.625
start shopping for some heavy firepower.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.755
I'll cook us up a shortcut.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.461
I promised Benji I'd
get him out of this.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.804
He knew the risks. He went out a hero.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.513
Got our exit.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.470
McAvoy, let's go.

14:57.481 --> 15:00.393
Move fast, stay close.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.942
Keep your distance.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.981
If she tries anything,
she's brain paste.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.945
Someone cut the feeds. We've lost eyes.

15:10.952 --> 15:14.490
Make it quick.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.502
Bad day at the office, huh?

15:23.507 --> 15:24.917
Hmm.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.296
A Squad, we can't hear you.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.295
We 're taking ﬁre!
Retreating now!

15:31.306 --> 15:34.844
Heading to the Armory.
We'll join you when we can.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.933
First firefight?

15:36.937 --> 15:39.269
Benji had a quick death.
He wouldn't have felt it.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.058
Yeah, if you forget the strangling part.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.727
There's a time for sad, okay?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.520
But right now we need
to hold on to the mad.

15:44.528 --> 15:47.110
- It'll keep you alive.
- He shouldn't have died.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.604
Benji didn't even want field duty.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.276
I pushed him. I'm just so sick

15:50.283 --> 15:52.490
of guys like you getting
all the guns and glory.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.782
Don't feel so glorious, does it?

15:57.999 --> 16:00.126
Quickest way is through
that garbage chute there.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.663
Perfect.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.251
Time to get your hands dirty, McAvoy.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.213
You have no idea.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.549
Oh, please. Weapons down.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.220
I suggest you follow
the young man's lead.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.930
| suggest you learn how to count,

16:15.934 --> 16:17.344
because you're outnumbered.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.594
Hmm, one, two, three, four.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.642
Oh, look, we have more.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.107
Guns down. Thank you.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.615
You see, we'd rather not
damage the merchandise.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.952
Stop her!

16:45.964 --> 16:48.080
You, find her.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.083
Or the commander will boil
your eyes in their sockets.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.175
Well, they say

16:57.309 --> 17:00.051
that one man's trash

17:00.270 --> 17:02.386
is another man's treasure.

17:03.607 --> 17:07.600
Which one are you?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.825
And shit.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.250
Boys, if you can hear me,

17:26.254 --> 17:27.585
I'm heading to the Armory.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.580
I'm clean if you're worried.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.082
Getting tested regularly,
that's just good manners.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.880
Sample successful.
Label this Jaqobis one.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.253
You don't have to worry
about D'Av, though.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.765
He's going through a bit of a dry spell.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.052
Yeah. I had a little brother once.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.893
It's a complicated relationship.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.478
That's probably why I killed him.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.063
His constant need

17:47.067 --> 17:50.025
to prove himself to me was exhausting.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.235
Am I right, D'Avin?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.945
Look, I don't mean to
insult another man's work,

17:53.949 --> 17:56.315
but I've seen kittens
play better mind games.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.324
Go. Take a jump ship.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.699
Leave the Quad and wait for
your orders from the commander.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.453
I have so many questions.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.499
Where to begin?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.168
How about...

18:12.175 --> 18:16.009
how exactly did you
poison our pool in Arkyn?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.877
We know it was someone on your team.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.220
We just don't know how.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.340
So what makes you boys so special?

18:21.351 --> 18:22.887
Hey, we'd love to tell you...

18:22.894 --> 18:24.805
- super-chatty guys...
- Super chatty.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.724
But then you'd have no
reason to keep us all alive.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.973
Hmm, perhaps a little incentive, then.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.522
I could execute all the humans

18:32.529 --> 18:34.360
that you so thoughtfully
paralyzed for us.

18:34.364 --> 18:38.778
Theatrics can be a persuasive tool,

18:38.785 --> 18:42.243
but I'm also drawn to
more intimate threats.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.364
Well, then I hope that Chair's
ribbed for our pleasure.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.285
You see, the beauty of this device

18:50.922 --> 18:53.413
is your low pain tolerance
makes it very effective,

18:53.758 --> 18:56.420
but your soft tissue
makes it very entertaining.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.465
- Oh, sounds like a dare.
- Yes.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.385
I double-dog-dare you...

19:03.393 --> 19:05.725
to watch your brother suffer...

19:10.191 --> 19:12.273
Until you give me the
answers that I need.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.562
Hey!

19:13.570 --> 19:15.276
Such a waste.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.781
Khylen's right-hand
man demoted to asswipe.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.692
Bad look for Hullen.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.904
I'm not Hullen anymore.
I've been cleansed.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.077
Ha, is that what the
kids are calling it?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.372
Must be recent.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.502
You said they feel no emotions.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.551
Manipulation is not an emotion.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.216
Hullen feel no connections,

19:42.474 --> 19:45.807
but they love to mess with your head.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.019
The longer your brother
sits in the hot seat,

19:49.230 --> 19:51.846
the more the machine eats his memory.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.773
Little details go first...

19:53.777 --> 19:56.564
you know, what he had for
breakfast, his favorite color...

19:56.571 --> 20:00.280
until he loses the concept
of breakfast entirely,

20:01.326 --> 20:02.736
which would be a pity.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.951
I'm guessing he's the smart one.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.079
Maybe this will make you chattier.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.925
Johnny?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.218
Johnny

20:23.556 --> 20:25.421
Bacon,

20:25.725 --> 20:28.182
eggs, and two shots of hock.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.514
I've been blowing my brain
cells for years on booze, boobs,

20:33.525 --> 20:36.107
and back issues of "Captain Apex,"

20:36.111 --> 20:38.648
and I'm still the
smartest guy in the Quad.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.901
Let's see what we can do about that.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.955
Aneela's on the bridge.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.079
But I was hoping to find you, Seyah.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.923
I wanted to thank you for
speaking on my behalf earlier.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.543
If only I had the same soothing
effect on the commander.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.920
What's your technique?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.301
Pillow fights? Bubble baths?

21:07.308 --> 21:09.640
Oh, stop. I'm getting aroused.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.388
How about we skip to
what you want, toad?

21:11.396 --> 21:13.887
Well, what I want involves
excising your tongue

21:13.898 --> 21:16.105
with a nail file, but then...

21:16.443 --> 21:18.308
how would you tell me what you want?

21:18.319 --> 21:19.820
What I want?

21:19.821 --> 21:21.812
The commander showed
zero interest in the Quad

21:21.823 --> 21:23.563
until you arrived,
and now we're heading,

21:23.575 --> 21:25.736
all guns, towards it.

21:25.744 --> 21:28.986
- Imagine that.
- Oh, she changed her mind.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.488
Isn't that the fun of being
an all-powerful despot?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.827
Oh, I wouldn't know,

21:33.835 --> 21:36.417
but I suspect you would.

21:36.421 --> 21:40.289
What does your blunt
little heart desire?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.541
A fleet?

21:42.552 --> 21:46.261
A corner of the J?

21:46.264 --> 21:48.721
I can give you whatever you hunger for.

21:48.725 --> 21:52.434
Said every gross man ever.

21:52.437 --> 21:55.144
I don't need you to
give me things, Gander.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.981
I'm quite capable ofjust taking them.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.976
Well, you'll never take my
place, Seyah, try as you might.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.852
Oh, sweetie...

22:02.864 --> 22:05.105
I already have.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.820
This should make things interesting.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.538
Ah, you brought me a gift.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.579
- Are we dating now?
- Optic implant.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.452
Dial it up...

22:19.464 --> 22:21.125
And you can hear your own blood pumping,

22:21.132 --> 22:22.793
your eyeballs moving.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.632
You can't focus.

22:24.636 --> 22:28.379
It will drive anyone crazy, even you.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.685
What's happening in the RAC?

22:36.689 --> 22:40.682
What are your people doing to my people?

22:40.693 --> 22:44.311
Remind me... which of
them are your people now?

22:44.322 --> 22:46.938
Hullen...

22:46.950 --> 22:49.692
or human?

22:49.702 --> 22:53.570
Well, doesn't that
just cuddle my ballsack.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.118
Whole operation's gone
sideways, and what do you do?

22:56.125 --> 22:57.581
You put an ex-double agent in a cell

22:57.585 --> 22:59.200
with a former puppet master.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.375
- Solid strategy, Turin.
- Fancy is cleansed.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.668
Poison the source,
and the parasites die.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.509
That's the rainbow at
the end of this shit-nami.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.379
If there is a mole, Fancy's
the best goddamn shot

23:10.390 --> 23:11.971
we got at learning who it is..

23:11.975 --> 23:15.467
What if he's the mole, idiot?

23:23.403 --> 23:26.145
Almost to the Armory, boys.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.191
Then I'm coming straight for you.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.367
They'll smell me
before they can hear me.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.670
Back to basics, Yala.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.771
- Level 32 is secure, sir.
- Sweep all ﬂoors.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.151
We 're not leaving
until we ﬁnd her.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.750
Who is the mole?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.097
Do you miss it?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.262
How the green connects us?

24:39.270 --> 24:41.807
No fear.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.681
They're all coming back to us, you know.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.774
— The cleansed.
- Bullshit.

24:46.778 --> 24:51.442
You traded virtual immortality for what?

24:51.449 --> 24:54.532
A pension?

24:54.535 --> 24:58.119
Working for people who
will never stop fearing you?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.499
My people trust me.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.491
They shouldn't.

25:02.502 --> 25:06.245
I wouldn't.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.995
You traded down,

25:08.007 --> 25:10.464
and that truth

25:10.468 --> 25:12.800
will become an itch,

25:12.804 --> 25:15.136
and it will grow into a burn

25:15.139 --> 25:19.098
until you come begging us
to make you Hullen again,

25:19.102 --> 25:21.218
and they know it.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.892
You weren't cleansed.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.015
You're in remission.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.017
You better double that boy's pension,

25:29.028 --> 25:31.770
or he's coming for all of us.

25:36.953 --> 25:40.161
Johnny. Johnny, you with me?

25:40.164 --> 25:42.701
Johnny, what's 6 times 12?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.291
Ask me questions you
actually know the answer to.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.501
Who's the first person you slept with?

25:53.219 --> 25:56.711
I can't remember.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.509
D'Av, I can't remember.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.007
Surely, whatever you're hiding
can't be worth a Iobotomy.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.680
Depends on who's getting it.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.928
D'Av, let's all just
keep it in our pants

26:04.939 --> 26:06.224
till Dutch gets her ass here, okay?

26:06.232 --> 26:07.938
Such faith.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.807
Perhaps we should give
her a little green upgrade.

26:09.819 --> 26:12.105
Anyone who tries gets a
nasty case of the deeds.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.069
Challenge accepted.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.689
I do hope she hurries.
She's next on my list.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.111
Hang in there, boys. I'm
still in the Armory...

26:22.123 --> 26:25.786
packing a nutritious death
for that little shit burger.

26:36.971 --> 26:40.213
Holy hells.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.715
What are you doing here?

26:49.650 --> 26:52.733
Turin, you cheeky bastard.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.728
Yeah.

26:54.739 --> 26:56.855
Just pack away the most dangerous weapon

26:56.866 --> 26:59.448
ever invented in a dusty box.

26:59.619 --> 27:02.702
All haircut, no brains.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.571
On that we agree.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.375
But whose box are you calling dusty?

27:13.549 --> 27:15.505
I was hoping you'd show yourself.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.468
Banyon, give me the
codes to open the door.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.633
And let you take out more of my agents?

27:21.891 --> 27:25.133
I've got this entire level on Iockdown.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.056
- You're not going anywhere?
- Can we cut the shit?

27:28.064 --> 27:30.726
No one wins an award for
best performance of a human

27:30.733 --> 27:33.190
by an alien parasite bitch.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.570
If my friends die because of you,

27:41.577 --> 27:43.568
I'll scrape out your skull with a spoon.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.160
Fnends?

27:48.668 --> 27:51.080
Give me the override
codes, you Hullen bitch!

27:59.512 --> 28:01.252
Why aren't you healing?

28:02.306 --> 28:04.422
Oh, you're human?

28:04.433 --> 28:07.721
At least one of us is.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.935
He's not gonna tell you anything,

28:09.939 --> 28:12.396
and I don't plan to.
We're cool like that.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.891
You're good men. Good men break.

28:14.902 --> 28:18.065
McAvoy? What the hells is this?

28:21.033 --> 28:24.116
Is the life of an innocent

28:24.120 --> 28:26.736
worth keeping your brotherly secrets?

28:26.747 --> 28:29.079
The suspense is unbearable.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.415
What are you doing,
Radek? We had a deal.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.081
McAvoy, you sold us out?

28:35.882 --> 28:38.339
- It's not what you think.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.207
Don't be modest.

28:41.596 --> 28:44.212
This tricky dicky
traded your attack plans

28:44.223 --> 28:46.259
for the promise of eternal life.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.764
Hmm, too bad, so sad.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.727
Not Hullen material.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.850
I mean, is this what
you're fighting for, boys?

28:56.861 --> 29:00.729
So these shining examples of
the human spirit can survive?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.947
That's the deal. Humans get to choose.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.653
McAvoy chose wrong.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.241
Mm-hmm.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.201
And that's why you'll never defeat us.

29:08.206 --> 29:10.162
Our soldiers lack morality...

29:10.166 --> 29:14.000
biologically incapable
of betraying one another.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.959
That sounds a lot like slavery to me.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.373
Yeah, well...

29:18.299 --> 29:20.130
what empire is built without slaves?

29:20.134 --> 29:21.920
The good kind.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.044
Is that right, McAvoy?

29:26.724 --> 29:29.340
"Nuh-uh, Radek."

29:29.352 --> 29:31.013
See?

29:31.020 --> 29:35.059
Theatrics can be a very
powerful learning tool.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.352
How did you survive the gas?

29:37.360 --> 29:40.147
| used myjacket to
make an emergency seal.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.861
How the hells did you make
it through field training?

29:42.865 --> 29:44.321
Open the doors. I'll go and get help.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.951
I got stabbed. I'm not stupid.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.321
What the hells is going on out there?

29:51.332 --> 29:53.197
Covert op. We used the gas

29:53.209 --> 29:56.622
to flush out hidden
enemies hiding in the ranks,

29:56.629 --> 29:59.211
but we were... we were double-crossed.

29:59.215 --> 30:02.707
- You... you called them Hullen.
- Parasitic collective.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.834
They use the RACs to shop for bodies.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.973
— Level V! is real.
- I knew it.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.215
I've been chasing that
shit for years at my RAC.

30:10.226 --> 30:13.263
Every time I got close, the
brass would shut me down.

30:13.271 --> 30:14.681
That's why I came here...

30:14.689 --> 30:16.975
to find out why your agents went AWOL

30:16.983 --> 30:19.224
and why you were in the middle of it.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.559
I thought you were the enemy.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.481
Same.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.523
Banyon, I'm sorry.

30:27.535 --> 30:31.119
Ah, I bet you that doesn't
come out of your mouth much.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.613
Not one of my go-tos.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.949
Look, d—don't be sorry, girl.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.668
Just be stronger. Be smarter.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.375
And that's the only way we'll win.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.998
G-give me your PDD.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.924
I'll come back for you.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.759
If you don't,

30:54.770 --> 30:57.603
I'll come for you.

30:57.606 --> 31:01.315
Ifl can't break you, how
about I make you one of us?

31:01.694 --> 31:03.275
Hullen have no secrets.

31:03.738 --> 31:06.320
Or are you going to
stop me, big brother?

31:06.324 --> 31:07.939
Thinking about it real hard.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.191
D'Av, don't.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.955
Nice work. Wrong guy.

31:27.094 --> 31:30.006
I've only seen the commander
do something like that.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.219
Now I see why she wants you.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.218
All right, take him to the ship.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.892
Hey, how about round 15.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.389
Still got a lot of sappy love songs

31:41.400 --> 31:43.106
stuck in my head I'm looking to offload.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.816
Oh...

31:45.071 --> 31:47.858
still trying to get out
of your brother's shadow.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.696
Heartbreaking...

31:49.700 --> 31:51.691
if I had a heart.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.988
Kill him.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.870
Stop fighting who you really are.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.913
You've been on both sides.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.163
- You know which one will win.
- Fancy, what's she saying?

32:06.092 --> 32:07.878
Let me out.

32:07.885 --> 32:11.048
Get me to the green so
I can contact our people.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.387
Don't let her mess with your head.

32:13.391 --> 32:17.384
I'll tell them what you did.

32:17.395 --> 32:20.762
You can be whole again.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.765
I am whole.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.142
Oh, well...

32:26.153 --> 32:29.941
I did try.

32:29.949 --> 32:33.658
Pull that trigger, we both go boom.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.572
Do it.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.366
That's how you make it interesting.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.789
Before you get all shooty,

32:44.296 --> 32:46.628
grant a dying man's last request.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.291
I didn't say which of us would be dying.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.043
Thought I'd return the favor.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.678
- McAvoy?
- He's the mole.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.765
What, are you planning
a trip to the beach?

32:57.768 --> 32:59.178
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.722
Where's D'Av?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.560
Radek forced the green magic out of him.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.681
Now they're taking him to
the big Hullen zoo in the sky,

33:04.692 --> 33:06.307
so we have to catch them.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.651
We might not have to.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.229
— Remember this?
- Holy shit.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.696
It's a genetic bomb.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.156
Turin had it locked up in the Armory.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.611
Well, he never was a planner.

33:15.786 --> 33:18.619
All Hullen share the
same parasite DNA, right?

33:18.622 --> 33:20.158
Think we can take them
out with this remotely?

33:20.166 --> 33:22.031
Maybe, if we can find a lab,

33:22.042 --> 33:23.703
and if those bastards

33:23.711 --> 33:25.952
didn't fry the wire
whispering out of me.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.755
Come on, beautiful.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.716
Time to open the kimono.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.711
What are you waiting for? Do it!

33:34.722 --> 33:36.804
- Blow the bomb!
- That's my man in there.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.468
Wake up! They're working together.

33:38.684 --> 33:39.719
- It's an act.
- Shut up!

33:40.144 --> 33:41.759
See, Fancy?

33:42.146 --> 33:44.432
Tell me again about human loyalty.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.889
Suck it, snake.

33:48.736 --> 33:50.192
Turin, open the door!

33:50.196 --> 33:52.778
If you unlock that door,
he's gonna kill us all.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.032
He is not one of us.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.115
Turin!

33:58.162 --> 34:00.869
Lost your chance.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.410
Name one thing that's
better about being human.

34:03.417 --> 34:07.160
One!

34:07.171 --> 34:09.253
Not being you.

34:30.194 --> 34:32.526
Is she dead?

34:32.530 --> 34:35.897
Not yet.

34:40.621 --> 34:44.364
Inform the commander that
we've obtained the package.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.369
We'll head to the rendezvous coordinates

34:46.377 --> 34:48.208
as soon as the rest of the Fell Squad

34:48.212 --> 34:49.543
returns to the ship.

34:49.547 --> 34:51.503
And the rest of the station?

34:51.507 --> 34:54.749
Find the girl, kill the rest.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.803
- I stabbed Banyon.
- Well, that was the plan.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.217
She's not Hullen, Johnny.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.090
She's one of us, and I stabbed her.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.343
- She's still alive.
- We'll get her help.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.349
Promise, but right now

35:07.356 --> 35:11.065
we need to focus on getting D'Av back.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.024
Will the bomb take out all the Hullen?

35:13.195 --> 35:14.605
Maybe.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.112
It targets specific DNA strands.

35:17.116 --> 35:20.700
Hullen DNA is bonded to
the human cells of the host.

35:20.703 --> 35:23.490
Now, in theory, I can
expand the genetic parameters

35:23.497 --> 35:25.362
to tell the difference
between them and us, in theory.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.035
So why isn't your face happier?

35:27.042 --> 35:28.452
Because there's a chance
the bomb won't be able

35:28.460 --> 35:30.416
to tell what is human
and what is Hullen,

35:30.421 --> 35:31.376
and it will kill us all.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.003
Hells, we share 50%

35:33.007 --> 35:35.248
of the same genetic material as that...

35:35.467 --> 35:37.594
soft, yellow thing with the peel.

35:37.595 --> 35:39.756
- What?
- Did I mention that my brain

35:39.763 --> 35:42.175
has been set to scramble
for the past hour?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.763
What other chance do we have?

35:43.767 --> 35:45.598
If those bastards take over the RAC,

35:45.603 --> 35:47.059
then the Quad is finished,

35:47.062 --> 35:49.929
and if they get away with D'Av, then...

35:49.940 --> 35:53.603
we're never gonna get him back.

35:53.611 --> 35:56.148
Load her up.

36:08.542 --> 36:12.000
Ready?

36:12.004 --> 36:13.665
Wait.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.004
Not yet.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.124
I know.

36:18.135 --> 36:22.094
Banana. It's called a banana.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.884
Now!

36:34.568 --> 36:35.853
D'Av?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.146
Hey, D'Av.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.861
Hey. Talk to me.

36:45.579 --> 36:48.195
First girl you slept
with was Jenny Peck...

36:48.207 --> 36:51.415
the summer you turned 15,

36:51.418 --> 36:53.795
and you didn't shut
up about it for weeks.

36:54.213 --> 36:57.705
Oh, 6 times 12 is 72,

36:58.008 --> 36:59.999
sock-tosser.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.966
Where's Dutch?

37:07.851 --> 37:09.307
Sorry.

37:13.315 --> 37:14.725
Victories aren't free,

37:14.942 --> 37:16.853
and this one's cost
us more than I'd like,

37:17.736 --> 37:19.567
but home is home again.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.232
I'm sorry that we doubted you.

37:22.408 --> 37:26.026
Whatever you need from
my people, we're with you.

37:26.036 --> 37:30.245
One fist, one army, one
RAC against the Hullen.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.704
- Good.
- To the ones we lost...

37:33.711 --> 37:37.169
and we who stand, no sides, no bribes.

37:37.339 --> 37:40.456
- The war is all.
-All: The war is all.

37:41.385 --> 37:44.377
Keep them flowing, people.

37:44.388 --> 37:47.596
No one leaves my bar in pain tonight.

37:48.225 --> 37:51.012
- To Banyon.
- All: To Banyon.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.312
This the designated asshole corner?

37:55.315 --> 37:58.273
J” Call me your child... J‘

37:58.277 --> 38:00.939
Look, Cardiff was all over my ass,

38:00.946 --> 38:03.232
and I let myself doubt.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.356
All those Killjoys died
'cause there was a rat

38:05.367 --> 38:07.824
right under my nose and I didn't see it.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.278
You're one of the good ones, Fancy.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.746
J“ Hold on J‘

38:12.750 --> 38:14.456
J‘ Till we get it
all in line... J‘

38:14.460 --> 38:16.246
The asshole corner

38:16.795 --> 38:19.002
only has room for one.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.163
It's all yours.

38:24.887 --> 38:28.971
J“ Pay close attention now J‘

38:31.351 --> 38:36.766
J‘ Don 't make me turn my back
and leave you down and out J‘

38:39.026 --> 38:41.768
Commander, we've lost
contact with Fell Squad.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.443
Wh What about the package?

38:43.447 --> 38:45.688
Well, I presume it
disappeared with them.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.450
Commander, I strongly recommend

38:47.451 --> 38:49.362
you remove Kendry from
your immediate counsel.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.155
Herjudgment is still dangerously human.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.994
And I suggest you remove
your lips from her ass.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.782
Shh. Stop your bickering.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.751
I am very pleased with the both of you.

39:03.217 --> 39:04.753
I'll send a recon crew to determine

39:04.760 --> 39:05.749
what happened to Fell Squad.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.673
Unnecessary. I have what I need.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.886
Commander, may I...

39:09.890 --> 39:12.677
You're dismissed, Gander.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.269
Now will you tell me
what was in the package?

39:25.572 --> 39:26.982
Promise not to tell.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.408
You know, Aneela,

39:31.995 --> 39:33.860
friends share.

39:34.832 --> 39:37.198
Is that what you think we are?

39:38.585 --> 39:41.292
The Hullen have no
need for companionship.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.538
Yes, but you're not quite
like the rest of them, are you?

39:44.800 --> 39:47.257
How about your champion, then?

39:47.261 --> 39:49.126
Secret-keeper.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.673
You have enough sycophants on this ship.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.797
If there's one thing I
learned in my human life,

39:52.808 --> 39:56.300
crowns make for shitty companions...

39:57.646 --> 39:59.136
and lonely queens.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.644
What happened in the Quad, Aneela?

40:04.278 --> 40:06.644
You went after the wrong brother.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.488
| fixed it.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.732
Fixed it how?

40:14.955 --> 40:17.367
Approaching Captain
Cardiff's RAC outpost,

40:17.583 --> 40:18.948
Zar Quadrant.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.288
Your stop.

40:22.296 --> 40:24.252
Oh, it's been a long day.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.542
Well, it's gonna get
longer. Bugs to hunt.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.753
- Pools to poison.
- I'm ready.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.424
Just hope I can recruit
a team as ballsy as yours.

40:33.432 --> 40:37.141
- Thank you, agents.
- Packed and ready?

40:37.144 --> 40:39.760
I didn't really have time
to pack, if you remember.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.762
I would really rather not.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.560
What the hells?

40:48.488 --> 40:51.104
Oh, my God.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.357
J' The tide is high... J‘

40:53.702 --> 40:56.694
Now, let's put Daddy's
killer in the corner

40:56.705 --> 40:59.538
and teach her what pain is.

41:04.880 --> 41:08.338
All... all of them?
You blew up all of them.

41:08.342 --> 41:10.207
Not hers.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.506
Just the stations near the Quad
that were about to betray us.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.926
Be a shame to come all this
way to watch her die on holo.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.974
Playing Gander off me
was just a distraction

41:19.978 --> 41:23.937
to keep us out of your
way to set this up.

41:23.941 --> 41:27.058
J‘ I won't let my
demons win... J‘

41:27.486 --> 41:28.566
When I kill her,

41:28.779 --> 41:31.612
I want her to be completely alone...

41:32.699 --> 41:35.691
like I was for years.

41:36.536 --> 41:39.903
No help coming, no friends.

41:41.208 --> 41:45.121
Fireworks are a nice way to
kick things off, don't you think?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.961
I'm impressed.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.465
You and Gander love
your little intrigues,

41:53.720 --> 41:56.302
but real power is direct.

41:57.724 --> 42:01.091
It's gone... completely gone.

42:01.103 --> 42:04.516
- What about the others?
- Farouk, report in.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.188
Commander Duhane?

42:09.069 --> 42:11.310
I agree.

42:23.917 --> 42:28.661
J” My only rival is within J‘
