00:02.586 --> 00:05.131
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.256 --> 00:07.759
What is that thing
parading around as Grant Ward?

00:07.842 --> 00:09.761
<i>He connects to the Inhumans.</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.681
<i>And they instantly joined the hive.</i>

00:12.764 --> 00:15.100
I have to get back to the base.
They have something we need.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.268
Daisy showed me
the Kree artefact you gave to her,

00:17.352 --> 00:19.938
- and it's missing its companion piece.
<i>- I buried it.</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:23.024
- What is it?
- The only thing that can destroy me.

00:23.108 --> 00:24.275
How do we disinfect Daisy?

00:24.359 --> 00:26.027
Meet Dr Holden Radcliffe.

00:26.111 --> 00:27.654
You're the only one
that can save my friend.

00:31.032 --> 00:33.243
With your help,
we're going to redefine humanity.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.369
How could you...

00:34.452 --> 00:36.621
By re-creating the same
Kree experiment that was done to me.

01:35.346 --> 01:38.558
<i>It was in that moment
my world had changed forever.</i>

01:43.354 --> 01:45.440
<i>The Kree Reapers
brought me back to their ship</i>

01:45.523 --> 01:47.192
<i>and began the experiment.</i>

01:54.741 --> 01:56.284
<i>I didn't know it then,</i>

01:56.367 --> 01:59.704
<i>but the Reapers were using their own
Kree blood to transform my DNA.</i>

02:02.707 --> 02:06.878
<i>Once they changed what I was,
the Reapers took the final step,</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:10.465
<i>fulfilling the promise
of what I would become.</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.977
So that's how you became an Inhuman.

02:23.645 --> 02:25.396
Myself and many others.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.649
Put through the Kree experiment
thousands of years ago.

02:28.483 --> 02:31.236
These first Inhumans,
they were your ancestors.

02:34.405 --> 02:37.742
Your ancestors started HYDRA.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.577
You fought to bring me back,

02:39.661 --> 02:41.329
yet are the only faithful
to evade being captured

02:41.412 --> 02:44.749
after Gideon Malick's
spineless betrayal.

02:44.833 --> 02:48.461
Well, the time has come
for your reward.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.796
Thank you,

02:51.256 --> 02:53.550
but what does that have to do
with your story?

02:53.633 --> 02:55.260
Isn't it obvious?

02:56.511 --> 02:58.972
We've been working hard
to recreate the Kree experiment.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.642
And you're next.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.487
- Any word on Daisy?
- Nope.

03:14.612 --> 03:15.947
You tried reaching out
to any old contacts?

03:16.030 --> 03:17.115
Uh-huh.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.492
- Maybe if...
- We're handling it.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.035
I just want to help.

03:21.119 --> 03:23.997
If I'm locked down on the base,
at least let me do something.

03:24.122 --> 03:26.291
The last time you helped wasn't helpful.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.752
Alisha had answers.
I was just trying to make her talk.

03:29.836 --> 03:32.463
You threatened to torture her.
How'd that work out?

03:32.547 --> 03:35.049
I'm not going to apologise
for trying to save someone I care about.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.719
We all care about Daisy.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.387
- Oh, it's not the same.
- No.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.848
The rest of us have known her
a lot longer.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.267
You really wanna help?

03:44.350 --> 03:46.644
Stop trying.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.525
This is hopeless.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.694
Just hold on, Simmons.

03:54.819 --> 03:57.238
The antitoxin appears
to be fighting the Hive's parasites.

03:57.322 --> 04:00.325
Yes, but first, it would probably destroy
the host immune system,

04:00.408 --> 04:03.828
and who even knows
how it will react with Inhuman DNA?

04:04.662 --> 04:08.541
Well, I'll admit that it's not ideal,
but what other choice do we have?

04:11.336 --> 04:13.171
You didn't see Daisy.

04:14.005 --> 04:15.673
She acted like we were still best of pals,

04:15.757 --> 04:17.216
all while threatening to murder me.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.177
No, you're right. I didn't see that.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.678
I was much too busy listening
to the disgusting face of Grant Ward

04:21.762 --> 04:23.181
act like my dead boyfriend.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.475
That's true. That does sound worse.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.144
Right. If this was a competition,
then I'd win.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.855
I had to shoot him three times
just to shut him up.

04:31.898 --> 04:34.233
- Bet that felt good.
- Yeah, it did.

04:34.359 --> 04:36.361
Though it would have felt better
had he actually died,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.154
instead of just sort of oozing.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.614
What if Hive can't be killed?

04:40.865 --> 04:42.659
What then?

04:42.742 --> 04:46.371
This antitoxin might be the best chance
we have to free Daisy of his hold on her.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.831
Yes, or it could put her
into cardiac arrest or seizures.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.541
Okay, but then
we'll find a way to test it.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.919
And who's going to volunteer for that?
We need an Inhuman,

04:53.044 --> 04:55.213
and those who aren't in hiding
are already under Hive's sway,

04:55.296 --> 04:56.422
and would kill us for trying.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.299
I'll do it.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.719
You can test it out on me.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.458
Footage is from some
mechanic's garage in south Wyoming.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.751
What's in south Wyoming?

05:33.835 --> 05:34.961
Not much,
by the looks of it.

05:35.086 --> 05:38.589
Says it was an old mining town
that went through a natural-gas boom.

05:38.673 --> 05:41.050
But with the influx of dirty wells,
it drove out almost all the locals.

05:41.134 --> 05:42.260
And the ones that remained

05:42.343 --> 05:43.678
were recently bought out
by a shell corporation.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.888
- Owned by Malick.
- Yeah.

05:45.972 --> 05:48.099
And now, the town's crawling
with military.

05:49.017 --> 05:51.394
It seems the personal guard
that we encountered

05:51.477 --> 05:52.687
in Malick's hidden bunker...

05:52.770 --> 05:54.689
They got out with Hive, relocated.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.357
Won't be easy to grab Daisy.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.193
You realise this is a trap, right?

05:59.277 --> 06:01.863
Why? Because we have a lead?

06:01.946 --> 06:03.781
Because Daisy's a highly trained spy.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.825
No S.H.I.E.L.D. agent would get caught
on camera that easily.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.243
She's trying to draw us out.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.787
Daisy warned Fitz
not to have S.H.I.E.L.D. follow.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.706
Why would she want to lure us in now?
It doesn't add up.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.374
None of this adds up.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.461
There's an ancient Inhuman
controlling one of my best agents,

06:16.544 --> 06:19.964
the same agent who helped reprogram
the facial-recognition software

06:20.048 --> 06:21.716
that she just got flagged on.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.718
So, what? Suddenly,
Daisy doesn't know how it works?

06:23.801 --> 06:25.511
No, I don't...

06:29.891 --> 06:31.476
I think she wants us to rescue her.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.561
- Mack.
- Look, just hear me out.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.064
Daisy's too strong
to give up control without a fight.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.274
I think there's a part of her
that's still resisting Hive.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.610
That's just not the reality.
It's you projecting.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.945
Look, Fitz said Daisy wasn't a zombie.

06:43.029 --> 06:44.781
She's still herself,
only with Hive's agenda.

06:44.864 --> 06:45.948
That means she's still in there.

06:46.032 --> 06:47.658
I wish that was true, Mack, believe me,

06:47.742 --> 06:49.994
but we cannot be driven
by our emotions on this.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.288
That's how Ward ended up dead,
which is how we ended up in this mess.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.415
- Sir...
- We don't have time to debate this.

06:54.499 --> 06:56.167
You and I need to get on
the same page.

06:58.503 --> 06:59.962
- Understood.
- Good.

07:00.046 --> 07:03.132
'Cause I'm sending a team in there,
and I want you and May to lead it.

07:03.216 --> 07:04.801
So, then, we are saving Daisy.

07:04.884 --> 07:07.595
This isn't a rescue mission,
Agent Mackenzie, it's a targeted strike.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.015
We're gonna kill Hive.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.812
This town represents
the worst of humanity,

07:15.895 --> 07:18.940
allowing the greed of a few
to destroy the needs of many.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.319
Their water was poisoned,
which drove them out.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.280
Their great failing was
their unwillingness to band together.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.909
Sometimes it's hard to join forces.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.702
You need a good leader.

07:32.954 --> 07:34.413
Like Coulson?

07:35.373 --> 07:37.291
He was the reason
why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.418
S.H.I.E.L.D. is no better
than those Kree Reapers,

07:39.544 --> 07:42.463
both making soldiers
for their never-ending wars.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.219
My friends at S.H.I.E.L.D.
wanted to stop wars, not start them.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.596
By building giant battleships
floating in the sky?

07:51.597 --> 07:54.851
The only reason S.H.I.E.L.D. exists
is to fight wars.

07:54.934 --> 07:56.561
But isn't that why we exist?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.896
I mean, that's what the Kree Reapers
were hoping to make, right?

07:59.605 --> 08:00.648
Soldiers.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.402
Which is not what I became.

08:05.236 --> 08:09.240
Sometimes, the world's
greatest miracles happen by accident.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.994
The world I was born into
was primitive.

08:13.077 --> 08:15.913
It has evolved at a remarkable pace
while I was away.

08:15.997 --> 08:19.625
So, what happened back then,
to get you kicked off of Earth?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.711
People saw the connection I had
with other Inhumans,

08:21.794 --> 08:23.421
and it made them afraid.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.132
That fear bred paranoia,
which led to civil war.

08:26.257 --> 08:27.633
Not much has changed, really.

08:27.758 --> 08:32.763
Only now we have the ability
to recreate the Kree experiment.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.515
Are the patients ready, Dr Radcliffe?

08:34.599 --> 08:36.308
Yes.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.395
Not that you did us any favours
with your alien-abduction story.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.357
Took me a good hour to assure them
there'd be no probes of any sort.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.776
Well, your method is
much more elegant.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.988
Not to mention more efficient,

08:49.113 --> 08:52.867
now that I've added the Terrigen
Crystals to the prokaryotic compound.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.953
You can change their DNA
and turn them Inhuman,

08:56.037 --> 08:57.121
all at the same time?

08:57.997 --> 08:59.290
The old one-two punch.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.792
That particular bit of ingenuity
was my idea.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.211
So...

09:04.295 --> 09:05.504
To the moment at hand.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.175
The world fears our kind of power
because not everyone has it.

09:09.884 --> 09:12.136
Only billionaires can build iron suits.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.056
Only the military
can make super soldiers,

09:15.139 --> 09:16.724
which can only lead to a war of its own,

09:16.807 --> 09:21.812
whereas I plan to apply
a more collectivist philosophy.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.982
Does that mean we can get started?

09:26.651 --> 09:28.653
- Yes.
- Right. Great.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.044
God, please, make it stop!

10:00.268 --> 10:01.394
How many others we got?

10:01.519 --> 10:02.895
Four volunteers from Operations

10:03.020 --> 10:04.730
aware of the danger,
and all pretty gung-ho.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.899
Don't know if that'll be enough
to take out Hive.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.359
Maybe not.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.903
But lucky for us, Coulson had Fitz
open up the cupboard.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.531
Whoa.

10:13.698 --> 10:14.824
I got dibs on that.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.285
Ooh, sorry, O'Brien. Coulson promised it
to me when I signed up.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.953
It's in my contract.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.371
Eyes up front, everyone.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.125
Hive is unlike anything
we've ever faced,

10:24.208 --> 10:25.835
which is why each of you
will be outfitted

10:25.918 --> 10:27.253
with the best S.H.I.E.L.D. has to offer.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.714
Full Kevlar tac, heat-sensitive infrared,

10:29.797 --> 10:32.883
and enough splinter bombs
to turn a small army into pixie dust.

10:33.718 --> 10:35.052
The rest of the gear is up for grabs.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.179
What's the Cavalry packing?

10:37.263 --> 10:39.473
- If I need a gun, I'll take one.
- No.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.100
You'll be taking this one.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.271
We can't leave anything to chance.

10:46.314 --> 10:48.107
You seem extra motivated.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.777
Daisy was my partner. This is on me.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.196
Why is everyone making this
about themselves?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.698
Because I should have seen it, May,

10:55.781 --> 10:57.825
but between her Inhuman
love connection,

10:57.908 --> 11:00.369
and me licking my wounds
after Bobbi and Hunter left,

11:00.453 --> 11:02.330
I took my eyes off the ball.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.457
A good partner would've
seen that she was turned.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.917
None of us saw it.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.878
And you need to get your head straight.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.755
This mission isn't about Daisy.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.256
Agreed.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.133
It's about me making things right.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.935
Wouldn't you have to be infected with
Hive's parasites to test the antitoxin?

11:25.019 --> 11:26.145
Not necessarily.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.773
Simmons gives me the drug first,
takes my tissue sample,

11:28.856 --> 11:30.483
then infects that with Hive's parasites.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.485
This antitoxin
will destroy your immune system.

11:32.610 --> 11:33.652
It could kill you.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.154
You're not the only doctor here.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.490
From what I can tell, the risks aren't
as high as what you're saying.

11:37.615 --> 11:39.283
Don't pretend
that's really your medical opinion.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.659
I'm not pretending.
You're being overly cautious.

11:40.785 --> 11:44.413
Yeah, and you're being a lovesick fool
trying to make a grand gesture.

11:44.497 --> 11:47.041
Fitz, any thoughts?

11:48.292 --> 11:49.293
Uh...

11:50.795 --> 11:54.048
I agree with Simmons
that the antitoxin could be dangerous,

11:55.633 --> 11:57.218
but I also think
there's a chance that it could work.

11:59.387 --> 12:02.098
If Lincoln dies,
do you really want to be responsible?

12:02.181 --> 12:04.642
No, of course I don't,
but this could save Daisy.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.895
Daisy would never want someone
acting so recklessly to save her.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.189
Well, then, I'm glad it's not up to her.

12:17.488 --> 12:19.615
I'm sorry, Agent Campbell.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.659
Come on. You gotta reconsider.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.077
My decision's final.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.329
Fitz-Simmons,
start looking at other options.

12:25.413 --> 12:27.164
We'll go from there.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.225
One Martian Multiball,
three Bumper Blasters,

12:46.350 --> 12:48.727
and a three-way Rocket Combo. Boom!

12:48.853 --> 12:50.229
Good luck beating that score.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.814
Okay, keep your hat on, Dundee,

12:51.897 --> 12:53.107
'cause somebody don't play

12:53.190 --> 12:55.192
when it comes to pinball.

12:55.443 --> 12:56.610
Mmm.

12:56.861 --> 12:57.945
Ah.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.030
This beer is bloody wonderful.

13:00.114 --> 13:01.907
I thought Aussies hated American beer.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.784
Only when we got to pay for it.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.996
It is good to be back
in the real world again.

13:07.079 --> 13:10.040
Yeah, what made you go all
Ted Kaczynski in that trailer, anyway?

13:10.124 --> 13:11.500
Don't know, really.

13:11.584 --> 13:13.586
Just never found people to be
my cup of tea.

13:13.711 --> 13:14.753
They didn't like me.

13:14.879 --> 13:17.381
I didn't like them,
so I thought I'd do everyone a favour

13:17.465 --> 13:19.800
and move as far away
as humanly possible.

13:19.884 --> 13:22.261
That sounds pretty lonely.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.849
Yeah. Never really figured on that part.

13:26.932 --> 13:27.975
Aw...

13:28.934 --> 13:33.647
You're a little baby bird,
all fixed up and back in the wild.

13:33.731 --> 13:35.149
I'm not keen on infantilising,

13:35.232 --> 13:38.235
but I would be willing to let it slide
for a proper dance.

13:38.319 --> 13:39.945
- Oh, okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

13:40.070 --> 13:42.907
But don't get your rhinestones
in a bunch, cowboy.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.159
Let's just keep it to pinball.

13:45.242 --> 13:48.287
Please tell me you're not pining over
Stinkin' Lincoln.

13:49.455 --> 13:51.624
You know, James, just because
you don't care about anyone else

13:51.749 --> 13:52.958
doesn't mean the rest of us don't.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.044
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.171
It's just...

13:57.254 --> 13:58.464
You were S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:58.589 --> 13:59.965
So those people you care about

14:00.090 --> 14:02.176
are the same ones that are trying to
stop what we're doing here.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.595
It's not their fault.
They don't know any better.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.181
Doesn't matter
if they know any better or not.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.682
They're on the opposite side.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.978
I can't see any way
it doesn't end badly for them.

14:15.773 --> 14:16.941
There might be one way.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.777
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

14:22.446 --> 14:24.698
We make them understand.

14:27.451 --> 14:30.871
The genetic makeup of Inhumans
is incredibly complex.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.998
We were bound
to run into complications.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.125
You assured me this would work.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.671
Yes, and it would have if I'd been
provided with the right ingredients.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.132
Are you implying
the mistake was mine?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.511
No. No, no.

14:46.554 --> 14:49.056
Well, yes,
but it wasn't an intentional mistake.

14:49.139 --> 14:53.018
You see, the thing is,
I need DNA from a living Kree

14:53.143 --> 14:54.353
to complete the genome sequence.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.523
The DNA you gave me,
your blood, it's from a...

14:58.691 --> 15:01.652
Dead host.
A handsome, but dead, host.

15:02.403 --> 15:03.737
It's no good.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.656
I mean, it's great for you,
but for this, it's no good.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.242
If this were true,
why are you just telling me this now?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.785
I wasn't sure.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.539
I was swept up in the moment!
I wanted to change the world!

15:13.664 --> 15:15.332
And besides, you're very frightening.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.961
Well, you are right to be scared.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.254
I don't need you.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.172
I can just kill you and inhabit your body,

15:22.256 --> 15:24.049
take your mind, your memories.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.718
Yeah, that's a really bad idea.

15:25.843 --> 15:26.885
You should ask my therapist.

15:27.011 --> 15:29.138
My childhood was a total mess.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.764
And the swim team were not nice to me.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.350
Plus, I can make this work.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.353
Why should I believe you?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.272
Because I want it to work.

15:38.355 --> 15:42.901
This is game-changing stuff,
kick-starting mankind into a new gear.

15:43.027 --> 15:47.281
Everything I've done leading up to this,
it just pales.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.371
I promise, you won't regret this.

15:54.455 --> 15:56.040
I'm your guy.

15:59.251 --> 16:03.255
Yeah, I've been meaning
to ask about those.

16:05.049 --> 16:06.592
What are they for, exactly?

16:08.260 --> 16:10.596
If you were scared before,

16:10.721 --> 16:12.598
you should be terrified now.

16:19.730 --> 16:20.898
Our intelligence suggests

16:20.981 --> 16:23.942
there's at least 40 enemy combatants
on the ground.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.110
And what about Hive?

16:25.235 --> 16:27.738
We've still yet
to verify his location, sir.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.865
Okay. The plan's simple.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.992
Go in, kill Hive, get out.

16:32.076 --> 16:34.662
What's protocol when it comes to
the other Inhumans in town?

16:34.745 --> 16:36.997
Do not engage
unless absolutely necessary.

16:37.081 --> 16:40.084
These people are under Hive's control.
We don't want to hurt them.

16:40.751 --> 16:44.380
I can't be with you on the ground,
but I will be watching your helmet feeds.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.382
Be careful and be smart.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.842
This may be our only chance
to catch Hive by surprise.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.929
And worst-case scenario,
if Hive can't be killed?

16:53.097 --> 16:56.517
I suggest running, very fast, away.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.606
Jemma...

17:02.690 --> 17:06.734
Are we good after,
you know, our disagreement?

17:06.819 --> 17:08.779
Yeah, of course we're good.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.948
If I wanted a boyfriend
who agreed with everything I said,

17:11.031 --> 17:12.532
I never would have
broken up with Milton.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.826
Ah.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.578
Milton!

17:16.662 --> 17:19.289
He was the absolute worst,

17:20.040 --> 17:23.794
what with his stupid,
fat cabbage head of his.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.671
"Hi, I'm... Hi. I'm Milton."

17:25.796 --> 17:28.006
More like a Brussels sprout, really.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.633
But Milton's odd-shaped head aside,

17:29.717 --> 17:31.760
we should make a point
to never let work disagreements

17:31.844 --> 17:34.221
affect our relationship outside of work.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.515
Couldn't agree more, Simmons,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.727
especially since we both know
who tends to be right most of the time.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.270
I assume you're referring to the one

17:41.353 --> 17:44.022
who finished top of our class
at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

17:44.148 --> 17:46.233
Now, that is a sore point,
because we both know

17:46.316 --> 17:48.861
that if I'd just stayed up
and studied all night...

17:48.986 --> 17:50.487
Lincoln.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.074
I'm tired of arguing.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.327
Lincoln, no!

18:06.879 --> 18:09.006
Lincoln. Hey.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.340
Lincoln.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.178
Look at me. Look at me.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.014
I just want to help.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.850
This is an elixir, and it will hopefully
counter the antitoxin.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.561
No. It's gonna work.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.313
We don't have time for this.
Your body is shutting down.

18:24.396 --> 18:28.525
I can handle it.
Please, just let me do this.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.785
<i>Cover rear.</i>

18:37.868 --> 18:40.287
<i>- You got eyes on this, Coulson?</i>
- Affirmative.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.414
There's no sign of Hive anywhere.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.542
We don't have time
to search the entire town.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.340
Isn't that the Inhuman Hive
picked up in South Dakota?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.967
Yeah, he's a real blowhard.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.430
That might work.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.398
Hey, this area's authorised
for HYDRA personnel only.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.108
Who the hell are you?

19:10.609 --> 19:12.236
Hello, gorgeous.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.196
I'm James.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.115
Single, 33, originally from Brisbane.

19:17.241 --> 19:21.036
I'm a Leo, with a little dab of Scorpio
thrown in there for good measure.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.039
I like a decent drink, a decent meal,
and an indecent lass,

19:24.122 --> 19:26.625
and not necessarily in that order.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.751
And you are?

19:28.252 --> 19:29.253
Nauseous.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.839
And wondering what you're doing here.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.883
- You're definitely not HYDRA.
- Mmm-mmm.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.427
This means they brought in
other contractors since Malick died?

19:37.678 --> 19:41.557
Ouch! A contractor? Really?
Is that what I look like to you?

19:41.640 --> 19:44.852
Listen, big shot, this isn't a game.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.520
I need you to tell me
what you're doing here.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.105
I'd rather show than tell.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.622
- You're one of them.
- That's right.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.834
Kind of hand-picked
by the big man himself.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.961
Kind of a number-one draft pick,
if you will.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.963
I had no idea.
Please, you have to forgive me.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.508
Have a drink with me,
and I might consider it.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.804
You're not too bad for security.

20:21.471 --> 20:25.893
Little icy.
Lucky for me, I don't get frostbite.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.270
Were you like this
before you got your powers?

20:28.353 --> 20:30.689
What, 101% awesome? You bet.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.442
Becoming Inhuman
doesn't change your personality.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.652
Who knows?
Might even see for yourself one day.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.158
The big man,
he's working on this experiment,

20:41.241 --> 20:43.869
turning humans into Inhumans.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.872
Ask nicely, might even help you
to the front of the line.

20:50.751 --> 20:54.087
That must be why Hive grabbed
Radcliffe, to make his army.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.381
<i>Stay on alert.</i>

20:56.506 --> 20:57.758
You hear what Coulson just said?

20:57.841 --> 21:00.093
<i>Yeah, sorry. I was just wondering
if there was a chance</i>

21:00.177 --> 21:01.845
<i>this guy doesn't get his ass whupped.</i>

21:01.929 --> 21:03.388
Not a chance.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.392
Alisha said you wanted to see me.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.520
You and I share similar paths.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.232
We were both created
by outside forces.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.943
I'm not sure I'm following.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.654
My powers were given by the Kree,
yours by S.H.I.E.L.D.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.073
They're the ones who made us.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.075
Why are you worried
about S.H.I.E.L.D.?

21:26.787 --> 21:30.332
Because I'm curious
if you can defeat what made you.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.961
The people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
are my friends.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.796
Friends who will turn on you,

21:35.879 --> 21:38.298
who will try and sabotage
the connection we share.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.466
Only because they don't understand,

21:39.549 --> 21:43.136
but they will if we can make them
share our connection.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.640
You want to put your friends
through the Kree experiment?

21:46.723 --> 21:48.934
Once Radcliffe
has worked out the kinks, yeah.

21:49.685 --> 21:50.978
Yeah, I do.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.106
They may not be receptive to that idea.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.899
Well, I have to at least try.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.651
It's the only way we can save them.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.863
And what if you fail?

22:01.947 --> 22:04.408
If they decide to turn on you instead,

22:04.491 --> 22:06.535
to come after us
with their weapons of war,

22:06.618 --> 22:09.621
to kill me, to kill all of us?

22:10.956 --> 22:12.708
What then?

22:14.751 --> 22:18.255
Then I would rip their hearts out.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.632
Hearing that comes as a relief,

22:22.259 --> 22:25.095
especially now
that our plans have changed.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.183
I'm sorry.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.686
There was just no other choice.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.438
We both thought
it was the right thing to do.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.316
Hey. Don't act as if
we're on the same side on this.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.069
Coulson gave you a direct order,
and you disobeyed.

22:41.153 --> 22:44.948
And now,
half the lab's computers are fried,

22:45.032 --> 22:47.117
not to mention the blown servers.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.493
I'm sorry about that.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.787
Really, I am.

22:50.871 --> 22:53.248
But the antitoxin is gonna work.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.374
I can feel it.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.335
Well, we won't know until
Simmons has run some more tests.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.755
And for that,
I'll need to drill inside your head.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.798
Wait.

23:01.882 --> 23:04.593
The tissue sample you need
is from my brain?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.970
That's correct.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.431
Something you would have known,
had you asked questions

23:09.514 --> 23:10.807
instead of going behind our backs.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.684
He's all yours, Doctor.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.608
He sounds pretty amazing.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.735
Oh, yeah.

23:21.818 --> 23:26.406
He's got this whole
Ziggy Stardust vibe thing happening.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.866
It's quite epic.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.910
Well, I would love to meet him.

23:30.368 --> 23:33.413
Well, I just might be able to
broker an introduction for you.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.124
Right now?

23:36.208 --> 23:37.667
You'd really do that for me?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.338
Not so sure if right now works.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.840
I mean, he's kind of a busy guy,
with changing the world and everything.

23:43.924 --> 23:44.966
- Right.
- No, no, no.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.094
Don't go rainy-day blues on me.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.638
He might still be in that
abandoned mining facility.

23:52.933 --> 23:53.975
You got that?

23:55.602 --> 23:56.812
On our way.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.234
Why take over a town
and then move to the outskirts?

24:02.317 --> 24:03.401
<i>I don't know,</i>

24:03.485 --> 24:04.569
<i>but the reason's
probably not good.</i>

24:04.653 --> 24:07.239
Remember, this is Hive.
Be prepared to go in hot.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.325
- Safeties off.
- They were never on, sir.

24:13.078 --> 24:16.414
I was hoping to spare you this,
but it was the only way.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.376
They're coming for us.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.797
- You hearing this?
- Sounds like some kind of radio.

24:32.806 --> 24:35.100
<i>That's definitely no radio
I've ever seen.</i>

24:35.183 --> 24:37.018
I've seen that writing before.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.145
Sir.

24:41.439 --> 24:42.899
Get everyone out of there, now!

24:42.983 --> 24:46.278
You heard him! Move out!
Go! Go! Move it!

24:46.361 --> 24:48.989
Who's coming? S.H.I.E.L.D.?

24:49.072 --> 24:50.699
Not the ones who made you.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.034
The ones who made me.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.120
Move! Go, go, go!

25:02.878 --> 25:04.588
What the hell was that?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.423
The Kree.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.648
The Kree are here?

25:23.732 --> 25:24.900
How did they even find us?

25:24.983 --> 25:27.068
I sent them a signal.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.820
The artefacts from James' trailer.

25:28.904 --> 25:30.155
Are a failsafe to be used

25:30.238 --> 25:32.490
if the Inhuman experiment
ever got out of control.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.327
In case of emergency,
call Kree headquarters.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.162
These Kree are not from
their home world.

25:38.205 --> 25:41.958
They're Reapers.
They exist only to hunt.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.211
And to find humans for your makers.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.755
For thousands of years,
they've remained in stasis,

25:46.838 --> 25:48.340
orbiting our solar system.

25:49.132 --> 25:51.676
So they're coming here to do what,
clean up their mess?

25:52.219 --> 25:54.012
These are the only things
that can defeat you.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.972
Those are your exact words.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.682
The Reapers are my greatest fear,

25:58.808 --> 26:01.853
but with your help, I believe we will...

26:01.937 --> 26:04.105
Rip out their hearts.

26:04.189 --> 26:05.398
Those words are yours.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.067
That's really not what I meant.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.486
I fought a Kree before.
They won't be easy to kill.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.197
These Reapers are even deadlier,

26:12.280 --> 26:15.200
which will make your task more difficult.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.285
My task?

26:17.369 --> 26:20.872
For this experiment to work,
we need blood from a living Kree.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.459
And I want you to get it.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.841
Was that a spaceship?

26:31.925 --> 26:34.219
It's too small,
looks like more of a satellite.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.845
Why am I not relieved?

26:37.555 --> 26:38.848
You find anything?

26:38.932 --> 26:41.851
There's debris everywhere
and some really big footprints.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.437
What, like alien footprints, right?
That's what we're talking about here?

26:44.521 --> 26:47.315
Great. Now we have
more players to contend with.

26:47.399 --> 26:48.817
What, fricking aliens just landed?

26:48.900 --> 26:50.652
We're not gonna take a moment
and let that soak in?

26:50.735 --> 26:54.197
Well, the question is,
whose side are they on?

26:56.032 --> 26:57.117
Run! Go!

27:01.288 --> 27:02.789
Inhuman.

27:02.872 --> 27:06.418
Actually, that's Inhumans, plural.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.849
No!

27:29.232 --> 27:31.776
You should be proud
of what we've become.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.117
He's taking out HYDRA agents.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.410
Or everything he comes across.

27:40.994 --> 27:44.289
This will be a lot easier
if that guy's on our side.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.875
Why would Hive signal these things?

27:46.958 --> 27:49.836
Maybe he's hoping to form some sort of
creepy dude alliance.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.547
These things are hunters, not allies.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.175
Coulson, what are our orders?

27:55.258 --> 27:58.053
Follow at a close distance,
but stay out of that thing's crosshairs.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.893
It senses something in that church.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.186
Yeah, my money's on Hive.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.774
Daisy.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.567
Those aren't our orders.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.779
- Mack.
- I got to try.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.822
I'll meet you at the extraction point.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.085
That wasn't me.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.089
Inhuman filth.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.940
I thought you were gonna
handle this thing.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.191
Now, we're both gonna die!

28:53.274 --> 28:54.317
Nobody's dying here today.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.042
What was that last sound?

29:11.126 --> 29:13.128
The spine.

29:13.211 --> 29:14.337
Now, drain it.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.762
I've spent a thousand years wondering

29:22.846 --> 29:25.056
what would happen
should the blue angels ever return.

29:30.103 --> 29:31.771
You're smaller than I remember.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.778
Now's our chance to go in and unload
while Papa Smurf's got him distracted.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.238
Stand down.

29:40.321 --> 29:42.198
The Kree might just do the job for us.

29:42.282 --> 29:44.284
We don't have to fight.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.119
I'm still grateful to you for making me.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.704
We should not have chosen you.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.748
That was providence
guiding your hand.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.209
Then what guides my hand now?

30:02.552 --> 30:03.845
Poor guy.

30:04.429 --> 30:05.513
He doesn't have much longer.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.682
Will there be enough blood
for the experiment to work?

30:07.765 --> 30:09.184
Yeah, absolutely.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.560
I mean, you were fantastic.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.187
We should have all we need
in the next hour.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.314
In fact, I'm happy to take it from here.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.983
If you've got somewhere else
you need to be, then feel free to...

30:17.066 --> 30:19.068
She's coming with me.

30:21.279 --> 30:22.780
I told Fitz to stay away.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.782
No can do.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.201
Not when my partner needs help.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.328
I don't need your help.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.413
There's plenty of evidence here
to the contrary.

30:30.955 --> 30:33.374
You don't understand.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.876
I'm doing this to help you.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.504
And how is murdering a blue alien
gonna help me?

30:37.587 --> 30:39.088
It's the only way to save you.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.926
We're gonna make you
into an Inhuman.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.100
This isn't you.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.019
I know this is hard for you to hear,
but this is me.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.479
I'm not lost any more.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.773
Everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D.
can finally stop trying to save me.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.441
- This is different.
- Is it?

30:58.525 --> 31:01.319
I mean, first S.H.I.E.L.D. rescues me
from the Rising Tide,

31:01.402 --> 31:03.446
and then from my admittedly
not-so-great parents,

31:03.530 --> 31:06.991
and now, once again, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
rallied the troops to save poor Daisy.

31:07.075 --> 31:09.369
Because you're sick.

31:09.452 --> 31:12.664
That thing is a parasite.
It's messing with your head.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.249
That's what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been doing.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.375
Look at us, Mack!

31:15.458 --> 31:19.587
You were a mechanic, I was a hacker,
and now, somehow, we're soldiers?

31:19.671 --> 31:21.839
The world's changing.
We had to adapt.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.800
We had no choice.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.468
S.H.I.E.L.D. made us into
what it needed.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.220
No.

31:27.303 --> 31:28.805
Nobody at S.H.I.E.L.D.
made you do anything.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.391
But Coulson knew I was lost,

31:31.474 --> 31:34.561
so he'd offered up his team of
misfit toys just to fill that emptiness.

31:34.644 --> 31:36.271
That team cares about you.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.358
I care about you.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.360
So what's that make us?

31:42.443 --> 31:43.528
Friends?

31:43.611 --> 31:45.572
Friends.

31:45.655 --> 31:46.698
Partners.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.449
Bobbi was your partner once.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.617
How'd that work out for you?

31:49.701 --> 31:52.287
You know damn well Bobbi and Hunter
left S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect us.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.456
They left S.H.I.E.L.D.
because there was no reason to stay,

31:55.540 --> 31:57.333
because nobody else at S.H.I.E.L.D.
mattered to them.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.419
It wasn't hard to leave.

32:02.380 --> 32:05.383
But I think you should leave here,
right now.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.650
A part of you wants to come back.

32:22.734 --> 32:23.985
That's how we found you.

32:25.278 --> 32:26.821
What are you talking about?

32:26.904 --> 32:29.949
A few hours ago, we received security
footage of you outside this garage.

32:30.033 --> 32:33.995
It sent a red flag up our system,
the same system you helped create.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.874
So, what, you think that
I meant for this to happen?

32:39.876 --> 32:42.170
It wasn't an accident.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.297
Something inside you is resisting.

32:47.008 --> 32:51.471
I slipped up because
I wasn't thinking like a spy any more,

32:51.554 --> 32:54.098
because I don't need to be
a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent any more.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.850
- Tremors...
- No, no, Mack.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.185
I cared about you, too.

32:57.268 --> 33:01.064
After what happened with my parents,
I needed someone, and you...

33:01.147 --> 33:03.691
You were almost
like a big brother to me.

33:03.775 --> 33:05.985
But let's be honest,

33:06.069 --> 33:09.614
you struggle to be a real brother
to the one that you have.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.866
Leave Ruben out of this.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.576
I understand how you're feeling.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.914
But you don't need
to feel alone any more.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.165
We can fix it.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.292
Now, what you're feeling, it's not real.

33:21.376 --> 33:24.962
What we feel is reality.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.798
It's the way the world was meant to be.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.299
Not my world.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.845
I really wanted to save you, Mack.

33:34.347 --> 33:36.015
Yeah.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.101
Me, too.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.943
If I can't save you,
I guess I'll save everyone else.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.700
I'm no longer the scared hunter
you took all those years ago.

34:03.501 --> 34:04.877
You should have stayed away!

34:06.504 --> 34:07.547
Wait!

34:09.882 --> 34:11.884
Daisy. I'm not gonna fight you.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.867
I wanted you to be a part of this.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.460
Big Blue might just have this one.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.043
Don't be so sure.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.755
Sounds like Hive's nursing
a 1,000-year grudge.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.051
You made something great,

34:55.094 --> 34:56.179
something divine,

34:57.180 --> 34:58.806
and now you want to destroy it.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.564
You're a failed experiment.

35:12.904 --> 35:17.742
Sometimes, the world's greatest
miracles happen by accident.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.460
Take the shot, now! Repeat!

35:27.543 --> 35:28.628
<i>Take the shot!</i>

35:34.842 --> 35:36.010
Piper!

35:50.733 --> 35:51.859
We have to go! Now!

35:51.943 --> 35:53.110
Now!

36:01.911 --> 36:05.206
We could have had a connection
that was real.

36:05.915 --> 36:09.168
Daisy, look at yourself.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.170
You don't have to do this.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.970
I need emergency evac now!

36:29.647 --> 36:31.566
We got to get out of here! Hurry up!

36:31.649 --> 36:33.234
He's coming! He's coming!

37:02.555 --> 37:04.473
I can't believe Daisy did this.

37:07.768 --> 37:09.645
You were right about her.

37:10.438 --> 37:11.647
Really wish I wasn't.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.734
So...

37:14.817 --> 37:18.905
Hive wants to turn any human
into an Inhuman,

37:18.988 --> 37:21.574
regardless of that person's
existing genetic markers.

37:21.657 --> 37:25.161
Might have succeeded, had Mack not
splinter-bombed that Kree.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.412
Well, does it even matter?

37:27.121 --> 37:28.247
That thing...

37:28.873 --> 37:30.666
There's nothing that could stop it.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.095
Wait. What happened?

37:43.179 --> 37:44.931
Is Daisy okay?

37:45.014 --> 37:46.223
The mission failed.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.101
Daisy is still alive,
but they weren't able to stop Hive.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.147
When did this happen?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.316
They returned an hour ago.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.153
An hour ago?

37:59.236 --> 38:01.280
And you just...

38:01.364 --> 38:03.449
Kept me down here this whole time?

38:03.532 --> 38:04.700
Well, you needed to rest.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.244
I needed to be up there, helping,

38:07.328 --> 38:09.789
not locked down here
like some prisoner!

38:09.872 --> 38:11.916
Your immune system
is completely shut down!

38:11.999 --> 38:13.626
Anyone so much as sneezes,
and it might kill you.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.796
So until you've fully recovered,
you are a prisoner.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.589
You're my prisoner.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.387
I'm sorry.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.310
I just don't know what to do.

38:31.894 --> 38:33.604
None of us do.

38:36.065 --> 38:38.526
Did you at least tell Coulson
we might have a cure?

38:38.985 --> 38:40.403
No.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.197
Why not?

38:44.991 --> 38:46.283
Because we don't.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.035
That's what I came down to tell you,

38:48.119 --> 38:51.706
the antitoxin, it didn't work.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.335
Now, get some rest.

39:07.847 --> 39:10.016
I ripped out its heart,

39:10.099 --> 39:12.184
as discussed.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.771
But you failed us.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.983
I tried to stop him.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.943
Then your efforts were lacking.

39:21.027 --> 39:23.821
Not only did your friend destroy
everything we've been working towards,

39:23.904 --> 39:25.531
he also got away.

39:27.324 --> 39:30.077
I put too much trust in you.

39:30.161 --> 39:32.747
Your ties to S.H.I.E.L.D.
are stronger than you admit.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.750
Leaves me with questions.

39:40.046 --> 39:41.088
No.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.301
You were right to trust me.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.927
I'm finished with S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:48.721 --> 39:52.016
And actually, I have answers.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.809
The DNA you need, I have it.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.269
Inhuman DNA is not enough.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.354
We needed to drain actual Kree blood.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.732
Which is what I have
pumping through my veins.

39:59.815 --> 40:03.611
Coulson used it to bring me back
after Quinn shot me.

40:03.694 --> 40:04.945
Ward should remember.

40:07.073 --> 40:08.324
He does.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.410
So, if you want
this experiment to work...

40:13.370 --> 40:14.663
Drain me.
