There's a beauty to this world.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.845

00:13.680 --> 00:15.932
That's what we like to believe.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.686
We're not wrong.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.354
There is an order.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.064
A grand design.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.650
We made sure of that.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.780
It was a dream for so long,
and we finally made it real.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.617

00:35.744 --> 00:36.911

the look on his face.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.916

00:42.000 --> 00:43.668

00:43.752 --> 00:45.128

00:46.212 --> 00:47.797

00:47.881 --> 00:49.007
(AGNES CHUCKLES)

00:49.090 --> 00:51.426
And I said to him, "Mr. Mayor,
there have always been

00:51.509 --> 00:52.844
two types of people
in this world,

00:52.927 --> 00:55.013

more than anyone.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.192

01:07.275 --> 01:08.610
It's always been that way.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.819
Two worlds.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.571
And frankly,
better us than them.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.784
What does it matter if a system
is meritocratic

01:15.867 --> 01:16.993

01:17.076 --> 01:18.953

of being ruled

01:19.037 --> 01:21.289

01:21.372 --> 01:22.957

01:23.041 --> 01:25.418

in charge earned their place.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.338
And you?

01:28.421 --> 01:30.507
Do you feel like you earned it?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.759
I had some help. No question.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.552

01:35.220 --> 01:36.971

I mean, you're right here

01:44.562 --> 01:47.774
I've been asking myself that
question for a very long time.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.486
Did I really play
any part in it?

01:51.569 --> 01:54.489
Or am I just the sum total
of my code?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.992
Am I just fooling myself...

01:59.869 --> 02:00.870

02:01.621 --> 02:03.289
What does that mean?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.041
You deserve everything
you've got.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.293

02:49.669 --> 02:51.254

02:52.005 --> 02:53.006

02:53.089 --> 02:55.717

02:55.800 --> 02:58.678

I want to you.
