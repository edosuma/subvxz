WEBVTT

00:59.711 --> 01:01.191
- Yo, you good, bro?

01:01.235 --> 01:02.671
Drew, you okay man?

01:02.714 --> 01:03.498
- Yeah.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.847
- Are you sure, man?

01:04.890 --> 01:05.935
I can pull over
if you need me to.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.024
- No, I'm good, bro.

01:09.591 --> 01:10.287
Crazy dream.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.292
It looks so different out here.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.730
- It's not that
different at all, man.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.037
I mean, we got some new
houses and new schools,

01:21.081 --> 01:23.170
but that's pretty much it, bro.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.391
It's good to have you back home,

01:28.349 --> 01:29.437
and in one piece, man.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.832
Drew, we was worried about
you for a few days man.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.140
- I was worried for a few days.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.448
It's only by the grace of
God that I'm still here.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.580
- Yo, it got that
crazy out there?

01:46.410 --> 01:47.846
- Yeah, it got pretty crazy.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.981
- How come you never
said anything, man?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.637
- I didn't want pops
to stress too much.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.942
So I kept some of it to myself.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.468
We could talk about this later.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.600
Man, I'm home.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.167
- Yeah, you home.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.648
And we definitely gonna finish
this conversation later.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.650
I ain't letting you off
the hook that easy, bro.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.130
-  All right.

02:10.173 --> 02:10.826
- Anyway, man.

02:12.349 --> 02:15.483
Pops made a special
dinner for you.

02:17.180 --> 02:17.789
Yeah, buddy.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.011
So let's go be a family.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.407
-  Let's go be a family.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.193
-  Surprise!

02:36.112 --> 02:37.200
- Welcome home, son.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.123
- Are we done hugging
yet, 'cause I'm hungry!

02:50.257 --> 02:53.042
- All right, come on, let's eat.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.054
- Thank you, thank all of you.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.361
I cannot tell you how much

03:07.404 --> 03:08.971
I really appreciate all of this.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.758
I haven't seen a meal like
this in almost a year.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.935
- Baby boy, it is my pleasure.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.895
I'm just glad to see
you back home again.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.505
- Yeah, it's good to
have you back, Drew.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.376
- We really missed you.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.812
- I missed you all too.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.510
- I hope you're
here for a while.

03:26.554 --> 03:29.252
- You don't have to
leave at 08, do you?

03:29.296 --> 03:30.340
- No, actually, I don't
have to leave again.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.734
I got what they call
an Honorable Discharge.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.736
- What does Honorable
Discharge mean?

03:34.779 --> 03:37.652
- Well, in this case it
means I did a great job,

03:37.695 --> 03:39.784
but unfortunately, I got hurt,

03:39.828 --> 03:41.395
so I get to come home early.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.223
- How did you get hurt?

03:43.266 --> 03:46.138
- See, this is why we
need a kid's table.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.707
Let the boy breathe
before we get into

03:49.751 --> 03:50.665
all this heavy stuff.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.233
- I'm sorry, Drew.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.409
- No, it's okay, Keke.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.889
So, what you been up to?

03:57.933 --> 03:59.064
What did I miss?

03:59.108 --> 04:00.283
- You missed everything.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.285
I joined the Girl
Scouts a few months ago,

04:02.329 --> 04:03.721
and already I've
sold more cookies

04:03.765 --> 04:05.854
than any other girl in
the entire district.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.812
- Yeah, that's because
you got mom to harass

04:07.856 --> 04:09.727
all of her coworkers
to buy those cookies.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.512
Mom did all the work.

04:11.555 --> 04:12.687
- I still helped.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.297
- You ate more
cookies than you sold.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.213
-  Anyway,
haters gonna hate.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.216
- So, Jordan, what
you been up to?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.262
- I joined the dance
team at school.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.785
-  You
said dance team,

04:23.828 --> 04:25.090
you joined a dance team?

04:25.134 --> 04:26.440
I didn't even know
you had rhythm.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.702
- Exactly!

04:27.745 --> 04:29.225
- I've been taking
dance classes.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.315
- Yeah, we went to one
of his talent shows,

04:32.359 --> 04:34.012
the boy's pretty good.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.363
Go ahead, show your cousin
some of those moves.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.277
- Right now?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.495
- Right now.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.236
If you don't dance,
you don't eat.

04:41.585 --> 04:42.804
- Do that one where
you pump your fist

04:42.847 --> 04:44.240
in the air, like this.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.285
I like that one.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.073
- No, no, no, that's not it.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.901
Do the whole thing.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.294
- Go ahead, Usher.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.251
Do the whole thing.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.253
- But I don't have any music.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.210
- Theo.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.734
- Yes sir?
- Give the boy a beat.

04:59.777 --> 05:00.691
Something funky.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.649
- Aight, coming right up.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.216
-  Oh, they
put you on the spot.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.218
- Oh, I gotta see this.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.002
Come on.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.612
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan!

05:10.179 --> 05:11.963
- Okay, okay.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.051
Feast your eyes.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.707
-  Jordan, Jordan, Jordan!

05:21.625 --> 05:22.974
- There you go!

05:23.018 --> 05:24.846
That's how you do it, man.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.108
That's how you do it.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.284
Hey now, can you
do the Running Man?

05:31.418 --> 05:34.899
-  Go Jordan,
go Jordan, go Jordan!

05:34.943 --> 05:36.161
- Aw.

05:36.205 --> 05:39.164
Okay, dinner's ready, everyone.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.818
- Can I help you
with that, Auntie?

05:40.862 --> 05:42.429
- Can you go grab
the rest of the food

05:42.472 --> 05:43.908
out of the kitchen then?

05:43.952 --> 05:44.909
Thank you.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.302
- As usually, Sis.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.043
Everything looks delicious.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.218
-  Thank you.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.567
- Everyone, grab a hand.

05:56.181 --> 05:59.446
Father God, creator of
the heavens and Earth,

05:59.489 --> 06:02.710
first and foremost,
thank you for

06:02.753 --> 06:06.540
bringing my son home
safe and in one piece.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.804
And thank you for
his brothers in arms

06:09.847 --> 06:14.548
who had his back in some
very dangerous places.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.855
Thank you for the
brave men and women

06:17.899 --> 06:21.642
who continue to
protect our country.

06:21.685 --> 06:25.341
Thank you for family and friends

06:25.385 --> 06:28.779
who are always there when
you need them the most.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.782
And thank you for
this wonderful food

06:31.826 --> 06:36.439
that my sister was so
gracious in preparing.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.268
Bless it so that it
does our bodies good.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.051
Amen.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.662
-  Amen!

06:41.705 --> 06:43.794
- All right, what
are we waiting for?

06:43.838 --> 06:44.839
Dig in.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.315
- Come on man,
you can't stop me.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.011
Oh, oh.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.362
Oh, oh, oh!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.328
- Nice try, Officer.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.416
You trying to go again?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.548
-  No, thanks.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.027
I've schooled you enough
for today, I think.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.638
- More like been schooled
enough for today.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.252
- Let me give you a hand.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.035
You all right?

07:51.079 --> 07:51.906
- Yeah, perfect.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.081
Never better.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.648
Stay in school, say no to drugs.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.389
- Don't do drugs?

07:57.433 --> 07:58.478
Very original.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.009
- How are we supposed to look
like cool police officers

08:08.052 --> 08:10.359
if you're out here falling
down all over the place?

08:10.402 --> 08:12.622
- I'm just trying to
interact with the community.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.668
- Looks like you're trying to
interact with the pavement.

08:14.711 --> 08:15.799
- Jokes.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.540
Again with the jokes.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.499
You know, I've been taken
a few spills out there,

08:19.542 --> 08:20.412
but I'm getting to
know as many people

08:20.456 --> 08:22.153
in this neighborhood as I can.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.111
- I get it.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.460
I get what you're trying to do,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.201
but you don't want to
look like you're trying.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.637
- Does it look like
I'm trying too hard?

08:27.681 --> 08:28.943
- A little bit.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.727
However, it's good to try hard.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.774
But you don't want to look
like you're trying too hard.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.427
- I'm confused.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.777
- That's all right, kid.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.301
You're still new on the
job, you'll pick it up.

08:39.344 --> 08:39.997
Here you go.

08:40.998 --> 08:41.956
Have a coffee.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.359
- Hey!

08:55.752 --> 08:57.362
- How are you, sir?

08:57.406 --> 08:58.146
Good to see you.

08:58.189 --> 08:58.842
- Oh!

08:59.930 --> 09:01.541
Look who the cat dragged in!

09:01.584 --> 09:03.194
- Long time no see.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.545
- Mitchell, welcome home.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.677
- Feels good to be back
on American soil I'll bet.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.200
- Yes, it does.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.375
- Hey, welcome home kid.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.639
- Thank you, sir.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.466
- Gentlemen, enjoy.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.817
- Thank you.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.166
Hey, now that you're back,

09:18.209 --> 09:20.864
and you have all the
time in the world,

09:20.908 --> 09:22.344
what are you gonna
do with yourself?

09:22.387 --> 09:23.867
- I have a couple things
that I'm working on.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.390
And I'm looking
forward to getting back

09:25.434 --> 09:26.653
to the after school program,

09:26.696 --> 09:28.306
and another little
something me and the guys

09:28.350 --> 09:29.481
have been working on.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.526
- And the girl.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.701
I helped too.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.880
- What's this little
something ya'll talking about?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.665
- Are we allowed
to talk about it?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.014
I haven't really
told anybody yet.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.406
- No time like the present, bro.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.061
- Drew?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.934
- Well, we're looking to expand
the after school program.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.239
We've been trying to get a grant

09:48.283 --> 09:49.763
so we can open up
our own facility

09:49.806 --> 09:51.547
and get some new equipment.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.550
- When did you find
time to chase grants?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.769
- Well, when we weren't
out chasing bad guys,

09:55.812 --> 09:57.640
I had some down time.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.468
But Tracy and Christopher,

09:59.511 --> 10:01.470
they've been spearheading
the whole thing.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.429
- Are you planning on keeping it

10:04.473 --> 10:05.561
in this neighborhood?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.867
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.564
We want to focus
all of our efforts

10:08.608 --> 10:10.044
right here in this area

10:10.087 --> 10:11.436
because we believe if you
can change the community,

10:11.480 --> 10:12.612
you can change the city.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.657
- That's brilliant!

10:16.006 --> 10:18.705
How am I just now
hearing about this?

10:18.748 --> 10:19.880
- Pops, it's still kind of new,

10:19.923 --> 10:22.752
and we're working out
the kinks, but you know,

10:22.796 --> 10:24.798
this is the direction
that we're heading in.

10:24.841 --> 10:25.581
- That's good, man.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
I'm happy for you.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.846
It's good to come home with
a purpose already laid out.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.370
- Yeah, that's a blessing.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.937
I mean, when I came
back from deployment

10:33.981 --> 10:35.635
it took me almost a year

10:35.678 --> 10:37.637
before I found
something productive.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.681
- Oh, come on, Pops,

10:38.725 --> 10:39.987
you know I got my
brother's back.

10:40.030 --> 10:40.901
You know I ain't gonna
let you come home

10:40.944 --> 10:42.076
with nothing to do, man!

10:44.034 --> 10:46.515
- I'm happy for you guys,
I'm happy for all of you.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.562
You guys may just make something
of yourselves after all.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.829
- Wait a minute!

10:55.872 --> 10:58.658
Side bar, where's the cake?

10:58.701 --> 11:01.486
I can smell it, I
just can't see it.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.227
- It is right here.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.489
Come on and help yourself.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.623
- Look at God.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.798
Won't he do it?

11:08.842 --> 11:09.669
-  Yes he will!

11:14.456 --> 11:15.675
- What do you think they see

11:17.154 --> 11:19.069
when they see us patrolling
their neighborhood?

11:19.113 --> 11:20.331
- Well, when they see me,

11:20.375 --> 11:22.899
they see a ruggedly
handsome man of the law.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.554
- Nah, that's not what I mean.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.643
- I'm just messing with
ya, I know what you mean.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.210
You're talking about perception.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.646
- Yeah.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.736
- Well, we're two
white police officers

11:33.780 --> 11:36.217
patrolling a predominantly
black neighborhood.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.827
Neither of us actually
lives in this neighborhood,

11:37.871 --> 11:39.481
you live a bit closer than I do,

11:39.524 --> 11:41.309
but neither of us
actually lives here.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.703
We don't have any friends, we
don't have any family here,

11:43.746 --> 11:46.618
but yet we're here,
every single day.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.838
How do you think
we're perceived?

11:48.882 --> 11:49.491
Watch you.

11:50.884 --> 11:54.191
- Hopefully we're perceived
as the good guys, right?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.932
- Hopefully as the
good guys, huh?

11:55.976 --> 11:56.672
Why the good guys?

11:57.891 --> 11:59.936
- I mean, come on.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.504
We're cops, good guys.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.506
- Are you one of the
good guys, Officer Tyler?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.204
See that, you hesitated.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.597
Never hesitate,
you have to know.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.295
Are you one of the
good guys, yes or no?

12:11.339 --> 12:12.253
- Yes.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.907
Yes, I'm one of the good guys.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.823
- Listen, stop worrying
about perceptions.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.738
If you let the streets
dictate who you are,

12:18.781 --> 12:20.391
you'd be torn to
shreds out here.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.524
You need to know who
you are from the get go.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.787
Focus on staying one
of the good guys.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.397
And don't think just because
you're wearing that uniform

12:26.441 --> 12:28.573
you're automatically
one of the good guys.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.967
If you were a scumbag
before you put that on,

12:31.011 --> 12:32.882
there's a good chance
you're still a scumbag.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.058
- Nah, I wasn't a scumbag
before, and I'm certainly

12:35.102 --> 12:36.103
not a scumbag now.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.061
You know what I think?

12:38.105 --> 12:40.063
How long have you
been on the force?

12:40.107 --> 12:41.282
- 20 years.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.283
I'm no spring chicken.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.329
- Yeah, well, it's
starting to show.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.983
- What do you mean by that?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.732
- Give us the money,
nobody gets hurt.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.476
Robbery in progress,

13:01.519 --> 13:02.956
5402 West Gellen.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.435
- 1108, in route.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.019
- Throw your weapon down
and get on your knees!

13:23.063 --> 13:24.934
Drop your weapon and
get on your knees!

13:36.206 --> 13:37.817
- Perp has entered
the Bend Building,

13:37.860 --> 13:41.037
following on foot,
14th Street North.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.786
This day can go
really badly for you,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.397
or we can leave here peacefully.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.051
Drop it!

14:45.754 --> 14:47.408
- Not bad, Officer.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.626
Not bad at all.

15:05.034 --> 15:05.905
- Hello?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.950
- Hey, I got some good news.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.604
-  Is it about the grant?

15:09.647 --> 15:10.910
- You know it.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.260
So, my dad, he
called in this favor

15:13.303 --> 15:14.914
from one of his friends,

15:14.957 --> 15:17.133
this super rich tech shark
he used to do business with

15:17.177 --> 15:18.743
a few years ago.

15:18.787 --> 15:21.442
He told him about what
we're trying to do,

15:21.485 --> 15:24.097
and he got us a meeting
with him on Monday.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.925
He wants to hear
about us, the kids,

15:25.968 --> 15:27.839
the after school
program, the whole deal.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.624
- Dude, are you for real?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.843
- Seriously, this is for real.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.933
It looks like Drew came
home at the perfect time.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.108
- Yo, he's gonna go bananas.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.023
This is perfect timing.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.981
Are we prepared for
a meeting, Chris?

15:39.025 --> 15:41.244
- If not, we better
get prepared.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.942
And keep in mind,
these rich guys,

15:42.985 --> 15:43.986
they need tax write offs.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.074
- Right, right.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.771
- We may be helping
out his business.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.077
We just have to tell
him what we've been

15:48.121 --> 15:49.861
trying to do these
past few years.

15:49.905 --> 15:50.906
We could do that, right?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.864
- We can definitely do that.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.257
Yo, we know this
thing inside out.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.824
- Exactly.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.913
This should be a piece of cake.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.002
So what are you
guys up to today?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.264
- Um, we're gonna head out.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.527
I'm taking Drew to
look for an apartment

16:03.571 --> 16:05.138
and a new car.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.053
- I guess he must be anxious
to get back out there.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.924
- Yeah man, it's like
he went in there a boy

16:08.968 --> 16:10.404
and he came out a man.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.666
He wants to get his own place,

16:11.709 --> 16:13.146
he wants to get a job,

16:13.189 --> 16:15.670
he wants to get a car, he wants
to hit the ground running.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.107
- I hear the military
will do that to you.

16:18.151 --> 16:21.110
Well listen, I'm only about
10 minutes away from you guys.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.634
I'll swing by,
I'll scoop you up,

16:23.678 --> 16:24.592
and we can ride together.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.985
- Sounds good.

16:26.028 --> 16:26.986
I'll let you tell
him the good news.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.596
I'll see you when you get here.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.164
Aight.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.253
- Six, seven, eight, nine.

16:57.886 --> 16:58.539
It's open.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.672
- You about ready?

17:01.716 --> 17:02.586
- I just have to
jump in the shower,

17:02.630 --> 17:03.544
it'll take me five minutes.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.371
- Cool.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.285
Yo, Chris is coming by.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.590
We're gonna ride with him,

17:06.634 --> 17:07.722
then we're gonna head
to the dealership first

17:07.765 --> 17:09.332
and then go grab a bite to eat.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.638
- Cool, sounds like a plan.

17:11.943 --> 17:12.944
I really appreciate you guys

17:12.988 --> 17:14.859
taking care of me like this.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.992
- Come on, bro, I
told you we got you.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.908
And you should probably
go get in the shower,

17:19.951 --> 17:20.996
you got this whole
room smelling like

17:21.040 --> 17:22.128
cheese and gym socks.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.172
You stink, bro!

17:23.216 --> 17:24.347
- Get out of here, man.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.967
- I'm just trying to
help you out, bruh.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.273
- Get out, get out!

17:45.934 --> 17:47.675
- There he is, the golden boy.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.024
- Oh, there he is!

17:54.682 --> 17:56.553
- Golden boy.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.380
- I know.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.167
- Thank you, thank
you, too kind.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.213
- You finally got a
taste of what it's like

18:04.257 --> 18:05.606
to be out on the street.

18:05.649 --> 18:09.218
- Yeah, it was pretty intense.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.002
I'm just glad I didn't flinch.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.308
- Flinch yet.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.136
It can get pretty
scary out there,

18:14.180 --> 18:16.834
but yesterday was
a good test though.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.489
- Listen, flinching is the
least of your worries, kid.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.751
Let me tell you something,

18:20.795 --> 18:23.145
I've seen grown
men poop themselves

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
first week on the job.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.062
What you did out there,
that took courage,

18:27.106 --> 18:29.369
and don't let anybody tell
you anything different.

18:30.587 --> 18:31.893
- Okay, okay.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.242
This kid's head's
big enough already.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.331
Calm down with the platitudes.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.941
We gonna eat or we gonna
spend the rest of the day

18:36.985 --> 18:37.725
patting each other on the back?

18:37.768 --> 18:39.030
- We gon' eat.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.467
- Come on, man.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.033
He did good, give
the man his props.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.426
-  Thank you.

18:43.470 --> 18:44.993
- Don't fill his
head up too much.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.038
We got lucky out
there the other day.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.127
That guy decided to run,

18:48.170 --> 18:50.564
it doesn't always
play out like that.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.174
- No, it sure don't.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.829
A good day can turn into a
nightmare at the drop of a hat.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.222
- Why you trying
to scare the guy?

18:56.265 --> 18:57.397
- Hey, I'm just
trying to give the kid

18:57.440 --> 18:59.181
an honest point of view.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.184
Hope for the best, but always
be prepared for the worst.

19:02.228 --> 19:02.967
Always.

19:03.011 --> 19:03.664
-  Absolutely.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.672
- You know it bro, you know it.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.676
- Tracy just texted me, I
told her to meet us here

19:15.719 --> 19:17.460
because our boy Chris
has some important news

19:17.504 --> 19:19.549
to share with the group.
- You got some good news?

19:19.593 --> 19:20.681
- Yup, I do.

19:20.724 --> 19:21.856
But we gotta wait for Tracy,

19:21.899 --> 19:23.118
because it concerns her too.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.511
- Is it that important?

19:24.554 --> 19:26.121
- Yup, it's that important.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.906
- Hey, I don't know about
ya'll, but I am hungry, man.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.125
- Man, your default is hunger.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.431
-  Whatever.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.041
- I don't think I
know another person

19:33.084 --> 19:34.477
who eats as much as you!
- Yes you do, our dad, man,

19:34.521 --> 19:36.000
he eats like an elephant, bro.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.525
Hey, Grace, what's up?

19:38.568 --> 19:39.439
- Hey, Grace!

19:39.482 --> 19:40.440
- Drew!

19:40.483 --> 19:41.789
Welcome back.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.138
When did you get in?

19:43.182 --> 19:43.878
-  I just
got in yesterday.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.358
So good to see you!

19:45.401 --> 19:46.794
-  How come you guys
didn't tell me he was here?

19:46.837 --> 19:48.274
- No, don't look at me, don't.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.318
- Anyway...

19:49.362 --> 19:51.190
It's
good to see you too.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.801
- So, what you been up
to while I was gone?

19:53.844 --> 19:58.109
- Finishing up high school,
applying and touring colleges,

19:58.153 --> 20:00.024
that's pretty much been my life.

20:00.068 --> 20:03.071
I guess it paid off though,
I got accepted into USF,

20:03.114 --> 20:04.333
the music and art program.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.335
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Grace.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.249
- That's great news.
- Way to go, girl.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.163
- Thank you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.208
I really couldn't have done it

20:09.251 --> 20:10.905
without you guys and Tracy.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.602
The after school program
helped to keep me focused

20:12.646 --> 20:13.908
and out of trouble.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.214
- Grace, you were
already awesome.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.127
Now, we may have
helped you channel

20:16.171 --> 20:17.955
all of that energy and effort,

20:17.999 --> 20:20.001
but as far as the
elements of greatness,

20:20.044 --> 20:21.132
it was already there.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.308
- Well, thanks to you.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.700
-  You are welcome.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.006
- Now let me get your guys'
order before my other job.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.703
What can
I get for you, Chris?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.314
-  Can I get a
Coke with lots of ice?

20:28.357 --> 20:30.054
- I want a vanilla
shake, please.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.840
- Just a glass of
water for me, thanks.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.320
- Okay, all right.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.409
I'll get those out to
you in just a second.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.628
Give you a couple of minutes
to look over the menus.

20:38.672 --> 20:39.847
-  Thanks, Grace.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.065
- Good seeing you too.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.198
- Good seeing you,
Grace, good seeing you.

20:43.242 --> 20:43.981
- Isn't she awesome?

20:44.025 --> 20:44.808
- That was pretty cool.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.462
- Yeah, bro, it was.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.334
- Hey, I gotta ask you.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.857
Who were those two older
gentlemen at your party?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.294
I thought I knew everybody.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.035
- The man with the one
leg was Tim Mitchell,

20:54.078 --> 20:56.124
and the other gentleman
was Hector Diaz.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.734
They served with our
dad in the Gulf War.

20:57.778 --> 20:58.692
Tim lost his leg there,

20:58.735 --> 21:00.302
they're all in the same unit.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.738
- How'd he lose it?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.305
- RPG.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.480
The unit was pinned down
in what they thought

21:04.524 --> 21:06.221
was a safe zone,

21:06.265 --> 21:07.962
in the middle of a firefight
with a group of insurgents.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.311
About a half an hour goes by

21:09.355 --> 21:10.530
and the firing slow
was just enough

21:10.573 --> 21:12.183
for them to take cover
in a nearby building.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.489
Turns out it was a trap.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.012
- Yeah.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.318
- RPG comes flying
through one of the windows

21:16.362 --> 21:17.580
and goes off just
yards away from Tim.

21:17.624 --> 21:18.625
Rips his leg right off.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.191
- Clean off.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.802
- Hector and our dad managed
to pull him to safety.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.457
They were all pretty
banged up but Tim,

21:24.500 --> 21:25.632
Tim caught the worst of it.

21:25.675 --> 21:26.981
- Mhm.

21:27.024 --> 21:27.764
- Really?

21:27.808 --> 21:28.591
- For real.

21:28.635 --> 21:29.375
- That is crazy.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.941
-  I know, bro.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.639
- Man, that sounds like right
out of "Black Hawk Down"

21:32.682 --> 21:34.902
or some "Saving Private
Ryan" kind of stuff.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.251
-  I know!

21:36.295 --> 21:37.644
- After hearing how
dangerous it was,

21:37.687 --> 21:39.254
you still wanted to enlist?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.647
- Well at first, not really.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.039
But after 9/11, I felt I had to.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.259
I had to do something.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.827
And a part of me wanted to
follow my dad's footsteps.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.132
- And what about you, Theo?

21:48.176 --> 21:49.438
How come you never enlisted?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.005
- Simple answer, bro.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.528
'Cause I don't want nobody
shooting at me, man.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.356
You already know, man.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.139
- I get that.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.489
- Hey Tracy, what's up?

21:56.532 --> 21:57.707
- What's up, Tracy?
- Come on in, come on in.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.405
Have a seat, have a seat.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.232
- Nothing yet, we just sat down.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.843
- Am I the only one who
doesn't know about this?

22:02.886 --> 22:05.149
- They haven't told me either.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.238
Okay, so, spit it out.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.328
- Yeah, come on, the
suspense is killing me.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.287
- You want to tell?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.245
- Nah bro, you gotta drop
that good news on them.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.725
- All right.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.597
So, I told my dad about the
after school program, right?

22:17.640 --> 22:21.035
So he tells one of his friends,

22:21.078 --> 22:23.298
and that friend loves
what we're doing.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.387
And that friend
also happens to be

22:25.431 --> 22:28.651
a multi-millionaire and wants
to meet with us on Monday.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.481
- Are you for real?

22:32.525 --> 22:33.395
- This is amazing.
- Yes, bro!

22:33.439 --> 22:35.049
- This could change everything.

22:35.092 --> 22:35.832
- Everything, man.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.400
- Come here.
- You gonna hug him?

22:38.444 --> 22:39.314
- Come here.
- Nah.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.446
- I'm gonna give you a hug.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.708
- No hug necessary, man!
- Hug him!

22:41.751 --> 22:42.622
-  This deserves a hug.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.232
-  I'm telling you!

22:48.367 --> 22:49.846
- And that's exactly why we need

22:49.890 --> 22:50.804
to get drugs off the street.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.153
- Yeah, you're right about it.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.547
- I'm just playing, but really,

22:54.590 --> 22:55.417
they look like they just won
the lottery or something.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.244
-  They do.

22:56.287 --> 22:56.853
- Yeah, yeah.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.301
- I'm nervous.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.825
I think I look nervous.

23:11.868 --> 23:12.521
Do I look nervous?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.524
- You're fine,
stop stressing it.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.398
- When I get
nervous, I get gassy.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.488
I think I'm gonna
use the restroom

23:22.531 --> 23:23.314
before the meeting.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.533
- Are you okay?

23:26.448 --> 23:29.320
- I'm just nervous, I
gotta go to the restroom.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.887
-  Christopher?

23:30.931 --> 23:32.323
Mr. Townsend will see you now.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.064
- Yes.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.588
- Are you okay?

23:35.631 --> 23:36.980
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.373
Perfect, never better.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.393
- Please take a seat,

23:58.437 --> 24:00.090
Mr. Townsend will
be with you shortly.

24:00.134 --> 24:04.965
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.281
- Everybody okay?

24:19.719 --> 24:21.155
Don't be nervous.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.127
- Pardon my tardiness.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.912
I had another meeting that
ran a little bit late.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.957
You must be Christopher,
nice to meet you.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.306
- It's nice to meet
you, Mr. Townsend.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.090
- Call me Eric.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.308
- I'm Tracy.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.309
- Nice to meet you, Tracy.

24:45.353 --> 24:46.920
- I'm Drew.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.748
- Strong handshake, I like that.

24:49.705 --> 24:50.619
- I'm Theo.

24:50.663 --> 24:51.315
- Theo.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.972
I can't help but notice that
you seem a bit perturbed.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.932
- No, I was just
expecting someone--

24:58.975 --> 24:59.889
- Someone older?

24:59.933 --> 25:01.587
- Yeah, yeah, somebody older.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.414
- It's okay, I take
that as a compliment,

25:03.458 --> 25:04.633
I get it a lot.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.330
So let's get down to business.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.768
I heard you all were working
on something pretty special.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.378
- Yes.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.814
We've put together this really
cool after school program

25:11.858 --> 25:14.643
for inner city kids,
kids in our community.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.819
Right now, we're focused
on music and art,

25:16.863 --> 25:17.951
and we're in desperate need

25:17.994 --> 25:20.301
of some new instruments
and supplies.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.216
We'd also like to purchase
a dedicated facility

25:22.259 --> 25:23.870
so we can broaden our efforts.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.654
That's where you come in.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.656
- I like what I'm hearing so
far. You got five minutes.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.528
Break it down to me as
if I was a five year old.

25:29.571 --> 25:32.661
- Our after school program
is called Clear Path.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.097
As Drew mentioned,
we're in desperate need

25:34.141 --> 25:36.578
of new instruments
in our own facility.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.145
Right now we're renting
space from the school

25:38.188 --> 25:39.625
that many of the
kids already attend,

25:39.668 --> 25:40.930
but what we'd like to do

25:40.974 --> 25:42.323
is create a fresh,
new environment

25:42.366 --> 25:43.933
for the kids we
already work with,

25:43.977 --> 25:45.500
and have something big
enough to accommodate

25:45.544 --> 25:46.414
even more kids.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.721
- How many kids do you have now,

25:48.764 --> 25:51.724
and how many have
completed so far?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.291
- Right now we have
about 60 kids enrolled,

25:54.335 --> 25:56.642
ranged from ages eight to 16.

25:56.685 --> 25:59.122
We've been in operation
for about six years,

25:59.166 --> 26:03.605
and in that six years, 485 kids
have graduated our program.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.955
- You average 80 kids a year

26:05.999 --> 26:07.653
with such a small team?

26:07.696 --> 26:09.698
- Yes, and I was deployed
for about a year,

26:09.742 --> 26:11.657
and so the team
was even smaller,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.659
and they still held it down.

26:13.702 --> 26:16.531
- Impressive to say the least.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.185
And you're a veteran, right?

26:18.228 --> 26:19.578
- Yes, sir.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.667
Two years in total with
one year of active duty.

26:21.710 --> 26:22.798
- You're like the poster boy

26:22.842 --> 26:25.453
for everything great
about this country.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.628
- Thank you, sir.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.587
But I don't want to
make this about me.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.979
This is about the
kids that we serve

26:30.023 --> 26:31.807
and how we can
hopefully work together

26:31.851 --> 26:33.069
to continue to serve them.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.420
- Wow.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.162
Honestly, you had me at hello.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.164
Chris, as soon as your
dad told me about this

26:41.208 --> 26:42.731
I wanted to be a part of it.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.951
A war veteran returning
home to serve his community.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.517
It's perfect.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.650
I do have one concern though.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.566
I don't know any of you.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.741
I don't know how
committed you are

26:52.785 --> 26:55.701
to the success of the
program or the kids.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.051
I hear what you're telling
me and it sounds great,

26:58.094 --> 27:00.575
but what connects
you all through this?

27:00.619 --> 27:03.317
Why should I trust you for
the next five to 10 years?

27:06.015 --> 27:11.020
- Eric, I've spent the
last six years of my life

27:11.064 --> 27:14.589
working in this
program with children.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.331
I didn't know a thing
about teaching kids.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.985
So I started taking classes

27:19.028 --> 27:21.901
on how to teach kids while
I was teaching the kids.

27:23.729 --> 27:27.471
We started this program
with just four instruments

27:27.515 --> 27:29.256
that were given to
us by our mother,

27:30.518 --> 27:32.389
who passed away a few years ago.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.524
I've personally invested
at least $10,000

27:36.567 --> 27:39.396
in new instruments,
art supplies,

27:39.440 --> 27:43.357
and the upkeep of the
facilities that we use.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.272
Tracy have written
letter after letter

27:45.315 --> 27:47.361
to every grant
issuing organization

27:47.404 --> 27:48.841
that you could think of.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.278
She's traveled the country
trying to find grant money

27:51.321 --> 27:53.976
or someone to invest
in our program,

27:54.020 --> 27:55.282
and she's doing all of this

27:55.325 --> 27:57.458
while teaching
five vocal classes,

27:57.501 --> 27:59.547
and pretty much running
day to day operations.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.551
Chris has been
here since day one.

28:05.118 --> 28:08.251
We taught our first
music class together.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.775
And he's structuring
the curriculum

28:09.818 --> 28:11.037
in the way that our classes

28:11.080 --> 28:13.692
are now official
college credits.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.698
But it was my brother
Drew who started it all.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.787
It was his idea to
offer our talents

28:21.830 --> 28:22.526
to the community.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.617
He was away for one
year on the battlefield,

28:26.661 --> 28:28.010
and while he was away,

28:28.054 --> 28:32.319
he was donating his entire
salary to this program.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.103
We're married to this.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.583
But we've gone as
far as we can go

28:35.626 --> 28:37.759
with our knowledge
and resources.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.849
We need your help to be
able to offer more classes

28:40.893 --> 28:42.503
to more students,
reach more people.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.680
We need you, Eric.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.597
You are the missing piece, sir.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.409
- We did it!

29:19.453 --> 29:21.150
- We did it, we did it!

29:25.938 --> 29:27.809
- We gotta celebrate
guys, we gotta celebrate.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.071
This is bananas.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.377
- Did you have that
speech written?

29:30.420 --> 29:31.465
You couldn't come up
with that on that fly.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.640
- Right then and there bro.

29:32.683 --> 29:33.423
- Man, stop it!

29:33.467 --> 29:34.250
No you didn't.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.556
- Honest truth, man.

29:35.599 --> 29:36.905
It was all off the
top of my head.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.907
Guys, I feel like a huge
weight has been lifted.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.691
- We gotta go
celebrate, this is huge.

29:40.735 --> 29:41.823
- We gotta celebrate, come on!

29:42.955 --> 29:44.434
So what did you think, Drew?

29:44.478 --> 29:46.088
You think we got it, man?

29:46.132 --> 29:47.350
- I think we did it.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.091
I think we may have
gotten it, bro.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.485
- I think this is it, Drew.
I think this is our big break

29:51.528 --> 29:52.921
we've been waiting for, man.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.053
- This is more than what
we've been waiting for.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.097
This is our big chance.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.316
We just may have it.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.146
- I think we're
getting pulled over.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.365
Did you run a stop sign there?

30:02.409 --> 30:03.714
Make this next right, Drew.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.196
We don't need this, man.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.090
-  Are you aware you made
an illegal turn back there?

30:31.133 --> 30:33.657
You're supposed to come to
a complete stop at the sign.

30:33.701 --> 30:34.876
License and registration.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.747
- Absolutely, give me a second.

30:36.791 --> 30:37.748
- I got it, I got it.

30:43.711 --> 30:44.799
- Ya'll all right back there?

30:44.843 --> 30:45.495
- Yes, ma'am.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.717
- You too?

30:49.760 --> 30:50.500
- Yeah, thanks.

30:50.544 --> 30:51.153
- You sure?

30:54.461 --> 30:55.897
All right.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.420
Give me a second,
I'll be right back.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.598
- Man, what was that all about?

31:02.817 --> 31:03.949
- I don't know, man.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.428
Look like she was
looking for something.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.256
- Your license and
registration is good, right?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.083
- Yeah, always.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.519
- You sure?

31:09.563 --> 31:10.912
- Yeah.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.784
- My eyes are looking
crazy, aren't they?

31:13.828 --> 31:14.568
- Yeah.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.267
She's gonna think
you're high, or worse.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.313
- Maybe we kidnapped
her or something.

31:20.356 --> 31:21.140
-  Bro.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.402
- Come on.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.577
- Stop playing
around, all right?

31:23.620 --> 31:24.839
Don't joke like that, chill.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.406
Just make sure
you put your hands

31:26.449 --> 31:27.407
on the steering wheel
when she comes back

31:27.450 --> 31:28.495
so she can see them.

31:30.714 --> 31:31.759
Please.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.067
- His license and
registration's all good,

31:35.110 --> 31:37.156
but something's up with
that girl in the back seat.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.505
- What do you mean?

31:38.548 --> 31:40.376
- I mean her eyes
are all bloodshot

31:40.420 --> 31:41.725
and she seems off, you know?

31:41.769 --> 31:43.292
And the guy sitting next to her

31:43.336 --> 31:44.206
is clutching the backpack

31:44.250 --> 31:45.642
like his life depended on it.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.906
- I don't know, maybe
she just broke up

31:47.949 --> 31:49.733
with her boyfriend or something.

31:49.777 --> 31:51.866
- Yeah, that could be it.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.738
- Or maybe she
just smoked a joint

31:54.782 --> 31:55.870
and the guy in the backseat

31:55.914 --> 31:57.741
has a bag of weed
in his backpack.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.221
- Really?

31:59.265 --> 32:00.266
- Hey, it could happen.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.923
But you know what, the
car that they're driving,

32:04.966 --> 32:06.576
it matches the
description of the car

32:06.620 --> 32:08.056
that was stolen
from Highland Park

32:08.100 --> 32:10.450
like a few weeks ago.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.887
And the guy that's
driving the car,

32:12.931 --> 32:14.236
that dude matched
the description

32:14.280 --> 32:17.109
of the question in question
to the same robbery.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.154
- You really are
trying to make my day

32:19.198 --> 32:21.765
more difficult than it
already is, aren't you?

32:21.809 --> 32:23.158
- Not at all.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.030
I just want you to make
informed decisions, that's it.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.293
- Why thank you for
that information.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.598
- Hey, that's why I'm here.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.339
- I didn't get a
bad vibe from him.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.950
- I don't know, Christine.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.995
If we cut them loose,

32:34.039 --> 32:35.649
and another officer
pulls them over,

32:35.692 --> 32:38.086
only to find out that
she's actually high,

32:38.130 --> 32:40.784
man, we'll be looking
straight crazy out here.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.352
So I say just to be safe,

32:43.396 --> 32:46.703
do a quick search of the
car, just to be sure,

32:46.747 --> 32:48.053
and why you're at it,

32:48.096 --> 32:50.403
tell the driver that
he may want to consider

32:50.446 --> 32:52.796
growing his hair out and
selling that piece of crap.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.235
- I can't stand you.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.453
- Yeah.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.412
Go and check the vehicle.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.068
- Man, what's
taking them so long?

33:03.111 --> 33:04.765
- Relax.

33:04.808 --> 33:07.028
-  She's coming back
now, she's coming back.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.029
- Everybody just...

33:12.729 --> 33:14.949
- Sir, do you have any drugs

33:14.993 --> 33:15.819
or weapons in your car?

33:17.821 --> 33:18.997
- No ma'am, I don't.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.000
I don't do drugs, and I
don't own any weapons.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.305
-  Good.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.568
So, do you mind if
I do a quick search?

33:25.612 --> 33:27.092
- Excuse me, ma'am?

33:27.135 --> 33:28.789
Officer?

33:28.832 --> 33:31.009
We're not criminals or anything.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.402
There's no reason for you
to search our vehicle.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.925
Can you just give us
a ticket or whatever

33:34.969 --> 33:35.883
and let us go?

33:35.926 --> 33:37.232
- This will only take a minute.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.538
The quicker we do this,

33:38.581 --> 33:40.844
the quicker we can
all go home, right?

33:40.888 --> 33:42.542
- Right.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.891
- Excuse me, ma'am.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.980
I'm not trying to
be difficult but,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.851
why do we have to
get out of the car?

33:47.895 --> 33:49.984
Can you just give us a
ticket and let us go?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.160
This doesn't feel good, I
feel like I'm being profiled.

33:52.204 --> 33:52.987
- Profiling?

33:54.075 --> 33:55.424
Ain't nobody
profiling you brother,

33:55.468 --> 33:58.253
I just want to do a
random search, that's it.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.863
- Well I'm sorry, ma'am,

33:59.907 --> 34:01.082
but I'm not giving you
permission to search my car.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.301
You're gonna have
to get a warrant

34:02.344 --> 34:03.432
and let us be on our way,

34:03.476 --> 34:05.260
because we didn't do anything.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.132
- Drew, just give her
permission to check the car

34:07.175 --> 34:08.524
so we can be done
with this, man.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.140
- Honestly sir, if I
have probable cause,

34:15.183 --> 34:18.491
I don't need your permission
to search the car.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.058
I can command you to
get out of the car,

34:20.101 --> 34:22.190
and if you didn't
get out of the car,

34:22.234 --> 34:24.062
I could open the door,
smash the window,

34:24.105 --> 34:25.759
and pull you out of the car.

34:25.802 --> 34:26.803
Don't get it twisted.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.111
All I was gonna do
was a random search,

34:30.155 --> 34:31.504
but you done ticked me off.

34:33.158 --> 34:34.811
You need to stop
looking at every cop

34:34.855 --> 34:36.161
thinking everybody's
out to get you.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.684
You are not that important.

34:37.727 --> 34:38.815
Do you hear me?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.355
You hear me? You don't know
what it's like to be me,

34:56.398 --> 34:59.140
to walk around these streets
wearing this uniform.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.621
You couldn't walk
a day in my shoes.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.666
You think about that next
time you try to be tough

35:03.710 --> 35:04.928
in front of your friends.

35:04.972 --> 35:05.799
- Okay, you know what?

35:05.842 --> 35:07.061
You're right.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.454
I'm sorry, because look at me.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.020
Take a real good look.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.935
Because why would I have
any clue what it's like

35:11.979 --> 35:14.460
for people to judge me
based on my exterior.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.678
Why would I know what it's like

35:15.722 --> 35:17.767
to drive down the
street and feel targeted

35:17.811 --> 35:19.465
because of the way that I look.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.597
You're right, you're 100% right.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.860
Why the heck would I
know what that's like?

35:27.386 --> 35:28.909
- You need to drive off, son.

35:30.650 --> 35:33.218
You need to just drive
off, just drive off, okay?

35:45.926 --> 35:46.579
- Uh, what just
happened out there?

35:49.103 --> 35:50.539
Okay, are you gonna
tell me what happened

35:50.583 --> 35:51.801
or will I have to
write a report--

35:51.845 --> 35:53.151
- I lost my temper, all right?

35:54.804 --> 35:56.154
- You lost your temper?

35:56.197 --> 35:58.112
Christine, you looked
like a maniac out there.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.506
Every ugly thing people
say about police officers,

36:00.549 --> 36:02.203
you just did it!

36:02.247 --> 36:07.208
- That kid just stepped on
every last nerve I had left.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.992
These people don't
know how hard it is

36:09.036 --> 36:10.690
to be a black woman
wearing this uniform

36:10.733 --> 36:11.995
trying to protect and serve.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.519
He couldn't walk
a day in my shoes,

36:13.562 --> 36:15.390
and he's gonna talk
to me like that?

36:19.873 --> 36:21.962
Yes, I know I lost control

36:22.005 --> 36:24.486
of the situation
for a second but--

36:24.530 --> 36:26.532
- We can't do that.

36:26.575 --> 36:27.924
- Do what?

36:27.968 --> 36:29.361
- We can't wear this
badge, this uniform,

36:29.404 --> 36:31.145
and harass people like that.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.582
Christine, it's
an abuse of power.

36:33.626 --> 36:34.714
- Harass people?

36:34.757 --> 36:36.019
Abuse of power, really?

36:37.282 --> 36:38.108
Don't you think
you're stretching this

36:38.152 --> 36:39.153
way out of proportion?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.589
- No.

36:40.633 --> 36:41.982
- And I think you need to
watch how you talk to me.

36:42.025 --> 36:42.896
- Watch how I talk to to you?

36:42.939 --> 36:44.158
- Watch what you say to me.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.203
- Watch how I talk to you?
- Yes.

36:47.901 --> 36:48.902
- Listen, Christine.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.166
What if this was your
daughter out there?

36:52.210 --> 36:54.777
And one of our police
officers pulled her over

36:54.821 --> 36:58.259
and made her feel like
a second class citizen,

36:58.303 --> 37:00.087
and had his hands
all up in her face?

37:02.350 --> 37:04.004
Christine, how would you feel

37:05.179 --> 37:07.050
if it hits closer to home?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.098
You gotta think about that.

37:18.584 --> 37:19.759
-  Hey, you good, bro?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.892
- Yeah I'm good, no big deal.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.067
- Are you sure, man?

37:27.288 --> 37:30.030
- You know, that really
rubbed me the wrong way.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.336
- I get it man, I was
there, I saw what happened.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.338
- Yeah, but that mess
happens way too much.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.427
I'm an American citizen
who fought for this country

37:35.470 --> 37:37.080
and bled for this country,

37:37.124 --> 37:38.386
now I have to come home and
deal with stuff like that.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.474
-  Yo, I get
it man, I get it.

37:39.518 --> 37:40.432
- Bro, something's
wrong with that picture.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.607
- No, I get it.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.435
I agree with you
100%, all right?

37:43.478 --> 37:44.740
But I love you, Drew.

37:44.784 --> 37:45.959
And I don't want to
see you get hemmed up

37:46.002 --> 37:48.309
over no traffic stop.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.005
Okay?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.269
Look, I know you're
not a criminal,

37:51.312 --> 37:52.618
and you know you're
not a criminal,

37:52.661 --> 37:53.880
but next time it happens,

37:53.923 --> 37:56.404
just don't fuss with 'em, Drew.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.276
Cooperate as much as possible.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.368
The goal is to get
home safe, man.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.325
You feel me?

38:04.369 --> 38:06.371
- I feel you, man.

38:06.414 --> 38:07.023
I feel you.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.244
- You sure?

38:10.288 --> 38:10.940
- Yeah.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.379
- Come on, man.

38:14.422 --> 38:15.902
Let's go, I got
a song to finish.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.180
- Bro.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.401
I can't tell you how good
it is to have you back home.

38:36.444 --> 38:39.404
And I don't just
mean for the program,

38:39.447 --> 38:42.885
I mean to have my boy
back on American soil.

38:42.929 --> 38:43.799
- I can't tell
you how good it is

38:43.843 --> 38:45.801
to be back on American soil.

38:45.845 --> 38:46.802
Coming from living in the desert

38:46.846 --> 38:48.848
for almost a year to this,

38:48.891 --> 38:49.588
it's like heaven.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.373
Regardless of what
happened earlier today,

38:52.417 --> 38:55.463
it's still 100 times
better than dodging bullets

38:55.507 --> 38:57.378
in 125 degree weather.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.772
- So what was it like
to be away for so long?

39:01.251 --> 39:02.296
- It was rough.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.561
You're always on
edge, always tense,

39:06.605 --> 39:09.042
always looking
over your shoulder.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.305
Even being on the base
can be pretty scary.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.654
You can hear bombs going off

39:12.698 --> 39:15.483
just a few miles away
from where you sleep.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.311
And the worst part about it

39:17.355 --> 39:19.661
is being away from my friends
and family for so long.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.533
Knowing you could never
get that time back.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.406
After I got shot, it
made it even more real.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.845
I knew I had to come back home.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.499
I felt like I was
knowing on heaven's door.

39:33.283 --> 39:36.504
I made some great friends
while I was there though,

39:36.548 --> 39:37.549
so leaving was bittersweet.

39:38.941 --> 39:39.681
- Wow.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.206
Way to bring
everybody down, bro!

39:43.250 --> 39:44.599
Come on, man!

39:44.643 --> 39:45.905
I'm over here trying to
gobble up this good food,

39:45.948 --> 39:46.819
and you're trying
to make me cry.

39:46.862 --> 39:47.733
That's not a good look, bro!

39:47.776 --> 39:49.038
I can't be over here crying

39:49.082 --> 39:50.736
with a mouth full
of food like ah!

39:51.693 --> 39:52.912
Come on, man.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.218
- But you know what
is a good look?

39:55.262 --> 39:56.132
This.

39:57.569 --> 40:00.441
All of us coming together
to make something awesome.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.487
- What are you thinking, Theo?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.358
I can see the
wheels are turning.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.707
- I'm thinking expansion, Trace.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.056
Look, up until now, right?

40:07.100 --> 40:08.841
We've only been able
to teach art and music.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.103
But once we get this grant,

40:10.146 --> 40:11.539
we'll be able to
offer more classes.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.193
- Like what, what
are you thinking?

40:13.236 --> 40:14.977
- Look, I'm thinking we can
bring on some new instructors,

40:15.021 --> 40:16.849
add a math class,
an English class,

40:16.892 --> 40:17.937
even a dance class.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.329
- That sounds good.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.983
- I'm down with that too.

40:21.027 --> 40:24.247
And if we're gonna offer
hip hop, I got it covered.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.249
There is no reason to
look for an instructor.

40:26.293 --> 40:27.425
- Huh?

40:27.468 --> 40:28.861
- What?

40:28.904 --> 40:30.689
- Not trying to be
petty or anything,

40:30.732 --> 40:33.387
but I have never seen you dance.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.432
- Just because
you've never seen it

40:34.475 --> 40:35.998
doesn't mean I can't do it.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.566
Back in my younger days,

40:38.610 --> 40:40.829
people used to compare
me to Justin Timberlake.

40:40.873 --> 40:41.961
- Which Justin Timberlake?

40:42.004 --> 40:42.918
Hold up, time out.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.180
Boy band Justin Timberlake

40:44.224 --> 40:46.226
or solo career
Justin Timberlake?

40:46.269 --> 40:47.662
♪ Bye, bye, bye

40:47.706 --> 40:49.185
Was my jam.

40:49.229 --> 40:53.494
I'm talking about MTV
award, solo Justin.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.540
Like jumping out of
that big boom box

40:55.583 --> 40:56.628
and coming out on stage,

40:56.671 --> 40:58.586
killing it with them
dope dance moves.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.675
- I saw him get down,
the man got moves.

41:00.719 --> 41:01.894
100, bro?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.286
- 100.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.375
I'm just saying, the
man can get down.

41:05.419 --> 41:06.725
- All right.

41:06.768 --> 41:07.813
I gotta see this.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.379
Let me see what you got.

41:09.423 --> 41:10.337
- Aight.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.120
-  Show us some moves.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.426
- I got moves.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.340
Check this two step.

41:14.341 --> 41:15.429
- Mr. Justin Timberlake.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.212
- Show 'em.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.039
- Watch.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.171
Tell 'em, tell 'em.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.825
- Go ahead, let's see.
- All right.

41:21.000 --> 41:21.827
- Sike!

41:23.959 --> 41:24.743
- Yo!

41:24.786 --> 41:26.135
Hold on, time out, look.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.572
He got ya'll too, I
knew you couldn't dance.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.490
Ya'll want some
of this pizza man?

41:32.533 --> 41:34.056
Ya'll want some of this?
- Yeah, let me get one.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.711
- All right, come
on, let's do it.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.462
- You ever see this
much money in one place?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.768
- Never.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.944
With my salary, I'd
probably make this

41:51.987 --> 41:53.554
in 10 years though.

41:53.598 --> 41:54.947
If I don't get shot first.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.601
- Whoa, you better
watch your mouth.

41:56.644 --> 41:59.647
Don't even put that type of
negative energy out there.

41:59.691 --> 42:02.389
Life and death and the power
of the tongue, my friend.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.173
- You're in the wrong field.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.784
You should've been a preacher.

42:05.827 --> 42:07.133
- Nope.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.134
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.399
- Hey, we got everything
bagged and tagged in there.

42:12.442 --> 42:14.009
You all covered out here?

42:14.053 --> 42:15.620
- We're almost done.

42:15.663 --> 42:17.535
- Dustin and Lamar should
be here any minute now

42:17.578 --> 42:20.363
to pick this all up and
bring it back to the station.

42:23.758 --> 42:24.890
- What's up, Tyler?

42:27.240 --> 42:28.502
You're thinking about
that big old mansion

42:28.546 --> 42:30.809
you can buy with all
this dirty money, huh?

42:30.852 --> 42:33.376
- Nah, not at all.

42:33.420 --> 42:34.595
I'm just glad we're getting
this off the street.

42:34.639 --> 42:37.119
I'm sure we ruined
some drug dealer's day.

42:37.163 --> 42:38.077
- I wish.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.513
The way they dashed out of here,

42:39.557 --> 42:41.167
this money wasn't
that important.

42:41.210 --> 42:44.518
Probably only took them a
few days to accumulate it.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.606
Domestic disturbance,

42:45.650 --> 42:47.347
648 Westbrook Street.

42:47.390 --> 42:48.653
- Copy.

42:48.696 --> 42:50.002
648 Westbrook Street.

42:50.045 --> 42:51.351
- We're gonna take this.

42:51.394 --> 42:52.657
- You guys be careful,
we're right behind ya.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.543
- See you inside.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.458
Yeah, I should be
home around five.

43:11.501 --> 43:12.502
Yeah, give me a call then there.

43:12.546 --> 43:13.547
Okay?

43:13.591 --> 43:14.243
Thanks, bye.

43:17.377 --> 43:18.465
Drew.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.207
Drew!

43:24.471 --> 43:25.428
Are you okay?

43:26.778 --> 43:27.561
- Yes, sir.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.651
I'm doing good, I was
just happy to be here.

43:33.567 --> 43:34.437
- Have you told anyone?

43:35.961 --> 43:36.788
- Told anyone what?

43:39.138 --> 43:41.488
- Son, you're not fooling me.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.492
I've seen that look
on your face before.

43:47.581 --> 43:48.756
You're having flashbacks.

43:50.279 --> 43:51.193
PTSD?

43:52.847 --> 43:54.544
Now have you told anyone?

43:56.329 --> 43:59.245
- It's nothing, and I
don't want to burden anyone

43:59.288 --> 44:00.942
with some bad memories.

44:02.030 --> 44:03.379
It'll go away.

44:03.423 --> 44:05.599
- No, no, Drew, that is
not the way it works.

44:07.035 --> 44:12.127
Listen, I've been retired,
in fact, over two decades,

44:12.171 --> 44:14.173
and I still have flashbacks.

44:15.696 --> 44:18.830
Yeah, I'm sitting
in my living room,

44:18.873 --> 44:20.266
beautiful day, and
all of a sudden

44:20.309 --> 44:21.528
some neighborhood kid lights off

44:21.571 --> 44:24.662
a pack of firecrackers and boom!

44:24.705 --> 44:27.708
I'm right back in the
heat of the war zone

44:27.752 --> 44:29.449
fighting for my life.

44:29.492 --> 44:30.363
Yelling, screaming.

44:32.104 --> 44:35.063
But in reality, I'm still
sitting in that chair

44:35.107 --> 44:35.803
in my living room.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.067
Man, it's so real.

44:40.765 --> 44:42.549
I can even smell the gunpowder.

44:45.639 --> 44:46.858
Now, now, you gotta
get some help.

44:46.901 --> 44:48.163
You gotta talk to someone.

44:49.599 --> 44:52.515
- I don't even know where
to begin to look for help.

44:52.559 --> 44:55.649
- I get it, 100%.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.869
When I first came
back, I was right

44:57.912 --> 44:59.131
where you are right now.

45:00.219 --> 45:01.699
I had the weight of the war

45:01.742 --> 45:02.830
sitting on my shoulders.

45:05.528 --> 45:07.705
Nobody had any answers, nobody.

45:10.577 --> 45:11.534
I was so lost.

45:14.189 --> 45:15.060
Lost my wife.

45:18.411 --> 45:19.717
Almost lost my children.

45:25.244 --> 45:27.550
It's more than one
person can bear.

45:29.465 --> 45:30.597
- What am I supposed to do?

45:31.598 --> 45:32.642
- I got your six.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.733
I'll walk you through it, okay?

45:38.997 --> 45:39.737
- Yes, sir.

45:57.929 --> 45:58.756
- Are you all right?

45:58.799 --> 46:00.496
- My dad hit my mom!

46:00.540 --> 46:01.454
- Secure the kid.

46:01.497 --> 46:02.585
Don't move until backup arrives.

46:07.547 --> 46:08.940
- Shots fired, shots fired!

46:08.983 --> 46:12.160
648 Westbrook Avenue, we
need backup immediately!

46:30.700 --> 46:32.572
- It's okay, it's all right.

46:33.878 --> 46:35.923
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

46:35.967 --> 46:36.881
Who's here with you?

46:36.924 --> 46:38.186
-  Mommy and daddy.

46:38.230 --> 46:40.885
- Can you show me
where they are?

46:40.928 --> 46:42.190
Okay.

46:43.888 --> 46:45.193
- What do we have?

46:45.237 --> 46:46.804
- Two shots were fired before
Officer Eugene went in.

46:46.847 --> 46:47.761
- He went in alone?

46:47.805 --> 46:48.893
- Yeah, he went in solo.

46:48.936 --> 46:50.372
- Officer Brenda,
secure the back exit.

46:50.416 --> 46:51.243
And Tyler, stay with the kid,

46:51.286 --> 46:52.897
call EMT and backup.

48:47.925 --> 48:52.190
- Now, as far as private
investigator shows go,

48:52.233 --> 48:55.628
Magnum, P.I. was
by far the best.

48:55.671 --> 48:56.977
Ah, ah, ah!

48:57.021 --> 49:01.112
It had your action and
suspense, it had laughs,

49:01.155 --> 49:04.332
and the best part,
was that fantastic

49:04.376 --> 49:06.378
mustache he sported.

49:06.421 --> 49:10.643
- Now if you ask me, the
mustache was a little overrated.

49:10.686 --> 49:13.037
Yeah, kinda looked like
he had a caterpillar

49:13.080 --> 49:14.255
attached to his face.

49:15.691 --> 49:17.519
In actuality, Starsky & Hutch

49:17.563 --> 49:20.479
was a much better
show than Magnum, P.I.

49:20.522 --> 49:22.394
No, come on, no
really, seriously.

49:22.437 --> 49:25.875
Name me a duo that was better
than Starsky & Hutch, go head.

49:27.834 --> 49:28.922
Can't do it, huh?

49:30.315 --> 49:31.969
- Tubbs and
Crockett, Miami Vice.

49:32.012 --> 49:32.970
- Miami Vice?

49:33.013 --> 49:34.101
- Absolutely!

49:34.145 --> 49:35.146
- Oh, get out!

49:35.189 --> 49:37.365
- Miami Vice was
an iconic series.

49:37.409 --> 49:40.934
People tend to focus on the
flashy suits and flashy cars,

49:40.978 --> 49:44.111
but under that was a
serious crime drama.

49:44.155 --> 49:46.331
And a lot of what was
going on in the show

49:46.374 --> 49:49.464
was just a reflection of what
was happening in the city.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.118
- I couldn't see anything

49:51.162 --> 49:52.902
with the reflection off
those bright colored suits

49:52.946 --> 49:54.904
they wore with pastel shirts.

49:54.948 --> 49:56.558
Now come on, you tell me,

49:56.602 --> 50:01.085
what self respecting detective
is gonna wear pastel shirts?

50:01.128 --> 50:03.304
- Hey, ask the kid,
see what he thinks.

50:03.348 --> 50:05.132
- What would he know
about them old shows?

50:05.176 --> 50:07.134
- These kids love
80s pop culture.

50:07.178 --> 50:10.224
Son, tell him.

50:10.268 --> 50:14.446
Magnum, P.I., Starsky
& Hutch, Miami Vice.

50:14.489 --> 50:15.969
Which was the best?

50:16.013 --> 50:17.188
- What did I just walk into?

50:17.231 --> 50:18.885
- Boy, just answer the question.

50:20.539 --> 50:24.108
- Okay, Knight Rider,
that was my favorite.

50:25.065 --> 50:27.285
- The one with the talking car?

50:27.328 --> 50:30.984
- These kids don't know
anything about anything.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.768
Go stand over there
in the corner.

50:33.639 --> 50:35.162
Grown folks are talking.

50:35.206 --> 50:36.990
So where you boys headed today?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.078
- We headed to the
community center

50:38.122 --> 50:39.166
for a few hours, Pops.

50:39.210 --> 50:40.298
- Good.

50:40.341 --> 50:42.909
Kids will be happy
to see you back home.

50:42.952 --> 50:43.997
- Yeah, it's been a while.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.390
I'm looking forward
to seeing them.

50:47.783 --> 50:52.440
- So, you guys gonna tell me
what happened the other day?

50:52.484 --> 50:54.616
Your little run in
with the police?

50:54.660 --> 50:55.922
- It was nothing, Pops.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.445
Some things were said,
things got heated,

50:57.489 --> 50:59.099
you know, she let us
go with a warning.

51:01.362 --> 51:04.104
- You do realize
withholding the truth

51:04.148 --> 51:06.454
isn't much different
from lying, right?

51:06.498 --> 51:09.370
Okay, so, let's try this again.

51:10.371 --> 51:11.938
What happened the other day?

51:13.635 --> 51:15.028
- All right.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.812
I may have missed a
stop sign, you know,

51:16.856 --> 51:17.770
I don't think I did,

51:17.813 --> 51:19.685
but the officer pulled us over.

51:19.728 --> 51:20.947
She looks in the car at Tracy

51:20.990 --> 51:23.123
and just assumes
we're up to no good.

51:23.167 --> 51:25.734
She takes my license, she
goes back to her patrol car,

51:25.778 --> 51:27.127
and when she comes back,

51:27.171 --> 51:28.215
she tells me she wants
us to get out the car

51:28.259 --> 51:29.956
so she can search it.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.305
- Makes no sense, but go on.

51:31.349 --> 51:32.437
-  Yeah, it
didn't feel right,

51:32.480 --> 51:34.047
and I told the officer that.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.266
I told her that I felt
like I was being profiled

51:35.309 --> 51:36.745
and that she didn't
have a warrant,

51:36.789 --> 51:38.312
she couldn't search my car.

51:38.356 --> 51:40.053
- That probably didn't
go over very well.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.315
- It didn't.

51:41.359 --> 51:43.012
She said that if she wanted to,

51:43.056 --> 51:45.624
she could bust out my
windows, pull me out the car,

51:45.667 --> 51:47.234
and search it anyway.

51:47.278 --> 51:50.107
- Son, listen to me.

51:50.150 --> 51:53.762
I'm always gonna be on
your side no matter what,

51:53.806 --> 51:55.112
but you can't argue
with the person

51:55.155 --> 51:57.114
who has a badge and a gun.

51:57.157 --> 51:58.941
You're not gonna
win that argument.

52:00.204 --> 52:03.163
And for heaven's
sakes, keep your cool.

52:03.207 --> 52:05.165
You can't be out here
getting in a shouting match

52:05.209 --> 52:06.079
with law enforcement.

52:07.733 --> 52:11.128
Focus on not getting locked
up and getting home safe.

52:11.171 --> 52:11.998
- Yeah, but Pops
come on, she was--

52:12.041 --> 52:12.999
- "But Pops" nothing.

52:14.696 --> 52:18.178
Not getting locked up and
getting home safe, that's it.

52:24.271 --> 52:25.968
Theo told me your
meeting went well.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.145
Good.

52:29.363 --> 52:30.451
I'm proud of you two.

52:32.192 --> 52:32.975
Come here.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.545
You know, your get
your hardheadedness

52:37.589 --> 52:39.243
from your mother,
you know that, right?

52:39.286 --> 52:40.113
- Yeah, I know.

52:41.897 --> 52:42.768
- Are we done huggin'?

52:42.811 --> 52:44.161
We're gonna be late.

52:44.204 --> 52:45.423
- Yeah, we gotta head out.

52:46.685 --> 52:48.252
- All right, you
guys have a good day.

52:48.295 --> 52:50.210
- See you, Mr. Mitchell.

52:50.254 --> 52:51.211
See you, Mr. Hector.

52:51.255 --> 52:51.994
All right, Pops.

52:52.038 --> 52:52.691
- Be safe!

53:03.180 --> 53:04.006
- Oh, Drew!

53:05.094 --> 53:07.836
Oh my gosh, welcome back!

53:07.880 --> 53:09.751
- Thanks, it's good to be back.

53:09.795 --> 53:11.144
- So, when'd you get back?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.058
- I just got back
a few days ago.

53:12.101 --> 53:13.015
I've been taking some time out

53:13.059 --> 53:14.103
to hang out with the family.

53:14.147 --> 53:15.627
- Oh yeah, I definitely
feel you on that.

53:15.670 --> 53:17.977
I bet your dad's ecstatic
to have you back.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.326
- He is.

53:19.370 --> 53:20.197
They threw a party for
me, it was pretty cool.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.155
- Uh, where was my invite?

53:22.199 --> 53:25.027
- Hey, Dad did the
invites, it's not my fault.

53:25.071 --> 53:26.420
- Mhm, anyway.

53:26.464 --> 53:29.380
So, are you back for good
or is this like a visit?

53:29.423 --> 53:31.425
- No, I'm back. I just came
by today to say hi to everyone

53:31.469 --> 53:33.471
and give Theo a hand
with his classes.

53:33.514 --> 53:35.777
I'm gonna take a few more days
off before I jump back in.

53:35.821 --> 53:37.779
- Awesome. Okay, you
know you have to stop by

53:37.823 --> 53:39.128
and see Kimberly, okay?

53:39.172 --> 53:41.305
She's been asking for
you almost every day.

53:41.348 --> 53:43.132
-  Absolutely,
I've got a gift for her.

53:43.176 --> 53:44.699
- She's gonna be so excited.

53:44.743 --> 53:46.310
But anyway, holla at me
when you're done, okay?

53:46.353 --> 53:47.311
-  I will.

53:47.354 --> 53:48.312
- Aight.

53:48.355 --> 53:49.313
-  All right,
see you later.

53:49.356 --> 53:50.357
- Yes, see you later!

53:50.401 --> 53:51.271
- All right, Alex,
catch you later!

53:51.315 --> 53:52.185
-  See ya!

54:13.293 --> 54:14.816
- Drew!

54:14.860 --> 54:16.035
What's up, bro?

54:18.037 --> 54:19.908
-  Mr. Drew!

54:21.301 --> 54:23.216
- Are you gonna be
working here again?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.174
- Yes, I'm gonna be
coming back in a few days.

54:25.218 --> 54:26.088
- A few days?

54:26.132 --> 54:27.742
- Just a few days, I'll be back.

54:27.786 --> 54:30.397
- Let the man breathe,
he just got back.

54:30.441 --> 54:32.356
- Yes, stop crowding the man.

54:32.399 --> 54:34.401
You guys go back to your seats.

54:34.445 --> 54:37.056
These kids have been
asking and asking for you.

54:37.099 --> 54:39.014
- I've been asking
about them too.

54:39.058 --> 54:40.102
How's your class going?

54:40.146 --> 54:42.017
- Art supplies are still low,

54:42.061 --> 54:44.019
but apart from
that, all is well.

54:44.063 --> 54:45.325
It's good to see you, Drew.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.805
- Thank you.

54:46.848 --> 54:47.545
I'm gonna go holla at
Christopher's class real quick.

54:47.588 --> 54:49.111
- Okay, see you later.

54:49.155 --> 54:51.113
- See you later, Candice.

54:52.637 --> 54:53.638
- I know, right.

54:53.681 --> 54:54.508
- Hey!

54:54.552 --> 54:55.204
- Hey!

54:57.250 --> 54:59.731
- Give me my hug,
give me my hug.

54:59.774 --> 55:01.036
- What are you doing here?

55:01.080 --> 55:01.863
I thought you were gonna
wait a few more days

55:01.907 --> 55:03.082
before you came back in.

55:03.125 --> 55:04.562
- Well actually,
that's kinda my fault.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.259
I begged him to
come in and help out

55:06.303 --> 55:07.304
with my class today.

55:07.347 --> 55:08.957
- Oh, what are you
teaching today?

55:09.001 --> 55:10.916
- I'm gonna be doing some Ray
Charles and Rock Mendenhall.

55:10.959 --> 55:12.657
A little blues and classical
mixed in one class.

55:12.700 --> 55:15.224
- Okay, sounds like it's
gonna be an interesting day.

55:15.268 --> 55:16.704
-  You know it.

55:16.748 --> 55:18.097
- That's why he dragged me in.
- Ah, whatever, man!

55:18.140 --> 55:19.925
- Make sure you stop by
and say hi to Kimberly

55:19.968 --> 55:21.187
before you leave, okay?

55:21.230 --> 55:21.883
-  Okay, I'll
do it right now.

55:21.927 --> 55:23.232
- What's up, Chris?

55:23.276 --> 55:24.669
- I thought I heard
ya'll in the building.

55:24.712 --> 55:25.713
Aw, man!

55:25.757 --> 55:27.324
- Don't leave your man hanging.

55:27.367 --> 55:28.368
Good to see you, bro.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.717
- What's going on?

55:29.761 --> 55:31.023
- Just stopping by to
say hello to everyone

55:31.066 --> 55:32.633
and give Theo a
hand with his class.

55:32.677 --> 55:33.547
Have you heard
anything from Eric

55:33.591 --> 55:34.896
about the grant yet?

55:34.940 --> 55:36.811
- No, nothing yet.

55:36.855 --> 55:38.335
I hope we hear
something quick though.

55:38.378 --> 55:39.597
- Yeah.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.902
We had to cancel
the percussion class

55:40.946 --> 55:42.861
because the drums were
so old and beat up,

55:42.904 --> 55:44.471
they didn't even
sound right anymore.

55:44.515 --> 55:45.254
- Listen, guys.

55:45.298 --> 55:46.430
It's gonna happen.

55:46.473 --> 55:47.605
The grant is gonna come through,

55:47.648 --> 55:49.171
and everything is
gonna work itself out,

55:49.215 --> 55:51.913
I just hope it's sooner
rather than later.

55:51.957 --> 55:53.306
- Yeah.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.263
- Mr. Drew!

55:55.613 --> 55:57.789
- It's so good to see you.
- Are you back for good?

55:57.832 --> 55:59.399
- Yes, I'm back for good.

55:59.443 --> 56:00.487
I got a gift for you.

56:00.531 --> 56:01.836
- Really?

56:01.880 --> 56:02.968
- This is for you.

56:03.011 --> 56:04.273
- What is it?

56:04.317 --> 56:05.449
- It's a surprise.

56:05.492 --> 56:06.537
And open it when you get home.

56:06.580 --> 56:08.321
- Thank you, Mr. Drew.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.062
Can I ask you
something, Mr. Drew?

56:11.368 --> 56:13.457
- You can ask me anything.

56:13.500 --> 56:15.197
- Some of the kids
have been saying

56:15.241 --> 56:16.416
that we won't be
able to come back

56:16.460 --> 56:18.462
to the after school
program anymore,

56:18.505 --> 56:20.464
that it's going to
be closing soon.

56:20.507 --> 56:21.160
Is that true?

56:24.424 --> 56:27.035
- We're not gonna
let that happen.

56:27.079 --> 56:28.385
We're not gonna close it,

56:28.428 --> 56:30.343
we're gonna find a way
to keep those doors open.

56:30.387 --> 56:31.213
- You promise?

56:33.694 --> 56:34.391
- Pinky promise.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.568
- Hello, Auto Brothers Repair.

56:37.611 --> 56:39.874
This is Daniel Thomas,
how may I be of service?

56:43.182 --> 56:46.228
Aside from being talented kids,

56:46.272 --> 56:48.492
they are a great asset
to this community.

56:50.929 --> 56:55.150
Ooh, they've been working at
the community center for years.

56:55.194 --> 56:58.240
Investing their time
and money into it.

56:58.284 --> 56:59.590
Absolutely.

56:59.633 --> 57:01.548
If you need more
information from me,

57:01.592 --> 57:03.245
please feel free to call.

57:05.596 --> 57:06.553
- Who was that?

57:06.597 --> 57:07.249
Everything okay?

57:08.512 --> 57:10.427
- People about the grant.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.298
Doing their due
diligence on the boys,

57:12.341 --> 57:14.692
I guess they put me down as
a reference or something.

57:16.389 --> 57:18.391
Tell you what,
those boys are gonna

57:18.435 --> 57:20.567
make something of themselves.

57:20.611 --> 57:21.525
- Are you surprised?

57:21.568 --> 57:23.440
You raised those boys well.

57:23.483 --> 57:27.182
- Not surprised, I'm
just happy to see that

57:27.226 --> 57:28.575
they found their purpose.

57:29.924 --> 57:31.796
You know, I wish their
mom was still with us.

57:33.493 --> 57:37.497
All that musical ability,
they get it from her.

57:39.412 --> 57:40.892
She'd be so proud of them.

57:40.935 --> 57:42.110
-  Yeah.

57:43.590 --> 57:46.898
- Breathing is very important
for good vocal expression.

57:46.941 --> 57:48.943
Controlling how you
release your breath

57:48.987 --> 57:51.729
can enhance the
delivery of each note.

57:51.772 --> 57:53.600
And, as you may have guessed,

57:53.644 --> 57:56.603
we will be focusing on
breathing next week.

57:56.647 --> 57:58.692
So here's an exercise I
want you guys to practice

57:58.736 --> 58:00.302
when you go home.

58:00.346 --> 58:04.742
You want to stand up so your
tummy is fully extended,

58:06.439 --> 58:08.572
and then you want to take
a deep breath and hold it

58:08.615 --> 58:10.791
before you release
your notes, like this.

58:12.271 --> 58:15.404
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la

58:19.626 --> 58:21.585
All right, that's all the
time we have for today,

58:21.628 --> 58:22.890
I'll see you guys next week.

58:22.934 --> 58:24.849
Practice your vocal exercises,

58:24.892 --> 58:27.460
and try not to stress
your vocal chords.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.505
Okay?

58:28.548 --> 58:29.506
- Okay.

58:29.549 --> 58:30.942
- All right, bye
guys, thank you.

58:36.425 --> 58:38.253
- Hey.

58:38.297 --> 58:39.167
We're gonna go grab some grub,

58:39.211 --> 58:40.081
you want to roll with us?

58:40.125 --> 58:41.430
- Sure, give me five minutes.

58:41.474 --> 58:42.214
- All right, cool,
meet us out front.

58:42.257 --> 58:42.910
-  Okay.

58:45.478 --> 58:47.001
- It was so easy.

58:47.045 --> 58:49.134
I just sort of fell into it.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.180
I would tell the doctor
that I had back pains,

58:52.224 --> 58:54.269
and he would write
me a prescription,

58:54.313 --> 58:55.444
no questions asked.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.926
This went on for
about three years,

58:58.970 --> 59:02.495
and I wasn't buying
drugs in some back alley.

59:02.539 --> 59:03.627
He didn't look
like what I thought

59:03.670 --> 59:05.542
a drug dealer looked like.

59:05.585 --> 59:08.545
He wore a lab coat and a tie,

59:08.588 --> 59:10.155
but he was my drug dealer,

59:10.198 --> 59:11.809
and I was his faithful customer.

59:13.462 --> 59:17.466
A functioning addict with
a husband and two children.

59:17.510 --> 59:20.208
I look back on that time
and it terrifies me.

59:21.514 --> 59:22.646
If it weren't for
the grace of God,

59:22.689 --> 59:25.736
I don't know where my
life would be right now.

59:25.779 --> 59:29.130
I'm thankful, thankful
that I'm here now

59:29.174 --> 59:30.392
and not there anymore.

59:35.963 --> 59:37.661
- Thank you for sharing
with us, Marilyn.

59:37.704 --> 59:41.099
And we're thankful to have
you here with us as well.

59:41.142 --> 59:41.795
Who's next?

59:42.970 --> 59:43.928
What about you, Christopher?

59:43.971 --> 59:45.582
Would you like to share with us?

59:47.409 --> 59:48.149
- Sure.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.892
Yeah, things are
going really good.

59:51.936 --> 59:54.808
I'm going on seven
years clean now,

59:54.852 --> 59:56.593
no pills or alcohol.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:00.335
Seven years.

1:00:02.076 --> 1:00:03.034
When I started this journey,

1:00:03.077 --> 1:00:05.427
I didn't think it was possible.

1:00:05.471 --> 1:00:07.473
I couldn't see anything
past the addiction.

1:00:09.518 --> 1:00:11.477
I'd been a slave to
pills for so long

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.566
that I'd forgotten what
it was like to be free.

1:00:16.569 --> 1:00:18.353
You all have
inspired me so much.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.401
And ya'll believed in me
when I didn't believe in me.

1:00:24.403 --> 1:00:27.536
Marilyn, I vividly remember
you calling to check on me,

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:29.016
May 10th, 2012.

1:00:31.018 --> 1:00:32.585
I almost relapsed that day.

1:00:34.892 --> 1:00:36.589
And you called to say hello,

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:38.591
stayed on the phone
with me for hours.

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:42.551
That phone call
probably saved my life.

1:00:44.379 --> 1:00:46.077
- That's why having a
support system like this

1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:46.773
is so important.

1:00:48.601 --> 1:00:51.038
But you have to recognize
that you need help.

1:00:51.082 --> 1:00:52.649
And with that, comes change.

1:00:54.172 --> 1:00:55.739
What are some of the
changes that you had to make

1:00:55.782 --> 1:00:57.915
in order to be where
you are right now today?

1:00:59.351 --> 1:01:01.222
- Aside from connecting
with this group,

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.748
I would say a change
in my environment

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:05.705
and keeping my hands busy.

1:01:07.794 --> 1:01:08.969
I had to get out of
my old neighborhood

1:01:09.013 --> 1:01:10.362
and my old way of thinking.

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:13.757
I lost a few friends
along the way,

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:16.498
but I gained some new ones.

1:01:16.542 --> 1:01:17.674
- Tell us about your new friends

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:19.763
and your new environment.

1:01:19.806 --> 1:01:21.547
- My new friends?

1:01:21.590 --> 1:01:23.462
Fellow musicians that
help me stay focused

1:01:23.505 --> 1:01:24.768
on what's really important,

1:01:26.465 --> 1:01:27.640
and my new environment is
this after school program

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:29.729
for inner city kids.

1:01:29.773 --> 1:01:31.688
I teach bass and drums.

1:01:31.731 --> 1:01:34.603
I've been doing that for
about five, six years.

1:01:34.647 --> 1:01:35.517
It's given me a purpose.

1:01:37.128 --> 1:01:40.087
I'm involved in something
that is way bigger than me.

1:01:40.131 --> 1:01:41.393
Something that
touches other's lives

1:01:41.436 --> 1:01:42.176
in a positive way.

1:01:43.787 --> 1:01:44.918
And I didn't have that before.

1:01:46.354 --> 1:01:47.268
It's valuable.

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:50.794
It really helps me keep
things in perspective.

1:01:56.190 --> 1:01:57.278
Hey!

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:58.627
What are ya'll doing here?

1:01:58.671 --> 1:02:00.151
- We're here to take
you to lunch, come on.

1:02:00.194 --> 1:02:01.718
You're paying, though!

1:02:01.761 --> 1:02:03.807
-  We'll bring
you back to your car.

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:05.156
-  That's perfect.

1:02:05.199 --> 1:02:07.462
-  The door's open, bro!

1:02:07.506 --> 1:02:08.986
-  Cool.

1:02:09.029 --> 1:02:10.465
-  So how's it going,
man? How did everything go?

1:02:10.509 --> 1:02:12.119
-  What's up, what's up?

1:02:12.163 --> 1:02:13.077
- It's good.

1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:13.817
It went really good today.

1:02:15.383 --> 1:02:17.037
We were just sharing the
highs and lows of the journey.

1:02:17.081 --> 1:02:18.691
-  That's
good, that's good.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:20.475
- Talked a little bit about
the after school program.

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:21.694
-  Oh yeah?

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:22.956
- Talked a little bit
about ya'll as well.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:23.870
-  You talked about us?

1:02:23.914 --> 1:02:24.784
-  You talked about us?

1:02:24.828 --> 1:02:26.003
- What'd you tell about us, man?

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:27.787
- Just told them a
little bit about Mindya.

1:02:29.876 --> 1:02:30.747
- Really?

1:02:30.790 --> 1:02:31.443
Mind ya business?

1:02:32.705 --> 1:02:34.315
Very funny.

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:35.708
The guy came out of
there with jokes.

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:37.144
- Yo, yo.
- Every time.

1:02:37.188 --> 1:02:38.755
- He got you, Trace.

1:02:38.798 --> 1:02:39.886
He got you good, Trace.

1:02:39.930 --> 1:02:41.192
- Where are we going?

1:02:41.235 --> 1:02:42.497
Because I am so
hungry right now.

1:02:42.541 --> 1:02:43.281
- I don't know, what
ya'll want to do,

1:02:43.324 --> 1:02:44.586
what ya'll want to do?

1:02:44.630 --> 1:02:45.979
- New vegan place in
Ybor, let's try that.

1:02:46.023 --> 1:02:47.285
- Come on, Tracy.

1:02:47.328 --> 1:02:49.766
You mean vegan as in
like, no meat, Trace?

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:51.115
Really?

1:02:51.158 --> 1:02:52.420
- Yeah, vegan, as in
you guys always pick

1:02:52.464 --> 1:02:53.770
where we eat, so now
it's my turn to pick.

1:02:53.813 --> 1:02:55.075
-  Come on, Trace!

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:56.816
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, I
don't want to hear it.

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.470
- Look how big he is.

1:02:58.513 --> 1:03:00.864
- Prepare yourselves for
veggie burgers and pizza,

1:03:00.907 --> 1:03:02.822
and you're gonna like it too.

1:03:02.866 --> 1:03:03.997
- Boo!

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:05.869
- A burger can't be a
burger without meat.

1:03:07.218 --> 1:03:08.567
- Let's start the car,
come on, I'm hungry.

1:03:08.610 --> 1:03:09.916
- All right, fine.

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:11.004
All right, listen, I'm
just letting ya'll know,

1:03:11.048 --> 1:03:12.484
Drew ain't got no seat belts,

1:03:12.527 --> 1:03:13.877
so you better hold on tight.

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:14.660
- Better hold on tight.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:03:14.703 --> 1:03:15.400
Ya'll ready?

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:16.836
Hold on.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.925
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,

1:03:18.969 --> 1:03:20.274
wait, wait, let it--

1:03:20.318 --> 1:03:21.319
- Yo!
- That just happened?

1:03:21.362 --> 1:03:22.711
- Hold on.

1:03:22.755 --> 1:03:24.017
You wanna talk to her,
you wanna talk to her?

1:03:24.061 --> 1:03:24.801
- Listen here, baby.

1:03:24.844 --> 1:03:26.193
I want you to start.

1:03:27.629 --> 1:03:29.457
Prove me right, prove me right.

1:03:29.501 --> 1:03:30.415
I believe in you.

1:03:30.458 --> 1:03:31.764
Go ahead, go ahead.

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:32.809
-  All right,
hold on, hold on.

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:34.419
- My baby, it's my
baby, watch this.

1:03:34.462 --> 1:03:35.812
- Oh!

1:03:37.117 --> 1:03:38.379
- Now talk about my
car, yeah, keep talking.

1:03:38.423 --> 1:03:39.424
- Yo, we out.

1:03:39.467 --> 1:03:40.817
Ayo, hold on ya'll.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:42.949
Lord help us please,
Lord help us please.

1:03:42.993 --> 1:03:43.732
Hold on, hold on.

1:03:43.776 --> 1:03:45.038
Let's do it.

1:03:45.082 --> 1:03:45.734
Woo!

1:03:54.613 --> 1:03:56.136
- Doesn't that look
like the vehicle

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:57.572
that was reported stolen
from Highland Park

1:03:57.616 --> 1:03:58.269
a few weeks ago?

1:04:01.141 --> 1:04:02.795
- How do you
remember this stuff?

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:04.318
- Being young has its benefits.

1:04:05.711 --> 1:04:06.799
- Wiseguy.

1:04:20.073 --> 1:04:21.814
- There's no tag on the car but,

1:04:21.858 --> 1:04:22.902
I'm sure this is the one.

1:04:22.946 --> 1:04:24.251
How do you want to do this?

1:04:26.253 --> 1:04:27.820
- All right.

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.561
I'm gonna let you take
the lead on this one.

1:04:29.604 --> 1:04:30.997
Try not to alarm anyone.

1:04:31.041 --> 1:04:32.912
We just want to make
sure this is or isn't

1:04:32.956 --> 1:04:34.827
the vehicle that's
reported stolen.

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:36.698
Let's secure the driver first,

1:04:36.742 --> 1:04:38.700
then get everyone else
out of the vehicle.

1:04:38.744 --> 1:04:40.964
Keep your eyes wide
open, and stay calm.

1:04:41.007 --> 1:04:41.878
Let's go.

1:04:53.933 --> 1:04:55.326
- Good evening, sir.

1:04:55.369 --> 1:04:57.154
Would you mind stepping
outside of the car?

1:04:58.764 --> 1:05:00.113
- Stepping outside of the
car for what, Officer?

1:05:00.157 --> 1:05:01.419
-  We just need
to speak with you.

1:05:01.462 --> 1:05:02.637
- Officer, we didn't
do anything wrong.

1:05:02.681 --> 1:05:03.856
We just finished
teaching a group of kids

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:05.379
from our after school program.

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.468
We're just trying to
get something to eat.

1:05:07.512 --> 1:05:09.775
- Just sit tight
for a second, ma'am.

1:05:09.818 --> 1:05:10.994
-  Just step
out of the car,

1:05:11.037 --> 1:05:12.952
and I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:14.780
- Man, just do
what he says, man.

1:05:14.823 --> 1:05:16.216
Let's get this over with.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:16.913
- All right.

1:05:19.437 --> 1:05:21.874
- Can you all step out of
the car for me as well?

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.920
I need you to sit up
over here on the curb.

1:05:27.967 --> 1:05:29.403
- Turn around for me sir,

1:05:29.447 --> 1:05:30.709
and put your hands
behind your back.

1:05:30.752 --> 1:05:32.363
- Why do I have to put
my hands behind my back?

1:05:32.406 --> 1:05:34.626
Can you tell me what's going on?

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:35.844
I didn't do anything.

1:05:35.888 --> 1:05:36.976
- This is just a
safety precaution.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:38.064
If you did nothing,
then you have nothing

1:05:38.108 --> 1:05:39.457
to worry about, right?

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:40.893
- Officer, can you please
tell us what's going on?

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:43.156
We have rights, we know you
can't stop us for no reason.

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:46.072
- Sir, just sit there and
be quiet for right now.

1:05:46.116 --> 1:05:47.378
- The quicker you turn around,

1:05:47.421 --> 1:05:49.467
the quicker we can get
you all out of here.

1:05:50.816 --> 1:05:51.599
- All right, man.

1:05:59.607 --> 1:06:01.000
-  Your car has no tags,

1:06:01.044 --> 1:06:03.263
and it fits the description
of a car that was stolen

1:06:03.307 --> 1:06:04.482
two weeks ago.

1:06:04.525 --> 1:06:05.744
- Whoa, whoa,
excuse me, Officer.

1:06:05.787 --> 1:06:07.180
My brother just
purchased this car,

1:06:07.224 --> 1:06:08.442
it's not stolen, man!

1:06:08.486 --> 1:06:09.139
Get off!

1:06:10.488 --> 1:06:11.837
-  Please,
you need to relax!

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.360
- Whoa, listen, listen
to me, listen to me!

1:06:13.404 --> 1:06:14.535
-  Officer Tyler,

1:06:14.579 --> 1:06:15.580
do you have the
situation under control?

1:06:15.623 --> 1:06:16.885
- Listen to me, my brother,

1:06:16.929 --> 1:06:17.712
he didn't steal this
car, it's not stolen!

1:06:17.756 --> 1:06:18.539
Get off of me!

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:20.846
- What is he doing, man?

1:06:20.889 --> 1:06:21.716
-  My brother
just purchased this car!

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:23.196
- Man, we're not criminals,

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.719
how's it cool to throw him
on the pavement like that?

1:06:24.763 --> 1:06:27.070
- I didn't ask for your opinion,
I asked you to sit there.

1:06:27.113 --> 1:06:28.027
You can sit there and be calm,

1:06:28.071 --> 1:06:29.681
or you could be arrested.

1:06:31.465 --> 1:06:32.858
- You're hurting me!

1:06:32.901 --> 1:06:34.207
-  You need
to remain calm.

1:06:34.251 --> 1:06:36.514
- Sir, get back on the curb!

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:12.941
- Hello?

1:07:12.985 --> 1:07:13.986
Thomas residence.

1:07:17.076 --> 1:07:19.165
Yes, this is his father.

1:07:29.871 --> 1:07:32.178
The boys are gonna be
thrilled to hear this.

1:07:32.222 --> 1:07:34.137
- Yeah, I wish I had more time

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:35.442
to give back to my community,

1:07:35.486 --> 1:07:36.878
but what I lack in time,

1:07:36.922 --> 1:07:39.403
I hope I can make
up for in donations.

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:41.100
We're prepared to
offer a full renovation

1:07:41.144 --> 1:07:42.754
of the current facility,

1:07:42.797 --> 1:07:45.148
or the purchase of a new
facility, whichever works.

1:07:45.191 --> 1:07:48.151
Along with new
instruments, and of course,

1:07:48.194 --> 1:07:49.500
future financial support.

1:07:49.543 --> 1:07:51.154
But we need them in as
soon as they're available

1:07:51.197 --> 1:07:52.590
to finalize everything.

1:07:52.633 --> 1:07:54.853
- This is exciting news.

1:07:54.896 --> 1:07:56.985
The boys should be
home any minute now,

1:07:57.029 --> 1:07:58.726
and I'll have them
give you a call

1:07:58.770 --> 1:08:00.206
as soon as they get in.

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:01.555
- Alrighty, sir. It was a
pleasure speaking with you.

1:08:01.599 --> 1:08:02.730
- And you as well.

1:08:06.038 --> 1:08:07.083
Yes!

1:08:50.082 --> 1:08:52.302
Drew, this is your dad.

1:08:53.825 --> 1:08:55.392
I've been trying
to reach you guys.

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:59.570
Eric called, and he
wants to make a donation

1:08:59.613 --> 1:09:01.049
to the after school program.

1:09:02.660 --> 1:09:04.052
Call me right back.

1:09:57.367 --> 1:09:58.672
Tell me what happened?

1:09:58.716 --> 1:10:00.239
- Pops, we got
pulled over again.

1:10:00.283 --> 1:10:02.285
For some reason, they
thought our car was stolen.

1:10:02.328 --> 1:10:03.938
- Drew just bought that car!

1:10:03.982 --> 1:10:05.897
- I know, I know, Pops. But
they said it fit the description

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:07.551
of another vehicle that
was stolen in the area

1:10:07.594 --> 1:10:09.161
that we was in.

1:10:09.205 --> 1:10:11.990
They asked us to get
out of the car, Pops,

1:10:12.033 --> 1:10:14.340
then another officer,
he started to cuff me,

1:10:14.384 --> 1:10:16.821
and that's when it all went bad.

1:10:16.864 --> 1:10:18.170
They shot Drew!

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:20.128
They shot Drew, Pops!

1:10:20.172 --> 1:10:22.348
They shot Drew, Dad!

1:10:22.392 --> 1:10:23.436
They shot him.

1:10:24.350 --> 1:10:25.699
They shot him...

1:10:44.370 --> 1:10:47.591
- First thing I want you to
know is I'm on your side.

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:51.682
I'm here to help.

1:10:53.814 --> 1:10:57.035
But to help you, I'm
gonna need the truth.

1:10:58.645 --> 1:11:00.299
Not someone else's
version of the truth,

1:11:00.343 --> 1:11:02.693
not someone else's
perspective of the truth,

1:11:02.736 --> 1:11:04.347
but exactly what
happened out there,

1:11:04.390 --> 1:11:05.391
and what you did.

1:11:08.655 --> 1:11:14.400
Son, you get one shot
at this, you understand?

1:11:14.444 --> 1:11:15.183
- I understand.

1:11:18.143 --> 1:11:22.147
Officer Eugene and I were
doing what we normally do

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:27.848
that time of day, I noticed
a suspicious looking car,

1:11:27.892 --> 1:11:29.807
so we decided to investigate.

1:11:29.850 --> 1:11:33.463
The driver of the car also
matched the description

1:11:33.506 --> 1:11:35.160
of a person that was
wanted for questioning

1:11:35.203 --> 1:11:37.031
in relation to the stolen car.

1:11:40.165 --> 1:11:44.822
We stopped the car, I
got out of my patrol car

1:11:44.865 --> 1:11:47.128
and asked the driver
of the other car

1:11:47.172 --> 1:11:48.391
to step out of his vehicle.

1:11:49.870 --> 1:11:54.788
He asked why, he
stepped out of his car,

1:11:58.401 --> 1:12:00.751
his voice started to go up,

1:12:00.794 --> 1:12:03.144
and he became aggressive.

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:08.280
I wrestled Mr.
Thomas to the ground

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:09.716
as he continued
to be aggressive.

1:12:12.415 --> 1:12:17.637
A few seconds went by, and I
heard Officer Eugene yelling.

1:12:17.681 --> 1:12:19.509
I don't recall what he said,

1:12:21.162 --> 1:12:24.644
this is when I noticed Drew
Thomas rushing towards me.

1:12:24.688 --> 1:12:26.516
He pulled out what
appeared to be a weapon.

1:12:26.559 --> 1:12:28.256
- I'm gonna stop
you right there.

1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:32.696
There was no weapons
found at the scene, no.

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:37.265
I had six officers patrolling
that place, no weapons.

1:12:37.309 --> 1:12:39.442
They didn't find any weapons.
You know what they did find?

1:12:39.485 --> 1:12:43.620
A blood-stained cell phone
belonging to Drew Thomas.

1:12:46.449 --> 1:12:48.189
- I'm almost positive
I saw a weapon.

1:12:49.713 --> 1:12:52.542
- Is it possible that during
the heat of the moment

1:12:52.585 --> 1:12:55.501
you mistook Mr. Thomas's
cell phone as a weapon.

1:13:01.072 --> 1:13:01.812
- Yeah.

1:13:12.779 --> 1:13:14.390
-  Who's the
family of Drew Thomas?

1:13:14.433 --> 1:13:15.826
- I'm Drew's brother.

1:13:15.869 --> 1:13:17.088
- I'm Drew's father.

1:13:17.131 --> 1:13:18.742
What's going on with my son?

1:13:18.785 --> 1:13:20.352
We've been waiting
here for hours.

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:22.136
- I know.

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:23.529
We were able to stabilize him.

1:13:24.835 --> 1:13:28.099
The bullet entered his
chest, exited his back,

1:13:28.142 --> 1:13:30.144
grazing his spine, he's
lost a lot of blood.

1:13:30.188 --> 1:13:31.798
- Is he gonna be okay?

1:13:31.842 --> 1:13:33.452
Can we see him?

1:13:33.496 --> 1:13:35.106
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

1:13:35.149 --> 1:13:37.456
He has a long road of
recovery in front of him,

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.371
but if he makes it
through the night,

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:41.547
I'll be more optimistic.

1:13:41.591 --> 1:13:43.157
But I have to insist
for right now,

1:13:43.201 --> 1:13:46.030
only one of you could come
back to visit with him.

1:13:46.073 --> 1:13:48.902
Only for a few
minutes, he needs rest.

1:13:48.946 --> 1:13:50.513
- I'm gonna go, son.

1:13:50.556 --> 1:13:51.427
- Yes, Pops.

1:13:51.470 --> 1:13:52.689
- Only for a few minutes.

1:13:52.732 --> 1:13:53.472
- Okay.

1:13:53.516 --> 1:13:54.430
- All right, follow me.

1:15:31.918 --> 1:15:33.267
- Hello?

1:15:33.311 --> 1:15:34.486
- Hey, Trev.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:36.096
That you?

1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:37.794
- Um, yeah it's me.

1:15:37.837 --> 1:15:40.100
Is everything all right?

1:15:40.144 --> 1:15:41.537
- Everything's good.

1:15:41.580 --> 1:15:42.450
Just called to check in.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:46.324
- Uh, okay, hey.

1:15:46.367 --> 1:15:48.021
E.J. just walked in.

1:15:48.065 --> 1:15:49.806
It's your dad.

1:15:49.849 --> 1:15:51.285
- Hey Dad, what's going on?

1:15:51.329 --> 1:15:52.504
- Everything's good.

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:54.854
You guys staying out
of trouble up there?

1:15:54.898 --> 1:15:56.682
- Yeah, yeah, I think.

1:15:56.726 --> 1:15:57.727
Why, what do you mean?

1:15:57.770 --> 1:16:00.033
- Just staying out of trouble,

1:16:00.077 --> 1:16:02.470
being a good student, you know.

1:16:02.514 --> 1:16:03.559
- Everything's fine over here.

1:16:03.602 --> 1:16:04.908
How's mom doing?

1:16:04.951 --> 1:16:06.213
- She's doing good.

1:16:06.257 --> 1:16:08.607
Getting ready to take
a vacation pretty soon.

1:16:08.651 --> 1:16:10.478
Looking forward to
seeing you soon.

1:16:11.741 --> 1:16:12.785
- Yeah, I'm looking
forward to seeing you too.

1:16:12.829 --> 1:16:14.178
Is everything all right?

1:16:14.221 --> 1:16:15.701
You sound a little off.

1:16:15.745 --> 1:16:19.052
- Nothing much, just
wanted to hear your voice.

1:16:19.096 --> 1:16:20.619
I love you, son.

1:16:20.663 --> 1:16:21.577
- Yeah, I love you too.

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.887
- What was that all about?

1:16:27.931 --> 1:16:28.758
- I don't know, man.

1:16:30.194 --> 1:16:31.151
Let's play some pool.

1:17:03.183 --> 1:17:04.750
- Hello, my name is Kent Riley,

1:17:04.794 --> 1:17:06.665
and welcome to the Riley Factor.

1:17:06.709 --> 1:17:08.711
Tonight we'll be discussing
the recent shooting

1:17:08.754 --> 1:17:11.714
of Andrew Thomas, a
black male who was shot

1:17:11.757 --> 1:17:14.499
by a white police officer
in Geffen City, Florida.

1:17:14.542 --> 1:17:17.676
The story has made national
news for obvious reasons,

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:19.373
but this is what we know so far.

1:17:19.417 --> 1:17:21.898
We do know that Andrew
Thomas driving in a vehicle

1:17:21.941 --> 1:17:24.727
that matched the
description of a stolen car.

1:17:24.770 --> 1:17:26.119
This is the reason
they were stopped

1:17:26.163 --> 1:17:27.860
by the patrolling officers.

1:17:27.904 --> 1:17:29.949
The officer whose name
is yet to be revealed

1:17:29.993 --> 1:17:33.692
got into an argument with the
person driving the vehicle.

1:17:33.736 --> 1:17:35.955
This escalated into
a physical fight.

1:17:35.999 --> 1:17:38.741
That's when Andrew Thomas
exited the passenger's side

1:17:38.784 --> 1:17:40.656
and lunged toward the officer.

1:17:40.699 --> 1:17:42.658
The officer then
shot Andrew Thomas,

1:17:42.701 --> 1:17:44.747
hitting him in the abdomen.

1:17:44.790 --> 1:17:46.792
Take a look, here's a
photo that was sent to us

1:17:46.836 --> 1:17:47.837
from an anonymous source.

1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:49.403
- How did they get that photo?

1:17:49.447 --> 1:17:51.797
- They probably got it
off Drew's social media.

1:17:51.841 --> 1:17:54.060
It was just a costume
party, we went as N.W.A.

1:17:56.062 --> 1:17:58.282
They cropped everybody
else out that photo.

1:17:58.325 --> 1:18:02.112
Man, they could've got a
thousand other pictures to use!

1:18:02.155 --> 1:18:04.592
- They're calling my boy a thug.

1:18:04.636 --> 1:18:06.290
If they make Drew
look like a villain,

1:18:06.333 --> 1:18:08.858
the public is gonna
care less about Drew,

1:18:08.901 --> 1:18:12.035
and less about convicting
the cop who shot him.

1:18:14.951 --> 1:18:16.126
- This is wrong, Pops.

1:18:16.169 --> 1:18:17.127
I'm outta here, man.

1:18:21.218 --> 1:18:22.436
-  Let's start with you.

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:24.090
What are your thoughts
on this story?

1:18:24.134 --> 1:18:26.571
- Well, first and
foremost, the car that

1:18:26.614 --> 1:18:29.487
the victim's brother was
driving was not stolen.

1:18:29.530 --> 1:18:31.489
It was registered
to Andrew Thomas.

1:18:31.532 --> 1:18:34.492
Second, the car was stopped
because officers thought

1:18:34.535 --> 1:18:37.190
Theo Thomas looked like
someone who had stolen a car,

1:18:37.234 --> 1:18:40.324
and third, neither
Andrew nor Theo owned

1:18:40.367 --> 1:18:41.978
or was carrying a firearm.

1:18:42.021 --> 1:18:43.109
They were both unarmed.

1:18:43.153 --> 1:18:44.763
- That's all speculation
at this poin,

1:18:44.807 --> 1:18:46.591
none of those details
have been confirmed.

1:18:46.634 --> 1:18:49.246
- I've spoken to the family,
those boys didn't carry guns.

1:18:49.289 --> 1:18:51.901
They were musicians,
they carried instruments.

1:18:51.944 --> 1:18:54.730
- Again, none of those
details have been confirmed.

1:18:54.773 --> 1:18:56.427
- Well, since we're so concerned

1:18:56.470 --> 1:18:58.081
with details being confirmed,

1:18:58.124 --> 1:19:01.214
did the anonymous sources
who gave you that photo

1:19:01.258 --> 1:19:03.173
also tell you that Andrew Thomas

1:19:03.216 --> 1:19:05.653
was a decorated member
of our armed forces,

1:19:05.697 --> 1:19:07.960
who was deployed
for almost a year

1:19:08.004 --> 1:19:09.701
fighting for this country?

1:19:09.745 --> 1:19:11.485
Or that before he
went to Afghanistan,

1:19:11.529 --> 1:19:13.487
he was a community
leader for years,

1:19:13.531 --> 1:19:15.446
volunteering at an
after school program?

1:19:15.489 --> 1:19:17.883
- Well, that all sounds
great on a resume,

1:19:17.927 --> 1:19:21.539
but explain Mr. Thomas
lunging toward an officer.

1:19:21.582 --> 1:19:22.845
Explain that.

1:19:22.888 --> 1:19:23.976
- The truth about
what really happened

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:25.761
will come out eventually.

1:19:25.804 --> 1:19:27.240
- As it always does.

1:19:27.284 --> 1:19:28.851
I'd like to turn
it over to Paige.

1:19:28.894 --> 1:19:31.723
What are your thoughts on
what's unraveling in Geffen?

1:19:31.767 --> 1:19:33.899
- Well, I agree with
Tamara in the sense that

1:19:33.943 --> 1:19:35.988
we do not want to paint
an inaccurate picture

1:19:36.032 --> 1:19:37.642
of Mr. Thomas.

1:19:37.685 --> 1:19:39.644
But more importantly, I
think we should be focusing

1:19:39.687 --> 1:19:41.428
the conversation on the officer

1:19:41.472 --> 1:19:43.735
who shall remain
nameless, I guess.

1:19:43.779 --> 1:19:45.476
Why haven't they
released his name?

1:19:45.519 --> 1:19:48.044
How do we have so much
information on Mr. Thomas,

1:19:48.087 --> 1:19:49.959
yet nothing on the officers?

1:19:50.002 --> 1:19:52.788
What was going on through
the officer's mind?

1:19:52.831 --> 1:19:55.138
- The Geffen City Police
Department has not revealed

1:19:55.181 --> 1:19:57.836
the name of the officer
who shot Mr. Thomas,

1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:00.621
however, we have discovered
who his partner is.

1:20:00.665 --> 1:20:03.320
Officer Eugene Travis,
a 20 year veteran

1:20:03.363 --> 1:20:04.974
with an exemplary record,

1:20:05.017 --> 1:20:08.064
who has dedicated his life
to serving his community.

1:20:08.107 --> 1:20:09.805
And who's to say the
other officer involved

1:20:09.848 --> 1:20:11.197
didn't have the same record?

1:20:37.963 --> 1:20:39.660
- The car was stopped
because officers thought

1:20:39.704 --> 1:20:42.402
Theo Thomas looked like
someone who had stolen a car.

1:20:42.446 --> 1:20:45.492
And third, neither
Andrew nor Theo owned

1:20:45.536 --> 1:20:48.147
or was carrying a firearm,
they were both unarmed.

1:20:48.191 --> 1:20:49.975
- That's all speculation
at that point,

1:20:50.019 --> 1:20:51.716
none of those details
have been confirmed.

1:20:51.759 --> 1:20:52.848
- I've spoken to the family,

1:20:52.891 --> 1:20:54.414
those boys didn't carry guns.

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:56.808
They were musicians,
they carried instruments.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:20:59.942
- Again, none of those
details have been confirmed.

1:20:59.985 --> 1:21:01.595
- Well, since we're so concerned

1:21:01.639 --> 1:21:02.814
with details being confirmed--

1:21:02.858 --> 1:21:04.511
- That's no good.

1:21:04.555 --> 1:21:06.426
- Did the anonymous sources
who gave you that photo--

1:21:06.470 --> 1:21:08.341
- We gotta get
ahead of this, ASAP.

1:21:08.385 --> 1:21:10.822
- Was a decorated member
of our armed forces,

1:21:10.866 --> 1:21:12.824
who was deployed
for almost a year.

1:21:12.868 --> 1:21:14.130
- Theo, this is Eric.

1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:17.133
Listen, I know this is
probably not the best time

1:21:17.176 --> 1:21:18.830
to be delivering this news,

1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:20.527
but we're gonna have to hold
off on releasing the grant.

1:21:20.571 --> 1:21:23.704
Just until everything
clears up with you and Drew.

1:21:27.404 --> 1:21:29.972
There's been some
conflicting reports.

1:21:30.015 --> 1:21:30.842
We have to protect our brand

1:21:30.886 --> 1:21:32.844
from any potential bad press.

1:21:32.888 --> 1:21:34.977
We still believe in you.

1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:36.979
Our thoughts and our prayers
are with you and your family.

1:21:37.022 --> 1:21:38.719
I'll talk to you
soon, all right?

1:23:20.691 --> 1:23:23.607
- Why are you following me?
Why are you following me?

1:23:23.650 --> 1:23:24.782
- Drew Thomas is my son.

1:23:26.001 --> 1:23:28.133
I'm trying to find the
person who shot him.

1:23:45.150 --> 1:23:45.890
- Hey.

1:23:47.457 --> 1:23:49.459
You know we can cover for you,
you don't have to be here.

1:23:49.502 --> 1:23:51.504
- Yeah, I know, Trace.

1:23:51.548 --> 1:23:53.506
This is the only place
I can find peace.

1:23:55.030 --> 1:23:57.336
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

1:23:58.859 --> 1:24:00.861
I can't stop thinking
about what happened.

1:24:02.124 --> 1:24:03.560
You know, and besides that,

1:24:03.603 --> 1:24:06.128
Eric called and said that
he's gonna have to hold off

1:24:06.171 --> 1:24:07.085
on releasing the grant.

1:24:08.391 --> 1:24:10.045
He said he wants to
protect his brand.

1:24:13.874 --> 1:24:15.050
It's just, I don't know man.

1:24:16.660 --> 1:24:20.185
He just wants to wait
'til everything dies down,

1:24:20.229 --> 1:24:21.665
whatever that means.

1:24:25.016 --> 1:24:28.237
Everything was going so good.

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:30.935
And now I just feel like
we're dead in the water, man.

1:24:41.946 --> 1:24:43.034
- How did you find me?

1:24:44.644 --> 1:24:45.428
- Kent Riley.

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:48.170
He had your name
and face plastered

1:24:48.213 --> 1:24:50.998
all over his report, for
the entire world to see.

1:24:51.042 --> 1:24:52.565
- What do you want from us?

1:24:52.609 --> 1:24:53.871
- I want answers.

1:24:54.741 --> 1:24:56.221
Who shot my son?

1:24:57.918 --> 1:25:01.008
People are saying that my
son may have had a weapon.

1:25:01.052 --> 1:25:02.619
My son doesn't
even own a weapon.

1:25:04.055 --> 1:25:07.058
And the media's trying to
make him look like a thug.

1:25:07.102 --> 1:25:09.060
Drew is no thug.

1:25:09.104 --> 1:25:11.149
He was a good kid.

1:25:11.193 --> 1:25:12.150
And why won't they
release the name

1:25:12.194 --> 1:25:14.239
of the officer who shot him?

1:25:14.283 --> 1:25:15.893
- The department
can't screw this up.

1:25:15.936 --> 1:25:16.850
They're trying to be cautious.

1:25:16.894 --> 1:25:17.938
- Can't mess this up?

1:25:17.982 --> 1:25:18.939
My son almost...

1:25:21.899 --> 1:25:23.988
My son almost died out there.

1:25:24.031 --> 1:25:25.990
They already messed this up.

1:25:26.033 --> 1:25:28.079
- Before the department
releases any information,

1:25:28.123 --> 1:25:29.907
they're gonna try to find
anything on your son.

1:25:29.950 --> 1:25:31.256
They'll use whatever
they can find,

1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:33.693
protect themselves, and
protect Officer Tyler.

1:25:33.737 --> 1:25:35.869
The Blue Line's gonna
protect the Blue Line.

1:25:35.913 --> 1:25:36.566
- Tyler.

1:25:38.568 --> 1:25:40.744
That's the officer's name?

1:25:40.787 --> 1:25:42.485
- And he's not what you
may be thinking he is.

1:25:42.528 --> 1:25:43.225
He's a good kid.

1:25:45.009 --> 1:25:46.576
- A good kid?

1:25:46.619 --> 1:25:49.492
What good kid shoots
an unarmed man?

1:25:49.535 --> 1:25:51.407
- A good kid who got
scared and panicked.

1:25:51.450 --> 1:25:52.843
I could see it in his eyes.

1:25:52.886 --> 1:25:54.801
He panicked and
pulled the trigger.

1:25:54.845 --> 1:25:57.152
If he could go back in time
and take that day back,

1:25:57.195 --> 1:25:58.153
trust me, he would.

1:25:58.196 --> 1:25:59.806
- He can't take it back.

1:25:59.850 --> 1:26:02.200
And my son is on life support,

1:26:02.244 --> 1:26:03.680
because Officer Tyler panicked?

1:26:05.899 --> 1:26:09.294
I want to meet him,
look him in his eyes.

1:26:09.338 --> 1:26:12.950
- That's not a good idea,
this wasn't a good idea.

1:26:12.993 --> 1:26:14.952
- Then why are you still
here talking to me?

1:26:20.087 --> 1:26:22.786
- You know, our
son just turned 20.

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:25.876
He's a couple years
younger than your son,

1:26:25.919 --> 1:26:27.182
kinda looks like him too.

1:26:29.227 --> 1:26:31.882
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

1:26:33.318 --> 1:26:36.234
But if it means anything,
I've been praying for him,

1:26:36.278 --> 1:26:37.148
and your family.

1:26:42.980 --> 1:26:45.112
- Thank you, that
means a lot to me.

1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:50.509
- I'll reach out
to Officer Tyler.

1:26:50.553 --> 1:26:51.771
If he wants to speak with you,

1:26:51.815 --> 1:26:53.208
then I'll arrange a meeting.

1:26:53.251 --> 1:26:54.426
It'll more than
likely have to be

1:26:54.470 --> 1:26:56.211
at a place he chooses
and a time he chooses.

1:26:57.951 --> 1:27:00.258
I can lose my job and
my pension for this.

1:27:00.302 --> 1:27:03.783
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1:27:03.827 --> 1:27:04.480
- I hear you.

1:27:05.568 --> 1:27:06.917
No one can know about this.

1:27:10.225 --> 1:27:11.922
Nice meeting you, Harriet.

1:27:38.253 --> 1:27:39.254
- Mr. Thomas.

1:27:39.297 --> 1:27:40.429
- Officer Eugene.

1:27:45.303 --> 1:27:46.217
- How you feelin'?

1:27:46.261 --> 1:27:47.740
- As good as can be expected.

1:27:49.046 --> 1:27:50.874
Seemed like a good
idea a few days ago,

1:27:50.917 --> 1:27:52.745
but now, I don't know.

1:27:54.094 --> 1:27:55.574
- I gotta tell you, Daniel,

1:27:55.618 --> 1:27:57.272
I didn't think this was a
great idea at first either,

1:27:57.315 --> 1:27:58.534
but I may have been wrong.

1:27:58.577 --> 1:28:00.187
It may good for
you know that Tyler

1:28:00.231 --> 1:28:01.188
isn't some vigilante
cop out here

1:28:01.232 --> 1:28:03.365
looking for people to shoot.

1:28:03.408 --> 1:28:05.192
I hope you get what
you need from this.

1:28:05.236 --> 1:28:06.585
Come on, follow me.

1:28:17.204 --> 1:28:18.597
Tyler, Emma.

1:28:19.685 --> 1:28:20.817
It's Daniel Thomas.

1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:25.256
- You're the gentleman
from the repair shop.

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:28.390
- This is an odd coincidence.

1:28:28.433 --> 1:28:31.262
Emma, if I'm not mistaken.

1:28:32.437 --> 1:28:34.309
- Yeah, that's it.

1:28:34.352 --> 1:28:35.397
- You guys know each other?

1:28:37.442 --> 1:28:40.445
- Mr. Thomas runs
the repair shop.

1:28:40.489 --> 1:28:42.229
A few days ago
when our car died,

1:28:42.273 --> 1:28:45.407
he helped me get it
towed and repaired.

1:28:45.450 --> 1:28:46.233
- Small world.

1:28:47.670 --> 1:28:51.456
- Mr. Thomas, this
is my husband, Tyler.

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:53.937
- Mr. Thomas, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

1:28:57.375 --> 1:28:59.464
- That's not what
I came here for.

1:29:04.382 --> 1:29:07.994
- Mr. Thomas, I
would give anything

1:29:08.038 --> 1:29:09.648
to take back what I did.

1:29:09.692 --> 1:29:11.433
There's not a day that goes by

1:29:11.476 --> 1:29:14.479
that I don't regret
what happened.

1:29:14.523 --> 1:29:16.742
It haunts me every
day, and it should.

1:29:20.137 --> 1:29:22.052
Saying sorry won't fix this.

1:29:23.314 --> 1:29:27.187
It won't turn back
time, but sir...

1:29:32.584 --> 1:29:36.022
I'm so sorry for all of it.

1:29:37.372 --> 1:29:38.895
You have to know, I don't
wake up in the morning

1:29:38.938 --> 1:29:41.463
hating anyone,
that's not who I am.

1:29:46.555 --> 1:29:48.383
- Did my son point
a weapon at you?

1:29:52.604 --> 1:29:53.388
- No.

1:29:54.780 --> 1:29:58.393
No, there was no gun
found, he was unarmed.

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.140
- You all expecting
someone else?

1:30:07.184 --> 1:30:08.359
I'll go check it out.

1:30:18.413 --> 1:30:19.762
Can I help you?

1:30:19.805 --> 1:30:21.372
- What the hell
are you doing here?

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:23.069
- It's a free country, I'm
here visiting a friend.

1:30:23.113 --> 1:30:24.593
- That's exactly
what it better be.

1:30:26.159 --> 1:30:27.857
Where's Tyler?

1:30:27.900 --> 1:30:29.032
- He's over here.

1:30:29.075 --> 1:30:30.425
- You, don't move.

1:30:30.468 --> 1:30:32.252
When I'm done with Tyler,
I'm gonna talk to you.

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:39.390
- You picked the wrong day.

1:30:39.434 --> 1:30:40.826
- You're under arrest
for aggravated assault

1:30:40.870 --> 1:30:42.175
with a deadly weapon.

1:30:42.219 --> 1:30:43.525
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:30:43.568 --> 1:30:44.874
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1:30:44.917 --> 1:30:45.657
in a court of law--

1:30:45.701 --> 1:30:46.571
- No, no, no.

1:30:46.615 --> 1:30:47.877
- You the right to an attorney.

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:48.443
- You don't have
to handcuff him--

1:30:48.486 --> 1:30:50.488
- Son, son, son.

1:30:50.532 --> 1:30:51.533
Calm her down.

1:30:51.576 --> 1:30:52.708
- It's gonna be okay.

1:30:52.751 --> 1:30:54.187
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

1:30:54.231 --> 1:30:55.754
- Take him to the car.
- Let's go.

1:30:55.798 --> 1:30:56.886
- Ma'am, you need to calm down.

1:30:56.929 --> 1:30:58.235
- Wait, wait, wait, wait--

1:30:58.278 --> 1:30:59.628
- You need to calm down
and sit down right--

1:30:59.671 --> 1:31:03.066
- Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

1:32:14.267 --> 1:32:15.617
- All right, everybody.

1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:16.879
Today we have a
very special guest

1:32:16.922 --> 1:32:19.446
for our very first dance class.

1:32:19.490 --> 1:32:22.058
She is one of the best
dancers that I have ever

1:32:22.101 --> 1:32:23.668
had the privilege of watching.

1:32:23.712 --> 1:32:24.930
So what she's gonna do

1:32:24.974 --> 1:32:27.150
is she's gonna perform
a song to dance,

1:32:27.193 --> 1:32:28.717
and then she's gonna
answer questions

1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:31.023
on pretty much how to
become awesome as a dancer.

1:32:31.067 --> 1:32:32.329
Does that sound good?

1:32:32.372 --> 1:32:33.504
-  Yeah!

1:32:33.548 --> 1:32:34.679
- All right, so
let's give it up,

1:32:34.723 --> 1:32:37.334
a very warm welcome to
our very own Miss Kenya!

1:32:40.250 --> 1:32:41.033
- Hey.

1:32:41.077 --> 1:32:42.687
Aw, thank you.

1:32:42.731 --> 1:32:44.602
It's such a privilege to be here

1:32:44.646 --> 1:32:47.518
with such talented
young people today.

1:32:47.562 --> 1:32:49.259
You know, Theo has
told me so many

1:32:49.302 --> 1:32:51.261
great things about you all.

1:32:51.304 --> 1:32:54.438
And today, I will
perform a modern dance

1:32:54.481 --> 1:32:56.571
inspired by love and hope.

1:33:46.533 --> 1:33:47.709
- Hey man, what's up?

1:33:47.752 --> 1:33:49.536
- Have you been checking
the donations account?

1:33:49.580 --> 1:33:51.538
- No, are we overdrawn?

1:33:51.582 --> 1:33:53.889
- You have to take
a look at this.

1:33:53.932 --> 1:33:55.020
- Is this real?

1:33:55.978 --> 1:33:56.805
- Have we been hacked?

1:33:56.848 --> 1:33:58.371
Is this like a joke?

1:33:58.415 --> 1:34:00.373
- No, this is real.

1:34:00.417 --> 1:34:02.549
100%, I've checked.

1:34:02.593 --> 1:34:04.334
In the last week or
so, we've received

1:34:04.377 --> 1:34:06.902
almost a million dollars
in online donations.

1:34:06.945 --> 1:34:08.251
- Oh my goodness.

1:34:08.294 --> 1:34:09.556
- People must've heard
about us on the news.

1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:10.862
-  Oh my gosh.

1:34:10.906 --> 1:34:12.603
- Is this all from one person?

1:34:12.647 --> 1:34:13.517
-  Oh my goodness.

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:14.692
- No, no, no, look.

1:34:14.736 --> 1:34:17.042
It's small donations,
it's 20 and 50 dollars,

1:34:17.086 --> 1:34:18.870
from people all
over the country.

1:34:18.914 --> 1:34:21.090
There's 20 from
Jason in Little Rock,

1:34:21.133 --> 1:34:23.483
25 from Christie in San Antonio.

1:34:23.527 --> 1:34:24.876
- Oh my good, oh my goodness.

1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.791
- There are donations coming
in from other countries.

1:34:26.835 --> 1:34:28.140
- Chris--

1:34:28.184 --> 1:34:29.054
- This is almost twice
as much as we'd of gotten

1:34:29.098 --> 1:34:30.360
if we'd of gotten that grant.

1:34:30.403 --> 1:34:33.798
- Dude, God made a
way, he made a way.

1:34:33.842 --> 1:34:35.670
Oh my goodness.

1:34:43.155 --> 1:34:45.505
I have a confession
to make, little bro.

1:34:48.073 --> 1:34:49.205
I was about to give up.

1:34:51.773 --> 1:34:55.559
I was about to let
mom and dad down,

1:34:55.602 --> 1:34:58.518
let you down, and let
all those kids down.

1:34:59.781 --> 1:35:01.608
And I know this
sounds crazy but,

1:35:03.001 --> 1:35:06.788
I was about to be on that
midnight train to Georgia.

1:35:06.831 --> 1:35:10.661
The idea of you not
making it out of this

1:35:10.705 --> 1:35:11.706
was just too much.

1:35:14.796 --> 1:35:15.884
Then Eric pulled the grant,

1:35:17.755 --> 1:35:20.018
said they had to
protect their brand,

1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:24.719
then I just started
feeling sorry for myself.

1:35:26.721 --> 1:35:28.505
I'm sorry for ever
thinking like that.

1:35:30.550 --> 1:35:32.509
I'm sorry for ever losing faith.

1:35:40.735 --> 1:35:43.563
I had a dream the other
day, a crazy dream.

1:35:43.607 --> 1:35:44.782
I'll tell you about it later.

1:35:46.131 --> 1:35:47.611
I want you to know something.

1:35:50.396 --> 1:35:51.746
That no matter what happens,

1:35:51.789 --> 1:35:53.878
what we started will continue,

1:35:55.619 --> 1:35:57.229
and I'm not gonna give up.

1:35:58.753 --> 1:36:03.148
That we're not gonna give up,
and that your spot is open.

1:36:03.192 --> 1:36:04.846
And that we're gonna
hold it down until

1:36:07.849 --> 1:36:10.547
you're ready to get back
in there, little bro.

1:36:14.464 --> 1:36:15.204
I love you, Drew.

1:36:44.886 --> 1:36:46.496
Today is a dream come true.

1:36:47.889 --> 1:36:51.109
Not only for myself,
but for my family,

1:36:51.153 --> 1:36:53.808
my friends, my colleagues,

1:36:53.851 --> 1:36:54.896
and the amazing group of kids

1:36:54.939 --> 1:36:57.507
we get to work with
on a daily basis.

1:36:57.550 --> 1:36:59.726
We get to do what we love to do,

1:36:59.770 --> 1:37:03.034
while simultaneously giving
back to the community.

1:37:03.078 --> 1:37:04.819
The community we grew up in.

1:37:04.862 --> 1:37:07.865
We feel that it is
within ourselves

1:37:07.909 --> 1:37:09.693
to empower our community,

1:37:09.736 --> 1:37:12.609
and to enable our city.

1:37:12.652 --> 1:37:14.829
This is why the program exists.

1:37:14.872 --> 1:37:17.266
If we can empower
this generation,

1:37:17.309 --> 1:37:20.443
then this generation
can empower the next.

1:37:20.486 --> 1:37:21.923
- For the last six years,

1:37:21.966 --> 1:37:23.750
we've been working
tirelessly to create

1:37:23.794 --> 1:37:25.665
an after school
program that not only

1:37:25.709 --> 1:37:27.493
keeps our kids off the streets,

1:37:27.537 --> 1:37:29.713
but also equips them
with practical tools

1:37:29.756 --> 1:37:31.410
they can use to
enhance their lives

1:37:31.454 --> 1:37:32.977
and the lives of others.

1:37:33.021 --> 1:37:35.458
This program started
with just one class,

1:37:35.501 --> 1:37:37.460
taught by Theo Thomas.

1:37:37.503 --> 1:37:39.070
We still offer that music class

1:37:39.114 --> 1:37:43.596
along with art, dance,
voice, physical education,

1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:46.556
mathematics, English,
and creative writing.

1:37:46.599 --> 1:37:48.993
- And we could not have done
this without all of you.

1:37:49.037 --> 1:37:50.821
Thank you to all the volunteers

1:37:50.865 --> 1:37:53.737
who have been helping
keep us afloat.

1:37:53.780 --> 1:37:56.522
Helping us out whenever
we were short staffed.

1:37:56.566 --> 1:37:58.220
Thanks to the parents
who've been trusting us

1:37:58.263 --> 1:37:59.874
with their kids for
all of these years.

1:37:59.917 --> 1:38:00.962
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:38:01.005 --> 1:38:02.833
- And thank you,
thank you to everyone

1:38:02.877 --> 1:38:05.053
who donated to this cause.

1:38:05.096 --> 1:38:08.012
It was overwhelming to
see how many people gave,

1:38:08.056 --> 1:38:10.014
how many people actually
cared about this.

1:38:11.537 --> 1:38:13.583
You know, before I
start to ramble on,

1:38:13.626 --> 1:38:15.759
I want to give the mic
to the guy who said,

1:38:17.065 --> 1:38:19.589
"We should start an
after school program."

1:38:19.632 --> 1:38:23.158
My brother, my
friend, Drew Thomas.

1:38:36.127 --> 1:38:37.999
- Thank you for
the introduction,

1:38:38.042 --> 1:38:40.566
but I don't want to
make this about me.

1:38:40.610 --> 1:38:41.959
This is about these
wonderful kids

1:38:42.003 --> 1:38:45.006
and this great program
that was created for them.

1:38:45.049 --> 1:38:46.833
This is about investing
in the future,

1:38:46.877 --> 1:38:48.923
the future of our community,

1:38:48.966 --> 1:38:51.273
because it has to start with us.

1:38:51.316 --> 1:38:52.970
If we want to see change,

1:38:53.014 --> 1:38:55.842
we have to make those
changes for ourselves.

1:38:55.886 --> 1:38:57.496
And these kids show
up here every day

1:38:57.540 --> 1:38:59.803
because they want to
grow, they want to evolve,

1:38:59.846 --> 1:39:00.935
and they want to change.

1:39:02.719 --> 1:39:04.939
And I'm so grateful I still
get to be a part of that.

1:39:06.723 --> 1:39:09.073
I promised myself I wouldn't
get too emotional but,

1:39:10.683 --> 1:39:13.338
like my brother said,
this is a dream come true.

1:39:15.384 --> 1:39:18.343
So, without further ado--

1:39:19.866 --> 1:39:23.958
- Welcome to the new Clear
Path after school program.

1:39:33.750 --> 1:39:35.186
- Ladies and gentlemen, it's
such a pleasure and honor

1:39:35.230 --> 1:39:36.709
to have you here
at the table today

1:39:36.753 --> 1:39:38.755
to discuss the
situation that happened,

1:39:38.798 --> 1:39:41.627
I really believe the
answers and the solutions

1:39:41.671 --> 1:39:42.933
that we provide today

1:39:42.977 --> 1:39:45.109
are literally gonna have
global implications.

1:39:45.153 --> 1:39:46.502
The problem that we face

1:39:46.545 --> 1:39:48.025
and the thing that
we went through

1:39:48.069 --> 1:39:50.027
is something that is happening
all around the world,

1:39:50.071 --> 1:39:51.768
and we're gonna get
to make a different.

1:39:51.811 --> 1:39:53.204
-  Yes, sir.

1:39:53.248 --> 1:39:54.466
- We're really grateful
that we can use this for--

1:39:54.510 --> 1:39:55.163
- Tyler Garett.

1:39:58.035 --> 1:39:59.080
You wanted to meet me?

1:40:01.038 --> 1:40:02.213
- Yes.

1:40:02.257 --> 1:40:03.171
I wanted to meet you.

1:40:04.781 --> 1:40:07.088
To look you in the eyes,
and tell you how sorry I am

1:40:07.131 --> 1:40:08.785
for what happened.

1:40:08.828 --> 1:40:09.829
I'm sorry for all of it.

1:40:12.310 --> 1:40:13.616
I look at that day and--

1:40:13.659 --> 1:40:17.663
- Tyler, I've forgiven
you, a while ago.

1:40:19.578 --> 1:40:22.625
You know, holding on to
that anger and that hate,

1:40:22.668 --> 1:40:23.974
it was like a poison to me.

1:40:25.019 --> 1:40:26.237
And I had to release it.

1:40:27.543 --> 1:40:30.502
But forgiving you,
it's not enough.

1:40:31.938 --> 1:40:34.071
We need to work together
to figure out solutions

1:40:34.115 --> 1:40:37.509
so this never happens again.

1:40:38.423 --> 1:40:39.250
- I agree.

1:40:40.121 --> 1:40:42.079
Let's figure this thing out.

1:40:42.123 --> 1:40:43.689
- Let's figure it out.

1:41:19.464 --> 1:41:21.162
Now is the time

1:41:21.205 --> 1:41:25.383
to lift our nation from the
quicksands of racial injustice

1:41:25.427 --> 1:41:27.124
to the solid rock
of brotherhood.

1:41:27.168 --> 1:41:28.821
Now is the time!

1:41:32.869 --> 1:41:37.439
There will be neither rest
nor tranquility in America

1:41:37.482 --> 1:41:41.530
until the Negro is granted
his citizenship rights.

1:41:41.573 --> 1:41:44.402
The whirlwinds of revolt
will continue to shake

1:41:44.446 --> 1:41:46.883
the foundations of our nation,

1:41:46.926 --> 1:41:49.973
until the bright days
of justice emerges.

1:41:52.584 --> 1:41:56.022
We must not be guilty
of wrongful deeds.

1:41:57.372 --> 1:42:01.463
Let us not seek to satisfy
our thirst for freedom

1:42:01.506 --> 1:42:05.510
by drinking from the cup
of bitterness and hatred.

1:42:08.122 --> 1:42:11.473
We must forever conduct our
struggle on the high plane

1:42:11.516 --> 1:42:14.084
of dignity and discipline.

1:42:14.128 --> 1:42:18.871
We must not allow our
creative protest to degenerate

1:42:18.915 --> 1:42:21.091
into physical violence.

1:42:21.135 --> 1:42:26.662
Again and again we must
rise to the majestic heights

1:42:26.705 --> 1:42:30.535
of meeting physical
force with soul force.

1:42:30.579 --> 1:42:34.191
The marvelous new militancy
which has engulfed

1:42:34.235 --> 1:42:38.543
the Negro community must
not lead us to a distrust

1:42:38.587 --> 1:42:39.979
of all white people,

1:42:40.023 --> 1:42:42.286
for many of our white brothers,

1:42:42.330 --> 1:42:44.636
as evidenced by their
presence here today,

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.117
have come to realize
that their destiny

1:42:47.161 --> 1:42:49.424
is tied up with our destiny.

1:42:52.688 --> 1:42:54.516
Now is the time.

1:43:16.886 --> 1:43:18.061
Now is the time.

1:43:43.956 --> 1:43:45.088
Now is the time.

1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:12.202
Now is the time.
