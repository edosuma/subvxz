00:00.501 --> 00:01.979
Faye: Previously on
"the secret circle..."

00:02.079 --> 00:03.495
Hello?
I got a flat.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.321
Where are you?
Close. I'm on Oak--

00:06.323 --> 00:08.373
[static] Cassie?
Mom?

00:09.258 --> 00:11.209
[Gasps]

00:11.211 --> 00:13.879
[Screaming]

00:18.384 --> 00:20.802
Drowning the demon
is the only way to save Nick.

00:20.804 --> 00:23.138
Tonight isn't about you.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.874
It's a wake for Nick,
and I loved him.

00:25.876 --> 00:29.110
John Blackwell
is my father.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.631
Promise me that you will
stay away from him.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.149
I will.

00:34.151 --> 00:35.817
Adam lifted
the cloaking spell.

00:35.819 --> 00:37.435
I think we found
the last crystal.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.221
It's somewhere in
the high school.

00:39.223 --> 00:40.989
I can't stop all
the witch hunters,

00:40.991 --> 00:42.290
and they're using magic,

00:42.292 --> 00:44.242
which means one of us
is working for them.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.077
Cassie:
The traitor.

00:48.631 --> 00:49.781
Diana: Nick?

00:50.683 --> 00:52.851
[Crickets]

00:54.053 --> 00:57.706
There's no way
you saw Nick.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.140
He's dead.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.475
It was Nick.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.677
He even had a picture
of our parents.

01:02.679 --> 01:04.462
This is impossible,

01:04.464 --> 01:06.681
even by
our insane standards.

01:06.683 --> 01:08.233
Maybe not.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.669
It's possible that
when Nick drowned,

01:10.671 --> 01:12.087
the demon didn't.

01:12.089 --> 01:13.772
And it kept
his body alive.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.590
Looks like
our insane standards

01:15.592 --> 01:17.309
just got
a lot insaner.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.995
The point is
Nick is alive.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.697
But he's not
the same Nick we know.

01:22.699 --> 01:24.199
I saw him.

01:24.201 --> 01:25.417
He definitely seems more

01:25.419 --> 01:27.369
into massacring people
than he used to.

01:27.371 --> 01:28.787
He's killing
witch hunters.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.955
Isn't that what
we're trying to do?

01:29.957 --> 01:32.591
They were mauled,
like by an animal.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.759
Since when
do animals want crystals?

01:34.761 --> 01:38.146
Guys, Nick is stuck
in a nightmare.

01:38.148 --> 01:41.016
He is probably lost and scared
and disoriented.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.133
We need to help him.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.969
Whatever it is,
whoever he is,

01:43.971 --> 01:45.420
it's not Nick.

01:45.422 --> 01:48.974
It is not that
black-and-white, Jake.

01:48.976 --> 01:52.327
Death?
Yeah, it is.

01:59.435 --> 02:00.569
She loved him.

02:00.571 --> 02:02.237
She needs to move on.

02:04.574 --> 02:06.324
Guys...Diana.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.327
Can I talk to you,
please?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.296
No. I'm here for them.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.164
The less I have to talk
to you, the better.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.000
Diana--

02:15.002 --> 02:16.551
Cassie, I know you want
to believe him,

02:16.553 --> 02:19.054
but I don't trust him
any more than I did before.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.840
Diana--
she's...

02:21.842 --> 02:23.625
She's still
adjusting

02:23.627 --> 02:27.128
to this whole
father-daughter thing.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.600
We need her to assemble
the crystal skull.

02:31.602 --> 02:33.318
Without the skull,

02:33.320 --> 02:35.770
we can't stop Eben and the
witch hunters from killing us.

02:35.772 --> 02:37.822
Don't we need to find
the last crystal first?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.141
Adam and Melissa
uncloaked it.

02:40.143 --> 02:41.610
They did?

02:41.612 --> 02:42.994
But all we know is that

02:42.996 --> 02:45.163
it's somewhere in
the high school.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.000
But Balcoin blood has
a special connection to the crystals.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.503
It should pinpoint
it's exact location.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.154
It can lead you
right to it.

02:53.156 --> 02:54.372
So what do we do?

02:54.374 --> 02:56.708
Not us, you.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.294
I can't be caught
roaming around the halls.

02:59.296 --> 03:01.880
Ok.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.466
Give me your hand.

03:04.468 --> 03:06.601
That.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.671
Use your own blood to draw this
symbol somewhere in the school.

03:09.673 --> 03:11.389
4 points of the compass,

03:11.391 --> 03:14.059
and a line across the bottom
to connect you to the crystal.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.111
Its energy should lead
you right to it.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.697
No chanting?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.065
No ancient languages?
No.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.733
Piece of cake.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.320
Cassie...

03:25.322 --> 03:27.522
You know I want what's
best for you and Diana.

03:27.524 --> 03:30.959
All of you.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.627

Original Air Date on May 3, 2012

05:01.141 --> 05:03.359
She seemed so real,

05:03.361 --> 05:04.694
holding the crystal

05:04.696 --> 05:06.896
right in
the hallway.

05:06.898 --> 05:08.981
And she was looking
for your mom.

05:08.983 --> 05:11.317
Did you see--
no.

05:11.319 --> 05:14.353
But my mother was talking to
her like she was right there.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.607
The spell didn't just show me
where the crystal was--

05:18.609 --> 05:22.495
it showed me everything that
was happening around it.

05:22.497 --> 05:25.781
I only saw a tiny piece of
what was going on.

05:25.783 --> 05:29.118
But maybe together...

05:29.120 --> 05:32.388
We could see more.

05:32.390 --> 05:35.258
You want me to go
back in time with you?

05:35.260 --> 05:37.043
Well, we need
to find the crystal.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.963
And you might be able
to see your mom.

05:42.483 --> 05:44.484
I don't want anything to do
with dark magic.

05:44.486 --> 05:46.686
You don't have to.
All we need is your blood.

05:46.688 --> 05:50.639
So you can keep
your moral outrage intact.

05:54.811 --> 05:56.462
Ok.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.367
Tomorrow night's
prom.

06:01.369 --> 06:02.785
So the school
will be open.

06:02.787 --> 06:04.253
Everyone will be
distracted.

06:04.255 --> 06:07.840
With the best night
of the school year.

06:07.842 --> 06:11.210
I've never been
to a prom.

06:11.212 --> 06:15.214
It usually doesn't involve
ancient crystals and time travel.

06:17.634 --> 06:19.385
[Sighs]

06:20.988 --> 06:24.891
What you said to Melissa was worse
than your usual insensitivity.

06:24.893 --> 06:26.526
I don't want her
to get hurt.

06:26.528 --> 06:27.777
Getting emotional over this
only makes her distractible.

06:27.779 --> 06:30.563
And by this,
you mean Nick, right?

06:30.565 --> 06:33.149
Look, I know that

06:33.151 --> 06:36.285
talking things out
isn't really our style,

06:36.287 --> 06:39.989
but I think that this is affecting
you more than you realize.

06:39.991 --> 06:41.741
You've got that look.
What look?

06:41.743 --> 06:43.793
That look like you're about
to invade a small country

06:43.795 --> 06:45.745
with nothing but
your tortured soul.

06:45.747 --> 06:49.665
You're right, Faye, I don't
want to talk about it.

06:55.639 --> 06:58.541
Whoa. What have you
got there, Rambo?

07:00.260 --> 07:02.428
Protection.

07:02.430 --> 07:04.597
If Nick comes back
looking for the crystal,

07:04.599 --> 07:08.317
I don't want us to end up
like those guys at the carnival.

07:14.241 --> 07:18.444
Hey. I missed you
at dinner last night.

07:18.446 --> 07:21.280
I made my world famous
grilled cheese sandwiches.

07:21.282 --> 07:25.501
I was with Cassie.
I had to, um, finish a report.

07:25.503 --> 07:27.503
Was Blackwell there?

07:27.505 --> 07:29.121
Don't worry, Dad.

07:29.123 --> 07:31.541
I'm staying away from
him, just like you said.

07:33.677 --> 07:36.178
Are you going to
the prom tonight?

07:36.180 --> 07:37.547
Yes, and he's not
going to be there.

07:37.549 --> 07:40.299
That's not
why I'm asking.

07:40.301 --> 07:42.852
What is this?

07:45.689 --> 07:47.473
That was
your mother's.

07:47.475 --> 07:50.660
And I thought
you might like to wear it.

07:54.731 --> 07:56.866
I love it.

07:56.868 --> 07:59.035
Thank you so much.

08:01.488 --> 08:03.623
And why don't I give you
a ride to school?

08:03.625 --> 08:06.042
I have an early meeting,
so it's easy.

08:06.044 --> 08:07.627
God, it's been ages
since you've done that.

08:07.629 --> 08:09.829
I'm fine driving
on my own.

08:11.114 --> 08:13.282
But sure.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.950
That would be nice.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.470
Let's hurry up.

Diana and I can find
an empty classroom,

08:30.318 --> 08:32.735
see where my mom took
the crystal.

08:32.736 --> 08:35.520
The rest of us will keep
an eye out for Nick.

08:35.523 --> 08:37.239
Hey, do you want
a ride tonight?

08:37.241 --> 08:38.441

08:38.443 --> 08:41.277
Oh, no, you don't,

08:41.279 --> 08:42.861
First, it's a ride.
Next thing you know,

08:42.864 --> 08:44.747
you're slow dancing,
and my date is dead in my arms.

08:44.749 --> 08:46.248
Shut up, Faye.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.100
What,
you're bringing Jake?

08:48.102 --> 08:49.919
Well, he needs
a date to get in.

08:49.921 --> 08:51.487
Should I have asked
your permission?

08:51.489 --> 08:54.256
They were going
to go together two years ago--

08:54.258 --> 08:56.008
Aah! Shh.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.460
Ancient history.
Leave it at that.

08:57.462 --> 08:58.878
Let's all meet at
the abandoned house,

08:58.880 --> 09:00.012
and we can drive here
together.

09:00.014 --> 09:02.348
Ok. For a bunch
of witches,

09:02.350 --> 09:05.351
the magic of prom
is obviously lost on you.

09:05.353 --> 09:08.837
I mean, if we're going, we might
as well do it right.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.307
A limo? Champagne?

09:11.309 --> 09:13.609
Well, that's what
normal people do

09:13.611 --> 09:15.061
on the big social
event of the year.

09:15.063 --> 09:16.946
And I thought
that we're trying to blend in.

09:16.948 --> 09:17.980
We're not normal.

09:17.982 --> 09:19.632
No, we're
definitely not.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.000
We're not losers,
either.

09:21.002 --> 09:23.569
There will be dancing.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.631
Thank you, daddy.

09:39.703 --> 09:41.637
Hi, Mrs. Chamberlain.

09:46.226 --> 09:48.294
That's one way to keep
an eye on her.

lock and key, if I could.

to build the crystal skull.

fight the witch hunters.

the point.

most powerful weapon.

that you stayed.

I'll get him to confide in me.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.458
Yeah, well,
be careful.

we're vulnerable.

is incredibly insulting.

[Doorbell rings]

12:25.185 --> 12:27.553
I was just about
to call you.

12:27.555 --> 12:30.489
What did you say to Charles
to make him want to stay in town?

12:30.491 --> 12:33.442
Just that it was better
for Diana,

12:33.444 --> 12:35.077
that with
the witch hunters here,

12:35.079 --> 12:39.215
the strength of the circle was her
best protection. Why?

12:39.217 --> 12:45.621
Diana's been suddenly
acting very hostile towards me.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.873
And if I'm going to
assemble the skull, I need her.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.425
Saying that you're her father
doesn't mean

12:49.427 --> 12:51.010
she's automatically
going to see it that way.

12:51.012 --> 12:54.630
You can't force her
to trust you.

12:54.632 --> 12:56.599
If there's one thing you
learned 16 years ago,

12:56.601 --> 13:00.436
it's that you shouldn't take
people's loyalty for granted.

13:00.438 --> 13:03.472
Diana is loyal
to Charles.

13:05.692 --> 13:07.860
Then Charles is
the problem.

13:07.862 --> 13:09.862

What?

they'll know it was you.

13:18.323 --> 13:20.706
Diana will know.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.708
I know that's not
what you want.

13:24.494 --> 13:26.495
I won't lay
a hand on him.

13:28.215 --> 13:31.384
There's other ways
to break their bond.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.336
And I know something
about Charles,

13:33.338 --> 13:36.005
something I can use
to expose him for who he truly is.

Let's see how loyal
Diana is then.

taken off.

14:18.599 --> 14:19.682
What did he say
to you?

14:19.684 --> 14:20.883
Well,
he remembered me,

14:20.885 --> 14:22.184
and he recognized
this place--

14:22.186 --> 14:23.803
and then,
he attacked you.

You scared him.

I saw his eyes.

He looked like
some kind of wild animal.

All he cared
about was the crystal.

he was going to die.

If he hurt you, the Nick we knew
is completely gone.

somewhere.

24:15.024 --> 24:17.758
she wasn't a part
of it anymore.

24:24.983 --> 24:27.084
Look, we have
to follow my mom.

[Music playing]

24:43.635 --> 24:45.803
Hey.

24:45.805 --> 24:47.388
You all right?

24:47.390 --> 24:51.225
You know, none of us
are ever going to have that.

24:53.478 --> 24:55.062
Don't think that way.

24:55.064 --> 24:57.431
Look at us.

24:57.433 --> 25:00.150
Everyone else is
at prom.

25:00.152 --> 25:03.437
Jocks to geeks,
it doesn't matter.

25:03.439 --> 25:05.639
You know,
high school's going to end,

25:05.641 --> 25:07.825
and no one's going
to sign our yearbook

25:07.827 --> 25:10.861
or vote any of us
"most likely to..."

25:10.863 --> 25:12.196
Do anything,

25:12.198 --> 25:16.000
because all we do is
look for crystals

25:16.002 --> 25:19.203
and fight
demonic killers.

25:22.490 --> 25:25.592
I know it's bad
right now.

25:27.062 --> 25:29.296
Things will get
better, I promise.

25:29.298 --> 25:32.266
When?

25:32.268 --> 25:35.686
I thought having magic was
supposed to be...

25:35.688 --> 25:37.771
Magical.

25:42.110 --> 25:44.261
Look at that speaker.

25:48.783 --> 25:51.735
[Chuckles]

25:51.737 --> 25:54.154
Ok, that's
a little better.

25:55.740 --> 25:58.158
Now focus
on the lights.

26:08.336 --> 26:13.140
I ask you,
can jocks and geeks do that?

26:13.142 --> 26:15.309
No.

26:16.728 --> 26:19.630
So,
you want to dance?

26:19.632 --> 26:22.049

Thank you.

Keep playing with that
knife in your pocket,

26:53.466 --> 26:55.248
people might get
the wrong idea.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.250
What?

26:57.252 --> 27:01.588
Being here with you is a lot
more boring than I'd imagined.

27:02.924 --> 27:06.560
We were supposed
to go together two years ago,

27:06.562 --> 27:08.879
and you never
showed up.

27:08.881 --> 27:12.483
I waited
for 3 hours.

27:15.269 --> 27:16.653
You did?

27:16.655 --> 27:19.790
It was my fault

27:19.792 --> 27:21.608
for caring.

27:22.961 --> 27:26.296
I made a habit
of never doing that again.

27:31.636 --> 27:34.254
What are you doing?
Breaking my habit.

27:34.256 --> 27:35.556

Jake.

27:35.558 --> 27:38.675
Jake...

27:41.229 --> 27:43.764
Look...

27:43.766 --> 27:47.351
I usually like
the strong, silent,

27:47.353 --> 27:51.355
totally-messed-up-
under-the-surface types.

27:51.357 --> 27:52.973
But if
you keep this up,

27:52.975 --> 27:54.691
it's not going
to end well.

27:54.693 --> 27:57.411
What are you
talking about?

27:57.413 --> 27:58.979
Nick.

27:58.981 --> 28:03.700
I'm talking about
your feelings for your brother.

28:03.702 --> 28:06.319
I know that's why you've been
so hard on Melissa,

28:06.321 --> 28:08.539
because she's saying everything
that you don't want to think about.

28:08.541 --> 28:10.991
I walked out
on my brother,

28:10.993 --> 28:14.160
and he was taken over
by a demon and died.

28:16.047 --> 28:19.332
Now he's back
as this thing,

28:19.334 --> 28:22.302
and it's my fault.

28:25.339 --> 28:26.690
Listen to me.

28:26.692 --> 28:30.811
Nick was part of the circle
before you were.

28:30.813 --> 28:34.648
We were there
when he died.

28:34.650 --> 28:37.201
We're the ones
that didn't help him, not you.

28:37.203 --> 28:40.988
So you can be
as sad as you want,

28:40.990 --> 28:45.742
but let go of
the self-hatred.

That's Adam's
grandfather.

28:57.006 --> 29:00.057
I came to give
this back, Mr. Conant.

29:01.459 --> 29:03.894
I gave you that to protect
yourself from Blackwell.

29:03.896 --> 29:06.013

Chance Harbor.

I don't need it
anymore.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.068
Ok.
What's going on?

29:11.070 --> 29:13.053
Ethan's been acting
strange all week.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.489
All I know is it's safer for
everyone, including Ethan,

29:15.491 --> 29:17.774
if I just take Cassie
and disappear.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.669
Take a seat.

29:34.876 --> 29:36.426
Now, what aren't
you telling me?

29:38.746 --> 29:40.130
Ethan's
turning John over

29:40.132 --> 29:41.615
to the witch hunters
right now.

29:41.617 --> 29:43.433
There's nothing
I'd rather see

29:43.435 --> 29:45.018
than John Blackwell
out of your lives.

29:45.020 --> 29:47.420
But trusting the witch hunters--
it's reckless.

29:47.422 --> 29:49.923
If the witch hunters can kill
Blackwell, it's worth the risk.

29:49.925 --> 29:52.976
The 6 girls who got pregnant
in my circle--

29:52.978 --> 29:54.561
he made that happen.

29:54.563 --> 29:57.263
He impregnated
all of you?

29:57.265 --> 29:58.598
Only two of us.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.567
He used magic on
the others in the circle

30:00.569 --> 30:02.602
to make sure they conceived with
their boyfriends.

30:02.604 --> 30:06.490
Which means your 6 children will
all grow up together.

a circle for himself

out of Chance Harbor

can never be bound.

your mind.

believe it,

and Cassie's.

30:59.011 --> 31:01.261

who she is.

31:06.217 --> 31:09.136

didn't love her.

31:09.138 --> 31:11.104
He just used her.

31:11.106 --> 31:13.523
He used
all of our parents.

31:13.525 --> 31:16.143
And now,
he's using us.

about my father.

to you.

to the circle.

32:01.368 --> 32:05.353
Blackwell,
he tricked all of us.

32:05.355 --> 32:08.556
The only reason he's in our
lives is because you let him in,

32:08.558 --> 32:11.743
just like your mother
did with her circle.

because of Blackwell.

are dead

see him for what he really is.

32:42.025 --> 32:43.241
That's a good thing,
right?

32:43.243 --> 32:45.410
We also found out

32:45.412 --> 32:48.747
that my father...

32:48.749 --> 32:51.416
made sure that our parents
got pregnant

32:51.418 --> 32:55.337
so that he could come back
and use our circle.

For what?

32:56.957 --> 32:58.790
I don't know.

33:00.075 --> 33:01.626
But until we find out,
we have to make sure

33:01.628 --> 33:03.428
that he doesn't get
that last crystal.

40:01.030 --> 40:03.281
Nick! Nick!

40:03.283 --> 40:05.032
[Coughing]

40:07.119 --> 40:09.120
No!

40:17.129 --> 40:19.096
[Clangs]

40:28.140 --> 40:30.942
He's dead.

40:30.944 --> 40:32.526
You were right.

40:32.528 --> 40:34.695
It wasn't Nick
anymore.

40:39.685 --> 40:42.486
Your father's
fighting Eben.

40:42.488 --> 40:44.655
My father's here?

40:45.741 --> 40:47.541
Where's the crystal?

40:50.162 --> 40:52.330
[Panting]

40:55.667 --> 40:59.003
Eben got away.

41:00.372 --> 41:03.090
Wait. Where's Faye?

41:03.092 --> 41:05.142
He took her.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.482
But we have
the sixth crystal.

41:11.484 --> 41:14.602
We can build
the skull.

41:14.604 --> 41:17.188
We could save her.
