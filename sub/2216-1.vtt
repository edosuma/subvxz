00:32.281 --> 00:33.908
<i>What if I could put him in front of you?</i>

00:34.785 --> 00:36.619
<i>The man that ruined your life?</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:40.623
<i>If I could guarantee
that you'd get away with it</i>

00:41.417 --> 00:42.500
<i>would you kill him?</i>

03:26.290 --> 03:27.331
The Blackmore Cross.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
I understand it's your second.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.792
Congratulations.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.460
You have served honorably.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.882
So that's it?

03:36.425 --> 03:38.551
The order from the board
will come through shortly.

03:38.844 --> 03:39.969
The final order?

03:40.304 --> 03:41.304
Yes.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.763
And the Bomber?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.475
It's not your problem anymore.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.728
I don't need to remind you

03:48.812 --> 03:50.813
of the critical nature
of your final mission.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.649
So please rest.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.072
<i>Every suspect educates us.</i>

04:01.325 --> 04:02.992
<i>Makes us better at what we do.</i>

04:04.119 --> 04:07.163
<i>No more than this elusive sociopath.</i>

04:07.998 --> 04:08.998
<i>He's efficient.</i>

04:09.416 --> 04:11.334
<i>Precise with his timings.</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:14.962
<i>The press have dubbed
him the Fizzle Bomber.</i>

04:16.048 --> 04:17.632
<i>We stopped him this time.</i>

04:18.341 --> 04:20.635
<i>But this was only a small attack.</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:26.015
<i>This is his grand plan.</i>

04:27.184 --> 04:29.769
<i>March 1975.</i>

04:29.853 --> 04:31.437
<i>He keeps changing the day.</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.692
<i>The explosion will level
10 blocks of New York</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:40.029
<i>and leave over 11,000 dead.</i>

04:41.490 --> 04:43.783
<i>Everything we've done
to stop him has failed.</i>

04:44.701 --> 04:46.327
<i>But I was close this time.</i>

04:47.371 --> 04:49.538
Just one more try.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.707
<i>Grafts have taken.</i>

04:52.042 --> 04:54.710
The reconstructive transplant is stable.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.671
But you understand

04:57.130 --> 05:00.049
you will look different
to what you remember.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.510
Eyes will heal.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.805
You should recover
well for this final mission.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.432
And then I'll be decommissioned.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.977
It's not just the physical injuries.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.646
You've logged more field hours

05:13.730 --> 05:16.107
than any of the other agents
I've been assigned to.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.067
The risks are real.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.571
The scars have begun to heal nicely.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.245
Your vocal cord damage has reduced

05:29.830 --> 05:33.124
but will not regrow exactly the same way.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.544
There goes my singing career.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.592
It will take some getting used to.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.148
I've changed so much

05:58.817 --> 06:01.402
that I doubt
my own mother would recognize me.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.041
The order finally came through today.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.168
I guess

06:17.919 --> 06:19.128
it was inevitable.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.299
<i>By the time you listen
to this seven years will have passed.</i>

06:24.718 --> 06:26.093
<i>Our first mission</i>

06:26.178 --> 06:28.679
<i>is just as important as our last.</i>

06:28.972 --> 06:31.974
<i>Each one getting us
closer to our final destination.</i>

06:40.275 --> 06:41.942
Sir, please raise your right hand.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.727
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the rules and regulations

06:45.781 --> 06:48.824
- set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?
- I do.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.118
Do you accept that any diversion
from your mission parameters

06:51.203 --> 06:53.954
will result in immediate court martial?
And if convicted

06:54.122 --> 06:55.539
death by lethal injection.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.665
I do.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.501
Thank you, sir.

06:58.919 --> 06:59.919
Thank you.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.012
<i>Time. It catches up with us all.</i>

07:11.890 --> 07:13.390
<i>Even those in our line of work.</i>

07:16.186 --> 07:18.020
<i>I guess you could say we're gifted.</i>

07:19.606 --> 07:22.525
<i>God, Jesus, it sounds arrogant
saying that out loud.</i>

07:23.693 --> 07:24.777
<i>All right.</i>

07:24.861 --> 07:26.195
<i>I'll put it a better way.</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:28.989
<i>I guess you could say</i>

07:29.866 --> 07:31.659
<i>we were born into this job.</i>

08:26.131 --> 08:27.715
Hey, look at this freak.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.261
There you go, Derek.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.724
What can I get you?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.100
Old Underwear.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.686
Old Underwear. Straight up?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.568
Leave the bottle.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.145
From the look of you
I'm guessing you're not celebrating.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.532
From the look of me?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.201
What do I look like?

08:58.163 --> 09:00.289
Just making conversation. Jesus.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.959
<i>He's down!</i>

09:06.588 --> 09:07.588
Hey, bud, two more.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.340
Chaser, right?

09:16.723 --> 09:17.723
You're new.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.523
Yeah, I've been working
here a couple of weeks.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.269
Yeah? How's it working out?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.979
It's been quiet.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.773
People staying home.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.817
Because of the big, bad Fizzle Bomber?

09:28.902 --> 09:29.902
Yeah, I guess.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.029
Love it.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.156
Like hiding makes you any safer.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.075
Doesn't scare you?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.329
Worrying about every freak show
on the subway won't change things.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.915
That is true.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.792
Haven't seen you around.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.168
You come here often?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.336
What are you, a faggot?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.214
What's your problem?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.548
Hey!

09:52.676 --> 09:54.009
I was joking man. Jesus.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.302
Yeah, well, that's not funny.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.013
Tell me a good one then.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.015
- What, a joke?
- Yeah, come on.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.268
You know, a free shot. Come on.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.352
No, no, I don't know any.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.105
You work in a bar for Chrissakes.
Surely you know a joke.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.607
No, I'm terrible with jokes.
Never remember them.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.692
One joke?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.321
All right, I know one.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.406
But it's not funny.

10:15.991 --> 10:16.991
I'm all ears.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.077
All right, well, a guy
walks into a bar, right?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.305
- Jesus, man.
- Just kidding. No, no, no.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.773
I got a good one. I got a good one.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.126
What comes first, the chicken or the egg?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.420
The rooster.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.839
Oh, shit, see? I'm terrible.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.049
That's the best you got?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.301
- Yeah, well...
- That's not funny.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.510
I told you it wasn't.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.501
You ever think about that, though?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.809
About what?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.519
You know, about what comes first.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.230
What do I care?

10:48.273 --> 10:49.732
- I got more important shit to worry about.
- All right.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.275
Well, you're a big deal, you know.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.943
You got important things to do, right?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.403
What do you do?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.113
Whatever I have to.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.741
Yeah, well it's tough
making a living, that's for sure.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.868
What do you know about tough?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.247
As much as the next guy, I guess.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.876
How about as much as an unmarried mother?

11:11.379 --> 11:12.421
What does that mean?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.760
Four cents a word, I write
confession stories.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.888
"The Unmarried Mother" is my pen name.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.307
Are you serious?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.184
Yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.769
Right. Right!

11:27.187 --> 11:28.270
How's business?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.814
Business is okay. I have a weekly column.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.649
I write them, they print them, I eat.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.569
Right?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.947
- What, you read my work?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.199
Does that surprise you?

11:40.784 --> 11:42.242
- Yeah, a little.
- Why?

11:42.452 --> 11:43.786
You don't fit the demo.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
The demo?

11:45.455 --> 11:48.040
- The demographic.
- Right. Right.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.958
You know, broken women
who want to feel better

11:50.043 --> 11:51.752
about their pitiful lives by reading

11:52.045 --> 11:54.421
hard luck stories of
heartbreak and betrayal

11:54.506 --> 11:55.964
spewed across the glossy pages

11:56.049 --> 11:57.758
of 25 cent pulp sludge.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.302
Yeah, exactly.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.985
Yeah, well you're being a little hard
on yourself, don't you think?

12:03.014 --> 12:04.014
It's garbage.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.534
I thought I had some talent
telling stories but who am I kidding?

12:07.936 --> 12:09.456
I mean, you tell me. You've read them.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.022
I have to admit I've had a few

12:12.399 --> 12:15.067
dark nights
when I've looked to you for a little

12:15.235 --> 12:16.985
insight into the feminine mind.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.875
You know, it seems to me
you've got a real hit on the woman's angle.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.990
- Woman's angle?
- Yeah.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.827
Yeah, I know the woman's angle.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.745
I should.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.873
Why, you married? You got sisters?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.478
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.461
The one thing that this job has taught me

12:34.546 --> 12:36.547
is that truth is stranger than fiction.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.549
I have heard some incredible shit.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.259
Nothing astonishes me anymore.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.865
You don't know what incredible means.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.178
Yeah? Well, try me.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.059
Here you go. I got that.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.550
Forget it, man. I'm not telling you.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.029
You're scared it's not good enough.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.406
- You think that'll work?
- Yeah.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.490
What are we, 12?

13:04.701 --> 13:05.701
Come on.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.760
Bet you the rest of that bottle
I got the best story you ever heard.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.335
Bet you a full bottle.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.845
What do you say?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.516
If I lose?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.268
Just add a 20 to the tip.

13:33.980 --> 13:34.980
Why not?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.317
Hey, man.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.111
- Two Buds, bud.
- Right.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.030
<i>Mayor Davidson,
how do you respond to the fact</i>

13:43.114 --> 13:44.990
<i>that many New Yorkers are leaving the city</i>

13:45.074 --> 13:47.784
<i>in fear of a fifth attack
by the Fizzle Bomber?</i>

13:47.869 --> 13:49.411
<i>We've got extra police patrols</i>

13:49.496 --> 13:51.455
<i>on 24 hour shifts around the city.</i>

13:51.915 --> 13:55.375
<i>We've created a joint task force
with the Federal Bomb Squad</i>

13:55.585 --> 13:58.921
<i>and the FBI in order
to track down the suspect.</i>

13:59.464 --> 14:00.923
What a stupid name.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.049
"Fizzle Bomber."

14:02.425 --> 14:04.760
The guy makes compressed
RDX-based explosive compounds.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.053
That's not easy.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.013
"Fizzle Bomber" is easier to remember.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.348
I hate that name.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.391
Makes it sound like his bombs just fizzle.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.876
Like they don't do any real damage.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.645
I don't think anybody's doubting

14:15.104 --> 14:16.897
how dangerous this asshole is.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.026
Well, there's a lot of selfish assholes
out there needing a good shake up.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.194
They should be afraid.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.783
Well, he's killed 112 people already.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.618
Some people just gotta go.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.287
Stops the gene pool right in its tracks.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.539
Yeah.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.290
Maybe he's doing the city a favor.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.588
Better be careful who hears you say that.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.131
What, you think I'm wrong?

14:43.466 --> 14:45.706
I'm just saying
that kind of talk can get you in trouble.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.820
No worse than I've already been through.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.057
Now listen, you keep promising
the best story of my life.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.268
But I'm not hearing anything.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.360
All right.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.764
Guess I'll start at the beginning.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.994
When I was a little girl...

15:12.912 --> 15:13.912
What?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.273
What, you want me to tell my story?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.500
No, I just, I thought...

15:20.003 --> 15:21.837
I'm sorry. Yeah, sure. Go on, go on.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.719
When I was a little girl...

15:35.351 --> 15:36.831
You ever hear of Christine Jorgensen?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.228
Roberta Cowell?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.105
Yeah, yeah, they had

15:40.273 --> 15:42.107
sex change.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.359
So you...

15:44.444 --> 15:45.444
Don't interrupt.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.452
It was September 13th, 1945.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.623
<i>I was a foundling.</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:00.500
<i>A newborn left on an orphanage doorstep.</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:10.719
City of Cleveland Orphanage.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.395
That's a good girl.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.608
Well, there's no signs
of trauma or exposure.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.193
The child appears healthy.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.781
If she shows any signs
of infection or excessive coughing,

16:30.907 --> 16:33.158
she should be taken
to the hospital for a thorough examination.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.242
Yes, Doctor.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.620
She got a name?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.122
Jane.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.166
Jane will have to do for now.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.669
I'll be back to check on Jane in a week.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.087
I look forward to it.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.219
Don't worry, sweetheart.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.304
We'll take good care of you now.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.603
<i>I was just one
of a dozen babies who had no past.</i>

17:04.107 --> 17:05.607
<i>But that was all we had in common.</i>

17:07.944 --> 17:10.112
<i>I was never sick, not one day.</i>

17:10.195 --> 17:11.821
<i>So I was never taken to a hospital.</i>

17:12.615 --> 17:14.156
<i>Not until later in my life.</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:31.675
Slow down.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.827
One chocolate ice cream

17:58.911 --> 18:00.787
- for the cute little lady.
- Thank you.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.549
<i>When I was little, I
envied kids with parents.</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:17.179
<i>I always wondered what it would be like.</i>

18:22.518 --> 18:23.643
Stupid kid!

18:23.728 --> 18:24.895
Get off the damn street!

18:29.817 --> 18:31.151
Little shit!

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
Jane!

18:33.404 --> 18:34.446
Come here now.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.159
Son of a bitch!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.747
<i>I never understood
why my parents abandoned me.</i>

18:44.499 --> 18:46.041
<i>What had I done that was so wrong?</i>

18:47.001 --> 18:49.878
<i>But as I got older,
I knew something was different about me.</i>

19:09.190 --> 19:10.774
<i>Sex confused me, you know?</i>

19:11.108 --> 19:13.235
<i>The way it works, the way everything fits.</i>

19:14.737 --> 19:16.363
<i>I felt different.</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:18.990
<i>And even back then,
I knew that I was going to be different</i>

19:19.075 --> 19:20.200
<i>from all the other girls.</i>

19:22.119 --> 19:23.912
I made a solemn vow

19:24.080 --> 19:26.873
that any kid of mine
would have both a mom and a pop.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.834
A real family.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.044
It kept me pure.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.921
Away from temptation.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.843
So I focused my attention
on more important things.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.303
Like learning how to fight.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
Fight! Fight!

19:49.605 --> 19:51.147
- Come on, Lucy, go!
- Come on!

19:51.232 --> 19:52.274
What'd you call me?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.901
Pinky, four-eyed, little bitch...

19:54.986 --> 19:55.986
<i>I was tough.</i>

19:56.737 --> 19:58.613
<i>Much stronger than any of the other kids.</i>

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
<i>Even the boys.</i>

20:02.118 --> 20:03.660
All right, break it up!

20:03.995 --> 20:06.288
- Jane, come with me!
- Let go!

20:06.414 --> 20:08.294
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't do anything!

20:12.837 --> 20:14.129
<i>And I was smart too.</i>

20:14.922 --> 20:15.964
<i>Top of the class.</i>

20:16.924 --> 20:18.049
Equals...

20:20.678 --> 20:21.678
Jane!

20:22.013 --> 20:23.013
Jane.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.181
How do you ever expect
to learn anything if you never...

20:25.266 --> 20:26.266
Fifteen.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.894
<i>Math and physics were my favorite subjects.</i>

20:28.978 --> 20:30.770
- That's correct.
<i>- It all came easy for me.</i>

20:31.105 --> 20:32.105
Retard.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.358
Enough!

20:47.121 --> 20:48.121
<i>When I got older,</i>

20:48.164 --> 20:50.665
<i>I realized I stood
little chance of getting married</i>

20:51.042 --> 20:53.001
<i>for the same reason I hadn't been adopted.</i>

20:55.379 --> 20:56.421
<i>I was different.</i>

20:57.214 --> 20:59.174
<i>A freak. A goddamn loser.</i>

21:00.927 --> 21:02.344
<i>I stopped looking in the mirror.</i>

21:03.179 --> 21:04.429
<i>I hated what I saw.</i>

21:08.017 --> 21:10.477
<i>I have no photos of myself as a young girl.</i>

21:11.228 --> 21:12.868
I don't even remember what I looked like.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.482
It's just more of a feeling now.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.442
Well, you look better than I do.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.361
Who cares how a barkeep looks?

21:21.906 --> 21:23.239
Or a writer for that matter.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.867
But you know how it is.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.370
People want to adopt
a little golden-haired moron.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.121
And later on, the boys,

21:30.206 --> 21:32.248
they want big tits and pouty lips.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.376
<i>You know, perfect accessory.</i>

21:35.044 --> 21:36.044
<i>I couldn't compete.</i>

21:36.212 --> 21:37.212
Jane,

21:37.254 --> 21:39.798
Mr. Robertson has made a special effort

21:39.924 --> 21:42.217
to talk to some of our
graduating girls today.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.136
You will do him the courtesy
of listening to what he has to say.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.265
Jane, I work for a new organization

21:49.392 --> 21:51.309
seeking young women, like yourself,

21:51.394 --> 21:53.937
to train in a career in government service.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.231
We are what you might call

21:57.274 --> 21:58.274
progressive.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.735
I hear you're interested in space travel.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.406
Well, they say that girls
can't be astronauts.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.077
That's true.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.414
We're seeking young ladies
who show great promise

22:12.540 --> 22:14.708
in the fields of mathematics and science,

22:15.251 --> 22:17.502
as well as strong physical abilities.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.261
I hear you're a bit of a backyard brawler.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.547
<i>This was around the time the suits</i>

22:36.564 --> 22:40.108
<i>finally admitted you can't send
men into space for months or years</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:42.235
<i>and not do something to
relieve the tension.</i>

22:44.822 --> 22:46.489
<i>They were looking for respectable types,</i>

22:46.699 --> 22:47.824
<i>preferably virgins.</i>

22:48.284 --> 22:49.951
<i>They liked to train them from scratch.</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:53.580
<i>Above average mentally
and stable emotionally.</i>

22:55.041 --> 22:57.000
<i>But most of the volunteers were hookers</i>

22:57.084 --> 23:00.086
<i>or neurotics
who would crack up 10 days off Earth.</i>

23:01.047 --> 23:02.213
<i>They weren't special.</i>

23:06.010 --> 23:07.385
<i>Just relax, Jane.</i>

23:07.845 --> 23:10.221
Some of the ladies
before you got a little nervous

23:10.306 --> 23:12.015
a little lost in thought.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.102
Perhaps that's because
to them a thought is unfamiliar territory.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.460
Do you see this as some kind of joke?

23:21.817 --> 23:22.817
No, sir.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.112
We've had some
of these Women's Lib types in here

23:26.197 --> 23:27.489
causing a big fuss.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.407
But that's not you, is it Jane?

23:29.492 --> 23:31.076
No, sir.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.827
Please take your glasses off.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.005
I see you've had
some disciplinary problems in the past.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.342
I've had nothing but straight As
in all my classes since the first grade.

23:47.510 --> 23:48.510
Yes.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.136
Have you ever been with a man?

23:51.305 --> 23:52.305
Have you?

23:56.268 --> 23:59.521
You understand what
this employment will require of you?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.899
Will I get to travel into space?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.984
If selected, yes.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.445
No,

24:08.030 --> 24:09.531
I haven't been with a man.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.285
How do you see your role on this journey?

24:14.537 --> 24:15.537
My role?

24:15.996 --> 24:19.624
Well, many of the girls we've interviewed
see this as a paid vacation.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.794
A chance to live the good life
and meet the man of their dreams.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.963
Do you see yourself as a tourist

24:25.422 --> 24:26.881
or a participant?

24:27.925 --> 24:31.219
I've excelled
in advanced physics, biology and astronomy.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.054
A tourist is someone who

24:33.139 --> 24:36.516
travels across the ocean only to be
photographed sitting next to their boat.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.704
I have no intention of being a tourist.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.482
If they accepted me
they'd teach me how to walk and dance

24:44.567 --> 24:45.567
and, you know,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.569
how to listen to a man pleasingly.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.197
Plus training for the prime duties.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.408
Nothing's too good for our boys, right?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.411
They made sure that you didn't get pregnant
during your enlistment.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.818
You were almost certain
to marry at the end of your hitch.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.499
Same way today's
Flight Angels marry Spacers.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.444
Well, they talk the same language.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.086
Right.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.182
<i>They gave me contact lenses.</i>

25:20.144 --> 25:22.312
<i>I'd never seen the world so clearly before.</i>

26:01.477 --> 26:02.602
<i>They tested our endurance.</i>

26:03.604 --> 26:05.688
<i>Made sure we were fit for space travel.</i>

26:15.366 --> 26:17.075
<i>Many of the girls struggled.</i>

26:18.369 --> 26:19.369
<i>Not me.</i>

26:28.462 --> 26:30.338
How often do you think about sex?

26:30.673 --> 26:33.258
A, not at all. B, rarely.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.802
C, sometimes. D, often.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.637
E, all the time?

26:41.517 --> 26:42.684
C, sometimes.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.442
D, often.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.280
<i>The testing went on for months.</i>

26:55.698 --> 26:56.864
<i>They tested us on everything.</i>

27:05.833 --> 27:07.292
<i>Many girls failed.</i>

27:09.253 --> 27:10.253
<i>Not me.</i>

27:13.632 --> 27:15.550
Highest numbers we've ever seen.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.302
<i>Do you ever feel depressed?</i>

27:17.970 --> 27:19.429
- What do you mean?
- Sad.

27:19.722 --> 27:20.722
Empty at times.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.641
Sometimes...

27:25.269 --> 27:27.395
I guess I feel
like there's something out of balance.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.580
Like I'm living in somebody else's body.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.137
I don't know how to describe it.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.569
And none of the girls here like me.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.823
You'll just need to give it some time.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.950
They'll come round.

27:45.748 --> 27:46.748
Get her back!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.334
- Come on!
- Go, Marcy!

27:56.425 --> 27:57.425
Come on!

27:58.302 --> 27:59.302
Come on, Marcy!

27:59.553 --> 28:01.137
- Throw her down!
- Hit her back!

28:03.098 --> 28:04.474
- Hey!
- Hey get off her!

28:06.894 --> 28:08.728
- Get off!
- Stop!

28:24.661 --> 28:28.247
We have performed a more detailed
physical examination of the patient.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.301
I see.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.137
You do know that this will disqualify her.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.476
You've not told the recruit?

28:49.144 --> 28:50.895
- No.
- Don't.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.563
I'll take care of it.

29:01.907 --> 29:02.907
I don't get it.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.777
I was just defending myself.
What was I supposed to do?

29:06.328 --> 29:07.328
I know.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.251
Believe me, it's not over yet.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.866
I'll go to the Board of Appeals.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.755
I'll do everything to get you reenlisted.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
I promise.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.716
Trust me, Jane.

29:21.552 --> 29:22.552
<i>And that was it.</i>

29:22.678 --> 29:24.679
<i>Because of a stupid fight I was done.</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:28.141
<i>I had to support myself.</i>

29:28.517 --> 29:31.018
<i>I couldn't rely on Mr. Robertson's promise
to see me through.</i>

29:31.353 --> 29:34.397
<i>- You're a witch?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.</i>

29:34.857 --> 29:36.816
<i>To earn money I worked
as a mother's helper.</i>

29:38.944 --> 29:41.404
<i>This family simply wanted a cheap servant.</i>

29:46.827 --> 29:49.537
<i>That was when
I first discovered confession stories.</i>

29:50.956 --> 29:52.556
<i>I didn't care if they were real or fake.</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:54.208
<i>It was a great way to pass the time.</i>

29:57.212 --> 29:58.754
<i>I did housework during the day</i>

30:00.132 --> 30:01.466
<i>and went to school at night.</i>

30:02.217 --> 30:04.260
<i>When eating in formal situations,</i>

30:04.595 --> 30:06.345
rest your knife and your fork on the plate

30:06.430 --> 30:07.889
between mouthfuls or to talk.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.099
<i>Charm class was a way
of proving to the Appeals Board</i>

30:10.184 --> 30:12.560
<i>that I was working on my decorum.</i>

30:16.398 --> 30:18.024
If you're finished with your meal...

30:18.233 --> 30:20.359
<i>It was the first time
I wasn't good at something.</i>

30:22.738 --> 30:24.572
And when I wasn't expecting it,

30:25.657 --> 30:26.741
I met him.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.306
I'm so sorry.

30:51.767 --> 30:52.767
There he was.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.936
Are you lost?

30:55.771 --> 30:57.563
He told me he was waiting for someone.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.317
Well, you know what they say about
good things happening to those who wait.

31:01.777 --> 31:05.404
"But only the things
left behind by those who hustle", he said.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.615
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

31:08.408 --> 31:10.618
<i>It was a quote by Abraham Lincoln</i>

31:10.869 --> 31:13.663
<i>- and I was thinking the exact same thing.</i>
- I was thinking the exact same thing.

31:13.747 --> 31:14.789
What are the odds?

31:15.791 --> 31:18.626
He was handsome, rich.

31:19.086 --> 31:22.380
He treated me with a kindness
that I'd never experienced before.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.967
You know, he actually had wads
of $100 bills in his pocket.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.148
More money than I'd seen in my whole life.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.875
He told me he'd take care of me.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.014
All show, right?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.687
- Do you shoot pool?
- Yeah.

31:38.772 --> 31:42.108
<i>With the Fizzle Bomber
attacks becoming larger and larger,</i>

31:42.192 --> 31:45.653
<i>many New Yorkers fear
a bombing of mass scale is inevitable.</i>

31:45.737 --> 31:49.824
<i>Over 10,000 have already evacuated
upstate into surrounding counties...</i>

31:50.409 --> 31:51.409
He was different.

31:51.868 --> 31:52.868
I liked him.

31:53.537 --> 31:56.414
He was the first man
who was nice to me without playing games.

31:56.665 --> 31:57.832
I was young and in love.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.792
Famous last words.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.007
Haven't you ever done
something stupid for love?

32:02.629 --> 32:03.671
Once.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.298
So you understand.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.465
I do.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.721
<i>I never thought it would happen.</i>

32:12.097 --> 32:13.639
<i>Falling for someone.</i>

32:14.224 --> 32:17.643
<i>All my little rules
about being pure went out the window.</i>

32:18.061 --> 32:20.730
It was the happiest time
of my life but it didn't last long.

32:23.984 --> 32:24.984
<i>One night,</i>

32:25.110 --> 32:26.152
<i>he sat me down.</i>

32:26.486 --> 32:27.737
<i>Told me to wait for a moment.</i>

32:27.821 --> 32:29.071
Where are you going?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.116
<i>He told me he'd be right back.</i>

32:33.952 --> 32:34.952
And then?

32:35.871 --> 32:36.954
And then nothing.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.748
I never saw him again.

32:39.833 --> 32:40.916
<i>He never came back.</i>

32:41.543 --> 32:42.960
<i>Well, maybe he had a good reason.</i>

32:43.295 --> 32:44.295
Okay.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.379
<i>I didn't deserve it.</i>

32:45.756 --> 32:48.716
Somehow I'd managed to convince myself
that it had been all for the best.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.972
I hadn't really loved him.
It was just a fling.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.138
I was more eager than ever
to rejoin Space Corp.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.183
I'd been let down in my life so many times

32:57.267 --> 32:58.987
why should I have gotten
my hopes up, right?

33:00.604 --> 33:01.729
<i>Then sometimes</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:05.149
<i>people surprise you.</i>

33:06.443 --> 33:08.736
I hadn't been entirely
truthful with you, Jane.

33:08.904 --> 33:09.904
About what, sir?

33:10.906 --> 33:13.115
In order to protect our nation's citizens,

33:13.742 --> 33:15.409
it's important we keep

33:15.494 --> 33:18.079
certain government operations confidential.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.413
Wouldn't you agree?

33:19.956 --> 33:20.956
Yes, sir.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.251
I work for an organization
whose primary purpose

33:24.336 --> 33:26.337
is not space travel.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.466
It's reshaping wrongdoings.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.010
We use Space Corp, among others,

33:33.095 --> 33:35.596
as a means
of finding people who are special.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.516
They are what
you might call a recruitment agency.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.018
I don't understand.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.187
A recruitment agency for what?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.944
For people with exceptional abilities.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.821
People like yourself.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.364
People without families.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.533
Without husbands and wives and children.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.951
No past.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.786
No ties to the future.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.164
You see, the work we do is complicated

34:02.749 --> 34:05.126
and it requires employees with

34:05.460 --> 34:07.920
advanced motor skills, remarkable memories.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.589
It's a job for the best and the brightest.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.299
For the elite.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.344
The elite?

34:16.929 --> 34:17.972
I couldn't believe it.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.056
Seemed like I had
a bright future ahead of me.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.560
I didn't really understand
what the job meant.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.978
They were very covert and secretive but

34:26.022 --> 34:27.862
I knew it would change
my life for the better.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.735
And they didn't insist on virgins.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.902
They were different to Space Corp.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.824
It wasn't until my skirts got tight
that I realized my future was over.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.203
You were pregnant?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.706
Yeah, wouldn't you know it?

34:44.583 --> 34:47.168
My mystery man had left me
with more than just a broken heart.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.422
So that bright future,
that girl who was elite?

34:51.505 --> 34:52.505
She was gone.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.884
And I never saw Mr. Robertson again.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.764
<i>With nowhere to go I
landed in a charity ward</i>

34:59.848 --> 35:02.683
<i>surrounded by other big bellies
and trotted bedpans</i>

35:02.768 --> 35:04.018
<i>until my time came.</i>

35:05.604 --> 35:07.021
<i>I never felt so alone.</i>

35:13.445 --> 35:16.489
<i>One night I found myself on an
operating table with a nurse saying...</i>

35:16.698 --> 35:17.865
Relax, Jane. Relax.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.074
Now breathe deeply.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.800
How do you feel?

35:36.343 --> 35:37.968
Tired.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.221
That's natural.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.099
A cesarean can be difficult.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.893
You pulled through fine.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.604
A cesarean? Doctor, is my baby okay?

35:48.772 --> 35:49.939
Your baby's fine.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.233
Is it a boy or a girl?

35:52.734 --> 35:54.026
It's a healthy little girl.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.861
Seven pounds three ounces.

35:57.823 --> 35:58.906
<i>You know it's something...</i>

35:59.074 --> 36:00.282
...to have made a baby.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.452
I remember thinking I would tack
on the admission form "Mrs."

36:04.079 --> 36:05.788
Let her think her papa was dead.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.249
No orphanage for my kid.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.236
<i>But then the surgeon kept talking.</i>

36:13.547 --> 36:14.755
What is it, Doctor?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.175
Have you ever had
a thorough examination before?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.011
Yes.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.763
What'd the doctors tell you?

36:24.349 --> 36:25.432
Nothing.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.717
I thought everything was fine.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.728
So no doctor's ever told you that

36:30.856 --> 36:32.106
your internal set up

36:32.190 --> 36:34.316
was different than most?

36:35.861 --> 36:36.861
No.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.070
What are you talking about?

36:41.783 --> 36:42.783
Why?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.372
Did you ever hear
about that Scottish physician?

36:48.498 --> 36:50.666
She lived as a female till she was 35,

36:50.876 --> 36:54.336
and then she had surgery
and became legally and medically a man?

36:56.006 --> 36:57.631
She got married. Everything was okay.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.887
What's that got to do with me?

37:07.851 --> 37:11.270
When we performed your operation
we found something very unique.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.813
One of a kind, actually.

37:13.273 --> 37:16.650
After I successfully removed your baby
I called for the Chief of Surgery.

37:16.776 --> 37:20.154
We held consultation
and we worked for hours

37:20.697 --> 37:22.489
to reconstruct you the best we could.

37:24.034 --> 37:25.034
Reconstruct?

37:25.368 --> 37:28.412
You had two full sets of organs, Jane.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.165
Female and male.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.375
Both immature

37:33.877 --> 37:35.127
but the female set

37:35.211 --> 37:37.755
well enough developed
for you to have a baby.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.008
But I'm afraid, my dear,

37:42.010 --> 37:45.012
the excessive bleeding from the birth

37:45.180 --> 37:47.765
forced us to perform a hysterectomy.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.392
We had to remove your ovaries and uterus.

37:54.773 --> 37:55.856
What are you saying?

37:56.983 --> 37:58.859
But the reconstruction

37:59.194 --> 38:02.571
allowed us to create a male urinary tract.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.074
Further surgeries will be required.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.453
To become a man?

38:12.958 --> 38:14.375
Is this some kind of joke?

38:15.502 --> 38:16.877
I'm afraid it's not.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.213
You're young.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.799
Your bones will readjust.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.884
We'll watch your hormonal balance.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.594
It's not a death sentence.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.388
Your life can continue.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.024
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.945
Have you thought of a name yet?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.240
Well, I was thinking of Jane,

38:47.242 --> 38:48.534
after her mother.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.079
<i>I guess it was a way
of keeping the name in the family.</i>

38:52.831 --> 38:55.416
<i>After all, I knew eventually
I would have to change mine.</i>

38:55.959 --> 38:57.376
That's a good name.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.421
<i>My feelings changed to cold determination.</i>

39:01.256 --> 39:03.257
<i>I had to do right by my baby Jane.</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:06.385
But two weeks later
that didn't mean anything.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.512
Why?

39:10.098 --> 39:11.223
She was snatched.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.267
- Snatched?
- Yeah.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.596
What do you mean "snatched"?

39:14.978 --> 39:16.020
Kidnapped.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.938
Stolen from the goddamn hospital nursery.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.630
I mean how's that for taking
the last a man's got to live for?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.613
<i>When the nurse
had her back turned, someone walked in</i>

39:26.698 --> 39:28.073
<i>and walked out with her.</i>

39:29.451 --> 39:30.492
<i>Were there any clues?</i>

39:30.994 --> 39:32.578
<i>Any description?</i>

39:33.163 --> 39:34.288
Just a man.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.540
<i>With a face-shaped face.</i>

39:37.459 --> 39:38.751
<i>Like yours or mine.</i>

39:44.257 --> 39:46.133
No! No!

39:48.470 --> 39:49.830
Could have been the baby's father.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.182
The nurse swore it was an older man
but who else would swipe my baby?

39:53.892 --> 39:55.017
What'd you do?

39:55.727 --> 39:57.311
Filed a missing person's report.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.148
Checked adoption agencies,
orphanages. You name it, I did it.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.192
But nothing.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.985
It's like she vanished.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.154
And they never found the guy?

40:10.033 --> 40:11.158
Never.

40:12.786 --> 40:16.163
But then my other little problem
began to take center stage.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.252
Jane, I want you to count
backwards from 10 for me.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.799
Ten, nine, eight,

40:27.050 --> 40:30.803
seven, six, five, four...

40:34.182 --> 40:36.058
<i>I spent 11 months in that fucked-up place</i>

40:36.518 --> 40:39.186
<i>and had three major operations.</i>

40:41.231 --> 40:43.190
I started taking testosterone,

40:43.942 --> 40:46.026
which deepened my voice a little bit

40:46.111 --> 40:48.153
<i>but not enough.</i>

40:48.488 --> 40:51.573
<i>So I started practicing talking like a man.</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:52.699
Hi.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.076
Hi.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.202
Hi.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.370
Hey.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.704
Hi, nice to meet you.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.248
Hi, nice to meet you.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.125
Nice to meet you. It's a lovely day.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.377
Hi, nice to meet you.

41:05.547 --> 41:06.755
It's a lovely day.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.884
I never could get it right, though.

41:13.596 --> 41:14.596
<i>Hi.</i>

41:15.890 --> 41:17.474
My name is Jane.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.354
<i>My name is Jane.</i>

41:27.694 --> 41:29.444
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.363
My name is Jane.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.741
My name is...

41:53.469 --> 41:56.889
<i>I was always afraid to look in the mirror
and see the person looking back at me.</i>

41:57.557 --> 41:59.433
<i>I held off as long as I could.</i>

42:04.147 --> 42:06.398
<i>Now, it didn't matter anymore.</i>

42:11.404 --> 42:13.614
<i>The person I knew was truly gone.</i>

42:44.938 --> 42:45.938
<i>Strange.</i>

42:47.815 --> 42:49.691
Every time I looked at my new appearance

42:49.776 --> 42:52.152
I was reminded
of that bastard that ruined my life.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.241
That's some messed up irony I guess.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.578
The funny thing was

43:02.497 --> 43:03.705
the nurses,

43:05.333 --> 43:06.833
they thought I was quite handsome.

43:07.752 --> 43:08.752
Yeah,

43:08.962 --> 43:10.337
a fucking catch.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.381
Right, right, right.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.343
I guess I also knew
what women wanted to hear.

43:16.469 --> 43:17.844
Compliments, right?

43:19.430 --> 43:20.430
Right.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.433
Well,

43:24.686 --> 43:26.687
it seems to me you came out okay.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.358
Came out okay?

43:31.442 --> 43:32.859
Well, you know, I just mean

43:33.486 --> 43:35.237
you just seem like a,

43:35.613 --> 43:37.572
you know, a normal man.

43:39.325 --> 43:40.325
Yeah.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.161
More normal than ever now.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.580
How so? What's that mean?

43:46.082 --> 43:48.375
Well, I just found out this morning that

43:48.459 --> 43:50.377
I'm not shooting blanks anymore.

43:51.713 --> 43:53.547
Well, all right.

43:53.881 --> 43:57.884
Doctor's prognosis,
I'm a fully fertile male specimen.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.512
Well, let me be the first
to congratulate you.

44:01.431 --> 44:02.556
Welcome to the tribe.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.565
You know, sometimes

44:13.359 --> 44:16.778
I think this world deserves
the shit storm that it gets.

44:18.406 --> 44:19.406
I know.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.367
I mean, let's face it. Nobody's innocent.

44:23.870 --> 44:27.331
Everybody just uses everybody else
to get what they want.

44:28.750 --> 44:29.916
Maybe.

44:30.752 --> 44:31.793
Maybe not.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.302
You ever hear the expression
"a ruined woman"?

44:40.428 --> 44:41.470
Of course.

44:42.263 --> 44:45.432
Well, I was as ruined as a woman could be.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.810
I was no longer a woman

44:48.936 --> 44:51.605
and I did not know how to be a man.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.274
Well, it does take some getting used to.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.610
You have no idea.

44:57.445 --> 45:00.655
I don't mean learning how to dress or talk.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.576
Or not walking into the wrong bathroom.

45:07.622 --> 45:08.914
You know, how could I live?

45:09.791 --> 45:11.333
What job could I get?

45:12.085 --> 45:13.335
I didn't know a trade.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.128
Couldn't drive a car.

45:16.798 --> 45:19.841
I hate that bastard for
ripping out my heart

45:19.926 --> 45:21.468
and ruining my life.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.096
He deserves to die.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.684
<i>So I thought I'd reenlist in Space Corp.</i>

45:30.728 --> 45:32.646
<i>This time to become an astronaut.</i>

45:34.982 --> 45:36.650
<i>It was ridiculous, I know.</i>

45:37.026 --> 45:38.860
<i>They had my records. I couldn't lie.</i>

45:41.989 --> 45:44.908
<i>One look at me
and I was marked unfit for basic training.</i>

45:46.119 --> 45:48.745
<i>I think the doctor spent time
on me just from curiosity.</i>

45:50.498 --> 45:51.873
<i>He'd read about my case.</i>

45:53.751 --> 45:55.335
I was desperate.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.033
I was looking for a way back in.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.341
You know, I've been called
a freak my whole life.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.802
Now I really was.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.597
Just a lab rat to be experimented on.

46:07.682 --> 46:08.682
I'm so sorry.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.809
- Yeah, right.
- I am.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.524
I've had a lot of people tell me
how sorry they are for what happened to me.

46:19.235 --> 46:20.610
I don't want to hear it anymore.

46:20.695 --> 46:21.736
Then what do you want?

46:24.574 --> 46:25.782
What does anyone want?

46:26.367 --> 46:27.367
Love.

46:28.244 --> 46:29.870
Fuck love.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.330
A purpose.

46:32.707 --> 46:33.874
A purpose?

46:34.876 --> 46:36.376
You don't have that?

46:37.086 --> 46:38.587
I'm working on it.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.839
Why can't love be a purpose?

46:41.841 --> 46:42.883
Hippy bullshit.

46:43.426 --> 46:45.177
It's easier to hate than to love, right?

46:47.221 --> 46:48.221
Yeah.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.931
It's easier to destroy something.

46:50.016 --> 46:51.099
Kill somebody.

46:51.476 --> 46:52.726
You think you could do that?

46:54.270 --> 46:55.312
Maybe.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.067
I see it in your eyes, too.

47:02.403 --> 47:03.403
That bitterness.

47:04.739 --> 47:05.864
It can take over.

47:06.991 --> 47:08.200
It can.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.998
Well, you know if you don't move forward

47:15.082 --> 47:17.626
you fall backwards into a river of shit.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.880
So

47:23.591 --> 47:27.469
anyway, rather than getting angry
and pissing away my entire future

47:29.055 --> 47:31.097
I knew I just had to get on with my life.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.357
<i>So</i>

47:41.484 --> 47:42.776
<i>I changed my name</i>

47:42.860 --> 47:43.944
<i>and came to New York.</i>

47:53.955 --> 47:55.539
<i>I got by as a fry cook</i>

47:55.873 --> 47:58.208
<i>but the hours were long
and the money was horseshit.</i>

48:01.045 --> 48:04.839
<i>So I bought a typewriter
and set myself up as a public stenographer.</i>

48:06.884 --> 48:07.884
<i>What a laugh.</i>

48:09.762 --> 48:12.806
<i>In four months I typed six letters
and one manuscript.</i>

48:13.558 --> 48:17.060
<i>The manuscript was for</i> Real Life Tales
<i>and a total waste of paper.</i>

48:17.144 --> 48:18.895
<i>But the jerk who wrote it, sold it.</i>

48:19.063 --> 48:20.188
<i>Which gave me an idea.</i>

48:23.943 --> 48:26.945
<i>I bought a stack of confession magazines
and studied them.</i>

48:35.830 --> 48:37.080
<i>The words came easy.</i>

48:39.000 --> 48:41.167
<i>The Unmarried Mother was born.</i>

48:43.879 --> 48:46.256
<i>So, now you know how I get
the authentic woman's angle</i>

48:46.841 --> 48:48.633
on an Unmarried Mother story.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.344
Through the only version I haven't sold.

48:52.054 --> 48:53.054
The true one.

48:54.807 --> 48:57.183
So, do I win the bottle?

49:00.229 --> 49:01.229
Not bad.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.190
Not bad.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.945
So, is that it? Story's over?

49:09.322 --> 49:11.114
Yeah, afraid so.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.160
The man that ruined my life is a ghost
and so is my daughter.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.954
I guess at some point you just
gotta let things go.

49:18.039 --> 49:19.039
And have you?

49:19.332 --> 49:20.332
Fuck no.

49:24.587 --> 49:26.254
What if I could put him in front of you?

49:27.715 --> 49:29.215
The man that ruined your life.

49:30.176 --> 49:32.302
And if I could guarantee you

49:32.637 --> 49:33.887
that you'd get away with it.

49:36.182 --> 49:37.223
Would you kill him?

49:39.810 --> 49:40.852
In a heartbeat.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.022
I know where he is.

49:45.775 --> 49:46.941
Yeah, of course you do.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.026
No bullshit.

49:48.361 --> 49:50.028
And how the hell do you know that?

49:53.366 --> 49:54.366
There are records.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.869
Hospital records, orphanage records,
medical records...

49:57.953 --> 49:58.995
Been there, done that.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.289
Beth Fetherage.

50:02.249 --> 50:04.449
Wasn't that the name of your caretaker
at the orphanage?

50:04.919 --> 50:05.919
Beth?

50:07.672 --> 50:08.755
You son of a bitch.

50:08.923 --> 50:10.006
Have you been following me?

50:10.091 --> 50:11.591
Son of a bitch. That's funny.

50:12.593 --> 50:13.593
No.

50:13.678 --> 50:16.262
Your name, as a woman, was Jane, right?

50:16.389 --> 50:18.723
You told me that. You didn't tell me
your name as a man.

50:18.808 --> 50:21.726
John. Which is not terribly original,
by the way.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.172
What are you, a cop or something?

50:23.229 --> 50:25.188
I can put this guy in your lap.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.191
You can do whatever you want

50:28.859 --> 50:31.945
and I guarantee you
you'll get away with it.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.201
All right, where is he?

50:41.789 --> 50:43.164
I do something for you

50:43.833 --> 50:45.125
and you do something for me.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.293
Fuck you.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.295
Okay, well,

50:50.047 --> 50:51.131
enjoy your prize.

50:53.134 --> 50:54.134
What do I have to do?

50:54.343 --> 50:55.343
You like your job?

50:55.636 --> 50:56.678
Hell, no.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.322
Nobody's ever given you a break, right?

50:58.848 --> 51:00.223
Did you listen to my story?

51:00.474 --> 51:02.892
Yeah, and you excelled during your
service training.

51:02.977 --> 51:03.977
Excelled.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.271
You have skills you've never had
the chance to use

51:06.355 --> 51:07.731
and I can give you that chance.

51:08.441 --> 51:09.441
Let me put it this way.

51:10.109 --> 51:11.869
I hand him to you, you
do whatever you like.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.446
And when you're done, you try my job.

51:14.530 --> 51:15.850
You don't like it, you walk away.

51:18.242 --> 51:20.243
You're not talking about
bartending are you?

51:21.162 --> 51:23.163
I'm not talking about bartending.

51:23.914 --> 51:24.914
What is it?

51:25.916 --> 51:26.916
I'll show you.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.001
No. Fuck that, no.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.044
Stop playing games. Just tell me right now.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.422
Look, Robertson explains it so much better
than I do.

51:34.842 --> 51:35.842
Don't mess with me.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.094
What, you're working with Robertson?

51:38.179 --> 51:40.096
Yes, I am, and he wants me to help you.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.224
You're part of Robertson's
little secret society?

51:43.309 --> 51:44.309
Yes.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.269
Tell me what it's all about then.

51:48.397 --> 51:49.731
First things first.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.525
Jerry! I'm going on a break.

51:59.200 --> 52:00.325
Oh, fuck.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.043
Where is he?

52:10.503 --> 52:11.503
What, is he down there?

52:12.129 --> 52:14.369
Listen, you're just going to
have to trust me, all right?

52:15.216 --> 52:16.341
Now I must be drunk.

52:17.510 --> 52:18.968
You better not be fucking with me.

52:20.221 --> 52:22.180
You think I might be the Fizzle Bomber?

52:22.556 --> 52:23.556
Maybe.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.433
What if you're the Fizzle Bomber?

52:25.893 --> 52:26.935
What if I am?

52:28.062 --> 52:29.145
Well, come on.

52:29.271 --> 52:30.511
This is what you wanted, right?

52:30.564 --> 52:31.564
Come on.

52:35.528 --> 52:38.488
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i>

52:38.572 --> 52:39.572
Here we go.

52:40.199 --> 52:41.282
All right.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.953
Follow me right in here.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.832
Can't be too cautious these days.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.340
What are you doing?

53:00.261 --> 53:01.970
Killing somebody's not easy, you know.

53:04.390 --> 53:08.101
No matter how much hate and anger
you may have in your heart,

53:08.394 --> 53:10.228
when it comes time to pull the trigger

53:10.354 --> 53:11.479
most people can't do it.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.398
You speaking from experience?

53:13.816 --> 53:15.441
I'm just telling you the truth.

53:18.863 --> 53:19.946
Well, I'm not afraid.

53:20.114 --> 53:22.115
You bring him to me and I won't hesitate.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.117
All right, that's good.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.036
So, where is he?

53:27.121 --> 53:28.121
Hold your horses.

53:33.043 --> 53:34.127
What, are you going to play for me?

53:34.378 --> 53:36.129
No, no. I'm going to play you the past.

53:37.214 --> 53:41.467
This is a USFF Coordinates
Transformer Field Kit.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.052
No moving parts.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.847
It weighs approximately six kilos,
fully charged.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.641
I've adjusted it to support our body mass.

53:48.976 --> 53:51.603
It will calculate a
discreet arrival location

53:51.687 --> 53:54.939
and avoid any materialization collisions.

53:55.733 --> 53:56.733
So, what is it?

53:57.902 --> 54:00.653
It's a device that creates a temporal wake.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.238
A what?

54:02.907 --> 54:03.948
It's a time machine.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.285
You gotta be shitting me.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.330
No, I am not.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.334
Look, don't be alarmed, all right?

54:14.418 --> 54:15.501
You have to stand closer.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.211
You have to be within three feet.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.047
What have you got two guns for?

54:19.340 --> 54:20.340
Don't worry.

54:21.175 --> 54:22.175
I've done this a lot.

54:25.346 --> 54:27.506
Seriously, pal, you need to stop
playing games with me.

54:27.514 --> 54:29.974
Stand still, okay?

54:30.059 --> 54:31.434
Take a deep breath and hold this.

54:31.518 --> 54:34.395
Hold it.
It's okay. Here you go.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.544
Now, you just have to close your eyes.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.985
Why do I need to close my eyes...

54:48.202 --> 54:50.036
- God, what was that?
- Yeah.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.162
The time distortion field.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.206
- You're going to be fine.
- What?

54:53.457 --> 54:55.124
Just take some deep breaths, all right?

54:55.209 --> 54:56.209
What is this?

54:56.335 --> 54:57.585
Just take some deep breaths.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.800
The first few jumps can really
knock you around.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.840
- Jumps?
- Yeah.

55:03.217 --> 55:06.552
We're in Cleveland, Ohio, April 3rd, 1963.

55:09.348 --> 55:10.348
What?

55:10.516 --> 55:11.516
That's impossible.

55:11.934 --> 55:12.934
I know.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.853
Look, in this job you can't afford
to make any mistakes.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.689
Timing is essential.

55:19.358 --> 55:20.483
I've got some money for you.

55:20.734 --> 55:23.152
The Temporal Bureau doesn't care
how much money you spend.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.278
It doesn't matter to them.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.531
What they don't like is any
unnecessary anachronisms.

55:26.949 --> 55:27.991
The Temporal Bureau?

55:28.075 --> 55:29.450
Is that the company you work for?

55:29.576 --> 55:31.619
That's right. The one
you almost worked for.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.329
So, where's Robertson?

55:33.747 --> 55:35.123
He's in 1985.

55:35.833 --> 55:36.833
What?

55:37.251 --> 55:38.376
At Bureau headquarters.

55:42.297 --> 55:44.007
So what, you're a cop?

55:44.758 --> 55:46.467
I'm a Temporal Agent, one of 11.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.720
We prevent crime before it takes place.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.389
Here. Here's some clothes.
Put them on.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.310
Well, how did you know
the clothes would be there?

55:55.436 --> 55:57.478
Doesn't matter. We just need
to start blending in.

55:58.147 --> 55:59.439
What, have you been here before?

56:00.357 --> 56:01.691
It's complicated, all right?

56:02.443 --> 56:03.443
Yeah, no shit.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.528
Look, our time disruption footprint

56:05.612 --> 56:07.488
needs to be extremely small.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.991
The Bureau allows for slight variations

56:10.075 --> 56:12.076
but ultimately the parameters
are extremely strict.

56:12.161 --> 56:14.495
Any deviation from our mission
results in termination.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.205
Termination of your job?

56:16.290 --> 56:17.582
Termination of your life.

56:18.083 --> 56:20.710
That's why you want to keep your
conversations to people in this time period

56:21.045 --> 56:22.420
to an absolute minimum.

56:23.130 --> 56:24.130
This time period.

56:25.174 --> 56:27.633
Okay. So how far can you travel, then?

56:28.135 --> 56:32.138
Travel beyond 53 years of zero point,
either direction,

56:32.556 --> 56:34.474
will result in the temporal wake
disintegrating.

56:34.683 --> 56:35.683
Zero point?

56:37.311 --> 56:38.603
The invention of time travel.

56:38.729 --> 56:39.729
And when's that?

56:40.064 --> 56:42.356
It will be in 1981.

56:44.485 --> 56:45.485
Right.

56:46.487 --> 56:47.487
I can't believe this.

56:47.988 --> 56:49.030
And so,

56:49.114 --> 56:52.116
I get to be one of these, you know,
a Temporal Agent?

56:52.701 --> 56:54.118
If you prove yourself.

56:55.746 --> 56:56.746
Right.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.166
So what's this guy to you?

57:00.417 --> 57:03.586
Well, I'm starting to suspect that he might
be the Fizzle Bomber. All right?

57:03.754 --> 57:06.672
But all that's clear is he's the
main obstacle that's held you back.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.509
So, I kill him

57:10.344 --> 57:11.552
you take me to Robertson

57:11.637 --> 57:12.762
and you show me everything.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.138
Agreed.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.682
Right. Okay, so where is he?

57:16.767 --> 57:18.142
Okay. Hey, hey.

57:18.852 --> 57:19.852
Are you all right?

57:20.604 --> 57:21.604
Yeah.

57:22.397 --> 57:25.233
All right, he's at Cleveland College,
five blocks from here.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.860
You remember? He's on his way
to meet Jane. You.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.695
The 1963 you.

57:29.863 --> 57:30.988
Yeah, I remember.

57:31.073 --> 57:32.073
Okay, great.

57:33.867 --> 57:37.829
So, I can do this?
I can change my past?

57:38.205 --> 57:39.205
Yes, you can.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.250
Have you ever thought about
changing yours?

57:43.669 --> 57:45.294
I never deviate from the mission.

57:47.589 --> 57:49.340
- Never?
- Never.

57:51.552 --> 57:53.552
Look, I'll pick you up
when you're done, all right?

57:53.595 --> 57:55.138
No. Whoa, where are you going?

57:55.264 --> 57:57.473
Don't worry. I'll be around, trust me.

57:57.558 --> 57:58.558
Do I...

58:00.310 --> 58:01.602
Do I have a choice?

58:02.146 --> 58:03.896
Of course. You always have a choice.

58:04.398 --> 58:07.078
Yeah, but sometimes don't you think
that things are just inevitable?

58:09.236 --> 58:10.987
Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.

58:14.116 --> 58:15.825
This life.

58:16.743 --> 58:17.743
Is it lonely?

58:21.957 --> 58:22.957
No family.

58:24.585 --> 58:25.585
No.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.630
But, you do have a purpose.

58:33.886 --> 58:34.886
Right.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.187
Oh, I'm so sorry.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.023
Are you lost?

59:30.317 --> 59:31.609
No, I'm looking for someone.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.736
Thanks, I'll just wait.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.864
Well, you know what they say about
good things happening to those who wait.

59:43.497 --> 59:46.207
But only the things left behind
by those who hustle.

59:53.632 --> 59:55.466
I was thinking the exact same thing.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.260
What are the odds?

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.180
What are the odds.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:05.643
Are you okay?

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.855
You're not how I imagined you'd look.

01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:12.984
Do I know you?

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.530
You're beautiful.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.244
Someone should have told you that.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.541
Well, you just did.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.890
<i>If you ever want to stop the Fizzle Bomber</i>

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.393
<i>you'll never get another chance.</i>

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:40.793
Come on, come on.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.384
<i>Sometimes don't you think that things
are just inevitable?</i>

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.513
<i>Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.</i>

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.778
Time travel can be disorienting.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.865
Even short jumps
can knock you around a bit.

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.868
Don't ever exceed the jump limit.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.871
It can be problematic.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.416
Deep breaths.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:04.501
<i>They always help.</i>

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.721
I don't get out and meet
a lot of new people.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:20.934
Why not?

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.813
I don't know. I just don't.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.072
Are you nervous?

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:36.116
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:39.203
<i>Don't forget to buy a
hat, gloves and a jacket.</i>

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:41.747
It's cold this time of year, back in '64.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.043
This is a job, all right? Remember that.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:49.213
It's unlike any other, but you still have
tasks to perform

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.422
deadlines to meet.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:52.716
Some days those tasks
are easier than others

01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:55.177
but it's imperative that you succeed.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.684
<i>You always knew this day would come.</i>

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:07.856
You can do this.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.068
<i>Why don't you meet new people?</i>

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.489
I'm not very good in social situations.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.299
Some people just don't like me, I guess.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:18.784
Why is that, do you think?

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.452
I don't know.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.447
Perhaps it's because you think
you're better than them.

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.290
Excuse me?

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.240
Well, you think you're superior.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.796
Who the hell are you to...

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:32.005
You don't even know me.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.090
Am I wrong?

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:36.844
Takes one to know one.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:39.930
True.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:45.978
So, what makes you so superior?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.234
I can read minds.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.153
Oh, really?

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.321
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.574
All right, what am I thinking right now?

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.082
You're thinking,

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:10.169
"Charm class isn't helping this situation."

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.130
Wow. Amazing.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:15.674
You're thinking,

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:20.679
"Why does everyone always get
what they want and I get nothing?

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.814
"That I'm tired of being
tough all the time."

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.018
Everyone thinks that.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.062
You pretend like love

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.939
doesn't matter to you, when the truth is

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.859
it's all you ever think about.

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.068
That's not true.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.529
Okay.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.115
What, you don't believe me?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.742
You've known me for a whole hour.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.203
You've never been in love.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.078
That's none of your business.

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.040
That's not an answer.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.625
What makes you think you deserve one?

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:52.752
You're right.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.921
I'm sorry for being so direct.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.888
You said that I'm not how you imagined.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.223
Have we met before?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:05.890
No, I...

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:08.602
I don't know why I said that.

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:09.895
Because I feel like we have.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.899
Things haven't been easy
for you, have they?

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:17.986
Everyone's got problems.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.279
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.073
<i>We all trip up along the way.</i>

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.618
But you and I,

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.247
perhaps over the same things.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.209
<i>Mr. Robertson, it's good to see you again.</i>

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:33.877
It's been a while.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.087
Yes.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:40.384
From your perspective, I suppose it has.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.761
I didn't think you jumped anymore.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.805
Only on special occasions.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.975
I have a piece of the
Fizzle Bomber's timer.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:59.319
You made an illegal jump.
That's a serious offense.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.238
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.699
I had to try again.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.075
And did you apprehend him?

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:06.577
No.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:11.331
The fragments of matter you leave behind
after each jump

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.166
we can only repair so much.

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.794
The onset of psychosis, dementia.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.004
It can be serious.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:18.839
I'm fine.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.841
How many illegal jumps have you made?

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.092
Just one.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.007
I'll accept the punishment.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:33.437
The parameters set by the Bureau
are strict for a reason.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.814
They exist for our protection.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:38.901
However,

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.988
I've always thought we could accomplish
so much more

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:46.450
without the constant bureaucratic control
of the board.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.914
An Agent operating from the outside.

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.753
<i>She'll endure so much pain
because of what I do.</i>

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:00.005
That's the way it has to be.

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:02.341
That's the way it's always been.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.844
You should understand that
better than anyone.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:10.974
The snake that eats its own tail,
forever and ever.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.937
You are here to create history
and influence what is to come.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.939
I don't think I can do it.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.274
Understand

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:20.776
you are more than an Agent.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.860
You're a gift

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:23.320
given to the world through a

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:25.781
Predestination Paradox.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.282
You're the only one

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.910
free from history, ancestry.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.957
The rooster.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.251
But you must complete your mission.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.003
You must lay the seeds for the future.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.005
We're counting on you.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:48.470
And what happens when that day comes,
when I have no knowledge of my future?

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.017
Well, then, like everyone else

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:56.262
you're just going to have to take it
one day at a time.

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:42.357
You have a long journey ahead of you.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.995
<i>They say that the journey
of a thousand miles</i>

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.125
starts right at your feet.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:04.004
And my feet sure could use a rest.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.227
All right, just going to cover up your eyes

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:22.272
just to be safe, okay?

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:27.152
<i>Jumping back almost 20 years can be rough.</i>

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.570
<i>Hold the baby tight.</i>

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:29.654
You ready?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.282
<i>And remember, deep breaths.</i>

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:49.341
<i>Preparation is the key to successful,
inconspicuous time travel.</i>

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.347
<i>Luck is the residue of design.</i>

01:13:56.974 --> 01:13:59.351
<i>Earlier, I had registered
as Gregory Johnson,</i>

01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:00.519
<i>Warren, Ohio.</i>

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.479
<i>Keep it simple.</i>

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.022
<i>Blend in.</i>

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.537
Safe journey, Jane.

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:21.206
Stay strong, John.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.375
You have a bright future ahead.

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.065
City of Cleveland Orphanage.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.243
Stay here.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.120
Where are you going?

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:43.955
Don't worry.

01:15:44.832 --> 01:15:45.832
I'll be right back.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.028
You sick fuck.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.112
You tricked me.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.656
The choice was yours.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:18.782
What choice?

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.907
I'm not going to leave her.

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:24.329
That's the way that it is.

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.081
It's the way it always has been.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.291
I'm sorry if you feel deceived.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.337
But it's a mistake to think that we can
change certain events.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:35.006
Just like you said, some things
are inevitable.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.176
- But I love her.
- I know.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:39.803
I know that.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.013
And now that you've found her

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.641
you know who she is.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.185
And you understand who you are.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.648
And now maybe you're ready
to understand who I am.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:01.449
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.702
The shock will wear off

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:06.621
but you can take comfort in knowing
that these events

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:08.873
are happening in the correct order.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.168
The path you're on will take you
to your destination.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.046
Where is that?

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:17.590
You let me take you to Robertson
and he'll show you everything.

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.722
I don't want to leave her.

01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:31.021
You're not.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.192
I never wanted to hurt her.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.569
I know.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:39.904
And now she knows too.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:47.662
John.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.248
Listen to me, all right? You're home.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.791
Your troubles are over.

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.252
You're going to save millions of lives.

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:58.465
You're about to embark on the most
important job a man has ever had.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.343
And you're going to do great. I know.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.847
All right, he's forward jumped 22 years.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.491
He's not used to this kind of distance.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.270
John had to want this.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.189
His life had to be fouled up.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.691
He had to have nothing in order
to achieve so much.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.862
A hundred horrible crimes
didn't go as planned, because of him.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:22.447
Because of the work you've done.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:25.367
But the Fizzle Bomber's still out there.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:27.952
I failed.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.913
He made you a better Agent.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:31.081
We've all learned things from him.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:32.445
He's made us better at our jobs.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.127
This organization wouldn't have grown

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.879
if it wasn't for the Fizzle Bomber.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.049
You sound as if you admire him.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.384
He's a terrorist.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.968
Nothing's that simple.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.012
I wish that it were.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:51.684
What's this?

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:54.771
It's the timer.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.689
Got some new leads.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.153
When you reach your final destination

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:04.114
your Field Kit will decommission...

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:07.951
As per regulation.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.454
You sure you want to retire to New York

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:13.540
so close to the date of the blast?

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.042
Yes, sir.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.089
You take care of yourself.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.175
Yes, sir.

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:50.535
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i>

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.038
<i>I'm my own grandpa</i>

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.790
Jesus H. Christ, Conner!

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.001
Here, look, I'll refund your goddamn money.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.879
I don't want a refund. Just let me play
the damn song!

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.214
Yeah, come on, Jerry. Let him play
the damn song.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:04.549
And by the way, I quit.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:47.467
So, this is it.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:49.677
Home.

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:33.513
<i>The order finally came through today.</i>

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:36.349
<i>I guess it was inevitable.</i>

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:40.603
<i>By the time you listen to this seven years
will have passed.</i>

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.984
<i>Our first mission
is just as important as our last.</i>

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:49.988
<i>Each one getting us closer
to our final destination.</i>

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.448
<i>See, you'll find out that time</i>

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.909
<i>has a very different meaning
to people like us.</i>

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:59.914
<i>Time catches up with us all</i>

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.292
<i>even those in our line of work.</i>

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:05.003
<i>I guess you could say we're gifted.</i>

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:09.173
<i>God, Jesus, that sounds arrogant
saying it out loud.</i>

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:12.510
<i>All right, I'll put it a better way.</i>

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.429
<i>I guess you could say</i>

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.015
<i>we were born into this job.</i>

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:25.356
You don't see a lot of guys
using these anymore.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.525
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.193
It's just that...

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.529
I get kind of sentimental about the past.

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:33.573
That's cool.

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.701
Me too.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.286
I see.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.166
<i>So, you're a writer?</i>

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.543
<i>I used to be, I guess.</i>

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.641
<i>And you're thinking of taking it up again?</i>

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.089
I was thinking about it.

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.300
- Right on.
- Yeah.

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:53.704
What kind of things do you write?

01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:56.387
Oh, just confession stories.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:00.141
<i>What, kind of like those
scorned women stories?</i>

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:04.020
You know, passion, heartbreak, jealousy.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:06.648
No, not kinda like, exactly like.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.233
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.654
<i>You don't look like the type of guy
that'd be into that.</i>

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.075
What do I look like I would be into?

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.245
That's a big question.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:25.166
<i>Well, you're interested in this
gorgeous '40 Royal Portable.</i>

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.250
<i>I am.</i>

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:29.921
Tool of choice for Hemingway,
Kerouac, Fleming.

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:33.091
And taking into account I've known you
for a whole 30 seconds...

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:36.010
<i>I'm thinking you're into adventure.</i>

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.512
<i>Suspense.</i>

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.138
<i>Maybe a touch of romance.</i>

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:43.059
And definitely a big splash of murder.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:46.145
- That's stupid, right?
- No, it's not.

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.940
It's never too late to be who
you might have been.

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:13.631
<i>It's not just the physical injuries.</i>

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.092
<i>You've logged more field hours</i>

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.678
than any of the other Agents
I've been assigned to.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.639
<i>The risks are real.</i>

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.689
<i>The fragments of matter
you leave behind after each jump</i>

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.649
<i>we can only repair so much.</i>

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:33.693
The onset of psychosis, dementia.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.194
That can be serious.

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:36.279
I'm fine.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.284
<i>Time travel can be disorienting.</i>

01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:43.995
<i>Don't ever exceed the jump limit.</i>

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.164
It can be problematic.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.211
<i>The snake that eats its own tail</i>

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.338
<i>forever and ever.</i>

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.258
<i>I know where I come from.</i>

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.511
<i>But where do all you zombies come from?</i>

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:27.789
Oh, my God.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.168
You look good.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:36.589
I missed you.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:39.801
You're the Fizzle Bomber?

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:45.640
We always hated that name, remember?

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.559
You're a murderer.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:53.147
No, no, no. See, I've saved lives,
more than I ever could have

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.690
from inside the bureau.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.734
No, you kill innocent people.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:58.611
Innocent people.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:25:59.695
No, no, no.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.657
I have clippings from the future.

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:05.660
Clippings from futures that never happened

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.662
because I prevented them.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:12.208
More tragedies prevented, lives saved.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.334
You see this?

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.294
- Saved?
- Yeah, yeah. Look.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.464
Look. 1974, Chicago chemical spill.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.967
That driver never made it to work
in the morning.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:25.221
Now, 324 lives saved.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.473
Look, look. What's next? What's next?

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:33.604
Right, well we have... We have 1991,
April 3rd, Hamburg, Germany.

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:37.316
1,861 lives saved.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:41.737
The Hardshaw Weapons Factory Heist, 1968.

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:45.062
You know, the terrorists never came in the
building because I blew it the fuck up.

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:48.786
3,027 lives I saved.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.206
Do you keep count of all the civilians
you killed as well?

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:56.294
Your next attack will kill 10,000 more.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.756
You're disappointed in me, right?

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:03.217
I remember that, I do.

01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:04.969
But when the dust settles

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.724
I think you'll see that
we did the right thing.

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:12.268
I will never become you.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.770
No, I'm curious.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.814
Did you report

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:20.318
that your decommissioned Field Kit
didn't decommission?

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.820
Right?

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:25.656
Some people say that it's fate.

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:27.950
But you and I,

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.493
we know

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.454
some things are predestined.

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:34.582
I made you who you are.
You made me who I am.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.917
It's a paradox, right?

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.835
But it can't be paradoctored.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:40.504
Right?

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:43.674
I had so much fun at preempting you, I did.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:46.344
And now you're free and you found me

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:48.804
and we can be together.

01:27:49.348 --> 01:27:50.640
I'll never become you.

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:51.724
Don't say that.

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:52.892
Don't say that.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.602
We're just puppets.

01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:57.480
We are Robertson.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:58.689
He set the whole thing up.

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:01.025
He played us for fools.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:02.693
He's laying out the dominoes.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.445
You know, we're just watching it fall.

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:06.822
I will never become you

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:09.784
and I will not let you kill those people.

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:10.868
Wait, wait, wait.

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:13.371
What, you're gonna live a regular life

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:16.374
with that bitch, Alice,
from the antique store?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.668
She has a stupid cat,

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:21.963
she has a disgusting birthmark
on her left hip.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:23.714
She's a lousy fucking cook.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:24.799
Okay, trust me.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.634
She can't handle our secrets.

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.970
She can't, trust me.
She's not right for us.

01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:33.474
You have no idea what is right for me.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.811
Okay, okay, okay, all
we have is each other.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:39.563
It is all we've ever had.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:41.774
Now if you shoot me

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:43.693
you'll become me.

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:45.736
You get it?

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.405
That's how it happens.

01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.490
If you want to break the chain

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.367
you have to not kill me

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:56.580
but try to love me, again.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:00.418
What if I put him in front of you,

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:03.254
the man who ruined your life...

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:06.841
Forget all that.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.759
We can have a future together.

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:10.428
Would you kill him

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.388
to save thousands?

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.192
You wanna know what
we're gonna do tomorrow?

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:17.601
No.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.042
<i>Here you are</i>

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.878
<i>at the beginning of your new life.</i>

01:29:45.464 --> 01:29:47.089
<i>It can be overwhelming</i>

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.717
<i>knowing the future you're about to create.</i>

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.054
<i>Knowing the purpose of that life.</i>

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.682
You know who she is.

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.394
And you understand who you are.

01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:03.856
And now maybe you're ready
to understand who I am.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:09.737
You see I love her, too.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.737
<i>You'll have to make tough choices.</i>

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:54.907
<i>You'll influence the past.</i>

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.536
<i>Can we change our futures?</i>

01:30:59.663 --> 01:31:00.663
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:04.583
<i>The only thing that I know for sure</i>

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:08.712
<i>is that you are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:13.884
<i>I miss you dreadfully.</i>

01:31:14.305 --> 01:31:20.496
