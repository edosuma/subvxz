05:17.283 --> 05:19.284
<i>Alright, so disgusting</i>

06:49.876 --> 06:51.977
Ms. Kang, I saw the manuscript

06:51.978 --> 06:53.389
Ms. Kang...

06:54.914 --> 06:56.518
Kang Ji-yun.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.059
How do you know the secret of
my mom's death?

07:02.989 --> 07:06.792
Only she and I were there

07:06.793 --> 07:09.027
So how the hell do you know?!

07:09.028 --> 07:11.770
How did you find out?!

07:25.478 --> 07:26.855
Is someone there?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.893
Who is it?

08:02.548 --> 08:04.357
Anyone there?
Please open the door!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.487
Hello? Anyone there?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.762
Hello?!

08:23.903 --> 08:25.109
Who are you?

08:26.572 --> 08:29.241
Why are you doing this to me?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.842
Who is it? Come out!

08:30.843 --> 08:31.981
Come out!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.486
Kang! Is that you?!

09:35.441 --> 09:40.754
KILLER TOON

09:41.347 --> 09:43.515
Suh Mi-sook,
head of Daum webcomic,

09:43.516 --> 09:45.223
she was 39 years old

09:45.918 --> 09:47.886
Estimated time
of death is 1 a.m.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.856
According to the security log,
she was alone in the office

09:51.857 --> 09:53.792
until she was discovered
by a janitor at 6

09:53.793 --> 09:55.260
That all you got?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.963
And that CCTV

09:57.964 --> 09:59.931
I combed the footage,

09:59.932 --> 10:03.880
but after 11 p.m.,
no one else came in or out

10:06.072 --> 10:07.038
And that?

10:07.039 --> 10:10.509
It's... not possible to
exit through there

10:14.947 --> 10:17.482
Then it's obvious

10:17.483 --> 10:19.217
Suicide

10:19.218 --> 10:21.926
Let's not jump to conclusions

10:23.522 --> 10:24.830
And this?

10:25.524 --> 10:27.492
It's locked, so not yet

10:27.493 --> 10:30.497
Should I look into
probable cause first?

10:31.263 --> 10:32.241
Sure

10:32.999 --> 10:37.302
Check the call log,
question her colleagues

10:37.303 --> 10:38.941
Regardless...

10:39.905 --> 10:43.441
of the outcome,
you handle the case

10:43.442 --> 10:44.809
What?

10:44.810 --> 10:49.810
Captain and I have
promotion to think of

10:49.849 --> 10:51.416
Promotion?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.818
And since you're primary,
you'll take the heat?

10:53.819 --> 10:59.462
You're fully capable of
handling a suicide case, prick

11:00.893 --> 11:01.894
Boss!

11:03.429 --> 11:05.463
What now?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.809
You should come check this out

11:58.451 --> 12:03.354
Are you alone?
It's dangerous out here

12:03.355 --> 12:05.857
Running an errand

12:05.858 --> 12:09.461
Miss, my house is
just up this way,

12:09.462 --> 12:11.271
could you drive me?

12:20.072 --> 12:25.072
You're such a nice kid,
do you live nearby?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.815
Yeah, that Hog Farm

12:30.216 --> 12:32.217
Pretty shoes

12:32.218 --> 12:33.785
What's your name?

12:33.786 --> 12:35.053
Mi-jin

12:35.054 --> 12:36.533
Mi-jin

12:37.890 --> 12:40.058
Pretty name too,
how old are you?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.363
Liar

12:45.364 --> 12:48.967
You look no more than 10

12:48.968 --> 12:51.069
That's when I died

12:51.070 --> 12:52.014
What?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.182
<i>Help me</i>

13:02.114 --> 13:03.923
<i>Help me</i>

14:49.255 --> 14:51.326
<i>Hog Farm Area contaminated</i>

15:00.833 --> 15:02.200
- She's clean
- What?

15:02.201 --> 15:06.149
Corpses are the best witnesses
but this one's a mute

15:07.072 --> 15:09.607
No sign of intrusion
at the scene?

15:09.608 --> 15:10.643
None

15:11.210 --> 15:14.812
Prints on the knife
were all hers

15:14.813 --> 15:16.514
Same thing here

15:16.515 --> 15:19.792
Cause of death is severing of
carotid artery here,

15:20.753 --> 15:23.757
with the Xacto knife
in her hand

15:25.057 --> 15:30.057
From the way it looks,
she must've punctured it

15:30.162 --> 15:32.130
What is that?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.611
Nothing, go on

15:35.467 --> 15:37.535
What baffled me...

15:37.536 --> 15:38.803
is this pan

15:38.804 --> 15:43.074
It was inflicted before death,
must've been very painful

15:43.075 --> 15:48.525
So you're saying
it's self inflicted?

15:49.481 --> 15:52.087
- Are you insane?
- Yeah

15:52.618 --> 15:54.786
Insanity is the only answer

15:54.787 --> 15:58.456
Scientifically,
it's definitively a suicide

15:58.457 --> 16:01.626
My instincts say it's a murder!

16:01.627 --> 16:03.328
Your instincts?

16:03.329 --> 16:05.172
You're at it again?

16:06.065 --> 16:09.342
Asshole, I'm not falling
for it anymore

16:10.536 --> 16:13.171
You know the new commissioner?

16:13.172 --> 16:14.150
Yeah

16:14.206 --> 16:16.741
He likes big, bold
headline cases

16:16.742 --> 16:18.221
Of course

16:19.378 --> 16:21.079
You idiot

16:21.080 --> 16:25.222
Then this is the perfect case

16:26.085 --> 16:30.188
A famous artist's work
unfolds in real life

16:30.189 --> 16:32.323
Can't you feel it?

16:32.324 --> 16:36.160
So play up the media with this?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.161
Right

16:37.162 --> 16:42.339
Whatever happens,
we'd be linked to big cases

16:46.472 --> 16:50.308
Woke up somewhere else again?

16:50.309 --> 16:51.253
<i>Yes</i>

16:52.044 --> 16:54.388
An unfamiliar road this time

16:55.614 --> 16:58.049
Don't even remember driving

16:58.050 --> 17:00.621
Was it a nightmare?

17:01.820 --> 17:04.096
It doesn't feel like
a dream anymore

17:05.324 --> 17:08.669
Not a nightmare, but real life

17:10.128 --> 17:13.770
Like in the dream,
things disappear,

17:14.433 --> 17:17.607
and I wake up with
mysterious scars

17:20.138 --> 17:23.708
Heard of
Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome?

17:23.709 --> 17:28.709
It's a syndrome that the author
Lewis Carroll suffered

17:29.348 --> 17:33.151
The fictional world and
reality collide

17:33.152 --> 17:37.655
and the wall of reality collapses,

17:37.656 --> 17:42.765
it's a symptom that
artists sometimes get

17:43.529 --> 17:50.469
As dreams and reality collide,
it affects your senses

17:51.670 --> 17:55.015
Rest is the best treatment,
so take it easy

17:57.509 --> 18:00.513
Yeah, let's rest

18:01.513 --> 18:02.821
Rest

18:05.784 --> 18:07.821
<i>Embalmer Jo</i>

18:08.720 --> 18:11.064
<i>Electrocuted while
working on subway rail</i>

18:32.544 --> 18:33.488
Shit!

18:35.514 --> 18:36.618
Fuck me

18:37.149 --> 18:38.890
That startled me

18:48.093 --> 18:49.827
Made contact?

18:49.828 --> 18:53.397
Yes, I notified the victim's family

18:53.398 --> 18:55.066
But it was so awkward

18:55.067 --> 18:57.602
They kept saying she had
no reason to kill herself...

18:57.603 --> 19:00.905
No, I meant the artist!

19:00.906 --> 19:03.147
Her cell phone's still off

19:04.476 --> 19:06.477
No other contact info?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.613
Coroner ruled it a suicide?

19:08.614 --> 19:10.025
Should I write it up?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.953
Yo, useless prick

19:15.954 --> 19:18.489
Just do what you're told

19:18.490 --> 19:20.591
Ruled a suicide no evidence,

19:20.592 --> 19:22.560
there's no case here

19:22.561 --> 19:24.629
You just sit back,
I'll take care of it

19:24.630 --> 19:27.598
Take care of what?

19:27.599 --> 19:32.446
Finally, now you want to
work efficiently?

19:33.438 --> 19:35.782
Only took 3 years under you

19:39.444 --> 19:40.711
Forget it

19:40.712 --> 19:44.815
I submitted the report,
just work on case plan

19:44.816 --> 19:46.484
I got a kid on the way
next month

19:46.485 --> 19:49.694
Why is that relevant?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.390
Well, it's just...

19:52.391 --> 19:53.691
What?

19:53.692 --> 19:56.027
I need paternity leave too

19:56.028 --> 19:57.395
I'll take good...

19:57.396 --> 20:00.798
You're a real piece of work

20:00.799 --> 20:02.142
Paternity leave my ass

20:46.111 --> 20:47.089
Ms. Suh!

20:49.748 --> 20:51.125
Ms. Suh!

20:58.624 --> 21:01.058
This is really unexpected

21:01.059 --> 21:02.970
Please come inside

21:03.862 --> 21:05.842
I left my cell phone off...

22:02.521 --> 22:03.431
Anyone home?

22:05.957 --> 22:07.402
Ms. Kang Ji-yun?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.439
I'm from the police

22:14.966 --> 22:16.377
Suicide?

22:18.537 --> 22:21.439
The Ms. Suh I know
would never do that

22:21.440 --> 22:24.978
Do you always work here?

22:26.812 --> 22:27.654
Yes

22:29.147 --> 22:30.387
Then,

22:34.686 --> 22:37.496
did you draw this here too?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.700
How do you have that?

22:41.493 --> 22:45.096
It was the last thing
she saw before her demise

22:45.097 --> 22:46.864
Was it your manuscript?

22:46.865 --> 22:50.568
Yes, I sent it
as soon as it was done

22:50.569 --> 22:55.473
Has anyone seen this
other than you two?

22:55.474 --> 22:57.174
Probably not

22:57.175 --> 22:59.443
I uploaded it to her server,

22:59.444 --> 23:02.448
and the designers get it
after her approval

23:03.582 --> 23:06.717
- Maybe someone you...
- Never

23:06.718 --> 23:08.026
Not one

23:09.921 --> 23:11.923
Not a single person

23:12.624 --> 23:14.558
Perhaps an intern
or a visitor to the studio...

23:14.559 --> 23:15.629
Never!

23:16.862 --> 23:19.741
I work here alone

23:21.767 --> 23:26.404
I sign my work
with my blood as a seal

23:26.405 --> 23:27.509
Blood?

23:28.707 --> 23:31.409
People say I'm making
a big deal,

23:31.410 --> 23:35.449
but my work is a pan of me,
it's very symbolic

23:39.985 --> 23:41.652
What's this all about?

23:41.653 --> 23:45.601
You were the last person
she called

23:54.065 --> 23:56.000
I didn't receive it

23:56.001 --> 23:58.675
After submitting it
I turn my phone off

23:59.571 --> 24:01.812
- Hey!
- Let go!

24:07.646 --> 24:10.381
These are Ms. Suh's
autopsy photos

24:10.382 --> 24:12.883
The coroner ruled it a suicide,

24:12.884 --> 24:16.987
but I don't think
she killed herself

24:16.988 --> 24:18.695
Because of this

24:20.459 --> 24:23.427
This is the fatal stab wound

24:23.428 --> 24:25.896
It's an inch deep into the neck

24:25.897 --> 24:29.867
It's not just a stab wound
but a hole bored into her

24:29.868 --> 24:34.705
Before she died
her face was slashed...

24:34.706 --> 24:38.843
many times,
and they're self inflicted

24:38.844 --> 24:43.844
It's the same method as
your protagonist's death

24:45.450 --> 24:47.551
One more thing

24:47.552 --> 24:48.622
Look

24:50.455 --> 24:52.435
Spirits playing a trick?

24:54.526 --> 24:58.696
At first I thought
it was a copycat

24:58.697 --> 25:00.438
Where were you on that night?

25:05.203 --> 25:06.876
Home...

25:07.939 --> 25:10.112
I was working at home

25:10.842 --> 25:12.219
Can you verify that?

25:19.084 --> 25:20.154
Boss!

25:20.852 --> 25:23.354
It's Suh's last call

25:23.355 --> 25:25.767
She left a voice message

25:26.825 --> 25:28.792
<i>Ms. Kang, I saw the manuscript</i>

25:28.793 --> 25:31.364
<i>Ms. Kang...</i>

25:32.330 --> 25:36.367
how do you know the secret of
my <i>mom's</i> death?

25:36.368 --> 25:39.403
Only she and <i>I</i> were there

25:39.404 --> 25:41.205
<i>So how the hell...</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:43.807
<i>I've never told
anyone in my life!</i>

25:43.808 --> 25:46.186
So how the hell do you know?!

25:48.713 --> 25:52.783
<i>The fictional world
and reality collide,</i>

25:52.784 --> 25:55.386
<i>and the wall of reality collapses...</i>

25:55.387 --> 26:00.894
<i>It's the same method as
your protagonist's death</i>

26:15.907 --> 26:17.975
<i>Embalmer Jo</i>

26:17.976 --> 26:21.185
<i>Electrocuted while
working on subway rail</i>

26:33.758 --> 26:35.092
Moron

26:35.093 --> 26:36.868
What is it?

26:37.495 --> 26:38.729
This is...

26:38.730 --> 26:41.165
you can make calls,
browse the Internet,

26:41.166 --> 26:45.803
and most importantly,
you can read comics

26:45.804 --> 26:47.137
Heard of webcomics?

26:47.138 --> 26:50.908
Dumbass, still reading
kiddie books? Act your age!

26:50.909 --> 26:52.843
Fuck that,
you're a techno illiterate

26:52.844 --> 26:54.878
"Fuck" what?!
Whatcha call me?

26:54.879 --> 26:57.314
Don't do that!
It will break!

26:57.315 --> 26:58.988
Just marry it, why don't you!

27:00.185 --> 27:02.461
This right here is a phone

27:03.421 --> 27:04.957
Hello, Best Funeral Home

27:05.790 --> 27:06.768
Where?

27:07.158 --> 27:07.932
Okay

27:08.393 --> 27:10.461
Electrocution?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.363
The paramedics didn't do...

27:12.364 --> 27:14.865
No, we can take care of it

27:14.866 --> 27:17.001
Okay, thank you

27:17.002 --> 27:18.402
It's double! Hear that?

27:18.403 --> 27:22.172
I, uh, it's my grandma's
memorial service

27:22.173 --> 27:23.774
Hwa-sook again?

27:23.775 --> 27:26.377
- She's just a friend
- You useless shit

27:26.378 --> 27:28.712
I loved my grandma!

27:28.713 --> 27:31.853
Forget it, dumb-ass,
what's the point?

27:32.350 --> 27:35.219
Generosity is wasted
on the living

27:35.220 --> 27:39.456
At least the dead
put food on my table

27:39.457 --> 27:40.834
Know that?

27:42.093 --> 27:43.163
Go to Hwa-sook

27:45.363 --> 27:46.740
Drop me off then

27:56.875 --> 27:57.979
Daughter?

27:58.476 --> 27:59.743
How did you know?

27:59.744 --> 28:02.079
It doesn't have the thing

28:02.080 --> 28:03.252
Penis

28:03.848 --> 28:07.819
These are private matters!

28:08.753 --> 28:10.391
I'm just jealous that's all

28:12.490 --> 28:15.300
Congrats, prick

28:16.895 --> 28:17.828
For what?

28:17.829 --> 28:22.829
You wanted out of this case
for paternity leave and shit

28:22.834 --> 28:25.869
I'm sending you to
unit ♪2 as support

28:25.870 --> 28:27.474
You're luring me?

28:28.339 --> 28:33.177
I work just fine without
a useless prick like you

28:33.178 --> 28:35.245
It's so weird

28:35.246 --> 28:37.726
I know you're not that smart,

28:39.250 --> 28:42.352
but your instincts
and timing are perfect

28:42.353 --> 28:44.188
Enough, buddy

28:44.189 --> 28:47.725
Why don't you just ask politely?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.138
"Let's work this case, please"

28:54.032 --> 28:57.775
Let's work the case,
you useless prick

28:59.037 --> 29:00.738
I accept your request

29:00.739 --> 29:01.972
Thank you very much

29:01.973 --> 29:04.041
To celebrate!

29:04.042 --> 29:04.908
What is it?

29:04.909 --> 29:06.946
Proof that you still got it

29:09.781 --> 29:12.716
I met Suh's family
and found this

29:12.717 --> 29:15.425
It's identical to Kang's comic

29:24.329 --> 29:26.864
Oh shit!

29:26.865 --> 29:28.936
Your skin's gonna peel off!

29:30.201 --> 29:32.738
Goddammit!

29:33.772 --> 29:36.548
Double pay is hardly enough!

29:37.175 --> 29:40.952
That idiot's screwing
a living bitch, and I'm here...

29:45.283 --> 29:46.049
What's this?

29:46.050 --> 29:48.852
That fucking idiot
left this in here?

29:48.853 --> 29:51.922
He's gonna bitch at me
for breaking it

29:51.923 --> 29:54.563
What a piece of shit!

29:55.293 --> 29:57.432
Even this pisses me off

30:18.349 --> 30:21.489
Wait, the legs were...

30:23.354 --> 30:25.425
What the hell...

30:27.425 --> 30:28.665
I'm drunk

30:35.733 --> 30:37.269
Shit!

30:42.907 --> 30:44.580
I must be drunk

30:49.280 --> 30:51.548
If you're dead,
just go to hell in peace

30:51.549 --> 30:53.460
Startling me and shit

30:56.754 --> 30:58.631
I gotta quit drinking

31:05.530 --> 31:08.465
Now it works

31:08.466 --> 31:10.377
A good ol' beating is
always the answer

31:40.698 --> 31:44.441
<i>Taking care of the sick
is scarier than hell...</i>

31:47.972 --> 31:50.851
Taking care of the sick
is scarier than hell...

31:51.676 --> 31:56.557
You'd be called a Buddha
if you did that for 10 years

31:58.349 --> 32:01.819
You did all you can
for her in 5 years

32:04.923 --> 32:08.336
Know what I thought
after her passing?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.036
'Now...

32:13.631 --> 32:17.443
I can sleep peacefully
for once'

32:18.336 --> 32:19.747
Shit

32:22.440 --> 32:24.044
That was it

32:45.663 --> 32:46.573
Sir

32:49.300 --> 32:50.574
Should we start?

32:52.370 --> 32:53.770
Go outside

32:53.771 --> 32:54.909
Sir?

32:55.573 --> 32:57.883
I'll do it myself, so go away!

32:59.444 --> 33:00.616
NOW!

33:24.769 --> 33:26.749
Honey...

33:37.849 --> 33:39.851
Goddammit...

34:03.941 --> 34:05.921
Help me, please

34:06.744 --> 34:08.746
Honey... please...

34:10.447 --> 34:12.257
Grant mercy and peace!

34:13.484 --> 34:15.395
To the deceased!

34:16.754 --> 34:18.422
Please!

34:18.422 --> 34:22.359
Sweetie! Let me live!

34:22.360 --> 34:24.306
Do me this favor!

34:34.438 --> 34:38.942
Suh's mom, this diary,
they all existed...

34:38.943 --> 34:43.322
And she died
as seen in the comic

34:43.947 --> 34:48.947
If the work was not released,
then Kang's the only suspect

34:49.387 --> 34:54.387
But only Suh's prints were
recovered at the scene

34:55.659 --> 34:58.334
It can't be premeditated

34:59.363 --> 35:02.833
- Gotta be something...
- Then what's your take?

35:06.871 --> 35:08.748
What?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.415
<i>Electrocuted while
working on subway rail</i>

35:32.363 --> 35:35.344
Boss, it's the same

35:38.336 --> 35:40.337
Can't be!

35:40.338 --> 35:42.284
Dammit, where is this?!

36:04.929 --> 36:06.296
Let go!

36:06.297 --> 36:08.868
Let go of me!

36:23.948 --> 36:27.862
Grant mercy and peace!
To the deceased!

36:30.955 --> 36:32.434
What was that?

36:34.525 --> 36:35.299
Come out, now!

36:57.982 --> 37:00.462
<i>Bus Route 3418</i>

37:05.957 --> 37:07.493
<i>Police Hospital</i>

37:18.402 --> 37:20.737
Okay, call all hospitals
with a morgue

37:20.738 --> 37:23.344
He must be working
at one of them, got that?

37:24.041 --> 37:26.910
Boss! You actually believe this?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.712
You trust my instincts, right?

37:28.713 --> 37:29.851
This is insane!

37:52.303 --> 37:53.304
Come out!

38:10.288 --> 38:11.926
Open up!

38:13.324 --> 38:14.359
Fucking Open!

39:50.354 --> 39:52.891
Police hospital?
I got it

39:53.924 --> 39:56.726
Can civies enter
a police hospital?

39:56.727 --> 39:58.434
It's still a hospital

39:58.996 --> 40:01.464
Kang's not answering

40:01.465 --> 40:02.773
Keep trying!

40:07.304 --> 40:08.681
<i>Police Hospital</i>

41:34.258 --> 41:35.430
Boss, this way

41:40.130 --> 41:42.235
I'm sorry...

41:44.468 --> 41:45.970
Don't kill me

42:01.785 --> 42:04.425
Please stop!

42:50.267 --> 42:51.405
Mister!

42:55.873 --> 42:56.943
Are you okay?

43:03.948 --> 43:04.926
Sir!

43:05.683 --> 43:07.984
Please... please!

43:07.985 --> 43:10.090
Go away!

43:11.288 --> 43:12.733
Goddamn fuck

43:13.324 --> 43:15.998
I said I'm sorry

43:17.828 --> 43:21.799
Please, I'm begging you

43:43.988 --> 43:45.695
Spare me

43:54.465 --> 43:55.239
Don't move!

43:58.068 --> 44:00.837
- Ms. Kang
- He's dead

44:00.838 --> 44:04.786
You are under arrest
for the murder of Jo Sun-ki

44:13.083 --> 44:18.083
So you went there to save him?

44:19.223 --> 44:21.134
That's your claim?

44:22.459 --> 44:23.359
Yes

44:23.360 --> 44:26.195
By analyzing your drawings?

44:26.196 --> 44:30.333
'Cos ghost in the comic
will kill him?

44:30.334 --> 44:32.702
So the ghost was the killer?

44:32.703 --> 44:37.340
I'm not sure what it was,

44:37.341 --> 44:38.649
but...

44:40.778 --> 44:42.951
- a woman...
- Ms. Kang

44:50.754 --> 44:52.789
Why did you lie to me?

44:52.790 --> 44:55.999
You claimed you were at home
when Suh was killed

44:57.227 --> 45:01.097
And got arrested
at the scene of Jo's death,

45:01.098 --> 45:05.735
but you blame it on a ghost?
It was you all along!

45:05.736 --> 45:10.339
No! Why would I kill them?

45:10.340 --> 45:11.648
Why?

45:12.743 --> 45:15.378
<i>Ms. Kang... Kang Ji-yun,</i>

45:15.379 --> 45:18.014
how do you know the secret of
my <i>mom's</i> death?

45:18.015 --> 45:23.328
And it's verified that
Jo embalmed his wife himself

45:24.354 --> 45:25.924
It can't be...

45:29.426 --> 45:32.328
It's all made up...

45:32.329 --> 45:33.996
A figment of my imagination

45:33.997 --> 45:35.271
Imagination?

45:39.970 --> 45:42.041
Then how do you explain this?

45:43.173 --> 45:47.910
I thought it was
a copycat murder at first,

45:47.911 --> 45:51.414
but how do you explain
the details of her life?

45:51.415 --> 45:52.415
That's...

45:52.416 --> 45:55.818
Reveal someone's big secret
to create a big hit,

45:55.819 --> 45:57.887
and as if that's not enough,

45:57.888 --> 46:01.190
if your comic came true,
then it'd be a sensation

46:01.191 --> 46:02.959
- How close am I?
- No, I could never

46:02.960 --> 46:05.795
Past and the future unfold
exactly as your work,

46:05.796 --> 46:08.331
who else can explain this better?

46:08.332 --> 46:10.366
No, I didn't kill anyone

46:10.367 --> 46:13.770
You planned and carried out
these killings!

46:13.771 --> 46:15.438
- No, no
- You killed them!

46:15.439 --> 46:17.039
You created these stories!

46:17.040 --> 46:18.941
They're not mine!

46:18.942 --> 46:20.012
I just...

46:22.746 --> 46:24.419
I just copied...

46:25.716 --> 46:26.922
Copied?

46:31.855 --> 46:33.232
My stories...

46:36.226 --> 46:37.796
aren't mine

46:38.862 --> 46:40.739
They're not

46:51.742 --> 46:54.313
<i>It was this time last year</i>

46:54.678 --> 46:58.848
<i>My “History of Lunacy“ was
a huge success</i>

46:58.849 --> 47:01.951
<i>Not only online
but as a hook too</i>

47:01.952 --> 47:05.254
<i>My readers revered me,</i>

47:05.255 --> 47:08.168
<i>and Daum signed me
with the highest advance,</i>

47:08.792 --> 47:11.238
<i>even without a project
in the works</i>

47:12.429 --> 47:16.265
<i>But my happiness
didn't last long,</i>

47:16.266 --> 47:18.467
<i>because my mind went
complete blank</i>

47:18.468 --> 47:19.402
<i>Editor-in-chief Suh</i>

47:19.403 --> 47:21.849
<i>I could not draw a single image</i>

47:23.774 --> 47:27.722
<i>Then only day,
I received an e-mail</i>

47:29.746 --> 47:32.989
<i>I thought it was spam,
so I erased it at first</i>

47:34.852 --> 47:39.222
<i>But it contained the story
that I wanted to draw</i>

47:39.223 --> 47:41.858
<i>I never found out who sent it</i>

47:41.859 --> 47:44.227
<i>Or why it was sent to me</i>

47:44.228 --> 47:50.008
And those images were
never before seen <i>by</i> anyone

47:52.769 --> 47:57.081
Soon <i>I</i> waited desperately
all day for the e-mail

48:03.247 --> 48:04.248
Dammit!

48:17.694 --> 48:22.939
<i>My greed as an artist
trumped my conscience</i>

48:24.434 --> 48:27.472
It's the same,
like it was photocopied

48:28.372 --> 48:29.442
Det. Kim!

48:30.474 --> 48:31.953
Det. Kim!

48:32.943 --> 48:34.510
Yeah, what?

48:34.511 --> 48:35.751
Whatcha doing?

48:36.813 --> 48:40.416
I... am a fan, actually

48:40.417 --> 48:42.418
I'm thinking of taking one

48:42.419 --> 48:44.831
Sir! This is a crime scene!

48:45.656 --> 48:49.661
I kid, I kid!
So prickly

48:50.427 --> 48:53.362
- Got everything?
- Of course

48:53.363 --> 48:55.331
Everything's here on the PC

48:55.332 --> 48:57.300
Brass balls on her

48:57.301 --> 49:01.443
People went nuts over her,
but she's a total fraud

49:02.773 --> 49:05.074
There's more upstairs
Please take a look

49:05.075 --> 49:06.281
Sure

49:11.481 --> 49:13.582
Boss, it's Young-su

49:13.583 --> 49:16.752
Yes, we got the evidence

49:16.753 --> 49:21.532
<i>Okay, check</i> the JP of the sender
and get the real address

49:33.470 --> 49:35.279
<i>6 Years ago...</i>

49:39.910 --> 49:41.911
<i>Seriously?
You're a cop now!</i>

49:41.912 --> 49:44.013
Yeah! I passed! I passed!

49:44.014 --> 49:46.349
<i>Amazing! I love you!</i>

49:46.350 --> 49:48.484
Finally, I'm not
a freeloader anymore!

49:48.485 --> 49:51.554
- Awesome!
- This is it!

49:51.555 --> 49:54.399
Let's get married!

49:55.792 --> 49:57.860
<i>I'm gonna tell dad,
don't hang up!</i>

49:57.861 --> 49:58.928
All right

49:58.929 --> 50:01.864
<i>Dad! Young-su got into
the academy!</i>

50:01.865 --> 50:05.836
Young-su, baby!
I'm proud of you!

50:38.368 --> 50:39.642
<i>Hog Farm</i>

51:10.600 --> 51:12.273
Excuse me

51:14.471 --> 51:15.745
Are you the detective?

51:16.073 --> 51:18.074
What's wrong with it?

51:18.075 --> 51:21.744
Looks like someone split
a wire from this addy

51:21.745 --> 51:23.918
Bootlegged?

51:24.948 --> 51:28.751
Who knows,
but the way it looks,

51:28.752 --> 51:31.287
it's been there for a few years

51:31.288 --> 51:34.657
Why didn't we know about it?

51:34.658 --> 51:36.659
So where is it?

51:36.660 --> 51:41.660
Judging by the wirework,
it's up that direction,

51:41.765 --> 51:43.403
to the Happy Mansion

51:44.968 --> 51:46.311
"That" place?

51:48.905 --> 51:50.339
So, we're done?

51:50.340 --> 51:52.445
Let's go, get the stuff, hurry!

51:53.276 --> 51:57.012
Wait, you gotta come,
how do I know where to go?

51:57.013 --> 52:00.616
It's right there,
why should we go there?

52:00.617 --> 52:01.925
Hurry up!

52:13.029 --> 52:18.029
That area was abandoned
even before the redevelopment plan

52:18.735 --> 52:21.470
- Why?
- Because!

52:21.471 --> 52:23.041
It's haunted!

52:23.540 --> 52:24.848
Haunted?

52:25.509 --> 52:28.878
You don't believe me?
Go look at the mural

52:28.879 --> 52:30.415
Check it out

52:31.748 --> 52:33.284
Mural?

52:33.783 --> 52:36.957
Go see it for yourself!

52:38.522 --> 52:41.901
They erased it 'cos it's a bad omen,
but it's not all gone

52:42.759 --> 52:44.432
And the haunted pan?

52:45.395 --> 52:50.395
<i>One day, a girl drew a picture,</i>

52:51.301 --> 52:54.570
<i>then a kid really died
the way it was drawn</i>

52:54.571 --> 52:58.507
After that, there were rumors
that she was possessed,

52:58.508 --> 53:01.443
<i>that she talked to ghosts</i>

53:01.444 --> 53:02.978
<i>Then what?</i>

53:02.979 --> 53:06.282
<i>She was lynched by other kids,</i>

53:06.283 --> 53:11.053
<i>and the villagers went
nuts over her</i>

53:11.054 --> 53:15.391
<i>She started a fire
in the building and left</i>

53:15.392 --> 53:19.306
<i>Was her name Kang Ji-yun?</i>

53:21.464 --> 53:22.670
<i>No, it wasn't</i>

53:24.067 --> 53:29.380
<i>Her dad was an embalmer,
surname was Jo, I think</i>

53:30.407 --> 53:31.477
Boss!

53:32.475 --> 53:36.252
Like Young-su said, Jo Sun-ki
lived in that building

53:36.813 --> 53:38.981
And that runaway daughter...

53:38.982 --> 53:40.015
<i>Happy Mansion ♪301</i>

53:40.016 --> 53:41.750
she was reported missing

53:41.751 --> 53:42.685
<i>Jo Suh-hyun (B. '91, F)</i>

53:42.686 --> 53:43.926
Interesting thing is,

53:45.355 --> 53:47.656
Kang also lived there
around that time

53:47.657 --> 53:48.557
<i>Happy Mansion</i>

53:48.558 --> 53:49.366
<i>Kang Ji-yun</i>

53:50.060 --> 53:56.033
The victim, home address
All connected to Kang?

53:57.667 --> 53:59.468
- She's still in interrogation?
- Yes

53:59.469 --> 54:02.538
Tell Young-su to standby,
I'm on my way

54:02.539 --> 54:05.808
Well, he, uh,
Young-su...

54:05.809 --> 54:09.778
He rushed off to the hospital
with his wife...

54:09.779 --> 54:10.484
What?

54:11.448 --> 54:13.415
Should I get him?

54:13.416 --> 54:15.327
Right this second!

54:18.688 --> 54:21.290
We tracked down the IP

54:21.291 --> 54:21.991
Where?

54:21.992 --> 54:23.699
Happy Mansion in Jungreung

54:24.661 --> 54:27.870
Didn't you live there?

54:28.765 --> 54:29.865
Yes

54:29.866 --> 54:31.345
And...

54:32.902 --> 54:35.314
Recognize her?

54:50.687 --> 54:52.530
How did you know the kid?

54:53.323 --> 54:56.736
<i>It was 5 years ago,
before my debut</i>

55:06.870 --> 55:11.373
Style is not original,
but the story's the worst!

55:11.374 --> 55:14.443
Can't follow anything,
and so dull!

55:14.444 --> 55:16.390
Just give up!

55:16.846 --> 55:21.295
<i>Dozens of rejections, and
my efforts went to waste</i>

55:22.752 --> 55:25.321
<i>Money was drying up,
and I thought I was done,</i>

55:25.322 --> 55:27.289
<i>when I met her</i>

55:27.290 --> 55:29.270
Look at that crazy bitch!

55:29.492 --> 55:34.168
Don't mess with
the ghost talker!

55:34.331 --> 55:35.531
Move aside

55:35.532 --> 55:38.570
Don't mess with her!

55:39.469 --> 55:40.402
Crazy bitch!

55:40.403 --> 55:43.043
Think you're all that?

55:45.775 --> 55:46.583
Get back here!

55:49.446 --> 55:52.620
Goddammit!
Buncha thumb suckers!

55:53.850 --> 55:55.989
Hey, you okay?

55:58.421 --> 55:59.331
Kiddo!

56:01.591 --> 56:03.662
Stay here, I'll fetch some meds

56:27.684 --> 56:31.325
<i>Happy Birthday dear Suh-hyun,
Happy Birthday to you!</i>

56:55.278 --> 56:57.346
It's okay, Suh-hyun

56:57.347 --> 56:58.690
I'll protect you

56:59.849 --> 57:01.351
It's okay

57:01.951 --> 57:04.124
<i>That's how we began</i>

57:04.788 --> 57:07.735
Sharing feelings of abandonment

57:10.126 --> 57:12.970
Or bonding over
morbid drawing style

57:14.898 --> 57:15.968
No

57:16.666 --> 57:19.647
She didn't even want to
talk about the drawings

57:20.637 --> 57:24.744
What we needed
was companionship

57:31.314 --> 57:33.182
So why did she
start a fire and run away?

57:33.183 --> 57:36.096
That's a fabrication

57:36.820 --> 57:38.687
To kick us out

57:38.688 --> 57:40.756
My kid's dead
because of that witch!

57:40.757 --> 57:42.658
No! It wasn't me...

57:42.659 --> 57:43.926
Get back inside!

57:43.927 --> 57:45.294
I really didn't do...

57:45.295 --> 57:46.395
It's that bitch!

57:46.396 --> 57:47.696
Don't!

57:47.697 --> 57:48.675
You killed her!

57:49.866 --> 57:51.971
Stop it! Don't do this!

57:53.903 --> 57:56.772
You should die too!
You better!

57:56.773 --> 57:58.616
Bring my baby back!

57:59.309 --> 58:00.720
Get out!

58:03.680 --> 58:06.181
These two really are mad!

58:06.182 --> 58:11.153
The kid was run over by a truck,
like in her drawing!

58:11.154 --> 58:13.755
She's possessed!

58:13.756 --> 58:15.791
What the fuck!
Stab me, go on!

58:15.792 --> 58:17.703
Come on, man!

58:23.633 --> 58:24.771
Possessed?

58:26.002 --> 58:29.638
Afraid that you'll
share the same fate?

58:29.639 --> 58:31.312
Crazy fucks!

58:32.108 --> 58:33.909
<i>Crazy'?</i>

58:33.910 --> 58:37.746
Shall we find out
who's the crazy one?

58:37.747 --> 58:40.749
Dunno who gave you permission
to set up shop here,

58:40.750 --> 58:44.887
but if you don't leave
I'll burn this place down!

58:44.888 --> 58:45.721
Let's leave

58:45.722 --> 58:47.723
Shit! Dammit!

58:47.724 --> 58:50.261
My daughter!
Bring her back!

59:16.819 --> 59:17.986
Stop that!

59:17.987 --> 59:19.227
What? What? What?

59:23.893 --> 59:25.372
I said stop!

59:32.201 --> 59:33.976
Drink up!

59:34.671 --> 59:36.776
I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!

59:45.315 --> 59:49.627
A few days later,
there was a fire

59:51.287 --> 59:53.927
<i>The day I won the contest...</i>

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.303
It was arson,

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:09.241
and because she wasn't around,
people blamed her for it

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.812
That was the end of us

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.768
Look at that

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.754
But, how?

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.723
Yeah, combine the Su-hyun
case with ours

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:04.393
it looked like
she squatted there

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.663
And request forensics
for tomorrow

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.870
And Young-su?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.668
Tell him to take
his paternity leave

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.302
He'll know what it means

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.180
Okay, good work

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:23.712
You really think it's her?

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:27.126
The comic was a forgery

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:31.787
Came from an e-mail,
and that brought us here

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.889
And the image on the monitor,

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.224
you confirmed
it was drawn by her

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:39.761
- She just drew...
- Ms. Kang!

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:43.198
Do you accept that
people die like the comics?

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:47.769
You say murdered by ghosts,
I say a human,

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:52.310
regardless, Suh-hyun is
the source of all this

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.677
She has no reason to kill

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.954
Mr. Jo, the deceased,

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:02.219
was once reported for
child abuse

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:06.159
And the editor-in-chief...

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.192
we'll ask when we catch her

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.298
But my biggest question is,

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:18.076
why she's making you
draw the comic

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:33.387
How much?

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.083
$12 please

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.119
I see

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.532
<i>Been a while, come to
the building yard? Suh-hyun</i>

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.603
- Thank you
- Good bye

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.071
What is it?

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.048
Got a call from Suh-hyun?

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.686
Huh?

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:04.251
What's with the shock
on your face?

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.086
My smokes...

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.344
What are you doing?

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.407
Open this door!
Kang Ji-yun!

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:30.973
Hey!

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.121
Are you nuts?!

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.612
Open the door!

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.428
Kang Ji-yun!
Stop right there!

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.556
Stop!

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.235
Triangulate Kang's
cell phone, now!

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.047
Suh-hyun?

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.655
Suh-hyun?

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.990
Suh-hyun

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.575
Suh-hyun?

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.622
<i>Been a while, come to...</i>

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:04.928
Suh-hyun

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.571
Suh-hyun

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:35.390
- <i>Yes, boss
- Where you at?!</i>

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:40.391
My wife... had a checkup
because of an irregularity...

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.964
So what, shithead!

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:45.133
It's her first pregnancy, so...

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.969
Forget it, we're fucked

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:48.636
What?

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.572
Kang took off!

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:51.373
Seriously?

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.241
She may be an accomplice

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.010
How did that happen?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.685
<i>I got out of the car
to get smokes</i>

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.982
<i>In front of the restaurant?</i>

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:03.251
Yeah, anyway,

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:06.021
I'm sorry to say,
but I need you to come in

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.456
We'll be made men
once this case is solved

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.027
<i>I'm at the hospital...</i>

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:18.100
<i>How did that happen?
In front of the restaurant?</i>

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.799
Ms. Kang

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.473
Where's Suh-hyun?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.736
I don't know

01:08:28.737 --> 01:08:31.106
- Really?
- Yes

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.774
You didn't hide her?

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.448
I only know she went missing

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:37.651
Missing...

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:51.126
Didn't you draw this with her?

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.401
No, I didn't

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.100
So how did you know?

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.082
It's been 6 years

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:12.787
Help me

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.523
Mister

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:24.091
Take my hand

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.834
Help me

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.042
It hurts

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.774
Help me, please

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:41.515
Hold on, I'll get you out

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:49.484
<i>Honey! Dad approved!</i>

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:52.466
<i>We can get married!</i>

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.503
<i>I'm so happy!
I can't believe it!</i>

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:59.494
<i>Are you happy</i>

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:00.094
Yeah

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.507
<i>Honey, something wrong?</i>

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:05.071
It's nothing

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:08.536
<i>All right, what do we do first?</i>

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.642
<i>Let's lock down the date!</i>

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:15.884
<i>Honey! I'm so happy,
I can't breathe!</i>

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.397
Help me

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:43.712
Shit

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.114
It wasn't on purpose

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.322
Isn't it her fault
for being there?

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.653
Why is it my fault?

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:04.366
Why should my life end
even before it starts over this?

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:15.714
How you two found out
is not important

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:21.009
But it's important to
seal it forever

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.387
Don't kill me

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:32.389
Don't kill you?

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.525
What about me then?

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.395
What if it gets out?

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.568
Fuck that

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.476
And my unborn daughter?!

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:04.352
Saw a ghost when Jo died?

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.800
Crazy bitch, ghosts don't exist

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.401
<i>Help me</i>

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.873
<i>Help me</i>

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:26.352
<i>Help me, mister</i>

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:17.725
Stay back!

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:18.898
Get away!

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.402
Ms. Kang

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.474
Ms. Kang, wake up...

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.014
Boss...

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.667
Are you nuts?

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:29.697
Help me, boss

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:32.372
Lower your gun first

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.140
This isn't me...

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.848
What the hell are you saying!

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:45.246
I told you we shouldn't have
gotten involved!

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:49.684
Okay, let's drop the case

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:54.031
The case is closed,
so lower your gun

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.839
<i>Mi-jin...</i>

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.438
ghost...

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:10.850
Young-su...

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.974
Help me

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:16.210
It's my fault

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:17.745
Boss...

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.089
Think about your child

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.116
Your unborn child!

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.791
My baby...

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:26.824
Young-su

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.258
Det. Kim's gun from the scene

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:21.084
He kidnapped the suspect
who fled from you?

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:24.011
Yes

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:27.255
And you got here
by tracking him down?

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.317
Yes

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:32.788
But he shot himself
when you showed up?

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:37.892
It's... not suicide

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:39.060
- What?
- Chief!

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:41.028
- Chief, any statement?
- Will you open the scene?

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.804
- Take care of it
- Okay

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.012
We'll make a statement soon

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.282
Snap out of it, asshole!

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:53.874
You'll drag me down with you

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:57.118
These were all suicides

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.254
Got it?

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:03.951
He had a child on the way,
and he kills himself?

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.659
Son of a bitch!

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:14.840
You said you heard
gunshots, right?

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.799
About 3 shots

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.738
Idiot, he only fired
one shot, that's it!

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:28.175
The rest were still
in the magazine!

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:31.919
Young-su... said...

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.285
- a ghost...
- Shut up!

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:41.291
Are you nuts?
So a ghost killed a cop?

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:45.292
Listen to me,
logically speaking,

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.863
you're the primary suspect
in this case!

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.104
Got that?

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:55.978
Our heads will roll
if you keep this ghost shit up!

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.341
Dumbass...

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:08.215
You keep your mouth shut!

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:11.322
Young-su killed himself

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:24.365
We'll put you in
protective custody

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:28.135
Until the case is over,
do not talk to the media

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:30.404
Did you find Suh-hyun?

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:34.241
An APB is out on her
We'll hear something soon

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.188
- Take her home
- Yes, sir

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:46.966
Det. Choi, let's go

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:27.830
Boss

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.769
Yeah?

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.670
I found something weird
at the crime scene

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.079
What is it?

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:47.853
While searching Kang's home,
Young-su was interested in this

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.855
<i>Mi-jin</i>

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:57.862
Ghost...

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:00.735
<i>Mi-jin...</i>

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.114
Boss, should I look into this too?

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.007
What is it?

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:16.343
If Suh was killed
like in the comic,

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.345
maybe there are other cases

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.079
Ow!

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.049
Useless prick,
do your fucking job

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.791
That desperate to slack off?

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.446
<i>15-ton truck runs over girl,
cause unknown</i>

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.859
<i>It's green light,
please cross the street</i>

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.959
<i>2007, Unsolved cases</i>

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.104
<i>Head of mental institution
found dead in bathtub</i>

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:10.231
<i>Lawyer found dead,
no clear motive</i>

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:14.101
<i>Shocking past and truth!
Vengeful ghost comes with a story</i>

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:16.013
<i>Kang Ji-yun</i>

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.371
<i>New e-mail</i>

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:13.861
<i>My drawings...</i>

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:16.706
they're stories of dead people

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:23.145
After mom's death,
I was surrounded by corpses

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:27.544
<i>Dad said I reminded him of mom</i>

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:31.054
Get in there

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.087
Don't come out

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.061
You remind me of your mother

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.022
<i>What do you want me to do?!</i>

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:45.661
<i>I did all I could!
I did my best!</i>

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:17.628
<i>That's when I started
hearing the dead</i>

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:22.633
<i>I never wanted any</i>

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.342
Stop, Suh-hyun, enough

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.985
It'll be okay, I promise

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.772
The drawings are great

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:09.518
But story is the best,
it feels so alive

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.218
This really is yours?

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.523
Of course

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.367
I'm very confident
about the story

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.060
Where's Kang, asshole?!

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:29.563
It was an emergency,
I had to use the toilet...

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.134
Goddamn fuck!

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.037
What's this?

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:40.074
<i>Congrats,
publication date is out</i>

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:41.508
<i>Seriously?</i>

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:44.144
<i>The title's “History of Lunacy“
Like it?</i>

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.079
Of course!

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.614
I'll come by tomorrow
with the manuscript

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:51.529
Thank you, thank you so much

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.010
I'll burn them all!

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.072
Don't you dare take it outside!

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.577
Only as a reference?

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.081
Really?

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:53.680
You can't publish this!

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:55.558
They're stories of the dead!

01:25:56.551 --> 01:26:00.254
My manuscript...

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:02.496
What are you doing?! Stop!

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:04.796
Let me go

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.003
My manuscript...

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.703
is burning

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:13.840
No, those aren't yours!

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:19.711
No! They're mine!

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:23.511
Mine!

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.555
All mine

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.560
Ji-yun

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:33.655
No!

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:02.924
You can't...

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:31.214
Please...

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:38.854
Suh-hyun

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:41.589
Suh-hyun

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.635
Suh-hyun...

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:51.536
I won the comic contest

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.901
Now we can live happily

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:58.739
That's why I need this

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.141
The dead, the dead!

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:04.988
I'll put these outside
and come back

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:07.784
No!

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:11.952
You know the dead
are killing people

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.821
Who cares who gets killed

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:17.063
We're not the ones
killing them!

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:23.502
You understand me, right?

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:28.669
I'll be right back

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:32.005
I'll come back, okay?

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.144
Ji-yun!

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:55.162
Mine!

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.972
They're mine!

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:05.512
No amount of effort
does a thing,

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.648
but it just happens for you

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:17.727
Why must you waste your talent?

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.998
Are you nuts?

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:25.162
Then just give me that gift

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:35.061
I'm the one...
who needs their stories

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:40.678
Suh-hyun... I want it...

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:39.900
Ji-yun, what happened?

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.507
Where's Suh-hyun?
Where is she?

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:47.678
I didn't see her today

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.090
Anything from
the basement sweep?

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:06.259
<i>I got the results,
but it's weird</i>

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:09.062
<i>Aside from your prints,
only Kang's showed up</i>

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.897
<i>Not</i> a <i>single one of
Suh-hyun</i> S <i>prints</i>

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:12.699
Fuck, I knew it

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:13.834
<i>Sir?</i>

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:17.571
Suh-hyun is dead

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:19.552
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.553
I'm sorry

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:44.959
As with "History of Lunacy"
this new book is also a hit

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:48.393
I've been wondering
while reading,

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:52.662
do you believe in ghosts?

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.695
- Ghosts?
- Yes

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:59.838
I actually... don't

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.876
You don't believe in ghosts?

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:09.643
I tell stories of ghosts,
but to be precise,

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:14.247
I used ghosts as a metaphor
to express the dark secrets

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.854
that we all have inside of us

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:25.094
From petty mistakes
to grave wrongdoings,

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.698
we all live with guilt
in ourlives

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:39.015
Don't we all have at least one of
these stories in us?

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:32.927
Kang Ji-yun

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.464
You killed them all!

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.599
No

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:41.141
Why do you think
they were suicides?

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:51.285
Because of those who care
for nothing but greed,

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:54.914
the dead wanted me

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:58.184
No, you wanted them

01:35:58.185 --> 01:36:02.156
That's why
you killed Suh-hyun

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:18.442
It's all because of your greed

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:24.286
- Greed?
- Yes!

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.892
That thirst for avarice!

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:32.553
Yeah?

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:38.495
You're any different?

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:39.836
What?

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.231
Help me...

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:18.867
You moron!

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:20.567
You wanna die?

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:21.467
Is that it?!

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.879
You think this is...

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:18.959
No

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.895
No

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:23.933
It was an accident

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:26.868
At the time...

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:31.414
That's not the truth

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:35.954
No! No!

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:42.586
I will kill you!

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.189
Young-su...

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.163
Young-su...
