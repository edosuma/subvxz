WEBVTT

00:13.458 --> 00:15.542
(male #1)
'Shake it, baby.'

00:15.625 --> 00:17.500
I just finished reading
"The Feminine Mystique"

00:17.583 --> 00:19.250
and I don't get it, Alison.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.250
I mean, I'm not
some kind of man-hater.

00:21.333 --> 00:23.500
[scoffs]
'Cause there's so much to
love.

00:27.333 --> 00:31.041
I mean, I'm proud,
being a housewife, a
mother.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.375
I don't hate my life.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.291
Well, hating your
life
isn't Betty's
point.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.583
Then what is?

00:35.667 --> 00:36.917
Loving it.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.125
Do you love your life, Libby?

00:40.166 --> 00:42.125
Last chance, macho men.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.792
If your keys aren't in the
bowl,
I can't pick 'em!

00:45.875 --> 00:47.542
(male #1)
'Whoo! You heard my wife!'

00:47.625 --> 00:50.166
Time to get real
free
and real naked!

00:51.667 --> 00:54.500
- That's women's lib for you.
- What's going on?

00:54.583 --> 00:56.083
Carl didn't tell you?

00:57.542 --> 00:59.083
It's a key party.

00:59.166 --> 01:02.125
(Alison)
'Everyone's doing it.'

01:02.208 --> 01:03.959
Not everyone.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.458
Carl, let's go.

01:09.542 --> 01:12.834
- What? We just got here.
- I wanna to go home.

01:12.917 --> 01:14.875
Loosen up, Lib.
Get yourself a drink.

01:14.959 --> 01:17.625
You knew about
this, didn't you?

01:18.959 --> 01:20.959
I promised Joe I'd play.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.041
It's something he heard about
when he was in California.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.208
We live in Pennsylvania.

01:25.291 --> 01:26.834
It's just a game, Lib.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.625
When Joe got home
he left his wife

01:28.709 --> 01:30.667
for a 23-year-old stewardess.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.333
It's not just a game.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.500
Take a cab, then. I'm staying.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.417
God knows it's been
a frigid winter.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.166
(female #1)
'Let's go, foxy ladies.'

01:43.250 --> 01:44.834
You pick his keychain

01:44.917 --> 01:48.083
and he sticks his keys
in your ignition.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.500
Who's gonna kick things off?

01:56.542 --> 01:57.875
I will.

01:59.583 --> 02:02.458
- Libby?
- I said, I will.

02:17.959 --> 02:20.542
Who's the...lucky macho man?

02:33.583 --> 02:36.709
(female #2)
'Mom?'

02:36.792 --> 02:37.709
Mom!

02:37.792 --> 02:38.792
I hate this part.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.250
'Mom! Mommy!'

02:41.333 --> 02:43.542
[sobbing]
Mom! Oh! Mom!

02:43.625 --> 02:45.375
Young lady, you're gonna
have to step back.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.583
[sobbing]
Oh, my God!

02:47.667 --> 02:50.208
- Breathe.
- Ah, that's my mom.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.417
- Breathe.
- Oh..

02:54.500 --> 02:56.291
Breathe. Just breathe.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.667
Just breathe.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.250
You're going to be alright.

03:04.125 --> 03:07.542
We'll find the person
who did this.

03:07.625 --> 03:08.875
You will?

03:10.041 --> 03:11.291
Yeah.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.291
I promise.

03:49.875 --> 03:51.458
Got here fast
as we could, Will.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.834
(Nick)
Missing my beauty sleep.
Better be good.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.125
Kids camping out

03:55.208 --> 03:58.125
having some
sort of Blair Witch
scarefest.

03:58.208 --> 04:01.000
- Making a movie?
- Looking for a ghost.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.542
As in, Casper the Friendly?

04:02.625 --> 04:04.333
Libby Bradley.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.375
Found stabbed
in these woods, 1979.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.959
Kids been calling the place..

04:08.041 --> 04:09.250
'...haunted ever since.'

04:09.333 --> 04:10.375
What'd they find?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.417
Ski jacket
stuffed in a tree trunk.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.792
(Will)
'Doer must've dumped it.'

04:13.875 --> 04:16.000
Amount of blood
looks like a stabbing.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.208
From...27 years ago.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.417
Half mile
from where we found her.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
'A few hundred yards
beyond our search area.'

04:23.083 --> 04:24.583
Called her daughter to ID it.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.542
You called a family member
at 2:00 a.m. over a jacket?

04:27.625 --> 04:30.792
She's been calling me
for 27 years.

04:30.875 --> 04:33.166
You worked the job
back in '79?

04:33.250 --> 04:35.667
And made a promise
I couldn't keep.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.166
Rookie mistake.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.583
(female #2)
'Will?'

04:43.583 --> 04:45.000
(Will)
'Helen.'

04:45.083 --> 04:47.625
Detectives Rush, Vera.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.000
You found something?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.291
Ski jacket.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.875
Thinking it might
be your mom's.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.125
Oh, my God.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.458
You recognize it?

05:01.542 --> 05:03.250
She used to call it
her bumblebee jacket

05:03.333 --> 05:05.542
because of the black stripe.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.041
Found this in the pocket.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.583
Car keys.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.041
That doesn't make sense.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.542
What doesn't?

05:14.625 --> 05:16.166
Those car keys couldn't be hers.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.458
Why not?

05:17.542 --> 05:19.542
Because my mother
didn't know how to
drive.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.250
(Scotty)
'Blood on the jacket's
O-positive'

05:57.333 --> 05:59.000
'same as Libby Bradley's.'

05:59.083 --> 06:01.875
(Will)
Best theory back in '79
was a mugging gone wrong.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.750
Lots of transients
in those woods back then.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.417
No signs of sexual assault?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.625
Nope. I always wondered why
she wasn't dressed for the
cold.

06:08.709 --> 06:09.792
(Will)
Dead of winter.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.250
Doer must have
lifted her
jacket.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.083
- Never found the murder weapon?
- Never ID'd it.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.291
Puncture wound
to the left lung.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.959
(Will)
'Drowned on her own blood.'

06:18.041 --> 06:20.291
Husband Carl and daughter
Helen were the last to see
her

06:20.375 --> 06:22.083
before they left
for work, school.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.291
Estimated time
of death, 2:00 p.m.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.000
Carl was at work all day.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.917
Alibi checked out.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.875
Real stand-up people.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.041
Every year, Helen sends me
a card on her mother's
birthday.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.917
Not this year.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.750
(Scotty)
'And it's tough to hold on'

06:38.834 --> 06:40.834
you know, keep believing.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.458
I never forgot.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.959
Checked with the manufacturer.

06:46.041 --> 06:48.917
Key was for
a '75 Cadillac Eldorado.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.417
Transients don't
drive Cadillacs.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.125
The doer was close to
home,
same social circle.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.208
Let's talk to the husband.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.875
Oh, and, uh, boss needs you.

07:08.959 --> 07:12.583
Scotty. Uh, ADA Thomas.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.500
Heard you on the stand
a few months back.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.000
Impressive.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.250
Thanks.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.000
So, what's up?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.667
My sole witness in the
Fitzpatrick molestation
trial

07:21.750 --> 07:23.375
committed suicide.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.333
Uh, you talking
about Jimmy Donohue?

07:26.417 --> 07:28.834
Yeah. You know him?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, old neighborhood.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.500
- Uh, when'd it happen?
- 'Last night.'

07:32.583 --> 07:34.875
He hung himself.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.959
You knew the guy.
Sorry. Don't pull punches.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.834
Don't need to.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.083
Bottom line, Scotty,
is Fitzpatrick's gonna walk.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.875
No one else is willing
to come forward.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.792
Unless your brother does.

07:47.792 --> 07:49.959
Already talked to him. No dice.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.125
- It's tough when it's
family.
- Your meaning?

07:53.208 --> 07:56.166
Seen you on the stand,
detective, working that magic.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.625
- Ain't my brother's keeper.
- But you are a cop, right?

08:05.458 --> 08:07.375
You know where you can reach me.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.750
Sure, Alex.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.417
We have new evidence
in your wife's murder, Carl.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.000
New evidence. Like what?

08:26.083 --> 08:29.166
Kids out in the woods
found her ski jacket.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.834
(Kat)
'Keys in the pocket.'

08:30.917 --> 08:32.166
For a Cadillac.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.834
Wondering if you might
know something about
it.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.333
Well, I, uh..

08:40.000 --> 08:41.417
I don't know what to say.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
Your daughter wants
answers.
I assume you do, too.

08:44.583 --> 08:48.000
You have to understand,
it was the '70s.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.375
(Kat)
'Okay.'

08:50.458 --> 08:51.750
We didn't always
behave like that.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.208
(Carl)
'We had families.'

08:54.291 --> 08:56.083
We were decent people.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.417
Talk about the key chain.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.000
[sighs]
Libby picked it.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.709
What do you mean...picked it?

09:04.792 --> 09:06.333
At a key party.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.083
Who's the lucky macho man?

09:12.375 --> 09:13.834
I guess that'd be me.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.709
(male #1)
'Far out!'

09:16.792 --> 09:18.000
Man of the house
goes home

09:18.083 --> 09:21.166
with the foxiest lady
at the party.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.458
Oh.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.625
Don't let me get
in the way, honey bunny.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.458
You pick now, hot pants.

09:27.542 --> 09:30.583
(male #1)
'I want to know who's
grooving in our pad tonight.'

09:30.667 --> 09:32.458
You sure about this, Libby?

09:32.542 --> 09:34.959
I-I think so.
I don't know.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.917
- Whoo!
- Those are mine!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.083
(Carl)
Those are mine.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.333
Whoo!

09:39.417 --> 09:41.458
You be easy on
my wife, macho man.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.375
Think you mean
your second wife.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.834
- I'll just get my coat.
- Oh.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.041
Hey, I thought
you were in bed.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.500
It's hard to sleep
in Studio 54.

09:59.583 --> 10:00.917
Hi, Mrs. Bradley.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.291
Hi, Jed.

10:03.375 --> 10:06.667
Oh, ready if you
are.
Night, son.

10:14.417 --> 10:15.500
(Kat)
So..

10:15.583 --> 10:18.250
...Libby and Bill left together.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.834
(Will)
'And two months
later, she's dead'

10:20.917 --> 10:23.583
with his keys
in her pocket.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.166
I started this.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.375
Taking her to that key party.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.542
Maybe Bill finished it.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.875
- 'Bill Huxley?'
- Son of a bitch!

10:45.959 --> 10:47.875
Detectives Rush, Vera.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.834
This is a members-only
establishment.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.125
So is police headquarters.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.917
How about
we chat down there instead?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.792
(Bill)
I'll catch up
on the next hole.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.792
You remember Libby Bradley..

10:58.875 --> 11:00.875
...stabbed in '79?

11:00.959 --> 11:02.417
That was a lifetime ago.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.875
(Nick)
'Maybe for you.'

11:03.959 --> 11:06.000
For some, still
feels like yesterday.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.500
Something going on
between you two?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.125
What? No.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.542
We just knew each other
from the neighborhood.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.834
What about that key party?

11:13.917 --> 11:16.291
- Oh, that.
<i>that.</i>

11:16.375 --> 11:18.417
- It was one night.
- 'Really?'

11:18.500 --> 11:19.709
Then why were your car keys

11:19.792 --> 11:22.291
in her pocket
the night she died?

11:22.375 --> 11:25.667
Maybe sitting in a cell for a
few hours will jog that
memory.

11:27.834 --> 11:31.417
She had my keys because it
wasn't just a one-night
stand.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.750
Go on.

11:33.917 --> 11:36.333
We had something special.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.250
I've never done this before.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.417
Don't tell anybody,
but neither have I.

11:47.834 --> 11:51.125
Well, I guess we should just,
you know, what Joe said..

11:52.709 --> 11:55.041
Take off our clothes.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.959
Right, right, okay.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.250
Wow, you look..

12:27.333 --> 12:29.667
You have a nice body.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.041
Thank you.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.333
What's wrong? You okay?

12:53.417 --> 12:55.417
I've been with Carl
since was I was 18.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.041
He's the only man
I've, I've ever..

12:59.125 --> 13:00.834
'...been with.'

13:00.917 --> 13:02.375
When everybody else
was going to Woodstock

13:02.458 --> 13:05.417
the whole
sexual
revolution
thing..

13:05.500 --> 13:06.750
...we were raising families.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.291
I got pregnant when I was 20.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.458
Yeah, same as Alison.

13:09.542 --> 13:10.792
Well, 21.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.542
Carl and I were just kids
when we met, I mean..

13:13.625 --> 13:16.041
We don't even have
anything in common anymore. I..

13:17.417 --> 13:20.500
Maybe that's
why he cheats on me.

13:22.250 --> 13:25.417
Alison and I haven't had sex
in over two and a half years.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.375
I'm sorry. I'm telling you
things you don't want to
hear.

13:30.458 --> 13:34.291
No, no, it's just I-I didn't
know that, that other people..

13:34.375 --> 13:35.625
Yeah.

13:37.166 --> 13:41.125
- Bill?
- Yes, Libby.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.333
You ever feel like..

13:43.417 --> 13:46.208
...we missed out on things?

13:46.291 --> 13:47.542
Maybe it's not too late.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.750
So how'd your wife feel
about your newfound soul
mate?

14:08.834 --> 14:11.166
What the hell am I
protecting her for?

14:11.250 --> 14:14.250
- We're divorced 25 years.
- Okay.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.875
After that key party..

14:15.959 --> 14:19.500
Alison took the angry,
cynical
thing to a whole new level.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.583
She became
downright
hostile.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.917
(Bill)
'That Cadillac was
the family car.'

14:24.000 --> 14:25.583
Alison drove it mostly.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.792
So the happy face keychain?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.542
Wasn't mine.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.500
It was hers.

14:41.625 --> 14:42.917
Alison Huxley?

14:45.542 --> 14:46.625
You're new here.

14:46.709 --> 14:49.041
I know just the class
to open up your chakras.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.667
My chakras can't wait.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.625
We're here
about Libby Bradley.

14:53.709 --> 14:56.291
Oh, real tragedy that.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.875
It threw all of
us
into a
tailspin.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.208
On the bright side,
it put an end

15:00.291 --> 15:01.959
to her affair
with your husband.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.458
I wasn't happy Libby
was banging my husband

15:06.542 --> 15:08.583
'but somebody had
to do it, right?'

15:08.667 --> 15:11.041
So...you knew about the affair?

15:11.125 --> 15:13.083
Maybe you helped
bring it to a close.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.792
I was too blitzed
to get out of bed

15:14.875 --> 15:17.333
in the morning,
never mind murder.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.667
Bill said you
were pretty
angry.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.917
Oh, and Bill's
still an idiot.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.583
I wasn't angry.
I was depressed.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.667
I was popping "Mother's
Little
Helpers" by the fistful.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.792
- Self-medicating.
- Bingo.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.500
No one ever talked
about depression back
then.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.959
We were just bored housewives.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.667
So...why'd Libby
have your car keys?

15:36.750 --> 15:38.291
Don't ask me.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.792
I wasn't the
one
driving that
boat.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.625
You are a stone fox.

15:48.709 --> 15:50.792
Think we can sneak
out of here?

15:50.875 --> 15:54.417
Okay. Julie and I have
an announcement to make.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.917
- 'Hot stuff?'
- You say it, Joey baby.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.125
You're so dynamite with words.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.083
The key party
was, like, the coolest

16:02.166 --> 16:04.709
most far out thing
that ever happened to us.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.041
(Julie)
'Right on.'

16:06.125 --> 16:07.208
(Joe)
'We don't need a game'

16:07.291 --> 16:08.709
'to do what comes naturally.'

16:08.792 --> 16:11.000
We've decided to have
an open marriage.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.458
Pigs in a blanket? Anyone?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.750
They're from a box.
My mom's specialty.

16:17.834 --> 16:21.542
Helen, please.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.542
We're totally into it and we
think you guys should be, too.

16:24.625 --> 16:28.208
Our egos are liberated
from our fear..

16:28.291 --> 16:29.750
...of our own id.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.083
[scoffs]
Geez.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.875
What the hell
are you people talking about?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.250
Means Mr. Puka Beads here

16:34.333 --> 16:35.834
'gets to dip his fondue fork'

16:35.917 --> 16:37.041
in all our pots.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.542
Jed, pour me another.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.709
Wow, mom, you actually
remember my name.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.166
Well, that's one
way
to put it, Alison.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.583
But yeah, sure.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.083
- I can dig it.
- Maybe we should give it a
try.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.166
How about you ease up
on those martinis?

16:51.250 --> 16:52.291
How about we quit
pretending like

16:52.375 --> 16:54.458
our marriages mean anything?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.375
That's the attitude
I'm talking about.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.834
Oh.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.709
You know, maybe I have had
a little too much to drink.

17:00.792 --> 17:03.709
(Libby)
'I should go. I'm really
not feeling too hot.'

17:03.792 --> 17:05.083
You look fine to me.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.375
Way too hot
for a fifth grade teacher.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.417
Why don't you stick around?

17:08.500 --> 17:09.667
Oh, I think I'll be fine

17:09.750 --> 17:11.291
once I've had
a good night's sleep.

17:11.375 --> 17:14.166
Hey, Jed, why don't you give
her
a ride home, buddy, would you?

17:21.542 --> 17:24.000
More cheese for the rest of us.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.291
Last time I saw those keys..

17:26.375 --> 17:28.166
...the night my
hubby
recruited our son

17:28.250 --> 17:29.375
to help with his affair.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.875
Help with his affair?

17:30.959 --> 17:33.333
The whole
I'm-not-feeling-well
routine was a ruse

17:33.417 --> 17:36.208
for them to meet while
the rest of us got hammered.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.041
Jed was their
personal chauffeur.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.125
- You're kidding.
- 'Wish I were.'

17:40.208 --> 17:42.333
My son was
an innocent
bystander.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.792
How'd you find out
about this arrangement?

17:44.875 --> 17:47.458
Well, I was
drugged,
not brain-dead.

17:47.542 --> 17:48.834
(Alison)
'Ask Jed.'

17:48.917 --> 17:52.125
His memory was
a lot better than
mine.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.625
(John)
'Chauffeuring your
father's mistress'

17:59.709 --> 18:02.375
not exactly
an ideal
childhood.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.333
Whose was?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.834
Got a point there.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.667
Still, not many
fathers
asking their kids

18:08.750 --> 18:11.125
to get involved like that.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.750
(Lilly)
'Make you upset?'

18:12.834 --> 18:15.000
Your dad running
around like that?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.792
I was a lonely kid.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.000
Sort of caught in nowhere land.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.583
- Meaning?
- I was happy to do it.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.834
Because I got
something out of it, too.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.917
- What's that?
- A friend.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.250
- You know, Mrs. Bradley..
- Oh, it's Libby.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.000
Please, I'm not that ancient.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.625
You were like my favorite
teacher in fifth grade.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.834
All that stuff you
taught
us about astronomy?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.500
I'm, I'm totally into it now.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.041
Well, that's nice, Jed.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.250
'There's so much
going on out there.'

18:51.333 --> 18:54.083
'The universe is expanding.'

18:54.166 --> 18:56.625
Here it's just..

18:56.709 --> 18:58.542
It's always the same.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.834
Ah, here's not that bad.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.417
'Yeah.'

19:02.500 --> 19:04.917
It kind of is.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.542
Now you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.709
'You can do anything
that you want.'

19:10.458 --> 19:13.000
Just don't wait
until it's too late, okay?

19:14.458 --> 19:15.709
Like you did?

19:17.083 --> 19:19.583
Yeah. Right.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.792
There's an eclipse coming.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.083
That's right.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.375
They say it's like
once-in-a-lifetime.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.250
Ah, true. It is beautiful.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.250
But you can't
even look at them.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.417
You'll go blind.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.125
Ah, you can
with a pinhole camera.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.417
Oh, yeah.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.166
You showed us in class.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.792
Mine fell apart.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.834
How about I help you
make a new one?

19:54.750 --> 19:56.083
Okay.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.542
Thanks.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.250
Um, and I
can teach you

19:59.333 --> 20:01.625
to drive if you want.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.458
About time I learned.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.542
Oh, here, um..

20:05.625 --> 20:07.583
Take your own set.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.208
You planning to walk home?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.375
Oh, no, I..

20:11.458 --> 20:13.000
...I got a spare.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.625
Um, you know, Mrs. Bradley..

20:16.709 --> 20:18.083
Libby.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.875
Oh.

20:19.959 --> 20:22.041
I know about
you and my dad.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.250
- Jed.
- No, no, it's cool.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.875
Really, because..

20:26.959 --> 20:28.375
...he and my mom..

20:28.458 --> 20:30.709
...don't really talk.

20:30.792 --> 20:34.083
Your dad's
a special kind of guy.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.625
- Once-in-a-lifetime?
- Yeah.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.291
See you soon, Jed.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.625
Bye.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.625
Once a week,
I'd take her driving

20:51.709 --> 20:53.875
and we'd talk about astronomy.

20:53.959 --> 20:56.083
- Got close.
- 'Jed.'

20:56.166 --> 20:58.583
Libby ever mention someone
she might have been afraid of?

20:59.917 --> 21:03.583
You know, a few times
after our lessons

21:03.667 --> 21:07.875
I'd drop her at her house
and he'd be waiting.

21:07.959 --> 21:09.792
Who?

21:09.875 --> 21:11.667
Joe Livingston.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.291
Dr. Free Love
was hot for
Libby?

21:14.375 --> 21:15.583
Seemed that way.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.250
Always there
when Mr. Bradley wasn't around.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.875
Never thought to
mention
that back in '79?

21:20.959 --> 21:25.083
Uh, everyone said
it was a homeless person.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.458
Right?

21:41.792 --> 21:43.083
(Mike)
Scotty.

21:44.792 --> 21:47.375
Since when do you smoke?

21:49.875 --> 21:51.875
Bad habit, huh?

21:51.959 --> 21:54.083
What are you doing here?

21:54.166 --> 21:57.000
Something came up.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.250
Something like what?

21:58.333 --> 21:59.709
With that
Coach Fitzpatrick thing.

21:59.792 --> 22:00.875
What the hell is
wrong
with you, Scotty?

22:00.959 --> 22:02.166
- Just listen.
- No. No.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.500
I told you I've
got nothing to
do--

22:03.583 --> 22:05.834
Jimmy Donohue
killed himself.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.417
What?

22:10.792 --> 22:14.542
- You gotta tell 'em, Mike.
- I'm going inside.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.834
Hey, you're on
the same road as Jimmy

22:15.917 --> 22:17.000
unless you say something.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.542
Get off of me.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.417
- I know what happened.
- You shut up.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
You didn't come home.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.417
- So I went to the gym.
- Shut up!

22:28.500 --> 22:29.667
You always came home at 6:00.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.333
- So I went to find you.
- I swear to God.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.083
- You don't shut your mouth--
- I saw you in his office.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.417
- You don't know what you saw.
- I saw what he was doing!

22:35.500 --> 22:36.709
[grunts]
Shut up!

22:36.792 --> 22:38.959
I saw what Coach
Fitz
was doing to you.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.792
Shut up!

22:40.875 --> 22:43.375
I never told no one.

22:43.458 --> 22:46.500
I...I let you down, Mike.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.625
I'm sorry.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.583
Heard you were a real
free-love, swinger-type,
Joe.

23:10.667 --> 23:11.750
Still am.

23:11.834 --> 23:12.959
Also heard
you were trying to get in

23:13.041 --> 23:14.625
Libby Bradley's bell bottoms.

23:14.709 --> 23:15.917
Come again?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.291
Why else camp out
on her doorstep
24/7?

23:18.375 --> 23:19.625
She was a foxy lady.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.166
I wanted a piece of the pie.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.834
Can you blame me?

23:22.917 --> 23:24.750
And when she told you
to take your Puka
beads

23:24.834 --> 23:26.625
and shove 'em,
maybe you killed
her.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.417
Lots of fish in
the sea back then.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.750
- Now, too.
- Not much of an alibi, Joe.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.959
The day Libby
was killed, Julie and I

23:35.041 --> 23:37.125
were joining the Mile-High Club

23:37.208 --> 23:39.166
'first class to Waikiki.'

23:39.250 --> 23:40.709
I'll check that out.

23:42.291 --> 23:43.917
Bottom line..

23:44.000 --> 23:45.291
...Libby turned me down

23:45.375 --> 23:47.375
I moved on to greener pastures.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.792
- 'Too bad she couldn't.'
- What do you mean?

23:49.875 --> 23:51.625
Took her little affair
too seriously.

23:51.709 --> 23:53.542
She thought Bill was the answer.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.083
I'm guessing he wasn't.

23:55.166 --> 23:58.583
She found out the hard way
at Helen's Sweet 16 party.

24:11.959 --> 24:14.333
And at our next lesson, I'll
teach you how to parallel
park.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.375
My dad, he's just...
he doesn't mean it.'

24:33.375 --> 24:34.417
Dance with me?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.709
Just stop, would ya?

24:36.792 --> 24:39.458
- 'What's wrong?'
- 'You're crowding me,
Libby.'

24:39.542 --> 24:40.834
(Bill)
'Let me breathe.'

24:40.917 --> 24:42.333
You said that we
had something special.

24:42.417 --> 24:43.625
Yeah, yeah, we did.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.625
- "Did?"
- I wanted to have fun.

24:46.709 --> 24:49.333
But now you're
just suffocating
me.

24:49.417 --> 24:54.000
- I thought what we had was..
- Was...what, Libby?

24:55.792 --> 24:58.750
Once in a lifetime.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.875
If you were going
to fall in love..

25:00.959 --> 25:04.291
...I never would've
climbed into the
bed.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.000
Oh.

25:06.083 --> 25:10.000
(Bill)
'I don't want another wife.'

25:10.083 --> 25:12.166
Sorry.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.083
Mom.

25:44.875 --> 25:48.375
♪ I'm making' it ♪
Woo woo woo

26:08.041 --> 26:09.959
You okay?

26:10.041 --> 26:11.959
- What the hell is your
problem?
- Leave me alone.

26:12.041 --> 26:13.625
You're embarrassing me,
acting like a fool.

26:13.709 --> 26:14.917
You're the one
that started all of
this

26:15.000 --> 26:16.166
wanting to spice up
the marriage.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.709
- Well, now I don't.
- Too late.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.291
- Shut up. We're going home.
- Take it easy, man.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.583
- You're hurting her.
- It's too late to go home.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.291
I told you
to shut up! Let's go!

26:29.625 --> 26:32.000
So Carl wanted to go
back to the way it was.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.834
(Joe)
'It was too late.'

26:33.917 --> 26:35.583
Genie was already
out of the bottle.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.667
'I'd never seen him
lose his cool like that.'

26:38.750 --> 26:40.083
When was this party?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.417
The night before
Libby was killed.

26:45.917 --> 26:49.250
(Scotty)
'Real ugly fight...night of
your daughter's party.'

26:49.333 --> 26:50.959
Night before
your wife died, in fact.

26:51.041 --> 26:54.333
You couldn't control her
anymore and you like control.

26:54.417 --> 26:55.834
(Scotty)
'Don't you, Carl?'

26:55.917 --> 26:58.375
It doesn't mean
that I killed Libby.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.834
Lot of times
that's how it happens.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.208
Wife changes on you,
you go nuts.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.083
I did not kill my wife!

27:04.166 --> 27:05.875
Never heard that before.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.500
(Carl)
'I told you.'

27:07.583 --> 27:09.208
I was at work all day.

27:09.291 --> 27:10.917
Three-martini
lunches back
then.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.875
Plenty of time
to duck out and do murder.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.125
Libby wanted a divorce..

27:17.208 --> 27:19.041
...and I didn't.

27:19.125 --> 27:21.250
Never mentioned
that back in the day.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.000
'Well, I knew
how it would look.'

27:23.083 --> 27:25.542
It would've put a serious crack
in that perfect image of yours.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.041
Big house. Beautiful wife.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.959
(Nick)
'Not to mention
a motive for murder.'

27:29.041 --> 27:30.959
I tried to talk her out of it.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.834
Till I saw the damage
we were doing.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.041
The person who
was suffering the most.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.208
Who was that?

27:40.291 --> 27:41.583
Our daughter.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.750
We're not going
to make it, Carl.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.583
You don't just walk
out on a marriage.

27:51.667 --> 27:52.917
Why?

27:54.667 --> 27:56.542
It's not what people do.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.917
I've been doing what
people told me my whole life.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.291
I'm sick of it.

28:04.375 --> 28:05.750
(Carl)
'We built a life together.'

28:05.834 --> 28:07.417
No, you built it, Carl.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.083
I was just along
for the ride.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.917
You're leaving me for Bill?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.041
No, this has nothing
to do with him.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.417
Not anymore.

28:18.834 --> 28:21.583
I've always been
scared to be alone..

28:24.500 --> 28:26.583
...but maybe not anymore.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.917
Maybe we can both
make it on our own.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.125
See what you did?

28:45.208 --> 28:48.291
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.417
(Helen)
'You humiliated me.'

28:50.500 --> 28:51.792
In front of the whole world!

28:51.875 --> 28:53.250
What the hell were
you trying to do?

28:53.333 --> 28:55.792
I hate my life!
I hate both of you!

28:55.875 --> 28:57.709
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

28:57.792 --> 28:59.834
- 'Helen, enough!'
- Give me your hand!

28:59.917 --> 29:02.625
You're sleeping
with our neighbors.

29:02.709 --> 29:03.792
You're a joke,
you know that?

29:03.875 --> 29:04.959
Just a common whore!

29:05.041 --> 29:08.208
- Helen, please.
- Don't touch me!

29:08.291 --> 29:09.583
You come near me
and I swear to God

29:09.667 --> 29:11.333
- I will kill you!
- Helen, put that down.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.834
I swear to God!

29:13.917 --> 29:15.250
[sobbing]
I will.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.125
(Nick)
'No suicide attempt
on record.'

29:25.291 --> 29:26.959
It was a family secret.

29:27.041 --> 29:29.208
Now Helen picked up an ice pick?

29:29.291 --> 29:31.041
Yeah. Why?

29:31.125 --> 29:32.583
Could've caused
a puncture wound.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.834
(Scotty)
'Probably didn't go
to school the next day.'

29:34.917 --> 29:36.041
Of course she did.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.041
After a traumatic
night like that?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.834
Wha, what exactly
are you implying?

29:41.917 --> 29:44.875
Your daughter was home
the day Libby was murdered.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.417
That's crazy.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.542
Explains why she's been
hounding us all these years.

29:49.625 --> 29:52.250
Maybe she was looking
to get caught.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.375
We spoke to your father, Helen.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.333
Know about your suicide attempt.

30:00.417 --> 30:01.709
And the fight with your mom.

30:01.792 --> 30:04.792
Night before she was killed.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.041
What are you saying?

30:06.125 --> 30:07.625
(Lilly)
'Your mother embarrassed you'

30:07.709 --> 30:09.834
in front of all your friends.

30:09.917 --> 30:11.500
Bad enough you wanted to die.

30:11.583 --> 30:14.333
(Will)
'That state of mind
make you do crazy things.'

30:15.625 --> 30:18.875
You should have told me, Helen.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.250
I couldn't.

30:21.417 --> 30:23.333
I was so ashamed.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.542
(Helen)
The day after the
party

30:27.625 --> 30:29.500
we were in the
house
together alone..

30:29.583 --> 30:31.500
...my mom and me.

30:31.583 --> 30:32.834
Go on.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.875
She tried to talk to me.

30:37.667 --> 30:40.333
And I just pushed her away.

30:40.417 --> 30:44.041
When all she wanted to do
was make things right.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.250
We need to talk
about last night, Helen.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.917
I don't want to talk to you.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.250
How about I talk?

31:20.083 --> 31:21.542
You just listen.

31:21.625 --> 31:22.834
Okay?

31:26.083 --> 31:29.250
I'm sorry for how I've
acted
these last few months.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.333
I haven't been much
of a mother to you.

31:34.417 --> 31:35.959
I don't care, mom.

31:36.041 --> 31:39.250
Helen, please.
Just listen.
Okay?

31:39.333 --> 31:41.125
'All my life..'

31:41.208 --> 31:46.083
...I've been
somebody's daughter or wife.

31:46.166 --> 31:49.875
Always someone else's somebody.

31:49.959 --> 31:53.959
I never had
the chance to just...be me.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.333
'But what you did
last night made me'

31:59.417 --> 32:01.542
realize what is
truly important to
me..

32:04.250 --> 32:06.000
...you.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.917
I don't need a man.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.500
But I need my little girl.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.375
You can't
act like that anymore.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.667
You're the grown-ups, not us.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.625
I promise you
things are going to change.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.125
I just want my mom back.

32:30.208 --> 32:31.792
- I'm right here.
- No.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.000
I just need
to be alone. Okay?

32:40.583 --> 32:43.208
Okay.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.375
You're my once-in-a-lifetime.

32:54.458 --> 32:57.291
I don't even know
what that means.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.667
You will.

33:19.125 --> 33:21.542
(Lilly)
'Cardboard box and tinfoil?'

33:21.625 --> 33:23.750
Where was she going
with those things?

33:23.834 --> 33:25.208
I-I don't know.

33:30.917 --> 33:33.500
That was the way
I treated my mother..

33:35.125 --> 33:37.250
...the last time I saw her.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.250
She knew you loved her, Helen.

33:42.333 --> 33:45.959
Sixteen-year-old acting out
doesn't fool anyone.

33:55.709 --> 33:58.917
Know what you can make with
a cardboard box and tinfoil?

34:00.166 --> 34:01.875
Mm, I give up.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.291
Pinhole camera.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.083
I'm supposed
to know what that is?

34:06.166 --> 34:08.458
It's used
to watch an eclipse.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.166
(Will)
'Only other thing
you need to make it..'

34:10.250 --> 34:11.917
...is a sharp object.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.625
- Like an ice pick.
- 'Right.'

34:13.709 --> 34:17.667
The day Libby was killed,
February 26, 1979..

34:17.750 --> 34:20.333
...there was
a total solar
eclipse.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.458
Which Jed wanted to see.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.250
(John)
'Let's bring him
in for a talk, Will.'

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Hey.

34:37.083 --> 34:38.333
Hey.

34:47.125 --> 34:51.291
I've been thinking about
what you said the other
day.

34:51.375 --> 34:53.709
- Letting me down.
- Forget about it.

34:54.959 --> 34:57.667
That wasn't your fault.

34:57.750 --> 35:01.000
- 'You know.'
- Yeah. I know.

35:05.041 --> 35:06.625
So let's do it.

35:10.083 --> 35:15.583
Let's put this guy away.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.625
Ever get around to seeing
that eclipse, Jed?

35:49.709 --> 35:50.959
What eclipse?

35:51.041 --> 35:53.917
The one Libby
promised to show you.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.291
Libby..

35:55.375 --> 35:58.166
...didn't promise me that.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.291
Oh, that's too bad.

36:00.375 --> 36:04.041
Once-in-a-lifetime thing to see.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.375
Right.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.417
Your mom told us you were
in the woods that day

36:10.500 --> 36:12.458
watching the eclipse.

36:12.542 --> 36:14.917
She couldn't
have known
that.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.083
My parents never
knew where I was.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.959
So you were
out in the woods.

36:20.041 --> 36:22.875
Well, I..

36:22.959 --> 36:25.375
...went out there,
but not near Libby.

36:25.458 --> 36:28.917
(Jed)
'I mean, not where
she was found.'

36:29.000 --> 36:30.917
So, if you weren't out there
watching the eclipse

36:31.000 --> 36:32.625
what were you doing?

36:34.333 --> 36:36.041
Must have been confusing.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.583
Parents acting like kids.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.458
And where'd that leave you?

36:40.542 --> 36:43.083
- I was fine.
- Fine?

36:43.166 --> 36:45.750
Driving your dad's
mistress around?

36:45.834 --> 36:48.250
Pouring their drinks
while they talked about

36:48.333 --> 36:50.291
open marriage and key parties?

36:50.375 --> 36:53.667
Dirty dancing with
your fifth-grade teacher?

36:53.750 --> 36:56.667
I was 15, that would've
screwed me up good.

36:59.667 --> 37:02.125
It was like they
forgot we were
there.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.917
But you were there.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.291
Listening to every
word they said.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.166
Watching everything they did.

37:09.250 --> 37:11.291
We were just kids.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.208
They took that all away.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.667
What they did to you was wrong.

37:17.750 --> 37:22.542
What Libby did
to you was wrong.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.041
Talking to me..

37:25.834 --> 37:27.375
...dancing
with
me like that.

37:27.458 --> 37:31.250
So when she met you
in the woods..

37:31.333 --> 37:32.583
I..

37:35.625 --> 37:37.542
I thought she wanted more.

37:46.041 --> 37:47.834
Libby, I didn't think
you were going to show.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.792
God, you must be freezing. Here.

37:50.875 --> 37:53.208
I wasn't sure,
you know, I mean..

37:53.291 --> 37:55.166
After last night
with you and my dad.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.834
Oh, that has nothing
to do with us, Jed.

37:56.917 --> 37:58.542
I'd promised you
I'd show you
this.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.542
When are we going
driving again?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.834
Ah, look.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.959
You have been a great teacher.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.250
But I need to give
these back to you.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.834
I don't get it.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.875
I can't meet you anymore.

38:18.959 --> 38:20.166
Why? Did I do something wrong?

38:20.250 --> 38:21.709
No, no.

38:21.792 --> 38:25.625
- So why are you..
- I need more time with Helen.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.166
But what about me?

38:28.250 --> 38:30.834
- What do you mean?
- 'Dancing last night.'

38:30.917 --> 38:33.625
That blew me away.
I mean, it was hot.

38:33.709 --> 38:36.500
And now that you
and my dad are done..

38:36.583 --> 38:37.834
What?

38:37.917 --> 38:40.333
You and me can,
you know.

38:40.417 --> 38:41.709
Jed, that's not..

38:41.792 --> 38:43.458
I never meant
to give you that
idea.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.000
But I make you laugh.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.875
And on our driving lessons
sometimes you touch my hand.

38:49.959 --> 38:51.875
No, Jed, that's
not
what I meant.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.542
But you held me
against you.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.375
You turned me on
on purpose.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.834
I have to go. I'm sorry.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.709
- Don't walk away from me.
- Jed, you're a kid.

38:58.792 --> 39:00.083
We're friends. That's all.

39:00.166 --> 39:01.417
We have something heavy, okay.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.250
Our egos are liberated and..

39:03.333 --> 39:04.458
I want to
get it on with you.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.792
'The Eclipse.'

39:05.875 --> 39:08.917
- Jed, stop!
- You did it with my father.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.625
What's wrong with me?

39:11.709 --> 39:13.959
- Jed, stop!
- You promised.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.166
You promised!

39:22.500 --> 39:23.959
Mrs. Bradley?

39:28.333 --> 39:30.417
Get up! Mrs. Bradley!
