WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.086
- OH, MY GOD.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.254
WE HAVE A BABY.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.922
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:06.005 --> 00:08.800
- MARGARITA.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.760
- GREAT IDEA.
I'LL MAKE A PITCHER.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.054
- DRINKING NOW?
REALLY?

00:13.138 --> 00:15.557
- ACTUALLY, MARGARITA
WAS MY CHILDREN'S NANNY.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.434
I GUESS WHEN I SAW THE BABY,

00:17.517 --> 00:19.728
MY MATERNAL INSTINCT
JUST KICKED IN.

00:19.811 --> 00:23.565
- WHAT KIND OF A MONSTER
LEAVES A BABY ON A DOORSTEP?

00:23.648 --> 00:25.108
- THAT WOULD BE ME, MOM.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.151
- OWEN!

00:26.234 --> 00:29.279
- SORRY, I HAD SO MUCH STUFF
I MADE TWO TRIPS.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.782
- SO THIS IS YOUR BABY?

00:32.866 --> 00:35.118
I HAVE A GRAND...

00:35.201 --> 00:37.120
- SON.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.913
- OH, MY GOD.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.499
OH, MY GOD!

00:41.583 --> 00:44.961
EVERYBODY, THIS IS MY GRANDSON!

00:45.044 --> 00:48.131
[laughing excitedly]

00:48.214 --> 00:50.300
OWEN, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

00:50.383 --> 00:52.761
THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE,
THE BIG NEWS IN YOUR LIFE

00:52.844 --> 00:54.095
WAS THAT YOU'D GIVEN UP GLUTEN.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.264
- OH, GOOD FOR YOU!

00:57.891 --> 01:02.437
- A FEW WEEKS AGO, A GIRL THAT
I HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND WITH

01:02.520 --> 01:05.272
SUDDENLY SHOWED UP
ON MY DOORSTEP WITH A BABY.

01:05.355 --> 01:08.151
SHE SAID THAT SHE COULDN'T
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

01:08.234 --> 01:12.363
SO IT WAS EITHER ME,
OR PUT WILBUR UP FOR ADOPTION.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.449
I NEEDED TIME TO THINK.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.786
- THE TIME TO THINK

01:17.869 --> 01:21.164
WAS BEFORE YOU NAMED HIM WILBUR.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.462
- I AM SO SORRY
TO DUMP THIS ON YOU,

01:27.545 --> 01:29.464
BUT NOW THAT MY FOLKS ARE GONE,

01:29.547 --> 01:30.715
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO TURN TO.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.509
- OH, HONEY,
I'M GLAD YOU CAME TO ME.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.843
[baby crying]

01:33.927 --> 01:34.844
OH...

01:34.928 --> 01:36.387
OH, NO, HE'S CRYING.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.973
- HOLY CHER, IT'S A BABY!

01:46.439 --> 01:47.857
- HE STOPPED CRYING!

01:47.941 --> 01:48.733
- OF COURSE HE DID.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.361
MY VOICE IS VERY SOOTHING
TO BABIES.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.571
IT'S LIKE A LULLABY.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.867
- PIERRE, THAT'S
MY GOOD SILK ROBE.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.579
- OH, I KNOW--I'VE GOT ONE
AT HOME JUST LIKE IT.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.289
- UM, IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.166
- OH, GOOD GOD, NO.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.585
- HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.927
- ♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

02:16.010 --> 02:19.138
♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

02:19.222 --> 02:20.098
♪ HEY! ♪

02:20.181 --> 02:21.349
- I LOVE THE NAME WILBUR.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.892
I THINK IT'S STRONG AND UNIQUE.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.394
{\an8}WHAT'S OWEN'S LAST NAME AGAIN?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.771
{\an8}- BURR.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.524
{\an8}SO...WILBUR BURR.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.026
{\an8}[timer dings]

02:32.110 --> 02:33.069
{\an8}- YOUR FIVE MINUTES ARE UP.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.237
{\an8}MY TURN TO HOLD THE BABY.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.738
{\an8}HELLO.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.032
{\an8}MMM, NEW BABY SMELL.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.409
{\an8}BRINGS ME RIGHT BACK.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.078
{\an8}ONE MINUTE YOU'RE YOUNG,
HOLDING YOUR BABIES,

02:42.161 --> 02:43.538
{\an8}THEN POOF--

02:43.621 --> 02:45.915
{\an8}THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN,
AND SUDDENLY SO ARE YOU.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.918
{\an8}TIME JUST GOES BY SO QUICKLY.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.044
{\an8}- DING!

02:50.128 --> 02:51.045
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, HAND HIM OVER.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.630
{\an8}- NO, THE TIMER DIDN'T GO OFF.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.591
{\an8}- YES, BUT NEW BABY SMELL
IS TURNING YOU

02:54.674 --> 02:56.551
{\an8}INTO PHILOSOPHICAL,
RED WINE MELANIE

02:56.634 --> 02:58.553
{\an8}INSTEAD OF CHEERFUL,
WHITE WINE MELANIE.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.764
{\an8}- SORRY.
BABIES MAKE ME THINK ABOUT LIFE.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.600
{\an8}NOW THAT I'M ALL CAUGHT UP
ON <i> THE GOOD WIFE,</i>

03:03.683 --> 03:05.935
{\an8}I COULD USE ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.896
{\an8}- THIS IS NICE.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.232
{\an8}YOU KNOW, BEING A WORKING MOM,
I DIDN'T GET TO DO THIS ENOUGH.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.818
{\an8}HEY, WILL.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.737
{\an8}SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OWEN'S GOING TO DO?

03:15.820 --> 03:16.905
{\an8}- WELL, IT'S HIS DECISION,

03:16.988 --> 03:18.948
{\an8}AND I'LL SUPPORT
WHATEVER HE CHOOSES.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.784
{\an8}OH, BUT, GOD,
I HOPE HE KEEPS HIM.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.952
{\an8}OH...

03:23.036 --> 03:26.456
{\an8}30 YEARS AGO, I GAVE AWAY
A LITTLE BOY JUST LIKE HIM.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.291
{\an8}AND I CAN'T BEAR
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.417
{\an8}DING! MY TURN.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.587
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
MAKE HIS DECISION A LOT EASIER

03:32.670 --> 03:34.964
{\an8}BY SHOWING HIM
THAT HE'LL GET PLENTY OF HELP

03:35.048 --> 03:36.633
{\an8}FROM THE PERFECT GRANDMOTHER.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.009
- OR GRANDMOTHERS.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.261
- AND ONE SURPRISINGLY
YOUTHFUL AUNT.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.764
OR OLDER SISTER,
IN THE RIGHT LIGHTING.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.434
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.769
NOT ABOUT THE OLDER
SISTER THING.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.479
THAT'S JUST INSANE.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.022
BUT THE IDEA COULD WORK.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.149
I'M GONNA BE
THE PERFECT GRANDMOTHER.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.151
- AND YOU CAN START BY TAKING
ALL THE NIGHT FEEDINGS.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.278
- NIGHT FEEDINGS?
WHAT ARE THOSE?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.947
ONCE YOU TURN OFF
THE BABY MONITOR,

03:59.030 --> 04:00.531
THEY SLEEP TILL MORNING.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.370
NOT A PEEP.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.125
- MAN, OH, MANILOW.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.585
WHERE'S THE BABY?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.173
- OH, MY GOD, WHERE'S WILBUR?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.216
- WHERE COULD HE BE?

04:18.298 --> 04:20.009
- MAYBE THE DINGO ATE IT.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.516
- GUESS WHO JUST GOT A PART
IN A WOODY ALLEN MOVIE?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.184
- OH, THANK GOD,
HE'S WITH VICTORIA.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.310
- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD US.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.144
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL ANSWER.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.939
I GOT A PART
IN A WOODY ALLEN MOVIE.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.190
- IS HE OKAY?
DID YOU FEED HIM?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.400
- OH, HE'S FINE.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.026
HE'S BEEN NAPPING
FOR THE LAST HOUR.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.445
- WELL, I'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE SALON.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.115
THAT SAUCY MINX,
MRS. WALBAUM,

04:42.198 --> 04:44.993
IS BEGGING ME
TO GIVE HER A SHAG.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.204
- YOU BETTER MEAN THE HAIRCUT.

04:48.287 --> 04:50.665
- DON'T HATE THE STYLIST, BABY.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.875
HATE THE GAME.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.504
- WILL I SEE YOU TONIGHT?

04:56.587 --> 04:58.256
- OH, TONIGHT...

04:58.339 --> 05:00.383
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.260
I'LL CALL YOU.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.889
- WAS THAT A BRUSH-OFF?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.642
JOY, YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.227
WAS THAT A BRUSH-OFF?

05:11.310 --> 05:13.604
- YES, IT WAS A BRUSH-OFF!

05:13.688 --> 05:16.691
NOW, WHO'S GONNA CONGRATULATE ME
ON MY MOVIE?

05:16.774 --> 05:18.735
- CONGRATULATIONS, VICTORIA.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.527
- HOW DID YOU GET IT?

05:19.610 --> 05:21.362
- WELL, LAST NIGHT
I WAS THINKING,

05:21.446 --> 05:23.865
IF WILBUR GOT A JOB HERE,
THEN HE'D HAVE TO STAY.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.076
SO I WENT ONLINE,
AND I LOOKED UP BABY AUDITIONS.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.370
- YOU TOOK MY GRANDSON
ON AN AUDITION?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.415
- WELL, WHAT PARENT DOESN'T
WANT THEIR CHILD TO BE A STAR?

05:32.498 --> 05:33.750
- OH, RIGHT.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.253
OH, THOSE KIDS TURN OUT GREAT.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.216
- ANYWAY,
WILBUR BLEW HIS AUDITION,

05:42.300 --> 05:43.551
BUT I GOT A PART.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.428
- STILL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE SCARED ME LIKE THAT.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.888
- OH, WILBUR WAS PERFECTLY FINE.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.765
HE HASN'T EVEN CRIED ONCE.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.103
- THAT'S NOT WILBUR.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.647
- ARE YOU SURE?
WE JUST MET HIM YESTERDAY.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.068
- HE'S BLACK, YOU IDIOT.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.574
- OKAY, WE'RE HERE.
WHERE IS HE?

06:06.657 --> 06:07.450
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.243
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK
LIKE DETECTIVES,

06:09.327 --> 06:10.244
LOOK FOR CLUES.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.579
- OH, MY GOD,
WHERE'S MY BABY?

06:11.662 --> 06:13.331
THIS ISN'T MY BABY.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.957
- THERE'S ONE.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.920
- WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.130
ARE YOU STILL CHECKING YOUR
PHONE TO SEE IF PIERRE CALLED?

06:21.214 --> 06:24.759
- THE MAN'S BEEN HITTING ON ME
FOR 20 YEARS.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.761
AND NOW IT'S "I'LL CALL YOU."

06:26.844 --> 06:28.304
- WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.306
- WELL, I HAVEN'T.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.768
HOW DO YOU GET
THE UPPER HAND BACK?

06:33.851 --> 06:36.270
- WELL, THE CLASSIC WAY WOULD BE

06:36.354 --> 06:37.772
TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
WITH ANOTHER GUY.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.191
DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE?

06:40.274 --> 06:43.319
- HIS BROTHER, ETIENNE.

06:43.402 --> 06:47.031
HE'S EVEN LESS TRADITIONALLY
MASCULINE THAN PIERRE.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.743
- SERIOUSLY?

06:50.827 --> 06:54.038
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A WHEATGRASS
SMOOTHIE IN THIS TOWN?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.498
CLEVELAND BLOWS.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.959
- LISTEN, SISTER--
- ELKA, I'LL HANDLE THIS.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.962
EXCUSE ME.
CLEVELAND DOES NOT BLOW.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.798
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE HUMIDITY IS DISGUSTING.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.175
AND WHAT KIND OF CITY
DOESN'T HAVE A FOUR SEASONS?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.636
EVEN BALTIMORE
HAS A FOUR SEASONS.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.429
- OKAY, YOU WANT
TO TALK FOUR SEASONS,

07:10.513 --> 07:12.181
WE HAVE GOT A BEAUTIFUL,
SNOW-WHITE WINTER,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.350
A SPRING SO GREEN YOU'LL CRY
AT THE FIRST CROCUS,

07:14.433 --> 07:16.018
AND A LAKESIDE SUMMER SO SWEET
YOU'LL SWEAR

07:16.102 --> 07:17.979
THAT NORMAN ROCKWELL WAS SITTING
RIGHT THERE--

07:18.062 --> 07:19.147
- SECURITY!

07:19.230 --> 07:20.148
- I'LL HANDLE THIS.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.359
- AND CLEVELAND ALSO HAS
GORGEOUS SECURITY...

07:23.442 --> 07:25.319
FOR SOME ODD REASON.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.529
- CHLOE POWELL.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.239
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK
FOR ME?

07:28.322 --> 07:29.574
- OH, IN SECURITY?

07:29.657 --> 07:32.368
I'D BE TERRIBLE.
I'M A TRUSTER.

07:32.451 --> 07:35.538
- NO, MY COMPANY DEVELOPS
CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE CLEVELAND.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.832
AND THE SPIN YOU JUST
PUT ON THIS TOWN WAS PURE MAGIC.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.000
- ARE YOU REALLY
OFFERING ME A JOB?

07:39.083 --> 07:41.335
BECAUSE I WAS JUST TELLING
MY GIRLFRIENDS LAST NIGHT--

07:41.419 --> 07:44.338
- IT'S JUST A JOB.
DON'T MAKE IT A THING.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.382
WALK AND TALK.
- OKAY.

07:46.465 --> 07:47.800
I GOT A JOB!

07:51.804 --> 07:52.847
- UH-HUH.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.390
UH-HUH.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.560
SO BASICALLY,
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.396
- WELL, I RAISED TWO CHILDREN.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.399
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF
AS AN ACCOMPLISHED HOME MANAGER.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.735
- I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF
AS PUSHING 40.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.195
AND YOU'LL THINK OF ME
THAT WAY TOO

08:07.278 --> 08:09.488
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.867
- YEAH, I'M ALSO PUSHING 40.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.493
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.206
THANK YOU, LAURA.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.624
FINAL QUESTION.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.542
HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE WORLD PEACE?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.252
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.962
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT IS SOLVABLE.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.590
- AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID
21 YEARS AGO

08:27.673 --> 08:30.509
AS MISS OHIO
TO MR. GARY COLLINS.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.889
BUT THOSE MISS AMERICA BASTARDS
COULDN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.140
I CAME IN SECOND PLACE!

08:36.224 --> 08:37.225
- OH, MY GOD!

08:37.308 --> 08:38.267
YOU WERE FIRST RUNNER-UP!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.309
- YES!

08:39.393 --> 08:40.436
AND THOSE 364 DAYS

08:40.519 --> 08:42.980
I WAITED FOR MISS NEW JERSEY
TO CROAK OR DO NUDIES

08:43.063 --> 08:44.690
WERE THE LONGEST DAYS
OF MY LIFE.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.986
MELANIE, I LIKE YOUR SHOES.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.113
THEY SAY POWER, STYLE,
CONFIDENCE--

08:51.197 --> 08:52.114
TAKE THEM OFF.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.282
- SERIOUSLY?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.285
- YES, I WANT TO WEAR THEM
TO MY MEETING WITH THE MAYOR.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.581
HMM.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.500
THEY REALLY LOOK BETTER
WITH YOUR BLOUSE.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.794
- [laughing] GOOD ONE.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.137
[thinking]
BOY, HE'S CUTE.

09:15.221 --> 09:20.309
I'D FLIRT IF I WASN'T BAREFOOT
AND WEARING A FLOWERED TARP.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.603
I LOOK LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.439
I NEED SOME SUBTLE WAY
TO LET HIM KNOW I'M NOT CRAZY.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.275
I'M NOT CRAZY.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.194
- ME EITHER.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.113
- I-I KNOW I LOOK CRAZY,

09:32.196 --> 09:34.031
BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN
MY JACKET.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.826
I BORROWED IT AFTER MY NEW BOSS
MADE ME TAKE OFF MY BLOUSE.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.871
FOR WORK REASONS.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.041
I WOULD'VE BORROWED SHOES TOO,

09:44.125 --> 09:47.044
EXCEPT EVERYBODY ELSE'S FEET
WERE WAY SMALLER THAN MINE.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.796
NOT THAT MY FEET ARE BIG.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.465
IT'S JUST IT WAS AN OFFICE
FULL OF FREAKISHLY SMALL FEET.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.843
YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS A NEW JOB,

09:53.926 --> 09:56.053
AND MY FEET SWELL
WHEN I GET NERVOUS,

09:56.137 --> 09:58.472
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.557
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:06.605 --> 10:08.232
- TALL BUILDING.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.695
- BIG NEWS.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.406
I JUST GOT THE FIRST PAGE
OF THE SCRIPT.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.949
LISTEN TO MY FIRST LINE.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.535
"PEOPLE LIKE US"...

10:19.618 --> 10:23.748
WAIT--WAS IT "PEOPLE <i> LIKE</i> US"
OR "<i> PEOPLE,</i> LIKE US."

10:25.416 --> 10:27.168
- WELL, WHAT'S THE LINE BEFORE?

10:27.251 --> 10:28.711
- WELL, HE ONLY SENT
THE ONE LINE.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.504
THERE'S NO CONTEXT.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.340
I MEAN, I'VE GOT
TO MAKE THIS THING SING.

10:32.423 --> 10:36.218
YOU KNOW--
MAYBE HE WANTS ME TO SING.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.097
♪ PEOPLE LIKE US ♪

10:41.098 --> 10:42.850
- HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SING.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.728
- I GOT A JOB!

10:45.811 --> 10:47.772
- IN THAT JACKET?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.775
- MY BOSS MADE ME
TAKE MY TOP OFF.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.651
- BEEN THERE.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.698
- OH, MY GOD, JOY.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.450
WHY IS THERE A STRIPE
ON WILBUR'S FACE?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.121
- OH, JUST THE LITTLEST MIX-UP

11:04.205 --> 11:06.123
WITH BABY WIPES
AND TANNING WIPES.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.084
BUT LOOK WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.086
I'M TURNING
HIS PRECIOUS FOOTPRINT

11:10.169 --> 11:12.755
INTO A TIMELESS MEMORY
IN CEMENT.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.799
[timer dings]

11:17.009 --> 11:17.968
- OH, NO.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.220
- WHY ISN'T IT COMING OFF?

11:19.303 --> 11:20.429
- IT'S STUCK.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.098
MELANIE, GOOGLE:

11:22.181 --> 11:24.892
"BABY FOOT STUCK IN CEMENT,"
HASHTAG: "NO ONE'S FAULT."

11:25.976 --> 11:28.187
- WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION?

11:33.692 --> 11:35.444
- ELKA, YOUR HAIR.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
- ETIENNE DID IT.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.949
AT ETIENNE'S HOUSE OF HAIR.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.618
FORMERLY SUPERCUTS.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.164
- OH, NO, WILBUR, GIVE ME THAT.
- WHAT?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.834
- YOU DROPPED A BLACK MARKER
IN THE BASSINET.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.839
- HE LOOKS LIKE HITLER!

11:57.383 --> 11:59.260
- HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HITLER.

11:59.343 --> 12:05.015
HE LOOKS LIKE CHARLIE CHAPLIN
IN <i> THE GREAT DICTATOR.</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:07.518
- WHERE HE PLAYED HITLER.

12:07.601 --> 12:11.063
- I THINK THIS'LL KNOCK
THE PLASTER OFF HIS FOOT.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.356
- NO!
- NO, NO, BACK AWAY.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.858
I JUST NEED TO GIVE HIM
ONE GOOD SMACK.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.318
- WHOA!
WAIT.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.820
STOP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:17.903 --> 12:20.656
- JUST TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.

12:20.739 --> 12:23.659
- WHO THINKS THIS IS
HOW YOU TAKE CARE OF A BABY?

12:23.742 --> 12:26.036
- PEOPLE LIKE US?

12:27.204 --> 12:29.498
PEOPLE <i> LIKE</i> US.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.173
- AGAIN, I AM SO, SO SORRY.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.550
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU MEANT WELL.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.177
- LOOK.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.345
I KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
YOU CAME HERE,

12:43.429 --> 12:44.930
WE SHOT YOU.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.518
AND THEN WE LOST YOUR BABY

12:49.602 --> 12:51.562
AND GAVE HIM A CEMENT FOOT

12:51.645 --> 12:55.566
AND A HITLER MUSTACHE.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.360
BUT I SWEAR, NORMALLY
THINGS ARE SO QUIET HERE.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.031
IT'S JUST FOUR GRANDMOTHER TYPES
HANGING OUT.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.242
- WHERE THE HELL IS
THAT TWO-TIMING HUSSY?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.496
ELKA!

13:08.579 --> 13:09.830
ELKA!

13:14.627 --> 13:17.296
SWEET PEACHES AND HERB,
IT'S TRUE!

13:18.422 --> 13:23.552
- PIERRE, MY FUN
MODERN HAIRSTYLE AND I

13:23.636 --> 13:25.596
WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.057
- I KNOW WHO DID THIS TO YOU:

13:28.140 --> 13:29.225
MY BROTHER, ETIENNE.

13:29.308 --> 13:35.147
- YES, AND HE'S GONNA KEEP
DOING IT TO ME EVERY WEEK.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.904
- YOU KNOW YOU NEED IT DONE
MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.365
- NOT THE WAY HE DOES IT.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.746
- IF YOU ARE TRYING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS,

13:50.829 --> 13:52.915
IT'S NOT WORKING!

13:52.998 --> 13:57.670
- I'D SAY IT'S WORKING
JUST FINE.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.883
- WELL, THAT HAPPENED.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.760
- IT'S OKAY.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.303
WILBUR SLEPT THROUGH IT.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.141
I GET IT NOW.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.393
- WHAT?

14:12.476 --> 14:14.603
- [sighing]
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.064
HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN
FOR YOU TO GIVE ME UP.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.775
- IT WAS HORRIBLE.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.610
- I USED TO THINK,

14:21.694 --> 14:24.613
"HOW COULD SHE NOT LOVE ME
ENOUGH TO KEEP ME?"

14:24.697 --> 14:27.324
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU LOVED ME
ENOUGH TO GIVE ME AWAY.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.325
- IT HELPED TO THINK

14:28.409 --> 14:31.745
THAT I WAS GIVING SOMEONE ELSE
AN AMAZING GIFT.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.289
- THE IRONIC THING IS,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.541
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.792
YOU KNOW, AS AN ACTUARY.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.626
- YES.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.420
- STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
DO YOU?

14:39.503 --> 14:41.088
- NO.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.632
- I ASSESS RISK.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.843
JUST THE FACTS, NO EMOTIONS.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.768
I SHOULD PUT WILBUR
UP FOR ADOPTION.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.815
- WELL, THEN.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.776
I SUPPORT YOUR DECISION.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.446
- I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.573
- FOR THE BEST.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.452
- [sighs]

15:11.535 --> 15:14.163
- EXCUSE ME, CHLOE?

15:14.246 --> 15:15.497
OH, NO.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.791
- HEY, CRAZY ELEVATOR LADY.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.794
- I KNEW YOU THOUGHT
I WAS CRAZY.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.672
- NO, NOT AT FIRST,
BUT THE EVIDENCE PILED UP.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.715
YOU MUST BE MELANIE.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.300
CHLOE AND I ARE PARTNERS.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.301
I'M ALEC JONES.

15:27.384 --> 15:28.344
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.386
- HAVE A SEAT.
- OKAY.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.890
- SO I NEED YOUR HELP
ON THE WOODY ALLEN MOVIE.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.892
NOW, I CONVINCED WOODY
TO SHOOT HERE IN CLEVELAND,

15:34.975 --> 15:36.685
BASED ON OUR THRIVING
DIXIELAND JAZZ SCENE.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.895
- VERY SMART.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.273
- NOW I JUST HAVE TO CREATE A
THRIVING DIXIELAND JAZZ SCENE.

15:41.357 --> 15:46.028
- [thinking] I WONDER WHAT
IT WOULD BE LIKE TO KISS HIM.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.032
- MELANIE.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.659
MELANIE.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.534
- YES.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.203
- I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.871
- YOU DO?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.086
SEE, YOU CAN'T JUST...

16:02.169 --> 16:04.254
DO...
THAT.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.881
- LOOK, THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.883
WOMEN SPEND SO MUCH TIME
THINKING ABOUT WHAT

16:07.966 --> 16:10.052
IT WOULD BE LIKE TO KISS ME
THAT WE NEVER GET ANY WORK DONE.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.596
SO I JUST GET THE KISS
OUT OF THE WAY.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.015
- [scoffing]
THAT'S VERY PRESUMPTUOUS.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.892
- I'M CLEVELAND'S
MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR.

16:16.975 --> 16:20.688
- AND SOMEBODY'S A LITTLE
FULL OF THEMSELVES TOO.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.481
- NO, IT'S TRUE.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.484
- OH.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.404
- FIVE YEARS IN A ROW.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.239
KIND OF A NUISANCE,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.741
BUT CHLOE THINKS
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS, SO...

16:32.825 --> 16:35.119
- ALEC, WE'VE GOT TO BE DOWNTOWN
IN 15 MINUTES.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.745
- YES. BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.497
WELCOME ABOARD.
- THANK YOU.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.210
- SO I SEE YOU'VE MET
MY HUSBAND.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.295
- HUSBAND?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.589
- WELL, TECHNICALLY, EX-HUSBAND.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.924
BUT WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.884
SO ANYWAY, HANDS OFF, OKAY?

16:50.968 --> 16:51.927
- YES. YEAH.
SURE.

16:52.010 --> 16:52.928
NO WAY.

16:53.011 --> 16:53.929
- THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

16:54.012 --> 16:55.597
I MEAN,
I'LL CUT YOUR HANDS OFF

16:55.681 --> 16:58.475
IF YOU GO ANYWHERE NEAR HIM.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.937
OH, THAT'S JUST A LITTLE JOKE
I USE WHEN I'M DEADLY SERIOUS.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.319
- I THINK THIS IS
THE LAST OF IT.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.238
- LET US KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.282
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.492
- MY HEART IS BREAKING.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.161
- MINE TOO.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.954
I REALLY LIKED
HAVING A BABY IN THE HOUSE.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.999
- YEAH, I'M GONNA MISS THIS GUY.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.461
- EVERYBODY,
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

17:25.544 --> 17:27.212
SO I DON'T FALL APART.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.799
{\an1}- WELL, I GOT A NEW JOB THAT I
THINK I MIGHT REALLY BE GOOD AT.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.093
BUT I HAVE THE HOTS
FOR MY HOT NEW BOSS,

17:33.177 --> 17:35.471
WHO MY OTHER HOT BOSS
STILL HAS THE HOTS FOR.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.264
SO IT'S JUST A BIG HOT MESS.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.266
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.478
- I MADE PIERRE JEALOUS.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.354
BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD
OF HAVING THE UPPER HAND

17:44.438 --> 17:46.523
IF THERE'S NOBODY TO HOLD IT?

17:46.607 --> 17:49.276
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.528
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.613
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.991
I GOT THE NEXT PAGE OF DIALOG,
AND THAT'S MY LINE.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.660
THERE'S NO PUNCTUATION,
NO STAGE DIRECTION.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
AM I PROUD?

18:00.579 --> 18:02.414
"WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!"

18:02.498 --> 18:04.958
OR AM I TALKING
ABOUT A TWO-HEADED CALF?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.835
"UGH, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT."

18:06.919 --> 18:09.296
OR IS THERE AN ASIAN CHARACTER
NAMED WOULD YOU?

18:09.379 --> 18:11.590
AND I'M TRYING TO GET HIM
TO LOOK AT THE TWO-HEADED CALF:

18:11.673 --> 18:14.676
"WOULD YOU! LOOK AT THAT!"

18:14.760 --> 18:17.679
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S THE LAST ONE.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.266
- OKAY, LET'S GET HIM
IN HIS CAR SEAT.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.644
- ELKA, WE NEED TO TALK.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.020
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

18:25.103 --> 18:26.522
- OWEN'S LEAVING WITH THE BABY.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.898
HE'S PUTTING HIM UP
FOR ADOPTION.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.691
- WHICH WAS DIFFICULT AT FIRST,

18:29.775 --> 18:31.610
BUT NOW WE ALL AGREE,
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.028
- YES!
- THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.154
- YEAH...

18:34.238 --> 18:36.031
- WHY IS EVERYBODY LYING?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.407
- WE'RE NOT LYING.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.867
- LOOK, I'M A HAIRDRESSER.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.036
I KNOW HUMAN NATURE
RIGHT DOWN TO THE ROOTS.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.372
YOU ALL LOOK LIKE
YOU WENT AND ASKED FOR BANGS,

18:43.455 --> 18:45.749
AND NOW YOU REGRET IT.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.212
- HE'S RIGHT.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.880
I WANT TO KEEP WILBUR
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.800
BUT HOW CAN I TAKE CARE OF HIM
ALL BY MYSELF?

18:54.883 --> 18:56.677
- YOU'VE GOT FOUR PEOPLE
RIGHT HERE...

18:56.760 --> 18:58.428
- MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.014
- BUT I DON'T LIVE IN CLEVELAND.
- BUT YOU COULD.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.433
CLEVELAND'S ONE OF THE MOST
LIVABLE PLACES IN THE COUNTRY.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.102
IT'S GOT BEAUTIFUL,
SNOW-WHITE WINTERS--

19:05.185 --> 19:08.230
- MELANIE.
- IT'S NICE.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.942
- SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:12.025 --> 19:14.069
- WELL...

19:14.153 --> 19:18.574
IF YOU'RE REALLY
OKAY WITH THIS...

19:18.657 --> 19:19.616
I'LL DO IT.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.576
[laughter]

19:20.659 --> 19:24.288
- I AM GONNA BE
THE BEST GRANDMOTHER EVER.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.707
I MEAN, SURE,
I MIGHT MAKE A FEW MISTAKES.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.709
I DO SEEM PRONE
TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF...

19:28.792 --> 19:29.751
- STOP.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.754
