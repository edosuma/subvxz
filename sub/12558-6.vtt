BEFORE OR THE YEAR AFTER.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.226

20:38.320 --> 20:40.448
THAT WAS JUST
A THEORY, CAPTAIN.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.067
NO, NO, IT'S
NOT A THEORY,

20:42.158 --> 20:43.740

HAPPENED TO US'.!</i>

20:45.035 --> 20:46.821
RIGHT INTO
THE FUTURE.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.744

THERE IS IN THE FUTURE?

20:48.831 --> 20:50.447
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

20:50.541 --> 20:52.908
NO, NO, ONLY THE
PROBABLE FUTURE.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.242
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

20:54.336 --> 20:56.327
THAT MEANS
WE'RE NOT DEAD.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.585
AND IT ALSO MEANS VVE'RE
GOING TO BE DEAD.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.177
NOT IF WE
DON'T GO UP.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.251
IF VVE DON'T GO UP,
VVE CAN'T CRASH.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.760
NOW, IT'S THE
ONLY ANSWER.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.758
WE'RE ALIVE
NOW, MASON.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.339
THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE CERTAIN

21:08.434 --> 21:09.765
THAT WE STAY ALIVE--
YOU, CARTER, ME--

21:09.852 --> 21:10.933
IS NOT TO GO UP.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.351
THEN WE CAN'T CRASH.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.520
WE AVOID IT,
WE PREVENT IT.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.976
WE STAY.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.312
THAT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR
YOU TO DECIDE, CAPTAIN.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.192
NOW, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.900
YOU'\/E GOT NO ONE VVAITING
FOR YOU BACK ON EARTH.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.993
I'VE MADE
MY DECISION.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.122
I SAY WE
VOTE ON IT.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.624
YOU DO?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.331
YOU'RE NOT THE
ONLY ONE, CAPTAIN.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.336
I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT
GIVES THE ORDERS.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.088
EVEN WHERE OUR
LIVES ARE CONCERNED?

21:45.179 --> 21:48.012
ESPECIALLY VVHERE YOUR
Ll\/ES ARE CONCERNED!

21:48.098 --> 21:50.556
I SAID WE STAY!

21:50.643 --> 21:52.179
FOR HOW
LONG, CAPTAIN?

21:52.269 --> 21:53.646
I'M NOT SETTING
ANY LIMIT.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.969
<i>ONE MONTH'? TWO MONTHS'?
A YEAR'?</i>

21:55.064 --> 21:56.725
I SAID I'M
NOT SETTING--

21:56.816 --> 21:58.477
<i>WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOOD TO STAY THAT LONG.</i>

21:58.526 --> 22:00.233
I'VE NO DOUBT THERE'S
EDIBLE FOOD OUTSIDE.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.980
HOVV VVILL VVE KNOVV WHAT'S
EDIBLE AND VVHAT ISN'T?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.440
WE'LL WATCH
THE ANIMALS.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.317
I SAW NO ANIMALS,
CAPTAIN, DID YOU?

22:05.407 --> 22:07.148
THERE WILL BE.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.324
IF THERE ARE, IT'LL BE A
DIFFERENT FORM OF LIFE

22:08.369 --> 22:09.609
FROM WHAT WE KNOW.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.080
WHAT COULD
EDIBLE TO THEM

22:11.163 --> 22:13.029
MIGHT BE DEADLY
POISONOUS FOR US!

22:13.123 --> 22:14.409
<i>WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT
WHEN THE TIME COMES!</i>

22:14.500 --> 22:15.865
THE ONLY IMPORTANT
THING NOW

22:15.960 --> 22:17.746
IS THE PRESERVATION
OF OUR LIVES!

22:17.837 --> 22:19.168
IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY
TO STAY HERE PERMANENTLY.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.837
WE MAY FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.880
BUT FOR NOVV, THE
DECISION IS TO STAY.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.378
NOT OUR DECISION.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.505
HAVE YOU A
BETTER SOLUTION?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.600

MINIMUM CAPACITY,

23:23.694 --> 23:27.608

CAN HOLD CUT FOR MONTHS.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.063
WE WON'T
BE WORKING

23:29.158 --> 23:31.274

23:31.368 --> 23:32.984

23:33.078 --> 23:37.572

NEED HEAT-LOTS OF IT.

I DON'T KNOW.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.848
HOVV COULD VVE
DUPLICATE IT, CAPTAIN?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.428
HOW CAN THERE--

24:00.522 --> 24:03.480
HOW CAN THERE BE
TWO CRASHED SHIPS,

24:03.567 --> 24:04.773
TWO OF ME DEAD,

24:04.860 --> 24:07.477

24:07.571 --> 24:09.482
