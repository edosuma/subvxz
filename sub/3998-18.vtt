WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:04.452
Thank you so much for having us
over for brunch, guys.

00:04.486 --> 00:06.621
It's the least that we could do
to celebrate the one-week anniversary

00:06.656 --> 00:09.557
of your sister moving in with me
and becoming my live-in lover.

00:09.591 --> 00:10.724
Was a little fast.

00:10.759 --> 00:12.125
Babe, you have syrup on your face.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.794
Oh, you can get it.
Mmm.

00:15.630 --> 00:16.964
Babe, you have some powdered sugar...

00:16.998 --> 00:18.498
(muffled): Back off! I'm starving!

00:18.533 --> 00:20.067
Come on. Just let me get it off.
It's so much.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.969
Get your own French toast, Jess!

00:22.003 --> 00:24.471
I got these slices,
so they're for me to eat.

00:24.505 --> 00:26.940
If you want the slices,
get your own slices.

00:26.974 --> 00:29.409
Coach: Um, that's
your fourth plate, Winston.

00:29.722 --> 00:31.444
I'm trying to bulk up
for the LAPD fitness exam.

00:31.478 --> 00:33.746
I am going to ace
this obstacle course.

00:33.781 --> 00:35.949
Schmidt, you got something crazy
around your neck.

00:35.983 --> 00:39.018
Abby made this. Look.
Ow. Look at that.

00:39.053 --> 00:41.320
- Not a fan.
- I forgot how much I love making jewelry.

00:41.354 --> 00:43.021
Schmidt's been lending me money
for supplies.

00:43.056 --> 00:45.423
- Yeah.
- Schmidt, are you bleeding?

00:45.458 --> 00:47.926
Oh, look at that.
I most certainly am. Wow.

00:47.961 --> 00:50.428
What makes Abby's jewelry
so interesting

00:50.463 --> 00:53.431
is that it's actually
dangerous and can cut you.

00:53.466 --> 00:55.200
Abby's gonna open up her own
store one day. Mark my words.

00:55.234 --> 00:56.534
- She shouldn't do that.
- Nope.

00:56.569 --> 00:58.769
I'm gonna open up
a store in your mouth.

00:58.804 --> 01:00.170
But now that you're living here,
I can have my old room back.

01:00.205 --> 01:02.640
Jess, I'm gonna need you gone by 5:00.

01:02.674 --> 01:06.376
- Done. I need a break from
Snore-a Ephron over here. - Okay.

01:06.411 --> 01:09.013
Oh, Schmidt and I don't need any space.
We have no boundaries.

01:09.047 --> 01:11.849
But I guess not everybody can
have what Schmidt and I have.

01:11.883 --> 01:13.617
You guys will probably get
there. Don't worry.

01:13.651 --> 01:15.184
Remember how long
it took you to get boobs?

01:15.219 --> 01:17.854
Yeah, but I started
shaving my legs at nine.

01:17.888 --> 01:20.957
So joke's on you.

01:20.992 --> 01:22.993
Mmm.

01:25.997 --> 01:28.364
Wait. We have so much sex.

01:28.398 --> 01:32.467
Don't try to eat the other
slice. I'm gonna get to it.

01:38.474 --> 01:40.279
Can you believe Abby and Schmidt?

01:40.429 --> 01:43.746
Yeah, tell me about it. Making love
at their own brunch? No class.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.514
They're a fake couple. They're
not real. We're a real couple.

01:46.548 --> 01:48.516
If anyone should be moving
in together, it's us.

01:48.550 --> 01:50.184
Well, you know, we already live
in the same apartment.

01:50.218 --> 01:52.219
Right. So why not take
the extra step?

01:52.254 --> 01:54.555
We basically sleep in each
other's rooms every night,

01:54.589 --> 01:56.057
so what is the difference?

01:56.091 --> 01:57.424
It's a really big difference.

01:57.459 --> 01:59.426
Because right now we're roommates

01:59.461 --> 02:01.928
but we're not living together.
Not "living together."

02:01.963 --> 02:03.897
- You know?
- No.

02:03.994 --> 02:06.232
Living together is a step.
It's official.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.035
It's an official step
in a relationship.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.401
So the word "official" is the key.

02:09.436 --> 02:11.337
Abby and Schmidt did it
after one week.

02:11.372 --> 02:14.407
Come on. We have so much left
to learn about each other,

02:14.441 --> 02:16.576
stuff you can only learn
if you're crammed together

02:16.610 --> 02:19.045
in a small space
and you can't get out.

02:19.079 --> 02:20.913
Just you and me.
Four walls.

02:20.947 --> 02:22.514
No boundaries, no escape.

02:22.549 --> 02:24.516
When you put it like that,
it sounds amazing.

02:24.551 --> 02:26.518
- And like prison.
- Well, I feel like

02:26.553 --> 02:29.521
if we get tired of each other,
I can always run across the hall

02:29.556 --> 02:32.858
to my room. It's so close.
Just pop over there.

02:32.893 --> 02:34.025
Mm.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.894
- Do you not want to?
- Whoa.

02:35.928 --> 02:37.162
(whistles)

02:37.196 --> 02:39.297
I did not...

02:39.331 --> 02:43.434
- That did not...
- So you're saying you do want to?

02:43.468 --> 02:44.869
(chuckles)

02:44.904 --> 02:46.604
Oh, my God,

02:46.638 --> 02:48.639
Nick, we're moving in together!

02:48.674 --> 02:50.240
- Officially? We just agreed on it?
- Yes!

02:50.274 --> 02:53.143
Yes! I cannot think
of a reason why not to.

02:53.178 --> 02:56.413
Reason 13: I like my stuff
and I hate her stuff.

02:56.447 --> 02:59.416
Reason number 14: How am I
ever gonna change my clothes?

02:59.450 --> 03:00.584
You don't change in front
of your girlfriend?

03:00.618 --> 03:02.219
You get naked in front of her.

03:02.253 --> 03:04.621
Yes, but those are different things.
When you're naked,

03:04.655 --> 03:06.622
you're powerful
and it's glorious.

03:06.656 --> 03:08.390
When you're changing,
you're hunched over

03:08.425 --> 03:09.926
and cowering, like an animal.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.227
Animals don't wear clothes, Nick.

03:11.261 --> 03:12.829
All I'm saying is I need my space.

03:12.863 --> 03:14.897
True intimacy. Embrace that.

03:14.932 --> 03:18.300
Abby and I, we have one sponge.

03:18.335 --> 03:21.670
And we use it for everything.

03:21.705 --> 03:24.716
I don't like that,
but you seem happy.

03:24.816 --> 03:28.276
Don't hold back, Nick. Expose
your cracks and love will fill them.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.978
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

03:30.012 --> 03:31.747
Do you know how hard
it's been for me to take

03:31.781 --> 03:33.615
this conversation seriously
while you're wearing

03:33.649 --> 03:36.618
- that thing around your neck?
- It's an Iroquois throat band.

03:36.652 --> 03:38.953
- That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
- Yeah, you're jealous.

03:38.987 --> 03:41.455
- No, I'm not.
- It's not just a choker, it's story.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.324
What's the story?
She didn't have enough supplies?

03:44.359 --> 03:46.360
- I'm not through the whole thing yet.
- I got to tell you, man, looking

03:46.394 --> 03:48.495
at that thing,
the sex must be awesome.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.165
Coach: <i>Cece and I have been
hanging out a lot more lately.</i>

03:51.199 --> 03:53.134
She sort of treats me like I'm
one of her girl friends, and...

03:53.168 --> 03:55.101
(strained):
You don't like it?

03:55.136 --> 03:56.569
I love it. I mean,

03:56.603 --> 03:57.937
usually, when I'm friends
with a girl, I'm either trying

03:57.972 --> 03:59.939
to get that butt or she's trying
to get this butt.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.941
But with Cece,
it's not about the butt.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.778
(chuckles) It's not about
the butt, man. It's cool.

04:04.812 --> 04:08.478
- It's like... We're like... sisters.
- What?

04:08.648 --> 04:10.783
Coach. Hey, do you have,
uh, Schmidt's keys?

04:10.817 --> 04:12.450
Kind of got a weird favor to ask.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.887
It's only weird
if you don't ask, girl. (laughs)

04:14.921 --> 04:17.656
- What?
- That's what I'm talking about.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.190
(meows)

04:19.225 --> 04:21.526
(grunts) You know
I'm doing this for you, right?

04:21.560 --> 04:23.162
- Somewhere...
- This is great.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.663
(chuckles)
What are we doing?

04:24.697 --> 04:26.664
We are snooping on Abby.

04:26.698 --> 04:29.400
- Oh, love it.
- I do not trust that girl.

04:29.434 --> 04:32.036
She's always working an angle.
Now she's got Schmidt all

04:32.070 --> 04:33.871
wrapped up, giving her money
for "jewelry."

04:33.906 --> 04:36.974
Treachery!
(Coach screams)

04:37.009 --> 04:39.376
First, they came for my
silverware and I said nothing.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.978
- What's up, dawg?
- What are you guys doing here?

04:42.013 --> 04:44.815
Schmidt, I know that Abby is fun
and she is charming,

04:44.849 --> 04:46.983
but I'm telling you, she's bad news.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.852
Is that why you guys are sorting
through my garbage?

04:48.886 --> 04:51.754
I appreciate the concern, you
guys, but Abby has changed.

04:51.789 --> 04:54.490
Coach: Then how do you explain this?

04:54.525 --> 04:56.092
I put my coffee grounds
in a plastic bag

04:56.127 --> 04:57.694
so it doesn't get the rest
of my trash dirty.

04:57.728 --> 04:58.861
- Really?
- Yeah, he does that.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.196
You got clean-ass trash, man.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.865
I don't even need gloves for this.

05:02.899 --> 05:04.766
Quit sorting through my trash, Coach.
You're messing it all up.

05:04.801 --> 05:08.170
Schmidt, you've known this girl
for a couple weeks, okay?

05:08.205 --> 05:11.106
I've known her for 20 years,
and, I am telling you,

05:11.141 --> 05:14.209
she's not to be trusted.

05:14.243 --> 05:16.544
Your words are changing his
opinions about things.

05:16.578 --> 05:17.946
(chuckles)
Up top.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.614
Mm.

05:20.649 --> 05:22.383
You two as friends is a real bummer.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.018
I'm not into it.

05:24.053 --> 05:26.354
Jess: <i>Our first night living together.</i>

05:26.388 --> 05:27.555
I'm just excited.

05:27.589 --> 05:32.159
Expose your cracks
and love will fill them.

05:34.229 --> 05:35.762
I'm changing.

05:35.796 --> 05:37.597
Great. I'm reading.

05:37.631 --> 05:40.033
Okay.

05:40.068 --> 05:42.469
Yeah, I'm just gonna
take my pants off.

05:42.503 --> 05:43.470
Okay.

05:43.504 --> 05:44.905
(grumbling)

05:44.939 --> 05:46.873
You know, I've seen you
naked before, right?

05:48.141 --> 05:49.441
What's going on there?

05:49.476 --> 05:51.543
Oh! Never changed in
front of a woman.

05:51.578 --> 05:54.446
- You know, mostly you just hook up and...
- Really?

05:54.481 --> 05:55.581
Are you serious?

05:58.986 --> 06:01.820
All right, I'm gonna read.

06:01.855 --> 06:03.188
(clears throat)

06:04.623 --> 06:07.192
Okay. Here we go.

06:09.195 --> 06:10.762
(Nick moans)

06:10.796 --> 06:12.063
Yeah, it's...

06:12.098 --> 06:13.498
Just gonna put this on here.

06:13.532 --> 06:15.267
What is that?

06:15.301 --> 06:16.935
Oh, this is my long shirt.

06:16.969 --> 06:18.936
- (snorts)
- Yeah. Oh.

06:18.938 --> 06:21.338
That's why you're laughing.
I had it on the wrong way.

06:21.373 --> 06:25.575
(laughs) That must have been
funny-looking the way it was.

06:25.610 --> 06:28.078
I've never broken it out
before you because, you know,

06:28.113 --> 06:29.746
we didn't live
together, but...

06:29.781 --> 06:33.517
it keeps the top really warm
and lets my bottom breathe.

06:33.551 --> 06:36.585
- And so... yeah.
- Why does your bottom need to breathe?

06:36.620 --> 06:39.155
Well, it's like a plant.

06:39.189 --> 06:40.924
Needs sun and air to survive.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.926
Never mind. Um... I like it.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.994
- Um... yeah.
- Great.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.262
I like it.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.998
(grunts)

06:49.033 --> 06:50.799
Okay.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.634
- This is great.
- This is great.

06:52.668 --> 06:54.102
I'm excited.

06:54.137 --> 06:56.238
Me, too.

07:01.877 --> 07:03.678
- What are you doing to the pillow?
- I'm trying to get comfortable.

07:03.712 --> 07:05.513
Oh, okay.

07:05.548 --> 07:07.514
Got it.

07:07.549 --> 07:09.350
Got it.

07:09.384 --> 07:10.952
I can't...

07:10.986 --> 07:12.320
I'm gonna go to sleep.

07:12.354 --> 07:14.322
- Turn off the light.
- Great.

07:14.356 --> 07:16.357
Mm.

07:17.392 --> 07:19.026
Ow!

07:19.061 --> 07:21.362
What? So-Sorry. Sorry.

07:21.396 --> 07:24.064
- What the hell is that nightmare?
- I just... have to...

07:24.098 --> 07:26.433
Sorry.

07:28.269 --> 07:30.170
- Just reading.
- Yeah. You know what I'm gonna do?

07:30.204 --> 07:31.458
I'm gonna sleep
with my head over there.

07:31.621 --> 07:33.539
Okay.

07:33.574 --> 07:35.575
Yeah, that's... That's
gonna be better for me.

07:44.217 --> 07:46.852
You know what, I'm gonna
get some water.

07:46.886 --> 07:48.887
(muffled music playing)

07:52.258 --> 07:54.825
- Oh, hey.
- My room looks totally different.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.160
Turned it into a workout space.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.862
I am so glad it opened up.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.564
Oh, why didn't we do this sooner?

08:02.468 --> 08:04.469
Crab walk.

08:06.405 --> 08:08.739
You don't know where
a crab's gonna go.

08:08.773 --> 08:10.207
And you know what?

08:10.241 --> 08:11.908
Where does the crab go? Oh!

08:11.942 --> 08:13.743
Oh, aah!

08:13.777 --> 08:15.312
Owie.

08:19.317 --> 08:21.118
(elevator bell dings)

08:21.152 --> 08:24.354
Hi. Just enjoying the peace and quiet.

08:25.322 --> 08:27.323
Whoa, hold up.

08:27.358 --> 08:28.402
Hey, Jess, what are you doing?

08:28.502 --> 08:31.794
Oh, I just, you know, sometimes
I work in the elevator now.

08:31.828 --> 08:34.230
(whispers): You know,
helping some of the older residents.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.898
Hmm?
(elevator bell dings)

08:35.932 --> 08:38.933
(loudly):
This is your floor, ma'am.

08:42.572 --> 08:45.006
So, how are things going with
you and Schmidt living together?

08:45.041 --> 08:48.076
I have never felt so clean
while being so dirty.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.546
- Awesome.
- Last night, Schmidt wanted

08:50.580 --> 08:52.847
to take me to a hotel, but
we could not even get out

08:52.882 --> 08:55.149
of the loft without ripping
each other's clothes off.

08:55.184 --> 08:56.334
Oh, that's our thing, too.

08:56.486 --> 08:58.819
We have the hotel until tomorrow
night and it's all paid up.

08:58.853 --> 09:00.854
You guys might as well use it.
Take it off our hands.

09:00.889 --> 09:02.356
(elevator bell dings)

09:03.725 --> 09:05.059
Lobby, please.

09:05.093 --> 09:07.094
(mouths words)

09:10.097 --> 09:13.066
Wait, I forgot Bernie.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.068
Hold the elevator.

09:15.102 --> 09:19.105
Bernie, Bernie,
where are you, you idiot?

09:19.139 --> 09:20.840
I'll just be here, waiting.

09:20.874 --> 09:23.577
Winston: <i>So, Nick, the police academy
training is going well, but</i>

09:23.611 --> 09:26.845
I'm a little worried about
the rings, because of the...

09:26.879 --> 09:29.248
you know... the incident.

09:29.282 --> 09:30.782
(laughter)

09:30.817 --> 09:32.451
Shut up, you guys,
I can do this.

09:32.485 --> 09:34.986
No, Miller, no, Miller, no!

09:35.021 --> 09:37.356
(laughter)

09:38.658 --> 09:40.359
(laughs)

09:42.228 --> 09:44.795
I'm sor... I got big laughs. You got
to give the people what they want.

09:44.830 --> 09:48.299
Everybody saw my ding-a-ling,
Nick. My ding-a-ling.

09:48.334 --> 09:50.268
I've got an issue that's
more important than this.

09:50.302 --> 09:53.605
Ever since Jess moved in, I
haven't had a second to myself.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.873
You see what she's done
to my writer's desk?

09:55.907 --> 09:57.874
It's like an arts and
crafts area now, man.

09:57.908 --> 09:59.109
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

09:59.143 --> 10:01.245
I'm staying at a hotel tonight.

10:01.279 --> 10:02.879
Not alone. With other people.

10:02.913 --> 10:05.815
I have to chaperone a field trip
to Sacramento, so...

10:05.850 --> 10:07.718
You know what, you seem too
busy to talk about it. Go, go.

10:07.752 --> 10:09.919
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

10:09.954 --> 10:11.421
Wait, weren't you
just saying how you...

10:11.456 --> 10:13.322
Whoa, dude!
(Jess laughs)

10:13.357 --> 10:15.491
- Good one, Nick. Bye.
- Bye, yeah.

10:15.525 --> 10:18.060
That, uh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

10:18.094 --> 10:19.495
Schmidt:
I can't believe I let you guys

10:19.529 --> 10:21.597
talk me into tailing
my own girlfriend.

10:21.632 --> 10:24.099
Cece: Look at this neighborhood,
Schmidt, she is up to no good.

10:24.134 --> 10:26.835
I feel very uncomfortable
being here, I trust Abby,

10:26.870 --> 10:28.471
I don't want to spy
on her any more, okay?

10:28.505 --> 10:31.005
We're not spying.
We're just carefully watching.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.574
Girlfriend is going down.

10:32.608 --> 10:35.310
- Yeah, she is.
- Let us bust her, buster.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.811
(giggles)
That was a good one.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.413
That was.
Yeah. Okay.

10:38.447 --> 10:40.348
(both sigh)

10:40.448 --> 10:42.950
This dynamic between the two of you...
It's very annoying to me.

10:42.985 --> 10:45.119
- I'm sure I'm not alone on this.
- Hi, hater.

10:45.154 --> 10:47.354
- Bye, hater. - Okay, enough is enough.
I'm getting out of here.

10:47.389 --> 10:48.989
- Hey, it's my car...
- Guys, guys.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.124
I don't care whose
car it is, I'm going.

10:51.159 --> 10:52.426
- I don't care who...
- It's my car.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.161
- Oh.
- Aah!

10:54.195 --> 10:56.797
(gasps)
Great.

10:56.831 --> 10:58.332
Hit a parked car
in the same neighborhood

10:58.366 --> 11:00.501
they shot friggin' <i>Children of Men.</i>

11:08.642 --> 11:10.443
Yeah!

11:10.477 --> 11:13.979
I'm alone!

11:14.014 --> 11:16.048
(laughs)

11:16.082 --> 11:17.382
Yeah.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.384

I'm alone and I love it.

11:40.772 --> 11:42.206
You know what
I'm talking about, girl.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.711
(sobs)

11:46.745 --> 11:50.647
Do you have anything
in the Byzantine Era?

11:50.681 --> 11:54.917

- Which ding is ours?

12:10.266 --> 12:12.601
Coach, there are
knife holes in the door.

12:12.635 --> 12:14.128
What does it matter?
Let's get out of here.

12:14.218 --> 12:16.505
At least write "sorry" and put it under
the windshield wiper...

12:16.539 --> 12:17.840
There are none.

12:17.874 --> 12:21.276
Uh... Maybe put it under
the dead bird's leg?

- Son of a bitch

12:26.114 --> 12:27.448
Hobo.

12:27.483 --> 12:28.483
Thank you, Jingles.

12:28.517 --> 12:29.884
You got it, girl.

12:29.918 --> 12:31.452
Hey. What are
you guys doing here?

12:31.487 --> 12:32.953
Tailing me?

12:32.988 --> 12:35.222
- No. Um...
- Yes, we're tailing you.

12:35.257 --> 12:37.358
I know how you work:

12:37.392 --> 12:39.693
You glom onto guys and
then you just bleed them dry.

12:39.727 --> 12:41.728
Well, you are not
gonna do it to Schmidt.

12:44.565 --> 12:46.232
What's in the box?

12:49.103 --> 12:50.771
Tell us what's in the box.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.775
Zippers.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.109
What?

12:57.143 --> 13:00.312
(laughs) Z... Zippers, you guys.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.747
Guy up there'll
give you a great deal.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.882
He also loves crack.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.284
Can we go now?

13:05.318 --> 13:06.519
Thank you, Abby, let's go.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.088
My car is gone.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.458
Well, that's not surprising.

13:17.202 --> 13:19.136
Oh, you can do this.
You can do this, Winnie.

13:25.409 --> 13:27.844
What are you doing here?

13:27.878 --> 13:29.312
On a school day?

13:29.347 --> 13:31.381
I see this means
you're the cutting type.

13:31.415 --> 13:34.150
Which means you're the pantsing type.

13:34.184 --> 13:36.118
Well, I got news for you, buddy.

13:36.153 --> 13:37.153
You ain't getting 'em!

13:37.187 --> 13:38.220
Not today.

13:38.254 --> 13:40.188
How 'bout I take your pants, huh?

13:40.223 --> 13:41.957
Not like that, everybody!

13:41.991 --> 13:43.692
I'm not trying to take
the little kid's pants.

13:43.727 --> 13:45.361
He's trying to take my pants.

13:45.395 --> 13:47.396
You see how he's eyeing my pants?

13:47.430 --> 13:48.797
So I eyed his pants...

13:48.832 --> 13:50.532
You know what?

13:50.567 --> 13:51.900
You win.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.335
You win, you little son of a bitch.

13:53.369 --> 13:55.202
You win!

13:55.237 --> 13:57.405
I don't want to tell you
how to police your beach,

13:57.439 --> 13:59.173
but right now there are truants

13:59.207 --> 14:01.476
outside of this hotel,
stirring up trouble.

14:01.510 --> 14:03.143
Hey, yo, lookin' good, Charlie!

14:03.178 --> 14:06.113
Debbie, see you at 1:00
on the massage table.

14:07.449 --> 14:08.716
Winston.

14:15.490 --> 14:16.923
Mm.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.992
We are gonna sneak into Schmidt's

14:19.026 --> 14:20.761
and see what's really
inside those boxes.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.596
- Cece, darling...
- Hmm?

14:22.630 --> 14:24.698
- What?
- How long have we been friends?

14:24.732 --> 14:26.164
A week or so?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.401
- And have I ever steered you wrong?
- Well, no...

14:28.435 --> 14:31.003
Exactly. Because I know you
better than anyone, girl.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.237
And you're acting like a lunatic.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.774
I mean, the kind of lunatic
other lunatics look at and go,

14:34.808 --> 14:35.941
"Oh, my God,
that bitch a lunatic."

14:35.975 --> 14:38.711
So I'm gonna need you
to figure out why you're

14:38.745 --> 14:39.912
really doing all this for Schmidt...

14:42.381 --> 14:45.617
...and then sort it out.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.852
You did not just say that to me.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.421
Think about it, girl.
Shoot...

14:49.455 --> 14:51.756
Just to be clear, I did not ask
you to act like this, okay?

14:51.791 --> 14:54.977
- It's just kind of fun to do...
- Slow down, girl.

14:55.961 --> 14:56.711
You gonna eat that scone?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.333
- Damn it.
- Slow down.

14:58.383 --> 15:00.964
Are you-are you gonna have this scone?

15:00.998 --> 15:03.233
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.636
Just looking at my Garbage Pail Kids.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.971
Jess makes me put 'em in a box.

15:08.005 --> 15:10.441
How are you gonna put art
like this in a box?

15:11.943 --> 15:12.910
What's going on with you?

15:12.944 --> 15:14.610
Nothing...

15:14.645 --> 15:16.111
You will not tell Nick

15:16.146 --> 15:17.880
that you saw me here
because then he'll get upset

15:17.915 --> 15:19.715
and I'm gonna have to move
into my old room,

15:19.750 --> 15:22.919
and that means that we suck as
a couple and that Abby was right

15:22.953 --> 15:24.754
and I cannot let that happen.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.489
Jess went to a hotel
because sharing a room with you

15:26.523 --> 15:27.690
is driving her crazy.

15:28.592 --> 15:31.192
(relieved moaning)

15:31.226 --> 15:33.127
Dude, at really was
a tough one to keep in,

15:33.162 --> 15:34.295
but, honestly,
I held my own and I did

15:34.330 --> 15:36.297
- my best.
- Are you kidding me?!

15:36.332 --> 15:39.267
I can't believe it!
I changed in front of her!

15:39.301 --> 15:40.936
Sharing a room
is driving you crazy, too.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.938
But I didn't lie about it.

15:42.972 --> 15:46.474
I never get to win these things.

15:46.508 --> 15:48.108
So, anyway, I just want
to apologize.

15:48.142 --> 15:50.444
It was wrong of me to get involved.

15:50.479 --> 15:53.080
Are you sure you don't want to tap
Abby's phone? Run a DNA sample?

15:53.114 --> 15:55.950
I don't want to be coarse, but
the bedroom is covered in it.

15:55.984 --> 15:57.785
I was worried about you, okay?

15:57.819 --> 15:59.453
I didn't want her
to take advantage of you

15:59.488 --> 16:01.455
'cause I know that you will do...

16:01.489 --> 16:04.156
anything for the people
that you care about.

16:05.826 --> 16:09.295
Well, I guess I could say
the same thing about you.

16:11.098 --> 16:13.800
And, you know what,
maybe Abby has changed.

16:13.834 --> 16:17.136
I'm thinking about helping Abby
lease a storefront

16:17.170 --> 16:18.971
- for her jewelry.
- Is that crazy?

16:19.005 --> 16:21.807
- It's...
- (chuckles)

16:21.841 --> 16:23.775
It's amazing. Don't hold back.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.978
Here. Here, I want you
to have this.

16:26.012 --> 16:28.446
- Oh.
- Abby made it.

16:28.481 --> 16:29.681
Oh...

16:29.716 --> 16:30.849
Mm...

16:30.884 --> 16:33.284
It's a cough
drop and...

16:33.319 --> 16:35.520
- these are hard candies.
- I see that.

16:35.554 --> 16:38.923
I... truly hate it.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.591
You're welcome.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.693
(sighs)

16:42.728 --> 16:43.618
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.

16:43.995 --> 16:45.011
How was Sacramento?

16:45.051 --> 16:47.547
It was great. The kids cried
when they saw the capital.

16:47.713 --> 16:49.609
Oh, did they?
How many students showed up?

16:49.644 --> 16:50.579
30.

16:50.668 --> 16:53.003
- What hotel did you stay at?
- Old Sacramento Inn.

16:53.037 --> 16:54.504
- What room did you stay in?
- 523.

16:54.539 --> 16:56.006
- What floor was that on?
- Five.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.008
- Was there an elevator to the 4th floor?
- 5th floor.

16:58.042 --> 16:59.442
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.645
- You don't smoke.
- In Sacramento, I do.

17:01.679 --> 17:02.979
- What'd you have for breakfast?
- Continental.

17:03.014 --> 17:04.814
How are you this good
at lying?! I know

17:04.848 --> 17:06.949
you're making this all up!
I know you didn't go

17:06.983 --> 17:09.617
to Sacramento. I know you went
to a hotel to be by yourself.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.155
- Damn it, Winston!
- Nick loved being alone, too!

17:13.189 --> 17:16.025
- Damn it, Winston!
- That's for my ding-a-ling!

17:16.059 --> 17:18.009
You didn't like living
together either?

17:18.178 --> 17:21.630
No, but it was your idea, and
it seemed like the thing to do.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.165
But at least I didn't lie
about it, Jess.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.367
Okay, I did!
But you were driving me crazy.

17:26.402 --> 17:28.136
(quietly):
You wear a nightgown.

17:28.171 --> 17:29.504
Are you talking about my long shirt?

17:29.539 --> 17:31.906
You look like the Little Match Girl,

17:31.941 --> 17:37.045
wandering around Victorian England
selling matches for a penny.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.681
- I look like George Washington.
- I was just trying to be a good couple.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.028
Schmidt and Abby are doing it.

17:42.048 --> 17:45.319
Well, Schmidt and Abby are crazy.
They're doing a lot of things.

17:45.353 --> 17:47.588
Why can't we do this?

17:47.622 --> 17:49.590
I don't know.

17:53.428 --> 17:54.506
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:54.669 --> 17:57.230
Uh-oh. Last time
I saw you day-drinking

17:57.264 --> 17:59.265
was when you got kicked out
of jazz ensemble.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.102
I'm still pissed off about that.

18:02.136 --> 18:04.102
What does that mean,
"too enthusiastic"?

18:04.389 --> 18:07.507
How come you're not at the hotel?
Did you and Nick break the bed?

18:07.541 --> 18:09.875
Because, legally, they cannot
make you pay for that.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.076
No. I was by myself.

18:11.111 --> 18:13.912
Oh, I've broken the bed
by myself.

18:13.946 --> 18:15.547
Big-time.

18:15.582 --> 18:18.717
No, I went to the hotel
to get away from Nick.

18:18.751 --> 18:21.920
And I wore a robe and I watched
a documentary about Ethel Kennedy

18:21.954 --> 18:24.389
and it was one
of the best nights of my life.

18:24.424 --> 18:26.091
- So you win.
- Your relationship's

18:26.125 --> 18:29.360
better than mine. And I can't
even share a room with Nick.

18:29.394 --> 18:31.095
I don't win. Come on.

18:31.130 --> 18:33.531
I swing from guy to guy.

18:33.565 --> 18:36.467
I don't think
I have ever paid my own rent.

18:36.502 --> 18:38.769
You travel the world,
collecting lovers.

18:38.803 --> 18:41.539
All my lovers
could fit in one SUV.

18:41.573 --> 18:44.374
And, yes, maybe somebody would
have to sit on someone's lap,

18:44.408 --> 18:46.376
but they would fit.

18:46.410 --> 18:48.278
And you're just... brave.

18:48.312 --> 18:50.113
You and Nick are brave.

18:50.148 --> 18:52.415
You guys know each other,
you get under each other's skin.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.584
He has the feet
of a hippy cult leader.

18:54.619 --> 18:56.786
But that's the difference.
I just throw myself

18:56.820 --> 18:59.421
into whatever comes along
because...

18:59.456 --> 19:02.158
I really don't want to be alone.

19:02.192 --> 19:04.426
Why not? Being alone's great.

19:04.461 --> 19:06.262
You should try it sometime.

19:06.296 --> 19:08.497
Seriously. It might help you
figure yourself out.

19:08.532 --> 19:10.766
(sighs)

19:10.800 --> 19:12.601
You're Abby Freaking Day.

19:12.636 --> 19:14.602
You can do whatever you want.

19:16.272 --> 19:17.605
Except vote.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.607
(laughs)
But, seriously,

19:19.642 --> 19:21.342
you should've seen Nick's feet.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.845
The bottoms are all black,
except for one patch of yellow.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.047
(laughs)

19:29.988 --> 19:30.977
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:30.997 --> 19:31.750
- What are you doing?
- Oh,

19:32.257 --> 19:34.391
just packing up your things
and then I...

19:34.426 --> 19:36.960
thought about what you would
want and how you probably didn't

19:36.995 --> 19:39.963
want to move again, so I decided
to do the right thing

19:39.998 --> 19:41.298
and just take your room.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.866
- My room's bigger.
- Is it? I never...

19:42.900 --> 19:44.935
- Nice try.
- All right.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.302
I got to move some stuff back then.

19:46.337 --> 19:47.870
- (chuckles)
- Hey.

19:47.904 --> 19:50.440
I'm sorry that this didn't work out.

19:50.474 --> 19:54.043
- I'm sorry that we sucked.
- Look, we don't suck.

19:54.077 --> 19:56.812
I'm crazy about you, but I don't
have to spend every second

19:56.847 --> 19:59.982
with you in what amounts
to a one-room log cabin.

20:00.017 --> 20:02.050
Cabins are what drove
the Pilgrims crazy. That's why

20:02.084 --> 20:04.553
they killed each other
at the Plymouth Rock Massacre.

20:04.587 --> 20:07.956
- That's not a real thing.
- So how did the millions of Pilgrims die?

20:07.990 --> 20:10.159
There definitely weren't
millions of Pilgrims.

20:10.193 --> 20:13.061
Then how do you explain
my 37-page essay about it?

20:13.095 --> 20:15.297
- I think you made it up in your head.
- This seems like one of those

20:15.331 --> 20:18.065
- "agree to disagree" moments...
- No. It's not.

20:18.099 --> 20:20.034
- I'm also older than you.
- Anyway,

20:20.068 --> 20:22.303
I love you and someday
we'll make this work.

20:22.337 --> 20:24.071
I think so, too.
Just-just not now.

20:24.105 --> 20:26.073
- Not like this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:26.107 --> 20:28.576
But if you're not doing
anything, want to come over?

20:28.610 --> 20:29.610
I am over.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.745
(knocking)

20:31.780 --> 20:33.513
- Oh!
- Hey, guys. Uh,

20:33.548 --> 20:35.748
just a little hot goss
from apartment 4C.

20:35.783 --> 20:37.850
Abby's gone.

20:37.885 --> 20:39.286
- What?
- She's gonna

20:39.320 --> 20:40.786
stay with your mom for a little bit.

20:40.820 --> 20:44.623
Something about saving up
to be independent?

20:44.658 --> 20:46.024
Wow.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.294
Good for her.

20:48.328 --> 20:50.296
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. You know...

20:50.330 --> 20:53.131
in hindsight, maybe we moved
a little bit too fast.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.133
I just wish
that I had realized that

20:55.168 --> 20:58.869
- before I rented her a storefront.
- You rented her a storefront?

20:58.904 --> 21:00.871
It was a three-year lease
in an undesirable neighborhood.

21:00.906 --> 21:03.308
(chuckles) It totally
obliterated my bank account,

21:03.342 --> 21:05.710
so... I've decided
to sublet my place, and...

21:05.744 --> 21:08.112
I'll be moving back here,
under duress.

21:08.146 --> 21:09.703
Y-You're moving back in here?

21:09.733 --> 21:11.049
Well, it shouldn't be
a problem, right? I mean,

21:11.317 --> 21:14.218
Coach is in my room, and you
guys are now moving in together.

21:14.252 --> 21:16.453
I'll just move
into Jess' room. Cool?

21:16.487 --> 21:18.655
- Yeah, but, like...
- Asking was just kind of a formality.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.891
'Cause my name's on the lease,
so... You guys are the best.

21:21.926 --> 21:24.194
Oh...

21:24.229 --> 21:27.163
(sighs)
(chuckles)

21:27.198 --> 21:30.799
- Yay!
- Yay.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.501
- Cool.
- Great.

21:32.536 --> 21:33.876
- Let's do this.
- We can make it work.

21:33.976 --> 21:35.364
You have
to start washing your feet.
