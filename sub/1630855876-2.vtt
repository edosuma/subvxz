WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.503
(mysterious music)

00:45.179 --> 00:46.812
- No, you-you can't--
- no!

00:46.947 --> 00:48.347
(zapping)

00:49.450 --> 00:50.949
- I don't think your aunt
is sick at all.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.486
- Can you tell him
that george crabtree called?

00:54.522 --> 00:57.022
The detective and his wife
have gone missing.

00:57.925 --> 00:58.857
(julia): We have
a child at home.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.559
(mathilda): As long
as you cooperate,

01:00.628 --> 01:02.393
Your child will remain safe.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.762
(murdoch): What do you
want from us?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.363
(jones): I need to save
an innocent woman

01:05.399 --> 01:06.164
From the noose.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.301
- Hilda fanshaw.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.403
- You're convicted of your
husband's murder.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.971
- The courts believe I did.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.606
- We need to get that woman
out of jail

01:14.675 --> 01:16.374
And deal with
the consequences later.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.044
(watts): "what you
are witnessing is retribution.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.912
The deaths of robert foster

01:20.948 --> 01:22.514
And ned mcguire
have been avenged."

01:22.583 --> 01:23.482
(crabtree): Good lord.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.917
(watts): "three dead,
the next to go,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.787
The butcher, the baker
and the candlestick maker."

01:28.856 --> 01:30.522
You know what this means.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.257
- These two murders
are connected.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.260
(murdoch): What can you tell me
about this rachel wiggins?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.329
(fanshaw): She killed
my dear frederick.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.730
- She was innocent.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.332
- I don't see how that matters.
She's dead.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.467
- Forgive me.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.469
- Nothing you can do
can hurt her now.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.505
But you can help me.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.040
And your child.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.378
(brackenreid): You found him?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.479
(roberts): Yes.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.581
- Our killer is on this boat.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.616
- The young man, trevor,

01:58.652 --> 02:01.853
Seems very morose
since the murder. The trollop--

02:01.889 --> 02:02.854
(brackenreid): Fiona.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.823
- Yes, the redhead.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.058
- And what about the other two?

02:06.060 --> 02:07.159
- Penny and caroline?

02:07.228 --> 02:08.293
- The two fought constantly.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.228
- I think they're sapphists.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.496
(brackenreid): And what
about the captain?

02:11.532 --> 02:12.965
- I don't think so.
- Why?

02:13.734 --> 02:14.666
- He's the captain.

02:14.702 --> 02:18.170
(fanshaw): I should like
to propose a toast

02:18.172 --> 02:19.804
To detective william murdoch

02:19.840 --> 02:21.973
And doctor julia ogden.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.843
I am a free woman today,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.044
Thanks to them.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.213
(applause)

02:30.885 --> 02:33.084
(mysterious music)

02:36.924 --> 02:39.024
- Bloody 'ell, margaret.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.792
You best not be snooping around.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.533
Margaret?

02:49.069 --> 02:50.001
Margaret!

02:51.805 --> 02:53.071
Margaret!

02:53.974 --> 02:55.140
Margaret!

02:56.310 --> 02:57.442
Help!

02:59.513 --> 03:01.546
Help! Help!

03:08.889 --> 03:10.889
(indistinct chatter)

03:10.958 --> 03:13.225
- I know I should care about
these terrible murders,

03:13.227 --> 03:14.726
And I do, but right now,

03:14.762 --> 03:16.228
All I want to do
is find the murdochs.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.630
- I know, george.
But your job is important.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.498
- I don't care about
my job right now.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.633
- What...
(baby crying)

03:22.836 --> 03:23.969
What was that?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.370
- What was what?
- Shh.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.005
(baby crying)

03:28.842 --> 03:30.242
Oh, dear lord.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.710
Susannah. Susannah.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.846
- Oh, my goodness. Susannah.
(crying)

03:34.982 --> 03:37.716
- I know. I know.
You're all right.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.285
(breathing heavily)

03:41.555 --> 03:44.156
(fanshaw): As I said:
A woman of my word.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.925
Your child is safe.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.461
By all accounts,
she is an inquisitive

03:49.596 --> 03:51.396
Little thing.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.598
You're both very lucky people.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.135
- If she's been harmed in a--
- I can assure you she was not.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.672
- And I'm to believe a murderer?

04:00.708 --> 04:03.408
(scoffs)
- but I'm not a murderer.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.344
Rachel wiggins is.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.480
She killed my dear husband

04:08.482 --> 04:10.081
And then took her own life.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.884
You and your husband
proved that.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.888
And, as I cannot be tried
for the same crime twice,

04:17.024 --> 04:19.090
I am now a free woman.

04:19.126 --> 04:22.360
For which I thank you
most sincerely.

04:22.396 --> 04:26.131
Now go home,
before I change my mind.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.801
(soft instrumental music)

04:36.143 --> 04:38.376
(seagulls squawking)

04:40.247 --> 04:41.813
- It's a nasty blow.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.514
We need to get her up
and keep her conscious.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.649
- What do you know about it?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.652
- I trained to be a nurse
and I know people

04:46.787 --> 04:49.454
Who suffer this type of head
injury need to stay awake

04:49.456 --> 04:50.722
Or they may slip away.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.791
So, let's get her up
and into the fresh air.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.627
Gently, gently, gently.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.561
- Come on, margaret.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.662
We're going to
get you up, darling.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.997
Come on. Help us.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.198
(grunting)

05:01.001 --> 05:02.667
One of you lot did this.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.202
And when I find out
who it was...

05:04.271 --> 05:06.204
(breathing heavily)

05:08.542 --> 05:10.542
Everything's gonna be all right.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.014
(indistinct chatter)

05:18.218 --> 05:20.685
- Do you believe hilda fanshaw
killed her husband?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.888
- Yes, I do. And the maid.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.756
- I very much doubt
she killed herself.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.691
- My feeling as well.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.893
She was killed.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.695
- Under the direction
of hilda fanshaw.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.630
- William--
- I know.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.900
We can't let
what we've done stand.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.701
- We can't go to the police.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.503
We've compromised evidence.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.571
Hilda fanshaw has gotten
away with murder.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.507
- And we're
responsible for that.

05:42.642 --> 05:43.942
- Yes.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.746
(exhales deeply)
but our child is alive.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.718
- I can't let what
we've done stand.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.922
- But... We can't risk susannah.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.659
- Then we won't.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.495
(train whistle blowing)

06:08.268 --> 06:10.001
- No one saw anyone
bring susannah in?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.669
- No.
- Where is she?

06:11.705 --> 06:12.937
- She's fine. She's with effie.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.406
But still no word
on the murdochs.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.274
What do you have?
- Constable tucker

06:16.276 --> 06:18.410
Is keeping close to paul young
of young's bread.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.011
- You know, it's a shame.
I liked that place.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.213
- Yeah.
- I sent higgins to keep

06:21.348 --> 06:22.681
An eye on the butcher,
gilbert ward.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.751
- Oh, his meat packing plant
has a terrible safety record.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.820
- Do I want to hear the details?
- Ooh, likely not.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.355
I'm working on identifying
our candlestick maker,

06:31.392 --> 06:33.225
Though I haven't had
much luck yet.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.160
- A business owner
with a spotty safety record,

06:35.295 --> 06:37.162
That's for sure.
- Indeed.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.631
Apparently, young's workers
walked off the job a year ago

06:39.700 --> 06:41.432
Claiming unsafe conditions.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.767
None of them were hired back

06:42.770 --> 06:44.969
And now injuries among
the new, untrained workers

06:45.005 --> 06:47.239
Are at an all-time high.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.108
- It's shameful. And these
are the men we're protecting?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.210
- Well, they're also
the men getting killed.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.546
(phone ringing)

06:58.552 --> 07:00.118
- Inspector george crabtree.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.120
- Inspector now?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.988
Well, things certainly
have changed.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.924
- Sir!
It's sir! It's the detective!

07:06.059 --> 07:07.391
- Oh!
- Ah, sir.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.526
What a relief
to hear your voice!

07:08.595 --> 07:09.994
I have to admit I was
starting to think

07:10.030 --> 07:11.062
You and the good doctor
were dead.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.198
- Oh, no.
We are very much alive.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.734
Ah, george,

07:15.869 --> 07:18.403
Was susannah delivered
to the station house?

07:18.538 --> 07:20.338
<i> - Yes, just this morning.</i>

07:20.374 --> 07:21.940
- A-and is she all right?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.975
- Sir, picture of health.
<i> - Very good.</i>

07:23.977 --> 07:25.210
Very good. Uh, george,

07:25.212 --> 07:28.145
You mustn't let susannah
out of your sight.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.815
- Sir, no worries there.
Effie's fallen quite in love.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.619
- All right. Uh, and bethany?

07:34.621 --> 07:35.420
<i> - The nanny?</i>

07:35.489 --> 07:37.622
Uh, no sign, I'm afraid, sir.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.556
Are you coming home?

07:39.426 --> 07:40.492
- Yes, doctor ogden and I

07:40.561 --> 07:42.093
Are on our way home,

07:42.162 --> 07:44.162
But we have something
to tend to first.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.730
- Well, sir, hurry if you can.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.565
There's more than a little
trouble happening here now.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.536
(tense music)

07:54.842 --> 07:55.707
- Oh!

07:56.910 --> 07:58.043
Where am I?

07:58.178 --> 07:59.844
- Margaret, you'll be all right.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.179
- You suffered
a blow to the head.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.714
- Oh.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.182
- Did you see what happened?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.586
- They came at me from behind.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.258
The redhead saw me
go into the cabin.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.993
- You need to let her rest, sir.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.194
(margaret sighs)

08:17.130 --> 08:19.531
- Oi!
- We'll talk later.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.732
- What do you know about this?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.733
- What? Nothing.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.402
- My wife said you were
watching her.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.138
- Is that a crime?
- Why?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.873
- I wanted to know
what she was doing

08:28.909 --> 08:30.942
Snooping around
my husband's cabin.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.810
- Your husband?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.211
- You seem surprised.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.481
- I would say so, the way that
you two have been carrying on.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.749
- Oh! And you find
that shocking?

08:38.785 --> 08:40.652
- I was a police inspector,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.687
Very little shocks me anymore.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.558
- My husband and I are what
some people call libertines.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.827
- Ah, they have a name
for it now, do they?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.096
- Mm. In truth,
it's a convenient arrangement

08:51.231 --> 08:52.830
For both of us.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.499
Being together suits us,

08:54.634 --> 08:57.168
But it does not complete us.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.471
Monogamy is a very dull state,
wouldn't you say?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.507
- No, I would not.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.376
- Mm.
Then you're cheating yourself.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.579
The world is a banquet

09:07.581 --> 09:11.049
And both charles and I
indulged ourselves.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.118
- For a woman who's just lost
her husband,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.987
No matter what the arrangement,

09:16.122 --> 09:17.656
You don't seem very affected.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.656
- Oh, I am.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.459
I will miss charles terribly.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.561
Despite his faults.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.597
- Why the secret?

09:27.334 --> 09:30.268
- I get much luckier
when I pretend that I'm single.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.104
Imagine how it's going to be
now that I'm a widow.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.907
- You, madam, are arctic cold.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.610
- Hm. I assure you, sir,

09:38.612 --> 09:41.579
I am the furthest thing
from the arctic.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.814
Come with me.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.950
- Where?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.284
- To the equator.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.254
Ha! I jest.
(chuckling)

09:50.290 --> 09:52.624
My late husband's cabin.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.226
I want to show you
something. Hm.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.433
(ominous music)

10:10.377 --> 10:12.377
- You do not have to be here!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.446
You are wasting
your time and mine.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.449
- We believe you may be
on the killer's list.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.050
- Why would someone be after me?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.253
- You run an unsafe business,
according to him.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.888
- Unsafe?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.723
That's ridiculous!

10:25.759 --> 10:28.326
It's not my problem half
the workers here are idiots.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.261
- Be that as it may,

10:30.297 --> 10:33.064
I've been told to place you
under police protection.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.266
- This is my protection.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.803
Much more effective than you,
I'd wager.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.140
- I'm just trying
to do my job, sir.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.677
- Well, if I'm going to be
burdened with your presence,

10:45.679 --> 10:47.812
You can make yourself useful.
Come on.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.349
Give me a hand with this.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.886
- Oh, really?
- It'll just take a moment.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.120
(sighs)

10:57.090 --> 10:58.690
(grunting)

10:58.759 --> 11:00.024
Hey!

11:02.829 --> 11:04.028
No one's supposed to be here.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.997
- Well, the door didn't
close by itself. Hey!

11:05.999 --> 11:08.466
Open up! Police! Open up.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.400
(banging)

11:09.403 --> 11:11.102
(ward): Hey, let us out!

11:11.104 --> 11:13.904
- Open up! Police.
- Open up! Let us out!

11:13.940 --> 11:15.173
(banging)

11:15.242 --> 11:17.108
- Open up right now! Police!
- Hey!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.177
Open up!
- Police. Open up!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.646
(ominous music)

11:23.150 --> 11:24.782
- Are you sure
about this, william?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.451
- We need to be able
to live with ourselves.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.919
And for that to happen,

11:27.988 --> 11:29.988
She cannot go unpunished
for what she's done.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.456
- You're right.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.194
- Bring it 'round to the front.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.129
(engine starts)

11:41.768 --> 11:43.868
(tense music)

11:45.872 --> 11:47.405
(door creaks)

11:48.675 --> 11:50.942
(suspenseful music)

11:55.949 --> 11:57.482
(snoring)

12:32.118 --> 12:33.384
Psst.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.652
(grunts)

12:48.401 --> 12:50.334
- What on earth do you
think you're doing?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.805
- My job. Up.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.678
- You can't do this.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.881
- Let's go, julia.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.483
- Wherever we're going,
my men will find us.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.717
- Get in.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.493
(engine starting)

13:15.628 --> 13:17.729
(jones): They have mrs. Fanshaw!
Stop them!

13:20.167 --> 13:22.767
(gunshots)

13:24.971 --> 13:26.103
Tell our friends in toronto

13:26.173 --> 13:27.772
That they have taken
mrs. Fanshaw.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.518
(fiona grunting)

13:41.288 --> 13:43.588
(fiona): Uh! It's-- ah!

13:43.657 --> 13:46.190
Oh! It's wedged
in there pretty tight.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.327
- Do you need a hand?
- No. No, I think I have it.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.728
(grunting)

13:51.298 --> 13:52.397
Oh!

13:52.532 --> 13:54.866
Not the time or the place,
inspector,

13:54.868 --> 13:57.068
But I'm sure that
could be arranged.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.873
Okay. Ah...

14:03.043 --> 14:04.742
Darn.
- What's wrong?

14:04.811 --> 14:08.947
- Well, charles always
travelled with money.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.949
There was at least
$10,000 in there.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.351
- Who else knew about that?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.754
- Only me. Or so I thought.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.290
Although charles did mention

14:19.326 --> 14:22.093
That trevor was badgering him
after that incident

14:22.162 --> 14:23.361
During the card game.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.430
Perhaps he caught wind
of the money somehow.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.232
(sighs)

14:28.235 --> 14:30.435
Charles did have
a tendency to brag.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.373
- Nothing untoward
at the bakery.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.708
Constable paul is there now.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.576
Want some?

14:39.613 --> 14:42.179
- Do you know how many workers
were injured making that?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.383
- Mr. Young insists
he runs a safe operation.

14:45.452 --> 14:49.320
- The list of people maimed
at his factory belies that.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.056
- I don't know what to tell you.

14:52.825 --> 14:53.624
- Mr. Young's a liar.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.092
Three people
died there last year.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.328
- And so I throw this bread out
and that all goes away, right?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.829
- All right, that's it.
Tucker, that's enough.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.403
Let's hope higgins
has come up with something.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.473
(panting)

15:12.612 --> 15:14.145
- Save your strength.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.415
There won't be anyone here
'til tomorrow.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.420
I can't believe I'm going
to die in this damn place.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.822
- We are not going
to die in here.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.791
- Oh, we are.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.760
- Someone deliberately closed
this door, didn't they?

15:29.829 --> 15:31.996
- It wouldn't have
closed by itself.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.232
- And there's no other way
out of here, is there?

15:35.302 --> 15:38.235
- Are you thick? Of course not.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.675
You know, I'm not a monster.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.445
I'm just trying
to run a business.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.783
People don't want to work here,
I'm not forcing them.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.584
- Well, you could have treated
your workers better.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
If you had done that,
we wouldn't be here.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.855
(ward sighs)
- I'm their boss.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.459
Not their benefactor.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.095
People want a free ride;
they're not getting it from me.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.064
(banging)
- open up!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
(sighs)

16:10.203 --> 16:12.536
(soft instrumental music)

16:15.342 --> 16:16.741
(trevor): What are you
talking about?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.342
(brackenreid): The dead man
was carrying a considerable

16:18.411 --> 16:20.745
Amount of money.
Now it's gone.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.213
- Well, I didn't take it.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.548
Look in my cabin all you want.
How much?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.283
- That's none of your business.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.818
- Look, sir,

16:27.887 --> 16:30.755
I need to get home.
My mother is ailing.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.491
- He pointed a gun at ya.
He humiliated you.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.628
- My life has been
a series of humiliations.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.297
Everything I've ever done
has turned to dust.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.032
And now I get to go home

16:42.068 --> 16:44.368
And tell my dying mother
that I am a failure.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.504
- So, you could use
some stolen money.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.005
- And I am telling you

16:48.074 --> 16:49.907
That I had nothing to do
with any of it.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.242
(footsteps approaching)

16:51.244 --> 16:52.710
Is that all?

16:52.712 --> 16:53.844
- For now.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.449
- He's not the only one
that needs to get back.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.117
This line has a schedule
to keep.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.318
With one ship
out of commission--

17:01.320 --> 17:02.520
- If we go back,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.688
I'll have to throw the lot
of you in jail when we dock.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.225
- Certainly, you don't mean me.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.393
- You were on this ship
when the murder happened.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.063
That captain's hat doesn't
excuse you from suspicion.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.531
- I had nothing to do with this.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.766
- And, apparently,
neither did anybody else!

17:15.769 --> 17:17.267
But somebody on this boat did.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.670
Now, I don't care how many
bloody days and nights

17:19.739 --> 17:21.439
We sit here in the water,

17:21.574 --> 17:23.274
I'm going to find out
who it was.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.286
(indistinct chatter)

17:36.556 --> 17:38.822
(murdoch): See that a guard
is posted at all times.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.424
- I have been forcibly

17:40.493 --> 17:42.426
Abducted by these two.
I demand--

17:42.429 --> 17:44.795
- You would be well advised
to stay quiet.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.965
- I insist on calling
my lawyer, immediately.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.067
- Mrs. Fanshaw...

17:50.103 --> 17:51.602
Your concerns are not ours.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.503
(crabtree): Sir!

17:52.638 --> 17:55.038
- George!
(laughing)

17:55.075 --> 17:56.641
- Good to see you, sir.
Doctor!

17:56.643 --> 17:58.075
I'm so relieved
to know you're safe.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.677
- Thank you, george.
Where is susannah?

17:59.812 --> 18:00.745
- Right this way.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.179
(susannah crying)

18:02.215 --> 18:03.280
- Ah.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.785
Susannah.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.721
I'm so sorry to have left you.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.424
(susannah crying)

18:13.426 --> 18:15.125
- Thank you so much.

18:15.161 --> 18:18.162
- My pleasure.
She's an impetuous little imp.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.733
- So, sir, you were captured
by that old lady?

18:22.802 --> 18:25.469
- Oh, she is much more
dangerous than she appears.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.437
- Oh.
- Are you still

18:27.474 --> 18:28.939
Acting inspector, george?

18:28.975 --> 18:31.742
- I am, sir. Until inspector
brackenreid returns.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.510
You should know, sir,
that he left England

18:33.546 --> 18:35.713
The minute he found out yourself
and the doctor were missing.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.950
- Oh, I see.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.285
Uh, well, then,
as acting inspector

18:41.354 --> 18:44.421
Of station house four,
will you accept my request

18:44.491 --> 18:45.957
To return to my former position?

18:46.092 --> 18:48.392
- Sir, I was hoping
you would ask.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.060
Request granted.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.433
- Felt quite naked
without this, actually.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.969
Now, you say
there's been trouble here?

18:59.772 --> 19:00.838
- And plenty of it, sir.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.373
- Well, then,
let's get to it, george.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.375
- Right.
(susannah crying)

19:04.377 --> 19:07.578
- And you are a very brave
little girl

19:07.713 --> 19:09.513
And I love you.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.582
- Yes, you are.
(susannah crying)

19:16.455 --> 19:17.921
- He was hanged.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.790
Bruises around
his wrists and mouth

19:19.859 --> 19:22.059
Suggest he was also
bound and gagged.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.128
- And the second victim?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.264
- Oh, it was quite nasty,
detective.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.332
He was killed
with a sandblaster.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.669
- So, no trace evidence
to be found?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.171
- Nothing usable.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.341
- And the first victim?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.543
- I preserved what I could,

19:38.678 --> 19:40.177
But as you can see
from my report,

19:40.312 --> 19:42.479
The cause of death seems clear.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.183
- Hm. Indeed.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.018
- Hm.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.687
- Did you retain
in your possession

19:49.756 --> 19:50.788
The victim's clothing?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.357
- From this victim, yes.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.491
From the first victim,

19:54.527 --> 19:57.161
Some blankets,
and from the second...

19:57.163 --> 19:59.129
Just the tarp
he was covered with.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.565
- Could you retrieve them
for me, please?

20:01.568 --> 20:02.499
- Of course.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.036
- I don't know, inspector.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.504
There are very few businesses

20:06.639 --> 20:08.639
That fit the description
of candlestick maker.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.708
- It has to be
a metaphor of some sort.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.309
- Mm.
- Where...

20:13.446 --> 20:14.445
Where's higgins?

20:15.514 --> 20:16.781
- I haven't seen him.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.315
- I haven't seen him
since I sent him

20:18.384 --> 20:20.050
To the butcher's.
Will you check on him?

20:20.086 --> 20:21.185
- Of course.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.258
- I was in fear every day.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.794
If anything had happened...

20:29.796 --> 20:31.462
- Thank god it didn't.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.799
You all right?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.000
(sighs)

20:36.970 --> 20:38.269
- We broke the law.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.671
William and I.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.075
And it didn't matter.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.544
We would have done anything
to keep her from harm.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.147
- Is that why you brought
that woman back with you?

20:51.551 --> 20:53.217
- Her name is hilda fanshaw.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.887
(scoffs)
we got her out of jail

20:57.023 --> 20:58.289
And set up another woman

20:58.424 --> 21:01.892
For a murder that I am sure
she committed.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.527
- What happened to that woman?

21:04.731 --> 21:07.364
- I think mrs. Fanshaw
had her killed.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.901
And, effie...

21:10.903 --> 21:12.937
I wrote a false confession.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.872
- You had to protect your child.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.409
- Yes. I had to save my child.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.179
- Why did you bring
mrs. Fanshaw back with you?

21:23.249 --> 21:25.249
- We're charging her
with kidnapping us.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.583
And susannah.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.053
We're going to make sure
she never sees the light of day.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.188
- Well, I do have
some friends

21:31.257 --> 21:32.723
At the crown attorney's office.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.592
- Thank you, effie.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.661
I have another favour to ask.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.463
- Of course. Anything.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.600
- Would you take susannah
just for a little while longer?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.870
I hate the thought
of letting her out of my sight

21:46.005 --> 21:49.540
But there are some loose ends
that I need to tie up.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.609
- Of course.
We'll go to the park.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.012
Before we go,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.547
I have a bit of news.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.549
It's more like gossip.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.951
- Oh?
(chuckles)

22:01.020 --> 22:02.687
- Miss hart is broke.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.621
- What?
- Arthur carmichael's family

22:04.623 --> 22:06.023
Sued for his fortune
and the judge

22:06.092 --> 22:07.358
Ruled in their favour.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.260
She's lucky she didn't
get jail time.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.295
(scoffs)

22:11.964 --> 22:13.497
Are y-you pleased?

22:13.499 --> 22:14.531
- No.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.635
It just seems that
miss hart and I

22:17.637 --> 22:19.035
Are peas in a pod.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.537
(chuckling)

22:24.043 --> 22:25.643
- Ah, the ammonia please.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.712
- Would you care to let me in
on what it is you're doing?

22:28.781 --> 22:29.780
- According to george,

22:29.849 --> 22:32.516
The victims were all
owners of factories

22:32.585 --> 22:36.120
That suffered a number
of industrial accidents.

22:36.255 --> 22:39.923
Now, if the killer visited
these factories

22:39.959 --> 22:41.658
Or worked in one of them,

22:41.728 --> 22:43.794
It's possible that
he transferred trace amounts

22:43.929 --> 22:47.131
Of chemicals to the victims
when he confronted them.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.198
- Mm.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.871
- Mm-hmm.
The second tray, please.

23:00.380 --> 23:03.414
Mm-hmm. And the third victim.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.524
Hm. There you have it.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.229
There are traces of arsenic
with all three of the victims.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.362
- Meaning?

23:19.399 --> 23:20.764
- It makes possible

23:20.800 --> 23:23.700
That their assailant also
had a large amount of arsenic

23:23.770 --> 23:25.101
On his clothing.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.771
- Where would that
have come from?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.907
- Arsenic in large amounts
is used in metal refining.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.642
- The candlestick maker?

23:31.644 --> 23:32.843
- Possibly.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.911
- Detective.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.012
It's good to have you back.

23:36.048 --> 23:40.717
- Oh. Strange as it may seem,
I am glad to be back.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.653
- Sir.
- What have you?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.254
- The woman you brought
into the cells

23:44.290 --> 23:46.122
Is in a highly agitated state.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.992
She demands to see you.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.059
- Does she now?

23:49.128 --> 23:50.795
- She's causing quite
the commotion.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.000
(suspenseful music)

24:04.911 --> 24:06.610
- What do you want?

24:06.745 --> 24:09.279
- Out, obviously.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.415
You let me go,
and you'll never see me again.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.752
- That will be happening,
regardless.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.820
You'll be tried

24:16.823 --> 24:18.989
And jailed for the rest
of your life.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.694
- How much will it take for you
to open that door and walk away?

24:24.897 --> 24:26.363
- There isn't enough.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.632
You are a murderess.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.102
- $5,000?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.571
How many years would it take
for you to earn that?

24:36.843 --> 24:39.576
- I've never been motivated
by money.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.911
You should know that.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.547
- I can double it.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.050
- Seeing you back here
behind bars

24:47.086 --> 24:49.186
Is all the compensation I need.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.390
- Detective...

24:53.392 --> 24:54.925
- Yes?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.594
- You are making
a terrible mistake.

24:58.798 --> 24:59.930
- Hm.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.879
- Higgins?

25:15.882 --> 25:16.780
Henry!

25:17.350 --> 25:18.415
(groaning)

25:18.451 --> 25:20.017
Help me get these
two out of here.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.824
- How're you feeling?
- Mm.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.425
My head aches

25:28.494 --> 25:30.761
And I just want to sleep.

25:30.830 --> 25:31.962
- You can't.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.297
- Mm.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.500
Did you find out anything about
the person who did this to me?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.768
- No.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.969
(penny): It was that woman,
wasn't it?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.471
- I don't think so.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.706
- Inspector?

25:42.742 --> 25:43.774
- What is it?

25:43.776 --> 25:45.576
- One of the lifeboats
has gone missing.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.646
- Keep an eye on her
and let's get everyone on deck.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.846
- Mm-hmm.
- Show me.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.718
- You'll be all right,
mrs. Brackenreid.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.255
But take this as a lesson:

25:58.390 --> 26:01.525
Many people prefer that their
affairs remain private.

26:02.495 --> 26:03.594
- Mm.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.865
(ominous music)

26:14.206 --> 26:15.606
- And you didn't see anything?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.141
- Just noticed
it had gone missing

26:17.276 --> 26:19.076
After I'd done my rounds.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.677
- What about
the young lad, trevor?

26:20.713 --> 26:23.681
- On the lifeboat, I'd imagine.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.417
I'd say we found the killer,

26:26.552 --> 26:28.218
But we failed to capture him.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.624
- Would he have known how
to detach one of these boats?

26:34.660 --> 26:36.894
- Apparently, he did.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.629
- In broad daylight?

26:38.631 --> 26:40.296
- Well, you were in your cabin.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.098
I was on the bridge.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.767
Wouldn't have taken
more than a moment.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.369
Mrs. Griffith and the other lady

26:45.504 --> 26:47.170
Were taking the sun
on the back deck.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.641
- Notify the authorities
on shore.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.142
- Will do. And?

26:52.277 --> 26:54.311
- Let's get back to toronto.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.646
- Right away.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.285
(ship horn blowing)

27:13.799 --> 27:15.599
(indistinct chatter)

27:21.540 --> 27:22.706
- Can I help you?
- No.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.341
- Well, you can't be here.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.275
This area's closed
to the public.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.677
- Thought you were the police.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.345
- Yeah?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.080
- So, that means
you work for us.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.817
- Why don't you get out
or I'll lock you up.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.020
- Keep your pants on. I'm going.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.256
(watts): Inspector crabtree?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.493
- Henry! Are you all right?

27:42.495 --> 27:43.694
- Oh, yes. Never better.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.162
- Someone tried
to kill the butcher.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.763
- Uh, me, as well.

27:47.766 --> 27:48.765
Sir, you're alive!

27:48.834 --> 27:50.300
- Yes, it seems we both are.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.702
- Yes, barely.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.170
- Gentlemen, I-I may
have something.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.839
- Sir, we can use
the inspector's office.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.374
Or my office.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.376
(suspenseful music)

28:01.280 --> 28:02.780
- Uh, george?

28:04.316 --> 28:06.050
- Yes, sir, I know.
I've been busy.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.518
- Carbtree?

28:10.189 --> 28:11.921
Williams electroplating.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.792
They deal largely
in residential products.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.993
- Uh, electroplating?

28:16.128 --> 28:18.528
- It's a process of covering
an object in metal.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.731
- Right. Like silverware.
- Like a candlestick.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.133
- The candlestick maker.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.001
- And likely our target.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.404
- I checked
the hospital records.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.005
There wasn't any mention...

28:29.041 --> 28:32.209
- Yes. Because victims
of arsenic poisoning

28:32.211 --> 28:34.277
Go largely undetected.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.612
They are assessed
at the hospital

28:35.614 --> 28:36.813
And then released.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.215
But I checked
the mortality rolls,

28:39.251 --> 28:40.250
And look at this.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.520
- Two men in the last 18 months.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.422
- Both worked
for the williams company.

28:45.491 --> 28:46.890
So we put them
on our watch list.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.092
- More than that.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.227
Watts, could you
post yourself there?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.295
- Of course.
- Anything else, sir?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.131
- Yes. The two men that died

28:54.200 --> 28:56.233
Whilst in the employ
of mr. Williams

28:56.235 --> 28:58.502
Died of arsenic exposure

28:58.504 --> 29:00.104
During the process
of electroplating,

29:00.239 --> 29:02.038
And they were related.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.642
But a third man,
a blake redmond,

29:05.644 --> 29:07.978
Complained of similar symptoms.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.580
And he was let go

29:10.616 --> 29:14.050
From williams' company
three months ago.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.987
- It says here his chances
for survival are unlikely.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.390
- Hm. He is the son

29:20.459 --> 29:22.592
Of one of these two dead men.
- Uh-huh.

29:22.628 --> 29:23.994
- Well, that's worth
a conversation.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.597
- Indeed. Watts, anything
untoward happens

29:26.732 --> 29:29.066
At that electroplating facility,
I'd like to know.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.100
- Mm.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.743
- Ah, so you're here to do
what your husband won't?

29:39.812 --> 29:41.678
(chuckles)
- and what is that?

29:41.747 --> 29:43.313
- Let me out of here.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.817
- How could you do
what you did?

29:46.819 --> 29:48.518
Threaten a child.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.487
- I wanted my freedom.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.156
- You don't deserve freedom.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.792
- Well, that's not how I see it.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.494
Some of us are above the law:

29:57.563 --> 29:59.830
Kings, queens, nobility,

29:59.832 --> 30:01.632
Captains of industry.

30:01.767 --> 30:04.301
We have made the world.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.169
Laws are for lesser people.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.638
- No one is above the law.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.073
- Don't be naive.
It doesn't suit you.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.645
My husband was a horrid man.

30:14.780 --> 30:18.315
He deserved punishment
and I administered it.

30:19.451 --> 30:22.052
- You're going to die in jail.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.188
And that you deserve.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.724
(tense music)

30:27.760 --> 30:30.126
(door creaks, slams)

30:31.129 --> 30:32.863
(sighing)

30:32.932 --> 30:35.599
- How are you faring?
- Oh, much better, thank you.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.000
- Do be sure to visit
your physician.

30:37.135 --> 30:38.401
Make sure you're not concussed.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.603
- All right. I will.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.804
(caroline): You must pay us
a visit sometime.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.874
- Oh, please. We would love
to have you and thomas.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.943
- Oh! Of course.
I'd love to. It would be--

30:46.979 --> 30:48.812
(indistinct chatter)

30:48.814 --> 30:50.614
(scoffs)
if you'll excuse me?

30:50.683 --> 30:52.349
- Of course.
- Thank you. Thomas!

30:52.418 --> 30:54.083
- He wants two dollars
to take us home!

30:54.119 --> 30:55.485
- Thomas, look!

30:55.487 --> 30:57.020
That... Woman

30:57.089 --> 30:58.822
Has an extra piece of luggage.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.825
- How can you tell?
- I saw her board.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.627
She had two pieces
of fine luggage.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.829
Not that ratty old thing.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.031
- Are you certain?
- Oh, I'm positive.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.234
- You were in your cabin.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.569
I was on the bridge.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.237
Wouldn't have taken more
than a moment.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.505
Mrs. Griffith and
the other lady

31:15.641 --> 31:17.641
Were taking the sun
on the back deck.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.443
- He knew.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.777
- He knew what?

31:20.846 --> 31:23.579
- He knew that charles griffith
and fiona were married.

31:23.616 --> 31:26.516
- Married? The way
those two were carrying on?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.652
- Forget about that, margaret.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.920
Are you interested
in another mission?

31:30.956 --> 31:32.522
- You know I am.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.757
(knocking)
- driver, follow that cab.

31:34.793 --> 31:35.859
Come on!

31:43.736 --> 31:45.535
(engine revving)

31:45.671 --> 31:48.305
(suspenseful music)

32:13.499 --> 32:15.632
- Operator, station house four.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.302
(indistinct chatter)

32:19.838 --> 32:20.971
- Hello.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.038
Excuse me.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.407
(sighs)

32:26.845 --> 32:30.781
Ah! What a coincidence
finding you two here.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.382
- It is indeed.

32:32.418 --> 32:35.118
- Huh. It's nice to be
off that boat.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.954
- Oh, yes, indeed.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.990
You two seem to be bearing up
well after your loss.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.192
- Well, I do hope
that your husband

32:42.327 --> 32:44.660
Will be able to find
the man who killed charles.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.062
- Oh, as do I.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.432
- Captain roberts. Fiona.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.033
- Sir.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.002
- Please allow me
to buy you lunch.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.536
- Uh, that's not necessary.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.204
- Oh, I don't mind.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.341
I've recently come into
a considerable amount of cash.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.876
- That is charles' money.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.478
- Found in your possession.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.147
So, I'm assuming that trevor
had nothing to do with it.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.883
What did you do to him?
Kill him?

33:07.686 --> 33:09.152
- No.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.422
He needed off the boat,
I let him go.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.691
- And turned him into a suspect
for something that you did.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.027
- His choice.
- Is that so?

33:17.096 --> 33:18.327
I tell you what:

33:18.364 --> 33:20.764
Why don't we continue this
back at the station house?

33:20.766 --> 33:22.232
I suggest we skip lunch

33:22.301 --> 33:24.567
And proceed straight
to the cells, shall we?

33:24.636 --> 33:25.935
(chair thudding)

33:27.673 --> 33:29.306
- We'll do no such thing.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.774
- Oh, yes we will, sunshine.

33:31.576 --> 33:32.776
- Oh!

33:32.778 --> 33:34.778
(groaning, coughing)

33:35.647 --> 33:37.114
- What was that for?

33:37.116 --> 33:38.381
- Hitting my wife.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.051
- I didn't do that. She did!

33:41.186 --> 33:42.886
(margaret gasps)
- really?

33:43.489 --> 33:44.454
Finally!

33:44.490 --> 33:45.655
(grunts)

33:45.657 --> 33:47.156
Ha!

33:47.192 --> 33:49.960
- Sir, call inspector dawkins
at station house two.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.528
Get him down here immediately.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.265
I'm not ruining my homecoming
with these two lowlifes.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.466
(groaning)

33:57.503 --> 33:58.535
What a woman!

33:58.670 --> 34:00.270
(margaret chuckles)

34:01.073 --> 34:02.272
(exhales deeply)

34:02.274 --> 34:04.140
(door opening)

34:10.516 --> 34:12.215
(man): It'll be over soon.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.950
- No. No!

34:16.221 --> 34:18.955
- Let me guess: Arsenic.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.423
- Who are you?

34:20.426 --> 34:22.726
- Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.761
Put the syringe down,
mr. Redmond.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.430
- No. I'm almost finished.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.567
- If you do that,
you will be facing the noose.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.937
- I'm already a dead man.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.239
- You can get help.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.774
- There's no hope for me.

34:38.811 --> 34:39.809
He killed my uncle!

34:41.447 --> 34:42.645
My father.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.314
- No! No! Let me go! Let me go!

34:45.350 --> 34:46.649
(grunting)

34:47.986 --> 34:49.385
- Sit down!

34:51.590 --> 34:53.056
You're under arrest.

34:54.459 --> 34:56.326
- He deserves it.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.261
They all deserved it.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.064
They all treated us
like we were less than people,

35:01.133 --> 35:03.066
The men and women
who filled their pockets.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.885
- What do you want?
- Where are the cells?

35:23.021 --> 35:25.088
Are you hard of hearing?
Where are the cells?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.158
I trust you are aware
of what this can do.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.694
So, answer the question.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.831
- They're back there.
- Get her.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.703
- What's going on out here?
(thuds)

35:40.739 --> 35:41.704
(body thuds)

35:41.740 --> 35:42.972
- Ah-ah. Stay where you are.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.441
(groaning)

35:47.713 --> 35:50.580
Mrs. Fanshaw. You're well?

35:50.616 --> 35:53.249
- You took your sweet time,
didn't you?

35:53.285 --> 35:54.518
Where's murdoch?

35:55.854 --> 35:57.254
- I don't know.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.989
- You. Where is he?

36:00.025 --> 36:01.525
- I don't know.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.393
- Give him a taste.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.964
- All hail the conquering hero!

36:08.967 --> 36:10.834
(device whirring)

36:10.969 --> 36:12.468
(zapping)

36:26.885 --> 36:28.818
- Sir? You're back.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.019
- And you're alive.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.221
- What's happening?

36:32.257 --> 36:33.957
- There's armed men
in the station.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.024
With some old woman.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.026
- Hilda fanshaw.
She's my prisoner.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.628
- Well, she's not
a prisoner anymore.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.632
- Take this man to station house
number three.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.500
Let them know that
I've charged him with murder.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.968
I'll be in touch shortly.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.237
- And tell them to send backup.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.471
We need more men, armed men.

36:50.809 --> 36:51.841
- Sir?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.643
- Mcnab, can't you see
that I'm busy?

36:53.679 --> 36:54.911
- It's from inside the station.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.046
- Give me that.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.983
Brackenreid.

36:59.985 --> 37:00.984
Doctor ogden?

37:01.987 --> 37:03.119
Are you all right?

37:03.121 --> 37:04.287
- Yes.

37:04.289 --> 37:05.522
<i> - What's the situation?</i>

37:05.657 --> 37:06.723
- There's at least four men,

37:06.858 --> 37:09.259
All armed with william's
weaponized capacitor.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.794
Both george and henry
are being held.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.864
And one of the men
is the man who kidnapped us,

37:14.866 --> 37:16.366
A quinton crisp.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.867
<i> (brackenreid): Stay right</i>
<i> where you are.</i>

37:17.936 --> 37:19.502
- Oh! I don't think so.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.740
- Murdoch, where are you going?
- I'm going inside.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.009
- Stay put. That's an order.

37:26.078 --> 37:27.410
- I thought you retired.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.745
- And I heard you quit.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.281
- I suppose things change.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.256
- Make sure he doesn't
go anywhere.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.359
We're going outside.
- Are you sure?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.663
- There's very little I do
that I'm not sure of.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.232
Bring him.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.770
(indistinct shouting)

37:56.441 --> 37:57.707
- This will not end well.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.909
- Let us pass.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.377
- I don't think so.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.981
- Safe passage or this man dies.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.118
You have five minutes
to clear your constables.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.392
- She's the one who's taken over
my station? Bloody hell.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.666
- More coppers out there now.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.168
- They'll back away.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.872
- Shoot the stupid one.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.673
(crisp): Which one is that?

38:30.709 --> 38:33.142
(scoffs)
- you decide.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.480
- You don't even know me.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.884
(suspenseful music)

38:41.920 --> 38:43.720
(indistinct chatter)

38:52.931 --> 38:55.165
- You have two minutes
to clear your men.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.767
- You're surrounded. Surrender.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.436
- Your choice.

39:00.472 --> 39:01.504
(zapping, groaning)

39:01.573 --> 39:02.505
- Higgins.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.975
- Next time I'll be
dialing it up to eleven,

39:06.044 --> 39:08.511
And I think you know
what happens then.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.848
- You, give me a hand
with higgins.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.317
- The name's tucker.
- I don't care what

39:14.386 --> 39:15.785
Your name is.
Just give me a hand.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.620
Mcnabb, you all get around
the back of the station.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.857
- Our automobile's out back.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.658
- Mrs. Fanshaw,
you should take it.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.260
We'll delay the police.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.529
- Your best option
would be to surrender.

39:26.664 --> 39:29.465
- And who asked
your opinion, pray?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.235
- Take me out there with you.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.104
I'm the station house inspector.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.071
I can order those men
to back off.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.007
- Get mrs. Fanshaw
to the automobile.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.676
- I can take care of myself.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.044
Besides,

39:41.179 --> 39:43.613
Who's going to bother
with an innocent old woman

39:43.682 --> 39:46.883
Out for a pleasant drive
in her automobile?

39:46.885 --> 39:49.485
- I'll meet you three
back at the safe house.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.453
Grab him.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.389
Here's your chance.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.291
Get your men to back off.

39:55.427 --> 39:56.559
- And quinton?

39:57.529 --> 39:59.762
No need to be gentle
with this one.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.097
(crisp): My thoughts exactly.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.133
(whirring)

40:11.309 --> 40:14.110
(suspenseful music)

40:20.318 --> 40:22.852
(indistinct shouting)

40:22.987 --> 40:24.053
(brackenreid):
How're you doing, higgins?

40:24.122 --> 40:25.822
- I feel all tingly.

40:26.992 --> 40:27.924
- Stay there.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.226
Crabtree?

40:30.361 --> 40:32.094
- Sir! There's a prisoner
escaping out the back.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.197
(thuds, grunts)

40:35.667 --> 40:36.900
- Just remember:

40:37.035 --> 40:39.202
It didn't need to end this way.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.840
(thudding, zapping)

40:48.213 --> 40:50.746
- Truer words were never spoken.

40:50.748 --> 40:51.981
- The old lady
went out the back.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.749
- Yes. Have you seen julia?

40:53.785 --> 40:54.784
(brackenreid): No.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.086
(zapping)

40:57.155 --> 40:58.321
(body thuds)

41:08.467 --> 41:11.234
(engine sputtering)

41:11.236 --> 41:12.701
- Start, damn it.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.169
(engine sputtering)

41:14.206 --> 41:16.372
Start, why can't you?

41:16.408 --> 41:18.407
(julia): I think
you'll be needing this.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.047
- Oh. I see.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.916
- Get out of the car,
or I will drag you out!

41:31.356 --> 41:33.389
- It's over, mrs. Fanshaw.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.670
- You see the fireplace?

41:49.007 --> 41:52.208
We missed you around here
when you were a little bit sick.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.676
Can we put this on your toe?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.645
No? You don't want it
on your toe?

41:56.814 --> 41:59.081
(indistinct chatter)

41:59.117 --> 42:00.483
- I can honestly say, sir,

42:00.618 --> 42:03.086
I've never been so happy
to lose a job.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.421
- Ah, you would have grown
into it, crabtree.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.890
Although, you were left with
pretty big shoes to fill.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.359
(chuckling)

42:09.494 --> 42:10.827
- How's the missus
and the little one faring,

42:10.962 --> 42:11.828
Murdoch?

42:11.963 --> 42:13.229
I suspect it will be difficult

42:13.298 --> 42:15.898
To pry the two of them apart
for the foreseeable future.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.568
- I can see why.
Susannah's a lovely child.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.102
If she ever needs minding...
- Oh.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.305
(chuckles)
- what do you say, bugalugs?

42:22.440 --> 42:23.706
Seems like someone's
got the itch

42:23.841 --> 42:25.775
And you're not
getting any younger.

42:25.777 --> 42:29.245
- Well, sir, we have talked
about starting a family.

42:30.515 --> 42:31.914
- Talking's not the action
that's required, is it?

42:31.983 --> 42:34.317
(laughing)
- thomas! Apologies.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.785
(higgins): Hello, everyone.
Uh, george?

42:36.821 --> 42:37.853
- Higgins.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.122
- You need to see this.

42:43.728 --> 42:44.994
(murdoch): What is it, george?

42:45.129 --> 42:46.996
- My father. Uh, sirs...

42:47.865 --> 42:49.666
A-a moment, if you don't mind.

42:49.668 --> 42:51.134
Yourself as well, effie.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.402
- Excuse us.
- Of course.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.006
- George,

42:57.042 --> 42:58.474
When was your father last seen?

42:58.510 --> 42:59.542
- Uh...

43:00.979 --> 43:02.144
Sir, the last I--

43:03.315 --> 43:06.883
The last I heard from him,
he was in winnipeg.

43:06.885 --> 43:09.385
- Do you think him
capable of murder?

43:09.387 --> 43:11.954
- Sir, I shouldn't think so,
but I don't know.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.723
- I know some men
at the winnipeg constabulary.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.757
I'll see what I can do.

43:14.892 --> 43:16.893
- Sir, give me
a leave of absence.

43:17.028 --> 43:19.028
- George?
- Effie, you saw the poster.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.496
Dead or alive?

43:20.565 --> 43:22.698
I have to find him
before somebody else does.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.000
- Murdoch?

43:25.437 --> 43:26.636
- Go. Find him.

43:26.638 --> 43:28.404
(brackenreid): Take all
the time you need.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.471
- Thank you, sirs.

43:29.507 --> 43:32.075
I-I'll be back,
regardless of the outcome.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.043
Those shoes might need
filling someday.

43:34.045 --> 43:36.946
(suspenseful music)

43:42.053 --> 43:44.654
(mysterious music)

43:44.789 --> 43:47.123
Subtitling: Difuze
