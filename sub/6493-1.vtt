00:51.217 --> 00:52.980
Engine two looks fine. How's number one?

00:53.086 --> 00:55.748
Did a compression
check. Engine one looks fine.

00:56.589 --> 00:57.613
We love you, Amelia!

00:57.724 --> 00:58.725
Good luck, Amelia!

00:58.825 --> 01:01.521
Miss Earhart, do you really
think you'll break the record this time?

01:01.628 --> 01:03.789
She will fly the world's full circumference,

01:03.897 --> 01:08.596
24,902 miles,
to travel across the South Atlantic,

01:08.701 --> 01:10.862
crossing Africa, over India...

01:10.970 --> 01:12.995
After this 'round-the-world flight,
Miss Earhart,

01:13.106 --> 01:15.131
are you gonna give up long-distance flying?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.266
Not while there's still life left in me.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.208
I fly for the fun of it.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.339
Good luck!

01:24.451 --> 01:25.816
All right, give us a big smile!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.409
We love you, Amelia!

01:27.520 --> 01:29.044
Thank you. That's enough.

02:54.974 --> 02:57.272
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.109
Mr. Putnam.

02:59.212 --> 03:02.204
The headwinds were stronger
than they knew when they took off.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.217
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.155
Nine percent.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.932
When I saw that little plane,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.600
it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.813
I had to fly.

04:19.091 --> 04:23.153
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.132
Flying lets me move in three dimensions.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.253
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?

04:54.460 --> 04:57.793
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.537
Send the papers
over this afternoon. Thank you, bye.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.476
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr. Putnam?

05:11.577 --> 05:12.601
Please, sit.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.849
I'm told you want to fly
across the Atlantic Ocean.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.182
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?

05:22.622 --> 05:25.250
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.818
Why does a man ride a horse?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.861
Because he wants to, I guess.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.905
Three women have died trying.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.837
Two others have escaped with their lives.

05:41.941 --> 05:45.104
If you do make it, you will be the first,

05:45.211 --> 05:48.612
which is the real attraction
for both of us, I expect.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.175
Always nice to know
what the real attraction is.

05:53.152 --> 05:57.418
The plane was bought from
Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite,

05:57.924 --> 06:00.256
who's asked to find an American.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.523
Educated, well-spoken, a flier

06:04.864 --> 06:07.424
and preferably physically attractive.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.659
Why would that matter?

06:08.768 --> 06:11.669
Because she wants
the world to pay attention.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.165
And pretty girls command more attention.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.036
Was that your advice?

06:16.576 --> 06:20.706
There'll be a contract for the girl's
story with The New York Times.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.377
Also a book
to be published under her name.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.679
But all the money
from this will go to Mrs. Guest.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.449
Except for the part that goes to you.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.545
Well, this is America,

06:31.657 --> 06:35.320
and therefore I am obligated to
make as much money as I can.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.665
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.997
You said she wants a flier.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.509
Don't get your hopes up.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.906
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.949
There will be a male co-pilot
who will also serve as navigator.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.319
The woman will be purely a passenger.

07:08.761 --> 07:13.425
Take Lindbergh. I published his book
three months after his historic flight.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.333
Must be wonderful to actually know him,
to be a friend of his.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.302
Friend? Good God, no.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.396
Can't stand the man.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.966
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious,
boring prude.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.878
Was a bestseller though.

07:27.647 --> 07:31.413
Why would anyone want to read
a book written by a passenger?

07:31.517 --> 07:35.817
Because the hook is that they're gonna
make the woman commander.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.183
The pilot will sign a contract

07:38.291 --> 07:40.282
saying he's under
your direction and control.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.621
It would be your flight.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.627
My fraud, you mean.

07:45.665 --> 07:49.066
A very distasteful word
in book publishing, Miss Earhart.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.465
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.266
My dream has always been
to fly across the Atlantic,

07:53.372 --> 07:56.933
but the way you want me to do it is far
from the way I've envisioned it.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.601
Let me be frank.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.571
With your level of flight experience,
I wouldn't place you

08:01.681 --> 08:04.673
anywhere near the group
that would normally be considered for this,

08:04.784 --> 08:07.480
if a woman were to do any flying at all.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.787
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,

08:11.557 --> 08:13.855
I give the orders and you take them.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.019
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.825
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust

08:19.932 --> 08:21.524
in your constellation.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.625
Spoken like a gentleman.

08:23.736 --> 08:24.760
Miss Earhart.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.202
Mr. Putnam.

08:27.874 --> 08:31.139
Of course,
a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.432
What the hell are they?

09:04.544 --> 09:05.636
Oryx!

09:08.948 --> 09:10.882
Look how free they are!

09:12.385 --> 09:15.513
No constraints, no schedules to keep.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.680
For a gal who don't like schedules,

09:18.791 --> 09:22.887
you sure got yourself hooked up
with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.598
Boys, I'd like to introduce
your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.272
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.

09:38.377 --> 09:39.776
How do you do?

09:39.879 --> 09:41.608
And Bill Stultz,

09:41.714 --> 09:43.773
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.215
How much fuel do you lose
because of these?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.082
Costs us at least 400 gallons.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.582
Well, then why have them?

09:51.090 --> 09:54.856
The owner wants to protect her
plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.

09:54.961 --> 09:58.897
But those are decisions I have to make,
not somebody else.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.625
They're not making this trip, we are.

10:00.733 --> 10:04.760
But she owns the plane,
and this is still America, Miss Earhart.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.997
Ownership is the trump card.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.539
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.

10:10.643 --> 10:15.012
I wonder if it can keep us up there,
not that I've ever had enough to try.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.845
Our job is to figure out
how to fly this beauty without gasoline.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.646
Include the whole engine up here.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.812
The name is Amelia Earhart.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.396
Careful up there, Slim.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.273
They're leaving for Newfoundland.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.537
Yes, they'll be taking off
for there tomorrow, weather permitting.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.442
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.444
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.687
You know, in case.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.494
I'm honored that you would
leave these with me.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.590
Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.760
Pray I make it.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.971
Not much of a prayer man.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.236
Then at least tip your hat
and cross your fingers.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.946
Well,

11:28.320 --> 11:29.878
-see you.
-See you.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.438
It's a short hop
from Boston to Newfoundland

11:47.540 --> 11:49.405
for Amelia Earhart and crew.

11:49.508 --> 11:53.069
Then on to Ireland,
and possibly the record books.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.706
Earhart and top-notch ace
Bill Stultz have to get airborne,

11:56.816 --> 12:00.718
quite a feat once their plane is fully
loaded for the Atlantic crossing.

12:32.952 --> 12:36.444
Seems like we got a situation here,
a real problem.

12:36.889 --> 12:39.915
When you figure it out,
Commander, let us know.

13:01.013 --> 13:04.210
BILL: I don't even know
what the hell I'm saying anymore.

13:04.316 --> 13:08.343
Here's to Little Miss Earhart,
who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!

13:45.891 --> 13:47.051
What time is it?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.387
It's time to fly.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.195
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.390
Where's the weather report?

13:56.101 --> 13:57.090
It's not good enough.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.192
Great.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.501
Either we fly to Ireland
or you're going home today.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.869
Well, it's not good enough.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.375
It's fine. There's a tailwind all the way.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.877
We'll off-load to 700 gallons,
which gets us off the water

14:07.980 --> 14:09.038
and the wind will get us to Ireland.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.309
You're dumping fuel? You're serious?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.351
Just as serious as you're hung-over.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.822
Slim, you go now. Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.018
Slim, go. I've got this.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.681
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.011
He's the most caring and generous

14:48.120 --> 14:51.351
and charming
and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.381
He's my father.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.185
He's a drunk,
and he's let me down all my life.

15:00.099 --> 15:04.763
Now you get out of that goddamn bed,
and you fly that plane to Ireland,

15:04.870 --> 15:07.134
or I swear to you, I will.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.438
Good. Slim, start the engines.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.977
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.920
Have a nice flight.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.695
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.

15:50.516 --> 15:54.145
So, to take off,
you pull back on the thing, right?

15:56.221 --> 15:57.950
Go get 'em, Amelia!

16:26.251 --> 16:27.809
Start the clock!

16:56.115 --> 16:57.946
Let's hope this works!

17:12.897 --> 17:13.922
We're up.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.064
We're up. We're up!

17:19.405 --> 17:21.669
-Good work!
-Well done, Commander!

17:34.620 --> 17:37.054
The fog comes on little cat feet.

17:39.191 --> 17:43.651
It sits, looking over harbor and city,
on silent haunches

17:44.930 --> 17:46.591
and then moves on.

17:47.833 --> 17:48.993
Listen.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.534
The motors are humming sweetly.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.696
And I feel at home.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.008
You okay?

18:03.549 --> 18:06.109
Be better off if the damn radio would
join the party!

18:11.824 --> 18:12.984
Mr. Putnam! There's a call coming in.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.393
Putnam.

18:15.494 --> 18:19.260
I'm afraid we've lost contact
with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.399
Keep me informed. Thank you.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.671
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.407
How far to land?

18:37.249 --> 18:38.238
Radio is still out.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.114
There's no way to compute wind speed
and drift in the clouds,

18:41.220 --> 18:43.211
so God only knows where Ireland is.

18:43.322 --> 18:46.689
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.

18:47.192 --> 18:50.491
If we land on the water now,
we might have a rescue.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.853
And a failure!

18:55.934 --> 18:57.367
That's out.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.608
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!

19:12.684 --> 19:13.912
Slim, go help her.

19:16.788 --> 19:20.417
Hang on! Okay, I'm coming. Hold on.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.896
Got it. Take my hand.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.796
-Hang on, Slim!
-Help!

19:32.604 --> 19:34.367
You boys all right?

19:44.449 --> 19:45.609
Oh, God!

20:15.581 --> 20:16.707
Land.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.242
Land. Look.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.112
We got land!

20:29.995 --> 20:31.326
We did it!

20:32.731 --> 20:34.130
We're alive!

20:34.600 --> 20:35.897
Nice work!

20:54.119 --> 20:55.381
Amazing!

20:57.422 --> 20:59.322
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!

21:10.502 --> 21:12.436
Hello!

21:13.105 --> 21:14.936
-Hello there!
-Hello, young lady!

21:15.040 --> 21:17.065
-Fine young fella.
-Hello!

21:17.876 --> 21:20.504
Hello there, gentlemen. Hello!

21:20.612 --> 21:21.636
What do you make of that?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.612
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.713
Hurry up, man!

21:35.427 --> 21:37.554
Welcome, Miss Earhart!

21:46.505 --> 21:47.494
Miss Earhart!

21:47.606 --> 21:50.234
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!

22:02.321 --> 22:05.119
There you go,
lovely lady. Watch your step.

22:31.717 --> 22:32.706
Welcome.

22:32.818 --> 22:33.807
Thank you.

22:34.252 --> 22:37.779
Is it Irish tradition
to greet newcomers with song?

22:37.889 --> 22:40.119
I couldn't say. This is Wales!

22:47.065 --> 22:48.430
Bill, look!

23:07.552 --> 23:09.076
Hello, Dorothy.

23:11.323 --> 23:14.656
Are you going to be
the next girls to become pilots?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.155
What?

23:20.532 --> 23:21.863
It feels strange.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.902
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the two of us.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.062
Miss Earhart,
do you have a statement for the Times?

23:27.172 --> 23:28.537
We're so proud of you!

23:28.640 --> 23:30.107
We love you, Amelia!

23:32.778 --> 23:35.838
Amelia! Not in the rain!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.409
I flew across the Atlantic!

23:43.221 --> 23:44.210
Hold it right there.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.347
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.891
Do you have dirt on your face?

23:47.993 --> 23:49.858
I believe you are referring to my freckles.

23:49.961 --> 23:52.896
-They come with the skin.
-I don't like them.

23:59.237 --> 24:03.674
Very heroic. Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy. That's what they'll call you.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.078
As I look back on the flight,

24:08.180 --> 24:12.116
I think of two questions
that have been asked me most frequently:

24:12.617 --> 24:14.608
"Where are you going next?"

24:15.887 --> 24:17.980
and "What did you wear?"

24:24.129 --> 24:26.097
Lucky Strike endorsement.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.462
I wrote the copy myself.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.730
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?

24:32.137 --> 24:35.868
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were
the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.874
Which is true. I hid them under the seat.

24:37.976 --> 24:41.776
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?

24:42.547 --> 24:44.811
So that Bill and Slim get paid.

24:58.096 --> 25:03.227
Amelia Earhart,
the only woman to fly across the Atlantic,

25:03.335 --> 25:06.361
just can't keep her feet on the ground.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.406
The publisher George Putnam
has commissioned her

25:09.508 --> 25:12.534
to write a book on her flying adventures.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.347
-Thanks, fellas!
-You're welcome, Miss Earhart.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.161
You didn't have to come get me.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.758
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.098
-Well, it's just a college class, George.
-No, no, no.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.071
No. You have to take
every appearance seriously.

25:42.173 --> 25:44.368
You never know what it might lead to.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.808
Spoken by a man who should know.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.716
What was that for?

25:52.817 --> 25:54.011
Good luck?

25:54.119 --> 25:57.054
What happened to tipping your hat
and crossing your fingers?

25:57.155 --> 26:01.683
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now,
like it or not.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.355
I think I like it.

26:12.671 --> 26:15.902
What did your mother say when she knew
you flew across the Atlantic?

26:16.007 --> 26:19.841
Well, she sent a telegram
congratulating me

26:19.945 --> 26:22.140
and then she said the next time

26:22.247 --> 26:24.147
she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.418
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?

26:29.521 --> 26:31.079
Were you scared?

26:32.857 --> 26:35.690
When I looked down at the sea,

26:36.561 --> 26:39.052
it seemed much like the sky to me.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.762
As if the sky and the sea were the same.

26:42.867 --> 26:46.598
I felt much as I do
when I'm flying upward toward the sun.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.767
Transported somehow to a simple,

26:52.310 --> 26:57.805
safe, beautiful place,
where everything is comprehensible.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.619
Welcome to
the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.349
Good night, Amelia.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.788
Good night.

27:11.763 --> 27:14.493
It must have been moon glow

27:16.901 --> 27:20.337
Way up in the blue

27:22.307 --> 27:25.504
It must have been moon glow

27:27.012 --> 27:31.108
That led me straight to you

27:33.284 --> 27:34.979
I still hear you...

27:55.473 --> 27:56.838
Dance with me, George.

28:07.085 --> 28:10.486
And I keep on praying

28:12.223 --> 28:16.125
"Oh, Lord, please let this last"

28:17.262 --> 28:23.929
We seemed to float right through the air

28:28.406 --> 28:31.239
Heavenly songs

28:32.343 --> 28:37.042
Seemed to come from everywhere

28:39.818 --> 28:43.083
And now when there's moon glow

28:45.423 --> 28:49.154
Way up in the blue

28:50.829 --> 28:54.390
I'll always remember

28:55.667 --> 28:59.364
That moon glow gave me you

29:09.280 --> 29:10.508
Hello, Elinor.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.582
Mr. Putnam.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.014
Yes, please come in.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.379
Amelia.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.015
Miss Smith.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.959
I've been following your career
with a great deal of admiration.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.690
Oh, Miss Earhart,
you are such an inspiration.

29:28.032 --> 29:30.728
I never get tired
of reading about you.

29:31.236 --> 29:34.330
They're saying
you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.168
-On a good week.
-On a bad week.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.606
Depends on
whether you want the real or the sell.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.235
Oh, I don't underestimate
the value of selling.

29:41.346 --> 29:45.043
A 16-year-old girl
makes headlines illegally flying

29:45.150 --> 29:46.981
under the four bridges of the East River.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.248
You don't seem to need
much help selling yourself.

29:50.588 --> 29:52.351
Actually, Mr. Putnam,

29:53.024 --> 29:56.460
I was hoping you could do to
me what you've done to her.

29:56.995 --> 29:58.758
What's your primary ambition?

29:58.863 --> 30:01.730
To take Amelia's place as
the number one female pilot.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.659
-You want a tip?
-I do.

30:04.769 --> 30:07.260
If I listened to everyone
who said it was impossible,

30:07.372 --> 30:09.033
I'd never be flying.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.540
Don't let anyone turn you around.

30:16.247 --> 30:18.340
-You're all here.
-Thank you.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.648
So lovely to see you.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.651
-Hello.
-Good evening.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.385
Good evening, Miss Earhart.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.120
Marvelous party.

30:30.495 --> 30:34.488
Oh, Amelia. This is Gene Vidal.

30:34.599 --> 30:38.865
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.562
How do you do, Miss Earhart?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.663
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.607
I understand you're writing a book
about your transatlantic journey

30:45.710 --> 30:47.871
under the tutelage of the master.

30:47.979 --> 30:49.241
Yes.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.338
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?

30:51.449 --> 30:54.111
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.949
The distance between this world
and where I come from

30:57.055 --> 31:00.149
is as great as the distance
between the sun and the moon.

31:00.258 --> 31:03.022
And you believe the whole
"opposites attract" theory is...

31:03.127 --> 31:04.395
Pure hooey.

31:04.395 --> 31:04.486
Pure hooey.

31:05.096 --> 31:07.121
-Where are you from?
-Kansas.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.792
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?

31:09.901 --> 31:11.129
Yes, I suppose it is.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.433
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.973
It's not publicity, not promotion.

31:17.342 --> 31:20.334
Miss Earhart. May I call you Amelia?

31:21.512 --> 31:22.706
We may be from different worlds,

31:22.814 --> 31:24.714
but we have more in common
than you might imagine.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.444
-Is that so?
-Yes. I'm a teacher,

31:27.552 --> 31:30.180
at West Point, true, but still a teacher.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.812
What do you teach?

31:31.923 --> 31:33.185
Flying.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.170
Listen, Amelia...

32:01.619 --> 32:05.453
This is the first time
I've ever seen you stumped for a word.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.129
What is it?

32:15.199 --> 32:16.461
Marry me.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.929
-What?
-I want you to marry me.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.332
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.672
Don't you see
you and I embarking on a new life?

32:30.515 --> 32:31.914
Dear George.

32:32.884 --> 32:35.011
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.179
I don't believe
that one can have a fulfilled life alone.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.257
Only when it's shared.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.759
Let me share your life with you.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.391
Let me try to give you whatever you want.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.034
When I was a little girl,

33:01.145 --> 33:03.045
for my seventh birthday

33:05.149 --> 33:07.140
my father gave me a globe.

33:09.187 --> 33:12.179
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly,

33:13.224 --> 33:17.126
reading the names of all those strange,
faraway places.

33:18.463 --> 33:22.092
Morocco. Spain. Ethiopia.

33:22.433 --> 33:25.425
Dreaming that someday
I would go to those places,

33:25.536 --> 33:27.299
like a wayfarer,

33:28.840 --> 33:30.205
a traveler,

33:31.175 --> 33:32.506
a vagabond.

33:35.046 --> 33:37.105
I want to be free, George.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.008
To be a vagabond of the air.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.289
I'll help you get there.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.215
Thanks.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.587
Hello!

34:27.732 --> 34:29.996
Give me the camera.

34:51.289 --> 34:55.521
I am on my shining adventure,
flying the world.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.065
No borders, just horizons.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.328
Only freedom.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.475
Dear G.P.,

35:49.380 --> 35:52.281
You must know again
my reluctance to marry,

35:52.850 --> 35:56.308
my feeling
that I shatter thereby my life in flying,

35:56.420 --> 35:58.411
which means so much to me.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.851
In this connection,
I may have to keep some place

36:01.959 --> 36:05.122
where I can go to be myself now and then,

36:05.229 --> 36:07.663
for I cannot guarantee to endure at all

36:07.765 --> 36:11.166
the confinements of
even an attractive cage.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.524
"In our life together,

36:38.663 --> 36:42.531
"I shall not hold you
to any medieval code of faithfulness to me

36:43.201 --> 36:46.762
"nor shall I consider myself
bound to you similarly.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.901
"I must exact a cruel promise.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.941
"And that is, you will let me go in a year

36:55.046 --> 36:57.480
"if we find no happiness together."

37:01.752 --> 37:04.346
Only you, my dear Amelia,

37:04.455 --> 37:06.821
could say those brutal words to me

37:10.027 --> 37:12.825
and still have me wanting to be with you.

37:17.034 --> 37:18.262
Forever.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.140
Amelia, do you promise to love,

37:24.375 --> 37:25.933
honor and obey this man...

37:26.043 --> 37:27.237
Excuse me, sir?

37:27.678 --> 37:29.009
May we take that back a bit, please?

37:29.113 --> 37:31.104
Love, yes, if it's warranted.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.944
Honor, same thing.

37:33.050 --> 37:35.541
Obey, I can't promise that
under any circumstances,

37:35.653 --> 37:37.553
but the groom understands that.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.555
Please remove "obey" from the prayer

37:39.657 --> 37:42.785
so we can wrap this up
before the bride runs off.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.260
I now pronounce you man and wife.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.629
Announcing
the first Women's Air Derby,

38:27.738 --> 38:30.434
racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.141
Yeah, that's fine.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.302
What's this we're hearing?

38:34.412 --> 38:36.880
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby

38:36.981 --> 38:40.007
are about to announce
the race has to end west of the Rockies.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.106
-What?
-Mmm-hmm.

38:41.218 --> 38:42.845
That's absurd,
they're cutting out half the route.

38:42.953 --> 38:43.920
What are they thinking?

38:44.021 --> 38:46.182
They're thinking that it would be bad press

38:46.290 --> 38:48.520
when you girls
start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.

38:48.626 --> 38:51.618
How dare they? I'm gonna have
a word with these gentlemen.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.663
Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.356
Come here and walk with me.

38:56.967 --> 39:01.666
I think it would benefit women fliers
everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.

39:01.772 --> 39:04.036
You know, the publicity
would put the race and all of you

39:04.141 --> 39:05.233
up there with the boys.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.375
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.

39:10.481 --> 39:14.542
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't
pass the final inspection.

39:14.652 --> 39:17.052
And let me predict that it won't.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.520
-Well, that's a threat.
-No. A prediction.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.689
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't
let anybody turn me around.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.266
Yeah, she probably meant me.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.529
Well, obviously
she doesn't see me as a threat.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.661
Oh, sure, she does.

39:34.772 --> 39:36.069
She just doesn't care.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.305
Hey, Gladys!

39:38.409 --> 39:41.173
I let the boys in charge know,
in no uncertain terms,

39:41.278 --> 39:43.041
we're not changing our route!

39:43.147 --> 39:45.547
We'll sail
over those mountains like we're eagles.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.011
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.

39:49.653 --> 39:51.814
This is what my loyalty requires.

39:51.922 --> 39:56.518
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!

39:56.794 --> 39:57.920
Clear!

40:01.866 --> 40:06.997
Amelia Earhart
organizes a competition for women pilots.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.271
Nine cities in nine days.

40:10.875 --> 40:14.470
Tragedy strikes,
and there are crashes along the way.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.673
The race continues.

40:19.784 --> 40:23.652
Thousands plan to be on hand
to witness those who make it

40:23.754 --> 40:26.314
as they approach the finish line.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.356
Here they come, folks.

40:29.460 --> 40:33.954
In first place,
Louise Thaden from Bentonville, Arkansas!

40:41.105 --> 40:46.805
In second place, Gladys O'Donnell
from Long Beach, California.

40:48.479 --> 40:53.542
Third place goes
to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!

40:57.354 --> 40:59.185
How does it feel to finish third?

40:59.290 --> 41:02.453
A victory for any woman flier is
a victory for me.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.688
I'd like
to add my congratulations to Louise Thaden

41:06.797 --> 41:09.732
and announce that
we have formed an organization

41:09.834 --> 41:12.428
to promote women in aviation.

41:12.870 --> 41:17.933
Ninety-nine women pilots have applied,
so we're calling it The Ninety-Nines.

41:19.777 --> 41:22.075
And we're going to fly forever!

41:27.751 --> 41:29.082
-George?
-Mmm-hmm?

41:29.186 --> 41:31.017
-I've been thinking.
-Yes?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.218
I want to fly the Atlantic.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.518
You already have.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.355
As a passenger. It doesn't count.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.387
I want to fly it solo.

41:44.568 --> 41:47.128
It's been five years since Lindbergh.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.306
No one has made it solo.

41:52.009 --> 41:54.000
Fourteen have died trying.

41:58.282 --> 42:00.409
I'll make it. I know I will.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.183
And if you don't?

42:07.391 --> 42:09.325
I'd rather face a watery grave

42:09.426 --> 42:11.121
than go on living as a fraud.

42:11.662 --> 42:13.960
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.232
Amelia Earhart demonstrates

42:20.337 --> 42:23.932
her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.

42:24.041 --> 42:27.067
And now she is set to climb to new heights

42:27.177 --> 42:29.941
on her second attempt
to cross the Atlantic.

42:30.047 --> 42:34.950
No more a passenger,
this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.

42:50.467 --> 42:51.900
Still sleepy?

42:53.504 --> 42:55.734
Well, I'll nap on the way.

42:57.441 --> 43:00.569
Good news about flying solo,
no one making noise.

43:02.046 --> 43:03.673
Do you have money?

43:04.882 --> 43:05.906
No.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.749
A whole 20?

43:14.058 --> 43:19.086
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.

43:21.699 --> 43:23.428
It's non-refundable.

43:25.703 --> 43:27.432
Please do your part.

43:29.139 --> 43:30.333
I will.

43:38.215 --> 43:40.240
Well, see you.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.483
Please clear the runway for takeoff.

43:54.164 --> 43:55.358
See you.

43:59.970 --> 44:02.029
Presently all clear over the Atlantic,

44:02.139 --> 44:05.040
keeping an eye
on a storm system south of the route.

44:06.310 --> 44:10.679
It was a night of stars,
of tropic loveliness.

44:11.782 --> 44:15.582
Stars hung outside
my cockpit window near enough to touch.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.438
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.891
No sign of Miss Earhart yet,
Mr. Putnam, sir.

45:30.994 --> 45:34.020
If she's on course, the moon should be
with her the rest of the way.

45:34.131 --> 45:36.531
Weather updates are coming in
every quarter-hour from Kemble.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.150
Le Bourget Aéroport, France.

46:29.253 --> 46:32.051
A galaxy of press,
well-wishers and ambassadors alike

46:32.156 --> 46:35.648
has gathered here in Paris in
anticipation of the historic moment

46:35.759 --> 46:39.718
when Amelia Earhart will touch down
where Lindbergh did years ago.

46:39.863 --> 46:41.421
The world waits with bated breath

46:41.532 --> 46:44.558
as Amelia flies solo
across the Atlantic Ocean.

47:50.901 --> 47:52.994
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?

48:27.337 --> 48:29.965
Excuse me, sir. Where am I?

48:30.407 --> 48:31.499
Uh...

48:31.608 --> 48:33.439
In Gallagher's pasture.

48:34.611 --> 48:36.169
Where are you supposed to be?

48:36.880 --> 48:39.144
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.

48:39.716 --> 48:40.705
Oh.

48:41.285 --> 48:42.479
You missed, you know.

48:43.620 --> 48:45.178
It's over there.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.453
Well, hello, sheep!

48:52.696 --> 48:53.663
Yes.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.595
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.326
She's landed in Ireland.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.402
Wonderful. Wonderful news!

49:00.671 --> 49:02.036
Journey's end.

49:02.139 --> 49:05.472
Here she is,
safe and sound on a farm in Ireland

49:05.575 --> 49:09.534
having just completed the first flight
by a woman across the Atlantic.

49:09.646 --> 49:13.207
And there's the little plane
in which she's broken all records.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.550
Well done. Well done.

49:47.584 --> 49:48.744
Action!

49:50.554 --> 49:53.921
You're on vacation
with Amelia Earhart luggage.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.817
Travel the Nile, moonlight...

50:00.297 --> 50:01.389
I'm sorry, I can't say this.

50:06.937 --> 50:11.135
I try to put the freedom
that is flying into my clothes!

50:16.480 --> 50:17.970
Eastman Kodak cameras.

50:18.682 --> 50:21.651
Travel the world, save your memories.

50:30.761 --> 50:33.889
The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,

50:33.997 --> 50:36.727
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.

50:37.401 --> 50:40.427
Fourteen hours and 54 minutes.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.099
Are you staying for this?

50:42.205 --> 50:43.536
No, I can't.

50:44.274 --> 50:46.299
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post

50:46.410 --> 50:50.073
and then organize
that photo shoot for the new luggage line.

50:50.814 --> 50:51.838
What's wrong with you today?

50:51.948 --> 50:53.313
Here I am jumping through hoops

50:53.417 --> 50:54.850
like a white horse in the circus.

50:54.951 --> 50:56.680
That's what's wrong.

50:57.487 --> 51:00.320
The only way that
we can finance your flying

51:00.424 --> 51:02.119
is to make enough money
to finance your flying.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.886
...Amelia Earhart!

51:05.695 --> 51:07.253
Go on out there.

51:20.477 --> 51:21.774
Thank you!

51:24.214 --> 51:25.943
Thank you very much.

51:32.155 --> 51:35.022
Oh. Please! Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.

51:36.159 --> 51:37.319
Miss Earhart, please.

51:37.727 --> 51:39.160
Miss Earhart?

51:41.264 --> 51:43.164
-What's your name?
-Gore.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.995
That's an unusual name.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.161
I know. I don't much like it.

51:47.270 --> 51:48.828
We blame his mother.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.772
She was a Gore,
roots going back to colonial times.

51:51.875 --> 51:53.001
Hello.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.803
God, do I have to wade through that?

51:56.913 --> 51:59.347
You will have two Vidal men
to protect you. You'll be fine.

51:59.483 --> 52:01.849
You are so much prettier
than your pictures.

52:01.952 --> 52:02.976
Well, thank you, but that...

52:03.086 --> 52:05.316
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?

52:05.422 --> 52:06.514
"Well done."

52:06.623 --> 52:08.090
Are you gonna write another book?

52:08.191 --> 52:10.659
Yes, if my husband
has anything to say about it.

52:10.760 --> 52:11.727
Take my hand.

52:11.828 --> 52:15.127
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.

52:32.616 --> 52:34.413
You know, that woman was right.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.351
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.

52:37.454 --> 52:40.218
You are much prettier than your pictures.

52:44.094 --> 52:48.554
It all seems rather silly
considering what's happening out there.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.156
Those men, all those families.

52:52.335 --> 52:54.530
Why have I been given so much?

52:56.473 --> 52:59.067
You've earned the spotlight. Enjoy it.

52:59.342 --> 53:02.106
You'll be fine. Just hold on to yourself.

53:03.446 --> 53:05.471
I'm not sure who that is anymore.

53:05.582 --> 53:08.449
She's that girl
from Kansas who says "hooey."

53:41.051 --> 53:44.714
Distinguished
dignitaries from every corner of the world,

53:44.821 --> 53:48.222
please rise and welcome
Miss Amelia Earhart,

53:48.325 --> 53:52.955
honored guest of President Roosevelt
and the League of American Pilots.

53:53.196 --> 53:55.858
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot

53:55.966 --> 54:00.266
who, at age 15, became the youngest
woman in the world to fly solo.

54:00.737 --> 54:04.400
This year, she's recognized
as Woman Pilot of the Year.

54:04.975 --> 54:08.877
Here's to Elinor Smith,
an inspiration to us all.

54:11.081 --> 54:14.573
Your husband
encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.

54:14.684 --> 54:17.710
My husband wouldn't want me
to fly to N Street.

54:18.121 --> 54:20.681
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?

54:21.358 --> 54:23.292
Franklin doesn't forbid.

54:24.294 --> 54:27.889
He just feels it's a waste
of my valuable time to learn

54:27.998 --> 54:30.057
since I can't afford to buy a plane.

54:30.166 --> 54:32.327
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.

54:34.838 --> 54:40.276
I did ask about aviation,
but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.

54:40.677 --> 54:42.804
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.

54:42.912 --> 54:47.372
I think the structure may be less important
than the man chosen to run it.

54:47.917 --> 54:52.217
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?

54:52.322 --> 54:54.483
This may be one of those rare instances

54:54.591 --> 54:57.492
when the most accomplished
candidate turns out to be male.

54:57.594 --> 54:59.323
Is it a name I know?

55:00.530 --> 55:01.861
Gene Vidal.

55:02.299 --> 55:05.700
I love finding the exception
that proves the rule.

55:06.403 --> 55:08.997
How do you feel about flying at night?

55:17.280 --> 55:19.908
Whoa! There we are,
ladies and gentlemen, champagne.

55:20.016 --> 55:22.416
Champagne to toast the first lady.

55:30.427 --> 55:33.021
Put your hands on the wheel!

55:33.897 --> 55:36.593
It's dual controls. No one'll ever know.

55:39.235 --> 55:44.468
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to toast to you!

55:46.042 --> 55:48.169
Oh. Dear God!

56:00.256 --> 56:01.621
Good night.

56:09.132 --> 56:12.033
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.

56:14.170 --> 56:15.797
She seems quite taken with you.

56:15.905 --> 56:17.429
And vice-versa.

56:17.907 --> 56:21.172
Then again, lots of people
are quite taken with you.

56:22.078 --> 56:25.104
If you're referring to Gene,
as I know you are,

56:25.215 --> 56:27.115
I was able to get a word in for him,

56:27.217 --> 56:29.151
to head the Aeronautics Branch.

56:29.252 --> 56:30.514
How did it go?

56:30.620 --> 56:33.418
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.

56:33.523 --> 56:37.152
Gene is so fortunate
to have you in his corner, Amelia.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.660
He'll help me and I'm helping him.

57:02.719 --> 57:09.147
You do something to me

57:10.860 --> 57:17.766
Something that simply mystifies me

57:20.437 --> 57:26.398
Tell me
Why should it be

57:29.179 --> 57:35.846
You have the power to hypnotize me

57:36.820 --> 57:38.754
Transcontinental was too ambitious.

57:38.855 --> 57:41.187
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.

57:41.291 --> 57:44.624
But the shuttle,
Washington, New York, Boston,

57:44.727 --> 57:46.718
we think it's the future.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.098
Will you go there with us?

57:49.432 --> 57:51.662
What on earth would you need me for?

57:51.768 --> 57:54.703
You're the most
famous woman in America, that's what for.

57:56.439 --> 57:57.804
You know, I can see it now.

57:57.907 --> 57:59.738
You on the poster with Gene,

57:59.843 --> 58:01.606
a legendary athlete at West Point,

58:01.711 --> 58:03.076
two events at the Olympics,

58:03.179 --> 58:05.739
a top pilot who's gonna be running
the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.

58:05.849 --> 58:07.646
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.

58:11.421 --> 58:18.350
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...

58:36.779 --> 58:37.180
May I ask you a question?

58:37.180 --> 58:37.839
May I ask you a question?

58:37.947 --> 58:39.778
That woman over there.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.109
She's beautiful.

58:45.455 --> 58:49.414
You're the only woman I know
who points out other beautiful women.

58:50.860 --> 58:52.225
Lovely legs,

58:53.663 --> 58:54.857
unlike mine.

58:55.231 --> 58:57.222
No, I'm sure that's not true.

58:57.333 --> 58:59.528
That's why you wear trousers?

59:00.270 --> 59:01.328
No.

59:02.171 --> 59:06.198
And all this while I thought you just
wanted to be one of the boys.

59:06.843 --> 59:10.210
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.

59:29.132 --> 59:30.156
Was that Amelia Earhart?

59:30.266 --> 59:32.200
Sixth floor, please.

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.110
Gore!

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:04.625
AMELIA: I couldn't wait
for your visit this weekend.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.955
Lewis. Lewis.

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:15.362
Help! Tiger, tiger!

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.768
Ah. The wallpaper.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.371
Coming, Gore.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.080
It's okay.

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:32.277
Do you know
why I papered this room like this?

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.849
No. But I wish you hadn't.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:41.319
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:46.399
So, when I find myself worrying about it,

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:50.599
I test my courage by coming into this room

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.836
and pretending I'm in the deepest,
darkest part of Africa.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:59.808
In a jungle so thick,
I can’t even see the sky above.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.011
And I start to feel better right away

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:07.755
because I looked my fear right in the face.

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.234
Miss Earhart?

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:20.860
Yes?

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:24.170
Could you please marry my father?

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.409
Then I'll never be afraid
of anything ever again.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.499
Aw.

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.377
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.814
Why can't you be married
to Mr. Putnam and my father?

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.489
I put together one month in Europe.

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:45.357
Had to close some foreign licensing deals,
open new markets.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.428
When are you leaving?

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:49.430
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.163
I don't see how I could.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.132
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.796
They're willing to switch
some of the lecture dates, just for us.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.703
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:03.978
I've just started as Gene's consultant
at the Aeronautics Branch.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.815
Normally I'd be worried
about leaving you here alone,

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.945
but I suppose
that won't be a problem, will it?

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.183
What are you trying to say?

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:24.657
Gene, here in our house, when I am here,

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:27.099
is one thing. When I am not here,

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.033
-I can't have it.
-I understand.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.733
I can't have it.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.402
Hello?

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:46.511
I found something you'd written.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:49.609
Quite beautiful.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:56.349
"To touch your hand
and see your face today is joy.

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:02.855
"Your casual presence
in a room recalls the stars

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.759
"that watched us as we lay.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:12.438
"I mark you in the moving crowd
and see again those stars

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.872
"a warm night lent us long ago.

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:19.072
"We loved so then, we love so now."

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.851
Thank you so much for writing that.

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.948
Even though I'd never seen it.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.987
At the time, I...

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.086
George?

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.543
George.

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.462
Thank you.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.834
How are you?

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.569
I wondered if you
were avoiding me a little or...

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.473
Just very, very busy.

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.708
I'm leaving for Indiana.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:32.754
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build
a Women's Careers Department there.

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:35.187
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.259
What's special about now?

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.320
You don't read the papers?

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.861
Not unless someone makes me.

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.089
Well, someone should.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:44.632
They're all saying
you took recklessly dangerous solo flights

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:48.431
for no earthly purpose other than publicity,
meaning money.

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:52.234
They also harp on a growing list of
products you commercially endorse.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.673
How thoughtless of me
to be doing all this in a society

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:58.440
where no one else is interested in making
money, present company included.

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:02.608
People viewing you as Lady Lindy,
America's sweetheart of the skies,

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:07.314
the wife, mother, daughter
they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.548
Thanks for the tip.

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:10.852
Thanks for not being defensive.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.928
I've decided I'm resigning as your
consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:25.007
The public linking of our names does more
harm to that image of mine

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.473
than everything else put together.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:31.144
And you, of all people,
should know that whatever I do,

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.112
I do so that I can fly.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:38.642
And I want to fly
that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:43.618
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:45.319
It can't be done.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.860
Well, I'm going to try.

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.633
And I'm going home.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.033
To George.

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.037
You can't mean that.

01:08:54.596 --> 01:08:56.622
Race you to New York City.

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:07.537
Well, are you going to tell me your
surprise, or do I need to be physical?

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.941
Boy, that's exactly what I want.

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.481
Come on, G.P., tell me.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:20.211
If you're serious about this
flying-around-the-world nonsense,

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:23.051
then it might be handy
to have a plane to fly in.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.593
Except it would have to be an Electra,
and they cost...

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:29.755
$36,000, after a generous discount
from Lockheed.

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.332
It may as well be a billion.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.924
Not to mention at least another $36,000

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.935
to have it modified and ready.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.533
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:43.904
No, actually, a university.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.447
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:51.417
an Amelia Earhart Fund
for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:56.651
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:59.626
for a suitable flying laboratory.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.894
The Electra?

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.669
Your Electra, Amelia.

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.798
George!

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:20.608
Well, there is one thing. The trustees and
the donors, they have to be on board also.

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:23.184
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:27.779
No, there will be no more horses,
no more hoops, for my Amelia.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.718
Thank you, George.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.596
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies,

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:37.165
you know her death
will not be a plus for aviation women,

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.733
or your next campaign.

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.631
What if she doesn't die?

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:44.900
What if she just circumnavigates
the globe and it's a plus for everyone?

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:47.942
The closest land west of Hawaii is
beyond the range of the Electra.

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.135
She'll refuel in the air.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.906
She doesn't have the flying skills.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.378
She's taking bigger risks.

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.312
Yes. I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.145
I understand the danger, fellas.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:59.483
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:06.256
This is Howland Island.

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.557
It's halfway
between Honolulu and New Guinea.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.026
It has no elevation, no trees,

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:14.261
hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.897
It would be
almost impossible to spot from the air.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:22.569
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand
in a thousand miles of nowhere.

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:26.876
If you miss this island,
you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:30.917
But I'll have Fred Noonan,
the best celestial navigator around.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.648
In fact,
she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:36.418
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.286
Safety first, yes?

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:45.224
You've always had Amelia's
best interest at heart.

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:47.928
And for that, we're both grateful.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.262
Stay for supper?

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:55.265
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:56.969
Please tell Gore hello for me.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:03.118
Give him this. He can track the time zones.

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.685
He misses you.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.702
He doesn't understand, really.

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:46.159
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.523
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.499
Hello, Fred.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:55.570
Ma'am.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.536
-Good to see you.
-And you.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.606
Thank you.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.344
Are we sizing me up?

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:16.816
I'm told midair refueling
would be beyond my abilities.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.621
You have to put in time,
learn the technique.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:23.425
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash,

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:26.865
60%, you don't get the fuel,
so you're cooked anyway.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.374
Better odds of hitting that island?

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.267
How do you feel about 100%?

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.574
Even with cloud cover?

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.514
Pan Am told you I'm the best
celestial navigator they've ever seen.

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:43.710
They did.

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:46.913
Someone else told you
I got a drinking problem.

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:49.923
Which is a big part
of why we're here, right?

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.322
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you,

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.057
nothing's interfered
with my performance, not once.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.999
We'd be looking for
an island less than two miles long,

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.864
with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.766
That's what you'd be looking for.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:05.032
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.433
How can I lose?

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:17.909
Amelia Earhart
leaves Oakland for Honolulu,

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.320
setting out on the most
dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:25.723
to traverse the waistline of the world.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.298
How about
a smile for the people back in the States?

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.833
Miss Earhart, look this way.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.042
Take care of her, Fred.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.408
That's great. Thanks.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.949
One big one
for the camera, Miss Amelia!

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:52.851
You know, we've got so much fuel
we can't possibly get off the ground.

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:54.718
Much safer than flying.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.348
Well, we'll need enough
for a third pass at Howland

01:14:57.459 --> 01:15:00.087
after you miss it
the first couple times around.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.753
Good thinking.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.263
Thank you!

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.265
One more,
please, Miss Earhart.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.699
Right here, Amelia!

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:12.297
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:20.439
Clear!

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.013
No!

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:06.621
You all right?

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:09.486
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.417
Come on, Fred!

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:23.938
Right engine, get the right
engine! Hose on there, right underneath.

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.974
-We need tetrachloride here.
-Pyrene, pyrene.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.542
Sam,
make sure you get a picture of that.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.640
Make sure
you get a good shot of their faces!

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.853
Turn her up. Okay, go.

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:12.552
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.748
I'll make it back and more, I promise.

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.256
The book sales, the lectures,

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:20.522
this flight
will keep us going another three years.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.690
Maybe.

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.823
No, it will, I promise.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.228
Our sales, our prices are going to double.

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.270
This just showed them
how dangerous it all is.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.532
They were taking it for granted.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.766
They thought I was competent.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:34.205
Here.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:37.335
I meant, maybe...

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.572
Maybe we can just stop it.

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.309
You mean after?

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.222
Or even now.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:56.188
So my exit would be a stupid crash

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:00.359
and withdrawing from
a world-publicized attempt

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.529
to finally do something
no man had done before.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.567
It would ruin us in the bargain.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:07.801
-Mmm-hmm. Yes.
-We'd have nothing.

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.638
Mmm-hmm. It's true.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:12.671
And I'd be fine with that.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:18.048
That's because you're an idiot.

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.156
Lucky for you.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:29.987
And what if it's
not something I need to show the world?

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:34.097
What if it's something I need to show me?

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:47.075
I don't really have a choice,
I have to reverse the route.

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:50.447
I'd be facing hurricanes in the
Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.918
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.420
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.582
So, I just won't get tired.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.861
What's the timetable on the plane?

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.324
Three weeks. She'll be good as new.

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.423
We have a remarkable crew here.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.093
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.693
...buy, yeah.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.163
All the money wasted
that's never coming back.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.832
You cut the engines.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:17.935
It would've cost a bundle more
to replace a burnt-out plane.

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:21.207
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.749
I overreacted.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:26.480
The plane was too heavy, I should've used
more rudder instead of the throttle. I...

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.283
It's only money.

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:32.049
We'll figure this out. We always do.

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:54.913
Have you considered, Miss Earhart,
that your enthusiasm as a pilot

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:59.510
outweighs your ability, as demonstrated
by the disaster in Honolulu?

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.350
People are saying that you're reckless,

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:03.185
a better celebrity than pilot.

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:06.626
Enthusiastic? Yes.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.821
Reckless? Not on your life.

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.991
I'm a flier pursuing my passion
for the fun of it, that's all.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.399
Thank you. A future flier!

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.712
You can do it, Amelia!

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.375
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:30.144
We love you, Amelia!

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.828
She will fly the world's full circumference,

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:46.697
24,902 miles,
to travel across the South Atlantic,

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:50.464
crossing Africa, over India,
and across the wide Pacific...

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.472
After this 'round-the-world flight,
Miss Earhart,

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.542
are you gonna give up long-distance flying?

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.702
Not while there's still life left in me.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.676
Always ready for a new adventure.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.270
Great, great.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:01.371
Fred, you're on.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.883
Hey, Fred,
give us a big smile for the camera!

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.289
Come back to me.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.924
Always.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.616
Hurry up, come on! Hurry up!

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:39.516
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:40.747
Just one more, please!

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:43.551
Miss Earhart,
over here! Miss Earhart!

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.795
See you.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:27.000
A fairyland of
beauty lay below and about me

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:31.801
so lovely as to distract
a pilot's attention from the task at hand,

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:36.302
that of herding a heavy plane
out of that great upland saucer

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:39.209
and over the mountains that make its rim.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.254
What is this thing, huh?

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.451
Whole thing's made of mud.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.221
It's beautiful.

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:40.240
It's like working with you.

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:45.173
Come on, Amelia.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.489
Amelia Earhart has
reached Calcutta...

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.789
Dad! Dad! It's a bulletin!

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.796
...but heavy rains have
temporarily grounded her.

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:06.458
She will push on to Bangkok,
then Papua New Guinea

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:10.436
before heading east
toward her final destination, California.

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:16.601
We should go, Fred.

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.872
Oh, come on! You're not really taking off?

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.005
It's only going to get heavier.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.949
We could be stuck here for days,
even weeks.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.919
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok,
it's lighter there.

01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:30.457
To get that far in a monsoon,
you'd need divine help!

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:31.547
Chai?

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:32.648
Thank you.

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:38.025
Come on, Fred.

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:09.396
You think we should turn back, huh?

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.522
Nope. I think we shouldn't have come.

01:26:38.876 --> 01:26:40.104
Hi, Joan.

01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:41.735
Hello, Frances.

01:26:59.197 --> 01:27:01.256
You look beat, lady.

01:27:01.365 --> 01:27:03.356
That's funny, you look tip-top.

01:27:03.467 --> 01:27:05.867
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:08.165
Might as well keep you company.

01:27:08.806 --> 01:27:10.433
I've got some good flying stories.

01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:12.700
Thank you.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:13.936
Yeah.

01:27:16.514 --> 01:27:20.006
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.

01:27:23.254 --> 01:27:25.654
An honest one, if I say so myself.

01:27:29.527 --> 01:27:31.688
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.

01:27:32.663 --> 01:27:35.996
If you mean Gene,
we're not together anymore.

01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:39.202
In that way. Not for a long time.

01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:42.000
You don't think I love my husband?

01:27:42.473 --> 01:27:43.599
Actually, I do.

01:27:44.642 --> 01:27:46.234
In a certain way.

01:27:47.578 --> 01:27:49.205
But you disapprove of how I live?

01:27:49.313 --> 01:27:50.575
Hell, no.

01:27:51.115 --> 01:27:54.846
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.

01:27:54.952 --> 01:27:56.146
Meaning?

01:27:57.121 --> 01:27:59.919
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.

01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:02.618
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage

01:28:05.196 --> 01:28:06.823
of an opportunity.

01:28:13.604 --> 01:28:15.936
If you have a point, make it.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.632
I believe I have.

01:28:24.915 --> 01:28:28.476
All you need to do
is just show up tomorrow morning,

01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:30.247
show up sober,

01:28:30.354 --> 01:28:32.049
and get me to Howland Island.

01:28:53.711 --> 01:28:55.201
Ready, ma'am.

01:28:58.115 --> 01:28:59.480
Thank you.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.420
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?

01:29:12.897 --> 01:29:14.330
Oh, I don't smoke.

01:29:15.032 --> 01:29:17.262
Or something?

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.113
Earhart here.

01:29:31.816 --> 01:29:33.306
Putnam here.

01:29:37.054 --> 01:29:38.544
You should be sleeping.

01:29:40.558 --> 01:29:42.389
You should be working.

01:29:43.027 --> 01:29:44.358
I'm running a big adventure here.

01:29:44.862 --> 01:29:46.625
I'm a very important fellow.

01:29:47.231 --> 01:29:52.100
You told me I was the star
and you'd be nearby,

01:29:52.203 --> 01:29:55.570
a small particle of dust
in my constellation.

01:29:57.775 --> 01:30:01.233
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.

01:30:04.749 --> 01:30:07.582
I'll be in Honolulu on the third

01:30:07.685 --> 01:30:10.677
and with you in Oakland
on the Fourth of July, okay?

01:30:12.022 --> 01:30:13.421
Don't keep me waiting.

01:30:14.425 --> 01:30:15.722
I won't dare.

01:30:17.595 --> 01:30:19.290
How's Fred? On the wagon?

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:23.664
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.

01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:28.233
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.605
Fred is fine.

01:30:30.708 --> 01:30:33.836
He's calculating
headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.

01:30:34.612 --> 01:30:37.172
So what's that I hear in your voice?

01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:41.044
Is he drinking?

01:30:41.685 --> 01:30:42.674
I can handle it.

01:30:42.887 --> 01:30:45.720
All right, call it off. Call it off now.

01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:48.752
Right now, Amelia. I mean it. Right now.

01:30:53.164 --> 01:30:54.722
I can handle it.

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:01.061
After the Fourth, we're going home.

01:31:02.973 --> 01:31:04.270
Where is that?

01:31:05.075 --> 01:31:08.067
For me? Anywhere you are.

01:31:16.987 --> 01:31:19.046
I'm going to like it there.

01:31:23.093 --> 01:31:25.891
I'd better,
since this is going to be my last flight.

01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:30.525
If you insist.

01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:37.669
I love you.

01:31:54.325 --> 01:31:55.690
Should I let you go now?

01:31:56.093 --> 01:31:57.458
No, never.

01:32:07.238 --> 01:32:09.968
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.

01:32:11.842 --> 01:32:13.104
See you,

01:32:15.346 --> 01:32:16.779
my darling.

01:32:23.087 --> 01:32:24.850
See you, my love.

01:33:05.396 --> 01:33:07.421
It looks like she's ready to leave.

01:33:25.015 --> 01:33:27.449
Might be easier to just shoot me.

01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:29.416
Traveling light, is all.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.387
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?

01:33:36.026 --> 01:33:38.426
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

01:33:39.997 --> 01:33:42.830
It's fine. Everything is.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:53.870
-Have you filled the other side?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:17.959
Not more than a month ago,
I was on the other shore of the Pacific,

01:34:18.068 --> 01:34:19.968
looking westward.

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:23.005
This morning,
I look eastward over the Pacific.

01:34:23.107 --> 01:34:26.099
In these fast-moving days
that have intervened,

01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:29.611
the whole width of the world
has passed behind us

01:34:29.713 --> 01:34:32.238
except this broad ocean.

01:34:32.349 --> 01:34:36.547
I shall be glad when we have
the hazards of this navigation behind us.

01:34:37.087 --> 01:34:39.783
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.

01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:41.152
Mr. Putnam.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:43.920
The headwinds were stronger
than they knew when they took off.

01:34:44.495 --> 01:34:48.261
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.292
Nine percent.

01:35:01.078 --> 01:35:04.309
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?

01:35:06.984 --> 01:35:10.010
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?

01:35:15.893 --> 01:35:17.724
Mr. Putnam, I can’t reach them, sir.

01:35:18.495 --> 01:35:20.656
I tried voice and Morse Code.

01:35:20.764 --> 01:35:24.325
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.

01:35:24.435 --> 01:35:26.903
Just stay with voice. You'll get them.

01:35:50.561 --> 01:35:52.222
At ease, sailor.

01:35:56.467 --> 01:35:59.925
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?

01:36:03.941 --> 01:36:05.704
The battery's dead.

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:23.815
Itasca, this is Earhart.
We're about 200 miles out.

01:36:24.328 --> 01:36:26.193
Sky overcast. Over.

01:36:27.498 --> 01:36:29.625
That's her, on 3105.

01:36:30.234 --> 01:36:31.997
She said "cloudy and overcast."

01:36:47.017 --> 01:36:48.450
Itasca, this is Earhart.

01:36:49.186 --> 01:36:51.347
Sky overcast. Over.

01:36:52.089 --> 01:36:54.455
We are receiving your signal.
Please acknowledge ours.

01:36:54.558 --> 01:36:56.719
What is your position
and ETA Howland? Over.

01:37:07.504 --> 01:37:10.962
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Unable to hear you, over.

01:37:13.076 --> 01:37:16.204
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?

01:37:21.451 --> 01:37:24.784
King How Able Queen Queen.
Please acknowledge our signals on key.

01:37:24.888 --> 01:37:26.219
Please acknowledge. Over.

01:37:31.028 --> 01:37:34.361
She's having trouble
with voice transmission. Stay with Morse.

01:37:45.108 --> 01:37:48.407
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.

01:37:48.512 --> 01:37:50.503
Been unable to receive you by radio.

01:37:50.614 --> 01:37:52.673
Cannot take bearing on you.

01:37:52.783 --> 01:37:54.774
If you can hear this,
please take bearing on us.

01:37:54.885 --> 01:37:56.113
Earhart's signal strength 4.

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.415
Please take bearing on us
and report in half an hour.

01:37:58.655 --> 01:38:03.820
We'll make noise in microphone.
We are about 100 miles out.

01:38:03.927 --> 01:38:05.053
Over.

01:38:05.762 --> 01:38:07.593
She's got to stay on longer.

01:38:07.698 --> 01:38:09.859
On air too briefly, bearing's impossible.

01:38:45.569 --> 01:38:47.298
Maybe her Morse receiver's out.

01:38:48.472 --> 01:38:51.032
King How Able Queen Queen.
This is Itasca.

01:38:51.141 --> 01:38:54.668
Can't take bearing on 3105.
Please send on 500.

01:38:54.778 --> 01:38:57.269
Or do you want to take bearing on us?
Over.

01:39:25.242 --> 01:39:28.234
Intercom top deck.
Double-check the smoke stack.

01:39:28.345 --> 01:39:30.711
O'Hare to top deck. Top deck, come in.

01:39:36.486 --> 01:39:38.613
They should
be able to see that for 20 miles at least.

01:39:52.569 --> 01:39:55.834
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.

01:39:55.939 --> 01:39:58.169
We must be on you, but cannot see you.

01:39:58.642 --> 01:40:02.840
Fuel is running low.
Been unable to receive you by radio.

01:40:03.347 --> 01:40:07.306
We are flying at altitude 1,000 feet. Over.

01:40:07.417 --> 01:40:13.014
We are receiving you and transmitting on
3105 and 500 consistently. Over.

01:40:32.142 --> 01:40:35.669
Itasca, we are circling,
but cannot hear you. Over.

01:40:36.279 --> 01:40:39.942
King How Able Queen Queen,
this is Itasca. Your signal is strong.

01:40:40.183 --> 01:40:41.707
Are you receiving this? Over.

01:40:44.721 --> 01:40:47.246
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.

01:40:47.357 --> 01:40:49.951
We received your signal,
but unable to take bearing.

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:55.896
Please take bearing on us
and answer on 3105 with voice. Over.

01:40:56.033 --> 01:40:57.625
Your signal received okay.

01:40:57.734 --> 01:41:03.104
It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105
on your voice.

01:41:03.206 --> 01:41:05.265
Send us a longer transmission,
please. Over.

01:41:10.647 --> 01:41:13.480
A report has come in
from the ship for Mr. Putnam.

01:41:13.583 --> 01:41:14.880
Oh, God.

01:41:15.419 --> 01:41:19.185
Miss Earhart has
finally received transmission from Itasca.

01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:29.358
Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.

01:41:29.466 --> 01:41:32.731
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?

01:41:32.836 --> 01:41:35.634
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.

01:41:35.739 --> 01:41:38.708
It was left on all night,
so we can't track her.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.547
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.

01:41:48.618 --> 01:41:52.213
Earhart, will you
please come in and reply on 500?

01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:58.391
We are transmitting constantly on 7500

01:41:58.495 --> 01:42:01.225
and we cannot hear you on 500.

01:42:20.784 --> 01:42:22.274
Despite constant attempts,

01:42:22.385 --> 01:42:26.685
the USS Itasca
has lost contact with Amelia Earhart.

01:42:28.492 --> 01:42:29.754
Come on.

01:42:37.834 --> 01:42:39.233
Come on.

01:42:39.469 --> 01:42:42.404
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.

01:42:42.506 --> 01:42:46.237
We are on the position line 157-337.

01:42:46.576 --> 01:42:49.238
We are running north and south.

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:52.408
Over.

01:42:52.516 --> 01:42:55.178
We hear you. We hear you.
Are you receiving us?

01:43:13.203 --> 01:43:16.036
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?

01:43:51.341 --> 01:43:53.832
Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.

01:44:21.037 --> 01:44:24.666
All the things
I never said for so very long,

01:44:26.076 --> 01:44:29.739
look up, they're in my eyes.

01:44:43.159 --> 01:44:47.687
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.596
Is it reckless? Maybe.

01:44:56.206 --> 01:44:59.039
But what do dreams know of boundaries?

01:45:30.106 --> 01:45:32.768
I think about the hands I have held,

01:45:35.845 --> 01:45:37.904
the places I've seen,

01:45:41.584 --> 01:45:45.486
the vast lands whose dirt is
caked on the bottom of my shoes.

01:46:09.679 --> 01:46:12.273
The world has changed me.
