SHE BABYSAT, WE CAME HOME,

11:29.259 --> 11:32.993
FOUND HER DRUNK
AND PASSED OUT ON THE COUCH,

IN HER HAND.

GEORGE, CALM DOWN.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.501

WEAR THONGS!

BEHIND OUR BACKS.

15:36.206 --> 15:37.567
WELL, I TOLD YOU NO ONE´S HOME.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.009
I´LL WAIT OUT FRONT.

15:39.009 --> 15:40.510

ON HER FACE

SHE´S GROUNDED FOR A YEAR.

YOU CAN´T DO THAT.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.215
WHY NOT?

15:45.215 --> 15:51.251
BECAUSE I GAVE HER PERMISSION
TO WEAR THE UNDERWEAR.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.383
WHAT?! WHEN?!

15:53.383 --> 15:56.586
AFTER WE DISCUSSED IT.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.533
I TOLD YOU --
YOU JUST DON´T REMEMBER.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.595

OH, NO.
NOT THIS TIME, ANGIE.

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WORK

16:14.244 --> 16:16.006
OR FAMILY OR YOUR FEELINGS.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.412
BUT YOU SAY THE WORD

MELTS AWAY.

BEHIND MY BACK,

16:28.688 --> 16:31.091
AND WORSE,
YOU´RE LYING ABOUT IT.

ISN´T A BIG DEAL ANYMORE.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.705
YOU´RE SPICING UP
A 16-YEAR-OLD MARRIAGE.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.278
WHEN CARMEN WEARS A THONG,
SHE´S STARTING A PEP RALLY

16:48.278 --> 16:51.281
IN EVERY 16-YEAR-OLD
BOY´S PANTS.

16:55.645 --> 16:57.687
THIS ISN´T ABOUT SEX.

16:57.687 --> 17:00.350
IT´S ABOUT PANTY LINES.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.521
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.453
YOU CAN BE SO RIGID
SOMETIMES.

17:03.453 --> 17:08.358
IT´S THE TREE THAT BENDS
THAT DOESN´T BREAK.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.029
YEAH?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.601
AND THERE´S THAT TREE THAT´S
BENDING OVER WEARING A THONG

17:11.601 --> 17:14.434
´CAUSE THAT´S THE TREE
ALL THE MONKEYS ARE CLIMBING ON.

17:16.466 --> 17:17.707
ONE THING.

17:17.707 --> 17:19.469
I DID ONE THING
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

17:19.469 --> 17:22.142
AND WHAT ABOUT CARMEN´S
NEW CELLPHONE?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.543
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

17:27.217 --> 17:30.720
THE PHONE IS FREE.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.282
LOOK, IT´S NO WONDER

17:32.282 --> 17:33.723
THE KIDS THINK THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

17:33.723 --> 17:36.156
BECAUSE WHEN I TELL THEM NO,
YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK,

17:36.156 --> 17:37.727
AND YOU TELL ´EM YES.

17:37.727 --> 17:39.058
WELL, I CAN´T HELP IT.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.360
THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED,

17:40.360 --> 17:42.792
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IS
TO SAY NO AND TO PUNISH,

17:42.792 --> 17:44.134
AND THAT´S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.835

GONNA WALK ALL OVER US.

I´M SORRY.

17:56.546 --> 18:00.210
FROM NOW ON, WE DON´T GO
BEHIND EACH OTHER´S BACKS.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.182
WE FIGHT UNTIL SOMEONE WINS.

18:09.219 --> 18:10.520
ALL RIGHT, LET´S GET IT ON.

18:12.362 --> 18:15.094
CARMEN DOESN´T WEAR A THONG,
AND YOU TAKE BACK THAT PHONE.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.466
OKAY.
THE PHONE GOES BACK,

18:16.466 --> 18:18.698
AND CARMEN GETS TO WEAR
A THONG WHEN SHE´S 16.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.769
47.

18:19.769 --> 18:21.231
17.

18:21.231 --> 18:26.376
66, AND IT´S
A RETIREMENT THONG.

18:26.876 --> 18:28.708
18, SHE SHOULD BE
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.610
AND SHE´LL BE ABLE TO WEAR
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.841
FINE.

18:31.841 --> 18:33.383
IF SHE REALLY MOVES OUT
WHEN SHE´S 18,

18:33.383 --> 18:34.614
SHE CAN WEAR
PLASTIC WRAP AND A CRACKER.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.447
FOR ALL I CARE.

18:43.893 --> 18:47.627
APPARENTLY, SOME OF MY CLEANING
PRODUCTS BURN THE SKIN.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.499
OH-HOO-HOO.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.164

18:54.834 --> 18:56.566
OH, RELAX, THEY´RE FINE.

18:56.566 --> 18:59.609
WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE,
THE BOY WAS REWIRING A LAMP,

18:59.609 --> 19:02.572
AND THE GIRL WAS SITTING
ON THE COUCH SOBBING.

19:02.572 --> 19:04.174
YOU KNOW, KID STUFF.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.676
ALL RIGHT,
LET´S GO GET ´EM.

19:06.676 --> 19:08.348
OH, HEY, MOM, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

19:08.718 --> 19:10.149
HUH?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.881
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT A TEENAGE GIRL

19:11.881 --> 19:13.353
WEARING THONG UNDERWEAR?

19:13.353 --> 19:16.926
WELL, I USED TO THINK
IT WAS PRETTY TRASHY,

19:16.926 --> 19:19.629
BUT RANDY LIKES IT,
AND...

19:24.464 --> 19:27.337
IT´S PRETTY DAMN
COMFORTABLE.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.407
YOU´RE RIGHT.
THEY´RE NOT SEXUAL AT ALL.

WHAT´S GOING ON?

19:53.623 --> 19:54.624
SIT DOWN.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.266
YEAH, SIT DOWN.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.901
WE WANTED TO SHOW HOW MUCH
WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.734
WE´RE SORRY
FOR HOW WE ACTED.

20:04.734 --> 20:05.775
OHH.

20:05.775 --> 20:08.478
HUH.

20:08.478 --> 20:12.482
SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THESE CHILDREN
HAVE LEARNED A LESSON.

20:12.482 --> 20:15.415

AT YOUR MOM´S

20:15.415 --> 20:17.417
DID DO THEM SOME GOOD.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.551
ANGIE, EVERYTHING´S PERFECT.
THE KIDS MADE US DINNER.

20:21.551 --> 20:23.323
THEY LEARNED THEIR LESSON,

20:23.323 --> 20:26.856
AND CARMEN´S NOT WEARING
A THONG ANYMORE.

20:26.856 --> 20:28.258

20:31.831 --> 20:34.734
ALL RIGHT, WE MADE YOU

20:37.567 --> 20:40.710
OH, EVERYTHING LOOKS
DELICIOUS, GUYS.

20:40.710 --> 20:44.714
OOH.
IT´S A LITTLE GARLICKY.
