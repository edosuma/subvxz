WEBVTT

00:07.307 --> 00:08.831
For our third course...

00:08.942 --> 00:10.102
Another course!

00:10.176 --> 00:13.339
Luhvian quail in truffle sauce,

00:13.413 --> 00:16.610
served with roasted chadre kab.

00:18.551 --> 00:21.714
My compliments to the chef.

00:21.788 --> 00:22.914
Hear, hear.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.821
Thank you, Captain.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.623
Cream of leola soup, fettran
risotto, Luhvian quail...

00:29.696 --> 00:31.186
it just keeps getting better.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.129
l knew you'd been
expanding your palate,

00:33.199 --> 00:35.633
but l didn't realize
you'd become a gourmet cook.

00:35.735 --> 00:39.831
Preparing meals myself is
the best way to ensure quality.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.804
l suppose l should be insulted,

00:41.875 --> 00:43.775
but everything is so delicious,

00:43.843 --> 00:47.279
l may just have to admit defeat
and hang up my apron.

00:47.347 --> 00:50.612
No, that'd be a real tragedy,
Neelix.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.509
Pinot noir, Commander?

00:53.586 --> 00:55.554
l'll have another glass
of the chardonnay.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.988
Each course has been paired
with a specific wine.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.685
Substitutions
are not recommended.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.989
The pinot noir sounds perfect.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.552
ls there any salt?

01:03.630 --> 01:06.565
Additional seasoning
is not required.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.066
Oh, l'm sorry, l...

01:08.168 --> 01:10.534
lf the quail hasn't been
prepared to your satisfaction,

01:10.603 --> 01:12.833
l could replicate something
more to your liking.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.907
A peanut butter
and jelly sandwich, perhaps.

01:15.008 --> 01:18.876
Actually, it's delicious
just the way it is.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.808
Captain to the Bridge.
Report.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.146
We're being pulled off-course.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.208
How?

01:27.287 --> 01:28.549
l'm not certain.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.953
lt appears to be
some kind of graviton surge.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.956
On my way.

01:36.963 --> 01:39.955
We've rerouted all available
power to the thrusters,

01:40.100 --> 01:41.590
but we can't break free.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.396
Try reversing
the shield polarity.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.470
No effect.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.526 --> 02:08.221
What happened to the stars?

04:01.608 --> 04:03.542
Shields at 65 percent!

04:03.610 --> 04:04.702
Hail them.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.210
They're not responding.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.746
Return fire.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.877
Can you identify them?

04:11.951 --> 04:13.851
Their weapon signature
is Vaadwaur,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.718
but the ship has technology
from several different species.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.346
There's another vessel
approaching.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.358
lt's charging weapons.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.087
Evasive pattern Beta-6.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.900
Maybe we've got an ally.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.664
The Vaadwaur ship is retreating.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.102
Hail the second ship.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.739
No response.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.904
l stand corrected.

04:44.384 --> 04:47.251
They have penetrated
our aft shields.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.880
Reroute power to the auxiliary
emitters and return fire.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.059
They've transported material
off Decks 5, 7 and 8.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.726
Disable their engines.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.242
Follow them.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.210
Navigational sensors
are malfunctioning.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.109
Something to do
with this environment.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.148
l want a full damage report
and an inventory

05:16.215 --> 05:18.183
of everything that was
taken off this ship.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.878
And l want to know where we are.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.386
They got more than 90 percent
of our food stores,

05:22.455 --> 05:25.356
including almost everything
in the Airponics Bay.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.859
They also got a computer console
from Engineering,

05:27.927 --> 05:30.521
and they emptied three
of our deuterium tanks.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.689
Why would anyone
steal deuterium?

05:32.765 --> 05:34.426
You could find it anywhere.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.468
Apparently not here.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.935
l'm not detecting any gases,

05:38.037 --> 05:40.096
stellar bodies,
or matter of any kind.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.265
Except for the ships
that attacked us.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.672
Scan for other vessels.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.177
l want to know how many
we're dealing with.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.805
There are more than 150 ships
within scanning range,

05:48.881 --> 05:51.349
but l'm only detecting
life signs on 29 of them.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.284
Captain, there's another vessel
approaching at high impulse.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.117
Quite a welcoming committee
they've got here.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.850
What's the status
of our shields?

05:57.924 --> 05:58.948
They're at 28 percent.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.389
That'll have to do.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.552
Charge weapons.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.322
Captain, this one wants to talk.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.728
On screen.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.124
l'm Captain Janeway

06:08.234 --> 06:10.293
of the Starship Voyager.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.371
General Valen.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.201
Welcome to the Void.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.504
You're the first ship
we've seen here

06:18.578 --> 06:20.045
that hasn't tried to fire on us,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.375
but in case you change
your mind,

06:21.447 --> 06:23.438
we're prepared
to defend ourselves.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.212
l know; l've been observing you
on sensors.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.516
The way you fought those ships
was impressive.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.649
Most vessels don't survive
the first few minutes.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.024
l'd appreciate any information
you could give us

06:36.095 --> 06:38.359
about where we are.

06:38.431 --> 06:41.093
The anomaly's
a closed structure,

06:41.167 --> 06:44.227
encased by an inert layer
of subspace.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.737
Matter and energy
can't penetrate it.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.036
Our ships certainly
penetrated it

06:49.108 --> 06:50.666
when we were pulled in.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.642
By the funnels.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.407
But they only pull matter
in one direction:

06:57.483 --> 06:58.916
into the Void.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.510
Have you explored
the entire anomaly?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.249
There's nothing to explore,
but it's big.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.917
We've calculated
the outer circumference

07:06.993 --> 07:09.188
at approximately
nine light-years,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.560
but we've never been able
to breach it.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.461
How long have you been here?

07:13.966 --> 07:16.230
More than five years.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.565
There must be a way to escape.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.231
New arrivals are always
thinking about escape.

07:21.340 --> 07:25.242
We have
a sophisticated starship.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.337
Maybe if we work together,
we can find a way out.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.245
You're being naive.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.341
No one ever gets out.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.784
We may be able
to devise a new approach.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.549
Many have tried.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.214
All they did was waste resources

07:38.291 --> 07:40.885
that could've
kept them alive longer.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.393
Don't be foolish.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.191
l can help you.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.560
How?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.099
The only source
of food and energy in the Void

07:48.201 --> 07:50.294
comes from new ships
that are drawn in.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.768
lf you want to survive here,

07:51.838 --> 07:55.239
you'll have to compete
for their resources.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.607
And l suppose
you can help us do that.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.306
l have tactical data

08:01.380 --> 08:03.439
on some of the more dangerous
predators.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.781
But you want something
in return.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.181
My scans show
you have photon torpedoes.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.523
l'm sorry,
we don't trade weapons.

08:15.595 --> 08:16.960
Why not?

08:17.029 --> 08:18.326
Because we have
no way of knowing

08:18.397 --> 08:19.989
what they'll be used for.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.524
Plundering innocent ships,
for example.

08:23.636 --> 08:27.504
Wait a few weeks until
your resources start to run out.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.770
Morality won't keep your
life support systems running.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.105
l'm sorry, General.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.908
There are some compromises
l won't make.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.578
Not yet.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.560
Report, Lieutenant.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.070
We're using power at almost
ten times the usual rate.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.627
While we're standing still?

08:59.739 --> 09:02.105
The same graviton forces
that pulled us into the anomaly

09:02.208 --> 09:03.698
seem to be draining
the warp core.

09:03.776 --> 09:07.803
At this rate, our deuterium
will be gone in about ten days.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.074
Shut down all
nonessential systems.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.207
Where are you going?

09:11.284 --> 09:14.412
To find a way out of here.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.012
Using fractal algorithms
with the Borg sensors,

09:17.089 --> 09:18.818
l believe l can predict
where and when

09:18.891 --> 09:20.324
these funnels will occur.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.157
Well, that's impressive,
but how does it help us?

09:23.229 --> 09:25.823
The funnels originate
inside the anomaly,

09:25.898 --> 09:28.958
creating massive graviton forces
before they erupt.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.332
lf we were to enter
one of the funnels

09:31.437 --> 09:33.098
just as that happened,

09:33.205 --> 09:34.763
we might be able
to use those forces

09:34.874 --> 09:36.239
to propel us into normal space.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.869
Not without compromising
structural integrity.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.743
l might be able to reinforce
the shields to compensate.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.304
There's another problem.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.442
When the graviton forces
reach critical levels,

09:46.519 --> 09:48.544
the polarity suddenly reverses,

09:48.621 --> 09:49.883
pulling everything
near the funnel

09:49.956 --> 09:51.184
back into the anomaly.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.725
We'd have to jump to warp
at exactly the right moment.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.819
We'd need to achieve
a velocity of warp 8.2.

09:56.896 --> 10:00.263
Question is,
will we have enough power?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.062
At the rate we're losing it...

10:03.936 --> 10:06.769
...we may only get
one shot at this.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.137
The sooner we try, the better.

10:15.348 --> 10:19.307
There's a funnel forming
70,000 meters off the port bow--

10:19.385 --> 10:21.182
bearing 130 mark 24.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.881
Graviton surge in 34 seconds.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.857
Full power to shields
and structural integrity.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.757
Take us in, Mr. Paris.

10:33.833 --> 10:34.765
Five seconds...

10:34.834 --> 10:35.892
four...

10:36.002 --> 10:37.060
three...

10:42.441 --> 10:44.204
Structural integrity
at 20 percent.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.181
Ten percent!

10:52.585 --> 10:54.450
50,000 kilometers
to normal space.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.782
Prepare to go to warp.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.875
Engineering to the Bridge.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.106
Go ahead.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.979
The warp core is off-line.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.619
lf nothing else,
we learned some things

11:35.695 --> 11:37.458
that'll help us next time.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.622
With all due respect, Captain,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.632
we don't even have
warp drive anymore.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.463
l may be able
to get it back on line,

11:42.568 --> 11:43.796
but we still need deuterium

11:43.903 --> 11:45.837
to keep our basic systems
running.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.463
How long will our reserves last?

11:47.573 --> 11:50.337
lf we shut down life support
on all but a few decks,

11:50.409 --> 11:52.172
deactivate Astrometrics,
turbolifts,

11:52.244 --> 11:55.839
ration replicator
use-- maybe a week.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.349
l used to make a living
scavenging for supplies.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.850
Let me take one of the shuttles.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.716
l might be able to find
deuterium

12:01.821 --> 12:03.083
on one of those abandoned ships.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.056
A shuttle would be
too easy a target.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.557
l appreciate the offer, Neelix,

12:06.625 --> 12:08.217
but we're safer
if we stay together.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.558
The shuttles may be useful
in another capacity.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.996
We could use their warp cores
to augment power on Voyager.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.296
We're still going to need
more deuterium.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.899
Let's track down
the ship that raided us

12:21.040 --> 12:23.508
and get back what they stole.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.837
We should do it quickly.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.401
l've detected a number
of vessels monitoring us.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.380
The vultures are circling.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.848
Vultures eat the dead,
Mr. Paris.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.852
We're not dead yet.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.959
The vessel's in visual range.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.323
Shields.

12:43.395 --> 12:46.887
On screen.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.366
Looks like somebody got to them
before we did.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.097
No life signs.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.365
Scan for ion trails.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.101
Whoever did this
probably has our deuterium.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.643
Aye, Captain.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.771
ls there anything left aboard
that ship worth salvaging?

13:01.847 --> 13:05.248
Their technology and supplies
have been picked clean.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.444
Not everything of value
has been taken.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.181
The warp core has been removed,

13:09.255 --> 13:11.621
but the casing
that protected it is intact.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.214
lt's composed of tricesium.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.886
We can convert it
into a power source.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.428
Every little bit helps.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.897
Lock onto the core casing
and beam it to the Cargo Bay.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.432
With the additional power,

13:22.535 --> 13:24.765
we could reactivate
the Astrometrics Lab.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.599
l can think of some better uses.

13:26.705 --> 13:27.637
For example?

13:27.706 --> 13:28.730
Oh, l don't know--

13:28.841 --> 13:31.002
making sure
there's air to breathe.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.384
This must be where they cut
through the casing

13:49.461 --> 13:50.723
to remove the core.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.957
Crude but effective.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.003
Something's in there.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.402
ldentify yourself.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.970
Torres to Security.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.475
lntruder alert.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.135
Acknowledged.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.577
There.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.082
Stay where you are.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.584
He appears to be injured.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.169
How is he?

14:31.237 --> 14:32.898
His injury doesn't seem serious,

14:33.005 --> 14:35.974
but he won't let me
close enough to treat him.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.739
My name's Captain Janeway.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.213
You're safe here.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.512
l've tried
communicating with him.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.950
He doesn't appear to
have any verbal skills.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.681
Do we know how he got on board?

14:49.755 --> 14:52.781
l believe he was transported
along with the core casing.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.190
We should have
picked up his life signs.

14:55.261 --> 14:58.287
We're trying to determine
why we didn't detect him.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.662
That vessel he was on
had no atmosphere.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.825
How did he survive?

15:01.967 --> 15:04.299
My scans show
he can conserve oxygen.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.132
He has unusually large
lung capacity

15:06.238 --> 15:07.762
and a voracious appetite.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.239
Do you think
that ship was his home?

15:10.309 --> 15:12.436
Maybe, but we can't
send him back.

15:12.511 --> 15:16.447
He can't survive without
oxygen indefinitely.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.847
We'll run scans for other
members of his species,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.443
but until we can find
a safe place for him,

15:21.520 --> 15:23.750
let's make him
as comfortable as possible.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.594
Computer, replicate a portion
of nutritional supplements

15:29.662 --> 15:30.959
from my daily allotment.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.896
You've found something?

15:42.007 --> 15:44.942
We think we know
who has our deuterium.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.979
lt's someone we've already met.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.941
l knew l'd see you again,
Captain.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.613
l expect you've reconsidered
my proposal.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.179
We're not here to trade.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.885
We're here to take back
what belongs to us.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.552
l don't know what you mean.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.529
Our scans indicate
you've got some of our food,

16:05.597 --> 16:06.825
one of our consoles,

16:06.932 --> 16:09.230
and a large quantity
of our deuterium.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.269
We didn't take
any of that from you.

16:11.337 --> 16:14.500
No, apparently you killed
the crew of another ship

16:14.606 --> 16:16.164
and took it from them.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.742
We want it back.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.278
That's not the way
things work here.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.782
Either you give it back,
or we'll take it.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.681
He's powering his engines.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.552
Target his shields and fire.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.052
Lock onto whatever belongs to us

16:35.127 --> 16:36.424
and transport it
to the cargo bay.

16:37.796 --> 16:41.562
l'm detecting large quantities
of food on his supply deck.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.760
Maybe we should take it
while we have the chance.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.564
ls it ours?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.434
No, but our own reserves
are running out.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.306
Valen wouldn't hesitate
to take it from us.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.311
No, he wouldn't.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.903
We've got what's ours.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.277
Reverse course.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.853
Come in.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.529
An updated inventory
of our supplies.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.569
We got back less than half
of what was stolen.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.465
Doesn't take two of you
to deliver a padd.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.769
What's on your mind?

17:26.512 --> 17:27.569
We want to be clear

17:27.646 --> 17:29.307
about what our policy's
going to be

17:29.381 --> 17:30.780
while we're here in the Void.

17:30.849 --> 17:34.012
You think we should
have taken Valen's food.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.554
Logic suggests we may have to be

17:36.622 --> 17:38.886
more opportunistic
if we intend to survive.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.891
We may not like Valen's tactics,

17:40.959 --> 17:42.722
but he and his crew
are still alive

17:42.795 --> 17:44.285
after five years in here.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.593
l was thinking
about that myself.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.392
l thought maybe
l could get some guidance

17:50.502 --> 17:52.470
from the Federation Charter.

17:53.672 --> 17:57.267
l was hoping l'd find a loophole
that would allow us to...

17:57.342 --> 18:00.334
take actions
we ordinarily wouldn't take.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.141
Any luck?

18:02.214 --> 18:04.705
The Charter's
a statement of principles,

18:04.783 --> 18:06.410
not a practical document.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.976
No section on how to exist
in a void.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.351
No.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.354
But l've become convinced

18:13.425 --> 18:15.586
that we've got to stick
to our principles,

18:15.661 --> 18:16.923
not abandon them.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.429
Should the crew be ready
to die for those principles?

18:19.498 --> 18:21.022
lf the alternative means

18:21.100 --> 18:23.830
becoming thieves
and killers ourselves, yes.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.130
But l'm betting
that our principles

18:26.238 --> 18:28.001
are going to keep us alive.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.165
Captain?

18:29.274 --> 18:33.574
The Federation is based
on mutual cooperation...

18:33.645 --> 18:35.613
the idea that the whole
is greater

18:35.681 --> 18:37.239
than the sum of its parts.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.807
Voyager can't
survive here alone,

18:39.885 --> 18:43.878
but if we form a temporary
alliance with other ships,

18:43.989 --> 18:46.549
maybe we can pool
our resources and escape.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.990
As you've pointed out,

18:48.060 --> 18:50.460
the people we've encountered
in this void

18:50.529 --> 18:51.894
are thieves and killers.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.898
Such individuals
are hardly ideal allies.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.695
l agree.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.703
Then who are we going
to form an alliance with?

18:59.771 --> 19:03.138
Anyone who agrees
to play by our rules:

19:03.242 --> 19:07.611
no killing, no stealing,
and no giving up.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.908
Forgive me, Captain,

19:08.981 --> 19:11.074
but why would anyone
who has survived

19:11.150 --> 19:14.347
by killing and stealing
suddenly agree to those terms?

19:14.419 --> 19:18.412
We'll offer to share
our food and medical supplies

19:18.490 --> 19:22.187
and defend ships
that are attacked by raiders.

19:22.261 --> 19:25.822
Captain, maybe you'd better take
another look at that inventory.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.195
Our food and power reserves
will be gone within a week.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.394
lf we start giving
everything away...

19:31.503 --> 19:34.870
Then maybe we'll only survive
for two days instead of seven.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.874
On the other hand,
if we share what we have,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.704
instead of hoarding it,

19:38.777 --> 19:41.644
we might find other people
willing to do the same.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.408
lf we combine our technology,

19:43.482 --> 19:46.383
we can find ways
of improving our situation

19:46.451 --> 19:50.888
and ultimately
get the hell out of this place.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.891
We may lose a little weight,
gentlemen,

19:53.992 --> 19:57.587
but we won't lose who we are.

20:01.633 --> 20:06.229
Captain's Log, Stardate 54553.4.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.102
For the past several days,
we've been making every effort

20:09.174 --> 20:11.267
to recruit members
into an alliance,

20:11.343 --> 20:13.334
but it hasn't been easy.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.108
Whenever a new ship
gets pulled into the Void,

20:16.181 --> 20:17.944
they're immediately attacked.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.449
lnstead of attacking it,

20:19.518 --> 20:22.316
you'd have to help
defend the new ship.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.617
And how is that in my interest?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.523
lt would encourage them
to join our alliance.

20:27.593 --> 20:31.359
And if they refuse,
then we raid them?

20:31.430 --> 20:32.954
Everyone in the
alliance must agree

20:33.031 --> 20:35.192
not to launch
unprovoked attacks.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.768
Then how are we supposed
to get supplies?

20:37.869 --> 20:39.962
The idea is to recruit
new members,

20:40.138 --> 20:42.003
share technology and resources.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.631
We almost escaped the Void
on our own.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.803
lf we work together,
l believe we'll succeed.

20:47.879 --> 20:51.212
How many ships do you have
in this alliance?

20:51.283 --> 20:53.148
You'd be the first.

20:53.218 --> 20:57.450
Technically, Captain,
that's not correct.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.649
l consider myself
the first member

20:59.725 --> 21:01.317
of the Captain's coalition.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.793
Six years ago,
l offered her my services

21:04.830 --> 21:05.888
and the resources of my ship,

21:06.031 --> 21:07.396
and she has never failed
to help me

21:07.466 --> 21:08.763
when l needed her.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.632
lt's a noble idea, Captain,

21:11.737 --> 21:15.434
but good intentions are
like deuterium reserves--

21:15.507 --> 21:18.067
they tend to get lost
in the Void.

21:18.143 --> 21:21.237
All l ask is that you consider
our proposal.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.941
l will.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.881
ln the meantime,

21:25.951 --> 21:28.681
we'd like to offer you
food and medical supplies.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.552
What do you expect in return?

21:31.623 --> 21:34.114
Nothing.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.183
Compliments of the alliance.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.734
l tried.

21:50.075 --> 21:51.440
Captain...

21:51.510 --> 21:52.499
there's been a theft.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.669
What's missing?

21:53.745 --> 21:54.677
My phase compensator.

21:54.746 --> 21:55.838
No doubt, it was stolen

21:55.914 --> 21:57.609
by one of your
prospective members.

21:57.683 --> 22:00.208
lt wasn't stolen.
l gave it to the Nygeans.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.219
They needed it
to repair their sensor array.

22:02.287 --> 22:05.381
l presume you obtained something
equally valuable in return.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.890
l think l did.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.721
The goodwill
of a potential ally.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.056
Did they join?

22:10.128 --> 22:11.060
Not yet.

22:11.129 --> 22:13.563
-Captain...
-l know.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.294
lt's not exactly
the most ''efficient'' policy.

22:16.401 --> 22:19.768
But, then, you don't always do
what's most efficient either.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.601
l don't know
what you're implying.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.608
You gave up your rations
to our guest in Sick Bay.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.109
He needed food.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.772
You're a valuable
member of this crew.

22:28.847 --> 22:29.814
Your friend in Sick Bay

22:29.881 --> 22:31.439
is nothing but a drain
on resources.

22:31.516 --> 22:35.612
What's efficient about
wasting food on him?

22:35.687 --> 22:37.416
You think l'm being inefficient,

22:37.489 --> 22:39.616
Tuvok thinks
l'm being illogical...

22:39.691 --> 22:41.124
You both could be right.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.459
But maybe the best way
to get help is to give it.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.963
Oh, and, Seven?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.659
-Yes?
-l'm sorry

22:48.734 --> 22:51.532
l gave away your favorite
phase compensator.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.054
How is he?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.389
Much better.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.553
He seemed to relax
when he heard me

23:17.629 --> 23:19.062
humming an aria from Rigoletto,

23:19.131 --> 23:22.066
so l had the computer play
the full orchestral version.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.727
Fantome seems to be
a music lover.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.064
''Fantome''?

23:26.171 --> 23:27.604
After The Phantom of the Opera,

23:27.672 --> 23:30.732
a tormented character
who is soothed by music.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.675
ln six years, you haven't chosen
a name for yourself,

23:33.745 --> 23:36.270
but you've given Fantome one
in a few days.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.280
Choosing the right name
for myself

23:37.349 --> 23:38.441
is extremely difficult.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.382
l'm a complex individual.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.942
And Fantome isn't?

23:42.020 --> 23:43.282
On the contrary.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.050
l believe
he's quite intelligent,

23:45.123 --> 23:47.250
and his physiology's
very sophisticated.

23:47.325 --> 23:49.555
Did you know he has
the ability to refract

23:49.628 --> 23:50.595
his own life signs?

23:50.662 --> 23:51.629
That would explain

23:51.696 --> 23:53.288
why our sensors
didn't detect him.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.565
l wish we could find a way
to communicate with him.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.070
l suspect he'd have
a lot to tell us.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.210
We were enjoying that.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.576
Exactly.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.639
He may not be able to speak,
but he can hear.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.601
He understands.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.414
So it would seem.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.381
What's the occasion?

24:53.458 --> 24:55.255
Seven's not the only one

24:55.327 --> 24:58.057
who knows how
to set an elegant table.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.996
You have heard
there is a food shortage.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.328
That's no reason

25:02.400 --> 25:05.563
why you two can't enjoy
a romantic dinner.

25:07.305 --> 25:10.138
Unfortunately,
l can't light this.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.369
lt would be a waste of oxygen.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.378
Still, it is festive.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.243
We appreciate the effort.

25:18.116 --> 25:20.778
l believe there's been
a mistake here, waiter.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.149
l didn't order this.

25:22.220 --> 25:27.317
Close your eyes and pretend that
it's Seven's fettran risotto.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.464
lt tastes more like chicken.

25:40.906 --> 25:41.998
What's this?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.337
A preserved Olian guava.

25:44.409 --> 25:45.899
l had a few left.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.773
Neelix...

25:47.846 --> 25:50.144
No arguments.
You're eating for two.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.446
Senior officers,
report to stations immediately.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.780
Sorry, Neelix.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.055
Charge weapons.
Shields to full.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.055
What's going on?

25:59.124 --> 26:00.182
A funnel just opened.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.759
lt pulled in a new vessel.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.693
Two warships are approaching it.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.195
One of them is Valen's.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.096
Target Valen's weapons
and hail him.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.503
My fight's not with you,
Captain.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.270
Then stand down.

26:18.343 --> 26:21.540
This new ship has
impressive technology.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.137
We can share it.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.546
l'm not here
to divide the spoils.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.518
Then why are you here?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.351
To protect the ship
you're firing on.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.391
What are they to you?

26:33.458 --> 26:35.392
Just some people
in a bad situation,

26:35.460 --> 26:37.121
like the rest of us.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.890
Save your speeches.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.261
l've got a crew to feed.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.296
He's targeting our shields.

26:44.402 --> 26:45.426
Take his weapons out.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.504
Hail the new ship.

26:49.074 --> 26:49.938
l surrender.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.440
We're here to help you.

26:51.509 --> 26:53.170
Can you target
the smaller warship?

26:53.244 --> 26:56.236
We're a survey vessel.
We're not equipped to fight.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.409
Shields at 60 percent.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.782
Fire torpedoes.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.756
Shields on Valen's lead ship
are holding at 80 percent.

27:09.828 --> 27:12.626
lt appears he's upgraded them
since we last met.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.493
Ours?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.465
Thirty.

27:18.737 --> 27:22.468
The smaller ship
is outmaneuvering us.

27:22.540 --> 27:26.067
We have hull breaches
on Decks 5 and 6.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.008
Seal them.

27:27.078 --> 27:30.013
Shields at 15 percent.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.311
-Engineering to the Bridge.
-Go ahead.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.546
We're losing containment.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.055
At this rate,
we'll be dead in the water

27:39.124 --> 27:41.490
in less than three minutes.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.155
We should retreat, Captain.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.830
Not yet.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.092
We might want to reconsider.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.599
There's another ship
approaching.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.760
We can't defend ourselves
against three ships.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.337
We may not have to.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.429
The third vessel
belongs to Mr. Garon.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.201
He's firing at the other two.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.241
Valen's shields are down.

28:04.315 --> 28:06.579
The smaller ship
is leaking plasma.

28:06.651 --> 28:08.312
They're both retreating.

28:08.386 --> 28:09.648
Garon's hailing.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.211
Get a weapons lock on him.

28:11.289 --> 28:13.883
We've been fooled
by unexpected allies before.

28:16.294 --> 28:17.818
Why are you targeting me?

28:17.929 --> 28:19.988
Because l don't know
what your intentions are.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.760
Haven't l just made them clear?

28:23.201 --> 28:26.034
l've decided
to accept your offer.

28:29.607 --> 28:30.904
Well, in that case...

28:31.976 --> 28:35.912
...welcome to the alliance.

28:39.117 --> 28:43.213
Captain's Log, Stardate 54562.7.

28:43.288 --> 28:46.724
Since Garon and the survey ship
became our charter members,

28:46.791 --> 28:49.385
finding new allies
has gotten a little easier.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.726
My latest prospect
is Commander Bosaal,

28:52.797 --> 28:55.994
whose ship has technology
that could help us escape.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.592
Neelix, we have
another guest for dinner.

28:58.703 --> 29:01.536
Always room for one more,
Captain.

29:01.639 --> 29:04.506
Who did you raid
to get fresh vegetables?

29:04.542 --> 29:05.907
They're replicated.

29:05.977 --> 29:07.774
One of the crews that joined us

29:07.846 --> 29:10.940
had technology that tripled
our replicator efficiency.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.710
lt may not be a gourmet feast,

29:12.784 --> 29:15.776
but we can feed
500 people a day now,

29:15.854 --> 29:18.914
using half the power
it took us a few days ago.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.686
Why don't we sit down?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.493
Doctor.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.661
Hello, Commander.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.204
How's your patient?

29:34.272 --> 29:36.263
Technically, he's not
a patient anymore,

29:36.374 --> 29:37.932
but it's taken me
this long to coax him

29:38.042 --> 29:38.974
out of Sick Bay.

29:39.043 --> 29:40.510
He's quite shy.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.013
l'm telling him not to worry...

29:44.082 --> 29:46.812
that you're the one
who keeps us all safe.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.677
He says, ''Thank you.''

29:49.754 --> 29:52.518
An ingenious method
of communication.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.114
lt began
with a few simple words,

29:54.192 --> 29:56.592
but now we're capable
of rudimentary conversation.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.288
Tell him l'm pleased
he's feeling better.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.295
l will.

30:16.281 --> 30:19.717
What's that parasite
doing aboard your ship?

30:22.587 --> 30:24.612
l beg your pardon?

30:24.689 --> 30:26.384
They're vermin.

30:26.457 --> 30:28.288
l don't know who you are, sir,

30:28.359 --> 30:30.759
but your choice of words
is offensive.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.353
What is offensive is the way

30:32.430 --> 30:34.625
they slip aboard
during transport,

30:34.699 --> 30:38.260
hide in conduits,
steal food, spread disease.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.564
Fantome is perfectly healthy,

30:40.672 --> 30:43.266
and unlike some people
in this Void, he hasn't stolen

30:43.374 --> 30:45.239
anything.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.177
lf my sensors could detect
where they are on my ship,

30:48.246 --> 30:49.406
l'd exterminate them.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.005
l suggest you do the same.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.174
Captain, this is outrageous!

30:53.251 --> 30:54.240
Doctor!

31:00.758 --> 31:02.248
One of the principles
of our alliance

31:02.327 --> 31:04.295
is that we don't discriminate.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.989
Everyone's welcome,

31:06.064 --> 31:08.794
as long as they
follow the rules.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.062
But if you're having
a bad experience

31:11.169 --> 31:14.195
with the members of this species
on your ship,

31:14.305 --> 31:17.763
l'd be happy to bring
them to Voyager.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.810
lf you could find them.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.780
Now that we've had a chance to
analyze Fantome's physiology,

31:23.848 --> 31:26.840
l think we can get
a transporter lock on them.

31:26.918 --> 31:31.514
ls this your way of enticing me
to join your... alliance?

31:31.589 --> 31:33.614
l'm simply trying to demonstrate

31:33.691 --> 31:37.058
how cooperation and tolerance
can benefit everyone.

31:38.129 --> 31:41.223
Then we have an agreement.

31:46.237 --> 31:50.139
Okay, now connect
the primary emitter relay.

31:52.510 --> 31:53.977
On line.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.272
How is it coming?

31:55.346 --> 31:56.278
Pretty well.

31:56.347 --> 31:57.712
We just need to...

31:59.284 --> 32:01.377
l guess l was being
a little optimistic.

32:01.486 --> 32:02.885
What's the problem, exactly?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.980
Uh, we think we can establish
a shield bubble

32:05.056 --> 32:06.887
large enough to encompass
all our ships,

32:06.958 --> 32:09.051
but we have no way to compensate
for the graviton stress.

32:09.127 --> 32:12.392
Wouldn't a polaron modulator
be able to do that?

32:12.463 --> 32:13.896
Unfortunately, nobody
in the alliance has one.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.525
We've been trying to build
our own, but so far...

32:16.634 --> 32:18.625
Maybe we could trade
for one, or find

32:18.736 --> 32:19.862
a new ally who has one.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.939
Well, it's not a common piece
of technology,

32:22.006 --> 32:22.938
and it's valuable.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.634
lt may be difficult
to convince anyone

32:24.709 --> 32:25.835
to part with it.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.844
You never know unless you ask...

32:27.912 --> 32:28.936
You are not authorized
to be in here.

32:29.013 --> 32:31.607
We're making a valuable
contribution to the alliance.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.844
By spying
on restricted meetings?

32:33.918 --> 32:37.752
We've devised a new
surveillance technique.

32:37.822 --> 32:39.483
Ask Harry to give you a...

32:39.557 --> 32:41.184
You've bypassed
my security measures.

32:41.259 --> 32:44.558
We can observe activity
on any ship in the Void

32:44.629 --> 32:46.221
without being detected.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.698
This is the cargo hold
on the Jelinian freighter.

32:49.767 --> 32:53.328
Now, if l'm not mistaken,
the Jelinians

32:53.438 --> 32:54.905
are a member of our alliance.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.237
Which is why you shouldn't
be spying on them.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.301
And why they shouldn't
be hoarding their ale.

33:43.621 --> 33:44.849
Lovely piece.

33:44.922 --> 33:46.856
Did they compose it, or did you?

33:46.924 --> 33:48.255
They did.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.089
Though strictly speaking,
it's not a composition.

33:50.161 --> 33:52.322
lt's more of a conversation.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.625
l'm impressed.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.960
l wish l could take credit,

33:55.033 --> 33:56.557
but it was Fantome
who taught the others

33:56.667 --> 33:58.965
in a fraction of the time
it took him to learn.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.731
They're a highly
intelligent species.

34:00.838 --> 34:01.998
The language is
already developing

34:02.106 --> 34:04.165
its own grammar and syntax.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.709
That suggests they have
a language of their own.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.212
Mm-hmm. lt could be
telepathic, but they seem

34:09.280 --> 34:14.013
just as comfortable
communicating with music now.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.576
Could their species be native
to the Void?

34:16.654 --> 34:17.882
lt's certainly possible.

34:17.955 --> 34:19.684
They told us
they were born here.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.418
Just when you think
nothing in the galaxy

34:22.493 --> 34:24.290
can surprise you anymore...

34:24.362 --> 34:28.321
Captain Janeway, please report
to Engineering.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.762
Just what we needed, Captain--

34:35.873 --> 34:38.398
a fully compatible
polaron modulator.

34:38.509 --> 34:39.942
Where did you get it?

34:40.043 --> 34:41.875
A Kinjal frigate.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.811
Do they want to join
our alliance?

34:43.880 --> 34:46.213
They're not interested.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.310
How did you get this?

34:50.388 --> 34:51.650
l traded for it.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.485
What did you give them?

34:55.025 --> 34:56.994
l don't answer to you.

34:58.529 --> 35:01.362
Did you steal it?

35:04.969 --> 35:07.028
Disconnect the modulator.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.366
Captain...?

35:08.473 --> 35:10.805
We're returning it
to the people it belongs to.

35:10.875 --> 35:14.140
They have no more use for it.

35:14.212 --> 35:15.702
You don't know that.

35:15.780 --> 35:20.308
Yes... l do.

35:20.384 --> 35:22.249
You killed them...

35:22.320 --> 35:23.651
Captain.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.155
l don't like his tactics
any more than you do,

35:26.224 --> 35:29.216
but why waste this technology
when we're so close to escaping?

35:29.293 --> 35:30.555
Because it's a violation

35:30.628 --> 35:32.619
of everything
this alliance stands for.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.528
Refusing the modulator
won't bring back

35:34.599 --> 35:35.657
the people he killed.

35:35.733 --> 35:40.602
No, but using it would make us
accessories to murder.

35:40.671 --> 35:42.662
Take it and get out.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.666
The Jelinians and the Kraylor
have left with Bosaal.

36:14.772 --> 36:16.205
They felt you were being...

36:16.274 --> 36:18.208
lmpulsive and self-righteous?

36:18.276 --> 36:19.868
ls that what you think?

36:19.944 --> 36:21.878
You did what you had to do.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.379
Still, l made a mistake.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.108
By telling Bosaal to leave?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.878
Allowing him to join
in the first place.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.475
You couldn't have known
what he was going to do.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.021
Oh, l had a pretty good idea
what kind of person he was.

36:31.088 --> 36:33.386
That bigoted reaction he had
to the Doctor's friend

36:33.457 --> 36:37.723
told me all l needed to know,
but l ignored my instincts.

36:37.795 --> 36:38.887
Why?

36:38.963 --> 36:41.488
Because l thought his ship
could help us escape.

36:41.566 --> 36:44.228
You weren't the only one
who wanted him in the alliance.

36:44.335 --> 36:46.269
Maybe not...
but if l'd listened

36:46.337 --> 36:47.861
to my doubts in the first place,

36:47.972 --> 36:50.236
we wouldn't have lost
the other two ships.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.935
We'll find a way out
of here without them.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.442
Where do we stand
with the modulator?

36:53.511 --> 36:55.172
B'Elanna and the other engineers

36:55.246 --> 36:57.214
are working around
the clock to build one.

36:57.281 --> 37:00.512
She thinks they'll be ready
to test in a couple of days.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.645
So everyone's pulling together
to make up for my mistake?

37:03.721 --> 37:04.813
They have to.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.323
lt says so
in the Federation Charter.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.593
Good news, l hope.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.094
l'm afraid not.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.528
lt appears Commander Bosaal

37:13.598 --> 37:15.930
is attempting to form
an alliance of his own

37:16.033 --> 37:17.967
with one of our adversaries.

37:18.035 --> 37:20.026
We recorded a tactical
conversation

37:20.137 --> 37:23.197
that took place between them
just a few minutes ago.

37:23.307 --> 37:25.867
Don't underestimate Janeway.

37:25.943 --> 37:28.036
l've been in battle
with her twice.

37:28.112 --> 37:30.342
Then you know Janeway's tactics.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.972
l have two other ships.

37:32.049 --> 37:35.610
We can take Voyager's
food and weapons

37:35.686 --> 37:37.449
if we work together.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.614
The rest of their
conversation suggests

37:39.690 --> 37:41.783
they will attack
within the next 48 hours.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.726
l'm so glad we taught them
the value of cooperation.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.662
Our power reserves
will be severely depleted

37:47.732 --> 37:49.097
if we're forced
to defend ourselves.

37:50.534 --> 37:53.628
Tell B'Elanna we don't have time
to test her modulator.

37:53.738 --> 37:55.899
We've got to try to escape now.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.044
Sorry to interrupt, but we've
got a situation developing.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.343
We're going to try
to break free of the anomaly.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.114
Your friends are welcome
to join us,

38:10.187 --> 38:12.178
but they should be aware
of the dangers.

38:16.193 --> 38:17.353
The Void's their home.

38:17.428 --> 38:18.360
They want to stay.

38:18.429 --> 38:20.727
Where would they like us
to transport them?

38:20.798 --> 38:21.822
They're nomads.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.228
Any ship will do.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.267
They say they're grateful
for our help.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.941
They want to help us now.

39:46.684 --> 39:49.084
There's a funnel forming
in Grid 4.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.984
Graviton surge in 98 seconds.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.023
Alert the other ships.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.155
Take us in, Tom.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.524
Aye, Captain.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.688
Bosaal and his fleet
are approaching.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.288
They are charging weapons.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.696
Janeway to Engineering.

40:02.767 --> 40:03.699
Status.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.564
l need two more minutes.

40:05.669 --> 40:07.261
You've got one.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.245
Surge in 50 seconds!

40:16.313 --> 40:18.611
Voyager to all alliance ships.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.116
Begin firing
at your designated targets.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.718
We've penetrated shields
on both vessels.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.319
Janeway to the Doctor.

40:32.396 --> 40:33.761
lnitiate transport.

40:33.831 --> 40:35.662
Acknowledged.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.270
Yes. Good-bye and good luck.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.573
Energize.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.543
Transport complete, Captain.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.139
They're in the engine rooms
of both ships.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.275
Acknowledged.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.785
30 seconds.

40:56.854 --> 40:59.345
Janeway to Engineering.
We need that modulator.

40:59.423 --> 41:01.050
Just a few more seconds.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.897
We're receiving a hail
from Valen's ship-- audio only.

41:12.002 --> 41:13.230
Let's hear it.

41:15.339 --> 41:16.897
What's he saying, Doctor?

41:18.342 --> 41:19.673
Mission accomplished.

41:19.743 --> 41:22.143
Fantome shut down power
on Valen's ship.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.180
Confirmed.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.511
Bosaal's ship
has lost power, as well.

41:25.583 --> 41:28.450
Who says gremlins
in the engine are a myth.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.781
Surge in five seconds...

41:29.854 --> 41:30.786
four...

41:30.855 --> 41:32.152
Now, B'Elanna.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.856
All ships are in formation.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.231
Structural integrity
at 30 percent.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.600
40,000 meters to normal space.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.471
Twenty percent.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.067
Ten percent.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.278
Do it, Tom.

42:08.559 --> 42:12.461
Gentlemen, it's been a privilege
to have you as allies.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.464
l never believed we'd escape.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.466
Then why did you join?

42:16.534 --> 42:19.264
Captain Janeway
is very persuasive,

42:19.370 --> 42:20.894
and the food was good.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.403
You're welcome to have
a meal with us anytime.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.272
Ah, unfortunately, we're headed
in the opposite direction.

42:26.343 --> 42:28.573
Safe journey to you
and your crew, Captain.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.273
And to all of yours, as well.

42:30.347 --> 42:31.939
Thank you.

42:45.296 --> 42:49.232
lt was almost like being part
of the Federation again.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.428
The real one's only
30,000 light-years away.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.731
Then what are we
standing around for?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
