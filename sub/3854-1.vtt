00:37.217 --> 00:38.406
That's my boy.

00:38.562 --> 00:40.842
Spike, come here, boy!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.343
- Hey, watch it!
- Hey! What's the deal?

02:54.497 --> 02:56.232
Masher!

02:56.577 --> 02:58.793
Hey, get back here!

03:04.353 --> 03:06.404
Mama. Mama, look.

03:07.745 --> 03:09.350
That's great, honey.

03:50.593 --> 03:52.513
Hey, I'm sorry. He didn't mean any harm.

03:53.698 --> 03:56.425
It would seem
that Bandit is not a big fan of cats.

04:00.609 --> 04:02.279
Come on, Bandit. It's getting late.

04:02.434 --> 04:04.354
We have to get back to Quest Key
with the supplies.

04:05.793 --> 04:06.982
What are those?

04:10.657 --> 04:12.196
Hold on.

04:14.625 --> 04:17.156
Jeepers, let's get out of here.

04:18.017 --> 04:19.173
Let's go.

04:23.777 --> 04:25.381
Hey, look.

04:30.241 --> 04:31.397
What are they after?

04:31.553 --> 04:33.259
I think they're after us.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.378
- Whoa.
- Wow. Go, cat, go!

04:43.233 --> 04:45.219
Incoming!

04:49.986 --> 04:53.194
Come on, we gotta get back to the hydrofoil!

05:03.585 --> 05:04.741
Hey, wait up!

05:05.057 --> 05:06.563
- Mama, look.
- Agh!

05:06.721 --> 05:08.456
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry!

05:08.609 --> 05:11.490
Let Mama finish this chapter.

05:27.969 --> 05:29.224
Boat flares?

05:30.017 --> 05:31.271
They don't know that, Hadji.

05:31.425 --> 05:33.257
I do not think they care.

05:36.129 --> 05:38.148
Well, that didn't work.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.512
- Race.
- Quick, boys, get on!

05:45.666 --> 05:49.953
- You might wanna help your buddy.
- We would stay, but our ride is here.

05:50.913 --> 05:52.201
Who are these animals?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.542
They helped us, Race.

05:53.698 --> 05:56.392
Have you two ever been in a chase before?

06:01.793 --> 06:03.560
Hang on!

06:09.217 --> 06:11.049
Excellent throw, Jonny.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.479
Hey.

06:17.537 --> 06:19.010
Yeah.

06:31.713 --> 06:35.467
Impossible. Who is that amazing feline?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.651
And...

06:39.809 --> 06:42.875
Finished.
What did you want to show me, Floyd?

06:45.153 --> 06:47.355
Aw! I give up.

06:49.217 --> 06:52.677
So who's gonna tell the boss
Jonny Quest gave us the slip?

06:52.833 --> 06:56.674
- Not me. I like living.
- Yeah, I like living too. Long healthy life.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.495
Collect a pension. Pension.
Don't tell him. How is he gonna know?

06:59.649 --> 07:01.871
Because I know everything.

07:02.785 --> 07:09.026
I'll bet that Quest cat has coughed up
hair balls more effective than you three.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.665
<i>We can try again.</i>

07:10.817 --> 07:13.414
No, no, no. You missed your opportunity, no.

07:13.569 --> 07:14.988
I wanted the boys for bait...

07:15.137 --> 07:18.891
...and now it appears
you'll have to go after the big fish himself.

07:19.042 --> 07:24.170
And woe to you should you fail Dr. Zin again.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.376
Welcome to Quest Labs. Pretty cool, huh?

09:14.977 --> 09:18.152
- Hi, Dad.
- Jonny. Thank goodness you're all right.

09:18.305 --> 09:21.251
Uh... Yeah, well, we, uh...

09:21.409 --> 09:23.144
Should never wander off again.

09:23.297 --> 09:26.723
You know, there are a lot of people
who would like to get to me through you.

09:26.881 --> 09:29.346
Which is why you have to stay close to Race.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.109
He's here to protect us.

09:31.265 --> 09:33.862
We could've handled it with our new team.

09:35.873 --> 09:38.121
Yeah, the five musketeers.

09:38.273 --> 09:41.798
Or should I say, four and a half?

09:43.296 --> 09:45.064
What are your new friends' names?

09:45.761 --> 09:47.332
Oh. Uh...

09:47.489 --> 09:50.086
- Do you know, Hadji?
- Yes, yes, I believe so.

09:50.241 --> 09:54.278
Their names are Jerry and Thomas.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.070
Oh, so you must be Jerry...

09:56.417 --> 09:58.054
...and you are Tom.

10:02.273 --> 10:03.877
Oh, you're Tom...

10:04.033 --> 10:05.321
...and you're Jerry.

10:07.105 --> 10:10.149
I kind of liked it better my way. Huh?

10:21.409 --> 10:25.926
Stand back, everyone.
I'm going to activate the Q Sphere.

10:48.449 --> 10:51.176
Extraordinary.
According to the Questometer...

10:51.329 --> 10:56.075
...the Q Sphere has enough power
to run a small city indefinitely.

10:56.225 --> 10:59.051
Sure sounds like you solved
the world's energy problems, Dad.

10:59.201 --> 11:02.278
Yes, but if someone evil
were to get their hands on it...

11:02.433 --> 11:04.866
...there is no telling the destruction
they could cause.

11:05.025 --> 11:06.182
You're right, Hadji.

11:06.337 --> 11:09.064
But we mustn't let fear
stand in the way of science.

11:09.217 --> 11:10.854
Or dinner, for that matter.

11:11.264 --> 11:14.538
- Who's hungry?
- I am. I can smell it from here.

11:15.553 --> 11:17.386
That's not dinner.

11:26.976 --> 11:29.442
No, not that pot.

11:34.785 --> 11:38.596
Well, I'm definitely not in the mood
for barbecue.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.419
Wow, Pop, this is delicious.

11:45.089 --> 11:48.199
Oh, don't thank me. Race did all the cooking.

11:48.352 --> 11:50.055
Any more for you, Hadji?

11:50.209 --> 11:54.214
Oh. No, thank you.
I couldn't eat another bite.

11:54.368 --> 11:56.322
Those chicken wings were out of this world.

11:56.481 --> 11:59.013
Yeah. And how about the pasta?

12:06.529 --> 12:09.540
I gotta tell you, Race,
that pasta was incredible.

12:09.697 --> 12:11.716
Where'd you get the recipe?

12:12.737 --> 12:14.920
Just a spicy little dish...

12:15.073 --> 12:19.241
...that another spicy little dish taught me
a long time ago.

12:19.393 --> 12:21.030
Mm-hm.

12:21.185 --> 12:24.874
- Was she sweet too?
- Uh, yeah, she was, uh...

12:25.025 --> 12:27.906
I mean... I mean, the dish was...
I... Well, you know how women are.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.799
Uh, tiramisu, anyone?

12:29.953 --> 12:32.299
I think we should all... Ahem... turn in.

12:32.673 --> 12:34.473
Whew. I owe you one, doc.

12:34.625 --> 12:39.012
That's quite all right, Race.
You've saved me many times.

12:39.169 --> 12:40.969
Well, how about it, team?

12:41.121 --> 12:43.467
Time for some shut-eye?

12:47.681 --> 12:50.791
Yeah. And Tom and Jerry can bunk with us.

12:56.768 --> 12:58.601
Off to bed, everyone.

13:11.872 --> 13:14.153
Let's go, Tom.

13:58.849 --> 14:01.675
Yeah, how we gonna get inside?
Many lasers. Lasers are very dangerous.

14:01.825 --> 14:03.778
Prone to accidents, burn our tails. Yeah.

14:03.937 --> 14:06.796
We're gonna have to find a way
to shut off the security system.

14:21.665 --> 14:24.578
Just like that.

15:31.776 --> 15:34.209
Thanks for leaving the door open, boys.

15:36.384 --> 15:38.632
- You really shouldn't have.
- Whoa-ho-ho.

15:38.785 --> 15:40.804
Is that chicken paprikash?

15:40.961 --> 15:43.110
- Ow!
- Focus, doofus.

15:43.264 --> 15:47.367
We're here to steal that sphere
and grab Dr. Quest.

16:09.345 --> 16:11.876
Stop him! That mouse will ruin everything.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.117
Ah! Very fast mouse.

16:15.329 --> 16:17.031
Yeah, missed me.

16:18.497 --> 16:19.653
Hit me, but didn't hurt.

16:24.929 --> 16:27.940
Ah! Got a whole new look. Kitty Santa.
Definitely Santa.

16:37.312 --> 16:38.469
Nice, kitty.

16:49.313 --> 16:50.601
Oh, yeah, there it is.

16:50.752 --> 16:52.771
Of course, definitely the Q Sphere.

16:59.456 --> 17:00.875
Uh-oh. Robot arm!

17:09.537 --> 17:11.141
Definitely free!

17:16.031 --> 17:17.156
Got it.

17:19.551 --> 17:22.280
Yeah, that's right, mousey.
This ball game's over.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.720
Whoa!

17:23.873 --> 17:25.258
Oh! Ow.

17:31.361 --> 17:33.609
Definitely rolling. Agh!

17:39.872 --> 17:41.029
Got it.

18:09.824 --> 18:12.999
Uh, perhaps we should use the back door.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.675
It's the creeps from the beach.

18:24.832 --> 18:26.731
They're stealing the Q Sphere.

18:26.881 --> 18:29.314
Put it down, nice and easy.

18:31.968 --> 18:33.027
What?

18:40.960 --> 18:43.665
Stand back, doctor. I've got him.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.354
Huh?

18:47.297 --> 18:48.966
Oh, no.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.264
Ooh. I'll take that.

19:01.824 --> 19:03.429
What's all the commotion?

19:07.776 --> 19:10.176
- Dad!
- Stay back, boys!

19:15.776 --> 19:17.893
Hang on, doctor!

19:19.776 --> 19:22.657
Not so fast, bucket head.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.849
Turn this bus around. Hey!

19:30.528 --> 19:32.711
Bye-bye, boys.

19:36.224 --> 19:38.373
Holy smoke! They got Dad and Race.

19:38.528 --> 19:41.856
But why did the security system not alert us?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.593
I understand why evil people
would take the Q Sphere...

19:50.752 --> 19:52.672
...but why take Dr. Quest?

19:52.833 --> 19:56.193
Because Dad is the only man on the planet
who knows how to work it.

19:56.352 --> 19:59.047
With Race out of the picture,
who will save Dr. Quest?

19:59.201 --> 20:01.928
We can save them.
If we only knew where they went.

20:02.081 --> 20:05.736
Perhaps those robot creatures
left some sort of energy trail.

20:05.888 --> 20:07.721
I doubt it.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.353
But the Q Sphere does.

20:09.505 --> 20:10.945
Good thinking, Hadji.

20:11.104 --> 20:14.377
I find meditation helps clear the mind.

20:21.504 --> 20:25.923
There! Somewhere in the tiny nation
of Moldovistan.

20:27.649 --> 20:29.994
All right, Quesketeers, to the Quest Jet!

20:30.144 --> 20:31.944
But, Jonny, who is going to pilot?

20:32.097 --> 20:34.396
I am, I guess.

20:48.608 --> 20:49.896
All right, buckle up.

21:45.504 --> 21:46.694
Great takeoff, Jonny.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.965
I've seen Race do it a hundred times.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.237
Landing, not so much.

21:53.824 --> 21:56.039
I see that you've secured the prisoners.

21:57.696 --> 21:58.984
Safe and sound.

21:59.136 --> 22:01.035
Yup, we locked them up good.

22:01.184 --> 22:04.676
Yes, but I'm afraid Dr. Quest
still refuses to cooperate.

22:04.832 --> 22:06.370
Ah! The fool!

22:06.529 --> 22:08.711
Yeah, I don't think he likes you.
Definitely not a fan.

22:08.864 --> 22:11.396
Not wearing your T-shirt.
Definitely no T-shirt.

22:12.416 --> 22:17.795
Perhaps we can find a way to motivate him.

22:28.352 --> 22:31.299
Yeah, definitely went on too long.
Got to know when to quit.

22:34.752 --> 22:36.193
How close are we, Hadji?

22:36.352 --> 22:38.119
We're just off the coast of Moldovistan.

22:38.272 --> 22:40.455
The signal is coming from one of the islands.

23:00.224 --> 23:01.512
We have company, Jonny.

23:01.664 --> 23:03.082
Robot drone missiles.

23:03.232 --> 23:04.388
I'll shake them off.

23:04.544 --> 23:05.700
Done it a million times.

23:05.856 --> 23:06.848
You have?

23:07.008 --> 23:08.427
In the Quest simulator.

23:08.576 --> 23:10.660
- Simulator?
- Hold tight!

23:19.872 --> 23:22.534
Hadji, get ready to hit the thrusters.

23:26.048 --> 23:27.881
A little farther.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.313
I am not certain there is any farther left.

23:30.464 --> 23:31.817
- Jonny.
- <i>Warning.</i>

23:32.160 --> 23:33.863
- <i>Warming. Collision imminent.</i>
- Come on.

23:34.016 --> 23:35.783
- Come on.
- <i>Impact unavoidable.</i>

23:35.936 --> 23:37.922
- Now!
- Ungh!

23:40.352 --> 23:43.015
Pull up, Jonny! Pull up! Pull up!

23:46.208 --> 23:48.162
<i>Collision avoided.</i>

23:55.552 --> 23:57.157
Phew.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.163
I don't like the sound of that.

24:19.776 --> 24:20.900
Hang on, guys!

24:26.272 --> 24:27.527
Abandon ship?

24:27.680 --> 24:28.739
Good idea.

25:05.728 --> 25:07.016
Hang on, guys!

25:13.920 --> 25:15.655
Gotcha.

25:17.024 --> 25:18.529
Not so tight, Tom.

25:19.136 --> 25:20.457
I can't reach the rip cord.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.660
Race is gonna go through the roof.

25:35.392 --> 25:38.753
Look on the bright side,
now you do not have to land it.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.237
Where are we?

25:43.392 --> 25:45.259
Hey, there's the answer.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.437
Oh. Moldovistan. We actually made it.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.676
Let's head for the city.

26:02.144 --> 26:06.050
My, my, my. So it was Jonny Quest
who was flying the jet.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.910
Clever boy.

26:08.064 --> 26:10.857
No doubt he was aided
by that magnificent cat.

26:11.008 --> 26:14.281
Look how he is ready for danger
at every turn.

26:14.624 --> 26:15.813
He ain't so tough.

26:15.968 --> 26:17.157
What was that?

26:17.312 --> 26:19.811
Nothing, boss. Uh, doc. Doctor.

26:19.968 --> 26:21.638
Dr. Zin, sir.

26:35.968 --> 26:37.625
Bandit.

26:38.816 --> 26:40.235
Here, boy.

26:44.383 --> 26:46.915
The tracker says the Q Sphere
is still on the island.

26:49.792 --> 26:52.170
How do we get there? We have no money.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.462
Don't worry.
We have an old friend who lives here.

26:57.088 --> 27:00.842
Yes, Dr. Zin. Understood.

27:07.872 --> 27:11.659
We must bring the boys to Zin alive.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.382
And the animals?

27:13.535 --> 27:16.394
Ah, they are expendable.

27:26.784 --> 27:29.413
But be careful of that cat.

27:29.568 --> 27:32.776
He's diabolically clever.

27:33.312 --> 27:35.178
Hey, quit horsing around.

27:35.328 --> 27:37.576
- Which way, Jonny?
- I don't know.

27:37.728 --> 27:40.861
Last time I was here, I was just a kid.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.866
Jonny, look out!

28:17.280 --> 28:18.633
Watch out, Hadji.

28:31.807 --> 28:34.819
Ha-ha. The noose tightens.

28:40.256 --> 28:41.576
Come on!

28:41.728 --> 28:43.168
Get off me! Agh!

28:48.575 --> 28:50.310
Wrong way.

28:52.704 --> 28:54.826
I have an idea.

28:59.168 --> 29:02.790
Everybody up.
Time to make like a banana and split.

29:02.944 --> 29:04.417
Stop them!

29:08.000 --> 29:09.091
Follow them!

29:09.247 --> 29:10.601
Whoa!

29:13.087 --> 29:15.914
I am truly sorry for this.

29:20.672 --> 29:22.952
Ungh. It's locked.

29:23.903 --> 29:25.377
Hurry, you fools!

29:25.536 --> 29:28.068
Jonny, we do not have much time.

29:38.303 --> 29:40.901
My, my, looked what the cat dragged in.

29:41.056 --> 29:43.588
- Jezebel Jade?
- Just the person we've been looking for.

29:43.744 --> 29:47.465
But, Jonny, is she not a mercenary
who works for the highest bidder?

29:47.616 --> 29:49.515
Let's debate morality later, boys.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.715
Inside. Now.

29:57.632 --> 29:59.236
Better get downstairs.

29:59.392 --> 30:00.516
You too, Mopsy.

30:07.103 --> 30:08.708
Where does this door lead?

30:08.863 --> 30:10.598
I think to there.

30:28.032 --> 30:29.898
Eyes this way, boys.

30:30.048 --> 30:31.521
Nice place, Miss Jade.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.113
Yes, very artistic.

30:35.551 --> 30:37.897
It ain't Carnegie Hall, but it's paid for.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.706
We sure are glad to see you, Miss Jade.

30:41.855 --> 30:43.077
Cut to the chase, kiddo.

30:46.815 --> 30:48.201
We really need your help.

30:48.352 --> 30:52.040
Race and my Dad have been captured
and we're here to rescue them.

30:52.192 --> 30:55.073
Well, I hope you like foster care, kid,
because Dr. Zin has them.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.274
Dr. Zin? How...? How do you know?

30:58.431 --> 31:00.777
You forget, information is my business.

31:01.119 --> 31:03.236
Dr. Zin has been after my dad's research.

31:03.391 --> 31:04.832
You have got to help us.

31:04.992 --> 31:06.629
Sure, make me an offer.

31:06.784 --> 31:10.144
I don't see any collateral,
so I'll settle for cash.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.857
But this could endanger the world.

31:14.016 --> 31:17.824
Jezebel Jade sticks her neck out for no one.

31:17.983 --> 31:19.172
Even Race?

31:20.448 --> 31:22.281
Especially Race.

31:23.647 --> 31:25.735
I thought you liked him.

31:27.872 --> 31:32.673
Um, we had a little something once.
But apparently once was enough for him.

31:34.176 --> 31:37.220
Now, if you'll excuse me, boys,
I've got a show to do.

31:47.903 --> 31:51.559
Too bad, Miss Jade.
Could've been a pretty sweet deal for you.

31:51.712 --> 31:52.836
Right, Hadji?

31:53.344 --> 31:55.908
Oh, uh, yes. Very sweet. Like honey.

31:56.672 --> 31:58.505
Deal? What deal?

31:58.655 --> 32:01.416
Dad was working on a top-secret project
for the government.

32:01.568 --> 32:03.368
I bet they'd pay plenty to get it back.

32:03.519 --> 32:05.865
But if you'd rather pass on a fat reward...

32:10.560 --> 32:14.662
On second thought, boys,
you may have touched my heart after all.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.998
Jezebel Jade is open for business.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.030
There's a skimmer down in the garage.

32:37.184 --> 32:39.300
That should get you to the island.

32:39.456 --> 32:42.314
- Thanks, Miss Jade.
- Whoa, hold your horses.

32:42.463 --> 32:44.580
This isn't free. Sign here.

32:44.735 --> 32:49.187
I expect your father or the government
to pay me for the rental of my equipment...

32:49.343 --> 32:50.762
...in case of your demise.

32:50.911 --> 32:53.377
You drive a hard bargain, Miss Jade.

32:53.535 --> 32:56.514
But Race always said
you were the smartest lady he knew.

32:56.671 --> 32:58.697
He called me a lady?

32:59.168 --> 33:02.528
Five minutes, Miss Jade. Break a leg.

33:02.687 --> 33:04.422
You can leave from downstairs.

33:04.576 --> 33:06.016
Just don't make a racket.

33:06.975 --> 33:08.580
Come on.

33:11.679 --> 33:12.672
There it is.

33:12.831 --> 33:14.599
I will open the door.

33:15.967 --> 33:18.629
- There they are!
- Uh-oh. We gotta move.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.224
Don't let them get away!

33:24.384 --> 33:26.435
- They're getting away!
- Grab ahold.

33:27.583 --> 33:28.609
Look out!

33:38.784 --> 33:42.406
<i>In the heart of the city</i>

33:42.559 --> 33:45.833
<i>Dwells the lady who's known as Jade</i>

33:46.431 --> 33:49.639
<i>Powerful, bold and pretty</i>

33:49.792 --> 33:52.770
<i>She's a girl who's got it made</i>

33:53.984 --> 33:57.672
<i>Oh, I don't need no man</i>

33:57.824 --> 34:01.697
<i>Independent and full of pride</i>

34:01.855 --> 34:04.769
<i>I'm a gal with a plan</i>

34:04.927 --> 34:07.306
<i>It don't include being</i>

34:08.032 --> 34:10.629
<i>Some man's bride</i>

34:20.255 --> 34:23.496
<i>I'm all business, no pleasure</i>

34:24.031 --> 34:27.719
<i>And I know what men desire</i>

34:27.871 --> 34:30.534
<i>For they seek pomp and treasure</i>

34:31.136 --> 34:33.089
<i>The highest bidder</i>

34:34.464 --> 34:37.768
<i>Is the buyer</i>

34:37.918 --> 34:42.982
<i>Oh, I don't heed, heed no man</i>

34:45.663 --> 34:50.431
<i>Oh, I don't need, need no man</i>

34:53.472 --> 34:57.258
<i>But, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man</i>

35:01.248 --> 35:06.660
<i>Oh, man, oh, man, do I need you</i>

35:06.815 --> 35:09.215
<i>Do I need you</i>

35:12.031 --> 35:15.785
<i>Mercenary species</i>

35:15.935 --> 35:19.591
<i>But my heart is not for sale</i>

35:19.744 --> 35:23.301
<i>Hardened, broken in pieces</i>

35:23.455 --> 35:27.428
<i>Thank a tall, tan action male</i>

35:27.583 --> 35:30.529
<i>In the heart of the city</i>

35:31.231 --> 35:34.920
<i>Dwells the lady who's known as Jade</i>

35:35.071 --> 35:38.344
<i>Lonely, loveless, a pity</i>

35:38.495 --> 35:43.460
<i>I'm the girl that love betrayed</i>

35:46.495 --> 35:48.776
<i>Man, oh, man, oh, man</i>

35:48.927 --> 35:51.754
<i>Do I need you</i>

35:53.919 --> 35:56.778
<i>Man, oh, man, oh, man</i>

35:58.623 --> 36:01.024
<i>Do I need you</i>

36:02.848 --> 36:04.004
Whoa!

36:13.088 --> 36:14.441
- Great show.
- Wonderful.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.675
Wonderful. Bravo!

36:16.832 --> 36:18.370
Yay!

36:18.527 --> 36:21.954
Marvelous. Absolutely marvelous.

36:22.111 --> 36:23.911
Add the damage to their tab.

36:24.064 --> 36:25.537
Yes, Miss Jade.

36:30.399 --> 36:33.313
Dr. Zin's island is dead ahead.

36:43.231 --> 36:44.552
Shake a leg, guys.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.717
Come on, Quesketeers.
There's no time to fool around.

36:55.871 --> 36:58.272
Okay, boy, down you go. You okay?

36:59.519 --> 37:01.090
I think he likes it.

37:01.248 --> 37:04.521
We'll fly halfway up the volcano
to get a better look at the island.

37:13.055 --> 37:14.855
Okay, let's go.

37:40.352 --> 37:42.752
So you think Zin noticed?

37:43.615 --> 37:45.764
Highly likely.

37:50.623 --> 37:51.779
Dinner is served.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.655
Oh! Fish sticks again?

37:56.191 --> 38:00.545
This is the third time this week.
I hate fish sticks!

38:00.928 --> 38:02.794
Aw, Dr. Quest.

38:02.944 --> 38:04.362
I told you, Zin...

38:04.512 --> 38:07.393
...I'll never help you access the power
of the Q Sphere.

38:07.551 --> 38:11.556
Trust me. Heh-heh.
I have ways to convince you.

38:11.711 --> 38:13.184
Hey.

38:13.343 --> 38:15.263
- Dad!
- Dr. Quest.

38:15.424 --> 38:17.955
Jonny. Hadji. How did you get here?

38:18.111 --> 38:22.857
Aw. Such an affectionate display
of family devotion.

38:23.008 --> 38:25.507
Oh, boy, it would warm my heart...

38:25.663 --> 38:26.755
...if I had one.

38:26.911 --> 38:29.257
What do you want, Zin?

38:31.231 --> 38:33.151
All you have to do, Dr. Quest...

38:33.312 --> 38:36.672
...is to wire the sphere
to the island's energy system.

38:36.831 --> 38:42.178
Now, once that is completed,
I'll return the boys to you safe and sound.

38:42.335 --> 38:45.608
But try any trickery,
and I'll deliver them to you...

38:45.759 --> 38:49.819
...a little bit on the crispy side.

38:54.432 --> 38:55.720
Don't do it, Dad.

38:55.871 --> 38:57.541
I have no choice, Jonny.

38:57.695 --> 39:00.522
I can't let any harm come to you and Hadji.

39:18.463 --> 39:19.751
Take the boys to their cell.

39:19.903 --> 39:21.703
And make sure you find that cat.

39:21.855 --> 39:25.958
Nothing is safe around here
until that devious feline is dispatched.

39:26.112 --> 39:30.531
I want him shot on sight. Bang.

40:29.472 --> 40:32.799
I have to admit,
I'm amazed you boys got this far.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.149
But I wish you hadn't.

40:35.647 --> 40:39.106
Titanium steel.
Believe me, I've tried to bend it.

40:39.263 --> 40:41.893
I just hope this floor does not crack.

40:42.271 --> 40:43.559
So much for digging a tunnel.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.795
Hey, what about up there?

40:45.951 --> 40:47.205
That's just a ventilator.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.925
Even if we could reach it,
it's too small to fit through.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.716
Bandit! You're just about the right size.

40:55.871 --> 40:59.079
Hadji, you think you can still do
your levitation trick?

40:59.231 --> 41:01.348
It is no trick, Sahib Race.

41:01.887 --> 41:04.746
<i>Sim Sim Salabim!</i>

41:16.543 --> 41:17.700
Good boy.

41:17.855 --> 41:19.328
Now go find Tom and Jerry.

41:46.303 --> 41:48.933
<i>Oh, oh. Is this on? We're live?</i>

41:49.087 --> 41:50.560
<i>You could have said something.</i>

41:50.719 --> 41:54.025
<i>Welcome to the Zin Automated Battle Island.</i>

41:54.175 --> 41:55.331
<i>Hello, hello out there.</i>

41:55.487 --> 41:57.865
<i>Thanks to space age technology...</i>

41:58.015 --> 41:59.848
<i>...this mobile fortress of destruction...</i>

41:59.999 --> 42:04.484
<i>...is powerful enough to bring any country
of your own choosing, heh...</i>

42:04.639 --> 42:07.814
<i>...to its knees. Heh.</i>

42:07.967 --> 42:10.848
<i>And all for a reasonable price.</i>

42:23.071 --> 42:25.536
So it was Jade who got you here?

42:27.999 --> 42:29.156
She helped.

42:31.775 --> 42:34.853
Did, uh, she mention me by any chance?

42:37.119 --> 42:38.624
Oh, yeah.

42:39.647 --> 42:41.087
That bad, huh?

42:41.247 --> 42:45.699
I think she still likes you, Race,
in a scary kind of way.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.076
I can't blame her.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.584
It's what happens, boys...

42:48.735 --> 42:51.713
...when you put business
in front of other people's feelings.

42:51.871 --> 42:54.533
I guess I messed things up big-time.

42:55.391 --> 42:57.191
I know the feeling.

42:57.343 --> 42:59.492
Sorry I got you into this, Hadji.

42:59.647 --> 43:03.881
If I had it to do all over again,
I would still be here.

43:04.031 --> 43:08.483
Thanks, but like my dad says,
sometimes I bite off more than I can chew.

43:08.639 --> 43:10.439
Don't beat yourself up, Jonny.

43:10.591 --> 43:11.683
You too, Hadji.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.305
- I'm proud of you both.
- Yeah?

43:14.463 --> 43:15.936
Absolutely.

43:16.095 --> 43:19.456
What other boys would have had
the courage and resourcefulness...

43:19.615 --> 43:21.481
...to travel across continents...

43:21.631 --> 43:24.741
...to track us down
in the middle of a volcano?

43:24.895 --> 43:27.274
Gee, thanks, Race.

43:30.143 --> 43:32.904
As a matter of fact,
when we get back to the Keys...

43:33.055 --> 43:36.066
...how about some flying lessons in the jet?

43:36.511 --> 43:38.857
Yeah, the jet.

43:43.263 --> 43:47.333
I hope you're not considering
any delaying "tactics," Dr. Quest.

43:49.311 --> 43:53.795
On the contrary, Zin,
the Q Sphere is now fully installed.

43:53.951 --> 43:55.141
At last.

43:55.295 --> 43:56.354
Bring him up.

44:01.023 --> 44:02.726
May I see my son now?

44:02.879 --> 44:05.378
First, we must test the sphere.

44:05.535 --> 44:10.183
Because if it doesn't work,
you'll be seeing your son in the crab pit.

44:30.847 --> 44:34.152
Fish sticks ain't good enough for you?
No, of course not. No, no, no.

44:34.303 --> 44:36.103
You're a big-time doctor.

44:36.255 --> 44:38.437
Yeah. Well, a doctor of what, eh? Huh!

44:41.119 --> 44:44.229
Hey, ain't you supposed to be upstairs?

44:44.382 --> 44:48.289
Then you can take this up
to his royal butthead.

44:50.398 --> 44:52.930
And stay out of the catnip.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.426
Can you feel it, Dr. Quest?

45:31.583 --> 45:34.943
It's the power of my intellect
being unleashed.

45:35.103 --> 45:38.792
That's funny, it sounds like my Q Sphere.

45:39.102 --> 45:42.408
Isn't that just like you, Benton?

45:42.559 --> 45:44.130
Denying my brilliance.

45:44.607 --> 45:46.823
Even when we were freshmen
at the university...

45:46.975 --> 45:49.223
...you were jealous of my superior genius.

45:49.566 --> 45:52.545
All you had was a genius for destruction.

45:52.703 --> 45:55.464
Agh! I did not burn down the chemistry lab!

45:56.063 --> 45:58.409
It was never proven.

45:58.687 --> 46:01.414
What about the explosion
at the super collider?

46:01.567 --> 46:03.945
A little cloud of radiation.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.561
I don't know why they got so huffy about it.

46:06.719 --> 46:08.770
I was the one who lost his hair!

46:08.927 --> 46:14.688
My long, beautiful, silky hair
with its natural bounciness.

46:17.087 --> 46:20.098
They had to evacuate the city, Zin.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.911
It really is too bad, Dr. Quest.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.570
We could have been quite a team, you and I.

46:25.727 --> 46:27.713
We could have ruled the world!

46:27.871 --> 46:30.981
Instead, that glory will be all mine.
Ha-ha-ha!

46:31.135 --> 46:35.402
You might have saved us all the trouble
by inventing a decent hair restorer.

46:37.535 --> 46:38.975
Grr. <i>Gweilo.</i>

46:58.430 --> 46:59.751
What's happening, Race?

46:59.902 --> 47:03.329
Looks like Zin's plan
is gonna bring the roof down on us.

47:03.871 --> 47:06.119
I'm more worried about the floor.

47:06.270 --> 47:07.776
Up here, boys.

47:14.079 --> 47:15.432
Ugh. Crabs.

47:15.870 --> 47:18.020
Ugh. Always hated crabs.

47:19.583 --> 47:21.023
Help!

47:22.590 --> 47:24.645
Not on my watch.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.532
Bandit!

47:26.911 --> 47:28.449
And he brought Tom and Jerry.

47:28.607 --> 47:30.625
Can they get us out of here?

47:37.151 --> 47:40.097
If you're gonna rescue us,
now would be a good time.

47:47.711 --> 47:49.729
- We're waiting.
- Agh!

47:54.783 --> 47:55.972
Now!

48:01.631 --> 48:03.551
Well done, guys.

48:04.062 --> 48:05.568
- Tom. Jonny.
- Ungh!

48:05.727 --> 48:07.080
Watch out.

48:15.775 --> 48:16.932
Bandit!

48:19.167 --> 48:20.640
Let's go.

48:30.719 --> 48:31.875
Whew.

48:42.335 --> 48:45.412
Behold, Dr. Quest, my triumph is at hand.

49:28.383 --> 49:29.823
Incredible.

49:55.455 --> 49:57.703
Race, we're headed for the edge!

49:57.854 --> 50:00.037
Hang on, boys!

50:00.190 --> 50:01.696
I can't stop!

50:02.431 --> 50:04.515
- Oh, no! Hadji!
- Agh!

50:04.670 --> 50:06.111
- Race!
- Gotcha.

50:07.710 --> 50:08.932
Hadji.

50:09.087 --> 50:11.007
- And I've got you.
- That was close.

50:15.230 --> 50:17.718
Couldn't forget about you.

50:19.007 --> 50:20.807
Tom. Ungh!

50:22.110 --> 50:23.551
Gotcha. Whoa!

50:29.374 --> 50:30.880
Oh, no.

50:32.735 --> 50:34.601
You're... You're slipping.

50:35.071 --> 50:37.417
- Agh!
- No!

51:01.470 --> 51:02.692
Not again.

51:14.206 --> 51:16.738
- Where exactly are you taking us, Zin?
- Ha-ha-ha.

51:16.894 --> 51:18.313
Home, Dr. Quest.

51:18.463 --> 51:21.060
While you were tinkering
with your little sphere...

51:21.214 --> 51:23.975
...I devised a means to harness its energy...

51:24.127 --> 51:27.749
...to create the greatest,
most glorious warship...

51:27.902 --> 51:30.630
...the world has ever seen.

51:40.126 --> 51:41.796
Watch out. Drone ahead.

51:43.262 --> 51:44.517
I'll need a distraction.

51:44.670 --> 51:49.187
Hmm. Tom can do it. Well, in that suit,
he'll think you're one of Zin's cats.

52:05.215 --> 52:06.819
No!

52:26.110 --> 52:27.715
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

52:27.870 --> 52:29.856
Your worst shutdown.

52:32.287 --> 52:34.502
Talk about an instant junkyard.

52:39.007 --> 52:40.839
When did we get this communiqué?

52:40.991 --> 52:44.864
Just moments ago, Mr. President.
It went to all the world's leaders.

52:45.023 --> 52:46.528
You're sure it's from Zin?

52:46.687 --> 52:47.908
Yes, sir.

52:48.063 --> 52:51.489
That's his signature smiley face
at the end of the threat.

52:55.166 --> 52:56.552
Can we stop him?

52:56.703 --> 52:58.656
We're trying to locate him now...

52:58.815 --> 53:01.641
...but apparently his airship
has been cloaked from radar.

53:02.303 --> 53:05.184
Perhaps we should bring in Dr. Benton Quest.

53:05.343 --> 53:08.038
We would if we could find him.

53:19.647 --> 53:21.666
Fifteen minutes, Dr. Quest.

53:21.822 --> 53:26.903
The time it takes to cook a frozen pizza
is all the time your nation has left.

53:38.366 --> 53:41.542
You guys stay back.
I'm gonna get your father.

53:49.630 --> 53:52.071
Upsa-daisy.

53:54.430 --> 53:56.743
Hadji, we have to shut down the Q Sphere.

54:03.551 --> 54:04.839
Can you handle the crane?

54:09.790 --> 54:12.355
Yes, I am quite good at lifting things.

54:26.622 --> 54:28.838
Ready when you are, Jonny.

54:29.215 --> 54:30.655
Ready.

54:31.006 --> 54:32.774
Ready as I'll ever be.

54:34.623 --> 54:36.838
You guys stand guard, okay?

54:43.230 --> 54:44.452
Looking good, Jonny.

54:48.734 --> 54:50.949
You're almost there.

54:58.494 --> 55:01.637
Nothing goes better
with a military bombardment...

55:01.982 --> 55:05.474
...than a hot cup of chai tea.

55:05.982 --> 55:07.587
Ew!

55:07.742 --> 55:10.055
Milk? Huh?

55:13.023 --> 55:14.660
What? Race Bannon?

55:30.750 --> 55:33.315
Ah! And the cat?

55:33.470 --> 55:34.725
Leave Bannon to the drones.

55:34.878 --> 55:38.664
You must protect the sphere
from that hateful cat.

55:52.383 --> 55:55.809
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah. Here we come. Uh-oh!

56:17.662 --> 56:19.910
Huh? Oh. Grr.

56:20.062 --> 56:21.186
What?

56:21.342 --> 56:23.393
Hey, it's that Quest kid.

56:23.550 --> 56:27.304
You guys get the cat
and I'll take care of the brat.

56:39.679 --> 56:40.835
Whoa!

56:44.990 --> 56:46.594
Uh, Hadji.

56:46.751 --> 56:48.039
I am on it.

56:58.879 --> 57:00.035
Whoa.

57:01.630 --> 57:04.031
Boys, I need a little help down here.

57:04.190 --> 57:06.339
You got it. Help is on the way.

57:06.494 --> 57:09.222
Yeah, yeah, help on the way.
We're the help. Ha-ha.

57:38.526 --> 57:40.229
Whoa!

57:48.510 --> 57:50.114
You're going the wrong way.

57:57.470 --> 57:59.456
Where you going, buddy boy?

58:04.894 --> 58:07.426
He really was nothing but a scaredy-cat.

58:07.582 --> 58:09.055
Yeah, a real coward.

58:09.214 --> 58:11.647
Definitely yellow.
Yellow like a dandelion, yeah.

58:11.806 --> 58:15.396
One down, four to go. Ha-ha-ha.

58:21.694 --> 58:23.560
Jerry. Ungh!

58:24.958 --> 58:26.279
Gotcha.

58:31.038 --> 58:32.512
Whoa.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.846
Five minutes, Dr. Quest.

58:35.006 --> 58:38.694
I can almost taste the pepperoni
and mushrooms. Yum, yum, yum.

58:39.166 --> 58:42.626
You're one sick, twisted individual, Zin.

58:48.574 --> 58:49.959
Whew.

58:54.110 --> 58:55.648
There. Just a couple more.

58:56.062 --> 58:57.251
Oh, yeah? Ha-ha.

58:57.406 --> 59:00.352
You think so, huh? Well, how about
we blow your crane down, huh?

59:00.510 --> 59:01.950
Bandit, no.

59:07.038 --> 59:08.326
No!

59:08.478 --> 59:10.694
Aw. Gee, too bad, kid.

59:12.702 --> 59:14.088
<i>Watch out, Hadji!</i>

59:14.238 --> 59:20.131
<i>Well, this is one way to kill two birds
with one stone, huh? Ha-ha-ha.</i>

59:23.198 --> 59:24.387
Jonny, look out!

59:29.694 --> 59:31.135
- Yeah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

59:32.894 --> 59:34.334
Hold on, Jerry.

59:45.246 --> 59:47.559
Oh. Nice flying, Tom.

59:47.902 --> 59:49.342
You take the kid...

59:49.502 --> 59:51.008
...I get the dog.

59:51.358 --> 59:52.896
Huh?

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.295
Well, well.

01:00:04.446 --> 01:00:09.575
This little reunion will make it easier
to take care of you all in one fell swoop.

01:00:14.302 --> 01:00:16.518
Cut them down to size, boys.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.746
Definitely one of the boys,
one of the gang. Yeah.

01:00:21.662 --> 01:00:25.983
You should have quit
while you were ahead, kitty cat.

01:00:40.798 --> 01:00:43.492
Yeah. Cut it down to size.

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:16.870
Come on, Hadji, now is our chance.

01:01:27.678 --> 01:01:28.999
Whoa.

01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:32.772
Whoa!

01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:34.596
Jump!

01:01:45.725 --> 01:01:46.915
What now?

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:05.822
No!

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.750
You have bested me, feline.

01:02:28.413 --> 01:02:30.116
- Dad.
- Dr. Quest.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.492
Jonny. Hadji.

01:02:31.646 --> 01:02:35.203
Your magnificent cat
may have won this battle...

01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:38.184
...but even without the sphere,
this island has enough energy...

01:02:38.334 --> 01:02:40.101
...to reach the coast and crash.

01:02:40.254 --> 01:02:42.599
Happy landing, Dr. Quest.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:52.128
- What?
- Car's full, doc. Try the next one.

01:02:52.286 --> 01:02:54.981
Hey! That's my escape pod! Not yours.

01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:56.739
Wait!

01:02:58.173 --> 01:03:03.106
Why did I ever make henchmen out of cats?

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:09.861
We've located Zin's airship, Mr. President.

01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:12.840
But I'm afraid it's too late. He's too close.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:17.471
Aw. Then it's going to take a miracle
to save this city.

01:03:23.518 --> 01:03:25.701
Dad, Tom and Jerry know where the skimmer is.

01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:27.971
We can use that to escape.

01:03:28.126 --> 01:03:31.814
Good thinking. But we can't take a chance
on this island hitting the capital.

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:32.926
What are you doing?

01:03:33.086 --> 01:03:35.334
I knew someday I might fall into enemy hands.

01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:38.213
So I created a fail-safe missile
that homes in on my watch...

01:03:38.366 --> 01:03:40.712
...to prevent my work
from being used for evil.

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:43.551
It's activated. Let's get out of here.

01:03:43.709 --> 01:03:47.682
And on top of that, the Washington Monument
has 900 steps, a 2-ton capstone...

01:03:47.838 --> 01:03:49.704
...30,000 marble blocks... Agh!

01:03:49.854 --> 01:03:52.582
...and Titan III rocket boosters.

01:04:00.158 --> 01:04:02.341
Shouldn't I have known about that?

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:19.236
- We're cut off.
- Maybe there's a way we can go around.

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:20.743
We don't have time.

01:04:20.893 --> 01:04:24.680
I will levitate Jerry to the other side
and he can bring the skimmer to us.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.394
I'm sorry, boys. I'm afraid this is it.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.259
- Never send a mouse to do a man's job.
- Huh?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.052
Or a woman's.

01:05:02.206 --> 01:05:04.126
Miss Jade. But how?

01:05:04.286 --> 01:05:06.403
I followed you.
I had to protect my investment.

01:05:06.558 --> 01:05:08.512
We even saved your little ball.

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:13.892
Jump, Race!

01:05:16.798 --> 01:05:19.460
Jezebel, you're a sight for sore eyes.

01:05:19.613 --> 01:05:21.697
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:05:21.854 --> 01:05:24.254
- Uh, can we go now?
- We'd better.

01:05:50.462 --> 01:05:53.540
And as we reconstruct
the Washington Monument...

01:05:53.694 --> 01:05:57.186
...with the original stones
we retrieved from the ocean...

01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:01.509
...we are proud to honor
these brave and ingenious heroes...

01:06:01.662 --> 01:06:06.856
...with the Distinguished Medal
for Bravery and Ingenuity.

01:06:08.061 --> 01:06:10.728
Bravo. Bravo.

01:06:12.765 --> 01:06:14.370
Cool. Uh...

01:06:14.525 --> 01:06:15.911
I mean, thanks, Mr. President.

01:06:16.062 --> 01:06:20.067
You know, Jonny,
you remind me of myself at your age.

01:06:22.686 --> 01:06:25.413
Whoa. Easy, boy.

01:06:26.526 --> 01:06:30.531
Oh, and we even had a special one
made for you, Mr. Mouse.

01:07:08.605 --> 01:07:11.137
I don't remember this in the program.
