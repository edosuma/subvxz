00:02.263 --> 00:03.481
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:03.525 --> 00:04.569
-Mom.
What brought you here?

00:04.613 --> 00:06.919
Reign.
She's terrorizing Earth.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.921
I think we found something
that could stop her,

00:08.965 --> 00:10.097
and we followed it here.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.099
Harun-El.
The Black Rock of Yuda Kal.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.971
Keeps our air breathable
and shields us from invaders.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.277
We will give you
what you seek.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.847
In the darkness
of Rao's absence,

00:21.891 --> 00:23.023
I call upon you...

00:23.545 --> 00:24.850
Worldkiller.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.812
Lena, we're here.

00:29.855 --> 00:30.856
Did you get the Rock?

00:31.466 --> 00:32.467
Just in time.

00:40.910 --> 00:41.911
We'll keep her busy.

02:06.909 --> 02:07.910
Sam?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.260
Can you hear me?

02:10.956 --> 02:12.349
I need a...

02:14.786 --> 02:16.353
Do you have some aspirin?

02:35.720 --> 02:36.808
How do you feel?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.378
It's a cliche, but I feel
like I got hit by a bus.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.120
Sorry.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.561
Mom?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.259
Ruby.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.619
Oh, look at your hair.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.796
-Yes. I love it.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.059
I love you.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.631
Thank you.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.509
You really went to great
lengths to save Sam
and her family.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.729
Well, you are the one
that went to outer space.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.426
I have to ask you something.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.255
You were able
to synthesize Kryptonite.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.214
Can you make more
of the Black Rock?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.041
Possibly. Why?

03:36.433 --> 03:38.000
It's called Harun-El.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.176
The meteoroid we found it on
is inhabited.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.310
It's a precious resource
there, but they sacrificed
some to help us.

03:44.398 --> 03:47.009
-I'll get to work
on it immediately.
-Thank you.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.144
Well, you did it.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.146
I have to tell you something.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.194
Your mom is alive?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.850
It doesn't feel real.

04:02.807 --> 04:03.808
But it is.

04:04.287 --> 04:07.116
I saw her,
I listened to her voice,

04:07.159 --> 04:09.336
I touched her, I hugged her.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.427
My mom has been alive
all these years,

04:13.470 --> 04:15.516
living in the city
where I grew up.

04:16.038 --> 04:19.476
A lot of it's destroyed,
but most of it's been rebuilt,

04:19.520 --> 04:20.738
and it's exactly the same.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
Like, I never thought that
I would smell the Dar-Essa
flower again,

04:24.612 --> 04:26.091
but look,
there are dozens of them.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.921
I can't imagine
what that felt like.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.621
It just felt like home.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.754
So you wanna go back.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.805
I've tried so hard
to make Earth my home, Alex.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.156
And it has been,
because of you.

04:48.026 --> 04:51.203
You've been so much more
than a sister to me.

04:52.248 --> 04:55.295
When I first got here,
I was alone, and scared,

04:55.556 --> 04:57.645
having just lost everything.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.910
And I would walk around
and feel this dull,

05:03.172 --> 05:06.871
empty pit, a hollowness.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.961
And, yeah, we got off
to a rocky start,

05:10.005 --> 05:14.052
but once we got close,
that hollowness
just disappeared.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.359
That was you.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.579
You filled my heart.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.279
And no matter where I go,
you will always be in it.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.197
How long will you be gone?

05:31.896 --> 05:33.115
I don't know.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.425
I feel...

05:39.991 --> 05:41.515
Guilty. I...

05:43.430 --> 05:45.170
I feel selfish.

05:45.780 --> 05:46.868
Hey.

05:48.652 --> 05:52.526
You have given all of us
so much as Supergirl.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.354
Reign is gone.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.880
You have dedicated
your whole life
to taking care of others.

05:58.923 --> 06:02.492
It's time for Kara Zor-El
to take care of herself.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.365
And no one deserves that
more than you.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.368
But,

06:09.194 --> 06:10.239
selfishly,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.287
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

06:19.117 --> 06:23.383
When you went away to college,
we figured that out,
we did that.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.212
Yeah, I mean, we called
and e-mailed every day.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.302
What's Wi

06:37.919 --> 06:39.486
I can't believe
you're going back.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.531
I know. Neither can I.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.187
It's gonna be really hard
to be away from everyone.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.189
-It's your home.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:49.191 --> 06:51.541
Hey, thank you for everything,
by the way.

06:51.802 --> 06:55.197
For coming back in,
and helping, and being
part of the team.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.721
It's really meant a lot to me.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.375
Yeah, well, a while ago,
someone pretty great

06:59.419 --> 07:00.855
taught me how to be a hero.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.813
She didn't do a bad job.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.559
Hey, uh, while you're in Argo,
would you do me a favor?

07:09.907 --> 07:11.692
They have artificial
gravity there,

07:11.735 --> 07:14.216
which means they have some
sort of synthetic
gravity manipulator.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.739
And since gravity
can bend space-time,

07:15.783 --> 07:17.393
you can use it to
send a beacon
into the future,

07:17.437 --> 07:19.351
and let the Legion know
they can come back and get me.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.440
You're leaving, too?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.747
Why don't you
just come with me?

07:25.314 --> 07:26.881
I wouldn't wanna
crash your homecoming.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.839
You wouldn't be
crashing anything.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.711
It would be lovely
to have you there.

07:31.842 --> 07:32.887
You're serious?

07:32.930 --> 07:34.192
Absolutely.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.760
Okay.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.242
The woman of the hour!

07:40.547 --> 07:41.809
-Hey!

07:41.852 --> 07:44.202
You guys
did not have to do this.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.769
Oh, come on, did you think
we were gonna send you off

07:45.813 --> 07:48.424
into outer space sabbatical
without the right send

07:49.947 --> 07:51.471
There's only one Supergirl,

07:53.298 --> 07:55.475
but we will all do our best
to channel your spirit
in your honor,

07:55.518 --> 07:58.303
protect National City
with pride,
and make you proud.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.349
-Toast. Toast.
Toast!

08:00.392 --> 08:02.220
Yeah!
-Come on, make a speech.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.483
Speech.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.397
I'm really gonna
miss you guys.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.617
This world was

08:08.052 --> 08:10.315
so foreign and terrifying.

08:11.795 --> 08:15.625
But over the years,
I've learned to feel
safe here.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.585
It's been an honor
protecting this planet,

08:18.628 --> 08:20.412
and being protected by it.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.850
And I owe all of that to you.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.852
Hear, hear.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.685
You are my friends
who understand me,

08:32.076 --> 08:33.469
and make me laugh.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.124
You are my role models,

08:36.167 --> 08:38.169
who have built me
into a leader

08:38.213 --> 08:41.564
and shown me what it means
to find fulfillment
in the work we do.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.743
This world
has given me a family.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.662
I'm taking this chance
to revisit my home,

08:52.706 --> 08:54.359
my first home.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.493
I'm bringing you all
with me in my heart.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.321
And I'm at peace
knowing you'll be

08:59.364 --> 09:01.541
holding down the fort here
until I'm back.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.462
And this is not goodbye.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.377
It's "See you
on the flipside."

09:15.250 --> 09:17.121
Or as we say on Krypton...

09:19.646 --> 09:21.082
"To be continued."

09:30.657 --> 09:33.224
It's so good
to have you back, Kara Zor-El.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.139
It's good to be back.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.837
Welcome home.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.590
My certificate of Kanar-Onn!

09:51.242 --> 09:52.287
What's that?

09:52.330 --> 09:53.854
A Kryptonian rite of passage

09:54.115 --> 09:58.467
requiring hours and hours
of studies of
Kryptonian history.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.339
You loved it.
I would come home
every day and find you

10:01.383 --> 10:04.125
pouring over books,
rattling off new information
you discovered.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.606
Thank you.
-Okay, maybe
I was a bit of a nerd.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.259
Uh, that sounds about right.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.220
Wow! It's really you!

10:13.134 --> 10:14.178
Thara?

10:14.222 --> 10:15.658
We all thought you were dead.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.617
The ceremony broke my heart.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
I can't believe my eyes.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.534
Neither can I.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.580
Your parents, your brother?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.843
I'm the only one who survived.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.324
I'm so sorry, Thara.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.587
I've recovered.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.676
And with you,

10:33.720 --> 10:35.025
it's a miracle.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.637
You've lived on another planet
all these years,

10:37.898 --> 10:39.900
a planet where you can fly?

10:39.943 --> 10:41.379
Yes. Uh...

10:41.728 --> 10:43.730
There's so much to tell you.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.645
We'll have to climb up
onto the roof,

10:46.080 --> 10:47.385
fill each other in.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.909
I would love that.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.737
Oh.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.173
Thara Agfar

10:52.216 --> 10:55.437
this is Mon-El
of the Legion of Superheroes.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.006
-Hi.
-Hi, it's just like
a space police.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.704
Well, Thara is in
law enforcement as well.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.488
She's Chief Peace Officer
on Argo.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.318
Times have been peaceful
ever since we resettled,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.407
thanks to Alura and the work
of the High Council.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.106
Well, we all play our part,
but Thara has really
stepped up.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.021
She knows the city
like the back of her hand.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.763
Well, maybe you can help us
find something for Mon-El.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.503
Right. Um...

11:18.547 --> 11:20.897
A synthetic
gravity manipulator?

11:21.768 --> 11:24.335
There's a guy in the market
who sells anything
with a microchip.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.685
Great.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.991
And after that, I'd love
for you to meet my family.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.601
Your family?

11:29.645 --> 11:31.691
My husband, Lir-Al
and our two kids.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.650
Okay,
we really need to catch up.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.918
Nothing?

11:42.353 --> 11:43.615
There's nothing going on?

11:43.833 --> 11:46.270
Nada.Not even a jaywalker.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.404
How did Supergirl
do this on quiet nights?

11:51.406 --> 11:52.624
Yeah,
she would stay home.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.018
Oh, yeah, right.
The luxury of super hearing.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.193
Yeah, right?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.152
I mean, dealing
with the slow days is

11:58.195 --> 12:01.285
just all a part of learning
to do things without her.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.287
You think Kara's gonna stay?

12:03.331 --> 12:05.550
I don't know, man, I just...
I got a feeling that

12:06.726 --> 12:08.945
we're gonna be seeing
a lot less of her.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.992
Well, let's call it a day,
shall we?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.036
Hold it right there.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.603
-Hold on.
Freeze!

12:14.646 --> 12:16.083
I thought I heard something.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.258
Uh-oh, there's a bank
around the corner.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.264
Stop!

12:25.309 --> 12:26.876
I said stop right there!

12:46.287 --> 12:47.767
-Yeah.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.290
Thanks.

12:50.595 --> 12:51.901
Was that a cannon?
What kind of gun was that?

12:55.209 --> 12:56.776
Kara always hated the opera.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.910
But I'm sure
that if she had heard Puccini,

13:00.954 --> 13:02.651
she would absolutely love it.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.045
Yeah, I miss her, too.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.918
Hey, you know, you should
come with us to the opera
next week.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.748
The complex rhythms
and orchestrations
of the music,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.185
I think really benefited
my father's memory.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.839
Isn't that right, Father?

13:17.884 --> 13:19.363
I cannot go.

13:19.407 --> 13:22.149
No, I was just telling Alex
about your love of opera.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.151
She may come
with us next week.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.935
You should not make
plans for me, J'onn.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.156
That is what I was speaking
about when you asked
about my mind.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.768
Why not, Father?
You've been so lucid lately.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.989
He's been better
than he has been for weeks.

13:36.685 --> 13:40.732
The surge of clarity
that comes right before
the end.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.474
I've been wanting
to tell you, my son.

13:45.215 --> 13:48.349
The time has come
for us to perform The Reach.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.092
"The Reach"?

13:52.135 --> 13:54.007
An ancient rite on Mars.

13:54.268 --> 13:58.054
The elder generation passes
down their memories,
their knowledge,

13:58.533 --> 14:01.884
all the experiences
of their life,

14:01.928 --> 14:03.103
before they pass.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.975
You are not passing
anytime soon, Father.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.499
You are better.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.110
I am not.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.636
And if we don't begin
The Reach before
the beginning of my end,

14:14.679 --> 14:17.900
all of my Mars memories
will be lost forever.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.208
Alex, will you please
tell my father
he's nowhere near his end?

14:22.383 --> 14:23.993
Alex, please tell him.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.214
J'onn,
that's not my place to say.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.998
I mean,
only your father knows.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
And I do know.

14:32.828 --> 14:37.615
The time we've spent together
these past months have been

14:38.486 --> 14:40.749
the most joyous of my life.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.883
But all the memories
we've preserved

14:43.926 --> 14:45.885
by doing the Ta'ar Ka'riq

14:45.928 --> 14:48.583
are at risk if we don't
begin the process.

14:48.626 --> 14:52.065
We...
We will preserve them, Father.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
Just...

14:55.198 --> 14:56.547
Just not yet.

14:57.984 --> 14:58.985
I...

15:00.029 --> 15:02.118
Oh, there's a situation
at work.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.164
I'm sorry, um,
I have to go.

15:04.425 --> 15:05.687
I'll... I'll come with you.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.864
We'll talk about this later.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.824
Do not forget
what I've said, my son.

15:16.437 --> 15:19.135
It hurts me to see
a masterpiece in ruins, man.

15:19.179 --> 15:23.009
It's like the Picassos
that went down with
the Titanic,you know?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.839
I heard you went
into a bank robbery,

15:27.883 --> 15:29.754
with some kind
of concerning weaponry.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.452
Alien guns again?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.715
I would say DEO weaponry.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.934
This one to be exact.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
A DEO assault rifle?

15:37.414 --> 15:39.068
What? No, that's impossible.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.244
After Agent Schott's
mother raided this place,

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
I had every weapon
in here microchipped.

15:43.029 --> 15:46.075
Look, J'onn, I saw it,
I felt it. It was yours.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.209
Yeah, we even did
a ballistics test

15:49.252 --> 15:50.950
out on the firing range.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.865
Yeah, we shot
this weapon at that shield

15:54.344 --> 15:55.389
from the same distance.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.958
Which one was which?

15:59.001 --> 16:02.309
-Because the impact
is identical.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.486
That's just impossible.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.140
We use proprietary technology,

16:07.183 --> 16:09.272
guns solely designed
for our use.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.536
Somebody shot this weapon
at me and a cop,
and he got away.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.016
I just want to catch the guy

16:14.060 --> 16:15.409
because if he has this one,
he might have ten more.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.759
We are down one
bulletproof superhero,

16:17.802 --> 16:20.544
so I suggest that we follow
the only lead that we have
at this point.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.199
All right, Agent Schott,

16:23.243 --> 16:25.680
keep pushing with
the ballistics, see if it was
this gun that was used.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.290
Yup.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.988
There's only one other place
this gun might have come from.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.294
Let's go talk to
the manufacturer.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.384
Why are you smiling?

16:34.689 --> 16:37.518
It just feels amazing
to be normal.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.173
I'm actually relieved
I can't fly.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.783
No one to save.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.003
Do you hear that undetectable
sound in the distance?

16:44.046 --> 16:45.091
No.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.135
Exactly.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.746
-Mon-El!
-Oh, hey.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.052
How you feeling, buddy?

16:50.096 --> 16:51.401
-Good.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.534
Hey, Kara, this is Val.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.057
Nice to meet you.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.842
New friend?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.061
Mon-El saved his life.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.932
Healed him
with the device from his belt.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.457
It's a development
from the future.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.286
Saving people
without telling me, hmm?

17:08.070 --> 17:09.376
I can't thank you enough.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.117
-Of course.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.032
Watch out!

17:28.482 --> 17:29.570
I'll see you, buddy.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.097
Well, they're gonna
be all right.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.926
I'm just grateful
neither of you were hurt.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.188
I'm so sorry.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.886
Usually, our construction
sites are up to code,

17:42.583 --> 17:44.672
but it turns out, this one
hadn't been inspected yet.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.413
So, you think
it was an accident?

17:46.848 --> 17:47.849
Of course.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.546
Why

17:50.765 --> 17:52.158
I'm not sure. Um...

17:52.897 --> 17:54.812
I saw someone after it fell

17:55.596 --> 17:56.640
running away.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.164
It could've been anyone.

17:58.207 --> 18:02.081
It's just, in my life,
nothing happens for no reason.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.430
There are no accidents.

18:03.778 --> 18:04.779
That was on Earth.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.608
Do you think you could look
into it further?

18:07.912 --> 18:10.045
-Of course.
We'll get right on it.
-Thank you.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.133
I'll see you two later?

18:11.177 --> 18:12.178
-Yes.
-Of course. Yeah.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.528
Are you sure you're all right?

18:14.963 --> 18:16.617
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.705
Okay.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.145
Do you think
I'm being paranoid?

18:23.493 --> 18:26.322
If I've learned anything,
it's that your instincts are

18:26.757 --> 18:28.150
usually spot on.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.112
I think you should take this.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.201
-No, Mon-El, don't--
-It's just in case.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.898
It will allow you to fly.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.690
Thank you.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.997
Mr. J'onzz, Mr. Olsen.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.259
Thanks for waiting.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.479
Thank you
for seeing us, Mr. Preston,

18:52.522 --> 18:53.393
we won't take up
too much of your time.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.350
We just have a few questions.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.438
No problem.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.876
Contract with your division
of the FBI is one of
our most important.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.227
Have there been any missing
shipments of weapons?

19:01.270 --> 19:02.315
Uh...

19:03.098 --> 19:04.491
Anything from your factories?

19:04.534 --> 19:05.666
Absolutely not.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.624
Well, the suspect, um,

19:09.496 --> 19:12.194
used a weapon identical
to one of Director J'onzz's
assault rifles

19:12.586 --> 19:14.631
and used it to shoot
at a police officer.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.459
Is the officer all right?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.983
-He will be.
-That's a relief.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.638
Well, as for theories,

19:21.682 --> 19:25.076
the criminal may have
purchased one of
our Heel-14 rifles

19:25.120 --> 19:26.600
and modified it
with a bump stock.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.168
I'm sorry, a "Heel

19:29.864 --> 19:31.561
We designed a civilian version

19:31.605 --> 19:33.520
of the assault rifle
we produce for you.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.436
Not to worry,
it's perfectly legal

19:36.479 --> 19:38.351
and in line with our contract.
It's a hunting rifle.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.180
That is not a hunting rifle.

19:41.876 --> 19:45.358
Someone used a weapon
we designed and used it
against a police officer.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.577
And that is not your fault
any more than it's mine.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.362
Yeah, but you can
do something about it.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.841
You can stop selling
that weapon.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.757
I have 2,000 employees to pay.

19:53.801 --> 19:56.934
Taking any of our products
off the market hurts
every one of them.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.284
This is a family business,

19:58.327 --> 19:59.981
and our guns
bring families together.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.244
I remember when my grandpa
gave me my first hunting rifle

20:02.288 --> 20:03.550
and taught me how to shoot.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.769
It was
an inter-generational
experience.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.990
And it's my hope to help
as many Americans as possible

20:09.033 --> 20:10.383
capture that feeling,

20:10.426 --> 20:11.688
and pass it
on to their children.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.299
Look, no one values families
more than I do,

20:13.342 --> 20:14.822
but that is not for families.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.217
That is for military
personnel, trained officers,
law enforcement.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.175
All right, here's what's
gonna happen right now.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.829
You are gonna
hand over all documentation

20:21.872 --> 20:23.657
relating to the Heel-14,

20:23.700 --> 20:26.529
and you're gonna comply
completely, 100% with
our investigation.

20:26.573 --> 20:29.228
If you do not, we'll take
our business elsewhere.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.100
Of course, I'll comply.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.146
I wouldn't dream
of standing in the way

20:35.190 --> 20:36.670
of your investigation.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.367
Oh, you just dream of a world

20:38.411 --> 20:40.369
where everybody's armed
to the teeth, right?

20:40.413 --> 20:43.590
And you dream of a world where
every person reads
CatComagazine.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.245
We're both businessmen,
Mr. Olsen.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.817
Do you mind if I come in here
and work with you?

20:53.861 --> 20:55.384
I've got a ton
of reading to do.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.082
Anybody who brings
a mountain of pizza
into this office

20:58.126 --> 20:59.954
can stay
for as long as they want.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.129
I know, I brought too much.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.391
So, what are you working on?

21:02.435 --> 21:04.132
I thought the issue
went to print at 5:00.

21:04.175 --> 21:07.135
That did, but, uh,
now I'm trying to track down

21:07.178 --> 21:10.051
a gunman by using
the weapon that he used.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.967
Clark did an expose
on the gun epidemic

21:13.010 --> 21:14.273
for the Daily Planet
years ago.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.840
And I'm trying to figure out
how he was able

21:16.884 --> 21:19.974
to track a private sale
of an assault weapon
without a registry. So...

21:20.017 --> 21:22.281
People don't like
the government keeping track
of the guns they own.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.021
I never really
understood that argument,

21:24.370 --> 21:26.633
that someone's right
to own an assault weapon

21:26.676 --> 21:29.549
is more important than
someone's right to go
to school safely.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.465
I have a gun for self-defense.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.989
I have used it
for self-defense.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.342
You're not telling me
that you're one
of these people

21:40.386 --> 21:43.432
that thinks that having
a gun makes everybody
safer, right?

21:44.172 --> 21:45.956
We disagree,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.090
but I can see your side
and hopefully, you can see
my side, too.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.832
I'm open to listening.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.617
Good, 'cause things get done
when we listen to each other.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.229
Speaking of which,
I can hear that pizza talking.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.927
That is a lot of pizza.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.103
-Yeah, I'm sorry...
It's fine.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.539
Ms. Tessmacher?

22:04.235 --> 22:05.759
Yes, Mr. Olsen?

22:05.802 --> 22:08.544
We are gonna need your stomach
on at least two of these.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.590
Thank you. Could I get
either of you anything?

22:10.633 --> 22:12.374
You know, Eve, I could really
do with a cup of coffee.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.377
This article on spontaneous
fishing is seriously dry.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.205
Is that the one by Forrester?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.250
Scientific Universe Journal?

22:19.729 --> 22:20.774
-Yeah.
-You need to check out

22:20.817 --> 22:22.471
Jen Steinmetz-O'Grady's work.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
I studied with her at Yale.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.213
Her brain is

22:26.040 --> 22:27.084
beyond.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.652
I'll be right back
with that coffee.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.786
Did you know
Eve studied nuclear physics?

22:32.829 --> 22:35.441
There is nothing that
surprises me about
Eve anymore.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.143
Did you find
the gravity manipulator
you were looking for?

22:42.186 --> 22:44.841
I did, but the guy who sold it
to me was sort of an oddball.

22:44.885 --> 22:45.973
Do you know him?

22:46.016 --> 22:47.148
Ol-Irus.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.236
Everybody knows him.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.107
Ol

22:50.151 --> 22:53.284
Uh-huh. Do you remember
that time he made us take home

22:53.328 --> 22:54.721
insect samples to study,

22:54.764 --> 22:57.114
and they reproduced
by the hundreds in our houses?

22:59.943 --> 23:01.380
Well, maybe you weren't
so good at your
insect homework,

23:01.423 --> 23:03.382
but I'm sure you are
an amazing mother.

23:03.817 --> 23:04.905
Yeah, she is.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.515
Hmm.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.430
And, uh, your children,
where are they tonight?

23:08.909 --> 23:10.084
They're with the babysitter.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.566
Whose mother, Laura,
is our landscape architect.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.395
Please don't bring it up.
It's all so distressing.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.399
We're building a gazebo
in our backyard.

23:20.442 --> 23:24.098
It's been carved out
of this huge,
beautiful piece of stone

23:24.141 --> 23:26.013
that was left
from the wreckage.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.841
We couldn't have been
more clear with Laura

23:27.884 --> 23:29.625
that we wanted it
to face south.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.236
So that we could enjoy
the lake off the orchard
in the evening.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.890
And she's carved it
in the wrong direction.

23:34.195 --> 23:37.024
So, now we have
this stone monolith

23:37.067 --> 23:38.634
in our backyard
that's facing the woods.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.114
Nothing can be done about it.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.203
It's so tragic.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.424
Well, I mean,
it's not that bad.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.904
You'll see that the direction
you're facing matters
a great deal.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.253
Of course it does.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.516
It affects your mood.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.952
And your quality of sleep.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.302
Well, we will find
a way to manage.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.346
Uh, excuse me.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.008
Hey!

24:05.400 --> 24:06.445
Hey!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.925
You were
at the marketplace earlier.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.144
I saw you.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.406
Are you spying on me?

24:11.754 --> 24:12.973
Kara, what's going on?

24:13.016 --> 24:14.801
She was there
right after the crane fell.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.977
It's not true. I wasn't there.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.195
I know what I saw!

24:18.500 --> 24:19.632
Why do you want to hurt me?

24:19.675 --> 24:20.676
Tell me!

24:20.937 --> 24:22.199
She's crazy.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.549
I did nothing.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.202
You're lying.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.291
Now, you're gonna
tell me who you are,

24:27.335 --> 24:28.728
and what you want with me,

24:28.771 --> 24:31.252
or I promise you,
you will regret it.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.820
Kara, enough.
Felra, go home.

24:35.256 --> 24:36.866
Her husband owns the grocery.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.651
I've known her for years.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.654
She would never hurt anyone,
let alone somebody
she's never met.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.050
Let's call it a night.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.139
Kara, please, go home.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.837
Get some rest.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.502
Have we identified
any potential suspects yet?

25:03.937 --> 25:05.416
Uh, not yet.
We've been going off

25:05.460 --> 25:07.244
that list that you had
from the gun manufacturer,

25:07.288 --> 25:10.030
but trying to locate
the weapons like this
is particularly hard.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.249
There's no digital trail,
there's no paper trail.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.904
All we can do is actually
call the individual retailers

25:14.948 --> 25:15.992
that sold the guns.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.777
Well, what are we waiting for?

25:17.820 --> 25:18.995
I want that guy found
and off the streets
as soon as possible

25:19.039 --> 25:21.215
before he can use
that weapon on anybody else.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.219
You're not avoiding
going home, are you?

25:26.742 --> 25:27.961
No, I'm not.

25:29.919 --> 25:30.920
Okay.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.363
Thara spoke with the owner
of that construction site.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.409
The pillar fell
because of a part

25:41.452 --> 25:43.498
they were having
trouble with in the past.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.108
She also checked.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.241
Felra was at work
when it happened,

25:47.284 --> 25:49.635
so if you saw someone
suspicious, it wasn't her.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.422
Kara.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.036
I know that being
back here is an adjustment.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.258
The remnants of your home
that you thought
had been destroyed...

26:05.302 --> 26:06.782
Believe me, I understand.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.482
I was haunted for a long time
by the end of our planet.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.225
And the loss of your father,

26:16.966 --> 26:19.403
it wasn't easy
to regain a sense of peace.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.450
So, how'd you do it?

26:22.798 --> 26:24.147
Oh, it took time.

26:27.107 --> 26:31.067
I'm so happy to be here
with you, and Thara.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.548
And yet...

26:35.332 --> 26:37.160
I do feel unsettled.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.772
Well, the accident yesterday
didn't help.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.472
I know it sounds crazy,
but I don't think
it was an accident.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.517
I think something's behind it,

26:46.561 --> 26:49.129
and I have always
followed my intuition.

26:49.782 --> 26:50.783
Kara,

26:52.132 --> 26:54.656
you've had to live
your life as a warrior,

26:55.570 --> 26:58.399
surviving on a foreign planet,
defending others.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.489
You have to take in the fact

27:01.532 --> 27:03.491
that you don't have to live
that way anymore.

27:04.971 --> 27:08.757
You've spent so much time
taking care of others.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.718
Maybe it's finally time
that you take care
of yourself.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.725
It's funny, my sister, Alex,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.903
she almost said
the exact same thing.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.037
Well, I know why you
love her so much.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.608
Any leads
on tracking the gun owner?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.392
Listen,
we were only able to identify

27:35.436 --> 27:38.134
like, 10% of the people
that actually purchased
the Heel-14,

27:38.178 --> 27:40.310
and that is with
state-of-the-art tracking.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.182
So, what's the next move?

27:42.443 --> 27:43.836
Old-fashioned police line-up.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.141
We need you to take
a look at some photos, James,

27:45.185 --> 27:47.187
see if you recognize the guy
who bought the gun.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.538
Winn, let's start with
the guys that purchased
more than one weapon.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.931
-Okay.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.717
That's him.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.980
Bottom right corner,
Arthur Willis.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.026
Okay. Arthur Willis.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.332
Are you sure?

28:02.376 --> 28:04.465
'Cause this says that
he passed his instant
background check

28:04.508 --> 28:05.640
at the gun show.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.468
He has no history
of mental health issues.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.165
I mean, he doesn't
seem like a threat.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.601
I don't forget a face.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.386
How many guns did he buy?

28:12.647 --> 28:15.737
Uh, let's see.
Four that I can see.

28:15.781 --> 28:16.825
Get a strike team together.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.044
Wait, a strike team?

28:18.087 --> 28:19.393
What do you want
me to do, James?

28:19.436 --> 28:20.437
If you send your guys
out there

28:20.481 --> 28:21.569
with the same
weapons as him,

28:21.612 --> 28:22.918
it's gonna turn
into a war zone.

28:22.962 --> 28:24.659
I need my guys to be armed

28:24.703 --> 28:26.269
to defend themselves,
and protect the public.

28:26.313 --> 28:27.793
We're not the bad guys here.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.838
Sometimes, without trying,
we can be part of the problem.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.448
Uh, I'm so sorry
to interrupt,

28:31.492 --> 28:33.450
I have just been perusing
Arthur's social media

28:33.494 --> 28:35.975
and he just posted
what looks like a manifesto.

28:37.803 --> 28:38.934
"To whom it concerns,

28:38.978 --> 28:40.196
so you understand why.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.720
For those who ruined my life,

28:43.547 --> 28:45.332
for the partners of Vang
and Morales who spit on me
when they fired me."

28:45.636 --> 28:47.334
Vang and Morales,
that is a law firm.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.424
It's in the same
business plaza as the bank

28:50.467 --> 28:53.122
where the cops spotted him.
He wasn't robbing the bank.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.863
He's going back to his office.

29:18.931 --> 29:22.108
He threatened to file
a lawsuit for wrongful
termination.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.458
But he had outburst
after outburst.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.242
Did the firm offer
mental health counseling?

29:26.286 --> 29:27.330
Of course.

29:27.374 --> 29:28.592
But he refused.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.029
We're gonna find him.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.249
All the entrances are secure.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.685
We're checking
the building right now.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.339
Did you check the cellar?

29:36.862 --> 29:39.473
There's a back way
into the loading dock,

29:39.516 --> 29:41.214
but there's no cameras
on that door.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.390
-South side of the building.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.913
I'm on it.

29:50.876 --> 29:51.920
Arthur?

29:51.964 --> 29:53.835
-Don't move.

29:54.705 --> 29:55.750
I'm unarmed.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.838
Who are you?

29:56.882 --> 29:58.274
Just someone
who wants to talk.

29:58.753 --> 30:01.103
Yeah, well, it's too late
for that now.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.715
No one wanted to listen to me
before, but they are gonna
listen to me now.

30:05.064 --> 30:07.806
This is the only way
for me to be heard.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.069
Arthur,
if you pull that trigger,

30:10.765 --> 30:12.898
no one's gonna listen
to a thing you have to say.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.509
They took everything from me!

30:16.466 --> 30:18.642
My wife left me
because I was always working,

30:18.686 --> 30:21.254
then they just kept
passing me over for partner.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.429
They lied to me!

30:23.996 --> 30:25.824
Look, I know you feel like
they took everything from you,

30:26.085 --> 30:27.564
like you got nothing left.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.829
Trust me, I know how it feels
to lose everything.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.919
They never respected me.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.312
You think that gun
gives you respect?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.358
It has no power.

30:38.401 --> 30:41.056
It's just a tool for spreading
fear, and fear is not

30:41.665 --> 30:42.884
respect.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.886
Look, Arthur, I know
you've been bullied,

30:45.191 --> 30:47.497
but that doesn't give you
the right to bully back.

30:47.802 --> 30:50.544
You got something loud
and ugly there.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.589
You think that's gonna
make people hear you?

30:52.633 --> 30:54.287
I shot at a cop!

30:55.897 --> 30:58.900
My life is over
no matter what.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.250
Your life doesn't
have to end like this.

31:01.685 --> 31:02.817
You can go on,

31:04.558 --> 31:06.255
you can change, you can...

31:08.257 --> 31:09.737
You can begin something new...

31:12.218 --> 31:14.133
If you just put down that gun.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.264
No!

31:19.573 --> 31:20.574
I need it.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.707
You don't need it, Arthur.

31:26.493 --> 31:27.886
None of us do.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.325
Give me the gun.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.416
Come on.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.250
That's good.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.949
Good man.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.431
Good man.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.610
When we were young,
we were so similar,

33:23.653 --> 33:25.568
we could predict
each other's thoughts.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.613
And now...

33:28.310 --> 33:30.704
Now she's governed by
the Kryptonian version
of feng shui?

33:32.227 --> 33:33.402
Basically, yeah.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.188
I do envy her, though.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.192
I want that happiness
for myself.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.586
I just don't know
if I have it in me.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.026
And what I do know

33:48.678 --> 33:50.550
is that I'm very happy
you're here.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.901
Your friendship has made
this whole journey

33:54.467 --> 33:55.946
a lot easier.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.209
So, thank you.

34:04.607 --> 34:05.608
Uh...

34:06.783 --> 34:09.090
-Yeah,
I just didn't want to...

34:09.786 --> 34:13.355
I didn't want to burden you
before. Um...

34:16.271 --> 34:19.622
I know you've moved on...
From us.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.715
But I didn't just come back
here to help you fight Reign.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.850
When I left Imra,
she asked me to

34:30.633 --> 34:32.070
sort out how I felt.

34:33.419 --> 34:34.985
And not just about her.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.076
About you.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.514
And I've been trying
to convince myself

34:41.557 --> 34:44.691
that friendship between us
was the right thing.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.524
But I think I've been
lying to myself.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.660
I'm sorry to spring this
on you in the midst of you

34:57.921 --> 34:59.880
trying to acclimate here.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.186
Don't be sorry.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.188
I just don't want
to hide things,

35:04.189 --> 35:05.842
pretend like they don't exist.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.151
After you left,

35:11.631 --> 35:15.461
I had a dream where I was
walking down this path.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.725
A lot like this one.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.902
It was peaceful,
and serene and...

35:24.948 --> 35:27.255
You were there,
waiting for me.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.219
And all I wanted was for you
to be in that field with me.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.136

36:24.269 --> 36:26.314
have done for the survival
of this city,

36:26.358 --> 36:28.011
how could you betray that?

36:30.013 --> 36:32.146
We are the daughters
of the night,

36:32.712 --> 36:34.409
children of Juru,

36:35.062 --> 36:37.717
the deliverance
of all Krypton.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.590
And Selena
is our high priestess.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.592
Selena?

36:44.071 --> 36:45.899
But she helped me
defeat Reign.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.075
Nothing is as it seems.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.037
It's your mother.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.343
We have to go.

36:56.388 --> 36:57.563
You sure you can do this?

36:57.606 --> 37:00.043
Oh, yeah, yeah.
99% sure.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.046
Dude, that is as sure
as you're allowed
to be in science.

37:03.656 --> 37:04.831
Are you sure you can do this?

37:06.659 --> 37:07.921
I am.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.578
All right, everybody,
gather around.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.362
I have an important
announcement to make.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.586
Today,
we had to deal with a crisis,

37:20.629 --> 37:23.066
which sadly has become
all too common in our country.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.287
Normally, this would not fall
onto the purview of the DEO,

37:26.331 --> 37:28.594
but because of the decisions
I've made about how we choose

37:28.637 --> 37:30.248
to protect ourselves,

37:30.509 --> 37:31.814
we played a role.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.816
But I must make a stand today

37:33.860 --> 37:35.992
and do something I should've
done a long time ago.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.517
Your safety is
my number one priority.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.649
The DEO will begin phasing out

37:40.693 --> 37:42.347
the use of weapons
of lethal force.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.306
We are destroying our guns.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.311
Director J'onzz, sir,
I'm sorry,

37:50.355 --> 37:52.270
but how are we supposed
to defend ourselves?

37:52.313 --> 37:54.750
I know this transition may be
difficult for some of you.

37:54.794 --> 37:57.666
Agent Schott will be
developing a line of
non-lethal weapons

37:57.710 --> 38:00.147
which we will begin using
as soon as possible.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.324
I know some of you may
find this uncomfortable.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.239
If so,
I won't stand in your way.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.677
I will be happy to help you
transition to another unit.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.341
But I believe
we can have a lasting,

38:20.385 --> 38:23.518
important and necessary impact
on the world by doing this.

38:24.127 --> 38:26.782
The greatest strength
in the universe lies
not in war,

38:26.826 --> 38:28.262
but in peace.

38:29.089 --> 38:32.048
We are agents of peace.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.791
Thank you. Yeah.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.315
Dismissed.

38:39.404 --> 38:40.405
Director J'onzz.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.756
I heard what you said
about strength and peace,

38:43.799 --> 38:44.800
and I believe in that.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.805
That's why the only weapon
anyone needs is a shield.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.766
That's something my father
taught me a long time ago.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.551
Thank you for helping me
remember that, James.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.525
I really can't thank you
enough for bringing me on.

39:13.568 --> 39:17.050
It's such an honor, and to be
doing a project
for Supergirl...

39:18.443 --> 39:19.487
What is it?

39:20.445 --> 39:21.968
It's this Harun-El.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.144
If this data is correct,

39:24.187 --> 39:26.973
it's more than just
a biolistic delivery system.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.844
It could be revolutionary.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.210
I'm sorry
I wasn't ready before,

39:47.950 --> 39:49.256
but I am now.

39:52.477 --> 39:53.913
Are you sure?

41:02.503 --> 41:03.461
Where is the ship?

41:03.983 --> 41:04.984
It's gone.

41:05.854 --> 41:06.855
Look.
