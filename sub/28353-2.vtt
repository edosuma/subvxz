WEBVTT

00:07.340 --> 00:08.466
It was here.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.512
It was just here. Why is it not
here? No! No! No! No! Oh!

00:12.595 --> 00:15.765
Shit. Shit. Shit. It was
here. I swear to God.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.058
Yeah, here we go again.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.560
Another RollerWorld delusion.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.520
No, no, no. I can prove it.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.189
Look. We'll find the perp.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.528
Holy shit! Where did you find it?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.655
- Wait, the green's real?
- RollerWorld's real.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.783
Wait. What was that?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.785
- Yeah, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.747
Not important. Okay,
okay, we got something.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.250
My parents, who are completely
disrespecting my privacy...

00:42.333 --> 00:44.377
And about to get it in on your bed.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.838
No, they're not about to get it in.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.381
Nah.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.133
Oh, my God.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.730
No.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.762
No, no, no. Stop. Don't do that.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.890
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:57.930 --> 00:59.120
Here, take it. I can't...

00:59.130 --> 01:00.560
- can't do this.
- Ugh!

01:00.643 --> 01:02.771
- Hmm.
- Ugh, okay.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.067
It's over. Okay. I'll never be
able to look at them again.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.571
Wait. Why is she in my closet?

01:14.866 --> 01:16.785
Mom!

01:20.371 --> 01:21.915
Oh, my doll.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.293
Oh, my God!

01:25.376 --> 01:28.171
- Oh, my God!
- Aren't you guys tired already?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.381
What? You were supposed
to lock the door!

01:34.594 --> 01:36.930
- Wipe it off. Come on.
- We got it.

01:41.050 --> 01:42.184
Hi.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.769
You okay?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.856
Seriously, this whole situation
is potentially scarring.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.192
But I don't have time to get into that.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.050
Where's my gym bag?

01:51.945 --> 01:52.990
With my football gear.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.420
It was in my closet.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.991
Oh, the stinky one.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.450
It's gone.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.537
It's not like you're
playing football anymore.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.039
I needed to get in my
year-end tax deductions,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.124
so I donated it.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.335
You... donated it?!

02:08.100 --> 02:10.520
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

02:14.134 --> 02:15.552
Why is that down there?

02:16.177 --> 02:18.471
- Better safe than sorry.
- Understandable.

02:18.550 --> 02:20.060
Okay, so I've cracked the case.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.980
The money's at the Goodwill. Let's roll.

02:22.010 --> 02:24.561
- What? We can't go now.
- Yeah, Jamal, think about it.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.231
You're right. It's a full
moon, but don't worry, Monse.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.567
- Werewolves don't like dark me.
- It's not the moon.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.600
It's New Years in Freeridge.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.362
Drunk drivers and drunk
people with guns.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.489
No one's hitting up the
Goodwill at this hour.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.573
Good night.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.411
You all suck... and I hate you.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.664
See you tomorrow morning?

02:44.747 --> 02:47.292
0800 hours, don't be late!

02:47.709 --> 02:49.069
You don't need to do this.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.671
It's not safe for you to
be walking home alone.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.882
But it's safe for a 15-year-old
Santo who's been put off

02:53.965 --> 02:55.633
to be sleeping on the streets?

02:55.710 --> 02:57.320
I don't understand why you
couldn't just ask Ruby

02:57.340 --> 02:58.469
or Jamal to crash with them.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.306
Ruby's mom shut me out
when I came to the party.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.016
So why would it be any
different at Jamal's?

03:03.099 --> 03:06.311
- No one needs the risk. Just let it be.
- Let it be?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.605
Seriously? Who do you
think you're talking to?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.857
Just come inside. My
dad's never gonna know.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.859
But I know. And you promised.

03:16.946 --> 03:17.947
I have a workaround.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.037
My dad said you couldn't
stay inside our home,

03:24.120 --> 03:26.164
but he never said
anything about his car.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.667
Monse, house, car, it's
all the same thing.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.545
He doesn't want me around and I get it.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.380
If I were him, I'd feel the same way.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.800
I'll figure something out. Good night.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.260
Don't just "good night" me.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.300
Good night.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.475
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.396
I'm leaving it unlocked.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.816
You sure you want to yell that?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.659
Ruby! Mass is in 20 minutes.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.911
I'm not going.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.579
Are you sick?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.373
- No.
- You're in pain.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.043
- Oh, you're constipated again?
- Mom, no!

04:12.126 --> 04:14.170
- I just don't feel like going.
- Oh, you're going.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.464
Why? She's not.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.216
I'm an atheist.

04:18.298 --> 04:20.176
And not part of our family.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.750
Not yet.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.014
Besides, the number one problem
in the world is religion.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.600
That's why Mario and I aren't
gonna baptize the baby.

04:27.684 --> 04:31.145
Get dressed and get in the
car. Everyone's waiting.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.480
Why do I have to swear allegiance

04:32.563 --> 04:34.732
to something that comes out
of a fake country in Italy?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.861
- What happened to you?
- I almost died!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.864
And Olivia did and I just don't
believe if there's a God,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.548
He would let something like that happen.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.495
Okay, okay. You don't have to come.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.247
But I'll see you after for menudo.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.749
Probably not. I got to help Jamal out.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.669
Oh, no, you don't.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.672
If you can't hang with Jesus,
you can't hang with Jamal.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.216
Enjoy your day inside.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.387
I can't believe she's
gonna have my grandchild.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.599
I really like your mom.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.760 --> 05:23.800
Where did you sleep last night?

05:23.820 --> 05:25.199
Doesn't matter. I'm here.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.570
- Don't be a dick.
- Stop tussling and start hustling.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.041
You've got to be kidding
me. Ruby is bailing

05:33.124 --> 05:34.500
after he made us wait until morning?!

05:34.584 --> 05:36.336
He didn't make us wait.
We just didn't wanna die.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.171
Potato, potahto.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.922
Of course you'd take his side.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.592
Whatever. I'm finding my Luton.
My mom said it's in the blue bin.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.259
Here we are.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.304
Bingo, bitches. There it is.

05:51.934 --> 05:52.934
Which one?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.271
Seriously.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.273
- Have you talked to someone?
- About?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.276
Everything. That's a lot to hold on to.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.904
And I know sometimes it's hard
to open up to your family,

06:02.987 --> 06:04.655
but you can always open up to me.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.616
I took a semester of psych.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.454
I'm going to take a nap.

06:18.002 --> 06:21.089
You know, sleeping is
a sign of depression.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.800
You need to fight the depression
and express your feelings.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.400
So, how about we draw?

06:26.420 --> 06:27.512
What?

06:27.520 --> 06:30.056
Well, you said there's
nothing we can do.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.139
I disagree.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.602
What if MLK or Cesar Chavez
had that bad attitude?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.355
We need to make our voices heard.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.400
So... draw your feelings.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.196
What you got?

06:49.325 --> 06:50.701
That's amazing.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.662
How is that possibly amazing?

06:52.745 --> 06:55.581
Because you're angry, which
means you're past denial.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.793
Denial, stage one of grief.
Anger, stage two.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.086
You're making progress.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.969
It takes a big boy to
work through his trauma,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.340
- but you can't do it alone.
- Yes, I can.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.384
I do a lot of things alone.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.386
Some of my favorite things I do alone.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.847
You know you're the first
person I know who's been shot?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.181
And I hope you're the last.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.143
Ruby... change starts with us.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.853
#stoptheviolence,

07:17.145 --> 07:19.647
#guncontrol, and my personal fave,

07:19.730 --> 07:22.483
#myfuturebrotherinlawalmostdied
sostopshootingourbabies.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.403
Am I the baby in this scenario?
'Cause I thought I was the big boy.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.697
Honey... we're all the babies.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.909
Or rather... we are all...

07:35.204 --> 07:36.372
los bebes.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.056
- Where did you get that?
- Somebody just left it on the sidewalk.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.337
But your mom said not to leave.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.420
My mom also told Mario to use a condom.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.014
Ugh! It smells like my grandpa's
belly button in here.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.265
How do you know what that smells like?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.767
He used to pay me a quarter to clean it.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.420
Damn it. No bag. Retreat.

07:59.430 --> 08:00.440
Retreat stat!

08:02.315 --> 08:05.234
- What if it's not here?
- Relax. We still have four more to go.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.318
Relax?

08:07.403 --> 08:10.865
You're not the one spelunking
in that stanky funk.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.034
And let me ask you something, Mr. Relax.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.327
Where are my sneaks?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.162
Exactly.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.380
You're on sneaker duty.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.426
Ruby's on his way.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.136
Okay, boost me up double-stat.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.929
And this time, interlock your fingers,

08:34.940 --> 08:36.500
because I'm not feeling the dedication.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.250
Hey.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.769
Hey, I'm talking to you!

09:05.628 --> 09:06.963
What?

09:08.756 --> 09:10.216
Just wanted to check up on you.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.552
- You good?
- No, I'm not good!

09:12.635 --> 09:13.844
- Yo, chill out.
- Chill out?

09:14.178 --> 09:17.431
That's all you got as you sit there
on your damn throne? I got shot!

09:17.515 --> 09:19.725
And my friend, the most
amazing person I ever known,

09:19.809 --> 09:21.435
died because of you and for what?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.564
Nothing! Nothing but some bullshit
thief that means nothing!

09:24.647 --> 09:27.608
And that night won't stop playing
on auto repeat in my head,

09:27.692 --> 09:28.865
and every time I move my arm,

09:28.866 --> 09:30.611
which is often because
I'm a gesticulator,

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
it kills, further reminding
me of that night,

09:32.863 --> 09:35.074
thanks to you, so don't
tell me to chill out!

09:38.744 --> 09:40.329
You must be in the anger stage.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.918
Deeper. Deeper.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.002
And hold.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.587
Okay.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.424
Mm-hmm, I saw that.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.634
- Hmm? Saw what?
- You yawned.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.970
Monse, you're watching my sneaks, right?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.681
- I didn't yawn. I'm wide awake.
- You haven't slept, have you?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.516
They're limited edition.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.728
- Guys, are you holding tight?
- Yes!

10:03.811 --> 10:05.813
I feel like I'm slipping.
Interlock your fingers.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.649
So you came to lock my dad's
car, but not stay over?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.860
A few more inches. I think I...

10:11.193 --> 10:12.193
I see it!

10:12.695 --> 10:13.821
I see it!

10:13.904 --> 10:17.158
Okay, one more inch, and
keep a comfortable grip.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.035
Well, you look like shit. And
you don't smell great either.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.330
And yet I feel spectacular.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.910
♪ I got my Jetta ♪

10:24.081 --> 10:26.334
My pants!

10:26.417 --> 10:28.044
What the hell!

10:28.127 --> 10:29.920
Shit. Someone's coming. We got to hide.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.215
- Jamal, we'll be right back.
- No! No, no, don't leave me!

10:40.890 --> 10:41.890
What?

10:52.693 --> 10:53.693
Guys!

10:58.282 --> 11:00.493
I don't think I like cramped spaces.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.578
Cesar!

11:03.329 --> 11:04.330
Monse!

11:04.413 --> 11:05.915
Okay. Okay.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.002
Smell the flowers.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.921
Blow out the candles.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.964
Smell the flowers.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.843
Blow out the candles

11:20.388 --> 11:22.765
What was that?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.561
How did you get out so fast?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.772
A magician doesn't reveal his secrets,

11:29.855 --> 11:31.065
especially to traitors!

11:31.100 --> 11:32.160
We're sorry.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
Yeah, clearly not sorry enough.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.028
And clearly, you haven't
learned about abandonment,

11:36.112 --> 11:38.114
because you didn't watch
my back or my sneaks.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.407
You had one job!

11:39.490 --> 11:40.825
Technically, two.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.743
Okay, I'm looking for
results, not excuses.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's see it.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.663
You don't get to see my money!

11:45.746 --> 11:48.749
- You mean, our money?
- I'm the one who found it.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.917
And then you lost it.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.293
And we helped you find it again.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.046
It's not your money. Give it back!

11:55.548 --> 11:57.591
Fine. Then give me back my hoodie.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.764
- Hmm. Too bad. I want to see it.
- No!

12:03.848 --> 12:06.100
Give it! Let go!

12:06.183 --> 12:08.060
Give it. Give it back!

12:08.144 --> 12:10.104
- Geez, he's so strong.
- Ah! Ow!

12:10.187 --> 12:11.939
- Ow!
- Let go!

12:18.863 --> 12:20.406
How many times can I say I'm sorry?

12:20.480 --> 12:21.599
I know I stepped out of line,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.909
but I really don't have
time to be your valet.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.244
We need to grab a few nopales.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.246
We need a cart. This is getting heavy.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.791
- Do you ever not complain?
- Well, no one told you to bring me.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.211
So, what else don't you like about me?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.337
Nope.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.672
I'm not falling for that.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.424
It's not a debate.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.301
What else don't you like?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.220
Is this like queen-for-a-day sitch?

12:44.180 --> 12:47.016
It's a legal expression whereby
someone can say anything they want

12:47.099 --> 12:49.101
and their words can't
be used against them.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.019
Speak, queen.

12:51.850 --> 12:52.938
Well...

12:53.397 --> 12:55.401
you guys call yourself "the Santos,"

12:55.402 --> 12:57.318
the Saints, and yet you hurt people.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.070
- So what's the point of you, really?
- You coming at me?

13:00.571 --> 13:03.532
- But I didn't start this one.
- Yeah, said the complicit one.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.413
- You like history?
- World or American?

13:09.747 --> 13:10.747
Freeridge.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.958
Doesn't get more American than that.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.087
Back in the day the pinches
prophets terrorized Freeridge.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.548
Didn't matter who you were.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.300
Paletero trying to make a living.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.427
Viejita coming home from church.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.805
You were a target.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.807
They went to the cops.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.517
But you know how that goes.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.102
Until finally, Lil'
Ricky said, "No más."

13:32.686 --> 13:34.605
This neighborhood is his familia,

13:34.688 --> 13:36.357
and you don't mess with family.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.901
He started the Santos
to protect the hood.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.984
Great.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.696
So then you had two groups
terrorizing the neighborhood.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.035
Terrorizing?

13:53.415 --> 13:54.583
You mean, protecting.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.629
It's complicated.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.259
The Santos are a family.
Families are complicated.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.594
What do you know about family?
You threw your brother out.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.971
I said it's complicated!

14:09.390 --> 14:10.891
Cuchillos made that call.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.228
- And no one questions Cuchillos.
- Cuchillos can suck a dick!

14:18.983 --> 14:21.402
Look, all I'm saying is...

14:22.319 --> 14:24.947
if you're a saint, then save people.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.284
Don't kill them.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.003
- Hey.
- Hey. Where are you?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.005
- I'm on my way.
- Don't come.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.506
Cesar.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.757
I'll fill you in later.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.396
I've got a hangover.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.941
So before I get into this bag,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.153
I'm going to give you the opportunity

15:04.236 --> 15:06.071
to tell me what's in it.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.575
- I plead the Fifth.
- Really?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.078
Ma'am?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.086
- What's your name?
- Monse.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.797
Oh, Monse!

15:25.007 --> 15:26.634
Do you know the kid with no pants?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.134
I plead the Fifth.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.804
What are you doing?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.682
CYA, cover your ass, which is
something Jamal should've been doing

15:33.700 --> 15:35.790
- without my hoodie.
- So you do know him.

15:35.820 --> 15:36.830
Great.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.438
Jamal, get over here.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.400
I plead the Fifth, the
Eighth, and the Black.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.680
- The Black?
- Yeah.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.236
Everybody knows you guys have a quota.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.405
And I'm... I'm more than a number,

15:48.860 --> 15:50.750
a stat, a notch on your belt!

15:50.780 --> 15:52.380
Make sure you're getting all this, okay?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.041
You know, snitches don't get riches.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.794
You should've shown us the money.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.297
My, my, my!

16:05.381 --> 16:07.424
What do we have here?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.634
What are you doing here?

16:08.717 --> 16:10.317
Girl, stop playing. Like you don't know.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.058
The Explorer program. I'm third gen.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.727
Law enforcement is in my blood,
along with glitter and dreams.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.814
So let me guess, y'all want a
recommendation to join, right?

16:21.897 --> 16:25.275
- Yeah, you got us.
- Mmm. Am I detective material or what?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.070
- Can I ask you a question?
- Evidence.

16:28.153 --> 16:32.366
Apply to work in Evidence. Good
shit goes missing... all the time.

16:32.616 --> 16:36.036
So... is Officer Hamill a
good cop or a bad cop?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.205
He's a sad cop. With a temper.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.498
A sad cop?

16:39.581 --> 16:42.167
I can't get into it. I don't
wanna betray the shield.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.140
Off the record,

16:45.170 --> 16:47.673
homeboy was stepping out on
his girl Ellen, in Evidence,

16:47.756 --> 16:49.319
with Miss "He-put-a-ring-on-it" Ilene.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.420
So he's cheating on his wife?

16:50.467 --> 16:52.344
No, he was cheating on
his new ex-girlfriend

16:52.428 --> 16:53.554
with his old ex-wife.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.265
Jamal, you got to keep up if
you want to be an Explorer.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.101
Anyways, it's all good,
because Ellen is maguro,

16:59.180 --> 17:00.959
and the last thing she
needs is more drama

17:00.960 --> 17:02.563
from Señor Mad Moustache...

17:03.770 --> 17:05.020
... which is exactly

17:05.040 --> 17:07.358
why being an Explorer should
not be taken lightly!

17:07.443 --> 17:09.653
Because every time I wear this badge,

17:09.737 --> 17:12.990
I represent a legacy
of fine men and women,

17:13.574 --> 17:14.825
like Officer Hamill here.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.492
They're all yours.

17:19.954 --> 17:20.954
Okay.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.333
My patience is wearing thin.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.712
So I need to know right now

17:26.795 --> 17:28.380
what's in the goddamn bag?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.464
Okay, okay, okay.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.716
I'll tell you.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.721
Is $200,000. It's the
RollerWorld loot. I found it.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.682
No one thought I could, but I did.
Now I'm here, wish I wasn't.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.686
Kid... if you keep BSing me,

17:42.770 --> 17:45.105
I will make that quota.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.358
I'm trying to do you a favor.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.277
Now, what's in the bag?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.380
Officer, what's with all the hostility?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.000
You look like you're
about to pop a vein.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.366
I do?

17:58.744 --> 17:59.744
Shit!

18:00.412 --> 18:01.705
Give me a minute.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.376
I'm working through some issues.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.837
Hell, this is getting good.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.757
We get it. You have a hard job to do.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.801
But, honestly, you don't need to
give yourself a heart attack.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.012
For the sake of your family, please,
don't take that anger home.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.139
That's what Ellen says...

18:20.015 --> 18:22.017
when she's not riding
me about something.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.435
I know the feeling.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.022
Maybe she's riding you
because she cares about you.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.941
And maybe you should
appreciate her concern.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.024
I do.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.985
I do appreciate it.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.321
- I just feel...
- Smothered?

18:34.404 --> 18:37.574
Totally. She wants me to move in,

18:37.658 --> 18:39.243
but I'm not ready.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.328
And that's why I snapped at her.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.873
I don't know.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.210
All I'm trying to do
is figure my shit out.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.338
Maybe if you let her in a bit
more, she'd let you do that.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.133
That's what my ex-wife said.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.343
- Ellen.
- No. Ilene.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.637
Still, there's something that's...

18:59.388 --> 19:00.764
holding me back.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.800
What?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.145
What is it?

19:08.772 --> 19:09.940
Money.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.441
Are you going to keep it?

19:12.609 --> 19:15.737
I wish, but it's California
and she gets half.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.616
My divorce cost me a fortune...

19:19.700 --> 19:22.452
which is why I'm scared
to totally commit.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.415
I don't want it to happen again.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.793
How could I miss what was
right in front of me?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.378
Just, uh... Hey, listen.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.256
Um, remember last year when you
helped me out with my shit?

19:34.339 --> 19:35.924
Let me help you out this time.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.677
You need to go to her. Now.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.680
- Now?
- If not now, when?

19:41.763 --> 19:42.806
If not you, who?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.141
Don't walk, run!

19:44.224 --> 19:46.476
Show her you're the man
she knows you can be!

20:05.078 --> 20:06.288
Learn how to cut a lime.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.665
You cut like a serial killer.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.021
Good.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.358
You're excused.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.693
I'm excused?

20:38.695 --> 20:39.695
Yup.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.241
I listened, you listened.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.158
We're good.

20:44.993 --> 20:45.993
You can go.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.204
Uh...

20:49.831 --> 20:50.831
Okay.

20:52.876 --> 20:53.876
Or you could stay.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.509
Mmm. Taste it.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.020
Mmm.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.595
Expand your palate, homie.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.931
Hmm-mm.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.403
Damn. Get off me already.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.570
It's my mom.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.430
She was on me about going to church,

21:22.440 --> 21:23.820
on me about hanging out with my friends.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.701
Now she's blowing me up
wondering where I am.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.200
Now can I just be left alone already?

21:27.210 --> 21:28.470
Pressures of the privileged.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.372
Privileged?

21:30.831 --> 21:32.416
I live in a house with
bars on the window.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.544
With two parents inside and a
college future waiting outside.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.937
Don't whine to me about your mom.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.589
No one took care of me and Cesar
when my mom was out there.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.758
- I didn't mean to...
- Be ungrateful?

21:42.340 --> 21:43.540
I get that you got shot.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.595
But why do you think no one
came to finish the job?

21:45.679 --> 21:46.680
Because of me!

21:46.763 --> 21:48.724
And think about how fast
that truce happened.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.807
Me, again.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.101
I'm sorry.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.340
I didn't know.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.896
There's a lot of things you don't know.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.482
Like what it's like to walk into
a job interview with a record.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.568
You think Walmart's gonna hire
someone with two strikes?

21:59.651 --> 22:00.819
See, I wouldn't work there.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.947
- They have poor employee satisfaction.
- Are you joking?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.115
This shit's real!

22:05.198 --> 22:07.284
That's the kind of stuff
that makes a man snap!

22:10.162 --> 22:12.205
But being mad at the
world won't help you.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.334
It'll only hurt you.

22:17.780 --> 22:18.890
Okay.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.298
I've had adequate time to calm down,

22:21.381 --> 22:22.632
done some reflecting,

22:22.716 --> 22:25.469
meditated my BP down to 110 / 77.

22:29.931 --> 22:30.974
So you can see it now.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.058
Your money?

22:33.226 --> 22:34.519
Our money.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.481
Look, who am I kidding?

22:37.564 --> 22:40.734
This is a whole lot of money and
a whole lot of responsibility.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.362
I need to figure out what to do
with it, and I need your help.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.738
So what do you say?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.199
Can we see it?

22:55.874 --> 22:56.874
Oh, my God.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.253
All right. I'm going
to be late for dinner.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.464
- Catch you guys later?
- Yeah.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.091
Yeah.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.765
Okay. Good night.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.766
Wait, that's it?

23:16.800 --> 23:17.850
Sleep well.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.149
Whoa! Aren't you worried about
where I'm going to sleep?

23:21.817 --> 23:23.985
If you're not worried,
then I'm not worried.

23:26.863 --> 23:27.863
Ah!

23:45.382 --> 23:46.382
Coach.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.719
- You're here to recruit me?
- No.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.472
Jamal, take a seat.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.568
There's some footage
we need to talk about.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.613
How do you know?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.031
That's why I'm here.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.033
Because you teach sex ed?

24:12.350 --> 24:13.410
No.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.830
It's because I love
your dad and your mom.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.374
We've been a team since high school.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.462
Okay, please tell me you guys
aren't coming out as a throuple.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.380
I don't know what that is,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.841
but what I do know is
when I saw the holes...

24:29.009 --> 24:31.928
- There's more than one?
- Oh, don't act like you don't know.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.974
And I thought about the embarrassment
your parents would feel.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.895
The pain your mom must be going through.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.146
Are you still in pain?

24:41.229 --> 24:44.357
Yes, it hurts deep inside.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.984
Okay, can we just drop this?

24:46.067 --> 24:49.779
We'll drop it as soon as you
take a look at these pictures.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.574
No!

24:56.244 --> 24:59.122
Oh! Oh! The football field.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.959
Wait. Oh, shit.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.043
Boy!

25:04.794 --> 25:07.130
What the hell on Earth
were you digging up?

25:07.672 --> 25:10.800
Oh, that's really bad!

25:11.343 --> 25:14.387
You shouldn't use a sponge.
It's a bacteria playground.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.806
Or not.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.980
I'm sorry I left the house today.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.274
I'm sorry I told you that you couldn't.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.694
You're entitled to believe
whatever you wanna believe.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.406
I'm just not feeling
God these days, Mom.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.412
That's okay.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.708
When I was your age, I wasn't
feeling Him much, either.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.711
I used to fake migraines
and stomach aches

25:46.795 --> 25:49.923
and even a scorpion bite just
to get out of going to church.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.176
- Did it work?
- All the time!

25:54.302 --> 25:55.720
So what changed?

25:58.723 --> 26:00.100
I had kids.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.396
I don't know how else to explain it.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.858
Children are nothing short of a miracle.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.280
And when you see them take
their first breath...

26:16.324 --> 26:18.243
or potentially their last...

26:21.246 --> 26:24.124
Well, you don't question
if there's a god.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.668
You know there is.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.296
Listen.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.966
Do your mama a favor.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.760
Let me hold you?

26:41.766 --> 26:42.766
Baby...

26:43.310 --> 26:45.770
I don't care what you think about God.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.607
But you better believe this:

26:49.941 --> 26:53.528
no matter how much we
argue or disagree...

26:54.696 --> 26:57.824
I will love you till the day that I die.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.200
Me too.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.496
Just don't do it before me, okay?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.666
I just want you to be happy.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.669
I'm working on it.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.556
If children are such miracles,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.892
you might wanna be less
transparent with Amber.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.146
If you could fake a scorpion
bite, you could fake a smile.
