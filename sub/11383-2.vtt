about them.

a prime number.
Yes.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.468
It's okay.
No, we do.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.547
Room 607 is
a private residence,
it's not available.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.132
We don't need 607.
210 is what I got.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.637
210's fine.
We're okay...

15:36.770 --> 15:37.930
Okay.
No, maybe we'll
speak to the manager...

15:37.979 --> 15:39.810
210 is fine. Thank you.
Because we need
a prime number.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.434
210 is fine.
Elevator's over there.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.815
I'd double bag
it with that one.

This isn't right.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.904

did you give them?

15:50.242 --> 15:51.231
210.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.074
Come on.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.457
No. This isn't right.

Jones, it's James.

16:11.596 --> 16:12.585

16:12.681 --> 16:14.012
I thought we
agreed that you were

16:14.141 --> 16:15.597
not to contact me
again in this time?

16:15.684 --> 16:18.346
We did, we did,
but things have changed.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.803
An event
altering your time/ine?
Yeah.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.687
Why?
JAMES: Because
it got complicated.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.272

16:34.911 --> 16:36.993
You have a purpose, Jennifer.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.538
There is nothing more
important than this.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.368
I need you to write
a note in yourjournal.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.746

come back and get me.

was made to protect
the integrity of our timeline!

You're gonna make a mistake,
you're gonna hurt someone,
a friend...

17:01.021 --> 17:02.386
I cannot know these things.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.480
It's the Emerson Hotel.
Remember to come
back and get me.

17:05.567 --> 17:06.682
Very well. You told me.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.229
So, you’re still there?
Yeah.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.986
Well,
then that's either because
I am unable to bring you back,

17:12.073 --> 17:13.529
or I'm choosing not to.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.029
Either way,
if my understanding
of causality is correct,

17:16.119 --> 17:18.280
I have 27 years to decide.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.449
So please,
do not call me back.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.038
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't... Don't hang up!

17:22.709 --> 17:25.746
OLIVIA: This is your purpose,
Jennifer.
Purpose? You have no purpose.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.665
Without it, you have nothing.
Not anymore.

when we would go out
and raid survivor camps

18:13.468 --> 18:15.299
and you would get all judgy?

18:15.804 --> 18:20.969
Right? And you would
call me thief
and tyrant and killer.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.162
Back in 2013.

19:31.713 --> 19:36.002
Heard a man and woman
fighting inside in the house.

He chases her out
and grabs her hair.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.095

Two little boys run out,

he would've gone all the way.

No, my timeline
changed into this one.

Right.

And much worse
than we remembered it?
Precisely.

But there were
other changes as well.
At least from my perspective.

we invaded,

and used it to
continue our mission.

29:24.639 --> 29:27.176
Starts here.
This place...
I've seen it.

29:27.975 --> 29:28.964
Primaries.

29:29.810 --> 29:30.799
It's all in my head.

29:31.312 --> 29:34.145
Pieces, pictures, places...
You...

29:35.983 --> 29:36.972
And her...

29:38.819 --> 29:42.277
Why do I always
have to do bad things
to get your attention?

29:45.660 --> 29:46.945
Why did you do that?

29:48.663 --> 29:50.494
I have nothing left.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.330
Of course you do.

29:56.003 --> 30:00.997
Listen,
you need to forget about
your mother and your father,

30:01.676 --> 30:03.758
whatever the hell
the Twelve Monkeys told you.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.630
You're not
supposed to kill billions.

30:07.515 --> 30:13.181
Look,I”
I don't know what
your purpose is, okay?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.303
I don't even
know what mine is.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.690
But there is
something that you have to do.

30:23.823 --> 30:24.983
Leave.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.820
Just go. Get out of this.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.202
Go and find your purpose.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.039
You do have one.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.325
One that's right.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.537
Just go.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.997
Leave all this behind.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.547
Okay.

30:49.265 --> 30:50.254
(SNIFFLES)

30:54.270 --> 30:55.259
(DOOR CLOSES)

31:01.068 --> 31:02.524
You here to
shoot me again?

31:03.404 --> 31:04.393
No.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.896
I don't know
anything about them.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.607
I never did.

31:10.911 --> 31:14.904
I helped them find
the virus, that was it.

31:16.584 --> 31:19.667
So you can torture me,
or whatever...

31:19.754 --> 31:21.961
What about your son, Ramse?

31:28.596 --> 31:31.212
2044 made you that hard,
Cass?

31:43.778 --> 31:48.738
Sam, is that you, buddy?

32:04.590 --> 32:07.627
Hey, Whit? Whit!

32:08.135 --> 32:09.215
The Messengers.

32:09.303 --> 32:10.383
I don't know anything.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.460
Where did they go?

32:11.597 --> 32:14.430
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.181
Don't hurt him.

32:17.645 --> 32:18.805
Kill me.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.979
(ALARM BLARING)

32:27.196 --> 32:30.359
Cass? Cass!
Don't hurt him!

32:33.119 --> 32:35.326
Mr. Deacon,
we had a deal.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.243
I thought your people
had this place secured?

33:17.037 --> 33:18.163
Do you know
who we are?

33:19.206 --> 33:22.369
You call
yourselves the Daughters.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.784
Where is James Cole?

33:25.546 --> 33:28.504
Gone.
And why has he
not been returned?

33:28.841 --> 33:31.298
Mr. Cole is no longer
part of the mission.

33:32.136 --> 33:34.297
There is no
reason to return him.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.129
We will not leave here
until James Cole is returned.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.382
You have until dawn.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.473
The Emerson Hotel,
Suite 607.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.730
Today he called you,
and you refused to help.

33:47.151 --> 33:50.894
Why do
the Daughters care about
the fate of James Cole?

33:51.739 --> 33:53.570
James Cole
understands something
you all have forgotten.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.314
James Cole
understands something
you all have forgotten.

33:55.826 --> 33:59.535
Our fates are intertwined,
here and in the past.

34:00.331 --> 34:01.912
Our Mother
knows this.

34:02.750 --> 34:07.244
Many cycles ago,
James Cole made a choice.
An act of mercy.

34:08.839 --> 34:12.502
For that, a debt was issued.
And now that debt
has been repaid.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.764

35:48.188 --> 35:50.679
Welcome back,
Mr. Cole.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.520
Just like old times.

35:58.282 --> 35:59.488
Just like old times.

36:02.286 --> 36:03.446
Sam is here.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.870
Cassie threatened
to hurt him.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.120
She wouldn't do that.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.705
You don't know her
anymore.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.953
Everything's changed now.

36:17.551 --> 36:18.882
Everything.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.307
Let's go for a walk.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.639
When this mission began,
you and Iwere
both at a crossroads.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.145
Neither sure if
the other could be trusted.

36:35.235 --> 36:36.566
And you've always
known more than me,

36:36.695 --> 36:38.651
and you've always
held back.

36:38.739 --> 36:42.231
You knew I'd
get stuck in 2015.
So much for trust.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.910
At any moment,
what you did in the past
could have changed everything.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.698
Nothing was certain.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.661
And this shift in our
timeline is the proof.

36:52.503 --> 36:56.917
Stopping Jennifer Goines
and destroying
the virus changed history.

36:57.174 --> 37:00.337
We pushed back the plague.
We delayed it.

37:01.011 --> 37:03.423
We hurt them, Mr. Cole.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.172
Maybe, a little.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.763
Cassie still
sends the message.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.057
She still dies,
only now,
a few years later.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.101
Along with
billions of other people.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.682
I wouldn't call
that a victory.

37:17.611 --> 37:21.354
(MUSIC PLAYING)

37:21.448 --> 37:22.437
What is that?

37:23.742 --> 37:27.109
Music, James.
And more to the point...

37:29.289 --> 37:30.699
It's a broadcast.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.201
Shortwave.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.374
From somewhere out there.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.588
What you and Dr. Railly did
in 2016 changed things.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.289
Here.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.462
Our records show

37:44.263 --> 37:45.878
that some of
the quarantine zones

37:45.973 --> 37:47.634
didn't fall as
quickly as before.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.302
So there were
more survivors.

37:50.269 --> 37:54.308
Human lives spared
because we dared
to challenge fate.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.935
Do you know
what that is?

37:58.402 --> 38:00.768
It's hope, Mr. Cole.

38:09.788 --> 38:14.498
This machine, this power...
No matter what we achieve,

38:15.169 --> 38:17.330
we must always operate
under the assumption

38:17.421 --> 38:18.831
that we're
dealing with an enemy

38:18.922 --> 38:20.833
whose capabilities
are equal to our own.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.131
Messengers.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.843
We don't know
where they went.

38:27.431 --> 38:29.843
Or when.
Not even a year.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.970
We had hoped Mr.
Ramse could tell us.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.021
He doesn't know.

38:36.607 --> 38:40.850
Katarina,
we made mistakes.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.143
All of us.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.613
James, I need to know.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.995
Are you still with me?

38:59.963 --> 39:01.373
I'm still with you.

39:13.227 --> 39:15.183

39:16.980 --> 39:18.891
That's where I think
the Messengers went.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.654
Don't worry, Kat,
I'm going.

39:35.916 --> 39:38.874
I'm just
gathering up my things.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.412
(SIGHS)

39:43.590 --> 39:45.501
You know,
the most fun I ever had

39:45.592 --> 39:47.423
was breaking
down all the walls

39:47.553 --> 39:49.214
you built around yourself.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.261
And now I get to do it
allover again.

39:57.938 --> 39:58.927
Good night.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.620
Hey.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.293
Hey.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.298
So much is different.

40:27.384 --> 40:28.874
Yeah, I can see that.

40:30.095 --> 40:34.805
Inoﬂced
everybody's real cozy
with Deacon now.

40:44.067 --> 40:49.061
I'm really not sure
how all this is gonna
work now that you're here,

40:49.156 --> 40:51.488
and not back in 2016.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.322
We have a mission
to finish.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.576
We do.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.074
The only way that's happening

41:02.169 --> 41:04.660
is ifyou're willing to do
what needs to be done.

41:05.505 --> 41:06.585
Like before.

41:10.135 --> 41:14.970
Look, I know your
being this way
is my fault,

41:16.058 --> 41:17.639
but this isn't
who you are.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.801
What I am is because of me.

41:21.730 --> 41:22.970
Nobody else.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.849
Everyone and
everything changes, Cole.

41:26.943 --> 41:27.932
I know that.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.736
I was sent back in
time to kill a man.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.774
It was supposed to fix
everything. It didn't.

41:35.369 --> 41:38.406
So I killed more people,
nothing changed.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.164
And then I saved someone.

41:44.878 --> 41:46.994
Someone who
should have died.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.923
And that...

41:50.133 --> 41:53.250
That is what
changed things.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.006
It's the only thing
that's ever made
any difference.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.642
As for the mission,

42:13.740 --> 42:15.276
I'm ready
when you are.
