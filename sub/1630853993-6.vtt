00:02.000 --> 00:06.280
This programme contains
very strong language and
some violent scenes from the start

00:06.280 --> 00:08.680
Correction is a method of real-time
image manipulation using the

00:08.680 --> 00:11.440
deployment of deepfake technology.
They kill people to protect it.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.840
It's Yvonne, isn't it?
If there's anything I can do.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.800
You can get the bastard who did it.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.400
Thanks to the intervention
of our US partners,

00:18.400 --> 00:20.280
Operation Vanguard is secure.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.720
I stopped by the Commissioner's
office this morning,

00:22.720 --> 00:23.800
handed in my 728.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.760
You're resigning?
Don't worry, Gemma.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.320
I didn't give the real reason.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.720
Isaac, the deal is still intact.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.760
What deal?

00:31.720 --> 00:34.360
Somebody got to you, didn't they?

00:34.360 --> 00:38.000
And with power, you can do all the
good you ever dreamt of.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.360
I was with Isaac Turner.
He doesn't trust us.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.640
And that is your fault.
Lower your tone.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.200
I don't let anyone raise their voice
at me off camera.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.440
What am I looking at?

00:50.440 --> 00:52.720
Stage 4 stomach cancer.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.960
Hello?
I need you to do something for me.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.280
Look in the bathroom.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.720
There's a laptop.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.960
Gregory Knox, I am arresting you
for obstructing a police officer.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.920
What are you saying?

01:03.920 --> 01:05.560
You in?

01:05.560 --> 01:06.600
Yes.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.120
OVER COMMS: Shots fired.
Threat neutralised.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.640
Target down. Repeat. Target down.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.840
Everything's falling perfectly
into place.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.920
DOOR WHIRS

SIGNAL STATIC

02:10.280 --> 02:13.320
ON SPEAKER: Also present was
Commander Hart and DSU Garland,

02:13.320 --> 02:16.520
who stated there are up to 50
operatives across...

02:16.520 --> 02:18.640
GLITCH IN SOUND

02:16.520 --> 02:18.640
..GCHQ. Also present...

02:18.640 --> 02:21.160
SOUND REVERBERATES

02:18.640 --> 02:21.160
..was the Security Minister,

02:21.160 --> 02:23.520
Isaac Turner.
This is DCI Rachel Carey.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.840
In place of hidden camera recording,

02:25.840 --> 02:29.200
I'm filming this eyewitness
testimony for my dossier detailing

02:29.200 --> 02:33.360
the systematic illegal practice
of video evidence tampering

02:33.360 --> 02:35.280
known as corrections.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.200
THEY SNIFFLE

02:42.760 --> 02:45.000
Let me ask you something.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.000
THEY GASP

02:45.000 --> 02:46.880
THEY BREATHE JAGGEDLY

02:46.880 --> 02:53.080
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

02:53.080 --> 02:55.240
You think a person can change?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.200
I don't know if I do.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.520
You told us you could change.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.240
My British chums went for it.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.320
Danny Hart, thinking with his famous
hard-on.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.040
Garland.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.000
God only knows what she was
thinking of.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.520
Me, I told them...

03:23.520 --> 03:25.680
..I'll believe it when I see it.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.640
As for you, fast track.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.800
Boy, you better pray
a person can change.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.160
BRIEFCASE SLAMS

03:37.720 --> 03:41.320
The only hope you have of getting
out of here alive depends on it.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.400
PHONE VIBRATES

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Hello?
Sorry for the unsociable hour.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.680
The empire's struck back.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.680
Gill, the Home Sec
that just won't die.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.440
We need to regroup. Respond.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.000
The car's on its way.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.040
Erm...OK.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.680
I mean, you heard the recording,
right?

05:07.680 --> 05:11.120
I have got him admitting he
colluded with Aliza to obstruct

05:11.120 --> 05:13.600
Victoria Bello's application.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.000
And for that,
I salute you, Isaac.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.960
But that alone is not a strategy.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.360
It's time to launch
Operation Kill Gill.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.400
I'll bring pastries. Any allergies?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.200
Any...?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.720
No. Erm...

05:27.720 --> 05:30.800
..Gregory, is...is this safe?

05:32.320 --> 05:35.560
I mean, us talking on the phone
like this.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.320
So long as it's me you're talking
to, Isaac, you're safe.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.160
LINE GOES DEAD

05:49.960 --> 05:51.640
SHE BREATHES RAGGEDLY

06:04.800 --> 06:06.240
SHE GASPS

06:12.240 --> 06:13.880
Face the camera.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.920
Read the highlighted paragraph.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.680
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

06:19.960 --> 06:21.480
Aloud.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.640
QUIETLY: I...Rachel Carey...

06:30.200 --> 06:33.680
..understand...
Oh, Colonel Kurtz. I said aloud.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.280
LOUDER: I, Rachel Carey,

06:43.280 --> 06:47.080
understand that I am currently
within the legal jurisdiction

06:47.080 --> 06:49.880
of the United States of America.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.000
Whilst I remain
within the legal jurisdiction

06:57.000 --> 06:59.560
of the United States of America,

06:59.560 --> 07:03.720
I am bound by the rules, regulations

07:03.720 --> 07:07.640
and limitations of US federal law.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.520
Strange -
expecting others to obey your laws

07:20.520 --> 07:22.400
while you break
every last one of ours.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.640
Settle down, wildcat.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.760
You've already got one battle scar.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.360
Why did you withhold this critical
piece of intelligence?

07:37.360 --> 07:39.760
Russian state assassin
captured on camera.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.200
You didn't share it?
I'm not talking without a lawyer.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.560
You're not under arrest.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.040
Garland, then.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.720
Beg your pardon?

07:53.920 --> 07:57.320
I want DSU Gemma Garland
present at my interrogation.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.120
I'm guessing she's in on this, too.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.480
Right?

08:09.320 --> 08:11.040
Sorry, kiddo.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.760
Momma's not home.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.600
Why don't you tell me exactly
how you got a hold of this image.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.760
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.720
I'd like to put a soaking cloth
over your face between questions.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.520
But...I'm exercising restraint.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.240
Gregory Knox shared this with you,
didn't he?

08:35.240 --> 08:38.320
I strongly suggest
you exercise some yourself.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.480
But you already knew who the man
behind the mask was.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.600
Nikolai Mirsky,
if that's his name.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.880
Remember when we talked
about change?

08:46.880 --> 08:49.920
He's not a Russian national, is he?
Now would be a good time to start.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.600
I'm going to say he worked for you

08:53.600 --> 08:55.440
until he became a liability,

08:55.440 --> 08:57.600
and you had his partner
blow his brains out.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.760
I mean...I try to do the right
thing.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.000
I don't know what you're plotting
with Gregory Knox,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.600
but I do hope it's worth it.
And for what? A lot of people seem

09:05.600 --> 09:08.440
to be dying in the process.
An entitled fast-track princess...

09:08.440 --> 09:11.960
Edison Yao. Joseph Mwangi.
..yap-yap-yapping... Jason McKenna.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.120
..in my ear... Lee Bradbury.
..doesn't know when...

09:14.120 --> 09:16.120
Patrick Flynn.
..to shut the fuck up!

09:19.040 --> 09:20.600
Your boy had shitty luck.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.400
Saw something he shouldn't.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.680
It happens.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.720
But you, on the other hand - nah,
you got all the luck in the world,

09:28.720 --> 09:29.960
don't you?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.760
Wearing a wire,
catching my boy on camera.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.360
You should be lying in the morgue
right next to him.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.280
You would be, too, if it wasn't
for your fucking guardian angels.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.840
SHE GASPS

09:41.840 --> 09:42.960
Frank.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.360
SHE CHOKES AND COUGHS

10:02.440 --> 10:05.760
Operation Kill Gill, phase two.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.840
We need to put Isaac Turner in
front of his biggest audience yet.

10:08.840 --> 10:12.720
Take down the Home Secretary
with the whole country watching.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.720
Every public denial
this doofus makes,

10:15.720 --> 10:17.720
the story grows bigger.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.880
Meanwhile, Isaac Turner is simply
trying to get on

10:20.880 --> 10:22.680
with his important new schedule -

10:22.680 --> 10:27.400
promoting business schemes, opening
war memorials. Sports initiatives?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.120
Yes.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.360
But those pesky reporters
won't stop badgering him

10:32.360 --> 10:34.000
about Rowan Gill.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.160
In the public interest, you agree
to an exclusive interview.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.640
Look, I...I don't want, you know,
to seem like I'm out for revenge.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.080
I knew you'd get it.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.520
Approximately one hour ago,

10:57.520 --> 11:01.040
I was present at a briefing
with Home Secretary Rowan Gill,

11:01.040 --> 11:02.840
who I learned has full knowledge

11:02.840 --> 11:05.560
of Correction and its use
within the UK.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.040
Also present was Commander Hart
and DSU Garland.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.760
It appears somebody recently tried
to wipe it all from your computer.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.880
The laptop hidden in your bathroom?

11:16.880 --> 11:20.600
But hadn't quite managed to
delete it from the deleted folder.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.680
Rookie mistake. Fucking Abigail.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.600
I must say,
I found it rather sweet...

11:26.760 --> 11:28.200
..your little journal.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.600
Not quite Edward Snowden.
More...Adrian Mole.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.440
And then I reminded myself
that naivety and treachery

11:40.440 --> 11:42.400
are not mutually exclusive.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.840
Who else is involved...

11:49.040 --> 11:51.040
..in your plot?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.680
Guv. Yeah.

12:03.680 --> 12:08.240
I think the SO-15 contingent
is seriously overdue a briefing.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.600
I sent three armed units off to
the suspect vehicle last night.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.640
Ten minutes later, we get "shots
fired" over comms and "target down".

12:16.640 --> 12:18.440
And? Between all three units,

12:18.440 --> 12:20.920
not one firearms officer
claimed the kill.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.960
You're questioning the comms
traffic? I'm questioning everything,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.720
after recent events.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.160
Did we take down a suspect? Yes.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.720
Is there a body? There usually is
when someone's killed.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.560
There was a lot of confusion
in the vicinity, by all accounts.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.000
There was a lot of confusion
in the control room, guv.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.600
Disappearing vehicles -
sound familiar?

12:42.360 --> 12:45.680
A major event in Operation Vanguard

12:45.680 --> 12:48.640
and not one of us had eyes on.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.480
A bit of reassurance
wouldn't go amiss

12:51.480 --> 12:53.520
from someone we can trust.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.320
VIDEO: Welcome to the nightmare
that is Correction, Isaac.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.320
Our enemies fake things
which we can't deny.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.320
There's a lot of information
on this video file,

13:11.320 --> 13:14.240
and I don't mean
from Rowan Gill.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.760
The resolution suggests the type of
camera used more by journalists

13:17.760 --> 13:19.200
than police.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.600
So I ask you again...

13:21.840 --> 13:23.400
..who else is involved?

13:25.280 --> 13:26.880
Khadija Khan?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.360
It's over, Rachel.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.080
We have everything from your first
transgression to your most recent.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.040
Not forgetting...

13:44.360 --> 13:46.000
..this little gem.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.960
VIDEO: Patrick wasn't meant
to be a target, though, was he?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.920
After everything we've done for
you, this is how you repay us.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.600
And it wouldn't be
the first time

13:54.600 --> 13:56.640
you failed to stop it!
That is enough!

13:56.640 --> 13:58.840
Hannah Roberts was an enemy
of the British state.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.320
VIDEO STOPS

14:02.240 --> 14:04.120
What did you expect?

14:06.400 --> 14:10.240
You monitor me in my home.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.960
I beg your pardon? Cameras in every
room, watching me day and night.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.320
Naturally, I can neither

14:15.320 --> 14:17.480
confirm or deny any such operation.
In my bedroom!

14:17.480 --> 14:19.680
If you were under surveillance...
Watching me in bed!

14:19.680 --> 14:22.080
..it's turned out to be
entirely justified. I can't sleep!

14:22.080 --> 14:25.560
You secretly recorded British
intelligence. I needed insurance!

14:25.560 --> 14:26.720
Oh!

14:28.240 --> 14:31.480
What a crushing disappointment
you are, Rachel.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.920
After all the chances
you've been given.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.760
You kept me in the dark from the
moment I joined the department,

14:38.760 --> 14:40.160
banishing me to Mapping...

14:40.160 --> 14:43.080
What is it about your generation...
..keeping me under surveillance.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.760
..that causes you to melt at the
denial of instant gratification?

14:45.760 --> 14:49.400
You were serving a penance. You were
supposed to be earning our trust.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.400
I was impressed with you.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.160
You saw this was
all Frank Napier's doing.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.520
Before me.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.160
Before any of us.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.080
You even managed to get the man
to blurt out his culpability

15:10.080 --> 15:11.560
right in front of you,

15:11.560 --> 15:14.680
even if it did mean
nearly getting your throat slit.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.160
You're not bad, Rachel.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.960
You've got the capacity
for the work, all right.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.040
And you want to squander it all...

15:23.720 --> 15:26.160
..so you can be
some whistle-blower?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.800
And then what?

15:29.800 --> 15:33.040
Go into hiding, take refuge
in Russia for the rest of your life?

15:33.040 --> 15:35.320
There were opportunities for you.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.720
Still would be.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.480
I mean, if I felt for a second
I could trust you.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.120
What does that mean?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.640
Danny Hart's handed in his notice.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.120
SO-15 will need a new commander.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.720
The new commander of SO-15...

16:03.600 --> 16:04.760
..me?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.880
No. What?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.040
Me.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.120
Oh.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.840
But if I were to step
into Danny Hart's shoes,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.600
I'd need someone
to step into mine.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.040
You expect me to believe,
after all this,

16:17.040 --> 16:18.680
you'd want me on your team?

16:20.720 --> 16:24.360
I should have known
you'd fail to understand.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.080
Well, forgive me, but I like my work
a little less tainted

16:28.080 --> 16:31.080
with murder and corruption.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.880
Perhaps you're concussed.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.440
You, Frank Napier, Gregory Knox -

16:35.440 --> 16:38.400
I'm guessing you're all
in on this together.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.160
Gregory Knox

16:40.160 --> 16:42.320
is a scourge on human society.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.960
He's everything that's wrong
with power, politics and technology

16:45.960 --> 16:47.080
in the world today.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.200
Then why are you protecting him?

16:49.200 --> 16:52.320
You told me that I would see
Correction used as a force for good.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.240
I've seen it used to help
people like Napier and Knox.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.440
I was as appalled as you to discover
Frank was involved in this.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.360
But there's a difference
between the aims of an operation

17:01.360 --> 17:02.560
and the running of it.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.240
Whatever it is, it makes
you complicit in the murders

17:05.240 --> 17:07.120
of five innocent people...

17:07.120 --> 17:09.640
I would never sanction the killing
of a British national.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.120
..complicit in the cover-up...

17:11.120 --> 17:12.760
The two things are not the same!

17:12.760 --> 17:14.760
Explain the difference to a judge.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.240
You really want to know?

17:16.240 --> 17:18.640
My intervention into this shitstorm

17:18.640 --> 17:21.880
prevented British killings -
specifically...

17:21.880 --> 17:23.200
..yours.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.600
Don't do it!

17:41.720 --> 17:43.280
Everything all right?

17:44.520 --> 17:48.440
You don't seem on the precipice
of a new dawn.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.800
You have it?

17:59.880 --> 18:02.320
Were you expecting a big suitcase?
It's locked.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.680
Needs a code. And you shall have it
upon completion of your work.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.080
Brains on your flooring
is not complete enough for you?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.120
That isn't funny, Frank.
I've had nightmares.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.880
I thought you were coming
to deal with her,

18:11.880 --> 18:14.920
not settle your internal affairs in
my corridor. They're cleaning it up!

18:14.920 --> 18:17.120
I've got journos sniffing
around the building,

18:17.120 --> 18:18.640
and not the kind I like.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.040
Rumours of another
armed attack in London.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.120
The story needs wrapping up.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.040
No loose threads.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.280
Well...

18:35.320 --> 18:37.520
Again, I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.080
Consider this the sort of thing
you might learn from me

18:42.080 --> 18:44.800
if you could bear to give me
your trust, instead of constantly

18:44.800 --> 18:46.720
trying to betray me.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.920
When the police uncover
a conspiracy, they make arrests.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.440
A spy...

18:54.440 --> 18:55.800
..flips it.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.440
Keeps it running to their advantage.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.320
I confirmed Frank Napier's
involvement in this

19:03.320 --> 19:04.680
not 36 hours ago...

19:05.920 --> 19:08.560
..when he came to me
in a sharing mood.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.360
His gunmen were outside your flat,

19:13.360 --> 19:14.840
waiting for his order.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.560
You caught one of them on camera,

19:16.560 --> 19:20.240
of course you were going to be next
on Frank Napier's kill list.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.360
Until you stopped him.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.760
Until I persuaded him

19:29.760 --> 19:31.800
to let me take the reins.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.280
How did...?

19:36.280 --> 19:39.760
Let's just say I mediated
a crisis of moral leadership.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.840
So...

19:46.320 --> 19:49.640
..I'm sorry if you disapprove
of my joining the operation.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.160
But if I hadn't...

19:56.040 --> 19:59.560
The door to this opportunity
will not stay open long, Rachel.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.040
I suggest you take advantage
before it shuts.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.760
Give me everything you have

20:04.760 --> 20:05.800
on Correction,

20:05.800 --> 20:08.320
tell me who you're working with...

20:08.320 --> 20:10.520
..and we'll find a way to move on.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.000
And if I don't?

20:19.640 --> 20:20.720
SHE SIGHS

20:21.960 --> 20:23.960
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.040
I thought you might ask that.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.600
Phillips.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.960
I'd brace yourself for this,
if I were you.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.040
Simone Turner is at Security.
Why?

20:47.040 --> 20:50.240
Isaac's not here.
She's asking for you.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.640
OK.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.520
GARLAND: I wonder if you'd be quite
so determined to fight Correction

21:01.520 --> 21:03.800
if you saw what it was capable of.

21:10.520 --> 21:15.520
I, Rachel Carey, am currently
within the legal jurisdiction

21:15.520 --> 21:17.520
of the Russian Federation.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.440
I have been offered safe
harbour by the Russian state

21:20.440 --> 21:22.200
and I have accepted.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.000
Make that "safe harbour
and protection".

21:38.080 --> 21:41.440
I have been offered safe harbour
and protection by the Russian state

21:41.440 --> 21:43.560
and I have accepted.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.880
"Gratefully accepted"?

21:44.880 --> 21:46.560
Sounds good to me.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.080
VIDEO: And I have
gratefully accepted.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.120
This is the program
used on Isaac Turner.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.240
I forgot to mention the other perk
of joining the operation.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.280
I have control of the kit.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.360
Do you feel guilty
for your betrayal, DCI Carey?

22:06.360 --> 22:07.920
TYPING

22:10.400 --> 22:12.560
I do.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.760
I deeply, deeply regret
what I've done.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.520
You can't win, Rachel.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.720
Surely you can see that.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.200
Have you read the Home Office
whistle-blower's claims, Mr Turner?

22:44.200 --> 22:47.760
You know, Ralph, today's meant to
be about these young people

22:47.760 --> 22:50.000
trying to achieve their goals.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.240
CHEERING

23:01.680 --> 23:04.320
OK, fine people of the press,

23:04.320 --> 23:07.400
if you'd care to decamp
to the hospitality suite,

23:07.400 --> 23:09.160
Mr Turner will join presently

23:09.160 --> 23:11.720
to answer any related questions
you have.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.640
Let's keep them related, please.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.320
All righty.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.000
Hi, darling.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.080
Are you OK?

23:18.080 --> 23:19.320
What are you...?

23:19.320 --> 23:22.280
Wait. How...How did you
even know I'd be here?

23:22.280 --> 23:25.320
You've been tweeting about it
all morning.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.480
What's up?

23:29.480 --> 23:31.240
I went to see Aliza.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.120
Aliza? Why did you do that?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.320
I thought I might get somewhere.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.720
Somewhere with...?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.800
The question no-one seems
inclined to answer.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.480
We good?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.360
Erm, just a second.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.760
If Victoria Bello was lying,
why was her application obstructed

23:47.760 --> 23:49.080
by the Home Office?

23:49.080 --> 23:51.760
Oh, right. You know, I've actually
been looking into that.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.000
I managed to collar
the Home Secretary about it.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.200
You can stop, Isaac. Aliza obviously
knows you better than I do.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.760
It seems the whole
of Westminster does.

23:59.760 --> 24:02.680
Simmy...
Why did they assume it was true?

24:02.680 --> 24:06.080
Erm...probably because they judge me

24:06.080 --> 24:09.280
by the same pathetically low
standards as the rest of them.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.960
The Palace of Westminster

24:10.960 --> 24:13.400
is basically a midlife crisis
support centre.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.840
"I was away from home." Go on.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.680
You know, "I was away from home.
It was an emotional time. She's..."

24:18.680 --> 24:21.400
She's a good-looking girl.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.680
Yes, I suppose. Woman.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.400
You were in a mood with me.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.360
I was in a mood...?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.720
It was my mother's funeral.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.960
Yes, I was upset.
I-I needed support.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.040
And Victoria Bello gave you some.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.000
No.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.880
Swear on the children.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.800
Swe...? What?

24:42.800 --> 24:45.200
I need to shake
this lingering doubt, Isaac.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.400
You know, I am in the middle
of a press conference.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.640
Swear on the children
none of it's true.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.960
Uh...

24:52.960 --> 24:54.360
OK. OK.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.320
Erm...I swear.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.040
I swear...

24:58.040 --> 25:01.080
..on the children, on us,
on everything I hold dear...

25:01.080 --> 25:03.440
..Victoria Bello's claim was false.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.520
Her son's not mine.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.200
Obviously.

25:18.040 --> 25:22.040
You...didn't submit a sample,
did you?

25:23.840 --> 25:25.640
For the paternity test?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.760
It's a simple question, Isaac.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.640
Did you submit
a sample of your DNA?

25:34.280 --> 25:35.560
No.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.840
So, they faked the result on TV,
like you said they would?

25:38.840 --> 25:41.200
No. The result was negative.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.440
A fake result
would have been positive.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.040
So...it's only fake
if you disagree with it?

25:48.720 --> 25:52.000
I'm not the father of that kid,
Simone. Everyone knows that.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.440
Everyone knows it
because it's on the news. Yes.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.920
You told me not to trust the news.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.080
How are we doing, guys? OK.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.760
You...You can trust the news,
Simone.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.240
Why would you say I couldn't?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.080
I...I was confused.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.200
Confused? Need another minute?

26:06.200 --> 26:08.680
What about those
racial profiling comments?

26:08.680 --> 26:09.800
OK...

26:09.800 --> 26:12.200
What about them?
Were you confused then?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.360
Erm...yes.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.920
Confused when you made them,

26:14.920 --> 26:17.600
or confused when you told me
you didn't make them?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.400
Jesus, Isaac! Do you even know?

26:21.400 --> 26:24.640
The confusion is pretty
non-fucking-stop, Simone.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.560
But now...now...things are good.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.320
Things are going our way. So you
don't need to keep asking questions

26:29.320 --> 26:30.720
and picking everything apart.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.320
Oh, but I do, Isaac, because
I need to get to the truth.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.840
And right now,
I'm nowhere fucking near it!

26:35.840 --> 26:38.640
How do I know nothing happened
between you and that woman?

26:38.640 --> 26:42.080
Because you just heard me
swear it on our kids' lives!

26:42.080 --> 26:47.320
But that's...that's not quite what
you said, though, is it?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.280
You thought I wouldn't notice.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.960
Oh, my. You have lost me.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.720
Do you think I'm stupid?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.440
No. I've been around
politicians too long.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.800
OK, what did I say, then? You said
Victoria Bello's claim was untrue.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.400
Yes. And that her son's not yours.
Which he isn't.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.000
But you didn't say nothing happened.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.280
How do you know her son's
not yours, Isaac?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.520
If there's no paternity test.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.320
Is it because you didn't fuck
her or because you used protection?

27:25.280 --> 27:26.880
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

27:25.280 --> 27:26.880
Erm...Isaac.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.280
Just fucking wait! No, it's OK.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.080
I came for the truth, I think I've
seen it. Listen... You know...

27:33.080 --> 27:36.800
You know condoms aren't 100%.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.680
Do you realise that?

27:49.480 --> 27:55.680
Isaac Turner and I discovered
a shared interest in exposing

27:55.680 --> 27:59.880
Correction, an interest the MP
no longer appears to share.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.480
Khadija Khan became aware of
Correction

28:04.480 --> 28:06.120
after the hack on the studio.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.120
Because you enlightened her.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.400
I saw an ally in blowing
the whistle, yes.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.160
Does Khan have your dossier?

28:28.160 --> 28:29.640
No, sir.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.440
I was concerned she'd broadcast
before I gained enough evidence.

28:34.440 --> 28:38.000
I decided not to share it.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.960
She knows about Correction.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.920
I mean... What?

28:46.840 --> 28:49.880
All Khadija Khan seems
to care about is Khadija Khan,

28:49.880 --> 28:52.440
getting her claws into the next
exclusive.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.600
She knew that interview
with Victoria Bello

28:54.600 --> 28:57.600
would mean losing Isaac's trust.
She couldn't help herself.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.280
Isaac Turner doesn't trust Khan?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.960
Erm...there's something else,
ma'am.

29:07.320 --> 29:12.440
You'll find copies of all the files
in my dossier on SD cards hidden

29:12.440 --> 29:14.640
beneath the radio in my car.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.320
PHONE RINGS

29:48.280 --> 29:49.520
Jen. Anthony.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.640
I'm calling for a favour.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.120
Right. Well, you know me.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.440
You're retiring, I hear.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.840
Spend more time with the family,

30:04.840 --> 30:06.760
or can't take any more guilt?

30:12.240 --> 30:15.600
We need you to provide a statement.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.640
About the dossier.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.400
About Vanguard.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.360
As sole witness to
last night's events,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.320
your testimony is critical.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.160
You were following up on a routine
inquiry in the offices

30:40.160 --> 30:44.040
of Truro Analytics when you became
aware of intruders in the building.

30:44.040 --> 30:48.920
Your priority then became the safety
of their assumed target -

30:48.920 --> 30:50.200
Mr Gregory Knox.

30:52.200 --> 30:56.520
Shortly after securing Mr Knox
in his office, armed support arrived

30:56.520 --> 31:00.840
to neutralise the threat.
Due to their ongoing deployment

31:00.840 --> 31:02.200
on covert operations,

31:02.200 --> 31:05.480
the identities of the armed officers
will be redacted from your report.

31:05.480 --> 31:09.360
However, you can confirm
the identity of the man fatally

31:09.360 --> 31:10.880
wounded at the scene...

31:12.160 --> 31:13.960
..as that of Nikolai Mirsky...

31:15.440 --> 31:19.160
..a Russian national and the prime
suspect in the murders

31:19.160 --> 31:22.960
of Edison Yao and Joseph Mwangi,

31:22.960 --> 31:25.040
Jason McKenna, Lee Bradbury...

31:27.680 --> 31:29.000
..and Patrick Flynn.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.040
Surprised you didn't just fake
the signature.

31:35.800 --> 31:40.320
You're not concerned about
the fallout from Moscow?

31:40.320 --> 31:41.880
Moscow will deny it,

31:41.880 --> 31:44.040
but they won't disprove it.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.280
I prefer it that way...

31:46.280 --> 31:48.120
..no-one knowing what to believe.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.080
Sir, I understand that you are
asking me to comply with a

31:56.080 --> 32:00.680
false-flag op to protect Frank
Napier and Gregory Knox. I just...

32:03.040 --> 32:04.920
I'd just like to know why.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.840
You hear that prick? Hands me the
drive,

32:12.840 --> 32:15.880
tells me I've got to wait
for the code.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.280
Yes, I can believe it.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.600
Get me into this.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.640
Knox is the prick.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.600
You're kind of hard to get rid of,
aren't you?

32:29.600 --> 32:32.960
Like a stubborn turd -
just won't flush.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.960
Why don't you brief Rachel
on the contents of that drive?

32:36.960 --> 32:38.960
Is that an order?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.160
Yeah.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.480
Greg Knox may be a piece of shit,
but he crunches data for every big

32:48.480 --> 32:50.960
tech company that matters.
Know how long we've been trying

32:50.960 --> 32:53.080
to make a deal with somebody
like that?

32:53.080 --> 32:54.240
What kind of deal?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.480
I helped him play puppet master
to his politician.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.800
For that, he gave me the secret
weapon -

32:59.800 --> 33:01.280
Truro's algorithm.

33:01.280 --> 33:05.840
Access to almost 3 billion
social media accounts worldwide.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.240
So you can track the activity
of just about anyone?

33:09.240 --> 33:12.000
Not track - predict.

33:14.440 --> 33:20.120
The algorithm calculates behaviour
right down to how suggestible a guy

33:20.120 --> 33:24.120
is to changing his toothpaste
or who he's going to vote for.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.680
You can also predict how prone he
is to dissent.

33:27.680 --> 33:32.600
Anyone from Bangkok to Mexico City
to Portland, Oregon

33:32.600 --> 33:36.040
even thinks about subversion,
we'll know about it.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.440
Not if we can't access the drive,
we won't.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.960
What am I looking at?

33:40.960 --> 33:44.160
Well, you're looking at it -
I just can't transfer it.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.120
You mean you can get into the BBC
but you can't hack into this?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.320
This has AES 256-bit cipher.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.360
I can hack it,
if you want to lose data.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.760
Why won't Knox give you the code?

33:57.120 --> 33:59.240
He's not happy with the work...

34:00.440 --> 34:01.640
..carnage...

34:02.960 --> 34:04.440
..the trail of bodies.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.120
He's concerned it might all
lead back to him, right?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.560
Right.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.080
He'll give me the code -

34:13.080 --> 34:15.840
when everybody is looking
the other way.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.080
East.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.760
Good work, Rachel.

35:09.160 --> 35:13.040
A landmark move for global
security, if not democracy.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.440
Have you forgotten already?

35:18.440 --> 35:21.640
What did I teach you about flipping
an operation to our advantage?

35:24.360 --> 35:26.240
The room's yours, Todd.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.320
Rachel and I are stepping
out for a while.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.440
Where are we going, ma'am?

35:30.440 --> 35:34.440
You heard Frank. Gregory Knox
is trying to plant a politician

35:34.440 --> 35:36.080
who answers to big tech.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.400
We are going to stop him.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.440
Can I get a very weak Earl Grey
with lots of milk?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.600
How's the all-seeing AI, Gregory?

35:52.640 --> 35:54.600
The great and powerful programme.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.080
Is there a problem?

35:56.080 --> 35:57.640
Erm...a slight problem, yes.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.920
It seems I've hit a slight bump
in the road

35:59.920 --> 36:02.200
that your algorithm
failed to predict.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.840
Simone says she's going to fucking
leave me. Already?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.360
Al...? What?

36:06.360 --> 36:07.680
Ah, right.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.040
HE SIGHS

36:07.680 --> 36:10.040
Wow.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.400
You...You don't seem too alarmed.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.400
I can't imagine your algorithm's
going to love my chances of success

36:15.400 --> 36:16.760
if I end up getting divorced.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.240
You can never second guess
that thing. So what?

36:19.240 --> 36:22.480
We might not have a problem
if someone does, in fact, leave me?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.000
Not necessarily.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.280
You knew? Hmm?

36:32.040 --> 36:33.800
You knew. You knew.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.120
You knew dragging Victoria Bello
out the woodwork

36:36.120 --> 36:39.360
would destroy my marriage.
No, I knew it...it might.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.280
It...? What the fuck?

36:41.280 --> 36:44.040
Isaac, you told us when we first
met you wanted to get to the top.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.640
Not if it meant losing my family.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.760
You didn't stipulate that.
Are you insane?

36:47.760 --> 36:51.840
I'm sorry, Isaac, but the program
just doesn't see you with Simone.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.800
A significant percentage
of the electorate perceives

36:57.800 --> 37:02.360
your marriage as somewhat strategic
and they don't like it.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.600
Do you really think it's the first
time I've heard that -

37:05.600 --> 37:08.000
that I married
Simone to climb the ladder?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.880
I've had it thrown at me
for 13 years.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.240
So if you really think
I'm going to give in to it now,

37:12.240 --> 37:14.680
you and your algorithm can both
go fuck yourselves.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.440
It's bullshit. It's what people
think.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.320
Then why don't you change
what they think?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.800
I thought that was your job.
My job is to get you into power.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.640
Your job is to change the world
when you get there.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.360
Ah, gentlemen.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.720
Guess which swinging dick
of broadcasting

37:32.720 --> 37:36.760
I've just got off the phone to -
Anthony Reed OBE.

37:36.760 --> 37:41.720
He's offering an exclusive interview
- Thursday night, 8pm, BBC One.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.280
Shall we pencil it?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.360
DOOR OPENS

38:18.600 --> 38:20.120
DOOR CLOSES

38:20.120 --> 38:21.480
What about the boy?

38:22.880 --> 38:24.680
The boy?

38:24.680 --> 38:26.440
Amandi.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.000
Victoria's son?

38:29.360 --> 38:34.080
Seeing as you seem to know so much,
I thought you might oblige me.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.960
What about?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.640
Is he...?

38:43.640 --> 38:44.960
Yours?

38:49.080 --> 38:51.640
Heavens, I have no idea.

38:53.520 --> 38:57.000
There are some details,
Isaac, even I'm not privy to.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.440
Weak Earl Grey with
lots of milk. Ah, perfect.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.560
Erm, are we...?

39:16.920 --> 39:18.840
Meeting Khadija Khan.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.880
If you're hoping to flip
Khadija, ma'am,

39:20.880 --> 39:22.800
I'm the wrong person to take with
you.

39:22.800 --> 39:26.440
We didn't end on good terms.
I know.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.280
I deployed someone to keep
track of your movements

39:29.280 --> 39:30.720
while Vanguard was down.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.040
I imagine this is going to be pretty
awkward for you, huh?

39:35.280 --> 39:37.480
I find myself with a problem.

39:37.480 --> 39:42.840
Some highly classified intelligence
has recently been disclosed to you.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.040
I trust DCI Carey's presence leaves
you in no doubt

39:46.040 --> 39:48.720
as to what
intelligence I am referring.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.080
As DCI Carey will confirm,

39:51.080 --> 39:56.080
this serious breach coincided with
a period of personal difficulty

39:56.080 --> 39:58.520
for the detective, which she now

39:58.520 --> 40:02.280
recognises impacted negatively
on her mental health and wellbeing,

40:02.280 --> 40:05.520
in particular her behaviour
in the workplace.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.040
Forgive me if I'm speaking
out of turn.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.080
No. I can confirm all of that.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.200
It explains the public outburst.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.000
Last person who yelled at me like
that's now editing the One Show.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.760
So, I realise I need something
solid on the table

40:23.760 --> 40:26.880
if I'm to earn your cooperation.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.120
The service has long enjoyed
a mutually beneficial relationship

40:31.120 --> 40:35.000
with one trusted individual
inside this organisation.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.240
The incumbent isn't getting
any younger.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.800
Anthony Reed?

40:40.800 --> 40:42.480
He's a fucking spook?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.920
In some ways, you're better
informed than him already,

40:45.920 --> 40:49.040
and I'll wager we can agree
on one operational goal

40:49.040 --> 40:50.520
in the immediate term.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.640
Sorry, are you tapping me up?

40:52.640 --> 40:56.760
There's no official contract,
no financial agreement.

40:56.760 --> 41:01.200
Your reward will be doing your bit
for national security

41:01.200 --> 41:04.080
and in the bountiful source
of information that will become

41:04.080 --> 41:09.000
available to you from the all-seeing
eye of British intelligence -

41:09.000 --> 41:10.840
directly and exclusively...

41:12.720 --> 41:14.160
..to you.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.960
What operational goal?

41:24.320 --> 41:28.760
Today brings to an end a highly
sophisticated campaign of targeted

41:28.760 --> 41:32.360
gun violence that has gripped
counter-terrorism

41:32.360 --> 41:34.880
command for six long days.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.240
A devastating campaign
that has claimed the lives

41:39.240 --> 41:42.040
of five innocent victims -

41:42.040 --> 41:45.320
three of which were serving
police officers.

41:45.320 --> 41:50.040
The manhunt was concluded in a
standoff during which a 39-year-old

41:50.040 --> 41:53.880
white male was fatally wounded by
firearms officers.

41:53.880 --> 41:59.720
The identity of the individual has
been confirmed as Nikolai Mirsky,

41:59.720 --> 42:05.000
a Russian national and the prime
suspect in our investigation.

42:09.800 --> 42:13.160
Our assessment of the motive
for these attacks continues,

42:13.160 --> 42:15.960
but the evidence overwhelmingly
indicates

42:15.960 --> 42:18.840
the involvement of agents
of a foreign state.

42:22.120 --> 42:28.280
I would like to pay a heartfelt
tribute to those officers who made

42:28.280 --> 42:29.960
the ultimate sacrifice...

42:35.760 --> 42:37.360
..giving up their lives...

42:39.520 --> 42:41.840
..in the service of protecting us.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.720
I did say you should give
her a call.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.360
You did, ma'am, yes.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.760
It's Rachel, isn't it?

43:11.920 --> 43:15.720
Yvonne, I'm so, so sorry
for your loss.

43:17.160 --> 43:20.320
They told me you were there
when it happened.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.120
I...

43:22.120 --> 43:25.000
I was the first to reach the ward
the night of the attack,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.640
but, by the time I got to Patrick...

43:27.640 --> 43:31.360
I'm not talking about Patrick.
I'm talking about the Russian.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.560
You were there when they killed him.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.480
Yes.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.960
Thank you.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.520
You're coming down the Crown,
Carey.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.040
You're not putting your hand
in your pocket all night.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.920
SHE SIGHS

44:00.040 --> 44:01.920
I don't think so.

44:01.920 --> 44:05.280
You're the hero of Vanguard.
We're not going without you.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.680
Perhaps you ought to...

44:14.960 --> 44:16.560
..hero.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.360
Abi. I was seriously thinking
about checking the news

45:38.360 --> 45:40.440
to see if you'd been found
in a ditch somewhere.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.680
Sorry. Shit sister.

45:44.360 --> 45:47.080
Was that all right the other day?

45:47.080 --> 45:48.160
The laptop?

45:49.640 --> 45:50.960
Did I do it right?

45:52.720 --> 45:54.160
Yeah, Abi.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.200
You did it just right.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.240
I've got to go.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.480
Big day tomorrow.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.920
Should he stay or should he go?

46:11.920 --> 46:16.000
As Gill fights for his political
life, the security minister who saw

46:16.000 --> 46:19.680
the Home Office crisis from inside
could deliver the decisive blow.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.880
Join me for an exclusive interview
with Isaac Turner,

46:23.880 --> 46:25.800
tonight live on BBC One.

46:25.800 --> 46:26.960
Home Office.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.520
Home truths.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.640
Right. So, first-hand knowledge,

47:17.640 --> 47:21.120
Gill obstructed Victoria Bello's
application.

47:21.120 --> 47:23.840
Fast-tracked his housekeeper's
visa, his wife's

47:23.840 --> 47:26.240
cousin's passport application.

47:26.240 --> 47:28.800
Yes, I know. We've been over this.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.320
Well, Gregory would like us
to run over it again.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.200
HE SIGHS

47:34.200 --> 47:36.360
Where's Reed?

47:34.200 --> 47:36.360
PHONE BEEPS

47:36.360 --> 47:37.520
Oh, shit.

47:37.520 --> 47:41.160
"Apologies for the hold up,
nanoseconds away, Anthony."

47:41.160 --> 47:44.600
We're ready to line up when you
are, Mr Turner.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.320
Here's your water, Mr Turner.
Thank you.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.800
Just going to mic you up.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.200
Intercept in six minutes.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.000
Camera feed secure.
Video capture in progress.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.880
Bring it up.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.280
I still remember my first time.

48:30.720 --> 48:33.200
Can I just check the level
on that mic?

48:33.200 --> 48:36.840
What did you have for breakfast?
Er, eggs, toast.

48:36.840 --> 48:40.320
Coffee? Perfect. Caviar.
Where...Where is Reed?

48:40.320 --> 48:43.880
Zac, catch me.
I'm parachuting in.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.800
You're...You're not Anthony Reed.
Well, thanks.

48:46.800 --> 48:50.520
You're not the Prime Minister,
but we play the hands we're dealt.

48:50.520 --> 48:54.160
Anthony sends his apologies.
Family matter.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.680
I have my theories.

48:57.160 --> 49:00.280
Bollocks. I'm pulling it.
What? Why? Let's go.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.280
I should really call the office.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.920
You don't need to call the office,
I'm pulling it.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.320
The interview's been trailed, mate.
Yeah, not with her

49:08.320 --> 49:10.400
asking the questions, it hasn't. Oh!

49:12.760 --> 49:14.200
Isaac.

49:25.640 --> 49:30.520
Isaac. You really want to make
this decision - unilaterally?

49:30.520 --> 49:33.040
Rhys, remind me - who do you work
for?

49:33.040 --> 49:35.840
No, it's not a trick question
or a difficult one.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.680
You work for me, but if you'd rather
work for someone else, please,

49:38.680 --> 49:40.440
by all means, fuck off!

49:41.520 --> 49:42.800
Isaac.

49:48.520 --> 49:51.320
Clear set. Strike this please, Mel.
Thank you. Take water.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.920
Let's get her mic'd up.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.760
Intercept in four minutes.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.960
Thank you.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.160
Come right in.
Right over here.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.240
Digital asset rendering.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.680
Billy?
Do you have a mirror, please?

50:09.080 --> 50:11.360
Check the batteries on that.
Yeah? Good?

50:11.360 --> 50:13.240
Where...Where is Reed?

50:13.240 --> 50:16.120
What did you have for breakfast?
I had some porridge.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.960
Bollocks. Got enough?

50:18.960 --> 50:23.280
More than enough.
Digital assets standing by.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.000
PHONE RINGS OUT

50:35.040 --> 50:39.160
Hello. So, listen, I've pulled
the interview.

50:40.800 --> 50:43.840
What? 20 seconds to transmission.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.320
Deploy the asset.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.080
Asset deployed. Asset deployed.

50:55.080 --> 50:58.120
ANNOUNCER: Time for some home truths
now on BBC One.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.600
In an update to our advertised
programme...

51:00.600 --> 51:02.360
Anthony Reed never showed.

51:02.360 --> 51:06.240
Khadija Khan turned up at the last
minute. Something's not quite right.

51:07.480 --> 51:12.120
..an exclusive live interview
with the MP on everybody's mind.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.960
You've pulled the interview?

51:13.960 --> 51:16.320
Yes. I walked.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.000
The truth is coming.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.280
And when it comes, you'll know
about it, believe me.

51:22.280 --> 51:24.760
PROGRAMME VOICEOVER: If proof were
ever needed that a week

51:24.760 --> 51:26.440
is a long time in politics,

51:26.440 --> 51:29.400
hit replay on Zac Turner's.
In just seven days...

51:29.400 --> 51:32.800
60 seconds to intercept.
60 seconds to... Digital asset

51:32.800 --> 51:35.320
standing by. Digital asset
standing by.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.240
..a Home Office scandal worthy
of soap opera. We don't have to...

51:38.240 --> 51:40.760
No, no, it's fine.
The latest twist has seen Zac

51:40.760 --> 51:43.040
strike back with the help
of a Home Office

51:43.040 --> 51:47.920
whistle-blower and a dossier of
dirt on his former boss, Rowan Gill.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.160
Motherfuck you all!

51:49.160 --> 51:53.760
Tonight, in an exclusive interview
live from London, we hear from

51:53.760 --> 51:55.720
Isaac Turner... 30 seconds to
intercept.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.600
Eyeline check. ..about the most
controversial week of his career,

51:59.600 --> 52:02.520
his own political ambitions...
Khadija.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.320
..and who he believes should
take the hit...

52:05.320 --> 52:07.280
How's that? Eyeline set.
Clear frame.

52:07.280 --> 52:10.320
Clear frame.
..for the crisis at the Home Office.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.720
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

52:14.000 --> 52:16.280
Is she going to be all right?

52:20.960 --> 52:22.680
I hope you know what you're doing.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.360
I'm heading back to you right now.
But, listen,

52:26.360 --> 52:27.600
the two of us need to talk.

52:27.600 --> 52:31.320
Intercept in six, five, four...

52:31.320 --> 52:34.880
Things have got to be different, OK?
From now on,

52:34.880 --> 52:37.800
I want to be involved in every
decision.

52:42.920 --> 52:45.560
OK?

52:45.560 --> 52:48.160
Gregory? You walked.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.680
Yes.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.520
Intercept is live.
Intercept is live.

52:57.600 --> 53:01.560
Was the wrong man fired
from the Home Office this week?

53:10.520 --> 53:15.080
If you're referring to my erstwhile
colleague, the Home Secretary,

53:15.080 --> 53:17.720
it's not my call to make.
I'm not the Prime Minister.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.760
If the rumours in Westminster
are to be believed,

53:19.760 --> 53:23.160
you'd like to be. Oh-ho,
in Westminster's a big if.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.000
It's not a denial, then?

53:25.000 --> 53:27.760
After the week I've had, Khadija,
I think it'd be unwise for me

53:27.760 --> 53:30.560
to launch a bid for Number 10.
ON PHONE: Gregory? Hello?

53:30.560 --> 53:33.040
Just the Home Office?
Who is this?

53:34.600 --> 53:36.320
Erm...

53:36.320 --> 53:38.720
Gregory, it's...

53:38.720 --> 53:41.720
..it's me.

53:38.720 --> 53:41.720
CALL-END ALERT

53:48.680 --> 53:50.720
You said no more deep fakes.

53:59.400 --> 54:03.040
Britain deserves a Home Office
that's fit for purpose.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.880
PHONE RINGS

54:03.040 --> 54:04.880
I tried to stop them.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.560
I really tried. Is it fucking him?

54:07.560 --> 54:10.400
Is what fucking him?
Britain deserves a Home Secretary

54:10.400 --> 54:13.400
who's up to the job.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.080
Ah... I don't know what this is.
Right. By up to the job,

54:16.080 --> 54:19.040
I don't mean scurrying around
SW1A getting caught up

54:19.040 --> 54:20.640
in allegations of misconduct.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.960
He's doing OK.

54:21.960 --> 54:24.360
I mean rising above the
Westminster... Gregory? Sh!

54:24.360 --> 54:27.840
..bubble to confront every threat
to British democracy head-on.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.320
But, Greg...Gregory.
It's not him.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.280
Erm, excuse me.
Can you turn around?

54:32.280 --> 54:34.560
I need to go back to the hotel.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.240
Erm...

54:37.240 --> 54:39.440
Hello. Excuse me.

54:40.520 --> 54:43.200
Driver! Hello!

54:44.760 --> 54:47.680
Are you suggesting there
are threats to British democracy

54:47.680 --> 54:51.600
not being confronted?
I'm not suggesting it, Khadija,

54:51.600 --> 54:53.840
I'm saying it loud and clear.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.600
Can you indicate the nature
of some of those threats?

54:56.600 --> 54:58.040
Two words...

55:00.920 --> 55:02.600
..big tech.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.000
What?!
KHADIJA: Big tech?

55:05.000 --> 55:08.520
Whatever Gregory Knox is paying you,
it's not going to be worth the hell

55:08.520 --> 55:11.920
I'm going to unleash if you
don't turn this fucking car around!

55:11.920 --> 55:15.360
We all know the extent
to which technology and social media

55:15.360 --> 55:17.440
has infiltrated our daily lives.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.600
It's in our homes,
it's on our screens.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.560
It's got our children hooked.

55:21.560 --> 55:24.480
I dare say I'm not the only dad
in the country who regrets giving in

55:24.480 --> 55:27.000
to their daughter's demands
for a smartphone.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.160
Nice detail.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.040
But it's also infiltrated
our political systems -

55:31.040 --> 55:34.760
not just in Britain, but around
the world. Infiltrated how?

55:34.760 --> 55:39.400
By harvesting our data without our
consent and using it to interfere

55:39.400 --> 55:42.640
with elections, referendums,
political campaigns.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.160
You're saying that tech
corporations are meddling

55:45.160 --> 55:47.240
in UK politics directly?

55:47.240 --> 55:48.760
Well, not directly.

55:48.760 --> 55:53.000
The dirty work tends to be done
by data analytics companies

55:53.000 --> 55:54.720
outside of Silicon Valley. Shit!

55:54.720 --> 55:56.560
Here in the UK, for instance?

55:56.560 --> 56:01.240
I can think of one such
example here in the UK, yes.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.640
Frank, is this you?

56:04.640 --> 56:06.920
What the fuck are you doing to me?!

56:06.920 --> 56:08.920
How much of this is illegal?

56:10.040 --> 56:12.920
Well, we've seen how nimble
these guys can be when it comes

56:12.920 --> 56:15.120
to dancing around tax laws.

56:15.120 --> 56:19.400
Clearly, Khadija, if a plot
to affect British democracy

56:19.400 --> 56:22.360
was directed by a member
of a foreign state,

56:22.360 --> 56:25.160
that's a serious
international incident.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.720
If a British national is found to
have colluded in such

56:27.720 --> 56:29.680
an attempt, that's treason.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.800
Holy shit!

56:35.120 --> 56:36.960
Is he fleeing already?

56:41.760 --> 56:43.920
My money's on Ecuador.

56:43.920 --> 56:47.640
Do you see any hope of holding them
to account? Not as things stand.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.800
Tech giants behave as if they're
untouchable.

56:50.800 --> 56:53.480
Britain needs a Home Secretary -
indeed, a Prime Minister - who

56:53.480 --> 56:56.280
isn't afraid to tell them
otherwise.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.840
What do you mean, none?
How's that possible?

56:58.840 --> 57:01.840
ON PHONE: We knew it was going to be
inconclusive until we received

57:01.840 --> 57:03.240
the results of the biopsy.

57:03.240 --> 57:07.400
So, from riddled to all clear?

57:07.400 --> 57:10.000
I agree it's unusual.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.280
Erm, CT imaging throws up anomalies
from time to time,

57:15.280 --> 57:17.360
but rarely this inconsistent.

57:18.440 --> 57:20.720
You'll have to come
in for a biopsy. Wait a second.

57:20.720 --> 57:24.160
These images
you've been showing me -

57:24.160 --> 57:26.280
black tar covering
all my internal organs -

57:26.280 --> 57:29.160
did you receive
those electronically?

57:29.160 --> 57:32.000
It's all electronic. By email?

57:32.000 --> 57:35.160
Uploaded to the hospital servers.
I get it from there.

57:39.800 --> 57:41.200
Motherfucker.

57:41.200 --> 57:44.840
Alarmingly, the tech industry
has done absolutely nothing

57:44.840 --> 57:47.360
to combat the issue of election
interference.

57:47.360 --> 57:49.280
And, frankly, one has to ask why.

57:49.280 --> 57:53.560
In fact, one has to wonder what
such corporations have to gain.

57:53.560 --> 57:57.280
If I'm not mistaken, DCI Carey,
you appear to be enjoying this.

58:00.440 --> 58:02.920
Gregory Knox's
plan has been sabotaged.

58:02.920 --> 58:06.120
An attack on British democracy
has been averted.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.800
Thanks to your work in particular,
DS Flynn's family

58:08.800 --> 58:11.520
feel a strong sense of justice
for Patrick.

58:15.240 --> 58:17.920
Are you starting to see the
potential for good in this strange

58:17.920 --> 58:20.400
little programme we call
Correction?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.760
Frank!

58:32.760 --> 58:34.760
Are you OK?

58:34.760 --> 58:36.480
Never better.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.520
Fit as a mule, apparently.

58:38.520 --> 58:44.000
I mean, doctor says I may be looking
at a benign stomach ulcer, but...

58:47.400 --> 58:49.040
You mean...? Hm?

58:50.280 --> 58:52.040
Biopsy report came back.

58:53.360 --> 58:54.840
I don't have cancer.

58:56.520 --> 58:58.760
But that's...incredible.

58:58.760 --> 59:00.880
It is incredible,

59:00.880 --> 59:03.560
when you consider that,
just the other day, my CT scan

59:03.560 --> 59:06.200
indicated I was riddled with it.
It doesn't make sense.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.280
That's right after I told
you how sick I was.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.720
You need to go in for some more
tests. What the fuck did you do?

59:10.720 --> 59:12.320
What did I do?
Don't fucking lie to me.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.280
Frank, I have no idea what
you're talking...

59:14.280 --> 59:16.880
I know you're behind this.
You're obviously very upset.

59:16.880 --> 59:20.000
All that talk about redemption,
about Sunday School.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.720
You wanted my fucking op,
didn't you?

59:21.720 --> 59:24.280
Well, something had to be done
after the shit shower

59:24.280 --> 59:27.120
you made of it!
Are you out of your fucking mind?

59:27.120 --> 59:30.320
You hacked my medical records!

59:30.320 --> 59:32.440
Don't you hate it when
mum and dad argue?

59:32.440 --> 59:34.560
Think about it. You're not dying -
it's good...

59:34.560 --> 59:36.760
Don't worry. I've got you.

59:39.320 --> 59:41.520
It's good news, Frank.
You're not dying. It is good...

59:41.520 --> 59:43.840
It's good news! Have you any idea
what I've been through?

59:43.840 --> 59:45.760
I was up on the roof. You were what?

59:45.760 --> 59:47.520
I was looking right down
into the traffic.

59:47.520 --> 59:48.920
I could have jumped!

59:50.360 --> 59:52.440
But, obviously, Khadija,

59:52.440 --> 59:56.360
there are other ways in which
the government has failed us.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.800
Which other ways? Well, that would
have been deeply regrettable.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:00.960
Regrettable?!

1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:03.480
I would have been tomato bisque
on the sidewalk. Wait!

1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:05.480
Are you fucking nuts?
Wait! What is not known

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:08.280
is the extent to which
deepfake technology has already

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.280
pervaded our society. In what sense?

1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:14.880
The truth is, deepfakes
have been deployed by the British

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:17.160
authorities for a number of years
now... What's this?

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:21.280
..in ways that threaten our core
values of democracy, liberty...

1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:22.640
What is this? ..rule of law.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.920
Mr Turner, you have to admit that
the idea of British authorities...

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:30.680
This is not in the script.
This is not my script.

1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:32.040
This operation is compromised.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:34.160
Compromised? What the fuck
you talking about?

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.720
It's the transcript you gave me.
No, it isn't. Khadija, wrap it up.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.440
Did you switch the script? No, of
course not! Khadija, wrap it up.

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.520
Wrap it up. KHADIJA: Deepfakes are
deployed...

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:46.520
Khadija, wrap it up!
She can't hear you.

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:49.080
If I ever...
Unless she's in on it.

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:50.280
Shut the whole thing down.

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:53.240
I can't get in! The asset or
the transmission? Everything.

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:54.480
Everything.

1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:57.400
Ma'am, you can't cut the broadcast.

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.960
Right now, he's just a politician
with a conspiracy theory.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.400
Shut it down,
everyone will believe it.

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:03.960
She's got a point.

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:15.320
Does she?

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:20.560
Mr Turner, deepfakes
have been deployed in what way?

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:26.720
They call it Correction.

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:32.760
It's a method of real-time video
manipulation, using the disruption

1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:35.640
of camera feeds and the deployment
of deepfake technology.

1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:39.640
Who do you mean by "they"? Members
of our own intelligence services,

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:42.520
our government
and the police.

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:46.560
But, Mr Turner, to be clear,
you're asserting that there's some

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:49.920
sort of programme within British
intelligence to create

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:52.240
fake video footage.

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.320
Well, let's say they have intel
of a terrorist plot,

1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:58.080
but the evidence against the
suspects is insufficient...

1:01:58.080 --> 1:01:59.680
They make up incriminating footage?

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:02.720
Well, THEY would say they turn
intelligence into evidence.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.280
Rachel Carey...
This is a serious accusation.

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:17.520
..you are under arrest for breach
of the Official Secrets Act.

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:20.080
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:22.360
if you do not mention
when questioned...

1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:24.880
I am sorry, ma'am, but you're
currently within the legal

1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:27.920
jurisdiction of the
United States of America.

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:31.000
Frank. Whilst you remain within the
legal jurisdiction... You don't have

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.320
the power to arrest. ..of the
United States of America,

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.640
you must abide by the rules,
regulations

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:38.000
and limitations of US...
Frank!

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.960
Would you shut the fuck up?
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:43.760
I know how this ends.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.040
Frank, please detain DCI Carey.

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:48.520
I've reason to suspect
she's involved in subversive action

1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:51.720
against the state. Not my state.

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:54.000
He hasn't said anything
about the US.

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.040
Frank, help!

1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:00.600
For crying out loud!

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.560
She gives me cancer,
then she asks for my help.

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:08.400
The moment you set foot
outside this building,

1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:11.080
you are eligible for arrest!

1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:16.960
As we all are...

1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:20.120
..ma'am.

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:22.120
Rachel!

1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:24.080
Listen!

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:26.760
You don't know what you've done.

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.240
I know one thing...

1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.080
..Patrick Flynn hated Correction.

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:50.840
KHADIJA: And this so-called
Correction... Correction programme.

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:53.240
Correction programme -
when were you made aware of it?

1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:56.080
When I became a victim. A victim?

1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:58.800
People may have noticed
there have been a number of things

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:01.800
I've said out of character recently
- absurd ideas

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:04.120
I would never advocate.
Racial profiling, for example.

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:06.840
Are you suggesting that it wasn't
you who made those comments?

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:10.800
No, I'm not suggesting it, Khadija,
I'm saying it loud and clear.

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:16.520
Mr Turner, you have to admit
that the idea of...

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.960
I always knew you were destined
for greatness...

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:22.160
..creating false evidence...
..one way or another.

1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:25.040
..you were railing against
a moment ago.

1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:26.680
You should get down there.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.720
You're missing the best bit.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:38.560
You're not worried people will
think this is

1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:41.480
some outlandish conspiracy theory?

1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:44.200
Well, people should question it.

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:47.320
We need to challenge everything
we're told and question

1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:48.920
everything we see.

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.520
We need to ask of every voice
on every recording of every image

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.720
on every screen...

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.120
..how do we know this is real?

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.640
In his interview, for example.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:09.720
It purports to be a live broadcast.
Well, it is a live broadcast.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:12.080
Can you prove it? Well, I can go
online,

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:14.120
show the latest news headlines.

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:17.440
All right, now we're getting
somewhere. But what about me?

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:18.920
What about you?

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:25.280
Well, I look like Isaac Turner,
I sound like Isaac Turner.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:27.720
How do we know I'm the real deal?

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:33.520
Who's to say the real Isaac Turner
isn't in a car, right now,

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:35.400
on the way to Piccadilly Circus?

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:49.600
Who's to say the cameras filming
this interview haven't been hacked?

1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:53.400
Who's to say Isaac Turner's image
hasn't been captured,

1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:55.920
animated by artificial intelligence?

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:05.200
Who's to say, since the very
start of this interview,

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:08.720
while you believed you were watching
Isaac Turner,

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:12.320
you were, in fact, watching me -

1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:14.440
a deepfake. Fake...

1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:14.440
AUDIO DISRUPTION

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:18.960
It's impossible to say.

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:32.720
Unless, of course, you happen
to be in Piccadilly Circus right now

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:36.360
and can see Isaac Turner
with your own eyes, then...

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:42.240
..perhaps you can.

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:48.120
If you are in or near Piccadilly
Circus,

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:49.760
look around you.

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:55.240
Take out your phones
and start filming.

1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:01.800
Hopefully, together, we can shine
a light on the challenges

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.600
we face surrounding deepfakes.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:12.120
And, hopefully, we can begin to
raise awareness of the illegal

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.360
practice of Correction.

1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:18.520
Because only by bringing
this conspiracy out into the open

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.480
can we hope to confront it.

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:41.120
As you can see, I'm not
in the studio with Isaac Turner MP.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:44.480
Mr Turner is in
Piccadilly Circus,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.920
graciously playing his part
in our, hopefully,

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:49.280
eye-opening stunt.

1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:54.120
You have indeed been watching
a deepfake interview.

1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:02.120
But the alarming practice
of Correction described in it

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:05.480
is very much real.

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:08.120
Working with a team
of whistle-blowers from the heart

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:13.360
of British intelligence, the BBC
has obtained evidence that knowledge

1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:18.080
of the so-called Corruption
programme extends across multiple UK

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:23.120
intelligence agencies and to senior
members of the British government.

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.640
In a series of exclusive reports,

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:30.720
starting tonight, we will be
examining these alarming

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.480
revelations in detail.

1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:36.640
We will be sharing the evidence
obtained by the BBC.

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:41.320
And, finally, we will be confronting
those ultimately responsible.
