WEBVTT

01:06.608 --> 01:07.609
GIRL: Hey, Nat!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.682
We're both upside down.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.934
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.644
No, you will.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.439
You can't hold it much longer.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.357
-

01:48.233 --> 01:49.860
Told you you'd fall down first.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.322
I told you! I told you!

01:55.908 --> 01:56.950
Told you so!

01:58.827 --> 02:00.412
Mommy!

02:08.337 --> 02:09.505
What happened?

02:11.423 --> 02:12.424
She fell on her knee.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.551
-Oh, you bump your knee?
-YOUNG YELENA: Mmm-hmm.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.844
Oh...

02:21.767 --> 02:23.936
Oh, come on, little one.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.729
Get up. You're okay.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.899
Come on. You're a brave girl.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.610
Your pain only makes you stronger.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.196
-Right, you?
-Yeah.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.364
MELINA: Yeah?
YOUNG YELENA: Look!

02:35.531 --> 02:37.491
Forest stars.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.659
MELINA: Yeah. You know what?

02:38.825 --> 02:42.579
Those are actually
part of the Lampyridae family.

02:42.746 --> 02:46.291
And the glow, the glow that you see,

02:46.458 --> 02:49.920
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

02:50.963 --> 02:52.631
bioluminescence.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.716
Come on, time for dinner.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.094
YOUNG YELENA: Bio-goomin-feasants?

02:57.261 --> 02:59.638
MELINA: "Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.516
Dinner!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.852
Come on, dinner, big girl!

03:07.354 --> 03:08.897
YOUNG YELENA: I want mac and cheese.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.693
Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

03:13.026 --> 03:14.778
caviar and champagne.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.780
Grab the napkins.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.324
You take this. Thank you.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.244
Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.708
Okay.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.626
YOUNG YELENA: Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.671
Dad's home!

03:35.883 --> 03:36.967
Hey, Dad.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.552
Hey, baby.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.647
Everything okay?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.903
ALEXEI: How was everybody's day?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.071
YOUNG YELENA: Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.074
-And I fell and hurt my knee,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.785
-but it doesn't hurt anymore.
-ALEXEI: Mmm-hmm.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.954
YOUNG YELENA: And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.122
That was my favorite part

04:07.206 --> 04:08.248
-of the whole day.
-No.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.709
YOUNG NATASHA: Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.793
How long do we have?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.463
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.009
I don't wanna go.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.180
Don't say that.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.393
Girls...

04:29.770 --> 04:33.023
you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.903
-Today's the day.
-Yay!

04:40.697 --> 04:42.866
All right, let's go.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.625
I'm sorry.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.758
MELINA: Come on, we gotta hurry.
ALEXEI: Thank you.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.009
-I don't have my shoes.
-ALEXEI: Thank you, baby.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.803
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.222
-But I'm still hungry.
-Yeah? Guess what?

05:05.389 --> 05:06.765
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.777
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.619
-You have it?
-Yeah.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.830
-It's the only copy?
-It's the only one not on fire.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.301
Where are we going?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.261
Home.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.722
YOUNG YELENA: Mommy, you're silly.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.473
We just left home.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.653
I want my song.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.117
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie

06:07.284 --> 06:12.289
Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry

06:12.706 --> 06:16.835
Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye

06:17.002 --> 06:21.256
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die"

06:22.090 --> 06:25.594
"This'll be the day that I die"

06:54.957 --> 06:56.959
MELINA: Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.253
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.879
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.141
Come on. Honey, honey.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.268
-Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
-Okay.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.811
-MELINA: Nat, hurry up!
-I'm coming!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.064
MELINA: Okay. Seat belts.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.985
Okay.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.069
YOUNG NATASHA:
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.529
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.530
Mom?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.791
-Mom!

08:22.336 --> 08:23.795
I need you up here.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.257
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.301
I need you to pull right.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.057
Mom, you've got blood on you.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.225
It's okay, baby.

08:55.661 --> 08:56.954
Hit the accelerator there.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.173
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.802
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.303
Let's count together.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.931
YOUNG NATASHA AND MELINA: 45, 50...

09:16.014 --> 09:17.266
-

09:29.528 --> 09:30.737
Pull back.
You can do it!

09:31.572 --> 09:32.948
Pull back.
All your strength.

10:18.869 --> 10:19.870
ALEXEI: Okay.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.129
YOUNG YELENA: Get up, Mommy.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.508
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

10:41.892 --> 10:43.727
The Red Guardian returns.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.355
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.567
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.778
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

10:52.861 --> 10:53.946
I wanna get back in it.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.490
General Dreykov,
it's been over three years.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.913
Never let them take your heart.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.625
Did you get it?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.591
And the North Institute?

11:15.217 --> 11:16.218
Ashes.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.761
It's gonna be okay.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.972
DREYKOV: How is Melina?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.432
ALEXEI: She'll live. She's strong.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.771
-YOUNG YELENA: Mommy?
-Mom?

11:27.938 --> 11:29.898
-YOUNG YELENA: Daddy!
-I'll handle this.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.692
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Yelena!

11:31.859 --> 11:33.402
Daddy!
-Get away from her!

11:35.153 --> 11:36.238
Don't touch her!

11:38.365 --> 11:40.284
Don't touch her!

11:40.951 --> 11:42.953
I will kill you all!

11:46.498 --> 11:47.624
Honey.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.712
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.051
I don't wanna go back there.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.304
I wanna stay in Ohio.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.056
You can't take her.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.185
You can't.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.978
She's only six.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.188
ALEXEI: You were even younger.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.024
It's okay.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.943
Come here.

12:19.615 --> 12:20.616
You're gonna be all right.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.369
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

12:24.870 --> 12:30.042
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.253
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

12:33.712 --> 12:37.090
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.359
DREYKOV: That one, she has fire in her.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.029
What was her name?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.448
ALEXEI: Natasha.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.412
DREYKOV: Ah... Natasha.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.147
No!

13:45.075 --> 13:47.077
Remove all the defects.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.251
That one

13:54.710 --> 13:56.003
and her.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.588
YOUNG YELENA: No!

13:57.754 --> 13:58.755
YOUNG NATASHA: Yelena!

14:03.594 --> 14:06.096
Take it! Take it! No!

14:14.021 --> 14:15.647
No!

14:20.944 --> 14:23.197
DREYKOV:
The Red Room is your home now.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.616
YOUNG NATASHA: Get off me! No!

14:46.386 --> 14:48.889
TV REPORTER:
Undercover spies in our communities.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.725
They took on false identities,
even raised families...

16:50.719 --> 16:53.472
AGENT 1: They're topside, sir!
AGENT 2: Tier 1 has LOS!

16:54.973 --> 16:56.308
We've got all exits covered.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.477
All right. Stay alert.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.312
I'm sending in alpha squad.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.615
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the Sokovia Accords.

17:11.782 --> 17:13.700
She assaulted the king of Wakanda.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.160
Make an example out of her.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.168
-Yeah?
-Don't do this.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.545
Do what?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.547
Come after me.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.757
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.718
Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.

17:32.261 --> 17:34.555
'Cause from my vantage point,

17:34.638 --> 17:36.014
it's the federal fugitive

17:36.181 --> 17:37.266
who's desperate.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.394
NATASHA: From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.354
What is this, your second triple bypass?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.731
I wouldn't worry about me.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.150
We got Barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

17:47.317 --> 17:49.111
the incredible shrinking convict.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.989
Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.615
Where you gonna go?

17:53.782 --> 17:56.118
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.871
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.540
Romanoff?

18:27.441 --> 18:29.526
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.653
Her tracker, sir.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.383
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.888
I have sights on collateral one.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.352
Firing in place of three.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.145
Five, four...

19:05.229 --> 19:07.314
-

19:07.397 --> 19:09.233
WOMAN: She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.944
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.243
-

20:26.685 --> 20:28.270
Oksana.

20:30.731 --> 20:31.732
Oh, no.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.692
What did I do?

20:34.151 --> 20:35.652
OKSANA: Free the others.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.247
Yelena, we need a status report.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.629
Yelena,
we need a status report.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.804
Converge on team leader.

21:07.351 --> 21:10.062
General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.649
Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?

21:28.747 --> 21:31.416
-

21:37.714 --> 21:38.966
Smile.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.666
-You're in my bed.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.793
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.086
Did you get everything on my list?

22:58.253 --> 23:03.467
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

23:03.842 --> 23:07.054
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

23:07.804 --> 23:08.847
Fanny Longbottom?

23:09.014 --> 23:10.807
-What?
-What, are you 12?

23:14.645 --> 23:17.022
We've got a generator outside.

23:17.189 --> 23:20.150
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

23:20.317 --> 23:21.985
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.072
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

23:25.239 --> 23:28.283
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

23:28.825 --> 23:29.952
Nice.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.870
Are you okay?

23:32.162 --> 23:33.163
Why wouldn't I be?

23:33.330 --> 23:36.250
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

23:36.333 --> 23:38.544
Ugh. It's fine.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.254
I'm actually better on my own.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.421
Are you sure?

23:42.172 --> 23:43.173
Yeah.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.883
Because you can tell me, you know.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.718
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.721
I know. I have friends.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.766
People who have friends don't call me.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.899
And I don't pay you to worry.

24:16.206 --> 24:17.332
Oh, hey.

24:18.584 --> 24:19.626
What's all this junk?

24:20.210 --> 24:22.880
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

24:23.797 --> 24:24.798
Budapest?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.967
Yeah. Budapest.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.303
-No, it's "Budapest."
-Budapest.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.554
Budapest.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.806
-It's "Budapest."
-Whatever.

24:32.973 --> 24:36.185
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.645
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.939
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.467
HUGO DRAX: You're not
a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

25:08.634 --> 25:10.344
Why did you break up the encounter

25:10.427 --> 25:11.512
with my pet python?

25:11.595 --> 25:14.139
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

25:17.518 --> 25:18.602
Moonraker 1
on preset launch program...

25:18.685 --> 25:19.770
Oh, great.

25:19.937 --> 25:21.396
...minus two minutes.

25:21.980 --> 25:22.981
Retract crew access...

27:02.664 --> 27:05.792
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

27:08.378 --> 27:11.048
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

28:14.278 --> 28:15.863
You're not here for me.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.306
Oh, shit.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.489
I know you're out there.

31:06.533 --> 31:08.285
NATASHA: I know you know I'm out here.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.586
YELENA: Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?

31:17.753 --> 31:19.713
NATASHA: 'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.799
Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.013
NATASHA: So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

31:30.474 --> 31:31.725
Is that what we are?

31:41.860 --> 31:43.779
Put it down before I make you.

31:43.946 --> 31:45.030
You put yours down.

31:45.989 --> 31:48.367
-Watch your step.
-

32:09.012 --> 32:10.722
Stay down. Stay down.

32:11.098 --> 32:13.308
-Stay down.
-

33:38.477 --> 33:40.187
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

33:41.313 --> 33:43.482
I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.

33:44.316 --> 33:47.361
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

33:50.155 --> 33:51.782
Not bullets. Arrows.

33:51.949 --> 33:53.033
Ah, right.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.370
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

33:56.995 --> 33:58.413
You brought it back here?

34:00.874 --> 34:03.460
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

34:03.627 --> 34:05.045
YELENA: It's a synthetic gas.

34:05.212 --> 34:07.589
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

34:07.756 --> 34:09.466
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

34:09.550 --> 34:10.551
from external manipulation.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.010
Maybe in English next time?

34:16.181 --> 34:18.642
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

34:18.809 --> 34:19.935
They can explain it to you.

34:20.102 --> 34:21.603
Tony Stark, maybe?

34:21.770 --> 34:24.273
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

34:24.648 --> 34:26.400
Great. Perfect timing.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.652
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

34:28.819 --> 34:29.820
I don't wanna be here.

34:29.987 --> 34:32.239
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

34:32.406 --> 34:33.991
Well, what was I supposed to do?

34:34.074 --> 34:37.077
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

34:39.204 --> 34:41.039
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

34:44.209 --> 34:45.586
I kept checking the news,

34:45.752 --> 34:50.174
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.345
What?

34:56.763 --> 34:58.891
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

34:59.057 --> 35:00.642
It's been gone for years.

35:01.602 --> 35:02.644
Dreykov's dead.

35:03.187 --> 35:04.188
I killed him.

35:04.354 --> 35:06.440
You don't actually believe that, do you?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.155
You really do believe that.

35:13.322 --> 35:14.740
Dreykov's dead.

35:14.907 --> 35:17.159
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

35:17.326 --> 35:18.911
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.704
Tell me exactly.

35:21.663 --> 35:22.664
We rigged bombs.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.333
-Who's "we"?
-Clint Barton.

35:24.917 --> 35:27.544
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.089
Simple as that?

35:33.509 --> 35:35.177
Yeah, sure, "simple."

35:35.761 --> 35:37.679
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

35:37.846 --> 35:40.933
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.

35:41.099 --> 35:44.144
Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.

35:44.770 --> 35:45.896
And you checked the body?

35:46.063 --> 35:47.648
Confirmed the kill?

35:51.151 --> 35:52.986
There was no body left to check.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.782
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

36:56.425 --> 36:57.718
NATASHA: Where are we trying to get?

36:57.885 --> 36:59.887
YELENA: Motorbike! East side
of the building.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.294
- I got you!

37:34.880 --> 37:37.007
-No!
-

37:54.608 --> 37:56.777
-Hey.

37:57.152 --> 37:58.987
Don't move. You're hurt.

37:59.154 --> 38:00.364
Let me help you.

38:02.616 --> 38:04.451
-

38:19.716 --> 38:21.760
-What are you doing?
-He's making me.

38:51.707 --> 38:53.625
Do you believe me now?

38:55.127 --> 38:56.545
How many others?

38:56.712 --> 38:58.088
Enough.

39:10.893 --> 39:11.894
NATASHA: Which one's yours?

39:12.060 --> 39:13.478
Black. Brown seat.

39:14.354 --> 39:15.522
Where are my keys?

39:19.985 --> 39:20.986
Any day now.

40:02.444 --> 40:03.737
You can't just steal a guy's car.

40:03.904 --> 40:05.739
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

40:09.826 --> 40:11.870
-Okay. Any time now, please.
-Shut up.

40:13.163 --> 40:14.373
-

40:46.446 --> 40:47.573
Okay, you got a plan,

40:47.739 --> 40:49.199
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

40:49.366 --> 40:50.659
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

40:50.826 --> 40:52.202
That's a shit plan.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.091
You're welcome.

41:19.396 --> 41:20.647
Oh, shit. He's back.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.286
Put your seat belt on.

41:34.453 --> 41:35.662
You're such a mom.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.112
YELENA: Natasha, no.

42:09.905 --> 42:11.323
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

42:13.450 --> 42:15.285
No. Not now, trust me.

43:07.838 --> 43:08.839
You okay?

43:09.590 --> 43:11.717
Yeah. Great plan.

43:12.426 --> 43:15.470
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

43:17.097 --> 43:18.432
This is cozy.

43:18.599 --> 43:21.185
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.936
That must have been fun.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.064
Who the hell is that guy?

43:26.231 --> 43:27.608
Dreykov's special project.

43:28.150 --> 43:30.152
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

43:30.319 --> 43:31.445
It's like fighting a mirror.

43:32.154 --> 43:34.281
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

43:34.448 --> 43:36.116
This doesn't make any sense.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.745
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.873
What is that supposed to mean?

43:43.040 --> 43:45.000
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.711
You killed her.

43:48.378 --> 43:49.755
I had to.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.716
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

43:54.051 --> 43:56.553
We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.

43:58.305 --> 43:59.598
NATASHA: His car is pulling up now.

44:17.199 --> 44:19.576
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

44:21.537 --> 44:23.413
I needed her to be sure.

44:23.747 --> 44:25.123
Natasha, we clear?

44:27.417 --> 44:28.418
All clear.

44:32.923 --> 44:35.050
And here you are, not so sure.

44:35.425 --> 44:37.719
I needed out.

44:53.318 --> 44:55.028
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

44:55.195 --> 44:56.196
I have no idea.

44:56.947 --> 44:59.116
He moves location constantly.

44:59.283 --> 45:03.745
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

45:05.205 --> 45:08.458
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

45:08.625 --> 45:12.171
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.506
I mean, the clue is in the name.

45:14.673 --> 45:15.966
Dreykov kills you,

45:16.133 --> 45:18.886
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.387
Wait, what are the big ones?

45:20.554 --> 45:24.933
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

45:27.436 --> 45:29.605
Where did you think I was all this time?

45:32.983 --> 45:36.695
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

45:38.488 --> 45:40.115
And you just never made contact again?

45:40.282 --> 45:42.159
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

45:42.242 --> 45:44.870
Bullshit.

45:45.037 --> 45:47.706
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

45:47.873 --> 45:49.583
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.710
You weren't really my sister.

45:55.047 --> 45:57.591
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.135
-Why do you always do that thing?
-NATASHA: Do what?

46:00.302 --> 46:02.763
The thing you do when you're fighting.

46:02.930 --> 46:05.265
The... Like, the...

46:06.391 --> 46:08.185
This thing that you do

46:08.352 --> 46:10.395
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

46:10.562 --> 46:12.022
with the arm and the hair.

46:12.105 --> 46:14.525
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

46:16.235 --> 46:18.028
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

46:18.195 --> 46:20.113
-I'm not a poser.
-

46:20.197 --> 46:22.115
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

46:22.282 --> 46:24.952
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

46:25.118 --> 46:26.119
all the time.

46:26.203 --> 46:29.623
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

46:29.790 --> 46:33.210
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

46:33.585 --> 46:35.754
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

46:38.298 --> 46:41.051
Well, then you were fooling yourself

46:41.760 --> 46:45.556
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

46:45.973 --> 46:48.934
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

46:49.101 --> 46:51.311
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

47:09.830 --> 47:10.831
That gas,

47:11.707 --> 47:13.250
the counteragent,

47:13.584 --> 47:15.169
it was synthesized in secret

47:15.252 --> 47:18.005
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

47:18.297 --> 47:21.550
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

47:21.717 --> 47:25.554
and I killed the widow that freed me.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.306
Did you have a choice?

47:27.472 --> 47:30.267
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

47:31.810 --> 47:34.813
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

47:34.980 --> 47:37.191
They're two completely different things.

47:37.858 --> 47:41.612
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.405
I'm still not sure.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.875
-Is that all there is left?
-Mmm-hmm.

47:55.834 --> 48:00.047
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

48:02.508 --> 48:04.134
He takes more every day.

48:04.510 --> 48:07.095
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

48:07.262 --> 48:08.514
Just like us when we were small.

48:09.139 --> 48:11.642
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.185
The rest, he kills.

48:14.311 --> 48:16.146
To him, we are just things.

48:17.523 --> 48:20.567
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

48:21.527 --> 48:24.488
Because there is always more.

48:25.030 --> 48:28.325
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.118
-NATASHA: Alexei?
-

48:32.246 --> 48:33.330
YELENA: "Dad."

48:44.216 --> 48:46.927
YELENA: Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?

48:49.137 --> 48:52.766
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

48:56.019 --> 48:57.271
What about you?

48:58.272 --> 49:01.942
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

49:02.860 --> 49:05.070
My parents still live in Ohio.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.073
My sister moved out west.

49:08.156 --> 49:09.157
Is that right?

49:09.241 --> 49:10.868
You're a science teacher.

49:12.536 --> 49:15.873
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

49:16.039 --> 49:18.709
Your husband, he renovates houses.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.170
-That is not my story.
-

49:21.336 --> 49:23.046
What is your story?

49:26.216 --> 49:30.012
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

49:35.142 --> 49:36.935
Did you ever wish for kids?

49:40.147 --> 49:42.274
I want a dog.

49:48.822 --> 49:49.948
Where you gonna go?

49:50.115 --> 49:51.700
I don't know.

49:53.243 --> 49:56.455
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

49:56.538 --> 49:58.123
so I guess anywhere.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.465
-Don't.
-Don't what?

50:06.548 --> 50:09.092
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

50:09.176 --> 50:10.177
I can feel it.

50:11.428 --> 50:13.096
Speeches aren't really my thing.

50:13.180 --> 50:14.181
Huh.

50:14.890 --> 50:16.558
It was more like an invitation.

50:17.726 --> 50:20.187
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

50:20.812 --> 50:21.813
Yeah.

50:21.980 --> 50:24.233
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

50:24.316 --> 50:26.360
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

50:26.568 --> 50:27.569
Yeah.

50:27.736 --> 50:30.572
That sounds like a shitload of work.

50:35.369 --> 50:36.954
Could be fun, though.

50:38.163 --> 50:39.373
Yup.

50:46.129 --> 50:47.422
I saw where he put the keys.

50:48.048 --> 50:51.009
Top drawer, green cabinet.

51:01.144 --> 51:03.021
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

51:03.105 --> 51:04.606
I've ever bought for myself.

51:06.608 --> 51:07.985
That?

51:08.569 --> 51:09.570
Yeah. You don't like it?

51:09.736 --> 51:11.280
Is that like a...

51:12.322 --> 51:13.365
Is it army surplus, or...

51:13.532 --> 51:14.992
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

51:15.409 --> 51:17.703
-But I use them all the time,

51:17.786 --> 51:20.080
and I made some of my own
modifications.

51:20.247 --> 51:21.874
-Whatever.

51:21.957 --> 51:24.251
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

51:24.418 --> 51:27.713
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.548
I want to do things.

51:30.424 --> 51:31.508
NATASHA: Hmm...

51:31.925 --> 51:32.968
I like your vest.

51:33.302 --> 51:35.846
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

51:36.013 --> 51:37.139
It's good. Yes. I like it.

51:37.306 --> 51:40.684
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

51:44.938 --> 51:46.815
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

51:46.899 --> 51:48.984
-I'm sorry.
-I know.

51:49.151 --> 51:51.987
But I think I know somebody who does.

51:52.154 --> 51:53.155
Oh, yeah? Who?

51:53.864 --> 51:55.490
We're gonna need a jet.

51:57.159 --> 51:58.619
I said we needed a jet.

51:59.494 --> 52:01.538
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

52:01.705 --> 52:03.290
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

52:03.457 --> 52:04.958
YELENA: I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

52:05.042 --> 52:06.043
Like a real pro.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.419
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

52:07.586 --> 52:09.379
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

52:09.463 --> 52:11.131
-not to your liking?
-Ha!

52:11.298 --> 52:12.883
NATASHA: Don't let her wind you up.

52:13.050 --> 52:15.469
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

52:15.636 --> 52:19.473
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.892
You, too, huh? Tag team.

52:22.059 --> 52:25.145
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

52:25.312 --> 52:26.772
NATASHA: Where's the rest?

52:33.362 --> 52:34.613
Voilà.

52:35.239 --> 52:36.448
YELENA: Ooh.

52:37.574 --> 52:39.159
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

52:41.245 --> 52:42.496
How is it?

52:43.121 --> 52:45.874
It's dry.
It's really dry.

52:50.879 --> 52:53.006
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

52:54.341 --> 52:57.135
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

52:57.219 --> 52:58.846
all my prices go up.

53:00.889 --> 53:01.974
What's that supposed to mean?

53:02.140 --> 53:05.185
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

53:05.352 --> 53:08.313
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.399
I'm a private contractor.

53:11.817 --> 53:13.402
You are sensitive.

53:13.569 --> 53:15.112
You're a very annoying individual.

53:17.614 --> 53:19.241
-I'll make it up to you.
-Mmm-hmm.

53:20.367 --> 53:22.160
That's what you say every time.

53:27.833 --> 53:30.627
So, I have the nuclear code.

53:30.794 --> 53:34.256
But there he is.

53:35.007 --> 53:38.969
-Captain America!
-INMATES: America.

53:40.220 --> 53:45.267
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

53:46.602 --> 53:48.645
I grab hold of his shield

53:49.521 --> 53:54.526
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

53:58.739 --> 54:01.825
Oh... Oh, no.

54:02.701 --> 54:04.703
Oh...

54:06.788 --> 54:08.207
That guy think he going to beat me.

54:08.373 --> 54:10.876
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

54:11.043 --> 54:13.837
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

54:14.004 --> 54:16.173
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

54:16.340 --> 54:17.424
and I push him out the window.

54:17.925 --> 54:20.052
And I make my escape. Huh?

54:20.677 --> 54:22.262
What year was this?

54:23.388 --> 54:25.891
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

54:26.058 --> 54:27.059
I know.

54:27.142 --> 54:30.437
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

54:33.815 --> 54:36.777
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

54:40.822 --> 54:42.241
-

54:49.706 --> 54:51.792
- Oh, no.

54:52.251 --> 54:53.961
Uh-oh.

54:55.921 --> 54:57.464
Aw, look at the big bear.

54:57.631 --> 54:59.299
Gonna cry, little girl?

56:12.164 --> 56:14.166
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

56:17.044 --> 56:18.253
Move to the door on the south wall.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.318
Go left.

56:42.778 --> 56:43.820
Just don't make a scene.

56:50.661 --> 56:52.663
-

56:59.336 --> 57:01.255
You made a scene, didn't you?

57:13.225 --> 57:14.893
What now?

57:15.060 --> 57:16.895
We're gettin' you outta here.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.126
Go to the upper level.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.131
Move your ass, super soldier.

57:56.393 --> 57:57.686
He's never going to make it.

57:58.061 --> 57:59.271
Get me closer.

58:00.522 --> 58:01.815
You got a better idea?

58:05.903 --> 58:07.029
ALEXEI: Natasha.

58:18.790 --> 58:20.209
Such a poser.

58:42.231 --> 58:43.482
-

58:44.775 --> 58:46.276
Seriously?

58:47.778 --> 58:48.862
Whoo!

58:49.363 --> 58:50.739
Sorry!

58:53.367 --> 58:55.118
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

58:55.744 --> 58:56.954
Back up!

58:57.538 --> 58:59.790
YELENA: We're both doing
a really good job.

59:09.633 --> 59:10.926
No.

59:13.011 --> 59:14.721
Okay. Enough of this.

59:31.363 --> 59:32.364
Ha!

59:40.205 --> 59:42.249
Whoa...

59:47.379 --> 59:49.423
This would be a cool way to die.

59:53.177 --> 59:55.470
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

59:55.637 --> 59:56.763
Move your ass!

1:00:21.205 --> 1:00:22.831
Get us outta here!

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:24.625
Huh.

1:01:08.377 --> 1:01:10.420
Wait!

1:01:36.738 --> 1:01:38.115
Yes!

1:01:38.198 --> 1:01:40.117
-

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:42.452
I need some help up here!

1:01:55.674 --> 1:01:57.342
Oh, that was exciting.

1:01:59.678 --> 1:02:02.556
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:06.143
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

1:02:06.226 --> 1:02:08.312
Okay.

1:02:12.149 --> 1:02:13.150
Wow.

1:02:16.069 --> 1:02:18.197
Okay.

1:02:19.406 --> 1:02:21.283
Why the aggression, huh?

1:02:22.075 --> 1:02:23.535
Is it your time of the month?

1:02:23.702 --> 1:02:27.122
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

1:02:27.414 --> 1:02:28.498
Or ovaries.

1:02:29.374 --> 1:02:30.959
Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room

1:02:31.043 --> 1:02:32.461
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

1:02:32.628 --> 1:02:37.174
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

1:02:37.341 --> 1:02:40.802
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

1:02:40.969 --> 1:02:43.805
-Everything out, so you can't have babies.
-ALEXEI: Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

1:02:43.972 --> 1:02:46.475
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

1:02:46.642 --> 1:02:48.143
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

1:02:48.227 --> 1:02:50.479
-fallopian tubes, but okay.
-ALEXEI: No.

1:02:51.104 --> 1:02:56.860
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

1:02:57.027 --> 1:03:00.614
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

1:03:01.073 --> 1:03:02.282
Huh.

1:03:02.366 --> 1:03:04.159
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

1:03:04.326 --> 1:03:05.744
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

1:03:05.911 --> 1:03:09.957
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

1:03:10.457 --> 1:03:13.252
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

1:03:13.752 --> 1:03:15.379
'Cause they treated me like family.

1:03:15.546 --> 1:03:17.381
ALEXEI: Really? Family?

1:03:17.548 --> 1:03:19.842
Well, where are they now?

1:03:20.008 --> 1:03:22.678
Where is that family now?

1:03:22.845 --> 1:03:24.847
Tell me where the Red Room is.

1:03:27.182 --> 1:03:29.977
-I have no idea.
-

1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:31.228
ALEXEI: Okay?

1:03:36.275 --> 1:03:37.860
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

1:03:37.943 --> 1:03:39.027
-Dreykov?
-Yeah.

1:03:39.111 --> 1:03:41.530
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

1:03:42.114 --> 1:03:44.032
Gives me glory...

1:03:44.199 --> 1:03:47.202
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

1:03:47.369 --> 1:03:50.539
I could have been more famous
than Captain America.

1:03:50.706 --> 1:03:54.126
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

1:03:54.293 --> 1:03:55.711
Three years!

1:03:55.878 --> 1:03:58.839
So tedious, boring me to tears.

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.260
No offense, huh?

1:04:04.261 --> 1:04:06.763
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:08.307
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

1:04:08.473 --> 1:04:11.143
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

1:04:11.310 --> 1:04:12.895
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

1:04:12.978 --> 1:04:14.229
and I say something casually about that.

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:15.397
Maybe, you know,

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:17.524
I want the Party
to feel actually like a party

1:04:17.691 --> 1:04:20.068
instead of this sourpuss organization.

1:04:20.861 --> 1:04:22.404
But instead, no.

1:04:22.779 --> 1:04:25.574
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

1:04:25.741 --> 1:04:27.868
He just runs off and hides, huh?

1:04:28.410 --> 1:04:31.788
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

1:04:33.957 --> 1:04:35.792
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

1:04:37.169 --> 1:04:38.921
Can we throw him
out the window now?

1:04:39.087 --> 1:04:41.006
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

1:04:41.089 --> 1:04:42.090
All right.

1:04:44.927 --> 1:04:45.969
Wait, Mom Melina?

1:04:46.136 --> 1:04:48.138
-We thought she was dead.
-

1:04:48.222 --> 1:04:51.016
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

1:04:51.183 --> 1:04:52.351
-Ew.
-ALEXEI: What?

1:04:52.893 --> 1:04:57.105
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

1:04:57.272 --> 1:04:59.775
She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.

1:04:59.858 --> 1:05:03.403
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?

1:05:03.570 --> 1:05:05.822
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

1:05:05.906 --> 1:05:07.741
Uh...

1:05:08.075 --> 1:05:10.661
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

1:05:10.827 --> 1:05:12.412
No, we're good. We'll make it.

1:05:13.038 --> 1:05:14.039
Okay.

1:05:34.059 --> 1:05:36.603
You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.

1:05:40.774 --> 1:05:42.734
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

1:05:42.901 --> 1:05:44.736
-I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

1:05:45.237 --> 1:05:46.822
ALEXEI: Natasha.

1:05:46.989 --> 1:05:48.365
Natasha. Natasha.

1:05:48.532 --> 1:05:51.451
Come here, I want to ask you something.

1:05:51.618 --> 1:05:53.537
-Come, it's important.
-What?

1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.626
Did he talk to you about me?

1:06:00.878 --> 1:06:02.004
What?

1:06:02.754 --> 1:06:06.175
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

1:06:06.341 --> 1:06:07.342
Who? What are you talking about?

1:06:07.509 --> 1:06:09.761
Captain America.

1:06:09.928 --> 1:06:14.892
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.894
Not so much a nemesis.

1:06:16.977 --> 1:06:18.979
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

1:06:19.146 --> 1:06:21.356
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

1:06:21.523 --> 1:06:23.567
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

1:06:23.734 --> 1:06:25.277
and you're gonna ask me about you?

1:06:26.528 --> 1:06:28.572
What is with this tension?

1:06:30.532 --> 1:06:31.825
Did I do something wrong?

1:06:33.452 --> 1:06:34.995
Is that a serious question?

1:06:36.246 --> 1:06:38.248
I only ever loved you girls.

1:06:38.874 --> 1:06:40.918
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

1:06:41.084 --> 1:06:42.920
to achieve your fullest potential,

1:06:43.003 --> 1:06:44.755
-and everything worked out.
-Everything worked out?

1:06:44.922 --> 1:06:47.299
Yes. For you, yes.

1:06:48.842 --> 1:06:51.428
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

1:06:52.012 --> 1:06:54.973
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

1:06:55.057 --> 1:06:56.350
the world has ever known.

1:06:56.517 --> 1:07:00.479
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

1:07:00.771 --> 1:07:02.606
And Natasha,

1:07:02.940 --> 1:07:07.653
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

1:07:07.819 --> 1:07:09.947
destroying empires from within,

1:07:10.531 --> 1:07:12.282
but an Avenger.

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:16.161
You both have killed

1:07:16.870 --> 1:07:18.705
so many people.

1:07:19.456 --> 1:07:22.960
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

1:07:23.502 --> 1:07:25.712
I couldn't be more proud of you.

1:07:30.175 --> 1:07:31.468
Okay. You can... No.

1:07:31.635 --> 1:07:33.387
Let go of me now.

1:07:33.554 --> 1:07:35.347
You smell really bad.

1:07:39.893 --> 1:07:42.229
So, are we there yet?

1:07:42.396 --> 1:07:44.439
You'll know when we're there.

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:48.151
-MELINA: Slight right.

1:07:49.486 --> 1:07:50.696
Straight on.

1:07:51.530 --> 1:07:52.531
Right.

1:07:55.117 --> 1:07:56.159
Slight right.

1:07:57.077 --> 1:07:59.496
Oh, very good, my darling.

1:08:00.664 --> 1:08:02.833
Yes, very good.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.086
-Yes, very good, my darling.
-

1:08:18.432 --> 1:08:21.727
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

1:09:10.234 --> 1:09:13.570
Honey, we're home.

1:09:24.748 --> 1:09:26.500
Come on, girls.

1:09:36.593 --> 1:09:39.304
Welcome to my humble abode.

1:09:39.930 --> 1:09:41.723
Make yourself at home.

1:10:00.951 --> 1:10:02.452
NATASHA: Hey, no funny business.

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:05.873
I am putting away my weapon.

1:10:29.605 --> 1:10:30.939
NATASHA: Are there
any booby traps around here?

1:10:31.023 --> 1:10:32.107
Anything we need to know about?

1:10:32.274 --> 1:10:33.901
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

1:10:34.067 --> 1:10:35.819
You didn't raise us at all.

1:10:37.905 --> 1:10:39.448
Oh, maybe so.

1:10:39.823 --> 1:10:43.118
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

1:11:05.599 --> 1:11:07.351
Let's drink.

1:11:09.228 --> 1:11:10.437
ALEXEI: Okay.

1:11:21.657 --> 1:11:22.991
Still fits.

1:11:24.535 --> 1:11:26.203
Oh, my God.

1:11:29.373 --> 1:11:30.624
MELINA: I never washed it once.

1:11:31.083 --> 1:11:32.376
Come and drink.

1:11:35.796 --> 1:11:38.340
Rise, you workers of salvation

1:11:41.426 --> 1:11:43.220
Family

1:11:43.929 --> 1:11:45.848
back together again.

1:11:46.431 --> 1:11:48.642
-Mmm.
-Seeing as our

1:11:48.725 --> 1:11:49.893
family construct

1:11:50.060 --> 1:11:52.855
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

1:11:53.063 --> 1:11:57.359
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

1:11:57.526 --> 1:11:59.987
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

1:12:00.153 --> 1:12:03.282
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

1:12:03.448 --> 1:12:04.533
And, uh...

1:12:05.284 --> 1:12:07.119
I want to say something
right off the bat.

1:12:07.494 --> 1:12:09.413
You haven't aged a day, huh?

1:12:09.580 --> 1:12:14.710
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

1:12:16.170 --> 1:12:17.671
MELINA: You got fat.

1:12:18.338 --> 1:12:20.966
-But still good.
-

1:12:21.550 --> 1:12:23.886
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

1:12:25.846 --> 1:12:27.347
-I have a lot of energy.
-MELINA: Oh!

1:12:27.723 --> 1:12:29.349
Please don't do that.

1:12:31.351 --> 1:12:33.437
So, here's what's gonna happen.

1:12:33.604 --> 1:12:35.022
Natasha, don't slouch.

1:12:35.939 --> 1:12:37.900
-I'm not slouching.
-MELINA: Yes, yes, you are.

1:12:37.983 --> 1:12:38.984
I don't slouch.

1:12:39.067 --> 1:12:40.194
You're going to get a back hunch.

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:41.612
-Listen to your mother.
-NATASHA: Oh, my God, this...

1:12:41.695 --> 1:12:42.696
Up, up.

1:12:42.779 --> 1:12:44.198
All right, enough. All of you.

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:46.116
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

1:12:46.283 --> 1:12:47.784
-Here's what's gonna happen...
-I don't want any food.

1:12:47.868 --> 1:12:49.953
MELINA: Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

1:12:50.037 --> 1:12:51.788
You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.

1:12:55.667 --> 1:12:58.504
You know, it's like when you told them

1:12:58.587 --> 1:13:00.714
that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

1:13:00.881 --> 1:13:02.966
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls.

1:13:03.050 --> 1:13:04.384
"Look out. Where is he?"

1:13:04.468 --> 1:13:07.346
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

1:13:07.513 --> 1:13:09.389
then you see he's there.

1:13:09.556 --> 1:13:11.433
No, no. What? I want them

1:13:11.517 --> 1:13:13.143
-to follow their dreams.
-MELINA: No good.

1:13:13.310 --> 1:13:15.354
ALEXEI: Reach for the stars, girls.

1:13:15.521 --> 1:13:18.023
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

1:13:18.190 --> 1:13:22.069
You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.

1:13:22.236 --> 1:13:26.114
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

1:13:26.281 --> 1:13:27.616
Nor did you.

1:13:30.244 --> 1:13:34.498
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

1:13:41.630 --> 1:13:42.631
Come in.

1:13:49.972 --> 1:13:51.515
Did that pig just open the door?

1:13:51.682 --> 1:13:53.767
Yes. It did.

1:13:53.934 --> 1:13:56.687
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

1:13:57.688 --> 1:13:59.481
You named a pig after me?

1:14:00.107 --> 1:14:01.859
You don't see the resemblance?

1:14:05.821 --> 1:14:07.281
See, he sits just like dog.

1:14:08.282 --> 1:14:09.700
Amazing. Now, watch.

1:14:09.867 --> 1:14:11.159
ALEXEI: It's a little weird, to me.

1:14:11.326 --> 1:14:12.828
Stop breathing.

1:14:18.208 --> 1:14:21.545
We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.

1:14:21.712 --> 1:14:23.255
It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

1:14:23.338 --> 1:14:26.592
Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.

1:14:26.758 --> 1:14:28.302
In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,

1:14:28.468 --> 1:14:31.346
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

1:14:31.513 --> 1:14:36.185
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

1:14:36.351 --> 1:14:37.769
Was the hub for cognition.

1:14:37.936 --> 1:14:41.231
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

1:14:42.900 --> 1:14:46.528
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

1:14:46.695 --> 1:14:49.531
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

1:14:55.370 --> 1:14:56.371
What are you doing?

1:14:56.496 --> 1:15:00.167
Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

1:15:00.334 --> 1:15:02.544
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

1:15:02.711 --> 1:15:04.588
and has no choice but to obey.

1:15:04.755 --> 1:15:06.256
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

1:15:06.423 --> 1:15:09.301
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

1:15:09.468 --> 1:15:12.054
11 more seconds without oxygen.

1:15:12.221 --> 1:15:15.015
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

1:15:16.558 --> 1:15:18.644
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

1:15:19.394 --> 1:15:21.063
Good boy, Alexei.

1:15:21.230 --> 1:15:24.858
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

1:15:25.025 --> 1:15:29.404
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

1:15:29.738 --> 1:15:31.698
And do you know who they test it on?

1:15:31.782 --> 1:15:33.116
MELINA: Hmm...

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:34.952
No. That's not my department.

1:15:35.035 --> 1:15:36.912
ALEXEI: Ah, come on, come on.

1:15:37.079 --> 1:15:38.956
-Don't lie to them. Hmm?
-I'm not lying.

1:15:39.122 --> 1:15:40.582
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

1:15:40.749 --> 1:15:41.750
MELINA: What were you?

1:15:41.834 --> 1:15:43.502
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

1:15:43.585 --> 1:15:44.628
You were his business partner.

1:15:44.711 --> 1:15:46.004
No, no, no. I was patsy!

1:15:46.088 --> 1:15:48.382
-Don't give me that...
-He sell me ideology.

1:15:48.549 --> 1:15:49.716
-Stop with the politics.
-All the while, bigger...

1:15:49.883 --> 1:15:52.678
Shut up! You are an idiot.

1:15:57.266 --> 1:15:58.767
And you're a coward.

1:16:01.186 --> 1:16:02.729
You're a coward.

1:16:02.896 --> 1:16:07.025
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

1:16:08.318 --> 1:16:09.820
We're moving on.

1:16:09.987 --> 1:16:12.322
ALEXEI: Never family, huh?

1:16:12.489 --> 1:16:15.158
In my heart, I am simple man.

1:16:16.076 --> 1:16:19.329
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

1:16:19.496 --> 1:16:21.540
I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?

1:16:21.832 --> 1:16:25.169
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

1:16:25.711 --> 1:16:28.005
Who cares? That wasn't real.

1:16:28.297 --> 1:16:30.716
-What?
-That wasn't real. Who cares?

1:16:30.883 --> 1:16:32.634
Don't say that.

1:16:33.177 --> 1:16:35.721
Please don't say that.
It was real.

1:16:36.471 --> 1:16:39.433
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

1:16:40.642 --> 1:16:42.352
You were my real mother.

1:16:42.519 --> 1:16:45.147
The closest thing I ever had to one.

1:16:46.273 --> 1:16:49.109
The best part of my life was fake.

1:16:50.611 --> 1:16:52.946
And none of you told me.

1:16:55.908 --> 1:16:58.035
And those agents

1:16:58.118 --> 1:17:00.829
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

1:17:02.414 --> 1:17:04.458
That was me.

1:17:06.752 --> 1:17:07.753
Mmm.

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:12.633
And you, you got out.

1:17:12.799 --> 1:17:15.177
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

1:17:16.011 --> 1:17:18.055
Are you gonna say anything?

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:22.601
No.

1:17:24.061 --> 1:17:25.062
Don't touch me.

1:17:28.398 --> 1:17:29.399
Yelena.

1:17:29.775 --> 1:17:30.984
No.

1:17:34.821 --> 1:17:37.324
-I had no idea.
-It's okay, it's okay.

1:17:37.491 --> 1:17:39.368
I'll go talk to her.

1:17:55.425 --> 1:17:57.928
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

1:17:59.638 --> 1:18:00.764
Okay.

1:18:01.807 --> 1:18:03.934
We, uh... We just sit.

1:18:08.772 --> 1:18:10.274
We just sit.

1:18:19.825 --> 1:18:20.993
Where are you going?

1:18:21.159 --> 1:18:23.495
-To do this myself.
-Don't. You won't survive.

1:18:23.662 --> 1:18:25.998
I wish I could believe that you cared.

1:18:26.832 --> 1:18:29.001
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:31.295
No, you weren't abandoned.

1:18:31.461 --> 1:18:33.422
You were selected by a program

1:18:33.505 --> 1:18:35.507
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

1:18:45.642 --> 1:18:47.144
I was taken?

1:18:47.603 --> 1:18:51.064
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

1:18:51.690 --> 1:18:54.109
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

1:18:54.276 --> 1:18:57.196
She was like you in that way.
She was

1:18:57.362 --> 1:18:58.906
relentless.

1:18:59.656 --> 1:19:01.283
What happened to her?

1:19:02.993 --> 1:19:04.745
Dreykov had her killed.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:08.874
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

1:19:09.917 --> 1:19:12.336
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:13.504
wouldn't warrant an execution,

1:19:13.670 --> 1:19:16.381
but, as I said, she was relentless.

1:19:19.134 --> 1:19:21.970
I thought about her every day of my life.

1:19:26.558 --> 1:19:29.394
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

1:19:31.855 --> 1:19:34.233
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

1:19:45.369 --> 1:19:46.870
Then why did you save this?

1:20:04.805 --> 1:20:06.723
I remember this day.

1:20:06.890 --> 1:20:10.853
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

1:20:11.478 --> 1:20:13.480
-Different backdrops.
-Mmm.

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:19.486
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

1:20:19.653 --> 1:20:21.321
I wanted to open every single one...

1:20:24.741 --> 1:20:27.536
so just for a second it would feel real.

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.496
Let's stop this.

1:20:37.045 --> 1:20:38.547
Why you doing this?

1:20:39.756 --> 1:20:43.635
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

1:20:43.802 --> 1:20:46.430
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

1:20:46.513 --> 1:20:49.099
four times before you were even born?

1:20:49.266 --> 1:20:50.684
Those walls are all I know.

1:20:51.435 --> 1:20:53.687
I was never given a choice.

1:20:54.104 --> 1:20:56.398
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

1:20:58.901 --> 1:21:02.029
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

1:21:06.074 --> 1:21:08.952
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

1:21:14.917 --> 1:21:17.085
Pain only makes us stronger.

1:21:18.086 --> 1:21:20.005
Didn't you tell us that?

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:24.426
What you taught me kept me alive.

1:21:28.138 --> 1:21:30.140
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

1:21:30.307 --> 1:21:32.267
They'll be here any minute.

1:21:35.395 --> 1:21:39.733
ALEXEI: So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

1:21:40.734 --> 1:21:42.945
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:44.404
Cold even for Russia, you know?

1:21:44.571 --> 1:21:47.324
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

1:21:47.491 --> 1:21:48.617
Please stop talking.

1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:49.743
-Please wait. Please wait.
-Please, no.

1:21:49.826 --> 1:21:50.827
Please, I don't want to talk.

1:21:50.911 --> 1:21:52.454
Please. Please.

1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:55.791
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

1:21:56.166 --> 1:21:58.460
I am reaching for fish.

1:21:59.962 --> 1:22:02.923
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

1:22:03.006 --> 1:22:04.007
Splash!

1:22:04.091 --> 1:22:06.009
-My hands go in the river.
-

1:22:06.093 --> 1:22:10.180
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

1:22:10.639 --> 1:22:14.351
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

1:22:14.518 --> 1:22:15.644
Oh, my God.

1:22:15.811 --> 1:22:20.607
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

1:22:20.774 --> 1:22:22.276
How is this relevant?

1:22:23.068 --> 1:22:24.361
You know,

1:22:24.862 --> 1:22:26.154
fathers.

1:22:28.699 --> 1:22:31.285
No. No.

1:22:31.952 --> 1:22:35.455
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

1:22:35.831 --> 1:22:39.835
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

1:22:40.210 --> 1:22:41.503
To me?

1:22:42.546 --> 1:22:44.756
To me, you were everything.

1:22:47.426 --> 1:22:50.804
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

1:22:51.305 --> 1:22:53.724
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

1:22:53.891 --> 1:22:57.144
as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

1:23:03.775 --> 1:23:05.652
It's the Red Guardian.

1:23:05.819 --> 1:23:06.904
Get out.

1:23:07.279 --> 1:23:08.864
Get out!

1:23:18.373 --> 1:23:20.876
I can't remember

1:23:23.962 --> 1:23:25.881
If I cried

1:23:28.091 --> 1:23:31.678
When I read about his widowed bride

1:23:32.679 --> 1:23:36.934
Something touched me deep inside

1:23:37.100 --> 1:23:38.268
The day

1:23:39.686 --> 1:23:42.231
The music

1:23:42.940 --> 1:23:44.483
Died

1:23:45.150 --> 1:23:47.694
-And they were singing
-

1:23:48.779 --> 1:23:50.906
-Bye
-Bye

1:23:51.073 --> 1:23:53.659
-Miss American Pie
-American Pie

1:23:53.825 --> 1:23:56.745
Drove my Chevy to the levee

1:23:56.912 --> 1:23:59.540
-But the levee was dry
-Was dry

1:24:00.457 --> 1:24:02.459
Them good old boys

1:24:02.918 --> 1:24:04.962
Drinking whiskey

1:24:06.588 --> 1:24:07.881
Singing

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:12.261
BOTH: "This will be the day that I die"

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.472
"This'll be the day..."

1:24:35.367 --> 1:24:36.368
Get down.

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:45.210
They think...

1:25:44.978 --> 1:25:46.438
I'm sorry.

1:25:47.856 --> 1:25:49.858
-

1:26:02.496 --> 1:26:04.540
Let's not keep him waiting.

1:26:30.899 --> 1:26:33.068
MELINA: Request clearance for landing.

1:26:35.612 --> 1:26:36.655
Melina?

1:26:41.535 --> 1:26:43.328
We're touching down in one minute.

1:26:43.495 --> 1:26:46.123
Then why are we still going up?

1:26:48.375 --> 1:26:51.795
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

1:28:11.458 --> 1:28:12.709
DREYKOV: My God.

1:28:17.381 --> 1:28:18.382
So, uh,

1:28:18.966 --> 1:28:20.592
how was the family reunion?

1:28:20.759 --> 1:28:22.636
Oh, it was awful.

1:28:22.803 --> 1:28:23.887
They were clingy,

1:28:23.971 --> 1:28:26.098
-and too emotional, and needy.
-

1:28:26.265 --> 1:28:28.642
-Just like old times, huh?
-Hmm.

1:28:28.725 --> 1:28:30.227
Yelena Belova.

1:28:30.394 --> 1:28:32.104
What's the deal with her?

1:28:32.271 --> 1:28:34.523
She was the only one affected, right?

1:28:34.690 --> 1:28:36.233
As far as I know, yes.

1:28:36.817 --> 1:28:39.361
These gasses and antidotes,

1:28:39.987 --> 1:28:42.614
it's a pain in my ass.

1:28:43.824 --> 1:28:46.159
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

1:28:46.243 --> 1:28:47.578
Hmm. I have nine pigs

1:28:47.661 --> 1:28:48.662
that will require attending to
in my absence.

1:28:48.829 --> 1:28:52.040
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

1:28:58.255 --> 1:28:59.506
Cut her brain out...

1:29:00.424 --> 1:29:03.010
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

1:29:12.561 --> 1:29:15.105
This is a much less cool way to die.

1:29:20.944 --> 1:29:22.863
-

1:29:24.072 --> 1:29:25.490
Alexei.

1:29:34.458 --> 1:29:36.001
MELINA: What about Romanoff?

1:29:36.168 --> 1:29:37.461
She's a traitor.

1:29:38.337 --> 1:29:42.424
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

1:29:43.425 --> 1:29:45.344
She had nothing.

1:29:45.511 --> 1:29:49.306
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

1:29:49.806 --> 1:29:52.100
Put that thing in her you do.

1:29:52.267 --> 1:29:54.353
You know, uh, chemicals.

1:29:55.395 --> 1:29:58.524
Turn her into one of your pigs.

1:29:59.107 --> 1:30:03.654
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

1:30:03.820 --> 1:30:06.281
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

1:30:06.448 --> 1:30:09.868
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

1:30:10.369 --> 1:30:13.413
no mask in the world can hide that.

1:30:27.302 --> 1:30:28.470
Welcome home.

1:30:30.472 --> 1:30:32.140
Now, now.

1:30:33.433 --> 1:30:35.602
Don't go breaking my new toy.

1:30:37.479 --> 1:30:38.772
Natasha.

1:30:41.066 --> 1:30:42.943
I can't save us.

1:30:43.861 --> 1:30:45.737
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

1:30:45.904 --> 1:30:47.781
-I pledged my life to a cause.

1:30:47.948 --> 1:30:50.284
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

1:30:50.450 --> 1:30:51.577
Possibly the bravest.

1:30:51.743 --> 1:30:54.246
But I wasn't being brave.

1:30:54.413 --> 1:30:55.956
I was coward.

1:31:01.837 --> 1:31:03.213
In Cuba,

1:31:04.756 --> 1:31:07.050
when they came
and took you away from me...

1:31:08.385 --> 1:31:10.929
No cause is worth that.

1:31:13.390 --> 1:31:15.851
You should only sacrifice yourself

1:31:16.727 --> 1:31:18.270
-for something...
-

1:31:26.111 --> 1:31:27.988
How did you do that?

1:31:28.780 --> 1:31:31.033
I designed these cells myself.

1:31:34.203 --> 1:31:35.412
What?

1:31:37.247 --> 1:31:38.248
What?

1:31:38.749 --> 1:31:42.127
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

1:31:42.294 --> 1:31:45.881
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1:31:46.465 --> 1:31:49.051
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

1:31:49.218 --> 1:31:52.179
You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.

1:31:52.346 --> 1:31:53.347
What?

1:31:56.517 --> 1:31:58.519
What are you going to do to me?

1:31:59.853 --> 1:32:00.854
MELINA: Outside right hip.

1:32:07.402 --> 1:32:08.904
-

1:32:28.549 --> 1:32:30.217
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1:32:30.300 --> 1:32:31.385
MELINA: Don't throw a fit.

1:32:31.552 --> 1:32:32.845
-There wasn't time.
-Okay, girls,

1:32:32.928 --> 1:32:34.179
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1:32:34.263 --> 1:32:37.140
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

1:32:37.558 --> 1:32:41.979
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

1:32:42.646 --> 1:32:45.566
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1:32:45.732 --> 1:32:47.776
You don't have earpiece.

1:32:48.485 --> 1:32:49.486
What?

1:32:49.653 --> 1:32:50.779
No, she can't hear you.

1:32:50.946 --> 1:32:52.364
-You don't have earpiece.
-Why not?

1:32:52.531 --> 1:32:53.824
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1:32:53.991 --> 1:32:55.534
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1:32:56.243 --> 1:32:57.327
NATASHA: So, once we're inside,

1:32:57.411 --> 1:32:58.996
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1:32:59.496 --> 1:33:02.666
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1:33:03.250 --> 1:33:05.627
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1:33:06.795 --> 1:33:10.090
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1:33:10.257 --> 1:33:12.926
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1:33:13.093 --> 1:33:14.511
we can descend within the hour.

1:33:14.595 --> 1:33:16.263
Ah, problem.

1:33:16.430 --> 1:33:19.016
I only have one earpiece set.

1:33:19.808 --> 1:33:20.934
I'll give it to Yelena.

1:33:21.602 --> 1:33:22.686
Where did he take the vials?

1:33:22.853 --> 1:33:24.771
MELINA: Probably down to cold storage.

1:33:24.938 --> 1:33:27.274
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,

1:33:27.441 --> 1:33:30.027
so you have to expose them
to this antidote.

1:33:30.444 --> 1:33:33.405
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1:33:34.823 --> 1:33:35.908
Is this your plan?

1:33:36.366 --> 1:33:37.701
My plan is to kill you.

1:33:37.868 --> 1:33:39.286
I'm alive.

1:33:40.370 --> 1:33:42.122
So, what do we do now?

1:33:43.415 --> 1:33:45.501
What was my mother's name?

1:33:49.087 --> 1:33:50.172
Ah...

1:33:51.215 --> 1:33:53.342
Where we buried her,

1:33:53.967 --> 1:33:55.844
there was a tree...

1:33:56.470 --> 1:33:57.888
Um...

1:33:58.305 --> 1:33:59.848
A pink blossom.

1:34:00.265 --> 1:34:01.725
Beautiful.

1:34:01.892 --> 1:34:03.644
And there was a tombstone

1:34:03.810 --> 1:34:06.438
with her name engraved on it.

1:34:07.231 --> 1:34:08.732
What was her name?

1:34:12.653 --> 1:34:16.031
"Unknown."

1:34:18.075 --> 1:34:20.369
You don't feel anything?

1:34:21.620 --> 1:34:23.914
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1:34:24.081 --> 1:34:27.334
Is this your haunted past?

1:34:40.973 --> 1:34:43.642
Thank you, Natasha.

1:34:47.896 --> 1:34:50.482
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1:34:54.236 --> 1:34:55.320
Say hello.

1:35:10.544 --> 1:35:13.005
When your bomb exploded,

1:35:13.172 --> 1:35:15.716
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1:35:19.469 --> 1:35:23.307
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1:35:23.473 --> 1:35:25.809
In the back of her neck.

1:35:26.226 --> 1:35:28.187
Look at her.

1:35:28.687 --> 1:35:30.898
You find it difficult to look at her?

1:35:31.815 --> 1:35:33.150
I do.

1:35:34.026 --> 1:35:36.653
She... She watches everything

1:35:37.529 --> 1:35:38.739
and she can do it.

1:35:39.281 --> 1:35:41.325
She's a perfect mimic.

1:35:43.410 --> 1:35:46.246
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1:35:50.918 --> 1:35:52.503
Can she hear me?

1:35:55.881 --> 1:35:57.090
What?

1:35:59.176 --> 1:36:01.303
You want to make her feel better?

1:36:03.263 --> 1:36:05.933
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1:36:07.267 --> 1:36:11.146
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1:36:13.148 --> 1:36:15.692
But enough of all this bullshit.

1:36:17.027 --> 1:36:18.153
Go to work.

1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:20.364
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1:36:22.908 --> 1:36:24.159
Go.

1:36:35.754 --> 1:36:37.339
Well, that was a mistake.

1:36:38.006 --> 1:36:39.091
Was it?

1:36:39.591 --> 1:36:42.636
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1:36:44.388 --> 1:36:45.389
Try, then.

1:36:45.556 --> 1:36:46.765
Do it.

1:36:51.562 --> 1:36:53.063
Is the safety on?

1:36:58.151 --> 1:36:59.152
No.

1:37:02.990 --> 1:37:04.825
-Try your knife.
-

1:37:05.701 --> 1:37:06.785
DREYKOV: Ah...

1:37:13.792 --> 1:37:14.877
You're in trouble.

1:37:15.043 --> 1:37:16.378
How are you controlling me?

1:37:16.545 --> 1:37:18.589
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1:37:19.256 --> 1:37:20.632
Well, not yet.

1:37:21.258 --> 1:37:23.427
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:28.182
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1:37:32.728 --> 1:37:35.397
I'm very upset with Melina.

1:37:35.564 --> 1:37:37.441
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1:37:38.150 --> 1:37:39.776
ALEXEI: Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:41.695
press buttons and hack computers...

1:37:41.862 --> 1:37:42.863
MELINA: Yes.
ALEXEI: I mean, I don't know.

1:37:42.946 --> 1:37:43.947
There's nothing for me to do.

1:37:44.072 --> 1:37:46.867
I want to...
I want to break something.

1:37:46.950 --> 1:37:47.951
-Oh, you do?
-

1:37:49.703 --> 1:37:52.331
Oh, there is something you can break.

1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:09.932
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1:38:12.017 --> 1:38:13.769
Ah, damn it.

1:38:26.615 --> 1:38:28.575
That was disgusting.

1:38:41.964 --> 1:38:43.131
Okay.

1:39:04.903 --> 1:39:07.656
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1:39:07.990 --> 1:39:12.870
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1:39:16.248 --> 1:39:17.708
Oh, no, no, no.

1:39:22.462 --> 1:39:26.550
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1:39:26.717 --> 1:39:27.718
Pathetic, huh?

1:39:27.885 --> 1:39:29.553
Yeah, what would you call it?

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:30.888
-I would call it...
-When was the last time

1:39:30.971 --> 1:39:32.347
that you had a conversation with somebody

1:39:32.431 --> 1:39:34.266
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1:39:34.433 --> 1:39:37.394
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1:39:37.811 --> 1:39:41.315
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1:39:41.481 --> 1:39:43.066
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1:39:43.233 --> 1:39:44.443
You hid in the dark.

1:39:44.610 --> 1:39:48.405
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1:39:48.572 --> 1:39:50.991
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1:39:51.325 --> 1:39:52.492
You're nothing.

1:39:52.576 --> 1:39:54.786
-Hmm.
-You have nothing.

1:39:55.287 --> 1:39:56.872
There are 50 people on this planet...

1:39:57.039 --> 1:39:58.290
Oh, stop it.

1:39:58.457 --> 1:40:01.084
Don't tell me to stop!

1:40:01.251 --> 1:40:04.171
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1:40:08.133 --> 1:40:09.259
Come on.

1:40:09.426 --> 1:40:11.261
Think I can't take a punch?

1:40:11.345 --> 1:40:12.429
-DREYKOV: Oh.
-

1:40:14.264 --> 1:40:17.434
-God damn it, you're weak.
-Weak?

1:40:17.601 --> 1:40:19.770
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1:40:19.937 --> 1:40:21.563
-DREYKOV: That's enough.
-

1:40:31.657 --> 1:40:33.283
DREYKOV: You wouldn't be so glib

1:40:33.450 --> 1:40:37.120
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1:40:38.747 --> 1:40:41.333
I own this world. Me.

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:43.252
You seem desperate to impress me.

1:40:43.418 --> 1:40:44.753
I don't need to impress you.

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:47.422
I don't need to impress anyone.

1:40:48.632 --> 1:40:51.802
These world leaders, these great men,

1:40:52.636 --> 1:40:55.472
they answer to me and my widows.

1:40:59.226 --> 1:41:00.310
Look at them.

1:41:03.105 --> 1:41:04.815
These girls were trash.

1:41:05.941 --> 1:41:08.026
They are thrown out into the street.

1:41:08.485 --> 1:41:11.780
I recycle the trash.

1:41:11.947 --> 1:41:13.824
And I give them purpose.

1:41:15.659 --> 1:41:17.452
I give them a life.

1:41:24.668 --> 1:41:26.920
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1:41:28.297 --> 1:41:30.299
MELINA: I've had a slight setback.

1:41:32.384 --> 1:41:34.094
You'll need to get to the widows.

1:41:53.363 --> 1:41:55.199
DREYKOV: It's my network of widows

1:41:55.282 --> 1:41:58.410
that help me control the scales of power.

1:41:58.744 --> 1:42:02.831
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1:42:02.998 --> 1:42:07.085
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1:42:07.252 --> 1:42:10.380
My widows can start and end wars.

1:42:10.631 --> 1:42:13.342
They can make and break kings.

1:42:17.346 --> 1:42:19.890
You control all of that from here?

1:42:20.641 --> 1:42:22.518
And with you,

1:42:23.185 --> 1:42:26.230
an Avenger under my control,

1:42:27.606 --> 1:42:30.067
I can finally come out of the shadows

1:42:31.193 --> 1:42:35.948
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1:42:37.533 --> 1:42:38.909
Girls.

1:42:49.211 --> 1:42:51.588
All from that little console?

1:42:52.339 --> 1:42:53.549
DREYKOV: Yeah.

1:42:57.886 --> 1:42:59.638
Oh, you find this amusing?

1:42:59.930 --> 1:43:01.473
Why are you smiling?

1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:04.184
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1:43:06.478 --> 1:43:08.564
Thank you for your cooperation.

1:43:09.022 --> 1:43:13.235
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1:43:13.485 --> 1:43:15.946
you won't be able to take it from him.

1:43:16.113 --> 1:43:19.491
For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1:43:19.658 --> 1:43:21.493
in all widows, even me.

1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:26.248
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1:43:26.331 --> 1:43:28.041
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1:43:28.208 --> 1:43:29.668
Not enough.

1:43:29.835 --> 1:43:31.545
This is basic science.

1:43:31.712 --> 1:43:34.965
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1:43:35.132 --> 1:43:37.176
you have to sever the nerve.

1:43:39.011 --> 1:43:40.345
I can handle that.

1:43:41.263 --> 1:43:43.640
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1:43:44.516 --> 1:43:46.268
I'll have to finish it myself.

1:43:46.351 --> 1:43:48.395
What are you going to do?

1:43:50.355 --> 1:43:51.648
Sever the nerve.

1:44:15.047 --> 1:44:16.465
Melina!

1:44:27.809 --> 1:44:29.394
Precisely what I was thinking.

1:44:42.074 --> 1:44:43.867
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1:44:44.034 --> 1:44:47.329
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1:44:50.374 --> 1:44:51.375
YELENA: Fantastic.

1:44:51.542 --> 1:44:53.043
I'm heading to the widows now.

1:44:54.253 --> 1:44:55.546
No.

1:45:33.166 --> 1:45:34.751
MELINA: We have to go.

1:45:40.090 --> 1:45:42.718
Not so talkative now, are you?

1:45:44.386 --> 1:45:45.470
You took my childhood.

1:45:47.097 --> 1:45:49.641
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1:45:49.808 --> 1:45:51.852
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:06.867
DREYKOV: Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1:46:07.034 --> 1:46:09.203
Make her suffer.

1:46:11.413 --> 1:46:12.831
I don't wanna hurt you.

1:46:13.415 --> 1:46:14.833
You don't wanna hurt me.

1:48:08.864 --> 1:48:10.073
YELENA: Hey.

1:48:10.449 --> 1:48:11.450
-Are you okay?

1:48:12.743 --> 1:48:13.869
That looks like it hurts.

1:48:14.036 --> 1:48:16.246
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1:48:16.455 --> 1:48:18.415
-I'm sorry.

1:48:24.004 --> 1:48:26.173
Get as far away
from here as possible.

1:48:27.132 --> 1:48:28.717
You get to make your own choices now.

1:48:39.770 --> 1:48:40.979
We gotta get outta here.

1:48:41.146 --> 1:48:42.231
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1:48:42.314 --> 1:48:43.524
I'm right behind you.

1:48:50.239 --> 1:48:53.534
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1:49:13.887 --> 1:49:14.972
-

1:49:33.824 --> 1:49:34.825
Yes!

1:50:32.090 --> 1:50:33.509
Do you see the girls?

1:50:36.386 --> 1:50:37.387
No!

1:51:10.254 --> 1:51:11.839
We need to go back.

1:51:39.157 --> 1:51:40.784
MELINA: We've lost control.

1:52:04.892 --> 1:52:06.310
Antonia.

1:52:12.608 --> 1:52:14.318
I'm gonna open the door.

1:52:15.110 --> 1:52:16.945
You're gonna come after me.

1:52:17.112 --> 1:52:19.323
It's okay. It's okay.

1:52:21.450 --> 1:52:23.619
I know you're still in there.

1:52:25.537 --> 1:52:28.457
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1:53:42.865 --> 1:53:43.866
Yelena!

1:53:45.409 --> 1:53:46.910
She's on the wing!

1:53:47.077 --> 1:53:49.454
Move! What are you waiting for?

1:53:50.998 --> 1:53:51.999
Don't do it!

1:53:52.958 --> 1:53:54.626
This was fun!

1:53:54.793 --> 1:53:55.836
No!

1:55:43.986 --> 1:55:45.320
Okay.

1:55:46.530 --> 1:55:48.031
Let's go.

1:56:02.838 --> 1:56:04.089
Enough.

1:56:55.474 --> 1:56:56.892
I'm sorry.

1:56:57.059 --> 1:56:58.477
I'm sorry.

1:57:01.688 --> 1:57:03.273
Is he gone?

1:57:07.694 --> 1:57:09.071
He's gone.

1:57:26.713 --> 1:57:28.090
Yelena!

1:57:38.934 --> 1:57:40.227
Yelena?

1:57:46.942 --> 1:57:49.152
We're both upside down.

1:58:04.168 --> 1:58:05.460
I should've come back for you.

1:58:05.627 --> 1:58:06.795
You don't have to say that.

1:58:06.879 --> 1:58:08.172
-It's okay.
-Hey. Hey.

1:58:08.714 --> 1:58:10.299
It was real to me, too.

1:58:24.563 --> 1:58:25.564
YELENA: Thank you.

1:58:40.662 --> 1:58:41.788
Everybody good?

1:58:41.955 --> 1:58:44.374
I am clearly injured.

1:58:45.792 --> 1:58:47.711
You got something to say?

1:58:48.670 --> 1:58:50.088
I'd just mess it up.

1:59:04.436 --> 1:59:06.355
Here comes the cavalry.

1:59:09.358 --> 1:59:11.777
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1:59:14.488 --> 1:59:16.448
So, what's our plan?

1:59:17.366 --> 1:59:19.952
You guys go. I'll stay.

1:59:20.118 --> 1:59:22.079
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1:59:22.162 --> 1:59:24.039
NATASHA: I'll hold them off.
ALEXEI: Natasha, we fight.

1:59:24.122 --> 1:59:25.666
MELINA: We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1:59:25.832 --> 1:59:28.001
-NATASHA: You guys, go.
-Oh, my God.

1:59:28.168 --> 1:59:30.921
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1:59:31.088 --> 1:59:33.507
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1:59:33.674 --> 1:59:34.967
Little bit.

1:59:35.133 --> 1:59:39.054
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1:59:39.221 --> 1:59:41.765
I know how much you like it.

1:59:41.932 --> 1:59:43.725
-NATASHA: Shucks.
-

1:59:43.809 --> 1:59:45.060
It does have a lot of pockets.

1:59:45.227 --> 1:59:47.229
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1:59:48.355 --> 1:59:50.524
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1:59:50.691 --> 1:59:52.568
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1:59:53.110 --> 1:59:54.903
but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

2:00:14.756 --> 2:00:16.675
You came back for us.

2:00:25.350 --> 2:00:26.810
Thank you.

2:00:31.857 --> 2:00:33.108
MELINA: Hey.

2:00:33.775 --> 2:00:36.570
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

2:00:36.737 --> 2:00:37.863
Don't worry. I got this.

2:00:38.030 --> 2:00:39.489
I know.

2:00:49.875 --> 2:00:52.794
MELINA: Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

2:00:53.504 --> 2:00:55.797
Come. Come with us.

2:02:30.475 --> 2:02:31.602
You ever not sleep?

2:02:32.769 --> 2:02:36.148
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

2:02:36.315 --> 2:02:37.608
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

2:02:37.774 --> 2:02:40.235
What, are you scrapping together
some parts?

2:02:40.402 --> 2:02:43.947
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

2:02:49.119 --> 2:02:51.413
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

2:02:57.419 --> 2:02:59.046
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

2:02:59.213 --> 2:03:01.840
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

2:03:03.091 --> 2:03:04.259
I'm impressed.

2:03:04.426 --> 2:03:06.094
Well, yeah.

2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:09.348
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

2:03:09.515 --> 2:03:12.017
That's what every man wants to hear.

2:03:12.809 --> 2:03:13.977
Where you gonna go?

2:03:15.312 --> 2:03:17.981
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

2:03:18.148 --> 2:03:20.317
Turns out I got two, so...

2:03:20.817 --> 2:03:22.110
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

2:03:22.277 --> 2:03:25.072
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

2:03:25.572 --> 2:03:28.075
see if I can't help patch things up.

2:12:39.585 --> 2:12:41.920
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

2:12:44.423 --> 2:12:47.259
What this woman did,

2:12:47.426 --> 2:12:50.262
honestly, I can't even imagine.

2:12:50.762 --> 2:12:54.516
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

2:12:54.683 --> 2:12:56.185
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

2:12:56.268 --> 2:12:58.812
I'm just here paying my respects.

2:12:58.896 --> 2:12:59.980
YELENA: Hmm...

2:13:00.397 --> 2:13:02.691
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

2:13:02.774 --> 2:13:05.194
-

2:13:06.028 --> 2:13:07.070
Okay.

2:13:07.237 --> 2:13:08.322
I want a raise.

2:13:08.488 --> 2:13:09.823
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

2:13:09.990 --> 2:13:12.451
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

2:13:13.619 --> 2:13:15.913
I've got your next target.

2:13:16.079 --> 2:13:17.831
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

2:13:20.083 --> 2:13:24.880
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

2:13:27.633 --> 2:13:29.593
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
