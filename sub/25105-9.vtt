00:14.199 --> 00:15.668
<i>That's where she comes in.</i>

00:15.701 --> 00:17.837
<i>Her name is Mara Kint.</i>

00:17.870 --> 00:21.852
<i>Her job: find the lost ones
and bring them home.</i>

00:22.180 --> 00:24.576
<i>And maybe, by saving them,</i>

00:24.727 --> 00:28.247

- What kind of danger?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.655
Losing your mind.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.897
Is Oliver right?
Am I... am I gonna go crazy?

00:45.930 --> 00:48.380
Oliver was unstable
long before he got a BCI.

00:48.434 --> 00:49.711
- Stop!
- [gunshot]

00:49.841 --> 00:51.138

Bruising caused by
a virtual gunshot wound.

00:53.614 --> 00:55.083
I told you that we needed safeguards.

00:55.116 --> 00:56.585
And now I'm agreeing with you.

00:56.617 --> 00:57.986
I'm really sorry by the way that

00:58.019 --> 00:59.632
I didn't return your calls.

00:59.657 --> 01:01.064
The calls I made 19 months ago?

01:02.524 --> 01:04.453
<i>Can we talk later?</i>

01:04.759 --> 01:07.462
- What do you want?
- I want my company back.

01:07.494 --> 01:08.529
Not gonna happen.

01:08.563 --> 01:09.931
And Dylan is?

01:09.964 --> 01:11.700
He's the building's AI.

01:11.732 --> 01:14.835
Dylan, say hello to Ms. Kint.

01:14.869 --> 01:16.004
<i>Hello, Ms. Kint.</i>

01:16.036 --> 01:17.377
I was talking to Dylan.

01:17.402 --> 01:19.708
He mentioned things you and he did
when you were little.

01:19.741 --> 01:21.610
He was her brother. They were twins.

01:21.643 --> 01:23.782
Must have been about 10 or 11
when he died.

01:23.807 --> 01:25.547
You sure you understand
what you have to do?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.783
It's not complicated.

01:29.149 --> 01:30.518
Mara, what's happening?

01:30.551 --> 01:32.501
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

01:33.087 --> 01:35.305
I'm here for a reason, Mara.

Tell me what happened.

01:54.476 --> 01:56.510
I got a call from Chris yesterday.

01:56.544 --> 01:57.912
Where were you?

01:57.946 --> 01:59.513
I was at work.

01:59.547 --> 02:01.417
Was anyone with you?

02:03.818 --> 02:06.755
Then he came
to the apartment last night.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.998
And I talked to him this morning.

02:17.599 --> 02:20.702
And when I came home...

02:22.102 --> 02:23.705
He was here.

02:26.140 --> 02:30.633
And then the real Chris called.

02:30.883 --> 02:34.633
And then the Chris here

02:35.517 --> 02:37.618
glitched and then...

02:39.921 --> 02:41.524
He turned into Ray.

02:41.588 --> 02:43.592
- Ray?
- Her brother-in-law.

02:43.624 --> 02:45.693
Oh, God, what is happening to me?

02:45.726 --> 02:48.389
You listen to me. You are safe.

02:48.414 --> 02:49.864
- We're gonna work this out...
- Don't.

02:49.898 --> 02:51.500
Don't you tell me

02:51.533 --> 02:53.360
that everything is going to be okay

02:53.407 --> 02:56.329
because I did everything that you said.

02:56.368 --> 02:59.007
I did everything you said
would make me okay,

02:59.102 --> 03:01.576
and I am not.

03:05.946 --> 03:09.392
I don't even know
if any of you are real.

03:09.896 --> 03:11.031
Mara.

03:11.152 --> 03:13.691
The first time you saw Chris,

03:14.039 --> 03:16.142
did you call him?

03:16.324 --> 03:19.494
- Or did he call you?
- He called me.

03:20.261 --> 03:22.631
You can't call a derealization.

03:23.765 --> 03:27.284
A phone call goes through
to the real person.

03:27.601 --> 03:30.838
You called us. We're here.

03:30.872 --> 03:32.846
We're real.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.562
And we're going to help you, I promise.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.344
I don't know if you can.

03:40.781 --> 03:42.983
[cell phone rings]

03:43.017 --> 03:45.189
Whoever that is, can you just tell them

03:45.214 --> 03:47.955
- that I can't talk right now?
- Sure.

03:50.925 --> 03:52.626
Hello?

03:52.660 --> 03:54.162
She's not available right now.

03:54.195 --> 03:55.964
How can I help you?

03:58.131 --> 03:59.667
What?

04:01.602 --> 04:03.203
I don't understand.

04:03.237 --> 04:04.806
Where?

04:07.207 --> 04:08.843
What?

04:10.712 --> 04:13.048
We're going to the hospital.

04:13.081 --> 04:15.317
EMTs brought him
in a couple of hours ago.

04:15.349 --> 04:18.719
He collapsed at a restaurant.
We can't find anything wrong.

04:18.753 --> 04:20.622
There's no apparent illness or injury.

04:20.654 --> 04:23.190
There's no signs of drug or alcohol use.

04:23.224 --> 04:24.993
We just can't wake him up.

04:25.026 --> 04:28.484
There's no ID, no emergency contact.

04:29.063 --> 04:30.788
Do you know his name?

04:30.964 --> 04:32.788
Oliver Hill.

04:33.267 --> 04:35.155
Was this with him?

04:35.370 --> 04:38.773
- Yes.
- Why did you call me?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.581
When a patient arrives unconscious,

04:40.621 --> 04:42.886
we try to get in touch
with someone who knows him.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.813
What makes you think he knows Mara?

04:44.846 --> 04:46.047
Well, there was a message.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.279
Wha... what are you talking about?

04:48.304 --> 04:50.118
What kind of message?

04:55.899 --> 04:58.113
_

05:00.918 --> 05:02.854
[sirens wailing]

05:08.902 --> 05:10.860
Do it.

05:10.938 --> 05:12.931
- This is illegal you know.
- Uh-huh.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.960
He wakes up, files a report,

05:14.985 --> 05:17.811
we're charged with kidnapping,
unlawful detention,

05:17.844 --> 05:20.347
- among other things.
- I'll risk it.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.017
I pulled every string I have
to get him released to us.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.299
Now that he's here
I'm not taking any chances.

05:25.323 --> 05:28.526
Nobody gets in this room
unless I know about it.

05:28.551 --> 05:29.853
You got it.

05:29.886 --> 05:31.588
He got his hands on a BCI,

05:31.621 --> 05:33.590
which means somebody here
stole it for him.

05:33.622 --> 05:35.224
I want to know who.

05:40.095 --> 05:41.008
You've got first watch.

05:41.033 --> 05:43.735
No one in except Ventana and me, clear?

05:43.995 --> 05:47.099
Sure. I'll keep an eye on him.

05:49.338 --> 05:51.073
If I send you the file right now,

05:51.107 --> 05:53.177
could you look at it in the next hour?

05:54.438 --> 05:55.974
Thanks.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.516
That was a neurologist in Toronto.

05:59.549 --> 06:01.284
Says she can be here tomorrow morning

06:01.316 --> 06:03.252
- to look at Mara if we want.
- Think she can help?

06:03.285 --> 06:05.897
Honestly? I don't know.

06:06.164 --> 06:08.934
I'm just trying everything
I can think of.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.461
- Is Oliver here?
- In the medical unit.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.376
Paul said you met with him.

06:15.589 --> 06:17.869
He wasn't supposed to tell you that.

06:17.908 --> 06:19.745
What about?

06:19.778 --> 06:21.013
Mara came out of a Reverie

06:21.045 --> 06:23.247
with a bruise from a virtual injury.

06:23.281 --> 06:25.893
Oliver had mentioned the
possibility when he was here.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.838
- I wanted his opinion.
- His opinion?

06:29.290 --> 06:31.734
I thought you said you never
wanted to hear his name again.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.759
I didn't.

06:33.792 --> 06:37.154
I don't. It's complicated.

06:37.329 --> 06:40.300
You're divorced,
I'd think you'd understand.

06:40.350 --> 06:44.451
Well, Lizette and I went
a few rounds when we split up.

06:44.836 --> 06:47.708
She never tried to burn down my house.

06:47.872 --> 06:50.408
Alexis, Oliver is brilliant,

06:50.933 --> 06:53.480
insane, and royally pissed off at us.

06:53.598 --> 06:54.619
He's planned something.

06:54.689 --> 06:57.369
I don't know what it is,
but it's bad news.

06:57.449 --> 06:59.185
Stay away from him.

07:00.918 --> 07:02.386
Charlie.

07:02.420 --> 07:06.324
He's angry at us because we hurt him.

07:06.358 --> 07:07.992
He's hurt.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.129
That's what I'm scared of.

07:20.872 --> 07:22.941
Did you get any sleep?

07:22.973 --> 07:24.203
Some.

07:24.257 --> 07:25.276
Liar.

07:25.490 --> 07:28.092
Look, even if we don't know
what's causing the issues

07:28.117 --> 07:29.350
we can treat the symptoms.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.318
We can start with
more powerful psychotropics.

07:31.352 --> 07:33.421
It didn't work before.
Why would it work now?

07:33.559 --> 07:35.528
Another option is
mindfulness techniques.

07:35.553 --> 07:37.891
You're offering me meditation?

07:37.924 --> 07:39.893
I know.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.561
Sorry, I wish I had better.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.498
Paul, has anything like this
ever happened to anyone before?

07:44.530 --> 07:46.132
Not like this, no.

07:46.165 --> 07:49.569
Then I'm not surprised
you don't have a cure.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.204
You said that

07:51.237 --> 07:54.242
Chris transformed
into your brother-in-law.

07:54.275 --> 07:56.463
That sort of spontaneous transformation

07:56.488 --> 07:58.479
of a derealized figure is rare.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.148
Did he do anything when he was Ray?

08:01.181 --> 08:04.979
He said something
similar to what Brynn told me.

08:05.004 --> 08:06.119
What?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.600
That he was there for a reason.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.590
- What reason?
- Well, I would like to know.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.259
Alexis is talking to a neurologist.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.194
We're hoping she'll be able to help.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.798
She probably doesn't know
more about the BCI

08:16.859 --> 08:19.630
or the program than you all do,
so what's the point?

08:20.501 --> 08:23.169
I'm gonna go into Reverie
myself and talk to Oliver.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.638
- What?
- Are you kidding?

08:24.672 --> 08:27.073
Everyone's always telling me
how brilliant he is,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.591
and he's lived through
what I'm going through.

08:28.616 --> 08:31.186
Yeah, wasn't the same thing at all.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.381
Close enough.

08:33.414 --> 08:36.116
Maybe he knows something.

08:36.150 --> 08:37.919
Besides, he wants to talk to me.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.089
<i>Apertus.</i>

08:43.121 --> 08:44.492
[computer beeps]

08:50.130 --> 08:51.795
Kint!

08:56.737 --> 08:58.673
Amazing, isn't it?

09:02.041 --> 09:06.413
Just a bunch of ones and zeroes
playing tricks on our brain.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.251
But it sure is beautiful.

09:11.777 --> 09:14.379
Too bad it drives you mad, huh?

09:15.990 --> 09:18.957
If it drives you mad, why are you here?

09:19.325 --> 09:22.162
To be honest, I missed it.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.597
Plus, you know, things to do,
people to see.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.434
All right, you asked me here.
What do you want?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.471
Alexis told me you were having trouble.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.105
A bruise from a virtual wound.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.441
Actually, yes.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.275
But that... that's the least of it.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.678
Derealizations? Are they getting worse?

09:37.711 --> 09:38.746
Yes.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.681
That's why I asked you here.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.016
I can help.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.050
I want to propose an exchange.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.319
You help me. I help you.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.455
Help you with what?

09:48.488 --> 09:51.157
I want you to ask Alexis to
meet me here in the program.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.560
I can't ask her myself, obviously.

09:53.585 --> 09:55.201
If I even tried to get near her again,

09:55.226 --> 09:56.576
Charlie would take my head off,

09:56.601 --> 09:58.169
and I don't mean metaphorically.

09:58.194 --> 10:01.001
He would literally [pops lips]
remove my head.

10:01.035 --> 10:05.006
Okay, you understand why that would be

10:05.053 --> 10:08.208
a very bad idea to a lot of people.

10:08.242 --> 10:09.926
I just want to talk to Alexis

10:09.951 --> 10:12.213
without Charlie looking
over my shoulder.

10:12.363 --> 10:16.097
A private moment in the
world we built together.

10:16.757 --> 10:19.727
I know we're not going
to have a relationship again.

10:19.925 --> 10:23.247
But I've been punished,
and I'm remorseful.

10:23.424 --> 10:25.520
And that's got to mean something.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.778
I just want the chance
to explain myself to her.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.551
That's all that matters to me.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.400
How exactly can you help me?

10:33.434 --> 10:35.860
You want your sanity back,

10:36.118 --> 10:37.806
you just have to remove
that bloody little thing

10:37.837 --> 10:40.485
they stuck in your head, the BCI.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.108
Now, they'll tell you
they can deactivate it,

10:42.141 --> 10:43.343
but that's not good enough.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.146
It's got to be cut out, like a tumor.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.248
And then you leave Onira-Tech.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.482
You walk out that door,

10:49.508 --> 10:53.278
and you never ever, ever look back.

10:58.816 --> 11:00.885
Can you do it?

11:01.253 --> 11:04.223
Just take the BCI out?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.100
Um, it's called emergency extraction.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.270
It's quick and painless,
but we almost never do it.

11:10.304 --> 11:12.706
We prefer to leave the BCI
in place and deactivate it.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.809
If the client really wants
to be rid of it,

11:14.842 --> 11:17.477
the body simply reabsorbs it
in about six months.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.227
But why not just take it out?

11:20.252 --> 11:22.016
If we extract the BCI,

11:22.041 --> 11:23.583
it leaves scar tissue at the site

11:23.617 --> 11:24.963
in the brain where it implants.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.254
We can never put another one in.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.989
You're permanently locked out
of the program.

11:33.774 --> 11:35.208
Oh.

11:35.273 --> 11:36.775
Look, let's deactivate.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.532
It's a good first step, and it
allows us to keep exploring.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.636
I don't want to keep exploring.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.179
If taking the BCI out is the
only way to make this stop...

11:55.582 --> 11:57.730
Then that's exactly what I want to do.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.754
You're sure?

12:00.205 --> 12:01.707
Yes, I am.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.125
All right.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.095

13:12.879 --> 13:14.782
After I heard Oliver's message,

13:14.815 --> 13:16.188
I asked Dylan to let me know

You're not seriously considering

Why exactly would you want to do that?

13:34.727 --> 13:36.136
He's going to stay in there

13:36.170 --> 13:38.339
until his body goes
into medical distress.

13:38.372 --> 13:40.741
Then we'll have to go in there
and talk to him anyway.

You expect me to believe

14:39.865 --> 14:41.835
Well first off,
those flowers aren't limp.

If the program were just

they'd be crazy.

Meaningful.

Maybe the BCI is causing your problem.

If it is, rip it out,
throw it on the floor

16:07.423 --> 16:08.562
and jump up and down on it.

16:08.587 --> 16:10.515
But I think the program is uncovering

16:10.540 --> 16:11.953
something hidden in your mind,

16:11.978 --> 16:14.147
and if that's true, removing the BCI

16:14.172 --> 16:16.196

the Reverie program right now?

24:24.691 --> 24:27.829
<i>27,423.</i>

24:30.564 --> 24:32.801
And what are the odds
that one of those people

24:32.833 --> 24:34.168
is going to need help?

24:34.202 --> 24:36.004
<i>A problem arises with approximately</i>

24:36.036 --> 24:38.606
<i>one in every 12,000 users.</i>

24:38.639 --> 24:40.140
So there's probably somebody
in trouble right now,

24:40.174 --> 24:41.943
but we just haven't heard about it yet?

24:41.975 --> 24:44.679
<i>2.28 people, actually.</i>

25:07.506 --> 25:10.076
Jamie called me at
about 2:00 that afternoon.

25:15.109 --> 25:18.732
She and Ray had been married
for 8 years.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.943
He was okay.

25:21.349 --> 25:24.552
He drank a little bit more
than I liked, but...

25:25.801 --> 25:27.903
I didn't really think
there was a problem.

25:27.928 --> 25:30.497
[tires screeching]

25:30.625 --> 25:33.662
Some people when they're
falling apart, they...

25:36.063 --> 25:37.765
They give off signals.

25:37.799 --> 25:40.802
Other people just keep
a really tight lid on.

25:40.834 --> 25:44.238
And you don't know until it's too late.

25:47.975 --> 25:49.276
That was Ray.

25:49.326 --> 25:51.178
[tires screech]

25:51.212 --> 25:52.781
- Charlie.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

25:52.813 --> 25:54.648
My brother-in-law's got
my sister and my niece.

25:54.681 --> 25:56.181
Um, he has at least one gun on him.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.204
<i>- What's the address?</i>
- 1175 Arlington.

25:58.229 --> 26:00.296
Apartment 3A. [breathing heavily]

26:00.321 --> 26:02.157
<i>Got it. You gonna talk to him?</i>

26:02.189 --> 26:04.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but no...

26:04.698 --> 26:06.260
No flashers or guns when you get here.

26:06.293 --> 26:08.028
Okay?

26:08.062 --> 26:09.598
Why no sirens?

26:09.630 --> 26:12.668
Some people get
really worked up by them.

26:14.668 --> 26:17.572
I want them to calm down, to...

26:19.907 --> 26:22.778
make them think that I'm on their side.

26:25.346 --> 26:27.705
To get in their heads.

26:28.079 --> 26:29.915
So you can manipulate them.

26:37.516 --> 26:39.753
That's the idea.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.841
Okay, so just back up a second,

26:41.963 --> 26:44.799
and tell me how all of this got started.

26:44.831 --> 26:47.340
- I found a text.
- A text, good. What text?

26:47.365 --> 26:48.802
On Jamie's phone.

26:48.835 --> 26:50.838
A text on Jamie's phone.
Okay, great, great.

26:50.871 --> 26:51.973
What did it say?

26:52.006 --> 26:54.808
That's she's taking Brynn
to your parents' place,

26:54.841 --> 26:57.745
- she's gonna leave me...
- No, Ray, I was never...

26:57.779 --> 26:59.247
- Shut up!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.317
Wait, wait, wait, Ray.
Stay with me now, all right?

27:02.350 --> 27:05.219
Jamie, let me talk to him. Ray, listen.

27:05.253 --> 27:07.088
I'm sure it wasn't permanent, you know?

27:07.120 --> 27:11.225
Maybe she was just trying
to give you guys some space.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.853
I know my sister. She loves you.

27:13.895 --> 27:16.898
- Not anymore.
- Of course she does.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.668
You know, remember when you
used to come over to our house

27:19.700 --> 27:21.368
and you would pick her up for dates

27:21.401 --> 27:22.903
and you were driving that car,
what was it?

27:22.950 --> 27:26.241
It was the, um... it was
the... the black one

27:26.273 --> 27:28.443
- with the wheels.
- The Camaro.

27:28.475 --> 27:31.879
Oh, God, the Camaro. Exactly.

27:31.912 --> 27:34.682
He was listening.

27:37.385 --> 27:40.321
I... I could have...

27:40.353 --> 27:44.091
I could have grabbed
the gun away from him.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.760
We could have...

27:45.793 --> 27:47.262
[sobbing]

27:47.294 --> 27:49.690
We could have just walked away.

27:50.965 --> 27:53.333
[sirens wailing]

27:53.367 --> 27:56.096
- Did you call the police?
- Mara.

27:56.337 --> 27:58.873
No, no. No, I... I...

27:58.906 --> 28:00.175
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, I told you

28:00.214 --> 28:01.949
- not to call the police.
- They're gonna go away.

28:01.975 --> 28:04.279
- No, I didn't. They're gonna go away.
- I told you not to call them.

28:04.312 --> 28:06.045
No, no, no, Ray, Ray.

28:06.070 --> 28:07.107
- No!
- They're gonna go away.

28:07.148 --> 28:08.382
I'm gonna make them go away.

28:08.416 --> 28:09.751
- No, Ray, Ray.
- Please, please, please!

28:09.783 --> 28:11.988
- [gunfire]
- Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

28:13.365 --> 28:16.603
And there was nothing that I could do.

28:17.088 --> 28:20.081
And then Ray took the gun
and pulled it on himself.

28:22.062 --> 28:23.164
[gunshot]

28:23.196 --> 28:25.065
He couldn't even do that right.

28:25.099 --> 28:26.501
[laughing]

28:26.533 --> 28:29.169
The bullet went through
the front of his brain.

28:29.203 --> 28:30.972
It didn't kill him.

28:33.069 --> 28:35.905
He just ended up in a coma
for the rest of his life.

28:41.783 --> 28:45.087
What part of that is
the program digging up?

28:46.127 --> 28:48.463
Mr. Haskins, Oliver has
a piece of technology

28:48.488 --> 28:49.990
he stole from us.

28:50.023 --> 28:52.526
I've seen no proof
my client has stolen anything.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.095
I'll find the proof.

28:54.128 --> 28:56.539
Until you do,
you'll leave Mr. Hill alone.

28:56.564 --> 28:58.099
Given the way he's been treated today,

28:58.131 --> 29:00.936
you're lucky I'm not filing
charges with the police.

29:02.335 --> 29:04.538
So you can't touch me, Charlie.

29:04.571 --> 29:06.941
Yes, I can, Oliver.

29:07.833 --> 29:08.976
Just give me time.

29:09.010 --> 29:11.479
You always think
you're in control, don't you?

29:11.512 --> 29:13.982
It's your identity.

29:14.014 --> 29:16.383
But what if...

29:16.417 --> 29:18.485
[clears throat] I'm in control now?

29:18.518 --> 29:20.454
- [elevator dings]
- Hmm?

29:23.429 --> 29:24.998
See ya.

29:31.085 --> 29:34.952
Did Ray say anything to you
after he shot Jamie and Brynn?

29:35.366 --> 29:36.971
No.

29:37.054 --> 29:39.363
Did he say anything
before he shot himself?

29:39.407 --> 29:41.894
Uh... no.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.817
So, what did you do
until the police came?

29:48.850 --> 29:50.918
I stood there. I cried.

29:50.952 --> 29:52.287
And you're sure that's all?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.121
[exhales]

29:54.155 --> 29:55.490
Uh...

29:55.523 --> 29:58.426
I don't know. Maybe? Yeah.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.327
I don't know what you expect
from this, Paul.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.129
What's going on here?

30:02.162 --> 30:05.098
Paul thinks that the derealizations have

30:05.131 --> 30:06.567
something to do with Brynn and Jamie.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.137
- He has this theory...
- I know his theory.

30:09.169 --> 30:11.238
He's told me all about it.

30:11.272 --> 30:13.174
I didn't think he was going to
beat you over the head with it.

30:13.206 --> 30:15.443
We're just trying
to unearth something, Charlie.

30:15.475 --> 30:16.878
You're wasting your time.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.612
It's a valid hypothesis.

30:18.646 --> 30:20.549
You're wasting your time.

30:22.049 --> 30:24.552
Because you don't really know
what happened that day.

30:26.219 --> 30:28.188
Come up to my office.

30:28.222 --> 30:30.058
I'll tell you the truth.

30:33.609 --> 30:35.399
I thought about this a lot

30:35.424 --> 30:37.160
over the past couple of years.

30:37.235 --> 30:41.440
Told myself I should never
share this with you.

30:43.437 --> 30:46.273
Told myself I absolutely had to.

30:46.306 --> 30:48.909
You're really freaking me out, Charlie.

30:48.943 --> 30:50.144
What is on your phone?

30:50.177 --> 30:54.009
That day, I texted you in the apartment.

30:54.034 --> 30:55.283
You remember?

30:55.315 --> 30:57.150
All right, all right, all right, buddy.

30:57.184 --> 30:59.254
- [yells]
- [plate shatters]

30:59.286 --> 31:00.388
Yes.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.023
You texted me back.

31:02.055 --> 31:04.057

- Ray, they're gonna go away.

31:04.091 --> 31:06.427
<i>...you accidently called my phone.</i>

31:06.459 --> 31:08.028
- [sirens wailing]
- Did you call the police?

31:08.062 --> 31:10.738
By then my phone was in my pocket.

31:10.993 --> 31:12.676
It went to voicemail.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.773
My voicemail

31:15.969 --> 31:20.476
recorded everything your phone
transmitted from the apartment.

31:21.042 --> 31:23.743
I'm sorry you have to hear this.

No, that...

31:55.367 --> 31:57.504
That's not what happened.

31:58.916 --> 32:02.119
He didn't say anything
before he shot himself.

32:02.248 --> 32:04.141
Look, I know that's what you believe.

32:04.351 --> 32:07.522
I know because that's
what you told me afterward.

32:09.442 --> 32:11.846
And I could tell...

32:13.178 --> 32:15.214
You thought you were telling the truth,

32:15.325 --> 32:17.027
but it wasn't.

32:17.130 --> 32:21.272
No, Charlie, I... I was there.

32:21.557 --> 32:23.159
He didn't speak.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.118
It's common for trauma victims

32:25.238 --> 32:27.212
to suppress memories.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.448
You know that.

32:29.532 --> 32:30.954
That's why I kept this.

No one would have blamed you, Mara.

33:53.494 --> 33:55.696
I'd have killed him myself
with my bare hands
