00:44.155 --> 00:48.555
Gentlemen, crack open a fresh pack of
rubber pantaloons - we have a problem.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.633
We're picking up a ship heading straight for
us in an unmapped region of deep space.

00:53.796 --> 00:55.013
Where?

00:55.014 --> 00:59.481
Here in "Region Uncharted Sector No-Name"
quadrant "Nameless".

01:02.599 --> 01:04.998
Message incoming!

01:05.899 --> 01:10.568
I'm seeking J.M.C. Second Technician
Arnold Judas Rimmer.

01:10.569 --> 01:14.074
Keep it zipped. Say nothing.
Sound-wise we're going commando, people.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.008
That's him there!

01:17.174 --> 01:20.902
I cracked, sorry guys.
I tried to stay strong but he broke me!

01:20.903 --> 01:24.876
Second Technician Rimmer,
I understand you have a crewman

01:24.877 --> 01:27.204
who falls under your jurisdiction,

01:27.205 --> 01:29.005
a David Lister.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.739
Right there, Bud!

01:32.240 --> 01:34.966
Sorry guys.
He broke me again!

01:34.967 --> 01:38.237
Wh-what do you expect?!
I'm not made of concrete!

01:38.238 --> 01:41.985
I am Combat Droid 4,
of Batch 27.

01:41.986 --> 01:45.827
We wish to conduct a transaction
of goods with you.

01:45.828 --> 01:48.833
But you're simulants - you despise humans.
Why would you want to trade with us?

01:48.834 --> 01:53.273
You have something we want, and we
have something you want.

01:53.274 --> 01:53.981
What?

01:53.982 --> 01:57.800
A hostage, taken from a
human transport ship.

01:57.801 --> 01:59.808
Allow me to show you.

01:59.809 --> 02:02.661
We cannot negotiate with simulants.

02:02.662 --> 02:05.409
We cannot cave in to their insane demands.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.214
Under no circumstances
are J.M.C. personnel

02:08.215 --> 02:10.720
permitted to negotiate with the enemy.

02:10.721 --> 02:12.727
Guys, it's me!!!

02:12.728 --> 02:15.095
They've taken me hostage!
You've gotta help me!!

02:16.749 --> 02:18.652
Of course, that's what the J.M.C. think,

02:18.653 --> 02:21.186
but who the hell listens to
those pen pushers?

02:23.168 --> 02:25.034
Here are our demands,

02:25.035 --> 02:27.235
One second,
we need a moment.

02:28.625 --> 02:32.075
What's going on here? Is that me?!?
How can it be me? I'm here!

02:32.076 --> 02:34.216
There are a number of options, Sir.

02:34.217 --> 02:37.417
All involving you,
and all extremely bad.

02:37.761 --> 02:39.661
I'm all ears!

02:40.805 --> 02:44.144
Perhaps that person we saw,
is a different version of Mr. Rimmer -

02:44.145 --> 02:45.450
from an alternative dimension.

02:45.451 --> 02:47.654
So if he dies,
not the end of the world.

02:47.655 --> 02:52.630
Or, perhaps he's a clone of Mr. Rimmer,
produced, somehow, from his D.N.A.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.371
Again, if he dies,
not the end of the world.

02:54.372 --> 02:56.462
Or perhaps that man is you, Sir -

02:56.463 --> 03:00.486
A "you" seized from the future,
and taken back into the past.

03:00.487 --> 03:03.754
Again, if he dies -
not the end of the world!

03:07.684 --> 03:10.209
We've no choice.
We're gonna have to negotiate.

03:10.210 --> 03:13.503
But we never negotiate with the enemy.
Until today.

03:13.544 --> 03:17.032
Well, if that's the way they're going to roll,
let me handle negotiations.

03:17.033 --> 03:20.418
You think I'm going to leave the life of a
possible "future me" in your hands?!

03:20.419 --> 03:23.204
I've seen movies, Rimmer.
I know how to talk to hostage-takers.

03:23.205 --> 03:25.913
I've done J.M.C. crisis negotiation, Lister.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.272
I'm handling this, now get me a pad
and open coms!

03:29.273 --> 03:31.366
Okay, Arn.
We're working on the pad.

03:31.367 --> 03:34.234
But in return,
I'm going to need something from you.

03:34.603 --> 03:37.798
Wait a minute.
Are you just using your

03:37.799 --> 03:41.627
"hostage" negotiation techniques on me?
Just get me a damned pad!

03:41.628 --> 03:44.763
Okay, Arnold - we're working on the pad,
but you've got to realize,

03:44.764 --> 03:46.872
I can't pull a pad out of my ass
in five minutes -

03:46.873 --> 03:49.398
I've gotta talk to my boss,
they've gotta talk to their boss -

03:49.399 --> 03:51.599
they've gotta talk to the D.A.

03:53.688 --> 03:55.622
Here are my demands:

03:55.623 --> 03:59.323
In return for the whiny
human hologram man,

03:59.539 --> 04:03.357
You will give us the casket of Kronos,
which you salvaged from our

04:03.358 --> 04:06.336
abandoned attack ship,
the A.S. Anatos.

04:06.337 --> 04:08.634
The casket of what?!
What's that?

04:08.635 --> 04:12.494
It contains the essence of
23 of 27.

04:12.495 --> 04:15.928
I remember this - it's upstairs in the rec-room
underneath the pool table.

04:16.082 --> 04:18.482
For safe-keeping?
Nah - to keep the table level.

04:19.543 --> 04:20.743
Go and get it!

04:21.000 --> 04:26.601
Oh, man!  Now the pool table
is going to be all bend and wibbly again!!

04:30.585 --> 04:32.885
You have the casket of Kronos?

04:32.886 --> 04:34.594
How do we know you won't betray us?

04:34.595 --> 04:39.787
I am 4 of 27.
I am a warrior, and high-born.

04:39.788 --> 04:43.406
Who do you think I am?
3 of 63?

04:43.407 --> 04:46.572
3 of 63?
You're nothing like him.

04:46.573 --> 04:49.873
Then...
We trade.

04:54.668 --> 04:57.434
Now, what about the hostage?

04:59.199 --> 05:01.799
Wait!
I'm being taken hostage!

05:04.783 --> 05:07.438
I'm back!
Thank God!

05:07.439 --> 05:08.975
I was their hostage!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.798
I didn't think you were
ever going to save me!

05:10.799 --> 05:12.621
I was kinda hoping we weren't!

05:12.622 --> 05:14.574
You were gone two seconds!

05:14.575 --> 05:17.929
Two seconds for you,
but for me, it was hours.

05:17.930 --> 05:19.652
I over-heard what they were saying.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.568
That Kronos casket didn't
contain the spirit of anyone.

05:22.569 --> 05:27.292
It was an amplifier they needed to plug into
their temporal transporter to expand the beam.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.230
What?!?

05:28.231 --> 05:29.298
They're Expenoids.

05:29.299 --> 05:30.600
What the hell are Expenoids?!

05:30.601 --> 05:35.027
Droids capable of doubling their
transistor power every two years.

05:35.028 --> 05:40.208
They progressed so rapidly, they became a
threat to every living entity in the universe.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.225
What are they planing?

05:41.226 --> 05:43.360
To travel back into the past
to change the present.

05:43.361 --> 05:46.617
That's a bit old-hat, isn't it?
How many times have we seen that before?

05:46.618 --> 05:50.352
Expenoids are unemotional,
cold-hearted psychopaths.

05:50.353 --> 05:53.867
They will have no hesitation
using hackneyed old cliches -

05:53.868 --> 05:55.568
if it suits their purpose.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.545
If they've come back into the past to
screw around with human evolution,

05:59.546 --> 06:01.159
How come I'm still here?

06:01.160 --> 06:03.427
Maybe you didn't qualify!

06:04.597 --> 06:07.539
Look at the scanner.
They're accelerating!

06:07.540 --> 06:10.560
Preparing to time-jump!
We need to get after them,

06:10.561 --> 06:13.737
stop whatever they're doing,
and get that Kronos machine back.

06:13.738 --> 06:16.612
So we can utilize it's time-travel
abilities ourselves?

06:16.613 --> 06:17.316
No.

06:17.317 --> 06:20.183
So we can prop the pool table back up!

06:21.014 --> 06:26.681
We haven't a second to lose - If we hurry,
we can time-surf on their slipstream.

06:39.531 --> 06:40.836
Planet up ahead.

06:40.837 --> 06:43.237
I'm detecting some kind
of electron wavelet,

06:43.274 --> 06:45.241
...approaching at speed!!

06:48.050 --> 06:49.247
We've lost navigation!

06:49.248 --> 06:50.708
And steering!

06:50.709 --> 06:51.513
And monitors!

06:51.514 --> 06:52.914
And meeeeeeee...

06:53.168 --> 06:55.535
I think what he was about to
say was we're both....

06:55.577 --> 06:57.477
All the electrics are down!

06:57.478 --> 06:58.779
What the hell's happening?!?

06:58.780 --> 07:00.810
We're crashing!
That's what the hell's happening!

07:00.811 --> 07:02.026
Now brakes!?!

07:02.027 --> 07:04.573
Do you think this is a good time to
make a crack about my teeth?

07:04.574 --> 07:06.074
Brakes!!

07:50.357 --> 07:54.390
Kryten couldn't be more fried
if he was a Mars bar living in Scotland.

07:54.655 --> 07:55.955
Rimmer is out too.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.875
Every cloud...!

07:58.651 --> 08:00.337
What the hell happened?!?

08:00.338 --> 08:04.383
We got hit by some sort of
electro-magnetic pulse weapon.

08:04.384 --> 08:08.009
It's taken out the grid,
and drained everything connected to it.

08:08.010 --> 08:11.810
We need to rebuild,
using the auxiliary drives!

08:15.945 --> 08:17.145
Jumpy's attached!

08:18.545 --> 08:21.112
I always forget which one is pos
and which one is negative.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.612
Don't get them mixed up, Bud.

08:30.613 --> 08:34.013
Or you'll wind up with nipples that
look like two barbecued-flavored nicknacks.

08:34.091 --> 08:36.191
Here goes nothing....

08:36.855 --> 08:39.488
Okay.
Start her up.

08:46.347 --> 08:48.052
Sir!
What happened?!?

08:48.053 --> 08:51.658
Kryten, stand up and walk up and down
really fast to recharge your dynamo.

08:51.659 --> 08:55.593
Get going!
And don't stop 'til you're fully charged.

08:55.597 --> 08:57.014
Close hatches!

08:57.015 --> 08:58.615
So embarrassing.

09:00.968 --> 09:02.295
What happened?!

09:02.296 --> 09:05.429
I think we got hit by
one of those P.M.T.'s!

09:06.921 --> 09:08.721
And where are the Expenoids?

09:08.761 --> 09:11.085
There's no sign of their ship
and there's no sign of them.

09:11.086 --> 09:12.612
Krytes - any theories?

09:12.613 --> 09:16.297
Well, according to the monitor,
they too landed here.

09:16.298 --> 09:18.417
But due to the curvature
of space-time,

09:18.418 --> 09:21.828
several years have elapsed
in the time it took us to get here.

09:21.829 --> 09:25.629
We've gotta find them,
and get that Kronos machine!

09:26.748 --> 09:29.195
Well, the vibrations in the light
that goes through here,

09:29.196 --> 09:33.296
tells us there's some kind of
township not far from here.

09:36.488 --> 09:37.643
Are we there yet?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.544
Not far now, Sirs.

09:42.227 --> 09:43.841
Real people?!

09:43.842 --> 09:46.533
I'm going to be seeing
real people again!

09:46.534 --> 09:47.977
Gas street lighting.

09:47.978 --> 09:51.195
Steam-powered right-hand
driving motor vehicles.

09:51.196 --> 09:56.073
Technology-wise, this time period doesn't
correlate with anything in my data base.

09:56.074 --> 09:59.541
Any theories, Krytes?
None at this juncture, Sir.

09:59.721 --> 10:02.354
Why do you always ask him
if he's got any theories?

10:02.355 --> 10:07.572
I'm acting, standing, commanding, senior,
premier officer - why do you never ask me?

10:07.573 --> 10:08.711
Maybe I've got a theory -

10:08.712 --> 10:10.402
Maybe I've got a really great theory,

10:10.403 --> 10:14.503
But you're always too busy asking him
to find out how great my theory really is.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.420
Okay.
Any theories, Rimmer?

10:17.421 --> 10:19.021
No!

10:19.995 --> 10:21.684
It's the principal.

10:21.685 --> 10:22.885
Look at that.

10:22.944 --> 10:25.677
Closed for violations of the
Prohibition Act.

10:25.737 --> 10:27.983
Prohibition?
That was the 1920s!

10:27.984 --> 10:32.707
Yeah. And alcohol was banned and
the bootleggers took over. Dark days.

10:32.708 --> 10:36.494
Society run by a bunch of hoodlum gangsters.
Dark days, indeed!

10:36.495 --> 10:38.662
I was thinking more about the booze ban.

10:38.716 --> 10:40.627
Whatever they're prohibiting
around there ain't booze.

10:40.628 --> 10:42.078
Look at that!

10:42.079 --> 10:43.997
Well, if it's not booze they prohibit, what is it?

10:43.998 --> 10:47.940
According to this leaflet,
the year is 1952!

10:47.941 --> 10:51.241
Nearly two decades after
prohibition ended!

10:59.475 --> 11:02.909
Well lookee here!
Illegal contraband.

11:09.603 --> 11:13.003
If that's the penalty for toast,
what the hell do you get for pizza?!

11:13.536 --> 11:16.879
It's not the toast that's illegal, Sir.
It's the technology.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.421
That's why the electro wavelet
shook down Starbug.

11:20.422 --> 11:24.789
Any technology beyond the
1920s is illegal around here.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.856
Unless, of course,
you're an Expenoid.

11:28.857 --> 11:32.057
The Expenoids haven't traveled
into the past to change the present,

11:32.058 --> 11:34.661
They traveled into the past
to enslave humanity!

11:34.662 --> 11:35.911
By doing what?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.719
By traveling into a point in history,

11:37.720 --> 11:39.672
where we haven't got the
technology to defeat them -

11:39.673 --> 11:41.506
or defend ourselves.

11:41.626 --> 11:44.581
And they plan for it to stay that way.
Hence the tech ban.

11:44.582 --> 11:47.378
A tech ban, which means you Sir, are illegal.

11:47.379 --> 11:48.607
He is?!

11:48.608 --> 11:52.378
I may move here -
lay down roots and start a family!

11:52.379 --> 11:54.188
He's not the only one who is illegal.

11:54.189 --> 11:56.289
So am I!!

11:58.150 --> 11:59.750
You know the penalty.

12:00.507 --> 12:01.707
Looks like they're gonna shoot them.

12:01.796 --> 12:02.996
Hey!

12:12.111 --> 12:14.011
Is he dead?
He's moaning.

12:14.117 --> 12:16.517
Can you blame him?
He's just been shot!!

12:17.565 --> 12:18.697
Did you see what happened?

12:18.698 --> 12:20.963
Yeah. We saw.
We'll get you a doctor.

12:20.964 --> 12:23.539
It's too late.
I ain't gonna make it.

12:23.540 --> 12:24.945
Here.

12:24.946 --> 12:28.146
Pizza delivery?
You want a pizza now?

12:28.787 --> 12:30.321
Oh, wrong pocket.

12:33.941 --> 12:35.808
The Lady Be Good Club.

12:37.170 --> 12:40.255
Here, ask for Harmony de Gauthier,

12:40.256 --> 12:42.256
and give her this...

12:45.324 --> 12:46.511
What is it?

12:46.512 --> 12:49.978
It appears to be some kind
of machine part, Sir.

12:53.402 --> 12:55.110
We've gotta get to this
Lady Be Good club.

12:55.111 --> 12:57.944
Dressed like this?!
We've gotta get some clothes!

13:11.957 --> 13:13.457
Have you done this before?

13:13.619 --> 13:15.243
It was the only way
to get home sometimes.

13:15.244 --> 13:18.165
When I lost all my money playing
Texas Hold 'em.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.665
I know it was wrong.
I was young.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.733
I was stupid. But what do you
really know when you're seven?

13:24.400 --> 13:28.867
Stealing cars at the age of seven?
Why didn't you take the bus?

13:29.294 --> 13:31.311
Hot wire a bus?
I was seven!

13:31.312 --> 13:32.436
Just wasn't up to it!

13:32.437 --> 13:35.874
Catching the bus- what's wrong with
catching the bus home from school?

13:35.875 --> 13:38.075
Who mentioned school?
I was off shoplifting.

13:38.868 --> 13:40.233
Don't look at me like that.

13:40.234 --> 13:42.434
Been on the straight and narrow
since I was nine.

13:43.047 --> 13:44.247
Ten.

13:44.734 --> 13:46.201
All right.
Eleven.

14:02.393 --> 14:03.660
This must be it.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.874
There's no buzzer.

14:05.875 --> 14:06.921
Tech Cap.

14:06.922 --> 14:11.427
Allow me, Sirs.  I am well-versed in the
ancient human signaling technique,

14:11.428 --> 14:15.370
that was all the rage before
electro-magnetism was discovered,

14:15.371 --> 14:17.590
and the electric buzzer took off.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.191
Now, if memory serves....

14:23.735 --> 14:24.935
We're out.

14:26.569 --> 14:27.769
I'll handle this.

14:27.803 --> 14:31.284
American's love the English accent,
so that rules out Lister.

14:31.285 --> 14:36.385
They're particularly impressed
by people who say "whom" a lot.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.217
I bid you good evening, stout fellow.

14:41.218 --> 14:45.824
My companions whom stand before you,
require information about a personage

14:45.825 --> 14:48.543
to whom I understand
frequents your establishment

14:48.544 --> 14:51.484
and who goes by the name
Harmony de Gauthier.

14:51.485 --> 14:54.585
Are whom acquainted with said lady?

14:55.897 --> 15:01.397
You been drinkin' the giggle water?
If you ain't members, beat it.

15:03.746 --> 15:05.868
Listen buddy,

15:05.869 --> 15:11.823
You know you got standing out here- not so cold
you could serve him up in a martini cocktail -

15:11.824 --> 15:16.724
Lucky - no middle name - Listerano!

15:18.580 --> 15:22.213
Ain't you got no lugs?
I said "blow".

15:22.577 --> 15:24.371
Wait...
Listerano?

15:24.372 --> 15:28.238
He ain't related to the scientist
Joseph Lister, is he?

15:28.239 --> 15:31.339
Uncle Joe?
Of course I am.

15:32.351 --> 15:35.351
Straight down the stairs -
first to the left.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.306
What is this place?

15:51.702 --> 15:54.513
It appears to be
some sort of elicit science club,

15:54.514 --> 15:58.625
a place where bootleg professors and
astrophysicists get together

15:58.626 --> 16:03.222
to create illegal tech and discuss
outlawed scientific theories.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.707
You boys want company?

16:04.708 --> 16:07.088
We're looking for a Harmony de Gauthier.

16:07.089 --> 16:11.389
Hey Harm - there's a bunny here
wants to get acquainted.

16:12.608 --> 16:14.211
So, uh, you want to grab a drink first

16:14.212 --> 16:18.145
or you wanna go somewhere
quiet to discuss relativity?

16:18.688 --> 16:21.688
For an extra $10, I'll do both -
general and special.

16:23.094 --> 16:25.031
No, that's - that's not why I'm here.

16:25.032 --> 16:28.636
You into electrons?
Is that what pings your microwave?

16:28.637 --> 16:30.263
you want to watch me do the
double-slit test?

16:30.264 --> 16:34.464
and experience the probabilistic nature
of quantum mechanics?

16:35.262 --> 16:36.888
What?
No!

16:36.889 --> 16:39.308
Every guy likes particles
that turn into waves, right?

16:39.309 --> 16:43.275
Or maybe you're more in the mood for some
Copenhagen interpretation?

16:43.540 --> 16:45.961
You know what I"m talking about;
where sub-atomic events are only

16:45.962 --> 16:52.262
perceptible as in-deterministic physically discontinuous
transitions between discrete stationary states?

16:53.655 --> 16:56.382
No - we're not here to
do science with you, okay?

16:56.383 --> 17:00.516
I'll wear a tweed suit and sensible shoes
if that revs up your engine.

17:01.152 --> 17:02.373
We're here for something else.

17:02.374 --> 17:04.874
Hey, I don't do the Big Bang!

17:05.721 --> 17:07.820
That's Beryl.

17:11.671 --> 17:14.611
And if you're looking for
unified field theory, I ain't your gal.

17:14.612 --> 17:17.137
Look, we've been sent here
to deliver some gizmo.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.611
We got told you might help.

17:18.612 --> 17:20.082
This is the capacitor.

17:20.083 --> 17:24.683
If the cops get their mitts on this, we're
deader than Galileo's theory of tides.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.175
So who are you?

17:27.176 --> 17:29.687
Just some guys from the
future looking to help.

17:29.688 --> 17:31.432
So what does that thing do?

17:31.433 --> 17:33.180
It fits into this.

17:33.181 --> 17:36.114
But how, I don't know.
It's not my area.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.460
You were just keeping it safe.

17:37.461 --> 17:39.728
Exactly.
No one goes up there.

17:42.016 --> 17:43.216
So what does this thing do?

17:43.357 --> 17:45.869
It infiltrates the
electron wavelet and redirects it.

17:45.870 --> 17:48.875
Creates an E.M.P.
to destroy the Expenoids.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.309
You got it.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.661
Any clue how they go together?

17:51.662 --> 17:53.329
We're all theoretical.

17:54.045 --> 17:56.451
And all the scientists still active
have been driven underground -

17:56.452 --> 18:00.052
Nobody's exactly rah-rah
about getting sent to "Old Steamy."

18:00.371 --> 18:03.560
So there's no scientists around
who can put this thing together?

18:03.561 --> 18:07.034
Just the bums and palookas who fell apart
when they couldn't practice science.

18:07.035 --> 18:08.037
Where are they?

18:08.038 --> 18:10.138
They spend all day drinking themselves goofy.

18:10.199 --> 18:12.568
Einstein, Hubble, and Edison...

18:12.569 --> 18:15.660
but you only get phonus bolognus
out of those screwballs.

18:15.661 --> 18:18.095
They're spiflicating -
morning, noon, and night.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.330
Did you say Einstein
..as in Albert Einstein?

18:21.331 --> 18:24.820
Sure. He's half-goofy now -
screaming at people who aren't there.

18:24.821 --> 18:28.254
Walking around the park
pushing a pram full of string.

18:30.928 --> 18:34.795
He's got some theory about it,
but no one will listen.

18:34.995 --> 18:37.395
Pram theory?

18:39.761 --> 18:42.531
Einstein's one of the most brilliant
minds that ever lived.

18:42.532 --> 18:44.164
He can do anything.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.709
You think I'm just off the boat?

18:45.710 --> 18:47.263
Well, where will we find him?

18:47.264 --> 18:51.797
At this time? Probably on the corner
of Hope Street with the other blueys.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.745
Hey man,
is that your pram?

18:59.746 --> 19:01.058
Yes!

19:01.059 --> 19:04.159
Sir, allow me to
introduce myself...

19:04.411 --> 19:05.908
Who the hell are you?!

19:05.909 --> 19:09.921
Acting senior officer Arnold Rimmer
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

19:09.922 --> 19:12.906
I have to say at school,
I always loved the bit of science.

19:12.907 --> 19:14.907
Bunsen burners - brilliant!

19:14.922 --> 19:18.422
Dropping sodium into water -
all that fizzing marvelous!

19:20.014 --> 19:22.722
Oh, and congratulations on...
what was it again?

19:22.723 --> 19:24.730
The Theory of Relativity, Sir.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.603
The Theory of Relativity.

19:26.604 --> 19:29.704
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:29.799 --> 19:33.374
Of course! Of course.
In this world, he hasn't achieved anything.

19:33.375 --> 19:34.864
So how can he help us?

19:34.865 --> 19:36.403
He'll still be a genius.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.776
Whatever problem we give him,
he'll be able to solve.

19:38.777 --> 19:41.743
Come on - let's get Hiney the Winey
back to the Lady Be Good.

19:41.744 --> 19:44.891
This way, Sir.
My pram. My pram.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.936
You leave the string alone, yes?

19:46.937 --> 19:50.181
Don't take my string.
You leave my string alone, see?

19:50.182 --> 19:52.487
It will be fine, Sir.
It's very safe.

19:52.488 --> 19:54.093
My string...
We won't touch your string.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.027
My string.
It's your string.

19:56.276 --> 19:59.376
You mind getting him a steak
with string fries or something?

20:03.813 --> 20:05.357
Now here's the problem.

20:05.358 --> 20:07.258
We gotta get this into
this somehow.

20:07.269 --> 20:08.380
How?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.814
You think I know?

20:10.155 --> 20:12.155
I don't know.

20:12.941 --> 20:15.047
Yes you do.
And do you know why?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.662
Because you're a genius.
You can do this.

20:16.663 --> 20:17.873
I can do this?

20:17.874 --> 20:20.496
We realize electrics isn't
strictly Einstein's field,

20:20.497 --> 20:23.799
but we thought he was so incredibly brilliant,
he'd be able to figure it out!

20:23.800 --> 20:26.234
You ain't going to get nothin'
out of this gutter muncher.

20:26.235 --> 20:27.344
Oh, why not?

20:27.345 --> 20:29.878
'Cause this bird ain't Einstein!

20:31.015 --> 20:33.863
What - so he's just some old bum
who pushes around a pram full of string?!

20:33.864 --> 20:35.364
You've got it.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.983
We haven't been introduced.

20:37.984 --> 20:40.584
I am Bob the Bum.

20:44.337 --> 20:48.545
So, you want to know if
I can get this potato

20:48.546 --> 20:51.279
into this potato?

20:52.216 --> 20:54.349
I'll get right onto it.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.307
I didn't realize I was so brilliant!!

21:00.050 --> 21:01.656
Cops!
Coming down the alley!!

21:01.657 --> 21:03.124
It's a raid!!!!!

21:21.151 --> 21:22.746
Find something to do!!

21:22.747 --> 21:24.714
Don't look suspicious!

21:32.380 --> 21:34.047
It doesn't go there...

21:34.169 --> 21:35.926
How about there?

21:35.927 --> 21:38.427
I can do this!
I'm brilliant!

21:41.402 --> 21:43.299
Okay!
Everybody pipe down.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.523
Quiet!!
This is a raid.

21:45.524 --> 21:48.531
Hey, drinkin' and dancin'
ain't illegal - what's the beef?

21:48.532 --> 21:52.716
Harmony de Gauthier...
now that's one fancy stage name,

21:52.717 --> 21:56.217
But you ain't foolin' no one,
Professor Baldwin!!

21:57.254 --> 21:58.894
That's who you are, ain't it?

21:58.895 --> 22:02.837
A dirty no good scientist who'll discuss
theoretical physics with anyone

22:02.838 --> 22:06.238
so long as the funding's right!

22:07.367 --> 22:09.770
I'm outta the science game now, see?

22:09.771 --> 22:12.904
I ain't touched a Petri dish in months.

22:13.171 --> 22:15.538
How dense do you think I am?

22:15.544 --> 22:16.982
You really wanna know?

22:16.983 --> 22:19.450
Just divide your mass by your volume.

22:22.259 --> 22:23.068
Hey!

22:23.069 --> 22:24.987
What the hell happened to your face?

22:24.988 --> 22:26.704
Who?
Me?

22:26.705 --> 22:29.405
I went bobbing for apples
in a cement mixer.

22:31.453 --> 22:33.353
Sure you did.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.075
So what do ya do?

22:35.076 --> 22:37.709
I just play in the band, Mam.

22:38.168 --> 22:42.768
Oooh, and what about you?
Are YOU a scientist?

22:47.551 --> 22:50.184
Think a scientist can
tap dance like that?!

22:58.161 --> 22:59.166
Wait a minute!

22:59.167 --> 23:02.101
How come you're drinkin' out of a
Erlenmeyer flask?

23:02.331 --> 23:04.033
Dey been doin' science!!

23:04.034 --> 23:06.101
You're busted!!!

23:11.235 --> 23:13.773
We nailed a couple of
white coats, Boss.

23:13.774 --> 23:16.482
We think they know something about
this screwy contraption machine

23:16.483 --> 23:19.783
the Resistance bunnies been
working on to whack you guys.

23:23.254 --> 23:25.554
So, we meet again.

23:25.760 --> 23:29.027
You really don't mind the
hackneyed old cliche, do ya?

23:31.553 --> 23:34.953
You know we're really not
so different, you and I.

23:36.770 --> 23:39.303
Now you're taking this, Mech.

23:39.530 --> 23:40.839
What is it you want?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.941
Human beings,
in the distant future,

23:42.942 --> 23:45.345
realized that humanity
wasn't mature enough

23:45.346 --> 23:47.038
to handle modern technology,

23:47.039 --> 23:51.116
and so we were created to prevent
that version of the future

23:51.117 --> 23:53.251
from ever happening.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.918
We are the good guys here.

23:57.464 --> 23:58.901
But you kill people!

23:58.902 --> 24:02.802
No one said that we couldn't have
a little fun along the way.

24:04.087 --> 24:07.082
So what happens to us?
Are you going to kill us, too?

24:07.083 --> 24:12.683
I wasn't planning to, but you know -
that's a really good idea.

24:13.509 --> 24:15.366
You're gonna kill us in cold blood?!

24:15.367 --> 24:17.335
Actually human blood isn't cold.

24:17.336 --> 24:20.136
It's around 37.5 degrees centigrade.

24:21.615 --> 24:24.549
Prepare to die, human scum.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.773
You said you were a high-born!
A droid of distinction!

24:27.774 --> 24:29.608
A real big spender!!

24:30.934 --> 24:32.728
So much better than
that other droid -

24:32.729 --> 24:34.298
..what was his name?

24:34.299 --> 24:35.506
3 of 63.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.007
Did someone say my name?

24:39.448 --> 24:41.328
Ah! So you're 3 of 63?

24:41.329 --> 24:42.640
What of it?

24:42.641 --> 24:45.441
Nothing.
Just don't say anything.

24:46.971 --> 24:48.279
We're good now.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.280
He was slagging you off
behind your back!!

24:50.770 --> 24:51.672
What?!?

24:51.673 --> 24:55.157
Look, just leave it, 3 of 63.
It's not worth it.

24:55.158 --> 24:59.092
No, no - you were slagging me off
behind my back?!?

24:59.781 --> 25:03.381
Look, you remember we were going
through that bad patch?

25:03.523 --> 25:08.023
You're no better than 18 of 241.

25:11.497 --> 25:13.017
Two potato

25:13.018 --> 25:15.051
makes one potato!!!!

25:19.492 --> 25:20.997
He did it!!!

25:20.998 --> 25:22.198
Bob!!

25:22.513 --> 25:24.028
You are brilliant!

25:24.029 --> 25:25.534
Just like you said!

25:25.535 --> 25:26.838
We don't have much time!

25:26.839 --> 25:29.284
This place will be swarming with
Expenoids in no time!!

25:29.285 --> 25:31.493
If I can hook this to the transmitter,

25:31.494 --> 25:34.163
we can send the signal world-wide
and wipe out all the mechs.

25:34.164 --> 25:35.878
Whoa-whoa-what about Kryten?!

25:35.879 --> 25:37.579
We have to detonate it,
there's no choice.

25:37.580 --> 25:38.587
No!!!

25:38.588 --> 25:41.165
Lister, don't you see?
Once the Expenoids are gone,

25:41.166 --> 25:42.572
you can stay here.

25:42.573 --> 25:44.428
We'll no longer be trapped together.

25:44.429 --> 25:45.973
I can't lose Kryten!

25:45.974 --> 25:46.988
Listen to me, Sir.

25:46.989 --> 25:50.595
Mr. Rimmer is speaking only about
what is best for you!

25:50.596 --> 25:53.452
As obviously,
detonating a global E.M.P.

25:53.453 --> 25:55.120
will destroy him, too!

25:57.297 --> 25:59.343
Hang on!
It's gonna take me out, too?!?

25:59.344 --> 26:00.585
Anything electrical.

26:00.586 --> 26:02.386
My straighteners?!?

26:02.639 --> 26:03.872
Hand over the E.M.P.

26:03.873 --> 26:06.542
I already detonated it while
you two were yackin'.

26:06.543 --> 26:08.643
You got 15 minutes to scram.

26:08.755 --> 26:10.655
LEG IT!!!!!

26:20.818 --> 26:22.218
We're 5 minutes from orbit.

26:22.871 --> 26:25.057
Activating the Kronos machine.

26:25.058 --> 26:28.266
Sir, we're going to hit
some turb at 3700 feet.

26:28.267 --> 26:30.016
Any chance we can go
a shorter route?

26:30.017 --> 26:31.297
Not according to Pythagoras.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.469
Yeah, well Pythagoras wasn't
much of a pilot.

26:34.470 --> 26:36.204
Leave this to me.

26:48.599 --> 26:50.549
I learned a few things today, Kryten.

26:50.550 --> 26:51.971
Huhm, really Sir?
What about?

26:51.972 --> 26:54.477
Well it seems to me that us humans
better be on our toes -

26:54.478 --> 26:56.281
make sure we don't
lose ourselves,

26:56.282 --> 26:58.031
and let technology take over.

26:58.032 --> 27:01.732
Mmm. I'll make a note, Sir, and remind you
if you ever appear to be in danger.

27:01.733 --> 27:02.435
Arms?

27:02.436 --> 27:04.803
Yeah.
Yeah, you do that.

27:04.897 --> 27:06.097
Shoe?

27:06.543 --> 27:08.443
Other shoe.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.340
Sockie.

27:10.575 --> 27:11.683
Other sockie.

27:11.684 --> 27:13.951
Don't rely on machines, Kryten.

27:14.188 --> 27:17.185
Or else we'll lose the very thing
that makes us human.

27:17.186 --> 27:18.386
Open.

27:19.776 --> 27:22.276
Ahh.
That's the lad.
