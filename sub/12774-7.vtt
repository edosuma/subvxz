don't understand

13:18.256 --> 13:19.591
how you did what you did.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.134
It was wrong.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.220
It was necessary.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.139
You don't understand.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.615
Yes, I do.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.576

13:47.661 --> 13:48.954
May I sit down?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.419

14:01.174 --> 14:02.300

14:02.509 --> 14:04.094

14:06.846 --> 14:08.765
All of them capable
of changing the world.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.476
The world should end if all
we do is slaughter each other.

We're here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

this madness...

14:41.756 --> 14:43.133

You can.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.607

naturally to you.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.612

Well, there's the law,
and then there's...

Uh-uh.
...what's right.

has anything to worry about.

no rush, right?

that we're here

and that we stand
between them and chaos.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.975
Wow, that's all great,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.144
but who's "we"?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.271

17:43.354 --> 17:45.523
Yeah, we're not ready

17:46.983 --> 17:49.027
No, Triphammer thought
we had potential.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.488
There's a difference.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.616
So we need to maximize
our potential.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.034
Okay, now you're talking.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.410
How do we do that?

17:57.660 --> 17:59.496
Not alone.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.206
We need
a commanding officer.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.624
(LAUGHS) Okay.

Let's dial the military
down a bit.

I didn't mean--
It's okay.

You hear
about the senator?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.071
Yeah.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.533
So about this coach?

18:36.658 --> 18:38.368
Think it's a good idea?

18:38.660 --> 18:41.204
Yeah, I know someone
that might help.

Then back splash here
and over there

18:52.757 --> 18:55.969

flung blood away.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.845
Has Marrs seen this?

18:57.929 --> 18:59.889
Uh, Dr. Marrs is out sick.

until she gets back.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.602
Is she okay?

19:04.727 --> 19:07.522
Well, cracking Powers
can take its toll.

19:07.939 --> 19:11.609
Anyway, I'd say that
the attack was fast.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.736
Takes approximately
500 pounds of force

19:13.861 --> 19:15.446
to crush a man's skull.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.074
So whoever did this
wasn't fooling around.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.410
Was he facing his killer?

19:20.535 --> 19:22.620
Well, it's hard to say,

19:22.745 --> 19:25.248
but based on the evidence,
I'd say yes.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.917
Two glasses and a bottle.
Yep.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.462
And the safe was open
when you got here?

19:31.588 --> 19:33.006
The staffer said it was,

19:33.089 --> 19:34.549
but you should check.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.301
Yeah.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.137
Can I, uh,
scrape him up now?
DEENA: Two seconds.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.389
The door was locked,
but the window was open?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.683
Again, staffer said yes,
but...

19:43.766 --> 19:46.269
You should check.
We'll check, yes.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.229
Uh, scrape away.
Okay.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.441
We're gonna need

for this guy.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.901

of Powers hate mail

19:57.280 --> 19:58.781

19:58.906 --> 20:01.159
His bill died as soon
as he fell from grace,

20:01.284 --> 20:02.452
so why murder him?

20:02.619 --> 20:03.953
Well, you kill one
anti-Powers leader,

20:04.078 --> 20:05.246
you threaten them all.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.290
He could've done it
any time. Why now?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.375

Okay.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.710
So crime of passion.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.212

or boyfriend.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.839

that it got out

20:14.964 --> 20:17.008
and didn't want
any more out there?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.688
Yeah.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.149
He's kind of an asshole.
I know.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.692
Yeah, but he was Diamond.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.069
So he knows things.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.237
What about your
friend SuperShock?

20:38.488 --> 20:39.989
Uh, I don't think so.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.824
He's not that sociable.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.701
And...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.912
Uh, nothing.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.538
He seems to like you.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.165
Yeah, but no, seriously,

20:49.290 --> 20:51.834
he's cranky,
and it's best
not to bother him.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.670
And Walker's not cranky?

20:53.795 --> 20:55.129
Well, at least we know
where to find him.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.839
And he knows us.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.508

and stomps his foot
or something,

not gonna fall off.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.684
That's something I think
I should do alone.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.727
If we all come at him--
Yeah.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.187
What if Walker says no?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.231

her debut with the senator.

on a reality series by now.

that means something.

Why?

24:26.883 --> 24:28.885
Because she says
her boyfriend
killed the senator,

in a bunker

the Russians get,

the sooner he's liable
to use his bombs.

Hey!

34:24.480 --> 34:25.647

34:29.735 --> 34:31.320
If he bit the senator's
head off,

34:31.445 --> 34:33.322
it was with
a spitless mouth.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.656
No saliva.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.909
No matching DNA at all.

Okay, enough.
Thank you.

34:40.704 --> 34:41.830
We get it.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.332
He alibi out?

34:43.457 --> 34:45.876
On the night in question,
he was at a bar in Bakersfield

34:46.001 --> 34:49.171
playing in a band
from 9:00 p.m.
till 4:00 in the morning.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.133
So, not your dog.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.843
No, only thing
he's guilty of

34:54.968 --> 34:58.555
is writing a stupid letter
to his ex-girlfriend.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.351
Speaking of letters,
we should get
to that hate mail.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.728
Uh, give me a minute.
I got a thing.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.480
Where you going?

35:06.563 --> 35:08.524
Her dad's trial,
I would think.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.234
That's today?

35:10.359 --> 35:11.652
(LAUGHS)
It's been all week.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.570
Shit. Ugh.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.948

35:38.470 --> 35:39.721
Yeah.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.890
Yeah, terrific.

not a good time.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.229
Yeah, well,
haven't you noticed?

35:57.072 --> 35:58.907
And who's...
who's Tiberio?

35:58.991 --> 36:00.492
That's Triphammer's
new recruit.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.619
Oh, yeah. Martinez.

Yes.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.792
You should go see a doctor.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.421
I did.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.340
He says
it's just a headache.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.801
I'm good.
What can I do for you?

36:18.927 --> 36:20.429
Well, we want to team up,

36:20.554 --> 36:21.680
but we need help.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.265
Help?

36:23.348 --> 36:24.558
Guidance.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.477
What kind of guidance?

36:27.603 --> 36:29.271
We want you to be
our Powers coach.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.275
Seriously?

36:33.567 --> 36:34.860
Come on, you've been there.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.069
Triphammer's gone,

36:36.153 --> 36:38.030
and who trained you?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.781
You didn't become
Diamond overnight.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.743
Somebody guided you,
like Janice or--

36:42.826 --> 36:44.119
It wasn't Janice.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.288
Who was it?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.248
Patrick.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.125
SuperShock.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.461
You're kidding me.
No.

36:52.628 --> 36:53.920
You should ask him.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.631
He'd probably get
a kick out of it.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.466
I'm asking you.

37:01.511 --> 37:05.057
Look, I appreciate it,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.143
and really,
it would be an honor.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.145
But...

37:10.270 --> 37:12.356
I'm not the right guy.

37:12.814 --> 37:13.982
You could be.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.493
I'm not, okay?
I'm sorry.

37:24.660 --> 37:25.994
I'm sorry.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.835

37:33.919 --> 37:35.837

You betcha.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.298
Ah.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.467
(LAUGHING)
What the fuck was that?

37:40.550 --> 37:42.719
That was the threat
of exposure.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.221
Certain people further up
the food chain

37:44.346 --> 37:45.847
weren't comfortable
with the idea

37:45.972 --> 37:49.434
of me being questioned,
and that ends that.

37:50.185 --> 37:53.355

the past is a bitch.

you're a great cop,

38:09.955 --> 38:12.708

you're shit.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.514
You make allowances.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.726
Allowances?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.602
Yeah.
What?

38:32.728 --> 38:35.063
Like, you let things slide

38:35.147 --> 38:36.565
even though you know
you shouldn't,

38:36.690 --> 38:38.275
and that somehow
makes things better?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.568
Yes.

so you do that.

deserved the best life
I could give you.

just not the way I'd hoped.

buy you a--

I was going to say.

of the atomic bomb
and its use

against the city of

I didn't know.

If Truman's hand was forced,
then he had to.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.026
He did it.
He was there, too.

As more information
comes to light,

40:49.155 --> 40:50.699

from the White House
and President Truman...

to use this...

He's a destroyer.

He's everywhere.

talking about?

who killed him.

I know who killed
the Knight.

It was him.

You might know him
better as The Ghost.

and...
