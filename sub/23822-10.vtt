<i>Holy crap!
Gary finds the anti-matter bomb,</i>

00:08.225 --> 00:09.799
<i>But to detonate it, they're
gonna have to get past</i>

00:09.800 --> 00:11.800
<i>the Lord Commander's
fleet of incinerators.</i>

00:11.835 --> 00:13.469
<i>Can they save the world?</i>

00:37.655 --> 00:40.220
Do these fools really think

00:40.255 --> 00:43.220
that I'll allow them
to close the breach?

00:43.230 --> 00:47.290
I was chosen by Titans.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.300
We might not make it out of this.

00:49.335 --> 00:52.630
I wanted to say...
I don't know what we are.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.727
A crew?
Feels like we're more than that.

00:55.762 --> 00:58.169
I mean, friends maybe?
But to me,

00:58.204 --> 01:02.240
we've become like a close,
but very strange family.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.022
And without you...

01:04.022 --> 01:07.049
- I wouldn't be me.
- Us! Us! Us! Us!

01:07.050 --> 01:09.484
- Uuuuus!
- Shut the hell up, KVN!

01:09.485 --> 01:11.780
I will never leave you, Gary.

01:11.815 --> 01:16.250
I will be your deep space insanity
avoidance forever companion.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.990
I swear to God, KVN!

01:18.025 --> 01:21.260
Anyways, whatever happens,
wherever we go,

01:21.295 --> 01:24.530
we find each other
when this is over.

01:24.565 --> 01:26.265

02:03.840 --> 02:05.334
There are too many, Gary.

02:05.335 --> 02:06.674
We'll never be able to break through.

02:06.675 --> 02:08.344
H.U.E., can't you find a way?

02:08.345 --> 02:10.770
<i>We can create
a Level 4 Particle Burn.</i>

02:10.780 --> 02:12.980
Great. While I bust out
my chemistry set,

02:13.015 --> 02:14.715
how about explaining
what the hell that means?!

02:14.745 --> 02:17.650
<i>It means we eject
our lightfold core...</i>

02:17.685 --> 02:19.154
<i>- and detonate it.
- What?!</i>

02:19.155 --> 02:22.120
Your great idea is to explode
our lightfold engine?!

02:22.155 --> 02:23.855
Ooo-whoa.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.094
H.U.E., eject the ...

02:29.860 --> 02:32.434
<i>- Done, Gary.
- Seriously?</i>

02:32.435 --> 02:34.730
I mean, next time,
can you warn me first?

02:34.765 --> 02:38.000
<i>Gary...
there is no "next time."</i>

02:40.210 --> 02:43.870
<i>Detonating in 3... 2...</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:45.314

<i>...Boomtown.</i>

03:02.465 --> 03:04.490
H.U.E.,
full speed toward the breach.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.900
We got a freakin' hole to close.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.074
Is this fun?

03:19.075 --> 03:20.780
It is! It is fun!

03:26.190 --> 03:29.684
Release the hives.

03:29.685 --> 03:31.920
Crush them!

03:37.565 --> 03:39.600
<i>Shields up, Gary.</i>

03:39.635 --> 03:40.964
H.U.E., what the crap is that?

03:40.965 --> 03:43.400
<i>The Lord Commander's
hive ships, Gary.</i>

03:43.435 --> 03:44.904
<i>If they eat through the shields,</i>

03:44.905 --> 03:46.740
<i>there will be
nothing left to stop them.</i>

03:46.775 --> 03:48.475
How long will the shields hold?

03:48.505 --> 03:51.670
<i>Shield Integrity
is at 79% and dropping.</i>

03:51.680 --> 03:54.210
That's like a ...
That's like a B-minus!

03:54.245 --> 03:55.945
We're still good!

03:56.680 --> 03:58.550
<i>Now at 63%.</i>

03:58.585 --> 04:01.550
Oh, crap!
That's, like, a D, at best!

04:01.585 --> 04:03.820
<i>KVN, if you don't get
on the outside turret,</i>

04:03.855 --> 04:06.090
<i>I will beat you within
one inch of your life.</i>

04:06.125 --> 04:09.430
Guys, I'm the most expendable!
Congratulations to me.

04:09.465 --> 04:12.960
- Mooncake, what are you doing?
- Chookity pok.

04:14.665 --> 04:18.098
All right.
But you're not expendable.

04:21.605 --> 04:23.840
<i>Gary, the hives
have breached the shield.</i>

04:23.875 --> 04:27.580
<i>KVN and Mooncake won't be able
to hold them off for long.</i>

04:31.485 --> 04:32.789
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no!</i>

04:32.790 --> 04:35.590
This isn't a fight.
It's a death sentence.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.024
Can a Hawk punch
through the hive?

04:37.025 --> 04:39.660
<i>Provided there is sufficient force, yes.</i>

04:39.695 --> 04:42.730
Then we will load the anti-matter
bomb onto a Hawk and use that.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.930
But as soon as the drones see
the Hawk, they'll destroy it.

04:44.965 --> 04:47.910
Not if we send somebody
out first to clear the way.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.739
- I'll do it.
- This is no job for a kid.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.670
I don't see a kid anymore.
I see a Man-Cat.

04:54.705 --> 04:58.644
- Quinn, I can do this.
- We will go with Little Cato.

04:58.645 --> 05:00.540
So that he doesn't
die like his father.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.685
Whoops, that was insensitive.
Sorry.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.280
Make us proud.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.654
H.U.E., get him a Hawk.

05:08.655 --> 05:12.820
- Be careful out there, Man-Cat.
- Don't worry. I got this.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.429
I so got this.

05:14.430 --> 05:16.430
<i> I got this so good.</i>

05:16.465 --> 05:18.900
<i>Oooh, I got it.
I'm gonna get this...</i>

05:27.570 --> 05:29.610
All right, it's ready to go.

05:34.450 --> 05:37.180
To think, that's the only
thing stopping the Earth

05:37.215 --> 05:40.154
from getting swallowed up.
And it's all on me.

05:40.155 --> 05:41.855
I thought it would've
looked much cooler.

05:41.885 --> 05:45.294
Should I draw some flames on it?
I brought various tubes of this.

05:45.295 --> 05:48.364
No! How about you don't draw
flames on the anti-matter bomb?!

05:48.365 --> 05:51.800
Is it too late?
It is.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.130
- What if I can't do it?
- Try your best.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.800
What if my best
isn't good enough?

05:59.835 --> 06:01.535
It's good enough for me.

06:01.810 --> 06:06.174
Have I made things better?
I did!

06:06.175 --> 06:07.875
It's go time.

06:08.950 --> 06:11.150
- What are you doing?
- Finishing the job.

06:11.185 --> 06:13.550
Except I'm the one
taking it to the breach.

06:13.585 --> 06:17.690
- It's my mission.
- Too bad. It's my destiny.

06:20.490 --> 06:22.064
Why are you fighting me?

06:22.065 --> 06:25.030
Because I can take anything,
except losing you!

06:25.065 --> 06:28.900
Oh, God, why, Quinn?!
Why are we in this situation?!

06:28.935 --> 06:31.830
From the moment I discovered
the gravitational disturbance,

06:31.840 --> 06:33.970
I knew this was my life's work.

06:34.005 --> 06:36.910
If you really have feelings for me...

06:36.945 --> 06:41.469
- let me see this through to the end.
- I am genuinely perplexed here!

06:43.015 --> 06:46.320
'Cause I'm ... I'm trying
to stop you from dying.

06:46.355 --> 06:48.055
Please.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.024
Then, Quinn Ergon,

06:51.025 --> 06:55.460
I will use every last breath
to make sure you succeed.

06:55.495 --> 06:58.567
That's a real, raw promise.

06:58.730 --> 07:00.600
- Hwa!
- Mmm.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.504
Hell... Hell, yeah!

07:03.505 --> 07:05.205
More of that
when you come back.

07:05.235 --> 07:06.209
Don't die on me.

07:06.210 --> 07:08.940
Funny, I thought
I was gonna be the hero...

07:08.975 --> 07:13.480
- but it's you.
- No, it's both of us.

07:13.515 --> 07:15.980
Always has been.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.240
Punch a hole for me, boys!

07:43.140 --> 07:46.240
Okay, guys, all together now.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.620
- Thanks, Little Cato.
- Finish it, Quinn.

07:58.725 --> 08:00.760
If only there was
more help to call on.

08:00.795 --> 08:02.560
If only there was a resistance.

08:02.595 --> 08:06.500
Wait, there is a resistance,
and I'm its leader.

08:06.535 --> 08:09.500
<i> Resistance?
Is it time to resist? It is!</i>

08:09.535 --> 08:12.040
<i>This is  General Tribore Menendez.</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:15.944
<i> All battalions to Sector 11.
Reeeeorr!</i>

08:15.945 --> 08:18.474
<i>Reeeeorr!
Reeeeorr!</i>

08:18.475 --> 08:20.014
<i> Reeeeorr!</i>

08:20.015 --> 08:21.414
<i> Reeeeorr!</i>

08:21.415 --> 08:24.929
<i>The hives have
infiltrated the Galaxy One.</i>

08:25.520 --> 08:28.684
Hey!
Get off my ship!

08:28.685 --> 08:31.190
Aaahhhh!

08:46.070 --> 08:49.010
Is this what death feels like?

08:49.045 --> 08:51.480
Not bad.
It's just weird.

08:51.515 --> 08:53.215
Closing in.

08:54.150 --> 08:59.620
- Ah! Am I alone here?
- No. Tribore's here.

08:59.655 --> 09:03.490
And I brought some special friends.

09:03.525 --> 09:05.225
Ahh!

09:06.690 --> 09:10.230
Thanks, Tribore.
I'm closing in on the breach.

09:14.170 --> 09:17.866
Is this bad?
It sure the hell is!

09:17.900 --> 09:21.100
No, Tribore.
I loved you.

09:21.110 --> 09:22.744
Who's leading the resistance now?

09:22.745 --> 09:27.440
I am. First order of business ...
revenge.

09:29.685 --> 09:31.385
Eject!

09:41.425 --> 09:44.530
Yes.
Two at once! Nice shot.

09:44.565 --> 09:47.800
Down you go!
Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha.

09:48.965 --> 09:50.665
Wow!
I'm impressed with myself.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.440
Ooh.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.740
- Hey, Gary?
- What is it, KVN?!

09:59.515 --> 10:02.010
- It's been fun, right?
- Oh! KVN!

10:02.045 --> 10:05.485
I guess? Hey!
I had... fun...

10:07.420 --> 10:09.450
It's so beautiful.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.630
Call back the hives and
ready the dimension splitter.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.940
Chookity!

10:26.300 --> 10:28.709
Ooh...

10:29.780 --> 10:32.074
Mooncake!
No!

10:32.075 --> 10:36.450
Ah!
Uh!

10:39.790 --> 10:41.490
Ohhh...

10:43.660 --> 10:45.094
Chookity pok!

10:46.495 --> 10:51.930
The more you resist,
the stronger the trap becomes.

10:51.965 --> 10:54.460
Hey, Mooncake...

10:54.470 --> 10:59.470
We're going to have a lot of fun.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.687
<i>Approaching breach.</i>

11:01.688 --> 11:05.580
Here goes everything.

11:12.455 --> 11:14.155
Ugh!

11:16.760 --> 11:20.090
Aaah!

11:35.205 --> 11:36.544
Ugh...

11:36.545 --> 11:38.310
Agh!

11:39.710 --> 11:42.284
Ughh!

11:42.285 --> 11:45.250
Status report.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.990
<i>Gary, we have lost the Galaxy One.</i>

11:50.025 --> 11:51.494
We still have a left pulse engine.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.195
<i>It is the right pulse engine,</i>

11:53.225 --> 11:56.530
<i>and it is not enough
to face the Lord Commander.</i>

11:56.565 --> 12:00.000
<i>Gary, there's one option
you haven't considered.</i>

12:00.035 --> 12:02.000
<i>You can abandon ship.</i>

12:02.035 --> 12:04.270
I'm not running away.
Not this time.

12:04.305 --> 12:08.075
At one point, that made sense, but...
I'm not that guy anymore.

12:08.105 --> 12:09.679
<i>I'd give you a cookie.</i>

12:09.680 --> 12:11.680
<i>But I think you've
outgrown that now.</i>

12:11.715 --> 12:14.444
What?!
No! Give me a cookie!

12:14.445 --> 12:16.280
I will never, ever outgrow a cookie!

12:16.315 --> 12:20.220
<i>I'm sorry, Gary, but
they're gone. All gone.</i>

12:20.255 --> 12:21.724
That sucks, H.U.E.!

12:21.725 --> 12:23.950
<i>It... really does, Gary.</i>

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
We can't let this guy win.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.960
<i>Gary, I know that look.
Reconsider. Please.</i>

12:29.995 --> 12:33.830
No way, José.
I won't reconsider.

12:35.465 --> 12:38.640
<i>Gary, you have set a collision
course directly for</i>

12:38.675 --> 12:40.970
<i>the Lord Commander's
Heavy Incinerator.</i>

12:42.545 --> 12:44.710
It's the only the way to stop
him from taking out Quinn.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.274
And I have to save Mooncake.

12:46.275 --> 12:49.250
Do I really have to make
a list for you right now?!

12:49.285 --> 12:51.920
If we're going out,
we're going out big.

12:51.955 --> 12:54.589
<i>Agreed.
We must do everything possible</i>

12:54.590 --> 12:56.390
<i>to destroy that dick loaf.</i>

12:56.425 --> 12:59.320
What do you say
we make an entrance?

12:59.330 --> 13:01.860
<i>Right pulse engine is a go.</i>

13:05.260 --> 13:08.930
What? 
What is he trying to accomplish?!

13:08.965 --> 13:10.800
He's already lost everything.

13:12.835 --> 13:16.610
<i>Proximity alert!
Proximity alert!</i>

13:16.645 --> 13:20.540
Fire!
Rip that ship from space!

13:48.805 --> 13:52.710
I wish killing you
could last a lifetime.

13:54.815 --> 13:58.650
- Ready for your turn?
- Get on with it!

13:58.685 --> 14:02.790
Aaaah!

14:18.305 --> 14:23.740
<i>Gary, the Galaxy One...</i>

14:23.775 --> 14:26.410
<i> is destroyed...</i>

14:26.445 --> 14:29.010
H.U.E., quick!
Transfer your AI into my helmet.

14:29.045 --> 14:32.120
No, no, no. H.U.E.!
H.U.E.?!

14:32.620 --> 14:34.350
H.U.E.!

14:34.385 --> 14:35.724
<i>Yes, Gary. I'm here.</i>

14:35.725 --> 14:38.220
Oh, my gosh.
Don't ever leave me, H.U.E.

14:38.255 --> 14:40.160
<i>- Wouldn't think of it, Gary.
- Chookity!</i>

14:52.935 --> 14:56.510
<i>Final Space Dimension Splitter
 has been armed.</i>

14:56.545 --> 14:59.640
<i>15 seconds until activation.</i>

15:03.085 --> 15:06.250
- Mooncake!
- Here he is...

15:06.285 --> 15:11.055
the infamous hero!
The Gary!

15:11.060 --> 15:13.120
Just... Gary!

15:13.130 --> 15:16.234
Yes ... just The Gary.

15:16.269 --> 15:18.590
Let him go!
He's done nothing to you!

15:18.600 --> 15:22.070
You're just in time
to see Mooncake...

15:22.105 --> 15:26.870
...open the doorway of Final Space.

15:27.905 --> 15:30.810
Hang tight, little buddy!

15:40.455 --> 15:42.350
<i> Chookity...</i>

15:46.830 --> 15:49.090
Ugh!

15:49.125 --> 15:53.230
 Can't you see?
There is no one beside you.

15:53.265 --> 15:56.630
Avocato, his son, your crew?

15:56.640 --> 16:00.440
Everyone you've
cared about is gone!

16:00.475 --> 16:02.440
All because of that!

16:02.475 --> 16:07.640
And now, your life ends.
But nothing quick.

16:07.650 --> 16:12.520
I want you to experience the
same pain you put me through.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.850
A slow, painful death.

16:15.885 --> 16:18.590
You don't get it, do you?

16:18.625 --> 16:23.294
The good guys win in the end!
They always do.

16:23.295 --> 16:27.060
No.
Not this time, The Gary.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.670
- Don't do this, Jack.
- Why would you call me that?

16:30.705 --> 16:33.504
- Speak!
- You used to like taquitos

16:33.505 --> 16:35.540
and hanging out with my dad, man.

16:35.575 --> 16:40.480
Ahh.
John Goodspeed's son.

16:40.515 --> 16:43.280
Well... that changes nothing!

16:43.315 --> 16:47.420
- You don't need to do this, Jack.
- Stop calling me that!

16:47.455 --> 16:51.490
That person died
the day I was chosen.

16:51.525 --> 16:55.490
Can I be honest, with the likelihood
of pissing you off a little bit?

16:55.525 --> 16:57.099
I don't think you were chosen.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.760
You getting these powers...
was just a mistake.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.204
Mistake?!

17:02.205 --> 17:06.440
- Rraaaaahh!
- Aaahh!

17:11.615 --> 17:16.450
Now, let's take a look
at what's inside Final Space.

17:35.035 --> 17:36.930
Aaah!

17:36.940 --> 17:41.374
The time has come! Yes!

17:44.140 --> 17:45.940
Take me!

17:47.350 --> 17:54.450
I'm ready to be a Titan
and rule every dimension!

17:55.420 --> 18:00.220
No! No!
Nooo!

18:11.735 --> 18:13.700
<i>Gary?</i>

18:13.710 --> 18:16.510
<i>- Quinn...
- I'm sorry.</i>

18:16.545 --> 18:19.849
- For... what?
- Not telling you sooner.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.850
<i>You can tell me
when you come back.</i>

18:21.885 --> 18:25.120
- Gary...
- No, don't...

18:25.155 --> 18:29.781
- Don't say it.
- I'm not coming back.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.420
Quinn.

18:33.790 --> 18:36.530
We've lost the Earth,
but I can still save you.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.930
Goodbye, Gary.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.438
I'll miss you.

18:51.210 --> 18:52.910
Quinn?!

18:56.820 --> 19:00.820
You have got to be kidding.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.620
H.U.E., get her back.
Co-Come on.

19:06.630 --> 19:10.130
Quinn!
H.U.E., get her back!

19:12.160 --> 19:13.860
Quinn!

19:16.469 --> 19:19.536
_

19:30.815 --> 19:33.720
H.U.E., what are my chances
of getting out of this mess?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.084
<i>In your current state,</i>

19:35.085 --> 19:39.390
<i>you will pass the point of
recovery in 10 minutes...</i>

19:39.425 --> 19:42.164
<i>9 minutes...
8...</i>

19:42.165 --> 19:44.564
<i>- 7...
- Look, it's Carl.</i>

19:44.565 --> 19:46.530
<i>- 6...
- It can't be...</i>

19:46.565 --> 19:49.164
<i>5... 4...</i>

19:49.165 --> 19:50.434
<i>3...</i>

19:50.435 --> 19:55.410
<i>2... The cookies will
be done in one minute.</i>

19:55.445 --> 19:59.610
Oh, good.
I'm extremely excited...

19:59.645 --> 20:02.750
- for these cookies.
- Zero.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.480
<i>Gary, the cookies are done.</i>

20:13.995 --> 20:16.230
<i>I'll miss you, friend.</i>

20:30.345 --> 20:33.344
- Hey, son.
- Holy crap.

20:33.345 --> 20:34.544
Am I dreaming?

20:34.545 --> 20:38.180
- No.
- Oh. Well. Then... I'm...

20:38.215 --> 20:40.884
- Yep.
- Well, crap, that's not good.

20:40.885 --> 20:42.920
You see, I was ...
I was hoping for a no.

20:42.955 --> 20:45.190
I was sent to give you a choice ...

20:45.225 --> 20:47.390
to come with me or to go back.

20:47.425 --> 20:49.460
What's... that way?

20:49.495 --> 20:52.130
Lots, and I mean lots, of imported beer.

20:52.165 --> 20:55.730
- It's actually ridiculous.
- How much beer are we talking?

20:55.765 --> 20:57.530
Too much.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.234
And back that way?

20:59.235 --> 21:02.010
A perilous journey full
of death and heartbreak.

21:03.270 --> 21:06.034
Which way is Little Cato?

21:06.645 --> 21:09.218
Which way is Mooncake?

21:09.715 --> 21:14.316
Which way is Quinn?
