Where the hell is Henry?

PAN: A map that will lead you
straight to your son.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.588
Careful. He may look like a boy,
but he's a bloody demon.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.340
The heart of the truest believer.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.717
You are the lucky owner
of that very special heart.

00:15.808 --> 00:16.797
Robin Hood?

00:16.893 --> 00:18.224
What are you doing trespassing
in my castle?

00:18.311 --> 00:19.300

00:19.395 --> 00:21.260
Oh, no. Emma's in Neverland.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.270
Just who are you, Swan?

00:27.403 --> 00:28.358
Wouldn't you like to know?

00:28.446 --> 00:29.435
Perhaps I would.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.329
DAVID: Hey. You need a break?

00:40.499 --> 00:41.659
MARY: No, I'm good.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.919
In this heat
you shouldn't overtax yourself.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.251
So, you need a break.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.920
No, I'm good.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.919
Did David Nolan let himself go?

00:52.011 --> 00:53.467
-Does it look like he let himself go?
-(CHUCKLES)

00:54.180 --> 00:55.670
How much further?

00:56.140 --> 00:58.256
We should be getting
close to Pan's lair.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.970
Going in a straight-line course...

Son of a... How is it now behind us?

01:09.153 --> 01:11.235
-How can that be?
-You got us lost.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.812
No, she didn't.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.325
It's the camp. Pan's moving it.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.991
He's playing tricks on us.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.987
lf Pan's camp keeps moving,
how are we gonna find Henry?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.339
PAN: Cuckoo!

01:30.341 --> 01:32.332
Wake up! Catch.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.552
I don't like apples.

01:37.682 --> 01:38.842
Who doesn't like apples?

01:39.350 --> 01:40.465
It's a family thing.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.972
(CHUCKLES) Well, don't worry.
They're not for eating.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.139
It's for a kind of game.
A really fun game.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.022
I call it target practice.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.719
You found the crystal ball.
What else are you looking for?

02:18.848 --> 02:20.429
That showed me where Emma is,
now I have to get to her.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.890
I'm not sure you're gonna find
a horse in there, mate.

02:23.019 --> 02:25.852
I don't need a horse. I need a portal.
A way to create a portal.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.975
Why don't you calm down
and tell me what the problem is.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.931
Perhaps I can assist?

02:31.068 --> 02:33.525
Henry is trapped in Neverland
with Peter Pan,

02:33.612 --> 02:36.103
who is, hands down,
the nastiest person I've ever met.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.276
I saw Emma in that ball, not Henry.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.899
Listen. lwas in Neverland.

02:40.036 --> 02:42.368
Pan was looking for a boy,
a specific boy.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.241
I know he had some picture of
him on a scroll.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.829
He called him "the truest believer."

02:45.916 --> 02:47.042
And you believe that to be Henry?

02:47.126 --> 02:50.914
It has to be. That's the only reason
Emma would be in Neverland.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.421
Help me look.
Lots of things make portals.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.963
Beans, magic mirrors, ruby slippers,
some kinds of ashes...

03:14.987 --> 03:16.147
Who's this?

03:16.280 --> 03:20.489
Merry Men come in all sizes.
This is my son, Roland.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.447
I know how to get to Neverland.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.622
I know how to get to Henry.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.408
So, this whole trek's been for nothing.

03:31.504 --> 03:33.290
I told you walking was idiotic.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.590
If we can just use some magic, we can
materialize in the camp and grab Henry.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.167
We don't know where the camp is.
Have you even been listening?

03:40.304 --> 03:41.669
Pan'll have shields against magic.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.797
I fear such an attempt
would end in your death.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.140
And more importantly, mine.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.054
Which is why we're walking.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.933
Well, then what's your idea?
How are we going to find it?

03:52.024 --> 03:54.106
-By using someone he trusts.
-Who?

03:54.777 --> 03:56.984
Because I'd guess
he certainly doesn't trust you.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.321
A fairy who lived here when l was about.
She might still be on the island.

04:00.449 --> 04:04.658
She'd be an inside source, knows all
about the camp and can get us in.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.158
She might even have some pixie dust
left. Perhaps we could fly in.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.455
You mean fairy dust.

04:09.542 --> 04:13.911
No, pixie dust. It's stronger.
Like nuclear fairy dust.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.578
Wait. A fairy...

04:18.008 --> 04:18.997

04:20.970 --> 04:23.006
Every kid in the world knows her.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.337
It's a bad idea.

Mark my words. This Tinker Bell
is not going to save us.

for your lessons today,

04:43.409 --> 04:45.365
I assumed you'd went toes-up.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.170
I'm not sure about these
lessons anymore.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.665

a future that looks like...

05:01.760 --> 05:03.045
Like what?

05:03.137 --> 05:05.048
Like you.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.259

are we, Your Majesty?

05:08.350 --> 05:10.261
Why shouldn't I?

05:10.352 --> 05:14.311
I'm the Queen,
but I'm practically a prisoner.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.515
With a husband whose heart is
still with his dead wife

05:17.610 --> 05:19.225
and his insipid daughter.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.235

05:29.079 --> 05:30.239
I need options.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.743
Can't be done. You see, this is how it is.

05:33.834 --> 05:38.043
You think you're the diner at the feast.
Tasting the offerings.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.872
A little love, a little darkness.

05:40.966 --> 05:45.460

you are the feast.

And the darkness has tasted you.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.599
You're vile. Leave my home.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.393
The darkness likes how you taste,

05:55.481 --> 05:57.642
It doesn't mind the bitter.

it's going to finish it.

That's so sad. Regina, love.

it always comes with a price.

Well, sometimes not using it
comes with a price, too.

You won't see summer.

-No!
-You have to.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.472
Maybe I don't.

How's that?

And maybe, just maybe,
I'll leave a way open for you.

39:10.933 --> 39:14.596
But you've only got one shot,
so you better have a good plan.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.931
Thank you. We will.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.929
Come with us to our camp.
We'll figure it out.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.073
-Hey.
-(lNHALES DEEPLY)

39:30.160 --> 39:31.366
Are you all right? You look upset.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.614
Yeah. (SIGHS)
| just want to get Henry back.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.956
We're on the way.

39:35.082 --> 39:37.619
How'd you know that would work?
Offering her a home?

39:38.252 --> 39:39.367
(INHALES DEEPLY)

39:39.586 --> 39:41.872
It worked for me.

39:41.964 --> 39:45.707
When I was a bandit living alone,
all I wanted was a home.

39:47.219 --> 39:50.382
Thing is, I never found it
until you came along.

39:50.472 --> 39:54.761
Even now, when I'm with you,
that's all I need.

39:57.646 --> 39:58.726
You sure you're okay?

39:58.814 --> 39:59.803
(SIGHS)

40:01.149 --> 40:02.810
-I love you.
-Hmm.

40:03.485 --> 40:07.273
Come on. Last thing we need
is to get lost in here.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.470
(GROANS)

40:46.778 --> 40:50.020
Welcome home, Baelfire.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.446
Pan will be so happy to see you.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.034
Thanks.

41:17.851 --> 41:21.890
Did you ever go back and find him?
The man with the lion tattoo?

41:24.566 --> 41:25.555
No.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.016
Unreal.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.727
Do you know how selfish that is?

41:32.658 --> 41:34.239
It's a lot of things.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.033
But how is it selfish?

41:39.039 --> 41:41.155
Because you didn'tjust ruin your life.

41:42.751 --> 41:44.241
You ruined his.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.888
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

42:12.781 --> 42:13.861
Welcome.
