00:11.845 --> 00:13.555
Tyricia's lucky she got to work with you.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.681
-I'm jealous.
-Well, thanks.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.184
-Hopefully, I'll get a chance too.
-She gets a win, so that's pretty lucky.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.729
She's really lucky.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.397
-Crazy, right?
-My God, how do you feel?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.483
-I feel really good. I'm happy.
-I'm so happy you won. So, so happy.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.819
I did the crater. I did the anchor.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.071
-It's good. Yeah.
-I did the landing zone.

00:30.155 --> 00:34.659
I really wish we could have done
this challenge as an individual challenge,

00:34.743 --> 00:39.372
because that showpiece would have looked
the same if I had done it by myself,

00:39.456 --> 00:41.458
and I don't think Tyricia could say that.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.043
The whole time, she was like,

00:43.126 --> 00:46.504
"We'll be the first all-female team
that won," so she had her, like…

00:46.588 --> 00:47.422
Mm-hmm.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.759
And then… But I'm like,
"She doesn't think I'm gonna win."

00:50.842 --> 00:53.344
I definitely think
she was mad that she didn't win.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.055
-

00:55.138 --> 00:57.682
I don't think
she considered me competition,

00:58.266 --> 00:59.976
and I won.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.896
I kinda just didn't want her to win,

01:02.979 --> 01:05.356
'cause I just feel like she got rid of you
because she's…

01:05.857 --> 01:07.609
-Yeah, that was shady.
-She's threatened.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.569
From a score-wise perspective,

01:10.195 --> 01:13.156
you have the most wiggle room to sit out.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.033
I do think that's unfair.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.826
-You think it's unfair?
-Yes.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.122
-It was kinda harsh, you know?
-Oh, it was so harsh. The whole thing.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.209
I cannot believe
she just won on my piece.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.253
You deserve it, and that's what matters.
You're showing it, Chef's seeing it,

01:27.337 --> 01:29.756
everybody's seeing it,
so that's… that's really what matters.

01:29.839 --> 01:33.051
It's so frustrating.
I'm so irritated.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.603
-Good morning.
-Another day.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.438
-Morning, Mellisa!
-Morning.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.148
You better watch out
for me and Juan today.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.901
Mm-hmm. We're coming for you, guys.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.278
-Uh-oh. What is that stuff?
-Uh-oh.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.323
-Morning, Chef.
-Good morning.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.908
Good morning, everyone.

01:56.991 --> 01:57.951
Oh my…

01:58.535 --> 01:59.702
So cute!

02:00.578 --> 02:03.581
I'm afraid he's gonna pick it up,
shake it, and it's gonna work.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.875
-Oh my. Hopefully not.
-That's awesome.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.128
-Have a little hint?
-Sugar?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.463
-It's sugar.
-It will be about sugar.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.259
This might be the hardest thing
you can do with sugar.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.343
Oh yeah.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.888
To make it look like a perfect bubble,
but it's sugar.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.683
I'm very excited
we're learning this technique, though.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.435
Seeing it a couple times,
I'm like, "How the frig is he doing it?"

02:26.229 --> 02:28.523
It's very difficult
to obtain the perfect result.

02:28.606 --> 02:32.694
But you will see if you follow
exactly what I'm saying, you can do it.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.946
I have very big expectations.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.491
This is the last pastry exercise
of this course.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.576
Oh God.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.536
A lot of pressure. We're near the end.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.290
The 50 grand,
and to teach an international class,

02:45.373 --> 02:46.833
a lot is on the line.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.672
How many of you have sugar experience?

02:52.755 --> 02:55.466
-On a scale of one to ten, negative ten.
-Negative ten.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.719
-So, not a lot.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.596
I will demonstrate a dome,

02:59.679 --> 03:03.057
and I will also demonstrate
inflated sugar with a sugar pump.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.226
So you will have various options.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.312
We're going to start with a dome.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.023
I'm starting with water and glucose.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.610
While this is going on a very slow speed,

03:13.693 --> 03:16.154
we're going to set the plastic wrap.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.697
The difficulty starts now.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.367
We're gonna apply a thin layer on top.

03:21.451 --> 03:26.873
I'm going to seal the side
so that the air inside is trapped.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.168
That's the key, huh?
Without this, it doesn't work.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.006
We're going to put a little bit of sugar.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.467
I'm just using regular cake rings.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.011
We're going to flip the ring over.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.013
And we're pushing.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.099
Why does it inflate?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.435
I trapped air inside the bucket.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.855
The air wants to go out
because I'm applying pressure.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.108
The only choice for the air to exit,
it's from the middle.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.987
And as you apply pressure evenly,
the sugar is going to push.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.950
We'll use a fan to cool down
what we're doing faster.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.202
Oh!

04:04.285 --> 04:05.703
Wow.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.209
-Oh my God!
-Wow.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.126
That's crazy.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.128
Now we know the secret.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.965
-Ooh!

04:17.840 --> 04:20.093
-Look how thin it is.
-Like glass.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.678
-Wow.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.889
When you work with sugar,
you really want the thing to be thin.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.105
That dome is something completely new
that Chef Amaury created.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.940
Like, that was insane.

04:34.732 --> 04:38.069
Next, I'm going to show you
how to blow sugar, how to inflate.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.699
To blow a sugar bubble,
we use one of these bad boys.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.617
Okay? Copper pipe.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.577
I'm warming it.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.205
You take the appropriate amount of sugar,

04:49.289 --> 04:52.709
use your thumbs,
and create some kind of cavity inside.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.380
Start sealing that cavity to pretty much
starting the base of your sphere.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.299
Once you get this,

04:59.382 --> 05:01.050
you're gonna just blow once.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.678
We already have something coming, right?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.390
And as it's cooling down, you pump it.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.601
Turn it, so it… it will cool down evenly.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.188
And once it's cold enough,

05:14.272 --> 05:16.607
I'm gonna warm the metal pipe,

05:16.691 --> 05:18.651
and I can remove this guy.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.196
Once you get this, what do you do with it?
You warm your cutter…

05:24.407 --> 05:25.408
you take your sphere…

05:28.578 --> 05:30.163
and you poke your hole through it.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.581
Yes, Chef.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.583
They didn't teach me that in school.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.211
The difficulty not only is to get
a perfect sphere, of course,

05:37.295 --> 05:38.629
but most of all,

05:38.713 --> 05:40.506
it's to get a very thin shell.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.135
-Wow.
-Well, good luck, everybody.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.388
So, now I want <i>you</i> to wow me.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.724
You're going to have
four and a half hours.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.768
You create whatever you want,

05:51.851 --> 05:54.729
but it must include a blown sugar,

05:54.812 --> 05:56.731
no matter how you blow the sugar.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.149
Time to shine.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.778
Give it your best. You may begin.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.830
This is
the final pastry exercise,

06:12.914 --> 06:16.125
and it's important because I wanna put
something out that I'm proud of.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.836
Minimalistic,
but yet beautiful and delicious.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.880
-Thiago, my friend.
-Yes, Chef.

06:20.963 --> 06:25.093
-What are we doing today?
-I am making a rose for my wife.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.719
So entremet size?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.263
Yeah. Entremet size.
Not as big as the crayon.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.640
A little bit smaller.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.433
And what… what are the flavor profiles?

06:32.517 --> 06:35.269
I wanna do a chocolate raspberry,
a little chocolate mousse.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.231
I wanna do a little black cocoa cookie
to go on the bottom of it.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.234
-Allow yourself a bit of time to practice.
-Yes, Chef.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.860
I'm trying to get everything done.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.154
-So I can just focus on that.
-Okay. Good.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.740
I just wanted to make a cake for…
for my wife.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.788
If anybody's been there for me
through good and bad times, it's her.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.498
It's really her, and, um…

06:55.581 --> 06:56.958
I know that no matter what,

06:57.041 --> 06:59.836
she's gonna, you know,
stick by my side and…

07:02.130 --> 07:04.298
I just wanted to do
something really nice for her.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.676
So, this one's for her.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.137
I'm such a crybaby.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.610
-Already going at it?
-Yes, Chef.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.114
-What do you plan on doing?
-Planning on making a magnifying glass.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.991
The pastry itself
is gonna be in the handle,

07:30.074 --> 07:32.785
which I'm gonna use the technique
from day one, making a shell,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.579
and then filling it
with the pastry itself.

07:34.662 --> 07:39.083
Oh, I like that. I like that you're giving
a specific purpose to the sugar technique.

07:39.667 --> 07:44.338
Because the challenge was a sugar dome,
I wanted to do that first when I was calm.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.507
I've learned from the hinge exercise

07:46.591 --> 07:49.552
that I can get very stressed
as we go throughout the exercise.

07:49.635 --> 07:53.556
So, I want a better experience
than me running around and cursing a lot.

07:55.099 --> 07:55.933
Stop.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.519
Very good.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.607
Push.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.446
Yes. Yes. Keep pushing.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.282
-Good job, Daniel.
-Thank you, Chef.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.035
I was blown away. I was in awe.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.787
Of all the techniques for pastry,
that's the one I was like, "Yes!"

08:17.371 --> 08:20.166
Hopefully this gives you a little hope,
that it works.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.467
Last pastry challenge.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.886
-Exactly. I wanna make sure…
-Going all out, right?

08:31.969 --> 08:34.555
I'm going all out.
I'm gonna do a coffee entremet<i>.</i>

08:34.639 --> 08:36.557
We're gonna have a chocolate sponge.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.602
We're gonna have
a coffee reconstructed streusel

08:39.685 --> 08:40.978
with a coffee mousse.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.105
I see a dome,
but I also see a sphere.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.358
Do you plan on doing
actually both sugar work?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.902
-Correct, Chef.
-Well, this is extremely ambitious.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.780
Yes, it might be ambitious.
I'm not gonna let you down.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.532
Now it's real. We're almost done.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.825
The prize is there,
and it's everybody's game.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.787
This was our last way
of showing what we can do on pastry,

08:57.870 --> 09:00.540
so I really wanna make sure
that I can do everything.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.375
I wanna be the winner.
I wanna win.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.464
My testing one.

09:08.548 --> 09:14.428
My whole thought process with deciding
to do blown sugar versus the sugar globe

09:14.512 --> 09:16.847
was because I thought
it was more fun to blow sugar.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.308
Okay.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.853
I want to create
a very small blown sugar apple

09:22.937 --> 09:25.565
on top of a plated apple pie dessert.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.859
Okay, keep blowing,
but upside down, Stephanie. Yeah.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.613
Blow. Gentle. Yeah. Keep blowing.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.158
Keep blowing a bit.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.496
-Sugar is…
-Sorry, Chef.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.414
No, it's okay.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.959
-But I think you are so close, Stephanie.
-It's why I gave myself time.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.378
-Very good.
-This is good practice for you.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.797
You need help?
No, you're good. You get this, right?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.382
Yeah. I got this. Thank you, Chef.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.554
Don't go like that! Ah!

09:58.681 --> 10:00.016
Color of blood.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.103
I wanted to do the blown sugar
and wanted to create a pear.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.938
I love to macerate fruits in wine.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.566
That is a technique
I was extremely confident in.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.859
What I really need to nail

10:09.942 --> 10:12.612
is the actual exercise,
which was the sugar.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.405
It's too hard.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.866
It's not soft enough.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.909
-Why?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.044
I'm not squeezing hard enough?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.379
I would put this back
in the microwave again.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.965
-It has to be the right consistency.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.344
-Don't get frustrated, Cedrick, okay?
-Too late.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.678
No. Just don't.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.681
Just remember, like,
the sugar can feel your emotions.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.111
It's okay. It's okay.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.033
-Mellisa.
-Hey, Chef.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.201
What are we doing today?

11:00.284 --> 11:03.704
I tried to think
about why I'd enclose something in sugar,

11:03.788 --> 11:09.001
and I think that, like,
precious things would be under cover.

11:09.085 --> 11:13.756
So I decided to do German chocolate cake,
and encase a little golden nugget.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.718
So, it'll be like if you first panned
for gold, you would keep your first one.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.969
Of course.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.014
Part of me was not surprised
that Tyricia was named best in class,

11:22.098 --> 11:26.519
because I've had three challenges
now so far where I'm kind of like,

11:26.602 --> 11:30.523
"Oh, the afterthought."

11:30.606 --> 11:33.150
So it's just perplexing to me.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.362
Chefs, you have three hours left.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.656
-Heard. Yes, Chef.
-Thank you. Three hours.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.782
Come on!

11:45.496 --> 11:46.539
One down.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.958
-Pull on that form.
-Yes.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.168
-St-- Uh, stop.
-I stopped.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.087
Slow pump. No, no, no! <i>Attention</i>.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.922
Little bit of slow pump again.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.842
And you want to maintain that shape. Okay?

11:57.925 --> 12:01.679
On to this, while it's cooling down.
Keep on blowing once in a while.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.097
-Heard.
-Like what you see?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.473
-I do, Chef.
-Good.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.976
The difficulty for me
throughout this entire course

12:07.059 --> 12:09.478
is exactly what Chef said.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.648
It's taking everything that you know,
but just flip it upside down.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.483
And I think, uh,
I was able to achieve that,

12:14.567 --> 12:17.194
definitely within these,
uh, these last two challenges.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.911
Immediately, I just fell in love
with the process of blowing apples

12:25.995 --> 12:27.705
and didn't wanna stop,
and I thought, like,

12:27.788 --> 12:30.791
"I'm doing great here.
I want a whole apple orchard."

12:30.875 --> 12:34.128
Like, "He's gonna have big ones,
little ones, be able to have his pick."

12:46.432 --> 12:49.310
Unfortunately, just the…

12:49.393 --> 12:52.396
…the process of creating
a hole in the bottom in the apple

12:52.480 --> 12:54.690
caused me to lose two or three,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.984
uh, or four apples.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.072
Okay! Can I do two now?

13:05.659 --> 13:07.036
No. One at a time.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.746
-Okay.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.707
Chefs, you have two hours remaining.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.459
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.543
Yes, Chef.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.671
Right behind.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.592
-Tell me when you're ready, okay?
-Okay.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.723
-I… I don't know what's going on.
-Sugar's at the right temperature?

13:27.807 --> 13:31.560
Sugar is at the right temperature,
but my… my plastic wrap is deflating.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.103
It's not poked through.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.647
Sugar is very temperamental.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.398
He makes it look easy.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.984
Okay. There we go.

13:39.068 --> 13:39.902
Come on, baby.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.406
Yeah, I would just kinda, like,
see if you can sorta shimmy it out maybe.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.662
-Oh.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.252
Yeah. Keep on pushing.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.712
Gentle. Gentle. In the middle. Gentle.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.172
Stop.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.967
Perfect. Push. Gentle push.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.428
-Stop! Oh no! Gentle!

14:07.096 --> 14:09.557
"Push! Push! Push!
Don't push too much!" I'm like,

14:09.640 --> 14:12.142
"Chef, do you want me
to apply pressure or to be gentle?"

14:12.226 --> 14:14.728
So now, confidence.
Get-- No, no. Go, go, go.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.522
Keep going. Keep going.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.942
Oh! I thought it was deflating.
I couldn't see, Chef.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.736
Oh! I'm gonna die today, I swear.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.447
You got one perfect one.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.909
-Aren't you happy? Hey!
-Yes, Chef. I'm so happy if I don't die.

14:34.832 --> 14:39.003
Yeah. I was like, "Oh, this is not…
This is… I'm gonna be in the bottom."

14:39.587 --> 14:42.089
Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.551
-Oh my God.
-Hey! Whoo! Whoo!

14:45.634 --> 14:47.469
-You good? Is it nice?
-Perfect.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.181
No, I didn't pull enough. Amanda?

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
Coming.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.435
Never mind. It's gone.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.395
-It popped?
-It popped again.

14:57.605 --> 15:02.276
I was able to do the spheres really fast,
but the domes, they keep breaking.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.986
It didn't matter, like, I was losing time.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.447
I was just like,
"You can do this. You can do this."

15:06.530 --> 15:07.364
Go.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.367
Nice. Yes.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.579
Yas, yas, yas, queen! Yas, queen!

15:14.622 --> 15:17.666
I see a smile on your face, Juan.
Are you happy?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.335
-Yes.
-Good.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.926
-Oh.
-That's a start, yeah?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.302
-Yep. Yep.
-All right.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.723
Chefs, you have one hour remaining.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.475
Yes, Chef.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.109
-What goes inside the apple?
-The… This.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.069
Just a full mousse?

15:45.152 --> 15:48.113
Well, now I'm reconsidering.
I was imagining my apples very small.

15:48.197 --> 15:52.785
Oh, okay, yeah. But you have, like,
decent-sized apple. This must be inside.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.412
Okay, I'm scared to put it inside,
but I'll do it.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.457
Chef decided I should have my apple filled

15:58.540 --> 16:01.043
with the entire components
of my apple pie.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.588
-I'm scared.
-Can I help you with anything?

16:04.672 --> 16:07.758
I just have to fill my apple.
Could just be here for moral support.

16:07.841 --> 16:08.842
Okay.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.053
I had eight of them,
and I only have three left,

16:11.136 --> 16:13.973
'cause I popped five trying to, um,

16:14.056 --> 16:16.308
just trying to smooth out the base.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.226
Yeah.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.064
And now,
I gotta stick a spoon in here,

16:22.564 --> 16:23.983
smooth it out.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.447
-Oh my God!

16:30.531 --> 16:32.491
-My boob.
-Relax.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.160
My boob popped my thing.
Now I have one left. It's okay.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.871
-Relax. Relax. You got this.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.457
Chefs, you have 30 minutes to go.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.750
Yes, Chef.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.008
Beautiful, Thiago.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.602
-Very good, Mellisa.
-I had a… I had a good teacher.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.149
Oh damn.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.776
One lens was too small, and it didn't fit.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.864
If you manipulate the glass,
don't use wet hands, huh?

17:11.947 --> 17:13.073
Yes, Chef.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.075
I was internally losing it.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.285
This is the last one,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.871
and he's gonna judge it
much harsher than anything else.

17:28.505 --> 17:32.009
Every challenge so far,
I was good until I wasn't.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.303
That was the problem.
Something always happened.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.389
Every pastry challenge,
something went south.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.767
But this time it worked.

17:40.434 --> 17:44.021
Thiago? I cannot believe it.
Are you actually done?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.732
Anybody need help?
Does anybody need help?

17:46.815 --> 17:47.983
Thiago finally showed up.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.943
-Does anybody need help?
-Wow!

17:50.027 --> 17:52.696
-Do you need help? For real?
-I'm good. I think I'm good.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.866
-Five minutes left, chefs.
-Yes, Chef.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.868
-Heard, Chef.
-Thank you.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.332
Okay, you have five minutes.
Clean me this one, Tyricia.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
Okay. Touch the glass,

18:06.001 --> 18:08.212
then you're gonna go around. Yeah.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.507
Melt it. Melt it. Slightly press on it.
Don't break it, though.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.424
Stop.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.842
Perfect. Okay.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.555
Yeah. That just happened.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.311
-One minute, chefs!
-Heard, Chef.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.277
Three, two,

18:32.861 --> 18:34.363
one, and this is over!

18:34.446 --> 18:36.657
-You feel good now?

18:37.157 --> 18:40.035
Finally. At least one thing done
that I can feel proud of.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.288
Chefs, please bring up your plates.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.514
Last pastry exercise,

19:00.597 --> 19:03.559
and I really, really love what I'm seeing.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.437
And I know
it's one of my hardest techniques

19:07.521 --> 19:09.064
to craft and to succeed at.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.694
I did not expect you to be there
that quickly, so I'm very, very pleased.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.487
Sir Thiago.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.489
Tell me a story.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.741
So, this is a rose for Caroline.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.034
Caroline is my wife.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.119
-Okay. I'm like…
-His wife.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.581
It's getting worse
and worse with you, Thiago.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.585
She's not big on getting flowers.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.171
She always yells at me,
'cause they're too expensive and die fast.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.048
So I wanted
to kind of embody the rose in the dome.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.385
It's very elegant.
It's very heartfelt.

19:38.468 --> 19:42.347
You have that nice,
shiny, even, almost no-bubble glaze.

19:42.431 --> 19:47.060
The sugar dome was melted to perfection
with no need of any seam to it,

19:47.144 --> 19:49.897
because it's perfectly flush,
and it's nice.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.232
-Is it gonna pop?
-Of course, Chef.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.530
Yeah.
Very thin. Very nice. Very dramatic.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.909
<i>Oh là là</i>. Yeah.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.999
The mousse is bomb.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.459
The sponge is moist.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.171
The <i>sablé</i> is just well cooked,

20:14.254 --> 20:16.798
with the raspberry texture flavor.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.301
Overall, it's a very, very nice cake.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.012
I'm very happy
you finally did this, Thiago.

20:22.095 --> 20:26.016
-Me too, Chef. Thank you.
-It's… it's very, very nice.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.061
I'm just happy with what I did.
I wanted to put something out

20:29.144 --> 20:30.604
that I'm proud of, and I finally did.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.899
-Stephanie.
-Okay.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.652
So I'm presenting to you
a deconstructed apple pie.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.946
It would've been nice
to see a beautiful apple.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.698
I did have, like,
five, still, before I started plating,

20:41.782 --> 20:46.328
and then once I started plating,
my boob hit two of them and cracked them.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.580
-And it… I reached over and…

20:48.664 --> 20:50.499
-It…
-Wrong place, wrong time.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.959
Yeah. But anyways…

20:52.042 --> 20:53.585
I'm judging this,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.212
but I'm judging this also.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.338
-Okay? So…
-Okay.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.299
Your sugar was very thin.
I was very pleased by it.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.551
I love that you… you… you train.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.554
-So, it was fun.
-Yeah. I want you to taste it.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.395
Great flavor.
It's rich. It's… it's generous.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.396
Overall, very good.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.523
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you, Stephanie.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.110
All right. Cedrick.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.699
So, I have for you
a very deep-red Anjou pear.

21:23.782 --> 21:28.328
I see a pear. I'm very glad
that the Cedrick I've met once

21:28.412 --> 21:29.830
is more open to try new things.

21:29.913 --> 21:30.747
Yes.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.666
I wish you would've given me
a little stem.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.876
-That would've been…
-Uh…

21:34.960 --> 21:37.921
Like, you take some chocolate,
you roll it real quick, you glue it.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.256
Can you, like, attach chocolate?

21:39.339 --> 21:40.299
-Yes.
-Okay.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.844
You melt it, glue it on, it's gonna stay
by itself. If it's thin enough.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.637
I want to go in.

21:47.055 --> 21:47.973
Ooh.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.310
It's pretty thin. It's pretty good.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.520
Let's try this.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.856
The inside is a very light vanilla mousse.

21:55.939 --> 22:00.193
I poached some pears,
and a very soft hazelnut sponge.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.489
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, you giggled.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.658
-I know what that means.
-It's great, Cedrick.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.744
-Thank you so much.
-Really great.

22:11.038 --> 22:11.997
Well, thank you.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.170
Very nice, smooth texture,
and the pears are fantastic.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.505
-Well, thank you, Chef.
-Thank you, Cedrick.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.132
Okay, Amanda.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.765
I have a lemon tart today
and a sugar dome.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.059
The dome is not perfectly round.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.519
You don't have bubbles.
It's pretty transparent.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.355
But it probably deflated.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.608
All your elements seem nice
and well put together,

22:39.691 --> 22:41.777
but it's lacking a little bit of that…

22:42.861 --> 22:43.779
Pizzazz.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.656
You played it
maybe this time a little bit too safe.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.574
Okay.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.118
I hope it… it kicks ass inside.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.665
So we are slightly thicker
but still acceptable.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.793
But let's try it.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.836
So you have almond <i>sablé</i>,

22:59.920 --> 23:03.715
a olive oil cake,
uh, lemon curd, meringue,

23:03.799 --> 23:06.009
uh, fresh raspberries, and lemon chip.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.346
It doesn't come as a surprise
it's overall a bit dry.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.263
Yeah.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.183
-That's it. Thank you, Amanda.
-Thanks, Chef. Thank you.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.560
Please, Tyricia.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.400
-What are you presenting us today?
-Chocolate raspberry.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.110
I have a entremet.

23:23.193 --> 23:26.071
Let's start
with the required exercise.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.281
-Right. Mm-hmm.
-Barely any bubbles.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.825
Perfect transparency.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.368
Perfectly round.

23:31.451 --> 23:35.372
The satisfying part is to see
how thin you were able to get the domes.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.333
Ah!

23:43.547 --> 23:46.716
Now, look at your texture.
Doesn't it look more sexy right now?

23:46.800 --> 23:49.344
-It looks so sexy.
-It's something I want to eat.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.595
Good.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.352
All the elements are good.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.522
It's exactly what I would expect
from raspberry and chocolate.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.693
It's a very good cake.
Very good cake, Tyricia.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.029
Now I can breathe. I wanna cry.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.532
-I'm, like, happy it's over.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.744
It's very satisfying
to see Tyricia from day one

24:14.828 --> 24:17.789
and Tyricia now is not the same person,
not the same professional.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.459
And I hope you… you realize that too,

24:20.542 --> 24:22.627
that within this experience,
you grew so much.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.629
Yes, Chef. I see it.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.590
-Thanks. Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.676
Daniel.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.306
I am presenting
a magnifying glass.

24:34.890 --> 24:41.146
You succeeded in the hardest parts of it,
which was making a very nice lens.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.814
Congratulations. It's well done.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.485
I really wish it would be attached.
For me, the illusion would be complete.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.737
But I'm very excited to try it.

24:51.948 --> 24:55.660
Whole thing is just caramel,
filling, cake, and the mousse.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.705
I like
that the hazelnut diplomat is light.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.874
I like that the sponge is soaked.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.751
They're all done right,

25:03.460 --> 25:04.878
and yet it doesn't make a cake.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.880
We have to keep in mind,

25:06.963 --> 25:09.799
pastry, taste is the fundamental.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.844
Yes, Chef. After this,
I'm just doing pastry for a while.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.722
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Like, a long time, it's just pastry.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.724
-Let me make it first before you.
-Okay.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.393
-So that I have a chance to do better.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.146
-That's my only thing.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.481
-I will.
-All right.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.650
Mellisa.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.695
-German cake, straight from America.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.947
-Yep. Exactly.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.075
This is extremely,
extremely traditional,

25:35.158 --> 25:36.993
and it requires craftsmanship.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.412
Did you actually use a ring to build it?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.039
No, I… I did it freehand.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.750
I do appreciate
seeing hand-piped something.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.210
It demonstrates skills.

25:45.293 --> 25:50.340
And it was a very good way
of hiding the seam of the sugar dome.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.384
Will it break? Will it pop?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.390
So we are a little bit thicker.
It's still acceptable.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.184
When I cut through this…

26:02.936 --> 26:04.145
Very well executed.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.523
It's very straight, and it's sexy.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.985
You see difference of texture,
you see difference of elements.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.659
It's good.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.079
You gave a somehow very modern twist

26:21.162 --> 26:23.373
on a very traditional American cake.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.834
-Thank you. Very nice.
-Thank you, Chef.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.127
Juan. Please.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.550
There is so much work involved
in this cake.

26:33.633 --> 26:37.429
The sphere is nice.
It's very transparent. There's no bubbles.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.473
I do love that you actually took the time
to make both techniques.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.397
Okay, so we are very thin.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.649
The glaze is well made.
It could be shinier.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.651
But at least
you really nailed the stripes.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.161
And there you go.
That's my ooze element.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.871
-Redemption.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.251
So the flavors are gonna be
the resemblance of a<i> café con leche</i>.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.048
-He's gonna laugh.
-Please.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.884
-He is. See, told ya.
-So that means you like it?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.346
It's <i>delicious.</i>

27:20.388 --> 27:22.265
I don't say this often. It's amazing.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.769
-It's very, very, very good.
-Wow.

27:25.852 --> 27:29.230
It's gonna be impossible
for me to judge this. Impossible.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.152
I've heard some of you said
it was the hardest exercise we had,

27:34.736 --> 27:38.531
yet you managed to finish everything,
you all really gave your best,

27:38.615 --> 27:40.075
so I'm quite pleased.

27:40.158 --> 27:43.078
It was very genuinely
a very difficult decision.

27:44.287 --> 27:48.792
I would like to acknowledge the work
of two individuals that for me sticks out.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.755
Juan…

27:55.090 --> 27:55.924
and Thiago.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.181
Thiago, I'm sure
that if you would have delivered

28:03.264 --> 28:06.101
a simpler version of Thiago
all the way through the course,

28:06.184 --> 28:08.812
you… you would've got this type of result.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.399
Finally getting a win, you know,
I think even Chef Amaury is like,

28:12.482 --> 28:16.069
"Yes! Finally.
I want you to go out on a high note."

28:16.152 --> 28:18.530
It was a good… it was a good… good day.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.785
Now, the serious thing starts.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.703
Oh God.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.580
Let's talk about
the total performance

28:27.664 --> 28:28.915
over the whole course.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.544
There have been two students
with overall top scores.

28:33.378 --> 28:38.049
The two top of the class
have won best exercise, best of the day.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.718
The most out of all of you,

28:41.010 --> 28:42.929
our two top achievers so far…

28:47.058 --> 28:48.059
Juan…

28:49.728 --> 28:50.770
I didn't believe it.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.690
Like, even though, like,
I know that I deserve it to be there,

28:53.773 --> 28:58.236
knowing that you're there, it definitely
puts way more pressure on you.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.154
…and…

29:03.408 --> 29:04.409
…Mellisa.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.416
Oh, I'm in the running!
In those few seconds of processing,

29:11.499 --> 29:14.961
I was like, "Oh yay.
I mean, yay. Yay, uh…"

29:15.044 --> 29:17.714
"Yay!" You know?

29:17.797 --> 29:19.799
So for the next chocolate exercise,

29:19.883 --> 29:23.011
you will be leading two teams of four.

29:23.094 --> 29:26.723
The chocolate exercise
will decide whether it's Juan or Mellisa

29:26.806 --> 29:29.768
that will be the top student
that will receive the award.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.311
Winner takes all.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.316
Isn't it exciting?

29:36.399 --> 29:38.777
-A good positive stress?

29:39.694 --> 29:43.114
I think he made the right choice.
They both were consistent,

29:43.198 --> 29:44.491
and they both really deserved it.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.076
And I'm glad
that it's kinda that way, you know?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.536
Let's help one of them win.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.290
-Well, cheers to Juan and Mellisa.
-Cheers to Juan and Mellisa!

29:52.373 --> 29:54.167
We can all agree
you both deserve it.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.586
-Thank you.
-Absolutely.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.214
When he said that,
"Yep, nope, it's Mellisa or Juan,"

29:59.297 --> 30:00.757
I… clearly, I was like, "Oh man."

30:00.840 --> 30:03.176
But I was like,
"You didn't do well in pastry."

30:03.259 --> 30:05.178
Yeah, I… I didn't deserve the win.

30:05.261 --> 30:08.223
So, Juan and Mellisa are,
you know, on the top of the ticket.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.349
-For sure.
-Yeah.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.811
So, four people working
on the showpiece.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.730
It must be massive.
It can't be small.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.067
It's gonna be me against Mellisa.
I definitely have a shot.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.946
It's like, "Get out of my way,
'cause I'm not… yeah, I'm not gonna stop."

30:23.029 --> 30:24.155
I am taking this home.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.449
I'm gonna have fun
with whoever I work with,

30:26.533 --> 30:28.284
'cause I've worked
with both of you before.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.663
And I'm gonna work my ass off
for you or for you.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.832
-Thank you.
-Whoever it's for.

30:34.332 --> 30:37.252
Juan has performed
really well through the class,

30:37.335 --> 30:41.214
so I was excited
to be going up against him.

30:41.297 --> 30:46.052
I totally know that I can do it,
and I just really need to deliver,

30:46.135 --> 30:47.971
because I really wanna win.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.766
All I've gotta say
is that if we can sculpt in this last one,

30:52.350 --> 30:55.728
it is still a showpiece round,
so I'd like to win four out of five.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.605
-Ooh.
-So whoever's team I'm on…

30:57.689 --> 31:00.775
-Whosever team I'm on…
-You ain't got friends like that.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.070
Whosever team I'm on,
like Thiago said,

31:04.153 --> 31:05.321
we're gonna give it our all.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.866
-Both of you deserve it.
-That's it. Cheers.

31:07.949 --> 31:08.783
Cheers!

31:08.867 --> 31:10.535
It's how we drink
in the kitchen.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.787
