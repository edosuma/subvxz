Oh, please. You miss her

Yeah, exactly.
So when do I get her back?

01:36.183 --> 01:37.662
these crazy-ass stories
about her mother.

You've been complaining
since he bought it.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.375
That's not how I remember it.

You said Adam has
no experience,

about what
a horrible mom you are,

mentioned it to you?

03:10.755 --> 03:12.627
We haven't spoken
in over a year.

03:12.757 --> 03:15.195
She asked for space,
and, being the healthy mother

03:15.325 --> 03:17.893
in recovery that I am,
I knew it was important

03:18.023 --> 03:19.286
to respect her wishes.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.551
And she changed her number.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.248

Really bad.

drunk off her ass,

03:41.133 --> 03:43.440

for stealing her car.

Turned out she left the car
at a 7-Eleven,

03:46.400 --> 03:48.663

while cleaning up the Slurpee

humiliating it was

she'll say something nice."

calls you the Life Preserver.

You can either keep
listening to the podcast

and feel for yourself, or
you could just call her.

Okay, you have
one choice.

How can I call her?
I don't even have her number.

in case you forgot--

05:30.852 --> 05:32.854

05:32.984 --> 05:35.204
Well, it's not called The
Grandmother of All Problems.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.032
In fact, you should

05:37.162 --> 05:39.382
call her from my phone.
That way she'll answer.

Well, that's exactly what...

07:39.110 --> 07:41.199
Okay.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.375
When I asked you
that very question,

07:43.506 --> 07:45.813
you confidently replied
that you have a dream

07:45.943 --> 07:47.379
that's important to you,

07:47.510 --> 07:49.947
and you want to feel like
your life has purpose again.

far bigger obstacles

has ever been able to say that.

They're gonna want to
be paid-- with money.

You're gonna make it work,

and you're not
gonna do it alone.

I wasn't gonna say anything,

09:15.772 --> 09:17.208
but I know who you are.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.254
You're the Mother
of All Problems.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.473
[quietly]:
Son of a bitch.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.738
How'd you find out?

09:24.868 --> 09:27.479
I guess you haven't listened
to today's podcast.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.005
VIOLET:
So, my mom left me a voice mail.

09:31.135 --> 09:34.530
I can't tell if it's sincere
or deeply manipulative.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.923
So you decide.

09:36.053 --> 09:36.924
Oh, no.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.752
CHRISTY:
Hi! Violet!

09:38.882 --> 09:42.364
It's me, your mom.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.410
So, um...

09:45.541 --> 09:46.934
doot-dah-doo...

09:47.064 --> 09:48.631
Turn it off.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.112
I... know this may not be
the best time to ask,

09:51.242 --> 09:53.636
but did you really take her
to a birthday party

09:53.767 --> 09:55.420
and not come back for two days?

09:55.551 --> 09:58.032
Yes. But the family
I left her with

09:58.162 --> 10:00.774
gave her sushi for the
first time that weekend.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.427
Does she mention that?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.561
I'm asking. Does
she mention that?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.476
[door closes in distance]Sorry.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.479
Wow. Stacy. Well,

10:10.610 --> 10:13.395
I got to tell you, you're back
and the motorcycle's back.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.876
If it's really not yours,
somebody's following you.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.052
Oh, my God,
you're the Life Preserver.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.141
Yes, I am.
Would you like a picture?

10:20.271 --> 10:21.316
Yes.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.839
Honey, do you mind?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.321
[sighs]

10:27.539 --> 10:29.193
Scrunch together.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.986
I thought I was leaving
that voice mail for one person,

10:39.116 --> 10:40.074
not everyone in the world.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.336
I have a question.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.859
What's "doot-dah-doo"?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.341
Not now, Jill.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.169
I thought when I got sober
all this stuff

10:48.299 --> 10:49.387
with Violet would get better.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.172
Well, you'vegotten better.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.827
You're not who you were,
and that's a big deal.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.611
I just wish she could see that.

10:55.742 --> 10:56.612
You should tell her.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.918
But in person.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.269
Doot-dah-do not
leave another message.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.445
What do you think, Marjorie?

11:03.575 --> 11:05.621
I might be
the wrong person to ask.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.450
I don't have a relationship
with my son.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.279
So all I can do is focus
on my sobriety

11:11.409 --> 11:13.803
and hope that one day
he'll forgive me.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.284
Oh, poo to that.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.940
My mom died before we were able
to figure out our stuff.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.333
Don't wait.
You could die, Christy.

11:23.857 --> 11:27.512
And call your son, 'cause you're
definitely gonna die before her.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.385
New bar opening this Friday.
Free wings with this flyer.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.126
New bar. Free wings.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.475
Flyer. Free.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.129
Wings. New.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.348
Where have you been?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.002
Trying to make sure
Adam doesn't go broke

11:39.133 --> 11:40.569
because of his stupid idea.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.484
But you said it was
a dream you shared.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.355
[groans]
Not how I remember it.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.663
You are each responsible

11:47.794 --> 11:49.970
for bringing ten people
to the opening.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.841
So, what'd I miss?

11:51.972 --> 11:53.277
My death is imminent.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.891
Jill and Wendy think
I should go see Violet.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.720
I agree.Even if I wanted to,
I don't know where she lives.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.373
I do. I mean, I could
probably figure it out.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.984
Okay, I've been there.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.953
This is the part
where you knock.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.129
I'm too nervous.
You do it.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.614
What the hell was that?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.964
I don't know.
You made me overthink it.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.620
Hi, Grandma.Violet. Mm!

12:31.751 --> 12:34.318
Hi, Violet.Hi.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.017
You weren't supposed to
tell her where I live.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.019
I'm sorry, but I was caught
in the middle,

12:39.149 --> 12:42.065
and my instinct
is always to heal.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.372
It's not Grandma's fault.
I made her tell me.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.983
Well, you're here,
so... come on in.

12:48.332 --> 12:51.640
Ah. Oh, this is a great setup.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.860
Luke must be doing well.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.862
Actually, Mom, Luke isn't
in the picture anymore.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.298
But thank you for assuming

12:57.428 --> 12:59.517
I couldn't pull this off
on my own.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.911
Strike one.You're doing great.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.220
So...

13:06.350 --> 13:09.005
you are obviously here
to talk about the podcast.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.224
Yes, I am.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.529
So...?

13:11.660 --> 13:13.053
So...

13:13.183 --> 13:14.881
I know you had
a difficult childhood,

13:15.011 --> 13:17.231
and I'm glad you found a way
to process it.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.755
I don't really need
your approval, but okay.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.107
Here's the thing
you need to know.[crunching]

13:28.416 --> 13:30.810
What? You know
I love pretzels.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.378
The person you've
been talking about

13:34.509 --> 13:37.599
isn't who I am anymore.
I've changed.

13:39.296 --> 13:42.822
[muffled]:
It's true, she has.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.868
But the podcast is about being
raised by an alcoholic mother,

13:45.999 --> 13:48.218
which I was--
the damage is already done.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.046
She's got you there.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.743
Well...

13:51.874 --> 13:54.311
can you at least tell
your listeners I'm sober now

13:54.442 --> 13:56.618
and trying to clean up
the mess I made?

13:56.748 --> 13:58.620
I got to say, that
seems reasonable.

13:58.750 --> 13:59.708
Okay.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.362
Thank you.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.539
Put these on,
talk into this,

14:04.669 --> 14:06.628
and if you're chewing
any gum, spit it out.

14:06.758 --> 14:07.890
What's happening?

14:08.021 --> 14:09.457
We're doing a podcast.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.328
If you want people to hear
your side, tell them.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.591
Oh. You can't just
do an episode called

14:13.722 --> 14:15.898
"My Mom's
Doin' Good Now"?No.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.249
Wait. This is all you need,
and you make money from it?

14:19.380 --> 14:20.468
Not a ton, but yeah.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.383
I am definitely
starting a podcast.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.559
Sober woman marrying
a guy in a wheelchair,

14:24.689 --> 14:27.344
sing a couple of songs--
something for everybody.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.738
And here we... go.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.740
I'm not ready.It's okay.
Take your time.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.524
Three, two, one.

14:33.655 --> 14:34.874
Hello, people.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.920
While I was deciding whether
or not to talk to my mom,

14:38.051 --> 14:40.575
she took that choice away
from me by showing up.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.533
So now here she is
with her side.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.407
That's you.
You're her mom.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.018
Um, okay.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.892
Hello.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.546
I, uh, I'm Christie,

14:55.677 --> 14:57.374
and, um...

14:57.505 --> 15:01.248
I'm Violet's, um, mom,

15:01.378 --> 15:02.989
and, um...

15:03.119 --> 15:05.817
Wait, I said "um" too much.
Can we start it again?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.341
No.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.038
Okay. Um...

15:10.735 --> 15:12.955
Well, I guess
if I'm gonna tell my side,

15:13.086 --> 15:14.696
I should start at the beginning.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.698
I was conceived in a van.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.700
Well, technically,
it was a minibus,

15:18.830 --> 15:20.441
and it was way more
normal for people

15:20.571 --> 15:22.399
to have sex in
vehicles back then.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.927
Also, this is Life Preserver.
Hello to all my fans.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.279
I'm actually sponsoring
three women.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.195
They call me with their
problems, and I help them.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.806
So what I'm trying
to say is yes,

15:37.937 --> 15:41.331
all those horrible stories
you've told about me are true.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.855
But... nowadays,
my idea of a good time

15:43.986 --> 15:46.946
is hitting a meeting and going
to coffee with my friends.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.036
I've changed.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.342
If I say I'm gonna
be somewhere, I'm there.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.519
I pay my bills.
I keep my promises.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.391
That's who I am now.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.263
Anyway...

16:00.394 --> 16:01.786
that's my side.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.180
Thanks for letting me tell it.

16:05.877 --> 16:09.055
First, I want to say, um...

16:09.185 --> 16:11.057
you sound really good.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.581
Clearly, you've done
a lot of work on yourself,

16:13.711 --> 16:15.278
and I'm happy for you.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.932
Thanks.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
But here's the thing.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.330
I missed out on being a child.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.943
When most kids were
just showing up to school

16:28.074 --> 16:29.858
and focusing on algebra,
I was always worried

16:29.989 --> 16:31.773
about what was going on at home.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.775
I could never
bring friends over,

16:33.905 --> 16:36.256
because I didn't know
what we would be walking into.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.258
When I should have
just been going to ballet

16:38.388 --> 16:39.824
and Rollerblading,

16:39.955 --> 16:41.957
I was the one that was home
cleaning the house

16:42.088 --> 16:44.220
and cooking dinner and
making sure that bills got paid.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.268
I would see you passed out
on the couch

16:48.398 --> 16:50.313
and not even know
if you were gonna wake up.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.795
I worried about stuff

16:53.925 --> 16:56.667
that no kid should
ever have to worry about.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.803
Violet, I am so sorry.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.892
I wish I could go back in time

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
and be the mother you deserved.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.855
I wish that, too.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.903
What do you say
we build from here?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.601
I really want to be
in your life.

17:17.732 --> 17:21.040
Actually, it's been really good
not having you in my life.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.740
I'm finally in a healthy place
right now, and I think

17:25.870 --> 17:27.437
that what would be best for me
is to not

17:27.568 --> 17:29.004
have a relationship with you.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.702
[softly]:
Oh.

17:31.833 --> 17:35.141
But thank you so much
for coming on the podcast.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.058
Okay.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.849
Seriously,
thank you for doing that.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.156
It's actually gonna be
a really good episode.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.723
So we're done?

17:52.854 --> 17:55.248
Yeah. It was great
to see you, Grandma.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.772
It's great to see
you, too, sweetie.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.165
Bye, Mom.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.775
Bye.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.223
You okay?Mm.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.661
[sighs]:
Mm.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.663
[both sigh]

18:19.794 --> 18:22.057
I know that's...

18:22.188 --> 18:25.887
not how you wanted that
to go down, but...

18:26.017 --> 18:28.585
remember...

18:28.716 --> 18:30.239
five years ago,

18:30.370 --> 18:32.589
this right here wouldn't
have been possible.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.430
♪

18:49.432 --> 18:52.131
I'm sure you'd
rather be at home

18:52.261 --> 18:53.480
curled up in the
fetal position,

18:53.610 --> 18:55.743
watching The Real
Housewives of...

18:55.873 --> 18:57.223
somewhere...

18:57.353 --> 19:00.095
but it means a lot to me
that you showed up.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.793
It's okay. Kind of
like the old days,

19:02.924 --> 19:05.796
only now I'm drowning
my sorrows in hot wings.[chuckles]

19:05.927 --> 19:07.189
And these are hot.Yeah.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.713
I actually can't
feel my lips.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.150
You know...

19:11.280 --> 19:13.108
the podcast
hasn't aired yet.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.110
I could break into
Violet's apartment,

19:15.241 --> 19:17.068
destroy the tapes--
problem solved.

19:17.199 --> 19:20.985
First of all,
no one uses tapes anymore.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.640
And also, I don't want
to destroy the podcast.

19:23.771 --> 19:27.122
It's helping her.
And probably other people.

19:27.253 --> 19:30.778
Ah, look at you, eating chicken
and taking the high road.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.607
You know...

19:33.737 --> 19:36.871
all of this has made me realize
I owe you an apology.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.438
Awesome.

19:38.568 --> 19:39.787
Why?

19:39.917 --> 19:42.398
Because I focused too much
on who you were

19:42.529 --> 19:45.575
and not enough on the person
you've become. I'm sorry.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.925
Aw. Thank you.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.492
So from here on out,

19:49.623 --> 19:51.799
I promise I will
only get mad at you

19:51.929 --> 19:53.627
for the things you do
in the present.

19:53.757 --> 19:57.239
And I promise to give you
plenty to work with.

Hey.
You use the urinal?

20:01.809 --> 20:02.636
Yeah.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.812
Were you happy
with the trajectory?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.684
I guess.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.034
Hot guy says yes.

Mr. Successful Bar Owner.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.607

Look at all the people.

20:17.738 --> 20:18.956
Yeah, yeah, big turnout.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.044
I did that.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.394
Yes, you did.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.874

75 sober people to a bar.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.008
I'm running out of Diet Coke.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.489
Also, next time you
promise everyone free wings,

20:29.619 --> 20:30.968

20:37.148 --> 20:39.542
An iced tea.
Me too.Cranberry juice.

20:39.673 --> 20:43.154
I don't have an infection.
I just like it.

20:44.634 --> 20:47.550
I sunk my life savings
into a lemonade stand.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.597
Okay, so, a guy
asked me for my number.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.034
I have a date. Or he wants me
to do work on his house.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.340
