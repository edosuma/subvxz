WEBVTT

00:01.553 --> 00:04.245
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.383 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.839
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.977 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.876 --> 00:17.776
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.914 --> 00:21.745
We've finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.506 --> 00:25.956
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.095 --> 00:28.683
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.821 --> 00:31.100
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.238 --> 00:33.930
Just to get up that hill

00:34.068 --> 00:36.519
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.657 --> 00:39.073
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.211 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.250
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.388 --> 00:46.218
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.356 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.674
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.812 --> 00:56.366
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.504 --> 00:59.714
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.852 --> 01:04.167
We've finally got
a piece of the pie

01:10.000 --> 01:11.726
But, George,
you promised.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.453
You promised me
you'd slow down.

01:14.591 --> 01:17.594
You know, all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.355
As usual, you're
half right, Weezy.

01:19.493 --> 01:22.461
All work and no play
makes jack.

01:23.497 --> 01:25.223
But what do you
need more money for?

01:25.361 --> 01:27.363
You never have time
to spend it.

01:27.501 --> 01:29.986
You didn't get home
until 2:00 this morning.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.747
And it's been like that
every day this week.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.681
Now, you've just
got to slow down.

01:36.372 --> 01:37.821
You're right, Weezy.

01:37.959 --> 01:41.170
I'm going to start
slowing down right now.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.481
Good.

01:48.073 --> 01:49.799
Oh, it's no use
trying to talk to you.

01:49.937 --> 01:51.490
I'm going to
take my shower.

01:53.078 --> 01:54.735
Wonderful.
It's good for the nerves.

01:54.873 --> 01:56.771
You go take
a nice long shower.

02:01.604 --> 02:02.984
Hello, Abernathy?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.710
Now, this is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

02:04.848 --> 02:07.092
What? No, this ain't
no obscene phone call.

02:07.230 --> 02:08.921
This is Jefferson.

02:10.751 --> 02:12.615
I'm whispering because
my wife is taking a shower

02:12.753 --> 02:14.237
and I don't want
to disturb her.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.032
Now, about this
new store I'm opening,
I want it to be...

02:16.170 --> 02:19.104
LOUISE:
George, all I want
is a straight answer.

02:19.242 --> 02:20.761
Call you later.

02:24.351 --> 02:26.491
You are keeping
your promise, aren't you?

02:26.629 --> 02:27.940
Sure I am.

02:28.078 --> 02:29.218
What promise?

02:30.840 --> 02:33.153
You promised to spend
more time at home

02:33.291 --> 02:35.638
and not open up
any more new stores.

02:35.776 --> 02:37.087
Yeah, that's right, Weezy.

02:37.226 --> 02:38.779
I did promise that.
You're absolutely right.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.574
You know, you got
a great memory, Weez.

02:40.712 --> 02:41.782
Mwah!

02:42.817 --> 02:44.854
George, look me
in the eye.

02:48.064 --> 02:51.067
Are you opening new stores
behind my back?

02:51.619 --> 02:52.896
Weezy!

02:53.034 --> 02:55.865
Because I've had
too many broken promises.

02:56.003 --> 02:58.523
And if you break this one,
we are through.

02:58.661 --> 03:00.421
Now answer my question.

03:00.559 --> 03:02.699
I'm going to answer
that question.

03:02.837 --> 03:05.150
But first,
I'm gonna ask you one.

03:05.288 --> 03:06.945
Do you know how much
it would hurt me

03:07.083 --> 03:09.085
if it turns out that my wife,
who says she loves me,

03:09.223 --> 03:10.397
doesn't trust me?

03:10.535 --> 03:12.261
I didn't say
I didn't trust you...

03:12.399 --> 03:13.779
So if you want me
to answer that question,

03:13.917 --> 03:15.505
I'll be glad
to answer it.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.612
But if you ask me
that question,

03:18.750 --> 03:20.648
that means that
you're saying
that I'm lying.

03:20.786 --> 03:22.581
I never said that.

03:23.272 --> 03:24.376
I'm glad.

03:24.514 --> 03:26.344
And I'm willing to
forget the whole thing.

03:32.142 --> 03:33.765
Oh, well,
thank you, George.

03:33.903 --> 03:35.801
Now, I'll take
my shower.

03:35.939 --> 03:37.458
Then we'll have
breakfast together.

03:37.596 --> 03:39.667
You can get
to work a little later
this morning, can't you?

03:39.805 --> 03:42.360
Sure! After all,
I'm the boss, ain't I?

03:42.498 --> 03:44.224
I can get there
any time I feel like.

03:44.362 --> 03:45.604
I can take it easy.

03:45.742 --> 03:47.261
I got to call Abernathy!

03:48.711 --> 03:49.988
Damn it!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.922
Bentley.
What happened to you?

03:53.060 --> 03:55.373
Love, Mr. J. Love.

03:55.511 --> 03:56.684
Must have been
a hell of a woman,

03:56.822 --> 03:58.790
because she sure
put a hurting on you.

03:59.929 --> 04:02.138
Oh, no, this happened
in the kitchen.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.105
I fell and broke
my acetabulum.

04:05.969 --> 04:08.213
Your what?
My acetabulum.

04:08.351 --> 04:10.560
I know where it is.

04:10.698 --> 04:13.287
I just never heard it called
by its whole name before.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.638
No, actually,
it's the pelvic socket.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.157
But it doesn't
hurt a bit.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.815
Then why are you
ringing my doorbell
at 7:30 in the morning?

04:23.953 --> 04:25.886
My goodness!
Is it 7:30 already?

04:26.024 --> 04:27.508
You know, when I'm
thinking about Adele,

04:27.646 --> 04:29.476
the time
just flies by.

04:29.614 --> 04:31.132
This is the real thing,
Mr. J.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.824
It's love.
Mmm-hmm.

04:32.962 --> 04:34.929
You say that every time
a chick stays over
in your apartment.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.172
Ah, but Adele
is different.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.933
She refused to stay over
in my apartment.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.074
She's so...so...

04:42.212 --> 04:43.352
What am I trying to say?

04:43.490 --> 04:45.215
"Goodbye"?

04:45.354 --> 04:48.357
No. No, uh, sincere.
That's the word. So sincere.

04:48.495 --> 04:49.772
Good. Well, why don't
you go tell her?

04:49.910 --> 04:52.153
Actually, "Sincere"
is a very interesting word.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.224
Not as interesting
as "Goodbye."

04:54.363 --> 04:56.572
It means
"Without wax."

04:56.710 --> 04:58.850
It comes from the Latin
"Sine,"meaning "Without"

04:58.988 --> 05:00.369
and "Cere,"meaning "Wax."

05:00.507 --> 05:02.302
Would you like
to know why?
No.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.545
In Ancient Rome,
there were
these charlatans

05:04.683 --> 05:07.272
who used to take advantage
of unsuspecting builders

05:07.410 --> 05:09.101
by selling them
cheap marble columns

05:09.239 --> 05:11.345
which had been hollowed out
and filled with wax.

05:11.483 --> 05:14.003
Therefore, a marble column
that was not filled with wax

05:14.141 --> 05:18.248
was worth a lot more
because it was
"Sine" "Cere,""Without wax."

05:18.870 --> 05:20.320
God, that's fascinating!

05:22.183 --> 05:23.702
Anyway,

05:23.840 --> 05:26.256
the word "Sincere"
is the perfect word
to describe Adele.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.880
Well, I'm real glad
your girl got rid of
all of her wax, Bentley.

05:29.915 --> 05:31.676
Now, if you'll excuse me...

05:31.814 --> 05:34.299
No, no.
I came here
to beg a favor.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.750
Could I please have
this best blazer of mine

05:36.888 --> 05:38.545
cleaned by 5:00 tonight?

05:38.683 --> 05:39.787
Why are you
in such a rush?

05:39.925 --> 05:41.617
Is this the only
blazer you got?
No.

05:41.755 --> 05:43.101
But I'm meeting
Adele tonight.

05:43.239 --> 05:46.173
And I was wearing that blazer
the first time we met.

05:46.311 --> 05:48.175
You're afraid
she won't recognize you

05:48.313 --> 05:50.280
if you're not
wearing it, huh?

05:50.419 --> 05:53.111
Oh, no, she'd recognize me
even if I were
wearing nothing.

05:53.249 --> 05:54.423
Ho-ho-ho!

05:55.493 --> 05:57.805
I mean, no matter
what I was wearing.

05:58.772 --> 06:00.394
This came from
Adele yesterday.

06:01.947 --> 06:03.432
Ah, Aphrodite!

06:04.329 --> 06:05.779
"Afro-didee"?

06:07.194 --> 06:08.713
You going with
a black chick?

06:13.614 --> 06:16.548
No. Aphrodite.
That's Adele's perfume.

06:16.686 --> 06:18.205
35 dollars an ounce.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.794
It's almost as seductive
as her poetry.

06:20.932 --> 06:22.451
Here, I want you
to read this.

06:22.589 --> 06:25.177
Bentley, I don't even
have time to smell it.

06:25.315 --> 06:26.420
George Jefferson
speaking.

06:26.558 --> 06:28.077
Hey, Abernathy!

06:28.215 --> 06:30.079
Look,
I'm sorry I had to
hang up on you before.

06:30.217 --> 06:31.598
My wife is
catching on.

06:31.736 --> 06:33.738
Oh, I think
I better go, Mr. J.

06:33.876 --> 06:35.809
Now, look here.
About this new store.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.224
It's got to be
open by next week.

06:37.362 --> 06:38.501
I already paid
for the ads.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.641
I'll let myself out, okay?

06:40.779 --> 06:42.850
Thank you very much
for everything.
Shut up!

06:44.818 --> 06:47.372
Listen, Abernathy.
We can work out
these problems Tuesday.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.856
I don't care if it does
take all night!

06:48.994 --> 06:50.755
I can't hold out on my wife
much longer.

06:50.893 --> 06:52.619
Of course she's going to
find out about the new store.

06:52.757 --> 06:54.448
But by Tuesday,
it will be too late.

06:54.586 --> 06:57.175
Look, don't tell me
what to do! I know
how to run my business.

06:57.313 --> 06:59.384
George, who are
you talking to?

06:59.522 --> 07:01.662
Nobody. I was just
getting the weather report.

07:03.699 --> 07:05.839
But you sounded like
you were arguing.

07:05.977 --> 07:07.841
And the weather report
is a recording.

07:07.979 --> 07:09.359
I don't care
if it is a recording!

07:09.498 --> 07:10.775
If they're wrong,
they're wrong!

07:11.707 --> 07:12.811
See you later.

07:12.949 --> 07:14.261
George!

07:14.399 --> 07:15.918
George!

07:16.056 --> 07:18.092
Oh, George,
you forgot something.

07:21.337 --> 07:23.097
"Dear Lover Man."

07:25.721 --> 07:27.619
"Dear Lover Man"!

07:32.175 --> 07:34.315
I'm reading this,
but I don't believe it.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.938
Oh, you can
believe it, all right.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.561
It's been going on
right under my nose.

07:38.699 --> 07:40.425
And I was too stupid
to see it.

07:40.563 --> 07:42.427
Louise, it won't do you
any good to get upset.

07:42.565 --> 07:44.705
There could be
a logical explanation.

07:54.301 --> 07:55.958
But it better be a good one.

07:58.236 --> 07:59.306
I'll kill him.

07:59.444 --> 08:01.308
That's what I'll do.
I'll kill him!

08:01.446 --> 08:03.310
Take it easy, Louise.

08:03.448 --> 08:05.139
First give him
a chance to explain.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.278
I agree.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.039
The two of you
should sit down together

08:08.177 --> 08:11.076
and talk this thing over
calmly and rationally.

08:11.214 --> 08:15.184
That's true. I should hear
his side of the story first.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.151
Then I'll kill him!

08:18.083 --> 08:20.327
Louise, I am
surprised at you.

08:20.465 --> 08:21.742
You're a mature woman.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.848
You should handle this
in a mature way.

08:23.986 --> 08:26.402
That's right. I'll get
somebody else to kill him.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.576
Thanks, you two.

08:27.714 --> 08:28.887
Wait a minute, Louise.

08:29.025 --> 08:30.544
Helen has a very good point.

08:30.682 --> 08:33.996
Oh, you want me
to overlook everything
that's gone on

08:34.134 --> 08:35.963
and behave like
nothing's happened?

08:36.101 --> 08:37.378
Never!

08:37.517 --> 08:39.726
Just because George is having
a middle-aged fling,

08:39.864 --> 08:42.176
that's no reason
to chuck everything out.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.076
I'm not going to
chuck everything out.

08:45.214 --> 08:46.491
Just George!

08:47.803 --> 08:49.459
You really shouldn't
get so upset.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.289
This sort of thing
is very common.

08:51.427 --> 08:53.084
It happens to lots of men.

08:53.222 --> 08:55.535
It's really
very understandable.

08:58.227 --> 09:00.919
Understandable to
some people. Not to me.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.791
Listen, Louise.

09:10.929 --> 09:13.932
You know George loves you,
even if he strays a little.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.969
How little
is "little"?

09:16.107 --> 09:18.523
Louise, the point is
he'll be back.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.734
Well, maybe
you're right.

09:22.872 --> 09:25.772
Even if I'm not,
it's worth a try.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.740
Look, girl,
you've got 25 years
of marriage behind you.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.673
Are you ready to
throw all that away?

09:31.640 --> 09:33.124
No!

09:34.332 --> 09:36.679
I still love him!

09:36.817 --> 09:38.888
So what are you
going to do?

09:40.510 --> 09:42.236
I'm going to act mature.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.583
Right.

09:43.721 --> 09:46.413
And everything is
going to work out okay.

09:46.551 --> 09:48.001
Now, you just go
powder your nose

09:48.139 --> 09:50.141
while I pour you
another cup of coffee.

09:50.279 --> 09:52.074
Thanks, Helen, Tom.

09:52.212 --> 09:54.663
I don't know
what I'd do
without you two.

09:56.941 --> 09:59.219
Helen, I'm proud of you.

09:59.357 --> 10:01.186
Do you realize
what you've done?

10:01.324 --> 10:02.878
You've saved their marriage.

10:03.016 --> 10:04.949
You've kept Louise
and George together.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.675
Yeah.

10:06.813 --> 10:09.229
Too bad I couldn't
have done something
nice for her instead.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.362
All right, George.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.881
What have you got
to say for yourself?

11:50.019 --> 11:51.987
Oh, good morning, love.
Sorry I woke you up.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.989
I had to get up early.

12:06.691 --> 12:08.624
It's no good, George.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.765
I know where you've been
and what you've been doing.

12:11.903 --> 12:13.111
You do?

12:13.249 --> 12:15.079
Of course I do.
You think I'm blind?

12:15.217 --> 12:17.460
Now, take it easy, Weezy.
I can explain everything.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.359
Try.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.016
Look, before I go
any further,

12:21.154 --> 12:23.121
I want you to know
that I've been doing it
for both of us.

12:27.643 --> 12:28.817
You what?

12:28.955 --> 12:30.473
And it ain't been easy.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.167
I'll bet!

12:34.305 --> 12:35.444
You don't understand.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.204
I understand
everything.

12:37.342 --> 12:40.207
All those late hours
and mysterious phone calls,

12:40.345 --> 12:41.450
tired all the time.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.762
Now, look, honey...

12:42.900 --> 12:44.764
You save that "honey"
for your other woman.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.629
What other woman?
Don't try to
act innocent.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.562
You've got
another woman.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.081
Another woman?

12:52.219 --> 12:56.396
Don't deny it.
You're having
a middle-aged fling.

12:56.534 --> 12:58.605
It happens
to lots of men.

12:58.743 --> 12:59.986
I can understand that.

13:00.469 --> 13:01.988
Oh, you can?

13:03.265 --> 13:04.369
Certainly.

13:04.507 --> 13:06.786
And I'm mature enough
to take it.

13:06.924 --> 13:08.132
Oh, you are?

13:08.270 --> 13:10.582
Well, in that case,
you're right.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.929
It is another woman.

13:26.081 --> 13:27.910
You all through
being mature now?

13:29.567 --> 13:30.982
Oh, George, I'm sorry.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.397
I lost my head.

13:32.535 --> 13:33.951
Yeah, you nearly
lost mine too.

13:35.711 --> 13:37.092
Oh, but I'm all right now.

13:37.230 --> 13:38.334
Good.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.510
Uh, is she pretty?

13:42.097 --> 13:43.408
No! Ugly.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.516
And old too.

13:47.654 --> 13:49.069
She's even older than you.

13:51.554 --> 13:52.728
What?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.006
Oh, believe me, Weezy,
it's nothing.

13:55.144 --> 13:57.043
Not according to Adele.

13:57.595 --> 13:58.768
Who's Adele?

13:58.907 --> 14:00.632
Now, don't try
to cover up
for her, George.

14:00.770 --> 14:02.876
I know her name
is Adele.

14:03.014 --> 14:05.430
It says so in the letter
she wrote to you.

14:05.568 --> 14:07.674
Oh, you mean Adele.

14:07.812 --> 14:08.917
Yes.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.748
Adele, and her
cheap perfume.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.233
That ain't cheap.
That's 35 bucks an ounce.

14:15.371 --> 14:16.579
"Afro-didee."

14:18.236 --> 14:21.205
I suppose she's got
a great body too.

14:21.343 --> 14:23.621
Yeah, she probably does.

14:23.759 --> 14:26.210
What?
But no better
than yours, Weezy.

14:26.348 --> 14:27.625
Then why?

14:27.763 --> 14:29.765
Don't tell me!
I don't want to
hear any more.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.905
Good.

14:32.043 --> 14:34.632
How old is she?
What does she look like?
Where does she live?

14:36.220 --> 14:38.015
I thought you didn't
want to hear any more.

14:38.153 --> 14:39.740
Listen, George.

14:41.984 --> 14:44.987
George,
we are not children,

14:45.125 --> 14:46.747
and we are not
going to do anything

14:46.886 --> 14:48.715
that we'll be
sorry for later.

14:48.853 --> 14:50.234
I'm sure glad
to hear that.

14:53.306 --> 14:54.894
We are going
to be calm.

14:55.032 --> 14:56.965
We are going
to be mature.

14:57.103 --> 14:58.311
We are going
to be sensible.

14:58.449 --> 14:59.933
Right on.

15:00.071 --> 15:02.418
And we are going to
get rid of that woman!

15:02.556 --> 15:05.076
Right.
And you'll do it today.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.360
How about next Tuesday?

15:16.432 --> 15:19.194
What?
Well, I can't do it
just like that.

15:19.332 --> 15:21.196
I mean, there's
a lot of details
have to be worked out

15:21.334 --> 15:22.680
between now
and next Tuesday.

15:22.818 --> 15:26.926
And you expect me
to sit here
until next Tuesday

15:27.064 --> 15:29.411
while you're going out
with another woman?

15:29.549 --> 15:30.930
You can handle it, Weez.

15:34.485 --> 15:35.762
How?

15:35.900 --> 15:39.352
Well, like you said.
By being calm,
mature and sensible.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.250
I'm hungry. I think
I'll go grab a sandwich.

15:45.841 --> 15:47.325
I should've killed him.

15:52.503 --> 15:54.505
You've got gravy
on your chin.

15:56.817 --> 15:58.716
George, Tuesday
is almost over

15:58.854 --> 16:00.580
and you've still got
something to do.

16:00.718 --> 16:02.444
Can't you eat
any faster than that?

16:03.790 --> 16:06.172
I'm eating so fast now
I keep missing my mouth.

16:08.174 --> 16:09.209
I gotta go.

16:09.347 --> 16:11.522
You mean
you aren't gonna
stay for dessert?

16:11.660 --> 16:13.973
No. He's giving up
his sugar.

16:20.255 --> 16:21.566
Aren't you, George?

16:21.704 --> 16:22.809
Ha, ha, ha.

16:22.947 --> 16:24.466
Your mother likes
to make jokes.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.847
I just got a deadline
to meet, that's all.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.332
What's he mean,
he's got a deadline?

16:28.470 --> 16:31.852
He means he's going to be dead
if he don't toe the line.

16:33.268 --> 16:35.028
Funny, Weezy. Funny.

16:36.305 --> 16:38.514
Come on, Mom.
Now, what's Pop
done this time?

16:38.652 --> 16:40.723
I don't want to
talk about it.

16:40.861 --> 16:42.484
Oh, well, then
it can't be too bad.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.969
Hey, Jenny, every time
mom can't get her own way,

16:45.107 --> 16:46.729
she likes to take it out
on poor Pop.

16:47.351 --> 16:48.352
Poor Pop?

16:48.490 --> 16:50.319
Mom just likes
to blow off steam.

16:50.457 --> 16:51.562
It's probably nothing.

16:52.183 --> 16:53.253
Nothing?

16:53.391 --> 16:55.807
You think he's going out
on business tonight.

16:55.945 --> 16:57.223
Wrong!

16:57.361 --> 16:59.018
He's stepping out on me.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.538
Mom, that's crazy.

17:02.676 --> 17:04.471
You ought to know Pop
better than that.

17:04.609 --> 17:06.335
Now, just because
he hasn't been
hanging around the house

17:06.473 --> 17:08.613
doesn't mean
he's going out
with another woman.

17:08.751 --> 17:11.133
I mean, the man is
probably off opening up
another store, or...

17:11.271 --> 17:12.997
Don't argue
with your mother!

17:15.827 --> 17:17.105
If she says I'm going out
with another woman,

17:17.243 --> 17:19.038
I'm going out
with another woman.

17:19.176 --> 17:20.970
Bye, y'all.
Have a nice evening.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.598
Is this for real?

17:28.978 --> 17:31.636
I told you I don't
want to talk about it.

17:31.774 --> 17:33.224
But maybe we can help.

17:33.362 --> 17:34.605
I don't understand
all this.

17:34.743 --> 17:36.469
Mom, now,
what's happening?

17:36.607 --> 17:38.126
It's all very simple.

17:38.264 --> 17:39.748
And I'll tell you.

17:40.507 --> 17:42.509
Your father, he...

17:46.582 --> 17:48.826
And there was a letter...

17:52.209 --> 17:54.694
And then
the beautiful perfume.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.835
35 dollars an ounce!

18:00.389 --> 18:04.980
And then I went upstairs
to see Tom and Helen.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.534
And they said...

18:07.672 --> 18:09.605
Very mature!

18:18.338 --> 18:20.478
And now, now
I don't know what to do...

18:23.481 --> 18:25.104
Now do you understand?

18:35.183 --> 18:38.013
Uh, let's take
a walk, huh?

18:38.151 --> 18:40.015
Yeah. I could
do with some air.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.121
You know, I don't
believe all this!

18:42.259 --> 18:43.984
Jenny, what's happened
to my father?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.055
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Come on.

18:46.194 --> 18:49.058
This is 1976, and things
like this happen all the time.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.198
Hmm.

18:50.336 --> 18:51.475
I mean, look.

18:51.613 --> 18:55.203
Your parents, they've been
married for 25 years.

18:55.341 --> 18:57.412
Now, what's one
little episode, huh?

18:57.550 --> 19:01.657
So your father,
he strayed a little bit.
But he'll be back.

19:01.795 --> 19:05.247
What they should do
is keep an open line
of communication.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.836
Talk to each other
instead of yelling.

19:07.974 --> 19:10.735
I mean, it's really just
a matter of understanding.

19:10.873 --> 19:13.359
Jenny,
you're beautiful.

19:13.497 --> 19:16.016
And if you ever do that to me,
I'll break your neck.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.263
Hi, Louise.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.092
I hope you don't mind
my dropping in like this.

19:23.231 --> 19:26.234
Of course not.
I'd appreciate the company.

19:26.372 --> 19:27.856
Would you like a drink?

19:27.994 --> 19:29.892
It depends.
On what?

19:30.030 --> 19:31.446
On whether you're serving
the good Scotch

19:31.584 --> 19:33.862
or that cheap stuff that
George saves for Tom and me.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.075
Oh, it's so nice
to laugh again.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.871
Everything all right
between you and George?

19:43.009 --> 19:45.045
We're handling it.
Good.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.357
I knew
you could do it.

19:47.116 --> 19:48.566
By the way, where is George?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.637
He's out on a date.

19:50.775 --> 19:52.018
What?

19:52.156 --> 19:54.296
Well, not just
any date.

19:54.434 --> 19:58.024
He's saying goodbye
to, uh, whatshername.

19:58.162 --> 19:59.853
You mean he's still
been seeing her?

19:59.991 --> 20:01.821
Well, yes.

20:01.959 --> 20:05.549
George felt that he wanted
time to let her down easy.

20:05.687 --> 20:07.206
He didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

20:07.344 --> 20:10.139
Her feelings?
What about your feelings?

20:10.278 --> 20:11.382
What are you supposed to do?

20:11.520 --> 20:13.764
Hang around until he
gets tired of playing?

20:13.902 --> 20:16.905
Well, I'm only
following your advice.

20:17.043 --> 20:19.701
Taking your mature approach.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.530
I'm fine.

20:26.673 --> 20:27.916
Now, look, Louise.

20:28.054 --> 20:29.297
My advice didn't include

20:29.435 --> 20:31.506
living in the same house
with a Casanova

20:31.644 --> 20:34.163
who's chasing all over town
with some other woman.

20:34.302 --> 20:37.132
Imagine, after 25 years.
It's not fair.

20:38.064 --> 20:40.756
Who says it's supposed
to be fair?

20:40.894 --> 20:43.897
So I'm getting
the worst of the bargain.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.865
But that's okay.

20:46.003 --> 20:49.455
True, I've given
25 years of my life.

20:50.732 --> 20:54.287
Twenty-five
of the best years.

20:54.425 --> 20:55.530
To that shrimp.

20:58.084 --> 20:59.258
Yeah.

20:59.396 --> 21:00.983
To that shrimp!

21:01.605 --> 21:03.227
You deserve better, Louise.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.160
You damn right, I do.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.101
How could I
have been so stupid?

21:15.239 --> 21:18.000
Why do I have to be the one
who give, give, give

21:18.138 --> 21:19.623
and never get
anything in return?

21:19.761 --> 21:21.659
Why should I be
the one who suffers?

21:21.797 --> 21:22.764
You don't.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.283
You're right!

21:24.421 --> 21:26.561
This time he's gone too far.

21:27.838 --> 21:29.598
You know what
I'm going to do to that man?

21:29.736 --> 21:31.359
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do to...

21:31.497 --> 21:33.188
Hey, Weez.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.915
You little sex fiend!

21:41.955 --> 21:43.025
Say what?

21:43.163 --> 21:45.856
You think you can
just take my love

21:45.994 --> 21:48.341
and trample it
on the ground?

21:49.342 --> 21:51.827
Walk in and out of here
as you please?

21:51.965 --> 21:53.415
Well, you can't!

21:53.553 --> 21:55.417
I've had all I can stand.

21:55.555 --> 21:58.144
We are through,
George, through!

21:58.282 --> 22:01.009
Wait a minute, Weezy.
Don't you touch this girl!

22:04.253 --> 22:06.773
Get out of my way.
Don't you touch my friend.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.812
I think you're both touched.

22:13.193 --> 22:15.195
I'll give you
a choice, George.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.682
Either you move out
or I move out.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.994
You gotta be kidding!
No, she's not.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.411
You can stay at our place
tonight if you like.

22:23.549 --> 22:25.413
Thank you.
I'll go get my toothbrush.

22:25.551 --> 22:27.276
Now, wait a minute.

22:27.415 --> 22:28.864
You're touching me!

22:31.108 --> 22:32.385
Look, Weezy,
there's no other woman.

22:32.523 --> 22:33.524
I just made that up.

22:33.662 --> 22:34.801
Hah!

22:34.939 --> 22:36.285
Hah!

22:36.424 --> 22:38.702
Will you stop
listening to her?

22:38.840 --> 22:41.221
I'm telling you
there ain't no other woman.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.328
And I suppose you wrote
that love letter to yourself.

22:44.466 --> 22:45.433
No!

22:45.571 --> 22:47.020
Then who wrote it?
Adele.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.574
BOTH: Aha!

22:50.714 --> 22:53.268
Look, you don't
understand.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.547
I hate to
trouble you...
Go away!

22:57.514 --> 22:59.101
Weezy, you've got
to believe me.

22:59.239 --> 23:00.724
There is no
other woman.

23:00.862 --> 23:02.829
That love letter
you're talking about
belongs to Bentley.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.244
Bentley! Bentley!

23:04.383 --> 23:05.832
Hey! Where are
you going?

23:05.970 --> 23:07.213
Away.

23:07.351 --> 23:08.456
Why are you being
so unfriendly?

23:08.594 --> 23:11.355
Ringing the bell
and walking off like that.

23:11.493 --> 23:14.185
But...
Look, just tell my wife
about that letter.

23:14.323 --> 23:15.773
Oh, yes, that's what
I came to ask you about.

23:15.911 --> 23:17.637
Do you have it?
She's got it.

23:17.775 --> 23:20.606
Oh, good. I'll bet
you enjoyed reading it.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.021
No, I didn't.

23:22.159 --> 23:24.023
Really? I think
Adele writes very well.

23:24.161 --> 23:25.542
You see? Adele is his girl.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.267
I mean,
"Dear Lover Man."

23:27.406 --> 23:29.580
That's got quite
a ring to it, hasn't it?

23:30.132 --> 23:31.893
You mean it's true?

23:32.031 --> 23:33.377
There is no other woman?

23:33.515 --> 23:35.137
Would I lie to you?

23:36.863 --> 23:40.488
Oh, George,
can you ever forgive me?

23:41.212 --> 23:42.386
I'll try.

23:46.666 --> 23:48.599
I should have known better.

23:48.737 --> 23:50.359
And I should've told you
that I was staying out late

23:50.498 --> 23:52.085
because I was
opening another store.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.432
Yeah.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.507
Another store?

23:59.645 --> 24:01.060
That's better
than another woman.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.165
Another store!

24:03.303 --> 24:05.167
Wait, wait.
Be mature, Weezy.

24:05.305 --> 24:06.755
You lied to me!

24:08.136 --> 24:10.552
And sometimes she calls me
her little Limey bean.

24:11.139 --> 24:12.243
George, I'll kill you.

24:12.381 --> 24:14.176
I'll kill you, George!

24:14.314 --> 24:15.488
BENTLEY:
Do you get it?

24:15.626 --> 24:17.525
"Little Limey bean,"
because I'm an Englishman.

24:17.663 --> 24:20.079
She calls me her
little Limey bean, you see.

24:47.486 --> 24:52.076
