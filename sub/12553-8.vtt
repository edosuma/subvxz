00:43.343 --> 00:45.111
There's got to

There's got to be.

00:46.312 --> 00:47.814
Stop! Oi!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.182
-There!
-It was a kid.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.284
Get away from me.
How did you get in here?

00:51.351 --> 00:53.586

there's only three of us left.

Gavin?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.593
What is that?

01:00.660 --> 01:02.629

02:33.820 --> 02:35.722
Clyde. There's this
big robot thing!

02:35.788 --> 02:37.924
-Yeah, I saw it,
big and yellow.
-Big and red!

02:38.124 --> 02:40.627
-(GRUNTS) Then there's two.
-I think they've got
guns in their fingers.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.161
Gavin saved me.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.897
Well, look,
the other one nearly got me...

02:46.065 --> 02:47.867
-Saved you how?
-I chucked a bin at it.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.469
That's my boy.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.104
Seeing those robots though,
relief, isn't it?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.006
Not exactly what
I was thinking, no.

02:53.072 --> 02:55.141
At least it's something
we can see,
something we can deal with.

02:55.208 --> 02:58.077
CLYDE: And how are we supposed
to deal with two big robots?

02:58.144 --> 02:59.913
CLYDE: Chuck a few more bins?
GAVIN: Have you seen this?

03:01.147 --> 03:02.549
GAVIN: What is it?

03:03.983 --> 03:05.785
RANI: You believe us now,
then?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.420
You're not scared of us?

03:07.487 --> 03:09.923
You're more normal
than these things are.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.324
Is this a language?

03:11.391 --> 03:12.792
CLYDE: No,
it's more like maths.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.161
-Equations.
-Maybe,
that is their language.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.830
They're robots, what do you
expect them to speak, Spanish?

03:17.897 --> 03:19.799
If it is a signal,
who's it for?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.869
-CLYDE: There's only us.
-Maybe, it is for us.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.672
Gavin,
you don't understand this,
do you?

03:25.738 --> 03:27.140
No, of course not.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.708
I don't know
anything about this stuff.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.744
Okay, which way did they go?

03:31.811 --> 03:33.813
Oh, uh, up there.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.282
All right, we'll follow them.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.784
Wait, what? They'll kill us.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.385
We've got to track them.

03:39.452 --> 03:40.620
If they landed nearby,
they might be going back

03:40.687 --> 03:42.155
to base, you know,
some sort of spaceship.

03:42.221 --> 03:43.656
We need to get away from them.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.326
The more we learn about them,
the more we understand,

03:46.392 --> 03:47.927
the better chance we've got.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.796
You don't have to come.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.999
-Wait back here for us.
-No.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.535
What if
you need saving again?

04:02.508 --> 04:04.844
RANI: No sign of them.
GAVIN: Oh, that suits me.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.112
Well, then we split up.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.680
What? No way.
We're staying together.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.082
Which way first?

04:09.148 --> 04:10.350
They could have gone anywhere.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.819
Hey, we need to think.
Back to HQ?

04:12.885 --> 04:13.920
Yeah.

04:19.058 --> 04:22.362
-This is HQ?
-Okay, so there are robots.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.231
Big, alien,
red and yellow robots.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.633
But do you know what?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.334
I'm sure
we're about to find out.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.436
This whole thing
now makes even less
sense than it did

04:30.503 --> 04:32.605
before there were any robots.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.907
It never made sense.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.744
Look, these robots can clear
everybody out
of the whole world,

04:37.810 --> 04:39.379
except for the three of us.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.947
The leftovers.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.882
And now they've come
looking for us!

04:42.949 --> 04:45.351
But with all
their amazing power
and technology,

04:45.418 --> 04:47.220
they can't find us?

04:47.286 --> 04:49.756
You'd think they'd have
sensors or whatever
to track us down.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.025
See, we could do it
with the stuff in the attic.
So why can't they?

04:52.091 --> 04:54.360
Attic? What attic?

04:54.427 --> 04:57.730
If Luke was here,
he'd say, "Look at the logic".

04:59.766 --> 05:00.933
Okay, so
we've travelled in time...

05:01.000 --> 05:02.301
Well, Sarah Jane
got taken though

05:02.368 --> 05:04.504
and she's done more
time travel than anyone.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.072
Time travel.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.640
Oh, right, might have guessed.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.909
Yes, except Sarah Jane
travelled through time
in a phone box.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.778
We went through
a temporal fissure.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.479
-Oh, shut up.
-It's all true.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.448
So, it's not that.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.317
Space travel, Gavin?

05:18.384 --> 05:20.386
You've travelled
in space and time?

05:20.453 --> 05:21.854
Okay, right. I believe you.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.590
-We've been in the TARDIS.
-The what-dis?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.392
It would really help,
if you spoke English.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.495
The phone box.
But again, Sarah Jane has,
Gavin hasn't.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.700
What applies to us
but not to Sarah Jane?

05:33.766 --> 05:35.535
There's nothing.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.937
Wait a minute.

05:40.773 --> 05:44.010
There is one thing,
something that only happened
to you and me.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.014
-Come on, what?
-We got grounded
by the Judoon.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.483
You keep saying these
really stupid words.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.719
If you're so clever,
why can't you just go out
and stop the robots?

05:52.785 --> 05:55.421
You and me, we were grounded,
not Sarah Jane and not Luke.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.256
Yes. That's got to be it.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.958
CLYDE: No,
they slapped a ticket on us.
We can't leave Earth.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.226
RANI: When everyone else
got taken,

06:00.293 --> 06:01.861
the robots legally
had to leave us behind?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.796
Because they didn't want
to get in trouble
with the Judoon.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.832
Yeah. Sensible robots.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.867
But you've never met
any Judoon, though.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.002
Why do you,
keep asking me this?

06:10.069 --> 06:11.637
I'm 13 years old,

06:11.704 --> 06:13.740
I go to school,
I do my homework,
I watch telly.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.175
I eat fish fingers.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.578
I'm not important
and I'm not special.

06:18.644 --> 06:19.979
I'm normal.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.150
If he's right
and the Judoon thing's right,

06:24.217 --> 06:26.285
then sticking with us
is the most dangerous thing
he could do.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.087
RANI: Because they're
after us.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.091
RANI: Out.
CLYDE: Run.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.698
It's locked.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.934
Come on. Come on.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.041
Gavin, go.
This is not your fight.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.544
-Go where?
-Just run. Get away. Hide.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.881
Go. What do we do?
What do we do?

06:54.947 --> 06:56.983
If I ever let you down,
I'm sorry.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.117
Split up. I'll lead them off.

-I know.

We can't give you the air,

What are you saying?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.302
The son and the heir.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.472
Like Prince Charles,
he's the son
and the heir of the Queen.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.474
You can definitely
have Prince Charles.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.708
Take Camilla, too,
if you want.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.343
<i>Give us prince.</i>

11:51.410 --> 11:54.280

No, you're not the prince,
but Gavin might be.

They've come to get him.

Gavin? What?

11:58.651 --> 12:00.319
Gavin's dad...

12:00.386 --> 12:02.822
He ran off. What if he ran
off back to their planet?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.523
What, you mean his mum, she...

12:04.590 --> 12:07.593
-Mmm-hmm.
-His dad was an alien king?

The only thing
that makes sense of all this.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.870
Gavin's their king.
They have come to get him.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.405
<i>He is new king.</i>

12:19.472 --> 12:20.539
<i>He will rule.</i>

12:20.606 --> 12:22.708
<i>Riches and power.</i>

12:22.775 --> 12:26.145
<i>He will give the order</i>
<i>to return human race.</i>

And the prince,
does he know he's the prince?

12:28.848 --> 12:30.282
Does he know about this?

12:30.349 --> 12:32.618
<i>Information was sent to him.</i>

12:32.685 --> 12:34.120
The energy trace last night.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.857
He never got it.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.258
He knows nothing about this.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.127
He's the only one that
can bring everyone back.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.563
We sent him away.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.031
What have we done?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.801
Gavin's place. Come on.

13:13.692 --> 13:14.727
CLYDE: Gavin?

13:15.761 --> 13:17.596
-Gavin.
-Where is he?

13:17.663 --> 13:18.964
We've got to go back down.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.399
Tell the robots
we need more time.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.868
No, they don't care about us,
our planet, anybody.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.637
I don't think they're evil,
they're just thick.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.405
How do you mean?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.508
It's like if Prince Harry got
captured abroad somewhere,

13:29.575 --> 13:31.477
the government would send
the army in to go get him.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.646
They wouldn't care
who got hurt.

13:33.712 --> 13:37.016
See, they're royal robots,
protocol and all that.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.585
The mission's gone wrong,
but they don't know
how to adapt.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.387
So, they're programmed
to bring everyone back,

13:41.453 --> 13:43.389
-but only when
they've got Gavin?
-Yes.

13:43.455 --> 13:47.359
And that warp shunt thing's
only good
for another 15 minutes.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.094
-We've got to find him.
-15 minutes.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.563
Where do we start?

13:50.629 --> 13:51.997
Where would he go?

13:52.064 --> 13:53.499
I mean, where would you go
if it was you?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.001
Somewhere I felt safe.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.303
Home.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.939
I don't think
he feels safe here.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.141
Like I said, this place...

14:02.208 --> 14:03.809
It's their home,
his aunt and uncle's.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.011
So where's he gone?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.686
Look. Gavin's mum, must be.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.854
And maybe that's his dad,
the old king.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.357
-Gavin's diary.
-You can't read that.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.093
We've got to.
It's the end of the world
and all that.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.861
Nothing, nothing...

14:22.928 --> 14:25.831
Ooh, bad poems. Bad poems!

14:25.898 --> 14:27.299
CLYDE: Wait, what's this?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.834
"Went to the circle",
and again here, "the circle".

14:28.901 --> 14:30.703
-What's the circle?
-The Circle.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.671
Nature reserve place,
we went there
on a school trip. Remember?

14:32.738 --> 14:34.273
The most boring day
of my life, yeah.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.942
Nature, animals.
He's in to all that stuff.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.911
RANI: He's five minutes away.
We can make it, come on.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.649
Follow us. Quickly.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.763
He's here. Gavin?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.000
Look, split up. Go that way.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.740
CLYDE: Gavin.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.575
There he is. Gavin!

15:12.611 --> 15:14.513
What've you done?
Why are they here?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.882
-You told me to get away.
-Gavin, we were wrong.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.617
We were wrong
and you were wrong.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.386
It turns out you're really
important after all.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.821
In fact, you're the most
important person
on this planet.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.424
-You just didn't know it.
-Rani, three minutes.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.359
-You've got to listen.
-Get off me.
I told you, I'm nothing.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.229
<i>-Where is the son and heir?</i>
-Right there.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.264
They're after me?
And you're helping them?

15:32.331 --> 15:33.799
<i>There is nobody there.</i>

15:33.866 --> 15:35.601
Are you blind?
He's right there.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.303
We've got two minutes 45.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.004
You've got to listen to me.
Your dad,

15:39.071 --> 15:41.774
he was an alien,
an alien king. And they...

15:41.840 --> 15:44.176
They want you,
to be their new king.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.477
I never even knew my dad.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.414
Think. Tell us everything
you know about your dad.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.182
I don't know anything.
I keep telling you this.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.551
My mum didn't like
talking about him.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.253
She said
maybe when I was older.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.055
She died
before she could tell you.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.257
<i>Where is the son and heir?</i>

15:58.324 --> 16:00.392
Think.
Right, they can't see you.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.828
Something is stopping them
from seeing you.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.496
Something to do with your dad.

16:04.563 --> 16:05.631
Two minutes 15.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.036
Hold on. My mum gave me this.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.405
She said
my dad gave it to her.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.640
To protect me.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.974
RANI: That must be it.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.476
To shield what you are,

16:17.543 --> 16:20.713
your alien half,
to give you a normal life.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.349
Please, Gavin, listen to us,
trust us.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.483
Just take off that ring.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.753
What are they going
to do to me?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.689
Gavin, please.
You can save everyone,
just take off the ring.

16:46.905 --> 16:47.840
(BEEPING)

16:53.846 --> 16:55.147
<i>The son and heir.</i>

16:57.349 --> 16:59.418
<i>Bio-damper shielded him.</i>

16:59.485 --> 17:02.154
That's why he didn't get
the message last night.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.689
Look, send it again.
Tell him who he is.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.502
Come on.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.049
It's true.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.253
-It's all true.
-Yep.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.789
Rani, they want me.
They need me.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.324
No one ever wanted me before.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.360
I am the most
important person
on the planet.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.395
-Well, it's just
the three of us...
-Shh!

17:43.462 --> 17:45.364
And on that planet, too.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.633
My home. My real home.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.301
It's got to be
your choice to go.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.805
I've made my choice.
Why would I stay here?

17:52.871 --> 17:54.506
There's a whole new
world waiting for me,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.643
halfway across the universe.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.978
My planet. So beautiful, so...

18:00.045 --> 18:02.114
-Peaceful.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.149
We've got one minute 15,
Your Highness.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.018
So, if you could just make the
order and bring everyone back?

18:09.922 --> 18:10.889
Your king commands you.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.193
<i>Our king commands us.</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:16.462
Take me home and bring
the humans back to Earth.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.965
Clyde, Rani, thank you.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.601
Earth was never my home,
not really.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.269
But, it is your home

18:24.336 --> 18:26.338
and you're lucky to have
people that love you here.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.140
Before I go,

18:28.207 --> 18:30.909
I now name you, Lord Clyde,
and you, Lady Rani.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.417
We've been gonged.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.552
Lady Rani?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.454
Yeah, that'll do.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.058
35 seconds, come on.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.296
RANI: Come on, come on,
bring them back.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.866
We've only got
10 seconds.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.202
It was all for nothing.
We were too late.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.005
-What if the power failed?
-Come on. Please.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.507
-Clyde, get out of the road!
-(CAR HORN BLARES)

19:02.708 --> 19:03.542
(STOP CLOCK BEEPS)

19:04.376 --> 19:05.978
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

19:08.647 --> 19:10.582
-Yes.
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:10.649 --> 19:12.017
You know, for a minute there,

19:12.084 --> 19:14.253
I thought it was just
going to be me and you.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.554
Forever.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.823
Yeah. Relief.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.857
(RANI LAUGHS)

19:26.365 --> 19:27.866
Gita, calm down.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.202
Give it 10 more minutes,
then we'll call the police.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.837
Yes, I know.

19:31.904 --> 19:32.871
Hold on...

19:34.940 --> 19:37.843
It's her. Calm down, Gita.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.711
See you
when you're back here.
Where've you been?

19:39.778 --> 19:42.180
Oh, Dad. Yes!

19:42.247 --> 19:44.783
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.119
Look at you, my dad.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.921
You weren't in your bed,

19:49.121 --> 19:51.123
Sarah Jane hasn't heard
from you, your mum's gone
out searching...

19:51.189 --> 19:52.925
I'm really sorry.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.427
Are you sure
everything's okay?

19:55.494 --> 19:58.764
Er, yeah. Why?

19:58.830 --> 20:00.065
Is everything okay with you?

20:01.266 --> 20:03.835
Yes. No. Rani...

20:03.902 --> 20:07.205
An hour and a half, it just...
Jumped.

20:07.272 --> 20:10.676
It was 7:00.
Then suddenly, it's 8:30.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.377
Really?

20:12.444 --> 20:14.613
No. Go on,
you're winding me up.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.981
It was on the news.
We saw it.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.685
Then we couldn't find you.

20:19.751 --> 20:24.222
Wait, hang on.
You thought this was
something to do with me?

20:24.289 --> 20:26.658
We didn't know what
to think any more.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.362
Rani, so many strange
things have happened since
we've moved here.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.863
Tell me where you were,
who you were with?

20:37.603 --> 20:40.038
I was at...

20:40.105 --> 20:42.574
Honestly, come on,
I'm your dad.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.344
-We don't have secrets.
-Okay.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.879
Well, I, erm...

20:49.548 --> 20:51.183
I was with Clyde.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.385
-Oh, there's a surprise.
-Yes, Mum, I'm fine,
all right?

20:53.452 --> 20:55.721
Everything's okay.
I'll explain
everything later, I promise.

20:56.989 --> 20:57.889
All right, bye.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.058
Somehow.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.428
Hello, sir.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.298
Only a sir, eh?

21:06.365 --> 21:07.866
You know, some people,

21:09.368 --> 21:11.103
are lords.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.404
And what's that
supposed to mean?

21:14.406 --> 21:16.642
SARAH JANE: No, it's okay,
Luke, I think they're here.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.879
I'll call you later.
Oh, Clyde.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.484
SARAH JANE: Rani.
CHANDRA: Right,
where were you?

21:27.853 --> 21:30.188
I was helping Lord Clyde
with his homework.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.758
He's got
<i>Great Expectations,</i> too.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.594
There was no signal.
The network must
have gone down.

21:35.661 --> 21:37.896
-Lord Clyde?
-Tell you later.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.502
You scared the life
out of me, Rani.

21:43.568 --> 21:46.805
Oh, there we are, then.
Panic over.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.474
I knew there'd be a perfectly
normal explanation.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.442
There always is, isn't there?

21:51.843 --> 21:55.814
For an hour and a half
to have gone missing?

21:55.881 --> 21:58.884
I swear, there's something
odd about this road.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.487
-Sarah Jane?
-Mmm, yes?

22:04.289 --> 22:05.991
Sorry to have put you out.

22:06.058 --> 22:10.429
Oh, no problem. As long as
everyone's safe and sound.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.864
Yes, Clyde can tell me
all about it.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.232
-Bye, Haresh.
-Bye.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.067
See you.

22:20.605 --> 22:23.475
Well, um, I'd better go get
ready for school.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.910
Love you.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.046
Still don't know what you
see in that Langer boy.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.523
SARAH JANE: Mr Smith's fixed
the official records.
Gavin's moved to Australia.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.659
I reckon the aunt
and uncle will be glad
to see the back of him.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.828
Yeah, he was happy
getting away from them.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.864
You two were brilliant.
Worked it
out all by yourselves.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.468
Only because you showed
us how to.
You like, trained us.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.205
Yeah, you're the commander,
we're just the space cadets.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.240
Yeah, well,
I'm not sure I like that.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.675
(RANI LAUGHS)

22:56.742 --> 22:58.877
If we'd never met you,
we would have been stuffed.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.579
If you'd never met me,
got grounded by the Judoon,

23:00.645 --> 23:03.482
you wouldn't have been
in danger in the first place.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.318
Sarah Jane, you're
like the best thing that
ever happened to us.

23:06.384 --> 23:09.488
Yeah. When I was a kid,
I thought I'd never
do anything.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.556
End up nowhere, just

23:11.623 --> 23:13.225
dossing about.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.860
I never saw all
of this coming.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.595
One day, if it all stops,

23:16.661 --> 23:19.264
I don't want you,
ending up alone,
like I used to be.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.433
Hey, after today I can
tell you straight,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.535
you've got no idea
what it's like being alone.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.773
Fair point. Right.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.708
I'm getting pizza menus.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.877
Reward for saving
the human race.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.011
On me.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.415
We're not alone though,
are we?

23:39.050 --> 23:39.951
No.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.688
We've got each other.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.861
Not a bad morning's work,
My Lord.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.933
Indeed, My Ladyship.
Score one up for
the hangers-on.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.735
(LAUGHS)

24:03.241 --> 24:05.610
THE SHOPKEEPER:
<i>The tapestry of time</i>
<i>is a fragile thing.</i>

24:07.412 --> 24:10.549
But you understand that,
don't you, Sarah Jane?

24:10.615 --> 24:13.351
-How do you know my name?
-Oh, I know a great
many things.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.153
SARAH JANE: Who are you,
and what do you want?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.455
I need your help
to save the world.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.658
This is a time window,
Sarah Jane.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.393
Then how do we get back?

24:21.459 --> 24:22.928
There is no choice
in the matter.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.500
You have until the
sands run out,

24:28.567 --> 24:29.868
or this world is doomed.

24:31.536 --> 24:34.072
So, this is like 1939
or something?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.475
7th of June, 1941.
Now keep your voice down.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.511
-Why, what are you
looking at?
-Germans.

24:40.579 --> 24:41.813
Nazis?

24:41.880 --> 24:44.282
Is this Buckingham Palace?

24:44.349 --> 24:45.550
It is the Tower of London.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.720
At last, I have you trapped.

24:48.787 --> 24:51.356
We had best find more
suitable attire

24:51.423 --> 24:52.991
for the Queen's
new lady-in-waiting.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.262
-What year is this?
-1889.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.164
(VOICES ECHO)

24:59.231 --> 25:01.066
No such thing as ghosts,
you say?

25:01.533 --> 25:03.602
Ta-da.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.504
We cannot keep the time window
open much longer.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.174
It's dead.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.776
8:00. That's it.
That's when
they say it starts.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.579
If Sarah Jane and her friends
do not return soon,

25:14.646 --> 25:15.881
they'll be trapped
in the past.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.483
Forever.
