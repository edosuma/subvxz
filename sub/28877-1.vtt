00:52.617 --> 00:53.448
Are you Viveca?

00:53.450 --> 00:54.614
Yes, hi.

00:54.616 --> 00:55.618
Hi, I'm Frankie.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.470
Mr. Cosmo's waiting inside, let's go.

01:03.967 --> 01:04.798
Hi, Viveca.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.808
Hello, Mr. Cosmo.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.753
Meet Aglas, my head bodyguard.

01:08.780 --> 01:09.611
Hello.

01:09.613 --> 01:10.818
Hi.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.378
Mr. Duncan, he's sick.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.558
He asked me to deliver
this briefcase to you.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.393
Here.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.698
Where are we going?

01:23.700 --> 01:26.628
I only came to deliver the briefcase.

01:26.630 --> 01:27.748
Viveca, relax.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.928
I only wanna ask you a few
things while we drive around.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.628
You see, I don't like being at one place

01:31.630 --> 01:32.828
for too long.

01:32.830 --> 01:34.978
What do you want to know?

01:34.980 --> 01:37.375
I have to go back to work soon.

01:37.377 --> 01:38.208
Viveca, tell me.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.198
Do you know what's inside the briefcase?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.505
I have no idea and I don't want to know.

01:43.507 --> 01:44.758
And why not?

01:44.760 --> 01:46.983
Because I like to mind my own business.

01:48.701 --> 01:50.968
You're a very smart young lady.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.788
Now tell me, do you know
what all this is about?

01:53.790 --> 01:56.158
I don't understand the question.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.005
Okay, let me rephrase that.

01:59.007 --> 02:00.148
Do you fully understand the nature

02:00.150 --> 02:03.305
of our relationship with
your boss, Mr. Duncan?

02:03.307 --> 02:04.988
No I don't.

02:04.990 --> 02:07.529
I'm just doing my boss a favor.

02:07.531 --> 02:09.326
And you don't care to know why your boss

02:09.328 --> 02:11.103
wants this briefcase delivered to me?

02:11.105 --> 02:13.132
Why should I care?

02:13.134 --> 02:15.658
You're not the slightest bit curious?

02:15.660 --> 02:18.778
No, because not minding your business

02:18.780 --> 02:21.068
can cost you your life.

02:21.070 --> 02:22.738
Are you accusing us of something?

02:22.740 --> 02:23.988
Not at all.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.473
I made a general statement.

02:27.033 --> 02:29.353
Viveca, are we good guys or bad guys?

02:30.713 --> 02:32.888
I don't know anything about you

02:32.890 --> 02:35.288
so I can't answer that.

02:35.290 --> 02:37.147
Congratulations, Viveca.

02:37.149 --> 02:38.066
For what?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.418
For not disappointing me.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.738
A bullet in the head would
have been your punishment.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.452
So we'll take you back now.

02:44.454 --> 02:46.518
Give Rafer Duncan my regards.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.353
I will.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.028
Did you hear what I just said?

02:55.030 --> 02:56.758
I swear I'll cut your balls off

02:56.760 --> 02:58.458
if you don't deliver in the next hour.

02:58.460 --> 02:59.948
I'm not Cosmo.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.118
I'm Jasper Murrant.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.108
And I'll kill you in a heartbeat.

03:04.110 --> 03:06.068
And that little two year old of yours,

03:06.070 --> 03:07.628
I'll kill her too.

03:07.630 --> 03:08.841
And her mother.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.913
Now get off the phone.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.368
Hello, Jasper.

03:14.370 --> 03:17.858
Call me Mr. Murrant.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.945
Call me Miss Fouquier.

03:19.947 --> 03:21.814
You don't fear me.

03:21.816 --> 03:23.507
I fear only God.

03:25.243 --> 03:27.341
You wanna be a gangster?

03:27.343 --> 03:29.958
No, I'm simply making the best

03:29.960 --> 03:33.488
of an unfortunate situation.

03:33.490 --> 03:36.188
Rafer Duncan is putting you in danger.

03:36.190 --> 03:38.758
We're always in danger.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.381
Even in our sleep, we may never wake up.

03:42.383 --> 03:43.383
Give me the money.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.098
Are you the new boss?

03:47.100 --> 03:49.538
Cosmo's out of the country on business.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.218
I'm in charge of it now.

03:51.220 --> 03:52.648
Goodbye.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.481
One more question.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.368
No more questions.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.358
And tell your boss to stop sending you

03:57.360 --> 03:59.098
on these errands.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.694
You're too smart for your own good.

04:01.696 --> 04:04.348
At least we have something in common.

04:04.350 --> 04:05.738
I swear I'll cut your tongue out

04:05.740 --> 04:07.698
if you say one more word.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.253
My boss wouldn't like that.

04:10.796 --> 04:13.088
You know what, come work for me.

04:13.090 --> 04:14.078
No.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.598
I'm not a criminal.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.128
I'm only a victim of circumstance.

04:18.130 --> 04:19.748
Goodbye, Jasper.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.608
Be careful, Viveca.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.443
Bye.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.568
Mr. Duncan, it's time
for another glass of water.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.718
You're trying to drown me.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.408
You don't drink enough water.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.428
That's probably why you are sick.

04:42.430 --> 04:44.558
I'm sick because I
don't get enough sleep.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.408
And why is that?

04:46.410 --> 04:48.168
Drink the water first.

04:48.170 --> 04:50.788
You sound like my mother.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.568
Drink, or else.

04:52.570 --> 04:53.528
You have to.

04:53.530 --> 04:55.409
I'm not giving you a choice

04:55.411 --> 04:57.258
because it's good for you.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.938
That's why I trust you.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.598
You care so much.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.588
I see how you treat others.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.368
It must take so much energy emotionally.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.778
It just happens.

05:06.780 --> 05:09.368
I think some people are born that way.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.253
Drink up.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.868
I'm gonna tell you something
I never told anybody.

05:17.870 --> 05:19.088
Sit down.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.208
Okay, Mr. Duncan.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.768
Still having a migraine?

05:21.770 --> 05:25.897
Yes, but sit down before
I decide not to tell you.

05:27.430 --> 05:28.813
What do you have to say?

05:29.970 --> 05:34.768
Viveca, I wish you were
the daughter I never had.

05:34.770 --> 05:39.578
Mr. Duncan, sometimes, I
think of you as my father,

05:39.580 --> 05:44.580
my uncle, my big brother and
my grandfather all in one.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.058
Gee, don't turn me into a holy ghost.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.203
Give me your hand.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.678
You'll crush my
bones squeezing that hard.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.228
I squeeze so hard because our actions

05:57.230 --> 05:59.478
speak louder than our words.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.294
It's loud and clear.

06:01.296 --> 06:03.343
Much love.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.154
Thanks, Viveca.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.438
You're welcome.

06:06.440 --> 06:10.088
Now I can tell you something
that I've been dying

06:10.090 --> 06:11.438
to say to you.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.668
What, may I ask?

06:13.670 --> 06:16.163
Please, I want you to stop.

06:18.743 --> 06:19.574
Stop what?

06:19.576 --> 06:21.788
The bad things that are going on.

06:21.790 --> 06:24.548
The way I see it, either the police

06:24.550 --> 06:27.608
catches up with you,
or Cosmo and his people

06:27.610 --> 06:31.608
might decide to kill you just
for one reason or another.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.568
How much do you know?

06:33.570 --> 06:36.808
You know I'm not stupid, Mr. Duncan.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.613
I don't know everything but I know enough.

06:41.523 --> 06:44.074
I'm now talking to you like your daughter.

06:44.076 --> 06:47.038
Not as your trusted caring employee.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.821
I feel for you.

06:48.823 --> 06:50.240
You need to stop.

06:51.087 --> 06:52.023
You are rich.

06:52.903 --> 06:53.981
You don't need the money.

06:53.983 --> 06:56.058
This isn't about me, Viveca.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.478
This is about a little
boy who's brutally damaged

06:59.480 --> 07:04.048
by society many years
ago who said to himself,

07:04.050 --> 07:06.803
revenge is a promise.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.901
I don't understand.

07:09.903 --> 07:14.903
My mother died in childbirth
when I was only nine,

07:15.040 --> 07:20.021
leaving me and my father with a family

07:20.023 --> 07:22.818
that didn't wanna be
bothered with either of us.

07:22.820 --> 07:25.128
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.584
It's life, it's tough.

07:27.586 --> 07:31.858
But my father did a great
job taking care of me.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.303
He was a great guy.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.593
He worked hard, never got into trouble.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.528
And then one night, there
was a knock on the door.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.118
It was the police.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.818
They arrested my father for murder,

07:45.820 --> 07:48.738
a crime he did not commit.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.648
Really?

07:49.650 --> 07:51.013
Yeah, really.

07:52.304 --> 07:55.236
He was sentenced to life in prison.

07:55.238 --> 07:58.538
I was sent out to live with strangers

07:58.540 --> 08:01.148
when I was 11 years old.

08:01.150 --> 08:06.018
Dysfunctional foster parents
who gamed the system,

08:06.020 --> 08:09.744
beat the daylights out of
me and got away with it.

08:09.746 --> 08:11.140
That's really terrible.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.848
It got worse.

08:12.850 --> 08:17.850
After 22 years in prison, my
father gained his freedom.

08:18.506 --> 08:21.049
You know how?

08:21.051 --> 08:23.288
No.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.394
During a prison riot.

08:25.396 --> 08:26.468
He was stabbed in both eyes.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.018
Oh my god!

08:28.020 --> 08:31.258
He became blinded in both eyes.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.097
He was lucky to be alive.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.678
He spent six months in the hospital.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.857
That's so heartbreaking.

08:37.860 --> 08:41.207
Well two days before he was
scheduled to go back to jail

08:41.210 --> 08:42.222
from the hospital,

08:43.652 --> 08:47.818
he went to sleep after
he took his medication.

08:47.820 --> 08:51.678
When he woke up, both
of his legs were gone.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.118
What?

08:53.120 --> 08:54.514
Amputated!

08:54.516 --> 08:58.168
It was a mixup, doctors
operated on the wrong patient.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.038
They cut off my father's
legs instead of the patient

09:01.040 --> 09:03.061
with whom he was sharing the room with.

09:03.063 --> 09:04.653
That is so wrong.

09:07.572 --> 09:08.655
It happens.

09:09.510 --> 09:12.298
Well, the story made headlines.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.058
A couple weeks later, the criminal

09:15.060 --> 09:18.648
who committed the crime
came forward and confessed.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.208
He did?

09:20.210 --> 09:21.778
Yeah.

09:21.780 --> 09:26.563
My father was finally
set free after 22 years.

09:29.435 --> 09:32.385
The hospital paid him five
million after they were sued

09:32.387 --> 09:35.368
and the state gave him two million dollars

09:35.370 --> 09:39.308
for putting the wrong
man in jail for 22 years.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.228
But nobody, nobody told me or him

09:42.230 --> 09:43.280
that they were sorry.

09:44.530 --> 09:49.273
Innocent man was sent
to jail for 22 years.

09:50.544 --> 09:53.401
He was stabbed in both eyes and blinded.

09:53.403 --> 09:54.236
He was crippled.

09:55.670 --> 09:57.153
Nobody said they were sorry.

09:58.578 --> 10:03.208
I am so sorry, I don't
know what to say, Mr. Duncan.

10:03.210 --> 10:06.553
All they did was throw money at us.

10:09.846 --> 10:13.027
My father couldn't deal with it all.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.315
So one morning, he found my gun,

10:20.822 --> 10:22.072
killed himself.

10:23.398 --> 10:24.533
That's so heartbreaking.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.763
Well on that day, I decided
I will never have a family.

10:31.770 --> 10:35.438
I wasn't going to bring
a child into this world

10:35.440 --> 10:36.987
to suffer like I did.

10:38.348 --> 10:39.883
I am so sorry.

10:39.885 --> 10:41.528
I don't know what to say, Mr. Duncan.

10:41.530 --> 10:43.422
I'm sorry I made you,

10:43.424 --> 10:45.618
You didn't make me do anything
that I didn't want to do.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.308
I'm not making excuses.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.208
I just wanted you to
know that I've carried

10:49.210 --> 10:51.568
a deep grudge all of my life.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.798
When the opportunity presented itself

10:53.800 --> 10:56.888
I was already predisposed
to hurting other people.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.288
I guess in a way I'm exacting revenge

10:59.290 --> 11:02.031
against the society and system

11:02.033 --> 11:05.023
that failed both me and my father.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.338
Does that make sense to you?

11:09.340 --> 11:12.298
You should have gotten
therapy, Mr. Duncan.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.158
Now it's too late.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.028
And as I said, I have a
feeling this isn't going

11:18.030 --> 11:20.368
to end very well for you.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.198
And maybe for me too.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.648
I will never hurt you, Viveca.

11:24.650 --> 11:27.543
Promise you will never betray me.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.926
Mr. Duncan, I can't explain why

11:32.928 --> 11:35.638
but I'm not afraid to die.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.073
You need your rest.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.222
Are you thirsty?

11:40.224 --> 11:43.548
You're more than I
bargained for, young lady.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.648
Some people are predictable.

11:45.650 --> 11:48.928
I am not one of them, Mr. Duncan.

11:48.930 --> 11:49.763
Good night.

12:00.989 --> 12:05.504
Promise
you will never betray me.

12:05.506 --> 12:08.222
Mr. Duncan, I can't explain why

12:08.224 --> 12:10.391
but I'm not afraid to die.

12:28.826 --> 12:30.980
I have a feeling this isn't going to end

12:30.982 --> 12:33.707
very well for you, and maybe for me too.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.739
Meznick insurance corporation,

12:46.741 --> 12:48.116
Jennifer Strand speaking, hi.

12:48.118 --> 12:49.968
Hello Miss Strand.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.218
My name is Viveca Fouquier.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.968
Please, I have to speak with
your Chief Claims Officer.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.518
May I ask
what this is in regards to?

12:58.520 --> 13:02.268
I know some big secrets
that are causing your company

13:02.270 --> 13:05.148
millions of dollars.

13:05.150 --> 13:08.068
Miss, can you
please be more specific?

13:08.070 --> 13:10.708
Yes, I know for certain some people

13:10.710 --> 13:14.158
have been murdered for
life insurance money.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.538
And your company has been paying out

13:16.540 --> 13:19.398
millions of dollars to the murderers.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.368
You're kidding.

13:20.370 --> 13:21.888
Who are these people?

13:21.890 --> 13:24.228
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.

13:24.230 --> 13:27.478
I need to discuss it with
your Chief Claims Officer.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.109
May I speak to him?

13:29.111 --> 13:31.308
Certainly, you may.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.828
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to put you on hold

13:32.830 --> 13:34.188
for just a minute or so.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.260
Please don't go away.

13:36.140 --> 13:36.973
Thank you.

13:57.415 --> 13:59.063
Hello?

13:59.065 --> 14:00.631
Hello?

14:00.633 --> 14:02.453
Miss Viveca, I believe.

14:02.455 --> 14:04.428
Viveca Fouquier.

14:04.430 --> 14:06.308
Hi, I'm Christopher Lombard.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.898
The Chief Claims Officer
here at Meznick Insurance.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.937
I heard you have some very
disturbing piece of information

14:11.939 --> 14:14.458
to share with us.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.068
Yes, may I ask what you do

14:16.070 --> 14:18.368
as the Chief Claims Officer?

14:18.370 --> 14:21.738
Miss Fouquier, my job
here mainly involves

14:21.740 --> 14:23.998
the processing of high claims.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.128
That's a million dollars or more.

14:26.130 --> 14:29.098
I directly supervise a
team of investigators

14:29.100 --> 14:31.185
to uncover any fraudulent claims

14:31.187 --> 14:33.908
and identify legitimate ones.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.958
Then I make recommendations to the CEO

14:35.960 --> 14:38.378
to deny or approve the settlement.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.978
Good, you're the
person I want to talk to.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.118
And you have my undivided attention.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.335
Would you like to come in and
discuss this in my office?

14:47.337 --> 14:50.111
I'm sorry Mr. Lombard, I can't.

14:50.113 --> 14:53.248
You sound distrustful, Viveca.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.388
May I call you Viveca?

14:55.390 --> 14:57.268
Yes, you may.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.328
Call me Chris.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.298
You have a beautiful accent.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.978
Where are you from?

15:01.980 --> 15:03.908
My father is a Nigerian.

15:03.910 --> 15:07.248
My mother is South African from Cape Town.

15:07.250 --> 15:11.508
And I was born and raised in
Cap-Haïtien where they met.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.818
Where is that?

15:12.820 --> 15:14.688
West Indies.

15:14.690 --> 15:19.058
Cap-Haïtien is a city in
the northern part of Haiti.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.298
Got it.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.060
How long have you lived
in the United States?

15:23.062 --> 15:24.818
About six years.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.748
You should come out and meet me

15:26.750 --> 15:29.368
and I'll tell you everything that I know.

15:29.370 --> 15:30.758
Viveca, give me your location

15:30.760 --> 15:32.548
and I'll be right there.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.508
Are you in any imminent danger?

15:34.510 --> 15:36.598
I have no way of knowing.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.333
Have you reported
anything to the police?

15:39.335 --> 15:41.485
No, I haven't.

15:41.487 --> 15:43.798
May I ask why you have not?

15:43.800 --> 15:46.148
It's because I don't have my papers.

15:46.150 --> 15:48.388
I'm living in this country illegally

15:48.390 --> 15:49.968
but not by choice.

15:49.970 --> 15:52.728
I am a victim of human trafficking

15:52.730 --> 15:55.288
and I'm hoping that your
company will help me

15:55.290 --> 15:59.411
in return for helping you
save millions of dollars

15:59.413 --> 16:01.538
and more innocent lives
waiting to be taken.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.573
We'll certainly do whatever we can.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.138
I have one more question
before I run out of my office

16:07.140 --> 16:08.468
to meet with you.

16:08.470 --> 16:09.303
What?

16:10.247 --> 16:14.247
Have you talked to the press?

16:14.249 --> 16:17.228
Have you talked to any
journalist, newspaper,

16:17.230 --> 16:19.788
radio or TV station?

16:19.790 --> 16:23.278
Have you talked to anyone on
the internet regarding this?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.223
That's more than one question.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.498
I'll answer when I see you.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.808
You have 20 minutes to find me

16:29.810 --> 16:32.118
or you will never see me again.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.488
I'm waiting in Fort Lauderdale park

16:34.490 --> 16:36.177
in the parking lot.

16:36.179 --> 16:37.648
That's only a few
minutes from your office.

16:37.650 --> 16:38.713
Okay, on my way.

16:39.673 --> 16:43.008
But before I hang up, listen, please.

16:43.010 --> 16:45.948
I need you to answer just
that one question for me.

16:45.950 --> 16:50.950
You see, bad publicity can
hurt our company's image.

16:50.985 --> 16:53.895
And harm us in the stock markets.

16:53.897 --> 16:56.008
You have nothing to worry about.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.265
I have not spoken to anyone.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.198
And right now I'm beginning
to have second thoughts

17:01.200 --> 17:02.548
about talking to you.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.048
Maybe I'm better off
talking to the police.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.218
What's the worst that can happen?

17:07.220 --> 17:09.208
They'll get immigration to send me back

17:09.210 --> 17:11.009
where I came from.

17:11.011 --> 17:12.628
But that isn't what you want

17:12.631 --> 17:15.825
or you wouldn't be
talking to me right now.

17:15.827 --> 17:20.518
Listen, Viveca, I'll bring you a gift.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.637
As an immediate incentive
so as not to talk

17:23.640 --> 17:25.098
to anyone else.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.377
I'll bring you 10,000
dollars cash right away.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.709
How does that sound?

17:29.711 --> 17:30.542
What?

17:30.544 --> 17:32.078
Sorry, I meant 50,000.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.518
50,000 dollars for what?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.618
Not to go to the police?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.445
For your cooperation in this matter.

17:39.447 --> 17:43.111
Please, do not get the police involved.

17:43.113 --> 17:45.398
Do not talk to anyone.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.378
Wait right there for me.

17:47.380 --> 17:51.058
And in less than 20 minutes,
you'll have 50,000 dollars

17:51.060 --> 17:52.661
and our gratitude.

17:52.663 --> 17:56.428
Viveca, do we have a deal?

17:56.430 --> 17:58.008
Wait.

17:58.010 --> 17:58.893
I'm thinking.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.698
Make it one million dollars.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.258
Excuse me?

18:05.260 --> 18:08.203
I want protection, not money.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.873
We'll protect you, Viveca.

18:12.711 --> 18:14.143
I'm on my way.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.747
Okay, see you.

18:52.059 --> 18:53.208
Hello?

18:53.210 --> 18:54.728
Rafer.

18:54.730 --> 18:55.898
It's me.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.100
We've got a big problem.

18:57.943 --> 19:01.028
Your assistant Viveca
has just betrayed us.

19:01.030 --> 19:02.878
No she didn't.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.508
She would never.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.088
She just called our office and began

19:07.090 --> 19:08.090
blowing her whistle.

19:09.010 --> 19:11.308
I'm on my way to stabilize the situation.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.138
Just wanted to give you a head up.

19:13.140 --> 19:14.340
Please don't hurt her.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.778
She's a good girl, she's all I got.

19:18.780 --> 19:22.708
Rafer, you'll spend the
rest of your life in jail

19:22.710 --> 19:25.208
if I don't do this.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.398
And so will everybody else on my team.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.208
Please let me handle it, Chris.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.930
Sorry, I can't.

19:30.932 --> 19:31.803
We can't.

19:32.977 --> 19:34.828
I've got to go now.

19:34.830 --> 19:35.988
We're running out of time.

19:35.990 --> 19:36.963
Wait, Chris.

19:37.958 --> 19:41.563
I'll give you 10 million
dollars to save her life.

19:42.670 --> 19:45.858
I haven't spent any of my share.

19:45.860 --> 19:49.948
In fact, I'll give you
all of it to spare her.

19:49.950 --> 19:52.478
You don't get it, Rafer Duncan.

19:52.480 --> 19:56.133
My freedom is on the line
and that of the entire team.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.718
Obviously, you don't
care about yours anymore.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.370
Well let me tell you right now.

20:03.346 --> 20:08.048
If you kill Viveca, I'm gonna
turn myself into the FBI

20:08.050 --> 20:10.293
and blow this racket wide open.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.488
You got that?

20:12.490 --> 20:14.733
You're bluffing, Rafer, you're bluffing.

20:15.606 --> 20:18.178
The feds will never let you cut a deal

20:18.180 --> 20:21.288
once they find out you've
committed five murders already.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.584
You'll rot in jail.

20:23.586 --> 20:25.343
I'll take my chances.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.538
I know you don't mean that.

20:28.540 --> 20:32.240
Let me go take care of
this for all our sakes

20:32.242 --> 20:33.568
before it's too late.

20:33.570 --> 20:35.152
Gotta go now.

20:52.437 --> 20:53.818
Hello, Mr. Duncan.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.438
I saw your name on my call ID as usual.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.718
Nothing usual about this call.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.088
You betrayed me, Viveca.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.048
You called the insurance company.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.208
I'm so disappointed in you.

21:03.210 --> 21:06.028
You promised that you
would never betray me.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.308
No, I never promised you that.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.278
You wanted a promise but
I never gave that promise.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.478
Because I'm tired of
dealing with criminals

21:13.480 --> 21:14.768
on your behalf.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.395
I begged you to stop.

21:16.397 --> 21:18.818
You told me a very sad story

21:18.820 --> 21:22.748
and I felt so sorry for you,
for that little boy in you.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.118
But at the end, you still did not tell me

21:25.120 --> 21:27.808
what I wanted so desperately to hear.

21:27.810 --> 21:30.108
That you will stop doing these bad things.

21:30.110 --> 21:31.528
I'm sorry, Mr. Duncan.

21:31.530 --> 21:33.848
I can no longer be a part of that.

21:33.850 --> 21:35.528
I want a better life.

21:35.530 --> 21:38.798
Find a good man, get married, have kids,

21:38.800 --> 21:41.033
live a normal life like so many people.

21:42.890 --> 21:43.773
Well Viveca.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.545
Because I love you like
the daughter I never had,

21:47.547 --> 21:50.008
I must inform you that sadly,
none of the good things

21:50.010 --> 21:52.868
that you wish for are ever going to happen

21:52.870 --> 21:55.223
because you made the wrong move.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.588
And as a result, you've
now become a major threat

21:59.590 --> 22:01.788
to the freedom of a group of people

22:01.790 --> 22:05.388
who are quite resourceful
and will stop at nothing

22:05.390 --> 22:06.603
to destroy you.

22:07.448 --> 22:10.328
Viveca, I apologize
that I couldn't tell you

22:10.330 --> 22:11.663
what you wanted to hear.

22:12.610 --> 22:15.993
The damage that was
done to me was complete.

22:15.995 --> 22:16.826
There's something inside me,

22:16.828 --> 22:19.138
that angry little boy inside me

22:19.140 --> 22:21.943
would not let me do the right thing.

22:23.110 --> 22:27.568
It's a very powerful demon
that I can't seem to overcome.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.928
Sometimes it feels like
an angel and a demon

22:30.930 --> 22:33.118
are both living inside of me.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.978
And on very rare occasions
the angel is able

22:35.980 --> 22:37.548
to subdue the demon.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.763
But more often than not, the
demon clobbers the angel.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.263
Are you still there, Viveca?

22:44.265 --> 22:45.818
Yes I am.

22:45.820 --> 22:48.468
I heard everything that you said.

22:48.470 --> 22:51.878
It is quite unfortunate
that it has to end like this.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.207
I tried to save you Viveca,

22:55.127 --> 22:57.383
but it's an impossible situation.

23:01.796 --> 23:04.448
Hopefully it will not be painful.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.887
Don't worry about me, Mr. Duncan.

23:06.889 --> 23:09.088
We all have to die sooner or later.

23:09.090 --> 23:11.421
Take good care of yourself.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.708
And promise me one thing.

23:13.710 --> 23:15.318
What?

23:15.320 --> 23:18.148
That you will always stand
up to that angry little boy

23:18.150 --> 23:20.048
or you will never be free.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.728
And I want you to because I love you.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.633
I still consider you my father.

23:28.983 --> 23:31.498
Take care of yourself, Mr. Duncan.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.208
I think Mr. Lombard has just arrived.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.739
I wish it never came to this, Viveca.

23:36.741 --> 23:40.858
Please, run for your life.

23:40.860 --> 23:42.308
It is too late now.

23:42.310 --> 23:43.798
There's no escape.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.625
I have to prepare for what comes next.

23:46.627 --> 23:48.230
Forgive me, Viveca.

23:49.110 --> 23:51.678
Mr. Duncan, it's the
people who damaged you

23:51.680 --> 23:52.673
that I blame.

23:53.541 --> 23:56.248
Society turned a little
boy into a monster.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.273
Farewell, Mr. Duncan.

24:16.734 --> 24:18.338
Hi.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.432
I'm assuming you're Viveca.

24:20.434 --> 24:22.048
You are Chris Lombard?

24:22.050 --> 24:23.538
Yes, I am.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.528
Hello, how are you doing?

24:25.530 --> 24:27.466
It's quite lonely out here.

24:27.468 --> 24:29.988
We could have had this
meeting in my office.

24:29.990 --> 24:32.038
It's okay, we can talk in my car.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.118
Are you sure?

24:33.120 --> 24:34.603
Why not, come on in.

24:40.741 --> 24:43.008
Are you comfortable?

24:43.010 --> 24:45.278
Yeah, please go ahead and tell me

24:45.280 --> 24:46.363
everything you know.

24:47.260 --> 24:49.093
And what would happen after that?

24:50.010 --> 24:53.468
We can then figure out
the best way to help you.

24:53.470 --> 24:55.713
Okay, I will tell you everything.

25:00.142 --> 25:01.948
I was an elementary
school teacher in Haiti

25:01.950 --> 25:03.588
for three years.

25:03.590 --> 25:06.538
Then one day, there was an earthquake.

25:06.540 --> 25:11.498
My parents, my brothers,
my sisters, cousins,

25:11.500 --> 25:15.618
nephews, friends, neighbors, and the man

25:15.620 --> 25:17.683
I was about to marry all died.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.860
Everybody I had died.

25:20.862 --> 25:22.898
That's quite unfortunate.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.828
The ground simply opened up

25:24.830 --> 25:27.218
and swallowed my entire village.

25:27.220 --> 25:31.612
And about 50 others, about one
third of the whole country.

25:31.614 --> 25:35.308
I survived because I was
attending a convention

25:35.310 --> 25:38.728
for elementary school
teachers in another town

25:38.730 --> 25:41.408
that miraculously was spared.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.518
I'm sorry that you lost everybody,

25:43.520 --> 25:45.724
that so many lives were lost.

25:45.726 --> 25:48.758
That must be quite traumatizing.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.888
I cried so much.

25:50.890 --> 25:54.168
After a while, I could
no longer shed tears.

25:54.170 --> 25:56.938
I don't cry anymore, no
matter how hard I try.

25:56.940 --> 26:00.036
No matter how much somebody hurts me.

26:00.038 --> 26:03.678
I think you suffered
severe emotional shock.

26:03.680 --> 26:08.178
A psychological damage which
may or may not be permanent.

26:08.180 --> 26:11.638
How did you get to America?

26:11.640 --> 26:14.878
An American man that I met
at the hotel I was staying

26:14.880 --> 26:18.688
for teacher's convention
promised to help me

26:18.690 --> 26:21.908
start a new life in the United States.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.688
He arranged for everything.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.643
It didn't cost me any money.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.638
And he didn't try to make me a prostitute.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.943
Before you ask, he did
not have sex with me.

26:34.180 --> 26:37.048
And never tried to make me his girlfriend.

26:37.050 --> 26:39.788
The only catch, he wanted me to work

26:39.790 --> 26:41.948
for a certain company in America

26:41.950 --> 26:43.638
for at least one year.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.158
Because that company
pays him a lot of money

26:46.160 --> 26:48.928
to find good foreigners to work for them

26:48.930 --> 26:52.768
for very cheap wages that
are illegal in America.

26:52.770 --> 26:53.820
That's interesting.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.817
Please, continue.

27:00.330 --> 27:02.586
I need to know everything you know

27:02.588 --> 27:05.178
before I can help you.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.938
Okay, although the man
treated me very nicely,

27:08.940 --> 27:12.668
something about him made me very uneasy.

27:12.670 --> 27:14.778
But I went along because I felt

27:14.780 --> 27:18.628
that I needed an escape
from all the misery

27:18.630 --> 27:21.228
and suffering that surrounded me.

27:21.230 --> 27:22.730
That's quite understandable.

27:23.750 --> 27:28.128
He was my only chance to
get out so I took that chance

27:28.130 --> 27:31.358
but I kept my eyes and ears wide open

27:31.360 --> 27:32.743
and I learned a lot.

27:33.670 --> 27:34.988
Like what?

27:34.990 --> 27:37.828
Well, for one, I learned that

27:37.830 --> 27:39.848
he worked for a man named Cosmo.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.278
C. Cosmo.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.888
You know him, right?

27:42.890 --> 27:44.488
No, I don't.

27:44.490 --> 27:47.178
What do you know about Mr. Cosmo?

27:47.180 --> 27:49.928
He runs an organization that smuggles

27:49.930 --> 27:52.458
a certain kind of people into this country

27:52.460 --> 27:54.666
from all over the world.

27:54.668 --> 27:58.298
People that are so poor and have very few

27:58.300 --> 28:01.638
or no relatives so that if they die

28:01.640 --> 28:05.028
or disappear in America,
nobody will bother

28:05.030 --> 28:07.368
searching very hard for them.

28:07.370 --> 28:10.498
These very unfortunate
people are then used

28:10.500 --> 28:11.948
for life insurance scam.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.528
Is that true?

28:13.530 --> 28:14.888
I know it's true.

28:14.890 --> 28:17.878
And I know that some shady employers

28:17.880 --> 28:20.778
secretly take big life insurance policies

28:20.780 --> 28:23.358
on these helpless illegal aliens

28:23.360 --> 28:25.178
without their knowledge.

28:25.180 --> 28:29.418
And then after a while,
maybe one year or two,

28:29.420 --> 28:31.658
something bad happens to them.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.748
They die and your
insurance company pays out

28:34.750 --> 28:37.858
millions of dollars to the
owners of these companies.

28:37.860 --> 28:41.428
Tell me, are you getting
kickbacks from that?

28:41.430 --> 28:44.028
Because I overheard so many conversations.

28:44.030 --> 28:45.288
You have some balls.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.288
I'm a real woman.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.918
I don't have testicles.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.178
I have a vagina.

28:50.180 --> 28:52.028
And I fear only God.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.615
You're dead!

29:35.864 --> 29:36.998
Hello.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.558
Rafer, I'm alive and
talking to you right now

29:40.560 --> 29:43.128
because body armor stopped two bullets

29:43.130 --> 29:45.688
from ripping through my heart and lungs.

29:45.690 --> 29:47.921
Armor didn't stop the bullets all the way

29:47.923 --> 29:51.608
because I was shot at
extremely close range.

29:51.610 --> 29:54.908
I suffer flesh wounds but
nothing life threatening.

29:54.910 --> 29:56.578
Who shot you?

29:56.580 --> 29:58.678
Your girl Viveca.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.838
She's on her way to get you.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.538
Viveca would never hurt a fly.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.918
Well I guess you didn't
know her well enough.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.848
And another thing, she
was prepared for me.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.916
You tipped her off, Rafer.

30:11.918 --> 30:12.981
I did not.

30:12.983 --> 30:15.038
Viveca's a very smart girl.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.918
I hate that it's come to this!

30:16.920 --> 30:19.348
Well she's angry as hell.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.263
And she told me you're next, Rafer.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.529
You need to contact the
contractor right away

30:26.531 --> 30:30.488
and arrange for him to
take care of this problem

30:30.490 --> 30:34.158
like the others, as quickly as possible.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.178
Your life is on the line now.

30:37.180 --> 30:41.342
Also, my team and I have
another proposal for you.

30:41.344 --> 30:43.688
What proposal?

30:43.690 --> 30:46.838
Not something we can
discuss over the phone.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.958
I'll come by your place.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.298
Are you sure Viveca's
threatened to harm me?

30:51.300 --> 30:53.398
Have I ever lied to you, Rafer?

30:53.400 --> 30:56.769
You're a former spy, a trained liar.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.732
Never caught you lying to me before.

30:58.734 --> 31:01.414
But that doesn't mean you're
not lying to me right now.

31:01.416 --> 31:03.343
Take your chances then.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.313
Okay.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.083
I'll do it.

31:15.281 --> 31:16.531
The demons won.

31:21.155 --> 31:23.148
It's for all our sake, Rafer.

31:23.150 --> 31:26.242
Call me after you've
met with the contractor.

31:26.244 --> 31:28.063
Okay.

31:28.065 --> 31:29.133
We'll talk later.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.528
Mr. Duncan,
can you get me a gun?

31:52.530 --> 31:54.208
What do you need a gun for?

31:54.210 --> 31:55.358
For protection.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.111
Protection from who?

31:57.113 --> 32:01.068
From any of these bad guys
that we've been dealing with.

32:01.070 --> 32:05.018
Cosmos men, I think something
bad is going to happen.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.688
Sooner or later.

32:06.690 --> 32:09.848
And it's good to be prepared just in case.

32:09.850 --> 32:10.753
We're careful.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.478
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.098
Besides, you don't know
anything about guns anyway.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.818
They could hurt you.

32:18.820 --> 32:22.008
I know a lot about guns, Mr. Duncan.

32:22.010 --> 32:24.878
In Haiti I attended the police academy

32:24.880 --> 32:28.122
where they taught me how to
use different types of guns.

32:28.124 --> 32:29.937
Oh yeah?

32:29.939 --> 32:34.640
Yeah, at first I wanted
to become a police officer.

32:34.642 --> 32:37.598
That's a big surprise.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.688
But I left the academy
after only six weeks

32:40.690 --> 32:44.018
and became a school teacher instead.

32:44.020 --> 32:45.428
Why?

32:45.430 --> 32:50.068
Because I realized that I
really love being around kids.

32:50.070 --> 32:51.888
That's wonderful.

32:51.890 --> 32:53.640
So are you going to get me a gun?

32:54.520 --> 32:57.858
Because if not, I'll
get one on the streets.

32:57.860 --> 33:00.119
No, I can't buy you a gun.

33:00.121 --> 33:02.058
And you shouldn't be
going out on the streets

33:02.060 --> 33:03.298
looking for one either.

33:03.300 --> 33:06.668
You can get yourself into a
whole lot of trouble like that.

33:06.670 --> 33:08.778
That's good advice, Mr. Duncan.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.798
Thank you very much.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.168
But something tells me you're gonna

33:12.170 --> 33:13.883
get yourself a gun anyway.

33:14.810 --> 33:17.018
You've got to be careful, Viveca.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.998
Let's change the subject.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.733
Can I come use the swimming pool tomorrow?

33:21.735 --> 33:23.614
Yeah, sure.

33:23.616 --> 33:26.468
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.957
Sometimes it feels like an angel

33:50.959 --> 33:54.198
and a demon are both living inside of me.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.998
And on very rare occasions
the angel is able

33:57.000 --> 33:58.223
to subdue the demon.

33:59.157 --> 34:02.291
But more often than not, the
demon clobbers the angel.

34:02.293 --> 34:05.370
The angry little boy inside me

34:05.372 --> 34:07.873
will not let me do the right thing.

34:09.020 --> 34:13.342
It's a very powerful demon
that I can't seem to overcome.

34:14.561 --> 34:17.971
The damage that was
done to me was complete.

34:35.072 --> 34:35.905
Coming.

34:39.716 --> 34:40.632
I'm coming.

34:46.367 --> 34:47.768
Hi, Rafer.

34:47.771 --> 34:48.603
Chris.

34:51.855 --> 34:53.158
Ordering a hit on
somebody you care about

34:53.159 --> 34:55.420
wasn't part of the original plan.

34:55.422 --> 34:56.963
But things happen.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.835
It's all right Chris, we all must do

34:59.837 --> 35:01.403
what we have to do.

35:01.405 --> 35:03.328
You want a drink, Chris?

35:03.330 --> 35:06.038
Sure, that's the right attitude.

35:06.040 --> 35:06.940
Coming right up.

35:24.650 --> 35:26.238
Here.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.073
Thanks.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.218
What's the matter, you look miserable.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.208
Anger can be such a destructive force.

35:36.210 --> 35:37.858
In what way?

35:37.860 --> 35:40.208
Well, this whole thing started

35:40.210 --> 35:43.570
because I was angry at the
owners of the insurance company

35:44.507 --> 35:47.198
and the greedy and stingy Chief Executive.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.918
This is the first time
I'm hearing this, Chris.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.608
About time, right?

35:51.610 --> 35:53.618
Rafer Duncan.

35:53.620 --> 35:56.658
I'm one of the best
insurance fraud investigators

35:56.660 --> 35:58.308
in the industry.

35:58.310 --> 36:01.018
Along with my dream team of investigators

36:01.020 --> 36:04.138
which I put together, we solve hundreds

36:04.140 --> 36:06.098
of fraudulent claims every year,

36:06.100 --> 36:09.433
saving the company hundreds
of millions of dollars.

36:10.290 --> 36:14.958
Our work has helped law
enforcement put many behind bars.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.131
What did I get in return?

36:17.133 --> 36:22.133
200,000 dollars a year
and a 35,000 dollar bonus.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.298
While the Chief Executive takes home

36:24.300 --> 36:27.948
four to six million plus
hundreds of thousands

36:27.950 --> 36:31.273
of dollars in bonuses plus stock options.

36:33.030 --> 36:35.138
I pleaded with him to up my salary

36:35.140 --> 36:37.828
and give my team a 20 percent increase.

36:37.830 --> 36:40.198
They cost the company two million

36:40.200 --> 36:42.318
while their tireless
efforts earn the company

36:42.320 --> 36:44.428
more than 100 million a year.

36:44.430 --> 36:45.480
He turned you down.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.528
He not only turned me down,

36:48.530 --> 36:51.376
he threatened to fire me if I persisted.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.503
Can you believe?

36:53.610 --> 36:55.915
I see where you're going with this.

36:55.917 --> 37:00.728
You were the good guy who
was unduly compensated.

37:00.730 --> 37:01.750
So you got angry

37:02.608 --> 37:04.590
and you decided to seek revenge.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.908
You came up with a concept

37:07.910 --> 37:12.198
but you needed an evil genius
to flesh it out and execute.

37:12.200 --> 37:16.158
And wallah, Rafer Duncan,
your old neighborhood friend

37:16.160 --> 37:17.123
to the rescue.

37:21.789 --> 37:22.620
We had a good run.

37:22.622 --> 37:25.138
We made a tidy fortune in
a short amount of time.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.268
Now that something's gone wrong,

37:27.270 --> 37:28.238
you have deep regrets.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.598
And you wanna leave me holding the bag.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.188
Rafer.

37:33.190 --> 37:35.288
Nobody's leaving you holding the bag.

37:35.290 --> 37:39.528
Instead, we'd like you to
consider leaving the country

37:39.530 --> 37:41.318
as soon as possible.

37:41.320 --> 37:45.248
Retire now to a country that
has no extradition treaty

37:45.250 --> 37:46.903
with the United States.

37:48.110 --> 37:52.228
So this is the new
proposal you had in mind?

37:52.230 --> 37:54.308
You're asking Rafer Duncan

37:54.310 --> 37:56.908
to become an international fugitive

37:56.910 --> 37:58.698
while you stay and eat apple pie

37:58.700 --> 38:01.188
in the good old U.S. of A.?

38:01.190 --> 38:02.828
Just a thought.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.338
Why didn't you just quit your job

38:04.340 --> 38:07.378
if you were so unhappy with your employer?

38:07.380 --> 38:09.305
We wouldn't be in this situation

38:09.307 --> 38:11.218
if you would have just done that.

38:11.220 --> 38:14.704
Rafer, I couldn't just quit.

38:14.706 --> 38:17.138
There's another aspect to all of these

38:17.140 --> 38:19.538
that I've never discussed with you

38:19.540 --> 38:22.858
nor with anyone else outside
of a very close circle

38:22.860 --> 38:25.258
of investigators at the firm.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.233
Well, you've got my attention.

38:28.190 --> 38:30.423
People were getting away with murder.

38:31.447 --> 38:36.447
Using exotic poisons to murder
their spouses and children.

38:37.050 --> 38:39.648
Chemical compounds that
law enforcement labs

38:39.650 --> 38:41.808
were unable to detect.

38:41.810 --> 38:44.568
It turns out there is an
international black market

38:44.570 --> 38:47.858
for these untraceable and deadly poisons

38:47.860 --> 38:51.128
developed by a foreign
intelligence agency.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.363
How did you find out?

38:56.096 --> 38:58.568
Back in my days as a
defense intelligence officer,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.568
I spent plenty of time overseas

39:00.570 --> 39:04.308
and made good friends with some
of my foreign counterparts.

39:04.310 --> 39:06.428
We kept in touch over the years.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.832
One of them not only tipped me off

39:08.834 --> 39:13.463
but trained me how to detect the poison.

39:14.610 --> 39:18.378
But the CEO would rather
pay off millions of dollars

39:18.380 --> 39:22.498
on these claims knowing people
were getting away with murder

39:22.500 --> 39:25.478
because he didn't want any link whatsoever

39:25.480 --> 39:29.058
between the firm and a
foreign intelligence service.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.238
Wow, that's a bombshell.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.098
The payouts were a drop in the bucket

39:34.100 --> 39:37.248
compared to the kind of
money the firm brings in.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.168
People are living longer.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.788
More and more are
surviving ghastly accidents

39:41.790 --> 39:43.868
and life-threatening diseases.

39:43.870 --> 39:47.098
And the premiums keep flowing in.

39:47.100 --> 39:50.288
Bankrolling sound investments.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.238
So what did you do?

39:52.240 --> 39:55.088
I just couldn't live with myself, Rafer.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.358
I went to my contacts in law enforcement

39:57.360 --> 40:00.208
and shared what I'd learned.

40:00.210 --> 40:02.038
Some cases were reopened.

40:02.040 --> 40:05.498
And it led to several murder convictions.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.523
So you disobeyed your Chief Executive

40:08.525 --> 40:10.783
for the good of your country.

40:11.690 --> 40:13.738
Now look at what you'd become.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.408
A co-conspirator.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.578
In half a dozen murders.

40:17.580 --> 40:22.580
I just said that anger is
such a destructive force.

40:23.510 --> 40:27.515
I apologized to the CEO
for doing what I had to do.

40:27.517 --> 40:30.503
He said not to worry about it

40:30.505 --> 40:33.968
and that he was relieved and
happy that law enforcement

40:33.970 --> 40:38.715
now had a new capability
in solving more homicides.

40:38.717 --> 40:43.358
Then, three months later,
two listening devices

40:43.360 --> 40:45.625
were found in the boardroom

40:45.627 --> 40:47.228
at the Chief Executive's office.

40:47.230 --> 40:48.063
No kidding?

40:48.940 --> 40:50.208
Who found them?

40:50.210 --> 40:52.568
A private security
firm had been contracted

40:52.570 --> 40:54.590
to perform weekly sweeps for bugs

40:55.824 --> 40:56.908
before I even joined the company.

40:56.910 --> 41:00.090
As a Fortune 500 company,
it's part of a series

41:01.110 --> 41:03.518
of countermeasures to guard
against hostile takeovers,

41:03.520 --> 41:06.608
insider trading and industrial espionage.

41:06.610 --> 41:08.080
I see.

41:08.082 --> 41:10.428
Is there a punchline?

41:10.430 --> 41:11.948
Yeah.

41:11.950 --> 41:14.968
We found out through my
contacts in the intelligence

41:14.970 --> 41:18.130
and law enforcement
community that both devices

41:18.132 --> 41:20.958
were manufactured specifically

41:20.960 --> 41:23.943
for FBI foreign counter
intelligence division.

41:28.074 --> 41:30.138
The implication being
that the US government

41:30.140 --> 41:32.968
is taking a closer look to be sure that

41:32.970 --> 41:35.728
your insurance company
which invests heavily

41:35.730 --> 41:38.678
in our high tech industry
has not been infiltrated

41:38.680 --> 41:41.298
by a foreign spy agency.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.123
Smart move, I can't blame them.

41:45.020 --> 41:49.248
And my guess is that's what
your CEO wanted to avoid.

41:49.250 --> 41:52.078
And probably why you
didn't get your raise.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.783
But you still haven't
answered my question.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.978
Why didn't you just quit?

41:57.980 --> 42:00.378
Why didn't you move to another company

42:00.380 --> 42:04.283
of start your own business
if you're so unhappy?

42:05.210 --> 42:06.923
I wanted to hurt him.

42:08.457 --> 42:10.457
Really hurt the company.

42:12.432 --> 42:17.432
But I can only pull that
off working from the inside.

42:17.810 --> 42:21.148
We've taken 25 million dollars from them.

42:21.150 --> 42:23.958
We've also taken innocent lives.

42:23.960 --> 42:24.793
Rafer.

42:26.013 --> 42:27.148
They're illegals.

42:27.150 --> 42:29.468
Undocumented aliens who had no right

42:29.470 --> 42:31.611
sneaking into this country.

42:31.613 --> 42:33.063
They didn't deserve to die.

42:34.620 --> 42:37.383
Well, what's done is done.

42:38.340 --> 42:39.173
Chris.

42:40.768 --> 42:44.073
You're a very complicated man.

42:44.075 --> 42:45.938
You sound like you have regrets.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.290
And you sound like you
have a mental illness.

42:49.170 --> 42:52.558
Yes, I regret going along with your plan.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.608
I allowed greed to cloud my judgment.

42:55.610 --> 42:59.128
Now in order to save myself,

42:59.130 --> 43:03.248
I have to destroy a very
compassionate young woman

43:03.250 --> 43:06.797
who's been just like the
daughter I never had.

43:08.072 --> 43:09.905
I resent you for that.

43:10.784 --> 43:11.955
Rafer.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.931
Maybe I'm better
off talking to the police.

43:47.933 --> 43:50.560
What's the worst that can happen?

43:50.562 --> 43:53.247
They'll get immigration to send me back

43:53.249 --> 43:55.452
to where I came from.

43:55.454 --> 43:58.371
That isn't what you want.

43:59.298 --> 44:01.381
That isn't what you want.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.323
That isn't what you want.

44:10.192 --> 44:12.599
To the police, to the police.

44:12.601 --> 44:15.934
They'll get immigration to send me back.

44:39.650 --> 44:40.483
Coming.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.770
What is so urgent, Rafer?

44:47.738 --> 44:49.281
Have a seat, Mason.

44:49.283 --> 44:50.198
There's plenty to talk about.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.268
Your timing is terrible.

44:52.270 --> 44:55.018
My mistress was really
upset I had to leave her.

44:55.020 --> 44:57.271
Which mistress are you talking about?

44:57.273 --> 44:58.768
The prostitute or the drug addict?

44:58.770 --> 45:00.228
She stopped being a call girl.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.658
It's her drug habit.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.808
It's a 5,000 dollar a month drug habit

45:03.810 --> 45:05.138
that she's trying to kick.

45:05.140 --> 45:07.218
She makes me happy, Rafer.

45:07.220 --> 45:10.238
I just bought her a gorgeous
penthouse in South Beach.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.111
It set me back a million dollars

45:12.113 --> 45:14.638
but she's worth every penny.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.438
You went and bought
your mistress a penthouse

45:17.440 --> 45:22.389
for a million dollars while
your wife of 27 years and you

45:22.391 --> 45:25.818
live in a three bedroom condo?

45:25.820 --> 45:29.008
I just want to fulfill my
fantasy of being a playboy,

45:29.010 --> 45:32.378
screwing hot young women
and throwing money around.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.628
Let me guess.

45:33.630 --> 45:35.868
She's got you doing drugs.

45:35.870 --> 45:39.368
Just for recreation, to
enhance sexual performance.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.265
Nothing serious.

45:41.267 --> 45:43.388
Really?

45:43.390 --> 45:46.118
You finally found a new way of life.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.217
Throwing money around and doing drugs.

45:49.219 --> 45:53.188
Whatever happened to that smart, cautious

45:53.190 --> 45:56.645
Chief Medical Examiner
that I partnered with

45:56.647 --> 45:59.608
for the last five years now?

45:59.610 --> 46:01.261
I'm careful.

46:01.263 --> 46:02.657
Enough about me.

46:02.659 --> 46:03.658
You said it was urgent that we meet.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.183
So let's get on with it.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.788
Well there comes a time in life

46:07.790 --> 46:11.618
where a man must do whatever he has to do

46:11.620 --> 46:13.515
for self-preservation.

46:13.517 --> 46:15.933
I'm not following you.

46:15.935 --> 46:18.938
Nothing lasts forever, Mason.

46:18.940 --> 46:22.473
There's a beginning and
an end to all that we do.

46:25.037 --> 46:26.940
And the end is here and now.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.479
Are we alone?

46:32.481 --> 46:35.693
As far as I know, yes.

46:37.210 --> 46:40.638
Look Rafer, I've been good to you

46:40.640 --> 46:43.418
covering up year after year

46:43.420 --> 46:45.948
and victim after victim.

46:45.950 --> 46:48.768
You've gotten away with so much.

46:48.770 --> 46:50.798
And you've been well paid.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.968
My partners inside the insurance company

46:53.970 --> 46:55.023
have to be protected.

46:56.020 --> 46:57.378
By killing me?

46:57.380 --> 47:00.368
Why, what the hell happened?

47:00.370 --> 47:03.958
They found out somebody
tried to blow the whistle.

47:03.960 --> 47:06.938
It wasn't me, I swear it wasn't me.

47:06.940 --> 47:08.268
I know.

47:08.270 --> 47:10.458
Turns out one of my employees figured out

47:10.460 --> 47:13.053
a small part of our grand design.

47:14.257 --> 47:15.628
And rather than going to the police,

47:15.630 --> 47:17.108
she called the insurance company

47:17.110 --> 47:20.398
and set up a meeting with
the Chief Investigator

47:20.400 --> 47:21.763
who quickly alerted me.

47:22.810 --> 47:26.513
I've taken steps to control the situation.

47:27.540 --> 47:29.633
Meaning the whistle blower is dead?

47:30.803 --> 47:33.158
I'd say it's a work in progress

47:33.160 --> 47:36.323
that has turned into
something quite distasteful.

47:37.190 --> 47:38.378
Who else knows?

47:38.380 --> 47:40.688
And why didn't the
whistleblower go to the cops?

47:40.690 --> 47:44.301
Would you have preferred
that she'd gone to the police?

47:44.303 --> 47:46.338
No, I'm just asking.

47:46.340 --> 47:49.718
It's all messed up, it's really messed up.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.698
Sorry, I have to cover my tracks.

47:51.700 --> 47:52.638
So do I.

47:57.669 --> 47:59.298
What a waste.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.060
I need a hard drink.

48:15.110 --> 48:17.258
I must confess that I invited you here

48:17.260 --> 48:18.360
under false pretenses.

48:20.740 --> 48:21.603
Yeah you did?

48:22.792 --> 48:23.648
It's okay, Cosmo.

48:23.650 --> 48:26.456
This meeting isn't about business.

48:26.458 --> 48:28.763
It's of a personal nature.

48:29.880 --> 48:32.258
What are you getting at, Rafer?

48:32.260 --> 48:34.728
Well, simply out of curiosity,

48:34.730 --> 48:36.948
I wanted to find out if we might have

48:36.950 --> 48:40.818
more in common from a
psychological perspective.

48:40.820 --> 48:43.598
Cosmo, my soul is in a very unique place.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.163
It's a place of perpetual sadness.

48:49.350 --> 48:51.315
All the money that I've made

48:51.317 --> 48:54.678
has not altered this
dreadful feeling inside me

48:54.680 --> 48:56.583
that is invisible to others.

48:57.865 --> 48:59.933
So sorry to hear that, Rafer.

49:01.366 --> 49:05.163
Cosmo, do you ever feel that way?

49:06.360 --> 49:07.698
Nah, never.

49:07.700 --> 49:09.448
Rafer, it's kind of late.

49:09.450 --> 49:11.049
And I have to go.

49:11.051 --> 49:12.453
What, you just got here.

49:12.455 --> 49:13.906
Did I say something that offended you?

49:13.908 --> 49:15.848
If so, I'm sorry.

49:15.850 --> 49:17.913
Please sit down and finish your drink.

49:18.810 --> 49:20.958
Rafer, I'm a professional.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.898
I don't talk about my personal life.

49:22.900 --> 49:25.498
Okay, I'm sorry that I went there.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.573
It will never happen again.

49:27.575 --> 49:30.178
We'll talk politics.

49:30.180 --> 49:32.038
That's always a safe bet.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.218
I hate politics.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.878
Okay, we'll talk tennis.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.530
I hate that too.

49:36.532 --> 49:37.363
I hate everything.

49:37.365 --> 49:39.258
Why do you hate everything?

49:39.260 --> 49:42.251
Rafer, you have just opened the door

49:42.253 --> 49:46.238
that has been closed and
locked with several keys

49:46.240 --> 49:48.408
for so many years now.

49:48.410 --> 49:51.817
Please walk me through
the door before it closes.

49:51.819 --> 49:53.337
It might do you some good.

49:54.380 --> 49:56.245
It might cost you your life

49:56.247 --> 49:58.328
if I don't like the outcome.

49:58.330 --> 50:00.078
It's a chance I'm willing to take

50:00.080 --> 50:03.238
because it appears we
may have more in common.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.918
Why do you want to be so
reckless with your life?

50:05.920 --> 50:08.768
Because I don't have a life.

50:08.770 --> 50:10.548
And knowing another soul

50:10.550 --> 50:12.954
that's also trapped in the same place

50:12.956 --> 50:15.598
might give me a life.

50:15.600 --> 50:17.348
As the saying goes,

50:17.350 --> 50:20.855
birds of the same feather flock together.

50:20.857 --> 50:23.372
And there's the other one.

50:23.374 --> 50:26.505
There's strength in numbers.

50:26.507 --> 50:29.528
39 years is a long time

50:29.530 --> 50:31.071
to work for a single company

50:31.073 --> 50:35.258
and not miss a single day
of work or show up late.

50:35.260 --> 50:37.484
That's almost a lifetime of work.

50:37.486 --> 50:39.701
Who might that be?

50:39.703 --> 50:41.498
My father.

50:41.500 --> 50:45.058
But 40 years earlier, when he
graduated from high school,

50:45.060 --> 50:48.438
he spent only two weeks
packing asbestos in a factory

50:48.440 --> 50:51.058
so that he can have enough
money to buy my mother,

50:51.060 --> 50:54.261
his high school sweetheart,
an engagement ring.

50:54.263 --> 50:57.509
It caught up with him 40 years later.

50:57.511 --> 50:59.068
Lung cancer.

50:59.070 --> 51:01.298
I'm sorry to hear that.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.968
Please don't feel sorry for me.

51:02.970 --> 51:04.729
I don't deserve pity.

51:04.731 --> 51:07.218
Anyway.

51:07.220 --> 51:09.298
My father got very sick.

51:09.300 --> 51:12.823
Decades after the asbestos
factory had got out of business.

51:12.825 --> 51:16.858
The company he had given
39 years of his life

51:16.860 --> 51:20.443
was quite helpful and
understanding for quite a while.

51:21.390 --> 51:23.168
But my father wasn't getting any better.

51:23.170 --> 51:26.533
When his medical bills
reached 800,000 dollars,

51:26.535 --> 51:28.497
they fired him.

51:28.499 --> 51:30.543
Can you blame them?

51:31.559 --> 51:32.983
Quite unfortunate.

51:34.270 --> 51:38.168
Nine months later, we were
facing foreclosure on our home.

51:38.170 --> 51:40.070
Then the electricity was disconnected.

51:40.937 --> 51:43.755
Friends and relatives
had done all they could

51:43.757 --> 51:46.998
and you couldn't raise money
on the internet at the time.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.168
My mother and I worked two
jobs to keep my father alive

51:50.170 --> 51:51.320
and sustain our family.

51:52.770 --> 51:55.122
But it was only a drop in the bucket.

51:55.124 --> 51:58.638
That winter was quite brutal in New York.

51:58.640 --> 52:00.538
You grew up in New York?

52:00.540 --> 52:01.373
Yeah.

52:02.665 --> 52:04.798
A few days after the
electricity was shut off,

52:04.800 --> 52:07.718
I bought a used generator
at a bargain price

52:07.720 --> 52:09.768
at a garage sale to keep my dad

52:09.770 --> 52:12.078
and the rest of my family warm

52:12.080 --> 52:14.198
since there was no heat in the house.

52:14.200 --> 52:17.688
I left home at night to
work the graveyard shift

52:17.690 --> 52:20.208
leaving my mother and my three brothers,

52:20.210 --> 52:24.363
and my sister who had just
had a baby boy, Hector.

52:26.270 --> 52:27.763
He was only nine days old.

52:30.757 --> 52:31.590
But,

52:32.514 --> 52:35.420
when I got home that following morning,

52:39.110 --> 52:40.010
they had all died.

52:42.790 --> 52:44.758
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

52:44.760 --> 52:45.593
Cosmo.

52:46.800 --> 52:49.783
That's one of the saddest
stories that I ever heard.

52:51.610 --> 52:54.878
The Fire Department found
the generator defective.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.358
It leaked poisonous odorless gas all night

52:57.360 --> 52:59.198
while my family slept.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.953
We had smoke detectors in the house.

53:03.897 --> 53:07.217
But not carbon monoxide detectors.

53:10.669 --> 53:13.458
My deepest sympathy, Cosmo.

53:13.460 --> 53:16.208
I already told you, don't pity me.

53:16.210 --> 53:19.568
Believe it or not, the person
who sold me the generator

53:19.570 --> 53:22.428
admitted to the police,
he knew the generator

53:22.430 --> 53:23.647
leaked poisonous gas.

53:26.237 --> 53:29.248
And instead of getting
rid of it the proper way,

53:29.250 --> 53:30.793
he decided to make some money.

53:32.450 --> 53:34.318
I killed him a few months later

53:34.320 --> 53:36.488
and got away with it.

53:36.490 --> 53:38.690
And that's how I became
a ruthless criminal.

53:47.410 --> 53:49.838
Miss Fouquier, I'm
on the road right now,

53:49.840 --> 53:51.768
I have a flight to catch.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.968
But I'll give you free advice right away

53:53.970 --> 53:56.488
since your predicament
appears to be quite serious

53:56.490 --> 53:58.568
and potentially life-threatening.

53:58.570 --> 54:00.168
Thank you, Mr. Princeton.

54:00.170 --> 54:02.858
Don't thank me until you
hear what I have to say.

54:02.860 --> 54:05.188
I've been practicing
immigration law in this country

54:05.190 --> 54:07.608
for over eight years, Miss Fouquier.

54:07.610 --> 54:10.108
And I can tell you right
now that the US Government

54:10.110 --> 54:15.110
can not and will not grant
you a legal residency status

54:15.300 --> 54:17.738
just because you reported
this hideous crime

54:17.740 --> 54:20.338
that you alleged is taking place

54:20.340 --> 54:23.328
because first and foremost,
you have unwittingly

54:23.330 --> 54:25.098
become a criminal.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.218
What?

54:26.220 --> 54:28.748
Well according to you, Miss Fouquier,

54:28.750 --> 54:30.468
you delivered the money to the traffickers

54:30.470 --> 54:33.858
on several occasions
and you've had knowledge

54:33.860 --> 54:37.008
of this operation for quite a few years.

54:37.010 --> 54:39.488
You've known for quite sometime

54:39.490 --> 54:42.178
that people were being murdered

54:42.180 --> 54:45.590
and you essentially have
been functioning as a courier

54:45.592 --> 54:48.528
enabling these felonious activities.

54:48.530 --> 54:49.778
What is felonious?

54:49.780 --> 54:51.618
I don't know big English.

54:51.620 --> 54:53.498
It means very serious crimes

54:53.500 --> 54:55.648
that are punished more severely.

54:55.650 --> 54:58.508
My advice to you is to
get out of the country

54:58.510 --> 55:00.398
as quickly as you can.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.218
Before the authorities catch up with you

55:02.220 --> 55:04.798
because I can assure you
that you will be sent

55:04.800 --> 55:07.808
to prison for several
years if you're caught.

55:07.810 --> 55:09.193
Me, a criminal?

55:10.070 --> 55:13.416
Mr. Preston, I am not a criminal.

55:13.418 --> 55:17.249
I'm a very good girl in
a very bad situation.

55:17.251 --> 55:19.578
And I did what I had to
do in order to survive.

55:19.580 --> 55:21.468
Can you understand that?

55:21.470 --> 55:24.568
Miss Fouquier, I will
not have a debate with you.

55:24.570 --> 55:26.638
I'm just giving you my
professional opinion

55:26.640 --> 55:28.538
and advice free of charge.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.403
What you do is up to you.

55:31.562 --> 55:32.438
You're certainly welcome to consult

55:32.440 --> 55:34.188
with other immigration attorneys.

55:34.190 --> 55:36.390
But I doubt that their
opinions will differ.

55:37.900 --> 55:40.838
I wish you luck in resolving your dilemma.

55:40.840 --> 55:43.108
Thank you for the free consultation.

55:43.110 --> 55:45.098
I'm sorry I'm mad at you.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.968
I know I'm a good girl.

55:46.970 --> 55:49.558
Miss Fouquier,
sometimes the truth can be

55:49.560 --> 55:52.368
a very bitter pill to swallow.

55:52.370 --> 55:54.028
And in the event that you're picked up,

55:54.030 --> 55:55.763
you can hire me to defend you.

55:56.820 --> 55:58.928
I have experience working the system.

55:58.930 --> 56:01.498
I bill 250 dollars per hour

56:01.500 --> 56:05.058
and I must be paid a
retainer of 7,000 dollars.

56:05.060 --> 56:07.711
Wow, I do not have that kind of money.

56:07.713 --> 56:12.017
Miss Fouquier, we live by
the choices we make in life.

56:12.019 --> 56:14.228
Best of luck to you.

56:14.230 --> 56:15.883
Same to you, bye.

56:17.230 --> 56:19.083
Oh my god, I'm in big trouble.

56:32.150 --> 56:33.684
Hello, Mr. Duncan.

56:33.686 --> 56:35.089
Hello.

56:35.091 --> 56:37.305
Mr. Lombard tried to
kill me as you had warned

56:37.307 --> 56:39.256
but I'm still alive.

56:39.258 --> 56:41.188
Viveca, I'm so glad to hear that.

56:41.190 --> 56:42.958
Where are you now?

56:42.960 --> 56:46.658
Who is asking, the angel or the demon?

56:46.660 --> 56:47.513
The angel.

56:48.380 --> 56:52.472
Sometimes, the demon
pretends to be an angel.

56:52.474 --> 56:56.128
Viveca, do you have faith in God?

56:56.130 --> 56:57.458
Always.

56:57.460 --> 56:59.501
Then you have nothing to fear.

56:59.503 --> 57:01.078
I'm not afraid.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.748
I am being cautious.

57:02.750 --> 57:04.698
I checked into a motel.

57:04.700 --> 57:07.568
I'm going to hide out
there until I figure out

57:07.570 --> 57:09.359
what to do next.

57:09.361 --> 57:12.698
I'll come by, give me the address.

57:12.700 --> 57:13.993
Okay, you got a pen?

57:29.050 --> 57:31.408
Cosmo C. Cosmo, welcome.

57:31.410 --> 57:32.241
Hi, Rafer.

57:32.243 --> 57:34.818
Punctuality is one of
your strongest qualities.

57:34.820 --> 57:35.653
How you been?

57:36.512 --> 57:37.518
Ah, I've been better.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.158
But, no bodyguards tonight?

57:40.160 --> 57:41.628
Bodyguard's off for the night.

57:41.630 --> 57:43.278
Since most of my enemies are dead.

57:43.280 --> 57:47.718
Speaking of the dead, I've
got two corpses in my bedroom.

57:47.720 --> 57:50.428
Can't quite figure out
how to dispose of them.

57:50.430 --> 57:52.518
Persons I may know?

57:52.520 --> 57:54.115
Yeah our partner at
the insurance company

57:54.117 --> 57:56.318
and the Chief Medical Examiner.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.698
Interesting.

57:57.700 --> 57:59.058
As I hinted over the phone,

57:59.060 --> 58:00.838
the cat is out of the bag.

58:00.840 --> 58:02.972
I've taken steps to protect us.

58:02.974 --> 58:05.829
Have a seat, I'll get us a drink.

58:05.831 --> 58:07.573
Stop, Rafer.

58:09.134 --> 58:09.967
Oh.

58:11.130 --> 58:12.858
Rafer, I'm sorry.

58:12.860 --> 58:15.448
I will not be having a
drink with you tonight.

58:15.450 --> 58:17.069
Obviously so.

58:17.071 --> 58:20.211
A very reliable source
has just informed me

58:20.213 --> 58:22.328
that the government is
preparing to crack down

58:22.330 --> 58:25.708
on human trafficking in the
most aggressive manner ever.

58:25.710 --> 58:28.018
My syndicate won't survive what is coming

58:28.020 --> 58:29.978
if I don't get out of the business now

58:29.980 --> 58:32.188
and cover my tracks thoroughly.

58:32.190 --> 58:34.418
At least it's nothing personal.

58:34.420 --> 58:37.248
No, it's strictly about my survival.

58:37.250 --> 58:40.378
Which lead me to my next subject, Viveca.

58:40.380 --> 58:42.538
She's on my hit list as well.

58:42.540 --> 58:43.968
I'm not surprised.

58:43.970 --> 58:45.408
Quite logical.

58:45.410 --> 58:46.908
I have to get my men involved

58:46.910 --> 58:49.019
and get rid of her very quickly.

58:49.021 --> 58:52.237
Please, is there any way I can possibly

58:52.239 --> 58:55.508
negotiate my way out of this?

58:55.510 --> 58:58.138
Go to a foreign land that
has no extradition treaties

58:58.140 --> 58:59.988
with the United States government?

58:59.990 --> 59:03.788
Where I can live out the
rest of my life quietly?

59:03.790 --> 59:06.318
Please, have mercy on an old man

59:06.320 --> 59:07.770
who's made you so much money.

59:08.956 --> 59:10.778
What do you have to offer?

59:10.780 --> 59:12.548
I know where you can find Viveca.

59:12.550 --> 59:14.763
Or at least a starting point for your men.

59:17.280 --> 59:19.060
Write down the address.

59:19.062 --> 59:22.123
Sure, there's a motel.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.433
Here.

59:32.300 --> 59:33.133
Cool.

59:34.070 --> 59:36.548
You have 24 hours to get out
of the country, my friend.

59:36.550 --> 59:38.403
I'll start packing right away.

59:39.272 --> 59:40.643
Much appreciated.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.543
Good luck, Rafer.

01:00:16.099 --> 01:00:17.908
Jasper, I don't care what it takes.

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.938
Put a dozen men on it if you have to.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.181
If by the time you get to
the motel, she's not there,

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.304
find out if she checked out already.

01:00:24.306 --> 01:00:26.684
I swear, I'll kill every single one of you

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:28.348
if that girl gets away.

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.287
Don't worry, Cosmo.

01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:31.348
I'll take care of it.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:33.128
Do I get a bonus for making this happen

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.968
in the next 24 hours?

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.788
50,000 dollar bonus.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:38.228
No loose ends, man.

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.208
Good deal.

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:41.408
I'll find her if she's
still using her cellphone.

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:42.588
Done it before.

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.698
It was quick and bloody,
but it cost extra.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.039
How much extra?

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:48.860
About 20 grand.

01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:50.158
Why?

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.128
Well the hackers whose services I use

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.508
are based offshore.

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.278
They're pricey but extremely reliable.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.428
They successfully hacked

01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.968
all the phone companies within minutes.

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.498
You might want to spend the extra cash

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.167
for your peace of mind.

01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:05.518
In case she never returns to the motel.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.788
How soon can you pick up the cash?

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.827
In 10 minutes.

01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:12.700
All right, I'll see you then.

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:13.702
Good deal.

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:37.026
All right, Speedy, we could talk.

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:38.695
What's on your mind?

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.393
Jasper, we have been
very loyal to Cosmo.

01:01:45.622 --> 01:01:46.688
Yes, yeah we have.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.118
And he's about to
shut down this company.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.332
That means we're all
gonna be out of work soon.

01:01:50.334 --> 01:01:53.356
Get another gig,
that's what I'm gonna do.

01:01:53.358 --> 01:01:55.588
Yeah but what if we could
all make a couple of millions

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:56.608
for ourselves and never
have to do the dirty work

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.338
for people like Cosmo again.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.248
I mean don't get me wrong, he pays well.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.855
But we all could retire
from this shameful life

01:02:02.857 --> 01:02:05.008
if we put our cards right.

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.266
And how do you plan on doing that?

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:07.101
Viveca.

01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:10.808
Since he's scared the girl
may turn government witness

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:14.018
against him someday, I
say we use her to extort

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.318
some cash from Cosmo.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.778
But after he pays up,
we kill the girl for him

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.314
but not before.

01:02:20.316 --> 01:02:23.448
No, he'll hire his best, hunt us down

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:24.905
and execute us.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.048
And for that reason, and that reason only,

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.088
this conversation never happened.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:29.993
Case closed.

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:32.558
Are you sure, man?

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.278
Everybody else is in.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.043
Look, I know Cosmo better
than everybody here, right?

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.212
Stick to the gameplan,
do exactly what he says.

01:02:42.214 --> 01:02:45.099
Catch up with Viveca, take her out,

01:02:45.101 --> 01:02:46.333
the money's good enough.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.913
All right, okay.

01:02:51.123 --> 01:02:53.934
I'll tell everybody let's forget about it.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.704
Good.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.768
Viveca, how are you?

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.658
It's good to see you, Isabella.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.308
You scared me on the phone.

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:22.728
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:25.128
I cannot wait to find
out what is going on.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:26.538
Are you all right?

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.638
No, but I am strong.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.698
Good for you.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.062
Let's go sit in the park and talk.

01:03:32.064 --> 01:03:35.938
Wow, Viveca, they are very nice.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.418
I want to be rich too.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.897
I will start my fashion company soon.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.288
I've been saving money to
start my first daycare center.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:47.908
I want to have a daycare center
in every city in America.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.258
More than 400 cities.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.091
Wow.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.408
But I still have a very
rough and long way to go

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:55.718
if I survive.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.958
And that brings me to why I asked you

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.338
to come out and meet me.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.268
I am holding my breath, Viveca.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.928
Because we're just coworkers who are sent

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:08.208
to clean office buildings
for 300 dollars a week.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.888
Well, you became an assistant to the boss.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.268
You say hi to me with a pleasant smile

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:15.068
and I say it back to you.

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:18.068
Sometimes, it's the other way around.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.618
I say it first.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:22.078
Sometimes you say more than that.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.608
You will say, smile, life
is too short, cheer up.

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:29.008
Yes, when you look sad.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.386
Half of the time you look sad.

01:04:31.388 --> 01:04:35.088
Isabella, I want you to know that

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:38.438
being nice to somebody
that you barely know

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.515
can save your life.

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:43.698
You're here now because
you were always nice to me.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.418
Well, not always.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.448
You had a couple of bad days.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.398
I called you a bitch once.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.448
But you know that I didn't mean it.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.658
I was having a really bad day.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.928
I know.

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:58.398
I also know a lot of things about you.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.718
Like what?

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.228
I know how you came to America.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.558
There's a powerful human trafficker.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.123
His name is Cosmo.

01:05:09.945 --> 01:05:11.395
Please, look at me, Isabella.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.761
I came the same way so we
have a few things in common.

01:05:18.763 --> 01:05:21.471
We are both illegal aliens, no papers.

01:05:21.473 --> 01:05:23.598
So what else is new?

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.308
What may be new to you is that

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.848
I saw documents for a
secret insurance policy

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:33.338
on your life for five million dollars.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.028
Life insurance, me?

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.577
That is impossible.

01:05:37.579 --> 01:05:39.515
My husband is dead.

01:05:39.517 --> 01:05:42.208
He died a long time ago in Colombia

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.408
before I came to this country.

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.508
I didn't say your husband.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.288
It's your employer.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:52.749
The man we both work for, that
bought the insurance policy.

01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:55.578
Duncan Enterprises.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.718
And has been secretly paying the premiums.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.668
Oh my god.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.968
This cannot be true.

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.398
Remember the Mexican guy you liked?

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.238
The handsome guy you
couldn't keep your hands off?

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.958
Francesco.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.968
He was very good to me.

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:14.428
Very obedient in my bedroom,
if you know what I mean.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:17.378
Too bad he died in that car accident.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.118
Isabella, he was murdered.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.998
The hit and run driver was never caught.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.318
And you might be next.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.768
Oh my god, two years
ago, the Jamaican woman.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.148
She had a heart attack and died.

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:35.758
And before that, a burglar
killed the old Haitian guy

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.248
with a knife and got away.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.808
There is more.

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.868
You don't need to tell me.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:43.458
I already know.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.878
Isabella, I need your help.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.628
In what way?

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.248
When you lived in Bogota, Colombia,

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:54.458
you helped the American
government in a big way.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.568
What are you talking about?

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.198
Please, don't pretend
that you don't know

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.428
what I'm talking about.

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.868
It could be our way out of this mess

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.143
before it's too late.

01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:07.178
I heard a small part of
a conversation about you.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.898
And I have to ask why you're still

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.138
an illegal alien in this country

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.378
after what you did in Bogota?

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.818
I lost contact with
a very important man.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.368
And after a while, I
stopped searching for him.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.021
I was not a spy for CIA.

01:07:23.023 --> 01:07:26.858
I saw something down below on the street

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.618
from my 12th floor apartment in Bogota.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.608
Kidnappers brought six
American missionaries

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:35.138
to a cartel safehouse across the street

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.583
from my apartment building.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.758
So I called the American
Embassy and told them

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.408
because I recognized the hostages.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.838
I already saw their
photographs several times

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.568
during news broadcasts
on Colombian television.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:50.348
That was very brave.

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:52.628
I was not trying to be brave.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.828
I just wanted to do the
right thing as a human being.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:08:00.248
Anyway, CIA sniper and
Colombian army sniper

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.998
used my apartment windows

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.188
to shoot and kill the kidnappers.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.988
when they killed one of
the American hostages.

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:10.808
The remaining five
missionaries were saved.

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.495
How did you feel?

01:08:12.497 --> 01:08:15.898
I cannot describe the good feeling.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.058
Especially since I was
offered a lot of money

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.718
to use my apartment.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.037
But I could not accept money

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.328
to save my fellow human being.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.707
Even though they were totally strangers.

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:28.648
My husband felt the same way.

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:31.787
Wow, Isabella, you are an angel.

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.848
I am not an angel.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:37.048
I just wanted to be a real human being.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:39.068
What happened next?

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:42.877
My husband and I worked
at a small bank in Bogota.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.837
And our two kids Sonya and Emilio

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.108
were in a private elementary school

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:49.408
not far from the bank.

01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:51.908
So we all leave together in the morning

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:54.207
in my husband's Range Rover.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:56.457
We will drop the kids off at school

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.877
and then go to work.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.598
One morning, seven days after
the kidnappers were killed,

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.207
we got in the Range Rover to
leave for work and school.

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:08.298
Me and my husband and kids.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.087
As my husband was about to start the jeep,

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.455
Sonya said "Mama, I forgot my homework.

01:09:14.457 --> 01:09:17.955
"I left it on the dining table
and it's due this morning.

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:20.728
"Can you go get it for me, please, mama?"

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:25.377
My Sonya was a bright, happy
and pretty 10 year old.

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.127
I got out of the jeep and
hurried back inside the building.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:32.055
Then I heard an explosion behind me

01:09:32.057 --> 01:09:35.228
that knocked me off my
feet and broke glasses

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:36.688
on the doors in the lobby.

01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:38.127
Oh no.

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:41.058
When I turned around on
the floor in the lobby,

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.768
I saw that the Range Rover
was covered in flames

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.308
on all sides.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.068
Its roof and windows had been blown away

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.898
and nothing was left inside.

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:52.358
It happened a long time ago

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.752
but it still haunts me.

01:09:54.753 --> 01:09:58.298
In part because CIA
offered to help my family

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.698
move and settle here in America.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.608
Isabella, I don't know what to say.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.886
There is so much wickedness.

01:10:06.888 --> 01:10:10.828
Obviously, you didn't take the offer.

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:14.271
The CIA man in charge
warned me and my husband

01:10:14.273 --> 01:10:17.457
that the cartel has promised revenge.

01:10:17.459 --> 01:10:20.698
But my husband didn't
want to leave Colombia.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.708
He had a lot of faith in God.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.308
He said God would never allow anything bad

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.358
to happen to us because we're good people

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.188
who did the right thing.

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:31.213
So I stayed.

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.848
Every day we pray to God to protect us

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.618
from evil people.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.928
I cannot explain why God allowed my family

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:40.925
to die like that.

01:10:40.927 --> 01:10:42.188
But I still have faith in God.

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.028
You got out of the jeep

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.128
just before it exploded.

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:47.258
You survived.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.431
And I think God had a hand in that.

01:10:50.433 --> 01:10:52.688
I also think that your daughter Sonya

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:57.028
who sent you to get her homework
just before the explosion

01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:59.569
was an angel sent by God.

01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:01.808
It could have been worse.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:04.527
But you're here and talking to me.

01:11:04.529 --> 01:11:07.469
Be thankful, I know I am.

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:11.728
Isabella, you and I have
more in common than you know.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:14.618
Please tell me what happened next.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.453
I ran.

01:11:16.431 --> 01:11:18.298
I left Colombia and went into hiding

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.208
in Caracas, Venezuela.

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:22.288
I was there for eight years

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:24.678
and it was a very tough life for me.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.998
Why didn't you go to
the CIA man in Colombia

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.888
since they had offered to help you?

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:33.953
I became a mad woman after the car bomb.

01:11:35.053 --> 01:11:37.425
I blamed Americans for losing my family.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.748
I did not want to have
anything to do with them.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.249
But it was a miscalculation
by a traumatized woman.

01:11:43.251 --> 01:11:45.243
And by the time that I realized

01:11:45.245 --> 01:11:46.076
that I should have taken the offer,

01:11:46.078 --> 01:11:48.228
it was already too late.

01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:51.448
When I called that number in
Bogota that he had given me,

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.531
I heard that the CIA man had retired

01:11:53.533 --> 01:11:56.728
and I could not get in touch with him.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.068
I am so sorry to hear that, Isabella.

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:01.408
Me too.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:04.538
The new officers of the
American Embassy in Bogota

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.371
didn't know me,

01:12:05.373 --> 01:12:08.848
nor the role that I had
played eight years earlier.

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.528
In Caracas, I could not
get a visa to America.

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.188
I was homeless, did not have a passport,

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:17.618
no relatives even because the cartel

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.858
had killed off my relatives.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.398
Within the first two years
before CIA and Colombian army

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.558
finished off that particular organization.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.358
So from Caracas, I came
to America as an illegal

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.238
to start a new life.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.818
Have you tried looking
for that retired CIA man

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.638
since you arrived?

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.938
Because even though he is retired,

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.748
I'm sure he can still help you

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:43.368
and maybe me too.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:47.253
Our lives may depend on
finding that man fast.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.488
I have tried.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.938
You see in Bogota, his
name was John, John Doe.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.031
I knew it was not his real name.

01:12:57.033 --> 01:13:00.365
Then one day last year,
I turn on my television

01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.538
and I saw him on the news.

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.268
He was talking about
terrorists as a consultant

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.068
to the television network.

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:08.818
I saw his real name.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.938
This is exciting,
Isabella, you found him, yes!

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.608
I know where he lives.

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:18.108
But I have been to ashamed
to approach him for help.

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:19.935
I don't understand.

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:21.550
Please, tell me why.

01:13:21.552 --> 01:13:25.208
When my husband refused
to leave Colombia,

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:27.748
Mr. Powers, Jeffrey Powers.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.458
That's his real name?

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.628
Yes.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.458
He wanted me to leave with my children.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.668
He pleaded with me to save my children

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:38.098
and myself by coming to America.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.398
Because CIA could not
protect us in Colombia.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.058
You could have done
it for your children.

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.498
Just because we have faith in God

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:50.098
does not mean it's okay to
put ourselves in danger.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.058
Because we might be doing so

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.948
when God is tired and taking a little nap.

01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:57.748
That's when bad things
happen to good people.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.978
I can never forgive myself.

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:03.678
Not forgiving yourself will
not change what has happened.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.948
Also something tells me that you may have

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:09.917
already been in contact with Mr. Powers

01:14:09.919 --> 01:14:12.568
but the meeting didn't go well.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:14.198
Is that so?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.943
Isabella, you can tell me the whole truth.

01:14:16.945 --> 01:14:19.668
We are in this together now.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.868
He was not happy to see me.

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.538
Said I wasted my children's lives.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:28.678
CIA had a private jet waiting
to fly us out of Colombia.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.848
They were ready to give my family

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:33.684
anything we wanted in America.

01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:35.948
My children would have
had the best education.

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:39.478
My husband and I would have
had better paying banking jobs.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.248
But I allowed my husband's
blind faith to ruin everything.

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.828
He threatened to call the police

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:47.678
if I come to his place again.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.618
Wow, that is very bad for me and you.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.858
I had a big hope just a few minutes ago.

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:58.088
A way out, a possible happy
ending to our troubles.

01:14:58.090 --> 01:14:59.208
And now?

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:01.828
I don't know what to tell you, Viveca.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.598
Bad luck follows me around.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.338
Bad judgment, not bad luck.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.818
And it's not following you around.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.678
The man has a right to be angry at you.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.788
But you have to take me to him right now

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.998
or we're all going to die.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.808
Let him call the police
after I've told him

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:20.188
everything I know.

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:23.188
He just might change his
mind and decide to help.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.085
Let's go, Isabella.

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.996
You are a
troublemaker, Viveca.

01:15:26.998 --> 01:15:28.598
I'm just desperate to survive.

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:33.368
Isabella, if anything happens to me,

01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:36.209
if I die before we get to Mr. Powers,

01:15:36.211 --> 01:15:39.458
promise me you're not gonna
change your mind and back out.

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.258
Because these bad people
we are dealing with

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.478
will kill you sooner or later.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.228
I promise, but I hope
nothing happens to you

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.292
because we're in this
together now, as you say.

01:15:50.294 --> 01:15:53.905
That man is your ticket to freedom.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.228
I just have a bad feeling
there is a car behind us.

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:11.858
It's been following us
since we left the marina.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.698
Are you sure it has been following us?

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.058
I am positive.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.808
I will try to lose him.

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:21.468
If that doesn't work, I
think we should separate

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:25.068
so that at least one of us will survive.

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:27.748
Are you sure you want to do that?

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.903
I think we have a
better chance that way.

01:16:38.751 --> 01:16:40.328
Hello?

01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:41.798
Hi, Viveca.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.371
Hello, Mr. Cosmo.

01:16:43.373 --> 01:16:46.778
Viveca, I have both
good news and bad news.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.038
The good news is that today's my birthday.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.218
So I'm in a better mood than usual.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.593
And what has that got to do with me?

01:16:53.595 --> 01:16:55.428
Everything, Viveca.

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:57.158
Rafer Duncan is dead.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.528
I killed him last night.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.508
And if you tell me who
you've been talking to,

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.848
except for Isabella Rodriguez
who is with you right now,

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.768
I will consider sparing your life.

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:07.734
Mr. Duncan is dead?

01:17:07.736 --> 01:17:10.798
As a businessman, I
did what I had to do.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.148
And I'll continue the
housecleaning until I feel safe.

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:16.318
How did you know Isabella is with me?

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.668
You're being followed
by my men right now.

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:20.648
They tracked you down a few minutes ago.

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:22.052
How?

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.471
Can't tell you.

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:24.588
Answer my question right now

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:26.888
or you and Isabella will die in an ambush

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:29.078
the moment I hang up this phone.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.482
Why would you want to kill Isabella?

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.998
Because you've been running your mouth

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.788
scaring her for no reason.

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:38.588
If it wasn't for me, you
two wouldn't be in America

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:40.338
eating happy meals.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.158
Other traffickers would
have kept you in brothels,

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.788
got you hooked on drugs
and forced you to have sex

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:51.038
with 50 or 70 men and
women every single week.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.038
Wow, Mr. Cosmo, so this
is the better option?

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.538
Killing illegal aliens
for life insurance scam?

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.008
I don't know about
others but Isabella and I

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.528
have lost everything.

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:05.248
But we are still full
of hope and want to be

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:08.278
very productive in this great country.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.860
But not by having sex with
2,000 men and women every year.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:17.448
That gives a whole new
meaning to being productive.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.588
We don't want to be murdered

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:20.558
for life insurance money either.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.488
Can you understand that, Mr. Cosmo?

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:26.168
Viveca, your situation is not unique.

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:30.768
A man wiped out three
generations of my entire family

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:35.000
in one night for only 100 dollars.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:38.158
I even gave him a tip without knowing

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.750
I was paying him to kill my family.

01:18:41.752 --> 01:18:45.364
And that's how cruel some of
my fellow human beings can be.

01:18:45.366 --> 01:18:48.018
And that's why I don't care
how many people I kill or hurt.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.648
Your time is up, Viveca.

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.818
You just ruined my birthday.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:54.948
Mr. Cosmo, you are one very sick man

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:57.348
who belongs in a mental hospital.

01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:00.608
You too are probably
damaged beyond repair.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.538
I hope the police catches up
with you sooner than later

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.494
and put you out of business.

01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:07.598
You wish.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.118
Goodbye, Viveca.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.928
This is it, Isabella,
we have to separate now.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.718
Do you want the address again?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.178
Mr. Powers' address?

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.896
I already memorized it.

01:19:36.288 --> 01:19:37.690
Go, go, go!

01:19:37.692 --> 01:19:38.775
Be careful.

01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:06.718
Don't even think about it!

01:20:15.794 --> 01:20:17.980
Alfredo, you're gonna die right now.

01:20:17.982 --> 01:20:20.328
Cosmo, please!

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:22.268
Have mercy on me!

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:25.273
I will never steal from
you again, I promise you.

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:28.363
The devil made me do it.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.928
Aglas, seems like the devil's

01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:32.786
been working overtime lately.

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:36.538
Tell you what, Alfredo.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.718
Since today is my birthday, even though

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.108
I don't celebrate it because
it reminds me of my family,

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:46.144
I will give you an
opportunity to save yourself.

01:20:46.146 --> 01:20:48.578
Answer one question for me

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:52.578
and if I like your answer,
I will forgive you.

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:53.808
Thank you, Cosmo.

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.488
Don't thank me yet because

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:57.678
it's not an easy one to answer.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.488
I have spent most of my adult life

01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.478
searching for the right answer.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.708
So please tell me, Alfredo.

01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:07.138
Why do some good people turn bad

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.328
after going through some
very traumatic events

01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:12.908
while others seem to keep their sanity

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.518
and move on to live honorable lives?

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.398
My best friend Emilio had it worse than me

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.488
and yet, he turned out okay.

01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:22.968
He became a judge.

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.838
Please, tell me why.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.253
Your life depends on it.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.263
Oh my god.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.648
Papi, can I give more than one answer?

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:36.198
No.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.120
One answer only. Wrong
answer and you're dead.

01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:41.918
Please, Cosmo.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.588
I cannot answer.

01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:46.328
I don't know, nobody knows.

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.968
Please, have mercy.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:48.801
Then you die.

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:51.203
Wait, wait, we're born that way.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:56.408
There's some are born
with the gift to sing

01:21:56.410 --> 01:21:59.338
or to see the future.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.743
Or to see what others do not
see in a piece of artwork.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.028
Or the strength to keep standing

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:12.163
when others are tired and
have fallen.

01:22:15.122 --> 01:22:18.983
It's something that
cannot be bought or sold.

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:25.323
It is god-given but only to a chosen few.

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.673
You can kill me now, Cosmo.

01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:39.773
Don't ever steal from me again.

01:22:41.066 --> 01:22:41.966
Aglas, let him go.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.985
Thank you, Cosmo.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.938
Hello?

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.088
Hey, Cosmo.

01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:54.668
It's Speedy, we got Viveca.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.288
What do you mean you have Viveca?

01:22:56.290 --> 01:22:58.478
She's supposed to be dead by now, Speedy.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.085
Put Jasper on the phone right now.

01:23:00.087 --> 01:23:03.398
I'm the one calling
the shots now, Cosmo.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.148
Jasper's asleep somewhere.

01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:07.998
On second thought, I
should have killed his ass.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.298
I don't like what I'm hearing.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.608
What's going on?

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.454
Change of plans, Cosmo.

01:23:12.456 --> 01:23:14.848
Bring two million dollars in large bills

01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:16.133
to the warehouse by,

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.158
three o'clock, that's in about two hours.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.968
We take the money, shoot
the girl in the head.

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.338
Fair enough?

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.202
Speedy, how can you
turn on me like this?

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:34.204
It wasn't my idea, Cosmo.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:39.058
Some of the crew came up to
me and made a suggestion.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.386
It was a sound idea.

01:23:42.388 --> 01:23:44.538
So I embraced it.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.128
I see.

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:47.328
Okay.

01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:49.238
Two million dollars.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.268
I'll see you guys at three o'clock.

01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:54.425
You're a little too
cool about this, Cosmo.

01:23:54.427 --> 01:23:57.389
Look, we're all just trying
to look out for ourselves

01:23:57.391 --> 01:23:59.076
since you're about ready to shut down.

01:23:59.078 --> 01:24:03.668
Nobody else has to die besides Viveca.

01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:04.968
Okay.

01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:06.683
I gotta go now, bye.

01:24:14.303 --> 01:24:15.828
Please understand this is not personal.

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:17.428
It's strictly business.

01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:20.108
We're expecting a large sum
of money to be delivered

01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:21.528
any moment now.

01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:24.888
And once the transaction is
concluded, we'll let you go.

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:27.528
You are lying, you are going to kill me.

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:30.218
You're extremely valuable to us, Viveca.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.408
No, we're not going to kill you.

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.648
We'll do whatever it
takes to keep you alive.

01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:36.633
Until you get the money, right?

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.867
You are not going to heaven when you die!

01:24:41.869 --> 01:24:46.752
Heaven?

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.198
I prefer Miami.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.200
Beautiful women, fresh
mojitos, the nightlife.

01:24:55.611 --> 01:24:57.411
Who needs heaven when you got Miami?

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.568
Hello, Miss.

01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:06.088
Hi?

01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:07.680
Do you live here?

01:25:07.682 --> 01:25:10.428
Yeah, can I help you?

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:11.808
I hope so.

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:15.083
Please, can I speak with
Mr. Powers, Jeffrey Powers?

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.337
Mr. Powers is dead.

01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:19.708
What?

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:21.360
He died a couple of months ago.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:23.733
Oh my god.

01:25:23.735 --> 01:25:25.018
He suffered a stroke.

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.588
I'm so sorry to hear that.

01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:28.128
He was a very good man.

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.783
I'm so sorry.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.627
Thank you for your sympathy.

01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:35.858
At least he's not suffering anymore.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.688
Are you his daughter?

01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:39.598
Yes, I'm his youngest.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.858
I am Isabella Rodriguez.

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.261
I'm Janice.

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:46.988
Miss Powers, I am here
because my very close friend

01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:48.665
and I are in big trouble

01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:51.498
and we were hoping that
your father might help us.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.975
He was our only hope.

01:25:52.977 --> 01:25:55.078
What kind of trouble are you in?

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.525
We are victims of human trafficking

01:25:57.527 --> 01:25:59.768
for a life insurance scam.

01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.008
Some bad people are after us.

01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:04.048
They have killed some of our friends.

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.538
But we cannot go to the police

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.358
because we don't have our papers.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.008
Isabella, you're the lady from Colombia.

01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.841
Yes miss.

01:26:10.843 --> 01:26:12.958
Please cut out the Miss.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.008
Thank you for your help in Bogota.

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.698
My father told me about you.

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:17.531
Really?

01:26:17.533 --> 01:26:18.366
Yes.

01:26:19.497 --> 01:26:20.899
You're quite brave.

01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:22.728
And he wished that he wasn't
so harsh the last time you came

01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:24.978
but he instructed me to make
some calls on your behalf

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:26.088
if you showed up again.

01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.178
Oh my god.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.548
I can't believe this.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.992
Oh my god.

01:26:29.994 --> 01:26:33.028
Wait till you
speak to his former boss.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:35.268
The station Chief in Bogota at the time,

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:38.098
he's now President of the United States

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.468
and his son Michael was among the hostages

01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:41.928
that you helped rescue.

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:45.089
Your problems just flew
out the window, Isabella.

01:26:45.091 --> 01:26:48.068
I have to tell you
about my friend, Viveca.

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:50.868
She may be in grave danger
as we speak right now.

01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:51.978
Come inside the house,

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.728
tell me all about your friend Viveca

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:55.478
and I'll start making some phone calls.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.155
Sure, god bless you.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:26:59.600
You're welcome.

01:27:07.062 --> 01:27:07.893
Help, somebody help me!

01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:08.726
What the hell?

01:27:08.728 --> 01:27:10.255
Somebody help me please!

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:16.868
Help, somebody help me please!

01:27:24.279 --> 01:27:26.013
Keep your head down.

01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:55.868
Viveca, I owe you a big explanation.

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.458
I've been waiting to hear it.

01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.878
At first, I was gonna kill you

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.918
'cause Cosmo gave the order.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.228
Plus a big payday.

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.552
So what made you change your mind?

01:28:05.554 --> 01:28:08.928
I was pistol whipped by
Speedy and knocked out.

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.658
When I regained
consciousness I had a minute

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.105
to think clearly.

01:28:12.107 --> 01:28:14.208
And I realized that the
house that Cosmo built

01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.888
is falling apart.

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:17.760
If the police catch up with me,

01:28:17.762 --> 01:28:22.288
maybe, just maybe, I'd get
a shorter jail sentence,

01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:23.388
if I came up to the warehouse

01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:26.578
and got you out of harm's
way before it was too late.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.558
Well thank you very much, Jasper.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.812
You're welcome.

01:28:30.814 --> 01:28:33.688
What are you going to do now?

01:28:33.690 --> 01:28:35.208
I'm gonna run like hell.

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:37.618
From Cosmo and the cops.

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.188
What about you?

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:41.978
I'm gonna find out if
God has chosen an angel

01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.688
to save me and my new friend Isabella.

01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:46.108
I hope so for your sake

01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:48.418
'cause Cosmo will hunt you down.

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.188
I will be better prepared just in case.

01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:53.376
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

01:28:53.378 --> 01:28:57.088
That's a long story
and we don't have time.

01:28:57.090 --> 01:28:59.888
You can stop the car now, I have to go.

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:00.723
Sure.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.428
Take care, Viveca.

01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:07.718
You too, bye bye.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.553
Bye.

01:29:20.475 --> 01:29:21.485
Hello?

01:29:21.487 --> 01:29:23.628
Viveca, are you okay?

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:24.968
Yeah, Isabella.

01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:26.761
Did you talk to Mr. Powers?

01:29:26.763 --> 01:29:29.007
Mr. Powers is dead.

01:29:29.009 --> 01:29:30.665
Oh my god.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:33.748
Then why are you so excited?

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:36.509
Because we have very
powerful friends now

01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:37.967
who are going to help us.

01:29:37.969 --> 01:29:39.868
Who, the CIA?

01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:42.658
And the President of the United States.

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.308
I am feeling so intoxicated right now

01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:47.588
even though I haven't had a drink yet.

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:49.998
Come on to Mr. Powers' home quickly.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.488
His daughter cannot
wait to speak with you.

01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:56.018
Cosmo is going to be out of
business in the next hour.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.998
Oh my god, I'm so happy right now.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.140
On my way, bye.

01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:13.251
