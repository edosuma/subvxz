00:18.680 --> 00:20.520
You going?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.600
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Won't be a sec.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.920
Just so you know,
these spots are reserved for parents.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.240
Yeah, I have a baby.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.760
With prams. Parents with prams.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.360
See the sign with the little wheels?
That's a pram.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.040
No, that's the universal symbol
for parents.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.760
No, the pram is the symbol for a pram.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.640
I do have a pram in there somewhere.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.320
Yes, but you're not using it.
You're using a carrier.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.920
You don't have a pram,
so you can't park here.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.800
OK. What about disabled parking?

00:49.880 --> 00:52.320
You don't have to have a wheelchair
to be disabled, do you?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.080
You can be very disabled
and not have a wheelchair.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.760
My mother had her knees done -
didn't even have crutches.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.520
Got one of those stickers,
held onto it for months.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.880
Just move your car, please!

01:00.960 --> 01:02.000
Yep.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.720
-Actually, I'm not going now.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.320
Yeah, I think I need to go to the chemist.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.760
Oh, get fudged!

01:10.840 --> 01:13.880
Just swear. The word's 'fuck'!

01:13.960 --> 01:15.840
Sorry. Sorry, darling.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.920
But she was an arsehole.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.200
Oh, Jesus...

01:34.680 --> 01:37.760
Ow! Oh, god!

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
You stupid...

01:42.760 --> 01:46.280
Come on. Oh, you piece of shit!

01:46.360 --> 01:48.320
Not you, darling. Sorry. Good morning.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.640
Oh, good morning.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Oh.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.280
OK.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.840
Ooh! Ooh, goodness!

01:58.920 --> 02:00.240
-Oh, jeez!
-Ooh!

02:00.320 --> 02:02.360
Oh, this pram! I swear!

02:02.440 --> 02:06.560
Oh. Ooh, it looks like it's missing
the safety clip on the brake there.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.919
What? I don't think so.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.840
Yeah, I heard these Indonesian copies...

02:10.919 --> 02:12.120
No, this is Danish.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.280
Oh. Sorry, my mistake.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.160
All good. You're OK, darling. You're OK.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.640
Alrighty. Let's go.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.240
Yes let's go to... Come on.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.520
Whoopsies.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.200
Ow.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.480
Tizzie.<i> Save Our Sleep.</i> It's great.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.360
Saved our sex life.
Saved our marriage.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.600
I cannot recommend it enough, this one.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.520
Hmm. Uh, Ester.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.800
Well, Ruben wanted me to bring in
his favourite,<i> Baby Love,</i>

02:38.880 --> 02:42.200
but I also brought in my favourite -
<i>The Woman's Working Handbook.</i>

02:42.280 --> 02:44.960
Which is great, 'cause, you know,
it really helped us work out our routine.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.080
I let Ruben think that it's his routine.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.680
And what about
our new mum, Georgia?

02:48.760 --> 02:50.800
-Yeah, I did.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.480
So, I co-slept with my parents for...
ages, really.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.840
But, um, this is my co-sleeping manual.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.720
Oh, did you know
93% of parents co

03:00.800 --> 03:04.160
Yes, thanks, Georgia,
but let's not pretend there are no risks -

03:04.240 --> 03:05.840
like smothering.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.160
Yes. I love this.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.480
It's all about the brain

03:11.560 --> 03:15.480
and it shows the different stages
of development.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.720
Hmm. How about that. Sophie?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.360
Um...

03:20.440 --> 03:22.520
Why don't you just pick your favourite?

03:22.600 --> 03:26.120
They're all great, but my favourite's
actually an app

03:26.200 --> 03:27.240
Yes.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.760
Um, Track My Baby
keeps track of everything

03:29.840 --> 03:34.240
and helps me to organise all of Ziggy's
key moments so I can easily share them.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.800
Plus it has the most amazing
baby photo filters.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.680
I cannot take a bad photo.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.360
Take one of us.
-Alright.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.920
Show me.
-No, that's a bad example.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.080
-Yeah, no, don't post that.
-I'm not going to.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.760
-God, that'll ruin your perfect feed.
-Yeah, I know!

03:49.840 --> 03:52.480
Audrey

03:53.280 --> 03:54.680
Did you read the email?

03:57.040 --> 04:01.440
Subject
Yes. I read that bit.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.280
Did you read the body of the email?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.320
May not have read the body of it.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.760
Right.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.120
Um, but it's not entirely off topic.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.040
It's a cautionary tale about
creating a monster, so...

04:13.120 --> 04:15.800
I actually marked a bit for us.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.120
Um, yeah, listen to this.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.160
"By the dim and yellow light of the moon,

04:21.240 --> 04:24.920
I beheld the wretch - the miserable
monster whom I had created."

04:25.000 --> 04:26.960
It's funny.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.040
It's beautiful prose.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.480
I'm sorry. I'm very tired.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.320
I've been doing a lot of night driving.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.200
Stevie seems to think we live
in the Northern Hemisphere.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.520
But I highly recommend this,

04:39.600 --> 04:42.720
uh, to anyone who wants to read
something other than the parenting--

04:42.800 --> 04:44.760
Any other babies with day

04:44.840 --> 04:46.520
-Nup.
-Um, no.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.200
-No.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.440
And what does Mary Shelley
have to say about sleeping patterns?

04:52.520 --> 04:54.680
Uh, very little.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.360
Yeah, the monster doesn't
really sleep in the book.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.160
Just like mine.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.080
These are really good with sleep.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.320
You are welcome to borrow any of them.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.880
Yeah, reference books just
kind of take me back to exams

05:05.960 --> 05:08.280
and my Year 12 addiction to Sudafed
and instant coffee.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.840
I prefer fiction.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.640
Well, you might want to try
something other than 19th-century gothic

05:12.720 --> 05:15.080
if you want to break the driving habit.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.320
Uh, Sophie, lend her
one of your sleep books, will you?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.400
Look, it's fine. They're a bit self-helpy.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.080
Thanks, but I don't need the books.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.360
Can I help you with anything?

05:28.440 --> 05:31.640
Uh, anything you can recommend?

05:31.720 --> 05:35.240
Uh, depends on your style.
What are you, attachment?

05:35.320 --> 05:36.440
No.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.280
Crummy mummy? It's very hot right now.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.520
Free Helicopter

05:43.600 --> 05:44.960
Wha... SMUM?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.200
Smart, Middle-class, Uninvolved Mum.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.240
Well, I'm smart-ish.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.000
Who comes up with this stuff?

05:51.080 --> 05:53.880
Tiger Mums there,
French stuff is there.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.200
-Ooh, that sounds like me.
-But I think they smack.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.720
Do they? No.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.200
Hmm... what is it specifically
you're looking for?

06:00.280 --> 06:03.840
Uh, sleep. Anything to do with
sleep or routine.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.240
Whoa!

06:06.320 --> 06:07.800
Got any crib notes for that?

06:07.880 --> 06:08.960
You mean cheat sheets?

06:09.040 --> 06:13.480
Well, perfectly acceptable form
of exam prep in my day. But, um...

06:13.560 --> 06:16.760
Hang on.
I might have something. Hang on.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.080
Oh, great. Audrey!

06:22.360 --> 06:24.000
-Hi!
-Hi!

06:24.080 --> 06:25.520
You're getting some non

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
-No.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.480
No, just getting a bit of, um, the...

06:29.560 --> 06:30.880
Gay and lesbian erotica?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.640
-Yes. I love it.
-Oh. Oh!

06:32.720 --> 06:33.920
You

06:34.000 --> 06:36.160
I'm looking for Georgia's book.
I don't have that one.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.240
-Right.
-Yeah.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.400
Here it is.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.840
Uh, no, I don't think... That's not...

06:44.040 --> 06:46.160
Go away, please.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.920
-No.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.360
Borrow my books. Don't waste your money.
They're in my car.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.600
No, you'll need them.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.840
No, I won't.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.240
-Well, you might.
-He's sleeping through.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.360
-Yeah.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.640
Oh, you mean, like, 11:00 to 5:00,
or something? That's not really...

07:06.720 --> 07:08.640
-No, like, 7:00 till 7:00, every night.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.600
-Yeah, I know! Amazing.
-Yeah, it is.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.840
Well she's the same.
Just the... other way round.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.840
-Yeah.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.960
Um, well... sure.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.560
Yeah, may as well give it a go.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.120
-Great.
-Thank you.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.840
Ooh, did you want to get your erotica?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.520
No, I've got heaps. That's...

07:25.600 --> 07:27.440
-Oh, OK.
-...fine, thanks.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.880
"Divide your day
into five-minute intervals."

07:34.640 --> 07:36.320
<i>-No. Nothing.</i>

07:36.400 --> 07:37.800
<i>Hi. Hey, um,</i>

07:37.880 --> 07:41.240
there's no chance that our pram
is a knock

07:42.360 --> 07:45.000
Um... no.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.560
Well, it's got a missing part.
We'll need to get it fixed.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.760
<i>Really?</i>

07:48.840 --> 07:50.840
That's bad. I'll, um... I'll sort it, OK?

07:50.920 --> 07:52.960
<i>Great. Oh, can you get some</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:54.280
instant coffee on your way home?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.240
-A fancy one.
<i>-Yep.</i>

07:56.320 --> 07:58.240
Excellent. OK. Love you. Bye.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.840
Alright. Bye.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Fuck.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.360
"Do not buy from this guy."

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
"Everything he sells is fake."

08:11.520 --> 08:14.440
Guspop3, you piece of shit!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.040
Sorry.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.920
Hi. Why are you sitting in the dark?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.120
Huh?

08:27.200 --> 08:29.160
And why is there foil
on the nursery window?

08:29.240 --> 08:32.120
-It looks a bit like a crack den.
-Well, it blocks out the light.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.760
-Sophie from mothers' group.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.080
Oh, she's not supposed to be up!

08:37.159 --> 08:39.159
But she was crying
and I haven't seen her all day.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.679
Don't make eye contact!
You'll overstimulate. Turn your head.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.159
-Turn your head!
 What's all this?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.440
It's controlled crying -
it's a sleep-training thing.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.000
We're gonna start leaving her in the cot.
We let her cry, we go in at intervals.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.920
Not 35-second ones. Read this.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, are you sure that's a good idea
after the natural childbirth stuff?

08:55.080 --> 08:57.760
I mean, didn't you say these parenting
books were all self

08:57.840 --> 09:00.600
Yeah, I did say that,
but she's failing mothers' group.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.040
She's the best looking
but she is the worst one there.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.200
Oh, who cares? I mean,
it's not a competition.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.840
Yeah. That's what losers say.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.920
Look at us, doing a routine! I'm excited.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
Hey.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.720
-Controlled crying.
-Controlled crying.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.800
Yeah, good.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.720
-Night.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.760
Love you.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.040
Good luck.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.760
Thanks, sweetheart. So, two minutes,
four minutes, six minutes.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.800
Yep. That's it.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.000
-I've got the thing.
-Good.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.520
I'm... I'm good.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.080
-Come on. Go.
-OK.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.400
Alright.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.480
So, two minutes.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.000
Yep. Then I go in
and pat her till she's asleep.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
So you pat...
It's not two minutes patting?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.480
-No, two minutes crying.
-Yep. Cool.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.800
Go, go, go.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.320
Two minutes.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.360
-Good luck.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.520
Oh, nice one!

10:26.600 --> 10:28.160
Why didn't we do that weeks ago?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.760
OK. So we're doing it
straight away, again?

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
Yeah.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.760
-No, four.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.120
We've only just come back from a two.
This is the first--

10:42.200 --> 10:44.440
-This is the second time. It's important.
-Yes and it's...

10:44.520 --> 10:46.600
It's four minutes.
I'm the one who read the book.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.960
Oh, did you read the book?

10:48.040 --> 10:49.920
You haven't mentioned that
for two minutes.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.440
-I'm sorry.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.680
Look, I'll start now. Sorry.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.240
That's been at least two minutes!

10:58.320 --> 10:59.640
-It's not. Like...
-Oh, shit!

10:59.720 --> 11:01.760
-I get--
-I'm just going in. That is way too long.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.840
Well, you're gonna waste your turn,
aren't you?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.120
What are you doing?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.200
Were you sleeping?

11:11.560 --> 11:14.960
I've... I've got fucking RSI
and you're out here sleeping?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.760
I'm sorry.
-Well, you can pat next.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.280
Why am I doing all the patting?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.280
-Oh, fuck it!

11:27.360 --> 11:29.440
-I just missed the...

11:29.520 --> 11:32.040
-I nearly had her fucking asleep!
-Yeah.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.000
-Oh, fuck. Turn it off!

11:35.800 --> 11:36.880
Alright.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.440
-Six minutes.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.280
-Six minutes.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.600
Gonna have a lie-down for five and a half.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.000
Uh, I don't think so.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.080
I know it sucks. Aud, Aud. No.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.200
-I can't. I can't.
-We said six.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.440
You said six and I said I'd stop.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.760
I said I'd stop. Please don't.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.600
Shut up! Just get my keys!
I'll drive her to sleep.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.200
OK. I'll get your keys.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.560
Morning, darling.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.080
D'you, uh, want to come inside?

12:41.160 --> 12:45.280
We have, uh, fresh water,
full bathroom facilities...

12:45.360 --> 12:47.120
Five more minutes. Just...

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
OK.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.200
I'll get you a coffee.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.200
Oh. Another flawless photoshoot.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.560
Is it Sophie?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.720
It's like she gets her hair done
before bed.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.040
Oh, yeah? It's alright.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.040
Oh, fuck, no! Please!

13:19.080 --> 13:21.280
Maybe we should quit
and just bring her into our bed tonight.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.920
Yes! I'm exhausted. Thank you!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.400
OK. That was a test and you just failed.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.720
You're testing me now?
-Yep.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.640
Because last night was a disaster.
We have to do better.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.680
-No!
-And by 'we', I mean <i> you!</i>

13:33.760 --> 13:35.960
But you started crying
at the five-minute mark.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.080
Yeah, I can't control that!
I've got the crazy hormones!

13:39.160 --> 13:41.760
I think I'm the only one
that wasn't crying, OK?

13:41.840 --> 13:44.600
Can you just hide my car keys,
or disconnect the engine or something?

13:44.680 --> 13:47.360
-We're doing it!
-Alright. Righto.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.720
So, where do we start, six minutes?

13:49.800 --> 13:51.400
-No, we go back to two.
-No!

13:51.480 --> 13:53.440
Last night doesn't count.
We have to reset.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.720
Actually, maybe we should do
the tougher version. Five-minute intervals.
No touching. Shushing only.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.840
-Water.
 I need water.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.200
I'm very parched.
I've been shushing for hours.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.200
-Rightio. I'll get you a drink.
-Yeah.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.520
Oh! Jeez!

14:17.600 --> 14:22.640
Oh, my god! I have been in there
for an hour with her...

14:22.720 --> 14:24.640
I'm sorry! My leg went to sleep.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.360
Oh!

14:26.440 --> 14:28.720
No, no, no. You said ten minutes.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.400
That was your fault! Like the pram!

14:31.480 --> 14:34.000
What has the pram got to do
with sleep training?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.760
They're disappointments
that are mostly your fault.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.720
-Let me in.
-Oh, just...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.880
I bought the pram on eBay.

14:54.960 --> 14:55.960
What?

14:56.040 --> 14:59.000
I bought the pram on eBay.
There's every chance it's a fake.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.320
But you bought that fake handbag
and you loved that.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.360
That was a functional tote!
It had all those pockets.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.520
Your fake could have killed her!

15:09.600 --> 15:11.600
OK. I'm going. I'm going.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.240
<i> Hello, Gene speaking.</i>

15:21.320 --> 15:22.680
Hi, Dad. Is Mum there?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.920
<i>Oh, yeah. Just a sec.</i>

15:25.000 --> 15:27.080
<i> I'm here, darling. How are you?</i>

15:27.160 --> 15:28.680
Yeah, not good, Mum.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.920
Not good. I'm really shattered.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.120
<i>Oh, darling!</i>

15:32.200 --> 15:35.400
Did you guys ever do that
controlled crying
<i>No. Just let her cry it out.</i>

15:38.760 --> 15:41.600
I mean, I just need a break.
I mean, we both do. You know?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.040
<i>Well, what about Verity</i>

15:44.120 --> 15:46.040
Verity is useless! She's, like...

15:46.120 --> 15:50.560
Her advice would be, "Oh, go to a day spa.
Relax! Go to a hotel sometime!"

15:50.640 --> 15:52.440
Like, her advice is fucking useless.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.400
I don't even understand why I even...

15:54.480 --> 15:56.200
I'm sorry, Mum. I shouldn't have sworn.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.680
How are you?

15:57.760 --> 16:00.200
<i>Oh, well...</i>
<i>your Aunt Bess died last night.</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:02.360
That's no good.
<i>-I know.</i>

16:02.440 --> 16:03.600
Anyway, I'd better go.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.800
<i>Oh, OK. OK, love. Bye, darling.</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:14.880
Oh.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.280
-Sophie.
<i>-Hi! Audrey!</i>

16:18.360 --> 16:20.240
-Really good.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.480
Really good.
Yeah, I think we've broken her in.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.720
<i>Oh, amazing!</i>

16:23.800 --> 16:25.600
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>for a social outing tomorrow?</i>

16:25.680 --> 16:27.600
What am I doing
for a social outing tomorrow?

16:27.680 --> 16:32.720
I am going, uh, to Toddler Time
at the library, I think.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.560
Or I... I might take her to the park.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.800
'Cause, I mean,
there are other kids there, so...

16:38.880 --> 16:40.600
that might... do it.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.640
<i>Do you want to come to</i>
<i>the mums and bubs movie?</i>

16:42.720 --> 16:44.240
-Yes, I do.
<i>-Great!</i>

16:44.320 --> 16:46.280
<i>Ruben and Barb are coming too.</i>

16:46.360 --> 16:47.920
<i>I haven't checked what the film is,</i>

16:48.000 --> 16:50.920
<i>but Ruben says they are always rom-coms.</i>

16:51.000 --> 16:52.560
<i>He goes every week and he loves it.</i>

16:52.640 --> 16:55.080
<i>♪ Instantly crazy ♪</i>

16:55.160 --> 16:57.560
<i>♪ We can go today ♪</i>

16:57.640 --> 17:00.160
<i>♪ We can go tomorrow... ♪</i>

17:22.358 --> 17:24.280
Where'd you return it to, Indonesia?

17:24.358 --> 17:26.440
-Pretty much.
-Well, I hope you got your money back.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.280
What are they?

17:30.360 --> 17:31.880
Noise-cancelling.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.000
Perfect. No pram. Headphones!

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
Nice work.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.080
Why can't we have her here,
in our bed?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.200
You said 93% of Asians co-sleep.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.160
Have you got a death

17:55.240 --> 17:56.880
Do you want to read about the risks?

17:59.880 --> 18:02.400
-Look.
-OK. "Sleep training..."

18:04.000 --> 18:06.040
"Protecting against developmental delay"?
That one?

18:06.120 --> 18:09.120
-No, not that one! Just...

18:13.640 --> 18:15.160
Oh, god!

18:15.240 --> 18:16.520
I am useless.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.880
I'm, like, seriously bad at this.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.320
I think... maybe I peaked when I was 13.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.480
I was really popular, I was... you know,
I won the history and the English medal,

18:30.560 --> 18:33.440
I had a job at the Hard Rock Cafe.
That was the height for me.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.920
Oh, don't be stupid!
I... Look, OK.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.640
I think the crying-it-out version
might still work.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.600
How can I possibly do that version
when I can't do the old version?

18:47.320 --> 18:51.200
I can't do anything right. I...
I never have baby wipes on me...

18:51.280 --> 18:52.920
Oh, come... Look, just hang on. Hang on.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.120
If we're honest,
she's being the dickhead now.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.240
Not us.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.680
-Don't call her a dickhead!
-I shouldn't have called her a dickhead.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.640
-We're the ones who--
-I'm angry, I'm...

19:01.960 --> 19:03.440
She's not a dickhead.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.520
Sorry.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.320
You know what I told Sophie?

19:08.400 --> 19:13.280
I told Sophie that she slept
from 8pm to 6am.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.200
Just... Just bold lies.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.480
I said that we had social time and it was
just me on social media for an hour.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.680
She's meant to be crying it out, not you.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.000
I'm a horrible person.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.240
You're not a horrible person.

19:27.320 --> 19:30.480
I bought a fake pram without brakes,

19:30.560 --> 19:32.960
that when I tried to return it,
I got headphones.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.520
Yeah, well... well, I am stunting her
development! Did you read that?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.080
-I think I'm worse.
-Well, we've both done some things.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.760
I'm probably worse than you.
I mean, most...

19:45.040 --> 19:46.760
I should have told you this before.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.280
During the birth, when things were
really, really grim, I...

19:54.080 --> 19:55.080
What?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.960
I promised God

20:00.040 --> 20:02.200
that I would baptise Stevie

20:02.280 --> 20:04.040
if he made everything OK.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.360
And I haven't done it.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.960
-And he might get--
-Or she.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.480
...or she might get mad.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.360
-Yes.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.800
I should do it.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.120
OK. I'm done.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.320
We don't believe in God.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.640
It's hard to shake.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.480
Also, that watch I bought you
for Christmas is fake.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.560
Any thoughts on that?
Nuh. Didn't think so.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.280
We did it! We...

20:50.360 --> 20:52.920
-Oh, shit!

20:53.000 --> 20:54.800
-Oh, sorry. Sorry!

21:03.560 --> 21:05.120
What is that smell?

21:08.480 --> 21:10.560
Is that mum eating pad thai?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.000
What's wrong with that?

21:14.080 --> 21:17.600
Well, it's just an unspoken cinema rule -
the only smell should be popcorn.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.240
And choc-tops.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.000
-It's 'cause there's no airflow.
-Absolutely.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.680
So entitled!

21:26.440 --> 21:27.680
Check the creepy guy.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.560
Why would you come to this session?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.760
He's probably a tight-arse.
You know, tickets are cheaper, right?

21:35.840 --> 21:37.560
Oh, gross!

21:37.640 --> 21:39.280
That is so creepy.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.920
Did you know that 5% of the
general population are paedophiles?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.440
Really?
-Yeah.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.320
-That's a lot!
-Yeah.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.800
I don't think he's here for the babies,
though. He's here for them.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.160
Boobs.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.840
Yeah. Yeah, if you were a guy
with a lactating fetish,

21:52.920 --> 21:54.320
this'd be the place to be.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.840
Absolutely. Yep. Think I just caught him.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.080
This is not OK. Audrey, you cover up.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.920
Not... right now.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.320
Ruben, is that
that guy from <i> Magic Mike?</i>

22:10.400 --> 22:12.360
-Don't know.
-No, that one.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.680
<i>-Magic Mike.</i>
 I don't know.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Yeah, it is.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.160
-Yeah.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.280
Oh, that... that was great!

22:26.360 --> 22:27.840
-Amazing.
-Oh!

22:27.920 --> 22:30.400
-Yeah. That was the whole point of it.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.280
-I had no idea.
-I made a complaint.

22:32.360 --> 22:33.840
About pad thai mum? Good!

22:33.920 --> 22:35.800
No! Him.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.920
What?

22:39.200 --> 22:41.360
I don't know if he was
actually looking at me.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.640
Well, why is he here?

22:42.720 --> 22:46.360
Did you know that one in four women
will suffer some form of sexual assault?

22:46.440 --> 22:48.840
If you include Stevie,
that could be one of us.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.960
I don't think statistics work like that.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
Well, his mo isn't helping him out.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.400
Nor are those shorts.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.000
-Mmm.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.360
-That's weird.
-It is weird.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.160
Children are attracted to moustaches.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.040
Yeah. Well, they're drawn to them.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.320
My kids hate it when Neale
grows a moustache. Hates it.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.360
I wonder what the ratio is
of paedo to mo?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.720
Hi. So, uh, which one was violated?

23:09.800 --> 23:11.040
-She was.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.280
Cool. So,
he wasn't checking out your boobs.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.320
The reason he was in the closed-captioned
mums and bubs session

23:17.400 --> 23:18.720
is 'cause he's deaf.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.680
Oh, he's deaf!
-Oh! Yes!

23:20.760 --> 23:22.200
Yeah, right. That totally makes sense.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.480
-OK.
-Right.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.720
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Uh, thanks for that.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.720
-Hope you enjoyed the movie.
-Yes...

23:28.800 --> 23:31.960
-Oh, he's coming, he's coming.
-Look busy. Look busy, look busy!

23:32.040 --> 23:33.840
Hello. Good film?

23:34.960 --> 23:37.480
I'm... I'm so sorry.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
Ooh-ah!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.320
I am so sorry.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.920
Well, it doesn't mean he's not a sex pest.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.040
Shorts.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.720
Yeah. And that sign could have meant...
'rock on'.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.160
Yeah, pretty sure I know what it meant.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.360
Oh, my god.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.440
It's fine. Don't worry.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
Oh. Oh, love.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.200
Yeah?

24:01.280 --> 24:02.440
Um...

24:05.520 --> 24:08.400
Excuse me. Sorry, uh, I spilt my drink.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.440
Oh! Course you did.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.560
Thanks. Fuck...

24:28.880 --> 24:30.200
You OK?

24:30.280 --> 24:31.560
I'm...

24:31.640 --> 24:33.240
Can I come in?

24:33.320 --> 24:35.880
Do you need my shirt?
I could give you my shirt if you...

24:41.040 --> 24:42.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.280
OK.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.120
OK, that's...

24:57.880 --> 24:59.120
Thank you.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.440
That's fine. You can keep that, really.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.880
No, no. I'll have it dry-cleaned
and returned to you.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.600
I'm a mess.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.000
Oh, Soph, no!

25:11.080 --> 25:13.800
Look, from the waist up, you are...

25:13.880 --> 25:15.000
perfect, like...

25:15.080 --> 25:17.280
Seriously. Look. Look at...

25:17.360 --> 25:18.800
Can I just show you something?
Look at this.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.280
Look at that! Look at that.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.760
That's just back-lighting
and, like, the Valencia filter.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.800
Is it

25:28.000 --> 25:29.360
Well, that's amazing.

25:29.440 --> 25:33.400
It's not amazing! It's fake!
It's all... It's all fake!

25:33.480 --> 25:34.760
-It's not.
-It is.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.880
I'm looking at it - it's not.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.960
And look, Soph, you know all the things!

25:40.040 --> 25:43.000
You know, the pram - you were right
about the pram. It's a fake!

25:43.080 --> 25:45.480
Yeah, I know. It was, like...
it was really obvious.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.160
-Yeah.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.320
Oh.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.320
And look at this - you...

25:50.400 --> 25:52.080
Look at that little boy!

25:52.160 --> 25:54.440
You have trained a baby to sleep!

25:55.200 --> 25:58.480
I would happily have a bit
of the incontinence

25:58.560 --> 25:59.840
to have that.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.600
I would give it to you if I could.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.400
You know, I, um...

26:05.480 --> 26:08.480
I'm sorry. I've been lying about
the whole sleep training thing.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.480
Which is weird, I know. I'm sorry.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.760
But I am useless at it.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.680
Nearly broke our relationship, so...

26:16.760 --> 26:18.360
Yeah. Same.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.640
Ziggy Senior stayed in town at the W
for, like, the whole time.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.080
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.800
Well, that makes you more amazing.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.360
Yeah. It really sucked.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.640
Yeah.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.200
You know, fuck it.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.680
What are you doing?

26:38.760 --> 26:41.120
I'm posting.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.880
Your wet undies? Huh.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.000
Ah. First like.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.080
Are you gonna leave a comment?

26:53.200 --> 26:56.320
Oh, yeah, sure. Um... yes.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.960
Uh, what would you...

26:58.040 --> 27:00.160
Oh, whatever you...

27:00.240 --> 27:03.800
Maybe that... that it's brave and...

27:03.880 --> 27:05.400
and very common.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.800
Or, like, whatever you...
whatever you want.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.240
You know, that, uh... that's good.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.400
Yeah, I'll...

27:12.480 --> 27:14.880
Like... hashtag 'one in three women

27:14.960 --> 27:17.960
suffer some form of incontinence
after childbirth,

27:18.040 --> 27:19.520
I stand with them'.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.600
That's good. That...
It's a little bit long, but that, um...

27:22.680 --> 27:24.800
I'll think of something punchy.
One in three, did you say?

27:24.880 --> 27:27.320
-Hashtag 'one in three'.
-One in three.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.400
What could I...

27:29.480 --> 27:31.920
Do you want to... Do you want me to...
Here, I'll just do it for you.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.240
Yeah.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.400
Thank you.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.600
You're welcome.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.800
"Swept into the sea by the winds,

27:47.880 --> 27:50.080
my spirit will sleep in peace.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.640
Farewell.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.840
He was soon borne away by the waves

27:54.920 --> 27:57.800
and lost in darkness and distance."

27:59.440 --> 28:01.640

-Shh-shh!

28:02.640 --> 28:04.000
She loves it.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.320
It's the second time
she's fallen asleep to it.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.600
Oh, god, isn't she perfect?

28:11.680 --> 28:13.840
Yep. She is.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.560
Sometimes. I mean, she's...

28:16.640 --> 28:18.760
Hey, thanks for helping
with the sleep training.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.840
That foil - do you want to...

28:22.920 --> 28:25.040
Oh, that's staying.
It's great for day naps.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.360
-It looks good.
-Hmm.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.800
Oh, I'll get that.

28:27.880 --> 28:28.880
I want to check the order.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.920
Remember last time?
It was all curry and no rice.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
OK.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.600
Surprise!

28:40.120 --> 28:41.320
Hi!

28:41.400 --> 28:43.640

28:43.720 --> 28:45.240
