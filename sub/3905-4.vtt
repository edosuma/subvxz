WEBVTT

00:14.931 --> 00:15.973
I'm not Beth.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.150
I'm not Beth.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.078
I'm not Beth.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.047
Shh.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.655
Why would one of us be killing us?

02:36.739 --> 02:37.906
What is wrong with her?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.200
Bad breath. Bat shit crazy.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.451
Does she know about me?

02:41.911 --> 02:42.911
About my kids?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.997
How do you know you didn't just bring
her right to my doorstep?

02:45.123 --> 02:47.875
Because she's
impaled with rebar and I wouldn't do that.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.794
I have been living this nightmare
much longer than you have, Sarah.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.714
I explained.
I have a family to protect. I do what I can.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.258
Right. You provide financially.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.595
Yeah, so you wanted that money
Beth was holding.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.305
Your self-defense fund.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.892
You're right, I was gonna steal it and run,

03:05.143 --> 03:06.560
but I can't do that,

03:06.728 --> 03:08.478
because I have a family too, Alison.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.563
My daughter.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.316
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.194
Her name's Kira.
And I meant to be seeing her today,

03:15.278 --> 03:17.821
but there's this killer up my ass, so...

03:18.781 --> 03:21.491
Wait, is she
your biological child or adopted like mine?

03:21.993 --> 03:23.452
Mine. Why?

03:25.663 --> 03:27.956
Don't you think
you should have told us about that before?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.291
Er, why would I do that?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.627
I'm telling you now
because we have to deal with this.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.711
Yeah?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.963
Beth was on this killer's hit list and now I am.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.298
Well what am I supposed to do about it?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.138
How can I help?

03:43.556 --> 03:44.765
Be available.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.100
I may need you somehow.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.818
Wow, rich, man!

03:56.861 --> 04:00.447
This looks like
a new blade inset in a much older handle.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.866
So the fish is a bitch.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.159
Symbiotically speaking,

04:04.202 --> 04:07.246
like a universal way back symbol of fecundity.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.998
But these wings though, they're...

04:10.291 --> 04:12.042
Seriously, what is she on about?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.877
Quiet, she's just weird.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.379
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.047
Okay, going on a tangent there.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.675
If she's not dead, we need to find her.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.009
Find out what she knows.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.679
Are you mad? She's a homicidal maniac.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.639
But we need to find out who she is, Sarah.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.016
She's... She found us, she's got answers.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.978
The only way I'm gonna do that
is go back to being a cop.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.189
No. No way, you're not
going back to being Beth.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.693
Impersonating a dead officer,
that's like a whole new crime.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.362
I think I'm safest with the cops,
to be honest with you.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.572
Did that actually
just come out of your mouth?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.491
Look. Art's already looking for the killer.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.867
I shadow him as Beth,

04:45.994 --> 04:47.786
I let them figure out what has happened to her

04:47.870 --> 04:50.664
and when I find out I can jump off and deal.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.082
Deal?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.167
I'm beginning to realize crazy is genetic.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.671
Well, yeah, bad brain
chemistry can be genetic.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.466
Um, but environment, that's individual, right?

05:01.551 --> 05:04.261
I mean, that's the whole
nature-nurture question right there.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.221
Okay, let's talk nature.

05:06.889 --> 05:10.142
Out of nine so far,
one's a psycho who killed four others.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.061
One committed suicide,
one is a bloody soccer mum,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.563
and then there's you.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.733
My crazy sister is sane by comparison.

05:17.775 --> 05:18.817
Thanks, Fe...

05:19.110 --> 05:21.862
I think this might help us
figure out where she's coming from.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.530
- So I'll look into it.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.492
Ah, police business.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.453
Art's got a lead.

05:29.537 --> 05:33.081
Okay! Hey you didn't show
this to Alison by any chance, did you?

05:33.541 --> 05:35.375
You joking? She'd crap her Lululemon.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.670
Got Alison on standby.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.925
Make sure Jimbo wears his seat belt.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.011
You're sending the kids
to your parents on a school morning.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.013
Well, they're staying the night.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.098
That's not an answer.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.225
Well, you didn't pose it
as a question, did you, Donnie?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.687
Okay, why?
Why did you cancel all their activities?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.731
I just need some time to myself.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.734
You have your usual
Thursday night drinks with clients, right?

06:00.777 --> 06:01.777
Yes.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.363
So I'll see you when you come crashing
in at 3:00 a.m., now, won't I?

06:05.615 --> 06:07.199
I don't crash in...

06:07.658 --> 06:08.950
One time.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.470
Oh crap!

06:30.807 --> 06:31.807
Sorry.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.475
I'm jumpy too.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.644
How's your head?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.521
Probably about the same as yours.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.315
It's a good day to be alive, Beth.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.984
My kids thank you, even my ex thanks you.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.987
- Yeah, don't mention it.
- I didn't, they did.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.656
I got a present for you.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.699
Our killer made a pit stop.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.326
That's his bike.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.121
- They got him?
- No, but we got a witness.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.958
Just follow the bloody brick road.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.505
Hey, there he is, our walking wounded.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.673
You all good, Art?

07:04.757 --> 07:05.757
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.010
Hey, glad you're okay. We're gonna get this
guy. Don't worry, all right?

07:09.053 --> 07:10.679
So your guy wore gloves, no prints,

07:10.763 --> 07:13.181
but he has not exactly covered his tracks.
Go take a look.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.024
Self-surgery.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.027
The guy is what? Military?

07:26.195 --> 07:27.863
Looks like it's gotta hurt.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.406
Oh, and the witness is ready.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.159
- Art, you wanna take him?
- No.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.202
Come on.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.373
I slept through the whole thing.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.208
I can't believe I did.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.253
Trevor came into my room and it was dark,

07:44.380 --> 07:45.755
and he was all wet...

07:46.883 --> 07:47.883
With blood.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.182
He said it was an angry angel.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.689
Hey, Trevor.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.442
Can you tell me
what the angry angel looked like?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.366
Beth?

08:14.452 --> 08:17.078
The person in your bathroom, was a woman?

08:18.247 --> 08:19.247
Is that possible?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.879
Let me talk to him.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.714
Yeah, sure.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.721
It's okay, darling.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.264
I'm not her.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.642
She said you would come.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.395
Pick a color.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.774
Red.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.026
R-E-D.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.486
Pick one.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.739
That one.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.575
Wait, let me see that.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.082
- Can I keep this?
- Yes.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.833
What you got there?

09:05.962 --> 09:06.962
Souvenir.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.385
What the hell?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.637
Hey, can you bag this?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.730
It's okay, sweetie. it's okay.

09:32.905 --> 09:37.033
Yes, once again 8:00, before her bedtime.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.452
- Is that my mum?
- No.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.496
Did you just tell her it wasn't me?

09:41.539 --> 09:43.415
Sarah, why are you calling?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.750
If you don't show after all this anticipation...

09:45.835 --> 09:47.627
Just making sure we're still on.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.254
Well, we are at this end.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.589
Yeah, I'll be there.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.008
Can I talk to her?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.759
You can talk to her tonight.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.974
If you let her down, that's it.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.934
I won't let you see her again.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.353
I said I'll be there.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.369
So you all have copies
of the fortune teller.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.580
Eye witness says we got it wrong.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.707
Jane Doe's killer is female.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.375
About Beth's size.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.627
As for the Jane Doe,

10:28.711 --> 10:30.462
it isn't easy reconstructing a skull

10:30.546 --> 10:32.088
that's gone through a gravel crusher,

10:32.173 --> 10:33.923
but, we do have cause of death.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.719
This hole. 223 caliber.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.014
So, we have a long range,
high-powered weapon.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.726
Name me one homicide
ever pinned on a female sniper.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.269
How's our profile?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.480
Female killers tend to suffer
from chronic detachment,

10:48.773 --> 10:50.315
isolation breeds sociopaths.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.276
This song, "Fearfully and wonderfully made."

10:53.736 --> 10:55.278
She's a religious fanatic.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.948
The stick figures,
the doll's head, the fortune teller...

10:59.241 --> 11:01.910
Early childhood
development issues, could be extreme abuse.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.454
Yes,
but she's also careful in her way.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.581
No prints on any of this so far.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.874
And the DNA evidence?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.794
On rush, but we're still a week away from
knowing if they match anyone on file.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.588
Nothing on Jane Doe's prints?
Her hand didn't give us a match?

11:15.424 --> 11:17.592
No, no. it did not.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.762
Look, the bottom line
is we're chasing a calculated female killer

11:20.805 --> 11:22.263
who loves playing games.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.392
Like these fortune tellers.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.685
Angie...

11:26.769 --> 11:28.770
Certain choices, give certain answers.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.897
Every choice is a different death,

11:30.940 --> 11:33.233
could be threats, could be existing kills,

11:33.275 --> 11:35.694
they might mean something
when combined with the numbers.

11:35.945 --> 11:36.945
Childs?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.531
Childs? Call for you.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.746
- Detective Childs...
- No, you're not.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.374
Beth is dead, isn't she?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.209
What do you want from me?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.461
You could have killed me, but here we are.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.297
- You didn't feel it?
- What?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.049
We have a connection.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.138
Er, you mean when I stuck
that piece of rebar in your liver?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.305
How's that going?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.391
I need to know who you are.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.560
Let's meet again.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.187
I nevergot your name.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.439
I never got yours.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.648
Helena.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.861
And last name?

12:18.320 --> 12:22.490
You're doing police work
but how long can that last?

12:23.492 --> 12:27.370
When the real police find me
you are me and I'm you.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.874
We're both the victim and the cop.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.376
Yeah, that would be bad for both of us.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.504
So come see me, discuss...

12:36.589 --> 12:39.090
I already gave you directions.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.009
Hey, come here.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.095
The numbers, they're addresses.

12:47.308 --> 12:51.519
Okay, 17 is the street number
of the quarry where we found Jane Doe.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.730
Yeah, the rooming house.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.399
Shooting scene.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.817
The kid's house.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.570
Even the precinct. Everywhere we've been.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.654
Except one.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.741
10-24 and GPS gives
one address with that street number,

13:04.825 --> 13:07.535
10 minutes
from the kid's house, Lake Point Road.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.747
Oh, I know that place.
Lot of squatters around there.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.332
- Let's check it out.
- Hold it.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.334
Wait for emergency tactical, huh?

13:14.376 --> 13:17.504
This is a probable sniper,
so let 'em sweep it first before you go in.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.546
Got it?

13:19.882 --> 13:22.717
Hey, don't worry. Let's do this.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.812
I'm parked over here so...

13:33.896 --> 13:37.398
No, no, no, after last night,
we stick together, come on.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.470
Whoa, Beth! Rough night?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.558
Okie-doke then.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.113
Out.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.978
What?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.938
Anybody else feel like
they have a target on their back?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.150
- All clear.
- Copy.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.611
Okay, I'll take you guys in for a closer look.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.237
You're gonna love it.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.230
Over here, detectives.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.405
Looks like more self-surgery.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.994
Can't be long till she bleeds out.

15:58.248 --> 16:02.543
Holy shit!
It's the same figures as the fortune teller.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.881
She's saying she's a serial killer?

16:06.966 --> 16:11.052
Could be her single victim.
Our Jane Doe, over and over again?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.472
Or she just draws like a third grader.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.641
Is this her?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.936
Or her next victim.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.563
Next victim.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.292
Detective Childs.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.752
Hey, it's me.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.130
- Paul?
- Oh!

17:30.591 --> 17:32.633
- Hello, Paul.
- How are you doing?

17:33.135 --> 17:35.219
Oh, not too good.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.971
- I got beat up.
- What?

17:37.139 --> 17:39.891
- What happened?
- Please come and get me out of here.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.813
She led us here.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.899
She wanted us to see this.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.318
Maybe a wild goose chase. Wasting our time.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.779
No. She had a reason.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.239
Okay, let's let forensics have this.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.825
I hope you don't have dinner plans.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.328
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.378
Is it my imagination or does Cosima have
bigger breasts than you?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.506
There's no way
I can make dinner with Kira tonight.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.840
Well, you've got to.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.844
I can't, I'm stuck with Art
and this bitch is right on top of me.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.304
I can lead her straight to Kira.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.016
I know, but Mrs. S gave you an
ultimatum, she's gonna cut you off.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.643
Rock and a hard place here, Fe.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.228
Yeah, your permanent address.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.397
I do have one really idiotic idea.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.399
Oh, good.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.568
I need to be at two places at once, yeah?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.237
- Yeah.
- Well...

18:34.530 --> 18:36.114
if anybody can do that, we can.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.574
Are you effing serious?

18:39.409 --> 18:40.868
Yeah, suddenly I am.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.363
What happened?

19:17.406 --> 19:20.199
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's okay, she's fine.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.742
That doesn't sound okay.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.703
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.252
I'll get the drawings out
to my criminal psych guy.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.421
Where's missing persons on our Jane Doe?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.506
- Nothing local.
- Well, widen the net.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.924
How wide?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.551
North America.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.845
Whoa, quick change.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.431
Huh?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.391
Your whole look, it's cleaned right up.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.854
- Looks way better.
- Keep it in your pants, Raj.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.982
Uh, sorry...

19:53.692 --> 19:55.902
Guys, what the hell?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.369
Nice to know someone's having fun.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.639
Maggie Chen.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.255
I'm sorry, but she wants me
to impersonate her

20:57.339 --> 20:58.839
in front of her own daughter.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.425
- Who she hasn't seen in almost a year.
- Ten months.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.844
This is terrible parenting, Felix.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.179
I mean, that poor child.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.640
I don't think you understand
the situation here.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.102
If Sarah misses tonight,
then she may never get Kira back.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.354
I'm sorry, but a request like this...

21:13.855 --> 21:16.190
Maybe the child is better off
with your foster mother.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.525
Excuse me?

21:18.193 --> 21:20.611
Sarah is out there risking her life,

21:20.696 --> 21:22.530
playing cat and mouse with killer clone

21:22.614 --> 21:24.240
so that your kids don't end up orphans

21:24.324 --> 21:27.076
and you think that she should
lose her child for that.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.539
Yeah, I think you need to step up here, sister.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.962
Well, I did just play
Annelle in Steel Magnolias.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.047
- Seriously?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.383
Glendale Community Theater.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.678
Annelle. An... Oh, my God!

21:45.721 --> 21:47.555
- The Daryl Hannah part?
- Yeah.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.224
It's terrible casting.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.977
Um, it was actually very good acting, Felix.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.646
Trust me, Sarah's no stretch.
I got great reviews.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.523
From the whole neighborhood, I'm sure.

22:00.485 --> 22:04.822
"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain."

22:05.198 --> 22:08.200
Okay, Eliza, holy shit!

22:08.243 --> 22:10.828
We need to pull
a full reverse Pygmalion here.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.475
Guess what?

22:34.478 --> 22:37.480
My crime psych guy says,
biblically messed up or not,

22:37.647 --> 22:39.315
woman-on-woman means
it's got to be personal,

22:39.441 --> 22:41.233
whether it's her first or fifteenth kill.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.235
Yeah, no. That makes sense.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.280
So we're back to Jane Doe
and who she was to Jane Death.

22:47.115 --> 22:50.826
Something's got to give and when it does...

22:51.411 --> 22:53.954
Yeah, right behind you.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.794
These are your worst clothes?

22:59.836 --> 23:02.630
Well, I'm sorry, mate,
but I don't shop second-hand.

23:02.714 --> 23:06.467
No! No! it's... My God, no!
It's not "mate," all right?

23:06.510 --> 23:07.802
It's more like, um...

23:07.886 --> 23:09.428
it's like, mate.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.513
- Mate.
- Yeah?

23:10.597 --> 23:11.597
'Ello, mate.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.393
Yeah, um, that's better.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.479
But, look, you're gonna
have to get past Mrs. S,

23:18.563 --> 23:21.565
so you've really got to play the, um, the
dreary history there, you know?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.819
I mean you basically won't talk.
This shirt is all wrong.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.113
Hey, hey, hey!

23:27.155 --> 23:28.489
Not hey!

23:28.532 --> 23:29.782
You're a punk!

23:29.825 --> 23:30.908
Be one.

23:31.827 --> 23:32.827
Oi!

23:44.881 --> 23:45.881
Detective Childs.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.508
There's a visitor for you.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.641
Hey, hey, hey! What're you doing here?

23:55.725 --> 23:57.476
You said come get you.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.978
What happened? You okay?

23:59.688 --> 24:03.315
Yeah! Yeah, no, I'm fine, really!

24:03.358 --> 24:07.236
You didn't sound fine and you don't look fine.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.197
Come on, I took the rest
of the day off, whatever you need, okay?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.866
Uh, no, no, no. No!

24:11.950 --> 24:13.701
- Paul?
- Paul, I can't.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.704
- Everything all right here?
- Does she seem all right to you?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.874
Okay, take it easy.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.001
First day back, she gets beat up.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.294
No wonder she wants to leave.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.254
- Oh, what the hell are you talking about?
- No, no, no, no, no!

24:25.338 --> 24:27.965
Paul, please. Art, I got this.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.718
Do you?

24:33.805 --> 24:34.930
What am I doing here?

24:35.015 --> 24:36.724
Sorry I overreacted, I...

24:37.601 --> 24:40.227
I didn't mean, literally,
come get me this second.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.353
Then what did you mean?

24:41.563 --> 24:44.899
Seriously, you're like
a completely different person these days.

24:46.568 --> 24:49.153
I'm sorry. it's this case. it's a bitch.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.531
I got upset so
I asked you to come get me.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.744
I didn't say I minded.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.498
Look, we need to spend some time together,

25:02.542 --> 25:05.628
figure out what's suddenly
going on with us because...

25:06.588 --> 25:08.047
Most of it I like...

25:09.090 --> 25:10.090
A lot.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.351
Paul...

25:26.399 --> 25:27.483
You get back.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.626
So, the woman Beth shot
and Helena are connected.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.794
Holy watershed!

25:46.836 --> 25:49.088
Oaky, Beth probably shot
Maggie Chen on purpose.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.131
She never told us anything about this.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.092
Yeah, she never
told her partner either.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.511
I can't keep doing this, Cosima,

25:55.595 --> 25:58.222
Helena was here, she was Beth.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.891
She's going to get us both
busted unless I meet her...

26:01.309 --> 26:03.477
- Alone!
- Oh my God, bad idea.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.854
Yeah. She thinks we have a connection.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.148
- Do you?
- Yeah, we're clones.

26:08.191 --> 26:11.110
Right! So, what do the cops know?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.487
She's a churchy psychopath, duh.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.783
It's personal.
She's a loner, probably abused as a child.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.996
Okay, so the fish reads Christian.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.041
And crafted on to a weapon,
a personal crusade.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.168
Great. Is that it?

26:28.211 --> 26:31.338
You know, when I'm seeing this
branded onto Maggie Chen,

26:31.423 --> 26:33.215
I'm thinking that she's not a lone warrior.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.094
To extreme creationist types
we would be abominations.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.014
Like not God's children but Satan's.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.141
So they hate us.

26:42.183 --> 26:45.894
And she's killing us
even though she is identical to us.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.397
Well, but if you
were a messed up, abused, loner

26:48.523 --> 26:51.984
whose faith compels you to belong

26:52.027 --> 26:56.196
and somebody that you trusted told you that
this was the way to redeem yourself

26:56.239 --> 26:58.532
in the eyes of God, I mean...

26:58.617 --> 27:01.493
Yeah, I might become an angry angel too.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.287
Okay, got it. Thanks.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.086
Something you want to tell me?

27:11.171 --> 27:13.047
About Paul? No.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.965
I've got him wrapped around my little finger.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.718
What's he talking about? Leaving?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.637
--We just got you back, Beth.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.347
No, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.224
- Things are just messy right now.
- Yeah, I heard that.

27:24.559 --> 27:27.853
- But we don't bring that shit in here, right?
- I know.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.856
It's so freaking embarrassing,
don't worry, it won't happen again.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.485
I thought you two are calling it quits.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.988
Yeah, we were,
but now we're trying to work it out.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.241
You know how things go.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.619
Right.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.038
Let's get back on track.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.291
This killer,
you had a close quarters run-in with her,

27:49.417 --> 27:52.252
did you get anything else?
Something she said?

27:52.379 --> 27:55.339
If she'd said anything,
I would've known she's a woman.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.759
Yeah.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.052
We'll check with Beckwith.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.305
- She's making progress on Jane Doe.
- Mmm.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.015
Should have facial reconstruction soon.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.476
Great.

28:13.983 --> 28:14.983
Detective Childs.

28:15.068 --> 28:18.821
Things must be getting
uncomfortable there for you now.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.366
Helena, you've forgot something.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.534
Your friend Maggie.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.537
Oh, you're a terrible detective.

28:27.163 --> 28:28.706
Beth figured that out.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.459
Well, Beth shot her, not me,
if it's revenge you're after.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.879
It's not about revenge, it's about you.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.174
Right, we have a connection.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.344
- You want to tell me about that?
- In person.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.973
You have my invitation.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.278
My name is Detective Beth Childs.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.031
I murdered Margaret Chen.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.659
It wasn't an accident.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.912
I shot her on purpose.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.306
I'm gasping for a fag.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.349
No, you're not, Sarah never smoked.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.186
Okay, it's curtain time.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.355
So, just remember that an insult is a greeting

29:35.440 --> 29:37.107
but you're trying not
to lose your temper, yeah?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.192
Mm-hmm.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.487
And, um... Wait!

29:41.529 --> 29:43.530
Um... Thanks.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.285
Okay.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.913
- Over slouching, you're over slouching.
- Shut up.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.290
Now you've got her.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.336
Oh, hi, Mrs. S.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.882
Not driving a nice, new Jag today then?

30:02.717 --> 30:04.301
- It's in the shop.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.638
You're going to let me see
my daughter or what?

30:15.855 --> 30:16.897
What're you gaping at?

30:37.252 --> 30:38.418
Something I can do?

30:40.463 --> 30:42.047
- You ever fight a woman?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.258
Depends, business or pleasure?

30:44.300 --> 30:46.385
Look, they do say, crazy makes you strong.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.680
But women, they look different,

30:49.889 --> 30:52.933
fight different, smell different.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.602
This woman is a trained sniper.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.480
But Beth taking her for a man,
that flies with you?

30:59.315 --> 31:00.440
Mmm.

31:01.317 --> 31:04.736
The whole time it feels like
she's got something else chewing on her leg.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.532
You know, civilian shootings
are hard to shake. Maybe she's back too soon.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.158
I don't know if that's even it.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.952
Where is she anyway?

31:22.797 --> 31:25.090
Could be she's just
working it out with her boyfriend right?

31:25.258 --> 31:26.258
Yeah, yeah, could be.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.893
- What?
- Nothing.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.989
So what now, invisible ink?

32:02.295 --> 32:03.629
Mind the store, Angie.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.339
Maybe I should come with...

32:05.965 --> 32:07.549
Come on Art, what's up?

32:07.634 --> 32:09.343
You'll know when I do.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.488
Kira, your mum's waiting.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.448
Hurry up, come on.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.332
There she is, look, she's here.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.211
She's won't bite, love.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.550
What? You shy now or something?

32:53.137 --> 32:54.262
Is that for me?

32:56.849 --> 32:57.849
Can I see it?

33:02.271 --> 33:03.271
Oh.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.190
How about a cuppa in the kitchen, yeah?

33:05.608 --> 33:06.608
Wow.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.905
You give us a hug.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.579
I'm sorry, we haven't
seen each other in a long time,

33:19.622 --> 33:23.125
but we can change all that,
see each other all the time.

33:25.795 --> 33:26.795
You're not my mother.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.930
Don't be silly.

33:37.473 --> 33:40.142
Of course I'm your mum.
Who else would I be?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.524
You just look like her.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.614
It's still me, Kira.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.283
What do you call me?

33:56.784 --> 33:58.785
- Monkey.
- What else?

33:59.871 --> 34:04.291
Monkey... Bum... Face?

34:04.333 --> 34:05.459
Where's my mum?

34:09.755 --> 34:14.342
Art, if you're hearing this, you found a body.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.594
It's not Beth.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.597
It's me.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.516
My name is Sarah Manning

34:21.601 --> 34:26.480
and you're about the only person I
trust to figure the whole thing out.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.985
Kira, your mother couldn't be here right now.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.237
Why?

34:48.168 --> 34:49.753
Police! Stay inside.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.130
Shit.

34:53.257 --> 34:57.511
Because she's out there right
now, doing something very brave.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.264
She's making sure everything is safe,

35:01.349 --> 35:02.808
so you two can be together.

35:21.911 --> 35:24.246
I'm unarmed.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.710
Turn around.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.381
Turn around, all the way.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.092
Kneel!

35:38.136 --> 35:40.053
I'm guessing you know how.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.140
This isn't necessary.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.224
Kneel down!

35:46.477 --> 35:48.270
You're different than the others.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.231
Yeah, I am.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.819
You want to talk, let's talk.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.780
I think I'm dying.

36:00.741 --> 36:01.908
Yeah, I think I'll watch.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.710
Where did you come from?

36:12.712 --> 36:15.380
I came out the woodwork.
Where did you come from?

36:15.923 --> 36:17.799
- God sent me.
- Right.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.384
So you don't know either.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.760
You don't know God.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.845
This God?

36:22.847 --> 36:24.890
This God? The one branded
on your friend Maggie Chen?

36:25.433 --> 36:27.726
Maggie helped make you.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.898
And she saw the light

36:33.482 --> 36:34.941
and came to our side.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.069
Beth killed her to protect us.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.863
I can save you.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.949
Right, 'cause we have a connection.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.826
I can see a light in you.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.536
There's a light in all of us.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.955
No! No!

36:49.916 --> 36:54.127
The others,
poor copies of God's image of human beings.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.756
But not you? You're special?

37:03.512 --> 37:05.430
They told you
you were the original, didn't they?

37:17.652 --> 37:20.862
Your people... it's not true what they said.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.156
We're genetic identicals.

37:23.449 --> 37:27.535
- Let me save you.
- You, me, that German you killed,

37:27.787 --> 37:28.912
we're all made the same.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.999
Whoever told you different
hates you as much as they hate us.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.084
You're wrong.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.547
What happened to you, Helena?

37:44.679 --> 37:45.679
Stay back.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.728
Can you feel it?

37:58.901 --> 38:03.822
Beth?

38:06.701 --> 38:08.326
Beth, are you in there?

38:11.789 --> 38:14.332
Go, run!

38:18.921 --> 38:20.463
You don't feel it?

38:33.561 --> 38:35.353
- There's no one here.
- You're here.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.063
Why?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.733
Beth?

38:40.651 --> 38:42.402
The apartment of the woman you killed?

38:43.112 --> 38:44.446
What the hell are you thinking?

38:49.785 --> 38:51.578
How can you be my Auntie Alison?

38:51.620 --> 38:53.621
My mum doesn't have any sisters.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.790
My mum doesn't even have a mum.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.002
Well, it's very complicated.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.171
Um, but, Kira...

39:01.255 --> 39:04.758
I'm sorry about this but it's very
important that you keep this a secret.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.385
Right?

39:07.428 --> 39:09.304
Promise?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.639
Getting on for bed time, Kira love.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.183
Up you go, get your PJs.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.103
Pinkies.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.106
Bye, mummy.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.366
Scoot.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.370
Thanks for everything.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.246
Well you kept your word. You showed up.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.040
I mean Kira.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.418
She's well and that's, uh, down to you.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.879
Sarah.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.343
I'm just, uh... I'm not used to
an honest word on this subject.

39:52.515 --> 39:56.768
Um, I'd like to do this again,
sooner rather than later.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.978
I'm not opposed,
as long as you take it slowly.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.233
So, I'll be by tomorrow
to walk her home from school.

40:04.819 --> 40:05.819
Straight home.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.695
Well, all right then.

40:09.323 --> 40:10.448
Well, unleash the doves,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.618
world peace must be right around the corner.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.662
Piss off, you.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.173
Well, aren't you full of surprises? You passed.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.467
You turned S's head for your encore.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.678
Well, that's something.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.346
--Uh-oh.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.682
- Kira knew right away.
- No!

40:37.351 --> 40:38.852
Oh, shite!

40:45.985 --> 40:48.695
I just don't get it.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.782
Just explain to us
why you were at the home of Maggie Chen.

40:52.867 --> 40:56.035
Like I said, I was taking a walk,

40:56.120 --> 40:58.037
to clear my head, I found myself there.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.165
- You just found yourself there.
- Yeah.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.459
Yes or no! ls there a connection between

41:02.543 --> 41:05.253
the Maggie Chen shooting death
and this Jane Doe homicide?

41:05.713 --> 41:06.713
None.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.798
Well you called this meeting, Beth.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.383
What the hell are we doing here?

41:11.969 --> 41:14.888
After this Chen thing,
I came back to prove that I could,

41:15.055 --> 41:17.307
but, I'm not doing anybody any good, so.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.643
I quit.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.272
After all we've done for you?

41:24.398 --> 41:25.732
Yeah, I appreciate it, but, uh...

41:25.774 --> 41:28.234
But you bail. Why?

41:28.569 --> 41:30.528
What is it with you?

41:30.946 --> 41:32.906
Walking out is not the answer, Childs.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.116
So how does this go?

41:38.245 --> 41:39.245
Something like this?

42:32.258 --> 42:33.299
What'd they do to me?

42:33.384 --> 42:34.551
This is about Paul right?

42:34.969 --> 42:36.928
We think Beth was spying on him.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.304
She wasn't messing around, was she?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.431
Maybe it's time
to find out where Paul works.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.517
What happened to your scar?

42:42.810 --> 42:44.435
Why were you in my vanity?

42:44.645 --> 42:45.770
Tell me what's in the box.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.146
I don't know who you are.

42:47.314 --> 42:48.690
Sarah, I thought you were dead.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.483
Is someone trying to hurt us?

42:50.818 --> 42:51.818
Why'd you ask that?

42:53.988 --> 42:55.780
How could you do that to her?
