WEBVTT

00:07.408 --> 00:09.643
VIRGINIA:
Hey, you there!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.479
Hey, hey!

00:11.512 --> 00:14.648
Hey, person who just cut me off
and almost killed me!

00:14.682 --> 00:16.750
Hey, don't text and drive.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.420
Don't you watch Oprah?

00:19.453 --> 00:21.455
I mean, when she was
on regular TV

00:21.489 --> 00:23.357
before she went to channel 575,
which we don't even get.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.492
Hey!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.227
Hey, wait!

00:26.260 --> 00:28.562
Hey! Oh!

00:28.596 --> 00:30.498
You are so busted.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.835
555-0199. 555-0199.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.670
555-0199.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.838
555-0199.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.507
555...
Shh!

00:39.540 --> 00:41.642
BURT:
What's with all the noise?!

00:41.675 --> 00:43.111
It wasn't me;
it was Mom.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.678
I was making a
fluffernutter sandwich.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.580
555-0199.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.216
It's the quietest
of all sandwiches.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.683
I was going to make
a ham sandwich,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.685
but I was afraid
the mustard bottle might fart.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.754
555-0199.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.125
Oh, you made me mix up
my 941 with my 1040 EZ.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.360
BURT:
Oh, where's my 702?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.695
1040 EZ, 702...
Oh, damn!

01:01.729 --> 01:04.498
Shh!

01:04.532 --> 01:07.535
(whispering): Why didn't you
tell me he started
his corporate taxes?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.669
BURT:
Oh, my God!

01:08.702 --> 01:10.238
This can't be happening!

01:10.271 --> 01:12.440
My gas receipts!

01:12.473 --> 01:16.777
I can't do my taxes
without my June gas receipts!

01:24.152 --> 01:26.720
Why are you standing
in my May-June-July?

01:26.754 --> 01:29.423
Why are you living
in my house?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.660
* Whoo

01:32.693 --> 01:37.165
* Here we go, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:41.502 --> 01:44.338
Wyatt!

01:44.372 --> 01:45.473
You're in town.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.640
Oh, goody.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.509
Yo, J-man, tell Sabrina
she's about to make

01:48.542 --> 01:49.910
the biggest mistake
of her life.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.745
Still trying to organize
"Occupy Natesville"?

01:51.779 --> 01:54.315
No. Wyatt is gonna
do an internship

01:54.348 --> 01:57.251
in Africa for a year and he's
trying to get me to go with him.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.686
To Africa?

01:58.719 --> 01:59.887
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

01:59.920 --> 02:02.290
With all the sand, bugs, and all
that "gentle" mutilation?

02:02.323 --> 02:04.458
I mean, it's "gentle,"
but still, can't be pleasant.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.359
Oh, I'm not going.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.360
So, you're staying,

02:06.394 --> 02:07.361
and you're going.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.231
You're gonna love Africa.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.699
I mean, I've only seen
it in cartoons,

02:11.732 --> 02:13.234
but it looks hilarious.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.368
We'll talk
about this later.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.569
You're definitely
going to come

02:15.603 --> 02:17.205
once you see how good
I look in a dashiki.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.940
Hakuna matata!

02:19.973 --> 02:22.610
Let me know if you need
a ride to the airport!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.612
James,
we need to talk.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.846
Your family's been here all day

02:25.879 --> 02:29.183
and they're starting to push
the store's loitering policy.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.351
Quit cheating!

02:30.384 --> 02:32.353
It's pattycake,
Maw Maw.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.754
You can't cheat
at pattycake.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.223
MAW MAW:
She sure as hell is!

02:35.256 --> 02:37.591
Using only one hand,
saving up your patties...

02:37.625 --> 02:39.893
You're making
a very powerful enemy.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.231
Sorry, it's
corporate tax time.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.300
Dad's no good under pressure, so
it's hard being home with him.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.536
Maybe I can show Burt
some tricks I've learned.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.571
If I can do Frank's taxes,
I can do anyone's.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.306
He doesn't believe
in the number eight,

02:52.340 --> 02:53.507
and he claims a scorpion
as a dependent.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.909
Well, he won't listen to anyone
when it comes to numbers.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.246
Not even that vampire puppet
on TV who likes to count.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.314
I can't remember his name.

03:00.348 --> 03:03.551
Hey, uh, Mom! Hope's got a
little toilet paper on her shoe.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.554
Oh, my God,
that's not toilet paper!

03:07.988 --> 03:09.590
July 15th gas receipt?!

03:09.623 --> 03:11.559
Where is it?!
Where is it?!

03:11.592 --> 03:12.726
July 15th!

03:12.760 --> 03:13.694
Relax.
I got it.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.829
It was stuck to the
bottom of Hope's shoe.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.864
The bottom of your shoe?

03:16.897 --> 03:17.865
You kidding me?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.066
Burt...
For someone who watches

03:19.099 --> 03:21.502
a lot of Baby Einstein,
you're sure no baby Einstein.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.636
Okay, that's it.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.306
Isn't he a funny grandpa?

03:25.339 --> 03:26.840
He sure makes some
funny faces, huh?

03:26.874 --> 03:29.510
Okay, why don't you and
Maw Maw go out on the porch,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.479
and wait for me while
I talk to Grandpa,

03:31.512 --> 03:33.614
and I'll come out and
bring you some treats.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.849
What the hell
is your problem?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
I don't think you know
how serious this is.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.320
Do you want the International
Revenue System

03:39.353 --> 03:41.355
all up in our business?

03:41.389 --> 03:42.856
You saw what they did
to Wesley Snipes.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.124
Ever see him with his shirt off?

03:44.157 --> 03:46.594
He can kick all their asses and
they still threw him in prison.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.562
You need to learn how
to handle the stress.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.763
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.998
You've never had
my kind of stress.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.266
And could you please not
stand on April?!

03:52.300 --> 03:54.268
This is Maw Maw's house.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.003
You don't get to tell
people what to do.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.038
Can't we come in?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.640
No, Maw Maw.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.975
You can come in when
I tell you to come in.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.412
What do you mean
"your kind of stress"?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.547
Business-owner stress.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.881
You-You're just an employee.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.949
Excuse me,
I'm "just an employee"?

04:08.982 --> 04:09.983
That's right.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.452
When you go to work,

04:11.485 --> 04:12.353
it's all moppy moppy,
wipey wipey.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.355
You never even have
to use your brain!

04:14.388 --> 04:17.325
Oh, yeah, and what kind
of graduation degree

04:17.358 --> 04:19.693
do you need for mow-y mow-y,
cutty cutty?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.562
I have to make real
boss decisions.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.596
How much to
pay people,

04:22.630 --> 04:23.964
how much to charge people,

04:23.997 --> 04:25.933
trying to remember which
months have five Fridays...

04:25.966 --> 04:28.336
Well, at least you're
in control of your own future.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.404
I'd give my left nad
to be the boss.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.039
That's exactly what someone
who's never been the boss

04:32.072 --> 04:32.773
or actually had nads would say.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.479
No comeback, huh?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.047
That's what I thought!

04:49.857 --> 04:52.726
This mess should be easy
for you to clean up,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.895
since cleaning things up
doesn't require a brain.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.833
That's what I thought!

05:01.735 --> 05:04.938
(high-pitched screaming)

05:09.042 --> 05:10.444
BURT:
Go away!

05:10.478 --> 05:12.880
Can't you see the sign?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.115
Look, I've been
there, buddy.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.018
I was the treasurer of the
accounting club in high school,

05:18.051 --> 05:19.653
which, in the accounting club,

05:19.687 --> 05:21.522
is a higher office
than the president.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.656
BARNEY:
Let me in, Burt.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.891
We can get through
this together.

05:23.924 --> 05:24.958
Just open the door.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.994
Okay...

05:27.027 --> 05:28.762
Wait.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.531
Who are you?

05:30.564 --> 05:31.899
It's Barney from Howdy's.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.002
I don't know any Barney.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.137
Burt, we've spent the last
two Thanksgivings together.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.572
I'm your son's boss.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.475
All this time I thought
it was "Arnie."

05:41.509 --> 05:44.111
You look like an Arnie.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.451
I feel like I
missed my calling.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.453
I mean, I'm bossy
by nature.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.822
I'm a boss in
employee's clothing.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.392
I just want to know that if I
tried, I could have done it.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.860
Don't be so down on yourself.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.962
When you come home after
a hard day's work,

06:01.995 --> 06:03.531
and your head hits the pillow,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.132
you can rest assured

06:05.165 --> 06:09.470
that you have taught 35
young Americans civics--

06:09.503 --> 06:10.804
the foundation of democracy.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.073
Maw Maw, I'm a maid.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.675
Oh, yeah.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.944
Well, then you're
wasting your life.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.547
Doesn't have to be a Fortunate
500 company or anything.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.048
Any dinky thing will do.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.984
Look at this guy,
he's his own boss.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.519
Stained yellow apron,

06:25.553 --> 06:27.921
cutoff jean shorts,
making a living selling

06:27.955 --> 06:31.124
ground-up pig parts
shoved into a bun.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.127
You, sir, truly represent
the American Dream.

06:35.228 --> 06:40.468
(speaking Turkish)

06:42.870 --> 06:44.472
JIMMY:
You should do it.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.906
You should start
your own business.

06:45.939 --> 06:46.940
I might do it.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.510
I just have no idea what
that business would be.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.878
How about starting a business

06:50.911 --> 06:53.046
where you bore us all to death
talking about this crap?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.615
You'd make millions.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.819
All your receipts are
alphabetized from "A" to "Z."

06:58.852 --> 07:01.088
So, if you're ever audited,
all you have to do

07:01.121 --> 07:03.657
is open this and hand
it to the auditor.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.892
Okay, try again.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.660
(exhales)
Okay.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.563
First it goes over.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.163
No...

07:10.197 --> 07:12.600
First it goes under...

07:12.633 --> 07:14.034
I guess...
Stay calm!

07:14.067 --> 07:15.469
Remember, figure eight.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.904
I'm not an accordion-file guy.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.038
I'm not any kind of file guy.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.940
I'm just a landscaper.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.642
I wish I could
run a business

07:21.675 --> 07:22.943
without having to
run a business.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.478
Well, you could hire
a business manager.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.613
Okay, how about you?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.047
No, I couldn't.
Why not?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.550
It'd be perfect; then I could
do the part of the job I like.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.084
You could do the
parts I don't like.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.654
Well, it would free you up
to take more clients.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.156
You'd make the same
amount of money,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.091
and I'd have a little extra
cash for taking out the ladies

07:38.125 --> 07:40.260
and one more business card to
put in the free lunch fishbowl

07:40.293 --> 07:41.261
at the Indian buffet.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.195
I'll do it.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.864
Good! You're the boss.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.599
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're still the boss.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.501
I'm just doing the parts
of the job you don't like.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.070
Yeah, that's the part I
don't like, being the boss.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.238
As owner of this company,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.273
I order you to tell
me what to do.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.176
Oh, no, I'm not quite sure
I know how this would work.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.511
Well, figure it out.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.213
You're the boss.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.051
SABRINA:
Hey, why don't you start

08:04.084 --> 08:05.686
your own cleaning business?
You're good at it.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.020
How do you know
I'm good at it?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.989
I just assume.
You know, it's cleaning.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.524
How hard could it really be?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.526
Or what about a cafe
where you make

08:12.560 --> 08:13.727
your funny pancakes
and stuff?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.028
Ooh, you could call
it Funny Cakes.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.097
That's the stupidest
idea ever, Jimmy.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.899
If I've had
a cruddy week,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.134
making funny pancakes
is what cheers me up.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.936
But if making funny pancakes
is my week,

08:22.970 --> 08:25.773
what am I going to do
to cheer me up? Scrub toilets?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.575
What about a business
where you snap at people

08:27.608 --> 08:28.742
who are just trying
to be helpful?

08:28.776 --> 08:29.977
I'm sorry.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.079
I just don't want
to end up an old lady

08:32.112 --> 08:33.647
who's never
accomplished anything,

08:33.681 --> 08:35.649
who's never made
any decent money,

08:35.683 --> 08:39.086
just waiting out her time
until she dies.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.654
No offense.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.256
I've made peace with who I am.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.758
You know, Wyatt and I

08:44.792 --> 08:46.694
are trying to make a
big decision right now,

08:46.727 --> 08:48.896
and there is this lady
that we go to for advice.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.731
Maybe you could ask her
for some advice, too.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.932
You talking about a shrink?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.967
'Cause I have never
and will never go

08:54.001 --> 08:56.570
to any therapy
that is not court-ordered.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.338
No, I don't believe in any
of that psycho nonsense.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.173
This woman is the real deal.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.610
Okay, I'm not going to count
any of this.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.311
Let's just say it's enough
and stop.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.084
(children laughing)

09:11.118 --> 09:12.285
WOMAN:
Shut up back there!

09:12.319 --> 09:13.687
Shut up!

09:13.721 --> 09:14.655
Ugh!

09:14.688 --> 09:16.724
I'm watching the neighbor's
friend's kids.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.626
Don't make me tell
you which one of you

09:18.659 --> 09:20.127
is going to go
bald before 30.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.195
It's the girl.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.831
Anyway,

09:23.864 --> 09:25.132
back to your stuff.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.000
Your future card
is the Fool.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.335
(sighs) I knew it.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.370
I'd be a fool to go to Africa.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.105
You'd be a fool to go
to a tarot reader.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.174
She's amazing; plus, she's
the reason why I'm dating you.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.275
READER:
If it wasn't for me,

09:35.308 --> 09:36.644
she might be comfortable

09:36.677 --> 09:38.278
in an alternative lifestyle
by now.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.913
(chuckling): Hey. Hey.
How about a little

09:39.947 --> 09:41.849
psychic-client
confidentiality, huh?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.851
So, anyway,
based on these cards,

09:43.884 --> 09:46.386
it looks like you
should go to Africa,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.956
and you should stay home.
JIMMY:
Okay, well,

09:48.989 --> 09:51.358
the cards have spoken, and
powerful words they were.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.693
Who wants frozen yogurt?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.094
Uh, that'll be $40.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.396
But I do think
you would benefit

09:56.429 --> 09:58.098
from some
aura-aligning crystals.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.733
Are you interested
in that?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.134
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.937
Hey, one of you rug rats,
bring out the crystals!

10:03.971 --> 10:06.874
They're in the back of the
freezer behind the trout!

10:06.907 --> 10:08.108
Want to ask her
for a little career advice?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.312
I think I got
all the answers I need.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.688
And now we wait for the idiots.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.962
How do you like your new
coworkers, Jun and Bing?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.263
They're okay, I guess.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.199
Look, I know you're the boss,

10:32.232 --> 10:33.366
but maybe tell me next time

10:33.400 --> 10:34.835
you're going to hire
more people.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.303
It was a little awkward
this morning

10:36.336 --> 10:38.171
when I came out
and found them in my truck.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.039
I mean, it was locked.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
The window was only open
like this far.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.810
I believe they've done
some circus work.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.878
(Jun and Bing grunting)

10:48.081 --> 10:50.017
They used to work the cash
registers at Howdy's.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.819
I called them the
Chinese Checkers.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.286
That's hilarious, boss.
I mostly hired them

10:53.320 --> 10:55.355
for that joke,
but they were terrible.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.957
I think they'll be good
at lawn work, though.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.259
They'll make us more money
and also free up James

10:59.292 --> 11:00.327
to work more shifts
at the store.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.730
Less responsibility?
Less work?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.698
It's great
not being boss.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.299
This must be what
the E Street Band feels like.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.434
Hup!

11:08.501 --> 11:09.302
Hup!

11:09.336 --> 11:10.871
That's the third time

11:10.904 --> 11:12.172
they've done that today.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.141
I think it's all part
of the package.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.791
Sorry. Sorry!

11:30.824 --> 11:32.993
I don't like beads.
I didn't like 'em in

11:33.026 --> 11:35.295
Bo Derek's hair in the movie 10
and I don't like 'em now.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.164
You're home early.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.432
That's because I'm an employee.
Bank deposits, not my job.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
Paying bills,
not my job.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.205
Cleaning off equipment, not
my... Well, that is my job.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.041
Remind me to do that
first thing in the morning.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.784
I might need
to rethink the beads.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.752
Ah, stressed out,
yet, being

11:58.786 --> 12:00.387
an entrepre...new...er-ist?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.089
What's to be stressed out
about, Burt?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.758
I'm having one of the best days
of my life!

12:04.792 --> 12:06.894
I got off to a rough start.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
Old Maid.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.197
Ooh, that can't be good.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.300
Oh, wait, I think
I switched this with
one of the kids' games.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.836
But then I started
to get the hang of it.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.840
"Justice." Your legal troubles
will be solved soon.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.341
Well, I don't have
any legal troubles.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.442
Maybe it's the scales.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.911
Have you put on weight?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.946
Yes, I have; I put on
a couple pounds.

12:25.979 --> 12:26.814
There you go.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.182
It's easy money.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.085
* Very superstitious

12:32.119 --> 12:34.788
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any better,

12:34.822 --> 12:36.023
this happened.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.491
"Ten of Swords." That means...

12:38.525 --> 12:39.860
Excuse me?

12:39.893 --> 12:43.263
* Very superstitious

12:43.296 --> 12:45.198
Death card.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.401
I see death... in a... car.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.304
With numbers and buttons.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.874
Do you text and drive?

12:53.907 --> 12:56.576
He was so scared,
he gave me his phone!

12:56.609 --> 12:57.878
(coos)

12:57.911 --> 12:59.112
I just took
a texter off the road.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.447
I'm saving lives!

13:00.480 --> 13:01.882
Once I realized
what I could do,

13:01.915 --> 13:03.016
the rest of the day was amazing!

13:04.084 --> 13:06.854
Ah, "The Hermit."

13:06.887 --> 13:08.956
That means stop dressing
like a skank.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.525
There is something in your life
you need to remove.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.830
The mole. Get rid of the mole.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.199
The feeling of power is
so addictive.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.135
So, you're thinking of naming
your daughter "Linoleum"?

13:22.169 --> 13:24.604
Card says "No."

13:24.637 --> 13:25.405
Call your mother.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.274
Buy your wife flowers.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.009
Lay off the garlic.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.311
Call your mother.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.081
Lose the colored contacts.
You're not fooling anyone.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.382
Call your mother.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.616
It's the fifth time,

13:36.649 --> 13:39.419
and the card says the
same thing: "Cut it off."

13:43.656 --> 13:44.992
Oh, my God.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.160
Did you get a guy
to cut off his rat tail?

13:47.194 --> 13:48.495
I hate rat tails.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.230
I do, too.
You get that from me.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.933
I love this job!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.402
When I was a maid,
no one would listen to me.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.638
Now people sit up and listen
like I'm some kind of god...

13:58.671 --> 14:01.108
or Judge Judy.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.343
Burt, I just want
to thank you for being

14:03.376 --> 14:05.445
such a jerk and
inspiring me to do this.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.248
Yeah, well, you enjoy
running your business now.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.883
Wait'll you have to deal
with tax season.

14:09.917 --> 14:10.951
Or boll weevils!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.285
Well, boll weevils are more

14:12.319 --> 14:14.287
of a yardman problem,
but you'll get something.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.259
Hey, Jimmy, what does
Sabrina, a lion,

14:19.292 --> 14:21.528
and the Ebola virus have
in common?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.231
They all might be in
Africa next month.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.298
What?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.333
I might go.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.535
My psychic lady
changed her mind.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.637
She said her first reading
might have been bad

14:30.670 --> 14:32.472
because she was fuzzy
from her glaucoma exam.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.974
But what about the bugs,
the blood diamonds,

14:34.007 --> 14:34.908
the "gentile" mutilation?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.309
I'm sorry. I was saying
that wrong before.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.978
It's not ideal. It's just,

14:38.011 --> 14:39.479
we don't really
want to be apart.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.381
And he does look really
hot in a dashiki.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.649
Yes, I do.

14:42.682 --> 14:48.155
Which means Sabrina and I might
put the "freak" in A-freak-a.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.689
(humming)
(laughs)

14:49.722 --> 14:51.224
WYATT:
Come on, J-man.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.227
Whoo!
(both laughing)

14:56.997 --> 14:58.665
Look, I'm just
the messenger.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.167
The cards are saying it
right here:

15:00.200 --> 15:04.471
"You need to cut that fake
plastic scrotum off

15:04.504 --> 15:06.139
the back of your trailer hitch."

15:06.173 --> 15:07.975
Mom, help!
The reader told

15:08.008 --> 15:10.643
Sabrina and Wyatt to go to
Africa, and she might do it,

15:10.677 --> 15:13.446
so I need you to do a reading
where you tell him to go,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.582
and her to stay,
and make it convincing.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.485
I mean, assuming
that's what

15:18.518 --> 15:21.154
the magic cards are
telling you, of course.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.322
Sorry to interrupt.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.191
We're just finishing up.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.126
Neuter your truck.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.995
Call your mother.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.133
Hup.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.203
(grunts)

15:38.271 --> 15:39.272
Just toss it...
Hup.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.309
Hup.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.178
You planning on
driving, huh, Jun?

15:45.212 --> 15:46.213
That's cool.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.981
We're all just
worker bees.

15:48.015 --> 15:48.748
Working for
the man bee.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.283
I got shotgun!

15:50.317 --> 15:52.652
Whoa, whoa! No, no!
No weapons.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.753
Just an expression.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.156
Put the gun down.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.326
I'll, uh, I'll ride in the back.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.597
(tires squeal)

16:04.631 --> 16:06.366
Hey! Stop, stop.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.434
I want to get a hot dog.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.513
This is not a hot dog.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.782
(shrieking)

16:22.815 --> 16:27.320
(Chinese punk rock blaring)

16:32.692 --> 16:34.194
(retches)

16:35.162 --> 16:37.764
Okay, enough!

16:37.797 --> 16:39.132
I'll eat your stinky noodles,

16:39.166 --> 16:41.501
I'll even sit in the back
of my own truck,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.436
but if you think I'm gonna go
another morning

16:43.470 --> 16:45.238
without listening to
Bulldog Mike and the Queefer,

16:45.272 --> 16:46.106
you got another thing coming!

16:46.139 --> 16:49.142
Hit preset three!
Hit preset three!

16:49.176 --> 16:52.379
I called Barney, told him
I'm boss again.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.247
And then I fired him,
Jun and Bing.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.582
How'd that go?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.417
It's hard to tell.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.618
They yell whether they're happy
or angry.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.188
So I guess I was right.
Being the boss is great.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.622
It still sucks.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.524
It just doesn't suck as much
as not being the boss.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.126
Listening to music
you hate,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.760
getting trapped in
the back of a pickup,

17:07.794 --> 17:11.564
being forced to slurp up
some Chinese guy's noodle.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.400
I could've said that better.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.735
Guys, they're coming,
they're coming.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.137
We gotta get ready.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.279
(sighs deeply)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.481
I have to say, I am so honored

17:28.515 --> 17:30.217
that you two came
to Madam Virginia

17:30.250 --> 17:32.819
for your important life answers.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.722
This is major crossroads
you're at,

17:35.755 --> 17:37.457
and it's good
to get a second opinion.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.327
Damn Jun and Bing,
I can't get their

17:40.360 --> 17:41.661
Chinese punk music
out of my head.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.330
* Na-na-na-na-na-na...

17:43.363 --> 17:46.166
Dad, would you be quiet?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.367
I'm trying to listen in here.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.336
Why'd you turn the music off?
I liked it.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.104
Maw Maw, shh!

17:51.138 --> 17:53.306
Wow, that's pretty clear.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.876
This says Wyatt should go to
Africa and you should stay home.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.678
I can't believe
you believe in this stuff.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.946
It's just a woman
flipping over cards.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.350
Why do you have to think
everything that I
like is stupid?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.851
I don't.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.619
Actually, this card does say

18:06.653 --> 18:09.189
that he thinks everything
you like is stupid.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.591
* La-la-la-la-la, li,
la-la-la-la *

18:11.624 --> 18:12.825
No, it wasn't
pretty like that.

18:12.859 --> 18:16.329
It was like: * Na-na-na-na-na,
na, na-na-na-na-na, na. *

18:16.363 --> 18:17.897
Well, you're doing it wrong.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.832
Well, I'm just doing
what's in my head.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.502
Guys, I'm trying to eavesdrop.
Can you show some consideration?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.304
And it's not just this;
you thought it was stupid when

18:24.337 --> 18:25.438
I wanted to study writing.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.275
Whoa, would you look
at that?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.177
This one says he doesn't believe
in your dreams.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.845
This is going great.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.715
(both humming melodies
in two musical styles)

18:35.748 --> 18:38.351
Not the same song,
but I'm liking this jam.

18:38.385 --> 18:42.322
SABRINA:
Wyatt, this is you going away
to college all over again!

18:42.355 --> 18:44.891
You do what you want without
any consideration for me.

18:44.924 --> 18:48.161
This card means "selfish lover."

18:48.195 --> 18:50.530
Does that mean anything
to anybody?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.465
Why don't you ask "Mr. Tongue-
Kissing-Freaks-Me-Out"?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.600
You have a long tongue!

18:53.633 --> 18:56.203
You have a shallow mouth!

18:56.236 --> 18:57.804
Whoa, would you look at that?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.340
This card says you two are
better off being

19:00.373 --> 19:01.774
far away from each other.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.643
Well, maybe Africa's
not far enough away.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.513
You know what? Why don't you
just go to Africa, all right?

19:06.546 --> 19:09.549
Just get on your vine,
Tarzan, and swing away!

19:09.582 --> 19:12.319
Oh, my God, she's not just
keeping Sabrina here,

19:12.352 --> 19:13.520
Mom's breaking them up!

19:13.553 --> 19:14.954
Sabrina could be mine in a week!

19:14.987 --> 19:17.590
(both humming)

19:17.624 --> 19:20.393
* Li-li-li-li-li,
la-la-la-la-la-la *

19:20.427 --> 19:21.528
* La-la-la-la-la-li-li.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.570
So it's over?
You really,

19:30.603 --> 19:31.771
you really want
it to be over?!

19:31.804 --> 19:33.773
Well, it seems to be
what you want!

19:33.806 --> 19:36.343
Interestingly, it's what
the cards seem to want.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.212
Much like your belly button,
I'm outie!

19:39.246 --> 19:41.948
It is an umbilical hernia,
you insensitive jerk!

19:41.981 --> 19:43.216
(door shuts)

19:43.250 --> 19:44.517
Hey, guys,

19:44.551 --> 19:45.952
I was out of earshot
for some reason.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.887
What's going on in here?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.290
I think Wyatt and Sabrina
just broke up.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.691
What?

19:51.724 --> 19:52.825
Oh, no.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.528
Come here.
I think someone needs a hug.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.496
No, I'm fine.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.730
Actually, the cards say

19:57.764 --> 19:59.432
you could use a hug.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.504
And screw that Wyatt.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.938
He only cares about himself.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.640
I hope he gets hit by a bus.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.276
(thud, tires screech)

20:09.309 --> 20:10.710
(gasps) Oh, my God!
Wyatt!

20:12.379 --> 20:14.281
(hubcaps rolling)

20:14.314 --> 20:16.449
Damn, Mom,
that wasn't a bus,

20:16.483 --> 20:19.486
but still, pretty close.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.555
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.391
Sabrina...
(gasps)

20:24.424 --> 20:26.393
I am so sorry for yelling
at you about Africa.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.695
God, I'm so sorry for yelling
at you about Africa.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.263
And I'm sorry for not warning
you I had pooped myself

20:30.297 --> 20:31.831
before you pulled me out
of the car.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.401
It's fine. I'm just,
I'm-I'm so glad you're okay.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.835
(inhales deeply)

20:35.868 --> 20:37.404
If you're okay with that,

20:37.437 --> 20:40.340
then I'm okay
not going to Africa.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.309
I'd rather stay in Natesville
with you.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.980
What have you done?!

20:48.014 --> 20:49.416
It wasn't my fault.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.883
It was whoever hit his car.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.420
Hey, buddy.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.655
I apologize for running
into your car.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.690
I was dialing the phone to
call my mom at the time.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.526
I had to explain to her why
I cut off the truck scrotum

20:59.559 --> 21:00.427
she gave me for my birthday.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.461
Oh, my God!

21:01.494 --> 21:03.029
Hey, it's the card-reader lady.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.298
I've been meaning to ask
you about mud flaps.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.700
Should I go with Yosemite Sam
or naked ladies?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.936
No! I'm out of the business.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.672
This is too much pressure.
Too much power.

21:12.705 --> 21:16.008
Make the wrong decision, you
could screw up something huge!

21:16.042 --> 21:19.479
I can't handle the stress.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.481
Aha!

21:21.514 --> 21:23.683
It's not easy having all
the responsibility, is it?

21:23.716 --> 21:26.486
Heavy is the head
that wears the boss hat.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.390
(snorts, groans)

21:31.824 --> 21:34.026
That's what I thought!

21:35.895 --> 21:37.897
Martha was robbed.
