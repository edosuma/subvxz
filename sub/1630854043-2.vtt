WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:03.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03.962 --> 00:06.548
I'm Macy. This is Pippa and Bree.
From across the hall.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.049
- Hi.
- I'm Lucy.

00:08.466 --> 00:09.759
I'm really happy you're my roommate.

00:09.926 --> 00:10.802
Me too.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.887
You look really uncomfortable
in that dress.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.433
- Who are you?
- I'm Stephen... DeMarco.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.685
<i>That guy Stephen
is really into you.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:21.104
Do you wanna come out?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.690
There's party off campus.
I'll be the boring designated driver...

00:23.898 --> 00:25.859
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
stay in tonight.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.902
What's going on?

00:28.278 --> 00:32.073
Did you not hear what happened?
Macy got in an accident last night.

00:32.449 --> 00:36.453
Will you stay with me?
I really don't want to be in here alone.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.705
Have you hooked up with anyone else
since we broke up?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.373
<i>I haven't wanted to. No.</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.169
Oh, come on. What?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.463
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hey, dude,
can you get over here right now?</i>

00:46.671 --> 00:49.132
<i>Drew's freaking out.
It's about that girl that died, Macy.</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:57.515
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:02.353
<i>I think I really fucked up.</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:05.815
It's okay. It's okay. It's Stephen.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.527
You can say anything right now.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.198
The other night when...

01:15.116 --> 01:16.451
Macy died.

01:17.702 --> 01:21.372
I was at a party and they needed
someone to go on a beer run.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.084
And I'm the only one with an ID.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.335
He uses my old one.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.798
But when I was... I was driving back,
this other car came out of nowhere.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.343
And I... I swerved at the last minute
and so did they, and...

01:40.767 --> 01:43.144
The car crashed into the tree, I...

01:44.187 --> 01:45.855
And I should have gotten out, but...

01:46.981 --> 01:48.149
I drove off.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.276
I should have called someone.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.863
But I was-- I was panicking.
I-- I didn't know it was Macy.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.286
I didn't know it was her.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.748
Not until the next day,
when they found her.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.334
You know, I... I didn't know
what to do when he told me

02:06.334 --> 02:09.129
and you know I'm not... you know,
I'm not good with this big shit thing.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.672
Okay, all right. Okay.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.925
I'm assuming
you haven't told anyone else.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.301
- No.
- No?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.555
Drew was there anyone else
on the road,

02:18.763 --> 02:19.973
anyone that might have seen you?

02:20.890 --> 02:21.975
No?

02:22.684 --> 02:23.893
And you said you swerved?

02:24.894 --> 02:27.272
Did you make contact with her car?
At all?

02:27.605 --> 02:28.606
- No?
- No.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.276
Well-- well, if he didn't hit her,
it's not a hit and run, right?

02:31.734 --> 02:35.238
It doesn't work like that.
You can't leave the scene of an accident.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.906
I should've called for help.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.533
Maybe they would have gotten her
an ambulance.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.868
Yes. You were in shock though, Drew.

02:39.868 --> 02:43.788
- You were in shock, right?
- No. I was-- I was...

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
I drank a little at the party,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.085
and the ID.
I didn't want to call the cops.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.337
Okay.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.548
Okay.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.967
You know, maybe it'll be better
if I say something... Say something.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.552
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.807
No. Everybody right now thinks
this was just an accident.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.975
It was an accident.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.854
No, I know. I know. But nobody knows
what you just told me.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.356
Except for us.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.990
So, you can't bring Macy back.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.242
Okay?

03:22.076 --> 03:24.162
But ruining your own life
isn't going to undo this.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.122
You're human, you panicked.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.629
This entire thing can go away.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.506
But you have to want it to.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.802
You have to talk to me,
you have to talk to Wrigley first.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.554
Okay? You can't go anywhere
with this, Drew.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.515
- This has to stay right here.
- Yeah.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.102
You're gonna be okay.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.459
There are many ways to navigate
through the gates of grief.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.797
This circle is here to teach us
how others are doing,

04:16.089 --> 04:19.926
to provide a context
for our own experience.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.931
Lucy, you knew Macy best.
Would you like to share first?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.851
Oh. I-- I didn't know her that well.

04:30.228 --> 04:34.607
It says here that loss can be felt
even when you didn't know someone at all.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.152
Yeah, I think death is kind of
a personal experience.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.198
You can go to the next person.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.287
- Well, I'm pretty sure...
- Please, go to the next person.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.004
Lucy, quick chat.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.006
I actually have class, so I gotta...

04:58.131 --> 04:59.841
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.844
The Dean will be escorting
Macy's parents to your room later today,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.846
to clear out her belongings.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.972
Oh.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.474
Okay, thanks.
What... When exactly?

05:08.641 --> 05:09.809
So I make sure I'm not there.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.562
I think Mr. and Mrs. Campbell
might appreciate having someone

05:12.687 --> 05:14.647
to talk to who knew Macy at school.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.108
I'm sure it will mean a lot to them.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.780
Sure. Yeah, of course.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.418
Have you talked to Wrigley
last couple of days?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.087
Yeah, why?

05:38.254 --> 05:41.007
I don't know.
Feel like he's been acting mad weird.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.342
Yeah, he's...

05:42.842 --> 05:46.387
smoking less weed
than usual. For football, probably.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.765
What's got you thinking that hard?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.601
I'm supposed to get dinner
with that freshmen,

05:52.018 --> 05:53.019
Lucy.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.730
Dinner?

05:57.565 --> 05:59.817
- Must be pretty into her.
- I am very single.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.695
Yeah, until Diana
takes your sorry ass back.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.281
Don't act like you haven't
been begging for it.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.241
I don't beg.

06:07.950 --> 06:08.910
I persuade.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.621
- Full of shit.
- No.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.789
Yes, you are.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.376
God, I can't imagine
what Diana's gonna do

06:16.542 --> 06:18.044
to that girl when she finds out.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.546
Fucking brutal.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.132
I don't wanna see that.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.676
I actually very much like to see that.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.475
I actually have class with Diana,
right now.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.438
Yeah, well, just try to least wipe
your dick off between girls.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.817
Please don't act like you didn't have
a body count

06:40.942 --> 06:42.860
before you got fly trapped
by Allie's vagina.

06:42.944 --> 06:43.861
- Hey!
- Yeah?

06:44.195 --> 06:46.197
- Don't talk about Allie's vagina.
- Okay.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.907
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.576
Allie's pristine vagina.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.203
You're fucking rude, you know that?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.955
It's beautiful.
It's just largely unexplored.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.416
It's like... Antarctica.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.168
It's desolate. It's very cold.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.881
With every piece you turn in,
we'll do a roundtable

07:04.006 --> 07:06.509
to discuss everyone's work
and give feedback.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.554
I should warn you, it's hell,
so if you're not prepared

07:09.679 --> 07:11.055
to burn in hell, you shouldn't be here.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.559
For the first assignment,
are we allowed to write

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
about the student who died last week?

07:16.978 --> 07:20.440
This is a fiction writing class.
That's not fiction, so no.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.029
All right. Let's get started.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.668
I'll text you.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.339
Wow, you look pretty.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.262
- Saved you a seat.
- Did you?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.848
Good morning.
Good morning, everybody.

07:55.099 --> 07:59.395
Does anyone have any first thoughts
on the reading

08:00.271 --> 08:01.689
they wanna share?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.569
Let's put it this way.
Tomorrow, you run a country.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.990
Do you lean on hard power
or soft power in your foreign policy?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.245
Go ahead.

08:16.662 --> 08:20.082
Well, if you look at the hard
and soft power continuum,

08:20.208 --> 08:22.627
the critical factor seems to be time.

08:23.211 --> 08:27.215
Generating hard power is quick
because the resources are concrete.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.676
If I look at history, it's been built
by militaries.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.888
There's nothing like a gun to the head
to guarantee an outcome.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.848
That's almost it.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.226
Go on.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.898
She's right, soft power
takes longer to develop,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.858
but it's much more effective.

08:46.567 --> 08:50.279
Coercive diplomacy is irrelevant
if everything comes to you.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.616
Soft power is actually everything.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.077
I can prove it.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.745
How?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.290
Twelve students raise their hand

09:01.916 --> 09:03.501
but you picked
the prettiest girl in the room.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.089
Okay.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.676
Let's open Chavez to page 145.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.557
Hey.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.225
Hi. Thank you.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.768
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you for coming.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.313
I think we should just sweep the place.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.608
- What are you talking about?
- Before Macy's parents get here.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.777
If you were dead,
would you want your parents

09:29.944 --> 09:31.487
finding all your incriminating shit?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.948
Yeah, that's-- that's something
that I've ever thought much about.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.535
Really? I think about it all the time.
Come on, just do it before they get here.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.120
That's the least we could do for her.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.290
Damn, Macy.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.376
Fuck yeah.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.878
Hey, look.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.172
Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.049
- I looked at that already.
- Yeah.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.385
What else?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.512
I don't know. Shit.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.850
Lucy.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.685
- Hi.
- Mr. and Mrs. Campbell are here now.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.645
Okay.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.029
Take your time.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.573
- Bye. Sorry.
- Please, let us know

10:15.781 --> 10:16.991
if you need any help.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.979
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
Can I

10:52.151 --> 10:54.111
help pack anything up?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.822
Thank you. We've got it.

11:02.662 --> 11:07.249
Macy was a really good person.
I-- I really liked her.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.027
Diana? Sorry.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.446
I gave you
a huge compliment in front of everyone.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.656
I don't know why you're upset.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.950
Hey! Come on.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.578
You and I can run circles
around everyone else in that class.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.416
And? What's your point?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.294
You need me.

11:53.045 --> 11:53.963
To keep it interesting.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.132
I want you to take this seriously.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.175
Do you know what my friends
would think of me

11:58.300 --> 12:00.010
if I told them I was even talking
to you again?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.138
Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I do take this seriously.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.640
It's just... it's hard for me in there.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.933
What are you talking about?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.687
I can't concentrate in that class
with you in it.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.231
I'm going crazy.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.359
I'm thinking about all the things
I wanna do to you.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.949
Just... Say the word
and I'll drop the class.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.620
Well,

12:27.455 --> 12:29.749
now that I know
it'll be this much fun for me,

12:30.750 --> 12:31.834
don't drop out.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.131
I do appreciate you trying to be better.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.258
That's about it.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.964
Who is that?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.008
Stephen wants to go to dinner
with me tonight.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.678
I don't know if I have the energy
to act like a normal person right now.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.765
You should go,
you need to do something fun.

13:27.932 --> 13:32.144
Just, you know, be safe
and wear a condom, etcetera, etcetera...

13:32.269 --> 13:33.687
I'm not having sex with him.

13:34.021 --> 13:38.984
Stop pretending like you're not into him.
You've already admitted it.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.196
No. I said I was only into him
when he's in front of me.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.864
So, get in front of him.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.826
Fine.

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
Sure.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.993
What's tagliolini?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.204
Oh, you don't know your pastas.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.790
I know the normal ones.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.844
Thank you.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.513
- So, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.599
What are you going to major in?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.601
You know that song's
about tripping on LSD?

15:35.976 --> 15:38.187
No, it's-- it's supposed
about a drawing

15:38.354 --> 15:39.897
that Lennon's son made in nursery school.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.316
It got stuck in my head
when we met so I googled it.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.152
Wow.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.112
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.659
- I'm majoring in English.
- Really?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.995
- The language you already speak?
- Yep, I'm gonna be a travel writer.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.664
- You sound very sure.
- I am.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.127
What?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.389
I'm sorry.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.018
It's okay.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.024
Have you had a chance
to look at the menus?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.610
Yeah. What is tagliolini?

16:34.910 --> 16:36.662
What? Is it an owl?

16:36.662 --> 16:39.206
Yeah! Yeah, it's an owl,
like the mascot.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.542
Well, fuck travel writing.
You should be a...

16:42.251 --> 16:43.252
artist.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.963
- You're good.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.556
I never-- I never asked you
what you want to do.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.517
- I'mma be a lawyer.
- Oh, you sound very sure.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.522
I thought about what jobs
would I be really good at

17:03.647 --> 17:04.898
and then of those jobs,

17:05.065 --> 17:07.234
which ones are guaranteed
to make a lot of money.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.070
Come on, money's not the only reason
to do something.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.572
It is if you don't have any.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.117
We don't all own Barbour jackets.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.580
How do you know
I have a Barbour jacket?

17:20.330 --> 17:21.874
You Facebook stalked me?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.085
- You didn't Facebook stalk me?
- No, I didn't.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.671
It's really useful,
I know so much more about you now.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.174
This is like a-- a third date
more than a first date.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.552
No, it's a first date, actually.
And that jacket was a fucking gift, okay?

17:34.344 --> 17:35.471
What was that?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.931
I liked it...

17:39.892 --> 17:42.436
I can't imagine what I would do
right now if you were wearing a skirt.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.439
Do you just say every single thing
you think out loud?

17:45.564 --> 17:46.774
No, not even close.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.734
But not saying stuff

17:48.901 --> 17:51.945
when you wanna say it,
you get cancer from that.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.822
You should not do that. Don't. Stop.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.741
- What are you talking about?
- It's just an observation.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.367
- What?
- That you-- you keep a lot of stuff in.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.494
No.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.871
So, who gave you
the-- the Barbour jacket?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.873
- Oh, my God.
- You said it was a gift.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.208
From who?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.419
- Something bad happened.
- No.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.801
I mean, besides the fact
that my roommate died,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.845
so it's making me act a little off,
so sorry.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.014
Right.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.892
I just feel like everyone
keeps wanting to talk to me about it.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.435
Didn't you know her for two days?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.561
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.356
No, exactly, and that's why, like,
I feel everybody's watching me

18:27.523 --> 18:29.650
to see how sad I'll get,
and I can tell that they want me

18:29.650 --> 18:32.402
- to be really, really sad.
- Yeah.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.364
And I... I mean, I-- I--

18:35.906 --> 18:38.033
I don't know. I feel like
there's something wrong with me.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.785
There's nothing wrong with you.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.587
God, you know what the worst part is?

18:50.671 --> 18:52.798
All the fucking flowers,
every day at my dorm.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.968
Like, pile of them everywhere,
and all they do, they just die.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.429
Is that really bad?
Is that really bad that I just said that?

18:59.513 --> 19:00.639
No, no, no.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.933
I can't say that without sounding
like a horrible person.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.353
Why not? You aren't curious
the reaction you'd get

19:06.520 --> 19:07.896
if you just fucking, like, said it?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.439
No, I know the reaction I'd get.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.234
People in high school
used to call me ice queen.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.444
I can be cold.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.238
You're not cold.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.791
No peeking.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.169
Okay.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.014
What is it?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.228
This one won't die.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.186
Be right back. Right back.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.822
Okay, so, what happened exactly?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.993
What did they say happened?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.205
Yeah.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.082
Mom, we'll figure this out together.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.875
Is it possible to talk about it
later though?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.963
You kept calling so I thought
it might be an emergency or...

20:58.173 --> 21:00.259
Of course. Mm-hmm.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.302
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.724
I completely understand
what you're going through.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.643
I'm on your side.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.645
Mm-hmm. Can you stop?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.567
Stop, Mom, please. Stop.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.279
Hey, I didn't... Hello?

21:54.730 --> 21:55.856
Hey.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.948
Thanks for dinner.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.284
Yeah.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.125
I had a good time tonight.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.128
I'm... sorry I got kind of tired.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.015
I'll see you soon.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.770
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.622
Hey.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.583
Hi. Sorry for texting so late.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.128
Wanna come in?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.506
Yeah.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.384
It'll be okay.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.813
Okay, this is too creepy.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.442
Yeah. I mean, like, it was nice
of her mom to leave it, I guess.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.653
But who would actually wear
dead girl hand-me-down makeup?

24:08.530 --> 24:11.575
I mean, you're smoking
dead girl hand-me-down weed.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.201
Weed is weed.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.204
Yeah, I get paranoid enough.
Ghost pot doesn't help.

24:16.371 --> 24:17.747
I don't mind the paranoia.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.916
Who doesn't mind paranoia?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.961
No, I just-- I just mean, like...

24:23.795 --> 24:24.880
like, bring it on, brain.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.548
You know, show me what you got.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.802
Lucy, what are you thinking about
over there?

24:31.261 --> 24:32.179
I don't know.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.223
Oh, my God. Your date was not that bad.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.641
It was really confusing.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.977
He probably knew that you
would never sleep with him tonight,

24:38.977 --> 24:41.062
so he was smart enough not to even try.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.690
Wait, what do you...
You think he'd already planned that out?

24:44.191 --> 24:45.233
Maybe.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.985
Taking it slow could be a good sign.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.946
I don't even wanna date him
in the first place.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.366
To be honest, I sort of hate him.
I hate him.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.497
That's it, I hate him. I hate him.
That's so much easier.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.167
Yeah, well, hate sex is very real. So...

25:02.584 --> 25:04.628
Yeah. Wha-- what's going on
with you and Drew?

25:04.961 --> 25:06.004
Nothing.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.339
Blew his shot.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.258
Can't believe you were gonna
let him deflower you.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.136
It's all I can think about.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.430
I don't know. Maybe it's my fault.

25:15.722 --> 25:19.017
I did get too drunk and then ditch him
the night that we made out.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.062
No. I mean, he did not have
to be a dick the next day.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.939
- He would at least have texted you.
- Yeah.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.190
What's Wrigley saying about it?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.527
I can't start quizzing him about that.
The sex is too good.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.195
We're just, like, keeping it light.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.365
What about that guy, Tim?

25:33.573 --> 25:35.158
It's Tim's if he wants it.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.540
Okay. All right.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.544
I'm deleting it. I'm deleting his number.
I'm deleting Stephen's number.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.045
Okay, that's dramatic.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.548
Just sit back and take yourself
off the platter.

25:49.714 --> 25:53.718
No. No, I don't trust myself with it.
I... It so weird.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.429
Part of me genuinely does not give a shit
and the other part of me

25:56.513 --> 25:59.683
wants to drag my nails across
of his face.

26:10.944 --> 26:11.987
Yeah. Y

26:12.696 --> 26:14.823
Yeah, that's going.
Fuck that.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.951
Done.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.081
Done.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.542
You can't let your mom
get to you like this.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.545
- It's always the same with her.
- Thank you.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.757
Don't worry, no one saw me come in.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.426
Oh!

26:34.634 --> 26:37.137
- You snuck in like a mistress.
- That's right.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.347
Wouldn't want
your friends to get the wrong idea.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.684
Good.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.021
Because we're just watching a movie.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.861
Mm. It feels so good.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.284
Look at you.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.037
You just need me
to make you feel better.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.720
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.195
Why are you so wet?

28:15.985 --> 28:16.945
Just...

28:17.737 --> 28:19.030
What's...

28:19.739 --> 28:21.074
- what's wrong?
- Nothing.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.410
Just...

28:24.577 --> 28:25.578
just need a second.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.335
- Don't worry about it. It's okay.
- Okay.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.224
You stopped me last time
when I was still inside you

28:47.058 --> 28:48.268
and... and it...

28:49.894 --> 28:52.731
killed my flow, you know.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.027
That was days ago, I stopped it
because I wasn't ready.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.989
It's hard to enjoy sex
while I'm angry with you.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.407
Fine, take more time.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.578
But I don't know what you want me
to do while I'm waiting.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.330
So, you're gonna start sleeping
with other people?

29:09.456 --> 29:12.625
No, I won't if you commit to this.
You can't have it both ways, Diana.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.793
You're calling all the shots.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.795
You wanna date, we date,
you wanna fuck, we fuck.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.298
If I'm gonna trust you again,
it can't be because I forced you.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.675
I need to know
you won't want anyone else.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.927
Oh, God.
Is this ever gonna be fun again?

29:23.261 --> 29:25.513
- Everything's a fucking trap with you.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.684
Excuse me, like,
do you even want to build something here?

29:30.310 --> 29:34.397
We're not gonna be in school forever.
A real relationship won't always be fun.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.857
Listen to yourself!

29:36.691 --> 29:38.234
You sound like other people,

29:38.359 --> 29:40.445
we used to make fun
of bullshit like that.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.781
You sound like everybody else.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.158
I'm honestly not mad.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.245
- I'm embarrassed...
- Yeah.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.247
- ...of how stupid I am.
- Mm-hmm.

29:51.539 --> 29:54.459
I love your brain.
You've got this brilliant mind.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.797
It's just so fucking disappointing
you don't have more of a heart.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.925
All this because I had too much
to drink one time.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.636
I didn't even remember her name
while it was happening.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.346
I had no idea
what the fuck I was doing.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.140
What's amazing is,
you think that makes it better.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.226
Would you rather it be someone I loved?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.686
Someone who I was in love with
maybe more than you?

30:13.853 --> 30:17.106
Do you know how many guys
would feel lucky to have me?

30:17.357 --> 30:19.192
Do you know how many
asked me out this week?

30:19.359 --> 30:20.360
And you know what?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.237
I can fucking set my watch
to the second

30:22.362 --> 30:23.905
they get tired of fucking you.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.702
Sorry.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.832
Get out.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.254
- Go, like, right fucking now.
- Okay.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.329
(OVER PHONE) Hi,
<i>this is Nora DeMarco. Leave a message.</i>

31:13.538 --> 31:15.248
Hey, Mom.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.209
Just trying you again.

31:21.337 --> 31:26.009
I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry
about last night.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.097
Just call me back...

31:31.723 --> 31:32.891
when you can.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.768
Okay?

31:38.688 --> 31:39.898
I can't.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.485
Oh, my God.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.613
- Wow.
- Damn.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.240
What? I'm bulking.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.159
Must be nice.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.787
Look, was their food even good?

31:59.292 --> 32:03.379
- I'm so excited for you.
- Hey, guys. Wrigley, did you do it?

32:03.546 --> 32:04.505
Do what?

32:05.048 --> 32:06.466
I mean, I guess not.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.760
Tell the team about
my fundraiser tonight?

32:08.968 --> 32:10.345
- I need them there.
- Oh, I will.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.555
Seriously, if they come,
everyone else will.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.891
There'll be girls and booze.

32:15.975 --> 32:16.935
This is an easy sell.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.228
Okay, I promise.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.023
Bye, Diana.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.775
Who was that?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.652
Oh, that's Stephen's girlfriend.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.236
Ex-girlfriend.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.200
Yeah, they broke up a long time ago.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.297
How many of those
are you going to eat?

32:48.758 --> 32:50.760
All right, what are we doing tonight?

32:51.010 --> 32:53.554
- I don't know.
- I'd do something.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.182
Is there anything to do?

32:56.849 --> 32:58.893
There's Diana's fundraiser.

32:59.268 --> 33:02.438
Oh, yeah. That might be...
something fun to do.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.065
- It could be.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.275
- Yeah.
- I mean, I love philanthropy.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.528
Come on,
you just wanna spy on Diana.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.699
Do either of you know
what they're raising funds for?

33:15.159 --> 33:18.579
I mean they wouldn't be doing it
if it wasn't for anything important, so...

33:19.914 --> 33:20.957
True.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.710
Let's do it.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.379
It's charity.
Feels good to give back.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.006
So good.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.799
Okay, bye.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.518
<i>Yo, this is Drew. Leave a message.</i>

33:41.853 --> 33:42.895
God.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.648
Should we just go over to Drew's?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.025
Give him time, man.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.861
I feel like he should've
at least answered my texts.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.947
You're making it worse checking on him
every five minutes.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.244
It's too much for him,
I feel like he's going crazy.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.415
Okay, well, we're gonna drive
ourselves crazy

34:02.540 --> 34:04.792
if we keep talking about it.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.755
It's just a lot going on right now.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.342
- Are you going out tonight?
- I guess.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.724
We should pregame,
get you out of this lame mood.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.728
Get Tim and the Cyclops over here,
I'll call Evan.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.860
- Don't get beer on my chair.
- Nice. Hey, hey, you want pizza?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.280
- Pizza?
- Yeah, sure.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.574
- Hey, hey! Let's go!
- What?

34:36.741 --> 34:37.909
Hey, where have you been?

34:38.117 --> 34:39.327
Thought we needed beers.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.455
This is why I love Evan.
He brought craft beers to a power hour.

34:43.247 --> 34:46.042
Tim, you and your nutties need
to keep up. Not looking good. Gentlemen...

34:46.167 --> 34:47.251
Let's do it.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.004
- Let's... get going.
- Yes, sir.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.131
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

34:56.844 --> 34:57.720
All that.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.771
Good, right? Told you,
this is why I get the best.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.356
- He knows.
- Hey, man. Wrigley, keep going.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.775
Wait, what was I just saying?

35:10.983 --> 35:13.236
You said you guys are going
to Diana's fundraiser thing.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.821
Yes, do you wanna come?

35:14.987 --> 35:19.951
I think I'm going to give her the gift
of my absence. Make her miss me.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.120
Okay, so, where do you lose me?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.206
I still see you...

35:26.124 --> 35:27.166
still see you...

35:27.625 --> 35:28.584
gone.

35:29.836 --> 35:30.711
Seriously?

35:30.837 --> 35:32.088
- Holy shit.
- All right.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.840
Dude, I'm like right next to you.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.134
I didn't realize
your peripheral vision is that fucked.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.511
Yeah, how are they still
letting you drive, Cyclops?

35:38.719 --> 35:40.721
- Watch that.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.098
Fuck.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.351
Hey, what's up with you, man?

35:48.354 --> 35:49.647
- Oh!

35:51.274 --> 35:52.233
Who? Me?

35:52.358 --> 35:55.778
Yeah. Hey, hey.
Seriously, what's going on?

35:56.112 --> 35:57.238
You seem a little off.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.324
No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.702
It's just his face, don't be a dick.

36:04.370 --> 36:07.498
Hey, Wrigley... I think you're
sitting on something kind of weird, dude.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.501
- Hmm? What?
- That is disgusting.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.378
- What is...
- Oh, shit.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.632
Yeah, the laundry machines
is this building

36:16.757 --> 36:19.051
- are not even...
- Oh, fucking...

36:20.845 --> 36:23.764
He has his stuff set out.
He fucking text me...

36:23.973 --> 36:25.183
- Don't point at me.
- He got this...

36:25.183 --> 36:26.726
Is Wrigley sitting in your cum stain, bro?

36:26.726 --> 36:28.644
- Yeah.
- That's filthy as fuck.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.397
I am extremely comfortable
with Stephen's cum stains.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.107
That's weird.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.281
Hey, I appreciate that.
That means a lot actually.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.534
- That's beautiful.
- We should probably get going.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.744
W... was it something I said?

36:44.744 --> 36:47.330
Wait, you barely drank, come on.
You gotta stay.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.664
It's just so much liquid.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.333
The hour's not over.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.547
Bro, I'm crushing
my side beer right now. Okay.

36:56.964 --> 36:57.882
See you there.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.133
Funny.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.053
Fucking losers, man. So lame.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.442
Hey!

37:18.277 --> 37:20.238
Oh, my God,
I didn't think you could make it.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.200
She's got a real like,
first lady thing going on about her.

37:24.700 --> 37:28.079
- She like glows.
- Okay, or she could be a total cunt.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.373
No, she's right.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.333
Seems really great.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.834
You gonna go talk to her?

37:34.210 --> 37:35.294
No, why would I?

37:36.420 --> 37:37.380
Hey!

37:38.130 --> 37:39.465
What's up, man?
How you doing?

37:39.590 --> 37:40.591
Thanks for coming.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.720
Look at you, waste-face.

37:45.179 --> 37:48.766
- Oh, we did a power hour.
- Yeah, I can see that. Stop.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.268
Hey.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.355
- Cyclops, give me one.
- Oh, fuck.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.065
Why'd you call him that?

37:56.482 --> 37:57.858
Oh, my God.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.486
So, we went to this Hawaiian luau
freshman year...

38:01.195 --> 38:03.447
and he almost lost his eye
to a barbecue skewer,

38:03.531 --> 38:06.659
and had to go to the E.R and everything.
The name just stuck.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.287
- That is so mean.
- He doesn't mind.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.540
- I love him so much.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.675
Sorry.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.136
Would you like to make a donation?

38:27.513 --> 38:28.723
Yeah.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.101
Yeah.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.064
Thanks.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.942
- Would you like any change?
- No.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.529
Oh, hey, Wrigley's friend.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.947
Hi.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.159
- Lucy.
- Hi. Di... Diana, right?

38:48.367 --> 38:50.161
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hi.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.622
I'm glad he actually came through tonight.

38:53.789 --> 38:56.083
- Yeah, it's a good... good turnout.
- Yeah.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.379
I feel embarrassed asking this,
but what... what is all this for?

39:00.504 --> 39:04.467
Oh, we're creating a scholarship program
for kids whose parents are incarcerated.

39:05.885 --> 39:06.886
Oh, my God. Wow.

39:07.011 --> 39:10.139
That's... that's... that's...
That's actually amazing.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.767
Most people here don't know
what we're raising money for.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.435
They're just trying to get drunk.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.938
But... I'm hitting the numbers I want
and that means some kids

39:18.064 --> 39:20.483
might get to go school,
so, I don't really mind.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.234
Diana.

39:22.401 --> 39:25.279
Oh, hey, thanks so much
for coming, really.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.214
- Where are you going?
- Yeah. How did it go? What's she like?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.091
Very much not a cunt.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.352
Wait, hold on.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.938
I'm not usually into that.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.358
Can I try to change your mind?

41:34.033 --> 41:34.992
You okay?

41:38.537 --> 41:39.747
Yeah.

41:41.415 --> 41:42.541
Keep going.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.385
Oh my God.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.054
Holy shit.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.097
Holy shit.

42:29.004 --> 42:32.174
Never liked that before.

42:37.888 --> 42:41.141
Actually no guy has ever made me cum.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.067
Fuck.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.438
Fuck.
