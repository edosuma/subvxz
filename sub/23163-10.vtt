00:00.101 --> 00:01.159
Jump!

00:04.271 --> 00:05.795
Do you know who you are?

00:05.873 --> 00:06.862
I can't remember.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.472
She already thinks
she's in love with you.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.873
She saw him!

00:15.950 --> 00:17.918
If she just comes back with me
and identifies him...

00:17.985 --> 00:19.577
No! She cannot
go back with you!

00:19.954 --> 00:22.388
I want to know why
you're keeping me here!

00:22.456 --> 00:23.718
You're not well enough
to go back!

03:06.270 --> 03:08.864
<i>Hey, Mano! Let me help you with those.</i>

03:08.939 --> 03:11.305
<i>Gee, what took you
so long? Man!</i>

03:11.375 --> 03:13.206
Big waves or what?
Come on.

03:29.660 --> 03:33.323
<i>Hey, careful with that.
Here, hand it to me.</i>

03:39.069 --> 03:41.902
I am not trying
to duck out on you.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.769
You knew I had to
deliver this summons.

03:43.841 --> 03:46.571
I'm just having a little trouble
finding this guy Sutherland.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.134
We've been talking about my
cousin Rita coming out here

03:48.212 --> 03:49.270
for the last three weeks.

03:49.346 --> 03:51.246
You promised to go
to dinner with us.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.907
Did T.C. Say something
about her?

03:53.350 --> 03:54.874
<i>No, nobody said anything.</i>

03:54.952 --> 03:57.420
<i>'Cause all of a sudden,
you're acting real strange.</i>

03:57.488 --> 03:59.285
<i>Rick.
And don't deny it, Thomas.</i>

03:59.356 --> 04:01.153
<i>You've been avoiding me
ever since Rita got in!</i>

04:01.225 --> 04:03.056
<i>Rick... Rick,
if you'll just listen.</i>

04:03.127 --> 04:05.061
<i>The guy has been one step
ahead of me all day,</i>

04:05.129 --> 04:07.256
but I found out that
he's chartered a boat

04:07.331 --> 04:09.492
<i>for the Big Island at 6:00.</i>

04:09.767 --> 04:11.257
He isn't coming?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.597
<i>He's coming, he's coming.</i>

04:14.805 --> 04:16.898
I'll hand him the summons
as he boards the boat

04:16.974 --> 04:19.101
and I'll meet you
at the restaurant at 7:00.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.269
<i>Hey, you got
no right to be there!</i>

04:21.345 --> 04:23.575
Get out of here!
This is my corner!

04:24.081 --> 04:25.139
Who's that?

04:25.449 --> 04:26.814
It's nothing.

04:27.785 --> 04:29.753
<i>Ow! Now, look, lady!</i>

04:30.087 --> 04:31.213
You've got another date!

04:31.288 --> 04:32.448
<i>No, I don't...</i>

04:32.523 --> 04:34.184
<i>Thomas, I can hear you
talking to her.</i>

04:34.258 --> 04:36.226
Oh! Not perfume!

04:36.293 --> 04:39.592
<i>Well, thanks a lot for taking
commitment and friendship so seriously!</i>

04:39.763 --> 04:41.754
<i>No! Wait, Rick!
Don't hang up...</i>

04:43.934 --> 04:45.595
<i>Now, look, lady...</i>

04:47.471 --> 04:50.338
You can't go around
hitting people...

04:51.275 --> 04:53.607
just because...
Never mind.

04:53.911 --> 04:54.900
Sorry.

04:55.813 --> 04:57.713
Nick! Nick Sutherland?

04:57.781 --> 04:59.442
I'm Thomas...

04:59.516 --> 05:02.383
<i>Thomas Magnum,
Future Fidelity Insurance.</i>

05:02.453 --> 05:04.887
<i>Wait! No, don't.
No, I got a date!</i>

05:21.272 --> 05:22.398
Come on! Come on!

05:58.942 --> 05:59.931
Jump!

06:24.435 --> 06:27.666
<i>I felt calm, almost detached,</i>

06:29.807 --> 06:31.866
<i>with no concerns
about where I was,</i>

06:31.942 --> 06:35.901
<i>how I'd gotten there, the fact
that I was floating, not walking.</i>

06:36.280 --> 06:38.009
<i>And the darkness.</i>

06:38.082 --> 06:39.845
<i>Not the kind of darkness you see</i>

06:39.917 --> 06:43.478
<i>when you close your eyes
or turn out the lights.</i>

06:43.554 --> 06:46.717
<i>This was more like a
total absence of light,</i>

06:46.790 --> 06:49.816
<i>with not even so much as a
reflection in any direction.</i>

06:49.893 --> 06:53.727
<i>Whatever this place was, I knew
I didn't want to stay there.</i>

06:56.767 --> 06:57.859
Where is he?

06:57.935 --> 07:00.233
Just said he was on a case and
needed me to bring the car home.

07:00.304 --> 07:01.430
That's all I know.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.599
After he promised Agatha that he
would be my assistant at the museum

07:04.675 --> 07:06.074
<i>while I conduct the tour
in her absence,</i>

07:06.143 --> 07:07.371
<i>after he gave his word,</i>

07:07.444 --> 07:10.675
am I to understand that he
hasn't even had the decency to...

07:10.748 --> 07:13.546
Will you kindly hand over Magnum's keys?

07:13.617 --> 07:14.606
Um...

07:15.018 --> 07:17.418
I can't.
It's hot-wired.

07:18.222 --> 07:19.689
<i>Gotta go, Higgins.</i>

07:19.757 --> 07:22.282
I promised my cousin Rita a
helicopter tour of the Islands.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.553
See you later.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.938
Thomas is going to think that
somebody stole the Ferrari.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.705
<i>Somebody did,
and it serves him right.</i>

07:41.779 --> 07:44.077
I don't see why you had
to go and steal his car.

07:44.148 --> 07:46.173
We held dinner for four hours at Luau Louie's

07:46.250 --> 07:48.081
because he promised to show up.

07:48.152 --> 07:50.620
<i>Nobody, but nobody,
stands up my cousin Rita.</i>

07:50.687 --> 07:52.052
<i>Oh, Ricky.</i>

07:52.923 --> 07:55.517
Even if he did have
a beautiful date.

07:55.592 --> 07:57.685
Are you sure that's why
he didn't show up?

07:57.761 --> 07:59.228
<i>Yeah, positive.</i>

07:59.296 --> 08:02.322
<i>Boy, when he goes to pick that
Ferrari up and finds it gone...</i>

08:02.399 --> 08:05.095
I would love to see
the look on his face!

08:44.290 --> 08:46.417
<i>The darkness was receding,</i>

08:46.492 --> 08:49.893
<i>but it was being replaced with
a kind of emotional turbulence</i>

08:49.962 --> 08:51.259
<i>I had never known.</i>

08:51.330 --> 08:55.494
<i>A growing terror that I had somehow
been thrust into great danger.</i>

09:07.980 --> 09:08.969
Well!

09:09.315 --> 09:11.283
You can open your eyes!

09:17.156 --> 09:18.589
I'm thirsty.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.221
You've been away from us
for two days.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.421
We weren't sure
you were coming back.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.596
Where? Back where?

09:30.569 --> 09:32.093
You try to get some food in you.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.901
You have to start building
your strength.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.740
There was a girl.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.281
What girl?

09:46.686 --> 09:50.645
There was a girl.
I was swimming with...

09:53.726 --> 09:55.091
<i>With a girl, and I...</i>

09:56.829 --> 09:57.887
It got dark.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.423
<i>Oh, you were dreaming.</i>

10:01.867 --> 10:03.391
<i>No, I saw her.</i>

10:03.936 --> 10:06.962
<i>You saw Mano, who brought
you here in his canoe.</i>

10:08.125 --> 10:09.903
You hurt your head.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.539
She's in trouble.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.038
What kind of trouble?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.083
I don't know.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.651
I can't remember.

10:23.455 --> 10:25.252
What do you remember?

10:26.659 --> 10:29.059
Do you know who you are?

10:31.997 --> 10:35.330
My name's Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.301
<i>I was, uh,</i>

10:41.273 --> 10:44.037
going to dinner with Rick

10:44.643 --> 10:48.079
<i>and his cousin, Rita.</i>

10:49.882 --> 10:51.008
And...

10:51.083 --> 10:53.449
<i>You've had a terrible accident,</i>

10:53.519 --> 10:56.386
and your mind doesn't
want to remember it.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.255
You have to be careful
swimming around the coral.

11:00.859 --> 11:02.884
It can be very dangerous.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.292
You try to eat.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.697
<i>You'll remember
what you need to,</i>

11:15.774 --> 11:17.571
when you're better.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.120
<i>You are gonna love
this place. It's fantastic.</i>

12:38.390 --> 12:40.324
What could this museum possibly have

12:40.392 --> 12:42.121
that we don't have in Chicago?

12:42.861 --> 12:44.829
Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.791
And I will be your tour guide
for the next 35 minutes.

12:47.866 --> 12:49.163
Higgins!

12:49.668 --> 12:51.533
<i>Higgins, I gotta talk to you. I'm busy.</i>

12:51.603 --> 12:54.470
<i>Look, it's important.
Give me two minutes. Please.</i>

12:55.908 --> 12:58.274
If you will all move on
to the tattoo display area...

12:58.343 --> 12:59.605
Tattoos?

13:00.079 --> 13:01.944
I'll join you there.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.343
Have you seen Thomas lately?

13:03.415 --> 13:04.439
No!

13:04.516 --> 13:06.279
Neither have I.
And neither has T.C.

13:06.351 --> 13:09.787
<i>And I'm quite certain that not a single
person in my tour group has, either.</i>

13:09.855 --> 13:12.050
<i>Fortunately, he is not
the highlight of their tour.</i>

13:12.124 --> 13:14.354
<i>Now, if you will excuse me,
I am behind schedule.</i>

13:14.426 --> 13:16.553
<i>Look, Higgins, this is
important. I'm serious.</i>

13:16.628 --> 13:17.993
I know Thomas
disappears occasionally

13:18.063 --> 13:19.121
without telling anybody
where he's going.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.223
A practice I would
like to encourage.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.427
But this is different!

13:24.603 --> 13:28.198
<i>Look, he was supposed to have dinner
with us a couple of nights ago.</i>

13:28.273 --> 13:30.207
<i>When I say "us," I mean
me and my cousin Rita.</i>

13:30.275 --> 13:32.869
<i>When he didn't show up, I went and
found the Ferrari and I took it home,</i>

13:32.945 --> 13:35.812
as kind of a joke
to teach him a lesson.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.008
<i>I haven't heard anything
from him since then,</i>

13:38.083 --> 13:40.278
and neither has anybody else.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.823
<i>Well, I'm quite certain that
there's a reasonable explanation</i>

13:44.890 --> 13:47.984
for Magnum's bizarre
behavior. There usually is.

13:49.027 --> 13:52.895
<i>However, if no one has heard
from him by this evening...</i>

13:52.965 --> 13:54.990
Thanks.
I'll be in touch.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.565
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me...</i>

14:03.275 --> 14:04.264
Thank you.

14:09.214 --> 14:12.411
Skin tattooing was looked
upon as a test of courage

14:12.484 --> 14:13.951
as well as a rite of passage.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.817
Let's go. In a minute. This is interesting.

14:17.756 --> 14:20.623
These tools were used
to puncture the skin

14:22.094 --> 14:23.891
and insert the dye.

14:26.698 --> 14:30.225
A tapa cloth was used to wipe
away the blood and excess pigment.

14:30.302 --> 14:33.669
<i>It was quite painful, and had
to be endured without a sound.</i>

14:33.739 --> 14:36.936
<i>And of course, without
benefit of anesthetics.</i>

14:40.712 --> 14:43.681
Let's move on to
the display of war weapons.

15:13.745 --> 15:16.111
<i>The darkness
had rolled back enough</i>

15:16.181 --> 15:18.581
<i>for me to get a look
at where I was.</i>

15:18.650 --> 15:20.174
<i>And as I looked around,</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:23.684
<i>it almost seemed as if I'd
been transported back in time.</i>

15:24.890 --> 15:27.085
<i>I knew that was impossible.</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:30.323
<i>I just didn't know what other
explanation there could be.</i>

15:31.296 --> 15:32.285
<i>Yet.</i>

15:33.232 --> 15:34.494
<i>But I would get one.</i>

15:34.566 --> 15:37.126
<i>Excuse me, is there
a telephone around here?</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:05.225
I guess you're the man
I need to talk to.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.361
<i>You are Mano, aren't you?</i>

16:15.574 --> 16:18.543
I understand you're the one
who brought me here.

16:20.078 --> 16:21.739
You and the girl.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.280
I haven't seen her around here.

16:31.356 --> 16:32.914
Mind if I sit down?

16:43.001 --> 16:46.164
It's funny. I don't have
any memory of being hurt.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.234
<i>Of course,
I don't have any memory</i>

16:50.309 --> 16:53.005
<i>of swimming in my
dinner clothes, either.</i>

16:55.614 --> 16:58.139
Doesn't that strike you
as a little odd?

17:05.324 --> 17:06.848
Is it just my imagination

17:06.925 --> 17:09.587
or are we having a little
trouble communicating here?

17:10.595 --> 17:12.085
What do you want?

17:12.597 --> 17:15.724
<i>I'd like to use a telephone, if
you could tell me where one is.</i>

17:16.233 --> 17:18.464
There are no telephones
on this island.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.028
<i>There's no telephones,
no radios,</i>

17:21.673 --> 17:24.800
<i>no televisions,
no burglary, no drugs...</i>

17:25.042 --> 17:27.910
<i>Well, I'm not going to argue
with you about drugs or crime.</i>

17:27.979 --> 17:29.970
I just want to leave.

17:36.955 --> 17:39.446
<i>If you brought me here
in a canoe,</i>

17:39.524 --> 17:42.357
you should be able
to take me back in one.

17:43.929 --> 17:48.263
I can even help you. I've got a
little experience in channel crossing.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.002
You're not going anywhere.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.367
Not in your condition.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.574
I'm much better. I'm fine.

17:59.644 --> 18:02.442
You're not fine.
You're going back to bed.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.778
And you'll get up
when I tell you to get up.

18:07.819 --> 18:08.843
Come on.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.387
I can manage.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.754
Nice talking to you.

18:24.736 --> 18:28.502
<i>Somewhere, way far
in the back of my mind,</i>

18:28.573 --> 18:31.337
<i>I knew where I was, and why.</i>

18:31.410 --> 18:35.346
<i>But I couldn't bring it around in
front of me where I could see it.</i>

18:35.414 --> 18:39.043
<i>And the harder I tried, the
more it slipped away from me.</i>

18:51.897 --> 18:54.661
<i>Almost as if this village itself</i>

18:54.733 --> 18:57.099
<i>was draining away
part of my memory,</i>

18:57.169 --> 18:59.069
<i>along with my strength.</i>

19:23.762 --> 19:25.024
<i>Was there a girl?</i>

19:25.096 --> 19:27.656
<i>Or was she only a part
of my disturbing dreams?</i>

19:27.732 --> 19:29.723
<i>Had she brought me here?</i>

19:29.801 --> 19:31.792
<i>Or had I come on my own?</i>

19:32.904 --> 19:35.771
<i>I knew if I was going to
find out what had happened,</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:37.866
<i>I was going to have to
leave this place,</i>

19:38.543 --> 19:40.101
<i>with help, or without.</i>

23:41.083 --> 23:44.678
<i>The feeling of terror
intensified and then subsided,</i>

23:44.753 --> 23:46.687
<i>like a wave breaking on shore,</i>

23:46.755 --> 23:48.450
<i>or a very bad fever.</i>

23:48.523 --> 23:51.253
<i>Maybe it was the effort
of trying to escape.</i>

23:51.326 --> 23:53.089
<i>Or maybe it was the ocean air.</i>

23:53.161 --> 23:55.356
<i>Or maybe it was just
the passing of another day.</i>

23:55.430 --> 23:58.160
<i>But the cloud that had
been sitting over my memory</i>

23:58.233 --> 24:00.497
<i>seemed to be lifting a little.</i>

24:00.602 --> 24:02.627
<i>I began to remember
how I'd gotten here.</i>

24:04.973 --> 24:08.204
<i>And I was almost certain
I knew where I was.</i>

24:11.446 --> 24:13.539
What are you doing out of bed?

24:13.615 --> 24:14.809
Cleaning up.

24:16.218 --> 24:19.085
<i>I mean, if I'm going to be staying on Kapu,</i>

24:19.321 --> 24:21.949
the least I can do
is look presentable.

24:23.859 --> 24:25.486
Try and fit in.

24:26.328 --> 24:28.159
<i>Strangers are forbidden
here, aren't they?</i>

24:28.930 --> 24:31.364
I'm glad to see you're
feeling so much better.

24:31.433 --> 24:33.958
I hope your appetite
has also returned.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.630
<i>A little rest, bit of food,</i>

24:36.705 --> 24:39.367
and you'll soon be strong
enough to be up and around.

24:40.709 --> 24:41.903
What's going on?

24:44.046 --> 24:46.412
<i>Makahiki Luau.
End of harvest.</i>

24:47.049 --> 24:50.348
<i>We take all our goods
into the city, and then...</i>

24:51.053 --> 24:52.953
Celebrate?
Yes.

24:54.389 --> 24:56.482
<i>Well, I guess I'll go see
what everybody's doing.</i>

24:56.558 --> 24:58.423
Maybe after you eat.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.625
<i>I'm not really hungry, thanks.</i>

25:00.996 --> 25:02.725
You like to do things
your own way.

25:02.798 --> 25:05.358
<i>Yeah, I used to drive
my mom nuts, too.</i>

25:05.434 --> 25:07.493
Looks like a beautiful day.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.202
We need more stones for these...

25:13.275 --> 25:15.743
<i>Kapu.
The forbidden island.</i>

25:16.211 --> 25:18.304
<i>A place fiercely protected
by a group of Hawaiians</i>

25:18.380 --> 25:20.814
<i>who no longer welcome
strangers to their land.</i>

25:20.882 --> 25:24.045
<i>I wondered how long
they would tolerate me here.</i>

25:27.389 --> 25:30.222
I can't wait to show Auntie Luka
and Mommy these shells.

25:35.797 --> 25:37.264
I'm sorry.

25:37.332 --> 25:39.527
I thought you were
someone else. Sorry.

25:59.988 --> 26:01.250
Probably take more than one man

26:01.323 --> 26:04.087
to drag that down
to the ocean from here.

26:04.459 --> 26:07.326
You people sure are going to a lot
of trouble to keep me from leaving.

26:07.395 --> 26:10.887
<i>Any particular reason, or you
just like having me around?</i>

26:15.036 --> 26:17.800
<i>You know, the thought occurred to me</i>

26:18.373 --> 26:20.898
that this might have
something to do with that girl.

26:20.976 --> 26:23.570
<i>You know, the one that
everybody says doesn't exist?</i>

26:23.645 --> 26:25.772
I have a theory about that.

26:26.314 --> 26:28.179
Wanna hear it?

26:29.818 --> 26:30.978
Good!

26:32.187 --> 26:35.520
<i>The only thing
that I can figure is,</i>

26:35.624 --> 26:37.922
she was running away from home.

26:38.093 --> 26:41.290
Maybe wanted to see what
the real world was like.

26:41.363 --> 26:43.331
Only her family
wouldn't let her.

26:43.398 --> 26:44.524
Maybe you

26:44.733 --> 26:45.722
wouldn't let her go.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.028
She wasn't running from anybody.

26:47.102 --> 26:48.535
And now you're keeping her
a prisoner here

26:48.603 --> 26:50.662
because she went to
an outsider for help.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.431
Mano! Stop it!
Stop fighting!

26:54.509 --> 26:55.840
I told you we never should
have brought him back!

26:55.911 --> 26:57.310
Stop it! We should have just left him!

26:57.379 --> 26:59.313
We'll talk about this later!

26:59.815 --> 27:01.442
We'd be better off
if he was dead!

27:01.516 --> 27:02.642
Mano!

27:05.654 --> 27:07.246
Why can't you leave
well enough alone?

27:07.322 --> 27:10.018
I want to know why
you're keeping me here!

27:10.091 --> 27:11.524
No one's keeping you here!

27:11.593 --> 27:12.890
You're not well enough
to go back!

27:12.961 --> 27:14.622
That's my decision!

27:14.696 --> 27:16.664
I don't want your death
on my conscience.

27:16.731 --> 27:19.723
<i>When you're well enough,
someone will take you back.</i>

27:22.437 --> 27:25.031
Why won't you let me
talk to the girl?

27:27.442 --> 27:29.410
<i>If you're feeling so frisky,</i>

27:29.477 --> 27:31.945
why don't you do
something to help?

27:32.681 --> 27:35.149
<i>With the 'Aha 'Aina!
Luau!</i>

27:54.903 --> 27:58.031
<i>Ricky, you told me Hawaii had
a slower pace than Chicago.</i>

27:58.506 --> 28:00.701
All we've been doing is
running everywhere we've gone.

28:00.775 --> 28:02.470
<i>Now, what I would
like to do is walk.</i>

28:02.544 --> 28:05.775
<i>Walk into a restaurant, and
have a nice, leisurely lunch.</i>

28:05.847 --> 28:07.542
<i>Well, we've just
arrived at Malia's.</i>

28:07.616 --> 28:09.140
It's one of the best
restaurants in town.

28:09.217 --> 28:10.514
<i>Now look, I gotta
meet a friend of mine.</i>

28:10.585 --> 28:11.745
I'll be five or ten minutes
at the most.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.481
<i>Rita, go.</i>

28:13.555 --> 28:15.614
Ricky! Come on...
Go. Go. Go.

28:28.937 --> 28:30.632
<i>Thanks for coming
into town, Ice Pick.</i>

28:30.705 --> 28:33.230
<i>Oh, forget it. I had business in town anyway.</i>

28:33.308 --> 28:35.776
You see that
courtyard over there?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.311
<i>Yeah, what about it?</i>

28:37.379 --> 28:40.576
<i>That's where Nick Sutherland
got hit, two days ago.</i>

28:40.916 --> 28:44.374
Mr. Sutherland took some money
that didn't belong to him.

28:44.452 --> 28:46.579
<i>And the man it belonged to, his employer,</i>

28:46.955 --> 28:48.286
he hired a guy

28:48.823 --> 28:50.688
to even the books.

28:50.759 --> 28:51.987
Norm Vogel.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.955
He picked up the contract.

28:54.229 --> 28:56.891
<i>He's a career soldier,
a real pro.</i>

28:56.965 --> 28:59.365
<i>Only this time,
the job went bad.</i>

29:00.602 --> 29:02.126
There were witnesses.

29:02.804 --> 29:04.032
Thomas?

29:04.639 --> 29:06.436
And a little Hawaiian girl.

29:06.508 --> 29:08.499
Sutherland...
Sutherland...

29:09.311 --> 29:11.643
Thomas mentioned
a guy by that name.

29:11.713 --> 29:13.078
<i>He said he had to
serve him a summons,</i>

29:13.148 --> 29:15.082
but he was having
a hard time finding him.

29:15.216 --> 29:17.741
<i>Well, I hope they have
a hard time finding Magnum,</i>

29:17.819 --> 29:18.979
'cause if they don't...

29:19.054 --> 29:20.749
<i>Can't you call
these guys off, Ice Pick?</i>

29:22.290 --> 29:25.123
<i>Okay, okay.
Never hurts to ask.</i>

29:26.361 --> 29:27.851
Does it ever occur to you

29:27.929 --> 29:30.989
that you're always having to bail
your friend Magnum out of trouble?

29:31.499 --> 29:32.625
Not always.

29:33.134 --> 29:36.467
<i>Well, I think you ought
to consider hanging around</i>

29:36.538 --> 29:38.563
with a better class of friends.

29:40.508 --> 29:41.770
Thomas is okay.

29:42.226 --> 29:43.215
<i>Thanks, Ice Pick.</i>

35:07.518 --> 35:09.816
I've looked everywhere for her...
You were supposed to watch her!

35:25.869 --> 35:28.360
No! Don't go!
Don't.

35:29.106 --> 35:31.074
I'm not going to hurt you.

35:32.009 --> 35:34.409
I just want to know who you are.

35:37.447 --> 35:39.312
I knew you were here.

35:41.251 --> 35:43.481
The headaches won't last long.

35:46.023 --> 35:47.047
What?

35:47.291 --> 35:48.349
I have to go.

35:48.425 --> 35:50.393
If they find us together... No! Wait!

35:50.460 --> 35:52.894
I just want to know
what's going on.

35:52.963 --> 35:55.796
Luka. Uncle Mano.
They...

35:56.066 --> 35:58.762
<i>They've been putting something
in my food, haven't they?</i>

36:01.838 --> 36:03.499
Are they trying to poison me?

36:03.574 --> 36:06.270
<i>No! No, just
a little la'au moe.</i>

36:06.343 --> 36:07.503
To keep your mind clouded.

36:07.578 --> 36:09.136
So you wouldn't remember.

36:09.213 --> 36:10.771
Remember what?

36:11.481 --> 36:13.676
But I wanted you to remember.

36:16.286 --> 36:18.447
I wanted you to remember me.

36:18.922 --> 36:21.152
<i>My uncle said you should forget all about me,</i>

36:21.225 --> 36:23.159
but I didn't want you to.

36:25.562 --> 36:27.359
I made this for you.

36:28.865 --> 36:30.765
The shells are good luck.

36:30.834 --> 36:34.702
You can't find them anywhere in
the world except on this island.

36:42.379 --> 36:43.846
The shells.

36:45.782 --> 36:48.751
They scattered everywhere.
All over the courtyard.

36:53.257 --> 36:54.485
You saw him.

36:56.994 --> 36:58.484
The man who did the shooting.

37:02.266 --> 37:04.029
Come on.
I can't go with you.

37:04.101 --> 37:05.261
My uncle will be very angry.

37:05.335 --> 37:06.632
We've got bigger
problems than that!

37:21.318 --> 37:22.751
You're looking for us.

37:22.819 --> 37:25.947
Did you really think if I couldn't
remember anything about the shooting

37:26.023 --> 37:28.116
that they'd leave you alone?

37:29.159 --> 37:31.684
She didn't tell me!
She didn't have to.

37:31.762 --> 37:34.595
How long did you plan on keeping
me drugged up? The rest of my life?

37:34.665 --> 37:35.962
If that's what it took.

37:36.033 --> 37:39.093
<i>Hey, besides it was you that
brought the trouble to us.</i>

37:39.169 --> 37:40.329
You should be grateful to her

37:40.404 --> 37:41.962
that she nursed you
and kept you alive.

37:42.039 --> 37:44.200
<i>But, Uncle, he saved my life!</i>

37:44.274 --> 37:46.367
<i>Yeah, because you
wandered into his world.</i>

37:46.443 --> 37:49.537
He's trouble! We should have
just left him with his own kind.

37:49.613 --> 37:52.013
That wouldn't have stopped
them from coming after Alea!

37:52.082 --> 37:54.414
<i>If you didn't go back, they
wouldn't know where to find her.</i>

37:54.484 --> 37:57.681
How long do you think before they
find out where those shells come from?

37:57.754 --> 37:59.187
Luka says they won't.

37:59.256 --> 38:00.518
They haven't yet.

38:00.590 --> 38:01.682
She saw him!

38:01.758 --> 38:03.817
If she just comes back with me
and identifies him...

38:03.894 --> 38:05.862
No! She cannot
go back with you!

38:05.929 --> 38:07.157
We can't keep her safe there!

38:07.230 --> 38:09.323
You can't keep her safe here!

38:09.399 --> 38:13.335
<i>Look, in the morning, we'll give
you a canoe, you can go back.</i>

38:13.670 --> 38:14.659
Alone!

38:16.506 --> 38:18.940
They probably don't even
know about this necklace.

38:19.643 --> 38:21.133
You can't count on that.

38:28.218 --> 38:31.278
Mr. Magnum.
Mr. Magnum?

38:31.355 --> 38:33.687
It was a hastily conceived plan.

38:33.757 --> 38:36.021
We were just trying to do
what we thought best.

38:36.093 --> 38:38.323
<i>Please, try to understand.</i>

38:39.062 --> 38:41.587
Alea is young.
She's impressionable.

38:42.099 --> 38:44.863
She already thinks
she's in love with you.

38:44.935 --> 38:47.165
<i>I didn't want her to get hurt,</i>

38:47.237 --> 38:48.636
by anybody.

38:51.007 --> 38:53.134
I was trying to
protect her myself.

38:55.412 --> 38:58.279
I don't think we've seen
the last of them.

39:04.921 --> 39:06.684
<i>Come on, T.C.,
open her up.</i>

39:06.757 --> 39:10.193
<i>I'm trying to get us to Kapu, not
to the bottom of the Kauai Channel.</i>

39:10.260 --> 39:12.490
<i>So just leave
the driving to me, okay?</i>

39:12.562 --> 39:14.655
<i>I still don't understand
what makes you so sure</i>

39:14.731 --> 39:17.131
<i>that Magnum is actually
on the island of Kapu.</i>

39:17.200 --> 39:19.896
<i>You know as well as I do that
outsiders are forbidden there.</i>

39:19.970 --> 39:22.165
<i>Ice Pick said that Magnum
was with a young Hawaiian girl</i>

39:22.239 --> 39:23.638
<i>when that guy Sutherland
got hit.</i>

39:23.707 --> 39:25.174
<i>Maybe there's
a tail wind up there.</i>

39:25.242 --> 39:27.369
<i>A young Hawaiian girl
could live anywhere!</i>

39:28.311 --> 39:32.805
<i>There is no tail wind, Rick. We are
going as fast as we are going to go.</i>

39:32.883 --> 39:35.750
<i>I know that. But I got an inside
tip from some guy on the docks</i>

39:35.819 --> 39:38.219
<i>that does business with some of
the traders on the island of Kapu.</i>

39:38.288 --> 39:40.688
<i>And they say that there's a
hush-hush deal going down over there.</i>

39:40.791 --> 39:42.383
<i>How on Earth could you
possibly know</i>

39:42.459 --> 39:44.518
<i>if there's a tail wind at
a higher altitude or not?</i>

39:44.594 --> 39:46.255
<i>You add two and two,
and it sounds real likely</i>

39:46.329 --> 39:48.092
<i>that the hush-hush deal
is Thomas.</i>

39:48.165 --> 39:49.757
<i>T.C. Says
there's no tail wind?</i>

39:49.833 --> 39:50.822
<i>There's no tail wind.</i>

42:53.983 --> 42:55.245
I think she's in love!

42:55.985 --> 42:57.247
With the stranger?

43:52.976 --> 43:54.500
Don't.

43:54.844 --> 43:56.835
Not if you want to live.

43:57.781 --> 43:59.772
<i>Now, just put the weapon down</i>

43:59.849 --> 44:01.817
and move away from it.

44:20.170 --> 44:21.432
Alealea!

44:38.121 --> 44:39.315
Alealea!

45:03.313 --> 45:04.712
Alea?

45:06.916 --> 45:08.907
You're going to go back.

45:11.287 --> 45:12.845
You knew I was.

45:25.368 --> 45:26.630
I wish...

45:28.004 --> 45:29.972
I wish I didn't love you.

45:36.079 --> 45:37.478
One day...

45:42.185 --> 45:43.413
One day you'll understand.

45:43.486 --> 45:45.886
What kind of love
I'm feeling now?

45:46.522 --> 45:49.184
Makua Wahine Luka
already told me that.

45:51.895 --> 45:53.328
She's right.

45:54.664 --> 45:56.256
<i>For now, maybe.</i>

45:57.033 --> 45:58.398
<i>I think one day,</i>

45:58.668 --> 46:00.158
I will see you again.

46:23.459 --> 46:25.859
You have to take the canoe back?

46:29.299 --> 46:31.096
Unfinished business.

46:45.315 --> 46:47.476
<i>Thank you, Mr. Magnum,
and thank your friends.</i>
