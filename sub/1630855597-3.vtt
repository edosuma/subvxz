00:01.876 --> 00:04.004
Previously on <i>Billions.</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:05.672
Truman had a sign on his desk

00:05.672 --> 00:07.590
that said,
"The buck stops here."

00:07.590 --> 00:10.677
Mine's gonna say,
"I am the buck."

00:10.677 --> 00:12.595
It's one thing to help keep
the trains running

00:12.595 --> 00:14.681
when it was just about Prince
staying rich and getting richer.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.725
But I have decided
that he is dangerous.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.852
Mr. Rhoads,
charges are dismissed.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.520
You are free to go.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.188
<i>What's got your eye?</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:23.690
You must be fielding job offers
by the dozen.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.650
I'm talking about US Attorney,

00:25.650 --> 00:28.028
Southern district of New York.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.155
- This guy's a fuckin' badass!
- OlÃ©!

00:30.155 --> 00:32.198
This is the best thing that's
ever happened on this floor.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.325
He's got that
"Winston Dick Energy" happening.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.036
<i>And when we win,</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
you'll be feted
as a miracle worker.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.831
You're not a politician.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.541
You're hoping to contribute
by doing a public service.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.209
A statesman.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.669
Let's do this!

00:46.087 --> 00:47.547
Mr. President.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.051
It is an honor to hear from you.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.716
Hi, Mr. Wagner.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.052
Let's see what's
in the old footlocker, Omar.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.471
Let me get you your bottle.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.107
<i>Oh the heads that turn</i>

01:48.525 --> 01:51.611
<i>Make my back burn</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:54.072
<i>And those heads that turn</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:59.119
<i>Make my back,
Make my back burn</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:09.712
Here's your bottle.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.634
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:14.634 --> 02:17.470
the author himself,
Michael Lewis.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.723
So the street has changed.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.643
It's been cleaned up. Sanitized.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.311
I mean, no one says
"fuck" anymore.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.438
They've taken the strippers off

02:27.438 --> 02:28.982
the trading floors.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.609
In a way,
the lie has gone deeper

02:31.609 --> 02:33.111
because no one on the outside

02:33.111 --> 02:34.821
looks the way they are
on the inside.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.700
Except for you. I think of you
as the last holdout.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.869
The last wolves
in wolves' clothing.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.329
The last crass motherfuckers.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.999
So in that spirit,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.126
let's raise a glass
to crass motherfuckers

02:48.126 --> 02:50.170
and the 35th anniversary
of <i>Liar's Poker.</i>

02:54.257 --> 02:56.426
What a beautiful con
you've pulled, Lewis.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.053
They all think <i>Liar's Poker</i> was
a love letter to them. Kudos.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.806
It wasn't a con, Wags.
I just wrote it the way it was.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.349
And people see in it
what they want to see.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.977
Hmm. Like disco balls
and coke mirrors.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.020
Salut.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.024
Hey, you really got us right. Thanks.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.609
You're gonna have to
tell me your name.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.068
- Clark.
- Ah, Clark.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.699
Eric fuckin' Scott.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.535
Wags!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.120
Glad to see you haven't
decamped to Florida yet

03:24.120 --> 03:25.330
like the the rest of 'em.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
I must love taxes

03:27.040 --> 03:29.209
and a bodega
bacon, egg and cheese.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.544
That's why I'm still
slugging it out in Gotham.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.755
No, the rumor is
your guy's rolling in Europe.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.757
New guy, new money now.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.552
And I'm making room in the Ark
for a select few old friends.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.263
Mike Wagner playing pitchman?
Sad.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.723
Maybe New York is dead
after all

03:43.723 --> 03:45.433
and I should be packing
for Brickell.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.061
I'm not selling you
a Veg-O-Matic here, buddy.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.063
I'm giving you a chance
to turn your wad over

03:50.063 --> 03:51.356
a last time or two.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.234
Let's drink on this.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.902
You are a legend, Wags,

03:55.902 --> 03:58.571
so I wanna hear you out.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.657
You're the guy that ran up
a tab so high at Ponte's

04:00.657 --> 04:03.284
that Joe almost had to take
out a mob loan

04:03.284 --> 04:05.662
just to keep serving
those angry lobsters.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.413
Oh, Ponte's was nothing.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.165
Do you remember when
you went to Career Day

04:09.165 --> 04:11.084
for that escort's kid?

04:11.084 --> 04:14.045
What was that, '96?
That fucking killed me.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.005
Her name was Claire.
She was special to me.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.423
Right, Claire.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.841
You hired her for, uh,

04:18.841 --> 04:20.551
that Tiger Cub's
bachelor party.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.595
Oh, that's right.
The poor guy got simplex

04:22.595 --> 04:24.222
on his lip on his wedding day.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.849
You hired him
'cause you felt so bad.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.434
Yeah, till he tanked
one quarter

04:28.434 --> 04:30.436
and Wags used his desk
as a urinal.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.938
Well, there was a day

04:31.938 --> 04:33.606
you stepped wrong
on Wags' trading floor,

04:33.606 --> 04:37.568
and he would bloody you up
like Jake the Muss.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.279
I can still walk the walk.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.655
Mm.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.282
You should hear me on this:

04:42.282 --> 04:46.286
Michael Prince Capital
is where you want to be.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.121
We're not taking on
institutional money,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.790
but like I said...

04:50.790 --> 04:52.625
I can get exceptions made
for you lugs.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.294
And I'll make some room
in the fund

04:54.294 --> 04:55.920
for some of your clients,
but only the A-listers.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.630
Make you look like superstars.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.591
You always did have
the best ideas about...

05:00.591 --> 05:02.302
which club to hit
after the Super Bowl,

05:02.302 --> 05:05.388
or where to get the best
space cakes in Amsterdam.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.098
And he killed it
'cause that fucking attitude

05:07.098 --> 05:09.309
drove you like Max Verstappen.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.852
No offense, but now...

05:10.852 --> 05:14.230
you got about as much edge
as Barry Manilow.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.815
Offense fucking taken.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.400
Hey, hey, hey,

05:17.400 --> 05:18.985
everybody gets left behind
at some point.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.987
You privately embrace
your obsolescence

05:20.987 --> 05:23.072
and hope nobody
notices for a while.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.949
Speak for yourself, motherfucker.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.659
It was one thing when
you worked for a bad ass,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.494
but now you're in
a politician's stable,

05:28.494 --> 05:32.832
which is one step away
from the fucking glue factory.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.501
Keep talking
and I'll mollywop ya right here

05:35.501 --> 05:37.003
in front of the whole gang.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.966
I'll wait a while
for the Cialis to kick in.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.843
Hey, Omar,

05:43.843 --> 05:46.012
put my bottle back
in the locker.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.180
Let these assholes go back

05:47.180 --> 05:48.639
to choking on their usual swill.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.688
Well, he got fucking sensitive.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.857
You couldn't buy it
for yourself,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.984
so I figured I would.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.242
It's perfect.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.205
Heading out?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.790
Yeah, but you might not want to

06:13.790 --> 06:15.249
leave the office for a while.

06:15.249 --> 06:18.086
Oh, the going away thing, yeah.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.380
Scooter's got it.
I-I have something else.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.394
Gratitude, shame, entitlement,

06:34.394 --> 06:37.730
these are our...

06:37.730 --> 06:39.857
I don't really
traffic in that crap.

06:39.857 --> 06:43.403
No, on this occasion,
the eve of my departure,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.905
I would like to say
to you all...

06:45.905 --> 06:48.908
I would like to say:
You're welcome,

06:48.908 --> 06:50.827
for all that I've
brought to MPC.

06:50.827 --> 06:55.415
And in the words of
the great poet DJ Khaled,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.750
"Every time I step
up in the building,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.086
everybody hands go up,

07:00.086 --> 07:01.629
and they stay there.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.549
'Cause all I do is win."

07:04.549 --> 07:08.428
Anyone else care
to say something?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.638
- You sure?
- Is it weird that I'll miss him?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.890
- Objectively, yes.
- Right?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.643
- Yeah, fuck you, Winston.
- But after the "Princident,"

07:15.643 --> 07:17.895
Winston was the only one
who looked at me the same way.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.397
But that way was slavish
and pathetic.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.232
Don't be shy.
Anybody?

07:21.232 --> 07:23.526
Anybody?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.278
Okay, then. I'll just say
one more thing.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.864
Ah, actually, Winston,
I have something to share.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.115
Is Prince coming?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.784
Uh, no. No, he's not.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.953
He's... not.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.289
But he did ask me
to convey to you

07:36.289 --> 07:39.125
that you truly have been
a member of this...

07:39.125 --> 07:40.793
- Team!
- He said "organization."

07:40.793 --> 07:42.420
He usually calls it a team.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.838
This time he went
with organization.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.467
And so, yeah.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.552
Goodbye and thanks.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.946
Goodbye.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.089
I hate it. And you're proposing
to send a copy of it

08:27.089 --> 08:30.051
to Chuck Rhoades?
I hate everything about that.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.928
Can you figure out
why I love it?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.012
Are you that good?

08:34.555 --> 08:36.933
Okay. Okay.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.352
The purpose of
a Super PAC is to get

08:39.352 --> 08:42.146
high-net-worth supporters
to invest in your candidacy

08:42.146 --> 08:44.982
in a way that seems arms-length.
You know this.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.026
The idea is not to put yourself
in a position

08:47.026 --> 08:49.195
where you're gonna face
federal charges.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.364
That is, I concede,
the usual plan.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.534
Ah.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.369
You're running a dye test here.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.871
You want to see if Chuck Rhoades
is paying attention?

09:00.665 --> 09:04.293
Okay. A trainer feeds
a caged tiger fresh beef

09:04.293 --> 09:07.630
so it develops a taste for that
instead of trainer.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.841
The tiger's waiting by his door,
same time every day,

09:10.841 --> 09:12.760
ready to pounce on it.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.595
But you know the scariest moment
of a trainer's life?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.473
When he goes inside
the enclosure

09:17.473 --> 09:19.058
and the cat isn't there.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.560
They can't see it.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.270
Doesn't mean that
cat escaped,

09:22.270 --> 09:23.813
it means it's hiding,

09:23.813 --> 09:26.524
ready to revert
to its nature and hunt.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.150
I can't afford to let
Chuck Rhoades

09:28.150 --> 09:29.860
revert to his nature.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.946
So you're feeding him
some red meat,

09:31.946 --> 09:34.115
so you know exactly
where he's coming from.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.449
That's right.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.369
Still hate it.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.037
Can I still hate it? 'Cause...

09:40.037 --> 09:42.999
...still hate it.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.126
Kate Sacker's
gonna get it to him.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.341
Hi, Wendy.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.926
I was wondering if you could
write me a prescription.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.969
For Wellbutrin.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.723
Um, if necessary, of course.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.850
Why don't we set
an intake session for tomorrow

10:00.850 --> 10:02.435
- then we can decide--
- I only need one, actually.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.520
One pill?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.355
I've been taking it
for a while now,

10:06.355 --> 10:08.107
and it's a good fit.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.859
I just dropped my last one
down the sink this morning,

10:09.859 --> 10:11.611
and my, uh,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.071
prescriber has been out of town
for a couple of days.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.906
I'll be able to get
my full refill soon.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.825
Your "prescriber"--
you mean your GP?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.119
Um...

10:20.119 --> 10:21.829
- Yeah.
- Ben Kim,

10:21.829 --> 10:24.457
who prescribed the Wellbutrin?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.293
Fine. I've been seeing
an outside psychiatrist.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.919
She prescribed the meds,

10:28.919 --> 10:30.129
but she's been in Vienna
for a conference.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.922
Getting back tomorrow night.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.091
I see. Um...

10:34.091 --> 10:36.177
How long have you been
seeing this doctor?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.597
Respectfully, this is
separate from what you do.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.307
We all think you're an awesome
performance coach--

10:41.307 --> 10:43.851
Three months? Longer?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.104
Six months.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.358
So, um...

10:50.358 --> 10:51.984
will you help?

10:51.984 --> 10:53.903
With the prescription?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.988
Of course, yes.

11:03.079 --> 11:07.083
"We all."
Who else is seeing her?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.967
I assume we're taking
down the Russ & Daughters novi

11:16.967 --> 11:19.011
in this random office
so that yours doesn't smell like

11:19.011 --> 11:21.972
an appetizing shop
during your next meeting?

11:21.972 --> 11:24.392
Actually, this is your office.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.646
If you want it.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.403
"Come join me for a celebratory
kickoff breakfast, Ira."

11:35.403 --> 11:37.488
Of course, it couldn't be
just that. It was a trap.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.240
Oh!

11:39.240 --> 11:42.868
Trap sounds so sinister.
No. It's an opportunity.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.662
Come on, you've got the money,

11:44.662 --> 11:46.580
you've got the wife,
the new kid.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.873
But you know what
you're missing?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.250
An alpaca?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.876
The juice! The action!

11:50.876 --> 11:52.878
Sense of mission.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.131
The long hours.
The long odds.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.716
The shitty pay.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.884
Ah, Chuck, I've been
a prosecutor before--

11:58.884 --> 12:01.721
N-n-no, we were just
line prosses back then.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.890
Answering up. You've never
done it with me in charge.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.310
Only running the ops we choose,
fighting back to back,

12:08.310 --> 12:09.895
no matter how outgunned by

12:09.895 --> 12:12.189
pricey douchebag
defense attorneys.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.985
Taking down the even bigger
douchebags who employ them.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.612
Be my Deputy US Attorney.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.993
Nope. No way.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.245
I'm sorry. You know
I'd love to spend all day

12:26.245 --> 12:28.414
hanging with you.
That's the alluring part.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.458
- Mm.
- And the...

12:30.458 --> 12:32.752
chance to do a thing that
actually matters does appeal...

12:32.752 --> 12:35.296
I'll stay quiet and let you
talk yourself into it.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.922
But you know we'd end up
arguing all day.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.424
There's no conversation
more boring

12:38.424 --> 12:41.135
than the one
where everyone agrees.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.721
Montaigne's a deep pull,
I'll give you that.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.140
Oh.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.975
Swabbies are on the deck, boss.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.102
Ah, I see you've succeeded
with one recruit at least.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.856
Just one? You sure?
At least one.

13:06.327 --> 13:10.539
I am genuinely
thrilled to be here.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.208
And I don't thrill easy.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.918
Uh-uh.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.795
Oh, we're going to hold
the rich and powerful

13:15.795 --> 13:18.380
and criminal accountable
for their actions,

13:18.380 --> 13:19.840
no matter the cost.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.927
I want you to go back
to your desks

13:22.927 --> 13:25.429
and pull the cases you
thought were too hot,

13:25.429 --> 13:28.140
too hard, too close
to the third rail.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.809
Pitch me those cases--

13:29.809 --> 13:31.727
directly,
not through channels--

13:31.727 --> 13:35.606
and together we will take
that unformed carbon

13:35.606 --> 13:38.234
and pressurize it
into diamonds.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.320
Into wins.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.366
All right, let's do it.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.670
Fuck no,
I don't see a shrink.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.297
Do you talk about work
with your other therapist?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.967
Yes.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.135
But it's a totally
separate thing.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.971
Church and state, you know?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.598
Dr. Mayer is
your classic Freudian.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.350
She's all about
getting to the "why,"

14:11.350 --> 14:13.352
even if it has
unexpected results.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.187
It's a trip.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.148
Seems I have a lot of resentment
for maternal figures in my life.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.193
I mostly talk about weird
recurring dreams with her.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.654
Like, you don't need to
know about sex dreams, right?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.865
It's not work relevant.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.701
Except like, when
it's about the displacement

14:28.701 --> 14:32.162
and sublimation of
my desires in the workplace.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.123
But it's only sometimes
about that.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.833
I know my rights.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.668
That includes
the Patient's Bill of Rights,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.169
to not discuss shit
about what I discuss

14:39.169 --> 14:40.546
or with whom I discuss.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.007
- So there is someone?
- Or if I discuss.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.843
I tell all my friends, just
because a cop asks a question

14:45.843 --> 14:47.177
doesn't mean you gotta answer.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.054
I owe Dr. Mayer big time.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.348
I used to wake up from about
3 to 4 a.m. each night

14:51.348 --> 14:53.726
replaying this conversation
I had once with an ex.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.394
What kind of conversation?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.729
Well, that's
between me and the doc.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.188
But the thing is, it's gone.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.607
And now I'm all Z's
from eyes shut

14:59.607 --> 15:01.191
till open in the morning.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.402
So you've never met
with Dr. Mayer?

15:03.402 --> 15:06.155
Okay, fine. I just started.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.824
I hardly said anything
in my sessions.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.868
So it hasn't really
paid off for you?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.995
Can't say that. No.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.206
I'd been burying
some of my natural

15:16.206 --> 15:19.084
aggressive tendencies
since the fund blew up.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.171
But... well, I'm back
to Liver King levels now.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.256
At work and in the bedroom.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.429
I've been using
every inch of that Cali King.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.934
Train kept a-rollin'
all night long.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.189
Who suggested you see her?

15:40.189 --> 15:43.567
Person who hired me.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.736
<i>Have I not supported you
in our work together?</i>

15:45.736 --> 15:48.113
It isn't about that.
I am not only the work.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.908
And you can't deny your focus
is more on results than people.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.410
Dr. Mayer takes
a holistic approach.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.789
So I've heard. I didn't realize
my approach was lacking.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.166
Or that you, of all people,

15:59.166 --> 16:01.669
didn't trust me
with your whole self.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.921
How are we supposed
to move forward

16:03.921 --> 16:05.881
with that sitting between us?

16:05.881 --> 16:08.384
It isn't about trust.
Our people needed a real doctor.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.637
- And so did I.
- I am a real doctor.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.806
Technically, yes.
But I'm not sure anyone here

16:13.806 --> 16:15.224
feels comfortable
coming to you with anything

16:15.224 --> 16:16.684
besides work stuff.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.936
And Mayer creates
a very safe atmosphere.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.605
A safe feeling,
just being around her.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.029
Excuse me.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.662
How do you know she's here?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.080
Security called to let her up.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.172
Who are you here to see,
ma'am-- uh, Bonnie?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.091
Drop the bullshit, Peach.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.636
Babe, babe, babe.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.888
I've been waiting for you
to step out of those elevators

16:54.888 --> 16:56.849
since I got back here.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.853
But maybe we should talk
after work, on the down low.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.272
Jesus Christ.
I'm not here for that.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.734
- Oh, yeah. Just--
- Bonnie!

17:06.734 --> 17:08.193
What can we help you with?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.571
It's what I can help you with.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.364
Your former man
Winston is shopping

17:12.364 --> 17:14.366
a new piece of
risk-management software

17:14.366 --> 17:16.326
on the Street right now.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.078
He pitched it
at my firm this morning,

17:18.078 --> 17:19.580
and I haven't seen
the principals this excited

17:19.580 --> 17:20.748
since they were
rubbing up against me

17:20.748 --> 17:22.166
at the Christmas party.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.917
I heard he left here
just yesterday,

17:23.917 --> 17:25.127
so the timing seemed sus.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.920
Goddamnit!

17:26.920 --> 17:29.715
And on my watch. Fuck!

17:29.715 --> 17:32.301
That moonlighting prick.
Where does he get the energy?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.844
- Fuck!
- You already said "fuck."

17:33.844 --> 17:35.471
But, yeah, you're right.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.014
He must've developed this
before he left.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.892
WDE Risk Management.
What's WDE...?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.977
Winston Dick Energy.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.480
I don't espouse it, I just
know what it stands for.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.232
He said it... often.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.403
Why are you willing
to come share this with us?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.739
'Cause if there's one thing
I hate more than this place,

17:53.739 --> 17:57.868
it's backstabbing thieves,
so I had to set things right.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.578
- No, that's not it--
- Yeah, no way.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.580
Total bullshit.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.499
Fine. I'm looking for a bump
in comp at my new firm.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.209
Give me an offer
I can use as leverage,

18:05.209 --> 18:06.376
and I'll forward you
the pitch deck.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.586
- Right.
- Naturally.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.088
That's the Bonnie we know.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.422
We'll write something up
and email you.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.929
Still looking fly
in that fleece.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.601
Call me.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
What kind of AI does it use?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.447
ASI for risk mitigation.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.449
It works automatically
across all sectors

18:37.449 --> 18:39.409
to detect hidden exposure
throughout the portfolio

18:39.409 --> 18:40.786
and reduce it
through a variety

18:40.786 --> 18:42.454
of hedges
and other techniques.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.790
The edge this would
give on returns is...

18:44.790 --> 18:47.459
- considerable.
- We need it back.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.962
And to make it clear that
no one takes from us and lives.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.380
Let me be clear that,
for the record,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.464
you're speaking in metaphor.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.966
If it makes you feel better.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.134
I'll get an injunction
filed right away

18:55.134 --> 18:56.969
to stop him from shopping it.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.471
It's a work for hire.
He has no legal leg to stand on.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.849
But what about the optics
of Mike taking legal action

19:01.849 --> 19:03.976
against a former employee
in this pro-worker environment?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.645
If we don't, we run the risk
of losing the tech, full stop.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.400
Say what you're
really worried about.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.235
Reputation. Yours.
Which is of

19:13.235 --> 19:16.029
particular importance
right now. But also mine.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.948
If it becomes public that
in my early days at the helm,

19:17.948 --> 19:20.284
someone disrespected me
like this...

19:20.284 --> 19:21.827
I'd rather do this quietly.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.412
You talking
about reputation or ego?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.372
In this case,
there's no difference.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.707
I'm tied up in this
shit too, now, since he was,

19:26.707 --> 19:28.375
for a minute,
also my employee.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.626
I'll own my mistakes,
but give us a minute

19:29.626 --> 19:31.336
to make this thing right.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.629
I'm willing to gamble
and give you a minute,

19:32.629 --> 19:34.298
but not much more.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.258
Greed or fear,
which will you appeal?

19:36.258 --> 19:38.135
You really want to know?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.846
You have 48 hours, then Kate
files the injunction.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.604
I feel obliged to tell you
that you are gambling

19:48.604 --> 19:50.522
like Phil Mickelson
pressing a Nassau.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.316
It's 48 hours, Kate.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.318
And like Lefty,
I can usually make the shot.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.111
I'm not only talking about this.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.489
Ah, you delivered the Super PAC
filing to the SDNY.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.200
Yes. But I have a...

20:01.200 --> 20:03.285
low confidence interval
on the plan succeeding.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.162
Why's that?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.873
Chuck's always been as smart
as you, me, whomever else.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.293
In the past, his emotions
have allowed him to forget that.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.214
But I just... don't know
that's where we are now.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.717
Thanks.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.676
Okay.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.890
- That case did it for me.
- Hmm.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.392
Like reading a <i>Penthouse Forum</i>
in days of yore.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.561
Creative application of RICO.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.563
Real teeth there.
Instant headlines.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.607
Maybe not the kind we want. Um...

20:33.607 --> 20:35.651
Didn't feel like
lightning to me.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.530
What's so distracting?

20:41.657 --> 20:44.243
Prince Super PAC filing

20:44.243 --> 20:46.078
with the Federal
Election Commission.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.454
Anything juicy?

20:47.454 --> 20:48.914
Don't get

20:48.914 --> 20:49.915
waylaid with this right now.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.999
Let's make some cases.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.795
You know it.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.256
Amanda Torre, Securities Unit.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.674
When I get face time
with the bosses,

20:58.674 --> 21:00.342
I'm not bringing any weak shit.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.178
Oh. We speaking
our thoughts aloud, Ms. Torre?

21:03.178 --> 21:05.764
No, what I'm bringing you
is a fog-cutter,

21:05.764 --> 21:07.599
a case that's going to
make noise in the press.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.101
One that's precedent-setting,

21:09.101 --> 21:10.769
with a high-profile target
for a bad guy

21:10.769 --> 21:12.688
and victims you can
really pull for.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.356
Oh, and one with
a clear road to victory.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.191
Anything less,
and I'm wasting your time.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.111
- Quite the wish list.
- Wish granted. Here you go.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.904
Pump-and-dump scheme.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.448
<i>Wolf of Wall Street</i>
lead broker. Scuzzy lawyers.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.118
- Working people defrauded.
- She's playing all the hits.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.662
My SEC contact is ready
to formalize a complaint.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.247
The FBI and I
turned one of his traders

21:30.247 --> 21:31.415
like she was Adriana La Cerva.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.002
Well, keep her going, then.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.253
Come back
when you really have him.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.963
Right now, feels thin.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.632
I'm sorry, um...

21:40.632 --> 21:42.592
what feels thin about this?

21:42.592 --> 21:44.928
Can I get some guidance, or--

21:44.928 --> 21:48.348
Uh, where were you when He laid
the foundation of the earth?

21:48.348 --> 21:50.142
The fuck does that mean?

21:50.142 --> 21:53.312
Not to us
to question the exalted.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.401
Come on, I'll tell
you some war stories.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.572
I know the first prosecution
has a lot riding on it,

22:03.572 --> 22:05.991
but we've gotta
break the seal at some point.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.659
One should make his decisions

22:07.659 --> 22:09.578
within the space
of seven breaths.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.163
So I did.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.831
Gandhi?

22:12.831 --> 22:15.834
Uh, <i>Book of the Samurai.</i>

22:15.834 --> 22:17.669
Well... perfect

22:17.669 --> 22:19.963
is the enemy of the good.
Does it say that in there?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.506
We had a stack of winners,

22:21.506 --> 22:22.674
and that was before
Ms. Torre walked in.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.303
And she was spittin' truth.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.555
So, what more are we
looking for? Clue me in here.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.016
80 and 0, buddy.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.018
That was the
personal record at one point.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.853
And I got it
by picking the winners,

22:34.853 --> 22:36.563
not betting
the swayback nags.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.814
I know what I'm doing.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.650
You sure that's all it is?

22:43.695 --> 22:47.741
There was once an aura
amongst federal prosecutors,

22:47.741 --> 22:51.578
something noble and untouchable.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.205
It made them king-like
in their ability

22:53.205 --> 22:56.041
to either indict
or refuse to charge.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.627
Now my record earned me
a part of that,

22:58.627 --> 23:02.214
until I made some... missteps.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.883
But I'm gonna get it back.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.219
For the very honor of the job.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.845
You brought the honor back

23:08.845 --> 23:10.555
the moment you walked
into the office again.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.225
I like the office.
I can do something from it.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.354
So I can't be rash.
And I can't be emotional.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.565
And I have to pick my spots.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.025
You didn't ask me
to work by your side

23:22.025 --> 23:23.402
so I'd say
nice things to you,

23:23.402 --> 23:25.570
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.407
You're the best prosecutor
ever sat this office

23:28.407 --> 23:31.034
because you used both your
intellect and your emotions.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.078
That's why you were
80 and 0.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.915
This is a moment to take risks.
You are beloved.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.960
That's the one thing you didn't
have last time. Use it.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.545
So you don't lose it.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.255
Okay, I hear you.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.715
But that doesn't mean
I can listen to you.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.468
Not yet.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.225
Let me in on
curb-stomping Winston.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.144
Philip and I will handle it.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.980
My schedule's light, and this
is just my kind of mission.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.773
We got it. Thanks.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.122
What's with you?

24:17.122 --> 24:19.458
- Nothing.
- Nah.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.293
I saw the way you reacted
to what Winston did.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.713
It wasn't anger in those eyes.
It was sadness.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.965
Can't I be both?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.050
You steep that any longer,
you may as well suck the bag.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.970
Plus, you don't drink
herbal tea.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.388
Minor fucking detail.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.266
Though I might as well start.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.977
That's what obsolete
pensioners do, isn't it?

24:38.977 --> 24:44.065
Drink tea, stare into space,
and decompose.

24:54.201 --> 24:58.079
Mother's milk.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.832
Better than a spot of
zen-relax tea?

25:03.418 --> 25:06.588
It was a fucking eulogy, Wend.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.174
Attending my own funeral.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.177
The whole cast of <i>Liar's Poker</i>
dancing on my grave.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.930
It would've been
a lot more fun

25:14.930 --> 25:16.848
if I had gotten to fake
my own death first.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.353
This is when you throw me
some magic

25:21.353 --> 25:23.271
that unlocks everything.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.443
Maybe my magic
isn't what you need.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.697
Maybe you need to see... someone.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.659
A different kind of professional.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.286
I've given that up.
For the time being.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.041
So you're just a man
searching for his next act.

25:43.041 --> 25:47.379
I'm not looking for a next act.
I want to go back in time.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.548
You're still
the same person, Wags.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.508
It's the circumstances
around you that have changed.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.385
The kind of theatrical moves
those guys are talking about,

25:53.385 --> 25:54.761
that's in your bones.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.222
You just need to find
an opportunity

25:57.222 --> 25:59.683
that'll activate
that muscle memory.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.851
And don't wait for permission.

26:01.851 --> 26:05.730
Yes, inject that magic
into my veins.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.235
When I was talking about
a "professional" before,

26:10.235 --> 26:12.237
I meant... therapist.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.990
A real... therapist.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.908
Oh, you heard
about Dr. Mayer, then.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.037
Don't... tell me
you're seeing her too.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.165
I assure you, I prefer
those depths unplunged.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.875
Unless by you, of course.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.586
Appreciate that.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.546
So, do you know what
this chick is all about?

26:29.546 --> 26:31.464
Why they're all
so obsessed with her?

26:32.632 --> 26:34.259
The Wendy Rhoades I know

26:34.259 --> 26:37.429
does not speculate
or rely on hearsay.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.724
She dives as deep as
the fucking Mariana Trench

26:40.724 --> 26:44.436
until she finds the truth among
the supergiants at the bottom.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.939
You want to know what this
knock-off Melfi is about...

26:49.232 --> 26:50.275
go find out.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.779
And I think you know
there is nothing anyone

26:54.779 --> 26:57.157
could Freudian slip
into my drink

26:57.157 --> 27:00.201
that'll change
the fact that you...

27:00.201 --> 27:03.079
will always be my Dr. Mojo.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.091
Sir?

27:16.676 --> 27:18.678
Ms. Torre, once
I pass on a case,

27:18.678 --> 27:20.221
I don't reconsider it

27:20.221 --> 27:21.973
unless there's been some
material change.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.308
So, if that's not what
you're here to tell me...

27:23.308 --> 27:24.809
This isn't my case.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.227
This is Michael Prince's
Super PAC filing.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.646
Deputy Schirmer gave it to me,

27:27.646 --> 27:30.106
said you wanted me
to take a look.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.904
Yeah, good, great.
And, uh, what did you learn?

27:35.904 --> 27:38.239
Potential violation
of 52 USC 30121.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.824
The foreign donor ban.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.242
He wouldn't do something
that obvious.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.994
Mm, not sure and not obvious.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.455
There was an LLC that donated
called North Country.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.123
The name caught my eye,
so I ran the CEO.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.667
He appears to be
a Canadian citizen.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.629
You interested
in preparing charges?

27:52.629 --> 27:55.006
Leave what you have,
I'll-I'll give it a look.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.345
For the record, the case
I pitched is a stone winner.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.151
Been saving this one
for a special occasion--

28:15.151 --> 28:16.528
Ahh!

28:16.528 --> 28:19.406
Your return to the seat
of power.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.409
Applejack?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.953
You stopped at the joint
in the corner on your way up.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.913
It's what they had.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.581
And the thought that counts.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.710
You want to drink it or not?

28:34.254 --> 28:37.173
What a sight you are, Charles.

28:38.633 --> 28:43.304
The man back
in his natural habitat.

28:44.597 --> 28:46.891
Burning the midnight oil.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.313
Please regale me
with your first move.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.860
Nothing I'm ready to share,
I'm afraid.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.903
Don't be modest, sonny.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.240
You're sitting on something
bold and undeniable, I'm sure.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.491
Mm.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.162
What did Ira tell you?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.289
Ah, just that
you're limp as a noodle.

29:09.289 --> 29:12.208
Well, he said gun-shy,
but I'm translating.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.419
Oh, that's helpful. Thank you.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.630
- Whoa.
- Ohh.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.758
Did you know...

29:21.259 --> 29:24.637
that I stayed faithful
to your mother...

29:24.637 --> 29:27.265
for five months
after Kevin was born?

29:27.265 --> 29:29.476
Would you like
an award for that?

29:29.476 --> 29:31.060
No...

29:31.060 --> 29:33.480
I'm trying to tell you
I can relate.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.065
When I became a grandfather,

29:36.065 --> 29:39.027
I vowed to become
an upright man,

29:39.027 --> 29:41.154
an example for my grandson.

29:42.822 --> 29:46.576
God, those months
felt like years.

29:46.576 --> 29:51.080
I'd lay awake in bed next to her
every night, restless.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.792
Nothing spoils the spirit
like rote sexual congress.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.418
Dad!

29:55.418 --> 29:56.961
I knew I'd die
if I kept on like that,

29:56.961 --> 29:58.755
yet I wasn't ready for divorce.

29:58.755 --> 30:03.218
But when it came to the idea
of a new assignation...

30:04.803 --> 30:08.556
the adrenaline rush

30:08.556 --> 30:10.809
was-was almost sickening.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.603
It was like an Acapulco diver
on top of a cliff,

30:13.603 --> 30:18.817
trying to... to time the waves
so that I didn't go splat.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.070
I was utterly frozen.

30:23.696 --> 30:24.823
Until...

30:26.491 --> 30:30.787
I attended the opening
of Bedminster Golf Club.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.123
Did you ever
meet his first wife?

30:34.123 --> 30:37.001
Oh, Jesus, Dad, you didn't.

30:37.001 --> 30:42.507
That woman was an athlete.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.510
We made the beast right on
the green of the second hole.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.679
Which is all very ironic,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.515
considering where she now lies
once again, rest in peace.

30:50.515 --> 30:55.395
Okay, your story hardly
accounts for the risks I face

30:55.395 --> 30:58.815
as delightful as it is to hear
you are groin cousins

30:58.815 --> 31:01.943
- with the former Miss--
- The point is, sonny,

31:01.943 --> 31:05.530
you gotta make the leap.

31:06.823 --> 31:10.702
Because the rewards
are inestimable.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.554
<i>Sacker.</i>

31:29.554 --> 31:32.056
Kate. It's time
to go see Rhoades.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.601
Try and prompt a reaction.
Get him following the scent.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.228
- <i>Should I bring the whole team?</i>
- Sure. Good idea.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.606
Bring whomever you think
will help get the job done.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.899
<i>You got it.</i>

31:55.455 --> 31:58.416
No need to hurry.
No need to sparkle.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.920
No need to be anybody
but oneself.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.339
It's good to see you,
Dr. Rhoades.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.841
Make it Wendy.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.135
Shall we do it here, or do you
have <i>A Room of One's Own?</i>

32:12.388 --> 32:14.599
I've been expecting you.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.268
I'm sure you have.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.772
You rustle someone's cattle,
they're gonna come looking.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.275
Was it the welcoming
literary patter

32:24.275 --> 32:26.527
that helped you
snare my patients?

32:26.527 --> 32:30.907
I didn't see your brand on them.
At first.

32:30.907 --> 32:35.453
After talking to them,
the burns became more visible.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.539
Uh-huh. You know...

32:43.127 --> 32:48.007
I didn't...
come here to do this.

32:48.007 --> 32:50.134
You've helped my people
quite a lot.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.469
I wanted to thank you,

32:51.469 --> 32:54.973
and to see if we could find...

32:54.973 --> 32:58.142
a way to work in concert.
A harmony between our styles.

32:58.142 --> 33:02.981
Surely you don't think we do
the same thing, Wendy.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.817
We take different approaches,
but we're both psychiatrists.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.820
Humor me, please.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.906
How do you know
you're good at what you do?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.743
I could say close
to 25 billion earned

33:15.743 --> 33:17.286
and managed by my clients,

33:17.286 --> 33:19.622
but I won't step into that trap.

33:19.622 --> 33:23.126
My goals are aligned
with those of my patients.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.753
They want--
they need-- to earn,

33:25.753 --> 33:28.840
need to fight, need to win.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.843
The money's just a symbol of
what we're working towards.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.470
All of our shared patients,

33:34.470 --> 33:36.389
they're all addicts.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.183
What they need...

33:39.183 --> 33:42.895
it's wrapped up
in a very complicated bundle

33:42.895 --> 33:47.025
of compulsive behavior
and purpose.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.527
Your talent and insight,

33:49.527 --> 33:54.699
you use it to disguise it
all as purpose,

33:54.699 --> 33:57.535
to keep them
on a hamster wheel.

33:57.535 --> 34:01.414
Well, certainly,
the wheel may get bigger,

34:01.414 --> 34:03.666
but it's still...

34:05.084 --> 34:07.128
essentially a prison.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.921
So I'm their jailer?

34:08.921 --> 34:13.009
I don't think any of them
would agree with that.

34:13.009 --> 34:17.847
Fair.
But I can't help but think...

34:17.847 --> 34:21.517
What if you used
all your ability

34:21.517 --> 34:23.895
to free them instead?

34:23.895 --> 34:28.941
It is no secret that
you are extraordinary, Wendy.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.905
But I think you could be
even better.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.074
I would like to
help you with that.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.327
Thank you.
But I'm not in the market

34:39.327 --> 34:40.995
for a performance coach.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.663
I was suggesting therapy.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.919
Isn't that why
you're here, really?

35:02.892 --> 35:04.727
- Miss me already, huh?
- Not quite.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.313
Please, take off your shoes.
Or stay on the marble.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.773
Jesus, these carpets
are harder to clean

35:08.773 --> 35:10.441
than a frat basement couch.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.944
Bill us. We know about
WDE Risk Management.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.862
People are already
talking about it, huh?

35:14.862 --> 35:16.572
- It's gonna be huge.
- Not only did you

35:16.572 --> 35:18.407
create the software
while at MPC,

35:18.407 --> 35:20.409
meaning you're hawking property
stolen from Mike Prince,

35:20.409 --> 35:22.120
but you trained it on data
from our traders.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.579
You don't want this
to get messy with a lawsuit.

35:23.579 --> 35:24.956
Surrender the code,
we can work out

35:24.956 --> 35:26.374
a suitable position
for you at MPC.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.209
Head of Risk Management, maybe?

35:28.209 --> 35:30.795
I'm done working
for other people, thanks.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.713
And I coded WDE after I left.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.133
In the eight hours before
you started trying to sell it?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.717
Kids work quick these days,
you know that.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.136
That isn't going
to hold up in court.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.887
Please. I used
an air-gapped computer,

35:39.887 --> 35:41.639
so the code trail
supports my timeline.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.224
I mean, I would've,
if I'd done it

35:43.224 --> 35:45.143
while I was still at MPC.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.436
But look, I'm a generous dude,
and we're friends.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.773
So I'll license it to you for
only, like, $500,000 per month.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.609
Plus two percent of profits.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.444
Oh, come on, shoes!
Who's been putting out

35:55.444 --> 35:56.654
their Kools on my floor?!

35:56.654 --> 35:58.197
I told you we've got this, Wags.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.740
I'm not asking permission.
Taylor, Philip,

35:59.740 --> 36:01.159
back away
from the defendant.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.577
Prince is moving
forward with the lawsuit.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.370
This negotiation is
as useless as

36:04.370 --> 36:06.372
a 20-year-old
lambskin rubber.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.790
Like from a real lamb?

36:07.790 --> 36:09.667
Get off me--

36:09.667 --> 36:13.004
Do you think anyone on the
Street is gonna license software

36:13.004 --> 36:14.964
under the absolute
mountain of legal caca

36:14.964 --> 36:16.591
we're throwing your way?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.634
Your product, along
with your bank accounts,

36:18.634 --> 36:22.471
are gonna be frozen like
Ted Williams's fuckin' head!

36:30.521 --> 36:32.315
I can't believe
Prince called you in.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.150
- He promised us some time.
- He didn't call me in.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.318
The lawsuit
hasn't been filed yet.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.694
A bluff. What's the play?

36:36.694 --> 36:38.196
You can't eradicate cockroaches

36:38.196 --> 36:40.364
without scaring them
out of hiding.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.541
<i>Yeah, hi.
I need to talk to your COO.</i>

36:50.541 --> 36:52.376
<i>I met with him yesterday.
We need to fast track</i>

36:52.376 --> 36:53.711
<i>the software
licensing agreements,</i>

36:53.711 --> 36:55.129
<i>or the offer's going away.</i>

36:57.715 --> 36:59.425
Do you think
anyone on the Street

36:59.425 --> 37:01.010
is gonna license software

37:01.010 --> 37:02.845
under the absolute
mountain of legal caca

37:02.845 --> 37:04.472
we're throwing your way?

37:04.472 --> 37:06.599
Your product, along
with your bank accounts,

37:06.599 --> 37:10.269
are gonna be frozen like
Ted Williams's fuckin' head!

37:14.649 --> 37:16.651
They had us wait in here
instead of in Chuck's office

37:16.651 --> 37:18.110
so that they could
end the conversation

37:18.110 --> 37:19.153
by walking out
whenever they want,

37:19.153 --> 37:20.863
treating us like targets.

37:20.863 --> 37:23.407
It's amazing the lessons
you choose to remember.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.785
Oh, I remember all of them.
Deploy the most effective

37:25.785 --> 37:27.119
and let the rest dangle.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.829
Which are you deploying today?

37:28.829 --> 37:32.250
We're here because
we have the same goal:

37:32.250 --> 37:34.418
for my candidate to be
operating squeaky clean,

37:34.418 --> 37:36.879
behind glass so clear,
it kills birds.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.006
The PAC is just
that transparent.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.509
We assume you've already
reviewed our FEC disclosure.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.094
We're here to answer
any questions.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.762
I guess it's
the "show up voluntarily

37:44.762 --> 37:46.889
to appear innocent" lesson,
but our policy

37:46.889 --> 37:49.433
is to ask questions
on our schedule, not yours.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.019
Eh, no, I do have one, actually.
For all of them.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.938
One I've asked Scooter before:

37:53.938 --> 37:57.275
What's the going price for
one's soul these days? Hmm?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.193
Well, a lesson from
my side of the street

37:59.193 --> 38:00.987
is never answer
a hypothetical.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.947
So, since I'm the guy
with no history here,

38:02.947 --> 38:05.992
might I suggest we turn this
slightly professional.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.868
Mr. Rhoades,
we sent over the documents

38:07.868 --> 38:09.870
so you'd have
an opportunity to vet them.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.872
That seemed the best way
for all parties to ensure

38:11.872 --> 38:15.042
that an often dirty process
is as pure as Crater Lake.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.546
Yes, well, the lake is pure
because it isn't

38:18.546 --> 38:20.172
fed by any rivers and streams,

38:20.172 --> 38:22.133
so there's no opportunity
for pollution--

38:22.133 --> 38:24.302
the opposite of
a fucking Super PAC,

38:24.302 --> 38:25.886
which tries to onboard as many

38:25.886 --> 38:27.638
dirty streams of cash
as possible.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.814
But...

38:36.814 --> 38:39.483
I won't know the specifics
until I take a look.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.069
And the fact is, I haven't
even had a chance yet.

38:42.069 --> 38:45.823
- Really.
- Really.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.992
It's what the man said.
It's what the man meant.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.328
And when I do,
if I have questions,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.330
you will be hearing from me.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.096
That was an opportunity.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.431
This is.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.060
You know what
Amanda found in that filing.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.645
- Let's hit 'em.
- This is not our shot at Prince.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.898
What are you doing?

39:18.898 --> 39:21.359
I'm being smart.
Restrained. Tactical.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.694
Bullshit, buddy.
This is fear.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.322
Oh, come on.
You saw them, baiting me.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.366
They want me to find something,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.743
for some reason not yet obvious.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.662
But what is clear is that
all this would end, at minimum,

39:33.662 --> 39:35.206
with egg on my face.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.833
My dignity--
that, I will not lose.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.753
Your dignity? Chuck,
this isn't just about you.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.505
I'm sorry
I pulled you away

39:42.505 --> 39:43.839
from the high-dollar chase.

39:43.839 --> 39:45.049
You already miss it that much

39:45.049 --> 39:46.300
you're ready to go back?

39:47.843 --> 39:50.221
No. And it's not just about me.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.555
There's an office
full of people out there

39:51.555 --> 39:53.349
putting forth
their best efforts.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.810
So that's on the line.
And their careers, too.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.729
When they woke up to the news
that you were going to return,

39:58.729 --> 40:00.356
they all told themselves

40:00.356 --> 40:01.899
they were finally
gonna be able to do something.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.234
They'd finally live up to
the essays

40:03.234 --> 40:05.194
they wrote
to get into law school

40:05.194 --> 40:07.405
because they'd finally
be working for a great man.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.243
And I know this to be true.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.412
Okay, so the only one
who needs to remember is you.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.135
Hey.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.762
If someone lusts
after you every day,

40:31.762 --> 40:33.931
they probably
also make moves.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.142
Maybe moves they shouldn't,

40:36.142 --> 40:39.562
to impress, ingratiate, seduce?

40:39.562 --> 40:41.814
Hopefully... illegal ones.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.941
So, what were they?

40:43.941 --> 40:45.776
I don't want Winston's

40:45.776 --> 40:47.778
metaphorical death
on my conscience.

40:47.778 --> 40:48.946
He was like
my annoying little brother.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.698
I'm not gonna be a part of this.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.783
Do you understand that
getting that software back

40:52.783 --> 40:55.327
is the single most important
thing to MPC right now?

40:55.327 --> 40:58.497
It's either him or us.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.959
Okay.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.128
He bragged about
some hacktivist stuff,

41:04.128 --> 41:07.047
but I honestly didn't listen
when he talked most of the time.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.133
He was probably just
making shit up to impress me.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.301
Hm.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.555
- But...
- But what?

41:16.182 --> 41:19.643
Okay, I didn't ask him to do it.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.771
But last May,
Winston hacked the DMV

41:22.771 --> 41:25.357
to remove points from my license
when I was about to lose it.

41:25.357 --> 41:28.194
How many points did you have?

41:28.194 --> 41:30.613
I like to go fast.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.657
That's my girl.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.495
I gonna need the date and time
of that hack for my guy.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.294
I sent some of our gang in
to talk to Chuck.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.046
The theory being?

41:47.046 --> 41:49.632
That he's coming for me.
I want to know from where.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.051
- And now you do?
- I do not.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.512
They said he seemed
different, muted.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.264
Disinterested even.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.808
Their instinct is
he's not coming.

41:59.808 --> 42:02.478
Was that just a posture?
I'm not sure.

42:02.478 --> 42:06.524
Could be he has other things
to focus on in his new job.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.192
He wouldn't be alone in that.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.821
You'd rather talk about
why I have a need to know,

42:12.821 --> 42:14.615
why I'm engaged in that

42:14.615 --> 42:16.951
instead of keeping my eyes
forward on my own business.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.203
I don't want to get into
anything you don't want to.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.038
And if I asked you to go in?

42:21.038 --> 42:23.207
To talk to Chuck,

42:23.207 --> 42:25.793
have a look for yourself,

42:25.793 --> 42:28.212
see what's going on
and give me some guidance?

42:28.212 --> 42:30.714
I'd say no way, bad idea.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.550
Any more contact,
and he's going to start

42:32.550 --> 42:34.343
believing there's
something there.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.262
You don't want to convert
your search for intel

42:36.262 --> 42:37.721
into motivation for him, do you?

42:39.223 --> 42:40.391
I do not.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.018
Good call.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.742
Hm.

43:01.662 --> 43:02.788
Here.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.089
I figured
the one you had was old.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.382
You should have a current one.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.009
Yeah, well, the one I have,

43:15.009 --> 43:16.844
they're much younger.
You're in it.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.681
Thank you.

43:20.681 --> 43:23.100
I heard some people from
the firm paid a visit today.

43:23.100 --> 43:25.603
And yet, I didn't
like what I learned.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.856
Anytime I hear Chuck Rhoades
is muted instead of pugnacious,

43:28.856 --> 43:30.274
it's cause for worry.

43:30.274 --> 43:33.402
You don't worry, you dig.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.862
Wh-what are you digging for now?

43:34.862 --> 43:36.530
Nothing.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.616
I just don't like
the cooled-off version of you.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.118
Pot, kettle, Wend.
You've been frozen so long,

43:41.118 --> 43:44.121
the very temperature of the room
drops when you walk in.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.456
Did Prince send you?

43:45.456 --> 43:48.125
He's not sweating
his disclosure.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.170
Besides, if he had,
would I have come?

43:51.170 --> 43:52.671
Am I some errand girl?

43:52.671 --> 43:55.424
No, I suppose not.

43:55.424 --> 43:59.303
Though I don't know
what you are.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.222
I just hope whatever
you're doing here

44:02.222 --> 44:04.183
works out okay
for them this time.

44:08.812 --> 44:11.482
You got to the kid.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.568
He called them all,
so we've got the list.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.988
Two firms that he approached
yesterday, three today.

44:17.988 --> 44:20.449
Deals are being drawn up.

44:20.449 --> 44:24.244
He set a follow-up presentation
at his co-working space

44:24.244 --> 44:26.455
with all five CEOs tomorrow.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.749
Plan is to
ink the contracts there

44:28.749 --> 44:31.001
before any lawsuits land on him.

44:32.544 --> 44:36.173
Bravissimo, Hall.
And the coding signature?

44:37.466 --> 44:39.927
Hell of a laundry list,
you were right.

44:41.387 --> 44:42.513
That's the one.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.849
You want to bury him like that?

44:45.849 --> 44:48.894
Damn right.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.771
This is the fucking shovel.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.524
Now let's put on a show.

45:01.365 --> 45:03.283
I don't regret keeping
them on the hamster wheel.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.035
That's my job,

45:05.035 --> 45:07.204
to keep personnel in place,
happy enough to deliver.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.541
But I didn't choose
that wheel for myself.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.168
And yet...

45:14.420 --> 45:16.588
you want to know...

45:16.588 --> 45:20.175
why you can't leave.

45:20.175 --> 45:24.680
I want to know why I sometimes
feel like an errand girl.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.390
I know I'm not, but...

45:28.183 --> 45:29.727
Also, I kind of am.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.437
I keep doing
other people's bidding.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.857
You know, I can leave.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.568
- It's just that I don't.
- Mm-hmm.

45:37.568 --> 45:41.572
There's nothing stopping me,
contractual or financial.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.574
I tell myself it's
the fate of those very people

45:43.574 --> 45:45.325
that I'm keeping on the wheel,

45:45.325 --> 45:46.994
and the fate of
a great many people beyond,

45:46.994 --> 45:49.246
as well, that won't let me go.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.248
So...

45:51.248 --> 45:54.209
you're either an errand girl

45:54.209 --> 45:58.255
or Christ-like in your desire
to serve the wastrels.

45:58.255 --> 46:00.466
Feeling their pain.
Making it your own.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.884
You salve them.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.720
And ready them, again,

46:04.720 --> 46:07.264
to put their souls in peril.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.309
I... I don't know.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.855
I just know you were right.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.816
I can be more than this.

46:17.816 --> 46:18.984
I have to be.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.947
And I want to start that work.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.365
That's wonderful.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.368
I'll get you some referrals.

46:28.368 --> 46:31.914
No, no. You break it,
you buy it, Eleanor.

46:31.914 --> 46:35.209
That's what you think?
That I broke you?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.461
No. I'm not gonna
give you that much credit. Yet.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.130
But you did show me that
whatever it was I'm clinging to

46:40.130 --> 46:42.966
to stay above water
is drowning me instead.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.720
That's why it has to be you.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.140
Having started
at odds like this,

46:50.140 --> 46:52.017
it isn't ideal.

46:56.855 --> 46:59.650
Neither is the human condition,
yet we continue to lump it.

47:31.223 --> 47:34.142
I've already had a night, Karl.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.853
What's so important
I had to haul it

47:35.853 --> 47:37.729
all the way up to 122nd?

47:41.400 --> 47:44.111
Ah!

47:44.111 --> 47:46.530
So this is
an intervention, then.

47:46.530 --> 47:50.033
That's why you brought me
to the final resting place

47:50.033 --> 47:52.327
of Ulysses S. Grant.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.706
To remind me that
the venerated Union general

47:55.706 --> 47:58.542
stood tall
after the loss at Shiloh.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.710
Right?

48:01.169 --> 48:02.713
And what did
Lincoln say to those

48:02.713 --> 48:04.423
calling for his removal?

48:04.423 --> 48:08.886
"I can't spare this man;
he fights."

48:10.679 --> 48:13.056
Yeah, where would we be
if Grant hadn't gone on

48:13.056 --> 48:15.726
to fight at Chattanooga
and Vicksburg?

48:18.020 --> 48:20.439
You hoped this would
awaken my fight.

48:21.523 --> 48:23.191
But fighting is not my problem.

48:23.191 --> 48:27.404
I am ready to fight.
I am not ready to lose.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.491
Not again.

48:31.491 --> 48:33.285
You're a great man.

48:33.285 --> 48:35.245
But that isn't why
we've asked you to meet.

48:35.245 --> 48:37.414
The reason's inside.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.393
Well, that's
one hell of a twist.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.362
Hey there, Chuck.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.696
Well...

49:11.657 --> 49:13.241
It's nice to meet you, sir.

49:13.241 --> 49:14.660
Uh...

49:14.660 --> 49:17.037
I've long held you
in admiration.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.289
I hear you've got
a case of the yips, my man.

49:19.289 --> 49:20.707
The yips.

49:20.707 --> 49:23.877
Yeah, I wish it was the yips.

49:23.877 --> 49:28.757
It's elemental. My next move
needs to be perfect.

49:28.757 --> 49:30.801
I need a win.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.386
I'm familiar with that pressure.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.096
Well, you mastered it.

49:34.096 --> 49:36.348
You learned to use
the pressure to serve you.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.600
Your record's beyond compare.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.143
Well, you know,
Coach Wooden said that

49:40.143 --> 49:41.895
as long as you do
your personal best,

49:41.895 --> 49:44.481
- you've won.
- And that worked for you?

49:44.481 --> 49:45.899
For a while.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.818
And then we made
a trip down to Houston

49:47.818 --> 49:50.404
- to visit Mr. Hayes.
- That's understood.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.322
And it destroyed your
perfect season.

49:52.322 --> 49:54.408
- Must've been devastating.
- Yeah, I was rocked.

49:54.408 --> 49:55.492
Yeah.

49:55.492 --> 49:57.411
But that loss made me.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.579
- Mm-hmm.
- It helped...

49:59.579 --> 50:01.832
make me into the player
that I wanted to be.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.625
- Yeah.
- And of course,

50:03.625 --> 50:05.669
when the tournament came around,

50:05.669 --> 50:07.838
it really made it sweet
to kick their asses.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.507
Yeah, but...

50:10.507 --> 50:12.009
the fear getting there.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.844
I mean, how do you
keep that at bay?

50:15.554 --> 50:20.183
I grew up in 1960s America
looking like this.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.977
People wanted to kill me.

50:21.977 --> 50:24.813
I've battled leukemia,
open heart surgery,

50:24.813 --> 50:27.816
cancer, fire, and racism.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.362
You think I'd ever be afraid
of missing a damn skyhook

50:32.362 --> 50:33.530
after all of that?

50:33.530 --> 50:36.033
I do not imagine you would. No.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.534
Yeah. Right.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.869
Chuck...

50:40.120 --> 50:42.164
people like us keep after it

50:42.164 --> 50:43.874
because we know

50:43.874 --> 50:46.293
it's a crime
to waste what we have.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.880
If we don't take the shot...

50:49.880 --> 50:52.257
who the hell else will?

51:07.189 --> 51:10.233
This is why you need...

51:15.614 --> 51:17.991
WDE.

51:21.453 --> 51:23.413
Wait. What are you doing here?

51:23.413 --> 51:25.165
We heard there was
gonna be a show.

51:33.632 --> 51:37.761
Winston, This is Your Life.

51:37.761 --> 51:40.430
The fuck?
You hijacked my presentation--

51:40.430 --> 51:42.641
You were born in 1989

51:42.641 --> 51:46.394
in Ardsley, New York,
to parents Freddie and Carlene.

51:46.394 --> 51:47.979
Excelled in school.
Then to MIT,

51:47.979 --> 51:50.273
where you had your first
and only girlfriend.

51:50.273 --> 51:52.067
But she dumped you.
I wonder why that was.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.652
- I...
- Perhaps

51:53.652 --> 51:55.612
your internet search history
has the answers.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.080
Also while in Beantown,

52:05.080 --> 52:06.915
you hacked the College Board
to change the SAT scores

52:06.915 --> 52:08.583
of Boston Latin students.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.461
You're so good,
Winston. Do you know that?

52:11.461 --> 52:13.797
So singular in your talent

52:13.797 --> 52:16.883
that your coding signature
is unique.

52:16.883 --> 52:18.635
Immediately identifiable.

52:18.635 --> 52:20.929
- Oh, fuck!
- That's right!

52:20.929 --> 52:22.556
And we found that
it's been used to hack

52:22.556 --> 52:24.307
several government agencies.

52:24.307 --> 52:26.560
This includes a NATO breach

52:26.560 --> 52:29.146
in which a gigabyte
of classified information

52:29.146 --> 52:33.316
was stolen and posted online
to prove NATO's vulnerabilities.

52:33.316 --> 52:36.319
Heroic in some lights,

52:36.319 --> 52:38.697
but fucking illegal
in all others.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.199
That attack was attributed to
the group which you, Winston,

52:41.199 --> 52:44.536
have been part of
for at least a decade.

52:44.536 --> 52:46.705
I-- Where did you get this?

52:46.705 --> 52:48.039
Rian rolled on your ass.

52:48.039 --> 52:50.542
Kid...

52:50.542 --> 52:53.170
I know how it feels to have
your purpose

52:53.170 --> 52:55.130
sucked out from beneath you.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.507
But let us point
to the road back.

52:57.507 --> 52:59.050
You will surrender
the software immediately,

52:59.050 --> 53:01.219
as it is the property of
Michael Prince Capital,

53:01.219 --> 53:04.681
or all this goes very,
very public. Like, FBI public.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.933
But cooperate,
and MPC will license

53:06.933 --> 53:08.310
a lesser version to
the rest of the Street.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.686
Keeping the best for us,
of course.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.188
And you can run it.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.439
I think that's
the better choice.

53:12.439 --> 53:13.857
That isn't a real choice.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.317
Isn't pretending
beneath you, Taylor?

53:15.317 --> 53:16.860
You're right.
There is no choice.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.862
You have five minutes
before your customers

53:18.862 --> 53:20.655
start arriving for the pitch.

53:20.655 --> 53:22.949
So... pull yourself together, DocuSign,

53:22.949 --> 53:25.452
and pitch the shit out of them,
or we have calls to make.

53:27.579 --> 53:31.458
Oh, and we've renamed it.
Trojan Defense.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.877
Winston Dick Energy
is a name only a man

53:33.877 --> 53:37.005
with a very, very, small
energy source would choose.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.383
It's... around
the national average.

53:45.430 --> 53:47.724
Utterly brutal, Wags.
I mean that as a compliment.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.935
Wouldn't take it any other way.

53:49.935 --> 53:52.562
And please, spread this tale
far and wide.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.231
To anyone who will listen.

54:05.325 --> 54:06.952
Time to send a message.

54:06.952 --> 54:09.579
The PAC is, as we said,
likely a misdirect.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.706
All signs point to him
self-funding.

54:11.706 --> 54:15.210
Mm. But let's open an
investigation on Michael Prince

54:15.210 --> 54:18.213
for conspiring to violate
the ban on foreign donations

54:18.213 --> 54:19.589
and contributions in connection

54:19.589 --> 54:21.258
with federal
and state elections.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.593
Use it as cover
to find another way in.

54:23.593 --> 54:27.013
He needs to think he's got me
running in the wrong direction.

54:27.013 --> 54:28.807
It will be done.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.104
- Our boy is back.
- Beautiful thing.

54:47.659 --> 54:49.744
When last we spoke,

54:49.744 --> 54:52.914
I said I didn't want to get
into anything that you didn't.

54:52.914 --> 54:54.582
But if you don't want
to get into something,

54:54.582 --> 54:56.960
that's exactly
where I need to take you.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.088
Otherwise, I'm failing you.

55:00.088 --> 55:02.465
And I'm sorry
I did that before.

55:02.465 --> 55:04.426
Understood. Thank you.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.681
Chuck Rhoades is charging us
for violations on the Super PAC.

55:09.681 --> 55:11.891
Good. Good.

55:11.891 --> 55:14.519
Do we have the CEO's
citizenship paperwork in hand?

55:14.519 --> 55:16.730
We do. Granted the same day
as the donation,

55:16.730 --> 55:18.481
so it's not even
in the system yet.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.608
Game on, then.

55:20.608 --> 55:22.485
Nothing for him
at the end of that road.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.168
What are all these?

55:38.168 --> 55:41.671
Cases that are winners
but don't matter.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.341
A once-vaunted lawman
called prosecutors

55:44.341 --> 55:45.967
that only go after these, quote,

55:45.967 --> 55:48.303
"members of
the chickenshit club."

55:48.303 --> 55:50.805
Not a club I want to join.

55:50.805 --> 55:52.640
Not one you'll have to

55:52.640 --> 55:55.185
because we are going
after the ones that do matter,

55:55.185 --> 55:57.896
starting with your
pump-and-dump case.

55:57.896 --> 55:59.981
- You ready?
- More than.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.526
You know, there's something
you'll have to learn

56:03.526 --> 56:06.321
going after the important ones:

56:06.321 --> 56:08.573
really fucking
hurts to lose.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.453
Chips away pieces of you
each time.

56:13.453 --> 56:17.248
Pieces you don't get back.

56:17.248 --> 56:20.877
And it leaves you with no
choice but to...

56:20.877 --> 56:22.837
go forward incomplete.

56:24.714 --> 56:27.801
But, what, you're
all the better for it?

56:27.801 --> 56:29.094
Stronger and whatnot?

56:30.261 --> 56:31.388
No.

56:33.014 --> 56:36.559
You just go forward
like that, missing pieces.

56:38.269 --> 56:40.230
Because that's
the way you are now

56:40.230 --> 56:41.981
and there's no other choice.

56:41.981 --> 56:45.402
- Fuck.
- Mm-hmm.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.904
But that's not something
to worry about today.

56:47.904 --> 56:50.907
Because before all that
stuff-of-life happens,

56:50.907 --> 56:53.326
we are gonna
win cases aplenty.

56:53.326 --> 56:56.329
I goddamn guarantee you that.

57:01.751 --> 57:05.505
<i>A world without heroes</i>

57:05.505 --> 57:08.675
<i>Is like a world without sun</i>

57:08.675 --> 57:11.845
<i>You can't look up to anyone</i>

57:11.845 --> 57:13.555
<i>Without heroes</i>

57:14.764 --> 57:17.642
<i>A world without heroes</i>

57:17.642 --> 57:21.312
<i>Is like a never-ending race</i>

57:21.312 --> 57:25.275
<i>Is like a time
Without a place</i>

57:25.275 --> 57:29.404
<i>A pointless thing,
Devoid of grace</i>

57:29.404 --> 57:33.616
<i>Where you don't know
What you're after</i>

57:33.616 --> 57:37.912
<i>Or if something's after you</i>

57:37.912 --> 57:41.791
<i>And you don't know
Why you don't know</i>

57:41.791 --> 57:44.461
<i>In a world without heroes</i>

57:47.839 --> 57:50.633
<i>In a world
Without dreams...</i>
