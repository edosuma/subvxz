00:22.273 --> 00:25.819
My name is Te Ata,

00:26.027 --> 00:29.948
bearer of the morning.

00:30.156 --> 00:35.704
I am Chickasaw and storyteller

00:35.912 --> 00:38.790
and this is my story.

00:45.338 --> 00:48.800
There are horses of many colors,

00:49.009 --> 00:52.804
brown, black, yellow, white,

00:53.013 --> 00:57.183
yet they're all one horse.

00:57.392 --> 01:01.604
There are birds of many colors,

01:01.813 --> 01:06.276
red, blue, green, yellow,

01:06.484 --> 01:10.822
yet they are all one bird.

01:11.031 --> 01:15.869
So with cattle, so with
all living things,

01:16.077 --> 01:23.626
so with men, and this land,
where one was only Indians,

01:23.835 --> 01:30.133
are men of every color, yet
they're all one people.

01:30.341 --> 01:34.095
That this should come to
pass was at the heart of

01:34.304 --> 01:36.931
the great mystery.

01:44.564 --> 01:45.774
And I solemnly promise,

01:45.982 --> 01:48.651
as a duly elected governor
of the Chickasaw Nation,

01:48.860 --> 01:51.905
that each man, woman, and child

01:52.113 --> 01:56.201
will have a homestead
of 320 acres.

01:58.453 --> 01:59.453
It is my pride...

02:00.080 --> 02:01.372
Hi, Uncle Doug!

02:02.707 --> 02:05.877
And ambition of my life
to aid in securing

02:06.086 --> 02:09.672
the happiness and
prosperity of our people

02:11.508 --> 02:14.385
and to receive the
plaudits, congratulations,

02:14.594 --> 02:16.554
and goodwill of our guardians,

02:16.763 --> 02:19.432
the United States government.

02:29.776 --> 02:32.654
Eugene, run ahead and get
the wagon situated, okay?

02:32.862 --> 02:34.131
Now, Mary Frances,
your daddy and I have

02:34.155 --> 02:35.555
a party in honor of
your Uncle Doug.

02:35.579 --> 02:36.699
But I want to go!

02:36.908 --> 02:38.828
It's for grown ups, and I
know you think you are,

02:38.852 --> 02:39.536
but you are not.

02:39.744 --> 02:40.453
Now, you go on
with your brother,

02:40.622 --> 02:41.902
and he and Celina are in charge.

02:41.926 --> 02:43.081
You hear me?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.059
And you need to be helping your
sister put baby Gladys down,

02:45.083 --> 02:47.293
and I don't want you back
talking or running off.

02:47.502 --> 02:49.129
You hear me?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.964
Where?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.632
Mary Frances!

02:53.508 --> 02:54.748
Now I've been meaning to ask...

02:54.843 --> 02:55.635
How you doing?

02:55.844 --> 02:58.930
What do you think
about treasurer?

02:59.139 --> 03:01.182
But I don't know
anything about politics.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.391
Exactly.

03:02.475 --> 03:04.018
An honest man.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.020
Hey, whoa, whoa!

03:06.229 --> 03:07.230
Not so fast.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.773
Now, who's this
little whirlwind?

03:08.982 --> 03:10.024
Hi, Uncle Doug.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.236
Mary Frances, don't be
bothering the governor.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.696
No, it's all right.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.407
Uncle Doug, can't you pass a
law so I can come tonight?

03:17.615 --> 03:20.827
Hard to say no to such a
charming constituent.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.704
But you'd be bored
silly in there.

03:22.912 --> 03:23.496
Now let's go find your brother,

03:23.705 --> 03:24.705
and no more running.

03:25.081 --> 03:26.374
No!

03:26.583 --> 03:28.877
That's a special little
girl you got there, TB.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.421
Yeah.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.631
What we're doing in this
building most of all

03:33.840 --> 03:37.427
is protecting their future.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.308
Then you're going to
need a good treasurer.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.018
Your office is upstairs.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.770
It's the one with your
name on the door.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.954
In the beginning, everything
was covered with water.

04:05.163 --> 04:07.624
The only living were
a few small animals,

04:07.832 --> 04:10.126
afloat on a raft.

04:10.335 --> 04:13.755
Not knowing what to do,
the crayfish volunteered

04:13.963 --> 04:17.216
and dove off the raft
into the great ocean.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.219
He tried every day
to reach the bottom,

04:19.427 --> 04:22.305
and on the fourth day, he did.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.059
He built a great mud
chimney that stuck up

04:26.267 --> 04:28.603
above the surface of the water.

04:28.811 --> 04:32.649
The mud spread out and created
a newly formed Earth.

04:32.857 --> 04:35.360
It is from this mud chimney
that the Chickasaw

04:35.568 --> 04:38.696
and the Choctaw people were
allowed to come and live upon

04:38.905 --> 04:40.949
the new surface with
all the animals.

05:29.289 --> 05:30.748
Oh!

05:30.957 --> 05:31.582
Would you mind putting her down?

05:31.791 --> 05:32.959
I got dinner boiling.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.128
Avis.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.171
What's a matter, sugarplum?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.756
Oh.

05:40.466 --> 05:41.466
Where's Gladys?

05:41.634 --> 05:42.635
Is she still sleeping?

05:42.844 --> 05:43.636
Yeah.

05:43.845 --> 05:44.929
You seen Mary?

05:45.138 --> 05:46.556
She not back from school?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.558
No.

05:51.436 --> 05:53.604
What's them eggs about?

05:54.314 --> 05:56.065
Mrs. Bernstein paid with them.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.274
Again?

05:57.442 --> 05:58.962
Thomas, you hear that
cackling outside?

05:58.986 --> 06:00.070
We got our own chickens.

06:00.279 --> 06:01.863
We got plenty of eggs.

06:02.030 --> 06:03.510
She's got a new mouth
to feed, Bertie.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.658
It's tough on her.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.120
How was work?

06:09.329 --> 06:11.622
Cash strapped.

06:11.831 --> 06:12.831
The store or the nation?

06:12.999 --> 06:14.250
Both.

06:14.303 --> 06:16.103
Johnson wants to start
charging ranchers a fee

06:16.127 --> 06:17.127
for grazing on our land.

06:17.295 --> 06:18.087
It's about time.

06:18.283 --> 06:19.523
He's going to go to Washington,

06:19.547 --> 06:21.027
get our funds released
for the school.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.258
That's good.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.134
Schooling's the only way
our kids are going to

06:23.343 --> 06:24.503
make something of themselves.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.138
Hope them funds
included interest.

06:36.481 --> 06:38.316
A tornado's a-coming.

06:41.861 --> 06:42.945
Where were you?

06:43.154 --> 06:45.656
Uh, listening to the corn grow.

06:45.865 --> 06:46.240
Look at you.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.449
You are filthy.

06:47.492 --> 06:48.772
And where are your school books?

06:48.796 --> 06:50.131
I can't run with
them books, Mama.

06:50.203 --> 06:51.563
Well, you can't
study without them,

06:51.771 --> 06:53.648
and now you're making
me and your daddy late.

06:53.857 --> 06:54.957
Can I come?

06:55.166 --> 06:57.085
No, you're going to
your sister's house.

06:57.293 --> 06:58.795
Celina's house is boring.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.003
I want to go with you.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.129
Well, you're too young.

07:01.297 --> 07:03.174
But I'm two hands old!

07:03.383 --> 07:04.926
You're how old?

07:05.134 --> 07:06.427
Two hands.

07:06.636 --> 07:07.720
Thumbs included?

07:07.929 --> 07:09.097
Yep.

07:09.305 --> 07:10.014
Okay, then.

07:10.223 --> 07:11.343
You get yourself cleaned up.

07:11.391 --> 07:12.975
Okay!

07:14.977 --> 07:16.354
She's ready.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.161
We are all sparks
from Ababinili.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.791
He scatters us out here
and there to make light.

07:40.211 --> 07:43.214
And when we die,
he gathers us up,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.301
so as to make one big blaze

07:50.138 --> 07:52.974
to show us the house
of Ababinili.

08:15.997 --> 08:21.836
No one's allowed between the
elder and the fire, ever.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.922
Ishnaakoot
shikonno'pa'ishanooli.

08:25.131 --> 08:25.673
I'm sorry.

08:25.882 --> 08:26.882
What'd he say, Daddy?

08:26.966 --> 08:29.927
Ishnaakoot
shikonno'pa'ishanooli.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.457
What can we do for
you, Johnston?

08:59.665 --> 09:01.584
Our funds that you
hold in trust,

09:01.792 --> 09:03.586
I need them released to
the Chickasaw people

09:03.794 --> 09:05.505
so we can invest in education.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.633
Ah, and so that's what
this is all about,

09:08.841 --> 09:11.260
wanting more money from the U.S.
government?

09:11.469 --> 09:13.137
I am trying to help my people.

09:13.346 --> 09:15.598
And we are trying
to build a nation,

09:16.599 --> 09:20.811
which we hope will
include your people,

09:21.020 --> 09:23.231
after they assimilate,
of course.

09:23.439 --> 09:26.359
If you can't beat 'em,
might as well join 'em.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.986
Which brings me to
another matter,

09:29.195 --> 09:32.740
the code of Indian offenses.

09:32.949 --> 09:35.076
And what of the
Indians, Senator,

09:35.284 --> 09:37.119
do you find so offensive?

09:37.328 --> 09:39.664
We can't have
Americans engaging in

09:39.872 --> 09:43.918
unsavory activities that the U.S.
deems illegal.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.294
Unsavory activities?

09:45.503 --> 09:48.339
Pagan dances, witch
doctor rituals.

09:48.548 --> 09:51.175
No tribal mumbo-jumbo.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.719
Come on now, Johnston, don't
you want to pull your people

09:53.928 --> 09:55.555
up out of the dark ages?

09:55.763 --> 09:59.725
Imagine, one day, with
proper governing,

09:59.934 --> 10:04.438
the Indian acting, looking
just like the white man,

10:04.647 --> 10:06.732
one nation under God,

10:06.941 --> 10:09.777
not several nations
under numerous gods.

10:09.986 --> 10:11.786
Senator Judd, we have
dealt with the white man

10:11.821 --> 10:13.906
for over 350 years.

10:14.115 --> 10:17.159
We dress like the white
man, attend church,

10:17.368 --> 10:19.704
educate our children
in schools as good,

10:19.912 --> 10:23.165
if not better, than any
state in the union.

10:23.374 --> 10:25.501
We have done all that the U.S.
government

10:25.710 --> 10:27.253
has asked of us.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.881
In return, we only ask
that our funds be released

10:31.090 --> 10:33.217
so we can continue to
provide for our people.

10:33.426 --> 10:35.511
We will have a committee
look into that matter.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.848
Oh, yes, just as soon as
we're back in session.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.392
We are a patient people.

10:41.601 --> 10:46.439
We will get what is ours,
even if it takes 100 years.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.815
Good day, gentlemen.

10:48.399 --> 10:51.861
My advice to you, Governor,

10:52.069 --> 10:54.947
join the American spirit
of entrepreneurship.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.283
Don't look for handouts.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.410
No, no, let your people
pull themselves up

10:59.619 --> 11:03.289
by their bootstraps
and join the future,

11:03.497 --> 11:04.874
like the rest of us have.

11:05.082 --> 11:09.629
I assure you, sir, my people do
not need lessons in hard work,

11:09.837 --> 11:13.549
grit, or making a
living off the land.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.217
Good day.

11:32.318 --> 11:39.408
Well, went about the
way we expected.

11:39.617 --> 11:43.537
By all that is sacred,
what do they want of us?

11:43.746 --> 11:47.667
Not to exist.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.419
We've got a history of that.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.147
I'm afraid it looks like
we might have to move

11:52.171 --> 11:53.631
out of the Capitol Building, TB.

11:53.839 --> 11:54.590
I don't know what we're
going to do now.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.384
It's not just us, Governor.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.259
A lot of people have been

11:57.468 --> 11:58.552
bet on that life.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.054
We'll figure something out.

12:05.685 --> 12:09.230
My daddy told stories
of our trail of tears,

12:09.438 --> 12:15.111
how in 1837, we arrived in new
lands called Indian Territory.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.404
It was hard times.

12:16.612 --> 12:17.905
But like my daddy says,

12:18.114 --> 12:21.867
the Chickasaws will
never be conquered.

12:22.076 --> 12:24.328
But to live is to change,

12:24.537 --> 12:27.206
and that is what
happened in 1906.

12:27.415 --> 12:30.167
We now faced maybe our
biggest challenge.

12:30.376 --> 12:31.836
They were breaking
up our government

12:32.044 --> 12:33.838
for one of their own,

12:34.046 --> 12:37.591
a state called Oklahoma.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.725
When the world was still young,

12:45.933 --> 12:48.310
there was but one man upon it.

12:48.519 --> 12:53.524
Seeing that he was lonesome,
the Great Spirit sent a son.

12:53.733 --> 12:57.570
They walked upon the
Earth and found it good,

12:57.778 --> 12:59.572
but it was too cold.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.907
There were no trees
and no flowers

13:02.116 --> 13:05.077
to make the world beautiful.

13:05.911 --> 13:09.498
One night the young
brave had a dream,

13:09.707 --> 13:13.210
and he told his father it
would be through sacrifice

13:13.419 --> 13:16.756
that beauty will
walk upon the Earth.

13:17.715 --> 13:21.844
"I'll give myself to the
Great Spirit," said the son,

13:22.052 --> 13:25.765
and from his grave sprung
the first pine tree,

13:25.973 --> 13:29.727
and from that came all the
other beautiful trees.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.283
Mary!

13:44.992 --> 13:46.035
Mary!

13:47.411 --> 13:48.871
Mary, where are you?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.545
There she is!

13:56.754 --> 13:58.672
Mary Frances, where were you?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.424
Mama's looking for you!

14:00.633 --> 14:01.300
Readin'.

14:01.509 --> 14:02.510
Better hurry.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.398
Mama says cook's going
to throw it all away

14:04.422 --> 14:05.923
if it gets cold.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.671
They're really trying
to crack down now

14:20.695 --> 14:23.113
with Senator Judd as the
committee chairman.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.949
Indian offenses.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.243
People are afraid of
what they don't know.

14:28.304 --> 14:29.304
Go on.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.329
Wash up, you three!

14:30.538 --> 14:31.831
Yes, Daddy!

14:39.338 --> 14:40.338
Wash up, now.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.465
Yes, yes, Mama!

14:41.674 --> 14:42.901
Gladys, go to the kitchen
and get the rolls.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.509
Yes, Mama.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.717
Come sit down.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.154
Cook said if you don't
come in here...

14:46.178 --> 14:47.978
Yes, cook said he's going
to throw it all away

14:48.002 --> 14:48.502
if it gets cold.

14:48.711 --> 14:49.711
Yes, we know.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.688
And Lord, we ask for protection

14:55.896 --> 14:59.650
and provision over this
family and over our people.

14:59.859 --> 15:00.401
Amen.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.236
Amen.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.866
So, Mary, when do you
leave for college?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.576
Well, um...

15:08.784 --> 15:11.036
Still going to Oklahoma
College for Women

15:11.245 --> 15:13.247
over in Chickasha?

15:13.455 --> 15:15.291
Well, we was concerned
about tuition,

15:15.499 --> 15:17.251
but, uh, she's going
on a grant now,

15:17.459 --> 15:18.252
arts grant.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.337
I'd prefer she
stick around here,

15:20.546 --> 15:23.674
like her older
brothers and sister,

15:23.883 --> 15:26.176
nice and normal.

15:27.177 --> 15:30.222
You hear that there was, uh,
more bodies found in Lusitania?

15:30.431 --> 15:32.933
Unfortunately, there are
still over 1,200 passengers

15:33.142 --> 15:34.142
unaccounted for.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.936
Including Charles Frohman.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.900
And for those who hear my soul
sobbing in its darkest hour,

15:41.108 --> 15:45.446
I leave you the legacy
of my uncharted future,

15:45.654 --> 15:50.117
flung far among a
field of stars.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.067
Mary, where did you learn that?

15:53.245 --> 15:54.845
She learned it from
when the Frohman play

15:54.869 --> 15:55.869
came through town.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.833
She can say the whole
thing, can't you, Mary?

15:58.042 --> 15:59.418
Yep.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.962
Is this what we have in store
for after meal entertainment?

16:03.005 --> 16:06.675
Unthrifty loveliness,
why dost thou spend?

16:06.884 --> 16:08.761
Upon thyselves...

16:08.969 --> 16:10.262
She'll get over it.

16:10.471 --> 16:14.975
She lends to those who are free.

16:28.674 --> 16:29.674
Mary?

16:29.698 --> 16:30.866
Yeah.

16:31.075 --> 16:33.115
Take this here basket on up
to the Brewsters' place.

16:33.139 --> 16:34.453
How come I have to go?

16:34.662 --> 16:35.722
Because they got
eight mouths to feed

16:35.746 --> 16:37.026
and they as poor as church mice.

16:37.122 --> 16:37.831
That's why.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.250
Well, if they have eight mouths,

16:40.459 --> 16:43.128
then seems to me like
they have 16 feet.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.463
Mary.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.471
Get off this property.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.390
No, I'm tired of you
drinking my water

16:54.598 --> 16:55.724
and eating my grass.

16:55.933 --> 16:56.600
Look at me.

16:56.809 --> 16:57.309
Akakostini'cho.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.018
This is the last time

16:58.227 --> 16:59.353
I'm going to tell you.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.145
Speak English!

17:00.354 --> 17:00.938
You know what I'm saying.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.315
Oka', Oka', Oka'

17:03.524 --> 17:05.275
I want you to stay
off this property.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.644
All you Indians are the same.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.569
You think this is your land.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.698
You look at me when
I'm talking to you!

17:10.906 --> 17:13.200
Akakostini'cho

17:13.409 --> 17:15.202
I want you to stay
off this property!

17:19.123 --> 17:20.165
Mom, somebody's coming!

17:27.964 --> 17:29.008
Hey.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.885
Your mother home?

17:32.636 --> 17:34.596
You speak English?

17:36.158 --> 17:37.158
Ah!

17:37.182 --> 17:37.683
What wilt thou do?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.309
Thou wilt not murder me!

17:40.060 --> 17:42.021
Ah!

17:49.069 --> 17:50.362
Here.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.364
Tell Bertie we appreciate it.

17:52.573 --> 17:53.282
Mm-hmm.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.783
Could I offer you some coffee?

17:54.992 --> 17:58.495
Uh, thank you, ma'am,
I best be on my way.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.665
It weren't always like this.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.667
Just hard times is all.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.836
It'll get better.

18:06.045 --> 18:07.671
Come on, boys.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.922
Let's go eat.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.131
Come on.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.892
Daddy!

19:03.289 --> 19:04.449
What in the world's going on?

19:04.473 --> 19:05.390
What's going on?

19:05.479 --> 19:06.855
Thomas!

19:07.064 --> 19:08.524
What happened?

19:08.732 --> 19:09.900
They were just talking.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.109
Who?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.236
Who?

19:12.444 --> 19:13.070
Mary?

19:13.278 --> 19:14.655
The elder...

19:14.863 --> 19:15.948
The elder?

19:16.156 --> 19:19.535
The elder and the white man.

19:20.702 --> 19:21.745
Where?

19:21.954 --> 19:22.704
Mary?

19:22.913 --> 19:23.664
Where is he?

19:23.872 --> 19:25.499
At the...

19:25.707 --> 19:26.707
It's okay.

19:26.834 --> 19:31.088
The mule road, right
before the fort.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.296
No, TB, no!

19:32.422 --> 19:33.173
Not now, Bertie.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.342
TB, don't!

19:35.551 --> 19:37.136
You keep her inside!

19:37.344 --> 19:38.762
She needs to stay inside!

19:56.590 --> 19:57.590
Are you bleeding?

19:57.614 --> 19:58.824
Are you...?

20:02.494 --> 20:07.124
Sheriff says he was trespassing.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.458
So they shot him?

20:08.667 --> 20:11.545
Any time an Indian
tangos with a white man,

20:11.753 --> 20:13.589
white man always...

20:13.797 --> 20:18.343
he always wins, every time.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.596
She shouldn't have been
out there alone, Bertie.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.889
She shouldn't...

20:22.097 --> 20:23.932
she shouldn't be going
anywhere alone.

20:25.809 --> 20:32.608
She should stay right here,
where I can keep her safe.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.568
I can keep her safe.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.420
Now you'll see that
she gets a taxicab

20:53.629 --> 20:54.922
as soon as she
gets to Chickasha?

20:55.482 --> 20:56.482
She'll be fine.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.758
First train ride by herself.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.009
I understand, sir.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.584
Oklahoma College for Women?

21:41.927 --> 21:43.720
So you're going to
college, are you?

21:50.185 --> 21:51.665
Don't believe I've
ever seen an Indian

21:51.689 --> 21:53.689
up at the school before.

21:53.897 --> 21:57.901
You are Indian, aren't you?

21:58.944 --> 22:00.464
Didn't have those
kind of opportunities

22:00.488 --> 22:03.031
when I was your age.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.035
One quarter Choctaw, just
enough to make it tough

22:07.244 --> 22:09.162
in a white man's world.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.553
Young lady, you make
the most of this.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.013
You're doing it for all of us.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.082
Hello.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.793
Hi.

22:58.170 --> 23:02.924
Uh, well, welcome.

23:03.467 --> 23:07.512
I'm Carla Bennett,
your roommate.

23:07.721 --> 23:10.432
Mary Frances Thompson.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.060
Um, this...

23:13.268 --> 23:15.270
these are my friends.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.148
I'm Margaret.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.359
Hi, I'm Mary, Mary Thompson.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.487
This is my roommate.

23:24.446 --> 23:30.285
It's so nice to see OCW
accepting all types.

23:30.786 --> 23:34.623
Yes, we Indians are
very grateful.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.251
Well, I'm sure glad
that you're here.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.780
If... if you need
anything at all,

23:39.878 --> 23:42.339
our room's just down
the hall on the right.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.092
Why don't we go see
if Wendy came in yet?

24:10.700 --> 24:13.036
Thank you for all
your letters, Mama.

24:13.245 --> 24:15.747
With all the exciting things
college has to offer,

24:15.956 --> 24:19.376
I can barely find time to reply.

24:19.960 --> 24:25.715
Everybody here is so, uh,
accepting and welcoming.

24:26.341 --> 24:27.634
I've been learning so much.

24:30.512 --> 24:34.266
Between my studies,
all my new friends,

24:34.474 --> 24:36.852
and all the social events,

24:37.060 --> 24:42.858
I barely have any
time to myself.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.484
Give Daddy my love.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.199
I'm so glad things is
going good for you, Mary.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.453
Things are great at home too and
it's the good Lord's timing

24:54.661 --> 24:56.413
because another
baby's on its way.

24:56.621 --> 25:00.041
If it's a boy, we're naming
him after your father,

25:00.250 --> 25:04.087
Thomas Benjamin Jr.

25:04.296 --> 25:06.089
Don't wear yourself
out with parties.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.300
You're there for your education.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.553
Go ahead and have your fun
but keep them grades up too.

25:11.761 --> 25:12.761
Love, Mama.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.237
You speak sparrow.

25:29.446 --> 25:33.283
Um, my accent's a little rough.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.828
And what did our little
friend have to say?

25:37.037 --> 25:40.832
She was wondering why
she left the nest.

25:41.041 --> 25:45.504
Because it's the only
way to learn to soar.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.589
I'm Ms. Davis.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.132
Mary Frances.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.843
And I'm wondering, Mary, why you
didn't sign up for my class.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.972
What's your fifth period?

25:56.181 --> 25:57.307
My only free time.

25:57.516 --> 25:58.725
Was your only free time.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.310
Theatre room, tomorrow.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.645
The theatre room?

26:01.853 --> 26:03.104
It's in the basement.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.856
You'll find it.

26:05.065 --> 26:07.943
And what class is it?

26:08.151 --> 26:09.151
Expression.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.121
Good afternoon, girls.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.957
Good afternoon, Ms. Davis.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.205
So I take it everyone is
working on their monologues

26:24.251 --> 26:26.127
to razzle and dazzle us?

26:28.672 --> 26:31.216
So how many of you
are actually serious

26:31.424 --> 26:34.052
about a career on the
stage after graduation?

26:35.679 --> 26:37.347
Ah.

26:37.556 --> 26:41.434
Well, I feel it is my
duty to inform you

26:41.601 --> 26:44.062
that only a small
percentage of people

26:44.271 --> 26:46.565
actually make a
living performing.

26:46.773 --> 26:51.111
So today we are going to talk
about those who made it.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.029
Who's your favorite actress?

26:53.238 --> 26:54.238
Sarah Bernhardt.

26:54.281 --> 26:58.243
Yes, Sarah Bernhardt
has been called

26:58.451 --> 27:01.246
the most famous actress
that ever lived.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.998
And I think that's a...

27:03.206 --> 27:05.917
an accurate statement.

27:06.126 --> 27:12.966
But did you also know that
she lost a leg mid-career?

27:13.174 --> 27:15.844
And yet, she went on to
have a brilliant career

27:16.052 --> 27:20.223
without the aid of
an artificial limb.

27:20.432 --> 27:27.647
Fate took her leg, but it
didn't take what's inside,

27:27.856 --> 27:33.820
the passion and the
ability to say something.

27:34.738 --> 27:37.699
That's what will separate
you from the masses.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.869
Charm will deceive.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.080
Beauty will fade.

27:45.665 --> 27:50.420
But a woman with conviction
will last forever.

27:50.629 --> 27:53.048
So what do you have to say?

27:53.256 --> 27:59.179
What stories do
you have to tell?

27:59.387 --> 28:01.097
That's what I want to know.

28:01.306 --> 28:04.225
That's what this
class is all about.

28:04.434 --> 28:09.356
You can do it, all of you.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.443
Welcome.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.489
And now, um, we're
going to talk about

28:17.697 --> 28:20.867
Sarah Bernhardt's most
controversial role, Hamlet,

28:21.076 --> 28:23.370
where she played the lead.

28:23.578 --> 28:28.083
Yes, a woman can
play a man's role,

28:28.291 --> 28:29.751
a whole lot more
convincingly than

28:29.959 --> 28:32.337
a man can play a woman's
role, I assure you.

28:36.549 --> 28:40.970
Why would I dare to think
that you would understand?

28:41.179 --> 28:45.975
Yes, you, who hears my soul
weeping in its darkest hour,

28:46.184 --> 28:50.188
I offer you a legacy
of my uncharted future

28:50.397 --> 28:56.444
flung far among the
field of stars.

28:56.653 --> 28:59.030
That was terrific!

28:59.239 --> 29:00.490
Frohman, isn't it?

29:00.699 --> 29:03.284
Is that what you're doing
for the class monologue?

29:03.493 --> 29:05.453
Probably Shakespeare.

29:05.662 --> 29:07.080
You?

29:07.288 --> 29:08.288
Shakespeare.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.669
Does everyone need
to do a monologue?

29:12.877 --> 29:14.754
Oh, yeah, no escaping it.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.924
I could accompany
you if you want,

29:18.133 --> 29:21.219
some music, maybe piano?

29:21.428 --> 29:22.470
Really?

29:22.679 --> 29:26.683
Sure, it might boost the
dramatic impact of it.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.644
So where are you from?

29:29.853 --> 29:31.646
I was born in Emet.

29:31.855 --> 29:33.440
It's a little town.

29:33.648 --> 29:35.859
You probably never
even heard of it.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.861
My folks live in Tishomingo now.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.280
I know Tishomingo.

29:40.488 --> 29:43.241
Are you Chickasaw then?

29:43.450 --> 29:48.371
You got any Indian stories,
like the myths and the legends?

29:49.414 --> 29:50.415
I'm serious.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.501
I know nothing, nothing
about your people.

29:53.710 --> 29:58.923
I mean other than my dad
always saying stupid things.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.508
Oh, come on.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.844
You gotta give me something.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.138
Please?

30:07.265 --> 30:09.768
Pretty please?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.438
My father used to
tell me this one.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.024
The stage is yours.

30:17.066 --> 30:21.112
Old Earth maker made everything

30:21.321 --> 30:23.323
the way that he wanted.

30:23.490 --> 30:30.914
But one day, he looked
down and he saw Rabbit

30:31.122 --> 30:33.291
shivering in the cold.

30:33.500 --> 30:37.462
Rabbit did not want
to be this way so

30:37.670 --> 30:42.133
he began to make a little
song and a little dance

30:42.342 --> 30:45.053
so that he could try
to tell Earth maker

30:45.261 --> 30:47.430
how he wanted to be.

31:03.238 --> 31:06.449
Happy as Hermia,
wheresoe'er she lies,

31:06.658 --> 31:11.913
for she hath blessed
and attractive eyes.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.290
How came her eyes so bright?

31:14.499 --> 31:16.084
Not with salt tears.

31:16.292 --> 31:20.797
If so, my eyes are oftener
washed than hers.

31:21.005 --> 31:27.637
No, I am as ugly as a bear,

31:27.846 --> 31:32.684
for beasts, when they see
me, they run away in fear!

31:33.810 --> 31:36.312
Oh, pardon my interruption.

31:36.521 --> 31:38.314
Hi, Ms. Davis.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.149
Please, do continue.

31:40.358 --> 31:44.737
Uh, I was just going over
what to do for class,

31:44.946 --> 31:46.030
and I was looking at...

31:46.239 --> 31:47.657
Midsummer Night's Dream?

31:47.866 --> 31:48.866
You were very good.

31:48.992 --> 31:50.869
Thank you.

31:51.661 --> 31:54.247
You know, Mary, uh, I've
been giving these monologues

31:54.455 --> 31:57.709
for years and years, and
everyone does Shakespeare,

31:57.917 --> 31:59.252
everyone.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.155
Did you know you're
the first Indian

32:04.179 --> 32:06.467
that ever enrolled at OCW?

32:06.676 --> 32:08.386
And that's not a crutch.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.930
It's an advantage.

32:13.349 --> 32:17.687
What could you show me that
I haven't seen before?

32:17.896 --> 32:23.359
What can you offer
that all these

32:23.568 --> 32:26.154
little sugar cookies can't?

32:30.408 --> 32:31.576
That's what I want to see.

32:33.244 --> 32:34.579
See you in class.

32:34.787 --> 32:35.872
Thank you, Ms. Davis.

33:54.784 --> 34:02.166
Should you ask me when these
legends and traditions,

34:02.750 --> 34:08.672
I should answer, I
should tell you,

34:08.880 --> 34:13.011
in the bird's nest
of the forest,

34:13.719 --> 34:18.141
in the hoof print of the bison,

34:18.349 --> 34:22.478
in the airy of the eagle.

34:25.732 --> 34:31.029
Listen to these Indian legends.

34:33.364 --> 34:38.119
Like a death web spun
twixt the setting moon

34:38.327 --> 34:45.752
and the rising sun, our glory
sinks like the sinking moon.

34:48.170 --> 34:54.427
The red man's race
shall perish soon,

34:54.635 --> 35:00.349
for feet shall trip
where the web is spun,

35:00.558 --> 35:05.438
for no dawn shall be
ours, and no rising sun.

35:05.646 --> 35:11.611
No dawn is ours and
no rising sun!

35:24.207 --> 35:26.459
So tell me, what
will you do next?

35:26.667 --> 35:31.464
Um, continue my studies,
and then maybe New York?

35:31.672 --> 35:32.924
Broadway?

35:33.132 --> 35:34.342
Wow.

35:34.550 --> 35:38.971
I think I might have just
the launching pad for you.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.060
Carnegie?

35:44.268 --> 35:46.437
Carnegie Tech, my
old alma mater,

35:46.646 --> 35:48.314
the best theatre company
in the country.

35:48.523 --> 35:50.525
Yes, I know.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.277
But they would never
accept me in it.

35:53.486 --> 35:54.529
I couldn't afford it.

35:54.737 --> 35:56.280
Well, no, no, no, one
thing at a time.

35:56.489 --> 35:58.741
I just mailed my recommendation

35:58.950 --> 36:01.035
along with your application.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.747
Now, it includes a
few embellishments,

36:04.956 --> 36:09.669
ones that I hope that you will
fulfill for me this summer.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.170
When does your train leave?

36:11.379 --> 36:12.380
2:30.

36:12.588 --> 36:13.965
Perfect.

36:14.173 --> 36:18.261
Just enough time to meet a
very dear friend of mine.

36:21.472 --> 36:26.269
♪ This little light of mine,
I'm going to let it shine. ♪

36:26.477 --> 36:31.607
♪ This little light of mine,
I'm going to let it shine. ♪

36:31.816 --> 36:37.071
♪ This little light of mine,
I'm going to let it shine. ♪

36:37.280 --> 36:42.451
♪ This little light of mine,
I'm going to let it shine. ♪

36:42.660 --> 36:43.900
♪ This little light of mine... ♪

36:45.079 --> 36:46.581
Take a break.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.834
You must be Mary Frances.

36:50.042 --> 36:54.422
I'm Thurow Lieurance, and
this is the Chautauqua Tour.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.424
32 towns in 40 nights.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.676
It's education,
it's entertainment,

36:58.885 --> 37:00.386
it's fun to the entire family,

37:00.553 --> 37:03.973
and it is the most American
thing in all of America.

37:04.182 --> 37:09.353
But, as I told Ms. Davis, I
must have an Indian act.

37:09.562 --> 37:11.105
I must have you.

37:12.023 --> 37:14.442
Knock on wood?

37:14.650 --> 37:16.652
That would be wonderful.

37:16.861 --> 37:17.861
When is it?

37:18.029 --> 37:19.363
Now.

37:19.572 --> 37:20.615
This summer?

37:20.823 --> 37:25.244
Ah, my dear, there is no
time like the present,

37:25.453 --> 37:27.747
or the immediate future, right?

37:27.955 --> 37:30.583
Have a seat.

37:33.836 --> 37:37.757
My leg?

37:37.965 --> 37:41.219
Some years ago, I was
traveling by wagon out west,

37:41.427 --> 37:43.304
on a music-gathering expedition,

37:43.512 --> 37:45.973
when a blizzard sprung up
and turned the world white.

37:46.182 --> 37:48.302
You couldn't even see your
hand in front of your face.

37:48.476 --> 37:51.187
And before long, we had
plunged into a crevasse.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.813
My leg was smashed.

37:53.022 --> 37:54.941
I was trapped beneath the wagon.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.401
I couldn't move and I
had been left for dead.

37:57.610 --> 38:01.072
I lay there, drifting in
and out of consciousness.

38:01.280 --> 38:06.744
When suddenly, I
began to hear music.

38:06.953 --> 38:10.539
It was strange music, drums
and rattles and gongs,

38:10.748 --> 38:15.503
and these marvelous rhythms
that I had never heard before.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.172
The music seemed to grow
stronger and stronger

38:18.381 --> 38:23.135
and stronger, and then silence.

38:24.095 --> 38:27.265
I woke in a sea
of warm blankets.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.725
The room was lit by fire

38:29.934 --> 38:31.686
and an Indian doctor
was wiping my brow.

38:31.894 --> 38:34.897
He had done what he had to do.

38:35.106 --> 38:37.275
He amputated my leg.

38:37.483 --> 38:41.570
But in taking it,
he saved my life.

38:41.779 --> 38:45.324
The music, was it real?

38:45.533 --> 38:46.867
As real as life itself.

38:47.076 --> 38:50.329
To me, the music that I heard
was the music of the spirits

38:50.538 --> 38:52.748
come to save my life.

38:52.957 --> 38:56.544
And ever since that day, I
have made it my life's work

38:56.752 --> 39:00.673
to bring the music of the
Indians to people everywhere.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.174
So what do you say?

39:02.341 --> 39:05.928
Do I have my Indian act?

39:07.054 --> 39:09.515
May I bring my piano
player with me?

39:09.724 --> 39:10.308
Deal.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.600
Welcome aboard.

39:16.272 --> 39:17.857
There she is.

39:18.065 --> 39:18.524
Mama!

39:18.733 --> 39:19.733
Daddy!

39:22.903 --> 39:24.697
Look at you, all educated.

39:24.905 --> 39:28.242
Hi, Mama.

39:28.451 --> 39:30.786
So I know you're
just back and all,

39:30.995 --> 39:33.331
but I have spoken to
the local school,

39:33.539 --> 39:35.624
and they're looking
for a teacher there.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.126
That's great, Daddy.

39:37.335 --> 39:39.795
Uh, let's talk about it at home.

39:40.004 --> 39:41.004
Okay.

39:43.132 --> 39:44.133
Say what?

39:44.342 --> 39:46.594
The Carnegie's across
the whole country.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.929
I mean aren't you
educated enough?

39:49.138 --> 39:52.350
Let's discuss this
once she's accepted.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.518
I'm going to get accepted.

39:54.727 --> 39:57.313
I just don't want you
getting your hopes up.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.857
Things are more challenging
for people in our situation.

40:00.066 --> 40:02.693
You mean being Indian?

40:02.902 --> 40:05.029
That's not a crutch, Mama.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.697
It's an advantage.

40:06.906 --> 40:08.783
Well, I can't afford it.

40:08.991 --> 40:13.412
Well, maybe I can.

40:19.794 --> 40:22.380
Touring with some freak show.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.968
Mama, talk to him.

40:28.177 --> 40:29.762
He hasn't been
just right lately.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.015
And the idea of you out there
in the big wide world...

40:33.224 --> 40:35.726
He wants me to stay here
and become a teacher

40:35.935 --> 40:38.270
and behave like a
nice, normal person.

40:38.479 --> 40:41.357
There's nothing wrong
with nice or normal.

40:42.733 --> 40:45.694
But we brung you up
to know your own mind

40:45.903 --> 40:48.114
and to follow where
God leads you,

40:48.322 --> 40:49.865
and if that means
going cross-country

40:50.074 --> 40:51.409
and getting up on a stage,

40:51.617 --> 40:55.579
well, then you
best get up on it.

40:55.788 --> 40:58.165
Okay?

40:58.374 --> 41:00.000
Okay?

41:23.899 --> 41:28.737
Centuries ago, before
the white man,

41:28.946 --> 41:32.575
our people, restless and tired,

41:32.783 --> 41:36.912
searched desperately for
a place to call home.

41:37.121 --> 41:40.749
And every night, at the
end of the long journey,

41:40.958 --> 41:44.712
they stuck a sacred
pole on the ground

41:44.920 --> 41:48.549
so that it pointed straight
toward the heavens.

41:48.757 --> 41:54.513
And every morning, whichever
way it leaned, they traveled,

41:54.722 --> 41:58.559
until finally, it
leaned no more.

42:05.232 --> 42:08.152
The pole did not bring us here.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.989
The white man forced us here.

42:12.198 --> 42:17.828
But now, this is our home,

42:18.037 --> 42:24.418
and we don't have to wander
anymore, and neither do you.

42:24.627 --> 42:27.254
I love that story, Daddy.

42:27.463 --> 42:33.594
And that's why I have to go, so
that I can tell our stories.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.478
What's your stage name?

42:45.231 --> 42:48.734
Mary Frances Thompson is for
the name of my daughter,

42:48.943 --> 42:50.236
not a performer.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.821
What about what Uncle
Doug used to call her,

42:53.030 --> 42:54.823
Aiukla Ohoyo?

42:55.032 --> 42:57.993
Oh, no, Mama.

42:58.202 --> 43:01.664
People have to be
able to pronounce it.

43:03.123 --> 43:06.168
What was it Aunt Mary called
her when she was a baby?

43:06.377 --> 43:08.420
Te Ata.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.839
Te Ata?

43:11.048 --> 43:12.091
I love it.

43:12.299 --> 43:12.716
What...

43:12.925 --> 43:13.717
what does it mean?

43:13.926 --> 43:16.053
Bearer of the morning.

43:16.262 --> 43:18.430
That's perfect.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.319
That's because you
started crying every day

43:20.528 --> 43:21.779
at the crack of dawn for hours,

43:21.987 --> 43:23.644
and nobody could shut you up.

43:24.061 --> 43:25.421
I mean she was like
a dang rooster,

43:25.445 --> 43:27.572
wasn't she, Bertie?

43:55.217 --> 44:01.724
The moon, the sun, the
wind, the rainbow,

44:01.932 --> 44:08.022
the thunder, all came
to visit Ababinili

44:14.153 --> 44:18.907
Listen to my story that
came from my father

44:19.116 --> 44:22.077
and from his father before him.

45:14.546 --> 45:18.801
The next story I am
going to tell you

45:19.009 --> 45:21.470
is a very ancient story.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.390
The summer's been exhausting,

45:24.598 --> 45:26.850
but I never felt more alive.

45:27.059 --> 45:29.687
I met with this Seminole woman
after my last performance,

45:29.895 --> 45:31.397
and she asked me if I could tell

45:31.605 --> 45:33.941
the stories of her people.

45:38.612 --> 45:40.322
Now word is spreading

45:40.531 --> 45:44.451
and I'm meeting with various
tribes wherever I go.

45:49.248 --> 45:53.794
They share their stories with me

45:54.002 --> 45:58.716
so that I may share them
with the whole world.

46:32.541 --> 46:34.877
How big was Kansas City?

46:35.085 --> 46:36.128
Massive.

46:36.336 --> 46:38.505
Crowds everywhere.

46:38.714 --> 46:41.341
I'm definitely going
to travel too.

46:44.803 --> 46:49.266
Um, that man, when
is he going to stop?

46:49.475 --> 46:50.476
Wait.

46:50.684 --> 46:53.854
All forms of Indian
rituals are prohibited?

46:54.062 --> 46:56.398
Can't sell traditional items?

46:56.607 --> 46:57.607
Is...

46:57.691 --> 46:58.691
is this true?

46:58.859 --> 47:00.194
In theory, not in practice.

47:00.402 --> 47:02.780
That's what they say.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.869
Carnegie.

47:13.832 --> 47:15.876
Did you get in, Mary?

47:31.600 --> 47:32.893
Rejected.

47:33.101 --> 47:34.101
Hmm.

47:34.144 --> 47:35.729
Hmm.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.273
Don't you dare take joy in this.

47:38.482 --> 47:40.025
I wouldn't even dream of it.

47:40.234 --> 47:42.194
But I think it's a sign.

47:42.402 --> 47:45.447
Fate has spoken.

47:45.989 --> 47:46.990
Mama?

47:47.199 --> 47:48.199
Yeah, honey.

47:48.242 --> 47:50.577
Can you take me to
the train station?

47:52.120 --> 47:53.121
Wait, no, Mary!

47:53.330 --> 47:54.790
Mary Frances, where
you going now?

47:54.998 --> 47:56.166
Can I go too, Daddy?

47:56.375 --> 47:57.375
No!

47:57.501 --> 47:58.210
You ain't going
anywhere, young lady.

47:58.418 --> 47:59.418
Fine!

47:59.503 --> 48:00.563
Oh, Thomas, when are
you going to learn?

48:00.587 --> 48:01.987
You can't keep a
Thompson girl down.

48:02.011 --> 48:02.464
Bertie!

48:02.673 --> 48:03.257
Come on, honey.

48:03.465 --> 48:04.842
Come on.

48:05.050 --> 48:06.050
See you later, Daddy!

48:06.570 --> 48:07.570
You hold on!

48:07.594 --> 48:09.137
I'm the man of the house here!

48:24.278 --> 48:25.779
Mr. Stevens, please.

48:25.988 --> 48:27.068
Do you have an appointment?

48:27.092 --> 48:27.739
I'm sure I do.

48:27.906 --> 48:28.407
I...

48:28.615 --> 48:28.991
I sent a telegram...

48:29.199 --> 48:29.741
Your name?

48:29.950 --> 48:31.577
Te Ata Thompson.

48:31.785 --> 48:33.412
Please have a seat.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.289
Thank you.

48:42.504 --> 48:43.504
Miss Thompson?

48:43.630 --> 48:45.215
Yes, Te Ata Thompson.

48:45.424 --> 48:47.467
Yes, well, I believe
you've gotten our letter.

48:47.676 --> 48:50.679
Yes, and I thought I'd get
a chance to audition.

48:50.888 --> 48:51.888
Audition.

48:51.972 --> 48:53.891
Yes, well, enrollment
is closed, dear.

48:54.099 --> 48:57.644
You try again in the
spring, all right?

48:58.645 --> 49:00.439
Which way is the theatre?

49:00.647 --> 49:03.775
That a way.

49:04.234 --> 49:05.819
Now, now hold on a second.

49:06.028 --> 49:10.157
Just what do you
think you're doing?

49:13.035 --> 49:15.370
Miss, stop!

49:15.579 --> 49:18.999
Stop!

49:21.710 --> 49:23.462
Miss, stop.

49:23.670 --> 49:24.670
Stop!

49:25.714 --> 49:29.134
We are getting ready
for a production here!

49:29.343 --> 49:34.306
Mr. Stevens, I just traveled
1,117 miles to get here.

49:34.514 --> 49:38.852
I would really love a
chance to audition for you.

49:40.187 --> 49:41.605
I can't accept you alone.

49:41.813 --> 49:43.023
There is a committee.

49:43.231 --> 49:46.068
Well, how long would it
take to get them all here?

49:49.571 --> 49:52.908
Give me ten minutes.

49:53.116 --> 49:54.242
Thank you, sir!

50:03.794 --> 50:11.051
The circle of the Earth is
the head of a great drum.

50:11.259 --> 50:16.515
With the day, it grows
upward, booming.

50:16.723 --> 50:17.963
I think they're in the theatre.

50:18.100 --> 50:23.313
Who is the drummer who beats
upon the Earth's drum?

50:23.522 --> 50:30.529
Who is the drummer who makes
me dance to this song?

50:42.040 --> 50:44.292
I think we can find
a place for you.

50:53.927 --> 50:55.679
Another postcard from Mary.

50:55.887 --> 50:58.015
Oh, it's been a year?

50:58.223 --> 51:00.058
Tell me she's coming home.

51:00.267 --> 51:02.185
New York City.

51:04.146 --> 51:05.814
Tell Daddy not to worry.

51:06.023 --> 51:09.151
Ms. Davis has me staying
at the Three Arts Club.

51:09.359 --> 51:12.571
It's for actresses starting out.

51:12.779 --> 51:15.365
And she's going to set up
some private performances

51:15.574 --> 51:18.368
so I can earn my keep.

51:43.078 --> 51:44.078
Take this, pretty lady?

51:44.102 --> 51:45.520
Oh, no, no thank you.

51:45.729 --> 51:46.729
Papers!

51:46.813 --> 51:48.482
Papers!

51:53.070 --> 51:54.070
Um, sorry.

51:54.237 --> 51:56.031
Do you know where
West End Avenue is?

51:56.239 --> 51:58.116
It's, uh, ten blocks this way.

51:58.325 --> 51:59.409
Thank you.

52:12.047 --> 52:13.381
Thank you.

52:14.943 --> 52:15.943
Hi.

52:15.967 --> 52:16.967
Hi.

52:17.094 --> 52:18.678
Um, I'm here to check in, uh...

52:18.887 --> 52:20.889
It's about time you got here.

52:21.098 --> 52:23.433
Margaret?

52:23.642 --> 52:24.684
What are you doing here?

52:27.187 --> 52:28.271
I live here.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.160
And when Ms. Davis told
me you were coming,

52:30.184 --> 52:32.436
I traded out my
roommate for you.

52:33.610 --> 52:34.610
I'll show her up.

52:35.112 --> 52:36.238
Thank you!

52:38.740 --> 52:40.325
Ta-da!

52:40.534 --> 52:41.701
Oh, my!

52:41.910 --> 52:45.330
This is so perfect.

52:47.916 --> 52:49.376
Oh.

52:49.584 --> 52:52.045
Oh, wow.

52:52.254 --> 52:55.132
So, uh, so what are
we going to do now?

52:55.340 --> 52:57.050
Rest.

52:57.259 --> 53:00.804
Tomorrow you hit the
ground running.

53:39.676 --> 53:41.386
Ta Atay?

53:41.553 --> 53:42.762
Te Ata.

53:42.971 --> 53:44.055
Whatever.

53:45.807 --> 53:48.059
My heart can't take
it any longer.

53:48.226 --> 53:48.977
You were like the...

53:49.186 --> 53:50.186
Next.

53:55.233 --> 53:56.276
Next.

53:58.987 --> 54:02.657
Slave, soulless villain, dog!

54:02.866 --> 54:05.076
Oh, rarely base!

54:05.285 --> 54:05.952
Good.

54:06.161 --> 54:06.578
Thanks.

54:06.786 --> 54:07.579
We'll contact you.

54:07.787 --> 54:09.497
Do you have my address and...?

54:09.706 --> 54:10.790
Next.

54:12.792 --> 54:15.837
When sorrows come, they
come not single...

54:16.046 --> 54:17.422
Next.

54:25.847 --> 54:27.515
Oh, hi.

54:27.724 --> 54:28.804
Hi, yeah, yeah, come on in.

54:28.934 --> 54:29.934
Come on in.

54:30.018 --> 54:32.896
Take your mark.

54:33.104 --> 54:34.231
Pocahontas.

54:34.439 --> 54:36.858
Before we get started, are
you okay wearing that?

54:44.115 --> 54:46.701
You first.

55:00.632 --> 55:02.801
Hey, how'd it go?

55:03.009 --> 55:04.678
Uh, wardrobe didn't fit.

55:04.886 --> 55:05.595
Uh, how was your play?

55:05.804 --> 55:07.931
Oh, best non-paying gig even

55:08.139 --> 55:09.379
Gotta get to my paying gig now,

55:09.557 --> 55:10.809
at the theatre.

55:12.519 --> 55:15.522
I've been here for almost
a year and nothing.

55:15.730 --> 55:17.399
I'm running out of money.

55:17.607 --> 55:19.901
I can see if they have an
opening at the theatre.

55:20.110 --> 55:22.362
Thanks anyways.

55:22.570 --> 55:24.948
Ms. Davis has scheduled
four private performances

55:25.156 --> 55:26.533
next week.

55:26.741 --> 55:28.501
Well, you're going to
make some good scratch.

55:28.525 --> 55:30.819
But I'm in New
York for Broadway.

55:32.289 --> 55:34.499
Hey.

55:34.708 --> 55:35.875
Keep pounding.

55:36.084 --> 55:38.378
Something eventually
is going to break.

55:38.586 --> 55:40.338
What if it's me?

55:40.547 --> 55:43.258
Unbreakable.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.302
Bye.

55:45.510 --> 55:46.510
Bye.

55:48.972 --> 55:51.266
Once there was a young maiden,

55:51.474 --> 55:55.979
and she lived by a
beautiful stream.

55:56.187 --> 56:01.693
One day, she looked into the
stream at her reflection.

56:01.901 --> 56:04.821
"Oh, my," she said.

56:05.030 --> 56:07.949
"I'm beautiful
enough for any man."

56:08.158 --> 56:12.871
So she walked down
to the riverbank.

56:13.079 --> 56:16.374
"Anybody 'round
here want a wife?"

56:16.583 --> 56:20.462
And somebody answered,
"I want a wife.

56:20.670 --> 56:22.964
I want a wife."

56:23.173 --> 56:27.719
"Well, what shall we live
on if we live together?"

56:27.927 --> 56:30.472
"We will live on grass."

56:30.680 --> 56:34.059
"Oh, I couldn't live on grass.

56:34.267 --> 56:38.688
"Grass is much too coarse for
a good looking girl like me."

56:38.897 --> 56:45.695
So she walked on down the banks
of the river and sang again.

56:45.904 --> 56:48.114
"Anybody 'round
here want a wife?"

56:48.323 --> 56:51.659
Someone answered,
"I want a wife."

56:51.868 --> 56:55.288
"What shall we live on
if we live together?"

56:55.497 --> 56:57.499
"We will live on seeds."

56:57.707 --> 57:03.588
"Oh, I love seeds."

57:03.797 --> 57:09.386
She was so pleased with him and
he was so pleased with her,

57:09.594 --> 57:14.307
and together they flew down
the banks of the river,

57:14.516 --> 57:20.647
because they were the
first birds of spring.

57:25.777 --> 57:29.197
Te Ata, would you
take questions?

57:29.406 --> 57:30.406
Of course.

57:30.532 --> 57:32.200
What tribe are you from, dear?

57:32.409 --> 57:33.618
I am Chickasaw.

57:33.827 --> 57:35.161
My father is Chickasaw.

57:35.370 --> 57:38.081
My mother is of German descent

57:38.289 --> 57:40.542
Then you are half Chickasaw.

57:40.750 --> 57:41.960
No, ma'am.

57:42.168 --> 57:46.589
My heart and soul
are 100% Chickasaw.

57:46.798 --> 57:47.798
Hmm.

57:47.882 --> 57:50.009
With the Indian Offenses Act,

57:50.218 --> 57:54.472
are songs and dances
like this illegal?

57:54.681 --> 57:59.144
The Bible says God's words
brought the world to being.

57:59.352 --> 58:03.731
We Chickasaw believe his
words came as a song,

58:03.940 --> 58:06.401
and if sharing this
song is illegal,

58:06.609 --> 58:11.197
well, there's not much
else to sing about then.

58:12.198 --> 58:14.617
As this is a private
event, I assure you it is

58:14.826 --> 58:15.952
well within the law.

58:16.161 --> 58:18.663
But I remind each
of you to support

58:18.872 --> 58:21.541
Governor Roosevelt in
his upcoming election.

58:21.749 --> 58:25.462
Mrs. Roosevelt and he are
big supporter of the arts

58:25.670 --> 58:28.423
and will make events
like this legal for all.

58:28.631 --> 58:31.259
Is there anything that
the white man does

58:31.468 --> 58:33.303
that you would deem offensive?

58:33.511 --> 58:36.431
I think the only thing that
upsets Indians the most

58:36.639 --> 58:40.018
is to find that the white man
grows perfectly good corn

58:40.185 --> 58:43.104
and never sings over it.

58:54.657 --> 58:58.786
If you'll excuse me,
uh, remarkable.

58:58.995 --> 58:59.579
Why, thank you.

58:59.787 --> 59:01.122
Uh, Clyde Fisher.

59:01.331 --> 59:02.331
Te Ata.

59:02.415 --> 59:03.124
Yes, of course.

59:03.333 --> 59:04.751
Uh, uh, something to do with,

59:04.959 --> 59:07.253
uh, the day break, yes?

59:07.462 --> 59:08.505
Bearer of the morning.

59:08.713 --> 59:12.175
Oh, yes, beautiful, beautiful.

59:12.383 --> 59:13.383
How did you know?

59:13.468 --> 59:15.303
Oh, uh, well, though
I'm a professor,

59:15.512 --> 59:18.598
I am always a student
of Indian culture.

59:18.806 --> 59:19.891
And what do you teach?

59:20.099 --> 59:20.892
Well, my...

59:21.060 --> 59:22.300
my first love is astronomy, uh,

59:22.324 --> 59:23.561
but I also teach, uh, zoology,

59:23.770 --> 59:25.188
uh, paleontology, anthropology,

59:25.396 --> 59:26.523
uh, geolo...

59:26.731 --> 59:27.815
Gee, am I boring you?

59:28.024 --> 59:29.025
No.

59:29.234 --> 59:32.779
No, it's, uh, it's
quite remarkable.

59:32.987 --> 59:35.281
What got you interested
in Indian culture?

59:35.490 --> 59:36.490
Well, I...

59:36.533 --> 59:38.243
I was on an expedition out west,

59:38.451 --> 59:41.079
and I was adopted
by the Sioux tribe.

59:41.287 --> 59:44.958
My Indian name, though lacking
in the imagery of Te Ata,

59:45.166 --> 59:46.668
certainly was fitting.

59:46.876 --> 59:50.046
They called me Afraid of Bear.

59:51.589 --> 59:53.633
You were tremendous.

59:53.841 --> 59:54.509
Here, here.

59:54.717 --> 59:55.717
Thank you.

59:55.760 --> 59:56.928
Dr. Fisher.

59:57.136 --> 59:58.137
Ma'am.

59:58.346 --> 59:59.490
I certainly hope to see
you and your husband

59:59.514 --> 01:00:01.154
out at the Natural
History Museum tomorrow

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:03.059
for the planetarium's unveiling.

01:00:03.268 --> 01:00:04.561
It's a small gathering.

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:07.355
It's open to the public as well.

01:00:07.564 --> 01:00:09.107
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:00:09.315 --> 01:00:09.941
Wonderful.

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.149
Wonderful.

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.945
Well, I'll leave
you ladies to it.

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:19.367
Your performance, my dear,
was absolutely breathtaking.

01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:24.664
I have never experienced
that sense of spirit.

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:27.584
You absolutely glow, my dean

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:37.635
A messenger dropped this off.

01:00:37.844 --> 01:00:39.679
It's casting services.

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:42.557
Thank you.

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:46.060
Ah!

01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:46.853
I got it!

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:48.061
I got it!

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:48.646
Got what?

01:00:48.855 --> 01:00:49.397
A role!

01:00:49.606 --> 01:00:51.357
A real role on Broadway!

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:52.984
What?

01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.652
It says The Red Poppy.

01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:56.696
It says right here,
it opens December 19.

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.573
It's not the lead, but it...

01:00:58.781 --> 01:00:59.861
it's fourth on the billing!

01:00:59.885 --> 01:01:00.886
Who cares?

01:01:02.762 --> 01:01:03.762
That's wonderful!

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:04.537
We have to celebrate!

01:01:04.746 --> 01:01:06.205
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:01:06.414 --> 01:01:08.207
Yeah, uh, uh, the...

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:09.616
the Museum of Natural History.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:10.376
Do you want to come?

01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:11.294
I'll pass.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:12.920
But when I get off work tonight,

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:15.673
we are celebrating!

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:25.224
In creating the planetarium,
I had one simple task,

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:28.102
to take one of the most
difficult subjects,

01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:30.813
one that we cannot
reach out and touch,

01:01:31.022 --> 01:01:35.318
and make it understandable,
not only to a man or a woman,

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:36.819
but to a child.

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:40.615
And tonight I will explain our
approach to that conun...

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:42.075
drum.

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:43.409
Hmm.

01:01:43.618 --> 01:01:46.579
But first I would like
to say how much it means

01:01:46.788 --> 01:01:48.915
to see you here this evening.

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:50.333
Huh.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.044
I was traveling in Germany
about two years ago,

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:55.012
and I had the good fortune
to meet with a man

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.214
named Carl Zeiss.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:57.840
How do you know so much?

01:01:58.049 --> 01:02:01.636
Huh, I have a love of learning.

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:07.016
Right now, we're walking between
600 and 700 miles per hour,

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:09.894
based on the constant
rotation of the Earth.

01:02:12.105 --> 01:02:14.357
Why waste the momentum?

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.943
Dare I say?

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.947
I never thought of
it that way before.

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:25.368
It is imperative to open
people's minds to new things.

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:29.997
Ignorance breeds fear, and
the only way to conquer that

01:02:30.206 --> 01:02:32.208
is to make the unknown known.

01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:33.209
Hmm.

01:02:33.418 --> 01:02:35.420
I think I would agree with that.

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:39.173
I would say more than agree.

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:40.591
Each time you take the stage,

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.761
you bring light to a dark world.

01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:48.641
I give these, uh, small
outdoor talks to a...

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:53.062
a camp of young little
rascals at Bear Mountain,

01:02:53.271 --> 01:02:55.148
up north.

01:02:55.356 --> 01:02:56.899
They come from poor homes.

01:02:57.108 --> 01:02:57.734
But...

01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:00.278
but their minds are sponges.

01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:04.157
This may be the only bit of
nature they ever get to see.

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:06.075
Would you...

01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:09.454
would you consider
performing for them?

01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:10.705
Well, it sounds lovely,

01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:14.876
but I just landed
a Broadway role.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:17.336
Congratulations!

01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:18.296
Huh!

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:19.589
Wonderful!

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:20.797
Wonderful.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.425
Well, it's my first
role, so I...

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:23.633
I need to stay focused.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:24.343
No, of course.

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:25.261
Of course, of course.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.054
Hey, uh, perhaps another time.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:27.805
That's...

01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.807
that's wonderful.

01:03:30.016 --> 01:03:33.519
Could I offer you a
celebratory meal?

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:34.728
I'd love that.

01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:35.772

Yes.

01:05:31.888 --> 01:05:34.891
It is still abuzz out there.

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:35.474
It's electric.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.434
What a run!

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:38.144
You were wonderful.

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:40.104
How does it feel?

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:44.025
Um, I thought I'd
be more excited.

01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:48.738
Hmm.

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.323
What do you mean?

01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.198
I'm not sure.

01:05:51.407 --> 01:05:54.118
I feel off is all, like...

01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:56.746
like something's missing.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.749
Must be the empty stomach.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.751
Hmm, must be.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.170
I have made us
dinner reservations.

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:05.588
That should help.

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.116
You think that we
can go somewhere

01:06:07.173 --> 01:06:10.927
where I don't have to think
or talk or be somebody?

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:13.846
Yes, of course, love.

01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:14.847
There's a...

01:06:15.056 --> 01:06:16.390
a film playing
across the street,

01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:20.019
a new film, darkened
room, moving pictures,

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:23.314
music, popcorn, I guess.

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:26.609
It's perfect.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.070
I can't sufficiently
describe the feeling.

01:06:29.278 --> 01:06:30.821
Those last few notes, like...

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:35.242
like a wave coming
over the audience,

01:06:35.451 --> 01:06:36.491
and they are completely...

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:37.787
Whoa, watch your step.

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:39.205
Are you okay?

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:42.458
Yeah, I thought I saw something.

01:06:58.391 --> 01:06:59.642
Oh, beat it.

01:07:03.873 --> 01:07:04.873
There's a tree!

01:07:04.897 --> 01:07:06.607
Hurry!

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:36.762
Hellum chief say,

01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:38.556
woo, woo!

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:53.738
Me want 'em chug chug with me.

01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:57.825
Let's get out of here.

01:08:12.173 --> 01:08:13.173
Um, I'm sorry.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:16.426
No, no, no, no,
no, it's not you.

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:19.095
That's...

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:20.930
how they see me.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:22.892
It was a cartoon.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.227
It was a stupid cartoon.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.938
About a stupid Indian.

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:30.858
Not about you.

01:08:31.067 --> 01:08:34.944
I was so stupid
thinking that I could

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:36.822
come to Broadway and...

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:38.948
and make a difference.

01:08:51.295 --> 01:08:55.216
Why did you pursue
the performing arts?

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.176
To pretend to be other people?

01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:01.596
No.

01:09:02.223 --> 01:09:03.557
Then why?

01:09:10.523 --> 01:09:16.444
Do you know how I made astronomy
interesting to adults?

01:09:16.654 --> 01:09:19.323
By making it interesting
to a child.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:22.618
If a child could understand
it and enjoy it,

01:09:22.827 --> 01:09:24.578
an adult could too.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.542
And what are you getting at?

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.292
You need to get away.

01:09:31.502 --> 01:09:33.546
You need to get away.

01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:35.756
You remember the camp
that I told you about?

01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:37.049
Let's do that.

01:09:37.258 --> 01:09:40.594
Let's do that this weekend.

01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:41.886
I don't know.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.776
I will cancel my meeting
on Friday morning,

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.558
and I will drive you
up there myself.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.086
If I can make time in my busy
schedule for a mountain trip,

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:50.270
then certainly, you can too.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.648
It would be a
wonderful adventure.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.404
I want to focus on Broadway.

01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:04.034
Maybe it's not about
what you want to do.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:06.829
Maybe it's about what
you were meant to do.

01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:15.963
I'd need a canoe.

01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:25.639
All set.

01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:28.184
Oh, bon voyage!

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:29.101
Woo!

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:30.019
Woo!

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.771
Don't drown, oh, great explorer!

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.107
I'll see you on the
other side of the lake!

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.543
Oh wait, you all see that?

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:55.752
What is that?

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:09.475
Chokma.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:31.622
My name is Te Ata,
bearer of the morning.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:37.044
I am a Chickasaw Indian
from the state of Oklahoma

01:11:37.253 --> 01:11:40.673
and also a storyteller.

01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:46.387
Indians are the
Natives of this land.

01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:48.931
They belong here.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:55.938
Everything that they learn,
they learn from nature.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.407
Hmm.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:51.827
Thank you for today.

01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:54.455
My soul really needed this.

01:12:54.663 --> 01:12:56.915
So did mine.

01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:00.669
Come look.

01:13:00.878 --> 01:13:01.920
What are we looking at?

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:05.591
Oh, it is a heavenly sight.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:07.134
Oh, really?

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:18.830
How did...

01:13:18.854 --> 01:13:20.054
how did you get that in there?

01:13:20.078 --> 01:13:23.123
That's not an answer.

01:13:29.865 --> 01:13:34.536
My darling Indian princess,
will you marry me?

01:13:34.745 --> 01:13:36.497
Yes.

01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:37.915
I mean no.

01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:39.208
No?

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.001
You have to ask my father.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.210
Let's go.

01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:45.923
Oh, you don't know my father.

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:47.257
My dear,

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:49.426
I have camped in sub-zero
temperatures in Lapland.

01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:52.596
I have swam with crocodile
and piranha in Peru.

01:13:52.763 --> 01:13:54.890
I have climbed into the
mouth of a boiling volcano.

01:13:55.409 --> 01:13:56.409
I think I can...

01:13:56.433 --> 01:14:00.062
You don't know my father.

01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:06.819
I better go first and,
um, pave the way.

01:14:14.827 --> 01:14:15.827
Mama!

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:17.746
Hey.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:20.040
Where's Daddy?

01:14:20.249 --> 01:14:22.209
Well, he's not feeling too good.

01:14:22.418 --> 01:14:23.794
Something's happened.

01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:25.462
What?

01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:31.260
I still can't believe three
men came into Daddy's store

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:33.512
and took wares away.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.724
Just them things to
do with our culture.

01:14:37.933 --> 01:14:40.602
Did you call the sheriff?

01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:44.189
Honey, the government
was who took 'em,

01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:47.818
agents enforcing the
Code of Indian Offenses.

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:56.118
It's about all his
heart could take.

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.911
But he's a Thompson.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.746
He'll get through it.

01:15:02.124 --> 01:15:04.168
I'm going to tell
Clyde not to come.

01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:07.087
If you are serious
about this man,

01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:09.131
then we need to meet him.

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:12.009
Way to kick him when he's down.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:15.179
Hi, Daddy.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.228
Shame on the government.

01:15:23.437 --> 01:15:25.898
It's not right.

01:15:26.398 --> 01:15:28.609
Well, it's nothing new, sweetie.

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:31.361
You need anything?

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.780
Uh, water, thanks.

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:35.240
Okay.

01:15:49.338 --> 01:15:52.257
What's going to
happen to the store?

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:55.177
Oh, a small fine.

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:57.304
Trouble is those baskets
are made by locals

01:15:57.513 --> 01:16:00.557
who need money to put
food on the table.

01:16:00.766 --> 01:16:02.643
Any plans while you're home?

01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:05.938
Uh, Ms. Davis set up
a small performance

01:16:06.146 --> 01:16:08.649
at the local school.

01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:10.734
I was actually hoping, uh,

01:16:10.943 --> 01:16:13.612
Uncle Doug and Betty could come.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.448
Oh, I bet they'd be delighted.

01:16:16.657 --> 01:16:19.660
And maybe even Daddy
too, if he's...

01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:20.868
he's feeling better?

01:16:20.953 --> 01:16:22.120
Yeah.

01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:22.829
Yeah.

01:16:23.038 --> 01:16:24.581
We'll see about that.

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.790
Okay.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.894
Is she crazy?

01:16:46.103 --> 01:16:48.730
Now's not the time to be
promoting our culture.

01:16:48.939 --> 01:16:50.857
She feels it's exactly
the right time.

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:53.485
Well, it'll just
cause more trouble.

01:16:53.694 --> 01:16:56.947
Why can't she just
get a normal job?

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:58.824
Just thought I'd ask.

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:01.618
She's going to do it, so...

01:17:01.827 --> 01:17:04.580
Well, I don't need to see it.

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:06.498
Okay.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:36.958
Hi.

01:19:36.982 --> 01:19:37.983
Hi.

01:19:39.735 --> 01:19:41.862
Ever since I saw her perform,

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:44.364
I just knew.

01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:46.783
It took a little while for
fate to agree with me.

01:19:46.992 --> 01:19:48.432
Well, traveling here
must be nothing,

01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:49.541
when you travel everywhere.

01:19:53.165 --> 01:19:56.209
Mr. Thompson, I'm Clyde Fisher.

01:20:03.175 --> 01:20:09.765
Perhaps you shoulda gone
with Afraid of Bear.

01:20:09.973 --> 01:20:11.933
Let me try man to...

01:20:12.142 --> 01:20:14.394
boy.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.988
Shh.

01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:26.740
What's he saying?

01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:27.948
Shh.

01:20:28.158 --> 01:20:28.533
I...

01:20:28.742 --> 01:20:30.035
I don't know.

01:20:30.494 --> 01:20:34.122
And so, Mr. Thompson, I
would like your blessing

01:20:34.331 --> 01:20:38.251
to marry you daughter,
Mary Frances.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:44.257
How old are you?

01:20:44.466 --> 01:20:46.218
I am 17 years her senior.

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:50.013
The white hair came early.

01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:51.515
Hmm.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.476
You want to marry my daughter?

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:55.684
Yes, sir.

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.412
Well, I want you to
do something for me.

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.023
Anything.

01:21:00.232 --> 01:21:02.609
Bring her home.

01:21:02.818 --> 01:21:07.239
Have her stop all of this
globe trotting business.

01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:11.493
And if what you say is
true and you can provide,

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:15.831
then she can settle
down, nice and normal,

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:20.752
here, with her people.

01:21:21.962 --> 01:21:24.965
Sir, I'm not sure we're
talking about the same woman.

01:21:25.173 --> 01:21:26.550
To think that I would be able,

01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.134
if willing, which I'm not,

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:30.679
to put a leash on her,

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:34.140
well, in my opinion, that's
a quite impossible task.

01:21:37.269 --> 01:21:39.312
Yeah.

01:21:39.521 --> 01:21:44.234
Sounds like the same woman.

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:47.362
Mr. Thompson, your
daughter has a gift.

01:21:47.571 --> 01:21:49.698
She can open up the
eyes of the world

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:53.034
to the Chickasaw people,
to all Indians,

01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:55.996
simply by telling stories.

01:21:56.204 --> 01:21:58.582
I mean have you
seen her perform?

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:02.419
This is her home,

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:05.881
and she will always
come home to you.

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:11.052
If she can love me half
as much as she loves you,

01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:17.100
that will make me the
happiest man in the world.

01:22:22.606 --> 01:22:26.234
Mr. Thompson, I'm not asking
for an answer this instant,

01:22:26.443 --> 01:22:28.987
and I will wait as
long as it takes,

01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:31.948
and I will abide
by your decision.

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.179
Well?

01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:58.183
No answer yet.

01:22:58.391 --> 01:23:03.229
Well, I'm proud of
you, Afraid of Bear.

01:23:03.438 --> 01:23:05.231
Why don't you two go for a drive

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.359
and let me work
on old Papa Bear?

01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:10.570
I think I know just the place.

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:23.333
It's beautiful.

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:29.923
It has been my cathedral
since I was a child.

01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:41.101
Hmm.

01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:45.146
Long ago, my people,

01:23:45.355 --> 01:23:48.817
they were searching for
a place to call home.

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:54.864
Ahead of them was a great
white dog, Ofi Tohbi.

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.366
Ofi Tohbi?

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:59.411
Mm-hmm.

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:00.996
He traveled far ahead of them,

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:05.417
always on alert, and always
warned of any dangers.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:10.922
He was their faithful
guardian, scout.

01:24:11.131 --> 01:24:18.388
And then one day, they
came to a great river.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:22.392
They called it Misha Sipokoni.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.977
The Mississippi?

01:24:24.185 --> 01:24:26.688
Hmm.

01:24:27.439 --> 01:24:32.193
They knew home was
across the river.

01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:35.155
They knew home was somewhere
on the other side

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:38.616
of the wide, wide
river before them.

01:24:38.825 --> 01:24:43.663
So quickly, they assembled
rafts to cross.

01:24:43.872 --> 01:24:47.959
The first raft carried
a group of men

01:24:48.168 --> 01:24:52.630
and the beloved white dog.

01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:58.386
But the raft, it broke apart.

01:24:58.595 --> 01:25:02.974
All the men made it to shore,

01:25:03.183 --> 01:25:06.311
but the beloved white dog,

01:25:06.519 --> 01:25:10.565
standing proud on drifting wood,

01:25:10.774 --> 01:25:14.944
vanished down the river.

01:25:19.032 --> 01:25:20.912
Did they ever find out
what happened to the dog?

01:25:21.076 --> 01:25:24.287
No.

01:25:24.871 --> 01:25:30.210
But some say he can
still be seen,

01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:33.880
guiding our people.

01:25:51.231 --> 01:25:55.235
Deer.

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:11.126
I am sorry I had to kill
thee, little brother,

01:26:11.334 --> 01:26:14.462
but I had need of thy meat.

01:26:14.671 --> 01:26:21.427
I will do honor to thy courage,

01:26:21.636 --> 01:26:28.143
to thy strength,
and to thy beauty.

01:26:38.653 --> 01:26:42.448
Next I will tell you a story

01:26:42.657 --> 01:26:47.537
my father told me
when I was young.

01:26:47.745 --> 01:26:51.124
There are birds of many colors,

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:56.004
red, blue, green, and yellow,

01:26:56.212 --> 01:27:03.178
yet it is all one bird.

01:27:03.386 --> 01:27:07.432
There are horses of many colors,

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.478
black, brown, yellow, and white,

01:27:12.687 --> 01:27:17.734
yet it is all one horse.

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:20.069
So with cattle.

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:22.906
So with men.

01:27:23.114 --> 01:27:29.621
In this land, where
one was only Indian

01:27:31.956 --> 01:27:37.253
is now men of every color.

01:27:37.462 --> 01:27:43.885
All this came to pass in
the heart of the mystery.

01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:16.626
My name is Te Ata,
bearer of the morning.

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:21.214
I am Chickasaw!

01:28:21.422 --> 01:28:28.137
I am a storyteller.

01:28:49.367 --> 01:28:54.289
Remember who you are, Te Ata.

01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:55.623
Broadway will keep calling.

01:28:55.832 --> 01:28:58.501
Hollywood too.

01:28:58.668 --> 01:29:02.839
But you tell the story
you were meant to tell.

01:29:03.047 --> 01:29:04.549
I won't let you down.

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:07.343
Oh, don't you worry about me.

01:29:07.552 --> 01:29:09.637
You're doing it for them.

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:13.099
Hmm.

01:29:21.274 --> 01:29:23.651
Thank you for everything.

01:29:32.327 --> 01:29:33.494
Oh.

01:29:33.703 --> 01:29:35.079
And thank you.

01:29:35.288 --> 01:29:36.288
What for?

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.958
Helping me be me.

01:29:46.674 --> 01:29:48.509
Wish your father well.

01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:50.136
I will.

01:29:50.345 --> 01:29:51.137
And once he's better,

01:29:51.346 --> 01:29:53.348
I shall come back
to you, my love.

01:29:53.556 --> 01:29:55.516
I look forward to
both of those things.

01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:56.184
And write?

01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:57.392
Sorry.

01:29:57.518 --> 01:29:58.519
Write to me?

01:29:58.728 --> 01:30:00.021
Every day.

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:01.731
Your letters mean the world.

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.191
Oh!

01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:05.818
I almost forgot to
give these to you,

01:30:06.027 --> 01:30:09.781
your mail from Margaret.

01:30:11.449 --> 01:30:13.618
I love you, my princess.

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:17.497
And I love you, Afraid of Bear.

01:30:17.705 --> 01:30:18.873
Oh.

01:30:23.855 --> 01:30:24.855
All aboard!

01:30:24.879 --> 01:30:26.964
Last call!

01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:37.183
How is Daddy?

01:30:37.392 --> 01:30:39.644
Wasn't doing so good last night.

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:42.647
I could swear he'd been crying.

01:30:42.855 --> 01:30:45.566
But he's never cried
before a day in his life.

01:30:45.775 --> 01:30:46.818
I know.

01:30:47.026 --> 01:30:49.570
He's got me worried.

01:30:55.785 --> 01:30:59.080
What is it?

01:31:09.549 --> 01:31:11.592
The White House?

01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:15.721
President Roosevelt?

01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:17.932
Well, that's less than a week.

01:31:18.141 --> 01:31:19.517
Come here!

01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:20.768
Oh!

01:31:20.977 --> 01:31:22.437
Oh!

01:31:40.872 --> 01:31:45.626
I was invited to perform
at the White House

01:31:48.796 --> 01:31:56.796
for President Roosevelt's
first day dinner.

01:31:58.014 --> 01:32:04.187
But I won't go if you
promise not to die.

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:12.487
I'll stay right here with you.

01:32:21.204 --> 01:32:27.710
When you went to college,
I didn't like it.

01:32:27.919 --> 01:32:31.088
When you went on
that summer tour,

01:32:31.297 --> 01:32:34.008
I didn't like.

01:32:34.217 --> 01:32:39.430
Pittsburgh, no way.

01:32:39.639 --> 01:32:45.686
New York, nope.

01:32:45.895 --> 01:32:49.065
But I'll never forgive myself

01:32:49.273 --> 01:32:52.193
if you don't go to
that White House.

01:32:57.657 --> 01:33:00.493
I'm sorry.

01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:05.915
You know that first stomp
dance I ever took you to?

01:33:06.123 --> 01:33:14.123
That elder took you
aside and said

01:33:15.049 --> 01:33:19.220
"Ishnaakoot
shikonno'pa'ishanooli."

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:22.306
I remember.

01:33:22.515 --> 01:33:26.811
What he said was that some day

01:33:27.019 --> 01:33:31.357
you would become
the storyteller.

01:33:31.566 --> 01:33:34.569
I knew deep down
that he was right.

01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:36.821
But I was scared.

01:33:37.029 --> 01:33:39.699
I was selfish.

01:33:39.907 --> 01:33:42.243
I didn't want to share you.

01:33:45.705 --> 01:33:48.916
When you were just
a little girl,

01:33:49.125 --> 01:33:52.378
your Uncle Doug
went to Washington

01:33:52.587 --> 01:33:56.924
when they tried to
get rid of us...

01:33:57.133 --> 01:34:00.970
and now you will return
and show them that

01:34:01.178 --> 01:34:04.432
we are alive and well

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:11.314
and that the Chickasaw are
unconquered and unconquerable.

01:34:11.522 --> 01:34:14.692
Then you come back home

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.694
because we've got a
wedding to plan.

01:34:57.443 --> 01:35:01.280
Welcome, Te Ata.

01:35:01.489 --> 01:35:03.949
So pleased you're going
to be spending the night

01:35:04.158 --> 01:35:05.534
in the White House.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:06.702
Here...

01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:07.495
here to...

01:35:07.703 --> 01:35:08.204
tonight?

01:35:08.412 --> 01:35:09.705
Didn't they tell you?

01:35:09.914 --> 01:35:12.458
Oh, in the Lincoln Bedroom.

01:35:12.667 --> 01:35:14.877
We'll arrange for some things.

01:35:15.086 --> 01:35:17.838
Pardon me, Mrs. Roosevelt.

01:35:18.047 --> 01:35:22.259
My, you are looking ravishing.

01:35:22.468 --> 01:35:23.719
Senator Judd.

01:35:23.928 --> 01:35:24.928
Te Ata.

01:35:25.054 --> 01:35:27.723
You are very well
known to my people.

01:35:27.932 --> 01:35:29.058
Your people?

01:35:29.266 --> 01:35:33.521
You'll find out soon
enough, senator.

01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:36.857
Let me show you to your room.

01:35:43.114 --> 01:35:47.368
This evening would not
be complete without you.

01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:49.078
Do try to get a bit of rest

01:35:49.286 --> 01:35:53.582
before your performance
tonight, my dear.

01:35:55.459 --> 01:36:00.715
Mrs. Roosevelt, thank
you for everything.

01:36:00.923 --> 01:36:05.136
To my friends, I am Eleanor.

01:36:25.364 --> 01:36:31.328
Mr. Lincoln, there is an Indian
girl in the White House,

01:36:31.537 --> 01:36:34.957
and it's right that
she should be here.

01:36:38.335 --> 01:36:45.885
My name is Te Ata,
bearer of the morning.

01:36:46.093 --> 01:36:51.849
I am Chickasaw and
a storyteller,

01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:55.895
and this is the
story of my people.

01:36:56.103 --> 01:37:02.485
Long ago, the Great Creator
brought together two brothers,

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:06.322
the Choctaw and the Chickasaw.

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:11.702
The brothers sought out
new lands and journeyed

01:37:11.911 --> 01:37:18.167
with the protection of Ofi
Tohbi, the white dog.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:22.546
They brought with them
the sacred leaning pole

01:37:22.755 --> 01:37:27.092
that gave them direction.

01:37:27.301 --> 01:37:30.888
Finally, they found new lands

01:37:31.096 --> 01:37:34.558
and the one brother, Chickasaw,
went in one direction

01:37:34.767 --> 01:37:37.269
and Choctaw in the other.

01:37:37.478 --> 01:37:45.361
And by doing this, they
created two powerful nations.

01:37:45.569 --> 01:37:49.573
And they sang a song.

01:38:55.639 --> 01:38:58.976
Ababinili walks in good ways.

01:38:59.184 --> 01:39:01.145
He reminds us through
our ancestors

01:39:01.353 --> 01:39:04.690
how all of this
beauty came to be.

01:39:07.985 --> 01:39:10.905
Mi, yammak illa -

01:39:11.113 --> 01:39:14.116
