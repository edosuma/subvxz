Sorry, sis.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.359
Whoo!

12:39.392 --> 12:42.295
See, I knew the double cupie
would get 'em.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.531
You shoulda just tried
that stunt again.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.766
You woulda scored
more difficulty points.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.169
I wouldna stuck it noways.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.904
My feet are too big.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.974
Well, I can hold a 7 1/2
in the palm of my hand...

12:54.007 --> 12:56.209
even on a bad day.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.111
Which it was for me.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.881
Well, there's always next year.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.917
What's the use?
You woulda graduated by then.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.285
<i>Maine, fuck this shit!</i>

13:05.318 --> 13:06.486

They get detention?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.530
<i>Naw. Suspended.</i>

13:16.563 --> 13:18.231
No homecoming game for them.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.401
Yeah? What about you?
Didn't you start it?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.336
Naw, I finished it.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.572
Plus, Chucalissa High

13:25.805 --> 13:28.175

Cheer Championship, so...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.179
I'll see ya around.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.115
Oh...

13:36.816 --> 13:40.820
I don't know what the heyell
those guys were talkin' about.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.890
You ain't nowhere near "threw,"
if you ask me.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.427
<i>She ain't
expect her Prince Charmin'</i>

13:47.460 --> 13:49.429
<i>to appear in this here book.</i>

13:49.462 --> 13:51.231
<i>She ain't think
she was deservin'</i>

13:51.264 --> 13:53.400
<i>of a Prince Charmin' at all.</i>

13:53.433 --> 13:55.402
<i>Let her stepmother tell it,</i>

13:55.435 --> 13:58.205
<i>she was destined
to serve the pretty,</i>

13:58.238 --> 14:00.140
<i>not be the pretty.</i>

14:00.173 --> 14:02.075
<i>Cuz, see, stepmother thought</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:03.543
<i>she was givin' her a chore
that she hated.</i>

14:03.577 --> 14:06.546
<i>I mean, who the fuck want
to be playin' cosmetologist</i>

14:06.580 --> 14:09.549
<i>on a Friday night
and not gettin' paid, too?</i>

14:09.583 --> 14:11.318
<i>Bitch!</i>

14:11.351 --> 14:14.187
<i>But Keyshawn, she loved
to play with they crowns.</i>

14:14.221 --> 14:17.490
Mm-mm, sit down and get yo'
fuckin' hair done, girl.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.392
Fine.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.294
I'll do the ponytail,

14:21.328 --> 14:22.929
<i>but I don't wanna play
the flute</i>

14:22.963 --> 14:24.331
<i>for the talent portion.</i>

14:24.364 --> 14:26.333
<i>One day, with enough money,</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:30.136
<i>she'd be able to play
for a 3C Peruvian Silky</i>

14:30.170 --> 14:32.272
<i>with Brazilian mix.</i>

14:32.305 --> 14:34.975
<i>Mmm!</i>

14:35.008 --> 14:36.476
<i>Some bitches
gotta work for they pretty.</i>

14:36.509 --> 14:38.144
<i>These bitches inherited it.</i>

14:40.113 --> 14:41.514
Pageant, practice...

14:41.548 --> 14:43.083
I need an assistant

14:43.116 --> 14:46.253
to keep up
with y'all's appointments.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.555
Raising two girls
is a lot of work.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.556
Three.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.594
- You're raising three.
- <i>Oh...</i>

14:54.628 --> 14:57.397
Ha. Yes, of course.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.099
Thass what I meant.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.101
I have to get used to
that new number.

15:01.134 --> 15:05.138
- Well, luck comes in threes.
- So does death.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.140
You should go to cosmetology
school, Keyshawn.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.342
Cosmetology school?

15:09.376 --> 15:12.178
- My daddy would have a fit.
- Oh, speakin' of...

15:12.212 --> 15:15.181
when is James coming back
from his business trip?

15:15.215 --> 15:17.450
Right in time for the pageant,
he said.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.419
We are all gone be there.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.222
<i>Front row.</i>

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Unh-uh.</i>

15:29.362 --> 15:31.097
Now, that is five dollars
in the jar.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.034
Oh, shit, Keyshawn...

15:34.067 --> 15:36.136
What did you do? What did you--

15:36.169 --> 15:38.705
- What's happenin'?
- Oh, my goodness.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.973
Let me see this hair.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.007
Alisha, what's goin' on?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.185
Well...

15:52.218 --> 15:54.954
I can-I can fix it.
Maybe some--a quick weave--

15:54.988 --> 15:56.990
Unlike you,
she doesn't need a weave.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.958
This girl the color
a yellow-wasted,

15:58.992 --> 16:00.994

For the record,
ours is called MISTLE-toe.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.455
The heyell it is.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.490
Since Chucalissa High's

17:40.293 --> 17:42.762

18:55.602 --> 18:57.604
My dad thought I was gay,

18:57.637 --> 19:01.608
but I was like,
"Man, if you only knew.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.643

19:04.911 --> 19:07.614
Well, it's official.
I got the call.

I'ma be co-captain

Like...wow.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.393
Well, if we had to, we could,

Shoe dug

19:41.848 --> 19:43.583
Can I?

19:53.626 --> 19:56.429
You should wear makeup,
cover it up.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.267
I shouldn't look too beautiful.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.435

20:12.879 --> 20:15.515
I just got my hair fixed.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.285
I don't know if my Prius
quite counts as a chariot.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.922
Can I get y'all somethin' else?

20:22.956 --> 20:25.858
I'll have another order

Is this a date?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.962
Well... not exactly.

21:02.996 --> 21:07.300
I-I wouldn't take you
on a first date to Taffy's.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.036
So where would you
take me, then?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.608
Eat snow cones downtown.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.810
Maybe dinner on a riverboat.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.613
Hmm.

21:32.492 --> 21:36.362
That all sounds nice, but...

21:36.396 --> 21:37.797
would you take me home?

21:49.475 --> 21:51.644
Sucks you didn't make
the team this year.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.547
Yeah.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.717
You wouldn't be able to

23:11.824 --> 23:13.559
<i>You'll learn one day.</i>

Everything ain't always

some fuckin' fairy tale.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.938
Excuse me?

23:28.808 --> 23:31.644
Keyshawn,
you don't know everything.

23:31.677 --> 23:32.979
What I do know

23:33.012 --> 23:35.548
is that you're a homewrecker
turned homemaker.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.817
<i>Unh-uh.</i>

beg for the bark.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.558
<i>Both of 'em knew it...</i>

31:38.330 --> 31:42.468
<i>hungry for the softness

31:42.501 --> 31:45.304
<i>Or lust...</i>

31:45.337 --> 31:48.040
<i>Same thang.</i>

32:14.500 --> 32:17.469

<i>I'm talkin' 'bout
three percent off gross.</i>

40:41.072 --> 40:42.841
That's cool, but it's...

40:42.874 --> 40:44.876
three percent off
a small customer base.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.778
What the fuck you mean?

40:46.812 --> 40:49.447
I mean... I really wanted

46:27.919 --> 46:31.055
No. You made a choice.

46:31.089 --> 46:35.326
And you have to own up
to your choices.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.297

47:21.306 --> 47:23.908
Wait, wait, wait. Say whu?

47:26.277 --> 47:29.847
All this time,

47:36.120 --> 47:39.157
You ain't

47:39.190 --> 47:42.260
Naive, maybe, ambitious, even,

47:42.293 --> 47:43.561
but stupid?

47:43.595 --> 47:45.463
That--that ain't true.

47:57.275 --> 47:58.643
Everything.

<i>Where are good

<i>Do they only live
in the future?</i>

48:48.660 --> 48:51.996
<i>Do they even exist?</i>

48:52.030 --> 48:54.632
<i>The creaks in the floor
only echo the fact</i>

48:54.666 --> 48:57.168
<i>that these questions
remain unanswered</i>

<i>for bitches like us.</i>

48:59.370 --> 49:02.640
<i>But the need for the answer

49:41.713 --> 49:44.349
I promise.

49:45.750 --> 49:48.686
I'm gonna be better than him.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.389
Better than my dad ever was.

49:54.425 --> 49:57.695
I know, baby.

50:01.566 --> 50:02.734
I know.

50:04.302 --> 50:07.605

You want some hot dog?
Hmm? Hmm?

<i>Yeah. Yeah, ya hungry?</i>

50:25.323 --> 50:27.125
<i>Ya hungry?</i>

50:27.158 --> 50:29.727
<i>Yeah, my little
flying plane, huh?</i>

50:29.761 --> 50:31.629
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

50:31.662 --> 50:35.767
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

50:35.800 --> 50:38.536
<i>- Hey, hey, it's okay.</i>

50:38.569 --> 50:41.806
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

50:42.039 --> 50:44.609
Hey, y'all, look, it's Mama!

50:44.642 --> 50:46.778
Mama's home, huh?

50:46.811 --> 50:48.646
Hey. Hey, baby.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.348
Good to see you.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.583
Hey, look. Looky there.

It's Mama. It's Mama.

50:57.622 --> 51:01.125
<i>Jayden, Mama's home, huh?</i>

51:04.061 --> 51:05.730
It's num-num time.

51:05.763 --> 51:08.733
- Come, come...
- No!

51:10.368 --> 51:12.770
Here you go, babe.

51:12.804 --> 51:16.374
Yeah. Yes.

51:16.407 --> 51:17.708
Yeah.

51:17.742 --> 51:20.077
Why you back home so early?

51:20.111 --> 51:24.816
Rome wanted us to take a break
to re-jigger the tour.

51:24.849 --> 51:27.385
But he called me
about an extension.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.687
<i>True, true, but...</i>

51:29.720 --> 51:33.257
he needed to rework
the schedule a bit.

51:33.291 --> 51:35.860
It was all so sudden.

51:40.131 --> 51:42.099
Hey. Jayden.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.336
What's wrong?

51:45.369 --> 51:48.773
He's just been
really missing you, I think.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.111
Jayden, you okay?

51:58.115 --> 52:00.117
There ya go.

52:00.151 --> 52:01.519
What was that?

52:01.552 --> 52:02.887
It's nothin' to worry about.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.655
They call this
nursemaid's elbow.

52:04.689 --> 52:06.757
- What that is?
- Ah, it's nothin'--

52:06.791 --> 52:08.459
just an elbow joint dislocation.

52:08.493 --> 52:09.794
<i>It's pretty common.</i>

52:09.827 --> 52:12.296
<i>Happens to a lotta kids
cuz their bones so soft.</i>

52:12.330 --> 52:14.699
Dr. Patterson.

52:22.306 --> 52:24.809
Oh, is that tender?

52:36.153 --> 52:37.755
<i>Hey.</i>

52:37.788 --> 52:40.791
<i>Thank God you're back.</i>

52:45.463 --> 52:48.533
I was just about to head out.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.368
I got this interview
this morning.

53:19.864 --> 53:22.366
You haven't asked me
what the doctor said.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.904
What'd the doctor say?

53:26.938 --> 53:29.807
Jayden's only
three years old, Derrick.

53:33.511 --> 53:35.413
What'd the doctor say?

53:35.446 --> 53:37.782
You dislocated
his elbow, Derrick.

53:37.815 --> 53:39.550
Th-that's impossible.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.791
There it is, right there.

53:50.928 --> 53:52.730
I didn't do anything.

53:52.763 --> 53:54.966
You know what?
You can hit me.

53:54.999 --> 53:56.901
You can beat me.

53:56.934 --> 54:00.271
But you will not...
you will NOT beat my children!

54:00.304 --> 54:02.974
Okay! Okay,
so he's gettin' spankings.

54:03.007 --> 54:05.276
Derrick, he's three years old!

54:05.309 --> 54:07.345
He's driving me INSANE, Key.

54:07.378 --> 54:09.614
I mean, he's fuckin' whinin',

54:09.647 --> 54:11.449
<i>temper tantrum
all the fuckin' time--</i>

54:11.482 --> 54:13.918
Well, what do you fuckin' expect?
Babies cry!

54:13.951 --> 54:15.453
Yeah, well, it's too much sometimes!

54:15.486 --> 54:16.887
What do you--what do you mean
it's too much?

54:16.921 --> 54:18.522
You have to comfort him.

54:18.556 --> 54:21.692
You have not been with these
fuckin' kids for two weeks!

54:21.726 --> 54:23.894
TWO WEEKS!

54:23.928 --> 54:26.397
And, YES, they get spankings,

54:26.430 --> 54:29.667
just LIKE I GOT 'EM
when I was their age.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.269

54:32.303 --> 54:34.805
You will not beat my kids
like yo' daddy beat you!

54:36.307 --> 54:38.442
He's only three years old, Derrick.

54:38.476 --> 54:39.710
Doesn't matter.

54:39.744 --> 54:41.412
You have to straighten
a tree when it's young,

54:41.445 --> 54:43.347
and that's what my dad
did to me.

54:43.381 --> 54:45.750
Yeah, after he made you peel
a switch offa it?!

54:45.783 --> 54:47.485
You are not him.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.654
You are so much better!

54:49.687 --> 54:51.756
You could be so much better!

54:51.789 --> 54:53.758
- Keyshawn, just fade on back.
- This'll leave scars

54:53.791 --> 54:55.693
that you will never know.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.728
- Scars that never heal.
- Keyshawn, STOP already

54:57.762 --> 54:58.963
so I can get ready
for this interview!

54:58.996 --> 55:01.399
Why? YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT!

55:01.432 --> 55:03.701
But it's all good.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.069
I'll just keep taking care

55:05.302 --> 55:07.605

Anywhere but my face!

55:59.657 --> 56:00.991
Anywhere!

56:01.025 --> 56:03.994
Please! Anywhere!

56:26.817 --> 56:31.655
I will discipline my children
any way I want to.

56:42.399 --> 56:45.402
<i>This is your fuckin' fault!</i>

56:46.971 --> 56:48.839
<i>Fuckin' tolju!</i>

56:50.975 --> 56:54.145

<i>Keep your eyes open,</i>

57:08.526 --> 57:11.662
<i>cuz the Devil can be an angel

Yo' body won't be like

<i>Her body had hung

<i>...her body had rotted

1:00:42.773 --> 1:00:44.408
Hmph.

1:00:46.710 --> 1:00:49.747
Death can be obvious...

1:00:49.780 --> 1:00:52.983
but she can also be
a sneaky-ass bitch.

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:55.219
[gags, coughs] Hold on, Woddy...

1:00:57.921 --> 1:01:01.358

<i>That ain't what I heard.</i>

1:01:21.111 --> 1:01:24.448

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:40.330
Most folks don't get this.

1:01:40.364 --> 1:01:42.699
Don't get somebody to...

1:01:42.733 --> 1:01:44.735
lead 'em to the other side.

1:01:44.768 --> 1:01:47.104
[wheezes, chokes] <i>- You know...</i>

<i>This ain't no fairy tale.</i>

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:42.459
<i>This the real world.</i>

1:02:42.493 --> 1:02:44.895
<i>And in the real world,
all us got the power</i>

1:02:44.928 --> 1:02:46.997

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:50.367
<i>Handsome princes can become
fire-breathin' dragons.</i>

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:53.036
<i>Trusty sidekicks

1:02:53.070 --> 1:02:57.508
<i>and even damsels can become
they own damn saviors.</i>
