WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.383
Naomi! Naomi!

00:09.468 --> 00:11.720
Naomi! Naomi!

00:15.349 --> 00:17.142
Naomi!

00:17.226 --> 00:19.603
Naomi! Naomi!

00:19.686 --> 00:22.439
She'll be washed up in the mud
just like her sister.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
Taken for her sins.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.694
Naomi!

00:42.459 --> 00:45.087
Nothing. We're still looking.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.507
I'm sorry.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.806
She will come home, Henry. I'm sure of it.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.058
You said the same thing about Gracie.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.142
Henry--

03:15.529 --> 03:16.613
Any sign of her?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.828
Jo.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.516
What's going on?

03:49.479 --> 03:50.981
We have to go to London.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.611
-Why?
-Dr. Garrett.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.739
He said he'd see me
without an appointment.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.699
Appointment? For what?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.243
I'm sick, Will.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.082
The flu?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.918
It's more than that.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.884
Well, I don't--

04:18.966 --> 04:21.845
The weather has been so…

04:23.305 --> 04:24.348
cold and wet.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.933
-You're bound to--
-I'm weak.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.395
And I'm getting weaker.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.485
I'm trying to hide it.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.530
Stella, why?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.576
Why? I would have--

04:44.660 --> 04:46.286
-It's all right.
-No, Stella.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.163
I trust Dr. Garrett.

04:55.879 --> 04:56.880
Right.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.801
You--

05:01.635 --> 05:03.428
You want to see Dr. Garrett?

05:05.222 --> 05:06.223
In London?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.815
We can take the children.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.942
Make an adventure of it.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.655
An adventure?

05:21.738 --> 05:22.739
Why not?

05:29.705 --> 05:30.873
We could see Cora.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.216
No. I--

05:42.342 --> 05:45.095
-I don't--
-We need somewhere to stay.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.059
We'll stay with Charles.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.772
We'll leave in the morning.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.267
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY SARAH PERRY

06:40.776 --> 06:43.278
THE ESSEX SERPENT

06:59.461 --> 07:00.587
I don't want it.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.979
When is she gonna come out of her room?

07:17.062 --> 07:18.355
Soon.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.607
MRS. SEABORNE,
2 FOULIS ST. WESTMINSTER LONDON

07:26.738 --> 07:27.990
Very soon, I hope.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.551
How are you this morning?

07:49.178 --> 07:50.179
Fine.

08:20.584 --> 08:25.172
They want to meet me…
See my find, the plesiosaur.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.883
You better get up then.

08:29.801 --> 08:30.844
But how did they--

08:31.887 --> 08:35.097
I won't see you broken
by a village consumed by superstition.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.229
You wrote to the society in my name?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.359
Frankie's been asking for you.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.486
Every single mealtime.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.286
He can come with me.
We'll go on the Underground.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.929
Was there any other post for me?

09:14.429 --> 09:15.430
No.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.307
Nothing from Aldwinter?

09:18.267 --> 09:19.268
Still, no.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.046
Look.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.592
SKELETAL DISPLAY - BLUE WHALE
BRITISH MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY

09:51.675 --> 09:53.218
Can we go and see it?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.054
Not today.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.806
I've got an appointment.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.866
ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY

10:23.540 --> 10:25.250
Are there any serpents here?

10:25.334 --> 10:29.087
Not yet. Maybe one day,
if I've found the remains of one.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.840
Professor Marchant.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.259
Cora Seaborne.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.429
Hello.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.514
Please.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.105
Please.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.328
I wouldn't presume
to categorize it myself,

11:01.912 --> 11:04.915
but nonetheless, I do believe
it could be some sort of plesiosaur.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.126
Not one I've seen before, and I've looked
through all the published material.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.634
And you just stumbled across it?

11:16.718 --> 11:20.138
No, I was digging
on the Essex coast for some time.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.231
I'm impressed.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.068
Do you have more?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.364
No, this is it at present.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.241
That's a shame.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.250
I can't do anything with just this piece.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.796
You know what you're doing.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.382
You should return and look for more.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.098
Thank you for your time.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.434
Go back to Essex, Mrs. Seaborne.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.770
We want to find the serpent.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.439
Someone's keen.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.488
Why can't we go back to Aldwinter?

12:18.572 --> 12:19.823
We can't, Frankie.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.535
Shall I?

12:23.619 --> 12:25.662
No, I can manage.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.686
-Frankie, are you all right?
-I'm freezing.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.355
Run upstairs and get changed.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.692
Cora, this is my friend, Sali.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.986
Mrs. Cora Seaborne.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.112
Hello.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.364
Pleased to meet you.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.617
I hope you're coming next week?

13:04.910 --> 13:07.162
With Ambrose? To my home?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.749
Martha tells me he listens to you.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.000
Oh, yes.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.296
Sorry, I'm so tired.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.264
Feel free to borrow an umbrella.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.785
The find is worthless.

13:46.869 --> 13:47.995
What?

13:49.371 --> 13:51.498
Unless I go back to find more.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.041
You can't.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.170
No, definitely not.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.423
You need to forget about Essex.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.551
You shouldn't have
sent me to meet the professor.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.886
I was trying to help.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.596
Why?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.056
I want you to come back.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.559
And I'm trying.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.643
Are you?

14:13.437 --> 14:15.772
Lying in bed all day, refusing to eat?

14:15.856 --> 14:18.025
Brokenhearted over a married man?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.695
We need to get back to normal.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.947
We need to make a proper home for Frankie.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.449
-Do we?
-Yes.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.867
We have to open up the house,

14:26.950 --> 14:29.661
and then we need to start
thinking about his education.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.330
-We have to try and--
-"We, we."

14:31.413 --> 14:33.957
You speak about us like we're a couple.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.089
-What I mean is--
-I'm merely your servant.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.425
No. My friend.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.385
You can't pay for friendship.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.470
What?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.430
-Where are you going?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.724
Would it be all right
if I take a half-day, ma'am?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.226
What?

14:52.726 --> 14:53.894
Martha?

14:56.772 --> 14:58.899
-Where's Martha gone?
-I don't know.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.859
-When's she coming back?
-I don't know.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.611
-Has she gone to Essex?
-No!

15:06.365 --> 15:07.491
I'm sorry.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.703
I tell you what,
should we go and see the whale?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.289
When?

15:15.791 --> 15:16.792
Tomorrow.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.424
I'll have to pretend I didn't mean it.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.426
-Make up with her.
-Why?

15:26.510 --> 15:29.054
-I don't have a choice.
-There's always a choice.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.807
-Martha.
-No.

15:31.890 --> 15:35.644
You wouldn't understand
how it feels to have no power of your own.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.897
I think you're immensely powerful.

15:40.566 --> 15:43.569
She's agreed to come with us.
She must respect you.

15:43.652 --> 15:46.738
But we used to spend every day together.
Talking, sharing.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.448
I thought she felt the same.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.450
Sounds like you're in love with her.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.874
Everyone else is.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.635
John, we're off.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.764
There's blood on the boats!

16:21.106 --> 16:22.107
Who did it?

16:23.525 --> 16:24.651
Evansford.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.446
Why?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.115
He thinks it'll protect us.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.325
So we're in danger?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.035
No.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.205
-Is that why we're going to London?
-No.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.404
Naomi will come home.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.866
We have to keep faith.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.862
What are you drawing, John?

17:51.572 --> 17:52.614
It's the whale.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.910
You can show it to Charles
when we get there.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.037
Why can't we go straight to the museum?

18:00.706 --> 18:02.916
Your father and I have business
in town this morning.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.919
-Can't we go and see Cora?
-No.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.881
We'll see her soon, I'm sure.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.041
And a little deeper.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.059
Don't look so alarmed.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.061
I'm all right.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.273
Would you mind coughing one more time,
then spitting into this dish?

19:24.331 --> 19:25.666
Now what?

19:26.750 --> 19:30.045
Now I'll stain the bacillus,
so I can see it under the microscope.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.044
Can I look?

20:12.129 --> 20:13.130
Of course.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.893
Like grains of rice.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.354
So blue.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.150
So beautiful.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.652
Unfortunately, it's tuberculosis.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.071
-No.
-I'm so sorry.

20:41.366 --> 20:45.329
-The doctor in Aldwinter said--
-The doctor in Aldwinter is a fool.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.413
Luke.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.833
-We're going. Come on.
-Please, wait.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.669
There is a treatment.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.383
A therapeutic pneumothorax.

20:59.468 --> 21:04.014
It's radical, but if you ask me,
it is her best and only hope.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.478
What is it?

21:11.313 --> 21:14.691
I would operate
to collapse the infected lung

21:14.775 --> 21:16.777
in order to give it
the best chance of healing.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.905
It's never been done successfully before.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.698
Then, no. Absolutely not.

21:21.782 --> 21:25.786
-Don't sacrifice her to your fears.
-You think I'd let you chop her up

21:25.869 --> 21:28.330
like a piece of offal in a butcher shop?

21:28.413 --> 21:29.706
There are other options.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.834
I would recommend
injections of tuberculin--

21:31.917 --> 21:34.127
-Very low success rate.
-They have worked in Germany.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.712
Surgery, I honestly think--

21:35.796 --> 21:37.297
She's not one of your cadavers,
Dr. Garrett.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.799
-She's my wife.
-Stop.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.720
This is my disease.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.688
And I don't want to be treated.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.945
Then you must know what's ahead,
Mrs. Ransome.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.866
Some good days, but bad ones too.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.749
Weakness.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.376
Delirium.

22:16.587 --> 22:17.588
Thank you.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.884
I'd like to speak with my husband, please.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.526
Stella.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.780
I've made up my mind.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.578
I don't want to spend my precious time
in a hospital.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.539
Away from…

22:53.123 --> 22:54.291
What should I do?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.591
Take the children on their day out.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.679
They've been looking forward to it.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.726
Then we'll go home.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.608
Charles is expecting us at--

23:19.691 --> 23:22.861
I'll go and see him now.
Rest there for the day.

23:42.381 --> 23:43.382
Dad?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.719
Are you all right?

23:48.637 --> 23:49.763
Yes.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.434
Go and find your brother.

24:50.866 --> 24:51.909
Stay here, all right?

24:53.827 --> 24:54.912
Will.

24:55.746 --> 24:56.788
You came to London.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.042
The children wanted to see the whale.

25:01.251 --> 25:04.463
Of course. Yes.
Frankie's obsessed with it.

25:06.465 --> 25:07.758
Like mother, like son.

25:10.928 --> 25:11.970
I've been thinking about--

25:12.054 --> 25:13.305
Cora.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.186
Why did you leave?

25:23.524 --> 25:25.692
Frankie got homesick. That's all.

25:26.276 --> 25:27.778
Cora, you're acting strange.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.071
I'm sorry.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.200
How are you all? How's your mother?

25:33.867 --> 25:35.202
-She's--
-Where's John?

25:36.370 --> 25:37.454
We should--

25:37.538 --> 25:38.956
We should go home.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.003
Goodbye, Mrs. Seaborne.

26:03.856 --> 26:05.274
You're shaking, Mummy.

26:17.411 --> 26:20.664
-Cora, what's happened?
-Leave me.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.599
I'm going to see if Naomi's back.

26:38.682 --> 26:39.683
Jo?

26:43.770 --> 26:45.147
Let her go.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.071
Come back, Naomi.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.156
Come back.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.906
Is this my judgment?

28:20.576 --> 28:22.202
I keep thinking it must be.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.291
For what?

28:28.166 --> 28:30.669
We've never had any secrets
from each other, have we?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.008
Never.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.225
There's something I haven't told you.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.110
There's someone I--

28:55.194 --> 28:56.195
Hush.

29:07.456 --> 29:10.083
You're a good man, Will Ransome.

29:30.521 --> 29:32.814
Should we just forget about our row?

29:34.691 --> 29:36.026
I am trying.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.824
You need to decide what you want.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.663
Stop dwelling on what you can't have.

29:54.711 --> 29:55.712
Cora.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.632
Hello. Thanks for coming.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.261
Thought you were still in Essex.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.055
No, I left some time ago.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.684
Why didn't you write?

30:09.560 --> 30:10.853
Why didn't you?

30:10.936 --> 30:12.980
I'm totally unreliable. I have an excuse.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.774
It's good to see you.

30:20.863 --> 30:22.072
So what happened?

30:22.781 --> 30:26.034
They all turned against me.
Decided I was the devil.

30:26.118 --> 30:28.245
What? Even the dear reverend?

30:29.037 --> 30:30.289
No, he--

30:32.833 --> 30:35.794
Anyhow, I'm here
to talk to you about something else.

30:36.503 --> 30:39.214
Remember the party? The thing with Martha?

30:41.091 --> 30:42.092
Martha?

30:43.093 --> 30:44.178
And Sali?

30:46.346 --> 30:47.514
Sali?

30:47.598 --> 30:49.057
Your patient's sister.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.938
Our visit to the slums.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.773
Luke, it's important.

30:56.857 --> 30:59.193
I need to support Martha.
You have to come.

30:59.735 --> 31:01.778
-Really?
-Yes.

31:01.862 --> 31:03.071
You're Nev's doctor.

31:03.155 --> 31:05.657
If you talk to Ambrose,
he'll have to listen.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.075
Please, Luke.

31:07.159 --> 31:09.411
Problem is, I have a prior engagement.

31:11.747 --> 31:13.457
The annual BMA party.

31:13.540 --> 31:14.750
Well, don't go then.

31:15.918 --> 31:18.003
But they're giving me an award.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.214
Luke, that's wonderful.

31:20.297 --> 31:22.049
Admit it, you're thrilled.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.803
I suppose I could squeeze them both in

31:26.887 --> 31:28.680
if I had a friend in tow.

31:31.558 --> 31:32.893
It would be an honor.

31:39.191 --> 31:41.276
I'm not really one for jewelry.

31:42.861 --> 31:44.112
But thank you.

31:47.074 --> 31:49.451
Just as well. I couldn't afford it anyway.

32:03.674 --> 32:04.842
Morning.

32:05.843 --> 32:06.844
What's this?

32:07.344 --> 32:08.637
The least I can do.

32:09.429 --> 32:10.430
Thank you.

32:18.146 --> 32:21.358
Will you come with me to collect Luke?
Make sure he doesn't wiggle out of it.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.821
I think I should have breakfast
with Frankie.

32:29.658 --> 32:32.244
Luke. Martha's here.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.251
Luke.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.300
Why would you be so cruel?

32:46.383 --> 32:47.384
Martha's here.

32:48.969 --> 32:50.053
God.

32:54.516 --> 32:55.517
Good morning.

32:57.561 --> 32:58.687
You look well.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.063
Ready?

33:00.147 --> 33:01.148
Well…

33:03.483 --> 33:05.360
Look, I've been working all night.

33:05.444 --> 33:07.571
I really don't feel up to it.

33:09.072 --> 33:11.408
-Up. Up.
-To be honest with you--

33:13.744 --> 33:14.870
A strong coffee?

33:15.454 --> 33:16.830
-What do you think?
-Yes.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.798
You haven't told him, have you? About…

33:27.716 --> 33:29.051
'Course I haven't.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.845
Good. Because anyone can see
how keen he is on you.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.518
By the way, I've been meaning to ask.
Did I--

33:38.018 --> 33:39.561
I mean, was I any good?

33:41.939 --> 33:43.524
Forgotten about it already.

33:47.236 --> 33:49.821
You women really know
how to destroy a man.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.659
I hope you're not still pining for Cora.

33:56.078 --> 33:57.246
Luke,

33:57.746 --> 33:59.581
don't waste your love on her.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.792
She won't know what to do with it.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.211
Here we are.

34:15.722 --> 34:16.931
Right.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.601
Let's get this over with.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.121
As you can see, Mr. Ambrose,

34:39.204 --> 34:41.581
this isn't a good place
to recover from surgery.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.793
Perhaps our guest
would like a drink of water.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.354
The well is not clean.

35:04.438 --> 35:07.608
-Sulfuretted hydrogen in the water.
-What was that, Luke?

35:09.943 --> 35:11.028
Poisonous gas.

35:11.111 --> 35:13.113
See, it's blackened the window frames.

35:18.285 --> 35:21.330
So, where do you
dispose of your pots, Sali?

35:21.914 --> 35:25.375
The sewages outside,
or further down if that one is overflowed.

35:25.459 --> 35:26.502
Do you have vermin?

35:26.585 --> 35:27.878
Of course they do.

35:29.922 --> 35:30.923
Thank you.

35:32.758 --> 35:34.092
It's been

35:35.260 --> 35:37.763
very informative.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.066
Don't walk away, Charles.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.484
I said I would come, and I have.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.654
-You have the power to help them.
-And we have, Cora.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.531
We've legislated over it again.

35:55.614 --> 35:57.032
The Clearances Act--

35:57.115 --> 36:00.327
You can't just tear down the slums
and leave people homeless.

36:00.410 --> 36:01.495
What would you suggest?

36:01.578 --> 36:03.121
We need a social housing bill.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.124
The communist emerges.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.876
People are dying, Ambrose.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.170
The only thing
that survives here is disease.

36:10.254 --> 36:11.672
You survived.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.757
-For goodness' sake, Charles.
-Wha--

36:13.841 --> 36:17.719
Do you have any idea what it's like
to actually die from cholera?

36:17.803 --> 36:20.389
A pathogen is swilling
in the sewers right under our feet.

36:20.472 --> 36:23.100
So, first,
you lose control of your bowels,

36:23.767 --> 36:25.894
you vomit night and day,

36:25.978 --> 36:28.230
your eyes sink to the back of your skull,

36:28.313 --> 36:30.023
and your skin turns blue.

36:32.818 --> 36:35.737
It is a frightening, lonely death.

36:36.989 --> 36:38.740
Clean water is a basic human right.

36:40.284 --> 36:42.870
If we're not agreed on that,
then you should be on your way.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.546
I'll talk to colleagues.

36:53.172 --> 36:54.590
See if I can raise a bill.

37:01.346 --> 37:02.598
Luke's downstairs.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.517
It hardly feels right to go out.

37:06.268 --> 37:08.228
No, don't stay in feeling guilty.

37:08.312 --> 37:09.354
Take action.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.273
You could join the movement.

37:11.773 --> 37:13.400
You were brilliant, Martha.

37:14.276 --> 37:15.444
You're wasted here.

37:17.487 --> 37:19.615
-I do wanna do more.
-You must.

37:21.283 --> 37:23.744
I suppose you and Frankie
won't need me forever, will you?

37:26.747 --> 37:28.207
Be careful with Luke.

37:29.499 --> 37:30.501
We're friends.

37:54.399 --> 37:56.151
Shall we go and toast your success?

37:56.860 --> 37:59.780
By which I mean get very, very drunk.

38:03.408 --> 38:05.035
Whoa, whoa.

38:26.390 --> 38:27.599
Absolutely…

38:35.315 --> 38:36.316
Dr. Garrett.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.235
-Oh, God. The chairman of the board.
-Garrett?

38:38.318 --> 38:41.029
We really should go get drunk
in a bar somewhere.

38:41.113 --> 38:43.615
This is your night.
We're going to enjoy it.

38:43.699 --> 38:44.783
Garrett.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.411
Garrett, congratulations.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.745
I do my best.

38:49.663 --> 38:53.333
-And is this your daughter?
-Mr. Garrett, behave yourself.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.169
Impossible, sadly.

38:55.252 --> 38:58.422
You must be Mrs. Garrett.
How lovely to meet you.

38:58.505 --> 39:00.090
The pleasure is all mine.

39:02.384 --> 39:05.762
And now I must practice my speech
on my dear wife.

39:07.556 --> 39:08.557
Hello.

39:15.647 --> 39:19.318
It is with the utmost
respect and humility…

39:19.401 --> 39:21.695
-Humility? Really?
-…that I accept…

39:28.744 --> 39:31.205
I needed this. Thank you.

39:31.288 --> 39:33.665
Always available for wanton drinking.

39:35.334 --> 39:37.961
-Christ, I am legless.
-Are you?

39:38.045 --> 39:40.339
And it's all your fault, Mrs. Garrett.

39:50.432 --> 39:52.726
What is this, Cora? What are we doing?

39:53.352 --> 39:56.063
Being quite badly behaved at your party.

39:56.146 --> 39:59.983
I'm tired of being so coy and so polite.

40:00.067 --> 40:01.985
What are you talking about?

40:02.069 --> 40:03.403
Let's get married.

40:05.781 --> 40:08.700
I'm serious. Marry me. Be my wife.

40:12.538 --> 40:13.997
Luke. Wha…

40:16.208 --> 40:19.503
-I can't. I mean, you know I can't.
-Why not?

40:20.963 --> 40:23.590
Well, my husband's only been dead
a matter of months.

40:23.674 --> 40:26.134
-It's like--
-Bugger your husband. You didn't love him.

40:26.218 --> 40:27.594
Wh-- And you--

40:27.678 --> 40:28.846
I love you.

40:33.809 --> 40:35.894
I've loved you from the moment I saw you.

40:37.062 --> 40:38.230
Before you knew me?

40:39.314 --> 40:40.649
I liked what I saw.

40:41.692 --> 40:43.485
And you wanted to put your mark on it?

40:46.154 --> 40:49.157
-What happened to carefree Cora?
-Sorry. I--

40:49.241 --> 40:50.492
Just think about it.

40:52.035 --> 40:53.287
We laugh.

40:53.370 --> 40:55.747
We argue.
We're like a married couple already.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.419
Can't friendship be enough?

41:01.295 --> 41:02.796
Crumbs, you mean.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.466
I'm sorry. I'm--

41:09.136 --> 41:10.888
-Once, I might've had more, but--
-Once?

41:10.971 --> 41:12.264
When you invited me to Essex,

41:12.347 --> 41:14.099
-made me the man of your house?
-What?

41:14.183 --> 41:16.685
Why do you think
I threw you that bloody party?

41:19.855 --> 41:22.733
There was I thinking
you wanted to do something for a friend.

41:24.151 --> 41:26.945
What about him? Is he your friend too?

41:29.072 --> 41:30.115
Who?

41:31.033 --> 41:32.659
You do realize he's married?

41:33.285 --> 41:36.121
Although, perhaps not for much longer
given the state of his wife's lungs.

41:36.205 --> 41:37.873
Is that what you're holding out for?

41:39.750 --> 41:42.461
I didn't think
even you were that cold, Cora.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.004
What are you talking about?

41:45.339 --> 41:48.008
TB. I diagnosed her last week.

41:51.136 --> 41:52.221
You're lying.

41:52.304 --> 41:54.264
Ask Spencer if you don't believe me.

41:54.890 --> 41:56.850
Don't worry.
She'll be dead in a few months,

41:56.934 --> 41:58.644
and you can have him all to yourself.

41:58.727 --> 42:00.103
Get away from me.

42:00.187 --> 42:01.813
Cora, wait. I'm sorry.

42:01.897 --> 42:02.981
Get away from me.

42:07.402 --> 42:10.030
-Cora, come back.
-Leave me alone.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.417
-You're drunk.
-You're drunker.

42:27.339 --> 42:28.340
BMA

42:28.423 --> 42:30.676
Run away then, coward.

42:30.759 --> 42:32.469
You're the coward.

42:47.234 --> 42:49.903
If you could kindly
make your way to the stage, sir.

42:51.947 --> 42:53.156
Sod that.

43:16.555 --> 43:20.475
You idiot. You bloody idiot. Idiot!

43:27.858 --> 43:30.652
-What's happened?
-Luke proposed.

43:30.736 --> 43:31.945
-What?
-I know.

43:33.447 --> 43:34.489
You idiot.

43:35.866 --> 43:38.452
-He's the idiot.
-No, Cora. Come on.

43:38.535 --> 43:39.703
No, you weren't there.

43:39.786 --> 43:42.873
One minute we were joking around
and the next, he proposed.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.333
He's in love with you.

43:47.961 --> 43:50.756
Do you have any idea
how painful it is to love you?

43:52.799 --> 43:55.219
I didn't realize.

43:55.302 --> 43:57.387
-No, you never do.
-Martha, wha--

43:57.471 --> 43:59.097
-What do you want, Cora?
-Want?

43:59.181 --> 44:02.476
Yes. Because the longer you just
blunder about not knowing,

44:02.559 --> 44:05.062
-the more people are gonna get hurt.
-It's just--

44:05.145 --> 44:07.231
-I've been trapped for so long--
-Oh, yes.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.900
Go on, blame Michael again.

44:11.068 --> 44:13.946
You're right. I am wasted here.

44:37.219 --> 44:39.680
LONDON & METROPOLITAN RAILWAYS

44:49.565 --> 44:50.566
Money.

44:54.403 --> 44:55.571
Wallet!

44:57.823 --> 44:58.824
No.

44:59.408 --> 45:00.409
Come on.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.301
Give it.

45:28.437 --> 45:30.439
Not my hand. Please.

46:01.261 --> 46:02.471
Father.

46:03.972 --> 46:05.182
Hear my prayer.

46:09.311 --> 46:12.564
I renounce my sins.

46:14.233 --> 46:15.817
I renounce evil.

46:20.197 --> 46:21.532
Bring her back to me.

47:41.403 --> 47:43.405
