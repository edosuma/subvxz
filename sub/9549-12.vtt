<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:04.312 --> 02:07.145
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:08.782 --> 02:11.183
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:11.252 --> 02:12.276
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:12.353 --> 02:14.981
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

02:15.056 --> 02:17.320
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:18.926 --> 02:21.725
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

02:22.230 --> 02:24.596
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

02:24.666 --> 02:25.724
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:25.801 --> 02:28.929
<i>It's amazing</i>

02:29.004 --> 02:30.562
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

02:30.639 --> 02:32.266
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

02:32.374 --> 02:35.502
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

02:35.577 --> 02:36.908
<i>You better pay attention</i>

02:36.979 --> 02:39.813
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

02:39.882 --> 02:43.147
<i>might just kill you</i>

02:43.586 --> 02:45.781
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

02:45.855 --> 02:47.652
<i>But I don't think so</i>

02:47.724 --> 02:50.386
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

02:50.460 --> 02:52.587
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:35.001 --> 03:37.492
Sorry we're late.
Have you been waiting long?

03:38.872 --> 03:40.237
Eleven years.

03:46.346 --> 03:47.404
Are you all right?

03:47.480 --> 03:49.642
Yes, sir.
I'm just smiling.

03:49.717 --> 03:53.517
Adrian, I just want to say that we
really appreciate the work you've done

03:53.587 --> 03:56.249
unofficially as a consultant
over the last eight years.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.756
We've been reading
your case file

03:57.825 --> 03:59.952
and talking
with your colleagues.

04:00.027 --> 04:02.120
It's a very
impressive record.

04:02.196 --> 04:05.256
I worked on
the Raincoat Strangler case.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.530
We worked that case for
nine months without a lead.

04:08.603 --> 04:09.968
I still don't know
how you did it.

04:10.038 --> 04:11.903
I got lucky.

04:12.007 --> 04:14.840
Actually, it was more
than just luck.

04:14.910 --> 04:16.969
I talked
to the suspect,

04:17.045 --> 04:21.914
and I noticed there were a
few discrepancies in his alibi.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.575
It was quite impressive.

04:23.652 --> 04:26.349
It was dazzling,
actually.

04:26.823 --> 04:30.088
Impressive, dazzling.
I'll take either one.

04:30.159 --> 04:33.151
I see you're still
working with Neven Bell.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.424
I've known Neven for years.
He's a good man.

04:35.498 --> 04:37.489
And a good psy...
Doctor.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.631
We've made some
real progress.

04:40.703 --> 04:41.795
So I see.

04:41.871 --> 04:43.669
Tell him
I said hello.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.833
Can... Can I use
your phone?

04:45.909 --> 04:48.434
Oh, you don't have to say hello now.

04:48.512 --> 04:50.002
The next time
you see him.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.274
Ah! Gotcha.
Yeah.

05:03.828 --> 05:05.489
It's fun to laugh.

05:06.564 --> 05:09.294
Mr. Monk, I also appreciate the
work you've been doing for the city,

05:09.367 --> 05:10.561
as well as the progress
you've made.

05:10.635 --> 05:14.332
I have to say I'm
very encouraged. However...

05:14.405 --> 05:15.633
However.

05:15.707 --> 05:18.676
...handing you a gun and a
badge is a big responsibility.

05:18.743 --> 05:20.541
It's probably the most
important decision

05:20.613 --> 05:22.171
this panel
will ever make,

05:22.248 --> 05:24.216
and it wouldn't be fair
to you or the city

05:24.283 --> 05:26.251
to put you on the
street prematurely.

05:26.318 --> 05:28.843
And, speaking personally,
I'm just not sure.

05:28.921 --> 05:30.479
I'm not convinced
you have the judgment,

05:30.556 --> 05:33.286
I'm not convinced
you have the temperament.

05:33.359 --> 05:35.020
Thank you for coming in.

05:35.094 --> 05:37.495
We'll have an answer
by next week.

05:39.966 --> 05:43.333
I mean, it was going so well.
The first two loved me.

05:43.403 --> 05:46.702
I could tell. We were all
laughing, for some reason.

05:46.773 --> 05:49.537
But the third guy,
this Captain Willis,

05:49.609 --> 05:52.009
Frank Willis,
he just hated me.

05:52.078 --> 05:54.546
Well, two out of three, at
least you're getting closer.

05:54.614 --> 05:56.048
Mr. Monk, I just don't think

05:56.117 --> 05:57.914
you have the judgment
or the temperament.

05:57.985 --> 06:00.146
That's how he talks?
Yes, exactly.

06:00.221 --> 06:02.155
Well, it's just a
preliminary hearing, right?

06:02.223 --> 06:04.157
They'll make the final
recommendation next week.

06:04.225 --> 06:05.249
Maybe he'll
change his mind.

06:05.326 --> 06:07.692
You know that Hank Henderson
shot his partner?

06:07.762 --> 06:09.992
Natalie, he shot
his own partner,

06:10.064 --> 06:11.998
and he was reinstated
a month later.

06:12.066 --> 06:14.058
Well, Hank Henderson
plays the game, Mr. Monk.

06:14.136 --> 06:16.468
He plays golf with the police
commissioner's brother.

06:16.538 --> 06:19.006
You got to get out there,
network, kiss some butts.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.268
Sounds so unsanitary.

06:20.342 --> 06:22.037
You know what I mean.
Schmooze.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.771
You have a week
to change his mind.

06:23.845 --> 06:26.177
Hey, there you are.
How'd it go?

06:26.248 --> 06:28.011
Good. It's two to one
in our favor.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.210
Well, that's not bad.
You're getting closer.

06:30.285 --> 06:32.049
Yeah, to
retirement age.

06:32.121 --> 06:34.749
Well, at the moment
we have bigger problems.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.724
Driver's in the hospital,
the guard is dead.

06:36.793 --> 06:38.624
Went down around 10:30.

06:38.695 --> 06:40.822
Very professional,
very well-planned.

06:40.897 --> 06:42.330
Until it wasn't.

06:42.398 --> 06:44.059
Bad guys parked here.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.533
The armored car was about
an hour behind schedule,

06:46.603 --> 06:48.628
so they must've waited
here for some time.

06:48.705 --> 06:51.402
Two guys, they got out,
ski masks,

06:51.475 --> 06:55.571
both with rifles, bang the
driver, bang-bang the guard,

06:55.646 --> 06:57.773
then make off
with 900 grand.

07:00.217 --> 07:02.412
So what do you think?
I can't believe

07:02.486 --> 07:04.579
Henderson got reinstated.

07:04.655 --> 07:05.747
He shot his own partner.

07:05.823 --> 07:06.881
Any fingerprints?

07:06.958 --> 07:09.483
No, nothing. The cab
was clean, the doors.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.529
They were probably
wearing gloves.

07:11.596 --> 07:13.063
Open the meter.

07:13.164 --> 07:14.188
Pardon me?

07:14.265 --> 07:17.029
Well, you said the armored
car was running late,

07:17.102 --> 07:19.627
right, so if they didn't want
to draw attention to themselves

07:19.704 --> 07:21.831
they were probably
feeding the meter.

07:21.906 --> 07:24.033
Fingerprints
on the coin.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.510
Hey, get the tech
guys over here.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.377
Have them open this meter
and dust every coin they find.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.712
You got it.
Thank you.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.684
I'm not a schmoozer.
That's the problem.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.449
I don't play golf. How do
you people schmooze, anyway?

07:36.522 --> 07:38.615
Is it "schmooze"
or "smooze"?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.318
Sorry I'm late.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.291
Uh, don't tell me.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.465
All right, tell me.
It's an outreach program.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.727
The department's
sponsoring it.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.701
It's called
Buddies in Blue.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.795
Uh-huh. You know, kids from the city

07:51.872 --> 07:53.499
spending time with cops.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.473
I'm taking four kids
camping this weekend.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.942
It's gonna be so much fun.
Everybody's gonna get a badge.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.706
Yeah. Almost everybody.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.942
Oh, hey, do you want to come?
I could use the help.

08:02.016 --> 08:03.278
Uh, no.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.043
Do you have plans?

08:05.119 --> 08:06.552
No.

08:06.621 --> 08:08.612
You're not
feeling well?

08:09.657 --> 08:10.988
No.

08:11.059 --> 08:13.084
Well, I hope
you feel better.

08:13.161 --> 08:15.061
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow morning.

08:15.129 --> 08:17.359
Why are you wearing that
now? To get acclimated.

08:17.432 --> 08:20.163
You know, it's like swinging
two bats in the on-deck circle.

08:20.235 --> 08:21.862
Women, they just
don't get it.

08:21.937 --> 08:23.666
Take it off, Randy.

08:23.739 --> 08:25.366
Yes, sir.

08:25.441 --> 08:26.465
What is that?
What do you got?

08:26.542 --> 08:27.736
Peanut shell?

08:27.810 --> 08:30.745
These shells
were twisted apart.

08:30.813 --> 08:33.976
Most people just split
them down the middle, right?

08:34.049 --> 08:35.414
That's how I eat it.
Yeah, me, too.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.715
I'm allergic,
so I don't eat them.

08:37.787 --> 08:38.811
Good work, Detective.

08:38.888 --> 08:41.515
Yeah. Tell that
to Captain Willis.

08:41.591 --> 08:42.649
Frank Willis?

08:42.726 --> 08:45.286
Oh, he's the one
voting against Mr. Monk.

08:45.361 --> 08:47.556
Yeah, I know Frank.
That's Brian's dad.

08:47.630 --> 08:50.064
Who's Brian? Brian, he's
one of my Buddies in Blue.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.624
I'm going camping with him
this weekend.

08:53.803 --> 08:55.066
Really?

08:59.343 --> 09:00.605
Really.

09:04.682 --> 09:06.377
I'll come with you.

09:06.450 --> 09:07.508
Really?

09:07.585 --> 09:08.745
Well, you said
you needed some help.

09:08.819 --> 09:11.549
Great. No, Mr. Monk, it's camping.

09:11.622 --> 09:14.217
Yeah, in the woods. Yeah,
I know what camping is.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.725
I don't think you do.

09:15.794 --> 09:19.127
What? You said I should play
the game, that's what I'm doing.

09:19.197 --> 09:23.133
No, no, I meant more like an
indoor game like gin rummy or...

09:23.201 --> 09:25.726
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm going camping

09:25.804 --> 09:27.032
with little
Brian Willis,

09:27.105 --> 09:31.202
camping and schmoozing
all weekend long.

09:31.277 --> 09:33.745
Oh, yeah. And then he's gonna come home

09:33.813 --> 09:36.509
with a lot of stories
about Adrian Monk.

09:38.484 --> 09:40.213
I'm sure he will.

09:50.063 --> 09:53.055
Okay, Will Dellman.

09:54.001 --> 09:55.628
Hey, Will.
Here.

09:56.603 --> 09:57.763
I call shotgun.

09:57.838 --> 09:59.738
Whoa, hang on,
nobody rides shotgun.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.071
Everybody rides in the back.
Let me get that.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.576
Oh, cool van.
I call window.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.613
Whoa, what's
this thingy?

10:07.315 --> 10:09.180
Can I see your gun?
Whoa! Uh, no, no.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.275
Oh, hop
in the back, there.

10:11.352 --> 10:12.683
All right. Good man.

10:12.754 --> 10:14.312
Uh, hey,
Norman Walters.

10:14.389 --> 10:16.016
Yeah. Hi.
Hi.

10:16.090 --> 10:19.685
Oh, sorry, Norman,
no video games.

10:19.794 --> 10:22.194
Well, hang on. If I cross
this lake, I get 20 points.

10:22.263 --> 10:24.322
Well, you know what? We're
gonna see some real lakes.

10:24.399 --> 10:25.924
Hey.
Hop in the van.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.668
Let me get that.

10:29.738 --> 10:31.569
Okay, Nicky Phillips.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.301
Right here.
Oh, hey.

10:33.375 --> 10:36.276
Uh, you... You bringing this plant?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.472
Yeah. So I can replant it.

10:38.547 --> 10:40.742
It belongs in
a deciduous forest,

10:40.816 --> 10:41.942
not on my mom's patio.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.679
Cool. That's
a good idea, Nicky.

10:43.753 --> 10:44.845
Thanks.
Good thinking.

10:44.921 --> 10:47.048
Great. Take good
care of him.

10:49.025 --> 10:51.050
Will, what are you
doing up there?

10:51.127 --> 10:52.321
Why don't you, uh...

10:52.395 --> 10:53.555
Why don't you come on down
and get in the van?

10:53.630 --> 10:54.722
No.
Yeah.

10:54.798 --> 10:56.231
Hey, come and get in the van.

10:56.299 --> 10:58.563
Just get in the van.
No.

10:58.635 --> 11:00.102
Yeah, come and get in the van. No.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.195
Okay.

11:02.874 --> 11:04.068
All right,
all right.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.972
You so slow.

11:06.043 --> 11:08.443
Mom, Dad, can I get
a little help here?

11:10.514 --> 11:14.314
That's where we are, and
that's where you're going.

11:14.385 --> 11:16.216
The middle of nowhere.

11:21.126 --> 11:22.184
Not too late
to back out.

11:22.261 --> 11:25.662
Oh, no. I am doing this.
I am playing the game.

11:25.731 --> 11:27.062
Well, at least
try to have some fun.

11:27.132 --> 11:30.431
Natalie, it's a game. It's
not supposed to be fun.

11:30.836 --> 11:34.397
So here are your wipes.

11:35.307 --> 11:36.968
Extra wipes.

11:37.043 --> 11:38.874
Thank you.

11:38.945 --> 11:40.936
Backup extra wipes.

11:41.014 --> 11:43.312
Some extra backup wipes.

11:43.383 --> 11:44.873
You want me to write
your name in your clothes?

11:44.951 --> 11:46.646
Not necessary.

11:46.719 --> 11:48.653
A, my name's
already in them,

11:48.721 --> 11:51.087
and B, these clothes
aren't coming off.

11:51.157 --> 11:53.591
Even when you sleep?
Oh, I won't be sleeping.

11:53.660 --> 11:56.027
Mr. Monk,
where's your canteen?

11:56.096 --> 11:57.393
I won't be drinking,
either.

11:57.464 --> 12:02.766
Okay, if I drink water, I
make water, you understand?

12:02.836 --> 12:06.067
I don't want to start the
machine, you understand?

12:06.140 --> 12:07.698
Unfortunately, yes,
I do understand.

12:07.775 --> 12:11.176
Oh, my God. There he is.
Let the games begin.

12:14.482 --> 12:18.350
Listen, I got
to say goodbye to...

12:18.420 --> 12:21.321
Brian, your son?
Should I get a name tag?

12:21.389 --> 12:23.789
Oh, sorry, it's work.

12:23.858 --> 12:25.587
It's always work.

12:26.294 --> 12:27.989
All right.

12:28.063 --> 12:30.930
So camping.
This'll be great.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.934
I used to go camping
all the time. I loved it.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.594
Great.
Why don't you go?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.194
Uh, well,
I wish I could.

12:36.272 --> 12:37.637
You know,
when you come back,

12:37.707 --> 12:39.265
we'll do something together,
just you and me.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.537
You mean between
phone calls, right?

12:41.610 --> 12:44.443
Captain Willis. Hey,
I thought that was you.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.708
Mr. Monk.
Are you part of this?

12:46.782 --> 12:48.613
Yes, sir. I'm one of the instructors,

12:48.684 --> 12:50.209
because I love kids.

12:50.287 --> 12:53.484
I forgot to mention that
yesterday, but I love kids,

12:53.557 --> 12:57.288
because they're
the future, aren't they?

12:59.563 --> 13:02.191
So I guess I'll be getting
to know your son here.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.857
I mean, I'm assuming
he's your son,

13:03.934 --> 13:06.801
unless he's your younger
brother. His brother?

13:06.870 --> 13:11.069
I mean, you seem so mature,
and you look so young.

13:11.609 --> 13:12.906
And you're a detective?

13:12.977 --> 13:16.811
Oh! Good
comeback. Good comeback.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.246
Okay, well, that's
enough schmoozing.

13:18.316 --> 13:21.513
Let's... Let's
go camping! Yeah.

13:21.586 --> 13:23.213
Have fun.
Yeah.

13:23.287 --> 13:24.720
Love you.
Whatever.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.689
Your father
is a great man,

13:26.759 --> 13:30.388
you know, you must be very
proud. We're gonna have fun.

13:30.462 --> 13:33.329
Hey, Brian. Here, let me get that.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.200
Okay, guys, here we go.

13:40.806 --> 13:42.330
Woo-hoo!

13:48.225 --> 13:51.388
I just had two cups of coffee,
I could do this all day.

13:51.461 --> 13:53.861
So let's try again.
Where is your boyfriend?

13:53.930 --> 13:56.330
Which one? The one you've been
living with for three years.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.029
Luke Johnston. The one that robbed
that armored car with his brother.

14:00.103 --> 14:01.366
Luke didn't
rob anybody.

14:01.439 --> 14:05.136
Winona, listen to me, this wasn't
just another smash and grab.

14:05.209 --> 14:06.801
A guard got killed.

14:06.878 --> 14:09.938
And we found Luke's
fingerprints near the scene.

14:10.014 --> 14:11.811
Near the scene.
What does that mean?

14:11.883 --> 14:14.408
It means
I want to talk to him.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.476
That's what it means.

14:16.554 --> 14:18.181
Where are they?

14:18.256 --> 14:19.417
No idea.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.118
Sure you do.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.684
I'm not saying
another word.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.390
Luke and Del
are like family.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.456
That guard
had a family.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.762
Winona, I want you to give
Luke and Del a message,

14:34.840 --> 14:37.002
and don't tell me that you can't
because I know that you can.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.534
I want you to tell them that
Leland Stottlemeyer says "Hi,"

14:40.613 --> 14:42.604
and I will see them soon.

15:24.259 --> 15:27.319
Hey, cool, you brought
your transistor radio?

15:27.395 --> 15:28.726
What are
you listening to?

15:28.797 --> 15:30.025
Music.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.625
What kind of music
does your dad like?

15:32.702 --> 15:34.329
Whatever sucks.

15:34.737 --> 15:36.432
Who's your
favorite band?

15:36.506 --> 15:39.304
I like the Various Artists.
You heard of them?

15:39.375 --> 15:41.536
They do all kinds
of soundtracks.

15:41.611 --> 15:43.738
Look, it's not
gonna work.

15:43.813 --> 15:46.077
What? Kissing my butt
to impress my father.

15:46.148 --> 15:48.481
Me? What are you
talking about?

15:48.552 --> 15:50.315
I heard him
talking about you.

15:50.387 --> 15:51.547
You're the cop
that went crazy,

15:51.622 --> 15:53.613
and now you want
your old job back.

15:53.690 --> 15:56.386
Don't deny it. You
can't make him like you.

15:56.460 --> 15:59.054
Believe me,
I've tried.

16:06.738 --> 16:07.966
I'm hungry.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.473
Me, too.
When's lunch?

16:10.542 --> 16:13.033
Well, I'm thinking
we stop at about noon.

16:14.279 --> 16:16.076
What time is it now?

16:16.147 --> 16:18.274
Hmm. That's
a good question.

16:20.752 --> 16:23.152
All right, this is
called a sundial, guys.

16:23.221 --> 16:25.315
There's the sun,
there's the dial,

16:25.391 --> 16:26.483
it's gonna
tell us the time.

16:26.559 --> 16:28.720
Why don't you
just use your watch?

16:28.794 --> 16:30.022
Oh, 'cause
this is more fun.

16:30.095 --> 16:33.553
Come on, the pioneers didn't
use wristwatches or iPods.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.723
All right,
let's see now.

16:35.801 --> 16:37.428
Say it's about...

16:38.070 --> 16:39.264
10:25.

16:40.639 --> 16:42.938
Come on, guys, all right, fine.
If you need a snack you can, uh...

16:43.009 --> 16:44.442
Hey, eat some
of those berries.

16:44.511 --> 16:46.536
Oh, no, no, no,
that's not a good idea.

16:46.613 --> 16:49.480
They're called moonseed
berries. They're extremely toxic.

16:49.549 --> 16:53.110
Why don't we just agree that
everything in the woods is bad for you?

16:53.186 --> 16:55.882
Let's not eat or touch
or smell anything.

16:55.956 --> 16:57.719
All right, come on, guys,
come on. Here we go.

16:57.791 --> 16:59.019
We're sticking
to the plan.

16:59.092 --> 17:02.722
Let's make it over that ridge,
then we can eat, huh?

17:02.797 --> 17:04.263
All right,
this is fun.

17:04.332 --> 17:05.696
If you say so.

17:05.766 --> 17:08.098
Fun, fun, fun.
Fun, fun, fun.

17:08.169 --> 17:10.433
That's what he said, they
found your fingerprints.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.836
Well, that's impossible,
we both had gloves on.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.897
<i>Yeah? Then why are
they talking to me?</i>

17:14.976 --> 17:16.068
I don't know.

17:16.143 --> 17:17.838
What else
did you forget?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.107
Did you get rid
of the guns?

17:19.181 --> 17:20.239
Guns are gone.

17:20.315 --> 17:21.873
Did you dump everything?

17:21.950 --> 17:23.541
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

17:23.618 --> 17:25.587
You just better be sure,
Luke, is all I'm saying,

17:25.654 --> 17:27.383
because they are gonna be
checking everywhere.

17:27.455 --> 17:29.856
Everywhere you've stayed,
everywhere you've been.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.790
<i>You mean the cabin?
Just get back there</i>

17:31.860 --> 17:33.384
and make sure it's clean.

17:33.462 --> 17:38.059
Baby, if you get sent up again,
I don't think I can stand it.

17:38.134 --> 17:39.761
It's gonna be okay,
you understand me?

17:39.836 --> 17:41.531
We're gonna
take care of it.

17:41.604 --> 17:43.435
<i>When I get back,
you and I have to talk.</i>

17:43.506 --> 17:46.168
What about? About how we're
gonna spend all this money.

17:47.343 --> 17:49.004
I'll see you soon.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.407
They picked her up?
Yeah.

17:53.483 --> 17:55.975
They don't know anything, though.
And what they know, they can't prove.

17:56.053 --> 17:57.247
Where we going?

17:57.321 --> 18:00.051
Back to Spider Lake. We
got some cleaning up to do.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.451
Yeah,
this is perfect.

18:06.096 --> 18:07.723
This is perfect.

18:07.798 --> 18:09.857
All right, guys, we're
camping out right here.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.525
Let's set it up.

18:12.236 --> 18:14.137
Whoa. You guys, look.

18:15.273 --> 18:17.070
Look. Bullet shells.

18:17.142 --> 18:18.166
Whoa!
Let me see that.

18:18.243 --> 18:20.609
Oh, looks like someone was
taking a little target practice.

18:20.679 --> 18:23.773
Probably some juvies.
Juvies?

18:23.848 --> 18:25.782
No, you know, they were
probably playing hooky.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.579
Do you play hooky?

18:27.652 --> 18:29.847
I know I did
when I was a kid.

18:29.921 --> 18:31.822
Yeah, I was
a real hood.

18:33.092 --> 18:34.753
I was a hood
in the hood.

18:34.827 --> 18:36.556
Somebody kill me.

18:38.998 --> 18:41.159
You know, like,
"neighborhood," right?

18:54.748 --> 18:56.375
We got company.

19:09.630 --> 19:11.097
I got matches.
Oh, not yet.

19:11.165 --> 19:13.030
No, it's not
quite even.

19:13.101 --> 19:14.796
We're just going to
burn it, not live in it.

19:14.869 --> 19:17.394
Yeah, you'll
thank me later.

19:17.472 --> 19:20.407
Hey, Brian, would you like to help?

19:20.475 --> 19:22.841
Sure.
Here. There you go.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.012
Oh, he got me again.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.210
He really got me. What a
rascal. You got me again.

19:30.285 --> 19:31.445
Guys, guys, guys,
look what I got.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.851
Look, look, look, look... Whoa!

19:32.921 --> 19:36.118
Yeah! Yeah! Okay, good job.
That's a fish. That's a fish.

19:36.191 --> 19:38.022
Where'd you
get that pole?

19:38.093 --> 19:39.492
I made it.
It's easy.

19:39.561 --> 19:41.927
I found some string and
I made a hook and sinker.

19:41.997 --> 19:44.159
Excellent.
Nicky, good job.

19:44.234 --> 19:46.031
Hey, you showed a little
initiative. Thanks. Thank you.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.400
Let's get a picture of
that bad boy. All right.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.839
All right. Okay.

19:52.642 --> 19:55.475
Hang on.
All right. Smile.

19:55.545 --> 19:57.172
Good. Let's get a close-up of the fish.

19:57.247 --> 19:59.215
Okay.
All right.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.376
Hey, can I
try out your gun?

20:03.454 --> 20:07.015
Whoa, whoa, Will, Will, put
that down, put that down.

20:07.091 --> 20:09.116
Will, this is not
a toy, okay?

20:09.193 --> 20:11.753
So, how many bad guys
have you killed?

20:11.829 --> 20:14.730
I don't really want to
talk about that, okay?

20:15.199 --> 20:17.565
Two.
Only two?

20:17.635 --> 20:19.126
He's a cop.

20:21.973 --> 20:24.203
They called him
the Spider Lake maniac,

20:24.276 --> 20:27.177
because all the killings
happened right here

20:27.245 --> 20:29.543
in these woods
about a year ago.

20:30.282 --> 20:33.513
Actually,
it was a year ago...

20:34.519 --> 20:36.180
Tonight.

20:36.254 --> 20:40.885
Now, there's a mental hospital
about 10 miles away from here.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.258
It's called
the Lassen County Clinic.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.058
Everybody thought
it was escape-proof,

20:45.131 --> 20:47.326
but somehow he escaped.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.561
Randy, excuse me.

20:49.635 --> 20:52.570
The Lassen Clinic's
been closed for 20 years.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.267
That's right, uh, yeah.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.309
It must've been another
mental hospital.

20:56.376 --> 20:57.502
Which one?

20:57.578 --> 20:59.375
Uh, I don't know,
I don't remember.

20:59.446 --> 21:02.847
But the point is
he escaped.

21:03.450 --> 21:07.477
Now, on the first night,
he killed two fishermen.

21:07.554 --> 21:09.579
Slit their throats.

21:09.656 --> 21:11.749
But he didn't
need a knife.

21:11.825 --> 21:12.986
Want to know why?

21:13.061 --> 21:15.461
Because he didn't
have a left hand.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.724
Instead,

21:16.798 --> 21:18.663
he had a razor-sharp hook!

21:20.735 --> 21:24.102
Actually, they don't
use hooks anymore.

21:24.172 --> 21:26.606
These days, they have
prosthetic hands.

21:26.674 --> 21:29.268
You know, rubber.
Just like real hands.

21:29.344 --> 21:30.972
Well, he had a hook.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.946
Or a hand.
It was probably a hand.

21:33.015 --> 21:34.607
It was a hook.

21:35.417 --> 21:36.475
Or a hand.

21:36.552 --> 21:39.020
The important thing is,
he was a maniac

21:39.088 --> 21:40.749
and the simplest thing
could set him off.

21:40.823 --> 21:42.381
He was probably bipolar,

21:42.458 --> 21:44.449
which by the way,
they can treat now.

21:44.526 --> 21:46.357
There's this new drug
called Lexapro.

21:46.428 --> 21:47.417
Lexapro is excellent.

21:47.496 --> 21:49.795
Well, the Spider Lake maniac
didn't take his medicine.

21:49.866 --> 21:52.198
I'm sure he took his medicine. It
was probably mandated by the court.

21:53.370 --> 21:54.496
You're scaring
the kids.

21:54.571 --> 21:56.732
They probably started him off on Xanax.

21:56.806 --> 21:59.366
That's what they did with me. Oh, that
reminds me, I have to take my pills.

22:00.677 --> 22:03.339
Wait, wait, wait. What are
you doing? What is that?

22:03.413 --> 22:04.903
This is my backup.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.977
Fine. So thanks
to modern medicine,

22:10.054 --> 22:12.716
the Spider Lake maniac now
lives in a public housing project

22:12.790 --> 22:15.418
with his pet cat
and never bothers anyone.

22:15.493 --> 22:16.517
The end.

22:16.594 --> 22:18.994
Wow. That was pathetic.

22:19.063 --> 22:22.362
It was a great story, Professor Lame-o.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.699
It's 10:00, guys.
Let's just...

22:25.771 --> 22:27.864
Ah, bedtime,
all right?

22:27.940 --> 22:29.999
Let's go, let's
pack up the camp.

22:30.075 --> 22:32.202
Let's grab the food, seal
it, get it off the ground.

22:32.277 --> 22:34.609
We don't want to have to feed
any more animals tonight.

22:36.181 --> 22:37.808
Professor Lame-o?

22:44.457 --> 22:46.220
That ought to do it.

22:46.326 --> 22:49.386
What are they doing? They're
getting their food off the ground.

22:49.462 --> 22:51.430
It keeps the bears away.

22:51.764 --> 22:54.528
All right, guys,
let's hit the hay.

22:58.004 --> 23:01.839
I can't believe this is the same
sky we have in San Francisco.

23:03.143 --> 23:05.338
Man, I could
get used to this.

23:07.381 --> 23:10.282
How about you? Nah. I can
never get used to anything.

23:10.351 --> 23:13.184
Listen, Randy,
I wanted to apologize.

23:13.253 --> 23:15.016
Yeah, yeah,
I get it.

23:15.089 --> 23:18.617
You're just trying to impress
Brian. Schmoozing, right?

23:18.693 --> 23:20.524
How's it going?
Terrible.

23:21.463 --> 23:22.862
You know,
he's a good kid, Monk.

23:22.931 --> 23:24.023
They all are.

23:24.099 --> 23:25.862
I don't know
how you do it.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.492
What's that?
How you take it.

23:28.303 --> 23:33.605
People joke around, tease you,
you never get mad or upset.

23:33.675 --> 23:37.134
Mmm, it used to bother me when
I was coming up in uniform.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.414
I heard people laughing,
telling Randy Disher stories.

23:42.485 --> 23:45.682
And it hurt,
you know. I almost quit.

23:45.755 --> 23:47.188
What happened?

23:47.256 --> 23:50.783
One night I got a call.
A P-300 downtown.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.023
There was a bumper sticker
on one of the cars,

23:54.096 --> 23:56.622
and it said,
"Happiness is a choice. "

23:58.001 --> 24:02.836
I mean, I know it sounds
crazy, but it changed my life.

24:03.473 --> 24:06.067
I mean, I made
a decision right there.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.873
I chose to be happy.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.680
I mean,

24:11.748 --> 24:13.944
I really believe that.

24:14.018 --> 24:16.043
I mean,
you have the power.

24:17.021 --> 24:19.387
You can choose
to be happy.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.516
I guess I should read
more bumper stickers.

24:21.592 --> 24:24.220
Everybody should.

24:24.295 --> 24:27.924
Okay, it's late.
I'm gonna go sack out.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.092
Yeah, good night.
See you in the morning.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.966
Wait a minute.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.267
P-300? Isn't that a fatality?

24:35.007 --> 24:37.237
Yeah, it was
pretty ugly.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.743
The driver hit a
tractor trailer head-on.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.507
He and his wife
were both DOA.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.481
And this was the car
that had the bumper sticker,

24:44.550 --> 24:45.778
"Happiness is a choice"?

24:45.851 --> 24:49.083
Yeah, that's right. Well, actually,
it was on fire when I got there,

24:49.155 --> 24:50.486
so it was hard to read.

24:50.557 --> 24:55.153
And this didn't deter you
or make you think twice?

24:55.228 --> 24:57.321
It was an epiphany,
Monk.

24:57.397 --> 24:59.422
You can't just choose
where you get it.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.468
I mean, it could be from
a guru on a mountaintop,

25:02.535 --> 25:06.495
or it could be from a bumper
sticker on a burning Subaru.

25:08.075 --> 25:11.340
Well, hey, good night.
I'll see you in the morning.

26:03.634 --> 26:05.431
Let's go.

26:42.675 --> 26:45.803
What is it? I can't
see it. I can hear it!

26:55.422 --> 26:56.719
I think we lost it.

26:56.790 --> 26:59.190
I don't think so.
That was a mature grizzly.

26:59.259 --> 27:01.022
They can run up to
30 miles an hour.

27:01.094 --> 27:02.686
Yeah, I read somewhere
that he's probably

27:02.762 --> 27:04.525
more scared of us
than we are of him.

27:04.598 --> 27:07.089
That's not true.
That can't be true.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.135
This is all his fault.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.168
If you see a bear, you're
not supposed to yell!

27:13.374 --> 27:16.241
You're supposed to
talk to it calmly.

27:16.310 --> 27:18.938
Calmly, like this.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.275
Did you guys hear him?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.145
He was screaming
like a little girl.

27:22.216 --> 27:24.946
I wasn't screaming, exactly.

27:25.019 --> 27:28.147
You were screaming
and crying. We all saw you.

27:28.222 --> 27:29.416
You're so pathetic.

27:29.490 --> 27:33.222
I was warning you. I was,
you know, sounding the alarm.

27:33.295 --> 27:35.593
Like...
Like Paul Revere.

27:35.664 --> 27:37.996
More like Paul Revere's
scared little sister.

27:38.066 --> 27:40.933
You joker.
He didn't have a sister.

27:41.003 --> 27:42.368
What do we do now?

27:42.437 --> 27:44.769
Let's just review
the situation.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.900
Okay, we've been running
for a long time.

27:47.976 --> 27:50.138
Mostly in circles.
Yeah, that's true.

27:50.213 --> 27:53.273
Wait, so you mean we're lost?
With no compass? No cell phone?

27:53.349 --> 27:56.113
We need to stay hydrated.
That's the most important thing.

27:56.185 --> 27:57.243
We need water.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.754
Well, we passed the lake
at least twice.

27:59.822 --> 28:01.153
I say we go back
to the lake.

28:01.224 --> 28:03.715
Great idea. Let's die by the lake.

28:13.637 --> 28:15.400
How many is that?

28:15.472 --> 28:16.837
About 30.

28:17.441 --> 28:19.705
We shot off two clips, so
there should be more out there.

28:19.777 --> 28:21.244
I say we bag it.

28:21.312 --> 28:24.008
If we can't find 'em,
they won't, either.

28:27.018 --> 28:29.543
<i>I'm tired of sucking up</i>

28:29.621 --> 28:31.179
Don't answer it!

28:31.256 --> 28:34.953
<i>I'm tired of sucking up
and working for the man</i>

28:35.026 --> 28:38.587
<i>Keeping people down
'cause the lawbook says I can</i>

28:39.264 --> 28:41.494
Hey. Check it out.

28:42.668 --> 28:45.068
This kid's got one of
our shells on his line.

28:50.776 --> 28:53.711
You said five minutes.
That was 20 minutes ago.

28:53.779 --> 28:55.679
I meant eastern time.

28:56.315 --> 28:57.976
Just relax, nature boy.
That's cool. Let me see it.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.449
I can probably
break it.

28:59.518 --> 29:01.214
Whoa, whoa!

29:01.288 --> 29:03.313
Hey, I got one! Pull it in, pull it in!

29:03.390 --> 29:05.221
Oh, what do you got?
Oh, whoa!

29:05.292 --> 29:07.487
Guys, that's a beauty.

29:07.561 --> 29:09.552
Oh, my God.
Grab me that bucket.

29:09.629 --> 29:11.494
It's my first fish!

29:11.565 --> 29:14.363
It's like
my first anything.

29:14.434 --> 29:15.401
How much do you
think it weighs?

29:15.469 --> 29:18.029
A hundred pounds, at least.
It's got to be a record.

29:18.105 --> 29:20.131
I can't wait to show it to your dad.

29:20.208 --> 29:21.573
Are you mental?
This is so awesome.

29:21.642 --> 29:24.008
We're not showing this to
anybody. That's our lunch.

29:24.078 --> 29:25.670
Yeah, he's right.
We can grill it.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.578
This thing's big enough
for lunch and dinner.

29:27.648 --> 29:29.377
No, I caught it.
I'm keeping it.

29:29.450 --> 29:31.111
Hey, Brian, we're all
hungry. I think it's lunch.

29:31.185 --> 29:32.846
I have to say
I'm with Brian on this.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.512
Big surprise.

29:34.589 --> 29:38.424
Okay, Brian caught the fish.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

29:38.494 --> 29:42.760
That's the rule. In fact, when
you're in the woods, it's ten-tenths.

29:42.831 --> 29:45.026
Ten-tenths?
That doesn't sound right.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.863
Yeah, rules don't
have to sound right.

29:46.935 --> 29:48.266
That's another rule.

29:48.337 --> 29:50.305
Shotgun. Will, we're
not even near the van.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.670
No, shotgun
over there.

29:52.741 --> 29:54.436
Whoa.
Whoa, hey.

29:54.510 --> 29:56.809
Are you guys okay?
Hey, uh...

29:56.880 --> 29:59.110
Yeah, yeah. Good
to see somebody.

29:59.182 --> 30:00.945
We were hunting up on that
ridge, we heard some yelling.

30:01.017 --> 30:03.110
A bear tried to eat us.
A real one.

30:03.186 --> 30:04.653
No kidding?
Yeah, hey, look,

30:04.721 --> 30:06.313
we got a little
turned around.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.913
Do you guys know
where the highway is?

30:07.991 --> 30:10.789
Sure. It's right down
that hill. There's a trail.

30:10.860 --> 30:12.726
Yeah, take you two,
maybe three hours.

30:12.797 --> 30:14.697
Oh, thank you. Oh, wow,
guys, you hear that?

30:14.765 --> 30:16.096
We're gonna be home before dinner. Yes.

30:16.167 --> 30:17.361
Yes.

30:17.435 --> 30:19.926
Broke your line.
Yeah.

30:20.004 --> 30:22.598
Fish was just too big,
so we had to cut it.

30:22.673 --> 30:24.140
Hook, line,
and sinker, huh?

30:24.208 --> 30:26.039
Yeah.
Nice trout.

30:26.110 --> 30:29.102
That's a real beauty.
You want to sell it? No.

30:29.180 --> 30:31.581
I'll give you 50 bucks
right now, cash money.

30:31.650 --> 30:34.778
Okay, uh, $500.
Five hundred?

30:34.853 --> 30:37.879
I figure anyone willing to
pay $50 will pay $500, right?

30:37.956 --> 30:39.719
Uh, wait a minute.

30:40.358 --> 30:43.725
You would actually pay
him $50 for the fish?

30:43.795 --> 30:45.854
What do you say, kid?
I'll give you 75 bucks.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.297
Seventy... No. It's not for sale.

30:48.366 --> 30:50.267
Listen.

30:50.336 --> 30:52.930
<i>I'm tired of sucking up</i>

30:54.540 --> 30:56.531
That's me.
Hey, that's...

30:57.710 --> 31:00.440
That's me. That's...
That's my song.

31:00.513 --> 31:04.074
Oh, dude, this is
gonna rock your world.

31:04.150 --> 31:05.549
You ready for this?

31:05.618 --> 31:07.086
I'm Randy Disher.

31:07.154 --> 31:08.348
Who?
Randy Disher.

31:08.422 --> 31:12.290
It's the Randy Disher Project. I'm
your ringtone, man, that's my song.

31:15.295 --> 31:17.058
Go ahead, man.
Answer it.

31:17.464 --> 31:19.591
Not today,
I'm on vacation.

31:20.367 --> 31:21.834
Anyway, we're gonna
take off.

31:21.902 --> 31:23.392
But it was nice
to meet you guys.

31:23.470 --> 31:24.631
Good luck
with your fish.

31:24.706 --> 31:26.105
Yeah, hey, happy hunting.
Thanks for the help.

31:26.174 --> 31:27.436
Yeah, sure thing.

31:27.509 --> 31:30.103
Happy hunting, boys.
Thanks a lot.

31:31.613 --> 31:33.376
Do you think
they made us?

31:33.448 --> 31:36.008
I don't know, but we
need to get that fish.

31:36.084 --> 31:39.076
Randy, you know
anything about fish?

31:40.288 --> 31:42.017
And what is that?

31:42.090 --> 31:43.820
Oh, that's the sinker.

31:43.893 --> 31:45.258
I made it from one
of the shell casings

31:45.327 --> 31:46.624
we found at the campsite.

31:46.695 --> 31:48.856
You said we could take 'em. Yeah.

31:48.931 --> 31:50.899
Right.

31:50.966 --> 31:54.197
Randy, remember the
armored car Friday morning?

31:54.803 --> 31:56.668
I think these
are the guys.

31:56.739 --> 31:59.173
Did you notice the peanut
shell? It was twisted open,

31:59.241 --> 32:00.573
just like at
the crime scene.

32:00.644 --> 32:01.668
Yeah, I noticed.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.940
You should've
taken the $75.

32:04.014 --> 32:06.141
He'll be back.
Don't worry.

32:06.917 --> 32:10.512
I think Brian's right.
They will be back.

32:20.252 --> 32:23.244
All right. You have your gun, right?

32:23.322 --> 32:24.687
No, it's back
at the campsite.

32:24.757 --> 32:26.019
Oh, no.

32:26.759 --> 32:30.354
All right. All right,
guys. All right, listen up.

32:30.429 --> 32:31.453
We're gonna make it
to that highway,

32:31.530 --> 32:34.158
we're gonna double-time
it all the way, okay?

32:34.233 --> 32:35.723
Brian, give us the fish.

32:35.802 --> 32:37.167
No way.
Okay, buddy.

32:37.237 --> 32:39.762
This isn't a game.
Those men are dangerous.

32:39.839 --> 32:42.433
We need to get the hook and the
sinker out of the fish's mouth.

32:42.509 --> 32:45.478
Forget it. I caught it. It's my fish.

32:45.545 --> 32:47.206
Brian, listen.
You said so yourself.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.111
Brian. Brian!
Brian!

32:49.182 --> 32:50.479
Brian!

32:50.550 --> 32:52.017
I'll get him,
just take the others.

32:52.085 --> 32:53.815
Right, we'll meet you
at the highway.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.981
Let's go, guys.
Be careful!

32:58.859 --> 33:00.087
Brian!

33:01.662 --> 33:02.822
Brian!

33:05.866 --> 33:08.423
Brian.

33:10.104 --> 33:11.128
Brian!

33:11.205 --> 33:13.367
Are you okay? You okay?
Okay, give me the fish.

33:13.441 --> 33:15.705
Just give me! Give it to me! No way!

33:16.111 --> 33:17.635
No!
Give me the...

33:17.712 --> 33:19.407
No!
Give it to me!

33:20.816 --> 33:22.249
Give it to me.
No way!

33:22.317 --> 33:23.375
Give it to me.

33:23.451 --> 33:25.646
I want to give it to my dad. No way.

33:43.639 --> 33:45.539
He wants the fish.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.201
Give it to him.

33:49.179 --> 33:50.612
Okay.

33:50.681 --> 33:52.148
Oh, no, wait.

33:54.017 --> 33:57.145
Not yet. Not yet.

34:05.930 --> 34:09.991
I just need the
little sinker thing.

34:10.068 --> 34:12.536
Material evidence
in a homicide.

34:18.743 --> 34:20.266
Well, give it to him.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.071
Here you go.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.674
It's all yours.

34:30.389 --> 34:31.856
Bon appétit.

34:33.993 --> 34:37.156
What are we gonna do?
He doesn't like the fish.

34:39.264 --> 34:42.030
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He's gonna kill us!

34:44.170 --> 34:46.070
Do something.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.871
It's okay.

34:50.677 --> 34:54.043
It's okay.

34:54.114 --> 34:57.242
I'm very calm.

34:57.350 --> 34:59.682
We're very calm.

35:00.922 --> 35:03.686
Look how calm we are.

35:04.158 --> 35:05.648
He likes it.

35:07.428 --> 35:08.793
It's working.

35:08.863 --> 35:11.127
Keep talking,
keep talking.

35:11.198 --> 35:12.597
What do I say?

35:12.667 --> 35:15.727
I don't know.
Tell him a story.

35:20.309 --> 35:21.435
What... What story?

35:21.510 --> 35:23.842
It doesn't matter!
He's a bear!

35:24.646 --> 35:28.742
Okay. You're probably
wondering what we're doing here.

35:31.153 --> 35:32.984
Here's what happened.

35:34.856 --> 35:38.759
See, an armored car was robbed,
and the guard was killed,

35:38.828 --> 35:40.819
<i>and the police recovered</i>

35:40.897 --> 35:43.593
<i>some shell casings
from the crime scene.</i>

35:43.666 --> 35:45.657
<i>And if they could
match them</i>

35:45.735 --> 35:49.535
to the casings found
in that clearing,

35:49.605 --> 35:51.835
they'd have
an airtight case.

35:54.011 --> 35:55.706
Exactly.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.646
And those two men, they weren't
hunters, they were killers.

35:59.917 --> 36:04.149
<i>They must've been
target practicing up here,</i>

36:04.221 --> 36:05.711
<i>and someone must
have spotted them.</i>

36:05.789 --> 36:07.723
<i>Maybe a park ranger.</i>

36:07.791 --> 36:09.884
That's why
they came back,

36:09.960 --> 36:12.191
because they knew
that those shell casings

36:12.263 --> 36:15.721
could tie them
to the crime scene.

36:28.246 --> 36:30.374
I guess
it got bored.

36:32.218 --> 36:33.378
Nice work.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.079
It's what I do.

36:40.292 --> 36:41.554
Let's go.

36:48.301 --> 36:50.064
Right here.

36:51.671 --> 36:54.504
All right, listen. I want
you guys to stay here.

36:54.574 --> 36:56.633
Nobody moves until I get back, okay?

36:56.710 --> 36:57.870
Okay.
All right.

36:57.944 --> 36:59.741
It's gonna be okay.

37:15.129 --> 37:17.120
There they
are. Let's go.

37:33.482 --> 37:34.949
Drop it now!

37:35.417 --> 37:37.510
Down. Down on your knees.

37:37.586 --> 37:39.110
Down! Get down!

37:50.967 --> 37:52.935
Good job.
Both of you.

37:53.436 --> 37:56.200
I just spoke to the DA.
You made his day.

37:58.575 --> 37:59.941
Mr. Monk, what happened
to your hand?

38:00.010 --> 38:01.409
It was in a fish.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.606
Natalie, in a fish.

38:05.749 --> 38:07.649
Mojo Wire.
Excuse me?

38:07.718 --> 38:11.154
Remember? You asked me my
favorite band. Mojo Wire.

38:11.522 --> 38:12.682
That's their name.

38:12.756 --> 38:14.383
You're welcome.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.931
I didn't hear him
say thank you.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.194
I did.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.336
Dad, I caught a fish.

38:25.403 --> 38:26.597
Wow!

38:27.405 --> 38:29.270
I caught this fish...

38:29.341 --> 38:31.571
You think it'll help?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.002
We'll find out.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.279
It was Mr. Monk. He
helped me catch the fish,

38:38.351 --> 38:40.012
and he saved me
from the bear.

38:48.861 --> 38:50.886
Well, let's get started.

38:51.564 --> 38:53.054
I'll go first.

38:54.601 --> 38:57.593
Last weekend,
this man, Adrian Monk,

38:57.671 --> 38:59.263
saved my son's life.

38:59.339 --> 39:00.636
Actually, he did
more than that.

39:00.707 --> 39:03.733
He challenged my son
and stood up to him

39:03.810 --> 39:05.801
in a way that I was
never able to do.

39:05.879 --> 39:07.904
I've had a change of heart.

39:09.049 --> 39:11.381
I'm going to approve
this recommendation

39:11.451 --> 39:13.647
and support
his reinstatement.

39:15.590 --> 39:16.784
So...

39:17.592 --> 39:19.184
So that's a yes?

39:21.930 --> 39:23.261
Thank you.

39:23.731 --> 39:25.255
Thank you, sir.

39:27.101 --> 39:28.534
I won't let you down.

39:28.603 --> 39:30.435
I'm in!
I can't believe it!

39:30.506 --> 39:32.337
Uh, excuse me, Detective Monk. Yeah.

39:32.408 --> 39:35.275
As you know, this vote
has to be unanimous.

39:35.344 --> 39:36.572
I've been reviewing
your record,

39:36.645 --> 39:40.479
and I'm afraid that I still
have some serious reservations.

39:40.549 --> 39:43.177
I can't recommend your
reinstatement at this time.

39:43.252 --> 39:44.378
Thank you.

39:44.453 --> 39:46.580
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.

39:46.655 --> 39:47.781
Did you hear
what I said?

39:47.857 --> 39:50.121
Detective Monk, I'm sorry,

39:50.193 --> 39:52.491
but I won't be
recommending you, either.

39:52.562 --> 39:54.052
I have to say no.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.963
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

39:57.767 --> 39:59.496
You won't be sorry.

40:00.070 --> 40:01.662
So how's it going?

40:01.738 --> 40:02.932
Thumbs down,
two to one.

40:04.608 --> 40:06.839
Poor thing.
How's he taking it?

40:06.978 --> 40:08.741
Surprisingly well.

40:18.522 --> 40:20.080
Hey, man.
We were listening.

40:20.157 --> 40:21.715
So you know.

40:21.792 --> 40:23.316
Isn't it great?

40:23.661 --> 40:24.924
I'm back.

40:25.697 --> 40:29.064
Leland, I'm back.

40:31.103 --> 40:32.730
Wait, Mr. Monk.

40:33.805 --> 40:36.205
Do you understand what
just happened in there?

40:36.275 --> 40:39.244
What are you talking about?
Of course I do. Come on.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.040
Let's go celebrate.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.417
Happiness is a choice.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.579
We have
to tell him.

40:49.255 --> 40:50.779
Yeah, after lunch.

40:50.857 --> 40:52.688
I'm back, baby!
