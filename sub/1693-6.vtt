==SPREAD THE WORD==

03:32.312 --> 03:33.756
Pick up some lemons

03:33.790 --> 03:37.061
<i>on your way home from work,
would you?</i>

03:38.778 --> 03:41.569
<i>I gotta eat lemons.</i>

03:59.947 --> 04:01.196
Hear what I said?

04:01.409 --> 04:03.509
You want lemons.

04:04.753 --> 04:08.079
I can't get comfortable.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.996
Agent Clarkson
is in a hospital bed

04:10.021 --> 04:14.191
with third-degree burns
over most of his body.

04:14.226 --> 04:18.726
I would venture to say he
can't get comfortable either.

04:18.829 --> 04:20.579
I'm sorry, daddy.

04:20.690 --> 04:24.306
It's just that

04:24.340 --> 04:27.928
I want to be
done with this.

04:32.201 --> 04:34.686
I will pick up lemons.

04:46.515 --> 04:49.728
All human beings sin.

04:49.762 --> 04:54.049
<i>We try and we try,
but still we make mistakes.</i>

04:54.175 --> 04:58.473
So how can we avoid
the fires of hell

04:58.507 --> 05:00.788
if we can't
stop sinning?

05:03.482 --> 05:05.094
We've been over this, dear.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.340
Say sorry?

05:07.374 --> 05:10.429
What else?
Before that.

05:16.589 --> 05:18.240
You have to confess
your sins.

05:18.242 --> 05:19.624
Then you say you're sorry.

05:19.766 --> 05:22.260
He knows.

05:22.294 --> 05:24.081
When you misbehave, Teddy,

05:24.102 --> 05:27.157
when you sass your parents
or laugh in church,

05:27.290 --> 05:29.561
you're like the cruel Jews
and evil soldiers

05:29.595 --> 05:31.910
who taunted Jesus
when he was on the cross.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.894
<i>Now, Jesus never complains,
of course.</i>

05:33.928 --> 05:36.635
<i>He can take it.
But Jesus's father...</i>

05:36.857 --> 05:38.669
You know who that is, Teddy?

05:38.671 --> 05:41.774
- God.
- Very good.

05:41.779 --> 05:43.473
He doesn't like it
when we sin.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.922
It makes him very angry.
And when God is angry,

05:45.948 --> 05:47.702
where does he think
about sending us?

05:47.731 --> 05:49.308
We need to wrap
this up, ed.

05:49.373 --> 05:51.945
This is our last meeting
before his first confession.

05:51.979 --> 05:53.779
It's important to set
a good example.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.944
I'm pretty confident
that between the three of us

05:55.978 --> 05:58.925
we can save his soul.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.109
I'll be in the car.

06:02.799 --> 06:05.336
You are now seven years old.

06:05.371 --> 06:07.987
Thus you have attained
the age of reason,

06:07.989 --> 06:10.461
meaning you know the difference
between right and wrong.

06:10.555 --> 06:13.699
<i>After age seven, God doesn't
just watch over us, does he?</i>

06:13.942 --> 06:15.645
<i>What else does he do?</i>

06:16.851 --> 06:19.621
He judges us?

06:21.986 --> 06:24.280
He judges us.

06:30.009 --> 06:32.467
Stop that, Teddy.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.482
Make sure he's prepared
to list his sins

06:34.512 --> 06:37.028
honestly and thoroughly
tomorrow.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.624
You also,
for your own confession.

06:39.813 --> 06:42.634
I must confess as well?

06:42.668 --> 06:46.871
It really is about
setting an example.

06:53.147 --> 06:56.231
May it please the court,
my name is Charles Thorogood,

06:56.285 --> 06:58.651
representing the people
of the united states.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.012
We're here today,
seeking a transfer

07:01.046 --> 07:03.435
of the election-rigging case
against Enoch Thompson...

07:03.437 --> 07:05.041
What are you wearing there?

07:05.043 --> 07:08.518
<i>- Your honor?
- On your feet.</i>

07:12.472 --> 07:15.579
Shoes, your honor.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.083
Green.

07:18.107 --> 07:20.792
Very demonstrative.

07:22.649 --> 07:25.422
Your honor, I'm here today
seeking a transfer

07:25.424 --> 07:28.165
of the election-rigging case
against Enoch Thompson

07:28.200 --> 07:30.985
from state
to federal court.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.031
As it has been brought
to our attention...

07:33.065 --> 07:34.918
By the press in fact,

07:34.920 --> 07:36.733
as opposed to
the state's attorney

07:36.763 --> 07:38.657
as would
have been proper...

07:38.659 --> 07:40.373
The charges against Mr. Thompson

07:40.374 --> 07:42.791
now include the
transportation of women

07:42.792 --> 07:45.186
across state lines
for immoral purpose,

07:45.221 --> 07:48.053
in violation of the White
Slave Traffic Act, Section 2,

07:48.069 --> 07:49.489
also known
as the Mann Act.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.220
I know what it is,
counselor.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.078
What I don't know is how it
relates to election rigging.

07:54.110 --> 07:57.629
- If I may, your honor...
- You may not.

07:57.688 --> 07:59.769
The defendant Mr. Thompson

07:59.771 --> 08:01.570
<i>is accused of paying
these women</i>

08:01.572 --> 08:03.168
to coerce
potential voters

08:03.202 --> 08:06.113
by employing
their feminine wiles.

08:06.115 --> 08:08.595
- Sex, intercourse.
- Yes.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.819
And given the high-profile
nature of this case,

08:10.873 --> 08:12.918
we think it appropriate
that the federal government

08:13.168 --> 08:16.928
take over what the good state
of New Jersey has begun.

08:16.962 --> 08:19.579
That way we may
prosecute Mr. Thompson

08:19.672 --> 08:22.706
to the full extent
of the law.

08:30.314 --> 08:33.808
I'm inclined to agree
with you, Mr. Thorogood.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.471
Thank you, your honor.

09:03.015 --> 09:05.282
You got Daniel in there?

09:05.367 --> 09:08.401
- Pardon?
- The lion's den.

09:08.403 --> 09:10.783
My boys love that one.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.112
It's for my nephew.

09:12.146 --> 09:13.628
He's making
his first confession.

09:13.662 --> 09:17.619
Oh. Very nice.
Very nice.

09:21.205 --> 09:24.428
- You a churchgoing man?
- Oh, I never miss a week.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.718
Shiloh baptist
over on arctic.

09:29.084 --> 09:31.893
Have a blessed week.

09:37.407 --> 09:40.297
George Remus calling.

09:46.325 --> 09:49.571
George, hearing your name
a lot lately.

09:49.605 --> 09:51.295
<i>Calling to say thanks.</i>

09:51.329 --> 09:54.955
Remus wasn't expecting any favors
coming his way from Atlantic city.

09:54.997 --> 09:58.233
<i>If you're talking about whatever deal
you worked out with Jess Smith,</i>

09:58.249 --> 10:00.475
let's just say
I was helping both of us.

10:00.477 --> 10:01.758
<i>We reached an agreement.</i>

10:01.793 --> 10:03.746
Now Remus can buy
his liquor permits

10:03.748 --> 10:07.119
straight from the source,
as often as he needs to.

10:07.121 --> 10:08.545
Sounds like
you're rolling in it.

10:08.678 --> 10:11.586
<i>More like floating.</i>

10:11.706 --> 10:14.559
<i>Do you know what Remus
is doing right now?</i>

10:14.593 --> 10:16.350
I'm sure I can't imagine.

10:16.464 --> 10:19.537
Getting ready for a dip
in his indoor swimming pool.

10:19.557 --> 10:20.577
Lavish.

10:20.578 --> 10:24.656
<i> Even better than having the
ocean outside your door.</i>

10:24.765 --> 10:26.621
Then when can I expect
a finder's fee?

10:26.623 --> 10:28.916
What for?

10:28.950 --> 10:31.216
<i>The recommendation
to Smith.</i>

10:31.249 --> 10:34.007
Wow...
You haven't changed.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.374
<i>George,</i>

10:35.497 --> 10:38.454
is the irony lost on you
that you operate in Ohio

10:38.456 --> 10:41.830
but didn't know anyone from harding's
administration until I stepped up?

10:42.069 --> 10:44.299
You know what Remus
doesn't like about you?

10:44.333 --> 10:46.921
<i>- The nickel and diming.
- Jesus Christ!</i>

10:46.955 --> 10:48.972
You're still squawking
about the phone charges?

10:48.974 --> 10:52.236
You come to Cincinnati, you're not
handed a bill for the maid service.

10:52.271 --> 10:54.461
Why the fuck would anyone
ever go to Cincinnati?

10:54.495 --> 10:56.982
Remus finds you petty
and resentful.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.871
Well, Remus can
go fuck himself.

11:26.351 --> 11:29.004
"I am indebted
to my father for living,

11:29.038 --> 11:31.762
but to my teacher
for living well."

11:31.764 --> 11:33.558
Alexander the great.

11:33.635 --> 11:36.021
Son of a king.

11:36.023 --> 11:37.492
Like you, dear.

11:37.526 --> 11:41.833
A king who's very proud
of his heir.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.878
And my teacher...

11:43.912 --> 11:45.366
What about him?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.132
Nucky?

11:47.134 --> 11:49.477
He's always
thinking ahead.

11:49.511 --> 11:51.965
This ploy with
the attorney general...

11:52.006 --> 11:54.890
- You sound impressed.
- It's a clever move.

11:54.924 --> 11:56.519
I wouldn't have
thought of it.

11:58.591 --> 12:01.041
I'm sorry, Louis,
but give the man his due.

12:01.075 --> 12:04.234
- No no.
- Easy darling, easy. It's time for your medicine.

12:04.365 --> 12:07.563
- Langston.
- God damn it.

12:12.868 --> 12:15.244
Tough old bird,
that one.

12:16.453 --> 12:19.141
I thought he was
talking about you, ma.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.636
<i>I'm glad you're keeping your
chin up through all this.</i>

12:24.052 --> 12:26.927
I've been through
bigger scrapes.

12:27.097 --> 12:29.405
But you were taking orders
then, not giving them.

12:30.925 --> 12:34.714
The business with Jackson parkhurst...
Was that necessary?

12:36.090 --> 12:38.614
You would have to ask
the men responsible.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.956
I'd be lying if I said
that many tears were shed,

12:43.990 --> 12:46.160
but you've alienated
some powerful allies.

12:46.282 --> 12:48.848
We don't care for what
you're implying, leander.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.447
I'd like to talk
to your son...

12:53.483 --> 12:55.059
Privately.

12:55.093 --> 12:57.311
It's all right, mom.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.154
I know you'll tell me
everything.

13:14.653 --> 13:17.151
That's just
something she does.

13:17.153 --> 13:19.488
I can't fault you
for boldness,

13:19.522 --> 13:22.205
but not every insult
requires a response.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.181
How would you
have handled it?

13:35.177 --> 13:37.140
Your father,
when we first met...

13:37.233 --> 13:40.969
This was a long time ago...
He had many virtues,

13:41.003 --> 13:43.245
but prudence
was not one of them.

13:43.279 --> 13:45.703
It caused him
some difficulty.

13:45.822 --> 13:47.869
Nucky was different.

13:47.921 --> 13:50.297
From the start, he was thinking
about something bigger...

13:50.328 --> 13:53.143
A machine that made
everyone pay.

13:53.177 --> 13:55.752
And what he accomplished
was impressive.

13:55.786 --> 13:57.950
I don't see you
at his fundraisers.

13:57.952 --> 14:00.928
That doesn't stop me
from admiring his skill.

14:01.154 --> 14:04.426
What's so hard about putting
the squeeze on somebody?

14:06.181 --> 14:08.586
Are you finding it easy?

14:09.799 --> 14:13.733
<i>No? Then don't be
so quick to judge.</i>

14:13.902 --> 14:15.657
I've started something,
Mr. Whitlock.

14:15.691 --> 14:18.076
I'm going to see it
through no matter what.

14:18.110 --> 14:21.603
I'd rather hear
that you wanted to win.

14:27.691 --> 14:29.977
Isn't that
what I just said?

15:07.087 --> 15:09.121
Oh.

15:18.958 --> 15:22.052
<i>Only my third time
before a judge.</i>

15:22.094 --> 15:23.516
<i>You believe that?</i>

15:23.568 --> 15:25.799
And it was nifty,
I tell you,

15:25.807 --> 15:27.647
just like my old man
said it'd be.

15:27.828 --> 15:29.494
Oh, your dad's a lawyer?

15:29.527 --> 15:31.993
Of course he's a lawyer.

15:32.027 --> 15:35.114
- Don't you know my old man?
- Can't say as I do.

15:35.148 --> 15:36.919
He must know
my old man, huh?

15:36.946 --> 15:39.034
Connecting you now, sir.

15:39.086 --> 15:40.618
<i>- Nucky!
- Harry!</i>

15:40.652 --> 15:42.459
<i>You sound happy.
Are you happy?</i>

15:42.493 --> 15:44.924
<i>Life is grand.
I'm a federal defendant.</i>

15:44.972 --> 15:46.526
So now you owe me one.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.212
Actually, now we're even.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.526
Or we will be once skippy
here tanks the case.

15:50.559 --> 15:52.707
<i>- Chip.
- Glad to have helped, nuck.</i>

15:52.742 --> 15:56.127
- Tell him I said thanks.
- Jess says thanks for the intro to Remus.

15:56.161 --> 15:57.696
<i>That's a big fish
right there.</i>

15:57.731 --> 15:59.410
Well, watch he doesn't
scuttle the ship.

15:59.412 --> 16:02.424
Not with me at the helm.

16:02.465 --> 16:04.728
Take care of the boy, nuck.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.366
Me and his pop
go way back.

16:06.412 --> 16:09.643
<i>- So I gather.
- Congratulations, Nucky.</i>

16:11.996 --> 16:13.518
Your boss says
to take care of you.

16:13.635 --> 16:15.679
- What's your pleasure, counselor?
- What do you think?

16:15.681 --> 16:18.180
I'm a red-blooded
American boy.

16:18.182 --> 16:20.136
Order him up
some apple pie.

16:20.171 --> 16:22.804
Cherry's more my style.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.825
A LA mode, if you
catch my meaning.

16:25.827 --> 16:28.692
I don't, actually,
but Mr. Kessler

16:28.726 --> 16:30.442
will set you up
in a suite.

16:38.550 --> 16:41.026
<i>Ja, I understand.
You want schlampen.</i>

16:41.060 --> 16:44.029
Yeah, if schlampen
means a nice redhead...

16:50.252 --> 16:53.007
Oh, where do you want
this sack of potatoes, miss?

16:53.044 --> 16:56.207
Oh, anywhere will be fine.

16:56.241 --> 16:58.457
There you go.

16:58.513 --> 17:01.102
Now run along now
before she cooks you up.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.682
Is there anything else
I can help you with, ma'am?

17:05.738 --> 17:08.085
That will be all.
Thank you.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.337
You're looking
fetching today.

17:11.371 --> 17:14.829
Why thank you,
Mr. Sleater.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.381
Right, duty calls.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.180
Katy, might I have
a word, please?

17:33.224 --> 17:35.130
Of course, ma'am.

17:41.128 --> 17:45.381
I can't help but notice
you and Mr. Sleater.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.056
Yes, ma'am?

17:48.058 --> 17:51.285
There seems to be
quite an attraction.

17:51.319 --> 17:54.801
He is very handsome.

17:54.835 --> 17:57.838
But it's more than that,
isn't it?

17:57.872 --> 18:00.912
I don't know
what you mean, ma'am.

18:01.004 --> 18:04.723
Don't be coy, Katy.
It doesn't suit you.

18:07.796 --> 18:13.130
Your behavior,
yours and his...

18:13.164 --> 18:16.825
There are children
in this house

18:16.859 --> 18:19.525
as you're well aware.

18:44.396 --> 18:46.391
You can go in now.

19:28.997 --> 19:32.283
Jesus Christ.

19:32.285 --> 19:33.743
I wasn't
exaggerating, sir.

19:33.777 --> 19:37.733
- How is he still alive?
- He loves the lord, sir.

19:39.248 --> 19:42.721
Well, it seems that's a pretty
one-sided relationship.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.440
When you blaspheme
in this room,

19:45.474 --> 19:47.465
you insult agent Clarkson.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.646
<i>Even the doctors,
men of science,</i>

19:49.680 --> 19:53.774
agree that his fate rests
in God's hands, not theirs.

20:02.647 --> 20:04.038
O lord,

20:04.072 --> 20:08.455
<i>one who loves you
is gravely injured.</i>

20:08.489 --> 20:11.319
<i>We beseech you:</i>

20:11.405 --> 20:15.597
Mend his flesh.
Make him whole.

20:15.599 --> 20:19.293
You breathed life
into Lazarus,

20:19.327 --> 20:21.704
touched the leper...

20:29.179 --> 20:32.832
Should I get the doc?

20:32.866 --> 20:37.160
You... you...

20:39.851 --> 20:42.851
I see you.

20:46.884 --> 20:50.637
I know...

20:50.639 --> 20:54.525
I know what you did.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.048
What's he saying?

20:59.729 --> 21:02.877
I'll get the doctor.

21:27.008 --> 21:29.381
Run it down so everyone's
on the same page.

21:29.415 --> 21:31.292
Tomorrow night,
2:00 A.M.

21:31.340 --> 21:34.316
The weather's fair so we'll get
as close to shore as possible.

21:34.318 --> 21:37.762
We got speedboats,
over a dozen.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.433
The whole pickup will take
less than an hour.

21:40.476 --> 21:42.017
And we're safe
from the coast guard?

21:42.057 --> 21:44.104
I don't want a repeat
of last time.

21:44.106 --> 21:46.099
Mr. Gordon has given us
his assurances.

21:46.101 --> 21:49.645
Waxey.
And yes, we're safe.

21:49.707 --> 21:51.220
That's what
you're paying me for.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.595
I was beginning to wonder.

21:52.629 --> 21:54.345
Once they make shore
in Philly,

21:54.396 --> 21:56.132
the goods are loaded
onto trucks by Waxey's men.

21:56.167 --> 21:59.042
Chayem here will supervise,
then his fellas'll get youse

21:59.044 --> 22:01.285
<i>safe to the border
of Atlantic city.</i>

22:01.287 --> 22:02.842
To the border?

22:02.900 --> 22:05.429
For 20% they should be
taking us all the way.

22:05.463 --> 22:07.065
Youse are broads now?

22:07.099 --> 22:08.453
We gotta walk you home?

22:08.487 --> 22:10.099
A kiss goodnight
would be nice.

22:10.189 --> 22:12.860
- Sure, with a lead fuckin' pipe.
- Charlie.

22:12.862 --> 22:14.992
No one's gonna
give you no trouble.

22:15.026 --> 22:17.179
They do, they gotta
answer to me.

22:17.259 --> 22:19.204
And I'll be expecting ya'll
round about 5:00.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.111
<i>And make damn sure
you flash them lights</i>

22:21.145 --> 22:23.451
<i>'cause I ain't taking
no more chances.</i>

22:49.534 --> 22:52.627
Hey, kid!

22:52.661 --> 22:55.166
<i>Can you get your mom?</i>

22:57.551 --> 23:02.271
<i>Can you get
your mom, please?</i>

23:07.447 --> 23:10.192
Please!

23:10.226 --> 23:13.593
Please!

23:13.595 --> 23:16.960
Please!

23:29.485 --> 23:32.433
The latest wireless
radio receiver.

23:32.485 --> 23:35.105
Yes, sir.
Come come.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.579
Come on.

23:36.608 --> 23:38.779
Come on. You, sir. Come on over.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.698
You, sir.
How about you, madam?

23:40.732 --> 23:43.237
Wireless.

23:43.258 --> 23:45.381
Look at that.

23:45.415 --> 23:47.881
There's music
everywhere suddenly.

23:49.547 --> 23:51.938
We should get one.

23:51.971 --> 23:54.180
It would be really
nice for Tommy.

23:54.221 --> 23:55.851
We could introduce him
to the classics

23:55.895 --> 23:59.520
without having to spend
a fortune on records.

23:59.556 --> 24:01.186
I also read
that the immigrants

24:01.234 --> 24:03.196
are using it
to learn English.

24:03.232 --> 24:05.279
<i>It was in the newspaper.</i>

24:05.309 --> 24:09.076
They can sit in their own living
rooms and repeat whatever they...

24:20.977 --> 24:23.088
What was that for?

24:24.020 --> 24:26.522
I guess the music
got to me.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.119
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, dear.</i>

24:43.257 --> 24:47.460
Nelson, it's nearly
11:00 P.M.

24:47.634 --> 24:51.345
One of my officers,

24:51.347 --> 24:55.065
agent Clarkson...
You met him...

24:55.180 --> 24:57.445
He's been
very badly hurt.

24:57.447 --> 24:59.840
Oh my.

24:59.979 --> 25:02.360
<i>It... it happened
some time ago.</i>

25:02.474 --> 25:06.034
There was an explosion,
a still.

25:06.036 --> 25:09.039
<i>- I should have been there.
- Nelson, no.</i>

25:09.073 --> 25:12.669
There are things
you don't know, Rose,

25:12.703 --> 25:15.651
about me,
about this job.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.640
<i>- I'm not fit...
- Nelson,</i>

25:17.661 --> 25:21.692
you aren't responsible
for the evils in the world.

25:21.726 --> 25:25.610
<i>You're the one trying
to make it a better place.</i>

25:25.664 --> 25:29.346
<i>Nelson? Nelson!</i>

25:31.102 --> 25:34.202
I want you to know...

25:34.248 --> 25:38.278
It's important
that you know

25:38.324 --> 25:40.890
that everything
I have done

25:40.892 --> 25:43.394
is because I love you.

25:43.527 --> 25:45.688
Nelson,
you're frightening me.

25:45.722 --> 25:48.940
<i>I have sinned, Rose,</i>

25:49.009 --> 25:53.262
and a good and decent man
has burned for those sins.

25:53.264 --> 25:54.136
<i> Listen to me... </i>

25:54.137 --> 25:56.444
It's all right, dear.
I've made my peace.

25:56.512 --> 25:59.304
I'm neither fit for you nor
am I fit to wear this badge.

25:59.342 --> 26:02.641
<i>- Nelson...
- I love you.</i>

27:12.972 --> 27:15.905
Do you not find me
attractive?

27:16.844 --> 27:19.010
What?

27:19.012 --> 27:21.248
Of course I do.

27:22.554 --> 27:24.964
We just made love,
Margaret.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.578
Sometimes it feels like
you're elsewhere.

27:30.820 --> 27:34.216
I'm nowhere else.
I'm right here.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.402
What's on your mind?

27:53.419 --> 27:56.984
I've been told I need
to make a confession.

27:57.018 --> 28:00.117
What? By who?

28:00.227 --> 28:03.004
Father Brennan.

28:03.038 --> 28:06.123
In preparation
for Teddy's communion.

28:06.158 --> 28:10.662
Every shoe salesman thinks
you need a new pair of boots.

28:12.221 --> 28:15.764
He says it's to set
an example.

28:17.506 --> 28:20.092
What do you plan to say?

28:21.907 --> 28:25.086
That's between
me and God, isn't it?

28:25.088 --> 28:27.713
Yes, and father Brennan.

28:27.715 --> 28:31.637
- He's a priest.
- Which means what?

28:31.712 --> 28:34.841
That there is
a sacred trust.

28:34.957 --> 28:38.617
You put a lot more faith
in people than I do.

28:38.619 --> 28:42.767
Faith is the point entirely,
isn't it?

28:44.057 --> 28:47.030
<i>- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.</i>

28:51.173 --> 28:53.315
How catholic are you?

28:54.856 --> 28:56.299
I beg your pardon?

28:56.359 --> 29:00.968
You're not seriously planning on
divulging anything sensitive?

29:01.083 --> 29:04.534
- Like what?
- Like our shared history,

29:04.587 --> 29:08.504
the details of which
we'd both be wise to forget.

29:10.636 --> 29:12.008
If you're feeling guilty,

29:12.216 --> 29:15.264
I suggest you take that up
with a priest yourself.

29:33.491 --> 29:35.681
Hello?

29:37.692 --> 29:39.152
There's a man
on the phone.

29:39.186 --> 29:40.654
He says he's
calling you back.

29:40.867 --> 29:43.580
- Who is it?
- It sounded like "onion."

29:43.614 --> 29:46.157
I don't like onions.

29:52.173 --> 29:53.505
Hello?

29:53.539 --> 29:55.536
Boychik,
you left a message.

29:55.570 --> 29:57.028
<i>Munya!</i>

29:57.060 --> 29:59.693
Hey, hold on a minute.

29:59.695 --> 30:01.219
Go with your mother, pal.

30:01.221 --> 30:02.849
But I've got food
in my mouth.

30:02.883 --> 30:04.927
Take it
in the other room.

30:06.136 --> 30:08.600
Let's go
in the living room.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.828
What the fuck are you
trying to pull, Manny?

30:22.829 --> 30:23.528
<i> Pull?</i>

30:23.562 --> 30:26.181
I'm not the one who screwed you
in a business deal, boychik.

30:26.215 --> 30:29.673
<i>Last night on the boardwalk,
I saw a friend of yours.</i>

30:29.841 --> 30:31.265
Which friend?

30:31.267 --> 30:32.920
You really want
to play this game?

30:32.922 --> 30:35.084
<i>I don't play games,
Mr. Darmody.</i>

30:35.142 --> 30:38.135
There are any number of corpses
that will attest to that.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.764
Now either you can tell me
who you saw,

30:39.766 --> 30:42.100
<i>or quit wasting
my fucking time.</i>

30:42.137 --> 30:44.867
Your friend...
Herman was his name.

30:44.901 --> 30:46.747
<i>I met him at your shop.</i>

30:46.781 --> 30:48.600
He was coming
out of the Ritz

30:48.668 --> 30:51.298
with Waxey Gordon
and Nucky Thompson.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.483
And you're sure about this?

30:54.606 --> 30:57.806
I'm positive.

30:57.834 --> 31:00.756
<i>- Did he see you?
- No.</i>

31:01.951 --> 31:05.168
I'll ask you
one more time, boychik...

31:05.203 --> 31:07.682
You're certain
it was Chayem with Waxey?

31:07.684 --> 31:11.857
The fella
from your shop, yes.

31:11.859 --> 31:14.738
Let me ring you back.

31:24.993 --> 31:26.704
Mrs. Thompson,
good morning.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.992
Good morning.

31:33.027 --> 31:34.612
What happened there?

31:34.787 --> 31:37.158
I spilled
some cornflakes.

31:38.874 --> 31:41.218
Is Katy not here?

31:41.220 --> 31:44.812
She took the children
to the market.

31:44.846 --> 31:48.012
Selling them, are you?

31:48.206 --> 31:50.704
It's Mrs. Schroeder.

31:51.512 --> 31:53.639
Ma'am?

31:53.673 --> 31:55.099
When you came in,

31:55.133 --> 31:56.835
you addressed me
as Mrs. Thompson.

31:56.934 --> 32:00.064
My apologies.
I forgot your situation...

32:02.968 --> 32:06.890
Which is entirely
none of my business.

32:11.382 --> 32:13.048
Katy told me you spoke.

32:15.050 --> 32:19.342
- Did she?
- What happened, ma'am, was completely my fault.

32:19.376 --> 32:22.335
This is your home
and I need to show respect.

32:22.369 --> 32:25.183
You need
to respect Katy.

32:25.217 --> 32:27.715
I do, ma'am.
She's a lovely girl.

32:31.399 --> 32:35.128
Are you in the habit of toying
with women, Mr. Sleater?

32:37.576 --> 32:40.869
Well, I wouldn't
call it a habit.

32:42.234 --> 32:43.944
Let me help you
with that.

32:51.513 --> 32:53.233
Don't we have a girl
for that?

32:53.255 --> 32:56.626
She's out
with the children.

32:56.678 --> 32:58.311
I'm late.

32:58.354 --> 33:00.570
Here, let me.

33:00.598 --> 33:03.601
Always happy to be of service, Mrs.
Schroeder.

34:11.408 --> 34:15.033
Aah!

34:15.034 --> 34:17.085
Ooh.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.695
It's called a fez.

34:19.737 --> 34:22.319
You can ask him
at the dinner.

34:22.353 --> 34:25.846
Senator edge
would like a word.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.103
Listen, bill,
I gotta run.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.676
- Harry Daugherty.
- Walter!

34:34.710 --> 34:37.422
What brings you
to Washington?

34:37.485 --> 34:39.514
Have a minute for the great
state of New Jersey?

34:39.684 --> 34:41.694
Always, senator.

34:41.728 --> 34:44.608
I ran into your old pal
Charlie Forbes.

34:44.610 --> 34:47.357
- Ah, good old Charlie.
- Indeed.

34:47.391 --> 34:48.947
He tells me you have
harding's ear

34:49.063 --> 34:52.013
on this bureau
of veterans affairs.

34:52.014 --> 34:54.406
A worthy endeavor,
wouldn't you say?

34:55.580 --> 34:57.693
Might even benefit
a few veterans.

34:57.833 --> 35:00.698
- How do you mean?
- Oh, come on, Harry.

35:00.732 --> 35:04.628
There are crooks,
then there's Charlie Forbes.

35:05.699 --> 35:07.858
He's a veteran himself,
Walter.

35:07.892 --> 35:09.886
So was Benedict Arnold.

35:09.888 --> 35:11.518
Forgive my prying,
senator,

35:11.539 --> 35:14.628
but since when are you concerned
about veterans' affairs?

35:14.655 --> 35:17.618
Well, it's not me so much
as my constituents,

35:17.652 --> 35:21.083
one of whom is urging me
to launch a subcommittee

35:21.128 --> 35:23.938
to investigate
this matter.

35:24.002 --> 35:25.740
I see.

35:25.774 --> 35:27.173
And this constituent,

35:27.196 --> 35:29.635
does he have any other
matters that concern him?

35:29.665 --> 35:33.276
He does, now that
you mention it.

35:33.278 --> 35:36.118
Nucky Thompson.

35:36.152 --> 35:39.581
He hates
the son of a bitch.

35:39.615 --> 35:43.282
And it has come to his attention
that you have appointed

35:43.284 --> 35:47.846
a less-than-enthusiastic
prosecutor to his case.

35:49.601 --> 35:52.505
And if I appointed one who took
Nucky's case more seriously...

35:52.539 --> 35:55.331
Then I'm sure my interest in how you
and your cronies plan to plunder

35:55.366 --> 36:00.045
the veterans bureau
would wane accordingly.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.349
Hmm.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.848
I didn't want to do this
for a living.

36:10.850 --> 36:14.020
People see the apron,
they make assumptions.

36:14.054 --> 36:17.749
16 years old, I saw
Emma Thomashefsky on stage...

36:17.787 --> 36:20.005
The Arch Street Theater.

36:20.049 --> 36:21.714
Was I in love?

36:21.756 --> 36:23.258
What do you think?

36:23.297 --> 36:25.299
Stage-struck.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.557
Put money on it.

36:27.611 --> 36:29.958
My father,
he wouldn't hear a word.

36:30.134 --> 36:32.028
Regrets?
Who has time?

36:32.067 --> 36:33.608
Here we go.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.732
- You remember Herman.
- Jesus, Manny.

36:35.792 --> 36:37.419
Hey, not in my shop,
boychik.

36:37.453 --> 36:38.847
Try down the road.

36:38.881 --> 36:40.545
You dragged me
up here for this?

36:40.547 --> 36:45.715
I invited you to hear
from the horse's mouth.

36:45.749 --> 36:47.839
Look who's come, Herman...

36:47.873 --> 36:49.932
Another friend
from Atlantic city.

36:51.055 --> 36:54.104
Help me, please.

36:54.106 --> 36:57.521
Herman, what's he going
to do for you?

36:57.694 --> 37:01.306
This is our problem,
yours and mine.

37:01.447 --> 37:05.229
Herman... since he was
in knee-highs I know him,

37:05.263 --> 37:07.689
but then he got
an idea in his head.

37:07.723 --> 37:09.875
Tell him what it was.

37:12.722 --> 37:14.402
Tell him what it was!

37:14.404 --> 37:17.026
Waxey Gordon.

37:17.028 --> 37:19.327
He goes to work
for Waxey Gordon.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.903
<i>And from that pisher
he takes money to spy on me.</i>

37:24.741 --> 37:26.339
<i>A person like that...</i>

37:26.401 --> 37:29.601
Honestly, I don't
understand how he thinks.

37:33.142 --> 37:35.460
What was Waxey doing
at the Ritz?

37:35.491 --> 37:39.069
You're being addressed.

37:39.071 --> 37:41.721
<i>Meeting Nucky Thompson.</i>

37:41.755 --> 37:43.384
About what?

37:46.305 --> 37:48.457
It's all right,
you can tell me.

37:49.489 --> 37:52.246
Ships coming in.

37:52.280 --> 37:57.824
<i>- When?
- Tonight, 2:00,</i>

37:57.826 --> 38:00.258
from bill McCoy.

38:00.292 --> 38:02.934
Tell him where.

38:02.968 --> 38:05.763
Hog Island Boatyard.

38:05.905 --> 38:07.945
Right here in Philly.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.498
What does Nucky
need Gordon for?

38:22.859 --> 38:25.509
Come on, Herman.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.334
Protection.

38:27.368 --> 38:29.207
What do you know,
boychik?

38:29.340 --> 38:31.150
They're scared of us.

38:31.167 --> 38:33.319
Us?

38:34.561 --> 38:37.363
What's more valuable
than information?

38:37.551 --> 38:41.572
And here you get it
for free.

38:42.709 --> 38:44.381
Well, I'm not doing this.

38:44.383 --> 38:47.631
- Well, I can't touch him.
- Why not?

38:47.639 --> 38:51.736
He's injured.
That makes him treif.

38:51.771 --> 38:55.356
What? We all got
to live by rules.

38:59.532 --> 39:02.360
Unless you're
feeling squeamish.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.125
Hold this.

39:22.749 --> 39:25.783
Shh.

39:44.084 --> 39:46.621
Don't be nervous, dear.

39:48.575 --> 39:52.225
Stop, I'm sitting here!

40:26.239 --> 40:28.574
Bless me father,
for I have sinned.

40:28.608 --> 40:31.615
<i>It has been many years
since my last confession.</i>

40:31.650 --> 40:35.215
- How many?
- Four I think.

40:35.439 --> 40:37.284
Emily was an infant.

40:37.454 --> 40:39.582
<i>Why has it been so long?</i>

40:41.218 --> 40:45.447
The children, life.

40:47.873 --> 40:50.478
What have you to tell me?

40:52.405 --> 40:55.003
Forgive me, father,
but I've really nothing to say.

40:55.037 --> 40:58.501
<i>- You have no sins?
- Of course I do.</i>

40:58.535 --> 41:00.145
I just...

41:01.826 --> 41:03.191
When you sin, my child,

41:03.193 --> 41:07.060
you fracture your
relationship with God.

41:07.091 --> 41:09.184
Tell me honestly
what burdens you.

41:09.186 --> 41:13.828
<i>Search your soul so that
I may heal that fracture.</i>

41:19.516 --> 41:23.538
There is a man, father,
in my life.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.807
And he's bad.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.802
I know he is
in my heart.

41:29.881 --> 41:33.755
But still, I'm drawn
to him somehow.

41:33.834 --> 41:35.705
<i>Physically, you mean.</i>

41:36.776 --> 41:41.234
Yes, impurely
in my thoughts.

41:41.236 --> 41:46.052
This man... he provides
for you and your children?

41:46.074 --> 41:49.559
No.
He provides nothing.

41:49.593 --> 41:53.314
I hardly know him,
in fact.

41:53.424 --> 41:56.752
He works for my...
My family.

41:59.242 --> 42:01.221
"Don't be upset"?

42:01.255 --> 42:02.737
Are you fucking
kidding me?

42:02.771 --> 42:05.223
I feel terrible, Nucky,
but there's nothing I can do.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.575
Edge wants the kid replaced
with a real prosecutor.

42:07.610 --> 42:09.228
<i>You're the attorney general,
Harry.</i>

42:09.262 --> 42:12.225
Since when does a no-name
senator grab you by the balls?

42:12.259 --> 42:15.282
<i>Since the no-name senator
threatens an investigation.</i>

42:15.284 --> 42:17.100
What's to investigate?

42:17.102 --> 42:19.200
You've been in office
less than three months.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.611
There are things in the works
I can't discuss.

42:21.777 --> 42:24.379
<i>- So who is it?
- Who's what?</i>

42:24.422 --> 42:27.625
<i>- The prosecutor.
- I haven't decided yet.</i>

42:27.627 --> 42:29.792
Well, make it someone
I can work with, will you?

42:29.828 --> 42:32.704
<i>Well, I sent you the
Thorogood kid, didn't I?</i>

42:32.846 --> 42:34.199
A lot of help that was.

42:34.233 --> 42:35.768
It's not my fault
you have enemies.

42:36.028 --> 42:38.664
My ass is
on the line here, Harry.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.931
Well, so is mine, Nucky.
So is mine.

42:55.411 --> 42:57.524
Oh. Oh yeah.

42:57.571 --> 42:59.651
Oh. That's it, baby.

42:59.674 --> 43:01.151
Drill for oil.

43:02.990 --> 43:06.278
Ladies, get your things!

43:06.280 --> 43:07.597
What the hell is this?

43:07.598 --> 43:10.286
Mr. Thompson wishes you
to leave immediately.

43:12.515 --> 43:16.018
If... if this is some kinda
gag, it's not one bit funny.

43:16.052 --> 43:18.695
- There is no gag.
- Five minutes.

43:25.926 --> 43:28.075
Nice shoes.

43:29.792 --> 43:34.340
<i>** Professor Brown, MD,
a big composer, he **</i>

43:34.374 --> 43:39.552
<i>** tried vainly to think out
a brand-new melody **</i>

43:39.554 --> 43:42.153
<i>** then he got
an inspiration **</i>

43:42.187 --> 43:44.259
<i>** played it
with a wild elation **</i>

43:44.327 --> 43:46.957
<i>** he strummed it,
he drummed it... **</i>

43:46.959 --> 43:48.698
<i>** then he started to write,
he started to write... **</i>

43:48.732 --> 43:50.561
<i>** yes, he started
to write **</i>

43:50.595 --> 43:52.689
<i>** yes, he started
to write the scale **</i>

43:52.762 --> 43:56.915
<i>** DO RE MI FA **</i>

43:57.022 --> 44:01.551
<i>** SO LA TI DO **</i>

44:01.578 --> 44:05.301
<i>** when you hear
that simple raggy refrain **</i>

44:05.335 --> 44:07.728
<i>** that lilting strain **</i>

44:07.730 --> 44:10.811
<i>** you simply play and swing
and dance and sing **</i>

44:10.845 --> 44:14.971
<i>** well, when you hear
that simple raggy refrain **</i>

44:15.025 --> 44:18.404
<i>** you feel insane,
it burns your brain **</i>

44:18.438 --> 44:23.108
<i>** DO MI LA SO **</i>

44:23.110 --> 44:28.068
<i>** FA MI RE DO... **</i>

44:57.923 --> 45:01.549
Nelson,
where have you been?

45:01.551 --> 45:03.513
The chapel, sir.

45:05.273 --> 45:07.631
Has he spoken again?

45:07.680 --> 45:11.010
They've wired
his family in Montana.

45:14.501 --> 45:17.362
He's a good man, sir.

45:22.928 --> 45:25.119
An honest man.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.271
It should be me
in that bed.

45:29.305 --> 45:33.065
- Stop it, Nelson.
- It's true, sir.

45:43.799 --> 45:46.088
I have something
I need to tell you.

45:51.570 --> 45:54.567
<i>- I...
- I see you.</i>

45:59.883 --> 46:01.800
- I know.
- Hush now.

46:01.849 --> 46:06.234
<i>- Relax.
- I see you.</i>

46:06.268 --> 46:09.750
<i>I know. Why is he saying that?</i>

46:09.925 --> 46:12.897
- He's delirious. Pay no attention.
- I see you.

46:12.899 --> 46:15.720
<i>He's been saying
that to everyone.</i>

46:15.767 --> 46:18.217
I see you.

46:18.265 --> 46:20.421
<i>I know what you did.</i>

46:20.443 --> 46:23.206
Come out of there.

46:24.722 --> 46:27.282
I know that you're hiding.

46:27.284 --> 46:30.899
<i>It's not fair.</i>

46:31.095 --> 46:34.341
You ate the pie.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.244
<i>I'll tell ma.</i>

46:39.111 --> 46:41.895
I'll tell ma.

46:49.117 --> 46:51.246
I need to leave, sir.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.488
You wanted a word
in private?

46:53.541 --> 46:57.591
- No, it's not necessary.
- He doesn't have much longer, sir.

47:48.350 --> 47:50.710
Lucy?

48:18.970 --> 48:22.226
I...

48:23.923 --> 48:27.035
I brought lemons.

48:33.106 --> 48:36.035
I did it all myself.

48:48.188 --> 48:50.957
It's a girl.

48:59.774 --> 49:02.335
I'll get a doctor.

50:06.298 --> 50:07.716
The fuck happened?

50:07.718 --> 50:09.539
Coffee break.
The fuck you think?

50:09.579 --> 50:11.081
Tire blew.

50:11.129 --> 50:12.567
We hit a nail
or something.

50:12.698 --> 50:14.864
They ain't paying us
enough for this shit.

50:17.337 --> 50:18.938
That ain't
no fucking nail...

50:56.322 --> 50:58.565
Drop your weapons!

51:05.733 --> 51:08.785
<i>Throw your guns out
and no one gets hurt!</i>

51:13.085 --> 51:14.826
Darmody?

51:15.784 --> 51:19.132
- Who's there?
- It's lucky!

51:20.439 --> 51:24.010
- Identify yourself!
- It's Luciano, God damn it!

51:26.001 --> 51:28.078
You know these fellas?

51:31.513 --> 51:33.256
All right,
come out then.

51:36.792 --> 51:39.307
How we know you ain't
gonna shoot us?

51:41.359 --> 51:43.184
I'm not gonna shoot you.

52:06.713 --> 52:08.397
The fuck are you doing?

52:08.399 --> 52:11.958
- We're making a delivery.
- For Nucky Thompson?

52:11.992 --> 52:13.889
He cut a deal
with rothstein

52:13.934 --> 52:15.502
to import his liquor
through Philly.

52:15.536 --> 52:17.194
Under the auspices
of Waxey Gordon.

52:17.196 --> 52:19.330
And you fellas
are the muscle?

52:19.354 --> 52:21.483
I don't fucking
believe this.

52:21.517 --> 52:23.276
All this is for Nucky?

52:24.773 --> 52:28.500
- Chalky White's back in business.
- Jesus Christ.

52:29.777 --> 52:32.072
What do you wanna do?

52:41.042 --> 52:42.687
If I may.

52:46.438 --> 52:48.263
This could be an opportunity,
gentlemen.

52:48.297 --> 52:49.785
The fuck
you talking about?

52:49.892 --> 52:53.491
We have spoken to you
about partnering up.

52:54.947 --> 52:58.202
Heroin...
Better opportunities.

52:58.236 --> 52:59.668
That's right.

52:59.702 --> 53:02.530
So why kill each other over a
few trucks' worth of liquor?

53:02.564 --> 53:06.457
You work with Waxey Gordon.
The man's a piece of shit.

53:06.459 --> 53:08.403
Not every insult
requires a response.

53:08.432 --> 53:10.911
A hundred grand there,
boychik,

53:10.937 --> 53:12.470
five of which is mine.

53:12.522 --> 53:14.777
So they'll advance us.

53:20.084 --> 53:21.604
Sure.

53:21.638 --> 53:24.764
You can't kill
everyone, Manny.

53:24.799 --> 53:27.033
It's not good business.

53:34.074 --> 53:37.259
Look,
so we let you go,

53:37.293 --> 53:38.728
you deliver the load
to Chalky.

53:38.762 --> 53:41.005
Nucky Thompson
is none the wiser.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.453
And then what?

53:42.483 --> 53:45.476
And then we meet up
separately

53:45.510 --> 53:48.247
and we figure a way
to take it all.

53:48.432 --> 53:52.959
It's kismet, gentlemen.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.973
Rothstein, Nucky...

53:55.979 --> 53:57.996
Their time is passed.

53:58.031 --> 53:59.655
Waxey Gordon's ain't.

53:59.864 --> 54:04.168
Eh, let us worry
about Waxey.

54:15.404 --> 54:19.181
Leave the car.
You ride with me.

54:22.317 --> 54:24.546
It's a good thing, fellas.

54:24.548 --> 54:26.661
You'll see.

54:36.102 --> 54:38.358
Let's go.

54:53.601 --> 54:56.684
<i>She's in the bedroom.</i>

56:01.277 --> 56:04.179
She has a slight fever.

56:05.135 --> 56:07.470
Rose.

56:07.481 --> 56:10.164
I'll get out
of your way, doctor.

56:14.375 --> 56:16.805
What are you doing here?

56:16.839 --> 56:19.813
On the phone
you sounded distraught.

56:19.854 --> 56:21.230
I caught the first train
I could.

56:21.231 --> 56:22.974
Agent Sawicki
gave me the address.

56:22.975 --> 56:23.512
Rose...

56:23.513 --> 56:26.461
Of course now I can see
what was really worrying you.

56:27.073 --> 56:29.963
I did this for us.

56:29.997 --> 56:32.503
That child is for you.

56:32.505 --> 56:33.936
I...

56:33.970 --> 56:37.032
Don't touch me!
Don't you touch me!

56:37.077 --> 56:38.870
Don't you touch me!

56:38.911 --> 56:40.537
Rose, Rose!

56:40.574 --> 56:45.348
Rose, please.
Get ahold of yourself.

56:45.394 --> 56:47.972
Aah!

57:04.011 --> 57:08.985
<i>** it seems so long ago **</i>

57:09.081 --> 57:14.247
<i>** although
'twas only yesterday **</i>

57:14.282 --> 57:17.344
<i>- ** when just... **
- stand nice and tall.</i>

57:17.378 --> 57:19.398
Hold the candle
in your left hand.

57:20.732 --> 57:26.149
<i>** our lives should part
for aye **</i>

57:26.349 --> 57:28.772
<i>** with faith
so strong... **</i>

57:28.774 --> 57:31.376
so I trust
your soul is pure?

57:33.327 --> 57:36.069
Your confession.

57:36.180 --> 57:39.561
Yes, I'm sure it is.
