WEBVTT

00:03.034 --> 00:07.304
Hello and welcome.
We've got a luxury theme tonight.

00:07.304 --> 00:10.474
A drinks globe with Tia Maria in it,

00:10.474 --> 00:15.774
an onyx coffee table,
that's a sumptuous Wall's Viennetta,

00:15.774 --> 00:20.834
and, appropriately, that is
the new Rolls Royce Phantom.

00:20.834 --> 00:25.494
Have you ever seen anything
quite so enormous?

00:25.494 --> 00:30.274
Look at this. This is
the wheel from our Suzuki Liana.

00:30.274 --> 00:35.004
Compare it, if you will,
to the wheel of the Rolls Royce.

00:35.004 --> 00:39.314
And that is its engine!
A 6.7 litre V12.

00:39.314 --> 00:44.074
Last time I was in anything with an
engine that big, it had a captain!

00:44.074 --> 00:47.654
Everything about this car is vast.

00:47.654 --> 00:53.714
To test it, I took it to the home
of that other automotive colossus.

00:53.714 --> 00:56.384
John Prescott.
LAUGHTER

00:56.384 --> 00:58.634
I went to Hull.

00:58.634 --> 01:01.262
CLASSICAL MUSIC

01:07.694 --> 01:12.484
This is nice. No rev counter -
I have a "power reserve dial".

01:12.484 --> 01:16.964
I'm doing 60 miles an hour
and according to that,

01:16.964 --> 01:23.574
I've got 90% of the engine's power
in reserve, just in case
of emergencies. That's good.

01:25.804 --> 01:32.064
In the old Rolls Royces, the ones
from the '60s and '70s, '80s even,

01:32.064 --> 01:35.654
there was wind noise,
tyre noise, engine noise.

01:35.654 --> 01:40.504
You could hear the clock at 100
miles an hour because it was loud!

01:40.504 --> 01:45.191
But this is like a whisper
in the vestry.

01:50.594 --> 01:53.006
HARSH TECHNO MUSIC

01:56.454 --> 02:03.053
It's a frugal car too.
I drove it to Yorkshire
and got 18 miles to the gallon!

02:07.884 --> 02:12.444
It's quieter and more economical
than I expected.

02:12.444 --> 02:15.464
And it's easier to drive.

02:15.464 --> 02:20.044
I imagined that driving this car
through a village

02:20.044 --> 02:24.824
would be like trying to thread
an oil rig through a letter box.

02:24.824 --> 02:29.444
But it's not that difficult.
It's 14 miles long,

02:29.444 --> 02:36.168
but it's quite narrow.
It's six inches narrower than
a Range Rover, so it's quite easy.

02:39.184 --> 02:42.444
I'm not distracted by toys, either.

02:42.444 --> 02:49.104
In most luxury cars there are lots
of buttons which let you tailor
everything, "just so".

02:49.104 --> 02:54.324
Let me show you the radio as
a prime example. There's one knob.

02:54.324 --> 03:01.034
Push it and Terry Wogan comes into
the car. Turn it, he gets louder.

03:01.034 --> 03:03.824
Push it again and he goes away.

03:03.824 --> 03:07.104
Then there's the gear arrangement.

03:07.104 --> 03:14.164
Tiptronic? I don't think so.
I've got backwards, neutral
and forwards. And that's it.

03:14.164 --> 03:20.824
It seems this car represents
an old-fashioned approach
to luxury motoring.

03:20.824 --> 03:23.884
And I rather like that.

03:23.884 --> 03:26.644
FOGHORN BLARES

03:26.644 --> 03:33.464
Normally, I must be honest,
I don't find the doors on a car
particularly interesting. Unless...

03:33.464 --> 03:35.104
SOFT CLUNK

03:35.104 --> 03:38.724
.. it doesn't have any.
But, look at this.

03:38.724 --> 03:43.274
Not only does this open backwards,
but in here we find...

03:43.274 --> 03:45.624
an umbrella.

03:45.624 --> 03:51.944
Rolls Royce
is making a big deal about this.
Not sure why cos you get it...

03:51.944 --> 03:58.154
on a Skoda Superb. It's the only
thing that's "superb" about it.

03:58.154 --> 04:02.904
Inside I simply push this button
here to close the door because

04:02.904 --> 04:07.264
obviously I can't be bothered
to do it myself.

04:07.264 --> 04:11.874
Then I'm cocooned
in this world of elegant simplicity.

04:11.874 --> 04:14.464
I love the leather and aluminium.

04:14.464 --> 04:19.074
This Art Deco light in here,
the handles and the roof.

04:19.074 --> 04:23.044
That... is...fabulous.

04:23.044 --> 04:28.864
Then you've got the thick carpets
and these picnic tables.

04:28.864 --> 04:34.414
You might think that the back
is the best place to be.

04:34.414 --> 04:36.904
Calming, nice.

04:36.904 --> 04:42.547
But actually, the Rolls
is amazingly good fun to drive.

04:46.554 --> 04:50.944
Nought to 60 in 5.7 seconds

04:50.944 --> 04:53.634
and a top speed of 150.

04:53.634 --> 05:00.540
That's fast by anyone's standards,
especially as the wheels
don't appear to go round.

05:01.714 --> 05:05.832
And it's not just good
in a straight line either.

05:10.914 --> 05:16.114
Don't misunderstand me.
It's far from sporty.

05:16.114 --> 05:18.617
But it's not a hovercraft either.

05:21.834 --> 05:25.274
I didn't want to like this car.

05:25.274 --> 05:31.874
I wanted to say it was too big,
too German, too vulgar.
But it's won me over.

05:31.874 --> 05:37.074
Since it began, Rolls Royce said
it makes the best car in the world.

05:37.074 --> 05:42.594
Now, for 80 years
that hasn't really been the case.

05:42.594 --> 05:44.960
It is now, though!

05:50.994 --> 05:55.636
Once again,
the Spirit of Ecstasy is just that.

05:58.214 --> 06:01.294
And here we are, at journey's end.

06:01.294 --> 06:06.425
The real reason for coming
to Hull...the Humber Bridge.

06:09.024 --> 06:14.803
For 17 years, the longest
suspension bridge in the world.

06:22.054 --> 06:28.934
The towers are
one-and-a-half inches further apart
at the top than the bottom,

06:28.934 --> 06:32.554
thanks to the curvature
of the earth.

06:32.554 --> 06:37.304
There's enough steel in the cabling
here to go round the world twice.

06:37.304 --> 06:40.934
It's British steel,
British designed,

06:40.934 --> 06:46.094
British-engineered and
British-built with British money.

06:46.094 --> 06:51.327
We have the talent in this country
to make stuff like this.

06:53.354 --> 06:56.414
So...why can't we do it today?

07:03.554 --> 07:07.104
The design of this car is British.

07:07.104 --> 07:11.564
The chief engineer
who worked on it is British.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.084
The engine comes from Germany.

07:14.084 --> 07:18.824
So does the gearbox, the brakes,
the suspension and body.

07:18.824 --> 07:23.954
Even the leather on the seats comes
from a flock of cows in Bavaria.

07:23.954 --> 07:30.994
All we do in this country
is put all the bits together
and nail the dashboard in place.

07:30.994 --> 07:33.565
It's pathetic.

07:40.424 --> 07:46.224
This is a great car. An awesome car.
A bit showy perhaps,

07:46.224 --> 07:51.274
and hard to park, but mostly
a majestic, inspiring, serene

07:51.274 --> 07:55.644
and glorious blend of style
and engineering.

07:55.644 --> 08:00.104
I just wish
it was like the Humber Bridge.

08:00.104 --> 08:05.326
I wish it was something
we could be proud of.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:21.894 --> 08:28.174
Thanks! You've made me feel good
about being British... and stupid.
And useless. Sorry.

08:28.174 --> 08:32.724
The British and Germans do good
stuff. The new Mini? Yep.

08:32.724 --> 08:38.164
The Range Rover? Mmm. And this.
You're absolutely right, actually.

08:38.164 --> 08:41.294
Germans on their own are useless.

08:41.294 --> 08:47.534
All leather shorts and oompah
music designing a Mercedes Maybach.

08:47.534 --> 08:52.324
Maybach's a case in point.
It costs the same - £250,000.

08:52.324 --> 08:57.294
It's the same size,
but it's just a stretch Mercedes.

08:57.294 --> 09:01.644
They've shoved a branch of Dixons
in the front

09:01.644 --> 09:06.384
and fitted DFS leatherette
reclining sofas in the back.

09:06.384 --> 09:11.894
This is the only true luxury car.
I can explain why. Look. Mmm.

09:11.894 --> 09:16.694
They could've taken a big BMW and
stuffed it full of kit, as you said.

09:16.694 --> 09:21.364
But they went to this and thought,
"What's luxury really about? "

09:21.364 --> 09:24.814
Not gadgets.
It's about peace and quiet,

09:24.814 --> 09:28.604
and light and air and space,
big space.

09:28.604 --> 09:32.964
You can't have a luxury caravan,
can you? No.

09:32.964 --> 09:38.354
Rolls Royce does have a problem.
I was talking to an Arab friend.

09:38.354 --> 09:44.384
He's got a Ferrari F40, an F50,
he's got an Enzo coming.

09:44.384 --> 09:48.724
A Bentley, a Jaguar XJ220,
a Porsche 959

09:48.724 --> 09:53.094
and a Toyota Previa for his wife.
LAUGHTER

09:53.094 --> 09:58.064
He was saying, "I don't want a new
Rolls Royce, they're too flash. "

09:58.064 --> 10:04.624
Yes. I look at that
beautiful woman on the grille
and do you know what I think?

10:04.624 --> 10:09.624
What? Jimmy Saville.
LAUGHTER

10:09.624 --> 10:16.584
And this is it. This is the crux.
Rolls Royce has built
a magnificent car.

10:16.584 --> 10:20.264
They must be careful
who they sell it to.

10:20.264 --> 10:25.264
Nobody called James.
James Saville, James Greaves, no.

10:25.264 --> 10:27.784
James Tarbuck, not a chance.

10:27.784 --> 10:34.104
James...YOU! James May, he can't
have one either. Sorry, mate.

10:34.104 --> 10:37.904
So, the Cool Board.
Where does the Rolls go?

10:37.904 --> 10:42.594
Right now it has been "Tarbucked"
with the Saville brush.

10:42.594 --> 10:45.984
So it can only be uncool,
I'm afraid.

10:45.984 --> 10:49.064
But I'll put this proviso on it.

10:49.064 --> 10:52.704
It'll stay there
till I open Heat magazine

10:52.704 --> 10:57.984
and there's one outside a nightclub
with a member of AC/DC falling out

10:57.984 --> 11:00.584
into a pool of his own sick.

11:00.584 --> 11:02.264
LAUGHTER

11:02.264 --> 11:05.484
Then it's gonna go straight there.

11:05.484 --> 11:11.554
It'll never happen. Sadly, no rock
star will ever buy the Rolls Royce.

11:11.554 --> 11:15.331
It's too big to fit
in a swimming pool.

11:16.464 --> 11:22.984
The Ferrari Enzo? Mmm. Three of
these sold in this country so far.

11:22.984 --> 11:27.064
I think, all of them to rock stars?
True enough.

11:27.064 --> 11:29.484
Eric Clapton has one.

11:29.484 --> 11:34.904
Jay Kay has got one and the drummer
of Pink Floyd is getting one.

11:34.904 --> 11:40.674
Even with the rock star effect,
it is not cool. What do we think?

11:40.674 --> 11:46.274
It's trying too hard. Hold on
a minute, why is the Enzo cool?

11:46.274 --> 11:52.294
It's got everything that
the McLaren F1 was ten years ago.
For that, it's cool.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.624
I nodded off in the middle of that!

11:55.624 --> 12:00.634
Where they're going wrong is this -
the Kristin Scott Thomas test.

12:00.634 --> 12:03.284
Precisely. Here she is, look.

12:03.284 --> 12:10.395
If you pull up to take her out
in a Ferrari Enzo, she'll say, "No,
can we go in my husband's Laguna?"

12:11.624 --> 12:14.594
I've got the new Audi A3.

12:14.594 --> 12:16.474
Cool.

12:16.474 --> 12:21.774
No, that's uncool! There's a man
here I happen to know has an A3.

12:21.774 --> 12:26.774
They're wonderful cars to drive.
You've got a beard! So?!

12:26.774 --> 12:29.294
LAUGHTER

12:29.294 --> 12:36.014
If you're gonna have an Audi,
buy an Audi not a VW Golf
that looks like an Audi.

12:36.014 --> 12:38.814
I think that's an uncool car.

12:38.814 --> 12:41.414
No, it isn't. It's uncool!

12:41.414 --> 12:46.644
I know he's got a beard, but that's
a cool car. Wrong! No, it's cool.

12:46.644 --> 12:50.434
And if you wanna do something
about it...

12:50.434 --> 12:53.964
LAUGHTER

12:53.964 --> 12:58.874
I like a reasoned debate.
Now, I think that's pretty much...

12:58.874 --> 13:01.774
I'm gonna put this Alfa up here.

13:01.774 --> 13:03.914
AUDIENCE: No!

13:03.914 --> 13:06.774
Yes!
Yes. Thank you, yes.

13:06.774 --> 13:10.434
LAUGHTER

13:10.434 --> 13:13.437
APPLAUSE

13:17.654 --> 13:23.661
JeryT
Thank you.

13:26.374 --> 13:32.774
A few weeks ago,
there were some local elections
and the turnout was dreadful.

13:32.774 --> 13:38.174
People started wailing about voter
apathy and the death of democracy.

13:38.174 --> 13:43.904
It's got nothing to do with any
of that. It's cos voting is boring!

13:43.904 --> 13:47.734
So we thought
we could revolutionise democracy

13:47.734 --> 13:53.234
by deciding the result of the next
election using an MG ZR race car.

13:53.234 --> 13:58.444
The major political parties have
sent representatives to take part

13:58.444 --> 14:02.934
and the first is from
the Legalise Cannabis Alliance.

14:02.934 --> 14:06.574
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:06.574 --> 14:10.294
Big party? Small.
This is Mark Gibson.

14:10.294 --> 14:15.854
From the Official Monster Raving
Loony Party... Hooray! Whoo!

14:15.854 --> 14:19.744
..this is Alan "Howling Laud" Hope.

14:19.744 --> 14:27.044
Alan has no experience of this sort
of thing, but does have a Hyundai
and a cat that died recently.

14:27.044 --> 14:29.454
High hopes here!

14:29.454 --> 14:32.304
From the Green Party, Ian Dickson.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.134
Hello. You do know
what you're here to do?

14:36.134 --> 14:41.744
Yes. There's no bus lane and you'll
have to take your cycle clips off.

14:41.744 --> 14:45.574
From the Liberal Democrat Party,
John Ault.

14:45.574 --> 14:47.744
AUDIENCE BOOS

14:47.744 --> 14:49.854
LAUGHTER

14:49.854 --> 14:52.694
It's getting scary in here!

14:52.694 --> 14:58.774
Now, I don't know if this is right,
but you're the only Lib Dem opposed
to speed bumps.

14:58.774 --> 15:04.076
I don't like them unless there's two
together so I can jump the second!

15:05.334 --> 15:09.384
From Labour, Richard Burden.
Wahey!

15:10.904 --> 15:17.204
It's one.
You have done some racing.
Bits and pieces.

15:17.204 --> 15:17.204
Finally, from the Tory party...

15:17.204 --> 15:21.424
Finally, from the Tory party...
AUDIENCE BOOS

15:21.424 --> 15:28.004
..the Shadow Defence Secretary
himself, Bernard Jenkin.
This isn't him, obviously.

15:28.004 --> 15:32.204
Bernard can't make it here tonight
because he's in Iraq.

15:32.204 --> 15:37.144
I don't know why you'd want
to be in Iraq. That's your fault!

15:37.144 --> 15:41.944
Your boss was told by his boss
in America to have a war and he did

15:41.944 --> 15:44.504
and Bernard can't be here. Gone.

15:44.504 --> 15:48.094
I haven't.
He made it for the big day. Yes.

15:48.094 --> 15:53.264
Just think, by the end of tonight
we could have a new government.

15:53.264 --> 15:58.404
We'll find out how they all did
a bit later on. First, the news.

15:58.404 --> 16:01.994
Anyone who's seen an aerial photo
of London

16:01.994 --> 16:06.604
will have noticed the blue bus lane
running through the middle.

16:06.604 --> 16:12.404
It's the Thames. Get buses off the
road and make them go on the river.

16:12.404 --> 16:19.224
We've had a letter from a company
this week, saying they've built
such a thing. Look at that.

16:19.224 --> 16:21.744
It's a bus boat.

16:21.744 --> 16:28.063
It's goes down the river
and pulls out at the far end.
That's fantastic!

16:28.063 --> 16:30.833
The bloke says he wants backing.

16:30.833 --> 16:35.563
You won't get any from us. We spend
our money on petrol and crisps.

16:35.563 --> 16:41.243
But anything that gets buses
off the road is a good idea.

16:41.243 --> 16:46.263
Spending time in traffic is no fun.
We all have to do that.

16:46.263 --> 16:53.683
This is a new service. It's called
"motor flirting". Motor what?
Flirting? Motor flirting.

16:53.683 --> 17:00.023
Members display a sticker
in the back window of their car
with the logo on it.

17:00.023 --> 17:04.762
Another member, when they see that
they think, "They look nice, "

17:04.762 --> 17:11.683
they can contact this service,
give them the reg and they can send
text messages to that person.

17:11.683 --> 17:17.262
Fat ugly blokes will be sending
each other text messages! Him! Him!

17:17.262 --> 17:20.213
They will be texting each other!

17:20.213 --> 17:28.133
"Instead of gazing through the
windscreen, text the motorist you
fancy! " There you go, have that!

17:28.133 --> 17:32.563
I can straightaway
see another use for this.

17:32.563 --> 17:36.023
You can contact people
in other cars.

17:36.023 --> 17:39.563
You're on the motorway.
Say it's not foggy.

17:39.563 --> 17:43.133
And somebody in front
has their fog light on.

17:43.133 --> 17:47.933
You can send them a playful text
message to the effect...

17:47.933 --> 17:52.823
Turn it off! Turn it off.
123-year-old man, turn it off!

17:52.823 --> 17:55.041
LAUGHTER
Precisely!

17:59.463 --> 18:01.933
The Queen of England

18:01.933 --> 18:04.538
had a Rover P5.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.493
I know because I'm sitting in it.

18:09.493 --> 18:13.343
This IS the Queen's Rover P5.

18:13.343 --> 18:17.553
When she ordered this,
she had a fleet of Rolls Royces.

18:17.553 --> 18:21.023
They were chauffeur-driven.
This, she drove herself.

18:21.023 --> 18:23.799
This was more your midweek luxury.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.353
There were two shapes -
the upright saloon

18:30.353 --> 18:36.633
and the coupe which, despite being
the coupe, still had four doors.

18:36.633 --> 18:41.133
But it's this lowered roof line
that butches up the image

18:41.133 --> 18:43.833
and makes it look more caddish.

18:43.833 --> 18:48.273
Inside it was the poor man's Roller,
but still luxurious.

18:48.273 --> 18:55.843
The holy trinity are here -
leather, wood and shag pile.
It's solid, regal and dignified.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.253
"Gentleman's club on wheels"

18:58.253 --> 19:03.573
may be a tired cliche today, but
it was actually coined for this car.

19:03.573 --> 19:07.693
It was the backbone of England.

19:07.693 --> 19:13.413
Harold Wilson had one and
he had a pipe rest fitted to it.

19:13.413 --> 19:18.293
CHEERING AND BOOING
Maggie Thatcher,

19:18.293 --> 19:23.893
when she drove round shouting
at trade unionists, she had one.

19:23.893 --> 19:27.933
But beneath that cosy tradition
lay modernity.

19:27.933 --> 19:33.073
It was Rover's first use
of a monocoque shell.

19:33.073 --> 19:38.643
It could've handled worse than a
Sumo wrestler at a roller disco -

19:38.643 --> 19:43.413
it barely had enough power to
challenge the most rotten chassis.

19:43.413 --> 19:50.353
It struggled along with Rover's
flaccid 3L from 1958-1967.

19:50.353 --> 19:53.853
Yeah, the P5 would do 65mph,

19:53.853 --> 19:57.193
but it took 17 seconds to get there.

19:57.193 --> 20:00.263
And yes it would do 100mph

20:00.263 --> 20:03.633
but not without a fight.

20:03.633 --> 20:07.643
In 1967, the Rover P5
got the engine it deserved.

20:07.643 --> 20:10.653
And the Rover 3.5L V8 was born.

20:10.653 --> 20:13.563
She finally had enough grunt

20:13.563 --> 20:17.953
to shake the rough shag
out of Wilson's pipe.

20:17.953 --> 20:20.808
It does make a nice noise.

20:23.713 --> 20:29.208
That is a great noise! The trees
are moving a bit faster, too.

20:33.313 --> 20:38.413
Shame it happened in the year his
transport minister, Barbara Castle,

20:38.413 --> 20:40.688
introduced the 70mph speed limit.

20:46.313 --> 20:50.203
So the 3.5L V8 engine

20:50.203 --> 20:55.223
Rover P5B coupe is the one to
go for if you're buying one today.

20:55.223 --> 20:59.993
You can get
a really good one for £8,000

20:59.993 --> 21:04.703
and a really, really good one
closer to £11,000.

21:08.943 --> 21:13.813
Like an elderly relative,
it will need care and attention

21:13.813 --> 21:17.463
and you'll have to keep
an eye on it.

21:17.463 --> 21:22.383
It hasn't got satellite-navigated,
remote-controlled airbag gizmos.

21:22.383 --> 21:27.223
But it has something else. It has
innate luxuriousness. Ingrained.

21:27.223 --> 21:30.183
The Rover had luxury built into it.

21:30.183 --> 21:34.403
It's as English
as an oven glove with cats on.

21:34.403 --> 21:38.583
Just think how comforting
its upright posture

21:38.583 --> 21:45.603
must've been to the ex-public
schoolboys running the banks,
industry and, indeed, the nation.

21:45.603 --> 21:53.383
When you're used to cold baths
and cross-country runs, a Rover P5
must've been a welcome sight.

21:53.383 --> 21:57.423
It's a plate of mashed potato
on a refectory table.

21:57.423 --> 22:01.383
I want to call it Nursey -
I bet some people did.

22:01.383 --> 22:03.783
Just like Nursey,

22:03.783 --> 22:08.543
the P5's starchy exterior conceals
a warm and comforting bosom

22:08.543 --> 22:12.832
that makes everything all right
with the world.

22:22.262 --> 22:27.782
Channel Four ran a programme
and named the 100 worst Britons.

22:27.782 --> 22:30.672
I was a deserving 66.

22:30.672 --> 22:33.602
But my guest tonight thrashed me.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.612
Welcome Britain's 28th worst person,
Jamie Oliver!

22:37.612 --> 22:42.788
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:49.622 --> 22:53.042
That was a man.
I thought it was a bird.

22:53.042 --> 22:59.052
I think his name's Cindy.
It isn't Cindy, mate. It's a bloke.

22:59.052 --> 23:03.622
As it's our luxury programme,
have a Rocher. Thanks.

23:03.622 --> 23:06.542
Maltesers that have won the Pools.

23:06.542 --> 23:11.182
They get stuck in my throat.
We glued them together.

23:11.182 --> 23:14.902
Let's talk about cars -
no, your scooter.

23:14.902 --> 23:17.882
Yeah. Why do you have a scooter?

23:17.882 --> 23:22.522
The scooter's the
fastest method of travel in London.

23:22.522 --> 23:28.542
I'm fed up with sitting in traffic
in London. Drives me mad.

23:28.542 --> 23:34.402
The scooter... I'd beat any Ferrari
in London. 3am, Baker Street.

23:34.402 --> 23:39.262
LAUGHTER
You had a crash on it on television.

23:39.262 --> 23:45.422
Several - oh, God, lately, yeah!
Tell the nice people what happened.

23:45.422 --> 23:50.882
We were in Chicago and went on the
Oprah Winfrey Show, quite exciting.

23:50.882 --> 23:55.762
And they did this little VT
of the things I've done.

23:55.762 --> 24:00.542
"With Jamie Oliver! " And I drove
in between the audience.

24:00.542 --> 24:03.182
A very proud moment -

24:03.182 --> 24:07.822
this beautifully lit studio,
wonderful flowers and Oprah smiling.

24:07.822 --> 24:12.902
You know when cars slip and you
correct it? There was none of that.

24:12.902 --> 24:17.662
I just went straight on the floor
and I skidded on my front

24:17.662 --> 24:20.482
about four or five metres.

24:20.482 --> 24:25.402
They had an awkward family of eaters
from Chicago at a table for four

24:25.402 --> 24:28.902
and I was going straight for them.

24:28.902 --> 24:32.142
It was really scary, but great.

24:32.142 --> 24:37.292
Did they leave it in? They did,
yeah. They thought I was a stunt man.

24:37.292 --> 24:44.152
Having a scooter is better than
your car. It's a bit cold and wet.

24:44.152 --> 24:47.042
And you've got a Maserati. Yeah.

24:47.042 --> 24:50.102
What possessed you to do that?

24:50.102 --> 24:54.182
It looks beautiful,
they're great value.

24:54.182 --> 24:59.472
They're very fast, they sound
beautiful. Do you not agree, guys?

24:59.472 --> 25:04.932
They won't agree! Oh... They know
about cars. That's why they're here.

25:04.932 --> 25:09.782
But you drive a hairdresser's car
what can you say!

25:09.782 --> 25:15.282
Your Stig took me out in it and
I've never been so scared in my life.

25:15.282 --> 25:17.942
And erm... he crashed it.

25:17.942 --> 25:23.342
Did he? He crashed it on the corner
and smashed up the wheels.

25:23.342 --> 25:27.992
How did he do it? After, he said,
"I'm sorry about that.

25:27.992 --> 25:35.472
"I could've missed that ditch,
but I wanted to show you how it
goes sideways. " Thanks very much.

25:35.472 --> 25:40.992
Seriously. I'm sorry to have to do
this... We rang your restaurant

25:40.992 --> 25:45.282
to find out what you
and your business know about cars.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.632
It's 15, yeah? Yeah.

25:47.632 --> 25:54.152
If you ring, a recorded message
says you can have lunch in...
Three or four months?

25:54.152 --> 25:59.742
July. And for dinner you have to
wait till December. A long time.

25:59.742 --> 26:07.052
So we said, "Could we have a table
for four, for Nigel Mansell?"
Guess when he can have a table.

26:07.052 --> 26:10.442
Three or four months? Friday.

26:11.572 --> 26:15.972
Really? You don't want "mono-brow"
in your restaurant, OK?

26:15.972 --> 26:19.832
It was a trick, so cross him out
of the book... OK...

26:19.832 --> 26:22.392
Don't forget - we are a charity.

26:22.392 --> 26:28.212
Do you know what's funnier?
The next day we booked
for Gilles Villeneuve.

26:28.212 --> 26:31.612
He's dead!

26:31.612 --> 26:36.252
You know what I did?
I phoned and pretended to be you,

26:36.252 --> 26:40.541
and they wouldn't give me a table
till December!

26:45.212 --> 26:47.772
You are an Essex boy, yeah?

26:47.772 --> 26:52.412
Yes. Do you do the Essex thing
with cars - tart them up...

26:52.412 --> 26:56.082
I think it's the lead in the water
or something,

26:56.082 --> 27:01.132
but everyone buys dodgy cars
and does 'em up with spoilers...

27:01.132 --> 27:05.632
At one point my car was worth £800,
and my stereo £1,300!

27:05.632 --> 27:09.982
It's just pathetic,
but I was there, so I'm guilty.

27:09.982 --> 27:14.212
But you're still at it today -
you've got a camper van.

27:14.212 --> 27:18.532
Oh, yeah. But not a normal
camper van. It's beautiful.

27:18.532 --> 27:22.252
Just talk us through it.
It's behind us!

27:22.252 --> 27:27.082
I love it dearly. I just wish it
worked more reliably.

27:27.082 --> 27:31.722
What have you done to that?
I've kept it pretty original,

27:31.722 --> 27:37.782
but I've got a pull-out double bed,
a kitchen, TV, DVD and all that
sort of stuff.

27:37.782 --> 27:42.537
But I have got a Porsche 3. 6L engine
in the back, which...

27:43.712 --> 27:46.582
We had this brilliant idea,

27:46.582 --> 27:50.912
where we thought we'd see
if Jamie could cook in his van,

27:50.912 --> 27:55.792
while going round our track
with the Stig driving.

27:55.792 --> 27:59.592
Anyone want to see what happened?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

28:01.522 --> 28:08.932
What we'll make is a beautiful
salad of mozzarella, fig, rocket,
mint - all those beautiful things.

28:08.932 --> 28:11.935
I wanna tear up my mozzarella...

28:13.182 --> 28:16.754
I wanna take the tips off my figs.
Oh, my Lord...

28:18.512 --> 28:22.983
And what I wanna do, is...
put the olive oil in...

28:27.362 --> 28:29.466
Just dress the salad...

28:33.622 --> 28:35.146
Aaaaah!

28:37.002 --> 28:39.493
Still making the salad!

28:41.602 --> 28:45.174
If you toss this up
and put it on there...

28:46.432 --> 28:49.344
Hopefully, it'll look nice.

28:59.002 --> 29:03.722
That was horrible,
and I felt really sick afterwards.

29:03.722 --> 29:10.362
Was he going for it? He was,
but I couldn't see anything. I
wanted to show off and make it good -

29:10.362 --> 29:14.022
"Whatever he does, I'll make it
look beautiful. "

29:14.022 --> 29:17.423
But when the car went, I was like,
"Aaaargh. "

29:18.602 --> 29:24.442
You're not here just to fool around
on our track with your Maserati.

29:24.442 --> 29:29.722
You're the Star In A Reasonably
Priced Car. You see how fast...

29:29.722 --> 29:33.082
Yeah! I forgot about this!
..A Suzuki Liana.

29:33.082 --> 29:38.042
Here's a list of people who've done
it, in this and the last series.

29:38.042 --> 29:44.482
Is there anyone you'd like to beat?
Who do you think I wanted to beat?
AUDIENCE: Gordon Ramsay.

29:44.482 --> 29:50.812
He's a good friend of mine
and I've spent my life chasing him,
and I want to beat him once.

29:50.812 --> 29:57.212
But Gordon did it in exactly
the same time as me,
so you'll beat me too.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.482
That's all right.

29:59.482 --> 30:02.962
Shall we see how you got on?

30:02.962 --> 30:09.083
If I beat you I'll be the happiest
boy in the world. And the deadest.
Let's have a look.

30:11.692 --> 30:17.492
Gordon had a better start than that.
You should have gone to Specsavers!

30:17.492 --> 30:23.602
Your window's down! You won't beat
Gordon, cos he had his window up!

30:23.602 --> 30:25.532
Yes, my son!

30:25.532 --> 30:27.722
That is really tight there.

30:27.722 --> 30:30.442
Did I hit the camera? No.

30:30.442 --> 30:37.042
Gordon had finished by now
and opened another restaurant.
Nice cornering!

30:37.042 --> 30:39.492
That's neat as well.

30:39.492 --> 30:42.393
And across the line...

30:50.822 --> 30:56.242
So...you wanted to beat Gordon
Ramsay... Yes, please...who's here.

30:56.242 --> 31:01.252
Please Gordon, you've got
your Michelin star, this is mine.

31:01.252 --> 31:07.192
He's got more than one Michelin
star. OK, he's got several.

31:07.192 --> 31:10.762
Jamie Oliver,
you have to beat one minute 50.

31:10.762 --> 31:15.756
Yeah.
You did it in one minute...fifty...

31:17.192 --> 31:19.205
..seconds. YES!

31:32.902 --> 31:35.132
CHEERING

31:40.642 --> 31:45.072
You needn't think
it'll look like that next week.

31:45.072 --> 31:48.112
Have a bottle of Babycham.
Thanks.

31:48.112 --> 31:54.752
Thank you for coming.
You have been brilliant. Ladies
and gentlemen - Jamie Oliver!

31:54.752 --> 31:56.936
That's great!

32:08.382 --> 32:13.712
Right, this is THE performance car
yardstick. It's the BMW M3.

32:13.712 --> 32:20.532
You can use it every day,
OR take it to a track.
It'll set your trousers on fire.

32:20.532 --> 32:26.192
Couple of things to know. Avoid the
sequential gearbox which is rubbish

32:26.192 --> 32:31.572
and ruins the whole thing. Another
thing to avoid. Want to guess?

32:31.572 --> 32:34.351
CROWD: The colour! Colour. I mean...

32:34.351 --> 32:40.412
I won't have the red, blue or black
one, I'll have bile yellow!

32:40.412 --> 32:44.041
AUDIENCE LAUGHS
So, avoid that and the gearbox,

32:44.041 --> 32:48.171
and really, you can't do better.
Or can you?

32:51.351 --> 32:54.231
This is the new Audi S4.

32:54.231 --> 32:59.817
It doesn't look like much, but
they've put a V8 under the bonnet.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.031
A big one.

33:03.031 --> 33:05.522
4.2 litres.

33:08.412 --> 33:12.622
They've given it more doors
than the BMW and more grip,

33:12.622 --> 33:14.738
in the shape of four-wheel drive.

33:16.772 --> 33:22.620
Then, there's the price. At £36,000,
it's £3,000 LESS than the M3.

33:27.812 --> 33:33.662
So, this is Audi's lump hammer,
built to break BMW's nut.

33:33.662 --> 33:35.675
ENGINES REV

33:38.092 --> 33:40.281
So, has it worked?

33:40.281 --> 33:42.476
TYRES SCREECH

33:47.721 --> 33:49.211
ENGINE ROARS

33:52.071 --> 33:55.721
Amazingly,
despite all Audi's hard work,

33:55.721 --> 33:58.711
in a simple race down our runway,

33:58.711 --> 34:00.929
this was the result...

34:02.641 --> 34:07.001
You see,
although the Audi has 1,000 more cc

34:07.001 --> 34:09.101
and two more cylinders,

34:09.101 --> 34:12.431
it only develops
one more brake horsepower.

34:12.431 --> 34:16.822
But what happens
when the road gets twisty?

34:16.822 --> 34:19.598
TYRES SQUEAL

34:25.181 --> 34:31.803
Being four-wheel drive, the Audi
is the opposite of a barbecue -
it's better when wet.

34:33.452 --> 34:36.081
But it's also very good in the dry.

34:36.081 --> 34:38.542
The handling

34:38.542 --> 34:41.112
is ABSOLUTELY sublime.

34:42.661 --> 34:45.391
This is harnessed lunacy.

34:48.071 --> 34:54.010
But I still don't think
it's as much fun as the unhinged M3.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.801
That's the thing about the Audi.

34:58.801 --> 35:02.692
The engine is a masterpiece.
It really is.

35:04.921 --> 35:08.542
And it's beautifully made
and very safe.

35:08.542 --> 35:11.382
But in terms of sheer entertainment,

35:11.382 --> 35:13.921
it's like a dinner party -

35:13.921 --> 35:19.689
civilised conversation, glass of
wine, a bit of Sade on the stereo.

35:27.641 --> 35:30.612
Now the BMW, on the other hand,

35:30.612 --> 35:34.582
that's more like
a 2am Ibiza beach barbecue.

35:34.582 --> 35:37.540
TYRES SCREECH

36:05.092 --> 36:08.542
So, there you have it.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.225
The yob...

36:12.652 --> 36:15.382
.. and the provincial solicitor.

36:26.351 --> 36:30.942
The Audi is better value,
more practical and more grown-up.

36:30.942 --> 36:35.892
The BMW is more of a hoot and,
in a straight line, quicker.

36:35.892 --> 36:38.942
But we do have one more test
to do -

36:38.942 --> 36:43.191
to see which is the fastest
round our tracks.

36:43.191 --> 36:45.822
That means breaking out The Stig.

36:45.822 --> 36:52.382
That's a problem - he's been
to Nashville and developed
a penchant for Country & Western.

36:52.382 --> 36:54.751
Yee-ha!
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

36:54.751 --> 37:00.751
Right, first up, the BMW. 343 HP,
rear-wheel drive, 160kg lighter

37:00.751 --> 37:04.391
than the Audi.
Not much can keep up with this.

37:04.391 --> 37:11.391
It's VERY tidy
through the hammerhead and...
Woah-ho - that's seriously quick!

37:11.391 --> 37:16.652
The S4 will need to be pretty
special to get close to this.

37:16.652 --> 37:21.281
Here is the Audi. Four-wheel drive.
What is The Stig listening to?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.057
COUNTRY & WESTERN MUSIC PLayS

37:28.951 --> 37:32.452
Looking good so far.
Little bit of understeer,

37:32.452 --> 37:36.111
but that's not really
slowed him down.

37:36.111 --> 37:41.942
It's the hammerhead. It's THE test
for heavy cars - will it run wide?

37:41.942 --> 37:45.391
No, he's kept it in check. God...

37:45.391 --> 37:49.892
As he blasts
into the follow-through...

37:49.892 --> 37:55.942
A seriously quick car -
fantastic V8 engine,
almost as good as the BMW's.

37:55.942 --> 37:59.551
One more corner...
He's running very wide.

37:59.551 --> 38:02.391
And it's across the line in...

38:02.391 --> 38:08.751
Actually, we'll have to do
the BMW time first.
That did it in one minute 31. 8 -

38:08.751 --> 38:11.471
quicker than an Esprit V8.

38:11.471 --> 38:17.471
However, the Audi S4, which we know
is slower in a straight line,

38:17.471 --> 38:23.551
did it in one minute 30. 9 -
nearly a second quicker!

38:23.551 --> 38:27.791
Just off the Murcielago!
What about in the wet?

38:27.791 --> 38:34.252
It's funny you should mention that.
I was talking to a racing driver
who'd been out in a Lister Storm,

38:34.252 --> 38:41.252
in a race, and it poured with rain.
They sent out the safety car,
which was an Audi RS4.

38:41.252 --> 38:48.151
It was going round to bunch them
all up, and the bloke in the Lister
Storm got on the car-to-pit radio

38:48.151 --> 38:54.951
and said, "Slow him down,
I can't keep up! " They're very good
in the wet AND dry.

38:54.951 --> 38:57.911
So what will you have, Jeremy?

38:57.911 --> 39:03.291
For one lap of a track the M3 is
the one I'd choose, but every day...

39:03.291 --> 39:05.555
The Audi. The Audi.

39:07.311 --> 39:14.311
It's time to sort the big political
issue. That's not foundation
hospitals or Clare Short,

39:14.311 --> 39:18.061
but which is the fastest
political party?

39:18.061 --> 39:20.751
First up, the Tories.

39:20.751 --> 39:26.751
I'm gonna set your music going.
Good luck, take care. Thank you.

39:26.751 --> 39:29.011
Go!

from the Tories, but he could
still lose his deposit.

39:56.091 --> 40:00.781
Iain Duncan Smith is going to send
a letter to Greg Dyke,

40:00.781 --> 40:05.871
complaining that the BBC is biased
against the Tory party.

40:05.871 --> 40:10.291
The BBC is taking this very
seriously, and so are we!

40:10.291 --> 40:15.571
We saw Bernard Jenkin go round our
dry test track and set his time.

40:15.571 --> 40:21.157
Then we made the other candidates
wait a little bit... until this.

40:26.011 --> 40:32.871

43:10.721 --> 43:18.801
