00:05.380 --> 00:08.257
- Oh, hey! How was your audition?
- Hey.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.260
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:12.762 --> 00:13.804
What are you doing?

00:13.972 --> 00:16.724
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

00:16.891 --> 00:18.892
Oh, you got it?

00:19.060 --> 00:22.646
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

00:22.814 --> 00:26.442
A big-budget period movie about
three Italian brothers...

00:26.609 --> 00:30.320
...who come to America at the turn
of the century. It's classy.

00:30.488 --> 00:34.783
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.911
The "next-next"?

00:38.079 --> 00:41.915
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.209
This guy's right after him.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.630
Hello?

00:48.798 --> 00:54.636
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

00:54.804 --> 00:55.888
They loved me!

00:57.140 --> 00:59.641
They want to see you again tomorrow.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.935
- Oh, my God.
- Just one thing.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.814
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

01:07.692 --> 01:11.403
Are you kidding me?
I never rent a movie without it!

01:12.280 --> 01:13.947
Oh.

01:14.449 --> 01:18.118
Uh, okay, let me call you back.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.997
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.457
- Wow.
- I know.

01:23.625 --> 01:28.754
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.382
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

02:13.550 --> 02:16.510
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.805
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.683
A "no sex" pact, huh?

02:23.351 --> 02:26.979
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.317
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

02:32.485 --> 02:34.945
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.490
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.827
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.454
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

02:44.622 --> 02:46.165
You're probably right.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.418
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.587
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

02:51.754 --> 02:53.088
Yeah.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.340
Subtle, guys.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.176
What?

02:57.343 --> 03:01.263
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.393
Ha, okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.645
- Okay. Sorry.
- Okay.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.191
Oh, my God.
We have to throw her a shower?

03:17.697 --> 03:20.199
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.743
I don't know.

03:23.119 --> 03:27.164
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.750
Nudity's really important
to the story.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.085
That's what you say about porn.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.339
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

03:35.506 --> 03:39.635
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.304
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

03:42.972 --> 03:48.227
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.480
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.316
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.028
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.240
It's really sweet and tender.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.991
Plus, everyone is gonna
see your thing.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.539
When can we have this shower?

04:09.707 --> 04:13.001
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.046
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.382
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.844
Well, if we make it yesterday,
woo-hoo, we're done.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.639
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.350
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.811
There's too much to do.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.438
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

04:33.606 --> 04:36.858
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.527
Just calm down, woman!

04:41.197 --> 04:43.240
Phoebe, I already did.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.826
- All right, then I need to calm down.
- Okay.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.621
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.707
- Uh-huh.
- We have two days to plan this party.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.668
- We just need to make fast decisions.
- Mm-hm.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.211
Where will we have it?

04:56.379 --> 04:59.298
- Um, here. What time?
- Four o'clock. Food?

04:59.507 --> 05:02.759
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Ooh, great. Very Monica.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.262
- And chili.
- Ah, you went one too far.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.849
- Uh, flowers or balloons?
- Both.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.143
- We're paying for this. Okay.
- Neither.

05:11.311 --> 05:17.024
- Um, what should we do for the theme?
- "Lusts of the Flesh."

05:18.234 --> 05:21.570
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.495
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.998
Oh, boy. Me too.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.751
You know, I was thinking,
if we had a big fight...

05:35.918 --> 05:38.211
- Mm-hm.
...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.

05:38.379 --> 05:42.090
- Yeah.
- Technically, we could have sex again.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.136
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.972
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.474
- That's me. Come on.
- Okay.

05:50.641 --> 05:54.144
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.438
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

05:57.440 --> 05:59.900
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.447
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.201
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.912
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.641
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.646
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.483
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.194
Chandler, she's our cousin!

06:44.362 --> 06:47.406
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.076
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.869
Say something.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.331
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.543
Fine. She can stay at my place.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.003
What does Cassie look like now?

07:02.171 --> 07:04.714
- She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
- Huh.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.843
So this Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.928
Wafer-thin ice.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.643
Hey, I'm back.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.894
Hi, Joey.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.148
Uh, so, will I be reading
the same scene again?

07:21.315 --> 07:24.151
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.486
Oh, great.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.781
I'd have been perfect for this part.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.493
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

07:33.661 --> 07:38.540
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.128
And scene.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.382
Huh? Wasn't that fun?

07:47.550 --> 07:50.886
We did a little improv there. Yeah!

07:51.053 --> 07:52.762
So, you... You were saying?

07:52.930 --> 07:55.599
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.934
Wow. Sure. That's great.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.395
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.523
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.276
And that barn is not too cold.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.615
Terrific.
Well, uh, there's one more thing.

08:11.782 --> 08:17.037
Uh... Uh, it's important to the director
that everything in the movie is authentic.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.540
In your love scene with Sarah...

08:20.708 --> 08:24.878
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.087
So...

08:29.008 --> 08:30.884
So, what?

08:31.052 --> 08:35.847
So, uh, well, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

08:36.015 --> 08:39.893
...be authentically, uh, anatomically...

08:40.061 --> 08:42.812
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.397
Yes!

08:45.024 --> 08:46.900
No. What?

08:48.903 --> 08:53.365
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

08:53.533 --> 08:54.783
Bar mitzvah-ed?

08:59.997 --> 09:02.666
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.875
- But you are?
- Yep.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.545
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.130
Wow. Wow.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.551
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

09:16.931 --> 09:20.642
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

09:20.810 --> 09:25.063
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.899
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.235
You figure out how to do it later.

09:30.403 --> 09:36.575
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning to...

09:36.742 --> 09:38.827
...grow a turtleneck.

09:44.041 --> 09:50.088
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

09:50.256 --> 09:53.758
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.595
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

09:57.221 --> 10:00.807
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.727
Unless...

10:05.563 --> 10:06.605
Unless what?

10:06.772 --> 10:11.026
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

10:11.193 --> 10:12.402
...fashion.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.576
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet, but, um...

10:19.744 --> 10:22.120
...off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

10:22.288 --> 10:26.791
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.469
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.473
We get mahogany boxes and
carve everyone's names in them.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.226
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.190
Okay. Okay.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.109
- All right, you take care of that.
- Okay.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.823
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

10:58.991 --> 11:03.620
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.458
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

11:08.626 --> 11:12.337
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.339
Have at it.

11:15.299 --> 11:19.469
All right. Turkey?
Mm, that won't work.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.138
Cheese? That won't work.

11:22.306 --> 11:26.059
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.771
Are you making him a sandwich?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.441
No, it's, um, more like a wrap.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.862
Okay, so, um, I'm gonna go, guys.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.741
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

11:45.788 --> 11:48.289
We have to get her a present?

11:49.041 --> 11:52.210
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.504
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.339
Ah.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.760
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

12:00.928 --> 12:03.430
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.265
Oh, nice.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.316
Cassie?

12:15.526 --> 12:18.027
- Hey, Ross.
- Hi. Ha, ha.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.780
It's been so long!

12:21.615 --> 12:23.241
Last time I saw you...

12:23.409 --> 12:27.078
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.580
Oh, uh, that's right.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.293
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

12:34.670 --> 12:38.214
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

12:38.382 --> 12:42.427
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.055
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.807
Oh.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.456
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.000
Uh-huh.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.129
Yeah, I have a knack for impressions.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.424
Well, maybe after we get re-acquainted,
uh, you could do me.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.551
Yeah. No!

13:32.645 --> 13:36.105
Cassie, how you...?
How you doing on that...

13:36.273 --> 13:37.982
...hot dog?

13:40.319 --> 13:43.530
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.619
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.996
Oh, right, right.
Ooh, remember the time...

13:52.164 --> 13:55.667
...l, uh, pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

13:57.461 --> 14:00.421
We're probably too old to do that now.

14:02.800 --> 14:07.637
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.347
Uh-huh, Uh-huh.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.475
And... And I'll always remember
that summer...

14:12.643 --> 14:17.480
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.649
It took you that long
to figure it out, huh?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.192
Um, I'm a little slow.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.614
Just as our children would be.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.789
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.500
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.587
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you. So nice to see you.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.673
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

14:43.841 --> 14:46.718
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

14:47.219 --> 14:50.013
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.725
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.520
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.442
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.735
How do you know Monica?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.487
- I was her accountant four years ago.
- Oh...

15:06.655 --> 15:10.867
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.370
That's great.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.500
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.170
Excuse us.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.175
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.220
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

15:31.388 --> 15:35.516
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

15:41.857 --> 15:46.694
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.905
Wow, those look great.

15:49.073 --> 15:53.910
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
Uh, this one is made of bologna.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.871
- And... And the toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.414
Thank God.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.294
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.798
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.509
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.428
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

16:13.305 --> 16:18.142
I also did a little something in fur,
but, uh, that's really just for me.

16:20.896 --> 16:25.358
Why don't you try these on?
We'll get a better idea of what works.

16:25.526 --> 16:29.070
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

16:35.953 --> 16:36.995
Ow.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.414
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.126
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.378
- And?
- Delicious.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.922
Joey.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.426
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

16:51.593 --> 16:52.927
What? Which one?

16:54.221 --> 16:56.973
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

17:07.401 --> 17:12.739
She's your cousin. She's your cousin.

17:12.906 --> 17:18.411
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

17:24.376 --> 17:28.421
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

17:28.589 --> 17:33.509
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.721
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.558
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logan's Run...

17:40.726 --> 17:43.728
...the sexiest movie ever.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.192
I know that look.

17:49.359 --> 17:53.738
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.948
I'm going in.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.959
What the hell are you doing?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.880
Say something clever.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.134
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

18:15.302 --> 18:19.222
Just has to be words. Say some words.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.184
Any words will do.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.396
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

18:27.564 --> 18:32.527
...that anyone has not talked ever!

18:33.946 --> 18:36.572
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

18:36.740 --> 18:40.451
...so just say something!

18:42.204 --> 18:46.040
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.380
Yeah, you really
shouldn't have said anything.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.343
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.806
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.310
Oh.

19:06.478 --> 19:10.273
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

19:10.440 --> 19:14.318
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.946
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.867
You already had it?

19:21.034 --> 19:24.370
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.915
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

19:28.750 --> 19:33.087
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.173
Now you don't have either.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.799
- We ruined everything.
- Ugh.

19:36.967 --> 19:41.804
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.474
- It kind of works out for the best, heh.
- What do you mean?

19:45.642 --> 19:50.229
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

19:50.397 --> 19:55.234
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

20:01.116 --> 20:03.826
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.835
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

20:13.003 --> 20:15.838
- Yeah.
- My whole family's from Naples.

20:16.006 --> 20:21.260
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

20:21.428 --> 20:23.930
We just need to, uh...

20:24.598 --> 20:26.015
Leslie?

20:26.183 --> 20:30.269
- Uh, Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Oh, hey, right. Not a problem.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.189
I totally understand you need to...

20:33.357 --> 20:36.984
...make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.527
Don't you worry.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.656
I have nothing to hide.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.910
So, there you go. That's me.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.704
One hundred-percent natural.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.640
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.482
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

21:16.650 --> 21:19.443
Yeah. Thank you so much
for letting me stay here.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.821
Oh, it's no problem. I've...

21:40.007 --> 21:41.048
What?

21:41.633 --> 21:44.385
Say something. Say anything.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.430
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
