16:10.302 --> 16:12.888
Ugh. Man, quit being a creep, Din.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.100
[beatboxing] Huh?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.268
Oh yeah, sure, I'll dance with you.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.355
Say, you look kind of familiar.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.193
I got you a present. You still like kites?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.570
What am I saying?
Of course she still likes kites.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.782
Okay, just… calm down.

16:32.950 --> 16:33.867
Be honest.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.204
Hey, Li Na. Happy birthday.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.039
I just want to say,

16:39.123 --> 16:41.834
-it's been a long time and…
-[fabric fraying]

16:42.793 --> 16:44.044
…I miss you.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.004
What?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.880
-[gasps] Oh no!
-[fabric rips]

16:46.964 --> 16:47.965
Oh, gosh. Um…

16:48.048 --> 16:50.050
-Hold on, I can fix this.
-[rips]

16:50.134 --> 16:51.343
Oh, come on.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.845
Wha--

16:52.928 --> 16:53.929
[exhales sadly]

17:03.022 --> 17:04.273
What was I thinking?

17:07.317 --> 17:08.152
No, no, no!

17:08.235 --> 17:09.236
Ah…

17:09.319 --> 17:11.321
[melancholy music plays]

17:21.498 --> 17:23.083
I must look totally crazy.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.210
It's just…

17:26.211 --> 17:27.921
I don't know what else to do.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.759
I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

17:31.842 --> 17:36.096
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

17:36.180 --> 17:41.060
but the whole time
it feels like something is missing.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.690
I just wish…

17:49.485 --> 17:52.446
I just wish I could keep our promise.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.742
[kettle whistling]

17:56.825 --> 17:57.701
Tea is ready.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.287
Wait, what? The tea is ready?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.289
[whistling]

18:02.873 --> 18:04.875
-Huh?
-[explosion]

18:06.627 --> 18:08.670
Well, that was…

18:08.754 --> 18:09.630
[loud boom]

18:09.713 --> 18:11.340
[whooshing]

18:11.423 --> 18:13.634
[male voice] Greetings, great master!

18:13.717 --> 18:17.638
The heavens have opened,
your wishes will be granted,

18:17.721 --> 18:22.643
for I am LongZhu! [echoing]

18:22.726 --> 18:23.811
Huh?

18:26.897 --> 18:30.901
Oh, a peasant boy.
Well, this'll be easy. [chuckles]

18:31.485 --> 18:33.529
Look, I know what you're thinking.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.197
"Do my eyes deceive me?"

18:35.280 --> 18:38.659
"A super, all-powerful,
magical Wish Dragon!"

18:38.742 --> 18:41.453
"Could this be real? Is magic real?"

18:42.412 --> 18:43.247
Yes.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.706
It's real.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.336
Now that we got that out of the way,
onto the important part.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.298
Am I… am I dead?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.175
Grandma! It's Din!

18:55.259 --> 18:58.345
-I fell off the roof. I'm coming for you!
-No, no.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.055
No, you're very much alive.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.474
I am a magical Wish Dragon,

19:02.558 --> 19:05.853
who will grant three wishes
to the owner of this teapot.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.355
And you, sir, are my master!

19:08.438 --> 19:10.357
So, go ahead, wish away!

19:12.734 --> 19:16.071
Okay, you got me.
Where are the hidden cameras?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.990
-Great joke, guys.
-Joke?

19:18.073 --> 19:21.577
-Is this a hologram or something?
-I assure you not.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.829
-[dramatic music rises]
-[Din] Ah!

19:23.912 --> 19:27.457
Do you wish for
a suit of armor made of solid gold?

19:27.541 --> 19:28.792
It shall be so.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.879
Do you wish
for the strength of 1,000 men? Boom!

19:31.962 --> 19:34.047
-It shall be so.
-Whoa.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.508
For the finest carriage in all the land?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.926
Pow! It's yours!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.761
The wings of a hawk!

19:39.845 --> 19:41.013
[caws]

19:41.096 --> 19:44.183
Or the legs of a giraffe.
Feels good up here, right?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.350
Or anything else

19:46.977 --> 19:49.021
that your heart desires.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.109
I'm thinking about starting one of those--

19:54.193 --> 19:56.612
Where they sell animals. Pet-type stores.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.531
You going to sell Chow Chows?
That's a good dog.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.327
No one will be selling anything
if we don't find that teapot.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.622
Every time I try
to make casual conversation,

20:06.705 --> 20:08.415
you guys give me a hard time.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.541
Wha--

20:12.252 --> 20:14.463
So, you're a Wish Dragon?

20:14.546 --> 20:15.422
Yes.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.716
How many wishes do I get?

20:17.799 --> 20:19.301
You get three wishes.

20:21.887 --> 20:26.099
-How do you fit in this teapot?
-Uh, it's magic. It's a magic teapot.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.935
So small. How old are you?

20:28.018 --> 20:30.145
-That's not--
-Where'd you come from?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.439
-All you need--
-Look at your arms.

20:32.522 --> 20:36.360
Why are you pink? Shouldn't you be green?
Your face is so soft. I want to touch it.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.737
Oh, can you breathe fire? [splutters]

20:42.032 --> 20:43.617
Okay. Look, peasant boy.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.663
I don't have time.
I'm not here to be your friend--

20:47.746 --> 20:50.082
Whoa, you have to earn my friendship,

20:50.165 --> 20:52.542
and frankly you're not doing a good job.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.586
Listen carefully.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.005
Every Wish Dragon must serve 10 masters

20:57.089 --> 21:00.050
before they're free
to enter the spirit world.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.511
And you are the last one.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.929
Now, I've been stuck…

21:04.012 --> 21:07.557
[high-pitched]
…in this teapot for 1,000 years.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.269
The sooner we get this over with,
the better.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.479
[normally] Have I made myself clear?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.189
[footsteps]

21:14.273 --> 21:15.732
Ha! [grunts]

21:16.942 --> 21:17.776
Wha--

21:20.070 --> 21:23.782
I'm terribly sorry, young man,
but I need that teapot.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.785
Uh, I-- I think it's his.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.329
Only the owner of the teapot can see me.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.875
Well, I'm sure he won't miss it.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.380
No way. I found it. Whoa!

21:38.463 --> 21:41.758
[yelling, grunting]

21:42.718 --> 21:44.720
[dramatic music plays]

21:48.473 --> 21:49.933
[panting]

21:57.441 --> 21:58.442
Not good.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
I wish I knew how to fight. [grunts]

22:02.070 --> 22:03.447
[henchmen chuckling]

22:05.449 --> 22:06.283
Come here.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.369
That's a good teapot.

22:14.916 --> 22:15.792
Huh?

22:15.876 --> 22:16.710
Huh?

22:20.422 --> 22:24.134
[henchman groaning
in distorted, slowed-down speed]

22:24.217 --> 22:25.218
[Din] Whoa.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.596
What the…

22:28.221 --> 22:30.349
[henchmen grunting]

22:32.768 --> 22:35.187
[gasps] No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.480
I take it back.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.315
Gimme that.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.443
Teapot.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.489
Give me that teapot right now.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.660
Huh? Oh!

22:55.874 --> 22:58.210
Whoa, I just kicked through a door!

22:58.293 --> 22:59.294
[Din yelps]

23:02.172 --> 23:03.757
Gimme! Gimme! Mine! Mine!

23:07.427 --> 23:08.261
[groans]

23:12.015 --> 23:13.308
You little twerp!

23:20.524 --> 23:21.858
-[menacing music]
-Ah!

23:23.777 --> 23:24.861
[knocking at door]

23:25.362 --> 23:27.406
Uh… nobody's home?

23:32.327 --> 23:35.747
I'm done asking nicely.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.346
[Din yelps]

23:54.349 --> 23:58.353
Are you telling me a teenage boy
out-fought two full-grown men?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.730
-Well, sir--
-Actually, three men.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.732
-Two-and-a-half.
-You should have seen him.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.735
It was 1,000 punches a minute.
Kicks everywhere.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.613
I've never seen so many arms and legs.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.323
[sighs] This is not good.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.701
The boy knows what he has.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.162
Sir, if I may ask,

24:15.245 --> 24:17.038
what exactly does he have?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.917
That's none of your business.
I'm paying you to find it.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.670
-That is your only concern.
-You haven't paid.

24:23.753 --> 24:27.632
You'll be paid when I have the teapot,
beyond your wildest dreams!

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
Do you understand?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.553
Forgive our incompetence, sir.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.431
But the boy did leave something behind.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.434
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.353
[snoring]

24:41.771 --> 24:42.856
[snoring, gasping]

24:44.065 --> 24:45.150
Din, up now!

24:45.233 --> 24:48.778
-[groggily] How about a kick to the face?
-Huh? I said up!

24:48.862 --> 24:50.071
[yelps, exclaims]

24:52.282 --> 24:54.743
-Ow.
-Breakfast is on the table.

24:55.952 --> 24:56.828
Thanks, Mom.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.789
What a crazy dream.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.544
[distorted, slowed-down audio]

25:10.050 --> 25:11.218
[Din groans]

25:11.301 --> 25:13.595
Din, I'm working late tonight.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.143
So, leftovers for dinner, okay?

25:21.603 --> 25:22.604
[Din] Mmm!

25:23.813 --> 25:24.731
Delicious.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.568
So, leftovers for dinner.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.070
Yeah.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.322
Leftovers.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.409
[Din's mom] Aiya.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.746
Stupid shoes.

25:41.623 --> 25:45.502
Hey Mom, if you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

25:46.086 --> 25:49.130
Din, why are you
asking silly questions? Eat.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.049
Okay, but seriously, Mom,

25:51.132 --> 25:53.426
if you could wish for anything.

25:53.510 --> 25:57.472
-A big house in the countryside?
-Din, we went over this yesterday.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.267
I want you to focus on your future.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.768
That is what I wish for.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.732
I'm more focused
than I've ever been in my entire life.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.027
Hmm. Good.
Now hurry up. You're gonna be late.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.949
-What's that face? I know that.
-I don't have a face. What?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.577
Go to school. Stop planning things.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.706
[dramatic music plays]

26:28.336 --> 26:30.130
Um, hello?

26:30.213 --> 26:31.381
Dragon thingy?

26:31.464 --> 26:32.549
You in there?

26:33.216 --> 26:34.676
[crying out]

26:35.343 --> 26:37.012
Excellent work, peasant boy.

26:37.095 --> 26:40.265
One wish down, two to go.
We could be done by lunch.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.434
What did you do to me?
Why do I know kung fu?

26:42.517 --> 26:46.187
You're welcome. You wish you could fight.
I made you a master.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.732
I didn't wish for… Hey, that's not fair.

26:48.815 --> 26:49.941
You said "wish."

26:50.025 --> 26:54.654
Oh, so just 'cause I said "wish,"
now I'm stuck with these kung fu powers?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.406
-[grunts]
-Cool.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.325
Yes, it's all very cool.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.410
So, onto that second wish.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.829
Let me recommend the all-time favorite.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.415
A giant pile of gold!

27:05.498 --> 27:08.835
Now, repeat after me.
"I wish for…" You're not talking.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.630
"A giant pile of…"
You're not saying anything.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.214
Hey, stop rushing me.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.802
Ah, you must be the conquering type.
I see that killer instinct in your eyes.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.306
Easy. Just wish for
your very own personal army!

27:22.390 --> 27:23.892
Why would I need an army?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.353
You're quite a simple fellow.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.189
Not to worry.
Here's one the peasant-folk love.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.357
[yelping]

27:30.440 --> 27:33.109
I can allow you to speak with a loved one

27:33.193 --> 27:35.195
on the other side of China!

27:35.695 --> 27:39.074
I'm a loved one.
I can't hear you. You're very far away.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.161
-There's a wall here. It's cool, but--
-You mean, like, a cell phone?

27:43.244 --> 27:44.788
-[ringtone plays]
-Ah!

27:45.372 --> 27:46.956
What dark magic is this?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.792
Where is the tiny orchestra?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.127
How do they fit in this metal box?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.755
Two wishes. Anything I want.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.591
[gasps] The birthday party.
I know what I want.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.718
Wait, a wish?

27:58.802 --> 28:00.053
Yeah, yeah, a wish.

28:00.762 --> 28:01.888
Excellent.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.140
[bright, upbeat music plays]

28:04.224 --> 28:05.058
Ah!

28:05.892 --> 28:08.895
-[cars honk]
-[plane whooshes]

28:09.938 --> 28:11.606
A giant metal bird?

28:12.941 --> 28:16.861
-What are you doing?
-Uh, riding my magical Wish Dragon. Away!

28:18.822 --> 28:20.031
What are you doing?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.951
If you're not gonna let me ride you,
we catch the bus.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.286
The "bus"?
Is that some kind of animal?

28:25.370 --> 28:29.582
-How long have you been in that teapot?
-Is it still the Qing Dynasty?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.167
-Ooh!
-Long!

28:31.918 --> 28:33.461
How did you get in there?

28:34.087 --> 28:36.631
Don't ignore me when I'm talking, peasant.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.050
It's not a little man. It's television.

28:40.051 --> 28:40.969
What's this?

28:42.095 --> 28:43.096
[Din] Car.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.724
Ah, the spoils of war on display?

28:47.016 --> 28:49.728
-What is this invisible force--
-[Din] Glass!

28:50.270 --> 28:51.896
-What purpose--
-Stop light.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.940
-What in the world?
-Ice cream.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.650
-How is this--
-Electricity.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.027
-I know it's all amazing--
-Amazing?

28:58.111 --> 29:00.530
When you've been around
as long as I have,

29:00.613 --> 29:03.491
there's nothing in this world
that could amaze--

29:04.075 --> 29:05.994
"Shrimp chips."

29:06.077 --> 29:07.454
Peasant food, no doubt.

29:07.537 --> 29:10.081
[chewing loudly]

29:10.582 --> 29:11.791
[gasps]

29:11.875 --> 29:13.460
Magnificent!

29:14.836 --> 29:16.629
Okay, we're here.

29:16.713 --> 29:20.717
-You gonna make a wish now?
-I will. Just wait until we get there.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.218
-Get where?
-[horn honks]

29:22.302 --> 29:24.095
Great Wall of China!

29:25.096 --> 29:27.474
A giant chariot made of steel and glass!

29:27.557 --> 29:29.267
Long, this is bus. Come on.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.935
-Out of the way.
-My word!

29:32.479 --> 29:33.563
[chicken clucking]

29:33.646 --> 29:37.066
-And watch your step. Carefully.
-Thank you, kind sir.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.318
[Din grunting]

29:39.444 --> 29:42.655
-No. There must be a better…
-Long, what are you doing?

29:44.032 --> 29:44.949
[Long] Ah!

29:45.033 --> 29:46.367
That's more like it.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.995
Long, what are you doing?

29:49.078 --> 29:50.789
Getting a personal carriage.

29:50.872 --> 29:55.418
I can't afford a personal carriage,
which is why we were taking the bus.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.170
Did you just steal my money?

29:58.046 --> 30:00.173
-…we won't make the express.
-Here.

30:00.256 --> 30:03.426
-Hey, where did you get this?
-You know, magic.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.722
[chuckles]

30:07.806 --> 30:09.599
I, uh, had a really big lunch.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.315
This is more like it!

30:17.398 --> 30:19.275
[splutters, yelps]

30:20.276 --> 30:21.277
Huh?

30:22.570 --> 30:24.155
Uh, what is this?

30:24.239 --> 30:25.448
Traffic.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.407
Traffic.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.327
-That some kind of national holiday?
-Ha!

30:30.036 --> 30:35.667
You mean to tell me this happens
every single day?

30:36.709 --> 30:38.711
[horns honking]

30:39.462 --> 30:41.297
[Long groans]

30:41.381 --> 30:43.383
The sun is moving faster than us.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.345
This is worse than my teapot.

30:47.428 --> 30:52.141
Ugh! I'm never going to make it in time.
I wish this traffic would just--

30:52.225 --> 30:53.351
Yes, go ahead.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.979
Long, I'm not gonna
waste a wish on traffic!

30:56.062 --> 30:59.065
-Look, Din, you're gonna have to use--
-[honking]

30:59.148 --> 31:00.567
You're gonna have to--

31:00.650 --> 31:02.193
You're going to have to--

31:02.944 --> 31:05.154
-You're gonna have to use--
-[honks]

31:05.238 --> 31:06.072
Use a wish!

31:06.155 --> 31:09.617
You son of a cabbage farmer!
There is no place to go!

31:09.701 --> 31:13.913
Blow your trumpet all you want.
It won't make any difference at all!

31:13.997 --> 31:16.749
You know, Long,
we'll get there eventually.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.377
Even if it takes all day.

31:19.961 --> 31:20.962
All day?

31:21.045 --> 31:24.257
I heard one traffic jam
lasted three weeks. [sighs]

31:24.340 --> 31:27.343
If only I had
a magical dragon that could fly.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.554
I know what you're trying. Not gonna work.

31:29.637 --> 31:33.766
I spent 1,000 years in that teapot.
I can spend hours in your traffic.

31:33.850 --> 31:38.271
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we listen
to the tiny orchestra while we wait?

31:38.354 --> 31:39.772
[jaunty ring tone plays]

31:39.856 --> 31:41.065
Not gonna work, Din.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.151
[ring tone continues]

31:43.943 --> 31:45.236
Use your wish, Din.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.622
[indistinct chatter from TV]

31:56.706 --> 32:00.585
-[overlapping chatter]
-[honking]

32:04.756 --> 32:05.632
[Long] Fine!

32:06.341 --> 32:07.717
[Din] Ah!

32:08.343 --> 32:09.636
[yelping]

32:23.149 --> 32:25.068
Careful what you don't wish for.

32:25.151 --> 32:28.696
-Push me too far, I will not hesitate to--
-Fly everywhere?

32:28.780 --> 32:32.033
You're amazing! Look.
Is there anything you can't do?

32:32.909 --> 32:35.119
Well, that's very-- Ah!

32:35.203 --> 32:37.121
[plane whooshes]

32:37.205 --> 32:40.333
[chuckles awkwardly]
Anyways, where are we going?

32:40.416 --> 32:42.085
Ah, there it is! Down there.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.003
[energetic music plays]

32:44.087 --> 32:45.797
[Din cheering]

32:48.216 --> 32:49.300
We're here.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.135
-Wishing time.
-Ah!

32:51.719 --> 32:54.138
Excellent.
I see where this is going.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.600
Now, when choosing a palace,
it is very important that--

33:00.103 --> 33:01.688
Uh, what are you do--

33:01.771 --> 33:04.607
-[groans]
-Quit goofing off. This is serious.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.693
Okay, what's the wish?

33:06.776 --> 33:07.944
Okay, you see her?

33:08.027 --> 33:09.153
Hi, good evening.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.948
-Thank you for coming.
-Li Na, happy birthday.

33:12.031 --> 33:12.865
How are you?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.576
That's my second wish, Long.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.745
-I wish--
-Stop, stop, stop!

33:18.246 --> 33:21.207
-I can't do love.
-What? No, Long, it's not--

33:21.290 --> 33:24.252
Couple of rules.
I can't time travel, I can't kill,

33:24.335 --> 33:28.464
and it pains me to inform you, not really,
I can't make people fall in love with you.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.259
No, no, no, it's not like that, Long.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.844
She's my best friend.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.137
That's my wish.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.514
I want my friend back.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.937
Wait, rewind. You can wish
for anything in the whole world,

33:43.021 --> 33:44.731
and you waste it on a friend?

33:44.814 --> 33:47.191
What could be more important?

33:48.651 --> 33:51.195
-Is that a trick question?
-No.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.947
Literally anything else.

33:53.031 --> 33:57.285
Let me think, a golden chamber pot,
a palace made entirely of jade,

33:57.368 --> 34:01.664
an army of terracotta warriors!
Why are you wasting a wish on some girl?

34:02.749 --> 34:05.251
Oh! That's right.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.795
Sorry, I can't expect you to understand.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.715
I haven't explained everything.
Down, please.

34:12.759 --> 34:16.721
Ten years ago, a cool spring day.
A gentle breeze.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.099
A lonely boy waits after school. Me.

34:20.183 --> 34:24.645
Enter the girl, Li Na, throwing dumplings
and defending my honor. Then we…

34:24.729 --> 34:28.066
[Long] This is really happening.
This should be so easy.

34:28.149 --> 34:32.820
Three wishes and I'm done.
But no, I get stuck with this simpleton.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.406
Just look at him with his mindless grin.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.909
So naive. So ignorant.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.869
So stupid.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.454
Why?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.998
What have I done to deserve this?

34:44.082 --> 34:48.086
And then she drove away
and I never saw her again.

34:50.379 --> 34:54.050
It's okay, Long. I get emotional too
just talking about it.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.511
[groaning]

34:56.594 --> 35:01.015
I can't make people fall in love.
Why would I make someone your friend?

35:01.099 --> 35:05.103
What? No, she's already my friend.
I just need to get into the party.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.355
A wish! Why didn't you just say so?

35:07.438 --> 35:09.398
Yeah, I wish to be a princeling.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.819
All right, here we go.
Stand back and it shall be so!

35:12.902 --> 35:13.903
[whoosh, poof]

35:14.946 --> 35:17.740
Done and done. Now, onto that final wish.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.075
[neighs]

35:20.701 --> 35:21.702
What is this?

35:23.329 --> 35:25.206
What? I made you a prince.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.542
No, no, I said princeling.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.336
Like one of those guys
with the fancy suit,

35:30.419 --> 35:32.755
the Rolex watch
and the chauffeured car,

35:32.839 --> 35:35.258
-the personal assistant--
-[splutters]

35:35.341 --> 35:38.261
That's like ten different wishes.
You have two.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.764
Fine. How about a temporary version,
just for today?

35:41.848 --> 35:45.184
You're seriously going to wish
to be rich for 24 hours?

35:45.268 --> 35:46.727
I don't care about that.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.857
I just need to reconnect with Li Na.
She won't care if I'm poor.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.693
[laughs] I'm sorry I'm laughing,

35:53.776 --> 35:58.281
but that is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. Of course she'll care.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.409
Yeah, well, it's my wish and not yours.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.369
Shoot me with your magic juice.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.831
Fine, 24 hours.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.084
Perfect!

36:10.168 --> 36:11.586
And the car.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.839
Whoa.

36:14.922 --> 36:15.756
Perfect.

36:15.840 --> 36:20.511
And the personal assistant who has to do
everything I ask for the next 24 hours.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.180
[groans]

36:25.683 --> 36:29.604
Long, you look good as a human.
Now, walking can be tricky, but--

36:30.938 --> 36:32.565
Okay, party time.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.442
[tires screech]

36:40.990 --> 36:42.283
Oh, uh.

36:43.034 --> 36:47.288
[bald man] Good afternoon.
I'd like to inquire about a customer.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.790
[clerk] Sorry, I can't give out… [grunts]

36:55.671 --> 36:56.714
Follow me.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.596
[tires screech]

37:04.597 --> 37:08.851
[triumphant music plays]

37:12.063 --> 37:13.397
[all gasp]

37:13.481 --> 37:16.984
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Now, these are my kind of people.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.362
The servants' entrance is around back.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.783
[classical music plays]

37:24.408 --> 37:25.243
Whoa.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.245
This is amazing.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.372
Oh, you got in.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.875
-I've never been so humiliated in--
-Coat check, thank you.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.045
There she is.

37:36.712 --> 37:37.880
She looks so…

37:38.798 --> 37:39.757
important.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.677
-Li Na.
-It's so good to see you again.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.012
How does it feel to be 19, dear?

37:45.096 --> 37:48.975
Oh, well, I've actually been feeling
really confused lately--

37:49.058 --> 37:53.479
Great, dear. What would you say
about being the new face of Shin Makeup?

37:53.562 --> 37:57.108
Actually, I no longer rep products
that use animal testing.

37:57.191 --> 37:59.443
-Where's your father?
-Li Na?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.445
I'll have him sign the contract.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.990
-Li Na!
-It's so great to see you again!

38:04.073 --> 38:06.033
I want to talk about your future.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.202
I've been thinking about my future.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.248
Inflatable bras, the future of fashion.
I want you to be a part.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.667
-Yeah, I'm not sure--
-That's great!

38:14.750 --> 38:16.877
I'll have a shoot scheduled ASAP.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.089
-Happy birthday!
-It's so-- Oh, it's you, Buckley.

38:20.172 --> 38:23.175
We're halfway through the list.
You're doing great.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.720
Yeah, great. Any word from my dad?

38:25.803 --> 38:28.055
He's working hard, just like we are.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.641
So, how about a little bit less of this,

38:30.725 --> 38:32.059
and more of this!

38:32.143 --> 38:34.395
All right, Din. [exhales] Here we go.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.605
Got it. Game face.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.941
-Whoo. Here we go!
-Hi, Li Na! Happy--

38:39.025 --> 38:41.360
Hi, it's so great to see you again.

38:41.444 --> 38:46.198
-Oh, i feel that same way. So--
-This is just the greatest day of my life.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.950
Uh, wow, you too?

38:48.034 --> 38:51.537
Uh, wait, before I forget,
I brought you a little something.

38:51.620 --> 38:55.291
-Hi, it's so good to see you again.
-Actually, we never met.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.085
-If I may?
-Hi, it's so great to see you again.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.257
So, how's your best friend?

39:03.841 --> 39:05.760
I… I don't know what happened.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.595
She didn't even recognize me.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.473
Great. Dreams crushed.
We're done here, right?

39:10.556 --> 39:11.932
I'll have two to go.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.019
[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,
time for a treat.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.939
If we could have the birthday girl
and her father come to the dance floor…

39:19.023 --> 39:20.316
There she is.

39:20.399 --> 39:24.153
And now her father, Mr. Wang,
come to the stage.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.821
Calling Mr. Wang!

39:25.905 --> 39:28.366
-Come on, Dad. Don't be shy.
-Mr. Wang?

39:28.449 --> 39:30.451
Mr. Wang, come on down!

39:30.534 --> 39:33.037
I'm sure he'll be here any second.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.413
Mr. Wang.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.415
Wang? Do I have the right name?

39:36.499 --> 39:40.252
What kind of father doesn't show up
to his daughter's birthday?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.046
-[man 2] I know.
-Come on.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.424
-We gotta do something.
-[emcee] Mic was on. I apologize.

39:45.508 --> 39:49.387
[Din] Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention here.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.931
It's time for the entertainment portion.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.849
Long, make some smoke. Lights.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.851
[electronic music playing]

39:55.935 --> 40:00.523
[Din] From the streets of Shaolin,
kung fu like you've never seen it before.

40:00.606 --> 40:03.943
Introducing the great master!

40:04.026 --> 40:05.194
[whoosh]

40:05.277 --> 40:06.654
[crowd gasps, applauds]

40:06.737 --> 40:08.989
Trained in the art of Dragon Style.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.408
[crowd] Ooh!

40:19.417 --> 40:22.253
Now, everyone,
keep your eyes on the stage as I…

40:26.841 --> 40:28.175
[exclaiming]

40:30.261 --> 40:31.595
[applause, cheering]

40:37.226 --> 40:40.271
Uh, that's it.
Show's over. Thank you, folks. Bye!

40:40.354 --> 40:41.939
Personal assistant.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.816
Never been so insulted.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.401
Lucky number eight!

40:46.026 --> 40:49.488
Sir, caviar crème anglaise amuse-bouche?

40:49.572 --> 40:52.575
You don't have
any, uh, shrimp chips, do you?

40:52.658 --> 40:54.201
Uh, no.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.954
[mockingly] No. [hiccups]

40:57.580 --> 40:58.539
Oh, no.

40:58.622 --> 41:01.333
What's a man like you
doing all by himself?

41:02.585 --> 41:06.255
So true. Who needs wine
when you have good company?

41:06.338 --> 41:08.841
I believe you've misunder-- [hiccups]

41:08.924 --> 41:12.136
[laughs] I don't normally
move this fast, but…

41:13.471 --> 41:15.055
Sorry, must run.

41:16.098 --> 41:17.099
Hello…

41:19.018 --> 41:19.852
Li Na?

41:21.187 --> 41:23.314
Oh, handsome?

41:24.565 --> 41:26.567
Playing hard to get, I see.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.530
Water. Water. I just need water.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.616
[panting]

41:36.202 --> 41:37.203
[sighs in relief]

41:41.415 --> 41:42.291
Refreshing.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.133
[spluttering]

41:53.677 --> 41:54.720
Where's that kid?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.276
Hello?

42:10.152 --> 42:13.405
-Li Na, is that you?
-Go away. I'm busy.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.450
Ah, yeah, I can see you're busy.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.077
Yes, very busy.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.079
Okay, I… I just…

42:21.038 --> 42:24.708
I'm the one who did
that whole kung fu thing.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.086
I was just trying to…

42:29.588 --> 42:31.590
I know what you were trying to do.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.343
Thanks.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.558
[muffled crying]

42:41.517 --> 42:42.518
Are you okay?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.187
Yeah.

42:45.896 --> 42:46.772
I'm fine.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.857
[Li Na sobbing]

42:49.525 --> 42:51.068
Here, take this.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.528
Thank you.

42:52.611 --> 42:53.946
[Li Na blowing nose]

42:54.530 --> 42:55.614
[Li Na blows nose]

42:58.117 --> 43:02.663
Just… just one night
out of the whole year,

43:02.746 --> 43:05.708
I thought maybe he could make time.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.211
I don't know why I'm letting it get to me.

43:09.795 --> 43:10.879
I'm sorry.

43:11.422 --> 43:14.883
This is so embarrassing.
I don't normally cry like this.

43:19.722 --> 43:22.474
Here, you got a little something
on your face.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.564
Yeah, it's not really coming off.

43:29.940 --> 43:33.402
[gasps] I'm sorry.
I must look totally crazy.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.279
No, no.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.199
I just… don't know what else to do.

43:39.742 --> 43:44.288
It's like, I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

43:44.872 --> 43:48.542
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

43:48.626 --> 43:52.421
but… no matter how hard I try,
I just feel like…

43:53.547 --> 43:54.590
Like…

43:54.673 --> 43:56.425
[both] Something is missing.

43:58.802 --> 43:59.637
Exactly.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.139
[poignant music plays]

44:04.850 --> 44:06.852
[woman] There you are, snake eyes.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.981
I'm sorry, do I--

44:11.065 --> 44:12.608
Oh! Ah!

44:12.691 --> 44:14.485
Oh, jeez, are you okay?

44:14.985 --> 44:16.111
I'm fine.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.072
[both laugh]

44:18.155 --> 44:18.989
Here.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.700
Thanks.

44:23.202 --> 44:27.790
I'm sorry for being so rude.
I don't think I got your name earlier.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.709
Have we met before?

44:31.502 --> 44:34.171
Um, well, actually…

44:35.255 --> 44:36.382
I'm--

44:36.465 --> 44:39.176
There you are. Miss Wang, thank goodness.

44:39.259 --> 44:42.346
Just in time.
Your father will be here any second.

44:42.429 --> 44:44.556
-He made it?
-Uh, yes.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.351
[tablet chimes]

44:48.519 --> 44:50.145
Li Na! There you are.

44:50.229 --> 44:54.274
-Oh. Hi, Dad.
-Buckley informs me the party was perfect.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.985
Oh! Uh, yes, it was.

44:57.069 --> 44:59.279
-Thank you, Dad.
-You had a good time?

44:59.363 --> 45:02.366
Yes, of course.
I spoke to everyone you wanted me to

45:02.449 --> 45:07.162
and I think I was able to make
some really important… connections.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.666
Hello? Hello? Ah, there we go.

45:10.749 --> 45:13.210
Here, I brought you something special.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.629
-[clears throat]
-Oh! Uh…

45:15.713 --> 45:17.881
-Here you are.
-Go ahead. Open it!

45:17.965 --> 45:21.552
I had to send my assistant
to half the jewelers in Shanghai.

45:21.635 --> 45:22.594
It's true.

45:22.678 --> 45:26.390
-I know you appreciate something special.
-Oh, of course.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.892
Just as much as last year.

45:28.976 --> 45:29.935
Thank you, Dad.

45:30.018 --> 45:33.814
Oh, uh, did I?
Na Na, I'm sorry. You know, I--

45:33.897 --> 45:37.526
Well, you can never have too much
of a good thing, right?

45:37.609 --> 45:40.654
Excuse me,
I… I didn't see you there, young man.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.198
Allow me to get you a closer look, sir.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.117
Here you are.

45:45.826 --> 45:49.913
[Mr. Wang] Good quality leather,
excellent suit, Rolex.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.541
And what's the family business?

45:52.624 --> 45:54.668
Uh, dumplings!

45:54.752 --> 45:58.422
I mean, Dumpling House.
I mean, restaurants in general.

45:58.505 --> 45:59.339
All of them.

45:59.423 --> 46:02.885
Ah, a young man of means, I see.
Reminds me of myself.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.595
You two should have lunch.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.054
-Dad!
-Uh, yes.

46:06.138 --> 46:09.099
-Of course. I'd love that.
-Excellent.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.186
Let's have arrangements made.
Forgive my manners.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.687
I didn't get your name.

46:13.771 --> 46:14.938
Oh, I'm…

46:17.566 --> 46:19.568
-Dan.
-Pleasure to meet you, Dan.

46:19.651 --> 46:21.445
Where would you like to go?

46:21.528 --> 46:24.615
The Pearl Tower's excellent.
I have a reservation--

46:24.698 --> 46:29.995
-Excuse me, sir. A very important call.
-Just give me a few minutes.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.956
Sir, they said they need to talk now.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.125
[sighs] Put them on.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.420
Good evening, sorry to keep you waiting.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.466
So, um, would you really like to--

46:42.549 --> 46:44.760
Yes. Yeah. [chuckles]

46:45.469 --> 46:47.054
See you tomorrow, Dan.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.309
We talked and it was just like old times.

46:52.392 --> 46:55.354
We made arrangements
to have lunch. Can you believe it?

46:55.437 --> 46:57.773
I can't believe
you didn't explain what a toilet is.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.358
Everything is going to plan!

46:59.441 --> 47:01.485
Oh, really, Dan.

47:01.568 --> 47:04.863
Uh, I'll come clean when the time's right.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.783
You're not gonna,
because there is no right time.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.494
You're the peasant, she's the princess.

47:10.577 --> 47:13.539
Tale as old as time.
And we all know how that ends.

47:14.540 --> 47:17.501
-Good?
-No, not good. Terribly. Horribly!

47:17.584 --> 47:22.047
Long, we have a special bond
that runs deeper than money or status.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.173
Why'd you lie?

47:23.757 --> 47:25.092
Well, I… uh…

47:25.175 --> 47:26.176
I'll tell you.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.681
Because the minute Li Na finds out
who you are, this will all fall apart.

47:30.764 --> 47:33.517
You should learn
to have faith in humanity.

47:33.600 --> 47:37.646
I've been around for 1,000 years.
I know how humans work. Not you.

47:37.729 --> 47:40.899
-Poor Long. I see your problem.
-You're my problem.

47:40.983 --> 47:43.902
I wouldn't expect your tiny,
reptilian brain to understand

47:43.986 --> 47:45.696
the power of human friendship.

47:45.779 --> 47:49.283
It's okay. I'll be your first
and only friend. Come here.

47:49.366 --> 47:52.202
I had a million friends
when I was human. Oh, no.

47:54.079 --> 47:54.913
Long,

47:55.414 --> 47:57.708
-were you a--
-Yes, yes, I was human.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.961
For heaven's sake,
have you even looked at the teapot?

48:01.044 --> 48:03.672
And I was the best human ever!

48:04.256 --> 48:08.093
One of the most beloved, respected lords
in history! You know why?

48:09.219 --> 48:11.054
-You had a lot of friends?
-No!

48:11.138 --> 48:15.267
I had all the wealth and land and power,
and everyone loved me for it.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.979
Wait, if you're so great,
why haven't I heard of you?

48:19.062 --> 48:24.026
We-- Well, obviously some jealous rival
took credit for everything after I died.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.654
You died.
The heavens made you a Wish Dragon?

48:27.738 --> 48:29.323
Yes, as a reward.

48:29.406 --> 48:32.534
-You don't seem happy.
-I'm very happy.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.037
So, if you would just use your last wish,

48:35.120 --> 48:38.457
and wish for the same thing
as every other master,

48:38.540 --> 48:39.666
then I can be done

48:39.750 --> 48:42.002
and leave this wretched world.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.212
And finally return back to heaven,

48:44.296 --> 48:48.634
where everyone is waiting to welcome
the great emperor home with a parade.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.304
They have parades in heaven?

48:52.387 --> 48:53.388
[Long sighs]

48:53.472 --> 48:57.643
My point is there's a simple solution
to every problem in the world.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.436
Including yours. Use it.

49:01.021 --> 49:04.900
So, that's what you've learned
after all these years?

49:05.484 --> 49:06.401
Yes.

49:11.531 --> 49:13.075
-[watch chimes]
-[gasps]

49:13.158 --> 49:15.786
Crap, ten o'clock?
My mom's getting off work.

49:15.869 --> 49:18.330
Long, we gotta go! Hurry! Let's go!

49:18.413 --> 49:19.998
[groans]

49:20.082 --> 49:23.752
[Mr. Wang] Sir, surely you can
extend the loan one more week.

49:23.835 --> 49:26.088
I promise, I can pay you back, sir.

49:26.755 --> 49:29.174
Foreclosure?
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

49:29.257 --> 49:31.551
This company is my life's work.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.512
I have a family and a respons--

49:33.595 --> 49:35.013
[disconnect tone drones]

49:35.097 --> 49:37.808
-Is everything all right, sir?
-It's fine.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.184
Just…

49:39.726 --> 49:42.229
just don't tell Li Na about any of this.

49:46.525 --> 49:47.526
[sighs]

50:06.753 --> 50:08.672
Well, have you found it?

50:08.755 --> 50:11.091
We've located the boy's apartment, sir.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.092
Yes, and?

50:12.175 --> 50:15.971
There's no way he can come or go
without being caught.

50:16.054 --> 50:16.888
Good.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.979
Okay, in the teapot. Everything's normal.

50:24.062 --> 50:26.857
-Lights on.
-Think you can bring Li Na to this dump?

50:26.940 --> 50:28.442
Quiet, you! Homework out.

50:28.525 --> 50:30.402
Her fridge is bigger than this apartment.

50:30.485 --> 50:34.239
If you're not gonna say
something helpful, don't say anything.

50:34.322 --> 50:35.574
She's here!

50:37.534 --> 50:38.869
Uh, your suit.

50:38.952 --> 50:40.495
Huh? Oh, no!

50:40.579 --> 50:41.580
[fabric rips]

50:42.748 --> 50:44.374
Din, I brought you some…

50:45.125 --> 50:48.378
Hello, Mother.
Sure is hot out tonight, isn't it?

50:49.171 --> 50:52.090
No, it's freezing.
You coming down with something?

50:52.174 --> 50:54.843
Oh, no. Just… studying.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.887
Okay. Here.

50:56.970 --> 51:00.724
-I'll heat you up some leftovers.
-Li Na will love leftovers.

51:00.807 --> 51:02.392
-Hey, stop it!
-Stop what?

51:02.476 --> 51:06.313
Uh, stop worrying about me. I'm fine.

51:06.396 --> 51:07.898
You don't seem fine.

51:08.648 --> 51:11.401
-How was school?
-Great. School was great.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.361
You lie to everyone, not just yourself.

51:13.445 --> 51:14.863
-Leave me alone.
-Fine.

51:15.947 --> 51:17.699
[gasps] No, Mom. I was just…

51:17.783 --> 51:22.954
-You know where to find me.
-…talking to somebody else.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.166
Din, I'm going to ask you a question.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.293
Remember, I'm your mother.

51:28.376 --> 51:30.087
You can tell me the truth.

51:30.587 --> 51:31.630
Uh-huh.

51:31.713 --> 51:33.465
Are you…

51:34.091 --> 51:35.926
drinking alcohol?

51:36.009 --> 51:39.513
-No. Gimme that! I'm not drinking.
-Where are you hiding it?

51:39.596 --> 51:43.100
Don't lie to me!
Staying out late! Skipping school!

51:43.183 --> 51:45.519
-You're acting crazy all the time.
-Mom!

51:45.602 --> 51:48.772
I am your mother!
I know when something is wrong.

51:48.855 --> 51:50.649
-What is it?
-Nothing is wrong!

51:50.732 --> 51:53.860
Just tell me the truth.
Whatever it is, I can help.

51:54.402 --> 51:55.904
Mom, you can't.

51:56.822 --> 51:57.656
Believe me.

51:58.532 --> 51:59.366
You can't.

52:00.325 --> 52:01.493
Go to your room.

52:01.576 --> 52:03.787
Don't come out
if you're going to disrespect me.

52:03.870 --> 52:04.996
-I wasn't--
-Go!

52:05.080 --> 52:05.914
Fine!

52:08.917 --> 52:10.961
[groans] I hate this place.

52:16.299 --> 52:19.010
-They're really going at it.
-Bring that chair.

52:19.094 --> 52:20.220
Popcorn, anyone?

52:20.303 --> 52:21.638
I can hear you.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.098
[neighbors clamoring]

52:23.181 --> 52:25.100
[poignant music playing]

52:26.434 --> 52:27.394
[Din's mom] Din.

52:28.562 --> 52:29.396
Here.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.485
You…

52:37.070 --> 52:38.446
you need a real dinner.

52:39.698 --> 52:40.574
Thanks.

52:41.658 --> 52:42.659
Sorry, Mom.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.086
[slurps]

53:08.226 --> 53:12.522
Hey, little buddy. You're so cute.
You have family? Are you hungry?

53:12.606 --> 53:16.234
You're such a cute, fluffy,
little, hairy-faced… [babbling]

53:17.152 --> 53:19.154
-It's him! Wake up!
-Huh? Huh?

53:19.237 --> 53:21.364
-Hey, boss! Boss!
-Hey, boss!

53:21.448 --> 53:23.533
-[short henchman] Boss!
-The boy!

53:23.617 --> 53:25.619
[intense music plays]

53:30.457 --> 53:31.541
[engine revs]

53:37.547 --> 53:38.548
Impossible.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.264
Okay, Din. You can do this.

53:46.348 --> 53:47.974
Just tell her the truth.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.185
-[elevator dings]
-Good evening, sir.

53:53.104 --> 53:55.106
-Oh, hey, Dan!
-Hey!

53:55.190 --> 53:59.236
-Sir, may I take your jacket?
-My jacket? I just got this.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.363
[chuckles] Good one, Dan.

54:02.447 --> 54:03.990
[chuckles] Yeah, good one.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.701
Sure. I have plenty more of these at home.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.913
-Thank you. Here you are.
-Here.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.334
Sorry about all the fuss.

54:14.417 --> 54:16.503
My dad insists on "only the best."

54:18.046 --> 54:21.591
Actually, Li Na,
there's something I need to tell you.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.468
I know what you're gonna say.

54:23.551 --> 54:24.636
-You do?
-Yes.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.973
It's so nice to meet someone
from a respectable family

54:28.056 --> 54:30.433
that you enjoy talking to, right?

54:30.517 --> 54:32.978
-Oh.
-Madame, your table is ready.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.522
Right. Respectable.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.234
Long, I'm supposed to be
from a respectable family.

54:39.317 --> 54:42.737
No. What? I'm shocked. I'm stunned.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.865
-It's exactly what I predicted.
-I need your help.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.618
You were from royalty. Tell me what to do.

54:48.702 --> 54:50.829
Fine. Do exactly what I say.

54:50.912 --> 54:53.957
-Okay. Deal.
-Sir, could I offer you a hot tow--

54:54.499 --> 54:56.960
You shouldn't let
commoners talk to you.

54:57.043 --> 54:58.503
-Really?
-Sir, I just--

54:59.045 --> 55:01.965
wanted to offer you a hot towel.

55:02.048 --> 55:03.633
Sir, you just--

55:03.717 --> 55:04.843
[shushes]

55:05.969 --> 55:07.220
Madame, your table.

55:07.304 --> 55:10.140
Demand another table,
claiming it's far superior.

55:10.223 --> 55:15.770
Li Na, this table simply won't do.
Allow me to show you another one.

55:16.604 --> 55:18.982
This is the table
for the hors d'oeuvres.

55:20.817 --> 55:24.946
Well, you tell Mr. and Mrs. Hors D'oeuvres
that this is our table.

55:25.030 --> 55:25.947
[Li Na laughs]

55:26.031 --> 55:27.824
Dan, you're such a funny guy.

55:27.907 --> 55:29.242
[laughs] Funny?

55:29.326 --> 55:33.955
Uh, are you sure you didn't mean
suave, classy, respectable.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.665
[laughing]

55:37.500 --> 55:39.669
You're too good. I'm gonna cry.

55:40.295 --> 55:43.089
I would have her executed
for mocking royalty.

55:43.173 --> 55:46.468
I appreciate you trying
to make this place interesting,

55:46.551 --> 55:48.345
but how about somewhere else?

55:48.428 --> 55:51.222
Somewhere else? Like more fancy than this?

55:51.306 --> 55:52.474
Not good enough?

55:52.557 --> 55:55.810
-Well played, child.
-No, like, a walk or something.

55:55.894 --> 55:57.604
May I take your order?

55:57.687 --> 56:01.191
-Spare no expense. Money's no object.
-One of everything.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.402
Sir, there are over 600 items on our menu.

56:04.486 --> 56:06.780
-Better make that three.
-Good!

56:06.863 --> 56:07.989
As you wish, sir.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.825
So, listen, Dan, about last night,

56:10.909 --> 56:13.620
sorry for acting so weird.

56:13.703 --> 56:16.998
To be honest, it's nice
to have someone who listened.

56:17.082 --> 56:18.833
Ignore her and she's yours.

56:19.501 --> 56:22.879
Look. Rich people
never pay attention to anyone else.

56:22.962 --> 56:26.257
All they talk about is their own business,
how much money they make.

56:26.341 --> 56:30.595
-It's almost an art form.
-Are you listening to anything I said?

56:32.222 --> 56:33.348
Not a word.

56:34.766 --> 56:38.645
Um, okay, well, I was saying
it was really nice to talk to you…

56:38.728 --> 56:41.898
We're close, Din.
Tell her how many palaces you own.

56:41.981 --> 56:45.819
Let me stop you. Did I tell you
just how respectable my family is?

56:45.902 --> 56:47.529
-Your first entree.
-Thanks.

56:47.612 --> 56:48.488
Uh-uh-uh.

56:48.571 --> 56:49.781
For nothing.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.450
Dan! You know what?

56:52.534 --> 56:56.162
-You're just not who I thought you were.
-Wait, Li Na.

56:56.246 --> 56:58.998
I don't understand.
That worked on all 17 of my wives.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.917
-I can explain.
-What now?

57:01.000 --> 57:02.168
I, uh…

57:02.252 --> 57:03.086
We should…

57:03.795 --> 57:05.922
We should go for that walk.

57:08.383 --> 57:09.342
Maybe a run!

57:10.677 --> 57:11.970
Bon appetit!

57:12.053 --> 57:13.304
Surprise!

57:17.642 --> 57:18.601
Hop on.

57:22.021 --> 57:22.981
Fine.

57:24.607 --> 57:25.984
Who were those men?

57:26.067 --> 57:28.736
Gangsters.
Probably out to kidnap us for a ransom.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.822
[crowd clapping, cheering]

57:35.285 --> 57:38.371
-Come on. This way.
-[exciting music playing]

57:38.955 --> 57:40.123
Oh, no.

57:40.707 --> 57:42.792
You've always wanted
to be in a street fight.

57:42.876 --> 57:43.877
-Help.
-[Long] No!

57:43.960 --> 57:46.004
-Stay calm.
-[Din] Come on, please.

57:46.087 --> 57:47.380
-Dan?
-[Long groans]

57:48.715 --> 57:50.508
Look what I found! [laughs]

57:50.592 --> 57:52.594
[exciting percussive music plays]

57:54.721 --> 57:57.599
[Long] Look at me.
How did I become a piñata?

57:57.682 --> 57:59.476
-I think we lost them.
-Good.

57:59.559 --> 58:02.562
So, when exactly
were you going to apologize, Dan?

58:02.645 --> 58:03.480
I…

58:05.398 --> 58:06.691
Huh?

58:06.774 --> 58:07.775
[crowd gasp]

58:09.360 --> 58:11.112
The other way! Other way!

58:13.656 --> 58:14.532
[cheering]

58:14.616 --> 58:19.120
Li Na, I really do want to say I'm sorry.

58:19.204 --> 58:20.622
Sorry for what exactly?

58:20.705 --> 58:23.708
Sorry for acting like such a jerk.

58:23.791 --> 58:25.084
Apology accepted.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.379
Now, get him, Dan.
Kick him right in his stupid face!

58:28.463 --> 58:29.464
Kick him!

58:29.547 --> 58:30.840
[Long spluttering]

58:30.924 --> 58:32.050
[crowd winces]

58:33.593 --> 58:35.386
Hand over the teapot, kid.

58:36.679 --> 58:37.597
[chuckling]

58:40.892 --> 58:45.104
I didn't sign up for this.
If you made your last wish, we-- Oh, no.

58:49.317 --> 58:51.569
This literally could not get any wo--

58:51.653 --> 58:53.154
[Long vomiting wetly]

58:56.533 --> 58:57.992
-Good one.
-Ah. Thanks.

58:58.076 --> 58:59.536
Eat metal, dirt bag!

58:59.619 --> 59:01.621
How do you like them apples, huh?

59:02.956 --> 59:03.790
Crap!

59:11.089 --> 59:12.382
[Li Na] Incoming!

59:31.359 --> 59:32.193
Trust me.

59:33.111 --> 59:35.655
-Li Na, I think we're gonna have to--
-Jump!

59:36.781 --> 59:38.032
[Li Na, Din yelping]

59:41.744 --> 59:43.454
Don't worry. We got this.

59:53.339 --> 59:54.632
[both exclaiming]

59:57.427 --> 59:58.386
[Din] Oh, no!

59:59.137 --> 1:00:00.263
[Li Na] Oh, my God!

1:00:00.346 --> 1:00:02.307
[triumphant music plays]

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:11.107
You know what, Dan?
This is turning into a pretty good date.

1:00:13.026 --> 1:00:14.152
[Long] Oh, no!

1:00:25.163 --> 1:00:26.414
[both coughing]

1:00:27.915 --> 1:00:30.501
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

1:00:31.878 --> 1:00:33.880
[both chuckling]

1:00:37.592 --> 1:00:39.927
[Long] I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:44.098
Oh, boy.

1:00:45.183 --> 1:00:46.059
What happened?

1:00:46.142 --> 1:00:47.477
Time's up, Dan.

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:50.563
What happened?
Well, we jumped off a building.

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:51.898
We almost died.

1:00:52.398 --> 1:00:54.776
-Your 24 hours are over.
-We beat up some gangsters.

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:56.903
-No.
-Okay, that was mostly you.

1:00:56.986 --> 1:00:59.364
You gotta teach me some of that kung fu.

1:01:01.449 --> 1:01:02.367
Whoops.

1:01:02.450 --> 1:01:03.701
Reflexes.

1:01:05.870 --> 1:01:07.830
Wait, what happened to your suit?

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:11.751
Look, Li Na.

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:17.215
There's… something I need to tell you.

1:01:17.298 --> 1:01:19.550
You have one more wish.
You don't have to do this.

1:01:22.345 --> 1:01:24.389
My real name isn't Dan.

1:01:24.472 --> 1:01:25.306
It's…

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:26.724
[Li Na] Din.

1:01:28.434 --> 1:01:29.435
You're Din.

1:01:30.144 --> 1:01:31.896
[groans]

1:01:32.647 --> 1:01:33.648
I'm sorry.

1:01:33.731 --> 1:01:36.359
But… why did you lie?

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:38.569
I wasn't planning to. I just…

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:44.200
I was worried that if you found out
it was, well, just me,

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:46.411
everything would end.

1:01:48.371 --> 1:01:51.332
So, you still live around here?

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:52.875
Yeah.

1:01:52.959 --> 1:01:55.753
In that same old shikumen?

1:01:56.629 --> 1:01:57.463
Yeah.

1:01:58.172 --> 1:02:00.174
I told you this wouldn't end well.

1:02:01.342 --> 1:02:02.176
[Li Na] Wait.

1:02:02.677 --> 1:02:04.178
I remember this alley.

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:08.975
We used to take a shortcut through here
on the way home from school.

1:02:09.058 --> 1:02:10.601
Uh, yeah.

1:02:10.685 --> 1:02:13.563
And Mrs. Chu would sell
those roasted yams.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:16.858
Hey, look at that! It's Mrs. Chu!

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:19.152
Hi, Mrs. Chu. It's Li Na Wang.

1:02:19.235 --> 1:02:21.654
-Do you remember--
-One buck, two yams. No bargaining!

1:02:22.238 --> 1:02:24.323
-Some things never change.
-Here.

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:25.950
[Mrs. Chu] Sold! Next.

1:02:26.033 --> 1:02:27.618
-Ow, ow.
-[Mrs. Chu] Move!

1:02:29.579 --> 1:02:30.496
So good!

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:32.415
Hold on, is that…

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:34.667
[Mrs. Chu] Huh?

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:36.252
[bright, uplifting music]

1:02:36.335 --> 1:02:38.171
[women chanting]

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:39.589
No way! [Li Na laughs]

1:02:39.672 --> 1:02:42.341
Yeah, new decade, same sweatpants!

1:02:46.804 --> 1:02:49.640
Hey, Din, what do you think
about a little race?

1:02:49.724 --> 1:02:51.350
-Three, two, one, go!
-What?

1:02:51.434 --> 1:02:52.602
[Din] Hey!

1:02:52.685 --> 1:02:53.895
[Li Na grunts] Ah!

1:02:56.397 --> 1:02:57.231
Okay.

1:02:57.732 --> 1:02:58.816
Not fair.

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:12.121
So, your old apartment
has to be right around the corner.

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:16.250
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:19.670
-Hey Weijing, you have any green onions?
-Hi, Mrs. Song.

1:03:19.754 --> 1:03:22.089
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

1:03:22.173 --> 1:03:25.009
Hey, Mom. So, uh, surprise!

1:03:25.092 --> 1:03:28.262
We have an unexpected visitor.

1:03:31.641 --> 1:03:34.477
A girl? That's why you're acting crazy?

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.398
All this time worried you were drugged out
in some internet cafe. It was a girl.

1:03:39.482 --> 1:03:41.025
-It's Li Na!
-Just a--

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:44.070
Hi.

1:03:44.153 --> 1:03:46.823
Li Na? What are you doing here?

1:03:47.532 --> 1:03:50.326
Just visiting an old friend.

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:52.203
Oh.

1:03:52.286 --> 1:03:56.082
[Mrs. Song grunts]
Well, where are my manners? Come in.

1:03:56.165 --> 1:03:58.042
You and I are not finished.

1:03:58.584 --> 1:04:01.379
-She's so pretty now.
-Like a princess.

1:04:01.462 --> 1:04:03.422
Well, her nose is a little flat.

1:04:03.506 --> 1:04:05.174
[Mrs. Song] Start with this.

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:09.220
-You really shouldn't go to--
-You're skinnier than a broom handle.

1:04:09.303 --> 1:04:11.347
-I wasn't expecting--
-Li Na!

1:04:11.430 --> 1:04:15.017
Did you know Din puts flowers
on Clucky's grave every year?

1:04:15.101 --> 1:04:16.727
Mr. Huang, cut it out.

1:04:16.811 --> 1:04:18.271
I did not know that.

1:04:18.354 --> 1:04:20.606
He's so cute. He even cries a little.

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:23.234
I am not crying. I am mourning.

1:04:23.317 --> 1:04:26.362
-He even brings flowers.
-A tiny bouquet!

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.282
[muffled chatter]

1:04:31.158 --> 1:04:35.329
[woman singing romantically in Chinese]

1:05:09.655 --> 1:05:10.656
Come in.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:14.368
[song fades away]

1:05:16.412 --> 1:05:18.831
What? You're saying that's not my son?

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:20.750
You knew. Don't lie to me.

1:05:20.833 --> 1:05:23.377
[man] You were lying to me
this whole time.

1:05:23.461 --> 1:05:26.672
You just wanted
to inherit my dad's business.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:29.425
-[woman] Right. I will.
-I know what you did!

1:05:29.508 --> 1:05:32.678
You think you can fool me?
I saw you with that guy.

1:05:32.762 --> 1:05:34.430
[woman] You have no idea.

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:36.557
I should've
listened to my mother.

1:05:36.641 --> 1:05:38.392
-I am your mother.
-No!

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:39.852
[all gasp]

1:05:41.228 --> 1:05:42.063
Here.

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:46.442
Oh, wow. Oh!
It's like a time machine up here.

1:05:46.525 --> 1:05:50.488
Yeah, sorry. This is the only place
I can get peace and quiet.

1:05:50.571 --> 1:05:52.490
[Li Na] You'll never have peace.

1:05:52.573 --> 1:05:55.534
Because the ghost
of Clucky will always haunt you!

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:57.703
-[clucks]
-No, Clucky! You're dead.

1:05:57.787 --> 1:06:00.456
Are you gonna cry?
Are we gonna see tears now?

1:06:00.539 --> 1:06:02.249
I regret nothing. You were delicious.

1:06:02.333 --> 1:06:05.127
You're gonna know
what regret tastes like.

1:06:05.211 --> 1:06:07.421
Get away from me, you ghost chicken.

1:06:07.505 --> 1:06:10.633
-Why did you eat me?
-It was Li Na. She made me do it.

1:06:11.425 --> 1:06:12.718
Selling me out.

1:06:12.802 --> 1:06:14.971
-That's cold.
-It was your idea.

1:06:15.054 --> 1:06:19.266
Yeah. I guess we had
a lot of crazy ideas back then.

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:21.227
Yeah.

1:06:22.144 --> 1:06:24.188
-[shivers]
-Huh? Oh!

1:06:24.271 --> 1:06:25.106
Here.

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:30.486
[both sigh]

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:34.198
Hey, do you remember that promise we made?

1:06:34.281 --> 1:06:36.200
-The pinky--
-Of course!

1:06:36.283 --> 1:06:37.535
How'd it go? Um…

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:40.496
Friends forever, day by…

1:06:40.579 --> 1:06:42.581
[both] Year by year,

1:06:42.665 --> 1:06:44.875
upon this we will always…

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:47.169
swear.

1:06:52.717 --> 1:06:54.051
[billboard buzzes]

1:06:55.094 --> 1:06:56.095
-Oh!
-Whoa!

1:06:56.178 --> 1:06:57.555
-God!
-Are you okay?

1:06:57.638 --> 1:06:59.223
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:07:00.141 --> 1:07:03.602
Sorry, I wasn't expecting
my own giant face.

1:07:03.686 --> 1:07:04.812
So embarrassing.

1:07:04.895 --> 1:07:09.442
[chuckles] Don't be embarrassed.
When I first saw that, I almost fell over.

1:07:10.735 --> 1:07:13.946
But it's been nice.
Kind of like you were back.

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:17.825
But, you know, giant and glowing,
and super glamorous.

1:07:19.118 --> 1:07:21.537
Doesn't hold a candle
to the real thing, though.

1:07:25.207 --> 1:07:27.752
What do you say we go for a real date?

1:07:27.835 --> 1:07:30.421
No Dan or any of that.

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:31.964
I…

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:34.216
[phone rings]

1:07:35.509 --> 1:07:36.385
Sorry.

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:41.348
Where have you been?
The shoot starts in an hour!

1:07:41.432 --> 1:07:44.185
What happened to your hair?
I'm sending a car!

1:07:47.188 --> 1:07:48.105
Um…

1:07:48.939 --> 1:07:50.107
Din…

1:07:50.191 --> 1:07:54.070
I had a really wonderful time tonight,

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:56.447
but I have to go.

1:07:56.947 --> 1:08:00.951
-Thanks for letting me borrow this.
-Keep it till next time.

1:08:01.035 --> 1:08:02.036
No, really, I--

1:08:02.119 --> 1:08:04.622
Not like I'm not gonna see you
for another…

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:08.209
…ten years.

1:08:10.127 --> 1:08:11.128
Din,

1:08:11.212 --> 1:08:16.008
the truth is,
I have this whole other life now.

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:18.344
You know? A career.

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:22.264
A future that my dad
worked really hard for.

1:08:23.265 --> 1:08:27.061
Certain expectations I have to meet.

1:08:28.145 --> 1:08:28.979
Let me guess.

1:08:29.855 --> 1:08:32.983
I don't meet those expectations.

1:08:33.067 --> 1:08:33.943
I…

1:08:34.026 --> 1:08:35.528
You don't understand.

1:08:35.611 --> 1:08:37.738
I… I'm just trying to be…

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:40.825
realistic.

1:08:42.451 --> 1:08:43.327
I'm sorry.

1:08:43.410 --> 1:08:45.412
[emotional music plays]

1:09:06.392 --> 1:09:07.226
Hey, Din.

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:11.522
Did you know that shrimp chips

1:09:11.605 --> 1:09:14.650
don't actually have any shrimp
in the ingredients?

1:09:15.609 --> 1:09:16.443
Okay.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:24.243
Din…

1:09:27.121 --> 1:09:30.708
…things are simpler when you're children.

1:09:31.625 --> 1:09:33.419
But you're older now.

1:09:33.919 --> 1:09:36.380
And, well,

1:09:36.463 --> 1:09:38.215
you have to be realistic.

1:09:42.761 --> 1:09:43.596
Din.

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:49.393
Good news, Long.

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:51.854
You can finally be rid of me.

1:09:52.563 --> 1:09:54.481
I'm ready for my third wish.

1:09:54.565 --> 1:09:55.399
You are?

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:57.193
Make me rich.

1:09:57.276 --> 1:09:58.402
Piles of gold.

1:09:58.485 --> 1:09:59.820
However you do it.

1:09:59.904 --> 1:10:02.239
-But--
-I thought it wouldn't matter.

1:10:02.865 --> 1:10:04.241
That she wouldn't care.

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:07.036
That was stupid.

1:10:08.370 --> 1:10:11.624
Give me the gold,
and I can have some of that good life.

1:10:11.707 --> 1:10:13.876
People will treat me with respect.

1:10:14.793 --> 1:10:18.005
Heck, I'm sure everyone will want
to be my friend then.

1:10:18.088 --> 1:10:19.632
Din… [sighs]

1:10:20.341 --> 1:10:21.300
Are you sure?

1:10:21.383 --> 1:10:25.721
Am I sure? You've been telling me
to make this wish since we met.

1:10:25.804 --> 1:10:28.390
Well, you were right. Okay? I was wrong.

1:10:28.474 --> 1:10:30.226
There you go, that's my wish.

1:10:30.309 --> 1:10:33.520
Just grant it, and you can
go back to your spirit world

1:10:33.604 --> 1:10:35.606
and your stupid parade in the sky.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:40.778
Just grant the wish, Long.

[wind whistling]

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:57.419
Din, I'll grant your wish.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:02.341
But first,
there's something I need to show you.

1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:10.307
You found the boy. Where is he?

1:11:10.391 --> 1:11:13.143
-At the Pearl Tower, sir.
-Yeah, with a girl.

1:11:13.227 --> 1:11:16.021
-But I'm afraid he escaped again.
-What? How?

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:18.023
Hey, that doesn't belong to you.

1:11:21.443 --> 1:11:24.488
Listen to me. I am out of time. I need--

1:11:24.571 --> 1:11:25.531
[elevator dings]

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:33.205
-Li Na! Aren't you supposed to be at--
-I'm sorry, Dad. We really need to talk.

1:11:33.289 --> 1:11:34.123
Of course.

1:11:34.206 --> 1:11:36.792
-I'm just on a very important call.
-Dad.

1:11:37.501 --> 1:11:38.669
Please.

1:11:38.752 --> 1:11:39.670
[bald man] Sir.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:44.842
Do you remember when we lived
in that old shikumen?

1:11:44.925 --> 1:11:48.304
-I know we didn't have much but--
-Don't worry, Li Na.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:50.472
We'll never go back to that life.

1:11:50.556 --> 1:11:53.726
But, Dad, don't you ever miss those days?

1:11:53.809 --> 1:11:56.103
Wha-- Where is all this coming from?

1:11:56.687 --> 1:11:58.647
That… that young man last night,

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:00.816
the one you arranged a date with,

1:12:00.899 --> 1:12:02.568
that was Din.

1:12:03.569 --> 1:12:05.195
From our old neighborhood?

1:12:05.779 --> 1:12:06.780
Yes.

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:10.117
And he's the one who took you
to the Pearl Tower.

1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:12.286
Yes, and I know what you'll say.

1:12:12.369 --> 1:12:16.081
You'll tell me to stay away
and to leave that old world behind,

1:12:16.707 --> 1:12:19.918
but the truth is,
I think we might be happier if--

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:24.340
Li Na, everything's going to be all right.
I'm gonna go talk with Din.

1:12:24.423 --> 1:12:26.592
-What?
-Bring the van in two minutes.

1:12:26.675 --> 1:12:28.093
Dad, are you okay?

1:12:28.719 --> 1:12:30.512
-What's going on?
-Don't worry.

1:12:31.221 --> 1:12:32.890
I'm going to fix everything.

1:12:53.744 --> 1:12:54.953
Where are you going?

1:12:58.624 --> 1:12:59.917
What is this place?

[dramatic music plays]

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:03.379
[energy booms]

1:13:10.886 --> 1:13:14.098
-[Din] Whoa.
-[Long] This was my home.

1:13:16.934 --> 1:13:18.936
I was born into royalty.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.732
I learned from a young age
that gold is power.

1:13:24.650 --> 1:13:27.986
So, I set my sights
on expanding my fortune

1:13:28.070 --> 1:13:29.988
and let nothing stand in my way.

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.866
My subjects were loyal…

1:13:35.244 --> 1:13:38.455
…and worked tirelessly year after year.

1:13:40.624 --> 1:13:43.710
My daughters were married
to the finest families,

1:13:43.794 --> 1:13:45.963
to expand the kingdom's glory.

1:13:48.841 --> 1:13:52.094
And my son,
I sent off to win treasure.

1:13:55.931 --> 1:13:57.474
He came home a hero.

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:02.062
Soon, I had more gold, more land,

1:14:02.146 --> 1:14:05.774
and more monuments
than any lord who had come before me.

1:14:07.484 --> 1:14:08.360
And yet,

1:14:09.111 --> 1:14:11.029
as I laid on my deathbed,

1:14:11.113 --> 1:14:14.783
I awaited the parade
of loyal subjects and loving family.

1:14:15.951 --> 1:14:17.202
But there was none.

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:21.498
With my last breath,
I cursed all who had forgotten me.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:25.085
I arrived at the gates to the spirit world

1:14:25.169 --> 1:14:27.796
and awaited
a great procession to welcome me.

1:14:30.924 --> 1:14:32.509
I demand you open this!

1:14:32.593 --> 1:14:35.804
Instead, the gods transformed me
into a Wish Dragon.

1:14:36.722 --> 1:14:38.056
Not as a reward,

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:40.017
but as a punishment.

1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:42.895
I was imprisoned
and sent down to Earth

1:14:42.978 --> 1:14:46.732
to serve ten masters
and learn the true meaning of life.

1:14:51.862 --> 1:14:53.155
And to be honest,

1:14:53.238 --> 1:14:54.531
all these years,

1:14:54.615 --> 1:14:56.283
all these masters,

1:14:56.366 --> 1:14:57.951
I have been failing.

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:01.330
Until I met you.

1:15:02.247 --> 1:15:06.001
I don't know the meaning of life.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.545
your friends, your family,

1:15:09.171 --> 1:15:11.840
are worth more
than anything I ever possessed.

1:15:11.924 --> 1:15:14.885
And no amount of gold can ever buy that.

1:15:19.848 --> 1:15:21.475
It's your wish, Din.

1:15:22.351 --> 1:15:24.561
Make sure it's what you really want.

Mr. Wang? What are you doing here?

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:36.281
Please, give me that.

And now, everyone will bow to me.
