00:01.569 --> 00:03.571
VOICE: MTV...

00:07.775 --> 00:09.143
Ever heard of Black Nick Adam?

00:09.277 --> 00:11.045
-What is that, a band?
-Motorcycle gang.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.047
They run
the nitrous game out here.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.515
-[sighing]
-They'll kill anyone

00:14.648 --> 00:15.883
that gets in their way.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.251
You know, it's funny,

00:17.385 --> 00:19.887
I've actually met people
like that before.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.427
-It's all right.
-[sobbing]

00:26.560 --> 00:28.162
Tina here?

00:29.197 --> 00:31.299
CHICKIE: You know, it looks bad.
You sneak into town,

00:31.432 --> 00:33.267
-and I'm not aware.
-Come on!

00:33.401 --> 00:35.269
-This is family.
-It's my brother.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.171
My father was
a brother to you, too.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.906
Don't you fuckin'
forget that.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.509
Remember your first
and highest obligation.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.578
Tina, is there any way

00:44.712 --> 00:46.080
for us just to...

00:46.214 --> 00:49.016
-to move past this?
-You left us nothing.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.920
Nico "The Package" Bugliosi
was the only one.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.555
Let's just say
I learned the hard way

00:54.688 --> 00:57.425
-why he's called...
-What, The Package?

00:57.558 --> 00:58.792
Did you know?

00:58.926 --> 01:00.961
Help!
[screaming]

01:14.041 --> 01:16.009
***

01:39.433 --> 01:41.535
Donde esta Pilot?

02:05.526 --> 02:06.960
STACY:
You're late.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.062
You gonna get me another job
when they fire me?

02:09.197 --> 02:12.800
Can I get an OJ
and a cheese Danish, please.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.002
You think it's easy?
I can't just galivant

02:15.135 --> 02:16.504
in and out as I please,
you know?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.138
All right, relax.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.309
-What do you have for us?
-Well, this is interesting.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.876
I sure hope so.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.078
I told you about
the nitrous, obviously.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.947
Huge source of income.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.318
Apparently my boys got into it
with some other crew.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.585
Yeah, you told me this already.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.887
Yes, but this Italian guy

02:34.021 --> 02:36.924
from New York,
he's the real deal, apparently.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.493
-What Italian guy?
-Hey, Roxy,

02:39.627 --> 02:40.928
you're an informant for the ATF.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.096
Nitrous isn't us.
Tell us about guns.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.498
Hold on a second.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.766
What happened
with this Italian guy?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.167
ROXY: Territorial shit.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.769
They tried to muscle in,

02:48.902 --> 02:51.104
Macadams fought back,
it got a little ugly.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.107
-You got a name?
-The Italian? Yeah.

02:54.242 --> 02:57.278
Pike, he's my old man,
did a little digging.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.447
Name's Dwight something.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.749
He's also shaking down
some weed store.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.784
Again, not our purview.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.754
-Can we just focus on
what we're trying--
-HENDRICKS: Shit, wait.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.356
This is the guy
the FBI told us about.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.824
The mob capo who just
got released from jail.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.460
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.928
They sent around notice.
It was a while back, but yeah,

03:15.062 --> 03:18.131
Dwight Manafilotti or something.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.668
Okay, sure, but what does that
have to do with us?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.404
Who knows? Either way,
we should alert the FBI.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.674
I'm sure they'd love to hear
what he's been up to.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.276
Thank you.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.681
Gonna hit the head.
Be right back.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.754
Okay, first of all,
your job is to get information

03:40.888 --> 03:43.324
on Caolan Waltrip,
not bullshit Italians.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.093
And I need you to cool
that situation down now.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.795
-What do you mean?
-I mean talk to

03:47.928 --> 03:49.663
your boyfriend, Carson Pike,

03:49.797 --> 03:52.400
and get Waltrip
to back the fuck off.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.302
And get me some shit on him.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.670
Finances, accounts, businesses
he's laundering money through.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.273
-Something I can
bring a prosecutor.
-How about I split some atoms

03:59.407 --> 04:01.742
while I shit jelly beans
for you too? [scoffs]

04:01.875 --> 04:04.345
I do like jelly beans.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.947
Just get it done.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.653
You really should eat something.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.988
-I'm not hungry.
-Yeah, well...

04:15.789 --> 04:18.792
vodka is more noticeable
than you think it is.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.895
CHICKIE:
Totally out of control.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.231
Completely off
the fucking reservation.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.434
I know he's your friend,
Pop, but Jesus.

04:26.567 --> 04:30.070
My friend? He's your godfather,
for fuck's sake.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.805
He stood up for you
at your christening.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.474
In the club, though?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.509
No warning, no nothing.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.311
Five hours it took to clean up.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.648
-Who knew about this?
-About what?

04:40.781 --> 04:45.285
About whatever was going on
between Nico and the daughter.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.621
You know, Dwight came to
visit me in the hospital.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.623
He was very, very agitated.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.860
All I know is Nico
used to go over there.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.595
But that was years ago.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.931
Pete, if I can interject,
if any of us had any inkling,

04:58.065 --> 05:00.568
any idea, we would have
took Nico out ourselves.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.372
The bigger question is,
what do we do with Dwight?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.073
Enough already. Take him out.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.808
Him and his fucking daughter.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.378
What'd you say? [grunts]

05:11.445 --> 05:13.013
You all right?

05:14.482 --> 05:16.584
-His daughter?
-[smack]

05:16.717 --> 05:18.719
His fucking daughter?

05:18.852 --> 05:21.889
What did his daughter do? Huh?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.091
Nico...

05:24.224 --> 05:26.827
Nico, that fucking cocksucker.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.397
I'd have skinned him alive.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.935
CHICKE:
I hear you...

05:35.969 --> 05:39.106
But how much more disrespect
are we gonna take

05:39.239 --> 05:41.809
-from this fucking Dwight?
-Dwight.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.045
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight.
Worry about yourself.

05:46.146 --> 05:50.718
If you were half the man he was,
this would have never happened.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.693
Why do you make me
treat you like this? Huh?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.902
***

06:31.992 --> 06:39.232
***

07:20.708 --> 07:22.309
[bell chiming]

07:23.944 --> 07:26.046
What are you doing here? I
thought you went back to Tulsa.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.381
I wanted to talk to you first.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.485
Hey, excuse me.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.453
Won't take long.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.223
My God,
is that blood on your hands?

07:36.356 --> 07:38.559
Let me just say
what I gotta say.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.927
I don't think I want to hear it.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.162
Let me talk.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.531
Please.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.137
He's gone.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.076
Tell me you didn't do it.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.811
Tell me that's not true.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.313
-[clattering]
-[choking]

08:00.447 --> 08:01.849
It's true.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.620
I was handling it in my own way.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.957
And I handled it in mine.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.458
TINA:
Jesus Christ.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.195
He's dead.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.865
I've been around
long enough to realize

08:17.998 --> 08:24.304
there's a line you do not cross
and expect to come back from.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.608
He crossed it.
He scarred you for life.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.378
And I took his life.
And you should have no guilt.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
None. None.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.322
Are you saying that
you feel nothing...

08:43.591 --> 08:45.258
taking a life?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.327
DWIGHT:
You know what I am.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.866
And you know what
I would do if I found out.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.571
This was justifiable vengeance.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.644
Look at me.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.215
I know I haven't
acted like one...

09:09.549 --> 09:11.218
but I'm your father.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.921
And I love you.

09:15.555 --> 09:20.393
I don't know if you believe
that or not, but it's true.

09:21.862 --> 09:26.133
Maybe you think I did this for
me because there's some code,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.401
but no,
it's so much deeper than that.

09:28.535 --> 09:34.541
It's a bond between father
and daughter, and it's...

09:34.675 --> 09:38.345
It can't be explained, but
it's-- but it's in the blood.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.582
I wasted my life.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.384
I know that.

09:44.517 --> 09:48.021
And every bad thing
that happened to you

09:48.155 --> 09:51.992
happened because
I bought into this lie.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.597
Don't you see
that wherever you go...

09:58.999 --> 10:00.668
something bad happens?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.537
You just destroyed my life.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.374
What do you think
they're going to do to us?

10:07.507 --> 10:09.342
-They'll come after me.
-How do you know that?

10:09.476 --> 10:10.610
I know Pete.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.379
I know how he thinks,

10:12.512 --> 10:16.083
He's bad, but not in that way.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.686
Tina, they'll come for me.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.320
You'll be safe.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.105
[bell dings]

10:53.687 --> 10:56.656
Tyson, where you been?
I've been calling.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.092
Long story.
Armand relayed a message to me.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.493
I'll take that.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.930
-What happened here?
-Impound.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.398
Got hauled off.
Spent the night in jail.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.367
They took my phone,
which is why I couldn't even

11:07.500 --> 11:10.270
-get in contact with you.
-What did you get arrested for?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.472
Working for you, apparently.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.208
I'm gonna go see Donnie Shore.
You don't worry about it.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.387
By the way, that phone
had all my contacts in it, man.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.056
I'm talking all my contacts.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.058
Not to mention some photos
of a very intimate nature,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.126
-if you know what I'm--
-You got a password on it.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.128
Yeah, but they're good at
hacking shit.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.997
Hey, what the fuck is up
with your hand, man?

11:37.130 --> 11:40.033
A dog bit me.
Let's go see Bodhi.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.869
Shit.

11:49.509 --> 11:54.114
[phone ringing]

11:54.247 --> 11:56.449
BODHI:
You've reached Bodhi.
Leave a message.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.051
-Namaste.
-[phone beeps]

11:58.185 --> 12:00.954
Where are you, in Tibet?
Give me a call.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.492
When you talked to the cops,
what did you say about me?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.160
I didn't tell them shit.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.829
[Dwight sighs]

12:08.962 --> 12:10.864
-Is Bodhi in your contacts?
-Yeah, of course he is.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.399
-Why?
-Why?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.301
-Why?
-We talk. We say things.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.403
Follow me.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.738
Dwight Manfredi.
This is the guy,

12:18.872 --> 12:20.874
the mob capo
who just got out of jail.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.709
No, I remember his face.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.745
I just don't know
why we need to involve the FBI.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.180
I'm not involving them.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.882
I'm just letting them know
what's going on.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.118
-Professional courtesy.
-Hold on a second.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.287
You really want them
to just blow into town

12:34.421 --> 12:36.289
and take credit for
our whole investigation?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.757
I mean, that's assuming
they don't just

12:37.891 --> 12:40.027
fuck up the whole thing first.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.163
Since when did you become
so territorial?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.066
[phone dialing]

12:46.199 --> 12:47.968
RUIZ:
FBI, Agent Ruiz speaking.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.770
Oscar, Doug Hendricks with ATF.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.740
Listen, I got something for you.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.546
Easy, Rich.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.749
Bring him in and bed him
when you're done, all right?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.455
Can't believe
you started smoking again.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.756
You were doing so good.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.425
You the Surgeon General now?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.864
Your boy Dwight,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.932
would he be interested in
sitting down with Waltrip

13:19.066 --> 13:20.868
if I could arrange it?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.270
Is this an olive branch?

13:23.403 --> 13:24.938
Of sorts.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.708
Shit like what
happened that night

13:28.842 --> 13:31.144
brings a lot of heat.
Heat costs money.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.847
Well, I'll relay it. After that,
it's out of my hands.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.251
How'd you hook up
with this guy anyway?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.720
Just kind of bumped
into each other by accident.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.192
All right.
I'll keep you posted.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.102
[phone ringing]

13:58.805 --> 14:00.173
Hello?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.143
Hello?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.214
Is anyone there?

14:10.783 --> 14:12.285
Who was that?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.888

He's clean. You owe me.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.643
And second, are you
fucking kidding me, Dwight?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.544
I don't know where you've been.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.146
For all we know,
you could have flipped.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.115
Do people who flip
usually lead off with the fact

26:56.248 --> 26:58.250
that they were interrogated
and raided by the Feds?

26:58.384 --> 27:01.087
No, they don't,
but what did you tell them?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.755
The truth.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.524
That we're business partners.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.559
-Business partners?
-Yeah.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.196
Because we are.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.369
That's it? That's all you said?

27:17.503 --> 27:21.140
That and something to the effect
that they can fuck off

27:21.273 --> 27:24.176
and leave me alone,
but essentially, yes.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.978
Why'd you say that?

27:27.213 --> 27:29.048
Honestly,
I don't know why I didn't

27:29.181 --> 27:31.684
call the FBI the day
you walked into my shop.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.353
I probably should have,
but I didn't.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.696
Christmas came early.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.264
Stay there.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.110
You're welcome.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.378
What's that?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.488

these guys were gonna raid,

28:09.621 --> 28:11.824
so we put it all on ice.

Hey. Don't you fucking kiss me.

if I join you for dinner?
-Please do.

Sweetheart.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.172

-Not hungry?

29:00.306 --> 29:03.542
Well, looks like
my date stood me up.

29:03.675 --> 29:06.212
Usually he comes
clomping along here

29:06.345 --> 29:07.880
around this time, and...

29:08.014 --> 29:11.717
Oh, you mean Pilot.
I'm sorry, he's being put down.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.252
Put down? Why?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.855
The fines.
He keeps breaking out.

apparently.

-SPENCER: Spencer.
-Hey, Spencer.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.833
Nice to meet you officially.
But I'm actually leaving.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.501
-Today's my last day.
-Oh.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.603
You have another job?

29:31.737 --> 29:33.705
Not yet.
Still looking.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.345

29:57.363 --> 29:58.764
How you doing?

29:59.765 --> 30:00.967
I'm looking to buy a horse.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.703
It's a white--
That's him right there.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.906
STABLEHAND:
I'm sorry, signor.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.075
Knocker's on his way.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.543
That's the owner?

30:11.677 --> 30:14.813
A knocker is a person
that gets rid of dead animals.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.316
-Seriously?
-They shoot him, sir.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.452
They make dog food,
glue, leather.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.589
He's a good horse.
Stubborn, but good.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.892
He keeps running away.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.160
-How much is he giving you?
-The knocker?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.462
[chuckles] We pay him, signor.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.732
You pay him. Okay.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.734
How about I give you
$300 for the horse

30:35.868 --> 30:37.703
-To take this animal?
-Yeah.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.972
Well, that's plenty, sir.
Thank you.

30:40.106 --> 30:43.209
There's a guy named Armand.
He got a trailer.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.711
Now, he's gonna come around
here, pick this horse up.

everything goes smoothly

30:53.119 --> 30:55.154
You got my number
if there's a problem, right?

-You got it.
-Okay.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.061
Can I ask you, sir, a question?

31:02.194 --> 31:05.531
Why this horse?
He's old, he's stupid.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.900
Not good for anything anymore.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.037

-Okay.

-Help how?
-STACY: We can set him up.

you want to buy some guns.

He's got an arsenal.
He'll be fucking gone.

out, but I can't do it.

not going to help me out?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.544
I can't.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.315
All right.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.985

Any particular message?

with the grease ball?

-Sausage.

of asking for an extension.

find out who burned that car?
