Jake!

00:10.834 --> 00:12.583
Jake!

00:13.834 --> 00:16.667
Jake, wait a second.

00:16.709 --> 00:17.917
How you doing?

00:19.166 --> 00:20.583
I'm fine.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.000
Really.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.875
Jake, I'm sorry.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.291
DR. CRUSHER:

00:25.917 --> 00:27.291
Acting Ensign Crusher,

00:27.333 --> 00:30.458
report to Transporter

00:27.333 --> 00:30.458
Room eight.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.792
It's not your fault.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.417
Yeah, I know.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.291
I wish both of us

00:35.458 --> 00:37.291
were going.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.792
Ah... only 32 points...

00:39.834 --> 00:41.709
Mr. Crusher, respond.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.166
I'm on my way, Doctor.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.375
I've got to go.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.834
I know.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.959
Hey, Wes...

00:53.000 --> 00:54.750
do well for both

00:53.000 --> 00:54.750
of us, okay?

00:54.792 --> 00:56.583
All right.

01:35.792 --> 01:36.875
Thank you.

Jean-Luc Picard--

Dexter Remmick.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.792
Sir.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.333
Allow me

01:41.834 --> 01:43.333
to introduce my staff.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.792
First officer,

01:43.375 --> 01:44.792
William Riker.

Chief of Security,

01:46.333 --> 01:49.750
Natasha Yar.

01:49.792 --> 01:51.542
Well, what can

01:49.792 --> 01:51.542
we do for you?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.083
I need to speak with you.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.125
Certainly. This way.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.125
Number One?

01:55.166 --> 01:57.250
Alone.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.208
Is this a personal matter?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.542
Official business.

02:01.583 --> 02:02.750
Well, then,

02:01.583 --> 02:02.750
my first officer should...

02:02.792 --> 02:04.333
Alone, Captain.

02:31.959 --> 02:35.375
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

02:37.125 --> 02:38.417
<i>These are the voyages</i>

02:38.458 --> 02:41.041
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:46.500
<i>to explore</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:46.500

02:51.458 --> 02:55.000
<i>to boldly go</i>

02:51.458 --> 02:55.000
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:12.709 --> 04:15.917
Commander Remmick is with

04:12.709 --> 04:15.917
the Inspector General's office.

04:17.542 --> 04:18.834
Oh.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.792
He'll be conducting

04:18.875 --> 04:20.792
a full investigation

04:20.834 --> 04:22.000
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

04:23.250 --> 04:24.458
What are you looking for?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.041
I have reason

04:24.500 --> 04:26.041
to believe

04:26.083 --> 04:29.000
that there may be something

04:26.083 --> 04:29.000
very wrong on this ship.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.792
Tell me what you suspect.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.375
It's inappropriate to discuss it

04:30.834 --> 04:33.375
at this time.

04:33.417 --> 04:36.458
Mr. Remmick, Starfleet

04:33.417 --> 04:36.458
is counting on you.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.291
You will find out what is wrong

04:36.500 --> 04:40.291
on this ship.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.709
Yes, sir.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.750
Nothing and no one

04:41.750 --> 04:44.750
will stand in my way.

04:44.792 --> 04:47.166
And you,

04:44.792 --> 04:47.166
Captain...

04:47.208 --> 04:49.667
are ordered to cooperate

04:47.208 --> 04:49.667
in every way necessary

04:49.709 --> 04:51.542
with this investigation.

04:49.709 --> 04:51.542
Is that clear?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.291
Yes, sir.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.000
Mr. Remmick, unless there are

04:53.333 --> 04:56.000
any further questions...

04:56.041 --> 04:57.041
No questions, sir.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.250
Get on with

04:57.083 --> 04:58.250
your duties.

04:58.291 --> 04:59.500
Yes, sir.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.166
We've known one another

05:06.750 --> 05:09.166
for years.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.458
Tell me what

05:09.208 --> 05:11.458
you believe is wrong.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.417
Captain, it is vitally important

05:13.458 --> 05:16.000
that my orders

05:13.458 --> 05:16.000
be followed exactly.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.166
I'll be staying on the ship.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.625
As you wish, Admiral.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.208
(<i> rapid beeping</i> )

05:30.083 --> 05:31.625
What is it?

05:31.667 --> 05:33.041
What?

05:33.083 --> 05:35.667
The unit you

05:33.083 --> 05:35.667
just put down.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.500
Don't worry,

05:35.709 --> 05:38.500
I won't tell anyone.

05:38.542 --> 05:41.500
It's a flux coordinating

05:38.542 --> 05:41.500

05:41.542 --> 05:45.166
I'm Oliana Mirren, one

05:41.542 --> 05:45.166
of the other finalists.

You must be

05:45.208 --> 05:47.417
Wesley Crusher.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.041
Yeah.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.667
Do you know me?

05:50.709 --> 05:53.750
I heard there was a very smart,

05:50.709 --> 05:53.750
very young man

05:53.792 --> 05:56.333
who would be

05:53.792 --> 05:56.333
tough competition.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.000
Well,<i> you</i> wouldn't be here...

05:58.041 --> 05:59.083
If I weren't smart.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.166
I know.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.875
But there's a lot more to it

06:01.208 --> 06:03.875
than just that.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.583
You're lucky.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.125
You've had practical experience

06:05.625 --> 06:08.125

You do not look as if you

06:17.208 --> 06:20.291
meet the age requirements.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.583
I'll be 16 next month.

Oh, happy birthday.

I thought you were

06:41.083 --> 06:43.000
already in the Academy.

06:43.041 --> 06:44.083
No.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.125
Only a hopeful, like you.

Welcome.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.750
You are here

07:07.000 --> 07:09.750
because you are all

07:09.792 --> 07:11.417
top candidates.

07:11.458 --> 07:12.792
Although only

07:11.458 --> 07:12.792
one student

07:12.834 --> 07:14.667
will be chosen

07:12.834 --> 07:14.667
for the Academy,

07:14.709 --> 07:16.709
you have shown from

07:14.709 --> 07:16.709
the preliminary testing

07:16.750 --> 07:21.875
that any of you

07:16.750 --> 07:21.875
could easily qualify.

07:21.917 --> 07:25.125
Now, this may be

07:21.917 --> 07:25.125
the most difficult,

07:25.166 --> 07:27.792
exhausting experience

07:25.166 --> 07:27.792
of your life--

07:27.834 --> 07:31.125
and the most exciting

07:27.834 --> 07:31.125
challenge.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.041
Expect...

07:33.083 --> 07:35.750
the unexpected.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.792
May you all do your best.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.709
May I help you, Mr. Remmick?

07:55.750 --> 07:58.291
Keep doing whatever it is

07:55.750 --> 07:58.291
you're doing, Commander Data.

08:08.792 --> 08:12.083
There's, uh, nothing much

08:08.792 --> 08:12.083
to see here, Commander.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.667
We're in a standard orbit,

08:12.125 --> 08:14.667
and, uh...

08:14.709 --> 08:18.125
the station has to be manned

08:14.709 --> 08:18.125
even if it's just routine.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.583
Something I can

08:18.166 --> 08:21.583
help you with,

08:18.166 --> 08:21.583
Mr. Remmick?

08:21.625 --> 08:23.208
When I'm ready,

08:21.625 --> 08:23.208
Mr. Riker,

08:23.250 --> 08:25.875
I'll want to speak

08:23.250 --> 08:25.875
with you... privately.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.959
Commander.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.041
Just having that guy around

08:32.000 --> 08:34.041
makes me feel guilty.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.667
What's he after, anyway?

08:35.709 --> 08:37.709
I don't know, Geordi,

08:35.709 --> 08:37.709
but I'm going to find out

08:37.750 --> 08:39.041
right now.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.250
(<i> doorbell chimes</i> )

08:41.291 --> 08:43.041
Come.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.709
Captain,

08:45.750 --> 08:47.709
may I speak frankly?

08:47.750 --> 08:49.250
Always, Number One.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.667
As First Officer,

08:49.291 --> 08:50.667
I should be informed.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.291
I should know everything

08:50.709 --> 08:52.291
that you know.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.959
That's right,

08:52.333 --> 08:53.959
you should.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.750
Then what's this about?

08:55.792 --> 08:58.583
Remmick's going to turn

08:55.792 --> 08:58.583
this ship upside down.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.500
That's his job.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.208
And my job is to see that

09:01.542 --> 09:04.208
this ship runs smoothly.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.500
Which you do very well.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.333
Sir, am I under

09:08.709 --> 09:10.333
investigation?

09:11.709 --> 09:13.750
I don't know.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.083
And if you did?

09:15.125 --> 09:16.458
I couldn't tell you.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.917
I don't understand, sir.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.041
This is extremely frustrating.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.458
No less for me.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.458
But I promised cooperation,

09:24.500 --> 09:25.750
and that's

09:24.500 --> 09:25.750
what we shall give.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.291
Sir.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.333
I want some answers from

09:32.250 --> 09:34.333
you now, Commander Riker...

09:32.250 --> 09:34.333
Later.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.458
You were ordered

09:34.375 --> 09:36.458
to cooperate.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.458
Not now!

09:36.500 --> 09:38.625
When it doesn't interfere

09:36.500 --> 09:38.625
with my duties, Remmick.

Last question

09:50.291 --> 09:54.083
on the hyperspace physics test.

09:54.125 --> 09:58.583
If the matter and antimatter

09:54.125 --> 09:58.583

09:58.625 --> 10:02.542
are nine-tenths depleted,

necessary to reach

10:02.583 --> 10:05.834

(<i> sighs</i> )

10:28.417 --> 10:31.041
Time elapsed.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.417
You now have one hour free

10:31.083 --> 10:34.417
before the next test.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.125
I must admit, Wesley,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.125
you have a very fast mind.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.083
Once I realized it

10:41.166 --> 10:43.083
was a trick question,

10:43.125 --> 10:44.667
there was only

10:43.125 --> 10:44.667
one answer.

10:44.709 --> 10:49.083
Yes. There is only one ratio

10:44.709 --> 10:49.083
with matter-antimatter.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.583
One to one.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.250
You both don't know

10:50.625 --> 10:53.250
how lucky you are.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.250
I can't imagine

10:53.291 --> 10:55.250
what it would be like

10:55.291 --> 10:57.291
to have things

10:55.291 --> 10:57.291
come so easily.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.041
I have to push

10:57.333 --> 11:00.041
every step of the way.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.083
Oh, no, Oliana,

11:02.125 --> 11:04.250
it doesn't come

11:02.125 --> 11:04.250
that easily.

11:04.291 --> 11:06.125
I have to study

11:04.291 --> 11:06.125
all the time.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.709
It's a good thing

11:06.166 --> 11:08.709
you're cute, Wesley,

11:08.750 --> 11:10.917
or you could

11:08.750 --> 11:10.917
really be obnoxious.

11:10.959 --> 11:12.834
See you later.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.041
Did you hear what

11:16.000 --> 11:19.041
she said, Mordock?

11:19.083 --> 11:20.667
She said

11:19.083 --> 11:20.667
I was cute.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.709
Is that good,

11:21.917 --> 11:23.709
Wesley?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.375
Yes.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.709
I think.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.542
I think I should

11:34.250 --> 11:36.542
apologize, Captain.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.750
No need,

11:36.583 --> 11:37.750
Number One.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.375
Mr. Remmick's presence

11:37.792 --> 11:39.375
is unnerving

11:39.417 --> 11:40.709
to say the least.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.500
Are you available now,

11:40.750 --> 11:42.500
Mr. Riker,

11:42.542 --> 11:45.125
or do you still have

11:42.542 --> 11:45.125
duties to perform?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.625
I'm available, Mr. Remmick.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.208
Any problem with using

11:53.166 --> 11:55.208
your ready room, Captain?

11:55.250 --> 11:56.750
No, Mr. Remmick.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.875
Be my guest.

12:19.291 --> 12:22.625
If you prefer to stand,

12:19.291 --> 12:22.625
fine, Mr. Riker.

12:22.667 --> 12:26.417
It won't have an effect

12:22.667 --> 12:26.417
on the length of my inquiry.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.959
Now...

12:34.000 --> 12:35.834
there are several

12:34.000 --> 12:35.834
seeming discrepancies

12:35.875 --> 12:37.166
in the Captain's Log.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.792
Let's go over them

12:37.208 --> 12:39.792
one by one, shall we?

12:39.834 --> 12:41.667
The Captain's Log?

12:41.709 --> 12:43.333
Yes.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.750
(<i> beeping</i> )

12:44.792 --> 12:46.417
To the best of your knowledge,

12:46.458 --> 12:48.917
has the Captain ever

12:46.458 --> 12:48.917
falsified a log?

12:51.166 --> 12:52.709
Have you discussed this

12:51.166 --> 12:52.709
with him?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.667
Right now, I'm asking you.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.333
If you want to discuss anything

12:54.709 --> 12:56.333
about Captain Picard,

12:56.375 --> 12:58.125
you bring him in here,

12:56.375 --> 12:58.125
and you ask him, face-to-face.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.667
You are required to answer

12:58.166 --> 13:00.667
my questions, Mr. Riker,

13:00.709 --> 13:02.375
unless you're trying

13:00.709 --> 13:02.375
to cover something up!

13:08.834 --> 13:10.875
(<i> grunts softly</i> )

13:10.917 --> 13:15.208
Now... there are

13:10.917 --> 13:15.208
several discrepancies

13:15.250 --> 13:16.709
in the Captain's Log.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.041
Shall we go over them

13:18.333 --> 13:20.041
one by one?

13:24.583 --> 13:26.625
Proceed.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.250
REMMICK:

13:28.500 --> 13:31.250
So, you are saying

13:28.500 --> 13:31.250
Captain Picard had

13:31.291 --> 13:32.834
no control over

13:31.291 --> 13:32.834
this vessel.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.542
He handed it over

13:32.875 --> 13:34.542
to Kosinski

13:34.583 --> 13:35.917
who took the

13:34.583 --> 13:35.917
entire crew

13:35.959 --> 13:37.250
to the edge

13:35.959 --> 13:37.250
of the universe.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.208
No, sir,

13:37.291 --> 13:39.208
that's not what I'm saying.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.625
Now, Kosinski was sent here

13:39.250 --> 13:40.625
by Starfleet

13:40.667 --> 13:42.208
to improve

13:40.667 --> 13:42.208
our warp drive system.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.208
Captain Picard was ordered

13:42.250 --> 13:44.208
to take him aboard.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.709
According to his own logs,

13:46.750 --> 13:48.875
his bridge crew

13:46.750 --> 13:48.875
didn't think highly

13:48.917 --> 13:50.500
of Mr. Kosinski's

13:48.917 --> 13:50.500
theories.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.333
Yet, the Captain allowed him

13:50.542 --> 13:53.333
to access the engines anyway.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.834
Is that true, La Forge?

13:54.875 --> 13:55.917
Not exactly, sir.

13:55.959 --> 13:58.041
One way or the other,

13:55.959 --> 13:58.041
La Forge,

13:58.083 --> 13:59.458
Picard lost control

13:58.083 --> 13:59.458
of this ship.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.750
Is that true?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.166
Well, yes, but that's not

14:02.375 --> 14:04.166
how it happened.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.542
So...

14:04.208 --> 14:06.542
the answer is yes.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.125
(<i> beeping</i> )

14:08.166 --> 14:09.959
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:10.000 --> 14:12.083
Do you believe the captain

14:10.000 --> 14:12.083
is emotionally

14:12.125 --> 14:13.625
and psychologically fit

14:13.667 --> 14:15.291
for command of

14:13.667 --> 14:15.291
this starship?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.375
There's nothing in his

14:15.333 --> 14:17.375
history or personality

14:17.417 --> 14:19.291
that would

14:17.417 --> 14:19.291
suggest, uh...

14:19.333 --> 14:20.625
mental lapses?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.166
Nothing.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.834
Not even

14:24.458 --> 14:25.834
the Ferengi incident

14:25.875 --> 14:28.250
aboard his old starship,

14:25.875 --> 14:28.250
the<i> Stargazer?</i>

14:29.417 --> 14:30.834
He was being controlled

14:30.875 --> 14:33.500
by a mind-altering

14:30.875 --> 14:33.500
machine, Commander...

14:33.542 --> 14:35.208
without his knowledge!

14:36.625 --> 14:39.208
I would call that

14:36.625 --> 14:39.208
"a mental lapse."

14:57.375 --> 14:59.583
(<i> beeping</i> )

14:59.625 --> 15:01.333
Ensign.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.166
What are you doing

15:01.375 --> 15:03.166
on the holodeck?

15:03.208 --> 15:05.291
I thought you were

15:03.208 --> 15:05.291
still on Relva VII.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.125
I'm finished testing

15:05.333 --> 15:07.125
for the day.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.625
I've disturbed you.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.625
I'll leave.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.583
Wait.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.000
I thought

15:11.625 --> 15:14.000
I wanted to be alone.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.125
I guess I don't.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.583
How is the testing?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.417
Okay, so far.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.917
It's not the ones

15:19.458 --> 15:20.917
that I've studied for

15:20.959 --> 15:22.250
that I'm worried about.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.000
It's the psych test--

15:24.041 --> 15:26.750
facing my deepest fear

15:24.041 --> 15:26.750
and living through it.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.834
I'm trying to

15:26.792 --> 15:27.834
figure out

15:27.875 --> 15:29.041
what images

15:27.875 --> 15:29.041
to bring up.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.458
Why?

15:32.041 --> 15:33.834
Guess I want

15:32.041 --> 15:33.834
to scare myself.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.000
What do you think?

15:33.875 --> 15:36.000
Bulgallian rats?

15:36.041 --> 15:38.667
Lightning storms?

15:38.709 --> 15:41.625
Do those things

15:38.709 --> 15:41.625
frighten you?

15:41.667 --> 15:43.834
Sort of, I guess.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.291
The psych test is

15:43.875 --> 15:46.291
no more or less important

15:46.333 --> 15:47.667
than the rest

15:46.333 --> 15:47.667
of the process.

15:47.709 --> 15:49.125
That's what they said,

15:49.166 --> 15:51.083
but I can't stop thinking

15:49.166 --> 15:51.083
about it.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.542
Thinking about what you

15:51.125 --> 15:54.542
can't control only wastes energy

15:54.583 --> 15:56.709
and creates its own enemy.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.500
How can<i> they</i> know

15:59.542 --> 16:01.750
what my deepest fear is

15:59.542 --> 16:01.750
when<i> I</i> don't?

16:01.792 --> 16:05.375
By analyzing

16:01.792 --> 16:05.375
your psychological profile.

16:05.417 --> 16:08.667
They were very accurate

16:05.417 --> 16:08.667
about everyone I tested with.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.583
Including myself.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.583
You?

16:13.625 --> 16:15.417
I thought there was nothing

16:13.625 --> 16:15.417
that could frighten

16:15.458 --> 16:16.458
a Klingon warrior.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.667
Only fools have no fear.

16:20.291 --> 16:21.667
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.333
I'm asking

16:21.709 --> 16:23.333
too many personal questions.

16:25.959 --> 16:29.166
It is very difficult for me

16:29.208 --> 16:31.875
to depend on anyone

16:29.208 --> 16:31.875
for anything...

16:34.542 --> 16:36.959
...but especially for my life.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.375
But on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

16:37.000 --> 16:39.375
you do that every day.

16:39.417 --> 16:42.417
Everyone depends on

16:39.417 --> 16:42.417
everyone else to

16:39.417 --> 16:42.417
protect them.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.583
Yes.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.792
So you overcame it?

16:44.834 --> 16:48.208
No. It is still my enemy.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.041
RIKER:

16:49.625 --> 16:51.041
With this new

16:49.625 --> 16:51.041
extricator, sir,

16:51.083 --> 16:52.458
we could eliminate

16:51.083 --> 16:52.458
three more bulky machines

16:52.500 --> 16:53.625
from cargo space.

16:53.667 --> 16:54.834
That's excellent,

(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

is Lieutenant Yar.

Isn't that area secured?

Too late. He's using

18:02.041 --> 18:04.667
Captain, he's unbalanced

18:02.041 --> 18:04.667
the dilithium reaction.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.083
I've lost power.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.041
All he's got left is

18:10.125 --> 18:12.041
his maneuvering jets, Captain.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.667
At this trajectory,

18:12.083 --> 18:13.667
he'll enter the atmosphere

18:13.709 --> 18:16.625
and burn up at an altitude

18:13.709 --> 18:16.625
of 200 kilometers.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.000
Probable impact?

18:18.041 --> 18:20.166
Atmospheric entry,

18:18.041 --> 18:20.166
78 seconds.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.125
PICARD:

18:20.208 --> 18:22.125
Options?

18:20.208 --> 18:22.125
Tractor beam?

18:22.166 --> 18:23.583
Not possible.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.375
He's too far away

18:23.625 --> 18:25.375
for a positive lock.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.125
He's out of transporter range.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.083
Captain, you are

18:27.166 --> 18:29.083
completely responsible

18:29.125 --> 18:30.667
for that boy's life.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.875
Mr. Remmick, either get

18:30.709 --> 18:32.875
out of my way and keep quiet

18:32.917 --> 18:35.625
or I will have you removed

18:32.917 --> 18:35.625
from the bridge.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.250
Viewer on shuttle cockpit.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.291
Visual

18:39.291 --> 18:41.291
on main viewer.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.417
Mr. Kurland?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.834
I can't get the engine

18:42.458 --> 18:44.834
started.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.417
What am I going to do?

18:47.458 --> 18:49.083
I'm going to crash.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.709
He needs

18:49.125 --> 18:50.709
another 50 seconds

18:50.750 --> 18:52.875
for the core to cool down

18:50.750 --> 18:52.875
before he can restart.

18:52.917 --> 18:55.458
Stay calm, Jake.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.208
We'll get you back.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.250
Please, help me.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.667
PICARD:

19:10.500 --> 19:11.667
Jake.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.375
It's no use, Captain.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.000
I'm going to die out here.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.959
He'll need another 30 seconds

19:15.041 --> 19:16.959
before he can restart.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.250
Irrelevant, sir.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.667
Even if he restarts

19:18.291 --> 19:19.667
his engine now,

19:19.709 --> 19:21.917
he will not have enough

19:19.709 --> 19:21.917
thrust to escape impact.

19:21.959 --> 19:24.917
Mr. Kurland, you are not

19:21.959 --> 19:24.917
going to die out there.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.333
You are going to do

19:24.959 --> 19:27.333
exactly what I tell you.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.959
Now... take the nose

19:27.375 --> 19:29.959
of the shuttlecraft

19:30.000 --> 19:32.166
and aim it directly

19:30.000 --> 19:32.166
at Relva VII.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.500
But... aim it at Relva?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.166
I-I can't do that.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.166
That's crazy.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.500
Do it!

19:38.542 --> 19:39.709
But I'll burn up!

19:39.750 --> 19:41.917
28 seconds to impact.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.792
Jake, listen

19:41.959 --> 19:43.792
very carefully.

19:43.834 --> 19:47.792
This is Captain Picard,

19:43.834 --> 19:47.792
and I am giving you an order.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.667
Aim the shuttle at Relva.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.625
(<i> thudding</i> )

19:57.667 --> 20:00.166
Okay.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.166
It's done.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.500
Good.

20:01.542 --> 20:04.000
Now, monitor

20:01.542 --> 20:04.000
your speed exactly.

20:04.041 --> 20:06.792
When it hits .020,

20:06.834 --> 20:08.959
I want you

20:06.834 --> 20:08.959
to restart the engine,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.542
and when I tell you,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.542
pull up hard.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.542
.020 speed.

20:14.583 --> 20:17.792
Captain, I...

20:14.583 --> 20:17.792
I sure hope you're right.

20:17.834 --> 20:21.083
You'll just have

20:17.834 --> 20:21.083
to trust me.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.875
.003...

20:24.125 --> 20:25.834
.009...

20:25.875 --> 20:26.959
.012.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.542
Six seconds to impact.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.834
Hold on, Jake,

20:28.583 --> 20:30.834
it's going to be a little bumpy.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.125
.015...

20:33.834 --> 20:35.417
.019.

20:35.458 --> 20:37.000
Restart the engine, now.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.542
(<i> engine revving</i> )

20:39.583 --> 20:41.417
Pull up hard!

20:41.458 --> 20:43.291
(<i> loud clattering</i> )

20:43.333 --> 20:45.792
(<i> metallic screeching</i> )

20:57.250 --> 20:58.709
Yeah!

20:58.750 --> 21:01.166
Incredible, Captain.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.875
How did he do it?

21:02.375 --> 21:03.875
I-I thought...

21:03.917 --> 21:05.375
He built up

21:03.917 --> 21:05.375
enough speed and then

21:05.417 --> 21:07.166
bounced her off

21:05.417 --> 21:07.166
the atmosphere.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.542
Mr. Kurland?

21:10.583 --> 21:12.458
I assume you can

21:10.583 --> 21:12.458
maneuver it home.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.750
Yes, sir.

21:13.792 --> 21:17.000
Do it. Then report

21:13.792 --> 21:17.000
to Mr. Riker.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.792
Yes, sir.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.458
Very original, Captain.

21:23.500 --> 21:27.125
But how did that child acquire

21:23.500 --> 21:27.125
access to a shuttlecraft?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.583
Kurland is a

21:27.166 --> 21:28.583
highly qualified

21:28.625 --> 21:29.917
<i>Enterprise</i>

21:28.625 --> 21:29.917

21:29.959 --> 21:31.166
fully trained

21:29.959 --> 21:31.166
in many areas

21:31.208 --> 21:32.583
including shuttles.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.375
Did this "full training"

21:32.625 --> 21:35.375
include discipline?

21:36.834 --> 21:38.583
Mr. Remmick,

21:38.625 --> 21:41.500
young men sometimes

21:38.625 --> 21:41.500
make rash choices

21:41.542 --> 21:45.041
which is why Mr. Kurland

21:41.542 --> 21:45.041
will receive a strong refresher

21:45.083 --> 21:47.542
specifically in discipline.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.709
I'll note that

21:47.583 --> 21:49.709
in my report.

21:49.750 --> 21:53.583
Mm... full cooperation,

You! I have a package

22:07.125 --> 22:09.417

22:09.458 --> 22:10.792
Where is it?

22:10.834 --> 22:13.417
End of the corridor,

22:13.458 --> 22:15.417
Excuse me.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.500
You blocked my path.

22:17.542 --> 22:19.834
You Bulgallian

22:17.542 --> 22:19.834
sludge rat!

22:19.875 --> 22:21.041
I'm sorry.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.834
It was

22:21.083 --> 22:22.834
an honest mistake.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.041
I apologize.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.625
Is there a problem here,

22:24.083 --> 22:26.625
gentlemen?

22:26.667 --> 22:28.125
Uh, no, sir, I...

22:28.166 --> 22:30.000
Look, how dare you?!

22:30.041 --> 22:32.583
I am Rondon,

22:30.041 --> 22:32.583
you despicable

22:32.625 --> 22:34.041
Mellanoid

22:32.625 --> 22:34.041

22:34.083 --> 22:35.458
Liar!

22:35.500 --> 22:37.667
Who do you think

22:35.500 --> 22:37.667
you're bullying?!

22:37.709 --> 22:38.875
You bumped into me!

22:38.917 --> 22:40.125
It was<i> your</i> mistake!

22:40.166 --> 22:41.333
<i>You</i> were at fault!

22:41.375 --> 22:43.834
Do you want this

22:41.375 --> 22:43.834
to become violent?

22:50.667 --> 22:51.834
Friend...

22:51.875 --> 22:54.333
I like you.

22:58.667 --> 23:01.250
A very strange

22:58.667 --> 23:01.250
reaction.

23:01.291 --> 23:02.834
Not really.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.709
When he raised his hand,

23:02.875 --> 23:05.709
I saw that it was webbed--

23:05.750 --> 23:07.083
the sign of a Zaldan.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.875
But<i> you</i> became hostile.

23:08.917 --> 23:12.041
Zaldans are infuriated

23:08.917 --> 23:12.041
by courtesy.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.917
They view it as a form

23:12.083 --> 23:14.917
of phony social behavior

23:14.959 --> 23:16.542
designed to cover

23:14.959 --> 23:16.542
true feelings.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.875
Congratulations, Mr. Crusher.

23:19.917 --> 23:23.625
You handled that

23:19.917 --> 23:23.625
particular instant very well.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.125
Was this incident deliberate?

23:26.166 --> 23:29.250
It's important to know

23:26.166 --> 23:29.250
how you candidates

23:29.291 --> 23:31.250
deal with other cultures,

23:31.291 --> 23:32.875
other species.

23:32.917 --> 23:35.125
Then it was a test.

23:35.166 --> 23:36.291
Yes.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.041
Not all tests are

23:36.333 --> 23:38.041
announced

23:38.083 --> 23:41.417
or what

23:38.083 --> 23:41.417
they appear to be.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.542
Zaldans have webbed fingers.

23:51.792 --> 23:54.417
I wouldn't have passed.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.542
You're an android,

23:57.959 --> 23:59.542
correct?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.125
Yes, sir.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.125
And as an android,

24:01.166 --> 24:02.834
you are programmed to

24:01.166 --> 24:02.834
tell the entire truth?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.709
Yes, sir.

24:05.750 --> 24:09.291
There is a problem with

24:05.750 --> 24:09.291
this ship, Mr. Data.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.875
It's in the records.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.834
Somewhere.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.667
I need your help

24:13.875 --> 24:16.667
to find it.

24:16.709 --> 24:19.125
All of the ship's records

24:16.709 --> 24:19.125
are available to you, sir.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.500
But this information

24:19.166 --> 24:23.500
is very cleverly hidden.

24:23.542 --> 24:26.875
Your captain is not

24:23.542 --> 24:26.875
what he appears to be.

24:26.917 --> 24:29.333
Do not forget that you

24:26.917 --> 24:29.333
have loyalty to Starfleet

24:29.375 --> 24:31.709
above all else.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.917
Loyalty is not

24:31.750 --> 24:33.917
the issue, Commander.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.667
There is nothing wrong

24:33.959 --> 24:36.667
with Captain Picard

24:36.709 --> 24:38.250
or the ship's logs.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.750
Therefore, there must be

24:38.291 --> 24:39.750
something wrong

24:39.792 --> 24:41.166
with your

24:39.792 --> 24:41.166
original assumption.

24:41.208 --> 24:44.333
That is not acceptable,

24:41.208 --> 24:44.333
Mr. Data.

24:44.375 --> 24:47.500
Acceptable or not, sir...

24:47.542 --> 24:49.083
it is the truth.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.709
Just how did

24:50.625 --> 24:52.709
this contaminate

24:52.750 --> 24:55.291
get aboard the ship?

24:55.333 --> 24:56.709
(<i> beep</i> )

24:56.750 --> 25:00.417
By accident, sir.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.542
Meaning Captain Picard

25:02.583 --> 25:06.125
has no standing procedure

25:02.583 --> 25:06.125
for this type of situation?

25:06.166 --> 25:07.250
No.

25:07.291 --> 25:10.333
Meaning by<i> accident...</i> sir.

25:10.375 --> 25:13.583
You don't like me

25:10.375 --> 25:13.583
very much, do you?

25:13.625 --> 25:16.875
Is it required, sir?

25:20.125 --> 25:23.959
How would you characterize

25:24.000 --> 25:28.375
your relationship

25:24.000 --> 25:28.375
with Captain Picard?

25:28.417 --> 25:29.834
We're Starfleet officers

25:29.875 --> 25:32.667
who've known each other

25:29.875 --> 25:32.667
for many years.

25:32.709 --> 25:36.709
Everything said here

25:32.709 --> 25:36.709
is confidential, Doctor.

25:36.750 --> 25:40.041
You can be completely

25:36.750 --> 25:40.041
open with me.

25:40.083 --> 25:42.083
About what?

25:43.750 --> 25:47.417
About how you feel

25:43.750 --> 25:47.417
serving with the man...

25:47.458 --> 25:49.041
who is responsible

25:49.083 --> 25:50.792
for the death

25:49.083 --> 25:50.792
of your husband.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.458
(<i> chuckles softly</i> )

25:59.875 --> 26:03.375
My personal feelings

25:59.875 --> 26:03.375
about Captain Picard

26:03.417 --> 26:06.542
are irrelevant

26:03.417 --> 26:06.542
to this investigation

26:06.583 --> 26:10.709
and none of your business.

26:10.750 --> 26:14.375
Then you confirm

26:10.750 --> 26:14.375
the accuracy of the log report?

26:14.417 --> 26:17.375
You violated the Prime Directive

26:14.417 --> 26:17.375
of the Edo.

26:17.417 --> 26:20.583
You deliberately

26:17.417 --> 26:20.583
interfered with their laws.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.250
Yes. It is exactly

26:20.625 --> 26:23.250
as I explained it

26:23.291 --> 26:24.792
in the log records.

26:24.834 --> 26:28.333
All to save

26:24.834 --> 26:28.333
Dr. Crusher's son.

26:28.375 --> 26:31.291
A member of my crew was

26:28.375 --> 26:31.291
being held unjustly.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.875
I stand by my decision.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.375
(<i> beep</i> )

26:37.417 --> 26:40.583
Mr. Remmick, you've talked

26:37.417 --> 26:40.583
to every member of this ship.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.375
I think you've had

26:40.625 --> 26:42.375
enough time to find out

26:42.417 --> 26:44.000
whatever it is

26:42.417 --> 26:44.000
you're looking for.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.667
Are you afraid

26:44.041 --> 26:45.667
if I keep looking,

26:45.709 --> 26:47.750
I'll find that you're guilty?

26:55.125 --> 26:56.458
The only thing

26:55.125 --> 26:56.458
I'm guilty of

26:56.500 --> 26:59.291
is allowing this charade

26:56.500 --> 26:59.291
to go on so long.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.542
Admiral, if it is me

27:07.583 --> 27:09.542
you're investigating,

27:09.583 --> 27:13.250
ask me directly what

27:09.583 --> 27:13.250
it is you want to know.

27:13.291 --> 27:16.667
And please tell me

27:13.291 --> 27:16.667
exactly what is going on.

27:16.709 --> 27:18.500
I need a little more time,

27:16.709 --> 27:18.500
Jean-Luc.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.083
How much time?

27:20.125 --> 27:22.583
I won't tolerate my crew

27:20.125 --> 27:22.583
being harassed any longer.

27:22.625 --> 27:25.291
Remmick's full report

27:22.625 --> 27:25.291
is almost ready.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.709
I want to be here

27:25.333 --> 27:26.709
when he presents it.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.917
That has always

27:26.750 --> 27:28.917
been my intention.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.875
Commander Remmick,

27:31.250 --> 27:33.875
report to Admiral Quinn.

27:33.917 --> 27:37.208
On my way, sir.

27:37.250 --> 27:39.583
This has been a strain

27:37.250 --> 27:39.583
on our friendship.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.000
I know.

27:41.041 --> 27:44.583
Believe me, Jean-Luc,

27:41.041 --> 27:44.583
I regret that.

27:44.625 --> 27:48.208
But it has been necessary.

27:49.750 --> 27:52.625
(<i> rhythmic computer beeping</i> )

27:58.083 --> 28:01.208
(<i> high-pitched chirping</i> )

28:16.041 --> 28:18.291
I can't get it.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.709
Yes, you can.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.750
Don't fight it.

28:21.792 --> 28:24.500
Relax into it,

28:21.792 --> 28:24.500
and let it come by itself.

28:24.542 --> 28:26.500
No, it's going too fast.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.917
Wesley, I can't do it.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.333
Yes, you can.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.750
You've got your

28:31.375 --> 28:32.750
rotation factor.

28:32.792 --> 28:35.333
Just put in

28:32.792 --> 28:35.333
your vector coordinates.

28:53.667 --> 28:55.000
COMPUTER:

28:53.667 --> 28:55.000
Time elapsed.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.875
(<i> door opens</i> )

29:00.041 --> 29:01.625
Congratulations, Mordock.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.709
That was the second

29:01.667 --> 29:03.709
fastest time

29:03.750 --> 29:05.000
ever recorded on this test.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.375
You all did well.

29:07.417 --> 29:08.583
MORDOCK:

29:07.417 --> 29:08.583
No.

29:08.625 --> 29:11.000
It should not have been

29:08.625 --> 29:11.000
that way.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.250
Mr. Crusher helped me.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.458
Yes, I know.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.333
An interesting choice,

29:15.500 --> 29:18.333
Mr. Crusher--

29:18.375 --> 29:21.667
especially considering how close

29:18.375 --> 29:21.667
you and Mr. Mordock are

29:21.709 --> 29:23.208
in overall score.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.667
You all have an hour

29:25.709 --> 29:28.041
to prepare for your last test.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.500
WESLEY:

29:28.083 --> 29:29.500
The psych test, sir?

29:32.500 --> 29:36.250
We prefer to think of it

29:32.500 --> 29:36.250
as a psychological evaluation

29:36.291 --> 29:39.959
based on reactions to various

29:36.291 --> 29:39.959
individual problems,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.583
but, uh,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.583
"psych test" will do.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.792
Sir?

29:54.834 --> 29:57.500
Please sit down,

29:54.834 --> 29:57.500
Mr. Remmick.

30:01.208 --> 30:03.625
Proceed with your report.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.750
Admiral, I've done

30:03.667 --> 30:05.750
my best to be thorough

30:05.792 --> 30:08.417
during this

30:05.792 --> 30:08.417
investigation.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.125
Continue.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.291
I couldn't find

30:10.166 --> 30:12.291
what you asked for, sir.

30:13.834 --> 30:16.333
I spoke to officer

30:13.834 --> 30:16.333
after officer,

30:16.375 --> 30:18.208
a-at length, I...

30:18.250 --> 30:19.792
pried into

30:18.250 --> 30:19.792
the ship's logs,

30:19.834 --> 30:21.959
and yet I could find

30:19.834 --> 30:21.959
nothing wrong--

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
except, perhaps a...

30:24.041 --> 30:26.458
casual familiarity

30:24.041 --> 30:26.458
among the bridge crew,

30:26.500 --> 30:30.333
but mostly that comes from

30:26.500 --> 30:30.333
a sense of teamwork...

30:33.834 --> 30:36.667
...and a feeling of family.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.250
I'm sorry, sir.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.875
I did my best.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.417
Quite.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.750
You're dismissed,

30:43.750 --> 30:45.750
Commander.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.125
Yes, sir.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.000
Captain Picard.

30:55.834 --> 30:57.834
My tour in the Inspector

30:55.834 --> 30:57.834
General's office

30:57.875 --> 30:59.959
will be up in six months.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.166
When I'm finished...

31:03.208 --> 31:05.458
this is where

31:03.208 --> 31:05.458
I'd like to serve, sir.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.166
Don't judge the young man

31:16.208 --> 31:18.166
too harshly.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.542
He's a good officer.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.500
It's not him I'm

31:20.583 --> 31:22.500
inclined to judge.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.542
Don't judge me

31:22.542 --> 31:24.542
too harshly, either,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.125
until I've finished.

31:26.166 --> 31:29.083
We had to be

31:26.166 --> 31:29.083
very sure of you.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.291
Some of us

31:29.125 --> 31:31.291
at Starfleet Command

31:31.333 --> 31:35.625
became suspicious of certain

31:31.333 --> 31:35.625
problems in the Federation.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.041
What kind of problems?

31:37.083 --> 31:39.125
Someone or something

31:37.083 --> 31:39.125
is trying to destroy

31:39.166 --> 31:40.500
the fabric

31:39.166 --> 31:40.500
of everything

31:40.542 --> 31:43.792
we've built up

31:40.542 --> 31:43.792
in the last 200 years.

31:43.834 --> 31:44.834
What's your evidence?

31:44.875 --> 31:46.166
I can't go into that.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.333
There are

31:46.208 --> 31:48.333
too many people involved.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.125
What do you want from me?

31:50.166 --> 31:52.959
I don't know whether the threat

31:50.166 --> 31:52.959
comes from the inside,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.750
or whether it's from outside.

31:55.792 --> 31:57.834
I need people I can trust

31:57.875 --> 32:00.083
in strong positions

31:57.875 --> 32:00.083
throughout the Federation.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.125
You have my complete

32:00.125 --> 32:02.125
support, you know that.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.250
That's not enough.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.375
I want to promote you

32:04.291 --> 32:06.375
to admiral,

32:06.417 --> 32:11.000
and I want you to take over as

32:06.417 --> 32:11.000
commandant of Starfleet Academy.

32:12.709 --> 32:14.000
The Academy?

32:14.041 --> 32:15.333
Yes.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.959
The Academy?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.083
I need you close.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.291
Then there was<i> never</i> a problem

32:30.125 --> 32:32.291
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

32:32.333 --> 32:34.208
No.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.041
But I had to be sure

32:34.250 --> 32:37.041
you hadn't been co-opted.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.083
(<i> snickers</i> )

32:39.125 --> 32:41.250
Then, Greg, uh...

32:41.291 --> 32:43.875
this is...

32:43.917 --> 32:46.667
politics,

32:43.917 --> 32:46.667
and, uh...

32:46.709 --> 32:47.917
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

32:47.959 --> 32:49.625
...I, uh...

32:49.667 --> 32:51.792
I'm not good

32:49.667 --> 32:51.792
at politics.

32:51.834 --> 32:55.000
Surely there are others

32:51.834 --> 32:55.000
who are better suited.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.417
All right.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.041
Even if I am wrong,

32:56.458 --> 32:59.041
and I hope I am,

32:59.083 --> 33:00.875
you're still the best man

32:59.083 --> 33:00.875
for the job.

33:00.917 --> 33:03.667
I appreciate the value

33:00.917 --> 33:03.667
of what you're offering.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.500
It's not a decision

33:05.583 --> 33:07.500
I can make quickly.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.625
I need an answer soon.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.667
All right.

33:13.709 --> 33:15.917
You'll have it tonight,

33:13.709 --> 33:15.917
Admiral.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.000
Thank you.

33:34.417 --> 33:38.750
Mr. Mordock will be finished

33:34.417 --> 33:38.750
with his psych test momentarily.

33:43.041 --> 33:45.834
WESLEY:

33:43.041 --> 33:45.834
Mordock?

33:47.208 --> 33:48.333
Are you all right?

33:49.709 --> 33:51.583
I will be.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.500
Mr. Crusher.

33:57.542 --> 33:59.709
You're next.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.417
Good luck.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.500
I'm here.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.667
I'm ready.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.458
Maybe they forgot.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.709
Breathe.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.667
Got to remember to breathe.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.500
(<i> panting</i> )

36:51.166 --> 36:52.291
Officer Chang, there's...

36:52.333 --> 36:53.291
Wesley!

36:53.333 --> 36:54.959
It's all right.

36:59.792 --> 37:01.000
Thanks.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.709
An excellent performance,

37:03.083 --> 37:05.709
Mr. Crusher.

37:10.166 --> 37:11.500
Performance?

37:13.625 --> 37:15.959
That was the test.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.333
Yes.

37:17.375 --> 37:20.500
A man could have died.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.125
Theoretically, yes.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.500
You had to make

37:22.166 --> 37:24.500
a choice, and you did.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.333
There's no right or wrong

37:24.542 --> 37:27.333
about it.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.875
Your greatest fear has been that

37:27.375 --> 37:30.875
you couldn't make that decision.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.792
Because of my father?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.792
Because Capt...

37:36.667 --> 37:40.834
Because someone made

37:36.667 --> 37:40.834
that choice...

37:40.875 --> 37:42.917
and my father died.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.500
Sir?

38:01.542 --> 38:03.083
Yes, Number One?

38:03.125 --> 38:05.417
Mr. Remmick

38:03.125 --> 38:05.417
has left the ship.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.208
Yes.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.625
He found nothing wrong

38:07.250 --> 38:09.625
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

38:09.667 --> 38:11.291
And you can inform the crew

38:11.333 --> 38:13.834
that Admiral Quinn

38:11.333 --> 38:13.834
is most impressed.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.125
Thank you.

38:15.166 --> 38:18.041
They'll be pleased to hear that.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.792
Can you explain now

38:18.083 --> 38:19.792
what he was after?

38:19.834 --> 38:22.417
They were after me,

38:19.834 --> 38:22.417
Number One.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.083
They want me

38:22.458 --> 38:24.083
to take over

38:24.125 --> 38:27.250
as commandant,

38:24.125 --> 38:27.250
Starfleet Academy.

38:27.291 --> 38:29.583
Congratulations.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.250
What a wonderful choice, sir.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.583
You'll be able

38:31.291 --> 38:32.583
to shape the minds

38:32.625 --> 38:34.667
of the future leaders

38:32.625 --> 38:34.667
of Starfleet.

38:39.291 --> 38:41.417
You haven't decided

38:39.291 --> 38:41.417
what you're going to do.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.750
Yes, I have, Number One.

38:43.792 --> 38:45.917
I've decided

38:43.792 --> 38:45.917
I'm going for a walk.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.709
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

38:54.125 --> 38:56.417
I'm proud of all of you.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.625
You've done

38:56.458 --> 38:58.625
a superb job.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.583
Each of you would make

39:00.625 --> 39:03.166
a fine

39:00.625 --> 39:03.166
Starfleet officer.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.834
It's unfair that only

39:03.208 --> 39:05.834
one candidate from Relva

39:05.875 --> 39:08.083
will attend the Academy

39:05.875 --> 39:08.083
this year...

39:08.125 --> 39:10.542
and a loss

39:08.125 --> 39:10.542
to the Federation

39:10.583 --> 39:14.417
if the rest of you do not

39:10.583 --> 39:14.417
return to test again.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.291
Mr. Mordock will be

39:16.000 --> 39:18.291
the candidate.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.125
His results were

39:18.333 --> 39:20.125
slightly higher

39:20.166 --> 39:21.959
than Mr. Crusher's.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.125
Congratulations,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.125
Mr. Mordock.

39:24.166 --> 39:27.125
You're the first Benzite

39:24.166 --> 39:27.125
in Starfleet.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.625
Thank you, sir,

39:27.166 --> 39:29.625
but it's not right.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.709
It shouldn't be me.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.291
Wesley lost points

39:31.750 --> 39:34.291
because he helped me.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.709
He should not be punished

39:34.333 --> 39:36.709
for his generosity.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.083
He wasn't.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.875
He lost time,

39:38.125 --> 39:40.875
but it wasn't only that.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.583
Candidates, thank you.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.500
And good luck.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.375
I am sorry, Wesley.

39:54.417 --> 39:57.709
It's okay. You

39:54.417 --> 39:57.709
deserve to win.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.917
Besides, you would have

39:57.750 --> 39:59.917
done the same for me.

40:03.583 --> 40:07.250
Yes. I believe I would.

40:07.291 --> 40:08.917
Congratulations.

40:12.709 --> 40:15.792
Well, personally,

40:12.709 --> 40:15.792
I hate losing.

40:15.834 --> 40:17.875
So you'd better be ready

40:15.834 --> 40:17.875
next year, Wesley.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.542
I won't be

40:17.917 --> 40:19.542
easy to beat.

40:36.542 --> 40:38.500
Mr. Kurland.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.875
Yes, sir.

40:44.917 --> 40:47.125
Are you, uh...

40:47.166 --> 40:48.917
feeling better?

40:50.166 --> 40:51.375
Yes, sir.

40:51.417 --> 40:52.667
Look, I-I'm sorry

40:52.709 --> 40:55.166
I-I damaged

40:52.709 --> 40:55.166
the shuttle, Captain.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.834
But Mr. Riker said

40:55.208 --> 40:56.834
I can work on fixing it

40:56.875 --> 40:58.792
as part of my

40:56.875 --> 40:58.792
discipline training.

40:58.834 --> 41:00.333
Good idea. I hope

40:58.834 --> 41:00.333
you've learned

41:00.375 --> 41:02.375
that running away

41:00.375 --> 41:02.375
solves nothing.

41:02.417 --> 41:05.500
Oh, yes, sir.

41:05.542 --> 41:08.291
And I-I am sorry

41:05.542 --> 41:08.291
I messed up.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.166
But at least

41:08.333 --> 41:11.166
you kept your wits

41:08.333 --> 41:11.166
about you out there.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.542
Don't forget that.

41:12.583 --> 41:15.083
No, sir.

41:15.125 --> 41:17.542
And thank you.

41:17.583 --> 41:20.083
Thank you for-for...

41:20.125 --> 41:21.875
for saving my life.

41:21.917 --> 41:24.208
That's my job,

41:21.917 --> 41:24.208
young man.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.250
Yes, sir.

41:44.417 --> 41:46.375
Mr. Crusher?

41:46.417 --> 41:47.750
Why aren't you in

41:46.417 --> 41:47.750
your dress uniform

41:47.792 --> 41:49.542
for Admiral Quinn's

41:47.792 --> 41:49.542
farewell dinner?

41:53.375 --> 41:55.625
I didn't think that would be

41:53.375 --> 41:55.625
appropriate, sir.

41:55.667 --> 41:57.959
Why not?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.041
I failed, Captain.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.291
I didn't get into

42:01.083 --> 42:03.291
the Academy.

42:03.333 --> 42:06.959
I failed you,

42:03.333 --> 42:06.959
and I failed the<i> Enterprise.</i>

42:07.000 --> 42:08.875
Ridiculous.

42:12.083 --> 42:14.291
Did you do your best?

42:14.333 --> 42:16.333
Yes.

42:16.375 --> 42:17.834
When you test

42:16.375 --> 42:17.834
next year--

42:17.875 --> 42:19.500
and you will

42:17.875 --> 42:19.500
test next year--

42:19.542 --> 42:21.291
do you think your

42:19.542 --> 42:21.291
performance will improve?

42:22.583 --> 42:23.875
Yes.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.208
Good.

42:26.250 --> 42:29.000
The only person you are truly

42:26.250 --> 42:29.000
competing against, Wesley,

42:29.041 --> 42:30.375
is yourself.

42:32.041 --> 42:33.417
Then you're not

42:32.041 --> 42:33.417
disappointed?

42:37.333 --> 42:40.542
Wesley,

42:37.333 --> 42:40.542
you have to measure

42:40.583 --> 42:44.125
your successes and

42:40.583 --> 42:44.125
your failures within--

42:44.166 --> 42:47.625
not by anything

42:44.166 --> 42:47.625
that I or anyone

42:44.166 --> 42:47.625
else might think.

42:47.667 --> 42:50.917
But, um...

42:50.959 --> 42:54.917
if it helps you

42:50.959 --> 42:54.917
to know this...

42:54.959 --> 42:56.375
I failed

42:54.959 --> 42:56.375
the first time,

42:56.417 --> 42:59.166
and you may not

42:56.417 --> 42:59.166
tell anyone.

42:59.208 --> 43:01.583
You?!

43:01.625 --> 43:02.667
You failed?

43:02.709 --> 43:05.166
Yes, but not

43:02.709 --> 43:05.166
the second time.

43:07.333 --> 43:08.625
Now...

43:09.917 --> 43:11.208
you, uh, do me

43:09.917 --> 43:11.208
the courtesy

43:11.250 --> 43:13.917
of joining us

43:11.250 --> 43:13.917
at dinner.

43:13.959 --> 43:16.417
I have to disappoint

43:13.959 --> 43:16.417
an old friend.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.208
Wish I could convince you

43:25.000 --> 43:28.208
to change your mind.

43:28.250 --> 43:30.291
I'll serve you

43:28.250 --> 43:30.291
better here.

43:30.333 --> 43:33.625
This is where

43:30.333 --> 43:33.625
you belong.

43:33.667 --> 43:34.834
If you should

43:33.667 --> 43:34.834
need me...

43:34.875 --> 43:37.083
I've been playing

43:34.875 --> 43:37.083
politics too long.

43:37.125 --> 43:40.625
Perhaps I see

43:37.125 --> 43:40.625
conspiracies everywhere.

43:40.667 --> 43:42.250
Don't worry.

43:45.625 --> 43:47.583
Safe travels, my friend.

44:04.083 --> 44:06.583
Set course for Algeron IV,

44:04.083 --> 44:06.583
Mr. Crusher.

44:06.625 --> 44:09.750
(<i> beeping</i> )

44:09.792 --> 44:13.000
Course plotted

44:09.792 --> 44:13.000
and laid in, sir.

44:13.041 --> 44:15.166
Then shall we continue

44:13.041 --> 44:15.166
with our mission?

44:16.625 --> 44:19.208
Yes, sir.

44:19.250 --> 44:20.959
Excellent.

44:23.959 --> 44:26.625
Mr. Crusher...

44:26.667 --> 44:28.458
engage.
