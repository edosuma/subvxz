00:02.600 --> 00:05.000
Anomalies are starting to appear.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.200
Doorways in time...

00:07.200 --> 00:09.200
to worlds we can barely imagine.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.400
The anomalies are conclusive
proof that the past exists.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.400
In a fourth dimension is real and
solid as those we already know.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.000
Our job is to predict and contain them.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.400
Helen Cutter came
to this area eight years ago.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.800
She disappeared in the forest,
but her body was never found.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.200
Helen!

00:33.200 --> 00:34.400
Helen is alive!

00:34.400 --> 00:37.000
She is waiting you in the
other side of the anomaly.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.600
Where are you, Helen?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

02:23.600 --> 02:25.200
Anthony?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.800
The magnetic field is remaining
consistent about 5 Tesla.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.600
At this point there's
no sign of deterioration.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.800
Let me demonstrate.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.400
Who's that idiot?

02:50.600 --> 02:54.600
Connor Temple. He looks like a half-wit,
but he has a very good brain.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.800
Bull's eye!

02:58.600 --> 03:00.000
It kills me every time!

03:00.200 --> 03:02.400
We may stand
on the brink of Armageddon.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.000
But at least we have
an irritating student on our side.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.400
- How reassuring.
- Is this thing still on?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.200
The previous
anomaly proved to be temporary.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.400
As you've just heard
this one shows no sign of weakening.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.200
The anomalies may be intermittent.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.800
And they fade from time to time
but they never completely disappear.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
If that were true, creatures
would have come through it before.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.400
Maybe they have.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.000
Ancient civilizations spoke
of monsters and dragons.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.200
Perhaps they
weren't as naive as we assumed.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.800
The anomalies are conclusive
proof that the past exists.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
In a fourth dimension as
real and solid as those we already know.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.400
Our job is to predict and contain them.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.400
- We need to establish-
- Thank you, Professor.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.200
We'll take this from here.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.800
The professor is speaking
in an independent capacity.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.600
Official policy has yet to be finalized.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
It appears we may have another one.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You really can't remember a thing?

04:04.000 --> 04:08.200
Not a thing after I went into the tunnels.
Probably for the best though, right?

04:08.400 --> 04:11.600
Still, they say it should be
only short term, so... you know?

04:12.200 --> 04:14.200
It’s all been pretty scary, hasn’t it?

04:14.600 --> 04:17.200
You know, it's not until
you got bitten, that I though that...

04:17.399 --> 04:19.399
one of us might actually die
from doing this.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.800
It really upset me.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
- You must have gone through hell!
- Yeah.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.200
It did make me think
about what's important though.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.800
You know?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Sorts out your priorities a bit.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
If you get killed, can I get you iPod?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.000
Is that perfume?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
I can do the girl thing, you know?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.000
You look really good.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.600
Thanks.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.400
It's good of you both to come,
but you shouldn't have bothered.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.200
Don't flatter yourself.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.400
Some of us just
like to hang out with nurses.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.800
Come on, I'll give you a lift home.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.000
Oh, there's no need.
My girlfriend is picking me up.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.800
Girlfriend?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Allison. She's been in the rainforest
for 2 years researching infectious diseases.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.800
As long as she's not one of those girls
that brings the work home with her.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.400
You must have missed her.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.200
Yeah.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.600
I'd better go. Bye.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.000
Two years?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.800
How much sex are they
gonna have over the next few days!

05:30.600 --> 05:32.000
Sorry.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.600
It's alright.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.400
Well, so much for the girl thing.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.800
I think you look great.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.600
It's pretty obvious she killed her boyfriend
but we don't know what she did the body.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.400
Just keeps babbling on
about monsters and sea serpents.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.400
Would you allow me to talk with her?

05:56.400 --> 05:59.000
What about? Monsters?
I’m conducting a serious...

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
- ...murder investigation here-
- Look, there's no murder.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.200
Anthony Barton was killed
by an ancient marine predator...

06:04.200 --> 06:08.400
which then returned to its
home millions of years in the past.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.200
Who are you people?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.800
I'm sorry.
Thanks for your time, inspector.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.400
Cutter, wait!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.400
- The girl's innocent.
- I know.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.600
We can't let her go to jail
for something she didn't do.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.000
Leave that with me.
I'll do what I can for her.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.000
With all this chlorine in the pool I'm
surprised the creature even came through.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.200
To a reptile it would have been
like swimming in a bucket of acid.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.800
Yeah, it probably sensed the danger and
got out fast before the anomaly closed.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.800
So... how's Allison?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.600
Jet-lagged.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.800
You see, it’s funny, because you always
gave the impression like you were single.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.400
That's funny. I didn't think I was
giving any impression whatsoever.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.200
You'd be surprised.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.800
Connor. I'm flattered.
But you're really not my type.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.200
- Police charged Diane Johnson
- I know.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
- We have to intervene!
- We're not gonna do that.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.200
- Why not?
- Because I won't allow the story...

07:06.200 --> 07:08.400
to become public property.
At least in prison...

07:08.400 --> 07:10.000
the newspapers can't get hold of her.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.800
So you're just going to let them
lock up an innocent traumatised girl.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.800
Of course it's undesirable...

07:14.800 --> 07:17.600
but it would be far worst to release
her to cause panic and disorder.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.800
I'll see that the charges are dropped
when the immediate crisis is under control.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.400
That could take months!

07:22.400 --> 07:25.200
And would you rather tell the police
that an ancient sea monster...

07:25.400 --> 07:28.200
is cruising our swimming pools
consuming lifeguards?

07:29.400 --> 07:32.600
I know the injustice stinks, but...

07:32.800 --> 07:35.000
the correct decision is often painful.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.800
That's the burden of government.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.200
Well, the DNA is conclusive.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.800
It's the boy from the swimming pool.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.800
Or what's left of him.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.200
That's a bolus.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.200
A regurgitated mass of flesh and bone.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.200
The beast swallowed him whole and
then vomited up what it couldn’t digest.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.000
What type of creature could
have done this to him?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.600
What you should be asking
yourself is how the remains of a boy...

08:39.600 --> 08:42.799
who was attacked in the swimming pool
ended up 20 miles away in a reservoir.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.200
Maybe there never was an anomaly.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.200
Maybe the girl murdered her
boyfriend in the swimming pool...

08:49.400 --> 08:50.800
and dumped his body in the reservoir.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.800
Very likely, provided you also believe
she swallowed him whole and then...

08:53.800 --> 08:57.200
drove 20 miles down the
motorway to regurgitate his remains.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.600
All right, then you explain it.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.000
We know it's the same beast
in the pool and the reservoir.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.200
Perhaps the anomaly
has a fixed point of origin in the past.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.800
Yet, somehow
it remains fluid in our time.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.600
They don't just open. They move.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.000
- How are you?
- All right.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.600
We haven't found anything yet.
No creature, no anomaly, no nothing.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.600
They're still searching the reservoir, but
with any luck. The anomaly's closed again.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.000
I need detailed local maps.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.600
Lists of swimming pools, rivers,
lakes, anything nearby.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.000
- Can you get those for me?
- Should I be asking why?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.800
Just an idea.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.600
Do you know what I miss?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.400
Those soul-crushingly
dull civil service meetings,

10:05.400 --> 10:08.400
that made suicide look like
an exciting career option.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.800
I used to sit there praying
something would happen in my life.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Careful what you wish for.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.600
Professor!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.400
You're really gonna want to see this.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
The reservoir is land-locked, right?

10:27.000 --> 10:27.800
Yes.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.200
So allowing for condensation and rainfall,
the depth should be pretty consistent.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.600
Yes.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, I made this mark
at water level earlier.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.400
The water level's
fallen 40 centimetres since then.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.600
This isn't a reservoir
anymore, it's a tidal lake.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.800
The water's literally pouring out of it.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.200
It must be flowing out
through the anomaly.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.000
Which means
it's still down there, somewhere.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.600
Here you are.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.200
Thanks very much.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.000
Thinking about Helen?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.800
How do you know that?

11:30.600 --> 11:34.600
Highly trained civil servant. We're
famous for our emotional empathy.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
Whatever I'm doing, she's always
there. She never really goes away.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.400
It's strange.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.600
Of all the people in the world to
hallucinate about, Stephen chose Helen.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.600
Steam.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.000
Don't you see?

11:57.200 --> 12:00.800
The tide must be coming in, bringing in
warmer water from the other side.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.200
The steam is telling us
exactly where the anomaly is.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.800
I suppose there's no point
in asking you not to go down with them.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.800
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I'm not,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.400
I was thinking of all the paperwork
I will have to do if you drown.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
You've no idea how many
forms I'd have to fill in.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.400
What if you're right and
the creature's still down there?

12:25.400 --> 12:26.600
We'll find it.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.600
All right.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.600
See, why does Stephen
get all the fun stuff to do...

12:37.600 --> 12:39.200
while we get stuck
collecting water samples?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.000
He looks better on a wet suit.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.400
That’s debateable. I could do the
action stuff as well, you know?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm not just a massive intellect.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
He doesn't remember a thing,
you know? Stephen.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.000
That's not the point.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.400
He knew what he was doing when he
asked me out, he knew he had a girlfriend.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.800
Yeah, and he had also just been
poisoned by a giant centipede,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.800
that might have
affected his judgement just a little bit.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.800
What am I saying? You know,
you're right, he's a two-timing weasel...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.800
and maybe you should put that
down to experience and move on.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
You know, there's
plenty more fish in the sea.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.800
Abby?

14:22.200 --> 14:23.800
What's that?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.400
Don't move!

15:57.400 --> 15:58.400
Go!

15:59.600 --> 16:01.000
Quickly, Abby!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.200
Jump! You're okay?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.600
Move there!

16:23.800 --> 16:25.000
No back!

16:25.000 --> 16:26.400
Connor! Careful!

17:18.599 --> 17:20.200
Some kind of mosasaur.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.800
Maybe six or seven metres.
Cretaceous, at a guess.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.200
Scary.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.200
And at that size,
it couldn’t have been fully-grown.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.400
- "Take deep breaths."
- Yeah.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.800
Which is just as well for you.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.000
They’re all really
upset about losing the diver.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.800
Tell me exactly what happened.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
He swam through right in front of me.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.600
He should have been
able to make it back through.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.400
Something must have stopped him.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.000
Are you absolutely
certain the anomaly’s closed?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.400
Straight after
the mosasaur went back through.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.000
The water temperature’s
already returned to normal.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.400
Then we’ve lost him.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
You saved my life.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.000
I did, didn’t I?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.000
- Okay
- What?

18:17.600 --> 18:20.200
- You can let go now.
- Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. I just…

18:21.600 --> 18:22.800
Thanks.

18:26.800 --> 18:31.400
The anomalies are times
equivalent of an earthquake.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.400
Strong enough to rip apart
the boundaries between dimensions.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.800
My guess is that the fault line...

18:40.200 --> 18:42.600
ruptured at the swimming pool,

18:42.800 --> 18:45.200
then ran to the reservoir.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.200
It could crash its way
through into our time again...

18:49.200 --> 18:52.000
anywhere along this line.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.200
Earthquakes? Temporal fault lines?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.600
Are we trying a little too hard people?

18:57.600 --> 19:00.200
It’s random chance, that’s all.
There’s no connection with any of it.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
Try to look on the bright side, Cutter.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.800
The anomaly’s gone, the crisis is over
and I’d say we got off pretty lightly.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.800
Except that a good man in now
permanently marooned in the past.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.000
There could be another breach along
the fault line at any given moment.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.000
You should be stationing troops
at every significant body of water...

19:16.000 --> 19:17.800
between the reservoir and the coast.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.800
The press would be crawling all over us in
seconds. How on Earth would we explain it?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.800
- You admit that it’s all conjecture.
- Yes, of course it is,

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
but I’m right.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.000
You people, you’re worse
than the climate change mob.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.200
One cold day in July
and suddenly it’s the new Ice Age.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.800
You’re making a mistake.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
If and when
the anomaly breaks through again,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.800
I guarantee you...

19:40.800 --> 19:43.000
it will be somewhere along this line.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.800
Okay, guys. Ten minutes before school.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.000
Mosasaur, right?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.800
Cretaceous era marine predator.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.000
Anything from 2 to 20 meters
in length and two tonnes in weight.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.200
Extinct 65 million years ago.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.800
I was reading that.
What’s this? A new project?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.000
No. No, no, no, just interested.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.000
Oh, is that the time?
I’m going to have to go.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.200
Whoa, what’s the rush?

21:47.400 --> 21:48.800
It’s DVD night.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.000
‘Battlefield Earth’,
director’s commentaries.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.600
Your turn to get the pizza.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.400
Right.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.600
You know what?
You can have it on me.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.400
I’ve really got to be somewhere.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.200
What’s got into him?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
Maybe he’s still angry
over our practical joke.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.600
Come on. That fake
dinosaur was a masterpiece.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.200
Yeah. Perhaps he’s got a girlfriend.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.000
Well, it must be pretty radical.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.400
He missed my Gerry Anderson
marathon last weekend as well.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.600
- Said he wasn’t interested.
- How weird is that?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.200
Why the sudden obsession with dinosaurs?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.600
Maybe he’s onto something.
A dig somewhere,

22:25.600 --> 22:28.000
a good fossil, something
he wants to keep to himself.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.800
Which would be selfish.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.200
You know, I think we need
to keep a closer eye on that boy.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.200
Helen.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.000
Come on, let’s go.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.600
I’ve been remembering things.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.200
You mean Helen?

23:16.200 --> 23:18.000
Why didn’t you tell anyone?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.600
- Did you go looking for her?
- Look, if she wanted to talk to me...

23:20.600 --> 23:23.600
then she could have.
Why keep playing games with me?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
You mean this isn’t the first time?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
- How long have you known she was alive?
- Look, not long.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.600
But all these years,
she let me think she was dead.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
She let me go through that.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.200
What does that tell you?

23:38.400 --> 23:41.600
Come on, there could be all kinds
of reasons why she stayed away.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
The point is she wants to see you now.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.000
- She left you to die on your own.
- Maybe she thought help was coming.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.800
Maybe she didn’t care.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.600
You think I don’t
want to know what happened?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.200
I’ve thought
of nothing else for eight years.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.400
But what if…

23:59.000 --> 24:01.400
What if the
truth is worse than not knowing?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.600
Are you going to tell the others?

24:07.400 --> 24:10.200
No, it’s not my call.
But if she was my wife,

24:10.200 --> 24:13.200
- I’d go through a million anomalies.
- Yeah, but she isn’t, is she?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
But she was important to me too.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.000
I know that.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.600
Are you coming?

24:33.200 --> 24:36.400
I thought you said you got a leak in the
washing machine. Not an indoor pool.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.200
Can you stop it?

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
We’ll see.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Well your connections are fine.
It must be a mains leak.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.000
Well, your dog’s enjoying a swim anyway.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.400
We haven’t got a dog.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.000
Help!

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Help me!

25:35.600 --> 25:37.000
Help me!

25:45.200 --> 25:46.800
Are you all right?

25:52.400 --> 25:54.600
We haven’t clarified
the exact picture yet, but...

25:54.600 --> 25:57.000
it looks like a plumber was
attacked in some woman’s cellar.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.800
I’m not surprised, have you seen
how much these people charge?

26:00.200 --> 26:03.400
She claims that the damage was
done by some kind of large reptile.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.800
And I suppose you’re going to tell me...

26:04.800 --> 26:07.400
this town lies directly
on Cutter’s mythical fault line.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
I’m really beginning to dislike that man.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.200
All units, a second body
has been found in the basement.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.600
I repeat, a second body
has been found in the basement.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.400
Zero to team Bravo.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.600
Move into position and set up…

26:43.600 --> 26:44.800
Hold on.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.400
I want the press
kept as far away from this as possible.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.600
If we have to, we go
with an escaped crocodile story,

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
but apart from that, we deny everything.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.600
Sir.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.800
Claudia speaking.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.000
Right.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.600
Thank you. Bye-bye.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
They found a body in the basement.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.800
Special forces diver.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.400
Great.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.600
It’s our diver.
The man we lost in the reservoir.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.400
Looks like he died of shock.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
They found this tied around his wrist.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.000
We don’t know how the hell it got there.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.000
What kept you?

27:56.200 --> 27:57.600
What is it?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.600
Helen’s mad old aunt used
to give us those handkerchiefs.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.400
Same present every
single birthday and Christmas.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.800
And we used to make jokes about them.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.800
That’s a message.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.600
It means Helen’s waiting for me
on the other side of the anomaly.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.200
Just like she was in the Underground.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.600
Yeah.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.400
Why didn’t you tell me?

28:40.200 --> 28:43.000
You lied to me, to all of us.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.200
Try and see it from my perspective.
I had just found out...

28:47.400 --> 28:51.000
- ...that my dead wife was still alive.
- She might know things.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.200
Things that could help us.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.200
You have no right to decide what we
should know and when we should know it.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.800
She’s my wife.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.800
Maybe in your mind that gives you
some kind of special privilege.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.600
But this affects all of us.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.600
If you can’t see that,

29:11.200 --> 29:13.000
then you just can’t be here anymore.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.000
What?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.000
My memory’s back.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.000
Some of it anyhow. Enough
to know why you’re angry with me.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
Well, we’ve got a job to do Stephen.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.800
Can we at least talk about it?

29:39.600 --> 29:42.000
Look, I over-reacted.
I’ve already forgotten about it.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.000
I remember and you forget. Typical.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
Look,

29:46.600 --> 29:49.200
I thought that I was
never going to see you again...

29:49.200 --> 29:53.600
and I didn’t want to die without you
knowing that I liked you, you know.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.200
You should have been
thinking about your girlfriend.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
Yeah, well, the truth is, she and I,

29:59.800 --> 30:02.200
well, we don’t know
each other that well anymore.

30:02.200 --> 30:07.200
Well, now she’s back, you’ve got
a chance to get reacquainted.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.200
Abby, I’m sorry.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.000
Look,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.200
there’s no need
to make a big thing out of it.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.200
I fancied you for
a bit and now I don’t. That’s all.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
Area secured sir.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.000
The revelation that Helen Cutter’s
still alive changes everything.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.400
She’s still alive?

30:43.600 --> 30:46.200
- Um, how did I miss that?
- It's a long story.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.800
So, eight years,
she’s been living in the past.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.400
My God.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
How are we going to explain
Celebrity Love Island to her?

30:54.400 --> 30:56.200
Shut up Connor.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.600
She’s eight years ahead of us in terms
of understanding the anomalies.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.000
Her knowledge could be
priceless and we have to share it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.400
Which is fine if she
was here, but she isn’t.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
Which is why
we’re going to go and find her.

31:08.600 --> 31:13.400
We know she wants to make contact. She must
be brought back here, by force if necessary.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.000
This is my wife you’re talking about.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.200
Which is why I want you to go through
the anomaly and bring her back.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.800
You will of course
have a military escort.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.000
To do what?
Shoot her if she won’t come back?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.600
To protect you.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.400
Both of you.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.800
The alternative is you sever all ties with
the anomaly project with immediate effect.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.800
And we’ll go and find her ourselves.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.400
Okay.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.800
On one condition.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
I go on my own.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.600
There’s no question of force.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.600
I’ll do my best, but if she doesn’t
want to come back, then that’s it.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.800
How can we trust you?

31:55.400 --> 31:58.200
Oh, I’m sure Professor Cutter
won’t let us down again.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.600
You will try and remember
what side you’re on, won’t you?

32:10.800 --> 32:13.800
Okay, so you’ve got about
an hour of air, and a mile of rope.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.200
Take a compass reference
as soon as you get there,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.800
and just stay attached.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.000
After two hours, we’ll reel you back in.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.000
The water pressure in the
anomaly is going to be intense, okay?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.600
So the harder you swim,
the more air you’re going to use.

32:28.600 --> 32:33.200
Now this has an effective
range of about ten metres.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.600
If you have
to use it against a predator,

32:35.800 --> 32:38.000
wait until you
see the whites of its teeth.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.400
Helen!

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
Hello Nick!
I see you got my message.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.600
You’ve lost weight.
You haven’t been eating properly.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.400
You let me think you were dead.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.600
I am dead as the person you knew.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.800
My old life ended eight years ago.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.800
You can turn around.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.400
I’m decent.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.200
There’s no easy way to do this, is there?

35:28.400 --> 35:31.000
Well, maybe we should just skip the
small talk. Why didn’t you come back?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
What are you really upset about Nick?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.800
That I stayed away, or that
I didn’t tell you what I was doing?

35:37.800 --> 35:40.800
I’m not upset Helen. I just
don’t know who you are anymore.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.800
Do you want to know
why I didn’t come back?

35:47.600 --> 35:49.200
Because I knew...

35:49.600 --> 35:52.800
your conscience would make you
throw all this out there for everyone...

35:52.800 --> 35:55.600
to trample over and
I wasn’t ready to share it then.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.600
Hesperonis. Scary up close,
but cumbersome...

36:10.000 --> 36:11.800
and very stupid.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.400
What do you want Nick? An apology?

36:15.800 --> 36:18.600
- What’s the point?
- 8 years of my life back would be nice.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.600
Look, come on.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.400
People grieve and then they heal.
It happens all the time.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.800
Why should you be any different?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.600
Well, why come back at all then?

36:29.400 --> 36:31.200
Let me guess, you want something.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.800
Abby!

36:40.400 --> 36:43.800
- How long has he been?
- 91 minutes, 41 seconds.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.400
The drains. Stephen!

36:46.800 --> 36:50.000
In theory, a creature could make
its way along the sewage system...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.200
all the way to the river.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
And once it’s there,
it could go anywhere.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.000
And?

36:55.400 --> 36:58.000
Well, good news is the size of the
drains rules out anything bigger than...

36:58.000 --> 37:00.600
- ...a small mosasaur.
- Well, how small?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.400
Not small enough.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.800
What’s going on?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.600
You’ve come back before?

37:28.200 --> 37:29.800
Did you watch me grieve?

37:31.800 --> 37:33.800
Did you come to the funeral?

37:34.200 --> 37:35.800
No. Was it good?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.400
It was okay.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.000
I’ll answer all your questions, Nick.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.400
All you have to do is come with me.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.400
There are more anomalies
than you can possibly imagine.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.000
I know how to find them.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.600
I asked you a question.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.200
Why do you want me now?

37:59.600 --> 38:01.000
After so long?

38:02.400 --> 38:04.000
I’m human.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.800
I want company.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
I want to share this...

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
incredible gift.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.400
But only with you.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.200
Nick, I have seen such wonders.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.200
Things you wouldn’t believe.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.800
You’re asking me to abandon my life.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.600
Leave behind everything I know.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.600
People are dying back home, and you
want me to just run away with you?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.800
Animals die, Nick. Species die.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.800
You know I’m right.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.600
One day,

38:43.600 --> 38:46.200
humanity will disappear,
just like the dinosaurs.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.000
And nature doesn’t care,
something else will just take our place.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.800
Nick, just leave
all the other stuff behind.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.400
Come with me.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.400
I’ve got a job to do,
you could help me if you like.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.200
You’re rejecting me?

39:06.400 --> 39:08.400
I’m asking you to come back with me.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.800
I offer you the key to time.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.200
The key to time, Nick!

39:19.800 --> 39:21.600
And you turn your back on it?

39:23.600 --> 39:27.000
- You call yourself a scientist?
- I call myself a human being.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.800
His time's up.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.800
Stephen, that’s two hours.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.400
He’ll be running out of air.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.200
Come on, come on!

42:23.200 --> 42:25.400
- He’s lost his tank!
- Quick, get him out!

42:25.800 --> 42:27.000
Cutter!

42:27.200 --> 42:28.400
Get his head up.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.000
He’s not breathing!

42:33.600 --> 42:35.000
Medic!

42:35.400 --> 42:37.000
Get some air inside him.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.000
Bring him up.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.200
¡Wait! ¡Go, go, go!

42:53.800 --> 42:55.800
- Was Helen with you?
- Yes.

42:56.200 --> 42:57.600
So she was there.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.800
- You know what to do.
- Let’s go.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.200
- Who’s this?
- Sorry, it’s out of my hands.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.600
What?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.800
How long have I been out for?

43:36.400 --> 43:37.600
Not long.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.200
I have to talk to Claudia.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.800
There’s something you should know.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.400
- Stand still. Don’t move!
- What’s going on?

43:46.600 --> 43:51.400
Stay still!
