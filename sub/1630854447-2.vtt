00:21.242 --> 00:24.315
Aw. I'm never gonna get
over that <i>jachnoon.</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:27.421
I think you're
never gonna digest that <i>jachnoon.</i>

00:27.421 --> 00:28.591
Oh, I'll digest it.

00:28.591 --> 00:30.160
Really?
I'll digest it all day long.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.631
<i>Jachnoon</i> is primarily bread.
No, it-- It--

00:31.631 --> 00:33.200
It-- It took me
to this m-moment...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.570
<i>The cursing started like this.</i>

00:34.570 --> 00:38.544
You can't even
digest bread.

00:38.544 --> 00:40.447
Huh? Well, yeah, sure.

00:40.447 --> 00:42.819
I gotcha.

00:42.819 --> 00:44.857
<i>B'hatzlacha rabah.</i>

00:44.857 --> 00:46.326
Huh?

00:46.326 --> 00:47.529
<i>B'hatzlacha rabah.</i>

00:55.210 --> 00:56.446
What did she say
to you?

00:58.551 --> 01:01.289
Oh, shit.
What'd she say?

01:01.289 --> 01:04.596
She just-- She just cursed
my unborn daughter.

01:07.869 --> 01:09.873
That's fine. You know,
I-I don't have any more cash.

01:09.873 --> 01:11.309
If-- I don't know
if you guys have any.

01:11.309 --> 01:13.113
Just-- Just to make it stop.
Really?

01:13.113 --> 01:15.451
Just to make it stop.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.288
Okay, okay.
Okay, I have, like, some.

01:17.288 --> 01:18.891
I have a few.
I have a few things.

01:18.891 --> 01:21.864
Hey. Sorry about him.
Sorry, here, we have--

01:21.864 --> 01:23.233
Yeah, get it in there.

01:23.233 --> 01:24.836
Thank you. Sorry.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.786
That doesn't sound--
That's not a...

01:32.786 --> 01:33.921
No.
...Like, a blessing.

01:33.921 --> 01:35.692
It's not a good one.

01:35.692 --> 01:37.863
Oh.

01:37.863 --> 01:39.633
Okay. Okay.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.169
Did she say "gonorrhea"?
Yeah.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.371
Did you say "gonorrhea"?

01:42.371 --> 01:44.208
Listen, let's go.
I-I-I'm scared of her.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.512
You shouldn't say that
to people.

01:45.512 --> 01:47.148
That's...
You can leave.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.450
I know, but I'm part of the
group, so if the group is...

01:48.450 --> 01:49.653
Just do it then,
and let's go.
Yeah, sorry.

01:49.653 --> 01:50.722
Can we please go?

01:50.722 --> 01:51.791
Yeah.
Here you go. Hi.

01:51.791 --> 01:52.893
I'm sorry about that.

01:52.893 --> 01:54.797
Is that...?

01:54.797 --> 01:57.435
Beggar woman: Oh. Oh.

02:07.856 --> 02:11.296
<i>She told him that he would
heal the world with his kindness,</i>

02:11.296 --> 02:13.835
<i>that he was destined
for a righteous path,</i>

02:13.835 --> 02:15.572
<i>that his future was assured,</i>

02:15.572 --> 02:19.278
<i>that nothing bad
would happen to him.</i>

02:24.455 --> 02:26.961
Can you--
Of course I can hear you.

02:26.961 --> 02:28.564
You're yelling.

02:28.564 --> 02:30.300
Yes.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.304
Uh-- No.

02:32.304 --> 02:34.308
No, Hannah, Mona cannot
take you to the Hamptons.

02:34.308 --> 02:36.446
She's supposed to be on
vacation in the first place.

02:36.446 --> 02:38.985
Can you please-- Can you
please just give her back her
phone?

02:38.985 --> 02:40.287
Yeah, so I can talk to her.

02:40.287 --> 02:41.991
That's right.
I am so sorry, Mona.

02:41.991 --> 02:43.661
No, this is so nice of you. Yeah.

02:43.661 --> 02:46.332
I know, but your son doesn't
arrive until tonight, right?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.869
Yeah, I so appreciate this.
Really. I know.

02:47.869 --> 02:49.973
Uh-- You're a real life
- saver. Okay.

02:49.973 --> 02:54.616
<i>Monday had come, and still,
there was nothing from Rachel.</i>

02:54.616 --> 02:56.754
<i>I know that you think
my job is a hobby,</i>

02:56.754 --> 02:58.156
<i>but I have real obligations,</i>

02:58.156 --> 02:59.993
<i>and the kids were expecting
to go to the Hamptons with you,</i>

02:59.993 --> 03:01.730
<i>and this was Mona's
one week off.</i>

03:05.304 --> 03:07.007
<i>This was not the life
that the beggar woman</i>

03:07.007 --> 03:08.075
<i>had promised him.</i>

03:08.075 --> 03:10.715
So, we need to redo the
sonogram on Mrs. Shalmoni.

03:10.715 --> 03:11.951
Uh, what is the most common

03:11.951 --> 03:13.487
liver condition
associated with Crohn's?

03:13.487 --> 03:14.890
Dr. Bartuck
would like to see you

03:14.890 --> 03:17.260
when you have a chance.
Yes, sure, sure.

03:22.004 --> 03:23.941
Ah, Dr. Fleishman.
Dr. Bartuck.

03:23.941 --> 03:25.879
Uh, Ida said
you wanted a word.

03:25.879 --> 03:28.584
Have a seat.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.688
So...
Yes.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.026
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

03:33.026 --> 03:34.696
I'm taking over.

03:34.696 --> 03:35.899
Chief of Medicine.

03:35.899 --> 03:37.903
Wow.
Congratulations.

03:37.903 --> 03:39.506
That's--
That's just great.

03:39.506 --> 03:42.344
Now, Janice is taking over
the division,

03:42.344 --> 03:44.783
which means she needs to
replace herself for the subdivision,

03:44.783 --> 03:47.688
and I'd like it
to go to you.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.732
Well, I-I don't know
what to say.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.302
Um, thank you.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.738
Well, you're good
with patients.

03:55.738 --> 03:57.576
You're precise.
You care.

03:57.576 --> 04:00.582
Now, it's not a lock.
Janice has her own process,

04:00.582 --> 04:01.984
but you're the favorite.

04:01.984 --> 04:03.721
It's yours to lose.

04:06.727 --> 04:08.831
<i>A promotion.</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:11.436
<i>See that, Rachel?</i>

04:11.436 --> 04:13.306
<i>Toby thought back to
when he was a fellow</i>

04:13.306 --> 04:15.578
<i>and when Bartuck was
an actual practicing doctor,</i>

04:15.578 --> 04:18.083
<i>before he began his dubious
ascent to fundraiser.</i>

04:18.083 --> 04:20.087
And she-- Wait, wait, wait.

04:20.087 --> 04:21.690
W-What did she say?

04:21.690 --> 04:24.095
"My father is sick
with a lot of things."

04:24.095 --> 04:25.497
That's right, right.

04:25.497 --> 04:26.834
"My father is sick
with a lot of things,

04:26.834 --> 04:28.069
Dr. Bartuck,

04:28.069 --> 04:29.706
but uterine cancer
isn't one of them!"

04:30.808 --> 04:32.411
<i>That year, Dr. Loo,</i>

04:32.411 --> 04:34.415
<i>the head of
the gastroenterology division,</i>

04:34.415 --> 04:36.754
<i>found himself in the hospital
as a patient</i>

04:36.754 --> 04:41.564
<i>with an aggressive, relentless
case of pancreatic cancer.</i>

04:41.564 --> 04:42.699
Oh.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.105
<i>Then, finally, just a month
later, it was time.</i>

04:48.043 --> 04:50.515
Okay, uh, we'll go.

04:50.515 --> 04:52.986
No, stay.

04:52.986 --> 04:55.992
You were as big a part
of his life as I was.

05:03.975 --> 05:07.114
That's so sad.
I know.

05:07.114 --> 05:09.753
What I keep thinking about
is just, like,

05:09.753 --> 05:12.759
the privilege
of having known him, you know?

05:12.759 --> 05:16.834
I mean, to know them,
and to be a part of it.

05:16.834 --> 05:18.638
Like, to be there, you know?

05:18.638 --> 05:21.042
It's pretty amazing you were
in the room, though.

05:21.042 --> 05:22.746
I mean, that... Yeah.

05:22.746 --> 05:24.482
...that means you're in, Toby.

05:26.019 --> 05:27.488
Is that what they say
in the mailroom

05:27.488 --> 05:30.929
when you get to watch
a senior agent die?

05:30.929 --> 05:32.031
Not, that's not what I mean.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.166
No, I know what you mean.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.969
I don't think you know
what I mean.

05:38.711 --> 05:42.518
I mean that I think doing this
is its own reward.

05:44.188 --> 05:45.525
Are you getting into bed?

05:45.525 --> 05:49.165
I gotta return
a thousand e-mails.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.001
Okay.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.720
<i>Then, two years ago,
the Fleishmans were invited</i>

05:59.720 --> 06:01.456
<i>for New Year's
to the second home</i>

06:01.456 --> 06:03.761
<i>of Miriam
and Sam Rothberg in Saratoga.</i>

06:06.634 --> 06:08.403
If you have four houses,
how do you decide

06:08.403 --> 06:09.706
which to call your second?

06:09.706 --> 06:11.810
Oh, it's the one
you bought second.

06:11.810 --> 06:14.650
Hmm.
That makes sense.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.486
Welcome, Fleishmans!

06:16.486 --> 06:18.591
Look at this place.
It's amazing.

06:18.591 --> 06:21.062
Welcome to Paniquil.

06:21.062 --> 06:22.431
Oh, Paniquil.

06:22.431 --> 06:23.734
So, you named this after
an antidepressant

06:23.734 --> 06:25.538
that doesn't interfere
with sexual arousal?

06:25.538 --> 06:26.372
No, no, no.

06:26.372 --> 06:27.876
I named it after
an antidepressant

06:27.876 --> 06:29.211
that doesn't interfere
with sexual arousal

06:29.211 --> 06:30.548
that made me rich.

06:30.548 --> 06:32.585
Oh. Well...
Let me show you around.

06:32.585 --> 06:33.988
Oh.

06:48.851 --> 06:50.187
Taste that?
Yeah, I taste it.

06:50.187 --> 06:52.157
It's, you know--
it's very-- I taste it.

06:54.796 --> 06:57.167
You still at the hospital?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.038
Well, you know, people
are still getting sick, so.

07:00.675 --> 07:02.044
You know, we're looking
for someone to head up

07:02.044 --> 07:06.520
a new division
around marijuana.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.189
Sorry, Fendant is getting
into marijuana?

07:08.189 --> 07:09.760
Oh, Lord, no, no.
We're looking for somebody

07:09.760 --> 07:12.932
to help lead a new division
dedicated to debunking myths

07:12.932 --> 07:14.803
about alternative therapies.

07:14.803 --> 07:16.172
Oh. Oh, I see.

07:16.172 --> 07:19.145
A lot of misinformation out
there, as I'm sure you know.

07:19.145 --> 07:20.748
Oh, no.
I-- I don't know.

07:20.748 --> 07:22.619
I mean, I've seen a lot of
cancer patients benefit from

07:22.619 --> 07:23.921
alternative...
Don't-- Don't--
Don't-- Don't--

07:23.921 --> 07:26.527
Don't tell me
you're an acupuncture guy.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.664
No, no.
Well, I mean, it's not a cure,

07:28.664 --> 07:30.200
but it actually
does provide pain relief.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.804
Absolutely. Yeah.

07:31.804 --> 07:35.177
Well, uh, you know, you'd be
heading up a big division,

07:35.177 --> 07:37.949
bringing in a mil
before bonuses.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.953
You'd be managing
your own team.

07:39.953 --> 07:41.690
Great hours.
The works.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.861
I don't know. I think I do my
best with a patient interface,

07:43.861 --> 07:45.832
I think. Yeah.
Thank you.

07:45.832 --> 07:50.073
Yeah, Rachel--
Rachel said you'd resist.

07:50.073 --> 07:51.242
Yeah?
Mm.

07:51.242 --> 07:54.081
Did I mention the house
in Vail?

07:54.081 --> 07:56.553
Director-level gets a key.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.697
"What's wrong?"
Why don't you ask Sam,

08:01.697 --> 08:02.932
with whom you colluded
and orchestrated.

08:02.932 --> 08:04.235
"Colluded?"

08:04.235 --> 08:07.241
It's a job officer, Toby.
It's an opportunity.

08:07.241 --> 08:08.878
At the very least,
always take the meeting, right?

08:08.878 --> 08:10.882
It's-- It's the opposite
of an opportunity, okay?

08:10.882 --> 08:12.585
It is the antithesis
of what I do.

08:12.585 --> 08:14.121
He wants me to head up
a division that encourages

08:14.121 --> 08:15.992
the-- the deprivation
of legitimate avenues

08:15.992 --> 08:17.261
of pain relief
for sick patients.

08:17.261 --> 08:19.031
I want you
to feel rewarded.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.135
You should get a break
from the grind.

08:21.135 --> 08:22.271
But it is not a grind, okay?

08:22.271 --> 08:23.974
Do you understand
how hurtful it is

08:23.974 --> 08:25.243
that this is
what's important to you?

08:25.243 --> 08:26.713
You're screaming.

08:26.713 --> 08:28.016
I did not become a doctor
to get rich, okay?

08:28.016 --> 08:29.719
I did it to live
a meaningful life.

08:29.719 --> 08:31.824
Yeah, well, I would like to
own an apartment someday.

08:31.824 --> 08:34.128
Excuse me, I make
almost $300,000 a year.

08:34.128 --> 08:36.099
I am a rich man
in every single culture

08:36.099 --> 08:37.735
except the 40 stupid
square blocks

08:37.735 --> 08:39.038
that you insist
we live within.

08:39.038 --> 08:40.140
You act like you need
to work all the time

08:40.140 --> 08:41.710
because I'm some bum
on the couch.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.279
If you had a job where people
counted on you

08:43.279 --> 08:45.885
for their livelihood,
maybe you would get it.

08:45.885 --> 08:48.256
Oh.

08:48.256 --> 08:49.926
Are you serious?

08:49.926 --> 08:53.901
Dad? Dad?

08:55.705 --> 08:57.141
I don't know why we still have
these conversations.

08:57.141 --> 08:59.044
I-I never
misrepresented myself.

08:59.044 --> 09:01.015
Well, neither did I.

09:01.015 --> 09:02.585
Okay.

09:04.756 --> 09:06.593
<i>Immediately following
that weekend,</i>

09:06.593 --> 09:09.031
<i>Rachel began to look
at nicer apartments</i>

09:09.031 --> 09:11.670
<i>without even talking to him.</i>

09:11.670 --> 09:13.774
Sam knows the builder. Mm.

09:13.774 --> 09:15.343
They don't have their
certificate of occupancy,

09:15.343 --> 09:17.014
so they can't really
show it yet,

09:17.014 --> 09:19.218
so early access. Wow.

09:19.218 --> 09:21.322
I guess it's really
who you know, huh?

09:21.322 --> 09:23.226
Exactly.
Yeah.

09:23.226 --> 09:25.063
They're calling it
The Golden.

09:25.063 --> 09:26.700
Wow. The Golden.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.606
Just in-- Just in case you
missed any of the subtext.

09:29.606 --> 09:31.175
It's the original moulding.

09:31.175 --> 09:32.612
Yeah, it's new construction.

09:32.612 --> 09:34.148
The whole thing's original.

09:37.187 --> 09:38.657
Well, I like it.

09:38.657 --> 09:39.926
Oh, really?
Come on.

09:39.926 --> 09:41.697
Its like everything I hate
about New York City,

09:41.697 --> 09:43.901
like new money
imitating old money.

09:43.901 --> 09:45.972
Come on.
"The Golden".

09:45.972 --> 09:47.207
Yeah, you said that.

09:47.207 --> 09:50.781
Well, yeah.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.084
Sam says we can make
an offer now

09:52.084 --> 09:53.920
before they put it
on the market.

09:56.993 --> 09:59.666
We'll finally have a place.
Mm-hmm.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.637
We'll live here forever,
and our children

10:01.637 --> 10:05.076
will visit us when they're
married and have children.

10:05.076 --> 10:06.980
You act like you need me
to say yes,

10:06.980 --> 10:08.950
but you already made
a decision.

10:14.127 --> 10:18.704
<i>And that was that.</i>

10:31.730 --> 10:34.268
<i>And now look at him--
a promotion--</i>

10:34.268 --> 10:36.272
<i>not for leveraging
or subverting,</i>

10:36.272 --> 10:38.109
<i>not for disrupting,</i>

10:38.109 --> 10:40.982
<i>just for being devoted to what
he did and being good at it.</i>

10:40.982 --> 10:43.219
<i>"See, Rachel?"
He wanted to tell her.</i>

10:43.219 --> 10:45.023
<i>"Success can build.</i>

10:45.023 --> 10:50.133
<i>You don't have to lunge
for it like an animal."</i>

10:50.133 --> 10:52.004
Mona, hi.
I am so sorry.

10:52.004 --> 10:53.741
I really thought she would
be back by now.

10:53.741 --> 10:55.410
Hey, you didn't happen
to make dinner, did you?

10:55.410 --> 10:56.980
I'm gonna go be with my son.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.149
Okay.
Thanks for everything.

10:58.149 --> 11:00.020
I really--
I do appreciate it.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.790
Okay.
Hey, kids. I'm back.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.159
I'm gonna make some dinner, okay?

11:03.159 --> 11:04.763
<i>He was annoyed.</i>

11:04.763 --> 11:06.032
<i>Lord knows Rachel came home
late all the time</i>

11:06.032 --> 11:07.334
<i>and didn't get attitude
from Mona.</i>

11:07.334 --> 11:09.271
Is Mom here?
Hey.

11:09.271 --> 11:10.407
We're supposed to be there
by dinner.

11:10.407 --> 11:11.843
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Lexi.

11:11.843 --> 11:13.413
Yeah, sorry, honey.
Mom's delayed.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.718
She would be back by tonight,
tomorrow at the latest.

11:15.718 --> 11:16.920
God, why is it
so hot in here?

11:16.920 --> 11:19.258
No, she promised me dinner
in the Hamptons.

11:19.258 --> 11:21.028
Yeah, well,
Mom's delayed, okay?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.297
She's always delayed.

11:22.297 --> 11:23.867
Oof. God,
is the air conditioning on?

11:23.867 --> 11:26.305
Did it break or something?
I'm gonna make--

11:26.305 --> 11:27.875
I'm gonna find a recipe.
You don't worry.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.311
Last year, she had
to go to Italy

11:29.311 --> 11:31.315
'cause she was on tour
with Alejandra, and this year,

11:31.315 --> 11:33.921
she promised we'd have
a whole week together.

11:33.921 --> 11:36.192
You know what?
You're not wrong.

11:36.192 --> 11:37.494
You deserve a summer.

11:37.494 --> 11:39.331
Everybody is getting together
without me!

11:39.331 --> 11:42.036
Don't you understand that?

11:45.645 --> 11:47.749
You know, guys, I had
some great news today.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.929
<i>My tits really wanna be
squeezed more.</i>
Oh, sweet Jesus.

11:54.929 --> 11:56.933
<i>Oh, harder.</i>
Woman #2: <i>It's so hot.</i>

11:56.933 --> 11:58.937
<i>My pussy's so wet.</i>
No. No. No.

11:58.937 --> 12:00.473
<i>Come on, are you
hard yet?</i>
Stop.

12:03.781 --> 12:05.116
Okay.

12:09.959 --> 12:12.097
Oh, my God.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.803
<i>Toby briefly entertained
the idea that it was Mona--</i>

12:14.803 --> 12:16.506
<i>that, in her anger,
she sat down</i>

12:16.506 --> 12:18.944
<i>and treated herself
to a big old afternoon</i>

12:18.944 --> 12:19.979
<i>of Internet porn.</i>

12:19.979 --> 12:22.084
<i>But the theory fell apart
when he realized</i>

12:22.084 --> 12:25.022
<i>that Mona probably knew
how to spell "vagina."</i>

12:30.233 --> 12:33.006
Ooh.

12:33.006 --> 12:35.377
Kids?

12:35.377 --> 12:36.946
Is Mom here?

12:42.157 --> 12:43.393
Let me have a word with Solly.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.837
I didn't do it.

12:48.837 --> 12:50.975
Solly.

12:50.975 --> 12:52.477
I-I don't know why
those things came up.

12:52.477 --> 12:54.381
They just came up.

12:54.381 --> 12:56.385
Alright. Here.

12:56.385 --> 13:00.260
It's okay.
Come sit down for a minute.

13:00.260 --> 13:05.136
Listen, there is nothing to be
ashamed of or-- or afraid of.

13:05.136 --> 13:07.441
Are you curious about girls?

13:07.441 --> 13:09.846
I just wanted to know
what it looked like underneath.

13:09.846 --> 13:11.983
Yeah, no, I understand.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.923
Should I maybe get--
get you a book for kids?

13:14.923 --> 13:17.260
Like, maybe with pictures?
No.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.597
I don't want to see it
ever again.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.300
Yeah, no,
that makes perfect sense.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.437
Of course not.
Of course not.

13:22.437 --> 13:24.141
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
It's not okay.

13:24.141 --> 13:26.112
I hate it.

13:26.112 --> 13:27.314
I know. I know.

13:27.314 --> 13:30.554
Listen, um,
I-I just want you to know

13:30.554 --> 13:33.994
that that's not really
what it's like, okay?

13:33.994 --> 13:37.434
That's like someone's fantasy
of what people might want.

13:37.434 --> 13:38.904
That's not what
it's really like

13:38.904 --> 13:40.306
for two people
to have sex, okay?

13:40.306 --> 13:41.475
Don't say that word!
Yeah.

13:41.475 --> 13:43.079
Okay. I won't say it.
Yeah. I won't.

13:44.348 --> 13:46.185
Is that Mom?
Um...

13:46.185 --> 13:47.187
Don't tell her.

13:47.187 --> 13:48.924
No, no, I won't.
I won't.

13:50.928 --> 13:52.932
<i>It was Rachel.
He was sure of it.</i>

13:52.932 --> 13:55.170
<i>Some beam of nuclear energy
had reached her</i>

13:55.170 --> 13:58.443
<i>and activated her remaining
shreds of maternal instinct.</i>

13:58.443 --> 14:00.046
<i>Just thinking about you, stud.</i>

14:00.046 --> 14:03.086
<i>Poison emoji. Finger gun
emoji. Hang ten emoji.</i>

14:03.086 --> 14:05.591
It's the hospital.

14:05.591 --> 14:08.964
<i>Growing up
was disgusting. Literally.</i>

14:08.964 --> 14:12.170
<i>It was filled with all these
horrible moments of revulsion.</i>

14:12.170 --> 14:13.372
You okay, buddy?

14:13.372 --> 14:15.511
I'm gonna go watch
"Karate Kid".

14:15.511 --> 14:17.447
Can I go?
Of course.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.184
Yeah, of course.

14:33.145 --> 14:36.185
<i>My 9-year-old watched
porn on the computer</i>

14:36.185 --> 14:39.224
<i>for hours
in front of you today.</i>

14:39.224 --> 14:43.065
<i>We will no longer
be requiring your services.</i>

14:43.065 --> 14:45.403
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

14:47.274 --> 14:50.146
<i>Holy shit.</i>

14:50.146 --> 14:52.350
<i>What had he done?</i>

14:52.350 --> 14:54.656
<i>Toby spent all night in vain
trying to figure out</i>

14:54.656 --> 14:56.993
<i>how to take back
his text to Mona.</i>

14:56.993 --> 15:00.033
<i>Holy shit. He'd fired
the most stable presence</i>

15:00.033 --> 15:01.970
<i>his children
had in their lives.</i>

15:01.970 --> 15:03.272
No, I know, Simone.
Can you--

15:03.272 --> 15:06.513
Can you please just tell me
when she's getting back?

15:06.513 --> 15:08.650
Okay. Well, she went
to Everglade, right?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.521
Yeah, well, can you tell me
how long it goes?

15:10.521 --> 15:11.523
Can you tell me that?
Can you-- No.

15:11.523 --> 15:12.959
Stop that.
Stop that.

15:12.959 --> 15:14.127
No, not you. Sorry.
I'm hungry.

15:14.127 --> 15:15.998
Yeah, I know.
No, can you tell me, uh,

15:15.998 --> 15:19.004
if she's still there?
Can-- Can you tell me
anything?

15:19.004 --> 15:21.710
No? Okay. Great.
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:21.710 --> 15:24.147
Can we just wait at home for
Mom to take us to the
Hamptons?

15:24.147 --> 15:26.118
I wish. I just don't know when
she's getting back yet.

15:26.118 --> 15:27.555
But, look, w-w-why would you
just want to leave here?

15:27.555 --> 15:29.258
You know, it's weird.
Everybody wants to leave

15:29.258 --> 15:30.728
the city when it gets hot,
but that's actually a mistake.

15:30.728 --> 15:33.032
Nothing beats summer
in the city.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.238
You know, everything gets
so green, everyone gathers.

15:36.238 --> 15:37.575
It smells like garbage.

15:37.575 --> 15:40.581
Yeah. Yeah.

15:40.581 --> 15:42.685
You used to love
coming in with me.

15:42.685 --> 15:44.689
Yeah, when I was a baby.
I know.

15:44.689 --> 15:46.392
I'll make it up to you, okay?

15:46.392 --> 15:49.431
Can we go to the park?
We can find the churros guys.

15:49.431 --> 15:50.601
You know what?
That sounds like fun,

15:50.601 --> 15:52.204
and I'm sure
Mom will be back by tonight.

15:52.204 --> 15:53.272
You said that last night.

15:53.272 --> 15:54.441
Mm, I know.
Be good.

15:54.441 --> 15:56.144
The time will go by
fast, okay?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.055
<i>But it didn't.</i>

16:01.055 --> 16:03.594
<i>How it broke his heart.</i>

16:03.594 --> 16:05.764
<i>How Toby had always
loved summer.</i>

16:25.203 --> 16:27.040
<i>Hello, it is
a beautiful day</i>

16:27.040 --> 16:29.111
<i>here at Everglade,
an exclusive wellness retreat</i>

16:29.111 --> 16:31.248
<i>located in the splendor
of the Catskill Mountains.</i>

16:31.248 --> 16:33.252
<i>This is Sage.
How can I help facilitate y--</i>

16:33.252 --> 16:35.490
Yeah, sorry, hi.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

16:35.490 --> 16:37.060
but I'm just--
uh, I'm at my job.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.496
Um, can you please tell me
if Rachel Fleishman

16:38.496 --> 16:39.532
is still checked in?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.101
<i>I'm so sorry.</i> Yeah.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.505
<i>I can't talk about
a guest's status.</i>

16:42.505 --> 16:45.043
No, I just need to know
if she's-- if she's there.

16:45.043 --> 16:46.312
Sorry, I'm her husband.

16:46.312 --> 16:47.648
Um, I just have a message
to get to her.

16:47.648 --> 16:49.519
Can you pass on a message
for her?

16:49.519 --> 16:51.088
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

16:51.088 --> 16:52.525
<i>I can't reveal the status
of our guests.</i>

16:52.525 --> 16:54.194
I don't need to know
her status,

16:54.194 --> 16:54.996
just if she's there.

16:54.996 --> 16:56.666
I-I'm sorry-- Yeah.
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

16:56.666 --> 16:58.637
<i>I can't reveal the status
of our guests.</i>

16:58.637 --> 17:00.273
Okay.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

17:00.273 --> 17:02.076
Okay.

17:07.655 --> 17:11.395
<i>Hey. Just... please.
I'm not mad.</i>

17:11.395 --> 17:13.132
<i>I'm a real person.</i>

17:13.132 --> 17:15.504
<i>I exist even when
you can't see me.</i>

17:15.504 --> 17:17.508
<i>Can I get an ETA, Rachel?</i>

17:22.384 --> 17:25.658
Wow. A division head.
You must so proud, Janice.

17:25.658 --> 17:27.160
It'll be a challenge,
I know.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.496
I think of all the things
I'll have to do now

17:28.496 --> 17:29.532
that I'm not
seeing patients.

17:29.532 --> 17:31.268
Ugh.
Ugh. Like fundraising.

17:31.268 --> 17:32.103
Don't knock fundraising.

17:32.103 --> 17:34.141
You and I don't have jobs
without it.

17:34.141 --> 17:35.511
I don't know. I think I would
just miss my patients.

17:35.511 --> 17:38.717
Advancing sometimes means
missing a thing you loved.

17:38.717 --> 17:41.255
I think I'm gonna love this,
too, though.

17:41.255 --> 17:43.426
Shit.
Hey, aren't those your kids?

17:43.426 --> 17:45.564
Um...
Woman over intercom:

17:45.564 --> 17:47.167
<i>Paging Dr. Wong.</i>

17:47.167 --> 17:50.406
Oh.
I have an endoscopy.

17:53.814 --> 17:58.155
<i>His kids deserved
a better summer than this.</i>

17:58.155 --> 18:00.293
They all deserved
better than this.

18:02.698 --> 18:04.201
Hey, do you have a second?

18:04.201 --> 18:07.273
Um, I need a personal day
or two.

18:07.273 --> 18:08.744
Well, two. Two.

18:08.744 --> 18:11.315
Is everything alright?
Yeah, my-- um, well,

18:11.315 --> 18:13.820
Rachel, uh, she's on an
extended trip. It couldn't be avoided.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.323
And my-- my babysitter's
on vacation.

18:15.323 --> 18:16.860
<i>Holy shit.
He'd fired Mona.</i>

18:16.860 --> 18:18.462
Well, it's not ideal.

18:18.462 --> 18:20.166
I told David Cooper
he was getting the best.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.736
Yes, and I will be right in
if I'm needed.

18:21.736 --> 18:22.705
I will check in on the hour.

18:22.705 --> 18:23.840
I gave Mr. Cooper my cell.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.577
The fellows know
he's a priority.

18:28.717 --> 18:30.821
Alright, two days.
But you'll check in.

18:30.821 --> 18:33.325
Okay.
Thank you.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.739
Anyone here want to go
to the Hamptons?

18:39.739 --> 18:42.143
Yes! Yes!

18:47.955 --> 18:50.259
Does Mom even know
you have her car?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.330
Yeah, I said,
are you ready?

18:52.330 --> 18:53.533
Come on.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.302
Alright.

19:04.655 --> 19:06.826
Are you gonna get
your own car?

19:06.826 --> 19:08.964
Hmm?
Can--
Can you even afford one?

19:08.964 --> 19:10.834
What-- Yes.
Yes, I can afford a car.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.470
You do understand
I'm a doctor and not, like--

19:12.470 --> 19:13.840
not, like, a homeless person, right?

19:13.840 --> 19:14.976
Dad.
What?

19:14.976 --> 19:19.652
You can't say
"homeless person."

19:30.874 --> 19:32.745
Hey, Dad?
Mm-hmm?

19:32.745 --> 19:34.816
What's the block universe?

19:34.816 --> 19:37.655
Oh.
Um, it's a-- it's a theory.

19:37.655 --> 19:40.994
It's this idea that, like,
all of life is happening

19:40.994 --> 19:42.731
at the same time.

19:49.277 --> 19:52.818
Like, all points of existence are,

19:52.818 --> 19:54.655
I don't know,
occurring simultaneously.

19:54.655 --> 19:58.897
Just try to breathe through
it, okay? Oh, love, I'm sorry.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.401
Is he gonna throw up?
Gross.

20:02.772 --> 20:05.511
So, it means that, like--

20:05.511 --> 20:09.251
like, your past
and present and future...

20:09.251 --> 20:11.689
♪ ...Washed the spider out ♪

20:11.689 --> 20:13.894
...are all happening,

20:13.894 --> 20:15.898
like, all at once.

20:15.898 --> 20:21.709
♪ Round and round,
round and round ♪

20:21.709 --> 20:26.018
♪ The wheels on the bus
go round and round ♪

20:26.018 --> 20:28.990
I spy with my little eye,
something that's blue.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.461
It's a big part
of my life.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.606
You want me to sit here
with my hands in my lap

20:36.606 --> 20:41.783
to do some public display of
not working for your satisfaction.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.789
Look, if I got this done,
I could finally relax.

20:44.789 --> 20:47.795
It's not your schedule--
Oh, suddenly it's my schedule

20:47.795 --> 20:49.665
that's the problem?
Okay.

20:52.003 --> 20:54.842
A-At once?

20:54.842 --> 20:56.378
That's so busy.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.817
Mm-hmm.
I mean, you don't have to worry

20:58.817 --> 21:01.589
about you right now, though.

21:01.589 --> 21:03.793
What if I'm sitting on myself
from the last time we were
here?

21:03.793 --> 21:06.699
Yeah, you know, it's just--
it's just a theory, okay?

21:08.302 --> 21:10.674
<i>It was best not to think
about the block universe.</i>

21:10.674 --> 21:12.545
<i>Toby didn't want to think
about any theory of life</i>

21:12.545 --> 21:13.947
<i>in which the thing
you were dealing with</i>

21:13.947 --> 21:15.984
<i>was an absolute reality.</i>

21:21.361 --> 21:23.365
<i>He couldn't bear the scope
of regret</i>

21:23.365 --> 21:25.571
<i>and missed chances
and alternate choices.</i>

21:25.571 --> 21:28.042
<i>He didn't want to think
about possibility anymore.</i>

21:28.042 --> 21:29.946
<i>Possibility was a trap.</i>

21:35.456 --> 21:38.863
Hey, does anybody
want to get some food?

21:38.863 --> 21:41.803
<i>You know what else is a trap?</i>

21:41.803 --> 21:44.575
<i>The Hamptons.</i>

21:44.575 --> 21:46.078
You know, kids, it's--
it's nice

21:46.078 --> 21:47.748
that you have a house
in the Hamptons, okay?

21:47.748 --> 21:49.552
It actually is really nice
that you can get used to this.

21:49.552 --> 21:51.789
But it's also-- it's also
important to think

21:51.789 --> 21:53.125
about economy disparity.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.729
It's important that privileged
kids like you,

21:54.729 --> 21:56.733
like, think a little bit
about that, you know?

21:56.733 --> 21:58.035
I mean, look at these houses.

21:58.035 --> 21:59.839
I mean, you think inside
these houses are people

21:59.839 --> 22:01.576
that have been rewarded
for their great acts

22:01.576 --> 22:03.112
of kindness
and good works?

22:03.112 --> 22:05.817
No. Unh-uh. No. No,
inside these houses are pirates.

22:05.817 --> 22:06.819
Pirates?
Yeah.

22:06.819 --> 22:08.489
I mean, a kind of pirate.
A kind of pirate.

22:08.489 --> 22:10.159
The kind of pirate
that takes and takes

22:10.159 --> 22:11.562
even though he has enough,
you know?

22:11.562 --> 22:12.898
Listen, you guys
are gonna grow up

22:12.898 --> 22:14.568
and do great things
in your life,

22:14.568 --> 22:15.871
but you have to understand,
there's such a thing as--

22:15.871 --> 22:17.373
as enough.

22:17.373 --> 22:18.777
Okay.

22:18.777 --> 22:20.547
Whatever, Dad.

22:32.470 --> 22:34.073
Okay.

22:38.583 --> 22:41.956
Look at that sunset.
It's so pretty, isn't it?

22:41.956 --> 22:43.192
You know, but you have
to remember,

22:43.192 --> 22:44.528
sunsets are also problematic,
you know,

22:44.528 --> 22:45.964
because they're only
for the wealthy.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.635
In cities, there are tall
buildings so you can't see it.

22:47.635 --> 22:49.404
You know, you got to come
to a place like this

22:49.404 --> 22:50.574
just to catch a glimpse of
what would be one of the true,

22:50.574 --> 22:52.945
free pleasures in life,
you know?

22:52.945 --> 22:55.584
Okay. Great.
Can I just have the keys?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.386
Yeah.

23:07.206 --> 23:08.643
<i>He hated this place.</i>

23:08.643 --> 23:10.179
I get the big room!
No, you don't.

23:10.179 --> 23:11.181
You had it last time.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.785
I want it!
It's my turn.

23:12.785 --> 23:14.822
No, it's not.

23:14.822 --> 23:16.559
<i>Absolutely hated it.</i>

23:22.236 --> 23:25.109
<i>Hated its beautiful views,</i>

23:25.109 --> 23:27.681
<i>hated waking up
to the salt air...</i>

23:31.656 --> 23:35.964
<i>...hated the bed that cradled
him like it was his mother.</i>

23:35.964 --> 23:39.839
<i>Something, something,
economic disparity,</i>

23:39.839 --> 23:42.043
<i>something, something,
wealth distribution.</i>

23:47.588 --> 23:48.723
Night, Sol.

23:48.723 --> 23:50.827
Night, Dad.

23:52.196 --> 23:55.871
<i>But however much he didn't
like the house when it was his,</i>

23:55.871 --> 24:01.181
<i>boy, did he extra not like it
now that it wasn't.</i>

24:19.518 --> 24:21.923
<i>He was last there in winter.</i>

24:21.923 --> 24:24.929
<i>They'd come out for the
Leffers' anniversary party.</i>

24:24.929 --> 24:27.568
<i>He'd been asking for a divorce
for months by then,</i>

24:27.568 --> 24:32.110
<i>and each time he brought it
up, she'd get crazy.</i>

24:32.110 --> 24:34.882
<i>But it was quiet there, the
way it never was in the summer,</i>

24:34.882 --> 24:37.186
<i>and something
had changed in her.</i>

24:41.629 --> 24:43.733
I think we should get
a divorce.

24:47.908 --> 24:50.045
<i>Right then, he was filled
with an aching love for her</i>

24:50.045 --> 24:52.785
<i>that he hadn't experienced
in some time.</i>

24:56.091 --> 24:57.861
It's gonna be okay.

25:26.218 --> 25:27.921
<i>Well done.</i>

25:27.921 --> 25:29.190
<i>I gotta go.</i>

25:29.190 --> 25:30.927
Okay. Bye.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.003
How can I? I have no phone.

25:52.003 --> 25:54.775
Alright.
I'm sure you'll find a way.

25:54.775 --> 25:56.779
Here you go.

25:56.779 --> 26:00.654
This will barely
buy me water.

26:00.654 --> 26:01.989
Alright, here's 20.

26:01.989 --> 26:03.292
Okay. Bye.

26:03.292 --> 26:05.296
Good time.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.066
Bye, Hannah.

26:13.913 --> 26:15.282
Wait, Hannah...

26:18.857 --> 26:21.996
Who's she talking to?

26:21.996 --> 26:23.933
I don't know, Sol.

26:28.074 --> 26:29.912
Hmm.
Hot enough for you?

26:29.912 --> 26:32.049
Nice to see you, Roxanne.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.187
<i>Roxanne Hertz spoke
in a Groucho Marx voice</i>

26:34.187 --> 26:36.692
<i>when she was saying anything
uncomfortable or critical</i>

26:36.692 --> 26:38.763
<i>or evenly mildly controversial.</i>

26:38.763 --> 26:40.366
Can you believe
he's the nominee?

26:40.366 --> 26:41.769
It's hilarious.

26:41.769 --> 26:44.007
Well, at least she'll win, right?

26:44.007 --> 26:45.777
Well, I don't know
that she'll win.

26:45.777 --> 26:48.348
I don't even like her that
much, but at least with him,

26:48.348 --> 26:50.419
we can keep our money,
you know?

26:50.419 --> 26:52.691
Also, her voice--
drives Rich crazy.

26:52.691 --> 26:55.196
Anyway, I was thinking that
I could pick the girls up

26:55.196 --> 26:56.666
and take them to dinner.

26:56.666 --> 26:58.302
Yeah, you know what,
Hannah would probably prefer

26:58.302 --> 26:59.705
that to having dinner with me,
so--

26:59.705 --> 27:00.907
Oh, Solly. Yeah.

27:00.907 --> 27:02.945
Solly, do you want
to go play with Max?

27:02.945 --> 27:04.247
He's in the car.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.951
Oh.
Do you want to, buddy?

27:05.951 --> 27:07.220
Oh, of--
of course he does.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.388
Does he?
Yeah.

27:08.388 --> 27:10.092
Okay.
Okay.

27:10.092 --> 27:11.996
I'll-- I'll pick you up
for dinner, okay?
Okay.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.967
Oh, let them stay.
Hannah can call you

27:13.967 --> 27:14.869
when we're done.

27:14.869 --> 27:16.338
Actually, you know what?
Do-- Do you mind?

27:16.338 --> 27:17.841
She doesn't have
a phone yet.

27:17.841 --> 27:18.843
Still?
Yeah.

27:18.843 --> 27:20.312
Toby, get that girl a phone.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.855
Oh, you are looking
so well, Toby.

27:24.855 --> 27:27.694
You know, I keep meaning
to tell you,

27:27.694 --> 27:30.734
we are your friend, too,
and, um, yeah--

27:30.734 --> 27:34.808
I'm idling.
Oh. Okay.

27:34.808 --> 27:37.413
Gotta go.

27:37.413 --> 27:39.083
<i>Toby was unsettled by the fact</i>

27:39.083 --> 27:41.254
<i>that Roxanne Hertz
didn't blink when she saw</i>

27:41.254 --> 27:43.425
<i>that Toby was the one
with the kids and not Rachel.</i>

27:43.425 --> 27:46.164
Bye! Bye, Toby!

27:46.164 --> 27:48.435
<i>Had she heard from Rachel?</i>

27:48.435 --> 27:51.107
<i>Did she know something
he didn't?</i>

27:51.107 --> 27:52.844
<i>I'm beginning to think,
like, maybe</i>

27:52.844 --> 27:54.380
<i>I'm the only one
who doesn't know, right?</i>

27:54.380 --> 27:56.418
Well, did she say anything?
Arm circles.

27:56.418 --> 27:57.854
<i>No. No, no, no.
That's just it.</i>

27:57.854 --> 27:59.725
<i>That's what's so weird.</i>

27:59.725 --> 28:01.127
No, I think she probably
just assumed

28:01.127 --> 28:03.900
there was a good reason--
like, she did the math.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.404
The woman who said this to me
was not the smartest person.

28:06.404 --> 28:08.008
5, 6, 7, 8.
Okay, I gotta--

28:08.008 --> 28:09.410
I have to go, but if this--

28:09.410 --> 28:11.448
if this were a story,
I would follow the money.

28:11.448 --> 28:12.851
What does that mean?
Does--

28:12.851 --> 28:14.153
Is that something people
really say?

28:14.153 --> 28:15.790
<i>You had bank accounts
together, right?</i>

28:15.790 --> 28:18.128
So, just see where she's
spending her money, right?

28:18.128 --> 28:20.032
Okay, I got-- I--
I have to go, Toby.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.301
Okay. Okay, bye.
Alright. Bye.

28:43.244 --> 28:45.048
Hello?

28:51.127 --> 28:52.463
Hello?

28:52.463 --> 28:54.367
Who is that?

28:54.367 --> 28:56.338
Uh, um, this is my house?

28:56.338 --> 28:58.408
Who-- Who are you?

28:58.408 --> 29:00.079
Miss Fleishman didn't
mention a visitor.

29:00.079 --> 29:02.216
Well, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry, who are you?

29:02.216 --> 29:04.153
I look in on the place.

29:04.153 --> 29:06.926
Oh. No, it's fine.
Like, I'm her husband.

29:06.926 --> 29:09.063
I promise this--
this is all fine.

29:11.501 --> 29:14.374
Okay.
Yeah. Okay.

29:14.374 --> 29:15.510
I'll come back. Yeah.

29:15.510 --> 29:17.380
I mean, we'll be out
by the weekend.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.183
Thanks.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.500
Great.

29:32.376 --> 29:34.948
Okay. Thank you.

29:39.223 --> 29:41.261
<i>Fine.
He would follow the money.</i>

29:56.625 --> 29:58.395
<i>Three months before,
he'd divested</i>

29:58.395 --> 30:02.236
<i>of their shared accounts,
handing them over to Rachel.</i>

30:02.236 --> 30:05.008
<i>The mediator had told her to
change their shared passwords,</i>

30:05.008 --> 30:07.380
<i>that it was an important
part of moving on.</i>

30:11.154 --> 30:13.425
<i>Toby couldn't believe
she'd actually done it.</i>

30:16.297 --> 30:19.237
Sweet Jesus,
is the sun broken?

30:19.237 --> 30:22.309
<i>His phone passcode
was still their anniversary,</i>

30:22.309 --> 30:24.280
<i>and her password was what?</i>

30:24.280 --> 30:27.052
<i>Something he couldn't
even begin to imagine.</i>

31:04.193 --> 31:05.597
That's him.

31:13.311 --> 31:16.217
<i>And with that, it was time
to leave the house,</i>

31:16.217 --> 31:18.088
<i>into which he was,
he was learning,</i>

31:18.088 --> 31:19.457
<i>technically breaking
and entering.</i>

31:19.457 --> 31:21.929
Yeah, sorry.

31:21.929 --> 31:24.033
Bye, Toby.

31:24.033 --> 31:25.369
Bye.
Thank you for having them.

31:25.369 --> 31:27.507
Bye!
Bye, Fleishmans!

31:27.507 --> 31:30.179
Thanks a lot.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.982
They were about to take us
out to dinner.

31:31.982 --> 31:33.385
It's so unfair.
Yeah, I have a patient
I need to see.

31:33.385 --> 31:34.621
Get in the car.
Come on.

31:34.621 --> 31:36.357
<i>He didn't belong here.</i>

31:39.130 --> 31:41.969
<i>She had moved on,
and he was still using the pool</i>

31:41.969 --> 31:46.044
<i>like a house guest
who wouldn't go home.</i>

31:46.044 --> 31:49.250
<i>God damn, if Rachel
could move on, so could he.</i>

31:49.250 --> 31:52.623
Who wants to go to E.J.'s?
Breakfast for dinner!

31:55.563 --> 31:58.368
Alright.
I have to do one errand first.

32:08.421 --> 32:10.492
<i>Toby was going
to take control.</i>

32:24.153 --> 32:25.623
Thank you!

32:32.403 --> 32:34.040
Thank you so much.

32:46.030 --> 32:50.038
<i>On the wind of this triumph,</i>

32:50.038 --> 32:52.510
<i>he decided to solve
his bigger problem.</i>

32:52.510 --> 32:55.449
Hey, Hannah, h-how psyched
are you for camp?

32:55.449 --> 32:57.687
Mm-hmm.

32:57.687 --> 32:59.290
Boy, am I jealous.

32:59.290 --> 33:01.194
You know, I met all of my
best friends at camp.

33:01.194 --> 33:04.200
You know Seth?
He and I met at camp.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.471
Do you think we could make
this have a six-foot diameter,

33:06.471 --> 33:08.141
or is that too big?

33:08.141 --> 33:10.178
Yeah, six feet-- Yeah,
it might be a little too big,

33:10.178 --> 33:13.218
especially in this
tiny apartment.

33:13.218 --> 33:15.088
You know, that's where I first
learned about astronomy,

33:15.088 --> 33:18.461
'cause they have these, like,
amazing telescopes at camp.

33:18.461 --> 33:20.465
Yeah. They don't have
all those city lights

33:20.465 --> 33:21.735
to obstruct the stars.

33:21.735 --> 33:23.071
Actually, you--
you might like that, Sol.

33:23.071 --> 33:25.709
Nope.
Remember, I'm not a camp kid.

33:28.181 --> 33:30.587
Yeah, he's not a camp kid, Rachel.

33:30.587 --> 33:32.156
Who is?

33:32.156 --> 33:34.193
You're a camp kid because
your parents send you to camp.

33:34.193 --> 33:36.097
All his friends
started last year.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.333
No, he doesn't have
any friends.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.636
That's because he doesn't
go to camp.

33:38.636 --> 33:39.738
Well...
If he doesn't go now,

33:39.738 --> 33:41.508
he'll be too freaked out
to go later.

33:41.508 --> 33:43.078
Wait,
he wanted to go that--

33:43.078 --> 33:45.482
uh, that ice skating camp
in Queens, you remember?

33:45.482 --> 33:47.252
Who's he gonna meet
at an ice skating camp?

33:47.252 --> 33:48.856
Uh, I don't know.
Not everybody goes to camp

33:48.856 --> 33:50.392
for, like, networking
opportunities, Rachel.

33:50.392 --> 33:52.530
Why doesn't he want to do
something more appropriate,

33:52.530 --> 33:55.235
like... tennis?

33:55.235 --> 33:56.605
Wait, is that it?
Are you just, like,

33:56.605 --> 33:57.774
concerned about
his masculinity?

33:57.774 --> 33:59.210
No.

33:59.210 --> 34:00.479
C-Can't we cultivate
something more practical?

34:00.479 --> 34:03.753
Like, he's not gonna grow up
to be an ice skater.

34:03.753 --> 34:05.088
And-- And we should be concerned

34:05.088 --> 34:07.092
that he doesn't want
to leave home.

34:07.092 --> 34:09.096
Why are you, like, so eager
to get rid of them?

34:09.096 --> 34:10.800
Didn't, like--
Didn't we want them?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.271
They're gonna be gone
soon enough.

34:13.271 --> 34:15.677
No, I-I'm not paying
for ice skating camp.

34:15.677 --> 34:18.683
Okay. There it is.
Honesty. Finally.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.118
It's your money.

34:20.118 --> 34:22.423
What? No.
That's not what I said at all.

34:22.423 --> 34:23.593
<i>It went on like that.</i>

34:23.593 --> 34:26.431
<i>He tore through her
for her lack of participation</i>

34:26.431 --> 34:27.499
<i>in the kids' lives.</i>

34:27.499 --> 34:29.671
<i>She went straight for
his masculinity like it</i>

34:29.671 --> 34:31.107
<i>was an artery.</i>

34:31.107 --> 34:32.409
That's how you're thinking?
Okay, thank you.

34:32.409 --> 34:34.113
I knew you'd find a way
to turn it back to me.

34:34.113 --> 34:36.117
No, actually, I'm just asking
a question, Toby.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.252
It's an honest question.

34:37.252 --> 34:39.123
Can I get Instagram?
Everyone has it.

34:39.123 --> 34:40.258
No, we've answered this before.

34:40.258 --> 34:42.396
No social media
until you're 13.

34:42.396 --> 34:43.498
<i>Everyone.</i>

34:43.498 --> 34:44.835
No-- You don't even have
a phone.

34:44.835 --> 34:46.304
It's not good for kids
and anxiety.

34:46.304 --> 34:47.807
Your brain is still
developing, alright?

34:47.807 --> 34:49.243
Dad and I will talk about it.
Excuse me.

34:49.243 --> 34:50.813
We've already talked about it, okay?

34:50.813 --> 34:53.251
How about my anxiety that
everybody is always on it

34:53.251 --> 34:55.389
and leaving me out?
She has a point.

34:55.389 --> 34:57.158
Yeah?

35:08.448 --> 35:10.251
You're an animal.

35:16.765 --> 35:18.803
<i>Toby wasn't proud of
everything that went down</i>

35:18.803 --> 35:20.572
<i>at the end of his marriage.</i>

35:24.514 --> 35:27.954
<i>But he was now beginning
to see camp for what it was--</i>

35:27.954 --> 35:33.364
<i>not a weapon in his cold war
with Rachel, but a solution.</i>

35:33.364 --> 35:37.206
Hey, Sol, I-I need
to talk to you, buddy.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.611
Am I in trouble?
No, no, of course not.

35:39.611 --> 35:42.349
No. Um, I just, um--

35:42.349 --> 35:45.757
I need you to think
about going to camp.

35:45.757 --> 35:47.861
But I'm not a camp kid.

35:47.861 --> 35:49.263
Yeah. Yeah.

35:49.263 --> 35:52.871
The thing is, Mom is away for
a while and I have to work, okay?

35:52.871 --> 35:54.741
That's just, like,
what's going on.

35:54.741 --> 35:57.312
Your options are sitting in
the conference room at the hospital

35:57.312 --> 36:00.787
or spending time at aftercare
at the Y, and I just--

36:00.787 --> 36:03.926
I just want
a better summer for you.

36:03.926 --> 36:07.634
I mean, you deserve
a better summer.

36:07.634 --> 36:09.336
What about if I hate it?

36:09.336 --> 36:10.606
Well, then,
I'll come pick you up,

36:10.606 --> 36:11.875
but I don't think
you're gonna hate it.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.579
What about my project?

36:13.579 --> 36:15.248
What? Your project?
We'll have plenty of time

36:15.248 --> 36:18.656
to do your project
when you get back home.

36:18.656 --> 36:23.231
Can I think about it?

36:23.231 --> 36:28.509
I-I think what I'm saying
is that, um, you're going.

36:28.509 --> 36:30.378
But you're gonna be fine.
I would not--

36:30.378 --> 36:34.252
I would not put you anywhere
that is bad or dangerous, okay?

36:37.292 --> 36:38.796
Come here, buddy.

36:44.775 --> 36:47.412
<i>He sent the kids to bed and
kept the date that he'd had</i>

36:47.412 --> 36:49.818
<i>with Nahid, the woman that
he'd been communicating with</i>

36:49.818 --> 36:51.655
<i>on his app for several weeks.</i>

36:51.655 --> 36:54.828
<i>According to Seth, the hotter
it gets before you real-life</i>

36:54.828 --> 36:56.532
<i>meet a woman from
a dating app,</i>

36:56.532 --> 36:58.669
<i>the more it predicts
you'll never actually meet.</i>

36:58.669 --> 37:01.675
<i>The human confines of shame
can't withstand it.</i>

37:01.675 --> 37:04.848
<i>And surely, it had gotten hot
with Nahid.</i>

37:04.848 --> 37:06.417
<i>And weird.</i>

37:06.417 --> 37:07.987
<i>Okay, I'm a super,
but the payment</i>

37:07.987 --> 37:09.691
<i>I demand for changing
a light bulb</i>

37:09.691 --> 37:11.662
<i>is for you to go down on me
until I'm done.</i>

37:11.662 --> 37:13.666
<i>But now, my kids
are beating down the door</i>

37:13.666 --> 37:17.272
<i>and I scream,
"I'm coming! I'm coming!"</i>

37:17.272 --> 37:18.709
<i>You're a fighter pilot
who is too horny to fight,</i>

37:18.709 --> 37:23.686
<i>so you have me sit on your
cock while you fight Russian bogeys.</i>

37:23.686 --> 37:25.690
<i>I'm a space alien
dressed as a window washer</i>

37:25.690 --> 37:27.727
<i>who is doing your windows,

37:27.727 --> 37:29.564
<i>"I can't come in unless
I write your name</i>

37:29.564 --> 37:31.969
<i>on the window, but I don't
have a writing implement,</i>

37:31.969 --> 37:34.574
<i>except for my space penis.</i>

37:38.682 --> 37:41.989
<i>Yeah. As a scientist, Toby</i> could
<i>not dismiss the</i> possibility

37:41.989 --> 37:43.959
<i>that Nahid was too good
to be true.</i>

37:43.959 --> 37:45.696
Whoa!

37:47.600 --> 37:50.472
<i>But scientists must always see
their experiment through,</i>

37:50.472 --> 37:54.581
<i>no matter how much the
forecast calls for spectacular failure.</i>

38:03.799 --> 38:05.468
Hi.

38:06.805 --> 38:08.742
Hi.

38:10.044 --> 38:11.948
Yeah. Thanks.

38:14.821 --> 38:17.492
<i>Toby always loved summer.</i>

38:35.963 --> 38:38.935
Oof.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.958
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

38:49.958 --> 38:51.494
Did something happen?

38:51.494 --> 38:53.732
Is Mommy dead?

38:53.732 --> 38:56.037
Oh, my God.
Of-- Of course not.

38:56.037 --> 38:58.408
Why? Why?
What-- What happened?

38:58.408 --> 38:59.945
I tried to call her.

38:59.945 --> 39:02.082
Yeah, well, maybe she
doesn't have your number.

39:02.082 --> 39:04.688
I texted her and I said,
"It's Hannah."

39:04.688 --> 39:06.758
Yeah.
I-- You know what?

39:06.758 --> 39:08.963
I spoke to her
a little while ago.

39:08.963 --> 39:11.434
I think she's just really
busy, and maybe--

39:11.434 --> 39:13.037
maybe she's just asleep now.

39:13.037 --> 39:14.708
Come here, kiddo.

39:14.708 --> 39:17.112
It's okay.

39:17.112 --> 39:18.882
It's okay, sweetheart.

39:20.919 --> 39:22.624
You know, she'd be here
right now

39:22.624 --> 39:28.001
if she didn't hate you
so much.

39:39.991 --> 39:41.728
<i>And then it was
a few days later,</i>

39:41.728 --> 39:43.498
<i>and it occurred to Toby
that he was doing</i>

39:43.498 --> 39:45.603
<i>exactly what Rachel
would have done.</i>

39:45.603 --> 39:47.172
<i>He was throwing money
at the problem.</i>

39:47.172 --> 39:49.076
<i>He was buying summer.</i>

39:51.748 --> 39:52.917
Okay, let's go.
Whoa, whoa.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.921
No, no. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

39:54.921 --> 39:56.758
Hey.

39:56.758 --> 39:58.629
I want you to know that
in the block universe,

39:58.629 --> 39:59.964
you have been at camp,

39:59.964 --> 40:02.637
having the most amazing summer
for all of time, okay?

40:02.637 --> 40:04.006
This is so stupid.

40:04.006 --> 40:07.479
And I-I want you to know
that also in the block universe,

40:07.479 --> 40:08.882
you are already back
at home with me,

40:08.882 --> 40:11.721
telling me about
your amazing adventures, okay?

40:13.190 --> 40:15.629
I love you, Dad.

40:15.629 --> 40:18.669
Okay, Chipmunks,
time to load up!
Love you, too.

40:18.669 --> 40:21.842
Okay. Listen, you let them
know if you need anything, okay?

40:21.842 --> 40:23.912
I will think about you
non-stop.

40:23.912 --> 40:26.818
Hey. You stay.

40:26.818 --> 40:32.129
I know you think you hate me,
but I also know that you
don't.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.965
I'm gonna miss you so much, okay?

40:51.535 --> 40:54.206
- Bye.
- Bye!

40:54.206 --> 40:59.951
- Bye, sweetie.
- Love you.

41:02.824 --> 41:05.896
<i>They were gone now.
Everyone was gone.</i>

41:05.896 --> 41:08.969
<i>It was too much for him.
It was too awful.</i>

41:16.551 --> 41:18.555
<i>But also, they were gone.</i>

41:24.601 --> 41:26.972
<i>And they're off.</i>

41:26.972 --> 41:28.575
<i>You guys around?</i>

41:35.890 --> 41:37.794
<i>He could have a second
to think now.</i>

41:37.794 --> 41:39.263
<i>He could pull himself together</i>

41:39.263 --> 41:41.133
<i>and start to try to remember
what kind of life</i>

41:41.133 --> 41:43.839
<i>he was trying to build
before all of this happened.</i>

41:43.839 --> 41:46.110
<i>He could stop vamping
for his kids for a minute</i>

41:46.110 --> 41:48.114
<i>and perhaps join the throngs
of people</i>

41:48.114 --> 41:50.151
<i>who met in twos and threes
with their friends</i>

41:50.151 --> 41:53.257
<i>in park
and drank rosé out of cans.</i>

41:53.257 --> 41:56.063
<i>He was going to try a Negroni!</i>

41:56.063 --> 41:58.267
<i>He was gonna have
his summer, too.</i>

42:00.873 --> 42:02.142
Is it called a ladies night?

42:02.142 --> 42:03.344
No, it's not called
a ladies night.

42:03.344 --> 42:04.747
It's called
a mom's night.

42:04.747 --> 42:06.751
Ah.
Yeah. Like, a mom's--

42:06.751 --> 42:07.920
Like, I don't--
I don't even know.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.089
Why-- Why even have
a mom's night, you know?

42:09.089 --> 42:10.626
Why do we need
a mom's night out?

42:10.626 --> 42:12.229
Isn't the actual problem--
Hey.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.901
Hi.
...the existence
of a mom's night out?

42:14.901 --> 42:17.005
Like, how can we bear to admit
that we're in a cage

42:17.005 --> 42:20.613
and have to be liberated,
prowl the streets,

42:20.613 --> 42:24.754
drinking Aperol Spritzes
in our blousey tops.

42:24.754 --> 42:26.157
God.
You know what the secret is?

42:26.157 --> 42:27.627
What's the secret?

42:27.627 --> 42:28.896
The secret is nobody
even wants to be there.

42:28.896 --> 42:30.198
We just want to be left alone,
you know?

42:30.198 --> 42:31.635
Like, we want to
be left alone.

42:31.635 --> 42:32.770
We don't need some
organized activity.

42:32.770 --> 42:34.039
Just let me watch TV
by myself.

42:34.039 --> 42:35.776
But those women need to be
let out of the cage.

42:35.776 --> 42:36.978
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

42:36.978 --> 42:39.049
Maybe I'm just different
than they are.

42:39.049 --> 42:41.120
They need to prowl the streets
with their Aperol Spritz.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.723
You know what I mean?
Am I, like, speaking

42:42.723 --> 42:44.961
some unspoken truth
that we all share,

42:44.961 --> 42:47.265
or am I really just
very different from them?

42:47.265 --> 42:49.904
It's pretty intense.

42:49.904 --> 42:53.812
It's a shame, the thing
that happens to women.

42:55.682 --> 42:57.052
What's going on with you?

42:57.052 --> 42:59.056
Hmm? Oh.

42:59.056 --> 43:00.158
Sorry, uh...

43:00.158 --> 43:02.195
I was so looking forward
to coming here, and then--

43:02.195 --> 43:05.669
I mean, I just sent
my kids off to camp

43:05.669 --> 43:07.072
because I didn't want
to tell them

43:07.072 --> 43:08.942
that their mother has decided
that she needs yoga more

43:08.942 --> 43:11.013
than she wants
to be a mother.

43:11.013 --> 43:12.850
Sorry. I'm distracted.
I'm sorry.

43:12.850 --> 43:14.754
Is she still gone?
Yeah.

43:14.754 --> 43:16.390
I mean, look, she does this, okay,

43:16.390 --> 43:19.396
but I'm starting to think
that it hasn't really gone on

43:19.396 --> 43:21.100
this long, you know?

43:21.100 --> 43:23.404
She normally, like, delights
in sending me eye-roll emojis

43:23.404 --> 43:24.941
whenever I complain,

43:24.941 --> 43:26.811
but this is like a whole
new level, just going dark.

43:26.811 --> 43:28.682
Have you gone to the office
or the yoga place?

43:28.682 --> 43:30.686
Have you called the yoga place
or her assistant?

43:30.686 --> 43:31.955
I mean, I would march
right in.

43:31.955 --> 43:33.090
I don't have to call her
assistant, okay?

43:33.090 --> 43:34.961
I want her to be normal.

43:34.961 --> 43:36.430
And yes, I called the
assistant, and of course,

43:36.430 --> 43:37.833
I called
the yoga place, too.

43:37.833 --> 43:39.236
Yeah.
I got nothing.

43:39.236 --> 43:42.977
Well, man, I think when you
stop having sex

43:42.977 --> 43:45.716
with somebody,
all bets are off.

43:45.716 --> 43:48.120
Well, actually,
we were still having sex.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.256
My man.

43:49.256 --> 43:50.726
What?
My man.

43:50.726 --> 43:51.795
No, it's not
that kind of--
My man.

43:51.795 --> 43:52.997
It's not, like, a happy thing.

43:52.997 --> 43:54.734
My man. My man. Yeah.

43:54.734 --> 43:56.270
It's weird. I would-- I would
drop the kids off, and she--

43:56.270 --> 43:57.974
she would say that she needs
to talk to me

43:57.974 --> 43:59.711
about something privately,
so we'd go into our bedroom,

43:59.711 --> 44:01.781
or her bedroom, I guess.
I don't know.

44:01.781 --> 44:02.984
She wouldn't even
turn the lights on.

44:02.984 --> 44:05.923
We would just, like, start.

44:05.923 --> 44:07.392
And then what happened?
Don't.

44:07.392 --> 44:08.729
You know how it works, right?

44:08.729 --> 44:09.998
Uh-huh.
Right.

44:09.998 --> 44:11.400
And then, uh, I don't know,
it was over

44:11.400 --> 44:12.870
and she would roll over
and pretend to fall asleep

44:12.870 --> 44:15.141
and I would
just quietly leave.

44:15.141 --> 44:16.310
It's weird.

44:16.310 --> 44:18.014
I don't mind it.

44:18.014 --> 44:20.184
It's like a hundred
little goodbyes.

44:30.371 --> 44:31.875
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

44:31.875 --> 44:33.077
You know, I thought it would
be over and I would--

44:33.077 --> 44:34.814
I wouldn't think
about her anymore,

44:34.814 --> 44:36.016
but like, my brain
keeps remembering everything.

44:36.016 --> 44:37.285
Like-- Like, trying
to determine

44:37.285 --> 44:38.789
if I could have seen
this coming.

44:38.789 --> 44:40.759
I literally can't stop
thinking about her.

44:44.466 --> 44:46.938
But you're not worried
about her?

44:46.938 --> 44:49.176
No. I mean, she does this.
She does?

44:49.176 --> 44:50.980
Yes, she does this,
like an extra three days

44:50.980 --> 44:52.215
on a business trip,
or we wake up

44:52.215 --> 44:54.186
and she's not there,
and she works all day

44:54.186 --> 44:56.791
and we only see her the next
morning, like a million times.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.929
Really.
That I actually
do understand.

44:58.929 --> 45:00.465
I used to really like being
on a story

45:00.465 --> 45:03.070
and, you know,
staying an extra day.

45:03.070 --> 45:05.776
Yeah, but now, it's longer
than just an extra day or two.

45:05.776 --> 45:07.813
Yeah. No, I've never heard
of this before,

45:07.813 --> 45:09.116
and I would always
call, like...

45:09.116 --> 45:11.320
Right. You're a normal,
you know, person.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.324
Thank you.
'Cause what if something
had happened to you?

45:13.324 --> 45:14.493
Well, yeah, exactly.

45:14.493 --> 45:17.833
What if something
has happened to her?

45:21.440 --> 45:22.943
No, she's...

45:22.943 --> 45:24.346
What?
Nothing.

45:24.346 --> 45:26.182
She...
What is it?

45:27.051 --> 45:29.222
A few years back,
she went to some work thing.

45:29.222 --> 45:31.895
She got home really late,
like at 3:00 AM,

45:31.895 --> 45:33.097
and I had called her, okay?

45:33.097 --> 45:34.534
And she didn't answer,
as usual,

45:34.534 --> 45:35.836
because that's just
what she did,

45:35.836 --> 45:37.105
and I wasn't worried
about her.

45:37.105 --> 45:38.508
She never checked in
when she was running late.

45:38.508 --> 45:39.944
I mean, I was always
a second thought,

45:39.944 --> 45:41.179
and this is while
we were married.

45:41.179 --> 45:43.952
Anyway, she stumbles in,
and she's not drunk or anything,

45:43.952 --> 45:46.223
and she, like,
passes out on the couch,

45:46.223 --> 45:50.498
and I realize--
I mean, she had been roofied.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.835
What?
Yeah.

45:51.835 --> 45:52.937
No.
Yeah.

45:52.937 --> 45:54.239
No, I mean--
No, nothing had happened to her.

45:54.239 --> 45:56.377
No, I think some employee
of hers saw that she was, like,

45:56.377 --> 45:57.980
a little out of it and
brought her home immediately,

45:57.980 --> 46:01.521
but I just-- I--

46:01.521 --> 46:08.067
I keep remembering this, like,
terrible, tiny moment, and, um,

46:08.067 --> 46:10.104
I'm actually kind of, like,
ashamed to admit it,

46:10.104 --> 46:13.377
but, um, but after I knew
that she was safe,

46:13.377 --> 46:16.116
once I knew that nothing worse
had happened,

46:16.116 --> 46:19.456
I felt like--
just briefly, like, just for,

46:19.456 --> 46:21.126
like, one second, though, like,

46:21.126 --> 46:23.865
relieved, you know, that
she hadn't just forgotten to--

46:23.865 --> 46:25.201
to call me, you know?

46:25.201 --> 46:27.472
She hadn't just forgotten
that I existed.

46:27.472 --> 46:30.344
She didn't forget to call
home. She couldn't.

46:30.344 --> 46:32.282
You know, what a relief that
this wasn't just another time

46:32.282 --> 46:36.423
where she was treating me
like shit, you know?

46:36.423 --> 46:37.893
Wow.
Yeah.

46:37.893 --> 46:39.029
I mean, I'm not proud of this,
you know?

46:39.029 --> 46:42.068
But I keep thinking about it.

46:42.068 --> 46:44.406
Yeah.
But I mean, she does this.

46:44.406 --> 46:46.410
Right?

46:46.410 --> 46:48.147
I mean, she does this.

46:50.151 --> 46:52.590
Unless, what if something
happened to her?

46:52.590 --> 46:54.894
Yeah.
But no, nothing happened to her.

46:54.894 --> 46:56.330
No.
Nothing happened to her.

46:56.330 --> 46:57.499
Are you okay, Toby?

46:57.499 --> 46:58.969
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:58.969 --> 47:00.939
Shit. Sorry.

47:00.939 --> 47:02.442
Sorry. Fuck.

47:02.442 --> 47:03.912
Yeah, Dr. Fleishman.

47:03.912 --> 47:05.381
<i>Toby, I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

47:05.381 --> 47:07.218
<i>We have a 22-year-old
in fulminant liver failure.</i>

47:07.218 --> 47:08.922
Yeah.
<i>We can't figure it out.</i>

47:08.922 --> 47:10.191
Okay.
No, I'll be--

47:10.191 --> 47:12.462
Shit, I'll be right in.
Sorry, I gotta go.

47:12.462 --> 47:14.266
My fellows need me.
I have a young patient.

47:14.266 --> 47:15.936
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah.

47:15.936 --> 47:17.439
Sorry.
I just-- I gotta go.

47:22.315 --> 47:24.218
Whoa!

47:26.089 --> 47:27.358
Heads up!

47:27.358 --> 47:28.595
Hey!
Sorry!

47:28.595 --> 47:30.198
Watch where you're going!

47:30.198 --> 47:32.068
<i>Suddenly, he saw danger everywhere.</i>

47:32.068 --> 47:34.607
<i>Suddenly, he couldn't conceive
of the version of the person</i>

47:34.607 --> 47:36.276
<i>he was even 10 minutes ago,</i>

47:36.276 --> 47:38.214
<i>who hadn't thought
to ask hard questions</i>

47:38.214 --> 47:41.654
<i>about his ex-wife's
disappearance.</i>

47:41.654 --> 47:43.290
<i>He'd been so busy
taking a tour</i>

47:43.290 --> 47:45.294
<i>of the block universe
of his marriage</i>

47:45.294 --> 47:47.633
<i>that he had forgotten
to stay in the now,</i>

47:47.633 --> 47:49.504
<i>where there was an emergency.</i>

47:52.108 --> 47:54.346
<i>He wasn't okay.
He was worried.</i>

47:54.346 --> 47:56.618
<i>He suddenly felt very foolish
for not having thought</i>

47:56.618 --> 47:59.389
<i>through the fact that yes,
she was a terrible person,</i>

47:59.389 --> 48:02.095
<i>but bad things happen
to terrible people, too.</i>

48:04.700 --> 48:06.638
Hello?
<i>I'm so embarrassed.</i>

48:06.638 --> 48:08.174
<i>It's an overdose.</i>

48:08.174 --> 48:09.644
<i>We hadn't gotten back
the acetaminophen report.</i>

48:09.644 --> 48:11.180
Wait, wait, sorry, do you
still need me to come in?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.650
<i>No, no, no.
W-We're fine.</i>

48:12.650 --> 48:15.121
<i>I'm so sorry to disturb you.
I'm really embarrassed.</i>

48:15.121 --> 48:16.658
<i>Okay. No.
No, it's okay.</i>

48:26.644 --> 48:28.314
<i>Probably nothing was wrong.</i>

48:28.314 --> 48:31.053
<i>Probably she was fine and just
being her normal,</i>

48:31.053 --> 48:32.422
<i>inconsiderate self.</i>

48:32.422 --> 48:34.025
<i>He needed to pull himself together.</i>

48:34.025 --> 48:35.596
<i>He needed some citrus.</i>

48:35.596 --> 48:38.668
<i>He needed some produce.</i>

48:38.668 --> 48:41.206
<i>This was what
summer wrought--</i>

48:41.206 --> 48:44.547
<i>heat and terror
and rotting fruit.</i>

48:44.547 --> 48:46.283
<i>Honestly, fuck summer.</i>

48:46.283 --> 48:49.155
<i>Summer was marketing.
Summer was a scam.</i>

48:51.460 --> 48:54.165
Simone. Yeah, Simone.
Hi, it's Toby.

48:54.165 --> 48:56.638
I'm sor-- Yeah, where--
where is Rachel?

48:56.638 --> 48:59.142
Okay. No, I--
I know she has the week off.

48:59.142 --> 49:02.448
Yeah, but you must--
you must have spoken to her.

49:02.448 --> 49:04.286
Okay. Okay.
No, that's fine-- I'll--

49:04.286 --> 49:06.156
I'll-- I will try her there.

49:06.156 --> 49:07.292
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:07.292 --> 49:08.628
Will you look at that?

49:08.628 --> 49:12.302
Two Fleishman sightings
in one day. Hi.

49:12.302 --> 49:14.339
I love a husband
doing food shopping

49:14.339 --> 49:15.742
in the middle of the day.

49:15.742 --> 49:18.047
Toby, are you still
into yoga?

49:18.047 --> 49:20.484
Sam's getting into yoga.
Todd is gonna try it.

49:20.484 --> 49:23.357
He swears. Well, he says
after our Rome trip.

49:23.357 --> 49:25.261
Did Hannah tell you
we're going to Rome?

49:25.261 --> 49:26.463
I swear, she and Lexi are--

49:26.463 --> 49:28.200
I'm sorry, wait,
two Fleishman sightings?

49:28.200 --> 49:30.639
I-- The kids
just went to camp.

49:30.639 --> 49:34.379
We just saw Rachel.

49:34.379 --> 49:35.716
What?

49:35.716 --> 49:38.187
She was napping
in the park.

49:38.187 --> 49:40.324
Yeah. Yeah.
It was the craziest thing.

49:40.324 --> 49:43.330
She was just lying there, napping.

49:43.330 --> 49:46.738
Just...
<i>Miriam said something,</i>

49:46.738 --> 49:49.109
<i>and then Cyndi talked for
either an hour more</i>

49:49.109 --> 49:53.518
<i>or a minute more, but Toby
didn't hear anything after that</i>

49:53.518 --> 49:55.622
<i>because his blood froze
and his inner ear</i>

49:55.622 --> 49:57.793
<i>started to bleed
and his brain turned to putty</i>

49:57.793 --> 50:00.364
<i>and began to leak out his
nose, and he knew right then,</i>

50:00.364 --> 50:03.772
<i>he would never understand
another thing ever again.</i>

51:17.184 --> 51:19.121
God how did this happen to me?
Seriously, like what did I do?

51:19.890 --> 51:20.825
This is amazing.

51:20.825 --> 51:22.328
The old place didn't
have air conditioning.

51:22.328 --> 51:24.332
It did. We had units.

51:24.734 --> 51:25.835
That's what I meant.

51:28.206 --> 51:31.380
Rachel... I don't know.
She's not like the type
to commit social suicide.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.589
We might need to revisit
what type of person we
think that she is.

51:35.589 --> 51:39.195
I don't feel sad. Just crazy.

51:39.195 --> 51:41.165
Yeah therapists
deal with crazy.

51:41.800 --> 51:42.602
You can't treat a
person that way!

51:42.602 --> 51:44.573
You don't know anything
about my life.

51:44.573 --> 51:48.180
You have punted every decision
that a person can make.

51:48.180 --> 51:51.185
I would like a place. I would
like to belong to people.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.189
I want something real.

51:53.390 --> 51:55.327
We all want everything.

51:56.196 --> 52:00.838
You really have no idea how
you would feel if you got the
thing that you wanted.
