<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:06.638
<i>In front of a live</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:08.340
[ laughter ]
Boyd, honey,

00:08.342 --> 00:11.010
That was
a wonderful Christmas show.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.945
Yeah, it was great.
All the favorites.
Yeah.

00:12.947 --> 00:15.948
"Frosty the Snowman,"
"Santa Claus is coming to town."

00:15.950 --> 00:17.783
You hate going to a concert
where the band says,

00:17.785 --> 00:19.952
"and now we're gonna do
some stuff off our new album."

00:20.787 --> 00:22.955
Enough dawdling
in the hallway, people.
Mike: Come on in.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.390
Not loving
this neighborhood.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.459
I've already got the nine
and the one dialed on my phone.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.228
Wow.
Look at this place.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.963
Look at this.
Yeah.

00:30.965 --> 00:34.533
It's beginning to look...
Nothing like Christmas.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.568
Honey,
where's your tree?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.871
Uh, in the forest,
where it belongs.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.673
There's a word for chopping down
a perfectly healthy tree --

00:41.675 --> 00:43.008
Murder.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.544
So, what's the word for
this wooden table here?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.112
"suicide"?
What is this?

00:47.747 --> 00:48.981
Speaking of murder,

00:48.983 --> 00:51.550
This bum fight downstairs
is getting real.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.153
Okay, w-- take -- take
your coats off. Can I
get you guys anything?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.387
Uh, do you have heat?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.922
Oh, I'll make
some hot cocoa, okay?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.991
Ryan made
some "holiday" cookies.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.692
Ooh.
Listen, honey.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.162
You and your class
sang with such enthusiasm.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.597
I could really feel
how much you wanted
that figgy pudding.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.900
♪ oh, bring us
some figgy pudding ♪

01:07.902 --> 01:10.669
♪ oh, bring us
some figgy pudding ♪
Boyd. Hey!
Zip-up-up-up!

01:10.671 --> 01:13.372
♪ oh, bring --
hey, nobody's holding up their
lighter for an encore, okay?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.374
You know, I just wish
the school had made
more of an effort

01:15.376 --> 01:17.743
To include traditions
from other cultures.
Mike: I don't know.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.013
I think it's refreshing
just having Christmas
rammed down our throat.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.215
Okay, michael, what about
people in the audience

01:23.217 --> 01:24.750
Who don't happen
to celebrate Christmas?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.385
Uh, maybe they
shouldn't go...
Ooh.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.288
...To something called
the "Christmas" concert.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.290
I don't
head to a luau and go,

01:31.292 --> 01:34.026
"what's with
all the hawaiian crap?"

01:34.028 --> 01:36.428
Are you forgetting
our honeymoon?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.131
No, these cookies
must be from last Christmas,

01:39.133 --> 01:40.632
'cause they're
as hard as a rock.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.001
Actually, Mandy,
those are called "pepparkakors."

01:44.037 --> 01:45.871
Swedes bake them to celebrate
the winter solstice.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.807
And, Vanessa, you're enjoying
a sesame-seed kwanzaa cookie,

01:48.809 --> 01:50.876
Popular among
african-americans.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.445
Are you sure? 'cause I
watch a lot of rap videos.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.380
They're never eating these
on a yacht.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.284
What is it about liberals
who just load up December

01:59.286 --> 02:01.320
With every holiday
that's just in December?

02:01.322 --> 02:02.821
You know what?
If we're at your house,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.823
You can celebrate the holidays
the way you like --

02:04.825 --> 02:07.326
With consumerism
and conspicuous consumption.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.928
And the birth
of the savior.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.965
I heard 18 songs
about jesus tonight.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.833
I'm pretty sure he's got
nothing to complain about.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.235
But now we're at my house,

02:16.237 --> 02:19.037
And we're gonna celebrate
the holidays the way I decide.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.742
Should I press the
last "one" in case
we need an ambulance?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.410
No. He's right.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.814
His beach, his ocean.
Mm. Well, you know what?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.083
We still have plenty
of Christmas at our house.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.619
We murdered
a huge tree this year.
Big tree.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.687
And, honey,
all your Christmas presents

02:35.689 --> 02:37.189
Are gonna be there
Christmas morning.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.459
Uh, a-actually, it'll be
more like the afternoon, mom.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.128
What? Y-you're not
bringing Boyd over
Christmas morning?

02:43.130 --> 02:46.331
And now is when
you're gonna want to
call that ambulance.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.934
I-I'm sorry, but we want
to open presents over here,

02:48.936 --> 02:51.103
While Ryan
plays his didgeridoo.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.774
It's an aboriginal
tradition.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.477
Uh...
Uh, y-- of course.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.445
Uh, it's fine.
Sure.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.548
I mean,
who wants to be awakened

03:02.550 --> 03:05.484
By the excitement of a child
on Christmas morning?

03:05.486 --> 03:06.818
I don't.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.988
Hey. Well, you made
the kid's grandma cry.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.723
So, what country's tradition
is that from?

03:13.893 --> 03:16.962
-- Captions by vitac --

03:21.000 --> 03:22.234
Mom, I-I know
you're disappointed

03:22.236 --> 03:23.802
We won't be here
Christmas morning.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.704
But I promise
you can count on us for dinner.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.140
Well, we can start
a new tradition --

03:28.142 --> 03:30.008
We could have dinner
at 7:00 a.M.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.811
Honey, we got to go.
W-w-wait. Wait.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.079
Uh, Boyd,
come here, honey. Come here.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.048
Grandma
has something for you.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.517
Boyd, meet elfie.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.986
Thanks, grandma.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.358
I'll use my imagination
to make it fun.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.661
Oh, honey, no.
Elfie is Santa's helper.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.531
He reports back to
Santa everything you
want for Christmas.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We'll do the same thing
we do every year.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.703
We write a letter. We
send it to the north pole.
It gets right to Santa.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.404
Yeah, but with climate change,
you better hurry up

03:59.406 --> 04:01.373
'cause that pole's headed
to the bottom of the ocean.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.541
You know what?

04:02.543 --> 04:05.077
None of that matters
because now Santa has elfie

04:05.079 --> 04:08.513
To tell him who's been naughty
and who's been nice.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.115
Cool.
I didn't know he was magic.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.284
So was chucky.
That didn't end well.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.023
Don't worry, elfie.
I'll be good!

04:18.025 --> 04:19.625
Vanessa, the toy
is really sweet.
Yeah.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.393
But, you know,
we don't want Boyd to behave

04:21.395 --> 04:23.528
Just because he thinks
he's being watched and judged

04:23.530 --> 04:25.063
By some
omniscient being.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.032
You don't need
to hear that.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.135
Mike, you just said
the elf was ridiculous.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.536
That's before I realized
you were against it.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.904
Now I'm gonna buy one.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.940
Ryan, can't we just
let this go?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.908
I mean,
elfie looks like fun.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.076
Okay. Fine.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.078
Look, son,
nobody's watching you, okay?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.913
It's just
a very nice doll.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.649
Oh.
Then, no thanks, grandma.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.484
Boys don't play
with dolls.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.985
Well, son, hold on.
That's a stereotype.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.787
Yeah.
Boys play with dolls.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.622
So you want me to
keep him?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.090
Well, that's up to you.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.726
But I want us to have an open
dialogue about the doll.

04:54.728 --> 04:58.130
I'm tired.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.932
We're all tired, Boyd.
You know what?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.501
Didn't we say that when
it comes to Christmas,

05:02.503 --> 05:04.136
I get to celebrate
with my family my way?

05:04.138 --> 05:06.104
Yeah, yeah, we did.
We said in your house.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.073
But l-look around.
Look. There's nice stuff.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.574
That would say that
we're in <i>my</i> house.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.942
And in my house,

05:10.944 --> 05:14.112
We don't celebrate
the navajo corn festival.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.981
We celebrate Christmas.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.283
And in case you haven't noticed,
there's a new sheriff in town,

05:18.285 --> 05:19.551
And his name's elfie.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.020
Boyd, I'll tell you what,

05:22.022 --> 05:23.522
Why don't -- why don't we
keep elfie here

05:23.524 --> 05:25.257
And you can play with him
whenever you come over?

05:25.259 --> 05:27.092
Right, and you can go home and
play with your didgeridoo-doo,

05:27.094 --> 05:28.694
Whatever that thing is.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.962
Honey, can we please go?
Okay, okay, okay.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.532
What do you say to
grandma for getting
you elfie, huh?

05:33.534 --> 05:36.268
It's the thought
that counts.
Ohh.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.536
Sorry.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.940
All right, bye-bye.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.675
Oh, that is too bad.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.711
I think Boyd would've really
had fun with that.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.714
Yeah, real fun.
A doll that sits and judges you.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.949
Oh, hey, mom, dad,

05:50.951 --> 05:53.685
I've been thinking a
lot about Christmas,
and I have a great idea.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.355
Oh. Yay! Finally, somebody
with the holiday spirit.

05:56.357 --> 06:00.459
Yep. So, this year instead
of presents, I just want cash.

06:00.461 --> 06:04.196
Somewhere
an angel lost its wings.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.731
Hear me out, okay?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.033
Every year, you guys get me
stuff that I don't really like

06:08.035 --> 06:09.801
And I return it
for cash anyways, right?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.803
You feel bad, I feel bad.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.539
[ inhales sharply ]
jobs are lost somehow.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.974
You know?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.576
We're not just
giving you cash.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.011
Okay, plan "b" --
uh, nobody buys me any presents,

06:20.013 --> 06:22.013
And I don't buy any
for anybody else.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.582
I think somebody just found
that angel's wings

06:23.584 --> 06:25.317
And beat it to death
with them.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.554
You guys get to keep your money,
I keep mine,

06:29.556 --> 06:32.657
And then we all just buy
what we want for ourselves.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.760
That's a great tax policy, but
it doesn't work for Christmas.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.194
Mandy,
y-you're old enough now,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.996
I'm not gonna
force Christmas spirit on you.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.031
But I hope that
one day you figure out

06:40.033 --> 06:42.000
Christmas is not about
the stuff you get.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.835
It's about
making other people happy.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.438
Like you've just done for me.
Thank you so much, mom!

06:46.440 --> 06:47.506
Merry Christmas!

06:55.581 --> 06:58.049
Okay, mija, you sit here
and work on your Christmas card.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.252
I got to get
some laundry started.

07:03.122 --> 07:06.591
Oh, h-hello.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.859
Hi, little girl.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.195
Are you lost,

07:10.197 --> 07:13.098
Or is this the most adorable
home invasion ever?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.733
[ laughing ]
oh, my god.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.034
I'm maria.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.636
You must be Mandy.
Yeah.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.906
My aunt Blanca always says
how beautiful you are.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.407
Oh, thank you.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.942
On the outside.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.080
Thank you!

07:29.082 --> 07:31.616
That's such a pretty dress.
I know, right?

07:31.618 --> 07:32.951
Ooh,
my parents got it for me

07:32.953 --> 07:34.719
For my great aunt edna's
funeral,

07:34.721 --> 07:37.756
But I faked a cold
so I didn't have to go. Shh!

07:37.758 --> 07:39.925
Everybody thought aunt edna
was faking a cold, too,

07:39.927 --> 07:42.994
But it turns out
she wasn't.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.497
But I got
a new dress out of it.

07:45.499 --> 07:49.000
So, you know, circle of life.
[ laughs ]

07:49.002 --> 07:52.270
Oh, hey, miss Mandy.
You met my niece.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.340
I had to pick her up from school
because my sister was working.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.276
Mandy, check out the Christmas
card I'm making for my father.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.745
Maria's father is away
fighting for his country.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.314
Oh. Who is mexico
at war with?

08:04.584 --> 08:07.352
No.
Oscar's American like me.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.621
He's in afghanistan.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.523
You know, this is
the second year in a row

08:11.525 --> 08:13.358
That he won't be home
for Christmas.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.794
It's a big sacrifice,
but...

08:15.796 --> 08:18.163
They're out there 24/7,
keeping our country safe.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.099
This is me...
Oh.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.868
...And my brother...
Mm-hmm.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.002
...And my mother.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.172
And here's my father
in afghanistan.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.507
That's rain, right?

08:28.509 --> 08:30.075
No. Those are bullets.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.047
All right.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.451
Hey, Boyd,
get down here!

08:39.453 --> 08:41.019
Now it's time to play
a little skit called

08:41.021 --> 08:44.222
"elf messes with dwarf."

08:46.192 --> 08:48.960
Hey, Boyd.
Clean up this mess.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.161
I'm still playing
with it.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.464
You're still playing with
that piece of carrot

08:52.466 --> 08:55.066
And that one shoe?
Kind of.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.702
All right, fine,
it's your funeral,

08:57.704 --> 09:00.138
But I'd be a little
worried about misbehaving
in front of elfie there.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.307
My dad says
he's just a toy.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.808
Maybe, maybe not.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.379
But what I'm asking is,
is, do you feel lucky?

09:07.381 --> 09:11.583
Well, do ya...Punk?

09:15.054 --> 09:17.422
<i>Pbht!</i>
<i>[ chuckles ]</i>

09:20.192 --> 09:23.895
Oh, man. I'm so playing this
at his wedding.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.033
Hey, Boyd.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.602
Just got an interesting text
from Santa here.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.872
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was him.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.441
A lot of typos,
like a fat guy wearing mittens.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.744
Uh, he said
you made faces at the elf

09:39.746 --> 09:41.079
And shook your butt
at him.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.616
Elfie saw me?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.217
And he went
straight to the big guy.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.054
I'm sorry.
I'll clean all this up.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.122
Yeah, well, hey,
and when you're done here,

09:51.124 --> 09:52.424
If you want to
score extra points with elfie,

09:52.426 --> 09:54.192
You know, you --
I'll let you clean my room.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.994
Thanks, aunt Eve.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.466
Hey, mom, do you need
any chores done?

10:01.468 --> 10:03.435
Hey. I like it.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.204
At least somebody's
sucking up for the holidays.
[ chuckles ]

10:06.206 --> 10:08.406
No, I've got myself
a little helper monkey.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.474
Check it out.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.213
What are you guys
looking at?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.482
Oh, I hid a trail camera
in the Christmas tree

10:17.484 --> 10:19.084
So that Boyd would think
the elf was watching him.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.719
Look.
Cool.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.120
You know, you're playing
a mean trick on your nephew

10:22.122 --> 10:23.288
And I don't like it.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.190
And a great trick on his dad.
I love it.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.128
We can pump with this kid
with so much Christmas spirit,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.497
He'll be farting candy canes
at his dad's house.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.934
Wait a minute.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.737
Did you use
my xt-41 camera?
Mm-hmm.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.939
That's a great image,
isn't it?

10:40.941 --> 10:42.807
Look at that.
Yeah.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.243
Please tell me you don't
have other cameras hidden
all over the house.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.578
Yeah,
that's what I do at work.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.113
I watch you
chop vegetables all day.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.015
Mike, I-I have a job.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.182
[ <i>door closes</i> ]

10:56.022 --> 10:57.455
Oh, my god.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.025
Those candy canes he's eating
are 10 years old.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.862
We should get down there before
he starts in on the tinsel.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.463
[ chuckles ]
wait.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.698
What is he looking at now?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.967
Uh-oh.
We've been compromised.

11:08.969 --> 11:13.538
Call the president.
Fire up a couple of drones.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.343
Surveillance?
Seriously, Mike?

11:18.345 --> 11:21.546
This is what holidays
must have been like at
the nixon white house.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.781
You leave nixon alone.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.983
He opened up china for
the rest of the world.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.052
Without that,
there'd be no toys for anyone.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.689
Don't blame Mike.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.223
Eve put the camera
there to fool Boyd.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.125
Well, give me some credit.
It <i>is</i> my camera.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.063
Hey, buddy.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.998
I finished
cleaning up Eve's room.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.668
Now I'm gonna clean up
muffin's poop in the yard.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.036
Honey,
use the pooper-scooper.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.872
I'll use
both my pooper-scoopers.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.475
Wait. Why are you
doing all these chores?

11:50.477 --> 11:52.143
I'm just being
a really good boy.

11:52.145 --> 11:56.347
The kind who deserves
his very own bounce house.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.049
Okay, Boyd,
stop talking to the toy, okay?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.484
Elfie's not a toy.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.686
He's real.
He sees everything.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.089
You know what goes good
with a bounce house?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.256
Robots.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.393
You know what? I can't
let this go on any longer.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.028
Y-yeah, you want to tell him
the truth, don't you?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.696
Tell him the truth
that robots and bouncy houses

12:11.698 --> 12:13.098
Are natural enemies.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.234
Boyd, the elf
can't really see you, okay?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.702
Aunt Eve
was playing a trick on you.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.071
She hid a camera right here
in the Christmas tree.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.073
Do you see that?
Oh.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.044
I liked it more
when the elf was real.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.212
Of course, you did.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.847
Uh, honey,
you know, come on.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.215
I-I'll get you
a holiday cookie.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.750
I don't like those.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.985
No, the good ones.
Not the kind your dad makes.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.122
Let me
ask you a question.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.124
What was the problem letting
the kid think that elf was real?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.759
I don't like lying
to Boyd.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.260
It's not lying.
It's a fantasy.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.129
It's like if you like
your health plan,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.364
You can keep it, period.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.399
It <i>is</i> a lie, okay?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.935
A-a magical little elf
who talks to Santa

12:50.937 --> 12:52.971
Who's gonna bring him
everything he's ever dreamed of?
Right.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.240
I mean, how is he supposed
to trust me when he finds
out that it's not real?

12:55.242 --> 12:59.110
It's a harmless kids' toy.
No, it builds
unrealistic expectations.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.379
You've got it real nice, Mike,
but for a lot of people,

13:01.381 --> 13:03.815
Christmas doesn't look
like it does on a tv commercial.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.650
You had Christmas,
even in canada.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.819
Santa Claus
could walk there.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.723
My parents didn't buy into
the whole Christmas thing.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.925
You know, if we were lucky,
my dad would come home

13:13.927 --> 13:15.960
With something that he
picked up last minute
at the gas station.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.097
So we got pens
and bubble gum and batteries.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.266
So he got it backwards --

13:21.268 --> 13:23.134
Remembered the batteries.
Forgot the present.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.436
We tried to be all excited
and happy,

13:25.438 --> 13:26.971
But they weren't wrapped

13:26.973 --> 13:28.740
And they didn't even
have our names on them.

13:28.742 --> 13:29.974
So you didn't have
a good Christmas,

13:29.976 --> 13:31.509
And you're taking it out
on the kid?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.945
No, I'm just gonna
be honest with him, all right?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.914
He's gonna get plenty
of presents from the
people who love him,

13:35.916 --> 13:37.081
But he's not gonna
wait around,

13:37.083 --> 13:39.951
Waiting for magic
that's never gonna happen.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.120
Come on, Boyd.
Let's go.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.923
[ sighs ]

13:49.094 --> 13:52.764
I have been a very good boy.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.866
I listened.

13:54.868 --> 13:59.137
So how about...
One of those panini presses?

14:07.513 --> 14:10.048
Here you go. Thank you.
Okay, next kid.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.482
Yes, mr. Alzate.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.885
Next up is, uh,
billy and jeffery osgood.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.486
Their dad works
in the purchasing department.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.989
Oh, yes, of course --
larry osgood.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.724
He's the one
who stuck me

14:19.726 --> 14:21.993
With a truckload
of novelty t-shirts.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.962
I got a Christmas present
for him.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.797
I won't fire him
until the first.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.967
The beard isn't soundproof,
mr. Alzate.
Okay.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.036
Here you are.
Okay, here you go, kid.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.504
All right.
[ clears throat ]

14:33.506 --> 14:35.807
"fishermen do it
with a pole."

14:37.376 --> 14:39.644
And for you, uh...

14:39.646 --> 14:43.047
"I don't need a pill
to pitch a tent."

14:43.049 --> 14:45.149
Don't wear them
to church.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.718
Ho, ho, ho.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.554
Oh, hey, Mandy.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.589
Oh, it's a Christmas party.
You sure you want to be here?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.858
There's only five days left in
the shop-for-yourself season.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.226
Shouldn't you
be at the mall?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.995
Did you guys ever
stop to think that maybe

14:56.997 --> 14:58.363
Instead of
buying things for myself

14:58.365 --> 15:00.331
I'm buying a really nice gift
for somebody else?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.833
No.
No.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.701
So I just --
I guess it's too much

15:03.703 --> 15:05.670
To expect for you guys
to ever just trust me?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.171
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.041
Mm. Hey, Mandy, thanks
for your Christmas present.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.409
Oh, I didn't
get you anything.
Sure you did.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.645
Mom and dad hating you
is all I asked for this year.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.448
Kristin: Hey, guys.
Merry Christmas.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.950
Hey.
Hey.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.019
Merry Christmas, Boyd.
Merry Christmas, dad.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.087
And mer-- happy --
you know...

15:23.089 --> 15:25.089
How's your December
treatin' ya?

15:27.059 --> 15:29.027
Honey, you want to
go say hi to Santa?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.396
Not really.
Oh, sure you do,
sweetie.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.031
Look, if he doesn't want
to say hi to Santa,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.465
He doesn't have to
say hi to Santa.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.801
Perfect opportunity.
Santa's like three
nogs into the wind.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.270
If you're good, he'll give you
anything you ask for.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.073
If you're naughty,
you'll have to talk about jazz.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.275
Oh, hey, guys. Yay!

15:44.277 --> 15:45.643
So glad you guys
could make it.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.446
Oh, thank you for
inviting us, miss Mandy.
Hi.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.981
This is my sister inez...
Hi, inez.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.450
...And her children
and their cousins.
Hi, there.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.386
Mandy,
you look so beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.988
Is it me,
or is it the outfit?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.923
Well, the outfit
makes you more beautiful,

15:58.925 --> 16:00.658
But    <i>y</i>make the outfit
more beautiful.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.593
Oh, my god!

16:02.595 --> 16:05.730
You are the little sister
I've always wanted!

16:05.732 --> 16:07.966
Hey, I heard that.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.101
I know, 'cause
I said it right at you.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.003
Hey, you know what?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.138
I think Santa has a very special
present for you guys.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.139
Blanca: Ooh!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.275
Uh, Kyle, they're here.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.010
You know, when I was
a little girl,

16:19.012 --> 16:21.679
Santa once
brought me a lump of coal.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.982
Best Christmas ever.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.085
The house was warm
for over an hour.

16:27.087 --> 16:30.355
Look, Santa.
It's the hernandez family.
Who?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.523
Oh, oh. I only have
three t-shirts left.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.492
We've been expecting you.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.495
I-I-I think your gift
is right over here in this box.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.930
What are you doing,
Kyle? Th-that's --
that's a decoration.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.199
Mandy: Go ahead.
You can open it.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.868
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Daddy's home.
Oh, my god.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.705
[ applause ]

16:49.775 --> 16:51.042
Ed:
What the hell's going on?

16:58.951 --> 17:00.985
[ applause continues ]
how are you guys doing?

17:00.987 --> 17:03.021
Hey,
who -- who is he?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.656
Uh, that's their dad.
It's Blanca's brother-in-law.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.492
I thought --
I thought he was in afghanistan.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.660
Well, I guess Santa
gave him a ride on his sleigh.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.796
And Santa's little helper.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.865
Oh, mr. Baxter,
I-I don't know how you did this,

17:13.867 --> 17:16.734
But this is the most wonderful
Christmas present ever!

17:16.736 --> 17:19.537
I-I didn't do this.
Mandy did.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.374
[ sighs ] then it truly is
a Christmas miracle.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.308
[ laughs ]

17:28.147 --> 17:30.148
This is better than
the coal Christmas!

17:30.150 --> 17:31.682
[ laughs ]

17:31.684 --> 17:35.053
Wow. So, instead of
buying yourself presents,

17:35.055 --> 17:38.022
You flew a sailor home
from afghanistan?
Mm-hmm.

17:38.024 --> 17:41.092
Wow. That's so
kind and unselfish.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.094
You're like the big sister
I always wanted.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.530
What? I heard that.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.165
That's 'cause
I said it right at you.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.768
Well, I'm just glad
I found the right sailor.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.670
There are like a thousand
guys in the service

17:52.672 --> 17:54.005
Named hernandez.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.041
Why didn't you tell us
what you were up to?
Yeah.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.077
'cause I wanted it
to be from me.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.112
Yeah, but --
and knowing dad,
he would have taken over

18:01.114 --> 18:02.613
And paid for
the whole thing.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.782
I'm a great guy
that way.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.285
I'm a greater guy
for raising someone like you.
Thanks.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.121
Well, it was worth it
just to see the looks
on those kids' faces

18:10.123 --> 18:11.856
When their dad
came out of the box.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.357
Good thing there's
plenty of air in that box,

18:13.359 --> 18:16.027
Or there'd have been
a very different look.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.131
Still don't believe in
Christmas magic?
[ scoffs ]

18:20.133 --> 18:22.433
See, everybody should be
with their family, even you.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.735
Yeah, I told you, Mike.
Mine's not so into Christmas.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.037
I mean <i>this</i> family.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.538
Spend all the time
you want Christmas morning.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.440
And when you're ready,
come on over to our house.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.642
May even be
a package or two there.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.277
Even one for you.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.579
I don't want to spoil
the surprise,

18:34.581 --> 18:36.848
But it's
probably batteries.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.719
Hi, sweetie.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.292
Hey, Boyd, remember,

18:48.294 --> 18:51.095
We said we'd wait for the whole
family to be awake and --

18:51.097 --> 18:54.265
Eh, screw it.
Ah, look at him
tear into that thing.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.235
Just like his dad
at a vegan buffet.

18:58.237 --> 19:01.072
Want to see
some Christmas magic?

19:01.074 --> 19:03.107
[ sighs ] it's 6:00
in the morning, honey.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.110
Not that. But I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.012
Look.
What?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.514
The kids are opening
their gifts already.

19:09.516 --> 19:13.017
Oh, Boyd's here?
Why didn't you say so?

19:13.019 --> 19:15.019
Come on.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.189
Cool!

19:18.191 --> 19:20.958
Peyton manning jersey.
Thanks, elfie.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.493
Yeah, thanks, elfie.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.997
Elfie told me he had
to wait in a line
three hours to get that.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.466
He must've told Santa
it was what you wanted.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.669
Yeah, or maybe it was
the work of la befana,

19:31.671 --> 19:34.172
The italian Christmas
witch who flies from
village to village

19:34.174 --> 19:35.940
Delivering gifts
on her broom.

19:37.809 --> 19:41.045
Yeah, you're right.
It's probably elfie and Santa.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.713
Girls, come on down.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.682
I want to get a picture
in front of the Christmas tree.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.050
Yeah, please,
let's immortalize

19:46.052 --> 19:48.019
How I look at 6:00 a.M.
Without any makeup.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.588
[ chuckles ]
I don't need makeup. I'm young.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.560
Merry Christmas, Mike.
Merry Christmas.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.894
All right, guys,
let's gather around.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.996
Let's get a shot here,
all of us together.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.331
Kristin:
Who's taking the --
stare at the tree.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.832
Who's taking --
and, uh, smile at --
at elfie, all right?

20:01.834 --> 20:02.900
Yeah? Okay.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.735
And we got to say that cookie.
What is it called?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.671
Uh, pepparkakor, Mike.
Everybody, on 3,
say "pepparkakor."

20:06.673 --> 20:07.972
1, 2, 3.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.074
All: Pepparkakor!

20:19.985 --> 20:21.919
Excuse me.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.421
I'm collecting
for disabled veterans

20:23.423 --> 20:24.822
Who have been injured
in battle.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.157
Not today, thanks.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.391
Oh, n-no problem.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.994
Hey, I see you're shopping
for a pair of gloves.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.963
Must be nice
to still have two hands.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.867
Thank you.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.836
Enjoy being able to clap.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.406
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.874
Ah, Christmas.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.377
It's the time of year
when we embrace traditions,

20:46.379 --> 20:50.114
Like the outdoor man
tree of trout.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.050
Then we get yelled at by people
who embrace other traditions.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.952
"a tree of trout?
That stinks."

20:54.954 --> 20:57.054
Yeah, wait three days.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.023
Arguing about
our different traditions

20:59.025 --> 21:01.859
Is actually
a great American tradition.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.294
And you know
who makes it possible

21:03.296 --> 21:05.963
For you to enjoy Christmas and
for others to wage war on it?

21:05.965 --> 21:08.132
The folks who wage actual war,

21:08.134 --> 21:09.867
Putting their lives on the line
every day

21:09.869 --> 21:11.035
To protect our freedom to bicker

21:11.037 --> 21:13.437
Over whose holiday is better,
yours or mine.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.907
Spoiler alert -- it's mine.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.609
Which is why I'm honored
to tell you about

21:18.611 --> 21:20.411
Outdoor man's
annual Christmas tradition --

21:20.413 --> 21:22.647
Raising money
for our wounded warriors.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.215
This Christmas season, dig deep,

21:24.217 --> 21:25.950
Give a little something
to the men and women

21:25.952 --> 21:28.085
Who have given more
than we can ever repay.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.553
Thank you, all.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.622
And merry Christmas.
