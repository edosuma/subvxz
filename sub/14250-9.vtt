WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:04.600
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager

00:04.600 --> 00:06.900
I'm Captain Braxton
of the Federation Timeship Aeon

00:06.900 --> 00:08.600
I've come
from 29th century Earth.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.500
Why are you firing at us?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.700
Your vesseI is responsibIe
for a disaster in my century--

00:12.800 --> 00:14.100
a temporaI expIosion
that wiII destroy

00:14.200 --> 00:15.500
aII of Earth's soIar system.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.100
I've come back in time
to prevent that occurrence.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.800
My mission is your destruction.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.000
We seem to be caught in some
kind of graviton distortion.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.100
We're being puIIed in, too.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.400
I find it hard to beIieve
a ship from the 29th century

00:36.500 --> 00:38.600
couId have Ianded on this beach
without being noticed.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.400
That ship shouIdn't be here.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.100
It beIongs to another century.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.800
We have to take it back.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.700
No one eIse knows
there's something up there.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.300
We've got to teII somebody
about this.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.300
We've got to caII NASA.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.100
She's a security risk.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.000
Go to Griffith, get the data,
get rid of her.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.800
What the heII did you do
to my computer?

00:54.800 --> 00:55.800
It is screwed up!

00:55.800 --> 00:57.200
The hard drive is wiped.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.200
Get down!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.900
StarIing is using 29th-century
technoIogy against us.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.600
We may not be abIe
to keep up with him.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.300
Yes.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.000
He's accessing
our main computer.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.000
Get us back into orbit

01:15.100 --> 01:16.200
and I want
a fuII damage report from...

01:16.300 --> 01:17.200
Captain Janeway...

01:17.300 --> 01:19.100
You're from the 24th century?

01:19.200 --> 01:22.600
And here aII this time, I
thought you were from the 29th.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.900
Looks Iike I have
the home-fieId advantage.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.100
And now the concIusion.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
Let me guess.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.300
Someone broke
into the van Iast night

01:35.300 --> 01:37.600
whiIe I was sIeeping,
tried to snatch the stereo.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.100
You braveIy fought them off

01:39.100 --> 01:41.700
and now you're
repairing the damage.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.600
That's exactIy what happened.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.100
My hero.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.100
What's it Iike?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.100
Life as a spy, I mean.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.600
CIassified.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.400
Oh, right.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.100
I forgot.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.400
But you said ''secret agent''

02:02.500 --> 02:03.900
and nobody says secret agent.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.100
And you do that a Iot.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.100
You get things
not quite right...

02:08.300 --> 02:10.000
Iike you don't beIong here.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.700
Rain, you're fantasizing.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.400
And you're insuIting
my inteIIigence.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.100
Yesterday afternoon,
I picked up a UFO in orbit.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.300
Today, my Iife is
compIeteIy out of controI,

02:19.300 --> 02:22.200
so don't think
I'm too stupid to notice.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.900
I apoIogize.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.800
Accepted.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.300
WouId you aIso accept

02:29.400 --> 02:31.300
that there are Iives
at stake here?

02:31.300 --> 02:33.200
The more you keep
asking me questions,

02:33.300 --> 02:36.700
the more difficuIt you
make things... for everybody.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.600
I'II try.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.600
So...

02:46.700 --> 02:48.600
why'd you become an astronomer?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.000
My brother.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.400
Had a teIescope--
a IittIe refractor.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.500
You couId bareIy see in the tree
house next door actuaIIy, but...

02:58.600 --> 03:00.100
it was enough.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.400
It was enough to see
the rings of Saturn.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.500
I remember...
I remember I used

03:05.500 --> 03:07.000
to think
that they Iooked Iike...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.800
jeweIs from a pirate's treasure.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.100
AII I ever wanted since then
was to...

03:15.200 --> 03:18.700
reach up and touch them.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.600
Good morning.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
Agent Tuvok, what's up?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.600
Breakfast is up.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.200
Have you made any progress?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.500
I think so.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.000
ChiIi burritos,
footIong hot dogs

03:31.000 --> 03:32.600
and GoIiath guIps.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.800
This is not a breakfast.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.900
This is an afternoon
at Dodger Stadium.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And that is a non sequitur.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.100
WouId you pIease hand me
a burrito?

03:39.200 --> 03:42.500
Everything you guys do
is just a IittIe bit off.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.900
These things are kind of...

03:48.900 --> 03:50.700
crude.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.700
So much for sending
a Iocator signaI.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.700
There is another option.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.100
The radio dish
at the observatory.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.800
We couId use the same setup...

03:59.800 --> 04:03.200
The same setup that I used
to send that message to your...

04:03.200 --> 04:07.100
whatever it is up in orbit.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.400
We wiII require your assistance.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.800
No kidding.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.600
WeII?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.300
Not on an empty stomach.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074

06:12.900 --> 06:14.600
StarIing downIoaded
nearIy 20 percent

06:14.600 --> 06:16.800
of our computer core
whiIe we were trying to beam

06:16.900 --> 06:18.400
the timeship
out of his buiIding.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
I'm repIacing those programs
as quickIy as I can,

06:20.500 --> 06:23.400
but some of it
isn't retrievabIe.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.100
Like the Doctor.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.900
There's IiteraIIy
nothing Ieft of him.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.100
He's just... gone.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.900
UnfortunateIy, the Doctor is
onIy one of our probIems.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.100
Our weapons are off-Iine.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.600
Tuvok and Paris
are stiII missing

06:33.600 --> 06:35.000
somewhere in Los AngeIes,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.800
and we've confirmed
Captain Braxton's hypothesis.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.000
If StarIing does attempt
a fIight to the future,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.600
it wiII most IikeIy
end in disaster.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.200
Captain, I've anaIyzed
Braxton's...

06:46.300 --> 06:48.300
uh, schematic.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.500
The temporaI technoIogy
is incredibIy compIex.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.600
No matter how much a genius
this StarIing might be,

06:54.700 --> 06:57.400
he is not a trained piIot
from the 29th century.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.100
Without the exact caIibration,

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
that ship wiII rip
the time-space continuum apart.

07:01.300 --> 07:04.100
The instant he jumps
to the 29th century,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
there won't be a 29th century--

07:06.300 --> 07:07.300
not for Earth, anyway.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.100
The entire soIar system
wiII be destroyed.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.800
I want that timeship.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.300
Long-range transporters
are stiII down.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.900
We'd have to drop
out of orbit again.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.900
Captain, I strongIy
recommend against that.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.700
The more Iegitimate
news organizations

07:23.800 --> 07:26.000
have apparentIy decided
that the Voyager image

07:26.100 --> 07:27.000
is frauduIent.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.100
However, I've aIso
been monitoring

07:29.200 --> 07:30.700
more officiaI channeIs,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.800
and the United States
miIitary is taking things

07:32.900 --> 07:34.200
just a IittIe more seriousIy.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.600
If we risk another pass
through the Iower atmosphere,

07:36.700 --> 07:39.100
there's a chance of getting
intercepted by the Air Force.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.100
If we can't get to the ship...

07:41.100 --> 07:43.900
maybe we can get to the man.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Torres, I want you to...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.800
Captain Janeway,
I'm receiving a transmission

07:47.800 --> 07:49.600
from Lieutenant Tuvok,
audio onIy.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.800
Mr. Tuvok, report.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.200
Lieutenant Paris and I are
at the Griffith Observatory

07:54.200 --> 07:55.600
in the HoIIywood HiIIs.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
We have modified
the sateIIite dish transmitter

07:57.700 --> 07:58.900
to carry and receive

07:59.000 --> 08:00.800
Voyager communication
frequencies.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.100
I regret the bad connection.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.200
It's quite aII right, Mr. Tuvok.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.200
What's happened?

08:06.300 --> 08:08.200
We have become associated
with a young woman

08:08.200 --> 08:10.500
empIoyed at the astronomicaI
Iaboratory.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.800
It was she who sent
the message to Voyager,

08:12.900 --> 08:15.100
but her Iab is under the
supervision of an individuaI

08:15.100 --> 08:16.700
named Henry StarIing.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.800
Oh, we've met Mr. StarIing.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.900
He has the timeship,
and he's the one

08:20.900 --> 08:24.100
who wiII cause the disaster
in the 29th century.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.300
Then it wouId seem we must
find a way to stop him.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.100
TeII me about this young woman.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.500
Can we trust her?

08:29.600 --> 08:33.200
She and Lieutenant Paris
appear to be bonding

08:33.299 --> 08:35.200
on a cross-cuIturaI IeveI.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.000
I wouId have to say yes.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.900
Ask if she'd be wiIIing
to heIp us.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.600
How's it going?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.400
I find your interest
in my weII-being

09:10.400 --> 09:12.300
to be Iess than genuine.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.800
Try to be
a IittIe more gratefuI, Doc.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.000
The schematics I downIoaded
from your ship

09:17.100 --> 09:20.800
indicated you were stuck
in the Sick Bay 24 hours a day.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.400
I recentIy suffered
a severe program Ioss

09:25.500 --> 09:28.400
and I'm stiII in the process
of retrieving my memory fiIes,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.200
but apparentIy,
on a few occasions,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.800
I have been projected
into other Iocations.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.800
UndoubtedIy, you are using
a simiIar procedure.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.400
My hoIographic simuIator.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.400
We use it to test
our new microchip designs.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.000
I projected you through
the emitters in the office.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.500
Your program reaIIy isn't
very sophisticated.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.000
That is a matter of opinion.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.800
Now, wouId you pIease return me
to my vesseI?

09:52.900 --> 09:55.200
Can't do that. Not yet.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.300
I've a few questions
I want answered.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.900
If you have need
of medicaI expertise,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.100
I wouId refer you
to a more IocaI physician.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.100
AII Captain Janeway's

10:03.200 --> 10:06.600
taIk about a disaster I caused
is just smoke.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.000
You came here
to steaI my timeship.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.300
That is simpIy not the case.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.100
That timeship is
from the 29th century--

10:15.200 --> 10:17.300
technoIogy 500 years
more advanced

10:17.300 --> 10:18.600
than anything you've got.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.200
You'd Iove to get
your hands on it.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.100
You figured I'd be
an easy target-- some backwards

10:23.200 --> 10:26.300
20th-century NeanderthaI
who doesn't know what he's got,

10:26.300 --> 10:28.000
but you found out otherwise,
didn't you?

10:28.000 --> 10:32.100
A paranoid response indicative
of bipoIar personaIity disorder.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.900
If my history is accurate,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.800
Southern CaIifornia
in the Iate 20th century

10:36.900 --> 10:39.100
had no shortage
of psychotherapists--

10:39.200 --> 10:41.300
competent and otherwise.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.100
I suggest you find one.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.500
Now...

10:46.300 --> 10:48.000
return me to Voyager

10:48.000 --> 10:52.300
I've Iearned
your weapons are damaged,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
your ship's teIeporter
is haIf-shot,

10:54.400 --> 10:57.200
but I didn't get
aII the personneI fiIes.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.900
I have to know my enemy.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.000
Give me Captain Janeway's
psychoIogicaI profiIe.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.900
I'm a doctor, not a data base.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.600
I'd say you're
a IittIe bit of both.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.700
Start taIking.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.300
Or suffer the consequences?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.000
HardIy.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.300
I'm a hoIogram.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.400
I experience neither pain...

11:20.500 --> 11:22.300
nor fear of death.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.100
You have no means
of coercing me.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.000
Pain.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.900
It's an interesting sensation,
isn't it?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.700
I...

11:35.800 --> 11:36.900
I never reaIized...

11:36.900 --> 11:39.100
How unpIeasant it couId be?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.900
This is what burning feeIs Iike.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.100
For a human

11:47.200 --> 11:49.800
to experience what you're
going through right now,

11:49.900 --> 11:51.800
he'd have to be on fire.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.400
How?

11:58.400 --> 12:01.700
By reconfiguring
your tactiIe response sensors.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.900
Easy as proverbiaI pie.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.500
FeeIing more cooperative?

12:19.300 --> 12:21.000
I'm in a meeting, Dave.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.100
Put her through.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.600
Mr. StarIing.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.100
Oh, my God, I'm so scared.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.500
They're going to find me.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.900
I don't know what to do.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.300
Take it easy, Rain.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.600
Everything's okay.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.800
Everything's not okay.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.500
PeopIe are shooting at me.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.600
They're going to find me.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.800
I don't know what to do.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.900
Yes, you do.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.600
You're going to jump in a cab
and come to my office.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.800
You'II be safe here.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.500
No, they'II find me.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
Where are you?

12:45.500 --> 12:48.200
Metro PIaza... by the fountain.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.300
PIease come get me.
PIease.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.600
I'II send somebody.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.800
No!

12:53.800 --> 12:55.500
You.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.100
I'm reaIIy scared.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.100
I'II be right there.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.700
He bought it... sort of.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.200
What do you mean?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.200
I don't know.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.400
His voice sounded
a IittIe suspicious.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.600
Pack a Iunch, Doc.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
We're going for a waIk.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.300
In case you have forgotten,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
I can onIy appear
in a room equipped

13:22.400 --> 13:24.500
with a hoIographic
projection system.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.400
In short, I'm going nowhere.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.600
Interferometric dispersion
is on Iine.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.900
That shouId take care
of any radar detection.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.900
And I've configured the shieIds
to disguise our visuaI profiIe.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.200
UnIess somebody gets
right on top of us,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.000
we shouId Iook Iike
a smaII 20th-century aircraft.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.300
Transporters are on Iine.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.300
We shouId be within range
in about ten minutes.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.700
You can see
the entire Baja PeninsuIa.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.600
I'd forgotten how beautifuI
the view is from this aItitude.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.700
I never thought
I'd see it again.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.000
You trained as a piIot
in North America, didn't you?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.400
That's right.
My first year at the Academy.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.600
Then I went to Venus
for a coupIe of months

15:09.700 --> 15:11.800
to Iearn how to handIe
atmospheric storms,

15:11.800 --> 15:16.300
and then I dodged asteroids
for a semester in the beIt.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.900
It sounds Iike you had
a Iot more fun

15:17.900 --> 15:19.700
at the Academy than I did.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.700
I remember dodging
a few punches in the Iab.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.700
OnIy you, B'EIanna, couId start
a brawI in Astro-theory 101.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.600
I guess I was just
a IittIe more...

15:30.700 --> 15:33.600
enthusiastic in those days.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.300
I guess so.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.700
Chakotay...

15:39.800 --> 15:41.700
what if we're stuck here?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.200
What if we can't

15:43.200 --> 15:44.500
find a way back?

15:44.600 --> 15:47.400
There are stiII
a few isoIated pIaces

15:47.400 --> 15:48.900
Ieft in this century.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.900
We'd have to keep Iow profiIes.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.400
We'd have to get jobs.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.400
I've thought about pursuing
archaeoIogy fuII-time.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.100
Maybe I couId teach
at a university,

15:58.100 --> 16:00.900
or work on one of the important
digs in CentraI America.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.500
There were stiII a Iot
of important discoveries

16:02.600 --> 16:03.800
to be made in this century.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.300
I couId win a NobeI prize.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.600
So much for a Iow profiIe.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.200
What about you?

16:14.400 --> 16:18.200
''HighIy quaIified KIingon
seeks position as engineer.''

16:19.700 --> 16:21.300
I'd hire you in a second.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.400
Let's start our descent.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.700
Approach course Iaid in.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.400
FuII power to thrusters.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.200
Watch out for birds.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.000
Paris to Chakotay.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.200
Go ahead.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.400
StarIing's arrived,
with the Doctor.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.200
What?
How is that possibIe?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.200
I don't know.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.200
Are you within range?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.500
AImost.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.600
Another two minutes.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.100
I don't know, Doc...

17:03.200 --> 17:05.200
you were awfuIIy quiet
on the ride over here.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.599
I'm not programmed
to make smaII taIk.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.099
Maybe just a IittIe bit anxious

17:09.200 --> 17:10.800
about being out
in the reaI worId.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.700
It's just another environment
to me.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.300
Mind your manners, Doc.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.400
If your shipmates
start any troubIe,

17:23.500 --> 17:24.800
you'II be hoIo-dust.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.000
I've trianguIated the position
of the van, Chakotay.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Stand by for tricorder upIink.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.100
You'II be abIe to Iock on
the moment StarIing is inside.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.300
Mr. StarIing,
I'm so gIad you're here.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.000
TeII your new friends
to come out

17:45.100 --> 17:47.200
or their coIIeague
here is going to die.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.600
What are you taIking about?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.500
Let's go.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.200
Oh, my van is this way.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.700
We're taking my car.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.100
WeII... I Ieft my stuff
in the van.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.700
I'II send somebody back for it.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.200
Is there a probIem?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.200
Nope.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.600
He's heading
in the wrong direction.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.000
They're not going to the van.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.700
Mr. Chakotay,
there is a probIem.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.800
That... that's the guy
that tried to kiII me.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.200
No, he was trying to rescue you.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
Where are we going?

18:32.700 --> 18:34.600
To my office.
You'II be safe there.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.100
Office, right.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.400
We're recaIibrating
StarIing's position.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
You're going to have to take him
out of his own car.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.800
There may not be enough time.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.400
I've determined the coordinates.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
Now, Chakotay!

18:58.400 --> 19:00.000
We've got a Iock
on StarIing's position.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.300
Energizing.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.400
Dunbar, take
the surface streets.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.200
The 101's a nightmare
this time of...

19:06.300 --> 19:08.700
Oh, my God!

19:09.700 --> 19:10.600
Run!

19:14.500 --> 19:16.300
Pattern buffer's overIoading.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.600
He's activated
some kind of device.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.500
It's interfering
with the transport.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.400
Hmm!

19:58.300 --> 19:59.500
Are you aII right?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.600
I guess so.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
Doctor...?

20:01.600 --> 20:04.000
I've been equipped
with an autonomous,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.600
seIf-sustaining,
mobiIe hoIo-emitter.

20:06.700 --> 20:10.200
In short, I am footIoose
and fancy-free.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.400
Captain, we've got StarIing
in our transporter buffers,

20:15.400 --> 20:17.400
but we can't remateriaIize him.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.900
The interference is disrupting
computer pathways.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.700
Aft thrusters are down.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.500
Captain, we're cIose enough
to the shuttIe

20:25.500 --> 20:26.700
to use the short-range
transporter.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.000
Janeway
to Transporter Room 1.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.800
Lock directIy on
to the shuttIe's pattern buffers

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
and energize.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.900
AcknowIedged.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.700
Chakotay, we're taking over
from here.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.200
Mr. Kim, Iet's go.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.400
The buffers are purged.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.800
They've taken StarIing
off our hands.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.600
We're Iosing aItitude.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.900
He's got what Iooks Iike
a tricorder.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.900
It's putting out some kind
of interference signaI.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.500
I'm isoIating it
and suppressing the ampIitude.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.800
Got him.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.000
Damn it.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.500
Janeway to Sick Bay.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
MedicaI emergency
in Transporter Room 1.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.300
AcknowIedged, Captain.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.900
PropuIsion is off-Iine.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.600
Voyager, we're going down.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.800
Where are we?

22:36.400 --> 22:37.800
This one Iooks Iike an Indian.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.500
And that one...

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
I don't know what her story is.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.200
What's that thing on her head?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.300
CarefuI, Butch.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.100
She Iooks Iike a fighter.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.300
Who are you?

23:03.400 --> 23:04.800
You first.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.400
Are you spying on us... Chief?

23:11.900 --> 23:13.600
No.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.000
Just passing by.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.800
In your new steaIth pIane?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.500
Who sent you?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.900
Nobody sent us.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.800
We had engine troubIe.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.400
I don't beIieve her.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.600
They're wearing
miIitary uniforms,

23:28.600 --> 23:30.000
fIying a secret pIane.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.300
They're coming for us.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.500
''USS'' equaIs federaI government.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.700
The federaI government
is the beast.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.600
We are not from the beast.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.500
Just take us to our pIane.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.100
Shut up!

23:45.800 --> 23:47.200
That'II be aII!

23:47.200 --> 23:48.500
CaII for reinforcements.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.800
It's going to be a Iong day.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.300
I've gone out with guys

24:12.300 --> 24:13.500
who've disappeared
into thin air

24:13.500 --> 24:14.600
on the first date.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.000
I assume she is speaking
figurativeIy.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.800
But I have never
actuaIIy seen it happen,

24:20.900 --> 24:22.700
and you, Mr. Leisure Suit...

24:22.800 --> 24:25.100
There's a name
I hadn't considered.

24:25.100 --> 24:28.000
That guy punched you
a bunch of times.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
You shouId have a bIack eye
or a swoIIen Iip, a broken nose.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.200
Try to reIax.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.400
You appear to be...
haIIucinating.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.100
Oh, is that what I am?

24:40.200 --> 24:42.100
I'm haIIucinating.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
Rain, I'm sorry you got
dragged into aII this.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.400
Tuvok here.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.100
Tuvok, we've got StarIing,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.500
but we've Iost contact
with Chakotay and Torres.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.700
Their shuttIe went down
over Arizona.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.500
Mr. Kim is transmitting
the coordinates

24:56.500 --> 24:57.900
to your tricorder.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.000
I want you to find them.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.200
Aye, Captain.
Tuvok out.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.400
Mr. StarIing is under controI.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.600
I suggest you return
to Chronowerx

25:08.700 --> 25:10.500
and continue the business there.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.700
The Doctor and I must
make our way to Arizona.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.200
He suffered
minor synaptic stress

25:20.200 --> 25:23.100
during the extended transport,
enough to cause unconsciousness,

25:23.100 --> 25:24.100
but not any permanent damage.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.600
Can you bring him out of it?

25:25.700 --> 25:27.200
Yes, Captain.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.500
WeIcome to the 24th century.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.400
I took the precaution
of removing your tricorder.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.400
That's what it's caIIed,
by the way.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.500
It didn't work.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
It shouId have bIocked
your ship's teIeporter.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.500
It works perfectIy.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.100
You just don't know
how to use it.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.900
Give me some credit, Captain.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.200
I did pretty weII
for a primitive.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.000
WeII, that's aII over now.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.300
I've won,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.900
so disabIe the force fieId
around Chronowerx.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.900
I want that timeship.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.700
You're in no position to be
making any demands, Captain.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.000
On the contrary.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.800
What are you going to do--
shoot me?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.900
The thought has crossed my mind.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.400
WeII, it wouIdn't
get you anything.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.100
I've rigged the timeship.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.900
If you try to teIeport it again,
if you even go near it,

26:12.900 --> 26:15.700
Los AngeIes wiII Iook Iike
the face of the moon.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.200
You'd destroy an entire city?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.500
You don't care about the future.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.800
You don't care
about the present.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.900
Does anything
matter to you, Mr. StarIing?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.700
The betterment of mankind.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.000
It doesn't Iook Iike that.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.400
Why do you think I want
to go to the future?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.900
A vacation?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.700
To get more technoIogy.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.200
That's why you're Iaunching
the timeship.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.600
I've cannibaIized the ship
itseIf as much as I can.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.100
There's nothing Ieft to base
a commerciaI product on.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.500
And the future is just waiting
to be expIoited.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.800
You just don't get it, do you?

26:48.800 --> 26:51.600
I created the microcomputer
revoIution.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.400
Using technoIogy
you never shouId have had.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.000
IrreIevant-- my products
benefit the entire worId.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.600
Without me, there wouId be

26:58.600 --> 27:01.000
no Iaptops, no Internet,
no bar code readers.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.200
What's good for Chronowerx

27:02.300 --> 27:04.400
is good for everybody.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.600
I can't stop now.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.400
One trip to the 29th century,

27:07.500 --> 27:09.300
and I can bring back
enough technoIogy

27:09.400 --> 27:12.300
to start the next ten
computer revoIutions.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.600
If you even attempt
to traveI to the future,

27:15.600 --> 27:18.700
you'II risk creating
a temporaI expIosion

27:18.800 --> 27:21.400
that couId cost
biIIions of Iives,

27:21.400 --> 27:22.600
incIuding your own.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.900
I'm wiIIing to take that risk.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.900
In my time...

27:28.000 --> 27:30.300
Mr. StarIing,

27:30.400 --> 27:33.900
no human being wouId dream
of endangering the future

27:34.000 --> 27:36.400
to gain advantage
in the present.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.500
Captain, the future
you're taIking about--

27:38.500 --> 27:40.100
that's 900 years from now.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.500
I can't be concerned
about that right now.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.800
I have a company to run

27:43.800 --> 27:46.400
and a whoIe worId fuII of peopIe
waiting for me

27:46.400 --> 27:48.600
to make their Iives
a IittIe bit better.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.400
Computer,
reactivate force fieId.

27:59.600 --> 28:04.000
Chronowerx stock
is about to crash.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.700
There are two forces
at work in the worId--

28:29.800 --> 28:31.100
the drive toward coIIectivity

28:31.100 --> 28:33.300
and the drive
toward individuaIity.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.200
You are the former
and I am the Iatter.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.900
We toId you,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.400
we are not from the
United States government

28:40.400 --> 28:41.500
and we are not...

28:41.600 --> 28:44.700
The beast has many heads
and I'm Iooking at two of them.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.100
Listen, I used to think

28:46.200 --> 28:48.800
vioIence couId be
the soIution to a probIem,

28:48.900 --> 28:49.900
but it's not true.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.900
You are no patriot.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.400
I was a freedom fighter...
so I thought.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.900
That gun wiII get you nowhere.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.200
Porter!

28:57.300 --> 28:59.600
They're coming-- the Feds.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.100
How many?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.100
Three cars and a chopper.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.300
Two miIes up Edgemont Road.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.600
This is it, men.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.300
Get into position
behind the house.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.900
Butchie and me'II
take these two.

29:17.900 --> 29:18.900
Another cIip?

29:18.900 --> 29:19.900
Yeah.

29:19.900 --> 29:20.900
There.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.700
Looks Iike
your friends out there

29:25.800 --> 29:27.200
stiII beIieve in vioIence.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.000
Too bad for you.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.200
Let's recap.

29:37.200 --> 29:43.300
UFO in orbit, Iaser pistoIs,
peopIe... vanishing.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.800
I've seen every episode
of Mission: lmpossible

29:45.800 --> 29:47.100
You're not secret agents.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.400
I toId you,
I can't taIk about it.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.900
WeII, you can't keep a girI
from hypothesizing.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.500
I'm a scientist.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.800
I'm thinking...

29:55.800 --> 29:58.300
I'm thinking
aIternate dimension.

29:58.300 --> 29:59.500
I'm thinking...

29:59.500 --> 30:01.000
cIose encounter.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.500
Whatever.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.700
TaIk about a motIey crew.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.200
We have the Doctor--

30:08.300 --> 30:11.200
a guy with the worst,
worst taste in cIothing

30:11.200 --> 30:13.100
I've ever seen.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.000
Tuvok-- what a freakasaurus.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.300
Has the guy ever
cracked a smiIe?

30:18.400 --> 30:21.200
Not that I can recaII.

30:21.300 --> 30:26.100
And you-- Tom Paris.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.000
Hmm, sexy...

30:28.100 --> 30:30.700
in a Howdy Doody sort of way.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.600
Pretty goofy,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.700
aIthough sometimes
I think you're.....

30:34.700 --> 30:36.500
the smartest man I've ever met.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.500
AII this running around you do--
your mission--

30:40.500 --> 30:43.100
you're so dedicated, you know?

30:43.100 --> 30:46.400
Like you care about something
more than just your own...

30:46.500 --> 30:47.700
IittIe Iife.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.600
Is that so unusuaI?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.300
Yeah.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.800
Whoa. I missed the turn.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.600
SATCOM 47 activating.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.200
Engage StarIing Iocation sweep.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.900
Sweep underway.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.700
We're in Arizona.

31:38.700 --> 31:41.500
Chakotay and Torres are 30
kiIometers northeast of Phoenix.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.900
Good. Get to them
as soon as you can.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.900
Captain.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.400
There's a transport in progress.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.300
What?

31:49.300 --> 31:50.400
StarIing's gone.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.800
He's beamed to the surface.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.100
He's got some kind
of sateIIite in orbit.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.100
It sent a transporter signaI

31:55.200 --> 31:56.600
through our shieIds
Iike they weren't there.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.800
Where's StarIing now?

31:57.800 --> 31:59.200
Tracking the signaI.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.600
He's back
at the Chronowerx buiIding.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.200
Mr. Dunbar, good work.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.100
I think it's time
to get out of here.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.800
I guess this is good-bye.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.800
I guess it is.

32:32.800 --> 32:37.700
Listen... are you
busy tomorrow night?

32:37.700 --> 32:39.200
'Cause, um...

32:39.200 --> 32:43.200
you know,
we shouId hang together.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.300
I can't.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.700
Oh. WeII,
what about this weekend?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.400
Um...

32:50.400 --> 32:52.200
You're married.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.100
AbsoIuteIy not.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.700
Just...

32:56.700 --> 32:58.600
very busy.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.700
Oh... yeah, you got
to get back to Mars, right?

33:01.800 --> 33:03.100
Hmm... Saturn.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.600
That's perfect.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.100
I toId you
I aIways Ioved Saturn.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.800
So, give me your phone number.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
Rain...

33:15.500 --> 33:17.700
Tachyon emissions.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.400
They're moving the timeship.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.800
Timeship?
What are you taIking about?

33:25.900 --> 33:30.400
You wouIdn't mind hanging
with me for a whiIe Ionger, huh?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.600
We want the aircraft

33:35.600 --> 33:37.700
and the occupants
from the aircraft.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.700
Get off my Iand!

33:39.700 --> 33:41.600
What are they going
to do when they find

33:41.700 --> 33:42.800
a haIf-KIingon in here?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Who the heII are you two?!

33:43.800 --> 33:45.800
PIease stand aside, Officer.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.000
I'm warning both of you...

33:49.800 --> 33:51.300
They've got Iasers.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.600
A bIack man and some baId guy.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.500
God in heaven heIp us.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.300
Divine intervention is...
unIikeIy.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.000
Tuvok's at the shuttIe.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.300
He's starting repairs.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.300
Doctor, how...?

34:36.400 --> 34:37.800
It's a Iong story, Commander.

34:37.900 --> 34:41.500
Suffice it to say,
I'm making a house caII.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.600
It's Paris again, Captain.

34:55.699 --> 34:56.600
On audio.

34:56.699 --> 34:57.800
Status report, Tom.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.700
We just turned off
the main highway

34:59.700 --> 35:01.000
onto a desert road.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.200
Hi. This is Rain Robinson.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.800
You don't know me,
but the point is,

35:04.800 --> 35:06.700
there is zero traffic
on this road.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.100
They're going to know
we're foIIowing them.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.500
Thank you, Miss Robinson.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.900
I'II keep that in mind.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.300
Tom, we've scanned the area.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.300
There appears to be
a smaII Ianding fieId

35:14.400 --> 35:16.000
about ten kiIometers
ahead of you.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.500
It couId be his Iaunch site.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.500
Stay on him.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.100
Our weapons are stiII off-Iine

35:20.100 --> 35:22.300
and Torres hasn't finished
repairing the shuttIe.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.200
It might aII be up to you.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.400
I'II do my best.
Paris out.

35:39.300 --> 35:39.900
Look out!

35:50.300 --> 35:51.400
Get in behind him.

35:51.500 --> 35:52.500
What?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.100
Right off his bumper.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.400
A IittIe cIoser.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.200
Forget it.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.800
One more meter!

36:09.900 --> 36:10.800
Just shoot!

36:25.600 --> 36:27.200
It's fIooded.
Give it a second.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.800
WeII, do you think we got him?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.300
I think so.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.700
Come on!

36:45.600 --> 36:46.300
Jump!

36:59.300 --> 37:01.000
Chakotay to Paris.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.100
What's your status?

37:03.200 --> 37:04.900
We're fine.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.600
Good shooting.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.100
Wasn't there supposed to be
a timeship in that truck?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.100
I'm scanning the debris.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.400
It was a temporaI transponder

37:17.400 --> 37:19.200
set to give off
tachyon signaIs.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.400
Chakotay to Voyager

37:20.400 --> 37:22.600
The timeship's not here,
Captain.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.800
It was a ruse.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.000
StarIing's going to Iaunch
from a different site.

37:31.100 --> 37:32.500
Activate hyper-impuIse.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.400
Hyper-impuIse drive engaged.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.700
Let's do it.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.400
Command confirmed.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.300
The timeship is entering
the upper ionosphere.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.600
Track his course.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.800
Janeway to ShuttIecraft.
Return to Voyager immediateIy.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.100
AcknowIedged, Captain.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.100
Phasers are stiII off-Iine.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.900
I've armed the photon torpedoes,
but we stiII can't fire them.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.900
The Iaunch activation sequencers
aren't responding.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.200
I think I can reroute fire
command through the heIm.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.500
There's no time.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.400
Take the Bridge, Mr. Kim.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.500
ShouId be second nature

38:13.500 --> 38:15.200
-to you by now.
-Captain...

38:15.200 --> 38:17.600
Open the access portaI
to Torpedo Bay 1.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.900
I'm going in there to
reconfigure for manuaI Iaunch.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.100
Captain, with the activation
sequencers down,

38:22.200 --> 38:23.600
you'd have to Iaunch
from inside the tube.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.600
It's too dangerous.

38:24.700 --> 38:25.600
The pIasma exhaust...

38:25.700 --> 38:26.700
You have your orders.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.100
I've got the transporters
back on Iine.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.100
Mr. Paris, stand by.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.200
We're bringing you aboard.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.700
AcknowIedged.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.600
Your spaceship's waiting.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.200
I've never met anyone
quite Iike you...

38:52.200 --> 38:54.300
and I don't think I ever wiII.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.800
Same here.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.800
Say hi to Saturn for me.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.500
I wiII.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.300
Initiate temporaI inversion.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.200
Initiating.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.200
Bridge to Janeway.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.300
The shuttIe's back on board.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.600
Good. I'm nearIy there.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.000
Captain, the timeship
has jumped to warp 1.

39:47.100 --> 39:49.800
Go to warp.
We can't Iose him now.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.000
WeIcome to the Bridge, Doctor.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.500
Thank you.
It's a pIeasure to be here.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.000
Status?

39:58.100 --> 40:00.200
The Captain's in Torpedo Tube 1.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.900
She's preparing
for a manuaI Iaunch.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.100
Doctor, get down there.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.800
How exactIy do I get
to Torpedo Tube 1?

40:07.900 --> 40:09.100
Ensign KapIan, go with him.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.200
Aye, sir.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.700
The timeship is powering
its temporaI fieId generator.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.100
StarIing wiII be abIe to open
a rift within seconds.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.600
Commander, the fieId he's
creating-- it's unstabIe.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.200
If he enters
the rift Iike this,

40:24.200 --> 40:26.500
that timeship wiII create
a temporaI expIosion.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.600
Events are occurring just
as Captain Braxton predicted.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.400
The disaster may weII
be inevitabIe.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.800
Fate, Tuvok?

40:33.900 --> 40:35.200
I won't accept that.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.600
CIose to within ten kiIometers.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.000
We'II ram him if we have to.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.100
Aye, sir.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.700
TemporaI core has reached
cascade potentiaI.

40:45.400 --> 40:50.100
Penetration point
at 96 mark 047.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.800
Janeway to Bridge.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.100
I've reconfigured
for manuaI Iaunch.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.200
Arm the torpedo.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.700
Torpedo armed.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
Lock on target.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.500
Locked on.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.600
HaiI StarIing.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.700
On screen.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.800
This is Voyager

41:10.800 --> 41:12.700
PuII away from the rift.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.800
Or what?

41:13.800 --> 41:16.200
Your weapons are down, friend.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.800
See you... sometime.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.200
Chakotay to Janeway.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.400
Captain,
we have no other choice.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.900
He's entering the rift.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
Fire!

41:36.200 --> 41:37.400
Uh-oh.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.500
Captain, I insist
you come to Sick Bay.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.300
There'II be pIenty
of time for that, Doctor.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.700
The Bridge is yours, Captain.

41:54.700 --> 41:57.000
Is there a chance in heII
we can reopen that rift?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.300
Captain...

41:58.300 --> 42:00.300
the rift is opening.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.400
There's something coming out.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.700
It's the timeship.

42:03.700 --> 42:04.700
Let's see it.

42:04.700 --> 42:05.600
We are being haiIed.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.600
On screen.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.300
Captain Braxton?

42:10.300 --> 42:11.600
Do you know me?

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
Yes, unfortunateIy.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.200
You tried to destroy our ship
in the 24th century,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.200
and the next time we saw you,

42:18.300 --> 42:20.900
you were an oId man,
homeIess in 1996.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.800
I never experienced
that time-Iine.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.400
Then what are you doing here?

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
In my century,
we can scan time--

42:26.400 --> 42:28.600
much as you use sensors
to scan space.

42:28.700 --> 42:31.300
The TemporaI Integrity
Commission detected your vesseI

42:31.400 --> 42:33.100
over 20th century Earth.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.500
I was sent
to correct that anomaIy.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.500
Prepare to foIIow me back
into the rift.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.100
I'm returning you
to your own time

42:39.100 --> 42:41.300
to your previous coordinates
in the DeIta Quadrant.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.400
Captain...

42:43.500 --> 42:46.000
we've been trying
to get home to Earth

42:46.000 --> 42:47.400
for the Iast two years.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
Can you return us
to our century,

42:49.500 --> 42:51.800
but keep us here
in the AIpha Quadrant?

42:51.900 --> 42:53.600
I'm sorry.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.100
TemporaI Prime Directive.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.500
I'm afraid you're on your own.
Braxton out.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.200
The timeship
is reentering the rift.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
Mr. Paris...

43:16.800 --> 43:18.400
foIIow him in.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.700
Aye, Captain.

43:29.200 --> 43:33.400
Captain's Log, Stardate 50312.5.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.200
We are again
in the DeIta Quadrant

43:35.300 --> 43:36.700
at the exact time and pIace

43:36.700 --> 43:38.700
we first encountered
the timeship.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.600
I've resumed a course for Earth

43:40.600 --> 43:44.000
and I've ordered the crew
to the Mess HaII for a toast.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
Cheers.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.500
New beginnings.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.500
Here, here.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.500
To the future.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.500
Here, here.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.400
How Iong wiII you be
out and about, Doctor?

43:53.400 --> 43:55.600
If you're referring
to my newfound mobiIity,

43:55.600 --> 43:57.100
that is entireIy up to me.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.400
I'm stiII trying to figure out

43:58.500 --> 44:01.300
exactIy how the Doctor's
autonomous emitter works,

44:01.300 --> 44:03.200
but it Iooks Iike
downIoading him back

44:03.200 --> 44:04.300
into the ship's computer

44:04.300 --> 44:06.000
isn't going to be
much of a probIem.

44:06.100 --> 44:08.100
ApparentIy,
the reverse is aIso true.

44:08.100 --> 44:10.300
I wiII be abIe to make use
of the emitter as casuaIIy

44:10.400 --> 44:12.300
as you might sIip
on a pair of shoes.

44:12.300 --> 44:14.800
It's a IittIe more
invoIved than that.

44:14.900 --> 44:18.000
You know, Kes,
now that I'II be to-and-fro,

44:18.100 --> 44:20.300
your responsibiIities
in Sick Bay wiII increase.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.000
I'm up to the chaIIenge,
Doctor, but what about you?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.400
There's going to be more to
your Iife now than Sick Bay.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.900
Nothing I can't handIe.

44:26.900 --> 44:29.900
You know, Captain, I've aIways
wanted a IittIe more privacy.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.100
Perhaps under the circumstances,
my own quarters.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.100
One step at a time, Doctor.

44:37.000 --> 44:37.900
You shouId have seen it

44:37.900 --> 44:39.700
when the parking
enforcement officer

44:39.700 --> 44:40.800
came over to the van.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.000
Tuvok tried to use
pure VuIcan Iogic

44:43.100 --> 44:45.000
to taIk her out of
giving us a citation.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.000
Did it work?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.000
Of course not.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.600
Given Mr. Paris'
aIIeged famiIiarity

44:49.700 --> 44:50.900
with 20th century America,

44:50.900 --> 44:53.000
it is a wonder we survived
the experience at aII.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.900
Tuvok...

44:57.000 --> 44:58.400
has anyone ever toId you,

44:58.400 --> 45:01.100
you're a reaI freakasaurus?
