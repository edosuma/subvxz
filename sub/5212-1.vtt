29:50.155 --> 29:52.157
Why'd you keep it low?

29:52.223 --> 29:54.863
Hey. Kelly!
Huh?

29:54.926 --> 29:56.496
You kept it low?

29:56.561 --> 29:59.064
Kept it low.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.406
Barnstorming's like ice skating.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.504
Skimming.

30:04.569 --> 30:08.142
You descend and you let the
floats dance a couple times

30:08.206 --> 30:12.552
with the surface before you
take off again.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.819
At 40 feet... or what
I thought was 40 feet...

30:15.880 --> 30:20.522
It was foggy, had to depend
on my instruments.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.030
They let you down.

30:22.087 --> 30:25.034
Must have been a faulty
altimeter.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.570
I thought, uh,
the water was further away

30:27.625 --> 30:32.870
than it turned out to be and
the floats caught the surface.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.241
Stupid.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.940
Anybody can make a mistake.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.142
Why don't you just
keep paddling?

30:41.206 --> 30:42.685
What are you doing out here?

30:42.741 --> 30:45.449
Middle of lake Michigan in
this old tub with no food,

30:45.510 --> 30:46.648
no phone.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.155
How far did you
think you were going to get

30:48.179 --> 30:50.420
in this old dinghy without
more gas?

30:50.482 --> 30:54.521
Sounds stupid to me.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.065
Sounds stupid.

31:03.261 --> 31:09.234
♪

31:37.061 --> 31:38.404
(coughing)

31:58.483 --> 32:02.625
I overheard in
a restaurant recently.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.328
The guy said that every
day there are signs

32:06.391 --> 32:09.167
or messengers that
come into our life to help us

32:09.227 --> 32:13.437
only most of us can't see them.

32:13.498 --> 32:16.069
What?

32:16.134 --> 32:18.705
I just don't think like that.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.875
Think like how?

32:20.939 --> 32:24.978
I tried to think
like that and I realized

32:25.043 --> 32:30.994
that most of my life has
to do with water.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.620
Body's made up of mostly water.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.291
I drink a ton of water.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.891
Love to swim in water.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.494
I'm even a water sign.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.800
Pisces.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.739
Think that's the kind
of sign he meant?

32:45.797 --> 32:48.641
I don't know.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.043
What are those two?

32:56.641 --> 32:59.451
Bleach and nitroglycerin.

33:06.284 --> 33:09.663
Is that why you're out here?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.327
That was the basic idea.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.303
What the hell kind of way is
that to kill yourself?

33:15.360 --> 33:16.100
I don't know.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.400
Bleach and nitroglycerin...

33:17.462 --> 33:21.035
Are you some
kind of poet or something?

33:21.099 --> 33:24.012
What kind of idiot are you?

33:24.068 --> 33:26.014
What's up with that?

33:26.070 --> 33:27.640
There are guys who do
it violent ways.

33:27.705 --> 33:28.706
A car.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.377
A gun.

33:30.441 --> 33:33.422
Way you're trying to do it is
like a woman would do it.

33:33.478 --> 33:37.824
Carbon monoxide,
pills, poison liquid shit.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.190
Guys don't give a shit.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.558
Gun to the head, bam.

33:40.618 --> 33:42.894
You're out of here.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.194
I'll tell you what.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.098
Why don't you take
this, okay, huh?

33:46.157 --> 33:48.262
Knife to the heart?

33:48.326 --> 33:49.464
End it.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.131
No?

33:51.195 --> 33:53.072
I've had this since high school.

33:53.131 --> 33:56.544
It would be an honor for
it to take a life.

33:56.601 --> 33:57.602
No?

33:57.669 --> 33:58.875
I'll tell you what.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.541
I'm going to put this over there

34:00.605 --> 34:02.816
and if you summon enough stupid
fucking courage to do it,

34:02.840 --> 34:07.152
it'll be easy to get at.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.452
In the meantime, keep paddling.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.061
Nitroglycerin?

34:14.118 --> 34:15.824
It's liquid dynamite.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.128
Where'd you get that shit?

34:18.188 --> 34:19.896
How are you planning
on doing it?

34:19.958 --> 34:21.118
What difference does it make?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.603
You gonna drink it?

34:22.659 --> 34:25.937
Jump up and down until you
fucking explode?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.089
You asshole holdout.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.960
You want some?

34:48.018 --> 34:50.465
Yeah.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.228
Don't eat all of it.

34:52.290 --> 34:56.329
It's my mother's recipe.

34:56.393 --> 35:00.103
These are great.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.444
Your mother know you're out here

35:01.499 --> 35:04.002
planning on doing what
you're doing?

35:04.068 --> 35:06.514
Yeah, she knows.

35:06.571 --> 35:10.383
Whether or not she can actually
comprehend anything is a.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.320
She dead?

35:13.378 --> 35:15.881
Alzheimer's.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.949
Oh man.

35:18.016 --> 35:21.463
Six years.

35:21.519 --> 35:26.901
Your wife or girlfriend
know you're out here?

35:26.958 --> 35:29.996
I'm not married
and I don't have a girlfriend.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.085
How are you, Kelly?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.589
Hey, john.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.625
I'm good.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.956
You been working some
seriously long hours.

35:52.016 --> 35:54.121
Yeah.

35:54.185 --> 35:57.689
Need any extra money beyond
the overtime?

35:57.755 --> 35:59.325
Yeah.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.494
Okay.

36:00.558 --> 36:03.937
Take this backpack
to your first stop.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.703
Leave before dawn, make
the connection,

36:06.764 --> 36:09.438
three grand is yours.

36:09.500 --> 36:14.677
You in?

36:14.739 --> 36:17.618
Yeah.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.416
That's good.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.026
(plane passing overhead)

36:29.153 --> 36:32.225
when's your birthday?

36:32.290 --> 36:33.394
Mid-march.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.563
What day?

36:35.626 --> 36:37.230
The 21st.

36:37.295 --> 36:38.899
You said you were
a Pisces, right?

36:38.963 --> 36:40.704
Yeah.

36:40.765 --> 36:44.907
How were you delivered?

36:44.969 --> 36:47.609
What?
Caesarean or natural?

36:47.672 --> 36:48.878
How do I know?

36:48.940 --> 36:51.011
Was your mother into astrology?

36:51.075 --> 36:52.713
I have no idea.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.552
My wife knew this woman.

36:54.612 --> 36:57.491
She was expecting, so she had
the doctor do a caesarian

36:57.548 --> 36:59.186
so the kid
would be a Sagittarius

36:59.250 --> 37:00.627
instead of a Scorpio.

37:00.685 --> 37:02.365
So what does that have
to do with anything?

37:02.420 --> 37:03.524
You're a Pisces.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.199
But maybe only because
your mom didn't want you

37:05.223 --> 37:08.397
to be an Aries or a Taurus
or a Leo or some shit.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.564
You saying she messed with
my fate on purpose?

37:10.628 --> 37:12.369
Maybe.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.841
No.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.707
No... no!

37:15.766 --> 37:16.886
The bag was open, all right?

37:16.934 --> 37:17.810
The bottle was in my hand.

37:17.869 --> 37:18.870
The decision was made.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.381
Ow!

37:20.438 --> 37:22.483
Are you trying to tell me that
this isn't my destiny?

37:22.507 --> 37:23.717
Is that what you're
trying to say?

37:23.741 --> 37:25.584
It doesn't have to be.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.726

You need attention.

I don't know who I'm

they'll send guys after me.

And who are you but here
and dead?

39:35.506 --> 39:36.507
What drop?

39:36.574 --> 39:40.249
There's a sealed GPS tracker
in this bag.

30 minutes late.

39:45.950 --> 39:46.985
What?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.531
They send guys after you.

39:49.587 --> 39:50.864
Are you like some kind
of messenger?

39:50.888 --> 39:53.494
A courier.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.595
This lake has shipping
lanes across it.

39:56.661 --> 39:57.799
Up in the sky there's some

39:57.862 --> 39:59.170
transportation highway
connecting

39:59.230 --> 40:00.834
the bordering states.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.344
Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.711
They criss-cross it a couple
times a day.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.977
It's faster than driving.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.213
And there are no cops.

40:11.275 --> 40:14.347
Fact is, I was looking for
their boat or their plane

40:14.412 --> 40:17.723
since you
pulled me out of the water.

40:17.782 --> 40:20.661
What would they need you for if
they have access to a plane?

40:20.718 --> 40:22.994
Minimize their risk.

40:23.054 --> 40:27.696
I get popped,
I'm just a courier.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.465
If I could have got those
skiers attention,

40:29.527 --> 40:32.167
could have dumped me off
with them and been on your way

40:32.229 --> 40:36.371
and when you were alone,
done the deed.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.380
Now you're in
the middle of my shit.

Fine.

Thanks.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.788
What are you doing?

41:25.850 --> 41:29.024
I am going fishing.

41:29.086 --> 41:30.656
Like that?

41:30.721 --> 41:32.132
Yeah.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.189
Something my dad and I used
to do when I was a kid.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.174
Are you kidding me?

41:42.233 --> 41:45.009
They got 100-pound salmon
in this lake.

41:45.069 --> 41:47.049
It'll take your toe right off.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.656
Oh!
No.

42:04.722 --> 42:05.860
Yeah.
No.

42:05.923 --> 42:07.231
Yeah.
Did you get a bite?

42:07.291 --> 42:08.929
Watch this.
You got a fish?

42:08.993 --> 42:11.234
I do...
Look at this.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.940
It's a walleye.
You got yourself a fish.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.111
There's no place to cook it.

42:24.175 --> 42:29.523
Too small anyway...
Toss it back.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.957
Throw it back.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.731
You all right?

42:44.795 --> 42:47.173
Yeah, I'm all right.

43:01.445 --> 43:03.516
Here.

43:15.759 --> 43:21.402
Where is everybody...
I'm seasick.

43:21.465 --> 43:23.672
Put a little pressure
on your wrist.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.213
What?

43:25.269 --> 43:28.273
Like this, it'll
help with the seasickness.

43:28.339 --> 43:30.512
H ow?

43:30.574 --> 43:33.350
Three fingers below
the crease of your wrist.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.481
Put... like that... between
the tendons.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.150
Just hold it.

43:37.214 --> 43:38.955
I got a broken arm.

43:39.016 --> 43:40.586
I'll do it for you.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.371
Like that.

43:55.065 --> 43:57.045
Feels weird.

44:01.572 --> 44:03.950
You ever try to
kill yourself before?

44:04.008 --> 44:05.487
I've thought about it.

44:05.543 --> 44:08.251
Who hasn't?

44:08.312 --> 44:10.451
Actually, I have tried
a couple times.

44:10.514 --> 44:11.549
Yeah?

44:11.615 --> 44:12.650
Last week, in fact.

44:12.716 --> 44:14.787
I was on the bridge
on the south side of town.

44:14.852 --> 44:16.796
I just pulled on the wheel of
the car to try to get it

44:16.820 --> 44:18.731
to jump over the guard rail.

44:18.789 --> 44:20.234
I would have fallen 200 feet

44:20.291 --> 44:22.897
into the industrial floor below.

44:22.960 --> 44:23.995
What the hell?

44:24.061 --> 44:25.768
The curb was too high.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.035
My wheel base was too low.

44:27.097 --> 44:28.341
So the car just
kind of banged off the wall

44:28.365 --> 44:31.244
and the tire just skidded along.

44:31.302 --> 44:34.840
Ever try to do something like
that when you're sober?

44:34.905 --> 44:36.111
No.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.813
You were drunk.

44:38.876 --> 44:41.220
A little drunk.
A little.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.417
Which means it was a botched
attempt, I think.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.323
You think it's easy,
you try it some time.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.623
This attempt on the boat
botched too, I think.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.629
I didn't botch this attempt.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.686
You botched it for me.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.064
And I'm not drunk.
Yet.

44:52.122 --> 44:53.133
What, you never messed up
this bad?

44:53.157 --> 44:54.329
No.
You crashed.

44:54.391 --> 44:55.495
Yeah.

44:55.559 --> 44:57.270
You crashed your plane
and almost killed yourself.

44:57.294 --> 44:59.069
Yeah, but I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

44:59.129 --> 45:00.540
Those skiers
might have rescued you,

45:00.598 --> 45:02.942
which means I'm not responsible
for you if you die.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.308
Me on the other hand...
What?

45:04.368 --> 45:05.779
It's because of me that my
father had a job.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.077
Okay.

45:07.137 --> 45:09.174
Someone died because of a
decision that I made.

45:09.239 --> 45:10.240
Almost like you just did.

45:10.307 --> 45:11.377
No way...
I had a choice.

45:11.442 --> 45:12.786
With our help...
People have choices.

45:12.810 --> 45:14.585
With our influence...

45:14.645 --> 45:16.690
Even if you don't make a choice,
it's a choice. we are who we are.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.625
Your dad... we're
talking about your dad here!

45:18.682 --> 45:20.787
Are you a man or a mouse?
We are who we are.

45:20.851 --> 45:22.353
You're a mouse.

45:25.489 --> 45:27.300
When I was a child, my mother
used to say to me,

45:27.324 --> 45:30.771
"if you had another
brain, it would be lonesome."

45:30.828 --> 45:34.037
Talking to you, I finally
understand what she meant.

45:38.836 --> 45:41.112
Regret?

45:41.171 --> 45:42.946
The worst thing about it

45:43.007 --> 45:49.583
is it's like
a debt you can never repay.

45:49.647 --> 45:51.285
We'll see.

45:51.348 --> 45:53.259
Are you like this with women?

45:53.317 --> 45:57.493
Like what?
A pain in the ass.

45:57.554 --> 45:59.966
I don't go out much.

46:00.024 --> 46:03.528
You should get a hobby
or exercise more.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.403
You like to
swim, you should swim.

46:24.048 --> 46:28.019
You married?

46:28.085 --> 46:32.124
Yeah.

46:32.189 --> 46:34.692
Got a picture in my wallet.

46:34.758 --> 46:35.828
A fold-out thing.

46:35.893 --> 46:37.304
Here.

46:52.042 --> 46:54.852
That's my family.

46:54.912 --> 46:58.086
Beautiful.

46:58.148 --> 47:02.563
We were living
in a really nice house.

47:02.619 --> 47:05.099
Way beyond our means, actually

47:08.392 --> 47:11.965
Then the economy
tanked and they cut my hours.

47:12.029 --> 47:14.566
My wife got laid off.

47:14.631 --> 47:16.941
Love you, dad... have a good day.
Mm-hmm.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.538
Love you too.

47:20.604 --> 47:22.982
Started looking into anything
including franchises.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.453
There were some
good ones out there.

47:26.510 --> 47:33.450
For some reason, the good ones
didn't interest me.

47:33.517 --> 47:37.659
There was one in
particular that seemed easy.

47:37.721 --> 47:41.692
Wasn't really my thing, but I
had to have something

47:41.759 --> 47:45.798
and we were running out of time.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.810
It was that stupid stop sign

47:48.866 --> 47:50.812
at the corner of grey fox
and fourth.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.078
And you're
coming down the big hill

47:52.102 --> 47:53.706
and you can see a million
miles each way

47:53.771 --> 47:54.943
that no cars are coming.

47:55.005 --> 47:56.325
You have to make that
sharp right.

47:56.373 --> 47:58.017
So what's the point
of coming to a full stop?

47:58.041 --> 47:59.520
Because it's against the law.

47:59.576 --> 48:02.557
I've seen you do it...
Why... why do you do this?

48:02.613 --> 48:04.524
I don't want to use my
brakes for that.

48:04.581 --> 48:05.582
What?

48:05.649 --> 48:07.560
I don't want
to use my brakes that much.

48:07.618 --> 48:08.926
Why?

48:08.986 --> 48:10.130
To save them...
To save money.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.690
Okay, I'll tell you what.

48:11.755 --> 48:14.429
Next few times we want
to go out to dinner, we won't.

48:14.491 --> 48:17.062
That'll cover the cost
of the brakes.

48:17.127 --> 48:19.107
Use your brakes.

48:23.167 --> 48:24.942
Got so bad
we almost moved into this

48:25.002 --> 48:27.812
really crappy trailer park.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.784
So what was the easy franchise?

48:30.841 --> 48:33.014
Selling electronic cigarettes.

48:33.076 --> 48:34.384
Can you believe it?

48:34.444 --> 48:38.722
Electronic cigarettes...
Me, a health nut.

48:38.782 --> 48:42.025
They don't make real smoke.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.531
I mean.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.329
So I took on more courier hours

48:46.390 --> 48:50.497
'cause I wanted to spend
more time with my family.

48:50.561 --> 48:52.905
You get the picture.

48:52.963 --> 48:54.007
After you've been you've been
in jail a while,

48:54.031 --> 48:57.501
would it seem worth it?

48:57.568 --> 49:00.708
At least I'm trying, which is
more than I can say for you.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.546
Really?

49:02.606 --> 49:05.018
Look, I've forgotten more about
living than you've ever known.

49:05.042 --> 49:08.546
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.683
You get to be a pilot.

49:10.747 --> 49:13.751
How many people in
this world get to be a pilot?

49:13.817 --> 49:15.057
You'd be surprised.

49:15.118 --> 49:17.359
Some money and a bunch of hours,

49:17.421 --> 49:19.901
you can pilot a plane.

49:19.957 --> 49:23.461
Remember, I carry
parcels, not people.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.666
It's a whole different
licensing process,

49:25.729 --> 49:27.340
if you want to be
rated to fly anything bigger

49:27.364 --> 49:29.742
than a twin engine
six passenger.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.939
Still.

49:32.002 --> 49:34.141
I mean, one in nine
people in Alaska

49:34.204 --> 49:36.184
have their pilot's license.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.914
Probably out of necessity.

49:38.976 --> 49:42.185
(coughing)

49:46.783 --> 49:48.262
Oh!

49:54.992 --> 49:56.130
Here.

50:01.365 --> 50:03.572
Thanks.

50:03.634 --> 50:05.636
Tastes good.

50:07.905 --> 50:10.317
How's it look?

50:10.374 --> 50:11.546
It's okay.

50:19.449 --> 50:21.360
What's your wife's name?
Kim.

50:21.418 --> 50:25.889
Kim?

50:25.956 --> 50:29.130
You ever think we're kinda
supposed to be like,

50:29.192 --> 50:30.899
what our names are?

50:30.961 --> 50:34.067
You know,
like, Robert Brickhouse

50:34.131 --> 50:36.771
or Karen light or me,

50:36.833 --> 50:39.814
Mitch, Mitch Lowe.

50:39.870 --> 50:46.810
Am I supposed to be low 'cause
that's what my name is?

50:46.877 --> 50:48.356
You don't like it, change it.

50:48.412 --> 50:50.449
If it doesn't matter,
don't do it.

50:50.514 --> 50:51.584
Yeah?

50:51.648 --> 50:55.687
What would Kim Enwright have
to say about it?

50:55.752 --> 50:59.063
Mrs. Enwright would say...

50:59.122 --> 51:00.658
"don't be stupid."

51:06.730 --> 51:10.371
They have a new male raptor
at the nature center.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.414
Red-tailed hawk.

51:12.469 --> 51:18.715
And I just figured out yesterday
that he only has two eyelids.

51:18.775 --> 51:23.554
Now all raptors are
supposed to have three eyelids.

51:23.613 --> 51:28.119
They have an upper lid
and a lower lid

51:28.185 --> 51:30.187
and they have this
third, transparent eyelid

51:30.253 --> 51:35.362
that closes laterally
across the eyes.

51:35.425 --> 51:38.668
And this one
keeps the eyes moist

51:38.729 --> 51:42.506
and it protects their eyes
when they're flying

51:42.566 --> 51:46.309
and it protects their eyes when
they're eating.

51:46.370 --> 51:51.149
But this little guy
just doesn't have that.

51:51.208 --> 51:57.591
Doesn't have that extra bit
of protection.

51:57.647 --> 51:59.820
That's me, Kel.

51:59.883 --> 52:03.262
I'm that extra
bit of protection.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.994
You have to let me in.

52:06.056 --> 52:08.536
You don't, you
don't have to shoulder

52:08.592 --> 52:10.367
everything by yourself, baby,

52:10.427 --> 52:13.636
but I can't help
if you don't let me in.

52:30.881 --> 52:36.058
(Mitch urinating)

52:36.920 --> 52:38.331
holy cow.

52:38.388 --> 52:43.337
Didn't realize we were that
close to Niagara falls.

52:43.393 --> 52:44.633
Jeez.

52:44.694 --> 52:45.900
Now I gotta take a leak.

52:45.962 --> 52:47.964
Got a pail or anything?

52:50.133 --> 52:53.307
God... oh god.

52:53.370 --> 52:55.475
Put it down there.
Just put it down there.

52:59.443 --> 53:01.650
(urinating)

53:09.619 --> 53:12.828
I miss my family.

53:12.889 --> 53:15.961
Probably just
getting out of tae kwon do.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.596
Tae kwon do?

53:17.661 --> 53:19.402
Yeah, they're probably
going rollerblading

53:19.463 --> 53:20.737
or maybe to a movie.

53:20.797 --> 53:22.003
Shit.

53:25.268 --> 53:29.011
I think I'm off by an hour or so

53:29.072 --> 53:30.750
seeing as how we're
in the middle of a lake.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.685
What does the middle of the lake
have to do with anything?

53:32.709 --> 53:37.590
Well, we're smack dab
on top of the time zone line.

53:37.647 --> 53:39.126
Really?

53:39.182 --> 53:42.561
Time's almost right down
the middle of the lake, huh?

53:42.619 --> 53:43.563
I didn't know that.

53:43.620 --> 53:44.655
Yeah.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.598
(radio signal coming
through intermittently

53:46.656 --> 53:48.363
brewers are pretty good
this year.

53:48.425 --> 53:49.563
Yeah?

53:53.830 --> 53:55.639
(grunting)

53:59.603 --> 54:01.412
yeah.
(radio station playing football game)

54:01.471 --> 54:03.951
there you go.

54:04.007 --> 54:05.350
That's good.

54:08.945 --> 54:12.392
You know what the laws are
in Michigan concerning suicide?

54:12.449 --> 54:13.723
Oh, come on.

54:13.783 --> 54:16.889
'Cause if we're closer
to Michigan than Wisconsin,

54:16.953 --> 54:20.366
there could be stiffer fees
and penalties.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.301
Are you telling me that someone
came up with a law

54:22.325 --> 54:24.327
against killing yourself?

54:24.394 --> 54:25.930
Of course there's suicide laws.

54:25.996 --> 54:29.239
And they differ from
state to state.

54:29.299 --> 54:32.371
What do I care...
I'm dead anyway.

54:32.435 --> 54:36.110
Somebody's going
to have to dispose of you.

54:36.173 --> 54:38.881
I don't know about Wisconsin,
but Michigan's conservative.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.262
They could come after
your estate.

54:40.310 --> 54:42.017
I don't have much of an estate.

54:42.078 --> 54:43.614
Doesn't matter...
You'll still owe it.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.160
Somebody's going to be on
the hook for it.

54:46.216 --> 54:47.354
Yeah, how much?

54:47.417 --> 54:52.332
Could be as much
as 10 grand, maybe more.

54:52.389 --> 54:53.493
Wow.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.705
Oh... god.

55:01.765 --> 55:05.736
Oh, come on!

55:05.802 --> 55:07.304
Goodbye, brewers.

55:26.523 --> 55:28.127
Any damage?

55:35.599 --> 55:38.876
Ow!

55:38.935 --> 55:40.972
Ah!

55:41.037 --> 55:42.607
That's gotta hurt.

55:45.642 --> 55:48.020
Man.

55:52.949 --> 55:54.451
They wear helmets?

55:54.517 --> 55:56.087
Who?

55:56.152 --> 55:57.460
The kids, when they rollerblade.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.329
They wear helmets?

55:59.389 --> 56:00.666
I don't know...
They probably do.

56:00.690 --> 56:02.601
They wear those wrist
guard things.

56:02.659 --> 56:04.670
That's good, but you gotta
make sure they wear helmets,

56:04.694 --> 56:06.071
every single time.

56:06.129 --> 56:07.773
I mean, they're
gonna fall... it's guaranteed.

56:07.797 --> 56:08.837
What are you so hot about?

56:08.865 --> 56:10.344
If somebody told you that soon,

56:10.400 --> 56:11.970
you were gonna fall on
the concrete

56:12.035 --> 56:13.646
at 10 to 15 miles an hour,
you'd protect yourself.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.081
Right? yeah, probably
I would, yeah.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.641
Yeah, of course you would.

56:17.707 --> 56:24.090
♪

56:26.182 --> 56:29.527
Have you ever split up with
someone and both of you decide

56:29.586 --> 56:31.862
not to talk to each other
for a few weeks,

56:31.921 --> 56:34.094
you know, to kind of see
what it feels like,

56:34.157 --> 56:37.764
if you miss each other and all?

56:37.827 --> 56:40.205
Yeah.

56:40.263 --> 56:42.504
Yeah?

56:42.565 --> 56:46.172
Yeah, but not for two weeks.

56:51.007 --> 56:52.850
But I mean, you think
it's common?

56:52.909 --> 56:55.446
That people do that?

56:55.512 --> 56:57.185
I don't know.

57:05.388 --> 57:07.800
Laurie suggested that we
do that.

57:07.857 --> 57:08.892
That's not good.

57:08.958 --> 57:10.403
Yeah.

57:10.460 --> 57:13.134
Wasn't my idea.

57:13.196 --> 57:17.167
During that time, she went out
with her girlfriend.

57:17.233 --> 57:23.582
She said she met somebody
and that he was her soul mate.

57:23.640 --> 57:29.113
Then she went on a trip with
him to new york.

57:29.179 --> 57:32.956
They went
rollerblading in central park.

57:33.016 --> 57:36.725
She fell down and cracked
her head open.

57:36.786 --> 57:41.394
She died.

57:41.458 --> 57:45.099
Jeez.

57:45.161 --> 57:50.634
How long were you two together?

57:50.700 --> 57:54.944
Not long, but. I think she
might have said yes

57:55.004 --> 57:58.781
if I would have
asked her to marry me.

57:58.842 --> 58:00.480
Maybe she would have.

58:00.543 --> 58:03.922
Nobody

58:03.980 --> 58:07.427
Nobody ever
made me feel like that before.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.157
What are the chances of
that happening,

58:09.219 --> 58:10.391
meeting somebody so fast?

58:10.453 --> 58:12.433
Why didn't she just talk to me?

58:12.489 --> 58:13.490
You know?

58:13.556 --> 58:15.101
I mean, if she was feeling
something before,

58:15.125 --> 58:19.631
why wouldn't she have just...

58:19.696 --> 58:22.734
Maybe there's something that
I could have done different.

58:22.799 --> 58:24.043
Should I have done something,
should I have done more,

58:24.067 --> 58:25.205
should I have tried harder?

58:25.268 --> 58:28.044
Don't do that to yourself.

58:28.104 --> 58:29.981
Not worth it.

58:49.159 --> 58:51.435
I don't even have a picture
of her.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.354
We're sinking.
What?

59:07.410 --> 59:09.219
Look at the back of the boat.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.121
Shit.

59:10.180 --> 59:11.750
Whatever knocked off
the propeller

59:11.815 --> 59:15.092
when I ran over your plane
must have punctured the hull.

59:15.151 --> 59:18.257
Great... now we're the
Edmund-fucking-Fitzgerald.

59:18.321 --> 59:19.465
We're going to have
to shift our weight

59:19.489 --> 59:21.196
to the front of the boat.

59:36.606 --> 59:40.076
Not them?
No.

59:40.143 --> 59:43.215
What's in the bag, Kelly?

59:43.279 --> 59:45.190
Cash.

59:45.248 --> 59:46.559
I was supposed
to pick up a container

59:46.583 --> 59:49.894
at a pre-determined time
and location.

59:49.953 --> 59:52.331
What's in the container?
I don't know.

59:52.388 --> 59:54.334
You don't know...
What do you think?

59:54.390 --> 59:55.830
I know it could be one
of two things,

59:55.859 --> 59:58.237
considering it's
black market and all.

59:58.294 --> 01:00:02.902
Drugs, maybe...
Probably.

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.138
Maybe body parts.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.770
Black market body parts?

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.280
There's a shortage.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.874
Kidneys, hearts, eyeballs.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.250
People stop
filling out the donor box

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.311
on their driver's license.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.788
How much do you
charge for an eyeball?

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:19.315
I decided what my stock answer
would be if I got caught.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.885
That I was going
to an air show in Osh Kosh,

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.225
but I wasn't going to Osh Kosh.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.698
I was going to an
airport outside of Milwaukee.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:28.099
How did they get you mixed up
in all this?

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:31.502
No other pilots available.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.440
I hear about this shit...
I know what's going on.

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:38.001
Probably $125,000
in this backpack.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:42.812
$125,000 in that backpack
right there?

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:45.375
Poor choice on their part.

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.385
I want to see.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.978
The backpack's lined with
Kevlar.

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.522
You can't open it.
We'll see about that.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:53.995
No, I don't get
paid if the seal is broken.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.587
So we'll reseal it.
No, no.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.862
It's sealed electronically with
UPC or something like that.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:01.402
It's not possible.

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:02.902
You ever try
to put the plastic seal

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.735
back on a bottle of
a salad dressing?

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.502
No way to.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:09.373
You can't open it.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.912
Why not?

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.470
I want to get paid.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:23.082
(sea gull cawing)

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.498
is it true what they say, Kelly,

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.967
that up in the sky,
a ship's wake

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:38.665
is visible for up to 10 hours?

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.674
A ship?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.835
Is that what you see?

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.173
Haven't you ever been to

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.744
the museum of science
and industry in Chicago?

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:46.769
Of course.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:48.281
Who hasn't in the Midwest?

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:50.340
Remember learning that?

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.249
What?

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.123
My mom, dad and I went on
a family trip once

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.026
up in door county.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.497
I was a teenager.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.965
We were at the beach
and we all went to the water

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:07.491
at the same time.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.231
My mom and I, we went
swimming immediately.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.933
My dad didn't follow us in.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.436
She said he
was probably hanging back

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:18.606
because he was so spooked
from the year before.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.443
And not knowing, I said,

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.416
"what happened
the year before?"

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:29.253
She said that between the cold
water and a hearty wave,

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.883
he got overpowered
and for a moment,

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.485
in the lake that he loved,

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.156
he was drowning.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.824
Huh.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:41.494
And that afternoon, I went
swimming with him, alone.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:42.968
Just me and my dad.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:45.199
I helped him through his fear.

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:48.140
And all he
had to say about it was,

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:51.838
"if I ever die before
your mother,

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:55.815
when she passes,
make sure she's cremated

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.510
so she doesn't
get cold."

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.984
Hmm.

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:14.330
Jerky.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:18.634
Forgot.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:20.265
That's all I got.

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.445
Really?

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.812
Asshole holdout.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.111
Yeah.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:46.692
Joseph Lowe?

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.235
My dad.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:52.569
What?

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:56.201
Come on, Mitch, give me
the long and short of it.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:04:00.304
On second thought, just
give me the short.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:03.907
My dad typically bounced
around from job to job.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.977
The beginning of the year,

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:10.047
he found himself
running low on opportunities.

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:13.754
With my mom basically
brain-dead,

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:18.094
he was getting lonely.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.100
So he was hired to do some
general work

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:25.538
around the warehouse.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.734
I got him the job.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.107
I taught him what to do.

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:38.981
He was killed.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:53.431
His head was crushed.

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.491
Man.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.299
Your dad?

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.332
I was the one who told him to
go help out with the semi.

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.675
I should have
been the one to help.

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.976
He was not experienced enough
to do that job.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:09.642
Here...
You take this.

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:12.083
Fucking do it.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:15.452
I'd kill myself if I saw
something like that.

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.117
I can't get
the image out of my head.

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:20.957
It just plays over and over
and over again.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.497
I just keep seeing it.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:31.531
The insurance company voided his
policy on a technicality

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:35.098
They said that, um.

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:38.668
Due to his
advanced age and condition,

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.874
he wasn't suitable for the kind
of work I had him doing.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.315
Jeez, Mitch.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.477
Nobody's gonna...
The insurance company basically

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.101
confirmed the fact that
it was my fault.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.588
Nobody's gonna want to be
near you.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:52.217
You gotta talk
to someone about that.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:55.421
But you can just kill yourself.

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:58.954
We gotta get
the water out of this boat.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.262
We gotta get the water out
of this boat.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.531
Gotta get the water out.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:05.834
Come on.

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.568
We got to get you in the bow...
Come on.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.268
Get away from the water.

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.573
Come on.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:15.776
Be careful.

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.511
The water.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.523
You need a dog.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.752
Why-you got a dog?

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.795
Yeah.

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.022
What's it's name?

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.793
Joey.

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.299
What kind is he?

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:39.864
Dachshund, rescue dog...
Greatest dog in the world.

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.739
We were in the woods
a couple years ago

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:44.744
and he got shot.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.108
No.

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:50.412
Yeah... hunter
mistook him for a raccoon.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:55.047
His hips and his legs
are useless.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:59.787
One evening, I was reading
the paper in the living room

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.624
and I farted really loud.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.858
(chuckling)

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:09.301
Joey just looked at me and
wheeled himself out of the room.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:13.465
(laughing)

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:21.443
that's a good story.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:24.974
You gave him that opportunity.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:30.354
You couldn't prevent
what happened.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:34.225
Same thing
with your ex-girlfriend.

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:36.593
Couldn't prevent what happened.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:43.594
Thanks, Kelly.

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:51.036
(electronic beeping)

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.670
what, it's a bomb now?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.214
GPS tracker.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.216
They must be getting close.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:08:00.248
(grunting)

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.653
here, hold on...
Hold on.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:03.850
This cramp in my arm.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.620
Just breathe...
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:06.785
Oh, god.
Breathe.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.226
Breathe...
Take a deep breathe.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:10.662
Take a deep breath, come on.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.668
I want my wife.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.398
I want my wife.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.566
(groaning)

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.745
here.

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:34.515
How do you figure out
the shit that women do?

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:40.858
Or men for that matter?

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.292
You all right?

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.488
Kelly?

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.795
Hey!

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.529
And that name thing.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.901
You know,
where we are our names.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.907
Reflections of things.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:57.341
Okay, what about it?

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.880
High to low.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:03.144
High to low?
High to low.

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:07.153
High to low, top to bottom.

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.086
I don't understand.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:14.493
Top to bottom.

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.756
Yeah... you okay... don't
close your eyes... hey, Kelly!

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:17.996
Don't close your eyes,
all right?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.380
Can you keep
your eyes open for me?

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.182
It's not time to sleep
right now... you okay?

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.464
Balancing.
What?

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.698
Balance?

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.603
Time.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.834
The time.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.274
The time?
The time.

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:34.508
The time...
You want to know the time?

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.569
I got your watch.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:38.813
The time, the time
in Michigan is 6:17.

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:41.649
It's 6:17!

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.814
It's 6:17 at home,
okay?

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.859
Kelly, open your eyes...
Open your eyes.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.553
Come on... come on!

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:48.754
Just stop it.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.661
All right... well, just
stay with me.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.995
Just breathe, okay?

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:59.734
Anxiety will kill you.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.504
Often times I think of that
guy who got arrested

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:11.348
trying to bulldoze down
this free-standing ATM machine.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:15.082
Yeah?

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:20.218
You okay...
I don't understand.

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.421
Think of the anxiety

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.192
The stress that guy was feeling.

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:40.170
I realize...
What was I talking about?

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.238
You were talking about somebody
with an ATM machine

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.841
and stress
or anxiety or something.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.545
Oh!

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.350
You all right?
My head!

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.320
It's okay.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:50.422
Hey, it's all right, just
breath.

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:53.393
Where am I?
Just breathe.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.393
Hey!

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.190
Hold on now.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.458
Come on, breathe...
Breathe.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.931
You gotta breathe.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.468
Breathe, come on!

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:03.526
Kelly!

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.765
Kelly, you gotta breathe!

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.432
Breathe!

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:09.635
Breathe, take
a deep breath, come on!

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.698
Shit!

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.269
Come on, man.

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:13.472
Come here.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.110
All right, come on.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:20.950
Come on, you ready...
Here we go.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.990
One, two, three.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:27.460
Come on, come on.

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:29.757
One, two, three.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:32.264
Come on, man.

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:33.459
Good.

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.229
You okay?

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.794
Good.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.861
That's right.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:43.070
(phone ringing)

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.509
hello?

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:51.517
(man)
Kelly.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.520
Uh, who's this?

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.419
Is this Kelly?

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.922
I need to speak with Kelly.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.356
Can you tell me who you are?

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.025
I have been trying to reach
Kelly all day.

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.222
I understand, but I need
to know who you are.

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:04.059
Is he the one the boat with you?

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:13.802
Give us the backpack.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.603
Do you have it?

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.234
You want the backpack?

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:19.745
Fine.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.338
You want the backpack?

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.403
Take it.

9-1-1, can I help you?

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.958
Yes, hello,
is this 9-1-1?

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.428
Hello?
9-1-1, may I help you?

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.091
Hi, we're... we need emergency
assistance right away.

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:40.098
What is
the nature of the emergency?

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.532
I have a plane crash victim.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:44.503
He's in his mid-50s and he's
in convulsions.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560
Where are you located?

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.130
We're on lake Michigan.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.732
In a little boat that's sinking.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.442
You need to be more specific
about your location.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.910
I don't know... we're in
a small sinking boat.

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:53.072
We're on the lake.

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.446
I hope that's Milwaukee
over there.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.744
Okay, can you be more specific?

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.015
No, I can't be any
more specific!

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.347
We're in the middle of a lake!

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:00.944
Please try to remain calm.
Please come.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.387
Hello?

01:13:13.455 --> 01:13:14.833
All right, here's what
we're going to do.

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:15.934
Here's what we're going to do.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.301
You all right, buddy?

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.360
We're going to call Kim.

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.668
How about that...
Is she in here?

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.504
I'm going to call Kim right now.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.508
There it is.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.565
Kim.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.601

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.614

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:29.671
Kelly, where are you?

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.649
No, no, this isn't Kelly.

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:31.741
This isn't Kelly.

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.013
I have Kelly here, he's hurt.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.315
My god, it's been hours.

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:36.515
He's hurt, but he wants
to say hi to you.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.578
He can hear you.

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.991
Okay, so say hi.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.993
Okay, say hi.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.188

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.559
Kelly, did something happen?

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:44.563
Can you say hi?
(grunts)

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.724
Kelly, are you okay?

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.096
Say hi...
She can hear you.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.432
Come on now... you
hear her?

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:50.435

She heard you,
she knows you're okay.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:59.035

to be okay.
