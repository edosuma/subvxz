00:02.461 --> 00:03.856
You know what
your problem is, kid?

00:03.891 --> 00:05.687
I was in a horrible car accident?

00:05.721 --> 00:07.448
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

00:08.948 --> 00:09.914
Hey, kid.

00:09.949 --> 00:12.135
Next time, don't take a car.
Take a helicopter.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.033
You know what
your problem is, Glenn?

00:15.068 --> 00:16.955
That this kid doesn't
think helicopters are funny?

00:16.990 --> 00:18.159
Yes, that's right.

00:18.194 --> 00:20.424
Glad that everybody knows
what their problem is here.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.878
Live via satellite
from Osaka, Japan,

00:30.980 --> 00:36.431
it's "Paging Doctor Maestro"
with your host, Dr. Owen Maestro!

00:40.685 --> 00:42.852
Thank you,
and welcome to the show.

00:42.953 --> 00:44.486
I'm Doctor Owen Maestro.

00:44.587 --> 00:48.823
Does anyone here have
any questions for me, the Doctor?

00:48.890 --> 00:49.857
Yes, sir.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.559
Does this lump look like
anything to you?

00:52.626 --> 00:54.188
Uh, right here on your neck?

00:54.192 --> 00:55.595
Yeah, right there.

00:55.629 --> 00:56.762
Uh, yeah.

00:56.830 --> 00:58.597
That's, uh... that's not good.

00:58.665 --> 01:02.633
I would definitely get that looked at
by your primary care physician.

01:02.701 --> 01:03.767
Oh, okay.

01:03.835 --> 01:05.334
Any other questions?

01:05.403 --> 01:08.837
Um, does this lump look
like anything?

01:08.905 --> 01:10.865
Let's take a look.

01:11.641 --> 01:12.541
Ay, ay, ay.

01:13.643 --> 01:15.778
- Um, geez...
- Oh.

01:15.846 --> 01:19.748
Um, yeah. That's... That's something
you should get looked at.

01:19.816 --> 01:20.883
Okay.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.597
Are there
any other questions at all?

01:24.955 --> 01:26.756
Okay, is this about a lump?

01:26.857 --> 01:28.657
Yeah, no.

01:28.725 --> 01:30.692
We'll be right back,
right after this.

01:31.628 --> 01:35.597
Coming up, a hypnotist
teaches Dr. Maestro some tricks.

01:35.665 --> 01:38.432
Six, five, and you're under.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.233
And funnyman Howie Mandel

01:40.334 --> 01:43.535
talks about what it's like
to lose your mind.

01:45.371 --> 01:46.804
Attention, staff.

01:46.905 --> 01:49.872
Dr. Maestro's TV-show taping
is in progress.

01:49.940 --> 01:54.277
Please hold all live-ammunition training
until 11:00.

02:02.833 --> 02:03.920
Aah!

02:03.954 --> 02:05.488
Hey! What? Ow!

02:05.556 --> 02:07.457
Oh, the old "kidnap the clown"
routine.

02:08.359 --> 02:10.259
Oh, okay, using real guns.

02:10.328 --> 02:11.294
Nice touch.

02:11.362 --> 02:12.128
Aah!

02:12.230 --> 02:13.496
Valerie, I know it's you.

02:13.564 --> 02:15.365
Only your hands are this rough.

02:15.433 --> 02:18.235
Whoa!

02:18.302 --> 02:20.437
Okay, I'm starting to think
this is a real kidnapping,

02:20.505 --> 02:22.672
which makes it a lot less funny...
to me.

02:25.476 --> 02:27.578
Sy, any word from
the network back home?

02:27.645 --> 02:28.645
Yes, yes.

02:28.713 --> 02:29.913
We got a phone call.

02:29.981 --> 02:33.350
They said they're gonna cancel the show
if the ratings don't go up.

02:33.418 --> 02:36.186
- No big deal.
- That is a very big deal, Sy.

02:36.287 --> 02:37.754
Excuse me, Mister.

02:37.822 --> 02:39.856
Your show has never been
about ratings.

02:39.957 --> 02:42.419
It's about
an American doctor overseas,

02:42.468 --> 02:44.895
dispensing medical wisdom
via satellite.

02:44.962 --> 02:46.831
If they don't want to view
something like that,

02:46.870 --> 02:49.633
- it is their problem.
- I think that's our problem.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.568
You just let me be
the producer, okay?

02:51.636 --> 02:53.570
You be the best Dr. Maestro
you can be.

02:53.638 --> 02:57.441
Okay, but I really think we need
to figure out this ratings thing.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.845
Come on, Chief.
Come on!

03:02.780 --> 03:04.213
Oh.

03:07.484 --> 03:09.185
- Hello?
- Chief! Chief!

03:09.286 --> 03:10.887
It's Blake.
Listen, I've been kidnapped.

03:10.954 --> 03:11.888
Oh! Just kidding.

03:11.955 --> 03:13.723
I'm not here right now
to take your call.

03:13.790 --> 03:14.590
Leave me a message.

03:16.393 --> 03:19.562
Wow! You totally got me.
That was clever.

03:19.663 --> 03:21.464
Listen, super urgent message...

03:21.531 --> 03:23.332
End of message. Thank you.
Goodbye.

03:23.901 --> 03:25.168
Damn it!

03:25.235 --> 03:27.370
Hey, all, mail call!

03:27.438 --> 03:28.671
Hey!

03:28.739 --> 03:30.573
My main man, the mailman!

03:30.641 --> 03:32.275
Where's the beef, Chief?

03:33.710 --> 03:35.244
Anything for me, man?

03:35.345 --> 03:37.747
Oh, no, sorry.
Not today, Chief.

03:37.815 --> 03:40.317
- You missing home?
- Oh, yeah.

03:40.384 --> 03:42.853
I'm so homesick,
I could eat a house.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.789
It's amazing... With all this mail,
not one piece for you.

03:46.891 --> 03:47.657
See you, Chief.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.900 --> 03:58.849
Come on, Cat. Pick up!

04:08.071 --> 04:09.035
If this is Blake calling,

04:09.108 --> 04:12.103
I love you
and I would do anything for you.

04:12.138 --> 04:15.276
Kidding! If you call me,
I will totally throw away my phone.

04:15.311 --> 04:16.753
Hey-ey...

04:16.821 --> 04:18.882
No, no, no.

04:20.358 --> 04:21.624
Oh, I'm so excited

04:21.692 --> 04:23.693
to read this letter
addressed to someone else!

04:23.761 --> 04:25.795
Dear Dr. Maestro,
I love your show.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.196
I've seen every episode.

04:27.297 --> 04:30.299
Does this lump look like
anything to you?

04:35.801 --> 04:38.157
Folks, I want to do something today

04:38.192 --> 04:40.476
that we've never done
on the show before.

04:40.544 --> 04:44.147
Every one of you is gonna get
a very special gift!

04:49.920 --> 04:51.187
Really?

04:51.255 --> 04:51.888
Okay.

04:51.956 --> 04:53.590
I'm sorry I brought that up.

04:53.658 --> 04:55.258
We don't have gifts for you.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.761
What I'm going to do instead
of giving away gifts

04:58.837 --> 05:00.830
is take some calls.

05:01.098 --> 05:02.565
Caller number one,
are you there?

05:02.666 --> 05:06.371
Yeah, hi.
Does this lump look like anything?

05:06.406 --> 05:08.230
You people with your lumps.

05:08.265 --> 05:10.273
Time of death... 2:40.

05:11.483 --> 05:12.996
Don't you mean "too farty?"

05:14.599 --> 05:16.178
I put a speaker on there.
Listen to this.

05:18.449 --> 05:19.582
Fartcopter.

05:22.118 --> 05:24.186
Hey, Fartcopter, you had
too much Mexican food!

05:26.258 --> 05:27.747
Okay, next caller.

05:27.782 --> 05:29.792
Owen! Oh, thank God!

05:29.860 --> 05:31.461
What, is everybody in surgery
or something?

05:31.529 --> 05:34.029
No one has been picking up
their phone... No one!

05:34.064 --> 05:36.233
Blake, what are you doing calling
in the middle of my show?

05:36.300 --> 05:37.733
All right, listen.

05:37.835 --> 05:39.301
I've been kidnapped.

05:39.369 --> 05:40.269
I escaped.

05:40.370 --> 05:41.303
What?!

05:41.371 --> 05:43.138
But I'm hiding.

05:43.206 --> 05:46.208
They're gonna find me, Owen.
And they're gonna find me.

05:46.276 --> 05:48.357
Okay, Blake, listen to me.

05:48.392 --> 05:50.646
I'm gonna record this
on my tiny tape recorder.

05:50.713 --> 05:53.348
Leave your phone
underneath the bed.

05:53.416 --> 05:57.286
You're gonna have three,
maybe four seconds to shout out

05:57.353 --> 06:00.127
specific details about these people.

06:01.549 --> 06:03.165
Do you understand?

06:08.822 --> 06:11.145
Oh, they left.
It's totally cool.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.201
So sorry to bug you
during your show, man.

06:14.938 --> 06:18.071
Oh, there's three men!
They're all wearing shirts!

06:18.106 --> 06:20.342
Of course, they're wearing shirts!
Everyone wears a shirt!

06:20.409 --> 06:22.677
One of them is blue.
Look for a guy with a blue...

06:22.745 --> 06:24.432
No, no, no! Wait! Green!

06:24.467 --> 06:26.846
What do you mean?!
Like a sea foam or a sky blue?

06:26.881 --> 06:28.549
Teal!
It's like a light blue!

06:29.818 --> 06:32.520
Blake? Blake!

06:32.555 --> 06:35.459
What do you call it when
a color is like a softer tone?

06:35.542 --> 06:37.666
Oh, oh! It's... it's pastel!

06:37.701 --> 06:39.461
It's pastel!

06:39.496 --> 06:41.157
Owen!

06:41.330 --> 06:43.081
Hello?

06:46.023 --> 06:47.103
Hello?

06:48.546 --> 06:49.503
Okay, you listen to me.

06:49.571 --> 06:51.539
I don't know who you are,

06:51.640 --> 06:53.308
and I don't know what you want.

06:53.375 --> 06:57.445
If you're looking for ransom,
I can tell you I don't have money,

06:57.512 --> 07:02.483
but what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.319
Offer money.

07:04.354 --> 07:06.991
No, forget that.
I do have money, okay?

07:07.026 --> 07:09.056
I have a lot of money.
I'm a doctor on TV.

07:09.124 --> 07:12.409
But if you want some of this money,
you got to give me something,

07:12.444 --> 07:13.940
something that I can use,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.764
something like... I don't know...
horseback-riding lessons

07:16.831 --> 07:17.965
or, like, a jet ski.

07:18.733 --> 07:21.501
- The clown.
- No, forget that!

07:21.569 --> 07:25.003
I'll give you the money,
you give me the clown.

07:25.104 --> 07:26.572
How does that sound?

07:26.639 --> 07:29.841
We'll be in touch.

07:29.909 --> 07:31.943
Sy, we're going after Blake.

07:32.045 --> 07:33.011
Get a camera.

07:33.112 --> 07:34.445
I'm ready!

07:35.547 --> 07:38.449
What do you call it when
a color is like a softer tone?

07:38.517 --> 07:40.952
Where are they hiding you, Blake?

07:41.019 --> 07:42.909
Where?

07:44.523 --> 07:46.124
Dear Sy Mittleman,

07:46.192 --> 07:48.648
if you ever want
to see the clown again,

07:48.683 --> 07:52.531
leave a million dollars
in a briefcase on pier 7

07:52.632 --> 07:55.066
next to the Osaka Riverside Hotel.

07:57.003 --> 07:57.770
Yello?

07:57.838 --> 07:59.605
Sy, Blake's been kidnapped!

07:59.673 --> 08:00.539
No Sherlock!

08:00.640 --> 08:02.708
No, Sy. It's Chief!

08:02.775 --> 08:04.344
Hi, Chief.

08:04.379 --> 08:06.817
Wow, do you sound
like my best friend, Sherlock.

08:06.852 --> 08:07.908
Oh, you don't say?

08:07.943 --> 08:10.149
Ask her if she knows any kidnappers
that wear pastels.

08:10.217 --> 08:12.384
Sy, they want to make
a drop at the Riverside Hotel.

08:12.485 --> 08:13.485
Riverside?

08:13.586 --> 08:16.721
We're headed in the opposite
direction completely.

08:16.789 --> 08:17.922
Bye-bye!

08:18.824 --> 08:19.791
Riverside?

08:19.859 --> 08:21.125
There's a couple Russian dudes

08:21.193 --> 08:24.729
that hold a bimonthly sex-slave
auction right near there.

08:24.797 --> 08:28.033
Sy, looks like we're going
to a sex-slave auction.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.768
Second time this month.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.097
Hey, man!

08:53.725 --> 08:55.826
I am so sorry, sir.

08:56.241 --> 08:59.209
Our next item is a healthy,
male clown.

08:59.598 --> 09:01.566
Which one of you guys
gave me the heroin?

09:01.871 --> 09:04.485
Particularly feminine hips
on this one.

09:05.540 --> 09:08.756
We'll start the bidding
at 4,000 yen.

09:09.017 --> 09:12.767
Only thing bad about heroin
is the puking.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.167
Other than that, a-okay!

09:15.202 --> 09:16.978
All right, you perverts!

09:17.046 --> 09:18.513
Nobody move!

09:20.915 --> 09:23.549
Oh, oh, oh.

09:23.617 --> 09:26.385
Didn't think you guys
would have guns, too.

09:26.953 --> 09:28.876
Okay, I surrender.

09:28.911 --> 09:31.490
My hands are going up.
Look at my hands.

09:31.591 --> 09:33.826
I'm counting down from seven,

09:33.893 --> 09:37.029
six, five, and you're under.

09:39.099 --> 09:41.263
Whew. That worked.

09:41.298 --> 09:42.436
Blake! Wake up!

09:42.471 --> 09:43.436
Come on.
I'm getting you out of here.

09:43.504 --> 09:45.067
- We don't have much time.
- Do you have any heroin?

09:45.086 --> 09:46.550
I'll see you later, boys.

09:52.746 --> 09:55.346
Folks, as you just saw on live TV,

09:55.381 --> 09:58.752
I just rescued my friend
Dr. Blake Downs!

09:59.902 --> 10:01.140
Have a seat.

10:01.175 --> 10:02.551
I'm on a lot of heroin
right now.

10:02.586 --> 10:03.746
I know you are, buddy.

10:03.781 --> 10:04.824
You're gonna pick us up
for another year?

10:04.892 --> 10:06.459
So, let's get back into it.

10:13.084 --> 10:15.298
Is this what you like?!
Fartcopter?!

10:18.254 --> 10:21.470
Scratch that, Mike.
Have I got a show for you.

10:21.505 --> 10:24.299
You want me
and Fartcopter every week?

10:26.127 --> 10:28.980
How about... just Fartcopter?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.679
Farts are funny.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.786
Coming up on this season
of "Fartcopter"...

10:37.853 --> 10:41.470
The nation's capital gets a dose
of copter farts.

10:42.023 --> 10:44.857
Fartcopter reviews
the new Tyler Perry movie.

10:45.792 --> 10:50.028
Endangered animals...
endangered of copter farts.

10:51.130 --> 10:55.033
And kids seem to be falling in love
with Fartcopter.
