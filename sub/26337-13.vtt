A three-Michelin star chefdoesn't even know what the fuck

02:54.760 --> 02:57.832
It's a true blessing,
true blessing.

02:57.936 --> 02:59.731
You know, growing up in theneighborhood I lived in,

02:59.834 --> 03:01.042
I became a product of it.

03:01.146 --> 03:02.872
So never in a
million years would

03:02.975 --> 03:05.806
I have ever thought that
I'll be here right now.

03:05.909 --> 03:07.842
Like shit and change, you know?

03:07.946 --> 03:10.535
When I was 20 years old, I wasa product of my environment.

Imagine sitting in a courtroom.

03:13.572 --> 03:15.816
And the judge tells you,

03:15.919 --> 03:18.405
looking at 30 years in prison.

03:18.508 --> 03:19.716
Oh my God.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.408
At 20 years old.

03:21.511 --> 03:23.306
To be out here,
have the opportunity

03:23.410 --> 03:26.033
to cook next to and
for Chef Ramsay, all

03:26.136 --> 03:29.105
because of food, yo, food, man.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.762
Food.

03:30.865 --> 03:32.798
So this means the world to me.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.766
And I ain't gonna stop, man.

03:34.869 --> 03:36.181
I just try and take
one day at a time.

03:36.285 --> 03:38.148
You know, I got a
beautiful daughter.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.842

03:41.945 --> 03:43.015
So it's all right.

03:43.119 --> 03:45.708
You sentimental guy.

03:45.811 --> 03:48.400
It's good, yo.

03:48.504 --> 03:50.885
[music playing]

04:28.268 --> 04:29.959
I'm not even hungry.

04:30.062 --> 04:30.856
Yeah, me either.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.583
I'm not eating today.

04:33.687 --> 04:35.309
Good morning, chefs.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.759
Good morning.

04:36.862 --> 04:38.139
Gosh, what is this?

04:38.243 --> 04:40.590
Chef Ramsay has made
you some breakfast.

04:40.694 --> 04:42.074
Holy cow.

04:42.178 --> 04:43.835
Jack is getting VIP treatment.

04:43.938 --> 04:44.905
Is this real right now?

04:45.008 --> 04:45.871
It is.

04:45.975 --> 04:48.115
Yo, man, breakfast
in the dorm.

04:49.392 --> 04:50.428
Wow.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.601
Welcome to black jackets.

04:51.705 --> 04:52.533
Enjoy.

04:52.637 --> 04:53.845
We'll see you in a bit.

04:53.948 --> 04:56.399
Man, we got a spicy tomatodish with some baked eggs

04:56.503 --> 04:57.331
on top.

04:57.435 --> 04:59.506
There is an eggs
Benedict up there.

04:59.609 --> 05:02.750
Eggs are ridiculous.

05:02.854 --> 05:04.683
It's just a beautiful
spread of perfectly

05:04.787 --> 05:06.064
executed breakfast.

05:06.167 --> 05:07.237
I wonder what he
does to the eggs?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.135
I don't know.

05:08.238 --> 05:09.136
Look at them, though, right?

05:09.239 --> 05:10.310
Yeah.

05:10.413 --> 05:13.002
Although it's beenquite lovely this morning.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.314
Peppers, onions.

05:14.417 --> 05:17.109
I'm pretty sure that I
need to pay attention.

05:17.213 --> 05:20.803
So I've mentally logged allthe dishes and presentation,

05:20.906 --> 05:23.702
because everything happens fora reason here in Hell's Kitchen.

05:23.806 --> 05:26.153
Did you get a mental
note of all of this?

05:26.256 --> 05:27.534
I think so.

05:27.637 --> 05:29.950
Did you notice that it's twodifferent types of mayonnaise?

05:30.053 --> 05:31.089
One was ham.

05:31.192 --> 05:32.504
I didn't see the other one.

05:32.608 --> 05:34.886
Did they both have
bacon on top of them?

05:34.989 --> 05:36.059
I think it's prosciutto.

05:36.163 --> 05:37.958
[phone ringing]

05:38.061 --> 05:38.993
This is Mia.

05:39.097 --> 05:41.202
Good morning,
black jacket brigade.

05:41.306 --> 05:43.066
I need to see everythingdown through the blue kitchen

05:43.170 --> 05:44.827
in the dining room
urgently, please.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.725
Heard that, chef, thank you.

05:46.829 --> 05:49.210
Blue kitchen everyone.

05:49.314 --> 05:52.006
It's nice to have family mealand all that kind of stuff.

05:52.110 --> 05:55.320
But you have to be on yourtoes in Hell's Kitchen.

05:55.424 --> 05:56.735
I have 12 toes.

05:56.839 --> 06:00.670
And that's not enough to keepme up around here all the time.

06:00.774 --> 06:01.568
Good morning.

06:01.671 --> 06:03.293
Good morning, chef.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.778
Heather that was a close one.

06:04.881 --> 06:05.710
Too close.

06:05.813 --> 06:06.918
You're absolutely right.

06:07.021 --> 06:08.851
You've been in this
situation before.

06:08.954 --> 06:11.094
What's different
now to last time?

06:11.198 --> 06:13.027
Well, I don't remember
getting breakfast.

06:13.131 --> 06:14.650
So thank you, chef.

06:14.753 --> 06:15.651
Thank you so much, chef.

06:15.754 --> 06:16.997
Great.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.861
Mia, did you get a chance todig in and eat everything?

06:18.964 --> 06:21.104
Yes, I always like a
runny egg with bread.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.416
Good.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.245
Bread, did you taste
all those dishes?

06:24.349 --> 06:25.143
I did.

06:25.246 --> 06:26.144
Yes, chef.

06:26.247 --> 06:27.317
That's good to
hear, because right

06:27.421 --> 06:30.528
now, it's the challenge
that separates

06:30.631 --> 06:32.806
the chefs from the cooks.

06:32.909 --> 06:33.772
That's right.

06:33.876 --> 06:37.673
It's taste it, now make it.

06:37.776 --> 06:38.639
Oh, shit.

06:38.743 --> 06:39.744
I was just eating.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.504
I wasn't thinking we
gonna have to make it.

06:41.608 --> 06:44.369
You know I got ADDDDD as it is.

06:44.473 --> 06:46.682
So I'll do the best I can.

06:46.785 --> 06:49.339
Christina, please?

06:49.443 --> 06:50.202
Good morning, chefs.

06:50.306 --> 06:51.445
Good morning.

06:51.549 --> 06:53.654
That stunning eggs Benedictis the breakfast dish

06:53.758 --> 06:56.174
that I'd like all five
of you to recreate.

06:56.277 --> 06:58.418
The chef who is
the most successful

06:58.521 --> 07:02.629
with the presentation andtaste wins the challenge.

07:02.732 --> 07:06.702
Your 30 minutes start now.

07:10.188 --> 07:13.018
The other four chefs just kindof dive back into that plate,

07:13.122 --> 07:14.744
and start tasting things over.

07:14.848 --> 07:16.159
And I'm feeling
confident right now.

07:16.263 --> 07:18.541
So I'm going to go from
memory at this point.

07:18.645 --> 07:19.956
You've got a handle on this?

07:20.060 --> 07:20.957
Tasted it this morning, chef.

07:21.061 --> 07:21.889
Yeah?

07:21.993 --> 07:22.890
You paid attention then, huh?

07:22.994 --> 07:24.996
Yes, chef, always.

07:25.099 --> 07:26.860
I feel like there
was a lot of things

07:26.963 --> 07:28.275
thrown in here to
make sure we were

07:28.378 --> 07:30.242
paying attention to detail.

07:30.346 --> 07:32.590
So I'm feeling like
the first Benedict

07:32.693 --> 07:34.315
is for sure Canadian bacon.

07:34.419 --> 07:37.180
And the other one
looks like prosciutto.

07:37.284 --> 07:38.941
NARRATOR: Crafty
veteran Ariel has

07:39.044 --> 07:41.288
decided that Chef
Ramsay's eggs Benedict

07:41.391 --> 07:43.773
dish has two different meats.

07:43.877 --> 07:47.915
And Brett, Heather, andMia are all in agreement.

07:48.019 --> 07:50.262
While rookie Matta
has decided to use

07:50.366 --> 07:53.058
prosciutto on both Benedict's.

07:53.162 --> 07:55.440
You confident with
making a hollandaise?

07:55.544 --> 07:57.477
I know how to
make eggs Benedict.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.824
I know I can
recreate this easily.

07:59.927 --> 08:03.724
But the only thing that I'mnot sure of in the sauce

08:03.828 --> 08:05.208
is the spice.

08:05.312 --> 08:07.245
It tastes like a
traditional hollandaise.

08:07.348 --> 08:08.695
But it's red.

08:08.798 --> 08:14.804
So I made a reduction withshallot and escalate powder.

08:14.908 --> 08:16.254
NARRATOR: Matta
is using red wine

08:16.357 --> 08:18.808
vinegar and shallots
as Chef Ramsay's

08:18.912 --> 08:21.328
secret hollandaise ingredients.

08:21.431 --> 08:25.470
Ariel and Heather are
both only using paprika.

08:25.574 --> 08:26.713
Somebody got all the chives?

08:26.816 --> 08:28.369
I got some more,
if you need them.

08:28.473 --> 08:31.338
NARRATOR: While Brettdecides to go with chives.

08:31.441 --> 08:32.235
Four minutes, guys.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.133
Yes, chef.

08:42.901 --> 08:44.420
I go to use my hollandaise.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.320
And it kind of looks likereally thin cottage cheese.

08:48.424 --> 08:49.218
Oh my God.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.219
This is not happening.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.084
15 seconds to go.

08:53.187 --> 08:54.016
Fuck.

08:54.119 --> 08:56.156
This is going downhill for me.

08:56.259 --> 08:57.088
My yolk broke.

08:57.191 --> 08:58.883
My Hollandaise just broke.

08:58.986 --> 09:01.506
I have no idea what I've
done to the food gods.

09:01.610 --> 09:03.853
But the karma they'regiving me back is not nice.

09:03.957 --> 09:06.511
Finishing touches.

09:06.615 --> 09:17.211
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, and plates.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.109
Well done.

09:22.251 --> 09:26.220
I hope that your
palates served you well.

09:26.324 --> 09:27.981
Matta, please slide down.

09:28.084 --> 09:29.672
Thank you.

09:29.776 --> 09:32.019
Matta's looks OK.

09:32.123 --> 09:36.679
But it definitely doesn'tlook the way that mine looks.

09:36.783 --> 09:39.164
Describe your dish, please.

09:39.268 --> 09:41.891
Eggs Benedict, not
as good as yours, chef.

09:41.995 --> 09:45.170
But I have the Englishmuffin, and the crusted bread.

09:45.274 --> 09:46.724
What's the protein?

09:46.827 --> 09:49.105
I did prosciutto, chef.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.555
Interesting.

09:50.659 --> 09:53.144
Then I have a shallot red winevinegar reduction hollandaise.

09:53.247 --> 09:55.698
Wow, great.

09:55.802 --> 09:58.045
Thank you.

09:58.149 --> 10:00.530
Heather, describe your dish.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.049
I have the English muffin.

10:02.153 --> 10:04.224
I used Canadian bacon.

10:04.327 --> 10:06.813
What happened to
your hollandaise

10:06.916 --> 10:08.884
and your poached eggs?

10:08.987 --> 10:10.195
Heather.

10:10.299 --> 10:11.507
I know, chef.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.372
Even if they're not exactlylike Chef Ramsay's dish,

10:14.475 --> 10:16.926
if you can't at least justput up a nicely poached egg

10:17.030 --> 10:18.963
and a nicely made
hollandaise, then we

10:19.066 --> 10:21.241
have deeper issues here.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.967
Wow.

10:23.070 --> 10:23.864
Look at that dish.

10:23.968 --> 10:25.728
I don't feel that it's you.

10:25.832 --> 10:27.005
It's not.

10:27.109 --> 10:28.869
OK, interesting indeed.

10:31.596 --> 10:34.185
I'm so over this
fucking challenge today.

10:34.288 --> 10:35.911
It's not even funny

10:36.014 --> 10:37.222
OK, Brett, come down, please.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.572
What happened?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.955
I fucked up royally
on this one, chef.

10:46.059 --> 10:47.370
Well, I'm not
going to eat that.

10:59.313 --> 11:00.452

Chef Ramsay with a disaster.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.158
Yes, my hollandaise broke.

11:16.261 --> 11:17.746
The protein is the
Canadian bacon.

11:17.849 --> 11:19.333
I used the English muffin.

11:19.437 --> 11:21.715
OK, what a shame
your hollandaise.

11:21.819 --> 11:22.612
Thank you.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.028
Yes, chef.

11:24.131 --> 11:25.270
I'm not going to
win this challenge.

11:25.374 --> 11:26.409
But I'll never crack.

11:26.513 --> 11:28.688
I have to just
bounce the fuck back.

11:28.791 --> 11:29.758
Aerial, slide down, please.

11:29.861 --> 11:31.000

11:31.104 --> 11:32.692

11:33.693 --> 11:34.728

11:34.832 --> 11:37.869

Mia, please.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.226
Thank you.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.228
My first job out
of culinary school

11:52.332 --> 11:55.749
was at Bhushan doing
breakfast and brunch.

11:55.853 --> 11:59.511
And I may have made 300
Benedict's in one day.

11:59.615 --> 12:01.617
I totally have this.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.964
So on the English muffin
I have Canadian bacon.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.414
Tell me about the
base of the hollandaise.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.519
How come it's looking so rich?

12:07.623 --> 12:11.247
I did a reduction ofwhite wine vinegar, shallot,

12:11.351 --> 12:12.455
with espelate.

12:12.559 --> 12:16.390
Right, wow, Thank you.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.392
OK, let's break this down.

12:18.496 --> 12:20.947
For the hollandaise,
So you can not--

12:21.050 --> 12:24.191
Brett and Heather-- servea broken hollandaise.

12:24.295 --> 12:25.089
Understood?

12:25.192 --> 12:26.021
Yes, chef.

12:26.124 --> 12:27.263
You two are out.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.164
We're wearing
black jackets now.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.475

12:32.579 --> 12:34.512
So Brett and Heather, yougot to take this seriously.

12:34.615 --> 12:36.272
Where is that
attention to detail?

12:36.376 --> 12:37.411
Rest of you listen up.

12:37.515 --> 12:40.000
Two of you used Canadian
bacon and prosciutto.

12:40.104 --> 12:43.176
One of you used only prosciutto.

12:43.279 --> 12:46.006
That, Matta, was incorrect.

12:46.110 --> 12:50.459
That leaves Mia and Aerial.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.462
You both seasoned it
completely different.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.429
Mia, you had the shallots.

12:55.533 --> 12:56.534
Yes, chef.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.225
And Aerial, you said
you seasoned yours

12:58.329 --> 13:00.089

13:22.456 --> 13:25.943
This is one of the most covetedtitles in Hell's Kitchen,

13:26.046 --> 13:29.325
and an awesome way to
start black jackets.

13:29.429 --> 13:31.949
I got to know, chef, whatis in that hollandaise?

13:32.052 --> 13:32.915
Listen.

13:33.019 --> 13:35.400
There was shallots
in the reduction.

13:35.504 --> 13:36.643
- There was, OK.
- Congratulations.

13:36.746 --> 13:37.540
Thank you, chef.

13:37.644 --> 13:39.508
However, there was paprika.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.681
OK.

13:40.785 --> 13:42.856
The fact that you got
that depth and darkness

13:42.960 --> 13:45.825
in that hollandaise,
and you got the shallots

13:45.928 --> 13:48.966

13:50.346 --> 13:53.971
I always get to have fun,because I keep on winning.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.938
I do have a question
for both of you.

13:56.042 --> 13:58.320
Are yo afraid of heights?

13:59.321 --> 14:00.598
A little bit.

14:00.701 --> 14:02.634
Have you ever been in a singleengine plane with no door?

14:02.738 --> 14:03.532
Oh, Jesus.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.017
Fuck me.

14:06.121 --> 14:09.572
Have you ever been skydiving?

14:09.676 --> 14:10.608

14:19.720 --> 14:21.205

14:21.308 --> 14:23.207
I just had a heart attack.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.794
Phew, OK.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.004
You are going to have
a blast, both of you.

14:27.107 --> 14:28.833
Christina, why are you smiling?

14:28.937 --> 14:29.765
It sounds awesome.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.662
Would you like to go?

14:30.766 --> 14:31.594
Can you come with us?

14:31.698 --> 14:32.492

Thank you chef.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.782
Well done.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.197
Brett, Heather, Matta.

14:48.301 --> 14:49.302
Yes, chef?

14:49.405 --> 14:50.441
The three of you
are going to be really

14:50.544 --> 14:51.821
miserable, because
today in Hell's Kitchen

14:51.925 --> 14:57.551
is dorm cleaning day.

14:57.655 --> 15:00.969
You'll be sweeping,
dusting, cleaning,

15:01.072 --> 15:04.834
vacuuming, polishing the dorms.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.389
I want those dorms spotless.

15:07.492 --> 15:08.528
Heard, chef.

15:08.631 --> 15:10.150
Cleaning supplies will
be arriving shortly.

15:10.254 --> 15:11.048
Let's go.

15:11.151 --> 15:11.911
Yes, chef.

15:17.295 --> 15:19.884
It's not horrible.

15:19.988 --> 15:20.920
You're a mom.

15:21.023 --> 15:22.852
You probably clean
the house every day.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.682
Plus, my son can't aim
in the fucking toilet

15:24.785 --> 15:25.579
to save his life.

15:25.683 --> 15:26.477
So.

15:30.032 --> 15:33.035
Taste it now make it.

15:33.139 --> 15:35.382
Eggs Benedict.

15:35.486 --> 15:38.351
Fuck, man, my
hollandaise was garbage.

15:38.454 --> 15:39.835
Yeah, mine broke right
at the last minute.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.734
It was nice until I
fucked with it again.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.598
First black jacket
challenge in the books.

15:44.702 --> 15:47.118
And I feel like I'm
letting myself down.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.395
And I hate that feeling.

15:48.499 --> 15:52.123
Out of the five people stillhere, I was a runner up.

15:52.227 --> 15:54.194
I had my hand on that door.

15:54.298 --> 15:55.506
I know what it takes.

15:55.609 --> 15:57.680
And I need to just
put my head down

15:57.784 --> 15:58.992
and cook my fucking heart out.

15:59.096 --> 16:00.304
That's what I need to do.

16:00.407 --> 16:01.615
We all beasts in the kitchen.

16:01.719 --> 16:03.307
That's why we here still,you know what I'm saying?

16:03.410 --> 16:04.446
So.

16:04.549 --> 16:06.034
I say we execute a
flawless dinner service,

16:06.137 --> 16:08.001
and make it very hardfor one of us to go home.

16:15.146 --> 16:16.630
You ready, goose?

16:16.734 --> 16:19.357
Ready to go.

16:19.461 --> 16:22.084
Yes, we're going skydiving!

16:22.188 --> 16:23.948
I like adrenaline.

16:24.052 --> 16:25.191
This kind of thing is fun.

16:25.294 --> 16:27.296
Let's do this.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.401
You look fabulous, Mia.

16:28.504 --> 16:29.367
Thank you.

16:33.406 --> 16:35.856
Mia is like a fearless
little firecracker.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.136
Oh my God!

16:39.239 --> 16:40.585
She looks so tiny in there.

16:40.689 --> 16:43.036
It's adorable.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.417
I just like
having a good time.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.591
I feel like this kind
of thing is really fun.

16:46.695 --> 16:48.766
I'm just going up anddown with the instructor.

16:48.869 --> 16:52.632
I was like, yeah!

16:52.735 --> 16:53.598
Holy shit!

17:01.537 --> 17:03.988
I'm just looking atthis big tunnel thinking,

17:04.092 --> 17:06.232
don't make a fool yourself.

17:06.335 --> 17:07.612
Don't freak out.

17:07.716 --> 17:08.510
Act cool.

17:08.613 --> 17:09.407
It's going to be OK.

17:16.138 --> 17:20.039
All I can feel is my stomachjust like going into my chest.

17:20.142 --> 17:21.971
And I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

17:30.635 --> 17:33.362
I think that I might be ableto eventually work my way up

17:33.466 --> 17:34.812
to jumping out of an airplane.

17:34.915 --> 17:36.745
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

17:44.235 --> 17:47.687
It kind of looks likeChef Jockey has pigtails.

17:47.790 --> 17:48.929
I don't know how I'm
going to take him

17:49.033 --> 17:51.035
seriously in the
kitchen now when I think

17:51.139 --> 17:53.348
about how he looked today.

17:53.451 --> 17:54.901
Amazing.

17:55.004 --> 17:55.833
Amazing, huh?

18:04.221 --> 18:08.742
Cleaning the dorms,[humming] cleaning the dorms--

18:08.846 --> 18:09.743
uh-oh, oh shit.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.472
I feel like I'm
back at home, cleaning

18:14.576 --> 18:17.096
up after my five-year-old son.

18:17.199 --> 18:18.511
People are gross.

18:18.614 --> 18:19.408
Ew.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.728
Boom, shipwreck.

18:28.831 --> 18:31.593
We on our hands and knees,feel like Cinderella and shit,

18:31.696 --> 18:34.803
scrubbing, and wiping, anddusting, and yaba-daba-doing.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.667
It's a big ass
house to be cleaning.

18:36.770 --> 18:38.669
I got a one bedroom apartment.

18:38.772 --> 18:40.912
And I still pay
somebody to do it, yo.

18:45.779 --> 18:47.712
There was some shit pushed tothe back of that refrigerator.

18:47.816 --> 18:48.679
It was disgusting.

18:48.782 --> 18:49.611
Really?

18:49.714 --> 18:52.683
They smelled so bad.

18:52.786 --> 18:55.513
A lot of fucking chia pudding.

18:55.617 --> 18:56.721
We know who that's is.

18:56.825 --> 18:57.619
Mia.

18:57.722 --> 18:58.654
Oh yeah.

18:58.758 --> 18:59.724
Have you worked with her yet?- Nope.

18:59.828 --> 19:00.898
In the kitchen?

19:01.001 --> 19:01.864
Nope.

19:01.968 --> 19:06.248
let me tell you,
she can bang solo.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.456
That's what I keep hearing.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.977
Mia is very good as
an independent chef.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.222
She can cook in a
challenge flawlessly.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.327
But when she has to
answer to anybody,

19:16.431 --> 19:19.951
and she has to try to work asa team, she fails miserably.

19:20.055 --> 19:22.402
Her OCD will drive you
up the fucking wall.

19:22.506 --> 19:24.128
For real, right?

19:24.232 --> 19:25.025
NARRATOR: Coming up.

19:25.129 --> 19:26.406
You need to listen to me.

19:26.510 --> 19:27.787
I apologize.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.583
NARRATOR: It may be the firstdinner service as one team.

19:30.686 --> 19:32.309
There's two of you on there.

19:32.412 --> 19:33.344
You need to talk.

19:33.448 --> 19:34.242
Please, do not talk to me.

19:34.345 --> 19:35.243
I'm not.

19:35.346 --> 19:36.692
NARRATOR: But does
one veteran chef.

19:36.796 --> 19:38.280
Don't put your fucking
head down like that.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.247
I told you start talking.

19:39.350 --> 19:40.282
Fucking do it.

19:40.386 --> 19:42.767
NARRATOR: Have their
own sneaky agenda.

19:42.871 --> 19:43.665
That's it!

19:49.843 --> 19:50.982
I've been dying to ask you.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.950
What was it like when yougot your black jacket?

19:53.053 --> 19:55.573
Black jacket, that
was such a great night.

19:55.677 --> 19:56.781
First of all, great service.

19:56.885 --> 19:58.093
Thank you, chef.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.717
There's no greater way tocelebrate a unique service

20:01.821 --> 20:03.271
than putting on a black jacket.

20:03.374 --> 20:05.065
[cheering]

20:06.515 --> 20:08.793
Thank you, chef.

20:08.897 --> 20:10.761
Oh [beep]!

20:10.864 --> 20:12.797
But now you guys are
down to one kitchen.

20:12.901 --> 20:14.558
You got to learn
to work together.

20:14.661 --> 20:19.942
And the expectation has justjumped from here to here.

20:20.046 --> 20:21.392
You've been in
this position before.

20:21.496 --> 20:22.290
I have.

20:22.393 --> 20:24.188
But like I said,
for some reason,

20:24.292 --> 20:27.640
last time, I feel like I wasn'tin it as much as I am now.

20:27.743 --> 20:29.297
Like yesterday, when
I'm standing there,

20:29.400 --> 20:30.953
I was like, I don't want
just a black jacket.

20:31.057 --> 20:32.265
I want the first black jacket.

20:32.369 --> 20:33.162
Give it to me.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.337
I want the first one.

20:35.441 --> 20:37.788
Ariel is my biggest
competition right now.

20:37.891 --> 20:38.720
I admire her.

20:38.823 --> 20:40.169
I think she's a great chef.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.827
And facing her in the
finale and beating her

20:42.931 --> 20:44.933
would be unbelievable.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.591
This is something that
I really, really want,

20:47.694 --> 20:50.870
and that I feel like
I can touch already.

20:50.973 --> 20:53.252
When the rookies werebeating us left and right,

20:53.355 --> 20:55.012
I was getting pissed.

20:55.115 --> 20:58.118
I was like, oh, so this is howthis season is going to go.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.810
And then the rookies
came to your team.

20:59.913 --> 21:01.018
And you started winning.

21:01.121 --> 21:03.710
Oh!

21:03.814 --> 21:05.540
I feel like I
helped Mia throughout

21:05.643 --> 21:06.851
this whole competition.

21:06.955 --> 21:09.268
But the mentorship
program is over.

21:09.371 --> 21:10.338
I'm sorry.

21:10.441 --> 21:12.201
It's time for us to
shine individually.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.169
As I say, nothing youcan't hate anything though.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.066
No.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.033
Everything's now exposed.

21:23.765 --> 21:25.214
So do we have a
list of what we need?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.493
What else do we need besidesblack pepper and candy pecans?

21:27.596 --> 21:28.666
We need dessert
plate, I think.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.185
- I got them right here.
- OK.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.704
Canal spoons, did you find?- Yeah.

21:31.807 --> 21:32.705
OK.

21:32.808 --> 21:33.568
I pay attention.

21:33.671 --> 21:34.914
Trust me.

21:35.017 --> 21:36.122
Coconut-- yeah, coconut.

21:36.225 --> 21:37.641
It's already in.

21:37.744 --> 21:39.332
It's under here.

21:39.436 --> 21:41.092
OK, cool.

21:41.196 --> 21:42.508
Yeah, OK.

21:42.611 --> 21:44.061
The fryer's on right?
- Yeah.

21:44.164 --> 21:44.958
Yeah, everything's on.

21:45.062 --> 21:45.959
OK.

21:46.063 --> 21:47.306
And then maybe more
chopped pecans,

21:47.409 --> 21:48.203
just plain chopped pecans.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.894
I don't know if that's enough.

21:49.998 --> 21:51.033
Just a little bit more.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.035
Mia, we're all
in a black jacket.

21:53.139 --> 21:55.728
You are no better than
anybody at this point.

21:55.831 --> 21:56.970
Pipe down.

21:57.074 --> 21:59.007
Heather, if you're justworking on that right now,

21:59.110 --> 22:00.491
you want to lay
out the carpaccio?

22:00.595 --> 22:01.389
I'll show you.

22:01.492 --> 22:04.012
I'm ready to fucking kill her.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.462
I am just not
getting caught up

22:05.565 --> 22:08.050
in this whole too manychiefs tonight situation,

22:08.154 --> 22:09.983
or we're fucked.

22:10.087 --> 22:11.640

22:13.918 --> 22:17.059
Can we get vocal, straight,simple answers, yes, no?

22:17.163 --> 22:19.510
Communicate before the problem.

22:19.614 --> 22:21.167
The earlier you tell
me, and the earlier

22:21.270 --> 22:24.239
we tell each other, the morewe can do something about it.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.723
That's understood now, right?- Yes, chef.

22:25.827 --> 22:26.621
Let's go.

27:18.153 --> 27:19.568

27:19.672 --> 27:21.294
But if Brett can just
be a little bit more

27:21.398 --> 27:23.814
vocal as to what help heneeds, than I can get in there

27:23.918 --> 27:25.160

30:12.707 --> 30:14.019
Must have been cold

30:14.122 --> 30:15.296
You can't put it

Get it in the oven.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.157

30:49.261 --> 30:50.918
At this point, I
just want to finish

30:51.021 --> 30:53.230
the dinner service so badly.

30:53.334 --> 30:55.923
It doesn't matter what
I have to do to do it.

30:56.026 --> 30:57.165

30:57.269 --> 30:59.443

Grazi.

31:25.124 --> 31:25.884
Wow.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.784
I'm happy whoever
made it, made it good,

31:29.888 --> 31:32.097

bad for them, because he

31:32.200 --> 31:34.823
got yelled at for a while.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.998
All right, I need an all dayon this station, where the hell

34:07.666 --> 34:08.632
We got one more ticket.

34:08.736 --> 34:09.599
This is the last one, chef.

34:09.702 --> 34:10.979
Fucking hell.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.568
This lamb is some of thevery best lamb I've ever had.

34:13.672 --> 34:16.330
Five desserts, 22.

34:16.433 --> 34:17.227
Let's go.

34:17.331 --> 34:18.539
Clear down, Christina.

34:21.990 --> 34:23.475
Line up, please.

34:23.578 --> 34:26.685
We got off to a great start.

34:26.788 --> 34:29.412
We just couldn't maintain it.

34:29.515 --> 34:31.793
I want all of you to
head back to the dorm,

34:31.897 --> 34:34.141
and decide which
two people should

34:34.244 --> 34:35.728
be put up for elimination.

34:35.832 --> 34:36.591
Understood?

34:36.695 --> 34:37.489
Yes, chef.

34:37.592 --> 34:40.008
Piss off.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.941
I feel like tonight's
overall dinner service,

34:42.045 --> 34:43.943
the worst performer was Mia.

34:44.047 --> 34:45.324
I feel like she
doesn't have what

34:45.428 --> 34:48.293
it takes to be that
gangster leader,

34:48.396 --> 34:50.018
beast mode executive chef.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.400
I just don't feel that
she has it in her.

34:52.504 --> 34:55.748
I know my votes are
is Heather and Mia.

34:55.852 --> 34:56.991
I go y'all two.

34:57.095 --> 35:01.961
I'm voting Matta, becausehe was lost, and Heather

35:02.065 --> 35:03.342
Jesus Christ.

35:03.446 --> 35:04.516
This is who I'm voting for.

35:04.619 --> 35:06.276
OK, that's why
I stopped talking.

35:06.380 --> 35:08.002
Don't fucking attack me, dude.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.832
There is absolutely no fuckingway I should go home tonight.

35:10.936 --> 35:14.146
Yes, I fucked up becauseI was put in a predicament

35:14.250 --> 35:17.529
that I couldn't fucking get outof because my team failed me.

35:17.632 --> 35:20.911
My team failed me.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.604
I'm going to go
with Brett and Mia.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.157
Ah, nothing died on me.

35:25.261 --> 35:26.607
Are you fucking kidding me?

35:26.710 --> 35:28.298
What, I had two New
Yorks come under?

35:28.402 --> 35:29.817
Real quick fix, that's it.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.198
It's definitely not me.

35:31.301 --> 35:34.822
That's absolutely, absolutelyirrelevant, in my opinion.

35:34.925 --> 35:38.722
And Matta, who
are you voting for?

35:38.826 --> 35:42.657
Heather, and, uh,
guess I'm gonna go Mia.

35:42.761 --> 35:45.660
I was getting different numbersshouted at me at the same time.

35:45.764 --> 35:47.283
So I couldn't get
anywhere with that.

35:47.386 --> 35:49.561
So I apologize for that.

35:49.664 --> 35:50.562
OK.

35:50.665 --> 35:51.494
I got to go in.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.152
It's cold out here.

35:54.255 --> 35:55.049
That's what it is.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.084
This all business right here.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.051
Ain't shit personal.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.157
Just business, know
what I'm saying?

35:59.260 --> 36:00.434
I'm pissed.

36:00.537 --> 36:02.367
I don't think I should begoing up for elimination.

36:02.470 --> 36:03.920
Brett's looking out for himself.

36:04.023 --> 36:08.166
And he'd say anything that'llkeep him in the competition.

36:08.269 --> 36:11.514
Just FYI, Brett, I think it'sbullshit that you guys aren't

36:11.617 --> 36:13.585
nominating each other, becauseI feel like you guys are trying

36:13.688 --> 36:15.138
to cover for each other's ass.

36:15.242 --> 36:16.104
Absolutely not.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.383
I should be nominated,
tell me why?

36:18.486 --> 36:20.350
Because you had
two steaks sent back.

36:20.454 --> 36:21.248
OK.

36:21.351 --> 36:22.318
Raw.

36:22.421 --> 36:23.629
All right, undercooked,
60 second refire.

36:23.733 --> 36:25.044
- OK.
- OK.

36:25.148 --> 36:26.253
But what did I have sent back?

36:26.356 --> 36:27.219
When was I dragging?

36:27.323 --> 36:28.393
You were like a
deer in headlights.

36:28.496 --> 36:29.704
Forget my facial expression.

36:29.808 --> 36:31.016
Forget my hands.

36:31.119 --> 36:33.363
Mia, I saw you like
this in your pan.

36:33.467 --> 36:34.330
I watched you.

36:34.433 --> 36:36.435
And you're like.

36:36.539 --> 36:39.369
Forget my-- forget themovements that I'm doing.

36:39.473 --> 36:41.406
When did I stop talking to you?

36:41.509 --> 36:43.062
First of all, I don'tneed to cover for anybody.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.167
I would--

36:44.271 --> 36:44.961
But I feel like it's
bullshit, because I

36:45.064 --> 36:46.204
didn't have shit sent back.

36:47.308 --> 36:48.136
I sent everything.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.655
And I was ready
for every ticket.

36:49.759 --> 36:51.623
Are you trying to intimidateme by raising your voice?

36:51.726 --> 36:52.831
I'm just asking.
- No.

36:52.934 --> 36:54.350
You feel like you getyour point across better?

36:54.453 --> 36:55.454
- No.
- OK, cool.

36:55.558 --> 36:56.938
It doesn't matter.
Am I intimidating you?

36:57.042 --> 36:58.285
Of course not.

36:58.388 --> 36:59.562
Then what does it matterif I raise my voice or not?

36:59.665 --> 37:00.597
I'm just wondering if youfeel like you need to raise

37:00.701 --> 37:01.909
your voice, because
does that make

37:02.012 --> 37:02.944
you feel better about yourself?

37:03.048 --> 37:03.842
No.

37:03.945 --> 37:04.843
I don't give a shit.

37:04.946 --> 37:06.051
I can talk however
the fuck I want.

37:06.154 --> 37:06.948
Of course you can.

37:07.052 --> 37:07.915
OK.

37:08.018 --> 37:09.330
OK, you do great
in challenges.

37:09.434 --> 37:10.538
But can't burn on the line.

37:10.642 --> 37:13.265
Yeah I fucking can.

37:13.369 --> 37:15.681
[music playing]

37:27.037 --> 37:28.280
What a night.

37:28.384 --> 37:29.488
Not good.

37:29.592 --> 37:32.042
Black jacket team, have
you reached a consensus?

37:32.146 --> 37:32.940
Yes, chef.

37:33.043 --> 37:35.425
Ariel, first nominee and why?

37:35.529 --> 37:38.428
First nominee tonight
is Heather, chef.

37:38.532 --> 37:41.086
The fish station was
struggling with cookery

37:41.189 --> 37:42.363
and with communication.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.020
The second nominee.

37:44.123 --> 37:47.989
Second nominee tonight isMia on the garnish station.

37:48.093 --> 37:49.957
Heather, Mia, step forward.

37:52.856 --> 37:55.445
OK, Heather?

37:55.549 --> 37:56.343
Yes, chef?

37:56.446 --> 37:57.413
Tough night.

37:57.516 --> 37:58.793
Very tough, Chef.

37:58.897 --> 38:00.554
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:00.657 --> 38:01.762
I haven't given up.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.798
I have the passion, thedrive, the determination.

38:03.902 --> 38:05.869
I don't shut down.

38:05.973 --> 38:07.354
I know I'm better than this.

38:07.457 --> 38:10.218
And I know I'm worthwinning this competition.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.531
During dinner service,
I had no communication,

38:12.635 --> 38:14.188
you know, with
certain team members.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.085
Mia--

38:15.189 --> 38:16.086
Just say the name.

38:16.190 --> 38:17.605
Yeah, you know, I
have Mia and Brett

38:17.709 --> 38:18.986
communicating in front of me.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.884
And I literally have
to scream at Brett--

38:20.988 --> 38:22.161
But you're standing
right next to me.

38:22.265 --> 38:23.473
You're hearing
everything I'm saying.

38:23.577 --> 38:25.061
I shouldn't have toscream across the brigade

38:25.164 --> 38:27.408
because you two are,
like, connected.

38:27.512 --> 38:30.169
And I'm just standing therelike a fucking lost dog.

38:30.273 --> 38:32.689
But you were also doing
the callbacks to Chef.

38:32.793 --> 38:35.485
And you didn't have the proteinthat he was asking you for.

38:35.589 --> 38:37.591
Right, and that's where Ihad asked you all day so I

38:37.694 --> 38:38.833
can have the proteins ready.

38:38.937 --> 38:40.801
And you couldn't do thatbecause you had a hard time

38:40.904 --> 38:41.664
reheating vegetables.

38:41.767 --> 38:42.941
So we're good.

38:43.044 --> 38:45.530
No, I had everything onthe pass when they needed it.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.048
And nothing got sent back.

38:47.152 --> 38:50.397
Mia, why do you think youshould stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:50.500 --> 38:52.709
And what the fuck
happened tonight?

38:52.813 --> 38:55.091
I did the best I could
under the circumstances.

38:55.194 --> 38:57.921
And I feel like I
delivered in my station.

38:58.025 --> 38:58.853
I wasn't doing callbacks.

38:58.957 --> 39:00.027
Say it, yes or no?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.269
A couple of times, yeah.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.340
At the beginning, yes.

39:02.443 --> 39:04.307
I feel like I was
always doing callbacks.

39:04.411 --> 39:06.033
You would tell me the
garnish you needed.

39:06.136 --> 39:06.930
I would say, OK.

39:07.034 --> 39:07.862
I would repeat it.

39:07.966 --> 39:08.898
And I would have it ready.

39:09.001 --> 39:12.902
I always had my garnish ready.

39:13.005 --> 39:16.595
Matta, based oneverything you saw tonight,

39:16.699 --> 39:19.495
and during the course
of the competition,

39:19.598 --> 39:21.669
who should go home?

39:21.773 --> 39:23.153
Tonight, I think
Heather struggled

39:23.257 --> 39:24.845
the most on the fish station.

39:24.948 --> 39:28.124
So in my opinion, Heatherwas the weaker performer.

39:28.227 --> 39:29.021
Brett.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.369
Based on overall, Mia, chef.

39:31.472 --> 39:32.749
She does good in challenges.

39:32.853 --> 39:34.751
From what I've heard fromher former teammates,

39:34.855 --> 39:36.615
that when it comes to
time to dinner service

39:36.719 --> 39:38.859
she can't get it in
like everybody else.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.205
Ariel?

39:40.308 --> 39:43.415
In terms of culinary skilland overall, unfortunately

39:43.519 --> 39:44.796
I would have to say
the person who should

39:44.899 --> 39:48.247
go home would be Heather, Chef.

39:48.351 --> 39:56.566
My decision is Heather.

39:59.707 --> 40:02.400
You're not ready to
be my executive chef.

40:02.503 --> 40:04.643
Give me your jacket, please.

40:04.747 --> 40:07.128
Thank you for the callback.

40:07.232 --> 40:08.129
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

40:08.233 --> 40:09.027
Say hi to Logan.

40:09.130 --> 40:09.924
I will, thank you.

40:12.962 --> 40:15.896
I never thought I'd be leavingwithout the executive chef

40:15.999 --> 40:17.035
position.

40:17.138 --> 40:18.588
I came out guns blazing.

40:18.692 --> 40:21.591
And I was ready
to prove a point.

40:21.695 --> 40:23.766
I was the runner
up of season 16.

40:23.869 --> 40:25.906
That door is mine
this time, guys.

40:26.009 --> 40:26.907
Heather, 5 out of 5.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.530
Good job.

40:29.634 --> 40:32.222
Coming back to Hell's
Kitchen a second time,

40:32.326 --> 40:34.432
it mentally challenges you.

40:34.535 --> 40:35.329
There you go.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.226
You can walk that.

40:36.330 --> 40:37.573
Please would be nice, right?

40:37.676 --> 40:39.229
Yeah, fuck off, man.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.197
I'm the one who's gottastand there in embarrassment.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.095
Get out!

40:43.199 --> 40:44.407
I can run right now.

40:44.511 --> 40:45.926
I just told you
I need two minutes

40:46.029 --> 40:47.168
in the oven for the halibut.

40:47.272 --> 40:48.515
Please listen to me.

40:48.618 --> 40:51.379
At the end of the day, Ineed to show my son that you

40:51.483 --> 40:53.899
need to be the one to
drive your self-esteem

40:54.003 --> 40:56.246
and your confidence.

40:56.350 --> 40:59.318
You thought it
was the end of me!

40:59.422 --> 41:04.082
Oh, wow, don't look
so fucking happy.

41:04.185 --> 41:07.534
Without a doubt, missingmy son, it broke me.

41:07.637 --> 41:09.501
I thought I was indestructible.

41:09.605 --> 41:12.539
But at the end of the
day, I just want my kid.

41:15.576 --> 41:17.509
You are the final four.

41:17.613 --> 41:22.169
You've got to push everysingle second in that kitchen.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.204
Is that understood?

41:23.308 --> 41:24.205
Yes, Chef.

41:24.309 --> 41:26.276
Get out of here.

41:26.380 --> 41:28.416
They think I'm going tolet them walk all over me,

41:28.520 --> 41:29.901
they're fucking wrong.

41:30.004 --> 41:31.247
All of them.

41:31.350 --> 41:33.042
They can kiss my ass.

41:33.145 --> 41:34.940
I'm here to fucking win.

41:37.011 --> 41:38.323
Final four, yo.

41:38.426 --> 41:41.568
I'm at a 25% chance to
win this competition.

41:41.671 --> 41:43.121
I'll take those odds any day.

41:43.224 --> 41:46.296
I've been waiting
years for this moment.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.091
I think my performance
has been great.

41:48.195 --> 41:49.576
I worked very hard tonight.

41:49.679 --> 41:53.165
And I'm motivated unlike I'veever been motivated before.

41:53.269 --> 41:54.926
This is it.

41:55.029 --> 41:57.066
It's all in right now.

41:57.169 --> 41:59.275
Too many times, Heather
blamed her mistakes

41:59.378 --> 42:01.035
on having a bad day.

42:01.139 --> 42:02.520
I'm not looking for apologies.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.556
I'm looking for
an executive chef.

42:11.183 --> 42:13.220
NARRATOR: Next time
on Hell's Kitchen.

42:13.323 --> 42:17.155
Mia, between us, have you hada little tequila this morning?

42:17.258 --> 42:18.190
Yeah.

42:18.294 --> 42:20.538
when it comes to
booze, I'm a pro.

42:20.641 --> 42:23.575
NARRATOR: Will one chefhave a little too much fun?

42:23.679 --> 42:25.163
Well, you have a
shot glass right there.

42:25.266 --> 42:27.475
And I have some
tequila right here.

42:27.579 --> 42:28.373
I'm Puerto Rican.

42:28.476 --> 42:30.168
This is what we do.

42:30.271 --> 42:33.343
NARRATOR: Will her naughtybehavior rub off on the others?

42:33.447 --> 42:35.829
Woo!
