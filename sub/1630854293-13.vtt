00:02.530 --> 00:04.050
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...
Pablo Fuentes.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.990
(gunshot)
HICKS:
<i>Pablo and Ricardo Fuentes,</i>

00:07.190 --> 00:09.260
<i>father and son, been in a messy</i>
<i>eminent domain battle.</i>

00:09.460 --> 00:10.560
SHERIFF:
<i>The city's been forcibly</i>

00:10.760 --> 00:12.190
buying up all the properties
in the area.

00:12.390 --> 00:13.460
They want to build
a concert venue.

00:13.660 --> 00:14.530
He's not waking up.

00:14.730 --> 00:15.530
HICKS:
Let me come in.

00:15.730 --> 00:16.960
<i>I'll take his place</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:18.500
<i>and you let me get him</i>
<i>to a hospital.</i>

00:18.700 --> 00:20.230
Your next priority
is to get that baby out.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.770
<i>Once we do that, you make entry</i>
<i>and put an end to this thing.</i>

00:21.970 --> 00:23.000
What's the safe word?

00:23.200 --> 00:24.850
(grunting)

00:25.720 --> 00:26.760
July.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.340
You said nobody would get hurt!

00:30.540 --> 00:32.850
Miguel, don't, I thought
we were doing the right thing.

00:33.050 --> 00:34.310
Look what it cost us.

00:34.510 --> 00:35.780
HONDO: <i>If they had just</i>
<i>let go of the house,</i>

00:35.980 --> 00:37.320
<i>they could've kept on</i>
<i>as a family.</i>

00:37.520 --> 00:40.220
Sometimes when the past
grabs ahold of you...

00:40.420 --> 00:42.640
it just doesn't let go.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.160
* *

00:46.360 --> 00:47.930
FLANAGAN:
<i>Now, it took a few years</i>

00:48.130 --> 00:49.630
and a lot of red tape, but...

00:49.830 --> 00:51.730
L.A.'s newest concert venue,

00:51.930 --> 00:56.000
the Crescenta Amphitheatre,
is finally under construction.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.670
(applause)

00:58.870 --> 00:59.740
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.280
(applause)
(engine revving)

01:02.480 --> 01:03.910
(automatic gunfire)

01:04.110 --> 01:06.760
(screaming)
(gunfire)

01:09.730 --> 01:11.650
There'll be no
construction today!

01:11.850 --> 01:13.890
You're all trespassing
on stolen land!

01:14.090 --> 01:14.950
Get on the ground!

01:15.150 --> 01:16.220
(gunfire)

01:16.420 --> 01:18.320
(screaming)
GUNMAN: Don't move!

01:18.520 --> 01:20.430
See what happens
if you try to run?

01:20.630 --> 01:21.830
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:22.030 --> 01:24.400
On your knees, now!
Throw me your phones!

01:24.600 --> 01:26.900
Come on. Throw them.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.820
* *

01:31.120 --> 01:35.510
You. Pick up your camera.
I've got something to say.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.840
There are consequences
for building on land

01:38.040 --> 01:40.380
that was taken from its owners
against their will.

01:40.580 --> 01:41.550
FLANAGAN:
No. No, no.

01:41.750 --> 01:42.880
Nothing was taken.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.280
All the landowners
were fairly compensated.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.650
Fairly compensated?!

01:46.850 --> 01:48.720
(screaming)
There was nothing fair about it!

01:48.920 --> 01:52.490
More than 50 families
forced out of their own homes.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.890
And you think calling it
"eminent domain" somehow

01:55.090 --> 01:57.960
cleanses you?
It was illegal seizure!

01:58.160 --> 01:59.570
Common theft!

01:59.770 --> 02:02.030
And we won't stand for it!

02:02.240 --> 02:04.150
* *

02:08.520 --> 02:10.610
Dispatch, this is
2-7 Patrol responding.

02:10.810 --> 02:12.880
We have armed intruders at
the Crescenta Amphitheatre site.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.330
I see hostages,
at least two gunmen...

02:16.770 --> 02:19.150
DISPATCHER:
2-7 Patrol, come in.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.250
Security guard radio'd in.
Cops'll be coming soon.

02:21.450 --> 02:22.390
What are we gonna do?

02:22.590 --> 02:23.820
MIGUEL:
We're not leaving until we

02:24.020 --> 02:26.410
shut this place down,
just like we planned.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.420
(engine starts)

02:41.290 --> 02:43.060
* *

02:45.560 --> 02:47.380
What's going on, Cabrera?

02:47.580 --> 02:49.110
A little tired?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.520
Didn't get
much sleep, huh?

02:50.720 --> 02:52.890
Oh, that's right.
Had the big date last night.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.570
This one a keeper?

02:55.440 --> 02:56.790
Guess not.

02:56.990 --> 02:58.620
TAN: Couldn't've been worse
than the last guy. Come on.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.330
The one who forgot to mention
he was on house arrest?

03:00.530 --> 03:01.990
STREET:
Or what about the one
that ate all the toppings

03:02.190 --> 03:05.030
off your pizza... then
left you with the check.

03:05.230 --> 03:07.130
Let's just say, I'm fast
turning into a cynic

03:07.330 --> 03:08.570
when it comes to love.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.470
Lucky for me I'm married,
don't have to deal

03:10.670 --> 03:11.800
with the dating world.
What I hear from you and Luca,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.340
it sounds like
the Wild West out there.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.540
Hey.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.140
Sure you'll find
"the one," though.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.460
Just got to keep swiping right.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.420
Come on. Couldn't
have been that bad.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.450
I'm sure my date
would say it was.

03:24.650 --> 03:27.620
I couldn't focus on him,
I was too distracted

03:27.820 --> 03:29.290
the whole time.

03:29.490 --> 03:30.970
What do you mean? Why?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.030
Tan's wife was at
the restaurant.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.060
With a guy who
definitely wasn't Tan.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.400
She's a sports agent.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.000
She has to wine and dine
clients all the time.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.900
Do you play footsie under
the table with clients?

03:42.100 --> 03:43.900
Or make out with them
at the valet stand?

03:44.100 --> 03:45.870
They were all over
each other, Street.

03:46.070 --> 03:49.610
And y-you're positive
that it was Bonnie?

03:49.810 --> 03:51.280
I've never met her in person,

03:51.480 --> 03:54.050
but Tan's forever posting her
picture on his social media.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.450
It was definitely her.

03:55.650 --> 03:56.720
So, what do I do?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.550
If I don't tell him,

03:58.750 --> 04:00.490
I'm keeping a secret
from my teammate.

04:00.690 --> 04:02.460
We're keeping a secret.

04:02.660 --> 04:03.940
(phones beeping)

04:05.070 --> 04:07.890
A hostage situation.
We got to roll.

04:08.090 --> 04:09.750
* *

04:18.590 --> 04:20.710
(sirens approaching)

04:20.910 --> 04:22.880
They're coming.
Cops are here.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.540
We need to buy
a little more time.

04:24.740 --> 04:25.990
Let's go.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.860
(sirens wailing)

04:35.470 --> 04:36.710
(gunfire)

04:39.040 --> 04:41.010
(glass shattering)
(grunting)

04:41.880 --> 04:43.400
Hey, they're taking fire!

04:43.600 --> 04:45.010
Patrol, get out of there.
Back out!

04:49.620 --> 04:51.770
* *

04:51.970 --> 04:53.820
(gunfire continues)

04:54.390 --> 04:55.210
Damn it!

04:55.410 --> 04:56.680
The entrance
is blocked!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.340
(sirens wailing)

04:58.540 --> 04:59.860
Incoming!

05:00.660 --> 05:02.060
(glass shatters)

05:03.000 --> 05:04.830
We got no eyes here, boss.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.720
The two gunmen are retreating.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.950
I can't see beyond
the containers

05:09.150 --> 05:10.660
to know what's
going on, though.

05:10.860 --> 05:11.590
HONDO:
Street, get the
drone in the air.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.090
They've got hostages.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.290
We need to know what we're
dealing with in there.

05:15.490 --> 05:16.900
(whirring)

05:17.100 --> 05:18.100
Luca, can you
get us in there?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.060
LUCA:
Hell yeah.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.300
Betty's pushed
through worse.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.670
All right, do it now.

05:21.870 --> 05:24.290
* *

05:29.260 --> 05:30.810
Looks like they've circled
the shipping containers.

05:31.010 --> 05:33.300
<i>Fortified their position.</i>

05:36.530 --> 05:37.680
CABRERA:
Security who called it in.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.590
They shot the poor guy.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.220
20-David to Command,

05:41.420 --> 05:43.460
one casualty on-site.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.090
Roll an R/A on our call.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.810
* *

05:49.950 --> 05:51.630
This is Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT!

05:51.830 --> 05:54.200
We know you've got
hostages in there.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.740
Let's talk about what you
need so we can end all this.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.070
Nothing you can give us!

05:59.270 --> 06:00.570
HONDO:
Don't be so sure.

06:00.770 --> 06:03.440
No need for more people
to get hurt.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
Talk to me!

06:04.840 --> 06:05.680
What are they
doing in there?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.380
Street. Anything?

06:07.580 --> 06:08.910
STREET:
Just a few more seconds.

06:09.110 --> 06:12.250
They've got a drone.
We're running out of time.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.790
Come on, man, hurry up!

06:13.990 --> 06:15.290
You're not gonna get
away with this.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.290
You know that, right?
FLANAGAN:
Come on!

06:17.490 --> 06:20.280
This is stupid.
You can't stop progress.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.800
(grunts)

06:23.000 --> 06:24.260
STREET: Hondo,
they've got explosives.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.760
At least three hostages
wired to blow.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.400
We can't wait.
We got to move.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.830
20-David to Command.

06:29.030 --> 06:30.470
Explosives on-site.

06:30.670 --> 06:31.870
We need a bomb unit

06:32.070 --> 06:32.970
at our location ASAP.

06:33.170 --> 06:34.110
MAN:
There, I got it. We're good.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.170
All right.

06:35.370 --> 06:36.170
Set the timer.

06:36.370 --> 06:37.280
(beeps)
Let's go.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.880
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

06:39.080 --> 06:40.280
Go!

06:40.480 --> 06:41.810
* *

06:42.010 --> 06:44.270
HONDO:
D-Team, fall in on me.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.140
* *

06:54.180 --> 06:55.430
I've got eyes
on the hostages.

06:55.630 --> 06:56.800
They're strapped
with explosives.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.160
I don't see any gunmen.
TAN: Over there.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.300
On an ATV.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.330
(engine revving)

07:01.530 --> 07:02.770
Hondo, we go in pursuit?

07:02.970 --> 07:04.270
No, we can't. We got to
free these hostages.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.710
Street, Cabrera, get those other
people out of here.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.040
Luca, Tan, you're with me
on these three.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.220
Move in.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.240
All right, everybody,
out this way.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.510
Out this way!
LUCA: Got to hurry.

07:13.710 --> 07:14.650
30 seconds on the timer, boss.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.050
Come on!
Get up!

07:16.250 --> 07:16.850
Go, go, go.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.450
(clamoring, shouting)

07:18.650 --> 07:19.990
TAN:
All right, he's alive

07:20.190 --> 07:21.290
but unresponsive.
HONDO:
I don't see any tripwires.

07:21.490 --> 07:22.390
I think we're clear
to cut him free

07:22.590 --> 07:23.560
and get him out of here.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.260
You're good.
Go, go, go.

07:25.460 --> 07:26.690
Come on, you're free.
Let's go.

07:26.890 --> 07:28.590
Come on, we got to go.

07:28.790 --> 07:29.800
Hondo!

07:30.000 --> 07:32.050
Don't wait on me!
I got this guy!

07:34.550 --> 07:35.500
Hey.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.600
Hey. Grab me.
Grab ahold of me.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.400
Come on, come on.

07:39.610 --> 07:40.770
* *

07:40.970 --> 07:41.970
He's not gonna make it.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.760
Hondo, come on!
Get down!

07:44.790 --> 07:46.380
Mouth open,
cover your ears!

07:46.580 --> 07:47.930
(beeps)

07:49.060 --> 07:51.580
(high-pitched ringing)

07:51.780 --> 07:54.070
* *

07:58.110 --> 07:59.990
Hondo, Luca,
I want a debrief now,

08:00.190 --> 08:01.790
before you hit
the showers.
Yes, sir.

08:01.990 --> 08:03.130
But can I ask, what're
you still doing here?

08:03.330 --> 08:04.430
I thought you were on
that bridge standoff

08:04.630 --> 08:05.760
with 40-Squad
all night.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.770
I was. I was already
home when I got the alert

08:07.970 --> 08:09.470
about the
Crescenta Amphitheatre.

08:09.670 --> 08:12.540
Given our history with
the site, I came back.

08:12.740 --> 08:13.740
Our history, sir?

08:13.940 --> 08:15.040
Yeah, you didn't
recognize it?

08:15.240 --> 08:17.210
Well, I'm sure it
looks different now.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.080
Three years ago,
all of us were there.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.410
The Fuentes home. That barricade
where you were held hostage.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.880
Their house was one
of the homes razed

08:23.080 --> 08:24.280
to make room for
construction.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.850
Yeah, anyone get close
enough to ID the gunmen?

08:27.050 --> 08:28.550
They were all masked up,
but one of the hostages

08:28.750 --> 08:29.790
got everything on camera.

08:29.990 --> 08:30.890
We had him upload it
to our site.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.060
All right, good.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.360
More than 50 families forced
out of their own homes.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.560
And you think calling it
"eminent domain"

08:37.760 --> 08:38.730
somehow cleanses you?

08:38.930 --> 08:40.200
It was illegal seizure!

08:40.400 --> 08:41.670
Common theft!

08:41.870 --> 08:44.140
And we won't stand for it!

08:44.340 --> 08:45.270
Freeze it.

08:45.470 --> 08:49.160
I know that voice.
Those eyes.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.210
That's Miguel Fuentes.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.680
What the hell
is he caught up in?

08:53.880 --> 08:54.950
These guys were
out to make a point.

08:55.150 --> 08:56.410
And whatever it is,
it ain't over.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.120
Yeah, well, Miguel didn't
just lose his home that day,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.850
he watched his father die
at the hands of SWAT.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.150
We need to find him
and put an end to this.

09:01.350 --> 09:02.560
All right, I'll
put out a BOLO,

09:02.760 --> 09:04.720
get his photo to every
unit, every agency.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.990
Look, he can't hide.
Someone'll find him.

09:06.190 --> 09:07.330
That's not good enough.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.760
This started with SWAT
and it's got to be SWAT

09:08.960 --> 09:10.100
that brings him in.
You understand me?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.250
Yes, sir.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.950
* *

09:53.090 --> 09:55.410
Fill me in on the last three
years of Miguel Fuentes' life.

09:55.610 --> 09:56.540
Well, from what I can tell,

09:56.740 --> 09:58.110
he's spent most
of it behind bars.

09:58.310 --> 10:00.680
He did a stint in juvie after
the barricade three years ago,

10:00.880 --> 10:02.310
then an arrest for arson,

10:02.510 --> 10:03.650
then he spent some
time in Twin Towers

10:03.850 --> 10:05.450
for an assault
when he turned 18.

10:05.650 --> 10:06.820
He's been off the grid
ever since.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.120
All right, we need to ID
the others in his crew,

10:09.320 --> 10:10.990
find out where they might hide,
and if they'll strike again.

10:11.190 --> 10:13.660
Okay, Street and Cabrera are
working on that as we speak.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.900
Sir, when you were
inside the Fuentes home,

10:18.100 --> 10:19.260
did you talk with Miguel?

10:19.460 --> 10:21.270
Just enough to think
he'd go down a better path,

10:21.470 --> 10:23.700
but obviously I was wrong.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.370
You know, I made
a connection

10:25.570 --> 10:27.110
with Miguel's grandfather
Pablo that day.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.510
Maybe if I reach out to him,
he might know who his grandson

10:29.710 --> 10:30.910
has been palling around
with. Might bear a lead.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.210
I'm going to call
Cali Correctional...

10:32.410 --> 10:33.380
Actually, sir,
it's too late.

10:33.580 --> 10:34.610
Pablo Fuentes

10:34.810 --> 10:36.920
passed away in
prison last month.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.320
It's probably why
the developers

10:38.520 --> 10:39.920
were finally able
to break ground.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.920
He was still fighting a
legal battle against the city.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.790
He died, the battle
died with him.

10:43.990 --> 10:46.460
Well, I guess that explains
why this is all happening now.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.890
They must've pushed
Miguel over the edge.

10:48.090 --> 10:49.190
Commander, look,

10:49.390 --> 10:51.360
you've been on the clock
for what, 24 hours now?

10:51.560 --> 10:52.870
Why don't you head home?

10:53.070 --> 10:55.150
We'll call you
if something breaks.

10:55.980 --> 10:59.940
What about Miguel's
mother, Lupe Fuentes?

11:00.140 --> 11:01.270
I saved her life that day,

11:01.470 --> 11:03.240
I helped her
and her baby escape.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.840
Maybe she could help us.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.480
Why don't you and Hondo
pick her up and bring her in?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.110
Yes, sir.
And what about you?

11:09.310 --> 11:12.530
I've got coffee. Don't worry
about me. Go, get moving.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.190
STREET: I looked
at all of Miguel's

11:18.390 --> 11:19.560
former cellmates.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.090
None of them popped
as possible accomplices.

11:21.290 --> 11:22.900
Either they're still locked up,
or they alibi out.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.400
Yeah, I'm not having any luck
with Miguel's financials either.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.870
I guess I should've
seen that coming,

11:27.070 --> 11:28.570
given he has no employment
records or bank statements.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.000
Yeah. What're you working on?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.470
Miguel's social media.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.370
You might not be having any
luck tracking him physically,

11:33.570 --> 11:34.770
but I got him virtually.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.240
He can't help but keep
an online persona going,

11:36.440 --> 11:37.980
even if he's trying to
hide his real identity.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.110
We already knew he was
passionate about the cause.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.010
How's this get us to
the rest of the crew?

11:42.210 --> 11:44.050
I'm running a search
through all his photos,

11:44.250 --> 11:46.050
filtering for specific
physical markers

11:46.250 --> 11:47.690
that the witnesses
reported this morning.

11:47.890 --> 11:51.490
Particular scars,
tattoos, pink hair...

11:51.690 --> 11:52.590
Found this.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.590
That's got to be
her. Who is she?

11:54.790 --> 11:56.030
I don't know yet.
It's gonna take some digging.

11:56.230 --> 11:58.060
But if I can find her
in a photo that links

11:58.260 --> 11:59.100
to both their accounts,

11:59.300 --> 12:00.300
we might just have her.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.530
Got to let the search
do its thing...

12:02.730 --> 12:04.070
Sorry to interrupt.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.440
I know you guys are
having a crazy day.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.470
It's all over the news.

12:07.670 --> 12:08.670
Hey, Jim. How are you?

12:08.870 --> 12:09.780
Nice to see you, Bonnie.
You, too.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.730
Hey, what are you doing?
Hi.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.480
I just need to swap
cars with you, babe.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.020
I've got a presentation for the
L.A. Galaxy this afternoon.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.980
Yeah, of course.
I-I wouldn't have taken yours,

12:19.180 --> 12:20.850
but I thought you weren't
getting back until later.

12:21.050 --> 12:22.990
Yeah, well, I wrapped
everything up in Atlanta,

12:23.190 --> 12:25.720
decided to grab an earlier
flight this morning.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.960
Hey, you haven't met
Cabrera yet. Come on.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.700
Cabrera, this is
my wife Bonnie.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.900
Bonnie, this is Cabrera.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.400
Alexis. Nice to
finally meet you.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.870
Hey, did I, uh, did I hear you
say you just flew in?

12:37.070 --> 12:39.040
Yeah, just in time
for a big meeting.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.270
And then another
flight out tomorrow morning.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.680
Bonnie's become one of her
firm's top sports agents.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.680
Keeps her pretty busy.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.230
I'm sure it does.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.080
Look, I don't want
to keep you guys.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.750
Uh, your keys
are in my locker.

12:50.950 --> 12:52.120
I'll grab them
and walk you out.
Okay.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.170
Bye, Jim.
Nice meeting you, Alexis.
Bye.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.690
Are you absolutely positive

13:01.890 --> 13:03.700
that it was Bonnie
you saw last night?
Yes.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.010
100%. It was her.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.630
Tan needs to
know the truth.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.140
Well, knowing how
much he loves her,

13:11.340 --> 13:13.110
not sure I want to be the one
to blow up his marriage.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.560
How about you?

13:16.390 --> 13:18.280
(knocking)

13:18.480 --> 13:19.280
Yeah.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.310
I heard a rumor you were out

13:20.510 --> 13:21.780
with 40-Squad all night.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.520
I didn't expect
to find you here.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.850
I got a lot
going on, Doc.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.290
I thought that we agreed
that you were going to

13:27.490 --> 13:28.750
take better
care of yourself,

13:28.950 --> 13:30.920
find a way to separate
from the job,

13:31.120 --> 13:32.660
so that at least
it could afford you

13:32.860 --> 13:34.360
some time to
get some rest.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.930
Well, in a perfect world, sure.

13:36.130 --> 13:38.160
But 40-Squad had a situation.
I needed to be there.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.970
And now we got
another situation.

13:40.170 --> 13:43.070
If by situation,
you mean Miguel Fuentes?
That's right.

13:43.270 --> 13:45.640
How many times in the past
three years have I tried

13:45.840 --> 13:47.670
to get you
to talk about that day?

13:47.870 --> 13:51.010
And every time,
you seem to avoid it.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.610
Because there's
nothing to talk about.
Come on, Robert.

13:53.810 --> 13:57.150
That must've been
a traumatic experience for you.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.180
You were held prisoner.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.220
A man was killed.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.520
And now Miguel is caught up

14:01.720 --> 14:02.790
in this mess today?

14:02.990 --> 14:06.320
It's got to bring up
some tough memories.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.990
It has to be personal.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.500
A family was destroyed and I
was right in the middle of it.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.700
So, yeah, of course
it's personal.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.500
Do you feel that
you are responsible

14:14.700 --> 14:15.930
for Miguel being in trouble?

14:16.130 --> 14:18.700
(stammers)
We'll never know what Miguel

14:18.900 --> 14:20.040
could've or might've done
with his life

14:20.240 --> 14:21.570
if that day had gone
differently.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.160
(phone buzzing)
Is that a yes or a no?

14:24.090 --> 14:25.880
I'm afraid our time's up.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.950
Miguel's mother's here, I need
to have a word with her.

14:28.150 --> 14:29.580
You're avoiding the topic again.

14:29.780 --> 14:30.950
Well, I got a lot going on.

14:31.150 --> 14:32.620
It's not the right day
for a head-shrink.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.690
Well, if you reconsider,
I'll be in my office.

14:34.890 --> 14:37.010
Well, with any luck,
I won't be.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.060
Mrs. Fuentes.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.860
Thank you for
coming down here.

14:43.060 --> 14:43.730
Come on.

14:43.930 --> 14:45.460
Like I had a choice.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.500
I hope your daughter's
doing well.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.870
She's got to be, what,
four years old now?

14:50.070 --> 14:51.600
My daughter's fine.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.470
But this obviously
isn't about her.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.740
It's about Miguel, so...

14:55.940 --> 14:57.680
Look, we need your
help to find him

14:57.880 --> 14:59.510
before he gets into
any more trouble.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.710
After what you did
three years ago,

15:02.910 --> 15:05.020
now you expect my
cooperation?

15:05.220 --> 15:06.280
LUCA:
Commander Hicks

15:06.480 --> 15:07.950
helped you that day.

15:08.150 --> 15:09.960
I mean, he got you
and your baby out safely.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.520
Only so that his men
could attack the house

15:12.720 --> 15:13.990
and kill my husband.

15:14.190 --> 15:16.960
Mrs. Fuentes, I feel bad
about what happened that day,

15:17.160 --> 15:18.700
but a deputy had been shot.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.500
And I did what I had to do
to save that man's life.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
At what cost?

15:23.900 --> 15:24.970
Have you ever thought about

15:25.170 --> 15:27.140
how that day
destroyed our lives?

15:27.340 --> 15:28.860
Yes.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.940
And that was a horrible day.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.580
You lost your husband,
your home...

15:33.780 --> 15:35.430
I lost everything.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.720
I was a happy
wife and mother,

15:37.920 --> 15:42.390
surrounded by family
in the home I loved.

15:42.590 --> 15:45.120
Now, I'm a widow,

15:45.320 --> 15:48.890
raising my daughter alone
in a one-bedroom apartment

15:49.090 --> 15:51.500
that I can barely afford,

15:51.700 --> 15:53.670
all our money spent on

15:53.870 --> 15:57.500
funerals and lawyers.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.170
How is that fair?

15:59.370 --> 16:02.070
It's not. I'm, uh...

16:02.270 --> 16:04.460
I'm truly sorry
for what you lost.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.950
Mrs. Fuentes.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.210
We really need
to find Miguel.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.580
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

16:11.780 --> 16:14.650
Miguel and I...

16:14.850 --> 16:16.250
He carries
so much rage,

16:16.450 --> 16:19.420
I finally had to ask him
to stay away from us,

16:19.620 --> 16:21.490
for my daughter's sake.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.960
When did you speak to him last?

16:24.160 --> 16:26.500
About a month ago.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.270
He came by just to tell me
his grandfather had died.

16:29.470 --> 16:32.300
He was with three
others this morning.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.120
Do you have any idea
who they might be?

16:36.060 --> 16:38.040
If I were to guess,

16:38.240 --> 16:40.150
maybe other kids from
our old neighborhood.

16:40.350 --> 16:41.880
Lot of families
lost their homes.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.650
Let's pull up a roster of
everyone who lived in that area

16:44.850 --> 16:47.390
before the neighborhood
was razed.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.650
Thank you, Mrs. Fuentes.

16:48.850 --> 16:50.110
Commander?

16:51.170 --> 16:54.930
I understand that what
Miguel did is wrong,

16:55.130 --> 16:57.310
and that he has to be stopped.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.520
But I already buried my husband.

17:02.850 --> 17:05.320
Please don't make me
bury my son, too.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.870
Heard we got a positive ID

17:09.070 --> 17:10.480
on one of Miguel's crew.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.780
Yes, sir. Just landed it.
Her name's Roxana Pineda.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.250
We're pretty sure she's
Miguel's girlfriend,

17:15.450 --> 17:17.350
but definitely not from
the same neighborhood.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.520
Private schools in Brentwood.
Dropped out of Princeton.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.990
Poor little rich girl.

17:21.190 --> 17:22.420
Don't know if it's
daddy issues or what,

17:22.620 --> 17:24.160
but anti-establishment
seems to be her thing.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.290
She's got a number of arrests,

17:25.490 --> 17:26.890
most of them
misdemeanor vandalism

17:27.090 --> 17:28.430
and trespassing,
all of them tied to protests.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.230
Well, she's gone way
beyond protests this time.

17:30.430 --> 17:32.330
We have an address?
CABRERA:
None. Unless an apartment

17:32.530 --> 17:33.470
in Paris counts.

17:33.670 --> 17:34.700
We do have financials, though.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.730
Our warrant gives us
pretty broad access.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.240
We're following credit
cards, bank statements

17:38.440 --> 17:40.370
and cash apps, anything
registered in her name.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.210
Anything on the other
two members of his crew?
CABRERA:
Still working on it.

17:42.410 --> 17:44.680
We're hoping links to Roxana
and Miguel give them up.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.080
All right, Luca's
putting together a list

17:46.280 --> 17:47.510
of all the families
that lost homes

17:47.710 --> 17:49.310
to make way for the
Crescenta Amphitheatre.

17:49.510 --> 17:50.950
You make sure you
cross-reference with those.

17:51.150 --> 17:54.120
Hold on. Just got a hit
from a ChargePoint.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.590
Roxana just plugged
her electric car

17:55.790 --> 17:57.320
into a charging station
in Encino.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.190
You want us to roll out?
80-Squad's already
in the area.

17:59.390 --> 18:03.250
Get them on it. I want
this crew in custody now.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.570
TAN: Commander, 80-Squad grabbed
the girl. What about the others?

18:14.770 --> 18:15.970
Well, she was alone.
But while her car was charging,

18:16.170 --> 18:17.580
she went to the bank
across the street,

18:17.780 --> 18:19.710
withdrew $10,000 in cash.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.110
TAN:
Risked identifying herself

18:21.310 --> 18:22.550
for a full battery
and ten G's.

18:22.750 --> 18:23.950
LUCA:
Doesn't seem worth it.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.020
But then again, she's not
exactly driven by logic.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.520
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's over for her.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.510
No. It's not even close to over.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.540
* *

18:34.310 --> 18:36.590
HONDO:
Congratulations, Roxana.
You've done it.

18:36.790 --> 18:40.670
You want to be a rebel,
a disrupter.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.500
Showing up to every
protest and attaching

18:42.700 --> 18:44.670
yourself to every cause.

18:44.870 --> 18:45.940
You know, a little
rich girl like you,

18:46.140 --> 18:48.240
I would've labeled
you a poser. But no.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.610
You're all in on this one.

18:49.810 --> 18:51.980
Commission of a murder
during an act of terror.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.680
Okay? That's almost certain
life. Hope it was worth it.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.180
Would've been more worth it
if this morning went as planned.

18:57.380 --> 18:58.980
But there'll be more.
You'll see.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.590
Are you really okay
with spending the rest

19:00.790 --> 19:02.020
of your life in prison
for Miguel's cause?

19:02.220 --> 19:03.920
Someone has to fight
for the innocent people

19:04.120 --> 19:07.390
whose lives are destroyed in
the name of so-called progress.

19:07.590 --> 19:08.690
What about the innocent people

19:08.890 --> 19:10.260
that you tried to blow up
this morning?

19:10.460 --> 19:12.530
Those developers
aren't innocent.

19:12.730 --> 19:15.000
Gentrification is just
genocide in slow motion.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.830
(scoffs)
All right.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.640
Your father earned
his fortune in real estate.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.870
You grew up in Brentwood.

19:20.070 --> 19:21.610
You really gonna try
to pretend that this

19:21.810 --> 19:22.970
is about anything more
than getting back at Daddy?

19:23.170 --> 19:25.840
I don't speak to
my father anymore.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.350
I don't want anything from him.

19:27.550 --> 19:28.780
Except for the $10,000
that you withdrew

19:28.980 --> 19:30.700
from an account that he funds.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.950
My mother is Chicana.
I am Chicana.

19:35.150 --> 19:37.920
And I hold my head up knowing
at least I stand for something.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.110
(scoffs)

19:40.280 --> 19:41.930
What about you?

19:42.130 --> 19:44.630
You protect and serve
your oppressors.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.360
What do you stand for?

19:46.560 --> 19:50.800
Look, the only chance that you
have of ever walking free again

19:51.000 --> 19:52.840
is if you help us find
the rest of your crew.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.570
Okay? We can tell the
D.A. you cooperated,

19:55.770 --> 19:56.610
maybe get your
sentenced reduced.

19:56.810 --> 19:58.880
You really don't get it, do you?

19:59.080 --> 20:01.180
I would never betray
my brothers-in-arms.

20:01.380 --> 20:04.080
Well, thanks to you,
we already know who they are.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.020
We found their
fingerprints in your car.

20:06.220 --> 20:07.320
Ivan Rojas,

20:07.520 --> 20:10.510
Nestor Garcia and your
boyfriend, Miguel Fuentes.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.790
Roxana, you don't owe them
anything.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.030
And I'm guessing
you were already planning

20:16.230 --> 20:17.530
to cut and run, right?

20:17.730 --> 20:19.960
Just take your daddy's cash
and go find some other cause

20:20.160 --> 20:21.300
to add to your
wokeness résumé.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.570
You're wrong again.

20:22.770 --> 20:24.240
I would never go
anywhere without Miguel.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.370
That money was
for the two of us

20:25.570 --> 20:26.600
so we can leave
when this is over.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.310
Well, I got bad news.

20:28.510 --> 20:29.710
It's already over for you.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.790
And it will be for them
too, soon enough.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.710
You'll never stop our plan!

20:34.910 --> 20:36.250
The thieves who have

20:36.450 --> 20:38.280
fleeced our people of their
land for generations,

20:38.480 --> 20:39.830
they will pay.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.220
The girl gave up nothing,

20:44.420 --> 20:46.790
except to say Miguel and
his crew aren't done yet.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.560
So we need to find them
before they attack again.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.060
What do we know
about these two?

20:50.260 --> 20:51.960
STREET:
Well, Ivan Rojas
is Miguel's cousin.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.700
Lived in the same neighborhood
as the Fuentes family.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.070
Dad died young. Single mom

20:56.270 --> 20:57.900
took an early
eminent domain payout

20:58.100 --> 20:59.370
and moved the family
to East L.A.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.640
Car repo.
Apartment eviction.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.710
Looks like they've been
struggling ever since.

21:02.910 --> 21:03.940
Ivan's racked up a jacket

21:04.140 --> 21:06.210
for aggravated assault
and grand larceny.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.650
He's been in and out of jail

21:07.850 --> 21:09.950
on some pretty serious charges.
He's out on parole.

21:10.150 --> 21:11.680
All right, let's reach out to
his mom and his parole officer.

21:11.880 --> 21:12.780
See if they can
give us any insight

21:12.980 --> 21:13.890
on his whereabouts or patterns.

21:14.090 --> 21:15.750
What about
the other guy?

21:15.950 --> 21:17.990
Nestor Garcia.
Childhood friends with Miguel.

21:18.190 --> 21:19.720
Same neighborhood.
Similar story.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.630
Got evicted around the same
time, three years ago.

21:21.830 --> 21:22.830
He's a few years
older than Miguel.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.600
After high school,
he joined the Army.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.100
Worked bomb disposal unit
until he was

21:27.300 --> 21:29.570
dishonorably discharged
for assaulting his C.O.

21:29.770 --> 21:30.970
Since then,

21:31.170 --> 21:32.670
one count of theft,
another for destroying

21:32.870 --> 21:34.410
public property, and so on.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.440
So they each lost their home to
make way for the amphitheater.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.010
So they got an axe to grind.

21:38.210 --> 21:39.710
We need to figure out who
with and that can tell us

21:39.910 --> 21:41.750
where they're headed next.
We sent protective details

21:41.950 --> 21:43.950
to the land developers'
office and notified

21:44.150 --> 21:45.620
the sheriff's deputies
who enforced the evictions

21:45.820 --> 21:47.290
to be on alert.

21:47.490 --> 21:48.490
As for where
Miguel and his crew

21:48.690 --> 21:50.150
are going next,
we're working it, sir.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.190
We need to work it harder.
There's too much at stake here.

21:52.390 --> 21:53.330
I need these guys

21:53.530 --> 21:55.810
found yesterday.
Yes, sir.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.830
Ah, I see you're
still here, Commander.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.600
Yeah, I still got
a lot going on, Doc.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.100
Can you get a
five-minute break?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.540
Because I have an espresso
machine in my office.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.010
And I can make you a latte.

22:08.210 --> 22:09.640
Yeah, I'm not falling for that.
I'm all right, thanks.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.280
You know, you're
not responsible for

22:11.480 --> 22:14.910
how Miguel Fuentes turned out.
You know that, right?

22:15.110 --> 22:16.630
(sighs)

22:18.230 --> 22:20.650
You know...

22:20.850 --> 22:23.960
99 days out of 100,

22:24.160 --> 22:27.660
I go home knowing that I made
a difference in this city.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.590
But that day,
three years ago?

22:29.790 --> 22:32.460
There was no winning that day.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.800
Even though I didn't
pull the trigger,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.200
I gave the order to put down
Miguel's father

22:37.400 --> 22:38.720
right in front of him.

22:39.850 --> 22:43.010
So... (chuckles)

22:43.210 --> 22:45.910
if I'm not responsible,
then who is?

22:46.110 --> 22:48.210
Why do you get
all the blame?

22:48.410 --> 22:50.080
Surely Ricardo Fuentes,

22:50.280 --> 22:53.790
the man who shot
a sheriff's deputy

22:53.990 --> 22:56.220
and held you at gunpoint,

22:56.420 --> 22:59.820
he bears some responsibility
for what happened.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.860
Good or bad,
we live with our calls.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.600
That's the burden
we bear as cops.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.670
Look, I...

23:07.870 --> 23:11.170
I own my part of what
happened that day.

23:11.370 --> 23:15.270
It's... It's just what happened
afterward that I question.

23:15.470 --> 23:17.340
What do you mean?
Well, I keep asking myself:

23:17.540 --> 23:20.110
does any of this happen if
I would've checked on Miguel

23:20.310 --> 23:21.210
after that day?

23:21.410 --> 23:22.780
If I would've made
more of an effort

23:22.980 --> 23:23.980
to see how he was doing?

23:24.180 --> 23:25.580
Robert, there is
no way to know

23:25.780 --> 23:27.120
if Miguel would've
been better off

23:27.320 --> 23:30.100
if you had done
anything differently.
(sighs)

23:31.210 --> 23:34.130
I saw that boy lose his father.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.900
That sort of trauma, sadly,
I've witnessed too many times.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.360
Certainly enough
that I should've known

23:40.570 --> 23:41.570
where this was going.

23:41.770 --> 23:45.540
Maybe I could've
helped him through it.

23:45.740 --> 23:48.040
Well... at least
I could've tried.

23:48.240 --> 23:53.040
Robert, um, come on,
let's go sit for a moment.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.450
Come on. We can talk.
No.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.280
This was good.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.000
Thanks, Doc.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.960
Oh, damn it.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.590
I thought I had
an angle on Nestor,

24:05.790 --> 24:07.930
but his financials
are a dead end.

24:08.130 --> 24:09.690
Patrol checked his
last known address.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.230
New tenants said he got
evicted a couple months back.

24:12.430 --> 24:14.070
You having any better luck
with Ivan?

24:14.270 --> 24:17.270
Nothing. Even his mother hasn't
seen him in over a month.

24:17.470 --> 24:21.170
It's like these guys, all being
uprooted three years ago...

24:21.370 --> 24:23.040
They just never
really landed again.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.680
Yeah.
Hey, good news.

24:25.880 --> 24:26.940
We got expedited warrants

24:27.140 --> 24:28.180
for the entire crew's
mobile carriers.

24:28.380 --> 24:29.810
Phone data should be
coming through soon.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.220
I'll keep you posted.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.480
We have to.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.450
Yeah. Actually, Tan,

24:34.650 --> 24:36.300
uh, hold up a sec.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.660
There's, uh...

24:40.860 --> 24:42.760
There's something we
got to tell you.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.200
What's up?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.700
You the one who's been stealing

24:45.900 --> 24:47.030
my protein drinks
from the fridge?

24:47.230 --> 24:48.430
No.

24:48.630 --> 24:52.470
Tan, last night, I was
at Del Fresco's for dinner,

24:52.670 --> 24:54.790
and I saw Bonnie.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.910
Bonnie was in Atlanta.

24:57.110 --> 24:58.180
Must've been someone who
looked just like her.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.440
It was Bonnie.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.150
And she was there with a guy.

25:01.350 --> 25:04.280
Seemed like they
were on a date.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.720
You messing with me?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.150
He put you up to this?

25:07.350 --> 25:08.690
Because it's not very funny.
STREET: It's not a joke.

25:08.890 --> 25:10.350
Dude, we are so sorry.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.190
We just figured
you'd want to know.

25:12.390 --> 25:14.430
That you think my wife
is cheating on me?

25:14.630 --> 25:15.930
Like I said, we're sorry.

25:16.130 --> 25:17.600
If you don't believe me,
ask her.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.800
Ask Bonnie where
she was last night.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.200
I will. And she'll tell me

25:20.400 --> 25:21.900
that she was in Atlanta,
on business.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.300
Okay, then she'd be lying.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.700
Tan, we're just trying
to look out for you.

25:24.900 --> 25:25.970
I know it's complicated.

25:26.170 --> 25:27.400
What? You get with Chris,

25:27.610 --> 25:28.570
all of a sudden you're
a relationship expert?

25:28.770 --> 25:29.910
And you, Cabrera.

25:30.110 --> 25:31.480
Why don't you figure out
your own disaster

25:31.680 --> 25:34.380
of a love life before you
start interfering in mine.

25:34.580 --> 25:36.300
Tan...

25:39.900 --> 25:41.790
Roxana's phone.

25:41.990 --> 25:44.060
Sir, are you sure
this is a good idea?

25:44.260 --> 25:45.760
Miguel's got to be
wondering where Roxana is.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.560
He might figure she's
been scooped up by now.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.860
And maybe he won't pick up,
but it's worth a try.

25:50.060 --> 25:51.560
We need to know
where these guys are.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.870
Now, is Cabrera ready to
triangulate his location?

25:54.070 --> 25:56.130
She is. But all due respect,

25:56.330 --> 25:58.520
Commander, I think you're
too close to this one.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.610
July.

26:00.810 --> 26:01.740
That was the safe word

26:01.940 --> 26:02.970
I used to take the kill shot

26:03.170 --> 26:04.480
that set this whole thing
in motion.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.290
So, you're damn right
I'm too close to this one.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.300
That's why I have to
make this call.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.200
(phone ringing)

26:15.170 --> 26:17.450
Roxy, where you been?

26:17.660 --> 26:18.720
We're almost ready.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.260
Roxana?

26:20.460 --> 26:21.830
Miguel.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.490
This is Commander
Robert Hicks, LAPD SWAT.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.660
Do you remember me?

26:25.860 --> 26:28.200
Yeah. How can I forget?

26:28.400 --> 26:30.130
What do you want, Commander?

26:30.330 --> 26:31.540
HICKS: Well, I was
hoping we could talk.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.140
Yeah, like you talked to my dad?
I don't think so.

26:34.340 --> 26:37.110
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt, Miguel,

26:37.310 --> 26:38.280
and that includes you.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.080
Now, you weren't
responsible

26:40.280 --> 26:41.850
for any of what happened
three years ago.

26:42.050 --> 26:43.920
But this, what you're doing now?

26:44.120 --> 26:46.550
It's wrong.
And it's got to stop.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.290
Nah. There's no stopping it.

26:48.490 --> 26:49.990
HICKS: I'm trying to
help you here, Miguel.

26:50.190 --> 26:52.790
No. I ain't the same kid
I was back then, okay?

26:52.990 --> 26:55.260
You can't trick me again.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.540
All right, okay.

26:57.610 --> 26:59.700
Okay, all right. Fine.

26:59.900 --> 27:03.800
Then here it is, man to man.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.070
Nothing you do can bring back
what you lost three years ago.

27:08.270 --> 27:09.840
But you still have
a little sister

27:10.040 --> 27:11.510
and a mother who love you.

27:11.710 --> 27:12.940
Turn yourself in.

27:13.140 --> 27:14.810
Stop this now,

27:15.010 --> 27:16.660
before you lose them, too.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.980
You're right.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.090
I can never change
what happened to my family.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.550
But I can make the people
who ruined our lives

27:23.760 --> 27:26.110
pay for what they did.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.280
I lost him.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.450
Hey! Hurry up!

27:33.880 --> 27:36.400
Cabrera, tell
me you got him.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.640
Call pinged off a cell
tower in Hollywood.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.170
Didn't last long enough
to pin an exact spot.

27:40.370 --> 27:41.940
LUCA:
Intel just came in
from Ivan Rojas's

27:42.140 --> 27:44.310
mobile carrier.
Got all of his metadata,

27:44.510 --> 27:45.540
including
location history.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.280
This guy gets around.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.680
But there are a couple
areas he kept going back to

27:48.880 --> 27:50.380
over the last two
weeks, spending time,

27:50.580 --> 27:52.620
including the Crescenta
Amphitheatre construction site.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.820
So you're thinking these are
locations he was casing.

27:55.020 --> 27:56.350
Anything up
around Hollywood?

27:56.550 --> 27:58.360
Just one. Up off
Laurel Canyon.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.830
Get me property details on
homes near that location.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.960
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That one.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.000
Chip Jenkins. He's
a city councilman.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.010
I was reading up on
the Fuentes case earlier.

28:07.850 --> 28:10.300
Jenkins was there
talking down protesters

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
at the Fuentes standoff
three years ago.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.440
It goes deeper than that.
Jenkins is the one

28:14.640 --> 28:15.670
who proposed
the eminent domain plan

28:15.870 --> 28:17.010
to clear out the residents

28:17.210 --> 28:18.280
and build a concert venue.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.380
He signed off
on the whole thing.

28:19.580 --> 28:20.780
He's got to be
their next target.

28:20.980 --> 28:21.650
All right, get
over there now.

28:21.850 --> 28:22.650
I'll call ahead.

28:22.850 --> 28:23.980
(dialing)

28:24.180 --> 28:26.370
* *

28:48.060 --> 28:50.440
Madeline, we don't have
money in the budget

28:50.640 --> 28:52.440
for road improvements

28:52.640 --> 28:54.150
in your district. We could...

28:54.350 --> 28:56.410
(buzzing)
issue a series
of obligation bonds,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.300
uh, in the interim...

28:58.970 --> 29:01.870
Hey, get out! What
are you guys doing?!

29:03.300 --> 29:04.740
What do you want?

29:05.670 --> 29:06.960
What do you
want from me?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.360
Shut up!

29:08.560 --> 29:09.460
I-I have money.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.600
Shut your mouth!

29:11.800 --> 29:14.200
(tires screech)

29:14.400 --> 29:16.780
* *

29:19.090 --> 29:20.570
Could be the ride Miguel
and his crew took.

29:20.770 --> 29:22.510
And it looks like
Jenkins is home.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.960
We got to get inside. Let's go.

29:27.430 --> 29:28.910
Just tell me what you want.
I can help you.

29:29.110 --> 29:31.720
I've got like 20 grand
in my safe, plus watches.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.520
The combination is, is 4412.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.020
In the bedroom.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.060
You can take 'em,
take 'em and go.

29:39.260 --> 29:40.320
Oh, we'll take 'em.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.360
But there's no buying your
way out of this one.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.260
Not after you stole our land

29:43.460 --> 29:44.880
and destroyed our families.

29:45.610 --> 29:48.270
Wait, you guys are the
ones that killed the guard

29:48.470 --> 29:49.830
at the construction
site this morning.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.070
Construction site?

29:51.270 --> 29:52.600
Hey, that was our
neighborhood.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.370
We lost everything
because of you. Everything!

29:54.570 --> 29:55.610
Now it's time you feel

29:55.810 --> 29:57.940
that same pain.
Look, I'm sorry.

29:58.140 --> 29:59.380
I was just
doing my job.

29:59.580 --> 30:00.790
Everything I did
was legal.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.680
(screams)

30:03.880 --> 30:06.000
Just 'cause it's legal
doesn't make it right.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.070
To the safe, man. Go.

30:10.370 --> 30:11.460
You all smelling that?

30:11.660 --> 30:12.920
It's gasoline.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.660
They must be
dousing the place.

30:14.860 --> 30:17.230
The Fuentes standoff ended with
the house on fire, didn't it?

30:17.430 --> 30:19.560
They're gonna do the same to
this place, with Jenkins inside.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.970
Tan, Stevens, take
the three side,

30:22.170 --> 30:23.800
cover the back
for egress.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.850
We got no time to negotiate.
Got to get in there.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.160
Get the door-cracker.

30:32.690 --> 30:33.580
(beeps)
(lock snaps)

30:33.780 --> 30:35.800
Covert entry.

30:36.700 --> 30:37.750
Shallow to deep, on me.

30:37.950 --> 30:38.750
We got you covered, Luca.

30:38.950 --> 30:40.970
Three. Two. One. Breach.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.690
Please don't.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.520
Please don't. Please...

30:46.720 --> 30:47.990
You're right!

30:48.190 --> 30:51.130
Okay? I screwed
your neighborhood over!

30:51.330 --> 30:52.630
I'm sorry, but
please don't do this!

30:52.830 --> 30:54.570
I can fix this if you let me go!

30:54.770 --> 30:56.630
It's too late
for apologies.

30:56.830 --> 30:58.390
(muffled shouting)

30:59.690 --> 31:01.390
(whistles)

31:01.620 --> 31:03.020
(grunts)

31:04.090 --> 31:05.080
Ivan?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.140
(groaning)

31:06.340 --> 31:07.690
Ivan?

31:08.500 --> 31:11.030
(Ivan groaning)

31:12.800 --> 31:13.680
(grunts)

31:13.880 --> 31:14.720
Over, on your side.

31:14.920 --> 31:15.720
Give me your hand.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.140
Give me your other hand.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.160
LAPD!

31:19.360 --> 31:20.370
Hands in the air!

31:22.940 --> 31:25.080
Bathroom only, clear.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.350
CABRERA:
Master bedroom, clear.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.800
25-David. One suspect down
on the three side.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.110
It's Nestor Garcia.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.910
Okay, I got Ivan Rojas
here with me.

31:37.110 --> 31:38.240
STREET:
26-David.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.680
House is clear.
We checked everywhere.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.750
Tan, Stevens, any sign
of Miguel?

31:41.950 --> 31:42.750
STEVENS:
Negative on the perimeter.

31:42.950 --> 31:43.850
He's not here.

31:44.050 --> 31:45.520
CABRERA:
Maybe he never was.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.820
Where's Miguel?

31:47.020 --> 31:50.200
Hey! Where's Miguel?

31:51.740 --> 31:52.920
22-David to Command.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.560
One suspect down,
one suspect in custody.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.690
Councilman Jenkins
is safe.

31:56.890 --> 31:58.810
Show us Code 4.

31:59.610 --> 32:00.830
Any sign of him?

32:01.030 --> 32:02.200
No. Looks like Miguel's
gone to ground.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.800
His mother Lupe
received a text

32:04.000 --> 32:05.420
from a burner phone
about a half an hour ago.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.310
HICKS:
"Leaving town. This is
all for our family.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.370
I hope you understand."

32:09.570 --> 32:10.370
LUCA:
Yeah, burner last pinged

32:10.570 --> 32:11.310
towers around Torrance

32:11.510 --> 32:12.440
and then it went dead.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.010
Could be fleeing
to a distant hideout.

32:14.210 --> 32:15.110
Even south
to the border.

32:15.310 --> 32:16.750
I guess it's easy
to have ideals

32:16.950 --> 32:19.220
when you're willing to let your
comrades take the fall for you.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.650
Well, a BOLO's
out on Miguel.

32:20.850 --> 32:22.020
We're all hands
on the manhunt.

32:22.220 --> 32:23.450
And U.S. Customs
has been notified

32:23.650 --> 32:24.890
in case he tries to
cross into Mexico.

32:25.090 --> 32:26.090
HICKS:
All right.

32:26.290 --> 32:27.490
Commander.

32:27.690 --> 32:28.990
You've been working for
almost 36 hours straight.

32:29.190 --> 32:30.660
I know you want to
see this one through,

32:30.860 --> 32:32.930
but we can take
it from here.

32:33.130 --> 32:34.770
I was just hoping we could
wrap this one up today.

32:34.970 --> 32:36.000
You know, get some closure.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.940
We saved lives
today, Commander.

32:38.140 --> 32:40.290
Miguel will turn
up eventually.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.390
And when he does,
I'm your first call.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.530
(classical music playing)

33:06.730 --> 33:07.950
(Hicks sighs)

33:16.460 --> 33:17.990
(sighs)

33:18.990 --> 33:20.040
(phone buzzing)

33:20.240 --> 33:20.910
Mm.

33:21.110 --> 33:22.680
You got something?

33:22.880 --> 33:25.180
HONDO: No, sir. Just calling to
let you know that we tagged out

33:25.380 --> 33:27.050
with 50-Squad. They're
gonna take it from here

33:27.250 --> 33:29.590
until 20-Squad's back
on duty tomorrow.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.060
Daniel...

33:31.260 --> 33:33.020
I know we haven't talked
since last July,

33:33.220 --> 33:34.980
but I'm gonna have
to call you back.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.450
Daniel...?

33:39.450 --> 33:40.400
July.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.630
(siren wailing)

33:41.830 --> 33:43.880
(tires screeching)

33:44.890 --> 33:46.840
This is 20-David to Dispatch.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.410
I'm responding
to a home invasion.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.740
The hostage is
Commander Robert Hicks.

33:50.940 --> 33:53.030
Send backup now.

33:57.830 --> 33:58.850
You didn't think I'd leave

33:59.050 --> 34:00.450
without finishing
the job, did you?

34:00.650 --> 34:04.520
All day... people have been
trying to convince me

34:04.720 --> 34:06.990
that none of this
was my fault.

34:07.190 --> 34:10.630
I guess you and I are the
only ones on the same page.

34:10.830 --> 34:11.900
Hey, man,
don't flatter yourself.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.560
You're just part
of a bigger problem.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.830
There's no cameras
here, Miguel.

34:16.030 --> 34:16.900
There's no...

34:17.100 --> 34:18.200
There's no audience
to preach to.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.340
Just you and me.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.510
So let me do the one thing

34:22.710 --> 34:24.440
that I should've done
three years ago.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.460
And what's that?

34:27.330 --> 34:28.880
Apologize to you.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.120
I'm sorry, kid.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.750
I'm sorry for what happened
to your family's land.

34:33.950 --> 34:37.520
I'm sorry for the violence
that you witnessed that day.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.720
I'm sorry that no one
was there for you after.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.110
Especially me.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.410
No!

34:45.610 --> 34:47.060
I don't want your
damn apologies!

34:47.260 --> 34:49.170
I want my family back!

34:49.370 --> 34:50.950
(sobbing)

34:51.790 --> 34:53.120
(big band music playing)

34:57.290 --> 35:00.060
It's gonna take a lot more
than that, old man!

35:09.540 --> 35:11.540
You can't hide forever!

35:16.410 --> 35:18.650
* *

35:23.120 --> 35:24.070
(gunfire)

35:24.270 --> 35:27.650
(grunting)

35:45.710 --> 35:47.610
(screaming)

35:50.580 --> 35:51.910
(grunting)

36:01.050 --> 36:03.070
(grunting)

36:03.270 --> 36:04.960
No!

36:05.930 --> 36:06.540
LAPD!

36:06.740 --> 36:07.980
Commander! Call out!

36:08.180 --> 36:09.250
Out here!

36:09.450 --> 36:11.520
No.
Give it up, Miguel.
It's over.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.320
I lost everything!

36:13.520 --> 36:14.790
Not everything.
Not yet, son.

36:14.990 --> 36:16.520
I got him, Commander.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.790
On your stomach,
hands behind your head.

36:17.990 --> 36:19.290
Put 'em behind
your head, come on.

36:19.490 --> 36:21.560
No.
Come on, come on.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.530
All right. All right.

36:23.730 --> 36:25.060
Take him.

36:25.260 --> 36:26.160
OFFICER:
Stand up.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.400
Sweep the rest of the house.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.400
HICKS:
There's no one else.

36:28.600 --> 36:29.850
It's clear.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.790
(sighs)

36:34.720 --> 36:36.210
Looks like you still
got it, Commander.

36:36.410 --> 36:37.610
(chuckles)

36:37.810 --> 36:39.630
(deep exhale)

36:40.460 --> 36:42.700
* *

36:51.070 --> 36:52.120
Hey.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.090
CABRERA:
I thought you left
a while ago.

36:54.290 --> 36:55.490
You want to get in on this?

36:55.690 --> 36:58.630
Assuming, of course, you throw
your punches at the pads

36:58.830 --> 37:00.080
and not at us.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.880
I think I'm afraid to go home.

37:04.350 --> 37:05.200
Truth is, uh...

37:05.400 --> 37:06.770
something's been off between

37:06.970 --> 37:08.540
Bonnie and me for a while.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.310
I've been ignoring it,

37:10.510 --> 37:11.810
pretending everything's okay.

37:12.010 --> 37:13.210
That's why I snapped
at you guys earlier.

37:13.410 --> 37:14.210
You didn't deserve that.

37:14.410 --> 37:16.050
No, man, we understand.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.110
We're just...

37:18.320 --> 37:19.330
We're sorry.

37:20.930 --> 37:23.620
If I ask Bonnie where she
was last night, either...

37:23.820 --> 37:25.660
she lies or...
Or...

37:25.860 --> 37:27.610
the truth is even worse.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.210
It feels like I lose either way.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.100
But, uh...

37:35.300 --> 37:37.180
I guess there's
no putting it off.

37:38.220 --> 37:39.870
We're here for you.

37:40.070 --> 37:42.410
Whatever happens.
Yeah.

37:42.610 --> 37:44.220
Thanks.

37:50.030 --> 37:53.030
(ringing)

37:57.570 --> 37:58.720
This is Dr. Hughes.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.590
HICKS:
Oh, hey, Doc.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.230
Oh, hi, Commander.

38:02.430 --> 38:03.730
I didn't think
you'd still be there.

38:03.930 --> 38:05.800
I figured
I'd be leaving a message.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.800
WENDY:
I got a lot

38:07.000 --> 38:08.030
going on, Commander.

38:08.230 --> 38:09.330
Hmm.

38:09.530 --> 38:11.540
Well, I just wanted
to call to tell you

38:11.740 --> 38:15.910
that the Miguel Fuentes
situation has been resolved.

38:16.110 --> 38:17.840
Yeah?

38:18.040 --> 38:19.110
You want to talk about it?

38:19.310 --> 38:21.410
(chuckles)

38:21.610 --> 38:23.580
Uh, well...

38:23.780 --> 38:26.900
I mean, Molly's on her way over
to check on me and...

38:30.600 --> 38:31.620
I got a little time

38:31.820 --> 38:33.260
before she gets here, so, yeah.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.880
Sure. Why not?

38:37.310 --> 38:38.560
(door opens)

38:38.760 --> 38:39.560
BONNIE:
Hey.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.060
There you are.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.700
I got you chicken vindaloo,
extra spicy,

38:43.900 --> 38:47.120
and a side of naan.
Want me to warm it up?

38:48.890 --> 38:50.790
What's wrong?
Did you already eat?

38:51.990 --> 38:53.890
Where were you last night?

38:55.700 --> 38:56.580
Why?

38:56.780 --> 38:58.250
Were you in Atlanta?

38:58.450 --> 39:00.100
Or were you here in L.A.?

39:01.070 --> 39:02.450
Victor, I don't understand.

39:02.650 --> 39:03.890
Be straight with me, Bonnie.

39:04.090 --> 39:05.270
You owe me that much.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.780
Where were you?

39:10.740 --> 39:13.710
I was here, in L.A.

39:15.980 --> 39:17.170
Who were you with?

39:17.370 --> 39:19.390
Does he have a name?

39:20.190 --> 39:22.240
How long has it been going on?

39:22.440 --> 39:23.710
Victor...

39:23.910 --> 39:25.260
How long?

39:27.490 --> 39:28.760
Six months.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.620
(scoffs)

39:34.820 --> 39:36.550
Who is he?

39:36.750 --> 39:37.590
Do I know him?

39:37.790 --> 39:41.480
No. I met him through work.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.330
You in love with him?

39:44.530 --> 39:46.860
No. I don't...

39:47.060 --> 39:49.300
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.670
I didn't mean to...

39:50.870 --> 39:52.000
Were you ever gonna tell me?

39:52.200 --> 39:54.920
I was waiting
for the right time.

39:56.690 --> 39:58.740
We've been growing apart.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.750
Living in-in different cities.

40:01.950 --> 40:04.050
You're so busy with SWAT
all the time...

40:04.250 --> 40:07.450
No, do-do not make this
about me or my job.

40:07.650 --> 40:09.220
I've shown up for you.

40:09.420 --> 40:11.590
I've been there for you,
every step of the way.

40:11.790 --> 40:14.070
I've supported you
in your career.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.690
And you pay me back
by-by cheating on me?

40:16.890 --> 40:17.930
Making me look
like a fool?

40:18.130 --> 40:19.660
You do not get to blame me.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.350
Or make me into the bad guy.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.850
I'm sorry.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.540
Get out. Just get
the hell out.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.610
Where am I supposed to go?

40:30.810 --> 40:33.380
I don't care. Just leave.

40:33.580 --> 40:35.130
Better yet, go to him.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.220
(drawer opens)

40:42.420 --> 40:45.290
(keys jingling)
(drawer closes)

40:45.490 --> 40:47.090
Victor...
Bonnie.

40:47.290 --> 40:49.980
Get out now.
