<i>Pearl: Ugh! This isn't
getting us anywhere!</i>

00:06.541 --> 00:08.352
What's the matter, perogie?
You tired?

00:08.386 --> 00:10.821
I don't get tired. I get results.

00:13.258 --> 00:14.625
[Gurgling]

00:14.659 --> 00:17.861
Was the sign for "pull me up"
one wiggle or two?

00:17.929 --> 00:19.663
Amethyst, stay focused.

00:20.465 --> 00:22.566
For all we know, Lapis
and Jasper's fusion

00:22.600 --> 00:25.936
could be right under our noses.
[Gasps]

00:26.110 --> 00:28.678
[Spits]
This is why we wear life jackets.

00:28.713 --> 00:33.183
- Are ... Are you all right?
- Huh. Nothing.

00:33.217 --> 00:35.252
[Gurgling]

00:35.286 --> 00:38.555
Oh, it feels like we've been
searching for light years.

00:38.589 --> 00:42.827
Uh, light years measures light.
[Gags] Not years.

00:42.862 --> 00:43.627
[Groans]

00:43.661 --> 00:46.930
And I'm sick of these... life diapers.

00:46.964 --> 00:51.401
- Safety is no punch line, Pearl.
- Safety is our job.

00:51.436 --> 00:54.504
We must find Jasper and Lapis.
As it stands,

00:54.539 --> 00:58.842
- their fusion is a ticking time bomb.
- Is Lapis gonna be okay?

00:58.876 --> 01:02.129
She had control when she
used her power to drag their

01:02.130 --> 01:05.382
fusion into the ocean, but a
fusion like theirs is unstable,

01:05.450 --> 01:08.218
bound together by anger and mistrust.

01:08.252 --> 01:12.422
If that bond snaps, their anger
will take over and destroy.

01:12.457 --> 01:14.791
Don't worry, Lapis.

01:14.826 --> 01:17.961
<i>We won't let you sleep
with the fishes. [Yawns]</i>

01:18.029 --> 01:20.564
We're gonna have to keep looking.

01:20.598 --> 01:24.835
- But first, let's bring Steven home.
- Huh? What? Wha?

01:24.869 --> 01:27.337
No. I'm ... I'm ... I'm fine.

01:27.371 --> 01:28.872
Let's ... Let's go fishing.

01:28.906 --> 01:33.443
- First one to catch something wins.
- I win.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.779
<i>Pearl: We should be out there searching,</i>

01:35.813 --> 01:38.248
not in here not searching.

01:38.282 --> 01:42.519
"Sleep is a curse, and yet
a curse I need to live."

01:42.553 --> 01:43.720
Steven Universe.

01:43.754 --> 01:46.690
Steven isn't like us.
He needs rest.

01:46.724 --> 01:50.360
Don't you guys need rest, too?
You look exhausted.

01:50.394 --> 01:53.063
We look awesome.

01:53.097 --> 01:56.666
Look, you can't really
knock sleep until you try it.

01:56.701 --> 01:59.469
And maybe we can throw
a little fun into the mix

01:59.504 --> 02:03.406
- with a slumber party!
- F-Fun?

02:03.441 --> 02:06.409
Yeah. All of us together,
peacefully dozing off.

02:06.444 --> 02:07.844
It'll be like there isn't

02:07.879 --> 02:10.714
a vengeful fusion boiling
the ocean with hatred.

02:10.747 --> 02:12.148
Steven's right.

02:12.183 --> 02:14.618
You should stay here
and relax, but I'm going.

02:14.652 --> 02:16.920
'Cause I'm always relaxed.

02:16.954 --> 02:22.092
But Garnet, you couldn't possibly
search the ocean by yourself.

02:22.126 --> 02:24.594
Let me ... let us help you.

02:24.629 --> 02:27.063
- We're a team!
- No.

02:27.098 --> 02:29.966
Right now, you're a party ...
a slumber party.

02:30.001 --> 02:33.537
Steven, put these Gems to bed.
Don't stay up too late.

02:33.571 --> 02:37.140
There's snacks in the fridge.
Bye.

02:37.174 --> 02:39.676
Now, before we get this
slumber party started,

02:39.710 --> 02:42.412
would either of you care
for a slumber companion?

02:42.446 --> 02:44.960
I'm good.
[Snoring]

02:46.350 --> 02:49.886
- [Hums] Pearl?
- I'll pass on the slumber pals.

02:49.921 --> 02:54.457
- Okay. Sleep it up, then.
- Oh, right.

02:54.492 --> 02:58.328
- Is this right?
- No, you should lay down.

02:58.362 --> 03:01.197
I get it now.

03:01.232 --> 03:04.734
- Am I doing it?
- Well, that's way better than before.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.536
But close your eyes all the way.

03:06.571 --> 03:11.241
Okay. All right.
I'm sleeping now.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.977
- I'm sleeping.
- You can't talk while you sleep.

03:14.011 --> 03:17.647
- How's this even supposed to work?!
- It's easy.

03:17.682 --> 03:22.018
You just lie down, get
nice and comfy, don't move,

03:22.053 --> 03:26.823
and don't think about anything.

03:26.891 --> 03:30.193
<i>Greg: Steven Universe was filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

03:30.227 --> 03:31.328
Oh, my goodness,

03:31.362 --> 03:33.496
Connie's going to be
here any second now.

03:33.531 --> 03:35.899
I can't believe it.
Your first school dance.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.634
Let me just fix your tie and ...

03:37.668 --> 03:39.836
<i>Amethyst: Stop fussing
over Steven like a baby.</i>

03:39.870 --> 03:42.973
Amethyst, what did I tell you
about riding that thing in the house?

03:43.007 --> 03:44.808
Have fun at your dance, dude.

03:44.842 --> 03:46.409
- Oh!
- Bungacowa!

03:46.444 --> 03:49.846
Amethyst, I'm gonna get you!
[Doorbell rings]

03:49.880 --> 03:51.314
Just a second, Connie.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.450
You won't believe what
Amethyst just ... huh?

03:53.517 --> 03:55.518
[Cheers and applause]

03:55.553 --> 04:01.458
- Can I help you?
- Chille tid.

04:01.525 --> 04:03.627
- Oh, hi, Garnet.
- Hey, Steven.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.362
You got to come to the beach tonight.

04:05.396 --> 04:07.797
There's gonna be this
huge bonfire party thing.

04:07.832 --> 04:11.901
I can't go to that.
I'm going to the big dance with Connie.

04:11.936 --> 04:16.541
Wow. "The big dance."
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

04:16.577 --> 04:17.668
[Cheers and applause]

04:17.704 --> 04:19.743
Well ... [doorbell rings]
[Gasps] She's here!

04:19.777 --> 04:25.081
Okay, I'm ready for the big dance Con...
Huh?

04:25.116 --> 04:27.250
Lapis?

04:31.856 --> 04:33.523
[Grunts]
Are you okay?

04:33.591 --> 04:36.026
Ah! Ugh! Oh, man...

04:36.060 --> 04:38.828
I feel asleep and had this weird dream.

04:38.896 --> 04:41.131
I opened the door and
Lapis was there, and ...

04:41.165 --> 04:42.999
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.935
Lapis is fused with Jasper
at the bottom of the ocean.

04:46.003 --> 04:50.940
- You've never had a dream before, huh?
- Uh... I don't think so.

04:50.975 --> 04:54.611
Well, Pearl, dreams
don't always make sense.

04:54.645 --> 04:56.646
When you dream, the
thoughts in your head

04:56.681 --> 04:58.581
get all mixed up into a weird movie.

04:58.616 --> 05:00.216
And they're really hard to explain,

05:00.251 --> 05:02.819
which is why they're
boring to listen to.

05:02.853 --> 05:04.688
Like [sighs]
this one time,

05:04.722 --> 05:07.057
I had a dream where, like, these things

05:07.091 --> 05:09.325
<i>were being sold at the Big Donut, right?</i>

05:09.360 --> 05:11.795
<i>But the front door of the Big Donut shop</i>

05:11.829 --> 05:15.765
<i>led to the back of my dad's van.
So, I go into the van,</i>

05:15.800 --> 05:19.602
<i>and lion is driving
for some reason, but...</i>

05:19.637 --> 05:20.670
[Yawns]

05:20.705 --> 05:22.806
<i>...he's driving really well.</i>

05:22.840 --> 05:26.443
<i>And ... and then I say
to him, I says, "lion ..."</i>

05:26.477 --> 05:27.777
[Yawns]

05:27.812 --> 05:31.915
"lion, how did you learn
to drive you a v-van?

05:31.949 --> 05:33.283
You can't even...

05:33.317 --> 05:39.289
you... you can't bring...
me... my...

05:40.674 --> 05:43.576
Whoo!
[Laughs]

05:43.611 --> 05:45.078
[Gasps]
Dogcopter!

05:45.112 --> 05:48.014
Mr. Copter, sir, I'm
one of your biggest fans!

05:48.048 --> 05:50.383
Can I please have your autograph?

05:50.417 --> 05:51.818
[Meows]

05:51.852 --> 05:55.421
Mr. Copter, please ...
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

05:55.456 --> 06:00.193
I hope the rumors about Dogcopter
in the tabloids aren't true.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.762
Huh? Oh, hey, Pearl!

06:02.796 --> 06:04.564
Wait... don't eat me!

06:04.598 --> 06:05.999
[Chomp!]

06:06.033 --> 06:07.667
Ptoo!
Ooh! Oh, man.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.869
Thanks for the upgrade, Pearl!

06:09.904 --> 06:15.575
Now I can catch up with Dog...
Whoa. Amethyst?

06:15.643 --> 06:18.912
Hmm.
This is getting really weird.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.682
- Lapis: This is weird.
- Hey, that sounds a lot like ...

06:22.750 --> 06:25.251
- Steven!
- Lapis Lazuli!

06:25.319 --> 06:28.087
Steven, wh-what are you doing in here?

06:28.122 --> 06:31.190
Uh, I know it's weird,
but I'm just dreaming,

06:31.225 --> 06:33.993
- so don't even worry about it.
- What? No!

06:34.061 --> 06:36.296
Steven, I'm trying to concentrate.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.231
[Gasps]
How are you here?

06:38.265 --> 06:41.935
- Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?
- Steven, please, I ...

06:41.969 --> 06:44.871
[Warbling, laughing]

06:44.905 --> 06:46.005
[Amethyst laughing]

06:46.073 --> 06:47.607
Ugh... [gasps]
Lapis!

06:47.641 --> 06:52.712
Amethyst?
Hey, what are you laughing at?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.681
[Pearl laughing]

06:54.715 --> 06:57.550
<i>Oh, Rose! This is wonderful!</i>

06:57.584 --> 07:01.621
I'm just having so much fun
spending time with you, Rose!

07:01.655 --> 07:05.258
Forget about Greg.
Let's go travel the galaxy!

07:05.292 --> 07:10.697
<i>Pearl, thank you so much...
for fixing my van!</i>

07:10.731 --> 07:13.833
- Oh! Ugh!
- Blegh...

07:13.901 --> 07:14.901
Gah!

07:14.935 --> 07:17.870
[Mumbling]
[chuckles]

07:17.905 --> 07:22.041
- Pearl?
- Uh... yes, Steven?

07:22.076 --> 07:24.477
I had another dream about Lapis.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.447
Oh... that's okay!
Dreams aren't real!

07:27.481 --> 07:29.949
They're just mixed-up movies!

07:30.017 --> 07:35.188
- But I ... I think I was talking to her.
- Wait. How do you know?

07:35.222 --> 07:37.557
I don't, but I could just feel it.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.593
She was yelling,
and she was really freaked out.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.563
What did she say?
Is she still in control?

07:43.597 --> 07:45.965
I... I don't know.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.037
Steven, you could be using your dreams
to connect with her mentally.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.305
Can you do it again?

07:52.339 --> 07:55.174
Maybe Lapis can just
tell you where they are.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.243
I guess I have to go back to sleep.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.847
Quick, Pearl, tell me about
your dream so I can fall asleep.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.181
M-My dream?

08:02.216 --> 08:05.118
Come on, Pearl!
It's for the greater good!

08:05.185 --> 08:07.487
- Ha, ha! [Sighs]
- If I must.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.989
[Inhales sharply]
So, in my dream, I was ...

08:10.024 --> 08:16.162
- [Steven snoring] What?
- [Laughs] Wow! He been sleep.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.033
Oh! I know this is a dream now,

08:20.067 --> 08:23.136
so I can imagine anything I want.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.805
Uh... mashed potato.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.075
Hmm.
Now how do I find Lapis?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.310
Not Lapis.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.811
Not Lapis.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.446
Not Lapis.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.280
Ugh! Lion?

08:35.315 --> 08:38.985
Wait. You're not lion.
Whoa!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.186
Aah! Ugh!

08:40.220 --> 08:42.722
Ow. What is this place?

08:42.756 --> 08:46.092
- [Groaning] Lapis!
- Steven!

08:46.126 --> 08:49.896
Why do you keep coming back?
I can't get distracted!

08:49.930 --> 08:53.566
I-I've got to hold us down with
the weight of your planet's ocean.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.968
[Straining]
I've got to keep her...

08:56.036 --> 08:57.170
[Groans]

08:57.204 --> 09:00.873
Wait, Lapis, tell me where you are.
We can help you.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.341
[Grunts]

09:02.409 --> 09:04.911
I told you! No!

09:04.978 --> 09:06.712
Aah!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.848
[Gasps]

09:08.882 --> 09:11.451
[Breathing heavily]

09:11.485 --> 09:15.788
- You!
- Jasper!

09:15.823 --> 09:17.723
You!

09:17.758 --> 09:22.528
You! You!
Gaah! [Grunts]

09:22.563 --> 09:25.832
Ohh! No!

09:25.866 --> 09:26.933
[Gasps]

09:26.967 --> 09:29.235
- Lapis!
- Can't you see?

09:29.269 --> 09:33.640
I can't stop, not for a second.
Don't look for me.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.142
- I don't want your help.
- B-But ...

09:36.176 --> 09:38.010
Just let me do this for you!

09:38.045 --> 09:42.248
- Lapis...
- No! I'm not Lapis anymore.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.586
<i>We're Malachite now.</i>

09:46.620 --> 09:49.655
Lapis, no!
[Chains rattling]

09:52.459 --> 09:53.659
[Gasps]

09:53.694 --> 09:56.596
<i>Oooragh!</i>

10:00.467 --> 10:01.534
<i>Go!</i>

10:01.568 --> 10:03.369
Lapis!
[Breathes heavily]

10:03.403 --> 10:05.738
Steven, it's okay.
We're here.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.600
- Did you see her?
- Yeah. She's still fused.

10:09.890 --> 10:12.851
And she's still in control,
but I don't know for how long.

10:13.349 --> 10:15.717
And ...
[footsteps approaching]

10:15.751 --> 10:19.087
- This is a weird party.
- Garnet! Mm.

10:19.155 --> 10:22.657
- Steven, you're still awake.
- Amethyst was on a skateboard.

10:22.691 --> 10:25.026
And then Dogcopter meowed at me

10:25.060 --> 10:26.928
and was just not interested
in what I had to say at all!

10:26.996 --> 10:29.430
And I might have some
issues I need to work out...

10:29.465 --> 10:31.132
but Lapis, she's out
there, and she's still ...

10:31.200 --> 10:34.335
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I know you're worried,

10:34.370 --> 10:36.704
but there's nothing we can do right now.

10:36.739 --> 10:38.959
So let's take it easy.
[Grunts]

10:39.047 --> 10:41.993
I'll show you how it's done.

10:43.325 --> 10:46.514
- That's pretty convincing.
- Garnet?
