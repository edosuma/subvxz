00:03.900 --> 00:09.800
Once upon a time, there was a guy
with the improbable name of Fox Mulder.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.800
He started out life happily
enough, as these things go.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.900
He had parents who loved him,
a cute kid sister.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.600
He had a roof over his head, got all his
flu shots, had all his fingers and toes...

00:20.600 --> 00:27.200
...and aside from being stuck with the name "Fox"
which probably taught him how to fight-- or not--

00:27.200 --> 00:30.100
...he pretty much led a normal life.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.900
But the worst thing by far, the biggest kick
in the slacks this kid Fox ever got, ...

00:34.900 --> 00:41.100
...was what happened to his sister.
One day, she just disappeared.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.300
Now, Fox buckled down and worked his butt off.
Graduated top of his class at Oxford...

00:47.300 --> 00:53.100
...then top of his class at the FBI academy. None of
that hard work made up for his sister, though.

00:53.100 --> 00:58.400
It was just a way of putting her out of
his mind. Finally, the way I figure it, ...

00:58.400 --> 01:02.100
...he went out of his mind and
he's been that way ever since.

01:02.100 --> 01:07.500
Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career,
lost the respect of supervisors and friends...

01:07.500 --> 01:13.600
...and now lives his life shaking his fist at the sky and
muttering about conspiracies to anyone who will listen.

01:13.600 --> 01:19.000
If you ask me, he's one step away from pushing a
baby carriage filled with tin cans down the street.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.600
But now, all that's going to change.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.700
Tell them the truth,
you lying son of a bitch!

01:58.700 --> 02:01.200
He's not me, Scully!

02:02.800 --> 02:04.400
Scully!

02:04.400 --> 02:07.300
Scully, he's not me!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.800
You hate me now, right?

02:19.700 --> 02:26.200
Dana, I'm sorry I narced on you to Kersh, but I...
I was scared you were going to lose your job.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.900
You did the right thing, Mulder.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.700
I did?

02:31.600 --> 02:36.400
I've been telling you for years you
should play more by the book, haven't I?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.800
Hey, it's the new me.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.200
Hey...

03:06.200 --> 03:10.600
Hey, fellas, take... What about these?
Come on, fellas.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.500
You ain't going nowhere, mibby.

03:18.900 --> 03:24.000
You and me have had our
asses officially disappeared.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.000
Looks like we're up fudge creek.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.600
- Who are you?
- Call sign's Maverick.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.700
Not like I'm going to be
hot-sticking it anytime soon.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.800
- Are you all right, Ma'am?
- "Ma'am?"

03:46.800 --> 03:50.200
Kiss my ass, you desk monkey.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.200
No, no, no. Up, up...

04:04.700 --> 04:07.300
Whew. I am Tiger Woods.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.800
So, what did Kersh say?

04:15.800 --> 04:20.100
He said that I was willful, ...

04:20.100 --> 04:23.500
...insubordinate and not a team player...

04:24.800 --> 04:28.400
...and the FBI didn't need
agents that weren't team players.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.400
What a jerk. Then what?

04:31.400 --> 04:36.300
- Two-week suspension without pay.
- You're not serious.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.200
Who does he think he is?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.600
See you in two weeks.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.300
Dana?

04:47.500 --> 04:52.100
You suppose a home-cooked meal
might ease the pain a little?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.900
Say, at my place 8:00?

05:11.300 --> 05:13.700
Think she likes me, Tiger.

05:14.900 --> 05:21.600
So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears
Rio flying back seat and I'm thinking, ...

05:21.600 --> 05:26.200
"hell, man I'm going to give
this cherry the ride of his life."

05:26.200 --> 05:32.400
So I'm putting the spurs to her, you know? And I'm
doing a little hassling with my wingman, Buzzsaw.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.200
- Now, Buzzsaw...
- Hey, Maverick would you mind?
- Hold up.

05:35.200 --> 05:41.500
Buzzsaw gets on my zero. He's right on my zero.
And when Buzzsaw gets on your zero...

05:41.500 --> 05:44.400
- Maverick...?
- ...he's like a damn dog tick.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.600
- Maverick?
- You ain't shaking that son of a gun.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.100
Hey, Grandma Top Gun, will you shut the hell up?!

05:56.600 --> 06:00.900
You're my bitch now pencil-neck.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.000
General Wegman wants to see you.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.300
Son... You got a set on you.
I'll say that much.

06:25.300 --> 06:30.200
You had us fooled. Why didn't you tell
us what you were doing from the start?

06:30.200 --> 06:31.500
Meaning?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.300
It's the wrong one.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.700
You replaced the flight data
recorder. This one's from...

06:37.700 --> 06:40.700
A scrapped F-111, sir.
It's junk.

06:40.700 --> 06:44.100
You gave the FBI the wrong
flight data recorder. Why?

06:44.100 --> 06:50.800
Morry, if you were running a scam
on the FBI why didn't you let us in on it?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.900
I didn't know if I could trust you.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.800
We have a security leak, gentlemen,
and for all I knew it was one of you.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.500
That's why I decided I should approach
Agent Scully alone to find out who her contact is.

07:05.500 --> 07:10.500
Unfortunately, her partner
Agent Mulder screwed everything up.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.900
So why didn't you tell us all this afterward?

07:12.900 --> 07:17.300
I knew that you wouldn't believe it
until you figured it out for yourself.

07:18.700 --> 07:22.600
So the real flight data recorder is safe?

07:22.600 --> 07:27.100
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
- And you will bring it back?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.600
Of course.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.400
By God, you do got a set on you.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.500
I wish I could say the same
about some of your colleagues.

07:37.500 --> 07:43.100
About those who proffer rumor and innuendo
those who make dangerous accusations.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.200
- Sir, Morris's behavior seemed to...
- You can explain yourself...

07:46.200 --> 07:53.200
...to the review panel in Washington. I've already wired
them recommending censure for your actions.

07:53.900 --> 07:57.500
You're lucky I didn't throw you in the stockade.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.600
A little mood lighting for the bedroom.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.900
No bedroom.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.800
This guy hasn't been laid in ten years.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.900
Hey, Chris. Hey, I like the, uh...

09:30.900 --> 09:34.500
- The, uh... The nose...
- Ouch! As if.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.800
Terry. Buddy. Hey, Terence.
Sorry. How's it going?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.900
Mom says she's taking
out a restraining order on you.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.300
- What are you doing back?
- Joanne...

10:13.300 --> 10:15.900
Your stuff is all outside.
Take it and get out.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.800
Joanne, listen to me. There's
something I got to tell you.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.400
I've heard enough from you
for one lifetime, Morris.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.200
Go tell it to that tramp of
yours, that Scully, whatshername.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.000
Dana Scully- Special Agent Dana Scully.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.800
- Special Tramp Dana Scully.
- She's my partner, Joanne.

10:28.800 --> 10:34.200
- I'm supposed to be your partner.
- My name is not Morris Fletcher. It's Fox Mulder.

10:34.200 --> 10:39.900
Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.
Dana Scully is my FBI partner.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.200
I am not your husband, we are not married,
we are complete strangers and...

10:43.200 --> 10:46.400
...I have a whole other life that
I'm desperately trying to get back to.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.900
You know, Morris, most men when
they have a mid-life crisis...

10:49.900 --> 10:55.500
...they go out and buy themselves a sports car.
They don't run around calling themselves Fox.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.900
I want you to look out the window. Will you just
look out the window with me for a second?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.000
See that car down there?

11:05.100 --> 11:07.000
See the two men in it?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.400
They're surveilling me.
They're spying on me.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.400
I don't know if your husband ever told
you this but he has a very dangerous job...

11:13.400 --> 11:18.000
...and those two men in that car, like you,
think that I'm him only they don't trust me.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.400
So, one false move and I'm history.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.500
Which means that your husband
will also be history because...

11:22.500 --> 11:26.900
...I won't be able to get back and set
things the way they're supposed to be.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.600
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

11:34.700 --> 11:40.300
Morris, if you don't like the man
you've become I don't blame you one bit.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.600
But this flight from
reality isn't the answer.

11:44.900 --> 11:50.100
Accept who you are.
However repulsive that may be.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.800
Perfect timing.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.300
Welcome.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.000
Wow. Mulder.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.800
You like, huh?

12:06.300 --> 12:10.200
Yeah, I thought it was time
I stopped living like a frat boy.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.700
Come on and see the rest of the place.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.500
Over there.

12:26.100 --> 12:30.900
- I didn't even know you had a bedroom.
- Oh, yeah.

12:31.100 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, got to have someplace to lounge around
and read the Sunday New York times, you know.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.000
Uh, no, that's okay. Thanks.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.400
Seriously, just check it out.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.600
Seriously.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.800
Mulder...

12:51.800 --> 12:56.400
Maybe I like to read the
New York Times backwards.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.500
Do you hate it?

12:59.900 --> 13:02.200
No, I don't hate it.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.200
Well, all right then.
Uh, don't go away.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.200
Let's get it on...

13:16.300 --> 13:19.200
Let's get it on...

13:19.300 --> 13:21.000
Let's get it on...

13:21.100 --> 13:27.800
Let's get it on.
Tonight is the night...

13:40.400 --> 13:43.300
Do you know what would really be fun?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.400
What?

13:48.700 --> 13:51.500
Oh, yeah.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.700
- Me first?
- You first.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.400
First time.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.100
Now what?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.500
- You're not Mulder.
- What?

14:14.600 --> 14:18.500
- Baby...
- "Baby" me and you'll be peeing through a catheter.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.500
Your name is Morris Fletcher. It was
Mulder who was arrested in the desert.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.200
He was telling the truth about you.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.600
Now, how do we get things back to normal?

14:31.600 --> 14:36.100
How should I know?
I wouldn't do it even if I could.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.700
You saw my wife. Do you think
I want to go back to that?

14:38.700 --> 14:41.700
Two kids who'd probably kill me
in my sleep for the insurance money.

14:41.700 --> 14:45.600
A $400,000 mortgage on a house
that just appraised at $226,000.

14:45.600 --> 14:51.400
And my job... Yee-gods. You think being
a man in black is all voodoo mind control?

14:51.400 --> 14:54.800
- I can see the paperwork.
- Are you through?

14:55.200 --> 14:59.400
As far as I'm concerned this
thing is a gift from heaven.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.500
Besides, no one is ever going to believe you so
you might as well just get used to me being here.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.800
Or I just shoot you... Baby.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.900
I'm telling you, I have no
idea how to change things back.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.200
What about Mulder's source? The man
he was supposed to meet in the desert?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.800
What about him? Do you know
how to get in touch with him?

15:15.800 --> 15:21.100
I don't know anything about that.
Sorry. You're out of luck.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.400
Hello, hello. I'm very busy
entertaining a *special* guest.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.200
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.900
Agent Mulder, I'm trying
you one last time.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.500
Are you or are you not interested in the
classified information I have to give you?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.700
Please pick up the phone if you're there.

15:39.700 --> 15:44.700
- Mulder.
- Agent Mulder, listen very carefully.

15:56.100 --> 16:00.600
Well, I guess we've given the
neighbors enough to talk about.

16:02.600 --> 16:07.600
For God's sake, Morris at first you couldn't wait to get
away from me and now you won't leave the house.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.500
Where can we go?

16:13.100 --> 16:16.000
- What do you mean?
- You're right.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.700
We should get out of the house.
Go someplace with a lot of people.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.200
Someplace with a lot of people?

16:22.900 --> 16:26.900
- In Rachel, Nevada?
- What do you say?

16:38.900 --> 16:41.600
All right, let's run through this one more time.

16:41.600 --> 16:47.000
I'll go in there alone, just like you told me to.
He'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.900
And?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.100
And if I try and slip out the
back door da-da-da-dee-dee-dee.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.600
Get going.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.800
Can't we start over? You know, do
that thing with the handcuffs?

17:00.200 --> 17:02.300
Probably not your scene.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.599
I have waited for what seems...

17:13.599 --> 17:16.800
Like a whole light-year...

17:18.000 --> 17:21.400
Just to see your face...

17:21.400 --> 17:24.400
Once again, my dear...

17:25.500 --> 17:33.700
Shiny brown-eyed moonlight, Sunlight, starlight...

17:33.700 --> 17:39.600
With big dark eyes that send me out of sight...

17:39.600 --> 17:43.200
Now I'm staring at the stars...

17:43.900 --> 17:47.400
- Are you expecting someone?
- No, I'm not expecting someone.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.600
Because if you're here expecting
someone and not to buy me a drink, ...

17:49.600 --> 17:53.000
...you should tell me now so I
can divorce you and take the house.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.500
Joanne, have another white wine.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.900
You're the guy?!

18:07.300 --> 18:09.100
Sit down.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.200
Well, I'll be damned.

18:16.500 --> 18:21.800
Whoa, ooh, that beer, it went right
through me. I got to... I'll be right back.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.500
- You sabotaged a UFO?
- Keep your voice down.

18:26.700 --> 18:33.700
I didn't intend for it to crash, Agent Mulder. I just
meant to disable the stealth module so you could see it.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.200
Scully.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.100
Mulder?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.300
Is that really you?

18:52.700 --> 18:54.900
What are you doing here?

18:55.400 --> 18:58.100
I'm trying to figure out a way to help you.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.300
- What, are you, like, disgruntled?
- You make me sound like some postal clerk.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.200
What you came for is on the floor by your feet.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.900
Morris?

19:45.000 --> 19:51.800
In my memory you are moonlight, starlight...

19:51.800 --> 19:57.700
With big dark eyes that send me out of sight...

19:57.700 --> 20:02.500
Now I'm staring at the stars...

20:02.500 --> 20:06.200
Wondering where you are...

20:06.200 --> 20:12.800
Wondering if I'll ever see your face again...

20:12.800 --> 20:17.200
Now I'm staring at the stars...

20:17.200 --> 20:21.000
Wondering where you are...

20:21.000 --> 20:22.500
Joanne?

20:22.800 --> 20:25.200
Hey, how's it going?

20:25.200 --> 20:29.400
- Listen, have you seen Morry?
- You bet I've seen him.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.500
Hey, hey, whoa, guys. Guys.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.100
- What the hell was that, Morry?
- I guess I make a lousy husband.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.300
I'll talk to her.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.400
So you're the guy that wants my life.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.900
I assume that includes all the ass-kickings.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.600
- Oh, no... You don't want to do this.
- Yeah, I do.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.700
- Jeff's outside.
- So what?

21:25.700 --> 21:30.700
If he sees us together, we're both dead.
Especially when he sees this.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.800
You take that to Scully right now.

21:38.800 --> 21:42.800
You must have some sort of waxy buildup.
I said Jeff's here.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.400
No way am I going out there until he leaves.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.200
You sneak it past him.
You're his buddy.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.700
His buddy? He doesn't trust me as far
as he can throw me. You saw to that.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.300
Oh, geez.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.200
Hey.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.900
Hey.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.100
...as long as the sun would shine...

22:27.100 --> 22:30.700
You would love me, love me...

22:30.700 --> 22:33.700
And I hope you'll love the sunshine...

22:33.700 --> 22:36.100
One more time...

22:36.100 --> 22:37.800
- Jeff.
- General Wegman.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.100
You men, come with me.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.800
Sir...

22:48.800 --> 22:50.500
What are we, uh...?

22:50.500 --> 22:52.600
There. Detain that man.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.700
Morris... Stop.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.200
Hey, guys.

23:04.900 --> 23:10.200
- What's in the bag, Morris?
- It's, uh... Beer.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.100
- You sure it's not a flight data recorder?
- No, it's beer.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.800
Suckers.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.700
Mmm. More huevos rancheros.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.500
Mas huevos rancheros.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.500
Por favor.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.200
Open up.

24:19.100 --> 24:22.100
Mulder... If I'd known you were
coming I would have made more salsa.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.100
- We need your help right now.
- Who crashed?

24:25.100 --> 24:31.400
Who, what, why. I need to know
everything that's on that data recorder.

24:32.200 --> 24:36.900
It's similar in size and
shape to the FDRs on the SR-71.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.300
Well, that's definitely not standard issue.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.300
- Where did you get this?
- Groom Lake. Outside Area 51.

24:48.300 --> 24:52.200
- Dreamland.
- The Aurora spy plane.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.900
- What's that?
- Black world. Top, top secret. A skunkworks special.

24:56.900 --> 25:01.900
Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance
aircraft fueled with slush-hydrogen.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.300
Or methylcyclohexane.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
What's with him?

25:11.600 --> 25:16.300
You guys like the name? I'm going to go
with either "Aurora" or "Borealis."

25:18.300 --> 25:21.300
- What the hell's he talking about?
- Mulder...

25:21.300 --> 25:22.900
He's not Mulder.

25:27.600 --> 25:35.900
We think the crash of this particular
aircraft, whatever it was, resulted in a, uh...

25:41.800 --> 25:45.600
My name is Morris Fletcher.
I work inside Area 51.

25:45.600 --> 25:50.000
I assumed Mulder's identity through
a warp in the space-time continuum.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.900
Trust me, little man, I ain't him.

26:06.500 --> 26:10.000
Oh, I love you guys. I really do. I mean,
you're the "Lone Gunmen," aren't you?

26:10.100 --> 26:13.300
You guys are my heroes. I mean,
look at this crap you print.

26:13.300 --> 26:16.000
- We uncover the truth.
- Oh, the truth. Well, ...

26:16.000 --> 26:17.700
...see that's what's so great about you monkeys.

26:17.700 --> 26:23.800
Not only do you believe this horse pucky that we
create you broadcast it as well. I mean, look at this.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.400
There is no Saddam Hussein.

26:27.700 --> 26:31.700
This guy's name is John Gillnitz.
We found him doing dinner theater in Tulsa.

26:31.700 --> 26:35.200
Did a mean King and I.
Plays good ethnics.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.000
You're trying to say that
Saddam Hussein's a government plant?

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm saying I invented the guy.
We set him up in '79.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.600
He rattles his saber whenever
we need a good distraction. Ah...

26:46.600 --> 26:50.800
If you boys only knew how many of your
stories I dreamed up while sitting on the pot.

26:50.800 --> 26:54.500
- What stories?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Melvin, that's classified.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.400
The name's Frohike, you punk ass.
What the hell did you do with Mulder?

26:57.400 --> 27:02.500
Shut up, all of you. If you guys
want Mulder back, get me these results.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.400
- Who is it?
- Morris Fletcher.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.000
Come in.

27:16.500 --> 27:20.300
We shouldn't be seen together.
Not after last night.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.600
Fletcher... Mulder... Whoever you are.

27:23.600 --> 27:28.700
I'm hoping this'll be our last meeting. Agent Scully's
flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.600
It'll be too late to save me.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.300
I know. The real Morris
Fletcher knows you're the leak.

27:34.300 --> 27:37.300
Once you get back, if you get back, ...

27:37.300 --> 27:40.200
...he'll have me arrested.
Disappeared.

27:40.200 --> 27:46.100
Even if he doesn't his colleagues will
figure out soon enough I sabotaged that craft.

27:46.900 --> 27:50.200
- Why'd you do it?
- I didn't mean for it to crash.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.000
I just wanted you to see it.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.400
Well, why?

27:58.900 --> 28:03.600
There comes a time when you...
look back instead of forward...

28:03.600 --> 28:06.300
See the sum of your life.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.900
My entire career has been spent hiding the truth...

28:08.900 --> 28:13.800
...from the American people destroying,
in a way, that which was most precious to me.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.500
What is the truth?

28:17.800 --> 28:21.300
You mean... You don't know?

28:22.300 --> 28:27.300
- I don't know what?
- The truth, what *is* going on here at Area 51?

28:27.300 --> 28:32.000
What are these black-budget projects?
We just fly these birds.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.100
They don't tell us what makes them go.
They engineer them all up in Utah.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.500
Well, if you don't know, why'd you call me?

28:42.700 --> 28:48.600
Well, I... I've seen your file.
You've chased flying saucers for years.

28:51.300 --> 28:55.400
Do aliens really exist, Agent Mulder?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.500
Something's coming up.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.100
Got it.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.800
- What is it?
- We broke the encryption.

29:07.800 --> 29:12.400
This baby records the telemetry of 28 systems
including airspeed, fuselage torque and delta-v.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.000
Yeah, all the usual readouts, but, uh...
What are these?

29:16.000 --> 29:20.200
Tachyon flux... Gravitational displacement.

29:20.300 --> 29:24.000
"Aurora," my ass. What have
you guys been flying out there?

29:24.400 --> 29:27.700
All right, I want you guys to analyze that data.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.400
- Morris...
- This is one of mine.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.900
- Get your butt in gear.
- You're going to miss me when I'm gone.

29:32.900 --> 29:36.000
- Fat chance, laughing boy.
- Back off, Sneezy.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Enough.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.800
Call me when you guys have some answers.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.700
Ah, far out.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.700
- The black mailbox.
- Dude, that's a white mailbox.

29:51.700 --> 29:57.600
No, they painted it white to hide it.
This is the black mailbox.

29:57.600 --> 30:03.100
The best place to see Freedom Mountain
and the UFOs over Dreamland, man.

30:03.500 --> 30:10.000
I know a guy who saw five in one night.
He said they danced in the sky.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.100
You guys hear that?

30:17.200 --> 30:19.400
What the hell?

30:26.600 --> 30:29.500
Cool.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.000
Did you guys see that?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.400
You don't look too happy.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.100
Don't tell me I'm going to have
to put two kids through school.

31:31.800 --> 31:35.300
That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.800
I, uh...

31:43.200 --> 31:46.500
I just got off the phone with Frohike.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.600
They were able to download
and analyze the crash data...

31:51.600 --> 31:54.500
...and, yes, there was an
anomalous event that night.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.800
And how do I get back?

31:56.800 --> 31:59.500
Well, that's just it.

31:59.500 --> 32:06.300
It's all about random moments in time... About a
series of variables approaching an event horizon.

32:06.300 --> 32:13.000
And even if we... could recreate that
moment if we could sabotage another craft...

32:14.400 --> 32:22.000
Mulder, if we were... If we were off...
If the event were off by even one millisecond...

32:22.000 --> 32:25.800
I might wind up with my head in a rock.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.200
Something like that, yeah.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.300
What about him?

32:42.300 --> 32:45.600
I mean, me. Whatever.
Whoever he is.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.900
Agent Mulder has become AD
Kersh's new golden boy.

32:50.600 --> 32:56.900
He's been tasked with returning the
flight data recorder that he and I stole.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.600
The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh
even more than I do to my priest.

33:02.800 --> 33:08.000
- I'm just tagging along for the ride.
- What do you mean, "just tagging along"?

33:08.000 --> 33:11.600
I'm out of the Bureau.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.400
I've been censured and
relieved of my position.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.900
No. You can explain it to them like you
explained it to me. You have the data.

33:18.900 --> 33:23.600
You can make them understand.
You can get your job back.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.100
I'd kiss you if you weren't so damn ugly.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.200
Take a picture, it'll last longer.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.500
If I... shoot him is that murder or suicide?

33:47.700 --> 33:51.100
Neither, if I do it first.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.100
Hey, Scully...

34:54.199 --> 34:57.700
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
You got to help me!

34:57.700 --> 34:58.800
You got to help me!

34:58.800 --> 35:01.700
Open the window!
Please, open your window!

35:01.700 --> 35:04.500
I need to talk to you!
Please, I need somebody to help me.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.500
It's this thing... It was like,
like, like a wave...

35:07.500 --> 35:10.600
Like all squiggly and everything...

35:11.700 --> 35:15.200
And... And their faces,
they, they stuck together!

35:15.200 --> 35:20.100
And, and, and her arm...
it was coming through his chest!

35:23.600 --> 35:28.100
Sam, man, where you been?
Who's the dude?

35:29.400 --> 35:33.300
I swear, man... They were messed up.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.100
I believe you.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.200
So the motel guy wants cash. Won't
take credit card, do you believe that?

35:51.200 --> 35:55.500
So then it hits me, I flash
him my badge: "Fox Mulder, FBI."

35:56.700 --> 36:01.900
I tell him we're investigating crappy motels
in the Southwest. He'd better watch his behind.

36:01.900 --> 36:07.800
So guess what? The guy gives me the room for
free and he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.300
I love this job!

36:15.200 --> 36:18.300
Listen, Dana, after we return this flight recorder...

36:18.300 --> 36:23.100
...what do you say I have a word with the big man,
see if I can get you your job back?

36:23.100 --> 36:28.400
We could have lots of fun together once
you got to know me. You know that, Danes?

36:28.400 --> 36:30.400
I've still got my gun.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.900
All right, already.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.600
Wait a second, hold on.

36:35.900 --> 36:36.700
Back up.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.000
- What is it?
- Back up.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.600
Can I help you, ma'am?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.800
I don't understand. This... this
place was burnt to the ground.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.900
I don't think so.

37:15.900 --> 37:20.000
Yeah... This place, two nights ago.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.800
I think I'd remember that.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.400
What's going on?

38:02.000 --> 38:06.300
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you. Something's happened.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.200
Morris!
Don't forget your stupid chair!

38:09.200 --> 38:12.100
You and it should be very happy together!

38:17.000 --> 38:19.900
Terence, get back inside.

38:22.700 --> 38:26.600
- You got a lot of gall coming back here, sister.
- Joanne, I told you-- I'm not your husband.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.500
- This man is.
- You come here to watch my family fall apart?

38:29.500 --> 38:32.400
You getting some kind of big kick out of that?

38:33.800 --> 38:36.600
I have to talk to you alone.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.000
Homewrecker!

38:52.000 --> 38:55.600
- Careful. You're going to bust a lung.
- Leave me alone.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.500
Joanne...

38:58.400 --> 39:01.800
What he said about me being your husband...

39:01.800 --> 39:03.700
...it's true.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.500
Get the hell off my porch.

39:07.900 --> 39:13.300
We got married on June 13, 1978.
It rained that day.

39:13.600 --> 39:18.600
You got mad at me at the reception because
I said couldn't see the cake behind your fat ass.

39:23.900 --> 39:29.200
Remember our first apartment...
that dump in Pentagon City?

39:29.200 --> 39:33.000
You'd turn the air conditioner on
and the lights would go out?

39:33.200 --> 39:37.500
Or when you were pregnant how I'd
tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh?

39:38.700 --> 39:43.000
Remember?
Remember the night Chrissy was born?

39:43.400 --> 39:46.900
When I held her in my arms
all red-faced and screaming?

39:46.900 --> 39:50.100
That was the only time I ever saw you cry.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.700
Oh, my God...

39:54.700 --> 39:58.900
Morris?
Is that you?

40:00.000 --> 40:04.500
- Come on, Morris. Let's go.
- What do you mean, go? Where are you taking him?

40:04.500 --> 40:07.400
Mrs. Fletcher, we have reason to believe
that whatever event caused this...

40:07.400 --> 40:10.800
- ...to happen may be in the process of reversing.
- We got to get back to that highway, ...

40:10.800 --> 40:16.400
...back to the exact spot where this
all began. It may be our only chance.

40:28.200 --> 40:33.100
- Sorry, Morris. A traitor's a traitor.
- This isn't what it looks like.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.900
Got it!

40:50.900 --> 40:52.200
Sir.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.000
- What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up a mess.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.800
- What are you talking about?
- About an hour ago...

41:12.800 --> 41:16.900
...I put Captain McDonough and Mrs. Chee
back where they belong. Now it's their turn.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.900
The warp that started this is
snapping back like a rubber band.

41:19.900 --> 41:23.700
Only we have to be in
its path when it happens.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.300
Why are you doing this?

41:28.300 --> 41:32.100
Till now, I had a spotless
career record. I want that back.

41:32.100 --> 41:35.100
So this is time snapping back?

41:35.100 --> 41:38.800
It'll be like the last few days never happened.
You won't remember any of this.

41:38.800 --> 41:43.200
Oh. Well, in that case,
Dana... It's been real.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.100
Come on, Mulder.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.700
Let's go.

42:32.700 --> 42:35.100
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

42:35.100 --> 42:39.100
I just wanted to let you know
that we slipped under Kersh's radar.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.900
Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.100
Oh, yeah?

42:43.100 --> 42:48.200
Mulder, I'm sorry that your
confidential source didn't pan out.

42:48.200 --> 42:53.100
Well, I guess you were right, Scully. Just
another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek.

42:53.900 --> 42:57.000
- Good night.
- Hey, Scully?

42:57.000 --> 43:00.100
I, uh, know it's not your normal life, but...

43:00.100 --> 43:02.500
Thanks for coming out there with me.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.900
You're welcome.
