Good.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.122

that I was not going to see
much action

03:29.542 --> 03:30.793
Wait a minute, guys.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.462

03:32.545 --> 03:33.963
{\an1}Yeah,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.757
if your girlfriend is into sex
as a spectator sport.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.841
I'm sure Steve

Next time, I'll bring you the

05:04.303 --> 05:05.388
So, historically,

05:05.471 --> 05:07.390
very few cultures
have saddled themselves

05:07.473 --> 05:10.393
with this notion
of "till death do us part."

05:10.476 --> 05:12.395
Instead, people tended

05:12.478 --> 05:14.897
toward something Margaret Mead
called "serial monogamy,"

05:14.981 --> 05:15.606
which is what?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.566
{\an3}Anyone?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.068
{\an4}KELLY:
It's the idea
that we take

05:19.152 --> 05:21.904
different partners for different
phases of our lives.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.949
{\an1}One for sex
when we're young,

05:25.033 --> 05:27.577
one to father
our children,

05:27.660 --> 05:30.538
and one for companionship
as we grow older.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.956
Right.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.458
And, unlike most academics,

05:33.541 --> 05:36.461
Margaret Mead put her money
where her mouth is.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.628
{\an3}That's exactly what she
did in her own life.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.672
Where's it end?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.758
{\an1}I mean, why not just have
someone new every year?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.134
I've tried it.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.552
{\an3}I wouldn't
recommend it.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.430
{\an6}LUCINDA:
Well, let me leave you with
one radical thought:

05:47.513 --> 05:49.474
Monogamy is...

05:49.557 --> 05:52.894
sleeping with one person
at a time.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.521
{\an3}Have a good
weekend.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.448
{\an1}So, which one of those
partners am I?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.616
Nat's your partner.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.825
Ha, ha, ha.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.659
Are you coming
to the Peach Pit?

06:08.743 --> 06:10.495
{\an6}Yeah, I'll catch
up with you.
Okay.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.747
What are you
doing here?

06:12.830 --> 06:14.207
{\an3}You weren't supposed
to hear that.

06:14.290 --> 06:14.957
{\an1}Well, then
I'm glad I did.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.335
{\an1}That was quite
some finale, teach.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.462
{\an3}A little sensational, I know,
but whatever it takes

06:19.545 --> 06:20.463
{\an3}to bring them back
next week.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.673
{\an1}Thank you for letting me read
your grant proposal.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.634
And...

06:24.717 --> 06:27.470
what'd you think?
Oh, I don't know,

06:27.553 --> 06:28.304
{\an1}I think it's a little
presumptuous of me

06:28.387 --> 06:30.139
{\an1}to pass judgment
on your doctoral thesis.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.141
You didn't like it.

06:32.225 --> 06:32.642
Quite the contrary.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.601
I was pretty amazed.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.602
{\an1}I'd like to see
that film sometime.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.855
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a great idea.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.606
The, the film is
very unfinished.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.442
Well, isn't that
the point?

06:41.526 --> 06:42.944
You need money
to finish it.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.947
You two have no idea
how weird this is--

06:46.030 --> 06:49.158
I mean, hitting up an undergrad
for a grant to finish my thesis.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.244
How's tomorrow?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.663
Well, I'll be off with
the brain trust

06:53.746 --> 06:55.206
for higher education,

06:55.289 --> 06:56.874
but you guys
go ahead.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.835
Okay.
I'll book a room.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.003
I'll be there.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.969
{\an3}Why do I feel like
everything Lucinda says

07:08.052 --> 07:08.636
is targeted right at me?

07:08.719 --> 07:10.763
Everyone does.

07:10.847 --> 07:11.848
She's trying to be
thought-provoking.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.724
{\an6}DONNA:
It's a good thing Andrea
was at the doctor,

07:13.808 --> 07:15.852
{\an3}because she would have
had a miscarriage.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.561
{\an1}Oh, come on,
it's interesting stuff.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.646
The descent of women

07:18.729 --> 07:22.191
{\an1}to our present
pathetic status.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.193
Hey, if you had just
said "I do" to Stuart

07:24.277 --> 07:25.903
you would be
a queen now.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.697
More like
a paid mistress.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.032
{\an1}No, I definitely called
that one right.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.493
{\an3}No regrets?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.537
{\an1}Well...

07:34.620 --> 07:37.498
{\an3}maybe one.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.251
{\an1}After Stuart showed his
true colors last weekend,

07:40.334 --> 07:43.296
{\an1}and Dylan had to come
pick me up in Palm Springs,

07:43.379 --> 07:45.715
somehow, on the way home,
I ended up telling Dylan

07:45.798 --> 07:49.218
{\an1}that I still had a thing
for him.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.553
You did what?!

07:50.636 --> 07:51.512
{\an1}I know!

07:51.596 --> 07:53.431
{\an1}I can't believe it myself.
But what can I say?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.016
It was a long ride home

07:55.099 --> 07:57.101
{\an1}and I guess I was feeling
sorry for myself.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.606
{\an3}You know, I... I think
we're being stalked.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.577
I think you're right.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.829
(panting)

08:21.834 --> 08:24.045
{\an1}He looks hungry,
doesn't he?

08:24.128 --> 08:24.754
{\an3}Oh, dogs always
look hungry.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.340
That's their job.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.174
Hi. Come here,

08:28.257 --> 08:29.800
{\an1}I got something for you
in here. Yeah.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.553
Look, look.

08:32.636 --> 08:33.261
What's that?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.804
There, that's right,
come on.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.765
Oh, see?
He is hungry.

08:36.849 --> 08:40.061
{\an3}He would have to be hungry
to eat that stuff.

08:40.144 --> 08:40.727
{\an3}He's a pretty
cool dog.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.105

to anyone?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.440
{\an3}Afraid so.

08:44.524 --> 08:44.982
{\an3}That's a pretty serious-
looking collar.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.109

no tags.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.045
{\an4}DONNA:
Wow, it looks
kind of blurry,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.421
{\an1}but it's
incredible-looking.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.839
{\an3}Look, isn't
it amazing?

10:31.922 --> 10:33.341
{\an3}See, that's
the head.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.717
Jesse and I saw him
on the monitor, moving.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.219
So it's a boy?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.222
I don't know what it is.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.891
I don't know why
I called it a "him."

10:41.974 --> 10:43.893
I think it's a boy.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.895
Now, to me it looks
like a girl.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.481
Steve? Tiebreaker?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.235
I think it looks
like a megaburger.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.570
You're disgusting.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.905
{\an3}I could just
be hungry.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.114
{\an4}ANDREA:
Guess what,
you guys?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.574
{\an3}I got the
weekend job

10:58.657 --> 11:00.284
{\an3}at the campus medical
research lab.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.577
{\an3}Wow!

11:01.660 --> 11:02.661
{\an1}You're really
on a roll.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.122
Yeah. And the woman I'm
going to be working for

11:05.206 --> 11:07.375
{\an3}is supposed to be a
first-rate researcher.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.460
{\an3}Plus she has children,
so she understands.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.419
{\an3}Well, with the
baby on the way,

11:10.503 --> 11:11.754
I thought you'd want
to do less, not more.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.299
Well, it is for the baby.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.426
We have to save money
for our little friend here.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.637
{\an3}(dog barks,
dishes clatter)

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
NAT:
Hey, hey, stop that dog!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.432
Stop that dog!

11:23.516 --> 11:24.183
(dog whimpering)

11:24.266 --> 11:26.560
See, I told you
he was a genius.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.561
Donna, when'd you get a dog?

11:27.645 --> 11:28.562
{\an1}Just now.
Hey, wait a second.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.564
{\an1}He might prefer
living at Casa Walsh.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.983
{\an3}Hey, you didn't even
want him before.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.610
{\an1}No, I didn't want
to abduct him.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.862
{\an3}Well, you know what wise
old King Solomon would say?

11:38.864 --> 11:39.240
Cut him in two.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.325
Give each half.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.952
That passed for wise?

11:43.035 --> 11:43.953
Then.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.079
{\an3}Get the dog
out, will you?

11:45.162 --> 11:47.289
{\an3}ANDREA:
Aw...

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
Looks like the dog's
already chosen.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.460
{\an3}Aw, come on,
Bren, please...

11:51.544 --> 11:54.088
Okay, but I get
visiting rights.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.297
(chuckles)

12:02.555 --> 12:03.889
You know, babe,

12:03.973 --> 12:06.934
you are backward in
your tube culture.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.812
{\an1}Yeah, well, for an academic,
I'm way ahead.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.440
It's a miracle
I've got cable.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.818
Well, let's see, we've
done Home Shopping...

12:15.901 --> 12:17.528
done Public Access...

12:17.611 --> 12:18.279
(man speaking Korean
on television)

12:18.362 --> 12:21.323
Neither of us
speak Korean.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.200
{\an3}Oh, look, we're
just in time

12:23.284 --> 12:27.830
for the week's five biggest
saves on the Hockey Channel.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.624
{\an1}Do you know what I miss least
about my ex-husband?

12:30.708 --> 12:34.462
His devotion to sports.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.505
{\an3}Right.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.215
(television clicks off)

12:38.299 --> 12:39.842
So are you going to miss me
this weekend while I'm gone?

12:39.925 --> 12:44.555
{\an1}Well, luckily, I'll have Dylan
to fill my idle hours.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.723
Brandon, I was kidding.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.684
{\an3}So you won't be
seeing Dylan?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.810
Is this for real?

12:50.936 --> 12:54.356
I'll be seeing him to try to
get him to finance my movie.

12:54.440 --> 12:54.899
{\an1}I'll show him the film,
make him a meal,

12:54.982 --> 12:57.026
and hope he's impressed.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.570
{\an3}Let me guess: something
spicy and Guatemalan.

12:59.653 --> 13:04.158
{\an1}Oh, God, you really think
the world of me, don't you?

13:04.241 --> 13:04.992
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

13:05.075 --> 13:08.245
It's not you.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.415
It just seems like lately, every
time I get something I want,

13:11.499 --> 13:12.208
along comes Dylan
with his money and...

13:12.291 --> 13:15.503
{\an1}Brandon, I'm not
some trading card.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.463
{\an1}And I really don't like
this petty jealousy.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.632
Well, what do you expect?

13:19.715 --> 13:20.341
We spend
most of our time together

13:20.424 --> 13:22.384
pretending we're not together.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.302
Well, it's the same for me,
but I don't turn green

13:23.385 --> 13:25.513
because you slip out of town
with Kelly.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.516
Well, maybe you should,
it might be nice.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.725
I think it's time I left.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.019
{\an1}Brandon...

13:34.980 --> 13:37.900
{\an1}If you're going to be away
all weekend,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.151
{\an1}don't you want
to stay now?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.110
No.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.111
Yeah.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.571
No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.573
No, I...
Yes, you... you do.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.618
{\an3}(groaning):
All right, I do.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.298
(dog barking)

14:05.719 --> 14:06.929
{\an1}No.

14:07.012 --> 14:07.805
You know when they say

14:07.888 --> 14:09.265
{\an1}a dog's mouth is cleaner
than a human's?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.016
I don't think this is
what they had in mind.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.017
Here, come here.

14:12.101 --> 14:12.268
{\an1}I'll get you
something good.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.603
No.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.647
(classical music being played
on piano, in distance)

14:16.730 --> 14:17.773
Here.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.080
What?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.128
{\an1}Well, I guess he's
a Rachmaninoff fan, too.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.339
So, that's what
we'll call him.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.008
Sergey Rachmaninoff?

14:44.091 --> 14:46.468
{\an3}Rocky.
(dog barks)

14:46.552 --> 14:48.137
{\an3}You guys,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.306
I don't mean
to rain on your parade,

14:50.389 --> 14:51.974
but don't you think
we should find his owner

14:52.057 --> 14:53.475
before we all get
too attached to him?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.310
{\an3}Well, I'm putting
the posters up today.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.980
{\an3}They're over there
on the table.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.023
{\an3}Donna...

14:59.106 --> 15:01.483
{\an1}it looks more like you lost
a dog than found a dog,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.110
{\an1}and it doesn't really look
like him.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.447
{\an6}DONNA:
Well, I did the
best I could.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.450
What are you
looking at?

15:09.533 --> 15:12.161
This shaved spot on his chest,
what is this?

15:12.244 --> 15:13.245
Yeah, there's one
right there, too.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.002
{\an3}Well, maybe
it's nothing.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.087
Yeah.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.801
{\an5}JIM:
<i>So... how goes</i>
<i>the fight to get more</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:29.303
teaching hours
out of the senior faculty?

15:29.386 --> 15:31.305
{\an3}Could be a major
victory this weekend.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.723
{\an3}The dean's already
on our side

15:32.806 --> 15:34.558
{\an3}and I think the chancellor's
ready to cave in.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.726
Hey, that was fast.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.103
Well, Kelly and I worked him
like a tag team

15:38.187 --> 15:39.229
at the Regents' Reception
last week.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.231
{\an3}I didn't know Kelly
was on the task force.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.194
She's not, she just came
with me... as my date.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.487
{\an1}Your date?
(door opens)

15:46.570 --> 15:47.738
KELLY:
Brandon, we're here!

15:47.821 --> 15:50.199
Dad, explain the date concept
to your wife for me, will you?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.951
{\an3}Parts of this may
shock you, Mom.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.703
(Cindy laughs sarcastically,
dog barking)

15:54.787 --> 15:56.497
{\an3}Kelly is
going with you

15:56.580 --> 15:57.498
on the retreat?

15:57.581 --> 16:01.669
{\an3}That's that date
concept again.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.047
Oh, this must be the genius dog
Brenda was talking about.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.048
Hey, buddy.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.549
{\an3}Yes, we named
him Rocky.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.551
Oh, as in Rambo?!

16:09.635 --> 16:10.302
As in Rachmaninoff.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.262
He <i> is</i> a musical genius.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.263
I'm sure he is.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.057
{\an1}So, Kelly,
you're going off

16:15.140 --> 16:16.100
{\an3}to this retreat
with Brandon?

16:16.183 --> 16:19.395
Yep. It's getting so
he can't leave home

16:19.478 --> 16:20.854
{\an3}without me.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.272
{\an6}DONNA:
Mrs. Walsh,
will you look

16:22.356 --> 16:23.732
at this, please?

16:23.816 --> 16:24.733
Here.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.068
{\an3}Good Rocky.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.069
That is strange.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.529
Jim, look at that.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.406
Do you think he was abused?

16:30.489 --> 16:31.657
{\an1}No, but...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.283
{\an1}it looks like
he was operated on.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.619
{\an1}Or abducted by aliens
for some heinous experiment.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.620
Ow.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.955
I'm serious.

16:38.038 --> 16:38.622
Do you think he's okay?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.374
{\an3}Well, he looks
just fine,

16:40.457 --> 16:41.250
but a visit to the vet
might be a good idea.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.251
{\an6}DONNA:
When will
Brenda be back?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.628
{\an1}She should be back
in about ten minutes.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.463
{\an4}BRANDON:
Well, you guys will have
to say good-bye for us.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.257
We got to get
out of here.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.258
Bye.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.300
{\an1}CINDY:
Bye! Have fun.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.760
Yo, later, Rock-o.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.387
Bye.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.388
(door closes)

16:54.471 --> 16:55.431
Want some orange juice?

16:55.514 --> 16:56.557
{\an3}DONNA:
Great, thanks.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.434
Come on, up... up.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.935
Up.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.437
(giggles)

17:01.520 --> 17:03.731
(knocking on door)

17:09.862 --> 17:11.780
Muntz.
Studying?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.240
{\an3}Actually,
I'm reeling.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.491
Would you believe

17:14.575 --> 17:18.454
{\an1}the male produces
100 million sperm a day?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.455
{\an3}It kind of explains
everything, doesn't it?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.498
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.332
{\an1}Come on, the commandant
down the hall

17:22.415 --> 17:24.626
{\an1}doesn't like me
making noise in here.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.961
All right?

17:26.044 --> 17:26.962
I got to keep it quiet.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.422
{\an1}Well, hang tough, man,
this is a palace.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.798
{\an3}Yeah, some
mood lighting,

17:29.882 --> 17:33.135
maybe a couple dancing girls,
this place would be all right.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.928
It's definitely a lot better
than the KEG House.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.139
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.308
{\an1}You met my girlfriend
Sherry, right?

17:39.391 --> 17:40.642
{\an3}Yeah.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.354
Well, she's finally starting
to get amorous.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.148
All right.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.483
Uh, look,

17:47.566 --> 17:49.818
{\an3}I'd love to help you
out, but, uh, I'm sorry,

17:49.902 --> 17:51.487
Andrea made me promise--
no KEG scene here.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.614
{\an1}Oh, man, we've been going out
for two years

17:53.697 --> 17:56.492
and I'm finally
in position to score.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.285
Two years? You've been going out
for two years

17:58.368 --> 18:00.037
and you still haven't slept
with this girl?

18:01.705 --> 18:04.541
Muntz... are you a virgin?

18:04.625 --> 18:08.337
And I'm always gonna be unless
I get a little private time.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.840
{\an1}Come on, man,
it's a noble cause.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.509
Please.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.096
Okay, we'll be very quiet.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.055
{\an3}(laughs)

18:18.138 --> 18:20.390
I doubt that.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.230
(indistinct conversations)

18:28.899 --> 18:30.818
Boy, when they said
"relaxed setting,"

18:30.901 --> 18:31.902
they weren't kidding.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.363
Yeah, I'm having flashbacks
to my summer camp days.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.907
Well, you must feel
right at home then.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.908
Actually, I don't understand

18:37.991 --> 18:39.368
what it is
I'm supposed to do here.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.327
{\an3}Do what you do
best, dear--

18:40.410 --> 18:43.372
{\an3}wow the chancellor,
charm the dean.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.749
Hmm, that's not
what I do best.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.048
{\an1}Well, looks like
seminar's till 5:00

18:53.131 --> 18:55.050
and then fun and games.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
{\an3}Oh, it really
is summer camp.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.261
{\an3}Look, girls' and
boys' cabins.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.345
It's all right, dear,

18:58.428 --> 19:02.975
{\an1}we'll only be separated
for one night.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.936
Oh, no.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.730
They're having
a square dance.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.566
{\an1}DEAN:
Brandon, Kelly.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.402
Dean, Chancellor.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.528
Good to see you guys.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.571
Glad we found you.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.738
{\an3}KELLY:
Likewise.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.073
{\an5}Brandon.
Isn't this
place beautiful?

19:18.156 --> 19:18.991
Yeah, I'm just waiting

19:19.074 --> 19:20.617
for someone
to start singing "Kumbaya."

19:20.701 --> 19:21.702
{\an3}(laughs)

19:21.785 --> 19:22.870
{\an3}Exactly.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.413
{\an1}CHANCELLOR:
This is my daughter Clare.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.249
{\an1}Clare, this is Kelly Taylor
and Brandon Walsh.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.250
{\an3}Hi.

19:28.333 --> 19:28.750
{\an3}You guys are
totally opposite

19:28.834 --> 19:30.586
of what I expected.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.587
How so?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.297
{\an1}Well, my dad said
you were very cool,

19:33.380 --> 19:36.592
so, naturally,
I expected the worst.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.970
{\an1}Kelly, I asked them to put you
and Clare in the same cabin.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.555
{\an1}I hope
that's all right.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.556
It's fine by me.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.557
{\an1}I think
he's counting on you

19:43.640 --> 19:44.433
to be my chaperone.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.394
{\an1}And I'll be counting on you
to be hers.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.024
(both chuckling)

19:52.107 --> 19:56.778
{\an6}LUCINDA:
I warned you, it's
just raw footage.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.406
Why the parade?

19:59.489 --> 20:01.408
It's a kind
of wedding march.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.243
See, the entire community
checks out the house

20:03.327 --> 20:04.912
{\an3}that the bride and
groom built together.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.581
It's a symbol of
their commitment.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.624
{\an1}So, if it doesn't
pass muster,

20:08.707 --> 20:11.418
{\an1}the wedding
doesn't take place.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.628
How are they
making out?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.630
All systems go.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.964
There's the happy couple.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.841
Look at them.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.301
They're beautiful.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.305
That's all anyone really wants,
is to be happy.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.182
{\an1}We drive
ourselves crazy.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.516
I think happiness
is overrated.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.393
And I think
it's all we've got to go by.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.316
Sometimes I walk around campus
and I see people

20:34.399 --> 20:35.317
and I ask myself,
"Why are they smiling?"

20:35.400 --> 20:37.819
{\an1}Yeah, but then
you meet someone

20:37.903 --> 20:40.364
that's found something in life,
or at least they're searching,

20:40.447 --> 20:41.490
and you think, "I want this,

20:41.573 --> 20:44.284
{\an1}"what this person has.
I want

20:44.368 --> 20:46.328
to be fully alive."

20:47.579 --> 20:49.581
(film scraping)

20:54.294 --> 20:56.213
{\an1}Sorry, that was
a little out there.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.506
What are you thinking about?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.341
I'm wondering...

20:59.424 --> 21:01.009
Have you ever had
a feast prepared

21:01.093 --> 21:01.885
in the spicy tapizca style

21:01.969 --> 21:04.763
of the Istu Paca tribe
of Guatemala?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.682
(chuckling):
No.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.351
You're in for a real treat.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.650
(indistinct conversations)

21:29.121 --> 21:31.498
Hello.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.374
I'm the new camper.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.543
Brandon Walsh,
California University.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.378
{\an1}RICHLAND:
No kidding?

21:36.461 --> 21:37.462
That's where I go.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.505
Josh, what are
you doing here?

21:38.588 --> 21:39.548
You're not on the task force.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.592
{\an1}I'm just covering the event
for the <i> Condor.</i>

21:42.676 --> 21:44.720
So I was hoping
we could talk.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.762
I've got a few questions.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.389
{\an3}So I hear.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.641
My friends tell me you've been
badgering them for dirt on me.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.560
{\an1}Come on, you were
a newspaperman

21:51.643 --> 21:55.439
before you became
our fearless leader.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.441
You know, I'm just doing my job.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.943
{\an4}Right.
Anyway,
I'm through with your friends.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.404
All I need now
is maybe half an hour with you.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.989
Do your worst.

22:04.072 --> 22:04.948
{\an1}Okay.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.867
Your pal, Steve Sanders,
was caught

22:06.950 --> 22:09.578
breaking
into Cory Randall's office.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.622
What did you have on Randall
to get him to drop the charges?

22:14.166 --> 22:17.919
Is this what you've been
bothering my friends with, Josh?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.588
I didn't have anything
on Randall.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.797
I tutored

22:20.881 --> 22:23.550
his favorite jock, so,
when my best friend got

22:23.633 --> 22:25.802
in a little trouble
with a fraternity prank,

22:25.886 --> 22:27.262
Randall cut him some slack.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.389
It's hardly a conspiracy.

22:29.681 --> 22:34.102
Are you <i> friends</i>
with Randall's ex-wife?

22:34.186 --> 22:37.439
Listen, I don't mind questions,

22:37.522 --> 22:38.648
as long as they have something
to do with me.

22:38.732 --> 22:43.403
So you wouldn't know what or who
caused her to get a divorce.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.947
Why are you doing this?

22:46.031 --> 22:47.491
Honestly?

22:47.574 --> 22:49.951
'Cause I don't like you.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.620
Yeah, well...

22:51.703 --> 22:55.624
the feeling's mutual.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.848
You sure you don't need
some help in there?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.308
{\an3}Why? Are you
getting bored?

23:13.391 --> 23:14.601
No, I'm not getting bored.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.061
I'm getting paranoid

23:16.144 --> 23:18.647
with all these eyes staring
at me, you know?

23:20.690 --> 23:23.151
{\an3}So this is the authentic
harvest feast?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.569
Yes and no.

23:24.653 --> 23:30.992
To me, a feast is as much
the ceremony as the food.

23:31.076 --> 23:31.701
{\an3}So, what, are you
gonna sacrifice

23:31.785 --> 23:34.329
a virgin goat
or something?

23:34.413 --> 23:37.541
We need an attitude adjustment.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.876
Plus some candles.

23:45.090 --> 23:45.841
{\an1}As our ancestors did
in remembrance

23:45.924 --> 23:47.759
{\an1}of the first harvest
the earth gave up,

23:47.843 --> 23:52.597
{\an1}we give thanks
to the four corners.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.519
Earth...

23:57.602 --> 24:02.315
water...

24:02.399 --> 24:04.067
animals...

24:04.151 --> 24:07.487
and the universe...

24:07.571 --> 24:09.072
which is man.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.658
The light of the candles is
the light of the sun,

24:11.741 --> 24:16.037
warm and generous
and full of life.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.707
Anyway, something like that.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.666
Do you believe it?

24:19.749 --> 24:22.752
{\an1}I don't know
what I believe anymore.

24:22.836 --> 24:27.382
{\an1}Earth, water,
animals-- I get.

24:27.465 --> 24:30.719
But man is
still a mystery to me.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.973
I'm glad Kelly introduced us.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.684
You know she's my girlfriend.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.020
I also know you wouldn't be here
right now,

24:40.103 --> 24:41.855
if you didn't want to be.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.316
Did you hear me say
I don't want to be here?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.570
Well...

24:48.653 --> 24:50.697
Sex doesn't get any safer

24:50.780 --> 24:54.117
than when your girlfriend's
out of town.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.101
{\an1}KELLY:
Brandon, try to relax.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.770
{\an1}We're supposed to be
communing with nature here.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.813
Aw, I just never
should have let

25:23.897 --> 25:25.982
Richland get to me.

25:26.066 --> 25:26.900
Now he'll never let up.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.444
{\an3}Well, he is the world's
biggest jerk.

25:29.527 --> 25:30.612
Yes, he is.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.406
{\an1}You know, I'll bet you
he finessed our rooming setup

25:33.490 --> 25:34.950
{\an1}just in case
I talk in my sleep.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.409
So what?

25:36.493 --> 25:37.744
It's not like you have
anything to hide.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.789
I wouldn't say that.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.792
{\an3}Oh, right.
Our masquerade, I forgot.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.419
{\an3}Big deal.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.422
It's a little more
than that, Kel.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.425
What is it?

25:52.509 --> 25:52.968
(sighs)

25:53.051 --> 25:54.803
Lucinda Nicholson--

25:54.886 --> 25:59.182
your teacher--
she's my...

25:59.266 --> 26:03.812
well, "girlfriend" isn't exactly
the right word.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.649
Oh, my God.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.693
I had no idea.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.779
{\an3}So that's why you suddenly
needed me as a decoy.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.656
{\an1}Yes.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.783
I didn't want to drag
you into this.

26:16.866 --> 26:17.867
I hope you're not insulted.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.828
{\an3}No, I'm...

26:19.911 --> 26:22.664
I'm surprised.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.833
And I'm impressed.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.875
{\an1}(chuckles)

26:25.959 --> 26:28.003
Well, nobody else would be,

26:28.086 --> 26:28.712
so keep it to yourself.
Mm.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.214
They'd fire Lucinda

26:31.298 --> 26:33.508
and they'd kick me
off the task force.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.219
Oh, we have company.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.680
Everyone's favorite couple.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.849
We were just leaving.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.684
{\an1}Oh, too bad.
I was hoping I could get

26:42.767 --> 26:43.852
a few pithy quotes
from both of you.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.562
{\an1}Why don't you just make
something up, Joshie.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.855
That's what you're going
to do anyway, isn't it?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.691
No private life
for a public figure, Walsh.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.360
You better get used to it.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.779
{\an3}You want
something pithy?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.283
{\an3}Pith off!

27:01.870 --> 27:04.164
{\an1}(barking)

27:04.247 --> 27:04.998
DONNA:
<i>So, he was tortured?</i>

27:05.081 --> 27:07.042
Well, getting shaved is
unpleasant,

27:07.125 --> 27:08.126
but I hardly call it torture.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.878
These are just places
where they attach electrodes

27:09.961 --> 27:14.549
{\an1}for an
electrocardiograph-- EKG.

27:14.632 --> 27:15.717
{\an3}Does he have
a heart problem?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.552
Well, he seems fine.

27:17.635 --> 27:20.680
{\an1}You say you found him
on campus, right?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.016
Here's your answer.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.768
See this tattoo?

27:24.851 --> 27:27.395
He's from
the university medical lab.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.897
So he's an escapee
from an experiment?

27:28.980 --> 27:31.983
Animals don't just escape
from research facilities.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.737
Usually, they're freed
by some worker who doesn't like

27:35.820 --> 27:39.032
what's going on in the lab,
and can't risk losing their job.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.034
{\an1}They want
you to find him.

27:41.117 --> 27:43.078
But I thought you said
he was fine.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.204
Well, he seems to be,

27:44.287 --> 27:47.832
but there's no telling
what experiment he's been in.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.752
He could be sick,
or contagious.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.088
{\an3}So, how do
we find out?

27:53.171 --> 27:54.756
{\an1}Well, I hate
to tell you this,

27:54.839 --> 27:57.092
but we have to notify the lab.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.760
But that's where
he ran away from.

27:58.843 --> 28:02.680
I know. Believe me, I don't like
this any better than you do.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.807
Bren?

28:03.890 --> 28:04.891
{\an3}Look, Andrea's working
at the medical lab.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.936
Maybe she'll know
what's going on.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.687
Okay, we'll give her a call.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.357
Andrea wouldn't let
anything bad happen to Rocky.

{\an3}Thank God,
I'm not the one

28:52.105 --> 28:53.148
{\an3}who has to dance
with Richland.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.524
No, but you have

28:54.607 --> 28:55.358
{\an3}to dance with somebody
who's gonna ask you

28:55.442 --> 28:58.153
{\an3}a lot more questions
about yourself.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.863
She's in high school.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.531
Yeah.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.492
So, you're in high school.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.704
{\an1}Yeah, only four months left,
thank God.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.998
{\an1}Oh! I don't suppose
we could call a truce?

29:10.081 --> 29:10.915
{\an3}Who said
there was a war?

29:13.209 --> 29:14.210
{\an1}He's still
out for blood,

29:14.294 --> 29:15.670
and he's a bad
square dancer.

29:15.753 --> 29:17.005
{\an3}Well, Clare's
a pretty good dancer,

29:17.088 --> 29:18.673
{\an3}but I think she tried
to grope me.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.967
(caller pattering)

29:27.765 --> 29:29.809
{\an1}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait.

29:29.893 --> 29:30.768
I think he called
for a grand left.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.688
{\an3}I've always had a problem
with authority.

29:33.771 --> 29:37.192
{\an1}Uh-huh. Are you sure you're
only in high school?

29:37.275 --> 29:38.860
Hey... Wait, wait, wait.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.987
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
excuse me.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.697
{\an3}A younger woman,
Brandon?

29:42.780 --> 29:44.407
{\an3}Lucinda would be
jealous.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.658
{\an1}Lucinda doesn't
get jealous.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.035
{\an3}Oh, right.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.828
{\an3}I guess she's never
had a reason to.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.455
Who could compete?

29:50.538 --> 29:52.207
Wow, you know,
I just figured out

29:52.290 --> 29:54.667
how this weekend promotes
higher education.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.920
Want to see something strange?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.883
Yeah, it's gonna be hard
to be intimidated

30:01.966 --> 30:04.719
by those guys ever again.

30:04.802 --> 30:07.055
What's even stranger
is seeing you dance.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.431
Hey, this is not dancing.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.390
This is following instructions,

30:09.474 --> 30:12.894
just like making a box
of macaroni and cheese.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.563
You know, the last time
I really danced

30:15.647 --> 30:17.398
was with you,
almost two years ago,

30:17.482 --> 30:18.399
at the Spring Dance.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.734
{\an3}Ew.

30:19.817 --> 30:21.945
Was I that bad?

30:22.028 --> 30:23.863
{\an3}You know what
I'm thinking of?

30:23.947 --> 30:24.906
When I made a move on you.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.534
{\an1}I thought I made
a move on you.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.077
{\an3}No, no, no.
I made a move on you.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.745
What you did
was tell me

30:30.828 --> 30:32.038
{\an3}that we could
never be a couple

30:32.121 --> 30:33.081
{\an3}because I was
like a sister to you.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.208
{\an1}Ooh.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.043
{\an3}It's got to be
the most awful thing

30:37.126 --> 30:39.337
{\an3}any guy has
ever said to me.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.297
Okay, I apologize.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.757
{\an3}(chuckles)

30:42.840 --> 30:43.883
It's too late.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.969
{\an3}But you did do one thing
good that night.

30:46.052 --> 30:49.097
You told me that if we
were perfect strangers,

30:49.180 --> 30:51.599
{\an3}you would be
in love with me.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.226
I did say that, didn't I?

30:53.309 --> 30:55.270
{\an5}CALLER:
The Virginia Reel--
here we go.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.604
Tell me something.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.607
Do you remember everything
everyone ever says to you?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.317
Not everyone.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.944
CALLER:
Right-hand style

31:04.737 --> 31:07.949
And a left-hand style...

(stammering):
Andrea?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.602
Who's Andrea?!

31:35.685 --> 31:36.185
(pronouncing):
Ahn-drea.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.187
Who-Who are you?

31:38.271 --> 31:39.564
She's pregnant.

No kidding.

Andrea? Are you all right?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.612
{\an3}I-I'm a friend
of Steve's.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.488
Uh...

31:47.572 --> 31:49.616
Hi, Kathy. I'm fine.

31:49.699 --> 31:50.992
{\an4}KATHY:
You'll let me know
if you need anything?

31:51.075 --> 31:52.201
{\an1}ANDREA:
Absolutely.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.828
Thank you.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.002
Help her.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.170
{\an1}ANDREA:
Don't you dare.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.548
I'll be, I'll be outside,
waiting.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.556
Steve... Steve!

32:13.640 --> 32:15.183
{\an1}Look, Andrea,
before you say anything--

32:15.266 --> 32:18.478
{\an1}Muntz was the one who stood up
for me when John Sears

32:18.561 --> 32:20.521
{\an1}was trying to get me
kicked out of the KEG House,

32:20.605 --> 32:21.689
and I owed him one.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.523
Steve, I'm touched.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.067
But I can't deal
with you anymore.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.318
Andrea, I'll be homeless.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.152
Better than both of us.

32:26.235 --> 32:29.405
I want you out
by tomorrow morning.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.157
By tomorrow morning.

32:35.244 --> 32:38.706
So, tell me, how did you
and Lucinda get together?

32:38.790 --> 32:39.666
Very normally, actually,

32:39.749 --> 32:42.001
{\an1}and then I found out
she was married.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.712
{\an3}Oh... So much
for serial monogamy.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.547
What's that?

32:46.631 --> 32:49.008
{\an3}One of her
many theories.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.177
Ah.

32:51.260 --> 32:55.515
{\an3}I cannot believe
that you of all people

32:55.598 --> 32:58.393
are sleeping with
a married woman.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.395
I wasn't.

33:00.478 --> 33:04.440
Things got intense
after she got divorced.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.567
Intense is good.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.194
Intense is romantic.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.613
It was romantic.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.824
But, after a while,
it...

33:12.907 --> 33:15.952
{\an1}just kind of feels
like sneaking around.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.204
{\an3}So I guess our
little deceit is

33:18.287 --> 33:20.707
{\an3}the last thing
you need right now?

33:20.790 --> 33:22.917
To tell you the truth,
for the last few hours,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.711
{\an1}I've been thinking
how much nicer it is

33:24.794 --> 33:25.503
{\an1}to be square-dancing
with you

33:25.586 --> 33:28.047
{\an1}than to be hiding out
with Lucinda.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.844
If that's a line,
then you know how to pick 'em.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.638
It's not a line.

33:50.027 --> 33:52.780
Could you just tell me
that I'm like a sister again?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.782
'Cause that would make
things a lot easier.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.830
You know, we have
two people at home

34:00.913 --> 34:02.498
who trust us.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.167
I know.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.969
{\an3}I think I better
walk myself

34:15.052 --> 34:15.303
the rest of the way.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.346
Yeah.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.368
(entrance bell jingles)

34:49.378 --> 34:51.505
A megaburger, please.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.882
I'll get you a waitress.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.884
Nadine.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.178
{\an3}I came here
to talk to you.

34:57.261 --> 34:58.888
At your service.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.181
You know what?

35:00.264 --> 35:01.265
{\an1}I'll handle this myself.
Okay.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.353
I was hoping
for a friendlier reception.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.522
Yeah? Call the Welcome Wagon.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.649
What is wrong with you?

35:09.732 --> 35:11.359
Why'd you leave so
suddenly yesterday?

35:11.442 --> 35:12.401
I shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.196
Well, I thought we were
getting along pretty well

35:15.279 --> 35:18.199
until you jumped up and ran out.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.325
I just don't get it.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.369
It's not that complicated,
is it?

35:21.452 --> 35:23.538
You sleep with me,
I finance your film.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.665
{\an3}Is that what you
think's going on here?

35:25.748 --> 35:26.374
I wasn't trying
to sleep with you

35:26.457 --> 35:29.210
to get you to finance my film.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.546
Dylan, it's
a man-woman thing, see?

35:31.629 --> 35:33.214
I mean, I'm honestly
attracted to you.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.383
Well, I don't doubt that.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.384
See, when you have millions
of dollars, suddenly

35:36.467 --> 35:39.095
you look good
to a lot of people.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.680
Is that how you think
people see you?

35:40.763 --> 35:41.889
In this case?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.975
Absolutely.

35:44.058 --> 35:46.435
Well, that's really sad.

35:46.519 --> 35:48.563
Because you're so wrong.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.406
(bedsprings squeaking
in distance)

36:03.452 --> 36:04.370
(banging)

36:04.453 --> 36:06.372
{\an3}STEVE:
Beat it!

36:08.040 --> 36:09.500
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.256
{\an4}Andrea.
(hushed):
Steve, you are supposed
to be gone.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.424
{\an1}Could you come back later?
No.

36:16.507 --> 36:19.218
I'm going to throw you out
before Kathy Fisher does.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.721
Andrea, this isn't a good time!
Steve, you lie,

36:21.804 --> 36:23.222
you apologize,
you lie, you apologize.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.432
Steve, I'm not going
to lose my room over this!

36:30.855 --> 36:32.607
Kathy.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.984
Andrea...

36:35.067 --> 36:36.152
I was just, uh...

36:36.235 --> 36:38.404
Yeah, I, uh...

36:39.405 --> 36:42.283
...think I got the picture.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.330
{\an1}I was going to get
my nose pierced.

36:47.413 --> 36:50.041
And I thought,

36:50.124 --> 36:52.418
{\an1}you know, how all these
people that look cool now,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.462
{\an1}are gonna end up
middle-aged,

36:54.545 --> 36:58.257
regular jobs and kids

36:58.341 --> 37:00.301
and holes in their noses.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.554
{\an3}Oh, look,
here they come.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.139
Your boyfriend is so cool.

37:05.222 --> 37:06.515
I'll tell him you think so.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.434
So what's he like in bed?

37:08.517 --> 37:11.604
Excuse me?

37:11.687 --> 37:12.813
Well, we're off.

37:12.897 --> 37:13.481
Task force meetings
are gonna seem

37:13.564 --> 37:14.357
a little tame after this.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.318
It will be nice
to get back to normal.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.152
Yes, it will.

37:18.235 --> 37:19.570
{\an3}Clare, it was
a pleasure.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.490
Well, it was nice
to meet both of you.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.493
Kelly, you were
a model roommate.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.535
And Brandon...

37:29.413 --> 37:30.998
<i>A bientôt.</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:33.125
<i>A demain.</i>

37:34.543 --> 37:35.419
CHANCELLOR:
We lived in France three years.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.339
{\an3}She picked up the
kissing thing.

37:38.422 --> 37:42.218
Well, we can just
shake hands, Chancellor.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.387
{\an3}Brandon, we'll see
you two back in town.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.306
Bye.
Bye.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.522
Brandon, I can't play this
dating game anymore.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.191
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

37:57.274 --> 37:58.567
{\an3}I think maybe
last night

37:58.651 --> 38:00.194
might have been my fault.

38:00.277 --> 38:03.197
In a way, I guess I've always
wanted it to happen.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.199
Yeah, me, too.

38:05.282 --> 38:06.534
{\an3}I mean, I'm
glad about it,

38:06.617 --> 38:08.869
but it can't happen again.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.997
Well, maybe,
if you just made yourself

38:11.080 --> 38:12.540
a little less irresistible
next time.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.459
You always know
just what to say.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.469
Come on.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.150
I'm starting to get
a really bad feeling about this.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.234
Look, calm down.

38:40.317 --> 38:42.111
Andrea said she'll take
really good care of him.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.864
I know, but it still
gives me the creeps.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.866
{\an3}All right!
A couple of dog lovers.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.409
{\an3}Can we get you to sign?
Hey! (barks)

38:48.492 --> 38:49.577
Um, sign what?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.996
{\an3}This petition.
It's for animal rights.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.915
Oh, my God.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.209
{\an3}That's what we're
trying to stop.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.586
They call it
research, right?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.921
{\an3}But what they're doing
is burning animals,

39:01.005 --> 39:03.424
{\an1}electrocuting them,
microwaving them,

39:03.507 --> 39:05.092
{\an4}blinding them...
I don't want
to hear this.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.260
No, I know...
Nobody does.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.637
{\an5}But that's what's
being done in the
name of science.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.264
That's right--
but mostly, all it does

39:10.347 --> 39:11.265
is confirm what we already know.

39:11.348 --> 39:12.558
I mean, why force
cigarette smoke

39:12.641 --> 39:14.602
into more dogs' lungs
just to show,

39:14.685 --> 39:16.645
yet again, that smoking

39:16.729 --> 39:17.938
is bad for you?

39:18.022 --> 39:19.315
I read about this.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.400
Don't they cut holes
in dogs' throats or something?

39:21.484 --> 39:23.110
{\an3}Yeah, that's right.
Once people know the facts,

39:23.194 --> 39:24.779
they want it stopped.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.238
{\an3}I'm Allan.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.656
{\an6}Hi.
This is Jonathan
and Janet.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.617
Hi.
Hi, I'm Brenda.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.827
{\an1}This is Donna and Rocky.
Hi.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.954
Hi.
Listen, there's a vote next week

39:34.038 --> 39:35.289
by the board
of regents to forbid

39:35.373 --> 39:36.832
animal testing
on this campus,

39:36.916 --> 39:38.292
so, would you please
sign this petition?

39:38.375 --> 39:38.709
{\an1}Sure.
Yeah.

39:38.793 --> 39:39.668
Hi, you guys.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.130
ANDREA:
Hi, Rocky, how you doing?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.132
I don't suppose
you'd sign our petition?

39:45.216 --> 39:45.633
You're right. I wouldn't.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.135
Shall we?

39:48.219 --> 39:49.470
Come on.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.805
Wait-wait-wait,
wait, wait!

39:50.888 --> 39:52.306
JANET:
Stop, you can't

39:52.389 --> 39:53.307
do this!

39:53.390 --> 39:54.975
You're taking him in?

39:55.059 --> 39:55.518
{\an3}We have to.
He escaped from the lab.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.645
They'll destroy him.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.855
Look, I know you guys have
the right to stand here

39:59.939 --> 40:01.148
and spread your lies,
all right...

40:01.232 --> 40:02.274
{\an3}It's not a lie.
Yes, it is.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.276
Do you know what we do?

40:04.360 --> 40:06.320
Research to save lives.

40:06.403 --> 40:08.030
You research unnecessarily.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.991
Look, you guys, we have already
gone through this.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.285
You know why it's important
for us to return him.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.247
{\an1}You know maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.832
Bren...

40:17.915 --> 40:19.583
Don't do it.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.922
Bye, Rachmaninoff.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.845
Donna, who are you going
to believe?

40:42.064 --> 40:43.023
Bye-bye, Rocky.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.109
Andrea's gonna take care
of you now, okay?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.528
Come on, Rocky.

40:47.611 --> 40:48.821
Come on.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.156
Good boy.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.043
{\an5}BRENDA:
<i>I mean, it's not like</i>
<i>animal rights</i>

41:03.127 --> 41:03.669
is a new thing.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.546
I mean, listen to this.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.715
"Leonardo da Vinci,

41:07.798 --> 41:08.549
{\an3}"Albert Einstein,
Charles Darwin,

41:08.632 --> 41:11.218
William Wordsworth..."

41:11.302 --> 41:12.094
{\an1}Hey, wait a minute,
we talked about Wordsworth

41:12.178 --> 41:13.679
{\an1}in poetry class;
you said he was deranged.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.181
Come on.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.016
{\an1}Animals deserve to have
someone speak up for them.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.100
KELLY:
What about that gorilla lady

41:18.184 --> 41:20.853
{\an3}who was teaching them
to speak up for themselves?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.898
Guys, I'm going
to personally go

41:23.981 --> 41:26.192
{\an3}and buy you a new dog,
just so I don't have

41:26.275 --> 41:27.735
to listen to this anymore.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.070
(doorbell rings)

41:30.154 --> 41:32.865
Sorry. I guess we have
been kind of going on.

41:32.948 --> 41:34.909
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:34.992 --> 41:35.951
(door opens)

41:36.035 --> 41:37.119
{\an1}DONNA:
Rocky!

41:37.203 --> 41:38.037
(Rocky barks)

41:38.120 --> 41:39.914
What are you doing here?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.749
I missed you so much.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.751
Hey, pup, I thought
I'd never see you again.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.920
Hey, looks like
you've got to be

41:46.003 --> 41:46.587
a dog to get any
attention around here.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.714
{\an3}Oh, hi, Jesse.
Hey, Brenda.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.300
{\an1}Oh, you guys,
how can you turn your back

41:51.383 --> 41:53.010
on a face like this?

41:53.093 --> 41:55.095
It kind of makes you want
to grow fur, doesn't it?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.389
No.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.433
BRENDA:
So Andrea, what happened?

41:59.516 --> 42:00.643
Well, they said since he got
outside of the control group,

42:00.726 --> 42:04.230
he was worthless to them,
clinically speaking that is, so,

42:04.313 --> 42:05.689
if you want him, he's yours.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.108
(David playing
Rachmaninoff music)

42:08.192 --> 42:09.777
{\an3}I'd say they do.
(Rocky barks)

42:10.819 --> 42:13.113
JESSE:
So Brandon, I understand

42:13.197 --> 42:13.739
you had a wild weekend.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.741
Excuse me?

42:15.824 --> 42:16.784
75 policy wonks
at a hoedown?

42:16.867 --> 42:19.745
{\an5}JESSE:
Whoo-ha!
BRANDON:
Ah, the retreat.

42:19.828 --> 42:20.621
Yes, Kelly and I went

42:20.704 --> 42:23.123
and we're kind
of a big item now.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.291
Isn't that right, Kel?

42:25.334 --> 42:26.627
Yeah, Bran, thanks

42:26.710 --> 42:29.296
{\an1}for the, uh, return
of my girlfriend.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.631
Thanks for the loan, brother.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.800
Ah, what are friends for?
You know, Brandon and I

42:32.883 --> 42:34.677
{\an3}told you about our
weekend in paradise.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.970
{\an3}Mm-hmm.
What about you?

42:36.053 --> 42:38.013
{\an3}Did Lucinda hit
the jackpot?

42:38.097 --> 42:39.765
Not exactly.

42:39.848 --> 42:43.978
{\an3}Looks like I'm going to have
to do a little persuading.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.396
(Rachmaninoff music
continues)

42:48.357 --> 42:50.359
Well, I'm out of here, guys.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.987
{\an1}Where are you
sneaking off to?

42:53.070 --> 42:54.321
This is not sneaking, Brenda.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.156
{\an3}This is commonly
referred to as walking.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.241
See ya, Brandon.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.620
{\an1}See you, guys.
Good to see you.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.330
{\an3}Take care.
<i>Adio.</i>

43:03.414 --> 43:05.416
(door opens and closes)

43:09.378 --> 43:11.380
(knocking on door)

43:15.592 --> 43:17.052
Did you miss me?

43:17.136 --> 43:19.138
You first.

43:22.599 --> 43:26.645
I thought about you
all weekend long.
