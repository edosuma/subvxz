WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.413
Previously on Lost:

00:04.046 --> 00:05.206
When you were over there,

00:05.298 --> 00:07.789
you mentioned Widmore had someone
guarding a room on his submarine.

00:07.884 --> 00:10.421
Guarding something that
he didn't want you to see?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.500
Yeah, so?

00:12.847 --> 00:13.962
I don't like secrets.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.182
You told me you brought me here to the
island to do something very important.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.306
When do we start?

00:23.816 --> 00:25.192
Run.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.777
These people are extremely dangerous.
We need to go now.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.104
Lead the way.

00:31.949 --> 00:35.362
This man wants to leave the island,
that plane's the only way he can do it.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.364
Wanna know where we're going?
We're gonna stop him.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.241
How are you gonna stop him
from getting on the plane?

00:39.332 --> 00:40.492
We have to destroy it.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.580
In a world of conflict and strife,

00:45.671 --> 00:48.378
there is but one fact
we all can agree upon:

00:49.634 --> 00:52.091
Everybody loves Hugo.

00:54.222 --> 00:59.012
Born to humble surroundings, Hugo Reyes
has always been a beacon of light

00:59.101 --> 01:00.602
for all who crossed his path.

01:01.771 --> 01:04.729
Hugo's lifelong love affair
with chicken

01:04.815 --> 01:08.649
led him to acquire and
then expand the Mr. Cluck's chain

01:08.736 --> 01:10.897
into a worldwide phenomenon.

01:10.988 --> 01:14.901
The exponential growth
of Hugo's success was startling.

01:15.493 --> 01:20.533
But financial success wasn't the end,
it was the beginning.

01:21.374 --> 01:24.958
Hugo and giving became synonymous.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.915
Parks... playgrounds...

01:29.006 --> 01:30.212
...hospitals. ..

01:30.841 --> 01:33.048
...the Mr. Cluck's House for Children.

01:33.970 --> 01:38.805
The philanthropy was unparalleled.
Which brings us to this evening

01:38.891 --> 01:42.930
and the opening of the
Hugo Reyes Paleontology Wing

01:43.020 --> 01:46.103
at the Golden State
Natural History Museum,

01:46.190 --> 01:49.603
a lasting beacon of culture
that bears the name

01:49.694 --> 01:52.356
of one of our city's
greatest benefactors.

01:55.366 --> 02:00.451
Ladies and gentlemen,
our Man of the Year, Hugo Reyes!

02:19.557 --> 02:21.047
It's a pretty cool trophy, huh?

02:22.393 --> 02:25.351
You know we got the Human Fund
next Saturday night. Can you make it?

02:25.855 --> 02:29.723
Another trophy.
Everybody loves Hugo.

02:30.735 --> 02:33.477
You know who doesn't? Women.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.237
- Ma!
- You need a woman in your life,

02:37.325 --> 02:41.238
- especially one who has not nursed you.
- That's disgusting.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.371
- And I'm too busy to meet someone.
- You're not too busy.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.699
- You're too scared.
- I'm not scared.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.000
Good, because you have a date tomorrow.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.455
- I do?
- Grandpa Tito's neighbor's daughter,

02:54.550 --> 02:57.462
Rosalita. She agreed to lunch with you.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.179
- What's she like?
- Willing to meet you.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.256
- Ma.
- You're going!

03:03.934 --> 03:06.016
She's gonna love you.

03:06.103 --> 03:10.893
And if she doesn't,
we will find someone who does.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.408
A lot of crazy stuff's been happening.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.247
I kinda wish I could
talk to you about it in person.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.843
A lot of people have come
to talk to me after they've...

03:43.432 --> 03:45.263
...you know, gone.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.093
It would be nice if you did, too.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.356
Hugo?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.605
You ready to go?

03:54.318 --> 03:57.105
- Once I'm back, we're leaving.
- Where you going?

03:57.196 --> 04:00.780
The Black Rock. If we're gonna
destroy that plane, we'll need dynamite.

04:01.784 --> 04:05.777
- You sure that's the right move?
- No. But it's the only move we have.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.997
Well, you're the expert.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.326
Whose grave is this?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.748
Her name was Libby. She was
in the tail section of the plane.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.005
We were gonna have our first date.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.717
It was gonna be, like, a picnic.

04:28.561 --> 04:31.519
But... then she was murdered.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.439
I'm sorry.

04:39.697 --> 04:41.187
Yeah, me, too.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.200
Hey.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.044
What are you doing here?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.801
I'm here to stop you
from getting everyone killed.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.912
You gonna say something?

05:36.086 --> 05:37.337
And why should I trust you?

05:38.297 --> 05:41.505
- You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.
- That doesn't matter right now.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.130
What matters is you going across
that island to blow up that plane.

05:45.221 --> 05:48.634
People are gonna die. A lot of people,
and it's gonna be your fault.

05:48.724 --> 05:49.759
What?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.967
Because people are listening
to you now, Hurley.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.178
Hurley.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.273
Who are you talking to?

06:03.405 --> 06:04.656
No one.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.278
Come on. We're leaving.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.840
Can I get you some more
homemade tortilla chips?

06:26.178 --> 06:27.167
Sure. Whatever.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.299
Can you leave those?
I'm meeting someone.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.885
- She's running late.
- Right. Chips are on the way.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.650
Hugo?

06:53.747 --> 06:57.114
Hi. Nice to meet you. Wow.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.790
- I wasn't expecting someone like you.
- I'm sorry?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.917
You know, someone who's so... pretty.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.923
Please. Have a seat.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.469
You don't look like a Rosalita.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.470
My name isn't Rosalita. It's Libby.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.682
So... you're not my blind date?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.685
No, | just saw you from across the room.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.859
Well, how'd you know my name?

07:32.328 --> 07:35.695
Well, if I tell you,
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.165
No, I won't.

07:44.340 --> 07:49.209
Hugo, do you believe
that two people can be connected...

07:51.347 --> 07:52.837
...like soul mates?

07:56.268 --> 07:57.553
I guess.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.354
You don't remember me, do you?

08:05.069 --> 08:06.309
Should I?

08:07.196 --> 08:08.857
What are you doing, Elizabeth?

08:08.947 --> 08:12.815
- Are you bothering this man?
- No. No, he's an old friend.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.571
We just... Wait. What's going on?

08:14.662 --> 08:16.823
I apologize for the intrusion. Come on.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.121
- Dr. Brooks, ifl could just...
- Doctor?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.494
- I'm sorry. She just wandered off.
- Wandered off from where?

08:21.585 --> 08:26.875
Everything that I said, Hugo...
I meant it.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.173
Forgive us.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.019
Yeah, just four of us.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.245
All right, let's go.
We have to make it to the outriggers

09:07.339 --> 09:09.830
and across the channel to
Hydra island before nightfall.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.916
- You have the dynamite?
- Four sticks...

09:12.636 --> 09:15.673
Enough to destroy the cockpit
and all the instruments.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.675
That plane'll never fly.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.598
I don't know if that's a good idea.

09:21.145 --> 09:23.181
For one thing,
that stuff's really unstable.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.605
You have to trust me. I've been
training my whole life for this.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.648
- To blow stuff up?
- To protect you.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.148
Yeah, but how is blowing up
the plane protecting us?

09:32.197 --> 09:35.155
With that plane gone, that thing
won't be able to leave the island.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.743
Yeah, well, neither will we,

09:36.827 --> 09:39.409
then we'll be stuck here with it,
and it'll be angry at us.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.283
Jacob said Richard
would know what to do.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.615
And Richard said to
blow up the plane. Correct?

09:44.710 --> 09:46.041
Yes.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.665
Well, Jacob never said
anything about it to me.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.500
I mean, what if Richard's wrong?

09:51.592 --> 09:54.675
Hugo, I'm looking out
for your best interests, all of you.

09:55.471 --> 09:59.134
Nothing is more important than this.
That thing is evil,

09:59.224 --> 10:01.681
and God help us if it ever
leaves this island, bec...

10:20.037 --> 10:21.698
That gonna be a spear?

10:24.208 --> 10:26.199
I'm not sure what
it's gonna be yet, James.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.878
- When the time is right, it'll tell me.
- You talk to wood now?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.249
- Sawyer.
- What?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.422
Something I can do for you two?

10:38.514 --> 10:40.721
Is there something you can do?
How about anything?

10:41.767 --> 10:45.931
Those bastards grabbed Jin. We're just
sitting around, doin' nothin' about it.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.889
There's a difference between
doing nothing and waiting.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.224
So what are we waiting for?

10:56.073 --> 10:59.565
You were only able to come back to
this island because you did it together.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.736
If we're gonna get on that plane and
leave, it has to happen the same way.

11:04.748 --> 11:09.538
We're waiting for your friends
to get here, Kate. Hugo, Sun, Jack.

11:10.379 --> 11:15.123
That's the only way we're ever
getting off this godforsaken rock.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.755
- Well, I don't see that happening.
- Well, let's just hope you're wrong.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.305
Where you been?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.770
Can I speak to you in private?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.439
Absolutely.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.624
- Everything go all right?
- Yes.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.623
Did Widmore see you?

11:58.302 --> 12:01.009
- No, but his people did.
- And you let them live?

12:01.096 --> 12:03.838
I didn't see the point of killing them
when I had what I came for.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.173
So you found what
they were hiding in the submarine?

12:07.519 --> 12:08.975
| most certainly did.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.182
Now what?

12:57.819 --> 13:00.151
We get more dynamite
or else she died for nothing.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.729
Maybe she died to show us
to stay away from dynamite.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.156
Well, Jack, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.201
Richard, I promised Sun
that I'd get her off this island.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.404
Well, Jack, I wish you hadn't done that.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.033
- If it makes you feel better, blame me.
- I think Richard's right.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.839
It's the only choice we've got.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.881
Trust me, Jack.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.809
OK.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.636
Good. Let's get moving.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.361
Thirty-eight. Number 38?

13:45.659 --> 13:50.779
- Mr. Reyes! What an honor.
- Give me a bucket, family size.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.203
Of course. Right away, sir.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.580
Forty-one? Number 41?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.549
What?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.223
I'm sorry.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.182
- Have I seen you before?
- I own the place.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.980
Maybe you saw my commercial.
You want a Clucketeer keychain?

14:20.110 --> 14:21.600
No. It's not that.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.272
Were you on Oceanic flight 815?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.608
- About a week ago, from Sydney?
- Yeah.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.577
- So was I.
- Wow. What a coincidence.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.280
Listen, you mind if I join you
while I wait for my order?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.956
- Be my guest.
- That is a lot of chicken.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.714
- | eat when I'm depressed.
- So what's her name?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.423
I met a girl on a blind date
the other night.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.344
And it didn't go how you'd hoped?

14:52.100 --> 14:55.388
She was totally awesome,
except for one thing, she's crazy.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.850
All women are a little bit crazy.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.728
No. This one actually lives
in the looney bin.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.606
I mean, I saw the van.
She's full-on nuts.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.904
I mean, she started sane,

15:07.991 --> 15:11.779
but then she told me that we
already knew each other. And that?

15:11.870 --> 15:12.985
l'd remember.

15:15.957 --> 15:20.667
Tell me something. Did you believe her
when she said she knew you?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.508
Yeah.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.504
Kinda.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.465
You know, I say go with your gut.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.139
You know, maybe you should...

15:35.227 --> 15:38.219
You should try to find out
where she thinks she knew you from...

15:39.689 --> 15:41.429
...before you give up on her.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.108
Forty-two? Order 42?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.694
That's me, brother. Well...

15:52.536 --> 15:54.117
It was nice bumping into you.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.172
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.965
I'm sorry Sayid tied you up,

16:09.052 --> 16:11.794
but he was afraid you'd run
before we had a chance to talk.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.096
I don't blame him. Although as
I explained to him before he left...

16:16.852 --> 16:18.638
...l have nowhere to run to, brother.

16:21.356 --> 16:25.349
Well, if that's not the best argument
against captivity that I've ever heard,

16:25.443 --> 16:27.024
I don't know what is.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.874
You mind ifl ask you
a couple questions, Desmond?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.370
Not at all.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.957
Why did Charles Widmore
bring you back to the island?

16:47.382 --> 16:51.625
Considering l was kidnapped...
you'd have to ask him.

16:55.056 --> 16:59.220
- They had him under armed guard.
- He threw me into a wood shack

16:59.311 --> 17:02.098
and blasted me with a
massive amount of electromagnetism.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.222
If you don't mind my asking, Desmond,

17:06.318 --> 17:09.435
how can you be sure what it was
that he blasted you with?

17:10.447 --> 17:11.653
Experience.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.865
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.161
You're John Locke.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.257
Head back to camp. I'll be back soon.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.677
- Where are you going?
- Desmond and I need to take a walk.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.560
Something I'd like to show you.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.739
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.987
- What's that?
- llana.

18:00.205 --> 18:03.993
There she was, handpicked by Jacob...

18:05.168 --> 18:08.001
...trained to come
and protect you candidates.

18:09.673 --> 18:15.418
No sooner does she tell you
who you are... then she blows up.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.678
The island was done with her.

18:21.142 --> 18:24.384
Makes me wonder what's gonna happen
when it's done with us.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.411
All right, everyone.
This might take a few minutes.

18:47.752 --> 18:51.336
I don't want anyone but me handling
that dynamite, so I'm gonna go in alone.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.915
- Where's Hugo?
- I thought he was up front with you.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.216
Run!

18:57.804 --> 19:00.762
Run! Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.360
Why the hell did you do that?!

19:25.832 --> 19:27.072
I'm protecting us.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.169
- What were you thinking?!
- Calm down.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.588
- What're we supposed to do now?
- That's enough.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.131
We're all dead.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.006
Awarning might have been nice, Hugo.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.384
I did say "run."

19:50.315 --> 19:53.273
- Why'd you do that?
- Michael told me to.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.685
- Who?
- Michael.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.984
One of the people who come back
and yell at me after they die.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.617
He told me I had to stop everyone
from blowing up the plane.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.447
So... no dynamite, no more blowing up.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.126
That happen a lot?
Dead people yelling at you?

20:14.631 --> 20:15.746
It happens enough.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.503
And you just listen
to whatever they say?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.222
Dead people are more reliable
than alive people.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.637
How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?

20:29.771 --> 20:34.390
I wanted to ask you about
that girl the other day. Libby?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.314
l was wondering if,
maybe, I could see her.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.322
Well, I don't think that's a good idea.
She's not well.

20:43.410 --> 20:48.245
Clearly, she's well enough for,
like, a fajita field trip.

20:48.331 --> 20:52.165
Well, that's my mistake.
I misjudged her condition.

20:53.503 --> 20:57.291
- Her condition?
- She has issues with reality.

20:57.382 --> 21:01.421
- What do you mean?
- | just think it probably

21:01.511 --> 21:04.969
wouldn't be a good idea
for you to see her right now.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.342
- lt'll only confuse her.
- You said "probably,"

21:07.434 --> 21:09.891
which means you might
make an exception.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.260
Well, perhaps for family.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.770
Or a generous donor?

21:15.859 --> 21:16.939
I'm sorry?

21:21.156 --> 21:23.397
The rec room looked
pretty gnarly on my way in.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.232
What do you think 100K might buy?

21:54.481 --> 21:55.470
You remembered?

21:57.150 --> 21:59.983
No. I'm sorry.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.857
Then why are you here?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.696
Where is it you think you know me from?

22:10.288 --> 22:11.573
I'm not sure. I...

22:13.666 --> 22:15.281
I know it won't make sense.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.750
Try me.

22:24.260 --> 22:28.879
A few days ago, l was watching TV,
and one of your commercials came on.

22:28.973 --> 22:33.137
And the moment that I saw you,
it was like I was hit over the head.

22:33.228 --> 22:37.141
All these memories came washing back,

22:37.232 --> 22:40.770
of my life, only it was...

22:43.530 --> 22:44.986
...another life.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.357
What kind of memories?

22:52.705 --> 22:56.539
There was a plane crash. And...

22:57.919 --> 22:59.500
...l was on an island.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.038
And l was there?

23:03.132 --> 23:06.716
I think so. We... knew each other.

23:06.803 --> 23:10.387
We... liked each other.

23:12.809 --> 23:17.803
And then when I got here,
it was almost like I'd been here before.

23:17.897 --> 23:22.561
And for some reason, Hugo,
l have a memory of you being here, too.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.481
This is the first time I've
ever been in a mental hospital.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.033
Yeah. I know. But I can't
get you out of my brain.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.328
That's why, the other night,
when I saw you, I had to talk to you,

23:35.415 --> 23:38.327
because if you remembered me...

23:44.465 --> 23:48.003
| wish I could, Libby, but... I can't.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.512
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.344
It's OK.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.934
- I'm crazy.
- Yeah, probably, but...

24:02.525 --> 24:04.106
We all got something, right?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.353
I mean, it takes guts to go up
to a total stranger

24:08.448 --> 24:13.283
and tell them you know them
from some bizarro alternate universe.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.043
I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.204
You're doing fine.

24:33.598 --> 24:37.716
Hey, can you ever, like...
get outta here?

24:39.729 --> 24:43.221
- On a day pass or...
- Yeah. I'm here voluntarily.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.564
Well...

24:47.111 --> 24:50.194
Would you like to... do something?

24:51.658 --> 24:55.526
You mean... a date?

24:58.623 --> 24:59.908
Yeah.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.955
I'd love that.

25:10.259 --> 25:14.878
Remind me, Desmond, how long were you
down in that hatch, pushing that button?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.098
Three years.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.094
And here you are, back for more.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.768
lfl didn't know better,
I'd say this island has it in for you.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.346
- Do you know better?
- Excuse me?

25:25.441 --> 25:27.557
There's nothing special
about me, brother.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.108
This island has it in for all of us.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.823
Yes, it does.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.399
What?

25:37.995 --> 25:39.451
Who's that?

25:42.166 --> 25:44.578
Just ignore him.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.915
- Do you know that boy?
- I said ignore him.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.266
Where you going?

26:02.353 --> 26:07.723
Back at the Dharma barracks, there's
still grenades there? Explosives?

26:07.817 --> 26:10.183
- Yes, I think so.
- Then that's where we're going.

26:10.278 --> 26:13.736
- Maybe we should talk about this.
- Talk? There's no time to talk,

26:13.823 --> 26:16.815
but if you know what we need to do,
if you know how we stop that thing

26:16.909 --> 26:19.867
from leaving the island without
blowing that plane up, let's hear it.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.239
I know what we need to do.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.905
Really? What's that?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.914
- We have to talk to Locke.
- Are you trying to get us killed?

26:29.005 --> 26:32.543
It's not my idea. It's his.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.761
- Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.
- Jacob's here, right now?

26:42.852 --> 26:44.262
Yeah.

26:49.025 --> 26:52.017
- Ask him what the island is.
- What?

26:53.571 --> 26:55.732
A while back, Jacob told me
what the island was,

26:55.823 --> 26:58.610
if he's really standing here,
next to me, then just ask him.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.828
I don't have to prove
anything to you, Richard.

27:13.174 --> 27:17.713
You either come with me or
you can keep trying to blow stuff up.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.254
Your call, dude.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.477
He's lying.

27:28.564 --> 27:32.182
Jacob isn't telling us what to do
because Jacob never tells us what to do.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.812
I'm gonna make this simple.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.191
If that thing leaves the island,
that's it. It's over.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.021
- What's over?
- Everything.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.904
I'm destroying that plane,
and I can use all the help I can get.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.285
Who's coming with me?

27:50.670 --> 27:51.750
I am.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.010
I saw that thing in action, man.
It doesn't want to talk.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.385
Sorry.

28:08.396 --> 28:09.636
Anyone else?

28:12.984 --> 28:16.602
Sorry, Richard. lf Jacob says we go
talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.313
- I'm going with Hugo.
- Really?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.244
Don't get in our way.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.286
All right, Hurley.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.834
Let's go talk to Locke.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.399
Probably.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.658
So what do you think we should...

29:07.496 --> 29:09.157
...say to Locke when we get there?

29:10.499 --> 29:14.208
I mean, how do you break the ice
with the smoke monster?

29:15.254 --> 29:16.835
I wouldn't worry about it.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.835
Something tells me he's
gonna do most of the talking.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.175
Or he could just kill us all.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.844
Yeah, he could.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.674
I didn't see Jacob back there.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.553
ljust said it 'cause
I wanted everyone to listen to me.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.524
- I know.
- Then why'd you come with me?

29:41.530 --> 29:44.146
Ever since Juliet died,

29:44.241 --> 29:46.277
ever since I got her killed...

29:47.662 --> 29:49.527
...all I've wanted was to fix it.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.370
But I can't... I can't ever fix it.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.587
You have no idea how hard it is
for me to sit back,

30:00.675 --> 30:03.087
and listen to other people
tell me what I should do.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.468
But I think, maybe, that's the point.

30:07.765 --> 30:08.880
Maybe...

30:10.685 --> 30:12.391
Maybe I'm supposed to let go.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.851
Unless you letting go gets us killed.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.769
Going to see Locke was my idea,
not Jacob's.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.690
Hurley, you asked me to trust you.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.988
This is me trusting you.

30:32.540 --> 30:36.624
Well, it's a good thing you do, dude,
'cause I have no idea where I'm going.

30:45.219 --> 30:48.552
Wait. It's cool. I think
I know what these things are.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.631
Oh, yeah? What the hell are they?

30:52.435 --> 30:53.675
Wait here.

31:06.157 --> 31:07.613
Hey. You around?

31:08.659 --> 31:09.819
Michael?

31:17.501 --> 31:19.412
You're stuck on the island, aren't you?

31:20.337 --> 31:23.044
- Because of what I did.
- And...

31:24.258 --> 31:27.967
...there are others out here like you,
aren't there?

31:29.597 --> 31:31.133
That's what the whispers are?

31:32.475 --> 31:36.434
Yeah. We're the ones who can't move on.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.100
Do you know where Locke is?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.146
There.

31:51.535 --> 31:52.911
Thanks.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.535
ls...

31:56.499 --> 32:00.162
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

32:00.836 --> 32:02.292
Don't get yourself killed.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.251
OK.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.000
And, Hurley?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.802
If you ever do see Libby again...

32:22.483 --> 32:24.144
Tell her I'm very sorry.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.025
I'll be sure and do that, dude.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.327
I got, like, six different
kinds of cheeses.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.125
I don't know what they are, but the
lady at the store said they were good...

32:45.506 --> 32:49.419
I figured you'd like cheese
because everybody likes cheese.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.269
- Have you been here before?
- No.

33:08.362 --> 33:11.695
It's just... being here with you
feels so familiar.

33:11.782 --> 33:15.274
It's like a date we never had.

33:18.122 --> 33:20.784
Wow. I sound completely insane, don't I?

33:21.750 --> 33:22.956
No.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.747
Not completely.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.253
Why do you even wanna be with me?

33:30.426 --> 33:31.586
Why you wanna be with me?

33:32.261 --> 33:33.250
What?

33:34.597 --> 33:35.962
Come on. Look at me.

33:38.017 --> 33:42.386
I want to be with you
because I like you.

33:44.732 --> 33:48.190
Yeah, but... you like me because...

33:51.488 --> 33:53.820
...well, you're... delusional.

34:12.927 --> 34:14.167
What? What's wrong?

34:21.268 --> 34:22.474
- Dude.
- What?

34:31.528 --> 34:33.519
I think I'm remembering stuff.

34:34.990 --> 34:35.979
You are?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.740
You mean I'm not crazy?

34:44.208 --> 34:46.073
No, I don't think you are.

35:13.404 --> 35:14.769
We're here.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.076
- What is it?
- It's a well.

35:38.929 --> 35:42.046
Let me guess...
You're wondering how deep it is.

35:43.892 --> 35:44.927
You read my mind.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.030
You have any idea how old
this well is, Desmond?

35:57.990 --> 35:59.321
Very old?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.533
That's exactly right. Very old.

36:05.289 --> 36:11.285
So old, in fact, that the people who
dug this well did it completely by hand.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.871
God knows how long it took 'em.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.172
Seems like a lot of work
just to get some water.

36:17.259 --> 36:18.965
Oh, they weren't looking for water.

36:20.054 --> 36:21.544
They were looking for answers.

36:22.765 --> 36:26.257
A long time ago, places like
the one we're standing at right now

36:26.352 --> 36:28.934
made compass needles spin.

36:29.438 --> 36:35.308
And the people holding the compasses
needed to know why, so they dug.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.228
Did they find
what they were looking for?

36:39.323 --> 36:41.564
No, they didn't.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.783
The reason I wanted you
to see this, Desmond,

36:47.873 --> 36:52.537
is because Charles Widmore
is not interested in answers.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.459
He's only interested in power.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.125
And he brought you back to this island

36:57.216 --> 37:00.253
so you could help him
find what he's looking for.

37:00.344 --> 37:02.960
After all, this isn't the only well.

37:06.016 --> 37:10.100
And that's the reason
you wanted me to see this?

37:13.065 --> 37:14.475
Why aren't you afraid?

37:16.402 --> 37:17.391
Excuse me?

37:19.530 --> 37:24.399
You're out here,
middle of the jungle, with me.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.659
Not a person on earth
even knows you're here.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.328
Why aren't you afraid?

37:33.877 --> 37:35.708
What is the point in being afraid?

37:58.026 --> 37:59.357
How is our friend?

38:00.487 --> 38:02.523
We don't have to
worry about him anymore.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.706
Where you been?

38:12.499 --> 38:14.455
I went for a walk, James.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.455
Now that you've stretched
your legs, maybe you...

38:23.302 --> 38:24.917
Son of a bitch.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.931
- Hey.
- Hello, Hugo.

38:41.737 --> 38:44.069
I don't know who you are, dude,

38:44.156 --> 38:48.399
or what you want,
but we have to talk to you.

38:49.870 --> 38:50.905
"We"?

38:52.581 --> 38:54.071
There are other people with me.

38:58.420 --> 39:02.038
But, the thing is,
you got weapons and we got weapons,

39:02.132 --> 39:06.341
and I don't want anyone
to get hurt... or killed.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.179
So we're not gonna do anything...

39:13.101 --> 39:15.387
...and I want your word
that you're not, either.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.397
You have my word.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.614
OK, guys. Come on out.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.607
Hello, Jack.

40:33.557 --> 40:34.637
Hello there.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.933
Are you waiting
for someone in particular?

40:39.438 --> 40:41.599
- Excuse me?
- You've been parked here a while,

40:41.690 --> 40:45.524
watching the kids,
and, well, it is a school.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.065
Do you have a child who goes here?

40:51.033 --> 40:54.867
No. No. lwas...
| just moved to the neighborhood...

40:56.079 --> 40:58.240
...and I'm looking
for a school for my son.

40:58.332 --> 41:00.118
- What's your son's name?
- Charlie.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.872
Well, as a teacher here,
I can vouch for it completely.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.794
It's a wonderful school.

41:07.591 --> 41:11.630
That's great to hear. Thanks.
Well, it was nice talking to you.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.053
Have a good day.

41:38.747 --> 41:42.831
Call 911! Do it now! Mr. Locke?

41:43.669 --> 41:45.250
Oh, my God.

41:45.337 --> 41:48.829
Don't move. We're gonna get you
to the hospital. Mr. Locke?

41:49.925 --> 41:51.881
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
