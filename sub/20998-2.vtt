Work all day, party tonight.

00:03.130 --> 00:05.164
My ass is gonna be shaking.

00:05.166 --> 00:06.899
This feels like old times.

Oh, give it.

Hey, one more run, huh?

00:10.304 --> 00:13.038
I promise you Uncle Daddy's
gonna hook you up tonight.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.740
Another run, huh?

00:15.576 --> 00:17.810
We did 11K yesterday.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.048
Roller, I could go to the fed

00:23.050 --> 00:24.416
for washing money for y'all.

00:24.418 --> 00:25.851
- Mm-hmm.
- ‭This is not what we agreed upon.

00:25.853 --> 00:28.320
It was supposed to be 20K
and then I was out.

00:28.322 --> 00:29.555
‭Where my money?

00:29.557 --> 00:31.257
I want my money, Roller.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.859
You owe me. Des, I don't owe you shit.

00:33.861 --> 00:38.063
Baby, baby, squeeze my neck.

00:42.670 --> 00:43.669
You like that, huh?!

00:43.671 --> 00:46.438
You want me to squeeze your neck?

00:46.440 --> 00:48.007
Ohh!

00:48.009 --> 00:49.241
Ohh!

00:53.881 --> 00:55.781
Now am I in your little crew?

00:58.452 --> 01:01.020
What the did we do?

01:01.789 --> 01:03.455
Help me get him out.

01:18.532 --> 01:20.766
as far away from here as we can.

01:20.768 --> 01:22.801
I mean, that's what
you're supposed to do, right?

01:22.803 --> 01:24.703
Yeah, I guess. The...

01:24.705 --> 01:26.171
Maybe we should take him to the swamp?

01:26.173 --> 01:28.574
That's too far. Um...

01:28.576 --> 01:29.808
Uh...

01:33.781 --> 01:34.880
Bingo.

01:37.751 --> 01:40.052

01:44.024 --> 01:46.692
Maybe lose those clear heels
for one minute?

01:46.694 --> 01:48.861
- I can't walk on my bare feet.
- Take them off!

01:48.863 --> 01:51.096
Fine. Shit. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh

Well, at least he won't be lonely.

02:39.313 --> 02:41.914

- Lighter fluid?

02:41.916 --> 02:43.895

Go look by the grill.

Y-You still have your old place, right?

03:47.881 --> 03:49.815
Yeah. Most of my stuff is still there.

03:49.817 --> 03:53.385
Go there tonight, a-a-and I will
pick you up tomorrow.

03:53.387 --> 03:55.120
- Listen!
- ‭What? What?

03:55.122 --> 03:56.162
I'll pick you up in the morning

03:56.187 --> 03:57.614
- and take you to the salon. ‭
- Okay.

03:57.616 --> 03:59.224
I will figure out
what to tell the girls.

03:59.226 --> 04:00.645
We don't people to think that we were

04:00.670 --> 04:02.789
- fighting over the deceased.
- Okay.

04:02.791 --> 04:04.029
And then I should probably...

04:04.031 --> 04:05.864
should probably shoot this place up

04:05.866 --> 04:07.466
and make it look like
some shit went down.

04:07.468 --> 04:09.668
Yeah, I guess. I'm gonna grab
my stuff from the bedroom.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.003
Wait! Then leave some of it

04:11.005 --> 04:12.971
'cause people knew
‭that y'all were together.

04:12.973 --> 04:14.806
Okay, Nancy Drew.

04:19.146 --> 04:20.379

04:20.380 --> 04:21.680
Give it to me.

Oh, my God! Be careful!

04:29.223 --> 04:31.123
What are you doing?!

04:31.125 --> 04:32.891
Oh, God!

04:36.297 --> 04:38.463
Pull yourself together.

04:38.465 --> 04:39.865
I'm scared.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.466
Ain't nobody got time for that,
China doll.

04:41.468 --> 04:44.536
This shit got real real fast.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.104
And the only thing

04:46.106 --> 04:47.873
I need coming out of that
dick-licking mouth of yours

04:47.875 --> 04:49.941
is, "I don't know shit,"
and, "I didn't see shit."

04:49.943 --> 04:53.578
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes down.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.191
Do you understand? Do exactly...

04:57.184 --> 04:58.650
Do what I tell you to do.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.618
Aah!

05:33.620 --> 05:35.654
Choices, y'all.

05:35.656 --> 05:37.989
Life is all about 'em.

05:37.991 --> 05:41.093
One single decision can set
your life on a course

05:41.095 --> 05:43.528
that you may or may not enjoy too much.

05:43.530 --> 05:45.764
Rehab, foreclosures,

05:45.766 --> 05:47.899
one failed business after the next...

05:47.901 --> 05:50.769
It wasn't until I started
living intentionally

05:50.771 --> 05:52.904
that I was able to claim the inheritance

05:52.906 --> 05:57.142
that waits for every single one of us.

05:59.546 --> 06:01.613
That's when I created my award-winning

06:01.615 --> 06:05.550
abundance coaching program...
"Get It, Get It!"

06:05.552 --> 06:07.319
Now available as an e-book.

06:07.321 --> 06:10.355
Um, Jenn, you gonna hand out
those thumb drives?

06:10.357 --> 06:11.957
Yeah, baby.

06:11.959 --> 06:13.291
Okay, all right, all right.

06:13.293 --> 06:14.626
Where wa... Where was I?

06:14.628 --> 06:16.428
- Um...
- Life's wisdom?

06:17.264 --> 06:20.098
The life wisdom contained
on those thumb drives

06:20.100 --> 06:23.802
represents years of hard work
and hard lessons.

06:23.804 --> 06:26.438
My lifestyle-altering e-curriculum

06:26.440 --> 06:28.140
can teach everyone in this audience

06:28.142 --> 06:30.442
how to set a course for the kind of life

06:30.444 --> 06:32.944
you truly desire.

06:34.114 --> 06:36.214
Now, who here knows what intention is?

06:36.216 --> 06:37.215
Hmm?

Allergies.

Did you eat?

07:50.123 --> 07:51.189
Falafel, yeah.

07:51.191 --> 07:52.724
Where were you?

07:54.194 --> 07:55.927
I had to work late.

I'm not sure.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.941
Older, maybe? Wiser?

Okay. You know what?

Here. Put that away,

Might have.

12:41.690 --> 12:44.257
You know what?
‭I want to leave you my number.

12:44.259 --> 12:45.525
Yeah.

12:45.527 --> 12:49.662
Call me the second you see her, okay?

12:49.664 --> 12:53.533
It's important, maybe even
a matter of life or death.

12:53.535 --> 12:54.734
Who are you?

12:54.736 --> 12:55.869
I'm her boss.

12:57.539 --> 12:59.973
You dance with her at She She's?

12:59.975 --> 13:01.441
Yes, ma'am.

13:01.443 --> 13:04.911
I go by "Relevance."

13:05.914 --> 13:07.047
Okay, baby.

13:07.049 --> 13:08.915
Uh, feel better.

13:08.917 --> 13:11.651
Call me if you see Virginia.

13:15.590 --> 13:16.823
I don't know.

13:16.825 --> 13:18.925
She called this morning
and asked me to open.

13:18.927 --> 13:21.561
You see that burgundy minivan outside?

13:22.368 --> 13:23.329
It's been out there all morning.

13:23.331 --> 13:26.466
Whoever's in there is watching
the salon like a hawk.

13:29.538 --> 13:30.637
Where's she going?

13:38.480 --> 13:41.948
I brought you some croissants.

13:41.950 --> 13:44.884
I-I made them in my bread machine.

13:44.886 --> 13:46.686
They're a little smushed together,

13:46.688 --> 13:52.625
but they taste real good
and pull apart real easy.

14:02.405 --> 14:04.137
I'm going out of town for surgery.

14:04.139 --> 14:06.072
What kind?

14:08.810 --> 14:10.276
What, your tongue?

14:10.278 --> 14:13.213
Oh, my God.

14:13.215 --> 14:15.215
They can fix it, right?

14:18.937 --> 14:21.087
What's the name of the hospital?

14:21.089 --> 14:23.723
I'll send you some banana bread!

14:25.427 --> 14:27.494
Wait a minute. Back up the truck.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.596
You mean he died
right after the wedding?

14:29.598 --> 14:30.563
Before.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.566
She decided to marry him anyway.

14:33.568 --> 14:37.737
So, rather than be single,
your friend married a dead guy?

14:38.361 --> 14:40.140
Life is rough in these streets, y'all!

14:42.179 --> 14:43.439
I think she wanted to keep

14:43.464 --> 14:44.978
- the wedding gifts. ‭
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.080
That's a big thing in China, mind you.

14:47.082 --> 14:48.414
Oh, is your friend Chinese?

14:48.416 --> 14:50.183
- No, Methodist.
- ‭

14:50.185 --> 14:52.986
Hey, Cyn. Sorry I'm late.

14:52.988 --> 14:54.621
Looks like Jenn's got you covered.

14:54.623 --> 14:57.702
Her friend married
a dead guy in Hialeah.

14:58.011 --> 15:00.093
Sounds like Hialeah.

15:03.098 --> 15:06.399
Where are you?

15:06.401 --> 15:08.234
This is Virginia. Leave it at the beep.

15:25.687 --> 15:27.620
Shit.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.423
You okay, boo? You seem a little jumpy.

15:30.425 --> 15:34.661
Huh? No, I'm right as rain.

15:34.663 --> 15:37.591
Nail Artisans at Man...

15:37.593 --> 15:39.331
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey, Mandy.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.533
It's Mandy.

15:40.535 --> 15:43.136
Desna. ‭I got your deposit on Glint.

15:44.306 --> 15:46.139
Your application looks really good.

15:46.141 --> 15:48.308
That is fantastic. It's Mandy.

15:48.937 --> 15:50.643
You're close, just...

15:50.645 --> 15:53.213
I'm trying to say this
without saying it...

15:53.215 --> 15:55.048
be on your toes.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.684
Okay, exactly which toes would that be?

15:57.686 --> 15:59.319
On your best behavior, I mean.

15:59.321 --> 16:00.959
It's game time.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.457
What? You're sounding
very mysterious, Mandy.

16:04.459 --> 16:06.226
I know.

16:06.228 --> 16:08.328
Apologies for the intrigue.

16:08.330 --> 16:11.264
Just crush it if you want to get
that new salon.

16:11.266 --> 16:13.499
That's all I can say. Got to run.

16:13.501 --> 16:16.302
Right, but...

16:16.304 --> 16:17.670
What was that all about?

16:17.672 --> 16:18.738
I don't know.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.740
It sounds like Glint Nails is sending

16:20.742 --> 16:23.409
some sort of secret shopper over here.

16:23.411 --> 16:25.144
What, to see if we're up to snuff?

16:25.146 --> 16:26.613
We got this. ‭Yeah.

16:26.615 --> 16:27.413
We got this.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.851
We got this.

16:32.988 --> 16:35.588
Hey, Jenn, your hubby's outside.

16:44.766 --> 16:46.366
Oh, baby. ‭Babe?

16:46.368 --> 16:48.601
- Baby.
- ‭Baby, they can't find Roller.

16:48.603 --> 16:49.836
He's gone.

16:49.838 --> 16:52.005
- What do you mean "gone"?
- They can't find him.

16:52.007 --> 16:53.306
Oh, honey.

16:53.308 --> 16:54.841
- What's happening?
- Okay. It's o-okay.

16:54.843 --> 16:57.677
- They can't find Roller.
- What?

16:57.679 --> 16:59.012
- Shh. Take a breath.
- What happened?

16:59.014 --> 17:00.813
You take a breath.

17:00.815 --> 17:03.816
They... Des,
they found blood on the lanai.

17:03.818 --> 17:05.885
Who... Whose blood?

17:05.887 --> 17:07.420
- Roller's.
- ‭What?

17:07.422 --> 17:08.954
- Police called me. He's missing.
- It's okay. Hey.

17:08.957 --> 17:10.189
They're gonna see if the blood is his.

17:10.191 --> 17:12.325
His house is all shot up.
He's not answering his phone.

17:12.327 --> 17:13.992
Damn it.

17:13.994 --> 17:16.352
Well, what exactly happened?

17:16.897 --> 17:19.531
His neighbors...
His neighbors called 911.

17:19.534 --> 17:22.035
They heard gunshots and smelled fire,

17:22.037 --> 17:24.337
but they couldn't find a fire.

17:24.339 --> 17:26.806
It looks like someone was
dragged out to the dock.

17:26.808 --> 17:27.940
His boat's gone.

17:27.942 --> 17:30.243
Can't be good.

17:30.245 --> 17:31.778
‭Baby, we don't know anything.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.212
We don't know anything.

17:33.214 --> 17:36.482
I'm gonna go.

17:36.484 --> 17:38.651
I got to tell Uncle Daddy. I got to go.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.953
I'm gonna go.

17:44.087 --> 17:47.222
This is Virginia. Leave it at the beep.

17:48.213 --> 17:50.313
Hey, babe. Hey, babe.

17:50.315 --> 17:51.715
I can't.

17:51.717 --> 17:53.950
- I just can't.
- I know.

17:53.952 --> 17:56.386
- I'm so scared.
- Okay, all right. Okay.

17:56.388 --> 17:57.254
It's okay.

17:57.256 --> 17:59.356
I'm so scared.

17:59.358 --> 18:00.657
It's okay.

18:00.659 --> 18:02.425
You're safe. You're okay.

18:02.427 --> 18:03.960
We're gonna find him.

18:03.962 --> 18:06.652
I didn't even like that boy.

18:07.432 --> 18:08.665
Polly.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.835
The man lived hard,
worked hard, played hard.

18:11.837 --> 18:14.738
He does everything hard.

18:15.286 --> 18:16.706
Everything?

18:18.577 --> 18:20.544
Y'all know what? Unh-unh.

18:20.546 --> 18:22.679
Y'all are wrong for that.

18:22.681 --> 18:24.080
Shame on all of y'all.

18:24.082 --> 18:25.838
You know it's Polly.

18:26.485 --> 18:28.585
You call me if you need
anything at all. ‭Mm-hmm.

18:28.587 --> 18:29.884
All right, baby.

18:30.923 --> 18:32.422
We love you.

18:39.865 --> 18:42.098
Answer the phone, bitch.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.100
This is Virginia. Leave it at the beep.

18:49.141 --> 18:51.841
Thanks for dropping me
at my community service.

18:51.843 --> 18:55.312
You're so sweet to give me a lift.

18:55.314 --> 18:58.081
Des is messed up about Roller.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.584
I believe she truly cared for that boy.

19:00.586 --> 19:02.118
Even though she probably told herself

19:02.120 --> 19:04.143
it was just about the boning.

19:04.523 --> 19:05.488
In my experience,

19:05.490 --> 19:08.458
those lines get blurry, uh, fast.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.793
You tell yourself

19:09.795 --> 19:13.330
that you're just fulfilling
your deepest carnal appetites,

19:13.332 --> 19:16.466
that deep need we all, as humans, share

19:16.468 --> 19:20.704
for connection
‭and interpersonal friction.

19:20.706 --> 19:21.705
For pussy.

19:21.707 --> 19:22.839
Right.

19:22.841 --> 19:24.007
And you swear to yourself

19:24.009 --> 19:25.375
that your head's on straight

19:25.377 --> 19:27.611
and it's just gonna be
in and out, and then boom...

19:27.613 --> 19:30.747
you're knocked up by a minor Kennedy.

19:30.749 --> 19:32.482
Remember croissant lady?

19:33.552 --> 19:36.853
That freakazoid who was
waiting for you in the car?

19:37.889 --> 19:39.089
Life's too short.

19:39.091 --> 19:41.191
I say cut that off now.

19:41.193 --> 19:43.526
Girl, she had a twitchy look.

19:43.528 --> 19:45.362
Too thirsty.

19:47.232 --> 19:50.533
Well, aren't you the
Chattanooga Chatsworth today?

19:52.671 --> 19:53.937
Okay.

19:53.939 --> 19:55.505
I guess I better get to it.

19:56.408 --> 19:58.575
I'm gonna change some girls' lives.

20:08.253 --> 20:11.755
_

20:17.362 --> 20:21.264
Ladies, we will be
right with you all, okay?

20:21.266 --> 20:22.766
It's a little full in here today,

20:22.768 --> 20:26.036
but that's because
Nail Artisans at Manatee County

20:26.038 --> 20:27.704
is the place to be.

20:27.706 --> 20:30.206
- Oh, I like those leggings...
- Thank you.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.841
And those legs.

20:31.843 --> 20:34.717
Ann, give her an extra massage.

20:35.981 --> 20:37.080
- Jenn, this is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.

20:37.082 --> 20:38.448
You know what?

20:38.450 --> 20:40.931
Some crystals
will really bling that out.

20:45.791 --> 20:48.825
So, what were you in for?

20:48.827 --> 20:50.260
Madison, shut up.

20:50.262 --> 20:51.661
You know you're not supposed
to ask about that.

20:51.663 --> 20:54.564
That's okay, Madison.

20:54.566 --> 20:58.201
Only thing is I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

20:58.203 --> 21:00.470
It's one of the conditions
of my release.

21:01.707 --> 21:05.975
I-I wish I could tell you girls
what happened to me.

21:05.977 --> 21:07.711
It would be a relief, actually.

21:07.713 --> 21:09.379
Please.

21:11.283 --> 21:13.450
Close the door. Have a seat.

21:16.521 --> 21:20.290
I'm gonna need a guarantee
of confidentiality from y'all.

21:20.292 --> 21:22.058
- Okay.
- Yes.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.027
We won't say a word.

21:24.029 --> 21:25.768
Okay.

21:31.269 --> 21:34.985
I used to run a modeling agency
in Coral Gables.

21:35.474 --> 21:39.008
From the outside,
everything looked legit.

21:39.010 --> 21:44.380
I booked girls in campaigns
for J. Crew, Anthropologie.

21:44.382 --> 21:47.917
Mm-hmm. Dillard's.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.819
Dillard's sucks now.

21:49.821 --> 21:51.888
Dillard's sucked for years.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.623
Please, let her talk.

21:53.625 --> 21:57.293
But I'm afraid there was more
to the agency than met the eye.

21:57.295 --> 22:00.430
While I did book girls on big jobs,

22:00.432 --> 22:04.934
the whole thing was a front
for an upscale prostitution ring

22:04.936 --> 22:08.738
with clients from the highest
positions of government,

22:08.740 --> 22:10.980
as well as the entertainment industry.

22:11.519 --> 22:12.818
Like who?

22:13.821 --> 22:15.254
Eliot Spitzer.

22:16.991 --> 22:18.424
A-Rod.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.361
Charlie Sheen.

22:25.794 --> 22:27.399
Lamar Odom.

22:27.401 --> 22:28.400
Wait.

22:28.402 --> 22:30.603
Why would Lamar Odom pay for sex?

22:33.074 --> 22:36.775
Ah.

22:36.777 --> 22:38.591
That's easy, girls.

22:39.046 --> 22:41.468
You don't pay a whore to bang.

22:41.816 --> 22:43.929
You pay her to leave.

22:44.585 --> 22:45.985
Oh.

22:49.790 --> 22:52.491
- Oh, hey, Des.
- Hey, Pol.

22:52.493 --> 22:53.859
Listen.

22:53.861 --> 22:55.694
How soon can you get over to the shop?

22:55.696 --> 22:59.164
Oh, well, I just finished
my community service.

22:59.166 --> 23:00.766
Um, an hour, maybe?

23:00.768 --> 23:02.568
Mm, okay.

23:02.570 --> 23:05.704
I don't want to be understaffed
if our mystery shopper shows up.

23:05.706 --> 23:10.122
I would be there myself
if Dean wasn't so sick.

23:10.544 --> 23:13.812
Oh, okay. Well, I got you, sugar.

23:17.051 --> 23:18.684
I got to go.

23:25.726 --> 23:26.925
Hey!

23:26.927 --> 23:27.993
What the hell?

23:27.995 --> 23:29.962
Sorry, I...

23:31.932 --> 23:33.666
Really sorry about that.

23:33.668 --> 23:35.434
Jesus.

23:35.436 --> 23:37.736
Ohh!

23:37.738 --> 23:39.738
Damn it.

23:51.429 --> 23:54.697
I want to thank y'all
for coming, all right?

23:54.699 --> 23:56.366
There's strength in numbers.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.134
There's strength in numbers, right?

23:58.136 --> 23:59.769
We got numbers, and we're strong.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.437
- We'rehustlestrong.
- Right.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.842
But I couldn't do any of this
without my wife.

24:04.509 --> 24:05.908
My beautiful wife.

24:05.910 --> 24:07.744
Mm.

24:11.816 --> 24:13.216
Mm-hmm.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.351
All right, well

24:15.353 --> 24:17.487
I want to toast...
‭to toast to my wife, Juanda.

24:17.489 --> 24:18.821
Come on, now. Everybody up.

24:18.823 --> 24:20.089
- To Juanda.
- There you go.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.324
- To Juanda.
- To Juanda.

24:21.326 --> 24:22.925
- Juanda!
- To Juanda.

24:22.927 --> 24:24.494
What you want?

24:26.498 --> 24:28.598
Bring him in.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.434
All right, y'all,

24:31.436 --> 24:34.337
Chip Lauderdale here
from the Palmetto P.D.

24:35.457 --> 24:37.334
He gonna... gonna give us some news.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.008
Clay.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.309
Chip.

24:40.311 --> 24:41.911
What you got for us?

24:41.913 --> 24:44.647
Right here?

24:44.649 --> 24:47.386
Go ahead. We're all family here.
It's all right.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.264
We found him...

24:51.765 --> 24:53.156
Okay, let's go.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.227
...what was left of him...

24:56.628 --> 24:58.730
...at the end of the Manatee River

24:59.264 --> 25:00.997
on what was left of his boat.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.002
I'm so sorry, y'all.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.866
Fire must have got the most of him.

25:09.607 --> 25:11.285
Gators got the rest.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.876
Blood on the lanai
‭and on the lawn was a match,

25:13.878 --> 25:17.346
and, uh, we also found these, too.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.785
So sorry.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.965
I promised his daddy

25:25.657 --> 25:27.890
that I'd take care of him.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.462
Now they take my baby boy.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.866
They took my baby boy!

25:36.868 --> 25:37.800
Come here, baby.

25:37.802 --> 25:40.439
They took my baby boy! ‭Oh!

25:41.739 --> 25:43.005
Aah!

25:44.909 --> 25:46.709
- Oh!
- Ow!

25:48.513 --> 25:50.379
I'm sorry, baby. Baby, I'm sorry.

25:50.381 --> 25:53.116
They took my baby boy.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.283
They took my baby boy.

25:54.285 --> 25:56.052
Shh!

25:56.054 --> 26:00.356
- Oh, baby, it's okay.
- They took my baby boy!

26:00.358 --> 26:02.859
Hey, hey. Hey.

26:04.462 --> 26:06.829
He was my little brother.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.532
I was supposed to protect him.

26:09.691 --> 26:11.178
Baby, don't.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.936
I let him down...

26:13.938 --> 26:15.771
just like I let everybody down.

26:15.773 --> 26:18.407
Shh. It's okay.

26:24.883 --> 26:26.682
- Daddy, stop.
- Baby!

26:26.684 --> 26:27.783
- Aah!
- Daddy.

26:27.785 --> 26:29.418
Daddy, stop, stop. Please.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.400
Get away from me!

26:30.425 --> 26:31.687
Daddy, no, no, no! You're gonna hurt
yourself.

26:31.689 --> 26:33.322
Please, you're gonna hurt your hand.

26:33.324 --> 26:34.657
Daddy, no, no, no, no, no.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.692
- Aaaah!
- Stop!

26:36.694 --> 26:39.695
Please, please, please, please don't.

26:39.697 --> 26:41.564
Daddy, look at your hand.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.399
Shh.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.801
Oh, honey.

26:46.604 --> 26:48.971
He's got him.

26:50.642 --> 26:51.874
Dean, I'm home.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.009
Here.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.977
I-I kept something warm for you.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.386
Oh, thank you, sweetie,
but I ate already.

27:04.106 --> 27:06.389
Oh. Did you have dinner with Roller?

27:08.426 --> 27:09.611
Dean.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.447
- Dean.
- Yeah?

27:13.097 --> 27:15.097
Roller is missing.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.500
What, like at Costco?

27:17.502 --> 27:19.769
No, baby, not like at Costco.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.737
This is more serious.

27:21.739 --> 27:23.606
I-I would've talked to you
about it sooner,

27:23.608 --> 27:26.475
but, um, I-I just found out yesterday.

27:26.477 --> 27:28.144
Well, what... what happened to him?

27:28.146 --> 27:29.312
Well, we don't know.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.014
There was signs of a struggle
at his place, but...

27:32.016 --> 27:34.450
Dean, can you calm down for me?

27:34.452 --> 27:35.918
I loved him.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.987
He was gonna teach me to Jet Ski!

27:37.989 --> 27:39.755
I know, baby, but I can teach you.

27:39.757 --> 27:41.557
I don't want you to teach me!

27:41.559 --> 27:43.359
- Dean!
- I don't!

27:43.361 --> 27:44.727
Shit.

27:48.132 --> 27:49.432
Hey, Clay, I'm...

27:49.434 --> 27:51.100
Meet me at the salon.

27:52.270 --> 27:54.239
We need to talk.

28:06.451 --> 28:07.544
Hey.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.253
Clay, you okay?

28:12.523 --> 28:14.423
I need a new look.

28:14.425 --> 28:16.092
What?

28:18.596 --> 28:21.197
What did you do?

28:22.567 --> 28:24.770
Started punching my car.

28:26.473 --> 28:28.573
And I just couldn't stop.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.929
This...

28:33.978 --> 28:35.845
might...

28:35.847 --> 28:37.546
They found him...

28:38.816 --> 28:41.203
...what's left of him, at least...

28:41.986 --> 28:43.747
in a swamp...

28:45.089 --> 28:47.690
floating on a goddamn piece
of fiberglass

28:47.692 --> 28:48.858
from his boat.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.070
They gave me these.

29:07.478 --> 29:11.414
That's all that's left
of my big ol' baby boy.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.083
I'm sorry.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.891
You loved him, didn't you?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.758
When's the last time you saw him?

29:37.141 --> 29:41.596
Um, I guess it was the day, um, he...

29:43.915 --> 29:47.519
I-I threaded his eyebrows
earlier that day.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.487
That's something he needed done?

29:51.489 --> 29:53.535
We had a standing appointment.

29:53.537 --> 29:54.818
It's...

29:55.760 --> 29:59.428
You know Roller was vain.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.163
How was he that day?

30:01.165 --> 30:02.198
He was scared.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.499
I'm not gonna lie about that.

30:03.501 --> 30:06.769
He was scared and, um, jumpy,

30:06.771 --> 30:10.573
um, and I had never seen him like that.

30:10.575 --> 30:13.109
- That boy wasn't scared of nothing.
- ‭No, he was not.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.010
A-And that's why it was so strange.

30:15.012 --> 30:17.246
And I said, "What's wrong? Talk to me."

30:17.248 --> 30:20.282
But... he wasn't saying nothing.

30:25.307 --> 30:31.396
What about this, um this Virginia?

30:31.929 --> 30:37.433
I understand he had a little...
little thing with her.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.236
Well, ‭you know Roller had a thing

30:40.238 --> 30:41.270
with a lot of girls.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.872
Well, no doubt, but this Virginia,

30:42.874 --> 30:44.240
she gone missing, ain't she?

30:44.242 --> 30:45.241
It's kind of odd

30:45.243 --> 30:48.444
that she'd go M.I.A. all of a sudden,

30:48.446 --> 30:49.712
don't you think?

30:49.714 --> 30:52.548
Her mama is sick,

30:52.550 --> 30:53.916
really sick,

30:53.918 --> 30:55.751
and she went up to Okeechobee.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.019
Oh, yeah?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.465
Yeah.

31:03.661 --> 31:05.027
Well, you bring me that little trick

31:05.029 --> 31:07.196
the moment she returns... you hear me?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.199
Shit.

31:27.088 --> 31:28.921
Hello?

31:32.226 --> 31:33.726
Virginia?

31:35.463 --> 31:37.029
Shit.

31:39.067 --> 31:41.300
Virginia?

31:41.302 --> 31:43.803
We are in trouble now.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.986
Shit.

32:01.556 --> 32:03.422
- Bitch, what is you doing?
- You scared me.

32:03.424 --> 32:06.258
It's me, Virginia's boss, remember?

32:06.260 --> 32:08.728
- You didn't tear this place up?
- This shit ain't my doing.

32:08.730 --> 32:10.316
What kind of trouble is she in?

32:10.318 --> 32:12.440
I don't know. I wish I knew.

32:12.442 --> 32:13.866
She's not answering her cellphone,

32:13.868 --> 32:15.501
and I'm starting to get worried.

32:15.503 --> 32:17.637
I need you to think.

32:17.639 --> 32:19.472
Where could she be?

32:19.474 --> 32:22.642
Probably up the coast
at her happy place.

32:22.644 --> 32:25.344
We used to cam for these guys
up in Singapore

32:25.346 --> 32:27.136
at this dirty beach motel

32:27.138 --> 32:28.547
shooting Easter eggs
out our butts and stuff.

32:28.549 --> 32:30.650
Just... Just the name of it.

32:30.652 --> 32:31.851
The Sea Star?

32:31.853 --> 32:34.020
Come on. ‭S-Sea Maiden?

32:34.022 --> 32:35.054
I don't know.

32:35.056 --> 32:36.489
Got to deal with this shit.

32:36.491 --> 32:39.191
Damn it.

32:44.365 --> 32:46.332
Where are you, Virginia?

32:54.815 --> 32:56.208
Gotcha, bitch.

33:10.191 --> 33:11.424
I need to talk to you.

33:11.426 --> 33:12.625
Can it wait a minute?

33:12.627 --> 33:13.826
I'm just a little busy right now.

33:13.828 --> 33:15.061
No, frankly, it can't.

33:15.063 --> 33:19.098
I need, you know, some banking now.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.266
What are you...?

33:20.268 --> 33:22.034
What are you doing?

33:22.036 --> 33:25.204
Hey. This is not a good day
for you to make a scene in here.

33:25.206 --> 33:27.106
Who exactly is in charge
now that Roller is...

33:27.108 --> 33:28.774
I've been calling Desna all morning.

33:28.776 --> 33:30.876
It's not safe for me to have
that kind of cash in there,

33:30.878 --> 33:31.911
- not with...
- ‭Shh! ‭Shh!

33:31.913 --> 33:33.479
...not with my clientele.

33:33.481 --> 33:35.448
What the hell are you thinking,
carrying on like this?

33:35.450 --> 33:36.916
We're dying over there.

33:36.918 --> 33:38.250
In another day,
we'll be out of the product.

33:38.252 --> 33:40.052
Have you ever seen one of these mutants

33:40.054 --> 33:41.454
when you tell them that
they can't have their medicine?

33:41.456 --> 33:42.421
Shh!

33:42.423 --> 33:43.656
At least Roller handled

33:43.658 --> 33:45.091
all the pharmaceutical wholesalers.

33:45.093 --> 33:46.926
I mean, maybe he wasn't
so useless after all.

33:46.928 --> 33:50.896
Hey, easy, dude.
‭Roller's my brother-in-law.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.799
So here's my advice...
maybe don't talk that shit

33:53.801 --> 33:56.068
to my husband or father-in-law...

33:56.070 --> 33:59.305
that is, if you like having
your head attached to your body.

34:01.676 --> 34:03.609
So see you in 20, then?

34:07.248 --> 34:09.281
I'm sorry, honey.

34:09.283 --> 34:10.683
Oh, no.

34:10.685 --> 34:12.318
Pretty toasty in there. You know what?

34:12.320 --> 34:14.152
I'm just gonna take that off
and start right over.

34:14.155 --> 34:15.855
I have to run.

34:15.857 --> 34:17.422
Ick.

34:17.425 --> 34:21.193
I'm sorry. Um, well, obviously,
we won't charge you.

34:21.195 --> 34:21.994
I should hope not.

34:21.996 --> 34:23.728
Hey, could I settle up?

34:23.731 --> 34:25.264
- Just a second, honey.
- You know what?

34:25.266 --> 34:26.532
Because we feel so terrible,

34:26.534 --> 34:29.201
your next five manicures are on us.

34:29.203 --> 34:31.437
Honestly, if this is
the kind of work you do,

34:31.438 --> 34:34.139
I can't see coming back.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.940
Aw.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.943
I'm sorry. Thank you.

34:40.748 --> 34:43.349
Damn. It had to be her. Of course.

35:00.452 --> 35:02.134
How psycho you trying to be?

35:02.136 --> 35:03.402
Oh, shit.

35:03.404 --> 35:05.137
Don't run, bitch!

35:05.139 --> 35:06.505
Virginia!

35:06.507 --> 35:08.808
Come on, get back here!

35:08.810 --> 35:10.309
Girl, I...

35:12.480 --> 35:13.946
Aah!

35:13.948 --> 35:16.649
What the hell is wrong with you?!

35:16.651 --> 35:18.417
Get your ass up.

35:19.921 --> 35:21.787
How do I know Uncle Daddy
didn't send you?

35:21.789 --> 35:24.623
What happened to,
‭ "We supposed to be a... a team"?

35:24.625 --> 35:27.059
Huh? Just raggedy.

35:27.061 --> 35:29.628
Get your ass back in that room,

35:29.630 --> 35:32.598
and let's figure this mess out.

35:33.039 --> 35:35.935
Fine. Whatever.

35:47.481 --> 35:49.315
This is what you eat...

35:49.317 --> 35:51.884
candy and pork rinds?

35:51.886 --> 35:53.552
It's all they had in the machine.

35:53.554 --> 35:55.154
Ever heard of ordering a pizza?

35:55.156 --> 35:58.023
I don't eat pizza.
I don't eat hot foods.

36:02.864 --> 36:04.396
Why did you run off?

36:04.398 --> 36:05.764
Why did I run?

36:05.766 --> 36:08.500
You have every reason
to sell my ass out, Desna.

36:08.502 --> 36:10.469
Every fricking reason.

36:10.471 --> 36:12.604
I didn't know that I could
trust you and shit.

36:12.606 --> 36:14.106
I still don't know if I can.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.277
Did they find him?

36:18.279 --> 36:19.445
They did.

36:19.953 --> 36:21.947
What was left of him.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.549
Drifted all the way up the swamp.

36:23.551 --> 36:24.550
What about the other body?

36:24.552 --> 36:26.185
Who knows? Gators?

36:26.187 --> 36:29.088
- How'd they know it was Roller?
- ‭That damn grill.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.689
Good.

36:32.927 --> 36:34.760
That's how you feel about it?

36:34.762 --> 36:36.629
Yeah. ‭That's how I feel about it.

36:36.631 --> 36:39.584
Let me tell you how youneed
to feel about it.

36:40.801 --> 36:43.335
"Boo-hoo, I'm a grieving side piece.

36:43.337 --> 36:45.337
Look at how torn up I am."

36:45.339 --> 36:46.839
I need you to come back to Palmetto

36:46.841 --> 36:48.340
and come back to the salon.

36:48.342 --> 36:50.175
- You think you can handle that?
- Sure, whatever.

36:50.177 --> 36:52.278
Come to the funeral, pay your respects.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.947
And then, if anybody ask you
where you been,

36:54.949 --> 36:56.248
say you was with your mama,

36:56.250 --> 36:58.951
'cause that's what I told Uncle Daddy.

36:58.953 --> 37:00.753
With my mom?

37:00.755 --> 37:03.856
My mom is dead, Desna.

37:03.858 --> 37:05.457
Thanks a lot.

37:06.124 --> 37:08.093
Shit.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.995
We'll cross that bridge.

37:09.997 --> 37:12.231
Listen, this... this is all about

37:12.233 --> 37:13.732
how well you play your part.

37:13.734 --> 37:16.201
And trust and believe,
I need you to play it well.

37:16.203 --> 37:18.158
I'm not gonna have you
endangering my life.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.639
Endangering your life?

37:20.641 --> 37:22.675
Because I saved your life, Desna.

37:22.677 --> 37:25.544
I didn't ask you to save my li...

37:25.546 --> 37:27.212
I didn't ask you for shit.

37:27.214 --> 37:28.781
And now I'm running all over creation

37:28.783 --> 37:29.915
on account of what you did.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.451
Because I did what you couldn't do!

37:32.453 --> 37:34.486
I took care of it.

37:36.557 --> 37:38.190
From here on out,

37:38.192 --> 37:41.826
you gonna do
‭exactly what I tell you to do.

37:43.731 --> 37:46.432
Do you understand me?

37:46.434 --> 37:47.833
Yes.

37:58.259 --> 37:59.611
Will you stay?

38:00.261 --> 38:01.480
What?

38:01.482 --> 38:02.481
Please.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.417
Just till I fall asleep.

38:21.969 --> 38:25.337
You lied to me!

38:25.339 --> 38:27.239
Tongue surgery?

38:27.241 --> 38:30.476
That is a bunch of shit,
and you know it!

38:30.478 --> 38:32.644
Get it, Ann! Yeah, girl!

38:32.646 --> 38:34.113
You just got sick of my pussy!

38:34.115 --> 38:35.881
Admit it! Is that it?

38:35.883 --> 38:37.282
Do whatever you got to do

38:37.284 --> 38:39.118
to get this crazy bitch out of here now.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.453
Show's over, people. Move along.

38:41.455 --> 38:44.456
- Nothing to see.
- You heard her, go on.

38:49.964 --> 38:52.131
That's America right there!

38:52.133 --> 38:53.899
That is America.

38:53.901 --> 38:55.768
Yeah!

38:55.770 --> 38:57.302
I do love a love story.

38:57.304 --> 38:59.638
Okay. Show's over.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.941
Go home.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.377
It's Bryce. Hey, baby, you okay?

39:06.347 --> 39:08.347
Can you meet me at She She's?

39:08.349 --> 39:10.282
I think they found out something
about Roller.

39:10.284 --> 39:14.064
Bryce... I need to talk to you.

39:14.066 --> 39:15.022
Okay.

39:15.024 --> 39:16.889
- Let's talk right here.
- Okay.

39:19.827 --> 39:21.193
All right.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.886
I got a proposition for you.

39:25.430 --> 39:29.034
Now, I don't know what kind of coin

39:29.036 --> 39:30.936
you pulling down as a life coach.

39:30.938 --> 39:32.071
- Abundance coach.
- Abundance coach.

39:32.073 --> 39:34.840
- Yeah. Abundance.
- Abundance. Yeah.

39:34.842 --> 39:37.191
I want you to run the clinic.

39:38.145 --> 39:40.746
Take over for Roller,
earn Roller's salary.

39:44.073 --> 39:46.151
No. I don't believe so.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.453
Bryce, honey,
let's just nip this in the bud.

39:47.455 --> 39:48.921
Sweetie, let's just hear...
hear him out.

39:48.923 --> 39:49.922
He... ‭Honey.

39:49.924 --> 39:51.256
Let me tell you something.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.425
♪ On the, on the phone

39:53.916 --> 39:56.128
I been running games
since I was a teenage boy,

39:56.130 --> 39:59.298
and I never, ever, ever

39:59.714 --> 40:01.333
seen something as good as this clinic.

40:01.841 --> 40:04.303
Now, the Haitians, they got their lane.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.345
Russians, they got theirs.

40:07.221 --> 40:08.674
This is ours.

40:10.433 --> 40:13.212
I see us opening these puppies
across the state.

40:13.214 --> 40:14.613
And the best part...

40:16.183 --> 40:17.516
You know the best part?

40:19.053 --> 40:21.153
It's all legal.

40:23.591 --> 40:24.957
If we're careful.

40:33.067 --> 40:34.566
I-I don't know, Uncle Daddy.

40:34.568 --> 40:36.869
Bryce, honey, this is where
you say, "No, thank you."

40:36.871 --> 40:39.504
Let the man consider it!

40:42.576 --> 40:44.576
I need you, son.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.046
It is all hands on deck.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.581
After what happened to Roller,
I need you, son.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.250
Okay, that's not gonna be necessary.

40:51.252 --> 40:55.811
Bryce, honey, do you ever
want to get laid again?

40:59.193 --> 41:01.460
Come on, baby.

41:07.045 --> 41:09.779
Goddamn pussy whip.

41:17.406 --> 41:19.306
Wow.

41:19.308 --> 41:21.274
Don't you look nice.

41:21.276 --> 41:22.709
Thanks.

41:22.711 --> 41:25.178
Here, let me... let me help you here.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.479
All right?

41:26.481 --> 41:30.554
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
about earlier this week.

41:30.786 --> 41:34.020
I didn't know how much
Roller meant to you.

41:34.022 --> 41:35.889
Yeah, I loved him.

41:35.891 --> 41:37.457
He's the kind of man I want to be.

41:37.459 --> 41:40.827
W-Well, no, you're already
a good man, Dean.

41:40.829 --> 41:42.028
No, I'm not.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.530
I-I'm gonna be, though.

41:43.532 --> 41:44.898
I'm changing.

41:44.900 --> 41:45.899
Changing how?

41:45.901 --> 41:47.400
Grown man changes.

41:47.402 --> 41:49.469
You need someone to look after
you now that Roller's gone.

41:49.471 --> 41:50.917
I'm okay, Dean.

41:50.919 --> 41:51.905
Yeah.

41:56.378 --> 41:58.778
Hey, Mandy.

41:58.780 --> 42:01.314
What happened to "be on your toes"?

42:01.316 --> 42:02.949
The owner of your dream salon

42:02.951 --> 42:05.652
sent in a spy to check out your zhuzh.

42:05.654 --> 42:07.254
She said that she was ignored,

42:07.256 --> 42:09.656
left with wet nails, the whole nine.

42:09.658 --> 42:12.692
Damn it. M-Mandy, I am so sorry.

42:12.694 --> 42:14.194
T-That's not the way I run a business.

42:14.196 --> 42:17.163
Listen, tell her
I will make it up to her.

42:17.165 --> 42:19.199
It's just been a horrific week.

42:19.201 --> 42:21.735
I mean, we're... we're about
to go to a funeral right now.

42:21.737 --> 42:24.170
Well, I hate to have to say this today,

42:24.172 --> 42:27.908
but Glint Nails is off the menu.

42:27.910 --> 42:31.244
Wait, what? H-Hello?

42:31.246 --> 42:32.946
He...

42:41.456 --> 42:44.257
Dean, we're leaving in 15 minutes.

42:44.259 --> 42:46.593
Yeah. But I-I didn't have breakfast yet.

42:46.595 --> 42:48.340
15 minutes.

43:05.447 --> 43:08.319
Now, don't put too much on
now, there, dear.

43:09.117 --> 43:11.697
When have I done you wrong?

43:15.324 --> 43:17.490
True enough.

43:20.362 --> 43:21.861
Still funerary?

43:21.863 --> 43:23.918
Mm-hmm.

43:24.633 --> 43:27.067
Still funerary, dear.

43:40.482 --> 43:41.881
Thank you, baby.

43:41.883 --> 43:43.612
Mm-hmm.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.807
But let us not succumb to grief.

44:40.809 --> 44:45.011
Let us stay hungry for life
and all its blessings.

44:45.013 --> 44:48.581
I read now a, uh,
selection from "Total Recall,"

44:48.583 --> 44:51.384
the autobiography
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

44:51.797 --> 44:55.789
a hero of... of Roller's.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.891
"Be hungry for success,

44:57.893 --> 44:59.201
hungry to make your mark,

44:59.202 --> 45:00.223
_

45:00.248 --> 45:02.595
hungry to be seen and to be heard

45:02.597 --> 45:04.330
and to have an effect.

45:04.332 --> 45:06.833
And as you move up
and become successful,

45:06.835 --> 45:10.637
make sure also to be hungry
for helping others."

45:10.639 --> 45:12.205
I'm hungry. ‭Sit down.

45:12.207 --> 45:13.540
- I've been hungry for a long time.
- ‭No, no no, no.

45:13.542 --> 45:14.874
Dean, sit down.

45:14.876 --> 45:16.409
Sit down. ‭I'm...

45:17.412 --> 45:20.780
Lord Jesus Christ, by your own
three days in the tomb,

45:20.782 --> 45:23.787
you hallowed the graves
of all who believe in you,

45:24.319 --> 45:26.519
and so made the grave a sign of hope

45:26.521 --> 45:28.621
that promises resurrection,

45:28.623 --> 45:31.624
even as it claims our mortal bodies.

45:33.462 --> 45:35.595
Then he will see you face to face,

45:35.597 --> 45:39.632
and in your light will see light
and know the splendor of God,

45:39.634 --> 45:42.969
for you live and reign forever and ever.

45:42.971 --> 45:43.870
Amen.

46:17.873 --> 46:19.873
Some funeral.

46:19.875 --> 46:22.475
I'm so sorry for your loss.

46:22.477 --> 46:24.077
God bless you.

46:24.079 --> 46:27.814
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

46:27.816 --> 46:31.784
I'm so sorry your honey's gone.

46:31.786 --> 46:35.522
I can't imagine
‭what you're going through.

46:36.525 --> 46:38.658
I know you cared deeply for him.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.959
Mm-hmm.

46:41.730 --> 46:44.130
- What the hell?
- They think you're the widow.

46:44.132 --> 46:47.200
How do all these weirdos
know my business?

46:47.202 --> 46:49.969
I don't know, but they know who you are.

46:49.971 --> 46:51.437
