00:06.640 --> 00:08.676
Oh, hello, Dr. Glassman.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.211
If you're here to
talk about our argument...

00:10.344 --> 00:12.012
I am, kind of, in a way.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.283
Working under Salen

00:15.416 --> 00:18.452
was making me
into a bad doctor,
so I quit.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.921
I'm creating a spreadsheet
of residency programs.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.157
I have 12 metrics.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.625
Well, Shaun,
that's a problem,

00:24.758 --> 00:27.628
because there aren't
a lot of programs around

00:27.761 --> 00:29.663
that are gonna
take a resident
at your level.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.433
And also...

00:32.566 --> 00:34.968
You're somewhat vulnerable
because of the ASD.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.439
I've already quit.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.174
We got a plan, Shaunie.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.843
We are talking to
an investigative reporter

00:42.976 --> 00:46.514
for a story on the damage that
Salen has done to St. Bon's.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.416
It'll put pressure
on the Pension Fund

00:48.549 --> 00:50.484
that's financing
the hospital takeover.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.187
The deal doesn't close
for eight days.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.488
We still have time
to stop it.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.992
We think you should
apologize to Salen

00:59.127 --> 01:01.495
and ask for
your job back.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.166
Apologize.
Save your career.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.636
She will not say yes.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.304
Oh, she will say yes.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.005
You're on the poster.
What's she gonna do,

01:12.140 --> 01:14.041
drag you out of the hospital
kicking and screaming?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.709
It'd be a PR disaster.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.146
I have nothing
to apologize for.
She does.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.515
We agree, but if
we pull this off,
it is only for eight days.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.685
But what if you don't?

01:24.818 --> 01:27.888

01:28.021 --> 01:29.357
If we don't,
then we rethink.

01:33.661 --> 01:37.298
I will focus
on the medicine.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.139
We've got a morale problem
at the hospital.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.875
Maybe it's just
aftershocks from what
happened with the baby,

01:48.008 --> 01:49.410
but I'm hearing
a lot of complaints.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.978
Even the board's unhappy.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.282
Which is why I plan to
replace them as soon
as the deal closes.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.917
Well, good doctors
are a lot harder to replace
than board members.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.254
Any employees we lose,
we'll find others
better aligned with Ethicure.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.556
We've got a lot
of great people
at St. Bon's,

02:02.690 --> 02:03.957
and I'd like to
make an effort
to keep them.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.460
How's your morale?

02:08.028 --> 02:09.363
I'm fine.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.232
I know yesterday
was tough,

02:11.365 --> 02:12.733

02:14.001 --> 02:15.769
I hope you aren't
doubting yourself.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.571
Shaun warned me.
I didn't listen.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.940
You took a risk,

02:20.073 --> 02:21.909
and your patient
is better off for that.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.379
And now you and I
are gonna make this

02:25.513 --> 02:28.015

in the Bay Area.

No. I feel fine now.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.392
SHAUN: Blurry vision?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.228
Dr. Murphy,
why are you here?

02:40.361 --> 02:42.630
I'm focusing
on the medicine.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.498
I don't have any
patients of my own.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.799
Probably because
you quit yesterday.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.235
Have you spoken to Salen?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.870
This says
you lost consciousness
while running

02:50.003 --> 02:50.938
and hit your head.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.740
Uh, yep.

And no.
No blurry vision.

three days post-flight,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.782

are only slightly elevated

03:01.915 --> 03:03.551
despite receiving
a donor liver
six months back.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.185
It doesn't seem
transplant-related.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.120
Well, it was a very
high-quality liver.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.622
From an even
higher-quality person.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.325

Total hero.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.636
Definitely is.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.638
We'll schedule a head CT

03:24.772 --> 03:25.973
to look for damage
from your fall,

03:26.106 --> 03:27.808
as well as any reason
why you fainted.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.777
Great. I'm sure
it'll be fine.
Yeah.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.345
If not, good news.

I've backed you at every step

11:14.441 --> 11:16.977
because I believe
a great hospital
could be profitable, too.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.746
But blackmail
is unacceptable.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.317
Think big picture.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.020
We just lost the president
of the hospital.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.222
You're running this place.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.724
Short-term.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.325
The future is wide open.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.362
For both of us.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.331
****

11:40.267 --> 11:41.434
Where's Dr. Lim?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.204
She's no longer available.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.139
But I'm
the Chief of Surgery

11:46.273 --> 11:48.475
and will be personally
involved in your case.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.344
Unfortunately,
your imaging is consistent

11:51.478 --> 11:53.146
with a bladder sarcoma
abutting your uterus.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.149
Cancer?

11:57.084 --> 11:59.686
But we did surrogacy testing.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.522
It's small right now,
but it will continue to grow
as the fetus does.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.024
Oh, God.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.859
And what can we do?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.928
The safest option

12:08.061 --> 12:10.030
is to terminate the pregnancy,
resect the tumor,

12:10.163 --> 12:11.164
and begin chemotherapy.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.235
Are there
any other options?

12:19.306 --> 12:22.209
There are a number
of chemotherapy protocols

12:22.342 --> 12:24.377
that are safe for
second trimester fetuses.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.079
But they'll all be
far less effective

12:26.213 --> 12:28.515
against the cancer
than surgery.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.383
****

12:32.886 --> 12:33.854
I want to do the chemo.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.655
Grace...

12:37.657 --> 12:38.691
Are you sure?

12:38.826 --> 12:39.893
Yes.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.968
So...
I heard.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.736
You're lucky
to still have a job.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.205
Well, I'm not sure
if it's luck or you.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.574
Salen suggested I learn
to play the game like you do.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.642
She's right.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.412
I didn't realize
being a doctor was a game.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.215
Why are you obsessing
about this?

13:04.918 --> 13:05.718
We have a meeting.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.423
I'm sure all of you
have feelings

13:10.557 --> 13:12.559
about what happened
with our colleagues.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.861
Shaun,
if you want to talk...

13:13.994 --> 13:15.395
Ryan has encephalitis.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.134
Lea is okay.
I'm focusing on the medicine.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.138
You said
his head CT was clean.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.240
Our scan was interrupted
by his seizure.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.376
I went back
and reviewed the images.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.944
There appears
to be hypodensity

13:31.078 --> 13:32.612
in the bilateral medial
temporal lobes.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.348
Interesting.
Suggests HSV.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.617
That's just artifact
from skull base.
It's not encephalitis.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.255
Clean CT plus clean blood test
suggests a cardiac problem.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.792
I'm with Dr. Park.
Place Ryan
on telemetry and...

13:45.926 --> 13:47.060
You should trust me.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.264
I told you not to
do that surgery yesterday.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.600
I was right then,
and I am right now.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.469
****

14:02.142 --> 14:04.878
No reason not to rule out
encephalitis, as well.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.280
Start him on acyclovir
in addition to
the cardiac monitor.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.282
****

14:13.921 --> 14:15.288
We could try Ifosfamide.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.290
Lim and the others
are speaking out

14:17.424 --> 14:19.526
at the annual
Pension Fund meeting
the day after tomorrow.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.895
Please help me find
a chemo regimen for Grace.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.663
Okay, Ifosfamide
can cause pre-term labor.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.367
I'm gonna
go with Adriamycin.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.468
I'm gonna
speak out with them.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.004
That's gonna blow up
your whole career.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.505
Blow up your whole life.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.308
Wouldn't be the first time.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.279
Come with us.
You're great at sales.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.215
Help us persuade
the Pension Fund.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.883
Sometimes you got to stand up
for what's right.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.687
What I do or do not
stand up for

14:47.820 --> 14:50.057
is my choice,

14:50.190 --> 14:53.326
and my friends
should respect that.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.328
****

14:57.430 --> 14:58.565
What have you
come up with?

14:59.967 --> 15:02.369
There are
a few options...
(CELL PHONES CHIMING)

15:03.670 --> 15:04.837
Grace is crashing.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.507
****

15:10.777 --> 15:12.679
I'm going to test you
for encephalitis

15:12.812 --> 15:15.348
and place you on telemetry
to check for heart problems.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.416
Okay.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.753
Is your neck
bothering you?

15:20.887 --> 15:23.356
Y-Yeah. It just started
feeling a little weird.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.525
Okay, can you take your gown
off your shoulders, please?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.430
****

15:34.667 --> 15:35.668
W-What is that?

15:36.869 --> 15:39.372
Not encephalitis
or a heart problem.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.376
****

15:47.014 --> 15:48.948
You had a uterine
vessel rupture.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.584
We were able to treat it,

15:51.718 --> 15:54.087
but your cancer's progressing
quicker than we thought.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.957
Our recommendation
is to terminate.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.394
We'll remove the tumor
and reconstruct your bladder.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.798
But you said

16:05.932 --> 16:09.669
there was a chemotherapy
that was safe for the baby.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.605
The rupture made
everything more serious.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.274
You need surgery now,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.409
or the cancer
might kill you.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.549
If you don't want
to terminate,

16:22.682 --> 16:25.918
there is an experimental
cystoscopic surgery.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.655
It should be able to clear
almost all of the cancer.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.426
W-What...
What are the risks
to the baby?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.130
30% chance of miscarriage.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.699
****

16:40.500 --> 16:41.601
Gracie.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.104
Gracie.

16:46.873 --> 16:47.907
It's okay.

16:49.942 --> 16:50.943
You should terminate.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.647
You should do the surgery

16:54.781 --> 16:56.816
that gets rid of
all of the cancer.

16:58.351 --> 17:02.021
****

17:10.097 --> 17:11.464
I'd like to do the chemo.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.342
You realize you probably
won't survive.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.477
****

17:27.680 --> 17:30.250
As long as the baby
reaches viability.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.520
Gracie, honey, you don't
have to do this for me.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.159
I'm not.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.495
****

17:59.646 --> 18:01.548
I went through
some of your recent cases.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.417
W-Why?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.085
Because of what Salen said.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.088
You know she likes me.
What's the problem
with her liking me?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.823
Because of your
paranoid reaction.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.626
I reacted because
it seemed like

18:13.760 --> 18:15.228
you were reading something
into her comment.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.464
Like you didn't trust me.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.031
And now you're
going through my files?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.033
Apparently,
I'm not paranoid.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.371
Nira Joseph.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.542
I didn't realize
"playing the game"

18:29.676 --> 18:31.711
is shorthand for losing
your entire moral compass.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.781
Nira is half-blind
because of you.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.949
****

18:37.083 --> 18:38.385
She had a tumor...

18:38.518 --> 18:39.919
There is no mention
in her file

18:40.052 --> 18:42.789
of the procedure
that could have
saved her sight.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.325
A procedure you thought
wasn't a viable idea.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.926
I didn't tell you
to hide it.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.262
You can't offer every patient
every experimental surgery...

18:49.396 --> 18:52.399
Ah, especially not
when "we're" trying
to win control of the clinic.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.103
It was the right choice
medically.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.972
It was her choice.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.074

(DOOR CLOSES)

19:10.283 --> 19:14.487
****

19:14.621 --> 19:16.756
Ryan's rash
plus seizure and fainting

19:16.889 --> 19:18.591
suggests an
autoimmune disorder.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.360
Makes sense.
His ESR's elevated.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.795
ESR's a nonspecific
inflammatory marker.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.597
Wouldn't matter
if it was through the roof.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.901
Dr. Park,
are you taking offense
at the diagnosis?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.104
Salen fired our friends.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.377
I didn't know about
that in advance,
didn't support it.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.945
And do you
support it now?

19:39.078 --> 19:40.980
It doesn't matter
what he supports.
He's not the CEO.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.482
No, he's just her bagman.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.388
Salen came into this hospital
because it was going bankrupt.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.558
And now it's become
Salen's ATM machine.
That's an improvement?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.192
You have been against her
from the moment she came in.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.827
Just proven right.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.996
You're not facing reality.
The takeover's happening.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.831
Someone's got to keep
the hospital running.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.834
You think
you're being realistic?
You're being complicit.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.637
We should start Ryan
on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune...

20:04.771 --> 20:06.205
Don't you see how
being her apologists
is corrupting you?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.640
Dr. Park...

20:07.774 --> 20:09.542
You took a woman's
vision away

20:09.676 --> 20:10.643
to get your hands
on the clinic.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.045
Not fair.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.782
And you stand by her
after she kills a child.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.018
Dr. Park, do you have
an alternative diagnosis?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.022
No.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.158
Start Ryan
on corticosteroids.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.894
****

20:30.997 --> 20:31.964
I'm done.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.667
****

20:35.968 --> 20:37.870
I'll finish up
with my patients

20:38.004 --> 20:39.872
and then submit
my resignation.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.417
LEA: If I get
a job downtown,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.852
this would be a good place
to meet for lunch.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.254
They have great
French pancakes.
Kind of eggy, but...

20:55.388 --> 20:56.323
I should join you.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.428
Lea, I'm the poster boy.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.631
It made Salen take me back.
It could make the difference.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.265
It'll make a difference,
sure, but...

21:06.399 --> 21:07.634
That's good enough.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.736
You are so close to
finishing your residency.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.738
One more year,
and you can go
wherever you want.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.008
Dr. Glassman,

21:16.142 --> 21:17.844
Park,

21:17.977 --> 21:21.481
Lim, they've stood up
for me so many times.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.954
You've stood up for me
so many times.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.893
Now I want to stand up
for all of you.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.963

21:38.598 --> 21:39.932
Okay.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.570
(SIGHS)

21:54.414 --> 22:00.152
Okay, can you make fun
of my beard or my eye bags
or anything? I hate this.

22:00.286 --> 22:04.591
How many times did I say
I didn't want to get involved
in the Salen stuff?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.125
But you still
kept pushing.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.161
I wanted you on my side.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.130
You act like
I'm scared of a fight.

22:14.266 --> 22:18.938
I'm a Black woman
in one of the top surgical
residencies in the country.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.608
Do you know how hard
I had to fight to be here?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.210
I don't have
the same luxury as you do.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.479
I'm not scared.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.780
I'm exhausted.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.984
****

22:32.118 --> 22:33.686
I never thought of it
that way.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.724
(SIGHS)

22:37.857 --> 22:38.791
I'm sorry.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.797
Thank you.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.800
****

22:52.104 --> 22:55.007
And I think I know
who Grace is fighting for.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.345
She said she didn't have
any children of her own.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.181
****

23:02.314 --> 23:05.618
But you had to have
given birth before you
became a surrogate.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.235
We know what happened
to Willem.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.842
It wasn't your fault.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.847
What kind of a mother
loses track of her baby
at a playground?

23:36.449 --> 23:37.850
A 19-year-old.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.753
Who's overwhelmed.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.623
I wasn't overwhelmed.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.028
(SIGHS) I wasn't
paying attention.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.871
I was arguing on the phone
with my boyfriend.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.676
And I turned...
I turned my back.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.217
(CRYING)
The crash was so loud.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.053
****

24:17.256 --> 24:18.457
So now,

24:19.826 --> 24:23.896
I give babies to people
who actually deserve them.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.502
Killing yourself

24:29.636 --> 24:31.504
won't bring Willem back.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.743

not just in the children
you carry.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.522
I lost myself

This isn't just
about you.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.511
It's also about Amanda,

25:12.645 --> 25:14.814
your friend, who loves you.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.450
I'm trying to help her...

25:18.585 --> 25:20.653
No. You're not
listening to her.

25:20.787 --> 25:24.323
She does not want the price
of her child to be your life.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.529
You don't
have to terminate.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.734
Just let us do
the cystoscopic surgery.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.805
It could let
Amanda have her baby...

are jaundiced.

27:01.253 --> 27:04.223
Which means it is your liver.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.461

I lose things.

Your symptoms were from

The tumor put
your immune system

unrelated organs.

Yes. There was probably
a microscopic lesion
in the lobe you donated.

who I am when I'm with you.

40:27.793 --> 40:31.897
** The Devil's
in the basement
in my home

40:33.765 --> 40:37.536
** A flight of stairs
is way too close

40:39.538 --> 40:43.374
** He comes for me
when I'm alone

40:45.343 --> 40:48.880
** Collecting debts
that I don't owe

40:51.917 --> 40:58.289
** Am I looking for revival?

40:58.423 --> 41:01.893
** Am I dressed in other's sin?

41:05.230 --> 41:11.903
** Hold my breath
until I'm honest

41:12.037 --> 41:15.974
** Will I ever breathe again?

41:19.244 --> 41:23.915
** When the world's so heavy
I can't stand

41:25.250 --> 41:28.754
** I close my eyes
and start again

41:31.122 --> 41:35.126
** Though my heart
is in my hands

41:37.228 --> 41:40.932
** I won't break
Give me faith to bend

41:43.569 --> 41:50.108
** Am I looking for revival?

41:50.241 --> 41:53.411
** Am I dressed in other's sin?

41:56.815 --> 42:03.589
** Am I looking for revival?

42:03.722 --> 42:06.958
** Am I dressed in other's sin?

42:10.095 --> 42:16.735
** Hold my breath
until I'm honest

42:16.868 --> 42:23.474
** Will I ever breathe again?

42:23.609 --> 42:27.278
** Will I ever breathe again? **
