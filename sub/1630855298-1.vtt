00:07.048 --> 00:09.342
- So how'd it go?

00:09.384 --> 00:10.719
- He was actually
kind of nice.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.887
- See, I told you
it would go well.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.681
- Second date Friday!

00:14.723 --> 00:18.018
- Ah, that's why you're
working out at 11:00 at night.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.602
- Um, okay, talk tomorrow.

00:19.644 --> 00:20.854
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.440
- Bye.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.317
Okay.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.111
- What's up? What's up, guys?

00:28.153 --> 00:29.696
Welcome back
to Exoglass Studios.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.822
It's your girl, Roxie,
and I'm here

00:30.864 --> 00:32.532
with your 30-minute
hip workout.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.867
But that's enough talking.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.535
Let's get right into it
with some jumping jacks.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.871
Here we go. And one, two.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.873
Get those arms
all the way up overhead.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.374
[muffled thudding]

00:41.416 --> 00:44.377
You got this.
We're just getting started.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.629
And three.
Right into butt kicks.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.131
Two. Last one.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.799
Butt kick.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.344
I'm bringing my heels
all the way to my booty.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.305
[tense music]

00:55.347 --> 01:02.479
* *

01:21.498 --> 01:23.041
You're doing great.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.418
Go ahead
and add in those arms.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.754
Good. Squat nice and low.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.257
Kill those squats.
Hold it here and pulse.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.927
Four, three,
we're going into fasties,

01:33.968 --> 01:35.929
two, almost there.

01:39.015 --> 01:45.814

01:51.403 --> 01:55.573
Four, three, two, one more,
and release.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.868
Come on, I know it's hurting,
but it hurts so good.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.371
Whew, you are gonna feel that
in the morning.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.248
And we're not done yet.
Now, let's run it out.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.208
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

[tennis ball thumping]

02:11.798 --> 02:13.800
[crowd cheering]

02:13.842 --> 02:15.969
- And Nathan Bartlett
steps up to serve.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.847
It's match point for
the biggest win of his career.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.267
Let's see if he's got
the eye of the tiger.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.643
Forehand down the line.
Winner!

02:23.685 --> 02:25.270
Nathan Bartlett takes out

02:25.311 --> 02:27.272
world number one
Roger Federer 6-4, 6-2.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.857
- Little slow there, Roger.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.942
- What a gutsy,
never-say-die win.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.821
Could Bartlett be
America's next top ten player?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.698
- Based on the patterns
we discovered,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.700
we fear the Westside Ripper
will strike again soon.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.327
- Do we have to wake up
to murder every morning?

02:41.369 --> 02:42.996
- They're talking about
that serial killer

02:43.038 --> 02:44.330
that's basically
in our back yard.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.790
It is so exciting.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.751
- Shouldn't we be playing
"Baby Mozart" or something?

02:47.792 --> 02:48.918
[timer chimes]

02:48.960 --> 02:51.463
- The signs are up.
The flyers are out.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.715
I'm baking cookies
like a fucking Keebler elf.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.842
This house is gonna move fast.
- It better.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.344
The sellers
are losing their patience.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.887
- All right, I got this, Paul.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.056
- Ow, shit, that's hot.
- Obviously.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.183
I just took them out.
Are those are my pants?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.976
- Well, it's not like you're
gonna be wearing them anymore.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.228
- Ugh.
- Love you.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.438
Morning.
- Morning.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.190
- The cookies are awesome.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.733
- I used to have
an ass like that.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.568
- You still have
an ass like that.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.944
- And my sister is having
so much more sex

03:14.986 --> 03:16.154
than I ever did.
- Really?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.364
- Yeah.
- Speak for yourself.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.824
- Oh, excuse me?
- I did really good.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.201
- Don't forget the pizza.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.996
[soft dramatic music]

03:25.038 --> 03:27.540
- I found both victims
lying beside each other.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
The killer
had dismembered the bodies.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.837
- Detective Hardwick of
the Chicago Homicide Division

03:32.879 --> 03:35.090
was the first to arrive
at the horrific scene.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.384
- He cut off the arms,
the hands, the legs,

03:37.425 --> 03:40.428
the heads, everything.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.222
Then he put the bodies
back together,

03:42.263 --> 03:44.599
except for one small detail.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.393
He swapped the heads.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.231
- Hey, excuse me.
- Hi.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.441
- Has the open house
started yet?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.527
- Uh, uh, yeah,
yeah, of course.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.904
I'm Ava.
You can go and head in.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.155
I'll be right behind you.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.281
- Cool.
- Yeah.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.701
- Yeah.
- Okay. Wow.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.204
Edgeless pool and spa,
facing south,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.164
so you know you get
the sun all day.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.749
Huge barbecue area.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.127
I mean, it's your own
private resort

04:12.168 --> 04:13.753
back here, right?

04:13.795 --> 04:16.423
So you've got the one bedroom
downstairs and four upstairs.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.466
It's about 5,000 square feet.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.301
- Have you
been doing this long?

04:20.343 --> 04:21.886
- Real estate?
- Mm-hmm.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.221
- Like five years.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.390
- Do you enjoy it?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.100
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.935
Actually, I mean, when you
meet a couple that, you know,

04:28.977 --> 04:30.729
finds their dream house,
a place where

04:30.770 --> 04:33.982
they wanna raise their family,
it's a really sweet moment.

04:34.024 --> 04:37.068

04:40.822 --> 04:44.576
[Siouxsie And The Banshees'
"The Passenger"]

04:44.617 --> 04:46.703
- Love the view.
- Hmm?

04:46.745 --> 04:47.787
- The view?
- Mm.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.290
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's a g--

05:09.225 --> 05:11.394

05:11.436 --> 05:15.106
- What's up, Jim?
Ladies, good morning.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.860
Tess, you gotta turn
your shoulders more.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.531
There it is.
- Thanks, Coach.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.162
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.999
You gotta try the yellowtail.
Herb's new menu is amazing.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.877
- Can we talk for a moment?
- Oh, yeah.

05:37.629 --> 05:42.717
- [laughs]
So what do you think?

05:42.759 --> 05:45.929
- Yeah, it's--
it's not quite what I'm after.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.681
- Okay.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.308
- Management wants
to make a change.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.893
- What kind of change?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.354
- They want
a new director of tennis.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.691
[apprehensive music]

05:57.732 --> 05:59.651
- Wait, what? Am I being fired?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.861
- Well, more like demoted.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.488
- I've been here for 17 years.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.365
- Yes, I think
that's part of the issue.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.866
- Wait, Michelle, I--

06:06.908 --> 06:09.160
I--I helped build this club.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.038
There was 200 members here
when I first arrived.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.791
- You don't have any other
Palisades listings, do you?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.585
- No, no, not this week, so--

06:17.627 --> 06:19.546
- But I did see you had
a few listings in Palms

06:19.587 --> 06:21.047
for one-bedroom apartments.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.553
- Yeah.
- Mason's taking over.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.054
- Mason?
- Yeah.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.974
- The new guy?
He's 25 years old.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.308
- 24.
- He is?

Come on, Amy.
- Oh.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.608
- Ooh, missed a shot
and take a shot.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.902
Come on, meet me here.
- That's not tennis.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.112
- Okay.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.739
- Yeah, but stay-at-home moms
love him.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.907
- They don't love him.
They're drunk.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.910
- I'm thinking you're stuck
in the low-end market.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.704
You can't get out,
and your boss gave you

06:52.746 --> 06:55.081
this listing as a favor.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.416
- [sighs]

06:56.458 --> 06:58.460
Well, you gotta start
somewhere, right?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.465
- You know I'm gonna be
a dad soon, right?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.758
- I have a family too.
- I know you do.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.301
You have a beautiful family.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.511
- And that's why Mason's in
and you're moving to red ball.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.849
- Red ball?
- I'm sorry.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.685
- That's for five-year-olds.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:15.727 --> 07:22.859

07:26.821 --> 07:29.240

no offers on the house.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
- Oh, fantastic.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.786
I just got fired.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.162
- What?
Are you serious?

07:34.204 --> 07:35.789
- Well, demoted.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.291
- I think the toilet's broken.
- Wait a minute, what happened?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.542
- I lost my power base.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.044
All the moms
moved over to Mason--

07:41.086 --> 07:43.046
Cardio and Cocktail.
- Mason, that young one?

07:43.088 --> 07:44.589
That new hot coach over there?
- Okay, take it easy.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.840
He's not that hot.
- This is bullshit.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.467
After everything
you've done for that place?

07:47.509 --> 07:50.136
- Yeah, I'm on commission--
red ball.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.304
- The five-year-olds?

07:51.346 --> 07:53.014
- Guys, hey, I need some help,
like, now.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.057
- Ugh, what?

07:54.099 --> 07:55.642
- What the fuck
is going on, Tory?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.185
- Oh, oh!
- [screams]

07:57.227 --> 07:58.520
- I don't know what to do!

07:58.561 --> 07:59.938
- What happened?
- I don't know.

07:59.979 --> 08:04.025
It just started overflowing.
- No!

08:04.067 --> 08:05.694
Oh, no.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.153
- Right this way.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.239
I've got quite a treat
for you here--

08:09.280 --> 08:12.450
our flagship product,
the Toto Aquia.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.660
- Ooh.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.704
- Automatic lid,
air dry, heated seat,

08:15.745 --> 08:20.291
bidet,
and a unique glazed throat

08:20.333 --> 08:22.043
that eliminates debris.

08:22.085 --> 08:26.214
- Oh, that sounds, uh, great,
but do you have any toilets?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.384
- I think he--
it's probably a little

08:29.426 --> 08:30.635
out of our price range.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.846
- It's $4,000.
- Ooh.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.681
- Yeah, do you have one
that you could

08:34.723 --> 08:36.558
just sit on and go poop?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.059
- Oh, my God.
- Is that available?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.894
- Are you serious?
- What?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.688
Yeah, money's tight.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.440
We're gonna be fine.
I have plans.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.858
You'll see.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.693
We're all gonna be living
in a Malibu beach house

08:46.735 --> 08:48.111
in no time, trust me.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.654
- Is it the tennis academy
that you've been

08:49.696 --> 08:51.031
talking about for years?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.323
Because I'm pretty sure
that ship has sailed.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.494
- No, actually,
it's a tennis podcast, right?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.204
I talk about my time
on the tour,

08:58.246 --> 08:59.247
the ups, the downs.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.415
I think people
will really like it.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.750
What do you think?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.044
- Okay, I don't think
anyone wants to listen

09:04.085 --> 09:06.046
to a podcast about tennis.
I'm sorry, I don't.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.048
But you know what
they do wanna listen to?

09:08.089 --> 09:09.341
Murder.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.967
- Not everyone's obsessed
with murder like you.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.970
- Yes, they are.
These things sell for millions.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.180
- Millions?
- Yes.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.181

"Sisters in Crime."

09:16.222 --> 09:17.724
It's like
the fucking gold rush.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.684
So unless you know someone
that got stabbed

09:19.726 --> 09:21.227
on center court Wimbledon,

09:21.269 --> 09:22.645
then maybe you should forget
about tennis.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.401
- Forget about tennis?

09:28.443 --> 09:29.694
Really?
- Not forget.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.654
You know what I mean.
- Forget about tennis?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.823
You want me to just forget
my whole life?

09:33.865 --> 09:35.075
- You think
I don't see you sitting

09:35.116 --> 09:36.951
on the toilet watching
old YouTube videos

09:36.993 --> 09:38.661
of the day you beat Federer?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.246
Do you really think
that's healthy?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.082
- Do you think it's healthy
to spend every night

09:42.123 --> 09:44.084
with a bunch of dead people?
Because I don't.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.086
- Uh, maybe I wouldn't have to
if we actually

09:46.127 --> 09:47.962
did something once in a while.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.297
The biggest thing we did
in the last three years

09:49.339 --> 09:51.257
is go buy a toilet
that costs 150 bucks.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.009
- Okay, so that's
what this is about.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.386
Why didn't you just say that?
It's about money.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.596
I'm sorry I didn't get you
the fucking Toto, babe.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.847
- It's not about the Toto.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.057
- I'm sorry it doesn't spray
up your ass.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.433
- It's not about the Toto!

10:00.475 --> 10:02.102
- So why do you keep talking
about money, then?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.853
- I'm not! You brought it up.
You're making it about money.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.438
Money's not the problem.
What happened to us?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.982
We used to be
the cool, fun tennis couple.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.734
We used to support each other.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.528
We were gonna conquer
the world together.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
Like, what the fuck happened?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.447
- Okay, so what you're saying
is, I'm the problem.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.949
- Oh, my God.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.325
- I'm the problem
'cause I failed, right?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.202
- You always do this.
- Yeah, yeah, I failed you.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.453
I got hurt.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.788
Then I got my ass fired,

10:21.830 --> 10:23.039
and now I can't get you
the mansion

10:23.081 --> 10:24.916
like all your fancy
fucking friends.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.084
- Oh.
- You knew who you married.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.252
- You know what, I didn't,

10:27.293 --> 10:28.670
because you're not the guy
I married.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.842
- What did you say?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.135
- You're obviously
the guy I married.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.886
That's not what I meant.
- That's what you said.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.513
- I know that,
but that's not how--

10:38.555 --> 10:40.432
it came out wrong.
Come on, please don't do this.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.600
- I'm sorry
I'm not the guy you married.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.269
[soft tense music]

10:44.310 --> 10:46.896
And I'm sorry I got hurt.
I'm really sorry.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.648
- Oh, my God, come on.
- I'm sorry I got fired.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.150
I'm sorry
I have no fucking money.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.318
I'm sorry I'm old.
I'm sorry I got no friends.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.571
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.865
- It came out wrong.
Babe, I'm sorry.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.867
Babe, please.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.245
* *

11:02.287 --> 11:05.165
- Gonna be a big tennis champ?

11:05.206 --> 11:08.084
Gonna impress your daddy?
Gonna impress your wife?

11:08.126 --> 11:10.378
You can't do shit.
You can't do it.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.839
You can't fucking do it.
You're gonna fucking--

11:12.881 --> 11:14.132
you know, I'm done.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.718
I'm fucking--I'm fucking done!

11:16.760 --> 11:18.303
- The great American art form

11:18.345 --> 11:21.598
isn't music or film
or television.

11:21.639 --> 11:25.977
The great American art form
is murder.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.897
We watch it. We celebrate it.

11:28.938 --> 11:34.527
We obsess over it,
and we commit it.

11:34.569 --> 11:39.324
What drives someone
to murder another human being?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.702
What kind of person
could do that?

11:42.744 --> 11:45.705
[tense music]

11:45.747 --> 11:52.879
* *

11:58.385 --> 11:59.386
[doorbell chimes]

11:59.427 --> 12:01.262
- Hey, I'm Matt, plumber.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.430
- Hi.
- Great.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.515
We need you. Come on in.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.102
- Oh, one sec. Sorry.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.853
Never bring dirt into a home.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.730
That's a priority.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.732
Okay, one more second,
Yep, almost done.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.110
- Right down this way.
- Great, thanks.

12:15.151 --> 12:19.239
- Down the hall here.
- Hey, is that, uh,

12:19.280 --> 12:21.408
is that Binghamton?
- Yeah, I grew up near there.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.450
- No way.
- Yeah.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.868
- Me too.
- Really?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.620
- Yeah, they had
that great ice cream store.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.372
- Slippy's, oh.
- Oh, my God.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.623
- Best mint chip ever.
- Right?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.792
- Oh.
- Man, small world.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.460
- Can you believe that?
- It's nuts.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.628
You wanna--
you wanna head back?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.046
- Yeah.
Well, uh, toilet awaits.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.548
- Let's do it, yeah.
So it's down here.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.717
It's just--it's a gusher.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.385
- Hey.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.345
- Hot plumber.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.680
- I know.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.560
- American Standard
is a solid unit.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.437
They try to upsell you
on the Toto?

12:50.478 --> 12:52.397
- They did, actually.
- They always do.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.940
It's bullshit.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.900
I mean, who needs a toilet
for a status symbol, right?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.694
- Yeah, that's exactly
what I think.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.654
- Yeah?

12:59.696 --> 13:02.449
Hey, can I ask you something?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.701
- Sure.
- I saw that wall out there.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.703
That--that was you, right?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.455
I mean,
all those tennis trophies.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.332
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
I won a lot of juniors.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.835
- Yeah, no, I remember you.
- Really?

13:13.877 --> 13:16.129
- Yeah, you were gonna be,
like, the next Agassi, right?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.757
- That's what they said
until I blew my knee out.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.718
- Ah, that's a bummer.
- Never really made it back.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.136
Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.387
You know, I play a little.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.972
Nothing like you,
just, you know,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.015
I hit with my buddies.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.266
They used to have
these great courts

13:28.308 --> 13:29.851
near my apartment in Pomona.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.145
- Pomona? You live in Pomona?
That's a drive.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.688
- Oh, no, no, no, I used to.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.940
You know, it got too dangerous.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.109
Someone got attacked
in my building.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.737
So I took off, came to LA,

13:40.779 --> 13:44.199
you know...for the glamour.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.950
You know? You still hit?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.912
- I coach
over at the Beverly Club.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.413
- Oh, wow.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.540
I bet they're glad to have
someone as good as you around.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.127
- Yeah, yeah,
they're very excited, yeah.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.172
- I don't know,
if you ever got time, I'd--

13:59.214 --> 14:00.340
I'd love to hit.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.050
- Uh, sure, yeah.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.593
I mean, I'd kick
the shit out of you.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.470
- It would be my honor,
you know?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.013
[both laugh]

14:07.055 --> 14:10.392
All right, you are...

14:10.433 --> 14:12.435
[groans]
Ready for action.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.437
- Fantastic.
- Hey, guys.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.730
Hi, Matt, can you check
one more thing

14:15.772 --> 14:17.732
while you're here?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.026
- What's up?
- Well...

14:20.068 --> 14:21.277
wait, is that mold?

14:21.319 --> 14:23.321
Ugh, Stachybotrys.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.781
- Stachy what?
- Oh.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.241
- It's a type of mold.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.742
You're gonna have
to rip the whole thing out.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.868
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.745
The whole thing?
- Yeah.

14:30.787 --> 14:34.040
- Oh, shit.
- [groans]

14:34.082 --> 14:37.627
- Okay. Um...
- This is not good.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.921
- We're gonna be fine.
- Mm.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.382
- I'm just curious how much
you think that might run us.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.384
- Oh, I--
I mean, it's a big job.

14:44.426 --> 14:48.513
It's not gonna be cheap.
- Yeah, yeah, I figured that.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.765
We're having
a little cash-flow situation.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.892
Not a big deal.
We're gonna be fine.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.769
But I was just thinking, what--

14:54.811 --> 14:57.147
would you be up
for doing a deal?

14:57.188 --> 15:00.442
How about three months
of free tennis lessons

15:00.483 --> 15:04.654
with this guy?
- Oh, uh...

15:06.239 --> 15:07.782
- Twice a week?

15:07.824 --> 15:10.452
[upbeat rock music]

15:10.493 --> 15:13.246
Elbow up. Head still.

15:13.288 --> 15:17.167
Finish high. Kiss the bicep.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.211
- Oh, the student
has become the master.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.546
- Nice shot.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.049
- I guess that makes me
better than Federer, huh?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.592
- Okay.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.635
- You're gonna have to give me
one of your fancy trophies.

15:27.677 --> 15:32.807
- Here we go. There it is.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.934
- Okay.
- Gotta run.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.770
- Oh!
- Try to use your feet.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.064
- [grunts]
- You having fun yet?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.940
- [grunting]

15:40.982 --> 15:43.902
All right, all right,
I surrender.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.695
You win.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.281
- We could go again.
- No, man.

15:48.323 --> 15:52.160
No, no, no,
that was fucking exhausting.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.079
You're so good.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.665
- We'll get you there.
- Ah.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.001
- You got a good forehand.
- Hmm?

16:00.043 --> 16:03.046
- Backhand is shit.
- [laughs]

16:04.714 --> 16:06.800
What's going on there?

16:06.841 --> 16:10.428
- They call that
Thirsty Thursdays.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.180
This used to be my kingdom.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.017
LA, right?

16:16.059 --> 16:17.727
It's a brutal city,
especially when

16:17.769 --> 16:21.356
you're pushing 50.
I'm just invisible.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.359
- Yeah? Try being a plumber.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.568
- [laughs]

16:27.404 --> 16:29.864
- Hey, man, Thirsty Thursday.
- Oh, shit.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.200
- Half-price cocktails.
What do you say?

16:32.242 --> 16:33.993
- Ah, we're good, thanks.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.578
I'm just in the middle
of a lesson right now.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.664
- What's up, brother?
- Hey.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.750
- Coach,
can I get you for a second?

16:42.252 --> 16:45.672
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah, fine.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.216
- What's up?

16:48.258 --> 16:49.300
- Hey.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.887
I just wanted to say, uh,

16:52.929 --> 16:55.181
I had nothing to do
with what went down.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.808
Okay, I didn't ask
for your position.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.561
They just, like, gave it to me.
- Yeah.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.229
- And I feel
really bad about it

17:01.271 --> 17:04.399
because I have been
a huge fan of yours.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.985
A long time, coming up,
when I was a little kid,

17:07.027 --> 17:08.737
you know?
- Yeah, it's fine.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.864
I got Riviera chasing me,
Mulholland chasing me.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.574
- Oh, that's great. Fuck yeah.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.825
- Yeah, it's great.
- Okay, cool.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.993
And you know what?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.369
If that doesn't pan out
for you,

17:16.411 --> 17:18.038
I've actually been talking
to the club

17:18.079 --> 17:21.416
about keeping you on here
as coach emeritus.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.252
- [laughs]
Coach emeritus?

17:24.294 --> 17:25.754
- It's Latin.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.506
It means, like,
a respected elder.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.716
- Really?
Is that what it means?

17:29.758 --> 17:31.009
- Yeah.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.260
I thought
it might be a nice way

17:32.302 --> 17:34.179
to just kick some cash
your way and--

17:34.220 --> 17:35.764
- I don't need
your fucking cash.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.433
[tense music]

17:38.475 --> 17:40.769
- Okay.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.604
I hear you, big guy.
Um...

17:42.645 --> 17:45.732
* *

17:45.774 --> 17:47.984
All right.
- Anything else?

17:50.028 --> 17:51.696
- I'll see you around.
It's all good.

17:51.738 --> 17:58.870
* *

18:07.545 --> 18:08.963
- Cheers!
- Love you guys.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.674
- I wish I was drinking that
instead of this shit.

18:10.715 --> 18:11.758
- So have you gotten
to the part

18:11.800 --> 18:13.885
where he swaps the head?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.429
- Da, da, da,
no spoilers, no spoilers.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.681
- That's not a spoiler.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.099
- It is a spoiler
'cause you said "he."

18:19.140 --> 18:20.183
So now I know
the killer is a he.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.351
- Well, of course,
the killer is he.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.269
It's not a she.
Women do not swap heads.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.813
That is not something that...
- See you guys later.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.481
- We would do.
- Oh, okay.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.774
- Hey.
- Tori, Tori.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.318
- Okay, hello.
- Does someone have a date?

18:30.360 --> 18:33.238
- No, nobody goes on a date.
It's like a Tinder fuck fest.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.865
- That's true.
- No, don't say that.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.534
Listen, I had a friend
go on a Tinder date.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.910
Everything was going great.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.120
They watched "The Notebook"
until he tied her up

18:40.161 --> 18:42.247
and pooped in her mouth.
- Was it consensual?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.998
- That's crazy.
- No, you're right.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.709
I should just stay here
and get drunk

18:45.750 --> 18:48.128
and talk about
heads being cut off.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.714
- Okay, what do you even know
about this guy, though?

18:50.755 --> 18:51.840
Seriously, don't you wanna meet
someone,

18:51.881 --> 18:52.966
like, responsible and--and--

18:53.008 --> 18:55.135
- No, no,
I prefer the fuck-ups.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.929
They're way more fun.
One more thing.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.764
Should I use protection,
or should he just pull out?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.182
You know,
if I end up on "Dateline,"

19:01.224 --> 19:03.476
I can leave a massive
DNA trail for you weirdos.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.186
- Yes! Get that DNA!

19:05.228 --> 19:06.938
- The more,
the better, honestly.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.314
- Save it, bring it home.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.775
- You're always thinking ahead.
- I like that.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.944
- All right,
you guys don't get too crazy.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.363
- Okay, do it for us, girl.
- Brilliant.

and hot and young.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.119

19:21.161 --> 19:22.454
Look at us,
always sitting around,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.165
drinking wine,
talking about vicious murders.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.083
Like, what is wrong with us?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.299
- So after
he swapped the heads?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.009
- Yes.
- Right.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.052
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.428
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:38.470 --> 19:40.180
Why are you
so fucking good at darts?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.766
- Oh, man, you know, I spent
a lot of tequila time here

19:42.807 --> 19:44.851
when my marriage
was going under.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.520
Ah, fuck. I jinxed myself.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.606
- You guys didn't make it?

19:49.647 --> 19:51.107
- You know what? We tried.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.402
I mean, we went to therapy,
went to Fiji.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.737
Had a baby.

19:55.779 --> 19:58.114
- You had a baby
to save your marriage?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.491
Shit.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.326
You're the last guy
I should be hanging out with.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.954
- Oh, no, dude, I mean,
you know, sorry, it's just--

20:04.996 --> 20:07.123
I'm just being real.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.876
People do crazy shit
in a bad marriage.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.130
The lesson is,
I should have just let it die.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.717
- I would totally date
a guy in prison.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.636
- No, you would not.
- I would.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.012

20:21.054 --> 20:22.847

excited to see you.

You always know where they are.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.934

- Oh, yes.

their exes on Insta.

- No wet spot.

it actually sounds
kind of perfect.

- I know.
[laughter]

20:34.526 --> 20:35.610

I feel like affairs

20:35.652 --> 20:36.653

20:36.695 --> 20:37.862
Like, you gotta delete texts.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.114
You've gotta get
rid of your phone,

20:39.155 --> 20:40.448

that leads to them.

Okay, okay, so it sounds
like someone--you--

20:43.868 --> 20:45.161

of thought into that.

like, talk about it?

No, we just have quiet,
desperate affairs,

21:29.456 --> 21:30.874
you gotta keep the marriage
alive somehow.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.807
I just got bitched out
by a six-year-old.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.642
- What time
did you get home last night?

28:45.684 --> 28:48.061
- Well, you were asleep
and I didn't wanna wake you.

28:48.103 --> 28:51.773
- What time did you get in?

28:51.815 --> 28:53.566
- What's with
all the questions?

28:55.485 --> 28:57.612
You were looking at my laptop?

28:57.654 --> 28:59.531
- Who is she
and what the hell is going on?

29:01.199 --> 29:04.327
- That is the craziest story.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.496
You won't believe it.
- Try me.

29:06.538 --> 29:09.207
- Okay, well, I'm out with Matt
last night at the bar.

29:09.249 --> 29:11.209
I go to get drinks, and, boom,

29:11.251 --> 29:12.585
that girl comes out
of the bathroom.

29:12.627 --> 29:14.879
She bumps into me--
I mean, full-on hip checks me.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.589
I say sorry. She says sorry.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.509
I don't think anything of it.
She takes off, gone.

29:19.551 --> 29:22.262
This morning,
I check out the news.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.390
I find out
she was murdered last night.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.684
- So this girl
was with you at the bar

29:27.726 --> 29:29.978
last night before
she was killed?

29:30.020 --> 29:31.688
- No, no, she wasn't with me.

29:31.730 --> 29:34.399
She bumped into me,
and now she's dead.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.945
It's unbelievable.

29:41.072 --> 29:42.699
- Okay, so you--

29:42.741 --> 29:45.201
then you googled her
because she was murdered?

29:45.243 --> 29:48.246
- Yeah, I mean, it's weird.

29:48.288 --> 29:51.958
It just freaked me out.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.340
* *

29:58.381 --> 30:01.051
- They think
it was the Westside Ripper.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.510
- Really?

30:02.552 --> 30:05.597
- I mean, maybe he was
at the bar last night.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.932
Maybe you even saw him.
Did anyone look suspicious?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.893
- There was one guy
she was with.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.227
It looked like a date.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.187
- Okay, no,
that wouldn't be him.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.688
- How do you know?

30:13.730 --> 30:15.148
- No serial killer is gonna
take someone out in public

30:15.190 --> 30:17.275
and then kill them after.
That's not the Ripper's style.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.235
Trust me,
I know my serial killers.

30:19.277 --> 30:22.322
And this one
is still out there.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.449
* *

30:29.579 --> 30:31.581
- I can't believe that Nathan
knew the girl that got killed.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.583
- Oh, no, no, no,
he didn't know-know her.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.001
He just accidentally
bumped into her.

30:35.043 --> 30:38.296
- But, still,
that is, like, so creepy.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.631
- It's not that creepy.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.049
It just was a thing
that, you know--

30:41.091 --> 30:42.842
- And it wasn't just,
like, a regular killer.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.219
I mean, this is the big kahuna.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.346
This is the Westside Ripper.
- Yeah, I know who--

30:46.388 --> 30:47.389
- And I bet you anything
the cops

30:47.430 --> 30:50.767
are gonna wanna interview him.

30:50.809 --> 30:53.645
Uh, the--excuse me, sir.
- Okay, I'm--

30:53.687 --> 30:56.064
[phone chimes]

30:56.106 --> 30:57.399
- Thank you.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.402
[suspenseful music]

31:00.443 --> 31:03.822
* *

31:03.863 --> 31:05.407
- There's been
a potential breakthrough

31:05.448 --> 31:07.409
in the recent
Westside Ripper murder

31:07.450 --> 31:09.202
of 28-year-old Chloe Lake.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.329
Kelly Monroe
has more at the scene.

31:11.371 --> 31:12.455
- Thank you, Lynette.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.416
Police sources here
have revealed

31:14.457 --> 31:17.419
that the killer left something
behind in this alley...

31:17.460 --> 31:20.797
* *

31:20.839 --> 31:22.757
[tires squealing]

31:22.799 --> 31:24.217
- Ava, where are you--

31:26.094 --> 31:27.095
Oh, my God.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.265
- Hey, Google,
call Nathan's cell.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.017
Call Nathan's cell.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.601
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

31:33.643 --> 31:36.563
[phone buzzing]

31:36.604 --> 31:38.565
Come on!

31:38.606 --> 31:45.655
* *

31:46.156 --> 31:48.658
- Hey, brother.
- Hey.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.910
- How's it looking?
- Yeah, pretty good.

31:53.246 --> 31:55.790
- I got the craziest story
for you from the other night.

31:55.832 --> 32:02.797
* *

32:02.839 --> 32:04.758
You're not gonna believe it.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.509
So I come out--
- Nate.

32:06.551 --> 32:08.136
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

32:08.178 --> 32:09.721
Can you help me with something
in the bedroom real quick?

32:09.763 --> 32:11.222
- Yeah, sure, one sec.
- No, now, actually.

32:11.264 --> 32:13.350
I just need you super fast.
Hey, Matt.

32:13.391 --> 32:14.476
- Hey.
- Just--

32:14.517 --> 32:16.561
[whispering]
Come here.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.979
- Okay.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.023
- Hey.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.443
What's going on?
- Yeah.

32:25.278 --> 32:26.613
- Jesus, what is it?
Are you okay?

32:26.654 --> 32:27.864
- I need you to stay calm

32:27.906 --> 32:28.907
so I can show you something
real quick.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.408
Okay?
- Okay.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.285
- Kelly Monroe has more.
- I love Kelly Monroe.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.371
- It's not about her.
- Thanks, Lynette.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.456
Police sources here
have revealed

32:36.498 --> 32:39.584
that the killer left something
behind in this alley--

32:39.626 --> 32:42.003
a blood-soaked blue bootie...

32:42.045 --> 32:43.630
- Yeah.
- There it is.

32:43.672 --> 32:46.716
- Worn over shoes by a variety
of home-service providers.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.343
LAPD forensics
is working on...

32:51.388 --> 32:53.264
- Yeah.

32:53.306 --> 32:57.227
* *

32:57.268 --> 32:58.853
- That doesn't--

32:58.895 --> 33:01.147
I mean, what are you saying?

33:01.189 --> 33:03.108
- Did Matt notice the girl
at the bar the other night?

33:03.149 --> 33:04.526
- What girl?
- The--

33:04.567 --> 33:07.570
the DB, the dead body,
the girl that was murdered.

33:07.612 --> 33:09.072
- He left right after she did.

33:09.114 --> 33:10.782
- Oh, my God, he followed her.
Holy shit.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.450
Oh, my God, okay, okay.

33:12.492 --> 33:14.994
Matt showed up
this morning with scratches

33:15.036 --> 33:17.205
all over his arms.
- What?

33:17.247 --> 33:20.000
- Yes, yes, big, red, angry,
new scratches, okay?

33:20.041 --> 33:22.210
And he said his cat did it.

33:22.252 --> 33:25.755
- I don't think he has a cat.
- Mm.

33:25.797 --> 33:28.341
I'm telling you, it's Matt.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.636
Matt is the Westside Ripper.
I know my killers.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.139
It is him,
and he is right there.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.975
- But he can't be. It can't be.

33:37.017 --> 33:38.309
- Okay, do you wanna--

33:38.351 --> 33:39.728
do you wanna just go in
and ask him?

33:39.769 --> 33:41.730
Because he has the same
blue booties as the killer.

33:41.771 --> 33:43.231
He followed
the girl out of the bar,

33:43.273 --> 33:44.941
and an hour later,
she was stabbed 37 times,

33:44.983 --> 33:46.526
and then he waltzes in
this morning

33:46.568 --> 33:48.236
with don't-kill-me scratches
on his arms

33:48.278 --> 33:50.363
from his imaginary cat.
- Okay.

33:50.405 --> 33:51.448
- What more do you want?

33:51.489 --> 33:52.907
- I've hung out with him
a dozen times.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.076
- Mm.
- He's just a normal guy.

33:55.118 --> 33:56.786
- Okay, do you think Ted Bundy
wore a T-shirt--

33:56.828 --> 33:58.288
"I fuck corpses"?
- I beg you.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.457
You gotta stop listening
to these podcasts, please.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.292
- What do you guys talk about?
How well do you know him?

34:02.334 --> 34:04.252
What's--what's going on with
your little friend over there?

34:04.294 --> 34:05.754
- What do you mean?
We talk all the time.

34:05.795 --> 34:07.380
- What do you talk about?
- Just normal stuff, guy stuff.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.423
- Like what? What?

34:08.465 --> 34:10.091
- Well, he told
me he's got a kid.

34:10.133 --> 34:12.260
Dating in LA,
you know, it sucks.

34:12.302 --> 34:15.096
He used to live in Pomona.
- Pomona.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.766
Okay, what'd he say about that?
Anything?

34:17.807 --> 34:19.934
What? What? What?

34:21.102 --> 34:23.313
- He said
he moved to Los Angeles

34:23.355 --> 34:26.191
because someone got attacked
in his apartment building.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.651
- Shut up. Are you serious?

34:28.693 --> 34:30.570
Attacked in his building
in Pomona?

34:30.612 --> 34:31.738
- That's what he said.

34:31.780 --> 34:32.947
- Oh, my God, please.
Okay, what else?

34:32.989 --> 34:34.532
What else? When was that?

34:34.574 --> 34:36.868
- I mean, I think it was,
like, two years ago.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.286
- Two years ago, okay.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.246
Hey, Google,
search unsolved murders

34:40.288 --> 34:44.292
Pomona apartment building 2021.
Okay.

34:44.334 --> 34:45.794
- 24 murders?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.337
What the fuck
is up with Pomona?

34:47.379 --> 34:49.422
- Wait, we gotta narrow down
our suspects here, let's see.

34:49.464 --> 34:51.800
Unsolved murder
of 82-year-old Sharon Simpson.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.176
That's--that's not a thing.

34:53.218 --> 34:57.347
He murders really young,
hot brunettes like--

34:57.389 --> 34:59.224
like this one.

34:59.265 --> 35:02.143
Murder in apartment building,
242 Park Street.

35:02.185 --> 35:03.853
Police found the victim,
Nicole Gibson, stabbed.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.271
That is the girl from Pomona.

35:05.313 --> 35:06.648
- Okay, type in the address.
- That is just--

35:06.690 --> 35:07.982
- Do bird's eye...
- Okay.

35:08.024 --> 35:09.442
- 'Cause he said that...
- Oh, gosh.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.152
- His apartment building
was next to some tennis courts.

35:11.194 --> 35:12.112
- Okay, bird's eye.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.530
- Yeah.
- Tennis courts.

35:13.571 --> 35:14.989
You mean those tennis courts?
Oh, my God.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.324
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

35:16.366 --> 35:17.575
- Oh, shit.

35:17.617 --> 35:19.786
- It is him. I knew it.
- Lower your voice.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.329
- He killed this girl
in Pomona, and now he's here.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.164
He's the Westside
fucking Ripper.

35:23.206 --> 35:25.000
I guess he didn't find me
attractive enough to kill,

35:25.041 --> 35:26.167
but whatever.
- Oh, really?

35:26.209 --> 35:27.544
Really?
- I'm just saying.

35:27.585 --> 35:28.878
- I'm sure there'll be
other serial killers

35:28.920 --> 35:30.130
that find you hot enough
to kill.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.423
- I'm just saying.

35:31.464 --> 35:33.174
- Why would he
just mention Pomona?

35:33.216 --> 35:34.384
He just volunteered it.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.011
- Because he's
getting off on it.

35:36.052 --> 35:37.053
He is gloating.
This is what they do.

35:37.095 --> 35:38.972
I know these guys.

35:39.014 --> 35:41.016
BTK, Zodiac, they love
to secretly boast

35:41.057 --> 35:42.350
that no one can actually
catch them.

35:42.392 --> 35:43.727
Think about it. Think about it.

35:43.768 --> 35:46.354
To the outside world,
Matt is just the toilet guy,

35:46.396 --> 35:47.856
but deep inside,
he has a secret--

35:47.897 --> 35:49.607
a huge, powerful secret.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.109
I mean, can you imagine
if they knew

35:51.151 --> 35:53.111
he was the Westside Ripper?
- Hey, guys?

35:53.153 --> 35:54.529
- Hey.

35:54.571 --> 35:55.905
- Hi.

35:57.532 --> 36:01.077
- Uh, sorry,
I'm just headed out, but, um,

36:01.119 --> 36:03.288
what did you want to tell me
back there?

36:03.329 --> 36:04.581
- Hmm?

36:04.622 --> 36:06.875
* *

36:06.916 --> 36:08.752
- What was it I was gonna--
- Mm.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.962
- Yeah, back there.

36:11.004 --> 36:13.423
- I--
- Before?

36:13.465 --> 36:15.258
- When we were back there?
- Yeah.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.802
- Hmm. What did you--

36:17.844 --> 36:19.721
- I have--
you know, it's crazy.

36:19.763 --> 36:20.889
I have no idea.

36:20.930 --> 36:23.350
- Oh, my God, babe.
- No idea?

36:23.391 --> 36:24.559
- He does this
all the time now.

36:24.601 --> 36:25.852
I'm worried.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.020
- Oh, no,
we'll get it worked on.

36:27.062 --> 36:29.147
- Call the doctor for you.
- Yeah.

36:29.189 --> 36:31.066
- You'll get old like this guy.

36:31.107 --> 36:35.070
- Well, listen, in that case,

36:35.111 --> 36:36.571
I got some bad news.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.865
- Mm-hmm.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.618
* *

36:41.659 --> 36:43.578
- The last hot water pipe,
it's leaking.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.580
- Oh.
- Look, I tried to patch it.

36:45.622 --> 36:46.873
- [coughs]

36:46.915 --> 36:47.791
- We're gonna have
to change it out.

36:47.832 --> 36:48.917
I just didn't wanna--

36:48.958 --> 36:50.168
- Oh, my God.
- Sure.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.252
- You guys to curse me
when I'm gone, you know?

36:51.294 --> 36:52.420
- You?
- We would--

36:52.462 --> 36:53.546
- We would--

36:53.588 --> 36:54.714
- You're the last person
we would curse.

36:54.756 --> 36:55.799
- Never.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.008
- Okay, well, you know, I'll--

36:57.050 --> 36:58.718
I'll pick one up,
bring it back tomorrow.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.345
- Yeah.
- All right?

37:00.387 --> 37:02.472
You know, it's gonna cost you
a few more lessons.

37:02.514 --> 37:03.682
- Absolutely.

37:03.723 --> 37:05.975
- And just--just call me
if you wanna throw.

37:06.017 --> 37:08.770
- Sure.
- Yeah?

37:08.812 --> 37:11.189
[dramatic music]

37:11.231 --> 37:12.774
- Is he going?
- He's walking.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.275
He's leaving.
- Okay.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.527
- He's leaving. He's leaving.
- Just keep an eye on him.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.113
I'll call 911,
get a SWAT team on his ass.

37:18.154 --> 37:19.948
[line trilling]

37:19.989 --> 37:23.410
* *

37:23.451 --> 37:25.370
- What the hell are you doing?

37:25.412 --> 37:27.622
- Let's think this through.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.791
- Think this--what the fu--
what does that mean?

37:29.833 --> 37:31.960
We have a fucking
serial killer in our house.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.503
He could come back any second.

37:33.545 --> 37:35.672
- I know, I know, but someone
is gonna jump on this, okay?

37:35.714 --> 37:37.132
You can call 911.

37:37.173 --> 37:38.174
And, sure,
he's gonna get arrested.

37:38.216 --> 37:39.592
There'll be a trial.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.052
Someone will write a book
about this, guaranteed.

37:41.094 --> 37:42.721
- This isn't one
of your podcasts.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.931
- But it is.

37:44.973 --> 37:47.392
It is exactly
like one of my podcasts,

37:47.434 --> 37:49.728
except it's happening to us.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.648
What if we do it?

37:53.690 --> 37:55.567
What if-what if we make
a podcast about this together,

37:55.608 --> 37:57.652
you and me?
We--we own this story.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.154
- You're out
of your fucking mind.

37:59.195 --> 38:00.405
- No, think about it.

38:00.447 --> 38:02.157
We could bring him in
on it.

38:02.198 --> 38:03.616
- Bring the killer in on what?

38:03.658 --> 38:05.285
- The podcast.
We force him to do it.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.828
Oh, my God, this has
never been done before.

38:06.870 --> 38:09.414
- Yeah, you know why?
Because he'd fucking kill us.

38:09.456 --> 38:11.374
- No, no,
he will not kill us,

38:11.416 --> 38:13.376
because that's
the beauty of it.

38:13.418 --> 38:14.919
We will stop him from killing.

38:14.961 --> 38:17.630
We will say, "Sir, no more
killing or we go to the cops."

38:17.672 --> 38:19.174
No one ever gets hurt
ever again,

38:19.215 --> 38:20.383
and that's because of us.

38:20.425 --> 38:22.052
- Okay, so we force him
to do a podcast,

38:22.093 --> 38:23.887
"My Plumber,
The Serial Killer."

38:23.928 --> 38:25.555
And then, after a few months,

38:25.597 --> 38:28.350
we secretly turn him over
to the cops when we're done.

38:28.391 --> 38:29.934
- Exactly, yes,
except we call it

38:29.976 --> 38:31.478
"A Murderer Speaks."

38:31.519 --> 38:34.147
No, no, no, no, we call it
"The Westside Ripper Speaks."

38:34.189 --> 38:36.191
Whatever, something like that.
I mean, we're gonna brand it.

38:36.232 --> 38:37.776
Oh, my God,
this is gonna go viral.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.277
And we'll make him answer.

38:39.319 --> 38:41.696
You know, why does he do it?
How? Why doesn't he quit?

38:41.738 --> 38:43.365
Everything, straight from
the mouth of a serial killer

38:43.406 --> 38:44.699
who's still out there.

38:44.741 --> 38:46.534
Oh, my God,
we'll disguise his voice.

38:46.576 --> 38:49.120
People are gonna go nuts.
This is gonna change our lives!

38:49.162 --> 38:50.747
- You really think
the Westside Ripper

38:50.789 --> 38:52.165
is gonna do this?

38:52.207 --> 38:53.875
- Okay, either he does
a podcast or he goes to prison

38:53.917 --> 38:56.586
for the rest of his life.
What would you choose?

38:56.628 --> 38:58.129
- What would I do?
- Yeah.

39:00.173 --> 39:02.217
Look, you can--
you can call 911,

39:02.258 --> 39:03.593
but how are you gonna feel?

39:03.635 --> 39:04.969
How are you gonna feel when
the girl from "Serial"

39:05.011 --> 39:07.389
shows up, or "Crime Junkie,"
or "Sisters in Crime"?

39:07.430 --> 39:08.807
And then it's their story.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.226
It's not ours anymore.
Sure, they'll interview us.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.686
We'll have
our little five minutes,

39:12.727 --> 39:14.396
but that'll be it, and then,
you, me, and this baby

39:14.437 --> 39:16.231
are gonna have to go live
in a one-bedroom apartment

39:16.272 --> 39:17.524
because we can't afford
the mortgage.

39:17.565 --> 39:18.983
You're gonna go back
to red ball.

39:19.025 --> 39:21.319
I'll go back to sitting
in an empty open house,

39:21.361 --> 39:22.862
you know, hustling for 3%

39:22.904 --> 39:24.239
while I'm sitting there
having sexual fantasies

39:24.280 --> 39:26.408
about my buyers.
- Wait, you what?

39:26.449 --> 39:27.701
- I don't--I don't know
why I said that.

39:27.742 --> 39:28.993
I'm pregnant
and saying crazy shit.

39:29.035 --> 39:30.412
I mean--

39:30.453 --> 39:32.622
- You have sexual fantasies
about your buyers?

39:32.664 --> 39:35.083
- Okay, babe, do you know we're
the only couple stupid enough

39:35.125 --> 39:36.501
not to be having affairs?

39:37.711 --> 39:39.004
- Is that true?

39:39.045 --> 39:41.006
- Listen, let's do this,

39:41.047 --> 39:44.134
you and me together, please.

39:45.427 --> 39:47.512
We are good people, okay?

39:47.554 --> 39:50.598
We have played by the rules
and look where it got us.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.144
But now, finally--
finally, some good luck.

39:54.185 --> 39:56.730
A serial killer
has fallen into our laps.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.023
- That's good luck?

39:58.064 --> 39:59.899
- Yes, God put him
in our kitchen for a reason.

39:59.941 --> 40:01.526
- We should be thanking God
that that fucker

40:01.568 --> 40:03.486
hasn't killed us,
not for bringing him

40:03.528 --> 40:04.946
into our lives.
- Come on, please.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.448
- No.

40:11.953 --> 40:12.912
No.

40:22.172 --> 40:25.008
[phone buzzing]

40:25.050 --> 40:28.136
- 911 is calling me.
- Answer it, tell them.

40:28.178 --> 40:30.638
[phone buzzing]

40:30.680 --> 40:32.557
- Someone called 911
from this number.

40:32.599 --> 40:35.685
Is there an emergency?

40:35.727 --> 40:38.813
[Queen and David Bowie's
"Under Pressure"]

40:38.855 --> 40:40.357
[upbeat rock music]

40:40.398 --> 40:43.902
Hello? Is everything okay?

40:43.943 --> 40:46.529
Is there an emergency?

40:46.571 --> 40:49.032
Hello? Is everything okay?

40:49.074 --> 40:51.993
- [vocalizing]

40:52.035 --> 40:57.540
* *

40:57.582 --> 41:01.169
- * Pressure
pushing down on me *

41:01.211 --> 41:03.171
* Pressing down on you *

41:03.213 --> 41:05.340
* No man ask for *

41:05.382 --> 41:07.133
- * Under pressure *

41:07.175 --> 41:09.469
* That burns a building down *

41:09.511 --> 41:12.055
* Splits a family in two *

41:12.097 --> 41:14.724
- * Puts people on streets *

- [vocalizing]

41:17.852 --> 41:20.897
* *

41:20.939 --> 41:22.565
* That's okay *

41:22.607 --> 41:27.153
- * It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about *

41:27.195 --> 41:30.949
* Watching some good friends
screaming let me out *

41:30.990 --> 41:35.203
- * Pray tomorrow
gets me higher *

41:35.245 --> 41:40.083
- * Pressure on people,
people on streets *

41:40.125 --> 41:42.419
- Hey.

41:42.460 --> 41:47.674
* *

41:47.716 --> 41:50.885
Man, great spot.

41:50.927 --> 41:53.680
- Right?

41:53.722 --> 41:55.515
- You good?
- Oh, yeah.

41:55.557 --> 41:56.891
You?
- Yeah.

41:56.933 --> 41:58.977
All right,
show me what you got.

42:01.271 --> 42:03.314
How'd you find this place?

42:08.695 --> 42:11.406
- I didn't really ask you
to go out here to surf.

42:11.448 --> 42:12.741
- Oh, yeah?

42:12.782 --> 42:16.327
What--what are we doing here?

42:18.955 --> 42:21.332
- I wanted you to see
that no one was around.

42:21.374 --> 42:23.293
- Uh.

42:23.335 --> 42:25.587
- No one's watching.
No one's listening.

42:25.628 --> 42:28.423
- All right.
- It's just us.

42:28.465 --> 42:31.593
- I'm not wearing a wire.
You can pat me down.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.261
- [chuckles]
Check you for--

42:33.303 --> 42:35.305
why would I wanna do that?

42:37.474 --> 42:39.517
- I know who you are.

42:41.353 --> 42:42.937
- Who I am?

42:44.314 --> 42:46.816
- A serial killer.

42:49.652 --> 42:51.404
The Westside Ripper.

42:51.446 --> 42:54.366
[tense music]

42:54.407 --> 43:00.288

43:00.330 --> 43:04.417
- [laughs]
All right, this is a--

43:04.459 --> 43:06.002
this is a joke, right?

43:07.837 --> 43:10.006
- Don't worry,
I'm not gonna turn you in.

43:14.678 --> 43:17.430
I have a proposition for you.

43:17.472 --> 43:24.604
* *

44:27.792 --> 44:29.878
both:
Nice shot, Dad!
