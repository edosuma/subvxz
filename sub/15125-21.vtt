00:01.735 --> 00:03.704
JIMMY:
My parents had a rule

00:03.737 --> 00:05.806
that if either one of them
ever came into some unexpected
cash,

00:05.839 --> 00:08.209
they bought
the other one a gift.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
And they'd been
doing it a long time.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.912
I put on one of
Paw Paw's old coats

00:11.945 --> 00:13.347
and there was ten
bucks in the pocket.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.882
I paid extra for the
guy behind the counter

00:14.915 --> 00:16.150
to solve it
for you.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.153
Everyone's gonna
think I'm a genius.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.322
They were drug-testing
all the guys buying mulch.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.191
Three different guys gave
me ten bucks for my pee.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.825
The war on drugs
is really working.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.094
Yes!
Mm-hmm.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.361
Bubble wrap!

00:27.395 --> 00:28.896
Now I can do that
neck cracking thing.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.031
(bubbles popping)
Ow.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.032
(groans)

00:32.066 --> 00:33.767
Some guy gave me ten dollars

00:33.801 --> 00:36.104
just to drive his car across
town and not look in the trunk.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.139
(gasps)
Fixes everything.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.510
I was at the mall
and got paid 20 bucks
to go into a room

00:42.543 --> 00:44.512
and decide what was going
to be on NBC next season.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.414
A banana
hammock!

00:46.447 --> 00:47.881
This is great.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.350
Now we have somewhere
for the bananas to sleep

00:49.383 --> 00:50.551
so they won't
feel judged

00:50.584 --> 00:51.685
by all the
other fruit

00:51.719 --> 00:53.521
for their
irregular shape.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.689
JIMMY:
When my mom got promoted
at Knock Knock Knock,

00:55.723 --> 00:58.359
her raise was the biggest
"found money" of her life.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.960
Okay, Maw Maw.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.563
Tell him what
he's won!

01:02.596 --> 01:04.198
It's a pregnant donkey!

01:04.232 --> 01:05.533
No, Maw Maw.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.734
It's a grill!

01:07.735 --> 01:10.037
It's not just
any grill, Burt.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.539
Haven't you seen the
commercial where the pig's

01:11.572 --> 01:12.973
last wish is to be
cooked in one of these?

01:13.006 --> 01:15.143
Pretty sure they pay
the pigs to say that.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.711
Besides, I'm in
more of a soup mood.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.913
Oh, okay.

01:21.014 --> 01:21.982
I liked
this job

01:22.015 --> 01:23.384
a lot better when

01:23.417 --> 01:25.419
I got to sleep with Bob Barker.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.256
Whoo!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.657
* Here we go

01:29.690 --> 01:32.826
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:36.029 --> 01:38.065
Hello, post-sex
ice cream sandwich.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.802
I have earned you
and you will be mine.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.171
Whoa!
Who are you?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.104
Who are you?

01:44.138 --> 01:45.473
Sabrina!

01:45.506 --> 01:47.908
There is a crazy
lady in our house.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.910
What?

01:49.943 --> 01:50.944
Eleanor?

01:50.978 --> 01:51.745
Sabrina.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.613
(laughing)

01:52.646 --> 01:53.914
You know this woman?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.783
(sighs)
Oh, this is my husband Jimmy.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.618
Jimmy, this is Miss Eleanor.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.019
She's Nana's old maid.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.354
Well, not
old maid.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.489
But you're not really
that young,

02:01.522 --> 02:02.790
and you didn't ever marry...

02:02.823 --> 02:03.924
That's enough, dear.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.559
I haven't seen you in forever.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.761
What are you doing here?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.197
ELEANOR:
I was in the hospital

02:09.230 --> 02:11.165
getting my hips, knees
and elbows replaced.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.601
But now I am spry as a kangaroo

02:13.634 --> 02:16.370
and ready to get back working
for your grandmother.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.971
My grandmother?

02:18.005 --> 02:19.540
Her door was closed.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.042
I assume she's sleeping off
her breakfast cocktail?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.711
Oh, she's sleeping
all right.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.313
Very soundly.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.480
(timer dings)

02:26.514 --> 02:27.548
Oh, my scones are done.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.549
(quietly):
Come on.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.351
Come on...

02:30.384 --> 02:31.819
She doesn't know Nana's dead.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.853
What should I do?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.355
Well, just say what you said

02:34.388 --> 02:36.290
to her-her gardener,
her butler and her jester:

02:36.324 --> 02:38.992
"Nana's dead...
we can't afford you now."

02:39.026 --> 02:40.461
But that wasn't her jester.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.895
That was her violent,
alcoholic dog walker.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.364
She just put those
little bells on his hat

02:43.397 --> 02:45.065
so she would know
when he was coming.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.335
But you're right. There's
nothing better than the truth.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.703
Except for
Eleanor's

02:49.737 --> 02:52.973
double chocolate
triple berry nut scones.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.210
And don't forget
my handmade whipped cream.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.078
Oh, mmm.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.247
Mmm...

03:00.047 --> 03:01.849
Eleanor...

03:01.882 --> 03:03.351
there's something
I have to tell you.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.454
Nana's on vacation in Peru.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.055
Say no more.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.156
I understand completely.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.724
Toot toot.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.093
Well...

03:16.297 --> 03:19.166
Burt... why aren't you
using the new grill?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.701
'Cause I love
this old one.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.336
It has been seasoned.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.572
Gives everything that great
hickory chrome flavor.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.240
Plus one lucky
person's burger

03:26.274 --> 03:28.376
gets branded with the words:
"Please return cart."

03:28.409 --> 03:30.344
Oh, forgot
my matches.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.846
Oh, my gosh...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.548
the Burn Master Pro Series.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.250
Their slogan
used to be,

03:36.284 --> 03:38.218
"Lights so easy, a
child could do it."

03:38.252 --> 03:40.588
I wonder why they
changed that.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.256
Yeah, why aren't we cooking
on this baby?

03:42.290 --> 03:43.691
Half my day
is spent

03:43.724 --> 03:45.559
chiseling boogers
off shopping carts.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.695
I don't really
want to eat food
cooked on one.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.297
I know, it's weird.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.964
I got a raise,
so I bought Burt

03:50.998 --> 03:53.066
this fancy new grill,
and he won't even touch it.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.035
You bought it for him.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.106
Well, that explains why
we're eating booger burgers.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.741
Yeah, Virginia.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.276
A man's grill is his connection

04:02.310 --> 04:03.644
to his primal beginnings.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.146
It's a true extension
of his manhood.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.048
He means it's
like his wiener.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.082
Exactly.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.584
You basically just wheeled in

04:10.618 --> 04:12.586
a bigger, more powerful wiener

04:12.620 --> 04:14.322
and put it right
in his backyard.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.590
And if I know Burt,
he's not the kind of guy

04:16.624 --> 04:17.958
who likes a big,
powerful wiener

04:17.991 --> 04:20.227
shoved into
his backyard.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.295
That's ridiculous.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.464
Burt does not think that way.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.100
Hey, Burt, before
you light that,

04:27.134 --> 04:29.269
are you sure you won't even
try the new grill?

04:29.303 --> 04:30.270
Yeah.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.739
I love this little guy.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.441
It leans to the left

04:33.474 --> 04:35.275
and it takes a little longer
to heat up than it used to,

04:35.309 --> 04:36.810
but once I get cooking,

04:36.844 --> 04:38.812
nobody's left unsatisfied.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.361
VIRGINIA:
Burt?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.195
What's this giant present?

04:55.228 --> 04:57.398
I bought it for you!

04:58.499 --> 04:59.467
Found money!

04:59.500 --> 05:02.035
Oh, man,
this is amazing!

05:02.069 --> 05:03.971
Oh...

05:04.004 --> 05:05.305
How much money did you find?

05:05.339 --> 05:06.607
$320,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.175
tucked away in
a heater vent.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.010
I thought Paw Paw
must've put it in there,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.479
but when I asked Maw Maw about
it, she said "Who's Paw Paw?"

05:11.512 --> 05:12.546
So I think we're good.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.648
Burt, I put that money in there.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.117
Wait a minute.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.619
If you found money,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.821
you were supposed
to buy me a gift.

05:20.854 --> 05:21.955
Does that mean I get the chair?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.323
No, Burt...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.195
(sighs)
I didn't find the money.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.330
I got a raise

05:30.364 --> 05:31.799
and I've been hiding the cash

05:31.832 --> 05:33.133
'cause I didn't want you
to see it and feel bad.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.868
Why would I feel bad?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.905
Because I make
more money than you?
I don't care about that.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.708
Well, then why won't you use the
fancy new grill I bought you?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.009
Because the shopping cart
has years

05:42.042 --> 05:43.377
of seasoning caked
right into it.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.712
I love cooking on that thing.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.980
You're not feeling demasculated?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.382
You kidding? I'm proud of you.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.950
How much are you making anyway?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.521
Here's my last pay stub.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.489
There's a comma in this.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.725
We've never made comma money.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.826
Are you upset?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.828
Upset? I'm retiring.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.830
I'm out, baby!

06:02.863 --> 06:03.831
I'm not going
to work today,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.365
tomorrow or ever.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.068
I'm gonna call my boss
and tell him to screw himself.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.970
And since I'm my boss,
I just did!

06:13.874 --> 06:15.443
So what's your plan for today?

06:15.476 --> 06:18.746
Oh, I got a lot of
things I want to get to.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.948
First thing, I want to
watch that little bird

06:20.981 --> 06:22.182
come out of that clock.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.018
(rhythmic creaking)

06:25.052 --> 06:26.186
That's not a cuckoo clock.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.922
We'll see.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.758
Are you sure
you want to quit your job?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.960
Well, after expenses,
I barely broke even anyway.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.028
It's more of a hobby
than a job.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.130
And I always said, when
my business made it big,

06:37.164 --> 06:39.266
you could quit being a maid
and follow your passion.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.234
Well, since you're the
one who made it big...

06:41.268 --> 06:42.803
You want to follow
your passion.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.706
Heck, yeah.
So, what is your passion?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.708
My passion is fashion.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.610
Wait, no.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.845
I just heard Tim Gunn say that.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.848
I guess I don't have one.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.885
(rhythmic creaking)

06:57.918 --> 06:59.887
Sabrina, we've got
to tell Eleanor

06:59.920 --> 07:01.989
that we can't
afford to pay her.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.391
But, Jimmy,
did you feel how soft

07:04.424 --> 07:06.259
those towels were
in the bathroom?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.562
It was like drying your face
with a kitten.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.431
So, we'll rescue a kitten
for you to rub your face on.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.600
Eleanor?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.934
Oh. Excuse me.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.569
Uh, we need to
talk to you.
Just let me

07:15.603 --> 07:16.837
give you your tea first.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.305
Here's chamomile with one sugar

07:18.338 --> 07:19.807
for you, and

07:19.840 --> 07:22.843
for the master of the house,
chilled grape soda.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.177
Mm-hmm.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.412
Listen, Eleanor...

07:25.445 --> 07:27.280
My God, this grape
soda is good.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.749
Oh, thank you.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.619
I went all the way
to the bad part of town for it.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.087
That's nice.
And also, Nana's dead.

07:34.121 --> 07:34.955
Yeah.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.423
She's dead?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.625
Oh.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.092
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

07:39.126 --> 07:39.993
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.529
Do I still get my money?

07:41.562 --> 07:42.663
What money?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.931
From the trust
that Nana set up

07:43.964 --> 07:45.533
so that I could
always work here?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.134
Wait a second.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.869
So we don't have

07:48.902 --> 07:50.504
to pay you a dime, and you'll
keep kitten-ing up our towels?

07:50.538 --> 07:52.172
That's correct. Now,

07:52.205 --> 07:54.542
would you like a straw
for your grape soda?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.677
I think it's what
Nana would have wanted.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
Yes.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.848
Ah!

08:02.049 --> 08:03.551
JIMMY:
With so much time on his hands,

08:03.584 --> 08:07.287
my dad made finding his passion
a full-time job.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.489
(popping)

08:10.591 --> 08:12.292
The Chinese are finally
coming ashore,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.327
looking for the money
we owe them.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.066
So I can't have sex
and I have to shave my head.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.068
I'm sorry.
I thought I was going

08:21.101 --> 08:23.470
to be solving crimes
with a germaphobic dude.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.173
(laughter)

08:31.111 --> 08:33.080
Oh, my God!

08:33.113 --> 08:34.381
That is amazing!

08:34.414 --> 08:35.749
I know,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.718
but while I was carving it,
I felt nothing.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.052
This isn't my passion,

08:39.086 --> 08:40.654
just something I'm
incredibly good at.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.189
(thudding)
What's for lunch?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.691
(slurping
through straw)

08:48.095 --> 08:50.731
(whistling)

08:53.033 --> 08:56.536
(squawking)

08:56.570 --> 08:57.871
Guess I'm no good at this.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.079
(chirping)

09:06.113 --> 09:07.280
(screeches)

09:08.115 --> 09:09.950
What?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.920
Burt, wake up.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.521
What happened?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.523
I couldn't find my passion.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.592
I tried all day, and nothing.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.028
It feels like it shouldn't
take you a long time

09:21.061 --> 09:22.562
to figure out your passion.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.698
It took me a long time
to figure out my passion.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.934
Well, maybe you just need
to keep looking.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.702
But my wife told me
to keep looking.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.803
I mean, maybe you...

09:29.837 --> 09:30.804
Shh. I think the TV's trying

09:30.838 --> 09:32.039
to tell me something.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.540
Turns out my passion

09:33.573 --> 09:36.409
was justice, justice, justice.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.513
NARRATOR: The only show shot
entirely in Mullet Vision.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.619
(Taser clicking, man sputtering)

09:45.653 --> 09:48.121
Mullet...

09:48.155 --> 09:50.423
Oh, my God,
that looks perfect for me!

09:50.457 --> 09:52.092
You want to be a bounty hunter?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.127
No, I meant growing a mullet
and running in slow motion,

09:54.161 --> 09:55.328
but that's even better.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.897
You really get me, Virginia.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.833
I have found my passion.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.202
Burt Chance: Bounty Hunter.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.985
Are you going to be
a bounty hunter,

10:18.018 --> 10:20.020
or fight the robbers
from Home Alone?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.289
I have to be prepared
for anything.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.291
I've even got a baseball cap,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.593
princess hat, and a sombrero

10:26.626 --> 10:28.495
so I can blend in anywhere,
or at least

10:28.528 --> 10:30.664
at a ballgame,
a castle or Mexico.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.767
Babe, this whole thing
seems really dangerous.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.670
Look, I got a list
of Natesville's bail-skippers.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.371
None of them
are very dangerous.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.373
This guy's got a bunch
of outstanding parking tickets

10:40.407 --> 10:41.942
for one
of those wimpy motorcycles

10:41.975 --> 10:43.543
with two wheels in the front.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.013
Burt, fat guys with ponytails
can be dangerous, too.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.681
Virginia, I love you,
but don't worry.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.116
I promise to be safe.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.550
And as soon
as I've collared enough perps,

10:50.583 --> 10:51.985
I'm gonna buy
a bulletproof vest.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.186
And until then,

10:53.220 --> 10:56.023
I'll be protected
by this fishing vest

10:56.056 --> 10:58.225
full of flasks and bibles.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.864
Eleanor, can you keep
down the dusting?

11:03.897 --> 11:06.066
We're trying to watch
Hiking with the Stars.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.068
SABRINA:
Oh, I know. I can hardly

11:08.101 --> 11:11.404
hear Paula Deen sucking
the venom out of Coolio's leg.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.406
My hair's never been cleaner

11:13.440 --> 11:15.508
since you came
into my life, Eleanor.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.644
Not hard to believe, sir.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.312
Hey, Eleanor?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.081
Do you mind
cotton-swabbing my ears?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.884
Sometimes I get excited,
and I go too deep too fast.

11:40.901 --> 11:41.869
Nate Henson?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.037
Burt Chance, bounty hunter.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.705
You're coming with me,
come here.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.207
No, you big jerk, I'm Phil!

11:47.240 --> 11:48.876
Nate's my identical
twin brother!

11:48.909 --> 11:50.410
Ah, please, nice try.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.012
Even though you were arrested
for shoplifting,

11:52.045 --> 11:53.914
the real crime's the murder
of these innocent plants

11:53.947 --> 11:55.048
on this property.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.950
Even the weeds are dead.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.552
Phil, uh,

11:59.586 --> 12:00.620
what's going on, man?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.522
Nate? Nate Henson?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.057
Bail-skipping shoplifter?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.726
Aw, crap.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.762
No hard feelings, Phil.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.798
Now...

12:10.831 --> 12:13.366
who's next after Nate Henson?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.335
Phil Henson.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.539
Damn it.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.041
(knocking)

12:21.074 --> 12:23.743
Mabel Harrington. Open up.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.614
I've got a comically oversized
check for you and some balloons.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.616
What's going on?

12:29.649 --> 12:31.151
I'm-I'm so confused.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.752
Well, you weren't confused
when you skipped bail

12:32.786 --> 12:35.088
on $5,000 worth
of parking tickets.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.890
Oh, dear. There must be

12:36.924 --> 12:38.558
a misunderstanding.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.627
I'm feeling a little faint.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.964
Taste pepper spray, copper!

12:43.997 --> 12:45.465
(chuckles)
Nice try.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.167
That's just
cinnamon breath spray.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.101
(chuckles)

12:49.436 --> 12:52.806
(screams)
Turns out cinnamon burns.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.008
Good.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.512
Burt Chance, bounty hunter.

13:02.883 --> 13:07.054
Oh, I did not think this
through.

13:08.221 --> 13:11.458
Do you prefer
a right or a left hang?

13:12.893 --> 13:15.963
My dentist is going to be
so happy we got a maid.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.865
Mmm.
(door opens)

13:17.898 --> 13:20.033
You guys,

13:20.067 --> 13:22.135
I need your help.
Your father...

13:23.003 --> 13:24.137
The hell is going on here?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.172
What does it look like?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.106
We're getting our teeth flossed.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.942
We're maid people now.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.178
As a member of the domestic
service community,

13:31.211 --> 13:34.447
normally right now I'd be
giving you a long talking-to

13:34.481 --> 13:36.116
about abusing your maid,
but your father

13:36.149 --> 13:37.484
might be dead.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.153
Eleanor, adjust my
face to express shock.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.454
Very good, sir.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.355
Allow me.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.323
(moans)
Your father

13:43.356 --> 13:44.324
is following his dream

13:44.357 --> 13:45.492
to become a bounty hunter.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.726
But I'm really
worried because

13:46.759 --> 13:47.895
I've called him 37 times

13:47.928 --> 13:49.296
and he hasn't answered
his phone,

13:49.329 --> 13:51.131
so I need you
to help me

13:51.164 --> 13:53.533
get on the computer and do that
thing where you find his phone.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.568
No problem. That's exactly
how I rescued Jimmy

13:55.602 --> 13:57.871
when he got stuck in
that parking garage in the mall.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.941
I was chasing a balloon.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.649
BURT:
Virginia?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.851
Burt?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.154
What are you doing here?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.889
You haven't been answering
your phone,

14:15.923 --> 14:17.390
and I've been worried sick.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.359
I turned it off.
I can't get the jump on a skip

14:19.392 --> 14:21.895
with my cell phone
on blast... man.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.231
I'll admit it.
It's pretty damn sexy

14:24.264 --> 14:25.899
when you talk
like a bounty hunter,

14:25.933 --> 14:27.901
but it's too stressful for
me to have you out here

14:27.935 --> 14:30.003
on the streets. I want
you to come home.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.538
This is my passion.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.406
Hunting bounties is what
I was put on Earth to do.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.608
Asking me to stop
is like asking Fleetwood Mac

14:35.642 --> 14:37.777
to stop thinking about tomorrow.
He'll never do it.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.346
Okay.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.382
When you put it like that,
I can't ask you to stop,

14:42.415 --> 14:46.253
but I can't sit at home
worrying about you either. So...

14:46.286 --> 14:48.588
if this really is your passion,

14:48.621 --> 14:50.123
we should do it together.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.691
Well, I really could use
a partner.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.927
Damn it. I should have built
a bigger box.

14:53.961 --> 14:54.962
So who we staking out?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.263
It's my biggest payday yet.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.464
The Big Kahuna.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.966
Really? What's his name?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.533
The Big Kahuna.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.236
MAN:
Would you two
amateurs shut up?

15:03.270 --> 15:05.372
You're gonna spook
the skip. Shh!

15:05.405 --> 15:08.641
Mullet! I've seen all
your shows. I'm a huge fan.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.211
Let me guess. Burt Chance?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.479
How'd you know
who I am?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.947
I've been hearing
about you all day.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.782
I can't have you moving
in on my territory.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.985
I got a mortgage, I got two kids
in private school,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.386
a woman who wants
new countertops.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.553
You got to quit it, brother.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.089
No way. This is
my destiny, man.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.391
Yeah, so step
off, Achy Breaky.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.093
Mullet don't care
about no destiny.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.260
This skip is mine.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.495
You understand?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.696
(shattering)

15:30.830 --> 15:32.165
(grunting)

15:32.199 --> 15:33.666
(car alarm blaring)

15:33.700 --> 15:34.767
(panting)

15:34.801 --> 15:35.835
We got a runner!

15:35.868 --> 15:37.137
Run, Burt!
(grunts)

15:37.170 --> 15:39.506
Run!
(grunting)

15:51.351 --> 15:53.520
(grunts, panting)

15:57.390 --> 16:00.093
Hey!

16:00.127 --> 16:01.961
This plant's a wandering Jew!

16:01.995 --> 16:04.964
I'm pretty sure that makes this
a hate crime!

16:04.998 --> 16:07.867
(Mullet yells)

16:24.251 --> 16:25.385
WOMAN:
What's going on?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.387
(sighs)
It's a long story.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.059
Oh, Dowager Countess.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.494
You are salacious.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.364
Thank you, Master Bates.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.467
(panting)

16:40.500 --> 16:42.469
Why, what in heaven's name?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.403
(panting)

16:43.436 --> 16:45.238
(grunting)

16:45.272 --> 16:47.140
Sorry, buddy!

16:47.174 --> 16:48.641
Oh!

16:48.675 --> 16:50.577
(grunting)

16:50.610 --> 16:51.711
Sweet hair!

16:51.744 --> 16:53.046
Thanks, dude!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.181
Big fan!

17:01.788 --> 17:04.057
Crap!

17:04.091 --> 17:05.692
Look out! Turkey!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.599
Barney, stop him!

17:12.632 --> 17:14.601
I'd love to, but I've been
working on this pyramid

17:14.634 --> 17:16.836
of paper towels
for over six hours.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.937
MULLET:
Whoa!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.506
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
(laughs)

17:19.539 --> 17:21.774
Ah.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.111
Come on.

17:27.947 --> 17:33.553
We've got quite a spillage of
tea in the break room, Barnard.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.593
MAN (over P.A.):
Cleanup in Aisle 1.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.196
(Sabrina sighs)

17:43.230 --> 17:45.698
Jimmy,

17:45.732 --> 17:47.200
why are you folding
the laundry

17:47.234 --> 17:49.035
when we have somebody
to do that for us now?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.803
I was thinking
about what my mom said

17:50.837 --> 17:52.972
about abusing
our maid, and...

17:53.005 --> 17:56.109
I think our behavior
is starting to rub off on Hope.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.577
SABRINA (groans):
Look,

17:57.610 --> 17:58.645
your mom is just jealous

17:58.678 --> 18:00.413
because Eleanor
is a house maid

18:00.447 --> 18:02.815
and your mom's just
a regular maid for hire.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.253
Mmm. There.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.987
No crust, dummy!

18:08.020 --> 18:10.056
Oh, no!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.324
Oh, my God, we got
to get rid of her.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.526
Eleanor, not
Hope, right?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.629
Well, thanks to you,
we lost him.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.065
Me? I'm
the professional.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.335
You amateurs cornered
a dangerous criminal

18:22.369 --> 18:23.970
in a public space.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.072
I wouldn't call him dangerous.
He's a graffiti artist.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.275
"Artist" is a loose term.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.877
He draws penises
on stop signs.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.749
Come on down, Kahuna.
You're not gonna get away.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.186
Never! And if you try
to climb this tree,

18:39.219 --> 18:41.188
I'll paint a penis on it
with indelible marker!

18:41.221 --> 18:42.855
Well, I hope
that marker's fireproof

18:42.889 --> 18:44.991
'cause I got a flamethrower
in my truck

18:45.024 --> 18:46.859
with this stupid tree's name
on it!

18:46.893 --> 18:48.328
Stupid tree?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.197
This is the oldest
Eldanica pine in Natesville.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.032
Who cares?
I do. I watched this tree
grow up my whole life.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.701
I'm not gonna
let you hurt it.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.369
I don't give a crap
about some stupid tree.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.605
I'm all about the bounty.
That's who I am.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.972
Who are you,
some sort

19:00.006 --> 19:01.208
of tree humper?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.276
I believe the phrase
is "tree hugger."

19:03.310 --> 19:05.945
And if caring about a
tree more than some stupid
bounty makes me one,

19:05.978 --> 19:06.779
then maybe I am.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.149
Come here, big guy!

19:10.183 --> 19:12.785
Burt...

19:12.819 --> 19:14.621
I don't think you wanted
to retire

19:14.654 --> 19:16.122
as much as you thought
you did.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.458
I think you're right.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.460
Landscaping is my passion.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.694
Just like my passion,

19:21.728 --> 19:23.896
drawing ding-dongs on stuff.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.166
Mullet...

19:27.200 --> 19:29.336
you'll burn down this
tree over my dead body.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.070
I wasn't really
gonna burn the tree.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.805
I just needed something big
before the commercial break.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.407
Well, how you
gonna get him down?

19:34.441 --> 19:35.742
Tase time.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.747
(clicking)
(shouts)

19:41.381 --> 19:43.516
(sputtering)

19:45.685 --> 19:47.654
JIMMY:
Eleanor,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.256
we need to talk to you.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.825
I know my nana promised you
a job for life here,

19:52.859 --> 19:54.193
and-and it's really
just that...

19:54.227 --> 19:55.862
we don't want Hope
to grow up in a house

19:55.895 --> 19:57.830
where somebody does everything
for her.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.600
I'm really sorry, but I think
we're gonna have to let you go.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.402
So you're firing me?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.003
That's a strong word.
Uh, really,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.605
we're just giving you
an opportunity...

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
Oh, thank God.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.109
I thought the only way
I was gonna get out of this

20:10.142 --> 20:13.846
was if your cute family died
in an unfortunate accident

20:13.880 --> 20:15.615
or if someone was dropping

20:15.648 --> 20:19.085
tiny drops of-of arsenic
into your scones!

20:19.118 --> 20:20.520
You didn't.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.955
Well, of course not,
but everyone daydreams.

20:22.989 --> 20:27.260
Well, you'll have to
forward my mail to Jamaica!

20:27.294 --> 20:30.797
I'll be getting
my groove back!

20:30.830 --> 20:33.466
Yay!
(laughs)

20:33.500 --> 20:35.568
She took that better
than I thought.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.706
You smell that, Virginia?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.742
You really love
that old grill, don't you?

20:42.775 --> 20:45.478
I do. Each burger's infused
with the memory smell

20:45.512 --> 20:47.480
of 100 burgers before it.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.381
(inhales deeply)

20:48.415 --> 20:50.283
Labor Day 2001.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.919
And you're sure you're not upset
that I make more than you?

20:52.952 --> 20:56.389
Of course not. I love what I do
and I love watching you succeed.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.157
Mom makes more than you?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.659
It's not that big
of a deal.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.060
I make more than you do
and you don't care.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.129
What? You make
more than me?

21:03.162 --> 21:04.597
She makes more than me?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.599
So, um, uh,
h-how 'bout that grill, Burt?

21:06.633 --> 21:07.900
U-Uh, if you're not
using it,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.168
I'll take it
off your hands.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.437
Oh, of course.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.739
The guy who owns a
bed and a sofa.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.641
Now you get
a free grill.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.009
The rich get richer.
VIRGINIA:
Sorry, guys.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.745
We're still using this one.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.347
Makes the perfect
herb garden.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.484
Thanks, buddy.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.619
(boat horn honks)

21:26.653 --> 21:28.521
MAN:
Shirts and pants.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.123
