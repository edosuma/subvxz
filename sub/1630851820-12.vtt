10:38.079 --> 10:41.617
Yeah. You don’t want to wind up
like Ouchy Paws.

10:41.617 --> 10:44.046
Ouchy Paws? Who’s that?

10:44.046 --> 10:47.046
Only a ghost pup.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.244
Ooh.
\h\h\h\h\h\hA ghost pup?

10:48.244 --> 10:50.211
A ghost pup.
\h\h\hTell us more, dude.

10:50.211 --> 10:53.046
Um, you don’t have to,
Danny.

10:53.046 --> 10:53.980
Come on, Rubble.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.244
It’s just a story about
a ghost named Ouchy Paws

10:56.244 --> 10:58.409
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwho haunts
the prickle-berry bushes.

10:58.409 --> 10:59.683
PUPS:
\hOoh.

10:59.683 --> 11:03.749
\h\h\hHe walks on tiptoes
and howls in the darkness.

11:03.749 --> 11:05.376
(Howling)

11:05.376 --> 11:06.013
Oh.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.376
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h’Cause he, like,
stepped on the sharp prickles.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.376
And if he catches you,

11:09.376 --> 11:14.650
he gives you ouchy paws, too,
\h\h\h\h\h\hso you go, "Ouch!"

11:14.650 --> 11:16.376
(Gasping, giggling)

11:16.376 --> 11:18.848
That’s a really silly story,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDanny.

11:18.848 --> 11:21.211
\h\h\hYeah. So funny.
(Chuckling nervously)

11:21.211 --> 11:24.782
Yeah. Us extreme stunt guys
\h\h\h\h\h\hlike to tell it

11:24.782 --> 11:25.683
to scare each other.

11:25.683 --> 11:30.343
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIt’s okay, Rubble.
There’s nothing scary out there.

11:35.716 --> 11:38.947
\h\h\hThat "Ouchy Paws"
sure was a scary story.

11:38.947 --> 11:41.079
Huh, Cap’n boss, Mr. Sid, sir?

11:41.079 --> 11:43.914
Aye. Almost as scary
\has trying to find

11:43.914 --> 11:46.046
\h\h\h\h\hmy buried treasure
in the middle of the desert.

11:46.046 --> 11:48.749
Um, sir? I think you buried
\h\h\hit on a desert island.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.815
Not the desert.

11:51.815 --> 11:55.178
Oh. Yeah. Argh!

11:55.178 --> 11:56.914
(Gasping)

11:58.145 --> 11:59.277
Change of plans, Arrby.

11:59.277 --> 12:03.881
Forget the treasure. I need,
need, need that skateboard!

12:03.881 --> 12:06.079
That skateboard would be
\h\h\h\h\h\h\ha step up

12:06.079 --> 12:08.145
from the tricycle you borrowed.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.145
And I won’t have to pedal it.

12:11.145 --> 12:12.145
But how do we
borrow it

12:12.145 --> 12:14.409
when they’re sleeping
right next to it?

12:14.409 --> 12:16.475
Methinks we’ll scare them away

12:16.475 --> 12:19.343
with a little help
\hfrom Ouchy Paws.

12:19.343 --> 12:21.376
Ouchy Paws? Where?

12:21.376 --> 12:24.244
\h\h\h\h\hOh. You mean
we’re going to pretend

12:24.244 --> 12:25.244
to be ghosts.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.409
\h\h\h\h\hAye, Arrby.
Or should I say Ouchy?

12:29.409 --> 12:31.046
(Both cackling)

12:31.046 --> 12:36.244
(Someone howling
in the distance)

12:36.244 --> 12:38.046
What’s that noise?

12:38.046 --> 12:38.947
It’s Ouchy Paws.

12:38.947 --> 12:42.244
Danny’s made-up story
wasn’t made up at all.

12:42.244 --> 12:44.815
\h\h\hEasy, Rubble.
I’m sure it’s not--

12:44.815 --> 12:47.013
(Howling continues)

12:47.013 --> 12:49.211
Rubble is right.
It’s Ouchy Paws.

12:49.211 --> 12:51.815
Now, let’s make ghost-y shadows.

12:51.815 --> 12:55.947
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(Howling)

12:56.980 --> 12:58.211
Ouchy Paws is coming.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.881
(Howling continues)

12:59.881 --> 13:03.178
And he’s brought a friend!
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(Screaming)

13:05.046 --> 13:07.013
Hey. What’s going on out there?

13:07.013 --> 13:09.442
Careful of the prickle-berries.

13:09.442 --> 13:10.277
It worked! Arr.

13:10.277 --> 13:12.881
\h\h\hLet’s grab
that skateboard.

13:16.013 --> 13:17.881
Sit close, Danny.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.848
Hey. Where is Danny?

13:19.848 --> 13:22.013
There goes his skateboard.

13:22.013 --> 13:23.145
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDanny.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hStop.
Come back.

13:23.145 --> 13:26.310
He’s going to skate right into
\h\h\h\h\h\hHalf-Pipe Canyon.

13:26.310 --> 13:27.244
In the dark.

13:27.244 --> 13:28.310
We’ve got to rescue him.

13:28.310 --> 13:32.376
No Danny is too daring.
\h\hNo pup is too small.

13:32.815 --> 13:36.310
\h\h\h\h\hPAW Patrol,
to the PAW Patroller.

13:36.310 --> 13:39.244
\h\h\h\h\hPUPS:
Ryder needs us.

13:39.244 --> 13:42.046
Whoa. What’s that?

13:42.046 --> 13:42.947
(Barking)

13:42.947 --> 13:44.409
Marshall, watch out.

13:44.409 --> 13:46.277
\h\hWhoa!
(Thudding)

13:46.277 --> 13:51.848
Don’t worry. I’m not Ouchy Paws,
but I am Ouchy Nose.

13:51.848 --> 13:53.244
Ouch.

13:53.244 --> 13:56.013
(Everyone laughing)

14:00.310 --> 14:04.211
(Giggling)

14:05.244 --> 14:08.848
PAW Patrol ready for action,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hRyder, sir.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.442
Thanks for hurrying,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hpups.

14:10.442 --> 14:14.584
We have to stop Daring Danny
\h\h\h\h\hbefore he gets hurt

14:14.584 --> 14:16.112
in Half-Pipe Canyon.
\h<i>\hWhoa!</i>

14:16.112 --> 14:18.617
So, for this mission,
\h\h\hI’ll need Skye.

14:18.617 --> 14:22.244
I need you to use your light
to find Danny in the canyon.

14:22.244 --> 14:24.947
This puppy has got to fly.

14:24.947 --> 14:25.617
And Chase.

14:25.617 --> 14:28.343
I need you to use your net
\h\h\h\h\h\hto stop Danny

14:28.343 --> 14:30.145
on those twisty trails.

14:30.145 --> 14:31.881
Chase is on the case.

14:31.881 --> 14:35.046
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAll right.
