WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:05.005
MAN: Tonight, look upon the evl

00:05.135 --> 00:07.137
that you did.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.967
ANNOUNCER: A Christmas Carol premieres December 19 at 7:30 on FX.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.579
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.710 --> 00:17.191
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.243
Goddamn it.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.724
Come on, get in there!

00:28.854 --> 00:30.117
Charlie, what are you doing,
man? What are you--

00:30.247 --> 00:31.466
-What's going on over here?
-Oh, I'm trying to get

00:31.596 --> 00:32.902
each of my toes

00:33.033 --> 00:34.077
in these five-fingered shoes,
you know what I mean?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.513
But there's, like,
something's dropping off

00:35.644 --> 00:37.080
and I can't tell
where my pinky is.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.690
Why did you get the stupid
five-finger shoes?

00:38.821 --> 00:39.735
Well, you're always
yelling at me

00:39.865 --> 00:41.171
for taking my shoes off
in laser tag,

00:41.215 --> 00:42.520
so I figured I'd get some shoes

00:42.651 --> 00:44.218
that are like--
a lot more like bare feet.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.741
-I don't know why you're alwaysyelling at me about...
-Well, I'm always

00:45.871 --> 00:47.569
yelling at you because when
you're taking your shoes off,

00:47.612 --> 00:48.744
you're not holding your gun.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.441
And also, you know,
the cheese you've eaten,

00:50.485 --> 00:52.226
it-it's always oozing
out of your feet

00:52.269 --> 00:53.140
and it's an awful smell.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.011
That's the cheese
I hide in my shoes,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.273
-that's where it is.
-Okay, well-- What?

00:56.404 --> 00:58.058
I can't even, like,
fit cheese in these shoes.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.059
These things suck.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.364
Just guard the base, man.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.105
Kind of sick and tired
of guarding the base.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.628
What if we go out there,
run around?

01:03.759 --> 01:05.065
I want to go out there
and have some fun, man.

01:05.194 --> 01:07.328
We gotta guard the base.
That's what we always do,

01:07.371 --> 01:09.634
and that's what we figured out
works a long time ago.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.158
Plus, we're-we're waiting
for Big Mo.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.943
Waiting for who?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.118
We're waiting for Big Mo, man.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.859
The-the hotshot kid and his crew

01:16.989 --> 01:18.208
that are climbing up
the leaderboard.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.644
Yeah, he's gonna be gunning
for our base

01:19.775 --> 01:21.211
and we need to protect it.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.343
Ah, who gives a shit, man?
There's always

01:22.386 --> 01:24.258
some hotshot kid
gunning for our base.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.346
Look, Charlie.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.130
How long we been playing
laser tag?

01:27.174 --> 01:29.567
-A long time.
-A long time, baby. Yeah.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.178
Some people might thinkthat's sad, but that's not sad.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.831
-I think-- I think it's awesome.
-That's not sad, that's cool.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.746
I think the longeryou're in the game, the better,

01:34.877 --> 01:36.008
-you know what I mean?
-Yes, yeah, no, definitely.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.880
Look. We're the best,
we're-we're awesome,

01:38.010 --> 01:40.100
but, um, I'm-I'm done.
I'm moving on.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.753
-I'm...
-No, no, no, no, no!
No, stop. Stay.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.364
We're playing the game
the way we always play it,

01:43.407 --> 01:44.365
and we're...

01:44.408 --> 01:47.019
waiting for Big Mo.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.267
DENNIS:
All right.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.877
Everything's going to plan
out there.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.052
Yeah, but it does sound like

02:20.096 --> 02:21.228
people are out there having fun,
you know?

02:21.358 --> 02:22.403
-What's with you today, man?
-I don't know.

02:22.533 --> 02:23.926
I'm bored. I want to do
something different.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.233
What about, uh,
what if we do some riddles?

02:26.276 --> 02:27.364
-Riddles?
-Yeah.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.844
Frank and I have been doing
a lot of riddles

02:28.887 --> 02:30.454
to kill the time,
you know what I mean?

02:30.498 --> 02:31.281
It's... I think

02:31.412 --> 02:32.674
we'll have a little bit
more fun that way.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.284
No. I'm just gonna
guard the base.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.285
Yeah, I know, but here it comes.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.418
Why do blind people
hate skydiving?

02:37.548 --> 02:39.289
I don't even understand
how that's a riddle.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.291
Well, 'cause
it's a-a very hard one, okay?

02:41.422 --> 02:43.337
-So try-- take a guess.
-I don't know. Why?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.122
'Cause it scares the hell
out of their dogs.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.689
That's not a riddle.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.430
Yeah, it's a riddle
about blind people, you know?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.127
-No.
-And-and their dogs, I guess.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.346
No, what you've told me
is a joke.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.086
No. Jokes are funny
and that wasn't funny.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.349
I didn't say it was funny.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.480
-Then how is it a joke, Dennis?-

02:56.611 --> 02:57.612
Um-- Okay, you know what?
Yeah.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.309
No, that was
a mind-bending riddle.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.484
-Wow.
-It's a tough one,
'cause you don't think...

03:00.615 --> 03:02.094
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
-Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.792
-Listen.

03:03.835 --> 03:04.836
That could be Big Mo.
Get ready.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.142
Get ready, here we go.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.144
-MAC: Get off of me!
-DEE: Ah! Get off me!

03:08.275 --> 03:10.277
-Stop it!
-Dennis, everything
was going perfectly.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.887
I was up in the air ducts,
just like you said.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.454
-Oh---I was sniping at the red base.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.499
I was at the blue base
doing the exact same thing.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.239
-What is...?-I tried to crawl down the ducts

03:16.370 --> 03:18.372
and pass this
uncoordinated monkey.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.156
-We go by each other...
-We got tangled up

03:20.287 --> 03:21.244
and then she spit
in my mouth, Dennis.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.854
-She spit in my mouth.
-I spit in your mouth

03:22.898 --> 03:25.161
after you jammed me in the titwith your scrawny little elbow.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.032
My elbows are massive
and you have no tits!

03:27.076 --> 03:28.338
-Your elbows suck!
-Ah. Damn it!

03:28.469 --> 03:29.470
Goddamn it,
can you do nothing right?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.471
This is all your fault.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.907
I've been warning you

03:32.037 --> 03:33.691
about your lack of elbow mass
for weeks.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.215
You idiot! You fool!

03:35.345 --> 03:36.433
And you!

03:38.435 --> 03:39.480
You're doing a great job.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.351
Okay?

03:41.482 --> 03:43.266
You are killing it out there,
and I'm so proud of you!

03:43.397 --> 03:46.182
-Now I need you both to get
back up there and...
-CHARLIE: Wait.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.401
I-I actually got an idea.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.924
Like, what if you guys
don't play the game

03:49.054 --> 03:50.491
up in the air ducts this time,

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
but you go down on the floor?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.233
Where everyone's having
all the fun?

03:53.363 --> 03:54.408
They look like
they're having so much fun

03:54.451 --> 03:55.409
-playing laser ta...
-Will you shut up?!

03:55.452 --> 03:56.671
This isn't about having fun.
Okay?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.673
This is about staying alive
and winning. Okay?

03:58.803 --> 03:59.717
And-and it's also...

03:59.848 --> 04:01.806
it's also about getting these.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.506
Now, Mac...

04:05.549 --> 04:06.942
what are these?

04:06.985 --> 04:08.335
Fun Zone dolla dolla bills,
y'all.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.337
Fun Zone
dolla dolla bills, y'all.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.121
Okay?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.992
I'm trying to get that paper,
son.

04:14.123 --> 04:14.993
All right?

04:15.124 --> 04:16.778
Win, stay alive,

04:16.821 --> 04:18.257
get dat money.

04:18.387 --> 04:19.563
Feel me?

04:19.607 --> 04:20.738
I feel you.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.479
-But those guys are having fun.-DEE: Yeah.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.785
And doing something fun
out there.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.221
-And that's what I want to do.
-DENNIS: Hey, man.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.006
Could I talk to you
for a second, please?

04:28.050 --> 04:30.444
-Yeah. What's up?
-What you doing, man?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.837
Why-why you...
why you mucking things up?

04:32.968 --> 04:34.752
I mean, I got things
down to a science, okay?

04:34.796 --> 04:37.233
-Everything's working.
-DEE: Stop it.
-Ah, ah, ah!

04:37.277 --> 04:39.235
I know, but, like, these guys
are ready to kill each other.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.324
-It's like...
-I know, but that's
what I want, okay?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.544
I need their aggression
at a ten.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.023
That's when
they're most effective.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.242
So I withhold compliments
from Mac,

04:46.373 --> 04:48.331
because that makes him angry
and subservient,

04:48.375 --> 04:49.332
so he'll do
what I tell him to do.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.552
And I shower Dee
with compliments

04:51.595 --> 04:53.510
because she feels so undeservingof compliments

04:53.554 --> 04:54.772
that she gets angry at herself

04:54.816 --> 04:56.774
and she takes that anger
out on the children.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.210
-Oh.
-See?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.342
Okay. It's another riddle.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.387
Let me think on that one,
Dennis,

05:00.517 --> 05:01.605
'cause I don't know
the answer...

05:01.736 --> 05:02.780
Okay. Yeah.
You think on that for a while.

05:02.911 --> 05:03.999
I'm gonna do my thing.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.609
-You stop.
-You stop.
-Goddamn it, Mac,

05:05.740 --> 05:08.003
you thin-elbowed little goblin.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.613
You never cease
to disappoint me

05:09.744 --> 05:10.614
in everything you do.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.833
Now get back up in those ducts

05:11.963 --> 05:14.226
and snipe those
other kids' bases.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.838
And don't come down
until I tell you to. And Dee--

05:16.968 --> 05:18.753
You really are killing it
out there.

05:18.796 --> 05:19.754
I'm so proud of you.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.321
You're so deserving

05:21.451 --> 05:22.757
of my love.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.940
Yeah, see?

05:31.983 --> 05:34.377
We just gotta keep playingthe game the way we always have.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.206
Yeah. Hey, is the answer
to your riddle, uh,

05:37.337 --> 05:38.642
an ice cube?

05:39.991 --> 05:40.949
Yeah.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.385
Yep, you got it.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.517
-That was a hard one.
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.779
Pew, pew.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.084
-Pew.
-DENNIS: Oh.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.522
Pew, pew. Pew, pew.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.611
-Pew, pew. Oh.
-What are you doing, man?

05:50.741 --> 05:51.829
I'm killing it out there.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.440
I haven't been hit once.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.050
It's really a lot of fun.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.008
But I wanted to come
and hang out with you guys.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.575
Hey, hey, Charlie,
you want to do some riddles?

05:58.619 --> 05:59.750
-Yes!
-No, we're not...

05:59.794 --> 06:01.491
-No, that doesn't...
-Yes. Yes, I do, hit me.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.971
Is a fart a ghost?

06:03.014 --> 06:05.626
Is a fart a ghost?
Whoa, that's a hard one.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.757
I don't know. What's the answer?

06:06.801 --> 06:09.064
Yeah. It's the ghost of lunch.
Ha-ha!

06:09.194 --> 06:10.195
-Very good, man!
-Good riddle.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.327
-That's a good one.
-Great.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.589
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right, so, off you go.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.330
Hey, you know, that's also
making me realize, dude,

06:14.374 --> 06:15.679
-I'm pretty hungry, man.
-FRANK: Ooh.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.985
-Yeah. Whoa.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.682
Get some, get some cheese
out of your shoes.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
Yeah, you know what?
I couldn't fit any,

06:20.510 --> 06:21.946
'cause I got these stupid
five-finger shoes.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.600
-Yeah, I don't...
-Hey, get back out there, man.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.646
No, well, actually, go out
to the lobby really quick

06:25.776 --> 06:27.648
and get me, like,
some chicken wings.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.518
-You want hot sauce on 'em?
-DENNIS: No.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.998
I forbid it. Absolutely not.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.869
What-- Dude,
what is the big deal, man?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.306
-What's the big deal? Y-- Uh...-Who even cares?

06:34.437 --> 06:36.047
I mean, his pack's not even on,for crying out loud.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.440
Charlie.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.442
What'd you say?

06:39.486 --> 06:40.487
-Nothing.
-It's time we told him, dude.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.184
-No, it's...
-It's time.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.359
Uh...

06:43.403 --> 06:44.665
My pack's not on?

06:44.795 --> 06:47.058
-I... We...

06:47.189 --> 06:49.147
We-we turn your pack off

06:49.191 --> 06:51.019
so that when you're running
around getting shot up,

06:51.062 --> 06:53.413
our team doesn't lose
any points.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.371
But my gun still makes noise.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.591
Well, no-- Well,
that's you doing that, bud.

06:57.634 --> 06:58.548
No, it isn't.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.723
Pew, pe--

07:01.551 --> 07:03.379
Yeah. See, that's you, bud.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.511
Oh, that is me.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.164
-Yeah.
-Yeah, man.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.340
So-so I'm not part of the team?

07:08.384 --> 07:09.472
-Aw...
-Well, no, you--

07:09.516 --> 07:11.953
No, you're a very, v-very
valuable part of the team.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.476
You know?
Y-You're an amazing decoy.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.999
You know, you run around,
you're screaming,

07:15.130 --> 07:18.655
and you-you add sort of like
a monster element to the game

07:18.786 --> 07:21.658
that distracts and frightens
but entertains the kids,

07:21.789 --> 07:24.182
and, you know, so that Mac
and Dee can shoot their bases

07:24.226 --> 07:25.445
from the ducts.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.968
I'm the monster of the game?

07:27.098 --> 07:30.101
-Well, yeah, but, like,
you're like a fun monster.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.973
Yeah, like the Cookie Monster.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.540
I'm the Cookie Monster?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.367
-Not really, you know, 'cause...-No, well, I guess not

07:35.411 --> 07:36.586
-because...
-There's no cookies.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.588
Well, and also
the kids are scared of you

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
-and they're not really
scared of him.
-No.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.723
Uh, but, you know,
we need you out there

07:42.766 --> 07:45.595
because you're very valuable
to the formula.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.511
And the formula works, you knowwhat I mean? Uh, you can...

07:48.555 --> 07:51.558
I'll tell you what, go backout there and, you know, just--

07:51.601 --> 07:52.950
you can still make the sounds.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.606
-This is really sad...
-No. Uh...

07:56.737 --> 07:58.565
-...and I'm gonna
turn his pack on because...
-No, no, stop.

07:58.608 --> 07:59.957
I-I got it. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.568
-I'll do it, I'll do it,
I'll do it.
-Yeah?

08:01.611 --> 08:03.961
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's fine.
-All right.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.789
Thanks anyway, Charlie.
He's gonna do it.

08:08.357 --> 08:12.404
Oh. Oh, that makes
some good sounds.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.406
-It's cool, right?
-: That's really cool.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.626
Oh. Ah, I'm all set.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.410
All right. Get out there
and kick some ass, pal.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.458
Yeah.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.765
That's not cool, man.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.593
-Come on, dude.-Shut up, man. Just... shut up.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.769
He just believed it.It's-- you know, it's not cool.

08:28.812 --> 08:29.987
DENNIS:
It's pretty cool.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.641
CHARLIE:
I don't know.

08:40.823 --> 08:42.347
CHARLIE:
Hey, what do you
think he looks like?

08:42.390 --> 08:43.347
DENNIS:
Who?

08:43.392 --> 08:44.393
Big Mo.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.264
I don't know.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.789
Some fat little brat probably.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.530
Oh. Oh, is that a riddle?

08:50.660 --> 08:51.835
What?

08:51.966 --> 08:54.490
What the kid looks like.
Is it, is it a riddle?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.231
Charlie, do you not know
what a riddle is?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.102
Yeah, sure. It's like a, like athing you don't know. Right?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.887
No, it's not just a thing
you don't know.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.497
It's like a, it's like a puzzle.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.543
All right, here's a riddle.
Uh...

09:03.673 --> 09:06.241
"The more you have of it,
the less you see." What is it?

09:06.371 --> 09:08.112
-Cantaloupes.
-What?

09:08.243 --> 09:09.723
Cantaloupes is your answer,
because if you're

09:09.766 --> 09:11.072
holding a pile of cantaloupes,

09:11.115 --> 09:12.552
: you're not gonna beable to see very much.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.641
-Right. No.
-You know? Especially
if it goes past your face.

09:14.684 --> 09:17.469
-No. That's not the answer.
-You telling me you can see
through a pile of cantaloupes?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.645
That's not the answer
to the riddle.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.082
The answer to the riddle is...
darkness.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.693
Right? The more you have of it,the less you see. Darkness.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.477
Yeah, but how are you gonna holda pile of darkness? Does that...

09:25.608 --> 09:27.784
My God, uh...
Hold on, hold on. Wait.

09:27.915 --> 09:28.959
-What is this?
-CHARLIE: What's up?

09:29.003 --> 09:30.047
DENNIS:
W-We're dropping
down the leaderboard.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.571
We're in second place.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.442
-Oh, shit.
-Mac and Dee are getting
shot up like crazy.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.574
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
-MAC: Hey-o!

09:36.445 --> 09:38.534
-Oh, you guys, that is fun!
-What the hell

09:38.578 --> 09:40.536
is going on out there?
You guys are getting lit up.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.929
-Oh.
-Yeah, well, you know,
what Charlie said

09:42.059 --> 09:43.539
kind of made us stop
and think about

09:43.583 --> 09:44.671
what the whole point
of this was.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.629
Yeah, yeah.
And we figured the point is to

09:46.673 --> 09:48.675
-just be happy
and have fun, right?
-DEE: Yeah.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.112
You know what we did? We-we
went down to the "Fun" Zone

09:51.155 --> 09:53.680
instead of the "Maintenance"
Zone in the ceiling.

09:53.810 --> 09:54.855
-: Oh...

09:59.381 --> 10:01.513
The Maintenance Zone.
That's awesome.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.819
Oh, my God.
That's such a great joke.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.821
I would never-- How do you evencome up with this stuff?

10:04.952 --> 10:06.475
:You're so worthy of my laughter.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.129
You're so worthy.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.522
No. No, no, she's not worthy
of your laughter. She...

10:10.566 --> 10:13.134
She told the lamest joke earlierabout a blind guy

10:13.264 --> 10:14.962
-and a dog or some shit...
-Yeah.
-CHARLIE: Hey!

10:15.092 --> 10:16.354
That's not a joke,
that's a riddle.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.879
And don't steal my shit,
you stupid bird-faced bitch!

10:18.922 --> 10:21.316
-Oh! She is a bird.
She is a bird!
-Don't steal my shit, Dee!

10:21.359 --> 10:22.534
-I'll blast you to pieces!
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.884
Now we're jamming.
Now we're jamming.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.320
-Let's get back out there, Mac.-DENNIS: No!

10:25.363 --> 10:26.756
No, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You can't just go running

10:26.800 --> 10:28.845
out there alone.
That doesn't work.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.934
Okay, you guys are justrunning around all willy-nilly,

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
doing whatever the hell
you want. We can't do that.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.764
All right, listen.
U-Uh, Mac, Mac.

10:34.895 --> 10:35.678
Tell me something, man.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.159
Who-Whose face...

10:38.289 --> 10:40.552
is on the 100 dolla dolla bill?

10:40.596 --> 10:43.207
Rutherford B. Crazy, of course.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.166
Rutherford B. Crazy.
That's right.

10:45.296 --> 10:48.430
Now, uh, why he be crazy, Mac?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.997
-Well, uh...
-I never thought about it.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.651
I don't...
-DENNIS: Well,
I'll tell you why.

10:51.781 --> 10:52.913
See, my man had a dream.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.611
To get into
the laser beam business.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.569
Right? And he never gave up
on the fundamentals.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.832
He stuck with what works.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.922
And now he get to go out and bewhatever the hell he want to be.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.837
-He get to be crazy.
-MAC: Uh,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.578
I don't think
Rutherford be a real person.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.623
-CHARLIE: Yeah...
-That's a cartoon.

11:07.754 --> 11:08.885
No, no, no-- no, not this guy.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.278
Uh, I don't know
who this guy is.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.409
I'm talking about the real guy.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.847
The guy who, like, built
this place 30 years ago.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.414
That guy. He had a plan,
he stuck with it, you know,

11:16.545 --> 11:19.113
and, uh, and now he gets to be
whatever he wanna be.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.984
-You know, he get to be crazy.
-DEE: Okay.

11:21.115 --> 11:24.771
So we aren't allowed
to be happy now,

11:24.814 --> 11:27.861
but as long as we are unhappy
for long enough,

11:27.904 --> 11:30.820
-eventually we can be happy?
-DENNIS: Well, I'm not saying

11:30.951 --> 11:32.648
you g-get to be happy;
I'm saying...

11:32.779 --> 11:33.910
being happy isn't the goal.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.783
The goal is to play the gameand grind it out until the end.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.828
And then at the end,
then you can,

11:38.959 --> 11:40.177
then you can go crazy.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.744
At the end of what?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.572
I don't-- the game.
The-the game!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.356
You know, whenever we're playingthe game. You know what I mean?

11:45.487 --> 11:46.618
And when is the end of the game?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.446
I don't know.
Whenever the game ends, okay?

11:48.490 --> 11:49.970
Whenever we're back on top
of the leaderboard

11:50.100 --> 11:51.841
and we got all thedolla dolla bills we need and...

11:51.972 --> 11:52.755
Can I ask you guys a question?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.626
It feels like we've been
playing this forever.

11:54.757 --> 11:55.932
-Does-does that feel
like that to you?
-A lifetime.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.325
Feels like a lifetime.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.979
-Yeah!
-I feel like I was born
in this game

11:59.022 --> 12:00.284
-and I will die
in this game. I-I...
-DEE: That's right.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.243
And this is the first time
I'm having fun in this game.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.201
-Yeah.
-No, but-but it's not about--
again, it's not about fun.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.813
So just, let's just stick
with what works. Yeah?

12:08.292 --> 12:10.164
-Nah.-Nah, we're gonna go back thereand have fun.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.644
Let's have fun!

12:12.775 --> 12:14.908
-Man, I want to have fun.
I want to have fun.
-Goddamn it.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.866
-This is getting
out of control, man.
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.347
Oh! Ha!

12:19.390 --> 12:21.044
It's a madhouse out there.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.177
I was bobbing and weaving
like crazy.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.874
All right, nice.
At least somebody's out there

12:24.918 --> 12:26.310
-doing what he's supposed
to be doing.
-Oh, yeah.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.834
I created a great
little diversion.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.967
I told this one dad
that another dad said

12:31.098 --> 12:33.840
that his kid had
a tight little dumper.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.189
-Oh.
-Oh!

12:35.319 --> 12:36.973
-That caused a riot.
-It did?
-Yeah, I'll bet.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.061
-Yeah, it worked.
-Hey, home run, Frank.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.671
-Yeah.-Although I'm a little surprised

12:39.715 --> 12:41.021
it's not helping Mac
and Dee more. They're getting

12:41.064 --> 12:43.197
-slaughtered out there
in the war zone.
-Yeah. Whoa.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.503
A war zone?
I was in the Wing Zone.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.679
You know, it was such a line.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.682
I mean, I had to create a meleeto disperse it.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.772
Goddamn it, Frank! You weren't
supposed to get wings!

12:52.902 --> 12:54.904
-Oh, shit, did you get hit?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.123
-Did you get hit?
-Oh. No, no, no, no.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.821
No, Charlie. That's my signal
that the food is ready.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.040
-Oh!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.432
-I'm gonna go.
-Nice. Get some wings, baby.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.520
FRANK:
All right, I'm gonna
get some wings.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.000
Wait, wait, wait, Frank,
before you go,

13:04.044 --> 13:05.480
-hang on, hang on.
Let me, uh...
-No, don't-- Charlie.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.351
-No, it's just so simple. Ready?-Charlie.
-What?

13:11.268 --> 13:12.879
Oh!

13:13.009 --> 13:14.228
Charlie.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
-That's the way.
-Pretty good, right?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.318
-Now we're talking.
I'll be back.
-All right.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.710
-See you, Frankie!
-Okay!

13:18.754 --> 13:20.321
See how happy he was?
I made a sound, too,

13:20.451 --> 13:22.323
-'cause I feel like that was...-You are messing it up.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.804
-CHARLIE: Dude...
-: You are
messing it all up!

13:30.679 --> 13:31.898
-CHARLIE: Can we just go play?
-DENNIS: No, we-- No!

13:31.941 --> 13:32.899
We have to wait for Big Mo.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.552
Why do you care so much
about this kid?

13:34.683 --> 13:35.945
Goddamn it, Charlie!
Don't you get it, man?

13:36.076 --> 13:37.599
It's not the kid.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.993
Okay, it's not the kid,
it's-it's...

13:40.123 --> 13:42.082
it's what the kid represents.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.910
What, obesity?

13:43.953 --> 13:45.128
No! Not obesity.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.303
I don't even know if the kid's
fat. He's just called...

13:46.434 --> 13:48.958
-He's probably fat.
-He's probably fat.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.046
Yeah. Obesity rates
being what they are,

13:50.177 --> 13:51.439
-he's a fat kid.
-It's out of control.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.963
-Feel like all those kids
are fat.
-Well, most kids

13:54.094 --> 13:55.095
I see running around here
are pretty fat...

13:55.225 --> 13:56.836
They eat so much sugar
these days, man.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.750
-Well, it's in everything.
-Whatever.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.056
The point is, like, I...

14:00.100 --> 14:02.276
You know, there's always some
Big Mo, some kid coming in.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.668
He wants to shoot you up,
and he's--

14:03.712 --> 14:05.148
he wants to take what you got.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.367
I don't want to give him
what I got.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.672
What, I'm supposed
to give it to him, man?

14:07.716 --> 14:08.848
I'm just supposed
to let him have it?

14:08.978 --> 14:11.067
Who gives a shit about the
Big Moes of the world, right?

14:11.198 --> 14:13.156
'Cause we, we play the game,
we play the game,

14:13.287 --> 14:14.766
but it's not like we ever
win anything.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.943
Dude, what are you
talking about?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.509
We've-we've been winning
for years, man.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.555
You know.
We're the best!

14:20.685 --> 14:23.950
Yeah, but, like, it's not likewe have anything to show for it.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.082
Whatever, dude.
I got mad dolla dolla bills.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.041
When those dolla dolla bills
stop coming in

14:28.084 --> 14:29.607
because we stop playing
the game...

14:29.651 --> 14:31.609
dude, you know,
you're not gonna have those

14:31.653 --> 14:33.873
little plastic army guys
that you like to play with.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.353
-Oh, shit.
-You set 'em all up
and you have 'em "pew..."

14:36.484 --> 14:38.529
That is how I get them.
I get them here.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.270
You-- Oh, and the little box
of bouncy balls that you love?

14:40.314 --> 14:41.968
-They bounce so high!
-Dude, what is that?

14:42.011 --> 14:44.013
-It's like the bounciest
technology in the world.
-Exactly.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.362
-Why is that?
-I don't know.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.624
And you can only get 'em here.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.583
But you lose 'em
'cause they bounce too high.

14:48.713 --> 14:49.801
Yeah, you'd lose them sometimes.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.542
-But you-you eat 'em.
-Nah.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.588
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've seen youput 'em in your mouth.

14:53.718 --> 14:54.763
I've just tested 'em,
you know, see...

14:54.894 --> 14:56.721
-You tested 'em?
-Tested 'em out, and

14:56.765 --> 14:57.984
sometimes I'm testing them
in my stomach

14:58.027 --> 14:59.246
just to see how they pass.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.031
-Well, that's eating.
-Nah.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.208
-Okay. But either way, pal,
you like 'em, right?
-I do.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.688
You want more of 'em?

15:06.818 --> 15:09.169
-I do.
-Gonna need them dolla dollabills to-to-to get more of 'em,

15:09.212 --> 15:10.605
which means we got to stay
on top of the leaderboard,

15:10.648 --> 15:12.346
we got to win at the game.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.565
And-and-and what about
our reputation, man?

15:14.696 --> 15:17.568
-Oh...
-Think about, like,
our-our legacy, dude.

15:17.699 --> 15:18.700
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.136
We've been in this game
the longest, right?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.921
But when we stop,you think they're gonna throw us

15:22.051 --> 15:23.444
some kind of parade?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.011
-They're not, no.
-Hell no, man.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.360
We're just gonna be
a-a bunch of dudes

15:26.490 --> 15:28.101
who, who played the game once,

15:28.144 --> 15:28.971
you know?
You want to be a ghost?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.146
-No.
-Like the, like the fart

15:30.277 --> 15:32.453
of meals past? You just
dissipate into the air,

15:32.583 --> 15:34.934
and then everybody forgets thatyou ever smelled up the place?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.457
-What do you mean I disappear?
-Like a fart, man.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.067
That's what I'm talking about.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.895
'Cause that's what Big Mo is.
That's what he represents.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.027
It's like a, a death.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.898
-Death?!
-A dissipation. That's right.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.466
So if you're talking about goingout there and having some fun,

15:45.596 --> 15:47.642
all alone, by yourself,
to see what's out there?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.296
You know what I mean?
You're giving this all up.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.298
Okay? And you're not just givingup being at the top

15:51.428 --> 15:52.821
of the leaderboard
at some, you know,

15:52.864 --> 15:54.954
laser-amusement-themed park,
man, you're talking about

15:55.084 --> 15:56.999
giving up everything.
Everything.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.827
Everything we built.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.437
-Everything
we worked so hard for.
-Goddamn it, you're right.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.004
That's the death!
We'll be done! We'll be gone!

16:02.135 --> 16:03.875
-Exactly, it's a death.
-We won't exist!

16:03.919 --> 16:05.181
And we don't know

16:05.225 --> 16:06.617
if we're ever gonna
achieve that success

16:06.661 --> 16:08.445
-ever again just out there.
-Damn it, all right,

16:08.576 --> 16:10.752
fine, you're right. We got,
we got to guard this space,

16:10.882 --> 16:12.275
and we can't let Big Mo
come in here!

16:12.406 --> 16:13.929
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.235
That's what
I'm talking about.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.454
CHARLIE:
Oh, shit, though. We'regoing down the leaderboard, man!

16:17.585 --> 16:19.021
DENNIS:
Hey, we can get it back, man.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.675
-We got to protect the base,
okay? Are you with me?
-Yes! Yes!

16:20.805 --> 16:22.677
I'm never gonna stop playing
this game!

16:22.720 --> 16:24.200
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
-I'm never gonna stop...
-Chicken wings!

16:24.244 --> 16:25.462
Okay, yeah, let me get some.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.681
-Here you go, here...
-Come on, let's do it.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.682
All right, baby.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.640
-What are you doing?!
-Got wings.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.120
I was trying
to keep Charlie focused,

16:31.251 --> 16:32.861
and you ruined everything
with your goddamn wings, okay?

16:32.904 --> 16:35.081
We get him wings at the end!
At the end!

16:35.211 --> 16:36.517
This game is going on too long!

16:36.647 --> 16:40.216
Look, man, WWRD, right?WWRD. What would Rutherford do?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.870
-Hmm?
-Who?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.176
Rutherford B. Crazy,
the guy, the guy,

16:43.219 --> 16:44.873
the guy who built
this entire emp-empire.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.093
-What would he do?
-He'd do nothing. He's dead.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.703
I'm talking about the guy.
The real guy.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.226
-Not-not the cartoon.
-Nah, the real guy.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.316
Rutherford B. Crazy.
He's actually, his real name

16:53.447 --> 16:55.492
-is Larry Takashi.
-Ah?

16:55.623 --> 16:58.452
Yeah. I worked with him
in the '90s. He's dead.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.975
-Huh.
-That, that can't be right.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.281
-No, it's true.
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.239
-Did you see the look
on that kid's face

17:03.370 --> 17:05.241
when I grabbed his glassesand I-I threw 'em on the ground

17:05.285 --> 17:07.678
-and stomped all over 'em?
-He blasted us to pieces,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.680
but it was worth itjust to see his little ass cry.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.204
Oh, Charlie, you got to get out
there with us.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.380
It's so fun.
We're finding all kinds

17:13.510 --> 17:15.817
-of corners of this place that
we've never explored before.
-Yeah, I'd love to,

17:15.946 --> 17:16.992
I really would,
but we're actually--

17:17.036 --> 17:18.428
we're losing right now.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.169
-MAC: Losing?
-I got to stay here.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.692
-What? Yeah.-Huh? Who cares if we're losing?

17:21.823 --> 17:24.260
Dennis said, like, if-if-if we,
if we leave the base,

17:24.391 --> 17:26.741
death is gonna come
in the form of a fat kid

17:26.871 --> 17:28.047
who's gonna turn us
into fart ghosts

17:28.176 --> 17:30.658
or something like that.
So I got to stay.

17:30.701 --> 17:34.096
-What?
-Death is gonna come
in the form of a fat child,

17:34.227 --> 17:35.706
who will turn us into a fart.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.186
It sounds crazy
now that I'm saying it.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.753
Dennis explained it
a lot more better.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.755
Dennis, we can't leave
the base, right?

17:40.885 --> 17:42.017
That's the deal?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.019
No.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.673
Frank was right.

17:45.716 --> 17:49.329
Rutherford B. Crazy's real namewas Larry Takashi.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, and he was the founderand owner of Laser Tag Fun Zone.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.594
Yeah. So what, though?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.509
Well, apparently,
he killed himself.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.337
-Really?
-What?

17:57.380 --> 18:00.209
Yeah. He offed himself
about three years back now.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.821
-Oh.
-Just opened his 100th
Laser Tag Fun Zone,

18:03.952 --> 18:06.041
and he drove himself
to a wishing well

18:06.172 --> 18:07.608
and threw himself down it.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.088
Well, uh, hang on.
Maybe it was a,

18:09.218 --> 18:10.393
-maybe it was an accident.
-Oh.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.135
Uh, no, he wrote a suicide noteon a Fun Zone dolla dolla bill,

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
and it said,
"It all meant nothing."

18:15.181 --> 18:16.138
-Ugh.
-Damn, man.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.444
-Pretty grim.
-That's bleak.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.620
-That's kind of bumming me out.-It's clear. Very clear.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.230
-Killed my appetite.
-DENNIS: Mm-hmm.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.058
Nobody came to his funeral.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.364
According to this,
his employees all hated him,

18:24.407 --> 18:26.279
and his family barely knew him.I mean,

18:26.322 --> 18:27.367
the guy was miserable.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.890
But he spent his life
building this empire,

18:29.020 --> 18:30.370
and-and it all meant nothing?

18:30.413 --> 18:33.373
Shit. So Rutherford be rich.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.376
Rutherford be successful
as all hell.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.160
But you know what else
Rutherford be?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.077
Rutherford be right.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.600
Because it all means nothing

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
if you're not enjoying it.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.082
The dolla dolla bills,
you know?

18:47.213 --> 18:49.215
The reputation, the longevity,
even the game itself.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.217
What the hell does it matter
if you're not having fun?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.044
You know, if you're not
having fun anymore,

18:53.175 --> 18:55.351
than screw it. So if something
deep down inside you

18:55.395 --> 18:57.136
is telling you it's time
to move on,

18:57.266 --> 18:59.355
then maybe that's
what we should do.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.618
So that's it?

19:02.619 --> 19:04.621
That's it.

19:04.665 --> 19:08.364
-Time to end the game?
-Time to end the game.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.237
Goodbye, base?

19:11.280 --> 19:15.241
Goodbye to the base
we've held down for so long.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.373
I am gonna miss it.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.507
But it's time
to let Big Mo have it.

19:56.847 --> 19:57.935
MAC:
Hey, Big Mo.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.462
Oh, what?
You thought we'd gone?

20:02.592 --> 20:04.420
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

20:04.551 --> 20:06.205
We ain't going anywhere.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.468
We're never leaving,
you little piece of shit.

20:08.598 --> 20:09.730
DENNIS:
Let him have it.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.695
Yeah, light him up.
