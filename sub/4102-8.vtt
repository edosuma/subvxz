NARRATOR: For centuries,
mankind has been the dominant species.

00:06.048 --> 00:10.679
We've domesticated animals,
locked them up, killed them for sport.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.643
But a series of recent
events seem to suggest

00:13.805 --> 00:18.436
all across the globe animals
have decided "no more."

00:18.602 --> 00:20.229
And so we were hired,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.489
a team of people from
different backgrounds,

00:22.648 --> 00:24.116
with different specialties.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.572
An expert in animal behavior,

00:26.735 --> 00:28.078
a journalist,

00:28.237 --> 00:29.534
safari guide,

00:29.696 --> 00:31.369
foreign intelligence agent,

00:31.532 --> 00:33.910
and a veterinary pathologist.

00:34.076 --> 00:37.455
Our task: to Hnd out what is
happening with the animals,

00:37.621 --> 00:40.591
why it's happening,
and how to stop it.

Previously on Zoo.'

00:44.711 --> 00:47.464
The global pandemic your father
believes was about to emerge.

00:47.631 --> 00:52.762
- It appears it has arrived.
- We're all here because you believe

00:52.928 --> 00:56.978
that these scientific theories
of a notorious crackpot

00:57.140 --> 00:58.483
are now coming to pass.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.861
Mitch Morgan, as advertised.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.896
This is Agent Ben
Shafer of the FBI.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.191
Uh, Jackson.
Hey, now's not really a good time.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.735
Jamie, listen to me.
Ben Shafer killed the optometrist.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.324
He's a corrupt FBI agent.

[GRUNTING]

01:17.327 --> 01:21.673
LEO: The Mother Cell is in every
single product Reiden makes.

01:21.832 --> 01:26.759
It's everywhere, it's all over
the world and it can't be stopped.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.423
The Mother Cell can
cure the animals.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.763
CHLOE: Dr. Morgan believes
so, yes.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.768
You're talking
about your daughter.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.056
Her name is Clementine, she's 10,
she was diagnosed three years ago.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.940
Why aren't you with her?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.023
Baby mama married a decent guy

01:42.185 --> 01:46.031
and I just decided to let them have
their family until she got sick

01:46.189 --> 01:47.657
and I started beating
down the doors

01:47.816 --> 01:49.489
of every research
hospital in the country.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.403
Then her mom put a stop to that.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.413
He says that he has
the Mother Cell.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.075
He's willing to give it back,
but he needs something in return.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.460
I have to tell my
daughter why she's dying.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.621
Your drug will cure her.

I'll expect a call from
you within 48 hours,

DELAVANE: I'm sending
you back to the States.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.930
To Pender Island,
Massachusetts, to be precise.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.186
Why? What's going on?

02:16.345 --> 02:18.894
Two weeks ago,
a cargo ship left Oslo, Norway,

02:19.056 --> 02:20.933
bound for Portland, Maine.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.899
The crew complained about an
unusually high rat population.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.487
And while there are
always rats on a ship,

02:28.649 --> 02:30.276
48 hours into the journey,

02:30.442 --> 02:34.913
the crew reported the ship
had become literally infested.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.951
That there were hundreds
of rats on board.

02:38.116 --> 02:42.212
Eventually,
the ship ended up adrift,

02:42.371 --> 02:46.001
not far from the small
resort community of Penden.

02:50.754 --> 02:51.846
MAN: Rats.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.640
Where a fisherman claims to
have seen thousands of rats

02:56.802 --> 02:59.430
leaving the ship and
swimming for shore.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.519
When local authorities
boarded the vessel,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.434
they found the crew dead,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.353
their bodies in a
horrible condition,

03:06.520 --> 03:09.649
suggesting they had been
attacked by the rats.

03:13.443 --> 03:17.038
Among the cargo was
grain from a farm

03:17.197 --> 03:19.871
that uses Reiden pesticides.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.376
So, what do you want us to do?

03:21.535 --> 03:25.005
Go to Pender Island. Conduct an
initial threat assessment to determine

03:25.163 --> 03:27.165
if a containment
protocol is necessary.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.800
Hopefully, it will not be.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.088
But most importantly,
capture one male

03:32.254 --> 03:35.053
and one female rat and bring
them back for analysis.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.346
I'm staying here in Paris for another week.
Keep me posted.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.272
- And good luck.
- Thank you.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.897
JAMIE: I'm just saying, all four of us
don't need to go. I could come with you.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.363
I could stay in a motel and go through
the Reiden documents from Paris,

03:53.525 --> 03:55.368
and you can go and talk
all things Mother Cell

03:55.527 --> 03:58.872
- with your friend at Harvard.
- I think you should stay with the others.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.127
A day on the island is a good
way to stay under the radar.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.004
And if anyone is looking
into Ben Shafer's death,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.257
more people you have watching your
back, the better.

04:08.415 --> 04:12.340
You keep saying things like that,
people are gonna start to think you care.

and I have the Mother Cell for you,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.360
but I'm not gonna be able to
deliver it until later today

04:36.526 --> 04:39.746
so call me.
We'll arrange a meet.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.783
How did a few rats
become thousands

05:16.942 --> 05:19.946
on the course of a trip
across the Atlantic?

05:20.111 --> 05:23.456
Well, if Mitch is right and the
Mother Cell is an accelerant,

05:23.615 --> 05:26.414
it may be, by being exposed to
it in a contained environment,

05:26.576 --> 05:28.954
it accelerated the reproductive
nature of the rats.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.997
Or we could be seeing
it in rats first

05:31.164 --> 05:34.259
because they have a
short gestation period.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.839
What if this is
just the beginning?

05:36.002 --> 05:40.473
We could face a massive population
explosion in the entire animal kingdom.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.726
A swarms of rats is one thing,

05:42.884 --> 05:46.309
but a swarm of lions,
tigers, alligators...

05:46.471 --> 05:49.071
How would we even begin to fight
back against something like that?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.442
Okay, first things first.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.353
We have to warn the
people on Pender Island.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.238
I'm pretty sure they'd be aware.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.241
Aside from a fisherman,
no one has reported any rats at all.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.448
None?
That doesn't make any sense.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.329
What does make sense since
this whole thing began?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.911
We need to capture
a male and a female.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.122
It's the only way to
see how the Mother Cell

06:08.285 --> 06:10.788
affects their
reproductive behavior.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.127
So we're going on a rat hunt.

What's the matter, raHki?

06:18.962 --> 06:22.637
The men that died on that
cargo ship were eaten by rats.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.891
Okay.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.350
It's been proven that rats that
taste human blood begin to crave it.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.979
Well, that's just awesome.

06:42.193 --> 06:46.073
There's something on your mind
and it's not just the rats.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.291

Before my dad got bad.

the beach every summer

07:04.925 --> 07:07.144

that hadn't been built up yet.

- He got hit by a car.

Yeah, I know. Clem told me.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.916
So he's been acting like a

What I meant was, is...

08:14.536 --> 08:16.584

You haven't seen her in eight years and
still, you haven't planned anything?

Why don't you take him to your

What about them?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.376
Billy T., the fisherman.

10:18.535 --> 10:23.041
He has a gift for exaggeration,
a fondness for whiskey.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.675
If he claimed he
saw a hundred rats,

10:25.834 --> 10:28.713
you can be pretty sure
he saw more like 12.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.471
There's nothing to
be concerned about.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.553
Actually, uh, there is.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.059
You saw the bodies on the
ship, right?

10:35.218 --> 10:40.224
Well, you seriously think
rats killed the crew?

10:40.390 --> 10:41.642
Rats don't eat live people.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.527
In fact, they're more afraid
of us than we are of them.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.654
The coroner hasn't
finished his exams yet,

10:46.813 --> 10:51.068
but unofficially,
he believes it was a carbon monoxide leak

10:51.234 --> 10:52.326
that killed those men.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.455
And then the hungry rats came
in and feasted on the corpses.

10:55.613 --> 10:59.538
It's tragic, sure,
but not sinister.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.540
Yeah.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.174
I've sent Mitch five text messages
asking if he's arrived at Harvard yet.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.458
No reply.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.548
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

11:09.711 --> 11:13.136
But I haven't reached out to him yet.
I have patience.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.426
I don't.
What's taking them so long?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.686

- No.

- I'm not a fugitive, Abe.
- Not yet.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.314
And it would be nice
to keep it that way.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.867
I think that you should
consider evacuating the island.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.030
- Just to be safe.
- Are you kidding?

depends on the tourists.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.374
Evacuating in the
middle of peak season

11:48.541 --> 11:50.418
would cause a heck
of a lot more damage

11:50.585 --> 11:52.087
than any rats ever could.

up, someone would have seen them.

few being spotted over by the Wilson.

- Yeah, of course.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.892

It's undergoing some renovations.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.437
All right. That's fine.

Well, it was really good to see
you, Jackson.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.524

we should get together.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.782
The Wilson Hotel.
That's where we have to go. It's huge.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.702
If it's deserted, it would make the
perfect breeding ground for them,

no longer viable.

I'm just saying,
they got shows on fishermen and repo men.
