<i>New Yorkers.
Gotta love 'em.</i>

00:02.502 --> 00:04.908
<i>A crazy virus turns everyone
into Spider-Monsters,</i>

00:04.979 --> 00:07.237
<i>but the next day,
they're cleaning up and moving on.</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:09.635
Look, it's him!
Spider-Man!

00:15.362 --> 00:16.760
I had lots of help.

00:16.948 --> 00:19.174
We're all at our best
when we work together.

00:19.338 --> 00:21.375
We got your back,
web-head!

00:22.963 --> 00:26.182
The mess in the city isn't the only
thing that needs to be cleaned up.

00:26.479 --> 00:28.323
Time to repair
some personal damage.

00:39.153 --> 00:40.401
Harry?

00:40.799 --> 00:42.752
You're experimenting
by yourself?

00:42.940 --> 00:44.448
I told you I'd help.

00:44.932 --> 00:47.405
See those ruins at the top
of this building?

00:47.619 --> 00:49.877
That insult
to the Osborn legacy?

00:50.057 --> 00:52.893
That's what happened the last
time you helped, Spider-Man.

00:53.073 --> 00:56.311
I understand why you're mad,
but we had to save the city.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.619
I never wanted to hurt you
or your family.

00:58.807 --> 01:01.701
Oh, yeah? Tell that to him.

01:02.024 --> 01:04.208
Harry, we all thought
mixing Anya's serum

01:04.275 --> 01:06.360
with my blood was the only
way to save your dad.

01:06.830 --> 01:08.877
We didn't know it'd have
any negative effects,

01:09.096 --> 01:10.986
nor did we have
any other options.

01:11.065 --> 01:12.721
Well,
now he's getting worse.

01:12.846 --> 01:15.955
- Have you tried analyzing the...
- I'm trying everything!

01:16.084 --> 01:17.895
But it'd be much easier
to find a cure

01:17.963 --> 01:20.484
if you hadn't blown up
half the lab facilities in the building.

01:21.024 --> 01:22.899
That's why I want to help.

01:23.161 --> 01:26.180
Not as Spider-Man,
but as Peter Parker...

01:27.141 --> 01:28.524
your best friend.

01:28.828 --> 01:31.034
Huh? What...

01:31.477 --> 01:32.846
What is that?

01:34.797 --> 01:36.407
Go play hero.

01:36.928 --> 01:38.218
You're not wanted here.

01:38.483 --> 01:41.196
I'll... I'll try to be back soon.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.446
Hmph.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.758
- Aah!
- Need a little pick-me-up?

02:01.925 --> 02:03.625
What happened?

02:03.956 --> 02:06.696
Some kind of monster smashed
up our science conference.

02:06.813 --> 02:09.136
It grabbed our keynote speaker,
Max Modell.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.554
Oh, no. Not Max.

02:14.753 --> 02:16.821
Max! Where are you?

02:21.552 --> 02:22.782
Uh-oh.

02:27.344 --> 02:28.430
Doc Ock!

02:28.547 --> 02:31.985
Say good-bye to your friend,
Spider-Man.

02:32.154 --> 02:34.446
This is the last chance
you'll get.

02:34.514 --> 02:36.568
Max! Let him go!

02:47.218 --> 02:51.438
Didn't Mommy Octopus teach you that
capturing a genius isn't polite?

02:51.585 --> 02:52.697
"Genius"?

02:53.522 --> 02:56.501
Everyone throws that term
around so loosely,

02:56.725 --> 02:59.728
whereas I, an indisputable genius,

02:59.796 --> 03:04.892
was continuously stymied by lesser
thinkers such as Max Modell.

03:05.035 --> 03:07.775
"Stymied"? Earth to Mr. Vocab,

03:07.954 --> 03:11.095
Max funded your research
and gave you a job at Horizon.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.283
Then he pulled his support,

03:13.394 --> 03:18.392
practically driving me into the hands
of that megalomaniac Norman Osborn,

03:18.517 --> 03:21.095
who thought he could steal
what was rightfully mine.

03:21.163 --> 03:24.642
Well,
Osborn learned you don't mess

03:24.710 --> 03:26.744
with Dr. Octopus!

03:29.697 --> 03:31.587
Why'd you start a fire,
Ock?

03:31.699 --> 03:33.892
You wanna become fried
calamari?

03:36.572 --> 03:39.159
I do not have time
for this!

03:40.671 --> 03:43.647
I have one last item
on my to-do list.

03:44.332 --> 03:45.378
Ha!

03:45.566 --> 03:50.300
Minions, the spider thinks he can
control what your master does.

03:50.414 --> 03:52.892
Talking to yourself.
That's a good sign.

03:53.071 --> 03:55.753
I'm talking to them.

03:56.524 --> 03:57.831
Whoa!

04:01.078 --> 04:03.528
Rhino! Vulture!
Spider-Slayer!

04:03.757 --> 04:05.254
With upgrades?

04:05.432 --> 04:07.296
Someone's been a busy mad scientist.

04:07.364 --> 04:10.001
And who's that?
Metal-Minion? Shiny-Spider?

04:10.150 --> 04:13.143
Come on, Ock. I thought I was
the only arachnid in your life.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.726
Ugh. I can assure you,
no expense was spared

04:16.809 --> 04:21.437
in the transforming of Ollie
Osnick into the Steel Spider.

04:21.584 --> 04:24.992
A perfect addition to my Sinister Five.

04:25.660 --> 04:29.023
By the way, "The Sinister Five"
is a great name for a boy band.

04:29.123 --> 04:31.529
Mock all you want, Spider-Man!

04:31.646 --> 04:34.961
Modell's clock is ticking.

04:40.063 --> 04:41.906
Spider-tracer?

04:42.767 --> 04:45.023
I know all your tricks.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.953
But do you know mine?

04:56.983 --> 05:00.250
So much for getting
right back to help Harry.

05:00.763 --> 05:02.990
I've got another
round of trials, Dad.

05:04.658 --> 05:06.074
Son...

05:06.386 --> 05:08.229
Your vitals are getting
weaker.

05:08.418 --> 05:11.019
If one of these chemicals
can bond with your DNA,

05:11.096 --> 05:14.442
it should be effective in counteracting
the damage from Spider-Man's blood.

05:14.793 --> 05:19.731
But if not, it could take even
more out of you. Maybe too much.

05:21.473 --> 05:24.059
Some risks must be taken.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.145
No. You're too weak.

05:26.286 --> 05:29.028
I'm not gonna
let my cure be what destroys you.

05:29.690 --> 05:31.949
If only there were
a way to test it without...

05:32.347 --> 05:34.715
Wait. We're family.

05:34.946 --> 05:37.551
If it'll bond to my DNA,
it'll bond to yours.

05:38.015 --> 05:40.845
But I can't experiment on myself.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.020
Dad!

05:47.747 --> 05:49.543
I don't have a choice.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.931
I won't lose you again.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.754
Looks like I don't
even need a spider-tracer, Ock!

06:03.951 --> 06:06.692
It's a good thing you don't
call yourself Doc Stealth.

06:10.429 --> 06:11.614
Vulture!

06:11.786 --> 06:14.137
Did you say something?
Couldn't hear you.

06:14.306 --> 06:17.169
Just kidding. You're super loud.
Obnoxious, really.

06:17.270 --> 06:20.864
You used to be much more chatty.
Not sure I prefer the strong and...

06:20.932 --> 06:23.184
completely
mind-controlled type?

06:24.620 --> 06:27.567
Guess Jackal gave Ock
his mind-control devices as promised.

06:27.635 --> 06:31.270
'Cause, really, I'm sure none of you
would hang out with Ock by choice.

06:31.622 --> 06:34.317
I'm no ornithologist,
but can real vultures do that?

06:34.385 --> 06:36.515
I'd hate for you to be
scientifically inaccurate.

06:36.653 --> 06:40.168
Hey, let's ride share! Whoa!

06:49.865 --> 06:51.009
You want me off?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.778
How about
a little follow the leader?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.817
Bet you can't catch me!

07:00.126 --> 07:03.660
Nighty-night, birdbrain.
Now to find Doc and Max.

07:07.967 --> 07:09.567
Steel Spider, right?

07:09.637 --> 07:12.825
No offense, but I was an
arachnid before it was trendy.

07:14.683 --> 07:18.770
In fact, the whole city turned to spiders,
so you're really behind the curve.

07:24.478 --> 07:28.043
Man, you are so heavy metal! 'Cause
steel has an average density

07:28.111 --> 07:30.286
of around 8,000 kilograms
per cubic meter.

07:30.413 --> 07:31.739
Get it?

07:33.207 --> 07:35.786
Trust me, Ollie, if you
weren't all mind-controlled right now,

07:35.863 --> 07:37.903
you'd think that quip was hilarious!

07:50.788 --> 07:52.840
Okay, that tornado thing was crazy,

07:53.129 --> 07:55.817
but how many more tricks
can metal disks really do?

07:56.122 --> 07:57.489
Electroshocks?

07:57.644 --> 08:00.491
Why do I always say
dumb things like that?

08:02.387 --> 08:03.731
Aah!

08:30.215 --> 08:32.660
I just remembered,
I have another appointment.

08:32.764 --> 08:34.481
Can we continue this later?

08:35.268 --> 08:36.442
Aah!

08:39.676 --> 08:42.629
I don't have time to play
dodgeball with metal me.

08:43.855 --> 08:47.493
But maybe I do have time for...
kickball!

08:47.642 --> 08:48.864
Aah!

08:49.164 --> 08:50.700
Aah!

08:52.090 --> 08:54.481
Okay. Now, back to...

08:55.147 --> 08:58.817
What? Is it wrong that I'm hoping
this is a natural earthquake

08:58.981 --> 09:01.254
and not a... rhino?!

09:01.523 --> 09:02.762
Aah!

09:04.699 --> 09:06.911
Nope,
nothing natural about that.

09:13.395 --> 09:14.989
Not good enough!

09:15.225 --> 09:17.325
This has got to work!

09:17.643 --> 09:20.778
Harry, you're losing control.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.473
You shouldn't...
test on yourself.

09:25.247 --> 09:28.582
You're the one who taught me true
breakthroughs are always risky.

09:28.736 --> 09:32.864
I'm going to heal you,
whatever it takes.

09:43.261 --> 09:45.629
Can I have a time-out?

10:01.586 --> 10:03.227
Can anything stop him?

10:05.180 --> 10:07.359
Maybe that train can.

10:08.719 --> 10:10.781
This might not be the best science,

10:10.945 --> 10:13.500
but I'm pretty sure trains beat rhinos.

10:19.022 --> 10:21.893
I know it's crazy,

10:22.244 --> 10:25.038
But crazy's better than nothing.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.896
Huh?

10:34.300 --> 10:37.234
Oh... so... sorry.

10:37.412 --> 10:38.762
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

10:39.626 --> 10:41.059
Oh, man.

10:42.462 --> 10:44.944
Okay, I admit that hurt.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.949
Oh, there's gotta be an easier
way to get around town.

10:52.645 --> 10:55.067
Who am I kidding?

10:55.277 --> 10:57.802
Ock could be on the other side
of the city by now.

10:58.749 --> 11:00.011
Wait.

11:01.847 --> 11:04.160
Ock had that secret lab
outside of Horizon.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.900
I saw it
when we were teammates.

11:06.026 --> 11:08.014
Ugh. We were teammates.

11:08.082 --> 11:10.675
That is such
an embarrassing memory now.

11:12.502 --> 11:13.527
There.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.221
Now, would that giant-brained
genius really be dumb enough

11:16.289 --> 11:18.092
to go to the one place
I'd remember?

11:18.223 --> 11:22.518
Yep. Even giant-brained geniuses
can be painfully predictable.

11:23.727 --> 11:26.127
Uh-oh! Aah!

11:27.134 --> 11:28.901
Spider Slayer!

11:29.209 --> 11:30.706
Aah!

11:31.291 --> 11:34.713
Focus, Spidey. You're beaten up,
but you got this!

11:37.909 --> 11:40.541
Ah, you've arrived.

11:40.806 --> 11:44.268
Which means the first part
of my plan is complete.

11:44.511 --> 11:49.582
- "First part"? Let Max Modell go.
- But of course.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.166
Huh?

11:52.980 --> 11:55.698
Is this another one
of your tricks, Otto?

11:55.827 --> 11:59.430
Of course not.
You are free to go, Modell.

11:59.547 --> 12:01.557
This was never about you.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.874
It was about Spider-Man.

12:04.331 --> 12:07.666
And wearing him down
with my Sinister Five.

12:08.689 --> 12:11.900
And I think we've
done that, haven't we?

12:11.987 --> 12:14.894
- Spider-Man!
- We're through with you, Modell.

12:15.095 --> 12:17.491
Take him out of my sight.

12:17.721 --> 12:21.463
No! Leave Spider-Man alone!

12:21.848 --> 12:25.989
Ohh, nice try,
web-head.

12:26.143 --> 12:29.036
But I believe the fight has gone
out of you.

12:29.205 --> 12:30.909
Don't be so sure, Ock.

12:31.057 --> 12:33.807
You and the Sinister Five
are coming with me.

12:33.963 --> 12:36.361
Oh, on the contrary.

12:36.604 --> 12:38.424
You are coming...

12:39.205 --> 12:40.843
with me.

12:41.107 --> 12:43.900
And it is the "Sinister Six" now!

12:55.948 --> 12:57.681
Run! Run!

13:02.549 --> 13:03.955
- Huh?
- What just hit us?

13:04.023 --> 13:07.650
You were just hit
by the new masters of the city!

13:15.885 --> 13:17.799
Behold,

13:18.450 --> 13:22.604
the terrifying might
of my Sinister Six!

13:22.837 --> 13:26.486
Ooh, I was right. That sounds
so much better than "Five."

13:27.160 --> 13:29.650
With this windfall,
my experiments

13:29.721 --> 13:33.627
will no longer be held back
by lack of resources.

13:35.002 --> 13:37.439
<i>The attack has come
completely out of nowhere,</i>

13:37.507 --> 13:39.322
<i>but the most
shocking turn of events...</i>

13:39.390 --> 13:43.385
<i>it appears Spider-Man is working
alongside these villains.</i>

13:43.664 --> 13:47.807
<i>If New York's hero has gone bad,
who will protect the city?</i>

13:47.875 --> 13:49.110
Spider-Man?

13:49.318 --> 13:53.135
It's exactly what I always
believed Spider-Man would become.

13:53.402 --> 13:55.104
Dad, don't talk.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.408
- You're still weak.
- No, son.

13:57.476 --> 14:01.752
Thanks to your hard work and sacrifice,
that cure did the trick.

14:01.906 --> 14:05.596
All traces of the spider DNA
have been removed from my body.

14:05.664 --> 14:08.852
And now you must remove
the spider from the city.

14:09.084 --> 14:12.432
Clearly he's the menace
I always said he was.

14:13.007 --> 14:16.673
- What are you talking about?
- Son, a great man once said,

14:16.781 --> 14:20.447
"A foolish consistency is the
Hobgoblin of little minds."

14:20.515 --> 14:23.145
Spider-Man has consistently
been a menace,

14:23.213 --> 14:28.088
and you must be the goblin that opens
his mind to the error of his ways.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.314
I-It doesn't make any sense.

14:30.442 --> 14:33.216
It betrays everything
Spider-Man stands for.

14:33.515 --> 14:38.227
It wasn't just Spider-Man who saved
New York from the spider virus.

14:38.679 --> 14:40.291
It was you, Harry.

14:40.854 --> 14:44.908
You're much more than a
scientist, you're a hero.

14:45.236 --> 14:48.986
And now Spider-Man has finally
shown his true colors.

14:49.054 --> 14:53.463
It's time for an Osborn
to finally stand up to him.

14:57.804 --> 15:01.216
Do you want to truly make me
proud?

15:01.889 --> 15:04.420
Stop Spider-Man.

15:10.768 --> 15:15.143
Yet another mere annoyance.
Get them!

15:35.943 --> 15:40.529
Dr. Octopus, your reign
of terror ends here.

15:41.646 --> 15:45.537
I don't know who you are,
but you clearly lack intelligence

15:45.605 --> 15:49.585
if you believe you could possibly
be a match for my Sinister Six!

15:49.731 --> 15:52.185
Destroy this imbecile!

16:18.791 --> 16:22.361
Don't let this clown play
you for fools! Get him!

16:30.106 --> 16:33.783
I am here
to bring you all to justice!

16:37.177 --> 16:39.455
And you! Traitor!

16:39.523 --> 16:41.791
You were supposed to be a hero!

16:42.227 --> 16:46.838
Even so-called heroes aren't strong
enough to resist my mind control.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.869
Mind control?

16:53.921 --> 16:56.220
Spider-Man, this isn't you.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.697
Ock's making you do this.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.746
I know
I haven't been your biggest fan,

16:59.893 --> 17:01.876
and my dad is convinced
you're a menace,

17:01.944 --> 17:06.345
but if you're the person I hope
you are, you'll fight this!

17:18.314 --> 17:20.573
Peter, please!

17:20.974 --> 17:22.771
It's me, Harry.

17:22.856 --> 17:26.093
Even after everything,
you're still my best friend.

17:26.798 --> 17:27.877
Don't...

17:37.215 --> 17:38.539
Harry!

17:44.576 --> 17:46.076
Aah!

17:48.503 --> 17:50.745
Spidey, are you okay?

17:52.052 --> 17:56.785
You can fight off one of my Sinister Six,
but you cannot beat us all.

17:56.854 --> 17:58.441
This isn't about winning.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.882
It's about doing the right thing.

18:01.069 --> 18:02.444
You fool!

18:02.512 --> 18:05.069
It's always about winning.

18:07.326 --> 18:10.924
If you all can't play nice,
then you shouldn't play at all.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.444
You overcame my mind control?

18:13.512 --> 18:16.053
Th-That is
scientifically impossible!

18:16.161 --> 18:19.029
Maybe your inventions
aren't as good as you think.

18:28.870 --> 18:31.230
This is what
I get for relying on others.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.485
I am the only one
with any competence!

18:33.553 --> 18:35.328
Everyone else is an idiot!

18:36.085 --> 18:38.272
Watch your back, Ock!

18:47.113 --> 18:48.447
Harry!

18:51.817 --> 18:54.043
We are not finished.

18:54.689 --> 18:55.967
I am.

19:02.852 --> 19:06.293
Your targeting
is grotesquely inaccurate.

19:06.740 --> 19:10.001
Maybe.
If I was aiming at you.

19:13.139 --> 19:16.361
Wha... Octavius...

19:16.559 --> 19:18.421
He did this to us.

19:22.346 --> 19:24.249
This ends now!

19:24.317 --> 19:28.175
Do not betray me.
I helped you achieve greatness!

19:28.473 --> 19:31.856
You used us,
and you will pay!

19:42.412 --> 19:44.205
Harry?

19:47.765 --> 19:50.651
I... don't feel right.

19:53.144 --> 19:57.104
I... I just wanted to be a hero.

19:59.076 --> 20:03.409
Trust me...
you are.

20:16.141 --> 20:18.519
I saw what you did on the news.

20:18.674 --> 20:20.774
You were magnificent, Harry.

20:21.423 --> 20:23.472
Yes, he was.

20:23.844 --> 20:25.561
He saved my life.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.362
But I think he might've gotten
hurt in the fight... with Ock.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.825
I'm okay, really.

20:32.350 --> 20:33.719
You need to see a doctor.

20:33.926 --> 20:36.391
I will. You know,

20:36.638 --> 20:39.915
it was good to...
to work together.

20:40.721 --> 20:43.968
Yeah. Maybe we can do this
again sometime.

20:51.977 --> 20:55.180
I told you to take
Spider-Man out.

20:55.656 --> 20:57.235
You failed me.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.558
But, Dad, it wasn't his fault.
He was being mind-controlled.

21:02.222 --> 21:04.222
That's what he wanted you to think.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.789
Don't you find it suspicious
he was the only one

21:06.933 --> 21:09.831
who could overcome
the mind control by himself?

21:11.261 --> 21:14.050
I... inspired him.

21:14.476 --> 21:16.113
You're being naive.

21:16.521 --> 21:20.574
This was all Spider-Man's plan,
and he made Ock take the fall.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.688
Spider-Man's playing
New York City for fools...

21:26.977 --> 21:27.983
and it's time

21:28.051 --> 21:30.704
he finally met his match.
