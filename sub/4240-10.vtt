to think that her father
just abandoned her.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.647
How I would do anything
for her.

12:11.731 --> 12:16.360
How no matter what I do
I'm always thinking about her.

12:16.444 --> 12:20.697
How I'm gonna spend
my whole life loving her
and she's never even gonna know.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.660
You gotta let it out.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.417
How?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.378
By singing.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.172
"I'll Stand By You,"
by the Pretenders.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.135
It's in your wheelhouse.
And I know you know it from
the radio because it's a classic.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.972
And you do well
with classics, especially
in the soft rock mode.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.600
Yeah, I do like
that song, but...

12:48.685 --> 12:51.270
how's it gonna make me
feel better again?

12:51.354 --> 12:54.523
By singing it out
to the audience.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.027
Imagine your little girl
sitting there.

I can't believe you told your mom.
What if she tells my mom?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.879
She's not.
Half the school knows. Your mom
knows. Who else you wanna tell?

15:23.006 --> 15:26.091
She's not gonna tell anybody.
You're wrong. I'm right.
I'm smart. You're dumb.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.428
All this baby drama is making
my rosacea act up.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.056
I know. I just feel bad
for them, having to
go through this on their own.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.475
Let me see what I can do.
I'll report back later.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.644
[Quinn]
No, no, no. You're wrong.
I'm right. I'm right.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.771
She doesn't talk
to other moms.
Okay?

15:41.733 --> 15:46.028
[Exhales]
How do you explain her
constant irritation with you?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.405
It's because she's a girl.

15:48.489 --> 15:52.451
No, I think it's the pregnancy
hormones or something.
They make her kinda nuts.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.495
It's enough to wanna
give up women altogether.
[Laughs]

15:55.580 --> 16:00.083
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for
the advice about singing
to the baby like that.

16:00.168 --> 16:03.837
It worked like a charm.
I owe you one, dude.

16:06.215 --> 16:10.093
[Thinking]
Okay, I'll admit it.
I'm madly in love with Finn.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.220
I have been since
the first time we met.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.269
Dude, impulse control.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.313
He was my knight
in shining armor.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.483
My feelings only grew stronger
as we bonded over Glee,

16:24.567 --> 16:26.485
then football,
then skin care.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.988
Your "T" zone is
dangerously dry.

[Thinking]
I don't know why I find
his stupidity charming.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.256
I mean, he's cheating off
a girl who thinks the square
root of four is rainbows.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.967
I guess that's love for you.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.303
Hey, eyes on
your own paper.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.890
I know it seems weird
that I'm helping Finn
with Quinn.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.851
But rest assured,
it's all part of a master plan.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.479
No matter what I do or how much
I assist him with his ballad,

17:02.563 --> 17:04.564
she's going to end up
disappointing him
and breaking his heart.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.526
And then he'll be crying
into my shoulder pads.

that's gonna be
a fantastic teaching tool...

17:18.663 --> 17:20.163
about how to sing
a great ballad.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.125
Why is Miss Pillsbury here?
Uh-

17:23.209 --> 17:27.087

am very curious
about the power of the ballad.

of doing some career
counseling in song.

"Don't Stand So Close To Me."

20:03.578 --> 20:06.663
do you think you understood
the message I was trying
to get across with that ballad?

20:06.747 --> 20:10.917
Yes. It means I'm very young
and it's hard for you
to stand close to me.

Oh, no. Um-

20:13.504 --> 20:17.340

helping me out here? Was that
the message that you got?

- You're a very good performer.

I know you're into fashion
and that kind of stuff.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.961
And I need to find
something nice to wear
to the Fabrays for dinner. So-

20:55.046 --> 20:58.131
I couldn't be more pleased
and honored to help you find
something vintage...

20:58.215 --> 21:01.217
and appropriate to wear.

21:01.302 --> 21:06.806

he still keeps her toothbrush
on the holder by their sink.

still smells like her perfume.

but sometimes
I'll sneak in there...

21:31.040 --> 21:33.124
and open all the drawers...

21:33.209 --> 21:37.837
and lie on the floor
and close my eyes
and just smell her.

to fight in some desert
thousands of miles away,

and I can't even go over
to Dudley Road and tell
the Fabrays the truth.

Your father didn't charge
into the breach
empty-handed.

He had a weapon.

bring a gun?

let her in the house?

one of your Glee kids.

to realize she's in love
with you.

Is me having to deal
with the fact...

that my husband spends
all day with young girls
who are perkier...

24:03.234 --> 24:05.693
and younger than I am.

24:05.778 --> 24:10.323
I have a rash on my belly
from that cocoa butter
that your mother sent me.

how much it burns
when I sweat?

24:12.660 --> 24:15.245
I can't scrub the floors
as hard as she can.

you have to let me see it.
It might be infected.

What? So, now I'm gonna
show you the bleeding pustules
on my skin?

24:21.877 --> 24:25.421

gonna send you into the loving
arms of some teenage slut.

to turn one of them
into your slave...

irrational fear of me
leaving you.

all the boys in high school.

I need a man who can keep
up with me intellectually
and creatively.

for most high-school boys.

set much higher.

This is bad, dude.

'cause we're all so distracted.

We're all worried about Finn
and Quinn and "babygate."

26:57.283 --> 26:59.909
We can't even sing
about our emotions 'cause
we're so worried about theirs.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.454
Who cares?
Um, we all do.

27:03.539 --> 27:07.458
So we decided we're all
gonna sing them a ballad
to show that we got their backs.

There's no way
I'm singing to them.

Finn gets everything.

He gets the girl.

You need to get something
through your Mohawk

You're the baby's daddy.
It takes a hell of a lot more
to be a father.

27:36.905 --> 27:40.700
And that role's
already been cast
because Quinn chose Finn.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.702
And you need to accept that
and move on.

'Cause you have no business
messing up that girl's life
any more than you already have.
