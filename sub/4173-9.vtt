       you're wondering why
       I'm in City Hall, right?

14:48.388 --> 14:52.457
  Well, I plan to go down into
  the secret City Hall vault
  and steal the...

14:52.459 --> 14:53.892
          Oh, you, you knew
          that, right? (HUFFS)

14:53.894 --> 14:57.128
        'cause that's probably
        why you're here,
        to stop me, right?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.831
           What you probably
           don't know is how

14:59.833 --> 15:01.966
      I will get into the vault
      without being noticed.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.668
                 Behold!

15:03.670 --> 15:05.637
         My Blend-into-
         the-Background-inator.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.872
 I will be able to search out
 and steal the hidden deed

15:07.874 --> 15:12.710
  because, like they say, it's
 easier to find a hidden object
  when you're hidden as well.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.813
           What? (STAMMERS)
           That's a thing.
           They say that.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.117
         Anyway, I place
         the Inator on my head,
         like so,

15:19.119 --> 15:22.120
 I press this button and I,
 I'm here, and I'm blended in.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.656
          I'm here, I'm gone,
          I'm here, I'm go...

15:24.658 --> 15:26.524
        Oh, my head!
        (STUTTERS)

15:26.526 --> 15:28.793
       I hope there's no
       long term damage
       from this,

15:28.795 --> 15:33.097
  but, ugh... Anyway,
  I'll bet you think I forgot
  to trap you. Well, surprise!

15:33.099 --> 15:34.899
        You're already trapped!

15:35.669 --> 15:40.171
       You see, you don't
         have a number,
      Perry the Platypus.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.675
     So by the time you
     and your little dog
     get into the archives,

15:43.677 --> 15:48.546
       I will already be ruler
        of the Tri-State Area!

15:49.581 --> 15:51.616
           (LAUGHING)

15:57.723 --> 16:00.458
     I'm sorry,
     you cannot go in there
     without a number, sir.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.061
  Oh, please don't tell me
  you brought your dog.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.230
    Behold! The Dog
    Sensomatic Helmet!

16:06.232 --> 16:09.834
  It will amplify Buford's
 senses to those of a dog!

16:09.836 --> 16:11.669
     Okay, Buford, uh,
     what do you smell now?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.037
    I think I can smell
    the future.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.205
      It's working!

16:14.207 --> 16:15.506
                 Do you smell
                 Pinky yet?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.475
       I smell something.
       (SNIFFING)

16:17.477 --> 16:20.178

          No, Buford, wait!
               PHINEAS: Uh-oh!

16:22.215 --> 16:23.815
      Now this is
      a very old painting

16:23.817 --> 16:26.551
 depicting John P. Tri-State
 and Otto H. Adjacent...

16:26.553 --> 16:28.720
 Excuse me,
 I just need to get
 to the food court.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.589
        Please hold all your
        questions till the end,
        those are the rules.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.024
  And also,
  please refrain
  from gum chewing,

16:33.026 --> 16:36.794
  Also, there are no cutsies,
  or halfsies for funsies.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.764

 the stanchions, please!

              It's me, right?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.589
            Who's a good boy?
           You're a good boy!
           You mean me, right?

     How does this help us
     with Pinky?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.762
    Easy. I've been
    rubbing his belly
    with Pinky's squeak toy.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.996
       Now he's got the scent!

17:11.998 --> 17:13.865

           I can smell it!

           Yeah, I'm a

            not be the mailman.

           down the shaft

   Well, I guess it's not...

17:32.685 --> 17:34.986
      Not all that
      hidden then, is it?

17:34.988 --> 17:37.588
   Or maybe it's just easier
   to find 'cause I'm hidden!

17:37.590 --> 17:39.757

       was a real saying!
