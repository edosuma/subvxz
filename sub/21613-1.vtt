WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:23.934
(anticipatory music)

00:43.168 --> 00:45.830
(calming music)

01:18.662 --> 01:22.121
(speaking foreign language)

02:50.462 --> 02:51.748
This is very bold.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.205
And I feel like our client
is a lot more conservative

02:54.299 --> 02:56.131
than this.
- Okay.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.878
[Dan] I feel like it's going to be
very difficult to rein all of this in.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.507
But if I can
show you one picture here.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.759
[Dan] Yeah, but, no, I know what
you were going for, I get it.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.976
But I just feel like it's a
little all over the place,

03:08.063 --> 03:10.725
and, and I feel like
your cultural references,

03:10.816 --> 03:12.056
you know the Buddha images?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.357
- Mhm.
- I think that's really sensitive of you,

03:14.444 --> 03:17.311
but I feel like they're a
little literal, right now.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.151
Okay. Because you
see them a lot in...

03:20.325 --> 03:21.941
I know you do, but in

03:22.077 --> 03:24.318
this particular project,
just in general,

03:24.371 --> 03:27.909
I just feel that
this is a bit naive.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.080
I'm, I'm really
sorry about this,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.870
but I'm going to have
to put this one over

03:30.961 --> 03:33.749
into Emily's department, okay?

03:33.839 --> 03:34.795
Okay-

03:43.890 --> 03:44.925
[Group] Cheers.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.560
How's work for you?

03:50.689 --> 03:53.181
It's going well. I think.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.811
- Oh, the Asian thing.
- That's right.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.936
Yeah, how's that
going, is it...

03:56.027 --> 03:58.985
They like it so far, so.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.946
I would like I
would have hoped to,

04:02.033 --> 04:03.569
just a little quicker pace
would have been lovely,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.113
but, you know.
- Yeah.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.820
I'm keeping at it.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.867
[Sam] Are you supposed to go
somewhere though, for your...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.286
- The big trip!
- The big trip, yeah.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.870
- The big trip.
- That's right,

04:13.003 --> 04:15.745
uh not yet, urn, I
haven't been able to,

04:15.839 --> 04:17.421
you know I want to I

04:17.507 --> 04:18.713
[Laura] I know.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.711
It's just, it's so hard
to find the time to go,

04:20.802 --> 04:22.088
and I guess you have
to just leave everything.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.837
- Yeah.
- That's, you know.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.757
But if you, but if you're
gonna go, I suggest...

04:27.851 --> 04:29.637
- It needs to be now.
- You need to go,

04:29.728 --> 04:30.763
you just need to go.

04:30.854 --> 04:31.764
Forget about everything else.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.596
Forget about money,
forget about...

04:33.690 --> 04:36.398
- I really agree, yeah.
- Just go.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.813
[Laura] Yeah.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.031
Oh.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.082
Do you want help sweetie?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.504
[Joanna] Mhm.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.173
[Erik] You okay?

05:12.521 --> 05:15.809
Did you involve yourself in
a single conversation tonight?

05:15.899 --> 05:18.061
Smells like cigarettes now.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.902
Cigarette. I only had one.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.231
If you get pregnant, you
won't be able to have only one.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.483
[Joanna] You want
me pregnant now?

05:27.536 --> 05:32.201
Well, you'd look cute
with a little baby belly.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.075
[Joanna] Yeah, that's not a good
reason to have a baby, you know.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.331
I mean, eventually, right?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.955
[Joanna]ldon1
even like kids.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.165
You're just saying that.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.881
It would just be so
nice to feel your

05:46.972 --> 05:48.337
presence once in a while.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.967
Well, I'm present with you.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.722
- No, I don't, no!
- You stuck?

05:57.816 --> 05:58.977
I mean it must
have been something

05:59.067 --> 06:01.434
you wanted to
express tonight, no?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.896
I express myself when I write.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.617
I just wish you could
be more social sometimes.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.369
I'm social with you.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.962
- I shouldn't, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, I should have

06:22.048 --> 06:23.129
- No.
- I could have.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.967
Don't apologize,
don't apologize, please.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.002
Maybe if I spoke...

06:28.054 --> 06:29.795
Ssshht, shut up.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.882
(muttering)

06:32.976 --> 06:33.807
It's okay.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.009
- Yeah?
- It's okay.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.202
You sure, hon, it's real fun.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.666
Do you want to do
something else?

07:08.053 --> 07:10.795
I'm finishing it,
I'm committing.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.846
[Joanna] Good.

07:12.933 --> 07:17.097
You know, I'm going to
check my email real quick.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.559
[Erik] Want me to
come with you?

07:18.647 --> 07:21.309
[Joanna] No,
finish your class.

07:38.291 --> 07:38.996
[Erik] Hello.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.032
Hey there.

07:41.127 --> 07:41.867
Hi.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.043
I just got internet to work.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.089
[Erik] 0h. you got n?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.166
Mhm.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.001
Two bars though.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.964
For a moment I thought they
might have lied about it.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.937
Hmm.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.397
What?

08:04.484 --> 08:07.818
David and his
girlfriend are only like,

08:09.906 --> 08:11.522
seven hours away.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.152
[Erik] Seven hours?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.875
How many more days is
your scuba course again?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.082
- Six more days.
- Oh...

08:30.301 --> 08:33.134
Honey, I barely know the guy.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.586
[Joanna] Mhm.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.971
In fact I don't know
him, I haven't met him.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.975
And everything you've
been telling me about him,

08:44.065 --> 08:46.523
sounds like a, like a douchebag.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.276
What are you talking about?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.649
Uhm.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.947
[Joanna] He's uh,
he's really nice,

08:54.075 --> 08:56.817
that's kinda harsh.
- I know he is.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.031
I'm gonna take a shower.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.370
[Joanna] Mm.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.974
Honey, I'm going
down to the store.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.680
Okay, I'll come with you.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.435
It's okay. I'll go.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.771
[Clerk] You want the
receipt in the bag?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.853
Sure, great. Thank you.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.820
[Clerk] Oh, and we're
going to get that holy basil

11:00.910 --> 11:02.742
in on Monday that you
guys were asking about.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.697
That's great, thank
you. I'll stop by.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.205
Is it going to be the fresh one?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.119
[Clerk] Yeah, absolutely.

11:09.210 --> 11:09.824
Wonderful.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.409
So, Monday is the big...

11:11.546 --> 11:12.832
[Clerk] Yeah, Monday's
when we get everything in.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.412
So, if you come first thing.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.960
All right, I'll stop...

11:16.050 --> 11:17.085
Hey!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.008
Hey-

11:18.094 --> 11:19.459
Hey, hey, I can take that.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.178
Did we need anything else?

11:21.264 --> 11:22.470
No, I just thought
I'd meet you,

11:22.599 --> 11:24.761
and walk you home.
- Oh, okay.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.008
Thank you.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.264
Have a good one guys.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.595
[Joanna] You're
gonna walk me home?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.393
Well, yeah, why not.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.363
You didn't have
to stop writing.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.415
No I, well I needed
a break anyway.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.457
Mhm.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.006
Well, I needed
to get some air,

11:58.092 --> 12:01.630
so it's not a big deal
for me to come down.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.889
Don't you think David and his
girlfriend want to be alone

12:09.979 --> 12:12.220
on their first
vacation together?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.183
Well, he asked if
we wanted to come.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.268
[Erik] Us? He said us?

12:18.363 --> 12:21.321
Well he said you
so how do I know.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.740
You were the one who
wanted me to do this.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.621
Yeah, so why
don't you stay then,

12:29.707 --> 12:30.697
and finish your class and...

12:30.833 --> 12:32.289
[Erik] I don't
have to finish it.

12:32.377 --> 12:36.120
Yeah, but, you're not
writing and I wanna meet them.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.714
You were talking about commitment.
Now you want to leave me here?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.543
- [Joanna] I'm not leaving you.
- Yes you are.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.596
Okay, you've paid already,
you should finish the class.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.593
And meet us later or something.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.062
It might be good.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.937
What do you mean,
it might be good?

13:00.154 --> 13:02.646
Good for you to be away from me?

13:02.740 --> 13:03.946
[Joanna] No.

13:09.956 --> 13:10.787
Can I just meet them?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.034
Yeah, you can meet them.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.999
Go and meet them, go
fucking meet them.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.470
[David] Well, he can
stay and finish the course

13:31.602 --> 13:34.060
and meet us afterwards.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.308
Yeah, I know.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.643
He's just not very good at
being alone and he freaks out.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.894
[David] Joanna, he'll be fine.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.229
You should let yourself
have some fun instead

13:44.324 --> 13:45.610
of waiting for him.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.074
Plus, you have to see this
place, it's beautiful here.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.119
I got to go. I'll talk to him.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.331
I'm going to finish
the course here.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.789
(sad music)

14:06.137 --> 14:09.471
I wrote, wrote down
some notes for you.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.390
So you can find
us. It's in here.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.351
You already decided, huh?

14:22.612 --> 14:23.943
Why can't you wait?

14:27.909 --> 14:29.445
It's four days.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.443
[Erik] It's five days.

14:33.456 --> 14:37.074
Fine, it's five days,
and I can meet you there

14:37.168 --> 14:39.455
that evening, Night Market?

14:40.546 --> 14:43.379
That'll give you
some time to write.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.879
And I can email you
as soon as I can.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.706
[Erik] Look inside.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.283
[Joanna] Okay.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.009
I know you, you
wanted to go alone,

16:12.096 --> 16:16.556
but I think we can go together.

16:21.272 --> 16:27.063
Two tickets to
Thailand, you Erik.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.401
Your Erik, I wrote

16:28.488 --> 16:29.728
It says you.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.982
I wrote it on the
way up here sorry.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.238
Are you serious?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.319
Yeah.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.397
[Joanna] Hey!

17:15.535 --> 17:16.741
You made it!

17:20.080 --> 17:21.242
- Hi.
- How are you?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.614
I'm great. How are you?

17:22.708 --> 17:26.702
- I'm good. Let me get your bag.
- Yeah thank you, thank you.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.286
(laughing)

17:28.381 --> 17:30.748
I can't believe we're in
Thailand at the same time.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.465
I know, it's
surreal, I like it.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.667
It's awesome.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.842
But, you know,
meeting up with people,

17:34.971 --> 17:37.679
when you're abroad,
it's an obligation.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.798
Oh, so that's
your justification.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.257
- Yeah, it is.
- Thank you.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.638
You're welcome.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.719
I booked you a room, it's
not what you're used to but,

17:44.814 --> 17:46.896
you have a bed, and
you've got some warm beer.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.020
Good, that's all I need.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.391
How've you been?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.899
Good, good, you,
work, how's it going?

17:54.865 --> 17:55.900
It's been great actually.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.074
I left the gym, and
now I'm my own boss.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.026
I've got some
really good clients.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.111
That's great.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.787
I'm delighted to
be not doing it for

18:02.873 --> 18:04.830
a little bit though,
I need a little break.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.533
Yeah, of course.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.537
So, this is your
new little home.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.872
This here, seriously?

18:12.967 --> 18:13.832
Yup.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.213
It's the cutest. I love it.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.045
How do you feel, do
you want to grab a drink?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.971
Or are you too tired?

18:20.016 --> 18:23.975
Uhm, I think I might be too
tired actually. I'm sorry.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.972
That's all right, well,
I'm just there if you

18:26.063 --> 18:27.645
change your mind.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.058
You haven't changed at all.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.814
Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.027
You can choose!

18:35.156 --> 18:36.021
[David] Very good.

18:36.157 --> 18:36.771
Ok, good.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.402
- Good night sweetheart.
- [Joanna] Good night.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.575
- Good to see you.
- You too. See you tomorrow.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.569
- [David] Yeah, sweet dreams.
- You too.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.996
If you change your mind!

19:21.661 --> 19:22.867
Hey!

19:22.995 --> 19:24.656
Hi, sorry, I can't
get my internet to work,

19:24.705 --> 19:25.695
can you help me?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.447
They don't have internet here.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.578
What do you need it for?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.878
Oh, I promised to, uh, to
email Erik when I got here.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.916
But wait, you Skyped me?

19:36.425 --> 19:37.915
I Skyped you from my
phone, but I've literally

19:38.094 --> 19:39.801
just run out of money on it.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.048
Oh okay.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.887
They have a place, uhm,
really close to here,

19:42.973 --> 19:46.591
I can take you first
thing in the morning.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.056
Yeah, okay, yeah, that works.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.851
Where's Alice?

19:52.942 --> 19:55.855
Oh, it's a, it's a long story.

19:55.945 --> 20:00.064
She had to, she had to
go back to New York.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.023
You're joking
she had to go back?

20:02.118 --> 20:04.906
Yeah, she had to go
back for some work, and...

20:04.995 --> 20:07.077
Why didn't you tell me?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.997
You were on your way,
and I didn't have time.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.370
But it's all good.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.417
Okay-

20:14.004 --> 20:15.369
Internet? Tomorrow morning?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.754
- First thing.
- Thank you.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.003
- Night, night.
- Night, night.

20:19.093 --> 20:19.707
- Sleep well.
- [Joanna] Sleep well.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.883
(calming music)

21:03.387 --> 21:04.923
[Instructor] What's
the matter Erik?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.004
[Erik] Sorry guys-

21:06.098 --> 21:07.509
[Instructor] Erik!

22:08.077 --> 22:11.035
(Skype tone ringing)

22:15.000 --> 22:16.365
- Hello!
- Hi!

22:16.460 --> 22:17.916
Hi! Are you okay?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.710
Is everything all right?

22:19.797 --> 22:22.539
[Joanna] Yes, I'm sorry, our
place didn't have internet!

22:22.633 --> 22:23.589
Oh, okay.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.009
Right, so how are
they, are they fun?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.923
[Joanna] Yeah, I'm having
fun, it's actually only

22:29.014 --> 22:34.009
David though, because Alice
had to go back home to work.

22:34.103 --> 22:34.888
Wait, what?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.770
[Joanna] Yeah, but
it's fine, actually,

22:37.815 --> 22:41.058
it's, you know, I
never met her anyway.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.483
Until yesterday.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.570
[Joanna] No, she was
already gone when I got here.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.111
Wait, was she ever there?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.067
[Joanna] What, yes!

22:51.996 --> 22:52.861
Right.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.119
[Joanna] He's
with Alice, relax!

22:57.209 --> 23:00.042
What do you mean,
he's with Alice, relax?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.460
[Joanna] What?

23:01.547 --> 23:04.414
Are you saying it would be
different if he was single?

23:04.508 --> 23:06.966
[Joanna] That's
not what I meant.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.380
What did you mean then, if,

23:08.470 --> 23:11.087
because he has a girlfriend
now I should be thankful.

23:11.181 --> 23:14.219
[Joanna] No, I just meant
that you don't have to worry.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.018
I'm not worried, I,
why would I be worried?

23:17.146 --> 23:19.057
[Joanna] You
wouldn't. Never mind.

23:19.189 --> 23:23.103
You know what, have fun
with him, I'll, I got to go.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.160
[David] You okay?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.939
[Joanna] He was just so upset,

24:11.075 --> 24:13.032
I really hope he gets better.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.151
He's a big boy,
he'll figure it out.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.494
I don't know, I mean...

24:19.416 --> 24:23.330
He doesn't like being
alone, and he gets

24:23.462 --> 24:25.453
very dependent, and
then I feel bad because

24:25.547 --> 24:26.958
I get frustrated.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.214
Wow, you drank that faster
than me, I'm impressed.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.048
Yeah.

24:39.061 --> 24:42.395
How did you and
Erik meet again?

24:42.523 --> 24:43.183
Why?

24:44.108 --> 24:47.100
I don't know, I mean it's just

24:48.737 --> 24:50.068
SO...

24:50.155 --> 24:51.111
Random.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.439
I didn't say random.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.278
You meant random.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.865
We met the same day his...

25:03.210 --> 25:05.042
The same day as?

25:07.464 --> 25:10.547
It's a long story,
we needed each other.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.092
(sad music)

25:31.113 --> 25:32.069
[Erik] Hey you up?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.195
Good morning!

25:34.283 --> 25:37.116
Oh, wow, look at this!

25:37.202 --> 25:40.035
Yeah, that's what
happens, you know.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.533
- Yeah.
- Hey.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.120
What oh!
(soft moaning)

25:47.004 --> 25:50.793
Hey, you want to
eat in the garden?

25:50.924 --> 25:52.255
So, there's a but in
there? It's a but?

25:52.342 --> 25:53.252
What do you mean?

25:53.343 --> 25:54.299
What you would make it.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.547
I, I, well...

25:55.637 --> 25:57.093
So what was this?
I've forgotten.

25:57.181 --> 25:58.421
[Erik] Fika.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.757
Close your eyes.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.430
Why?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.260
Please.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.604
What is it?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.151
I made it for you.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.490
You made it?

26:22.039 --> 26:23.074
Thank you.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.116
[Joanna] Hello.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.868
<i>Hey, WY'-!</i>

27:09.962 --> 27:12.294
[Joanna] Hey,
I'm still at work.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.208
Oh, yeah, right, uh...

27:15.467 --> 27:18.175
So there's, there's
a blackout here.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.003
[Joanna] Would you be okay
being alone

27:21.098 --> 27:22.213
For a bit more?
I'm home soon.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.048
Yeah. Yeah right.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.349
[Joanna] Okay.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.219
So, when, when are you...

27:28.313 --> 27:29.849
[Joanna] I know
it's Christmas,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.601
it's only for a few
more hours okay?

27:31.733 --> 27:32.643
Oh, okay.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.232
Okay, I'll see you home.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.437
[Joanna] Yeah,
I'll see you soon.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.068
See you soon.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.167
- [David] Good morning!
- (door knocking)

27:51.253 --> 27:52.038
Hey!

27:52.171 --> 27:53.411
[David] Hey, how are you?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.337
Come on in, the
door doesn't lock.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.710
- Oh, shit.
- Ya.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.083
- Hi, sorry.
- Oh, hey,

27:59.219 --> 28:01.335
do you want me to step out?

28:01.430 --> 28:03.262
[Joanna] No, no, no, could
you hand me the T-shirt?

28:03.390 --> 28:05.552
- If you can see it.
- My hands are a little tied up.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.301
I won't look, I promise, hand.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.182
How'd you sleep?

28:11.315 --> 28:12.521
[Joanna] I slept really good.

28:12.608 --> 28:13.848
[Erik] Oh great!

28:13.942 --> 28:15.649
[Joanna] Great
actually and you?

28:15.736 --> 28:17.022
Good, although
I was up at 4 a.m.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.227
which is a bit annoying.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.278
[Joanna] Why?

28:19.406 --> 28:20.737
I have no idea, but
went for a bike ride,

28:20.824 --> 28:21.780
which was pretty cool!

28:21.867 --> 28:23.357
[Joanna] That's nice!

28:23.493 --> 28:25.359
Can't wait to show
you around this place.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.321
You didn't have to
make me breakfast.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.907
[Erik] I didn't make it, I
just got it from the buffet.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.207
[Joanna] That's the cutest.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.705
[Erik] There you go.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.295
They don't let you take
it to the room though.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.964
I just told them you
were sick and stuck in bed.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.507
Is it good coffee?

28:43.180 --> 28:43.965
Strong.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.839
It's not good coffee, is it?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.511
Yeah, I'm going
to put that down.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.808
Pineapple is my favorite.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.260
- It is?
- Hmmmm.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.973
Did you know?

28:55.108 --> 28:57.065
No, but now I do.

28:57.194 --> 29:00.152
- That is some good pineapple.
- Hmmmm.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.279
It's amazing.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.156
- Hey!
- (giggling)

29:34.189 --> 29:35.475
[Joanna] Come on!

29:35.565 --> 29:39.433
Ah, I don't want to get out,
it's like a bath, so warm.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.568
[Joanna] Let's get going.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.566
We've been here for ages.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.864
- All right.
- [Joanna] Yeah?

29:46.243 --> 29:47.449
We can go to
see him.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.901
We have to
go meet him, come on.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.368
We'll look around
a little bit first.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.913
No, I mean, if we go
now, we get closer today,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.082
and then we can meet him sooner.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.408
Cool. Sure.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.585
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

29:59.798 --> 30:02.335
- See, I'm easy going.
- Thank you!

30:02.467 --> 30:04.504
No problem, you wanna go now?

30:04.594 --> 30:05.550
[Joanna] Yeah.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.676
I want to swim
some more.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.719
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.388
Oh, you ass!

30:30.537 --> 30:32.198
Thank you.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.404
Hey, want to wait
here with the bags,

30:33.498 --> 30:35.660
and I'll go and check us in?

30:43.216 --> 30:47.881
Hey, listen, they've only
got one single bed available.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.463
Everything else is taken, so...

30:51.975 --> 30:52.680
Oh.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.722
I get it, I won't
say anything to Erik,

30:55.812 --> 30:58.019
I won't say we shared a bed,
I don't want to make your

30:58.106 --> 31:01.064
situation worse. ls
that gonna be okay?

31:02.235 --> 31:04.067
- [Joanna] Yeah.
- It's really cheap.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.193
- Yeah.
- [David] You want me to get your bag?

31:08.283 --> 31:09.489
[Joanna] I'm good, thank you.

31:09.618 --> 31:10.232
Okay-

31:17.000 --> 31:19.458
(POD music)

31:40.273 --> 31:44.062
I haven't slept on a single
bed since I was like 14.

31:44.194 --> 31:48.654
And I give you full permission
to kick me if I snore.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.445
I might.

32:01.837 --> 32:02.747
It's in Thai.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.892
So, would you like me on your
right side, your left side,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.602
or on top?

33:09.738 --> 33:13.823
You're a feisty little
thing these days aren't you?

33:23.960 --> 33:24.870
So tired.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.717
Let me get the light.

33:38.808 --> 33:39.923
Oh, sorry.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.521
[David] Do you want
anything to drink?

33:49.611 --> 33:51.397
I'm good, thank you.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.578
[David] Sweet dreams.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.034
[Joanna] You too.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.495
Sorry.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.583
Can we go somewhere
fancy tonight?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.710
Yes, I'm dying to
have some real food,

34:57.846 --> 34:59.803
I'm just done with
the Thai food okay?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.847
I know everyone loves it,
I need some western food.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.892
So, a place we could
have gone to in the States?

35:05.979 --> 35:08.220
Precisely, I know
just the place.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.103
(calming music)

35:20.702 --> 35:25.287
I'm so happy to be out of New
York, that rat race, it's...

35:25.373 --> 35:27.785
[Joanna]lhear
you. I needed this.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.618
Do you find that like,

35:30.712 --> 35:32.794
you start becoming who
everyone wants you to be,

35:32.881 --> 35:34.371
and being here just like,

35:34.507 --> 35:36.874
like realigns you with
who you really are?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.335
I mean that sounds really
hippiedippie, but, like...

35:39.471 --> 35:40.802
No, but you're right though.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.846
I mean, I don't know how many
personas I have in New York

35:42.932 --> 35:44.138
but it's quite a few.

35:45.769 --> 35:49.182
Well, I like the one
I'm seeing right now.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.013
If it's the real one.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.597
You never know.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.443
Thank you, you know what,
I've been thinking a lot

35:56.529 --> 35:58.861
about our habitat trip lately.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.109
- Me too!
- [Joanna] Really?

36:00.200 --> 36:01.406
Yeah.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.817
That's pretty special.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.239
Do you speak to any of them?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.662
[Joanna] No, not really.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.908
I actually, I
heard from Derek.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.626
He's getting married.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.043
Actually in fact, most of
them are getting married,

36:14.172 --> 36:15.879
and they're not even 30,
and I'm like, what are

36:16.007 --> 36:16.872
you wasting your life for,

36:17.008 --> 36:18.965
marriage is such
a waste of time.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.922
I'm going to be the one
guy with three cats,

36:24.015 --> 36:25.756
who is single forever.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.432
[Joanna] I kind
of like the cat guy.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.762
I think he should stay.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.223
You're the only person
who actually likes it.

36:34.359 --> 36:38.603
Why are you saying that,
I'm sure that's not true.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.690
You were so
different on that trip.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.364
[Joanna] In what way?

36:46.454 --> 36:48.070
I guess when you met Brian,
you just didn't want to

36:48.164 --> 36:49.575
hang outwith anyone
and you just

36:49.708 --> 36:51.290
[Joanna] No, I met Tom
first, Brian was in college.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.664
Brian, Tom, Kevin,
Charlie, Robert.

36:55.672 --> 36:59.461
You just, your life became
about them and nobody else.

36:59.551 --> 37:04.546
And I feel like, you know,
they dampened your light

37:04.764 --> 37:05.925
a little bit.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.133
That's sweet.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.899
It's not like I'm dating guys
like that anymore, anyway.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.029
Okay-

37:24.117 --> 37:25.152
Erik is not like that.

37:25.285 --> 37:28.573
He's patient and sweet,
caring, supportive.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.080
Good.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.269
No, don't hang
up on me, don't.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.575
(rumbling)

38:08.661 --> 38:11.528
(foreboding music)

38:15.126 --> 38:16.867
[Joanna] Do you know
how to get there, yeah?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.042
[Erik] Yeah, I'll be there.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.332
[Joanna] Okay, we'll
be at the entrance.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.000
[Erik] At the entrance, okay.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.206
So, where are you now, exactly?

38:23.343 --> 38:26.256
[Joanna] Uhm, I'm in our
bungalow, just hanging out.

38:26.387 --> 38:29.550
[Erik] Wait, you're
staying together?

38:29.641 --> 38:30.301
Are you?

38:35.104 --> 38:36.344
[Joanna] We just had
to sleep somewhere, okay?

38:36.439 --> 38:38.806
It was late, and there was
only a single room left,

38:38.900 --> 38:40.356
and we just...

38:40.443 --> 38:42.025
[Erik] A single room, what,
are you sleeping together?

38:42.111 --> 38:43.977
[Joanna] We just slept,
stop worrying, please!

38:44.072 --> 38:45.358
Let's meet tomorrow
and talk then instead.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.904
[Erik] Talk about what?

38:46.991 --> 38:49.983
[Joanna] Look, I need to be
able to have some alone time.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.820
[Erik] You're not
alone, you're with David.

38:52.956 --> 38:56.915
I'm the one who's left alone,
I bought these tickets for us.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.330
[Joanna] I know you did.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.958
[Erik] Look, I know
that, I didn't mean for you

39:03.091 --> 39:04.707
to take care of everything.
I'm doing the best I can.

39:04.801 --> 39:05.962
[Joanna] Erik, please,
listen, let's meet tomorrow,

39:06.094 --> 39:07.880
at the market, we'll talk then.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.338
[Erik] No, you can talk
to me, I'm right here.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.637
[Joanna] No, no, I got to go.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.682
I'm right here
talk to me, Joanna?

39:32.996 --> 39:37.035
Yeah, I want to pass time
and read all the books.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.334
There's something
about you and books.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.876
So beautiful.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.920
You think? Thank you.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.546
Yeah, I could live here.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.922
Erik, come.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.129
Where are you going?

39:52.181 --> 39:53.922
[Joanna] Come here.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.635
What? What is it?

40:01.149 --> 40:03.607
[Joanna] I wanna
ask you something.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.561
Okay-

40:11.075 --> 40:13.237
Do you want to
move in with me?

40:13.369 --> 40:15.076
Are you serious?

40:16.331 --> 40:20.120
[Joanna] Yeah, I mean, you're
there all the time anyway.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.199
Yeah.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.871
And I know I'm so
picky with my design,

40:25.965 --> 40:28.878
and my styling, but I
promise you can have a say.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.174
And we can move
things around and...

40:30.261 --> 40:33.094
Oh, no, I love
your Asian design,

40:33.181 --> 40:36.594
and all that stuff you
add to make it nice.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.057
It's our place!

41:18.101 --> 41:20.934
(cheerful music)

41:47.171 --> 41:50.004
Hi, just those and the sarong.

42:23.041 --> 42:23.872
Blue one?

42:25.501 --> 42:27.287
Blue one's good?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.209
Blue one?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.296
Thank you.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.172
[Rental Man] Thank you.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.491
(scooter engine revving)

43:34.779 --> 43:37.862
[David] So
anywhere around here?

43:37.990 --> 43:40.948
Yeah, I mean, I
guess this is it.

43:43.704 --> 43:44.990
You remember what he
looks like, right?

43:45.123 --> 43:46.158
[David] Yup.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.619
There you are, just
walk with me for a bit.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.870
- Wait, what?
- Please, please

44:27.999 --> 44:29.160
just walk with me
for a second.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.581
- Are you okay?
- No, no, I'm fine

44:30.668 --> 44:31.533
I'm just hiding
from somebody.

44:31.627 --> 44:32.867
Who are you hiding from?

44:32.962 --> 44:35.954
Okay, you see that
guy right behind you?

44:36.090 --> 44:37.876
No, no, no, no, no,
don't look so obviously!

44:38.009 --> 44:42.344
Just slowly look back, the
Asian guy right behind you.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.296
That describes
everyone I'm looking at.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.257
Oh shit, he's coming,
this is so bad, so bad.

44:47.393 --> 44:48.883
[Erik] Why are
you hiding from him?

44:48.978 --> 44:51.265
Oh, we had like, two
beers, and then we made out

44:51.397 --> 44:54.389
and then suddenly, he's all
like oh, shit, we have to go.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.560
We have to go, come on, please!

44:55.651 --> 44:56.982
Wait, I need to stay
near the entrance.

44:57.069 --> 44:57.979
Which entrance?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.403
[Erik] What do you
mean, which entrance?

45:00.531 --> 45:02.943
There's like 7,000
entrances to this thing.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.446
Minimum, maybe
8,000, I don't know.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.615
- You serious?
- Yeah!

45:08.039 --> 45:10.622
Oh my god we have to go!
Come on!

45:13.419 --> 45:16.582
I just don't know where he
could be, he should be here!

45:16.714 --> 45:18.830
All I know is that
I'm bloody starving.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.582
Why don't you just go
off and get us something?

45:20.676 --> 45:23.668
This place is
crawling with food.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.715
All right do
you want anything?

45:25.848 --> 45:26.679
I'll wait here.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.222
Okay don't wander off.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.141
- No, I won't!
- All right, see you in a bit.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.138
See you.

45:47.912 --> 45:50.449
Ah, I think
we're in the clear.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.041
I think we lost him.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.869
- [Erik] Yeah?
- God, it's ridiculous.

46:05.429 --> 46:06.635
So what brings you
to the Night Market,

46:06.764 --> 46:08.926
are you looking for
something in particular?

46:09.016 --> 46:09.926
Or just browsing?

46:10.017 --> 46:11.974
No, well yes, I was.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.687
I'm supposed to
meet somebody here.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.856
Why are we sitting here?

46:18.985 --> 46:21.477
Well, I've got to thank
you for keeping me company,

46:21.570 --> 46:22.935
and serving as my bodyguard.

46:23.072 --> 46:26.155
You've done, a really good job.

46:26.242 --> 46:27.903
I'm not very good
company right now.

46:28.035 --> 46:32.700
Hey, I don't think you
can be the judge of that.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.030
Well, I'm not meeting
my friends for hours,

46:34.166 --> 46:37.955
do you want to look
around or something?

46:38.045 --> 46:40.537
- Uhm...
- Yeah, let's look around.

46:41.007 --> 46:43.669
What's your name by the way?

46:43.759 --> 46:44.590
Erik.

46:44.677 --> 46:46.634
Erik, well I'm Miranda.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.430
Put it here, ready?

46:50.558 --> 46:51.889
- What?
- Let's go!

47:15.374 --> 47:17.536
These are kind of cool.

47:17.626 --> 47:19.867
Yeah, Joanna would love these.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.373
Who's Joanna?

47:23.549 --> 47:25.631
That someone I was
supposed to meet tonight.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.675
Oh, Joanna's her name.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.469
Joanna!

47:32.516 --> 47:33.506
Joanna!

47:35.603 --> 47:36.593
Yo hoo!

47:37.980 --> 47:41.723
Yeah, I don't think she's
here, she's a goner.

47:42.568 --> 47:43.729
I'm sorry.

47:44.779 --> 47:45.610
[Erik] It's okay.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.982
Hey, you know what you need?

47:47.073 --> 47:47.904
What?

47:47.990 --> 47:51.028
You need to meet my friends.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.572
- Yeah?
- You would totally love them.

47:53.829 --> 47:55.536
You would fit right
in with them actually.

47:55.664 --> 47:56.904
Oh my God.

47:56.999 --> 47:58.535
You know what before we
go to Malaysia we're going

47:58.667 --> 47:59.828
to the Jomtien Beach Party.

47:59.919 --> 48:01.580
Have you heard of it?

48:01.712 --> 48:03.874
Jomtien Beach Party? No.

48:04.006 --> 48:07.419
[Miranda] Oh my God, it is the best
time, the locals are so much fun.

48:17.978 --> 48:18.968
Thank you.

48:19.105 --> 48:21.972
It's just not like
him, I hope he's okay.

48:22.108 --> 48:23.724
I'm sure he's okay.

48:24.735 --> 48:27.227
You don't know that though.

48:28.531 --> 48:30.113
Look, I think we should
give it a couple of

48:30.241 --> 48:32.608
more minutes, and then we
should get out of here.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.942
Maybe he couldn't make it.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.620
I could check my email I guess.

48:41.710 --> 48:45.920
Mm, this is fucking
amazing, you have to try it.

48:46.841 --> 48:49.503
Ah, yeah, you don't eat prawns.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.045
You want to go look over there?

48:54.140 --> 48:56.006
Yeah, sure.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.966
Nope, it is vegetable
with fried rice,

48:58.060 --> 49:00.051
and if you don't like this
I'm personally kicking you

49:00.146 --> 49:01.352
out of Thailand.

49:02.314 --> 49:04.681
You didn't have to do that.

49:04.817 --> 49:05.898
Do what?

49:06.026 --> 49:07.187
How much was it?

49:07.278 --> 49:09.986
Oh, no, no, no,
don't be ridiculous.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.229
It's fine.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.784
Why are you taking care of me?

49:16.871 --> 49:18.953
Oh, I'm not like,
I'm not hitting on you,

49:19.081 --> 49:20.913
if that's what you think.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.786
No, of course not.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.548
It's not what I meant.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.841
Hey, come on, he's,
it's gonna be fine.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.090
Yeah but I mean,
even if he's okay,

49:35.181 --> 49:38.594
it's not okay though. Who just
doesn't show up like that?

49:38.684 --> 49:40.766
Isn't this what
you wanted though?

49:40.853 --> 49:41.968
[Joanna] What do you mean?

49:42.062 --> 49:43.473
Yeah, Erik needs
some time on his own.

49:43.606 --> 49:46.064
Time to explore and you
need some alone time.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.982
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.650
Look, I get it,
you're worried.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.985
But he's going to be
fine, he's a grown man,

49:52.072 --> 49:52.982
he can take care of himself.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.234
[Joanna] Yeah, I guess.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.818
You should to look
after yourself for once.

49:57.953 --> 50:01.116
We need more rum,
I will be right back.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.089
[David] You wanna get a drink?

50:15.221 --> 50:16.882
- Yes.
- You need a drink.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.047
I've got a bar
with your name on it.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.173
[Joanna] Bar Joanna?

50:20.309 --> 50:21.549
[David] Yeah.

50:32.738 --> 50:36.481
Erik! Hey. hey Erik!

50:36.742 --> 50:38.198
Hey, where are you going?

50:38.244 --> 50:39.450
I need to find a hostel.

50:39.578 --> 50:40.568
- A hostel?
- Yeah.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.283
Do you want to
stay with us tonight?

50:43.374 --> 50:46.332
We have like three extra
beds, it's like totally cheap.

50:46.418 --> 50:49.661
Well, I mean it's not totally
free, but it's pretty cheap.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.879
Do you want to, it's really
close we can get a cab.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.081
If there's one.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.836
[Erik] I can't get a
cab, I have a scooter.

50:54.969 --> 50:57.301
You've got a scooter,
give me the keys dude!

50:57.388 --> 51:00.346
No, I'm a great driver
I promise, okay.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.715
- All right.
- Yes, yes!

51:12.861 --> 51:14.477
Oh, here they are.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.024
[Erik] That's your friends?

51:20.119 --> 51:21.735
[Miranda] Yup.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.079
Come on, let's go.

51:33.882 --> 51:35.338
Hey wait, remember
that guy on the ferry,

51:35.426 --> 51:37.838
he said like you can just
pop them open together?

51:37.928 --> 51:39.089
Do, do you want to do it?

51:39.179 --> 51:40.795
- I mean, I'll try.
- Yeah, try.

51:40.889 --> 51:42.675
It's worth a try right?

51:42.808 --> 51:46.301
[Cecile] Oh my God,
I love you so much!

51:46.395 --> 51:48.477
I got it all over my legs.

51:48.564 --> 51:49.929
<i>“</i> What. S up g _ H“ "Vs?

51:50.065 --> 51:51.931
[Jamie] Have you
seen the bottle opener?

51:52.026 --> 51:52.731
Yes.

51:52.860 --> 51:53.850
- Oh, I knew it!
- Where?

51:53.986 --> 51:56.023
I've had it in my bag all day.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.603
- No way!
- I'm so sorry!

51:57.698 --> 51:59.188
- I'm going to kill you!
- I'm so sorry!

51:59.283 --> 52:00.364
[Cecile] I've been
looking for, everywhere!

52:00.451 --> 52:01.612
You guys are like animals.

52:01.702 --> 52:02.817
Oh, hi, Jamie.

52:03.871 --> 52:04.827
[Erik] Hi, Erik.

52:04.872 --> 52:05.907
I'm Cecile.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.326
[Erik] Hi Cecile.

52:07.416 --> 52:08.577
He needed a place
to crash tonight,

52:08.667 --> 52:09.873
so I said he could
crash with us.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.325
- That's nice!
- Welcome.

52:11.420 --> 52:12.581
Thank you.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.922
[Miranda] Where's
the bottle opener?

52:16.008 --> 52:20.093
I have it, it's not
going to go to you anymore.

52:22.014 --> 52:25.882
[Miranda] Really, had to
really regret that, yeah.

52:25.976 --> 52:27.887
It's so funny how
we met, you know.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.844
How we could have just
missed each other.

52:29.938 --> 52:33.021
- Alignment.
- Yeah, I know, that's crazy.

52:33.067 --> 52:34.523
Synchronicity.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.858
There's people
that believe in it,

52:35.944 --> 52:37.355
and people that don't but
there's no way that it's

52:37.446 --> 52:39.028
just a coincidence.

52:41.241 --> 52:43.653
So, what brought you here?

52:45.204 --> 52:49.038
Ah, well Joanna really
wanted to go, and,

52:53.128 --> 52:54.243
and here I am.

52:54.338 --> 52:56.170
- Yeah!
- Yup, you are.

52:57.549 --> 52:59.005
[Erik] No, we spoke
about it for so long,

52:59.134 --> 53:03.298
she was so surprised when I
actually got her the ticket.

53:03.389 --> 53:06.802
Well, hey, you're not
just a talker anymore.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.849
I was never a talker.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.060
So what about you, Jamie?

53:15.150 --> 53:17.733
I had to get away from
my family for a little bit.

53:17.820 --> 53:21.814
There were some moral
differences.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.406
Hit the road.

53:30.958 --> 53:35.122
Oh well, thanks for having
me, thanks for picking me up.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.625
Thanks for the ride.

53:47.182 --> 53:48.718
(door knocking)

53:48.809 --> 53:49.765
Hello!

53:53.313 --> 53:55.975
Jamie and Cecile are waiting,
we're going to the jungle.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.976
[Miranda] You in, or do you
want to stay here all alone?

54:00.112 --> 54:00.943
[Erik] I'll come.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.108
[Miranda] Okay great!

54:07.536 --> 54:08.867
[Cecile] Hi!

54:08.954 --> 54:10.991
Hey, sorry, I had
to find a computer.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.413
- That's okay.
- Oh, okay.

54:13.542 --> 54:14.748
[Jamie] For what?

54:14.835 --> 54:17.327
(calming music)

54:27.598 --> 54:29.885
[David] Any luck?

54:29.975 --> 54:31.511
He emailed me.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.929
And?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.476
And apparently he ran
into some backpackers

54:34.563 --> 54:37.021
and he said to meet later.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.816
So he made some new
friends, that's great!

54:41.987 --> 54:42.772
I guess.

54:47.451 --> 54:50.910
Look, at least
you know he's okay.

54:52.164 --> 54:55.998
Have some of this. It'll
make you feel better.

54:56.084 --> 54:58.166
It can't hurt at this point.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.255
Uhm, I want to take
you to this place.

55:03.383 --> 55:05.294
It's really beautiful.

55:05.427 --> 55:06.041
[Joanna] Is it far?

55:06.136 --> 55:07.922
No. Not really.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.926
Okay, sure.

55:33.622 --> 55:36.205
I'm in a fucking jungle
with Swedish tourists.

55:36.834 --> 55:39.917
Oh, sorry, forgot!

55:41.129 --> 55:42.790
[Cecile] Why not explore
a country when you pay

55:42.923 --> 55:45.836
so much money and
time to get there?

55:49.096 --> 55:50.302
Oh no!
Erik! Erik!

55:50.389 --> 55:51.879
5Y9, bye!

55:51.974 --> 55:52.964
It's safe, right?

55:53.100 --> 55:54.682
Yeah, it's safe.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.442
[Joanna] You see, 10 years
ago I could have never,

56:04.570 --> 56:07.358
ever have imagined, that
would be standing here,

56:07.489 --> 56:09.981
looking at this view, with you.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.540
Thank you for bringing me here.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.118
My pleasure.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.967
Ah, we found it!

56:38.604 --> 56:40.140
[Cecile] Okay.

56:41.315 --> 56:42.771
[Jamie] To us!

56:44.192 --> 56:45.432
[Cecile] First
night in the jungle!

56:45.527 --> 56:48.690
First night in the
jungle, bottoms up.

56:54.953 --> 56:56.489
[Cecile] So you
saw them together?

56:56.580 --> 56:58.412
Yeah, they looked so happy.

56:58.582 --> 57:01.324
So in love, kissing,
holding hands.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.251
I know they slept together.

57:04.379 --> 57:05.869
[Cecile] She told you?

57:05.964 --> 57:07.955
Well, she's yeah.

57:08.050 --> 57:10.417
She didn't say they slept
together, she said they,

57:10.552 --> 57:13.761
something about only one
single bed or something.

57:13.847 --> 57:16.305
Oh, but that's just
temporary attraction,

57:16.391 --> 57:20.885
it doesn't mean anything. She
probably still loves you.

57:20.979 --> 57:23.095
No, that's the thing,
I don't think she does.

57:23.190 --> 57:28.356
She, I'm not who
she wanted me to be,

57:28.487 --> 57:32.651
that guy full of energy, you
know, aiming for the stars.

57:32.741 --> 57:34.823
(groans)

57:38.789 --> 57:40.575
Yeah, no, but it's like
the longest we've been away

57:40.666 --> 57:42.077
from each other.

57:42.209 --> 57:45.622
She thought it might be good
for us, so I guess I'll,

57:47.089 --> 57:49.672
I guess I'll just
give her that, right?

57:49.758 --> 57:53.717
Well, it's good,
missing somebody, right?

57:53.804 --> 57:55.511
Yeah, but I always
miss her, even if she was

57:55.597 --> 57:56.962
gone for an hour.

57:58.141 --> 57:59.927
Well, that's sad.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.304
(laughing)

58:01.436 --> 58:03.393
Yo, that is messed up!

58:04.773 --> 58:06.013
How long have yo been together?

58:06.108 --> 58:08.224
[Erik] Eh, five years.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.231
[Cecile] You
remember the date?

58:11.321 --> 58:15.030
It's the, the same
day my sister died.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.913
Were you guys close?

58:28.213 --> 58:30.329
Yeah, we moved to
New York together,

58:30.424 --> 58:34.167
and she was the one
that took care of me.

58:36.179 --> 58:38.511
[Cecile] So what did you do?

58:40.225 --> 58:43.968
Nothing, I'll met Joanna
right after, like the same day.

58:44.896 --> 58:45.761
That's crazy.

58:45.856 --> 58:46.561
Yeah.

58:49.901 --> 58:51.983
Well, you're here now, so.

58:52.070 --> 58:55.563
[Jamie] Yes!
That is something.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.022
(speaking foreign language)

58:57.117 --> 58:58.983
- Is that how you say it?
- Think I know that one.

58:59.077 --> 59:00.909
[Miranda] Cheers, you
got to get that one right.

59:00.996 --> 59:03.954
(speaking foreign language)

59:04.041 --> 59:07.033
[Joanna] I'll never
be too old for a swing.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.709
[David] I'll never be
too old to be a swinger.

59:08.837 --> 59:10.999
(laughing)

59:13.467 --> 59:14.707
It keeps it interesting.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.959
[Joanna] Oh, that's
awful, that's awful!

59:17.054 --> 59:18.260
[David] Sharing is caring.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.051
Oh, God!

59:21.725 --> 59:25.013
What did you mean before
at the restaurant?

59:25.145 --> 59:27.261
What are you referring to?

59:30.275 --> 59:33.017
We were talking about
Erik and you said something

59:33.153 --> 59:34.860
what was it again.

59:34.946 --> 59:36.562
I actually don't remember, I
might've been a little drunk.

59:36.656 --> 59:37.270
Yeah?

59:37.365 --> 59:38.776
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you were.

59:40.285 --> 59:44.700
But you were saying
something about Erik being

59:44.790 --> 59:46.781
like my exes or something?

59:46.875 --> 59:48.786
I didn't say that!

59:48.877 --> 59:51.460
Okay, so what
did you say then?

59:53.256 --> 59:55.293
It's not important.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.293
It is to me.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:08.095
What I meant is none
of the guys you're with,

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:12.605
it's always the same.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.651
Here, what I'm trying to say is,

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:23.279
you don't need an
anchor holding you down.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.870
(hallowed music)

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.049
(elephant trumpeting)

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:42.219
[Jamie] Do you think we
can ride the elephants?

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.133
Do you think they'd like that?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.714
Who?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.095
The elephants!

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:51.686
[Erik] I never
thought about that.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:55.065
(growling)

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.516
So you've never
crawled before?

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:30.559
No.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.273
I can show you a little crawl.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.893
You can show me, I'll watch.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.611
I'll hold your stomach,

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.941
and kick your legs, like a frog.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.116
There you go!

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.299
[Cecile] What are
you writing about?

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.054
Uhm, life, I guess.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:11.929
It's, uh...

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:19.062
I don't know, everything
I don't express verbally.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:24.529
Uhm...

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:25.856
You don't have a title?

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.240
No, not really.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.326
Isn't that sort of step
one in writing a book?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.819
(laughing)

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.531
Can you read?

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.290
[Miranda] We can
name your book for you,

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.459
let's do it right here.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.043
Yeah?

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.041
The lankiest dude alive.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.965
(laughing)

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:46.214
[Cecile] Don't be mean.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.045
- No, we love you.
- I'm just kidding.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.512
Erik, do you want to dance?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.756
No, I don't dance.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.965
Want to dance,
you just winked me!

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.471
I think you want
to dance so bad!

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:54.642
I need to finish my beer!

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.932
Oh no, it's done!

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.057
Be careful!

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.478
She's so cute!

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.606
She is vicious
on the dance floor.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.944
So, would Erik be your type?

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.534
Erik, no, he's great, I mean,

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.325
I love the shit
out of him, but...

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.247
But like?

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:18.576
No, not like that!

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:22.295
What about you? Huh?

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:25.337
You seem to be fond of him.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:29.011
Fond, what are
you in a soap opera?

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.088
(laughing)

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.388
[Jamie] Taboo.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:36.059
Yeah, I love the
shit out of him.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.262
Oh, the easy road, huh?

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.062
(upbeat music)

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:46.066
[Cecile] It's going
to be so much fun!

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.608
Hey, thank you so much
for helping out today.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.024
My personal trainer.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.815
[David] It was my pleasure.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.442
I'm hurting, man.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.069
[David] You, okay,
you want to sit down here

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:14.566
and have a professional
look at it?

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.322
I'm so sore, I
must have tensed up.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.535
Come here.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.288
Let me have a look.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.623
[Joanna] It's
this one right here.

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:24.667
Hmm, it's your
lower neck muscle.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:26.912
That's what it's called?

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:30.624
It's actually called
the muscular trapezius.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.467
- Whoa.
- I think you're making that up.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.636
No, I'm not, I know
my muscles very well.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:35.469
Yeah?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.928
- Sorry, all right.
- Sorry, I got it.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:42.477
[David] There you
go, wow, you're tight.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.411
Don't stop.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.726
(soft moaning)

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.966
(serene music)

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.272
I bet this place
is really expensive,

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.059
and they're going to
try to rip us off.

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:39.067
Yeah, I'm not buying
anything so it's okay.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.741
Hey mate, how
much is this table?

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:43.658
No, no, no.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:46.908
(speaking foreign language)

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.529
Price? For this?

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.828
No, no, no.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:52.033
So it's not for sale?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.035
(speaking foreign language)

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:55.082
Don't worry about it.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.673
I wish they'd learn to
speak some bloody English,

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.591
I might actually buy something
if I knew how much it cost,

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.214
you know what I mean?

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.091
Hey-

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.896
[David] I brought
you some fruit.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.017
Thank you.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.318
Do you want to try
it, do you want me to

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:03.029
just give you a little?
- No, I'll just have some later.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:06.950
All right, then I'd
have to help myself then.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.946
That might be the best pineapple
I've ever had, try some.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.660
- Come on!
- No, I'm good thank you.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.287
[David] Tastes like an
orgasm in my mouth right now.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.038
Oh good.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.965
What are you doing?

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:26.966
Uh, I'm just getting
some work done.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.922
I've got a better idea.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:31.849
Why don't you put that down.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:32.968
No, no, please.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.391
And I can entertain
you a little bit.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.056
I've got this dance,
it's really good.

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.478
It's basically Chippendales
with Cirque du Soleil,

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:43.028
and a bit of Starlight Express,
I can do it in the room.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:44.396
No, thank you.

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.197
What, you don't
want to see my dance'?

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.986
I'm good.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.536
You are the first person to
turn me down, I'm devastated.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:55.866
I'm sorry, I just have to
do this for a little while.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:10:59.995
Hey-

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:05.800
You're beautiful.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:06.968
Thank, thanks.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:09.880
I'm sorry.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.973
You wanna go for a walk?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.227
I really don't feel like it.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:22.771
Okay-

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:25.066
You can go and I'll stay.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:30.200
All right, well,
I'll see you later?

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.276
Sure.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.127
I hope your work
goes well, all right.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.204
Thank you.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.467
Bye.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:56.017
(serene music)

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.870
Are you guys swimming?

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:25.877
You guys, I didn't
bring anything.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.294
[Miranda] What would you need?

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:31.674
<i>'</i> (Screaming)
- (giggling)

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.098
Come on!

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.432
It's warmer here, right?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:45.938
Back home it makes
your balls shrink.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:49.521
Yeah, yeah, the
water is pretty nice.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:54.442
Come on.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.736
What?

01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:57.571
Come on.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:02.038
Jamie, let's stay
here, they want to talk.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.916
(laughing)

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.348
Hey, what's up, what is it?

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.096
Nothing.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.143
Nothing?

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.488
That's all.

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:37.656
What did you do that for?

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:41.957
Now you don't have
to be mad at Joanna.

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:42.953
Okay-

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.004
All right, let's go.

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:45.887
[Miranda] So, what will
you miss most about Thailand?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:49.941
[Erik] Uhm, I'll miss walking
with sand under my feet.

01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:59.071
Uhm, having salt
water in my hair.

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:03.113
Mm, yeah, me too.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:07.246
And the people.

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.119
Us?

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.958
No.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:14.290
(laughing)

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.884
You're funny lately.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:24.513
Lately, wait, was
I boring before?

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:28.016
No, you were just
accidentally funny.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.066
Accidentally funny?

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.145
Like, you guys were
laughing at me?

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.150
Yeah, pretty much.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:50.209
You know, I might miss
you if you go home.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.319
I, I should just go to sleep.

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.693
Uhm...

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.699
Uhm, I could keep you company?

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.166
Okay, can we
just sleep though?

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:39.402
[David] Can't these
people be somewhere else?

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.364
You're in their
country, you know.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.738
I just want to be
on a deserted beach.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.873
Why do you think you're
entitled to everything?

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:53.707
I don't.

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:56.661
I just think they
should be thankful we're

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:59.497
in their country spending money.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:03.711
If they didn't have tourists
they'd probably die.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.931
Oh, hello. Hi!

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:13.303
Look at your little
bucket, it's so cute!

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:24.823
You're broody! Aren't you?

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.860
You do know I am
top level sperm.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.069
I could probably pop

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:31.404
one out if you'd like.
- Stop. Stop.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:35.329
They'd pay good
money for mine.

01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:41.377
Seriously, why do you want to
have a kid all of a sudden.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.957
It's so not like you.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.725
I think I need to leave.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:56.512
What?

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.566
I was just joking.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.321
Joanna!Joanna!

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.995
I don't know why you
still feel so guilty.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.750
Jesus, you're like a kid.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.922
So, I'm the kid?

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.374
I don't feel guilty,

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:29.004
it's just not like him
to be so out of touch.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.305
If you want to be with Erik,
why are you here with me?

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.803
Not now, David.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:36.935
Erik is fine.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.932
Listen, Erik was with a
girl at the Night Market.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.267
I saw him, okay, I saw them.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:51.359
Is this some kind of joke?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:56.038
No, I saw him, I
don't know who she was.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.406
[Joanna] Did you talk to him?

01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:59.037
No, I didn't even know
it was him at first,

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:00.910
he looked different,
he looked happy.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.287
And you didn't tell me.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.757
I was trying to protect
you, I was, you wanted space,

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:07.675
I gave you space.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:08.592
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:09.885
No, I'm not!

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.347
I don't know what
you want from me,

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.466
I'm trying to do
everything I can by you.

01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:17.843
Yeah, apart from being honest?

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.394
Was this all part of
your little plan to get

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:20.934
me to be with you?

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.314
Wait, what are you
talking about, little plan?

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:26.019
I didn't have a little
plan, you wanted this.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:28.354
I wasn't panning on
your choices, I swear.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:29.564
[Joanna] I wanted this?

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.566
Yes, you wanted this! Remember?

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:34.444
Do you remember, you came to me!

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:39.452
I like you.

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:44.290
Can't you see that?

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:47.582
I'd love for you to stay.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:29.673
I'm not gonna be your
girlfriend, you know.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:33.670
Oh, you're not going to be
any0ne's girlfriend, right?

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.015
But really, we're cool right?

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:39.884
Yeah.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.055
We're good?

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.307
- We're good.
- Good.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:46.683
I mean, we both needed
someone in the moment, I know.

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.859
Wait, what do you mean?

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.987
[Erik] Yeah, I mean, I
needed somebody, you needed

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.153
someone, it's just,
that's what it was, right?

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:57.527
No, no, no, I didn't
really need shit.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:02.324
What do you mean
needed somebody?

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:06.202
Why are you so upset?

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:09.581
No, I'm not upset,
I'm just, like,

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.667
you need to stop needing people.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.047
[Erik] I need to
stop needing people?

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.596
Yeah, it's like, I don't
think it's good for you anymore.

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:18.088
You can't, you can't
just say that I'm

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:20.299
some sort of comfort,
like what is that?

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.976
Well, it doesn't matter
what I think it was.

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:26.556
No, of course it matters
what you think it is.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.228
I should have seen this coming.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:29.934
No, stop, what do you
say, what do you mean?

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.769
No, no I, no I just
like fucked everything up,

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:33.737
I'm sorry, I thought you were
on the right track, and then...

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.948
Wait, what do you
mean the right track?

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:37.942
I, I'm sick and tired
of people complaining

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.035
about who I'm not, just
let me be who I am, okay?

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.826
It's not about being
on the right track.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.532
Well, then who are you,
what are you gonna be?

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.957
I don't know what
I'm going to be,

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:48.418
I don't, stop changing me, okay!

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.028
Where are you going?

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:20.409
This whole thing is my fault.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.362
It's nobody's fault.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.745
Joanna, you don't have to go.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.634
I knew this was a stupid idea.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.847
Me falling for a friend
that's really, really stupid.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.478
You know what, if you want
to go see your boyfriend

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:49.475
and his new girlfriend, go
for it, it's, it's fine.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.022
[Joanna] Why are
you being mean?

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:53.817
I'm, I'm not actually, I'm
just being completely honest.

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:55.941
[Joanna] Yeah,
like you were before?

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.150
I don't give much
for your honesty.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:58.823
I actually was
protecting you, but...

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:00.024
[Joanna] Yeah, you
were protecting me?

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:01.358
Yeah!

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:03.031
[Joanna] That's
bullshit, and you know it.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:05.988
You wanted it too, what...

01:24:10.504 --> 01:24:12.916
If you want to go see him,

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:16.715
he's going to be at the
Jomtien Party tonight.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:20.923
How do you know?

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.425
[David] He doesn't
want to be alone.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:27.055
He's with the girl.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:48.285
Just go, it's fine,
have a good time.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:49.578
I'm sorry.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.461
I'm sorry too.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:09.181
(foreboding music)

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:50.635
[Joanna] Okay, so I think you
might be a burlesque dancer.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.892
[Erik] Okay no, one
more you're gonna get it.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.691
One more, okay, I'm
gonna get it, okay.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.395
Ah, ah, it's so hard.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.651
Oh, Swedish chef?

01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:05.986
That's a bit stereotype.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:07.364
You know we don't
talk like that, right.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.991
No, I don't know, I haven't
heard you speak Swedish.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:12.119
- Okay, so just tell me then.
- I'm a writer.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:17.578
- Right.
- So that's what it is!

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.251
I'm glad we decided to meet.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:31.175
Me too, you're feeling better?

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.846
[Joanna] I wanted
to ask you something.

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:36.976
Okay-

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:39.058
[Cop] Hey you can't
be here this late!

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.309
- Shit.
- We can't be here?

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:42.398
No, it's too late,
we might get a ticket.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:43.521
[Erik] Oh, okay.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.072
(laughing)

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:50.800
Hi.

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:52.931
Hi.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:00.772
I'm sorry I yelled.

01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:05.111
Oh, uhm, you know what,
I'm kind of glad you did.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.659
You Okay?

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:16.367
Very, you?

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:24.080
Yup, always, always good.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:32.088
(calming music)

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.774
[Erik] Come on, guys,
look, look at the view!

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.611
Stop it. This is insane, guys!

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:51.072
Awesome.

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:54.860
Let's watch the sunset, right?

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:05.723
- (fireworks exploding)
- (party music)

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.746
(chattering)

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:28.212
(speaking foreign
language), beer please.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:31.874
Thank you man!
Thank you very much!

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:36.132
- (cheering)
- (laughing)

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.443
(speaking foreign language)

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:56.774
- (cheering)
<i>_</i> (applauding)

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:03.914
No, but it's great, like,
from what Cecile and Miranda's

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.953
been telling me, it's like,
a little bit more straight

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:08.706
forward here when you backpack,
and like, you, you just...

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:09.912
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, like?

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.917
You cut right to the chase.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:13.339
You know, when
this moment comes?

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:14.916
You're a dolphin,
you're a dolphin!

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:17.924
Yeah! But after two hours when
you realize this is bullshit

01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:19.922
and then it gives up, you
realize there's no way, I,

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:21.677
because I was driven out
by someone, I was left,

01:31:21.768 --> 01:31:23.679
so they had to stay and
spend the whole night,

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:27.434
and of course, (muttering)...

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:35.024
Pretty cool.

01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:37.106
I would have freaked out.

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.192
I don't know actually,
I might have just,

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.947
I might have been into that.

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:44.154
[Cecile] Really?

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.115
[Jamie] Three years, yeah!

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.665
[Miranda] It's really cute.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:48.955
[Jamie] Well, you're
all about extremes,

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.627
so that is kind of
down your alley.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.921
It's true, balls to the walls.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.460
I like a man who
calls me 53 times.

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:55.541
Excuse me guys.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:22.326
I'm sorry, I should have
told you that I was coming.

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:23.944
No, it's okay.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.208
Do you want to walk for a bit?

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:49.395
Our flight is the
day after tomorrow.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.146
Yeah, I know.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:05.319
So different seeing
you with these people.

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.654
Yeah, I guess it is different.

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:08.955
So, uhm,

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:14.290
that girl was your friend?

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.583
Miranda? Yeah.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:25.346
How's David?

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:32.600
I left David.

01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:44.612
I saw you at the Night Market.

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:53.038
Why didn't you come up to me?

01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:01.375
I don't know, I couldn't.

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:10.054
I shouldn't have
left you, I'm sorry.

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:12.682
(somber music)

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:24.398
Where's your bracelet?

01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:38.333
Can we go home
please, I need you.

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:44.126
I'm not, I'm not going
home Joanna, okay?

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:47.171
[Joanna] Are you
staying with her?

01:34:48.057 --> 01:34:49.468
I'm just staying.

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:55.220
Please come home with me!

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.985
I'm not done traveling yet.

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:17.083
Where are you supposed to go?

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:18.331
[Erik] I don't
know where I'm going.

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:19.582
You don't know
where you're going?

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:22.380
No, I don't know
where I'm going.

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:28.254
I can stay, we can travel,
we can, we can go to...

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:29.759
[Erik] Joanna.

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:35.890
Just ask me and I'll stay.

01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.604
Just ask me and I'll stay!

01:35:42.695 --> 01:35:45.062
(weeping)

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.868
[Erik] Hey, hey, are you okay?

01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:26.538
[Cecile] Will she be okay?

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:29.966
Yeah, she'll be
fine, I have no doubt.

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:34.630
(speaking foreign language)

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.265
If you change your
mind, come and find us.

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:47.392
Okay, I might.

01:37:47.487 --> 01:37:50.104
(calming music)

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:40.423
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)
