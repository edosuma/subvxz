02:19.240 --> 02:20.741
Hey, little mama, where you going?

02:20.774 --> 02:21.909
We finna go.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.305
Welcome to Saturday night at The Pynk,

04:31.338 --> 04:34.408
the finest shake joint
in all of Pussy Valley,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.877
right off exit 29 in the Dirty Delta,

04:36.910 --> 04:39.713
as fertile as the Nile.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.352
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

04:45.386 --> 04:48.422
Shake that, pop that, jiggle that fat ass!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.557
Let's go up in this bitch!

05:00.401 --> 05:03.637
And this nigga gonna say,
"Can I get some change?"

05:03.671 --> 05:06.440
- No.
- And I was like, "No, nigga, no."

05:06.473 --> 05:09.376
Ain't like my G-string
a motherfucking collection plate.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.511
Amen.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.080
And here I thought stripping
was a recession-proof industry.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.918
Bitch, how that pole burn, though?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.319
Better put some Neosporin on that bitch.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.055
Another scar on my pretty-ass legs.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.091
They gonna get you
with them pretty-ass legs.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.529
- Shit.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.797
What the hell?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.398
Customer put his fucking beer
on the stage,

05:31.432 --> 05:34.334
I do a monkey drop,
he end up busting me in my fucking head.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.903
You gonna need more than
some Neosporin for that.

05:35.936 --> 05:36.970
You gonna need some stitches.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.939
Mercedes, finish dancing my turn for me?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.108
My arms is tired.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.810
I'm liable to fly right off the pole
into the crowd.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.611
Mercedes, finish that girl turn.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.613
- Hell, why don't you do it?
- Because I just went out.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.915
I'll give you a blunt.

05:47.948 --> 05:52.920
Miss Mississippi, bring your black ass
back out on this stage right now.

05:52.953 --> 05:53.954
Right now.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.960
Bitch, you gonna owe me more than a blunt.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.598
Can I borrow your hairpiece?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.633
Y'all, it is money out there.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.139
Child, smell like
somebody that died up in here.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.151
First day back off maternity leave
and I get another fucking scar.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.954
Hair can cover this one.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.956
Floss can't cover that one.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.539
- That's that bud.
- $20, nigga.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.715
All right, it be 30, little mama.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.450
But that gentleman just paid 20.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.719
Yeah, well, that how much it cost
for a pretty bitch like you.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.788
That how you give compliments
round these here parts?

07:00.821 --> 07:03.157
That's just the politicking of The Pynk.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.658
Uncle Clifford rules.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.426
No funny money, no bullets,

07:06.460 --> 07:08.028
and no motherfucking chips.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.630
No chips?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.537
Look...

07:18.138 --> 07:21.041

07:24.044 --> 07:25.445
It's gonna be like that.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.750
Take your Rihanna-looking ass

Okay, you good.

Slipped again.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.009

08:29.042 --> 08:30.878

08:30.911 --> 08:32.913

08:45.792 --> 08:49.696

your wife where you was tonight.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.098

09:06.647 --> 09:09.616

09:09.650 --> 09:10.617
That's why he wobbling.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.940

13:00.881 --> 13:04.117
But come end of the month,

15:09.142 --> 15:11.544
Don't spend it all at the nail shop, now.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.686
What's a girl have to do to work here?

15:21.187 --> 15:24.491
I mean, do I need to fill out
a job application or something?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.559
Bitch, this ain't no damn Walmart.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.194
But there sure is a opening.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.131
Nice ass.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.199
Got a nice jiggle to it.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.421
I don't know why you suddenly start

But why now?

16:29.055 --> 16:32.092
Slow your roll, high yellow.
I ain't gone yet.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.360

We need your ten percent

17:51.337 --> 17:53.306
I say all right

17:53.339 --> 17:55.542
God needs your ten percent

17:55.575 --> 17:58.745
And the Lord will give you

17:58.778 --> 18:01.347
A blessing

Hallelujah

18:03.650 --> 18:06.653

18:08.721 --> 18:11.090
Hallelujah, come on

Come on and give Him praise, yeah

Come on, somebody

18:18.264 --> 18:21.634
Come on and magnify the Lord with me

18:21.668 --> 18:25.772

God loves a cheerful giver

18:37.617 --> 18:39.419
And we know when the pages go up

18:39.452 --> 18:41.154
The blessings come down

18:41.187 --> 18:43.356
But you can't get no blessings

18:43.389 --> 18:45.158
While you're still sitting down

18:45.191 --> 18:46.759
Come on, somebody

18:46.793 --> 18:48.595

A nigga roll up in here with a check,

20:49.782 --> 20:51.851
You made the bad check list
this month, Clifford.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.521
Y'all could have used
a cuter picture than that.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.624
I'll be sure to tell management
about your request.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.859
Look, just hold on to this till next week.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.260
I postdated.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.931
Ain't that fine establishment of yours
in need of some toilet paper?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.001
Who told you that,

21:08.034 --> 21:09.702
your husband?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.038
Cash or money order on this equity loan

21:12.271 --> 21:14.507
against the club
from here on out, Clifford.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.609
- And if I don't?
- Then you and your hoochie-coochie girls

21:16.643 --> 21:18.711
gonna have to post up somewhere else.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.784
Passport, please.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.920
See, these folks say
this ain't discriminating.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.556
Y'all all best come on down to The Pynk.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.059
I won't take $35 out your check

21:33.292 --> 21:35.662
to give you your motherfucking money.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.064
Más dineros, negritos.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.402
And some tequila for you, too, baby.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.974
Sucker.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.749
Five, six, seven, eight.

22:10.463 --> 22:14.567
This ish y'all doing right here
ain't gonna get y'all no crown.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.969
I mean, how y'all just gonna
let the Southaven Sizzles

22:17.003 --> 22:18.771
come and steal your trophy?

22:18.805 --> 22:19.706
I mean, how?

22:20.540 --> 22:21.941
I asked y'all a question.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.944
- I did my part!
- Shut up!

22:26.112 --> 22:28.848
If y'all don't learn nothing else from me,
y'all learn this.

22:28.881 --> 22:32.118
In this life,
you always got to go full out.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.986
Ain't no mark in this ish.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.057
Do it again, but before that,
give me 50 toe touches.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.029
One.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.897
Two.

22:44.931 --> 22:45.898
Three.

22:47.934 --> 22:51.938
Can't believe you got these girls
practicing on a Sunday afternoon, too.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.406
God don't mind,

22:53.439 --> 22:55.875
'cause thou shalt not lose
to the Southaven Sizzles.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.712
That girl done got too big
to be wearing shorts that short.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.380
Her mom all right with it.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.016
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

23:12.825 --> 23:16.629
Can't believe I even let you hide your
booty money in the church building fund.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.465
You sure weren't complaining when I put
that booty money in y'all account

23:19.499 --> 23:21.000
so y'all could apply for that loan.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.140
Well, you got your pulpit, and I got mine.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.583
You in a hole that deep
for a refinancing loan?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.986
- How you let it get that bad, man?
- Nigga, hush.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.554
We ain't never gonna be able
to keep the fridge on ice

23:41.587 --> 23:43.022
with Mercedes on her way out the door.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.658
Tell me something I don't know.

23:48.694 --> 23:49.695
Shit.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.199
All right, all right, all right.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.034
Everybody here?

23:56.702 --> 23:57.804
Where Keyshawn at?

23:57.837 --> 23:59.572
- She coming.
- She just text us.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.008
Bitch constantly be on CP time.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.076
Y'all let her know
I'm instituting some new rules

24:04.110 --> 24:06.045
for y'all hos starting tonight.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.480
The new stripper math:

24:07.513 --> 24:09.015
$4 off a lap dance,

24:09.048 --> 24:11.083
15% off the private rooms for the house.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.186
- The fuck?
- Stage work was always paid beforehand.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.521
Now that include tip-out, too.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.489
Come on.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.524
You really gonna have bitches
hitting the floor negative a Benjy?

24:18.558 --> 24:21.027
Hell, if bitches ain't skip out on tip-out
at the end of the night,

24:21.060 --> 24:23.663
maybe Uncle Clifford wouldn't have
to make y'all pay before.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.998
Me and my girl pocketbook
getting fucked up over here.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.534
Well, we'd all leave with more scrilla in
our pockets

24:28.568 --> 24:30.703
if y'all didn't make them weak-ass drinks.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.172
Mercedes, you be the main one.

24:33.206 --> 24:36.042
Always flodging like you
gonna come up off them duckets,

24:36.075 --> 24:38.878
and at the end of the night,
your ass ain't nowhere to be seen.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.080
- DJ Neva Scared know.
- Found the perfect property for you.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.549
- When you wanna see it?
- Cool all that nastiness down now.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.550
Cool down.

24:44.584 --> 24:48.487
Now, y'all know if it wasn't
for Mercedes Sundays,

24:48.521 --> 24:51.858
y'all hos wouldn't be ringing in nothing
but $20 each on a holy night.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.926
I don't know what y'all gonna do
without this Mississippi bread,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.729

24:56.762 --> 24:58.798
But I'ma pay what I owe y'all,

24:58.831 --> 25:03.236
'cause tonight this ass

25:03.269 --> 25:04.937
Maybe even some tetanus, too.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.152
I...

25:20.186 --> 25:21.587
I fell.

25:21.621 --> 25:25.191
Don't tell me it's corn bread
when I smell them biscuits burning.

25:26.559 --> 25:27.627
Are you all right?

25:27.660 --> 25:28.761
Bitch, what you think?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.267

25:36.135 --> 25:37.637

26:21.814 --> 26:23.349

26:24.350 --> 26:25.985

26:28.654 --> 26:30.623

26:30.656 --> 26:32.191
I ain't said nothing.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.360
Ain't said a word.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.996
How many you got by him?

26:38.597 --> 26:39.799

26:40.800 --> 26:42.868
The other one over with my mama now.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.372
He say he love me.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.812
Hey, I know that kind of love.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.281
It feel good 'cause
it make you feel something.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.149
Let you know you're living,

26:57.183 --> 26:59.819
even though living
ain't 'posed to feel that bad.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.054
Come on.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.224
You don't understand.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.692
How come I don't?

27:09.161 --> 27:11.931
Hell, I used to have a nigga
used to beat my ass.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.733

27:15.334 --> 27:18.738
That's till I poured a pot of hot grits
all over his ding-a-ling.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.175
Yes, ma'am, I had to Al Green his ass

27:23.943 --> 27:26.212

29:06.178 --> 29:07.379

29:45.551 --> 29:47.353

arranging flowers or some shit?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.101
Fuck you.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.371

Now, you go on and be

34:47.386 --> 34:48.787
You know, I can take care of that.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.859
Many folks you killed over there,

34:54.092 --> 34:56.595

on that conscience of yours.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.831
Well, it's better his than yours.

Y'all wasn't ready for all that.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.402
Yeah, yeah!

37:25.911 --> 37:29.581
Hey, girl, hey!

37:29.615 --> 37:31.650
Seem like you got your lap full

37:31.683 --> 37:34.353
No, my lap big enough
to accompany all that there.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.320
Well, if I'm gonna twerk it,

37:35.354 --> 37:37.623
you gonna have to make this G-string

37:38.690 --> 37:40.025
I like your consonance.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.327

37:43.862 --> 37:45.864
Hey, fuck with your boy for a minute.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.866
I got a Louis duffel full
of coochie coupons, you heard?

37:56.575 --> 38:00.679
That duffel could hold eight stacks,
but you ain't got nothing but five.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.982
With them floral arrangement
bricks up in there, it's hard to tell.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.851
- Hell, I don't--
- Okay, okay.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.052
So it's, like, five stacks, then.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.720
Four.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.356
You just wasted a G
on these hos perpetrating.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.825
Damn, bitch. You's a OG for real.

What your name is, partner?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.361

38:16.395 --> 38:19.398
Hottest rapper out in these
streets right about now.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.066
Little Murder, huh?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.869
Is we spending four stacks
on a lap dance tonight,

38:23.902 --> 38:26.571
or you got something else in mind?

38:26.605 --> 38:28.774
- Something else.
- Keep talking.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.410
This champagne room busy,
you know what I'm saying?

38:32.077 --> 38:34.413
Who that guy getting it
right there, though?

38:35.080 --> 38:36.014
Nobody.

38:36.048 --> 38:39.084
No, player, that's like Beyoncé cousin
with that blue dress on.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.819
Hey, now, that's a good metaphor.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.587
Write that shit down.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.325
Guess I'm gonna have to swing
my stacks thataway, then.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.427
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.761
You say you got four stacks, huh?

38:50.595 --> 38:51.463
Let me see.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.066
Okay.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.367
Tell you what.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.769
I pull in for your boy over there,

38:57.803 --> 39:00.739
but you give us all your coochie coupons.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.075
- Double the trouble!
- Bet.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.115
If you ain't laying down no ones
that'll keep that electric on,

39:10.348 --> 39:12.951
you best move along, brown Fubu T-shirt.

39:15.053 --> 39:18.457
So I got a customer
want you and me in VIP.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.358
You down?

39:20.392 --> 39:21.126
VIP?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.428
That's not what Uncle Clifford said.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.696
The way you getting down up in twerk town,

39:24.730 --> 39:26.631
you gonna have to come up
off of these training wheels.

39:26.665 --> 39:29.668
Besides, I got a nigga
willing to pay two stacks,

39:29.701 --> 39:31.703
a G for me and a G for you.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.505
A G, huh?

39:33.538 --> 39:37.142
Girl, that's double what niggas throwing
down nowadays in the champagne room.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.579
Besides, you need to learn
how to handle VIP.

39:40.612 --> 39:44.683
And who better to learn from
than a OG like me?

40:13.745 --> 40:16.648
Getting creamy up
in this bitch right here!

40:16.681 --> 40:18.717
It's getting creamy!

40:18.750 --> 40:20.852
Goddamn, man!

40:20.886 --> 40:23.155
Redbone. Redbone, look my way.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.423
Look my way!

40:25.457 --> 40:27.659
I said look my way!

40:27.692 --> 40:30.195
Hey! Don't make me have to wrap
a nigga balls round his neck.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.664
Don't touch them unless they touch you.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.533
It's all copacetic in the cut, Diamond.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.606
Look, you gonna have to calm down
drunk as fuck over there.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.742
Nigga, you doing the most right now.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.913
- She's straight?
- Yeah, she straight.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.084
I see why they call you Little Murder.

40:53.718 --> 40:56.688
You ain't seen nothing yet
till I take you to the next level.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.023
You know what I'm saying?

40:58.056 --> 40:59.724
That's the Paradise Room.

41:01.927 --> 41:05.197
That's only for private, private parties.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.765
Well, if you want more,

41:06.798 --> 41:09.067
there's something I'ma need
to put on you in private.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.071
Autumn...

41:14.072 --> 41:15.841
...be right back.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.577
Finna take my man
over to the Mercedes room.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.613
Y'all take good care of my sis, now.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.620
I'll be back.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.777
No, dog. My booty can't bump to this.

41:52.811 --> 41:53.845
What you mean?

41:53.879 --> 41:55.680
Ain't got enough tremolo, ask me.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.749
And these lyrics, though?

41:57.782 --> 41:59.718
I mean, is you rappin' in cursive or what?

41:59.751 --> 42:01.653
Bitch, this trap reggae soul.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.188
This slaw, what it is.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.056
You ain't pinning this shit
on my badonkadonk.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.092
- Then fuck all my stacks, then.
- That's fine.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.794
Who needs your money when a bitch got
some artistic integrity?

42:19.871 --> 42:21.673
You're the bad one of the bunch, I see.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.309
Halfway right but mostly sweet, though.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.845
Like this neck of yours.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.247
Come on, shorty. Stop acting all uptight.

42:29.281 --> 42:31.116
Drink some of this champagne with me.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.018
You mean sparkling wine?

42:35.153 --> 42:36.054
What?

42:36.087 --> 42:37.555
Redbone, you think you
better than us, huh?

42:37.589 --> 42:38.823
Hey, hey, I didn't--

42:38.857 --> 42:39.891
Then don't be getting
all saditty on a nigga.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.059
Please, let go of me!

42:41.092 --> 42:42.794
Yo, Pico, what the fuck?

42:43.695 --> 42:44.863
Shit!

42:46.097 --> 42:47.165
Damn!

42:49.701 --> 42:51.970
Hey, hey, hey, get up off my nigga, man!

42:52.003 --> 42:53.972
You want to do things the hard way, huh?

42:54.005 --> 42:55.840
That's one way to VIP.

42:59.311 --> 43:01.880
Damn, nigga,
watch where you putting them boats.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.782
My bad, nigga. I'm looking for that bitch.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.317
Which bitch? Which one?

43:05.350 --> 43:06.952
The redbone with the white tank on.

43:06.985 --> 43:08.053
- We ain't mean to offend her.
- What?

43:08.086 --> 43:10.288
- Nigga, what?
- I said we ain't mean to offend her.

43:10.322 --> 43:13.024
- Nigga, what?
- I said we ain't mean to offend her!

43:19.297 --> 43:21.032
Come on over here.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.635
Now, say what you said.

43:23.668 --> 43:25.704
Damn!

43:26.671 --> 43:30.008
This room on some Super Mario
save the princess type shit.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.910
Nigga, what you know about
some save the princess?

43:31.943 --> 43:33.144
That's before your time.

43:33.178 --> 43:34.212
I'm a old soul.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.614
And what was you saying?

43:36.648 --> 43:38.350
Shit got kind of hectic up in VIP.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.685
I wanted to apologize to little shorty.

43:40.719 --> 43:41.720
Well, she gonna have to get used to it,

43:41.753 --> 43:43.288
learn how to handle herself
if she want to work for me.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.191
So you the manager round here.

43:46.224 --> 43:48.360
I found me the man I need to complain to.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.996
Wo-man.

43:51.029 --> 43:53.331
Besides, what you got
to be complaining about?

43:53.365 --> 43:56.134
The Pynk got everything that a man need.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.770
We got white bitches, redbone bitches,

43:58.803 --> 44:01.306
high yellow bitches,
midnight blue bitches,

44:01.339 --> 44:04.109
molly, hot wings,
Tums after the hot wings.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.412
Seem like The Pynk got everything
but the one thing I really need.

44:11.916 --> 44:13.785
This little nigga trying to make me blush.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.258
Don't make me fall the fuck out.

44:23.261 --> 44:25.864
Well, I lays motherfuckers out.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.732
That's why they call me Little Murder.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.200
That your government name?

44:29.234 --> 44:30.702
It's my rap name.

44:30.735 --> 44:32.737
So you just be...

44:32.771 --> 44:35.106
doing little murders
as opposed to big murders?

44:35.840 --> 44:37.742
I buys them all, baby.

44:37.776 --> 44:38.710
Is that right?

44:38.743 --> 44:42.380
In fact, I got something
that'll murder you.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.309
- You all right?
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?

45:12.310 --> 45:14.779
Wait a minute.
Are you taking pictures of me?

45:14.813 --> 45:15.747
No, no.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.382
I do real estate.

45:18.149 --> 45:20.285
Stupid me, I didn't take all the pictures
I needed to earlier

45:20.318 --> 45:21.753
for a meeting with a client.

45:21.786 --> 45:23.988
Hey, you all right?

45:26.024 --> 45:26.991
Yeah.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.228
Yeah, yeah.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.497
Just needed some air.
Gets stuffy in there.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.033
I couldn't breathe.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.167
The smoke?

45:37.102 --> 45:38.369
Actually, you got one?

45:39.237 --> 45:40.238
No.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.175
What's your vice, then?

45:45.243 --> 45:46.244
Don't got one.

45:49.214 --> 45:51.116
Can't trust a man without a vice.

45:51.149 --> 45:53.017
We all need to give in to something.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.122
True that.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.060
Andre.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.194
Andre Watkins.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.269
They call me Autumn Night.

46:12.537 --> 46:15.039
- Sounds all poetic and...
- All poetic and shit.

46:21.513 --> 46:26.050
I'm sorry I was so abrasive just then.

46:27.185 --> 46:28.920
I just got a little shook.

46:28.953 --> 46:32.290
Can only imagine what you got to shake off
working up in there.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.096
Your client's a vampire.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.398
They got you out here
taking pictures after midnight.

46:42.066 --> 46:43.234
No.

46:44.335 --> 46:47.405
It's just that during the day,
this place goes ghost.

46:48.573 --> 46:52.577
But at night, the spots round here,
they start poppin'.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.512
Client just couldn't believe.

46:54.546 --> 46:56.281
Let me see.

47:13.431 --> 47:14.966
You got a good eye.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.169
That I do.

47:28.179 --> 47:31.616
Well, you ain't seen poppin'...

47:32.617 --> 47:34.152
...until you come inside.

47:34.185 --> 47:36.087
You coming in?

47:36.120 --> 47:37.989
You trying to give me a vice?

47:38.022 --> 47:40.925
Why? You want one?

47:44.062 --> 47:45.029
No.

47:45.063 --> 47:47.498
No, no, I'ma head on back.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.201
But it was a pleasure meeting you, Autumn.

47:51.936 --> 47:53.104
Actually...

47:55.473 --> 47:56.941
...it's Hailey.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.878
- That's my name.
- Nice.

48:02.313 --> 48:04.282
Well, good night, Hailey.

48:20.632 --> 48:22.367
Everybody ready?

48:22.400 --> 48:25.670
I said are you ready?

48:27.272 --> 48:30.975
I know brown Fubu T-shirt over there
readier than a motherfucker, man.

48:31.009 --> 48:34.178
Thirsty-ass big forces there,
big-head nigga!

48:35.246 --> 48:36.648
With your bald head.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.249
But y'all better get ready,

48:38.283 --> 48:41.052
'cause Mercedes about to pop that ass
for that cash.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.186
You know what I'm saying?

48:44.922 --> 48:47.091
- I need you to play this.
- This Mercedes-approved?

48:47.125 --> 48:49.460
I thought you was DJ Neva Scared.

48:56.167 --> 49:00.138
Now, here every nigga favorite night
of the week at The Pynk!

49:01.339 --> 49:02.974
Throw them Benjies up in the air

49:03.007 --> 49:06.110
for the most luxurious booty
round these parts.

49:08.579 --> 49:11.249
She a hood celebrity, y'all.

49:11.282 --> 49:16.287
Welcome to Mercedes Sunday!

49:28.700 --> 49:31.469
Rewind!

50:16.013 --> 50:17.415
I need y'all to say this with me now.

50:18.116 --> 50:19.517
Mercedes!

50:20.351 --> 50:21.652
- Mercedes.
- What?

50:21.686 --> 50:23.388
Mercedes.

50:23.421 --> 50:25.523
Fuck it up, fuck it up, Mercedes.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.458
Fuck it up, fuck it up, Mercedes.

50:27.492 --> 50:29.427
Fuck it up, fuck it up, Mercedes.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.195
Fuck it up, fuck it up, Mercedes.

50:31.229 --> 50:33.164
Fuck it up, fuck it up, Mercedes.

50:57.155 --> 50:58.689
Come on, now! Come on!

51:03.294 --> 51:05.396
Lit up in this motherfucker.

51:05.430 --> 51:07.465
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.829
Mercedes!

51:37.862 --> 51:38.830
Wait.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.233
Why you didn't tell me you
was coming tonight, Ma?

51:42.266 --> 51:44.402
- You know I don't like surprises.
- They love you.

51:44.435 --> 51:47.738
Folks was willing to give up their rent
and car note for you.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.108
I didn't know you made that kind of money.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.511
Well, tonight was a good night.

51:54.712 --> 51:56.147
What you think?

51:56.180 --> 51:58.883
I mean, I see how you
manage your abundance.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.586
You always said I was blessed
and highly favored.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.120
Thank you, Jesus.

52:03.154 --> 52:05.756
- Where did I go wrong, Mercedes?
- Mama, don't start this shit again.

52:05.790 --> 52:08.392
Why has my God forsaken me?

52:09.227 --> 52:12.763
He must be so mad at me
to have given me a ho for a daughter.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.499
Heifer, I ain't never been no ho.

52:14.532 --> 52:16.801
Your body is a temple, Mercedes.

52:16.834 --> 52:19.136
- Didn't I teach you that?
- You sure did.

52:19.170 --> 52:20.605
That's why when I was a young un,

52:20.638 --> 52:23.374
you sent me over to bend my temple over
in front of them niggas

52:23.407 --> 52:25.276
to get them to buy our breakfast
at the Waffle House.

52:25.309 --> 52:27.778
- I ain't know the Lord then.
- Bitch, you barely know Him now.

52:27.812 --> 52:30.414
- Stripping is blasphemous.
- No, Ma.

52:30.448 --> 52:33.451
It art. I transport motherfuckers.

52:33.484 --> 52:35.553
Dazzle them,
something you wish you could do.

52:35.586 --> 52:38.856
Oh, Mercedes, this ain't gonna get you
through the gates of heaven.

52:38.890 --> 52:40.925
Well, I heard hell hella lit, though.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.862
With all this,

52:44.896 --> 52:48.699
church should have been getting
double the tithes and offering,

52:48.733 --> 52:53.371
with all the money I seen these heathens
waste on you tonight.

52:56.407 --> 52:58.442
So you think I'm a waste?

52:58.476 --> 53:00.678
You're not a waste, Mercedes.

53:00.711 --> 53:03.681
But this is a waste
of time and your talent.

53:03.714 --> 53:05.316
You think I'm doing this for nothing?

53:05.349 --> 53:09.253
You ain't been doing shit
but breaking my heart!

53:09.287 --> 53:10.288
Oh, Lord!

53:11.956 --> 53:13.591
This all my fault.

53:15.293 --> 53:19.597
With everything I done done,
I deserve this.

53:19.630 --> 53:23.601
Put her sins on me, Lord,
'cause I can carry 'em.

53:23.634 --> 53:26.571
For her and for me,

53:26.604 --> 53:29.473
and I don't care
if I have to die as a sacrifice

53:29.507 --> 53:31.809
for this daughter of mine.

53:31.842 --> 53:34.812
I will do everything
in my power to save her.

53:34.845 --> 53:39.550
Save her, oh, dear Lord!
Save her! Save this ho!

53:39.584 --> 53:41.852
Save her, Lord! Save her! Save her, Lord!

53:41.886 --> 53:44.322
Save her! Save this...

53:48.426 --> 53:50.828
God is always grateful for an offering.

53:52.396 --> 53:56.000
But He'd be even more grateful
for your repentance.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.605
The cash all I got to give tonight.

54:41.646 --> 54:44.015

54:44.048 --> 54:45.983

54:46.017 --> 54:49.553

bottle girls of yourn.

54:50.354 --> 54:52.023

54:52.056 --> 54:54.625

something real nice

54:56.727 --> 54:59.063
to have you slip that shit in on a bitch.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.731
You better talk to your boss about that.

55:00.765 --> 55:02.566

55:08.472 --> 55:09.640

55:27.058 --> 55:28.592

55:31.062 --> 55:33.464

55:33.497 --> 55:34.532

55:52.783 --> 55:55.519

on the lap dance tip.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.489

and lazy, I don't know.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.527
She ain't do nothing
but lay up there looking light.

56:03.561 --> 56:05.496
Well, that's what yellow bitches do.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.665

56:07.698 --> 56:09.533

57:15.132 --> 57:16.867

57:17.701 --> 57:19.970

before I head on home.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.812
Home? Where's home?

58:03.681 --> 58:04.682
