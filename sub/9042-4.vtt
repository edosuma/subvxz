WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:07.167
- HEY, NO, KIDS, YOU'RE GETTING
MARKER ON THE TABLE.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.033
RAY, DO SOMETHING.

00:09.033 --> 00:11.500
- DON'T MARK THE TABLE, KIDS.

00:14.633 --> 00:15.733
- HERE, KIDS.

00:15.733 --> 00:17.500
WE'LL USE THIS NEWSPAPER
AS YOUR MAT.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.633
- HEY, COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.700
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I WAS READING SOMETHING

00:24.700 --> 00:27.867
THAT THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES SAID.

00:27.867 --> 00:31.200
- YEAH, WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT
SAY TO MARMADUKE?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.733
- "TELL YOUR WIFE
TO LIGHTEN UP."

00:38.233 --> 00:40.133
- HEY.
- HEY, ROBERT.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.433
- HEY, KIDS.

00:41.433 --> 00:44.200
- HI.
- HI, UNCLE ROBERT.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.633
- I DREW A PICTURE OF YOU,
UNCLE ROBERT.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.200
- OH!

00:48.200 --> 00:50.200
- AND THAT'S MOMMY
IN THE PICTURE TOO.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.700
- OH, GREAT.
AND WHERE IS YOUR DAD?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.767
- I DIDN'T DRAW HIM.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.167
- MAY I KEEP THIS?

00:59.367 --> 01:00.767
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY'RE NOT DONE YET.

01:00.767 --> 01:04.100
THEY STILL GOT TO DRAW
THE BOLTS IN YOUR NECK.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.800
- NOW, THAT,RAYMOND,
IS NOT NICE,

01:15.800 --> 01:18.700
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE NOT IN THE PICTURE.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.767
WHAT IS THIS?

01:21.767 --> 01:23.500
"AS WE HONOR
FRANK BARONE'S MEMORY,

01:23.500 --> 01:26.033
"WE SHOULD ALSO BE HONEST
ABOUT WHO HE WAS IN LIFE,

01:26.033 --> 01:29.367
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN TELLING IT LIKE IT IS."

01:30.733 --> 01:33.267
- THAT'S ON THE BACK
OF YOUR PICTURE?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.900
MICHAEL, WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT PAPER?

01:34.900 --> 01:38.333
- FROM DADDY'S OFFICE.

01:38.333 --> 01:41.067
- "WHO HE WAS IN LIFE...
HONOR FRANK BARONE'S MEMORY..."

01:41.067 --> 01:42.933
THIS SOUNDS LIKE HE'S...

01:42.933 --> 01:44.400
PASSED ON.

01:50.967 --> 01:53.100
- MICHAEL, WHY WOULD YOU
WRITE THIS?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.767
[upbeat rock music]

01:58.767 --> 02:00.333
- [singing] JUNGLE LOVE

02:00.333 --> 02:01.533
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:01.533 --> 02:05.100
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:05.100 --> 02:06.833
JUNGLE LOVE

02:06.833 --> 02:08.200
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:08.200 --> 02:11.600
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:11.600 --> 02:13.067
JUNGLE LOVE

02:13.067 --> 02:14.933
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:14.933 --> 02:18.000
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:18.000 --> 02:19.733
JUNGLE LOVE

02:19.733 --> 02:21.167
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:21.167 --> 02:24.767
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY

02:29.933 --> 02:31.567
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT, MAN?

02:31.567 --> 02:33.100
- IT'S NOTHING.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.267
LOOK, SOMETIMES
WHEN A SPORTS STAR DIES,

02:36.267 --> 02:39.733
I WRITE A COLUMN THAT'S LIKE
AN APPRECIATION FOR HIM.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.467
- OH, I SEE, OKAY.
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

02:42.467 --> 02:45.300
EXCEPT DAD ISN'T
A DEAD SPORTS STAR.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.800
UNLESS HE GOT REALLY GOOD
AT HOCKEY THIS MORNING

02:48.800 --> 02:51.200
AND THEN YOU KILLED HIM.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.900
- LOOK, I WAS WRITING
A REAL APPRECIATION

02:53.900 --> 02:55.600
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,
AND I--

02:55.600 --> 02:57.133
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST HAD SOME THOUGHTS

02:57.133 --> 02:59.267
ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY
FOR DAD.

02:59.267 --> 03:02.000
- AN APPRECIATION
OF YOUR FATHER.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.400
REALLY?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.067
- AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW?

03:06.067 --> 03:09.233
WHY WOULD YOU JUST ASSUME THAT
YOU GET TO DO THE EULOGY, HUH?

03:09.233 --> 03:10.700
WHAT'S GONNA BE MY JOB
AT THE FUNERAL,

03:10.700 --> 03:14.033
KEEPING YOUR SCREAMING FANS
OFF THE STAGE?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.600
- IT'S NOT--

03:20.600 --> 03:22.733
IT'S NOT A EULOGY.
I JOTTED A FEW THINGS DOWN.

03:22.733 --> 03:26.167
- OH, JOTTED.
YOU JOTTED,DID YOU?

03:26.167 --> 03:28.500
THERE'S, LIKE, EIGHT PARAGRAPHS
RIGHT HERE.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.567
- HEY, I'M A PROFESSIONAL
WRITER, REMEMBER, OKAY?

03:30.567 --> 03:32.567
FOR ME,
THIS IS LIKE DOODLING.

03:32.567 --> 03:35.033
IN FACT,
I WROTE MORE THAN THIS.

03:35.033 --> 03:38.167
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:38.167 --> 03:40.000
HEY, GUYS.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.167
GUYS, IS THIS ALL
THAT YOU DREW?

03:42.167 --> 03:43.567
- NO, WE DREW A LOT.
- REALLY?

03:43.567 --> 03:45.433
- GOOD, GREAT.
WHERE ARE THE OTHER PICTURES?

03:45.433 --> 03:46.700
- WE GAVE THEM TO GRANDMA.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.100
- NO!

03:54.533 --> 03:56.467
- DADDY'S WEIRD.

04:04.367 --> 04:05.367
- OH.

04:05.367 --> 04:08.033
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HEY.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.800
HELLO.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.333
HEY, UH,
HOW'S EVERYBODY?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.500
- GOOD.
ARE YOU HUNGRY, DEAR?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.300
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I'M OKAY.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.500
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.300
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GET IT.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.400
- NO, YOU DO ENOUGH OF THAT
AT HOME--SIT DOWN.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.433
- NO, LET ME SEE
WHAT'S IN THE FRIGIDAIRE.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.967
- NO, I'LL GET IT,
I'LL GET IT, I'LL GET IT.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.567
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO EAT, RAYMOND?

04:29.567 --> 04:31.733
OH, I GOT LASAGNA.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.967
- WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

04:35.967 --> 04:38.300
- I GOT HAM.
OOH, DELICIOUS.

04:38.300 --> 04:41.433
I PUT A GLAZE
OF PINEAPPLE ON IT.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.400
OKAY.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.267
- YOU GOT ANY FROZEN TREATS?

04:50.267 --> 04:53.067
- YEAH, I GOT
SOME FUDGE POPS.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.100
- MA, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I GOT TO GO.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.867
I GOT TO PUT THE THING
IN THE THING.

05:04.867 --> 05:08.567
- HEY, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THOSE?

05:08.567 --> 05:10.100
- OH, YEAH.
THESE ARE THE KIDS' PICTURES.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.300
I JUST--I'M GONNA
FRAME THEM ALL.

05:13.300 --> 05:16.100
- THAT CHICKEN SCRATCH?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.433
WHAT DOES IT SAY
TO YOUR CHILDREN

05:17.433 --> 05:20.233
IF YOU FRAME
EVEN THEIR WORST CRAP?

05:22.133 --> 05:25.000
- IT SAYS YOU LOVE THEM.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.467
- NO, IT SAYS YOU LOVE CRAP.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.367
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.433
- HEY, HOLD ON.
YOU CAN'T TAKE THOSE.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.367
- WHAT? WHY NOT?
YOU JUST SAID THEY WERE CRAP.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.267
- WELL, YES, I DID,

05:37.267 --> 05:40.367
BUT THEY'RE MYCRAP.

05:40.367 --> 05:41.767
I'M WATCHING THE GAME.

05:41.767 --> 05:44.333
- OKAY.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.800
- YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA
WATCH THE GAME WITH DAD.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.733
- HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

05:48.733 --> 05:50.033
- WHAT?

05:50.033 --> 05:52.633
- THE PICTURE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.867
- WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

05:54.867 --> 05:57.200
- THE ONE WITH YOUR FATHER'S
EULOGY ON THE BACK.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.767
- OHH, MA!
DID HE SEE IT?

05:59.767 --> 06:02.233
- OF COURSE NOT!

06:02.233 --> 06:05.033
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S--
IT'S AWFUL

06:05.033 --> 06:07.500
AND IT'S MORBID
AND IT'S WEIRD.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.767
- UH-HUH.
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

06:10.767 --> 06:13.233
- WHERE'S MINE?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.567
- WHAT?

06:17.567 --> 06:19.800
- YOU WROTE A TRIBUTE
FOR YOUR FATHER.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.567
WHERE'S MINE?

06:21.567 --> 06:24.033
- IT'S NOT A TRIBUTE.
IT'S JUST--

06:24.033 --> 06:25.367
I DOODLED A COUPLE THINGS.

06:25.367 --> 06:26.800
THAT'S ALL.
IT'S NOTHING.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.300
- UH-HUH.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.033
SO I DON'T GET ONE.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.700
- MA, THIS IS A EULOGY.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.133
I DIDN'T WRITE YOURS
BECAUSE...

06:35.133 --> 06:38.967
BECAUSE EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT
WOULD MAKE ME TOO, TOO SAD.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.767
- OHH-H-H.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.333
OH, YOU'RE SWEET.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.100
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING
BY WEDNESDAY.

06:53.233 --> 06:54.533
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

06:54.533 --> 06:56.400
SHE WANTS ME TO WRITE
HEREULOGY NOW.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.533
- RAY, SHE'S GONNA WANT YOU
IN THE COFFIN WITH HER.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.400
- YEAH, WELL, I'D RATHER
NOT DO THAT EITHER.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.200
- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO WRITE
YOUR FATHER'S EULOGY?

07:10.200 --> 07:13.067
- WHAT?
IT'S LIKE A WRITING CHALLENGE.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.567
- A CHALLENGE?
- YEAH.

07:15.567 --> 07:19.700
HOW DO YOU MAKE PEOPLE
MISS THAT GUY?

07:20.800 --> 07:24.300
SEE, IT'S ALL ABOUT--

07:24.300 --> 07:26.800
WELL, I MEAN, THIS IS KIND OF
TECHNICAL WRITER STUFF.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.100
- NO, TRY ME.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.600
- OKAY.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.700
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT
MY FATHER IS, WELL, A JERK.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.967
- HOW TECHNICAL.

07:35.967 --> 07:40.233
- SO YOU START BY TALKING
ABOUT HIS JERK-LIKE QUALITIES,

07:40.233 --> 07:41.900
WHICH EVERYONE AGREES WITH,

07:41.900 --> 07:44.167
BUT ALSO MAKES 'EM
FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY,

07:44.167 --> 07:46.500
BECAUSE HE'S LYING THERE
DEAD AND ALL.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.667
AND THAT'S WHEN I HIT THEM
WITH AN EXAMPLE

07:48.667 --> 07:50.400
OF HIM BEING SWEET.

07:50.400 --> 07:55.067
AND THEN IT'S, "BOO-HOO.
FRANK, WE HARDLY KNEW YE."

07:59.367 --> 08:02.400
- AND THAT EXAMPLE
OF SWEET IS?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.933
- YOU THINK I DON'T GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

08:04.933 --> 08:07.400
WHEN ROBERT AND I WERE KIDS,
WE HAD THIS BUNNY

08:07.400 --> 08:10.000
WE KEPT IN A CAGE
IN THE BACK.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.533
I NAMED HIM HOPPY.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.733
- HOPPY?

08:12.733 --> 08:14.667
- I'M A WRITER.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.800
ANYWAY...

08:17.800 --> 08:21.600
MY DAD, HE ALWAYS
TOLD ME HE HATED HIM.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.000
BUT THEN ONE DAY,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.500
I COME DOWN
TO GET SOME JUICE,

08:25.500 --> 08:28.667
AND I GO IN THE KITCHEN
AND I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW,

08:28.667 --> 08:29.933
AND I SEE HIM THERE.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.700
AND HE'S GOT THE CAGE OPEN,

08:31.700 --> 08:35.967
AND HE'S SITTING DOWN
NEXT TO IT, PETTING HOPPY.

08:35.967 --> 08:38.733
HE WAS--
HE WAS BEING ALL...

08:38.733 --> 08:41.367
GENTLE.

08:41.367 --> 08:43.700
SO I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST...

08:43.700 --> 08:45.900
SOMETHING ABOUT
SEEING HIM LIKE THAT,

08:45.900 --> 08:49.367
IT JUST STAYED WITH ME.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.867
I DON'T KNOW;
I GUESS I JUST LIKE

08:50.867 --> 08:53.333
THINKING ABOUT HIM
LIKE THAT.

08:55.233 --> 08:58.367
SEE?
I TOLD YOU IT'S GOOD STUFF!

09:01.800 --> 09:04.400
- THAT'S SO SAD.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.533
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
IN A EULOGY.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.700
GUY'S DEAD.

09:14.300 --> 09:18.633
- NO, IT'S SAD BECAUSE,
WHAT, IT'S BEEN 35 YEARS?

09:18.633 --> 09:20.567
YOU--YOU NEVER
TOLD HIM THIS, DID YOU?

09:20.567 --> 09:23.267
- TOLD HIM WHAT,
ABOUT PETTING THE BUNNY?

09:23.267 --> 09:25.833
- YEAH, YOU GOT TO TELL HIM
THAT YOU SAW HIM

09:25.833 --> 09:28.267
AND HOW IT MADE YOU FEEL.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.300
- ARE YOU NEW HERE?

09:38.567 --> 09:40.833
- RAY, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THIS.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.433
- NO, I'M NOT!

09:42.433 --> 09:44.433
- SO THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
COULD HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION

09:44.433 --> 09:46.200
WITH YOUR FATHER
IS IF HE'S DEAD.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.333
- SO YOU SEE MY PROBLEM.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.300
HEY, THE KIDS
MARKED THE TABLE.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.267
- I WON THE LOTTERY--
20 BUCKS.

10:05.267 --> 10:06.467
- CONGRATULATIONS, FRANK.

10:06.467 --> 10:07.933
- YEAH, "CONGRATULATIONS."

10:07.933 --> 10:09.367
THAT'S WHAT A PERSONSAYS,

10:09.367 --> 10:11.400
NOT WHAT THE BANSHEE
OVER THERE SAYS.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.100
"I TOLD YOU NOT TO BUY
THOSE THINGS AT THE DRUGSTORE.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.100
WHERE'S MY PRESCRIPTION?"

10:19.033 --> 10:20.833
- YOU DIDN'T GET
HER PRESCRIPTION?

10:20.833 --> 10:23.167
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.133
LOOK, I WON.
I REINVESTED IT.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.733
I ALREADY SCRATCHED FIVE,
BUT I'M HAVING A BUM STREAK.

10:29.733 --> 10:31.067
I NEED TO CHANGE UP.

10:31.067 --> 10:33.533
HERE, YOU SCRATCH.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.867
- I GET A CUT, RIGHT?

10:35.867 --> 10:37.533
- 10%.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.467
BUT IF WE WIN BIG,
NO ONE TELLS YOUR MOTHER

10:39.467 --> 10:42.600
TILL I'M IN RIO
WITH HARRIET LICHTMAN.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.533
- TAKE RAY WITH YOU.
HE LIKES HARRIET LICHTMAN.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.867
- AW...NOTHING.

10:52.867 --> 10:55.933
- NOTHING.
- NOTHING.

10:55.933 --> 10:57.233
- AW, IT'S RIGGED.

10:57.233 --> 10:59.667
STUPID NEW YORK STATE HUMPS.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.933
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.467
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA WIN,
THEN YOU DON'T.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.600
THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.267
[clears throat]

11:29.167 --> 11:30.500
HEY, DAD, REMEMBER--

11:30.500 --> 11:32.967
REMEMBER THAT BUNNY
THAT ME AND ROBERT HAD?

11:32.967 --> 11:36.167
- SURE.
THAT THING STANK.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.767
- I THINK I NAMED IT HOPPY.

11:37.767 --> 11:40.300
- I HATED IT.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.133
- IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW.
IT'S SILLY--

11:42.133 --> 11:44.433
I THINK I SAW YOU
PETTING HIM ONCE.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.167
- WHAT?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.067
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU WERE PETTING THE BUNNY.

11:49.067 --> 11:52.200
- WHAT, ARE YOU ON DRUGS?

11:53.567 --> 11:55.500
- NO, NO, I REMEMBER;
I WAS, LIKE, EIGHT YEARS OLD

11:55.500 --> 11:57.767
AND I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
TO GET SOME JUICE,

11:57.767 --> 11:59.200
AND I SAW YOU PETTING IT.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.667
- MAYBE YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
TO GET SOME DRUGS.

12:04.367 --> 12:08.433
- FRANK, IT'S A NICE MEMORY.
HE THINKS IT'S SWEET.

12:08.433 --> 12:11.200
- I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S TAIL
WHAT HE THINKS.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.733
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.500
- ALL RIGHT, DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
MAKING A BIG DEAL FOR?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.067
- BECAUSE YOU MAKE THINGS UP.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.767
- I DON'T THINK SO.

12:17.767 --> 12:20.800
- FRANK, RAY'S TRYING
TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.200
- SHARE A LIE?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.067
- NO.
ABOUT YOU.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.967
WHEN HE SAW YOU
PET THAT BUNNY--

12:27.967 --> 12:29.267
- I DIDN'T PET A BUNNY.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.067
- NO, FRANK,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.400
- I NEVER PET A BUNNY!

12:32.400 --> 12:33.800
- ALL RIGHT, DEBRA,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.667
- NO, NO, RAY.
FRANK, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.900
YOU SHOWED A GENTLE SIDE
TO YOURSELF.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.867
- WHY DO I COME HERE?

12:40.867 --> 12:43.167
I GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO WIN
MILLIONS, YOU GIVE ME THIS!

12:43.167 --> 12:44.667
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.
NEVER MIND, ALL RIGHT?

12:44.667 --> 12:46.033
- NO, YOUNEVER MIND!

12:46.033 --> 12:48.300
GIVE ME THE TICKETS.
THE DEAL IS OFF.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.433
I DON'T SHARE ANYTHING
WITH LIARS.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.367
- ARE YOU SURE HE WASN'T
PUNCHINGTHE BUNNY?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.700
- HI, GRANDMA!

13:18.700 --> 13:20.933
- HERE YOU GO, MARIE,
A LOAD OF TROUBLE FOR THE NIGHT.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.933
- OH, THEY'RE NO TROUBLE.
I MADE SOME COOKIES.

13:23.933 --> 13:27.267
HURRY BEFORE UNCLE ROBERT
AND GRANDPA EAT THEM ALL.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.400
- COOKIES!
- YAY!

13:29.400 --> 13:31.700
- NO, NO!
GET BACK!

13:34.567 --> 13:35.967
- HEY, THANKS FOR SITTING,
MARIE.

13:35.967 --> 13:37.167
- YEAH, THANKS, MA.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.767
HEY, HOW'S DAD DOING?

13:38.767 --> 13:41.200
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
ABOUT THE EULOGY, DID YOU?

13:41.200 --> 13:42.567
- NO, WHY?

13:42.567 --> 13:44.567
- BECAUSE EVER SINCE
HE GOT BACK YESTERDAY,

13:44.567 --> 13:46.767
HE'S BEEN IN A TERRIBLE MOOD.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.733
DEBRA, DID YOU GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO EAT?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.333
- NO, MA.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.100
DEBRA MADE ME BRING UP
THE BUNNY STORY WITH DAD.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.500
- THEN FRANK GOT ALL ANGRY
AND PRETENDED IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.000
- WHY?
IT'S A LOVELY STORY.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.333
HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.000
- MARIE,
THE GUYS ARE COMING OVER.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.167
WE'RE GOING TO THE LODGE.

14:10.167 --> 14:11.800
WHAT DO YOU TWO WANT?

14:11.800 --> 14:13.300
- LISTEN, FRANK--
- NO, LET ME, LET ME.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.567
LOOK, DAD, I'M SORRY

14:14.567 --> 14:17.033
I BROUGHT UP
THE THING YESTERDAY.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.500
I MUST HAVE REMEMBERED WRONG.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.100
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT, RAYMOND.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.233
IT'S A VERY SWEET STORY.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.500
- WHAT STORY?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.633
- THE TIME YOUR FATHER
PET THE BUNNY.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.200
- I DID NOT!

14:28.200 --> 14:30.133
- HOPPY?
YOU PET HOPPY?

14:30.133 --> 14:31.500
- NO!

14:31.500 --> 14:34.167
- WHY WOULD YOU DENY THAT?
- EXACTLY.

14:34.167 --> 14:37.300
- OH, YOU PET HOPPY.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.233
YOU WANT A COOKIE?
I'M GONNA GET YOU A COOKIE.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.333
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

14:42.333 --> 14:44.100
YOU HAPPY?
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.500
- I'M SORRY.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.033
[knock on door]

14:47.033 --> 14:48.333
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.200
- HI, STAN.
HI, GARVIN.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.000
- HEY, RAY'S HERE!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.067
HA HA HA!

14:54.067 --> 14:55.700
- HEY.
HELLO, GUYS.

14:55.700 --> 14:56.800
- YOU READY, FRANK?

14:56.800 --> 14:58.267
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M READY.

14:58.267 --> 14:59.867
I'D GO ANYWHERE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.800
- HEY, FRANK, THAT HANDBALL
TOURNAMENT STARTS NEXT WEEK.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.633
YOU IN?
- YEAH, I'M IN.

15:04.633 --> 15:07.333
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
UP AGAINST BULLETHEAD.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.667
- I CAN BEAT THAT GUY
ON MY WORST DAY.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.233
- OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE THE TOUGHEST, FRANK.

15:12.233 --> 15:13.533
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.667
- HEY, YOU LEAVE THIS
AT THE LODGE?

15:25.733 --> 15:28.000
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.967
- I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

15:29.967 --> 15:33.100
- AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.300
- OH, THAT'S ADORABLE.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.267
- GET OUT OF HERE!

15:38.267 --> 15:40.133
YOU'RE TELLING EVERYONE
YOUR LIES.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.767
- I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING!

15:41.767 --> 15:43.433
- YOU KNOW, IT'S THE TALK
OF THE LODGE.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.167
- YEAH, HOW YOU'D GO
IN THE BACKYARD

15:45.167 --> 15:47.333
AND SING SONGS TO THE BUNNY

15:47.333 --> 15:50.300
AND RUB NOSIES WITH IT.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.733
- [laughing]
RUB NOSES WITH THE BUNNY.

15:59.467 --> 16:02.233
- THERE NEVER WAS ANY BUNNY!
WHO TOLD YOU THIS?

16:02.233 --> 16:03.733
- MY WIFE.
- YOUR WIFE?

16:03.733 --> 16:05.567
HOW THE HELL DOES SHE
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

16:05.567 --> 16:08.333
- YOURWIFE--SHE KNOWS
HOW TO GET THE WORD OUT.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.467
IT'S LIKE TOM-TOMS.

16:10.467 --> 16:14.200
"FRANK PET A BUNNY.
FRANK PET A BUNNY."

16:14.200 --> 16:16.033
- YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE THIS?

16:16.033 --> 16:18.500
- FRANK, YOU SHOULD BE
PROUD OF IT.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.833
FINALLY, YOU'RE LOVEABLE.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.600
- WOULD YOU STOP?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.533
I AM NOT LOVEABLE,
ALL RIGHT?

16:24.533 --> 16:27.133
I AM NOT SWEET!
I FOUGHT IN KOREA!

16:27.133 --> 16:29.467
I AM NO BUNNY-PETTER!

16:29.467 --> 16:32.133
- THEN WHY WOULD RAY
PUT IT IN YOUR EULOGY?

16:35.967 --> 16:38.033
- MY WHAT?

16:38.033 --> 16:39.833
- I CAN EXPLAIN, DAD.
- DON'T, ROBERT.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.600
- APPARENTLY, RAYMOND,
AS SORT OF A FUN HOBBY,

16:43.600 --> 16:47.733
FANTASIZES ABOUT WHAT HE'LL SAY
UPON YOUR DEMISE.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.233
- WHAT?

16:50.233 --> 16:52.400
- OH, YES.
HE WROTE A EULOGY FOR YOU.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.200
AND HE'S READY TO GO
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE...

16:56.200 --> 16:58.667
IF YOU ARE.

17:01.533 --> 17:03.567
- YOU'RE PLANNING MY DEATH?

17:03.567 --> 17:06.700
- NO, NO!
- JUST YOUR FUNERAL.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.533
- RAY, YOU BETTER GO.

17:15.533 --> 17:16.667
- [sighs]

17:18.600 --> 17:21.733
- I'M STILLY WAITING
FOR MYEULOGY, RAYMOND.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.700
- SEE YOU, RAY!
I LIKE THOSE PANTS ON YOU!

17:31.933 --> 17:34.567
[loud banging]

17:34.567 --> 17:35.700
- DAD.

17:37.233 --> 17:39.133
HEY, DAD,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

17:39.133 --> 17:41.267
- CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?

17:43.433 --> 17:45.433
- YOU'RE HITTING A LICENSE PLATE
WITH A HAMMER.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.833
- I'M PERSONALIZING IT.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.567
- LOOK, DAD, YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HEAR THE EULOGY.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.533
- YEAH, I GUESS I SCREWED YOU UP
BY NOT BEING DEAD.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.067
- COME ON.
I WAS JUST--

17:56.067 --> 17:57.367
[hammering]

17:57.367 --> 17:59.100
I WAS WRITING IT FOR MYSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

17:59.100 --> 18:00.867
I--I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.700
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR SCREWED-UP REASON

18:02.700 --> 18:05.367
FOR WRITING
A FUNERAL SPEECH WAS.

18:06.367 --> 18:08.833
I HATED THAT BUNNY!

18:08.833 --> 18:10.967
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU NEVER CLEANED THE CAGE.

18:10.967 --> 18:12.533
IT WAS DIRTY.

18:12.533 --> 18:16.067
YOU KIDS--
"DADDY, BUY ME A BUNNY.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.500
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT."

18:18.500 --> 18:20.767
I WAS LIED TO.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.867
- I WAS EIGHT.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.333
- AND ALREADY A LIAR.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.200
- ALL RIGHT.
DAD, I'M SORRY.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.467
- I HADTO PET THAT BUNNY--
EVERY NIGHT.

18:32.467 --> 18:35.233
- EVERY NIGHT?
- EVERY NIGHT!

18:35.233 --> 18:37.100
THE DAMN BUNNY
NEEDED SOME ATTENTION.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.933
AND THAT'S THE THANKS I GET.
NOW I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

18:40.933 --> 18:42.633
- LOST WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU LOSE?

18:42.633 --> 18:45.500
- OH, NOT MUCH.
JUST MY REPUTATION AS A MAN.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.333
- COME ON, LOOK, THOSE GUYS,
THEY'RE ONLY TEASING YOU.

18:48.333 --> 18:51.667
- LISTEN TO ME.
I'M THE TOUGH ONE.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.000
THAT'S HOW THE COMMUNITY
SEES ME.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.567
- WHAT COMMUNITY?

18:55.567 --> 18:59.433
YOU'RE IN A STEAM ROOM
IN A LODGE WITH SIX NAKED GUYS.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.500
- THAT'S MY COMMUNITY.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.400
AND EVERYONE'S
GOT THEIR THING.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.467
STAN'S GOT THE BRAINS,
GARVIN'S GOT THE LOOKS,

19:06.467 --> 19:08.167
AND I'M THE TOUGH ONE.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.533
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.733
FIRST OF ALL, DAD,
WITH THE LOOKS,

19:11.733 --> 19:14.900
I'M GONNA DECLARE IT
A THREE-WAY TIE.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.100
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.500
- COME ON,
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.067
WHY DO YOU THINK I WROTE
THE EULOGY

19:21.067 --> 19:22.667
WITH THE STUPID BUNNY STORY?

19:22.667 --> 19:25.467
- THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.867
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU

19:26.867 --> 19:28.467
YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME
TELLING EVERYBODY.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.767
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S DIFFERENT, DAD.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.400
- NO, NO, NO,
IT'S A GOOD STORY.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.300
I GO UP TO THE ATTIC ONE DAY...
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.000
- AND I TURN ON THE LIGHT...
- DAD.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.200
- AND IMAGINE MY SURPRISE.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.900
- THAT'S DIFFERENT, DAD!

19:37.900 --> 19:39.300
- NO, IT'S NOT!

19:39.300 --> 19:42.300
I'M TELLING YOU,
I HATE THAT BUNNY STORY!

19:42.300 --> 19:45.167
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU WANT
TO REMEMBER ME LIKE THAT?

19:45.167 --> 19:47.033
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
I WAS TOUGH!

19:47.033 --> 19:48.767
I WORKED HARD AT THAT!

19:48.767 --> 19:50.500
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
THE BUNNY THING--

19:50.500 --> 19:51.800
THE ONLY REASON
I EVEN REMEMBER IT

19:51.800 --> 19:53.667
IS 'CAUSE
IT'S SO UNLIKE YOU.

19:53.667 --> 19:57.000
YOU WERE THE TOUGHEST
SON OF A BITCH I EVER KNEW.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.533
- YOU GONNA PUT THAT IN?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.567
- I COULD.

20:12.567 --> 20:15.700
- WRITE IT DOWN
BEFORE YOU FORGET IT.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.600
- ALL RIGHT.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.000
AND I'LL--I'LL TAKE
THE BUNNY THING OUT.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.100
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.833
MAYBE LEAVE THAT IN.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.433
- YEAH?

20:26.433 --> 20:29.533
- NO, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT SURE NOW.

20:29.533 --> 20:31.533
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:31.533 --> 20:33.133
SURPRISE ME.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.467
- MA, I THINK I'VE
COME UP WITH SOMETHING

20:47.467 --> 20:50.433
YOU MIGHT LIKE
FOR YOUR EULOGY.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.133
[loudly clears throat]

20:56.200 --> 20:59.200
"WHAT CAN I SAY
ABOUT MY DEAR MOTHER?"

20:59.200 --> 21:01.567
- OH, ROBBIE.

21:01.567 --> 21:02.900
ROBBIE,

21:02.900 --> 21:05.867
THAT'S SO VERY NICE.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.567
BUT RAYMOND IS THE WRITER.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.100
AND BESIDES, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE VERY BUSY THAT DAY.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.667
YOU'RE A POLICEMAN.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.933
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
FOR MY MOTORCADE

21:17.933 --> 21:21.000
TO STOP ALL THE TRAFFIC.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.133
SWEET.

21:33.633 --> 21:36.000
- "WHAT CAN I SAY

21:36.000 --> 21:39.133
"ABOUT RAYMOND?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.100
"ONE DAY,

21:44.100 --> 21:46.567
I WENT UP
TO THE ATTIC..."
