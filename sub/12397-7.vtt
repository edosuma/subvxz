00:08.700 --> 00:10.406

WHAT?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.374
THIS IS HOW YOU CATER
A MURDER SCENE.

00:12.410 --> 00:13.968
- IT'S LIKE THE WHO'S WHO
OF FOOD TRUCKS.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.976
IT'S HARD OUT HERE
FOR A SHRIMP.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.614
WHAT?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.470
[965%]
NO.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.943
NOT THE MACHO TACO.

00:23.990 --> 00:28.313
- IS THAT MAURICIO
IN THERE, GUS?

00:28.360 --> 00:31.181
IS THAT MAURICIO
IN THERE?

00:31.230 --> 00:35.018
- DO NOT GO ALL SEAN PENN
IN MYSTIC RIVER ON ME.

00:37.330 --> 00:41.494
IS THAT THE LAST OF
HIS SECRET TACO SAUCE IN THERE?

00:41.540 --> 00:43.701
IS THAT THE LAST
OF HIS SECRET TACO--

00:43.740 --> 00:45.560
OW, OW, TIME-OUT.
THAT HURTS.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.908
- WOULD YOU TWO
PLEASE PULL IT TOGETHER?

00:47.940 --> 00:49.874
OH, WE'VE GOT
ONE DEAD BODY.

00:49.910 --> 00:51.741
THERE WAS A LINE OF CUSTOMERS
WAITING FOR THE TRUCK TO OPEN.

00:51.780 --> 00:52.815
SOMEONE KNOCKED
ON THE SERVICE WINDOW.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.477
A BODY FELL OUT.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.771
MUST HAVE HAPPENED EARLIER
THIS MORNING.

00:55.820 --> 00:58.880
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MAURICIO
IS DEAD.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.751
WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES
WITH THOSE TACOS, GUS.

01:00.790 --> 01:04.851
- WE HAD THE BEST TIMES
WITH THOSE TACOS, SHAWN.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.791

01:32.620 --> 01:34.656
THE TACO MASSA%EHWAS YESTERDAY.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.089
- PLEASE BE FINISHED.
both: ALL RIGHT.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.859
- OKAY, I'VE ALREADY HAULED
IN THE OWNERS

01:37.890 --> 01:39.699
OF THESE OTHER ROACH COACHES
FOR QUESTIONING.

01:39.730 --> 01:42.267
- ROACH COACHES?
- YES, AND I'M BEING GENEROUS.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.393
I'VE WAGED A QUIET WAR
AGAINST THE FOOD TRUCK INDUSTRY

01:44.430 --> 01:45.692
FOR THE LAST YEAR
AND A HALF.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.038
- BECAUSE THE WAR
ON DRUGS, POVERTY,

01:47.070 --> 01:48.594
AND TERROR WERE TOO LOW STAKES
FOR YOU?

01:48.640 --> 01:49.959
- MOCK ALL YOU WANT,
GUSTER,

01:50.010 --> 01:52.035
BUT THE FACT IS FOOD TRUCKS
ARE UNSANITARY,

01:52.070 --> 01:54.277
UNNECESSARY,
AND BORDERLINE ANARCHIST.

01:54.310 --> 01:57.302
THEY'RE LIKE CALIGULA
WITH A LITTLE LESS FORNICATION.

02:01.150 --> 02:02.879
MA'AM, YOUR FOOD TRUCK

02:02.920 --> 02:04.888
WAS PARKED RIGHT NEXT
TO THE MACHO NACHO TRUCK.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.319
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.588
- I'M NOT TELLING
THE POLICE ANYTHING.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.087
- EXCUSE ME?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.088
- LAST TIME I REPORTED A CRIME
TO YOU GUYS,

02:11.130 --> 02:14.099
YOU FINED ME FOR SMELLING
LIKE HOT DOG WATER.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.667
- YOU FINED ME FOR OPERATING
MY TRUCK IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.099
- WELL, DID YOU MOVE IT?

02:18.130 --> 02:19.859
- YES, I MOVED IT
TO A COMMERCIAL ZONE,

02:19.900 --> 02:22.164
BUT YOU FINED ME FOR THAT.
[both laugh]

02:22.210 --> 02:24.166
- YOU SAID IF THERE WAS A FINE
FOR STINKY FOOD,

02:24.210 --> 02:26.030
YOU'D MAKE ME PAY.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.573
- WELL,
IS YOUR FOOD STINKY?

02:28.610 --> 02:30.601
- YES.
- SO THERE YOU GO.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.618
NOBODY'S TALKING.
SOMETHING IS RO'I'I'EN,

02:37.650 --> 02:39.709
AND IT'S NOT THEIR FOOD
OR IMMIGRATION STATUS.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.648
- WELL, LASSIE,
LOOKS LIKE YOU DUG YOURSELF

02:41.690 --> 02:44.022
A HOLE FROM HOLES -SIZED HOLE
WITH THESE GUYS.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.982

SOMEONE WHO CAN GET
ON THE INSIDE,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.125
ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS,
NOURISH THEMSELVES,

02:50.170 --> 02:51.728
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.169
- LET ME GUESS,
THAT SOMEONE

02:53.200 --> 02:54.667
IS YOU TWO DELINQUENTS.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.792

02:57.570 --> 02:59.777
- PLUS, WE'VE BOTH HAD
MAD COW DISEASE.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.004
- NOW BEFORE YOU GO
AND SAY NO--

03:01.040 --> 03:02.746
- YES.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.348
- OH, WHOA, WHOA.
WE NEED A TRUCK.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.644
- WELL, THEN YOU ARE IN LUCK
BECAUSE I IMPOUNDED

03:09.690 --> 03:11.681
SOME POOR SAP'S FOOD TRUCK
LAST MONTH

03:11.720 --> 03:13.153
FOR NOT HAVING A PROPER FOOD
HANDLER'S PERMIT.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.953
- WILL WE NEED
THE PERMIT?

03:14.990 --> 03:16.355
- OH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THERE IS SUCH A THING.

03:16.390 --> 03:20.827
- HA! WELL, IN THAT CASE,
SHOW US OUR TRUCK!

ARE YOU SELLING AMWAY?

03:25.630 --> 03:26.961

NICE TO YOU

DOWN MY THROAT GETS HERE, I'M
DOING THE WORK OF SIX PEOPLE.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.378
- NO WAY TO AMWAY.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.275
- NOT TO MENTION I'VE GOT
A VERY PREGNANT WIFE AT HOME

03:40.320 --> 03:43.118
WHO INSISTS THAT EVERYTHING
SHE'S DOING LATELY IS FOR TWO.

03:43.150 --> 03:44.879

08:27.400 --> 08:29.436
- WELL, THIS IS LIKE THAT
EXCEPT WITH FOOD.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.461
- DRINK IT
ALL THE WAY IN.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.205
- TAKE IT IN.
- ICE CREAM JERKY?

08:33.240 --> 08:34.172
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.700
- WHITE MEAT DRUMSTICKS?

08:35.740 --> 08:37.276
- BULL'S-EYE.
- DEEP IN THERE, DEEP IN THERE.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.107
- PO RK-TARTS?
- WHAT?

08:39.150 --> 08:40.014
- AND PULL IT OUT. WE'RE GONNA
NEED THAT BACK, THOUGH.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.813
WE ONLY PRINTED FIVE.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.011
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, YO, LET ME
GET THAT FROOT LOOP QUESADILLA.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.985
- VERY WISE CHOICE.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.458
- DUDE, YOU ATE UP
ALL THE FROOT LOOPS.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.094
- YOU ATE
ALL THE DAMN CHEESE.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.358
- WE BROKE
THE FIRST RULE.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.425
- WE GOT HIGH
ON OUR OWN SUPPLY.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.860
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- HERE'S WHAT WE GONNA DO.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.961
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE THIS JOKER
A CHICKEN-FRIED SKITTLES PB&J.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.363
- JIVE TURKEY AIN'T GONNA KNOW
WHAT HIT HIM.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.264
COME ON, SON.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.507
UH, HERE YOU GO.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.201
- DON'T EAT IT ALL
IN ONE PLACE.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.718
[both laugh]

09:15.250 --> 09:16.979
HEY, GUS.
- WHAT?

09:17.020 --> 09:18.715
- THAT MEXICAN JOINT SURE SEEMS
TO HAVE BENEFITTED

09:18.750 --> 09:20.581
FROM MAU RICIO'S DEATH.

09:20.620 --> 09:21.882
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.182
- YEAH, WE GOT
A SUSPECT.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.757
TIME TO GO ON THE INSIDE.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.329
- IT'S CALLED "BRANA'S."

09:29.360 --> 09:31.123
THE OWNER'S NAME IS HAROLD.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.023
LIKE MOST OF THE OTHER
RESTAURANT OWNERS AROUND HERE,

09:32.070 --> 09:33.662
HE DOESN'T LIKE US.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.168
SAYS WE TAKE ALL HIS CUSTOMERS
AND PARKING SPACES.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.760
- HMM.
- WELL, DO YOU?

09:38.810 --> 09:40.368
- YES.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.230
- HAROLD DID KNOW MAURICIO.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.407
THEY SAID THAT HE GAVE MAURICIO
HIS FIRST JOB.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.248
AND THEN WHEN MAURICIO
STARTED UP THE MACHO TACO TRUCK,

09:47.280 --> 09:50.886
HAROLD ACCUSED HIM OF STEALING
HIS RECIPE FOR SECRET SAUCE.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.812
[both groan]

09:54.860 --> 09:56.452
- THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

09:56.490 --> 09:57.718
- WELL, DO YOU KNOW
THE SECRET INGREDIENTS

09:57.760 --> 10:00.354
TO THESE DELICIOUS MEATBALLS?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.721
- THOSE AREN'T MEATBALLS, HONEY.
THOSE ARE PRAIRIE BALLS.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.397
- HUH.
WHAT ARE PRAIRIE BALLS?

10:04.430 --> 10:06.830
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, GUS.
- SEE YOU LATER.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.361
IF SALEHA, VITO, AND LILLIAN
ARE ALL TELLING THE TRUTH,

10:09.400 --> 10:10.833
THEN MAYBE HAROLD
FINALLY HAD ENOUGH

10:10.870 --> 10:12.679
OF MAURICIO'S SUCCESS
AND DECIDED TO KILL HIM.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.507
- I SURE WOULD

10:14.540 --> 10:15.973
IF YOU WERE MY SHOE CHEF
AND STOLE MY SECRET RECIPE.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.546
- IT'S "SOUS" CHEF,
NOT "SHOE."

10:17.580 --> 10:18.399
- ANY CHANCE I'VE HEARD THAT
BOTH WAYS?

10:18.450 --> 10:20.145
- NO.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.545
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO SAY THIS.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.445
YOU JUST ATE
COW TESTICLES.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.414
- WHAT?
[9695]

10:26.450 --> 10:28.088
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.587
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU PLAY
WITH DOLLS?

10:29.620 --> 10:32.259
- THIS IS A PRACTICE BABY
FROM THE PARENTING CLASS

10:32.290 --> 10:33.450
THAT MARLOWE SIGNED US UP FOR,
THANKS TO YOU TWO.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.388
- WHY IS IT OUR FAULT?

10:35.430 --> 10:36.590
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO GOT ALL UP IN HER HEAD

10:36.630 --> 10:38.029
ABOUT US
NOT BEING PREPARED.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.890
NOW I'M TAKING
BABY CLASSES

10:39.940 --> 10:41.692
AND BABY-PROOFING THE HOUSE
AND PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER

10:41.740 --> 10:43.367
FOR IT TO SLEEP IN.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.037
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING PREPARED.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.298
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BABY
COMES EARLY?

10:46.340 --> 10:47.637
- LASSITERS ARRIVE
ON THEIR DUE DATE,

10:47.680 --> 10:49.272
NOT A DAY BEFORE.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.345
BESIDES, THE WHOLE POINT
OF PARENTING CLASSES

10:50.380 --> 10:52.348
IS RIDICULOUS.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.348
I MEAN, HOW HARD CAN IT BE
TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY?

10:54.380 --> 10:57.087
GIVE ME THAT.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.815
- GENTLEMEN,
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

10:58.850 --> 11:00.386
- YOU HAROLD ZENGA?
- YES.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.717
- SBPD, WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

11:01.760 --> 11:03.227
ABOUT THE DEATH
OF MAURICIO SANCHEZ.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.659
- WE KNOW YOU AND MAURICIO
HAD BEEF...

11:04.690 --> 11:06.555
- OR CARNE.
- OVER HIM STEALING CUSTOMERS.

11:06.590 --> 11:08.649
- OR CUSTOMERS.
- WHAT?

11:08.700 --> 11:11.191
- HIS DEATH SEEMS TO BE DOING
PRETTY GOOD FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.130
- YES, MAURICIO AND I
WERE BITTER RIVALS,

11:13.170 --> 11:14.364
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.560
- WHERE WERE YOU
YESTERDAY MORNING?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.807
- SMALL CLAIMS COURT
ALL DAY.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.001
I WAS SUING MAURICIO
OVER MY PATENTED SECRET RECIPE.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.133
MAURICIO NEVER SHOWED UP.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.239
HE WAS DEAD.
SAMPLE?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.305
- NO.
I'LL CHECK YOUR ALIBI.

11:26.350 --> 11:29.513
DO NOT LEAVE TOWN.

11:29.550 --> 11:32.348
- WE ARE ONTO YOU, JACK.
- YUP.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.449
- YOU THINK YOU CAN KILL
A CULINARY GOD

11:34.490 --> 11:36.219
LIKE MAURICIO
AND GET AWAY WITH IT

11:36.260 --> 11:38.023
JUST BECAUSE YOU GIVE US
SOME FREE FOOD?

11:38.060 --> 11:40.199
- [laughs]
COME ON, SON.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.296
- OH, DEAR GOD.
- THIS IS DELICIOUS.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.890
- MAN, YOU KNOW MAURICIO
STOLE THIS DUDE'S RECIPE.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.706
- MM-HMM.
- WE SHOULD GET A TABLE.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.507
- DUDE, THIS BETTER WORK.

11:56.540 --> 11:57.575
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE AWAY
FREE FOOD.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.146
- GUS, WE CAN QUESTION

11:59.180 --> 12:00.738
SO MANY MORE POTENTIAL SUSPECT S
THIS WAY.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.180
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY

12:03.220 --> 12:05.347
A THANKSGIVING BALL?

12:05.390 --> 12:06.789
IT IS AN ENTIRE MEAL
OF TURKEY,

12:06.820 --> 12:08.378
STUFFING, MASHED POTATOES
WITH GRAW,

12:08.420 --> 12:10.251
STRING BEANS, CRANBERRY SAUCE,
PUMPKIN PIE,

12:10.290 --> 12:12.019
AND AN ANDES MINT
ROLLED INTO A BALL,

12:12.060 --> 12:14.949
BATTERED, AND DEEP-FRIED.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.765
- DUDE, YOU DIDN'T ASK HIM
ANY QUESTIONS.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.065
- THIS IS TRUE, BUT IT'S CLEAR
HE LIKES OUR BALLS.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.601
- HEY! HEY!
GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT CRAP.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.676
- OOH, HOSS,
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ONE

12:27.710 --> 12:29.769
BEFORE YOU PUNCH MY FRIEND
SQUARE IN THE FACE.

12:29.810 --> 12:32.608
- I RUN A FITNESS CENTER
FOR OVERWEIGHT MEN.

12:32.650 --> 12:34.743
YOU CAN'T BE HANDING OUT
THOSE FATTY FOODS TO MY CLIENTS.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.645
- OH, "HANDLES."

12:36.680 --> 12:38.784
WE THOUGHT YOU SOLD OPENING
AND CARRYING ACCESSORIES.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.685
- YEAH, RELAX, MOOSE, WE DIDN'T
KNOW HANDLES WAS A GYM.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.553
NOBODY'S GONNA THROW DOWN
ON MY BOY'S FACE.

12:43.590 --> 12:46.229
- PEDDLE YOUR HEART-ATTACK BALLS
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.296
- THEY COULD BE
PRAIRIE BALLS.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.469
OKAY, BIG COUNTRY,
WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON

12:50.500 --> 12:51.990
BEFORE YOU GO BOOTS-TO-CHEST
ON MY BOY HERE.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.258
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

12:53.300 --> 12:54.699
- IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND,

12:54.740 --> 12:58.403
WE'VE ALSO GOT DEEP-FRIED
SPLENDA BALLS.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.374
- UH, 'SCUSE ME.
MAY WE HELP YOU?

13:09.420 --> 13:10.546
- I'M WITH THE CITY
HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.841
- WE'RE NOT EXPECTING YOU.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.915
- HENCE THE TERM
"SURPRISE INSPECTION."

13:13.960 --> 13:15.814
- WE KNOW WHAT THE TERM
"SURPRISE INSPECTION" MEANS.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.328
- YEAH, BUT NOT "HENCE."
THAT'S NOT A WORD, IS IT?

13:18.360 --> 13:20.225
- [clicks tongue]
HOW DID WE DO?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.627
[gaSPSJ

13:24.670 --> 13:26.592
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A "D" BEFORE
IN MY LIFE.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.439
- FIRST ONE
I'VE EVER GIVEN.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.438
IT'S LIKE YOU FOUND
THIS FOOD TRUCK IN A JUNKYARD.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.028
I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU
TWO DAYS

13:32.070 --> 13:33.901
TO ADDRESS
THESE NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS,

13:33.940 --> 13:35.237
OR I'LL BE FORCED
TO SHUT YOU DOWN.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.804
- MAN.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.909
- DUDE, DO WE KNOW ANYONE
WHO COULD HELP US

13:38.950 --> 13:40.918
WITH UNSANITARY
COOKING SURFACES,

13:40.950 --> 13:42.611
FOOD OBTAINED
FROM UNAPPROVED SOURCES,

13:42.650 --> 13:43.639
SNAKES--
- SNAKES?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.817
- WHAT?

13:52.860 --> 13:55.454
- SORRY, SHAWN,
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.695
- DAD, THIS CASE DEPENDS ON US
KEEPING OUR FOOD TRUCK OPEN.

13:57.730 --> 13:59.698
NOW, I'VE SEEN YOU MAKE
AN ENTIRE THANKSGIVING MEAL

13:59.730 --> 14:02.039
ON A GRILL THAT YOU MADE
WITH AN OIL BARREL.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.106
IF ANYONE CAN TEACH US
HOW TO SANITIZE A KITCHEN

14:04.140 --> 14:05.903
ON A TRUCK, IT IS YOU.
- MM-HMM.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.500
- LOOK, I CAN'T HAVE YOU TWO
MESSING UP THINGS, NOT TODAY.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.804
PLEASE, SHAWN.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.273
- YOU ARE EVEN MORE CANTANKEROUS
THAN USUAL.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.971
WHAT IS THIS,
A PROSTATE THING?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.382
WAIT A SECOND.
DID YOU PAINT THE PORCH?

14:20.420 --> 14:21.751
- IT WAS LONG OVERDUE.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.724
- THOSE ARE FRESH FLOWERS.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.682
- WHAT, A MAN CAN'T LIKE
THE SMELL OF GARDENIAS?

14:25.730 --> 14:27.823
- NO FISH TCHOTCHKES
ON THE MANTLE

14:27.860 --> 14:30.420
AND A PLATE OF COOKIES
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.097
GUS, DO YOU SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:32.130 --> 14:34.496
- I THOUGHT I DID, BUT NOW
ALL I SMELL ARE FRESH COOKIES.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.837
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.804
JIG'S UP.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.704
I'M SHOWING THE HOUSE
TO POTENTIAL BUYERS

14:38.740 --> 14:40.207
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.605
I WAS GONNA GET AROUND
TO TELLING YOU,

14:41.640 --> 14:42.902
BUT IT'S BEEN A LOT
TO DEAL WITH, AND--

14:42.950 --> 14:44.508
AND YOU DON'T CARE ANYWAY.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.575
- ARE YOU SELLING
MY ROOM TOO?

14:46.610 --> 14:47.713
- WELL, THAT'S USUALLY
HOW IT GOES, SHAWN,

14:47.750 --> 14:48.978
WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE,
YOU KNOW,

14:49.020 --> 14:50.715
GARAGE, MUD ROOM,
SHAWN'S ROOM.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.786
- THIS IS NO GOOD, POP.
I HAVE STUFF IN THAT ROOM.

14:52.820 --> 14:54.287
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL IT IS,

14:54.320 --> 14:55.856
BUT IT'S MINE,
IT BELONGS TO ME.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.824
YOU CAN'T JUST HAND THEM OFF
TO SOME WEIRD FAMILY

14:57.860 --> 14:59.999
THAT'S GONNA THROW FRILLY SHEETS
ON MY TWIN BED.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.691
- WELL, THEN I SUGGEST
YOU GO OUT AND GET SOME BOXES

15:01.730 --> 15:03.425
TO PUT YOUR STUFF IN.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.927
- DAD, THIS IS DUMB
AND INCONVENIENT FOR ME.

15:05.970 --> 15:08.768
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS NOW?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.836
- BECAUSE IT'S TIME,

15:10.870 --> 15:12.599
AND I DON'T NEED
ALL THIS SPACE,

15:12.640 --> 15:15.768
AND, UM...

15:15.810 --> 15:19.405
IT'S TIME.

15:19.450 --> 15:20.417
[door opens]

15:20.450 --> 15:23.840
- TIME FOR WHAT?

15:23.890 --> 15:25.619
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

15:25.650 --> 15:28.858
IF IT WAS YOUR PARENTS SELLING
YOUR ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE?

15:28.890 --> 15:30.755
- THE HOUSE THAT MY MOTHER
AND FATHER WERE ARRESTED IN?

15:30.790 --> 15:32.724
THE HOUSE WHERE MY FATHER
WAS HIDING IN THE BASEMENT

15:32.760 --> 15:34.352
WHILE MY MOTHER WAS OUT
BETTING ON HORSES?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.493
THE HOUSE WHERE YOU SLEPT
WITH MY SISTER?

15:36.530 --> 15:37.963
- THAT DID NOT HAPPEN
IN THE HOUSE.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.365
- YOU SLEPT
WITH MY SISTER, SHAWN.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.369
- WE DIDN'T REALLY SLEEP,
GUS.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.300
WHY DO YOU DO THIS
TO YOURSELF?

15:44.340 --> 15:45.568
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
BRING THIS UP

15:45.610 --> 15:47.475
WHEN YOU KNOW
IT UPSETS YOU?

15:47.510 --> 15:49.034
I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,
AND I WOULDN'T,

15:49.080 --> 15:50.843
BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.610
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF HER.

15:55.350 --> 15:59.116
[tires screech]

16:08.800 --> 16:10.597
- YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT,
SHAWN.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.666
WE'RE NO CLOSER TO SOLVING
MAURICIO'S MURDER.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.167
WE NEED TO FIND CLUES.
- WHAT DID I JUST TELL YOU?

16:14.200 --> 16:15.690
- I WASN'T LISTENING, SHAWN.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.059
- THIS IS
WHERE ALL THE TRUCKS PARK

16:17.110 --> 16:18.759
FOR THE BREAKFAST CROWD
IN THE MORNING.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.278
WE HAVE A PRIME SPOT.
WE'RE GONNA HEAR STUFF.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.039
WE'LL GET CLUES TOMORROW.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.800
- DON'T MOVE, OR I'LL KILL YOU.
[gun cocks]

16:26.850 --> 16:28.147
- OR SOONER.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.088
- [whimpering]

16:34.120 --> 16:35.656
- GIVE ME THE MONEY.

16:35.690 --> 16:36.588
- LOOK, MAN,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.053
- MAN, STOP LYING.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.682
- IT'S THE TRUTH.
WE JUST GOT STARTED.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.493
- CHECK IT OUT, THOUGH.
MASH-UPS GONNA CATCH ON.

16:41.530 --> 16:44.328
I'M TALKING ABOUT GUM BALL SOUP
AND PUDDING RIBS

16:44.370 --> 16:46.065
AND SNICKERS BURRITO
IN A BOWL.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.933
- COME ON, SON.
- WHO'D PAY FOR THAT?

16:48.970 --> 16:51.063
- ALL KINDS OF WEIRD DUDES
AND THEIR WEIRD-ASS CHICKS.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.668
WHY DON'T
YOU TRY SOMETHING

16:52.710 --> 16:54.837
BEFORE YOU FILL
MY FRIEND HERE WITH LEAD?

16:54.880 --> 16:58.475
- WHAT?
- NO, THANKS.

16:58.510 --> 17:00.569
- YO, WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU,
MAN!

17:00.620 --> 17:02.042
ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA BUY OUR FOOD,

17:02.080 --> 17:03.547
AND NEXT TIME,
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE MONEY

17:03.590 --> 17:04.887
FOR YOU TO ROB!

17:04.920 --> 17:06.945
- THE NERVE OF THAT GUY,
ROBBING PEOPLE

17:06.990 --> 17:08.912
AND CRITICIZING
THEIR FOOD.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.985
- MAN, YOU KNOW
THAT ROBBER

17:11.030 --> 17:12.725
AND MAURICIO'S DEATH
ARE PROBABLY CONNECTED.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.523
- I KNOW.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.289
- WHAT YOU WANNA DO NOW?
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:16.330 --> 17:17.968
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TILL THE MORNING, SHAWN.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.558
- GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP
IN A TRUCK.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.467
- [clicks tongue] MAN.
- DUMB PLAN.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.537
- YEAH, WE ALL USED
TO GET ROBBED.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.036
IT'S KINDA LIKE
A RITE OF PASSAGE.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.548
- USED TO?
WHAT MADE IT STOP?

17:32.580 --> 17:35.117
- WE PAY PROTECTION MONEY
TO THE 1085.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.789
THEY ARE THE GANG
THAT CONTROLS THIS AREA.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.687
YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM ME
'CAUSE SNITCHES GET STITCHES.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.051
MM-HMM.

17:42.090 --> 17:43.887
- SOME GUY NAMED SMOKEY
COMES BY,

17:43.930 --> 17:45.227
AND YOU GIVE HIM
THE MONEY,

17:45.260 --> 17:47.353
EXCEPT MAURICIO REFUSED.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.918
- I'VE HAULED IN THE OWNERS

17:50.970 --> 17:53.962
OF THESE OTHER ROACH COACHES
FOR QUESTIONING.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.865
- AW, MAN, I THOUGHT THOSE
INJURIES WERE FROM THE MURDER.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.107
THEY HAPPENED
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.472
MAN, WE GOTTA SMOKE OUT
THIS SMOKEY.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.273
- WHY ARE PEOPLE NAMED SMOKEY
ALWAYS SO SHADY?

18:02.310 --> 18:04.278
- SMOKEY IN FRIDAY.
- SMOKEY FROM THE PJs.

18:04.310 --> 18:06.801
- SMOKEY ROBINSON.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.511
- YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR BOY.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.245
- [grunts]
- WHAT?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.599
ACCORDING TO BUZZ,
THIS IS THE ONLY KNOWN RESIDENT

18:22.630 --> 18:25.292
IN THE AREA WHO GOES
BY THE ALIAS "SMOKEY."

18:25.330 --> 18:26.888
- I DON'T CARE, SHAWN.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.966
ALL I KNOW IS I HAVE
911 ON SPEED DIAL

18:29.000 --> 18:30.729
AND A WHITE GUY VOICE READY
IN CASE WE NEED BACKUP.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.465
- ALL RIGHT.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.774
KRAV MAGA.

18:38.210 --> 18:41.270
- [gaSPSJ
- OH, MAY I HELP YOU, BOYS?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.447
- UH, YES, MA'AM.
HI.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.741
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A SMOKEY?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.883
- SMOKEY?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.252
OH, YOU MUST BE
SOME OF LUTHER'S FRIENDS.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.656
HE'S MY SON.
WAIT RIGHT HERE.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.226
LUTHER!

18:53.260 --> 18:54.955
LUTHER, DON'T MAKE ME
CALL YOU TWICE NOW.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.468
WHERE ARE YOU?

19:00.470 --> 19:01.596
- THINK SHE'S GONNA CATCH HIM?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.302
- PROBABLY NOT.
- MAN.

19:14.620 --> 19:18.317
[all panting]

19:19.650 --> 19:23.882
- WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS?

19:23.930 --> 19:27.149
GIVE ME THE MONEY.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.088
- YOU BETTER CHECK
YOUR TONE.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.495
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT ROBBED US.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.191
- UH-HUH.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.838
- WAIT, THE ENFORCER
FOR THE 1085 HAS ASTHMA?

19:36.870 --> 19:39.703
- ONE OF Y'ALL
IS ABOUT TO DIE.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.901
- [sighs]

19:41.940 --> 19:43.077
YOU'RE IN COLLEGE.

19:43.110 --> 19:45.476
YOU NEED TO STOP
PLAYING GAMES.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.102
YOU KNOW YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO BE A 108

19:47.150 --> 19:49.118
SO THAT YOU COULD SHAKE DOWN
THE FOOD TRUCKS FOR MONEY.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.913
- I WONDER HOW THE 1085
WOULD FEEL

19:50.950 --> 19:53.180
ABOUT YOU FRONTING
ON THEIR TURF.

19:53.220 --> 19:55.916
- PLEASE. YOU CAN'T PUNK ME
INTO SAYING NOTHING.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.951
- REALLY?
- LUTHER!

19:57.990 --> 20:00.026
YOU GET IN HERE!
- HE'S RIGHT OVER HERE!

20:00.060 --> 20:02.199
- OVER HERE!
- YO, YO, YO, YO, YO.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.697
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU TELL
THE 1085.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.368
DO NOT TELL MY MOM.
PLEASE.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.891
- YOU GONNA ANSWER
ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.669
- YES.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.634
- FALSE ALARM!
NO LUTHER IN THE ALLEY!

20:11.670 --> 20:14.138
- NO LUTHER IN THE ALLEY!
- OH, THANK YOU, BOYS.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.569
- OKAY, BYE!
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY!

20:16.610 --> 20:18.202
- LUTHER!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.399
- THAT'S A GOOD LADY
RIGHT THERE.

20:19.450 --> 20:21.008
- YEAH.
- YOU BETTER START TALKING.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.245
- OKAY, OKAY.
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID, OKAY?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.939
MY GAME WAS TO ROB
THE FOOD TRUCKS

20:24.990 --> 20:26.844
AND SCARE THEM
AND THEN COME BACK LATER

20:26.890 --> 20:28.915
AND CONVINCE THEM TO PAY
PROTECTION MONEY TO THE 1085.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.281
- AND IF ONE OF THEM REFUSED,
YOU HAD TO SEND A MESSAGE.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.355
- WELL, DUH.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.924
ANY KID WHO'S SEEN A BUG'S LIFE
KNOWS HOW IT WORKS.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.927
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAD
TO KILL MAURICIO.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.860
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT? NO.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.118
- WE KNOW YOU WENT TO SEE HIM.
- MM-HMM.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.967
- YEAH, TO SCARE HIM,
NOT TO KILL HIM.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.160
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
HE WAS ALREADY

20:43.200 --> 20:44.667
COMING TO BLOWS
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.166
- ARE YOU TELLING US
IT WASN'T YOU

20:46.210 --> 20:47.837
THAT GAVE MAURICIO
THAT BLACK EYE AND BUSTED LIP?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.348
- I AM A MUSICAL THEATER MAJOR,
OKAY?

20:50.380 --> 20:52.143
YOU THINK I'M GONNA RISK
THESE JAZZ HANDS?

20:52.180 --> 20:54.774
- DUDE, STOP DOING THAT.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.014
SO WHO WAS FIGHTING
WITH MAURICIO?

20:56.050 --> 20:58.814
- SOME GUY WITH A CLIPBOARD
AND TIE.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.249
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO DAYS
TO ADDRESS

21:00.290 --> 21:02.850
THESE NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS,

21:02.890 --> 21:05.882
OR I'LL BE FORCED
TO SHUT YOU DOWN.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.965
- AW, MAN,
THE HEALTH INSPECTOR?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.809
I THOUGHT THOSE WERE
INK SMUDGES ON HIS HANDS.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.705
THEY WERE ACTUALLY BRUISES.
- INK SMUDGES?

21:20.740 --> 21:22.105
- INK SMUDGES THAT LOOK
LIKE BRUISES?

21:22.140 --> 21:24.973
- MAN, NOBODY ASKED YOU
TO WEIGH IN, BENETTON!

21:25.010 --> 21:26.307
IT WAS THE INSPECTOR
THAT JACKED UP MAURICIO.

21:26.350 --> 21:28.341
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
SEE HIM AGAIN.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.746
- AS FOR YOU,
RETURN THE MONEY YOU EXTORTED

21:30.790 --> 21:32.815
FROM THE FOOD TRUCKS.
- HELL NO.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.579
- WELL, AT LEAST COME SPEND
SOME OF IT AT OUR TRUCK.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.554
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT BACK.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.923
- I HOPE YOUR MAMA
FINDS YOU.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.848
MM, MM, MM.
- THERE YOU GO, MM-HMM.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.063
- DON'T EAT IT ALL IN ONE PLACE.
[laughter]

21:45.100 --> 21:46.499
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.964
- I'M HERE
FOR YOUR FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.264
- AHH.
- OOH.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.709
- MM.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.401
- GUESS WHAT.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.873
THIS TIME, WE'VE GOT
SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU, BUSTER.

21:55.910 --> 21:57.343
- MM-HMM.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.974
ABOUT THE FIGHT
YOU AND MAURICIO SANCHEZ HAD

22:00.010 --> 22:03.241
THE DAY
BEFORE HE WAS FOUND DEAD.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.145
- UH-OH.
MM.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.612
LOOK AT THAT.
[chuckles]

22:06.650 --> 22:09.778
LOOKS LIKE
MR. I-KNOW-WHAT-FOOD-IS-SAFE-

22:09.820 --> 22:11.754
AND-WHICH-FOOD--
[chokes]

22:11.790 --> 22:13.428
- [chuckles]

22:13.460 --> 22:16.793
_- [gaQSJ
- [feigns gagging]

22:23.270 --> 22:26.137
- [groans]

22:26.170 --> 22:28.138
LOOKS LIKE
MR. I-KNOW-WHAT-FOOD-IS-SAFE-

22:28.180 --> 22:30.444
AND-WHICH-FOOD-ISN'T
HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.199
- I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.
IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.844
MR. SANCHEZ WAS UPSET
WITH THE GRADE I GAVE HIS TRUCK,

22:35.880 --> 22:37.484
AND HE ACCUSED ME
OF SABOTAGE.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.284
HE PHYSICALLY THREATENED ME,
AND WE HAD AN ALTERCATION.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.150
I GOT MY MONEY'S WORTH
FROM MY KICKBOXING CLASS.

22:41.190 --> 22:43.055
THAT WAS IT.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.284
- HOW DO WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
COME BACK THE NEXT DAY

22:44.330 --> 22:46.548
AND KILL HIM?

22:46.590 --> 22:48.854
- THE CITY TRACKS
MY WHEREABOUTS WITH GPS.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.697
CHECK THE RECORDS.
- MM-HMM.

22:50.730 --> 22:51.924
YOU SAID HE ACCUSED YOU
OF SABOTAGE.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.221
NOW, WHY WOULD
HE DO THAT?

22:53.270 --> 22:55.465
- I ONLY INSPECTED
MAURICIO'S TRUCK

22:55.500 --> 22:57.331
BECAUSE I RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

22:57.370 --> 22:59.008
THAT THERE WERE RODENT DROPPINGS
ON THE FLOOR

22:59.040 --> 23:00.530
OF THE MACHO TACO TRUCK.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.605
- MAN, THAT'S NASTY.
[musical ringtone]

23:02.640 --> 23:04.141
YOU RUSHED RIGHT OVER THERE,
DIDN'T YOU, 'CAUSE YOU LIKED IT?

23:04.180 --> 23:05.841
- MM-MM.
- YOU LIKE NASTY STUFF.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.519
- MM-MM.
- NASTY.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.916
LET ME GUESS, YOU WANNA SELL
MY MOTORCYCLE NOW.

23:10.950 --> 23:13.589
- HEY, SHAWN, LISTEN,
I'VE ACCEPTED AN OFFER.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.212
YOU GOTTA COME
AND GET YOUR STUFF.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.581
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
LOOK, I'M BUSY, DAD.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.222
CAN'T THIS WAIT
UNTIL AFTER WE SOLVE THE CASE?

23:19.260 --> 23:20.454
- NO, SHAWN--
- HEY.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.491
HOW MUCH
FOR THE MR. POTATO HEAD?

23:22.530 --> 23:25.419
- I DON'T KNOW, 5 BUCKS,
WHATEVER YOU THINK IT'S WORTH.

23:25.470 --> 23:29.099
- DUDE, WE GOTTA GO.
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.218
UNBELIEVABLE.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.515
NO, HE DID NOT.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.187
- HEY, SHAWN, SHAWN,
GET THAT THING OUT OF THE WAY!

23:50.220 --> 23:51.756
YOU'RE BLOCKING
MY ENTIRE YARD.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.621
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU WOULD SELL MY THINGS

23:53.660 --> 23:55.252
WITHOUT GIVING ME A CHANCE
TO GO THROUGH THEM FIRST.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.824
- YEAH, WELL,
BELIEVE IT.

23:56.860 --> 23:57.565
- WHEN ARE THESE PEOPLE
MOVING IN ANYWAY?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.329
- 45-DAY ESCROW.

23:59.370 --> 24:01.031
- DAD, THAT'S, LIKE,
THREE MONTHS FROM NOW.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.662
- YEAH, WELL,
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.964
I KNOW YOU WOULD'VE STALLED
FOREVER IF I LET YOU.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.409
- IS THAT MY TEDDY RUXPIN
IN THERE?

24:06.440 --> 24:07.998
- NO.

24:08.040 --> 24:08.938
- IS THAT MY TEDDY RUXPIN
IN THERE?

24:08.980 --> 24:10.277
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

24:10.310 --> 24:12.403
- IS THAT MY TEDDY RUXPIN
IN THERE?

24:12.450 --> 24:14.372
YOU TOLD ME THAT MARK FLEMMING
STOLE THIS WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.978
I TOLD HIS PARENTS.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.544
THEY SENT HIM
TO MILITARY SCHOOL FOR IT.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.911
- AND I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT.
AND THEN, I DIDN'T.

24:19.950 --> 24:20.814
- WHAT ELSE AROUND HERE
IS MINE?

24:20.860 --> 24:21.815
- NOTHING.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.782
- MINE.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.282
MINE.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.649
MINE.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.258
- YOU SEE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE NOW?

24:30.300 --> 24:32.268
DO YOU?

24:32.300 --> 24:33.289
- MINE.

24:33.330 --> 24:34.797
- HEY.
- HEY!

24:34.840 --> 24:36.239
- WHAT, ARE YOU HAVING
A MOMENT?

24:36.270 --> 24:39.205
- YEAH, LISTEN, SHAWN,
ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF,

24:39.240 --> 24:40.935
I JUST--
- WHOA, HOLD ON, POP.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.208
YOU BELONG TO HANDLES?

24:42.240 --> 24:44.344
THAT GYM WITH THE GUY?
HANDLES?

24:44.380 --> 24:46.302
- YEAH, NOT EASY LOOKING
THIS GREAT WHEN YOU'RE 50.

24:46.350 --> 24:47.874
IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK,
AND THE ONLY REASON

24:47.920 --> 24:49.012
I GAVE UP MY MEMBERSHIP
IS BECAUSE

24:49.050 --> 24:50.711
I COULDN'T FIND
A PARKING SPACE,

24:50.750 --> 24:53.218
BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE TRUCKS
LIKE YOURS BLOCKING THE WAY.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.083
WOULD YOU GET IT
OUT OF HERE NOW?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.889
- I ONLY INSPECTED
MAURICIO'S TRUCK

25:05.930 --> 25:07.124
BECAUSE I RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

25:07.170 --> 25:08.432
THAT THERE WERE
RODENT DROPPINGS

25:08.470 --> 25:11.234
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE MACHO TACO TRUCK.

25:11.270 --> 25:13.409
- DUDE, IT WAS JAKE.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.237
JAKE WAS
THE ANONYMOUS TIPSTER

25:15.280 --> 25:17.430
WHO CALLED THE HEALTH INSPECTOR
ABOUT MAURICIO'S TRUCK.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.209
- WHY WOULD JAKE CARE? HE
DOESN'T EAT THAT KIND OF FOOD.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.047
- BECAUSE THE MACHO TACO TRUCK

25:21.080 --> 25:23.139
WAS ALWAYS BLOCKING ACCESS
FOR JAKE'S CUSTOMERS.

25:23.180 --> 25:25.216
THAT'S WHY HE WANTED
TO SHUT MAURICIO DOWN.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.512
- WHICH IS WHY HE IMMEDIATELY
DIDN'T LIKE US

25:26.550 --> 25:28.279
WHEN WE TOOK OVER
MAURICIO'S SPOT.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.480
- THAT AND THE FACT
THAT WE WERE HANDING OUT

25:29.520 --> 25:31.579
2,000-CALORIE-A-SERVING
HOLIDAY BALLS

25:31.630 --> 25:33.120
OUTSIDE OF HIS GYM.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.559
WHEN THE SABOTAGE
DIDN'T WORK,

25:34.600 --> 25:36.921
ROID RAGE MUST HAVE KICKED IN,
AND THWACK.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.188
HE KILLED HIM, GUS.
WE SOLVED IT.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.720
WE SOLVED IT.

25:39.770 --> 25:42.466
- YOU ARE A COLD-BLOODED THIEF,
SHAWN.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.104
COLD-BLOODED.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.779
[knock at door]
- YO, JAKE!

25:51.810 --> 25:53.346
- JAKE.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.543
- YEAH, BUSINESS IS
REALLY BOOMING, HUH?

25:56.580 --> 25:59.378
HEY, THE JIG'S UP, MOOSE!
- MM-HMM.

25:59.420 --> 26:01.581
- GAME OVER, BIG COUNTRY!

26:01.620 --> 26:03.110
[laughs]

26:03.160 --> 26:05.958
- WELL, WELL...

26:05.990 --> 26:08.595
- OH, WOW.
HUH.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.190
YOU THINK WE CAN BENCH
THAT MUCH?

26:11.230 --> 26:14.063
- SHAWN, THAT IS CRUEL
AND DISRESPECTFUL.

26:18.510 --> 26:22.002
- SORRY I'M LATE.
STUPID BABY CLASSES AGAIN.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.402
- LASSIE, I AM SENSING
THAT YOUR PRACTICE BABY

26:26.450 --> 26:27.610
HAS HAD MANY ACCIDENTS.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.641
IT ALSO HAS
BRAD DOURIF HAIR,

26:29.680 --> 26:31.489
WHICH IS BEYOND UNSETTLING.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.579
DO WE NEED TO GET PRACTICE
SOCIAL SERVICES DOWN HERE?

26:33.620 --> 26:35.656
- HEY, I MAY HAVE DROPPED IT
A FEW TIMES,

26:35.690 --> 26:37.248
BUT MARLOWE'S THE ONE
WHO LEFT IT IN THE DRYER.

26:37.290 --> 26:40.157
[cell phone rings]
HANG ON.

26:40.190 --> 26:43.318
IT'S DOBSON.
TALK TO ME, DOBSON.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.759
YEAH?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.166
WAIT, SO THE MONEY
THAT SMOKEY EXTORTED

26:47.200 --> 26:49.430
FROM THE FOOD TRUCKS
WAS LINKED TO WHAT?

26:49.470 --> 26:52.507
OKAY, HANG ON A SECOND.

26:52.540 --> 26:55.077
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.

26:55.110 --> 26:56.771
OKAY, SO TRACES
OF BANK DYE

26:56.810 --> 26:58.846
ON SOME OF THE BILLS,

26:58.880 --> 27:01.474
SERIALS FROM TWO ROBBERIES,

27:01.520 --> 27:04.409
ONE ON 4TH AND--
WAS IT 4TH AND MAIN?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.418
- RIGHT ON THE BUNS.
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.112
- ANOTHER ON SYCAMORE.

27:09.160 --> 27:13.927
- THEY ARE THE GANG
THAT CONTROLS THIS AREA.

27:13.960 --> 27:18.329
- THAT'S A PRAIRIE BALL.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.338
- DUDE, BOTH OF THOSE BANKS
ARE IN PLACES

27:23.370 --> 27:24.837
WE PARK
ALL OF OUR TRUCKS.

27:24.870 --> 27:27.168
- WHAT BETTER WAY TO CASE
A BANK YOU WANNA ROB

27:27.210 --> 27:28.472
THAN PARKING A FOOD TRUCK
IN FRONT OF IT

27:28.510 --> 27:30.432
FOR HOURS A DAY?

27:30.480 --> 27:32.471
LASSIE, I AM SENSING
THAT ONE OF THE TRUCKS

27:32.510 --> 27:34.842
IN OUR FLEET
IS SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE

27:34.880 --> 27:36.711
FOR THE RECENT BANK ROBBERIES
AND LINKED TO THE TWO MURDERS.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.513
- MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.984
WELL, TALK TO ME WHEN YOU GET
SOME HARD EVIDENCE.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.783
MCNAB!
- YES, CHIEF?

27:42.820 --> 27:44.424
- SCAN THE NOTES
ON THAT FAKE BABY'S BUTT,

27:44.460 --> 27:46.348
AND EMAIL IT TO ME STAT.

27:46.390 --> 27:48.199
- HEY, GUYS,
I JUST WANNA TELL YOU

27:48.230 --> 27:50.494
THAT I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH YOUR FOOD TRUCK.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.498
- OH.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.339
- YOUR FOOD'S MUCH BETTER
THAN THE MEXICAN FUSION FOOD

27:54.370 --> 27:57.259
YOUR TRUCK USED TO SERVE
BEFORE WE IMPOUNDED IT.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.768
I'M A BIG FAN
OF THE JUST-MICROWAVED TASTE.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.698
- OUR TRUCK USED TO SERVE
MEXICAN FUSION?

28:01.740 --> 28:03.674
- YEAH, IT WAS CALLED
"MOUTH OF THE BORDER."

28:03.710 --> 28:06.247
- THAT MEANS IT WOULD'VE BEEN
DIRECT COMPETITION TO MAURICIO.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.544
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE
WE NEVER SAW THE SIGNAGE.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.275
- GUS, IT IS POSSIBLE
WE HAVE BEEN DRIVING

28:10.320 --> 28:13.016
THE KILLER'S TRUCK
THE WHOLE TIME.

28:30.870 --> 28:33.873
WHAT'S UP, SON?
YOU FRANK PATTON OR WHAT?

28:33.910 --> 28:37.129
- IS THAT MY OLD TRUCK?
- WE'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS HERE.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.807
- WE KNOW IT USED TO BE CALLED
"MOUTH OF THE BORDER,"

28:38.850 --> 28:40.306
AND WE KNOW
THAT MAURICIO SANCHEZ

28:40.350 --> 28:42.238
WAS ONE
OF YOUR CHIEF COMPETITORS.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.885
- YEAH, ME AND MAURICIO WORKED
THE SAME CROWD, SO WHAT?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.285
- WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
HE FELL ON HARD TIMES

28:46.320 --> 28:47.958
ONCE YOU LOST
THE TRUCK.

28:47.990 --> 28:50.117
- I MEAN, ANYBODY WHO SLOW
DANCES WITH A SIGN FOR A LIVING

28:50.160 --> 28:52.048
IS OBVIOUSLY DESPERATE
FOR CASH.

28:52.090 --> 28:53.751
- MAYBE YOU WERE
DESPERATE ENOUGH TO ROB BANKS

28:53.800 --> 28:55.392
NEAR WHERE YOU USED
TO PARK THE TRUCK.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.022
- YEAH, AND MAYBE MAURICIO
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

28:57.060 --> 28:58.288
THREATENED TO GO
TO THE COPS,

28:58.330 --> 29:00.366
AND MAYBE YOU SILENCED HIM.
- MAYBE.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.936
- MAYBE YOU GUYS
GOT IT ALL WRONG.

29:01.970 --> 29:05.235
I LOST MY TRUCK BECAUSE I ATE
TOO MUCH OF MY OWN FOOD.

29:05.270 --> 29:06.498
- [scoffs]

29:06.540 --> 29:07.564
- MIXED UP ORDERS
ALL THE TIME

29:07.610 --> 29:09.578
AND FOUGHT
WITH MY WORKERS.

29:09.610 --> 29:12.249
I FAILED HEALTH INSPECTIONS,
DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT PERMITS.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.340
- SHAME ON YOU, MAN.
- I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.416
TRUCKS FAIL THE TIME,
ALL RIGHT?

29:17.450 --> 29:18.883
PIZZA IN A CUP CLOSED UP,

29:18.920 --> 29:21.684
JUST LIKE KUPCAKE KING
AND IN THE VEGAN-ING.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.381
- IN THE VEGAN-ING
IS STILL OPEN.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.456
- I WAS THERE WHEN VITO'S TRUCK
GOT REPO'D.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.685
HE WAS IN DEEPER
THAN I WAS.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.221
- WHOA, MAN.
THE POTTY TALK.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.329
YOU'RE JUST BEING GROSS.
- HE WAS BROKE.

29:34.370 --> 29:35.667
HE MUST HAVE
COME INTO SOME MONEY.

29:35.700 --> 29:36.928
- IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD ASK THAT.

29:36.970 --> 29:41.805
HAROLD DID KNOW MAURICIO.

29:41.840 --> 29:45.401
- DUDE, THAT'S IT.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.747
JAKE AND VITO BOTH
HAD STRUGGLING BUSINESSES

29:46.780 --> 29:48.372
WITH SIMILAR CLIENTELE.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.115
THEY TRIED TO FORM
A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,

29:50.150 --> 29:52.983
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK,
THEY BECAME PARTNERS IN CRIME.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.817
THEY BECAME BANK ROBBERS.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.159
- THEN SOMETHING WENT WRONG,
AND IT ENDED IN MURDER.

29:58.190 --> 30:00.852
- LASSIE, WE'VE GOT
THAT EVIDENCE YOU ASKED FOR.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.549
MEET US AT THE BUSINESS PARK.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.989
ALL THE FOOD TRUCKS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.521
YO, FRANKIE P.P.,
IF WE BRING THE TRUCK

30:07.570 --> 30:09.663
BACK HERE TO SPEEDY LUBE,
YOU GONNA CUT US A DEAL,

30:09.700 --> 30:11.509
SEEING AS HOW IT USED
TO BE YOURS, YOU KNOW,

30:11.540 --> 30:14.509
BEFORE YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM?

30:14.540 --> 30:17.373
- FINE.

30:20.680 --> 30:24.013
[tires screech]

30:26.790 --> 30:28.451
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT IS THIS?

30:28.490 --> 30:29.957
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

30:29.990 --> 30:32.879
- MARLOWE, HEY!
SHOULDN'T YOU BE TAKING IT EASY?

30:32.930 --> 30:36.889
- YEAH, BUT I HAD
A KILLER PREGNANCY CRAVING

30:36.930 --> 30:39.694
FOR FROOT LOOP QUESADILLA.

30:39.730 --> 30:41.766
EVER SINCE CARLTON TOLD ME
HOW FULL OF FAT

30:41.800 --> 30:44.337
AND SUGAR AND SALT THEY WERE,
I HAD TO SNEAK OUT AND GET ONE.

30:44.370 --> 30:45.405
- UH, LASSIE'S ON HIS WAY
TO MEET US NOW.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.566
- YEAH.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.339
- WHAT?
- LASSIE IS ON HIS WAY--

30:48.380 --> 30:49.631
- DON'T TELL HIM
I BROKE DOCTOR'S ORDERS

30:49.680 --> 30:50.874
AND CAME DOWN HERE
FOR FOOD TRUCK FOOD.

30:50.910 --> 30:52.548
HE HATES FOOD TRUCK FOOD.

30:52.580 --> 30:53.945
- ALL RIGHT,
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH US.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.413
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HIDE YOU, OKAY?

30:55.450 --> 30:56.872
- HUH?
- YEAH, IN THE TRUCK. COME ON.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.683
- ARE YOU SURE THAT WE CAN
TRUST HER WITH OUR FOOD?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.483
- PLEASE,
I CAN CONTROL MYSELF.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.112
OOH, I JUST PEED A LITTLE.
- WHAT?

31:02.160 --> 31:05.618
- WHOA! COME ON, NOW.
THERE ARE NAPKINS IN THERE.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.418
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

31:10.460 --> 31:12.769
- HEY, SHAWN.
- DAD.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- LOOK.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.333
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
KINDA ACTING WEIRD,

31:17.370 --> 31:19.736
AND I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION,
NO--

31:19.770 --> 31:21.635
NO MORE SILLY GAMES,
MAN-TO-MAN.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.500
- I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT RIGHT NOW,

31:23.540 --> 31:25.679
WE NEED YOU TO HIDE
LASSIE'S PREGNANT WIFE

31:25.710 --> 31:26.972
TILL WE CAN GET HIM
OUT OF HERE IMMEDIATELY.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.477
- WHY? WHAT?
- SHE'S IN THE TRUCK.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.818
SHE'S IN THE TRUCK. SHH, SHH.
- WHAT?

31:30.850 --> 31:33.512
- HEY, PARTNER.
WHOA.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.381
IS THAT YOUR FAKE BABY
STRAPPED TO A CAR SEAT?

31:35.420 --> 31:36.580
- DAMN STRAIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:36.620 --> 31:37.985
IT ONLY TOOK ME
45 MINUTES

31:38.030 --> 31:39.622
TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO INSTALL THE THING.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.696
I THINK I AM STARTING
TO GET THE HANG OF THIS.

31:41.730 --> 31:42.594
- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE FRONT SEAT

31:42.630 --> 31:44.621
OR FACING THE FRONT.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.490
- I'M SORRY, HAVE YOU SPENT
TWO HOURS IN A PARENTING CLASS?

31:46.530 --> 31:47.861
- HERE'S THE PLAN.
WE'RE PRETTY SURE IT'S VITO.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.663
- HE'S ON THE INSIDE.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.769
- JUST NEED YOU TO STALL HIM
WITH SOME QUESTIONS

31:50.800 --> 31:52.006
WHILE I GET
A PSYCHIC READING,

31:52.040 --> 31:53.268
AND WE'LL WRAP
THIS BABY UP.

31:53.310 --> 31:56.905
- ALL RIGHT.

31:56.940 --> 31:59.272
- HEY, VITO.

31:59.310 --> 32:02.518
YOU, UH...

32:08.390 --> 32:11.655
- COUNT THIS ONE.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:11.690 --> 32:12.827
[explosion]
- [screams]

32:12.860 --> 32:17.092
[groaning]

32:17.130 --> 32:20.668
- JAKE, I KNOW YOU TOLD
THE HEALTH INSPECTOR.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.997
[grunting]

32:25.410 --> 32:28.277
- I DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR MURDER.

32:28.310 --> 32:32.007
[groans]

32:32.050 --> 32:34.712
- KILL ANYBODY LATELY?

32:34.750 --> 32:36.570
OH, OH, COME ON, MAN!
THAT IS GROSS!

32:36.620 --> 32:37.939
WHY'D HE DO THAT?

32:37.990 --> 32:39.480
- WHO DOES THAT?
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.284
- WITH WE_IRD ORGANIC STUFF.
[tires screech]

32:47.630 --> 32:50.155
[fake baby squeals]

32:55.600 --> 32:58.364
[tires screech]

32:58.410 --> 33:00.867
- WHAT THE--

33:00.910 --> 33:03.936
- YOU GUYS BETTER GET IN HERE.
MARLOWE'S WATER JUST BROKE.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.504
- WHAT THE HELL IS
HE TALKING ABOUT?

33:05.550 --> 33:06.972
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- SORRY, SWEETIE-KINS!

33:07.010 --> 33:09.547
- IS THAT MY WIFE
AND UNBORN CHILD IN THERE?

33:09.580 --> 33:12.310
IS THAT MY WIFE
AND UNBORN CHILD IN THERE?

33:12.350 --> 33:13.942
- NO.
- SON OF A--

33:13.990 --> 33:15.412
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
- THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.348
- I'M COMING!
I'M COMING, HONEY!

33:20.990 --> 33:22.651
_ UH--
- [groans]

33:22.700 --> 33:25.362
I THINK THE GREASY FOOD
INDUCED LABOR!

33:25.400 --> 33:27.163
- NO, NO, NOT LIKE THIS.
NOT LIKE THIS!

33:27.200 --> 33:29.065
- CARLTON, CARLTON!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.739
THE BABY'S ALMOST HERE.
YOU BETTER GET STARTED.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.067
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT DELIVERING A BABY.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.998
- YOU DELIVERED
CHIEF VICK'S BABY.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.928
- I WAS IN THE ROOM, IT'S NOT
LIKE I CAUGHT THE THING.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.379
BESIDES, THAT WAS
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

33:38.410 --> 33:39.946
- OKAY, FINE. I WILL DO IT.
- WHAT?

33:39.980 --> 33:41.413
- BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.008
- NO!
- [screams]

33:43.050 --> 33:44.915
- OKAY, GO! DO IT!
- HEY, MAN.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.440
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

33:46.490 --> 33:49.015
AT LEAST THE TRUCK
IS SANITARY NOW.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.358
- SHAWN, WOULD YOU STOP
SCREWING AROUND?

33:51.390 --> 33:54.120
I'M GONNA NEED HOT WATER
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF TOWELS.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.128
- HOW ABOUT A WARM SODA
AND FIVE MENUS?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.696
- NO, NO, NO,
I DRANK ALL THE SODA.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.164
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
IT'S WARM.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.690
- HOW FAST CAN THIS THING GO?
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME

34:01.740 --> 34:03.890
TO BE TRYING TO CATCH
A CRIMINAL, LASSIE.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.363
- I AM NOT, I NEED TO GET
MY WIFE TO A HOSPITAL.

34:06.410 --> 34:08.674
MY BABY'S NOT GONNA BE BORN
IN THE BACK OF A ROACH COACH.

34:08.710 --> 34:09.904
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

34:09.940 --> 34:10.907
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.840
I GOT IT.
OKAY, OKAY.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.677
OKAY, OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.088
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.961
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES, GUSTER.
- I GOT IT, LASSIE, I GOT IT.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.833
I'LL GET--
I'LL GET YOU THERE, LASSIE.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.033
OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
- OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE!

34:40.070 --> 34:43.335
I'LL DRIVE THIS THING.
[Marlowe groans]

34:43.380 --> 34:45.177
- [grunts]
- [groans]

34:45.210 --> 34:47.747
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
HOW CAN I HELP?

34:47.780 --> 34:49.316
WHAT?
OH, GOD.

34:49.350 --> 34:51.739
- THIS IS CHIEF LASSITER.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.916
I AM EN ROUTE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

34:52.950 --> 34:54.508
I'M REQUESTING
A POLICE ESCORT.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.814
REPEAT, I AM EN ROUTE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

34:57.860 --> 35:00.124
HANG ON!

35:00.160 --> 35:02.299
[tires screech]

35:05.430 --> 35:07.898
- [cries]

35:07.930 --> 35:09.090
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THOSE?

35:09.140 --> 35:10.095
- I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE FRESH.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.438
- SHAWN, PUT 'EM DOWN.

35:12.470 --> 35:14.836
- CONTRACTéIEIJNS COMING!

35:14.880 --> 35:16.632
- DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE-FACE.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.147
HERE COMES THE POLICE ESCORTS.
- ALL RIGHT, MARLOWE.

35:18.180 --> 35:19.977
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST KEEP BREATHING.

35:20.010 --> 35:21.170
KEEP BREATHING, MARLOWE.
THAT'S IT.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.869
JUST LIKE THAT.
KEEP BREATHING.

35:22.920 --> 35:26.515
[both taking deep breaths]

35:26.550 --> 35:28.108
SHAWN, LISTEN.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.855
ABOUT WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU BEFORE--

35:29.890 --> 35:32.256
- DAD, DAD, DAD,
A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIAL

35:32.290 --> 35:34.121
IS PLAYING OUT ON THE FLOOR
OF OUR FOOD TRUCK.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.650
I DON'T KNOW IF NOW'S THE TIME
FOR A MAN-TO-MAN.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.624
[sirens wail]

35:46.210 --> 35:47.905
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
BUNNY-FACE.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.168
ALL RIGHT,
HANG IN THERE.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.747
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
- LOOK, SHAWN.

35:51.780 --> 35:52.940
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER MY ROOF.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.208
YOU'VE BEEN
ON YOUR OWN FOREVER.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.842
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA HAVE GUSTER,

35:55.880 --> 35:57.848
AND NOW--
NOW YOU GOT JULIET--

35:57.880 --> 35:59.142
BREATHE.
- [screams]

35:59.190 --> 36:01.249
- [groans]
- GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.019
YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT COMING HOME AGAIN,

36:03.060 --> 36:03.913
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD'VE ACCEPTED

36:03.960 --> 36:05.120
A LONG TIME AGO.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.185
I ALMOST DIED
LAST YEAR, MAN.

36:07.230 --> 36:09.118
BREATHE!
YOU GOTTA BREATHE, MARLOWE.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.094
[both taking deep breaths]

36:11.130 --> 36:12.529
I JUST THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME

36:12.570 --> 36:14.367
TO TRY SOMETHING NEW
IN MY LIFE.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.265
I DON'T KNOW,
A NEW RELATIONSHIP,

36:16.300 --> 36:17.995
A NEW JOB,
NEW SURROUNDINGS.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.769
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I JUST THOUGHT

36:19.810 --> 36:21.004
I'D START BY SELLING
THE HOUSE

36:21.040 --> 36:22.177
AND SEE WHERE THAT GOES
FROM THERE.

36:22.210 --> 36:24.030
- [groans]
- MARLOWE, BREATHE.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.640
LOOK, I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.671
I WAS JUST ALWAYS HOPING
THAT YOU'D

36:28.720 --> 36:29.948
READ BETWEEN THE LINES.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.914
-AAH!

36:31.950 --> 36:33.212
- DAD, YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD
AT THIS KIND OF STUFF.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.410
WHAT IN THE HISTORY
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

36:34.460 --> 36:35.688
MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD PICK UP ON THAT

36:35.720 --> 36:36.789
WITHOUT YOU TELLING ME?

36:36.820 --> 36:38.822
- I WILL CUT
ONE OF YOU!

36:38.860 --> 36:40.555
- NOW, YOU HANG IN THERE,
BUNNY-FACE, ALL RIGHT?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.959
ALL RIGHT,
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.592
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS
ON OUR FUTURE.

36:45.630 --> 36:46.824
THINK ABOUT US
IN OUR NEW HOUSE.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.191
- YOU GO TO HELL!

36:49.240 --> 36:51.401
- OKEYDOKE.
- [groans]

36:51.440 --> 36:53.738
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO DID YOU SELL THE HOUSE TO?

36:53.770 --> 36:55.101
- SHAWN, THIS REALLY
ISN'T THE TIME.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.779
- DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
SELL MY ROOM TO LASSIE?

36:57.810 --> 36:59.243
- YES, YES, YES, YES,
I DID.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.440
I DID, BUT HE GAVE ME
30,000 MORE

37:00.480 --> 37:01.879
THAN I WOULD'VE ACCEPTED.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.138
- $30,000?
- YES, SHAWN.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.943
I SOLD THE HOUSE.
I'M MOVING ON.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.218
AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO ACCEPT THAT.

37:07.250 --> 37:08.911
- [whimpers]

37:08.960 --> 37:10.154
- ARE YOU CRYING?

37:10.190 --> 37:13.751
- YES.
BUT NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.155
I THINK
MARLOWE'S BREAKING ALL

37:15.200 --> 37:18.124
THE LITTLE, TINY BONES
IN MY HAND.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.388
- [screams]

37:19.430 --> 37:20.988
- [groans
AHH! ]

37:21.030 --> 37:22.691
- [screams]

37:22.740 --> 37:24.560
- LISTEN, POP.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.134
I THINK YOU DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY

37:26.170 --> 37:28.479
EVERY BIT AS MUCH
AS MOM DOES, OKAY?

37:28.510 --> 37:30.273
- SHAWN. SHAWN.
- NO, I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.868
THERE, I SAID IT,
I'VE FELT THAT WAY--

37:31.910 --> 37:33.639
- SHAWN, HERE IT COMES!

37:33.680 --> 37:36.114
- [screams]

37:36.150 --> 37:39.039
- OKAY, I'M HERE,
I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.046
- BREATHE! PUSH!

37:41.090 --> 37:43.115
BREATHE! PUSH! PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
- TAKE THIS. TAKE THAT.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.923
- [groans]
- ALMOST THERE, BUNNY-FACE.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.257
I'M ALMOST THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

37:46.290 --> 37:49.726
- OH, WHY DID I DO THAT?
WHY DID I DO THAT?

37:49.760 --> 37:51.762
- [screams]

37:51.800 --> 37:54.769
[siren wails]

37:57.840 --> 37:59.865
[tires screech]

37:59.910 --> 38:02.071
- [screams]
- OKAY, BABY, WE MADE IT.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.975
DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO
TO KEEP THAT BABY IN YOU

38:04.010 --> 38:04.999
TILL WE GET YOU
INTO A HOSPITAL ROOM.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.244
- CARLTON!
- OVER HERE.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.542
- CARLTON!
- WHAT?

38:07.580 --> 38:09.172
- CARLTON.
- WHAT?

38:09.220 --> 38:12.041
- CONGRATULATIONS.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.978
THAT'S YOUR BABY GIRL.
- WHEN DID IT--

38:14.020 --> 38:16.113
[gasp5]
- [laughs]

38:16.160 --> 38:18.685
- THAT IS SCI-FI.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.880
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

38:20.930 --> 38:23.751
- LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL
SHE IS.

38:25.930 --> 38:28.592
- GUS, GUS,
GET UP, MAN.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.892
GUS.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.430
- [gasp5]
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

38:32.470 --> 38:34.904
- DUDE, GET UP.
WE HAVE CUSTOMERS.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.807
WELCOME TO MASH & GRAB.
FIRE UP THE GRILL.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.070
- OH, BABY.
AW.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.249
OH, LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL
SHE IS.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.987
[sighs]
[baby cries]

38:53.990 --> 38:55.389
- SURPRISINGLY, VITO'S TRUCK
GOT ALL THE WAY

38:55.430 --> 38:57.557
TO ARIZONA
BEFORE THEY NABBED HIM.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.299
WHO KNEW THAT THING
WOULD TOP OUT AT 120, HUH?

39:02.340 --> 39:05.002
ARE YOU HAVING ANOTHER MOMENT
OVER THERE, OR...

39:05.040 --> 39:06.359
- [sighs]

39:06.410 --> 39:08.708
IT DOES SEEM KIND OF EMPTY
NOW, HUH?

39:08.740 --> 39:10.276
- YEAH.

39:10.310 --> 39:12.141
IT'S BEEN
WEIRDING ME OUT TOO,

39:12.180 --> 39:14.978
JUST THINKING ABOUT LASSIE
AND MARLOWE UNDER THIS ROOF.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.875
THEY'RE TOTALLY GONNA DEFY
ALL THE SANCTITY OF...

39:17.920 --> 39:20.548
- [slow motion]
NO!

39:22.320 --> 39:24.083
- THEY CAN HAVE IT.
[clears throat]

39:24.120 --> 39:25.018
- IT'S FITTING THAT IT'S GOING
TO ANOTHER COP

39:25.060 --> 39:26.948
RAISING A NEW FAMILY.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.356
I JUST HOPE THAT KID ENJOYS
THIS ROOM AS MUCH AS YOU DID.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.721
- I DON'T.
I HOPE SHE ENJOYS IT EVEN MORE.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.964
I HOPE THEY LET HER
DO ALL THE STUFF

39:33.000 --> 39:34.433
THAT YOU DIDN'T
LET ME DO,

39:34.470 --> 39:38.861
LIKE JUMP ON THE BED,
CLIMB OUT THE WINDOW.

39:38.910 --> 39:42.937
- I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO LET THAT GO.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.642
- NO, IT'S NOT.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.909
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,
PAPA-RITO, HUH?

39:49.950 --> 39:51.486
I RULE!

39:54.490 --> 39:58.051
- THAT BETTER NOT BE
WHAT I THINK IT IS, SHAWN.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.183
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP THERE?

40:00.230 --> 40:02.448
DO NOT MAKE ME COME UP THERE!
SHAWN!

40:02.500 --> 40:05.094
- I RULE.

40:05.130 --> 40:07.496
- ALL RIGHT.

40:09.370 --> 40:12.464
SHAWN!

40:12.510 --> 40:14.899
[indistinct chatter]

40:14.940 --> 40:16.430
- GUS, I'VE GIVEN THIS
SOME THOUGHT,

40:16.480 --> 40:18.209
AND I'VE DECIDED
THAT THE FOOD TRUCK BUSINESS

40:18.240 --> 40:19.309
IS TOO RUTHLESS
FOR US.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.648
- IT SURE IS.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.045
AW.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.889
- I HAVE THIS LITTLE THING
THAT I DO

40:24.920 --> 40:26.285
THAT ALWAYS MAKES
BABIES SMILE.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.208
- AW.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.059
- [growls]

40:30.090 --> 40:32.456
[baby cries]
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:32.490 --> 40:35.288
YOU'RE SCARING HER,
YOU LUMBERING PITUITARY GIANT.

40:35.330 --> 40:38.151
- CAREFUL.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.895
- SORRY.
- [shushes]

40:39.930 --> 40:41.659
- IT'S OKAY.
HE'S GONE. HE'S GONE.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.339
- WELL, THAT HAPPENED.
[laughs]

40:44.370 --> 40:45.906
ALL RIGHT,
TINY BABY GIRL.

40:45.940 --> 40:49.103
YOU ARE GONNA GROW UP
IN MY OLD ROOM.

40:49.140 --> 40:52.803
SO I FIGURED YOU SHOULD HAVE
ONE OF MY OLD TOYS.

40:54.110 --> 40:55.418
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
FOR ME.

40:55.450 --> 40:57.941
- OOH.
SLOW DOWN THERE, SPENCER.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.210
I ADMIT GETTING
YOUR FATHER'S OLD HOUSE

41:00.250 --> 41:02.184
WAS FORTUITOUS FOR ME
AND THE MISSUS.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.121
- ESPECIALLY SINCE IT DIDN'T
HAVE THAT OLD-MAN SMELL YET.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.718
- BUT IT BEING THE HOUSE
WHERE YOU METAMORPHOSIZED

41:06.760 --> 41:08.227
WAS ALMOST A DEAL BREAKER.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.420
I DON'T WANT
YOUR HEEBIE-JEEBIES

41:09.460 --> 41:10.722
AFFECTING OUR LITTLE
LILLY NORA.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.422
- AW, RELAX, DADDY-KINS.

41:13.470 --> 41:15.938
IT'S A SWEET GESTURE.

41:15.970 --> 41:17.437
[gaSPSJ
OH.

41:17.470 --> 41:20.064
OH, LOOK, LOOK,
SHE LIKES IT.

41:20.110 --> 41:23.500
- IT'S HER FIRST SMILE.
- OH.

41:23.540 --> 41:26.441
- THANK YOU, SPENCER.
- DON'T MENTION IT.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.107
- MINE.

41:30.150 --> 41:32.141
- GUS, THAT'S ROCK BOTTOM.

41:32.190 --> 41:35.557
YOU GOTTA GIVE THAT BACK,
DUDE.

41:35.590 --> 41:37.217
I'LL GET IT.
