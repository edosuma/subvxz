00:36.360 --> 00:38.960
They called him Machete.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.920
$70 a day for yard work.

00:41.930 --> 00:43.660
100 for roofing.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.770
Get in.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.360
125 for septic.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.020
Sewage.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.010
Have you ever killed anyone before?

00:53.220 --> 00:56.130
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

00:56.200 --> 00:58.960
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.

00:59.030 --> 01:01.530
for the good of both our people.

01:01.610 --> 01:04.349
Our new senator must die.

01:04.349 --> 01:07.260
And for that I will pay you $150,000...

01:08.590 --> 01:09.850
cash.

01:09.850 --> 01:13.090
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

01:14.130 --> 01:15.790
I cost the most...

01:16.670 --> 01:18.400
'cause I'm the best there is.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.450
Aah!

01:26.560 --> 01:29.130
Set up, double-crossed,

01:29.190 --> 01:31.530
and left for dead.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.040
I took a vow of peace.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.400
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

01:38.410 --> 01:40.000
Yes, bro.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.700
I mean, Padre.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.900
I will see what I can do.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.370
He knows the score.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.940
Where are my wife and daughter?!

01:57.990 --> 01:59.780
He gets the women.

01:59.860 --> 02:01.180
He's back

02:01.710 --> 02:03.150
Machete

02:03.830 --> 02:05.860
And he kills the bad guys.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.229
No!

02:08.229 --> 02:09.690
Oh, shit.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.480
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

02:12.550 --> 02:15.140
is a goddamn Federale?!

02:15.520 --> 02:17.790
But they soon realized...

02:18.200 --> 02:19.430
He's coming after us.

02:20.630 --> 02:23.970
... they just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.070
- Uhh!
- Action.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.230
Suspense.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.280
Aaaah!

02:34.660 --> 02:36.070
Emotion.

02:36.070 --> 02:37.860
Please, Father, have mercy.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.340
God has mercy. I don't.

02:41.510 --> 02:46.210
If you are gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

02:46.280 --> 02:51.850
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.360
Machete

02:58.810 --> 03:00.470
Rated "X".

03:02.410 --> 03:06.250
Brought to you from your friends
at The Weinstein Company.

[kitten meows]

03:10.960 --> 03:12.790
##

06:43.360 --> 06:45.260
Real pretty tonight, Holly.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.620
God damn it, girls.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.300
If you are gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

06:51.340 --> 06:53.330
Smoking hot. Whew!

06:57.050 --> 07:00.220
Cherry, darling,
I told you too many fucking times--

07:00.290 --> 07:02.230
you can't be up there crying
and all that shit.

07:02.290 --> 07:04.020
You know what a go-go dance is?

07:04.930 --> 07:06.700
Useless talent number 12?

07:06.770 --> 07:08.760
No, it's a happy dance.

07:09.170 --> 07:10.910
You get up there
and you dance happy.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.350
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.920
I'm quitting.

07:15.150 --> 07:16.950
You say that
at least one night a week.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.490
I mean it this time.

07:19.560 --> 07:23.620
I need a dramatic change in my life.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.400
I have always said you are funny.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.060
But if you don't stop
all that crying and shit,

07:27.060 --> 07:28.410
I'm gonna have to fire
your fucking ass,

07:28.410 --> 07:30.630
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like looking at your ass.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.360
"Any girl leaving early"

07:32.360 --> 07:33.700
"must check out with their finger"

07:33.700 --> 07:36.350
"and have a bye-bye slip."

07:38.420 --> 07:41.170
Here's my finger.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.830
And here's my bye-bye slip.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.700
MAN: We are gonna need some cash.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.470
(Growl)

08:10.740 --> 08:12.580
Dick. Fuck!

08:13.010 --> 08:13.690
Aah!

08:13.690 --> 08:14.650
Oh!

08:22.410 --> 08:24.670
Ass bag!

08:25.140 --> 08:26.190
[horn honks]

08:29.910 --> 08:30.670
Aah!

08:31.460 --> 08:32.460
[grunting]

08:44.690 --> 08:47.210
All right, boys. Come on.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.360
All right, all right. Come on.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.800
You guys know the drill, huh?

09:02.220 --> 09:03.460
Wait here, Lieutenant.

09:03.930 --> 09:05.760
I will handle this.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.490
Hey, Abby.

09:13.860 --> 09:16.420
I can see you have had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.620
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

09:20.540 --> 09:22.510
Well, they--they escaped.

09:22.570 --> 09:22.820
Uh...

09:23.710 --> 09:26.150
All three?

09:26.590 --> 09:27.700
Yeah, l--

09:27.750 --> 09:29.040
I don't know, uh--

09:29.040 --> 09:30.950
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

09:31.030 --> 09:33.730
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.660
And you know the rules.

09:36.730 --> 09:37.490
Hold on.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.480
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm--I'm--

09:40.480 --> 09:42.160
You are not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

09:42.160 --> 09:43.030
ABBY: Not so fast.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.130
I also want your balls.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.660
I'm really quite attached to them.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.610
ABBY: Oh, sweetheart.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.370
I was really attached to my specimens.

10:06.450 --> 10:10.060
Now they are out there in the night
doing God knows what.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.070
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.010
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--

10:18.090 --> 10:19.650
Let me go, you motherfuckers!

10:19.720 --> 10:22.160
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

10:22.170 --> 10:23.450
You don't need Abby!

10:23.570 --> 10:24.210
There's more!

10:24.220 --> 10:26.400
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

10:26.470 --> 10:28.470
Fuck!. Motherfucking pussies!

10:28.790 --> 10:31.440
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!

10:31.510 --> 10:33.240
No! No! No! Aah!

10:33.320 --> 10:34.410
Aaaaah!

10:35.320 --> 10:36.870
[blade slices]

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
[squish]

10:43.610 --> 10:44.540
Pick this up, please.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.560
[electronic screeching]

10:51.060 --> 10:52.370
[beeping]

11:03.430 --> 11:05.650
[screeching stops]

11:20.450 --> 11:21.700
Where's the shit?

11:23.230 --> 11:24.760
The shit's right there.

11:25.470 --> 11:26.880
The deal is still good.

11:28.490 --> 11:30.930
No, it's not.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.900
You held out on me.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.350
Now I want all of it.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.090
[tires screech]

11:53.150 --> 11:54.440
Uhh!

11:54.440 --> 11:56.740
[screams]

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
[grunting]

12:02.930 --> 12:05.200
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

12:05.270 --> 12:07.000
You certainly have.

12:07.140 --> 12:07.680
MULDOON: So...

12:10.580 --> 12:12.450
I will ask you one more time.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.860
Where's...

12:15.850 --> 12:17.200
the...

12:18.550 --> 12:19.240
shit?

12:20.130 --> 12:22.180
Everywhere.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.150
[all screaming]

13:03.040 --> 13:04.690
Oh, balls.

13:16.470 --> 13:19.940
[tires screeching]

13:47.880 --> 13:50.410
Get that thing away from my pumps!

13:50.730 --> 13:51.890
It's just overheating.

13:54.950 --> 13:56.650
I need to get to town.

13:59.660 --> 14:01.390
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

14:03.070 --> 14:05.400
Water leaks when it heats up.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.030
No pressure.

14:13.390 --> 14:14.150
You okay?

14:14.730 --> 14:17.130
I'm just cherry.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.360
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I will be right in.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.920
Here, take this with you.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.280
That's your good spring water.

14:26.650 --> 14:28.980
Ain't nothing good about it.
I bottled it myself.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.790
I get it right there out of the dam.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.100
Thanks...

14:33.830 --> 14:34.630
J. T.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.230
We are serving inside tonight.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.300
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.180
I gotta go.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.810
Saving lives, are you?

14:43.820 --> 14:46.150
Now, how did you know that?

14:48.150 --> 14:48.760
[starts engine]

14:54.150 --> 14:55.710
Now, that's a rump roast.

14:57.950 --> 14:58.460
Mmm.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.830
I couldn't get off work this week.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.190
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

15:08.260 --> 15:11.100
(Whispering) A friend of mine will be here
before 10:00 to pick up Tony.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.610
TONY: I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.950
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.820
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.550
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.240
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.390
I will leave him watching TV.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.230
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.080
Thank you.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.900
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.230
Fell out.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.840
Wow.

15:48.430 --> 15:50.640
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.500
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

15:54.830 --> 15:58.040
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.650
Amen.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.770
Who was that you were talking to?

16:04.430 --> 16:05.220
Babysitter.

16:06.830 --> 16:07.670
She's on her way.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.450
- You believe her?
- No.

16:15.910 --> 16:17.610
Me, neither.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.790
- How's it going, J. T. ?
- All right.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.180
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.270
[dog whines]

16:55.360 --> 16:56.190
Free of charge.

16:56.530 --> 16:57.660
Tonight...

16:58.080 --> 16:59.540
is a special night.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.600
What's so special about tonight?

17:03.070 --> 17:04.690
Been open 25 years.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.119
You are the second person
to show up tonight.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.329
Who's the first?

17:09.829 --> 17:10.970
Right there.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.829
Must be passing through.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.770
Seems only strangers eat here.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.190
I still eat here, J. T.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.329
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

17:26.329 --> 17:28.240
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you are eating.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.850
Hello, Palomita.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.250
I don't go by that name anymore.

17:46.050 --> 17:47.130
So, uh...

17:47.760 --> 17:50.660
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

17:53.260 --> 17:54.060
Never did.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.760
I thought for sure you would.

18:00.610 --> 18:01.410
Talked about it enough.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.180
That's the problem with goals--

18:03.180 --> 18:06.240
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.410
That's my jacket.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.890
I looked for it for two weeks.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.560
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

18:13.630 --> 18:15.400
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.070
So, um...

18:19.680 --> 18:20.480
what are you doing now?

18:22.580 --> 18:24.780
I'm going to be a stand-up comedian.

18:27.830 --> 18:28.630
Really?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.430
You are not funny.

18:34.650 --> 18:37.330
That's what I have been trying
to tell everybody,

18:37.410 --> 18:39.320
but they all say I'm hysterical.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.310
But you are not.

18:42.170 --> 18:45.680
There's a difference
between being frank

18:46.090 --> 18:47.770
and being dick.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.750
Yeah, well...

18:50.520 --> 18:52.420
it was really good seeing you again.

18:53.740 --> 18:54.750
Oh. Um...

18:55.360 --> 18:57.340
what name do you go by now...

18:57.510 --> 18:59.110
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

18:59.630 --> 19:01.000
Cherry.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.680
Cherry Darling.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.260
Sounds like a stripper.

19:06.490 --> 19:08.900
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.110
There's a difference.

19:10.690 --> 19:11.490
Right.

19:13.190 --> 19:14.000
Well...

19:15.170 --> 19:17.330
you will always be Palomita to me.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.720
I need a ride.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.290
[dog whines]

19:27.670 --> 19:28.800
What do you say, El Wray?

19:32.280 --> 19:33.940
I will give you a ride.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.500
Good-bye, Bill.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.440
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.830
Hey. What's up, Doc?

19:47.190 --> 19:49.230
The little lady's looking
pretty good there, I gotta say.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.740
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.060
I'm kidding. Heh.

19:54.310 --> 19:57.010
- Take a look at that shit.
- BILL: What happened to your arm?

19:57.100 --> 19:59.140
Well, uh... I got bit.

19:59.210 --> 20:01.520
Bit? Bit by what?

20:01.530 --> 20:03.800
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.900
I need some Bactine or something?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.110
Whew.

20:10.090 --> 20:11.790
Can't you just... sew it up?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.130
Well, normally I would.

20:14.770 --> 20:16.400
I would even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.580
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

20:19.730 --> 20:21.350
DR FELIX:
Oh, shit. Check this out.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.510
When this was still a military hospital,

20:23.510 --> 20:25.550
this one guy came back
from Iraq with this.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.720
Whew!

20:26.790 --> 20:28.510
Chronic herpetic lesions.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.820
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

20:31.830 --> 20:32.700
kind of like a fountain.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.180
Oh, Jesus.

20:34.710 --> 20:35.860
Well, how would you treat it?

20:37.740 --> 20:39.860
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.250
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.420
I swear to God.
I have got these Iraqi eyeballs

20:44.490 --> 20:46.460
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.660
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.260
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

20:50.330 --> 20:51.700
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.390
Bot fly, do you think?

20:54.910 --> 20:57.900
DR FELIX:
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.780
That looks like gout.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.880
He's running a temperature of 105.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.630
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.500
Bad will be 108.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.170
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.980
And--and probably die.

21:13.920 --> 21:14.720
Say "ahh. "

21:15.020 --> 21:17.460
- Ahh.
- Oh! Jesus!

21:17.520 --> 21:19.360
Oh, nice.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.230
Black abscessed tongue.

21:20.810 --> 21:23.360
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.020
[squishing]

21:29.820 --> 21:31.410
(muffled) What are you doing?

21:32.590 --> 21:33.390
Shut up, Joe.

21:44.950 --> 21:47.330
Baby... get the needles.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.520
Be right there.

21:51.990 --> 21:53.790
BILL: [over speaker]
Right now.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.970
Asshole.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.360
It's spreading.

22:05.830 --> 22:06.630
Holy shit.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.190
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.180
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

22:11.180 --> 22:13.250
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

22:13.370 --> 22:15.020
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.810
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

22:17.810 --> 22:19.810
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

22:19.820 --> 22:21.390
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?

22:22.220 --> 22:22.950
Hi, Joe.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.340
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.980
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.250
These...

22:32.220 --> 22:33.350
[whispers]
... are my friends.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.510
My yellow friend...

22:36.390 --> 22:38.890
- ... is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

22:40.110 --> 22:42.370
My blue friend...

22:42.380 --> 22:43.150
you will barely feel.

22:43.820 --> 22:47.700
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.380
See how fast my friends work?

22:51.730 --> 22:54.100
[distorted voice)
And after my red-headed friend...

22:55.070 --> 22:57.170
[whispers)
... you will never see me again.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.340
[echoing]
... see me again, see me again.

23:04.690 --> 23:06.560
They all react differently.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.610
[engine won't start]

23:11.940 --> 23:12.740
Now what?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.030
<i>RADIO DJ:
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--</i>

23:15.110 --> 23:16.710
<i>in loving memory</i>

23:29.470 --> 23:31.170
It's not the radiator.

23:33.010 --> 23:33.810
Damn it.

23:35.710 --> 23:36.620
[sigh]

23:45.840 --> 23:46.850
[gasps]

23:46.980 --> 23:48.980
[distant groaning]

23:53.790 --> 23:54.590
All right.

23:54.990 --> 23:55.790
Fucking thing.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.390
Cheap--whoa.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.200
Damn light.

24:02.370 --> 24:03.170
Ohh.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.180
[car approaching]

24:12.830 --> 24:14.660
Hey. Hey!

24:14.730 --> 24:16.560
Hey! Bastard!

24:16.840 --> 24:17.640
Bastard!

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
[breathing heavily]

24:24.040 --> 24:25.050

24:27.390 --> 24:28.920
Oh, thank God.

24:29.190 --> 24:29.990
Oh.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.000
Oh. Hey!

24:32.430 --> 24:33.730

24:41.030 --> 24:42.030
[groaning]

24:49.030 --> 24:51.430
Ohh! Stop!

24:51.600 --> 24:52.610
Stop!

24:52.710 --> 24:54.710
Please! Stop!

24:55.120 --> 24:57.120
[snarling]

24:57.250 --> 24:59.870
WOMAN: No! No!

25:00.020 --> 25:02.020
[chomping and snarling]

25:15.480 --> 25:17.280
What the hell was that?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.590
People picking up road kill.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.220
What, like an armadillo?

25:24.170 --> 25:24.970
Deer.

25:26.270 --> 25:28.070
You get a lot of them around here.

25:28.910 --> 25:31.250
You know, I read a statistic that said...

25:31.320 --> 25:35.820
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.130
60% of that's from road kill.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.140
People eat road kill?

25:42.210 --> 25:44.180
If you are driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

25:44.240 --> 25:45.970
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

25:46.150 --> 25:49.050
if you blink or brake or swerve--

25:49.350 --> 25:51.080
shit, you will just kill yourself.

25:51.160 --> 25:51.960
So, what do you do?

25:52.630 --> 25:54.000
Just pick them off...

25:54.500 --> 25:55.300
just like this.

25:55.830 --> 25:57.030
Send it flying away from you.

25:57.900 --> 25:58.700
Unacceptable.

25:59.750 --> 26:00.750
Oh, fuck!

26:06.390 --> 26:08.460
CHERRY: Aah! Aah!

26:17.820 --> 26:18.620
Cherry?

26:20.390 --> 26:24.190
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

26:24.260 --> 26:25.070
It wasn't a deer.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.690
[screaming]

26:27.570 --> 26:30.100
Cherry! Cherry! No!

26:47.150 --> 26:49.160
[snarling]

26:49.250 --> 26:50.050
CHERRY: Aah!

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
[snarling]

27:03.240 --> 27:04.040
Palomita.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.450
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

27:10.520 --> 27:12.520
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

27:12.730 --> 27:14.460
possible spinal trauma...

27:15.600 --> 27:16.800
one severed limb.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.970
Where's the leg?

27:20.040 --> 27:21.880
Three sickos attacked her.

27:21.950 --> 27:23.750
I shot at them.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.410
I never miss.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.660
They took the leg with them.

27:44.290 --> 27:46.890
You will have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

27:46.960 --> 27:47.760
He has to sign her in.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.200
Do what, now?.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.540
Well, he's with her.
He's responsible for her.

27:51.610 --> 27:54.580
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.510
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

27:59.640 --> 28:00.440
Nothing.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.610
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

28:04.180 --> 28:04.980
Come on, Wray.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.880
You know you are not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.500
And here I stick my neck out for you.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.500
Now you have got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

28:14.760 --> 28:16.470
A missing leg that's now missing?

28:17.290 --> 28:18.640
And here you are saying
in front of everybody

28:18.720 --> 28:20.550
that someone up and snatched it?

28:21.020 --> 28:22.200
And that you shot at them with a gun

28:22.200 --> 28:24.590
that you never should have had
in the first place?

28:24.670 --> 28:25.470
And that now they are gone?

28:26.440 --> 28:28.570
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

28:28.650 --> 28:29.510
My thought exactly.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.200
Doctor Block!

28:31.770 --> 28:33.770
Three fresh ones rolling in!

28:34.270 --> 28:35.070
Christ, you are kidding.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.710
PARAMEDIC: Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

28:37.780 --> 28:38.580
DOAs?

28:39.250 --> 28:40.050
Have Andy pick them up.

28:42.330 --> 28:44.260
That's unsanitary, Doc.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.940
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

28:47.010 --> 28:49.480
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

28:49.550 --> 28:50.550
Fuck.

28:50.550 --> 28:52.580
You might cut yourself pretty good.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.850
Then I would know I was not calm.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.340
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.800
Somebody call my wife.

29:06.170 --> 29:07.170
[telephone rings]

29:07.310 --> 29:08.110
Sheriff Hague.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.470
<i>It's J.T., Sheriff.</i>

29:10.550 --> 29:12.610
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

29:13.090 --> 29:15.960
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

29:15.990 --> 29:17.490
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.090
I wish there was something
I could do.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.100
DC-2?

29:20.130 --> 29:22.110
Right now I ain't calling my brother.
I'm calling the sheriff.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.740
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

29:23.740 --> 29:25.260
Well, what about
countering with atropine?

29:25.380 --> 29:26.820
<i>J.T.: Well. there ain't no trouble.
Not yet. anyway.</i>

29:26.850 --> 29:29.510
I got two delinquents been hanging
around here for over an hour.

29:29.590 --> 29:31.520
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

29:33.430 --> 29:35.160
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

29:35.330 --> 29:38.520
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

29:38.710 --> 29:41.060
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.150
You give me that recipe, or I will raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

29:44.220 --> 29:47.060
<i>Brother, ain't no Texans ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.</i>

29:47.060 --> 29:48.730
That's a fact.
He will take it to his grave.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.690
<i>I could be bleeding like a stuck pig.
I ain't gonna tell you.</i>

29:50.740 --> 29:52.640
WRAY: Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.040
<i>J.T.: I could be dying in your arms.
I ain't gonna tell you!</i>

29:54.200 --> 29:55.930
- Heh heh heh.
- We will see about that.

30:00.510 --> 30:01.310
You gonna look.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.920
or you gonna eat?

30:12.940 --> 30:13.740
You called for me?

30:14.440 --> 30:16.280
I need for you to see this.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.380
PARAMEDIC: Looks like a no-brainer.

30:20.450 --> 30:21.250
BILL: What does that mean?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.520
SECOND PARAMEDIC: No brain.

30:23.590 --> 30:26.100
Scooped clean out of her skull.

30:26.370 --> 30:28.100
DR FELIX: Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

30:28.170 --> 30:30.700
Don't tell me.
Uh... liquefactive necrosis.

30:31.910 --> 30:32.710
PARAMEDIC: You think?

30:33.180 --> 30:33.980
DR FELIX: Oh, sure, yeah.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.010
Thank you. That will be all.

30:44.540 --> 30:45.340
Oh...

30:50.010 --> 30:52.180
Did you know she was back in town?

30:54.120 --> 30:54.920
No.

30:56.590 --> 30:57.390
I didn't.

31:03.310 --> 31:05.040
What happened to her?

31:06.480 --> 31:08.110
I don't know, baby.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.520
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.200
We have.

31:20.610 --> 31:23.580
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.150
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.300
I--

31:33.770 --> 31:35.960
I haven't talked to her in a while.

31:40.310 --> 31:42.110
But you have written each other.

31:46.460 --> 31:48.190
Here and there.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.030
But not--

31:50.100 --> 31:51.630
What are you doing?!

31:52.540 --> 31:55.010
Let me see your last three messages.

31:56.910 --> 31:58.820
- You have no right.
- I don't?

32:00.050 --> 32:01.350
I don't have a right?

32:05.460 --> 32:06.260
Show it to me.

32:07.740 --> 32:09.330
Show it to me.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.210
No.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.340
Aah!

32:12.950 --> 32:14.810
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.350
Show it to me.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.420
[crying]
No, please.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.370
- Show... it... to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

32:28.450 --> 32:29.450
[drops syringe]

32:29.610 --> 32:32.170
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

32:40.140 --> 32:41.140
[whimpering]

32:43.510 --> 32:44.310
That's pretty fast.

32:46.570 --> 32:47.570
[beep]

32:48.820 --> 32:50.220
Oh, what do I know, my love?

32:51.790 --> 32:53.450
Exactly.

32:53.530 --> 32:56.360
That you are a cheating, lying...

32:59.440 --> 33:01.270
sack.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.580
I didn't want to hurt you.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.010
BILL: [whispers]
But you did.

33:06.290 --> 33:07.090
Bill...

33:07.620 --> 33:09.680
you are insane.

33:12.830 --> 33:14.460
And I was afraid...

33:15.570 --> 33:17.840
of what you might do to me,

33:17.910 --> 33:19.740
to our son.

33:20.780 --> 33:23.080
I'm the mother of your son.

33:23.620 --> 33:26.110
Aah!

33:28.460 --> 33:30.430
And after this one...

33:31.870 --> 33:34.030
I will never see you again.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.040
PARAMEDIC: Doc.

33:49.670 --> 33:50.820
What?

33:51.380 --> 33:53.320
You gotta see this.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.680
I will be right there.

34:06.970 --> 34:08.570
Where the hell are the bodies?

34:08.639 --> 34:10.580
That's what we wanted to show you.

34:10.650 --> 34:11.449
They are gone.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.810
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?

34:14.940 --> 34:15.989
# Mmm-hmm #

34:38.730 --> 34:40.429
[breathing heavily]

34:47.960 --> 34:49.800
[grunting]

34:58.130 --> 34:59.130
Okay.

35:00.430 --> 35:01.430
Okay.

35:03.950 --> 35:05.310
Shut the fuck up!

35:05.580 --> 35:08.490
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

35:08.600 --> 35:09.660
What the hell's going on?

35:09.660 --> 35:12.290
Ah, he was causing a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,

35:13.160 --> 35:16.070
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off!

35:16.140 --> 35:19.050
Quit your hollering and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.330
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.010
He bit my finger clean off!

35:24.090 --> 35:25.880
Fucking shit!

35:25.960 --> 35:27.630
Get out there and book him,

35:27.630 --> 35:29.600
'cause I will fucking kill him
if I have to do it.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.220
Carlos, go get him.

35:32.140 --> 35:35.170
Wray, you stay put.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.550
Are you sure he's in there?

35:59.390 --> 36:01.120
He was.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.230
Motherfucker.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.620
[dramatic music]

36:35.600 --> 36:36.910
He's gone.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.310
Broke out the window.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.640
Where's my finger?

36:41.710 --> 36:43.230
Found your ring.

36:43.310 --> 36:45.980
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

36:47.050 --> 36:49.150
WRAY: I didn't get
a good look at mine.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
[snarling]

36:52.700 --> 36:54.690
That him over there?

38:35.380 --> 38:36.390
[snarls]

38:40.440 --> 38:42.880
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

38:42.950 --> 38:43.750
He's infected.

38:44.450 --> 38:45.250
With what?

38:45.720 --> 38:46.520
Everything.

38:47.110 --> 38:49.170
Wray!
Drop the fucking gun.

38:56.380 --> 38:58.400
Where the fuck
do you think you are going?!

38:58.480 --> 39:00.470
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

39:00.550 --> 39:02.850
Fine. But we are taking my car.

39:08.740 --> 39:09.720
I'm riding with you.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.200
Don't make any sudden moves.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.460
Viral infections.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.680
They came pouring in.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.690
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.780
Highly contagious.

39:36.860 --> 39:38.620
What do you think?

39:39.660 --> 39:41.940
Self-preservation comes to mind.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.800
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

39:46.110 --> 39:48.440
First let me get my wife.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.920
Come on, come on.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.660
Open up, now.

41:02.730 --> 41:04.890
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

41:04.970 --> 41:07.530
We don't want you checking out

41:07.530 --> 41:10.130
God... damn.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.050

Look at me!

44:56.670 --> 44:57.460
Look at me!

44:59.100 --> 45:01.510
I was gonna be a stand-up comedian.

45:01.510 --> 45:02.900
But who's gonna laugh now?

45:03.080 --> 45:04.950
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

45:05.020 --> 45:05.820
Let's go.

45:05.890 --> 45:07.510
[crying]
It's not funny. It's pathetic.

45:07.590 --> 45:08.890
Would you stop crying over fucking...

45:09.630 --> 45:10.430

What do you think?

45:28.860 --> 45:31.160
You could carry me, Wray.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.470
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

45:34.150 --> 45:35.340
Why start now?

45:39.120 --> 45:40.240
Ah-ah!

45:41.700 --> 45:42.290
Uhh!

Ahh!

45:45.190 --> 45:46.240

This is fucking ridiculous.

45:53.780 --> 45:54.780
[snarling]

45:55.950 --> 45:57.940
The sheriff must have
taken the others to J. T's.

Get in.

God damn it, wait for me.

46:18.110 --> 46:20.780
My leg's stuck in the door!

46:20.970 --> 46:22.900
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

46:22.920 --> 46:24.230
Will you just leave it alone?

46:24.910 --> 46:26.410
Why is this happening to me?

46:26.510 --> 46:29.420
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...

46:29.480 --> 46:31.280
stay strong.

46:32.530 --> 46:33.530
"Stay"?

46:35.130 --> 46:37.600
Yeah, baby. Stay.

46:39.300 --> 46:41.300
Okay, my name is Electra.

46:41.380 --> 46:42.180
Fucking listen.

46:42.650 --> 46:44.270
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.600

46:46.700 --> 46:48.150
It's furry.

46:50.130 --> 46:50.930
No.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.900
He's a furry one.

46:52.930 --> 46:55.390
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

46:55.390 --> 46:57.440
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

46:59.970 --> 47:02.180
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want--I don't give a shit.

We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

47:12.310 --> 47:14.800
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

47:14.880 --> 47:16.410
That's right.

47:16.580 --> 47:18.550
Then start doing it.

47:20.060 --> 47:20.860

And my turtle.

47:34.990 --> 47:35.790
And my scorpion.

Ohh... come on, let's go.

47:50.020 --> 47:51.650
Tony, what did I tell you?

47:51.720 --> 47:54.350
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

47:54.430 --> 47:57.000
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.030
What about my pocket bike?

47:59.500 --> 48:00.300
It's in the trunk.

50:47.410 --> 50:49.440
I'm not kidding, Tony.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.080
You shoot them...

50:53.260 --> 50:55.720
You shoot them in the head.

50:56.260 --> 50:57.930

51:14.070 --> 51:16.130
And be careful
where you point that thing.

51:16.420 --> 51:17.500
You will blow your own face off.

52:57.810 --> 52:59.840
Got anything that could
transport more people?

53:02.120 --> 53:03.140
Where's the top?

53:03.690 --> 53:05.920
This baby's chopped permanent.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.020

Are you a wrecker, Wray?

53:27.640 --> 53:29.440
I'm nobody.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.840
It's the easiest thing to remember.

I highly doubt that.

54:52.210 --> 54:54.230
That's my jacket.

54:54.310 --> 54:56.250
Yes, I know.

54:56.320 --> 54:58.290
I looked for it for two weeks.

54:59.220 --> 55:03.180
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick.

55:03.260 --> 55:05.490
I was walking out on you.

55:05.570 --> 55:08.330
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

So, if you are gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

55:12.750 --> 55:14.680
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

55:14.750 --> 55:17.990
'cause I would rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

55:20.230 --> 55:21.990
Did you find what was in the pocket?

55:22.070 --> 55:23.730
Fuck no.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.210
Look for it.

55:28.550 --> 55:29.350
No, the other one.

55:39.770 --> 55:42.100
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

Remember that?

56:07.560 --> 56:09.120
I never forgot it.

56:10.060 --> 56:12.560
Then why would you leave?

56:13.840 --> 56:16.070
Because you didn't believe in us,

56:16.240 --> 56:19.240

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.430
Also known as "Project Terror. "

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.540
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.580
You were supplying it to them.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.920
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:26.960
It's under our feet.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.970
Ten stories down.

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:32.940
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.580
It delays the negative effects.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.460
They need it...

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:38.030
like a drug.

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:41.090
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.330
are not affected by the gas itself,

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.930
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:47.640
What do you want to do?

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.320
Mexico.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.190
Put our backs against the ocean

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.860
and defend ourselves from there.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.800
No. We have to get back to my lab.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:59.860
This infection will spread
all over the world,

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.930
to every man, woman and child,

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:03.570
unless I finish my antidote.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:05.980
You have an antidote?

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:07.470
[door opens]

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.970
You! You!

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.440
Come with us.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.040
Move it!

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.950
Move it, Peggy!

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.360
Uhh!

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.680
[muffled]
Do you like Ava Gardner?

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.660
I'm sorry?

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.530
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:51.980
Yeah, I guess.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.540
I was just thinking that you, uh...

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.650
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.510
[elevator stops]

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.630
You got something
you want to say to me?

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.680
I have nothing to say to you.

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:12.650
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.750
'Cause I could have swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:18.149
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:20.390
Not at this moment.

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:24.630
You know what this is?

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.710
A gun.

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:29.880
It's simplicity itself.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.880
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.819
and you pull the little trigger here...

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:38.970
and a little bullet comes out of here.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.310
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.620
And you know what?

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:48.279
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100
[holsters gun]

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.899
Don't taunt me, tramp.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.520
I am not one to be taunted.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.180
You got it?

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.580
Let me here you say, "l got it. "

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.990
I got it.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.930
You damn well better.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
[elevator starts up]

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:18.700
Tool.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:20.250
[saxophone playing]

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.560
J.T.: [whispering]
God damn it, that's it.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.130
I figured it out.

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:31.109
Salt.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.439
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:33.979
Blood is salty.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:37.189
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.350
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talking about?

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.260
What are you doing, J. T. ?

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:43.569
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:45.970
It would just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.439
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:50.410
Don't do nothing stupid, J. T.
I got it covered.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.450
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:58.030
- Drop the gun!
- J.T.!

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120
[grunting]

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.030
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.640
Don't shoot!

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.070
J.T., you all right?

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.130
[J.T. grunts]

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:08.440
Uhh!

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.590
Hey, you all right, bro?

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.530
J.T.: God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.400
Not at all.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.730
Wait here.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:22.700
Oh... I sure will.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.100
[chuckles]

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.050
Goddamn sauce.

She's got one leg.

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.410
Easier access.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.320
You got a point.

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.680
Get the rest of this shit upstairs
and we will blow this entire floor.

Yes, sir.

Their balls, sweetheart.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.440
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.740
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:22.620
Because I earned it.

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.480
How do you figure that?

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.860
You want the story?
I will spin it for you quick.

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:30.800
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:34.000
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:37.810
and our balls in our throats,
looking for America's most wanted.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.380
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:41.580
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.460
I come around a corner--

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.800
Bam, there he is,
looking me right in the eyes.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.760
Wait.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:48.140
You killed bin Laden?

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.570
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.670
So that was you.

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:54.550
Yeah.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.720
That was me.

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:00.890
Class-A cluster-fuck.

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:04.730
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.640
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:12.070
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.850
No cure.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.360
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.450
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.800
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

infect a large enough populace,

the experiment and its survivors,

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:31.310
you would find a cure.

I swore to my men
that I would do everything in my power

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:34.960
to keep them alive.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.890

Heh.

I was earlier tonight.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.430
I always wanted to be a doctor.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.240
Instead, I can do...

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:15.610
this.

Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

DAKOTA: A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

She said at some point in your life,

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.320
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.980
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:39.390
I'm not that optimistic.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.020
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:43.900
She would say...

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.010
when you are stuck in that spiral...

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:48.810
you reach up.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.580
What if there's nothing up there?

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.720
Just reach up.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.360
You are a dancer.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.370
I was earlier tonight.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.790

but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,

with 12 toes,

and I have seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:58.040
but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

didn't you?

Actually, yes.

Always have.

I believe that you could be better.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.440
You deserve better,

Any that are left
we will get on our way to the helicopters.

01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:12.000
There are two helicopters,

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:14.100
big enough to take all of us.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.140

I think we are gonna stay here, Wray.

No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:09.080
Don't you get it?

01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.170
We are the antidote.

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:13.440
Well, is there another way around?

Take that as a no.

We have to get over that wall!

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.700
I was thinking we could build us
a new place,

01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:59.900
right there where the old one was.

01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:02.330

You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

We share the recipe,

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.870

It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

01:41:13.650 --> 01:41:16.480

every once in a while with pot.

I'm not having a tantrum.

Come on, don't fight.
I will pay for it when we get some.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.490
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.750
And two, we are not really fighting.

01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:33.500
Arlene, you have forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

and indulging her at the same time.

You bet your ass he is...

Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.830
He's got a big thing for Julia.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.130
If he had a big thing for me,
he would fucking call me,

01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.860
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.600
and he would get his ass down here
more often than he does.

01:42:01.670 --> 01:42:04.410
And on my birthday
he would give me a fucking phone call.

01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:06.720
But other than that he's putty
in my hands.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.820
So what's the plan, man?

01:42:09.330 --> 01:42:10.890
Margaritas and Mexican
food at Guero's,

01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:13.140
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:15.300
and make damn sure they come.

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.550
Those other guys will be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.890
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.960
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:26.730
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.640
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they are never gonna respect you.

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.080
Okay, we are pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:34.340
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.450
Oh, nothing to write home about.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.920
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:40.560
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.300
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing. "

01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:46.770
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.680
You know, it's everything but.

01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:50.480
They call that "the thing"?

01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:52.110
I call it "the thing. "

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:54.150
Do guys like "the thing"?

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.920
They like it better than "no thing. "

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.200
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:01.830
So you are making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:02.940
Correct.

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.470
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.980
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:09.080
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:11.590
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:14.260
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:16.660
I was straddling him.

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.640
- So what about tonight?
- Well, we will see, Shanna.

01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:22.620
I mean I like Nate.
He's cute, he's a pretty good kisser.

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:23.530
But it ain't a done deal.

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:24.750
Yeah, fuck Nate.

01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:25.520
I mean, he's cute and all,

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.620
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.940
Jessie Letterman the Austin director
who did "Potheads"?

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.240
He's a good friend.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.950
Maybe they can bring some pot.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.710
Fuck that. No.

01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:37.170
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:38.960
or B, depending on their ass.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:39.940
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.580
we are gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.

01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:09.390
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

01:45:09.490 --> 01:45:12.160
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:14.530
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.240
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:20.340
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:23.040
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.520
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they would see us.

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:29.590
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:33.240
if they would do something,
you would do something.

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.670
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:37.080
What did you say
and what did you say I would do?

01:45:37.150 --> 01:45:41.090
Anyhow, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:43.270
or Marcy over here,

01:45:43.890 --> 01:45:46.450
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

01:45:46.530 --> 01:45:50.530
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:52.770
Okay, so just tell me your way.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.840
- So we will act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:56.200
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:57.620
[slides drink]

01:45:58.610 --> 01:46:01.910
Okay, so you are
in a club or a bar,

01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:04.960
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:06.770
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.570
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.440
Got it.

01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:12.710
Okay, Marcy, take it.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.440
[chuckles]

01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:22.340
[in southern accent]
Howdy.

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:25.200
[sighs]
Hi, there.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.570
[chuckles]
Excuse me, but...

01:46:28.050 --> 01:46:30.110
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly, " would it?

01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:34.090
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:34.960
Barry.

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.360
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:38.230
Y'all are getting me hot!

01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:39.770
Shh!

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.080
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.250
Yes, it is.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.260
And how would you know
my name, Barry?

01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:54.130
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.000
Oh, you did, did you?

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:57.740
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.

01:46:57.810 --> 01:46:59.100
Oh, you do, do you?

01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:02.300
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:05.170
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.290
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.770
She got a black girl's ass.

01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:12.700
[chuckles]
Well, that's what she always says,

01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:15.640
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:17.700
She's got a 'big' ass.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:18.920
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.

01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.790
Okay, we will get to the point,

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.160
but for your information,
skinny bitch,

01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.320
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.850
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.830
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.680
If you are not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:37.380
[normal voice]
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:38.990
[southern accent]
So, Butterfly...

01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:41.120
can I buy you a drink?

01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:42.110
I would love one.

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.240
What can I get ya?

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:44.860
I will take a margarita.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:45.850
[chuckles]

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.260
Here ya go.

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:50.910
So, after they buy you a drink

01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.380
when they raise
their glass to toast,

01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:57.460
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem--

01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:02.130
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:06.970
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep. "

01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:10.080
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.910
"Miles to go before you sleep. "

01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:16.310
And then, if they say that...

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.170
you gotta give them a lap dance.

01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:20.590
- BUTTERFLY: What?
- [laughs]

01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:23.770
If they call you "Butterfly, "
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:24.850
you gotta give them a lap dance.

01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:26.820
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.510
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:30.560
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.490
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.090
thinking you are a chicken shit.

01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:36.330
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:39.940
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.990
I said you would do it
for the first guy who says it.

01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:45.080
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:48.060
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:51.870
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:54.430
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:56.100
you have had a few drinks,

01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.380
you are kind of loosey-goosey,

01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:00.250
you are safe with your girls,

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.060
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

01:49:03.130 --> 01:49:06.930
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.010
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:12.730

Uh, these two. Thank you.

01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:32.210
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:35.230
That's a good fucking question.

Where are you?

01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:53.850
Well, come over already.
We are waiting for you.

- Shit! Hold on!

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.590
So, where are you?

01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:13.800
Come over already.
We are waiting for you.

01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:17.170
No. We are not coming over there.

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:20.080
You come over here
like you said you would.

01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:23.150
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:25.700
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. l...

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.490
No.

01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:29.770
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:32.670
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.300
We all hate the name "Shauna, "

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:36.820
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna. "

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.240
Just remember...

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.060
it's "Shanna Banana, "
not "Shauna Banauna. "

01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:21.340
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:24.630
- Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...

Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.

If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:00.750
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:04.350
- Warren says it, we do it!
- WARREN: I love that philosophy!

"Warren says it, we do it. "

So let's do it!

What is it?

Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!

Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

What the fuck is it?!

01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:30.900
Chartreuse.

they named a color after it.

- [cheering]
- Not me.

01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:41.830
I'm going out for a smoke.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.360
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.160

you are trying to get her out of here

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.950
before Christian Simonson shows up,

01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:44.620
but you have got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.710
Yeah, but what's the point?

01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:47.740
They are going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:48.610
and it's no guys.

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.600
Absolutely no guys.

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.270
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,

01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:57.560
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.190
[chuckling]
You think they are gonna fall for that?

01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:03.190
We will be very convincing.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.710
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:07.610
We go to Jäger shots.

01:56:08.210 --> 01:56:10.410
[chuckling]
Man, they are not gonna drink Jäger shots.

01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:12.340
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.260
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:15.650
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger

01:56:15.650 --> 01:56:17.590
down these
fucking bitches' throats.

01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:19.760
After that, we will see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:20.840
You never know.

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:23.310
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it. "

01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:25.180
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:27.180
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:28.050
My point exactly.

01:56:30.970 --> 01:56:31.970
[chuckles]

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.800
Dude, check it out.

01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:35.930
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:39.250
Jesus.

01:56:40.190 --> 01:56:41.190
[twangs song]

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.730
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:46.920
[laughs]

01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.570
  Well, the last time he shot him  

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:51.710
  caused Billy Lyons to die.  

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.330
  Staggolee told Mrs. Billy:  

01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:57.760
  “You don’t believe your man is dead?  

01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.660
[girls chattering]

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.420
  Come on into the barroom,  

01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:03.380
  See the hole
I shot in his head  

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.830
[Shanna singing]

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.550
  The high sheriff
told the deputy  

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.070
  Get your pistols
and come with me  

01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:14.050
  We got to go arrest
a bad man  

01:57:14.410 --> 01:57:16.710
  Known as Staggolee...  

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.630
  The deputies took their ...  

01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.760
JUNGLE JULIA:
And where did you two disappear to?

01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:22.340
I had to get something
out of the car,

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:25.530
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:27.620
Ah, good for you, Nate.

01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:29.900
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.290
Who, the dirty hippie?

01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:36.200
Meow. She's not a hippie.

01:57:36.370 --> 01:57:37.610
She might as well be a hippie.

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:38.950
[laughs]

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.700
Thank you, Timmy boy.

01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:44.340
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?

01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:47.190
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.

01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:48.370
[all laugh]

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.620
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.420
What about her?

01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:54.640
[scoffs]

01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:55.720
[laughs]

01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:56.940
PAM: Hey, Warren!

01:57:57.340 --> 01:58:00.480
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:01.830
[keys clatter]

01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:05.390
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:07.560
- You have been eavesdropping?
- [chuckles]

01:58:07.630 --> 01:58:10.300
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear. "

01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:12.400
I think I belong
in the latter category.

01:58:13.710 --> 01:58:15.370
So, uh, Icy Hot.

01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:17.680
You are offering me a ride home?

01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:21.380
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.690
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.630
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:29.510
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.940
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:34.040
I know looks can be deceiving.

01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:36.460
But I'm a teetotaler.

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.190
I have been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.250
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:45.600
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:49.380
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:52.110
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:56.050
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

01:58:56.130 --> 01:58:58.620
Mmm. Really?

01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:00.150
Like what?

01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:02.970
Women.

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.850
Nacho grande platters.

01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:08.480
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,

01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:09.350
like Warren here.

01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:11.270
[Pam chuckles]
Fair enough.

01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:13.510
So what's your name, Icy?

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.560
Stuntman Mike.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.200
Stuntman Mike's your name?

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.110
Tsk. You ask anybody.

01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:24.010
Hey, Warren.

01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:25.310
Who is this guy?

01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:27.010
WARREN: Stuntman Mike.

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.710
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?

01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:30.590
He's a stuntman.

01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:31.770
[chuckles]

01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:35.270

Well, beggars can't be choosers.

02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:59.070

It lasts longer.

02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:01.150
What?

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:02.390
That table.

02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:04.690
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:07.250
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:07.940
Yep.

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.840
She sure is a striking-looking woman.

02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:13.080
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...

02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:14.380
Look at that hair.

02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:15.510
Lots of leave-in conditioner.

02:01:17.650 --> 02:01:19.640
Is that jealousy I detect?

02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.690
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.600
there's a real easy way to do that.

02:01:25.670 --> 02:01:27.230
Really, what would that be?

02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:30.740
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she will find you.

02:01:30.810 --> 02:01:34.180
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:35.780
Enjoy it, cocksucker.

02:01:35.850 --> 02:01:36.660
You have earned it.

02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.290
What did she ever do to you?

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.750
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

02:01:41.890 --> 02:01:44.040
That's what she did to me.

02:01:44.110 --> 02:01:45.840
She was her height right now at 12.

02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.610
- She was a monster.
- [chuckling]

02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.590
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.

02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:55.070
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.820
That pituitary case?

02:01:56.850 --> 02:01:58.360
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...

02:01:58.370 --> 02:02:01.740
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man--

02:02:01.810 --> 02:02:04.980
but I would die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:28.090
Hey! Are you
famous or something?

02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:29.640
Or something.

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.530
No, no, no. Really.

02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:34.650
Hey, what do-- what do you do?

02:02:35.550 --> 02:02:36.350
Really?

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:40.830
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.900
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D. J.

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:48.680
Wait a minute.

02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:54.150
You have got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.020
Yeah.

02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.160
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:01.800
Yeah.

Well.

Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:14.560
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

02:03:14.630 --> 02:03:15.430
Would you care for some?

02:03:15.970 --> 02:03:16.770
Thank you, Julia,

02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:20.100
but just the same...
no thanks.

02:03:20.410 --> 02:03:21.930
- Suit yourself.
- But you know--

02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:25.890

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.140

Oh, shit.

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:34.840
Ah! My God.

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:38.810
Sorry. It's nothing.

02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:43.590
What the fuck was that?

02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:47.200
[chattering, laughing]

02:03:48.730 --> 02:03:50.600
You got some voucher here.

02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:52.330
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

02:03:52.410 --> 02:03:54.100
No fucking clue.

02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:57.410
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:00.460
I mean, he shows me
an episode of 'High Chaparral'.

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.320
a guy falls off a horse,

02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.790
he says it's him.

02:04:03.150 --> 02:04:03.990
[Warren laughs]

02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:06.900
You know the show 'The Virginian'?

02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:11.500
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:13.450
and I looked like him a bit--

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.680
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:18.720
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:22.800
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:26.540
Anyway, I did a lot of 'Virginians'
doubling Gary Clarke.

02:04:26.610 --> 02:04:30.340
And, uh... then that show turned
into 'The Men of Shiloh'.

02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:33.150
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:36.490
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:40.130
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of 'Vega$'.

02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.430
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:45.380
And then Bob
did another show, 'Gavilan'.

02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:47.940
and he brought me
with him on that, till--

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.520
And after that...

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.340
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

02:04:58.410 --> 02:04:59.210
Sorry.

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:00.850
- No?
- Mm-mm.

02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:01.910
No, no.

02:05:05.150 --> 02:05:09.910
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:12.510
[sighs]

02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:16.640
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.610
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:23.310
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:24.190
How's that?

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:26.740
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:28.100
Stuntman Bob.

02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:29.590
[snorts, chuckles]

02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:31.880

02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:42.830
I'm ready to blaze!

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:46.170
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:48.240
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

02:05:48.570 --> 02:05:51.580
Anyhow, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:57.390
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:59.890
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:00.790
Mm-hmm.

02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:03.800
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:06.100
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:08.590
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:10.540
Mmm, us girls.

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:11.420
Good idea.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
[bottles clink]

02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.620
STUNTMAN MIKE: Ladies?

02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.790
Thanks.

02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:21.200
Cheers, Butterfly.

02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:27.050
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:29.750
"And I have promises to keep,

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.470
And miles to go
before I sleep. "

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.270
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

02:06:36.370 --> 02:06:39.900
"Miles to go
before you sleep. "

02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:43.550
Sorry, Stuntman Burt--

02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:44.350
Mike.

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:45.950
Mike.

02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:48.250
She already broke off that dance.

02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:49.650
Is that true?

02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:53.500
Did I miss my chance?

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.870
Do I frighten you?

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.190
Is it my scar?

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.090
It's your car.

02:07:09.170 --> 02:07:11.230
Ah, yeah, I know.

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.470
Sorry.
[inhales deeply]

02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:15.380
It's my mom's car.

02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:16.460
[chuckles softly]

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.510
Have you been following us?

02:07:19.590 --> 02:07:22.290
[chuckling] No, but that's
what I love about Austin--

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:24.630
it's just so damn small.

02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:27.330
- You have seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.810
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:33.470
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:37.120
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

02:07:37.190 --> 02:07:39.160
So you really weren't following us?

02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:43.070
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:49.240
So, how about that lap dance?

02:07:49.710 --> 02:07:51.450
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.890
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.390
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:59.490
I'm good that way.

02:07:59.570 --> 02:08:03.370
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.630
Wounded, slightly.

02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:05.710
Why should I be wounded?

02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:09.020
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

02:08:09.090 --> 02:08:11.850
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:15.300
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:21.780
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:28.780
So... [sighs]

02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:30.890
How about that lap dance?

02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:35.970
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.350
Well, since you will be leaving
in the next couple of days,

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:43.410
that rain check will be worthless.

02:08:45.690 --> 02:08:46.490
But that's okay.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:50.860
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.540
You are still a nice girl.

02:08:53.610 --> 02:08:55.410
And I still like you.

02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:58.980
But I must warn you of something.

02:09:00.190 --> 02:09:02.680
You know how people say,

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:04.460
"You are okay in my book, "

02:09:04.530 --> 02:09:06.300
or, "In my book, that's no good. "

02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:11.870
Well, I actually have a book.

02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:17.520
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:21.590
And now I have met you,
and you are going in the book.

02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:22.940
[Butterfly chuckles]

02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:25.270
Except...

02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:27.970
I'm afraid I must file you...

02:09:29.550 --> 02:09:31.480
under...

02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:33.080
"Chicken Shit."

02:09:33.150 --> 02:09:35.450
And what if I did it?

02:09:35.530 --> 02:09:37.790
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit, "

02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:39.960
then, now, could I?

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.230
What's your name again?

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:45.640
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

02:09:45.710 --> 02:09:47.270
I'm Butterfly.

02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:51.840
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.260
Yeah, it is.

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.550
[quietly]
Yeah.

02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.070
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:01.190
[sighs]

02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:12.810
I'm driving.

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:13.540
[chattering]

02:10:14.070 --> 02:10:16.260
We are gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:17.440
Ready to go?

02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:18.420
Yeah.

02:10:18.590 --> 02:10:20.360
- Bye.
BOTH: Bye.

02:10:23.630 --> 02:10:25.640
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:26.900
[both laugh]

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.440
Looking good, Cannonball Run!

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:32.520
He's just giving me a ride.

02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:33.390
Oh, no doubt.

02:10:33.690 --> 02:10:35.400
Have a nice ride!

02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:36.810
[both laughing]

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.260
Look, double fucks.

02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:41.700
[both tittering]

02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:45.480
I am not gonna fuck him.

02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:46.350
I can hear you.

02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:47.680
[laughing]

02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:51.910
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:53.310
[both laugh again]

02:10:54.690 --> 02:10:55.390
Bye.

02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.200
Bye-bye!

02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:00.210
[both lightly chuckle]

02:11:03.850 --> 02:11:05.820
Wow, that's fucking scary.

02:11:05.890 --> 02:11:07.910
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:10.020
[sniffs]
scary tends to impress.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.270
Is it safe?

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:14.670
No, it's better than safe.

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.370
It's death-proof.

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.980
How do you make a car death-proof?

02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:20.840
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:23.550
You have seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:26.060
there ain't no way in hell
any body's walking away from?

02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:27.130
Yeah.

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.690
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

02:11:29.770 --> 02:11:31.150
- CGI?
- [laughs]

02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:35.810
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you are right.

02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:38.150
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothing days...

02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:42.020
'Vanishing Point' days,
the 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry' days,

02:11:42.090 --> 02:11:43.750
the 'White Line Fever' days...

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:46.260
real cars smashing into real cars.

02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:48.440
Real dumb people driving them.

02:11:49.570 --> 02:11:52.600
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:55.240
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:56.360
<i>Voila!</i>

02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:59.830
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:04.960
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:08.840
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.480
Just for the experience.

02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:12.270
[door squeaks]

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:14.300
[Pam chuckles]

02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:19.840
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.690
Well, this is a movie car.

02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:25.190
Sometimes when you are shooting a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car--

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:27.540
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:30.320
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.640
[grunts, clears throat]

02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:32.830
[metal clangs loudly]

02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:34.960
- There you go.
- [Pam chuckles]

02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:37.330
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.300
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

02:12:39.370 --> 02:12:42.370
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:44.350
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes. "

02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.410
But look at the bright side, Pam--

02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:48.790
I won't be getting fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:49.880
[laughs]

02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:52.390
That is a bright side.

02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:54.240
I thought so.

02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:55.820
[door creaks, slams]

02:13:03.450 --> 02:13:04.450
[girls laughing]

02:13:07.770 --> 02:13:08.770
[girl screams]

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:10.200
[car speeds away]

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.850
[door slams, car idles loudly]

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.300
[Pam laughs]

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:21.460
Well, Pam...

02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:22.930
which way are you going?

02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:24.960
- Left or right?
- Right.

02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:27.340
Ah, that's too bad.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:28.800
Why?

02:13:29.110 --> 02:13:32.980
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you would be going left or right.

02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:35.180
You see, we are both going left.

02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:37.240
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.120
and if that was the case,

02:13:38.690 --> 02:13:41.360
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:43.800
But since
you are going the other way,

02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:45.430
I'm afraid...

02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:48.910
you are gonna
have to start getting scared...

02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:49.780
immediately.

02:13:50.110 --> 02:13:50.940
What the fuck?!

02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:54.390
[tires squealing]

02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:02.570
Cock sucking motherfucker!

02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.230
Just fucking let me out of here!

02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:05.870
I will fucking rip your fucking--

02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:07.070
Stop the fucking car!

02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:09.250
Why are you being such a shit?

02:14:09.670 --> 02:14:11.170
[screaming, tires squealing]

02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:14.620
[horn honks]

02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:15.870
[continues screaming, gasping]

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.340
[tires squealing]

02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:29.940
[car frame squeaking, rattling]

02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:35.280
[grunting]

02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:41.840
[continues grunting]

02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.770
Okay.

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.040
Here's the thing.

02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:55.320
[shakily chuckles]
I get it.

02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:57.780
This... is all a joke.

02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:00.550
A-hah! Super funny!

02:15:00.730 --> 02:15:03.140
It's... really funny, Okay?

02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:05.280
But, um...
You can stop now.

02:15:05.610 --> 02:15:07.030
And, if-- if-- if-- if--

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.120
--If...

02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.610
... if you just drop me off?

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.400
[laughs, crying]

02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:14.720
- I swear I won't say anything--
- Hey, Pam!

02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:19.220
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.970
[frame rattling, squeaking]
Well, that wasn't a lie.

This car is 100% death proof.

02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:28.420
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:32.480
you really need to be sitting in my seat.

02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:35.510

02:16:09.970 --> 02:16:13.560
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

02:16:18.110 --> 02:16:19.110
[tires squeal]

02:16:28.070 --> 02:16:29.070
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:32.370
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.

02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.840
So, you got it?

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:37.790
Thanks, honey.
You are gonna play it next song, right?

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.889
Good boy.

02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:41.969

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.030
Growl!

02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:46.160
Bye-bye.

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:47.040
Who do you want to hear?

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:49.639
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:50.510
Who?

02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:53.180
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

02:16:54.750 --> 02:16:55.840
Who the fuck are they?

02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:59.030
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,

02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.860
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,

02:17:00.930 --> 02:17:02.600
he would have ended up in this group,

02:17:02.670 --> 02:17:06.410
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.040
And if you ask me,
he should have.

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.520

[indistinct voice over intercom]

<i>Self-restraints to Room 310. </i>

02:20:14.050 --> 02:20:18.740
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

02:20:19.430 --> 02:20:21.660
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:23.570
Come on now, Sis.

02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:25.940
You just tell us.

02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:26.810
How bad is he?

02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:33.750
He got banged up real good.

02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:37.830
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.

02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.100
Is that it?

02:20:41.310 --> 02:20:43.040
He was real lucky.

02:20:43.230 --> 02:20:44.230
[chuckles]

02:20:45.250 --> 02:20:47.010
That will be all?

02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:50.390
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:55.120
[grunts]
Son of a bitch.

02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:58.870
So, Pop.

02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:00.470
What do you think?

02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:02.380
Well, Son Number One,

02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:06.450
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:09.930
Well, give it a shot.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.030
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:15.840
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:19.680
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they are dead just the same.

02:21:21.250 --> 02:21:22.780
Well, what are you gonna do?

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:25.860
Not a goddamn thing.

02:21:25.930 --> 02:21:28.200
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:33.110
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floating on weed,

02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:37.990
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:42.060
Now, you actually think that he
premeditating murdered them gals?

02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:44.300
Well, I can't prove it.

02:21:44.370 --> 02:21:47.530
But since thinking don't cost nothing,
I can think it, and I do.

02:21:47.610 --> 02:21:50.980
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:53.580
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn--

02:21:53.650 --> 02:21:56.390
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

02:21:56.460 --> 02:21:58.160
chewed them up and spit them out.

02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:59.030
Did any of them survive?

02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:01.570
[scoffs]
Shit.

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:04.110
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

02:22:04.170 --> 02:22:06.580
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton--

02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:08.740
they all princess died.

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.850
Why?

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:14.080
[shutter clicks]

02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:17.730
EARL: Well, I would guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

02:22:18.310 --> 02:22:20.300
The only way I can figure it.

02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:24.380
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:28.650
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:33.530
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:34.850
[clicks]

02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:41.730
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoe.

02:22:41.810 --> 02:22:45.810
It just so happens we are all three
off-duty for the next three days.

02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:48.700
Fucking hell! How does that happen?

02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:52.020
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:54.960
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:59.040
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the next four days.

02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:00.770
So how the hell's the shoot going?

02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.910
Great. We are having the best time.

02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:05.080
The director, Cecil Evans, is so much fun.

02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:08.390
We are making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:12.060
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

02:23:12.130 --> 02:23:14.040
So let's hear it, ladies.

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:16.510
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:18.840
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:22.210
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

02:23:22.390 --> 02:23:24.440
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:26.890
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:28.970
What's his perversion?

02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:33.710
He likes to watch me pee.

02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.280
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:40.880
# P-l-S-S-l-N-G #

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:41.770
Ooh!

02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:43.990
Yeah, but not no more.

02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:46.300
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:48.240
You had a one-off with the Rock?

02:23:48.310 --> 02:23:50.600
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:53.020
And Kim started calling him the Rock,
'cause he kinda looks like the Rock,

02:23:53.250 --> 02:23:54.480
so now we all just call him the Rock.

02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:57.560
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:00.910
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:04.300
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.010
Who would you steal him from?

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:06.880
Nobody!

02:24:07.450 --> 02:24:08.510
ABBIE: Kim!
- Wha--what?

02:24:10.090 --> 02:24:11.750
He totally had a girlfriend.

02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:15.460
ZOE: All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:17.630
I did not steal him!

02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:21.710
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:23.750
[girls snorting]

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:28.850
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:30.160
I had a set crush on Cecil.

02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:35.070
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:37.370
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:40.140
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

02:24:40.210 --> 02:24:44.720
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:48.210
[all snorting and cackling]

02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:51.960
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:53.410
Oh, it's so funny!

02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:56.400
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:58.550
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:01.590
Bitch, You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:04.120
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

02:25:05.470 --> 02:25:07.870
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:11.020
He fucked her on my birthday.

02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:13.580
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:16.880
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:19.560
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.760
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

02:25:24.270 --> 02:25:26.260
- [whispers] Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:28.740
What did he get you?

02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:33.820
He made me a tape.

02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:36.290
He made you a tape?

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.590
- [shrieks]
- Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:39.470
He made you a tape?

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.600
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:46.270
Yes, I know what you are gonna say,
so don't even go there.

02:25:46.350 --> 02:25:48.370
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

02:25:48.450 --> 02:25:52.150
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:54.820
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:56.800
How can you not be on my side?

02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:58.510
I admit, that sounds bad.

02:25:58.720 --> 02:25:59.710
It is bad!

02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:03.110
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:03.980
Were you two fucking?

02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:05.220
Hell, no.

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:07.660
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.090
Sorry.

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:12.470
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:15.190
What do you mean "No, of course not"?

02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:18.700
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:22.080
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:24.420
you don't become one
of his girlfriends--

02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:26.740
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:32.460
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

02:26:32.770 --> 02:26:38.300
I would be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fucking old for that shit.

02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:41.550
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

02:26:43.430 --> 02:26:45.330
I have let him give me a foot massage,

02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.550
and when we go to the movies,
I have let him hold my hand.

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:52.070
Bitch, you might be acting
like you 12 years old,

02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.670
but he just acting like a man.

02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:55.840
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:56.720
Let me get this straight--

02:26:58.290 --> 02:27:01.590
you are not fucking him,
you are not sucking him,

02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:05.540
you are not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:08.580
You know some cultures might say
he made the wiser choice.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.800
[all laughing]

02:27:14.390 --> 02:27:17.830
So Zoe, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:21.240
- LEE: What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.

02:27:21.310 --> 02:27:24.740
And, admittedly,
we are a little fucked up.

02:27:24.810 --> 02:27:27.080
- ZOE: (giggling] Cheers to that.
- Word.

02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:28.590
Cheers.

02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:30.610
So Zoe...

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.630
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:36.760
[others laughing]

02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:40.170
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.880
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:44.750
So I do.

02:27:45.090 --> 02:27:47.420
[imitating Zoe]
Then "A little fu -ther!"

02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:51.500
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:56.240
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

02:27:58.250 --> 02:28:00.680
[others cracking up]
... with God knows how many rocks

02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:04.750
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:07.050
I probably would have broken my neck.

02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:10.860
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoe, you almost killed me!"

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:16.550
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

02:28:16.650 --> 02:28:17.680
and Zoe starts fucking around.

02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:23.260
And... bam!... if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:26.600
LEE: Nice.

02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:28.810
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:32.910
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:36.550
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about. "

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:38.990
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:40.010
What happened?

02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:42.870
What, with Zoe, the cat?

02:28:42.930 --> 02:28:43.740
Nothing.

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.040
If I fell in that fucking thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:50.410
Zoe just lands on her feet.

02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:54.490
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself--

02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:59.810
Zoe falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We are laughing about it.

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:03.840
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:06.510
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:10.420
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoe's.

02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:14.490
Well, physically speaking,
Zoe is amazing.

02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:17.950
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:21.700
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoe on that front.

02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:23.810
Kim, I like you too.

02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:28.560
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoe's prowess,

02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:31.830
you are missing the most
important part of that story.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:35.020
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoe did.

02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:39.410
Zoe even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.380
and she still fell in.

02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:44.470
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:47.360
Hey, I resemble that remark.

02:29:47.770 --> 02:29:49.160
[laughing]

02:29:50.970 --> 02:29:53.070
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

02:29:56.350 --> 02:29:58.180
Check it out, bitch.

02:29:58.250 --> 02:30:00.620
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:01.490
LEE: What's a Roscoe?

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:02.760
Roscoe's a pistol.

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:06.030
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:08.100
You have a license to carry?

02:30:08.170 --> 02:30:12.080
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

02:30:12.810 --> 02:30:14.610
Oh, I didn't know you were...

02:30:17.390 --> 02:30:21.400
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

02:30:22.570 --> 02:30:24.500
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

02:30:24.570 --> 02:30:27.140
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:30.740
Do I know? Yes.

02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:34.480
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:37.430
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:41.100
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

02:30:41.170 --> 02:30:43.900
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:47.780
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

02:30:47.850 --> 02:30:50.760
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:52.520
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:56.300
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

02:30:56.370 --> 02:31:00.370
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:04.710
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

02:31:05.250 --> 02:31:07.050
I wanna shut that nigga down!

02:31:08.930 --> 02:31:11.160
How about a knife, at least?

02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:13.670
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

02:31:15.570 --> 02:31:17.480
They get shot!

02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:21.550
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:25.320
I will hire me a do-dirt nigga and he will
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

02:31:25.390 --> 02:31:28.800
I will sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:32.430
So Zoe, you thought about
what you want to do first?

02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:37.780
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

02:31:37.850 --> 02:31:39.790
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:45.360
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:50.140
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger--
fuck me swinging, balls out.

02:31:50.430 --> 02:31:51.430
[laughing]

02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:55.270
ABBIE: Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

02:31:56.020 --> 02:31:58.420
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

02:31:58.490 --> 02:32:02.860
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

02:32:04.490 --> 02:32:06.490
[cackles]

02:32:06.980 --> 02:32:10.110
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:10.980
No worries, mate.

02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:13.820
I have got it all worked out.

02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:17.130
When I knew I was coming here,
I went on-line and found out

02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:20.660
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:23.500
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:24.710
[grunts]

02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:28.250
What do you mean by that, mate?

02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:31.360
Zoe's from New Zealand,
and you never--

02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:34.920
I repeat, never--
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.700
KIM: That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

02:32:39.610 --> 02:32:41.410
I'm so sorry. I will nev--

02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:42.560
[others snorting]

02:32:42.610 --> 02:32:44.170
Oh, it's okay.

02:32:44.250 --> 02:32:47.350
We are just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:49.090
Auckland, to answer your question.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:53.730
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:57.400
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

02:32:57.480 --> 02:32:59.950
Pipe down and I will tell you.

02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:02.950
I have been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:04.620
looking at cars for sale,

02:33:04.690 --> 02:33:09.290
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

02:33:09.430 --> 02:33:12.700
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

02:33:12.770 --> 02:33:16.070
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.410
KIM: And you wanna buy it?

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:23.360
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

02:33:23.430 --> 02:33:27.430
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he will let me test-drive it.

02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.670
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:32.300
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:36.150
Kowalski from 'Vanishing Point'.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!

02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:37.440
If I can get this guy

02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:41.600
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:43.530
ABBIE: What's 'Vanishing Point'?

02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:46.610
What's 'Vanishing Point'?

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:49.650
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:52.690
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:56.290
Actually, Zoe, most girls
wouldn't know 'Vanishing Point'.

02:33:57.330 --> 02:34:01.330
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:04.930
Yeah, well, we are gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:07.380
Y'all grew up watching
that 'Pretty in Pink' shit.

02:34:07.450 --> 02:34:09.780
Oh, I liked 'Pretty in Pink'.

02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:12.330
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:16.400
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:19.200
'Vanishing Point'. 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry'.

02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:20.830
- 'Gone in 60 Seconds'...
- Oh...

02:34:20.910 --> 02:34:23.880
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:27.680
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays 'Vanishing Point'.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:28.950
'Big Wednesday'. all the classics.

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:32.610
[honks]

02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.990
[honking]

02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:48.760
What do you horny gals want?

02:34:48.810 --> 02:34:49.810
[door opens, slams]

02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:55.670
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:57.170
Right up here, ladies.

02:35:11.850 --> 02:35:14.410
This shit is off the fucking hook!

02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:17.420
Fucking legendary, mate.

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:24.780
Sweet ass. Well, if you will excuse me,
I would like to have a word with my associate.

02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:26.570
You ladies take your time.

02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:28.640
[laughs creepily]

02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:30.330
[moan]

02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:36.490
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:39.160
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:40.040
What?

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.810
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:47.410
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:49.420
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:50.290
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:51.140
Sorry.

02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:54.570
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:57.630
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:59.800
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:02.870
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:04.710
- But...
- But, my ass!

02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:07.810
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:10.950
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:16.040
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:18.280
Now, did you or did you not say that?

02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:22.050
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:25.560
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:27.560
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:31.570
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it--

02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:32.440
Damn skippy you meant it!

02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:35.640
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!

02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:37.740
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:41.820
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

02:36:41.930 --> 02:36:43.620
You are such a liar!

02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:49.190
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I would ever come to America,

02:36:49.370 --> 02:36:52.780
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

02:36:52.850 --> 02:36:56.510
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the 'Vanishing Point' Challenger...

02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:58.720
I would have added a "however. "

02:36:59.490 --> 02:37:01.990
Right?

02:37:05.970 --> 02:37:08.240
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

02:37:08.310 --> 02:37:12.320
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:15.380
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:18.690
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

02:37:26.250 --> 02:37:28.380
I will be your best friend.

02:37:28.450 --> 02:37:31.360
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:33.090
I will crack your back.

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.060
You will crack it anyway.

02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:37.090
Well, of course I will crack it anyway.

02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:41.390
But now, while I'm here,
I will be your back-cracking slave.

02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:43.780
Whenever you want it, you have got it.
You don't even have to ask.

02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:47.960
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:56.250
We are gonna see if this guy will let us
take the car out without him.

02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:59.310
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we will be back in a moment.

02:37:59.890 --> 02:38:00.830
What?

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.370
- I said we are gonna see if this guy will let--
- I heard what you said.

02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.440
I just can't believe
what you said.

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.980
You two got some fucking balls.

02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:12.850
What?

02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:14.900
Don't play dumbass with me.

02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.140
I have been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.900
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fucking around on Tobacco Road,

02:38:23.970 --> 02:38:27.780
but because Zoe wanted to drive
some 'Vanishing Point' car, I'm here.

02:38:27.850 --> 02:38:31.810
Now you two got the balls to ask me--
no, scratch that-- tell me

02:38:31.890 --> 02:38:35.890
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:38.260
Bullshit on that.

02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.360
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:44.350
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

02:38:44.410 --> 02:38:48.080
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:50.890
You are not gonna
want to do what we are doing.

02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:51.760
What, drive a car?

02:38:53.330 --> 02:38:54.130
We are doing more than that.

02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.200
What, drive it fast?

02:38:57.610 --> 02:38:59.270
We are doing more than that.

02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:03.790
Actually, we are paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:05.240
[clears throat]

02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:08.390
But that's okay. We are stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:10.900
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:13.940
- ain't gonna want to do what we are doing.
- How do you know?

02:39:14.010 --> 02:39:16.070
'Cause you are a mum.

02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:16.940
Yeah.

02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:22.950
You know, we are supposed
to be this big posse,

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.930
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.870
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

02:39:29.940 --> 02:39:33.940
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.680
You know, we are kind of conning this guy,

02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:40.450
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:43.020
Besides...

02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:45.430
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

02:39:48.310 --> 02:39:49.900
Okay, how about this?

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:55.230
I will talk him into it,
but I go along.

02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:59.360
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

02:40:00.130 --> 02:40:00.930
But don't worry.

02:40:02.170 --> 02:40:04.230
[snorts] He will say yes.

02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:05.990
What are you gonna do, blow him?

02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:07.310
No.

02:40:09.220 --> 02:40:11.100
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

02:40:11.370 --> 02:40:12.870
[laughing]

02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:17.260
That's a good one.

02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:18.130
Not really.

02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:21.540
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:28.370
Okay, Mama, listen up.

02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:32.590
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:35.500
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

02:40:35.570 --> 02:40:38.600
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:39.810
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

02:40:40.150 --> 02:40:43.980
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

02:40:44.050 --> 02:40:45.270
Agreed.

02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:52.050
Okay. Go work your magic.

02:40:59.050 --> 02:41:00.640
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:02.350
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

02:41:02.420 --> 02:41:04.120
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:05.820
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:08.300
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

02:41:08.370 --> 02:41:11.740
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

02:41:11.810 --> 02:41:13.370
Okay, Abbie.

02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:18.150
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:21.250
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we are comfortable.

02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:22.990
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:25.400
To better sell your automobile.

02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:27.670
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:29.680
Four reasons, actually.

02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:33.750
One, we are not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:37.220
three, we are staying
at the Days Inn in town--

02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:40.890
you can call, check with management.
We are registered for the next month.

02:41:40.970 --> 02:41:45.540
Actually, Zoe's not, but Kim and I are,
so we are totally track-downable.

02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:47.440
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

02:41:48.250 --> 02:41:51.230
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:54.320
And reason number four--
and the most important:

02:41:54.390 --> 02:41:57.330
while we are taking the car out
for a little spin,

02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.400
that will give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:03.510
Lee.

02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:05.560
[chuckles]

02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:09.280
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.350
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

02:42:12.430 --> 02:42:13.240
Hmm.

02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:15.770
Why's she dressed like that?

02:42:15.970 --> 02:42:19.140
Well, you see, we are making
a Hollywood movie in town,

02:42:19.210 --> 02:42:22.150
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:23.880
What's a cheerleader movie?

02:42:23.950 --> 02:42:25.720
A movie about cheerleaders.

02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:28.010
Is it a porno movie?

02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:35.870
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:38.560
[honks]

02:42:40.090 --> 02:42:42.770
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

02:42:42.890 --> 02:42:45.490
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:48.690
KIM: Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

02:42:48.770 --> 02:42:49.570
ZOE: Ta-ta!

02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:52.630
[revving]

02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:56.900
[jasper chuckles slowly]

02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:01.260
Gulp.

02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:17.440
You thinking what I'm thinking?

02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:20.450
I think I'm thinking it.

02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:22.100
What are you and you thinking?

02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:25.940
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:30.710
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:31.590
I gotta take a--

02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:51.260
So, you ready to do this?

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:53.600
You sure?

02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:57.940
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:01.110
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

02:44:01.180 --> 02:44:01.980
Kim!

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:05.050
- I'm just saying.
- If you are gonna take the piss out of it...

02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.780
I'm just saying.

02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:09.860
You wanna start out on top?

02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:14.640
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:17.670
[both laughing]

02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:20.350
[unzips bag]

02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:21.550
Here are your gloves.

02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:30.340
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:32.870
This is my jacket.

02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:36.250
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

02:44:37.350 --> 02:44:40.590
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:43.150
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

02:44:45.490 --> 02:44:46.470
[pop]

02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:54.780
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

02:44:54.850 --> 02:44:55.660
Give me your belt.

02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:05.840
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:09.310
Fine, we will use Abbie's belt.

02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:16.730
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:19.160
Come on, give her the belt.

02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:22.970
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?

02:45:24.010 --> 02:45:25.480
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:30.120
It's nice to be nice, Kim!

02:45:30.190 --> 02:45:32.030
Whatever.

02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:36.100
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.

02:45:36.570 --> 02:45:39.010
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You will ask "pretty please, " bitch,

02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:41.950
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.950
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.

02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:46.010
Don't get on my nerves right now.

02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:48.530
- I got shit on my mind.
- ZOE: Ooh!

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:50.690
You know, I ain't six.

02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:06.030
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:06.900
KIM and ZOE: No.

02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:10.070
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.

02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.100
What the fuck are you guys doing?

02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:34.050
[banging]

02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:35.120
ABBIE: What does that mean?

02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:40.290
Whoa!

02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:47.060
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

02:46:54.930 --> 02:46:57.230
That fast enough for your bony ass?

02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:59.030
Whoo-hoo!

02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:00.920
Whoa ho ho ho!

02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:04.230
Oh!

02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:07.570
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:14.780
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:17.060
Alrighty.

02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:19.300
ABBIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:29.090
[laughing]

02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:32.940
ZOE: Go, go! Go!

02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:36.040
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

02:47:36.390 --> 02:47:37.390
[screaming]

02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:51.240
Whoo-hoo!

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.710
Yah hoo hoo!

02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.270
##

02:48:02.730 --> 02:48:04.820
Yah hoo hoo!

02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:07.220
[chuckling]

02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:30.780
[laughing]

02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:54.770
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.

02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:57.220
[crashing, screaming]

02:49:01.310 --> 02:49:02.130
Damn it!

02:49:11.330 --> 02:49:12.130
Now.

02:49:13.810 --> 02:49:16.140
Did you do something to him?
Say something?

02:49:16.210 --> 02:49:18.410
Nothing! Shit.

02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:20.280
Here he comes, Zoe.
He's coming!

02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:21.150
Aah!

02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:22.680
[skidding]

02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:24.490
Shit, oh shit!

02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:25.790
No!
