10:14.322 --> 10:16.906
YOU KNOW I HAVE
AN IRRITABLE BOWEL.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.012
YOU SHOULD
HAVE MADE A HAM.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.890
OH, BOY, GRANDMA, THAT WAS
A GREAT SERVICE THIS MORNING,

10:42.058 --> 10:43.099
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.977
WELL, I THINK THE PASTOR TALKED
TOO MUCH ABOUT FORGIVENESS.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.482
SOME PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE FORGIVEN.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.151
THIS IS WHY THEOLOGY
IS SUCH A RICH TOPIC...

10:53.319 --> 10:55.904
YOU KNOW, BERNICE, SOME PEOPLE
DON'T NEED FORGIVENESS.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.031
THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE
UNDERSTANDING.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.784
OH, TOO TRUE,
HAVE YOU SEEN GODSPELL?

11:02.244 --> 11:04.329
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

11:04.497 --> 11:06.790
IS HOW IN HELL
A BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN

11:06.957 --> 11:09.209
LIKE MY RED COULD HAVE
THROWN AWAY EVERYTHING...

11:09.377 --> 11:10.960
GRANDMA, WHY DON'T
WE GO INTO THE LIVING ROOM

11:11.128 --> 11:13.088
AND I'LL RUB YOUR FEET?

11:17.551 --> 11:19.886
WHAT A WONDERFUL BOY! OH!

11:20.054 --> 11:21.930
LOOK AT HOW THIN YOU ARE.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.641
IS YOUR MOTHER
FEEDING YOU ENOUGH?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.351
YOU SHOULD COME
AND LIVE WITH ME.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.103
HA, HA, AHH... NO.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.190
OH, HI. I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY TO THE GARAGE

11:32.358 --> 11:35.402
TO, UH, FIX... THIS.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.154
DAD, JUST WATCH YOUR GAME.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.783
NAH, NAH. IT'S JUST
THE PACKERS. UH...

11:42.868 --> 11:44.953
ERIC, WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN HIDING?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.913
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME HOMEWORK.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.248
OH, THAT'S IMPORTANT.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.749
YEAH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY
IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING...

11:49.917 --> 11:53.962
ERIC, A LITTLE LESS TALK
AND A LITTLE MORE RUBBING.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.716
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
NOT AFRAID OF MY BUNION.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.384
OH BOY.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.637
AAH. AAH. OOH.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.890
GOOD-BYE, ERIC.
I AM GOING HOME NOW.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.394
NO! I MEAN, FEZ,
YOU HAVEN'T MET GRANDMA.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.105
OH, HELLO, GRANDMA.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.568
OH, IN MY VILLAGE,
WE WORSHIP FEET.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.739
AND THESE DOGS
ARE A HOLY TREASURE.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.032
YOU WANT TO RUB THEM?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.117
MAY I?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.578
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

12:32.001 --> 12:36.713
OHH! OHH! OHH!

12:36.881 --> 12:39.591
OHH! OHH!

12:46.640 --> 12:47.348
HEY, DAD.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.935
DAMN IT, ERIC!

12:51.103 --> 12:56.649
DON'T SNEAK UP ON A PERSON LIKE
THAT WHEN THEY'RE DOING... THIS.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.276
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.153
I RUBBED HER FEET.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.363
WELL, YOU'RE A BRAVE ONE.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.116
BETTER GET BACK IN THERE.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.745
HEY, DAD,
YOU COMING BACK INSIDE?

13:08.913 --> 13:13.833
ERIC... I LOVE YOUR GRANDMOTHER
VERY, VERY MUCH.

13:14.001 --> 13:18.463
I JUST CAN'T TALK TO HER
OR SPEND ANY TIME WITH HER.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.842
DID I MENTION THAT I'M
IN THERE RUBBING HER FEET?

13:23.010 --> 13:24.302
YOU KNOW, SON,

13:24.470 --> 13:28.765
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT
TO PLAY THROUGH THE PAIN.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.643
WHAT?

13:31.811 --> 13:32.519
I DON'T KNOW.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.813
JUST GET BACK IN THERE.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.232
WITH THEIR
SUGAR-COATED IDEALS

13:37.399 --> 13:40.235
DESIGNED TO ANESTHETIZE
THE IGNORANT MASSES.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.488
WHY? SO THAT THE
MILITARY/CORPORATE BRANCHES

13:43.656 --> 13:46.449
COULD CARRY OUT
WORLD DOMINATION.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.910
ALL RIGHT.
READ THAT BACK TO ME.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.162
OK.
[CLEARS THROAT]

13:51.330 --> 13:55.708
WOH WOH WOH WOH WOH.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.919
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT?

13:58.087 --> 14:00.004
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST USE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.090
OH, OH, YOU JUST
WANT TO VOMIT UP FACTS

14:02.258 --> 14:03.550
FROM AN ENCYCLOPEDIA?

14:03.717 --> 14:04.467
YES.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.052
OK. FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? VOMIT AWAY.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.263
I WILL NOT BE
A PART OF THIS, THEN.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.140
ERIC, ARE YOU DOWN HERE?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.350
HE'S NOT DOWN HERE,
MRS. FORMAN.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.227
DONNA, GOOD, WHY DON'T YOU
COME UP AND EAT WITH US?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.687
I NEED ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.064
NOT YOU, STEVEN.
GRANDMA DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.692
YOU LUCKY BASTARD.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.985
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO EAT?

14:22.152 --> 14:26.614
OH, UM, YOU KNOW HELP
YOURSELF TO THE DEEP FREEZE.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.367
BUT EVERYTHING'S FROZEN.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.246
AND I HAVE A DRYER.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.340
HONEY, THESE, UH,
CHEESY POTATOES ARE DELICIOUS.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.677
MMM.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.805
THANK YOU, HONEY.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.350
THEY REALLY ARE GREAT,
MRS. FORMAN.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.604
WE HAVE THEM WHENEVER
GRANDMA COMES OVER,

14:57.771 --> 15:01.524
'CAUSE MOM KNOWS HOW MUCH
SHE LOVES THEM, RIGHT, GRANDMA?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.986
THEY MAKE ME SICK.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.655
I'M ALLERGIC TO DAIRY.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.742
OH, HOW SAD.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.660
MA, THIS IS WISCONSIN.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.663
YOU'RE NOT
ALLERGIC TO DAIRY.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.374
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S JUST
ALLERGIC TO MY DAIRY. HA HA.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.668
IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO DAIRY,

15:20.836 --> 15:22.295
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING
CREAM IN YOUR COFFEE.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.212
I MEAN, CREAM IS DAIRY.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.549
DONNA, I JUST...
NO, NO, NO, OK?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.176
YOU SHUT UP, ERIC.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.220
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

15:31.388 --> 15:34.891
GRANDMA, THAT'S DONNA.
YOU'VE KNOWN HER FOR 16 YEARS.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.684
I HAVE NOT.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.520
ANYWAY, I LIKE
YOUR NEW FRIEND BETTER.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.982
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.193
DONE!

15:45.361 --> 15:48.404
I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE
IN THE, UH, GARAGE.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.406
RACCOONS.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.200
BYE.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.121
WELL, UM, I COULDN'T
EAT ANOTHER BITE.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.415
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.086
I'M GOING BACK DOWNSTAIRS.
EXCUSE ME.

16:03.253 --> 16:08.257
SO, LET'S SAY WE WATCH
LAWRENCE WELK, HUH, GRANDMA?

16:08.425 --> 16:09.550
NO, I'M GOING TO WATCH
LAWRENCE WELK

16:09.718 --> 16:11.302
WITH MY NEW FRIEND.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.597
YOU UP FOR ANOTHER
FOOT RUB, DESI?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.602
OOH... FRY TIME

16:21.730 --> 16:22.772
HOT, HOT.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.439
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.692
HUH? UH... JUST WORKING
ON YOUR REPORT HERE

16:25.859 --> 16:27.819
AND... HAVING SOME FRIES.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.238
YOU PUT FRENCH FRIES
IN MY MOM'S DRYER?

16:30.406 --> 16:33.866
YEAH, WELL, THE FISH STICKS
ARE TOO FLAKY, SO I JUST...

16:34.034 --> 16:35.618
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.913
FINALLY.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.623
WHERE HAVE
YOU GUYS BEEN?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.875
WE HAD TO LOOK
FOR THE PAPER.

16:43.043 --> 16:43.918
AND...

16:44.086 --> 16:46.295
EAT, AND THEN SOME
STUFF HAPPENED, YOU KNOW.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.505
YOUR SHIRT'S ON
INSIDE OUT.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.883
YEAH, THAT'S... THE STUFF.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.135
WHERE'S THE PAPER?

16:52.302 --> 16:53.302
RIGHT. OK, SEE,

16:53.470 --> 16:55.722
IT WASN'T ON THE THREE
BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.849
IT WAS ON THE
FOUR FOOD GROUPS.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.186
OK, LOOK, MY DAD'S
GOT THE WORLD BOOKS.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.604
I'LL JUST RUN NEXT DOOR
AND GET "G."

17:03.772 --> 17:05.565
OOH. I'LL GO WITH YOU.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.444
YOU CAN BREAK UP
WITH HER NOW.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.905
YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED
OF EVERYBODY

17:13.073 --> 17:16.743
TRYING TO TEAR
ME AND JACKIE APART!

17:16.910 --> 17:20.580
MORON. EVERY DAY YOU SAY
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH HER.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.917
WELL... YOU GUYS
DON'T KNOW HER LIKE I DO.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.796
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT FOOLIN' AROUND.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.174
SHE BUYS ME STUFF.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.844
SHE HOOVERED
YOUR CHEST, MAN.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.055
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:37.222 --> 17:39.348
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.309
ALL I WANTED WAS
A LITTLE HELP WITH MY PAPER,

17:41.477 --> 17:42.769
AND YOU'VE DONE NOTHING.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.605
WE PUT YOUR
MIDDLE NAME IN.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.858
JEAN-CLAUDE?

17:49.026 --> 17:51.527
YEAH. IT'S TWO WORDS.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.321
YOU GUYS SUCK!

17:53.489 --> 17:55.448
JUST... THANK GOD FOR DONNA.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.701
OK. BAD NEWS.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.411
MY MOM SOLD SOME
AT A GARAGE SALE,

18:00.579 --> 18:03.956
BUT WE HAVE
"B," "X," AND "R."

18:04.124 --> 18:06.084
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.960
NOW, YOU LISTEN UP.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.838
I HAVE HAD AN
EXTREMELY STRESSFUL DAY,

18:11.006 --> 18:12.840
AND I AM NOT PROUD
OF WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY,

18:13.008 --> 18:15.051
BUT SOMEONE
GIVE ME A CIGARETTE.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.804
NOW!

18:17.971 --> 18:20.014
BUT, MOM,
WE DON'T SMOKE.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.724
CUT THE CRAP, ERIC.

18:21.892 --> 18:22.975
I AM A NURSE.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.686
I KNOW THAT ONE IN FIVE
TEENAGERS SMOKE.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.814
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

18:27.981 --> 18:30.316
NOW, I AM GOING
TO CLOSE MY EYES,

18:30.484 --> 18:31.526
AND WHEN I OPEN THEM,

18:31.693 --> 18:34.695
THERE HAD BETTER BE A CIGARETTE
BETWEEN THESE TWO FINGERS.

18:34.863 --> 18:39.492
COME ON, PEOPLE, HOP TO!

18:39.660 --> 18:40.952
THANK YOU.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.830
LIGHT!

18:45.124 --> 18:46.332
Red: KITTY!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.667
KITTY!

18:47.835 --> 18:49.335
KITTY?

18:49.503 --> 18:52.046
OH, THERE YOU ARE, RED.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.297
MA SAYS
THE CAT BIT HER,

18:53.465 --> 18:55.174
SO I'M DOWN HERE
LOOKIN' FOR IT.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.553
DAD, WE DON'T HAVE A CAT.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.596
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.860
WELL, UH...

19:14.027 --> 19:15.111
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY...
WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE

19:15.279 --> 19:28.583
YOUR POOR LITTLE FOREIGN FRIEND
UP THERE ALONE WITH GRANDMA.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.295
SO, REALLY,
IT'S KIND OF NICE DOWN HERE.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.429
[LAUGHING]

19:41.597 --> 19:44.682
OH, THANK YOU FOR
A WONDERFUL DINNER.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.226
WELL, YOU ARE
SO VERY WELCOME.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.478
I HOPE I WASN'T ANY BOTHER.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.063
OH, MA, YOU'RE NO BOTHER.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.316
YOU'RE AS WELCOME AS...

19:53.483 --> 19:56.110
FLOWERS IN MAY.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.820
BERNICE, HERE,
I WRAPPED UP SOME CHICKEN

19:57.988 --> 19:58.946
FOR YOU TO TAKE HOME.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.699
OHH, THANK YOU, DEAR.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.785
AND I... I HOPE YOU PUT SOME OF
THOSE CHEESY POTATOES IN THERE.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.246
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVE THEM.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.457
WHAT?!

20:09.625 --> 20:10.708
I THOUGHT YOU MADE
SUCH A BIG DEAL

20:10.876 --> 20:11.792
ABOUT HOW YOU
WERE ALLERGIC TO...

20:11.960 --> 20:13.252
Red: ERIC!

20:13.420 --> 20:14.378
IT'S BEEN A
PERFECTLY NICE SUNDAY.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.505
LET'S NOT SPOIL IT.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.928
SWEETHEART, I HOPE
I DIDN'T MAKE TOO BIG A DEAL

20:22.095 --> 20:23.512
ABOUT MY ALLERGY.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.389
OH, NO, MA.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.308
HE'S A KID.
HE, UH...

20:27.476 --> 20:28.851
HE OVERREACTS.

20:30.187 --> 20:34.190
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE CUTEST LITTLE CAR.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.859
I JUST LOVE IT.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.448
825, 826...

20:42.616 --> 20:43.616
ERIC?

20:43.784 --> 20:44.450
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.118
IT'S 1 O'CLOCK
IN THE MORNING.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.955
I'M JUST FINISHING UP
SOME HOMEWORK.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.498
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN HERE?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.583
OH, WELL, UM...

20:52.751 --> 20:56.921
SNOW WHITE CAME DOWN
TO GUN A STICK.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.048
LOOK, MOM, I... I WISH
YOU WOULDN'T SMOKE.

20:59.216 --> 21:03.261
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THIS IS MY LAST ONE, I PROMISE.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.682
BY THE WAY, UM...

21:07.849 --> 21:10.518
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
WITH YOUR GRANDMA TODAY.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.435
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.229
MM-HMM.

21:13.397 --> 21:17.191
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE
AGAINST YOU, MOM?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.110
WELL...

21:19.278 --> 21:21.404
ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO,
YOUR FATHER WAS DATING

21:21.571 --> 21:25.658
THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE
WELL-TO-DO WOMAN

21:25.826 --> 21:28.953
THAT YOUR GRANDMA LIKED,
AND, UM...

21:29.121 --> 21:31.956
HE MARRIED ME INSTEAD.
