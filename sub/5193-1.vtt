02:07.000 --> 02:10.197
If I don't draw for a while,
I get really crazy.

02:10.270 --> 02:14.365
I start feeling depressed and suicidal
if I don't get to draw.

02:15.441 --> 02:18.637
But sometimes when I'm drawing,
I feel suicidal, too.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.871
What are you trying to get at
in your work?

02:20.945 --> 02:22.435
Jesus!

02:24.316 --> 02:26.010
I don't know.

02:27.551 --> 02:30.714
I don't work in terms of conscious
messages. I can't do that.

02:30.788 --> 02:33.278
It has to be something...

02:33.356 --> 02:36.655
I'm revealing to myself while
I'm doing it, which is hard to explain.

02:36.726 --> 02:40.024
Which means that while I'm doing it,
I don't know exactly what it's about.

02:40.095 --> 02:44.623
You have to have the courage
to take that chance.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.633
What's gonna come out?

02:46.701 --> 02:49.226
What's coming out of this?

02:49.303 --> 02:51.237
I enjoy drawing.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.762
It's a deeply ingrained habit.
It's all because of my brother Charles.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.235
Hello, Mother?
I'm in Philadelphia.

03:00.946 --> 03:06.316
I'm going to give a talk
at the art school downtown tomorrow.

03:06.385 --> 03:09.945
So Terry and this film crew
are here with me.

03:10.021 --> 03:14.548
They'd like to come over
and drop me off there...

03:14.624 --> 03:18.253
and talk possibly to Charles...

03:18.328 --> 03:21.125
about maybe filming him
if you're not...

03:22.198 --> 03:25.599
He doesn't want to do it?
Okay.

03:27.136 --> 03:29.126
All right.

03:29.204 --> 03:30.899
That's okay.

03:30.972 --> 03:32.462
Doesn't matter.

03:33.942 --> 03:37.274
Not if you don't want him to.
I certainly won't...

03:39.813 --> 03:42.213
All right. Bye.

03:45.385 --> 03:47.979
Well, that's that.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.051
I start with this one...

03:58.129 --> 04:02.190
because it's probably the thing
I'm most well-known for.

04:02.266 --> 04:07.259
You could see it for a long time
on truck mud flaps.

04:07.337 --> 04:09.862
I don't know why it caught
the popular imagination.

04:09.939 --> 04:13.704
It caused me nothing but headaches
for ten years after I drew it:

04:13.776 --> 04:16.540
lawsuits and I.R.S. problems.

04:16.612 --> 04:18.875
It was a nightmare just because
of this stupid ‘‘Keep on truckin’’.

04:18.946 --> 04:23.178
So don't anybody come to me and say,
‘‘Hey, R.! Keep on truckin!’’

04:23.251 --> 04:26.378
This is probably the next thing...

04:26.453 --> 04:28.387
I'm most well-known for.

04:28.455 --> 04:30.855
I'm trying to hook you in
to who I am.

04:30.924 --> 04:34.154
This sold millions of copies.
I got $600...

04:34.226 --> 04:37.992
from CBS records in 1968.

04:38.063 --> 04:43.625
And they kept my artwork.
They stole my artwork, those bastards.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.567
I heard recently
that the original of this...

04:46.637 --> 04:50.630
sold at Sotheby's for $21,000.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.875
This is the third thing
I'm the most well-known for...

04:55.945 --> 04:59.278
because this was made into
a major full-length animated cartoon...

04:59.348 --> 05:03.010
which was an embarrassment to me
for the rest of my life.

05:03.084 --> 05:05.746
I have to say I had nothing to do
with the cartoon.

05:05.821 --> 05:09.256
I didn't want them to do it.
I thought they were schlockmeisters.

05:09.323 --> 05:12.053
They just rolled right over me.

05:12.126 --> 05:17.222
So I had this character killed in a
later story. I had a female ostrich...

05:17.297 --> 05:21.232
stab him in the head with an ice pick.

05:22.234 --> 05:25.692
When I first met him,
he never talked, he just drew.

05:25.771 --> 05:29.001
He was catatonic,
and the only voice he had was his pen.

05:29.073 --> 05:31.439
He was very productive.

05:31.509 --> 05:34.342
My mother thought he was retarded
when she met him.

05:34.412 --> 05:38.108
She said, ‘‘Some people like cripples,
some like retards.’’

05:39.182 --> 05:41.776
She thought I was a real creep
when she first met me.

05:41.852 --> 05:46.686
He's more comfortable after knowing
the same people for a long time.

05:46.755 --> 05:48.689
He's a little more communicative...

05:48.757 --> 05:51.190
but still he clams up.

05:51.259 --> 05:55.059
He gets stilted in his conversation
around anybody he doesn't know well.

05:55.129 --> 05:57.619
That's why I'm such
an exciting subject for a movie.

05:57.698 --> 05:59.131
Right.

06:06.005 --> 06:07.939
Watch out with those weights.

06:08.007 --> 06:12.739
- Don't hit me with those things.
- Don't go behind me.

06:12.811 --> 06:16.372
These rich rednecks have moved out here
and built their dream homes...

06:16.448 --> 06:18.438
on the top of every single hill.

06:18.516 --> 06:22.646
There used to be nothing over here.
Then these people bought this property.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.914
- They might hear you.
- Look at this house.

06:24.988 --> 06:28.287
- Not too loud.
- Right above our house.

06:28.358 --> 06:31.054
- Looks right into Robert's studio.
- Be quiet.

06:31.127 --> 06:33.617
I don't care if they hear me.

06:33.695 --> 06:37.062
Couldn't be any ruder than them
putting their house right above mine.

06:37.132 --> 06:39.429
What do I care?

06:39.500 --> 06:43.334
I guess not, since we're moving
to France, what do you care?

06:43.404 --> 06:47.931
They have a plan to widen this road and
put it through where these trees are.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.704
There's a big X that
the surveyors sprayed on here...

06:50.777 --> 06:53.006
and I erased it the other day.

06:53.078 --> 06:56.343
Then I took out their sticks
from the other side of the road.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.349
They're going to widen this road...

06:58.417 --> 07:01.544
and take a big chunk of land
out of that side with all these trees.

07:01.619 --> 07:03.951
Put 12 dream homes back in there.

07:04.022 --> 07:08.617
We decided to chain ourselves to these
oak trees if they try and take them out.

07:08.692 --> 07:13.186
Our house is so humble
nestled against the hill. Tasteful.

07:13.263 --> 07:16.857
All these other houses are oriented
to look down at our place...

07:16.933 --> 07:20.835
because it's like a backdrop for
their air-conditioned nightmare houses.

07:20.902 --> 07:24.463
Each hilltop can view
each other hilltop. The shmucks.

07:36.516 --> 07:41.385
I'm drawing portraits of girls I had
crushes on in high school in Delaware.

07:41.454 --> 07:43.614
This one I'm drawing now
is Winona Newhouse...

07:43.689 --> 07:46.886
affectionately known among the boys
as ‘‘The Shelf’’.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.859
She had this phenomenal rear shelf.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.361
She was nice, too, actually.
She was kind to me.

07:54.565 --> 07:56.532
This one here, Naomi Wilson...

07:56.600 --> 07:59.728
was this cross-eyed farm girl
that wore homemade clothes.

07:59.803 --> 08:03.568
I secretly had a crush on her.
I was sexually attracted to her.

08:03.639 --> 08:06.631
Of course, you'd never dare
admit it openly...

08:06.709 --> 08:11.077
that you like this funky girl
that had B.O. and hairy legs.

08:12.146 --> 08:16.515
That's Jean Strahle. I liked her, too.
She was also considered a dork.

08:16.584 --> 08:18.608
She was a bookwormy type
that talked with a lisp...

08:18.685 --> 08:20.653
and had shapely, powerful legs.

08:20.721 --> 08:22.746
I never actually had any contact
with these girls...

08:22.823 --> 08:25.791
except I used to play footsie
with this one.

08:26.626 --> 08:28.719
Where are they now?

08:28.794 --> 08:31.024
Thirty years ago.

08:31.097 --> 08:34.623
They're all middle-aged housewives now.
Jesus, what a thought.

08:36.267 --> 08:39.496
Winona. I wish she was here now...

08:39.570 --> 08:41.868
this 17-year-old Winona...

08:41.938 --> 08:44.806
instead of this film crew.

08:53.782 --> 08:56.876
When I listen to old music,
it's one of the few times...

08:56.952 --> 08:59.546
I actually have a kind of love
for humanity.

08:59.620 --> 09:03.488
You hear the best part of the soul
of the common people.

09:03.557 --> 09:06.719
It's their way of expressing...

09:06.793 --> 09:09.557
their connection to eternity
or whatever you want to call it.

09:09.629 --> 09:13.030
Modern music doesn't have
that calamitous loss.

09:13.099 --> 09:16.261
People can't express themselves
that way anymore.

11:43.427 --> 11:45.759
It was late 1948...

11:45.830 --> 11:49.265
when I was five years old, we moved
to this section of Philadelphia.

11:49.332 --> 11:52.324
This is this project that we lived in.

11:52.402 --> 11:55.894
I can't remember which we lived in.
They all look the same.

11:57.106 --> 11:59.097
Jesus. It's grim here.

11:59.175 --> 12:02.576
Oh, my God! This is where
we went to the market.

12:02.645 --> 12:05.340
There was a dime store
that sold toys there.

12:05.413 --> 12:10.111
We used to buy candy and stuff
and comic books.

12:10.184 --> 12:14.621
The three brothers, me, Charles
and Maxon, hung around together a lot.

12:14.688 --> 12:19.715
We'd rummage for stuff in the dump.

12:19.792 --> 12:23.023
One time Charles brought this thing
back from the dump.

12:23.095 --> 12:25.426
It was this beautiful wooden truck.

12:25.497 --> 12:29.627
Like an ice cream truck made of wood.
I wanted it really bad.

12:29.701 --> 12:32.931
He wouldn't let me touch it.
He was spiteful that way.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.437
So I made a big fuss,
and I told my mother.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.940
She said, ‘‘Charles,
let him play with that.’’

12:38.008 --> 12:39.440
He said, ‘‘Okay.’’

12:39.509 --> 12:44.139
About 15 minutes later, he said,
‘‘Okay, you can play with it now.’’

12:44.214 --> 12:48.741
I ran outside, and he had smashed it
to smithereens against the wall.

13:04.831 --> 13:07.958
Charles, you read
any good books lately?

13:09.034 --> 13:11.867
Yeah, I guess I have.
I don't know.

13:13.172 --> 13:17.005
You seem to be recycling
a lot of these books.

13:17.075 --> 13:20.010
What do you mean by ‘‘recycling’’?

13:20.078 --> 13:23.342
You read them 20 years ago.
Now you're reading them again.

13:23.413 --> 13:25.574
I'm reading them again. Yeah.

13:25.649 --> 13:28.879
I do that because
there's nothing else to do.

13:28.951 --> 13:31.818
You've read them all.
You ever read anything new?

13:31.888 --> 13:34.413
I haven't read Kant or Hegel.

13:34.490 --> 13:39.688
- You have any interest in that stuff?
- Maybe I'll get around to reading them.

13:39.761 --> 13:43.787
- You read any recent writers?
- Not really, no.

13:43.864 --> 13:48.823
- Not interested in them?
- Most aren't that good or interesting.

13:48.902 --> 13:53.305
They're not as interesting
as the Victorian writers...

13:53.373 --> 13:56.637
of the late 19th century.

13:56.708 --> 13:59.370
I always kind of envied your life
in a way.

13:59.444 --> 14:01.912
My life has become so hectic.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.573
Why? Because I was so detached
from the human race?

14:04.649 --> 14:06.879
Is that one of the reasons
why you envy me?

14:06.951 --> 14:09.078
This cloistered environment
with your books.

14:09.153 --> 14:12.178
Believe me, it's nothing to envy.

14:14.691 --> 14:18.091
Charles started this comic thing.

14:18.160 --> 14:21.254
He was completely obsessed with comics
when we were kids...

14:21.330 --> 14:23.958
and had absolutely no other
normal kid interest.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.262
He wasn't interested in toys or games.

14:26.334 --> 14:28.461
He didn't play sports.

14:28.536 --> 14:33.268
He didn't do anything but read comics,
draw comics, think comics and talk them.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.174
I like drawing, but I had other
drawing interests besides comics.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.770
I liked to draw realistic scenes...

14:40.846 --> 14:43.542
just pictures of buildings
and cars and stuff.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.913
He wasn't interested in that at all.
It was only comics.

14:45.984 --> 14:51.513
This is the earliest one that still
exists that I have. Charles drew this.

14:51.589 --> 14:54.682
That's supposed to be me,
and that's him.

14:56.226 --> 14:58.990
You made me feel absolutely worthless
if I wasn't drawing comics.

14:59.063 --> 15:04.125
I don't think I would have done that.
I don't think I was as far gone as that.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.363
Maybe I was just unconsciously
imitating the old man.

15:09.805 --> 15:14.173
- What was he like?
- My father was an overbearing tyrant.

15:15.509 --> 15:17.272
Yes, he was.

15:17.345 --> 15:21.576
Maybe I was unconsciously imitating him
when I forced you to draw comic books.

15:23.183 --> 15:27.812
There's still a kind of sibling rivalry
between me and Robert...

15:27.886 --> 15:31.515
like there was when we were kids
and he was still living at home.

15:31.590 --> 15:35.616
I think basically Robert and I
are still competing with each other.

15:35.693 --> 15:39.629
It's like when I'm drawing comics,
I still think of Charles' approval...

15:39.697 --> 15:42.563
whether or not he's going to like them.

15:42.632 --> 15:46.363
Charles had everybody drawing comics
in the family.

15:46.436 --> 15:48.733
‘‘The Animal Town Publishing Company.’’

15:48.804 --> 15:50.738
That was a club we had...

15:50.806 --> 15:54.572
where we sat around
and talked about comics.

15:54.643 --> 15:59.306
I was usually the president.
Robert was usually the vice president.

15:59.381 --> 16:02.077
Carol was usually the secretary...

16:02.150 --> 16:06.518
and Sandy was the treasurer
and Maxon was the supply boy.

16:10.156 --> 16:12.386
And he still resents that.

16:12.458 --> 16:16.690
He still resents the fact we imposed
the role of supply boy on him.

16:36.146 --> 16:38.807
Max Crumb in room 310?

16:49.490 --> 16:52.947
Maxon was the scapegoat in the family.

16:53.026 --> 16:57.554
Of five kids, he was definitely
on the bottom of the heap.

16:57.631 --> 16:59.359
Just to explain...

16:59.432 --> 17:03.061
we had these meetings for this club
Charles put together called...

17:03.135 --> 17:05.729
The Animal Town Comics Club.

17:05.805 --> 17:07.964
Something to do with comics.

17:08.039 --> 17:13.271
Everybody had their job, a secretary,
a president, a vice president.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.607
I was supply boy.

17:17.114 --> 17:21.777
I got it more heavy or direct than
Robert, but there was the whole thing.

17:21.851 --> 17:25.810
It was like a crazy sibling thing
between me, Charles and Robert...

17:25.887 --> 17:27.820
in this room upstairs...

17:27.888 --> 17:30.153
and the world didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

17:30.225 --> 17:34.991
It was like three primordial monkeys
working it out in the trees.

17:35.062 --> 17:39.431
Me and Maxon slept in the same bed
until we were 16 or something.

17:39.500 --> 17:43.060
Very intimate, close situation.

17:48.707 --> 17:51.437
Charles was inspired
by the Disney movie...

17:51.510 --> 17:53.978
where Robert Newton plays
Long John Silver.

17:54.046 --> 17:56.878
After we saw it on TV in 1955...

17:56.948 --> 18:00.281
we started playing pirates
like normal kids do.

18:00.351 --> 18:02.910
We'd go out and pretend.

18:02.986 --> 18:06.422
We made this ship
out of an old refrigerator carton.

18:06.490 --> 18:10.289
Charles would walk around town
dressed up like Long John Silver.

18:10.359 --> 18:13.351
He had this old coat of my mother's,
this long, green coat.

18:13.429 --> 18:16.193
He made himself a three-cornered hat
out of some woman's hat.

18:16.265 --> 18:20.360
He had a crutch, and he'd tie up his leg
and go around town that way.

18:20.435 --> 18:24.200
I didn't realize how fixated Charles was
on ‘‘Treasure Island’’ till years later.

18:24.271 --> 18:29.436
This thing dominated our play
and our fantasy for six or seven years.

18:29.510 --> 18:31.500
We drew these comics...

18:31.577 --> 18:35.638
about ‘‘Treasure Island, ’' and it became
this real Baroque, elaborate thing...

18:35.715 --> 18:39.047
way beyond the original Disney film.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.551
This is one of Charles'.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.111
This is one of our two-man comics
in which he would draw...

18:45.189 --> 18:48.852
some of the characters and I would
draw some and have them interact.

18:48.926 --> 18:52.417
That was a great school
of cartooning for me...

18:52.495 --> 18:56.727
having to come up
with clever retorts to him.

18:56.799 --> 19:00.290
He was actually much cleverer
and funnier than I was.

19:00.369 --> 19:05.272
It got tiresome, but you had to do it.
He was in charge.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.103
I had this very definite,
bad problem about Charles.

19:08.176 --> 19:13.272
I think a lot of it had to do
with my morbid sensitivity to the guy...

19:13.346 --> 19:17.407
as well as his natural affinity
to get in there and profit off it.

19:17.484 --> 19:19.679
Robert was somewhat of a middleman.

19:19.753 --> 19:22.380
It had this way of restricting...

19:22.454 --> 19:26.288
or causing this terrible
self-consciousness in me as a kid.

19:26.358 --> 19:31.556
I was morbidly modest about my body.
Sex was completely removed.

19:31.629 --> 19:35.894
When it came time for me to become
sexually aware when I was in puberty...

19:35.966 --> 19:39.925
Sex was nowhere near in my life.
I had absolutely nothing to do with it.

19:40.003 --> 19:44.336
Sex was so heavily repressed.
That's when the seizures started.

19:44.407 --> 19:48.775
I had a seizure. And a seizure's like
a point where your behavior becomes...

19:48.843 --> 19:52.574
I'd have to get into the whole sex trip,
which is an awful involved topic.

19:52.647 --> 19:57.310
All I thought about when I was
in my late teens and early 20s was sex.

19:57.384 --> 20:02.912
I masturbated about four or five times
a week. How frequently did you...

20:02.989 --> 20:07.016
I don't masturbate anymore now that
my sexual desires are completely dead.

20:07.093 --> 20:10.255
Like I told you,
I can't get an erection anymore.

20:10.329 --> 20:11.762
My God!

20:13.465 --> 20:17.924
I don't know whether it's one thing
or a combination of things.

20:18.002 --> 20:22.098
Maybe a combination of the medication
and lack of external stimulation.

20:22.173 --> 20:27.439
Maybe approaching old age
has something to do with it. Who knows?

20:27.510 --> 20:31.343
You need some external stimulation
to keep up your interest.

20:31.413 --> 20:35.782
Now that my sexual desires are gone,
I'm not sure I want them back again.

20:37.952 --> 20:40.648
My earliest sexual memories?

20:42.423 --> 20:47.587
I remember being like four years old
and getting erections.

20:47.661 --> 20:51.062
I guess my aunt or my mother's sister...

20:51.131 --> 20:54.657
Humping her legs and her shoes
like under the table.

20:54.734 --> 20:57.828
I remember going in my mother's closet.
She had cowboy boots...

20:57.903 --> 21:00.632
she wore when it rained...

21:00.705 --> 21:03.299
and humping those in the closet.

21:03.375 --> 21:06.071
And I remember singing while doing it.

21:06.143 --> 21:08.668
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

21:08.746 --> 21:11.943
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

21:14.117 --> 21:15.550
I remember...

21:15.618 --> 21:19.554
when I was about five or six
I was sexually attracted to Bugs Bunny.

21:19.622 --> 21:22.590
I cut out this Bugs Bunny
off the cover of a comic book...

21:22.658 --> 21:25.855
and carried it around with me
in my pocket...

21:25.927 --> 21:29.157
and took it out
and looked at it periodically.

21:29.230 --> 21:32.028
It got wrinkled from handling.

21:32.099 --> 21:36.967
I asked my mother to iron it
to flatten it out.

21:37.037 --> 21:40.939
She did, and I was deeply disappointed
because it got all brown and brittle...

21:41.007 --> 21:43.236
and it crumbled apart.

21:43.309 --> 21:45.800
What was it about Bugs Bunny
that you found exciting?

21:45.878 --> 21:50.314
I had this sexual attraction
to cute cartoon characters.

21:51.916 --> 21:53.850
You tell me!
I don't know.

21:56.386 --> 22:00.345
That all changed when I turned 12,
and I became fixated on Sheena.

22:03.292 --> 22:08.787
‘‘Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, ’'
a TV show around '55, '56.

22:14.402 --> 22:16.892
I became totally obsessed with Sheena
and went to bed every night...

22:16.970 --> 22:21.907
thinking about the things
I wanted to do with Sheena.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.780
Robert was very hung up on sex
when he was a little kid...

22:30.849 --> 22:32.976
even more so than I was.

22:34.052 --> 22:36.350
- I was? You think so?
- Yeah.

22:36.421 --> 22:41.517
You were more inhibited as a child
than I was, even sexually.

22:41.592 --> 22:46.722
You were more afraid of women than I was
as a young person.

22:46.796 --> 22:49.822
When I was in high school,
I had a few dates with girls.

22:49.899 --> 22:54.028
When you were in high school,
you didn't have any dates with anybody.

22:54.103 --> 22:56.264
You were actually
sort of good-Iooking.

22:56.338 --> 23:00.535
I was a handsome, good-Iooking chap
when I was a teenager.

23:00.608 --> 23:04.237
But there was just something
that was wrong with my personality.

23:04.312 --> 23:06.245
The teachers hated him,
the kids hated him.

23:06.313 --> 23:09.578
High school was an absolute nightmare.

23:11.084 --> 23:14.780
I was the most unpopular kid
in the high school.

23:14.854 --> 23:18.119
People were always picking on me
and beating me up.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.317
And the girls wouldn't
have anything to do with me.

23:21.393 --> 23:24.260
They treated me like I was
the scum of the earth.

23:24.329 --> 23:29.061
In this strip, I'm talking all about
my problems with women...

23:29.133 --> 23:32.591
starting with high school
where I learned a lot about women...

23:32.669 --> 23:35.398
because there was this guy
named Skutch, this guy here...

23:35.471 --> 23:39.669
who was like this mean bully...

23:39.742 --> 23:42.005
but he was also very charming.

23:42.077 --> 23:45.911
All the girls liked him.
He was the dreamboat...

23:45.981 --> 23:48.074
but he was also a bully.

23:48.150 --> 23:53.815
My brother Charles was one of the guys
he singled out for particular attention.

23:53.888 --> 23:59.154
He had this gang of flunkies
that hung around with him, with Skutch.

23:59.225 --> 24:01.523
So I remember this scene...

24:01.594 --> 24:05.825
where Skutch punches out my brother
in the hallway at school.

24:05.898 --> 24:09.697
It was a very sad sight
for me to see.

24:09.767 --> 24:12.964
Charles gave up trying to be popular
or have girlfriends...

24:13.037 --> 24:17.336
after everybody saw he couldn't fight
back, that he was beat up by Skutch.

24:17.407 --> 24:20.035
I've been living at home
since I graduated from high school.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.772
I made a few feeble attempts
along the way.

24:23.846 --> 24:28.749
You're no worse off than people that are
in the world and have to deal with it.

24:28.818 --> 24:33.754
But you got to take into consideration
that I'm taking tranquilizers.

24:33.822 --> 24:37.417
And that makes it a lot easier
than it would otherwise be...

24:37.492 --> 24:40.756
by taking these tranquilizers
and antidepressants.

24:40.828 --> 24:45.059
If it wasn't for them, I'd probably
go completely crazy living with Mother.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.725
I have to walk on eggs
when I'm around her.

24:49.802 --> 24:51.928
Yeah, you do.

24:52.003 --> 24:54.437
You can't tell my mother
the absolute truth.

24:54.506 --> 24:57.066
She's in a heavy state of denial
about a lot of things.

24:57.142 --> 24:59.871
I don't think
we should be talking about this.

24:59.944 --> 25:03.311
- Where's my kitty cats?
- About her mother, she's...

25:03.380 --> 25:06.473
What the hell's going on?

25:06.549 --> 25:11.714
She doesn't like you to talk about
her mother who was a complete monster.

25:11.788 --> 25:14.312
- What?
- Fix that thing in the hallway.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.880
- What thing?
- The window.

25:16.959 --> 25:18.893
What's wrong with it?

25:18.961 --> 25:23.659
- It's some film equipment or something.
- It's some kind of film equipment.

25:23.731 --> 25:26.928
- Where are my kitty cats?
- I don't know.

25:27.001 --> 25:31.733
Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be
out of here and back to normal.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.538
Here it shows these girls talking about
how one of their friends...

25:39.612 --> 25:43.547
got a date with Skutch
and how envious they all are.

25:43.615 --> 25:46.709
This is how I felt about it.

25:46.784 --> 25:49.616
I'm a little bitter about it,
as you can see.

25:49.686 --> 25:52.052
I show here how I thought
that most teenage boys...

25:52.122 --> 25:54.590
are very cruel and aggressive.

25:54.658 --> 25:58.855
And if girls could see that I was more
kind and sensitive, they would like me.

25:58.928 --> 26:01.692
They were kind of impressed
by the fact I could draw.

26:01.764 --> 26:06.097
I couldn't understand why they liked
these cruel, aggressive guys and not me.

26:06.167 --> 26:09.966
I was more kind and sensitive,
more like them.

26:10.037 --> 26:13.768
I didn't realize they didn't want you
to be like them, basically.

26:13.841 --> 26:16.673
I felt very hurt
and cruelly misunderstood...

26:16.743 --> 26:19.143
because I considered myself
talented and intelligent...

26:19.212 --> 26:22.238
and yet I was not
very attractive physically.

26:22.315 --> 26:26.011
I didn't think those things mattered.
It was what's inside that was important.

26:26.952 --> 26:31.888
When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be
a normal teenager, I was really a jerk.

26:31.956 --> 26:34.891
I tried to act
like I thought they were acting.

26:34.959 --> 26:40.021
It came out all wrong and weird,
so then I stopped completely...

26:40.096 --> 26:42.587
and became a shadow,
I wasn't even there.

26:42.666 --> 26:45.896
People weren't aware that I was...

26:45.968 --> 26:48.869
in the same world they were in.

26:48.938 --> 26:52.429
That freed me completely because
I wasn't under pressures to be normal.

26:52.507 --> 26:56.136
So I got interested in old-time music,
and went to the black section of town...

26:56.210 --> 26:59.235
knocking on doors
and looking for old records...

26:59.313 --> 27:01.577
and things like that
that would be unthinkable...

27:01.648 --> 27:04.014
if you were going to be
a normal teenager.

27:04.084 --> 27:08.520
Starting about 17, I started being
driven by that obsession that...

27:08.588 --> 27:12.990
‘‘I'll go down in history as
a great artist. That'll be my revenge.’’

27:13.058 --> 27:16.653
This is my image
celebrating Valentine's Day.

27:16.728 --> 27:19.629
‘‘February 13, 1962.

27:19.698 --> 27:23.098
I decided to reject conforming
when society rejected me.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.965
I've heard all about
that 'be yourself' stuff.

27:26.036 --> 27:28.697
When I'm myself,
people think I'm nuts.

27:28.771 --> 27:32.832
Guess I'll have to be satisfied
with cats and old records.

27:32.909 --> 27:35.638
Girls are just utterly
out of my reach.

27:35.711 --> 27:38.202
They won't even let me draw them.’’

27:40.849 --> 27:43.908
All that changed
after I got famous.

27:55.161 --> 27:57.458
Absolutely, I would love
to pose for you.

27:57.529 --> 27:58.962
Excellent.

27:59.031 --> 28:01.693
Anytime you want to come by and visit,
that'd be really nice.

28:01.767 --> 28:05.862
- Excellent.
- I always wanted to see you again.

28:16.512 --> 28:19.447
Some of the early ‘‘Weirdo’’ collages...

28:19.515 --> 28:22.143
and also some publications.

28:22.218 --> 28:24.208
We managed to track them down.

29:01.818 --> 29:03.251
I think Crumb...

29:03.319 --> 29:06.048
is basically the Brueghel
of the last half of the 20th century.

29:06.121 --> 29:09.716
There wasn't a Brueghel of the first
half, but there is of the last half.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.919
And that is Robert Crumb...

29:11.994 --> 29:16.760
because he gives you
that tremendous kind of impassion...

29:16.831 --> 29:21.096
of lusting, suffering,
crazed humanity...

29:21.168 --> 29:25.161
in all sorts of bizarre,
gargoyle-like allegorical forms.

29:25.238 --> 29:28.673
He's got this very powerful imagination,
which goes over the top a lot...

29:28.741 --> 29:30.675
but it very seldom lies.

29:30.743 --> 29:32.335
He's Mr. Natural.

29:32.411 --> 29:37.006
He accepts women
how they really are...

29:37.082 --> 29:39.380
and makes them even more beautiful
than they really...

29:39.451 --> 29:43.216
Like that woman.
I mean, she's really...

29:43.287 --> 29:46.745
She's got energy, form and drive.

29:46.824 --> 29:49.291
You can't push these women around.

29:49.358 --> 29:53.089
They're not wimps.
He gives power to women.

29:53.162 --> 29:56.358
He made it okay for me
to have a butt.

29:56.431 --> 30:00.800
He did a drawing of me,
which I really liked a lot. It was neat.

30:00.869 --> 30:05.032
It showed my thighs as they really are.
He helped me change my self-image.

30:05.106 --> 30:08.906
I had felt so inadequate before.
It was like I didn't know...

30:08.976 --> 30:11.705
Believe me, Stevayne,
you're adequate.

30:11.778 --> 30:13.712
Oh, you're so adequate.

30:14.948 --> 30:16.881
I feel Robert's work...

30:16.949 --> 30:22.285
is one of the most pertinent
social portraits...

30:22.354 --> 30:24.287
of an era...

30:24.355 --> 30:28.018
touching issues related to politics...

30:28.092 --> 30:31.549
to sex, to drugs, to religion...

30:33.196 --> 30:35.164
to the fine arts.

30:35.232 --> 30:39.759
And I would say Robert
is the Daumier of our time.

30:49.744 --> 30:52.075
He's a very remarkable artist, indeed.

30:52.146 --> 30:54.410
The tradition that I see him
belonging to is, essentially...

30:54.481 --> 30:59.213
the one of graphic art
as social protest, social criticism...

30:59.285 --> 31:01.810
which, of course,
has extremely long roots.

31:01.888 --> 31:05.585
There are elements of Goya in Crumb.
Goya's sense of monstrosity...

31:05.657 --> 31:10.321
comes out in those menacing bird-headed
women of Crumb's for instance.

31:11.563 --> 31:15.191
Robert! In front of all these people?

31:29.511 --> 31:32.071
The undergrounds are alive and well.

31:32.147 --> 31:35.013
Whole industry sprung up.
They're still reprinting the early ones.

31:35.082 --> 31:39.644
Number two, number four.

31:39.720 --> 31:43.450
God only knows how many of those
have been printed by now.

31:45.926 --> 31:48.723
‘‘Puke and Explode. '’

31:48.794 --> 31:51.490
It's called ‘‘Puke and Explode’’.

31:51.564 --> 31:55.932
That's new. Who put that out?
I don't know about these kids today.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.401
I guess you really started all this.
You created this whole thing.

31:59.470 --> 32:01.995
You're responsible.

32:02.072 --> 32:04.438
I don't like to take credit for that.

32:04.508 --> 32:07.568
Some of this stuff,
I know nobody would.

32:10.379 --> 32:12.313
I'm a really big fan of yours.

32:12.381 --> 32:16.010
I'm wondering if there's any chance
I can get an autograph from you.

32:16.085 --> 32:19.451
I don't think so.
I don't believe in giving autographs.

32:21.590 --> 32:24.581
Okay, well thanks anyway.

32:27.661 --> 32:31.926
- When are you actually moving?
- Couple months.

32:31.998 --> 32:34.558
France isn't perfect or anything.

32:34.634 --> 32:40.037
But it's slightly less evil
than the United States, I think.

32:40.105 --> 32:42.198
But that's not why I'm moving.

32:42.274 --> 32:45.367
Talk to my wife if you want to know
why I'm moving.

32:45.443 --> 32:48.469
We do have something here
that we wanted to show you.

32:48.546 --> 32:53.039
- Yeah?
- Yeah. 1967 rock concert poster.

32:53.116 --> 32:55.050
Extremely rare item.

32:55.118 --> 32:59.110
It’s my only rock concert poster
I ever did.

32:59.188 --> 33:02.680
There's this legend I keep hearing.
People telling me...

33:02.758 --> 33:06.921
‘‘Somebody told me you used to live with
the Grateful Dead in Haight Ashbury...

33:06.995 --> 33:10.692
and you hung around with Jerry Garcia. '’

33:10.765 --> 33:15.463
I never had anything to do
with those guys. I hated that music.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.766
I went to a couple of those
rock concerts and just fell asleep.

33:18.839 --> 33:21.363
Found it completely boring,
that psychedelic music.

33:23.643 --> 33:26.702
I've got something for you.
I want to tell you a little secret.

33:26.778 --> 33:30.145
It's called ‘‘Om Mani Padme Hum’’.

33:38.222 --> 33:43.284
This is where I get recognized more than
anyplace in the world, on Haight Street.

33:43.359 --> 33:46.886
- Amazing.
- I know. These are my people!

33:48.163 --> 33:50.097
People come to me and say,
‘‘R. Crumb!’’

33:50.165 --> 33:52.326
Sometimes some guy will sit with me...

33:52.401 --> 33:54.892
and chew my ear off
about all his hopes and dreams.

33:54.969 --> 33:58.905
Usually it's some broken-down
hippie-pest guy.

33:58.973 --> 34:03.500
It's never like a beautiful young
20-year-old girl.

34:04.577 --> 34:07.569
It's just so interesting
to come here and draw people.

34:07.647 --> 34:10.739
That's the main reason I come here,
just to watch people.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.016
That girl was sitting here one day.
Beautiful girl.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.784
I drew this other girl.
She came up and wanted the drawing.

34:20.858 --> 34:23.690
So I cut it out,
gave it to her.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.955
- Good way to meet girls.
- Right.

34:26.029 --> 34:28.862
I drew this girl.
She invited me to her house.

34:28.931 --> 34:31.024
Unfortunately, she wasn't
very attractive.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.000
You kept the picture, I see.

34:35.438 --> 34:39.168
It's ironic that you're
so identified with the '60s.

34:39.239 --> 34:44.109
At the time, it didn't seem you fit in
with that flower child thing.

34:44.179 --> 34:45.645
I tried!

34:45.713 --> 34:50.377
I used to come here every day
and try and be one of them.

34:50.451 --> 34:54.819
My main motivation was,
get some of that free love action.

34:54.887 --> 34:57.685
but I wasn't too good at it.

34:57.757 --> 34:59.724
People would ask,
‘‘Are you a narc?’’

34:59.791 --> 35:02.885
They would move away from you
at the love-in. I look like I do now.

35:02.961 --> 35:06.123
Exactly. You, in effect...

35:06.197 --> 35:10.133
- You did have a costume.
- It wasn't the right costume.

35:10.201 --> 35:12.930
I remember Janis Joplin giving me
this piece of advice.

35:13.003 --> 35:15.437
‘‘Crumb, what's the matter with you?
Don't you like girls?’’

35:15.505 --> 35:17.735
I said, ‘‘Of course I like girls.
What do you think?’’

35:17.807 --> 35:23.540
She said, ‘‘Just let your hair grow long,
get a satin, billowy shirt...

35:23.612 --> 35:26.842
velvet jackets and bell bottoms
and platform shoes.

35:26.914 --> 35:29.075
You'll do all right.’’

35:29.150 --> 35:31.846
I just couldn't do that.

35:31.919 --> 35:36.184
The whole thing was too silly to me.
I couldn't get with it.

35:37.457 --> 35:40.517
Here's a real beautiful one.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.189
I should get...

35:44.663 --> 35:47.427
The work in this book,
the art, the feelings...

35:47.500 --> 35:49.626
are what made me fall in love
with Robert.

35:49.701 --> 35:53.068
The way he saw colors
and the way he saw women.

35:53.138 --> 35:57.267
When I was 17 years old,
I looked a lot like that.

35:57.341 --> 35:59.571
So I was what he had been drawing.

35:59.643 --> 36:02.975
I was the embodiment of what
he had been drawing for years.

36:03.046 --> 36:06.641
It's such a sweet,
romantic vision of things.

36:06.716 --> 36:09.650
He did this book.
It took him, I think, a year.

36:09.718 --> 36:11.913
That was his life.

36:11.987 --> 36:14.888
He had just finished the book
days before we met.

36:14.956 --> 36:17.321
My parents were always fighting
all the time.

36:17.391 --> 36:19.359
I used to say,
‘‘I'm never getting married.’’

36:19.427 --> 36:24.261
My father said, ‘‘You'll marry the first
one that comes along.’’ He was right.

36:24.330 --> 36:28.664
Robert always had a sketchbook
or two going.

36:28.735 --> 36:30.998
He was constantly drawing.

36:31.070 --> 36:33.971
If we were in a restaurant,
he'd draw on the place mat.

36:34.039 --> 36:36.564
If we were on the bus,
he'd draw on his bus ticket.

36:38.342 --> 36:42.711
I had this big change
in 1965 and '66.

36:42.780 --> 36:46.078
It was visionary.

36:46.149 --> 36:48.913
Very powerful,
kind of knock-you-on-your-ass...

36:48.985 --> 36:52.112
visionary experience.

36:52.188 --> 36:55.851
This is my sketchbook for 1966
that covers that period.

36:55.925 --> 36:59.223
I took this very weird drug.

36:59.294 --> 37:03.492
Supposedly it was LSD,
but it had a really weird effect.

37:03.565 --> 37:06.328
It made my brain all fuzzy.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.561
This effect lasted
for a couple of months.

37:08.635 --> 37:11.968
I started getting these images,
cartoon characters like this...

37:12.039 --> 37:15.235
that I'd never drawn before
with these big shoes and everything.

37:15.308 --> 37:20.210
I let go of trying to have any coherent,
fixed idea about what I was doing.

37:20.278 --> 37:25.682
I started being able to draw these
stream-of-consciousness comic strips.

37:25.750 --> 37:29.776
Just kind of making up stuff.
It didn't have to make any sense.

37:29.854 --> 37:32.721
It could be stupid.
It didn't make any difference.

37:32.790 --> 37:36.225
All the characters that I used
for the next several years...

37:36.292 --> 37:38.988
came to me during this period.

37:39.062 --> 37:41.495
These fit into this vision I was having.

37:41.563 --> 37:47.058
It was a revelation of some seamy side
of America's subconscious.

37:47.136 --> 37:51.003
When I was drawing this,
there was this young girl. She was 11.

37:51.072 --> 37:53.006
She said, ‘‘Isn't that cute?’’

37:53.074 --> 37:57.533
To me, it was like a horror show,
this whole thing.

37:57.611 --> 38:00.307
And she thought it was really cute
and happy looking.

38:00.380 --> 38:04.611
To me, it was like a drawing
of the horror of America.

38:49.756 --> 38:53.782
There were these hippie underground
papers starting up in '66, '67.

38:53.859 --> 38:55.793
Every town had one or two of them.

38:55.861 --> 38:59.421
They would print anything if it was
related to the psychedelic experience...

38:59.497 --> 39:01.556
or the hippie ethic.

39:01.632 --> 39:03.827
So I started submitting...

39:03.901 --> 39:07.199
these LSD-inspired comics
I had been doing...

39:07.270 --> 39:09.261
to these papers,
and they liked them.

39:09.339 --> 39:12.865
Then this guy came who suggested
I do a whole issue of his paper.

39:12.942 --> 39:16.776
It was called ‘‘Yarrowstalks’’.
I did that, and that went over big.

39:16.845 --> 39:21.076
He said, ‘‘Why don't you do psychedelic
comic books, and I'll publish them?’’

39:21.149 --> 39:25.984
So I set to work, and I did
two whole issues of ‘‘Zap Comix’’.

40:40.751 --> 40:43.515
Crumb was incredibly exciting
and incredibly hot.

40:44.787 --> 40:47.881
There were just a handful of us...

40:47.957 --> 40:50.687
doing this new form of comics.

40:50.760 --> 40:55.526
And what he was doing
was just more innovative...

40:55.597 --> 40:59.191
than what any of us
had even thought of.

41:01.535 --> 41:05.130
It was fun to be a part of that
and to see ‘‘Zap’’ suddenly everywhere.

41:05.204 --> 41:09.300
From this concept of Robert's, this
fantasy of doing his own comic book...

41:09.375 --> 41:11.309
with a glossy cover
and actually printed...

41:11.377 --> 41:15.472
to seeing it turning up in all the
windows on Haight Street, around town...

41:15.547 --> 41:17.674
hearing people talk about it...

41:17.749 --> 41:21.479
having the other artists show up
and wanting to be a part of it.

41:21.552 --> 41:26.182
It happened very quickly. It seems to me
it happened in a matter of weeks.

41:48.608 --> 41:54.012
Crumb gave the ownership of ‘‘Zap’’
to the artists. There was no editor.

41:54.081 --> 41:58.517
There was a certain point where
it seemed underground comics...

41:58.584 --> 42:01.314
could get into the big time...

42:01.387 --> 42:05.720
and Crumb always seemed reluctant
to push that sort of thing.

42:05.790 --> 42:10.158
They were offering him 100,000 bucks...

42:10.227 --> 42:12.457
just to start talking.

42:12.529 --> 42:15.157
Robert turned it down
in two seconds.

42:15.232 --> 42:18.689
Aline screamed in the background,
‘‘What are you doing? We need money.’’

42:18.768 --> 42:22.169
Forget it! I'm not going on
‘‘Saturday Night Live’’.

42:22.238 --> 42:25.138
The Rolling Stones wanted me to do
an album cover.

42:25.207 --> 42:27.937
A couple other deals like that.
I said ‘‘No.’’

42:28.009 --> 42:30.340
This is not something you see
every day in America...

42:30.411 --> 42:32.402
where selling out
is everybody's ambition.

42:32.480 --> 42:37.246
After about a year of recognition
and all the bullshit of fame...

42:37.317 --> 42:39.785
I just said, ‘‘Fuck it’’...

42:39.853 --> 42:43.619
and I started drawing the dark part
of myself again in the comics...

42:43.690 --> 42:45.714
which I'd always kept hidden before.

42:45.791 --> 42:49.192
I was used to what he had been doing...

42:49.261 --> 42:51.888
which was really quite sweet.

42:51.963 --> 42:54.056
Then he did this one that was...

42:54.132 --> 42:57.795
just incredibly hostile to women...

42:57.869 --> 43:00.200
very sexually hostile.

43:00.270 --> 43:05.901
I wasn't expecting it.
I was really shocked and taken aback.

43:05.975 --> 43:07.966
And just kind of like, whack!

43:08.043 --> 43:10.876
It's hard for me to believe...

43:10.946 --> 43:15.814
that he can't channel himself
into doing better work.

43:15.884 --> 43:20.786
I like a lot of his work. And I don't
miss the satirical aspect of it.

43:20.854 --> 43:24.415
Then I have a different reaction.

43:24.491 --> 43:27.459
Perhaps one of being really
turned off and disgusted.

43:27.527 --> 43:32.123
And you know this cartoon,
‘‘Joe Blow’’...

43:32.198 --> 43:35.894
is one that I thought about a lot
in that light.

43:35.967 --> 43:39.664
On the one hand,
it's a satire of a 1950s...

43:39.738 --> 43:41.967
the healthy facade
of the American family.

43:42.039 --> 43:46.237
It kind of exposes the sickness
under the surface.

43:47.410 --> 43:50.311
But at the same time you sense...

43:50.380 --> 43:54.146
that Crumb is getting off on it
himself in some other way.

43:54.217 --> 43:59.381
On another level,
it's a self-indulgent orgy in a fantasy.

43:59.455 --> 44:02.252
And the fantasy,
specifically, this story...

44:02.323 --> 44:04.917
is a story about a father...

44:04.992 --> 44:08.484
who commands his daughter
to give him a blow job.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.860
She does,
and they wind up having sex.

44:10.931 --> 44:14.992
And the little Leave-It-To-Beaver type
brother comes running in...

44:15.068 --> 44:17.592
and sees the father and his sister,
and he's shocked.

44:17.670 --> 44:19.604
He runs to the mother
to tell her.

44:19.672 --> 44:24.938
And Mom comes out of a closet wearing
a sort of S&M getup.

44:25.009 --> 44:27.807
And the little boy says, ‘‘Oh, cool.’’

44:27.879 --> 44:30.278
The next thing,
Mom and son are having sex.

44:30.347 --> 44:33.475
The whole cartoon ends
with the parents saying...

44:33.550 --> 44:37.349
‘‘Gee, we should spend more time
with the kids. '’ Very funny.

44:37.420 --> 44:42.187
So you read something like this...

44:42.258 --> 44:45.385
and I think that it has
gone over the line...

44:45.460 --> 44:50.056
from satire of a 1950s...

44:50.131 --> 44:54.464
hygienic family in denial...

44:54.535 --> 44:58.903
into something which
is just Crumb producing pornography.

44:58.972 --> 45:02.169
I think this theme in his work
is omnipresent.

45:02.242 --> 45:05.472
It's part of an arrested
juvenile vision.

45:05.544 --> 45:10.538
Crumb's material comes out of a deep
sense of the absurdity of human life.

45:10.616 --> 45:14.915
At a certain psychic level, there aren't
any heroes, villains or heroines.

45:14.986 --> 45:17.318
Even the victims are comic.

45:19.523 --> 45:22.492
It's this which people in America
find rather hard to take...

45:22.559 --> 45:25.790
because it conflicts
with their basic feelings.

45:25.862 --> 45:30.298
That sort of mixture of utopianism on
one hand and Puritanism on the other...

45:30.366 --> 45:32.834
which is only another kind
of utopianism...

45:32.902 --> 45:38.100
which has given us the kind
of messy discourse that we have today.

45:38.172 --> 45:41.800
So Crumb, like all great satirists,
is an outsider in his own country.

49:00.245 --> 49:05.375
Jesus! The fucking
raging epithet music...

49:05.450 --> 49:10.046
coming out of every car, every store,
every person's head.

49:13.557 --> 49:16.549
If they don't have noisy radios,
they got earphones on like...

49:16.626 --> 49:19.423
‘‘Motherfuckin' cock suckin'
son of a bitch.’’

49:19.495 --> 49:23.989
That's a lot of aggression.
A lot of anger, a lot of rage.

49:24.066 --> 49:27.034
Everybody's walking advertisements.

49:27.102 --> 49:30.367
They've got advertisements
on their clothes.

49:30.438 --> 49:33.929
Go walking around with ‘‘Adidas’’
written across their chests...

49:34.007 --> 49:36.100
or ‘‘49ers’’ on their hats.

49:36.176 --> 49:39.373
Jesus. It's pathetic.
It's pitiful.

49:39.446 --> 49:41.970
The whole culture's one unified field...

49:42.048 --> 49:45.643
of bought, sold,
market-researched everything.

49:45.718 --> 49:48.481
It used to be people fermented
their own culture.

49:48.553 --> 49:52.387
It took hundreds of years,
and it evolved over time.

49:52.457 --> 49:55.687
That's gone in America.

49:55.760 --> 50:00.129
People now don't even have
any concept that there ever was...

50:00.197 --> 50:03.495
a culture outside of this thing
that's created to make money.

50:03.566 --> 50:07.093
Whatever's the biggest, latest thing,
they're into it.

50:07.170 --> 50:10.661
You just get disgusted after a while
with humanity...

50:10.739 --> 50:13.105
for not having more,
kind of like...

50:13.175 --> 50:18.976
intellectual curiosity about
what's behind all this jive bullshit.

50:38.429 --> 50:41.023
Charles and I talk
quite a bit about things.

50:41.099 --> 50:43.589
- We don't talk that much.
- Yeah, we do.

50:43.667 --> 50:46.397
We hold aloof from each other
for the most part.

50:46.470 --> 50:49.132
You spend all your time
watching television...

50:49.206 --> 50:52.174
and doing your crossword puzzles.

50:52.241 --> 50:57.440
I don't watch television. I turn it on
because it puts me to sleep.

50:59.981 --> 51:02.347
It's a good way to get to sleep.

51:02.417 --> 51:05.214
We're two recluses
living in the same house.

51:05.286 --> 51:07.254
I wake up at 3:00 a.m.
and it's still on.

51:07.321 --> 51:10.757
You do most of the talking
in the relationship, Mother.

51:10.825 --> 51:12.815
There's no doubt about that.

51:12.892 --> 51:17.829
You told me that even though you take
medication, you still feel depressed.

51:17.897 --> 51:23.061
Yeah, but not as much as I would
if I wasn't taking the medication.

51:23.135 --> 51:26.228
What would happen
if you stopped taking that stuff?

51:26.304 --> 51:29.137
I don't know.
I tried it a couple of times...

51:29.207 --> 51:32.005
and I didn't like what was starting
to happen to me.

51:32.076 --> 51:36.535
- He gets insomnia.
- I felt I was becoming unhinged.

51:36.613 --> 51:39.707
So I got back on them in a big hurry.

51:41.550 --> 51:44.041
I tried this a couple of times,
about two or three times.

51:44.119 --> 51:46.610
Do you still think
they're picking my brain, Mother?

51:46.689 --> 51:48.121
Yeah.

51:53.695 --> 51:56.492
You have nothing to hide,
nothing to be ashamed of.

51:56.563 --> 51:58.724
He's a good person.

51:58.799 --> 52:03.201
People like Charles.
You know.

52:03.269 --> 52:06.136
Some people like me
and some don't.

52:07.039 --> 52:10.007
I'm a very quiet,
well-behaved citizen.

52:10.075 --> 52:13.943
- I've gone from one extreme to another.
- You've gone in a complete circle.

52:14.012 --> 52:15.945
You used to make trouble
on the streets.

52:16.013 --> 52:19.039
One of the last times I went out
with you, we were walking around...

52:19.116 --> 52:22.448
and you went up to some old lady
on the street...

52:22.518 --> 52:25.453
and started drilling her
about her spiritual life...

52:25.521 --> 52:29.013
and she got frightened
and threatened to call the police.

52:29.092 --> 52:33.824
Charles goes up to these strangers
on the streets, starts raving at them.

52:33.896 --> 52:35.887
He was just a kid having fun.

52:35.964 --> 52:40.297
- This was when he was about 30.
- No, he wasn't!

52:40.368 --> 52:42.836
He's still doing that kind of stuff.

52:42.904 --> 52:47.465
Now he doesn't leave the house.
He got in trouble whenever he went out.

52:47.540 --> 52:51.498
Will you give me one good reason
for leaving the house?

52:51.577 --> 52:55.775
At least he's not out
taking illegal drugs.

52:55.848 --> 52:58.839
- No, he's taking legal drugs.
- I'm taking legal dope.

52:58.917 --> 53:01.977
Or being married and making
some woman miserable.

53:02.053 --> 53:03.987
This is true.

53:04.055 --> 53:08.184
One thing that kind of...
I spent all this money.

53:08.258 --> 53:12.853
And he's got these $200 teeth upstairs
and he won't wear them.

53:12.929 --> 53:16.092
- They're too uncomfortable.
- At first.

53:16.165 --> 53:19.691
You gotta leave them in there.
Then you don't know they're there.

53:19.768 --> 53:22.236
I never go anywhere, see anybody.

53:22.304 --> 53:25.239
What does he need them for?
To chew food or what?

53:25.307 --> 53:27.240
Pride in his own appearance.

53:27.308 --> 53:29.936
He never goes out.
What does he care what he looks like?

53:30.010 --> 53:33.035
I take a bath about once
in six weeks.

53:33.112 --> 53:36.513
I believe in having
a certain pride in yourself.

53:36.582 --> 53:41.609
In a way not that your ego gets out
of hand and you're an egomaniac...

53:41.687 --> 53:45.179
Pride can't exist
except in relation to other people.

53:45.257 --> 53:47.349
Yeah. That's right.

53:51.095 --> 53:55.030
I don't know. Your hygiene habits
are pretty good.

53:57.500 --> 54:02.232
I'm never constipated.
That's about all I can say for myself.
