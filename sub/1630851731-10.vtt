WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:05.504
- To our friend, trudy.

00:05.506 --> 00:09.574
Congrats on your full-time job
at webley's insurance.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.510
- As chief in-house
investigator.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.245
- We're wishing you
all the success.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.447
- And expecting a steep
family and friends discount

00:15.483 --> 00:17.416
On the double.
(laughing)

00:17.485 --> 00:19.451
- Thank you, ladies.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.253
- A reason to drink champagne
before dinner? We should be

00:21.322 --> 00:23.622
Thanking you.
- This is like the end

00:23.691 --> 00:25.657
Of an era.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.526
I think I need a tissue.
- No!

00:27.528 --> 00:30.328
None of that. Now is
the time to be celebrating!

00:30.364 --> 00:33.065
And drinks are
on my former partner.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.068
- We should go!
- Ok.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.405
- You know, I am happy for you.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.541
I just wish you would have
given me the opportunity

00:42.610 --> 00:45.143
To counter shep's offer.
- He wanted an answer

00:45.279 --> 00:48.080
On the spot.
Plus, you're leaving too.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.282
- Only for three months.
And it's for sandro's career,

00:50.284 --> 00:51.216
Not mine.
- Right.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.519
So european race circuit for him

00:53.521 --> 00:55.487
And five-star hotels for you?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.355
- Is that a yes or a no
to postcards?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.225
(laughing)

01:00.227 --> 01:02.628
- Hey, ladies. Sis.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.562
Uh, am I interrupting something?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.832
- Oh, no! We always have room
for one more at the table,

01:06.834 --> 01:09.368
Especially a drake.
Especially a handsome drake.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.303
- Maybe we'll just
leave this here?

01:11.372 --> 01:13.872
- Ladies, we should
let them catch up.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.841
Frankie, we'll
see you at jelly's.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.509
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.344
(frankie sighs)
- have fun!

01:20.514 --> 01:21.446
You done with this?

01:21.449 --> 01:23.315
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.251
- Jack, what are you doing here?

01:26.386 --> 01:28.253
- I've been practising
how to tell you this

01:28.322 --> 01:31.657
The whole ride from ottawa.
- Tell me what? What is it?

01:31.659 --> 01:34.827
What is it? I'm getting worried.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.197
- Ok.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.932
Maybe it's better
if I just show you.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.004
- "squishy's 30th anniversary."

01:46.006 --> 01:47.272
God! I haven't been there
since I was a kid.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.007
- Forget the trip
down memory lane.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.410
Frankie, that's dad!

01:51.545 --> 01:52.945
He's alive.

01:52.947 --> 01:57.282
(tense music)

01:57.417 --> 01:59.784
(theme music)

01:59.820 --> 02:02.421
(woman scat singing)

02:22.409 --> 02:24.376
- I'm telling you, frankie.
That's dad! Look.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.645
You got the nose. Those eyes.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.047
Those are drake eyes.
- Jack, there's no way.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.916
I--I saw him die. I was there

02:31.051 --> 02:32.884
When it happened.
- Well, you were a kid.

02:32.887 --> 02:34.319
- It doesn't mean
it didn't happen!

02:34.454 --> 02:36.522
- Ok. Well, maybe it wasn't dad
that you saw?

02:37.525 --> 02:39.991
- Look, I'm not saying
it is him.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.595
But, if it were...
Then we need to find him.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.064
- Well, that is
why I'm here, detective.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.399
Where do we start?

02:48.669 --> 02:51.003
- There was a kid in the alley
the night dad died

02:51.138 --> 02:53.271
Who saw everything,
rami mabrook.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.875
He's toronto's carpet king now.
We should start with him.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.945
- Frankie! Are you sure

03:00.014 --> 03:02.480
That it's ok to store jolina
here while we are away?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.949
- Um.
- Who is this?

03:04.084 --> 03:05.450
- Sandro, this is jack.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.720
Jack, sandro.
- Sandro.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.356
- Brother. Boyfriend.
- Ah! Brother?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.091
- Oh, of course,
she doesn't talk about me.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.193
- Ah.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.363
- Jack thinks that our father
might still be alive.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.832
I have to postpone our trip.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.968
- You will miss coppa acerbo.

03:23.103 --> 03:26.171
I'll be handing the victory
over to ferrari.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.973
- If it's true,
I have to at least try.

03:27.975 --> 03:31.176
- No, no, no. Don't just try.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.512
Find him, frankie.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.914
(rhythmic jazz music)

03:36.951 --> 03:39.517
(streetcar bell ringing)
-<i> and this...</i>

03:39.519 --> 03:42.321
...This right here is your desk.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.857
- What's this?
- That would be

03:45.859 --> 03:48.327
Your signing bonus.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.463
- Oh! I've never seen
my name next to a number

03:52.499 --> 03:55.334
Like this on a cheque before.
- I like to show my team

03:55.469 --> 03:57.803
Hearty appreciation
in hard dollars.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.339
- Well, then I can't wait
until the christmas bonus.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.240
(laughing)
- well, it sounds

04:02.243 --> 04:05.777
Like a party in here.
- Annabelle, come meet our new

04:05.912 --> 04:07.479
Chief in-house investigator,
ms. Clarke.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.947
- A pleasure, ms. Clarke.
I'm the in-house doctor.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.216
- Annabelle handles all

04:11.351 --> 04:12.751
Of webley insurance's
medical claims,

04:12.753 --> 04:15.487
Physical assessments, the like.
- I'm sure nothing

04:15.489 --> 04:17.723
As exciting as what you see
on any given day.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.757
- Oh, well, it depends
on the day. Some cases are

04:19.793 --> 04:21.559
As boring as a nun
on her honeymoon.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.029
- Oh! Oh-ho.
(laughing)

04:24.098 --> 04:27.199
- I like her.
(laughing)

04:27.201 --> 04:30.335
(phone ringing)
(indistinct chatter)

04:33.974 --> 04:36.241
- Oh, chin up!
Chin up, sticky fingers.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.909
(man laughs)

04:38.045 --> 04:39.511
Here. You're doing
important work,

04:39.513 --> 04:42.347
Clearing away
this commie propaganda.

04:42.349 --> 04:45.284
What if I told you
that you could leave this...

04:46.320 --> 04:48.653
...Behind you?
- What?

04:48.788 --> 04:51.156
Are they closing the department?

04:51.225 --> 04:52.924
No! After all this time?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.992
- No, no, no, shaw. No.
Lyle and I are going upstairs

04:55.029 --> 04:57.329
To talk to the chief today.
It's about time

04:57.331 --> 04:59.330
You were made a proper officer.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.199
- Really?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.767
Oh.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.003
After everything
that happened with mcintosh,

05:05.072 --> 05:07.472
I didn't think lyle was
a fan of mine.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.474
- Ah, lyle. He's just--
he's a bit intense.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.043
And he did get caught out
making a mistake, so...

05:12.046 --> 05:14.346
- I don't think he trusts me.
- He doesn't trust

05:14.415 --> 05:17.749
Anyone completely.
But we are on your side.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.151
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.485
- I don't know what to say.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.019
- Don't say anything.
You've earned it.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.089
- Hey, shaw. Ready to make
the move upstairs?

05:24.224 --> 05:26.524
- If you'll have me.
- I found him.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.626
- Where?
- Niagara falls.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.829
- That's where he is?
- Um...

05:30.831 --> 05:33.699
Well, thank you again!
- Yes! No problem.

05:37.704 --> 05:41.105
- I have a gorgeous
tajikistan rug

05:41.141 --> 05:43.175
That would do wonders in there.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.044
They don't call me
the carpet king for nothing.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.848
- We asked you here to talk
less about your line of work--

05:49.983 --> 05:51.950
- More about how you witnessed
our father's death.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.387
- A--a time in my life
I--I don't care to revisit.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.958
- I'll take the tajikistan
and whatever you have in mauve.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.862
- I was passing
through the alley.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.431
Always uneasy when you're alone.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.199
- What about your friend?

06:08.334 --> 06:10.402
- I wasn't with friends.
- I...

06:10.404 --> 06:13.405
I wrote down everything I heard
the police say that night.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.874
They reported two witnesses:

06:15.943 --> 06:18.009
You and gabe irons.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.745
- Right. Him.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.814
Yes. Ah, gabe was with me.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.283
- So, which is it? You were
alone, or you were with gabe?

06:25.285 --> 06:27.518
Are you lying to me now,

06:27.554 --> 06:29.755
Or did you lie
to the police back then?

06:31.291 --> 06:34.292
- Hey, come on, man.
We're the dead man's kids.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.628
We've been waiting for the truth
for a long time.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.765
- I only met gabe that day.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.767
Your father told us
to act like friends.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.202
I forgot he was
part of the ruse.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.172
- What do you mean "ruse"?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.241
- It was a sham.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.311
Your old man paid us
to help him fake his own death.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.380
(tense jazz music)

06:58.852 --> 07:01.586
- Thank you
for the school supplies.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.922
- No niece of mine's going
to fall behind on her education.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.990
- Life is heaven, isn't it?
(flo chuckles)

07:06.026 --> 07:07.725
- If by heaven you mean
listening to you talk

07:07.795 --> 07:09.895
On the phone all night
and endless laundry, sure.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.098
Els, by now you know
when I'm joking, right?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.667
Ellie! Ellie!

07:16.703 --> 07:19.570
- Her name is elsbeth...

07:19.606 --> 07:21.806
Florence.
- Roz.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.108
You're here. In toronto.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.943
- What did you say to her
to make my elsbeth run off?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.612
- I think it was
less about what she heard

07:27.747 --> 07:29.748
And more about who she saw.
- Don't be foolish.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.349
All daughters love
their mothers.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.287
- Have you blocked out our
entire childhood? And ellie's?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.021
- Don't insult
our family in public.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.891
- Don't pick a fight as soon
as you get here. She's not

07:39.927 --> 07:42.026
Going back with you, if that's
why you came to toronto.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.362
- It's none of your business.

07:44.398 --> 07:47.298
- When you kicked her out,

07:47.367 --> 07:49.300
Ellie's welfare became
my business.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.971
- She'll only get up to no good
in this godforsaken city of sin.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.374
Is that how you style
your hair now, florence? Ha.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.776
No wonder you're single.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.045
- You should get
on the next train.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.515
Ellie's staying put.
- Legally, you have no say.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.917
She's mine,
and I'm taking her home.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.157
- Morning person or night owl?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.726
- Night owl, except on sundays.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.661
(laughing)
coffee or tea?

08:16.796 --> 08:19.531
- My mother would roll over
in her good english grave...

08:19.533 --> 08:21.399
(with english accent):
...If I didn't answer tea.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.401
(laughing)
- excuse me.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.871
I'm looking for a mr. Webley.
That cheat denied

08:26.874 --> 08:28.340
My claim!
- Do you want to take a seat?

08:28.475 --> 08:30.208
- I want the money
that's owed to me.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.343
- I'm sure we could
sort this out.

08:32.478 --> 08:36.080
What's your name?
- Sintra. Sintra patel.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.516
- Grab her file?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.352
What happened?

08:40.487 --> 08:43.555
- I broke my leg
falling off a ladder.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.190
The hospital gave me a bill,

08:45.325 --> 08:47.024
Said the insurer won't pay.
- Ah!

08:47.060 --> 08:49.894
I see the misunderstanding now.
Your chart says you suffer

08:49.930 --> 08:51.563
From an underlying condition.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.499
Any accidents related to that
would not be covered.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.135
- What condition?
- Low blood pressure. See?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.903
I would have done
your assessment myself.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.172
- But I don't have
low blood pressure.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.008
- Oh, but it's all here,
in print.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.844
I'm sorry.
But you shouldn't have been

09:05.979 --> 09:08.913
Up on that ladder.
- It's not a choice.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.716
I have to work.
Unlike you webley folk,

09:11.851 --> 09:13.618
Who are choosing to be crooked.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.857
- Unfortunately,
not the first client hoping

09:18.992 --> 09:20.458
For an easy policy payout.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.860
- Does her file mention
a family?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.195
- Oh, yes.
She has four children.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.631
- It's unlikely a mother
of four would risk injury

09:26.633 --> 09:30.067
Or death just for a payout.
- Oh, trudy!

09:30.103 --> 09:33.204
We're going to have to toughen
that soft heart of yours.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.940
(tense jazz music)

09:37.744 --> 09:40.078
- So you've been quiet.
You mad?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.614
- No, I'm not mad.
I just don't understand

09:42.616 --> 09:45.883
Why he would lie to us.
He abandoned us.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.286
- I don't really feel abandoned.
And, to be honest, I don't think

09:48.421 --> 09:50.488
The first thing we do when we
see him is interrogate him.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.157
- Why did you ask for my help
if you don't want any answers?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.759
(keys jingling)

09:54.894 --> 09:56.628
- I want my son
to meet his grandpa.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.000
I am offended by how surprised
you look right now.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.436
Hugh drake, or hughie balooey
as my wife

10:05.505 --> 10:09.374
And I like to call him--
- your wife? The plot thickens.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.642
So what? Aunt frankie is
just chopped liver?

10:11.678 --> 10:13.712
- No, of course, I wanted
you to meet him!

10:13.847 --> 10:17.048
Them. I was, ah,
I was waiting 'til christmas.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.349
- Ok. Well, I'm going
to hold you to that.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.451
- Yeah, us drakes
haven't been too hot

10:20.520 --> 10:23.722
In the family department.
I feel really lucky.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.322
(vehicle honks)

10:25.359 --> 10:27.325
- Hopefully, that luck
doesn't change.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.130
- You know,
for a guy named squishy,

10:32.265 --> 10:34.299
He hasn't done
so bad for himself.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.835
- First lift?
- A candy bar

10:37.904 --> 10:39.704
Or two may have made their way

10:39.706 --> 10:41.339
Into my pocket.
- Ah!

10:41.341 --> 10:44.943
Young blood. Tobacky?
- No, thank you.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.611
But congrats
on 30 years in business.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.013
- Oh, it's actually
only 28 or so.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.449
I just felt like having
a little party.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.286
- This man celebrate with you?
- Sure did.

10:55.421 --> 10:59.357
Good ol' ned. Used to come
in here a lot 15 years ago.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.092
Bought cartons for his brothers.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.962
Mother must have had a litter.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.030
- Brothers? Dad didn't have
any brothers.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.633
- Did you two catch up?
- Not really.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.903
Yeah. I turned
to help a customer,

11:11.905 --> 11:14.072
And ned was in an awful hurry.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.877
- Carolina crowns.
- Yeah, he asked me

11:18.879 --> 11:22.380
To bring a carton by where he's
staying, the bluebell hotel.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.851
- Thanks, squishy.
That's what I owe you.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.920
(rhythmic jazz music)

11:32.125 --> 11:33.425
- Excuse me.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.598
Steven! Steven, guess what?
I have some good news.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.268
- I do too! Albert steward has
agreed to go on the record.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.403
- Oh, th--that's wonderful.
Sorry, who's albert again?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.339
- Remember when we met?
I told you hunter and lyle

11:48.408 --> 11:50.341
Roughed up a man.
His police file disappeared

11:50.377 --> 11:52.277
As fast as he did.
- Right. Flo's hospital

11:52.412 --> 11:53.945
Treated him.
- Yes, and his injuries

11:53.947 --> 11:56.313
Weren't the worst of them.
Turns out lyle's been beating

11:56.349 --> 11:58.483
False confessions out
of suspects for years.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.018
- And albert has proof of this?
- Yes. That's why

12:01.054 --> 12:02.954
He's got a target on his back.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.290
So he's fighting back
by going on the record

12:05.292 --> 12:07.291
In my exposé.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.160
Mwah!

12:09.295 --> 12:12.764
- Steven! I've--I've never
seen you this excited.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.232
- You know how long
this article's consumed me.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.102
Now, I can finally get to print
and take down those poor excuses

12:17.237 --> 12:18.970
For detectives. Hey, come with.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.372
- Where?
- Niagara falls.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.776
Albert steward and I have set up
a meeting spot to talk.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.679
- Ooh. Oh, dear.
- What's wrong?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.648
- It's just... I overheard

12:30.650 --> 12:32.851
Detective lyle talking
to detective hunter

12:32.853 --> 12:34.519
About finding someone
in niagara falls.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.421
- I see.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.924
- Wh--what are you doing?
- What do you think?

12:40.059 --> 12:41.992
- I'm coming with you!

12:42.028 --> 12:44.261
(car creaks)

12:44.297 --> 12:46.264
We just have to stop
at my house first.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.666
And don't tell my mother!

12:48.668 --> 12:51.903
(relaxed jazz music)

12:54.174 --> 12:57.408
- Ok. Front desk says
this is his room.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.076
- I think I can
hear him in there.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.945
(jack exhales sharply)
- you ready?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.481
- To meet my back-from-the-dead
father? I don't know

13:03.616 --> 13:05.283
How you're supposed
to be ready for that.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.356
(approaching footsteps)

13:11.358 --> 13:13.424
(nora gasps)
nora?!

13:13.559 --> 13:15.526
What are you doing here?
- What?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.362
You think your mother
doesn't read the paper?

13:17.364 --> 13:21.166
If ned's back in town,
it's for a job. And I want in.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.042
- The moment I saw that photo,
I knew it was ned.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.312
Oh, a woman never forgets
her ex-husband's mug.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.614
His birthday?
Sure, but not his face.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.716
- How'd you end up in his room?
- Had a little hunch

13:38.752 --> 13:41.986
I'd find him here,
the old bluebell hotel.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.589
It's where your dad
and I used to come to, um,

13:44.724 --> 13:46.991
Celebrate a grift gone well.
- All right.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.526
Spare us the details.
There's nothing in the drawers.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.462
There's no toothbrush
in the bathroom.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.399
- He always did travel light.
- You know, I oughta wring

13:54.534 --> 13:57.534
His neck for what he's done,
but... I'd be open

13:57.571 --> 14:00.738
To forgiveness if this job paid
the rent for a year.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.473
- That's all you think
about is money.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.742
- Oh,<i> pardonnez-moi,</i>
mister high-and-mighty.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.211
- Why are you even here?
You left my father. You have

14:07.280 --> 14:09.213
No right to even see him.
- Says the son

14:09.216 --> 14:11.883
He kept a secret!
- Ok, that's enough! No!

14:11.885 --> 14:13.117
Jack!

14:14.888 --> 14:16.553
(playful jazz music)

14:16.590 --> 14:17.555
- Good.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.760
Now that we're alone...

14:22.762 --> 14:25.162
(frankie sighs)
look--oh, I'll apologize to him

14:25.164 --> 14:27.899
After he cools down.
Look at this.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.101
That man? That's desmond greer.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.170
So, back in the day,
he and your dad used

14:32.172 --> 14:35.105
To run grifts together.
Big ones.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.709
- What? So, you think
they're back in business?

14:37.844 --> 14:40.378
- Both of them at the same place
at the same time?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.246
They're up to their old tricks.
- Why didn't you say

14:42.249 --> 14:44.315
Something earlier?
- Because of jack.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.185
Oh, baby. Your little brother
isn't on the level.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.120
- And you are?
- Ouch!

14:50.156 --> 14:52.256
- Ok, so, look, we need to talk

14:52.259 --> 14:54.525
To this desmond greer.
Where do I find him?

14:54.660 --> 14:56.728
- Well, "we" might be a problem.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.064
I might have broken up
his marriage. But you,

15:00.199 --> 15:02.667
Ned drake's own flesh and blood?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.202
You he will talk to.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.138
- Apologize to jack.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.273
I'll meet you
back at the office.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.209
♪♪

15:12.479 --> 15:14.012
(door closes)

15:14.147 --> 15:16.080
(upbeat jazz music)

15:16.215 --> 15:18.149
(engine rumbling)

15:24.257 --> 15:26.224
- There are plenty of reasons
why albert wasn't

15:26.226 --> 15:29.294
At the meeting spot.
- Sure. Are any reasons good?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.030
- Well, I am sure there is
a rational explanation.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.366
- I wish I had your optimism.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.635
- He could still be at a hotel,
or a lodging house.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.138
- My mind's going
in circles, mary.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.906
- Ok. Take a breath.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.508
- Yeah.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.310
(mary sighs)

15:46.445 --> 15:49.847
Hey, earlier you wanted to tell
me something. What was it?

15:49.849 --> 15:52.183
- Oh, th--that was nothing.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.984
It was just some work news.
It can wait.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.387
- I always wanna hear your work
news, especially if it had you

15:56.456 --> 15:59.223
As excited as oliver twist
getting a second helping.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.995
- Well, ah,
detective hunter told me

16:03.997 --> 16:06.263
That he and detective lyle
are going to speak

16:06.299 --> 16:08.733
With the chief about making me
a police officer.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.868
A real police officer.
- They are, huh?

16:10.870 --> 16:12.770
- I know
that neither one of them is

16:12.839 --> 16:15.073
Perfect but hunter, at least--
- he's as crooked as the day

16:15.075 --> 16:17.241
Is long, just like lyle.
But do you even want a promotion

16:17.277 --> 16:18.376
If that's you how get it?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.411
- I have been doing
excellent work, steven.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.179
- I--I--
- there is nothing wrong with

16:22.181 --> 16:24.648
A fellow officer putting in a
good word for me with the chief.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.084
- They're despicable, mary.
- Which is

16:26.219 --> 16:28.152
Why the force needs
more officers like me!

16:28.287 --> 16:29.686
(steven scoffs)
besides,

16:29.723 --> 16:32.490
It's your witness's word against
theirs and I'm sorry, steven,

16:32.625 --> 16:34.492
That's not solid proof.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.627
You believe in fairness,
don't you?

16:36.762 --> 16:38.596
(steven sighs)

16:40.500 --> 16:43.368
(sombre jazz music)

16:44.771 --> 16:46.304
(sighs)

16:47.440 --> 16:49.407
(indistinct chatter)

16:53.580 --> 16:55.312
- 100 over 70. Perfect.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.448
Like lemonade
on a hot summer's day.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.984
- And no one's ever told you
you have blood pressure issues?

17:00.119 --> 17:01.919
- No. Never.
- Do you ever have

17:01.921 --> 17:03.554
Any dizzy spells or feel faint?

17:04.590 --> 17:06.457
- Uh, four kids'll
turn you around,

17:06.493 --> 17:08.126
But, other than that, no.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.728
- All your blood work is normal.
Nothing that indicates

17:10.863 --> 17:12.663
Any problems that would keep
you from being insured.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.065
- Does that mean I can get
my insurance money after all?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.467
- I'm working on it.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.603
(sighs)
- thank you, miss clarke.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.539
Thank you, dr. Chakowitz.
- Doctor.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.875
(flo chuckles)
I like the sounds of that.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.311
- Thank you.
- Oh! And these candies will

17:27.446 --> 17:29.413
Keep your kids busy
for a few minutes. Here.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.949
In your pocket.
- Thank you.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.652
Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.690
- So what do you think?
- Honestly? I don't know.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.292
- What do you mean?
- Based on annabelle's

17:41.427 --> 17:43.961
Assessment, mrs. Patel is
a 90-year-old

17:44.030 --> 17:46.564
Opium addict with glaucoma
on her death bed.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.433
- You just said she was healthy.
- Exactly. She is.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.436
- So annabelle misdiagnosed her?
- It's more than that.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.071
This assessment looks like it

17:54.074 --> 17:55.906
Was written by someone
who learned about medicine

17:55.942 --> 17:56.974
From a radio play.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.711
I don't think
annabelle's a real doctor.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.315
-<i> I don't believe it.</i>

18:04.317 --> 18:06.116
Ned's alive.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.585
- You sound surprised,
mr. Greer.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.922
I thought maybe you two were
planning some big job together.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.658
(mr. Greer scoffs)
or maybe helping him

18:13.793 --> 18:16.460
Fake his death was
the last con that you pulled?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.430
- What? No! Ned's death
spooked me into going straight.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.165
- Are you sure you haven't
spoken to him since?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.600
- Not a word.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.735
Listen, if you do find him,

18:24.804 --> 18:27.872
Please... Tell him
to come see me.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.274
(frankie sighs)
- will do.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.143
That's an interesting ring.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.412
- Ah, thank you. It was a,
uh, gift from a brother.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.015
Ah, which just reminds me,
I'm supposed to see him tonight.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.950
So... If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.520
(intriguing jazz music)

18:44.257 --> 18:47.091
- Again, so sorry about
the mix-up, mrs. Tenenbaum.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.895
Maybe consider a closed casket?
- Aunt flo?

18:51.030 --> 18:53.097
Aunt flo.
- Ellie. Are you ok?

18:53.232 --> 18:55.499
- No. Mother left a note
under your door.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.169
She said she's filing papers
for a hearing at juvenile court.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.037
I mean, why?
- Oh.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.906
Maybe she's claiming
I kidnapped you

19:01.908 --> 19:03.841
Or you burned down
the family barn. The world is

19:03.976 --> 19:07.110
Her bad oyster.
- You have to stop her.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.113
I mean, if she makes me go home,

19:09.182 --> 19:11.649
I'll just run away again.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.451
And I won't ever stop.

19:13.586 --> 19:18.256
(tense jazz music)

19:19.458 --> 19:22.326
- (sebastian): Frankie. Frankie!

19:22.461 --> 19:24.128
- Oh... Wh...

19:25.598 --> 19:27.865
Were you calling me?
- I was, and it seems

19:27.934 --> 19:29.734
Like I lost out to a shoe box.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.904
What has you so engrossed?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.340
- Just some things
that belonged to my dad.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.209
I--I haven't looked
at this stuff in ages.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.777
- You two were close?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.614
- After the last 24 hours,
I'm not so sure.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.483
- Yeah. Dads are tough.
I never really knew

19:46.519 --> 19:48.419
Where I stood with mine.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.954
Knew where he stood
with a drink, though.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.556
- Hm.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.227
(mysterious jazz music)

19:56.229 --> 19:58.262
My dad's friend had this exact

19:58.264 --> 20:00.631
Same ring.
I knew I recognized it.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.167
- Class ring maybe?
Um, schoolmates?

20:03.302 --> 20:05.836
- My dad wasn't one for school.
Wait, there's...

20:05.872 --> 20:07.705
There's something etched inside.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.941
Dagger, maybe?

20:12.645 --> 20:15.246
- This your old man?
- Can I see that?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.324
Oh.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.099
- Let me see that ring
you were looking at.
- Yeah.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.072
- You gotta be kidding me.
Your father was a brother

20:41.207 --> 20:42.940
Of the crooked dagger?
- A what?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.042
- The carpenter I apprenticed
under? He was a brother.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.879
They're a mix of high society
and common thieves.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.016
A lot of back-scratching,
fierce loyalty,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.084
Some bloodshed.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.819
- Secret society?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.889
Des said that he was
seeing his brothers.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.891
There's a meeting tonight.
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.159
Where're you going?

21:02.161 --> 21:04.061
- To find my dad.
- Frankie,

21:04.196 --> 21:06.597
These men are dangerous.
You can't just walk into

21:06.732 --> 21:08.165
A brotherhood meeting.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.001
- Watch me.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.637
(ominous music)

21:26.252 --> 21:28.185
- Brothers, we are

21:28.221 --> 21:29.920
Facing a problem.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.590
Our very existence is
under threat.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.460
Ned drake's daughter
visited me today

21:36.496 --> 21:40.064
With proof that he is
very much alive.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.266
(indistinct whispering)
now, I don't have to remind you

21:42.401 --> 21:45.002
That ned is no friend of ours.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.470
He knows our secrets,

21:46.472 --> 21:50.875
And if he's back,
it is to expose us or extort us.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.612
We must eliminate
this problem immediately.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.783
And with force if necessary.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.754
♪♪

22:05.958 --> 22:08.225
- What's wrong?
What did albert say?

22:08.294 --> 22:10.094
- I only spoke with the hotel
clerk who was cleaning out

22:10.096 --> 22:11.562
Albert's room.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.432
Albert died
in a car collision yesterday.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.301
- Oh, my.
Oh, steven, that's awful.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.904
- I'll give you one guess
how a cautious man dies

22:20.039 --> 22:21.905
In a crash just as he's
about to be interviewed

22:21.941 --> 22:23.774
On police corruption.
- Well, don't you think

22:23.776 --> 22:25.910
That's a bit overly suspicious?
- Mary, I'm simply connecting

22:26.045 --> 22:27.711
The dots.
Hunter and lyle did this.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.913
- Well, hold on.
We have no actual proof of that.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.049
- Why are you
defending monsters?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.051
- Because, steven,

22:34.186 --> 22:36.120
I have my convictions
the same as you,

22:36.255 --> 22:38.589
And I believe in due process.
(steven sniffs)

22:38.724 --> 22:41.925
(mary sighs)
- where are you going?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.194
- I am going to the niagara
police to find out

22:44.230 --> 22:46.263
Where this collision occurred.
- So you believe me?

22:46.332 --> 22:48.132
- I didn't say that.
(elevator bell dings)

22:49.668 --> 22:51.602
(ominous music)

22:57.276 --> 23:00.377
- Hey! Frankie drake! Hey!

23:00.446 --> 23:01.879
- One step closer
and I'll shoot.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.547
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Kid! Slow down.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.549
It's me.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.085
It's pops.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.364
- I don't understand.
- Look, look, I'll explain

23:20.499 --> 23:22.900
Everything to you later,
I promise you, but right now,

23:22.969 --> 23:24.968
Frankie, we've gotta go.
Let's go! Come on.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.104
Gotta get out of here.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.173
(engine rumbling)

23:29.242 --> 23:31.208
(owl hooting)

23:32.678 --> 23:34.011
- Over here!

23:38.985 --> 23:41.786
- Oh, my goodness.
- Car door.

23:43.356 --> 23:45.523
Look at these scratches here.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.194
Hunter and lyle ran him
off the road.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.430
- The report from the niagara
police didn't say anything about

23:52.565 --> 23:54.832
Another car being involved.
- 'course it didn't.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.602
- Where are you going?
- We need to get back

23:58.638 --> 24:01.338
If I'm going to get my article
filed for this week's edition.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.473
- But you don't have
a witness anymore.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.676
- Then I'll publish without one.
- Well, won't that hurt

24:05.811 --> 24:07.945
Your credibility?
- Not reporting this story

24:07.947 --> 24:09.813
When I know how corrupt
those two are will hurt it more.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.949
- So you're just gonna put your
career on the line like that?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.151
- Some things are
more important than a career.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.354
(pensive jazz music)

24:17.356 --> 24:18.622
(car door opens)

24:18.658 --> 24:20.891
- Private eye, huh?
It's not exactly the life

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
I'd imagined for you.
- A lot can change

24:22.962 --> 24:24.828
Over the years.
- Frankie, wait.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.963
- You abandoned me.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.167
I was a kid and you just left.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.236
- I know.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.971
And I'm sorry.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.972
But, hey, you've done
pretty well for yourself,

24:36.008 --> 24:38.309
Running a business.
- That's not the point.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.679
I needed a father,
and you were gone. Why?

24:43.149 --> 24:44.548
- I was a coward.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.384
- You were.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.153
(approaching footsteps)

24:49.155 --> 24:51.388
- Frankie!

24:55.094 --> 24:56.894
- I'll see you in there.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.197
- Was that him? Was that
your father? You found him!

25:01.234 --> 25:04.568
- I did. Um... It's, uh...

25:04.604 --> 25:06.370
- It's wonderful, bella!

25:06.505 --> 25:08.439
- It's complicated.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.810
He's in some trouble.
- Ah.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.145
I'm afraid I understand
where this is going.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.615
You're not coming with me.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.618
- I can't. Not yet.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.088
- Frankie, I--I cannot wait.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.023
- So what are you saying?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.691
(alessandro sighs)

25:30.463 --> 25:33.731
- Come when you can. If you can.

25:34.901 --> 25:38.135
- I will, as soon
as things settle down.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.305
- If there is one thing
that I have learned,<i> mia cara,</i>

25:41.374 --> 25:43.840
It's that things...

25:43.876 --> 25:45.776
Never settle down.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.444
(sentimental music)

25:53.118 --> 25:56.920
- An unexpected reunion?
Really? That's your line

25:56.956 --> 25:58.856
After 20 years?
- Oh.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.525
- I deserve to wring you neck
after you abandoned frankie

26:01.594 --> 26:03.526
Like you did!
- Oh, so says the woman

26:03.563 --> 26:05.529
Who took off while frankie was
still in diapers.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.531
- Well, that was
because you were shacked

26:07.533 --> 26:08.999
Up with a different hussy
every month!

26:09.134 --> 26:10.567
- Hey, hey, hey! That's
my mother you're talking about.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.002
- Listen...
- Ah, shut up.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.704
- I was as loyal as a labrador
'til you started

26:13.839 --> 26:15.339
Th--th--that fling
with j.P. Morgan!

26:15.474 --> 26:17.474
- How many times
do I have to tell you that was

26:17.543 --> 26:20.077
All part of the grift?!
- That's enough! You need

26:20.079 --> 26:21.979
To tell us
what the hell is going on!

26:22.048 --> 26:22.880
- Uh...

26:23.015 --> 26:25.482
For... Well, for me
to explain that,

26:25.618 --> 26:29.320
First I gotta tell you
why I had to die.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.623
- I don't understand
why you are so hell-bent

26:33.659 --> 26:35.492
On getting ellie
back under your roof

26:35.561 --> 26:37.027
When she is happy here.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.096
- Elsbeth requires
someone to help guide her

26:39.231 --> 26:41.231
As she becomes a woman.
- Couldn't agree more.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.900
- Then, surely,
you see my point.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.636
- Unless the point you're
talking about is at the end

26:45.771 --> 26:48.572
Of that french fry in your hand,
I really don't.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.641
- Then let me speak plainly.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.977
My daughter needs a positive
role model, not some new woman

26:54.013 --> 26:55.979
More focused on making money
than making a home.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.214
(chuckles)

26:58.217 --> 27:01.351
- Rosalyn, I love you.
I really do.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.320
But you're the single
most hypocritical person

27:03.389 --> 27:06.557
I have ever known.
Oh, you put on a good show

27:06.692 --> 27:08.992
With your church on Sunday
and your pious clothes.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.795
But I know who you really are.
- What are you talking about?

27:11.797 --> 27:13.997
- The drinking. The affairs.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.499
Would you really like

27:15.634 --> 27:17.601
To air that dirty laundry
in court?

27:17.736 --> 27:19.636
- You wouldn't dare.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.940
- It wouldn't give me one bit
of pleasure. But for ellie?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.009
In a heartbeat.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.945
(cheerful music playing)

27:29.615 --> 27:31.982
- Well, by then,
des was off the hook.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.085
But the only way I could get off
the cops' radar was to die.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.288
Look, I--I never
would have left you,

27:38.290 --> 27:40.557
Either of you,
if--if I'd had the choice.

27:40.559 --> 27:43.026
- We know that. Right, frankie?
- So why're you back?

27:43.029 --> 27:44.995
- Sir francis drake.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.297
Well, his telescope.
It was just stolen from a museum

27:47.299 --> 27:49.333
In quebec city.
- Oh, brother.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.601
Here we go with this again.
- Something like that must be

27:51.637 --> 27:53.870
Worth a ton. You stole it?
- No, no. That was des.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.039
Ah, but using plans
that I drew up

27:56.042 --> 27:57.908
When frankie was still a baby.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.043
I wanted to get you something
special for your first birthday.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.912
- Oh, how touching.
- So, what? You're going

28:01.914 --> 28:05.048
To steal a telescope from des
because he used your plans?

28:05.117 --> 28:07.384
- Yeah, that's right.
That's right. It's hidden

28:07.386 --> 28:09.453
In the brotherhood's vault.
I'm just going to go in

28:09.588 --> 28:10.987
And get it and that's it.
- That's it?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.190
You come back from the dead
to do a job and then, what?

28:13.259 --> 28:14.657
You're just going
to take off again?

28:14.694 --> 28:16.660
- That's the way
it's got to be, right?

28:16.795 --> 28:19.463
Be--between des and the cops--
- so how the hell are we
supposed to get

28:19.465 --> 28:21.197
Inside a locked vault
that's inside

28:21.233 --> 28:24.401
Some kind of secret society?
- I got a way in.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.004
But I gotta find
two more signet rings

28:27.006 --> 28:29.540
So I can unlock the chest.
- How do we get those?

28:29.675 --> 28:32.075
- You don't. I do.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.645
- Oh, no! Wait! You can't.

28:34.647 --> 28:36.880
It's too dangerous
for you out there.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.483
Besides, I was, um... Ahem...

28:40.586 --> 28:43.286
I was kind of hoping we could
do a little catching up.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.623
- Jack and I will go get the
rings. Just tell us where to go.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.692
- Oh, yeah?
- Tell them. Hm?

28:48.694 --> 28:51.561
- Uh, th-there's a shoeshine
place down by the bus station.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.363
(indistinct mumbling)

28:53.498 --> 28:55.198
(scoffs)

28:55.333 --> 28:57.034
- (frankie): Dad says
that he's got both rings.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.437
- Ah, maybe you should just do
this one on your own, frankie.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.906
- You create a distraction,
I'll grab the rings

29:02.975 --> 29:04.107
And I'll meet you
back at the office.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.176
(jack sighs)
- I don't know about this.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.711
- Has domestic life
made you soft?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.446
- Maybe a bit.
But it's worth it.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.449
- If you say so.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.452
I'm happy for you, ok?
- But?

29:15.454 --> 29:17.254
- Oh!
- But I can't imagine

29:17.256 --> 29:18.856
That kind of life for myself.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.591
Here we go.
(metallic clinking)

29:21.726 --> 29:23.494
(man sighs)

29:24.463 --> 29:25.762
Hello there.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.198
- How can I help you, miss?
- I can't resist a shoeshine

29:28.333 --> 29:29.566
From a handsome fellow.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.469
- Well, by the time
I get the grime off

29:32.604 --> 29:34.404
These shoes,
we should be old pals.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.540
(laughing)
let's see.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.109
Oh... Kay.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.478
(suspenseful music)

29:42.948 --> 29:44.614
- Sir! That man just walked off

29:44.650 --> 29:47.918
With your cash box.
- Ah! Not this again! Hey!

29:49.988 --> 29:52.289
(police whistle sounds)
- (man): Stop! Police!

29:57.362 --> 29:58.595
- Bingo.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.905
(sighs)

30:08.907 --> 30:11.007
- Thank you.
- No problem.

30:11.009 --> 30:14.010
You know what?
I'm, uh, running short on time.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.578
Next time.
- Oh! Oh.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.981
Thank you.
- Thanks.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.016
(indistinct chatter)
(keyboards clacking)

30:20.018 --> 30:23.220
(phone rings)
- toronto pd switchboard.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.393
- Shaw! Hey.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.527
I got some really good news
about that thing

30:31.564 --> 30:33.063
Lyle and I talked
to the chief about.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.298
- Oh...

30:35.133 --> 30:36.033
- Let's talk.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.836
There's the man!
After you, mary.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.805
(ominous music)

30:44.009 --> 30:46.143
- This is a funny spot
to get good news.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.077
- You could be
a great cop, shaw.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.213
- Real great. Top of the line.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.315
But...

30:51.450 --> 30:53.617
- Your commie boyfriend's
a problem.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.419
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't play the innocent.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.154
We've seen you two
all over town.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.489
And we know about
the article he's writing.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.191
- Guy's got a vendetta
against cops.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.960
- Being associated
with a guy like that

31:03.095 --> 31:05.996
Doesn't reflect well on someone
in line for a promotion.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.966
- What are you saying,
detectives?

31:09.101 --> 31:10.634
- Just that we all make choices.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.936
- And actions have consequences.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.373
- I don't care for threats
and neither does steven.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.507
- Oh, we're not
threatening, mary.

31:17.642 --> 31:18.809
- Just giving you the facts

31:18.811 --> 31:21.411
So you can make
an informed choice.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.717
- Excu--excuse me, please...

31:26.852 --> 31:28.785
Let me out of this cell,
or I'll scream.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.621
(mary inhales deeply)

31:31.891 --> 31:33.891
(receding footsteps)

31:36.929 --> 31:39.463
- Sounds like she needs
a little more persuasion.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.269
- Ahem.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.771
- Oh, mr. Webley?

31:48.974 --> 31:50.407
There's something
I have to tell you.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.975
- Of course. What is it?

31:52.011 --> 31:54.278
- Well, I'm sorry
to tell you this, but...

31:54.413 --> 31:56.479
I don't think
annabelle's a real doctor.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.348
- Ah, excuse me?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.819
- She's been denying claims
based on underlying conditions

32:02.821 --> 32:05.422
That our clients don't
actually have. So I asked

32:05.424 --> 32:07.523
A friend to look
into the medical registry.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.692
She's not on it.

32:08.827 --> 32:11.128
- I don't believe it.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.965
Well, it seems you've proven
yourself a better investigator

32:14.967 --> 32:17.434
Than I could have imagined.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.069
I will speak with annabelle.
- Ah,

32:19.204 --> 32:22.005
All due respect,
but something like this requires

32:22.140 --> 32:23.773
More than a conversation.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.709
- What do you mean?
- If annabelle is not

32:25.711 --> 32:27.911
A real doctor,
she needs to be fired.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.380
- Yes, yes. I agree.
Something...

32:30.449 --> 32:32.215
Decisive must be done.

32:33.852 --> 32:34.985
Leave it to me.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.087
(intriguing jazz music)

32:40.125 --> 32:43.460
(bell ringing rapidly)
- excuse me. Sorry.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.862
Excuse me. Sorry.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.865
Excuse me.
(panting)

32:48.901 --> 32:51.935
(objects clattering)
(glass breaking)

32:52.070 --> 32:54.671
Steven! Steven!

32:57.876 --> 32:59.009
Are you all right?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.712
- Yeah.
(mary sighs)

33:03.882 --> 33:05.281
- What happened?

33:05.317 --> 33:07.484
- What's it look like?

33:07.619 --> 33:09.720
(mary gasps)
good guys, huh?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.423
- Was anyone hurt?
- No.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.959
But... It'll be months
before the paper will be able

33:15.961 --> 33:17.861
To print again.
(glass shattering)

33:20.966 --> 33:23.633
- Well, then, we'll
just have to find another
paper to print the article.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.201
- I thought you said it was
a mistake to publish

33:25.270 --> 33:26.770
Without a source.
- It is.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.538
The only way to bring down
hunter and lyle is

33:28.540 --> 33:30.707
With solid proof.
- But without albert steward--

33:30.709 --> 33:32.309
- You need me.

33:32.444 --> 33:33.443
- What?

33:33.578 --> 33:35.978
- I will go on the record
against them.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.015
(sombre music)

33:40.252 --> 33:42.252
(tinkling)
(nora sighs)

33:42.387 --> 33:44.454
(ned sighs)
- you sure you know

33:44.589 --> 33:46.656
Where you're going, ned?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.725
- Uh-huh. So where is
this vault, anyway?

33:49.762 --> 33:52.328
We've been walking for hours.
- It's been 20 minutes.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.330
- It's just up ahead.
Help me out.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.466
- Ooh, I got a stone in my shoe.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.535
- Ah. Here it is.
(thud)

33:58.604 --> 34:00.670
(metallic clanking)
- whoa!

34:00.806 --> 34:03.306
- No! Oh, no, no!
(breathing rapidly)

34:04.609 --> 34:07.477
Oh, no! Oh! Damn it.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.947
Well, it looks like
it's more a father-daughter

34:11.083 --> 34:12.883
Grift now, doesn't it?

34:12.885 --> 34:15.052
(tense jazz music)

34:22.094 --> 34:24.428
(distant indistinct speaking)
(frankie sighs)

34:24.563 --> 34:27.697
- What's that?
- Well... Sounds like they're

34:27.733 --> 34:29.633
Having an initiation tonight.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.101
Here we are.
Let's clear this stuff off.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.470
(click)
(whispering): Here, hide! Hide!

34:34.773 --> 34:36.907
(door creaks)
(indistinct chanting)

34:44.950 --> 34:46.650
- Who are you?
(frankie sighs)

34:48.620 --> 34:49.853
- Frankie drake.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.588
You knew my father, ned.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.823
- Hey, mcbride.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.593
We'd better get this sword
out to the ceremony,

34:56.595 --> 34:58.261
Or they'll think something's up.
- No, no. Des will make you

34:58.396 --> 35:00.931
In a second. I'll go.
- You don't know the ritual.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.666
- I'll wing it.
- How?

35:02.801 --> 35:04.167
- I'm a drake.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.136
I'll figure it out.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.407
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.676
(ned groans)

35:14.546 --> 35:15.478
(sighs)

35:15.514 --> 35:17.114
- (annabelle): Leaving so soon,
trudy?

35:20.151 --> 35:22.018
- Mr. Webley?
- Miss clarke,

35:22.154 --> 35:24.420
You are
an excellent investigator.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.489
- My husband told me
you did a little digging

35:26.624 --> 35:28.391
Into my credentials.
- Your husband?

35:28.527 --> 35:31.628
- Aha. Yes, I thought
that might come as a surprise.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.564
Needless to say,
I won't be leaving the company.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.367
- What's this?
- Our insurance policy,

35:37.502 --> 35:39.435
No pun intended.
- Why don't you

35:39.571 --> 35:41.071
Have a look
at the secondary signature

35:41.206 --> 35:42.772
On all those denied claims?

35:42.808 --> 35:46.309
- We think you'll find
it looks... Familiar.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.178
- That's not much
of an insurance policy.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.313
- Au contraire.
- You breathe a word

35:50.448 --> 35:52.115
Of what you know
to the authorities,

35:52.250 --> 35:53.449
Or anyone else,

35:53.485 --> 35:56.519
We'll say you were complicit
in our little arrangement.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.621
- No one will ever believe you.
- You sure about that?

35:58.657 --> 36:01.124
All an investigator has is
her reputation.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.661
You talk and,
once we're finished with you,

36:04.663 --> 36:08.198
Clients won't trust you
to find their lost dogs.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.333
- I'll take my chances.

36:10.468 --> 36:13.270
(sombre jazz music)

36:13.272 --> 36:14.737
(door opens)

36:14.773 --> 36:16.673
(footsteps)
(door shuts)

36:18.710 --> 36:21.044
(indistinct distant speaking)

36:23.748 --> 36:26.049
- (whispering): Come on, now.
Let's do it.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.618
All right.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.087
(clicking)
(clunking)

36:31.223 --> 36:33.890
Oh! Music to my ears.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.824
Come on!

36:34.959 --> 36:37.327
(groaning)

36:40.265 --> 36:42.132
Ah... Hello, beautiful.

36:46.171 --> 36:47.637
- (frankie): Let go of me!

36:47.673 --> 36:49.606
(voice echoes)
(dramatic music)

36:50.976 --> 36:52.642
- Just tell us where he is.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.777
- I have no idea where he is.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.479
I'm looking for him too.

36:56.481 --> 36:57.981
- You really expect me
to believe that?

36:58.116 --> 36:59.649
He's your father.
- Yeah.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.517
Well, he abandoned me.
- Still...

37:01.553 --> 37:03.453
Blood runs thick.
(frankie gasps)

37:03.588 --> 37:05.922
Maybe we should draw
some of yours,

37:06.057 --> 37:08.591
Teach the old man a lesson.
- Des!

37:08.660 --> 37:10.126
Let her go.

37:10.162 --> 37:11.461
It's me you want.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.862
- You.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.997
- No!

37:14.132 --> 37:16.433
- Ah!

37:16.435 --> 37:17.600
- Oh!

37:17.669 --> 37:20.870
- Stay away from my husband,
you filthy louse!

37:20.872 --> 37:23.606
- This bloody family!
- Ah!

37:23.609 --> 37:25.775
(grunting)

37:28.547 --> 37:30.580
(grunting)
- ah!

37:36.221 --> 37:37.620
(squelching)
(ned screams)

37:37.689 --> 37:39.388
(gasps)
- ah!

37:39.424 --> 37:40.991
- No!
- Neddie!

37:41.126 --> 37:43.392
- Out of my way.
It's not you I want.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.295
(grunting)
oh!

37:45.430 --> 37:47.464
- Oh, frankie! Come on.
- Go!

37:47.466 --> 37:50.099
- Come on!
- Go! Go!

37:50.135 --> 37:53.369
- Oh! Neddie!
- Oh, god.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.904
- Ah.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.140
- Oh.
(grunts)

37:58.777 --> 38:01.077
Oh!
(nora whimpering)

38:01.146 --> 38:04.414
- Ok. Are you going to be ok?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.984
- I'm a drake.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.052
I'll wing it.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.488
(ned grunts)

38:12.924 --> 38:15.058
- We gonna get out
of here or what?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.560
- Ok, come on.
- I got it. I got it.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.129
- Come on, dad.
- Ok. That's it.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.903
- Sure you want to do this?
- I'm here.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.672
- Heard you had a scoop for me.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.374
- This is the biggest scandal

38:31.410 --> 38:33.810
Ever to rock
the toronto police department.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.079
- That's nice

38:36.081 --> 38:38.447
And everything, but, uh...

38:38.483 --> 38:40.683
Corruption isn't exactly

38:40.686 --> 38:42.619
My beat.
- Your beat or not,

38:42.621 --> 38:44.887
Publishing this story is
for the good of the--

38:44.923 --> 38:47.090
- Uh, what he means,
tara, is that

38:47.092 --> 38:49.292
Publishing an exposé like this?

38:50.329 --> 38:52.329
It could make you famous.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.632
- Tell me everything.
- All right.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.635
- Ok.
- This is albert's story...

38:59.671 --> 39:01.771
(ned groans)
- hey, frankie,

39:01.906 --> 39:03.306
Do you remember
when I was little and you--

39:03.441 --> 39:06.242
You taught me to ride the bike?
And you bought me that little...

39:06.244 --> 39:08.511
The little red sled?
- We need to get him

39:08.513 --> 39:11.314
To a hospital.
- Ok. Here.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.249
Just sit here and I'll figure
out how to open up this gate.

39:13.285 --> 39:15.451
- All right.
- You don't have to
go through that trouble.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.853
- (frankie): Who's there?

39:18.590 --> 39:21.191
- Jack! What the hell
happened to you?

39:21.326 --> 39:22.925
- That's a story
for another time.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.127
Real news is I can
get you out of this place.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.729
(thud)
(metallic clanking)

39:26.732 --> 39:28.431
- That's my boy.
- Ok.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.800
- Dad! Are you ok?
- Yeah.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.469
I just got a scratch.
(ned groans)

39:33.505 --> 39:34.937
- Come on, come on.
Here. Let's sit you down.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.308
Come on.
- Ah! Ah! What?!

39:38.310 --> 39:40.343
- I'm really sorry about this.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.744
I gotta do what's right
for my son.

39:41.813 --> 39:42.879
- No. Jack.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.081
- You thieving little...

39:47.853 --> 39:49.685
(laughing)

39:49.721 --> 39:51.020
- That's my boy!

39:51.022 --> 39:52.389
(nora scoffs)

39:53.892 --> 39:56.259
(laughing)

39:56.394 --> 39:58.895
- What on earth
are you laughing at?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.097
We're trapped in this tunnel,
and your dad's bleeding

40:01.166 --> 40:04.367
Like a stuck pig!
(all laughing)

40:07.606 --> 40:09.439
- This family. What...

40:09.574 --> 40:11.974
(frankie sighs)
- you're a good kid, frankie.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.376
- Isn't she some'in?

40:13.378 --> 40:15.578
We sure did that right.
- Yeah.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.180
You always were.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.181
