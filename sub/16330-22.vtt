WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.738
(Patterson) Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:01.741 --> 00:03.107
My memories are coming back.

00:03.109 --> 00:05.677
The more I remember,
the more I hate you.

00:05.679 --> 00:07.278
Drop your weapons now!

00:07.280 --> 00:09.013
You're under arrest, Major General.

00:09.015 --> 00:11.616
(gunfire)

00:14.120 --> 00:15.887
Getting the word out
allowed Homeland Security

00:15.889 --> 00:17.288
to stop four other attacks,

00:17.290 --> 00:18.790
but two buildings just came down.

00:18.792 --> 00:20.291
Secret Service, sir.
You need to come with us.

00:20.293 --> 00:21.759
I'm not leaving my people.

00:21.761 --> 00:23.252
It's a matter of national security, sir.

00:23.277 --> 00:25.597
(Lawrence) It is our sworn
duty to remain in this bunker

00:25.622 --> 00:27.181
until otherwise notified.

00:27.206 --> 00:30.501
We alone become the successors
to the United States government.

00:30.503 --> 00:33.458
The attack on this country isn't over.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.450
It's just beginning.

00:37.607 --> 00:40.317
(Lawrence) All right,
C.O.G.S., settle in.

00:40.342 --> 00:42.909
We'll reconvene in three hours.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.163
It's the Truman protocol.

00:48.188 --> 00:49.520
Follow the C.O.G.S.

00:49.522 --> 00:50.888
It's just something I
heard Shepherd say once.

00:50.890 --> 00:53.024
(Keaton) Weller? Weller?

00:53.026 --> 00:55.146
How did we not know about this?

00:55.171 --> 00:56.628
This is an official order.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.193
"In the event all members in the
line of succession are deceased,

00:59.218 --> 01:01.531
"the Continuity of Government
Subcommittee, or C.O.G.S.,

01:01.556 --> 01:03.156
"shall assume power."

01:04.120 --> 01:05.920
Why is everyone so damn calm?

01:05.945 --> 01:08.640
I don't know, but Shepherd
knew about the subcommittee.

01:08.642 --> 01:10.775
- She put us here.
- How could she have?

01:10.777 --> 01:12.844
Every time a tattoo exposed corruption,

01:12.846 --> 01:14.744
somebody lost their job.

01:14.769 --> 01:16.836
I replaced Mayfair at the FBI,

01:16.861 --> 01:19.290
you replaced Carter at the CIA.

01:19.719 --> 01:22.120
Those two are now deputy directors

01:22.122 --> 01:24.389
of the CDC and the DEA.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.025
So, all the tattoos
were leading to this?

01:27.027 --> 01:29.427
Shepherd said something about a reset.

01:29.429 --> 01:30.962
We are that reset.

01:30.964 --> 01:32.630
We're Shepherd's new government.

01:32.632 --> 01:35.033
Which means that she's gonna try

01:35.035 --> 01:38.649
to wipe out the current
administration, today.

01:38.674 --> 01:40.618
We can't stay down here.

01:46.708 --> 01:49.013
Hey, Weller, it's, uh, it's me again.

01:49.015 --> 01:51.716
I just... I was just
calling to check in on you,

01:51.718 --> 01:53.207
make sure you're okay.

01:53.232 --> 01:55.620
I'm worried about you, so call me back.

01:55.622 --> 01:56.885
(phone beeps)

01:57.799 --> 02:00.573
Eleanor Hirst, acting director.

02:00.612 --> 02:02.493
I'm Sam Pellington's replacement.

02:02.495 --> 02:05.313
Oh, uh, I'm... I'm Jane.

02:05.338 --> 02:07.432
Please, I know who you are.

02:07.434 --> 02:09.298
How are you holding up?

02:09.323 --> 02:10.689
I'm fine.

02:10.691 --> 02:12.658
I'm so sorry.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.666
What you all went through...

02:14.691 --> 02:16.324
Have you heard from Weller?

02:16.349 --> 02:19.117
Not since Secret Service
picked him up last night.

02:19.142 --> 02:21.916
I'm sure he'll check in when he can.

02:22.112 --> 02:24.403
Look, I've been going over your file.

02:24.405 --> 02:28.397
Your deal with
Pellington, with Nas Kamal,

02:28.422 --> 02:31.811
it essentially makes
you prisoner of the FBI.

02:31.813 --> 02:34.834
But once this Sandstorm
mess gets cleaned up,

02:34.858 --> 02:36.758
you'll be freed of
any further obligation,

02:36.783 --> 02:40.228
given a new identity and relocated to...

02:40.230 --> 02:42.386
wherever it is you'd like to go.

02:48.805 --> 02:50.471
I'm a part of this team.

02:50.473 --> 02:52.273
Nobody's saying you're not.

02:52.275 --> 02:55.510
But Jane, ever since
you came out of that bag,

02:55.512 --> 02:59.254
every aspect of your life
has been decided for you.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.350
Hell, even your name.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.623
I think you need to ask yourself,

03:03.648 --> 03:05.787
what do you want?

03:11.210 --> 03:12.765
We better get the hell outta here.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.696
We have to tell these people
what's really going on.

03:14.698 --> 03:17.332
No, it's too risky. What
if they're with Shepherd?

03:17.334 --> 03:18.900
Let's at least loop in these soldiers.

03:18.902 --> 03:21.223
No. Sandstorm's everywhere.

03:21.248 --> 03:23.215
- Do you understand that?
- Okay, but we're in an underground bunker

03:23.240 --> 03:25.513
with no weapons and no phones.
What other choice do we have?

03:25.538 --> 03:28.009
Look, if we trust the
wrong person, it's over.

03:28.011 --> 03:29.978
Not just for us. For the whole country.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.181
- Now, I gotta get back to my team.
- Your team, or Jane?

03:33.183 --> 03:35.550
I don't get you. You don't trust anyone.

03:35.552 --> 03:36.951
But after everything that's happened,

03:36.953 --> 03:38.786
you still trust her?

03:38.788 --> 03:40.855
There's gotta be a phone down here.

03:40.857 --> 03:42.690
Let's find it.

03:44.415 --> 03:46.794
We got the preliminary reports
on yesterday's explosives.

03:46.796 --> 03:48.212
Let me guess... HMX?

03:48.237 --> 03:50.634
No. It's actually this other
type of nitroamine explosive.

03:50.659 --> 03:52.100
- CL-20?
- Yeah.

03:52.102 --> 03:53.358
Wow, how did you know that?

03:53.383 --> 03:56.147
Please... I know my
nitroamine explosives.

03:56.172 --> 03:58.606
CL-20 makes HMX look like Pop Rocks.

03:58.608 --> 04:00.408
The good news is it's pretty exotic,

04:00.410 --> 04:02.076
so run secondary tests.

04:02.078 --> 04:04.458
Hey, Patterson.

04:04.483 --> 04:06.614
Is there anything I can do to...

04:06.616 --> 04:09.170
I mean, look around. It's over.

04:11.473 --> 04:12.806
Sorry.

04:12.831 --> 04:15.082
It's just these last few
days and months have...

04:15.107 --> 04:17.550
I get it. It's all been...

04:17.873 --> 04:19.173
Hell.

04:19.199 --> 04:20.761
Yeah.

04:21.498 --> 04:23.941
But if you could walk
away, you wouldn't, right?

04:24.035 --> 04:25.566
You'd stay.

04:25.591 --> 04:27.702
Where's this coming from?

04:27.704 --> 04:30.831
Just, uh, I just met
with Director Hirst.

04:30.856 --> 04:33.236
- Is she firing people?
- No, um...

04:33.261 --> 04:36.088
she was just pushing me
to think about the future.

04:36.113 --> 04:39.480
Once this is all over,
she's giving me the option

04:39.482 --> 04:41.683
to relocate to wherever I want.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.152
Wow.

04:43.537 --> 04:45.764
Well, you...

04:45.789 --> 04:48.355
you deserve to do what you want.

04:51.006 --> 04:52.957
What if I want this?

04:52.982 --> 04:56.481
How do you know if you've
never done anything else?

04:56.506 --> 04:58.973
We can't all stay here forever.

04:58.998 --> 05:02.552
Reade's talking about
teaching, and Weller...

05:03.023 --> 05:05.512
he's gonna be a dad in a couple months.

05:05.537 --> 05:08.242
And this kid is living
in Colorado, so...

05:08.244 --> 05:09.607
You think Kurt'll move?

05:09.632 --> 05:11.927
I mean, I would.

05:15.396 --> 05:17.154
I'm sorry.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.021
I know that's not what...
I don't know what he'll do.

05:29.373 --> 05:31.265
I wonder if the people
that are relaxing upstairs

05:31.267 --> 05:32.433
have seen this room.

05:32.435 --> 05:34.736
I guess that's the telephone.

05:35.185 --> 05:37.005
- Original switchboard.
- Yeah.

05:37.007 --> 05:40.138
- You got any idea how to work that?
- Maybe.

05:42.169 --> 05:43.411
It's a direct dial out line.

05:43.413 --> 05:44.912
Which means if we can get a dial tone,

05:44.914 --> 05:47.115
there's a chance we can make a call out.

05:48.084 --> 05:49.607
Nothing.

05:54.483 --> 05:56.505
- (dial tone)
- Whoa, whoa.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.590
(phone buzzing)

06:00.969 --> 06:02.168
Hello?

06:02.193 --> 06:03.972
Patterson, it's Weller.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.246
How are you calling
from a 000 area code?

06:06.271 --> 06:08.051
- I didn't even know those existed.
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

06:08.091 --> 06:09.240
Phase two isn't over.

06:09.265 --> 06:10.864
(gunshot)

06:11.763 --> 06:13.911
Weller? Weller!

06:13.936 --> 06:16.255
Put the phone down,
Assistant Director Weller.

Did we stop them?

Don't worry about that now.
I'll fill you in later, okay?

06:44.092 --> 06:45.698
Did we get Shepherd?

06:45.723 --> 06:47.155
No.

Then this isn't over.

06:53.748 --> 06:55.211
Get down on your knees.

06:57.115 --> 07:00.216
We are rebuilding this
nation, do you understand that?

07:00.218 --> 07:02.284
Shepherd's scraping out the rot.

07:02.286 --> 07:04.313
We're gonna restore this country.

- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah.

07:42.213 --> 07:43.628
What exactly did Weller say?

07:43.653 --> 07:45.795
Just that phase two isn't over,
and then the line went dead.

07:45.797 --> 07:47.029
We have to find him.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.297
Weller wouldn't want us to focus on him.

07:48.299 --> 07:49.706
He would want us to focus on Sandstorm,

07:49.731 --> 07:50.831
so that's what we're gonna do.

07:50.856 --> 07:53.565
We gotta figure out where
Shepherd's going to attack next.

07:54.393 --> 07:57.773
Yesterday, Sandstorm targeted
seven buildings simultaneously.

07:57.775 --> 07:59.126
All government facilities.

07:59.151 --> 08:01.243
There's gotta be some other connection

08:01.245 --> 08:02.445
that we're just not seeing.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.079
Maybe we're asking the wrong questions.

08:04.081 --> 08:05.993
I mean, what does Shepherd want?

08:06.018 --> 08:07.293
(Reade) Besides mass terror?

08:07.318 --> 08:09.251
Today's meeting. At the White House,

08:09.253 --> 08:10.886
the president's holding
a full cabinet meeting

08:10.888 --> 08:12.323
to discuss security protocols.

08:12.348 --> 08:14.256
Just like they always do
after every major attack.

08:14.258 --> 08:17.204
Right, but what if yesterday's
attacks were a catalyst?

08:17.229 --> 08:19.762
To get all of our leaders
together in the same room?

08:19.764 --> 08:21.862
So she can wipe out the government.

08:23.666 --> 08:24.837
I'll update Hirst,

08:24.862 --> 08:26.535
we'll brief the president,
order a full evacuation.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.502
Start digging into the attack plan.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.284
How does Shepherd plan to hit the
most secured building on the planet?

08:32.308 --> 08:35.349
I don't know. But after
yesterday, we're at DEFCON-1.

08:35.374 --> 08:38.542
Civilians can't even get within
a mile of the White House.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.698
Wait.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.565
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.223
CL-20.

08:45.837 --> 08:47.674
I know who we can talk to.

08:48.471 --> 08:50.181
Does this look familiar
to you, Mr. Riley?

08:50.206 --> 08:52.050
- I've never seen that before.
- (chuckles)

08:52.052 --> 08:53.924
You're telling me you
don't know what CL-20 is?

08:53.949 --> 08:55.839
Hm, figured someone in your line of work

08:55.864 --> 08:57.487
- would probably know.
- It's rocket fuel.

08:57.512 --> 09:00.923
Which also doubles as one of the
most potent explosives on the planet.

09:00.948 --> 09:02.534
Which you sold to a terrorist.

09:02.559 --> 09:04.127
That's quite the logic leap.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.956
The CL-20 used in yesterday's attacks

09:05.964 --> 09:07.847
bears the same chemical
marker as the rocket fuel

09:07.872 --> 09:09.271
your company makes.

09:09.273 --> 09:10.550
Then my company was robbed.

09:10.574 --> 09:12.007
(Reade) You really expect
us to believe someone

09:12.032 --> 09:14.260
stole all that CL-20
and no one took notice?

09:14.285 --> 09:16.645
How is Shepherd planning
to attack the White House?

09:16.647 --> 09:18.621
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.542
Kurt? Kurt!

09:22.453 --> 09:24.824
(chuckles, sighs)

09:30.762 --> 09:32.324
- I thought you were...
- I'm all right.

09:32.348 --> 09:34.396
Look, Shepherd's gonna try
to wipe out the government.

09:34.398 --> 09:36.996
- We know.
- We think Zach Riley's involved.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.605
Keaton.

09:40.823 --> 09:42.538
What in the hell is he doing here?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.065
I don't expect you to like me, Jane,

09:44.090 --> 09:46.034
but we're gonna have
to play nice right now.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.073
(Patterson) Here's what we know.

09:48.098 --> 09:50.010
Jane and Roman stole a
chip from Bradley Dynamics

09:50.042 --> 09:52.108
which Sandstorm has yet to utilize.

09:52.110 --> 09:54.544
We think it's a guidance chip,
but for what, we don't know.

09:54.545 --> 09:56.979
What about Shepherd?
Any recent activity?

09:56.981 --> 09:58.214
Travel? Communications?

09:58.239 --> 09:59.915
She went to Bangkok last week.

09:59.917 --> 10:02.551
- We don't know why or...
- (Keaton) I think I might.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.353
CIA's been monitoring the gang

10:04.355 --> 10:06.995
that controls the Chao Phraya waterway.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.992
In the last week, their
leader was murdered

10:08.993 --> 10:10.225
in a deal gone bad.

10:10.227 --> 10:11.553
(Hirst) What kind of deal?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.803
The intel we had said they
were selling nuclear material.

10:14.828 --> 10:16.031
What?

10:16.033 --> 10:17.414
The CIA should have
shared that immediately.

10:17.439 --> 10:18.977
Oh, you mean like how
the FBI's been sharing

10:19.002 --> 10:20.646
all that intel on Sandstorm?

10:20.671 --> 10:22.404
I didn't even know
Shepherd was in Thailand

10:22.406 --> 10:24.186
- until about two seconds ago, Kurt...
- Enough!

10:24.211 --> 10:26.467
Shepherd has nuclear material.

10:26.492 --> 10:27.876
Let's move forward.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.278
How you wanna play this?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.013
Reade, pair up with Keaton,

10:31.015 --> 10:33.482
try and retrace Shepherd's
movements post-Bangkok.

10:33.484 --> 10:36.051
And Patterson, keep looking
into Riley, all right?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.672
And try and find something
that we can interrogate with.

10:37.697 --> 10:40.155
In the meanwhile, let's
keep each other updated.

10:44.361 --> 10:46.428
What's your take on Hirst?

10:46.430 --> 10:49.414
She's super smart, a bit of a maverick.

10:49.439 --> 10:51.079
Uh, for instance,

10:51.104 --> 10:53.977
she plans to release Jane.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.694
Jane's leaving?

10:56.719 --> 10:58.719
She's thinking about it.

10:58.744 --> 10:59.991
Why?

11:00.016 --> 11:02.352
I might have, sort of...

11:02.994 --> 11:04.772
encouraged her to.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.249
- Excuse me?
- She didn't choose this, Kurt.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.367
So, if there's something
that you wanna say to her,

11:10.940 --> 11:13.063
I wouldn't put it off.

11:16.265 --> 11:18.165
(phone buzzing)

11:20.125 --> 11:21.864
- Zapata, you okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:21.866 --> 11:23.899
I mean, minus the whole
bullet wound thing.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.300
I've been watching news coverage

11:25.302 --> 11:27.362
- on yesterday's attacks and...
- <i>Come on, man,</i>

11:27.387 --> 11:28.670
you promised me you would take it easy.

11:28.672 --> 11:30.172
Watching TV is taking it easy.

11:30.197 --> 11:32.262
Tasha, I'm serious.
Hey, look, I gotta go.

11:32.287 --> 11:33.942
- Wait, is something else...
- <i>No, there's nothing.</i>

11:33.944 --> 11:35.332
We're just trying to make
sense out of yesterday.

11:35.357 --> 11:36.691
I'll call you later.

11:36.716 --> 11:38.614
(monitor beeping)

11:38.616 --> 11:42.535
(solid electronic tone)

11:43.894 --> 11:46.012
We know the CL-20 came from you.

11:46.037 --> 11:47.710
We know that Shepherd is
planning a massive attack

11:47.735 --> 11:49.807
in D.C. using nuclear material.

11:49.832 --> 11:51.113
Nuclear material?

11:51.138 --> 11:53.252
Your sister lives right
outside of Baltimore.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.113
- Is this what you really want?
- Oh, my God.

11:55.138 --> 11:57.222
What is she planning?!

11:57.463 --> 11:59.652
Help us stop this.

12:00.644 --> 12:03.160
Shepherd asked me to
launch a satellite for her.

12:05.137 --> 12:06.542
(Weller) <i>A satellite for what?</i>

12:06.544 --> 12:08.379
<i>Disrupt emergency communications?</i>

12:08.404 --> 12:09.644
Oh, my God.

12:09.669 --> 12:12.214
- <i>I wanted to topple the government.</i>
- Move, move, move!

12:12.216 --> 12:13.882
I didn't wanna hurt civilians.

12:13.884 --> 12:16.318
I knew there'd be
casualties, but not like this.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.453
Does the satellite control the weapon?

12:18.455 --> 12:20.122
Kinetic bombardment.

12:20.124 --> 12:21.824
The satellite <i>is</i> the weapon.

12:21.826 --> 12:24.777
Shepherd plans to
bomb D.C., doesn't she?

12:26.160 --> 12:27.622
How?

12:27.832 --> 12:30.699
The satellite is designed
to launch a glider

12:30.701 --> 12:32.201
at hypersonic speeds.

12:32.203 --> 12:34.636
It is undetectable, it's unstoppable,

12:34.638 --> 12:36.638
but it was only supposed
to target the White House.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.408
But now, it's gonna hit
Shepherd's nuclear material,

12:39.410 --> 12:41.722
which is probably already
on the ground in Washington.

12:41.747 --> 12:43.178
There's gotta be some
way that we can stop it.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.080
No. The glider has a guidance chip,

12:45.082 --> 12:46.294
but it can't be overwritten.

12:46.319 --> 12:47.749
The chip I stole with Roman.

12:47.751 --> 12:50.667
If Shepherd has as much nuclear
material as we're thinking,

12:50.692 --> 12:53.045
evacuating the White House does nothing.

12:53.070 --> 12:56.905
This attack will wipe out
the whole Eastern seaboard.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.669
_

13:02.128 --> 13:04.770
I'm so glad you're here with me.

13:05.264 --> 13:07.535
I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.419
I'll loop in NASA.

13:24.444 --> 13:26.630
We could use their support
and cooperation on this.

13:26.655 --> 13:27.738
Thank you.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.294
How are we gonna find Shepherd's nukes?

13:29.319 --> 13:30.585
Nukes?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.724
Damn it, Zapata, you shouldn't be here.

13:32.749 --> 13:34.177
You need to go back to the hospital.

13:34.202 --> 13:36.067
Are you two done mothering me?

13:36.092 --> 13:37.591
Now, who's gonna catch me up?

13:37.593 --> 13:39.260
I will.

13:39.262 --> 13:41.676
Since when do we work with the CIA?

13:41.701 --> 13:44.230
Hospital or Keaton, your choice.

13:44.255 --> 13:46.968
I'll search for Shepherd's
nuclear material via drone.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.369
See, I used to fly F-15s...

13:48.371 --> 13:50.193
Yeah, yeah, I'm super impressed.

13:50.506 --> 13:52.073
The domestic drone program...

13:52.075 --> 13:53.380
- is actually...
- In the building. I know, I work here.

13:53.405 --> 13:55.776
Okay, enough. You two, partner up.

13:55.778 --> 13:58.012
Find her stockpile. Jane
and I will fly to D.C.

13:58.014 --> 13:59.447
Be ready to follow up when I land.

13:59.449 --> 14:00.815
Everyone, stay on comms.

14:00.817 --> 14:02.931
Wait, before we split up,

14:02.956 --> 14:04.385
maybe we should say...

14:04.387 --> 14:06.345
No, we shouldn't, all right?
We shouldn't say a thing.

14:06.370 --> 14:08.032
This is not goodbye.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.729
(Keaton) This search technology

14:14.731 --> 14:16.797
is basically an X-ray on steroids.

14:16.799 --> 14:18.366
It detects nuclear radiation...

14:18.368 --> 14:20.698
I know what muon tomography is, Jake.

14:20.723 --> 14:23.536
Right. Yeah, sorry.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.036
- How are you feeling?
- Now you're gonna start with that.

14:26.061 --> 14:28.708
Look, I just... I admire you.

14:28.733 --> 14:31.445
- I mean, you're playing hurt.
- I'm doing my job.

14:31.447 --> 14:33.581
Coming back to work the
day after you're shot

14:33.583 --> 14:35.886
is a lot more than doing your job.

14:35.911 --> 14:38.986
You ever think about putting
your natural intensity

14:38.988 --> 14:40.458
to better use?

14:41.290 --> 14:43.737
The CIA could use someone like you.

14:43.762 --> 14:45.073
No, they couldn't.

14:45.098 --> 14:48.095
We would have gotten intel from Roman,

14:48.097 --> 14:49.740
I'll tell you that much.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.317
I said no.

14:58.374 --> 15:00.374
The team's gonna meet
us on the ground in D.C.

15:00.376 --> 15:01.876
Okay.

15:05.851 --> 15:07.913
Patterson told me that...

15:08.640 --> 15:10.506
you're thinking of leaving.

15:11.268 --> 15:12.670
Uh...

15:12.695 --> 15:14.155
maybe.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.506
You should go somewhere fun.

15:17.193 --> 15:19.077
You think I should go?

15:19.806 --> 15:22.170
You didn't choose this life, Jane.

15:23.186 --> 15:25.453
This team will miss you.

15:25.908 --> 15:27.920
It's not fair to keep you here.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.832
I hear California's pretty nice.

15:37.682 --> 15:39.729
Well, what about you?

15:39.754 --> 15:41.303
L.A.?

15:41.545 --> 15:43.436
That would be fun, but...

15:44.506 --> 15:46.513
what about Colorado?

15:46.538 --> 15:48.138
I'll visit there a lot.

15:48.163 --> 15:49.936
You should take your own advice.

15:49.961 --> 15:52.124
Denver has a field office, right?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.787
You're allowed to be happy, you know.

15:57.321 --> 15:59.118
We both are.

16:01.516 --> 16:03.680
Riley's still claiming the
satellite's un-hackable.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.290
Yeah, 'cause his ego's the same size

16:05.315 --> 16:06.681
as the moon he's trying to colonize.

16:06.706 --> 16:08.641
(Hirst) I brought some reinforcements.

16:08.666 --> 16:10.796
These are the agents I
was telling you about.

16:10.821 --> 16:13.165
- Patterson and Reade.
- Thank you for coming.

16:13.190 --> 16:14.943
Eileen Baldwin, this is Gary Lemarsh.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.401
We're from the Goddard Institute

16:16.426 --> 16:17.792
NASA satellite office in New York.

16:17.817 --> 16:19.060
Okay, great. Uh...

16:19.085 --> 16:21.044
I have some preliminary theories,

16:21.069 --> 16:24.123
but obviously, space is a
little bit out of my wheelhouse.

16:24.279 --> 16:26.245
So, it looks like the satellite

16:26.247 --> 16:29.029
is un-hackable from Earth,

16:29.054 --> 16:31.951
but from space... it's
a totally different story.

16:31.953 --> 16:34.027
So what, we're just supposed
to shoot you up there?

16:34.052 --> 16:35.521
- Not advisable.
- I wanted to.

16:35.546 --> 16:38.558
Well, I don't need to be, um, in space.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.394
I just need to transmit
a signal from space.

16:41.396 --> 16:43.544
- That's where you guys come in.
- What are you thinking?

16:43.569 --> 16:45.387
The "Reader's Digest" version.

16:45.412 --> 16:46.544
Okay.

16:46.569 --> 16:48.878
This is us.

16:48.903 --> 16:52.138
And this... is the
International Space Station.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.271
- That is not to scale.
- Eileen!

16:54.296 --> 16:57.343
And this is Shepherd's satellite.

16:57.345 --> 16:59.111
We capitalize on their proximity,

16:59.136 --> 17:02.225
ask the space station if they
can launch their Soyuz capsule.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.217
All right, now, we're officially
out of "Reader's Digest" territory.

17:04.219 --> 17:05.550
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

17:05.553 --> 17:07.987
The Soyuz is kinda like a space taxi.

17:07.989 --> 17:10.223
So, if we can just get them

17:10.248 --> 17:12.154
to just drive it out
there to the satellite.

17:12.179 --> 17:13.992
Yes, so the hack can
come from the Soyuz.

17:13.994 --> 17:15.951
- From that proximity, that's...
- Yeah, that is unorthodox.

17:15.976 --> 17:18.598
But clever as hell. Let me
get Houston on the phone,

17:18.599 --> 17:20.857
I'll see if we can
authorize a Soyuz launch.

17:21.669 --> 17:23.903
And this isn't your wheelhouse?

17:23.905 --> 17:26.068
Color me terrified.

17:37.252 --> 17:39.552
Shepherd's stockpile is
either really well-hidden

17:39.554 --> 17:41.921
or we're looking in the wrong place.

17:43.185 --> 17:45.869
What if she did what
every two-bit dealer does?

17:45.893 --> 17:48.194
Hide their stash in something else?

17:48.196 --> 17:49.795
Like packing heroin in coffee grounds.

17:49.797 --> 17:51.163
Right, so what are her coffee grounds?

17:51.165 --> 17:53.132
What hides nuclear material?

17:53.134 --> 17:54.500
- Lead.
- Lead.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.493
Yeah, we should be looking for lead.

18:10.848 --> 18:13.730
How much longer till the
satellite is deactivated?

18:13.755 --> 18:16.022
Five, ten minutes. I'm trying
to corrupt its telemetry.

18:16.024 --> 18:17.857
Houston, are you seeing this?

18:17.859 --> 18:20.993
We have irregular motion on
the satellite's power subsystem.

18:20.995 --> 18:22.805
- Is everything okay?
- No.

18:22.830 --> 18:26.032
The satellite's initiated its
preliminary firing sequence.

18:26.034 --> 18:27.290
What?

18:27.315 --> 18:28.501
No, no, no, no, no.

18:28.503 --> 18:29.835
I'll never hack it in time.

18:29.837 --> 18:31.938
You better do something else.

18:33.085 --> 18:35.418
(siren whooping)

18:35.443 --> 18:37.777
(cell phone ringing)

18:37.802 --> 18:39.489
Tasha, what do you got?

18:39.514 --> 18:42.348
I think we found Shepherd's
nuclear stockpile.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.350
<i>I'm sending Jane the GPS coordinates</i>

18:44.352 --> 18:46.252
<i>and aerial surveillance photos now.</i>

18:46.254 --> 18:48.621
- Yeah, got 'em.
- <i>And we're looping in the Pentagon.</i>

18:48.623 --> 18:50.117
All right, we're heading that way now.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.425
Kurt, Shepherd's nuclear
material is in the back

18:52.450 --> 18:55.236
of what looks to be a
lead-lined ambulance.

18:55.261 --> 18:56.326
(Weller) <i>Keep your eyes on it.</i>

18:56.351 --> 18:57.963
Tasha, call in backup.

18:57.988 --> 18:59.241
(Zapata) <i>Copy.</i>

19:00.517 --> 19:03.518
(siren whooping)

19:07.008 --> 19:09.008
(Shepherd) I've got two cops on our six.

19:09.010 --> 19:10.443
You think they know?

19:10.445 --> 19:12.413
We can't afford to find out.

19:13.117 --> 19:14.741
Take care of them?

19:29.678 --> 19:31.011
(phone pinging)

19:31.818 --> 19:33.576
_

19:36.637 --> 19:38.637
(engine starting)

19:42.436 --> 19:45.478
Uh, what if... what if
we physically try to block

19:45.480 --> 19:47.012
the satellite with the Soyuz?

19:47.014 --> 19:49.676
- Like man-to-man defense?
- Yeah, David versus Goliath.

19:49.701 --> 19:51.504
It'll give us enough
time to finish the hack.

19:51.529 --> 19:52.918
If the satellite's programmed to fire

19:52.943 --> 19:54.754
once it hits certain
celestial coordinates...

19:54.756 --> 19:56.555
Then we just need to delay its arrival

19:56.557 --> 19:58.324
at those coordinates.

19:58.326 --> 20:00.226
Houston, I need you
to position the Soyuz

20:00.228 --> 20:02.495
in the path of the satellite.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.092
No, you heard me correctly.

20:20.009 --> 20:22.281
It's... it's working! It's actually...

20:22.283 --> 20:24.183
- But it'll never hold.
- Why not?

20:24.185 --> 20:25.484
Because the satellite
is Shaquille O'Neal

20:25.486 --> 20:26.652
and the Soyuz is me.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.506
I like my biblical reference better.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.951
Gotcha, it's not a fair fight.

20:29.976 --> 20:31.631
It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.

20:31.659 --> 20:33.058
Well, by my calculations,

20:33.060 --> 20:35.318
your Band-Aid's bought us six minutes.

20:41.402 --> 20:44.256
(sirens)

20:55.411 --> 20:57.044
Turn that truck off!

21:00.683 --> 21:02.217
Turn the truck off!

21:04.795 --> 21:06.228
Turn it off!

21:10.866 --> 21:12.810
Show us your hands!

21:12.835 --> 21:14.959
Show me your hands!

21:18.153 --> 21:20.216
Keep them where we can see them!

21:26.339 --> 21:29.173
(gunfire)

21:44.544 --> 21:46.176
(man groaning)

21:47.070 --> 21:48.234
- (Weller) Clear?
- (Jane) Clear.

21:48.259 --> 21:50.742
Tasha, send the
paramedics to our location.

21:56.178 --> 21:58.781
- You got eyes on her, Jane?
- No.

22:02.635 --> 22:03.834
(Jane) Clear.

22:05.593 --> 22:06.827
(Weller) Clear.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.427
(gunshot)

22:29.904 --> 22:31.007
(gunshot)

22:31.032 --> 22:33.786
(sirens)

22:37.832 --> 22:40.302
All right, team, we got Shepherd.

22:40.810 --> 22:42.660
- (beeping)
- _

22:42.685 --> 22:44.411
(Patterson) Oh, my God.

22:45.103 --> 22:46.702
That's it.

22:53.154 --> 22:56.008
It's over. The glider just launched.

22:56.010 --> 22:57.466
What?

22:57.679 --> 22:58.966
How long until...

22:58.991 --> 23:01.507
We have 30 minutes until
it strikes the Capitol.

23:02.968 --> 23:04.951
Patterson, what happened?

23:04.953 --> 23:06.609
I couldn't hack it in time,

23:06.634 --> 23:09.199
but the glider appears to
communicating with a homing beacon.

23:09.224 --> 23:10.990
Is there some way that
we can clone the beacon

23:10.992 --> 23:12.225
<i>and send the glider to the ocean?</i>

23:12.227 --> 23:13.492
That's what she's trying to do.

23:13.494 --> 23:15.061
(Jane) How much time do we have?

23:15.063 --> 23:17.169
29 minutes until the point of no return.

23:17.194 --> 23:19.319
I bet the beacon's on her.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.140
(Shepherd gasping)

23:24.233 --> 23:25.921
I can't feel it on her.

23:26.307 --> 23:27.873
We have to get this
truck out of the city

23:27.875 --> 23:29.505
- <i>to reduce the casualties.</i>
- (Zapata) Okay.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.744
We'll direct you to the
least populated area.

23:31.746 --> 23:33.616
What if we could contain the fallout?

23:34.866 --> 23:36.899
(typing)

23:40.327 --> 23:43.713
Okay, there's a defunct railroad tunnel

23:43.738 --> 23:45.304
just outside of D.C.

23:45.329 --> 23:46.995
It'll limit the fallout's range

23:47.020 --> 23:48.887
and prevent some of it from
entering the atmosphere.

23:48.912 --> 23:52.372
(Zapata) <i>But you're gonna have to
get there before impact, and...</i>

23:52.397 --> 23:54.741
you're not gonna make it back.

24:00.154 --> 24:01.911
You stay with Shepherd.
I'm gonna take the truck.

24:01.936 --> 24:03.489
No, I'm not letting you go alone.

24:03.514 --> 24:05.544
Whoever takes that
truck is not coming back.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.872
So, you stay with Shepherd.

24:06.897 --> 24:08.496
You both have to go.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.354
Patterson, this is between me and Jane.

24:10.379 --> 24:11.745
(Patterson) <i>No, listen to me!</i>

24:11.770 --> 24:14.380
I have been trying to spoof
the beacon and it's not working.

24:14.405 --> 24:17.279
The glider won't sustain
contact with my decoy

24:17.304 --> 24:19.872
because the actual beacon still exists.

24:19.897 --> 24:22.001
- So, we have to find it.
- And destroy it.

24:22.026 --> 24:23.732
But we don't have a lot of time.

24:23.757 --> 24:25.821
If the glider gets
within five miles of D.C.,

24:25.846 --> 24:27.250
there will be nothing I can do,

24:27.274 --> 24:29.165
and if it gets past this point,

24:29.385 --> 24:30.711
it is over.

24:33.352 --> 24:34.383
You drive.

24:34.408 --> 24:35.528
- Yeah.
- I'll look for that beacon.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.893
What do you wanna do with her?

24:36.918 --> 24:39.003
- I'm not letting her out of my sight.
- (chuckles)

24:39.028 --> 24:41.055
You'll never make it in time.

24:49.264 --> 24:51.693
(Shepherd screaming)

24:53.790 --> 24:56.269
All right, Patterson...

24:56.271 --> 24:57.813
what's this thing supposed to look like?

24:57.838 --> 24:59.407
(Patterson) <i>Should be
a small metal device,</i>

24:59.432 --> 25:01.618
probably about the size of a quarter.

25:01.643 --> 25:03.176
It's a big truck, Patterson.

25:05.305 --> 25:07.330
Zapata, I just turned
down Ward. What next?

25:07.355 --> 25:08.977
Take a left on 22nd.

25:09.002 --> 25:11.136
(tires screeching, Weller
and Shepherd grunting)

25:11.161 --> 25:13.548
(horns honking)

25:17.596 --> 25:19.025
(Shepherd groaning)

25:22.807 --> 25:24.525
(Zapata) <i>Jane, take MacArthur Boulevard.</i>

25:24.550 --> 25:26.509
It's the only way you'll make
it to the tunnel before impact.

25:26.511 --> 25:27.791
(Jane) <i>Copy.</i>

25:33.213 --> 25:35.417
(Patterson) Look, it might be a
long shot, but I'm sending an app

25:35.419 --> 25:37.319
to your phone now, I
just reprogrammed it.

25:37.321 --> 25:39.158
It might be able to detect the beacon.

25:39.183 --> 25:40.221
_

25:40.291 --> 25:42.087
All right, I got my phone in my hand.

25:42.112 --> 25:44.293
Okay, open it and scan the space

25:44.295 --> 25:45.828
like you're waving a metal detector.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.805
But we have to go off comms.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.837
- Why?
- <i>The app detects frequencies</i>

25:49.862 --> 25:52.034
and it could interfere... just trust me.

25:52.036 --> 25:53.669
<i>I'll switch you off on our end,</i>

25:53.671 --> 25:55.271
but I'll check back in in 90 seconds.

25:55.273 --> 25:57.420
Hey, Kurt... good luck.

25:58.775 --> 26:00.041
What now?

26:00.066 --> 26:02.764
Now... we wait.

26:03.781 --> 26:06.215
(Shepherd) Its admirable
how dedicated you are.

26:06.217 --> 26:09.018
See? We're not so different.

26:09.020 --> 26:12.514
We both sacrifice for what
we believe is right, Kurt.

26:12.539 --> 26:15.145
That's why I wanted you
for our new government.

26:15.170 --> 26:18.027
You're dedicated, you're honorable.

26:18.029 --> 26:21.397
I knew that no matter how much
you'd hate me for what I'd done,

26:21.399 --> 26:23.975
you'd do the right
thing for your country.

26:24.748 --> 26:26.569
You can't be corrupted Kurt.

26:26.571 --> 26:29.538
Stop calling me Kurt! You don't know me.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.522
Yes, I do.

26:31.842 --> 26:33.976
I never wanted to hurt you.

26:33.978 --> 26:36.178
But you found out too much.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.213
I couldn't let you stop me.

26:38.215 --> 26:39.481
(phone pinging)

26:39.483 --> 26:42.084
Can't you see? I'm sacrificing myself

26:42.086 --> 26:44.086
so that this nation can be reborn!

26:44.088 --> 26:46.789
(pinging intensifies)

26:52.100 --> 26:54.083
You swallowed it, didn't you?

26:54.593 --> 26:56.660
(gunfire)

27:05.576 --> 27:06.719
(gasps)

27:43.863 --> 27:47.306
(Patterson) <i>Weller? Weller, do you copy?</i>

27:47.331 --> 27:48.878
<i>Weller?</i>

27:48.903 --> 27:50.646
Jane? Jane?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.128
Weller, are you okay?

27:53.207 --> 27:54.473
We were hit.

27:54.475 --> 27:56.008
What do you mean? Hit how?

27:56.010 --> 27:58.343
<i>- We crashed.</i>
- Can you move?

27:58.345 --> 28:00.879
(breathing heavily)

28:03.003 --> 28:06.143
<i>Weller? Do you copy?</i>

28:06.372 --> 28:07.719
<i>Can you move?</i>

28:07.721 --> 28:09.521
Yeah, I think so.

28:09.523 --> 28:11.757
Then you're gonna have to
keep looking for that beacon.

28:11.759 --> 28:14.259
If you don't find it
within the next two minutes,

28:14.261 --> 28:16.261
that glider will pass fail-safe.

28:19.339 --> 28:21.253
- I found it.
- <i>What are you waiting for?</i>

28:21.278 --> 28:23.815
- Destroy it!
- Shepherd swallowed it.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.315
I got an idea.

28:33.814 --> 28:36.081
(Jane moans)

28:39.143 --> 28:41.065
Kurt. Kurt!

28:41.101 --> 28:43.634
(grunting)

28:58.820 --> 29:02.151
(Shepherd grunting)

29:02.176 --> 29:04.735
No, no, no. No, wait!

29:04.760 --> 29:07.102
Kurt, don't do this. No.

29:07.938 --> 29:09.242
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:09.267 --> 29:11.009
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't do it, don't...

29:11.034 --> 29:12.733
(grunting)

29:14.062 --> 29:16.297
Patterson, did it work?

29:17.873 --> 29:19.758
<i>Patterson, did it work?</i>

29:21.158 --> 29:23.692
Come on, come on, little
decoy, connect, connect.

29:39.498 --> 29:41.060
Aah!

29:41.085 --> 29:43.474
(Weller) <i>Patterson, did it work?</i>

29:44.081 --> 29:45.631
No.

29:47.665 --> 29:49.831
(grunting)

29:50.654 --> 29:52.187
Patterson!

29:52.189 --> 29:54.156
- <i>Did it work?</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

29:56.889 --> 29:58.137
_

29:58.162 --> 30:00.591
It's working. The decoy just rerouted.

30:00.616 --> 30:01.927
It's working!

30:01.952 --> 30:03.819
(cheers and applause)

30:07.470 --> 30:09.003
<i>Weller, we did it.</i>

30:09.028 --> 30:11.728
The glider is... is following my decoy.

30:11.753 --> 30:13.720
<i>It's heading to the Atlantic.</i>

30:14.813 --> 30:16.513
(Weller) <i>Nice job, Patterson.</i>

30:30.318 --> 30:31.738
Do it.

30:40.014 --> 30:41.581
Do it.

30:49.332 --> 30:50.915
Do it!

30:50.940 --> 30:52.862
(groaning)

31:06.797 --> 31:08.478
Goodbye, Jane.

31:17.108 --> 31:18.583
Stop! Hey!

31:18.608 --> 31:20.006
(grunting)

31:20.031 --> 31:21.798
Kurt! Hey!

31:21.823 --> 31:23.145
Kurt?

31:23.147 --> 31:25.116
Kurt, hey. Say something.

31:25.141 --> 31:26.538
Jane...

31:28.058 --> 31:30.194
Don't move to California.

31:32.012 --> 31:33.991
Stay here...

31:34.305 --> 31:36.105
with me.

31:38.854 --> 31:41.221
(whispering) I love you, Jane.

31:43.267 --> 31:44.845
I love you.

31:55.572 --> 31:57.206
(elevator bell dings)

31:57.619 --> 32:00.721
(cheers and applause)

32:00.763 --> 32:02.807
Looking good, Peg-Leg.

32:06.339 --> 32:07.872
Good job.

32:08.764 --> 32:10.897
We were very worried about you.

32:13.846 --> 32:15.625
We weren't that worried.

32:15.627 --> 32:17.226
(both laughing)

32:22.200 --> 32:24.175
So good to see you guys.

32:24.201 --> 32:25.666
All of you.

32:27.150 --> 32:29.572
- Where's Jane?
- (Hirst) She's fine.

32:29.574 --> 32:33.409
I'm just waiting for the
official all-clear from medical.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.891
Hell of a job, Assistant
Director Weller.

32:35.916 --> 32:38.369
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You did it.

32:38.702 --> 32:40.268
<i>We</i> did it.

32:40.775 --> 32:43.619
We all did it.

32:43.621 --> 32:46.807
Every one of you in this room,

32:47.125 --> 32:49.455
you all made this possible.

32:49.480 --> 32:53.854
Since Jane got here,
you've all worked non-stop

32:54.188 --> 32:57.205
to find who did this and why.

32:58.057 --> 33:01.047
And you've risked your
lives and sacrificed so much

33:01.072 --> 33:04.607
to get the answers that
we needed to stop Sandstorm

33:04.609 --> 33:06.305
and bring them to justice.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.260
And yesterday,

33:08.285 --> 33:10.670
we didn't just take down their leader.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.760
We saved a nation.

33:13.785 --> 33:18.416
So, thank you and well
done to all of you.

33:18.441 --> 33:20.942
(applause)

33:23.461 --> 33:26.197
So, where is Shepherd now?

33:26.846 --> 33:28.931
Right where she belongs.

33:28.933 --> 33:31.367
(wincing)

33:31.369 --> 33:34.727
You can do what you want
to me. I'll never break.

33:34.752 --> 33:36.872
It's not me you have to worry about.

33:36.874 --> 33:38.340
(door opening)

33:40.745 --> 33:42.533
Hello, Shepherd.

33:42.691 --> 33:44.525
My name is Nas.

33:50.059 --> 33:51.260
Hey.

33:51.285 --> 33:52.650
Hey.

33:53.658 --> 33:55.041
For your scrapbook.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.572
_

33:58.362 --> 33:59.762
How are you feeling?

33:59.787 --> 34:01.404
Probably better than you.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.462
(chuckles)

34:04.805 --> 34:07.346
What happened with Roman?

34:07.764 --> 34:11.186
You guys took down Shepherd,
so how is Roman still out there?

34:11.210 --> 34:12.927
Read the report.

34:16.606 --> 34:18.716
Jane didn't have the shot.

34:19.868 --> 34:21.232
Understood.

34:31.661 --> 34:35.793
It has been a long couple of days.

34:35.819 --> 34:38.263
Yeah, it has.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.504
- So, what now?
- What do you mean?

34:43.529 --> 34:46.101
We rebuild and get
ready for the next one.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.427
Yeah.

34:52.452 --> 34:53.992
(sobbing)

34:54.016 --> 34:55.529
I'm just...

34:55.553 --> 34:58.155
I'm just so tired.

35:03.427 --> 35:05.795
You guys started drinking without me?

35:08.019 --> 35:09.431
Harsh.

35:09.433 --> 35:11.500
(drink pouring)

35:11.502 --> 35:13.152
What's wrong?

35:14.972 --> 35:16.185
(sighs)

35:16.210 --> 35:18.489
I used to love everything...

35:19.377 --> 35:21.744
everything about this job. (sniffling)

35:21.746 --> 35:23.615
And now, I just...

35:23.640 --> 35:24.980
Now, what?

35:24.982 --> 35:26.515
(sighs)

35:27.670 --> 35:30.364
I know how you feel,
Patterson, believe me.

35:30.755 --> 35:34.790
This job takes
everything from all of us.
