Previously on
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.872 --> 00:07.073
{\an8}What do I have to do?

00:07.140 --> 00:09.809
{\an7}I just--
I need you to be there.

00:09.876 --> 00:12.045
{\an8}I promise to be here through
this whole journey with you.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.114
{\an8}I will not let you down, okay?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.181
{\an7}So what about Ray?
You think he's coming?

00:16.248 --> 00:18.017
{\an7}Or should we wait
a little bit?

00:19.152 --> 00:20.420
{\an9}No.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.088
{\an8}I upgraded the ring.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.089
{\an8}Yeah...

00:23.156 --> 00:24.391
{\an9}Ooh!

00:24.457 --> 00:25.658
{\an8}What is this?

00:25.725 --> 00:27.794
{\an8}Oh, this is my new ring.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.530
{\an8}I want you to be happy,
but when you marry A1,

00:30.597 --> 00:34.200
{\an7}you're marrying all of his
issues, all of his dysfunction.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.103
{\an8}So what's gonna happen when
y'all get married?

00:37.170 --> 00:39.072
{\an7}It's to the point
where I'm like, yo,

00:39.139 --> 00:41.674
{\an7}we should just
run off and elope.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.643
{\an8}(minister)
It is my great honor

00:43.710 --> 00:45.245
{\an8}to pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.547
{\an8}You may seal your vows
with a kiss.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.282
{\an7}(giggles)

00:49.349 --> 00:50.717
{\an8}I feel like I'm
living a double life.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.419
{\an8}I have a girl and a guy.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.753
{\an8}You don't feel like
you need to, like,

00:53.820 --> 00:56.456
{\an8}tell somebody, one of them?

00:56.523 --> 00:58.458
{\an7}You were spotted
with Safaree.

00:58.525 --> 00:59.592
{\an8}Yeah, I could have friends.

00:59.659 --> 01:00.894
{\an7}They asked them,
"Are you guys together?"

01:00.960 --> 01:02.295
{\an7}and he was like,
"Hee hee hee hee hee."

01:02.362 --> 01:04.263
{\an8}Well, open to interpretation.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.170
{\an7}Y'all going with...
(bleep)

01:10.236 --> 01:12.539
{\an7}I just want you to know that,
at the end of the day,

01:12.605 --> 01:13.773
{\an8}it'll never
really be the same.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.275
{\an8}Like, we was
Bonnie and Clyde,

01:15.341 --> 01:16.876
{\an8}and now it's like,
I don't even understand

01:16.943 --> 01:17.977
{\an8}why you're
here right now.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.512
{\an7}I've heard
about your wife.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.048
{\an7}I do know that she's
popped up on studio sessions

01:22.115 --> 01:23.616
{\an8}and things like that.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.452
{\an7}It's not gonna be an issue
with her, let me deal with her.

01:25.518 --> 01:26.753
{\an7}Okay.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.488
{\an7}I'm trying to understand what
the (bleep) this is.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.489
{\an8}A session.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.857
{\an7}This is
my husband's session.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.525
{\an7}If I say there's no session,
there will be no session.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.760
{\an8}That's not true.

01:33.827 --> 01:34.961
{\an7}You need to stop talking
(bleep), little girl.

01:35.028 --> 01:35.995
{\an8}Bitch, get the (bleep)
outta here.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.030
{\an8}Go (bleep) yourself.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.905
It's hot as a mother(bleep)
outside, goddamn!

02:18.972 --> 02:20.273
It ain't no kids
in here, right?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.041
Okay, cool.
(bleep), it's hot.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.376
How everybody doing?
All right?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.111
{\an5}What up with it?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.111
What's up, my G?

02:25.178 --> 02:26.846
{\an5}Chilling. All right.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.846
{\an1}Chilling?

02:26.913 --> 02:28.081
{\an1}I got
something new, though.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.716
{\an5}Y'all know about Raytroniks.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.716
{\an3}Whoo whoo!

02:29.782 --> 02:31.784
Y'all know about
the sponge that make--

02:31.851 --> 02:33.353
You know, that make
your hair curly,

02:33.419 --> 02:35.922
but nobody really never
put the "uhh" to it.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.591
So this is the sponge
and the brush.

02:38.658 --> 02:43.062
Mixed together, we calling
our product the Sprush.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.132
Sprush?
I like that.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.301
{\an1}I went from Raytroniks
to hair-troniks.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.069
(Ray J)
This is a game-changer.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.006
{\an8}It turns your fro into curls

02:53.072 --> 02:54.307
{\an8}without the texturizer,

02:54.374 --> 02:55.909
{\an8}without the Jheri curl cream.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.912
And I got my Scoot-E Bike store
opening up on Melrose soon,

02:58.978 --> 03:02.048
so you can get the Sprush and
the Scoot-E Bike in one rip.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.384
Troniks, baby.
(chuckling)

03:04.450 --> 03:05.552
Oh, we on.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.153
How everything going
with the engagement?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.656
{\an1}Princess, she mad
as a mother (bleep).

03:09.722 --> 03:10.957
{\an1}You ever heard
of a cake testing?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.325
{\an5}Y'all did that?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.325
{\an3}Yeah.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.426
{\an8}You taste all the cakes
for the wedding?

03:13.493 --> 03:14.727
{\an8}You taste the cake?

03:13.493 --> 03:14.727
{\an9}Got to.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.263
{\an1}I told her I was gonna
come to test the cakes out.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.899
{\an1}But I was caught up.
I mean, I gotta stay working.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.435
{\an1}Marriage is gonna cost
at least 250, 300.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.070
At the end of the day,
you just gotta tell her

03:24.137 --> 03:25.872
that you working
to make sure y'all good.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.008
I know I messed up when
I missed the cake tasting,

03:29.075 --> 03:31.277
and I feel bad about it,
but trying to balance

03:31.344 --> 03:33.179
love and marriage

03:33.246 --> 03:35.181
and building this empire
at the same time,

03:35.248 --> 03:36.883
it's all jacked up!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.918
I just gotta figure out
how the help Princess

03:38.985 --> 03:42.555
with the wedding
and keep my business afloat

03:42.622 --> 03:44.791
without Princess killing me
at the same time.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.225
{\an1}What's up
with you, man?

03:46.292 --> 03:49.028
{\an1}Last time I seen you,
you was sleeping in the studio.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.563
You know, I didn't
even go to the crib.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.965
I was at the studio,

03:52.031 --> 03:54.567
and Masika hit me up
like, "Yo, what's up?"

03:54.634 --> 03:56.336
So I let her
come to the studio,

03:56.402 --> 03:57.370
'cause I was like,
you know...

03:57.437 --> 03:58.504
So what happened, man?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.073
{\an1}Don't tell me
what you about to tell me.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.674
Man, you know
what happened.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.610
{\an1}Sure enough, soon as I
was in the studio with her,

04:03.676 --> 04:04.711
B popped right up.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.279
{\an1}What?

04:06.346 --> 04:08.615
{\an1}Yeah, she came into the studio
to give me 15 bands.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.616
She brought 15,000.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.950
She brought 15?

04:11.017 --> 04:13.019
Yeah, but she came
in the studio, saw Masika.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.354
{\an1}What'd she do?
She was ready to fight?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.422
She was turnt up.
You already know.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.858
{\an5}Then Masika started
barking back and Brandi
ready to knock her out.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.995
What Masika have on?

04:22.060 --> 04:23.663
I don't even remember
what she had on.

04:23.730 --> 04:24.964
{\an1}You remember
what she had on, (bleep).

04:25.031 --> 04:26.299
I don't want to remember
what she had on.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.400
{\an1}Nah, I'm just saying,
did she have her titties out?

04:27.467 --> 04:28.468
{\an1}'Cause she if she had
her titties out

04:28.534 --> 04:29.569
{\an1}and little Brandi
walk in...

04:29.636 --> 04:30.637
They might have been
out a little bit.

04:30.703 --> 04:31.804
{\an1}It's a problem.
When I get married,

04:31.871 --> 04:32.905
{\an1}I'm gonna
have a whole booklet

04:32.972 --> 04:34.741
on how to make sure
you stay faithful.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.242
No titties out
in my studio.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.510
That's a sign right there.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.711
{\an1}Your titties
is out too much,

04:38.778 --> 04:40.313
{\an1}too much cleavage,
you know what I'm saying?

04:40.380 --> 04:41.514
{\an1}We got sweaters
in the back for you.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.049
I just want
to get back to where

04:43.116 --> 04:45.284
{\an1}we ain't got to keep
no secrets from each other,

04:45.351 --> 04:46.352
you know what I'm saying?

04:46.419 --> 04:47.620
We could work together.

04:47.687 --> 04:48.855
I want her to trust me.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.556
And I want to be able
to trust her.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.326
All this fighting with B is not
how I want to live my life.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.095
I know B's not comfortable with
me working with female artists,

04:56.162 --> 04:58.598
{\an5}so from now on,
I'm gonna just give it to her
straight and up front.

04:58.665 --> 05:01.234
But I'm gonna need Brandi to
keep up her end of the bargain

05:01.300 --> 05:04.070
and keep it 100 with me,
moving forward.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.471
And I'm willing
to forgive her

05:05.538 --> 05:07.640
for taking the 27 bands
for the store

05:07.707 --> 05:10.276
as long as something like
that never happens again.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.644
It's ups and downs,
bro-bro.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.079
{\an1}You gotta go through
the ups and downs

05:13.146 --> 05:14.347

Hey, yo.
Take five, man.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.567
Good,
you're working.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.668
What's up, lil' mama?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.804
{\an5}How are you?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.804
I'm good, how are you?

05:37.870 --> 05:39.205
I'm good, I'm good.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.307
{\an8}I've been working on getting
my career back on track,

05:41.374 --> 05:43.076
{\an8}so I'm going to meet
with my old friend,

05:43.142 --> 05:44.310
Brian Michael Cox.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.045
He's really big
in the R&amp;B world.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.714
He's won about eight Grammys

05:47.780 --> 05:49.849
and he worked with me
on my first album.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.051
He always keeps it real
with me.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.520
{\an1}I wanted to talk to you 'cause
I know you've known me

05:54.587 --> 05:56.289
{\an4}from the beginning
of my career.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.289
Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.491
And I'm just ready
to get back there,

05:58.558 --> 06:02.762
{\an7}and I just want someone to be
very, very honest with me.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.397
{\an1}Do you think
I could do it again?

06:04.464 --> 06:06.599
{\an1}Do you think that
it's possible?

06:06.666 --> 06:09.502
If we take a look back on,
you know, what happened.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.937
You know, you signed
to Def Jam,

06:11.003 --> 06:12.271
signed to Roc-A-Fella,

06:12.338 --> 06:13.506
you put a record out
that was a hit.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.707
The potential was crazy.

06:14.774 --> 06:15.942
{\an4}Yeah.

06:14.774 --> 06:15.942
{\an3}And...

06:16.008 --> 06:18.377
for it to stop, kinda,
like, suddenly,

06:18.444 --> 06:19.946
outta nowhere,
you know what I mean?

06:20.012 --> 06:21.948
{\an5}You had this record...

06:20.012 --> 06:21.948
I mean, just, like, bam.

06:22.014 --> 06:22.949
No, literally,
one day it was...

06:23.015 --> 06:24.217
Yeah, this and the next--

06:24.283 --> 06:25.818
{\an1}The next day, it was
something totally different.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.954
Jay Z signed me to Roc-A-Fella
when I was 16 years old,

06:28.020 --> 06:30.289
and in the middle of recording
my second album,

06:30.356 --> 06:32.291
I was released from my contract.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.793
One minute, I had everything,

06:33.860 --> 06:35.595
the next minute,
it was all gone.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.131
And since then, I've been
trying to prove to people

06:38.197 --> 06:41.400
that I have what it takes
and I'm worth another shot.

06:41.467 --> 06:45.037
L.A. had a quote about
him making a misstep

06:45.104 --> 06:49.342
in regards to making you
a priority over Rihanna.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.911
This L.A. Reid comment
comes up all the time.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.280
He signed me and Rihanna
at the same time.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.482
He said something like
he regretted not paying

06:56.549 --> 06:58.751
more attention to Rihanna
or something like that.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.453
I don't really know,
'cause at the time,

07:00.520 --> 07:01.687
I didn't pay attention.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.791
{\an1}To be honest with you,
I never even gave myself

07:04.857 --> 07:06.325
{\an1}a chance to feel
anything about it,

07:06.392 --> 07:08.594
{\an1}because when you think
about what he said,

07:08.661 --> 07:10.196
that's pretty heavy.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.098
{\an1}Tell me, like,
if you were in a room

07:12.165 --> 07:15.635
{\an1}with a bunch of industry people
and my name was brought up...

07:15.701 --> 07:16.702
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.704
{\an1}...what would
the conversation be?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.773
I think people would say
that you were crazy.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.044
I think all the questions
would be, like,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.513
"Why is she on this blog?
Why is she acting crazy?"

07:27.580 --> 07:29.248
{\an1}I know that I haven't
represented myself

07:29.315 --> 07:30.349
in the best way possible.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.417
{\an3}Yeah.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.820
And I know that
that's not me.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.221
That's not who I am.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.356
You have an opportunity
to change that.

07:37.423 --> 07:41.093
The most forgiving thing
that could ever happen

07:41.160 --> 07:42.261
is putting out
some great music.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.763
{\an1}Yeah.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.231
{\an1}And right now, you're in
a really interesting position,

07:45.298 --> 07:46.999
because you have a platform.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.000
{\an1}Right.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.802
People know your story.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.372
{\an4}Now you have to work harder
than you've ever
worked before.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.242
And people, other
creatives that see that,

07:56.309 --> 07:59.111
{\an1}if they see you helping
yourself, they gonna come--

07:59.178 --> 08:00.213
they gonna come on in.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.714
This is why
I came to B. Cox.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.583
Because he's not gonna
blow smoke up my ass,

08:03.649 --> 08:05.017
and he's not gonna kiss it,
either.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.786
He's 100% right.

08:06.853 --> 08:10.289
If I put out good music, then
people will forget the B.S.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.225
{\an1}(sighs)
Thank you so much.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.260
I really appreciate
this conversation.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.877
{\an8}So eloping was wild,

08:30.943 --> 08:33.645
{\an8}and now that I am
officially Mrs. Bentley,

08:33.712 --> 08:36.015
we can move into our new home

08:36.082 --> 08:37.683
as husband and wife,

08:37.750 --> 08:40.820
the way God
and my super religious mother

08:40.886 --> 08:42.054
wanted it to be.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.290
(squealing)

08:44.357 --> 08:46.425
Ooh, you're picking me up!

08:46.492 --> 08:47.827
Put me down.

08:47.894 --> 08:51.564
A1 and I were living
in that tiny condo way too long,

08:51.631 --> 08:52.965
and when Pam moved in,

08:53.032 --> 08:55.034
it just made it feel
even smaller.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.003
It was just time
for a bigger place.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.337
I think we should decorate

08:58.404 --> 09:01.140
{\an8}and probably do, like,
a housewarming party.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.475
{\an5}You know what we should do?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.475
{\an3}What?

09:02.541 --> 09:04.310
{\an5}I have an idea.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.310
{\an3}What?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.345
{\an1}We'll make people think
it's a housewarming party,

09:06.412 --> 09:08.281
but it'll really
be a reception.

09:08.347 --> 09:12.685
{\an1}And maybe my mom will
be a lot more receptive

09:12.752 --> 09:14.253
{\an1}to the fact
that we got married.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.689
You're doing that so
she won't black your eye.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.457
{\an1}Oh, yeah, that, too.
No, seriously.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.092
{\an1}'Cause there's gonna be
so many people here,

09:20.159 --> 09:21.961
{\an1}she'll be, like,
not feel comfortable

09:22.028 --> 09:23.429
{\an1}to get so mad when
we tell her the news

09:23.496 --> 09:24.463
in front of everybody.

09:24.530 --> 09:25.598
I don't know.

09:25.665 --> 09:26.999
I don't know,
they gonna be mad.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.467
{\an4}How do you think
your mom will take it?
I don't know.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.636
Nah, they gonna be upset.
I ain't even gonna front.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.739
Throwing this house party-
slash-wedding reception

09:33.806 --> 09:35.508
I know is a crazy idea,

09:35.574 --> 09:37.510
but look, they gotta
find out somehow,

09:37.576 --> 09:39.512
and they might just
blow our new house down.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.380
But guess what, we're happy,

09:41.447 --> 09:43.049
and y'all gotta
know what's up now.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.217
When do you
want to tell her?

09:45.284 --> 09:47.353
{\an1}I don't know, babe,
but it's got to be soon,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.088
{\an1}'cause I already ran off
and got married,

09:49.155 --> 09:51.757
and then now, like,

09:51.824 --> 09:53.793
{\an1}I can't hold that
from my mom too long.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.428
{\an3}Ah-yah.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.264
{\an1}And now we have to also live
with the decision we made

09:58.331 --> 10:00.399
{\an1}and the reaction that
they're gonna have by it,

10:00.466 --> 10:02.902
{\an1}but it's just like,
at the end of the day...

10:02.969 --> 10:04.403
It's just us
against the world.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.805
It's us against the world.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.341
I can just imagine the look
on Lyrica G.'s face

10:08.407 --> 10:09.809
when she hear this announcement.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.712
It's about time that she get it
through her thick skull

10:12.778 --> 10:15.681
that Lyrica's grown and she can
make her own decisions,

10:15.748 --> 10:18.284
and there's not a damn thing
that she can do about it.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.485
We can just, you know...

10:19.552 --> 10:20.820
{\an4}(laughing)

10:19.552 --> 10:20.820
{\an3}Take it in.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.054
{\an1}Ahh.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.222
Make some love.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.691
Mmm... mmm...

10:25.758 --> 10:27.393
You a little early.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.995
(squeals and laughs)

10:32.865 --> 10:33.799
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

10:33.866 --> 10:34.800
{\an8}You have
to go to court?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.268
{\an8}What's going on now?

10:36.335 --> 10:40.139
{\an7}I didn't agree to the plea deal,
and now I'm going to trial.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.009
{\an7}I could be in jail
for 30 days to six months.

10:44.176 --> 10:47.113
{\an7}This is not just
a housewarming party.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.448
{\an7}This is our
wedding reception.

10:49.515 --> 10:50.449
{\an8}(glass breaking)

10:51.550 --> 10:52.551
{\an9}Ohh...

10:52.618 --> 10:54.887
{\an8}You can have this picture.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.122
{\an8}(glass shatters)

10:56.188 --> 10:57.456
{\an8}That's what I care
about your picture.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.798
♪♪

11:08.267 --> 11:10.102
{\an8}(Teairra)
I've been hitting
the studio hard,

11:10.169 --> 11:11.937
{\an8}trying to get together
this new project,

11:12.004 --> 11:13.606
{\an8}and you know what they say--

11:13.672 --> 11:15.141
{\an8}work hard, play hard.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.476
{\an8}So today, I'm meeting up
with my girls

11:17.543 --> 11:20.312
and my old roomie Andrew
to celebrate Nikki's birthday.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.082
Andrew is one of the closest
people to me in L.A.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.617
We used to live together
for a minute.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.385
I know I can count on him
for anything.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.421
{\an1}Hey!
Oh, my goodness.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.623
{\an5}Hey!

11:28.487 --> 11:30.623
Look at you.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.957
{\an1}Hi, guys.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.292
Hey.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.693
{\an5}Happy birthday.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.693
Thank you.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.129
A day out with my girls
is all that I need

11:37.196 --> 11:38.731
{\an8}to forget about all the drama

11:38.798 --> 11:40.466
{\an8}that has been going on
in my life.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.368
I'm taking a step back
from my marriage

11:42.435 --> 11:44.437
and I'm finally
exploring what life is like

11:44.503 --> 11:46.138
without having to check in
with my husband.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.406
{\an1}(Teairra)
Where do you want to go?

11:47.473 --> 11:50.309
{\an1}It's your birthday, bitch,
I love you.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.578
{\an1}Put your glasses up
for Nikki, because...

11:52.645 --> 11:53.779
Miss Nikki Baby.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.748
Not only is it
her birthday...

11:55.815 --> 11:58.984
{\an6}Yes.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.984
...but she's the MVP.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.286
{\an1}(laughing)
First of all.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.353
Thank you.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.522
{\an1}I'm so proud
to call you a friend.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.825
T.T.'s sitting here
calling me the MVP,

12:05.891 --> 12:07.626
but it doesn't really
make me feel good.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.662
{\an8}I haven't really talked
to Safaree since the incident,

12:09.728 --> 12:11.831
{\an8}and Rosa's only been
talking to me about business,

12:11.897 --> 12:13.866
so I don't really know
where either of us stand.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.601
I have an event coming up
at Rosa's store

12:15.668 --> 12:16.836
launching my lingerie.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.438
And, honey, the show
must always go on.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.473
Guys, what are we doing
after this?

12:20.539 --> 12:21.774
'Cause after this shot, honey,

12:21.841 --> 12:23.175
none of us could drive,
though, after this.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.643
{\an1}No, I can't
drive, bitch.

12:24.710 --> 12:25.878
We gotta call
an Uber, honey.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.713
{\an1}We're gonna go
to the next place

12:27.780 --> 12:29.515
{\an1}and then we're gonna call
a Uber from there.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.716
No, we're calling
a Uber from here.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.618
Wait, T.T., can you even
get an Uber, bitch?

12:32.685 --> 12:33.619
Or are you banned?

12:33.686 --> 12:34.687
No, I'm banned.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.888
(Nikki)
You banned?

12:35.955 --> 12:36.755
But I thought that
Uber (bleep) was,

12:36.822 --> 12:38.257
like, a year or two ago.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.427
{\an1}Because, I didn't agree
to the plea deal.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.661
Yeah, what the (bleep)
did you do, Teairra?

12:42.728 --> 12:44.230
I didn't do (bleep).

12:44.296 --> 12:46.065
{\an5}(Teairra)
About a year ago,
I got into an incident

12:46.132 --> 12:47.533
with an Uber driver,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.736
{\an8}and there are still pending
charges against me.

12:50.803 --> 12:54.273
{\an8}I need to be focused right now
getting my music back on track,

12:54.340 --> 12:57.476
not dealing with this dumbass
case that just won't go away.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.145
So what kinda charges
is he trying to press

12:59.211 --> 13:01.413
against you, for what,
doing what?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.582
{\an1}Um, well, petty theft,
for one, because I did--

13:03.649 --> 13:04.783
{\an5}Petty theft?

13:03.649 --> 13:04.783
Well, I was--

13:04.850 --> 13:06.118
What the (bleep)
did you do?!

13:06.185 --> 13:07.119
I was upset.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.587
{\an1}The police came
and they said

13:08.654 --> 13:10.556
{\an1}a citizen's
mother(bleep) arrest.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.057
Have you ever
heard of that?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.225
A citizen's arrest?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.226
You were in jail?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.794
{\an1}Yeah!
A citizen's arrest.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.029
{\an1}That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.798
{\an1}I could be in jail
for 30 days to six months,

13:19.865 --> 13:21.734
so stop laughing, okay?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.369
{\an5}(Nikki)
I'm really concerned
about Teairra,

13:23.435 --> 13:25.271
because when she drinks,
sometimes her temper

13:25.337 --> 13:26.805
could be a little bit
out of control,

13:26.872 --> 13:28.541
and it honestly scares me.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.576
I have distanced myself
from her a little bit,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.012
but maybe it's time
for me to step in as a friend

13:33.078 --> 13:34.613
and really let her know
what's going on.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.348
Where does it stand?
You have to go to court?

13:36.415 --> 13:37.750
What's going on now?

13:37.816 --> 13:39.118
I'm going to trial.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.120
{\an1}But if God wants me
to sit down,

13:41.187 --> 13:42.588
then I'm gonna sit down.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.223
Even if God wanted you
to sit down,

13:44.290 --> 13:45.558
you don't have
to do it like that.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.093
I've made my bed,
and now I'm laying in it.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.763
I'm not proud of this mess,
but I'm dealing with it.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.998
I've done nothing wrong
and hopefully the judge

13:53.065 --> 13:55.901
can see that, and if not,
then what can I do?

13:55.968 --> 13:57.102
You're such
a bad bitch.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.137
{\an5}Can we cheers?

13:57.169 --> 13:58.137
Let's cheers.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.738
{\an1}Guys, cheers
to all of our futures.

13:59.805 --> 14:00.973
{\an3}All of us!

14:01.040 --> 14:02.308
(overlapping chatter)

14:09.148 --> 14:11.016
I feel like Nikki played me,

14:11.083 --> 14:14.019
took advantage of me,
and I really feel bad

14:14.086 --> 14:16.989
{\an8}because I was feeling like
Jason was the shady one,

14:17.056 --> 14:20.092
so I invited Jason
to come to the gym.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.228
I have to apologize to him
and I have to let him know

14:22.294 --> 14:23.529
that he was right.

14:24.730 --> 14:25.998
{\an1}Hey.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.567
Hi. I'm glad
you're here.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.002
(chuckling)
How are you?

14:30.069 --> 14:32.104
{\an8}When I got the text from Rosa
that she wanted to talk,

14:32.171 --> 14:34.740
{\an8}I could tell that she knew
that Nikki and Safaree

14:34.807 --> 14:36.308
{\an8}are more than she's been saying.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.877
It was only a matter of time
before this (bleep) blew up.

14:38.944 --> 14:42.114
I guess you know
that Nikki was, like,

14:42.181 --> 14:43.282
really talking to Safaree.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.484
No, I didn't know that.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.820
{\an1}I heard
they were friendly.

14:47.886 --> 14:48.821
What do I do?

14:48.887 --> 14:50.756
Do I get involved

14:50.823 --> 14:52.558
{\an1}and (bleep) up
a good thing that--

14:52.625 --> 14:56.195
{\an1}or what was at least perceived
to be a good thing by you?

14:56.262 --> 15:00.099
{\an4}Or do I just allow
your business to not be
my business at that point?

15:00.165 --> 15:01.600
{\an3}Right.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.269
This guy says that they
are building something.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.504
Safaree Minaj and Nikki.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.006
{\an1}Did you call him
Safaree Minaj?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.241
Yes. He's lame.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.010
{\an1}He came in there, like,
talking about, like, you know,

15:11.076 --> 15:13.712
{\an1}"I wanna watch" or something.
"I wanna join."

15:13.779 --> 15:14.947
He wants to watch what?

15:15.014 --> 15:16.382
{\an5}Like, me and Nikki.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.382
Was he serious?

15:16.448 --> 15:19.485
{\an1}Any guy who finds out
that their girl

15:19.551 --> 15:21.587
{\an1}is interested
in another girl,

15:21.654 --> 15:25.090
{\an1}as if he's not enough, would...
make him feel a certain way.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.295
I stand some (bleep),

15:29.361 --> 15:30.796
but I ain't got nothing to do
with this one.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.064
You can have
more than one lover,

15:32.131 --> 15:33.365
but be open and honest about it,

15:33.432 --> 15:35.668
because telling lies
is <i> no bueno.</i>

15:35.734 --> 15:36.735
{\an1}Where are you
with everything?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.070
I don't want to hang out
with Nikki.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.538
{\an1}I don't want to see her,
I don't want to talk to her.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.740
She's much younger
than me, so...

15:41.807 --> 15:43.809
{\an1}maybe she's not in that
stage of her life, of, like,

15:43.876 --> 15:47.313
just finding somebody that
can help her, like, grow.

15:47.379 --> 15:50.382
{\an4}All this happening
right before we're supposed
to do the pop-up shop.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.383
What are you gonna do?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.185
I'm not gonna
stop my business

15:53.252 --> 15:55.521
{\an5}just because Nikki
did something stupid.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.521
{\an1}Right.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.457
I am really upset
that all this stuff happened

15:58.524 --> 16:01.026
right before my event.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.428
But you know what?

16:02.494 --> 16:04.830
I'm not gonna let that
in the way of my business.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.332
I am gonna run that pop-up,
honey,

16:06.398 --> 16:07.499
and it's gonna be fabulous.

16:07.566 --> 16:10.235
{\an1}So you would never
date a Safaree?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.706
Put some respect
on my name, please.

16:13.772 --> 16:14.740
I would never.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.974
{\an3}I hate you.

that I eloped

16:40.299 --> 16:42.368
{\an8}or eloping in the first place.

16:42.434 --> 16:45.337
There is no perfect way
to tell my mom,

16:45.404 --> 16:48.407
but I figure,
why not do it at a party,

16:48.474 --> 16:51.710
so I'm using my friends
as bait to calm her.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.112
(giggles)

16:53.178 --> 16:54.213
I'll kick it off.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.748
I'm gonna
just be like, Yo...

16:55.814 --> 16:57.983
"everybody, thank y'all
for coming out.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.785
"Uh, housewarming party.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.021
{\an8}It's actually
a reception party."

17:03.088 --> 17:04.757
{\an1}No, but you have to say,
"It's actually a reception party

17:04.823 --> 17:07.760
{\an1}because Lyrica
and I are married."

17:07.826 --> 17:09.261
Just to think about the look
I'm gonna have to see

17:09.328 --> 17:11.363
on my mom's face
when I break that news to her

17:11.430 --> 17:13.298
makes me just want to pull
the plug and be like,

17:13.365 --> 17:15.200
"Never mind,
we not gonna do it that way."

17:15.267 --> 17:16.635
{\an3}Let's go.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.137
Oh, my goodness.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.974
(overlapping chatter)

17:25.243 --> 17:26.178
(woman)
Hey...

17:26.244 --> 17:27.246
{\an3}(man)
Hey!

17:27.311 --> 17:29.148
{\an5}What's going on?

17:27.311 --> 17:29.148
{\an3}Hey!

17:29.214 --> 17:30.482
{\an1}(Lyrica A.)
How are you guys?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.551
(Lyrica G.)
Even though I've not been happy

17:32.618 --> 17:36.822
about my daughter and A1 living
together, not being married,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.291
I am excited
about their new home.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.659
{\an1}I would like
to make a toast.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.127
Whoo, spilly, spilly.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.029
Welcome to our home.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.365
{\an1}You know, this is our
beautiful housewarming,

17:46.432 --> 17:49.768
{\an1}and it's really a blessing
to move into a new home,

17:49.835 --> 17:51.203
so I'm really, really happy.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.972
{\an1}Thank you--
you very much.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.340
{\an1}Hey!

17:55.407 --> 17:57.509
(all)
Hey!

17:57.576 --> 17:58.844
Hey...

17:58.911 --> 18:02.581
{\an1}Well, we wanted to do things
the right way, you know.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.617
{\an1}This is our new home,
and so...

18:05.684 --> 18:09.788
{\an1}this is not just
a housewarming party.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.925
{\an1}This is our
wedding reception.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.427
(guests cheering)

18:15.494 --> 18:17.196
(glass breaking)

18:18.864 --> 18:19.998
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

18:20.065 --> 18:21.500
{\an8}Probably mad
'cause they got married.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.701
{\an8}I'm gonna be straight up.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.504
{\an7}You feel how the (bleep)
you wanna feel, Pam.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.673
{\an8}I'm mad about it!

18:25.571 --> 18:27.673
{\an7}But don't tell me
how to feel!

18:27.739 --> 18:29.875
{\an7}Why you can't
believe in my dream?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.510
{\an8}You can't do anything
that I ask you to do,

18:31.577 --> 18:32.578
{\an8}and it's pissing me off.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.320
{\an8}♪♪

18:41.386 --> 18:44.122
{\an7}This is not just
a housewarming party.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.725
{\an8}This is our wedding reception.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.628
(guests cheering)

18:49.695 --> 18:51.096
(glass shatters)

18:51.163 --> 18:52.564
Ohh...

18:52.631 --> 18:54.032
{\an1}We went out
and got married.

18:54.099 --> 18:57.002
(Lyrica A.)
We're married!

18:57.069 --> 18:58.303
(cheering)

19:01.773 --> 19:03.442
This was a low blow.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.677
I don't know that I could
ever get past this.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.847
Lyrica knew that me not being
at her wedding

19:08.914 --> 19:10.315
would break my heart,

19:10.382 --> 19:13.252
and I know this
was A1's doing.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.854
(guests cheering)

19:17.322 --> 19:18.924
Is that a cake?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.760
{\an1}Mom, you said you didn't
want us shacking up,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.762
so we did it the right way.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.565
No, you did it
the wrong way.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.500
How could you do
something like this?

19:28.567 --> 19:29.635
Well, it's about us.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.837
(Lyrica G.)
The daughter that I know

19:31.904 --> 19:33.472
wouldn't have done
something like that.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.674
{\an8}Lyrica has always been sweet

19:35.741 --> 19:38.210
{\an8}and very considerate
of my feelings.

19:38.277 --> 19:41.380
Even if she had not
invited me there,

19:41.446 --> 19:43.982
I think I could have dealt
with that better

19:44.049 --> 19:45.884
than just not knowing at all.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.053
I cannot believe
you did this to me.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.254
I really cannot.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.489
{\an1}(A1)
It's-- it's--

19:50.556 --> 19:52.424
A1, how could you have
my only child go

19:52.491 --> 19:55.594
and marry you and I don't
be a part of the planning?

19:55.661 --> 19:57.396
{\an8}You probably mad 'cause
they got married.

19:57.462 --> 19:58.697
{\an8}I'm gonna be straight up.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.065
(Lyrica G.)
You stay out of it, Pam!

20:00.132 --> 20:01.366
{\an5}No, hey, hey...

20:00.132 --> 20:01.366
When it comes to her,

20:01.433 --> 20:02.901
{\an5}you talk to him,
but not my baby.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.901
Yo, yo, hey...

20:02.968 --> 20:03.902
(Pam)
She my daughter now.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.137
(overlapping shouting)

20:05.203 --> 20:06.939
Hell, I'm surprised
just like you are!

20:07.005 --> 20:08.273
Hell, I'm just now
finding out.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.609
{\an1}You feel how the (bleep)
you wanna feel, Pam.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.678
{\an5}That's what I'm doing.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.678
{\an1}You feel how you
wanna feel!

20:12.744 --> 20:14.580
{\an5}I'm not mad about it.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.580
{\an1}But don't tell me
how to feel!

20:15.847 --> 20:17.883
{\an8}(A1)
I think Lyrica's mom,

20:17.950 --> 20:19.318
to be honest,

20:19.384 --> 20:21.186
I feel like
she a little jealous.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.155
I took a stand as a man,

20:23.221 --> 20:27.259
{\an8}and I didn't let nobody get in
the way of what I wanted to do.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.561
{\an5}(Lyrica G.)
Nobody in this room
can understand,

20:29.628 --> 20:32.497
your only child,
that I've waited and planned

20:32.564 --> 20:35.734
years and years to be a part
of her getting married,

20:35.801 --> 20:38.103
she go off and elope and I
don't know anything about it?

20:38.170 --> 20:39.304
Y'all think that's cool?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.006
{\an1}We grown.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.307
{\an8}I feel so bad for Lyrica,

20:42.374 --> 20:44.242
{\an8}I mean, this is supposed to be
her special day,

20:44.309 --> 20:46.011
{\an8}and her mom just ruined it.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.046
You know what? I'm gonna
get the (bleep) out of here.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.414
{\an5}(Pam)
Good, 'cause you
can't do nothing, man.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.383
{\an5}I'm gonna go.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.383
{\an1}Come on,
everybody else happy.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.451
Y'all happy?

20:52.517 --> 20:53.485
(bleeps) that (bleep)!

20:53.552 --> 20:54.686
{\an6}Hell, yeah!

20:53.552 --> 20:54.686
All right, then.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.687
{\an5}All right, then.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.687
Straight up.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.955
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

20:57.022 --> 20:59.191
Get mad at her!
'Cause I'm tired of it.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.393
(Lyrica A.)
This is a lose-lose situation.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.295
If we would have sat
our moms down to dinner

21:03.362 --> 21:04.663
to tell 'em that we eloped,

21:04.730 --> 21:06.832
they would have got
in each other's faces.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.133
You just can't win.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.302
The whole reason
we did it this way

21:10.369 --> 21:13.639
is because of how they act
when they're together, and look,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.240
the way she's
acting right now.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.742
That's exactly why
we didn't want to do it

21:16.808 --> 21:17.843
with you guys there.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.445
♪♪

21:29.054 --> 21:30.622
{\an1}(Princess)
Where are we going?

21:30.689 --> 21:32.958
{\an5}We about to hit the gym,
but I'm about to make
a detour real quick.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.860
{\an1}The gym is right up
the street from the house.

21:34.926 --> 21:36.561

Damn.

Can I get some coffee?
Can I get--

21:42.834 --> 21:44.236
{\an5}No, you can't.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.236
Can I get an espresso?

{\an1}You can't, we can't
do nothing you wanna do

{\an8}I know Princess is mad at me
for missing the cake tasting,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.961
{\an8}but I did something
very special for her,

22:10.028 --> 22:12.397
{\an8}her and I'm gonna show the world
we are gonna connect

22:12.464 --> 22:15.267
after she sees this,
and I hope that she sees

22:15.333 --> 22:18.770
that I'm always
coming from love.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.272
{\an5}I'm just...

22:18.837 --> 22:20.272
{\an1}Actually,
you know what?

22:20.338 --> 22:21.707
We're not having cake.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.108
That hurts my feelings.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.609
{\an8}We're gonna have
gummi bears and--

22:24.676 --> 22:27.579
{\an7}and French toast
and syrup and candy.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.847
{\an8}We're not having no cake.

22:28.914 --> 22:29.915
Are you out of your mind?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.918
{\an6}Listen--

22:31.083 --> 22:32.918
I just solved the problem.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.387
No. I got something that's gonna
solve the problem, all right?

22:35.454 --> 22:39.357
When Princess sees my gesture of
love, she's gonna be speechless.

22:39.424 --> 22:40.892
This is gonna
connect the dots

22:40.959 --> 22:43.228
like it has never
connected before.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.330
Ray J is coming home, baby.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.366
Look up, baby.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.669
{\an1}Huh?

22:52.671 --> 22:55.173
When he's supposed to be
helping me plan a wedding,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.808
he's busy with Scoot-E Bikes.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.145
When I ask him for help,
he's planning a billboard.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.915
And then to make it up to me,
he puts me on the billboard.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.550
{\an5}Hold on, hold on, baby.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.550
What is wrong with you?

23:05.617 --> 23:07.152
{\an1}What you mean,
what's wrong with me?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.487
Nothing's wrong with me.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.757
What is that?

23:11.823 --> 23:12.958
{\an1}(grunting)
Baby, I just need you

23:13.024 --> 23:14.392
{\an1}to get one picture of me
on the Scoot-E Bike.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.594
{\an5}I'm not taking no pictures.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.594
{\an1}No, baby.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.162
{\an1}I need you
to get one picture.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.964
{\an1}I've taken all the pictures
that I needed to take for you.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.500
{\an1}Stop, like, why you can't
believe in my dream?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.034
You can't do anything
that I ask you to do,

23:23.101 --> 23:24.703
and it's pissing me off,
and it's making me mad,

23:24.770 --> 23:26.304
and it's frustrating me.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.240
I feel like kicking the (bleep)
out that Scoot-E Bike right now.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.308
Like, damn, I can't
do nothing right!

23:30.375 --> 23:33.779
I did this big-ass billboard
on Hollywood Boulevard

23:33.845 --> 23:37.015
to showcase that me and Princess
are as solid as ever,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.084
and the Scoot-E Bikes
are taking over the world,

23:39.151 --> 23:40.919
and here we are
together, baby.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.420
Right there!

23:42.487 --> 23:44.022
{\an1}It reminds me of the day
you promised me you were gonna

23:44.089 --> 23:46.124
make every meeting,
you were gonna be there

23:46.191 --> 23:48.994
with me 50%, and now
you're complaining.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.029
{\an5}That don't look like money?

23:49.060 --> 23:51.029
You're acting like I'm wrong.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.531
{\an1}That looks
like money to me.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.865
{\an6}What money?

23:52.597 --> 23:53.865
That looks like--

23:53.932 --> 23:55.901
{\an1}I didn't get no money
for being on that billboard.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.569
I got you, though.

23:57.636 --> 23:58.804
You know what
I want you to do?

23:58.870 --> 24:00.872
I want you to have me
in this wedding.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.275
{\an4}Take my picture
in front of this damn
Scoot-E Bike real quick,

24:03.341 --> 24:06.578
{\an1}so I can get fly,
you know what I'm saying?

24:06.645 --> 24:09.347
Princess, for real.
Like, take the pic--

24:09.414 --> 24:10.982
{\an1}Hey! Yo!

24:11.049 --> 24:12.651
{\an1}Prinky!
Prinky!

24:21.026 --> 24:22.360
{\an8}I can't take it.

24:22.427 --> 24:25.764
{\an7}And I want you
to come home for him and me.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.633
{\an7}I will do whatever it takes
to get your trust back.

24:59.397 --> 25:02.500
I cannot believe Max
isn't here.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.371
He has not been home since
he found out what I did,

25:06.438 --> 25:10.542
and then when I go to pay back
a big part of the money,

25:10.609 --> 25:13.078
he's in the studio
with Masika's whack-ass.

But this
has gone too far.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.225
{\an1}He's not been home,

25:27.292 --> 25:28.560

25:28.627 --> 25:31.129
but what do I need

25:33.265 --> 25:35.734
{\an8}I know I messed up, big time,

25:35.800 --> 25:39.371
but I truly miss
my husband so much,

25:39.437 --> 25:42.274
and Brandus misses
his daddy even more.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.645

a family and we stick together.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.531
When B and I
don't get along,

26:06.598 --> 26:08.300
the biggest loser
is Brandus,

26:08.366 --> 26:10.635
and I ain't gonna never
let my son ever be a loser.

26:10.702 --> 26:14.039
So there's no way I would
ever miss his birthday.

we have Miss Nikki Baby!

{\an5}(Nikki)
Tonight is the event at CossaMia
displaying Nude By Nikki.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.550
Rose and I were supposed
to walk in together,

27:32.617 --> 27:34.019
{\an8}but we haven't really
been seeing eye to eye

27:34.085 --> 27:35.854
{\an8}since the whole Safaree
situation happened.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.390
Either way,
business must still go on.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.027
{\an8}(Nikki)
Hey, guys.

27:42.093 --> 27:43.495
{\an1}Hey!

27:43.561 --> 27:46.064
I may have arrived solo,
but I have my girls with me.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.665
I'm blessed--
they've been here for me

27:47.732 --> 27:48.933
the whole time
I've been going through

27:49.000 --> 27:50.568
this crazy-ass
love triangle.

27:50.635 --> 27:52.303
Thank you guys so much
for coming.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.438
Of course, bitch.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.739
First of all,
can--

27:54.806 --> 27:56.307
We need an update.
What happened?

27:56.374 --> 27:58.076
{\an1}Bitch, I--
I basically got caught up.

27:58.143 --> 28:01.980
{\an4}You know, I was in the room
with Rosa, me and her,
we was kissing.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.281
{\an1}And you know,
Safaree walk in,

28:03.348 --> 28:06.551
{\an1}and he seen me and Rosa
kissing, and he's like...

28:06.618 --> 28:08.887
{\an1}First of all, I was like,
"Ooh, he's mad."

28:08.953 --> 28:10.488
I thought he was gonna
get horny or something.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.357
{\an1}(laughing)
But, bitch, he was mad.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.492
{\an1}He started saying, you know,
"I want y'all both."

28:16.161 --> 28:18.329
{\an1}And I said, first off,
"Um," pause, "that's not cool."

28:18.396 --> 28:19.798
{\an1}And I tried to tell 'em
both, like, y'all,

28:19.864 --> 28:21.266
{\an1}this is not about you two,
this is about me.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.635
{\an7}I'm the liar,
I lied to y'all both.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.437
{\an8}They were still kinda
going back and forth.

28:25.503 --> 28:26.871
{\an5}They were arguing?

28:25.503 --> 28:26.871
Yeah, arguing.

28:26.938 --> 28:27.939
I'm upset about
how it happened,

28:28.006 --> 28:29.474
{\an1}but I'm glad
that they both know.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.476
{\an5}(Teairra)
Dating multiple people
is never easy,

28:31.543 --> 28:34.212
{\an8}and I know Nikki didn't want
to hurt Rosa or Safaree,

28:34.279 --> 28:35.580
but now that the cat's
out the bag,

28:35.647 --> 28:37.549
look like Nikki
got some explaining to do.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.184
I don't know who
she wants to be with,

28:39.250 --> 28:42.020
but having two boos is not
the worst problem in the world.

28:42.087 --> 28:46.491
{\an5}(Rosa)
Tonight is the launch
of Nikki's line,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.226
{\an8}and because it's my store,

28:48.293 --> 28:50.929
{\an8}I am not gonna show up
with no arm candy.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.965
Carter is my friend
and my workout partner.

28:54.032 --> 28:55.800
We met through a couple
of mutual friends,

28:55.867 --> 28:57.368
and I've been knowing her
for a long time.

28:57.435 --> 28:58.770
(indistinct chatter)

29:00.839 --> 29:02.173
Awkward.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.541
{\an5}(Nikki)
I think she got
a new girlfriend.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.677
Looks like Rosa's
moved on already.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.245
But that's okay,
I'm not mad.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.481
It was never exclusive
in the beginning anyway,

29:09.547 --> 29:11.249
so I don't even know
why she was tripping on me.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.952
Either way, she may think
that Safaree is a bad look,

29:14.018 --> 29:16.254
but, honey, Rosa's date
is not a catch.

29:16.321 --> 29:18.123
Not as fly
as Miss Nikki Baby, honey.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.924
{\an1}Nobody will ever play me,
so if she--

29:19.991 --> 29:21.926
{\an1}Her bringing a date
was to piss me off, that--

29:21.993 --> 29:23.194
{\an1}that wasn't gonna
piss me off.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.963
Do the bird call,
if you need us.

29:25.029 --> 29:25.964
{\an4}Okay.

29:25.029 --> 29:25.964
Cuckoo!

29:26.030 --> 29:27.832
{\an5}Cuckoo, cuckoo!

29:26.030 --> 29:27.832
(laughter)

29:27.899 --> 29:29.367
{\an1}Hello.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.502
Hi, beautiful.

29:30.568 --> 29:31.836
This is my friend Carter.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.938
{\an5}Nice to meet you.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.938
You look nice tonight.

29:34.005 --> 29:35.840
Oh, thank you, honey.
Are you hitting on me?

29:35.907 --> 29:37.609
{\an5}Am I what?

29:35.907 --> 29:37.609
Are you hitting on me?

29:37.675 --> 29:38.710
No, no.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.078
{\an1}I mean, I am
a desirable woman.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.613
I totally get it.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.681
{\an1}Do you like my titties?
You looking at 'em a lot.

29:43.748 --> 29:46.684
I guess I really hit a nerve
with Miss Nikki Baby,

29:46.751 --> 29:48.453
based on the little jabs
that she's throwing

29:48.520 --> 29:50.021
at my friend Carter.

29:50.088 --> 29:53.091
I can tell that she thinks that
the world revolves around her,

29:53.158 --> 29:55.126
and honey,
it's not like that.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.728
You are no queen here.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.364
Safaree may kiss the ground
that she walks on.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.798
Not me, honey.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.102
I pay my own dinner,
so I am not doing any of that.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.204
{\an1}I guess you my upgrade,
or my replacement?

30:06.271 --> 30:07.539
She doesn't lie,
though.

30:07.605 --> 30:09.908
She doesn't lie
and she doesn't date lame.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.409
Rosa, me and you
(bleep) around.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.044
You know that, you know
what type of bitch I am.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.879
{\an1}You also told me,
we're not together,

30:14.946 --> 30:16.214
{\an1}he also told me
we're not together.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.615
Cool, we're not together.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.284
Now all of us can go (bleep)
whoever the (bleep) we want.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.153
{\an5}You really showed me
a part of your character
that I wasn't expecting.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.888
{\an1}Rosa, me and you were not
in a relationship.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.490
{\an1}What do I owe you
to tell you that, then?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.525
{\an5}Because we were friends.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.525
Okay, we are friends.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.194
{\an1}But you obviously
didn't waste no time,

30:29.260 --> 30:30.662
so you're feelings
are not that hurt.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.564
{\an5}If you're mad and if
you're a little jealous,
that's okay.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.032
{\an1}No, honey,
I don't get jealous.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.401
{\an1}If you feel like I was wrong
and that's the end of the story,

30:36.467 --> 30:38.603
{\an1}then go be happy with her
or somebody else.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.837
I'm not stopping you.

30:39.904 --> 30:41.439
Oh, she'd definitely
be happy with me.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.807
{\an1}That's great,
let her be happy.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.242
This is not about me
being happy with anybody.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.511
{\an1}What I want is to hear
your apology and that's it.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.379
{\an1}I feel like it's actually
starting to become redundant

30:48.446 --> 30:50.114
because I've repeated
myself so many times,

30:50.181 --> 30:51.849
{\an1}I'm getting frustrated
at this point.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.818
I can't hear your apology

30:53.885 --> 30:55.787
because your attitude
is too loud.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.155
{\an1}You will not have to worry,
'cause you not gonna get

30:57.222 --> 30:58.890
{\an1}no more apologies
out of my mouth, promise.

{\an1}So you're saying
I forced her?

37:29.947 --> 37:31.215
...on her own initiative.

37:31.282 --> 37:33.084
I don't believe that
she did this willingly.

37:33.150 --> 37:35.686
{\an1}Why are you trying to make it
seem like that I did that?

37:35.753 --> 37:38.356
It was a mutual agreement.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.024
Initiated by you.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.092
{\an1}No!

37:41.158 --> 37:42.693
(A1)
Of course.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.662
It's all my damn fault.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.497
What, you think,
I kidnapped her?

37:46.564 --> 37:50.368
I don't know why Lyrica's mom
can't just check her attitude

37:50.434 --> 37:54.271
and accept the fact that Lyrica
just made her own decision.

37:54.338 --> 37:57.942
{\an1}I should have had a--
at least the option to come.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.177
{\an1}But we didn't
want nobody involved.

38:00.244 --> 38:03.447
{\an1}We wanted to do what
we wanted to do as a couple.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.683
So you give my daughter
a $2 wedding

38:05.750 --> 38:08.352
after being engaged
for two-and-a-half years.

38:08.419 --> 38:09.620
A $2 wedding?

38:09.687 --> 38:10.621
Yeah, that's a $2 wedding.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.323
The ring cost...

38:12.390 --> 38:14.025
a whole lot.

38:14.091 --> 38:15.326
I'm not talking
about the ring.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.560
{\an4}So...

38:15.393 --> 38:16.560
It could have been bigger,

38:16.627 --> 38:17.795
in my eyes,
but it's what you did.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.798
{\an5}Oh, you crazy.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.798
But A1, again...

38:20.865 --> 38:23.768
my only issue is,
I wasn't there.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.069
This is my only child,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.772
so there
is only one time

38:27.838 --> 38:29.440
for a wedding
for my daughter.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.908
Even if you do it again...

38:30.975 --> 38:32.877
{\an4}I get it.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.877
...she's already married.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.478
{\an3}It's done.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.714
{\an1}It's done, like you
just said, it's done.

38:36.781 --> 38:37.982
You know what?
Can I get the dogs?

38:38.049 --> 38:39.517
I'm tired of going over
this with you.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.685
Where are the dogs?

38:40.751 --> 38:42.987
{\an1}I don't even know.
I think Lyrica took 'em.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.155
Where are the dogs?
I'm going to get my dogs.

38:44.221 --> 38:45.690
{\an1}Oh, no, no, no.
They not even back there.

38:45.756 --> 38:46.924
{\an5}Where are they?

38:45.756 --> 38:46.924
I know what you can have.

38:46.991 --> 38:47.925
What can I have?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.760
You can have this picture.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.062
(glass shatters)

38:51.128 --> 38:52.363
That's what I care
about your picture.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.065
Don't play with me, A1.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.366
{\an1}It's gonna be
a whole lot of more...

38:55.433 --> 38:57.435
And I don't care!
Stop--

38:57.501 --> 38:58.769
{\an1}...photos and memories
that you gonna miss out.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.905
Why are you taunting me?
Why are you doing this?

39:00.971 --> 39:02.573
You can excuse yourself.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.275
{\an5}Well, guess what?

39:02.640 --> 39:04.275
And I'm done.

39:04.341 --> 39:06.911
I'm done, too.
I'm done, I'm done.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.512
{\an4}Not today.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.512
I'm not gonna keep
bickering with you.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.953
(whistling)
Come on, come on.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.222
Good girl. Come on.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.124
Y'all hitting the park
with me today.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.500
{\an8}(announcer)
Next on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

39:29.567 --> 39:31.669
{\an8}(man)
So my girl say she runs
into Safaree and then...

39:31.736 --> 39:33.437
{\an9}What?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.106
{\an8}It all just went down.

39:35.172 --> 39:37.475
{\an7}Nikki's saying she want
to meet up with me tomorrow.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.677
{\an7}Listen, if you need
an ear bud in your ear

39:39.744 --> 39:41.545
{\an7}and you need me to be,
like, watching it...

39:41.612 --> 39:43.080
{\an8}Can we set that up?

39:43.147 --> 39:44.815
{\an8}One of my friends
wanted to meet you again.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.283
{\an8}As long as you with it,
I'm with it.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.318
{\an8}<i>As long as you with it,</i>
<i>I'm with it.</i>

39:47.384 --> 39:49.520
{\an8}'Cause I want it all.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.055
{\an8}Hey, I'm with it.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.624
{\an8}Do you know my girl
over here?

39:53.691 --> 39:55.159
{\an8}Who the hell is this?

39:55.226 --> 39:57.194
{\an8}(woman)
Papi. We wasn't
together in Miami?

39:57.261 --> 39:58.496
{\an8}Bitch, you remember
who I am.

40:00.097 --> 40:02.967
{\an8}I don't even know if
half the people on there
is even gonna come.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.202
{\an8}And then my granny,
she's always sick.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.971
{\an8}She can't travel alone
by herself.

40:07.037 --> 40:08.072
{\an9}She's here.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.040
{\an7}(sobbing)
Granny!

40:11.776 --> 40:13.911
{\an7}It's important for me that
my dad walks me down the aisle.

40:13.978 --> 40:15.312
{\an8}It should be.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.680
{\an8}That's your father.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.916
{\an7}I'm just afraid
that he might say no.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.186
{\an7}I'm finna do something real
special for her, man.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.155
{\an7}I'm finna put a smile
on her face.

40:24.221 --> 40:25.623
{\an8}You know exactly
what you gotta do.

40:25.689 --> 40:26.624
{\an7}Yeah, I know
what I'm gonna do.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.892
{\an7}I'm gonna
do anything it take.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.493
{\an7}I apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.061
{\an7}I've already put myself
in your shoes.

40:31.128 --> 40:32.530
{\an8}I don't wanna be here.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.098
{\an8}I don't wanna
(bleep) be a part

40:34.165 --> 40:35.866
{\an8}of the bull(bleep)
no more.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.435
{\an8}As far as our marriage, I just
feel like it needs to be fixed,

40:38.502 --> 40:41.238
{\an8}and it can't be fixed
together.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.573
{\an8}Girl, let me tell you.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.177
{\an7}This random girl
reaches out to me in my DMs.

40:46.243 --> 40:50.247
{\an7}Lo and behold,
Max Lux had a Becky.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.416
{\an8}"You are cordially invited
to attend a listening party

40:52.483 --> 40:54.218
{\an7}for Moniece Slaughter's
new album."

40:54.285 --> 40:55.486
{\an8}That's a joke.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.955
{\an7}So we're gonna accept
the joke and go.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.124
{\an8}Brandi went looking
for her husband.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.559
{\an8}She attacked Becky.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.027
{\an7}You're a mother(bleep)
joke.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.562
{\an8}You can't sing.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.562
{\an8}I'm sorry that you
feel that way.

41:04.628 --> 41:05.696
{\an8}You can't sing!

41:05.763 --> 41:07.865
{\an8}(crowd gasping)
