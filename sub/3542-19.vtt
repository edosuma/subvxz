00:06.715 --> 00:10.926

tell me you don't feel something for him.

- Nope. We all have a weapon.

He thinks that I have
some unresolved feelings for Damon.

I guess that's why

Not yet. But I'm sure I will soon.
He's expecting me to deliver two stakes.

- That's gonna be disappointing for him.

- Am I wrong?
- It's what you do, Damon.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.708
You sabotage things.

34:49.879 --> 34:55.050
Think about it. Every time
there's a bump in the road, you lash out.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.761
What if I didn't?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.430
What if there was no bump?

35:05.561 --> 35:07.729
I'm sorry, Elena.

35:07.897 --> 35:11.358
But this time I'm not gonna
make it so easy for you.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.611
This time you'll have to figure it out
for yourself.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.416
[ALARIC GROANS]

35:28.584 --> 35:31.795
It's a little gratuitous,
don't you think, Stefan?

35:31.963 --> 35:35.090
- I would have been more gentle.
REBEKAH: I'm gonna take him to the caves.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.634
You're gonna go in
and fetch me the stake.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.929
And if you think you can hide,
you're wrong.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.474
KLAUS:
And then there was one.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.477
I know about your brother's
little mission to Denver.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.564
He failed.
Not that that's news anymore.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.899
So, what are you gonna do now,
Klaus?

35:53.067 --> 35:56.069
- You gonna kill me?
- I haven't actually decided yet.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.071
Oh, sure you have.

35:58.239 --> 36:03.076
See, you've had every chance
and every excuse imaginable to do it.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.828
But yet, you haven't.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.165
- Which means you don't want to.
- You know something, you're right.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.001
See, I'm still waiting for my old friend
to come back.

36:11.627 --> 36:16.089
By the looks of it,
he's just beneath the surface.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.091
Waiting to come out and play.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.676
[CHUCKLES]

36:19.844 --> 36:21.595
Isn't that right, Ripper?

36:23.806 --> 36:26.600
I've been fighting that part of myself...

36:27.351 --> 36:30.770
...thinking that if I repressed it,
it would go away...

36:30.938 --> 36:32.647
...but it won't, heh.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.443
And now that I've accepted it...

36:36.611 --> 36:38.278
...it can't control me.

36:42.116 --> 36:43.867
And neither can you.

36:45.036 --> 36:49.247
So unless you're gonna stake me...

36:50.499 --> 36:52.667
...why don't you get the hell out
of my house?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.274
ROSE:
Are we there yet?

37:18.778 --> 37:20.820
Don't tell them I'm here.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.365
Ah, they had a fight.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.661
I know you wanna stop it.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.996
Protect her from it.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.708
But you're young.
You don't see what I see.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.587
It's not just that she makes him
a better person.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.006
And she does, but...

37:40.174 --> 37:41.675
...he changes her too.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.180
Damon challenges her.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.349
Surprises her.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.726
He makes her question her life.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.020
Her beliefs.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.189
Stefan is different.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.609
His love is pure.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.112
He'll always be good for her.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.031
Damon is either the best thing for her...

38:05.199 --> 38:06.366
...or the worst.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.094
My mom said you can stay
as long as you want.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.972
- Did she say we could share the bed?
- No.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.890
She said you could sleep
on the couch.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.310
- Mm.
- At least until we figure out...

38:33.477 --> 38:35.645
...what Damon and Stefan
find out about Klaus.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.065
And if Klaus didn't create their line?

38:39.233 --> 38:41.276
And they try to kill him?

38:41.944 --> 38:44.863
Tyler, I just got you back.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.289
I'm not losing you again.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.516
- Klaus drew this for you?
CAROLINE: Huh?

39:13.684 --> 39:16.811
- That's pretty creepy.
- Heh.

39:16.979 --> 39:21.608
Yeah, Klaus is pretty creepy,
even when he's trying to be charming.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.151
Charming?

39:24.028 --> 39:26.363
- Does Klaus have a thing for you?
- No.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.947
As far as I'm concerned...

39:28.115 --> 39:31.034
...he isn't capable of real feelings.
- I'm serious.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.287
- What happened while I was gone?
- Tyler.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.289
Nothing.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.791
Nothing happened.

39:37.958 --> 39:41.336
- Then why'd you keep this?
- I don't know.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.722
I think I'm gonna find someplace else
to spend the night.

39:54.141 --> 39:57.936

40:36.267 --> 40:41.855
Now, why would I give you the one thing
that requires everyone to keep me alive?

40:42.356 --> 40:44.232
Are we bargaining now?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.234
Fine.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.947
- What's your offer?
- There's only one stake out there.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.741
Which means only one Original
has to die.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.579
Help me...

40:57.997 --> 41:00.039
...and I'll make sure it's not you.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.542
Tenuous, but points for effort.

41:03.210 --> 41:07.213
You see, I don't want one Original
to die.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.391
- I want them all to die.
- How the hell did you do that?

41:18.559 --> 41:23.438
It was easy to fool Niklaus, but I thought
you of all people would understand.

41:25.441 --> 41:29.110
After all, my son did use your body
at one point.
