00:01.332 --> 00:02.599
Aah! Ow!

00:02.652 --> 00:06.082
Wh... why are you killing me?!

00:08.577 --> 00:10.546
Mr. Pickles.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.949
You are a bad dog...

00:14.083 --> 00:16.853
A very bad dog.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.855
I want you to have dog sex to me!

00:18.888 --> 00:21.223
Give it to me, Mr. Pickles!

00:21.257 --> 00:23.726
Give it to me!

00:23.758 --> 00:26.061
Pickles!

00:26.095 --> 00:27.564
Mr. Pickles!

Vegans

00:49.417 --> 00:52.387
Who wants some
bacon and eggs with cheese?

00:52.420 --> 00:53.589
Smells yummy!

00:53.623 --> 00:55.258
Doesn't it, Mr. Pickles?

00:55.291 --> 00:56.926
Mr. Pickles? I'm over here.

00:56.959 --> 00:58.495
- What?
- Mr. Pickles?

00:58.527 --> 01:00.394
Mmm, I don't know how you do it.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.198
Oh, you're just saying that.

01:02.231 --> 01:04.048
- Hello.
- Oh?

01:04.167 --> 01:06.069
I'm going to need you
to close the window

01:06.101 --> 01:08.104
when you cook meat or dairy.

01:08.137 --> 01:09.105
Huh?

01:09.139 --> 01:12.007
I'm vegan, you see.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.744
Vay-gan? What's that?

01:13.777 --> 01:14.745
Vee-gan.

01:14.777 --> 01:17.446
It promotes compassion for animals.

01:17.479 --> 01:19.215
Oh, I love animals.

01:19.248 --> 01:21.417
Oh, don't I, Mr. Pickles.

01:21.450 --> 01:23.753
Mr. Pickles,
you're supposed to be my dog.

01:23.786 --> 01:25.121
Stay with me!

01:25.155 --> 01:29.459
Maybe you should
try being a vegan, hm?

01:29.491 --> 01:31.227
I'm open to new ideas.

01:31.261 --> 01:34.931
Then you're invited to
the vegan headquarters.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.032
I'll send you a limo.

01:36.065 --> 01:37.768
- Uh...
- See you there.

01:37.801 --> 01:39.736
Hmm.

01:47.610 --> 01:48.812
Oh.

01:48.845 --> 01:50.480
Ahh. You made it.

01:50.512 --> 01:52.615
I'm excited to be vir-gan.

01:52.649 --> 01:54.718
Vegan. What's in the bag?

01:54.750 --> 01:56.986
Oh, I brought a ham and
cheese sandwich for lunch.

01:57.020 --> 02:00.322
Orinduthias says I have to
take this to the dungeon.

02:00.355 --> 02:03.921
- Who?
- He'll change your life.

02:09.966 --> 02:10.967
Shh!

02:11.000 --> 02:12.169
He's coming.

02:12.202 --> 02:13.836
- V!
- Who?

02:13.870 --> 02:16.840
Orinduthias!

02:23.179 --> 02:26.616
Or as the ancient vegans used to say...

02:26.649 --> 02:27.616
hi.

02:27.650 --> 02:30.821
We are here because we are...

02:30.853 --> 02:31.922
Vegan!

02:31.954 --> 02:32.955
Vegetarian.

02:32.989 --> 02:33.956
I mean, vegan!

02:33.990 --> 02:35.292
Because we...

02:35.324 --> 02:36.592
Care about the animals.

02:36.626 --> 02:38.461
Because we were on the e-mail list...

02:38.494 --> 02:40.430
I-I mean, because we care about animals.

02:40.462 --> 02:43.934
And we can help others become vegans...

02:43.966 --> 02:45.134
- Also!
- Too!

02:45.168 --> 02:46.136
I mean, also.

02:49.172 --> 02:50.206
Feast!

02:54.244 --> 02:55.878
Oh, and try this.

02:55.912 --> 02:57.347
Divine root.

02:57.379 --> 02:59.014
It just looks like carrots.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.217
It is.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.452
Is everybody enjoying the feast?

03:02.484 --> 03:03.853
It's kind of boring.

03:04.853 --> 03:06.655
This vay-gan food isn't bad.

03:06.688 --> 03:07.791
Vee-gan.

03:07.823 --> 03:09.158
But it would be better

03:09.192 --> 03:10.193
with meat and cheese on it.

03:11.227 --> 03:12.329
We can do that?!

03:12.361 --> 03:13.864
We can't do that!

03:13.896 --> 03:18.200
I mean, maybe sometimes
we're tempted to eat anim...

03:18.234 --> 03:19.502
- 46 Crest Road.
- What are you doing?

03:19.535 --> 03:22.204
Thanks. Oh, I just ordered a pizza.

03:22.238 --> 03:23.573
We can do that?!

03:23.605 --> 03:25.809
We can't! We are vegan!

03:25.841 --> 03:27.843
- I'm a vay-jan, too.
- Vee-gan!

03:27.877 --> 03:30.313
That's why I ordered
my pizza half vee-jin

03:30.346 --> 03:31.548
and half meat and cheese.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.316
You're just not getting it.

03:33.348 --> 03:37.152
You need to see the film.

03:37.186 --> 03:38.688
Ooh, I love film.

03:38.721 --> 03:41.091
This is really going
to change your life.

03:41.123 --> 03:42.859
That film's so scary.

03:45.428 --> 03:47.264
So, what's for lunch?

03:47.297 --> 03:48.831
I thought you were making lunch.

03:48.865 --> 03:51.902
Me? Tommy, uh, what do you like to cook?

03:51.935 --> 03:53.169
I'm 6.

03:53.202 --> 03:55.405
- Hmm.
- Oh, I wish Mom was here.

03:55.437 --> 03:56.940
She'd make us lunch.

03:56.972 --> 03:59.275
Hmm.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.389
Mr. Pickles!

04:13.423 --> 04:14.958
Stay with me!

04:16.426 --> 04:17.560
Vegan.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.430
Now you must watch the film.

04:21.463 --> 04:24.300
This is really going
to change your life.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.901
Ooh, exciting.

04:25.934 --> 04:29.371
The following is
footage from a real farm.

04:29.405 --> 04:32.241
- Farm, farm, farm.
- Jim, I'm a non-vagan.

04:32.275 --> 04:33.476
Me too, Fred.

04:33.508 --> 04:36.312
That means the animals have to suffer.

04:36.345 --> 04:37.446
Ow!

04:37.479 --> 04:38.948
No, please.

04:38.982 --> 04:40.282
Stop killing me.

04:41.484 --> 04:43.386
Ah! Oh, no! Don't make me suffer!

04:43.419 --> 04:45.722
- Ha ha!
- Please, don't chew my face off!

04:45.755 --> 04:47.624
- Ha ha.
- Stop torturing me!

04:47.657 --> 04:49.659
Life sucks making milk all day,

04:49.691 --> 04:52.294
but at least you've
never slaughtered me.

04:52.328 --> 04:53.662
Ow!

04:53.696 --> 04:55.998
Why are you running over
me with your convertible?

04:56.032 --> 04:58.401
Stop it. I've had enough.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.904
Horrific, I know.

05:00.936 --> 05:04.473
Yes. There are much nicer
ways to kill animals.

05:04.506 --> 05:05.607
What?!

05:05.640 --> 05:08.611
It's never okay to kill animals!

05:08.643 --> 05:10.312
But how would you get meat?

05:10.345 --> 05:14.283
You can't eat meat
and dairy and be a vegan!

05:14.316 --> 05:16.018
Maybe I can!

05:16.051 --> 05:17.287
- Oh!
- No!

05:17.320 --> 05:18.788
They're two different things!

05:18.821 --> 05:21.825
So are knitting and sewing,
but I can do both.

05:21.857 --> 05:25.194
Enough! Send her to the dungeon!

05:25.227 --> 05:28.465
Orinduthias,
I'm really enjoying being va-jan.

05:28.498 --> 05:30.767
Vee-gan!

05:30.799 --> 05:33.203
Uh, I think you're burning it.

05:33.236 --> 05:34.771
I like the black parts.

05:34.804 --> 05:36.306
How's the garlic bread coming?

05:36.338 --> 05:37.606
Almost ready.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.842
Uh, can we just go get Mom?

05:39.876 --> 05:42.178
Oh, we don't need
your mother to cook us lun...

05:42.210 --> 05:44.480
Quick, everybody get in the fridge!

05:55.090 --> 05:58.027
Mr. Pickles!

05:58.061 --> 06:01.498
I said stay with me!

06:01.530 --> 06:05.035
Now you will be locked in
this cage so you can see

06:05.068 --> 06:08.071
what it's like to be a helpless animal.

06:08.104 --> 06:10.039
This is really gonna change your life.

06:10.073 --> 06:11.174
Ooh! Fun.

06:12.275 --> 06:13.410
Lock her in!

06:13.443 --> 06:15.044
Time for my hummus bath.

06:15.078 --> 06:17.347
I can't get it to lock.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.681
- Oh, here.
- Huh?

06:18.713 --> 06:20.349
How are you so strong?

06:20.383 --> 06:21.684
See my lunch over there?

06:21.717 --> 06:22.986
Bring it to me.

06:23.018 --> 06:24.686
Uh, okay.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.856
You just need more protein.

06:26.888 --> 06:28.023
Protein?!

06:28.056 --> 06:29.025
That's just a myth!

06:29.058 --> 06:30.693
It does smell good, though.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.561
What's taking so lo...

06:32.595 --> 06:33.662
What?!

06:33.696 --> 06:35.364
- No!
- Sorry... Thank you.

06:35.398 --> 06:36.933
Gee, it's just a sandwich.

06:36.965 --> 06:41.037
First you tell everybody to put
meat and cheese on vegan food,

06:41.070 --> 06:42.939
then you order a pizza!

06:42.972 --> 06:44.907
You missed the point of the film,

06:44.941 --> 06:47.710
and now you nearly corrupted
a level-eight vegan!

06:47.743 --> 06:49.012
No!

06:49.044 --> 06:50.780
Want some of this vray-gan sandwich?

06:50.813 --> 06:51.881
Aaaah!

06:51.914 --> 06:54.616
We're going to have
to perform a ceremony

06:54.650 --> 06:57.554
from the times of the ancient vegans,

06:57.587 --> 07:00.457
hundreds and hundreds of months ago.

07:00.489 --> 07:02.958
Ooh, I love ceremonies.

07:04.826 --> 07:07.729
Vegan!

07:07.763 --> 07:09.399
Well, this looks like the place.

07:09.431 --> 07:10.400
Yay!

07:10.433 --> 07:11.568
Mom's gonna make us lunch.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.102
Finally.

07:13.136 --> 07:16.606
Hello, I need to pick up my
wife so she can make us lunch.

07:16.638 --> 07:18.240
Are you vegan?

07:18.273 --> 07:19.875
No, I'm Sagittarius.

07:19.909 --> 07:22.712
Why don't you go to that
new diner down the street,

07:22.744 --> 07:25.581
you meat-chugging,
dairy guzzling bastards!

07:25.614 --> 07:26.583
Diner?

07:26.616 --> 07:27.650
- Great!
- Yay!

07:27.683 --> 07:28.785
Let's go, go, go!

07:28.818 --> 07:31.087
Mr. Pickles, stay with me!

07:31.987 --> 07:34.590
- Yay!
- I'm so hungry! Come on!

07:34.623 --> 07:37.926
I'm so much better than them

07:50.273 --> 07:52.308
Vegan!

07:55.645 --> 07:57.614
Vegan!

07:57.647 --> 07:59.616
Oh! Oops.

08:01.616 --> 08:04.287
Vegan!

08:11.393 --> 08:12.961
Sorry!

08:12.994 --> 08:17.199
We are gathered here because we share...

08:17.232 --> 08:18.667
Superior beliefs.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.802
Parking spaces. Oops! Sorry.

08:20.835 --> 08:24.640
And some people don't respect those...

08:24.674 --> 08:25.808
- Beliefs!
- Parking spaces.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.776
Guys, what's going on?

08:27.809 --> 08:29.645
And maybe there's...

08:29.679 --> 08:33.049
No way to change their ignorant mind.

08:33.082 --> 08:33.982
Outfit!

08:34.015 --> 08:37.120
And maybe those minds must be...

08:37.153 --> 08:39.022
Ve-stroyed!

08:39.054 --> 08:40.556
- Killed!
- Guys?

08:40.589 --> 08:44.560
Raise your eco-friendly
animal-product-free hammers!

08:44.593 --> 08:49.198
And bleed the ignorance
from the unchangeable!

08:49.232 --> 08:50.666
All hail vegan!

08:50.699 --> 08:53.203
Is this the way-gan ceremony?

08:53.236 --> 08:55.071
Am I missing it?

08:56.871 --> 08:58.040
Hey!

08:58.073 --> 09:00.709
Did somebody order a vegan pizza?

09:00.742 --> 09:03.879
Oh, that's mine,
but I ordered half va-jan,

09:03.913 --> 09:05.248
half meat and cheese.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.348
What? No.

09:06.381 --> 09:07.916
Whoops! This is all meat and cheese!

09:07.949 --> 09:09.184
Guess this one's free.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.852
Is that real meat on there?

09:10.886 --> 09:12.387
- Yeah, dude.
- Oh, thanks.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.890
It smells so good.

09:13.923 --> 09:16.392
- That smells like real cheese!
- I want a slice!

09:16.424 --> 09:17.693
Stop it!

09:17.727 --> 09:19.929
We are vay-gans... vee-gans.

09:19.962 --> 09:22.598
I can't take it anymore!

09:22.631 --> 09:23.866
Give that to me.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.368
No, it's mine!

09:25.400 --> 09:26.401
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:26.434 --> 09:28.203
No, it's mine, back off!

09:28.236 --> 09:30.707
You, too, you filthy animal.

09:40.549 --> 09:44.020
No, please. Stop killing me!

09:44.053 --> 09:47.557
- Don't make me suffer!
- Please don't chew my face off!

09:47.589 --> 09:49.291
Stop torturing me!

09:49.324 --> 09:51.526
Really? You're making the pizza guy

09:51.559 --> 09:53.563
watch the vu-gan film?

09:53.596 --> 09:55.732
Don't forget about me!

09:56.999 --> 10:00.203
You animal! You will pay for this!

10:00.236 --> 10:02.038
He said the pizza was free.

10:02.070 --> 10:02.971
You!

10:03.005 --> 10:05.775
Shut your mouth, you stupid c...

10:07.242 --> 10:09.145
I want some pizza.

10:09.178 --> 10:10.246
Give it to me!

10:10.279 --> 10:12.649
Give it to me!

10:12.682 --> 10:14.250
Hello?

10:15.617 --> 10:17.919
Where are you taking me?

10:17.953 --> 10:19.756
I've had enough of this.

10:19.789 --> 10:21.723
I'm the one who ordered the pizza.

10:21.756 --> 10:22.824
Huh?

10:22.857 --> 10:24.260
What are you doing here?

10:25.328 --> 10:27.829
Aww, you just wanted a belly rub.

10:31.701 --> 10:33.403
Hi, everybody.

10:34.837 --> 10:36.271
There you are, Mr. Pickles!

10:36.304 --> 10:39.174
See what happens when
you don't stay with me?

10:39.208 --> 10:41.477
I get in all kinds of trouble.

10:41.510 --> 10:42.779
