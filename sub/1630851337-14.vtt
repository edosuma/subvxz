playoffs are already here.

I feel like this season's
going by so fast.

So fast.
I know,
the blinds, the battles,

00:12.220 --> 00:13.680
the knockouts --
everything was incredible,

00:13.720 --> 00:15.180
but I'm having a hard time
remembering everything.

Yeah,
if only there were a show

I am Carson Daly.
Big show.

Tonight, we're gonna recap
what an incredible Season 21

00:34.280 --> 00:35.860
we have had up to this point,

00:35.910 --> 00:41.240
including welcoming our
brand-new coach, Ariana Grande,

00:41.290 --> 00:45.710
and our big celebration
of our 500th episode.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.290
Let's kick off the night
by taking a closer look

00:48.340 --> 00:50.340
at how quickly Ariana settled in

00:50.380 --> 00:52.800
and held her own
against other coaches.

for Ariana to show up?

00:57.760 --> 00:59.260
Yes, I'm excited.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.180
Remember when you showed up
when you were on a school bus?

01:01.220 --> 01:04.270
Yeah. And then Nick
comes in on a parachute.

01:04.310 --> 01:05.310
And then he gets
on a motorcycle.

01:05.350 --> 01:06.730
That was pretty impressive.

01:06.770 --> 01:09.400
Ariana is a huge,
huge superstar.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.480
She's probably gonna come in
on like a jetpack

01:11.520 --> 01:14.990
or a hovercraft or hanging from
a helicopter or something.

01:15.030 --> 01:16.320

would be impressive.

or something.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.900
I love Ryleigh.

08:53.190 --> 08:56.820
* Fire in my lungs, can't bite
the devil on my tongue *

08:56.870 --> 08:58.240
* You know *

08:58.280 --> 09:01.160
* I don't need to be loved
by yoooou *

09:01.200 --> 09:03.290
Ariana: Aside from having one of
the best voices on the show,

09:03.330 --> 09:06.250
Ryleigh just has this
unbelievable energy

09:06.290 --> 09:07.580
and stage presence.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.920
She has been such
a consistent showstopper.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.300
Daly: Ariana's next artist
is a 23-year-old soul singer.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.970
My name is Raquel Trinidad.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.930
I'm definitely a free spirit,
and I actually moved to Miami

09:17.970 --> 09:20.100
to try to pursue
my music career.

09:20.140 --> 09:24.600
* I wish those days
could come back once more *

09:24.640 --> 09:26.850
* Why did those days *

09:26.900 --> 09:30.320
Ariana: Raquel is my soulful
disco pop diva.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.150
When you go for
the higher options,

09:32.190 --> 09:34.610
just trust them and support them
because they're so there.

09:34.650 --> 09:37.410
They feel very free and not
planned as well, which I like.

09:37.450 --> 09:41.330
Her voice is like a time
machine. It can go anywhere.

09:41.370 --> 09:45.080
* Well, sometimes I go out
by myself *

09:45.120 --> 09:47.830
* And I look across the water *

09:47.870 --> 09:49.920
You can really tell
that you connect.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.380
You're just feeling the song
and just going for it.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.050
* In my head
I paint a picture *

09:54.090 --> 09:56.970
I think Raquel might be
a contender to win this.

09:57.010 --> 09:59.220
I think she was
really captivating.

09:59.260 --> 10:04.640
* Why don't you come on over,
Valerie? *

10:04.680 --> 10:08.270
Team Ariana!
[ Laughs ] Whoo!

10:08.310 --> 10:10.810
Daly: Rounding out the team
is Holly Forbes,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.980
who's finally ready
to take center stage.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.110
Holly: Around 11,
I started having seizures.

10:15.150 --> 10:20.120
The doctors put me on medication
and I ended up losing my hair.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.620
"The Voice"
boosted my confidence.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.290
It's so focused
on how you sound.

10:25.330 --> 10:28.620
That's a big thing because
I have a very unique look

10:28.670 --> 10:30.460
and a very unique voice.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.000
* No, no, no, no *

10:33.040 --> 10:34.750
* I'm a rocket man *

10:34.800 --> 10:37.170
Daly: Ariana used her only block
on John

10:37.220 --> 10:39.380
after Holly
received a four-chair turn

10:39.430 --> 10:41.300
during her blind audition.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.560
I have been waiting a very
long time to use my block.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.640
My daughter's watching and she's
like the biggest fan of you.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.560
Her her name's Violet.
Oh, my God.
Violet, love you.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.360
Daly: But it backfired when
Holly went with Coach Kelly.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.940
I love you!

10:54.980 --> 10:57.900
Ariana: I used my block on John,
but in hindsight,

10:57.940 --> 11:00.410
I really wish
I'd use it on Kelly Clarkson.

11:00.450 --> 11:04.870
* Don't you remember you told me
you loved me? *

11:04.910 --> 11:07.540
Daly: Then when John tried to
steal Holly in the knockouts,

11:07.580 --> 11:09.290
Ariana got her revenge.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.040
Whoa! Drama!

11:11.080 --> 11:13.630
We got drama!
Hello.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.130
We meet again.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.880
Man, John and Ariana ended up
both fighting for Holly,

11:16.920 --> 11:20.180
which made me feel good because
I wanted her to feel that love.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.720
I really love you.
I'm gonna go with Ari.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.220
Are you serious?

11:24.260 --> 11:26.970
Good things definitely
come to those who wait.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.730
And I'm just so grateful
that she finally found

11:28.770 --> 11:30.270
her way to Team Ariana.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.850
I am so excited.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.560
This is such
an exciting moment.
Me too.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.940
I'm not letting go.
No.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.490
My team is so eclectic
and amazing and diverse,

11:38.530 --> 11:40.950
but I think the common theme
is just

11:40.990 --> 11:43.910
overwhelming powerhouse
vocalists,

11:43.950 --> 11:46.990
and there's just so much love
and so much soul.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.870
This might be my first
live playoff team,

11:48.910 --> 11:50.660
but do not underestimate us.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.420
We are here to win.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.170
Daly: Team Ariana is ready
for the live playoffs,

11:55.210 --> 11:56.750
but there's a coach
on the horizon

11:56.800 --> 11:59.090
who's not going down
without a fight.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.090
John:
I've won "The Voice" before.

12:01.130 --> 12:05.350
I won it my very first season,
and I miss that feeling.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.930
I want to win again.
Let's go.

12:09.930 --> 12:10.930
John.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.440
Team Legend.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.310
John is very competitive,

12:14.350 --> 12:17.110
and he kind of masks it
with this charm.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.900
Like in Pokémon when I put
the raspberries out

12:19.940 --> 12:21.650
to get the Pokémon
to come to them.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.320
[ Cheers and applause ]

12:25.370 --> 12:27.280
And then he stabs you
in the back.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.490
Shake it up!
Shock the world!

12:29.540 --> 12:32.080
This is
reverse psychology.
[ Laughs ]

12:32.120 --> 12:34.870
Blake: He won "The Voice"
his first season.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.290
It's been a long dry spell
since then

12:37.340 --> 12:40.760
and I think he's turning up
the competitiveness.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.720
Like Blake,
country music is my life.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.840
And he's given out robes.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.430
We're pulling out gifts.
Whoo! Oh, snap!

12:48.470 --> 12:50.310
Team Legend.
Oh, it's a -- it's a --

12:50.350 --> 12:53.520
I'd even sing for you.
* Welcome to Team Legend *

12:53.560 --> 12:55.600
I'm sittin' right next to him,
y'all, okay?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.190
He is competitive.

12:57.230 --> 12:59.650
I turned
very early for you.

12:59.690 --> 13:01.320
What? What do you mean
"very early"?

13:01.360 --> 13:03.070
What does that --
We both turned.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.860
I would argue that I turned
right before Kelly.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.740
It was close.
Like a millisecond, maybe.

13:07.780 --> 13:12.330
You can't go wrong either way,
but you can go more right.

13:12.370 --> 13:13.290
[ Laughter ]

13:13.330 --> 13:14.750
He does not come here to lose.

13:14.790 --> 13:17.330
* You made your choice *
Whoo!

13:17.380 --> 13:19.840
* Now let's go
and win "The Voice" *

13:19.880 --> 13:23.300
John, I know your trick.
What do I do?

13:23.340 --> 13:24.840
How you get them?
Last word?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.640
Last word.
And then steals the advice
you just gave?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.800
[ Laughter ]

13:29.850 --> 13:32.850
Whoo!

13:32.890 --> 13:35.100
I'm a loud talker.
I'm a loud singer.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.190
And when I'm enthusiastic...
Turn it up!

13:37.230 --> 13:39.110
...I'm not afraid to show it.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.860
Paris!
John.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.030
Oh, my goodness!
He's yelling.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.320
Blake:
You always know when John

13:44.360 --> 13:47.610
is truly enthusiastic
about an artist.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.200
Hello! Talk to us!

13:49.240 --> 13:54.750
Because his volume level
goes from 6 to 10 instantly.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.040
He talks so damn loud.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.540
I do it because
Blake can't hear.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.170
That's true.
A'ight.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.630
I do the same for my
father-in-law who's in his 80s.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.590
[ Laughter ]

14:05.630 --> 14:08.050
Oh, my gosh, when John
gets really enthusiastic,

14:08.090 --> 14:11.550
he is full body
and he does this thing.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.270
Yes!

14:15.310 --> 14:18.270
Whoo!
It's like a train.

14:18.310 --> 14:20.400
It's like a, "chugga, chugga,
chugga, choo."

14:20.440 --> 14:22.320
Yes!

14:22.360 --> 14:23.900
[ Laughing ] It's amazing.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.280
Welcome!

14:27.900 --> 14:28.910
Huh?

14:28.950 --> 14:31.320
Yes!

14:31.370 --> 14:32.620
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear the question.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.160
I think I'm deaf in this ear
from John.

14:40.290 --> 14:41.750
* This is "The Voice" *

14:41.790 --> 14:43.750
Daly: Welcome back to
"The Road to the Live Shows"

14:43.800 --> 14:45.090
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.470
Now this season,
Coach John Legend proved

14:47.510 --> 14:50.340
that he was hungry
for another "Voice" victory.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.890
Let's bring back
an old favorite!

14:51.930 --> 14:54.350
This is one of my best teams,
and I truly believe

14:54.390 --> 14:55.640
this is one of our best seasons.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.730
* Know I had to fight for you *

14:57.770 --> 15:00.350
* I put it all on the line
for you *
I tried to pick the artists

15:00.400 --> 15:02.860
that made me feel something,
that have passion,

15:02.900 --> 15:05.610
that had artistry, an emotional
connection to the music.

15:05.650 --> 15:07.740
And that's who I'm taking
to the playoffs with me.

15:07.780 --> 15:10.950
* Now let's go and win
"The Voice" *

15:10.990 --> 15:14.410
Daly:
Let's meet the artists he's
taking to the live playoffs.

15:14.450 --> 15:18.290
* I'm here without you, baby *

15:18.330 --> 15:20.290
* But you're still with me
in my dreams *

15:20.330 --> 15:22.460
Daly: Samuel Harness's soulful
and edgy sound

15:22.500 --> 15:24.290
brought something new
to "The Voice."

15:24.340 --> 15:30.180
* And tonight, girl,
it's only you and me *

15:30.220 --> 15:32.510
I grew up with a big family,

15:32.550 --> 15:34.470
and I'm one of five
adopted children.

15:34.510 --> 15:38.100
Fast-forward, I'm 26.
I have a 4-year-old son.

15:38.140 --> 15:39.890
To love unconditionally
is something

15:39.930 --> 15:41.350
that my son has taught me.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.360
John.
Whoo!

15:43.400 --> 15:47.530
Samuel is such an interesting,
unique, amazing singer.

15:47.570 --> 15:48.820
All right.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.150
I really do wish
that I had used my block there.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.860
Damn it.

15:52.910 --> 15:57.080
* There must be something
in the water *

15:57.120 --> 15:59.700
John: Samuel is raw.
He's passionate.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.580
He wears his heart
on his sleeve.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.630
And I think that's really
gonna connect with
a lot of our viewers.

16:04.670 --> 16:05.840
Oh, my God.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.590
That was beautiful.
I felt your heart.

16:08.630 --> 16:09.960
Amazing.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.220
Daly: Jershika Maple is
a security guard by day...

16:13.260 --> 16:14.720
Jershika:
It's kind of like TSA.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.970
I have to wand them
if they have any metals on them.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.520
I have power with the wand.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.100
They don't want to get wanded
by me, no. [ Laughs ]

16:22.140 --> 16:24.190
Daly:
...and as a singer at night.

16:24.230 --> 16:30.320
* Whoa *

16:30.360 --> 16:38.830
* Can you stand the rain *

16:38.870 --> 16:40.120
[ Cheers and applause ]

16:40.160 --> 16:42.040
I pick Team Kelly.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.330
What?!

16:43.370 --> 16:45.540
What is happening?

16:45.580 --> 16:48.960
Daly: But her time on Team Kelly
was short-lived.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.550
[ Whoosh ]
[ Screams ]

16:50.590 --> 16:53.130
That is the sound
of a steal!

16:53.170 --> 16:55.090
Shaking!

16:55.140 --> 16:58.890
* Ohhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

16:58.930 --> 17:01.520
* We're like a flower
to a tree *

17:01.560 --> 17:03.230
Hey!

17:03.270 --> 17:07.480
* Like words to a melody *

17:07.520 --> 17:10.360
John: Jershika is
a masterful vocalist.

17:10.400 --> 17:15.450
Oh, I'm so happy that
Kelly made the huge mistake

17:15.490 --> 17:17.450
of letting her slip
through her fingers

17:17.490 --> 17:20.450
and sending her over
to Team Legend.

17:20.490 --> 17:23.290
* Into the unknown *

17:23.330 --> 17:26.080
Daly: Next, it's pop singer
Joshua Vacanti.

17:26.120 --> 17:30.300
Hearing Joshua just wail
and hit those beautiful notes,

17:30.340 --> 17:32.460
I knew I had to have him
on my team.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.840
And as much as I hate
to deprive him

17:34.880 --> 17:37.970
of the opportunity
to work with Ariana,

17:38.010 --> 17:39.680
I'm also selfish.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.140
[ Laughs ]

17:41.180 --> 17:43.390
Ariana: John and I turn
for a lot of the same artists,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.140
and I love sharing
that space with him,

17:46.190 --> 17:48.650
but it's a blessing and a curse.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.650
Oh!

17:50.690 --> 17:52.730
Are you a theater person,
obviously? Yes?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.280
Yeah, I love theater.
I love gospel.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.570
Ooh.
I love pop.

17:55.610 --> 17:57.910
I am very shy
in my personal life.

17:57.950 --> 18:01.370
So being a part of the musicals
and drama club

18:01.410 --> 18:03.330
has always been
a really big outlet

18:03.370 --> 18:05.830
and something that brings me
so much joy.

18:05.870 --> 18:09.250
* Remember when you said you
wanted to give me the world? *

18:09.290 --> 18:11.170
Okay.
Hey!

18:11.210 --> 18:13.840
I love the personality,
especially in the verses.
* Woooorld *

18:13.880 --> 18:16.630
Yes, that.
Like, the almost, like,
Broadway-ish vibrato

18:16.680 --> 18:18.970
on a pop song gave me, like,
Queen/Freddie Mercury vibes.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.300
Yes!
The drama of it --
I loved it.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.680
* Maybe I'm too emotional *
Hey!

18:23.720 --> 18:26.560
* But your apathy's
like a wound in salt *

18:26.600 --> 18:28.690
Joshua is such
an incredible vocalist,

18:28.730 --> 18:31.860
like, just one of those guys
you can give any song to

18:31.900 --> 18:33.190
and he'll kill.

18:33.230 --> 18:34.980
* Maybe I'm too emotional *

18:35.030 --> 18:38.200
* But your apathy's like
a wound in salt *

18:38.240 --> 18:41.950
I think we embrace his
theatricality, we lean into it.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.240
He may change up the genre,

18:43.280 --> 18:45.660
but he's always
gonna sound like Joshua.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.370
Daly: Single mom Shadale

18:48.420 --> 18:50.080
gets her motivation
from her daughter.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.790
Shadale: I do corporate bands
on the weekend.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.170
And I do food delivery servicing
during the week,

18:55.210 --> 18:57.220
so I can take her
with me sometimes.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.220
<i>You got this, Mommy.</i>

18:58.260 --> 19:00.470
Oh, thank you, baby.

19:00.510 --> 19:02.600
Daly: But now she's ready
for the limelight.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.350
* That's what I like *

19:04.390 --> 19:06.140
* Oh ooo *
Hey!

19:06.180 --> 19:12.020
* Sex by the fire
at night *

19:13.270 --> 19:15.230
Tell us what song
you picked, Shadale.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.570
I chose "Impossible"
by Shontelle.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.570
Oh, cool.
My dreams and stuff
just seemed

19:19.610 --> 19:21.450
so far away
and impossible.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.280
So this song actually
kept me in the times.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.790
You know. Yeah.
That's amazing.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.580
Me and Ed are gonna sing
your background vocals.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.040
* Impossible *

19:29.080 --> 19:30.580
Both: * Impossible *

19:30.620 --> 19:33.250
* Impossible *

19:33.290 --> 19:36.920
* Whoa *

19:36.960 --> 19:38.590
Hey.

19:38.630 --> 19:40.630
It's not just about singing
in this competition.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.600
Part of it is about
making people feel something.

19:43.640 --> 19:50.390
* Tell them all I knoooow *

19:50.440 --> 19:54.650
* Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

19:54.690 --> 19:59.530
She really allows herself
to connect to that emotion.

19:59.570 --> 20:04.450
It's really hard to tap into,
like, your emotions...

20:04.490 --> 20:06.580
and still be able
to carry the song.

20:06.620 --> 20:11.160
You know, I obviously connected
to your message and...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.630
I would go with Shadale.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.460
Kelly: Shadale is someone
to look out for, y'all,

20:15.500 --> 20:16.960
because she is
one of those, like, dark horses

20:17.000 --> 20:19.090
in the competition,
where you're like,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.130
Wait, I knew you could
sing, but I didn't know
you were that good.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.930
That was beautiful.
It was really powerful.
Thank you.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.640
Daly: Next, it's the newest
addition to Team Legend,

20:26.680 --> 20:30.060
multi-talented
indie pop singer David Vogel.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.190
He started on Team Ariana.

20:32.230 --> 20:35.860
* Just keep breathin'
and breathin' and breathin' *

20:35.900 --> 20:40.110
* Oh, I gotta keep,
keep on breathin' *

20:40.150 --> 20:41.740
That was so beautiful.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.660
I thought it was
a really unique take.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.370
I loved that you play
an instrument, too.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.870
Absolutely. Yeah.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.160
I love all aspects of music --
recording and production

20:50.200 --> 20:54.500
and knowing how it all works,
to then performing live.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.380
Daly: When David and his locks
became available

20:56.420 --> 20:58.500
in the knockouts...

20:58.550 --> 21:05.180
* I needed to hate you
to love me *

21:05.220 --> 21:07.220
Daly: ...John didn't hesitate
to hit his button.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.760
Let's go!
Whoo! Yay!

21:09.810 --> 21:13.520
I love David because he has
so much love

21:13.560 --> 21:15.400
and connection to the music.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.360
John has done me a solid
by stealing David.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.520
You're back.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.860
So happy he's on Team Legend.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.860
Going to the live playoffs.
Let's do it.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.320
And you need a new robe.
Oh, dude!

21:26.360 --> 21:28.070
Welcome to Team Legend.

21:28.120 --> 21:33.370
Ladies and gentlemen,
my team is full!

21:33.410 --> 21:37.330
[ Cheers and applause ]

21:37.380 --> 21:39.750
Thank you!

21:39.790 --> 21:42.550
I need to dance
in front of Win Cam, too.

21:42.590 --> 21:45.090
I've got five reasons why
Team Legend

21:45.130 --> 21:47.550
is going to be a threat
in the lives.

21:47.590 --> 21:51.810
I've got Shadale, Joshua,
Jershika, Samuel,

21:51.850 --> 21:55.890
and I've got the newest member
of Team Legend -- David.

21:55.940 --> 22:00.650
I am so excited to take them
to the live playoffs.

22:06.650 --> 22:09.320
* This is "The Voice" *

22:09.370 --> 22:11.950
Welcome back to
"The Road to the Live Shows."

22:11.990 --> 22:15.580
Coach Kelly Clarkson returned to
"The Voice" determined to win,

22:15.620 --> 22:19.830
and her key to success --
navigating.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.840
I wanted to just hear your voice
in its pureness

22:22.880 --> 22:25.130
just holding out
and sustaining some notes.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.630
And so I was trying
to navigate through all those.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.050
It's really a good thing
to be able to navigate

22:30.100 --> 22:32.140
in all those little colors
of your voice.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.600
Without a doubt,
the most overused word

22:35.640 --> 22:37.140
on the coaching panel is...

22:37.190 --> 22:38.770
Navigate.
Navigate.
Navigate.

22:38.810 --> 22:41.820
Ariana and Blake have
a little drinking game

22:41.860 --> 22:45.110
where every time she says
the word "navigate"...

22:45.150 --> 22:47.490
I know how to...

22:47.530 --> 22:50.320
navigate...
a competition.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.740
They have a little sip.

22:51.780 --> 22:53.790
I've navigated a competition
before, but not --

22:53.830 --> 22:56.120
I said navigate. That's right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.540
John: Drink up.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.920
That word would be grateful
to never be used again.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.750
It's exhausted. It's tired.
It wants a hiatus.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.260
You're navigating
the competition.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.170
What are you supposed to say?
It's the right word.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.510
What, do I have to dumb it down?
Read a book!

23:09.550 --> 23:12.180
I'll try and use
smaller words, guys.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.510
Navigate.
Navigate.
Navigate.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.970
Daly: Here's how Kelly navigated

23:15.020 --> 23:16.890
forming her team this season.

23:16.930 --> 23:20.690
First, Girl Named Tom impressed
all four coaches..

23:20.730 --> 23:23.190
John: Four chairs!

23:23.230 --> 23:25.780
Yeah!

23:25.820 --> 23:28.320
Is your name Tom?
No, my name's actually Bekah.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.200
Oh.
But when I was a baby,
my brothers called me Thomas.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.990
Oh, that's cute.
What?! I love that!

23:34.030 --> 23:36.240
Caleb: We've been a band
for two years.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.910
Bekah:
We were homeschooled growing up,

23:37.950 --> 23:41.750
and I think that really affected
how close we are.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.380
Bekah, do you want eggs?

23:43.420 --> 23:45.210
Caleb: People might think it's
odd that we still live together.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.210
Josh: We're kind of poor,
so it makes financial sense.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.050
Yeah, it's so efficient.
It's absolutely true.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.890
* Down the seven *
* Seven *

23:52.930 --> 23:57.600
* Bridges ro-o-oad *

23:57.640 --> 24:01.140
Daly: They brought every coach
to their feet in the battles...

24:01.190 --> 24:05.020
Whoo!

24:06.520 --> 24:10.990
* Is still on the line *

24:11.030 --> 24:12.700
Daly:
...and in the knockouts.

24:12.740 --> 24:14.660
Blake: Wow.
That's Team Kelly!

24:14.700 --> 24:16.080
Okay, Team Kelly!

24:16.120 --> 24:19.870
I think if anybody
as a group could win this,

24:19.910 --> 24:21.870
a Girl Named Tom could be that.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.960
Daly: Gymani is a 23-year-old
single mom from Georgia.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.090
Gymani: I was 19 when I found
out I was pregnant.

24:28.130 --> 24:32.510
And I think that was
the best day of my life.

24:32.550 --> 24:34.430
My daughters are
the world to me.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.760
* Fallin' *

24:35.800 --> 24:37.510
* Got me right *
That's Ari's song.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.100
* I wanna love me *

24:40.140 --> 24:41.770
Sing!

24:41.810 --> 24:45.650
* The way,
the way you love me *

24:45.690 --> 24:47.610
[ Cheers and applause ]

24:47.650 --> 24:49.280
That's your song now.
Take it.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.490
I have <i>no one</i>on my team
like you.

24:53.530 --> 24:55.280
Kelly just flat-out
lied to you.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.580
That's not a lie.
I have no one on my team like --

24:57.620 --> 24:58.950
That's not a lie!

24:58.990 --> 25:00.580
I would like to call
a witness to the stand --

25:00.620 --> 25:01.870
Miss Ariana Grande...

25:01.910 --> 25:03.250
Wait. What?!
...to testify

25:03.290 --> 25:05.460
whether or not Kelly
has somebody like --

25:05.500 --> 25:09.130
I just left my body emotionally.
I'm not here right now.

25:09.170 --> 25:10.300
I pick Kelly.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.220
What?!

25:12.260 --> 25:14.550
What just happened?!

25:14.590 --> 25:16.640
She let Kelly lie.
This is a lie.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.350
'Cause she wouldn't
stand up to Kelly.

25:19.390 --> 25:20.640
And now you lost Gymani.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.270
I didn't have a chance.

25:22.310 --> 25:23.690
She sang your song.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.310
Do you see how hard it is to
get a word in around here?

25:26.350 --> 25:29.070
No one ever shuts up!

25:29.110 --> 25:30.360
Aah!

25:30.400 --> 25:31.900
[ Laughs ]

25:31.940 --> 25:35.030
* Fighting on *

25:35.070 --> 25:36.570
What?!

* It's our paradise *

25:39.080 --> 25:42.250
* And it's our war zone *

25:42.290 --> 25:44.830
Bloody hell, you've got
such a talent.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.170
* Here we go *

25:46.210 --> 25:49.340
* So we'll piss off
the neighbors *

25:49.380 --> 25:53.170
Gymani has such inventiveness,
such creativity,

25:53.210 --> 25:56.970
and competitive fire, and I love
watching Gymani sing.

25:57.010 --> 26:00.850
Daly:
Kelly and Blake's bickering
reached a new level this season.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.270
I feel like John and I
are parents on a vacation

26:03.310 --> 26:06.020
or a field trip
with our children.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.100
And you know
I like country music!

26:08.150 --> 26:11.110
And they're just, like, fighting
over toys and stuff.

26:11.150 --> 26:12.940
And you know what?
I could have sang country music,

26:12.980 --> 26:14.690
but, damn it,
I like all of it.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.820
[ Cheers and applause ]
I know you like
country music. But...

But what?

...I got her on my team.

From when we first met,

26:25.160 --> 26:27.460
like, kind of giving me crap,
like, right off the bat.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.170
You haven't hit your button.
Quit shaming me.

26:30.210 --> 26:32.170
I knew that you were
gonna blow this.

Oh, my God, I hate you.
I knew it, I knew it.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.760
I turned around way before...
You did.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.800
...everyone else.
That's fair.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.010
I don't know why being a spaz
with a button

26:43.060 --> 26:45.180
is such a --
such a great thing.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.730
Whatever. He pushes his button
fast all the time.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.270
Oh, my God!

26:49.310 --> 26:51.400
These two cannot stop
fighting each other

or involving you.
This...has nothing to do

26:54.110 --> 26:55.900
with you guys right now.
Yes, exactly.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.530
Exactly.
Let us have our moment!

26:58.570 --> 27:00.780
I want them both
to stop arguing!

27:00.820 --> 27:02.160
I hate being
in the middle of it!

And if you win with Kelly,
yeah, you still win.

you know?

27:06.330 --> 27:08.420

The fact is the fact -- I have
won this show more than she has.

And his knockout performance

27:38.240 --> 27:40.820
was dedicated
to someone special.

I've got a daughter,
my baby girl,

how she ran to me

I was always her safe space.

conversational about it.

such a good heart.

see what he's gonna do
in the live playoffs.

Daly: 13-year-old Hailey Mia

28:19.070 --> 28:21.150
is the youngest artist
left in the competition.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.240
Hailey: Being here is definitely
a very different experience.

28:24.280 --> 28:27.330
I don't really go out
and do, like, big performances,

28:27.370 --> 28:31.920
but I do gig for my teddy bears
in my room, if that counts.

28:31.960 --> 28:40.130
* What do you think would
happen? *

28:40.170 --> 28:43.510
* Ohhhhh *

28:43.550 --> 28:45.510
I just wanted to let you know,
I turned around first.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.680
[ Laughs ]

28:46.720 --> 28:48.680
I pick Ariana.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.100
[ Groans ]

28:50.140 --> 28:53.190
Blake: Not only is she
an incredible singer,

28:53.230 --> 28:54.980
she's 13 years old.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.560
13 years old.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.490
* Fill up and you don't
have to pa-a-a-y *

29:01.530 --> 29:03.700
Whoo!

29:03.740 --> 29:06.910
Daly: We've got a steal!

29:06.950 --> 29:09.240
I turned for her in the blinds,
and I didn't get her.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.250
I knew I would be
a good coach for her.

29:11.290 --> 29:14.000
I somehow knew she would end up
with me.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.580
Katie:
I sang my whole life.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.210
But first time I ever did a gig
was when I was in my 30s,

29:18.250 --> 29:20.920
so I'm just
really happy to be here.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.260
Daly: Next up,
36-year-old Katie Rae,

29:23.300 --> 29:26.180
who came to "The Voice"
to inspire her son.

29:26.220 --> 29:28.300
Katie: I've been away
from my husband and my son.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.890
They mean everything to me.

29:29.930 --> 29:33.730
They're my whole world,
and I want to make them proud.

29:33.770 --> 29:36.560
<i>Say, "Love you, Mommy.</i>
<i>We got you."</i>
<i>I got you.</i>

29:36.600 --> 29:42.740
* Took a hard left,
but we're alright *

29:42.780 --> 29:45.110
* Yeah, life sure... *

29:45.160 --> 29:47.370
Daly: She had Kelly,
Ariana, and John

29:47.410 --> 29:49.080
in a three-way battle.
Yes!

29:49.120 --> 29:50.580
Kelly: There's a lot of people
that can sing,

29:50.620 --> 29:52.250
but there's not a lot of people
that can move you.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.870
I turned pretty early
for you.

29:53.910 --> 29:56.250
We'll have so much fun tog--

Oh, my God!

29:59.960 --> 30:03.090

30:03.130 --> 30:04.590
I'm gonna go with Ariana.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.090
[ Cheers and applause ]

30:06.130 --> 30:07.930
Katie Rae -- I loved her,
and I was so bummed

30:07.970 --> 30:10.220
that I didn't get her
in the blinds, and I was like,

30:10.260 --> 30:12.640
Ugh, here's to me,
losing to Ariana every time,

30:12.680 --> 30:13.890
is what I was thinking.

30:13.930 --> 30:17.940
* I have reached the end *

30:17.980 --> 30:21.320
Daly: But things turned around
for Kelly in the knockouts.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.400
I'm very thankful that
Katie Rae gets to stay.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.160
I just think she has one of
the best voices that I've heard,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.280
and I love her
with all my heart.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.120
Whoo! Thank you all!

30:31.160 --> 30:33.950
I've wanted Katie Rae
since the blinds, y'all,
so I finally got her.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.830
I did not want to go home.
You're gonna look really cute in
my turquoise jacket.

30:36.870 --> 30:39.130
Do I get one?
Yes!

30:39.170 --> 30:41.250
I've never been more proud
moving forward

30:41.290 --> 30:43.630
to the live playoffs
with a team as a whole.

30:43.670 --> 30:46.130
I don't even have to say
the coaches better be scared.

30:46.170 --> 30:48.680
They're scared.
They've heard my team.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.180
Watch out for Team Kelly, y'all.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.260
I've still got it.
John: You still got it.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.220
Look at you!
Look at you!

31:00.360 --> 31:01.860
* This is "The Voice" *

I'm back to winning again.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.050
Yeah!

31:25.090 --> 31:27.590
I'm actually here to get
my ninth win.

31:27.630 --> 31:30.220
Yes, you heard right --
my ninth win.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.850
Blake.
Yes!

31:31.890 --> 31:33.390
Blake.
Whoo!

31:33.430 --> 31:36.640
That's my number-one gift I give
people, is the championship.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.890
Blake is a pro. He's been
doing this for a while.
That's right.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.730
If you watch this show,
you know that brag I little bit

31:42.770 --> 31:44.980
when somebody chooses me
as their coach,

31:45.030 --> 31:46.230
and so I wanted a Win Cam.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.110
Yes! Yes! Whoo!

31:49.150 --> 31:50.910
It's just another camera.

31:50.950 --> 31:54.410
My team might as well be full!

31:54.450 --> 31:56.490
Daly: But even champions
need alliances.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.250
Hey, that's Ariana Grande.
Look how awesome she is.

31:59.290 --> 32:02.080
And he formed an unlikely one
this season.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.590
I can have an unbiased opinion
here

32:04.630 --> 32:08.010
and try to help you
choose Ariana as your coach.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.800
Oh, my goodness.
Blake Shelton!

32:09.840 --> 32:12.300
Blake: I know out of
the other three coaches

32:12.340 --> 32:16.220
who has the most savage
and active fan base.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.310
All: Ari! Ari! Ari!

32:18.350 --> 32:20.940
And I want Ariana fans
on my side.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.400
Thank you so much
for teaching me.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.400
Proud of you.
Proud of you, little buddy.

It was like, whoa, my new
bestie, she's got my back.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.530
Don't you think
I would be a great coach?

32:29.570 --> 32:30.990
You know what?
For Jeremy?

32:31.030 --> 32:33.280
You want my real opinion?
Depends.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.410
Daly: But it was over
as quickly as it started.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.410
I think that Kelly
would be able to help you.

32:39.450 --> 32:41.620
Oh, my gosh.
I think so, too.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.000
I got to go Team Kelly.
Yes!

32:44.040 --> 32:46.290
That was sisters before misters
right there.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.710
You put her on the spot.
And she spoke the truth!

32:47.750 --> 32:50.170
Because I thought
she was my friend!

32:50.220 --> 32:53.760
I can't believe Ariana
just did that

32:53.800 --> 32:56.350
after having her back,
trying to help her.

32:56.390 --> 32:58.390
So the gloves
are off now, huh?

32:58.430 --> 33:00.140
Mm-hmm.
I know he's not my ally.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.140
He thinks I don't see
right through him, but I do.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.480
I have a new ally.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.230
I was right here
on the edge of the cliff,

33:05.270 --> 33:06.770
and you pushed me off
the cliff.

33:06.820 --> 33:09.190
I don't think that that's how
you should look at it.

33:09.230 --> 33:11.530
Oh, this is serious.
Is this serious?

when I need her?

33:21.450 --> 33:23.670

without allies

and built
his 21st playoff team.

Blake used his only block

for veteran soul singer
Wendy Moten.

if you still got it.

John: I'm always gonna be
a little bit upset

33:42.890 --> 33:44.310
that Blake blocked me.

33:44.350 --> 33:45.810
Did you hit the block,
really?

33:45.850 --> 33:47.440
I don't -- still don't think
I did.

that's gonna lie to you?

a front-runner

in the competition right now.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.760
Team Blake all the way!

Daly: 29-year-old country singer
Lana Scott took a chance

34:22.720 --> 34:25.690
when she moved from Chesapeake,
Virginia, to California.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.230
Lana: I moved out here
to be an artist,

34:28.270 --> 34:30.820
so being here at "The Voice"

34:30.860 --> 34:35.150
to learn feels just like
the next big step for me.

* There's a hole in the bottle,
leakin' all this wine *

34:40.120 --> 34:42.410
My God. Thank you
for coming to this show

34:42.450 --> 34:45.040
and bringing
what you do to "The Voice."

34:45.080 --> 34:46.580
I think that I would be
a really good coach for you.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.790
I think
you would look really snazzy

34:48.830 --> 34:51.090
in this turquoise number
right here.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.750
After 21 seasons

34:52.800 --> 34:54.920
of doing this --
Oh, God. Oh, God. Again.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.760
Grandpa's telling
his war stories again.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.010
I try to offer them a trophy
at the end of this thing.

35:00.050 --> 35:02.640
Can Ariana and I talk at all?
And the fact that she --

35:02.680 --> 35:04.520
Anybody who says...
No.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.930
...they don't understand
the value...

35:05.980 --> 35:07.310
Absolutely -- Do you want
to get a snack, actually?

35:07.350 --> 35:09.060
Yeah, let's get a snack.
We'll come back.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.310
See you guys later.
...somebody has
a whiny country voice...

35:11.360 --> 35:12.570
I don't know where they went.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.940
They got out of their chairs
and left.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.990
I didn't care.
I was still in battle mode.

35:17.030 --> 35:21.320
Daly: But the stalemate ended
in a victory for Team Blake.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.740
Blake.
Yes!

35:22.780 --> 35:24.870
Daly: She was almost sent home
after her battle,

35:24.910 --> 35:27.000
but her coach gave her
another shot.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.670
Wait a minute, Lana.
You're not going anywhere.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.630
Some of my favorite
songs of yours

35:31.670 --> 35:35.210
are the heartfelt,
love-lost songs...
Mm-hmm.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.430
And when I hear you,
I believe you.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.840
How do you tap into that?

35:39.880 --> 35:43.810
I always pretend like
I'm somebody else.
Right.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.560
When I play live,
I think less about

35:45.600 --> 35:47.140
how I feel about it
and more about

35:47.180 --> 35:48.350
how other people
feel about it.

35:48.390 --> 35:51.980
* Wildest dreams *

35:52.020 --> 35:53.940
* Yea-a-a-a-a-ah *

35:53.980 --> 35:55.980
I think Lana is
the only country artist

35:56.030 --> 35:57.690
going into the lives
this season.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.820
This girl's got a real shot
at this thing.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.200
Great job, sis.
Great job.
Thank you so much.

Daly: Blake is also taking
West African soul singer

36:05.540 --> 36:07.410
Libianca with him to
the playoffs.

36:07.450 --> 36:10.170
When I was 13 years old,
I moved to America.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.710
It was very hard
to make friends.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.750
<i>One morning,</i>
<i>I came back from work.</i>

36:13.790 --> 36:16.710

<i>We decided to give everything</i>
<i>that she needs for her music.</i>

36:20.470 --> 36:23.470
<i>On that stage,</i>
<i>you'll be carrying</i>

36:23.510 --> 36:26.180
<i>the light of Africa</i>
<i>as a whole.</i>

* Always inside *

36:32.560 --> 36:35.610
* Good day living in my mind *

36:35.650 --> 36:39.360
I am obviously
the coach for you.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.860
Why?

36:40.900 --> 36:43.870
[ Laughter ]
She said, "Why?"

36:43.910 --> 36:46.200
"Why?" Ha-ha!

36:46.240 --> 36:47.870
Is about whatever
I can do

36:47.910 --> 36:50.910
that can help you be the best
at whatever you want to be.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.550

37:00.590 --> 37:02.050
No one saw that coming.

37:02.090 --> 37:06.930
God came down with tablets
and said, "Pick Blake."

37:06.970 --> 37:08.850
[ Laughter ]

37:08.890 --> 37:10.730
I have a feeling Blake
is gonna be the one

37:10.770 --> 37:13.310
to really just help me
just do my thing.

37:13.350 --> 37:15.610
* If they knew what they said *

37:15.650 --> 37:17.900
* Would it go
straight to my head? *

37:17.940 --> 37:21.900
* What would they say instead? *

37:21.950 --> 37:24.700
Blake:
Libianca is my R&B soul artist

37:24.740 --> 37:28.080
that has so much emotion
wrapped up in her performances

37:28.120 --> 37:31.250
that it sets her apart from
the rest of the competition.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.960
Incredible job, sis.
Thank you.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.580
So much of the show
is just gonna be me

37:34.620 --> 37:36.960
pointing at Blake
in despair.
Doing this?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.460
Like, so much of it is gonna
be like cuts of me going like...

37:39.500 --> 37:41.800
And then like...
Yeah. Squinty eyes at me?

37:41.840 --> 37:43.220
[ Chuckles ]

37:43.260 --> 37:46.260
Daly: Coming up, Blake rounds
out his team with style.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.760
Yeah!

37:47.800 --> 37:49.850
And find out
what it's really like

37:49.890 --> 37:51.270
behind the scenes...
[ Shatters ]

37:51.310 --> 37:54.690
...when we return
with never-before-seen footage.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.820
* This is "The Voice" *

38:02.860 --> 38:04.320
Daly: Welcome back to
"The Road to the Live Shows."

38:04.360 --> 38:07.530
Let's see how Blake completed
his live playoff team.

38:07.570 --> 38:10.080
* Well, since my baby left me *

38:10.120 --> 38:13.830
Daly: Next up is Peedy Chavis,
a young man with an old soul.

38:13.870 --> 38:15.330
* It's at the end
of Lonely Street *

38:15.370 --> 38:17.880
* At Heartbreak Hotel *

38:17.920 --> 38:21.210
When I was a little kid,
my mom showed me Elvis

38:21.250 --> 38:23.130
and I was just infatuated,

38:23.170 --> 38:24.800
and I want to be singing
that music

38:24.840 --> 38:28.430
and bringing that back
to the next generation.

38:28.470 --> 38:29.890
* Yeah *

38:29.930 --> 38:32.770
Blake: He's got so much
confidence on stage.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.350
This is huge for "The Voice."

38:34.390 --> 38:36.940
Can you do the hair thing
one more time for me? Yeah!

38:36.980 --> 38:38.520
John: I've been a fan of Peedy
since the beginning.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.570
It's not just shtick.
Like, he can really sing, too.

38:41.610 --> 38:45.570
* Unchain my heart *

38:45.610 --> 38:47.740
* Baby, let me go *

38:47.780 --> 38:51.080
Don't be afraid to attack
the song vocally.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.200
Absolutely, yeah.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.830
You need to have this song
by the throat.

38:53.870 --> 38:55.870
* Chain my heaaaaart *

38:55.910 --> 38:58.460
* Unchain my heart *

38:58.500 --> 39:00.790
Blake: I've never been more
excited to see what happens

39:00.840 --> 39:03.380
with an artist than Peedy
going into the live.

39:03.420 --> 39:07.430
I'm dying to see
how America reacts to this guy.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.140
* Superstition ain't the *

39:10.180 --> 39:11.640
* Way-ay-ay *

39:11.680 --> 39:13.600
Daly:
And finally, it's Navy veteran

39:13.640 --> 39:15.770
and R&B vocalist,
Paris Winningham.

39:15.810 --> 39:19.650
Paris: When I was 20,
I decided to join the Navy.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.770
My chief heard that,
yo, Paris can sing,

39:22.820 --> 39:24.070
and I sang the national anthem.

39:24.110 --> 39:26.900
When I got done,
everywhere I was walking,

39:26.950 --> 39:28.610
"Dude, you can sing, man!"

39:28.660 --> 39:31.070
It gave me
that push to make the career

39:31.120 --> 39:33.580
that I've always wanted,
and that was music.

39:33.620 --> 39:36.080
That was incredible.
You had the crowd going.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.080
Maybe I screwed up
by not hitting my button.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.790
Daly:
He started on Team Legend,

39:39.830 --> 39:42.250
but Paris came up for grabs
in the knockouts.

39:42.290 --> 39:48.260
* Said you're as wa-a-a-rm
as a glass of brandy *

39:48.300 --> 39:50.090
Blake: His knockout performance
was incredible,

39:50.140 --> 39:52.050
and there's no way
I'm gonna sit there

39:52.100 --> 39:53.720
and not use my steal on him.

39:53.760 --> 39:59.140
* I stay stoned
on your love *

39:59.190 --> 40:00.150
[ Whoosh ]

40:00.190 --> 40:01.940
Daly: That's the sound
of a steal

40:01.980 --> 40:03.860
from Blake Shelton!

40:03.900 --> 40:08.780
To have an opportunity
like this...

40:08.820 --> 40:11.030
I wouldn't exchange that
for the world.

40:11.070 --> 40:13.280
Congratulations, man.
Thank you so much.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.370
Blake: All the artists
going into the live playoffs

40:15.410 --> 40:16.910
are absolutely amazing.

40:16.950 --> 40:19.660
It's gonna be one of
the best seasons we've ever had.

40:19.710 --> 40:22.290
Team Blake is lightning
and a little bit

40:22.330 --> 40:24.250
of a thunderstorm
with a tornado in it.

40:24.290 --> 40:27.340
I don't really feel
any competition at this point.

40:27.380 --> 40:29.510
Kelly: Man, there's so much
talent this season,

40:29.550 --> 40:31.470
and I can't wait for everybody
to get to hear everyone.

40:31.510 --> 40:33.970
John: The other coaches should
be looking out for Team Legend.

40:34.010 --> 40:36.510
We have such
an amazing group of vocalists.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.930
Ariana:
I'm so excited for the lives,
but it's in your hands now.

40:39.980 --> 40:44.480
Do not mess this up, please.
My team is too good.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.110
All right, so now that you're
all caught up with this season,

40:48.150 --> 40:51.820
here are some never-before-seen
moments of our coaches.

40:51.860 --> 40:54.240
Marker.
Here we go, y'all.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.450
[ Laughs ]

40:55.490 --> 40:56.490
Breaking
the fourth wall.

40:56.530 --> 40:57.660
Oh.
Okay.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.660
Yes, get the shot.

40:58.700 --> 41:01.000
I'm gonna watch playback

41:01.040 --> 41:03.250
on this piece of paper.
Well, it's not in there.

41:03.290 --> 41:07.710
I'm gonna watch playback
on this notebook I have here.

so good *

* So good, so good, so good *

Are you a Pokémon fan?
[Bleep] yeah.
I am. I am.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.440
What is your favorite Pokémon?
Squirtle.

41:30.490 --> 41:31.860
Sure.
Squirtle.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.610
I just noticed that
it says "voo" behind you.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.870
"Voo"?
It does say "voo."

41:36.910 --> 41:38.450
* This is "The Voo" *
What does that mean?

41:38.490 --> 41:40.040
* This is "The Voo" *
Is it like...

41:40.080 --> 41:41.960
That means 500.
I just got it!

41:42.000 --> 41:43.330
* Don't break my heart *

41:43.370 --> 41:45.710
* My achy Blake-y heart *
Whoa!

41:45.750 --> 41:47.630
What's your favorite cheese?
Ooh, Gouda.

Gouda! Smoked Gouda
is my favorite cheese.

Good catch.

this season,
