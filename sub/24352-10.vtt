- Welcome to "Fool Us,"

00:43.470 --> 00:45.570
where the best magicians
in the world

00:45.570 --> 00:48.000
try to fool
two world-famous magicians

00:48.000 --> 00:50.030
who know they are
being fooled with.

00:50.030 --> 00:51.370
No fooling.

00:51.370 --> 00:53.770
And now let's bring out
two magicians

00:53.770 --> 00:57.300
who are nobody's fool,
Penn and Teller.

01:04.099 --> 01:07.100
[cheers and applause]

01:14.900 --> 01:17.530
Any magician
that successfully fools

01:17.530 --> 01:19.600
two of the greatest minds
in magic

01:19.600 --> 01:22.870
will win an all-expenses-paid
trip to Vegas to perform

01:22.870 --> 01:25.800
in Penn and Teller's
world-famous magic show.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.570
So let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.670
- I am the digital magician.

01:32.670 --> 01:36.170
That means that I combine
magic with technology.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.570
It's very important to keep up
with technology

01:38.570 --> 01:40.400
and with all the changes
that are happening,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.570
because these days you can't
do an act for 50 years.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.670
So I keep an eye
on what's coming up

01:45.670 --> 01:50.030
and what can I do to
incorporate it into my magic.

01:50.030 --> 01:51.700
I was on "Penn & Teller"
three years ago,

01:51.700 --> 01:55.500
and Penn and Teller said
"Simon, you 100% fooled us...

01:55.500 --> 01:58.170
three weeks ago when we
watched you on TV."

01:58.170 --> 01:59.900
- And that's the problem.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.030
Magicians watch
other magicians.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.630
- To fool them, you have
to be one step ahead.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.570
So this time I trained really
hard for my performance.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.500
I tried to analyze
how they think

02:10.500 --> 02:12.870
and find an appropriate
test audience.

02:12.870 --> 02:15.070

02:15.070 --> 02:18.430

02:18.430 --> 02:19.730

02:19.730 --> 02:22.600
Penn and Teller,
it's good to see you again.

It's wonderful to be back.

02:37.070 --> 02:38.270
To begin,

02:38.270 --> 02:41.530
I made a list on my phone
with celebrities.

02:41.530 --> 02:44.900
I've included Emma Stone,
famous for being an actress,

02:44.900 --> 02:47.330
Lionel Richie,
famous for being a singer,

02:47.330 --> 02:51.370

give it to someone else,

03:03.500 --> 03:04.770

the same

03:04.770 --> 03:06.000
and so on and so on.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.270
Okay? Thank you.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.830
You can start doing the list.

In the meantime, I'll show you
a bit of my magic.

That was amazing.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.400
Ah.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.670
So I'm guessing
you could market that,

07:24.670 --> 07:26.330
and that would be
very popular.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.830
A lot of people would buy
that machine.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.500
- I guess so, yeah.

07:29.500 --> 07:33.030
- So what kind of tricks will
be coming up next for you?

07:33.030 --> 07:35.330
- I'm reaching out
in all kinds of technology--

07:35.330 --> 07:37.600
virtual reality,
augmented reality.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.270
The great thing
about technology--

07:39.270 --> 07:41.630
it changes so fast
that the inspiration

07:41.630 --> 07:43.470
is there from one day
to the other.

07:43.470 --> 07:46.300
So you're just following up
with what happens.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.030
If you had told me
ten years ago,

07:48.030 --> 07:49.830
"Simon, you're gonna be
the iPad Magician."

07:49.830 --> 07:50.870
- Yeah.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.070
- I didn't even know
what iPad was,

07:52.070 --> 07:53.300
because it wasn't created, so.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.700
- That's amazing.
Well, look at you now.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.200
You've got double iPads.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.230
- Double iPad, three--
yeah, I made it.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.830
Next time I'll come with four.

08:00.830 --> 08:03.270
- All right, let's find out
if you fooled them.

08:03.270 --> 08:04.570
Penn, Teller.

08:04.570 --> 08:05.870
- I will tell you, Simon,

08:05.870 --> 08:08.070
we've seen a lot
of people do

08:08.070 --> 08:10.900
the film-to-life thing
with the iPad.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.730
And that is a question of just
the cleverness and timing,

08:14.730 --> 08:17.030
and everything has
to be split-second and perfect.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.800
And of all the people
we've seen do it,

08:18.800 --> 08:21.170
and it's a zillion,
you are the best at that.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.500
- Oh, thanks.
- Unbelievable.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.970
[cheers and applause]

08:26.970 --> 08:30.370
We tend to think
of the perfect timing

08:30.370 --> 08:33.770
and perfect moves being
in card magic or little stuff.

08:33.770 --> 08:39.000
But to make those iPad things
look as good as you do

08:39.000 --> 08:41.070
is just millimeters,
and timing is perfect.

08:41.070 --> 08:42.400
We just love that,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.200
but we've already covered that
and other issues.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.430
We're down to talk
about the big picture.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.170
And there's a moral issue here,
of course,

08:48.170 --> 08:49.670
is if we deal
with 3D printing,

08:49.670 --> 08:51.870
in order to keep
the morality proper,

08:51.870 --> 08:54.770
you have to kill the person
that walks into the machine

08:54.770 --> 08:56.430
when the other person
comes out.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.600
So I assume that wherever
Marie Osmond was,

08:58.600 --> 09:00.370
that one has been killed,
is that correct?

09:00.370 --> 09:02.570
- [laughs]
- Oh, no.

09:02.570 --> 09:05.430
- You know, technology
is the key to this, actually,

09:05.430 --> 09:09.100
although there are age-old
optical principles.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.900
The stuff that seems
the least important

09:10.900 --> 09:13.030
is often, as you know,
the most important.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.070
When you carry
the phone over to me,

09:15.070 --> 09:17.000
there's moments
when it's just an offbeat

09:17.000 --> 09:18.600
when stuff can happen.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.470
We also think this is
a beautiful optical principle,

09:21.470 --> 09:25.470
but we actually do not think
it is a real 3D printer.

09:25.470 --> 09:27.970
[laughter]

09:27.970 --> 09:30.530
- So did they give
you enough information?

09:30.530 --> 09:33.200
- Oh, for sure, for sure,
and the great thing about it,

09:33.200 --> 09:34.570
I would come back a third time.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.500

I am very boyish, unassuming,

10:20.170 --> 10:24.570
but I really enjoy embracing
mystery and the unknown.

and those locked doors

unnerving sometimes.

I created this show called
"Séance."

10:34.770 --> 10:36.730
It's sort of an interactive
ghost story.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.670
We take a random member
of the audience

10:38.670 --> 10:41.930
and use them to communicate
with the dead.

10:41.930 --> 10:45.730
The whole point was to explore
the fear of the unknown.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.670
I had a good friend once say

10:47.670 --> 10:50.300
that I was pure evil wrapped
in Mr. Rogers' sweater.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.470
[laughter]

10:51.470 --> 10:54.370
And I thought,
"I like that."

10:54.370 --> 10:57.370
[applause]

10:58.500 --> 11:03.130
- Give it up for the scary-cool
magic of Nicholas Wallace.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.700
[cheers and applause]

11:04.700 --> 11:06.470
- Thank you.
Alyson, do you want to

11:06.470 --> 11:08.630
join me over here, please?

11:08.630 --> 11:11.130
Alyson, ladies and gentlemen.
- [chuckles]

11:11.130 --> 11:14.000
- Have a seat.
- Thank you. Hi.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.570
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:15.570 --> 11:18.200
- So, Alyson,
we're going to test your luck.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.300
- Oh.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.700
- And to do this,
we're gonna use

11:20.700 --> 11:23.330
the safest and most wholesome
things in the world--

11:23.330 --> 11:25.430
milk and cookies.
- Oh, okay.

11:25.430 --> 11:26.930
- So here's how this
is gonna work.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.430
I'd like you to place
your left hand

11:28.430 --> 11:30.170
right here like--
about, like, that. Good.

11:30.170 --> 11:33.030
In a moment, I'm gonna place
a cookie on your hand.

11:33.030 --> 11:34.700
I want you to wait.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.100
Just wait until you hear me
knock twice

11:37.100 --> 11:38.570
and say, "Go."

11:38.570 --> 11:39.730
When I do that,

11:39.730 --> 11:41.430
you're gonna eat
the whole cookie

11:41.430 --> 11:42.870
as quickly as you can.
- [chuckles]

11:42.870 --> 11:45.570
- Just shove the whole cookie
in your mouth

11:45.570 --> 11:47.170
and then put your hand back.

11:47.170 --> 11:48.830
Okay?
- Okay.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.870
- It's important
that you put your hand back

11:50.870 --> 11:52.970
because there's two more
cookies coming.

11:52.970 --> 11:55.000
- Do I have to eat those, too?
- Yes. Yes.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.270
Just shove them in
your mouth and chew.

11:56.270 --> 11:57.800
- I feel like you should have
picked somebody else.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.030
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Okay.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.770
- So three cookies
in total, okay?

12:00.770 --> 12:02.700
- I was trying not
to do gluten.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.500
So I'm guessing this
is gonna be a cheat day.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.870
It's fine. It's fine.
- Yes. It's only three.

12:06.870 --> 12:08.200
It's only three.
- Oh, great.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.700
- It's important
that you listen

12:09.700 --> 12:10.970
to the instructions as well

12:10.970 --> 12:14.270
because you're going
to be wearing this.

12:14.270 --> 12:16.030
- [groans]
- It's a blindfold.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.270
- Oh.
- Do you mind?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.370
- I mean, it doesn't matter
if I do.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.770
So, okay.
[laughter]

12:24.430 --> 12:25.600
- Is that comfortable?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.900
- I mean, I've had more
comfortable, but sure.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.130
[laughter]

12:29.130 --> 12:31.230
- Can you see this?
Can you see anything?

12:31.230 --> 12:32.870
- I see a blindfold.

12:32.870 --> 12:35.030
- Perfect.
Okay, don't worry, Alyson.

12:35.030 --> 12:37.570
You can trust me.
- I don't think so.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.570
[light orchestral music]

12:44.170 --> 12:45.800
- I don't like the music.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.630
[laughter]

13:39.430 --> 13:41.430
[laughter]

13:41.430 --> 13:42.700
- You there, Alyson?

13:42.700 --> 13:45.770
- I don't know.
What's taking so long?

13:45.770 --> 13:48.470
- Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.470
Ready?
Go.

14:00.930 --> 14:02.400
[muffled]
Are you okay?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.170
- [mumbling]
- Are you fine?

14:04.170 --> 14:05.800
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.800
- This is not going so well.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.530
- Don't move.
Don't move.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.300
- I have to eat another one?

14:18.300 --> 14:20.500
- Not yet.
- Aw, man.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.530
- Wait.
- I'm still--

14:26.530 --> 14:27.930
- Go!
- No.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.370
- [muffled speech]

14:32.770 --> 14:35.100
- Are you okay?
- I don't like this trick.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.000
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.700
- I can't do it.

14:43.770 --> 14:46.000
- Don't move yet.
Don't move.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.330
Okay.

14:52.330 --> 14:54.600
Don't eat it yet.
- I can't!

14:54.600 --> 14:56.170
- I'm gonna take
your blindfold off.

14:56.170 --> 14:57.830
- Oh, God.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.270
- How's it going?

15:01.270 --> 15:03.570
- [muffled speech]
- That's all right.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.230
Before we do this--

15:05.230 --> 15:06.830
You like that cookie?
Is it good?

15:06.830 --> 15:08.700
Do you want to switch?
Is it fine?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.900
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.670
Go.

15:14.930 --> 15:16.870
- What--

15:16.870 --> 15:18.670
what a weird trick.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.700
[laughter]

15:35.000 --> 15:37.370
- Aw, that was mean.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.370
[laughter and applause]

15:41.970 --> 15:43.730
- Your milk.

15:45.870 --> 15:48.070
Give Alyson
a round of applause.

15:48.070 --> 15:50.430
[cheers and applause]

15:50.430 --> 15:53.370
Mm, thank you.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.670
- Nicholas Wallace!

15:55.670 --> 15:57.930
[cheers and applause]

15:57.930 --> 15:59.470
- You can, uh--
- Okay, wow.

15:59.470 --> 16:00.830
Well, that was disturbing.

16:00.830 --> 16:02.230
- Do you want another--
- No.

16:02.230 --> 16:04.730
I'm not gonna take
anything from you.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.100
That was really gross.

16:06.100 --> 16:09.200
That's why you don't take food
from strangers.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.200
- I suppose, yes.
- Man, you're pretty strange.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.630
- I will take
that as a compliment.

16:14.630 --> 16:16.170
Thank you. Thank you.
- [laughs]

16:16.170 --> 16:17.230
- I mean, at the end
of the day,

16:17.230 --> 16:18.770
all we did was eat
some milk and cookies.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.270
- Yeah,
but you tried to kill me.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.070
- Well, unsuccessfully...
[laughter]

16:22.070 --> 16:23.570
I suppose, but--
- Yeah.

16:23.570 --> 16:26.300
There's some questions
I have for the producers later.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.670
- [laughs]
- I'm a little--

16:28.670 --> 16:31.570
You seem so nice,
but you're not.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.270
You're just mean.
- Well, well, I mean...

16:34.270 --> 16:36.070
- What if I had switched
the cookie?

16:36.070 --> 16:38.630
- I don't know. It would have
been a very different show...

16:38.630 --> 16:40.170
I suppose.
- Yeah.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.400
I guess so.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.630
All right, well,
let's see if your cookie magic

16:43.630 --> 16:45.800
fooled the boys.
- Okay.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.300
- Boy, we get a lot--
see, here's the problem.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.870
For those who watched
"Fool Us," other episodes,

16:50.870 --> 16:54.670
we have been fooled by
a [bleep] cookie before.

16:54.670 --> 16:56.000
[laughter]

16:56.000 --> 16:58.770
We do not want to be fooled
by a [bleep] cookie.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.270
Teller...

17:01.270 --> 17:04.430
has been sure...

17:04.430 --> 17:07.730
that it's similar
to the last time we were wrong.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.400
I'm not gonna let him do that.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.800
He thinks that--I'm not--
this is not our guess.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.099
'Cause he thinks you dumped
that cookie

17:16.099 --> 17:18.470
into the glass of milk
that you're holding there,

17:18.470 --> 17:20.430
that you dumped the cookie
with the razor blade

17:20.430 --> 17:22.730
into the glass of milk
that you're holding.

17:22.730 --> 17:25.300
And I do not think so.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.000
I do not think so.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.600
I think you can drink
that whole glass of milk,

17:28.600 --> 17:32.270
and there's not--there's not
a cookie in the bottom.

17:32.270 --> 17:34.900
[laughter]

17:37.300 --> 17:40.130
- Do it.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.600
And I'm so glad it's soy milk
right now.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.170
Ha ha!

17:44.170 --> 17:47.400
And it's warm
and not tasty.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.300
It's not even vanilla.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.700
- Exactly.

17:50.700 --> 17:54.500
And I think that
the razor blades are also real.

17:55.770 --> 18:00.200
- And I think you are
really, really, really good

18:00.200 --> 18:03.270
at sleight of hand
and all blindfolds are fake.

18:03.270 --> 18:05.830
It's not sleight of mouth,
it's not sleight of cookie,

18:05.830 --> 18:07.870
and what a great idea
for a trick.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.200
- What--was sleight
of hand involved?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.470
And were you wearing
a blindfold?

18:12.470 --> 18:14.000
- I was wearing--Oh, yes.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.970
[laughter]

18:15.970 --> 18:17.530
I was, yes.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.870
- It was sleight of hand.
You were palming it off.

18:20.870 --> 18:22.230
Was it sleight of hand?

18:22.230 --> 18:23.700
- Mm, not exac--no.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.170
- It's not sleight of hand?
- No.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.670
We're fooled
by another cookie.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.470
- [laughs]

18:30.470 --> 18:31.570
You fooled them!

18:31.570 --> 18:34.530
- We're fooled
by another cookie.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.570
That's all.
Fooled by another cookie.

18:37.570 --> 18:40.170
- Oh, my goodness.

18:40.170 --> 18:43.200
[cheers and applause]

18:45.230 --> 18:47.400
- Do you want one?
- Nicholas Wallace!

18:47.400 --> 18:50.030
- No, thank you.
[cheers and applause]

18:50.030 --> 18:52.030
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.570
[cheers and applause continue]

18:54.570 --> 18:56.570
We've got our first fooler
of the night.

18:56.570 --> 19:00.330
Come back and see if we'll get
another after this.

19:08.670 --> 19:11.670
[jazz music]

19:12.970 --> 19:14.470
- Welcome back.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.030
Penn and Teller have barely
recovered from getting fooled,

19:17.030 --> 19:19.070
but it's already time
for the next act.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.530
Take a look.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.530
- There are, really,
only 12 notes on the piano.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.300
But there's a million
different combinations

19:26.300 --> 19:28.530
in which you can play them,
and the same goes with magic.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.070
There's only
eight effects,

19:30.070 --> 19:31.670
but, you know,
it's what you do

19:31.670 --> 19:33.330
with those eight effects.

19:33.330 --> 19:35.500
I remember back in the day,
I had nothing to say.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.600
But becoming an adult,
you have life experiences,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.070
and you have stuff
you want to say,

19:40.070 --> 19:42.230
and magic just becomes
the vehicle for that.

19:42.230 --> 19:46.100
I try to take different bits
from everything in life

19:46.100 --> 19:47.430
and put it into my magic
because, you know,

19:47.430 --> 19:49.000
that's how you connect
with the audience

19:49.000 --> 19:51.430
and make it
a really powerful experience.

19:51.430 --> 19:54.270
My brother Bruce
was two years older than me.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.130
He passed away in 2011.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.200
It put everything
into perspective.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.300
I think it really showed me
not to sweat the small stuff.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.000
We're cut from
the exact same cloth.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So I know he's looking down,
proud of me,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.170
and taking this journey
and making it into a career.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.570
You know, I feel like I can see
him with his grin on his face,

20:08.570 --> 20:11.130
being like, "Nice work."

20:11.130 --> 20:15.070
[cheers and applause]

20:15.070 --> 20:18.800
- Please welcome Winnipeg's own
Darcy Oake.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.800
[cheers and applause]

20:27.170 --> 20:28.870
- Every single
person in this room

20:28.870 --> 20:31.030
can probably remember
the very first moment

20:31.030 --> 20:33.900
they ever experienced
that feeling of real magic.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.930
And for some of you,
that might be tonight.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.330
For me, it happened when
I was six years old.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.270
I was sitting around at home,
and my dad was playing

20:40.270 --> 20:41.670
with a deck of cards.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.900
Now, my dad knows zero magic.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.770
He says, "Darcy, pick a card."
I was skeptical.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.530
So I reached into the pack,
I pulled one out.

20:48.530 --> 20:50.470
I looked at it,
I put it back inside.

20:50.470 --> 20:53.000
He said, "Without looking,
I'm gonna find your card."

20:53.000 --> 20:54.630
Sure enough he closes
his eyes,

20:54.630 --> 20:56.670
spreads the cards out
face down on the table,

20:56.670 --> 20:58.630
reaches into the pack,
pulls one out,

20:58.630 --> 20:59.730
flips it over.

20:59.730 --> 21:01.400
Lo and behold,
it was my card.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.670
I was absolutely flabbergasted.

21:03.670 --> 21:05.930
Had no idea how to explain
what I just saw.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.230
Begged him for a month
to tell me how he did it.

21:08.230 --> 21:09.430
Wouldn't tell me.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.200
Finally, five weeks later,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.630
I learned it was
a complete accident.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.830
[laughter]

21:15.830 --> 21:17.870
Just so happened to work out.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.070
But that moment changed
the course of my life forever.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.230
So right now I'd like to try
to share that moment

21:22.230 --> 21:23.470
with all of you.

21:23.470 --> 21:25.630
I've got...

21:25.630 --> 21:27.070
a bottle.

21:27.070 --> 21:29.230
The bottle...
[glass tinks]

21:29.230 --> 21:31.030
Is made of glass...

21:31.030 --> 21:33.570
completely solid,
untampered with,

21:33.570 --> 21:37.130
and the cork will remain
in the mouth of the bottle.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.000
The bottle goes in the box.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.200
The box is locked

21:41.200 --> 21:44.930
and placed inside
the larger box.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.470
Now, you can stay right there,
but, Teller,

21:48.470 --> 21:50.500
if you can me a favor and hold
on to the box for me.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.900
We'll just rest it right
on your lap.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.100
Right here,
if that's all right.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.400
Thank you very much.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.500
Penn.
- Yes, sir.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.730
- We have a deck of cards
right here.

21:58.730 --> 22:01.530
We will remove the jokers
from the pack.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.870
They'll sit right there.
Thank you very much.

22:03.870 --> 22:05.770
You can see that all
of the cards

22:05.770 --> 22:08.570
are, in fact, different--
no two are the same.

22:08.570 --> 22:10.870
What I'm gonna do in one second
is I'm gonna hand you the deck.

22:10.870 --> 22:12.970
And behind your back,
I want you to take

22:12.970 --> 22:15.200
one card out from the middle,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.230
flip it over,
put it face up on top,

22:17.230 --> 22:18.500
and then cut it into the pack.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.730
Sound good?
- Okay.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.030
- So behind your back,
take out one card,

22:22.030 --> 22:24.100
put it face up on top,
cut it into the deck.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.800
So, that way, nobody knows
what card you've selected.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.870
- So I reach anywhere I want
in the middle?

22:28.870 --> 22:30.100
- Anywhere in the middle,
pull it out--

22:30.100 --> 22:32.130
- Take out one card,
put it face up on top, right?

22:32.130 --> 22:34.130
- Don't look, Teller,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

22:34.130 --> 22:36.230
- And then I'm going to cut it
somewhere in the middle.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.570
- Exactly.

22:37.570 --> 22:39.470
- I think I have followed
all the directions properly.

22:39.470 --> 22:41.070
And there is the deck.
- I hope so. Perfect.

22:41.070 --> 22:43.630
- There should be one card
face up in the deck there.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.300
- Excellent.
We'll have a look here.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.470
If we go through, we can see--
- Now it's gonna be face down.

22:47.470 --> 22:49.330
- We can see one card
is face down,

22:49.330 --> 22:51.330
one card only.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.070
You have selected
the five of hearts.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.000
Nice choice, Penn.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.370
Watch very closely 'cause we
will do this very, very slowly.

23:00.370 --> 23:01.630
Your five of hearts--

23:01.630 --> 23:03.700
you could have selected
any card in the pack.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.370
We will take one of the jokers.

23:06.370 --> 23:09.770
And all we're gonna do
is sandwich it..

23:09.770 --> 23:12.470
right between...

23:12.470 --> 23:13.870
the jokers.

23:13.870 --> 23:17.100
Watch closely, 'cause this
will happen very quickly.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.600
You could have selected
any card in the deck.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.130
You chose the five of hearts,
which is now sandwiched

23:21.130 --> 23:23.270
between the two jokers.

23:23.270 --> 23:24.500
Here we go, watch.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.530
Give it a little shake,

23:26.530 --> 23:28.930
and it vanishes.

23:28.930 --> 23:30.270
Gone.

23:30.270 --> 23:33.270
[applause]

23:35.570 --> 23:37.770
The hands...

23:37.770 --> 23:39.600
are empty.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.700
Inside this box--
check it out--

23:41.700 --> 23:44.430
is the other box.

23:44.430 --> 23:46.700
Inside this box,

23:46.700 --> 23:49.200
have a look inside.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.130
- Whoa.
[audience gasps]

23:53.130 --> 23:55.700
[cheers and applause]

23:59.070 --> 24:01.270
- Darcy Oake!

24:01.270 --> 24:03.530
[cheers and applause]

24:03.530 --> 24:06.200
- Thank you.
- That was awesome.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.900
Oh, my goodness,
and you did it

24:07.900 --> 24:09.500
right in Teller's lap.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.230
- Risky business.
- Yeah. That's so cool.

24:12.230 --> 24:13.800
How long have
you been into magic?

24:13.800 --> 24:14.770
- Since I was a kid.

24:14.770 --> 24:15.900
Since I was about six
or seven years old.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.430
And that's actually
a true story.

24:17.430 --> 24:19.000
- Oh, since your dad, yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.230
Actually, I went
to university for one year

24:22.230 --> 24:24.600
after high school and,
obviously,

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
was failing everything
'cause I was so focused

24:26.600 --> 24:28.470
on performing
and learning magic.

24:28.470 --> 24:30.530
And I eventually learned
that if you had

24:30.530 --> 24:33.330
unpaid parking tickets,
the university

24:33.330 --> 24:35.070
wouldn't send your transcripts
to your parents.

24:35.070 --> 24:36.670
So I racked up all these
parking tickets,

24:36.670 --> 24:38.400
and they never knew
that I failed.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.200
[laughter]
It was perfect.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.370
- Oh, man, you just gave
some really bad advice

24:43.370 --> 24:45.070
to so many people.
- Yeah, yeah, I mean--

24:45.070 --> 24:46.670
[laughter]

24:46.670 --> 24:48.230
- And do you work all the time?

24:48.230 --> 24:50.370
- Yeah, I mean,
I've been pretty consistently

24:50.370 --> 24:51.630
on the road
for the past little bit.

24:51.630 --> 24:53.030
And, like, all I've
ever wanted to do is

24:53.030 --> 24:55.070
turn my passion into--
into a career.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.730
One of the highlights, I guess,
of my career so far--

24:57.730 --> 25:00.430
I got to do a show for
the Queen of England

25:00.430 --> 25:01.500
on her 90th birthday.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.100
- Wow!
- Yeah, in Windsor Castle.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.070
So that was--Yeah, yeah.
- That's incredible.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.600
- Oh, a little applause
for that.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.170
- Yeah.
That's impressive.

25:09.170 --> 25:10.870
- It was so surreal.
It was crazy.

25:10.870 --> 25:13.200
both: Yeah.
- So what's your dream gig?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.070
Or have you already done it?

25:15.070 --> 25:17.230
- Well, it's tough to say,
but I think, you know,

25:17.230 --> 25:18.600
for me, it's just
to keep performing

25:18.600 --> 25:21.270
and just being able
to do it as a job, you know?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.330
'Cause when you turn
your passion into a career,

25:23.330 --> 25:25.070
you don't work a day
in your life, right?

25:25.070 --> 25:27.400
- Exactly.
Yeah, all right.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.330
Well, let's--let's see
if the boys

25:29.330 --> 25:31.670
have figured it out.
- Let's do it.

25:31.670 --> 25:34.630
- You know, it's really
charming when we have people on

25:34.630 --> 25:38.170
that don't do magic full-time,
all the time,

25:38.170 --> 25:40.370
but it's also wonderful
to see a real pro.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.770
You just have real style,
real grace,

25:42.770 --> 25:45.530
and also,
you brought it down to us.

25:45.530 --> 25:47.700
You know, a lot of guys
try to stay as far away

25:47.700 --> 25:49.030
from us as they can.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.370
They take a little deck
of cards

25:50.370 --> 25:52.530
and say, "Penn and Teller,
I'll be at the other end

25:52.530 --> 25:54.330
"of the football field
if you need me.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.700
Watch these card moves."

25:55.700 --> 25:58.730
You brought it right
down into our laps.

25:58.730 --> 26:01.600
The selection
that I did was fabulous.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.970
That's a really, really smart,
clever way to do that,

26:04.970 --> 26:07.670
even though it
doesn't adhere

26:07.670 --> 26:10.500
to strict card table protocol.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.300
It still seems like
a completely free choice.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.670
It was great that way.

26:14.670 --> 26:18.370
Doing the joker thing,
the acrobatic thing

26:18.370 --> 26:20.900
right in Teller's face
was great.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.400
And then we also know

26:23.400 --> 26:27.470
that we've read all
the books of Robert Hartman.

26:27.470 --> 26:29.500
Is that a magic word to you
right there?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.230
- Exactly.

26:31.230 --> 26:33.070
- So you deserve a cigar
for doing a great show.

26:33.070 --> 26:35.200
- Oh, thank you.
- Great show.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.900
- Does that mean
they figured it out?

26:36.900 --> 26:39.830
- It does. Of course. Exactly.
- Well, thank you.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.570
- Thank you.
- Darcy Oake!

26:41.570 --> 26:42.930
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.870
- Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.100
[cheers and applause]

26:47.100 --> 26:50.030
- We'll be right back
with more outrageous magic,

26:50.030 --> 26:52.830
including a trick by the best
in the business--

26:52.830 --> 26:54.370
Penn and Teller!

27:02.770 --> 27:05.770
[jazz music]

27:06.870 --> 27:08.830
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

27:08.830 --> 27:11.000
Sure, we search the world
for the best magic,

27:11.000 --> 27:12.870
but we also find
great performers

27:12.870 --> 27:14.200
right in our backyard.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.000
Check out this next act.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.570
- When I first moved
to Las Vegas...

27:20.570 --> 27:22.100
it was a big risk.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.730
I was nervous.
I didn't know anybody.

27:23.730 --> 27:26.070
And I ran into
this great magician.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.100
And I said,
"Hey, you're Johnny Thompson."

27:28.100 --> 27:29.430
And he turned to me,
and he said,

27:29.430 --> 27:30.930
"Oh, you must be a magician."

27:30.930 --> 27:32.770
I showed him something
that impressed him.

27:32.770 --> 27:35.030
It confirmed that I made
the right decision

27:35.030 --> 27:36.830
moving to Las Vegas.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.300
Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee's
martial arts discipline,

27:41.300 --> 27:44.000
utilizing universal concepts,
such as fluidity,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.730
completely changed
my coin magic.

27:46.730 --> 27:49.330
Cards and coins, uh,
they can have a bad rap.

27:49.330 --> 27:50.670
A lot of the great moves

27:50.670 --> 27:52.370
were invented by charlatans
and the cheats

27:52.370 --> 27:54.070
who were trying to cheat
each other at cards.

27:54.070 --> 27:57.770
I don't let that affect
the way my magic has to be.

27:57.770 --> 28:00.070
I create my own stuff.

28:00.070 --> 28:02.330
And that's what I'll
be performing tonight.

28:02.330 --> 28:04.200
I'm gonna fool the [bleep]
out of them.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.730
[laughter]

28:06.730 --> 28:10.600
[cheers and applause]

28:10.600 --> 28:12.730
- Please welcome
the closeup magic

28:12.730 --> 28:15.070
of Alex Geiser.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.930
[applause]

28:17.930 --> 28:20.500
- Again,
my name is Alex Geiser

28:20.500 --> 28:23.630
and I cannot tell you
how excited I am to be here,

28:23.630 --> 28:25.430
because tonight I'm going
to perform

28:25.430 --> 28:28.130
one of my most amazing
compositions.

28:28.130 --> 28:31.300
And for this, would
Penn and Teller please join me?

28:31.300 --> 28:33.570
Give them a big round
of applause.

28:33.570 --> 28:36.230
[applause]

28:36.230 --> 28:38.700
Hey.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.030
Hi.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.430
Gentlemen, I'm going to be
using just a few things.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.370
These three coins.

28:44.370 --> 28:45.730
Would you check those out?

28:45.730 --> 28:49.530
And one beautiful piece
of glass.

28:49.530 --> 28:51.900
Would you check that out, too?
Thank you.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.230
And you'll notice turtles won't
cut it this time, my friend.

28:54.230 --> 28:55.800
- Okay. Okay
[laughs]

28:55.800 --> 28:58.570
- A joke for all you diehard
fans out there.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.770
- No turtles.
- I'll take those.

28:59.770 --> 29:01.270
Thank you.
Thank you.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.970
Gentlemen, if I could get you
to take this by the corners

29:03.970 --> 29:05.770
and hold it like a table.

29:05.770 --> 29:07.270
- Okay.
- Beautiful.

29:08.570 --> 29:11.070
They say all matter

29:11.070 --> 29:12.730
is made of atoms,

29:12.730 --> 29:14.730
and there's a force

29:14.730 --> 29:17.830
that binds those atoms
together.

29:17.830 --> 29:20.230
If we can manipulate
this force,

29:20.230 --> 29:24.900
perhaps we can make one object
pass right through another.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.230
So there's only a few ways
to get to the other side.

29:27.230 --> 29:30.200
One, of course,
is to go around.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.130
And the other would be to
break through,

29:33.130 --> 29:35.100
shattering the glass,

29:35.100 --> 29:37.130
but neither of those are magic.

29:37.130 --> 29:39.500
And that's why I'm going
to make it pass through

29:39.500 --> 29:41.830
and it's going to happen...

29:41.830 --> 29:43.570
right...

29:43.570 --> 29:45.670
now.

29:47.770 --> 29:50.770
[crowd gasps, applause]

29:53.330 --> 29:55.270
Teller,

29:55.270 --> 29:56.530
I could tell by
your dead silence

29:56.530 --> 29:57.630
that I've just fooled you.

29:57.630 --> 29:58.970
In that case,
I've done my job.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.600
Everybody, have a great night.
Thank you.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.530
[laughter]

30:03.530 --> 30:06.070
No.
There's two to go.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.300
And it gets more beautiful

30:08.300 --> 30:12.700
and more impossible
as we progress.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.930
So do not blink.

30:16.430 --> 30:18.200
[crowd gasping]

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
[cheers and applause]

30:25.600 --> 30:27.530
- Penn, I can tell

30:27.530 --> 30:29.270
by your stunned silence
that I've fooled you as well.

30:29.270 --> 30:30.970
- There you go.

30:30.970 --> 30:33.070
- It's one thing
if this happens in my hands,

30:33.070 --> 30:35.730
but what about yours?

30:35.730 --> 30:38.200
I brought you to the edge, and
now I'm going to push you over.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.200
So let me borrow
your left hand.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.700
Thank you.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.400
Hold that out nice and flat,
fingers straight and together,

30:44.400 --> 30:46.170
and go underneath the glass

30:46.170 --> 30:48.770
and press up against it.

30:48.770 --> 30:50.230
Perfect.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.030
The audience can see in
the front

30:53.030 --> 30:55.370
and underneath.

30:55.370 --> 30:56.730
Your hand acts like
a barrier

30:56.730 --> 30:58.770
to the empty space in
the middle.

30:58.770 --> 31:00.930
Keep hold right here for me,
please.

31:00.930 --> 31:02.130
You know what will happen,

31:02.130 --> 31:04.670
and you know where
it will happen.

31:04.670 --> 31:06.300
Just warm it up.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.100
Actually, Teller,
would you mind lowering

31:08.100 --> 31:09.130
your hand a little bit?

31:09.130 --> 31:12.430
Little more.
Perfect.

31:12.430 --> 31:13.870
One last look.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.170
And press.

31:16.170 --> 31:19.170
- [gasps and chuckles]
[laughter]

31:19.170 --> 31:20.970
- Yeah, Penn,
you can let go sir.

31:20.970 --> 31:22.700
Thank you.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.630
[cheers and applause]

31:30.070 --> 31:31.400
Thank you.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.870
- Alex Geiser!
[cheers and applause]

31:34.870 --> 31:36.770
Wow.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.470
You finally made
Penn and Teller

31:40.470 --> 31:43.400
look like--look like
I do all the time.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.230
I make that face every day.
- It's an honor, yeah.

31:46.230 --> 31:47.700
- That's incredible.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.500
And they were right here.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.270
- That's--that's how
it's got to be done.

31:51.270 --> 31:52.970
- This is gonna be good.

31:52.970 --> 31:57.100
Is this an unusual trick,
or do other magicians do it?

31:57.100 --> 31:59.130
- There are things
that are similar.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.170
They could say it's coins
through glass

32:01.170 --> 32:03.100
where people have been
using a table.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.870
But, you know,
I first thought of the idea

32:05.870 --> 32:08.630
of how cool it would be
if you just had a pane

32:08.630 --> 32:10.300
that people were holding.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.400
So you could just
as easily say, you know,

32:12.400 --> 32:13.930
it happens
in their hands, so...

32:13.930 --> 32:15.970
- Yeah. It's a great idea
to always just be able

32:15.970 --> 32:17.800
to put your table
in your suitcase, too, right?

32:17.800 --> 32:19.970
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. Yeah.

32:19.970 --> 32:21.570
- Well, let's see if
Penn and Teller

32:21.570 --> 32:22.700
could see through your trick.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.730
- Sure, yeah.
- Penn, Teller.

32:25.730 --> 32:27.830
- That is the greatest--
I mean, that's essentially

32:27.830 --> 32:30.730
coins through the table,
and you made it mean something.

32:30.730 --> 32:33.700
It's the greatest version
of that I've ever seen,

32:33.700 --> 32:35.630
and I want to just say--
[applause]

32:35.630 --> 32:37.200
- Thank you.
- That's so cool.

32:41.030 --> 32:44.270
- You had the guts
to bring us up.

32:44.270 --> 32:47.530
A lot of people who want
to fool us decide,

32:47.530 --> 32:49.500
"Well, I'll use people
from the audience,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.130
"leave them back there.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.830
"They'll be watching
a little screen,

32:52.830 --> 32:54.400
or they won't be able
to see everything."

32:54.400 --> 32:56.370
You did it right in our faces,

32:56.370 --> 32:59.330
and the guts of that,
the balls of that

32:59.330 --> 33:01.030
are unbelievable.
[laughter]

33:01.030 --> 33:03.100
I--I really, really love that.

33:03.100 --> 33:07.870
And Teller did an audible gasp
at that beginning,

33:07.870 --> 33:09.830
which is one of
the most beautiful things

33:09.830 --> 33:13.170
we've ever seen, and,
you know, at the beginning,

33:13.170 --> 33:17.130
you absolutely, 100% told
the truth about turtles.

33:17.130 --> 33:18.200
You absolutely did.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.330
It was just your
magnetic personality

33:20.330 --> 33:22.800
No turtle involved,
right through.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.930
And then, you know,
seasons change.

33:25.930 --> 33:28.070
And sometimes
is it not turtle season,

33:28.070 --> 33:30.670
then it is turtle season
a little bit later on.

33:30.670 --> 33:31.970
You know?
- Yeah.

33:31.970 --> 33:33.430
- And it came in
really nice there

33:33.430 --> 33:35.000
and all the way through.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.200
We just loved it and loved
that you had us up there

33:38.200 --> 33:39.830
and loved
that you had the guts.

33:39.830 --> 33:42.100
There was nothing
that we could see.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.300
The sleight of hand you did
was absolutely perfect,

33:45.300 --> 33:47.130
but we were able
to figure it later.

33:47.130 --> 33:50.270
Ah, that's exactly
the wrong thing to say.

33:50.270 --> 33:53.470
We were not able
to figure jack.

33:53.470 --> 33:56.000
Teller was able to figure.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.830
I finally have some sort
of inkling,

33:57.830 --> 34:00.130
but I don't think
you fooled Teller.

34:00.130 --> 34:03.630
- Did the turtle talk
make any sense to you?

34:03.630 --> 34:06.070
Or anything he said?
- Uh, yeah, that was plenty.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.500
I think they've given
me enough, so...

34:08.500 --> 34:10.300
- Aw, so you didn't fool them.
- That was a great act.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.530
- But you certainly
impressed us all.

34:12.530 --> 34:14.770
Alex Geiser.
Thank you.

34:14.770 --> 34:17.070
- Thank you.
Bye.

34:17.070 --> 34:18.770
- He was really good.

34:18.770 --> 34:21.030
That was a really good trick.

34:22.270 --> 34:25.030
- Up next,
the greatest duo in magic

34:25.030 --> 34:26.370
takes the stage.

34:26.370 --> 34:28.300
Penn and Teller perform
after this.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.630
Don't miss out.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.969
[jazz music]

34:40.969 --> 34:42.630
- Penn and Teller have made
a career

34:42.630 --> 34:45.000
making the impossible
possible.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.670
To raise the stakes
on this next illusion,

34:47.670 --> 34:49.130
they've surrounded themselves

34:49.130 --> 34:51.469
with members
of our studio audience.

34:51.469 --> 34:52.929
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:52.929 --> 34:55.900
the incredible
Penn and Teller.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.900
[applause]

34:57.900 --> 35:01.230
- You know, we started doing
magic together

35:01.230 --> 35:04.130
on the streets of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

35:04.130 --> 35:05.500
down in Headhouse Square,

35:05.500 --> 35:07.700
and we want to do
something on the street

35:07.700 --> 35:09.030
that would a look
a little bigger,

35:09.030 --> 35:10.730
like a trick you'd see
in a stage show.

35:10.730 --> 35:12.930
So we had to do this trick,

35:12.930 --> 35:14.500
but we did it with chairs
we had there

35:14.500 --> 35:16.070
with a sidewalk underneath us

35:16.070 --> 35:18.030
and also with people
all around us.

35:18.030 --> 35:20.000
So this looks like
a stage-magic trick,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.970
but it's really
a street-magic trick.

35:21.970 --> 35:26.030
And usually tricks like this
are done by claiming hypnosis.

35:26.030 --> 35:29.130
Now, we know hypnosis
is just jive.

35:29.130 --> 35:30.430
So we need someone
from the audience

35:30.430 --> 35:33.900
who will not, cannot, must not
be hypnotized.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.900
Need a woman.
How about you ma'am?

35:35.900 --> 35:37.630
Right in the aisle.
Please, right up here.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.700
How tall are you?
- 5'10"

35:39.700 --> 35:40.870
- Oh, that's a good height
for a person.

35:40.870 --> 35:41.870
Right up here.

35:41.870 --> 35:43.030
Please watch
your step here.

35:43.030 --> 35:44.830
And please come up.

35:44.830 --> 35:47.030
And what is your name,
our newest friend?

35:47.030 --> 35:48.470
- Paige.
- Paige.

35:48.470 --> 35:49.900
Hello, Paige.
This is Teller.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.070
Teller, this is Paige.

35:51.070 --> 35:53.530
Paige, take a step up on the stool,
sit on the--sit on the board

35:53.530 --> 35:54.870
facing the audience,
would you please, Paige?

35:54.870 --> 35:57.300
Now, Paige, you're not
going to be hypnotized,

35:57.300 --> 35:59.600
but they people
who are hypnotized

35:59.600 --> 36:02.630
can do things that people
who aren't hypnotized can't do,

36:02.630 --> 36:06.000
like walk on hot coals,
broken glass barefooted,

36:06.000 --> 36:10.430
lie in beds of spikes naked,
swallow fire and swords.

36:10.430 --> 36:12.170
Think hypnotism
is possible, Paige?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.530
- Of course not, Penn.
- Good.

36:13.530 --> 36:15.530
Paige, just swing your feet
around right over here.

36:15.530 --> 36:17.300
You will not be hypnotized.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.470
And lay right back
where you are,

36:18.470 --> 36:19.600
would you please, Paige?

36:19.600 --> 36:20.970
And just scoot away from me
a little bit,

36:20.970 --> 36:22.530
like, a couple inches,
yeah, beautiful.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.770
And give me the full weight
of your head in my hands.

36:24.770 --> 36:26.100
Relax your neck.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.770
Just let it fall back.
I got ya. I got ya.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.030
Now hold your hands,
Paige,

36:29.030 --> 36:32.870
as though you were holding
the sky away, okay?

36:32.870 --> 36:34.970
You're not hypnotized.
Just like that.

36:34.970 --> 36:37.270
This way if the sky
does happen to fall,

36:37.270 --> 36:39.030
you're the only one prepared.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.470
However, the much more likely
event of a nuclear holocaust,

36:42.470 --> 36:45.070
this particular hand position
will not amount to squat,

36:45.070 --> 36:48.470
but we are gonna leave
such a mysterious silhouette.

36:48.470 --> 36:49.900
Okay, Paige?
- Okay.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.830
- And Teller's gonna push back
down on your hands.

36:51.830 --> 36:53.970
When he does, push back up
against him, okay?

36:53.970 --> 36:55.870
Don't whinge. Resist.
He's a little guy, Paige.

36:55.870 --> 36:57.030
Little guy.

36:57.030 --> 36:58.730
Now, you're not hypnotized,
but just pretend

36:58.730 --> 37:00.400
the weight is still
in your hands.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.770
Keep those muscles tensed.

37:01.770 --> 37:04.000
Yeah, keep the muscles tensed.
Teller takes his hands away.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.530
Just his hands.

37:05.530 --> 37:07.230
Now, Paige, you might be
a little more comfortable

37:07.230 --> 37:08.470
would you close your eyes.

37:08.470 --> 37:10.570
This is not
for hypnosis purposes.

37:10.570 --> 37:13.800
This is so you aren't looking
directly up my nose.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.900
[laughter]

37:14.900 --> 37:16.530
Now, Paige,
think about every muscle

37:16.530 --> 37:17.770
you need to move

37:17.770 --> 37:20.170
and exactly how much
you need to move each muscle.

37:20.170 --> 37:22.330
When I say "lift,"
lift your feet

37:22.330 --> 37:24.430
three inches in the air and
hold 'em there, okay, Paige?

37:24.430 --> 37:25.970
- Okay.
- Lift.

37:25.970 --> 37:29.430
Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold.
Hold. And relax.

37:29.430 --> 37:30.500
Right back down.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.170
That is not hypnosis.
That is pilates.

37:33.170 --> 37:34.670
[laughter]

37:34.670 --> 37:36.130
Hands in position,
eyes closed,

37:36.130 --> 37:38.000
your head fall
right back here.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.430
Give me just a moment
to make your hair

37:39.430 --> 37:41.570
look really hypnotized.

37:41.570 --> 37:42.800
[laughter]

37:42.800 --> 37:45.100
Now take three deep breaths
while I count them, okay?

37:45.100 --> 37:46.800
First breath--
inhale.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.030
Hold, exhale.

37:48.030 --> 37:49.570
Second breath,
even slower, Paige.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.100
Inhale.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.670
Hold.
Exhale.

37:52.670 --> 37:55.330
Third breath, even slower.
Inhale.

37:55.330 --> 37:57.900
Hold, and exhale.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.030
Keep breathing evenly and
regularly, a little bit slower.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.470
Just think
about your breathing,

38:01.470 --> 38:02.970
that'll happen
almost automatically.

38:02.970 --> 38:04.300
Okay, Paige.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.500
Stay just the way you are.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.430
You're perfect,
don't change anything.

38:07.430 --> 38:09.170
Keep relaxed.

38:09.170 --> 38:10.830
We got your feet.
Do not lift.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.200
Do not lift yet, Paige.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.500
Not lift yet.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.900
You are not hypnotized.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.430
When I say "lift"
this time,

38:16.430 --> 38:18.370
maybe some applause
or laughter.

38:18.370 --> 38:19.870
Don't worry about
the applause or laughter.

38:19.870 --> 38:21.470
Concentrate on the weight
in your hands.

38:21.470 --> 38:23.370
Keep breathing evenly
and regularly.

38:23.370 --> 38:25.670
Okay, Paige, lift.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.400
Lift. Hold. Hold. Hold.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.200
Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.700
Hold it, Paige.
Hold it, Paige.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.070
Hold it. Hold it.

38:34.070 --> 38:36.200
Hold it, Paige.
Hold it. Hold it.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.200
Hold it.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.670
And relax, Paige.
We've got you.

38:38.670 --> 38:40.000
Relax. Stay in that position.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.500
We're gonna get the swords
and all the snakes

38:41.500 --> 38:42.670
out of the way.

38:42.670 --> 38:43.830
Right there, Paige.
Beautiful.

38:43.830 --> 38:45.770
There, Paige,
just keep relaxed.

38:47.370 --> 38:49.030
There you go, Paige.

38:49.030 --> 38:51.970
Now just sit up.

38:51.970 --> 38:55.000
And face
the audience there, Paige.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.130
Would you, please?

38:56.130 --> 39:00.030
[cheers and applause]

39:00.030 --> 39:02.870
Now, Paige, do you have
any idea what happened to you?

39:02.870 --> 39:03.870
- No.
- Then I'll tell you.

39:03.870 --> 39:05.270
I was watching.
It was boss.

39:05.270 --> 39:07.130
It was an experiment
in teleportation.

39:07.130 --> 39:08.470
You were not hypnotized.

39:08.470 --> 39:10.070
Here's a picture of you taken
two minutes ago, Paige.

39:10.070 --> 39:13.370
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- That's Paige right there.

39:13.370 --> 39:15.470
She was not hypnotized.

39:15.470 --> 39:17.200
[cheers and applause]

39:17.200 --> 39:19.600
- Oh, wow.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.430
Okay.

39:21.430 --> 39:23.300
- Not hypnotized,
not for a second.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.100
Well, we're all wrapped up
here at "Fool Us."

39:25.100 --> 39:26.430
Good night from Las Vegas

39:26.430 --> 39:29.630
where nobody is saying
good night anytime soon.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.030
Night-night.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.070
[cheers and applause]

39:33.070 --> 39:39.070
