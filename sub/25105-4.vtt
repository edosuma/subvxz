- Yep.

11:52.756 --> 11:55.488
I don't think the BCI is
the only thing he plans on stealing.

11:58.082 --> 12:01.483
I found him in the loading
dock of a company called MRL.

on a Dark Reverie site.

the avatars won't perform.

Our tech met the buyer
in one of the online groups.

The buyer gave him $50,000 in Bitcoin

13:04.935 --> 13:06.872
for the BCI and the injection.

13:06.897 --> 13:08.932

- No.
