just kind of made it sound

15:12.411 --> 15:14.496
like, like it
was an emergency.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.748
-Did I?
-Yeah.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.333
-No.
-Like, you asked
if I could

15:17.416 --> 15:18.751
cancel rehearsal.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.504
I, um, I mean,
well, I've--

15:24.131 --> 15:25.924
I've...

15:26.008 --> 15:30.846
been thinking... about us
and, and our relationship,

15:30.929 --> 15:34.516
and, um... um...

15:35.392 --> 15:36.477
(sniffs)

15:37.728 --> 15:42.024
I have a... brain disorder.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.029
What?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.323
That's the rest
of the sentence.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.831
Um, I'm confused.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.000
I think it's terminal.

16:00.084 --> 16:03.045
Y-Y-You've been thinking
a lot about our relationship

16:03.128 --> 16:06.131
because you have a, you have
a terminal brain disorder?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
Yeah, I just, like,
keep thinking, like,

16:08.133 --> 16:11.261
all the hospital visits, and...

16:11.345 --> 16:13.180
maybe, I'll have
to get out of school,

16:13.263 --> 16:14.390
stay home, you know,

16:14.473 --> 16:16.517
with the little
time I have left.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.479
-What is this terminal
brain disorder called?
-No, no, no.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.564
'Cause you're gonna google it,
and then read about it,

16:22.648 --> 16:24.900
and I'm just gonna
see it on your face.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.362
I feel like you're
l-lying to me.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.824
Lying about a terminal
brain disorder?

16:31.907 --> 16:32.825
(chuckles)

16:33.826 --> 16:35.536
That's sick.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.329
A-And to be honest,
the fact that you think

16:37.413 --> 16:39.248
I would even lie about
something that awful

16:39.331 --> 16:41.083
means there's a big problem
in this relationship,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.335
which is, like, literally
what I was trying to say
in the beginning.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.712
No, no.
In the beginning,

16:44.795 --> 16:46.922
I feel like you started
to break up with me,

16:47.005 --> 16:48.465
and then, you pivoted
to telling me that

16:48.549 --> 16:50.843
you got, like,
a terminal brain illness,

16:50.926 --> 16:53.095
and now, I feel like
you're using my skepticism

16:53.178 --> 16:55.222
as, like, a reason
to break up with me.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.683
That's your experience.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.561
No, I think...
that's the experience.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.230
-It's your experience
of the experience--
-Waitress: Hi.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.899
Kat, you don't wanna be
in a relationship with me.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.026
And I get it.
If it's okay, just say it.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.695
Just have, like,
the courage to
actually be honest

17:09.778 --> 17:10.863
'cause what you're
doin' right now,

17:10.946 --> 17:12.448
it's just, like--
feels like shit.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.409
I knew it.
I-- Wow.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.911
Wow, I can't believe this.
You're literally trying
to break up with me.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.080
No, I'm, I'm trying to help
you say what you wanna say.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
Is this some
sort of, like,

17:21.331 --> 17:22.666
manipulation tactic you learned

17:22.750 --> 17:24.626
on some fucking
incel Reddit forum?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.212
God, this is the problem
with guys like you.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.714
I tell you I'm sick,

17:28.797 --> 17:31.633
-and you just
dismiss my experience.
-Mm.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.136
Yeah, you just gaslight me,
tell me how to feel

17:34.219 --> 17:36.764
-all because I don't
meet your expectations.
-All right, well, you're right.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.140
You didn't live up
to my expectations

17:38.223 --> 17:40.976
because I did expect you
to at least be honest.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.854
-I am being honest.
-All right, I don't even
think you believe that,

17:43.937 --> 17:45.272
but, you know,
that's besides the point

17:45.355 --> 17:46.899
'cause I think we
need to break up.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.442
Wow.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.778
Wow, wow.
I didn't see that one coming.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.321
Hm. (chuckles)

17:53.781 --> 17:55.073
I didn't either.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.786
Bye!

18:03.624 --> 18:06.043
Lex...

18:06.126 --> 18:08.712
Hon, take these in the back
and hide 'em in the bushes.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.423
You really think
she's gonna stab herself?

18:11.507 --> 18:14.718
Your sister's
very emotional...
Yes.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.807
-Really?
-In the bushes, now.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.058
Go!

18:21.975 --> 18:23.060
Hurry!

18:24.061 --> 18:27.147
(unsettling music playing)

18:33.779 --> 18:34.947
(Suze sighs)

18:42.246 --> 18:44.832
Rue:
It was at some point while
breaking branches off a tree

18:44.915 --> 18:48.836
in order to camouflage a bucket
of kitchen knives in a bush...

18:48.919 --> 18:52.506
that Lexi started
to have second thoughts
about putting on her play.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.843
Well, you know what...

18:55.926 --> 18:58.720
what you should
put in the play...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.473
that time I beat
Nate's ass at that party.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.852
-No! Oh god.
-(laughing)

19:04.935 --> 19:07.062
I don't know.
Cassie isn't doing too well.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.397
I'm worried that...

19:08.480 --> 19:11.024
she's gonna see the play,
and then, she's gonna...

19:11.108 --> 19:12.568
freak out.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.361
Yeah, I mean...

19:15.946 --> 19:18.490
everybody gets
their feelings hurt.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.033
-You know?
-Yeah.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.994
Some people...

19:22.077 --> 19:25.330
some people need
to get their feelings
hurt sometimes.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.040
-(chuckles)
-Yeah... I--

19:27.124 --> 19:28.542
It's, like,
the first time in my life

19:28.625 --> 19:30.878
I'm doing something for myself.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.004
Shit.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.425
What exactly is...
the idea behind the play?

19:36.508 --> 19:40.596
I don't know, it's...
it's, like, about
a group of girlfriends

19:40.679 --> 19:42.014
who sort of...

19:43.307 --> 19:45.267
grow up and grow apart.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.185
Damn, so it's
kinda like, uh,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.856
-"Stand By Me" vibes.
-Yes, exactly!

19:50.939 --> 19:54.651
-I love that movie.
That's... exactly it.
-Hell yeah.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.905
Come on now.
I've watched that
film, like, 50 times.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.325
-Have you really?
-That's my shit, come on.

20:01.408 --> 20:06.830
In fact, my, my grandma
has it on DVD, you know?

20:08.081 --> 20:09.625
Should we watch it?

20:09.708 --> 20:12.461
♪ I've got, you've got... ♪

20:12.544 --> 20:13.837
Rue:
Lexi needed a break.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.048
♪ Skeletons in the closet,
my dear ♪

20:16.131 --> 20:19.259
Cassie...
can I use the bathroom?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.178
Cassie:
No.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.221
-(line ringing)
-Nate (on voicemail):
Yo, this is Nate.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.891
I'm busy.
Leave a message
at the beep.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.101
-(beeps)
-(line ringing)

20:28.185 --> 20:30.145
Nate (on voicemail):
Yo, this is Nate.
I'm busy.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.064
Leave a message
at the beep.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.067
(line ringing)

20:35.150 --> 20:37.945
Whatever you do,
don't marry anyone
you meet in high school.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.780
(both chuckling)

20:39.863 --> 20:42.741
I mean it.
I used to be fun.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.159
And I know you
don't believe me,

20:44.242 --> 20:46.286
-but I was fuckin' hot.
-No, I believe you.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.206
Yeah, well, could've
had anything I wanted.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.211
Then I just...
fell in love with your dad.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.922
-Well, I'm very happy he's gone.
-Yeah.

20:58.548 --> 21:02.511
Do me a favor.
Just... don't take
your anger out on me.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.721
Why would I be
angry at you?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.181
'Cause you're
an angry guy.

21:06.264 --> 21:07.808
No, I was angry at Dad.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.477
That's very different than,
you know, being angry.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.355
Okay...
Whatever you say.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.773
And I feel like
when I was angry,

21:14.856 --> 21:16.817
I had a pretty good
reason to be angry.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.902
Okay, look,
I'm not, I'm not
saying angry people

21:18.986 --> 21:21.905
don't have a reason
to be angry. Right?
You hated your father.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.366
-That's as good a reason as any.
-Yeah, but that's my point.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.826
My anger was
directed toward him.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.160
It's not just towards anyone.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.328
Yeah, I don't
know about that.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.163
No, it's not.
It's fuckin' specific.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.832
Okay, look...

21:31.915 --> 21:33.667
can we just have
a nice time?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.378
Yeah?

21:36.461 --> 21:39.089
-Yeah.
-Okay, thank you.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.885
(Marsha humming)
Need another bottle.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.345
Cassie:
I'm not the bad guy.

21:45.429 --> 21:48.056
Everyone keeps looking at me
like I'm the bad guy,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.725
but I'm not
the bad guy!

21:49.808 --> 21:52.644
-Well, you're not the good guy.
-Yeah, that's for sure.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.521
Everyone thinks that
I was hooking up with Nate

21:54.604 --> 21:56.106
when he and Maddy
were still together,

21:56.189 --> 21:58.567
but that's not accurate.
There was no crossover.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.320
Cassie, please,
just a little bit
of peace, please.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.697
Cassie:
But Rue made it sound like

22:03.780 --> 22:05.282
we were just hooking up
the entire time,

22:05.365 --> 22:07.492
but I would never do that
to someone I love.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.370
Yeah, I don't think that's
a real airtight defense.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.915
-It's the truth!
-Suze: Oh, Cassie,
you're driving me nuts!

22:13.999 --> 22:15.375
It's one thing
to do what you did,

22:15.459 --> 22:17.586
and it's another thing
to pretend you're all innocent,

22:17.669 --> 22:20.088
-and it's no big deal.
-I'm just pointing
out the facts.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.133
-Well, I'm pointing out
the principle.
-What principle?

22:23.216 --> 22:25.552
The "don't fuck
your best friend's
boyfriend" principle.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.763
That is what I am
trying to tell you, Mom!

22:27.846 --> 22:31.183
-They weren't boyfriend
and girlfriend, god!
-I don't care!

22:31.266 --> 22:33.769
I just wanna watch my
"Millionaire Matchmaker"

22:33.852 --> 22:35.353
in peace for one hour,

22:35.437 --> 22:37.272
one goddamn hour!

22:37.814 --> 22:39.149
Fuck!

22:39.232 --> 22:42.569
You, uh, you still
seein' that, that,
that blonde girl?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.906
-Why?
-Mm, 'cause I prefer
her to Maddy.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.325
Well, you're in luck.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.410
So, so you're dating?

22:50.494 --> 22:53.497
No, I just mean Maddy's never
gonna fuckin' talk to me again.

22:53.580 --> 22:58.251
-Oh, well, that's good.
-Well, we'll see.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.463
I was, I was just
terrified you were
gonna get her pregnant.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.131
-Who? Maddy?
-(scoffs)

23:03.215 --> 23:05.884
She's the type
that would keep it
just to spite you.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.219
Thank you.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.096
Can't really picture
her being a mom.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.972
Ooh, man, I could.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.557
Especially if it meant
she had the chance

23:12.641 --> 23:14.392
to screw you over
for the rest of her life.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.811
Yeah, well, she's
not fuckin' pregnant,

23:15.894 --> 23:18.313
and she's never gonna
talk to me again.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.941
So... what about
the blonde girl?

23:22.692 --> 23:25.529
-Oh, it's complicated.
-Why?

23:25.612 --> 23:31.618
-Um, she's Maddy's best friend.
-(laughs) Shit.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.787
(both laughing)

23:34.538 --> 23:36.581
Who's the cunt now?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.041
Do you remember
when she said that?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.919
-Yes, I do remember.
-(gasps) Oh my god.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.213
I know it's not
the right thing to say...

23:43.296 --> 23:45.590
but when you grabbed her
after that, and you, like,

23:45.674 --> 23:47.884
pulled her ass off,
I was thinkin',
"That's my boy."

23:47.968 --> 23:51.012
Huh? "Stickin' up
for his mama."
(kisses)

23:51.096 --> 23:54.391
Oh my gosh.
(laughs) Shit.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.185
-Yeah, it was a pretty
insane thing to do.
-I know, well,

23:57.269 --> 24:00.397
you know, you didn't
have to go so far
as to choke her.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.734
-I didn't choke her.
-Mmm.

24:04.818 --> 24:08.405
-Mom, they dropped the charges.
-Okay.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.198
-I didn't fuckin' choke her.
-Look...

24:10.282 --> 24:12.117
at that moment,
I, I wanted to choke
the girl, too.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.870
-Yeah, but my point is
I didn't fucking choke her, Mom.
-Okay!

24:14.953 --> 24:17.330
Don't get so upset that
ya end up chokin' me.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.915
'Cause I won't
drop the charges.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.168
I'll fuckin' clean house.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.004
(chuckles)

24:25.088 --> 24:25.839
Sorry.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.258
(Cassie screaming)

24:28.341 --> 24:29.634
What's going on?

24:32.971 --> 24:36.141
(cries)
I just wanna die!

24:37.309 --> 24:40.312
Well, a corkscrew
ain't gonna cut it.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.063
(cries) No...

24:43.231 --> 24:44.482
I told you.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.405
I don't understand.
I thought you hated Nate.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.199
When I didn't know him.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.701
You've literally
known him forever.

24:55.368 --> 24:58.496
Not like I do now.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.875
-Wait, is this why
you ratted on Fezco?
-Cassie: No.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.543
Oh my god.
That's why you did it?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.086
-No!
-That's why you said something?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.589
-'Cause you were
sleeping with him?
-No, I wasn't!

25:07.672 --> 25:10.342
Oh really?
When did you start
sleeping together?

25:10.425 --> 25:11.468
Uh...

25:11.551 --> 25:13.762
Uh... I, I don't, I don't
know the exact date.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.181
Okay, well, was it before
or after New Year's?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.475
-I don't know!
-Okay, but for someone
who's so obsessed with

25:18.558 --> 25:20.519
windows of time,
I find that hard
to believe.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.729
God, Lexi, you are
making me feel worse!

25:22.812 --> 25:24.356
Do you even know why
Fezco did what he did?

25:24.439 --> 25:27.734
-No, do you?!
-Yeah, I do.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.695
-Then tell me.
-No, I'm not gonna tell you
because you'll tell Nate.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.823
-I don't fuckin' trust you.
-No one does!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.951
Yeah, 'cause you fell
in love with someone
who spent years

25:36.034 --> 25:38.954
making fun of you.
It's sad.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.999
Nate:
Did you know Dad
was cheating on you?

25:44.584 --> 25:45.794
Did you?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.588
No.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.550
I don't, I don't believe
that for a second

25:52.634 --> 25:54.511
because when
he came in here

25:54.594 --> 25:57.097
and he was ranting
and raving about

25:57.180 --> 25:58.515
bein' a man,
and markin' his territory--

25:58.598 --> 26:01.476
I don't know,
whatever the fuck
he was talking about.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.646
(sighs)
I looked at Aaron
and I looked at you,

26:04.729 --> 26:06.982
and, boy, was
there a difference

26:07.065 --> 26:08.483
in his response
and your response.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.111
It's because Aaron
is a fucking idiot.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.408
(chuckles)
Okay, he is, isn't he?

26:16.491 --> 26:18.451
That's terrible.
I'm laughing.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.288
-(sighs)
-(both laughing)

26:23.456 --> 26:25.125
Oh... You know what?

26:25.208 --> 26:27.627
I think I'm gonna
buy a Peloton.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.463
-Yeah, I am gonna start dating.
-You're a drunk.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.215
Mm, what?
You don't want a stepfather?

26:32.299 --> 26:33.842
-Mom, shut up.
-No? Ooh, ooh!

26:33.925 --> 26:35.760
-What about one who's your age?
That'd be fun.
-Shut the fuck up.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.971
You're acting like
a fuckin' teenager.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.515
-Jesus fuckin' Christ.
-Wow!

26:40.598 --> 26:43.351
Why is it, why is it
that you only have

26:43.435 --> 26:46.187
the bad qualities
of your father,

26:46.271 --> 26:49.024
-and none of the good qualities?
-Okay.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.276
Right, so Cal, Cal's
a fuckin' saint now.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.194
No. That's, that's,
that's not what I said.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.988
That's literally
what you fuckin' said.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.240
Marsha:
No, it's not. I just--

26:59.409 --> 27:02.620
He's deeply flawed,
and somehow...

27:02.704 --> 27:07.000
somehow, some way,
we raised a child who's
even more deeply flawed.

27:08.626 --> 27:11.004
Do you ever
wonder about that?
Do you just like--

27:11.087 --> 27:13.340
What went wrong?
Do you ever
think about that?

27:13.423 --> 27:14.507
No, of course, you don't

27:14.591 --> 27:16.343
because your fuckin'
dumb-ass dad

27:16.426 --> 27:19.512
didn't believe
in therapy, so...

27:19.596 --> 27:22.432
self-reflection's
off the table. It's just--

27:24.893 --> 27:27.645
It's just a mystery to me.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.315
'Cause you were such
a sweet little baby.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.694
I remember you used to come
to our bedroom at night,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.363
and you would,
you would ask me

27:36.446 --> 27:38.198
if I wanted
anything to drink,

27:38.281 --> 27:41.117
you know, before bed,
and sometimes I'd say,

27:41.201 --> 27:42.869
"Yeah," you know,
"I want a glass of water,"

27:42.952 --> 27:45.038
just to see if you'd,
if you'd do it,

27:45.121 --> 27:47.082
if you meant it,
and you did.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.542
Hm, you'd bring it up, right?

27:49.626 --> 27:51.336
You'd put it
on the nightstand,

27:51.419 --> 27:54.130
and then,
you'd give me
a little kiss,

27:54.214 --> 27:55.965
and you'd tell me
you loved me.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.300
Then you'd look
over at your dad,

27:57.384 --> 27:59.886
and... you'd tell him
you loved him, too,

27:59.969 --> 28:01.930
but without the kiss.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.601
And then... I don't know,
somewhere, like, around...

28:07.727 --> 28:10.563
eight or nine, you just,
you-you darkened.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.942
Do you remember
those years?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.571
-Not really, no.
-God, I used to ask your dad,

28:18.655 --> 28:21.408
I was like,
"Did a baseball
hit him in the head?

28:21.491 --> 28:23.201
"Did he get a concussion?
Did something happen?

28:23.284 --> 28:24.577
I just--
I don't understand."

28:24.661 --> 28:26.663
It was such
a drastic change,
and I, I swear--

28:26.746 --> 28:28.623
What's the fucking point?
What's the point of all this?

28:28.706 --> 28:30.708
Look, I'm just--
I'm just tryin' to figure out

28:30.792 --> 28:33.545
how things ended up
the way they ended up.
That's all.

28:35.755 --> 28:39.050
I feel like you're
tryin' to say something
without sayin' it.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.638
I-I'm not.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.602
Just... forget I--

28:52.856 --> 28:54.190
(Marsha sighs)

28:57.026 --> 28:59.112
(TV playing)

29:03.158 --> 29:05.869
Who said Nate was
a bad person? Rue?

29:05.952 --> 29:07.203
It doesn't matter.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.788
'Cause if we wanna
talk about people,

29:08.872 --> 29:11.749
-let's talk about Rue.
-Rue's a good girl.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.126
Cassie:
And I'm not?

29:13.209 --> 29:14.961
I didn't say you're
not a good girl.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.464
Rue's had
a very hard life.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.717
Not harder than my life
or Lexi's life.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.844
-Suze: It's different.
-Right.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.847
Her dad died
and ours just
stopped calling.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.765
I don't know
which is worse.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.185
And if you weren't
such a fucking loser
with no self-respect,

29:30.268 --> 29:33.563
-you'd drop her 'cause
she treats you like shit.
-Suze: Enough! Enough!

29:33.646 --> 29:36.107
What, I can't say it to her,
but you two can say it to me?!

29:36.191 --> 29:38.776
I never said you didn't
have any self-respect!

29:38.860 --> 29:41.654
You don't have to!
I can fuckin' feel it!

29:44.365 --> 29:47.452
Oh, she needs
a fucking exorcism.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.998
Rue:
The truth was,
Nate didn't give a shit

29:52.081 --> 29:54.459
about what would
happen to his dad.

29:54.542 --> 29:59.297
He did, however, care
about what happened
to his dad's business

29:59.380 --> 30:03.843
because, eventually,
that would become
Nate's business.

30:03.927 --> 30:08.056
And while he didn't know
much about real estate...

30:08.139 --> 30:12.519
he did know there wasn't
much of a market for homes
built by a pedophile.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.026
or the son of a pedophile.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.070
Even though, technically,
he wasn't a pedophile,

30:22.153 --> 30:25.073
but it's not like you
could argue that out loud.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.333
(tense music playing)

30:41.506 --> 30:43.550
(barrel clicking)

30:50.723 --> 30:53.351
Rue:
Meanwhile, Jules was at home.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.853
And she hadn't talked
to Elliot since...

30:55.937 --> 30:59.190
You know what?
Actually, I don't want to
talk about Jules and Elliot.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.818
Fuck them.
Let's go back to Maddy.

Then, there are
two King Boo's,

31:03.611 --> 31:05.530
and then,
three King Boo's.

31:05.613 --> 31:09.284
Rue:
Maddy wasn't just angry
about Nate and Cassie.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.579
She was also depressed
and heartbroken.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.583
(melancholy music playing)

31:18.501 --> 31:21.004
All the times that
Cassie consoled her,

31:21.087 --> 31:24.382
comforted her,
pretended to be
there for her...

31:26.801 --> 31:28.469

two and a half hours
of video games,

32:26.694 --> 32:29.447

what had happened

32:50.635 --> 32:53.304
But after two
glasses of wine...

-You want to hear

-What?

33:06.359 --> 33:10.029
When I was in college,
I kind of did the same thing
to one of my best friends.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.448
-You mean you were me?
-No.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.410
No, that'd be less horrible.
I, I was her.

Okay, but how
close were you?

33:39.350 --> 33:43.771
-No, don't do this to me.
-I know. I'm sorry.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.940
Why?

33:46.023 --> 33:50.611
Because he gave me just
the right amount of attention
at the wrong time.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.238
That is so depressing.

33:52.321 --> 33:56.367

I was a fucking mess
in high school...

33:56.451 --> 34:00.079
in college,
and in my 20s.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.915
The idea that there was
ever anyone in the world

34:02.999 --> 34:06.502
who... would want to
settle down and marry me

34:06.586 --> 34:08.129

-You're lying.
-No. I'm not.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.717
I was, literally,

34:12.800 --> 34:15.219
the girl that everyone
and their mothers
used to say,

34:15.303 --> 34:17.930
"No one would
ever settle down
and marry her,

34:18.014 --> 34:20.433
and God-help
whoever did."

34:20.516 --> 34:22.059
Why would
they say that?

34:22.143 --> 34:24.687
Because I was messy.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.898
Oh, and I loved to fight.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.650
See, I'm not a mess,
but I do love a fight.

-Totally underrated.

Where's the hope in that?

55:16.896 --> 55:20.692
The hope...
is what Rue has to find.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.488
(clears throat)

55:26.823 --> 55:28.783
Yeah... piece of cake.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.544
-Let Rue be Rue--
-Mm-hm.

55:39.627 --> 55:41.671
and shower that
little one with love.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.592
(softly):
She's been waitin' on it.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.307
(knocks on door)

55:53.725 --> 55:54.893
Rue:
Hey.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.897
You mind if I sleep
in your bed tonight?

55:58.980 --> 56:01.066
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Come on.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.347
I feel like I don't
know anything about
your life anymore.

56:36.851 --> 56:39.062
I'll tell you
when you get back.

56:41.314 --> 56:42.398
Okay.

56:45.485 --> 56:47.612
-Good night.
-Night.

56:53.576 --> 56:55.787
(phone buzzing)

56:55.870 --> 56:57.038
Hello?

56:58.289 --> 56:59.833
Yes, this is her.

57:02.252 --> 57:05.880
Yeah, my daughter.
She's 17 years old.

57:08.133 --> 57:12.679
(sighs)
I think opiates, hero-heroin.

57:12.762 --> 57:15.348
I think mainly just opiates.

57:18.059 --> 57:21.229
Well, I t-took her
to the emergency room
about four days ago,

57:21.312 --> 57:26.276
and... the doctor gave
her somethin' to help
with the withdrawal.

57:30.029 --> 57:33.324
But I was hopin' to bring
her in as soon as possible.

57:36.202 --> 57:39.831
But she needs to be
in an inpatient hospital.

57:46.754 --> 57:49.382
You don't understand
my daughter, okay?

57:49.465 --> 57:53.386
She's a drug addict, okay?
And she's gonna kill herself.

57:53.469 --> 57:56.389
Please, I am beggin' you,
please, okay?

57:56.472 --> 58:00.018
She needs to be
in an inpatient,
not just the detox.

58:00.101 --> 58:02.437
She needs to be
put back into rehab.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.689
No, don't.
Please listen to me.

58:04.772 --> 58:10.320
I know my daughter.
She is going to kill herself.

58:10.403 --> 58:14.115
(crying)
Please don't do this, please.
I'm begging.

58:15.783 --> 58:19.746
Please, don't do this to us.
Don't do this to us, please!

58:22.165 --> 58:24.667
(crying):
My daughter's
gonna kill herself.

58:28.338 --> 58:30.006
(Leslie sniffles, cries)
