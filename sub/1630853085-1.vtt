01:18.145 --> 01:21.048
<i>All I've ever known is the city</i>

01:21.082 --> 01:22.716
<i>since I was a boy.</i>

01:24.118 --> 01:26.020
<i>And I kind of move around,</i>

01:27.355 --> 01:29.689
<i>never too long in one place.</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:53.513
<i>I grew up on the streets.</i>

01:54.481 --> 01:56.449
<i>It's where I met my father.</i>

01:57.517 --> 01:58.953
<i>Well, that's what I called him.</i>

02:00.321 --> 02:02.522
<i>We drifted around the city.</i>

02:04.624 --> 02:06.160
<i>One morning I woke...</i>

02:08.329 --> 02:09.663
<i>He was gone...</i>

02:11.631 --> 02:14.068
<i>And I knew he was never
coming back.</i>

02:24.678 --> 02:26.914
<i>I've never known my mother.</i>

02:28.849 --> 02:32.086
<i>I found out she sold me
before I was even born.</i>

02:34.288 --> 02:35.722
<i>I don't blame her, though.</i>

02:36.756 --> 02:38.758
<i>It happens all the time.</i>

02:45.565 --> 02:47.935
<i>Typhoons in the middle
of winter.</i>

02:49.469 --> 02:51.806
<i>They say these are crazy times.</i>

02:54.408 --> 02:56.576
<i>Everyone out for themselves.</i>

03:02.116 --> 03:05.052
<i>Then one day I got
a chance to sell my soul.</i>

03:07.288 --> 03:08.788
<i>And I took it.</i>

03:26.639 --> 03:29.877
<i>To follow a man
on his last walk on earth.</i>

03:31.379 --> 03:32.512
<i>Knowing it's your hand</i>

03:32.545 --> 03:36.384
<i>that will carry out
his final act.</i>

03:36.417 --> 03:39.719
<i>Sometimes I wake in the night
and wonder what they saw...</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:43.991
<i>What they thought
in their final moment...</i>

03:45.459 --> 03:47.560
<i>Before I took it away.</i>

04:19.360 --> 04:20.660
Turn around.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.001
On your knees.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.271
<i>A life isn't worth
what it used to be...</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:08.075
<i>But it's enough to get by.</i>

06:41.268 --> 06:42.403
<i>Mother...</i>

06:44.371 --> 06:46.340
<i>If I saw you again...</i>

06:48.642 --> 06:50.411
<i>Would you remember me?</i>

06:54.982 --> 06:58.252
<i>Would you know your own eyes
looking back at you?</i>

07:01.754 --> 07:03.457
<i>Do you still think of me?</i>

07:06.493 --> 07:08.062
<i>Was it you?</i>

07:12.299 --> 07:13.766
<i>Was it you?</i>

07:18.239 --> 07:21.008
<i>Does this mystery belong to you?</i>

08:43.524 --> 08:45.592
<i>I see butterflies</i>

08:45.626 --> 08:47.294
<i>and rain.</i>

08:51.532 --> 08:53.934
<i>Visions from my childhood.</i>

08:55.602 --> 08:58.339
<i>A memory or a dream.</i>

09:02.843 --> 09:05.145
<i>Flickers from my past.</i>

09:10.918 --> 09:13.020
<i>I reach out to touch it...</i>

09:16.690 --> 09:19.193
<i>But it dissolves in the light.</i>

11:32.993 --> 11:35.262
Welcome. This way, sir.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.025
Can they see me?

12:20.607 --> 12:22.242
398.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.839
What's your name?

14:35.910 --> 14:37.678
My name is April.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.953
I am from the south of Vietnam.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.491
It's just a village.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.495
There's no money there.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.198
But it's quiet...

14:59.299 --> 15:01.368
<i>And you can still see
the moon at night.</i>

15:02.804 --> 15:04.638
<i>I like to sing.</i>

15:05.940 --> 15:07.741
<i>I like to ice skate,</i>

15:08.810 --> 15:11.278
<i>but I haven't done it
for a while.</i>

15:12.980 --> 15:13.980
No...

15:16.017 --> 15:17.885
<i>I don't have a boyfriend.</i>

15:22.656 --> 15:24.224
What's your name?

15:28.830 --> 15:30.297
Jack.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.367
Long day, Jack?

15:37.839 --> 15:38.940
Not really.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.877
What do you do?

15:44.946 --> 15:46.446
Construction.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.483
I work construction.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.756
<i>You have family, Jack?</i>

15:59.526 --> 16:01.929
I got a father but, um...

16:06.100 --> 16:07.835
Well, I never really see him.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.339
Why not?

16:14.608 --> 16:16.844
He left me when I was a kid.

16:18.913 --> 16:20.982
I tracked him down once.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.786
But I didn't bother to see him.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.423
I understand.

16:32.126 --> 16:34.394
<i>When I first got here,</i>

16:34.427 --> 16:36.496
<i>all I wanted was to go home.</i>

16:39.766 --> 16:41.668
Now I feel like...

16:43.004 --> 16:44.738
There's nothing there for me.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.343
What about your family?

16:57.285 --> 16:59.887
I don't really talk
about my family.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.060
<i>What does it mean?</i>

17:13.233 --> 17:14.667
<i>Believe.</i>

17:17.704 --> 17:18.873
Believe what?

17:22.009 --> 17:25.579
I'm sorry, I... have to leave.

17:30.952 --> 17:32.220
Goodbye.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.936
<i>You search for the distant...</i>

19:31.471 --> 19:33.707
<i>Then it hits you in the face.</i>

19:37.111 --> 19:39.013
<i>Should I be afraid?</i>

19:45.752 --> 19:47.520
<i>What magic is this?</i>

24:23.664 --> 24:26.400
No, you...
You don't have to do that.

24:31.038 --> 24:32.339
<i>Jack?</i>

24:34.708 --> 24:36.477
You remembered me.

24:37.845 --> 24:40.447
<i>I never forget a voice.</i>

24:44.518 --> 24:46.086
April.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.123
Is that your real name?

24:52.860 --> 24:54.428
Of course not.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.001
No one uses their real name.

25:04.738 --> 25:06.507
Have you eaten?

25:19.053 --> 25:21.288
Would you like to eat with me?

25:27.094 --> 25:28.195
When?

25:30.698 --> 25:32.132
Tonight.

25:39.573 --> 25:41.041
Midnight.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.179
<i>That's when I get off.</i>

25:51.318 --> 25:53.053
How will I know you?

25:56.890 --> 25:59.126
I'll be the one looking at you.

27:18.539 --> 27:20.307
Show me your hand.

27:37.658 --> 27:39.059
Your...

27:39.092 --> 27:41.462
Love line is very short.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.966
I didn't know I had one.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.502
Everyone's got one.

27:50.872 --> 27:53.006
There's just no use
for them anymore.

27:54.141 --> 27:56.043
A long life with...

27:57.244 --> 27:58.712
No love.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.984
Do you know what love is, Jack?

28:06.520 --> 28:09.756
I've only heard stories
from a long time ago.

28:16.230 --> 28:18.265
What kind of stories?

28:20.033 --> 28:22.202
Sad ones, mostly.

28:25.506 --> 28:26.507
You?

28:29.409 --> 28:31.211
I thought I did.

28:33.614 --> 28:35.249
Not anymore.

28:38.519 --> 28:40.787
What have these hands
really done?

28:42.957 --> 28:45.192
Things I shouldn't forget.

28:49.129 --> 28:51.198
Things I should regret.

28:54.969 --> 28:56.737
But you don't.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.440
Maybe one day.

29:02.977 --> 29:05.178
Or maybe it's too late.

29:10.651 --> 29:12.286
Is that what you believe?

29:27.835 --> 29:29.403
Who was it?

29:33.140 --> 29:34.641
A voice...

29:36.076 --> 29:38.211
I thought I could trust.

29:41.950 --> 29:44.117
How many times did he hurt you?

29:47.254 --> 29:49.189
Less than he wanted to.

30:25.459 --> 30:27.294
<i>What's real?</i>

30:34.167 --> 30:36.236
<i>It's getting harder to tell...</i>

30:37.270 --> 30:40.173
<i>What's real, what's not.</i>

30:41.441 --> 30:44.444
<i>Are they becoming more like us?</i>

30:44.478 --> 30:47.247
<i>Or are we becoming the machine?</i>

31:50.577 --> 31:52.245
<i>What is it?</i>

31:53.346 --> 31:55.615
<i>Does it have a heart?</i>

31:56.583 --> 31:58.285
<i>A soul?</i>

31:59.987 --> 32:01.655
<i>Do I?</i>

32:12.632 --> 32:15.803
<i>They said the machines
were meant to replace us.</i>

32:17.370 --> 32:19.606
<i>But it's cheaper
to buy your soul</i>

32:21.075 --> 32:22.844
<i>than a quantum chip.</i>

33:11.959 --> 33:15.897
The company code belongs
to a biotech corporation.

33:15.930 --> 33:17.531
Masuka industries.

33:18.632 --> 33:21.368
It's the government's
largest private donor.

33:23.037 --> 33:25.372
Its system's high grade.

33:25.405 --> 33:27.340
Impossible to hack.

33:29.143 --> 33:32.412
Its head scientist,
doctor j. Bergman,

33:32.445 --> 33:34.414
disappeared last year.

33:34.447 --> 33:37.051
He's a life extension
specialist.

33:40.054 --> 33:41.588
He's your best bet.

33:43.490 --> 33:45.725
If he's still alive.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.603
It's a pain...

34:31.806 --> 34:32.940
Right here.

34:33.908 --> 34:35.775
It's hard to breathe.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.545
Just can't get enough air.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.021
No.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.821
Doctor bergman?

38:25.940 --> 38:29.276
<i>In the
corner, between the light...</i>

38:31.778 --> 38:33.214
<i>It's closer than you think.</i>

38:34.681 --> 38:36.183
<i>Look at you.</i>

38:37.818 --> 38:40.054
<i>Regrets for the blood you spilt.</i>

38:42.423 --> 38:44.791
<i>Waiting for the truth to arrive.</i>

38:46.594 --> 38:48.996
<i>You knew it was out there.</i>

39:02.642 --> 39:04.211
Who are you?

39:29.837 --> 39:31.805
Where'd it come from?

39:32.840 --> 39:35.176
Something that was following me.

39:53.127 --> 39:54.895
How old are you?

40:01.335 --> 40:03.736
And how much can I trust you?

40:10.411 --> 40:11.912
That's what I thought.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.985
Hello?

40:52.686 --> 40:54.455
<i>Jack?</i>

40:54.488 --> 40:56.156
<i>It's me.</i>

41:00.561 --> 41:02.363
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

41:04.331 --> 41:05.798
No.

41:07.134 --> 41:09.503
<i>Would you like to eat with me?</i>

41:21.949 --> 41:24.885
I don't feel like
speaking English today.

43:57.171 --> 43:59.139
Jack.

44:00.541 --> 44:02.509
I have to go to work.

44:05.078 --> 44:07.147
Can I see you tonight?

44:11.853 --> 44:14.221
I want you to stay at my home.

45:39.039 --> 45:40.574
What do you want?

45:47.916 --> 45:49.483
You killed my brother.

46:02.496 --> 46:04.331
On your knees.

47:48.235 --> 47:49.503
What is it?

47:51.705 --> 47:54.241
<i>Nymphalis antiopa.</i>

47:54.274 --> 47:56.844
The mourning cloak butterfly.

47:58.545 --> 48:01.581
They live 30 times
the normal lifespan,

48:01.615 --> 48:04.651
but their life
is half as bright.

48:04.685 --> 48:08.622
Much of it spent
in semi-hibernation.

48:12.693 --> 48:14.929
Why did you leave
the corporation?

48:19.499 --> 48:20.499
Huh.

48:21.802 --> 48:23.336
Have a seat.

48:38.585 --> 48:40.154
Yeah...

48:40.188 --> 48:44.257
You have a very high concentration
of hormones in your blood.

48:46.027 --> 48:48.261
Adrenaline, dopamine...

48:48.295 --> 48:52.066
Serotonin, vasopressin,
oxytocin.

48:52.100 --> 48:54.936
These levels seem to be new...

48:56.070 --> 48:57.337
To your system.

48:57.370 --> 49:00.774
Seems to be affecting
your cell respiration.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.249
Show me your hand.

49:13.187 --> 49:14.755
Your open and close.

49:17.992 --> 49:23.396
Well, that stiffness is your body's
rejection of the hormone levels.

49:23.430 --> 49:26.666
Have you been
trying any new drugs?

49:29.503 --> 49:30.503
No.

49:31.505 --> 49:35.675
You recently had
any new type of experience?

49:37.044 --> 49:38.311
Like what?

49:38.345 --> 49:40.982
Oh, I don't know. Anything...

49:41.015 --> 49:42.716
Anything out of the ordinary?

49:45.820 --> 49:47.922
What about the girl?

49:51.558 --> 49:54.494
The girl in the restaurant,
how long have you known her?

49:56.063 --> 49:57.764
A few days.

49:59.466 --> 50:01.768
And how long have you had
these symptoms?

50:04.538 --> 50:06.506
About the same time.

50:18.986 --> 50:21.055
Why are they following me?

50:25.092 --> 50:27.829
Well, I can't answer
that just yet.

50:36.770 --> 50:39.773
This will take
some time to analyze.

50:41.541 --> 50:43.577
I'll need your contact.

50:44.846 --> 50:47.781
I have to warn you,
I don't have much money.

50:51.285 --> 50:52.987
I don't want your money.

50:55.189 --> 50:56.858
Then why are you helping me?

50:58.425 --> 51:00.760
You just be thankful
I've done this much.

52:39.726 --> 52:40.828
Sit.

53:53.367 --> 53:55.102
I have to get dressed.

54:40.848 --> 54:43.084
<i>Creatures of loneliness...</i>

54:44.684 --> 54:46.921

Yeah.

57:40.861 --> 57:42.363
I am, of you.

57:46.834 --> 57:48.768
Are you really?

57:53.907 --> 57:56.776
You're not really
a construction worker...

57:58.145 --> 57:59.380
Are you?

58:00.614 --> 58:02.349
I was once.

58:03.517 --> 58:05.252
A long time ago.

58:07.288 --> 58:10.524
I sweated all day
for the price of a coffee.

58:21.835 --> 58:24.938
One day I took a man's
life to save my own.

58:30.811 --> 58:33.213
It didn't seem like
a hard thing to do.

58:37.151 --> 58:39.820
So from then on,
life didn't seem so precious.

58:41.155 --> 58:42.489
Nothing did.

58:48.028 --> 58:51.165
So... are you scared of me now?

58:54.635 --> 58:56.103
No.

59:02.676 --> 59:03.844
No?

59:07.448 --> 59:09.016
Then what?

59:19.993 --> 59:21.929
I'm scared of...

59:23.864 --> 59:25.599
The things I've done.

59:28.569 --> 59:30.471
The things I've become.

59:39.713 --> 59:41.615
I'm scared that I'll...

59:43.450 --> 59:45.352
Dream about you again.

59:50.057 --> 59:52.292
And that I'll miss you...

59:53.293 --> 59:55.028
When I wake up.

01:00:11.378 --> 01:00:14.481
What do you pray for
in the darkness?

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:24.525
I...

01:00:28.495 --> 01:00:30.397
Once had a daughter.

01:00:34.334 --> 01:00:36.036
And I lost her.

01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:47.448
I pray that she's okay.

01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:53.120
And that she's healthy.

01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:08.335
I've never told anyone before.

01:01:16.643 --> 01:01:18.278
Only you.

01:03:54.035 --> 01:03:55.335
Fuck.

01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:10.818
Do you know what did it?

01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:17.859
Yeah, I know.

01:04:25.933 --> 01:04:27.835
You should go to sleep.

01:04:28.836 --> 01:04:30.805
The sun'll be up soon.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.274
I can't stay.

01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:38.545
Why?

01:04:40.781 --> 01:04:42.649
I just need to go.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.789
Tonight I didn't
take your money.

01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.860
I never bring anyone back here.

01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:56.196
Do you understand?

01:04:56.964 --> 01:04:57.964
Yes.

01:05:00.868 --> 01:05:01.969
I understand.

01:05:03.437 --> 01:05:05.940
It's not safe
for you to be near me.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:10.310
The things I've done
can come back to me.

01:05:11.712 --> 01:05:13.346
Anytime.

01:05:19.686 --> 01:05:21.588
The things you do...

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:25.292
Don't come back.

01:05:28.196 --> 01:05:30.363
They're always there.

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:33.366
Inside.

01:05:37.972 --> 01:05:40.007
That's why I can't stay.

01:05:44.879 --> 01:05:46.580
I can't help you.

01:05:51.853 --> 01:05:53.520
Help me what?

01:05:54.654 --> 01:05:56.423
Find your child.

01:06:08.568 --> 01:06:11.271
I didn't ask you to help me.

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:19.479
Did I ask for your help?

01:06:31.758 --> 01:06:34.528
She's better off
without me, anyway.

01:06:36.429 --> 01:06:38.900
I'm too selfish to be a mother.

01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:52.612
Go.

01:07:19.006 --> 01:07:21.508
<i>You could
never trust someone like me.</i>

01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:24.778
<i>I will hurt you...</i>

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.614
<i>Lie to you...</i>

01:07:29.016 --> 01:07:30.684
<i>Deceive you.</i>

01:07:34.487 --> 01:07:36.123
<i>What did I do to you?</i>

01:07:37.258 --> 01:07:39.060
<i>And you to me?</i>

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.799
<i>The lights, so bright.</i>

01:07:47.601 --> 01:07:50.604
<i>If only you were on my inside.</i>

01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.541
<i>Can you remember...</i>

01:07:55.843 --> 01:07:57.611
<i>Before the glory?</i>

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.916
<i>You buried it all,
horses and men.</i>

01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:05.485
<i>Your white blood...</i>

01:08:07.355 --> 01:08:10.057
<i>Cracks your stony veins.</i>

01:08:11.359 --> 01:08:13.660
<i>Your tomb's crumbling.</i>

01:08:15.329 --> 01:08:18.698
<i>The forever light surrounds you.</i>

01:11:08.768 --> 01:11:11.771
<i>Have you seen the moon of late?</i>

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:18.913
I caught a glimpse of it
last night. It was...

01:11:20.647 --> 01:11:22.883
Can't remember
the last time I'd seen it.

01:11:26.087 --> 01:11:27.822
I must have missed it.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:33.227
I mean, it was only briefly
visible in the haze, but...

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.730
<i>But it did remind me how
some things are still real.</i>

01:11:37.764 --> 01:11:40.700
<i>Some things are still
truly beautiful.</i>

01:11:44.405 --> 01:11:46.639
Will I sing for you, sir?

01:11:47.908 --> 01:11:51.145
No, no, no. Thank you, no.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.615
Are you lonely, sir?

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:59.686
Or do you have someone special?

01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.693
Well, we live in a city
built for machines,

01:12:06.726 --> 01:12:09.629
so I would have thought
loneliness was inevitable.

01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:13.100
Unless, of course,
the machine is what you become.

01:12:15.768 --> 01:12:18.005
I did have someone special...

01:12:20.508 --> 01:12:22.409
A very long time ago.

01:12:25.279 --> 01:12:26.981
<i>Who was it?</i>

01:12:31.784 --> 01:12:34.622
The only person I ever trusted

01:12:34.654 --> 01:12:39.759
and the only person
I couldn't let go.

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.397
Still haven't.

01:12:45.399 --> 01:12:47.434
How can I help you?

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.138
Are you looking for something?

01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:55.309
I spent my whole life
searching for something.

01:12:58.345 --> 01:13:00.047
<i>Did you find it?</i>

01:13:03.484 --> 01:13:05.085
Ah.

01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:08.088
Mm.

01:13:10.191 --> 01:13:12.092
Why did you come here?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.031
Perhaps I was curious about what
it is that attracts them,

01:13:17.064 --> 01:13:19.366
why they come to such a place.

01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:23.237
<i>I mean, what are
we all looking for?</i>

01:13:27.308 --> 01:13:28.708
I was wondering.

01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:31.011
Has your life changed...

01:13:32.046 --> 01:13:33.280
Recently?

01:13:35.715 --> 01:13:37.284
What do you mean?

01:13:41.322 --> 01:13:43.157
I mean something...

01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:46.093
You didn't see coming.

01:13:52.566 --> 01:13:54.401
What do you want?

01:13:58.839 --> 01:14:00.740
Just the truth.

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.981
You know you can't find truth
in a place like this.

01:14:08.349 --> 01:14:11.819
Well, then why do they all come
here, if they know it's a lie?

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:16.991
Because it's better
than nothing.

01:14:18.993 --> 01:14:21.262
What, even if it's not real?

01:14:24.064 --> 01:14:26.000
That thing you
can't let go of...

01:14:27.501 --> 01:14:29.136
Is it real...

01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:32.273
Or just better than nothing?

01:14:45.119 --> 01:14:47.955
It will be best for everybody

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:50.824
if you stay away from him.

01:14:52.493 --> 01:14:54.395
Stay away from who?

01:14:57.164 --> 01:14:59.400
These people are very dangerous.

01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:06.206
And you should walk away, hmm?

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.374
While you can.

01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:18.152
And, um, well...

01:15:21.722 --> 01:15:23.624
I'll say goodbye.

01:16:28.655 --> 01:16:31.492
<i>Welcome
back to new world cryogenics.</i>

01:16:31.525 --> 01:16:33.660
<i>Visiting hours finish
in a half hour.</i>

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.319
There isn't much time.
You're deteriorating quite quickly.

01:18:16.697 --> 01:18:21.903
As a child, you were part
of an experimental program

01:18:21.936 --> 01:18:25.339
at the masuka corporation

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:27.241
along with many other children.

01:18:28.642 --> 01:18:31.778
The corporation's been
following you to take you in,

01:18:31.813 --> 01:18:35.048
to conclude its experiments.

01:18:35.082 --> 01:18:39.486
Experiments
in the extension of life.

01:18:43.156 --> 01:18:47.060
Street children
were the preferred target.

01:18:48.195 --> 01:18:51.565
You were part of a hormone
restriction program

01:18:51.598 --> 01:18:54.334
which essentially
comprised of limiting

01:18:54.368 --> 01:18:56.703
the production
of certain hormones.

01:18:58.338 --> 01:19:01.441
Hormones responsible
for deep emotion.

01:19:04.012 --> 01:19:08.115
Now your body has adapted to
function without these hormones,

01:19:08.148 --> 01:19:13.253
to the extent that, when they're
reintroduced, they become toxic,

01:19:13.287 --> 01:19:16.790
which is what you
are now experiencing.

01:19:20.028 --> 01:19:23.230
I mean, some people
would envy your position.

01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:26.266
If you can remain
in good health,

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.102
it's possible
you could live long enough

01:19:29.136 --> 01:19:30.771
to have a chance
to live forever.

01:19:30.804 --> 01:19:33.440
You may never have to die.

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.718
You know, once I would have done
almost anything to have what you have.

01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:48.488
I... I did the unimaginable.

01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:52.693
I committed
the most terrible crimes...

01:19:54.294 --> 01:19:56.496
To the most vulnerable
and innocent.

01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:04.906
I'm going to attempt to wipe your
records from the corporation database,

01:20:04.939 --> 01:20:07.608
but if I fail, you'll have to
keep looking over your shoulder,

01:20:07.641 --> 01:20:10.878
because the corporation
won't stop until it has you.

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:15.349
Your only chance
is to stop seeing the girl.

01:20:23.123 --> 01:20:25.559
What if I can't
stay away from her?

01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:34.534
Well, then you will die.

01:20:51.618 --> 01:20:54.822
Looks like the storm's
going to miss us.

01:21:02.529 --> 01:21:04.197
Wish me luck.

01:21:40.034 --> 01:21:42.569
<i>That dream you had of us,</i>

01:21:44.172 --> 01:21:46.473
<i>on the mountain,
in the desert...</i>

01:21:48.341 --> 01:21:50.210
<i>Was it real?</i>

01:21:52.679 --> 01:21:54.347
<i>Yes.</i>

01:21:55.549 --> 01:21:57.919
<i>Did you really
miss me when you woke?</i>

01:21:59.252 --> 01:22:00.955
<i>Yes.</i>

01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:09.864
That day I first saw you...

01:22:12.265 --> 01:22:14.334
It was on the train.

01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:18.305
I followed you home.

01:22:20.474 --> 01:22:22.877
And I followed you to the club.

01:22:24.678 --> 01:22:27.514
I watched you pray
in the darkness.

01:22:28.883 --> 01:22:31.718
I don't know if it
was real, or a dream.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:38.291
I don't know if you are real.

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:08.388
Is this moment real?

01:23:09.991 --> 01:23:11.993
Only you can answer that.

01:23:20.433 --> 01:23:23.670
Mmm. What's it really mean?

01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:28.976
Everything.

01:23:32.947 --> 01:23:34.714
What is everything?

01:23:39.586 --> 01:23:40.822
Nothing.

01:23:59.006 --> 01:24:00.740
My whole life...

01:24:02.642 --> 01:24:05.112
I've felt like
I didn't belong anywhere.

01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:15.522
When I'm with you,
that feeling's gone.

01:24:30.704 --> 01:24:31.771
Jack.

01:24:38.045 --> 01:24:39.914
I'll be your home tonight.

01:24:44.484 --> 01:24:47.088
I'll be the one
to never forget you.

01:25:47.181 --> 01:25:50.418
<i>You know you can't trust her,</i>

01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:52.053
<i>but there's nothing you can do.</i>

01:25:55.423 --> 01:25:56.991
<i>Like the sun...</i>

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.962
<i>It devours you.</i>

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.636
<i>I see them now...</i>

01:26:12.373 --> 01:26:14.507
<i>The lost souls,</i>

01:26:14.541 --> 01:26:16.944
<i>flying at the speed of light.</i>

01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:25.820
<i>What magic is this?</i>

01:26:28.255 --> 01:26:29.656
<i>The lights...</i>

01:26:30.424 --> 01:26:32.126
<i>So bright.</i>

01:26:33.327 --> 01:26:34.929
<i>My love...</i>

01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:38.032
<i>Goodnight.</i>

01:31:34.495 --> 01:31:37.931
<i>I see butterflies and rain.</i>

01:31:40.834 --> 01:31:43.404
<i>Visions from my childhood.</i>

01:31:46.006 --> 01:31:48.942
<i>A memory or a dream?</i>

01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:53.914
<i>Flickers from my past.</i>

01:31:57.384 --> 01:31:58.952
<i>I see you...</i>

01:32:01.021 --> 01:32:03.190
<i>Hiding from the light.</i>

01:34:28.903 --> 01:34:30.637
Where is 398?

01:34:49.223 --> 01:34:50.324
Hmm.

01:37:31.052 --> 01:37:33.153
<i>Why should I be afraid?</i>

01:37:34.788 --> 01:37:36.223
<i>Mother...</i>

01:37:39.159 --> 01:37:40.527
<i>Why should you?</i>

01:37:45.732 --> 01:37:48.635
<i>For my eyes
to look back at me...</i>

01:37:49.971 --> 01:37:51.705
<i>And yours back at you.</i>

01:37:55.208 --> 01:37:57.210
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

01:37:59.013 --> 01:38:00.882
<i>For your warmth...</i>

01:38:02.616 --> 01:38:04.317
<i>Your beauty...</i>

01:38:05.752 --> 01:38:07.454
<i>Your truth.</i>

01:38:10.825 --> 01:38:12.559
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>
