WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:07.867 --> 00:11.800
Ding-dong! We are back!
(cheering)

00:11.867 --> 00:15.800
This time things are gonna be
pure crazy!

00:19.467 --> 00:21.067
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.433
Yay!

00:25.500 --> 00:27.667
Fuck off.
Divvy.

00:27.733 --> 00:28.800
Yes!

00:28.867 --> 00:31.167
(glass smashes)

00:31.233 --> 00:34.267
We're going to be the radgiest
we've ever been.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.733
(cheering)

00:36.800 --> 00:38.300
What the hell?

00:41.800 --> 00:44.233
Ah, fucking yes.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.933
Ah!
Fucking mug!

00:47.000 --> 00:49.567
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad tings.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.767
Fucking cunt!

00:52.533 --> 00:54.467
Oh, my God.

00:55.967 --> 00:57.767
This is amazing.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.000
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.067 --> 01:05.667
Cheers!
(laughter)

01:05.733 --> 01:09.000
Rang Gary, but he didn't answer.
Cos he's an ignorant fart.

01:09.067 --> 01:11.500
Anyone heard from Gaz?
I'm fighting MMA.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.500
Aaron's leaving the house
until after the fight.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.033
My back is killing me.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.533
Even though I'm dying for a
drink,
I can't go out.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.133
You're on the pull.
Scott doesn't even like us back.

01:24.867 --> 01:29.467
Marty's pulled. And I'm pissed
off.
My so-called best friend helped
him.

01:31.167 --> 01:35.400
The girl is a bullshitter.
I've had better nights, like.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.733
I should have a degree in
pulling.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.700
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.833
I'm going to tear the place up.

01:44.900 --> 01:48.133
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.967
I'm preened to perfection.

01:50.033 --> 01:52.633
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.467
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.433
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.700
The quiff's pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:17.833 --> 02:20.433
How are you feeling, Scott?
It's worse today.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.033
My back is pure fucked.
And I can't even go out.

02:23.100 --> 02:28.567
But from what I heard, all I
missed
was a bunch of divvys
squabbling.

02:28.633 --> 02:31.867
How come you're in here, though?
Nathan went pure radge.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.967
Last night Nathan upset us that
much

02:34.033 --> 02:36.267
I didn't want to stay
in the girls' room.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.533
Why the hell
would he help Marty pull?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.133
I'm not speaking to him
until he apologises.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.500
It's not the fact
that Martin pulled a girl,

02:43.567 --> 02:45.867
it's the way Nathan spoke to us.

02:45.933 --> 02:50.000
I don't believe that she's not
mad
because every time she's said
that,

02:50.067 --> 02:52.833
it's just been a load
of absolute fucking shite.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.067
Just for now,
just get on with the day. Ah.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.033
Morning, bitches.
Morning.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.400
I'm gutted you weren't out
last night.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.700
But you and Scott
had things to sort out.

03:05.767 --> 03:09.767
When I heard that Scott wasn't
going out, I decided to stay in.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.900
But it didn't go how I wanted it
to.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.900
We got in the bed and he was
like,

03:13.967 --> 03:17.033
"I can't stay in bed with you
because of my back."

03:17.100 --> 03:18.467
I feel like I got pied.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.433
Abbie can do a lot better.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.633
The only thing Scott is good for
is a drunken fumble.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.733
And you can use his bronzer.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.133
Nathan...

03:28.200 --> 03:32.267
I woke up, I don't have the
fear,
I don't regret anything that I
said.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.167
I'm still raging about last
night.
I've always been there for
Chloe.

03:36.233 --> 03:39.700
I've always had her back. But
it's starting to do my head in
now.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.667
She either apologises
or that's me and her done.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.900
(Marty) I'm upset about Chloe
and Nathan having an argument

03:49.967 --> 03:51.733
because they're best mates.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.733
I think just sort your
differences
out and move on.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.900
Are we all right?

03:55.967 --> 03:58.933
Listen,
me and you are 100 percent fine.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.333
I was angry and upset.
Not because of you.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.233
It's the way Nathan spoke to us.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.133
I wish I was telling the truth,

04:05.200 --> 04:08.833
but seeing Marty all over
another girl is absolutely shit.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.900
I just don't want him to know
that.
I'm fine with it.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.767
You're the best.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.567
Right.
I've got a good plan for today.

04:23.633 --> 04:26.467
The mood's not great in the
house
after last night.

04:26.533 --> 04:30.233
And to make matters worse,
we are two people down.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.100
So I've came up with a plan.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.933
Chloe and Marty.
Right. What we doing?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.733
I want it to be a surprise.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.233
Fuck off, tell us.
It's going to be fine.

04:40.300 --> 04:44.233
I'm happy that Sophie is taking
us out, but where is she taking
wor?

04:44.300 --> 04:46.233
Let's get ready.
What is it?

04:46.300 --> 04:49.667
You'll find out!
All right, then!

04:53.100 --> 04:54.600
Come on.
Bye!

04:54.667 --> 04:55.967
See yous later!

04:57.567 --> 05:00.533
Where is Sophie taking wor?
I'm really excited.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.500
This is the main reason
why we're going, because...

05:04.567 --> 05:05.900
(VIBRATING)

05:05.967 --> 05:07.333
Chlo.
Sorry.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.333
Some girls like to leave the
house

05:09.400 --> 05:11.667
with a nice pair of shoes
or a handbag.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.933
But no, Chloe likes to leave
with the vibrator.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.433
Put that away. You won't be
needing that where we're going.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.967
I've got a wedgie.
I've got a stiffy.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.067
I don't know much about the
country

05:25.133 --> 05:28.200
but by the looks of things
we're on a fucking farm.

05:28.267 --> 05:31.233
So, because we don't have many
people
in the house

05:31.300 --> 05:34.933
I thought that we might need
some...
ducks!

05:35.000 --> 05:38.733
Two ducks!
That one!

05:38.800 --> 05:41.833
I can't believe we're getting
two new family members.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.533
We've got to catch them first.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.633
Fucking hell,
that's a pure mish one.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.433
Grab one!
Ah! He's kicking off!

05:49.500 --> 05:51.167
(screaming)

05:51.233 --> 05:55.167
I'm like, fucking hell, come
here.
Slippery as fuck. Can't catch
it.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.933
Try to grab its pal.
I can't catch that.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.800
(shouting)
You divvy!

05:59.867 --> 06:03.100
I know why these ducks
are running away from Marty.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.533
His breath pure stinks.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.767
Next thing you know,
I've got a fucking pet duck.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.200
Marty's new bird! (laughs)

06:13.267 --> 06:15.967
Getting the ducks
has cheered up Marty and Chloe.

06:16.033 --> 06:19.200
I hope it has the same effect
on the rest of the house.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.433
Right now I think you're an
eight.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.467
If you trim the beard,
sort the brows out, solid ten.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.967
Normally am a solid ten.

06:36.267 --> 06:38.067
Everyone!

06:38.133 --> 06:40.433
This is such a big moment.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.133
Everybody is gonna be introduced
to the ducks.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.567
I can't wait to see everyone's
faces.

06:45.633 --> 06:50.133
Get ready to meet...
your new family members!

06:50.200 --> 06:53.100
I'm all for having newbies.
As long as they're birds.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.867
Ey!

06:56.933 --> 06:59.600
Are you having my life?
We got fucking ducks.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.233
We've got pets!

07:02.067 --> 07:04.100
Oh, my God, they're so pretty.

07:04.167 --> 07:07.433
The closest I've been to a duck
is down the local Chinese.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.167
But I can't wait
to take care of these two.

07:11.233 --> 07:14.867
Oh, my God. It's had a poo.
Urgh!

07:14.933 --> 07:16.967
The ducks have been here two
minutes

07:17.033 --> 07:19.567
and they're shitting
all over the place.

07:19.633 --> 07:21.833
They got comfortable very
quickly.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.600
It took me two weeks to even poo
in the toilet, let alone the
floor!

07:29.000 --> 07:32.467
Being in this house with a bad
back
is doing my napper clean in.

07:32.533 --> 07:36.833
I'm going to enjoy watching
Tweedledum and
Tweedle-fucking-divvy

07:36.900 --> 07:38.233
build this duck house.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.200
Stop it now. I've got a drill.
I might electrocute myself and
die.

07:42.267 --> 07:44.467
(laughs)

07:44.533 --> 07:46.967
Girls, get the ducks.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.500
Come on, duckies, go in your
hutch!

07:53.900 --> 07:57.567
Trying to catch these ducks
is like playing tag with Usain
Bolt.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.267
You've got nae chance.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.233
No, don't go up there, you
divvy.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.900
We won't be going anywhere
at this rate tonight.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.633
We'll still be catching ducks!

08:06.700 --> 08:09.167
(all) Yay!

08:09.233 --> 08:11.867
Told you!
Do not drop it.

08:11.933 --> 08:16.067
These ducks are going to have
the best ducky life ever.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.967
(all) Yay!

08:19.033 --> 08:22.133
(Marnie) The lads have nailed
building the shed.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.133
The girls have came up with
perfect names for the ducks.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.500
Because we haven't got
Aaron and Garry...

08:27.567 --> 08:30.433
We thought we'd name them
after them.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.366
So Gary and Aaron?
No, Squeaky and Skinny.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.933
(laughter)

08:35.000 --> 08:37.366
These names for the ducks
are pure wicked.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.366
Gaz looks like he could do with
a Yorkshire pudding

08:40.433 --> 08:43.933
and when Aaron gets pissed
he gets even more squeakier.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.067
Welcome to the club!

08:46.133 --> 08:49.467
Abbie, you're no longer
the newest member of the family.

08:49.533 --> 08:52.433
Now that Skinny and Squeaky
are in their new home,

08:52.500 --> 08:55.000
it's time for us to get ready
for our night out.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.200
(laughs)

09:04.100 --> 09:08.633
I wonder if Nathan will speak to
us.
I haven't spoken to Nathan all
day.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.000
He's not getting ready
with the girls.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.833
You both need to be
the bigger person,

09:13.900 --> 09:15.800
have a chat and sort it out.

09:15.867 --> 09:18.200
Nathan and Chloe
are being so stubborn.

09:18.267 --> 09:22.100
I think everyone needs to put
all
of their drama aside for
tonight.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.400
We want to have fun.

09:23.467 --> 09:25.500
Abbie, are you ready to go
on the pull?

09:25.567 --> 09:30.700
I could have a bit of a flirt.
Yous just have a neck on.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.633
I'm not going to be a mug
any longer for Scotty.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.367
He wouldn't wait for me,
so I'm not going to do it.

09:36.433 --> 09:37.833
I'm going on the pull.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.933
Are you pulling, Chloe?
If I see any fit lads, like.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.167
Are you on the pull, Marnie?
I'll take one for the team.

09:44.233 --> 09:47.867
I said I'm pulling
but I'm not feeling up for it.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.733
I don't think I'll find a lad
who can match Aaron.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.000
Pulling tonight!

09:52.067 --> 09:53.767
Pulling!
(both) Pulling!

09:59.767 --> 10:02.200
Did Chloe say anything about me?
No.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.367
She didn't?
Didn't to me. God.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.967
You've been friends
for a fucking long time.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.100
Yous can't let this
make yous fall out.

10:09.167 --> 10:13.167
It's so weird that I'm speaking
to
Marty about my argument with
Chloe.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.400
That just goes to show how far
me and Chloe have drifted.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.967
Not going to talk to her
tonight.
Because...

10:19.033 --> 10:21.267
I think you should.
Because it's weird.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.833
I don't care how you do it,
you've got to apologise to
Chloe.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.533
We're family in this house and
we
can't have people not speaking.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.933
I'll apologise for the way
I went about it

10:31.000 --> 10:33.633
but I won't apologise
for the things I said.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.267
Chloe has always been my best
friend.

10:36.333 --> 10:39.033
But this time, me and Marty
are getting close.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.167
Cos at least he's being honest.

10:41.233 --> 10:44.433
You look very handsome.
Thank you, darling. (laughs)

10:51.500 --> 10:55.500
(Scott) Everyone's getting
ready.
I'm foaming. My back is killing.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.133
But if I get myself away
and get it sorted

10:58.200 --> 11:02.367
then I can get back,
Scotty's rapid dick turbo time.
Yes!

11:04.300 --> 11:06.633
Are you going?
We get up to the boy's room

11:06.700 --> 11:09.267
to see if Mattress Back
is ready to go out.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.833
And he's packing his bags.
What the fuck?

11:11.900 --> 11:15.200
Mate, I'm in pain.
And I can't rest in here.

11:15.267 --> 11:18.033
I'm having a shit time
cos I can't go out.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.833
First Gaz doesn't show up,
then Aaron takes off and now
Scott?

11:21.900 --> 11:24.333
What the fuck is going on
in this house?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.000
Give us a cuddle.

11:27.067 --> 11:30.833
We're another man down. At this
rate
there's going to be no-one left.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.167
We're dropping like flies.

11:34.467 --> 11:38.733
I'm pure gutted that I'm going
home
but I know it's the best thing.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.333
I can hardly walk.
And once I've had a rest,

11:41.400 --> 11:44.233
I'll come back stronger
and a bigger dickhead.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.567
Fuck, yes. Job done.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.533
Marty definitely does lead her
on.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.600
I am foaming.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.500
You guys are in for a treat.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.300
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:05.967 --> 12:06.167
.

12:08.700 --> 12:08.900
.

12:15.733 --> 12:19.233
(shouts) Girls!
You all look very nice.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.167
We're all looking on point.

12:21.233 --> 12:25.167
Even though we're another man
down,
I'm really up for tonight.

12:25.233 --> 12:26.967
Down them.
Where's Scott?

12:27.033 --> 12:29.400
He's gone.
Gone where?

12:29.467 --> 12:31.867
Scotty's gone
and I'm actually gutted.

12:31.933 --> 12:36.700
But it's probably best.
Especially
the way things were left between
us.

12:36.767 --> 12:37.800
Cheers!

12:37.867 --> 12:40.300
Unbelievable. Now Scott's gone.

12:40.367 --> 12:43.400
If any more boys go
it'll be like a lezza-fest.

12:43.467 --> 12:45.600
But I think I'll really like
that.

12:48.633 --> 12:53.300
We get to the club and the
atmosphere
is banging. Let's have it!

13:05.833 --> 13:08.667
It feels so strange without
Aaron.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.167
But I am determined
to have a good night.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.500
I'm getting close
to Nathan and Chloe

13:20.567 --> 13:23.000
and we're getting to a small
squad.

13:23.067 --> 13:26.667
I need them to sort out their
differences for the sake of
family.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.067
Marty's trying to convince us
to talk to Nathan.

13:38.133 --> 13:41.633
But I think Nathan should come
to me. He's the one in the
wrong.

13:46.967 --> 13:49.833
Chloe and Marty
can't stay away from each other.

13:49.900 --> 13:53.933
They're like Abbie and fake tan.
It's all a bit too much.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.600
I'm so happy that Abbie
has put Scott behind her

14:01.667 --> 14:04.600
and I'm happy that she's out.
She is a right laugh.

14:15.467 --> 14:16.500
What the hell?

14:16.567 --> 14:20.200
Me and Abbie are having a chat
then Nathan pulls her away.

14:20.267 --> 14:23.167
What is going on?
Me and him are best friends.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.833
I'm going to help Abbie pull

14:35.900 --> 14:38.267
and the girl has no idea
how lucky she is.

14:38.333 --> 14:41.300
Because I'm the best wingman
in the North East.

14:51.333 --> 14:55.267
What the fuck? Could've told us
that was straight vodka.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.867
Yeah, yeah, Nathan. Step aside
and let me show you how it's
done.

15:18.967 --> 15:23.033
Fuck, yes. This neck on is
exactly
what I needed to help me

15:23.100 --> 15:25.667
try and get over Scott.
Thanks, Sophie.

15:31.033 --> 15:34.200
I am the best wingwoman ever.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.733
Marty is all over Chloe.
He definitely does lead her on.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.033
It's not all her.

15:49.433 --> 15:53.900
Marty, you little shit. You said
you weren't going to get with
Chloe.

15:53.967 --> 15:56.367
So why are you that close
to kissing her now?

16:05.333 --> 16:07.933
How have I possibly pissed you
off,
Nathan?

16:08.033 --> 16:11.833
What I'm doing tonight is what
I've done since I first walked
in.

16:18.733 --> 16:22.733
I'm fucking fuming.
I fell out with Chloe for
nothing.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.367
Martin is just as bad as she is.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.867
Nathan and Marty are both
arguing.

16:32.933 --> 16:36.400
Maybe if I stay in this curtain,
no-one will know I'm even here.

16:55.867 --> 17:00.000
I am fucking foaming. For one,
I haven't even necked on with
Chloe.

17:00.067 --> 17:03.433
And for two, Nathan needs to
mind his own fucking business.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.067
It's nothing to do with him.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.900
Tonight I've seen Marty
for his true colours.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.467
And it's made me realise even
more
that I need to talk to Chloe.

17:30.867 --> 17:34.767
I'm so happy that Nathan has
realised
that Marty flirts with me too.

17:34.833 --> 17:38.500
It's not just me. I'm more happy
that me and him are friends.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.900
I know I kicked off at Nathan,

17:52.967 --> 17:55.433
but I didn't want to lose him
as a mate.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.700
We're the only lads
and I need to sort it.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.200
Marty is never
going to get the point.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.633
Those two divvys are as bad
as each other.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.667
I'm so over this.

18:13.133 --> 18:17.467
Nathan, how's it took you 25
years
to realise

18:17.533 --> 18:21.533
that you don't get involved
in other people's business?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.233
Everyone just needs to pipe the
fuck
down and have a good night.

18:30.633 --> 18:32.767
Tonight has been absolutely
radge.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.467
Although nothing's simple
with this family,

18:35.533 --> 18:38.867
you can always guarantee that
we'll kiss and make up in the
end.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.233
I'm so happy that me and Nathan
have made up

18:47.300 --> 18:50.100
so I can get back to the house
and carry on the party!

19:01.400 --> 19:04.533
Even though it was weird
Aaron not being out,

19:04.600 --> 19:06.233
I've had a wicked night.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.433
Me and Sophie are fucked.
We're taking ourselves to bed.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.367
Come on, then.
Let's go and get changed.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.200
This night has not ended for me.

19:16.267 --> 19:18.500
Let's get in the hot tub
and play dares.

19:26.033 --> 19:28.467
Nathan is an amazing kisser.

19:28.533 --> 19:32.267
Definitely the best I've had
in this house. Sorry, Scott.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.767
Kiss Abbie? Not a problem.
You guys are in for a treat.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.733
Some girl-on-girl action.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.433
Shit. Chloe and Abbie
are pure necking on.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.967
And it's making me randy.

20:02.467 --> 20:05.500
Neck on with Nathan?
These girls think they've got
me.

20:05.567 --> 20:09.167
But little do they know,
I'll do anything for a dare.

20:09.233 --> 20:10.367
Come here, Nathan.

20:15.833 --> 20:19.633
I'm definitely way too drunk.
Also, I've got a boyfriend.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.900
So I'm going to bed
before I get in any more
trouble.

20:25.067 --> 20:29.333
This is a bit weird. But I'm not
going to turn down a dare.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.600
Tonight has been random,
to say the least.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.900
It started by me
nearly chinning Nathan

20:40.967 --> 20:42.967
and now I've been
necking on with him.

20:43.033 --> 20:47.433
Chloe and Abbie's necked on,
I've
had a three-way kiss. I am
winning.

20:53.133 --> 20:56.600
I'm sleeping in the boys' room
again
but I fancy some company.

20:56.667 --> 21:00.133
And maybe even a cuddle.
So come here, Marty.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.767
I can't wait for Aaron
to get back and cheer my Marns
up.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.767
Did you close your eyes?
No.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.233
Ah, you did!
I am changing and I don't like
it.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.100
Fucking hell, Chloe.

21:15.167 --> 21:17.200
Nathan!
I'm not getting involved.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.233
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:22.467 --> 21:22.667
.

21:25.167 --> 21:25.367
.

21:37.567 --> 21:40.700
Abbie is now a pulling machine.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.900
Last night we tried to help
Abbie
forget about Scott.

21:43.967 --> 21:47.500
Because the best way to get over
someone is to get under someone.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.900
I was feeling quite shit
about what was going on with
Scott,

21:50.967 --> 21:52.867
but now I feel like I've got
power.

21:52.933 --> 21:56.133
It's all about girl power.
You are proving it.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.367
The girls were so proud of us
for necking on.

21:59.433 --> 22:02.867
What are they going to think
when
they find out about the hot tub?

22:02.933 --> 22:06.467
Chloe and Nath were like,
"Why don't you do a three-way
kiss

22:06.533 --> 22:09.200
with Marty and Chloe?"
And I was like, "No way."

22:09.267 --> 22:13.667
And then somehow it happened.
Eurgh!

22:13.733 --> 22:16.167
I know Chloe.
And I think she used Abbie

22:16.233 --> 22:18.000
as an excuse to kiss Martin.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.333
I find that so weird.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.000
Can you imagine me having a
three-way
kiss with Aaron and Abbie?

22:24.067 --> 22:27.167
It would be weird.
Last night sounded absolutely
radge.

22:27.233 --> 22:30.967
What I'm more surprised about
is,
Chloe stayed in the boys' room.

22:31.033 --> 22:35.367
And I can imagine it's because
she wanted to be close to Marty.

22:35.433 --> 22:37.067
What the hell goes on?

22:41.200 --> 22:45.767
Eurgh, you fucking dirtbag!
I've just seen a willy!

22:45.833 --> 22:47.500
Why are you here?
I don't know.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.500
After last night, me and Chloe
are in a better place.

22:50.567 --> 22:52.400
I'm going to try to stick to my
word

22:52.467 --> 22:54.900
and stay out
of her and Marty's business.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.533
I want to look one more time.
No, man, fuck off.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.833
Eurgh.

23:05.533 --> 23:08.467
They don't snore.
I heard them snoring, I swear
down.

23:08.533 --> 23:09.800
I'm the duck's mam.

23:09.867 --> 23:12.400
So I need to check on my babies
in the morning

23:12.467 --> 23:14.733
and see how they're quacking on.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.267
How do you open that?
Hello there, whoa!

23:17.333 --> 23:20.133
Whoa!
There's fucking two eggs in
there.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.267
Oh, my God.

23:21.333 --> 23:26.000
Wait a minute. There's two eggs.
I am so proud of Squeaky and
Skinny.

23:26.067 --> 23:27.633
They're pure legends.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.767
Remember last night?
What happened?

23:30.833 --> 23:33.233
I kissed Nathan.
He necked on with Nathan.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.800
And I was watching it
and I got a bit turned on.

23:35.867 --> 23:38.467
What the hell
was going on last night?

23:38.533 --> 23:42.633
Not only did Marty, Abbie and
Chloe
have a three-way neck on,

23:42.700 --> 23:45.067
Marty kissed Nathan.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.200
Did you close your eyes?
No, I didn't.

23:47.267 --> 23:50.200
Ah, you did!
Oh!

23:50.267 --> 23:51.767
You love the cock!
No, no.

23:51.833 --> 23:54.633
He does. He loves the cock.
I'm missing the boys.

23:54.700 --> 23:58.933
I'm starting to go out and come
back
and necking on with Nathan.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.967
I am changing and I don't like
it.

24:01.033 --> 24:03.000
Do you want a look? Don't drop
it.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.333
Looks boiled.
It doesn't look real.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.967
These lot are going on
as if the duck shat gold.

24:08.033 --> 24:11.267
It's an egg, you fucking
simpletons.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.633
So I found out
a really interesting fact.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.800
All right, what?

24:15.867 --> 24:20.400
Erm, that last night, Nathan,
you kissed Marty.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.633
What?
It was the worst.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.233
I can't believe it.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.267
I'm surprised Nathan did it,
but I'm not at Marty.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.200
He'd kiss anything with a pulse.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.467
Mm.
My God, yous. That's so nice.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.433
He's in the water!
He's in the water!

24:41.500 --> 24:43.733
Oh, he's in the water as well!

24:43.800 --> 24:48.033
What's he doing?
Can you hear him? Talking to
them.

24:49.700 --> 24:50.867
Easier to handle.

24:50.933 --> 24:52.900
He's not a dick.
Yeah, he's nice.

24:52.967 --> 24:56.600
(laughter)
You've cuddled him every night!

24:56.667 --> 24:59.767
I climbed into Marty's bed
but nothing happened.

24:59.833 --> 25:03.267
I am a little bit gutted but I'm
not
going to let him know that.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.267
I just always want to be
more than just friends.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.400
I just whitey'd in the back
garden.
You what?

25:11.467 --> 25:13.600
The smell of them ducks
are ridiculous.

25:13.667 --> 25:17.067
We've been hanging around all
day
waiting to hear from Anna

25:17.133 --> 25:18.633
to see if we've got work.

25:18.700 --> 25:23.400
But sorry, boss, snooze, you
lose.
We're going out to party.

25:23.467 --> 25:26.500
We'll get really glammed up.
Come on, then.

25:26.567 --> 25:27.600
Woo!

25:27.667 --> 25:30.067
I'm going to wash my fanny.

25:38.267 --> 25:40.967
Am I doing eyes or eyebrows?
Eyelashes and brows.

25:41.033 --> 25:42.100
Right. Close.

25:42.167 --> 25:46.233
I'm buzzing for tonight cos the
family have sorted their
differences.

25:46.300 --> 25:49.000
And now all we need
is for the boys to come back

25:49.067 --> 25:51.500
and everything will be
back to normal.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.067
I'm going the extra mile.
I put four layers of foundation
on.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.933
Good, put another one on.
Just in case.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.900
Tonight I'm feeling proper sexy.
I want to stand out from the
crowd.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.900
I've got that much foundation
on,

26:07.967 --> 26:10.700
you could fill a hole in the
wall.
Like Polyfilla.

26:10.767 --> 26:14.267
Oh, yeah. Right there, darling.
(laughs)

26:17.000 --> 26:19.733
(shouting)

26:19.800 --> 26:21.567
I am buzzing for tonight.

26:21.633 --> 26:24.967
There may not be many of us,
but that means more drink for
me.

26:30.233 --> 26:33.700
(Sophie) We arrive at the club
and the place is going fucking
off.

26:33.767 --> 26:36.200
I can't wait
to get a good old drink down us.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.200
The family are on one
but I'm not feeling it.

26:51.267 --> 26:55.000
I'm really starting to miss
Aaron.
We have such a good time.

26:55.067 --> 26:56.867
Best thing for it? Get mortal.

27:04.133 --> 27:06.900
Since we've got back,
I've got close to Nathan.

27:06.967 --> 27:10.867
And I'm starting to think
he might be my best friend very
soon.

27:24.867 --> 27:27.633
Chloe and Marty
has caused me to hate Martin.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.633
Actually, he's a decent lad.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.500
And now he doesn't have any male
friends. I need to be there for
him.

27:42.533 --> 27:44.133
I am having a wicked night.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.633
And what's better,
Marty's not on the pull.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.933
So me and him
can enjoy being divvys.

27:58.467 --> 28:01.133
Everyone's having fun
apart from Marnie.

28:01.200 --> 28:05.367
She's looking drunk and lonely.
I need to find out what's going
on.

28:09.233 --> 28:12.467
Sophie knows me. I didn't think
I'd miss Aaron this much.

28:12.533 --> 28:16.933
There's obviously still
feelings.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be this
upset.

28:26.033 --> 28:29.167
Marnie's so emotional.
She's even crying.

28:29.233 --> 28:31.600
And Marnie never ever cries.

28:31.667 --> 28:35.300
I can't wait for Aaron
to get back and cheer my Marns
up.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.333
Marnie is looking really low.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.567
And I have the perfect way
to cheer her up.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.067
Is Marnie and Abbie
actually necking on?

29:13.133 --> 29:17.200
Oi! New girl! Marnie's always
been mine and always will be.

29:17.267 --> 29:19.000
I'm fucking foaming.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.167
I was feeling down

29:36.233 --> 29:39.267
but having the girls fight over
us
cheered us up.

29:39.333 --> 29:42.600
And it's taken my mind off
Aaron.
Thank fuck for the family.

29:47.967 --> 29:49.300
We're all mortal.

29:49.367 --> 29:52.667
Let's end this night on a high
and take this party home.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.300
I'm so happy that Marty
didn't pull tonight.

30:11.367 --> 30:14.867
I just can't help it. I'm always
going to have feelings for him.

30:19.967 --> 30:22.900
Whenever Chloe's mortal
she tries to neck on with us.

30:22.967 --> 30:25.867
I'm not going there because
I don't want to hurt her.

30:25.933 --> 30:28.700
But this is really
testing my willpower.

30:32.767 --> 30:34.567
I've got you.
Is there any smosh?

30:35.800 --> 30:40.600
You get yourself laid down.
I want a Sunday dinner, fuck
that.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.700
I'm the kebab woman.

30:51.267 --> 30:54.700
Even though I miss Aaron
the family have cheered us up.

30:54.767 --> 30:56.167
And I had a good night.

30:56.233 --> 30:58.767
So now I'm off to bed
with my midnight feast.

31:01.967 --> 31:03.567
I'm going to check on Marnie.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.133
I'm not moving nowhere
until I've finished this.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.333
Woo!

31:09.400 --> 31:12.500
No! Yous! I'm eating Sunday
dinner!

31:12.567 --> 31:16.100
You're sleeping by yourself.
I'm sleeping in the girls' room.

31:16.167 --> 31:20.000
I'm not having a food fight.
Not tonight. I'm going to bed.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.967
You've missed me every single
time.

31:22.033 --> 31:24.633
Nathan is a proper fucking
knacker.

31:24.700 --> 31:27.433
If no-one wants a food fight,
I'm going to bed.

31:30.633 --> 31:34.500
No, you're not. You're not
sleeping
here. Please stay next door.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.200
Stay next door, please.

31:36.267 --> 31:39.800
What the fuck is his problem?
I'm just here to keep him
company.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.900
You tried to kiss me in the
taxi.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.367
Me and you...
You tried to kiss me in the
taxi.

31:45.433 --> 31:49.100
Did I just hear that right?
Chloe tried to kiss Marty?

31:49.167 --> 31:51.233
You tried to kiss us.
Listen...

31:54.133 --> 31:55.200
Nathan!

31:55.267 --> 31:58.400
Fuck this. I'm not getting
involved.
I'm going to bed.

32:01.567 --> 32:03.967
Sod you, Marty,
I only wanted a cuddle.

32:04.033 --> 32:07.067
If you don't want one,
you can stay by yourself.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.233
I cannot wait to get to the
club.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.833
Something's got to change.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.167
Shit.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.867
I'm raging.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.533
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:32.933 --> 32:33.133
.

32:35.667 --> 32:35.867
.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.733
I'm going to speak to Marty
because I feel sorry for him.

32:55.800 --> 32:59.600
Don't be rowing about the same
shit.
We never row in the morning.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.533
Marty's alone in the boys' room.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.667
I couldn't imagine myself
being without the lasses.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.233
I'd probably grow a cock.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.367
Yous, I think I want to be sick.

33:08.433 --> 33:11.167
Bin's the other side.
I brought it to you last night.

33:11.233 --> 33:14.067
Talk about being sick,
I'm sick of that in there.

33:14.133 --> 33:15.300
What?
Them two.

33:15.367 --> 33:19.067
Last night Chloe and Marty
kept us awake with their
arguing.

33:19.133 --> 33:22.733
Then Marty called me over. I
said
I wasn't going to get involved.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.200
So why is he trying to drag us
back in?

33:25.267 --> 33:27.000
I just don't know the solution.

33:27.067 --> 33:30.433
If telling them
how everyone's feeling doesn't
work,

33:30.500 --> 33:31.800
then what is going to?

33:31.867 --> 33:35.133
I agree with Nathan.
We can't live like this much
longer.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.667
There's got to be something
that we can do to sort this shit
out.

33:39.733 --> 33:42.800
Yous, I'm not joking.
I need you to get an ambulance.

33:42.867 --> 33:45.967
Oh, God. Shut up.
Get a fucking grip. It's a
hangover.

33:47.733 --> 33:49.800
Last night you got upset.

33:49.867 --> 33:52.700
You tried to kiss me.
I didn't!

33:52.767 --> 33:54.567
Me and Chloe flirt all the time

33:54.633 --> 33:58.700
but after she tried to neck on
with
us and tried to come in my room,

33:58.767 --> 34:02.233
I think she's after a little bit
more than a cheeky chat.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.933
Let's just leave it there.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.067
I can't believe I tried to neck
on
with Marty last night.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.967
It's that quiff, man.
I just can't help myself.

34:10.033 --> 34:13.567
It's weird being here without
fucking... Gaz, Scott and Aaron.

34:13.632 --> 34:16.000
You get on really well with
everyone.

34:16.067 --> 34:19.167
There's only so much girl time
you can have. Yeah.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.533
I'm hanging. And after getting
upset
over Aaron last night,

34:30.600 --> 34:33.500
all I want to do is talk to him.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.100
Hiya. You all right?

34:36.600 --> 34:38.567
I just thought I'd give you a
call

34:38.632 --> 34:40.933
because I was missing you
a little bit.

34:45.567 --> 34:49.167
Well, I'm really excited. I
might
actually come down, you know.

34:51.632 --> 34:52.699
(laughs)

34:52.766 --> 34:56.632
Speaking to Aaron cheered us up.
He always knows how to make us
smile.

34:56.699 --> 35:00.267
And he feels the same as me.
That's just what I wanted to
hear.

35:00.333 --> 35:03.333
Right, love you lots.
Good luck, Aaron. See you soon!

35:03.400 --> 35:05.000
Bye! Bye. Bye.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.733
Oh, pretend to fuck us.
Oh-ow!

35:10.800 --> 35:11.900
Come on, let's go.

35:16.533 --> 35:18.567
Make us a drink.
What would you like?

35:18.633 --> 35:20.567
Something strong.
A cocktail.

35:20.633 --> 35:22.200
Shake it up, bitch.

35:22.267 --> 35:25.100
I'm feeling better
after speaking to Aaron.

35:25.167 --> 35:27.067
And now I'm ready to get back on
it.

35:27.133 --> 35:30.233
I'm looking forward to tonight.
Yeah, me too.

35:30.300 --> 35:33.733
But I feel like Chloe and Marty
can bring it down.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.933
I've been in this house when
this
happened with Charlotte and
Gary.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.400
And that ended really badly.

35:40.467 --> 35:43.167
I don't want to see it
between Chloe and Martin.

35:43.233 --> 35:45.933
They can't ever be in a
relationship.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.767
They don't want each other
to have anyone else.

35:48.833 --> 35:51.833
So what is the solution?
There is no solution.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.533
(glass smashes)
Ah!

35:58.133 --> 36:02.333
Tweedledum and
Tweedle-fucking-dick.
Tweedledum and Tweedletwat.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.233
Let's cheers to a good night.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.433
Yep.
Oh!

36:05.500 --> 36:09.000
Go on, Abbie!
(all) Yeah!

36:09.067 --> 36:12.233
Let's go!
Nathan's gonna suck me off!

36:12.300 --> 36:15.800
I'm buzzing for tonight.
I cannot wait to get to the
club.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.767
I can tell tonight
is going to be good.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.400
The music is bouncing.

36:40.233 --> 36:42.133
Marty's just hit his knee.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.000
That's what you get
for being a shit dancer.

36:51.433 --> 36:54.633
Marty's in pain
so it's Nurse Chloe to the
rescue.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.400
Chloe and Marty
are all over each other again.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.333
I think that we need to talk to
them
cos something's got to change.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.833
Me and Sophie need to let
Chloe and Marty know

37:09.900 --> 37:12.567
how their situation
is bringing the house down.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.700
Sophie and Marnie walked over

37:19.767 --> 37:21.933
and they're on me
about me and Chloe.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.800
I cannot be arsed with another
divvy
asking about this shit.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.467
If I kick off, it's a problem.
If I'm friends, it's a problem.

37:36.533 --> 37:40.100
If I flirt, it's a problem.
So what the hell am I supposed
to do?

37:51.167 --> 37:53.600
When are you going to start
being honest?

37:53.667 --> 37:56.200
Marty kicked you out
of the lads' bedroom.

37:56.267 --> 37:58.633
We're your friends.
We're trying to help.

38:03.467 --> 38:07.167
(Abbie) I look over and it
doesn't
look like anyone is having fun.

38:07.233 --> 38:09.600
Fuck that.
It's time to get the shots in

38:09.667 --> 38:11.333
and get this party started.

38:15.567 --> 38:18.533
I feel emotional
because I'm doing nothing wrong.

38:18.600 --> 38:23.833
Me and Marty flirt because I
fancy
him. There's nothing wrong with
that.

38:29.367 --> 38:32.600
The only time Chloe listens
is when we give her tough love.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.933
If that's what it takes,
that's what we're going to do.

38:42.933 --> 38:44.400
I'm getting ganged up on.

38:44.467 --> 38:47.400
I have no-one to have my back
in this house any more.

38:53.967 --> 38:58.133
OK. Maybe that was too much
tough love. Shit.

39:01.067 --> 39:03.700
Everyone's banging on
about me and Chloe

39:03.767 --> 39:05.800
and now she's heading for the
door.

39:05.867 --> 39:10.000
Why the fuck couldn't she ignore
them and walk away like I did?

39:14.067 --> 39:17.900
Everyone forgets that me and
Marty
have been friends for a long
time.

39:17.967 --> 39:21.167
I've got more history with him
than any boy in this house.

39:23.933 --> 39:27.733
I hate to see Chloe upset
cos she's one of my best mates.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.833
I'm going to make sure
she gets home.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.200
But this shit
has ruined my fucking night.

39:36.367 --> 39:39.733
I'm trying to have your back
but this is driving us insane.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.733
What is wrong with you?
I am there for you all the time.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.867
Oh, my God.

39:43.933 --> 39:47.100
What is it with me and Marty?
One minute we're best friends,

39:47.167 --> 39:49.433
the next we're having
a go at each other.

39:49.500 --> 39:54.333
What have I done wrong to you?
For you to go this in on us?

39:54.400 --> 39:57.933
Fuck off. You're full of shit.
Stop being a fucking victim.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.700
(Nathan) Tonight has gone west.
Chloe's stormed off.

40:08.767 --> 40:10.633
Maybe we were a little bit
harsh.

40:10.700 --> 40:14.400
I think it's best we head back
to the house and sort it all
out.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.933
Martin.
I don't care any more, man!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.733
You never care!

40:28.800 --> 40:32.500
Me and Marty were in a good
place
but then the others got
involved.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.633
Now he's turned on us
when I need him.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.167
Why does it always happen?

40:36.233 --> 40:40.633
That is the problem with me and
you!
You don't actually care!

40:40.700 --> 40:44.500
If I didn't care why would I
leave
everyone to come home with you?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.800
Why the fuck would I do that?

40:46.867 --> 40:49.733
Think about it, man,
you fucking idiot.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.500
I can't have this conversation
any more.

40:52.567 --> 40:54.367
We're going round in circles.

40:54.433 --> 40:55.767
(shouts)

41:01.467 --> 41:03.100
Get me out of here!

41:03.167 --> 41:04.633
Fucking hate this house.

41:04.700 --> 41:09.200
I can't stay in this house one
more
night. Fuck this, I'm raging.

41:11.033 --> 41:14.033
Chloe has gone fucking akka.
I'm not going out there.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.833
That divvy can do what she
wants.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.733
I've had enough of this house.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.167
I feel alone.
I've got no-one to back us up.

41:24.233 --> 41:26.933
I'm going home and I don't know
if I'm coming back.

41:44.967 --> 41:46.733
Oh.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.600
What is it?
Look.

41:48.667 --> 41:50.133
Why is that smashed?

41:50.200 --> 41:52.167
(Sophie) The house is a fucking
clip.

41:52.233 --> 41:55.000
Chloe and Marty
have obviously kicked off.

41:55.067 --> 41:57.800
This is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

41:57.867 --> 42:02.033
What happened? Mate,
there's a mirror through there.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.900
She'll get seven years' bad
luck.

42:03.967 --> 42:05.033
I know Chloe.

42:05.100 --> 42:08.400
And I know how upset she must
have been to go this apeshit.

42:08.467 --> 42:12.500
As long as she's in love with
Marty
and she isn't honest,

42:12.567 --> 42:14.300
I don't see anything changing.

42:14.367 --> 42:16.600
Horrible.
Has it been a bad one?

42:16.667 --> 42:18.800
She's gone.
She's gone?

42:18.867 --> 42:20.100
Well, she's not here.

42:20.167 --> 42:22.800
Nathan told us
that Chloe's left the house.

42:22.867 --> 42:26.433
I feel really bad. I feel like
I should have been there more.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.067
She just walked in
and started kicking off.

42:29.133 --> 42:33.200
It's cos we're finding it
frustrating
that she's not honest.

42:33.267 --> 42:37.400
Chloe's like my sister. I love
her.
But she can be a nightmare.

42:37.467 --> 42:40.567
I hope she comes back soon
cos I'm starting to worry.

42:43.900 --> 42:47.033
The first thing I want to do
when I wake up in the morning

42:47.100 --> 42:49.700
is find out where Chloe is
and make things cush.

42:49.767 --> 42:53.400
I care about her far too much
for her not to be in this house.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.333
I miss this.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.333
Being away has made us realise
how much I miss her.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.467
"I'm not happy with you."
Sorry.

43:04.533 --> 43:06.400
"You're on a drinking ban."

43:06.467 --> 43:08.100
What's going on here? Ey!

43:08.167 --> 43:09.467
Have you missed me?

43:09.533 --> 43:11.167
You're such a cute goat.

43:11.233 --> 43:14.533
I want to go out and just get
absolutely fucking walloped.

43:16.100 --> 43:18.733
I told myself
