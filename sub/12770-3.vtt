WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
â™ª OHHH OHHH OHHH â™ª

00:06.959 --> 00:08.917
He does this kind of
amazing thing with his tongue.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.166
( upbeat rock music playing )

00:10.208 --> 00:12.083
I mean, I'm, you know,
a woman in my 40s.

00:12.125 --> 00:14.917
I've had my share of sex.

00:14.959 --> 00:16.959
I've had some...

00:17.000 --> 00:20.041
pretty spectacular...

00:20.083 --> 00:21.583
You know.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.125
I've had sex, okay?

00:23.166 --> 00:26.667
But Sam is this, like...

00:26.709 --> 00:29.834
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I'm in love with him.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.041
No, I don't think it's because
I'm in love with him.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.458
You know,
I was in love with Derek.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.959
I was in love with Mark,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.041
I think,
even for a little while.

00:39.083 --> 00:41.083
No, I think...

00:42.375 --> 00:45.750
it's because
Sam's better than me.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.000
He's a better person.

00:49.583 --> 00:54.208
A genuinely good person.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.000
THERAPIST:
You don't think
you're a good person?

00:59.458 --> 01:02.417
Or maybe it's just that thing
he does with his tongue.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.750
I woke up with a hangover
this morning.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.667
Again.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.041
And I'm just...

01:17.083 --> 01:20.500
I'm over it.

01:20.542 --> 01:23.041
This has to be it.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.875
I don't know why
I was able to put together

01:24.917 --> 01:26.041
almost a decade sober,

01:26.083 --> 01:29.083
and now I can't seem to make it
past about 30 days.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.625
This program gave me a life,

01:31.667 --> 01:35.041
and now I have
a lot to lose, and, uh...

01:35.083 --> 01:37.750
So I'm not drinking today.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.291
Phew.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.208
I can't believe
it is day one again.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.125
( chuckles )

01:47.583 --> 01:49.959
I'm humiliated.

01:54.166 --> 01:58.041
I'm humiliated
that it's day one again.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.000
Um...

02:02.125 --> 02:06.083
But, you know, it's one day
at a time, and, uh...

02:06.125 --> 02:08.959
And I'm not gonna
take a drink today.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.417
Thanks.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.458
ADDISON:
Sorry that I didn't get a chance

02:17.500 --> 02:21.291
to review your case with
Dr. Reilly before the consult.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.750
He has been so amazing.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.917
He's really made me believe
having a child is possible,

02:25.959 --> 02:27.875
despite what
the other doctors said.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.875
Nina's been chasing that miracle
since her mother died last year.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.000
Well,
let's take a look.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.208
Okay.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.417
Oh. It says here you were born
without a uterus?

02:41.458 --> 02:44.333
Yeah. I have Mayer-Rokitansky-
Kuster-Hauser syndrome.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.208
It's a mouthful, right?

02:46.250 --> 02:47.959
Ha, ha. But her ovaries
are functional.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.208
That's the important part.
Right, but you understand--

02:50.250 --> 02:53.041
I mean, Dr. Reilly
explained to you

02:53.083 --> 02:54.709
that you can't
get pregnant?

02:54.750 --> 02:57.083
You have to have a uterus
to carry a child.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.041
I know. That's why Gammy
is giving me hers.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.500
Mm-hm.

03:01.542 --> 03:04.000
( dramatic theme playing )

03:10.083 --> 03:11.625
He's been waking up
a lot at night,

03:11.667 --> 03:13.625
and, uh, he's a little fussier
than usual.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.208
Mm-hm.
Any fever or runny nose?

03:16.250 --> 03:18.667
No.
But he was pulling his ear.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.875
What if he perfed his eardrum?
He could go deaf.

03:20.917 --> 03:23.875
Eardrums are fine,
and he is fine.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.041
And you are...

03:26.083 --> 03:27.250
I-- Ha, ha.

03:27.291 --> 03:31.375
Well, I, um...

03:31.417 --> 03:35.125
I may be going a teensy bit
crazy from all the mommy-ness.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.041
But it's a good crazy.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.041
I have never had
the chance really, you know,

03:39.083 --> 03:44.041
to be at home all the time
alone with my 2-year-old son.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.458
So it's a good crazy.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.208
And, you know,
then there's Pete.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.792
My husband
had a heart attack.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.583
I mean,
listen to that sentence, Coop.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.041
My husband
had a heart attack.

03:53.083 --> 03:57.458
My handsome, studly,
virile husband.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.792
You know
what I think I need?

03:59.834 --> 04:01.875
I think I need
a little perspective.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.667
You know, from people
who are doing what I'm doing.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.041
Mommies.

04:06.083 --> 04:09.041
Do you know any cool mommies
with groups? Mommy groups?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.166
Okay, first of all,
stop saying "mommy."

04:11.208 --> 04:13.583
Second, are you sure
that that's what you want?

04:13.625 --> 04:17.041
Yes, yes. I think it would be
interesting and fun, and--

04:17.083 --> 04:21.709
Come on, Cooper. Tell me
where the cool mommies are.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.041
I haven't been able to sleep
since my heart attack.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.208
I've tried everything:
meditation, self-hypnosis.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.917
You call the therapists
I recommended?

04:27.959 --> 04:30.041
Why would I waste my time
talking to a total stranger?

04:30.083 --> 04:31.709
I know you.
I trust you.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.041
I'm flattered.
You're free.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.125
( both chuckle )

04:34.166 --> 04:35.959
Pete--
Look, do you know

04:36.000 --> 04:38.250
that a third of all
quadruple bypass patients

04:38.291 --> 04:40.458
are dead within ten years?

04:40.500 --> 04:43.333
Well, those kind of numbers
would keep most people awake.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.291
Look, it's normal
to feel scared.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.625
I'm not scared.
I'm pissed.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.041
I did everything right.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.792
I never smoked,
I exercise,

04:49.834 --> 04:52.667
I cut way back on red meat
and dairy, decaf.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.041
And now I eat broccoli.
I hate broccoli.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.291
( chuckles )

04:57.333 --> 04:59.000
How's Violet
handling all this?

04:59.041 --> 05:01.709
Oh, she's terrified.
You can see it in her eyes.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.166
She thinks
I'm gonna drop dead.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.667
Your heart attack
was traumatic for her too.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.333
She'll relax
when she's convinced

05:07.375 --> 05:09.041
that the family's
no longer in crisis.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.542
When will that be?
When you find another therapist.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.750
COOPER:
Hey, can I get some of that?

05:19.375 --> 05:22.166
Really? I've apologized,
like, a thousand times.

05:22.208 --> 05:27.041
I am truly, deeply,
incredibly sorry, Charlotte.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.333
What's going on now?
I--

05:29.375 --> 05:32.041
I did a thing.
A stupid thing.

05:32.083 --> 05:36.500
Yes, a stupid thing that ended
up saving a young girl's life.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.917
And that's the very last time
I'll defend myself,

05:38.959 --> 05:41.333
but come on, Charlotte,
you can't stay mad at me.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.917
You broke into my computer

05:42.959 --> 05:45.291
and stole confidential
information.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.208
Don't bet on it.

05:51.750 --> 05:52.834
Late night?

05:52.875 --> 05:55.333
Chief of staff
and curfew police.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.834
You're a busy woman.
Good morning.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.250
Or not.

06:00.291 --> 06:03.041
Don't mind her. We're all
really happy that you're here.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.000
You promised a patient
a uterine transplant?

06:06.041 --> 06:07.458
What the hell
were you thinking?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.041
Nice welcome wagon
you got there.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.583
It can't be done.
I did work at the Mayo Clinic

06:11.625 --> 06:13.959
on the procedural viability
of uterine organ transplant.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.041
It can be done.
On animals.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.333
It has been done on a human,

06:17.375 --> 06:19.542
just not with
any long-term success.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.166
Somebody has to be the first.
Sam.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.583
JAKE:
Thank you, Sam.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.625
There is always a first.
Nina's a perfect candidate.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.875
She's young, healthy.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.583
She is grieving.
Her mother just died.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.917
She's not thinking clearly.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.709
Look, I'm in no position
to judge her motives.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.667
Where would she get the uterus?
Oh, from her gammy. Yeah.

06:34.709 --> 06:38.041
Her 66-year-old grandmother.
Who's probably not using it.

06:38.083 --> 06:41.041
It puts both women through
an unnecessary, risky surgery.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.375
Even if she survives,
Nina would be

06:42.417 --> 06:44.291
on anti-rejection meds
for months

06:44.333 --> 06:45.917
before you can do
an embryo transfer.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.041
And even then, her body
can reject the uterus,

06:48.083 --> 06:49.709
endangering her
and the fetus.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.917
What about the obvious solution?
You skip the surgery and adopt.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.667
Or you use a surrogate.
JAKE: That's not what she wants.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.458
She wants to give birth
like her mother did her.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.250
It's not my place to judge that.
It's my place

07:00.291 --> 07:02.917
to make it happen if I can,
and I can.

07:02.959 --> 07:06.458
If this works, we can advance
the science of fertility.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.542
The patient's aware of risks,
she has a donor lined up.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.959
I'll take the shot.
I think it's worth a shot.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.750
You wanna stand in her way,

07:13.792 --> 07:15.041
or do you wanna help her
make a baby

07:15.083 --> 07:17.291
and help make history
in the process?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.750
You increased your dosage
without talking to me?

07:22.792 --> 07:25.041
Well, I wasn't
thinking about you

07:25.083 --> 07:27.250
so much as I was
thinking about Eva.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.834
Eva?
She's one of my kindergartners.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.458
She's 5 years old.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.291
Things aren't so great at home
so I spend extra time with her

07:35.333 --> 07:39.709
and I was having
a real impact until...

07:39.750 --> 07:42.542
It's hard to explain Parkinson's
to a 5-year-old.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.458
My hand started tremoring,
and she was fine with that,

07:45.500 --> 07:46.583
but then the--

07:46.625 --> 07:48.041
But then,
the jerking started,

07:48.083 --> 07:50.542
and then, I froze
in front of her.

07:50.583 --> 07:54.041
And that was so scary for her.
It was just awful.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.041
So, yes,
I increased my dosage.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.041
But it seems to really
be working because,

07:58.083 --> 07:59.750
you know,
the symptoms decreased.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.041
Okay, but high doses
of your meds

08:02.083 --> 08:04.083
have been known to cause
pretty serious side effects.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.583
They affect the limbic system,
which is the area of the brain

08:06.625 --> 08:08.750
that deals with
impulse control.

08:08.792 --> 08:12.291
Have you had any impulsive
or compulsive behaviors?

08:12.333 --> 08:16.291
Gambling, risk taking,
anything out of the ordinary?

08:16.333 --> 08:19.041
Um...

08:19.083 --> 08:21.917
My husband is having
a checkup with Sam.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.125
He's probably almost done,
right?

08:25.625 --> 08:28.291
SAM:
Your cortisol levels are way up.
You're stressed.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.709
My 40-year-old wife
has Parkinson's disease.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.917
That's a little stressful.
Yeah, I know.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.959
You're doing a great job
of taking care of her.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.542
Now you gotta take
better care of yourself.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.709
You exercising?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.500
Yeah, I definitely
keep thinking about it.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.125
( both chuckle )

08:43.166 --> 08:44.333
Huh.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.333
( mysterious theme playing )

08:46.375 --> 08:48.542
Sam, what is it?
Uh...

08:48.583 --> 08:51.959
I'm sorry, Will.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.834
I got some bad news.

08:55.083 --> 08:59.166
Laura, symptoms I can help.
But I need to know.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.875
Are you having side effects?
Compulsive behavior?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.542
Sam says I have gonorrhea.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.166
I haven't had sex
with anyone but you.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.166
Can you say the same?

09:08.208 --> 09:13.333
Yes, Dr. Shepherd,
I've been having side effects.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.417
( dramatic theme playing )

09:19.041 --> 09:21.500
It started with a single dad
of one of the kids in my class.

09:21.542 --> 09:25.041
He came in for a parent-teacher
conference and he's--

09:25.083 --> 09:27.166
Um, he's very handsome.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.625
And I noticed he was looking
at my chest while I was talking.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.291
The next thing I know,
my hand is on his pants,

09:32.333 --> 09:34.250
and then in his pants,
and then we're doing it

09:34.291 --> 09:35.834
in the supply closet
in my classroom

09:35.875 --> 09:37.583
on top of the chalk
and the magic markers.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.417
Wow.
Yeah, so--

09:39.458 --> 09:41.709
I mean, it just--
It was that one time,

09:41.750 --> 09:45.458
and I swore
it will never happen again.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.583
Okay. Good.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.166
That's good.
Because we can contact him

09:49.208 --> 09:50.542
and we can have him
treated for--

09:50.583 --> 09:53.250
Then with the janitor
in his supply closet.

09:53.291 --> 09:56.458
And then with the man who came
to fix my dripping faucet.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.041
Your dripping faucet?

09:58.083 --> 10:00.625
The plumber.
Got that.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.625
And I just-- Do you think
that's where the gonorrhea--?

10:04.667 --> 10:05.959
It's hard to say.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.625
This is crazy.
This is not me.

10:07.667 --> 10:11.041
I am married to
a wonderful, wonderful man,

10:11.083 --> 10:13.291
and I can't lose him. God,
I never wanted to hurt him.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.458
I can't live with the tremors,
I can't stop grabbing--

10:15.500 --> 10:18.458
Got it. Got it.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.041
Okay, let's start with
an STD panel and an HIV test,

10:22.083 --> 10:24.959
and then we'll
take it from there.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.083
Okay.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.792
She didn't literally say
"the plumber."

10:30.834 --> 10:33.959
He fixed her leaky faucet.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.792
Think it's funny your patient
destroyed a long-term marriage

10:36.834 --> 10:39.458
with recurrent infidelity?
AMELIA: It's actually sad.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.333
And I'm hoping
her husband understands

10:41.375 --> 10:43.166
that the drugs changed
her brain chemistry,

10:43.208 --> 10:45.291
which changed
her behavior.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.083
I mean, he can't
hold it against her.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.750
( snickers )

10:48.792 --> 10:50.083
"Hold it against her."
( chuckles )

10:50.125 --> 10:52.291
Oh, stop it,
both of you.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.250
So we're saying
infidelity gets excused

10:54.291 --> 10:57.000
when drugs are involved?
In this case, yes.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.500
CHARLOTTE:
Isn't that like saying

10:58.542 --> 11:01.041
you can't blame a drunk driver
after she totals another car?

11:01.083 --> 11:04.083
A drunk driver
chooses to get wasted.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.917
Laura did not choose
Parkinson's.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.917
Will can't blame her
for side effects.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.041
SHELDON:
That doesn't change she was
fooling around with other men.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.834
And you're asking him
to suck it up.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.709
Heh. "Suck it up."

11:15.750 --> 11:17.500
( chuckling )

11:17.542 --> 11:19.041
AMELIA:
Will is devoted to Laura.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.333
And I think
I can save the marriage.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.291
How?
Deep brain stimulation.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.792
Why do you always wanna do DBS?
Because it works.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.333
I stimulate the brain, the
Parkinson's symptoms decrease,

11:29.375 --> 11:31.125
and the pornography
is relegated

11:31.166 --> 11:33.792
to Laura and Will's
television set.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.041
DBS is my magic wand.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.041
( chuckling )

11:38.083 --> 11:40.667
I just kind of
handed you that one.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.667
Hey.
You wanna grab some lunch?

11:46.709 --> 11:48.166
Hmm, I can't.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.625
Then do you want
to mess around?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.166
( chuckles )

11:53.208 --> 11:55.750
Mm. Yes,

11:55.792 --> 11:58.667
but I have an appointment.

11:58.709 --> 12:01.125
That you can't cancel?
That I shouldn't cancel.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.917
I'm-- Mm.

12:03.959 --> 12:07.083
I'm interviewing
a couple of IVF specialists.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.041
Huh.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.583
Cool.
Ha, ha.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.417
Sam, I didn't mean to--
That's fine.

12:12.458 --> 12:13.709
Any other time--

12:13.750 --> 12:15.041
Any other time, I would.
I get it.

12:15.083 --> 12:19.000
I didn't have a condom
on me anyway, so...

12:20.250 --> 12:22.500
Sam, this is weird.
No, it's fine.

12:22.542 --> 12:27.083
You do what you have to do.
And it's-- It's fine. Really.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.000
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.041
Actually, I'm...

12:31.083 --> 12:32.583
You know,
I'm excited about it.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.041
And I know I don't talk to you
about it much,

12:35.083 --> 12:37.041
but I could if you want.
No, you don't have to.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.083
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm happy for you.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.291
I am happy for you.
But this is your thing.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.125
And I--
Oh, sorry.

12:43.166 --> 12:46.041
Am I, uh, interrupting?
SAM: No.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.667
JAKE:
Well, that's a whole lot
of uterine transplant research

12:48.709 --> 12:50.625
for someone who thinks
it's a crazy procedure.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.250
I am intellectually curious,
but my opinion hasn't changed.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.750
JAKE:
That's a shame
in this case.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.208
The guys on the transplant team,

12:56.250 --> 13:00.750
they're fine for the job,
but I'd prefer you.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.875
Listen, Nina's checking
into the hospital tomorrow.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.083
Go talk to her.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.166
If you're not interested,
I'll leave you alone.

13:06.208 --> 13:08.041
Promise?

13:08.083 --> 13:10.667
You hungry?
Yeah.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.000
Bonjour.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.291
Violet, this is Annette.
She's Daisy's mom.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.041
And this is Lynn.
Little Truman is hers.

13:24.083 --> 13:28.041
And that handsome boy
is my Leo.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.709
What are you drinking,
red or white?

13:29.750 --> 13:31.041
( Violet chuckles )

13:31.083 --> 13:33.166
Don't mind Lynn.
She just stopped breast-feeding,

13:33.208 --> 13:34.959
and so she's making up
for lost time.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.041
Truman turned 3
and lost interest.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.041
But we're still
sharing a bed,

13:39.083 --> 13:40.792
so the bonding
isn't interrupted.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.667
Oh, you don't find that--?

13:42.709 --> 13:44.500
I mean, a family bed,
it's great for bonding,

13:44.542 --> 13:46.208
but it can be a little tricky
to, uh--

13:46.250 --> 13:48.125
For what, a sex life?

13:48.166 --> 13:50.709
( women laugh )

13:50.750 --> 13:54.000
Honestly, that's not really
on my list of priorities.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.041
So tell us about you.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.792
Oh, I'm a-- I'm a psychiatrist
and a writer.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.792
Oh, yeah, we all read your book.
Loved it.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.083
VIOLET:
Oh, thank you.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.750
Yes. It was actually kind of
painful to get it all out.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.208
And, uh, plus,
I was practicing full-time, so--

14:09.250 --> 14:12.041
Did you write it to help
with the preschool apps?

14:12.083 --> 14:14.041
Genius.

14:14.083 --> 14:17.000
No, I-- Preschool?
Lucas is only 2.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.792
I'm sure that's fine too.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.041
Did Leo make up
with his cousin?

14:25.083 --> 14:27.041
Yeah.
The bite barely broke skin.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.625
Leo bit his cousin?
It's just a phase.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.834
Actually, not when he's--
How old is he, 5?

14:32.875 --> 14:36.208
Most kids outgrow that
by the time they're 3,

14:36.250 --> 14:37.667
so when they're Leo's age,

14:37.709 --> 14:40.041
that can be a way
of getting attention

14:40.083 --> 14:41.458
or dealing with stress.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.375
Has he experienced
any trauma lately?

14:47.083 --> 14:49.417
We should get some snacks
for the kids.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.208
I can help.
Oh, no, that's fine.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.250
Uh, why don't you
just wait here?

15:03.542 --> 15:06.667
Wow. Comes with a stocked bar.
We made the right hire.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.250
I think your office
is bigger than mine.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.166
Not that I'd wanna
put in a bar.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.917
JAKE: Thanks for taking me on.
COOPER: And thank you.

15:12.959 --> 15:15.291
SAM:
Wow. His office
is bigger than yours.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.041
And he's got a bar.
Sometimes a woman needs a drink

15:18.083 --> 15:19.500
when you tell her
she's infertile.

15:19.542 --> 15:21.458
I know that's a little
unorthodox, but, uh...

15:21.500 --> 15:24.083
We're actually-- We're pretty
relaxed around here.

15:24.125 --> 15:27.041
When Pete's not dealing with
his heart attack by yelling.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.291
And Violet's not frustrated
she's still suspended.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.041
And Charlotte's
actually speaking to me.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.041
Yeah.
What'd you do?

15:33.083 --> 15:35.208
Why assume it's my fault?
It usually is.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.125
Jake doesn't know that.
Did you apologize yet?

15:37.166 --> 15:38.917
Repeatedly. Of course.
Did you mean it?

15:38.959 --> 15:40.917
Time for flowers.
SAM: Or dinner.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.041
You guys know I'm married
to Charlotte? Charlotte King?

15:43.083 --> 15:44.834
JAKE:
You know, apologies
make sense to men.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.458
Find the problem,
fix it, right?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.208
That's kind of how we're built.
But, uh, for women,

15:49.250 --> 15:50.917
the words don't
really mean anything

15:50.959 --> 15:53.667
unless they understand you get
where their heads are at.

15:53.709 --> 15:57.041
I mean, relationships are
philosophy to them, not science.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.041
You just gotta get
where Charlotte's coming from.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.875
Oh.
It's how I make my living.

16:02.917 --> 16:04.291
I'm in the business
of knowing women.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.375
COOPER: Hmm, yeah.
SHELDON &amp; SAM: Yeah.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.709
Kind of makes you sound
like a pimp, though.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.333
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, a little bit.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.041
Hi.
Hey.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.709
Sorry that took so long.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.375
I had to stop at the toy store
to get some puzzles for Lucas

16:22.417 --> 16:25.500
and then I got stuck
on a phone call.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.041
I'm trying to get into
a private mommy-and-me class

16:28.083 --> 16:29.458
that has a waiting list.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.083
Where's Lucas?
I put him to bed.

16:32.125 --> 16:36.291
According to Sam,
I'm a fully-functional adult.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.709
Fully functional? He said--

16:38.750 --> 16:41.000
I'm cleared
for physical activity.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.750
All physical activity?
Mm-hm.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.000
Thank you, God.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.208
( upbeat rock music playing )

17:08.583 --> 17:11.417
Who are you, and what have you
done with my husband?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.250
( mellow theme playing )

17:33.500 --> 17:36.417
I understand where
you're coming from. I get it.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.500
I get you.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.917
You know, it's a, uh--

17:41.959 --> 17:44.291
It's a science,
not a philosophy.

17:44.333 --> 17:48.625
I mean, it's a philosophy,
not a science, our relationship.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.917
And I just...

17:50.959 --> 17:54.250
I hear you, and I understand.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.500
And I am sorry for everything.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.291
What exactly is it
that you understand?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.917
I have no idea.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.875
Which is why you're
still sleeping on the couch.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.083
Yeah.

18:17.542 --> 18:20.625
SAM:
Are you really ready to just
give up on 20 years of marriage

18:20.667 --> 18:24.417
without exploring
every other option?

18:24.458 --> 18:26.083
Laura loves you.
That hasn't changed.

18:26.125 --> 18:29.041
The medication made her--
She had sex with strangers.

18:29.083 --> 18:32.208
Do you think the medication
made her lie to me too?

18:32.250 --> 18:33.834
Do you think
it made her betray

18:33.875 --> 18:36.041
every single thing
I thought we were about?

18:36.083 --> 18:37.417
I don't know.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.667
I don't know how it affected
her brain chemistry.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.917
I don't know what was medication
and what was choice.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.083
But I think...

18:45.291 --> 18:49.125
What I'm trying to say
is that illness changes people,

18:49.166 --> 18:51.709
on the inside
and on the out.

18:51.750 --> 18:55.417
That's why the marriage vows say
"in sickness and in health."

18:56.959 --> 19:00.041
Now, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.

19:00.083 --> 19:04.333
What I'm saying is that you
should hear Dr. Shepherd out.

19:06.542 --> 19:07.709
( knocking on door )

19:07.750 --> 19:09.041
Hi. Can I come in?

19:09.083 --> 19:12.458
Hi. Yeah, I was just about
to go buy some flowers.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.709
I'm not gonna be
any great shakes after surgery,

19:14.750 --> 19:18.041
so I wanna make sure that Nina
has something nice to look at.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.959
See you later.
Okay.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.625
Anytime I got sick as a kid,

19:23.667 --> 19:25.834
my mom cleaned my room
and brought me flowers.

19:25.875 --> 19:29.000
I didn't realize that Gammy
had done the same for her.

19:30.542 --> 19:34.041
It's a pretty amazing thing
she's gonna do for you.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.917
You think I'm crazy.
No. No, I don't.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.333
But this is...

19:38.375 --> 19:41.125
It's dangerous.
It is an experimental procedure.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.375
You're risking hemorrhaging,
organ rejection,

19:43.417 --> 19:45.041
and this is before
you get to implantation.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.041
I know the risks.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.041
Dr. Reilly laid them all
out for me twice.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.959
When I was younger,
my mom worried all the time.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.041
"Call me when you get there."
"Who are you going with?"

19:55.083 --> 19:56.166
"What time will you be home?"

19:56.208 --> 19:58.041
I just thought
that she was insane.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.125
And every time,
she said to me:

20:00.166 --> 20:04.375
"When you're a mother,
you'll understand."

20:04.417 --> 20:07.041
I wanna be so close to someone
that I know them

20:07.083 --> 20:09.250
from the moment they start
growing inside of me.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.208
I want a baby.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.625
My baby.

20:12.667 --> 20:17.041
To love
and protect and teach.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.041
So when I read about
Dr. Reilly's research--

20:19.083 --> 20:20.750
It's not a guarantee
that it will work.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.667
There are no guarantees
in life.

20:22.709 --> 20:24.041
But if something
is worth having,

20:24.083 --> 20:26.458
you've gotta give it a try,
right?

20:26.500 --> 20:30.041
Because if this works,
someday when my kid

20:30.083 --> 20:33.583
is driving me
insane with worry,

20:33.625 --> 20:36.417
I'll finally understand.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.000
( tender theme playing )

20:45.709 --> 20:47.000
So?

20:48.542 --> 20:50.083
Let's take the shot.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.417
I'll implant where the signals
are generating your tremors.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.875
I'm gonna be awake for this.
Won't that hurt?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.750
Well, the brain
has no pain fibers

21:00.792 --> 21:03.333
so all you'll feel is a pinch
and a little vibration.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.083
The electrode
will connect to a wire

21:05.125 --> 21:08.542
I will feed under the skin of
your head, neck and shoulder.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.458
I'll place a neurostimulator
under your collarbone,

21:11.500 --> 21:14.291
which will send impulses
to block the tremor signals.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.709
Poking around in my brain,
you could damage another part.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.500
What if--? What if I go blind?

21:19.542 --> 21:21.208
Oh, there's no chance
of blindness.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.041
It's a very targeted procedure.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.917
I know this is a lot
to take in,

21:24.959 --> 21:28.875
but Dr. Shepherd
is a very gifted neurosurgeon.

21:28.917 --> 21:33.041
This could be good, Laura.
It could get us back on track.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.500
Yeah, but it's all
really terrifying.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.667
More terrifying than life
without me?

21:38.709 --> 21:41.041
Look, I don't mean to--

21:41.083 --> 21:43.291
I'm scared too,
but you need this.

21:43.333 --> 21:47.000
We need this. I need to be able
to trust you again.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.041
Please.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.041
Have the surgery.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.000
( tense theme playing )

22:00.083 --> 22:01.875
I could've been
screwing anyone.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.041
I mean, I'm with my wife,
and for all I felt,

22:04.083 --> 22:06.875
I could've been
screwing a prostitute.

22:06.917 --> 22:09.041
It was like I was
watching the whole thing.

22:09.083 --> 22:12.417
And I felt nothing,
no connection.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.333
Sometimes sex is just sex.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.542
Yeah, well, for Violet and me,

22:15.583 --> 22:17.291
sex is pretty much
always about connecting.

22:17.333 --> 22:21.041
I mean,
last night was intense,

22:21.083 --> 22:23.792
but, I don't know,
it was different.

22:23.834 --> 22:27.792
Any other time you felt
that kind of disconnect?

22:27.834 --> 22:29.041
Maybe in foster care

22:29.083 --> 22:30.750
when I was getting
the crap kicked out of me.

22:30.792 --> 22:33.041
Did that happen a lot?

22:33.083 --> 22:35.834
Yeah. When I was 13,
I was put in this foster home.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.709
They'd already taken in
three other boys,

22:37.750 --> 22:40.041
and after the foster parents
went to sleep,

22:40.083 --> 22:43.250
the boys would take me to
the garage and just beat on me

22:43.291 --> 22:45.667
until they got bored
or I was unconscious.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.041
Well, how did that situation
resolve itself?

22:48.083 --> 22:50.208
I fought back.
Broke the biggest kid's nose.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.417
Then they left me alone.
And that disconnection,

22:52.458 --> 22:54.792
do you think it was
some kind of a coping mechanism?

22:54.834 --> 22:56.667
To deal with my anger?
Sheldon, I wasn't angry

22:56.709 --> 22:59.375
that Violet wanted
to have sex with me.

22:59.417 --> 23:01.792
Are you sure?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.041
All right, come on, Lukey.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.875
You don't wanna try
the creamed spinach?

23:07.917 --> 23:10.792
It's organic
and filled with antioxidants.

23:10.834 --> 23:13.166
Come on. Don't you wanna
learn to read before Truman?

23:13.208 --> 23:14.792
You don't like it.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.208
Could I have some of mine?
Yeah, yeah.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.041
All right.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.041
I'm just trying to do
what's best for you.

23:22.083 --> 23:24.041
And for Daddy.
Yes.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.917
He seems good, doesn't he?
Mm-hm.

23:26.959 --> 23:30.667
Yeah, which is weird because
he was so angry and distant,

23:30.709 --> 23:32.792
but then strangely hot.

23:32.834 --> 23:35.041
Although, detached and...

23:35.083 --> 23:37.583
Yeah, this is a completely
inappropriate conversation

23:37.625 --> 23:39.208
to be having with my son,
which I'm having

23:39.250 --> 23:41.250
because the other mommies
wouldn't talk to me.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.041
You don't wanna eat,
so you know what?

23:43.083 --> 23:46.458
There is no reason we can't both
learn to speak a new language.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.542
All right?

23:48.583 --> 23:49.917
( speaks in Spanish )

23:49.959 --> 23:51.709
That means "boy."
That's you.

23:51.750 --> 23:52.917
Say "el niÃ±o."

23:52.959 --> 23:54.750
( babbles )

23:54.792 --> 23:56.333
Right.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.834
( speaks in Spanish )

23:58.875 --> 24:00.166
( babbles )

24:00.208 --> 24:02.041
Mama. That's me.

24:02.083 --> 24:06.041
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

24:06.083 --> 24:09.041
And "loco."

24:09.083 --> 24:10.667
That means crazy.

24:10.709 --> 24:13.250
That's how la madre feels.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.041
( soft theme playing )

24:24.333 --> 24:26.500
SHELDON: Jake left you a bottle.
Yeah.

24:26.542 --> 24:28.709
Yeah, he's cool. I like him.
Yeah.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.083
You want me
to take it for you?

24:30.125 --> 24:33.792
Whoa. That is a $100 bottle
of pinot, Sheldon. Hands off.

24:33.834 --> 24:36.583
I-I'll keep it for guests.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.750
Even sober people
have dinner parties.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
am I interrupting?

24:42.500 --> 24:44.709
Not at all, not at all.
I was just leaving.

24:46.125 --> 24:49.125
Laura, are you okay?
No. I don't--

24:49.166 --> 24:52.458
Yes and no.
I don't... Um...

24:52.500 --> 24:55.000
I'm not gonna
have the surgery.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.333
Uh...

25:00.083 --> 25:02.041
I get it.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.542
It's really scary.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.291
The idea of someone
cutting into your brain.

25:06.333 --> 25:09.166
Oh, no. It's not that.
I mean, ugh-- But...

25:09.208 --> 25:12.500
It's-- I don't wanna
give up my meds.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.750
Uh...

25:16.083 --> 25:18.500
I don't understand.
I like my meds.

25:18.542 --> 25:21.041
I love my meds.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.166
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be dense here,

25:23.208 --> 25:25.500
but we're not
talking about opiates.

25:25.542 --> 25:28.041
I mean, your meds
aren't addictive.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.041
It's not addictive that,
for the first time in my life,

25:30.083 --> 25:32.041
I don't care what
other people think about me?

25:32.083 --> 25:34.667
For the first time in my life,
I'm completely uninhibited.

25:34.709 --> 25:36.166
Yesterday,
in the grocery store,

25:36.208 --> 25:38.333
I walked up to a man,
and five minutes later, five,

25:38.375 --> 25:41.250
we were doing it in the back
where they store the produce.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.667
( laughing )

25:42.709 --> 25:45.166
That is addictive.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.166
( laughs )

25:47.208 --> 25:50.542
I mean, would you look at me?
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

25:50.583 --> 25:54.041
I haven't bothered to wax
anything in ten years

25:54.083 --> 25:55.333
because who cares?

25:55.375 --> 25:57.166
And suddenly...

25:57.208 --> 25:59.834
Suddenly, I feel sexy.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.667
I feel alive.

26:01.709 --> 26:02.875
( sighs )

26:02.917 --> 26:05.875
Oh, God. I feel just
connected to my body

26:05.917 --> 26:09.000
in ways that I forgot existed.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.166
Everything's changed.

26:12.208 --> 26:14.709
I can't give it up.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.041
I don't wanna go back.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.458
Your husband--
No, I will use condoms.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.041
I mean, no matter what,
from now on,

26:21.083 --> 26:23.041
I will keep Will safe.
I will. I will.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.375
But you have to tell him that
the surgery's not an option.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.583
Tell him that it won't
work for me. Please.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.667
Please.

26:31.709 --> 26:36.083
Laura, you know you sound
a little crazy, right?

26:36.125 --> 26:39.041
There is a certain high
from the lack of inhibitions.

26:39.083 --> 26:42.000
I get that. I really do.

26:43.375 --> 26:46.333
How much are you willing
to give up to hold on to that?

26:46.375 --> 26:49.041
Dr. Shepherd,
I have Parkinson's.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.625
I'm dying.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.041
I'm not quite 40,

26:53.083 --> 26:58.250
so I don't actually have
all that much else left to lose.

26:58.291 --> 27:01.000
( dramatic theme playing )

27:03.917 --> 27:05.500
Lunch and...

27:05.542 --> 27:06.750
Hi.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.041
Hey-- Wow.

27:09.083 --> 27:12.709
Violet.
That's a radical change.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.000
You look fantastic.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.291
Oh, yeah. Whatever.
Hi, baby.

27:15.333 --> 27:19.125
I was bored. I am bored.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.917
Do you wanna
have lunch with us?

27:22.041 --> 27:23.542
Uh...

27:25.125 --> 27:28.083
ADDISON:
All right.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.917
( Addison laughs )

27:29.959 --> 27:35.083
Okay. Lucas, Auntie Addison
is very, very hungry,

27:35.125 --> 27:37.250
so I'm gonna go eat lunch
with your mommy

27:37.291 --> 27:38.667
while you go and play

27:38.709 --> 27:41.083
with the pink whales
in the sand.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.500
Wanna go play?

27:42.542 --> 27:44.041
Hey, buddy.
ADDISON: All right.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.834
Good guy.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.000
ADDISON:
Yeah, go water them.

27:54.083 --> 27:55.583
Are you...?

27:57.083 --> 27:58.125
Are you hiding?

28:00.625 --> 28:03.041
I thought it was a woman
from my mommy group.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.709
You're in a mommy group?

28:04.750 --> 28:07.041
I went once.
Hated them all.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.041
That's a lie.
They didn't like me.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.917
They're not even
returning my e-mails.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.542
Oh.
So I chopped off my hair.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.375
I see.

28:20.417 --> 28:23.375
You're very polite.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.041
Well, I don't know
what to say.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.041
I mean, you and I,
we work together,

28:28.083 --> 28:29.750
but it's not like
we've ever been friends.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.041
You used to sleep
with my husband,

28:31.083 --> 28:32.041
take care of my son.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.041
I thought of anybody,
you would be able--

28:34.083 --> 28:36.041
All right, I think
you're being ridiculous.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.375
Oh, wow.
No. I mean,

28:37.417 --> 28:40.041
of course you don't like
any of the mommies

28:40.083 --> 28:41.125
in the mommy group.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.000
You have nothing in common
with these women

28:43.041 --> 28:45.000
other than the fact
that you all have children.

28:45.041 --> 28:47.458
I mean, it would be
like me being friends

28:47.500 --> 28:49.166
with every infertile woman
in town

28:49.208 --> 28:52.250
just because
we can't have kids.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.208
Yes.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.875
Yes, yes.

28:55.917 --> 28:58.667
God. I feel better.
Good.

28:58.709 --> 29:01.333
You know, I mean, here I am,
trying to have a baby,

29:01.375 --> 29:02.875
you know, without Sam.

29:02.917 --> 29:06.041
And that's weird, of course.
We were talking about me still.

29:06.083 --> 29:09.834
We weren't done.
Right. Sorry.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.291
I'm just...

29:13.083 --> 29:15.041
I'm just really lonely.
I am not a mommy-group mommy,

29:15.083 --> 29:16.875
and I'm not allowed to work,

29:16.917 --> 29:19.041
and my husband
had a heart attack.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.583
That's a scary sentence.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.291
Thank you.

29:24.583 --> 29:25.959
Do you wanna be friends?

29:27.083 --> 29:29.041
I mean,
is that what this lunch is?

29:29.083 --> 29:30.333
Do you?

29:32.125 --> 29:34.166
I like your haircut.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.333
I...

29:38.917 --> 29:41.750
I think it's great you wanna
have a kid on your own.

29:41.792 --> 29:44.041
Yeah?
I'm lonely too, you know?

29:44.083 --> 29:46.041
Without Nai,
I'm really lonely.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.875
So we'll be friends.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.291
We'll be friends.

29:57.041 --> 29:58.500
SAM: Hey.
COOPER: Hey, Sam.

29:58.542 --> 30:01.917
How is your relationship going?
Mine is great.

30:01.959 --> 30:04.959
You should really think
about getting married. Mm.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.041
Hey, did you schedule
Laura's surgery yet?

30:08.083 --> 30:09.667
She canceled it.

30:09.709 --> 30:13.041
She is not interested
in changing her behavior.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.250
She wants to sleep around.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.166
She even asked me
to tell her husband

30:16.208 --> 30:18.041
that surgery is not an option.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.125
Well, you can't lie
to the man.

30:19.166 --> 30:21.166
I am well aware of that,
Charlotte,

30:21.208 --> 30:23.041
which is why I'm saying
nothing at all.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.792
So Laura gets a free pass to
cheat on her husband?

30:25.834 --> 30:27.792
How she lives her life,
that's her own business.

30:27.834 --> 30:31.000
She's in a relationship.
No, that's not right.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.041
Once you betray
your partner's trust,

30:33.083 --> 30:35.542
it's hard to get it back.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.709
Wow. You're a bitch
to me and to Cooper.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.125
Who knew you had such range?

30:48.959 --> 30:50.792
JAKE:
Now, that is a beautiful uterus.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.166
Nicely done.
ADDISON: Thank you.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.083
What do you think about
Joanie Matthews?

30:55.125 --> 30:59.041
JAKE:
Uh, she's a bit of
an IVF mad scientist.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.166
Brilliant. Why?

31:01.208 --> 31:03.333
ADDISON:
Just looking around.
Dave Atkins?

31:03.375 --> 31:06.875
Oh, he's real old-school.
Warm, great bedside manner.

31:06.917 --> 31:08.250
I think you should
meet with them both.

31:08.291 --> 31:10.959
Send me a list of who you're
looking at. I'll vet them.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.625
ADDISON: Thank you.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

31:13.667 --> 31:16.041
I am going to release
the Kelly.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.667
There we go.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.041
( EKG beeping )

31:19.083 --> 31:21.000
Damn it. Okay. The internal
iliac has retracted.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.250
I need to stop the bleeding.

31:22.291 --> 31:24.750
Gonna have to clamp
the vascular supply proximally.

31:24.792 --> 31:28.000
There's too much blood.
I need you to clear the field.

31:30.083 --> 31:33.458
Damn it. Retracted too far.
I need to embolize the vessel.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.500
Cross her for six units
and hang the FFP.

31:36.542 --> 31:39.375
If you embolize, it's gonna cut
supply to the transplant.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.875
JAKE:
If I don't, I'll lose Nina.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.458
Come on, Nina.
Hang in there.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.000
Hang in there now.

31:49.083 --> 31:52.041
( soft dramatic theme playing )

31:52.083 --> 31:54.041
You fought one hell
of a fight in there, cowboy.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.291
( chuckles )

31:55.333 --> 31:56.500
Lost, though.

31:56.542 --> 31:57.917
Look, you tried,

31:57.959 --> 31:59.709
which is more than
most doctors would've done.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.041
It's more than
I would've done.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.041
You saved her life.
That's a win.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.291
Not for me, it isn't.

32:12.458 --> 32:14.875
There.
VIOLET: Yeah, silly Pooh.

32:16.250 --> 32:19.458
Hey. Um, hey, before you go,
I was thinking

32:19.500 --> 32:22.208
I wanna give the nanny
a few more hours.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.041
I wanna start another book.
I think it'd be good for me.

32:25.083 --> 32:26.291
Lucas is gonna need therapy

32:26.333 --> 32:28.458
when he's old enough
to read the first one.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.458
Come on, Pete.
You're in the office every day.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.667
You get to use your training,
your intellect.

32:33.709 --> 32:35.250
Every part of you
is engaged.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.041
And, uh, I want that too.
I need it.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.041
I can't believe it.
Already bored with motherhood.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.709
You don't think that raising
our child is important work.

32:41.750 --> 32:44.542
Of course it is. But I don't
see why I have to do it

32:44.583 --> 32:46.041
to the exclusion
of everything else.

32:46.083 --> 32:49.667
It's important Lucas sees
a woman who's well-rounded--

32:49.709 --> 32:51.583
A 2-year-old
doesn't want well-rounded.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.291
A 2-year-old
wants his mother.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.500
So long, pal. Bye.

32:57.542 --> 33:00.041
It's not like I've been
at home for the past two years.

33:00.083 --> 33:04.041
Why is it such a shock I would
wanna work and raise my child?

33:04.083 --> 33:06.000
What the hell
is going on with you?

33:07.083 --> 33:08.500
I'm late for work.

33:11.959 --> 33:15.709
I'm sorry, Nina.
I'm so sorry.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.834
But we knew
this was a long shot, right?

33:17.875 --> 33:19.083
We knew that,
but we tried anyway,

33:19.125 --> 33:21.417
because that was
important to you.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.917
You're young, you have
the support of your family,

33:25.959 --> 33:27.500
and you will be a mother.

33:27.542 --> 33:31.083
We can explore surrogacy now
or you can adopt.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.041
But I wanted to be
like my mom.

33:33.083 --> 33:36.041
I know. And if your mom
were here right now,

33:36.083 --> 33:38.041
she would tell you that
it wasn't giving birth to you

33:38.083 --> 33:39.917
that defined her.

33:39.959 --> 33:42.583
It was the first time you
looked in her eyes and smiled.

33:42.625 --> 33:46.792
It was the first time
you fell asleep on her shoulder

33:46.834 --> 33:49.792
and she'd barely
let herself breathe

33:49.834 --> 33:52.000
because she never wanted
that moment to end.

33:54.083 --> 33:57.625
You will have your baby,

33:57.667 --> 33:59.041
however she comes
into the world,

33:59.083 --> 34:02.041
and you will love her
incredibly well,

34:02.083 --> 34:04.083
because your mom
taught you how.

34:05.667 --> 34:07.458
And that's all that matters.

34:07.500 --> 34:11.000
Okay?
That's all that matters.

34:13.291 --> 34:15.208
Hi.
Hey.

34:15.250 --> 34:18.000
Thanks for, uh--
Thanks for meeting me here.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.250
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, is there a reason

34:20.291 --> 34:22.125
we couldn't meet
at the office?

34:22.166 --> 34:26.792
Well, I was just hoping to,
uh, speak to you as a friend

34:26.834 --> 34:28.625
rather than a doctor.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.083
Um...
Okay.

34:30.125 --> 34:34.208
I don't understand why or how
you could do this to Will.

34:35.750 --> 34:39.792
Well, that's because
you and I aren't friends.

34:39.834 --> 34:42.041
Fair enough. Uh...

34:42.083 --> 34:43.667
Well, what about
20 years of marriage?

34:43.709 --> 34:45.375
That's gotta mean something.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.291
With these meds,
I don't have a really great

34:47.333 --> 34:49.000
editing mechanism anymore.
Okay.

34:49.041 --> 34:52.166
So I'm just gonna say
some things. Uh...

34:52.208 --> 34:54.250
My husband won't have sex

34:54.291 --> 34:56.709
outside of
the missionary position.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.083
And if he finishes
before I do,

34:58.125 --> 35:00.375
he rolls over
and he goes to sleep.

35:00.417 --> 35:02.291
Early on in our marriage,

35:02.333 --> 35:04.625
when he caught me
trying to finish

35:04.667 --> 35:09.041
after he was done,
he called me disgusting.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.917
Disgusting.
So he has some issues.

35:11.959 --> 35:15.041
In this particular area,
he has issues.

35:15.083 --> 35:18.125
And his issues
have become my issues.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.709
Mm-hm.
That's what happens

35:19.750 --> 35:21.041
in a marriage.
That's right.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.875
And he has no interest
in dealing with those issues.

35:23.917 --> 35:27.709
And for the first time,
I understand that,

35:27.750 --> 35:33.583
because I have no interest in
dealing with mine.

35:33.625 --> 35:36.542
I mean,
we make a great team.

35:36.583 --> 35:40.500
On so many levels, we're--
We're a great team.

35:40.542 --> 35:44.500
So don't judge me.
Please.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.667
You're not
inside my marriage.

35:46.709 --> 35:50.166
And you can't be inside
anybody else's marriage, either.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.000
You have to know that.

35:52.041 --> 35:55.041
Appearances,
they mean nothing.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.959
Clearly.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.500
Look at me.

36:01.417 --> 36:03.583
PETE:
She leaves us
every chance she gets

36:03.625 --> 36:05.041
for these rooms
full of strangers,

36:05.083 --> 36:07.917
who are desperate to tell her
what a difference she made.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.041
Violet decided to go
on the book tour.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.709
She wants to write.
Not the same thing.

36:11.750 --> 36:14.041
Well, it feels the same.
Don't be such a baby.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.709
Excuse me?

36:15.750 --> 36:17.041
You want the benefit
of my expertise,

36:17.083 --> 36:18.125
as a friend, without paying?

36:18.166 --> 36:20.333
Well, with that
comes the truth.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.041
What are you afraid of, Pete?

36:22.083 --> 36:24.500
Sheldon, I worked
in Bosnia in a war zone.

36:24.542 --> 36:26.500
I'm in the chaos of the ER
every day.

36:26.542 --> 36:28.917
I'm not a guy that gets scared.
I told you. I'm angry.

36:28.959 --> 36:31.166
I know what you told me,
but a 14-year-old boy

36:31.208 --> 36:33.959
who's dumped with foster
families isn't just angry.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.250
And the disconnect you feel,
that's not about anger.

36:38.208 --> 36:40.041
So, what are you afraid of?

36:40.083 --> 36:43.083
( dramatic theme playing )

36:44.792 --> 36:46.750
( soft theme playing )

36:46.792 --> 36:50.041
Hey. Uh, I think
you were right.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.375
One of my favorite sentences
in the world.

36:53.417 --> 36:54.959
Right about what?
About Laura.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.625
I talked to her, and, uh,
I guess it is her business.

36:58.667 --> 37:01.333
You know, what she's doing
and what she tells Will.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.959
It's not easy, but sometimes
the truth is worse.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.750
Yeah.

37:05.792 --> 37:09.375
So I guess she'll have her high,
he won't know,

37:09.417 --> 37:11.834
and hopefully...

37:11.875 --> 37:13.458
It'll be better that way.

37:19.709 --> 37:21.500
( playing ascending scales )

37:31.750 --> 37:34.041
I'm drowning here, Charlotte.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.166
And I obviously don't know
what to do to save myself,

37:36.208 --> 37:37.709
and every time
I try to say anything,

37:37.750 --> 37:39.875
it's like tying another
cinder block to my ankle.

37:39.917 --> 37:45.041
So if you just tell me
what to do, I will do it,

37:45.083 --> 37:47.500
whatever it is, happily.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.917
Seriously, come on.
Tell-- Tell me.

37:49.959 --> 37:52.750
Come on. Tell me.

37:52.792 --> 37:53.917
Tell me.
Stop it.

37:53.959 --> 37:57.500
You made me
be the sheriff with you.

37:57.542 --> 38:00.041
It sucks being the sheriff.
I'm good at it.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.375
Everybody already thinks I'm
the Wicked Witch of St. Ambrose.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.875
Everyone who?
Everyone-- Amelia?

38:03.917 --> 38:06.667
Look, I don't care.
It's fine. It's my job.

38:06.709 --> 38:08.041
The job isn't
about making friends.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.041
But you're my husband.

38:10.083 --> 38:13.000
Don't make me be the sheriff
with you too.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.458
Look...

38:18.083 --> 38:22.041
I don't regret saving Kerri.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.083
I don't.

38:23.125 --> 38:26.333
But I do regret
not having your back.

38:26.375 --> 38:30.709
I will never put you
in that position again,

38:30.750 --> 38:33.291
and I will not make you
be the sheriff.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.333
( tender theme playing )

38:48.000 --> 38:51.041
We should be able to tell
each other anything, right?

38:51.083 --> 38:53.333
That sounds like the prelude
to something bad.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.333
No, no.
No, it's not bad.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.041
Sam.
I--

38:57.083 --> 38:58.917
If you have something
to tell me...

38:58.959 --> 39:02.041
No, no, no. It's not me.
It's you. It's yesterday.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.583
You wanted to talk to me
about the IVF stuff,

39:04.625 --> 39:08.083
and I, uh, I cut you off.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.375
And I'm sorry.

39:09.417 --> 39:11.709
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

39:11.750 --> 39:15.375
We're together and, you know,
we shouldn't have secrets

39:15.417 --> 39:17.166
or, you know,
things that we're thinking about

39:17.208 --> 39:19.333
that we can't say.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.750
Agreed.

39:21.792 --> 39:25.000
Okay, good. So tell me--

39:25.041 --> 39:26.959
Tell me about the IVF,
the doctors.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.417
Is there anybody
that you like? Um...

39:29.458 --> 39:31.166
Sam.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.917
Mm.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.750
Thank you.

39:35.792 --> 39:40.041
But really, I'm fine.

39:40.083 --> 39:42.041
Okay.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.875
( slow pop music playing )

40:07.083 --> 40:08.291
I'm afraid you think
I'm a bad mother

40:08.333 --> 40:10.000
and that you don't
love me enough.

40:13.083 --> 40:16.041
I'm afraid I'll die before
I'm done raising Lucas.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.417
I renamed the practice.
Did I tell you?

40:24.458 --> 40:28.583
Seaside Health and Wellness.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.458
I thought about calling it
Montgomery Wellness.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.417
Bizzy would've told me
to do that.

40:32.458 --> 40:35.291
It is all of my money
funding the place now.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.917
But I didn't do it.

40:38.959 --> 40:43.625
It is a cooperative practice,
and the name reflects that.

40:43.667 --> 40:45.041
A few years ago, I...

40:45.083 --> 40:47.625
THERAPIST:
You would've gone with
"Montgomery."

40:47.667 --> 40:51.417
Yeah. I would have.

40:51.458 --> 40:53.041
So...

40:53.083 --> 40:55.458
You know, no matter what,
whatever happens,

40:55.500 --> 40:58.041
Sam has rubbed off on me.

40:58.083 --> 41:01.375
His goodness, his kindness,

41:01.417 --> 41:03.917
his honesty,

41:03.959 --> 41:08.500
his generosity of spirit...

41:08.542 --> 41:10.375
has rubbed off.

41:11.792 --> 41:13.834
( both chuckling )

41:15.083 --> 41:17.166
Hello.

41:18.333 --> 41:20.125
See you at lunch.

41:23.125 --> 41:26.041
Cooper?
Yes.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.375
You don't remember me,
do you?

41:28.417 --> 41:32.041
No. I'm sorry,
have we met?

41:32.083 --> 41:34.792
Nine years ago. I was
tending bar at the Key Club.

41:34.834 --> 41:37.291
You came in,
stayed till last call.

41:37.333 --> 41:40.041
We had sex in my SUV
in the parking lot.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.041
( chuckles )

41:42.083 --> 41:45.083
Erica.
Hi, Erica.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.417
Yeah, hi. Awkward.

41:47.458 --> 41:51.041
Yeah.
Uh, I'm married now.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.458
I have a son.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.291
He's 8.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.250
COOPER:
Mm-hm.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.709
His name is Mason.
