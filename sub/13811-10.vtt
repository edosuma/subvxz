{\an8}That's Reggie. Duh.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.322
{\an8}And looking pretty impressive,
too, I might add.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.663
Yeah, pretty impressive.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.873
What's that?

01:21.956 --> 01:24.292
Not a compliment, Bro?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.753
That was awesome mate,
totally rad.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.630
{\an1}Thanks. You're not so bad
yourself.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.964
Well, I'm still
not used

01:30.048 --> 01:32.300
to the way the waves
break around here.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.010
Sounds like maybe you miss
the surf back home.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.596
{\an1}Not as much
as I miss the rugby.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.263
Rugby?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.348
Think extreme soccer

01:38.431 --> 01:41.518
with a little American football
thrown in.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.645
Did somebody
say extreme?

01:43.728 --> 01:45.104
Extremely extreme.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.523
Too gnarly for
you Americans.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.192
Oh, yeah?

01:49.275 --> 01:50.360
{\an3}Try us.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.028
Why don't you teach us, Trent?

01:52.111 --> 01:54.030
{\an1}Okay, if you think
you guys can take it.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.783
{\an1}But you better tape up
your ears.

01:56.866 --> 01:57.283
Why?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.704
So they don't get torn off.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.998
(<i> gasping</i> )

02:05.458 --> 02:08.544
Did he say, "torn off"?

02:11.548 --> 02:12.674
See you tomorrow...

02:12.757 --> 02:13.800
mates.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.885
Yeah, you should definitely
come watch.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
Watch?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.265
Why not? I'm sure you'll
get a big kick out of it.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.224
Ta.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.727
Watch?

02:25.937 --> 02:26.938
I'll show him a kick or two.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.899
Thinks girls can't play, huh?

02:34.904 --> 02:37.073
What's up, Rocket Girl?

02:37.156 --> 02:39.576
Trash can say something
you didn't like.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.243
Huh!

02:40.326 --> 02:41.828
Can you believe Trent?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.788
"Why don't you come and watch?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.790
I think you'd get a kick
out of it."

02:45.874 --> 02:47.000
I thought he was cool.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.627
{\an5}Since when did
my being a girl

02:49.711 --> 02:52.046
stop me from doing <i> anything?</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:53.965
I don't know, Reg.

02:54.048 --> 02:54.757
{\an1}Maybe Trent knows
what he's talking about.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.093
Yeah, I mean, like

02:57.176 --> 02:58.761
he's the rugby player
and everything.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.929
<i>What?!</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:02.098
Tell me I am not hearing this.

03:02.181 --> 03:05.351
Uh, it does sound kind of rough,
Reggie.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.270
I'm surprised
I'm going to do it.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.398
Well, so am I, Squid!

03:10.481 --> 03:11.482
Since you're the one

03:11.566 --> 03:13.776
{\an1}who beefs it all the time,
not me!

03:16.863 --> 03:19.824
Man, are you guys
going to regret this.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.953
I regret it already.

03:25.038 --> 03:25.872
Ray:
<i>But I cleaned it yesterday.</i>

03:25.955 --> 03:28.499
It should be your turn today.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.876
Yes, brother,

03:29.959 --> 03:31.502
but if you clean it today,

03:31.586 --> 03:34.297
I might clean it tomorrow,
and how happy will you be then?

03:34.380 --> 03:37.091
I never thought of it
like that.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.802
{\an1}Reggie:
Raymundo, Tito.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.306
{\an1}Hey, what do you guys know
about rugby?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.682
Rugby.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.017
Hmm, rugby?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.185
Sounds familiar.

03:47.268 --> 03:47.977
Don't you remember, brother?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.313
That summer in Australia?

03:50.396 --> 03:52.106
Right.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.901
On the beach.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.829
(<i> laughter</i> )

04:08.831 --> 04:10.667
Tough game,
huh, Raymundo?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.794
Real tough.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.003
Oh, you wouldn't
be thinking

04:14.087 --> 04:16.297
{\an5}about playing,
would you,
little cuz?

04:16.380 --> 04:18.716
Like the ancient Hawaiians
always said

04:18.800 --> 04:20.843
"Don't bite the head
off a piranha

04:20.927 --> 04:21.719
or you might get chewed."

04:21.803 --> 04:24.305
Come on, Tito.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.183
Reggie's much too smart
to play rugby.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.687
I am smart,
and I'm going to play rugby.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
Don't forget

04:33.189 --> 04:35.525
to tape your ears.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.207
What's up, dude?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.375
Hey, man.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.085
Reporting for rugby, sir.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.003
Hi, mates.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.963
Huh? What did you say?

04:57.046 --> 04:58.089
I said, "Hi, mates."

04:58.172 --> 05:01.592
{\an1}You ready
for some serious scrummage?

05:03.302 --> 05:05.388
Where's Reggie?
I thought she wanted to watch.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.143
Oh, well, you know
how those Sheilas are--

05:10.226 --> 05:11.978
always changing their minds,
right?

05:12.061 --> 05:12.895
Yeah, man.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.313
Sheilas are like that.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.440
{\an3}What?

05:15.523 --> 05:16.441
Notoriously ambivalent.

05:16.524 --> 05:20.445
{\an1}Okay, then, this, mates,
is a rugby ball.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.363
{\an1}The point is to get it past
the defending team.

05:22.447 --> 05:27.076
Now in rugby,
a touchdown is called a "try."

05:27.160 --> 05:27.994
What?!

05:28.077 --> 05:29.996
You want to make us cry?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.081
Ooh, ow!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.624
Ooh.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.466
(<i> grunting</i> )

05:43.051 --> 05:44.260
Yeah.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.388
Whoo! The "O" man strikes again.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.556
All right, Arnold.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.774
Hey, Reg.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.571
(<i> grunting</i> )

06:05.364 --> 06:06.741
Ow.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.452
I don't know.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.953
I think Reggie's really
tweaked out about this.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.456
I feel kind of bad.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.707
Maybe we should have

06:14.791 --> 06:16.417
stuck up for her
more with Trent.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.794
Don't sweat it, Squid.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.461
I know my sister.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.129
She'll get over it.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.423
{\an1}The main thing is,
rugby's totally rad.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.134
{\an1}What position do you want
to play, Twist?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.052
I'm going to be scrumhalf.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.554
What did you
call me?

06:28.638 --> 06:31.974
{\an1}Take the tape
off your ears, dude.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.231
Oh, man!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.656
So sorry.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.367
I didn't realize
it was "Boys' Day."

06:52.286 --> 06:54.997
{\an1}Since when is there
a Boys' Day at Madtown?

06:55.081 --> 06:55.998
It's called sarcasm, Twister.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.668
This is bogus.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.836
Don't be lame, Reg.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.503
{\an3}Come back.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.006
She'll get over it.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.974
Hey, Reggie,
catch a few with us.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.517
Yeah, Rocket Girl.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.768
Come on, Reggie.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.313
Nah, I think
I'll keep surfing with them.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.523
They're more my speed.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.483
Which is a lot faster
than yours.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.526
(<i> laughs</i> )

07:24.277 --> 07:26.237
Come on, girlfriend!

07:26.320 --> 07:28.656
It's shred time!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.953
{\an1}Okay, everybody has
his arms locked

07:34.036 --> 07:34.620
behind his
neighbor's back?

07:35.955 --> 07:37.999
All right, then.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.292
This is the scrum.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.585
It's how we begin
every game.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.090
What are you doing?

07:46.174 --> 07:47.300
I can't tell.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.678
Dancing or just holding hands?

07:50.761 --> 07:54.765
Definitely too rough for me.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.151
Oh, man.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.652
Let's have a little hustle!

08:07.612 --> 08:09.197
Not that it matters

08:09.280 --> 08:11.908
{\an1}but Reggie <i> is</i> the fastest
out of all of us.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.826
{\an3}Yeah, but she's not playing,
so it doesn't matter.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.161
I know.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.538
That's what I said.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.458
Well, you don't have
to get so huffy about it.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.250
Dudes, this is weak.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.920
Something is definitely missing.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.755
Definitely.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.256
(<i> girls laughing</i> )

08:27.340 --> 08:29.926
{\an5}Reggie:
I'll see you
later, guys.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.594
Later, Reg.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.011
{\an3}See you.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.267
{\an3}Go away.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.270
Sorry, this is a
"girl only" space.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.233
We have something to say.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.944
Yeah?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.655
Well, what is
it...<i> boys?</i>

08:52.657 --> 08:55.284
What we wanted to
say is, well, Reg...

08:55.368 --> 08:56.953
The thing is, it's like this.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.079
We're

08:58.162 --> 08:59.080
you know, like...

08:59.163 --> 09:01.123
(<i> groans</i> )

09:01.207 --> 09:02.250
...sorry.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.835
We should have stuck up for you
with Trent.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.880
Yeah. It's totally lame
that you can't play rugby.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.550
You're part of the crew.

09:11.634 --> 09:16.138
Okay, I'll accept the apology
<i>if</i> you make it up to me.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.139
Yeah?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.140
How?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.518
Duh.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.898
Heads. You pick first.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.567
Psych.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.986
Twister, you're with me, dude.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.406
Um... Keith.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.659
Sammy.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.123
Brian.

09:43.332 --> 09:43.708
Reggie.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.670
Reggie? Y-you're here.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.922
Got a problem with it, mate?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.465
No.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.301
Not if you really want to play.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.303
{\an5}Good, then
you shouldn't
have a problem

09:55.386 --> 09:57.221
with <i> them</i> either.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.639
All right, girl.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.474
Let's do this thing.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.898
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

10:10.067 --> 10:12.903
(<i> grunting</i> )

10:14.196 --> 10:15.740
Psych.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.910
Over here, Otto man.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.062
Trent:
Okay, team.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.481
It's time to close the deal.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.818
Yeah, deal with this.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.286
Mine.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.246
Otto:
All right, Reggie!

11:04.330 --> 11:06.457
{\an4}Go Reg.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.457
Run, run.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.252
(<i> cheers</i> )

11:10.336 --> 11:14.548
Great game, mates.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.260
All:
Go, Reggie! Go, Reggie!

11:18.344 --> 11:20.471
It's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

11:22.139 --> 11:23.182
Way to go, Reggie.

11:23.265 --> 11:26.644
Still don't think
girls can play rugby?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.437
I never thought that.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.563
What?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.440
{\an1}I just didn't think
<i>you</i> wanted to.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.650
But now that I know

11:32.733 --> 11:35.027
{\an1}next time,
I want <i> you</i> on my team.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.864
{\an1}And deny me the chance
to cream you again?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.116
No way.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.075
Yeah, dream on, mate.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.327
{\an1}There's no way we're
going to give up

11:43.411 --> 11:45.371
our most valuable player.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.958
(<i> laughter</i> )

11:49.041 --> 11:51.335
Trent:
All right, yeah!

12:06.934 --> 12:08.144
{\an8}It's kind of cold
out here today.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.311
{\an8}Yeah.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.230
{\an8}What's up with these waves?

12:11.313 --> 12:12.064
{\an8}What waves?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.358
{\an8}Man, let's bail. This is lame.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.485
{\an8}It almost looks like
it's going to...

12:16.569 --> 12:18.904
{\an8}Nah, not in Ocean Shores.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.994
{\an8}(<i> electrical buzzing</i> )

12:25.077 --> 12:26.829
{\an5}So, John, are you
telling our viewers

12:26.912 --> 12:28.497
{\an5}that now would be
a good time to panic?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.499
No, but we are telling them

12:30.583 --> 12:34.044
{\an5}that they should be prepared
to panic at any moment.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.337
{\an1}What's happening,
Raymundo?

12:35.421 --> 12:38.674
The storm system El Nada
is supposed to hit tonight.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.010
El Nada?
What's <i> it</i> going to do?

12:41.093 --> 12:44.013
No one's really sure, Otto,
but according to the news

12:44.096 --> 12:47.475
it's going to be the worst storm
in the history of the world.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.310
Oh, come on, Raymundo.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.269
(<i> laughter</i> )

12:50.352 --> 12:52.354
{\an5}El Nada?
I'm sure it'll
be nothing.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.357
Reg, they don't give scary
names to nice storms.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.317
I'm going to go
check to see

12:56.400 --> 12:58.277
{\an1}if we have any hatches
to batten down.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.366
(<i> alarm buzzing</i> )

13:04.450 --> 13:06.702
(<i> yawning</i> )

13:06.785 --> 13:09.413
(<i> grunting</i> )

13:12.750 --> 13:13.584
No!

13:13.667 --> 13:15.961
(<i> screaming</i> )

13:16.045 --> 13:17.463
Raymundo,
what is it?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.797
What's going on?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.508
Okay, nobody panic

13:20.591 --> 13:22.009
but El Nada is in full
force out there.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.054
I'm going to go check
on our food supply.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.139
(<i> panting</i> )

13:28.557 --> 13:30.726
Both:
<i>Whoa.</i>

13:30.809 --> 13:33.854
Reggie:
Is this really happening?

13:36.148 --> 13:38.067
You guys see the snow
everywhere?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.068
{\an1}They just declared
a state of emergency

13:39.151 --> 13:41.529
and all the schools,
businesses and roads

13:41.612 --> 13:42.488
are closed down.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.199
No school!
Everything's shut down!

13:45.282 --> 13:46.867
Snow in Ocean Shores!

13:46.951 --> 13:50.454
I'm <i> so</i> ready to bust
the baddest day ever!

13:52.540 --> 13:56.043
{\an5}We told you El Nada was going
to be big, but this is far worse

13:56.126 --> 13:57.419
{\an5}than anything
we could have predicted.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.507
I better call Tito, tell him
not to open up the Shack today.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.842
{\an5}We urge the citizens
of Ocean Shores

14:03.926 --> 14:06.762
{\an5}to stay calm
during this crisis.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.598
Better check up
on my cousins.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.559
{\an5}Announcer:
...far worse than predicted...

14:11.642 --> 14:13.727
{\an5}(<i> busy signal</i> )

14:11.642 --> 14:13.727
Both:
Uh-oh, phones are out!

14:13.811 --> 14:18.732
I got to get up there
and make sure everybody's okay.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.367
I can't believe

14:28.450 --> 14:30.160
we're going to carve
the incline!

14:30.244 --> 14:32.037
What's that lame-looking
thing, Sam?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.289
A kiddie pool?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.957
You'll see.
You guys take a head start

14:35.040 --> 14:35.958
and I'll catch up.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.001
Hey, man.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.294
Yeah, right.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.295
Whatever.

14:39.378 --> 14:39.962
Yeah!

14:40.045 --> 14:42.047
(<i> cheering</i> )

14:47.886 --> 14:48.971
Oh, yeah!

14:51.390 --> 14:52.558
Mail call!

14:59.231 --> 15:02.026
Get ready
for the Midwest Express.

15:02.109 --> 15:02.985
Huh!

15:06.947 --> 15:08.824
Check out the mass air
<i>I'm</i> going to launch.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.452
(<i> screaming</i> ):
Yeah-hoo!

15:11.535 --> 15:14.580
Whoa-oh, yeah!

15:14.663 --> 15:15.497
(<i> screaming</i> )

15:15.581 --> 15:19.084
Was that the Squid?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.377
{\an3}No <i> way.</i>

15:20.461 --> 15:21.712
Dude, that thing is rad!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.339
I know.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.506
And back home

15:24.590 --> 15:26.467
I was the undisputed saucer king

15:26.550 --> 15:28.302
of the whole tri-county region.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.178
{\an5}Whoa!

15:28.385 --> 15:29.178
Yeah, I can
see why!

15:29.261 --> 15:30.387
{\an3}No way.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.513
Let me ride it
the rest of the way.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.514
I want to try.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.307
No, dude,<i> me!</i>

15:33.390 --> 15:35.643
{\an5}Hey, I called first.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.643
{\an1}Hey!

15:35.726 --> 15:38.187
There's only one way
to settle this.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.688
Are you sure about this, Sam?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.608
Yeah, it seems
kind of sketch.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.860
{\an1}I know, it's going
to be great!

15:44.943 --> 15:49.031
(<i> cheering and yelling</i> )

15:56.246 --> 15:58.332
All:
Whoa!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.002
-Whoa!
-Uh!

16:03.462 --> 16:06.048
I never knew beeping it
could be so rad.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.050
Nothing like a well-executed
wipeout.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.761
{\an5}Again, we want
to warn our viewers

16:10.844 --> 16:12.930
{\an5}that what appears to some
as a light covering of snow

16:13.013 --> 16:15.641
is, in fact, El Nada.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.560
{\an5}As you can see, El Nada is
a full-blown catastrophe.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.562
{\an5}We urge families, especially
those with children,

16:20.646 --> 16:21.772
to stick together

16:21.855 --> 16:24.900
until the disaster is over!
Back to you, John.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.110
Good idea.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.277
Reggie, Otto!

16:27.361 --> 16:29.279
Hey, Rocket Boy, Rocket Girl?!

16:29.363 --> 16:31.156
We've even heard some reports

16:31.240 --> 16:33.867
{\an5}that another quarter-inch
may be on its way.

16:33.951 --> 16:38.080
Oh, no.
I got to go find the kids.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.088
(<i> giggling</i> ):
Ah, yeah!

16:46.171 --> 16:48.590
World's first half-pipe flip
on a board with no wheels.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.260
(<i> laughter</i> )

17:05.733 --> 17:10.112
{\an1}Hey, what happened
to Squid?

17:13.156 --> 17:14.241
Ow!

17:14.324 --> 17:16.743
{\an5}Oh, man, look out.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.743
{\an1}Squid attack!
Look out!

17:16.827 --> 17:20.497
Man, snow plus
Ocean Shores

17:20.580 --> 17:22.165
equals the craziest
Squid I've ever <i> seen.</i>

17:26.086 --> 17:27.003
(<i> grunting</i> )

17:27.087 --> 17:30.966
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Sammy on the rocks.

17:31.049 --> 17:31.925
{\an3}Ow!

17:32.009 --> 17:32.676
{\an1}(<i> laughing</i> ):
Wuss!

17:32.760 --> 17:36.305
Nobody snowballs <i> my</i> bud.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.681
{\an5}(<i> grunting</i> )

17:36.388 --> 17:37.681
{\an3}Yeah!

17:37.765 --> 17:42.394
(<i> laughing and yelling</i> )

17:42.478 --> 17:45.230
Dude, what's all
the mayhem, now?

17:45.314 --> 17:48.192
Madtown is closed 'cause
of the snow, don't you know?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.321
I don't like
the look of this.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.829
(<i> gasping</i> )

18:00.913 --> 18:03.081
I'll <i> never</i> make it up that hill.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.209
There's got to be a shortcut.

18:13.217 --> 18:17.221
Sure never thought
I'd see the Shore Shack

18:17.304 --> 18:18.388
covered in snow.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.975
Yeah, it makes it look
so white and frosty.

18:23.101 --> 18:25.521
Okay, you guys,
get a load of this.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.480
Whoo-hoo!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.357
{\an3}Whoa!

18:28.440 --> 18:30.692
Go, Sam!

18:30.776 --> 18:34.863
Say, Sammy, I think you
just gave me a great idea.

18:39.827 --> 18:44.206
All right, El Nada,
it's just you... and me.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.174
(<i> giggling and humming</i> )

18:58.637 --> 19:00.055
Violet! Get in here.

19:00.138 --> 19:04.393
The news warned there
may be looters about.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.728
Oh, Merv, calm down.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.646
For once I'm actually <i> glad</i>

19:07.729 --> 19:10.065
you're too cheap
to heat the pool.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.733
Cheap?!

19:11.817 --> 19:15.696
Do you think stockpiling
this much emergency goods

19:15.779 --> 19:16.321
has been cheap?

19:20.868 --> 19:23.745
{\an1}You guys ready for a <i> real</i>
game of ice hockey?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.707
But we don't
have any gear.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.588
Hey.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.631
We can use these
as sticks.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.134
And this looks like
a puck to me.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.969
Good thinking,
Sammy.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.307
Hey, Whoa, Whoa.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.308
{\an3}Whoa!

19:46.476 --> 19:47.352
Yes!

19:47.436 --> 19:49.771
{\an5}Whoa...

19:47.436 --> 19:49.771
{\an1}Whoa...

19:49.855 --> 19:52.107
I can't even move!

19:52.190 --> 19:53.567
(<i> yelling</i> )

19:53.650 --> 19:56.778
In the Midwest...
you're <i> born</i> with these skills.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.197
All:
Whoa!

20:01.533 --> 20:07.164
Oh, this hill is even steeper
than the last one.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.380
{\an3}Tito?

20:15.464 --> 20:15.881
{\an1}Raymundo!

20:15.964 --> 20:17.716
Keep talking!

20:17.799 --> 20:19.885
I'm going to follow
the sound of your voice.

20:19.968 --> 20:23.805
Over here, brother!

20:26.224 --> 20:28.268
{\an3}Tito!

20:28.352 --> 20:29.311
Is that you?

20:29.394 --> 20:33.857
Oh, man, El Nada is
really kicking in.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.359
It's too dangerous to go
on right now, Tito

20:35.442 --> 20:39.404
We better just wait here
for a rescue squad.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.280
I agree, brother.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.950
We may have to build
an ice cave.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.118
{\an1}I just hope the kids have
been picked up already.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.454
I'm sure the kids
are fine, brother

20:47.537 --> 20:50.165
{\an1}but we better not
put <i> ourselves</i> at risk.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.959
Oh, absolutely.

20:59.800 --> 21:04.471
Cadets,<i> that</i> is the
sorriest excuse for a snowman

21:04.554 --> 21:05.806
I've ever seen.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.224
I recommend you take a look
at <i> my</i> handy work

21:07.307 --> 21:10.352
and prepare for some
basic training.

21:13.939 --> 21:14.940
What the... ?

21:15.023 --> 21:18.193
Attention!
Lock your heels, snowman.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.362
{\an4}No slack allowed
in my outfit.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.531
I think our snow day
is just about over.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.325
Yeah, it's warming up fast.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.369
But I've got one more thing
I want to show you

21:27.452 --> 21:28.578
back at the cul-de-sac.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.746
The snow'll be gone by
the time we get there.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.708
Just come on.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.005
Tito, in case we don't
make it out of this,

21:38.088 --> 21:40.382
I want you to know...

21:40.465 --> 21:42.217
{\an5}(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I ate the last piece
of coconut pie

21:42.300 --> 21:43.635
you were saving
the other night.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.013
{\an1}You <i> what?!</i>

21:46.096 --> 21:48.056
Hey, you two
all right?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.392
{\an1}Officer Shirley?
Is that you?

21:50.475 --> 21:54.229
Whoo! We're saved, brother.
We survived El Nada!

21:54.312 --> 21:56.273
(<i> laughter</i> )

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
You're sure

21:58.817 --> 22:00.277
{\an1}you saw the kids
out there, Shirley?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.070
Ray, for the thousandth
time, yes.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.071
(<i> kids laughing</i> )

22:03.155 --> 22:04.990
Look, here they come now.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.242
{\an1}I'm so glad
you kids made it.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.746
We had the raddest
day, Raymundo.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.165
{\an1}Yeah, Sammy knew about all
sorts of cool snow stuff

22:13.248 --> 22:14.958
{\an1}we never even
thought of before.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.209
{\an3}Yeah.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.128
But so much for whatever
you were going to show us.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.004
Yeah, Squid,
I told you

22:19.087 --> 22:20.839
all the snow
would be gone.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.591
If you say so, Otto.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.136
{\an4}(<i> sighing</i> ):
I'm just glad
the ordeal is over.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.262
{\an3}<i>Ordeal?</i>

22:27.346 --> 22:29.014
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, come on, Tito.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.975
{\an1}Don't tell me you were
actually <i> scared</i> out there?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.478
With <i> you</i> taking charge
of the situation?

22:34.561 --> 22:35.437
No way, brother.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.981
Where'd Sammy go?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.107
Ooh!

22:39.191 --> 22:40.609
(<i> laughter</i> )

22:40.692 --> 22:42.277
"No more snow," huh, Otto?

22:42.360 --> 22:45.363
You are <i> so</i> going down, Sammy.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.698
{\an4}Yeah!

22:45.447 --> 22:46.698
All right!

22:46.782 --> 22:47.365
Whoo-hoo!

22:47.449 --> 22:49.117
(<i> cheering</i> )

22:49.201 --> 22:52.454
{\an4}Whoa! Hey!

22:49.201 --> 22:52.454
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:52.537 --> 22:54.790
(<i> cheering and yelling</i> )
