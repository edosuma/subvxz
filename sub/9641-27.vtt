WEBVTT

00:08.708 --> 00:10.583
Five eleven is your change.

00:10.583 --> 00:13.125
Um, did you look at
the bill I gave you?

00:13.125 --> 00:16.250
Uh, yes, I gave you
change for two 20s.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.125
I know,
but take a good look at it,

00:19.125 --> 00:20.958
'cause I wrote my
phone number on it.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.000
Intentionally marking currency
is a federal offense.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.291
Look, it was just
my silly way

00:29.291 --> 00:31.125
of seeing if you'd like
to go out some time.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.375
My name's Sara.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.500
Look, uh...
Sara, I'm sorry.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.000
It's just that you remind me
of my old girlfriend.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.625
She was a girl, too.

00:47.583 --> 00:50.000
Looks like I got a lot
in common with her.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Because I'm also a girl...

00:52.000 --> 00:53.583
...who thinks you're cute.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.000
Oh, great.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.750
Now you're exactly like her.
She thought I was cute, too.

00:59.291 --> 01:01.250
What else? Do you
like my clammy hands?

01:01.250 --> 01:03.875
She loved my clammy hands.
Go ahead, feel my clammy hands!

01:03.875 --> 01:06.625
Wow! That was
a little dramatic.

01:06.625 --> 01:10.250
Good thing your next
girlfriend likes drama.

01:12.416 --> 01:14.458
Call me.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.833
we used to do that, too!

01:22.208 --> 01:24.500
Oh my gosh, that cute girl
was totally into you.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.000
How could you just
blow her off like that?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.166
Because an appropriate amount
of time has not passed

01:28.166 --> 01:29.958
since I lost Juliet.

01:29.958 --> 01:32.083
And that appropriate amount
of time will be in the year...

01:32.083 --> 01:34.333
...two thousand and never!

01:37.083 --> 01:39.333
Justin, I know you're
hurting from losing Juliet,

01:39.333 --> 01:40.875
but you've got to find
a way to move on.

01:40.875 --> 01:45.166
Son, I remember
when John Bender,

01:45.166 --> 01:47.125
Benjamin Kenobi, Ponyboy, and I

01:47.125 --> 01:48.875
were all in love
with the same girl.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.458
Mary-Ann Delou.

01:51.458 --> 01:52.875
And I had to just
face the fact

01:52.875 --> 01:54.750
that they had cool names
and I didn't.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.000
And it was... Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.750
You're thinking this story
has nothing to do

01:58.750 --> 02:00.958
with your situation.
And you're probably right.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.958
But I got stuff going on too,

02:03.958 --> 02:06.458
and sometimes I need
to talk about it.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.375
There were so many things I
wanted to do with Juliet.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.250
Like... Like see
the Grand Canyon,

02:19.250 --> 02:21.083
or swim with dolphins.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.875
I didn't even get to
take her on a boat ride in
Central Park for her birthday.

02:24.875 --> 02:28.250
Oh, look, dude, the chick got
scratched by a werewolf, OK?

02:28.250 --> 02:31.625
She turned old,
like, 2,193 years old,

02:31.625 --> 02:35.000
and then dragged her wrinkly
self into the woods forever.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.416
Let her go.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.458
OK, first of all,
it's 2,194 tomorrow.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.500
Maybe that's why I'm so upset!

02:43.500 --> 02:46.583
Maybe that's why I could use
a little sympathy from you guys.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.708
Alex, take it easy on him.

02:51.708 --> 02:54.833
Look, sometimes you just gotta
yank the bandage right off.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.250
That's what I did
with Mason.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.875
It was hard, but I'm ready
for my next relationship now.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.958
And I know when it happens,
we're gonna be together forever.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.291
Oh, it's a tent?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.083
Thought the package said
it was a life raft.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.000
Hey, guys, I need something
to put my camping stuff in.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.458
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.750
Camping sounds like
so much fun.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.375
You know, sleeping under
the stars in Central Park,

04:26.375 --> 04:30.333
with three million other New
Yorkers just one zipper away
from attacking you.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.250
That's why I'm gonna
lay down this bubble wrap

04:33.250 --> 04:36.625
all around the perimeter
of this tent.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.208
One pop and I'm outta there.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.458
I could move faster if I had
a shirt with a pocket

04:43.458 --> 04:45.166
big enough to hold
all my stuff in it, though.

04:45.166 --> 04:49.000
Why don't you just
wear your backpack, Max?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.875
Alex,
a backpack without a shirt?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.708
Come on, I'd be freezing.

04:53.708 --> 04:56.625
Not to mention the chafing from
when I'm running from attackers.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.708
Backpack shirt.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.375
I'm on it. Come on, Alex.
You're gonna help me.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.500
Oh, I'm not
helping you with that.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.458
Excuse me, sir. Pardon me.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.583
Max, did you just
see Juliet walk by?

05:37.583 --> 05:40.708
Juliet? You mean,
the one who got really old,

05:40.708 --> 05:42.875
hobbled off into the woods
and you're never gonna
see again?

05:42.875 --> 05:45.708
- Yeah, that's the one.
- No, I don't remember her.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.625
Maybe I didn't see her either.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.750
Oh, wait a minute.
You got a camping box, too?

05:53.750 --> 05:55.708
All right, don't get jealous,

05:55.708 --> 05:58.458
but Harper's making me
a shirt to hold all my stuff in.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.416
Max, I really don't have time
for your randomness right now.

06:01.416 --> 06:03.958
So why don't you just
put your junk in a backpack?

06:03.958 --> 06:06.208
Because, if I put a backpack on,
there's a pretty good chance

06:06.208 --> 06:08.000
I may just walk
straight to school.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.125
I'll be on my way.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.458
Justin?

06:17.458 --> 06:20.000
It's me. Juliet.

06:21.708 --> 06:24.125
- Juliet?
- I'm back.

06:27.291 --> 06:30.083
- Is it you?
- Yes.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.708
It can't be.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.000
- I must be dreaming.
- No, no, it is.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.875
It's your Snoogly-Boo-Boo
McCuteykins.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.583
Snoogly-Boo-Boo McCuteykins!

06:43.000 --> 06:45.708
Oh, my gosh! It is you!

06:45.708 --> 06:48.083
Juliet, you look great!
You're young again!

06:48.083 --> 06:49.875
What kind of moisturizer
are you using?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.208
I need to get me
some of that.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.708
OK, wait a minute.
How'd this happen?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.250
Uh... Lollipop.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.458
- What?
- Cream cheese.

07:03.458 --> 07:04.625
What's going on with you?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.708
OK, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

07:07.708 --> 07:09.583
I'm just so happy to see you.

07:09.583 --> 07:12.416
So many people told me
to just move on and let go,

07:12.416 --> 07:14.416
but I knew there was
a reason why I shouldn't.

07:14.416 --> 07:16.166
And this is it.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.333
I was right not to let go.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.625
No, no, Justin,
that's why I came back.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.000
To tell you
it's OK to let go.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.416
What are you talking about?
That doesn't make any sense.

07:25.416 --> 07:28.375
You're right.
It doesn't make any sense.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.875
Let's talk about this later.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.708
Wait, no, no, no.
You can't leave.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.083
I still want to take you on
a boat ride in Central Park

07:34.083 --> 07:35.833
and we can have
a picnic on the rocks.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.625
We were gonna do it for your
birthday, and we still can.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.958
- I'll meet you
in the park tonight, OK?
- OK.

07:43.416 --> 07:45.875
Yes! My Juliet's back!

07:45.875 --> 07:47.125
Whoo-hoo!

07:48.708 --> 07:51.416
Hey, Dad, can I
have this soup ladle?

07:51.416 --> 07:53.291
I think it'll be perfect
for when I'm out

07:53.291 --> 07:54.875
ladling things in the wild.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.291
Max, what do you think
ladling is?

08:02.416 --> 08:05.125
What that has to do
with soup, I have no idea.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.000
Attention, everyone!
My true love has returned!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.125
And she's not
2,000 years old anymore!

08:15.125 --> 08:16.208
Which is...

08:20.166 --> 08:22.125
Justin, what is going on?

08:22.125 --> 08:24.583
Juliet's back. I just
bumped into her outside.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.000
We have a date tonight.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.958
I thought Juliet turned old
and hobbled into the forest.

08:28.958 --> 08:31.458
No, she did. But apparently
our love overcame all that.

08:31.458 --> 08:35.250
Oh, my gosh! Juliet is back!
This is so exciting!

08:35.250 --> 08:37.708
Juliet's back! Yay!
Guess what?

08:37.708 --> 08:40.333
Juliet's back!
She's back! She's...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.833
Justin, I promised your father

08:44.833 --> 08:47.208
I wasn't gonna badmouth
magic anymore, but sweetie,

08:47.208 --> 08:50.208
this doesn't add up.
And when things don't add up,

08:50.208 --> 08:52.000
it's because there's
usually magic involved.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.250
And when there's magic involved,
nothing good ever happens!

08:57.416 --> 08:59.416
There. I said it.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.833
I'm not badmouthing magic,

09:01.833 --> 09:03.333
I'm just stating the facts.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.458
Mom's right. This is weird.

09:07.458 --> 09:11.000
Have we learned nothing from
Dad's Mary-Ann Delou story?

09:11.833 --> 09:14.833
Mary-Ann Delou?

09:14.833 --> 09:17.625
So you're still thinking
about her? Huh?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.166
I... I was trying
to help my son.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.333
Moving on. It's healthy.
Tell her, Justin.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.500
Sometimes if you don't
move on, they come right back.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.375
What? Wait. Honey!

09:29.375 --> 09:31.708
I think what Justin's
trying to say

09:31.708 --> 09:33.333
is that when people come back,

09:33.333 --> 09:35.250
it's because they have something
very important to say,

09:35.250 --> 09:36.875
and you should listen to them.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.375
Because they might say
something like,

09:38.375 --> 09:40.500
"It's time to move on!"

09:43.166 --> 09:44.833
Hey, look what I made!

09:46.250 --> 09:48.333
It's Max's backpack shirt.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.833
It's pretty exciting.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.583
Great! Now, I am all set
to go camping in the park.

10:10.833 --> 10:13.166
I can't believe
you're here right now.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.833
I actually thought
I'd never see you again.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.708
Yeah... And, um...

10:17.708 --> 10:20.500
I know, sometimes people
come back for a reason.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.416
Um... You know how I was
talking to you earlier

10:23.416 --> 10:25.708
- about moving on?
- Oh, I know.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.250
Crazy, right?
It's a good thing I didn't.

10:31.583 --> 10:35.708
Juliet, we need
to run away and be together.

10:35.708 --> 10:37.583
- What?
- Look...

10:37.583 --> 10:40.583
We need to get away
from all this wizards
and vampires stuff.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.208
You know where we should go?

10:43.208 --> 10:45.583
Missoula, Montana!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.875
Wait, so, you mean,
just you and me?

10:48.875 --> 10:50.000
Yes, it'll be great!

10:50.000 --> 10:52.458
No one around to tell
us it's a crazy idea.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.125
Because we're meant
to be together.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.958
It's gonna be so much fun.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.625
Oh, that would be
so much fun.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.458
I know! And we can
live on a ranch.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.875
And... And I hear they have
a historical Old West
reenactment town.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.208
We can get jobs there!

11:05.208 --> 11:07.875
You as a cancan girl,
and me as the piano player.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.458
But I wouldn't have to play,
because it's automatic!

11:10.458 --> 11:13.125
It just...

11:16.416 --> 11:18.833
It's a reenactment town?
That's costumes, right?

11:18.833 --> 11:20.291
And we wouldn't
have to tell Alex?

11:20.291 --> 11:21.583
We wouldn't
have to tell anyone.

11:21.583 --> 11:24.458
We can get on my dad's magic
flying carpet and we can go.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.958
- Right now.
- Oh, Justin.

11:30.166 --> 11:34.000
Oh, I can't kiss you
or go away with you.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.333
Why not?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.166
Because I'm in love
with Zeke.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.375
You're in love with Zeke?

11:43.625 --> 11:45.875
It's because he can
do a back flip, isn't it?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.583
I knew I should have taken
that tumbling class with him

11:49.583 --> 11:51.000
when I had the chance.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.125
Um...

11:55.000 --> 11:56.500
I'm not Juliet.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.000
I'm Harper.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.500
What?!

12:03.833 --> 12:04.833
You...!

12:09.583 --> 12:11.750
Well, that explains
the skipper outfit, I guess.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, I made it myself.
Do you like it?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.458
Excuse me for just one second.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.958
You could have just said no.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.833
Why would you
do this, Harper?

12:39.833 --> 12:41.625
I thought I was getting
reunited with my girlfriend!

12:41.625 --> 12:43.166
I was trying to help you.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.708
You have a really deranged
idea of what help is.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.875
Wait a minute, are you Alex
pretending to be Harper

12:48.875 --> 12:51.708
pretending to be Juliet?
'Cause that's just sick.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.500
No, no, it really
is me, Harper.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.708
If I was Alex, I would've
sunk the boat in the middle
of the lake.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.125
Yeah, that's true.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.958
Look, it all started off

13:00.958 --> 13:04.208
when that girl was flirting
with you at the Sub Station,
remember?

13:04.208 --> 13:06.708
OK, let's stare at the tree
and I'll explain more.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.333
Are you really gonna make Max
that stupid backpack shirt?

13:14.333 --> 13:17.500
No. A backpack shirt
would be embarrassing.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.083
And that hat?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.750
Oh, don't start with me!

13:22.375 --> 13:23.833
I just wanted
to get you into the lair.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.958
I can't stand
to see Justin like this.

13:25.958 --> 13:28.875
Well, I can't stand to see
Justin hardly at all.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.416
But I've gotten used to it,
and so should you,

13:31.416 --> 13:33.375
because Juliet
is not coming back.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.291
- Or is she?
- No, she's not.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.291
Didn't you see her
hobble off into the woods?

13:38.291 --> 13:39.750
I think Mason ate her.

13:42.416 --> 13:43.833
All right, here's a thought.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.875
Justin needs to move on,
and if he can't hear it
from us,

13:46.875 --> 13:49.125
maybe he needs
to hear it from Juliet.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.000
But he already did
hear it from her.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.708
The old lady version of her.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.583
Yeah, but come on,
who listens to old people?

13:54.583 --> 13:58.166
What if you made me look like
Juliet, and then she told him?

13:58.166 --> 14:01.125
Harper, that doesn't sound
like you want to help Justin.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.583
That sounds like you
want to date him.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.250
Oh, that's not it.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.583
Why is it so hard
to get you Russos

14:05.583 --> 14:07.250
to do something
nice for each other?

14:07.250 --> 14:09.458
Because, when you're doing
something nice for someone,

14:09.458 --> 14:11.458
your guard is down.
And that's when another Russo

14:11.458 --> 14:13.750
will come right
behind you and trip you.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.958
OK, fine, I'll do it,

14:17.958 --> 14:20.000
but only because you're
doing all the work.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.625
I'm just waving a wand.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.166
Transfix. Transpose.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.416
Make Harper look like Juliet,
from head to toe.

14:26.416 --> 14:29.583
Huh? How do I look?

14:32.083 --> 14:33.875
You look great. You look great.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.583
Um...

14:36.875 --> 14:38.875
This is a lot more
work than I thought.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.708
OK, all right.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.708
Transfix. Transpose.
Make Harper look like

14:42.708 --> 14:44.583
young Juliet,
including the clothes.

14:47.291 --> 14:48.500
There you go.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.708
Testing, testing.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.375
I even have Juliet's voice.

14:54.416 --> 14:57.500
I pale in comparison
to Harper Finkle.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.708
I've always wanted
to hear her say that.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.708
OK, now go and
walk around Waverly Place

15:02.708 --> 15:04.125
until you bump into Justin.

15:04.125 --> 15:07.458
And I'll tell him that he should
just move on from Juliet.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.750
We'll have a moment,
but that will be it.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.875
Oh, what should we do about
the backpack shirt for Max?

15:12.875 --> 15:15.458
I'll... I'll throw
something together.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.333
OK, just make sure it's
not shoddy workmanship.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.708
It's Harper that's making that.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.125
Don't push it, blondie.

15:23.416 --> 15:26.291
So when Alex
turned me into Juliet,
I had good intentions.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.458
But then you started asking all
those questions and I panicked.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.166
Excuse me, sir. Pardon me.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.708
Max, did you just
see Juliet walk by?

15:42.125 --> 15:43.708
Psst!

15:45.833 --> 15:48.458
What are you doing? You're
supposed to be with Justin.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.583
I panicked.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.958
Hey, my part of this
was just waving a wand.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.458
Now I have to
motivate you, too?

15:53.458 --> 15:55.250
But what if he starts
asking me questions

15:55.250 --> 15:56.583
before I can tell
him to move on?

15:56.583 --> 15:58.458
Like... how I became young,

15:58.458 --> 16:00.250
or how I got back?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.708
Just do what I do when people
ask me for answers I don't know.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.750
Just say random words
until they change the subject.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.958
- You sure that's gonna work?
- Lollipop.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.583
Can't get any more
random than that.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.375
- Cream cheese.
- You just did.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.250
Ooh, that totally works!

16:14.250 --> 16:16.583
OK.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.875
- I'm going back in.
- Good girl.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.458
Justin. It's me.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.000
Juliet.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.208
You knew it was wrong
to mess with my feelings!

16:34.208 --> 16:36.125
No, I hadn't fully
thought out my scheme.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.250
So you admit it was a scheme!

16:37.250 --> 16:38.875
- Can I finish?
- You may.

16:41.708 --> 16:43.583
I'll meet you
in the park tonight, OK?

16:44.500 --> 16:47.000
Yes! My Juliet's back!

16:47.000 --> 16:49.416
- So, how did it go?
- Pretty good.

16:49.416 --> 16:52.083
- So you told him to move on?
- OK, not pretty good.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.333
Good. OK, a little
less than good.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.000
But not bad. We have a date
tonight at the boat pond.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.333
A date?

16:59.333 --> 17:00.958
Harper, that wasn't the plan!

17:00.958 --> 17:03.583
OK, I'll just go
on the date with Justin

17:03.583 --> 17:06.333
- and tell him to move on.
- Fine.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.625
Can you change me
back to Harper?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.750
I hate dressing this drab.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.875
Whoo-hoo!
Juliet's back! Juliet's back!

17:14.458 --> 17:15.875
Transfix. Transpose.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.833
Make Harper look like herself,
including the clothes.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.208
OK!

17:23.375 --> 17:24.750
Juliet's back.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.125
I just bumped into her outside.
We have a date later tonight.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.875
Oh my gosh, he's telling
your parents about Juliet.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.166
They're gonna know it was me.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.625
No, they won't.
Just act surprised.

17:32.625 --> 17:33.875
...hobbled off
into the forest.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.458
She did! Our love
overcame all that.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.250
Oh, my gosh! Juliet is back!

17:38.250 --> 17:40.000
This is so exciting!

17:40.000 --> 17:44.291
Juliet's back! Yay! Guess what?
Juliet's back! She's back!

17:47.375 --> 17:49.375
Justin, I promised your father

17:49.375 --> 17:51.875
I wasn't gonna badmouth magic
anymore, but sweetie,

17:51.875 --> 17:53.458
this doesn't add up.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.708
- How'd I do?
- Mom's suspicious.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.000
We need to throw her
off our trail.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.458
Should I say some
random stuff?

17:58.458 --> 18:00.458
No. Dad's trying
to do something nice.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.291
Time to trip him
from behind.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.125
I'm not badmouthing magic,
I'm just stating the facts.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.083
Mom's right.
I mean, this is weird.

18:09.083 --> 18:13.000
Have we learned nothing from
Dad's Mary-Ann Delou story?

18:14.458 --> 18:17.625
Mary-Ann Delou?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.833
So you're still
thinking about her?

18:21.083 --> 18:23.291
I... I was just trying
to help my son.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.416
Moving on. It's healthy.
Tell her, Justin.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.708
Sometimes if you don't move on,
they come right back.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.708
What? Wait!

18:32.250 --> 18:34.583
I think what Justin's
trying to say

18:34.583 --> 18:36.291
is that when people come back,

18:36.291 --> 18:38.125
it's because they have
something very important to say,

18:38.125 --> 18:39.750
and you should listen to them.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.375
Because they might
say something like,

18:41.375 --> 18:43.458
"It's time to move on."

18:43.458 --> 18:45.625
Harper, stop talking!

18:47.375 --> 18:48.750
But I still don't understand
how you thought

18:48.750 --> 18:51.458
bringing a pretend Juliet
back into my life would help.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.500
You weren't moving on,

18:54.500 --> 18:56.875
and I thought you needed
to hear it from the person

18:56.875 --> 18:58.291
you were still in love with.

19:00.416 --> 19:02.208
It's time.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.500
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.958
I mean, where...
Where's a guy like me

19:07.958 --> 19:10.291
gonna find a girl
like that again?

19:10.291 --> 19:13.458
You probably won't
find a girl like her again.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.166
But that doesn't mean you won't
find a girl you'll like again.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.291
She's out there somewhere.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.458
You just have to be open
to finding her.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.000
Wait, you're... you're not
supposed to kiss Juliet.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.333
You're supposed
to be getting over her.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.291
I know.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.000
That wasn't for Juliet.

19:38.583 --> 19:39.875
It was for you, Harper.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.458
Thank you.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.708
No problem.

19:49.083 --> 19:50.875
Transfix. Transpose.

19:50.875 --> 19:53.708
Make Harper look like herself
again, including the clothes.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.833
Thank you.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.500
And, when you kissed me,
I was Juliet,

19:58.500 --> 20:00.625
so Zeke does not need
to know about this.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.583
You know what, Harper?

20:06.708 --> 20:08.166
I am gonna move on.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.833
I think a part of me
will always love Juliet.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.583
Help! My shoe!

20:13.583 --> 20:15.250
Help me! Help me!

20:19.291 --> 20:21.250
The tools in this thing
are in the back.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.625
This is not a good design.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.208
Yeah, it's not.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.000
You know, Alex made that.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.208
Bravo! Bravo!

20:34.708 --> 20:37.583
It's the best
backpack shirt ever.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.875
Harper, help him down.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.708
Justin, be ready to trip him!

20:49.125 --> 20:50.750
Ooh, I, uh...

20:50.750 --> 20:52.750
I should have told you
to wear flip-flops.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.833
I don't want you
to get your shoes wet.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.083
You could...
You could carry me.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.250
Oh.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.375
Yes...

21:01.375 --> 21:02.583
I could do that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.625
I'm... I'm so sorry.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.375
- Are you OK?
- Yes, you broke my fall.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.750
- Are you OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm better.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.583
- Good.
- I meant emotionally.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.083
My knee is jacked up.
