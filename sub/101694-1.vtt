WEBVTT

02:04.248 --> 02:06.082
Now to the 18th.

02:06.115 --> 02:07.652
And our leader with
a two shot lead,

02:07.685 --> 02:10.253
he has a difficult 20
footer for a birdie.

02:10.287 --> 02:11.789
That's my boy.

02:11.822 --> 02:13.324
Really
puts the pressure.

02:13.356 --> 02:14.391
Put it in the hole.

02:15.526 --> 02:16.761
Good speed.

02:16.794 --> 02:18.429
Put it in the hole.

02:18.461 --> 02:20.997
Just
lifted, a tap in for par.

02:21.031 --> 02:23.634
Hi, Mr. Bona,
how are you today?

02:23.667 --> 02:25.603
Same as I was yesterday.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.671
And last week and last month.

02:27.705 --> 02:29.307
Why do you keep asking me?

02:29.340 --> 02:31.609
'Cause you sit outside
by yourself all the time.

02:31.641 --> 02:32.810
You look so sad.

02:32.842 --> 02:33.710
I'm fine.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.212
I'm listening to the game.

02:36.246 --> 02:37.581
How about you run along?

02:37.614 --> 02:40.217
You know I'm gonna
check on you later.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.419
Do whatever you want.

02:45.521 --> 02:46.356
Sweet kid.

02:54.865 --> 02:57.969
He missed a four foot
putt?

02:59.502 --> 03:02.239
I could have made that
blindfolded in my old days.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.576
Five years in a
row, you won the local cup.

03:39.610 --> 03:40.911
Congratulations.

03:40.943 --> 03:42.045
Right on.

04:01.998 --> 04:03.199
Sarah.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.935
Come on in and get
your homework done.

04:04.967 --> 04:05.769
I'm coming.

04:08.305 --> 04:10.408
Sarah, I don't get what
you find so interesting

04:10.441 --> 04:11.376
about that man.

04:12.508 --> 04:14.478
You're over there every
time I turn around.

04:15.778 --> 04:18.249
I don't think he has
any family, Grandma.

04:18.281 --> 04:20.350
He's a grumpy old man

04:20.384 --> 04:23.788
and I just don't see what
see is so fun about him.

04:23.821 --> 04:25.823
I just miss Mommy and Daddy.

04:25.855 --> 04:27.957
Aw, I do too.

04:27.990 --> 04:30.161
Things are gonna get better.

04:30.194 --> 04:31.795
We'll get through this together.

04:33.430 --> 04:36.167
Now, come on in
the house, wash up

04:36.199 --> 04:37.200
and get your homework done.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.168
Okay, Grandma.

04:38.201 --> 04:39.103
I already did my homework.

04:39.136 --> 04:40.605
Oh, that's my girl.

04:53.649 --> 04:56.653
Yeah.

05:05.062 --> 05:05.896
Eh.

05:06.963 --> 05:07.798
What else.

05:16.874 --> 05:20.711
Another visit
from trailer park security.

05:20.744 --> 05:22.146
You're funny, Mr. Bona.

05:22.178 --> 05:24.314
I have a very interesting
question for you.

05:24.348 --> 05:26.884
Why do you keep bothering
me all the time?

05:26.916 --> 05:28.852
I wouldn't call it that.

05:28.886 --> 05:30.454
Why don't you play some music?

05:30.487 --> 05:31.555
I don't like music.

05:31.588 --> 05:32.957
I like sports.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.391
I prefer golf.

05:34.423 --> 05:36.359
I played golf a long
time ago but not anymore.

05:36.392 --> 05:37.827
But that's a radio.

05:37.860 --> 05:40.831
That's what you're supposed
to do, listen to music.

05:40.863 --> 05:41.865
You ask too many questions.

05:41.899 --> 05:43.334
Time for you to skedaddle.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.602
To what?

05:44.634 --> 05:45.802
What does that mean?

05:45.836 --> 05:47.504
Skedaddle means go.

05:47.538 --> 05:49.173
You must leave now.

05:49.206 --> 05:51.075
You're funny even
when you're not trying.

05:51.108 --> 05:52.276
I'll be seeing you, kid.

05:52.309 --> 05:53.978
It's time for me to
take my middle age nap.

05:54.011 --> 05:55.780
There you go
again, you're funny.

06:00.783 --> 06:01.918
I got to quit.

06:01.951 --> 06:03.487
Eh, nah.

06:03.519 --> 06:04.354
I'm fine.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.424
Take this with me.

06:07.456 --> 06:09.192
Ah, nah, I'm thirsty.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.168
Mr. Bona?

06:52.735 --> 06:53.570
Mr. Bona?

07:30.374 --> 07:32.543
What are you doing here?

07:33.442 --> 07:34.344
You gonna answer me?

07:34.377 --> 07:35.712
What are you doing in my house?

07:35.745 --> 07:38.081
You dropped mail
and I was just-

07:38.115 --> 07:39.682
- What's that in your hand?

07:39.716 --> 07:41.151
It's a golf ball?

07:41.184 --> 07:42.086
It's pink.

07:45.288 --> 07:48.525
Do not ever, ever
touch that ball again!

07:48.557 --> 07:50.593
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

07:50.627 --> 07:52.730
This ball is
never to be touched.

07:52.762 --> 07:54.864
You have no right
being in my home

07:54.898 --> 07:56.700
let alone touching my things.

07:56.733 --> 07:58.435
Now get out of here!

07:58.468 --> 07:59.302
I'm sorry.

08:47.951 --> 08:51.522
The kids and I are going
shopping, you wanna come?

08:51.554 --> 08:52.789
Nah, I can't.

08:52.822 --> 08:54.692
I gotta review these
papers for morning.

08:54.725 --> 08:56.659
Why do you keep slaving
day in and day out

08:56.692 --> 08:58.461
for this company?

08:58.495 --> 09:01.698
You don't need to keep
slaving over this job.

09:01.731 --> 09:02.966
I have an idea.

09:02.999 --> 09:05.668
Kids, please come
here for a minute.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.571
Are we leaving yet?

09:07.604 --> 09:09.807
Come here, I have
an announcement.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.076
This year, I am gonna
give your father

09:13.110 --> 09:15.512
the best Christmas gift ever.

09:15.544 --> 09:17.480
I want you to take a year off

09:17.514 --> 09:19.850
and I want you to
pursue your dreams.

09:19.883 --> 09:21.051
Come on.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.686
If that's write a
book, then write a book.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.023
If it's playing golf
then become a pro.

09:28.658 --> 09:29.493
Okay.

09:31.227 --> 09:32.195
We're gonna go now.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.067
You ready?

09:38.100 --> 09:40.604
Hey, I'm serious
about what I said.

09:41.471 --> 09:43.907
Yeah, you're so sweet.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.609
I'll catch up later.

09:46.543 --> 09:48.445
Yeah.

09:48.477 --> 09:50.246
Love you, honey.

09:50.279 --> 09:52.081
Yeah, I love you too.

09:52.115 --> 09:53.216
Bye daddy.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.250
Bye.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.793
Get off of that
couch, wake up!

10:02.826 --> 10:04.528
Joe, hey.

10:06.763 --> 10:08.865
Don't you think it's time?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.167
Who are you?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.701
How'd you get into my trailer?

10:13.302 --> 10:14.904
Oh, how soon we forget.

10:16.373 --> 10:19.576
By the looks of this place we
got a lot of work to do, Joe.

10:19.609 --> 10:22.346
Well, somebody, I don't
even know who you are.

10:24.514 --> 10:25.850
You look a little familiar.

10:27.517 --> 10:30.954
Well I can see why you
don't remember who I am.

10:30.986 --> 10:32.288
My name is Graham Scott.

10:33.722 --> 10:38.294
At one time I was one of the
best golfers in the world.

10:38.327 --> 10:40.297
But like everything
else in this, well,

10:43.166 --> 10:44.769
everything passes, Joe.

10:46.369 --> 10:49.572
Listen, old man, I think
it's time for you to leave.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.807
Can I get the door for you?

10:50.841 --> 10:54.144
Oh, no, get dressed,
okay?

10:54.177 --> 10:55.111
It's not gonna be easy

10:55.144 --> 10:57.146
to get you back into shape, Joe.

10:57.179 --> 10:59.982
You, my friend, are
going to compete

11:00.015 --> 11:01.684
in the Arizona Open.

11:03.485 --> 11:04.855
Why would I?

11:04.888 --> 11:06.523
I don't play golf anymore.

11:06.556 --> 11:07.724
Oh, come on now.

11:07.756 --> 11:09.292
Why don't you get your
ass off that couch

11:09.326 --> 11:11.295
and let's go to the
driving range, huh?

11:14.063 --> 11:15.998
Don't worry, I'll
grow on you, Joe.

11:16.032 --> 11:16.800
Yeah.

11:16.832 --> 11:17.767
If I have a few balls,

11:17.801 --> 11:19.336
will you leave me alone?

11:19.369 --> 11:22.105
Oh, Joe.

11:22.138 --> 11:25.209
Once you feel that club
connect with that ball

11:26.109 --> 11:27.711
on a perfect drive,

11:29.778 --> 11:32.448
oh, there's nothing better.

11:33.582 --> 11:34.717
And you know it, Joe.

11:36.152 --> 11:36.987
Come on.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.923
Can we get something
to eat first?

11:40.956 --> 11:42.192
Sure.

11:42.225 --> 11:43.326
Why don't you pull
something moldy

11:43.360 --> 11:44.161
out of that
refrigerator of yours

11:44.193 --> 11:45.028
and let's go, huh?

11:46.229 --> 11:48.065
Wait a minute, you
need to shave, Joe.

11:49.532 --> 11:53.537
Yeah, it's time you started
looking somewhat presentable.

11:53.570 --> 11:56.273
Okay?

11:56.306 --> 11:57.107
All right?

11:59.009 --> 12:00.277
I'll wait for you outside.

12:01.410 --> 12:02.812
Come on, chop chop.

12:23.966 --> 12:25.903
I must have been dreaming.

12:59.101 --> 12:59.937
Hello?

13:04.441 --> 13:06.009
Let's go hit some balls.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.715
I dusted off your
clubs, come on.

13:12.682 --> 13:14.151
Yeah I don't know about this.

13:14.183 --> 13:15.151
Yeah you do.

13:18.855 --> 13:19.690
Here we go.

13:23.659 --> 13:25.361
Ah, little gait issue.

13:26.596 --> 13:28.399
Maybe some posture, weight.

13:30.232 --> 13:31.534
We'll work on the posture.

13:33.168 --> 13:34.770
I bet you we will.

13:34.803 --> 13:35.639
Don't worry.

13:36.740 --> 13:37.541
I got this.

13:37.573 --> 13:39.709
No, I got this.

13:41.945 --> 13:43.213
Here we go.

13:51.187 --> 13:53.257
You remember how to
get there, don't you?

13:55.357 --> 13:56.158
Maybe.

14:07.003 --> 14:07.903
Good ball.

14:07.937 --> 14:09.406
That's the one right there.

14:35.331 --> 14:36.133
Remember!

14:37.933 --> 14:38.769
Look at the ball.

14:40.035 --> 14:42.304
Put your weight on your heels.

14:42.337 --> 14:43.573
Excuse me, do you mind?

14:52.481 --> 14:54.650
Oh, I knew that
was gonna happen.

14:54.683 --> 14:56.687
What you will,
you shall receive.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.834
Ugh!

15:11.868 --> 15:12.703
Oh.

15:17.506 --> 15:18.908
Don't worry, Joe.

15:18.942 --> 15:20.443
We'll get you back into shape.

15:23.113 --> 15:23.914
Again.

15:23.947 --> 15:24.782
One second.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.121
Nice swing, kid.

15:33.255 --> 15:34.091
Again.

16:04.287 --> 16:05.388
Mr. Bona?

16:05.421 --> 16:06.456
Mr. Bona.

16:06.489 --> 16:07.958
What happened to you?

16:07.990 --> 16:09.793
Occupational hazard, I guess.

16:09.826 --> 16:10.994
Hmm.

16:11.027 --> 16:12.395
Well Sarah said you
weren't golfing anymore.

16:12.427 --> 16:14.831
Yeah, short-lived, believe me.

16:14.864 --> 16:16.633
Well, the reason I
came over is because

16:16.666 --> 16:17.968
I wanted to apologize.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.401
I am so sorry.

16:19.434 --> 16:22.104
She had no business
being in your home.

16:22.138 --> 16:23.572
Shouldn't walk into
a stranger's home.

16:23.605 --> 16:25.075
What if I was a crazy guy?

16:25.107 --> 16:27.343
Her parents need to teach her
better than that, you know?

16:27.376 --> 16:28.844
I'm Sarah's grandmother

16:28.878 --> 16:30.913
and her parents passed away a
little more than a year ago.

16:30.947 --> 16:34.851
So
sorry, I didn't know.

16:35.717 --> 16:37.286
Hasn't been easy.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.723
I cry myself to sleep
almost every night.

16:42.926 --> 16:44.927
I lost my family 15 years ago.

16:44.961 --> 16:47.831
My wife, my son and
daughter in a car crash.

16:49.065 --> 16:50.934
Something I don't
like talking about.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.437
I am truly sorry.

16:54.671 --> 16:58.408
Well, Sarah said you
have a lot of trophies

16:58.441 --> 16:59.576
and golf memorabilia.

16:59.609 --> 17:01.845
She is fascinated.

17:01.878 --> 17:02.746
I do.

17:03.613 --> 17:04.780
If it's all right with you

17:04.814 --> 17:06.249
I'd like to show
her all that stuff.

17:06.281 --> 17:08.217
I think that
would cheer her up.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.451
Great, anytime.

17:09.484 --> 17:10.753
I'll tell her.

17:10.787 --> 17:12.154
Thank you, Mr. Bona.

17:12.188 --> 17:13.089
You're welcome.

17:13.122 --> 17:14.758
Oh, I have one condition.

17:14.790 --> 17:15.858
You both call me Joe.

17:16.726 --> 17:17.527
Thank you, Joe.

17:17.559 --> 17:18.794
You're welcome.

17:37.012 --> 17:37.847
Come in.

17:40.182 --> 17:41.018
Come in.

17:43.586 --> 17:44.554
Sorry about the other day.

17:44.586 --> 17:45.721
I didn't mean to scare you.

17:45.755 --> 17:47.190
It's okay, I shouldn't
have been in here.

17:47.222 --> 17:48.858
Come on, I'll
show you something.

17:52.194 --> 17:55.231
It's been a long time since
I've shown these to anyone.

17:55.265 --> 17:56.466
Wow.

17:56.499 --> 17:58.835
In this picture
you're kinda fat.

17:58.867 --> 17:59.936
Times like to eat.

18:01.104 --> 18:02.838
Yeah, I won a lot of
tournaments back then.

18:02.872 --> 18:04.441
I got a lot to be grateful for.

18:05.642 --> 18:07.177
If you think that
picture was funny,

18:08.877 --> 18:10.312
I got a lot more to
show you in here.

18:10.346 --> 18:11.548
Come on, let's sit down.

18:14.983 --> 18:17.220
Are you hurting or something?

18:17.252 --> 18:18.754
Let's just say it's old age.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.260
Wow, you were famous.

18:24.294 --> 18:25.495
Yeah not quite.

18:25.528 --> 18:27.998
This is when I won my
third championship.

18:28.030 --> 18:29.365
Boy, it was a big event.

18:30.532 --> 18:34.437
And this right here, oh yeah.

18:35.738 --> 18:37.240
It was a cool invitational.

18:37.272 --> 18:39.609
I could still hear the
crowd like it was yesterday.

18:40.509 --> 18:42.011
Can I ask you a question?

18:42.045 --> 18:43.279
Sure.

18:43.313 --> 18:45.982
That pink golf ball,
what are the letters?

18:46.015 --> 18:48.184
That was my daughter's ball.

18:48.217 --> 18:50.920
She used it for the first
time she ever played golf.

18:50.952 --> 18:52.021
Her name was Maria.

18:52.989 --> 18:53.824
Initials were MB.

18:55.424 --> 18:56.326
Was?

18:56.358 --> 18:57.526
Yeah.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.528
Your grandma told me
about your mom and dad.

18:59.561 --> 19:00.963
I lost my family too.

19:00.997 --> 19:02.198
I hope it wasn't
in a car accident

19:02.230 --> 19:04.134
because that's how
my parents died.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.934
It was.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.470
But you know what, kid?

19:07.502 --> 19:10.072
From now on, you and I are
old friends, best friends.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.308
And you could drive that
little scooter of yours

19:12.342 --> 19:15.145
by here anytime and I won't
tell you to skedaddle.

19:15.178 --> 19:17.414
Just don't ask me a
thousand questions.

19:17.446 --> 19:18.848
Okay, Mr. Bona.

19:20.282 --> 19:21.384
All right, so you know what,

19:21.416 --> 19:22.484
I don't mean to be short or rude

19:22.518 --> 19:24.019
but my back is killing me.

19:24.053 --> 19:24.854
I need to get some rest.

19:24.886 --> 19:26.355
It's okay.

19:26.388 --> 19:27.923
Grandma said I can only be
here for a while anyway.

19:27.957 --> 19:29.225
Okay.

19:29.258 --> 19:30.693
All right kid, thanks.

19:30.727 --> 19:32.028
I'll see you later, Mr. Bona.

19:32.060 --> 19:33.429
I mean, Joe.

19:33.462 --> 19:34.663
Okay.

19:34.696 --> 19:37.366
All right, thanks,
kid.

19:54.150 --> 19:56.886
Today's a new
day, Joe, all right?

19:56.919 --> 19:58.088
We've got a slight wind

19:58.121 --> 19:59.589
that's gonna push
your ball to the right

19:59.622 --> 20:02.659
so I don't wanna see any has
or rockets from you, okay?

20:05.161 --> 20:06.696
Nice.

20:06.729 --> 20:07.797
It's been a long time, old man.

20:07.829 --> 20:08.731
Don't jinx me.

20:10.232 --> 20:11.067
Nice.

20:32.154 --> 20:34.656
Not bad, not bad at all.

20:34.690 --> 20:35.926
I'm racking my brain

20:38.124 --> 20:38.795
trying to figure out
where I know you from.

20:38.827 --> 20:41.230
Oh, why don't you spend some
of that brain racking time

20:41.263 --> 20:43.565
thinking about your game?

20:43.598 --> 20:44.433
Nice hit, man.

20:47.836 --> 20:48.739
Right, we're off.

20:52.642 --> 20:53.610
Somebody put you up to this?

20:53.643 --> 20:54.778
What do you mean?

20:55.912 --> 20:57.579
Why such an interest
in my golf game?

20:57.613 --> 20:59.582
You have the same
problem you've always had.

20:59.615 --> 21:01.451
You don't know how to
count your blessings.

21:03.486 --> 21:04.888
Yeah, there you go again,

21:04.921 --> 21:07.624
it's as if you've
known me my whole life.

21:07.656 --> 21:10.460
One wonderful thing
about being my age, Joe,

21:10.492 --> 21:13.562
is the incredible amount of
wisdom that comes with it.

21:13.596 --> 21:16.598
I know more about you than
you know about yourself.

21:16.632 --> 21:19.001
You're speaking in the
foreign tongues again.

21:20.135 --> 21:21.403
Are you gonna
golf today or what?

21:21.436 --> 21:23.071
You still have a long way to go

21:23.105 --> 21:25.040
to get back to
where you once were.

21:39.922 --> 21:42.558
Just gotta concentrate,
gotta concentrate.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.060
That's what I'm talking about.

21:44.993 --> 21:46.228
That's good, that's good.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.297
Nice and easy.

21:48.564 --> 21:50.700
Okay, that's good, but,

21:50.732 --> 21:51.967
there's still something, okay?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.235
When you're looking this way,

21:53.269 --> 21:54.770
you need to be looking
down at the ball first.

21:54.804 --> 21:55.905
Okay, all right?

21:55.938 --> 21:57.540
Just take a look.

21:57.573 --> 21:59.342
And keep your head
down, don't turn.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.011
Almost, almost.

22:03.045 --> 22:03.947
Okay.

22:03.980 --> 22:04.980
How's your back, huh?

22:05.013 --> 22:05.814
Huh?

22:05.847 --> 22:06.682
Listen.

22:06.715 --> 22:07.550
All right.

22:08.851 --> 22:10.253
Nice and easy, slow.

22:12.855 --> 22:13.655
Okay.

22:13.689 --> 22:14.490
That felt good.

22:14.523 --> 22:15.424
Good, good.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.625
That's what we need, good.

22:18.528 --> 22:19.328
Oh yeah.

22:19.362 --> 22:20.563
Ho ho!

22:20.596 --> 22:23.967
Hey, can I get an
amen!

22:40.549 --> 22:41.451
Here, catch it.

22:41.483 --> 22:43.220
Ah, oh you're dead!

22:44.353 --> 22:46.189
Guys, settle down.

22:46.221 --> 22:47.257
Come on, let me see that.

23:49.417 --> 23:50.586
Hey Mr. Bona.

23:50.619 --> 23:51.920
Grandma said you
were golfing again.

23:51.953 --> 23:52.855
That's great.

23:52.887 --> 23:54.057
Joe, remember?

23:54.089 --> 23:55.357
Oops.

23:55.391 --> 23:56.526
It's a beautiful
Saturday morning.

23:56.558 --> 23:58.193
What are you gonna do, ride
that thing all day long?

23:58.227 --> 23:58.828
Pretty much.

23:58.861 --> 23:59.896
Nothing really else to do.

23:59.929 --> 24:00.830
Hey I got an idea.

24:00.863 --> 24:02.532
Why don't you come golf with me?

24:02.565 --> 24:04.400
You can pretend to be my caddy.

24:04.432 --> 24:05.301
What's a caddy?

24:06.669 --> 24:09.139
Caddy's a person that
carries the clubs and the bag.

24:10.338 --> 24:12.207
But you,
you can't carry it.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.477
You're about the size of a twig.

24:14.509 --> 24:15.711
Should have fun.

24:15.744 --> 24:16.645
That sounds awesome.

24:16.679 --> 24:18.281
But I need to ask Grandma.

24:18.314 --> 24:19.583
I hear you both.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.653
Sarah, you use your best
manners with Mr. Bona.

24:23.685 --> 24:26.455
And you make sure Joe, that you
have her home before supper.

24:26.489 --> 24:28.357
Of course.

24:28.391 --> 24:30.326
Don't take your
eyes off of her.

24:43.172 --> 24:45.775
Out on the golf course, haha.

24:54.150 --> 24:55.451
There's the putting range.

24:56.685 --> 24:58.253
Ah, stop right here.

25:01.289 --> 25:02.892
You're a little
too excited today.

25:02.924 --> 25:05.427
I didn't know golfing could
be so much fun, Mr. Joe.

25:06.796 --> 25:07.764
Hey, get my putter.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.597
Ah, never mind, you don't know

25:08.631 --> 25:09.699
what clubs are yet.

25:09.731 --> 25:10.567
Hold on.

25:14.537 --> 25:15.837
How did you know
it was a putter?

25:15.871 --> 25:17.607
It says putter
right on it, duh.

25:35.990 --> 25:36.792
Do you mind?

25:36.826 --> 25:38.094
I'm trying to putt here.

25:38.126 --> 25:43.133
Sorry.

26:01.683 --> 26:03.051
Shh, Sarah.

26:03.085 --> 26:03.920
Sorry.

26:05.921 --> 26:07.090
You can do it!

26:13.061 --> 26:15.263
Good job, Mr. Bona.

26:15.297 --> 26:17.333
You can't yell out here
while I'm trying to play.

26:17.365 --> 26:18.366
You're making it hard on me.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.870
So please, please

26:21.737 --> 26:23.306
be quiet while I try to shoot.

26:23.338 --> 26:24.540
You got it, I promise.

26:30.645 --> 26:31.580
Good job!

26:31.614 --> 26:33.249
Now, you can yell.

26:33.281 --> 26:34.850
Good job, Mr. Bona.

26:40.122 --> 26:42.826
Okay, here we are, first tee.

26:43.858 --> 26:44.693
Yup.

26:45.961 --> 26:47.963
So put the ball between
the two markers.

26:48.931 --> 26:50.066
And I'm gonna crank it.

26:54.537 --> 26:55.738
Yup.

26:55.770 --> 26:57.240
I'm gonna put it up there.

27:03.945 --> 27:05.380
A little crooked.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.155
All right I'm gonna do this.

27:16.258 --> 27:17.058
Blowing bubbles?

27:17.092 --> 27:18.227
We just got here.

27:18.259 --> 27:21.064
I gotta concentrate
on this, okay?

27:29.704 --> 27:30.773
Good hit, Mr. Bona.

27:32.074 --> 27:33.576
Yeah.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.743
A little weak.

27:34.777 --> 27:37.180
So we got 18, 17 more to go.

27:37.212 --> 27:38.514
Maybe I'll hit a good one.

27:39.414 --> 27:41.416
Let's go back to the cart.

27:41.450 --> 27:42.652
You drive.

27:42.684 --> 27:44.753
Okay there's the ball,
let me get my club.

27:49.490 --> 27:51.528
And my seven iron.

27:52.795 --> 27:55.298
Here we go, all right.

27:55.330 --> 27:56.165
Okay, so.

27:57.199 --> 27:58.901
I have to put it on the green.

27:58.933 --> 28:00.435
See the white flag over there?

28:01.103 --> 28:02.205
- Yeah.
- That's where we're

28:02.238 --> 28:02.939
going with, okay?

28:02.971 --> 28:03.807
Okay.

28:10.479 --> 28:11.547
Ah, sh-

28:12.580 --> 28:13.649
Good job, Mr. Bona.

28:14.782 --> 28:15.951
Good job?

28:15.984 --> 28:17.086
I just fricking
put it in the lake.

28:17.118 --> 28:18.487
Well yeah, but nice form.

28:19.587 --> 28:21.156
Yeah.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.859
I'm too stiff to have nice form.

28:24.026 --> 28:25.561
You know what would
make you loosen up?

28:25.594 --> 28:27.230
The floss, try it.

28:28.329 --> 28:29.397
What the heck?

28:29.431 --> 28:30.399
What do you call that?

28:30.432 --> 28:31.233
The floss.

28:31.267 --> 28:32.067
Like dental floss?

28:32.101 --> 28:33.836
No, it's a dance.

28:33.868 --> 28:34.769
Try it.

28:34.803 --> 28:35.805
All right.

28:40.209 --> 28:41.044
Doh!

28:42.544 --> 28:43.813
Nah, I'm not doing no floss.

28:43.846 --> 28:45.013
Let's go look for
the ball, come on.

28:45.047 --> 28:46.182
Okay, let's go.

28:47.348 --> 28:48.951
Yeah, get in
the car and drive me.

28:48.983 --> 28:49.818
Okay.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.256
Here we go.

28:53.288 --> 28:58.294
Go that way.

28:58.926 --> 28:59.928
Don't put me in the lake.

29:00.628 --> 29:01.263
Thank God.

29:12.074 --> 29:14.343
They got great pie here.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.176
That sounds good.

29:15.210 --> 29:16.645
I think I'll have one.

29:16.679 --> 29:18.714
Hey Joe, how's it going?

29:18.747 --> 29:20.048
Great Murphy, all right.

29:20.082 --> 29:21.484
What, you working all the time?

29:21.517 --> 29:22.451
Never get a day off, do you?

29:22.483 --> 29:23.952
Not with all these snowbirds.

29:23.986 --> 29:26.088
I really need a vacation.

29:26.121 --> 29:28.057
Maybe someplace far away.

29:28.089 --> 29:29.491
Like the Philippines.

29:29.525 --> 29:30.793
Why the Philippines?

29:30.826 --> 29:31.928
Like you don't know?

29:32.795 --> 29:34.163
Who's this kid?

29:34.195 --> 29:35.430
Hello, I'm Sarah.

29:35.463 --> 29:36.898
I live right next
door to Mr. Bona.

29:36.932 --> 29:38.567
Mr. Bona, who's that?

29:38.599 --> 29:39.433
It's me.

29:39.468 --> 29:40.603
So what are you
doing hanging around

29:40.635 --> 29:41.937
with a bum like this?

29:43.105 --> 29:44.307
I'm just kidding, really.

29:44.339 --> 29:45.707
Let me get your
waitress for you.

29:45.740 --> 29:46.808
Jennifer!

29:46.842 --> 29:47.944
Right Murph, thank you.

29:47.977 --> 29:48.778
Thanks a lot.

29:48.810 --> 29:49.645
Always, my friend.

29:51.547 --> 29:52.649
How you doing, guys?

29:55.951 --> 29:57.920
Joe, right?

29:57.952 --> 29:58.954
Do I know you?

29:59.821 --> 30:00.689
Jennifer.

30:01.789 --> 30:03.326
Greene.

30:03.358 --> 30:04.726
Don't you remember me?

30:04.759 --> 30:05.862
Have we met?

30:06.862 --> 30:07.964
Yeah.

30:07.997 --> 30:09.498
Years ago.

30:09.530 --> 30:13.168
You come in, you'd sit at
that same booth everyday.

30:13.201 --> 30:15.136
You'd order coffee.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.506
Cream with two sugars.

30:17.538 --> 30:20.509
The servers used to
call you Two Sugars.

30:20.541 --> 30:22.544
Oh yeah, it's
coming back to me.

30:22.577 --> 30:25.181
That was a long time
ago, 15 years ago.

30:25.213 --> 30:26.915
Man, you got a great memory.

30:28.951 --> 30:31.988
And this must
be your daughter.

30:32.020 --> 30:33.355
No, we're friends.

30:33.388 --> 30:35.023
Well, actually neighbors.

30:35.057 --> 30:36.258
My name's Sarah.

30:36.290 --> 30:37.792
Mr. Bona lives in
the trailer next door

30:37.826 --> 30:39.161
to me and my Grandma.

30:39.193 --> 30:40.363
I wanted to see him golf.

30:40.395 --> 30:41.963
He is a pro.

30:41.997 --> 30:43.532
I'm not a pro.

30:43.565 --> 30:44.866
Let's get this straight.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.268
Let's order.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.535
Okay.

30:47.568 --> 30:48.671
Sarah, how about
we start with you?

30:48.703 --> 30:49.571
What'll it be?

30:49.605 --> 30:52.274
I'll have, let me see.

30:52.307 --> 30:56.278
I think, a slice
of the apple pie,

30:56.310 --> 30:58.646
chicken tenders and an iced tea.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.615
Can I get my pie first please?

31:00.648 --> 31:01.850
What, are you kidding?

31:01.884 --> 31:03.419
What are you from Europe?

31:03.451 --> 31:04.619
That's silly.

31:04.653 --> 31:06.422
Grandma let's me get
desserts before dinner.

31:06.454 --> 31:08.758
Well I think it's
a great choice.

31:08.790 --> 31:10.992
I'll bring out your pie first.

31:11.026 --> 31:12.928
How about for you, Joe?

31:12.961 --> 31:15.830
I'll take the club
sandwich with French fries

31:15.864 --> 31:17.600
and a cup of coffee.

31:17.633 --> 31:18.601
Perfect.

31:18.634 --> 31:19.902
Anything else?

31:21.636 --> 31:22.937
No, thanks.

31:22.971 --> 31:24.173
All right.

31:24.205 --> 31:25.474
I'll have that out
for you right away.

31:26.474 --> 31:27.909
Thank you.

31:27.942 --> 31:29.778
Hey Mr. Bona, guess
who has the hots for you.

31:29.811 --> 31:31.813
The hots, who?

31:31.846 --> 31:33.081
The waitress.

31:33.115 --> 31:34.650
Hopefully she's not a clinger.

31:34.682 --> 31:37.853
She doesn't
have the hots for me.

31:37.885 --> 31:38.788
And what's with
this clinger stuff,

31:38.820 --> 31:40.355
you're only 10 years old!

31:40.388 --> 31:42.023
Everyone knows
what that means.

31:42.057 --> 31:45.326
You should ask her out on a
date sometime, Mr. Two Sugars.

31:45.359 --> 31:46.294
I don't date.

31:46.327 --> 31:47.896
Nobody my age dates.

31:48.797 --> 31:50.031
It's Joe, remember?

31:50.065 --> 31:52.368
And I don't like
that sugar thing.

31:52.401 --> 31:53.769
Okay.

31:53.801 --> 31:55.236
Mr. Two Sugars.

31:55.269 --> 31:57.539
Oh, boy, you're a funny kid.

31:57.573 --> 31:58.941
She's perfect for you.

31:58.973 --> 32:00.842
You're both kinda old.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.478
Oh, you're really
on a roll now.

32:02.510 --> 32:03.778
She's really pretty.

32:03.811 --> 32:04.646
I like her.

32:05.513 --> 32:07.415
Yeah, she's all right but

32:07.449 --> 32:08.683
we gotta change the subject.

32:08.717 --> 32:09.886
So how's about school?

32:11.053 --> 32:12.288
Here you go.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.688
Here you go.

32:13.721 --> 32:15.691
I see you're not
wearing a wedding ring.

32:15.723 --> 32:17.358
Oh.

32:17.392 --> 32:19.795
Yeah no, I'm not married.

32:19.827 --> 32:21.396
See.

32:21.430 --> 32:22.465
I told you.

32:22.498 --> 32:23.865
You told me what?

32:23.898 --> 32:25.200
All right.

32:25.233 --> 32:26.668
What's going on here?

32:26.701 --> 32:29.337
I was telling Joe that
I think you're his type.

32:30.439 --> 32:32.240
Really, mmm.

32:32.273 --> 32:35.444
Well if I remember
correctly, Joe is married.

32:36.711 --> 32:40.215
But I don't see a
ring on that finger.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.084
How's the pie?

32:46.054 --> 32:47.557
I'll go check on that order.

32:49.857 --> 32:51.092
I make a good
wing girl, don't I?

32:52.124 --> 32:53.229
I don't know what you make.

32:53.261 --> 32:55.364
But I'm gonna go back and
talk to your grandmother

32:55.396 --> 32:56.531
as soon as we get home.

32:57.398 --> 32:58.600
Hey Murph!

32:58.634 --> 32:59.701
Come on, lemme
ask you something.

33:00.736 --> 33:01.971
How is everything, my friend?

33:02.003 --> 33:02.671
Everything's great.

33:02.704 --> 33:03.705
I think the best food in town.

33:03.739 --> 33:05.074
And best pies too.

33:05.941 --> 33:07.576
Let me ask you something.

33:07.608 --> 33:08.510
Yeah?

33:08.544 --> 33:10.579
So that waitress Jennifer.

33:10.612 --> 33:12.715
Is that the same Jennifer
from 15 years ago

33:12.748 --> 33:14.884
that had that
restaurant on Power?

33:14.916 --> 33:16.151
It is.

33:16.184 --> 33:17.619
She made her chops
from working here

33:17.653 --> 33:21.257
about 15 years
ago, 16 years ago.

33:21.289 --> 33:24.159
She went out on her own,
made a lot of money.

33:24.192 --> 33:27.529
Word is that her partner
was robbing her for years.

33:27.563 --> 33:29.798
Lost everything.

33:29.830 --> 33:31.199
Too bad.

33:31.232 --> 33:32.467
Great worker.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.568
She's a great gal.

33:34.536 --> 33:35.837
This is for you, sweety.

33:35.871 --> 33:37.239
Thank you.

33:37.271 --> 33:39.040
Oh that's nice.

33:39.074 --> 33:40.409
You two have a good one.

33:40.442 --> 33:44.413
And Joe, great seeing
you around here again.

33:44.445 --> 33:45.280
Thanks, buddy.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.182
This is too big.

33:47.215 --> 33:48.583
Here, have it, Two Sugars.

33:49.718 --> 33:50.920
It's a nice hat.

33:50.952 --> 33:51.854
All right.

33:51.886 --> 33:52.922
Just checked in on your orders.

33:52.954 --> 33:54.522
Be up in a couple minutes.

33:54.556 --> 33:57.393
Hey Joe, it's really
great seeing you again.

33:58.393 --> 33:59.295
It's been too long.

34:00.628 --> 34:02.264
I like seeing you as well.

34:03.898 --> 34:05.233
Be right back.

34:06.634 --> 34:07.636
Cool hat, huh?

34:08.769 --> 34:10.005
Hey I got one for you.

34:11.405 --> 34:14.710
How much does it cost a pirate
to get his ears pierced?

34:14.742 --> 34:15.545
How much?

34:16.411 --> 34:19.215
A buck an ear!

34:20.449 --> 34:22.050
Pretty funny.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.484
How's the pie?

34:23.518 --> 34:24.720
So good.

34:24.753 --> 34:26.222
Hey, wanna go
golfing next week?

34:26.255 --> 34:27.155
Yeah.

34:27.188 --> 34:28.523
All right, cool.

34:28.556 --> 34:29.357
Come on, eat up.

34:29.391 --> 34:30.259
Come on, let's go.

34:36.030 --> 34:36.865
All right.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.007
And this time, I'm
driving the cart.

34:45.039 --> 34:45.940
Oh darn.

34:45.974 --> 34:46.742
I'll still caddy for you.

34:46.775 --> 34:47.809
Hey, I had a great time.

34:47.842 --> 34:49.077
Thanks for bringing me with you.

34:49.110 --> 34:50.612
Of course.

34:50.646 --> 34:52.248
I can't believe they didn't
take your scooter from you.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.250
It's still here, huh?

34:54.282 --> 34:55.985
Yeah we do live
in a trailer park.

34:58.286 --> 35:00.489
Joe, I like you better
when you're not dead.

35:00.521 --> 35:01.690
You need more friends.

35:01.722 --> 35:03.858
I know Jennifer would
keep you company.

35:03.891 --> 35:05.627
Beside, you can't
always count on me.

35:05.661 --> 35:06.829
I'm a kid.

35:06.862 --> 35:08.297
I do have a life, you know.

35:08.329 --> 35:09.164
Bye.

35:10.197 --> 35:12.268
The kid's something else.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.134
Man.

35:26.014 --> 35:27.750
See that guy over there?

35:32.853 --> 35:35.123
That's the guy you gotta
put your sights on.

35:35.157 --> 35:36.458
He's the course pro.

35:36.490 --> 35:37.393
When you beat him,

35:37.425 --> 35:38.326
then you're gonna be ready

35:38.360 --> 35:41.030
for the Jani King Arizona Open.

35:41.063 --> 35:42.965
I've not played in that open.

35:42.998 --> 35:44.800
Look, Joe.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.434
The best way for you to get out

35:46.467 --> 35:49.003
from under this cloud
you've been living under

35:49.036 --> 35:50.371
is for you to play in that game

35:50.405 --> 35:53.175
and we both know
that, all right?

35:53.208 --> 35:55.644
Turning pro is your dream, Joe.

35:55.677 --> 35:58.247
And now you've got
another chance at it.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.115
And to heal.

35:59.981 --> 36:01.384
It's what your family wanted.

36:02.818 --> 36:05.688
And quite frankly, it's
the key to your salvation.

36:05.721 --> 36:08.257
You're one persuasive person.

36:08.289 --> 36:09.925
Yes I am.

36:09.958 --> 36:11.660
Now I want you to go over
there and tell that guy

36:11.693 --> 36:14.630
you want to play a round
or two with him, okay?

36:14.663 --> 36:15.831
Go do it.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.475
Excuse me.

36:27.509 --> 36:28.911
You Sean McLaw?

36:28.943 --> 36:29.778
Um, yeah.

36:30.679 --> 36:31.514
Course pro?

36:34.181 --> 36:35.350
Yup.

36:35.384 --> 36:37.385
What's a guy
like me have to do

36:37.418 --> 36:40.121
to get an opportunity to play
golf with a guy like you?

36:40.155 --> 36:40.990
Oh wow.

36:42.391 --> 36:44.059
I get little things
all the time.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.461
But I've seen you here before.

36:47.829 --> 36:49.431
You know what I'll do?

36:49.463 --> 36:51.333
I got a spot, seven
a.m. tomorrow.

36:53.300 --> 36:57.672
I will give you 13
strokes, 18 holes

36:57.706 --> 36:59.108
for 500 bucks.

36:59.141 --> 37:01.744
500 bucks cash, cash.

37:01.777 --> 37:03.813
Yeah, look, I live
in a trailer park.

37:04.612 --> 37:05.880
Yeah it's not my
problem you live

37:05.914 --> 37:06.982
in a trailer park, brother.

37:07.014 --> 37:07.849
No.

37:09.150 --> 37:12.353
If I lose, I'll
give you 10 grand.

37:12.387 --> 37:13.188
10 grand?

37:13.221 --> 37:14.456
10 grand.

37:14.489 --> 37:15.858
I'll get the 500 bucks.

37:15.891 --> 37:17.393
I'll give you 13 strokes.

37:17.425 --> 37:18.760
Okay, I'll get
the 500 dollars.

37:18.793 --> 37:20.328
We got a deal?

37:20.362 --> 37:21.296
Deal.

37:21.329 --> 37:22.131
Deal?

37:22.164 --> 37:23.332
Yeah, it's a deal.

37:23.364 --> 37:24.199
Deal.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.535
All right, sure.

37:26.568 --> 37:29.405
All right, thank
you, thank you.

37:30.505 --> 37:31.407
Nice swing.

37:41.349 --> 37:42.385
Hey, Joe.

37:43.284 --> 37:44.719
Sitting at your booth.

37:45.820 --> 37:46.822
How you doing?

37:46.855 --> 37:48.289
I'm doing great, thanks.

37:49.190 --> 37:50.291
Where's Sarah today?

37:51.159 --> 37:53.228
Sarah has a life, so she says.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.096
Oh, I can imagine.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.532
What I wouldn't give
to be that age again.

37:57.565 --> 37:59.167
You and me both.

37:59.201 --> 38:00.601
So what'll it be?

38:00.635 --> 38:01.437
Just coffee.

38:02.503 --> 38:03.704
Cream with two sugars.

38:03.737 --> 38:05.673
Are you sure you don't
want anything else?

38:05.706 --> 38:07.275
Nah.

38:07.309 --> 38:09.445
Okay, no problem.

38:09.478 --> 38:10.546
There she is.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.814
Hey you.

38:11.847 --> 38:13.115
Hi.

38:13.148 --> 38:14.650
How you doin'?

38:14.682 --> 38:16.150
Thank you so much
for swinging by.

38:16.184 --> 38:17.419
I have your book in the back.

38:17.452 --> 38:19.655
Oh, Margo, this is Joe.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.856
Joe, this is my very
best friend Margo.

38:22.990 --> 38:23.958
Nice to meet you.

38:24.659 --> 38:25.561
The pleasure's all mine.

38:25.594 --> 38:26.894
Okay, I'm gonna
go grab your book.

38:26.927 --> 38:27.862
I'll be right back.

38:29.063 --> 38:32.166
So, how did you meet Jennifer?

38:32.199 --> 38:34.635
We go back about 15 years.

38:34.668 --> 38:36.103
Really?

38:36.137 --> 38:38.006
Me and Jennifer grew up
together since we were six.

38:38.039 --> 38:39.975
She's an absolute doll.

38:40.007 --> 38:41.476
Oh, you can say that again.

38:42.409 --> 38:44.145
There you go, Mr. Two Sugars.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.514
How'd you like it?

38:46.547 --> 38:47.882
Oh, I loved it.

38:47.916 --> 38:49.918
I know you would.

38:49.951 --> 38:51.954
So what are you ladies
reading these days?

38:51.987 --> 38:54.490
Oh, it's a Dorothy
Lynn romance novel.

38:54.523 --> 38:55.557
You should read that.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.496
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

39:00.528 --> 39:01.730
All right, sweety.

39:01.762 --> 39:02.630
Thanks for coming in.

39:02.664 --> 39:04.099
Okay, I gotta say
goodbye to Murphy

39:04.132 --> 39:05.099
before I leave.

39:05.132 --> 39:06.734
You know I like that
big Italian guy.

39:06.768 --> 39:08.436
- Okay, I know you do.
- Bye.

39:08.469 --> 39:10.805
- Bye, sweety.
- Mhmm.

39:10.838 --> 39:12.740
So, how'd you like your coffee?

39:14.041 --> 39:15.177
Perfect.

39:15.210 --> 39:17.079
Your friend, she's kinda sweet.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.882
Oh, she is one in a million.

39:22.516 --> 39:24.986
Are you sure you don't
want anything else?

39:25.019 --> 39:26.121
Nah, coffee's fine.

39:26.153 --> 39:27.623
All right.

39:27.655 --> 39:32.494
Listen, I don't wanna sound
too forward or anything, but,

39:33.929 --> 39:37.566
would you maybe wanna go out
and grab dinner sometime?

39:37.599 --> 39:39.735
Are you asking me out?

39:39.768 --> 39:41.436
Just two old acquaintances

39:41.469 --> 39:43.105
getting to know
each other again?

39:45.239 --> 39:47.842
Sarah says I should get
out and meet more people.

39:49.077 --> 39:51.280
Well, Sarah is
a very smart girl.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.083
You know what, I'ma
take you up on your offer.

39:56.284 --> 39:57.853
Perfect.

39:57.885 --> 40:00.021
I am off all day tomorrow.

40:04.693 --> 40:05.961
Call me when you're done?

40:06.994 --> 40:07.829
I will.

40:10.864 --> 40:11.699
Thank you.

40:22.177 --> 40:23.912
You keep beating
me, you got honors.

40:23.945 --> 40:26.481
Yeah, I think it's
my honors right here.

40:26.514 --> 40:27.816
Yeah, I think so.

40:27.849 --> 40:29.184
You know what?

40:30.885 --> 40:32.388
This is about one,

40:36.090 --> 40:37.358
about 155, 160.

40:44.465 --> 40:46.701
Think it's an undulated green.

40:48.936 --> 40:50.940
You don't want to go
too close to the pin

40:52.440 --> 40:53.708
so you can fall back.

41:08.356 --> 41:09.191
Nice shot.

41:10.358 --> 41:11.727
Every single time.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.862
Can you give me a break?

41:38.152 --> 41:40.588
Ah, shit.

41:40.621 --> 41:41.456
Ah, shit.

41:44.025 --> 41:45.193
Good job.

41:45.226 --> 41:46.394
Yeah, I missed
the green again.

41:47.528 --> 41:48.929
Yeah, just relax into it.

41:48.963 --> 41:50.566
You're rushing
every single hole.

41:53.967 --> 41:55.536
Make sure you line it up.

41:56.804 --> 41:58.105
I can do this.

41:58.139 --> 41:59.173
I know you can.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.411
I don't think you
talking to your shoulder

42:02.443 --> 42:04.346
is gonna help you
much with that putt.

42:10.050 --> 42:11.519
You're not lining up.

42:11.552 --> 42:12.721
I am and I'm doing it.

42:12.753 --> 42:13.655
Okay, do it.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.297
Do you need a putter
or a three wood?

42:22.329 --> 42:25.701
I don't have it.

42:25.733 --> 42:26.802
Let's see here.

42:36.077 --> 42:37.312
In the hole!

42:37.344 --> 42:39.247
That's how it's done.

42:40.882 --> 42:43.684
18th hole,
you got honors again.

42:43.717 --> 42:44.552
Yeah we do.

42:46.086 --> 42:46.989
It's a tough hole.

42:49.190 --> 42:49.992
Tough hole.

42:53.293 --> 42:55.797
Actually I'm gonna
hit a iron here

42:56.731 --> 42:58.801
you know, to draw it back.

43:00.501 --> 43:03.038
But hit it soft.

43:03.070 --> 43:04.306
You're the
course pro, I don't know.

43:04.338 --> 43:06.974
Five wood to draw it in.

43:22.923 --> 43:24.525
Great shot.

43:24.559 --> 43:25.661
It just went straight.

43:28.163 --> 43:30.032
Well you can putt
like nobody else.

43:39.673 --> 43:42.043
Need help
with that, old man?

43:42.076 --> 43:43.344
- No.
- No?

43:43.378 --> 43:44.278
I got it.

43:44.311 --> 43:45.346
You got it, okay.

44:13.307 --> 44:14.143
Ah!

44:22.449 --> 44:26.288
You know, quick like, I
just wanna line it up.

44:28.922 --> 44:30.091
Here it comes.

44:43.137 --> 44:44.072
- Oh.
- Ah.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.110
Want me to tap it
in or you wanna go?

44:49.143 --> 44:49.978
Go ahead.

44:50.945 --> 44:51.780
Finish it up.

44:53.914 --> 44:55.050
Can't even finish it up.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.351
Three putt.

44:56.384 --> 44:57.184
Four putt.

44:57.217 --> 44:58.420
Four putt.

44:58.452 --> 45:00.454
That's
the way the day's been

45:00.487 --> 45:02.022
all day today.

45:02.056 --> 45:02.891
Okay.

45:23.244 --> 45:24.079
Nice game.

45:26.981 --> 45:27.782
- All right.
- You're good.

45:27.815 --> 45:29.050
I owe you some money.

45:29.083 --> 45:29.918
You're good.

45:29.951 --> 45:31.452
I have it in the
car, thank you.

45:32.619 --> 45:35.522
You think I got a
shot at a comeback?

45:35.556 --> 45:37.858
Actually, I
really think you do.

45:37.891 --> 45:38.726
Okay.

45:40.027 --> 45:40.862
Thank you.

45:42.195 --> 45:43.798
Get the fuck out of here.

45:44.932 --> 45:46.434
Hi, Jen.

45:46.467 --> 45:49.436
Well, how did
your round with Shane go?

45:49.469 --> 45:51.439
Exactly how I planned it.

45:52.306 --> 45:53.140
I let him win.

45:54.474 --> 45:56.210
I'm sure you did.

45:56.244 --> 45:58.246
Hey, I wanna ask you.

45:58.278 --> 45:59.748
Have you ever tried yoga?

46:31.813 --> 46:32.748
Hey, go on.

46:33.648 --> 46:35.115
I'm so glad you're up for this.

46:35.148 --> 46:36.851
It's a good way for us to
get reacquainted, right?

46:36.884 --> 46:38.052
Yeah, I don't know about this.

46:38.085 --> 46:38.852
You're fine, you're fine.

46:38.885 --> 46:39.688
Get on your mat there.

46:39.721 --> 46:40.688
I don't think it's my thing.

46:40.722 --> 46:42.157
Just do what I
do, you're fine.

46:42.190 --> 46:43.557
Okay.

46:43.590 --> 46:45.192
It could be
really good for your golf game.

46:45.226 --> 46:46.295
So you say.

46:50.764 --> 46:52.266
This is really painful.

46:52.300 --> 46:54.169
Okay, let's switch it up.

46:54.202 --> 46:55.971
Sit on your tush,
come on, let's go.

46:56.003 --> 46:57.771
There you go.

46:57.804 --> 46:58.605
- You good?
- Yeah.

46:58.639 --> 47:00.442
You all right, okay.

47:00.474 --> 47:01.409
That's fine.

47:02.510 --> 47:04.679
So tell me about
your game with Shane.

47:04.711 --> 47:06.681
It's what I was expecting.

47:06.713 --> 47:07.815
He really loves himself.

47:07.849 --> 47:08.750
Ugh.

47:08.782 --> 47:10.018
I could say that for sure.

47:10.050 --> 47:12.487
Yeah, he is not one
of my favorite people.

47:13.855 --> 47:14.690
I can see why.

47:16.157 --> 47:19.094
Hello class, and
welcome new student.

47:23.398 --> 47:24.766
Let's get started.

47:24.798 --> 47:26.067
This is a class?

47:27.235 --> 47:29.003
Not the kind of date
you were expecting, huh?

47:29.036 --> 47:29.837
Date?

47:29.871 --> 47:30.972
I had no idea.

47:32.106 --> 47:33.408
Are you sure about that?

47:34.675 --> 47:37.446
Let's get started.

47:42.849 --> 47:44.219
Oh my god.

47:44.251 --> 47:46.121
I hope my insurance is paid up.

47:50.724 --> 47:51.692
What?

47:51.726 --> 47:53.061
- Look at her, not me.
- Oh.

47:53.094 --> 47:53.894
I gotta watch her?

47:53.927 --> 47:54.762
Shh.

47:58.599 --> 48:01.202
This is for the birds.

48:08.409 --> 48:09.611
Some workout.

48:09.643 --> 48:10.911
You do this all the time?

48:10.945 --> 48:12.213
When I can afford it.

48:13.081 --> 48:14.082
Oh my god.

48:16.384 --> 48:18.019
Thank you so much for
coming to class today.

48:18.052 --> 48:19.554
It was so nice having you.

48:19.586 --> 48:21.389
Hope you liked our class

48:21.422 --> 48:24.925
and hope to see you back
at our next session.

48:24.958 --> 48:26.427
Yeah, maybe, but,

48:26.460 --> 48:29.263
I'm not wearing ballet pants
like that guy over there.

48:30.498 --> 48:32.934
Although he'd make a good caddy.

48:34.202 --> 48:37.806
Well, students come
in all shapes and sizes.

48:41.074 --> 48:43.210
Jennifer, I almost forgot.

48:43.244 --> 48:45.579
Thought I'd give you your
invoice for last month

48:45.612 --> 48:46.947
and this month.

48:46.981 --> 48:48.083
Other than mailing it.

48:48.949 --> 48:50.518
Oh, wow.

48:51.351 --> 48:52.786
Thank you.

48:52.820 --> 48:55.457
I must have overlooked it.

48:55.489 --> 48:58.892
I will have that check to you

48:58.925 --> 49:00.795
as soon as possible.

49:00.827 --> 49:02.163
- Of course.
- Yeah, okay.

49:03.331 --> 49:06.034
Until I see you
both again, namaste.

49:07.135 --> 49:08.336
Namasake to you too.

49:10.438 --> 49:11.273
Namaste.

49:16.177 --> 49:17.612
So.

49:17.644 --> 49:19.980
Do you wanna go
grab a bite to eat?

49:21.047 --> 49:22.250
Boy, that sounds good.

49:25.286 --> 49:28.188
I better soak my body
in ice for a few weeks.

49:28.222 --> 49:29.057
Okay.

49:30.657 --> 49:32.092
All right.

49:32.126 --> 49:36.164
No, seriously, I got a
early tee time tomorrow and

49:36.197 --> 49:37.999
I need to run a few errands.

49:38.032 --> 49:40.802
Oh, all right.

49:40.835 --> 49:42.503
Well, can I call you later,

49:42.536 --> 49:44.404
make sure you
haven't frozen stiff

49:44.438 --> 49:45.706
from your ice bath?

49:46.574 --> 49:47.742
Yeah, sure.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.545
I can't move right now.

49:51.579 --> 49:53.481
I'ma cool down a little bit.

49:53.514 --> 49:54.349
Okay.

49:58.552 --> 50:00.721
All right, Mr. Two Sugars.

50:00.755 --> 50:01.890
I'll talk to you later.

50:06.360 --> 50:08.797
I hope so.

50:10.197 --> 50:12.701
Jeez, I'm never coming back
to this fricking place.

50:38.159 --> 50:40.595
I must be kidding myself.

50:40.628 --> 50:41.796
Without my family,

50:44.498 --> 50:45.367
it's not worth it.

50:47.134 --> 50:48.635
It's time
to stop feeling sorry

50:48.668 --> 50:49.903
for yourself, Joe.

50:49.936 --> 50:51.306
You're not the one
that died that day.

50:53.574 --> 50:54.376
Graham?

50:57.344 --> 50:58.779
I must be losing my mind.

51:07.722 --> 51:10.057
Rise and shine, let's go.

51:14.161 --> 51:15.764
I know you're in there, come on.

51:17.465 --> 51:18.399
Hey.

51:18.431 --> 51:19.634
What the hell is your problem?

51:19.666 --> 51:20.835
I feel like I've been out here

51:20.867 --> 51:21.835
banging on your door for years.

51:21.869 --> 51:23.504
Now get dressed.

51:23.536 --> 51:25.305
We got a few things
to work on today.

51:25.338 --> 51:27.641
I'm not sure
what this is about.

51:27.675 --> 51:29.644
I have to admit, you're
very persuasive, but,

51:29.677 --> 51:30.644
Listen.

51:30.677 --> 51:32.012
You hit the course today,

51:32.045 --> 51:34.581
if you still feel the
same way by tomorrow,

51:34.614 --> 51:35.883
I'll leave you be, hmm?

51:38.318 --> 51:42.356
I'll be right out.

51:42.389 --> 51:43.557
Good.

51:43.590 --> 51:45.592
Make sure you wear
your best golf clothes.

51:45.626 --> 51:46.494
If they still fit.

51:56.202 --> 51:58.773
Just consider this
a dress rehearsal.

52:00.641 --> 52:01.576
We'll see.

52:01.608 --> 52:02.476
Okay.

52:04.844 --> 52:06.280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:06.313 --> 52:08.048
No, you don't have all
your weight on your heels.

52:08.081 --> 52:09.616
Give me a minute, will you?

52:09.650 --> 52:10.751
Okay.

52:10.784 --> 52:12.052
Jeez.

52:12.085 --> 52:13.320
You know, you've
come a long way

52:13.353 --> 52:15.088
in a short period of time, Joe.

52:15.121 --> 52:16.723
And that is just
a true testament

52:16.757 --> 52:18.726
to how good you once were.

52:18.759 --> 52:20.927
But the question you gotta
ask yourself right now is

52:20.960 --> 52:22.529
do I really want this?

52:22.563 --> 52:24.999
And I already know
what the answer is.

52:25.032 --> 52:26.601
You lose your family,

52:26.634 --> 52:29.070
I'd like to see you get
your head into this game.

52:29.103 --> 52:30.838
I know what's in
your heart, Joe.

52:30.871 --> 52:32.673
We all believed in you.

52:32.706 --> 52:33.875
We?

52:33.907 --> 52:36.243
I still don't know
who the hell you are.

52:36.277 --> 52:37.479
Can we get back to it?

52:38.978 --> 52:40.114
I'm a little sore.

52:40.146 --> 52:41.615
This girl I know
took me to play yoga,

52:41.648 --> 52:43.317
work out yoga or whatever,

52:43.351 --> 52:45.619
I've never sweat
so much in my life.

52:45.652 --> 52:47.020
Yoga, that's a little new age

52:47.054 --> 52:48.489
but I guess that'll help.

52:48.521 --> 52:49.356
All right.

52:54.094 --> 52:56.496
That was brilliant!

52:56.530 --> 52:57.732
That was brilliant.

52:57.764 --> 52:58.699
You're a little
stiff, little stiff

52:58.733 --> 53:00.702
but that's not bad at all.

53:00.735 --> 53:01.869
A lot of stiff.

53:01.902 --> 53:04.005
That was good.

54:43.704 --> 54:46.106
Oh my god, beautiful!

55:37.657 --> 55:38.925
Girl, you know me.

55:38.958 --> 55:40.961
I used to be just like you.

55:40.994 --> 55:44.065
Constantly looking for
the right relationship.

55:44.097 --> 55:47.168
But it seems like all the
good men are already taken.

55:47.201 --> 55:49.936
And I've given up on
that a long time ago.

55:49.969 --> 55:51.338
I'm a free spirit.

55:51.371 --> 55:53.440
And I love a variety of men.

55:54.942 --> 55:56.943
Even age-appropriate
from time to time

55:56.976 --> 55:58.478
but that's mostly boring.

55:58.512 --> 56:01.149
Margo, you worry me sometimes.

56:03.684 --> 56:05.653
So, what about you?

56:05.686 --> 56:07.989
You should go out and date more.

56:08.021 --> 56:11.259
I'm telling you,
it's invigorating.

56:11.291 --> 56:14.528
Well I'm interested
in someone.

56:14.561 --> 56:17.531
Hmm, let me
guess, Mr. Joe Bona?

56:18.532 --> 56:20.635
Well, yeah.

56:21.869 --> 56:23.671
You don't want
that kind of baggage.

56:23.704 --> 56:24.806
What do you mean?

56:26.472 --> 56:27.775
He told me himself.

56:29.677 --> 56:31.211
I thought he was divorced.

56:31.244 --> 56:33.013
Murphy told me
that he lost his wife

56:33.047 --> 56:35.382
and his two kids
in a car accident.

56:37.217 --> 56:38.286
Oh my god.

56:40.253 --> 56:42.556
He just came to a yoga
class with me the other day.

56:42.590 --> 56:43.758
He didn't say anything.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.159
You brought him here?

56:45.192 --> 56:45.960
Yeah.

56:45.992 --> 56:47.261
Are you serious?

56:52.699 --> 56:53.900
Jennifer.

56:53.934 --> 56:55.769
I received your
check in the mail.

56:55.802 --> 56:57.704
Thank you so much,
you're paid in full.

56:57.737 --> 56:59.606
Oh, okay, great, sure.

57:02.509 --> 57:03.478
That's strange.

57:14.387 --> 57:16.156
Yeah
it's to the pin.

57:17.023 --> 57:18.226
It's currently 300 degrees.

57:20.527 --> 57:22.230
This is a very tricky shot.

57:23.963 --> 57:26.199
Hey Joe, did you golf today?

57:26.233 --> 57:27.735
Starting with all
the questions again?

57:27.768 --> 57:29.036
Was it a good game?

57:30.237 --> 57:31.639
Nah, I couldn't
get my groove on.

57:36.043 --> 57:36.878
I got an idea.

57:37.945 --> 57:39.680
What's your favorite
thing to do?

57:39.713 --> 57:41.882
Well, I like dinosaurs.

57:41.914 --> 57:43.317
You can go.

57:43.349 --> 57:45.085
And this time you
buy her dinner.

57:46.253 --> 57:48.122
Your grandmother's
something else.

57:48.155 --> 57:49.657
Let me get my keys.

57:49.690 --> 57:51.826
I always wanted a
brontosaurus burger.

58:14.213 --> 58:15.215
You okay?

58:15.248 --> 58:16.916
Yeah I'm fine.

58:16.949 --> 58:19.552
Do you know why that
dinosaur's holding that egg?

58:19.585 --> 58:20.721
Oh, you're
not gonna start

58:20.753 --> 58:21.889
with all the questions
again, are you?

58:21.922 --> 58:23.657
No, I was quizzing you.

58:23.690 --> 58:25.725
That's an Oviraptor.

58:25.759 --> 58:26.793
How'd you know that?

58:26.827 --> 58:28.930
I'm gonna check that out.

58:32.365 --> 58:34.568
Right, it is an Oviraptor.

58:34.601 --> 58:36.303
Good job, kid.

58:36.335 --> 58:37.538
Let's go check out some more

58:37.570 --> 58:38.773
- over there.
- Yeah.

58:38.806 --> 58:40.474
This is pretty
cool, this place.

58:40.507 --> 58:42.009
Wow, look at all
the different kinds.

58:42.041 --> 58:43.277
So cool.

58:43.309 --> 58:44.512
Yeah.

58:44.545 --> 58:45.980
Imagine if we were
alive back then,

58:46.012 --> 58:47.715
they'd probably
eat me for dinner.

58:49.717 --> 58:51.519
Wow, look at that one.

58:51.552 --> 58:52.387
That's crazy.

58:53.320 --> 58:54.455
Oh, little baby.

58:54.487 --> 58:58.259
Hi baby, how you doin',
baby?

58:58.291 --> 58:59.126
Cool, man.

59:01.128 --> 59:02.296
Oh wow.

59:02.329 --> 59:03.164
Wow.

59:04.431 --> 59:06.067
Pretty colors here too.

59:06.099 --> 59:07.969
- So cool.
- The size of that thing.

59:10.237 --> 59:11.239
Skeletons.

59:12.572 --> 59:13.673
It's the skeleton.

59:13.706 --> 59:14.507
Yeah.

59:14.541 --> 59:16.777
Look at that huh, wow.

59:16.809 --> 59:17.644
Cool, man.

59:19.646 --> 59:21.015
Wow.

59:21.047 --> 59:22.248
This place is phenomenal.

59:22.282 --> 59:24.285
I'm glad you took me here.

59:24.318 --> 59:25.353
Well I took you here.

59:28.789 --> 59:30.324
Oh, I'm gonna quiz you now.

59:30.356 --> 59:31.192
Okay.

59:32.326 --> 59:33.827
What's the guy
with the long neck?

59:33.860 --> 59:35.929
That's a Diplodocus.

59:35.963 --> 59:37.531
But why does he
have such a long neck?

59:37.563 --> 59:38.998
Eats plants and
so it can reach it

59:39.032 --> 59:39.867
from the very top.

59:40.934 --> 59:42.136
Yeah, let's go look.

59:44.637 --> 59:45.505
What'd you call him again?

59:45.539 --> 59:46.374
Diplodocus.

59:51.478 --> 59:52.613
Oh yeah, look at that,

59:52.646 --> 59:54.481
it does eat the
leaves off the trees.

59:55.681 --> 59:58.418
Eats trees, branches,
look at all the green.

59:58.452 --> 59:59.587
Wow, you really do
know your dinosaurs.

59:59.619 --> 1:00:01.255
- Yeah.
- Let's go look at some more.

1:00:01.288 --> 1:00:02.222
Cool.

1:00:02.255 --> 1:00:03.423
I like this place.

1:00:03.456 --> 1:00:04.257
Yeah.

1:00:04.291 --> 1:00:04.925
This is fun.

1:00:04.958 --> 1:00:05.925
Oh, look at the little baby!

1:00:05.958 --> 1:00:06.793
Oh, wow.

1:00:08.228 --> 1:00:09.063
Wow.

1:00:10.496 --> 1:00:11.498
Look at that.

1:00:21.675 --> 1:00:23.878
You were great
with those dinosaurs.

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:25.546
I love dinosaurs.

1:00:25.579 --> 1:00:26.847
My father did too.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:27.914
So did my daughter.

1:00:28.981 --> 1:00:30.416
Look.

1:00:30.449 --> 1:00:31.718
I gotta use the restroom.

1:00:32.686 --> 1:00:35.189
Promise me you won't disappear.

1:00:36.056 --> 1:00:36.891
Pinky promise.

1:00:39.159 --> 1:00:40.494
Okay, I'll be right back.

1:01:23.336 --> 1:01:25.105
Okay, that went better.

1:01:26.106 --> 1:01:27.708
We gotta get going.

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:28.909
It's been a long day today

1:01:28.942 --> 1:01:30.677
but tomorrow's gonna
be even longer.

1:01:30.710 --> 1:01:32.178
Can I get another
order of fries?

1:01:32.211 --> 1:01:33.646
You're still hungry?

1:01:33.679 --> 1:01:34.948
I'm growing like
a weed these days.

1:01:34.981 --> 1:01:36.217
Forget about it!

1:01:36.250 --> 1:01:39.686
Okay but
we gotta make it fast.

1:01:39.719 --> 1:01:40.954
Sure.

1:01:42.755 --> 1:01:44.757
So, how's your golf game going?

1:01:44.791 --> 1:01:46.293
Ah, pff.

1:01:46.326 --> 1:01:49.329
It gets them this way, I
go some slice, some hook,

1:01:49.362 --> 1:01:51.164
some go and don't come back.

1:01:51.197 --> 1:01:53.033
Sometimes I miss
the ball completely.

1:01:54.635 --> 1:01:56.003
I'm working on it, it's coming.

1:01:56.036 --> 1:01:57.204
You're doing great though.

1:01:57.237 --> 1:02:00.007
Have you ever
toasted a French fry?

1:02:00.039 --> 1:02:00.807
No.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:01.842
Pick up a fry.

1:02:01.875 --> 1:02:03.744
Hold it straight up, right?

1:02:03.777 --> 1:02:06.146
And like glasses when
they ching glasses,

1:02:06.179 --> 1:02:07.081
we're gonna ching French fries,

1:02:07.114 --> 1:02:07.914
- ready?
- Okay.

1:02:07.947 --> 1:02:08.748
Ching.

1:02:10.016 --> 1:02:11.219
You broke my fry.

1:02:22.161 --> 1:02:23.830
What's with the smiles?

1:02:23.864 --> 1:02:24.699
Nothing.

1:02:29.702 --> 1:02:30.737
What are you up to?

1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:33.773
Okay.

1:02:36.376 --> 1:02:38.246
Hopefully you had
a good lunch today.

1:02:42.682 --> 1:02:44.251
Well, well, well.

1:02:45.918 --> 1:02:47.186
Look who it is.

1:02:47.219 --> 1:02:48.054
Uh huh.

1:02:48.989 --> 1:02:51.224
Let's go up and check it out.

1:02:51.257 --> 1:02:52.726
Let's see why she's here, huh?

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:00.401
Yeah, uh huh.

1:03:01.367 --> 1:03:02.202
You.

1:03:03.804 --> 1:03:04.905
What's with the smile?

1:03:06.306 --> 1:03:10.077
Well we're
gonna find out right now.

1:03:12.411 --> 1:03:14.314
Yeah, I know you.

1:03:14.347 --> 1:03:15.181
You're beaming.

1:03:19.186 --> 1:03:21.488
What a coincidence.

1:03:21.521 --> 1:03:23.891
Looky what we have here, hi.

1:03:25.726 --> 1:03:26.559
Hi, guys.

1:03:26.592 --> 1:03:28.027
- Hi, Joe.
- How you doing?

1:03:28.061 --> 1:03:29.430
I'm good.

1:03:29.463 --> 1:03:32.266
Okay, what's going on
here, is this a setup?

1:03:36.603 --> 1:03:38.238
We were just leaving.

1:03:38.271 --> 1:03:39.473
What brings you down here?

1:03:39.505 --> 1:03:41.040
Oh, I was just,

1:03:41.074 --> 1:03:43.844
I swung by to bring up
some passes for my nephews.

1:03:43.876 --> 1:03:45.079
I'm so glad to see you.

1:03:45.112 --> 1:03:46.512
I'm happy to see you too.

1:03:46.545 --> 1:03:48.214
I'm happy to see both of you.

1:03:50.250 --> 1:03:52.485
Listen, I'd love to
see you again sometime.

1:03:52.518 --> 1:03:54.354
Maybe dinner?

1:03:55.422 --> 1:03:57.590
Sure, that would be great.

1:03:57.623 --> 1:03:58.458
Yeah.

1:03:59.925 --> 1:04:02.028
Feel like a busy
week but I'd love to.

1:04:02.061 --> 1:04:03.429
He's gonna beat the golf pro.

1:04:03.463 --> 1:04:04.731
Ooh.

1:04:04.764 --> 1:04:07.233
Well, yeah I gotta
beat the pro, but

1:04:07.266 --> 1:04:08.634
we'll see how it goes.

1:04:08.668 --> 1:04:10.604
That's wonderful, Joe.

1:04:10.637 --> 1:04:12.306
I know you can beat him.

1:04:12.338 --> 1:04:14.041
Well I know you think so.

1:04:14.074 --> 1:04:15.842
But I'm not so sure.

1:04:15.876 --> 1:04:17.144
I know he will too.

1:04:19.378 --> 1:04:21.581
You, young lady
and I, we gotta go.

1:04:21.614 --> 1:04:23.116
Okay.

1:04:23.150 --> 1:04:24.284
Well, bye.

1:04:24.317 --> 1:04:25.152
Bye.

1:04:26.385 --> 1:04:27.320
Bye, Joe.

1:04:28.387 --> 1:04:30.723
I know you could do it.

1:04:30.757 --> 1:04:33.327
And by the way, I
don't have nephews.

1:04:35.728 --> 1:04:40.400
Come
on, kiddo, let's go.

1:04:51.811 --> 1:04:54.347
Sarah, come here, quick.

1:04:54.380 --> 1:04:55.281
What is it?

1:04:55.315 --> 1:04:56.483
Well, look at Mr. Bona.

1:04:56.516 --> 1:04:58.952
I mean, do you think
he's all right?

1:04:58.985 --> 1:04:59.787
What do you mean?

1:04:59.820 --> 1:05:01.422
Well, look, Sarah.

1:05:01.454 --> 1:05:04.357
He's arguing and
yelling at someone.

1:05:04.391 --> 1:05:05.358
I think.

1:05:06.525 --> 1:05:09.230
I mean, I can't see
any other person.

1:05:10.463 --> 1:05:11.264
Can you?

1:05:11.297 --> 1:05:12.132
No.

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.234
Where were you?

1:05:14.266 --> 1:05:15.701
You bailed on me!

1:05:15.735 --> 1:05:17.003
I saw everything, Joe.

1:05:19.206 --> 1:05:20.441
How could you?

1:05:20.474 --> 1:05:22.576
I've been watching
from a distance, Joe.

1:05:23.577 --> 1:05:25.345
I'm always watching.

1:05:25.378 --> 1:05:27.681
Again, speaking in a
language I don't get,

1:05:27.713 --> 1:05:29.148
I don't understand.

1:05:29.181 --> 1:05:32.351
You're so
close, Joe, so close.

1:05:32.385 --> 1:05:33.454
From what?!

1:05:34.387 --> 1:05:35.456
Your resurrection.

1:05:35.489 --> 1:05:36.923
I'm not the dead one.

1:05:36.956 --> 1:05:38.025
My wife and kids are.

1:05:38.057 --> 1:05:39.259
They're gone!

1:05:39.291 --> 1:05:41.060
And why are you
doing this to me?

1:05:41.094 --> 1:05:43.063
I'm not gonna
give up on you, Joe.

1:05:43.096 --> 1:05:44.431
Never.

1:05:44.463 --> 1:05:48.168
Instead of running away
from what once was, Joe,

1:05:48.201 --> 1:05:50.804
cherish it, draw
strength from it.

1:05:51.938 --> 1:05:55.943
And from that, you
will be strong again.

1:05:55.976 --> 1:05:58.878
Come tomorrow, you're gonna
see a brand new Joe Bona.

1:06:21.534 --> 1:06:24.337
Keep your eye on
this one, all right?

1:06:24.371 --> 1:06:25.939
I'ma launch this.

1:06:25.972 --> 1:06:27.074
Go right ahead.

1:06:27.106 --> 1:06:29.041
I'ma launch it.

1:06:29.074 --> 1:06:30.143
Okay, go right ahead.

1:06:30.177 --> 1:06:31.178
All right.

1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:39.418
And have a nice
little pigeon wedge

1:06:39.452 --> 1:06:40.754
into the green.

1:06:58.972 --> 1:06:59.840
Nice launch.

1:07:02.809 --> 1:07:03.744
You know, my friend?

1:07:03.777 --> 1:07:04.945
Yeah?

1:07:04.978 --> 1:07:06.914
It's time to show you
who the real Joe is.

1:07:06.947 --> 1:07:07.748
Okay.

1:07:09.682 --> 1:07:11.083
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:11.117 --> 1:07:12.085
Not kidding.

1:07:12.117 --> 1:07:13.019
I'm back, baby.

1:07:17.523 --> 1:07:20.260
You know, mine
went about 330, by the way.

1:07:23.963 --> 1:07:25.666
There's no way I
can hit 350 or 400

1:07:25.699 --> 1:07:26.599
but I'm gonna try.

1:07:41.146 --> 1:07:41.981
Nice shot.

1:07:42.882 --> 1:07:45.152
Oh, I got a hold of that one.

1:07:45.184 --> 1:07:46.085
Broke my tee.

1:07:49.289 --> 1:07:50.891
I think I outdrove you, sir.

1:07:50.923 --> 1:07:52.826
I have to admit,
it was a good shot.

1:07:54.927 --> 1:07:56.230
Look at that.

1:07:56.262 --> 1:07:58.531
You outdrove me there.

1:07:58.565 --> 1:07:59.766
Yeah, I certainly did.

1:07:59.798 --> 1:08:01.335
Not much but I outdrove you.

1:08:01.367 --> 1:08:02.268
Yeah you did.

1:08:02.302 --> 1:08:03.604
I don't know what else to say.

1:08:03.637 --> 1:08:05.272
- I guess you're up.
- Not bad.

1:08:12.679 --> 1:08:13.981
A little bit of dirt, huh?

1:08:15.547 --> 1:08:16.416
I'm feeling good.

1:08:17.783 --> 1:08:18.985
I'm gonna put it
right over the 150

1:08:19.019 --> 1:08:20.153
and shoot right
towards the hole.

1:08:20.185 --> 1:08:21.121
Here we go, watch this.

1:08:21.154 --> 1:08:22.690
Okay, I'm watching.

1:08:23.856 --> 1:08:25.859
It's what I used to
do when I was a kid.

1:08:28.228 --> 1:08:29.895
Look at that puppy.

1:08:29.929 --> 1:08:30.931
Sailed right to the green.

1:08:30.963 --> 1:08:32.365
Holy cow, I'm back.

1:08:33.667 --> 1:08:34.835
Joe Bona is back!

1:08:35.769 --> 1:08:37.170
Nice shot.

1:08:37.203 --> 1:08:38.372
Thank you sir, let's get this.

1:08:38.404 --> 1:08:39.472
Nice shot.

1:08:39.506 --> 1:08:40.407
Thank you.

1:08:40.439 --> 1:08:41.641
Thank you very much, pro.

1:08:41.675 --> 1:08:43.543
I don't say it that
much, but nice shot.

1:08:43.576 --> 1:08:45.613
Nice drive.

1:08:46.845 --> 1:08:48.114
I guess I'm,

1:08:48.148 --> 1:08:49.048
You got ups,

1:08:49.082 --> 1:08:50.684
I outdrove you again, I'm happy.

1:08:50.716 --> 1:08:51.818
You did outdrive me.

1:08:56.355 --> 1:08:58.791
It's not all about the drive.

1:09:05.931 --> 1:09:06.766
Nice.

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:09.268
A little too much
dirt, but not bad.

1:09:09.301 --> 1:09:10.636
A little too much.

1:09:10.670 --> 1:09:13.206
I'm having a good day today.

1:09:13.238 --> 1:09:15.107
Playing like I did
when I was a kid.

1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:17.911
I'm gonna go over to 150 and
tail it towards the green.

1:09:17.944 --> 1:09:18.779
Watch this.

1:09:19.645 --> 1:09:20.480
I'm watching.

1:09:26.152 --> 1:09:26.987
Nice shot.

1:09:28.188 --> 1:09:29.456
Ooh hoo.

1:09:29.488 --> 1:09:31.924
Yeah, Joe Bona is back.

1:09:33.025 --> 1:09:33.860
How you doin'?

1:09:35.095 --> 1:09:36.030
Where's my cigar?

1:09:37.896 --> 1:09:40.567
Actually, you
deserve one after that shot.

1:09:53.479 --> 1:09:54.280
Oh well.

1:09:55.547 --> 1:09:56.649
Must be your shoulder.

1:09:57.716 --> 1:09:58.551
Yep.

1:09:59.953 --> 1:10:00.954
All right.

1:10:09.261 --> 1:10:10.197
Nice shot.

1:10:11.765 --> 1:10:12.566
Good job.

1:10:12.599 --> 1:10:14.101
Wow.

1:10:14.134 --> 1:10:14.935
Big shot.

1:10:14.967 --> 1:10:16.635
I got a hold of that.

1:10:16.668 --> 1:10:17.470
Big shot.

1:10:17.503 --> 1:10:18.338
Way to go, Joe.

1:10:20.273 --> 1:10:21.775
All right, we get in the cart?

1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:28.114
Ah, what a bummer.

1:10:29.916 --> 1:10:31.118
You just go ahead
and tap that in.

1:10:32.585 --> 1:10:33.420
Or a gimme.

1:10:39.559 --> 1:10:40.360
Crazy.

1:10:40.393 --> 1:10:41.228
Go ahead.

1:10:43.529 --> 1:10:45.532
Even if I miss
it, it's gonna go in.

1:10:51.237 --> 1:10:52.306
Are you kidding me?

1:10:56.376 --> 1:10:57.177
Good job.

1:10:57.210 --> 1:10:58.011
I did it!

1:11:00.113 --> 1:11:01.847
You know what?

1:11:01.881 --> 1:11:02.716
You are ready.

1:11:04.617 --> 1:11:06.820
Through all the crap
I put you through,

1:11:06.853 --> 1:11:07.855
you are ready.

1:11:09.122 --> 1:11:10.323
Cool.

1:11:10.355 --> 1:11:12.259
Well Joe,
how did that feel?

1:11:12.292 --> 1:11:13.627
Amazing.

1:11:13.659 --> 1:11:14.461
See?

1:11:14.493 --> 1:11:15.694
This is not a dream.

1:11:15.728 --> 1:11:16.930
That was all real.

1:11:16.962 --> 1:11:18.664
And you really
are a great golfer

1:11:18.698 --> 1:11:21.568
like I'd been preaching to you
over the last several weeks.

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.304
And now it's time to go
play in the prequalifier

1:11:24.337 --> 1:11:25.338
so you can get a number

1:11:25.371 --> 1:11:26.873
and play in the tournament.

1:11:26.905 --> 1:11:28.942
The Arizona Open, my friend.

1:11:30.076 --> 1:11:31.711
You know, I still
don't know who you are,

1:11:31.743 --> 1:11:33.179
I don't know where
you came from,

1:11:33.212 --> 1:11:35.581
but I appreciate what
you've been doing for me.

1:11:35.614 --> 1:11:38.452
And tomorrow, I'm gonna
win that qualifier.

1:11:39.351 --> 1:11:41.387
That's what I wanna hear, Joe.

1:11:41.421 --> 1:11:43.190
There's one thing I want
you to really think about

1:11:43.222 --> 1:11:45.091
when you're out
there tomorrow, okay?

1:11:45.123 --> 1:11:47.359
That yes, you're doing
this for your family

1:11:47.393 --> 1:11:50.329
but it was part of
their dream as well.

1:11:50.363 --> 1:11:53.567
And now it's time
to do it for you.

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:54.568
Do it for Joe.

1:11:55.801 --> 1:11:56.635
All right?

1:11:56.668 --> 1:11:57.871
Mhmm.

1:11:57.904 --> 1:11:59.172
Good
luck out there, Joe.

1:11:59.204 --> 1:12:00.006
Thank you.

1:12:21.159 --> 1:12:22.394
Like I outdrove you
again there, rookie.

1:12:22.427 --> 1:12:25.064
What the hell
you talking about?

1:12:30.103 --> 1:12:31.805
Come on Joe, you
can outdrive him.

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:43.549
I nailed that baby.

1:12:43.582 --> 1:12:46.085
Your turn.

1:12:49.822 --> 1:12:51.492
Let's see you do
outdo that, pal.

1:12:53.826 --> 1:12:55.095
See, I told you.

1:13:00.533 --> 1:13:02.435
See, I told you.

1:13:02.467 --> 1:13:05.639
Okay, get
the clubs, let's go.

1:13:23.523 --> 1:13:24.757
Yeah, beat that, bubba.

1:13:25.658 --> 1:13:30.664
Nice hit, Joe.

1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:42.175
Nice.

1:13:42.207 --> 1:13:43.542
Good hit.

1:13:43.576 --> 1:13:44.543
I don't know, here you go.

1:13:44.577 --> 1:13:45.478
Let's get outta here.

1:13:45.511 --> 1:13:46.513
I did it.

1:13:46.546 --> 1:13:48.582
I really, really did it, yeah.

1:13:48.614 --> 1:13:50.516
I did it, I frickin
actually won.

1:13:51.551 --> 1:13:53.386
Hey Joe, congratulations.

1:13:53.418 --> 1:13:55.087
Great round.

1:13:55.121 --> 1:13:56.690
You've qualified
for the tournament,

1:13:56.722 --> 1:13:58.291
first time in 15 years.

1:13:58.323 --> 1:13:59.259
Thank you.

1:13:59.292 --> 1:14:01.428
I hope you win the tournament.

1:14:03.229 --> 1:14:04.030
Sign here?

1:14:04.063 --> 1:14:04.898
Good luck to you.

1:14:05.765 --> 1:14:06.865
Sign there.

1:14:06.899 --> 1:14:07.701
Thank you.

1:14:07.734 --> 1:14:08.535
You're in again.

1:14:08.568 --> 1:14:09.469
I can't wait.

1:14:09.502 --> 1:14:10.870
Congratulations, see you soon.

1:14:10.903 --> 1:14:11.872
Have a great day.

1:14:25.618 --> 1:14:29.389
It's Mr.
Joe, get the door.

1:14:29.421 --> 1:14:30.222
Hi, Mr. Joe.

1:14:30.256 --> 1:14:31.157
Hi, kid, hi, Deedee.

1:14:31.189 --> 1:14:32.524
Well good morning, Joe.

1:14:32.557 --> 1:14:33.460
Listen.

1:14:33.493 --> 1:14:35.261
I was wondering, you know,

1:14:35.293 --> 1:14:37.430
I'm playing in the
Arizona Jani King Open.

1:14:37.462 --> 1:14:38.364
That's awesome.

1:14:38.398 --> 1:14:40.065
I knew you were a pro.

1:14:40.099 --> 1:14:41.601
Would mean the world
to me if you two guys

1:14:41.634 --> 1:14:42.868
would come to the event.

1:14:42.902 --> 1:14:44.971
Oh Joe, we wouldn't
miss it for the world.

1:14:45.003 --> 1:14:46.139
I love you, Mr. Joe.

1:14:48.341 --> 1:14:49.543
I love you, kid.

1:14:51.210 --> 1:14:52.511
So here's the start time

1:14:52.545 --> 1:14:55.015
and the location address.

1:14:55.047 --> 1:14:56.615
I'll make sure there's
passes for you guys, okay?

1:14:56.649 --> 1:14:57.484
We'll be there.

1:14:57.516 --> 1:14:58.550
You've got this.

1:14:58.583 --> 1:14:59.653
Okay, see ya.

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:01.521
It's gonna be so fun.

1:15:01.554 --> 1:15:02.389
Yeah.

1:15:11.264 --> 1:15:12.332
Hello?

1:15:12.364 --> 1:15:14.600
Hey, sorry I missed your call.

1:15:14.634 --> 1:15:17.436
I heard the good
news, congratulations.

1:15:17.470 --> 1:15:19.873
I thought you might have
dropped by to come celebrate.

1:15:19.905 --> 1:15:22.042
I wanted to but
it's been a long time

1:15:22.074 --> 1:15:24.077
since I felt this good.

1:15:24.109 --> 1:15:27.680
I wanted to be alone to get
in touch with my thoughts.

1:15:27.713 --> 1:15:29.948
I hope they were
good thoughts.

1:15:29.981 --> 1:15:30.817
Yeah they were.

1:15:33.152 --> 1:15:34.854
Can we get together?

1:15:34.886 --> 1:15:35.854
I'd like that.

1:15:35.887 --> 1:15:37.990
How about dinner at my place?

1:15:38.024 --> 1:15:39.025
I'll text you my address.

1:15:39.057 --> 1:15:40.292
I'd like that.

1:15:40.326 --> 1:15:41.228
Okay, bye.

1:16:03.216 --> 1:16:04.051
Hmmm, ahh.

1:16:13.693 --> 1:16:14.494
Come in.

1:16:14.527 --> 1:16:15.795
Hi.

1:16:15.828 --> 1:16:16.930
Hi.

1:16:16.962 --> 1:16:18.597
Hope you like wine.

1:16:18.631 --> 1:16:19.432
I thought we could celebrate.

1:16:19.465 --> 1:16:22.235
Oh, oh great.

1:16:22.268 --> 1:16:23.869
Excuse my place, it's a mess.

1:16:23.903 --> 1:16:25.338
Oh, don't worry about it.

1:16:25.371 --> 1:16:26.506
I still have roommates.

1:16:30.976 --> 1:16:33.078
I wanted you to look like
the pro that you are.

1:16:33.112 --> 1:16:34.480
My god.

1:16:34.514 --> 1:16:35.981
That's incredible.

1:16:36.015 --> 1:16:37.650
I tried to get all
the wrinkles out.

1:16:37.682 --> 1:16:39.319
I'm blown away.

1:16:39.351 --> 1:16:42.221
Jen, this must have
cost you a fortune.

1:16:42.255 --> 1:16:43.222
Oh, don't worry about that.

1:16:43.256 --> 1:16:44.490
I can pick up a
couple extra shifts.

1:16:44.524 --> 1:16:45.492
It's no big deal.

1:16:45.524 --> 1:16:47.893
Besides, you deserve it.

1:16:47.926 --> 1:16:49.862
Oh, that means so much to me.

1:16:52.832 --> 1:16:54.300
Let me put this away

1:16:54.332 --> 1:16:55.300
and go get a couple glasses.

1:16:55.333 --> 1:16:56.869
- Sounds good.
- Have a seat.

1:16:56.903 --> 1:17:01.007
So everyone at the
cafe is so proud of you.

1:17:01.039 --> 1:17:02.609
Murphy's been talking
about you all day.

1:17:02.641 --> 1:17:05.077
Yeah, I may
have had a little help.

1:17:06.746 --> 1:17:11.184
You know, being humble is
a very attractive quality.

1:17:11.216 --> 1:17:12.851
Ah.

1:17:12.885 --> 1:17:16.456
Well then I'll have to
remember about that.

1:17:17.556 --> 1:17:18.925
Listen.

1:17:18.957 --> 1:17:22.060
It was you who paid my bill

1:17:22.094 --> 1:17:23.864
to the yoga
instructor, wasn't it?

1:17:25.030 --> 1:17:26.599
Just wanted to
help, that's all.

1:17:26.631 --> 1:17:29.969
Oh my god, that's
so incredibly sweet

1:17:30.002 --> 1:17:31.638
but I'm paying you back.

1:17:33.439 --> 1:17:35.542
Don't worry about it.

1:17:35.574 --> 1:17:36.408
Thank you.

1:17:38.211 --> 1:17:40.914
In that case, a toast.

1:17:42.014 --> 1:17:46.219
To the next Arizona
Open champion.

1:17:51.524 --> 1:17:52.325
Ah.

1:17:52.358 --> 1:17:53.193
Jen?

1:17:54.594 --> 1:17:56.229
I need to tell
you about my past.

1:17:58.564 --> 1:17:59.365
Mmm-mmm.

1:17:59.398 --> 1:18:00.900
I already know.

1:18:00.932 --> 1:18:02.167
And I have to tell you,

1:18:02.201 --> 1:18:06.006
I think what you're
doing is incredible.

1:18:09.041 --> 1:18:11.711
Joe, I know a healing heart.

1:18:12.878 --> 1:18:13.712
I've been there.

1:18:19.185 --> 1:18:23.823
I made some mistakes
along the line, but now,

1:18:23.855 --> 1:18:25.891
I feel incredible, unbeatable.

1:18:57.088 --> 1:18:59.192
It's getting hot in here.

1:19:23.114 --> 1:19:23.949
Ow, ow!

1:19:26.851 --> 1:19:28.153
What?

1:19:28.186 --> 1:19:29.756
Some people sleep
with teddy bears,

1:19:29.788 --> 1:19:31.623
I sleep with golf clubs.

1:19:31.657 --> 1:19:33.126
Ah, okay.

1:19:41.634 --> 1:19:42.469
Yeah.

1:19:46.972 --> 1:19:48.106
It's been a long time.

1:19:48.140 --> 1:19:49.576
Ooh!

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:09.496
I miss you guys.

1:20:15.434 --> 1:20:18.204
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

1:20:19.537 --> 1:20:21.473
I'm gonna follow your dreams.

1:20:21.506 --> 1:20:24.243
I'm gonna take my present
and I'm gonna be a golfer.

1:20:29.648 --> 1:20:31.284
I'm gonna do it.

1:20:36.855 --> 1:20:37.690
Goodbye.

Did you smell it first?

1:21:43.255 --> 1:21:44.724
Actually, I did.

1:21:44.756 --> 1:21:45.991
That's my girl.

1:21:46.024 --> 1:21:47.159
Are you hungry?

1:21:47.193 --> 1:21:48.795
Oh, hmm, yeah.

1:21:48.828 --> 1:21:49.629
I'm starving.

1:21:49.662 --> 1:21:51.564
Ooh, I'm impressed.

1:21:53.099 --> 1:21:55.435
Yeah, that makes
me happy, you know?

1:21:56.969 --> 1:21:58.503
It'd really be
nice if you'd come

1:21:58.537 --> 1:21:59.539
to the Open with me today.

1:21:59.572 --> 1:22:01.975
I'd really appreciate that.

1:22:04.643 --> 1:22:06.145
I was hoping you'd say that.

1:22:08.881 --> 1:22:10.850
So what time do you have
to leave for the course?

1:22:10.882 --> 1:22:11.783
A couple hours.

1:22:11.817 --> 1:22:13.485
Mmm, okay, I better get going.

1:22:13.519 --> 1:22:14.753
That doesn't give me
much time to get ready.

1:22:14.787 --> 1:22:15.954
Ooh.

1:22:15.988 --> 1:22:17.724
Let me feed you then.

1:22:19.891 --> 1:22:20.726
Mmmm.

1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:23.595
Mmm, it's good.

1:22:24.462 --> 1:22:26.965
I was hoping you'd say that.

1:22:28.967 --> 1:22:29.969
Mmmm.

1:22:30.002 --> 1:22:30.803
All right.

1:22:30.836 --> 1:22:31.838
Get, get ready, come on.

1:22:31.871 --> 1:22:33.005
All right, all
right, all right.

1:22:33.037 --> 1:22:34.039
Okay then.

1:22:35.006 --> 1:22:37.876
♪ Guess the word is gone ♪

1:22:57.662 --> 1:22:59.431
Now on
the tee, the golfer

1:22:59.465 --> 1:23:02.034
we've been talking about
for the past three days.

1:23:02.067 --> 1:23:05.704
The 50 something
year old, a miracle,

1:23:05.738 --> 1:23:07.073
can you believe it?

1:23:07.105 --> 1:23:09.876
A rookie in his late 50s.

1:23:09.908 --> 1:23:12.511
Who knew on Thursday
that Joe Bona,

1:23:12.545 --> 1:23:13.479
He's got it.

1:23:13.511 --> 1:23:14.579
- I know it.
- You got this,

1:23:14.613 --> 1:23:15.780
- Two Sugars.
- Did you ever believe

1:23:15.814 --> 1:23:16.914
we'd ever be here?

1:23:16.948 --> 1:23:18.817
Who could
possibly win the Arizona Open?

1:23:30.828 --> 1:23:33.666
Hit it out of
the ballpark, Joe.

1:23:57.055 --> 1:23:57.856
Go Joe!

1:23:57.890 --> 1:23:58.725
Go Joe!

1:24:18.743 --> 1:24:20.746
You got this, buddy.

1:24:20.779 --> 1:24:22.115
You never really needed me.

1:24:23.849 --> 1:24:26.351
Yeah, if it wasn't for
you, I wouldn't be here.

1:24:29.921 --> 1:24:31.523
You know what, I couldn't
have done it without you.

1:24:32.992 --> 1:24:35.828
You know what, you should
thank your Sophia for that.

1:24:35.860 --> 1:24:38.564
She only wanted the
best for you, Joe.

1:24:38.596 --> 1:24:39.765
Yeah, I loved Sophia.

1:24:41.199 --> 1:24:44.502
Without her, I couldn't
have been here.

1:24:44.536 --> 1:24:45.704
Please tell her

1:24:46.572 --> 1:24:48.007
that I'm here because of her.

1:24:49.875 --> 1:24:51.978
You got it, buddy.

1:24:52.011 --> 1:24:53.212
Go get 'em.

1:24:53.244 --> 1:24:55.715
Hey, buddy, who
you even talking to?

1:25:29.715 --> 1:25:31.350
He's
leaving in the pin.

1:25:31.382 --> 1:25:33.885
I guess I'll leave in the pin.

1:25:45.029 --> 1:25:46.131
So
there we have it.

1:25:46.164 --> 1:25:47.899
If Joe Bona makes this putt,

1:25:47.932 --> 1:25:52.537
he is the oldest rookie
to win the Arizona Open.

1:25:52.570 --> 1:25:55.408
If he misses it and
makes the next putt,

1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:59.010
the par putt, Joe will
force sudden death

1:25:59.043 --> 1:26:00.578
here at the Open.

1:26:00.612 --> 1:26:01.381
Here's the putt.

1:26:06.217 --> 1:26:07.787
You can do this, Two Sugars.

1:26:17.996 --> 1:26:19.297
Oh my god.

1:26:19.331 --> 1:26:21.667
Oh my god.

1:26:21.699 --> 1:26:23.769
Ladies and gentlemen, he did it.

1:26:23.801 --> 1:26:26.706
I can't believe he did it.

1:26:26.738 --> 1:26:31.743
Joe Bona, a 50 something
year old rookie

1:26:32.911 --> 1:26:35.681
just had his dream
round come true.

1:26:35.713 --> 1:26:37.716
He won the Arizona Open!

1:26:38.583 --> 1:26:40.153
This is incredible!

1:26:40.985 --> 1:26:42.587
This is incredible!
