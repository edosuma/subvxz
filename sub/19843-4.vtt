WEBVTT

00:35.280 --> 00:38.238
I dedicate myself to the service of all
beings of K'un-Lun...

02:31.480 --> 02:33.562
Ah, you're awake.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.599
What is this place?

02:38.610 --> 02:39.736
What happened to me?

02:41.450 --> 02:42.860
Last I remember, I was climbing up...

02:42.950 --> 02:45.692
Yeah, like goddamn Daredevil.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.360
Why'd you follow me?

02:49.040 --> 02:50.416
You kicked me off the building?

02:50.500 --> 02:51.819
Of course I did.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.377
It's what you do when you see someone
trying to break in.

02:54.460 --> 02:57.042
You are really pushing the limits
of karma.

02:57.130 --> 02:58.836
Now, boys.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.919
You see him, too?

03:10.270 --> 03:11.305
Danny.

03:15.650 --> 03:16.890
You died.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.941
- I saw pictures.
- Yeah.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.610
I did die.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.572
You look the same age
as when I last saw you.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.326
Your visit...

03:32.040 --> 03:33.246
It wasn't a hallucination.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.331
No.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.996
No, I had to see for myself.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.291
We had to protect ourselves, protect Rand.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.929
It's not every day that someone
comes back from the dead, is it?

03:50.520 --> 03:51.555
But here we are.

03:54.230 --> 03:57.563
So... Are we good?

04:05.700 --> 04:06.689
Danny?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.070
You're all I've got.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.296
You're home now.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.758
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting to hear that.

04:34.770 --> 04:35.839
So, wait.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.221
How are you still alive?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.236
I was diagnosed with cancer.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.038
Lung, pancreatic...
It attacked my whole body.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.571
I fought the good fight for three years,

04:54.920 --> 04:57.491
but, you know,
I kept getting worse and worse.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.047
Toward the end...

05:00.800 --> 05:02.756
I barely hit a hundred pounds.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.132
- Jesus.
- Yeah, tried him, too.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.290
Dad, are you sure
you should be saying this?

05:08.390 --> 05:11.462
It's okay. Danny needs to know this.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.097
So, there I was.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.391
Hadn't even gotten over losing
my best friend,

05:21.480 --> 05:22.981
not to mention you and Heather.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.481
I've got two kids to take care of.

05:26.820 --> 05:32.031
Their mom gone, and in the middle
of this... this misery...

05:34.000 --> 05:39.120
some people approach me with a cure,
and it placed me in their debt.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.739
And they cured you?

05:42.460 --> 05:43.836
- Just like that?
- No.

05:44.590 --> 05:47.582
No, what they failed to tell me
was that I had to die first.

05:52.430 --> 05:54.421
Yeah, I still remember my last breath.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.306
Scariest shit I've ever experienced.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.010
And three days later...

06:03.110 --> 06:04.316
I'm breathing again.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.276
So, who saved you?

06:06.530 --> 06:09.101
Well, you mentioned these people
during your stay at the hospital.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.815
You called them the Hand.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.322
The Hand? Here?

06:13.410 --> 06:15.947
Yeah, they're...
They're like the Illuminati, only real.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.611
They've infested Rand.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.081
That can't be.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.508
All of my years in training.

06:26.050 --> 06:29.793
All of it, just in case the Hand
ever showed its face in K'un-Lun.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.176
Yet you've never seen them?

06:32.260 --> 06:33.215
No.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.427
The story of the Hand was like a fable.

06:37.350 --> 06:40.558
More like Satan and his demons
than anything real.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.647
Nothing I thought
I'd actually have to fight.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.935
Oh, they are very real.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.351
And yet, here... Here you are.
How did you put it?

06:47.570 --> 06:49.526
Sworn enemy of the Hand?

06:49.660 --> 06:50.558
Yeah.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.271
It's what the Iron Fist is supposed to do.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.940
Is it something you're supposed to do?

06:59.250 --> 07:01.411
This Iron Fist,

07:01.580 --> 07:04.834
is that how you punched through
that steel door at the hospital?

07:04.960 --> 07:06.666
Yeah.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.928
Danny, help me get out
from under this evil.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.256
They won't let me
reveal myself to the world.

07:13.640 --> 07:17.098
They won't let me hold my own daughter
in my arms.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.596
- So, Joy doesn't know you're alive?
- No.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.431
No, I had to beg to let Ward
and my assistant know.

07:25.730 --> 07:29.314
Anyone else who discovered I was alive
was... was eliminated.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.446
Please don't tell Joy.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.826
I'll keep your secret.

07:35.030 --> 07:38.284
I wouldn't let anything happen to Joy.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.035
My
shifu
would've called this destiny.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.082
Then embrace your destiny.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.710
Well, I can't.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.592
Not if I'm stuck in the courts
trying to get back in Rand.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.301
Drop all litigation
against our friend here.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.590
No more roadblocks.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.939
Offer everything he's owed as the rightful
heir of Wendell Rand.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.146
Are you kidding me?

08:07.900 --> 08:12.985
Uh. No offense to Danny, but he's been
living in a monastery studying kung fu.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.770
This isn't a negotiation.

08:16.490 --> 08:17.445
Oh.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.368
Maybe we should give him
his dad's old office, while we're at it.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.200
Yeah, great idea. Make it happen, Ward.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.286
I've got big plans for you, Danny.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.529
Where should I start?

08:28.460 --> 08:30.291
What's the Hand doing in Rand?

08:30.380 --> 08:33.292
Well, that's unclear. I've only ever met

08:33.380 --> 08:36.463
a couple representatives of the...
of the Hand.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.462
You know, they show up in my home
whenever they want with their demands.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.886
What about now?

08:40.970 --> 08:42.267
Well, only recently they...

08:42.480 --> 08:45.938
they demanded we purchase a local pier
out near, uh, where... where was it?

08:46.730 --> 08:48.561
Red Hook.

08:48.770 --> 08:51.273
Yeah, Joy closed the deal on the pier.
Talk with her.

08:59.790 --> 09:03.078
We've needed a fighter like you
back in the family.

09:13.670 --> 09:16.924
Hey, maybe I could teach you
kung fu some time.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.176
Hey, that'd be great. Yeah.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.842
Feel free to call or come by any time.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.641
You need to watch yourself, Danny.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.652
I'm not afraid of the Hand.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.948
Good for you. I'm talking about Harold.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.444
Be careful.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.576
He's not a replacement for your dad.

09:50.540 --> 09:54.089
The only person Harold cares about
is Harold.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.965
Now watch this.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.096
Boom!

10:04.180 --> 10:06.387
- Sensei Wing knocked the shit out of him!
- Right.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.612
You know the rules
about cell phones in my dojo.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.572
Line up. Make
se/za.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.909
Darryl.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.629
I'm sorry, Sensei, but they never get to
see you go all out.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.369
No, it's me that needs to be sorry.

10:38.510 --> 10:40.637
I'm a hypocrite,
and I shouldn't have gone there.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.256
I don't need an apology.

10:42.430 --> 10:45.422
What you did was awesome.
I posted it online.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.425
You what?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.897
People gotta see what a badass you are,
and come for lessons.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.437
More students means more green.
It's a win-win.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.226
No, it's not.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.850
By fighting for money,

10:55.940 --> 10:58.272
I've stepped way outside
the code of Bushido.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.948
- It was a one-time mistake.
- That's bullshit.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.447
- Why else are we learning to fight?
- The scholarship.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.400
Like I'm ever
gonna get picked for that.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.077
Don't sell yourself short, Darryl.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.320
Line up.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.767
Push down your ego...

11:32.270 --> 11:33.305
...and let's begin.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.156
Why did you change your mind?

11:45.080 --> 11:48.698
I channelled my inner Dad.
Figured he'd want it this way.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.155
That's nice and all, but...

11:50.370 --> 11:53.248
have you put any serious thought
into what he's gonna do here?

11:54.210 --> 11:55.700
Hell ifI know.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.913
You're the one that opened the door
for Monastery Boy with the bowl.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.539
I know it was you.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.006
Danny's always been your soft spot.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.690
You clean up pretty good.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.327
The tie might be a touch effeminate.

12:28.450 --> 12:32.409
I like it. Come on.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.208
Thank you all for coming out on this
momentous occasion

12:41.470 --> 12:45.042
as Rand Enterprises welcomes Danny Rand
to his rightful place

12:45.140 --> 12:46.755
in the company
that bears his name.

12:48.010 --> 12:51.559
Danny will continue the legacy of his
father, Wendell,

12:51.890 --> 12:55.599
and join us in guiding this great company
into the future.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you: Danny Rand.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.981
That was great. Thanks.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.441
Step up, stick to the page and leave.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.921
Um...

13:26.130 --> 13:27.631
It's, uh...

13:29.430 --> 13:31.591
It's been a long road to get back home.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.762
And that's what Rand is to me. Home.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.970
My father, Wendell Rand,

13:39.060 --> 13:42.939
instilled in me a love and respect
for this company that has never faded.

13:43.780 --> 13:46.738
I left here, ten years old,
on a jet with my parents.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.651
We never reached our destination.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.827
I lost my family in that crash,

13:53.830 --> 13:55.741
and I became the lone survivor.

13:57.830 --> 14:01.379
I then was rescued by monks
and raised in a monastery,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.370
a much different life
to what I had here in New York.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.329
Ultimately...

14:09.800 --> 14:11.711
it taught me the value of life,

14:12.720 --> 14:14.130
of hard work,

14:14.810 --> 14:18.268
of never giving up
on the things that matter to me.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.562
And Rand matters.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.565
Mr Rand?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.777
- Mr Rand!
- Uh. Yes?

14:29.870 --> 14:31.314
Uh. Jenn/fer Many,
New York Bul/eﬂh.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.538
Is it true you were recently committed
to Birch Psychiatric Hospital

14:34.740 --> 14:37.288
and placed under the care
of Dr Paul Edmonds?

14:37.370 --> 14:38.951
Uh... Yes.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.876
- That's true.
- Oh, Danny.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.700
I, um...

14:43.710 --> 14:47.009
Coming back here... I don't know...

14:48.010 --> 14:50.797
Even though everything was familiar,

14:51.340 --> 14:53.638
it felt so overwhelming.

14:53.850 --> 14:56.557
I felt out of control.

14:57.310 --> 15:02.350
But thankfully, Joy and Ward
guided me to Dr Paul Edmonds

15:02.520 --> 15:03.976
to get the help I needed.

15:06.110 --> 15:07.987
I couldn't have come back strong
without them.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.908
Mr Rand, how long was your stay
at Birch Psychiatric Hospital?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.862
- And is it true you had violent outbursts?
- Thank you for coming out.

15:15.950 --> 15:17.030
Thank you.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.412
That answer was much kinder
than we deserved.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.967
As Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade,
says,

15:31.090 --> 15:33.217
"Kindness is the eternal law."

15:34.220 --> 15:37.303
Hey, look, have you got time to go through
that pier deal you put through?

15:37.390 --> 15:38.425
The pier? Why?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.511
I'm just, uh...
Just trying to get my bearings.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.680
Um...

15:42.770 --> 15:44.681
Yeah, just check with our assistant,
Megan.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.141
She'll set something up.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.389
Hey, morning, Megan.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.483
Um. Ijust wanted to, uh...
set up a meeting with Joy.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.276
I'll check her schedule.

15:52.530 --> 15:55.909
We should be able to squeeze you in
sometime in the next two or three days.

15:57.330 --> 15:58.399
Three days?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.150
In the meanwhile, your first appointment
of the clay is here.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.666
Oh, cool. Who?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.622
- Hey, J-Money!
- Ooh, we don't do that.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.041
Oh, okay.

16:10.420 --> 16:11.580
Thanks.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.519
Your father's office.
Even found his old desk.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.281
Now, don't get all weepy on me.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.781
I'm not. It's just, uh...

16:43.080 --> 16:45.207
It's been a while.

16:54.510 --> 16:55.750
Is everything okay down there?

16:55.970 --> 16:57.039
Oh, man.

16:57.930 --> 16:59.249
This is crazy.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.966
Man...

17:03.890 --> 17:05.437
Danny, what are you doing?

17:05.650 --> 17:10.144
Oh, I, uh... I used to stick stickers
under my dad's desk.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.316
They're still there.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.776
Of course you did.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.602
Now, we can continue
this walk down memory lane,

17:16.820 --> 17:20.199
but since it is all billable hours,
what do you say we get to work?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.708
For the record, I have never seen a deal
come together so fast.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.956
What did you do?

17:28.670 --> 17:32.083
Oh, I, uh...
pretty much had to raise the dead.

17:32.460 --> 17:36.578
Well, anyway, let's get you signing
these before anybody changes their minds.

17:37.680 --> 17:38.544
Okay.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.216
So, uh...

17:40.970 --> 17:42.301
What is my job?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.972
Well, you don't actually
hold a position here.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.806
- But I thought...
- Oh, let me... Let me explain.

17:48.020 --> 17:51.569
As 51% shareholder, you hold the most
dominant position on the board.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.489
So as much as you don't have a say
in the day-to-day business...

17:55.610 --> 17:58.022
- My voice will still be heard.
- Exactly.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.520
Yeah.

18:00.990 --> 18:03.823
Do you think we can get access to
the Rand business accounts and records?

18:04.040 --> 18:07.203
Well, with your name and your holdings,
shouldn't be much you can't access.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.081
Word to the wise?

18:11.630 --> 18:12.836
Ease into things.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.252
For most of these people,
you are a hostile takeover.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.790
Okay. Yeah, sure.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.256
No problem.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.718
I'm gonna send a courier to pick up these
contracts once you're done.

18:25.890 --> 18:27.016
Daniel...

18:28.600 --> 18:31.012
You have an extraordinary
opportunity here.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.316
Don't foul it up.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.901
So, um...

18:40.120 --> 18:42.076
Once I'm done signing all this...

18:43.490 --> 18:44.479
Then what?

18:47.580 --> 18:49.161
Door open, door closed?

18:50.960 --> 18:51.995
Open?

19:12.730 --> 19:14.220
Okay.

19:14.690 --> 19:18.729
Twelve million people are currently
infected with leishmaniasis

19:18.820 --> 19:20.526
in roughly 98 countries...

19:24.450 --> 19:25.530
Hi.

19:28.450 --> 19:29.451
Hey.

19:32.580 --> 19:33.626
Keep going.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.262
Hey, can I, uh,
just sit next to Joy?

19:47.470 --> 19:48.596
Thanks.

20:01.740 --> 20:02.729
Okay?

20:03.950 --> 20:09.240
Like I was saying, this anti-parasitic
antimonial will have far reaching effects.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.912
- There are approximately two million...
- Hey, what is this?

20:12.080 --> 20:15.243
Pricing strategy
for a new drug we patented.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.043
This will hit market in Asia, Africa,

20:18.130 --> 20:21.122
South and Central America,
even Eastern Europe.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.927
These are all possible customers.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.137
Which means we can make this in bulk,

20:25.220 --> 20:28.257
making the production price less than five
dollars a pill.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.886
So, we can sell for $50 per dosage.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.092
It'll fund new research, and give a nice
boost to our profit margin

20:34.310 --> 20:36.767
in the pharmaceutical division.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.778
Excuse me, but, um,
how many people die from, uh...

20:41.990 --> 20:43.275
What is it?

20:43.360 --> 20:45.066
Leishmaniasis.

20:45.160 --> 20:49.904
If left untreated, latest numbers show
roughly 50,000 a year.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.656
And we have the cure?

20:53.160 --> 20:57.335
We can save lives at five bucks a pill,
but you wanna raise the price?

20:57.540 --> 21:02.625
I know how this looks,
but this is how business is done.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.790
We should sell at cost.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.479
Hey, that's... That's not how it works.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.879
This is normal business.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.357
Then normal is not the best path to take.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.437
We can make our profits elsewhere.

21:19.650 --> 21:23.108
Please, Mr Rand. We know how to do this.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.654
The World Health Organisation will make
most of the purchases

21:26.780 --> 21:29.271
and subsidise it
for Third World countries.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.691
No one who needs this
will be left untreated.

21:31.830 --> 21:34.708
No one should make a profit
off of the misery of others.

21:34.910 --> 21:35.956
It's wrong.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.789
We need to sell the drug at cost. Period.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.080
To be clear, Danny,

21:45.470 --> 21:48.257
are you, as majority shareholder,

21:48.590 --> 21:51.969
drawing a line in the sand
on your first day?

21:56.270 --> 21:57.259
Yes.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.107
This is ridiculous.

21:59.310 --> 22:00.766
That may very well be,

22:00.860 --> 22:04.899
but if Mr Rand wants to put his foot down
on this, we'll do it.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.815
We'll go to market at cost.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.657
Thank you.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.821
Hey, um, my schedule cleared up.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.860
Do you wanna go talk about that pier deal?

22:16.580 --> 22:17.956
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

23:39.910 --> 23:40.956
Shit.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.766
Shit.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.405
Hey.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.947
Hey, yourse/ﬁ
Goodjob today.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.953
You handled Danny's introduction
to the world with real class.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.280
I couldn't have done it better.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.705
Thanks.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.041
What are you gonna do about that reporter?

25:09.710 --> 25:11.758
If you don't control the story, she will.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.330
I onn ’t put him in there.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.829
Oh, now, son.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.546
This isn't the time to point fingers.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.170
It’s the time for solutions.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.421
Can I count on you to handle
this reporter?

25:23.140 --> 25:24.220
I'll handle it.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.589
Mm-hm.

25:25.980 --> 25:28.141
Well, taking care of this
will more than make up

25:28.230 --> 25:30.471
for that drug pricing screw-up
this afternoon.

25:32.780 --> 25:35.487
Joy is keeping Danny busy.
It won't happen again.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.861
That's what I like to hear.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.656
Love you, son.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.455
Megan!

25:50.590 --> 25:51.625
Sir?

25:51.920 --> 25:54.047
Contact that reporter, Jennifer Many.

25:54.170 --> 25:58.960
Tell her I will answer all of _her
questions tonight In my office.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.147
These monks you hung with.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.564
They were, like, real deal, robe-wearing

26:12.650 --> 26:15.027
Shaolin-type bald monks?

26:15.190 --> 26:16.236
Yeah.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.060
- Huh.
- Pretty old school.

26:19.570 --> 26:22.824
So you were running around
the mountains wearing robes.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.209
Hey, you'd be pretty surprised at how
comfortable a good robe can be.

26:26.580 --> 26:31.745
Hmm, yeah. Just try not to come to work
wearing one of those robes, yeah?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.830
So I'm guessing, after this afternoon,

26:35.920 --> 26:37.922
you're pretty much regretting giving me
that bowl, right?

26:38.130 --> 26:39.210
Ha!

26:39.760 --> 26:41.637
Certainly was quite the entrance.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.306
While you weren't necessarily wrong...

26:44.390 --> 26:45.800
Yeah?

26:45.890 --> 26:48.688
...there was probably a better way for you
to win those people over

26:48.850 --> 26:51.808
than swinging your
51%-shareholder dick around.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.146
Well, when you put it like that.

26:56.070 --> 26:58.777
So, why did you give Jeri that bowl?

27:00.280 --> 27:02.521
Dredged up so many old memories,

27:03.530 --> 27:07.114
these feelings that I've,
I don't know, pushed down.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.785
Locked away.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.917
- That make any sense?
- Yeah.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.080
Yeah, it does.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.797
You coming back has...

27:17.920 --> 27:20.502
made me think about
all the people I've lost.

27:21.930 --> 27:23.545
You know, my parents...

27:25.180 --> 27:27.978
my mom, dad.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.226
You know, your dad...

27:34.320 --> 27:36.276
he really cared for you.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.908
You're lucky you didn't have to see him
at the end.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.405
It was horrible.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.206
Aanay. . .

27:54.000 --> 27:57.879
Your return made me take a hard look
at the person that I've become,

27:57.960 --> 27:59.257
and I didn't like it.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.508
I just didn't think that Dad would like it
either, so...

28:03.510 --> 28:05.171
had to do the right thing.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.347
You know, if it helps any,

28:08.720 --> 28:12.099
I think Harold would have been
crazy proud of you.

28:48.470 --> 28:49.880
That's the best you've got?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.387
Really? This guy's twice your weight.

28:55.190 --> 28:56.976
How about you add another fighter?

28:57.940 --> 28:59.726
And when I win, you double my payday.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.356
You are one crazy chick, you know that?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.149
ButI like it.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.026
You ready for the fight of your life?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.287
You better be! Hey!

29:14.670 --> 29:15.955
You better be!

29:16.170 --> 29:19.207
Because the Daughter of the Dragon
has returned!

29:22.010 --> 29:22.908
But...

29:23.300 --> 29:27.009
she doesn't think the Duke here
is enough of a challenge.

29:28.470 --> 29:33.339
So, on her request,
she wants a little two-on-one action.

29:35.270 --> 29:37.397
And I got just the guy for her.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.526
Jimmy Pierce, you still here?

29:42.780 --> 29:45.351
Jimmy! Jimmy!

29:48.570 --> 29:49.571
Ah!

29:51.240 --> 29:53.117
This little girl thinks she can fight me?

29:53.830 --> 29:54.990
Yeah!

29:57.250 --> 29:59.787
What can I tell ya? Bring it in.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.007
Look, you guys know all the rules, huh?

30:05.090 --> 30:06.967
Tap out or knockout's your only ways
out of this cage.

30:07.050 --> 30:08.677
Otherwise, whatever works. Hmm?

30:14.770 --> 30:16.681
Fight!

30:39.750 --> 30:40.739
Go! Go! Go!

31:00.440 --> 31:02.852
Stuck, little girl? Let's go.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.435
Get up!

32:00.500 --> 32:02.741
Why would Rand wanna buy this pier?

32:03.830 --> 32:05.081
I don't really know.

32:05.170 --> 32:07.627
Ward said to buy it.
I facilitated its purchase.

32:09.130 --> 32:12.588
Is that normal... for chief counsel to...

32:13.390 --> 32:15.130
buy things without knowing why?

32:15.510 --> 32:17.387
I don't really need to know the "why."

32:17.770 --> 32:21.683
Ward's leadership has led Rand to success
after success and...

32:22.560 --> 32:23.970
Why are you so interested in this?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.266
When I got to the...

32:26.480 --> 32:30.029
- The monastery, post-crash...
- Mm-hm.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.238
...I learned of a certain position.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.020
A powerful, important job,

32:37.330 --> 32:38.536
and I wanted it.

32:38.660 --> 32:41.572
Your dad always said
to set your goals high.

32:41.710 --> 32:42.916
Yeah.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.122
Everyone there, and I mean everyone,

32:45.380 --> 32:48.122
saio’ there was no way a
Xiaogu/iao
like me
could do it.

32:48.210 --> 32:51.338
.-/l .
X/aogU/I"
what?
- Yeah, it's, uh...

32:51.550 --> 32:55.338
It sort of means, like, uh, an outsider.
That's what they called me.

32:55.430 --> 32:56.795
Sounds kind of mean.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.927
Sort of cool, too.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.637
Besides, it... It just made me want the
job more.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.187
Yeah. Sure. I get that.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.300
So, problem was, I...

33:07.730 --> 33:11.359
I never thought through
why I wanted this job.

33:11.610 --> 33:16.024
I mistook my stubborn will for a sense of
destiny or something.

33:16.620 --> 33:20.238
_I never counted the cost of what
It would actually mean for my lIfe.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.070
- And you got the job?
- Yeah.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.151
I fought the whole way for it.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.620
I earned it.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.455
Was it worth it?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.951
Mm. I don't know.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.291
We'll see.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.131
So...

33:38.600 --> 33:40.556
How long you planning on staying here?

33:40.890 --> 33:42.846
I don't know.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.802
I've been pretty busy since I got here.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.056
After living in a monastery for 15
years...

33:48.400 --> 33:49.685
It's a big step up.

33:50.770 --> 33:51.680
Yeah.

33:53.650 --> 33:54.947
You have no idea.

33:56.070 --> 33:58.482
- First off, my room?
- Yeah?

33:58.820 --> 34:00.276
It was nothing like this.

34:01.830 --> 34:05.118
Six by six, a dirty mat on the floor.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.246
A blanket, you know.

34:07.330 --> 34:10.037
A literal pot to piss in.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.259
Every morning, I'd walk a mile uphill
with jugs the size of my torso,

34:16.380 --> 34:18.837
just to get mine and my
shifu’s
daily
ration of water.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.751
- Every morning?
- Every morning.

34:21.310 --> 34:24.177
That was the easy part.
Then it was training.

34:24.770 --> 34:26.476
All day, every day.

34:27.810 --> 34:32.099
When we weren't training, it was...
fighting, sparring.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.641
Every moment was a struggle.

34:39.450 --> 34:40.656
Failure...

34:41.950 --> 34:43.076
...led to a beating.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.826
Victory...

34:48.750 --> 34:51.127
led to the next fighting style,

34:52.250 --> 34:53.581
the next lesson.

34:56.510 --> 34:57.795
Sounds like abuse.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.218
Well...
...it made me what I am today.

35:06.850 --> 35:08.056
Which is what?

35:09.520 --> 35:10.930
I don't know.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.523
Another guy living in a deluxe apartment?

35:16.530 --> 35:18.236
You want a drink?

35:18.650 --> 35:19.981
Yes.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.901
You know how to make a vodka tonic?

35:23.280 --> 35:26.659
Well...
If it's just vodka and tonic, then, yeah.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.115
Ithink I can handle it.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.490
I'll get it.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.672
Um... Light on the tonic.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.270
Danny!

36:07.830 --> 36:08.785
Danny!

37:51.390 --> 37:52.516
Go!

37:54.690 --> 37:55.975
Hey. Hey.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.590
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:57.690 --> 37:58.975
- Okay.
- We have to call the police.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.641
- I know where they're going.
- What?

38:03.280 --> 38:04.895
You have no idea how bao’ it is.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.526
It's like we have goddamn Tarzan

38:07.860 --> 38:10.237
walking around the place,
fresh from the jungle.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.319
How so?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.360
I shouldn't be telling you this,

38:13.450 --> 38:16.533
but we have this drug that we've spent
years working on.

38:16.670 --> 38:17.910
We get it tested, patented...

38:18.040 --> 38:20.952
Now, I can't go into specifics,
but know this...

38:21.630 --> 38:22.915
This is a game changer.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.587
This drug will save millions of lives.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.460
- Wow.
- Right?

38:27.970 --> 38:30.962
So we're in our pricing-strategy meeting,
getting ready to boost the price,

38:31.050 --> 38:35.009
make a huge profit, and be able to fund
years' worth of new lab research.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.010
Sure.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.476
In walks Danny,

38:37.600 --> 38:41.058
and he uses the full weight
of his majority shareholdings

38:41.480 --> 38:45.029
to force us to sell the drug at cost.

38:47.610 --> 38:49.271
At cost.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.656
You're kidding me.

38:51.780 --> 38:53.031
Mm-mm.

38:53.910 --> 38:57.494
That is a loss of hundreds
of millions of dollars.

38:57.660 --> 38:58.911
He is worse than these...

38:59.420 --> 39:05.086
bleeding-heart-liberal-trust-fund
hipsters wandering around Williamsburg.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.370
Uh. Thanks for the interview.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.758
What, you're leaving so soon?
We've got bourbon to finish.

39:11.890 --> 39:15.098
Tempting, but, uh,
I have an early morning deadline.

39:16.390 --> 39:19.518
Ellison? Listen,
don't give the front page to Karen.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.551
I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.

40:14.950 --> 40:17.327
- What happened to you?
- What happened to you?

40:17.660 --> 40:19.287
That's why I'm here.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.998
Hey, can you, uh...
Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.661
Wasn't he stalking you?

40:24.790 --> 40:26.621
- It was a misunderstanding.
- Right.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.587
I guess being a millionaire
covers a multitude of sins.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.080
Billionaire.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.671
What do you know about the Golden Sands?

40:35.220 --> 40:36.380
I don't know.

40:36.850 --> 40:38.966
There's a bunch of Chinese restaurants
with that name, but...

40:39.060 --> 40:41.016
Any of them attached to hatchet-wielding
criminals?

40:41.730 --> 40:42.936
You know 'em?

40:43.560 --> 40:44.436
Triads.

40:45.270 --> 40:46.476
Dangerous.

40:46.730 --> 40:47.936
Sounds right.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.238
This is the Golden Sands
you're lookIng for.

40:55.160 --> 40:59.119
It’s a front for the
Yangshi Gongsl,
the Yang Clan Company.

41:00.580 --> 41:01.956
I need to have a word with them.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.575
Are you kidding me?

41:03.670 --> 41:05.661
Why do you wanna
mess around with Triads?

41:20.220 --> 41:22.381
Hello, can I help you?

41:25.480 --> 41:27.050
I'm sorry, we're closed.

41:27.190 --> 41:29.727
I need to speak to the head
of the
Yangshi Gongsi

41:37.450 --> 41:38.610
I don't want any trouble.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.368
Then you should not
come looking for it.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.955
Eh?

41:56.590 --> 41:58.217
I am Yang Hai-Qing,

41:58.890 --> 42:00.596
head of the
Yangshi Gongsi

42:01.140 --> 42:02.300
And you are?

42:04.770 --> 42:06.010
Danny Rand.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.227
Of Rand Enterprises?

42:09.110 --> 42:10.509
One and the same.

42:11.940 --> 42:14.067
Why did you send your men
after Joy Meachum?

42:14.650 --> 42:17.483
Why did your company steal
our pier away from us?

42:17.740 --> 42:18.775
What?

42:18.910 --> 42:20.696
We had a deal with the previous tenant.

42:20.780 --> 42:24.443
Joy Meachum broke that deal.
We wanted words with her.

42:24.540 --> 42:25.529
No.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.951
You wanted to kidnap Joy
to broker a new deal.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.873
Maybe we should use you
to broker a new deal.

42:34.090 --> 42:35.830
Is this why you walk into my place?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.881
I'm here to let you know it's not within
your best interest

42:39.090 --> 42:40.887
to come near Joy ever again.

42:44.060 --> 42:49.009
Why is Rand so determined to keep the pier
all to itself?

42:50.270 --> 42:52.977
Look, another group of people forced us to
purchase it.

42:53.980 --> 42:58.656
Who could force a giant business like Rand
to do anything?

43:02.950 --> 43:04.440
I had no idea.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.913
Please extend our deepest apologies to
Miss Meachum.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.702
Do you have any idea what the Hand
are doing with the pier?

43:15.130 --> 43:16.199
Why are they in New York?

44:00.090 --> 44:01.421
Put it on.

44:12.480 --> 44:13.765
Where are we going?

44:14.360 --> 44:15.475
For a ride.

44:19.780 --> 44:21.099
Okay, exhale.

44:24.070 --> 44:25.526
- Better.
- Yeah.

44:25.700 --> 44:26.780
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

44:28.620 --> 44:30.497
I read you and Danny grew up together.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.116
Yeah.

44:32.710 --> 44:34.029
Parents were best friends.

44:34.420 --> 44:36.957
Joke around the house was _
Danny and I were pledged to be married.

44:37.090 --> 44:39.297
That's pretty close.

44:43.550 --> 44:44.960
He was a good kid.

44:45.970 --> 44:48.006
He was kind.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.558
If you would've told me that one day
he would fight off men with axes...

44:51.690 --> 44:53.226
Hatchets.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.806
They won't be a problem anymore.

44:55.940 --> 44:57.851
And how did you do that?

44:58.360 --> 44:59.679
We just had a talk.

44:59.900 --> 45:01.390
This talk happen with your fists?

45:01.950 --> 45:05.158
Uh. It's... more of a sharing of ideas.

45:05.410 --> 45:08.026
We, um... We came to an agreement.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.666
What... What are you doing?

45:15.460 --> 45:18.372
How did you put it, Joy?
This ain't my first rodeo?

45:19.920 --> 45:22.627
Look, I can pop it back into place. Easy.

45:31.930 --> 45:33.841
So... Back in K'un-Lun,

45:33.980 --> 45:36.687
my
shifu
would make me count to three
in Mandarin before he would fix it.

45:41.190 --> 45:42.737
Yee...

45:42.990 --> 45:44.730
Shit!

45:52.660 --> 45:55.572
Look, if this is about fighting
for cash...

45:56.710 --> 45:58.780
- What?
- Hey, I'm notjudging.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.667
I used to fight
in a few illegal fight clubs

46:00.750 --> 46:02.331
on my way back from K'un-Lun.

46:02.630 --> 46:03.915
But just so you know,

46:04.260 --> 46:06.376
I'm more than willing to pay up
on our previous deal.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.131
I still owe you rent for six months.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.095
Answer is the same.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.016
Thank you, though.

46:21.110 --> 46:23.396
All right, let's make a move.

46:28.870 --> 46:31.942
- See you around.
- Yeah. Thanks.

46:39.750 --> 46:41.877
So how are we gonna tell Ward?

46:44.510 --> 46:47.752
He finds out men with hatchets attacked
his sister?

46:48.130 --> 46:50.212
I thought you said you didn't want
the cops involved.

46:50.470 --> 46:52.597
Hm. Good point.

46:58.560 --> 47:02.644
That doesn't mean I don't wanna_ know
what the hell was gomg on tonight.

47:03.730 --> 47:06.437
Yeah. You and me both.

47:15.250 --> 47:16.399
See you.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.138
You have been a good and faithful
servant to the Hand.

47:33.850 --> 47:35.465
The pier was secured.

47:36.060 --> 47:38.802
Now, receive your reward.

48:04.460 --> 48:08.009
I haven't seen her in _
person snnce she was a Child.

48:19.060 --> 48:20.880
Someone hit my daughter?

48:21.770 --> 48:24.933
My people said she had a run-in
with some criminals.

48:25.940 --> 48:29.182
She's luclq she has such a talented
bodyguard.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.059
She's fine now.

48:38.490 --> 48:42.449
Could this good and faithful servant ask
for one more favour?

49:17.580 --> 49:18.945
What do you want?

49:19.160 --> 49:21.242
Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?

49:24.580 --> 49:25.706
Me.

50:14.170 --> 50:16.047
I'm ready to go home now.
