02:56.816 --> 02:59.084
The season, your four finalists
are going to sing three times

02:59.219 --> 03:01.487
Tonight.
A new song that they picked and

03:01.621 --> 03:04.623
A holiday song, plus going to
perform a duet with their coach.

03:04.758 --> 03:08.093
It is going to be an
unbelievable night of music.

03:08.228 --> 03:09.261
Every single vote obviously is
crucial.

03:09.396 --> 03:12.398
We will kick things off with a
pop singer from kentucky who

03:12.532 --> 03:13.832
Continues to impress with every
performance.

03:13.967 --> 03:19.505
I had a chance to sit down with
jordan smith and his coach, adam

03:19.639 --> 03:22.074
Levine, to talk about what this
"voice" experience has meant to

03:22.208 --> 03:25.110
Him.
Take a look.

03:25.245 --> 03:28.647
>> before the voice, i was
working two jobs to pay my way

03:28.782 --> 03:33.852
Through college and stepping on
that stage was such an

03:33.987 --> 03:37.022
Overwhelming feeling for me.
All four chairs turned.

03:37.157 --> 03:38.424
What did it feel like to get
that validation?

03:38.558 --> 03:40.926
>> just incredible.
I have worked so long and hard

03:41.061 --> 03:44.897
And i had to deal with being
different and prove it is past

03:45.031 --> 03:47.066
Looking on the outside.
>> i remember when i saw you

03:47.200 --> 03:50.736
Perform, i thought to myself,
this dude is just a special guy.

03:50.870 --> 03:53.172
The world needs a person like
you.

03:53.306 --> 03:56.175
I think you are the most
important person ever been on

03:56.309 --> 03:59.378
This show
>> once you go live, your

03:59.512 --> 04:02.548
Playoff song is beyonce.
How you're going to up to

04:02.682 --> 04:06.285
America.
You go on a gave-week run, which

04:06.419 --> 04:08.854
We have never had on the show,
top ten on the itunes charts,

04:08.988 --> 04:12.157
Two of which was number one.
>> i didn't think about it, i

04:12.292 --> 04:14.360
Just knew these were songs i
connected with in my heart.

04:14.494 --> 04:17.129
>> that queen performance that
note you hit, you dug deep.

04:17.262 --> 04:24.069
>> i think the best performance
in the history of the show.

04:24.204 --> 04:26.972
>> there has been a lot of talk
about you being a front-runner

04:27.107 --> 04:28.440
But still one more big night of
music.

04:28.575 --> 04:32.811
>> there comment be a more
suited finale song for you than

04:32.946 --> 04:36.615
This one.
¶ climb every mountain ¶

04:36.750 --> 04:40.319
>> the kind of person that
jordan is and the way that he

04:40.453 --> 04:41.720
Sings lends itself to this
message.

04:41.855 --> 04:44.323
About kind of chasing your
dreams down but also doing it in

04:44.457 --> 04:47.860
A very inspirational way.
There's just a lot of heart in

04:47.994 --> 04:50.028
It and jordan is all heart, so
it's perfect.

04:50.163 --> 04:51.830
Follow every rainbow has to be
big and powerful every time.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.866
>> okay.
>> we are still fighting.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.801
>> always this pressure to live
up to what you did the week

04:55.935 --> 04:58.437
Before.
You never want to, like, peak,

04:58.571 --> 05:00.139
Which is funny, because they are
talking about climbing every

05:00.273 --> 05:03.375
Mountain.
>> i see what you did there.

05:03.510 --> 05:07.012
I see what you did.
¶ follow every rainbow ¶

05:07.147 --> 05:11.183
If i'm not the winner of the
voice, i still know that i found

05:11.317 --> 05:15.220
Myself.
Gonna know that i worked for

05:15.355 --> 05:17.923
This.
Now is the time when i can stand

05:18.057 --> 05:19.925
Up and show the world this is
who i am and you can be who you

05:20.059 --> 05:25.097
Are, too.
>> what people love about you is

05:25.231 --> 05:26.532
Something beyond your your
talent, it is just your ability

05:26.666 --> 05:27.733
To be inspired and that inspires
people.

05:27.867 --> 05:30.669
>> this experience has
absolutely changed my life.

05:30.804 --> 05:33.939
>> man, i'm just so proud of
you.

09:39.852 --> 09:42.587
Ichblts a he sure i know why he

09:42.722 --> 09:46.158
All frustrated, when you come to
us after jordan performs,

09:46.292 --> 09:51.863
There's nothing left to say
anymore.

09:51.998 --> 09:55.400
It's like -- you're always just
so consistent, but consistently

09:55.535 --> 09:56.501
Great.
Just great.

09:56.636 --> 09:59.738
Not good.
Not okay.

Not got through the song.
Like great, every time you get

10:02.041 --> 10:04.009
On the stage, dude.
It's boring to hear me talk

About it.
I know it is.

10:06.679 --> 10:13.518
[ applause ]

10:13.653 --> 10:18.390

things, to organize my thoughts

Here but i'm just gonna tell you
what's amazing about this guy is

11:39.372 --> 11:44.709
Not -- my belief in jordan is
fine, but jordan's belief in

11:44.844 --> 11:48.647
Himself and the humble nature
with which he projects that into

11:48.781 --> 11:52.584
The world is one of the most
beautiful things i've ever seen.

11:52.718 --> 11:56.788
And he -- he deserves to win the
show, that would be great and

11:56.923 --> 11:58.723
Everything, but he is so

You have such a classic voice
and i know week after week, i
say the same thing about you,

16:43.008 --> 16:47.278
But it's really -- it's really a
true testament to, like, your
consistency.

16:47.413 --> 16:52.183
You consistently come out here
and do something very classic
every week and that's different,

16:52.318 --> 16:55.653
Man.
It's special.
And i really look forward to

16:55.788 --> 16:59.357

career 'cause you definitely

Country guy and --
[ woman screams ]
>> okay.

17:15.641 --> 17:19.711
Calm down.
I think when someone is so
incredible as far as country

17:19.845 --> 17:25.517
Music is concerned, we can tell
what the real deal is and if i'm
not mistaken, mr. Shelton, i'm

17:25.651 --> 17:30.655

the real deal.

17:54.947 --> 18:00.418
About your performance is you

start off simple and as the song

18:00.553 --> 18:04.989
Goes along, as the song builds,
that's when you start throwing
in all the power and stuff and

18:05.124 --> 18:10.461
It makes for these incredible
performances that you can't look
away from.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.130

performance quite like bar e

18:58.611 --> 19:02.013
And bar it's determination this
partnership proved to be an
unstoppable match.

19:02.147 --> 19:11.022
Tonight, they chose the perfect
song to sing together.
¶ where hustle's the name of the

19:11.156 --> 19:14.892
Game ¶
¶ and nice guys get washed away
like the snow and the rain

¶
>> the more i do this shock the
more i realize how much people

19:19.965 --> 19:25.470

Cowboy" dude.
>> pretty awesome.
>> i thought, yes.

19:31.277 --> 19:37.982
That's why i love barrett.
¶ where the lights are shining
on me ¶

19:38.117 --> 19:43.988

>> exciting to give a tribute to
a guy like glen campbell, man, a

19:44.123 --> 19:46.457
Pioneer, just from arkansas,
man, just like -- it's a perfect
song.

19:46.592 --> 19:49.327
>> not to mention it is a
shoutout to trying to make it in
the music industry.

19:49.461 --> 19:53.598
>> totally.
The letter sic perform.
You're down when you're riding

19:53.732 --> 19:57.035
Your train, taking the long way,
that's what my life has been so
far to get here.

19:57.169 --> 20:01.239
Took the scenic route.
Feels good, you no?
He a lot of good things about

20:01.373 --> 20:09.814
That i got my wife and my kids
out of that's specially.
>> i think the studio is where

20:09.948 --> 20:13.885
You really learn to become a
better singer.
I do believe that.

20:14.019 --> 20:17.822
That's when you hear some of the
stuff you don't want to hear
from yourself when you're in

20:17.956 --> 20:21.693
Those headphones and there's
nothing to hide behind, this
teaches you to be a better

20:21.827 --> 20:26.898
Singer.
>> come listen.
Sounds amazing.

20:27.032 --> 20:31.436
¶ the subway token and a dollar
tucked inside my shoe ¶
>> thing people don't realize

20:31.570 --> 20:36.341
About this show is now when you
leave, you're going to be trying
to get back to the level of what

20:36.475 --> 20:38.509
This show gives artists, you
know?
>> mm-hmm.

20:38.644 --> 20:43.314
>> the staging, with the
coverage and being on television
and stuff, you know what i mean?

20:43.449 --> 20:47.518
It just gives you the
opportunity to now achieve that
again at some point on your own.

20:47.653 --> 20:53.491
I think you will do that.
I do think that, barrett.
>> and now is the fun part.

20:53.625 --> 21:02.700
I'm excited about it.
I can't wait to attack it.

31:00.131 --> 31:05.436
Duet.

Just performing every week and
picking new things to do
>> that's all you should be

31:12.844 --> 31:17.047
Focused on.
It can get easy to get caught up
in all this, but you kept a

31:17.182 --> 31:21.986
Level head, which i always think
is the cornerstone for anyone
that has success on the show.

31:22.120 --> 31:29.026
Now, get to this beach boys
classic, "god only knows" best
song ever written,

31:29.160 --> 31:34.231
Heart-crushing, most inspiring
melody i've ever heard.
¶ i may not always love ¶

31:34.366 --> 31:38.335
¶ but long as there are stars
above you ¶
beach boys do it, like the

31:38.470 --> 31:45.609
Little bit of rub.
It's like groovy and sounds cool
and it is not, like, perfect.

31:45.744 --> 31:52.683
Let's leave it loosey-goosey and
organic and i think like
faithful to the original.

31:52.817 --> 31:56.954
¶ if you should ever leave me ¶
i love the unison.
Sounds pretty together.

31:57.088 --> 31:59.723

Ever been on.
I know this studio well.

Able to say i have done this
with you as my coach.

>> final four.
>> man.
>> proud of you, buddy.

36:22.153 --> 36:25.656
>> thanks a lot.
Whew.
This has been such a long ride,

36:25.790 --> 36:29.293
Man.
I'm one step away from winning
"the voice."

36:29.427 --> 36:35.465
It's almost amazing to even say
that, because it wasn't that
long ago that i was miles away.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.036
¶
>> the blind auditions, what did
you think was going to happen

36:39.170 --> 36:43.640
When you came out on our stage?
>> as soon as i saw the chairs
turn, it was the most weight off

36:43.775 --> 36:49.946
My shoulders.
>> i feel like i'm watching
garth brooks in concert now.

36:50.081 --> 36:53.650
>> we get into live playoff, do
you lee brice.
¶ i drive your truck ¶

36:53.785 --> 36:57.120
>> you said it was the first
time you really saw his work
ethic.

36:57.255 --> 37:03.327
>> barrett's really good at
being conscious of what the
audience is feeling out there.

37:03.461 --> 37:06.663
¶ lay you down and till you all
the things ¶
>> see this relationship with

37:06.798 --> 37:10.500
Blake shelton, what would you
want them to know about your
coach?

37:10.635 --> 37:14.171
>> the cool part is he allows me
to come into this space and
throw idea at him for how to

37:14.305 --> 37:17.607
Make a song mine.
>> i'm pointed tock the top ten
in itunes right now.

37:17.742 --> 37:21.978
>> before i came to "the voice,"
i was teach act a high school
and all of a sudden, i'm the

37:22.113 --> 37:28.185
Student instead of the teacher
and that's really awesome.
>> what are you singing in the

37:28.319 --> 37:34.658
Finale?
>> it is a new country song but
has a real throwback vibe to it.

37:34.792 --> 37:38.995
¶ if all i've got is your hand
in mine ¶
>> this is the perfect song

37:39.130 --> 37:43.166
Because it has got that soulful
edge that barrett brings to
country music.

37:43.301 --> 37:45.569
Sounds so good.
>> we have seen your kids and
your wife and it feels like

37:45.703 --> 37:50.006
You're singing for them every
time you're an at stage.
>> this moment, you know, is

37:50.141 --> 37:54.578
About sacrifices that my wife
has made and she is the one
chase the kids around and so,

37:54.712 --> 37:59.015
This dream of mine, it's ours,
together.
>> hey, buddy.

37:59.150 --> 38:03.286
>> hey, brooke.
What does that shirt say?
Team baber.

38:03.421 --> 38:07.657
I have gotten all this success,
new fans.
Didn't have that when i came in.

38:07.792 --> 38:10.627
All i had was my wife and my
kids.
That's what i love about this

38:10.762 --> 38:13.029
Song.
It talks about what is most
important to me.

38:13.164 --> 38:17.634
>> if you can find somewhere to
have a big note at the end, this
is the time to do that.

38:17.769 --> 38:23.707
>> yeah.
¶ your hand in my hand ¶
>> yes.

38:23.841 --> 38:28.779
You got to do that.
All the hard work he has put
into it, it is paying off right

38:28.913 --> 38:31.581
Now.
I'm so happy for him.
>> awesome and so grateful for t

38:31.716 --> 38:36.820
>> music is what you were meant
to do i have no doubt about
that, man.

38:36.954 --> 38:50.100
>> carson: With "die a happy
man," please welcome back

38:50.234 --> 38:58.942
¶ oooo

38:59.076 --> 39:07.250
One of the best nights ¶
¶ that i've had no doubt
between the bottle of wine

39:07.385 --> 39:13.490
And that look in your eyes
and the marvin gaye ¶
¶ and we danced in the dark

39:13.624 --> 39:19.763
Under september stars
in the pourin' rain
and i know ¶

39:19.897 --> 39:23.400

ever say it enough
that all i need

39:23.534 --> 39:31.675

The northern lights
or if i never get to see ¶

¶ you're a goddess

40:17.522 --> 40:23.360
The cutest, the hottest
the masterpiece

and i know

40:32.103 --> 40:36.106
That i can't ¶
¶ ever tell you enough

No fancy destination
you're my great escape
we can stay at home ¶

40:56.994 --> 41:06.736
¶ or listen to the radio
or dance around the fireplace
ooo

41:06.871 --> 41:12.976
If i never ¶
¶ get to build my
mansion in georgia

41:13.110 --> 41:21.818
Or drive a sports car
up the coast of california ¶
¶ woah, if all i got

Get some comments.
Gwen, you're crying tonight.

42:23.114 --> 42:27.450
Maybe more emotional.
>> i'm just like -- i had -- i
felt like i was on another

42:27.585 --> 42:32.455
Planet through that whole thing,
just thinking about your whole
journey and when you first came

42:32.590 --> 42:36.660
Out here and you're just -- your
vibe, like your energy is so
strong.

42:36.794 --> 42:42.232
And i feel like tonight, for me,
like it all came together
because i feel like you just

42:42.366 --> 42:45.935
Were so calm in that
performance, in just letting it
come out and telling a story, it

42:46.070 --> 42:49.406
Was really, really good.
[ applause ]
and they are so cute.

42:49.540 --> 42:55.278
>> thank you.
>> carson: Adam.
>> you know, i'm just -- i'm

42:55.413 --> 42:59.249
So -- i feel so lucky because i
have been able to see my
favorite people make it to the

42:59.383 --> 43:03.319
End, like my four favorite
people are in the finals and
it's rarely the case.

43:03.454 --> 43:07.457
You never know.
And i'm just a fan of yours.
I always have been from the

43:07.591 --> 43:09.793
Beginning.
Yeah.
I always enjoy what you do, from

43:09.927 --> 43:13.029
Day one.
>> thanks, dude.
>> carson: All right.

43:13.164 --> 43:16.366
Let's hear what your coach has
to say.
Blake?

43:16.500 --> 43:20.870
>> let me tell you something, i
mean, aside -- stop talking
about your technical abilities

43:21.005 --> 43:24.874
And things when it comes to your
singing, there's a reason you
need to the finale, because

43:25.009 --> 43:30.413
That's part of it.
But i think the thing that gwen
is talking about is the same

43:30.548 --> 43:35.985
Thing that i just noticed and
that's i don't know that i've
ever worked with anybody who

43:36.120 --> 43:41.291
Puts more heart into their
performances than you, barrett.
I mean, every single time you

43:41.425 --> 43:45.195
Get on that stage, man, you just
lay your heart out there for
everybody to see.

43:45.329 --> 43:47.464
And i admire you for that, dude.
Great job.
>> thanks, man.

43:47.598 --> 43:51.501
>> carson: If you want barrett
to be the winner of "the voice,"
you can vote on nbc.Com, "the

43:51.635 --> 43:54.904

Tonight, a duet that perfectly
fits this partnership.

44:18.162 --> 44:22.398
Huge moment on the show why not

duet?

44:22.533 --> 44:24.567

44:24.702 --> 44:26.202

Too, it is not like
overpowering.
Just got to go in there and be

45:09.079 --> 45:12.649
Emily ann, god knows i'm no
kenny rogers.
One thing people love about you

45:12.783 --> 45:18.755
Is that you don't sound like
anybody else.
¶ everything is nothing if you

45:18.889 --> 45:25.962
Got no one ¶
¶ and you're walking the night
slowly losing sight of the real

45:26.096 --> 45:29.199
Thing ¶

You can teach me your move.

45:29.333 --> 45:34.103

After being away from it for six
years.
Aid chance to sit down with team

50:26.130 --> 50:30.466
Gwen's jeffery austin and his
coach to talk about what this
show means to him.

50:30.601 --> 50:34.036
Have a look.
Jeffery austin, you were this
close to not being here.

50:34.171 --> 50:41.878
>> very weird to think that i
was even at a desk doing public
relations.

50:42.012 --> 50:47.283
After high school, i was way too
scared to pursue music.
>> your mind audition, come out,

50:47.417 --> 50:50.052
Sam smith, hear this voice,
gwen.
I can't believe you were the

50:50.187 --> 50:53.289
Only person that turned around.
>> i was shocked nobody else
turned.

50:53.423 --> 50:57.160
>> what sorts of things were you
telling jeffery as this
competition was going on?

50:57.294 --> 51:01.030
>> i think it was almost undoing
him, okay, let's zip off this
layer and we are going to see

51:01.165 --> 51:04.033
What's underneath there.
You are going to walk toward him
and let him know that you're

51:04.168 --> 51:08.437
Changing your mood.
I was just being as honest as i
could be with him.

51:08.572 --> 51:11.174
There's a, like, tiny percent
that i don't believe.
>> okay.

51:11.308 --> 51:14.076
Every time that i've given
something that she didn't
believe --

51:14.211 --> 51:19.382
>> she called you on it?
>> yeah, so, i can't thank her
enough.

51:19.516 --> 51:23.119
Thank you.
The live playoffs finally felt
like i was breaking through

51:23.253 --> 51:27.890
Emotionally.
>> you could really win this
whole thing.

51:28.025 --> 51:33.429
>> for the top ten, you did
"jealous" by labyrinth.
¶ hard for me to say ¶

51:33.564 --> 51:37.400
>> it felt like something i
would want to do after the show
on my album, if i ever get to

51:37.534 --> 51:42.838
Make one.
When did you cher "believe" you
were number thrown at overall i

51:42.973 --> 51:48.978
Tunes chart.
¶ to you believe in life after
love ¶

51:49.112 --> 51:51.547
And i got a full-blown cher
tweet laced with emother-in-law
jesse.

51:51.682 --> 51:56.219
>> what did that mean to you?
>> everything.
And i did come out there

51:56.353 --> 52:10.733
Swinging when you didn't call my
name to vote me through.
>> you sang "make it rain" like

52:10.867 --> 52:13.869
No way you were gonna leave.
.
>> that was the most incredible

52:14.004 --> 52:20.042
Performance ever, ever, ever.
>> you deserve to win.
¶ be begging you baby, begging

52:20.177 --> 52:24.013
You not to leave ¶
>> flip a country song doesn't
happen very often and makes

52:24.147 --> 52:28.184
Sense it is such an emotional
thing that is your whole thing.
>> it feels like, in my gut,

52:28.318 --> 52:33.289
Something i connect to.
>> right.
¶ why don't you stay

52:33.423 --> 52:37.526
¶ spot for the show, i need to
channel that energy, the instant
save for me, so there's really

52:37.661 --> 52:42.098
No going back.
>> everything you did that night
has to happen again and more.

52:42.232 --> 52:44.367
>> oh, it's gonna happen.
>> that's how, right there.
Look at that

52:44.501 --> 52:56.946
>> yeah.

Say anymore to all four of you
finalists.
You guys are all so incredible.

56:43.173 --> 56:49.545
But i will say this about you,
jeffery, you're the guy that,
from the blind auditions to now,

56:49.679 --> 56:56.051
You snuck up on all of us and
every time you get on that
stage, you make even more of a

56:56.186 --> 57:00.322

amazing feeling for you, you

57:12.102 --> 57:21.477
Journey on this season like this
and to think that you know, you
hadn't been singing for six

57:21.611 --> 57:23.746
Years or performing for six
years.
I can't imagine you're not

57:23.880 --> 57:29.218
Inspiring somebody who put down
the microphone for a bit and
said i'm not doing this anymore,

57:29.352 --> 57:34.123
You're going to inspire somebody
to pick it back up and do what
they're supposed to be doing

57:34.257 --> 57:37.459
With their lives.
>> carson: And your coach, gwen?
>> i'm standing up, because i

57:37.594 --> 57:39.728
Feel like this is my chance,

57:49.606 --> 57:59.248
Problem with you is that you can

what it is that you guys are

01:02:31.054 --> 01:02:37.893
Doing, 'cause all of you guys
are like so incredibly talented,
but i will say that, you know,

01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:44.433
Your whole life story, you know,
it just -- it comes out every
time you sing.

01:02:44.567 --> 01:02:48.570
And that's -- that's an amazing
ability that you have, man.
You touch people every time you

01:02:48.705 --> 01:02:55.711
Sing.
It's 'cause you sing your story
and that's -- that's next level.

01:02:55.845 --> 01:02:58.947
Congratulations.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.923
Coming up with things to say to
these people.
Like, i love you, dude, i always

01:03:08.057 --> 01:03:13.996
Have and you're amazing.
And like you're still amazing.
Yeah.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:17.833
All right.
[ applause ]
i mean, i've been a huge fan of

01:03:17.967 --> 01:03:21.870
Yours for a long time and you
did an amazing job, again.
Congratulations.

01:03:22.005 --> 01:03:24.840
I wish i had something more
interesting to say.
It seems like we are making a

01:03:24.974 --> 01:03:33.782
Lot of comments tonight, which
is cool.
It's all good.

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:36.118
>> and his wife is holding
babies there
>> carson: She is sleeping.

01:03:36.252 --> 01:03:38.754

Anyway, it was great.

01:03:38.888 --> 01:03:44.660
>> carson: Coach blake.
>> as we search for more
compliments for you, barrett,

01:03:44.794 --> 01:03:49.264
'cause i'm right there with
them, it's -- at this point,
it's -- but i will say this, the

01:03:49.399 --> 01:03:54.970
Thing that i appreciate about
you and that's a good example,
"silent night," man, everything

01:03:55.104 --> 01:03:59.875
That you perform, you put your
own spin on it.
So, there's nobody else out

01:04:00.009 --> 01:04:03.812
There like you, man and that's
probably the thing that's gonna
be the reason that you go on and

01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:08.617
You make it in country music
after this, 'cause there's
nobody else only the radio that

01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:12.955
Sounds anything like you, man.
Congratulations again, dude.
Great job.

01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:20.195

When we come back, jeffery
austin joins gwen for a li

01:04:41.484 --> 01:04:45.354
>> carson: Welcome back.
It is our live finale going on
tonight.

01:04:45.488 --> 01:04:48.457
From the first moment gwen heard
jeffery austin sing, she
recognized the passion in his

01:04:48.591 --> 01:04:51.860
Voice.
With gwen's encourage.Jeffery
became the artist he always knew

01:04:51.995 --> 01:04:57.666
He could be.
Tonight, a duet that's the right
fit for both of these incredible

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.236
Vocalists.
>> when we started, i turned
around, and here we are at the

01:05:01.371 --> 01:05:06.241
End, the two of us.
>> so happy that we made it this
far.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:10.912
I was having a very, like,
surreal moment being in this
room because i have been in this

01:05:11.047 --> 01:05:15.617
Studio for so many years.
Now we are going to do this
duet, "leather and lace," which

01:05:15.752 --> 01:05:20.522
Is crazy, i have never been in
the final, i never got to do
this part either.

01:05:20.656 --> 01:05:30.799
So this is my first time.
¶ love is forever face to face ¶
¶ my city or mountains, stay

01:05:30.933 --> 01:05:37.172
With me, stay ¶
>> i could sing every emotional
heartbreak song in the book for

01:05:37.306 --> 01:05:40.942
This show, but it's been so
therapeutic.
I want to thank you for pushing

01:05:41.077 --> 01:05:46.381
Me to open up, because i
wouldn't have unless you had.
>> i feel like my whole

01:05:46.516 --> 01:05:52.220
Existence, like, of music was
always about just being honest.
By doing that, you can get so

01:05:52.355 --> 01:05:58.827
Much back.
I just think this is, like, a
perfect lyrical song for both of

01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:02.931
Us and i feel like tone-wise it
is perfect for both of us as
well, which is rare, because

01:06:03.066 --> 01:06:06.301
Obviously, i sing way better
than you, because it is going to
be really hard for you to keep

01:06:06.436 --> 01:06:19.681
Up with me.
¶ i need you to love me, i need
you today ¶

01:06:19.816 --> 01:06:22.984
>> you sound so good on this.
Seriously, every round, i felt
like i have had to fight and

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:29.391
Improve myself and i know that
you have been fighting for me
and believing in me.

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:33.061
You have got me here.
>> you got you here.
Just doing all the work, which

01:06:33.196 --> 01:06:35.764
Is so fun to watch.
You are so talented.
So cool.

01:06:35.898 --> 01:06:47.375
>> well, thank you.
>> such a good song.
You guys are good song writers,

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:51.680
Don henley and stevie nicks.
>> very good.

01:15:21.056 --> 01:15:25.293
The proper way, maybe go to a
label that really understands
everything that you need and

01:15:25.427 --> 01:15:30.331
Everything that these people
have come to -- to fall in love
with out of you, you know, not

01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:34.736
Becoming something else, not
chart chasing, just jordan
smith.

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:38.539
That's what they want.

One thing i want to tell you
guys is little story, this song

01:15:55.924 --> 01:15:59.894
Which i had never heard before
in my life, which is so
beautiful, is -- was a

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:03.064
Last-minute change, it was not
my idea, it was his idea, i had
another idea.

01:16:03.198 --> 01:16:08.736
Now hold on.
I don't have much time.
Please, stop it.

01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:11.539
Was a last-minute change and
that just shows you that
something different about this

01:16:11.674 --> 01:16:17.979
Guy, this guy is an artist, he
has a vision and i let it go
because it's his career, it's

01:16:18.113 --> 01:16:22.216
His world and i'm so happy that
i did, 'cause mine wouldn't have
been the right choice.

01:16:22.351 --> 01:16:27.622
His was the right choice and i'm
so overjoyed that you made it
and i applaud you.
