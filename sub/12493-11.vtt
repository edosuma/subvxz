00:04.875 --> 00:06.375
Guys, great news--

00:06.458 --> 00:08.333
I figured out where
I want to have my birthday party.

00:08.417 --> 00:11.208
Your birthday party?
Your birthday was six months ago.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.542
Yeah, but my party was canceled
because I got sick, remember?

00:14.625 --> 00:17.041
And then it was canceled
because I was bad.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.917
Then it was too close to Christmas

00:19.000 --> 00:21.083
and then I was bad again.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.834
Huh. I guess we never did have
a party for him.

00:24.917 --> 00:27.250
Well, I suppose we could have one
for him now.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.709
I mean, we do love him
as much as the other kids, right?

00:30.583 --> 00:34.208
Uh, well...

00:34.291 --> 00:36.458
The party's gonna be at the Boom Zone.
Here, take a look.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.875
Boom Zone?

00:37.959 --> 00:39.667
Yeah, it's totally fun

00:39.750 --> 00:40.917
and it's the perfect party place

00:41.000 --> 00:42.625
for me and ten of my closest friends,

00:43.041 --> 00:46.000
or as I like to call them, gift bringers.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.250
Wow.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.083
That's gonna run us some money.

00:50.834 --> 00:53.542
I mean, maybe if it were one
of the other kids I could see it.

00:54.417 --> 00:57.000
- Gabe, we'll do it...
- Yes! Now you're talking.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.375
- ...on one condition.
- Oh, and you're still talking.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.667
You can have your party at the Boom Zone

01:01.750 --> 01:03.875
if you can be good for a whole week.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.500
- I can do that.
- Amy: Hmm.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.250
Can't be mean to your brother or sisters.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.792
- No problem.
- Can't make fun of my cooking.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.542
Harder, but I can do that.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.208
And you can't make fun
of your father's weight.

01:16.291 --> 01:20.917
Oh-ho! Bye-bye, boom zone!

01:21.500 --> 01:24.333
No, Dad. Dad, you're wrong. I can do this.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.166
For the next week,
I will not say anything about your weight.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.792
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.166
- Good luck with that.
- Thanks, baldy.

- No, no, you tell her.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.333
Somebody!

02:36.959 --> 02:39.083
Okay, so Derek said the deepest thing.

02:39.583 --> 02:40.917
- Tell her, sweetie.
- Well...

02:41.333 --> 02:44.000
I was looking at my cereal this morning

02:44.083 --> 02:49.125
and I was thinking,
"Wow, no two flakes are exactly alike."

02:53.667 --> 02:57.125
That's snowflakes, not cornflakes.

02:58.041 --> 03:00.000
I actually wrote a poem about it.

03:00.083 --> 03:03.000
If you wanna hear it,
I'll be reading it at my next poetry slam.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.083
- We'll be there.
- Um, actually,

03:05.166 --> 03:08.166
I got another slam to go to that night.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.166
Derek didn't say what night it was.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.250
I got slams all week.

03:12.417 --> 03:13.750
I'm just slammed.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.458
- We'll be there.
- Derek: Cool.

03:16.542 --> 03:17.750
I gotta go.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.250
You know, babe, and read something,

03:21.333 --> 03:24.291
- that would be awesome.
- Okay.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.583
Cool. The theme of the night is pain.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.959
Okay.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.834
- See ya.
- Okay.

03:33.250 --> 03:36.583
You're gonna write a poem

03:36.667 --> 03:39.750
about pain then get up and read it?

03:39.834 --> 03:42.208
I don't think so.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.458
You just said you would.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.083
- I did?
- Yes.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.166
- When he put his arm on your shoulder.
- Oh, darn.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.333
Whenever he does that
I can't think straight.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.542
Uh-huh.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.500
So did you really like that thing
he said about cereal?

03:57.583 --> 03:58.959
What did he say about cereal?

04:08.417 --> 04:11.792
Hey, honey, these pants are too tight.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.333
Where are the new bigger ones I bought?

04:13.375 --> 04:14.917
Those are the new bigger ones.

04:17.667 --> 04:20.750
I'm leaving.
This is not a safe environment for me.

04:22.542 --> 04:23.875
Pants aren't so tight.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.542
I can make this work.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.750
Okay, Bob, honey,

04:32.834 --> 04:34.417
I love you to pieces, my dear,

04:34.500 --> 04:37.500
but your waistline has now become
a safety issue for the children.

04:38.542 --> 04:41.208
Honey, I would love to lose
a couple of pounds,

04:41.333 --> 04:42.917
but diets just don't seem to work for me.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.041
Well, dad, it's not just abo--

04:47.667 --> 04:49.917
Dad, it's not about dieting.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.208
What you need is healthier eating choices
combined with exercise.

04:53.291 --> 04:56.375
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Less bacon, more shakin'.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.000
I can help you out, be like your trainer.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.250
Okay.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.166
Thank you very much,
but I don't need your help.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.625
Yup, split the underwear too.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.792
Get started in the morning?

05:35.542 --> 05:37.208
Uh, Teddy, are you okay?

05:38.375 --> 05:41.166
No, my cereal's not speaking to me.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.709
Has your cereal spoken to you before?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.875
No, I just-- I need some inspiration.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.625
I told Derek that I'd read
an original poem on Saturday night

05:51.709 --> 05:53.125
and so far I've got nothing.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.208
Poetry you say?

05:55.291 --> 05:57.542
Have I ever mentioned that I write poetry?

05:59.041 --> 06:02.083
Mom, please don't make this about you.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.041
Of course, that would be selfish.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.458
Ooh! I wrote a great poem
about selfishness.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.875
- It goes like this: "Me, me, me, me..."
- Mom!

06:12.500 --> 06:14.125
Sorry. Um.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.625
Okay, what is your poem
supposed to be about?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.709
Well, it's supposed to be about pain,

06:18.792 --> 06:20.250
but I can't think about anything painful.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.208
I have happily-married parents,

06:22.250 --> 06:24.250
a roof over my head, food on my table.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.000
Why'd you guys have to give me
such a good life?

06:31.875 --> 06:34.000
Ah.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.417
- All right!
- Okay.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.125
- Let's go!
- Looking good, dad.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.542
For starters, thank you
for not wearing a tank top.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.041
All right, what do we do first?

06:43.125 --> 06:46.125
We... sambacise.

06:46.709 --> 06:49.709
- What is this?
- This is a celebrity workout program

06:49.792 --> 06:52.583
which combines exercise
with samba dancing.

06:52.667 --> 06:56.208
Oh, I don't know. This isn't gonna
make me look stupid, is it?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.250
Well, that's a big yes.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.333
Come on, dad, just give it a chance.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.709
Look how much fun Betty white's having.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.709
Wow, that woman is everywhere.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.542
- Just follow me.
- Uh-huh.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.041
- To the side.
- Whoa!

07:11.125 --> 07:14.208
- Yeah, and watch this part-- wha!
- Oh! Look at that!

07:14.750 --> 07:16.542
Yeah, keep going, Dad.
There you go, there you go.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.000
Hey, wait a minute. Betty's got a Rose.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.875
Well, way ahead of you, Dad.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.750
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.166
All right, here we go.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.458
Yeah!

07:28.542 --> 07:29.834
Ain't bad.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.125
Anything on your mind?

07:39.375 --> 07:41.166
I can make fun of this, right?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.667
I mean, this doesn't have anything
to do with your weight.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.041
Oh, yes it does.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.875
I'm doing this to lose weight.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.125
Big finish.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.333
Ah!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.208
"Deep, gut-wrenching pain,

08:06.291 --> 08:09.583
like an animal devouring me
from the inside out

08:09.667 --> 08:11.041
I cried in agony

08:11.542 --> 08:13.625
then gave into the beast."

08:24.500 --> 08:26.667
Thank you. That was called "Cereal."

08:28.917 --> 08:31.917
- Okay, you're up.
- Okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.875
Okay.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.375
Hello. Hello.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.667
Hi.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.917
Um, I'm Teddy Duncan

08:40.000 --> 08:42.917
and this is called "Nosebleed."

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
"Blood, blood, watch it flow,

08:50.083 --> 08:52.041
from my nose it did go,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.375
I was a screamer, I was a crier,

08:57.417 --> 09:00.750
the doctor called for a humidifier,

09:03.500 --> 09:06.375
we tried ice, we tried cotton,

09:07.583 --> 09:09.875
I put my head way back...

09:12.208 --> 09:13.709
Nuttin'."

09:22.250 --> 09:23.542
Thank you.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.000
Was it really as bad as I thought?

09:30.083 --> 09:31.250
No.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.083
No, no, it was...

09:33.750 --> 09:35.875
It wa-- oh, uh,

09:37.458 --> 09:39.792
- I gotta take this.
- Teddy: Oh.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.000
Hello.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.834
Okay, fake phone call.
Was it really that bad?

09:47.917 --> 09:50.375
Hang on. Hello?

09:50.917 --> 09:52.542
Hey! Stop that.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.500
I can't believe I just made
a complete fool of myself

09:56.583 --> 09:57.625
in front of Derek.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.834
So? Who cares what Derek thinks?

09:59.917 --> 10:01.542
I do. He's my boyfriend.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.625
Look, he's fine for now,

10:04.709 --> 10:07.583
but he isn't exactly a keeper, right?

10:07.667 --> 10:10.709
- What do you mean?
- Come on. You guys are so different.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.125
Well, different? How are we different?

10:12.208 --> 10:14.125
You're smart. He's Derek.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.458
You're fun. He's Derek.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.250
You're interesting. He's Derek.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.375
So you don't like Derek?

10:20.458 --> 10:23.291
Okay. Well, maybe
I don't like your boyfriend.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.667
And what is wrong with my Ray-ray?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.792
Well, the fact that
you call him Ray-ray for starters.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.458
"Ray-ray said this. Ray-ray said that."

10:32.542 --> 10:33.959
Sometimes I just pray-pray

10:34.041 --> 10:35.625
you'll shut up about Ray-ray.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.375
Well, your prayers
have just been answered,

10:38.458 --> 10:39.875
because I'm never talking to you again.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.500
Well, that-- that's right!

10:42.625 --> 10:45.667
Go run-run away-way to Ray-ray!

10:48.792 --> 10:50.500
Look, no, it's not a poem.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.041
But you liked it?

11:00.750 --> 11:03.250
Whoa, it is really coming down out there.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.583
Well, mom, it wasn't easy,

11:06.667 --> 11:08.375
but I've been good for an entire week.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.250
Boom Zone, here I come!

11:10.333 --> 11:13.000
I have to say, Gabe,
you have really earned this party.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.959
Hmm. Here you go.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.583
- What's this?
- It's a list of bad things

11:17.667 --> 11:19.750
I thought of saying but didn't.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.625
Part one is fat jokes about dad.

11:21.709 --> 11:23.834
Gabe, there's nothing funny about--

11:23.917 --> 11:25.667
That one's pretty good.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.166
I like that one.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.792
Oh, that one's even better.

11:29.875 --> 11:32.083
Gabe: That one--

11:33.500 --> 11:35.417
What? What's so funny?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Nothing.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.500
Bob: Ooh! Cake.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.166
"Dear dad, be strong.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.333
Do not eat this cake.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.125
Love, your son and trainer PJ."

12:07.583 --> 12:11.041
"Dear dad,
so you've thrown away my first note.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.542
Here is a second chance
to make the right decision.

12:14.625 --> 12:18.542
Your son who believes in you, PJ."

12:36.500 --> 12:37.583
"Dear dad,

12:38.166 --> 12:41.250
okay, so notes aren't your thing."

12:47.166 --> 12:50.709
- Hi, Mrs. Wentz.
- Hey. Goodness, Teddy, get in here.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.333
Oh, wow, it's really snowing out there.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.333
I could barely park in your driveway.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.041
We don't have a driveway.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.792
Okay. Well, I know where it could go.

13:02.625 --> 13:03.917
Can I talk to Ivy?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.542
We got in a fight last night
and I really need to apologize.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.208
Oh, I'm sorry, Teddy. Ivy's not here.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.875
She went to your house because
she said she needed to apologize to you.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.792
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.458
Okay, well, I-- I'd better go home then.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.250
Oh, no, Teddy, you're not going anywhere.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.375
Hi, Mr. Wentz.

13:23.375 --> 13:26.041
- Come on, take a look at this
- Okay.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.250
Now as you can see,

13:28.333 --> 13:31.625
we've got a high-pressure system
stalled over the Rockies,

13:31.709 --> 13:34.625
and it's pushing cold arctic air
down from Canada

13:34.709 --> 13:36.667
giving us a freak spring blizzard.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.166
- Oh.
- Harry always wanted to be a weatherman,

13:40.250 --> 13:41.917
but he answered the call
of plumbing supplies.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.458
- Mmm.
- Uh-oh, breaking news:

13:44.542 --> 13:45.959
They've just closed all the roads,

13:46.041 --> 13:48.333
and that means that you, young lady,

13:48.417 --> 13:51.000
are gonna be staying right here,
maybe overnight.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.875
What? I'm sorry, I can't stay overnight.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.750
I'd like to also send a shout out
to Abner Johnson.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.166
He's 104 today.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.500
Who is he talking to?

14:02.583 --> 14:04.917
- Nobody. Harry...
- Harry: Mmm?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.625
...you do know that
you're not really on TV, right?

14:07.709 --> 14:10.875
Of course, I do. Back to you, Mary Lou.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.583
Man on TV: We're expecting
up to two feet of snow today,

14:21.667 --> 14:24.125
so stay in your homes and off the roads.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.458
Ivy? Get in here.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.625
What are you doing here?

14:34.709 --> 14:37.000
I came over to apologize to Teddy.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.875
Teddy went to your house
to apologize to you.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.667
- What?
- And now the roads are all closed,

14:41.750 --> 14:45.000
- so you're gonna be stuck here awhile.
- Really? You mean overnight?

14:45.083 --> 14:46.250
Even maybe a few days?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.709
- Yes!
- Ah. Let's go, people.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.375
We've got a party to go to.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.583
Gabe, honey, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.125
Just tell me on the way to the Boom Zone.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.333
No, no. Come sit with mama, okay?

14:58.417 --> 15:01.208
Okay. Hey.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.667
Now, sweetie, because of the blizzard,

15:03.750 --> 15:06.542
nobody's able to drive anywhere and...

15:06.625 --> 15:08.166
I'm afraid your party is off.

15:08.959 --> 15:11.417
What? Again?

15:11.500 --> 15:14.208
- No, no, take a deep breath.
- I can't believe this!

15:14.291 --> 15:16.166
I've been keeping my mouth shut
for nothing?

15:16.250 --> 15:18.333
- Okay, Gabe, just calm--
- Save it, tubby!

15:18.375 --> 15:21.333
- Amy: Hey, Gabe!
- Your cooking stinks! And you're stupid!

15:21.375 --> 15:22.875
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, but you were thinking

15:22.959 --> 15:24.417
something stupid.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.375
I hate my life!

15:27.458 --> 15:31.500
Man. This is so much better than my house.

15:35.792 --> 15:38.500
You see, Teddy, most people actually think

15:38.625 --> 15:40.208
that when the temperature rises,

15:40.291 --> 15:42.417
so does the barometric pressure...

15:42.500 --> 15:44.125
But that is not the case.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.834
Harry, leave that girl alone.

15:48.917 --> 15:52.166
Let's do something
Teddy would enjoy, like...

15:53.041 --> 15:54.875
A Jigsaw puzzle.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.792
Oh!

16:05.792 --> 16:08.208
- Gabe, are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.542
Look, babe, I know how you feel.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.083
No, you don't.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.542
You've never gone
without a party on your birthday.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.166
You've had like a million of them.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.542
Okay, I'm gonna let that one go,

16:26.625 --> 16:28.500
because I know you're hurting right now.

16:28.583 --> 16:33.083
But I promise you,
You are going to have a birthday party.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.417
Yeah, when I'm 100

16:34.500 --> 16:36.458
and I can't even blow out my candles?

16:36.542 --> 16:38.542
Okay, if you're referring to grandpa,

16:38.625 --> 16:40.834
he's only 70 and he has asthma.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.709
Teddy, you've hardly touched
your liver and onions.

16:53.792 --> 16:54.667
Mmm.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.250
I had liver for breakfast.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.375
Got any requests?

17:01.458 --> 17:02.917
How about a snowmobile?

17:03.667 --> 17:05.333
How about "Row, row, row your boat"?

17:05.417 --> 17:06.750
It's my favorite. Come on.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.291
Actually, Mr. Wentz,
you really don't have to--

17:09.375 --> 17:12.709
♪ Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream ♪

17:12.792 --> 17:15.917
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream. ♪

17:16.000 --> 17:18.208
We can't do this when Ivy's home.
She won't let us.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.834
Ha. I miss her so much.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.333
Rounds!

17:23.375 --> 17:25.375

17:25.500 --> 17:27.125

17:27.208 --> 17:30.125
♪ Row, row, row your boat

17:34.709 --> 17:37.000
Whatever this is,
I'm sure it's gonna be lame.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.792
Oh, I don't think so. Hit it, Charlie.

17:39.875 --> 17:43.041
Surprise!

17:43.125 --> 17:45.834
All: Happy birthday!

17:47.500 --> 17:49.959
- What's all this?
- "What's all this?"

17:50.041 --> 17:51.542
It's the Duncan Fun Zone!

17:51.625 --> 17:53.834
Well, since we can't go to your party,

17:53.917 --> 17:55.917
we brought the party to you.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.250
Look out below!

18:02.875 --> 18:04.792
- Bob: Oh!
- Gabe: Oh!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.750
Oh!

18:06.834 --> 18:08.041
You want a turn?

18:08.166 --> 18:09.375
You look kinda sick.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.583
- Yeah.
- Of course, I want a turn!

18:11.667 --> 18:14.000
All right!

18:15.375 --> 18:18.625
♪ Row, row, row your boat

18:18.709 --> 18:20.625

Wait, wait. Guys, guys,
does this song have an ending?

18:22.792 --> 18:24.417
If it does, we've never found it.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.709
Now...

18:26.792 --> 18:28.834
In German!

18:28.917 --> 18:29.917

20:07.792 --> 20:09.041
Thanks, everybody.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.583
This really has been the best party ever.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.959
Look, I'm sorry I called you fat,

20:15.041 --> 20:16.792
stupid and a bad cook.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.750
I mean, even though you are fat,
stupid and a bad cook...

20:22.458 --> 20:24.667
I love you all.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.583
Well, we love you too.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.875
Not as much as the others, of course.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.291
But...

20:34.542 --> 20:36.625
- Teddy!
- Hey, everybody.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.166
- Bob: Hey!
- Ivy: Oh, hey.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.041
What are you doing here?
The roads are all closed.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.792
- Yeah, I walked.
- Why did you do that?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.291
I think I can answer that.

20:45.792 --> 20:46.917
- Liver and onions?
- Teddy: Yup.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.041
- Jigsaw puzzle?
- Uh-huh.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.083
- "Row, row, row your boat"?
- In German.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.625
- Come here.
- Okay.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.333
Well, Charlie, the storm's over,

20:59.417 --> 21:02.750
sun's shining, Gabe had a great party

21:02.834 --> 21:04.333
and, ooh, best of all,

21:04.417 --> 21:07.834
thanks to sambacising,
dad's lost two pounds.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.709
Yeah, he was so excited,
he's now graduated to...

21:10.792 --> 21:12.500
Both: Tangocise!

21:23.041 --> 21:24.291
Oh!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.917
Ay-yi-yi.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.709
Good luck, Charlie.

21:44.083 --> 21:44.959
Huh.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.458
Finally, we are alone.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.750
- Nuh-uh-uh.
- Whoa-ho-ho!

21:55.792 --> 21:57.375
How did you--

21:57.458 --> 21:59.667
but it was-- but, how, how did you--

21:59.750 --> 22:02.041
now grab an apple and go back to bed.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.542
- You're just a head, right?
- Yes.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.250
- No arms, no legs?
- Nope.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.250
- Got eyes though, right?
- Of course.

22:11.375 --> 22:14.500
- Well, then you can
- PJ: No. No, no.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.625
- No, no, no!
- Mmm!

22:18.041 --> 22:19.375
Now I'm wishing I didn't have eyes.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.333
- Wishing you had teeth? Oh!
- No.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.125
Mmm!
