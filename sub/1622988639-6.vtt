[tense music]

00:08.216 --> 00:09.217
[Brie sighs]

00:09.884 --> 00:11.219
I'm fine, Mel.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.639
You have really low blood pressure.
Are you okay?

00:14.723 --> 00:15.849
[Brie groans]

00:17.851 --> 00:19.019
[Brie retches]

00:21.646 --> 00:22.897
What do you think happened?

00:22.981 --> 00:24.733
[sighs] I don't know.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.240
What the hell is alprazolam?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.035
-[toilet flushes]
-That's Xanax.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.245
[latch clicks]

00:38.705 --> 00:42.000
Mel, thanks for everything.
I just really need to sleep.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.461
Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll let you rest.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.721
-If you need anything, we're downstairs.
-[Brie] Mm.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.977
[quietly] Why is she taking Xanax?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.855
It's usually prescribed for anxiety.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.691
Yeah, I know,
but she doesn't even like taking aspirin.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.277
I don't know.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.280
We were all a mess when you were shot.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.451
[Jack] Did she take too much?

01:17.660 --> 01:20.163
I think she might have
mixed it with alcohol.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.832
I saw an empty wine glass in her room.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.251
I feel like this is my fault.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.920
No, this isn't your fault.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.005
What do you think I should do?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.633
Well, I think you should
let her rest for tonight

01:31.716 --> 01:33.927
and try to talk to her about it tomorrow.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.347
[Mel] It's okay.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.266
She's gonna be fine.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.479
If you need anything, I'm here, okay?

01:45.396 --> 01:46.606
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.275
[theme music playing]

01:59.077 --> 02:00.453
[knocking at door]

02:01.454 --> 02:03.123
[loud knocking]

02:04.124 --> 02:06.292

-[Doc] Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.712
-[rapid knocking]
-Hold your horses. I'm coming!

02:09.796 --> 02:11.548
-[knocking continues]
-Jeez!

02:12.298 --> 02:14.884
-[loud knocking]
-What-- All right, all right!

02:14.968 --> 02:16.386
-Excuse me.
-[Doc] Wha--

02:16.469 --> 02:18.388
Sorry about the knocking.
I told her to chill.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.430
Don't worry about it.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.101
We are in the middle of a crisis.
We should all be worried.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.978
What is going on here?

02:25.061 --> 02:27.105
[sighs] Carol Foreman has a migraine.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.357
Okay. Does she need me
to make a house call?

02:29.440 --> 02:33.319
No, no, but she is president of the
Lumberjack Games committee, remember?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.113
Why is that pertinent information?

02:35.196 --> 02:37.907
[Jo Ellen] Because she can't
run the games in her condition,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.576
so we have to fill in for her.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.244
[Doc] Oh no, no. We-- No, no.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.872
I told Hope
I am not equipped to work the games.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.916
But if we don't help out,
it will be an absolute disaster.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.337
Now, your job will be
to make sure that the events run smoothly.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.007
I'd do it, but I'm working the entrance.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.635
Well, how am I gonna oversee
multiple games all by myself?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.221
You're not! I am giving you an assistant.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.682
FYI, I have no idea
what she's talking about.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.850
That makes two of us.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.644
Muriel has agreed
to emcee the competitions,

03:06.728 --> 03:08.855
Jack and Preacher are slotted
to work the food,

03:08.938 --> 03:10.940
and Connie's setting up a bakery tent.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.358
So it's like a fair?

03:12.442 --> 03:15.778
It's more like
the Olympics for lumberjacks.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.779
Why is that a thing?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.908
Well, it's an annual tribute
at the top of Shelter Mountain

03:19.991 --> 03:24.287
to honor the frontiersmen and women
who founded Virgin River. It is a hoot.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.623
Jo Ellen said
I need to dress like a lumberjack.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.917
-[Doc] Everyone does.
-Why?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.045
Well, first, it's festive,
and second, it's cold as hell up there.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.590
Anyway, um,
here is everything that you need.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.343
The event schedule,
volunteer worker shifts,

-[Jo Ellen] Oh.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.559
[sighs] Oh! It's Nick! Sorry.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.518
What about us?

03:48.102 --> 03:49.437
I'll be just a second!

03:49.520 --> 03:51.814
Well, have you looked
in the bottom drawer?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.358
[sighs]

03:54.025 --> 03:56.653
I know how I got here.
How'd you get roped into this mess?

03:56.736 --> 03:59.864
She let me stay at the B&B last night
and wouldn't let me pay her,

03:59.948 --> 04:01.574
so I felt like I owed her one.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.951
Oh, I see, I see.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.036
Well, when Hope gets back,

04:05.119 --> 04:07.580
she's gonna owe me
a heck of a lot more than one.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.218
-[Mel] Hey!
-Oh, hey!

04:21.261 --> 04:22.470
What you doing?

04:22.553 --> 04:23.888
Uh,

04:23.972 --> 04:27.183
just help setting up
the axe-throwing targets.

04:27.767 --> 04:28.935
I brought you a coffee.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.019
-Thanks.
-Hm.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.690
What? What are you looking at? [laughs]

04:33.773 --> 04:37.402
Do you have any idea how gorgeous you are?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.570
-Did you hit your head already?
-Nope!

04:39.654 --> 04:41.739
'Cause I got my trauma kit right here.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.325
Oh no, I'm right as rain. Thank you.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.537
How much first aid do you plan on giving?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.914
Well, considering
I have never attended an event

04:49.998 --> 04:54.752
with chainsaws, guns,
and axe-throwing, I'm not entirely sure.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.337
Okay, fair enough.

04:57.463 --> 05:01.926
Look, I know I already said yes to this,
but, um, what exactly is a tree race?

05:03.469 --> 05:06.681
Well, actually, it's a treetop race.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.391
-Ah!
-Thanks.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.477
Um,
I still don't know what that means, so…

05:11.561 --> 05:14.188
Mm.
You kinda have to see it to understand it.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.648
Mm-hmm.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.860
-And the "Jack and Jill"?
-Oh, we tandem-saw through a tree trunk.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.194
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.

-Oh my God! [laughs]

05:23.781 --> 05:25.116
Oh, wow, all right.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.951
Well, full disclosure,

05:27.035 --> 05:30.288
I… I don't like heights,
and I've never touched a saw.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.041
Ah, you're gonna do great.
Don't you worry.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.250
[Mel] Okay.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.337
-Don't say I didn't warn you!
-Don't you worry.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.091
Um, have you seen Brie this morning?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.552
-No, not yet.
-Hm.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.513
-She texted, said she'd be here later.
-Uh-huh.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.101
I knew something was up with her too.
I feel like I should've pushed harder.

05:52.185 --> 05:57.023
No. Sometimes, people aren't ready
to talk about their feelings, you know?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.317
Still…

06:00.610 --> 06:03.279
-Beating yourself up isn't gonna help her.
-Jack! Jack!

06:03.363 --> 06:05.156
-Can we talk about it later?
-Yeah.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.324

-Todd's allergic.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.584
but his allergies
are keeping him up at night,

and if he can't sleep,

11:10.461 --> 11:11.462
he can't work.

Well, if it's allergies,
tell him to go see Mel or Doc.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.508
He doesn't have time

11:15.591 --> 11:18.636
to take shots, and the
over-the-counter stuff makes him drowsy.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.429
Well, that would fix his insomnia.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.847
[sighs] Jack,

11:21.931 --> 11:24.350
don't make this difficult, okay?

11:24.433 --> 11:27.603
I have asked everyone that I know,
and nobody can take Tucker.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.315
And if I can't find a home for him
in the next few days…

11:32.942 --> 11:35.111
All right. I'll take him.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.195
You will?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.447
Oh my God! Thank you so much!

11:38.531 --> 11:41.325
Um, we'll be over
as soon as Todd's out of his meeting.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.576
Thank you.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.619
Okay.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.045
[Jack] Oh, look who shows up
after all the work is finished.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.588
Yeah, I was working too.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.009
-Fishing is not work, buddy.
-[Mike] I'm talking about your case.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.306
Brady doesn't have an alibi
for the night of the shooting.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.016
What? Bea said he was at her bar.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.436
Well, when I started
re-interviewing witnesses,

12:08.519 --> 12:10.104
she changed her story.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.441
There's now two hours
that Brady's unaccounted for.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.735
You think Bea was lying?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.904
No, I think she just made
an honest mistake.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.743
Brady's our primary suspect now.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.286
Nah, come on.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.707
I mean, we had our differences, but…

12:31.125 --> 12:32.001
We were brothers.

12:32.668 --> 12:37.882
Yeah, but, I mean, you know
as well as I do, Iraq changed all of us.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.550
Yeah, but still, I mean…

12:41.427 --> 12:42.803
I… I just don't see it.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.015
[Mike] I can't rule anyone out.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.100
Gotta go where the case leads me.

12:55.441 --> 12:59.612
Okay, so the next time
you work with chainsaws,

12:59.695 --> 13:02.782
might I suggest putting on some pants?

13:02.865 --> 13:04.158
[Mel] You're good to go.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.659
-[man] Thank you.
-[Mel] Yeah.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.371
[chuckles]

13:09.455 --> 13:11.248
Hey, you came!

13:11.332 --> 13:14.585
Yeah, but I, uh,
missed the dress code memo.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.004
Ah, well, you know,
they're selling fake beards

13:17.087 --> 13:18.672
over at the log-rolling tent, so…

13:18.756 --> 13:20.758
[laughs]

13:20.841 --> 13:22.051
I'm really glad you came.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.595
Yeah, I promised Jack I'd help out.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.557
Yeah? I promised Jack that I would
saw through a tree trunk with him.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.101
You really must love my brother.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.311
I do.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.480
[Brie chuckles, sighs]

13:34.563 --> 13:36.273
I am starving.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.108
What is good around here?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.276
Um…

13:40.361 --> 13:43.948
Ooh, we could raid the bakery tent.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.366
I am in.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.034
Ah yes!

13:48.911 --> 13:49.745
Okay.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.540
By the way, I am sorry about last night.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.959
Oh my gosh, no. I'm just glad I was there.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.586
I think I just ate something
that didn't agree with me.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.298
Brie, um…

14:02.633 --> 14:04.927
[hesitates] …I saw the Xanax.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.140
-You went through my purse?
-No, I-- No, I didn't.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.059
You knocked it over, and then…

14:13.811 --> 14:15.062
Jack picked them up.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.231
So Jack knows.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.149
-Yes.
-[sarcastically] Great.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.068
[Brie scoffs]

14:21.610 --> 14:22.862
How much are you taking?

14:24.655 --> 14:27.283
I mean, one isn't enough for me.

14:29.743 --> 14:34.707
Okay, well, did you mix them with wine?
'Cause I saw an empty glass.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.753
[sighs] It's just that sometimes
I need them to work faster.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.506
It was a mistake.
Definitely won't happen again.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.385
Okay. Well, both Xanax and alcohol

14:46.468 --> 14:49.430
depress central nervous system functions
like breathing, so…

14:50.472 --> 14:52.182
You know, they can be fatal.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.853
Yeah, I was just, uh…

14:57.104 --> 14:58.981
I was just having such a bad day.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.275
Look, I get it.

15:02.443 --> 15:06.196
You know, after Jack was shot, I…
I had some bad days.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.865
And, um… [clears throat]

15:10.117 --> 15:12.536
…I started taking the Xanax
before the shooting.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.289
Oh.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.043
Do you wanna tell me what's going on?

15:21.420 --> 15:25.966
I was, uh, dating this guy in Sacramento.
He was an attorney.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.511
And it ended badly.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.722
Really badly.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.100
[Brie] So, I quit my job.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.186
[quietly] Oh.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.439
-Did you work with him?
-Uh, no, no, I just…

15:40.522 --> 15:44.026
I couldn't stand the idea
of seeing him in court. [laughs awkwardly]

15:44.860 --> 15:46.695
-[Mel sighs]
-[Brie sniffles]

15:46.779 --> 15:48.447
-I'm really sorry.
-Hm.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.370
You know, you should talk to Jack.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.580
He's really worried about you.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.457
[sighs] Yeah, I don't know.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.211
We're not as close as we used to be.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.089
Yeah, I… I get it.

16:05.172 --> 16:08.634
But you know what? You're both here now,
so maybe you can change that.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.596
Hm. [inhales deeply]

16:12.680 --> 16:13.597
[Brie] Yeah.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.518
They have really good,
um, cinnamon swirls.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.937
-I'm gonna need two of them, so…
-Okay.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.567
[applause and cheering]

16:32.157 --> 16:36.578
Probably isn't the best time to ask this,
but, uh, are you still pissed at me?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.122
Why don't I take these?

16:40.249 --> 16:44.169
Whatever, Ricky. If you don't wanna
live together, I'll figure something out.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.587
I have options.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.423
I just don't think we're ready.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.340
Why not?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.718
'Cause we haven't been
going out that long.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.594
We're still getting to know each other.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.304
Well enough to have sex.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.391
Having sex doesn't mean we'll
spend the rest of our lives together.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.185
-Neither does living together.
-Yeah, it's pretty close.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.816
Hey, uh, can we talk about this later?

17:05.899 --> 17:07.818
Why? There's nothing else to talk about.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.112
[Jeb] Lizzie, can you help me?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.489
Yeah, I think Jeb needs you.
Can we catch up later?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.370
Hey.

Thanks.

you'd give that lady a ring

-Bend your knees!

19:01.098 --> 19:03.433
Strength comes from your legs,
not your arms.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.519

19:18.240 --> 19:20.159
Hey, did you get a chance to talk to Brie?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.537
Uh, you know,
I think she's gonna talk to you.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.707
I think she's avoiding me.
I just wanna know what's going on.

19:28.625 --> 19:33.213
She said she had a bad breakup with some
attorney in Sacramento a few months ago.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.716
I didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.386
Oh my gosh.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.054
This is so hard.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.141
I thought I was in shape until now.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.643
You're still the hottest Jill here.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.230
-I see what you're doing.
-What?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.733
You think compliments
are gonna keep me going?

19:52.816 --> 19:55.611
Yeah, I'm hoping so.
This team requires two people.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.196

That's my girl! Come on.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.617
[Mel groans]

20:03.368 --> 20:06.830
So Brie really quit her job
over a boyfriend?

20:06.914 --> 20:11.084
You know, you really should
talk to her about it, but yes.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.463
[sighs] She said
she didn't wanna see him in court.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.883
It's hard to believe
she got this twisted up over a guy.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.969
[grunts] I think she was in love with him.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.596
[Jack] You don't know my sister.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.515
She doesn't let anything
get in the way of her career. Ever.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.269
For some people, when they get older,
their priorities change.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.314
What do you mean by that?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.482
[sighs]

20:34.399 --> 20:37.694
I just think every--
You know, love is different for everyone.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.491
Sometimes when things get serious,
people wanna pull back.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.702
Why do I feel like that was aimed at me?

20:46.286 --> 20:47.120
It wasn't.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.582
Well, I can get close to people.
I mean, look at us!

20:50.666 --> 20:52.209
Yeah, but--

20:53.335 --> 20:55.629
-Well-- [sighs]
-[Jack] What?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.048
[quietly] Oh God.

20:58.131 --> 21:02.636

21:21.446 --> 21:24.783
I don't think the Lumberjack Games
is the place to have this conversation.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.326
I wasn't trying to.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.829
Hey, guys, have you seen Christopher?

21:28.912 --> 21:29.746
[Mel] No.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.417
He was at the Hot Saw warm-up
when we left. Said he was waiting for you.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.668
Yeah, no, he's not there.

21:35.168 --> 21:36.586
Don't worry. We'll find him.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.592
Doc.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.097
Doc, you're gonna be late.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.516
Oh, no, the canoe race
doesn't start for an hour,

21:49.599 --> 21:51.476
and these vests will all be done by then.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.313
I'm talking about
the trap shooting competition.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.607
Oh. Oh no.
I told Hope I'm not shooting this year.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.985
[Jo Ellen] You're on the list.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.779
-Well, just go ahead and scratch me off.
-[Jo Ellen scoffs]

22:03.822 --> 22:06.158
Including you,
there's only three people signed up,

22:06.241 --> 22:10.245
so if you don't participate,
it's hardly an event. It would--

22:10.329 --> 22:13.457
Well, I don't think anyone's gonna care
whether I shoot or not.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.625
[sighs sadly]

22:16.877 --> 22:18.170
Jo Ellen, what's wrong?

22:18.253 --> 22:21.048
-I was just with Lilly and the girls.
-Oh.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.176
[cries] I can't believe she has cancer.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.679
I know. I know. I'm so sorry.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.973
[Doc] I know how close the two of you are.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.601
What are we supposed to do?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.978
I just can't wrap my head around it.

22:35.062 --> 22:39.191
What are we supposed to do?
Just sit around and wait until…

22:39.858 --> 22:41.443
until she's gone?

22:43.236 --> 22:45.113
You know, when it comes to the end,

22:45.197 --> 22:48.825
none of us really know
what's gonna happen.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.413
So all we can do
is just go on living our lives.

If you spend all your time

that my enthusiasm is inspiring.

23:58.311 --> 24:01.022
And I am so excited
to watch you defend your title.

this is gonna be my year.

You are too kind, but look at the time.
I can't be late to my check-in.

24:12.617 --> 24:16.830
Okay. Well, you break a leg,
or in this case, a clay disc.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.290
[laughs] Will do!

24:19.416 --> 24:21.418

-Hey.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.594
-I didn't expect to see you here.
-Yeah, my kids wanted to come.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.971
-Oh.
-Spent a small fortune on Klondike Bars.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.974
Well, it's all for a good cause, you know?

24:36.558 --> 24:39.269
-Which is why we'll be back next year.
-[Doc chuckles]

24:39.352 --> 24:41.980
Glad to see you're not letting your AMD
hold you back.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.983
Actually, there was a mix-up,
and I didn't have much choice,

24:45.066 --> 24:49.613
but my chances of hitting anything
are 10% at best.

24:49.696 --> 24:52.699
Have you given any more thought
to the anti-VEGF therapy?

24:52.782 --> 24:55.160
Uh, Doc. You're on deck.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.995
Oh! Yeah.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.955
-Uh, we can talk later.
-Thanks.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.543
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

25:03.627 --> 25:07.255
It's just if I get behind schedule,
Jo Ellen will have a conniption.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.217
Oh, I get it, believe me. [laughs]

25:32.030 --> 25:33.323
Uh, no.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.617
-Keep an eye out, will you?
-Sure.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.748
[sighs] Hey, Jack, uh…

25:42.499 --> 25:45.585
Sorry about last night.
I'm just dealing with some stuff, so…

25:47.254 --> 25:48.421
I just wanna help you.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.298
Thanks, but I don't need help.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.260
Why are you pushing me away?

25:53.843 --> 25:55.679
I'm not. [scoffs]

25:55.762 --> 25:57.430
Okay, then talk to me.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.936
Come on. Hey!
Whatever it is, I can handle it, okay?

26:03.478 --> 26:04.479
It's personal.

26:05.814 --> 26:06.690
So what?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.317
So,

26:10.610 --> 26:11.695
before the shooting,

26:12.904 --> 26:14.698
when's the last time you called?

26:16.157 --> 26:19.786
What? So, you're keeping me in the dark
about your life

26:19.869 --> 26:21.496
because I didn't call you enough?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.915
No, but ever since you got back from Iraq,

26:23.999 --> 26:26.293
you have been
emotionally and physically MIA.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.045
Not just with me,
but with the entire family.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.506
Come on. I love you.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.674
Yeah, I love you too.

it feels like we're strangers.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.818

it's none of my business,

26:51.901 --> 26:54.154
but is there something going on
with you guys?

26:54.779 --> 26:56.323

that I am responsible for you?

I'd never forgive myself.

It's okay.
Just tell me you won't do it again.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.544
Wanna go for a ride?

35:29.627 --> 35:30.628
Where?

35:30.711 --> 35:36.384
Well, there's this cool little
Italian joint in Grace Valley.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.636
Isn't that, like, two hours away?

35:38.719 --> 35:39.679
Mm.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.516
Why? You got somewhere else you wanna be?

35:45.685 --> 35:47.520
[quietly] Not that I can think of.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.646
Good.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.691
Come on.

35:58.948 --> 35:59.782
[Charmaine] Jack.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.618
-Uh…
-Hey!

36:03.286 --> 36:04.203
Did you win?

36:04.787 --> 36:06.873
-[Jack] Not this year, no.
-Uh-huh.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.083
Where's Todd?

36:09.167 --> 36:13.671
He's having some beers
with some guys from the club, so…

36:13.754 --> 36:14.839
Here's Tucker.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.800
You know, Char--

36:17.884 --> 36:21.762
He, uh, in the mornings, likes to have
his tummy rubbed before breakfast,

36:21.846 --> 36:24.015
and he gets three walks a day,

36:24.098 --> 36:29.020
and he prefers to nap in the sunlight,
so, um--

36:29.103 --> 36:32.440
Here's his food and his toys.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.233
[sadly] His blankie.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.405
You really don't have to do this.

36:39.488 --> 36:43.409
Uh, yes, I do, actually.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.579
Todd's not allergic.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.622
He's, um…

36:49.040 --> 36:50.958
he's just not a dog person.

36:51.042 --> 36:56.881
I thought I could change his mind,
but obviously, I couldn't. So…

36:56.964 --> 36:59.759
So he's just making you
get rid of your dog, huh?

36:59.842 --> 37:03.012
He's not making me.
It's a sacrifice, Jack.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.348
Pretty crappy sacrifice, if you ask me.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.933
I wasn't asking you.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.854
Look, are you gonna take Tucker or not?

37:13.272 --> 37:14.148
Yes.

37:15.733 --> 37:16.817
[sighs] Okay.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.778
[sighs, sniffles]

37:20.154 --> 37:21.072
Thanks.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.699
-[Jack] Hey, buddy.
-Uh, I have to go.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.660
It'll be okay.

37:28.454 --> 37:29.330
[Mel] Hey!

37:31.165 --> 37:34.377
-How do you feel about dogs?
-Why are you asking me that?

37:34.460 --> 37:36.587
Todd doesn't wanna keep Tucker.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.089
-What?
-Yeah!

37:38.172 --> 37:40.925
Oh! It must've broken her heart
to give him up.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.011
I think she should give Todd away,
but that's just my opinion.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.347
And you are entitled to your opinion.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.100
Okay, buddy, here we go.

37:49.183 --> 37:52.603
You wait here.
It's okay, it's okay. Come here.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.732
Look, I'm sorry that we ended up
talking about our relationship

37:56.816 --> 37:58.442
in the middle of a sporting event.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.112
Not how I wanted the day to go.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.114
No, me neither. [sighs]

38:03.197 --> 38:04.365
I'm sorry too.

38:04.949 --> 38:05.908
[sighs]

38:07.285 --> 38:09.537
Brie said she told you about Mandy.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.080
Oh yeah. [chuckles awkwardly]

38:11.163 --> 38:13.833
Yeah. I just, uh,
I told her I wouldn't say anything.

38:14.417 --> 38:18.087
And I figured you would
end up telling me someday.

38:18.170 --> 38:21.215
Well, really, there's not much to tell.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.676
I mean, we got married
right out of high school.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.094
I joined the marines.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.513
She filed for divorce
when I shipped out to Iraq.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.808
The whole marriage
lasted less than three months.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.143
[Mel] Hm.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.312
Why didn't you just tell me before?

38:34.395 --> 38:37.231
Honestly, it's not something
I ever think about.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.149
[Mel] Huh.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.735
I'm sorry you found out the way you did.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.153
Yeah, um…

38:43.988 --> 38:46.449
It just makes me wonder
what else I don't know about.

38:46.532 --> 38:47.867
Like what?

38:47.950 --> 38:50.745
I don't know.
I just wanna be prepared for the future.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.371
[Jack] Yeah, I get it.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.958
But you told me to take some time
to think about the baby, so…

38:56.042 --> 38:59.420
[Mel] I know.
I know, and I'm sorry. I didn't--

38:59.962 --> 39:03.424
[sighs] I just didn't think
it was gonna be this hard to wait.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.761
You know, wherever we end up,
I just want you to be happy.

39:07.803 --> 39:10.056
I am happy. I wanna be with you.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.392
And I want a family.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.102
What about the twins?

39:16.771 --> 39:19.315
You know, if we got married,
you'd be their stepmother.

39:19.398 --> 39:20.358
I know.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.819
I know, and I would love them
with all of my heart.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.738
I would… [hesitates]

39:25.821 --> 39:29.492
But I know myself, and loving them
is not gonna stop this feeling that I have

39:29.575 --> 39:31.660
to have a baby of my own.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.164
-[Mel] I just want you to think about it.
-Yeah.

39:36.415 --> 39:39.460
I know, and I will. I am.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.045
Yeah.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.297
[Jack] Hey, I love you.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.925
I love you too.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.219
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh.

39:48.302 --> 39:52.473
-Can't you tell them you'll call back?
-No, I'm still on the clock. Sorry.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.683
All right, I'm gonna pack up.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.229
Hello.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.524
Okay, I'll be right there.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.694
There's an emergency at Lilly's.
