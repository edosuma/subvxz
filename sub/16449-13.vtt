WEBVTT

00:09.593 --> 00:11.302
Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.679
Oh. Fine, Dave, just fine.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.723
I put your mail on your desk

00:15.807 --> 00:19.810
and you have an appointment later
with the Director of Point Calculations.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.689
Let's reschedule that.
Those things last like a thousand years.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.651
Listen, we got the files
for the new crop of incoming

00:26.735 --> 00:29.654
and the Big Guy thinks it's time
for you to fly solo.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.823
I get to design it myself?

00:32.908 --> 00:35.535
You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.164
It's... Oh.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.753
Oh, Dave. I'm gonna work so hard.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.005
OK. Easy there, rookie.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.174
Starting immediately,
you'll be out of my department.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.093
You'll be reporting directly
to the front office.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.137
This is your shot. Good luck.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.441
The bad place is owed two people.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.653
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.280
I don't care which two of you go.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.614
You can decide.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.907
You have 30 minutes.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.122
All I ever wanted
was for this neighbourhood

01:21.582 --> 01:23.666
my first neighbourhood, to be perfect.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.459
Somehow I blew it and...

01:26.920 --> 01:28.045
now you're all suffering

01:28.547 --> 01:30.423
and for that, I'm deeply sorry.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.848
This is truly
the saddest day of my life.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.030
OK, I guess I'll speak first.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.158
Jason and I are the mistakes.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.078
We're the ones who misled everybody
and dragged you all into this mess, so

02:01.663 --> 02:02.913
we should go to the Bad Place.

02:02.998 --> 02:03.956
Agreed.
- Yes.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.835
OK, I thought you were gonna at least
pretend to fight me on that but whatever.

02:07.919 --> 02:12.131
Hang on. That judge guy just said
everyone here has done bad things.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.634
Let's look at this ethnically.

02:14.718 --> 02:18.346
For what I hope is the last time.
It is "ethically".

02:18.430 --> 02:20.306
You guys helped me and Eleanor, right?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.976
But we're bad,
so you helping us was bad.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.062
It's basic consequentialism:

02:26.146 --> 02:28.856
the morality of an action
is solely judged on its consequences.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.608
Great. That's...

02:30.692 --> 02:33.778
The one time you actually remember
something from class.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.238
Maybe I was brought here by mistake,
but since we've been here

02:36.323 --> 02:38.199
I just tried to stay
out of everyone's way.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.117
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.578
He murdered Janet. He killed my wife!

02:42.663 --> 02:44.455
I was trying to stop you from doing it!

02:44.539 --> 02:45.623
Yeah, but you did it.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.083
He who smelt it, murdered Janet.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.210
OK, well, it's settled then.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.212
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.005
For the last time, my name is Jason

02:53.090 --> 02:55.007
not Jianyu,
the amazing, incredible monk.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.093
Which is why
you belong in the Bad Place.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.138
And by the way, Janet is not your wife.
Or your soulmate.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.723
There's a Janet in every neighbourhood.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.392
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.853
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff,
which almost turned out to be sex

03:08.063 --> 03:10.564
and we were married in a legal ceremony.
- It was not legal.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.566
OK, J-bones, you and me, outside.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.693
What? But...

03:14.945 --> 03:16.779
I'm not going. I don't wanna.

03:16.863 --> 03:22.284
I know you don't wanna, goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it

03:22.953 --> 03:25.538
Chidi and Tahani are better people
than we are.

03:25.831 --> 03:30.543
We tried to improve ourselves
and you know what, we did a good job.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.253
Well, I did a good job.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.423
You mostly fell asleep in class
or made fart noises with your hands.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.800
I could never do that on Earth.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.302
This place truly is paradise.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.471
Look at them

03:43.014 --> 03:45.975
whispering away
like two Beefeaters on a tea break.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.977
I bet they're plotting against us.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.687
No way. Eleanor wouldn't do that.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.231
You do have feelings for her, don't you?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.942
I don't know. Y-Yes. But no.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.445
OK, please don't make me think
about this again. My brain will break.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.531
I'm sorry, it's just that I have
certain feelings for you.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.116
You must see this.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.910
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.037
At first,
we both get fraudulent soulmates

04:07.122 --> 04:09.623
and now we may be going
to the Bad Place together.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.418
It's meaningful, don't you think?

04:12.502 --> 04:17.131
This whole romantic situation
is such a mess.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.426
I am vexed, Tahani. Vexed.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.887
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to contribute to your misery.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.638
It's just that I'm frightened.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.974
I don't have an actual soulmate.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.853
What's gonna happen to me
when Jason and Fake Eleanor go

04:30.937 --> 04:33.022
and you're off with Real Eleanor?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.692
Whither Tahani?
- OK. Team meeting.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.070
Jason has agreed
that the two of us should go.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.823
Bye, Tahani.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.825
Sorry for everything.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.579
After I'm gone, you can go ahead
and clean out my bud hole.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.247
Thank you.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.503
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit?

04:55.587 --> 04:56.629
I will not.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.632
It is literally impossible
for me to do that.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.511
Well, it's been real, dog.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.306
Sorry, that's how I ended
most of my serious relationships.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.600
Yeah, that checks out.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.728
I feel like I failed you.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.854
No.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.065
Don't ever think that.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.444
I was dropped into a cave...

05:21.738 --> 05:23.113
and you were my flashlight.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.700
Oh, goodbye forever.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.703
I will miss you so much.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.373
Oh, I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.169
OK, ready, bud?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.672
It's gonna get freaky down there.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.631
<i>Noice.</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:42.216
Not in a good way, dummy.

05:42.926 --> 05:47.304
Whatever happens, if we possibly can,
we gotta stick together. OK?

05:48.890 --> 05:49.932
Good.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.058
Let's grab Michael.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.061
Come in.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.856
Hi, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.815
Um...

05:58.441 --> 06:01.110
I'm going to the Bad Place.
I'm taking one of the slots.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.069
What?
- Awesome.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.946
I've been there. I know I can hack it.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.908
Actually, I have kind of a rapport
with some of the fire monsters.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.996
Also, if I can prevent someone else
from being tortured

06:12.289 --> 06:14.248
I should. It just seems right.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.876
Eleanor, that's crazy. You belong here.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.460
There's another reason.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.756
Everyone here
is supposed to have a soulmate

06:23.633 --> 06:26.260
and my soulmate doesn't love me.

06:27.804 --> 06:33.517
I don't know if you love the other Eleanor,
or Tahani, or someone else, but...

06:34.352 --> 06:37.646
you don't love me,
which means that this...

06:38.857 --> 06:41.025
will never really be my Good Place.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.821
I'm going, so you only have to choose
one more person.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.410
OK, that means...

06:51.912 --> 06:53.787
That means that... What does that mean?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.789
It means...

06:56.958 --> 06:59.126
I get to stay here with my wife forever!

06:59.377 --> 07:00.502
We did it, Eleanor!

07:00.879 --> 07:04.131
USA! USA! USA!

07:06.259 --> 07:08.260
USA! USA!

07:08.345 --> 07:11.096
Woohoo! This is so dope!
I get to stay.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.767
You realise if you stay,
I still have to go, right?

07:15.060 --> 07:18.312
Yes, but, I get to stay.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.314
Good point, bud.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.899
Well reasoned.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.987
Wow. Chidi is a terrible writer.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.034
This is a real mess, huh?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.786
No matter what they decide

07:33.870 --> 07:36.246
I bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water
with your boss.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.458
Wouldn't be surprised
if retirement were on the table.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.503
Retirement?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.629
Course, what do I know?

07:44.172 --> 07:46.924
I'm just the All-knowing Judge
of All Matters in the Afterlife.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.343
But face it, this is your mistake.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.098
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.142
Which one's which? I always forget.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.561
Black is regular. Orange is anti-matter.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.650
Working on your first solo design, right?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.235
How's it coming?

08:06.861 --> 08:07.903
Fine.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.363
I guess.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.576
Do you ever get the feeling
we could be doing it all... differently?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.453
I mean, it's always the same.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.788
We get the names

08:18.498 --> 08:22.334
come up with the design, they arrive,
we move onto the next one.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.878
We never even get to be there...

08:25.714 --> 08:27.172
to see how fun it is.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.590
Yeah, that is a bummer,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.634
but it's a good system.
I mean, it works, right?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.889
But don't rock the boat here, pal.
Just try to do a good job.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.226
French vanilla?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.520
Regular anti-matter's fine.
Why flavour it?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.441
A good job.

09:01.750 --> 09:06.170
OK, all things being equal,
and please check my ethical math here

09:06.671 --> 09:09.506
the right move for me is to go, right?

09:09.924 --> 09:11.925
Jason does seem to love Janet.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.261
And he's not taking anyone's place

09:14.345 --> 09:16.555
because the real Jianyu
isn't even dead yet.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.223
So I should go.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.600
Wow.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.644
You're making decisions
based on what's best for other people.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.772
Yeah, dude. I'm not a monster...

09:26.357 --> 09:27.232
anymore.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.194
Alright, nerds, it's settled.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.322
I'll go to the Bad Place
with Real Eleanor

09:33.406 --> 09:36.492
and you three can stay.
- Yes! We get to stay, baby. We did it!

09:36.576 --> 09:37.910
Wait, no.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.161
You're not going.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.081
I am.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.165
What?
- Why?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.792
Real Eleanor is my soulmate

09:44.876 --> 09:46.502
or was my soulmate

09:46.586 --> 09:49.213
and she's only going down there
because she thinks that I don't love her.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.339
Do you?
- I don't know.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.924
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.050
The point is

09:53.134 --> 09:55.928
if she's going down there because of me,
I'll never be at peace.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.513
Plus, Jason's right.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.765
I've done plenty of terrible things
since I've gotten here.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.058
I deserve to go.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.102
Yes! We get to stay, baby.
We did it!

10:03.186 --> 10:04.978
No, dude, this is bonkers.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.688
I am going. End of story.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.691
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor.
End of discussion.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.361
No. I'm going. End of everything.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.655
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi?

10:14.739 --> 10:17.241
No. I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.659
Chidi and I are going to go together

10:18.743 --> 10:21.453
which means that you and Real Eleanor
and Jason can stay.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.664
Yes! We get to stay, baby.
We did it!

10:24.207 --> 10:27.793
Look, I love you,
and I think you love me.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.922
We can be together,
away from everyone else.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.465
Obviously, we'll be miserable

10:33.550 --> 10:37.302
but I truly believe
our love will make us happy.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.181
OK, you realise the Bad Place is not
some sort of couples' retreat, right?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.058
If it is, Janet and I would like to go.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.185
I am going! And Real Eleanor is going!

10:45.270 --> 10:46.562
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.105
No, I'm going with Chidi.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.648
Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.775
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.277
Hey, that's racist.
- Not a robot.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.404
Oh, you have some nerve.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.363
Guys?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.324
Guys!

10:59.701 --> 11:02.744
The only reason why I'm going
is because Real Eleanor is going.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.955
If you go,
it doesn't make sense for me to go.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.292
Look. You're not listening to me.

11:08.376 --> 11:13.046
Holy motherforking shirtballs.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.800
What?
- Oh, man!

11:18.094 --> 11:19.136
Wow!

11:20.054 --> 11:22.014
OK, OK.

11:22.599 --> 11:23.974
Uh, whoo!

11:24.058 --> 11:25.893
Yo, Mikey! Shawn!

11:26.769 --> 11:27.811
Come on out!

11:31.316 --> 11:34.443
Is everything OK?
- Right as rain, Mikey, my boy.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.571
So, Chidi and I
are gonna go to the Bad Place.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.907
What?
- Trust me. I've got this.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.242
That's our decision. Let's hit it.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.494
Well... What about Real Eleanor?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.413
No, it's me and Chidi. Call the train.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.209
Point of order. I don't accept this offer.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.377
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.463
Gah, gah, gah, gah!
You said any two of us.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.465
It's me and Chidi. Let's do it to it.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.886
Michael! I just found
an obscure precedent in the rules

12:00.970 --> 12:02.262
that might just save everyone.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.556
Buzz off, Bambadjan.
Don't need it.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.517
Uh, OK.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.396
Ready when you are, boss.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.273
Eleanor, what's going on?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.943
It took me a while to figure it out

12:16.527 --> 12:19.988
but just now as we were all fighting
and yelling at each other

12:20.073 --> 12:22.574
and each one of us demanding
we should go to the Bad Place

12:23.660 --> 12:26.453
I thought to myself,
"Man, this is torture".

12:27.163 --> 12:28.205
And then it hit me.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.709
They're never gonna call a train
to take us to the Bad Place.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.797
They can't. Because we're already here.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.842
This is the Bad Place.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.481
Oh, man!

12:55.900 --> 12:57.985
I can't believe you figured it out.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.030
Oh, God!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.908
You... You ruined everything,
you know that?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.579
Oh, man.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.374
Eleanor, you really suck!

13:12.875 --> 13:14.668
I was so close to pulling it off!

13:22.510 --> 13:24.469
Sorry. So she's right?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.263
Yeah, she figured it out.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.808
No... No, this doesn't make any sense.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.353
This is paradise.
- Oh, it looks like paradise

13:33.771 --> 13:38.859
but it's actually a filthy dumpster
full of our worst anxieties.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.362
I'm surrounded by people
who are literally better than me.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.325
Just me being here forced Chidi
into an ethical clusterfork.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.617
Tahani tortured Jason

13:47.702 --> 13:49.411
by constantly trying to get him to talk

13:49.704 --> 13:52.289
Jason tortured me because I was sure
he would blow our cover

13:52.373 --> 13:55.250
which was torture for Chidi,
because he was responsible for me

13:55.335 --> 13:57.586
which made Chidi
seem like the perfect soulmate

13:57.670 --> 14:00.047
and that tortured Tahani
because he didn't love her.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.841
You don't love me?
- Please, don't ask me that right now.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.925
See?

14:04.010 --> 14:07.679
We've been torturing each other
since the moment we arrived

14:08.097 --> 14:11.516
and everything Michael has done
has made at least one of us miserable.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.062
I had to be his assistant
and try and find myself.

14:15.438 --> 14:19.316
He convinced me
to throw my life's work in the garbage.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.111
He made sure I'd see
those bogus neighbourhood rankings

14:23.196 --> 14:25.364
because he knew I'd hate
being second-to-last.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.785
And I had the perfect bud hole
and no dudes to share it with.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.204
He played us like a fiddle.

14:33.039 --> 14:33.955
You gotta give it up.

14:34.040 --> 14:34.915
Oh, dip!

14:34.999 --> 14:38.210
Eleanor, I told you that first night
that we were in a prank show.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.089
Oh, yeah. You did. Great job, man!

14:43.383 --> 14:44.883
Chidi, don't go!

14:45.968 --> 14:48.762
I don't care if you don't love me.
I love you.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.182
It's the only thing that makes
any sense to me in this crazy world

14:52.975 --> 14:55.185
and I think we should stay and try--

14:55.269 --> 14:58.397
No, stop, Vicky. They figured it out.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.234
- They...
- They know this is the Bad Place.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.819
Eleanor figured it out.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.990
Oh, man!

15:09.075 --> 15:10.534
This was supposed to be my big moment.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.495
I just rehearsed that speech
for, like, three hours.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.873
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst

15:17.166 --> 15:18.333
and you can all suck it.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.462
Do you remember what I told you

15:22.547 --> 15:25.048
when you predicted you could do this
for a thousand years?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.302
The time has come to innovate.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.975
The human afterlife can be more fun--

15:36.144 --> 15:39.062
for us, obviously,
not for the people we're torturing.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.981
Who cares about those dummies?

15:42.817 --> 15:46.611
I present to you the perfect recipe
for my proposed experiment.

15:47.321 --> 15:51.825
Four people, perfectly suited
to make each other miserable.

15:53.369 --> 15:59.833
I am going to design an afterlife
where they torture each other.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.834
We've tried this.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.044
Humans are very reticent
to torture each other.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.921
Even getting them to do simple things

16:05.006 --> 16:07.007
like pulling out each other's teeth
is like...

16:08.801 --> 16:10.302
I can't think of the right analogy.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.762
Uh, what makes you think
that you can get them to do this?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.640
Because they won't even know
that they are doing it.

16:16.017 --> 16:20.020
I'm going to make them think
that they are in the Good Place

16:20.354 --> 16:22.856
and to make sure
that they drive each other insane

16:23.649 --> 16:24.691
I will be there

16:25.568 --> 16:29.196
posing as a Good Place architect.
- What?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.907
I even stole a Good Place Janet
we can use.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.493
It can work.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.288
Look, we can just send them all
to the hot spike pits

16:38.372 --> 16:39.498
with the lava and the bees

16:39.582 --> 16:41.541
and the lightning
that tears off their flesh.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.710
Let's try something new.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.047
The thrill of watching them torture
each other

16:47.381 --> 16:51.801
with personal deception and jealousy
will be so much more fulfilling than

16:52.386 --> 16:54.971
I don't know, uh,
pouring spiders into people's eyes

16:55.056 --> 16:56.723
for, like, the zillionth time.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.475
Hey, the spiders work great.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.644
Val, no one is criticising the spiders.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.854
No... You've done amazing work
with the spiders.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.857
Too many variables. Too many moving parts.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.567
That's what will make it fun.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.986
I cannot predict everything
that's gonna happen

17:10.404 --> 17:11.446
but we'll improvise.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.281
We'll... We'll be on our toes.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.407
It'll be exciting.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.576
I think...

17:17.495 --> 17:19.538
that we can get them
to torture each other...

17:21.332 --> 17:22.374
for a thousand years.

17:22.917 --> 17:27.045
I think you'd be lucky to get six months
out of this insane gambit.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.131
But take me through it.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.260
- How would this work, exactly?
- Oh.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.554
Yes, all right, so...

17:36.639 --> 17:39.266
This is a 14 million-point plan.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.727
Um... Oh, sorry.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.146
I thought we reserved the conference room.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.898
No, Todd, we have it until three.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.316
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.569
So...

17:51.070 --> 17:56.199
Bambadjan, and Pavita,
and Gunnar, and Shawn...

17:56.284 --> 17:57.867
Everyone else in this neighbourhood--

17:57.952 --> 17:59.119
Except for you four

17:59.620 --> 18:02.831
everyone in this neighbourhood
is one of us.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.333
After I came up
with everyone's characters

18:05.418 --> 18:08.628
we'd just create fun scenarios
designed to torture you.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.922
How can I be over it?
We haven't discussed it

18:11.007 --> 18:12.716
or even spoken for days.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.051
Well, it sounds like
you've had a really nice vacation

18:15.136 --> 18:16.553
from your full-time job.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.762
Get your story straight.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.806
OK.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.976
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.313
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.149
Oh, uh, maybe my specialty was I...
Identity theft cases.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.817
Oh, he'll love it. Love!

18:31.402 --> 18:34.487
Now, Tracy, you're his soulmate, Nina...

18:35.364 --> 18:36.531
a marriage counsellor.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.908
Maybe we can get them to swing with us.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.578
That's perfect, perfect!

18:41.829 --> 18:42.871
Shh, shh, shh.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.749
Hey, guys? It's Michael.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.293
That was really a fun time.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.671
Then it all started to go off the rails.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.007
When I confessed.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.260
<i>You had no idea I was gonna do that</i>

18:57.553 --> 19:00.347
<i>because, honestly,
I had no idea I was gonna do that</i>

19:00.431 --> 19:02.223
<i>Yeah, that came out of nowhere.</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:05.602
I mean, after that,
it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.813
You know, I... I definitely underestimated

19:08.898 --> 19:11.941
how effective Chidi was gonna be
teaching you to be good

19:12.026 --> 19:16.279
and obviously, we didn't anticipate
that Janet would fall in love with Jason.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.907
Hang on. That part is real?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.701
Oh, yeah. Janet isn't one of us.

19:21.786 --> 19:25.997
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe
for all of the neighbourhoods

19:26.082 --> 19:26.998
good and bad.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.835
And apparently,
this Janet is in love with Jason.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.962
I mean, co... What a world, huh?

19:33.047 --> 19:34.214
I knew it.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.466
I love you so much, baby.

19:36.550 --> 19:41.012
And I, in an indefinable way
that is not communicable through language

19:42.014 --> 19:42.889
love you.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.265
Wait, I don't get something.

19:44.350 --> 19:48.812
I know why Jason and I were sent here,
but why Tahani?

19:48.896 --> 19:52.816
Oh yeah. Didn't you raise, like,
$5,000 for charity or whatever?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.902
Uh, 60 billion, actually, so...

19:58.239 --> 19:59.114
Oh.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.282
But it didn't matter...

20:02.952 --> 20:04.828
because my motivations were corrupt.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.499
I didn't care about helping the people
I raised the money for.

20:10.292 --> 20:14.170
<i>I just wanted to prove my parents wrong,
and stick it to my sister</i>

20:14.630 --> 20:15.880
<i>get fame and attention.</i>

20:16.424 --> 20:19.092
My only real goal was to snog
Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.095
Which I did.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.305
Couple of times, actually.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.807
Well, well, well.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.936
Looks like Duchess Perfecto
wasn't so perfect after all.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.313
I don't really think now
is the time to gloat, Eleanor.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.107
Don't care. Gonna gloat a little.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.569
But wait, why is Chidi here?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.820
Well, um...

20:39.613 --> 20:42.031
there's something
you don't know about me.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.367
I read an article saying that...

20:44.952 --> 20:46.911
growing almonds was bad
for the environment

20:46.996 --> 20:50.999
and yet I continued to use
almond milk in my coffee--

20:51.083 --> 20:52.625
No, dingus!

20:53.252 --> 20:58.089
You hurt everyone in your life
with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.093
Oh, fork!

21:03.137 --> 21:04.012
You're right.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.975
<i>Every friend, every girlfriend
was driven nuts</i>

21:09.059 --> 21:11.102
<i>because I couldn't do anything.</i>

21:11.437 --> 21:12.937
<i>I missed my mom's back surgery</i>

21:13.022 --> 21:16.399
because I had already promised
my landlord's nephew

21:16.484 --> 21:18.693
that I would help him
figure out his new phone.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.361
I made everyone miserable.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.238
Well, if it makes you feel any better

21:22.323 --> 21:24.741
you were the closest
to actually getting in, up there.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.578
You weren't that close.
You were just the closest.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.288
Well, that makes me feel worse somehow.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.749
Good. Thank you, Chidi.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.959
I... I really needed to hear that
right now.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.588
I mean, all this hard work,
all the planning, all for nothing.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.799
It really sucks.

21:40.883 --> 21:41.841
No, it doesn't.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.511
This is wonderful.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.180
You saw us all on Earth -

21:47.807 --> 21:52.101
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ,
a tortured academic

21:52.186 --> 21:55.814
a hot, rich fraud with legs for days...

21:57.066 --> 21:59.400
Side note, I might legit be into Tahani...

21:59.985 --> 22:01.319
but that's for another time.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.155
You thought we would torture each other

22:04.949 --> 22:06.449
and we did for a little

22:06.534 --> 22:08.284
but we also took care of each other.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.578
We improved each other

22:11.247 --> 22:12.914
and the four of us became a team.

22:13.499 --> 22:19.045
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing
was bringing us all together.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.673
Oh, Eleanor...

22:22.883 --> 22:23.758
that's it!

22:24.426 --> 22:27.846
My big mistake
was bringing you all together

22:27.930 --> 22:31.057
h-having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.019
Next time, I'll spread you out,
so it's more of a slow burn.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.771
Uh, next time?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.314
I'm gonna, uh, erase your memories

22:38.399 --> 22:40.733
you know, make a few changes
and start over again.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.444
Hopefully. Just gotta get
the boss man to sign off.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.238
Wish me luck.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.287
Guys, we need a plan. Quick.

22:52.663 --> 22:53.788
Tahani, anything?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.332
Chidi, I need ya. You're the smart one.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.293
I... I... I can't. I. . I can't.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.378
- Jason?
- What? What's up?

23:00.462 --> 23:01.337
Ugh!

23:02.381 --> 23:03.965
What do you say?
Take two, huh?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.425
I don't know.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.968
I mean, what is this?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.970
All this work for four people

23:09.597 --> 23:11.431
and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.767
I feel like a real weeny.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.812
Look, for a first attempt
it was actually very promising.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.149
Let me...
Let me just tinker a little, try again.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.942
OK

23:23.694 --> 23:25.486
but you're way out on a limb here, Mike.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.990
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.702
Guys, he is going
to erase our memories at any second

23:32.786 --> 23:34.537
and all of this
will have been for nothing.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.789
Ugh! You're useless!

23:39.668 --> 23:41.169
What do I write? What do I write?

23:41.253 --> 23:42.211
Ooh, come on, brain.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.509
Janet?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.846
You can't eat anything, right?
- Correct.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.972
Open up.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.892
All right, let's try again,
shall we?

23:56.352 --> 23:58.770
You know what, bro?
Do your worst.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.105
We figured it out once,
we can do it again

24:01.440 --> 24:02.815
because you know what, Michael?

24:04.485 --> 24:05.360
Ya basic...

24:18.457 --> 24:20.500
Eleanor, come on in.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.838
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.757
Your life on Earth has ended

24:28.175 --> 24:32.303
and you're now in the next phase
of your existence in the universe.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.056
Cool.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.603
<i>You know the way you feel when you see</i>

24:40.688 --> 24:43.564
<i>a chimpanzee and a baby tiger
who've become friends?</i>

24:44.483 --> 24:47.443
<i>That's how you're
going to feel every day.</i>

24:50.364 --> 24:54.450
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan,
that really put you over the top.

24:54.535 --> 24:55.785
You got a tonne of points for that.

24:57.413 --> 25:01.374
Eleanor? I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soulmate.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.918
Cool. Bring it in, man.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.088
So where are you from, Chris?

25:07.172 --> 25:10.383
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
and I was a mailman.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.552
Really?

25:15.139 --> 25:18.641
Chris, you'll stand by me
no matter what, right?

25:18.726 --> 25:21.477
Hold that thought.
Is it OK if I go work out?

25:21.895 --> 25:26.524
I love working out.
I gotta stay jacked, it's... who I am.

25:26.608 --> 25:27.900
Yeah, you gotta.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.194
Once I'm back,
we'll get to know each other.

25:30.821 --> 25:31.863
Great.

25:32.823 --> 25:33.865
See ya soon.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.117
Hi there.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.077
Who are you?
- I'm Janet.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.787
I think this is yours.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.248
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.791
What?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.010
What the fork is a "chidi"?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.512
Why can't I say fork?
