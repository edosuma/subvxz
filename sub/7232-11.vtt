TO SABOTAGE MY EXPERIMENT.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.873
SO THIS MORNING,

RIGHT THROUGH THE COOLANT TANKS

03:03.057 --> 03:04.475
IN THE SUB-BASEMENT.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.895
- AND THIS IS WHY I DON'T LIKE
APRIL FOOLS' DAY.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.813
- SILKY!

03:08.897 --> 03:10.231
- YEAH, IT STARTS SMALL,

03:10.315 --> 03:11.691

BEHOLD THE TIME PORTAL.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.539
JUST ENTER YOUR
TARGET DATE HERE,

03:26.623 --> 03:29.167
FLIP THIS LEVER THERE,
AND IT'LL BE APRIL 2ND.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.920
- RIGHT, SO ON APRIL FOOLS',

03:32.003 --> 03:34.297
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
YOU HAVE A TIME MACHINE

03:34.380 --> 03:36.633
JUST SITTING AROUND THAT
YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED BEFORE?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.760

A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

03:38.843 --> 03:43.431
I DO.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.851

I DON'T REMEMBER SAYING--

03:52.815 --> 03:55.109
- YES, I BELIEVE
"STICK-TO-ITIVENESS"

03:55.193 --> 03:57.487
IS ONE OF YOUR COMMON
TALKING POINTS.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.821
ALONG WITH "GUMPTION."

03:58.905 --> 03:59.989
- STICK-TO-ITIVENESS MAYBE,

04:00.073 --> 04:02.116
BUT I HAVE NEVER USED
THE WORD GUMPTION.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.118
- OOH, SPEAKING
OF GUMPTION,

04:04.202 --> 04:05.870
I STUCK BUBBLE GUM

BUT I HAVE NAMED IT
THE INFINITY PAIL.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.870

05:34.375 --> 05:36.586
THE PRANK, SUSAN.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.921
IT WAS THE INFERNAL PRANK.

05:39.005 --> 05:39.797

05:39.881 --> 05:41.924
- INDEED...

05:42.008 --> 05:44.260
OH, SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO YOU, SUSAN.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.970
IT GOT OUT OF HAND.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.474
- [groans]
I EVEN PUT AN EYE OUT.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.101
- GO BACK.
STOP THE PRANK.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.311
- WHICH ONE?
- IT'S ON THE LIST.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.271
- WOW,
THAT'S A LOT OF PRANKS.

05:55.354 --> 06:00.610
- SAVE US, SUSAN.

I'LL FIX IT.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.572
I'M GOING TO STOP
