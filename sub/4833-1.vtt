00:27.301 --> 00:29.345
Tired of the same old you?

00:29.470 --> 00:33.516
Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?

00:33.647 --> 00:37.228
Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?

00:37.353 --> 00:38.896
Yeah.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.690
Oh, hello.

00:40.815 --> 00:46.320
I'm White Goodman, owner, operator
and founder of Globo Gym America Corp.

00:46.445 --> 00:50.491
I'm here to tell ya that you don't have
to be stuck with what you've got.

00:50.616 --> 00:53.160
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

00:53.286 --> 00:58.749
At Globo Gym we that understand "ugliness"
and "fatness" are genetic disorders,

00:58.875 --> 01:01.210
much like baldness or necrophilia,

01:01.335 --> 01:05.381
and it's only your fault if you don't hate
yourself enough to do something about it.

01:06.549 --> 01:09.218
That's where we come in.

01:09.343 --> 01:12.555
Globo Gym employs
a highly trained, quasi-cultural staff

01:12.680 --> 01:15.600
of personal alteration specialists.

01:15.725 --> 01:18.644
With our competitively priced
onsite cosmetic surgery,

01:18.769 --> 01:21.939
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning

01:22.064 --> 01:24.108
into a Franken-fine.

01:24.901 --> 01:27.111
Of course, you'll still be you in a legal sense,

01:27.236 --> 01:29.906
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you

01:30.031 --> 01:32.074
than you could ever become without us.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.078
How do I know?
Well, I'm not only the founder of Globo Gym,

01:36.204 --> 01:38.164
I'm also a client.

01:40.750 --> 01:45.796
That's me, six years and 600lbs ago,
before I knew how much I hated myself.

01:45.922 --> 01:48.466
That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.

01:48.591 --> 01:55.306
But don't just take my word for it. Listen
to these Globo gymers tell you how it is...

01:58.809 --> 02:01.479
That feels good.

02:01.604 --> 02:03.856
Oh, the tickle machine.

02:07.109 --> 02:09.277
Crash, no. Crash, out.

02:09.402 --> 02:11.864
Bad dog. No grundle.

02:14.116 --> 02:16.327
Come on down and join the winning team,

02:16.452 --> 02:19.664
because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.958
And we know it.

02:22.083 --> 02:24.126
Spare me.

02:32.635 --> 02:35.930
Mr La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.475
We've been trying to reach you,
but your phone was disconnected.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.104
We'll be shutting off
your water and power at 5pm today

02:43.229 --> 02:48.651
due to an eight-month overdue account.
Thank you and have a nice day.

02:48.734 --> 02:52.947
This is Seth from Videorama.
The following DVDs are now overdue.

02:53.030 --> 02:59.203
<i>Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5
and Mona Lisa Smile. Thank you.</i>

03:14.635 --> 03:17.555
Come on, baby, be there.
Be there.

03:24.186 --> 03:27.773
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

03:38.326 --> 03:44.457
We're just around the corner.
My gym's here. I promise we're almost there.

03:44.582 --> 03:46.417
You guys are lifesavers.

03:46.542 --> 03:49.545
I appreciate the effort.
Don't pull a hammy over it.

03:54.884 --> 03:58.512
Gimme that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on a treadmill?

04:02.391 --> 04:03.392
Hey, Peter.

04:03.517 --> 04:07.188
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.691
Don't hold out on me. What's happening?

04:11.692 --> 04:15.905
It's just I'm trying
this new voicemail-dating thing.

04:16.029 --> 04:20.326
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

04:20.451 --> 04:22.995
There's someone out there for everybody.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.747
- You think?
- Absolutely.

04:24.872 --> 04:29.544
In some cases, there's two somebodies for
one person. I like to call that "the jackpot".

04:29.669 --> 04:31.712
See you later, dater.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.675
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Gordon.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.177
- I'm wailing on my glutes.
- Sounds great.

04:38.302 --> 04:42.473
I'm gonna shock the biceps later,
then some cardio. Keep the body guessing.

04:42.598 --> 04:46.978
- I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. I wanted to ask you something.

04:47.103 --> 04:49.772
- Did you catch the game last night?
- Can I say yes?

04:49.897 --> 04:52.483
Amateur curling championships
on ESPN8.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.987
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

04:56.112 --> 04:58.990
I feel dumb for asking,
but how did you hear about it?

04:59.115 --> 05:02.743
<i>- OSQ. Obscure Sports Quarterly.
- Of course, the OSQ.</i>

05:02.869 --> 05:05.538
Started reading it in college, for the chicks.

05:05.621 --> 05:08.291
- I'm glad that worked out for you.
- Thanks, Peter.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.960
- Bye.
- Love the orange and love the headphones.

05:11.085 --> 05:13.629
When I come back,
I want you on a different machine.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.721
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete.

05:21.846 --> 05:24.765
OK, come on. Let's get this out of here.
You OK?

05:24.891 --> 05:29.145
- You're like a human Chinese puzzle.
- Thanks, Pete.

05:29.270 --> 05:31.564
All that weight is dangerous.

05:31.689 --> 05:36.194
It'll be worth it when I make the cheerleading
squad. Prove to Amber that I'm not a loser.

05:36.319 --> 05:41.073
Hang on a second. You wanna become
a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser?

05:41.199 --> 05:43.659
Yeah. Why?

05:43.784 --> 05:46.537
Nothing. High school's
changed a bit since I was a kid.

05:46.662 --> 05:50.708
Plus, all anyone ever remembers is
what happened at last year's tryouts.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.835
I'm the laughing stock of the school.

05:52.960 --> 05:58.090
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

05:58.841 --> 06:01.260
Justin Redmond. Ready and super-psyched.

06:01.844 --> 06:04.931
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

06:05.056 --> 06:08.935
Good luck to you, making your judgments.

06:09.060 --> 06:12.605
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number

06:13.147 --> 06:15.233
00, Martha Johnstone.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.243
Toss to hands, liberty and cradle out, OK?

06:26.494 --> 06:28.955
I'm not wearing any panties.

06:31.123 --> 06:33.376
Ready? One, two.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.339
Liberty, ready?

06:50.268 --> 06:52.937
- Dude.
- Can he breathe?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.320
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:01.445 --> 07:05.950
- It was the worst.
- Don't worry about this Amber situation.

07:06.075 --> 07:09.161
- It'll all work itself out in the end.
- Thanks, Pete.

07:09.287 --> 07:11.581
You'll laugh at this one day.
I'm laughing.

07:11.706 --> 07:14.792
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

07:16.919 --> 07:20.673
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.264
'Tis about the matter of payment
for me membership.

07:28.389 --> 07:30.349
Steve be a touch short this month.

07:30.474 --> 07:32.602
That's all right.
Just pay me when you get the money.

07:32.727 --> 07:37.106
The dread pirate Steve be in no man's debt.
I'll make a barter with you.

07:37.231 --> 07:43.154
In exchange for your kindness,
I'll be splitting me buried treasure with you.

07:43.279 --> 07:45.281
Once I find it, that be.

07:45.406 --> 07:50.620
I'm flattered by the gesture, but
a couple of bucks here and there will be fine.

07:50.745 --> 07:52.788
Thanks, Peter.

07:52.914 --> 07:55.583
- I'll be on the StairMaster.
- OK, Steve.

07:55.666 --> 07:59.587
- Next time, maybe just say "hello".
- Gar.

08:05.676 --> 08:07.595
Hello.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.640
It's not my birthday till next month,
but terrific.

08:10.765 --> 08:12.934
I'm so sorry. Hi.

08:13.059 --> 08:16.979
I'm Katherine Veatch with Hawthorne Stone.

08:17.688 --> 08:20.107
- Your bank?
- Right. My bank.

08:20.233 --> 08:24.695
- You are very attractive for a banker.
- Thank you. I'm not a banker, I'm a lawyer.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.407
Really? What kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

08:28.533 --> 08:30.993
Sexual harassment, mostly.

08:31.118 --> 08:35.331
But I also handle real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

08:35.456 --> 08:38.918
- This place is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

08:39.043 --> 08:42.004
You were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices.

08:42.129 --> 08:45.258
- I thought those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

08:45.383 --> 08:50.263
No one warned me. What happens now?
I make my payments out to somebody else?

08:50.388 --> 08:54.058
You have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage, or you lose your gym.

08:54.183 --> 08:57.770
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

08:57.895 --> 08:59.605
$50,000.

09:01.732 --> 09:06.070
Personal cheque gonna be OK? Might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her?

09:06.195 --> 09:10.783
I do have to switch some funds. The charity
I like to work with is gonna take a hit.

09:10.908 --> 09:14.370
Mr La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

09:14.495 --> 09:18.165
Yeah.
This is extremely serious, Mrs Veatch.

09:18.291 --> 09:23.629
It's Ms. I'll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities.

09:23.754 --> 09:26.632
Absolutely.
I don't know how you say "Ms" for "Mr",

09:26.757 --> 09:29.510
but if there was a "Ms Mr",
I'm a Ms as well.

09:30.344 --> 09:34.557
You do keep financial records?
Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income.

09:34.682 --> 09:37.894
You kidding? I got a closet full of 'em.
I call 'em keepers.

09:42.690 --> 09:46.527
- Problem is I've never really filed them.
- No kidding.

09:46.652 --> 09:50.072
Just out of curiosity,
who would want to buy this place anyway?

09:50.198 --> 09:52.950
Come on, squeeze it, squeeze it.

09:53.075 --> 09:56.996
Yeah, come on, come on. Get it up.

09:57.121 --> 10:00.541
One more, bitch. One more, bitch.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.419
Yeah. Yeah.

10:03.544 --> 10:06.005
- Now you're my bitch.
- Yeah.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.760
Yeah, baby.

10:10.885 --> 10:14.639
Involuntary spasm.
Look at the show. Enjoy the show.

10:16.724 --> 10:20.770
This a bad time? I could come back.
Looks like some real dude sweat going on.

10:20.853 --> 10:25.191
Add three pounds to the scales in the
women's locker room before you go home.

10:25.316 --> 10:30.112
Refreshment?
I've got protein paste, carb laxative...

10:30.738 --> 10:34.367
- Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?
- I'm trying to cut down on those.

10:34.492 --> 10:37.161
- They're good. They are good.
- Know what you mean.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.288
Walk with me.

10:42.667 --> 10:46.087
Hey, Brianna.
Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.

10:46.712 --> 10:50.299
Nice job, Susie.
You call that a sit-up?

10:50.424 --> 10:52.843
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

10:52.969 --> 10:54.679
There's a good energy in the gym.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.722
Let me guess why you're here, Pete.

10:56.847 --> 10:59.725
Because I bought out
the second mortgage on your gym.

10:59.850 --> 11:04.814
You've got 30 days to make $50,000,
or your gym becomes my gym.

11:04.939 --> 11:07.108
I know we've had our differences...

11:07.233 --> 11:10.945
Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

11:11.070 --> 11:12.071
It was one night.

11:12.196 --> 11:15.658
Or the strip-o-gram you sent me
for the Globo Gym one-year anniversary?

11:15.783 --> 11:19.161
- It was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.539
Let's not get hung up on details.

11:21.664 --> 11:24.333
- We're both professionals.
- Really?

11:24.417 --> 11:27.461
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

11:27.587 --> 11:31.382
My gym's worth over $4 million.
Your gym isn't worth four.

11:31.507 --> 11:35.845
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got cupholders.

11:35.970 --> 11:38.264
- Why would I want cupholders?
- The point is

11:38.389 --> 11:41.392
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

11:41.517 --> 11:43.561
A benchmark in the fitness community.

11:43.686 --> 11:48.608
Your "gym" is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

11:48.733 --> 11:53.362
See, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favours.

11:53.487 --> 11:56.574
I earned this body
and I built this temple

11:56.699 --> 12:00.369
out of nothing more than
a little can-do attitude and elbow grease.

12:00.494 --> 12:03.331
And a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

12:03.414 --> 12:09.503
So if I choose to level Average Joe's to build
a parking structure for my members, so be it.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.839
There's nothing you can do about it.

12:11.964 --> 12:17.011
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit-heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness.

12:17.136 --> 12:22.475
I can only hope that you, and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership,

12:22.600 --> 12:25.269
are inside it when I do.

12:25.937 --> 12:28.147
Show Mr La Fleur out.

12:28.272 --> 12:30.316
Turn it up high, Reggie.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.778
I wanna burn.

12:35.655 --> 12:40.535
So that's the deal. We got 30 days
to raise $50,000, or Average Joe's is history.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.162
I got ten minutes. I'll open it up to some Q&A.

12:44.539 --> 12:48.251
No need to raise your hands,
it's an open forum. OK, Owen, kick us off.

12:48.376 --> 12:52.088
Yes, Peter, - and I'm just spitballing here -

12:52.213 --> 12:56.842
but why don't we pay it off
in Canadian dollars and save some money?

12:56.968 --> 13:01.097
Just so you know, if that's a route
you want to follow, it's 50,000 American.

13:01.222 --> 13:04.559
It would be 70,000, roughly, Canadian dollars.

13:04.684 --> 13:09.730
- How are we gonna come up with $120,000?
- Owen, you don't add them together.

13:09.856 --> 13:14.110
Technically, Peter, I'm sorry to say this,
but it's more like $73,313...

13:14.235 --> 13:17.905
It doesn't matter. We can't come up
with $50,000. We're screwed.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.824
Gar.

13:19.949 --> 13:25.288
- It's an insurmountable amount of money.
- No, it's not insurmountable. Come on.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.332
We can't just sit back
and let Globo Gym take us over.

13:28.457 --> 13:31.502
Average Joe's is too important.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.880
Where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

13:34.005 --> 13:35.965
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

13:36.090 --> 13:39.927
Dwight, Owen, what will you do
if Joe's goes under? Work at the airport?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.931
- I ain't working at no airport again.
- No. Cos you hated it.

13:44.056 --> 13:48.311
And, Steve, where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do?

13:48.436 --> 13:52.857
- Gar. Joe's be the only place for Steve.
- Gar. You're right.

13:53.399 --> 13:57.778
Do you see? There's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

13:57.904 --> 14:01.616
They'd laugh at me there.
Lock me in lockers, make me eat clay.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.577
But not here, not at Joe's.

14:04.702 --> 14:09.624
I need this place.
You guys need this place. Come on.

14:12.126 --> 14:15.046
I got it. I know how we can raise the money.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.757
- How?
- Car wash.

14:34.273 --> 14:37.818
What are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.779
The girls beat us fair and square.

14:39.946 --> 14:45.952
I am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them, personally.

14:46.077 --> 14:50.665
Guys. Not to be a nay-sayer or anything,
but the only customer we've had

14:50.790 --> 14:55.294
is that weird guy
who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

15:00.216 --> 15:05.221
That's it, boy.
Get in there nice and deep, like.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.560
- That's not good.
- Gar. This sucks.

15:21.904 --> 15:24.866
Relax, Justin, it's just a cutout.

15:25.908 --> 15:29.328
At Globo Gym,
we're better than you and we know it.

15:29.453 --> 15:32.290
Sign up now.

15:32.415 --> 15:34.625
Do you smell that fitness? I do.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.169
Rock it and shock it, baby.

15:37.295 --> 15:39.297
You gotta burn it to earn it.

15:39.422 --> 15:43.342
- What's in the envelope?
- Free 30-day memberships to Globo Gym.

15:43.467 --> 15:47.263
- Cool.
- It's ajoke. He sent it to us as an insult.

15:47.388 --> 15:51.350
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money.

15:51.475 --> 15:54.020
- We're further away from saving this place?
- Yes.

15:54.145 --> 15:56.731
- We'll never raise enough money.
- This blows.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.816
Guys, I know this is tough to take,

15:58.941 --> 16:02.987
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn't raise us the $50,000 we need,

16:03.070 --> 16:05.156
I guess it just isn't in the cards.

16:05.281 --> 16:11.662
Trust me here. If there was any way in
the world we could raise $50,000 in 30 days,

16:11.787 --> 16:14.081
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.459
We could sell blood and semen.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.377
What? Not mixed together.

16:18.502 --> 16:20.671
Guys, I love the enthusiasm,

16:20.796 --> 16:24.258
I love the energy here,
but we're looking at this the wrong way.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.053
Let's celebrate the good times
that was Joe's.

16:27.136 --> 16:30.514
We gotta start looking at this Irish-wake style.

16:33.559 --> 16:37.438
Let me be the first
to say goodbye to Average Joe's.

16:37.563 --> 16:41.692
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now let's try to have some fun.

16:41.776 --> 16:45.196
I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song",
and we'll tear this place apart.

16:45.321 --> 16:47.615
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter.

16:48.324 --> 16:50.535
We could play dodgeball.

16:50.660 --> 16:55.289
That's very nice, Gordon, but everyone's
tired. Playing a game isn't gonna help.

16:55.414 --> 17:01.170
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

17:01.295 --> 17:04.173
I read about
the Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

17:04.298 --> 17:06.509
<i>every year in Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>

17:06.634 --> 17:09.220
Of course. That's a totally common thing.

17:09.345 --> 17:13.558
The best part is it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.

17:13.683 --> 17:19.438
- How is dodgeball gonna get us the $50,000?
- They have a cash prize for the winner.

17:19.564 --> 17:22.525
- How much?
- $50,000.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.736
Guys, we are not gonna get $50,000
for playing dodgeball.

17:25.862 --> 17:29.031
- Why not?
- None of us know how to play dodgeball.

17:29.156 --> 17:33.703
I do. We played it in PE last year.
They showed us this film about it.

17:33.828 --> 17:37.123
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

17:37.248 --> 17:39.917
Can we please try to be serious
here for one second?

17:40.001 --> 17:45.339
You said anything we could do to raise
the money. This is that anything. This is it.

17:45.423 --> 17:48.801
Come on, show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

17:49.552 --> 17:51.888
Come on.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.893
Come on, Pete.

17:57.977 --> 18:01.230
You guys had me at blood and semen.
Come here.

18:04.775 --> 18:07.987
You want it, don't you, fat boy?

18:08.112 --> 18:10.031
You want that doughnut.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.909
Go ahead and have a bite.

18:13.034 --> 18:16.954
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

18:22.376 --> 18:24.212
Momma.

18:25.004 --> 18:29.842
- Sir, Katherine Veatch is here to see you.
- Give me 30 seconds and send her in.

18:29.967 --> 18:31.469
Yes, sir.

18:46.984 --> 18:49.028
Thank you.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.454
Hello, Katherine. Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

18:58.579 --> 19:02.083
- You asked me to come over.
- Did I?

19:03.334 --> 19:06.170
Are you reading the dictionary?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.509
You caught me. I like to break
a mental sweat too. Grab a chair.

19:11.634 --> 19:17.765
So, I trust everything's going swimmingly
with our acquisition of Average Joe's?

19:17.890 --> 19:22.603
So far, yeah. There's a lot to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

19:22.728 --> 19:26.691
- That is a really interesting painting.
- Thank you.

19:26.816 --> 19:32.238
Yeah, that's me, taking the bull by the horns.
It's how I handle my business.

19:32.363 --> 19:34.448
It's a metaphor.

19:34.574 --> 19:38.786
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

19:38.870 --> 19:43.916
Anyway, we're a pretty tight-knit tribe here,
but there's always room for one more squaw.

19:44.041 --> 19:48.170
So, please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your boss.

19:48.296 --> 19:50.840
- I don't.
- I don't want to get into a formal thing.

19:50.965 --> 19:53.009
I'm White, you know.

19:53.134 --> 19:54.969
W-h-i-t.

19:57.013 --> 19:58.389
E.

19:58.514 --> 20:01.184
Thanks, Mr Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.

20:01.309 --> 20:03.436
They just assigned me to your account.

20:03.561 --> 20:09.525
Right, well. You work for the bank. Bank
works for me so, ipso fact, I'm your boss.

20:09.650 --> 20:15.907
Point is, I would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.159
There's no reason we need to be shackled

20:18.284 --> 20:22.496
by the strictures of
the employee-employer relationship.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.124
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

20:25.249 --> 20:28.002
In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.797
I'm just kidding.
But seriously, I've got 'em.

20:31.923 --> 20:34.675
I'm just doing my job, Mr Goodman.

20:34.759 --> 20:40.097
In fact, I actually prefer it over there.

20:40.181 --> 20:44.018
Really? You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser-Town?

20:44.143 --> 20:47.355
They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

20:48.773 --> 20:50.942
People?

20:51.067 --> 20:53.611
"People, just like you and me."
Oh, man.

20:53.736 --> 20:57.532
That is what I love about you, Kate.
You've got a "personality".

20:58.491 --> 21:05.748
That is rich. A real sauciness
that I find extremely attractive.

21:07.792 --> 21:10.086
We should mate.

21:10.211 --> 21:11.963
- What?
- Date.

21:12.088 --> 21:15.132
We should date some time. Socially.
Go out and kick it.

21:17.051 --> 21:18.970
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

21:19.095 --> 21:22.431
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

21:23.641 --> 21:26.936
In some cultures, they only eat vomit.

21:27.103 --> 21:30.857
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

21:30.982 --> 21:34.694
I'm sorry, Mr Goodman.
I don't date clients.

21:36.404 --> 21:38.155
I get it.

21:38.281 --> 21:41.826
Don't crap where you eat. I understand.

21:41.951 --> 21:45.788
Me'Shell.
Please escort Ms Veatch out.

21:47.498 --> 21:51.627
And, Katherine, make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly.

21:51.752 --> 21:55.006
They're up to something over there.
I can smell it.

22:02.263 --> 22:08.144
Über-American Instructional films,
teaching America's youth since 1938.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.777
Hey, there, Timmy.

22:16.903 --> 22:20.615
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.577
How'd you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint,

22:24.702 --> 22:26.078
and learn about dodgeball?

22:26.204 --> 22:28.080
Boy, would I.

22:32.043 --> 22:35.338
- Where am I, mister?
- You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.

22:35.463 --> 22:38.925
This is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century,

22:39.050 --> 22:41.344
by opium-addicted Chinamen.

22:41.469 --> 22:44.931
Back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another

22:45.056 --> 22:48.392
instead of the ADAA-approved balls
we use today.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.063
ADAA?

22:52.188 --> 22:55.858
That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.

22:55.983 --> 23:01.531
Dodgeball is played with six players
on each team, and six rubber balls.

23:01.656 --> 23:04.825
The object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players.

23:04.951 --> 23:09.413
Once all the players on one team are
eliminated, the opposing team wins.

23:09.539 --> 23:13.584
Wow. I can't wait
to get the fellas together and play.

23:15.586 --> 23:18.464
Hang on a second there, sport.

23:18.589 --> 23:21.676
- Patches O'Houlihan.
- That's right, Timmy.

23:21.801 --> 23:27.807
Patches O'Houlihan. Seven-time ADAA
All-Star is here to take you the rest of the way.

23:27.932 --> 23:31.561
- Jeepers. Really?
- You betcha, champ.

23:32.019 --> 23:36.065
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground,

23:36.190 --> 23:39.527
the player who threw that ball is out,
not you.

23:39.652 --> 23:44.448
Plus, another player from your team
gets to come back into the game.

23:44.574 --> 23:48.077
- It's a two-player swing.
- Thanks, Patches.

23:48.202 --> 23:51.038
I can't wait to start my own team at school.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.249
Attaboy, Tiger.

23:53.374 --> 23:59.005
But remember, dodgeball is a sport
of violence, exclusion and degradation.

23:59.130 --> 24:02.216
So, when you're picking players in gym class,

24:02.341 --> 24:06.470
remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.

24:06.596 --> 24:12.185
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones, like Winston here.

24:17.231 --> 24:20.109
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

24:20.234 --> 24:23.779
Just remember the five Ds of dodgeball.

24:23.905 --> 24:26.657
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and

24:26.782 --> 24:28.367
dodge.

24:28.492 --> 24:31.495
Till next time.
This is Patches O'Houlihan,

24:31.621 --> 24:36.334
saying, "Take care of your balls
and they'll take care of you."

24:38.002 --> 24:40.838
OK, guys. Any questions? Great.

24:40.922 --> 24:45.760
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf rec centre.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.803
But we haven't even practised yet.

24:47.929 --> 24:51.724
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open.
Tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

24:51.849 --> 24:57.271
Everyone, just relax. I've always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it.

24:57.396 --> 25:00.149
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office doing Mad Libs.

25:00.274 --> 25:02.485
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.487
OK, I think everybody knows...

25:07.990 --> 25:12.119
- Don't you have an office of your own?
- Yes, I do have an office.

25:12.203 --> 25:15.039
A very nice office
with a view and air-conditioning.

25:15.164 --> 25:18.459
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet

25:18.584 --> 25:23.506
of 30 years of financial transactions,
devoid of any filing system known to man.

25:23.631 --> 25:27.552
Hard to believe I only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt.

25:27.677 --> 25:32.640
Do you realise you haven't collected
any membership fees in 13 months?

25:32.765 --> 25:36.727
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

25:36.853 --> 25:40.565
I found that if you have a goal,
you might not reach it.

25:40.690 --> 25:44.318
But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.

25:44.443 --> 25:48.906
I gotta tell you, it feels phenomenal.

25:49.031 --> 25:52.285
I guess that makes sense, in a really sad way.

25:52.410 --> 25:55.162
Sad? You wanna know what's sad?

25:55.246 --> 25:58.082
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

25:58.541 --> 26:02.670
Since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do some abs, go shock it up.

26:02.795 --> 26:06.465
I like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event.

26:06.591 --> 26:09.427
Gotta be limber and loose.
That's the only way to play.

26:09.510 --> 26:14.098
Hey, you guys take vitamins?
I take vitamins all the time...

26:16.559 --> 26:18.895
Dodgeball, eh?

26:19.020 --> 26:24.025
If Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym,

26:24.150 --> 26:26.986
he's in for quite a surprise.

26:35.244 --> 26:38.206
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

26:38.331 --> 26:42.627
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

26:42.752 --> 26:44.879
- Hey, Gord, your family's here.
- Where?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.215
- Right over there.
- Great.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.718
She knows I don't like it
when she watches me. I get all nervous.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.679
- Kids take after you.
- Yeah. She's their stepmother.

26:53.804 --> 26:56.849
I remarried three years ago.
An Internet mail-order thing.

26:56.974 --> 27:01.145
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great. Really great.

27:01.270 --> 27:02.730
Hey, honey.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.485
L for love. Good times.

27:07.610 --> 27:09.654
L for love? That doesn't mean love...

27:09.779 --> 27:12.323
People have different translations for things.

27:12.448 --> 27:16.827
That's a special bond that you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice.

27:16.953 --> 27:19.163
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Two.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.666
If we beat this team,
we're in the Vegas Open?

27:21.791 --> 27:23.626
- Yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.

27:23.751 --> 27:28.714
- Who's the other team?
- I have it right here. Just a sec.

27:28.839 --> 27:33.469
- Troop 417.
- Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts?

27:34.136 --> 27:35.346
Not quite.

27:44.021 --> 27:45.565
Bollocks.

27:51.153 --> 27:53.281
Troop 417, ready.

27:53.406 --> 27:55.074
Average Joe's, ready.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.536
Set. Dodgeball.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.483
I'm gonna send you to hell.

28:39.243 --> 28:44.457
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?
- Why would you hit a girl? Why?

28:44.582 --> 28:46.584
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

28:48.920 --> 28:51.339
Winner - Troop 417.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.507
In your face.

28:53.633 --> 28:57.970
You're adopted.
Your parents don't even love you.

29:00.389 --> 29:06.395
And now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure to award...

29:09.190 --> 29:12.360
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a problem here.

29:13.152 --> 29:16.364
Unfortunately for Troop 417,

29:16.489 --> 29:20.451
during the ADAA-required
random drug screening,

29:20.576 --> 29:25.957
one of your player's urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids,

29:26.082 --> 29:29.961
and a low-grade beaver tranquilliser.

29:30.086 --> 29:34.215
I'm afraid, by rule,
your team must be disqualified.

29:34.799 --> 29:37.134
Goddamn you, Bernice.

29:37.885 --> 29:41.305
By the power vested in me,
I declare the winner of this year's

29:41.430 --> 29:46.853
Dodgeball Regional Qualifying Tournament
and Grammar Jamboree to be

29:46.978 --> 29:48.771
Average Joe's Gym.

29:51.649 --> 29:53.401
You lied.

30:00.366 --> 30:05.454
All I'm saying to you, Kate, is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up.

30:05.580 --> 30:10.042
I was in the neighbourhood and
I thought you could use a cheering section.

30:10.167 --> 30:13.838
Kate, if you wannajoin the team,
all you have to do is ask.

30:13.963 --> 30:16.757
Thank you, Peter. I don't.

30:17.717 --> 30:20.469
It is obvious that you dig me.

30:20.595 --> 30:22.555
- You're hooked on La Fleur.
- God.

30:22.680 --> 30:27.643
I've been through this many times. I'm sorry.
You can't stay away from me. I'm so stupid.

30:27.768 --> 30:33.858
I'll admit that, in spite of yourself, you have
brief moments where you're not completely...

30:35.568 --> 30:38.571
What? I'm not completely what?

30:38.696 --> 30:41.449
Pathetic.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.203
Hey, White. I didn't think
that Nazi camp got out until eight.

30:45.328 --> 30:49.832
- Did you decide to skip arts and crafts?
- Yes, I did.

30:49.957 --> 30:53.961
Hello, Kate.
I wasn't aware I was paying you to socialise.

30:54.086 --> 31:00.885
- You're not. I'm off the clock.
- Isn't it "convenient" for you, and the clock?

31:00.968 --> 31:05.056
I dropped by to congratulate you
on your victory by disqualification

31:05.181 --> 31:09.143
and introduce you to the team that
will win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Open.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.978
My team.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.732
Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to

31:14.857 --> 31:16.901
Blade.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.904
Laser.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.199
Blazer.

31:23.324 --> 31:26.827
<i>I've believe you've met
my fitness consigliere, Me'Shell.</i>

31:26.953 --> 31:31.499
- We met.
- And I almost forgot our last player.

31:31.624 --> 31:36.546
Meet Fran Stalinofskivitchdavitovichski.

31:46.764 --> 31:50.852
In her home country of Romanovia,
dodgeball is the national sport.

31:50.977 --> 31:55.398
Her nuclear power plant's team won
the championship five years running,

31:55.523 --> 32:00.695
which makes her the deadliest woman
on earth with a dodgeball.

32:00.820 --> 32:02.572
Ball me, Blazer.

32:03.030 --> 32:05.408
Show them, Fran.

32:09.829 --> 32:12.540
That's just her change-up.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.709
End of demo.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.712
We are the Globo Gym Purple Cobras

32:17.837 --> 32:21.549
and we will, we will rock you.

32:25.970 --> 32:28.806
I think that guy might really be dead.

32:30.516 --> 32:34.770
Wait a minute. How can you be
entered in the Las Vegas Open?

32:34.896 --> 32:37.148
You didn't win a regional qualifying match.

32:37.273 --> 32:40.568
Oh, my God. We never even won
a regional qualifying match.

32:40.693 --> 32:42.737
Yeah. Now I remember.

32:42.862 --> 32:46.532
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine.

32:46.657 --> 32:49.911
I helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.705
So close your rule book
on that one, Poindextor.

32:52.830 --> 32:57.376
White, we didn't come here to "rumble".
We came here to celebrate as a team.

32:57.501 --> 33:00.630
There's plenty of bar here
for you and the Globo-nauts.

33:00.755 --> 33:02.506
Team?

33:02.632 --> 33:06.594
What team?
Your best player thinks he's a pirate.

33:10.014 --> 33:13.518
First of all, he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be.

33:13.643 --> 33:18.981
Secondly, we don't know who our best player
is yet. We've only had one game.

33:19.065 --> 33:23.819
- It could be any one of us at this point.
- Go ahead, make your jokes, Mr

33:23.945 --> 33:25.988
Jokey... Joke-maker.

33:26.113 --> 33:28.991
But let me hit you with
some knowledge. Quit now.

33:29.116 --> 33:34.372
Save yourself the embarrassment of losing
with these losers in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

33:34.497 --> 33:37.667
Alliteration aside,
I'll take my chances in the tournament.

33:37.792 --> 33:42.338
- Yeah, you will take your chances.
- I know. I just said that.

33:42.463 --> 33:45.591
- I know you did.
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.

33:45.716 --> 33:49.136
<i>- I'm not sure where you're going with this.
- That's what I said.</i>

33:49.262 --> 33:53.558
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.226
Touché.

33:57.937 --> 34:00.898
We're gonna split,
but we'll see you at the tournament.

34:01.023 --> 34:05.987
And, La Fleur, best bring your bib
cos it's gonna get messy.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.827
Are you all right? You OK?

34:14.996 --> 34:17.206
Let's bounce. Cobras.

34:20.626 --> 34:26.674
OK, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

34:33.264 --> 34:34.514
Hey, you.

34:34.639 --> 34:39.395
That was the worst damn display
of dodgeball I've seen in 40 years.

34:39.520 --> 34:42.982
You want a dodgeball victory,
you've gotta grab it by its haunches

34:43.107 --> 34:46.485
and hump it into submission.
That's the only way.

34:46.610 --> 34:49.947
OK, crazy guy. I'm gonna go home now.

34:50.072 --> 34:53.117
I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy.

34:54.327 --> 34:57.246
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

34:57.371 --> 35:00.041
I'm your new coach.

35:00.124 --> 35:03.044
Patches O'Houlihan?
The guy from the dodgeball film?

35:03.169 --> 35:05.963
- Yeah. He said he wants to coach us.
- You said yes?

35:06.088 --> 35:10.218
I figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us.

35:10.301 --> 35:13.346
A'iight.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

35:13.471 --> 35:16.349
No. No, he's totally normal.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.821
I love the smell of queef in the morning.

35:30.947 --> 35:32.990
I mean normal for us.

35:33.533 --> 35:35.409
Line up, ladies.

35:35.535 --> 35:37.870
- What does he mean, line up?
- Now.

35:40.957 --> 35:44.794
If you're gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers,

35:44.919 --> 35:48.714
then you've got to learn
the five Ds of dodgeball:

35:48.839 --> 35:51.884
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.

35:52.009 --> 35:58.015
If you master the five Ds,
no amount of balls on earth can hit you.

35:59.267 --> 36:02.478
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or...

36:02.603 --> 36:07.483
Yeah, shouldn't we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or...

36:07.608 --> 36:10.945
That's what this sack of wrenches is for.

36:16.284 --> 36:18.953
If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.

36:19.036 --> 36:21.080
What?

36:30.882 --> 36:32.675
Any other questions?

36:32.800 --> 36:34.969
My God.

36:35.094 --> 36:40.183
Yeah. Patches, are you sure
that this is completely necessary?

36:40.308 --> 36:42.727
Necessary?

36:42.852 --> 36:47.106
- Is it necessary for me to drink my urine?
- Probably not.

36:47.231 --> 36:52.236
No. But I do it anyway
because it's sterile and I like the taste.

36:52.361 --> 36:53.779
OK.

36:53.905 --> 36:59.410
If you're leading this squad, La Fleur, you've
got to learn to do the dance in the dark.

37:00.203 --> 37:02.121
Here, put that on.

37:02.246 --> 37:04.582
All right, ladies, buckle up.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.292
It's showtime.

37:09.128 --> 37:11.589
Dodge, duck, dip. Dive.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.884
Dodge.

37:15.009 --> 37:16.802
Dive.

37:16.928 --> 37:20.139
Dip. Dive. Dodge.

37:20.890 --> 37:25.561
I've got three weeks to whip you
suck-ass failure junkies into shape.

37:25.686 --> 37:29.273
Come on. I get better runs in my shorts.

37:29.941 --> 37:35.029
Catch a ball, one of their guys goes out.
One of our guys comes back in.

37:35.154 --> 37:38.366
That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.

37:41.077 --> 37:42.995
Let's go. A little hustle here.

37:50.211 --> 37:51.921
That's really good, Peter.

37:55.675 --> 37:59.929
Come on. Only 19 miles to go.

38:03.724 --> 38:04.934
Attaboy.

38:06.811 --> 38:08.813
Next man.

38:08.938 --> 38:12.066
Good luck to you, Gordon.
Remember it's 90% mental.

38:12.191 --> 38:13.192
Okey-dokey.

38:13.317 --> 38:17.530
If you can dodge traffic,
you can dodge a ball.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.202
You got it, Gord.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.168
- I'm fine. I'm OK.
- OK, there.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.136
- Man.
- Wake up, Smithy.

38:45.975 --> 38:50.396
Hell, son. You're about as useful
as a cock-flavoured lollipop.

38:51.147 --> 38:53.524
Quick feet, fast hands.

38:53.649 --> 38:55.568
Catch it and throw.

38:56.277 --> 39:01.115
Pick up the pace. What a bunch of females.

39:04.744 --> 39:07.705
Jesus. Gimme that.

39:08.998 --> 39:12.126
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

39:12.251 --> 39:15.171
Where's your killer instinct?
You gotta get angry.

39:15.296 --> 39:18.966
You gotta get mean.
That's the only way you can play.

39:19.717 --> 39:22.386
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

39:26.724 --> 39:29.393
Are you angry now?

39:29.477 --> 39:34.398
- Breathe it out.
- Come on, let's get going here.

39:41.948 --> 39:43.866
Little help?

39:52.959 --> 39:55.878
What? Eight years of softball.

39:56.003 --> 39:59.757
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

39:59.882 --> 40:02.552
All I know is that dyke can play.

40:14.188 --> 40:16.315
Come on, come on.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.985
- Please.
- We need you. You're really good.

40:19.110 --> 40:21.070
Owen'll be team manager if you play.

40:21.195 --> 40:22.780
- I will?
- Shut up.

40:22.905 --> 40:25.825
Look, I find White Goodman creepy,
just like you do...

40:25.950 --> 40:28.327
All the more reason for you to join us.

40:28.452 --> 40:31.706
Come on, Kate.
Time to put your mouth where our balls are.

40:31.831 --> 40:36.085
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It'd be a conflict of interest.

40:36.627 --> 40:38.796
Suit yourself.

40:38.921 --> 40:42.633
All right, you heard Billie-Jean King.
No crying in the breast milk.

40:42.758 --> 40:45.011
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

40:48.806 --> 40:52.518
We punch the pizza dough down,
and it's time to sauce it up.

40:52.643 --> 40:54.687
Boy, is my mouth watering.

40:54.812 --> 40:58.232
You want to put a big dollop
of that tangy red on the dough,

40:58.357 --> 41:01.277
then use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

41:01.402 --> 41:03.404
Sir, I need you to take a look at...

41:03.529 --> 41:05.448
No. What...

41:05.573 --> 41:10.286
What...
What have I said about knocking?

41:10.453 --> 41:12.747
- Always knock.
- Sorry, sir.

41:12.872 --> 41:18.294
What is so important that you need to
interrupt me in my private reflection period?

41:18.878 --> 41:20.922
These.

41:25.009 --> 41:29.597
- They're getting better.
- Yes. I can see that, Me'Shell.

41:29.722 --> 41:34.143
I'm through playing games. It's time
to end this square dance once and for all.

41:34.268 --> 41:36.395
What about the girl? She can throw.

41:36.521 --> 41:40.525
I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

41:40.650 --> 41:43.486
But rest assured, Me'Shell.

41:43.611 --> 41:49.116
There's no resisting when
White Goodman puts on his shiny shoes.

42:10.054 --> 42:12.223
- Who is it?
- It's White.

42:14.892 --> 42:17.812
- Surprise.
- White.

42:19.230 --> 42:22.191
What... What are you doing here?

42:22.316 --> 42:24.610
How do you know where I live?

42:24.735 --> 42:26.988
It's called the Freedom of Information Act.

42:27.113 --> 42:30.783
The hippies finally got something right.
Just kiddin'. Not really.

42:30.908 --> 42:34.704
Hey. I got some great news. Sit down.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.667
- What is it?
- You're fired.

42:39.792 --> 42:41.460
- I'm what?
- You're fired.

42:41.586 --> 42:45.381
I told the bank that you were stealing
and drinking on the job. They bought it.

42:45.506 --> 42:48.759
They signed some other
pencil pusher to my account.

42:48.885 --> 42:51.095
Why would you do that?

42:51.679 --> 42:54.348
I'm here to begin my courtship of you, Kate.

42:54.473 --> 42:57.476
- You fired me so I'd date you?
- Yuh-huh.

42:57.602 --> 43:00.438
You are a crazy little man.

43:00.563 --> 43:03.232
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

43:03.357 --> 43:05.443
Yeah. Nausea.

43:05.568 --> 43:08.946
If you don't leave in two seconds,
you'll know how that feels.

43:10.781 --> 43:13.576
You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

43:14.535 --> 43:16.370
I can be naughty, too.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.541
Real, freakin' naughty.

43:22.126 --> 43:24.128
- You a naughty freak?
- Need help leaving?

43:26.255 --> 43:27.965
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

43:28.090 --> 43:31.427
Not nearly as much as your hair does.
That's for sure.

43:31.552 --> 43:35.306
But I believe she asked you to leave.

43:37.308 --> 43:41.979
I get it. You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

43:42.104 --> 43:46.651
Pity. I'll let you have
your little moment, La Fleur,

43:46.776 --> 43:54.116
cos after this tournament, your gym,
your life and your gal are gonna be mine.

43:54.242 --> 43:56.369
All mine.

43:57.078 --> 43:59.038
To be continued...

43:59.163 --> 44:01.916
You don't get to touch me, ever.

44:02.041 --> 44:04.460
OK, Romeo. Let me help you up.

44:04.585 --> 44:08.172
Get off me.
Don't you touch me.

44:10.299 --> 44:13.302
It is over between us, Kate.

44:13.427 --> 44:16.430
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
Nobody.

44:30.778 --> 44:34.115
- At least that wasn't weird.
- Yeah.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.201
- Do I smell cookies?
- Hey.

44:38.619 --> 44:41.080
Dear Barbara.

44:48.379 --> 44:50.298
I like unicorns.

44:53.050 --> 44:55.178
I know you said no to joining the team,

44:55.303 --> 44:59.182
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favour to me.

44:59.307 --> 45:00.975
- Peter...
- Before you answer,

45:01.100 --> 45:03.644
you should know you'd have
your own changing room.

45:03.769 --> 45:05.938
- Really?
- Sort of.

45:07.190 --> 45:09.442
And there's also this.

45:10.359 --> 45:12.486
- OK, what's this?
- I overdid.

45:14.989 --> 45:18.618
Look at you. Two expired movie passes

45:18.743 --> 45:23.247
and a coupon for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

45:23.372 --> 45:28.044
- Play your cards right, could be a full body.
- Will you just stop, please?

45:28.169 --> 45:32.173
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

45:32.298 --> 45:35.968
I just want to see White Goodman's face
when we win that tournament.

45:36.093 --> 45:38.429
- You're in?
- I'm in.

45:42.642 --> 45:47.605
Las Vegas. A city built of hot sand,
broken dreams and $5 lobster.

45:47.730 --> 45:51.442
A city where you can get a happy ending,
if you pay a little extra.

45:51.567 --> 45:54.820
A city home to a sporting event
greater than the World Cup,

45:54.946 --> 45:59.408
World Series and World War II combined.

45:59.534 --> 46:03.788
Live from Las Vegas, it's the Las Vegas
International Dodgeball Open

46:03.913 --> 46:06.707
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho" -

46:06.832 --> 46:11.587
bringing you the finest in seldom-seen sports
from around the globe since 1999.

46:11.712 --> 46:15.049
If it's almost a sport, we've got it here.

46:15.174 --> 46:20.972
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this year's
Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

46:21.097 --> 46:24.350
brought to you exclusively
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

46:24.475 --> 46:28.187
We're coming to you live from
the Las Vegas University Learning Annex.

46:28.312 --> 46:30.147
My name is Cotton McKnight

46:30.273 --> 46:34.110
and with me, as always,
is my partner in crime, Pepper Brooks.

46:34.235 --> 46:36.070
Yeah. Cotton, hey.

46:36.195 --> 46:41.617
Everybody, 32 teams in play, that means
four wins is gonna get you in the final match,

46:41.742 --> 46:45.162
the fifth win getting you
the 50K that everyone's chasing.

46:45.288 --> 46:46.289
Cotton.

46:46.414 --> 46:51.752
There's an electricity in the air,
a palpable hue of anticipation.

46:51.836 --> 46:55.298
Immortality - five simple victories away.

46:55.423 --> 47:00.261
They've come from all over - Kathmandu
to Timbuktu, and all points in-between -

47:00.386 --> 47:04.807
to compete in the one
true human test - dodgeball.

47:05.683 --> 47:08.269
A reminder.
All players must be vaccinated

47:08.394 --> 47:12.690
for cholera, syphilis and shingles
before play begins.

47:12.815 --> 47:17.195
Again, dyslexic players
will not be allowed on the court.

47:17.320 --> 47:21.741
Team Blitzkrieg to the tournament floor
for a first-round match.

47:21.866 --> 47:25.203
Only ADAA balls will be used.

47:25.328 --> 47:29.123
Personal balls of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

47:29.248 --> 47:31.709
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

47:31.834 --> 47:36.380
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

47:36.506 --> 47:40.343
So I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

47:40.468 --> 47:44.805
All right. Now we got our thing going on,
maybe we'll start smacking each other.

47:44.931 --> 47:46.974
I hope everything fits.

47:49.060 --> 47:51.646
- Wait.
- Nice.

47:51.771 --> 47:56.275
This isn't right.
This isn't what I ordered.

48:00.196 --> 48:03.950
- What's this?
- What the hell is that? This is screwed up.

48:04.951 --> 48:07.870
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Don't worry.

48:07.995 --> 48:10.164
- We'll play in what we've got on.
- We can't.

48:10.289 --> 48:13.042
ADAA rules require we wear
matching uniforms.

48:13.167 --> 48:17.338
I don't think they require ass-less chaps, OK?

48:17.463 --> 48:22.635
Everybody, calm down. We've got plenty
of time to find other uniforms before we play.

48:22.760 --> 48:26.222
Ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

48:26.347 --> 48:30.184
Come on, let's go.
Let's see some movement. Chop-chop.

48:30.309 --> 48:32.311
I don't see any movement. Let's go.

48:42.905 --> 48:45.741
How about those dodgeball dancers, folks?

48:45.867 --> 48:49.745
- That is some good, clean, family fun, Cot.
- Right you are.

48:49.871 --> 48:52.290
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

48:52.415 --> 48:55.793
The reigning European champ
hopes to extend their empire here.

48:55.918 --> 48:57.962
Appeasement be damned.

48:58.087 --> 49:01.382
Here comes
the relatively unknown challengers,

49:01.507 --> 49:05.720
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

49:15.563 --> 49:17.773
My sweet Jesus.

49:18.774 --> 49:20.776
That's rad.

49:20.902 --> 49:23.738
Hey, asshole, you guys suck.

49:24.197 --> 49:26.699
Thank you. Nice to be in Vegas.

49:26.824 --> 49:29.493
Hi. We're all here and

49:29.619 --> 49:31.495
we are ready to play.

49:34.373 --> 49:36.876
- OK.
- OK.

49:38.753 --> 49:42.924
We get our first glimpse of the Average Joe's
squad, sporting unwieldy uniforms.

49:43.049 --> 49:45.843
I feel like I'm watching a Cher video.

49:45.968 --> 49:47.929
Average Joe's, ready.

49:48.054 --> 49:49.972
Blitzkrieg, ready.

49:50.097 --> 49:51.474
Dodgeball.

49:51.599 --> 49:56.395
And we're under way. Average Joe's
versus the heavily favoured German team.

49:56.521 --> 50:00.316
Of course, S&M gear first made
popular by the lyric poet, Sappho,

50:00.441 --> 50:03.444
- from the island of Lesbos.
- Clean hit. You're out.

50:03.569 --> 50:08.324
Leather and latex belong in the bedroom,
not on the dodgeball court.

50:08.449 --> 50:13.871
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge.

50:14.413 --> 50:18.918
Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated
and coach O'Houlihan is not happy.

50:26.259 --> 50:28.928
This Average Joe's team
doesn't look up to snuff.

50:30.179 --> 50:33.599
Midline infraction.
You went over the line, you're out.

50:33.724 --> 50:36.143
The Average Joe's catches a break there.

50:36.269 --> 50:39.814
The Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defence.

50:39.939 --> 50:42.483
Good toss by the submissive out there.

50:42.608 --> 50:46.737
Just two players left for Joe...
Check that. Make it one.

50:46.863 --> 50:49.740
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

50:50.241 --> 50:54.120
It's all up to the only player
without a Y-chromosome, Kate Veatch.

50:55.329 --> 50:57.373
What a throw.

50:57.498 --> 50:59.584
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

50:59.709 --> 51:01.335
Yes.

51:01.460 --> 51:05.673
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.

51:05.798 --> 51:11.053
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.

51:11.179 --> 51:15.725
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.

51:15.850 --> 51:17.768
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.

51:17.894 --> 51:22.607
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.

51:22.732 --> 51:25.610
Winner. Average Joe's.

51:27.069 --> 51:29.530
My sweet dick, it's magic.

51:29.655 --> 51:30.907
Hey, all right.

51:31.032 --> 51:36.662
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.

51:36.787 --> 51:39.540
I feel shocked.

51:48.257 --> 51:50.259
Losers.

52:01.646 --> 52:04.524
You must be Daddy.

52:04.941 --> 52:09.237
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round

52:09.362 --> 52:13.032
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,

52:13.157 --> 52:16.285
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.

52:16.410 --> 52:19.622
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.

52:24.085 --> 52:27.672
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.

52:33.344 --> 52:35.888
You wanted to see me, Patches?

52:37.181 --> 52:40.852
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.

52:40.977 --> 52:44.063
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

52:44.188 --> 52:46.649
Kate's not a muff-diver.

52:48.484 --> 52:50.528
Hey. That's for you.

52:51.946 --> 52:55.157
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.

52:55.283 --> 52:57.660
You earned it.

52:57.785 --> 53:02.665
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.

53:02.790 --> 53:06.002
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.

53:06.127 --> 53:08.171
Suit yourself, queer.

53:18.472 --> 53:20.266
- Sorry.
- Justin?

53:20.391 --> 53:23.060
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?

53:23.186 --> 53:28.316
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.

53:28.441 --> 53:32.320
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

53:32.445 --> 53:37.158
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.

53:37.283 --> 53:39.535
This is Amber.

53:39.660 --> 53:41.787
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

53:41.913 --> 53:46.792
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.

53:46.918 --> 53:52.507
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.

53:53.424 --> 53:54.926
What?

53:55.051 --> 53:58.012
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

53:58.137 --> 54:01.557
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.

54:01.682 --> 54:04.352
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.

54:04.435 --> 54:06.979
My cousin Ray-Ray. Boop. Dead.

54:07.104 --> 54:08.272
Thanks, man.

54:12.860 --> 54:15.821
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.

54:15.947 --> 54:18.115
We got lucky in the first round.

54:18.241 --> 54:21.827
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,

54:21.953 --> 54:26.082
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.

54:26.207 --> 54:32.630
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?

54:32.755 --> 54:37.426
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

54:37.552 --> 54:41.472
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.

54:41.597 --> 54:43.474
Hands in.

54:43.599 --> 54:45.643
One, two, three, Joe's.

54:47.353 --> 54:49.564
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.

54:49.689 --> 54:51.816
Lumberjacks, ready?

54:51.941 --> 54:52.942
Dodgeball.

54:53.067 --> 54:56.612
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.

54:56.737 --> 55:00.283
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.

55:00.408 --> 55:03.244
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

55:03.327 --> 55:05.997
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.

55:06.122 --> 55:09.083
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.

55:14.172 --> 55:16.841
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

55:19.093 --> 55:23.890
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.

55:24.015 --> 55:28.227
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.

55:30.396 --> 55:33.191
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.

55:33.316 --> 55:36.861
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.

55:36.986 --> 55:38.362
Peekaboo.

55:38.613 --> 55:41.616
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,

55:41.741 --> 55:45.161
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa this is my dojo.

55:46.829 --> 55:49.999
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.

55:50.124 --> 55:55.046
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.

55:55.171 --> 55:58.216
It's gotta be the hair. It's beautiful.

55:58.341 --> 56:02.762
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.

56:04.013 --> 56:09.977
<i>Globo Gym says, "Domo arigato, Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.</i>

56:12.271 --> 56:15.900
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.

56:16.025 --> 56:19.403
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,

56:19.529 --> 56:21.906
the inner-city champs for five years straight.

56:22.031 --> 56:26.702
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.

56:26.827 --> 56:30.373
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.

56:30.498 --> 56:35.670
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.

56:36.546 --> 56:39.215
Winner. Average Joe's.

56:39.340 --> 56:44.220
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.

56:46.764 --> 56:51.352
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.

56:51.477 --> 56:53.187
That's gotta hurt.

56:55.356 --> 56:57.233
B-b-b-bull's-eye.

56:57.358 --> 56:59.652
Winner. Globo Gym.

56:59.777 --> 57:04.824
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,

57:04.949 --> 57:07.493
and they're going to the finals.

57:10.037 --> 57:14.292
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.

57:14.417 --> 57:19.755
It just doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.

57:19.881 --> 57:21.924
Right in the testicles.

57:22.049 --> 57:24.552
Ouch-Town. Population: You, bro.

57:24.677 --> 57:27.805
Average Joe's down to their final two players.

57:29.140 --> 57:31.350
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.

57:31.475 --> 57:34.437
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.

57:35.104 --> 57:36.480
Time. Time is out.

57:36.606 --> 57:40.568
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,

57:40.693 --> 57:43.362
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.

57:43.487 --> 57:45.948
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

57:47.408 --> 57:50.912
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.

57:51.037 --> 57:54.665
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.

57:54.790 --> 57:58.461
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.

57:58.586 --> 58:00.963
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.

58:01.839 --> 58:04.884
You gotta get angry. Get angry now.

58:05.009 --> 58:09.722
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.

58:09.847 --> 58:13.351
<i>Sayonara, auf Wiedersehen and goodbye.</i>

58:26.656 --> 58:30.076
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.

58:30.201 --> 58:32.078
Good deflection there.

58:32.203 --> 58:34.413
Hang on. And another one.

58:34.539 --> 58:37.083
Three balls at once. Who knew?

58:37.625 --> 58:40.127
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.

58:40.253 --> 58:42.630
That's it.

58:42.755 --> 58:45.842
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.

58:46.717 --> 58:48.761
Now it's two on one. Who'd have thunk it?

58:48.886 --> 58:53.766
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.

58:55.935 --> 58:58.521
Incredible. It's one on one.

58:58.646 --> 59:02.441
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.

59:10.658 --> 59:11.659
Winner.

59:12.034 --> 59:15.204
Average Joe's wins.

59:15.329 --> 59:20.376
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.

59:20.501 --> 59:24.338
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.

59:24.463 --> 59:26.924
I never would have dreamed it possible.

59:27.049 --> 59:31.637
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,

59:31.762 --> 59:34.599
I guess it must be the luck of the Irish.

59:38.644 --> 59:42.690
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.

59:42.815 --> 59:43.566
Yeah.

59:43.691 --> 59:48.196
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.

59:55.244 --> 59:56.454
My God.

59:57.413 --> 01:00:01.375
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:04.879
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?

01:00:05.004 --> 01:00:07.131
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

01:00:07.256 --> 01:00:10.301
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.

01:00:11.552 --> 01:00:14.805
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.

01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:16.057
Yeah.

01:00:16.182 --> 01:00:22.772
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.

01:00:24.357 --> 01:00:26.901
I'll be right back.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.163
What?

01:00:39.247 --> 01:00:44.418
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.

01:00:46.629 --> 01:00:50.049
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.

01:00:50.174 --> 01:00:52.426
Will you shut that?

01:00:52.552 --> 01:00:55.221
For all of us, baby.

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:03.688
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.

01:01:03.813 --> 01:01:05.523
Period.

01:01:05.648 --> 01:01:07.775
End o'story.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:13.239
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.

01:01:13.322 --> 01:01:18.911
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.

01:01:19.036 --> 01:01:22.206
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:26.919
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.

01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:30.715
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.720
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:39.140
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside." It works.

01:01:39.265 --> 01:01:42.685
And they love you. Whoo, do they love you.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.770
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

01:01:44.896 --> 01:01:47.148
"Hey." Right?

01:01:49.275 --> 01:01:54.822
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?

01:01:55.823 --> 01:01:59.118
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

01:01:59.243 --> 01:02:00.828
I mean, come on.

01:02:00.953 --> 01:02:05.082
I know you. You know you.

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:08.211
And I know you know that I know you.

01:02:08.336 --> 01:02:10.796
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

01:02:10.922 --> 01:02:14.383
Sooner or later, Average Joe's is gonna close.

01:02:14.509 --> 01:02:18.638
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

01:02:20.264 --> 01:02:24.227
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.

01:02:24.352 --> 01:02:28.231
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

01:02:31.275 --> 01:02:35.363
Money. $100,000. Dodgeball game.

01:02:37.198 --> 01:02:38.991
Take the money.

01:02:39.742 --> 01:02:44.580
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.

01:02:51.504 --> 01:02:53.631
Just sign the contract.

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:02.056
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

01:03:02.181 --> 01:03:06.310
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.

01:03:06.435 --> 01:03:09.939
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

01:03:11.107 --> 01:03:13.234
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:15.903
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.

01:03:16.028 --> 01:03:20.241
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.

01:03:20.366 --> 01:03:23.828
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.

01:03:23.953 --> 01:03:27.081
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

01:03:27.206 --> 01:03:28.416
What's the plan?

01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:31.752
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.

01:03:31.878 --> 01:03:36.090
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.

01:03:36.174 --> 01:03:41.804
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.

01:03:43.264 --> 01:03:45.808
Jesus Christ.

01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:48.436
He didn't mean that.

01:03:48.561 --> 01:03:52.773
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.

01:03:52.899 --> 01:03:55.735
I've never seen him like that.

01:03:57.862 --> 01:04:01.657
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

01:04:01.782 --> 01:04:04.327
You are not a pirate.

01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:16.672
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?

01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:26.182
Dwight...

01:04:26.307 --> 01:04:31.312
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...

01:04:31.437 --> 01:04:33.189
in the bathroom.

01:04:33.314 --> 01:04:35.900
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

01:04:46.327 --> 01:04:48.996
Excuse me, miss. I was wondering if...

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.582
You are the one who stares at me.

01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:54.043
Why is this?

01:04:54.168 --> 01:04:58.756
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

01:05:05.179 --> 01:05:07.557
Watch it, freak.

01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:22.697
Go back to Treasure Island.

01:05:22.822 --> 01:05:25.241
Fag.

01:05:25.366 --> 01:05:27.410
Screw you.

01:05:39.755 --> 01:05:43.593
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match

01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:46.095
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.224
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.

01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:52.894
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.

01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:57.773
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack

01:05:57.899 --> 01:06:01.903
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,

01:06:02.028 --> 01:06:05.823
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.

01:06:05.948 --> 01:06:10.077
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.

01:06:10.161 --> 01:06:13.956
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:18.169
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

01:06:20.922 --> 01:06:22.590
Peter?

01:06:24.967 --> 01:06:26.552
Peter?

01:06:26.677 --> 01:06:29.222
Hello?

01:06:29.347 --> 01:06:30.640
Peter?

01:06:30.765 --> 01:06:33.601
Come on, everybody headed down...

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.987
So what happens on a double fault?

01:06:45.112 --> 01:06:50.451
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.

01:06:50.576 --> 01:06:53.287
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.

01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:58.709
Justin.

01:06:58.835 --> 01:07:02.964
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?

01:07:03.089 --> 01:07:07.218
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:08.803
My God, that's awful.

01:07:08.886 --> 01:07:12.431
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.

01:07:12.557 --> 01:07:15.560
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

01:07:15.685 --> 01:07:17.311
What?

01:07:17.436 --> 01:07:19.480
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

01:07:19.605 --> 01:07:23.442
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.

01:07:23.568 --> 01:07:29.115
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.

01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:33.828
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.

01:07:33.953 --> 01:07:36.038
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.

01:07:36.164 --> 01:07:37.790
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:44.672
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.

01:07:44.797 --> 01:07:46.591
What do you think, Pep?

01:07:46.716 --> 01:07:48.843
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

01:07:48.968 --> 01:07:54.056
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

01:07:54.182 --> 01:07:57.560
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.

01:07:57.685 --> 01:08:01.439
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.

01:08:01.564 --> 01:08:05.860
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.

01:08:05.985 --> 01:08:11.240
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.

01:08:11.365 --> 01:08:14.535
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:18.038
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.

01:08:18.163 --> 01:08:22.292
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

01:08:22.376 --> 01:08:24.795
Who's Steve the Pirate?

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:28.758
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

01:08:28.883 --> 01:08:33.011
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

01:08:34.639 --> 01:08:42.354
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:44.524
Donkeys.

01:09:09.173 --> 01:09:10.758
Go, Donkeys.

01:09:13.636 --> 01:09:16.639
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.

01:09:16.764 --> 01:09:20.100
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.

01:09:20.225 --> 01:09:22.478
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

01:09:22.603 --> 01:09:25.356
I'm sorry, Amber. I got my own trophy to win.

01:09:42.122 --> 01:09:44.584
Now I'm going.

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:54.343
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.

01:09:54.468 --> 01:09:58.014
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.

01:09:58.139 --> 01:10:01.642
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.

01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:06.147
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.

01:10:06.272 --> 01:10:11.027
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...

01:10:12.737 --> 01:10:15.031
Can I get a bottle of water?

01:10:17.575 --> 01:10:19.869
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

01:10:20.953 --> 01:10:24.665
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:28.628
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.

01:10:28.753 --> 01:10:33.716
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

01:10:34.383 --> 01:10:37.762
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.

01:10:37.887 --> 01:10:42.350
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?

01:10:43.226 --> 01:10:49.315
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.

01:10:50.066 --> 01:10:52.818
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:55.613
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

01:10:55.738 --> 01:10:59.784
But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit.

01:10:59.867 --> 01:11:03.371
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

01:11:03.496 --> 01:11:07.708
Right now, it feels a little bit like shame.

01:11:07.792 --> 01:11:13.589
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.

01:11:13.714 --> 01:11:18.678
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

01:11:25.184 --> 01:11:29.230
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy."

01:11:29.355 --> 01:11:33.568
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.

01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:37.905
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?

01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:42.368
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.

01:11:42.493 --> 01:11:46.497
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.

01:11:46.622 --> 01:11:49.876
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.

01:11:51.586 --> 01:11:53.129
Excuse me.

01:11:53.254 --> 01:11:56.674
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
what just happened. Hey, guys.

01:11:56.799 --> 01:11:59.552
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

01:11:59.677 --> 01:12:01.721
Forfeit? Why?

01:12:03.639 --> 01:12:06.809
Well, I don't know what to tell you, but...

01:12:06.934 --> 01:12:10.938
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players

01:12:11.063 --> 01:12:13.983
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.

01:12:14.108 --> 01:12:17.153
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

01:12:17.278 --> 01:12:22.950
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.

01:12:23.075 --> 01:12:26.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me

01:12:26.954 --> 01:12:32.168
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,

01:12:32.293 --> 01:12:36.964
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,

01:12:37.089 --> 01:12:39.217
it gives me great pleasure

01:12:39.342 --> 01:12:44.222
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas International Tournament to be...

01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:46.557
Wait. He's here.

01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:53.814
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.025
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:13:01.072
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.

01:13:01.197 --> 01:13:04.659
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

01:13:04.784 --> 01:13:07.453
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

01:13:08.621 --> 01:13:10.456
Actually, that's not true.

01:13:10.581 --> 01:13:14.836
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.

01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:17.255
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

01:13:19.465 --> 01:13:22.051
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?

01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:26.639
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.

01:13:26.764 --> 01:13:30.643
We might just have a championship game yet.

01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:33.813
Listen to this crowd.

01:13:33.938 --> 01:13:36.107
Unbelievable.

01:13:36.232 --> 01:13:41.571
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.

01:13:41.654 --> 01:13:44.866
And it looks like they've come to a decision.

01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:47.743
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

01:13:47.869 --> 01:13:51.247
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.

01:13:51.372 --> 01:13:54.542
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.

01:13:54.667 --> 01:14:01.799
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.

01:14:01.924 --> 01:14:05.386
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

01:14:05.511 --> 01:14:08.764
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?

01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:12.351
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

01:14:14.187 --> 01:14:17.815
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.984
Good luck, White.

01:14:21.527 --> 01:14:24.697
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

01:14:24.822 --> 01:14:28.242
Prepare to be humiliated on cable television.

01:14:28.367 --> 01:14:30.411
Whatever.

01:14:32.413 --> 01:14:35.583
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.586
What? I got a plan.

01:14:40.546 --> 01:14:46.552
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?

01:14:46.677 --> 01:14:48.846
- "Aim low".
- That's right.

01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:51.933
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.

01:14:52.058 --> 01:14:56.312
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

01:14:56.437 --> 01:14:59.106
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:03.194
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.

01:15:26.884 --> 01:15:29.136
Globo Gym, ready?

01:15:29.262 --> 01:15:32.139
Average Joe's, ready?

01:15:34.475 --> 01:15:35.434
Dodgeball.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.982
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.

01:15:42.316 --> 01:15:45.069
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:49.615
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.659
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.

01:15:51.784 --> 01:15:55.329
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.

01:15:55.454 --> 01:15:58.666
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.

01:15:59.083 --> 01:16:01.210
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

01:16:01.335 --> 01:16:04.005
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

01:16:04.088 --> 01:16:06.048
You're mine next time.

01:16:09.427 --> 01:16:14.390
<i>Right in the tokus.
2-1, ese, and Globo Gym is dominating.</i>

01:16:18.477 --> 01:16:20.897
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:22.815 --> 01:16:25.568
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,

01:16:25.693 --> 01:16:30.448
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.

01:16:30.573 --> 01:16:33.576
Joe's gets an elimination. It's two on three.

01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:35.286
Get out.

01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:37.747
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

01:16:39.749 --> 01:16:43.878
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.

01:16:44.003 --> 01:16:45.755
You're out, four-eyes.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.301
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.

01:16:50.426 --> 01:16:52.094
Word, Cotton.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:57.558
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.

01:16:57.683 --> 01:17:00.436
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.

01:17:02.522 --> 01:17:04.899
They're just toying with the young man now.

01:17:05.024 --> 01:17:07.944
He's gotta avoid getting hit. That's the key.

01:17:08.069 --> 01:17:09.862
Justin, let's go.

01:17:11.113 --> 01:17:12.657
What a great catch.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.077
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.

01:17:16.202 --> 01:17:20.248
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.916
Justin.

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:24.585
I love you.

01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:26.587
I love you t...

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:29.340
Joanie loves Chachi.

01:17:29.465 --> 01:17:33.177
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.

01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:39.517
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.

01:17:41.269 --> 01:17:45.064
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.

01:17:50.194 --> 01:17:56.325
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.

01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:01.372
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.

01:18:02.206 --> 01:18:04.876
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:09.630
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.

01:18:10.798 --> 01:18:12.300
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:18:12.425 --> 01:18:14.886
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:18.139
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

01:18:18.264 --> 01:18:21.267
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.

01:18:21.392 --> 01:18:24.604
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.

01:18:24.729 --> 01:18:26.480
Watch him, man.

01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:28.900
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

01:18:29.025 --> 01:18:30.776
Kick his ass.

01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:34.530
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.

01:18:34.655 --> 01:18:39.118
<i>Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a ménage à trois of pain.</i>

01:18:39.243 --> 01:18:42.955
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

01:18:44.957 --> 01:18:48.669
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.

01:18:48.794 --> 01:18:51.088
Ready? Dodgeball.

01:18:51.214 --> 01:18:56.302
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.

01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:02.308
He gets the elimination.

01:19:03.559 --> 01:19:09.273
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.

01:19:09.398 --> 01:19:13.486
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.

01:19:13.611 --> 01:19:16.364
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

01:19:17.532 --> 01:19:21.619
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.

01:19:21.744 --> 01:19:25.790
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.

01:19:25.873 --> 01:19:30.211
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.

01:19:30.336 --> 01:19:35.341
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.

01:19:35.466 --> 01:19:36.884
All right. Bring it.

01:19:37.009 --> 01:19:40.429
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

01:19:40.555 --> 01:19:42.265
Well, let me tell you,

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:48.187
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,

01:19:48.312 --> 01:19:51.023
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.

01:19:51.148 --> 01:19:57.780
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.

01:19:57.905 --> 01:20:00.283
Pepper needs new shorts.

01:20:02.326 --> 01:20:05.538
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

01:20:06.038 --> 01:20:11.586
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.

01:20:11.711 --> 01:20:15.673
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

01:20:15.798 --> 01:20:20.469
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?

01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:25.224
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:20:25.766 --> 01:20:28.644
This is it, La Loser.

01:20:30.146 --> 01:20:33.816
You ready for the hurricane?

01:20:34.942 --> 01:20:38.654
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.

01:20:39.864 --> 01:20:44.869
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:49.415
- White?
- Yeah?

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:54.128
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.

01:20:54.253 --> 01:20:58.007
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.

01:20:58.132 --> 01:21:04.180
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.

01:21:04.305 --> 01:21:07.391
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

01:21:07.517 --> 01:21:10.561
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

01:21:12.438 --> 01:21:14.482
Come on, talk to me.

01:21:16.108 --> 01:21:18.319
Listen up, crotch stain.

01:21:18.444 --> 01:21:22.782
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.

01:21:22.907 --> 01:21:25.660
You can do it. I believe in you.

01:21:28.621 --> 01:21:30.373
Bye-bye.

01:21:30.498 --> 01:21:31.499
Right.

01:21:31.624 --> 01:21:34.502
Players, turn and step in.

01:21:50.309 --> 01:21:52.854
What the hell's he doing?

01:21:52.979 --> 01:21:55.565
I don't know.

01:21:57.733 --> 01:21:58.943
Get a load of this guy.

01:21:59.068 --> 01:22:02.822
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.

01:22:02.947 --> 01:22:06.826
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.

01:22:06.951 --> 01:22:09.704
He will not be able to see very well, Cotton.

01:22:19.297 --> 01:22:21.841
Ready?

01:22:26.679 --> 01:22:29.098
Dodgeball.

01:22:35.146 --> 01:22:37.398
Goodbye, Peter.

01:22:37.523 --> 01:22:40.359
I always knew you were weak.

01:22:43.863 --> 01:22:46.616
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

01:22:54.499 --> 01:22:57.585
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.

01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:01.005
Winner. Average Joe's.

01:23:04.509 --> 01:23:08.179
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

01:23:08.304 --> 01:23:11.516
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

01:23:11.641 --> 01:23:15.853
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.

01:23:15.937 --> 01:23:17.271
Unbelievable.

01:23:17.396 --> 01:23:21.817
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.

01:23:21.943 --> 01:23:24.529
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.

01:23:24.654 --> 01:23:26.948
But never in all my years as a sportscaster

01:23:27.073 --> 01:23:32.203
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.

01:23:32.328 --> 01:23:37.083
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,

01:23:37.208 --> 01:23:42.046
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.

01:23:42.171 --> 01:23:46.801
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,

01:23:46.926 --> 01:23:51.389
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.

01:23:57.687 --> 01:24:00.731
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

01:24:00.857 --> 01:24:05.319
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.

01:24:05.444 --> 01:24:07.572
Suck failure, freaks.

01:24:07.697 --> 01:24:10.908
Peter, is that true?

01:24:11.033 --> 01:24:12.994
Yeah, it's true.

01:24:13.119 --> 01:24:16.414
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

01:24:16.539 --> 01:24:18.958
It's true that every man has his price.

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:24.046
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.

01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:28.509
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

01:24:29.677 --> 01:24:32.054
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.184
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?

01:24:36.309 --> 01:24:40.938
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,

01:24:41.063 --> 01:24:44.108
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.

01:24:44.233 --> 01:24:47.612
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?

01:24:47.737 --> 01:24:49.113
$50,000?

01:24:49.238 --> 01:24:53.284
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

01:24:53.409 --> 01:24:55.536
Surprise.

01:24:58.873 --> 01:25:03.961
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.

01:25:04.086 --> 01:25:08.925
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:11.969
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.

01:25:12.094 --> 01:25:15.890
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

01:25:16.015 --> 01:25:20.228
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.

01:25:20.353 --> 01:25:24.106
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:25:24.232 --> 01:25:29.654
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,

01:25:29.779 --> 01:25:33.908
which, as of last night, is Average Joe's Gym.

01:25:35.326 --> 01:25:36.744
I'm your new boss, White.

01:25:36.869 --> 01:25:40.248
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.

01:25:40.373 --> 01:25:43.543
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.

01:25:44.126 --> 01:25:47.171
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.

01:25:47.296 --> 01:25:50.883
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.

01:25:52.802 --> 01:25:54.846
Give me that.

01:25:57.765 --> 01:26:00.309
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

01:26:01.853 --> 01:26:04.438
Peter.

01:26:04.564 --> 01:26:07.108
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

01:26:10.778 --> 01:26:15.950
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and

01:26:17.034 --> 01:26:19.328
I guess you're right.

01:26:19.453 --> 01:26:21.789
I'm not really a pirate.

01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:25.710
I don't know, Steve.

01:26:25.835 --> 01:26:28.004
If you're not a pirate,

01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:31.966
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?

01:26:37.138 --> 01:26:38.973
Peter...

01:26:39.098 --> 01:26:40.933
Gar, Steve.

01:26:46.522 --> 01:26:48.149
We missed you.

01:26:51.194 --> 01:26:52.820
Hey, you.

01:26:52.945 --> 01:26:54.989
Hey, you.

01:26:56.741 --> 01:26:58.743
- Joyce?
- Kate.

01:26:59.243 --> 01:27:03.664
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.

01:27:03.789 --> 01:27:06.042
You are amazing.

01:27:09.754 --> 01:27:14.300
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

01:27:14.842 --> 01:27:17.929
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

01:27:18.054 --> 01:27:19.680
You're not?

01:27:19.805 --> 01:27:21.349
No.

01:27:21.432 --> 01:27:23.851
I'm bisexual.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.396
Snap.

01:27:28.022 --> 01:27:31.484
All right, everybody. Smile big.

Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

01:27:40.409 --> 01:27:44.038
I'm here to tell you
you're perfect just the way you are.

01:27:44.163 --> 01:27:49.836
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,

01:27:49.961 --> 01:27:51.754
Joe's is the place for you.

01:27:51.879 --> 01:27:55.299
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

01:27:55.424 --> 01:28:00.263
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?

01:28:00.388 --> 01:28:02.431
Right.

01:28:11.983 --> 01:28:14.068
Spare me.

01:28:14.193 --> 01:28:16.654
I won that tournament.

01:28:19.365 --> 01:28:22.160
Fucking Chuck Norris.

ENGLISH

01:31:27.762 --> 01:31:30.890
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

01:31:31.015 --> 01:31:33.518
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

01:31:33.643 --> 01:31:36.187
Big friggin' surprise.

01:31:37.313 --> 01:31:39.273
I love happy endings.

01:31:42.318 --> 01:31:46.656
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.

01:31:46.781 --> 01:31:49.242
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

01:31:49.367 --> 01:31:53.538
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained."

01:31:53.663 --> 01:31:55.540
All right, fine.

01:31:55.665 --> 01:31:59.293
You want a little somethin'-somethin'
for the ride home?

01:31:59.418 --> 01:32:01.879
Check these boots out for size.

01:32:03.756 --> 01:32:05.925
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:08.177
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

01:32:08.302 --> 01:32:10.221
Damn right, it's better than yours

01:32:10.346 --> 01:32:13.015
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

01:32:14.058 --> 01:32:18.187
What the boys go crazy for

01:32:19.564 --> 01:32:20.690
They lose their minds

01:32:20.815 --> 01:32:23.150
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

01:32:23.276 --> 01:32:25.027
Damn right, it's better than yours

01:32:25.152 --> 01:32:28.739
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:33.536
You happy? Fatty make a funny?

01:32:34.305 --> 01:32:40.891
