Yes.

Okay... I'll go,

01:02.533 --> 01:04.900

tell anyone about this--

01:04.900 --> 01:06.133

01:08.867 --> 01:11.100
Am I still dreaming?
No!

01:11.933 --> 01:13.300
I shoulda caught that.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.300

call it a dream catcher.

There it is.

02:11.767 --> 02:15.067
Okay, Billie... all right.

02:15.067 --> 02:17.667
Maybe you could just apologize
to Dana, you know?

02:17.667 --> 02:19.067
It's not like anyone would
sleep-walk...

02:19.067 --> 02:20.867
into his weird lotion-y bed
on purpose.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.800
He said if I did it again,
he'd make a formal report...

02:23.800 --> 02:25.367
and I'll lose my job.
Uh-huh.

02:25.367 --> 02:29.233
I guess I've just never noticed,
because I usually sleep alone.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.267
That's cool and not depressing.

02:31.267 --> 02:32.867
I'm having a really hard time
with this.

sleepwalking or get my own room.

and I don't have money.

have money! Okay?

from campus...

not coming to life? Am I crazy?"

I don't know. I'm sorry
about that.

06:33.933 --> 06:36.067
No, I just figured you probably
paid extra...

06:36.067 --> 06:37.967

to talk to, you know?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.967
It's more of a gaming society.

09:55.967 --> 09:58.367
What do you mean,
a gaming society?

09:58.367 --> 10:00.067
I can't really talk about it.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.467
I'm not at liberty.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.600
Okay, I'll tell you.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.300
I'm the only girl and there's
like various rituals...

10:09.300 --> 10:11.500
and there's a lot of chanting,
like--

10:11.500 --> 10:13.733
( CHANTING )

10:13.733 --> 10:15.167
Sounds like Eyes Wide Shut.

10:15.167 --> 10:16.567
I don't know what that means.

10:16.567 --> 10:19.600
They're really into role playing
games and aliens.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.200
Are you sure you didn't
accidentally join a cult?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.600
No, I wish.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.400
They're not weird in like
a murder-y way...

10:26.400 --> 10:29.200
they're just like total dorks
and virgins.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.433
It must suck to be that uncool.

10:31.433 --> 10:34.767
One, two, three.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.933
I mean, I would actually like
to help them, though.

10:36.933 --> 10:39.833
You know, get them laid or like,
ooh, get them to a party.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.633
That would be great.
Get them out of the house.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.600
My girls... are actually
throwing me a welcome party.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.200
Isn't that sweet?
You could bring them to that.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.833
Oh, that would be so great.
Yeah.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.333
Because it's probably gonna be
like boring as shit.

10:51.333 --> 10:54.200
So, just, you know,
kind of ease them in.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.233
Yeah.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.933
Switch!

10:59.300 --> 11:02.800
Ooh, I get to sweep!
Gosh, this is a good time!

11:02.800 --> 11:05.367
Tell me about it.
Hah-hah!

11:05.367 --> 11:07.100
So, Theresa, when are you due?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.967
What do you mean?

11:08.967 --> 11:11.500
Right.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.567
Qu'est-ce que c'est ca?

11:12.567 --> 11:13.867
Just a dress I have.

11:13.867 --> 11:15.700
Thought it would be perfect
for you for the party.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.900
Fabulous French comprehension
and taste. I thank you, Holly.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.400
Yeah-hah...
I'll steam it!

11:20.400 --> 11:22.700
Nanoor, you're a dream.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.067
Oh, B-T by the W...

11:25.067 --> 11:26.733
I invited a friend of mine...

11:26.733 --> 11:28.600
and she invited some guys.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.067
I thought, "The more,
the merrier!" So--

11:33.333 --> 11:38.067
The Septeth ceremony is not a
gathering for fools and whores.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.733
It is sacred.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.833
Your hand's bleeding.

11:41.833 --> 11:45.100
Oh... that hurts.

11:46.067 --> 11:47.633
I-- I can uninvite her?

11:47.633 --> 11:48.800
Sounds good.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.067
Okay... so much glass.

11:51.067 --> 11:54.167
Then sweep.
Okay.

11:54.167 --> 11:56.267
Tiny broom.
Mm-hm.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.233
Lesson one.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.300
This is what most people
call "outside".

12:09.300 --> 12:11.200
The temperature is alarming.
Come on, Henry.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.067
Lesson two, these are girls.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.367
My Lady Hawke is out there
somewhere.

12:16.367 --> 12:19.467
Okay, I don't know what you're
talking about and I'm not wet.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.067
It's the worst place to be
as a woman.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.400
Okay, so, lesson three.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.900
If you don't have anything
cool to say...

12:23.900 --> 12:25.833
say nothing and wink.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.233
That's your face's way
of saying...

12:27.233 --> 12:28.833
"I have got a huge donk."

12:28.833 --> 12:31.967
Ooh! This is a perfect girl to
try on, she is a nerd. Billie?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.533
I heard everything you just
said. I was right there.

12:33.533 --> 12:35.533
I'd like to introduce you
to some friends of mine.

12:35.533 --> 12:38.200
Oh... hi.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.067
He has huge junks.
Okay.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.067
Come on, guys.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.200
Hey, Billie.
Hi, girls!

12:44.200 --> 12:46.600
Jesus, where did they come from?
Was that magic?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.233
Billie, aren't you gonna be late
for your 10:00 o'clock class?

12:49.233 --> 12:52.467
Oh, um, well, it's actually not
for ten minutes, but thank you.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.633
We can walk you over right now.

12:53.633 --> 12:56.233
We're on our way to... science.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.467
That sounds made up.
Ssh.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.833
What can we bring to the party
tomorrow night?

13:00.833 --> 13:01.833
Condoms!
Shh!

13:01.833 --> 13:03.167
No one talk, all right?

13:03.167 --> 13:04.533
Although, we should bring
condoms.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.667
I don't want to run
into that situation.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.133
Um, so...

13:08.133 --> 13:09.500
Tell them.
Okay.

13:09.500 --> 13:13.067
Uh, turns out the party's...
cancelled.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.867
The truth, Billie.

13:15.867 --> 13:18.500
All right, the Septeth
Circle Ceremony...

13:18.500 --> 13:20.900
is for sisters only, so--

13:20.900 --> 13:22.400
Isn't the Septeth Circle
a ritual...

13:22.400 --> 13:23.733
from the Teal Planets of Gnar?

13:23.733 --> 13:25.567
Oh, I don't--
( HISSING )

13:25.567 --> 13:28.100
Billie, you dropped something...
our friendship!

13:28.100 --> 13:29.267
She can't hear me.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.967
You guys are terrible
with women.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.333
And why aren't we all wearing
our robes?

13:34.100 --> 13:37.267
Okay, explain it to me one more
time, as if I was stupid.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.800
But just to be very clear,
I'm super big-brained.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.300
It's a science fiction fantasy
series by Grace Jones--

13:43.300 --> 13:45.067
Oh... Strang-ay!

13:45.067 --> 13:47.500
Billie and I like to invoke her
all the time.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.567
Different Grace Jones.
Oh.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.400
That takes place on the planet
of Gnar...

13:51.400 --> 13:54.200
where the Omega Sisterhood
ritualistically sacrifices...

13:54.200 --> 13:56.900
one virgin every year
to remain chaste.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.967
I read it every summer
while my parents are in Cabo.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.200
A bunch of prostitutes kind
of turned it into this...

14:01.200 --> 14:03.700
"born-again virgin" religious
movement in the 70's.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.933
It was real weird.

14:04.933 --> 14:06.733
Whoa... pictures.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.067
Where did it start?

14:08.067 --> 14:09.467
It looks like they started
at the breasts...

14:09.467 --> 14:10.733
because there's a lot
of attention to detail.

14:10.733 --> 14:12.500
Not the picture, Gene.
Yeah, I know.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.967
It started here.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.700
Should we call the police?

14:15.700 --> 14:18.233
Yeah, I mean, they're not gonna
actually sacrifice somebody.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.767
I mean, if they are, it feels
like a college campus...

14:20.767 --> 14:23.133
is a stupid place to look
for a virgin.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.400
Huh-huh... yeah.
Right, yeah, no.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.367
That's true.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.633

Wear this.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.867
Oh... that's pretty.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.967
Um... could I have a moment
to change alone...

14:42.967 --> 14:44.933
or maybe just a larger shirt
to change under?

14:44.933 --> 14:48.667
Drink.
Okay... more Quiet Time?

14:48.667 --> 14:49.800
Okay.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.600
Okay... gulp, gulp, gul--

14:52.600 --> 14:53.833

No, no, no, no--
Oh--

14:56.433 --> 14:58.467

15:00.633 --> 15:02.467

15:33.867 --> 15:36.200
Wow. I thought you knew her.

a good wordsmith?

is in danger...

about it.
