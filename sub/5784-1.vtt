14:28.869 --> 14:31.169
(Brackenreid): Who?
A few months ago,

14:31.171 --> 14:33.204
a couple of men came
asking after him.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.040
I told them what I told you.
Uh...

14:36.042 --> 14:39.110
was one of them this man?

14:39.112 --> 14:41.079
Yes, that's him.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.848
What about the other man?

14:43.850 --> 14:46.818
I never got
a good look at him.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.953
I didn't know
they were soldiers.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.256
♪

14:51.258 --> 14:53.591
Do you think
they know something?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.627
Do you think Douglas is alive?

14:55.629 --> 14:57.595
I'm sorry, ma'am,

14:57.597 --> 14:59.864
but we don't know
what happened to your husband.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.538
♪

15:17.316 --> 15:19.584
I saw you nodding
at that detective

15:19.586 --> 15:21.619
like you were
telling him something.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.222
We used to work together.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.458
Well, you might
want to be careful,

15:27.460 --> 15:29.460
otherwise people think
you're a rat.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.597
He doesn't need my help.
If he found the murder weapon,

15:32.599 --> 15:34.599
he'll find fingermarks.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.235
Not if they've been wiped.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.971
How long have you
been in here?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.840
Detective Murdoch
invented a technique

15:42.842 --> 15:45.276
to find fingermarks even after
they've been wiped off.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.111
Really?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.981
He rubs a compound on it, puts
it under some special light;

15:49.983 --> 15:52.083
the fingermarks glow red.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.552
Red?
Something to remember

15:54.554 --> 15:56.654
when you get out of here.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.623
Mark my words. As soon
as he matches the fingermark,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.491
he'll make an arrest.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.361
Now, do you care
to make a wager on who?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.330
For money?

16:05.332 --> 16:08.766
Yes, for money.
I'm gonna take odds.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.835
On who killed Foster?

16:10.837 --> 16:13.638
If you pass it around,
I'll cut you in.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.873
Only, tell the right people.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.409
We don't want the guards
getting wind of this.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.945
(clicking tongue)

16:20.947 --> 16:24.248
(indistinct talking)
(laughter)

16:24.250 --> 16:27.452
(Julia Ogden): <i>Are you</i>
<i>coming to bed, William?</i>
<i>(Murdoch):</i> <i>In just a moment.</i>

16:27.454 --> 16:30.021
What has you so engrossed?

16:30.023 --> 16:33.858
An unusual coincidence.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.494
Archibald Brooks was
reported killed in battle

16:36.496 --> 16:38.763
the day before Douglas Roper

16:38.765 --> 16:41.065
was declared a deserter.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.634
Did the two men
know each other?

16:43.636 --> 16:47.405
Impossible to say, but
they were in the same battle.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.507
How did the army know
that Mr. Roper

16:49.509 --> 16:52.377
wasn't just missing in action?
His identification tags

16:52.379 --> 16:56.114
were found in a hotel
in Johannesburg.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.449
So, a dead man comes to life,

16:58.451 --> 17:02.120
and a presumably living man
disappears without a trace.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.989
Curious turn of events, no?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.027
(guard): Alright,
you're relieved.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.029
10 to 1?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.164
You don't think
I'm capable of murder?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.733
OK, 5 to 1,
you feel better?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.603
What's your game?
I'm just looking

17:18.605 --> 17:21.172
for a way to pass the time.
But you're not on the board.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.241
I didn't kill the guy.
Come on, Lester,

17:23.243 --> 17:26.177
it's just a harmless bit of fun.
What you getting out of it?

17:26.179 --> 17:29.113
We're splitting the spread.
What's my cut?

17:31.016 --> 17:34.085
We'll cut you in
for half again for
every bet you bring in.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.990
(Lester scoffs.)

17:47.066 --> 17:49.067
Pearson.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.302
Pearson's going
at 10 to 1;

17:51.304 --> 17:53.304
Franklin might be
a better value.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.706
Pearson.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.376
Pearson it is.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.515
You're thinking
that Archie Brooks

18:04.517 --> 18:07.118
switched identities with
this Douglas Roper character.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.387
It would explain
Brooks' unlikely resurrection

18:09.389 --> 18:11.389
and Roper's disappearance.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.758
Being dead has its advantages.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.594
Especially if you're
the only one who knows.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.397
His mates didn't know.
They came looking for Roper.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.999
Perhaps they were
confirming a suspicion.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.836
You think they were
really after Brooks?

18:24.838 --> 18:27.138
Foster was asking
George about Edna.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.140
Could she be
mixed up in this?

18:29.142 --> 18:32.243
Someone was looking
for something in her apartment.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.481
Sir, why do you think

18:36.483 --> 18:40.418
Brooks wandered into
a back alley after he was shot?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.386
(Brackenreid):
<i>Looking for help, I imagine.</i>

18:42.388 --> 18:45.256
(Murdoch): <i>Why not</i>
<i>go out the front door?</i>
<i>More likely to find people.</i>

18:45.258 --> 18:47.258
(Brackenreid): <i>Not everyone</i>
<i>thinks as straight as you.</i>

18:47.260 --> 18:49.660
(Murdoch): <i>No, sir.</i>

18:49.662 --> 18:52.864
<i>No single act</i>
<i>is undertaken without a reason.</i>

18:55.000 --> 18:57.268
<i>Archibald Brooks was shot.</i>

18:57.270 --> 18:59.804
<i>But he was a soldier,</i>
<i>he would have surmised</i>

18:59.806 --> 19:01.839
<i>that he was in mortal danger.</i>

19:01.841 --> 19:04.509
<i>Yet, he chose to wander</i>
<i>into a back alley</i>

19:04.511 --> 19:07.845
<i>in the dead of winter</i>
<i>instead of seeking help.</i>

19:10.516 --> 19:12.884
<i>What was he after?</i>

19:37.743 --> 19:39.744
How do you know that?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.679
Location of the wound.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.148
Your head was turned
when the pipe hit you.

19:44.150 --> 19:47.118
You think it was a pipe?

19:47.120 --> 19:50.087
If it had an edge, I might be
doing this on the morgue table.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.490
(Murdoch exclaiming in pain)

19:52.492 --> 19:54.659
That's what you get
for skulking around

19:54.661 --> 19:57.695
a deserted alley
all by yourself.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.165
Well, I found out what Foster
and his partner were after.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.934
A raw diamond?

20:02.936 --> 20:05.736
This case does have
its roots in South Africa.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.738
And not just South Africa.
The bloody Boer War.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.740
This could be war booty.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.742
However it came to be,

20:11.744 --> 20:15.046
if Archibald Brooks came
into possession of this diamond,

20:15.048 --> 20:17.815
swapping identities with Douglas
would provide him

20:17.817 --> 20:19.917
with the opportunity
to flee with it.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.186
And how did Foster and
his partner find out about it?

20:22.188 --> 20:26.257
Well, sir, perhaps the diamond
was hidden by all three of them.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.026
They made a pact
to retrieve it together.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.829
Yes. But Brooks had
the opportunity to retrieve it

20:31.831 --> 20:34.398
for himself. The other two,
believing he was dead,

20:34.400 --> 20:37.702
return to the hiding spot
but found the diamond gone.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.471
So, they think back and
they put two and two together.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.640
Hence the visit
to Mrs. Roper.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.775
(indistinct chatter)

20:44.777 --> 20:48.212
You think Archibald Brooks'
army buddies killed him?

20:48.214 --> 20:51.349
It's a version
of the events

20:51.351 --> 20:53.484
that's consistent
with the facts.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.520
It certainly would
explain a lot.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.123
But we need to know
if it's consistent

20:59.125 --> 21:01.492
with what you know
to be true.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.429
It is.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.431
(Murdoch sighs.)

21:07.433 --> 21:09.433
You have to tell me, George.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.435
I need to hear it from you.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.505
Did you kill
Archibald Brooks?

21:14.507 --> 21:18.142
No, sir, I did not.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.878
But you thought Edna did.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.080
Now, why would you think--?
Sir, I bought her the gun.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.116
I showed her how to use it.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.485
I may as well have
pulled the trigger myself.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.855
You have to tell me
where she is.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.159
(knocking on a door)

21:40.699 --> 21:44.335
(George): <i>You remember I was</i>
<i>upset the night of the stakeout?</i>

21:44.337 --> 21:46.771
Yes. Of course,
I remember.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.839
You had been to her place,
to Edna's.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.743
But I went by way
of the back alley in case

21:52.745 --> 21:56.480
Archibald Brooks was home.
And you discovered his body.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.517
<i>Archibald had come home,</i>

21:59.519 --> 22:01.519
drunk and belligerent.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.554
Did he hit you?

22:03.556 --> 22:06.290
I stayed out of his way.

22:06.292 --> 22:09.260
I waited until he fell asleep,
and then I left.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.462
Where to?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.464
I-I wanted to...

22:13.466 --> 22:16.500
rent a room in the Junction
for Simon and I.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.603
I had enough money
for a week, but...

22:19.605 --> 22:22.039
I hadn't gone five blocks
when I remembered

22:22.041 --> 22:25.576
that I'd left the money
in the apartment.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.478
So you went back.
Yes,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.348
and Archie was gone.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.084
I was relieved.

22:33.086 --> 22:36.087
And then I saw the blood.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.155
And then I saw the gun.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.157
Ah, the gun! I didn't want

22:40.159 --> 22:42.660
to leave her without
any kind of protection.

22:42.662 --> 22:46.397
I... I kept it at the back
of the kitchen drawer.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.165
But that's not
where you found it.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.335
It was on the table.

22:51.337 --> 22:55.039
I picked it up.
It was still warm.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.908
And that's when George came in.

23:00.479 --> 23:03.347
<i>She's standing there,</i>
<i>holding the gun.</i>

23:03.349 --> 23:05.816
<i>I walked up to her.</i>

23:05.818 --> 23:08.386
<i>I didn't even notice</i>
<i>the blood that I'd stepped in.</i>

23:08.388 --> 23:11.822
He told me that the police
would be here soon,

23:11.824 --> 23:15.526
and that they'd want to speak to
me, and that I had to leave now.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.529
I told her to collect Simon
and go to an address

23:18.531 --> 23:20.765
that I'd given her
where I knew she'd be safe.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.868
And he told me to never
try to contact him,

23:23.870 --> 23:25.870
no matter what.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.773
You thought
George killed your husband.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.909
Of course I did.
Do you think

23:31.911 --> 23:36.113
that I would have let him
take the blame if I didn't?

23:36.115 --> 23:38.215
I loved him.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.284
I still do.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.089
They both thought
the other one did it.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.124
And bloody Crabtree wiped
the fingermarks that could

23:47.126 --> 23:49.126
have proven them both innocent.
Indeed.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.763
So what now?
We go back to the evidence.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.765
What's that?

23:54.767 --> 23:57.234
It's a scarf found
on Mr. Brooks' body.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.670
No doubt he used it
to staunch the blood.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.440
What else have we got?

24:02.442 --> 24:05.776
Not much, I'm afraid.
(phone ringing)

24:08.613 --> 24:10.614
Detective Murdoch.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.616
I don't have much.
I've confirmed

24:12.618 --> 24:15.052
the blade you found
was the murder weapon.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.556
The stab was an underhand
thrust. No defensive wounds.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.624
So, the victim
wasn't expecting it.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.827
Based on the angle of entry,
I've estimated

24:22.829 --> 24:25.796
the killer was several inches
taller than the victim.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.833
(indistinct chatter)

24:28.835 --> 24:30.968
Edna!
George!

24:30.970 --> 24:33.437
Step back!

24:33.439 --> 24:37.341
You got five minutes.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.143
I can't believe you did this.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.212
I can't believe you'd think
that I could let you.

24:41.214 --> 24:44.381
How is Simon?
I don't know.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.417
He's not living with me.

24:46.419 --> 24:48.419
He thinks that I killed
his father.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.421
Did he say that?

24:50.423 --> 24:54.325
Not in so many words.
What do we do?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.961
We find the man who killed
Foster. He's in here somewhere.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.963
How will that help?
He was likely hired

24:58.965 --> 25:01.732
by Foster's partner,
and one of the two of them

25:01.734 --> 25:04.468
killed your husband.
I'm sure of it.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.303
(indistinct chatter)
You got

25:06.305 --> 25:08.672
the inmates to bet
on who the killer is?

25:08.674 --> 25:11.642
It won't stand up in court
of course, but I'm sure you can

25:11.644 --> 25:15.246
extract a confession
once the suspect is identified.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.748
And do you have a suspect?
We believe so.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.851
A man named Carter
got the most bets,

25:20.853 --> 25:23.487
but that was expected
due to his thuggish reputation.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.489
The trick was to measure
the deviation

25:25.491 --> 25:28.359
between the expected
and the empirical results.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.428
There was an anomaly.
Pearson.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.431
Everyone who bet on him was
in the yard at the time
of the murder.

25:34.433 --> 25:38.235
And none of those men could be
persuaded to change their bets.

25:40.338 --> 25:43.307
Thank you.

25:43.309 --> 25:46.143
Mr. Pearson!

25:46.145 --> 25:48.879
I don't have
to talk to you.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.783
That matters little to me.
The evidence speaks for itself.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.852

<i>Perhaps, they always were.</i>

41:08.033 --> 41:10.900
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>what you did for us.</i>

41:10.902 --> 41:13.269
<i>Please forgive my doing</i>
<i>what I must.</i>

41:13.271 --> 41:16.439
<i>I love you</i>
<i>and I will miss you always.</i>

41:22.513 --> 41:24.714
So when Edna heard
Simo

41:24.716 --> 41:27.517
she knew he was the killer.

41:27.519 --> 41:29.686
Are you going after them?

41:29.688 --> 41:32.655
Bulletins have been sent out,
but that's the extent of it.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.691
So you won't pursue them.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.926
If information comes to us,
we'll investigate,

41:36.928 --> 41:39.896
but no one's burning
to see a boy hang

41:39.898 --> 41:41.898
for shooting his father.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.202
Likely in self-defence.
Exactly.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.905
But you did it, William.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.007
You freed George.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.142
You're a hero.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.311
(both chuckling)

41:57.248 --> 42:00.416
♪

42:19.737 --> 42:21.738
I heard what happened.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.773
I'm sorry.

42:23.775 --> 42:26.509
Wasn't meant to be,
I suppose.

42:28.913 --> 42:32.482
I just hope they're alright.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.788
You did everything
you could for them, George.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.924
More than any man would.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.560
You were prepared
to give them your life.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.628
And now you have yours back.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.666
When do you leave?

42:52.603 --> 42:54.671
Dr. Ogden told me
you were going to England.

42:56.707 --> 42:59.275
Three weeks and a day.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.312
You're counting down.
It's a good sign.

43:02.314 --> 43:05.014
Means you want to go.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.351
I do.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.789
Well...

43:12.791 --> 43:14.891
to new beginnings then.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.226
New beginnings.

43:33.143 --> 43:36.145
