00:08.742 --> 00:11.612
THANKS TO A CERTAIN
CITY COUNCILPERSON...

00:11.645 --> 00:14.014
ME... CHRISTMAS COMES
EARLY THIS YEAR:

00:14.048 --> 00:16.250
THREE NEW ELECTRIC BUSES
FOR THE CITY OF TOLEDO.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.651
NOT ONLY ARE THEY GREEN,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.653
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE
THAT NEW BUS SMELL.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.023
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?
THEY KNOW I LIKE

00:23.057 --> 00:24.392
A LITTLE APPLAUSE
WHEN I GET HOME.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.394
BIG SCHOOL PROJECT.
RYDER IS UPSTAIRS

00:26.427 --> 00:28.129
BAGGING UP OLD BEDDING
TO SEND TO HAITI,

00:28.162 --> 00:30.631
LENNOX IS OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
COLLECTING SHOES TO SEND TO HAITI

00:30.664 --> 00:33.567
AND I AM STUFFING ENVELOPES ASKING
FOR CLOTHES TO SEND TO HAITI.

00:33.601 --> 00:37.138
IT'S ALL ABOUT TO HAITI.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.473
DON'T LEAVE ME OUT. WHAT
CAN I DO FOR HAITI?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.509
LICK THIS.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.614
I GOT IT ALL COVERED. I SET UP THE PHONE
TREE, SET UP THE COLLECTION POINTS,

00:46.647 --> 00:48.782
EVEN GOT THE CHICK AT THE MAIL
SHOP TO DONATE FREE SHIPPING.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.320
- SHE DIGS ME.
- SHE'S 80.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.355
YEAH, SHE'S ALSO VERY HANDSY.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.024
THESE JEANS, THEY'RE
LIKE CATNIP FOR HER.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.760
I ALSO HELPED RYDER OUT WITH
HIS AMERICAN HISTORY PROJECT

00:59.793 --> 01:01.762
AND I HELPED LENNOX OUT
WITH HER SCIENCE MODEL.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.431
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE, A HERO?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.233
NO, I TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING IN THE HOME

01:05.266 --> 01:08.369
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF THE
300,000 PEOPLE OF TOLEDO.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.571
THAT IS THE DIVISION OF
LABOR IN THIS HOUSE.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.406
YEAH, BUT WE COULD
SWITCH IT UP, YOU KNOW?

01:12.440 --> 01:15.209
LIKE, SAY, SOMETIME
I COULD COOK.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.445
OKAY, THAT SOUNDED
CRAZY EVEN TO ME.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.447
BUT I DON'T LIKE FEELING
LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.416
TOMORROW I AM GOING TO DRIVE THE KIDS
TO SCHOOL AND FIND OUT FIRSTHAND

01:22.450 --> 01:23.817
WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER AT GRANT HIGH.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.419
YOU'D BETTER BRING
YOUR BOLT CUTTERS

01:25.453 --> 01:27.455
IF YOU WANNA GET IN BECAUSE
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.823

( pants )

01:53.214 --> 01:58.152
AND THAT, MY DEAR
BOY, IS THE HUSTLE.

01:58.186 --> 02:01.455
ALL I SAID WAS, "I WONDER IF
THEY STILL MAKE VINYL RECORDS?"

02:01.489 --> 02:04.558
I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF US
DESERVED TO GO THROUGH THAT.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.661
WELL...

02:07.695 --> 02:11.799
THAT WAS THE MOST SUPREMELY
CRAPPY DAY OF MY LIFE.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.367
OH, WHAT WAS IT, HONEY?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.336
A ZIT OR A CRAMP OR
A GUY IGNORED YOU?

02:15.369 --> 02:16.737
'CAUSE I HAD ALL THREE.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.740
OKAY, CAN WE STAY ON ME?
BECAUSE I GOT A "D."

02:19.773 --> 02:22.543
MY ENGLISH TEACHER MR.
SKIMPOLE GAVE IT TO ME.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.445
HE IS SUCH A COLOSSAL TOOL.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.480
LENNOX, IT'S DISRESPECTFUL
TO CALL YOUR TEACHER A TOOL.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.881
NO, IT'S A KNOWN FACT.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.784
HE'S THE TOOL THAT THE
OTHER TOOLS MAKE FUN OF.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.622
THE ASSIGNMENT WAS TO WRITE A
SAMPLE CHAPTER FOR A NOVEL

02:34.655 --> 02:36.890
AND MR. SKIMPOLE
EVISCERATED MINE.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.160
HE SAID THERE IS NO WAY IT COULD
BE TURNED INTO A 200-PAGE NOVEL.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.197
HE SAID I HAVE NO SENSE OF CHARACTER
DEVELOPMENT OR STORY STRUCTURE.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.767
- WHAT KIND OF EDUCATOR IS THAT?
- THE TOOL KIND.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.469
AND I TOLD HIM IT
COULD SO BE A NOVEL

02:48.502 --> 02:50.604
- AND I COULD WRITE IT TOO.
- ABSOLUTELY.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.506
YOU NEED TO STAND UP TO
NAY SAYERS LIKE THAT.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.208
WHEN I WAS GONNA RUN
FOR CITY COUNCIL,

02:54.242 --> 02:55.409
THEY TOLD ME I WAS TOO YOUNG,

02:55.443 --> 02:57.511
I WAS TOO GREEN, I
WAS TOO BLONDE.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.681
- BUT DID YOU
- OH, BUT I SHOWED THEM.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.683
YEAH, AND YOU CAN SHOW
THAT TOOL MR. SKIMPOLE.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.353
HELL YEAH. I'M GONNA
WRITE THAT NOVEL.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.455
I HAVE, LIKE, A WHOLE
WEEK AND A HALF.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.856
A WEEK AND A WHAT?

03:08.889 --> 03:12.226
A WEEK AND A HALF UNTIL
THE GRADING PERIOD ENDS.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.595
I MEAN IF I TURN IN AN
ENTIRE BRILLIANT NOVEL,

03:14.628 --> 03:16.364
HE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE MY GRADE.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.199
- I'M GONNA GET STARTED.
- ATTAGIRL.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.802
WOW, 10 DAYS TO WRITE
A WHOLE NOVEL?

03:21.835 --> 03:25.306
- SHE'S OUT OF HER MIND.
- I KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.276
HEY, YOU'RE A BIG FAN
OF MY TRI-TIP, RIGHT?

03:28.309 --> 03:29.810
- OH, I LOVE IT.
- THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.745
I DIDN'T MAKE ANY
OF THAT TONIGHT.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.214
WHAT I DO HAVE YOU
COULD REHEAT, OKAY? EN

03:34.248 --> 03:35.616

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH

WELL, ALL THOSE LADIES WERE TREATING
ME LIKE A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN

07:03.423 --> 07:04.792
BECAUSE I'M NOT
TECHNICALLY A MOM

07:04.825 --> 07:06.694
AND I HAVEN'T TECHNICALLY BEEN

07:06.727 --> 07:08.962

OOH, A RUMBA. LET'S DANCE.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.031

WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

08:18.065 --> 08:20.033
FOR ME TO DANCE WITH MY OWNER.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.203

WRITING A NOVEL IN 10 DAYS IS
A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.098
NO, LENNOX, YOU CANNOT
LET SKIMPOLE WIN.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.266
I ALREADY TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS

YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M EDITING

09:02.676 --> 09:04.612
MY DIGITAL FILMS I

QUENTIN TARANTINO, TYLER PERRY.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.219
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE THE SCENES OR
PLOT POINTS AND YOU WRITE THEM ON A CARD

09:12.252 --> 09:14.755
AND THEN PUT THEM ON A BULLETIN
BOARD AND MOVE THEM AROUND.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.525

CREATIVELY CONSTIPATED.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.907

12:36.256 --> 12:38.158
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD ME?
TRISHA'S GOT FOUR KIDS.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.427

12:40.460 --> 12:42.229
YOU KNOW, RYDER AND LENNOX?

12:42.262 --> 12:45.799
WELL, RYDER AND LENNOX DON'T YELL
"WIPE ME" FROM THE BATHROOM.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.200
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.369
YOU'LL BE FABULOUS WITH THE KIDS.
JUST BE PREPARED.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.304
SO WHAT SHOULD I DO? BRING SOME
FINGERPAINTS AND A PUZZLE?

12:51.338 --> 12:52.505
SURE, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

12:52.539 --> 12:55.042
TRY A JUICE BOX
FILLED WITH VODKA.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.877

OF COURSE NOT. THE
VODKA'S FOR YOU.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.349
YOU BRING DUCT
TAPE FOR THE KIDS.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.385

GREAT MOM SOMEDAY.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.256
( doorbell rings )

13:09.289 --> 13:13.260

TOY STORE ON MY WAY HERE.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.298
I HOPE YOUR KIDS LIKE KERPLUNK.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.234
OH, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
I GOT MY DAYS MIXED UP.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.536
THIS IS THE WEEKEND THE KIDS
SPEND WITH THEIR FATHER.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.338
OH, OKAY.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.240
SO YOU HAVE A DATE COMING
OVER OR SOMETHING?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.942
BECAUSE I'LL JUST
COOK FOR YOU TWO.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.844
WHATEVER'S LEFTOVER YOU CAN
JUST FREEZE FOR THE KIDS.

13:30.878 --> 13:34.047
SORRY TO SAY, IT'S JUST ME.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.449
OH.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.986
WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE KERPLUNK.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.222
THIS IS KIND OF A CHANGE.
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

13:42.255 --> 13:45.092
WELL, LET'S START WITH DINNER

13:45.125 --> 13:48.395
AND THEN SEE WHERE
THE NIGHT TAKES US.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.566
THESE JEANS ARE JUST DEADLY.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.539
( ringing )

13:59.572 --> 14:01.841
- JOE, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- YEAH YEAH, IT'S FINE.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.843
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
CALLING TO CHECK IN

14:03.877 --> 14:05.245
JUST TO SEE IF YOU
WERE TIRED OF IT.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.547
- TIRED OF WHAT?
- BEING WRONG.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.382
YOU SAID TONIGHT WAS
GONNA GO GREAT.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.884
WHY? DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO THE KIDS?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.252
WOULDN'T KNOW. THE
KIDS AREN'T HERE.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.386
OH MY GOD, DID YOU
LOSE THEM ALREADY?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.555
NO, I DID NOT LOSE THE KIDS.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.290
NO, IT'S JUST ME AND TRISH HERE

14:17.324 --> 14:19.259
IN HER LOVE LAIR.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.294
APPARENTLY SHE THOUGHT
THE JOE LONGO PACKAGE

14:21.328 --> 14:25.398
INCLUDES JOE LONGO'S PACKAGE.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.001
WHAT? WELL, GET OUT OF THERE.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.337
OH, I SEE. NOW YOU CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME, HUH?

14:30.370 --> 14:34.374
Trisha: JOSEPH, IT'S JUST ME
AND THE PORK LOIN OVER HERE.

14:34.407 --> 14:38.278
AND ONE OF US NEEDS
A NICE SPICY RUB.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.985
SHE PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS.
I GOTTA GO.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.388
JOE. JOE! DON'T DO IT!

14:54.327 --> 14:57.397
THE CLIMAX... WHERE
IS THE CLIMAX?

14:57.430 --> 15:00.400
OH OKAY!

15:00.433 --> 15:02.936
MARTINE DISCOVERS
THAT HER MOTHER

15:02.970 --> 15:05.172
IS IN FACT HER FATHER.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.873
NO NO!

15:06.906 --> 15:09.576
THAT SHOULD COME AT THE
END OF CHAPTER 10.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.379
IT'LL NEVER WORK, MISS SCANLON.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.482
MR. SKIMPOLE? HOW DID
YOU GET IN HERE?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.518
PFFT, BACKSTORY. NOBODY CARES.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.554
AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A GRIPPING OPENING SENTENCE.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.125
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I HAVE
MANY GRIPPING SENTENCES.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.527
WHAT, HERE? OR HERE?

15:27.560 --> 15:30.563
CERTAINLY NOT HERE.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.632
FACE IT, MISS SCANLON,
YOU'RE A FAILURE.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.302
YOU'LL NEVER BE A
REAL WRITER, NEVER.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.104
WHAT? NO! BUT I HAVE TO.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.373
( laughing )

15:40.407 --> 15:44.011
EVEN YOUR NIGHTMARE MATERIAL
IS DESPERATELY BANAL.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.213
- OH!
- LENNOX?

15:46.246 --> 15:51.218
- WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?
- MR. SKIMPOLE. HE WAS HERE.

15:51.251 --> 15:55.055
LENNOX, YOU HAVE A COUGH
DROP IN YOUR HAIR.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.992
I GIVE UP. I CAN'T DO THIS.

15:59.026 --> 16:02.595
NO NO. NO, LENNOX, YOU ARE
VERY TALENTED AND CREATIVE.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.632
YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE
HELP ORGANIZING.

16:05.665 --> 16:09.502
SO WHAT HAPPENS FIRST? DOES
MARTINE BEHEAD THE VAMPIRE

16:09.536 --> 16:13.506
OR DO THE SKINNY HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLS EAT THEIR CLASSMATES?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.142
I DON'T KNOW.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.677
YES, YOU DO, LENNOX. DIG DEEP.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.981
OKAY, UH, SKINNY GIRLS
AND THEN THE VAMPIRE.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.017
OKAY.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.022
OH MY GOD, THAT WORKS.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.524
HA, TAKE THAT, MR. SKIMPOLE.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.461
- HEY, THANKS, RYDER.
- OH NO, DON'T THANK ME. THANK TYLER PERRY.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.265
OKAY, DINNER IS ALL SET.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.167
JUST NEEDS TO STAY IN THE BROILER
FOR LIKE 20 MORE MINUTES.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.402
A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN 20 MINUTES.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.738
CAN I TEMPT YOU...
WITH SOME WINE?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.275
NO. NOPE, NOT FOR ME,
NOT WHILE I'M WORKING.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.544
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE TONIGHT...
JUST DOING MY WORK.

16:51.578 --> 16:55.548
WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING I
WONDERED IF YOU COULD DO FOR ME...

16:58.251 --> 17:00.253
SOMETHING I NEED A MAN FOR.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.155
WOULD YOU CHANGE THAT
LIGHT BULB FOR ME?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.690
TRISH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DRAW THE LINE RIGHT HERE.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.093
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA...
CHANGE THE LIGHT BULB? YES.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.529
ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE. I'D
LOVE TO DO THAT, YEAH.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.997
THIS ONE. ALL RIGHT.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.399
YOU HAVE A LITTLE
STEPLADDER OR SOMETHING?

17:12.432 --> 17:13.666
YOU CAN JUST STAND ON THE CHAIR.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.269
YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T...
OKAY. FINE, SURE.

17:16.303 --> 17:20.073
WOW, LOOK AT YOU...
SUCH ANIMAL GRACE.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.242
( chuckles ) THANKS. YEAH.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.146
HERE, LET ME HOLD YOU
SO YOU DON'T FALL.

17:26.179 --> 17:29.316
- YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
- MM, YEAH.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.751
BUT WE CAN PRETEND
IT'S MY FIRST TIME.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.487
( both laugh )

17:34.521 --> 17:38.125
- ( doorbell rings )
- OH, WHO COULD THAT BE?

17:38.158 --> 17:41.694
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GONNA LIGHT
A CANDLE FOR WHOEVER THAT IS.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.164
- MEL BURKE.
- HI.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.399
MEL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:46.433 --> 17:49.169
- YES, WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
- OH, QUALITY CONTROL.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.438
JUST, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE
MY AUCTION DONATION PERSON

17:51.471 --> 17:53.673
IS BEING ENJOYED BY THE LUCKY
LADY WHO WON IT... HIM.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.742
AH, GREAT. COME HERE. LET
ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.744
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.546
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
CALLED ME IN A PANIC.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.813
I JUST CALLED TO
MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.615
CLEARLY I'VE DONE THAT,
SO I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.217
- GOOD NIGHT.
- WAIT. WAIT WAIT WAIT!

18:04.251 --> 18:07.154
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH HER?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.256
WHY DO YOU CARE?

18:09.289 --> 18:11.291
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOU TO, YOU KNOW,

18:11.324 --> 18:13.793
COMPROMISE YOUR VALUE
AS AN AUCTION ITEM.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.364
I THOUGHT I BOUGHT AN
EVENING WITH JOE LONGO,

18:17.397 --> 18:20.099
NOT JOE LONGO AND
HIS LITTLE KEEPER.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.636
HEY, OKAY, IT WAS A NIGHT WITH JOE
LONGO COOKING AND BABYSITTING.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.706
AND IF YOU TRY FOR ANYTHING THAT'S
GONNA SKANK THAT UP, HE'S OUT OF HERE.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.608
- MEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OKAY WELL, IF HE LEAVES,

18:28.641 --> 18:30.843
I'LL LET THE SCHOOL KNOW THAT
YOU RENEGED ON YOUR DONATION.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.313
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SCHOOL.
YOU'RE NEVER THERE.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.148
FRANKLY, I'LL QUESTION
YOUR COMMITMENT.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.150
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER
GIVEN GRANT HIGH?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.852
$1,100.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.154
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.822
YEAH, YOU BID $1,000 FOR HIM.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.824
I'M COUNTERING. $1,100.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.693
YOU CAN'T RESTART
THE BIDDING, MEL.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.861

21:08.335 --> 21:10.303
OKAY WELL, BECAUSE
I WAS SO TIRED

21:10.337 --> 21:12.305
AND RYDER WAS RUSHING
TO HELP ME FINISH,

21:12.339 --> 21:15.342
WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET ALL THE
POST-ITS OUT OF THE MANUSCRIPT

21:15.375 --> 21:17.910
AND SOME PAGES STILL HAD
NOTES WRITTEN IN THE MARGIN.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.579
AW MAN.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.980
MR. SKIMPOLE THOUGHT
THE POST-ITS

21:21.013 --> 21:22.715
WERE A BOLD STYLIST CHOICE.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.851
QUOTE, "THE AUTHOR'S
COMMENTS ON HER OWN WORK

21:24.884 --> 21:27.454
CREATED AN EXCITING
POSTMODERN VIBE."

21:27.487 --> 21:28.655
I GOT AN "A"!

21:28.688 --> 21:30.256
- OH!
- WHOO!

21:30.289 --> 21:32.459
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

21:32.492 --> 21:36.295
SO, LENNOX, TELL US, WHAT
IS YOUR NOVEL ABOUT?

21:36.329 --> 21:39.566
I DON'T EXPLAIN MY WORK.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.568
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.737
( theme music playing )
