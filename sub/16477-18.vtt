WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:08.509
You still haven't
kicked the habit.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.478
Ugh. Hey, I
can't help it.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.246
This sugary goodness
has gotten me through

00:12.280 --> 00:14.315
many hours of watch standing.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.387
God, I can't remember
the last time I had a soda.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.122
Or anything with flavor.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.423
Here.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.691
This round is on me.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.126
I shouldn't.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.328
Live a little, Lieutenant.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.837
You're a bad influence, Collins.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.706
(light rumbling)
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Code blue, room 311.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.442
Code blue, room 311.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.277
What's going on?

00:43.311 --> 00:44.578
(monitor beeping rapidly)

00:44.612 --> 00:46.414
Hold compressions.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.581
MAN: No pulse.
DOCTOR: Charge to 200 joules.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.049
MAN: Clear.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.452
No pulse.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.187
Continue CPR.

00:53.221 --> 00:56.590
I'm tired, Collins.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.859
I think it's time
for me to go.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.795
I can't let you do that
just yet, Lieutenant.

01:01.829 --> 01:05.499
You made me a
promise, remember?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.569
I do.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.705
I'll see you soon, Laura.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.613
Charge to 360.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.282
Clear.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.886
Got a pulse.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.822
Welcome back, Lieutenant.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.431
*

02:07.861 --> 02:09.930
BISHOP:
Thanks.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.365
I love you.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.900
So, what, you had a late night?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.368
(grunts)

02:14.402 --> 02:15.936
How do you expect
to run five miles

02:15.969 --> 02:17.705
when you can barely
keep your head up?

02:17.738 --> 02:20.574
My body's
a finely-tuned machine.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.310
Just needs
a little fuel.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.245
It sounds more like
you need a full tune-up.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.547
I got one last night.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
Ugh. There goes my appetite.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.185
Not mine.
Hey, you're, like,
20 minutes late.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.721
Oh, it's Sunday,
I'm lucky I'm here at all.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.890
Hey, excuse me,
can I have a western omelet

02:36.924 --> 02:38.592
with, um, some coffee?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.760
BISHOP:
What are you doing?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.495
We eat after the run,

02:41.529 --> 02:42.763
not before.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.532
Oh, can't we do both?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.866
The marathon is a
few months away

02:45.899 --> 02:47.201
and this is our first
training session.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.436
We need to get serious.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.538
Or wing it.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.640
That's what I did
in my last marathon.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.709
What was your time?
Shy of three hours.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.279
That's impossible.
Olympians barely do that.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.514
I know, right?
(chuckles)

03:00.548 --> 03:01.982
My body is this work of art,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.851
you know?
But it's also a blessing

03:03.884 --> 03:06.420
and a curse, McGee.
Just be grateful that,

03:06.454 --> 03:07.721
uh, you don't have to

03:07.755 --> 03:09.723
worry about something like that.
(chuckles)

03:09.757 --> 03:12.626
Anyway, why don't you two
go get a head start?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.862
We'll eat quick
and we'll catch up with you.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.332
Uh, what makes you think
McGee and I need a head start?
No, go, go.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.933
McGee...
We're wasting time, come on.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.471
(sighs)

03:23.504 --> 03:24.738
Help yourself.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.975
Mmm. You're very kind.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.444
Sorry to drop in on you
unannounced, Gunny.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.514
I know you hate surprises.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.616
Glad you did, General.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.585
How's retirement?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.920
(chuckles) Well, two years
out of the Corps,

03:39.953 --> 03:42.790
I still keep my room
inspection-ready.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.360
Civilian life
is an adjustment.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.728
Yeah.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.497
Yeah, I know the feeling.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.601
My daughter wants me to get a
new wardrobe, but... old habits.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.603
Laura still stationed
out of Norfolk?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.939
No. No, she's, uh...

03:58.972 --> 04:02.710
she's been in Maryland
these last few months.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.346
She's actually the reason
I came to see you, Gunny.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.782
She in some sort of trouble?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.685
Laura's dying, Jethro.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.288
We...

04:14.322 --> 04:16.324
we need your help.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.439
My dad tracked you down?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.474
Yes, he did.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.877
He wouldn't fill me in.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.414
He said that you wanted
to talk to me yourself.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.916
It's been a long time, Gibbs.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.420
It's probably not how you
remember me, is it?

04:46.454 --> 04:48.055
Well, you
probably forget

04:48.088 --> 04:49.923
I was the one who drove you
to the hospital after you

04:49.957 --> 04:52.760
crashed your bike into that
tree in front of my house.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.363
I still have that scar.
(chuckles)

04:55.396 --> 04:56.730
So does the tree.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.436
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.105
What-what's going on?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.975
I got back from deployment
ten months ago,

05:08.008 --> 05:10.110
couldn't shake this fatigue.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.447
Figured it was stress.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
I was wrong.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.521
How bad?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.922
Ovarian cancer.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.624
Advanced stage four.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.861
I always was an overachiever.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.598
What are your options?
I've been
to countless specialists,

05:30.631 --> 05:31.999
tried multiple treatments,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.602
nothing's working.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.637
The writing's on the wall.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.942
(sighs)

05:41.975 --> 05:44.344
Well, Laura, what
can I do to help?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.848
By getting me closure.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.620
Here you go.
Thank you.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.856
Before I got sick,
I was onboard the USS Gray.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.558
During our deployment,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.960
one of my sailors
was lost at sea.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.663
Petty Officer David Collins.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.098
We searched for days, but...

06:05.132 --> 06:07.435
he was never recovered.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.936
The official report

06:08.969 --> 06:12.540
said it was
an accidental man overboard.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.508
And you think
it was something else?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.977
Days before Collins
went missing, he...

06:17.010 --> 06:18.579
he showed up with a black eye,

06:18.612 --> 06:21.181
and he was acting strangely.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.517
Did Collins say what happened?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.118
He refused.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.688
Said he didn't
want to lie to me,

06:27.721 --> 06:29.990
but he couldn't
tell me the truth either.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.426
See, something was going on.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.863
Laura, it could be anything.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.667
My gut says his death
wasn't an accident.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.835
I started looking into it
and asking questions,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.872
but... then I got sick.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.981
I was Collins' division officer.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.684
It was my job
to look out for him

06:56.717 --> 06:58.719
and I failed.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.223
I made a promise
to find out what happened.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.459
I won't fail him again.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.428
Please.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.632
Gibbs, I need your help.

07:12.966 --> 07:13.967
I'm running out of time.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.648
Ooh, nothing like
an early-morning run

07:27.681 --> 07:28.882
to energize you,
am I right?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.685
Man, we crushed that last mile.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.086
You certainly perked up.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.655
Well, McGee and Bishop
got, like,

07:34.688 --> 07:36.189
a ten-minute start
and we still beat 'em.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.492
I mean, that's got to be
embarrassing.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.660
Yeah, we can hear you.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
You're speaking at full volume.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.263
Look, I tried to warn you guys,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.133
my body performs at, like,
a whole different level.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.968
You know what, it's, like,
unnatural. It was like

07:48.001 --> 07:50.103
trying to keep up with
Usain Bolt

07:50.137 --> 07:52.239
and Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.208
Okay, so, look, Torres and I are

07:55.242 --> 07:57.545
naturally gifted runners
and you two are not.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.812
Like, not at all.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.181
QUINN: But with hard work
and training,

08:01.214 --> 08:04.184
you can get better.
Hey, I believe in you.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.053
Me too.
Not that you can beat me,

08:06.086 --> 08:07.254
because that'll
never really happen.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.589
But at the very least,
you won't

08:08.622 --> 08:10.958
come in last.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.225
You really need to work on
your pep talk, Torres.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.961
GIBBS:
Give me an update.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.697
Petty Officer First Class
David Collins.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.232
27, unmarried, no kids.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.968
Joined the Navy
in 2008,

08:21.001 --> 08:22.536
quickly rose
through the ranks.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.837
BISHOP: Last year
he was serving

08:23.871 --> 08:25.205
onboard the USS Gray.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.107
They were patrolling
South American waters

08:27.140 --> 08:29.710
on a counter-narcotics mission
with the Coast Guard

08:29.743 --> 08:31.545
when he was lost at sea.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.746
McGEE: An immediate onboard
investigation was conducted

08:32.780 --> 08:34.582
by the ship's master-at-arms,

08:34.615 --> 08:37.117
Chief Michael Vinton.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.986
How long until NCIS got onboard?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.754
48 hours later.
I spoke with the agent

08:40.788 --> 08:42.823
from the southeast field office.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.958
He's sending over the evidence.
According to both
investigations,

08:44.992 --> 08:46.694
Collins was first
reported missing

08:46.727 --> 08:48.729
at 2:00 a.m.,
when he failed to, uh,

08:48.762 --> 08:51.131
show up to a bridge watch.
A broken stanchion

08:51.164 --> 08:53.133
was discovered
on the deck.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.002
Ship began
man-overboard maneuvers.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
They scoured the waters,
but found no trace

08:56.804 --> 08:58.872
of Collins.
BISHOP:
Evidence suggests

08:58.906 --> 09:01.141
he lost his balance
after the stanchion broke,

09:01.174 --> 09:03.276
causing him
to fall overboard undetected.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.212
Foul play wasn't suspected.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.947
It is now.
(phone rings)

09:06.980 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, Duck? I'm on my way,
I'll meet you there.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.022
MAN:
I'm sorry, uh,

09:15.055 --> 09:16.924
what is this about?
I thought NCIS

09:16.957 --> 09:18.826
already closed
the case on Collins.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.761
Well, we're just
following up on a few things.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.362
Yeah, we like
to be thorough.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.131
Roger that.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.766
What'd you want to know?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.601
Hoping you could run us
through what happened

09:27.635 --> 09:29.369
after Collins was
reported missing.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.139
I got a call
from the bridge at 0200

09:32.172 --> 09:33.974
that Collins
was a no-show.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.943
I pulled a few sailors
to help look for him.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.345
One of them discovered a broken
stanchion, here on the gun deck.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.181
Realizing that Collins
may have gone overboard,

09:41.214 --> 09:42.249
I notified the bridge,

09:42.282 --> 09:44.184
and sealed off
the area.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.719
Is this the one, right here?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.121
No, the other NCIS agent
took it as evidence.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.256
This is the replacement.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.260
Still feels pretty
unstable, though.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.329
That's because it's removable.
It's locked in place by a pin.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.866
When I arrived on the scene,
the stanchion was hanging over

09:58.899 --> 10:00.901
the side of the ship
by the lifeline.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.703
When's the window of time

10:02.736 --> 10:04.237
when Collins
could've gone overboard?

10:04.271 --> 10:07.240
Between 2300 and 0200 hours.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.342
Last person to see him alive?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.712
Petty Officer Nicole Trainer.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.213
She took his death pretty hard.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.748
The whole crew did.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.150
It's not easy to
lose one of your own.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.088
Thank you for taking
the time, Dr. Mallard.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.856
Gibbs says you're
the best of the best.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.158
I didn't know
NCIS had an oncologist.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.794
He's our
medical examiner.

10:26.827 --> 10:31.131
I know I might look it,
but I'm not dead yet.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.733
DUCKY: Uh, Jethro
told me about

10:32.766 --> 10:34.334
your unique sense of humor.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.736
He also asked me

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
for assistance

10:37.070 --> 10:40.007
as I know several specialists

10:40.040 --> 10:42.242
who are the best of the best.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.911
Do you think any of
them can help Laura?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.112
Dad,

10:45.145 --> 10:47.347
we've gone over this, okay?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.749
My prognosis

10:48.782 --> 10:50.751
is not going
to change.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.820
The treatments haven't worked.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.855
But one could.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.858
Laura, your dad's right--
you don't quit.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.392
DUCKY: I have
a colleague who runs

10:59.426 --> 11:01.361
an experimental
treatment program

11:01.394 --> 11:04.965
for advanced-stage
cancer patients.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.201
Has it proven
to be successful?

11:08.235 --> 11:11.805
Well, it's extended the
life expectancy of some

11:11.839 --> 11:14.207
by five, even ten years.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.843
Years?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.477
It's a limited
program,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.747
so he can only take

11:19.780 --> 11:21.414
a select number of patients.

11:21.448 --> 11:26.019
But, well, I would be happy
to make a call on your behalf.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.288
All you have to do

11:28.321 --> 11:30.724
is say the word.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.165
(exhales)

11:38.198 --> 11:41.234
What the hell?
It's worth a shot.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.736
(quietly):
Yeah.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.108
When did you leave the Navy,
Miss Trainer?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.143
Eight months ago,

11:50.177 --> 11:52.312
when my contract was up.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.048
After Collins died, I just...

11:55.082 --> 11:57.517
couldn't do it anymore.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.252
You two were close?

11:59.286 --> 12:03.056
We worked in the same division.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.193
He was like a big brother.

12:06.226 --> 12:10.130
Do you know why he went out on
the deck that night so late?

12:10.163 --> 12:13.834
Collins always went out there;
it was a place to relax.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.369
Was he acting differently
when you saw him?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.938
No.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.941
But it just...
doesn't make sense.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.877
Collins shouldn't have been
leaning on those stanchions.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.347
Do you think something
else might have happened?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.416
What do you mean?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.520
Like maybe it wasn't
an accident?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.488
But...

12:35.522 --> 12:37.991
it was an accident.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.060
Right?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.230
Collins was seen
with a black eye

12:43.263 --> 12:45.232
days before he
went missing.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.167
Do you know
how he got it?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.837
Yeah, I was with him
when it happened.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.372
We were at a port stop
in Panama.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.542
We were at a bar,
and another sailor punched him.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.078
Petty Officer Holden Baxter.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.213
He was my boyfriend.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.582
What was the fight about?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.451
Baxter got drunk,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.987
he started yelling at me,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.589
and then when
Collins intervened,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.458
Baxter just lost it.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.295
He just never liked
that we were friends.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.997
I broke up with him right after.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.966
How did Baxter take that?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.868
Didn't seem to mind.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.270
Started dating someone else
the next day.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.306
Are you still in contact
with this Prince Charming?

13:26.339 --> 13:29.376
No, I haven't seen him
or spoken to him

13:29.409 --> 13:31.979
since I left the ship.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.847
(chuckles)
For sure.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.482
Holden Baxter?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.018
Who's asking?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.019
NCIS.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.453
(chuckles)

13:40.487 --> 13:42.489
Should have figured
with those clothes.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.457
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.226
That's a good one.
You know, Nicole Trainer,

13:46.259 --> 13:47.460
uh, didn't say
you were funny.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.396
How did she describe
him again?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.164
As a, uh, "self-serving,

13:51.198 --> 13:53.533
arrogant D-bag who only
cares about himself."

13:53.566 --> 13:55.435
Oh, yeah, that was it.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.871
Sounds like sour grapes.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.473
Nicole knows I was the best
thing that ever happened to her.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.342
She also mentioned
that you were the one

14:02.375 --> 14:04.444
that gave Petty Officer Collins
a black eye.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.581
Hey, what's the matter?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.918
Can't stand a lot
of competition?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.220
McGEE: Oh, I don't think
there's really any
competition there.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.088
Collins was smarter...

14:15.122 --> 14:17.891
more successful,
better liked by the crew.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.093
You think I give a damn?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.062
I think it
drove you crazy.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.198
Collins had them all fooled,
but not me-- I knew the truth.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.068
Which is what?
Everyone thought he was
some sort of golden boy,

14:28.101 --> 14:30.437
but he was breaking more rules
than anyone.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.439
But I'm no snitch.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.075
Well, he's dead.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.345
So I'm sure
he won't mind.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.947
He had a thing going

14:39.980 --> 14:41.514
with his division officer,
Lieutenant Ellison.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.351
Officers aren't permitted
to date enlisted.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.619
Which is why
they kept it a secret

14:46.653 --> 14:49.622
and I kept my mouth shut,
'cause I'm a stand-up guy.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.959
You should get
a medal for that.
Damn right.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.927
Lieutenant Ellison
made my life miserable.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.329
She had it in for me
from day one.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.631
She's lucky I was so forgiving.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.069
(chuckles) The more you
talk, the worse it gets.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.337
Where were you
between 2300 and 0200 hours

15:04.371 --> 15:07.140
the night that Petty Officer
Collins went missing?

15:07.174 --> 15:09.142
On mid-watch in engineering.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.443
Lots of witnesses.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.079
Ask around.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.114
We'll do that.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.052
Abbs, I got your message.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.620
Gibbs, I have been waiting.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.655
And all his forgiven.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.558
So, I processed the evidence
that the NCIS agent collected

15:25.592 --> 15:29.029
from the USS Gray last year,
and I hit the mother lode.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.131
The theory was that
Petty Officer Collins

15:31.164 --> 15:33.066
leaned on this stanchion,
which broke

15:33.100 --> 15:35.035
and caused him
to fall overboard.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.436
I already knew that.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.571
W-Well, get ready
for something that you didn't.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.673
I analyzed the inner wires

15:40.707 --> 15:43.243
of this lifeline cable,
and I found blood.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.745
And not just anyone's blood.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.148
Petty Officer Collins' blood.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.350
Well, he could've injured
himself when he fell overboard.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.152
Blood doesn't mean anything.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.753
No. But...

15:53.786 --> 15:56.689
sodium hypochlorite does.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.025
What?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.559
Bleach, Gibbs.

15:59.592 --> 16:03.430
Chemical test confirms that both
the stanchion and the lifeline

16:03.463 --> 16:06.166
were cleaned with bleach--
which is odd, since Navy 101

16:06.199 --> 16:09.002
is to never use bleach
on a ship's weather decks,

16:09.036 --> 16:10.703
because...
It's too corrosive.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.773
Yeah. Someone
would only use it if...

16:13.806 --> 16:15.008
They were really trying
to hide something.

16:24.517 --> 16:29.022
I always suspected Collins'
death wasn't an accident, but...

16:29.056 --> 16:31.124
it doesn't make this
any easier.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.693
Any idea
who's responsible?

16:33.726 --> 16:36.063
Not yet, but we will.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.299
Right, Agent Torres?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.700
Uh-huh.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.535
(exhales)

16:42.569 --> 16:43.803
Look, I appreciate
the company,

16:43.836 --> 16:45.405
but if you're here
to ask me questions,

16:45.438 --> 16:48.041
just ask them.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.244
Were you in a relationship
with Petty Officer Collins?

16:51.278 --> 16:54.647
(chuckling):
You talked to Holden Baxter.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.717
Real prize, isn't he?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.053
Well, he didn't have
many good things

17:00.087 --> 17:01.454
to say about you,
either, so...

17:01.488 --> 17:03.790
Can't imagine
he would.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.792
I've reprimanded him
so many times,

17:05.825 --> 17:08.095
he got bumped down a pay grade.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.264
And what about Collins?

17:11.298 --> 17:14.401
Nothing inappropriate
was going on.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.737
BISHOP: Baxter wasn't the only
person onboard who said

17:17.770 --> 17:19.739
that you two spent
a lot of time together.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.141
(soft chuckle)

17:21.174 --> 17:23.676
I mean, that's because we did.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.414
Collins had
tremendous potential.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.816
I knew he was
officer material.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.819
I was helping him
apply for a commission.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.089
(voice breaking):
We sent off his application

17:36.123 --> 17:38.158
to Officer Candidate School
a few weeks before

17:38.191 --> 17:40.627
he went missing.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.264
BISHOP: In that time together,
did he ever mention

17:44.297 --> 17:46.466
having any issues with anyone?

17:46.499 --> 17:50.270
Only with Baxter, but...

17:50.303 --> 17:52.472
so did everyone.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.841
Collins was the
type of person

17:54.874 --> 17:57.144
to fix problems,

17:57.177 --> 18:00.547
not the kind to start them.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.215
ABBY:
Here you go. Bottoms up.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.816
Okay, what is it?

18:03.850 --> 18:07.154
It's a smoothie concoction
made especially for you.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.756
It'll put that extra
pep back in your step.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.324
What are you talking about?

18:11.358 --> 18:13.826
Well, I saw your run time,
Torres posted it online.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.529
He what?
Just consider it motivation.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.466
One glass of that, and it'll
get your cardio juices flowing.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.667
It's got all the essentials,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.302
whey protein,
bananas, chia seeds,

18:22.335 --> 18:23.503
almond butter,

18:23.536 --> 18:24.804
coconut milk.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
Why is it fizzy?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.743
That's my secret ingredient.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.646
I'm calling it Power-POW.
So how is it?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.449
It tastes unlike anything
I've ever tasted before.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.385
Well, good, because
there's plenty more
where that came from.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.853
Gibbs, you're just in
time for a taste test.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.156
No, I just ate.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.824
Well, good news.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.926
You don't even have to share.
How about sharing a lead?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.695
Yes, with pleasure, boss.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.164
When, uh, Collins was aboard
the USS Gray,

18:51.198 --> 18:53.400
the ship was deployed on
a counter-narcotics mission

18:53.433 --> 18:54.934
in South America.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.571
In six months, the USS Gray
seized over $2 billion worth

18:58.605 --> 19:00.440
of cocaine from
different drug vessels.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.741
When they got back to Norfolk,

19:01.774 --> 19:03.710
the drugs were
turned over to the D.E.A.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.412
to be analyzed and catalogued.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.581
Did you know that drugs
are like a fingerprint?

19:08.615 --> 19:11.718
No two batches are
processed identically.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.754
Which is where the USS Gray's
port visits come into play.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.823
Especially
Panama City, Panama

19:16.856 --> 19:18.325
and Willemstad,
Curaçao.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.492
What about them?

19:19.526 --> 19:20.727
ABBY:
Well, last month,

19:20.760 --> 19:22.462
cocaine was seized
in a police raid

19:22.495 --> 19:24.697
in Curaçao that
had the exact same

19:24.731 --> 19:28.201
chemical makeup as a shipment
that originated in Panama.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.203
Same shipment that
was previously seized

19:30.237 --> 19:32.505
by the USS Gray
and supposedly turned over

19:32.539 --> 19:34.441
to the D.E.A.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.709
So how did confiscated
Panamanian drugs

19:36.743 --> 19:38.645
end up on the streets
of Curaçao?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.747
And what if that's what
got Collins killed?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.223
Earth to Torres.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.759
Were you talking to me?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.495
Yeah, for, like,
the last five minutes.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.996
You didn't hear any of that?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.832
Blah, blah, case stuff,
Gibbs on his way, got it.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.270
What's going on with you?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.638
You've been acting
weird all day.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.241
Okay, first of all,
I don't act weird.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.742
I act mysterious.

20:09.776 --> 20:14.013
Mm, okay, so why are
you acting mysterious?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.482
I'm not.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.749
It's good to see

20:16.783 --> 20:17.917
you're so in touch
with your feelings.

20:17.950 --> 20:18.951
Update.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.390
If someone onboard
the USS Gray

20:23.423 --> 20:24.957
stole even
a fraction

20:24.991 --> 20:26.659
of the drugs
they seized,

20:26.693 --> 20:27.960
they stood to make
a hefty profit.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.829
Yeah, just a single
brick of cocaine

20:29.862 --> 20:31.298
can go for 25 grand.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.700
Money had to go somewhere.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.503
Yeah, well, only 12 sailors from
the boarding team had access

20:36.536 --> 20:38.805
to the secure compartment
where the drugs were kept.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.407
BISHOP: We checked
their financials

20:40.440 --> 20:42.909
for any irregularities
and found one account

20:42.942 --> 20:45.845
with unexplained
sizable cash deposits.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.682
Petty Officer Nicole Trainer.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.651
QUINN:
Nice place.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.586
McGEE:
Gives me the creeps.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.555
Keep waiting for those
twins from The Shining

20:55.588 --> 20:57.056
to pop out.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.059
So Trainer's got
100K in the bank,

21:00.092 --> 21:01.961
and she lives here?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.463
Not exactly the
safest neighborhood.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.332
Well, says the guy who
had four dead bodies

21:05.365 --> 21:06.533
in his apartment.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.401
Five.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.370
NCIS!

21:10.403 --> 21:12.672
(man shouts outside)

21:14.741 --> 21:16.576
Oh, Quinn.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.844
What?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.812
Sneak peek.
I'll boost you up.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.415
Come on.
If I go down,
you're coming down with me.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.484
All right,
on three.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.518
One,

21:25.552 --> 21:26.653
two,

21:26.686 --> 21:27.754
three!

21:27.787 --> 21:29.556
(grunts)

21:31.057 --> 21:33.059
Oh, McGee, we have a problem.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.567
It's Trainer.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.869
It's clear.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.072
She's dead.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.786
Got it. Thanks.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.853
Where are we?

22:00.887 --> 22:03.055
McGee and Quinn finished
with Trainer's neighbors.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.924
No one heard
or saw anything.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.926
All they said was
that she kept to herself.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.362
With the amount of heroin
bagged at her place,

22:09.396 --> 22:11.498
an overdose was just
a matter of time.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.065
It's too clean.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.867
You're thinking it was staged

22:14.901 --> 22:16.669
to look like an accident
like Collins' murder?

22:16.703 --> 22:17.937
Well, we're
gonna find out.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.806
Torres, get to
the hospital.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.474
You're on protection detail
for Lieutenant Ellison.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.076
You really think she's a target?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.945
I'm not willing to risk it.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.615
That's not gonna work
for me, Gibbs.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.116
I'm not a hospital guy.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.486
Besides, don't you think
that Bishop is

22:33.520 --> 22:34.821
a lot more suited
to protect Ellison?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.956
No. I don't.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.158
I said you. Now go.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.394
Why me?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.102
There a problem?

22:50.136 --> 22:53.473
You know there is.

22:55.141 --> 22:59.078
But that's the point, isn't it?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.114
What are you trying to do?

23:02.148 --> 23:04.651
My job.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.386
I suggest you do yours.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.032
What do you got?

23:20.066 --> 23:24.504
The results of Miss Trainer's
autopsy tell a sad story.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.940
Her body exhibits
extensive damage consistent

23:27.974 --> 23:29.876
with narcotics abuse.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.478
Too young to go out
like this, Duck.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.880
Well, drugs don't discriminate
with age, Jethro.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.750
It's an equal-opportunity
serial killer, but while

23:37.784 --> 23:39.819
an overdose was
the cause of death,

23:39.852 --> 23:43.456
I do not believe
it was of her own choosing.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.493
Look at these ligature marks
on her wrists.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.929
She was restrained?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.798
I suspect by the same person

23:51.831 --> 23:54.233
who injected her
with a fatal dose.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.868
However,

23:55.902 --> 23:57.970
I found tissue
under her fingernails.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.040
Abby is analyzing it
for DNA as we speak.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.042
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

24:03.075 --> 24:05.578
I got a DNA hit
from Ducky's tissue sample.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.680
In record time.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.181
That's because
it's a match to a sailor

24:09.215 --> 24:10.917
that's onboard the USS Gray.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.654
Petty Officer Holden Baxter.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.791
Anything?

24:18.825 --> 24:20.760
No sign of Baxter
at berthing, boss.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.094
He's not in engineering.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.531
I talked to a sailor
on the mess decks said

24:24.564 --> 24:26.065
Baxter goes off
base for lunch.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.567
All right, check it out.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.101
McGee, take the pier.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.704
Bishop, come on.
You're with me.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.545
Well, there he is.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.146
Baxter?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.960
(grunting)

24:53.993 --> 24:55.728
Get off me, man!
I didn't do anything!

24:55.762 --> 24:57.830
(tires screech)

24:57.864 --> 24:58.831
Come on.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.933
You okay?
No!

25:00.967 --> 25:02.569
I think he broke my rib.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.936
Wasn't talking to you.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.573
Me? I am better than ever.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.885
You know you're allowed to sit,
right?

25:20.286 --> 25:22.121
Uh-huh.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.792
Have you, uh,
worked for NCIS long?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.128
Yeah.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.630
(laughs)

25:30.663 --> 25:32.832
What about
that Hindenburg disaster, huh?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.867
What a mess that was.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.969
What?

25:37.003 --> 25:38.738
I don't know.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.339
I had to say something.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.341
You've been here for hours,

25:42.374 --> 25:45.344
and you've barely said
ten words.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.615
Making conversation
with you is like pulling teeth.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.282
Well, then, don't.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.218
I'm working.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.991
You're not the first one,
you know.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.960
I've seen it before.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.596
Seen what?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.998
Ever since I was diagnosed,

26:06.032 --> 26:10.202
I can tell a lot about people by
the way they interact with me.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.707
Yeah, most people just
shower me with sympathy or pity,

26:14.741 --> 26:20.279
or put on a brave face
to try and keep my spirits up.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.849
Then there are the people
who do everything they can

26:22.882 --> 26:25.151
to keep their distance from me.

26:25.184 --> 26:28.087
They're the ones

26:28.120 --> 26:30.089
who've been through the pain

26:30.122 --> 26:32.759
of losing someone
they loved to cancer.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.994
They don't want
to be reminded of it,

26:35.027 --> 26:37.864
so... they avoid me.

26:37.897 --> 26:41.267
Just like you're doing.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.270
I understand.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.940
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:56.716 --> 27:00.086
You think I'm here to recreate
a Hallmark moment with you?

27:00.119 --> 27:03.222
Let me make
something clear.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.692
I'm not.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.194
Got it?

27:08.227 --> 27:10.963
Got it.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.365
Good.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.403
(sighs)

27:19.005 --> 27:20.372
Are you deaf, man?

27:20.406 --> 27:22.174
I said I need a doctor!

27:22.208 --> 27:24.243
Then cooperate, man.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.678
By the way,

27:25.712 --> 27:27.379
McGee, that was
a very impressive sprint.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.848
Good hustle.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.249
Oh, thank you.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.318
Think I owe that one
to Abby's Power-POW!

27:32.351 --> 27:34.921
Hmm. It was like watching
a cheetah attack a gazelle.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.723
And now attack a dirt bag.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
Sticks and stones, sweetheart.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.060
Call me that again,
I'm gonna go find some.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.729
I already told you--

27:42.762 --> 27:45.765
I had nothing to do
with Collins' death.

27:45.798 --> 27:49.101
How about
Nicole Trainer?

27:51.037 --> 27:52.905
Is this some kind of sick joke?

27:52.939 --> 27:55.341
Nicole can't be dead.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.176
I just saw her last night.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.146
Yeah, we know. Found your DNA
under her fingernails.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.782
Whoa, whoa!
It's not what you think.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.017
I would never hurt Nicole.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.153
All I've ever done
is try to protect her.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.421
Protect her from what?

28:09.455 --> 28:11.490
(sighs)

28:11.523 --> 28:14.060
During our deployment,
Collins said he suspected

28:14.093 --> 28:15.427
Nicole was stealing
the drugs onboard,

28:15.461 --> 28:17.429
and thought I put her up to it.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.365
Did you?
No.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.368
I told him
Nicole would never do that.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.170
I figured
Collins just let it go,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.806
but when you came around asking
questions about his death,

28:26.839 --> 28:28.941
I knew something wasn't right,

28:28.975 --> 28:30.943
so I went to Nicole's
and confronted her.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.980
What did she say?

28:34.013 --> 28:36.482
She admitted
to stealing the drugs,

28:36.515 --> 28:38.785
but she said
she was forced into it.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.519
Forced? By who?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.454
I don't know,

28:42.488 --> 28:44.791
but she was terrified of him.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.259
That's when she lost it on me
and threw me out.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.797
I swear, she was alive
when I left.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.299
And you didn't think
to come to us?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.734
I didn't want Nicole
to get into trouble.

28:57.937 --> 29:01.774
I thought
I was doing the right thing.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.111
Thank you.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.813
Look like you needed it.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.114
You're keeping my daughter safe.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.548
It's the least I could do.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.083
Just a precaution.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.484
You don't need to worry.

29:12.518 --> 29:13.986
(laughs)

29:14.020 --> 29:15.421
If I'm being honest,

29:15.454 --> 29:18.090
what worries me
is NCIS solving the case.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.460
I know how horrible
that sounds.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.395
This is what's given Laura
the strength

29:23.429 --> 29:25.865
to keep fighting. Uh...

29:25.898 --> 29:28.935
I'm not ready for what happens
once she gets that closure.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.070
It's selfish, but, uh,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.372
I was hoping for
more time with her.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.444
Well... you will.

29:38.477 --> 29:42.348
Ducky said that
the experimental treatment

29:42.381 --> 29:45.184
could give your daughter
a few more years.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.956
She was turned down
for the program. Uh...

29:49.989 --> 29:53.159
her cancer is too far spread for
the treatment to be effective.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.964
Does she know?

29:57.997 --> 30:00.166
The doctor told
her this morning,

30:00.199 --> 30:02.101
just before you got here.

30:02.134 --> 30:07.439
When you're a parent, you would
do anything for your child.

30:07.473 --> 30:11.210
I would cut out my own kidney
with a spoon if Laura needed it.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.953
Now, my daughter
is going to die.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.290
And there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

30:38.537 --> 30:42.208
Yes, I understand the urgency
of the matter.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.076
Actually, he just walked in.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.612
Yes, ma'am. I will
pass that along.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.180
SECNAV.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.049
She's taken an interest
in the Collins case.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.918
We're working on it.
Working on it. I got that.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.053
But now, we're dealing
with two dead sailors

30:54.086 --> 30:56.588
and drug smuggling
on board a U.S. Navy ship.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.224
SECNAV wants answers.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.591
Petty Officer Baxter
was with Trainer

30:59.625 --> 31:01.293
the night she was killed.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.029
My gut says he's not our guy.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.064
Well, if he's telling the truth
about her being coerced

31:05.097 --> 31:08.034
into stealing the drugs, then
someone was pulling her strings.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.036
SECNAV has offered
the resources

31:10.069 --> 31:12.438
of her office
to expedite this investigation.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.073
Whatever you need.
Good.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.607
I need a favor.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.176
Well, that didn't take long.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.245
What exactly did you have
in mind?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.187
Shouldn't be out here
in the cold.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.357
(laughs)

31:31.390 --> 31:33.592
If the weather
wants to kill me,

31:33.625 --> 31:35.494
it'll have to take a number.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.196
(laughs)

31:41.633 --> 31:44.703
At least take this.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.006
(chuckles)

31:47.039 --> 31:49.041
If you insist.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.012
(birds singing)

31:54.513 --> 31:56.548
(inhales)
Okay, uh...

31:56.582 --> 31:59.685
I vote we just bite the bullet,
apologize

31:59.718 --> 32:01.387
and move on.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.356
Sound like a plan?

32:05.391 --> 32:08.961
Okay, I'll go first.

32:08.995 --> 32:12.331
(sighs)

32:12.364 --> 32:15.601
When you receive
a terminal diagnosis,

32:15.634 --> 32:20.306
things suddenly become
very clear.

32:20.339 --> 32:24.110
You realize that time...

32:24.143 --> 32:28.747
is your most precious commodity,
and because of that,

32:28.780 --> 32:33.452
I tend to speak
more matter-of-factly.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.524
I mean, if...

32:38.557 --> 32:41.160
if what I said
offended you, I...

32:41.193 --> 32:44.163
I'm truly sorry.

32:44.196 --> 32:49.001
This is the point
where you say something.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.706
I don't like clutter
in my workspace.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.643
Deep.

32:57.676 --> 33:01.147
All right. Um...

33:01.180 --> 33:05.017
I'm a minimalist.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.153
You know, like,
um, essentials only.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.788
Nothing personal.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.457
(clears throat)

33:11.490 --> 33:15.061
Except for this photo frame
that I keep on my desk,

33:15.094 --> 33:18.430
and I've ke...
I've kept it with me for years.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.133
Photo of what?

33:21.167 --> 33:23.135
Of me.

33:23.169 --> 33:26.405
Well, a 19-year-old me.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.607
You keep a framed photo

33:28.640 --> 33:31.477
of yourself on your desk?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.746
(chuckles) Okay, it's not
the photo that's important.
(chuckles)

33:34.780 --> 33:36.382
It was a gift.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.549
It was taken

33:37.583 --> 33:39.118
by a good friend of mine.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.486
Sofia.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.122
We were inseparable
since we were five.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.390
Even teachers
thought that we were twins.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.791
(chuckles)

33:45.824 --> 33:48.294
I remember this one time
when we were in high school.

33:48.327 --> 33:52.131
We're in the cafeteria,
and I looked at her.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.700
In that moment, I knew.
I just...

33:54.733 --> 33:57.303
I just knew

33:57.336 --> 34:00.306
that this girl
was gonna be my wife.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.542
I just knew that
we were gonna get married.

34:03.575 --> 34:08.447
Never been more sure
about anything in my life.

34:10.816 --> 34:13.152
When was she diagnosed?

34:13.185 --> 34:15.321
Senior year.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.725
I was so confused because...

34:19.758 --> 34:22.794
I mean, what teenager worries
about getting cancer?

34:22.828 --> 34:25.664
But Sofia was determined
to make it.

34:25.697 --> 34:29.268
You know,
she was gonna beat it.

34:29.301 --> 34:33.572
It didn't matter to her that
none of the medicine worked.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.542
You know,
she never gave up hope.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.211
And I, uh, I believed, you know?

34:39.245 --> 34:42.748
I-I just knew
that she was gonna make it.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.453
When I got the call,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.755
I wasn't ready.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.857
Yeah.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.160
No one ever is.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.629
So...

34:57.663 --> 34:59.798
you were right.

34:59.831 --> 35:03.502
Seeing you was a reminder
of everything that happened.

35:03.535 --> 35:07.873
And I didn't want
to be reminded.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.277
I was an ass.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.545
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.781
I'm sorry.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.486
Come on.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.888
There's some Jell-O
calling our names.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.790
Can't say no to that.
(laughs)

35:26.925 --> 35:29.861
Gibbs, we were going through
the USS Gray's

35:29.895 --> 35:31.463
deployment logs,
and found something.

35:31.497 --> 35:35.467
Each time narcotics were
seized from a drug vessel,

35:35.501 --> 35:36.635
sailors from the boarding team
would transfer the contraband

35:36.668 --> 35:37.636
onto the ship.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.471
Which explains how

35:39.505 --> 35:40.872
Trainer got her
hands on the drugs.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.875
Except protocol was that
the sailors involved

35:43.909 --> 35:45.377
would be searched by
one or two supervisors

35:45.411 --> 35:47.646
to ensure no one
took the contraband.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.349
And the same supervisor
signed off on all

35:50.382 --> 35:51.917
of Trainer's searches.

35:51.950 --> 35:55.254
The ship's master-at-arms,
Chief Michael Vinton.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.123
All right, what do we
know about him?

35:58.156 --> 36:00.559
He enlisted in 1993.
Twice divorced, no kids.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.960
Lost his home and savings

36:01.993 --> 36:03.795
in 2007.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.796
Which is also when
his career

36:04.830 --> 36:06.632
began to stall.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.434
Vinton's been passed
over for promotions

36:08.467 --> 36:10.269
eight times.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.803
He's slated to
retire next month,

36:11.837 --> 36:13.939
but it wasn't voluntary,
he's being forced out.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.943
VINTON:
Extra duty

36:17.976 --> 36:19.678
is a punishment.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.647
It's not meant to be pleasant.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.316
This is what happens when
you show up late for muster.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.319
Do not do the crime
if you cannot do the time.

36:27.353 --> 36:30.822
GIBBS:
That's good advice.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.524
It's a shame
you didn't take it.

36:33.659 --> 36:34.960
Double murder--

36:34.993 --> 36:37.396
You're looking at a
mandatory life sentence.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.531
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

36:39.565 --> 36:41.567
We're gonna refresh
your memory.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.635
Petty Officer Collins.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.337
He clued into your
drug operation

36:45.371 --> 36:46.405
and confronted you.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.639
QUINN:
You killed him.

36:47.673 --> 36:48.940
Made it look like
an accident.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.443
And you were
the on-site investigator,

36:51.477 --> 36:53.379
so it was easy
to cover your tracks.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.481
Yeah, then we showed up
and started asking questions.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.948
QUINN: And then you
thought Nicole Trainer

36:56.982 --> 36:58.317
was now a liability,

36:58.350 --> 36:59.618
and you killed her as well.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.287
Yeah, and there's
the drug money.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.721
QUINN: I get it--
you didn't want to

37:02.754 --> 37:04.956
put it in a bank,
but hiding it

37:04.990 --> 37:07.926
in your attic crawlspace...
so cliché.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.764
Ah, ah, I wouldn't do that.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.702
Even if you did
get by us,

37:16.735 --> 37:18.937
you'd still have to
get by them.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.808
QUINN:
And they just found out

37:22.841 --> 37:24.910
you killed two of their own.

37:26.812 --> 37:30.616
I think you have
better chances with us.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.489
You are busted.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.491
What? Excuse me?

37:39.525 --> 37:41.026
We hacked your fitness
ticker app on your phone.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.428
Mm-hmm.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.629
You cheated
on our morning run.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.297
BISHOP:
Gave us a head start

37:45.331 --> 37:47.633
so you could catch an Uber
to the final mile mark.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.636
You never had any intention of
running that marathon, did you?

37:50.669 --> 37:53.572
No, I was just screwing
with you the whole time.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.873
* Hee-hee, hee-hee.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.642
Unbelievable.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.444
Wait till I get
my hands on Torres.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.045
I can't believe
he was in on this.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.513
Oh, he wasn't.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.882
He didn't cheat.
He actually ran.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.351
Then he really
is that fast?

38:05.384 --> 38:06.885
Oh, he's freakishly fast.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.488
Oof, we don't stand a chance
of beating his time, do we?

38:09.521 --> 38:11.790
No, absolutely not.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.493
Chief Vinton?
You're certain?

38:14.526 --> 38:15.927
Full confession.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.497
Once Collins figured out
what was going on,

38:18.530 --> 38:20.666
Vinton knew that
he'd turn him in,

38:20.699 --> 38:22.901
and he panicked.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.937
Gunny, I know how much
this meant to Laura.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.873
I can't thank you
enough for your help.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.808
Pleasure.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.010
Collins deserved justice.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.080
I only wish I could have
done more for him.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.615
You did.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.750
What do you mean?

38:38.784 --> 38:40.986
The Secretary of the Navy
reviewed Collins'

38:41.019 --> 38:42.588
OCS application.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.123
She saw the same
potential you did.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.026
He's been posthumously
commissioned rank of ensign.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.596
(exhales)

38:53.031 --> 38:55.767
I knew Collins would make

38:55.801 --> 38:57.836
a damn good naval officer.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.971
He had a good role model.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.073
Yes, he did.

39:04.743 --> 39:08.614
I'm truly grateful,
Agent Gibbs.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.649
For everything.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.385
(knock at door)

39:18.524 --> 39:22.628
Dad, why don't you go grab
a bite to eat with Gibbs?

39:23.762 --> 39:25.731
I'll be fine.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.700
Come on, General,
I know just the place.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.876
Hey, Gibbs...

39:37.909 --> 39:40.512
We're good?

39:45.951 --> 39:48.053
The case is over.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.955
Thought you'd be
long gone by now.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.558
You trying to get rid
of me already?
Mm.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.926
I've grown kind of used
to having you around.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.096
Mm, I'm so touched.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.931
Hey, you know, actually,
I'm glad you're here.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.933
I want to show you something.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.039
It's my surface warfare pin.
(chuckles)

40:08.073 --> 40:09.775
Some serious blood,
sweat and tears

40:09.808 --> 40:12.444
went into earning it.

40:12.478 --> 40:15.046
The day I did is one
I'll never forget.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.516
Mm.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.185
I want you to have it.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.654
Me?

40:22.688 --> 40:23.722
Wouldn't you rather your dad...

40:23.755 --> 40:25.090
No.

40:25.123 --> 40:29.160
He's a marine.
He'll understand.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.104
Are you sure?

40:42.874 --> 40:44.710
I want you to have it
for the same reason

40:44.743 --> 40:47.579
Sofia gave you that photo.

40:47.613 --> 40:52.751
It wasn't about giving you
something to remember her by.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.488
It was her way of saying

40:56.522 --> 40:59.090
she'll remember you, too.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.633
Thank you.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.173
But I do have
a stipulation.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.208
Of course you do.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.482
No matter how little time
the doctors say you have...

41:26.885 --> 41:28.920
...you keep fighting...

41:30.922 --> 41:33.625
...every day...

41:33.659 --> 41:36.261
for the next day.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.631
And the next, and the next.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.934
All right.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.842
I have a little stipulation
of my own.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.579
I'm listening.
(chuckles)

41:53.612 --> 41:55.981
When you look at that pin,
I don't want it to remind you

41:56.014 --> 41:58.884
of some girl who died.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.820
I want it to remind you
of someone you helped.

42:03.922 --> 42:07.058
Because you did, Nick.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.199
Got it?

42:16.067 --> 42:19.170
Got it.
Good.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.540
I'm glad we worked that out.
(chuckles)
Yeah.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.212
(clears throat)

42:28.947 --> 42:31.316
You're sticking around?

42:31.349 --> 42:34.152
Yeah. They got free Jell-O.
Where else would I be?

42:34.185 --> 42:36.822
(laughs)

42:36.855 --> 42:37.856
(exhales)
