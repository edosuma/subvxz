WEBVTT

00:28.858 --> 00:30.983
It was sometime around 1979,

00:31.025 --> 00:33.400
when fate decided to give
me a boot up the arse.

00:33.442 --> 00:34.733
Fuckin' dead man.

00:43.483 --> 00:45.483
What's the
score here, you might ask?

00:45.525 --> 00:48.567
Well, it all started with
a very smart investment

00:48.608 --> 00:50.692
on Rapid River romping home at 10 to one.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.608
Which meant up the hackie down the blackie

00:53.650 --> 00:56.483
for a couple of celebrationary sharpners.

00:56.525 --> 00:57.942
Sink a couple of them
down the hatch, and then,

00:57.983 --> 01:01.233
it's onto the student
union for a drunken shag

01:01.275 --> 01:02.192
Poetry, eh?

01:03.150 --> 01:05.733
Now, I've sunk my fair share
of triple brandies and coke

01:05.775 --> 01:08.942
by this point, and that's when I met her.

01:08.983 --> 01:10.983
Honestly, at the time,
I coulda swore she was

01:11.025 --> 01:13.858
the spitting image of
the blond bird from ABBA.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.733
Like I said, I had few.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.067
An hour later, and we're back to hers.

01:18.108 --> 01:20.192
Under starters orders, and they're off.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.692
Well nearly.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.067
I remember asking her something like,

01:23.108 --> 01:24.650
Who's that?

01:24.692 --> 01:26.233
It's my fiance, Malky.

01:26.275 --> 01:27.692
He's in the jail.

01:28.608 --> 01:29.942
The jail?

01:29.983 --> 01:31.692
That was my cue to fucking leave.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.775
Get ready for
a big night, darlin'.

01:33.817 --> 01:34.900
Davie, I'm really sorry.

01:34.942 --> 01:36.775
I thought he'd be in for
much longer. He's in for GBH.

01:36.817 --> 01:38.400
And then, like a
scene from the bloody Shining,

01:38.442 --> 01:42.358
Charles Manson look-a-like
comes walking through the door.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.608
Talk about a close shave.

01:43.650 --> 01:44.817
But it doesn't end there, though.

01:44.858 --> 01:46.317
No, no, no, no.

01:46.358 --> 01:49.275
A week later, I'm down at
Grouchos, earning some coin.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.108
You workin' here, my lad?

01:50.150 --> 01:50.942
Short term contract.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.233
Cool.

01:54.233 --> 01:57.858
Just 'til the
student grant kicks in.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.525
And that is the moment when fate

01:59.567 --> 02:02.150
finally decides to take a hand.

02:07.317 --> 02:09.983
Van Halen, pal.

02:10.025 --> 02:10.817
Van Halen?

02:10.858 --> 02:11.650
Jesus.

02:11.692 --> 02:13.317
You sure?

02:20.067 --> 02:20.858
You.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.692
What was it the
wee Chinese boy with the

02:21.733 --> 02:23.858
hat and the red book used to say?

02:23.900 --> 02:26.650
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

02:27.525 --> 02:29.858
Aye, I guess you could say
it's something like that.

02:40.358 --> 02:42.483
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

02:42.525 --> 02:43.817
{\an8}There are certainly gonna

02:43.858 --> 02:46.400
{\an8}be some celebrations tonight.

02:49.525 --> 02:51.525
Very exciting, indeed.

03:23.317 --> 03:27.317
Haggis, which,
believe me, is delicious.

03:31.233 --> 03:36.067
{\an8}♪ I say why, I saw why ♪

03:39.650 --> 03:41.108
{\an8}Pitch is looking good.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.108
{\an8}Should be, the amount of
shite played here last season.

03:44.150 --> 03:45.733
The team made the paper today!

03:45.775 --> 03:46.608
Come on.

03:56.275 --> 03:58.317
Many London pubs
were attempting to cut off

03:58.358 --> 04:02.692
{\an8}essential supplies to the
Tartan Army by remaining shut.

04:07.192 --> 04:09.567
Have a fucking word, man.

04:09.608 --> 04:11.442
So that's where my journey begins.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.525
And, by chance, that single step,

04:14.983 --> 04:16.149
starts with a break.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.774
Fuckin' dead man.

04:23.483 --> 04:25.192
Can you walk it off son?

04:25.233 --> 04:26.817
I can't even feel it.

04:26.858 --> 04:29.067
Aye, must be numb.

04:29.108 --> 04:31.483
We'll try some deep heat, eh?

04:31.525 --> 04:33.483
See if it brings back the sensation.

04:33.525 --> 04:34.608
I think I'm in shock a dinn-y.

04:34.650 --> 04:35.442
Okay, here we go.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.233
Old Ralph said you can get a start

04:38.275 --> 04:42.442
at the printers, even with your stooky on.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.483
Every cloud, eh?

04:43.525 --> 04:46.400
Willie, it's only a broken leg.

04:47.275 --> 04:51.025
Well, he's gonna need to face the facts.

04:51.067 --> 04:54.275
The ball's burst, the games up the pulley.

04:54.317 --> 04:55.358
His football days are over.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.733
Rubbish.

04:56.775 --> 04:59.400
Six weeks and the leg will be good as new.

04:59.442 --> 05:01.025
When I was a nurse,

05:01.067 --> 05:02.317
no, no, listen.

05:04.442 --> 05:07.192
We were told when you break a bone,

05:07.233 --> 05:11.400
it comes back even stronger
with the new stuff.

05:12.900 --> 05:16.692
You just need to screw a few pins into it.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.983
A few pins.

05:19.025 --> 05:21.275
I'll give old Ralph a
phone in the morning, son.

05:21.317 --> 05:23.233
Willie, will you shut up?

05:23.275 --> 05:25.108
Stop depressing the lad.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.317
Hello Davie.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.025
- I'm Shona, student nurse
- And that's when I met her.

05:29.067 --> 05:32.150
I can assure you you're in good hands.

05:32.192 --> 05:33.942
I'll be checking on you regularly.

05:33.983 --> 05:37.567
You really are quite beautiful.

05:37.608 --> 05:38.858
What's that?

05:38.900 --> 05:42.233
I actually ken about the
Florence Nightingale effect,

05:42.275 --> 05:46.733
where the patient falls
in love with the nurse.

05:46.775 --> 05:49.608
I read a lotta about history.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.067
Lot of books on war.

05:53.358 --> 05:55.858
That's not what I'm trying to say.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.150
The only thing that's
gonna get me through this

05:59.192 --> 06:03.650
career-ending injury is
knowing I've got a date

06:03.692 --> 06:05.817
with a bonny lassie at the end of it.

06:05.858 --> 06:07.525
There is a level of confidence that can

06:07.567 --> 06:12.108
only be achieved when you're
out of your tits on morphine.

06:12.150 --> 06:12.942
So, just when you think

06:12.983 --> 06:15.817
you're Shakespeare spouting a sonnet,

06:15.858 --> 06:19.067
Sorry, what are you trying to say?

06:19.108 --> 06:20.858
You're actually talking pish,

06:20.900 --> 06:24.817
looking like Plug from the Beano comic.

06:24.858 --> 06:27.275
Davie, I'll get the bib on.

06:30.067 --> 06:30.983
Oh, fu...

06:57.775 --> 06:59.192
Alright, Davie.

07:01.025 --> 07:02.525
Scot, nice jacket.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.775
Do you get any hassle for selling in here?

07:10.608 --> 07:12.525
What you selling anyway?

07:13.608 --> 07:15.525
I can handle my self.

07:19.775 --> 07:21.108
So can I.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.150
All right, Davie.

07:35.192 --> 07:36.483
Back for more, eh?

07:36.525 --> 07:37.775
Leave him, Malky.

07:37.817 --> 07:38.733
Get fucked, Scott.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.400
The wee twat shagged me missus.

07:40.442 --> 07:42.233
Strangle everyone who's
shagged your missus,

07:42.275 --> 07:44.233
it's gonna be a busy month.

07:44.275 --> 07:45.567
That's my
fiancé yer talking 'bout

07:45.608 --> 07:48.025
Malcolm, my old friend,

07:48.067 --> 07:52.275
She's had more pricks
than The Powrie dartboard.

07:52.317 --> 07:54.025
I'm gonna bang yer pus, Scott!

07:54.067 --> 07:55.733
Well, you'll get a crutch in yours.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.233
Take it outside boys?

07:58.275 --> 07:59.108
Get the,

08:00.942 --> 08:02.358
Sorry, no bother.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.358
If I dinn-y see you through the week,

08:05.400 --> 08:09.025
I'll see you through the window, Davie.

08:12.025 --> 08:12.817
Come on.

08:15.900 --> 08:16.733
I owe you one.

08:16.775 --> 08:17.608
Nah.

08:17.650 --> 08:18.567
We're even.

08:19.692 --> 08:21.275
You just saved my life.

08:21.317 --> 08:22.692
Least I can get you is a drink.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.025
Me?

08:24.067 --> 08:25.775
I'm too young.

08:25.817 --> 08:27.608
Double vodka and orange.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.150
How you getting on?

08:29.192 --> 08:30.942
Crutches okay?

08:30.983 --> 08:32.400
I won't be tripping the light fantastic

08:32.442 --> 08:36.232
for a wee while, but we're gettin' there.

08:36.275 --> 08:38.650
So, how did it go with old Ralph?

08:40.567 --> 08:42.317
I go and meet
this Ralph character,

08:42.357 --> 08:44.067
and while he's giving
a tour of the factory,

08:44.107 --> 08:47.567
he's just waffling on and
on about jute and whale oil,

08:47.608 --> 08:50.317
and how whale oil is essential
in the processing of jute.

08:50.358 --> 08:51.858
A handy supply of whale oil.

08:51.900 --> 08:52.650
Whale oil?

08:52.692 --> 08:53.650
Aye.

08:53.692 --> 08:55.692
Ralph is a lovely old guy, and I'm sure

08:55.733 --> 08:57.983
this is all very interesting to him.

08:58.025 --> 09:00.775
But you try listening to
that for two hours solid.

09:00.817 --> 09:03.400
I did actually learn
something new that day.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.108
Did you know that jute
really comes from India?

09:06.192 --> 09:08.108
Fuckin' riveting, right?

09:08.150 --> 09:09.650
So, I asked him.

09:09.692 --> 09:12.150
Ever been to India, Ralph?

09:12.192 --> 09:17.108
Just the Taj Mahal up the
Perth Road for a chicken korma.

09:17.150 --> 09:18.858
- And jute...
- Then he just started

09:18.900 --> 09:21.775
going on about jute and whale oil again.

09:21.817 --> 09:25.900
At this point, I couldn't take
any more, so I had to ask.

09:25.942 --> 09:29.442
Ralph, what exactly is my job gonna be?

09:29.483 --> 09:31.400
See that lever?

09:31.442 --> 09:32.275
Uh-huh.

09:36.733 --> 09:39.483
Pull it to switch the press on.

09:44.942 --> 09:46.233
Right.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.525
Pull it to switch it off.

09:53.983 --> 09:54.817
That it?

09:56.192 --> 09:58.817
I'm sure there'll be more.

09:58.858 --> 10:01.025
believe me, I asked.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.400
Well, sometimes the
press needs recalibrating..

10:04.442 --> 10:06.942
Quite a skilled and complex job, actually.

10:06.983 --> 10:08.525
And I'll be learning
all about that, will I?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.233
Oh no, we'll get a guy in.

10:10.275 --> 10:11.858
You just start her up and give me

10:11.900 --> 10:13.983
a shout, if you got any bother.

10:14.025 --> 10:15.692
Job for life, son.

10:15.733 --> 10:17.858
That is not for me, Ma.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.983
Well, there's always your football.

10:22.192 --> 10:24.150
Football's finished.

10:24.192 --> 10:26.775
Let's face it, I'm no exactly George Best.

10:26.817 --> 10:27.858
I can't imagine the
Football Hall of Fame's

10:27.900 --> 10:29.150
gonna be missin' me.

10:29.192 --> 10:31.108
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.025
I get enough of that with your dad.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.192
You'll bounce back, Davie.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.067
Thanks.

10:38.817 --> 10:40.233
I do have a plan.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.400
So, what's that then?

10:43.442 --> 10:46.025
I watched this
documentary by John Pilger

10:46.067 --> 10:48.150
called "The Year Zero."

10:48.192 --> 10:51.400
About this guy in
Cambodia, called Pol Pot.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.400
Murdered millions of his own people,

10:53.442 --> 10:54.900
I'm talking work camps.

10:54.942 --> 10:57.275
Guy was a psycho, a
complete 'head the ball'

10:57.317 --> 11:01.150
Davie, What's this got to do with you?

11:01.192 --> 11:03.108
I wrote him a letter.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.692
Pol Pot?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.233
No, John Pilger.

11:08.192 --> 11:13.192
I offered him my help for like,
volunteering, or something.

11:13.692 --> 11:15.317
Cambodia!?

11:15.358 --> 11:18.692
For a boy who got sunstroke
going to the berries?

11:18.733 --> 11:19.817
Aye, a laugh.

11:20.733 --> 11:21.692
Well, in the meantime I've got

11:21.733 --> 11:24.567
something a wee bit more concrete.

11:27.733 --> 11:31.150
These, and another tenner on Lucky Break

11:31.192 --> 11:33.067
to win the 2:30 Epsom, eh?

11:33.108 --> 11:36.775
Back then, I had a bit of a
love affair with the horses.

11:36.817 --> 11:37.942
That'll be another tenner then.

11:37.983 --> 11:38.942
I'll get tick, then.

11:38.983 --> 11:40.608
You heard what happened, aye?

11:40.650 --> 11:41.942
Aye, we heard.

11:41.983 --> 11:43.733
But come on Davie,
we're a fuckin' bookies.

11:43.775 --> 11:45.317
I always pay my debts.

11:45.358 --> 11:47.775
Aye, ya did, before you were a cripple.

11:47.817 --> 11:51.358
Which leads to me Kenny,
my future debt collector.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.108
His APR might be pish compared to

11:53.150 --> 11:55.942
Littlewoods, but he's a fucking radge.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.150
Look, I still get a wee
stipend from the team,

11:57.192 --> 11:58.358
and the nurse says I'm
gonna be back soon...

11:58.400 --> 11:59.900
Couldn't gie a flying fuck.

11:59.942 --> 12:01.358
No job, no tick.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.775
- End of.
- Tenner.

12:02.817 --> 12:04.067
On Lucky Break.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.192
Hey, Willie.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.067
Hey.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.608
Hey.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.567
If your Mother caught me
doing that, it'd kill her.

12:17.608 --> 12:18.442
- Why do it then?
- Still getting grief

12:18.483 --> 12:20.108
about my old poker days.

12:20.150 --> 12:22.358
Well, why you do it then?

12:23.858 --> 12:26.317
You've had a bit of a hard time.

12:26.358 --> 12:28.650
Just make sure that's the last of it.

12:28.692 --> 12:30.442
If I catch you again I'll tell her.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.317
I thought it would kill her.

12:32.358 --> 12:34.400
Just promise you won't do it again?

12:34.442 --> 12:35.483
I promise.

12:35.525 --> 12:36.775
Promise what?

12:37.817 --> 12:39.233
That I'll no let you catch me.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.150
Look, I'm not daft, Dad.

12:41.192 --> 12:43.692
Aye, but you cannot pee far.

12:50.275 --> 12:54.817
Don't go spending that money
on quines, ya fuckin' loon.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.608
Don't spend it on lassies, Dad.

13:04.525 --> 13:05.358
Pink.

13:09.942 --> 13:11.025
That was blue.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.108
What?

13:12.150 --> 13:13.567
Are you colourblind?

13:15.442 --> 13:16.650
Aye.

13:21.942 --> 13:23.275
What?

14:10.858 --> 14:12.108
What you doing?

14:12.983 --> 14:14.567
Closing my pores.

14:15.650 --> 14:16.483
Right.

14:20.983 --> 14:23.025
Smooth Scott, smooth.

14:23.067 --> 14:23.900
Thanks.

14:48.692 --> 14:51.025
And there she was.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.733
You just gonna stare forever pal?

14:56.775 --> 14:57.608
Eh?

14:58.525 --> 15:00.733
There's lads in here
every week looking at her,

15:00.775 --> 15:02.608
but not any have got the bottle
to go up and talk to her.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.317
I don't really know what
I'd talk about with her.

15:04.358 --> 15:06.733
Ken anything about her?

15:06.775 --> 15:08.192
Student nurse.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.817
Talk to her about that, then.

15:13.067 --> 15:16.483
Any chance you can gaze
longingly from somewhere else?

15:16.525 --> 15:17.567
I need to go for a piss.

15:17.608 --> 15:18.775
Oh, sorry.

15:18.817 --> 15:19.650
Cheers.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.650
Here we fucking go.

15:46.067 --> 15:46.900
Shona.

15:48.483 --> 15:49.817
I just wanted thank you for nursing me

15:49.858 --> 15:51.858
back to relative health.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.858
I'd also like to say that I think

15:56.900 --> 15:59.400
that you're really, really...

15:59.442 --> 16:00.442
Beautiful?

16:01.525 --> 16:02.400
Yeah, I know.

16:02.442 --> 16:03.358
You told me about twenty times

16:03.400 --> 16:06.442
whilst swinging in and
out of consciousness.

16:06.483 --> 16:07.567
You swore it wasn't the so-called

16:07.608 --> 16:10.192
Florence Nightingale effect,
based on your knowledge

16:10.233 --> 16:13.983
of Commando Comics, and that
Van Halen was an arsehole.

16:14.025 --> 16:16.775
I was pretty buckled, to be fair.

16:16.817 --> 16:18.192
So, The Florence Nightingale effect

16:18.233 --> 16:20.942
is actually when the nurse
falls for the patient,

16:20.983 --> 16:23.108
not the other way around.

16:23.150 --> 16:28.150
Best we can diagnose, that's
not what happened here at all.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.733
I was just going to
offer you all free tickets

16:29.775 --> 16:32.525
to this uni disco I'm organizing.

16:33.650 --> 16:35.317
Sorry to bother you.

16:37.150 --> 16:37.983
Okay,

16:38.900 --> 16:39.733
Sure.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.150
What?

16:45.192 --> 16:48.567
Yes, you can take me
on a date to your disco.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.775
Aye, she called my bluff.

16:50.817 --> 16:51.733
Cheeky, eh?

16:52.900 --> 16:55.483
Well, considering our first encounter,

16:55.525 --> 16:57.108
she left me no choice.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.775
Cool.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.733
So I head over to Mennie's bar.

17:00.775 --> 17:03.567
Try and persuade Scott here
to join my new venture.

17:03.608 --> 17:05.191
You want to start a disco?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.066
Aye.

17:07.275 --> 17:08.441
And who's Shona?

17:08.483 --> 17:09.566
This lassie, mate.

17:09.608 --> 17:10.691
You should see her.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.983
Could you have no
asked her out normally?

17:13.025 --> 17:14.941
Disco is a bit fuckin' much, like.

17:14.983 --> 17:16.400
No, I could-nae.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.983
So you going to help me or what?

17:19.025 --> 17:19.816
I don't know, Davie.

17:19.858 --> 17:20.650
Come on, Scott.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.066
My student loan doesn't
stretch that far eh?

17:23.108 --> 17:26.233
Aye, if you keep buying
double brandies and coke.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.650
Will-nae.

17:27.691 --> 17:31.483
You gonna be slinging
dope all your days?

17:31.525 --> 17:33.775
You can make a tidy profit.

17:35.108 --> 17:36.150
If I'm being honest, I knew it would

17:36.192 --> 17:38.525
be easy to get Scott on-side.

17:38.567 --> 17:41.150
Extra money would be nice.

17:41.192 --> 17:42.858
Boy loves a pound note.

17:42.900 --> 17:46.983
All I had to do was to sell him the dream.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.317
Who's going to be
your disc jockey, then?

17:49.358 --> 17:50.775
I see this boy running about college

17:50.817 --> 17:52.358
with loads of records.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.858
Maybe he'd do it.

17:53.900 --> 17:54.983
Who's that?

17:56.150 --> 17:56.942
I think his name's John.

17:56.983 --> 17:59.233
But it was raising the
money and convincing John.

17:59.275 --> 18:01.483
That was the real problem.

18:01.525 --> 18:02.900
But right enough, good ole' Scotty-boy

18:02.942 --> 18:05.525
comes through with another brilliant idea.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.775
I've got an idea.

18:07.817 --> 18:08.942
Though I have to admit,

18:08.983 --> 18:10.192
the poster looked a bit shit.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.567
Here we go, lads, here we go.

18:12.608 --> 18:13.900
You organized a disco with me

18:13.942 --> 18:14.900
on the bill before you even asked?

18:14.942 --> 18:15.817
Wanted to show you
how ambitious we were.

18:15.858 --> 18:16.733
Ambitious?

18:16.775 --> 18:17.983
More like couple of bloody chancers.

18:18.025 --> 18:21.317
Gotta take chances to get
the best like you, John.

18:21.358 --> 18:23.775
We thought a team-up could
take us all to the next level.

18:23.817 --> 18:26.650
I was already going big time.

18:26.692 --> 18:28.525
Hey, there's not even any venue on it yet.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.025
Yeah, we've had a few ideas about that.

18:30.067 --> 18:30.858
Such as?

18:30.900 --> 18:32.067
Come on, somebody tackle up.

18:32.108 --> 18:33.650
How's your team getting on?

18:33.692 --> 18:34.483
Shite.

18:34.525 --> 18:36.150
You gonna answer my question?

18:36.192 --> 18:37.275
So after a few
words of inspiration,

18:37.317 --> 18:39.400
we managed to get John to join the team.

18:39.442 --> 18:42.692
But there was still one
situation to address.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.567
We were totally skint.

18:44.608 --> 18:46.483
But that's when John said.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.275
Maybe, I'm due some money from

18:49.317 --> 18:50.150
the Vicar.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.650
So, when John said the Vicar,

18:53.692 --> 18:56.067
we naturally thought it was
some mad gangster alias.

18:56.108 --> 18:57.775
Delighted to see you again.

18:57.817 --> 18:59.483
But really, it
was just a normal vicar.

18:59.525 --> 19:01.108
Father Vettriano.

19:01.150 --> 19:04.358
Always nice to have new
blood under our roof.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.233
Now, gentlemen, have you found

19:07.275 --> 19:09.442
religion for yourselves yet?

19:09.483 --> 19:11.067
There was something
weird about this guy, though,

19:11.108 --> 19:13.317
and I was almost certain
he tried to convert us.

19:13.358 --> 19:15.608
Well, I'm still a Prodie.

19:15.650 --> 19:16.442
Prodie.

19:16.483 --> 19:18.275
It eludes me yet, Father, but I prefer

19:18.317 --> 19:19.692
the Catholic show a bit more.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.775
Yes, well, if you do require

19:26.817 --> 19:29.733
some additional spiritual guidance,

19:32.317 --> 19:33.317
might one suggest.

19:33.358 --> 19:34.858
Then I really had my suspicions

19:34.900 --> 19:39.025
when he tried to offer us
some sort of sermon from.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.900
The big man himself.

19:45.608 --> 19:46.442
God?

19:47.567 --> 19:51.900
And of course,
it nearly fooled Scott.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.108
His Holiness is speaking

19:54.150 --> 19:56.900
at Bellahouston Park in a few weeks.

19:56.942 --> 19:58.817
Ah, Bellahouston.

19:58.858 --> 20:00.150
Great capacity.

20:00.192 --> 20:02.317
Well, he's vertainly got the
biggest fan club in the world.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.150
Now, business associates.

20:10.983 --> 20:13.650
You're here to collect your stipend

20:13.692 --> 20:17.358
from last week's rather
rambunctious soiree.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.483
The ten year olds were ecstatic.

20:22.483 --> 20:25.233
Oh, big time stuff alright.

20:25.275 --> 20:26.108
Now,

20:27.775 --> 20:29.983
I have a proposal.

20:30.025 --> 20:32.775
A possible deal as it were.

20:32.817 --> 20:33.983
Here we fucking go.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.942
If it would be at all amenable

20:36.983 --> 20:40.733
to offer an alternative
form of remuneration.

20:42.775 --> 20:46.358
To wit, would you accept
this fine painting

20:47.775 --> 20:50.442
by my nephew Jack by way of pay?

20:54.192 --> 20:55.858
Is he famous?

20:55.900 --> 20:58.358
Ah, but what is fame, if one is regarded

20:58.400 --> 21:00.525
by one's peers as a shining...

21:00.567 --> 21:03.817
Can we get much money for it?

21:03.858 --> 21:05.650
I fear not, but in time-

21:05.692 --> 21:08.817
- Really sorry, Father Vettriano, but

21:08.858 --> 21:10.733
we could kinda use the notes just now.

21:10.775 --> 21:11.775
Of course.

21:13.108 --> 21:15.358
Twenty notes was it not?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.317
Twenty five.

21:17.358 --> 21:20.442
And just like that,
we had ourselves a disco.

21:20.483 --> 21:21.567
Here, here.

21:22.567 --> 21:26.150
Three classy lassies in the
queue making my spring go ping!

21:26.192 --> 21:27.483
Get them in, pronto.

21:27.525 --> 21:28.358
Hey.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.400
Think we can do better?

21:31.442 --> 21:32.900
Better?

21:32.942 --> 21:35.567
If you ask me, Shona's got
better tits than Venus De Milo.

21:35.608 --> 21:37.358
Is she the lassie at the college?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.733
Venus De Milo?

21:38.775 --> 21:39.692
- Aye.
- Hey, bring that back,

21:39.733 --> 21:40.567
you fanny.

21:41.525 --> 21:42.942
Where's he going?

22:00.317 --> 22:01.150
Come on.

22:02.817 --> 22:06.275
Volume, that's the
record, don't let it skip.

22:06.317 --> 22:09.817
♪ This party, there's two ♪

22:11.775 --> 22:14.108
Do you dance, Davie the DJ?

22:14.150 --> 22:15.567
You askin'?

22:15.608 --> 22:17.192
Yeah, I'm askin'.

22:28.525 --> 22:30.400
What's that Scott?

22:30.442 --> 22:32.942
This is the next level John.

22:35.483 --> 22:36.942
It's beautiful.

22:36.983 --> 22:39.817
Where the fuck did you get that?

22:41.942 --> 22:44.775
What do you think of that, then?

22:45.900 --> 22:47.942
I think I'm going for that dance.

23:14.317 --> 23:15.692
Thought you were quite cute.

23:15.733 --> 23:16.525
Cute?

23:17.400 --> 23:18.192
I want to be rock and roll!

23:18.233 --> 23:19.900
I'm paying you a compliment.

23:19.942 --> 23:22.733
I don't go on dates with
every patient who asks me out.

23:22.775 --> 23:24.983
I'm going to do more nights like this.

23:25.025 --> 23:26.483
Proper bands would be cool.

23:26.525 --> 23:27.692
Ah, such as?

23:30.233 --> 23:31.025
Simple Minds have been getting

23:31.067 --> 23:32.567
a lot of airplay on John Peel.

23:32.608 --> 23:34.192
Simple Minds it is.

23:34.233 --> 23:36.483
Though, probably need
to change their name.

23:36.525 --> 23:37.733
Bit of a non-starter.

23:37.775 --> 23:39.358
Okay, well if you get them I'll go.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.108
But I've got a bit too much on

23:41.150 --> 23:43.442
right now to go on more dates.

23:43.483 --> 23:46.233
Also, no offense, but
you are incredibly slow.

23:46.275 --> 23:47.650
I've really got to get home.

23:47.692 --> 23:48.692
Got an early start.

23:48.733 --> 23:49.983
You know what uni's like.

23:50.025 --> 23:52.317
Course, aye, fair play.

23:52.358 --> 23:55.025
Thanks for a fun night

23:58.150 --> 23:59.067
Bye.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.442
Oh, hello there.

24:04.483 --> 24:06.275
I'm Anne, the wife.

24:06.317 --> 24:08.567
John never said he was married
to such a lovely lassie.

24:08.608 --> 24:11.358
Aye, well, he's got his
stud-like DJ image to protect.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.275
Davie, And this is my business associate.

24:13.317 --> 24:14.650
Yeah, I heard you made quite

24:14.692 --> 24:16.692
the impact on the uni disco scene.

24:16.733 --> 24:17.775
It was all on John, really.

24:17.817 --> 24:19.483
His gig, you know?

24:19.525 --> 24:20.317
It's all he's talked about.

24:21.192 --> 24:22.233
Nah, it's not.

24:22.275 --> 24:25.358
Anyway, I was going big
long before last night.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.025
Do you want a cup of tea?

24:28.067 --> 24:28.858
Tunnock's Caramel Wafer?

24:28.900 --> 24:29.692
- Smashing.
- Cracking.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.192
I'd like one an all, actually.

24:31.233 --> 24:32.900
Well you know where the kettle is.

24:32.942 --> 24:33.733
You just have to flick
the switch, and then,

24:33.775 --> 24:36.233
you pour the boiling water in the cup.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.233
And don't forget to add the tea bag.

24:39.275 --> 24:41.775
John, ask them to sit down.

24:41.817 --> 24:43.900
Take a seat then, lads.

24:47.025 --> 24:50.400
Don't you dare touch my wafer!

24:50.442 --> 24:52.275
How many tickets you shift, then?

24:52.317 --> 24:53.567
Full house eh.

24:53.608 --> 24:54.817
What did I tell you?

24:54.858 --> 24:57.650
Aye, but listen, I was
thinking, we should do it again.

24:57.692 --> 24:58.775
Not a chance.

24:58.817 --> 25:00.233
Eh?

25:00.275 --> 25:01.567
We got to do it bigger.

25:01.608 --> 25:02.983
The next level, John.

25:03.025 --> 25:03.817
We've got a good rep after last

25:03.858 --> 25:05.942
night, so we gotta capitalize.

25:05.983 --> 25:08.400
Put on proper bands, get
bigger crowds, more money.

25:08.442 --> 25:09.817
Hotter lassies.

25:09.858 --> 25:11.608
And less work for you.

25:11.650 --> 25:14.608
I quite enjoy the attention, eh?

25:14.650 --> 25:15.692
What was that John?

25:15.733 --> 25:18.608
I said, they've got my attention.

25:18.650 --> 25:19.608
Fucking hell, eh?

25:19.650 --> 25:21.400
What was that last bit John?

25:21.442 --> 25:22.567
Who are you thinking?

25:22.608 --> 25:23.733
Simple Minds?

25:23.775 --> 25:24.733
Never heard of them.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.483
Getting a lot of airplay
on John Peel, at the moment.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.817
Very popular with the young, hip crowd.

25:28.858 --> 25:30.817
That'll be you well
out the loop then, eh John?

25:32.275 --> 25:36.192
You'd like them but we need
a bit of money up front first.

25:36.233 --> 25:37.400
How much did we clear?

25:37.442 --> 25:39.733
Fifty after I bought
the strips for the team.

25:39.775 --> 25:41.233
Fifty?

25:41.275 --> 25:43.400
Can nay do much with that.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.858
Can ya double it?

25:51.483 --> 25:52.650
John, if you
so much as look at our

25:52.692 --> 25:56.192
Florida holiday fund, I will divorce you.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.567
Okay sweetheart?

26:02.275 --> 26:04.442
Got any contacts in the travel industry?

26:05.942 --> 26:07.525
Alright, do we all have our
tickets to see the Pope?

26:07.567 --> 26:08.650
Aye.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.233
And do we all have our
tickets ready for Rocket Travel?

26:10.275 --> 26:11.233
Aye.

26:11.275 --> 26:13.192
Excellent, now, if you could
all form an orderly queue,

26:13.233 --> 26:15.608
the bus should be here in,
as Our Grace would say,

26:15.650 --> 26:19.900
'Uno Momento'

26:19.942 --> 26:21.025
They're late.

26:21.067 --> 26:22.942
These boys reliable?

26:22.983 --> 26:24.983
This is the Kiss the Tarmac special.

26:25.025 --> 26:26.400
They're a new outfit, like us.

26:26.442 --> 26:27.233
You mean, the only one that would

26:27.275 --> 26:29.108
give you anything for fifty pound?

26:29.150 --> 26:31.358
Look smart arse, long
as it's got four wheels

26:31.400 --> 26:34.150
and glass windows, it'll be fine.

26:39.775 --> 26:41.108
It'll be fine.

26:42.358 --> 26:43.900
Fuckin' joking?

26:43.942 --> 26:44.983
No, I've told ya.

26:45.025 --> 26:47.733
This isn't the offices
of Rockit bloody Travel.

26:47.775 --> 26:48.650
I don't care if you missed half

26:48.692 --> 26:51.900
of the Pope's speech it's
nothing to do with me.

26:55.692 --> 26:57.025
Hello?

26:57.067 --> 26:58.650
Aye, Rockit Travel.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.025
Four Barry Manilow tickets?

27:01.067 --> 27:01.900
Dad.

27:03.108 --> 27:07.108
I told you, answer the phone correctly.

27:07.150 --> 27:08.733
Yes, and would that be the

27:08.775 --> 27:12.317
standard package, sir, or the deluxe?

27:12.358 --> 27:13.192
Yes.

27:14.067 --> 27:17.275
Just make the cheque
payable to Rockit Travel.

27:17.317 --> 27:18.900
5D Whitfield Court.

27:20.692 --> 27:22.775
Yes, thank you very much.

27:25.233 --> 27:27.983
Hey son, if I'm gonna be
answering these phones

27:28.025 --> 27:31.358
for you, I'm gonna need
some kind of remuneration.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
What you got in mind?

27:32.442 --> 27:34.108
Four tins of export a night?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.233
Ounce of Golden Virginia?

27:35.275 --> 27:37.608
Two tins and a half ounce.

27:43.650 --> 27:45.067
Pretty braw like.

27:46.358 --> 27:50.233
Aye, it's definitely
calming me down a bit.

27:50.275 --> 27:53.108
Nay bad stuff there, baby Scotty.

27:54.608 --> 27:57.608
Just go with the flow, boys, eh?

27:57.650 --> 27:58.567
See how you hold up.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.608
We need a name.

28:02.650 --> 28:03.483
Eh?

28:04.692 --> 28:05.858
Yeah, for the company.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.983
I was thinking about that.

28:08.025 --> 28:10.608
I was thinking, JSD Promotions.

28:11.442 --> 28:12.233
- Away.
- What?

28:12.275 --> 28:15.358
- You to fuck.
- I was just thinking.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.692
Okay, well done, clever
clogs, very original.

28:17.733 --> 28:21.025
But if anything, it
gonna be SJD productions?

28:21.067 --> 28:21.858
- What the fuck?
- I mean, come on, eh fuck.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.692
Who got all the posters?

28:22.733 --> 28:23.525
- Alright?
- You got one poster.

28:23.567 --> 28:24.608
Who sortied out the police light?

28:24.650 --> 28:25.525
Remember that Police Light,

28:25.567 --> 28:26.400
That was fuckin' class.

28:26.442 --> 28:28.483
No, No, no... whoa.

28:28.525 --> 28:31.275
No fucking initials, it's boring.

28:35.733 --> 28:36.733
Twa Bridges.

28:40.067 --> 28:41.817
Twa Bridges?

28:41.858 --> 28:42.692
Eh.

28:43.983 --> 28:47.067
Wee something my dad used to say, eh?

28:48.025 --> 28:52.525
Dundee's got twa bridges now
son, just like Edinburgh.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.108
Aye.

28:57.192 --> 28:59.692
Twa Bridges Promotions it is, then.

28:59.733 --> 29:00.900
Aye.

29:03.733 --> 29:05.942
Does anybody else
really fancy a cheeseburger?

29:05.983 --> 29:07.150
Aye!

29:11.067 --> 29:11.858
What you laughing at?

29:11.900 --> 29:12.983
I'm starving.

29:14.483 --> 29:16.150
You's two have got the munchies.

29:19.108 --> 29:19.900
The what?

29:19.942 --> 29:20.733
Dafties.

29:21.608 --> 29:22.442
Amateurs.

29:31.525 --> 29:33.692
What's happnenin' Kenny?

29:40.108 --> 29:41.692
We're after a venue

29:42.817 --> 29:44.358
We're looking to get
some stuff for it, and all.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.817
Get to fuck.

29:45.858 --> 29:47.067
We've got the money for it.

29:49.067 --> 29:51.483
I hear the student union
is more your level, boys.

29:51.525 --> 29:53.150
We're barred.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.108
Apparently

29:54.150 --> 29:56.858
Someone stole a police light for our gig.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.567
Old Jade here's mum was sorely
disappointed by her deluxe

29:59.608 --> 30:03.817
Barry Manilow experience, as
supplied by Rockit Travel.

30:03.858 --> 30:04.692
So,

30:06.108 --> 30:06.942
get to fuck.

30:06.983 --> 30:08.358
You want to cut the pish, mate?

30:08.400 --> 30:09.983
We heard you were a serious businessman.

30:11.442 --> 30:12.900
I like your girlfriend, Davie.

30:12.942 --> 30:13.775
Fiery.

30:14.650 --> 30:18.858
Do you not get in any
bother for doing that in here?

30:18.900 --> 30:20.942
Well, I'd have to kick myself
out, seein' as we own the place.

30:23.608 --> 30:24.858
You want any decent venue this time,

30:24.900 --> 30:28.150
you'll have to ask Des Fergie.

30:28.192 --> 30:29.233
Is he the guy puts his victims

30:29.275 --> 30:30.317
in a bathtub and fills it with...

30:30.358 --> 30:31.442
Aye.

30:39.900 --> 30:40.900
Wait here.

30:43.358 --> 30:45.692
The wee one's an accountant,
and the long streak

30:45.733 --> 30:48.442
of pish is a music journalist, apparently.

30:48.483 --> 30:50.650
Well, it was either that, jute, or jam.

30:50.692 --> 30:51.483
Funny.

30:51.525 --> 30:52.858
Is it?

30:52.900 --> 30:54.817
This is not Fergie

30:54.858 --> 30:56.108
That's a nice

30:57.567 --> 30:58.400
painting.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.567
It's Pike, his nephew.

31:01.608 --> 31:04.400
Oh, don't let that sweet smile fool ya.

31:04.442 --> 31:05.233
He does bite.

31:05.275 --> 31:08.025
Fuckin' sit down, then.

31:17.858 --> 31:21.442
So, is Mr. Fergie no here?

31:21.483 --> 31:24.233
Does it look like he is?

31:24.275 --> 31:26.775
It's Saturday.

31:26.817 --> 31:30.358
Mr. Fergie plays golf on a Saturday.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
Oh, right.

31:34.650 --> 31:35.817
They can have Teasers.

31:35.858 --> 31:39.317
Two hundred for every gig you put on.

31:39.358 --> 31:40.858
Now, the problem
with Dundee at the time

31:40.900 --> 31:43.733
was that all the best venues
were owned by these pricks.

31:43.775 --> 31:45.358
Off you go, then.

31:47.817 --> 31:50.775
So, inevitably,
when you cut a deal.

31:50.817 --> 31:51.983
It's stacked in their favour.

31:52.025 --> 31:52.942
We'll take half the door.

31:52.983 --> 31:53.775
- No, fuckin'...
- Half the...

31:53.817 --> 31:56.608
Sorry boys, I wasn't asking ya.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.775
I'm fucking telling ya.

31:58.817 --> 32:01.400
No if's, but's or post mortems.

32:03.858 --> 32:04.942
Toodle-loo!

32:15.317 --> 32:18.275
Kate Bush or Debbie Harry?

32:18.317 --> 32:19.400
For the music?

32:19.442 --> 32:21.192
Yes, for the music.

32:22.275 --> 32:24.233
I wouldn't say no to either.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.108
Davie.

32:27.192 --> 32:29.442
Elton John or the Bee Gees?

32:32.275 --> 32:33.442
Neither.

32:33.483 --> 32:35.358
You're meant to pick one.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.067
Gimme another one.

32:38.275 --> 32:41.108
The Undertones or the Buzzcocks?

32:44.317 --> 32:45.567
Buzzcocks.

32:45.608 --> 32:47.192
All right, my turn.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.650
Dundee or United?

32:50.692 --> 32:51.858
United what?

32:52.775 --> 32:54.858
Dundee United.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.650
You said Dundee or United

32:56.692 --> 32:57.733
Yeah, there's two teams.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.025
Dundee and Dundee United.

33:00.067 --> 33:01.275
The grounds are right across
the road from each other.

33:01.317 --> 33:04.483
Why would you need two Dundee teams?

33:06.108 --> 33:08.150
So we've always got
someone to play with.

33:11.192 --> 33:13.567
I didn't think much of
you when we first met.

33:13.608 --> 33:15.442
Aye, ye did.

33:15.483 --> 33:16.817
At the disco.

33:16.858 --> 33:17.650
Do you know what I thought of you,

33:17.692 --> 33:19.317
Davie, when we first met?

33:19.358 --> 33:20.650
What?

33:20.692 --> 33:22.650
I thought, he needs to roll his tongue

33:22.692 --> 33:25.608
back in before someone steps on it.

33:28.192 --> 33:30.567
Like you a lot more now, though.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.358
You better.

33:33.733 --> 33:38.067
Did you ever get around
to booking Simple Minds?

33:41.150 --> 33:42.483
Wait, how much?

33:45.067 --> 33:47.817
Let's make it 15 quid and 6 tins.

33:49.025 --> 33:49.858
Deal?

33:51.192 --> 33:55.567
I'll throw in 5 packs of chips
from the Deep Sea chipper.

33:55.608 --> 33:57.192
Ah, lovely.

33:57.233 --> 33:58.317
Good man, cheers.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.900
Hello, this is Davie McLean
from Twa Bridges Promotions.

34:05.942 --> 34:08.525
We'd look to book The Starjets.

34:10.025 --> 34:11.192
The Vapours.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.025
The Skids.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.733
Good man, thank you.

34:21.317 --> 34:23.442
Is XTC available?

34:34.692 --> 34:36.275
That's fantastic Scott.

34:36.317 --> 34:38.983
Yeah, that's dead smart, that.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.233
Where's the one for Very Important Men?

34:43.067 --> 34:45.442
I could only afford the one.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.858
Please dinn-y tell me you've blown

34:46.900 --> 34:49.650
our entire promo budget on
one bloody poster, Scott.

34:49.692 --> 34:51.733
It's no my fault.

34:51.775 --> 34:53.317
The boy at DC Thompson's wasn't cheap,

34:53.358 --> 34:55.275
and I had to pay Old Ralph extra,

34:55.317 --> 34:57.317
to get a guy in, recarbonate the printer.

34:59.567 --> 35:00.775
How many tickets did we shift?

35:00.817 --> 35:04.233
Well, with our one,
admittedly excellent, poster,

35:04.275 --> 35:08.025
none in Groucho's, none in Q
and I video, same in Rock Pile.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.692
And worst of all, none at the venue.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.108
Right, zero then.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.775
We're wiped out, we're still gonna have

35:12.817 --> 35:15.442
to pay two hundred quid for this place.

35:15.483 --> 35:16.275
Hang on.

35:16.317 --> 35:17.525
Got an idea.

35:17.567 --> 35:19.900
Gig cancelled, promoter dead.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.067
New poster.

35:24.775 --> 35:25.942
A bit basic.

35:26.775 --> 35:28.150
I've seen a few death
notices in the Tully.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.733
Needs more,

35:29.775 --> 35:30.608
feeling.

35:31.900 --> 35:32.692
"Due

35:33.942 --> 35:34.775
to the

35:37.275 --> 35:38.192
unfortunate

35:40.025 --> 35:40.858
demise.

35:42.108 --> 35:45.233
of the well liked and
respected local business man,

35:45.275 --> 35:48.775
Mr. John Gibson, 24, tonight's performance

35:48.817 --> 35:52.442
has been canceled as a mark of respect.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.275
All tickets will be
refunded by Rocket Travel.

35:55.317 --> 35:59.192
Our condolences to his
beloved wife, Anne."

35:59.233 --> 36:01.025
Fucking, nice one, John.

36:01.067 --> 36:01.942
You know mate, I didn't see you

36:01.983 --> 36:03.317
come up with anything, did I?

36:03.358 --> 36:04.275
John Gibson?

36:04.317 --> 36:05.108
I'm the man.

36:05.150 --> 36:06.942
Look awfully good for a dead man.

36:06.983 --> 36:08.608
A dead man that owes me two hundred bucks

36:08.650 --> 36:09.483
for cancelling a gig.

36:09.525 --> 36:10.525
It's no like that at all

36:10.567 --> 36:13.983
- I can get you the money.
- There you are.

36:18.025 --> 36:18.858
Right.

36:20.150 --> 36:20.942
Ta.

36:20.983 --> 36:21.817
Aye.

36:23.983 --> 36:25.650
Thanks Scott!

36:25.692 --> 36:27.358
Nay bother.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.733
We're equal partners, right?

36:30.817 --> 36:32.067
Win big on the horses, eh?

36:32.108 --> 36:33.317
Nope.

36:33.358 --> 36:37.275
Import/export business is booming.

36:37.317 --> 36:38.150
Eh?

36:39.733 --> 36:41.400
I'm selling loads of hash to students.

36:43.150 --> 36:44.483
I'm a student!

36:56.775 --> 36:58.567
Yeah, we're interested
in the two-tone package.

36:58.608 --> 37:01.817
The Specials and The Madness.

37:01.858 --> 37:03.858
Top man, thank you.

37:07.817 --> 37:09.983
Wreckless Eric.

37:10.025 --> 37:11.817
Excellent, thank you very much.

37:11.858 --> 37:13.442
Are you sure you're happy with VIM?

37:13.483 --> 37:14.983
Very Important Men's
a bit of a mouthful.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.900
We fancy a three-letter acronym.

37:16.942 --> 37:18.358
Three letter acronym's even worse.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.483
No, like ELO, OMD, XTC?

37:21.650 --> 37:22.692
AC-DC?

37:22.733 --> 37:23.525
Stop you there.

37:23.567 --> 37:24.608
You realize that VIM is a popular

37:24.650 --> 37:26.025
household cleaning product?

37:26.067 --> 37:27.525
It's a celebration of the mundane.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.192
Very Warholian.

37:29.233 --> 37:30.358
Might get yer 15 minutes of fame,

37:30.400 --> 37:32.567
but I think that'll be it.

37:34.567 --> 37:36.067
How much we got?

37:38.817 --> 37:41.400
Can you do it for 50?

37:42.275 --> 37:44.775
Is ULTRAVOX available?

37:44.817 --> 37:45.692
Wonderful.

37:45.733 --> 37:46.733
Before you go, Davie.

37:46.775 --> 37:48.817
What is it George? I'm
running out of ten pences.

37:48.858 --> 37:50.733
Got this new band, four-piece,

37:50.775 --> 37:51.942
out of Dublin, gonna be massive.

37:51.983 --> 37:52.900
Who are they?

37:52.942 --> 37:53.983
U2.

37:54.025 --> 37:54.817
Never heard of them.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.192
Sorry George, we'll have to pass.

38:00.775 --> 38:01.608
Nice.

38:02.608 --> 38:04.483
Thought we could make a bit
of extra money taping the gigs

38:04.525 --> 38:07.775
and selling the videos
to the young hip crowd.

38:07.817 --> 38:08.775
Where did ya get it from?

38:08.817 --> 38:09.817
Well, I borrowed the camera from

38:09.858 --> 38:12.400
that guy from Forbes over there.

38:12.442 --> 38:13.525
And I got a hundred blank cassettes

38:13.567 --> 38:16.233
from the guy from Woolies over there.

38:16.275 --> 38:17.942
How much?

38:17.983 --> 38:22.692
Free tickets, the other
half of my share, each.

38:22.733 --> 38:25.067
They both think they're
getting a half each?

38:25.108 --> 38:25.942
Aye.

38:27.483 --> 38:28.983
But they're actually
only getting a quarter.

38:29.025 --> 38:29.817
Aye, right.

38:29.858 --> 38:32.525
But keep it down, it'll be fine.

38:36.067 --> 38:37.817
Wonderful.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.108
Thank you, pleasure
doing business with you.

38:40.150 --> 38:40.942
Cheers, okay, goodbye now.

38:43.900 --> 38:44.692
Perm's in.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.900
Perm is not in.

38:46.942 --> 38:48.608
Perm is in.

38:48.650 --> 38:49.983
John, look at me.

38:50.025 --> 38:51.733
- I am lookin' at ya.
- I'm beautiful.

38:54.067 --> 38:54.900
Quite stunning.

38:54.942 --> 38:57.025
- Aye, sure.
- If I do say so myself.

38:57.067 --> 38:58.150
Aye, you do say so yourself.

38:58.192 --> 38:59.442
Build up your
strength slowly, now.

38:59.483 --> 39:00.858
Don't run before you can walk.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.650
I'll keep him right, doctor.

39:03.692 --> 39:04.858
Cheers, doc.

39:07.275 --> 39:08.817
How you feeling?

39:08.858 --> 39:10.525
Brand new.

39:11.775 --> 39:12.608
Davie.

39:13.692 --> 39:14.483
I'm wearing heels.

39:17.067 --> 39:18.317
You heard the doctor, you shouldn't.

39:18.358 --> 39:19.858
Aw, pish.

39:19.900 --> 39:20.692
Oh Shona, it's goin', it's goin'.

39:20.733 --> 39:21.567
Davie.

39:23.025 --> 39:24.775
What you doing, you weirdo?

39:24.817 --> 39:25.983
I just wanted to thank ya.

39:26.025 --> 39:27.025
For what?

39:27.067 --> 39:28.150
Nursing me.

39:28.192 --> 39:29.400
Davie, that's my job.

39:29.442 --> 39:30.608
And for all this music promo stuff.

39:30.650 --> 39:33.192
You kind of inspired me.

39:33.233 --> 39:34.358
I'm flattered, but,

39:34.400 --> 39:35.817
So,

39:36.692 --> 39:37.942
I got you this.

39:40.358 --> 39:43.275
Davie, that's really sweet.

39:43.317 --> 39:44.150
I know.

39:45.942 --> 39:47.025
Where are you going?

39:47.067 --> 39:50.108
We're going to celebrate.

39:50.150 --> 39:51.400
Cool.

39:56.483 --> 39:58.442
Oh, that is horrific.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.358
That poor girl.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.192
Stop it.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.108
Stop it.

40:04.817 --> 40:06.150
I would like to apologize once again,

40:06.192 --> 40:08.692
sir, for the fois-gras and quail soup

40:08.733 --> 40:10.692
not being available this evening.

40:10.733 --> 40:12.317
It's nay bother, pal.

40:12.358 --> 40:13.483
Had that last night at home anyway.

40:15.150 --> 40:16.650
Enjoy your meal.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.817
We love the seeds, don't we, Davie.

40:28.858 --> 40:31.983
Hey, I love the lemon.

40:32.025 --> 40:33.608
It's the best part.

40:37.025 --> 40:39.692
So why are you doing all this?

40:42.983 --> 40:44.733
Because I like you.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.317
Not that, I mean the music stuff.

40:52.067 --> 40:54.817
It makes me a wee bit of money.

40:54.858 --> 40:57.108
I kinda like it, I suppose.

40:58.692 --> 41:03.358
Yeah but, what does it mean,
what do you want from it?

41:04.733 --> 41:08.983
I've never really thought
about it, to be honest.

41:23.275 --> 41:26.942
Mum's always fancied a
house down the ferry.

41:28.608 --> 41:30.858
I would love to get her it.

41:32.483 --> 41:33.983
Make my dad proud.

41:36.442 --> 41:38.442
Just support the family.

41:42.983 --> 41:45.150
Maybe start one of my own.

41:53.442 --> 41:55.150
Everything
to your satisfaction?

41:55.192 --> 41:56.233
Aye, fine and dandy, pal.

41:56.275 --> 41:58.233
Can you get us another bottle of Chabliss?

42:00.108 --> 42:01.900
He means Chablis.

42:01.942 --> 42:02.942
Of course.

42:06.317 --> 42:07.108
Cha-what?

42:07.150 --> 42:09.483
Chablis, it's French.

42:09.525 --> 42:10.317
French.

42:13.567 --> 42:16.525
John, the boy from Woolies is here.

42:16.567 --> 42:20.650
He says he wants half your
money from last night.

42:22.067 --> 42:22.942
Eh?

42:22.983 --> 42:25.567
You can have Bloomers for four hundred.

42:25.608 --> 42:27.108
Cash, up front.

42:27.150 --> 42:28.400
Canna do that.

42:28.442 --> 42:32.150
Just when things are starting
to go well, cue Fergie.

42:32.192 --> 42:34.067
We started to sell out
venues, pulling bigger

42:34.108 --> 42:35.942
and better bands, so, it was only a matter

42:35.983 --> 42:38.400
of time before people
started to take notice.

42:38.442 --> 42:39.233
Davie McLean.

42:39.275 --> 42:40.775
- Remember this prick?
- How's business?

42:40.817 --> 42:41.775
Better be good.

42:41.817 --> 42:44.067
Aye, business is good.

42:44.108 --> 42:46.733
Well, when you begin to swim deeper,

42:46.775 --> 42:49.275
don't be surprised when
you meet the sharks.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.775
Mr. McConnel informs me the Thin Lizzy

42:51.817 --> 42:53.692
tickets are selling like hot cakes.

42:53.733 --> 42:57.108
Not my cup of tea, but
the Mrs. quite likes them.

42:57.150 --> 42:58.650
This is Fergie, by the way.

42:58.692 --> 43:01.483
The chief potato of Dundee's McMafia.

43:01.525 --> 43:02.817
You can pretty much write what he kens

43:02.858 --> 43:05.150
about the music scene
on the back of a stamp.

43:05.192 --> 43:08.150
She's got good taste,
tickets are almost sold out.

43:08.192 --> 43:08.983
Excellent.

43:09.025 --> 43:12.108
We'll take the advance sales
now, then, since we're here.

43:12.150 --> 43:13.150
I'll just check with Bernie.

43:13.192 --> 43:15.400
It was Bernie who suggested it.

43:15.442 --> 43:16.483
But he owns all the venues,

43:16.525 --> 43:18.900
so what he say's basically goes.

43:18.942 --> 43:20.525
Anyway, he comes later.

43:20.567 --> 43:22.983
- Hi.
- So, we meet our new contact,

43:23.025 --> 43:25.067
talk a bit of shit.

43:25.108 --> 43:26.233
- A deal is agreed,
- I'll give you

43:26.275 --> 43:27.567
my London contacts.

43:27.608 --> 43:28.442
Excellent.

43:28.483 --> 43:29.317
And then, you're off, off, and away

43:29.358 --> 43:31.525
with your biggest gig yet.

43:32.900 --> 43:33.733
Until.

43:35.525 --> 43:37.025
There a band on here tonight?

43:37.067 --> 43:37.858
Just in time, pal.

43:37.900 --> 43:38.775
Tickets are selling fast.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.358
Right, well it's off.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.192
What?

43:41.233 --> 43:43.775
You can't have a big gig
in such a built-up area.

43:43.817 --> 43:45.108
That's never
been a problem before.

43:45.150 --> 43:45.942
Well it is now.

43:45.983 --> 43:46.942
You cannae do that!

43:46.983 --> 43:49.983
It's done. Order of the Council.

43:50.025 --> 43:52.358
Bit of a coincidence don't you think?

43:52.400 --> 43:53.525
Nah, not really.

43:53.567 --> 43:55.942
Fucking jobsworth cock wobble.

43:55.983 --> 43:57.525
Probably working for Fergie.

43:57.567 --> 43:58.900
Oh, aye, hows that?

43:58.942 --> 44:00.775
We need a new venue
at short notice, right?

44:00.817 --> 44:04.108
We're desperate, so
he'll make us pay more.

44:04.150 --> 44:05.650
We should just quit, eh?

44:05.692 --> 44:07.358
Do something safer.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.192
Aye, like What?

44:08.233 --> 44:09.025
Well, I've been thinking.

44:09.067 --> 44:10.358
What time does your Anne go to work?

44:10.400 --> 44:11.233
8:30.

44:11.275 --> 44:12.317
And when does she get back?

44:12.358 --> 44:13.400
5:30

44:13.442 --> 44:16.525
Good, so, your house is empty for, say,

44:16.567 --> 44:17.567
Nine hours every day.

44:17.608 --> 44:19.192
Right.

44:19.233 --> 44:21.025
Nice house, by the way.

44:21.067 --> 44:22.483
Is it?

44:22.525 --> 44:23.733
Double bed?

44:23.775 --> 44:25.150
Aye, Slumberland.

44:25.192 --> 44:25.983
Comfy?

44:26.025 --> 44:26.858
Very.

44:27.775 --> 44:29.733
Let's open up it up as a brothel.

44:29.775 --> 44:30.900
That better be a fucking joke, Scott.

44:30.942 --> 44:33.067
Right, calm down mate.

44:33.108 --> 44:35.692
I wasn't gonna suggest Anne.

44:35.733 --> 44:37.608
But that Shona's a bonny lass, though.

44:37.650 --> 44:39.567
If you want a seat at Fergie's table,

44:39.608 --> 44:41.108
Call that plan B for now, eh?

44:41.150 --> 44:44.942
Albeit a wobbly one, you
have to play by his rules.

44:44.983 --> 44:47.192
Indeed, what can you do?

44:47.233 --> 44:50.192
It's not as if you can go and
complain to trading standards.

44:50.233 --> 44:53.442
My best advice here, is to
lie down and bite the pillow.

44:53.483 --> 44:55.025
Lads, you're the ones
that are gonna have

44:55.067 --> 44:57.233
to hurt them if they don't pay.

44:57.275 --> 44:58.983
The amount of students
without collateral that I've had

44:59.025 --> 45:02.983
to snap the bones off is
really starting to annoy me.

45:03.025 --> 45:04.733
I mean, I don't even
go to the gym anymore.

45:04.775 --> 45:06.692
I own a house.

45:08.525 --> 45:10.025
What?

45:10.067 --> 45:11.067
You heard.

45:30.108 --> 45:30.900
Glad you came.

45:30.942 --> 45:31.775
You look awfully bonny.

45:31.817 --> 45:35.650
This has to be your last gig, Davie.

45:35.692 --> 45:36.483
Why?

45:36.525 --> 45:39.067
Finally recognized
that guy the other day.

45:39.108 --> 45:41.775
Only it wasn't what he
looked like, but his name.

45:41.817 --> 45:43.108
Des Fergie.

45:43.150 --> 45:44.525
I know what I'm doing.

45:44.567 --> 45:46.650
Sure, my patients thought that, too.

45:46.692 --> 45:49.025
When I was treating broken
bones in the hospital,

45:49.067 --> 45:50.525
I'd hear whispers, people would say things

45:50.567 --> 45:52.525
when they were out of it
then clam up the next day.

45:52.567 --> 45:54.983
But it was always the same name.

45:55.025 --> 45:58.275
It's just reminds me of the
shit I grew up with back home.

45:58.317 --> 45:59.150
My dad.

46:00.942 --> 46:02.608
And if you're part of that,
Davie, or if that could

46:02.650 --> 46:06.817
hurt you, then I'm sorry,
but we can't be friends.

46:09.025 --> 46:10.108
Just found the one thing I'm good at,

46:10.150 --> 46:12.108
and you want me to quit?

46:12.150 --> 46:12.942
I'll be shining bright.

46:12.983 --> 46:14.067
You're right.

46:14.108 --> 46:18.525
In fact, I've got no idea
why I thought you'd listen.

46:20.942 --> 46:21.775
Shona.

46:24.733 --> 46:26.108
Davie.

46:26.150 --> 46:27.983
Finally ditched that wee whore, eh.

46:28.025 --> 46:29.608
What was I thinking?

46:29.650 --> 46:31.025
- Glad-
- You probably did me a favour.

46:31.067 --> 46:31.900
Glad I could help, pal.

46:31.942 --> 46:35.567
Besides, you put on some
decent gigs on these days.

46:35.608 --> 46:36.400
Cheers, Malky.

46:36.442 --> 46:37.400
Two secs, eh?

46:37.442 --> 46:38.275
Shona.

46:41.775 --> 46:42.608
Fuck.

48:16.692 --> 48:17.733
Good afternoon, Mr. Burton's office.

48:17.775 --> 48:19.942
Annabelle speaking, how may I help you?

48:19.983 --> 48:23.775
Hello, David McLean from
Twa Bridges Promotions.

48:23.817 --> 48:24.650
Who?

48:26.525 --> 48:27.317
Twa Bridges Promotions.

48:27.358 --> 48:28.900
We're the biggest promotions
company in Dundee.

48:28.942 --> 48:30.025
Dundee?

48:30.067 --> 48:32.692
Dundee, East of Scotland.

48:32.733 --> 48:33.983
What is it concerning?

48:34.025 --> 48:34.858
We would like to book Pink Floyd,

48:34.900 --> 48:37.317
the Stones and Fleetwood Mac.

48:38.733 --> 48:40.983
Okay, I'll put you
through to Mr. Burton.

48:41.025 --> 48:43.150
Where did you disappear to?

48:43.192 --> 48:44.483
Up the blackie, down the hockie.

48:44.525 --> 48:46.400
Well, club's fucked.

48:46.442 --> 48:47.233
You even slept?

48:48.650 --> 48:50.400
Burton speaking.

48:50.442 --> 48:53.775
Hello, This is David McLean
from Twa Bridges Promotions.

48:53.817 --> 48:55.567
Never heard of you.

48:55.608 --> 48:57.025
We're the premiere
music promotion company

48:57.067 --> 48:58.983
in Dundee, and we'd like
to book one of your acts.

48:59.025 --> 49:00.317
Name any venue a hundred mile radius

49:00.358 --> 49:01.567
from Tannadice, and we'll fill it.

49:01.608 --> 49:02.400
We've got dens...

49:02.442 --> 49:04.525
Still never heard of
you, but here's the deal.

49:04.567 --> 49:06.358
It'll cost you a thousand pounds a mile

49:06.400 --> 49:10.317
to book any of our top acts, round trip.

49:10.358 --> 49:11.858
Can I make some calculations
and get back to you?

49:11.900 --> 49:13.817
No, I'm expecting a call.

49:13.858 --> 49:14.817
Would you hold please?

49:14.858 --> 49:16.650
Not really.

49:16.692 --> 49:17.858
Get an AA map and a ruler, pronto.

49:17.900 --> 49:18.817
On it.

49:18.858 --> 49:20.525
Howl, two well-fired rolls with butter.

49:20.567 --> 49:22.275
Plenty of salt.

49:22.317 --> 49:23.317
Annabelle.

49:25.650 --> 49:27.400
Where the fuck is Dundee?

49:27.442 --> 49:28.442
Scotland.

49:28.483 --> 49:30.817
Get me the AA map, please.

49:31.942 --> 49:32.733
Jesus, that was quick!

49:32.775 --> 49:33.567
Swiped it out a car.

49:33.608 --> 49:35.108
And a ruler?

49:35.150 --> 49:36.525
Thousand pounds per mile, is that correct?

49:36.567 --> 49:37.817
Here, mate.

49:37.858 --> 49:39.525
How long are those sausages?

49:39.567 --> 49:40.358
Six inches.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.608
Right, one please.

49:41.650 --> 49:43.483
You want chips with that?

49:43.525 --> 49:45.900
How long are the chips?

49:45.942 --> 49:48.233
Single mate, pronto!

49:48.275 --> 49:51.608
So is that by road or as the crow flies?

49:51.650 --> 49:53.483
Whichever's longest.

49:55.817 --> 49:58.067
Five hundred pounds a mile.

49:59.483 --> 50:00.400
I'll mortgage my house.

50:00.442 --> 50:01.233
What's it worth?

50:01.275 --> 50:02.067
Three grand.

50:02.108 --> 50:02.900
Three grand?

50:02.942 --> 50:04.233
That'll get them up to Swiss Cottage.

50:04.275 --> 50:05.358
He want's about a million quid.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.442
Don't eat that!

50:06.483 --> 50:07.692
Okay, I've just been speaking
with my business associates,

50:07.733 --> 50:08.775
and we've decided we would book

50:08.817 --> 50:10.650
one of your more up-and-coming bands.

50:10.692 --> 50:13.442
Someone like, say, Iron Maiden?

50:14.817 --> 50:18.442
Ah yes, they'd be just
the ticket so to speak.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.317
Persistent little bastard aren't you?

50:20.358 --> 50:22.233
I prefer ambitious.

50:22.275 --> 50:25.567
Right, that'll be fifteen
hundred pounds each way,

50:25.608 --> 50:29.233
provided they fancy a trip to Dundee.

50:29.275 --> 50:32.942
Let's round it off to, say, four K total?

50:32.983 --> 50:34.150
Very reasonable for
an act of that caliber.

50:34.192 --> 50:37.275
Okay, we'll need half
the money up front,

50:37.317 --> 50:38.692
sort the balance on the day.

50:38.733 --> 50:40.233
Excellent, Mr. Burton,
thank you very much, I'll...

50:45.192 --> 50:47.233
Iron fucking Maiden, ya dancer.

50:47.275 --> 50:48.150
Who?

50:48.192 --> 50:49.108
Four grand! Two up front.

50:49.150 --> 50:49.942
Who?

50:49.983 --> 50:50.983
Bargain.

50:51.025 --> 50:52.233
Bargain?

50:52.275 --> 50:54.025
What happened to the day of fifteen quid

50:54.067 --> 50:56.025
and a six cans of Skol for Simple Minds?

50:56.067 --> 50:58.733
That was last week John, this is now.

50:58.775 --> 51:01.442
With my mortgage and
last night's takings,

51:01.483 --> 51:02.567
we're still about five hundred short.

51:02.608 --> 51:03.942
Don't worry, I'll sort that.

51:03.983 --> 51:06.817
Put this back where you got it.

51:06.858 --> 51:07.775
Clean up the venue from last night,

51:07.817 --> 51:10.150
and eat that fucking sausage.

51:10.192 --> 51:11.150
Did he just tell me to clean the venue?

51:14.192 --> 51:17.817
You should see the size
of his fucking chips.

51:17.858 --> 51:20.650
I'm glad you came
back to me again, Davie.

51:20.692 --> 51:22.067
I think you and I, we're going to be

51:22.108 --> 51:24.817
working together for a long time.

51:24.858 --> 51:26.525
Aye, well I tried the usual routes.

51:26.567 --> 51:30.067
Lloyds TSB, RBS, but they all said no, eh?

51:30.983 --> 51:32.525
Pike.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.108
Backseat.

51:53.233 --> 51:55.108
Mr. McConnel in?

51:55.150 --> 51:56.525
Bernie.

51:56.567 --> 51:58.233
There a problem, Mr. Fergie?

51:58.275 --> 51:59.858
Not yet.

51:59.900 --> 52:00.692
Des?

52:02.192 --> 52:03.775
Can I help?

52:03.817 --> 52:06.608
Here for the four grand owed
from the Thin Lizzy concert.

52:06.650 --> 52:08.150
You mean the outstanding thousand?

52:08.192 --> 52:10.483
I gave Mr. Pike the rest.

52:14.025 --> 52:16.692
Don't have a receipt for that.

52:18.400 --> 52:21.233
Do you have a receipt, Mr. Pike?

52:21.275 --> 52:23.775
No idea what she's on about.

52:27.483 --> 52:29.858
She's ripping you off, Mr. McConnel.

52:29.900 --> 52:30.692
Hang on a minute.

52:30.733 --> 52:32.483
- There...
- Money, now!

52:33.442 --> 52:34.817
He was there and all!

52:34.858 --> 52:36.775
Davie, tell them, please.

52:36.817 --> 52:39.900
This fuckin' true, Davie?

52:53.442 --> 52:54.275
That,

52:55.317 --> 52:57.858
for keeping yer puss shut.

52:59.567 --> 53:00.733
Want a lift?

53:01.608 --> 53:02.442
Aye.

53:03.650 --> 53:06.275
Get a taxi, you can afford it now.

53:06.317 --> 53:10.317
Kenny'll be round for
all the money next week.

53:17.483 --> 53:19.108
What would you have done?

53:19.150 --> 53:20.983
Fergie knew exactly what he was doing.

53:21.025 --> 53:23.067
I still didn't have enough for the gig,

53:23.108 --> 53:25.400
so I turned to the only thing I knew.

53:25.442 --> 53:26.275
Come on.

53:27.275 --> 53:28.108
Come on.

53:28.150 --> 53:29.192
Fuck.

53:29.233 --> 53:31.150
Aye, did ye lose son?

53:32.400 --> 53:33.400
20 pound, Davie.

53:33.442 --> 53:35.025
Seen you lose a lot more than that

53:35.067 --> 53:35.983
Fuck off.

54:20.900 --> 54:21.733
One.

54:23.192 --> 54:24.025
Two.

54:26.858 --> 54:27.692
99.

54:28.858 --> 54:29.692
100.

54:32.442 --> 54:34.775
Bet ye can nay do that, son.

54:36.733 --> 54:38.692
Aye, right enough, Dad.

54:38.733 --> 54:41.108
Good night tonight?

54:41.150 --> 54:42.733
Sold the place out.

54:42.775 --> 54:44.358
Well done, son.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.567
Awfully proud.

54:47.775 --> 54:48.942
Cheers, Dad.

55:23.525 --> 55:24.942
Aye, he's here.

55:36.525 --> 55:38.400
Ya all right?

55:38.442 --> 55:39.275
Dandy.

55:41.358 --> 55:42.567
Beano and all.

55:42.608 --> 55:45.192
Where the fuck have you been?

55:46.067 --> 55:47.483
How you doing, John?

55:47.525 --> 55:48.608
Me?

55:48.650 --> 55:49.442
I'm doing great.

55:50.608 --> 55:53.733
After you left us, and
took all the fucking money.

55:53.775 --> 55:56.858
Calm down John, he's
obviously no doing so good.

55:56.900 --> 55:58.525
He's no doing so good?

56:00.108 --> 56:02.358
I'm the stupid fucker that
raided my holiday fund to pay off

56:02.400 --> 56:06.567
the local psychos so they don't
come back and break bones.

56:06.608 --> 56:07.900
And I couldn't pay them all, Davie.

56:07.942 --> 56:09.567
So, not only are those nutters coming back

56:09.608 --> 56:11.275
to do who-the-fuck-kens-what to us,

56:11.317 --> 56:14.900
but if my darling wife looks
in that vase, I'm divorced.

56:14.942 --> 56:16.358
Simple as.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.650
So Scott, just think again and tell me,

56:18.692 --> 56:22.442
out of everyone here,
who's no doing so good?

56:25.025 --> 56:28.025
You've got the money, right Davie?

56:33.608 --> 56:34.442
Bookies?

56:38.025 --> 56:39.442
In your own time, Davie.

56:39.483 --> 56:41.608
You complete and utter fanny.

56:44.317 --> 56:46.275
Put this all on black please.

56:46.317 --> 56:48.358
Okay, sir.

56:54.817 --> 56:55.650
19 red.

56:59.108 --> 56:59.900
Is that it?

56:59.942 --> 57:01.317
Yep.

57:01.358 --> 57:02.317
Okay, maybe I could have

57:02.358 --> 57:03.692
handled that a bit better.

57:03.733 --> 57:05.150
You've killed us, Davie.

57:05.192 --> 57:07.525
- Let me at him.
- Just leave it.

57:07.567 --> 57:09.067
It's not worth it.

57:10.525 --> 57:11.733
Just hit us, I deserve it.

57:11.775 --> 57:13.692
You know, there is no
point, you won't learn.

57:13.733 --> 57:15.400
Aye, he fuckin' will.

57:18.025 --> 57:21.317
Time to hurt like fuck, wee man.

57:21.358 --> 57:23.192
Listen, Pike mate, I
can get ya the money.

57:23.233 --> 57:24.275
I can work for you.

57:24.317 --> 57:28.650
Aye, you'll be working for
us for a long time, mate.

57:28.692 --> 57:29.567
Come on, pal.

57:29.608 --> 57:31.400
Might as well make this part easy.

57:31.442 --> 57:34.233
Hey lads, hows it going?

57:35.108 --> 57:36.858
What happened, Davie? You been fighting?

57:39.483 --> 57:41.983
Can you strong gentlemen help?

57:44.525 --> 57:45.317
Excuse us, we need to have

57:45.358 --> 57:47.108
a wee word with Davie, here.

57:47.150 --> 57:48.983
Are you taking him to the hospital?

57:49.025 --> 57:50.025
We'll see.

57:51.150 --> 57:54.067
John pal, have a wee word, and all.

57:56.483 --> 57:59.483
Look after him please, boys.

57:59.525 --> 58:03.025
Maybe we can have some fun
later if Davie's still up to it?

58:03.067 --> 58:04.483
Nay bad, Davie.

58:07.025 --> 58:09.067
Call the police, Scott.

58:09.108 --> 58:10.567
Nay point.

58:10.608 --> 58:13.108
They'd be too late, anyway.

58:13.150 --> 58:17.775
And if they dinn-y kill us,
we'd just be pissing them off.

58:25.733 --> 58:27.567
So, beverage?

58:27.608 --> 58:29.317
I'm cool, Mrs Fergie.

58:29.358 --> 58:30.233
Chrissie.

58:30.275 --> 58:34.192
Please don't trouble
yourself, Mrs. Chrissie.

58:35.233 --> 58:37.650
It's a lovely house you have.

58:38.692 --> 58:40.900
Aw, I like this one.

58:42.150 --> 58:43.483
Boys?

58:43.525 --> 58:45.650
No, mustn't drink on the job.

58:45.692 --> 58:47.650
Suit yourselves.

58:47.692 --> 58:51.858
♪ You held my dreams ♪

58:51.900 --> 58:56.900
♪ Like worthless grains of sand ♪

58:59.317 --> 59:04.317
♪ Careless hands don't care
when dreams slip through ♪

59:13.567 --> 59:15.983
What's the debt?

59:16.025 --> 59:17.858
Two hundred outstanding,

59:17.900 --> 59:19.942
five hundred from the Thin Lizzy gig,

59:19.983 --> 59:22.817
plus three days compound interest.

59:24.442 --> 59:27.650
I've also had a bill for repairs that

59:27.692 --> 59:30.567
need carried out on Bloomers.

59:30.608 --> 59:31.525
Aye, but that was nay our fault.

59:31.567 --> 59:32.483
How much?

59:33.525 --> 59:34.317
2,000.

59:35.192 --> 59:37.608
That's more than the place is worth.

59:37.650 --> 59:40.317
And a drum kit and a guitar.

59:41.942 --> 59:45.692
So, rounded up, you pair
of pricks now owe me

59:47.567 --> 59:49.108
three large.

59:49.150 --> 59:51.317
Three grand?

59:51.358 --> 59:54.108
On my desk, end of the week.

59:54.150 --> 59:55.108
This is bullshit,
Fergie, you've set us up.

59:58.942 --> 01:00:02.442
I've given you every chance, son.

01:00:02.483 --> 01:00:06.483
But you've let your
ambition blind your ability.

01:00:09.692 --> 01:00:13.400
You may as well kill us
now, we're as good as dead.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:14.525
No, no, no.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.067
You're dead when I say you are.

01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:23.650
If you fail to pay me back my money,

01:00:23.692 --> 01:00:26.692
then you can both come work on shipments.

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:32.108
Well, one of you, anyway.

01:00:34.442 --> 01:00:36.067
I'll let Mr. Pike here decide which

01:00:36.108 --> 01:00:39.483
of you needs to remain
in a useful condition.

01:00:39.525 --> 01:00:41.067
Tough choice.

01:00:41.108 --> 01:00:45.483
They're both as much use as
an ashtray on a motorbike.

01:00:46.858 --> 01:00:47.900
Look, I can do this.

01:00:47.942 --> 01:00:49.317
I can get you the money
in two weeks, okay?

01:00:49.358 --> 01:00:51.275
I'll mortgage my house.

01:00:56.733 --> 01:00:58.233
Two weeks it is.

01:01:00.983 --> 01:01:01.900
Problem is,

01:01:04.358 --> 01:01:07.483
I've got a bit of a reputation.

01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:09.400
Wonderful things, reputations.

01:01:11.525 --> 01:01:14.192
Usually save a lot of time.

01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:17.983
But now, my fucking rep
with the young crowd,

01:01:20.733 --> 01:01:22.317
it needs. a little,

01:01:24.567 --> 01:01:25.567
Finessing.

01:01:28.442 --> 01:01:32.567
So, with that in mind,
I'm going to leave you

01:01:32.608 --> 01:01:36.692
in the capable hands of
Mr Pike and Mr. Ferguson.

01:01:54.608 --> 01:01:56.525
Think they'll make it back?

01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:58.400
They're strong boys.

01:01:59.567 --> 01:02:00.358
As long it's some time

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.025
in the next couple weeks, I suppose.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.275
This isn't helping anything.

01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:44.858
We need to get home!

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:45.650
Fuck!

01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:52.900
Shut yer puss it's not funny.

01:02:54.692 --> 01:02:56.442
How'd you ken we would be here?

01:02:56.483 --> 01:02:58.858
Ah, Fergie
does this all the time.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.733
Fucking Baltic.

01:03:00.775 --> 01:03:02.317
What's the score then?

01:03:02.358 --> 01:03:03.483
I'll mortgage my house.

01:03:03.525 --> 01:03:05.983
Oh, above and beyond, mate.

01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:07.525
For someone who's friend
just saved your life,

01:03:07.567 --> 01:03:08.733
you don't look too happy, Davie.

01:03:08.775 --> 01:03:10.525
I'd have sorted it.

01:03:12.483 --> 01:03:14.442
You going to thank me?

01:03:14.483 --> 01:03:15.400
For what?

01:03:17.733 --> 01:03:19.817
Stopping you getting seriously hurt.

01:03:19.858 --> 01:03:21.400
By dressing like a whore, aye no bother.

01:03:21.442 --> 01:03:22.692
See, Shona I
think you look brilliant-

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:23.983
- Like a whore?

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:27.025
Look at the state of
yourself right now Davie.

01:03:27.067 --> 01:03:28.650
And you're calling me a slut?

01:03:28.692 --> 01:03:29.817
Guys, is this the appropriate time

01:03:29.858 --> 01:03:30.650
to be having this conversation?

01:03:30.692 --> 01:03:31.525
I didn't say you were a slut.

01:03:31.567 --> 01:03:32.733
I said you dressed like one.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.942
I dressed like this to help you.

01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:36.400
Cause' you're a degenerate gambler

01:03:36.442 --> 01:03:38.858
with delusions of grandeur.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.692
Very poetic.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:40.525
McGonnigal lives on, eh?

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.942
Would they have hurt you badly

01:03:43.983 --> 01:03:46.317
if I didn't dress like this?

01:03:48.317 --> 01:03:49.150
Exactly.

01:03:51.983 --> 01:03:53.567
Fuckin' hell.

01:03:53.608 --> 01:03:54.442
Shit.

01:03:58.817 --> 01:04:00.567
Fancy an ice cream?

01:04:01.483 --> 01:04:03.233
Raspberry sauce.

01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:04.525
Come on you.

01:04:04.567 --> 01:04:05.650
Cheer up, eh?

01:04:12.483 --> 01:04:13.608
Great acoustics.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:14.525
Maiden'll love it.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.650
It's our only option John.

01:04:19.692 --> 01:04:22.900
Our only option is
to forget all this music promo

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:26.692
pish and quit whilst we're only
heavily behind as opposed to dead.

01:04:26.733 --> 01:04:28.900
Just, hear me out first.

01:04:35.233 --> 01:04:40.317
Take your mortgage money,
stick on Iron Maiden here,

01:04:40.358 --> 01:04:43.650
sell the place out, pay
back crazy eyes and his band

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:47.067
of merry nut jobs, we make a tidy profit.

01:04:47.108 --> 01:04:49.858
And we all live happily ever after?

01:04:51.275 --> 01:04:52.275
I fucked up,

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:54.817
and I'm sorry.

01:05:03.192 --> 01:05:04.442
It's alright.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.858
I cannae risk anymore, all right?

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.858
My partner said the same thing

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.150
when we put on The Beatles.

01:05:17.483 --> 01:05:19.192
Alright there, mister?

01:05:19.233 --> 01:05:20.483
Andy, please.

01:05:21.692 --> 01:05:23.692
Just doing a wee recce,
make sure the place

01:05:23.733 --> 01:05:26.650
is spic and span for Sidney Devine.

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.608
Oh aye, big time stuff.

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:31.942
I had the Fab Four up for a couple

01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:35.733
of small shows in '63,
before they were huge.

01:05:36.858 --> 01:05:39.858
Only cost 30 pounds,
and we still lost money.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.358
But there was something about them

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.108
that meant I wanted them back.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.025
What was it?

01:05:47.067 --> 01:05:51.067
Well, they were the
bloody Beatles weren't they?

01:05:51.108 --> 01:05:54.525
So, I phoned up Brian Epstein and I said,

01:05:55.567 --> 01:05:59.108
"I'll take them again,
but we lost money before,

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.025
"so can we have them
for twenty five pound?"

01:06:02.067 --> 01:06:03.483
And he said, "No...

01:06:05.275 --> 01:06:06.733
You can have them for two
hundred pound, you have to

01:06:06.775 --> 01:06:10.025
"put them on at the biggest
venue you can find."

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:14.608
Well, my business partner,
he just thought I was nuts.

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:19.483
He's got two kids, so from
his point of view, it was.

01:06:19.525 --> 01:06:20.858
What happened?

01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:26.900
Well, it was the
bloody Beatles wasn't it?

01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:31.942
I was there as a laddie,
throwing Jelly Babies at Ringo.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.233
So,

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:35.650
Iron Maiden.

01:06:36.567 --> 01:06:38.983
The new wave of heavy metal.

01:06:39.025 --> 01:06:40.608
You going to do it?

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.483
For fuck sake.

01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:55.650
Fucking brilliant, John.

01:06:55.692 --> 01:06:56.983
You'll not regret it!

01:06:57.025 --> 01:06:58.650
Aye, well, I regret it already.

01:06:58.692 --> 01:06:59.900
You know what I'd regret?

01:06:59.942 --> 01:07:01.650
Buying that fucking coat.

01:07:01.692 --> 01:07:02.608
Fuck you.

01:07:19.358 --> 01:07:20.608
All right, Kev!

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:21.483
All right Davie.

01:07:21.525 --> 01:07:22.567
What's the book?

01:07:22.608 --> 01:07:25.233
It's the Gulag Archipelago.

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:26.150
It's about,

01:07:26.192 --> 01:07:29.233
ken the labor camps in Siberia?

01:07:29.275 --> 01:07:30.567
Oh, aye?

01:07:30.608 --> 01:07:32.067
Where the dissidents go or something.

01:07:32.108 --> 01:07:33.858
I dinn-y, I think that's where they go.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.233
It's no bad read.

01:07:35.275 --> 01:07:37.317
May as well be set in Whitfield, eh?

01:07:37.358 --> 01:07:38.442
How's that?

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:41.942
Well, it's that fucking grim, eh?

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.650
Where's the drum kit?

01:08:01.692 --> 01:08:02.608
Drum kit?

01:08:04.442 --> 01:08:07.108
Aye, you no with the Maiden?

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.858
Do I look like I'm
with the fuckin' Maiden?

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:11.942
I'm hear to fix the lavie.

01:08:11.983 --> 01:08:13.650
Vienna Boys Choir last night.

01:08:13.692 --> 01:08:15.775
Forty laddies, one lavie.

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:17.524
Torture.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.524
This was the point I realized

01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:28.817
we were fucked.

01:08:50.107 --> 01:08:53.107
I'll catch you later, Davie.

01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:58.692
Dinn-y look at me, I'm

01:08:58.732 --> 01:08:59.899

01:09:02.317 --> 01:09:04.274
Don't know where I can
find Davie McLean, do ya?

01:09:04.317 --> 01:09:05.482
I'm the man himself.

01:09:05.524 --> 01:09:06.692
Hey, Rod Smallwood.

01:09:06.732 --> 01:09:08.149

Pleasure's all mine.

01:09:09.482 --> 01:09:10.482
Decent drive up?

01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:13.317
Yeah, Drove up from
Sunderland at the crack of dawn.

01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:16.067
We had a show last night, crowd loved it.

01:09:16.107 --> 01:09:18.274
Late night then, my man.

01:09:20.692 --> 01:09:22.192

Thought a first class outfit like

01:09:29.067 --> 01:09:31.649

01:09:31.692 --> 01:09:32.857

01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:44.149

What's that when it's at home?

01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:49.024
Just sausage, but cut in a square.

01:09:51.232 --> 01:09:53.232
You've read the contract.

01:10:08.733 --> 01:10:09.900
Course.

01:10:09.942 --> 01:10:11.817
Even read the small print.

01:10:11.858 --> 01:10:14.400
Right, well, that's
the most important thing.

01:10:14.442 --> 01:10:16.775
Good news on the Ruddles.

01:10:16.817 --> 01:10:18.942

What is it?

01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:16.983
I may have overlooked a few things.

01:11:17.025 --> 01:11:18.400
I need you to look down
the back of the sofa,

01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:21.733
there should be letter that
says Cow Bell Agency on it.

01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:22.858
Hold on.

01:11:25.358 --> 01:11:26.692

01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:02.317
What the fuck are Ruddles?

01:12:19.025 --> 01:12:21.025
What's goin' on now?

01:12:23.067 --> 01:12:25.108
Hope you've not got
any plans for the day.

01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:26.775
How?

01:12:26.817 --> 01:12:28.900
We're in the catering business.

01:12:28.942 --> 01:12:29.817
The whole thing was a fucking

01:12:29.858 --> 01:12:31.358
shambles to be honest with ya.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.442
The thing is Davie, I just
don't have time for this.

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:37.067
We're a real band and people
are paying money for this.

01:12:37.108 --> 01:12:39.483
Maiden's manager, well,
he was fuckin ragin'.

01:12:39.525 --> 01:12:40.442
Could see his point, though.

01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:41.858
We didn't even have a crew.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.275
So right enough, I'm out on the streets

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.608
trying to find a bunch of
jakies to fill the positions.

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.983
All right lads, much on the day?

01:12:48.025 --> 01:12:50.067
To be honest, that was going fine until,

01:12:50.108 --> 01:12:54.775
Hang about, is that
our fucking guitar he's got?

01:12:58.942 --> 01:12:59.733
I mean, these
guys were literally off

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.858
the streets, so I dinnae
ken what we were expecting.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.442
Then, the second batch
of shit hit the fan.

01:13:10.233 --> 01:13:12.192
Oy, mate, who have
you got for opening act?

01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:13.400
Opening act?

01:13:14.442 --> 01:13:16.817
Look, fucking Christ, tell
me you got an opening act?

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:17.650
Don't worry about it.

01:13:17.692 --> 01:13:18.483
I know all the bands in Dundee.

01:13:18.525 --> 01:13:21.108
I'll just give one of them a phone.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:25.983
Back in the phone box, trying to find

01:13:26.025 --> 01:13:28.233
a last minute replacement.

01:13:28.275 --> 01:13:29.400
John's running about fucking daft,

01:13:29.442 --> 01:13:31.900
and my dad is in the kitchen
trying to cater for 40 people.

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.650
We had nay clue what
the fuck was going on.

01:13:34.692 --> 01:13:36.233
Just pulling switches, praying it would

01:13:36.275 --> 01:13:38.442
all come together in the end.

01:13:38.483 --> 01:13:41.025
And then, the band manager asks,

01:13:41.067 --> 01:13:44.650
Right, can I
get me 2K now, please?

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:51.275
♪ I feel sorry for you ♪

01:13:51.317 --> 01:13:52.150
John.

01:13:53.025 --> 01:13:53.942
How many tickets we sold?

01:13:54.817 --> 01:13:55.608
Not enough.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:58.525
Well, what we gonna do?

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.233
Take a wild guess.

01:14:01.275 --> 01:14:03.358
John, wait up a second.

01:14:35.442 --> 01:14:38.650
You're not going to say
goodbye before your big gig?

01:14:38.692 --> 01:14:40.108
Aye, of course.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.192
I'll see you there.

01:14:44.233 --> 01:14:46.608
I'm really proud of you, you know?

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.608
The shows, I mean.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.942
You know that right?

01:14:49.983 --> 01:14:51.150
Aye, course I ken that.

01:14:53.192 --> 01:14:54.442
You know, it's funny.

01:14:54.483 --> 01:14:55.567
You're not in a rush are ya, John?

01:14:55.608 --> 01:14:57.525
Go on, have a sit down.

01:14:58.358 --> 01:14:59.733
This will make you laugh.

01:15:01.567 --> 01:15:04.983
I heard a wee rumour from
the girls a wee while ago.

01:15:05.025 --> 01:15:06.025
Aye?

01:15:06.067 --> 01:15:08.275
That you had died.

01:15:14.067 --> 01:15:15.192
I've been meaning to ask you about that.

01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:17.733
What was that all about?

01:15:20.692 --> 01:15:22.108
Must have been someone else.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.150
Mmm.

01:15:23.192 --> 01:15:24.942
Lot of people called.

01:15:26.442 --> 01:15:29.608
I cried my eyes out actually.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.733
Then, you walked through
the door, quite the thing.

01:15:32.775 --> 01:15:33.733
I thought, ah, yeah, they must

01:15:33.775 --> 01:15:36.483
have been talking about somebody else.

01:15:36.525 --> 01:15:40.233
So I dried my eyes, and
popped my make up on.

01:15:40.275 --> 01:15:42.192
You never even noticed.

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:49.400
Right, well, I've gotta
go, I'll see you later, okay?

01:15:49.442 --> 01:15:51.192
Aye, with bells on.

01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:57.025
Just make sure you put it
back like the last time, eh?

01:15:57.442 --> 01:15:58.275
What?

01:16:01.733 --> 01:16:02.733
Good luck.

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:36.525
Dinnae worry.

01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:38.317
Shona dinnae see you.

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:42.983
Beautiful night.

01:16:45.483 --> 01:16:47.733
Maiden even gonna play?

01:16:47.775 --> 01:16:49.692
And that was the big question.

01:16:49.733 --> 01:16:52.733
After all the stress and all the debt,

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.775
would it all fall apart?

01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:45.900
Of course it didn't.

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:48.067
Otherwise why would I be
telling you this story?

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.317
Maiden.

01:18:13.233 --> 01:18:15.817
Maiden, Maiden, Maiden, Maiden.

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:19.775
It was unbelievable.

01:18:19.817 --> 01:18:22.067
Never in our wildest
dreams would we think fans

01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:24.150
by the bus load would come from Brechin,

01:18:24.192 --> 01:18:27.150
Arbroath, Perth, even as far as Crieff.

01:18:27.192 --> 01:18:28.775
Queues around the bloody block.

01:18:28.817 --> 01:18:30.900
Maybe my nonstop praying
at Father Vettriano's

01:18:30.942 --> 01:18:32.650
had something to do with it.

01:18:32.692 --> 01:18:35.858
Well, whatever the case
may be, they loved it.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.483
The rest, as they say, is history.

01:18:38.525 --> 01:18:40.525
And I can drink to that.

01:18:43.733 --> 01:18:44.567
Davie.

01:18:47.275 --> 01:18:50.983
For all your faults, that was
a decent show the other night.

01:18:51.025 --> 01:18:52.733
Make any money?

01:18:52.775 --> 01:18:54.233
After we paid back everything we owed,

01:18:54.275 --> 01:18:55.442
had a bit of a piss up to celebrate

01:18:55.483 --> 01:18:58.067
still being alive, but that was about it.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.067
Sure you didn't gamble it away?

01:19:00.108 --> 01:19:01.275
Nah, I'm done with that.

01:19:01.317 --> 01:19:02.317
Bet on it?

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:06.817
Sorry I couldn't hang
around after the show.

01:19:06.858 --> 01:19:09.358
College and all that,
you know what it's like.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.108
Actually, I dinnae.

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:12.525
I never went once,
they're about to can me.

01:19:12.567 --> 01:19:15.525
I know, it's pretty obvious.

01:19:15.567 --> 01:19:18.483
Right, well, what you up to?

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:20.025
Going to London.

01:19:20.858 --> 01:19:24.858
Yeah, got a placement at
Guys and St. Thomas, so.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.317
What you always wanted, eh?

01:19:27.358 --> 01:19:31.525
I'm sorry I was a completely
unreasonable prick to you.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:32.400
I just,

01:19:36.775 --> 01:19:37.608
Go on.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.150
I was falling in love with ya.

01:19:43.192 --> 01:19:44.275
Made me daft.

01:19:47.233 --> 01:19:49.400
The apology means a lot.

01:19:50.317 --> 01:19:51.192
It's funny, sometimes I can see

01:19:51.233 --> 01:19:53.733
the world in your eyes, Davie.

01:19:56.317 --> 01:19:57.150
Well,

01:19:58.192 --> 01:19:59.442
see you around.

01:20:00.483 --> 01:20:01.817
No, you won't.

01:20:05.108 --> 01:20:06.025
Course.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:06.900
Well,

01:20:08.192 --> 01:20:09.025
bye.

01:20:10.192 --> 01:20:11.692
You should come.

01:20:13.567 --> 01:20:14.358
What?

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.192
London.

01:20:15.233 --> 01:20:16.025
Whats keeping you here?

01:20:16.067 --> 01:20:17.317
Hearing that a lot just now.

01:20:17.358 --> 01:20:19.317
Well, it's true.

01:20:19.358 --> 01:20:20.192
Shona,

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:22.108
I would.

01:20:24.733 --> 01:20:27.608
But, bottom line, I'm totally skint.

01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:31.067
You can usually magic something up.

01:20:31.108 --> 01:20:34.025
If you change your mind, I'm
getting the train tomorrow.

01:20:34.067 --> 01:20:35.317
See you 'round.

01:20:38.483 --> 01:20:41.817
I realized just
how special Shona was.

01:20:41.858 --> 01:20:44.275
It was almost like she knew.

01:20:47.233 --> 01:20:49.900
Come on, son, you're
gonna miss your train.

01:20:49.942 --> 01:20:53.358
It's not leaving for another 90 minutes.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.733
Give us a break eh?

01:20:55.942 --> 01:20:57.900
I made you a couple of sandwiches, son.

01:20:57.942 --> 01:20:59.108
Ta, Mum.

01:20:59.150 --> 01:21:00.483
What's this?

01:21:00.525 --> 01:21:01.983
This is for you.

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.067
For me?

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.692
A wee present.

01:21:04.733 --> 01:21:06.858
Before I forget, this came for you.

01:21:14.733 --> 01:21:15.567
Jesus.

01:21:16.983 --> 01:21:20.233
Dinnae expect a reply from John Pilger.

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:22.150
Oh, I'm sorry son.

01:21:22.192 --> 01:21:24.567
Well, at least you tried.

01:21:24.608 --> 01:21:25.900
Dear David, thank you so much

01:21:25.942 --> 01:21:27.817
for your generous offer to come and work.

01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:34.525
Look forward to you
joining us in Phnom Phen.

01:21:34.567 --> 01:21:36.192
Yours sincerely, John Pilger.

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.483
Sure you want to go to London, son?

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:40.942
I'll have to have a
wee think about it, eh?

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.317
Well, this is different.

01:21:45.358 --> 01:21:46.858
You can take that
Constable painting down

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.150
and stick that up, instead.

01:21:49.192 --> 01:21:50.525
Have a wee look.

01:21:51.983 --> 01:21:54.817
Got it from Father Vettriano.

01:21:54.858 --> 01:21:56.942
It's by his nephew, Jack.

01:21:58.358 --> 01:22:00.608
Supposed to be pretty good.

01:22:02.525 --> 01:22:03.692
Thanks, son.

01:22:04.817 --> 01:22:05.983
That's lovely.

01:22:11.108 --> 01:22:15.192
Ah well, come on, we'd
better get a move on, son.

01:22:15.233 --> 01:22:16.650
I'll get my coat.

01:22:17.775 --> 01:22:21.275
Davie son, dinnae tell your dad.

01:22:21.317 --> 01:22:22.942
Here's 20 quid.

01:22:22.983 --> 01:22:25.192
You'll need it, London is dear.

01:22:25.233 --> 01:22:26.400
Thanks, Mum.

01:22:31.358 --> 01:22:33.483
But you should nay have.

01:22:33.525 --> 01:22:37.025
Right, son, chop chop, time we were off.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:52.858
Here you go son.

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.358
20 quid.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.317
Dinnae tell your mother.

01:22:56.358 --> 01:22:57.983
It's dear way down there.

01:22:58.025 --> 01:22:59.900
Especially with your habits.

01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:01.900
Cheers, Dad.

01:23:01.942 --> 01:23:04.025
I'll give it my best, eh?

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:09.317
I'm awfully proud of you, son

01:23:27.358 --> 01:23:30.525
Started to think you ditched me.

01:23:30.567 --> 01:23:32.400
Came to say goodbye.

01:23:33.692 --> 01:23:34.483
What?

01:23:34.525 --> 01:23:35.983
You need to leave more than I do.

01:23:36.025 --> 01:23:38.025
So, you're not coming?

01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:41.775
Cannae believe you lied to me.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:45.275
I bullshitted you, it's
completely different.

01:23:45.317 --> 01:23:47.483
Anyway, you slept with someone else.

01:23:52.567 --> 01:23:53.817
Who told you?

01:23:58.442 --> 01:23:59.692
You just did.

01:24:03.775 --> 01:24:06.775
Look, Davie, you'll be a big success.

01:24:06.817 --> 01:24:07.900
Doing what?

01:24:09.608 --> 01:24:11.275
Living your dream.

01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:44.692
Dessie wants to talk to you.

01:24:44.733 --> 01:24:48.775
Word on the pavey
is you're a useful young buck.

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:51.275
May have some work for you.

01:24:51.317 --> 01:24:54.358
Job for life, if you want it, son.

01:25:07.525 --> 01:25:09.650
Sitting here
now, going over all this,

01:25:09.692 --> 01:25:13.233
you cannae help but wonder, what if?

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:14.733
Then, you realize that it's just the cards

01:25:14.775 --> 01:25:16.900
that you're dealt by the
big man up the stairs.

01:25:16.942 --> 01:25:20.358
You can bluff, you can play percentages,

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.150
you can follow your
head, follow your heart.

01:25:23.192 --> 01:25:25.067
But at the end of the day,
