WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
Oh, this is amazing.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.096
I wish I had a playhouse
like this when I was a kid.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.749
Really? You never had
a playhouse?

00:10.793 --> 00:13.317
No. I mean, my dad did buy
the house next door

00:13.361 --> 00:16.146
for us to play in.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.496
I'm gonna hook up the garden
hose, so it has running water.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.758
Why does it need
running water?

00:19.802 --> 00:22.065
Same reason
it's got electricity:

00:22.109 --> 00:25.112
Bernadette and I both work,
and we're overcompensating.

00:26.504 --> 00:30.421
This reminds me of a traditional
Amish barn raising.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.467
With everyone pitching in.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.078
How exactly are you pitching in?

00:35.122 --> 00:37.298
I don't hear anyone else
giving facts

00:37.341 --> 00:39.169
about traditional
Amish barn raising.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.260
The rest of us are pitching in
with hammers and nails.

00:43.304 --> 00:46.350
Well, facts are my nails,
and my voice is the hammer

00:46.394 --> 00:49.223
which pounds them
through the wood of your skull.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.139
Well, that is how it feels.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.272
Hey, uh, can you
pass me that drill?

00:55.316 --> 00:57.100
Yeah, fun fact
about Amish barn raising--

00:57.144 --> 00:59.102
they don't use any power tools.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.496
Amy, make him stop.No.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.238
If he tires himself out now,
he'll sleep better tonight.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.849
BERNADETTE: Hey, Howie,
can you give me a hand?

01:06.892 --> 01:08.024
I need to get some work done,

01:08.068 --> 01:09.460
and the kids are climbing
all over me.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.462
You know what?
I'll watch them.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.508
You sure?But I was just
about to tell everyone

01:13.551 --> 01:14.944
why they're called
Pennsylvania Dutch

01:14.987 --> 01:16.728
when they really hail
from Germany.

01:17.773 --> 01:18.991
Yep.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.906
Thanks.

01:20.950 --> 01:24.388
So, what do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

01:24.432 --> 01:25.955
And when our kids outgrow it,

01:25.998 --> 01:27.739
we can Airbnb it
to other people's babies.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.221
Funny.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.483
You all right?

01:32.527 --> 01:34.311
Sorry, I haven't had
a second to myself.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.705
So let me just go back
inside, finish my report,

01:36.748 --> 01:39.142
brush my teeth, change
out of my pajamas,
make a sandwich,

01:39.186 --> 01:41.840
and then I'll come out here
and laugh at your joke.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.930
Ooh. As long as you're
making sandwiches...

01:46.541 --> 01:49.109
You can laugh
at that one later, too.

01:50.458 --> 01:53.287
All right, I've kept you
in suspense long enough.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.637
"Dutch" is a bastardization
of the word "Deutsch,"

01:55.680 --> 01:57.117
meaning German.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.642
What's German for "annoying"?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.731
Nervig.Why do you ask?

02:04.428 --> 02:07.910

02:07.953 --> 02:11.261

02:32.500 --> 02:34.806
[knocks]President Siebert,
you wanted to see me?

02:34.850 --> 02:36.895
Hey. There's my guy!

02:37.940 --> 02:39.507
You sound like my wife

02:39.550 --> 02:42.336
just before she asked me
to go to Coachella.

02:42.379 --> 02:45.252
No, this is gonna be
way more fun than Coachella.

02:45.295 --> 02:48.429
More fun than heatstroke?
Good luck.

02:48.472 --> 02:51.562
So, there are some funds left

02:51.606 --> 02:53.173
in the general
administrative grant,

02:53.216 --> 02:55.958
and I need somebody to decide
how we should disburse them.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.351
Really?

02:57.394 --> 02:59.483
W-Wow, what an honor.
Thank you.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.007
So how do I decide
who gets the money?

03:02.051 --> 03:03.661
How do you decide anything?

03:03.705 --> 03:07.230
Think about it with your brain,
and then say it with your mouth.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.624
Yeah, right, sure.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.626
Uh, so, after I decide,

03:11.669 --> 03:14.194
do I then submit it to you
for approval, or...?

03:14.237 --> 03:15.586
No. You decide,
you approve,

03:15.630 --> 03:17.849
and then you pride yourself
on a job well done.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.242
That's a lot of responsibility.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.462
Well, if I didn't think
you were up to the task,

03:21.505 --> 03:23.246
you wouldn't have been fifth
on my list.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.251
Thank you.
I-I'll get started right away.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.253
And I look forward
to hearing nothing about it.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.821
I will keep you posted.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.173
Hey, thank you guys again

03:37.217 --> 03:39.001
for helping out
yesterday.No problem.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.003
That was really fun.It wasfun.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.831
But I am sore.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.180
You didn't lift a finger.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
No, but I narrated
the entire event,

03:46.269 --> 03:49.185
and I am paying for it today.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.492
Gentlemen.Hey.
Hi.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.189
Leonard, do I detect

03:53.233 --> 03:54.712
a little swagger in your step?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.192
Mm, possibly.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.280
Well, stop.
It doesn't suit you.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.501
What's going on?Well,

04:00.544 --> 04:03.112
Siebert put me in charge
of handing out the last bit

04:03.155 --> 04:05.375
of the administrative funds,
and I have sole discretion.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.987
Ooh! Looks like
Christmas came early.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.859
First thing on my list
is a golden umbrella,

04:10.902 --> 04:13.165
'cause Leonard's
gonna make it rain!

04:13.209 --> 04:16.517
Uh, hold on, I'm not
just gonna hand out money.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.606
There's a procedure
you need to follow.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.911
I believe he's referring

04:19.955 --> 04:22.000
to the traditional
"kissing of the buttocks."

04:22.044 --> 04:23.306
Should we form a line,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.961
or just do it like
we're bobbing for apples?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.179
LEONARD:
Cute,

04:27.223 --> 04:29.225
but President Siebert
trusted me with this,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.618
and I'm taking it seriously.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.054
If you have a
legitimate request,

04:32.097 --> 04:33.925
you can submit it
to me in writing,

04:33.969 --> 04:35.536
and I'll evaluate it
based on its merits.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.626
Sure, sure. Is "Jet Ski"
one word or two?

04:38.669 --> 04:41.368
Hofstadter!

04:41.411 --> 04:44.632
Heard Siebert put you in charge
of the administrative fund.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.025
Can't think
of a better guy for the job.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.897
I think he's done this before.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.769
Leonard,
I know you and I have a...

04:51.813 --> 04:55.295
oh, troubled history, but I hope
that when I make my request

04:55.338 --> 04:57.079
you'll give me a fair shot.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.385
Of course.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.039
See? That's why I like
about this guy: integrity.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.302
Bring it in!

05:04.129 --> 05:06.697
I just put something
in your pocket.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.961
It's good at all
El Pollo Locos.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.750
[Neil crying]

05:15.793 --> 05:19.754
WOLOWITZ: Halley, leave your
brother's dirty diaper alone.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.278
Put that down.
That is not a hat.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.150
That is not
a hat! Oh!

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
[crying continues]

05:27.196 --> 05:29.633
Okay. Everybody
in the sink.Oh.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.854
Bad news, Howie.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.204
I'm gonna be stuck at work
for a while.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.210
Oh, that's terrible.
Hang in there.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.865
I'll be home as soon as I can.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.956
[sighs]:
Ah...

05:48.957 --> 05:51.786
He deserves better.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.267
No, I'm notgoing
to reconsider.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.661
Your request was denied.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.663
I don't care
if it helps you think;

05:59.707 --> 06:02.536
you don't need a koi pond
in your office.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.365
Well, you should
have thought about that

06:05.408 --> 06:07.628
beforeyou bought the koi!

06:07.671 --> 06:09.194
Wow. That was
a little rough.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.935
Well, I have to be.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.242
Everyone assumes I'm just gonna
give them whatever they want.

06:13.285 --> 06:17.377
Hmm. But you're not, are you?

06:17.420 --> 06:18.421
No, I'm not.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.554
I mean, look at this.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.687
An espresso machine?
I don't think so. Denied!

06:24.949 --> 06:27.517
Wow, I really like
this side of you.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.562
Really?

06:28.605 --> 06:31.434
Yeah, just so decisive.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.480
Well, check this out.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.569
A standing desk. Denied!

06:35.612 --> 06:37.266
Oh!

06:41.444 --> 06:43.925
If you want to stand,
do it on your own time,
'cause I'm the boss.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.579
Yeah, you are.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.277
Hello.
Hey.
Hey.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.149
Leonard, I just wanted
to congratulate you on how well

06:51.193 --> 06:52.847
you are managing
this grant money.What do you want?

06:52.890 --> 06:55.806
Nothing. I just came by
to pay you a compliment.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.025
Nice try.
The answer's no.

06:57.068 --> 07:00.071
To what? I'm not
asking you for anything.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.509
All I need for my job
is right here. Hmm?

07:02.552 --> 07:05.120
This is my office.
Which makes for a great commute.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.035
Home, work, home.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.690
I'm still working--
I'm just working from home.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.606
You know, if it's that easy,
then why does Leonard

07:12.649 --> 07:14.172
have to drive you
to work every day?

07:14.216 --> 07:16.523
Because I like the frozen yogurt
machine in the cafeteria.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.090
Ooh, I suppose I could use
a frozen yogurt machine...

07:19.134 --> 07:21.223
Denied!

07:24.052 --> 07:27.011
Oh, you should have seen him--
denying things left and right.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.579
It was so sexy.

07:31.189 --> 07:34.236
'Course, I made a request
he did notdeny.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.499
Uh-huh.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.370
Are you listening to me?

07:38.414 --> 07:40.547
Yeah, sure.
You slept with your husband.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.333
What is going
on with you?

07:44.376 --> 07:46.117
It's not a big thing.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.164
Have you ever told Leonard
a little white lie?

07:49.207 --> 07:51.906
Mm. Well, he
thinks I've seen

07:51.949 --> 07:53.516
every one of the
Star Warsmovies,

07:53.560 --> 07:57.128
but I've really only seen
the one with the gold robot.

08:00.436 --> 08:03.178
That could be any of them.Exactly.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.225
I've been telling Howie
that I've had to work late

08:07.269 --> 08:08.662
the past couple nights,
but really,

08:08.705 --> 08:11.447
I've just been hiding out
in Howie's playhouse.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.101
Does that make me awful?

08:13.144 --> 08:14.450
Awful? No.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.279
Uh, strange? Yes.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.847
Sad? A little, yes.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.980
It's just that work's
been crazy, and the minute
I get home, I have two kids

08:23.024 --> 08:24.416
hanging on me,
and sometimes I don't want

08:24.460 --> 08:26.723
babies pulling my hair
and pinching my belly fat.

08:26.767 --> 08:31.162
That'd be a good slogan
for a condom company.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.688
I love my kids,
but that hour to myself

08:34.731 --> 08:37.778
just makes me feel human again.

08:37.821 --> 08:41.085
So, you go home
and sit alone in a toy house

08:41.129 --> 08:42.522
in the backyard?

08:43.958 --> 08:46.221
Yeah!

08:48.484 --> 08:51.574
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
did you have a chance

08:51.618 --> 08:53.750
to look over my proposal?I did,

08:53.794 --> 08:55.491
and your research
is fascinating.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.885
I had no idea that crows
were that smart.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.364
Do they really hold grudges?

08:59.408 --> 09:01.105
They do. One
of them escaped

09:01.149 --> 09:03.064
from my behavioral
study a year ago.

09:03.107 --> 09:07.198
I can't prove it's him,
but something craps
on my car every day.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.680
Well, l-look,
I only have enough money

09:10.724 --> 09:12.421
to fund one request,
but your project

09:12.464 --> 09:14.075
is definitely
in the running.

09:14.118 --> 09:17.208
Okay, but, uh, when do you think
you might make a decision?

09:17.252 --> 09:19.036
Because I have
to upgrade their cages

09:19.080 --> 09:21.648
before they learn
how to open the locks.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.041
When I came in to my lab
this morning,

09:24.085 --> 09:26.087
they suddenly got silent.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.265
I think they're
planning something.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.225
Um, soon. I've narrowed it
down to three projects.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.879
Ooh, is mine one
of them?

09:35.923 --> 09:37.054
Actually, yeah.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.665
The software in
the telescope room

09:38.708 --> 09:39.927
hasn't been
upgraded in years,

09:39.970 --> 09:41.842
and it seems like
it might be time.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[chuckles]

09:43.887 --> 09:46.150
So you're just gonna give
the money to your friend?

09:46.194 --> 09:47.238
I smell a rat.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.239
I work with rats, too.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.154
That might be me.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.244
I'm not just giving it
to my friend, Barry.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.116
Your proposal is
also in the mix.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.161
Wait, so those
are the three?

09:57.205 --> 09:58.641
You're not
even considering mine?

09:58.685 --> 10:01.165
Why, because they're PhDs
and I'm just an engineer?

10:01.209 --> 10:03.428
No, because they wrote
detailed proposals,

10:03.472 --> 10:06.170
and you sent a YouTube clip
of the guy from Jerry Maguire

10:06.214 --> 10:08.303
saying, "Show me
the money!"

10:09.739 --> 10:10.827
KRIPKE:
All right, Hofstadter,

10:10.871 --> 10:11.828
what's it gonna be?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.134
Which project
are you gonna pick?

10:13.177 --> 10:14.352
Yeah, come on, Leonard.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.093
Tell us now.LEE: But, remember,

10:16.137 --> 10:19.967
crows aren't the only ones
who can hold a grudge.

10:20.010 --> 10:23.971
Look, all three of your
proposals have a lot of merit.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.190
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.452
I can tell you're stressed.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.933
If it helps,
I withdraw my proposal.

10:29.977 --> 10:30.847
It doesn't help.

10:30.891 --> 10:31.543
Fine. Then I'm back in the mix.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.502
Show me the money!

10:35.243 --> 10:36.853
Okay, I-I just--

10:36.897 --> 10:39.639
I need everyone
to back off.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.511
I'm in charge here, and I'll
decide when I'm ready to decide.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.469
When will that be?[groans]

10:44.513 --> 10:45.862
A day, a week.
I don't know!

10:45.906 --> 10:48.256
Where are you going?I don't know that either!

10:58.745 --> 11:00.572
Ooh.

11:00.616 --> 11:03.619
Someone's
making decisions.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.404
I'm reviewing these proposals.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.884
Yeah. 'Cause you're
the boss man,

11:07.928 --> 11:09.016
telling people what's what.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.409
I like it.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.889
[whining]:
It's just so hard!

11:12.933 --> 11:15.544
All-all three of these
proposals have merit.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.024
How do I choose?

11:17.067 --> 11:20.288
Well, not with that voice.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.291
There has got to be
a right decision

11:23.334 --> 11:24.727
based on empirical evidence.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.729
Look, I made pros
and cons lists,

11:26.773 --> 11:29.079
and then I came up with
three different scoring systems

11:29.123 --> 11:30.472
to determine
the best project.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.561
I just don't know
what scoring system to use.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.694
So I'm working on
a meta-scoring system

11:34.737 --> 11:35.825
to score the scoring systems,

11:35.869 --> 11:37.348
but the math is
really complicated.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.654
You want me
to walk you through it?

11:41.135 --> 11:44.529
Cheers.Cheers.

11:46.314 --> 11:49.012
[sighs]

11:49.056 --> 11:50.884
Turn that off.
Are you trying to get us caught?

11:50.927 --> 11:51.928
Oh.

11:54.539 --> 11:58.065
So, I've narrowed it down
to three worthwhile projects,

11:58.108 --> 11:59.980
but I only have the money
to fund one of them.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.417
Lucky for you,
I have a solution.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.115
I can't wait.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.988
You free up more money
and I fund all of them.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.990
Mm, no.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.689
Or-- hear me out--

12:13.733 --> 12:15.560
yes.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.607
That way, e-everybody's happy.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.782
You can't make everybody happy.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.088
I think I can.You can't.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.394
Well, actually...You're making me unhappy.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.180
Okay, what would you do?

12:26.223 --> 12:28.791
I'd find some sap
and put him in charge

12:28.835 --> 12:31.446
so I wouldn't have
to be the bad guy.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.798
That's a really good id-- Oh.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.936
[gasps]

12:44.502 --> 12:46.113
Whatcha doin'?

12:46.156 --> 12:47.810
You scared me.
[chuckles]

12:47.854 --> 12:49.072
I'll ask again.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.118
What-cha doin'?

12:51.161 --> 12:53.468
Nothing.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.904
Really?

12:54.948 --> 12:57.124
You and Bernadette
aren't doing stuff without me?

12:57.167 --> 12:59.691
What? No!
Why would you even say that?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.606
You know how your talent

13:01.650 --> 13:03.913
is getting just drunk enough
to have a good time

13:03.957 --> 13:06.133
without being hungover
the next day?

13:06.176 --> 13:09.310
Thank you.
[chuckles]

13:09.353 --> 13:12.966
Well, mine is knowing
when I'm being excluded.

13:13.009 --> 13:14.881
So spill.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.883
I'm-I'm just running
some errands.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.102
Yeah?

13:19.146 --> 13:21.539
With a bag full of wine?I...

13:21.583 --> 13:24.281
Got to stay hydrated.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.370
Try again.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.458
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.938
We did not mean
to leave you out.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.288
All right? Bernadette has
been feeling fried at home,

13:31.332 --> 13:34.335
so we ended up hanging out
in Halley's playhouse.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.990
Like a secret club?

13:37.033 --> 13:39.862
No! Just, like, a
place to spend time

13:39.906 --> 13:42.082
that we don't tell
anyone else about.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.175
And what would be
a shorter way of saying that?

13:49.219 --> 13:52.527
[quietly]:
Secret club.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.746
Well, you really hurt
my feelings.[sighs]

13:54.790 --> 13:56.661
What can I do to
make it up to you?

13:56.705 --> 13:57.837
I'm in a secret club!

13:57.880 --> 14:00.013
Shh!

14:00.056 --> 14:02.798
Is there some sort
of humiliating initiation?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.061
'Cause I would literally do
anything.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.244
Leonard, you've
been losing to me

14:14.288 --> 14:16.768
in three-dimensional chess
for many years.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.683
You know
what would be neat?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.990
If this was some sort
of long con

14:21.034 --> 14:23.253
and one day you say,
"Let's make this interesting,"

14:23.297 --> 14:24.994
put money on it, and reveal

14:25.038 --> 14:27.692
that you actually know
what you're doing.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.089
A very long con indeed.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.395
Checkmate.[groans]

14:36.136 --> 14:37.833
Sorry. I'm distracted.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.053
Ooh, aren't you the hustler.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.664
No matter
who I give the funds to,

14:42.707 --> 14:44.666
someone is gonna be upset
with me.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.320
Do you really care
if people are angry at you?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.191
Of course.Interesting.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.194
Why don't you go to the store
and get me some tapioca pudding

14:51.238 --> 14:53.936
or I'm gonna be angry at you.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.546
No.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.592
So it comes and goes?

14:57.635 --> 15:00.943
How do you not care what
people think of you?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.075
It's easy.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.424
I mean, not "beating you
at chess" easy,

15:03.467 --> 15:05.643
but what is?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.037
Wait,

15:08.081 --> 15:10.039
you can make this decision.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.085
You don't care if
you upset people.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.390
You can pick for me.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.522
I certainly could.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.089
Oh, great.But I won't.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.569
I think this is
a learning opportunity for you.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.093
Sheldon, come on.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.746
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I upset you?

15:21.790 --> 15:24.227
Yes.Ask me how I feel about that.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.015
So where does Leonard
think you are?

15:29.058 --> 15:30.712
Oh, I told him
I was at yoga.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.715
[chuckles] Well,
you are stretching the truth.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.673
Yeah. Where does
Sheldon think youare?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.980
Oh, Sheldon's
kind of like a dog--

15:38.024 --> 15:39.764
he doesn't really think about me
when I'm gone,

15:39.808 --> 15:42.071
but he's so happy
when I show up.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.421
[oven dings]Ooh.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.249
Who wants
an Easy-Bake quesadilla?

15:46.293 --> 15:47.990
Me!

15:48.034 --> 15:48.991
Ooh, hot.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.471
[door closes]Shh.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.168
KOOTHRAPPALI: Thanks for
letting me come over and hang.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.823
So Leonard still hasn't
made a decision yet?No.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.477
And I've really been
laying on the guilt.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.348
Did you break out the sad eyes?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.481
You mean these bad boys?

16:03.092 --> 16:04.615
[whispering]:
What do we do?

16:04.659 --> 16:06.487
We're just gonna have to wait
till they go back inside.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.098
Okay, okay. Can
we very quietly

16:09.142 --> 16:10.882
open that second bottle of...

16:10.926 --> 16:12.449
[oven dings]

16:12.493 --> 16:14.669
[quietly]: Hey,
don't freak out,

16:14.712 --> 16:18.064
but I think there's
someone in your playhouse.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.588
Oh. Yeah,
that's just Bernadette.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.201
She's been hiding out
in there all week. [chuckles]

16:25.245 --> 16:27.073
Really? Why?

16:27.116 --> 16:29.162
[exhales]
I don't know.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.033
She's been
a little overwhelmed at work.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.775
And, frankly,
me and the kids are a lot.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.343
She just... [chuckles]
needs some downtime.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.258
And you just pretend
like you don't know?

16:38.301 --> 16:41.826
Sure. That's
how marriage works.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.132
Three years ago...
[chuckles]

16:43.176 --> 16:45.482
I told her I got life insurance,

16:45.526 --> 16:47.223
and I totally didn't.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.529
[laughs]

16:48.572 --> 16:51.271
Someday, she's gonna find out.
I'm gonna say,

16:51.314 --> 16:54.970
"Ha-ha! I know you've been
hiding in the playhouse."

16:55.014 --> 16:57.364
Why don't you just get
the life insurance?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.193
Whose side are you on?

17:01.498 --> 17:04.023
Can you hear
what they're saying?

17:04.066 --> 17:05.067
Shh, I'm trying.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.068
[cork pops]

17:06.112 --> 17:07.722
Huh.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.855
Sounds like Penny's
in there, too.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.295
Seriously, Leonard,
you didn't pick my project?

17:15.338 --> 17:16.296
I'm sorry, Raj.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.298
Did you go
with Crow Lady?No.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.821
You gave the money to Kripke?

17:19.864 --> 17:20.691
I did not.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.258
Wait, I'm confused.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.173
I thought there were only
three projects in contention.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.175
There were.
But, at the last minute,

17:26.219 --> 17:27.872
someone submitted an application

17:27.916 --> 17:30.223
for a pretty cool
europium-doped laser,

17:30.266 --> 17:32.312
and they made
a very compelling case.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.270
What was the case?

17:34.314 --> 17:37.926
Oh, that it was me
and I wanted it.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.101
You-you can't do that.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.668
You can't just fund
your own project.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.279
Uh, it turns out I can,
and I did.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.716
Interesting.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.544
What about not wanting
everybody to be mad at you?

17:47.588 --> 17:49.720
Well, I realized that,
no matter what decision I made,

17:49.764 --> 17:51.070
people were gonna be mad at me.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.637
And this way, I get a laser.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.640
That is the most selfish thing
you've ever done.

17:56.684 --> 17:57.946
I'm proud of you.

17:59.556 --> 18:00.905
And I don't care.Yes, you do.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.385
Yeah, I do.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.568
The europium laser
is so cool.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.570
It has a four-level
f-f transition

18:13.614 --> 18:15.485
which provides for
high power output,

18:15.529 --> 18:18.358
and its quantum efficiency
is off the charts.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.533
What are you going
to use it for?

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
I have no idea.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.844
Leonard,

18:26.888 --> 18:29.499
there's a crow
on your roof.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.674
I see it.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.590
Is that one
of Dr. Lee's crows?

18:33.634 --> 18:36.593
[caws]It has a tag on its leg.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.639
[cawing]

18:40.293 --> 18:42.556
Don't make
any sudden moves.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.558
Smart. Let's stand
perfectly still and...

18:44.601 --> 18:46.603
He's the one
you want!

18:48.039 --> 18:49.389
