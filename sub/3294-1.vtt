00:32.732 --> 00:34.825
Give our friend a chair.

00:36.769 --> 00:41.536
Frank, I need you
to do what he says.

00:42.608 --> 00:44.769
Now, listen fellas,
I've got a problem.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.806
You know, I like this guy.
I really do.

00:49.131 --> 00:51.131
But I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.910
My merchandise has gone missing.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.556
And when I lose my merchandise,
to make me feel better,

00:58.691 --> 01:00.159
I have to kill somebody.

01:01.084 --> 01:02.459
Wh- Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa!

01:03.060 --> 01:06.921
Longevity. Not a word synonymous
with the cocaine trade.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.635
I mean, look what happened
to Pablo Escobar.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.831
Things weren't really supposed
to turn out this way.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.789
I moved to the City of Angels
to follow a dream.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.752
Like anything else, there is a twist.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.643
I was following the
dreams of others.

01:36.669 --> 01:40.458
The party-goers, the would-be actors,
the directors, executives...

01:40.633 --> 01:45.026
the pariah and the hopeful, all hoping to
raise their position in the food chain.

01:46.572 --> 01:49.598
Most of them didn't even know the
rules of the game they were playing.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.199
So, here comes the Sandman, with
his wonderful bag of tricks.

02:20.606 --> 02:21.766
The dream smuggler,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.799
the only one who can make things happen.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.148
At first, I bought a strip joint,
made it cool and very private.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.678
See, the more hidden it was,
the more people lined up at the door.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.587
But then came the drugs, a great
trade with plenty of opportunities.

02:38.758 --> 02:42.785
Self employed, tax-free,
you turn into your own island.

02:43.629 --> 02:47.588
A fiscal paradise surrounded by
white sand and beautiful girls.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.694
Still, it wasn't enough.

02:50.803 --> 02:54.762
I needed to anchor myself to reality,
to not become like those zombies

02:54.774 --> 02:58.733
who crawl out at night hoping to
get cast in the next "big thing."

03:02.748 --> 03:07.708
So, I found myself a sweetheart,
the drug-free girl next door,

03:07.787 --> 03:11.621
still living with their parents,
and studying hard at college.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.594
Hot in bed, but without
that whole edge of despair.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.257
The only one where "the L word"
would actually spell love.

03:20.282 --> 03:22.282
Call her my dream
or my anchor,

03:22.802 --> 03:25.669
call her the sweet
temptation of reality.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.729
I call her Ashley.

03:27.840 --> 03:34.575
And for us to have any kind of future, I had to make
sure that Eddie and I could step up our operation.

03:50.596 --> 03:53.223
All right son, what
have you got for me?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.638
What the fuck is this?
Where's my money?

04:09.615 --> 04:11.976
That's it. That's everything.

04:12.618 --> 04:16.553
No, that's nowhere near everything.
Where's my money?

04:16.689 --> 04:18.656
That's it.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.659
That's it?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.662
One minute...

04:24.564 --> 04:26.691
Ah, the girlfriend.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.831
Hello sweetheart! Yes.

04:31.671 --> 04:36.132
Dinner tonight, for two?
Yes, of course, I'd love to.

04:36.241 --> 04:38.209
Ok, love you too. Bye.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.775
Sorry about that, where was I?
Ah, that's right...

04:43.749 --> 04:45.740
Where is my money?

04:46.586 --> 04:48.645
That's it, man. I swear!

04:48.854 --> 04:51.855
You fuckin' wee runt!
You runt!

04:52.625 --> 04:53.795
Where is it?

04:54.021 --> 04:56.244
That's it, man, it's
all watered down, man.

04:56.328 --> 04:57.996
I can't move it!

04:59.898 --> 05:03.298
You guys used to have the shit, man.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.066
I can't push it.

05:06.092 --> 05:08.588
You- you gotta tell Frank.

05:08.674 --> 05:13.543
Don't you tell anything to Frank! I don't want
him hearing anything of this, you understand?

05:15.615 --> 05:17.810
I gotta tell Frank, man.
He's my boy.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.120
I'm looking out for business, man.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.656
You're lookin' out for b- you're
lookin' out for business! Isn't ya?

05:25.057 --> 05:27.917
You're not fuckin' lookin'
out for business!

05:28.594 --> 05:32.724
I will kill you permanently! Do you got that?
You get me my money!

05:32.832 --> 05:36.700
- Now! Yes? Good boy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

05:36.802 --> 05:39.532
Now... fuck off!

05:50.349 --> 05:53.917
- You ever gonna get tired of holdin' his cock?
- What the fuck you talkin' about?

05:54.019 --> 05:55.987
You... and Madsen.

05:56.421 --> 06:02.617
Every time he wants to take a piss, he just calls you
up, you run over and you hold his tiny little cock.

06:03.662 --> 06:06.023
He's fuckin' you, mate,
and you know it.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.632
Fuck you, Eddie.

06:07.733 --> 06:10.702
- All right...
- No, no, fuck YOU.

06:12.137 --> 06:14.972
'Cause he's fuckin' you right up the arse!

06:15.074 --> 06:19.002
- And... he's laughin' all the way to the bank.
- Get the fuck out of here.

06:19.078 --> 06:22.447
- All right, all right, take it easy.
- No, no, no, this dude's disrespectin' me.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.473
Yeah, 'cause he's telling the truth, Tony.

06:25.417 --> 06:29.148
Look, there's an opportunity for us
to make a hell of a lot more money.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.748
Talk to Madsen,
see if he'll let us

06:32.825 --> 06:35.926
- run more weight on consignment.
- He's not gonna do that.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.354
Yes, he will! He listens to you.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.391
Look, you don't think
we can sell this shit?

06:41.767 --> 06:43.319
We cut you in on
the street level,

06:43.345 --> 06:46.895
then that's a hell of a lot more in your
pocket than Madsen's ever gonna give you.

06:47.706 --> 06:49.674
- And you know that.
- I don't know.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.378
He ain't got the minerals, son.
He ain't got the minerals!

06:53.379 --> 06:55.347
All right, all right,
Eddie, we get it.

06:59.184 --> 07:01.345
Come on, Tony,
what do you say?

07:01.453 --> 07:03.186
I'll talk to him.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.357
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.761
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I said I'd talk to him, didn't I?

07:09.928 --> 07:11.496
Atta boy!

07:11.864 --> 07:13.555
Scottish prick.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.429
- You think he's gonna talk to him?
- No.

07:45.264 --> 07:49.461
Frank, I told you 6 o'clock, you know
how my family is with punctuality.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.703
- I know, I know, I know.
- What happened?

07:51.870 --> 07:56.200
The traffic, it's just, uh... I'm sorry.

07:57.009 --> 08:00.035
It's okay, I'm happy you're here.
Come on, let's go.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.535
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, wait, what's the deal?

08:02.761 --> 08:06.873
Are they just sitting there
waiting for me to eat?

08:07.953 --> 08:10.081
Yeah, they are.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.193
- Whoo... okay...
- Are you nervous?

08:15.060 --> 08:17.961
- What? No! No. No.
- You're nervous.

08:18.097 --> 08:23.057
- Yeah, I'm nervous.
- Oh, babe, come on. It's gonna be fine. Let's go.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.928
Don't worry about it, please.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.606
Everybody, this is Frank.

08:37.850 --> 08:42.809
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.983
- Have a seat.
- Yeah.

08:46.925 --> 08:50.122
This is me.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.633
Thank you.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.970
This looks great.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.915
- Madsen! What's up?
- Oh, hey man! What's goin' on?

09:12.985 --> 09:14.953
How you doin', man?
Good?

09:15.053 --> 09:17.021
- Ah, good stuff here.
- Look at this!

09:17.089 --> 09:19.114
- How's it look?
- That's what I'm talking about, man.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.461
- You guys been drinkin'? Huh?
- Yeah.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.963
I'm gonna grab one too,
you need anything?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.098
Yeah, why not?

09:56.028 --> 09:58.929
I gotta say, I really appreciate
you bringing me on this case, sir.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.464
I mean, workin' with you is something
we all talked about at the Academy.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.493
- Oh yeah?
- Absolutely!

10:03.718 --> 10:05.718
The stuff you did with the
Mexican cartels is legend.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.872
- Over 40 indictments?
- 48... but who's counting?

10:12.478 --> 10:15.308
So I hear the local PD is all
over this case already.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.333
Should we clear out the
scene before they taint it?

10:17.883 --> 10:20.044
No, there's no need to
ruffle any feathers.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.251
No sign of forced entry.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.964
It was definitely somebody they knew.

10:39.037 --> 10:41.435
Minor struggle.

10:43.875 --> 10:48.301
Two bodies. Time of death: 6, 6:30 a.m.

10:50.048 --> 10:52.741
- This your first double homicide?
- Yeah.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.889
- You okay with blood?
- Yeah.

10:55.914 --> 10:58.614
Well, if you can hold your breakfast
down, I'll buy you a burger later.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.016
Rare.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.766
Who killed you, Madsen?

11:12.391 --> 11:14.391
Maxwell... DEA.

11:25.627 --> 11:26.827
Oh...

11:27.153 --> 11:30.981
As much money as these guys make, you'd think
they could splurge for some decent coffee.

11:31.089 --> 11:34.957
- Maxwell, DEA. You're the first on the scene here?
- Yeah.

11:35.093 --> 11:38.995
- What makes you think these guys had money?
- The Rolex watches they're wearin'?

11:39.097 --> 11:42.032
- Anything else?
- Well, there's no furniture in the place.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.630
We got two bodies, drugs everywhere,

11:44.636 --> 11:46.661
no witnesses,
nobody knows who they are.

11:47.072 --> 11:51.941
- Any theories?
- Well it sure as hell wasn't domestic violence.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.635
A deal gone bad.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.230
Oh... you guys are sharp.

11:56.356 --> 11:59.535
Well detective, thanks for your
work, we're gonna take it from here.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.796
So you expect me to walk
away from a double homicide?

12:01.822 --> 12:04.938
It's a double homicide and an
ongoing Federal investigation.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.618
You're gonna have to.

12:08.093 --> 12:11.062
If anything surfaces that may be
beneficial to the investigation,

12:11.163 --> 12:14.155
please call. Other than that,
stay out of our way.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.227
- Did you just get your driver's permit?
- Haraday, let's go.

12:17.936 --> 12:20.063
Put the card back in your diaper, kid.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.788
Ongoing?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.984
What the fuck?

12:34.019 --> 12:35.987
Hey.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.957
Hey!

13:44.956 --> 13:47.857
Come here, you fucker!

13:48.994 --> 13:51.087
- Why'd you kill Madsen?
- I didn't!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.556
- Bullshit.
- I was there for a score.

13:54.065 --> 13:55.899
- Who killed 'em?
- I don't know.

13:55.924 --> 13:57.924
Everyone was dead when I walked in,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.563
and then you pulled up so I hid.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.042
You all right?

14:16.988 --> 14:19.115
What's the hell happened?

14:19.991 --> 14:22.576
We got into a little wrestling
match, he got my backup.

14:22.702 --> 14:25.452
He tried to shoot me with
it, I put two in his chest.

14:27.232 --> 14:28.801
I heard four shots.

14:28.927 --> 14:30.923
Yeah, well, I was never
fuckin' good at math.

14:34.072 --> 14:35.589
I want a report.

14:36.015 --> 14:39.691
This is your Federal investigation,
you do the fuckin' report.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.043
- Freeze! Police!
- Jesus!

15:50.268 --> 15:52.268
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus! It's me.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.277
Franky... Jesus!

15:55.421 --> 15:59.423
You stupid wanker.
I could've shot you, mate.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.984
You didn't hear me yell "Police"?

16:01.493 --> 16:04.757
- So fuckin' what?
- So fuckin' what? Are you gonna shoot a cop?

16:05.264 --> 16:07.859
You can't shoot a cop, man.
What are you, nuts?

16:08.267 --> 16:10.258
Come on.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.268
- You're cray-cray.
- I'll give you this, Frank,

16:15.293 --> 16:17.275
your fuckin' timing's impeccable.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.244
- Open it.
- What is it?

16:19.711 --> 16:21.744
Just open it.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.220
Holy fuck!

16:29.321 --> 16:33.885
He actually went for it?
Mate, I cannot believe this.

16:34.293 --> 16:39.924
- That fat fuck never does consignment.
- Christmas came early...

16:40.399 --> 16:42.859
How much does he want?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.372
- Can I have this?
- Uh-huh.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.436
Frank.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.270
How much of a cut does he want?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.729
Um...

17:03.355 --> 17:05.346
I killed him.

17:05.523 --> 17:09.193
What?! Did you just say you killed him?

17:09.895 --> 17:14.655
God, Eddie, you know... you just
really shouldn't wear fur, man,

17:14.700 --> 17:16.667
I mean, that's just...
that's just cruel.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.394
I like fur.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.565
- It's really hot.
- Yeah. Fuck them rabbits.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.768
- Give me the remote control.
- No, I'm watchin' cartoons.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.378
Give me the remote control!

17:28.380 --> 17:31.872
- Jesus, I'm watching... fuck!
- Girls, get out of the fuckin' room, please.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.285
Fuckin' asshole.

17:34.286 --> 17:36.519
Will you girls get out
of the fuckin' room?!

17:37.045 --> 17:38.441
Fuck you! Jesus!

17:38.524 --> 17:41.516
Prissy bitch!

17:44.029 --> 17:46.220
Oh, you think that's funny, do you Frank?

17:46.298 --> 17:49.367
- I wasn't laughing about that.
- Why would you kill Madsen?

17:49.368 --> 17:52.894
- He's our fuckin' supplier, Frank!
- We spoke about this.

17:52.904 --> 17:56.073
- We needed to get rid of the middle man.
- Yeah.

17:56.141 --> 17:59.110
"We talked about it"?
We talked about partnering up!

17:59.311 --> 18:03.638
Gettin' a better deal, get a bit more of the action.
I didn't say go bloody shoot him!

18:03.749 --> 18:07.118
Yeah, well, you know, I did try
talkin' to him, and he didn't listen.

18:07.286 --> 18:11.313
- So you just killed him?
- He disrespected me.

18:11.457 --> 18:15.484
Well, he disrespected you!
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

18:16.261 --> 18:18.354
That makes it so much better, Frank.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.567
You do realize they're gonna have our balls for this?

18:23.835 --> 18:26.761
No, no, no. Not our balls.
Your balls.

18:27.305 --> 18:29.703
'Cause, I didn't kill him.
You did.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.677
You want, like, an
apple or something?

18:37.682 --> 18:41.375
Oh Frank, mate... they're
gonna kill you for this.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.647
Well if they kill
me, then I'll die.

18:43.673 --> 18:48.108
But I'm not gonna spend the rest of my
life as some nickle-and-dime pusher.

18:48.393 --> 18:52.227
I did what we needed to do.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.365
So what now?

18:56.768 --> 18:59.198
We move this shit fast.

18:59.423 --> 19:03.323
Give Vinnie his money, maybe kick him a little
extra on the side for the inconvenience.

19:03.575 --> 19:09.384
But when they see that we're delivering the
cash, they're gonna replace Madsen and Tony...

19:10.010 --> 19:11.764
- Wait, wait, wait.
- ...with Franky and Eddie.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.909
You killed Tony too?

19:14.753 --> 19:18.855
Of course you did!
What was it? Buy 1, get 1 free?

19:18.957 --> 19:21.721
Frank... fuckin' mental.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.320
Oh, Jesus.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.458
Hey, come on, man.

19:30.735 --> 19:35.672
Look, if we're gonna do this,
let's get in it to the top.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.575
I mean, Jesus man, one day
somebody's gonna come for me.

19:41.179 --> 19:46.581
Somebody's gonna come for you, but when they do...
I wanna know we put it all on the line for the big money.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.516
We're gonna die... someday.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.517
You wanna die a nobody?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.352
I will never be a fuckin' nobody.

19:57.095 --> 20:01.532
I'm royalty, mate.
A direct descendant from William Wallace himself.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.966
That's what I'm talkin' about!
That's the Eddie that I love!

20:04.991 --> 20:06.069
Huh?

20:06.070 --> 20:08.061
Except, um...

20:08.873 --> 20:12.004
William Wallace got his ass
handed to him by the Brits.

20:12.644 --> 20:17.071
- Fuck you, Frank.
- Cheer up, man. Look at this shit!

20:23.054 --> 20:24.280
Take care man.

20:24.305 --> 20:26.305
All right, see what you got.

20:33.965 --> 20:38.868
Fucking Feds. "Ongoing investigation."

21:04.996 --> 21:07.922
Why the fuck do we always have
to meet so goddamn early?

21:08.132 --> 21:12.091
Because unlike you scumbags, I'm a
contributing member of society.

21:13.071 --> 21:16.437
- What, you still don't trust me?
- I don't trust anyone.

21:16.641 --> 21:18.632
Yeah, well, some people might take that personal.

21:19.043 --> 21:23.070
- What the fuck did you say?
- Just sayin' you have a fucked up outlook on life.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.984
- Might come back to bite you in the ass someday.
- Is that a threat?

21:27.085 --> 21:29.039
Just some advice.

21:32.165 --> 21:35.217
I got some advice for you,
keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.815
Focus on gettin' my
cash every week.

21:37.841 --> 21:41.951
Or you're gonna find out just how
fucked up my outlook on life really is.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.274
What's up?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.640
I checked out that cop who
was at the murder scene.

22:00.665 --> 22:02.318
- Reilly.
- And?

22:02.319 --> 22:04.111
I was right, I had seen him before.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.689
Turned out we had some people check on
that place a couple of months back.

22:08.614 --> 22:11.014
Guess who pops up in
the surveillance shots?

22:12.130 --> 22:14.065
This picture's all we got of him?

22:14.090 --> 22:17.090
- Should I bring him in for questioning?
- No. No, no, you'd...

22:17.936 --> 22:22.366
That'd just tip him off. We still got a bead
on these two that Madsen was selling to?

22:23.041 --> 22:26.943
- You put a tail on him. I want these guys, all right?
- Gotcha.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.084
Hello?

22:43.628 --> 22:44.966
Hey, baby.

22:47.292 --> 22:50.386
Uh, yeah. No, I was, uh,
I was just resting. A little.

22:50.711 --> 22:52.002
No.

22:52.003 --> 22:55.063
No, I didn't forget. It's seven o'clock.

22:55.907 --> 23:01.072
Six o'clock, yeah! Baby... baby... baby...
I promise. Look, I'll be there, okay?

23:02.046 --> 23:03.906
Yeah, I love you too.

23:07.118 --> 23:11.817
- Oh fuck...
- Somebody is in trouble.

23:11.956 --> 23:15.915
- Yeah, when am I not?
- I don't get it, Franky.

23:17.128 --> 23:19.363
What are you doin' messing with this girl?

23:20.432 --> 23:26.796
I mean, she's uptight. She's anal as fuck.
I mean she's, she's high maintenance.

23:27.005 --> 23:30.866
Are you done? That girl is the
only pure thing in my life.

23:31.109 --> 23:35.876
She's the type of girl you marry, y' know,
start a family with.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.289
We're your family.

23:42.815 --> 23:47.173
You think I want to live the rest
of my life in this putrid shit?

23:51.663 --> 23:56.960
First chance I get, I'm gonna take her...
and buy a farm.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.962
- A farm?
- And have a million babies.

24:01.105 --> 24:03.574
Well I can be pure.

24:04.909 --> 24:06.478
Pure, you aren't.

24:10.014 --> 24:12.073
So, let me get this straight.

24:12.484 --> 24:14.236
You've lost my drugs.

24:14.362 --> 24:17.972
No, I didn't, Mr. Scalise. My
associates were brutally murdered.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.058
Do you have my money?

24:21.193 --> 24:23.418
- Mr. Sca--
- Can you get my money?

24:24.028 --> 24:27.930
It's... it's not my fault! It's an
unfortunate incident, Mr. Scalise!

24:29.033 --> 24:32.067
Yeah... it is unfortunate.

24:36.107 --> 24:38.874
Come on, Mr. Scalise... no.

24:41.913 --> 24:45.041
Mr. Scalise, I can't go out like that.
I just can't do it.

24:55.893 --> 24:57.552
Come on, you fucker!

25:27.792 --> 25:30.252
Take this piece of shit out of here.

25:32.029 --> 25:34.998
And find my merchandise.

25:41.973 --> 25:46.708
This is a business, and like most of them,
you have your good share of incompetence.

25:46.744 --> 25:51.904
Morons, ego-centric pricks, simpletons.
They're the ones who give a bad rap on the trade.

25:52.049 --> 25:57.988
You have to stay cool. You have to learn the rules.
You have to study the markets and understand your customers.

25:58.122 --> 26:01.853
You have to minimize risk
and maximize profit.

26:01.959 --> 26:05.053
Basic rules, but so often forgotten.

26:05.930 --> 26:09.866
Let's be honest. This is a
multi-billion dollar industry.

26:10.001 --> 26:14.501
Part of it is legal:
Abuse treatments, prevention costs, healthcare,

26:14.626 --> 26:18.426
DEA budgets, jails, morgues, etc.

26:18.710 --> 26:22.107
Only a small part is illicit.
Less than 20%.

26:22.914 --> 26:27.010
Now, my question would be:
Is it really worth it to eradicate this trade?

26:27.118 --> 26:29.916
I don't think so, and I'm
backed by the government.

26:30.021 --> 26:34.282
Do you have any idea how many people would
lose their jobs if drugs weren't around?

26:34.492 --> 26:39.452
You think any administration would take that risk
to increase the line at the unemployment office?

26:39.731 --> 26:45.670
Of course not. The "War on Drugs" is just another
opportunity to accentuate "The Big Scare."

26:45.970 --> 26:49.496
Foreign cartels, Mexican smugglers, Russian mobsters.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.102
The message is simple,

26:51.108 --> 26:54.976
Beware of the foreigners.
America...

26:55.112 --> 26:59.947
how did you forget your origins?
Don't you remember the melting pot?

27:00.084 --> 27:03.187
And, by the way, don't you
know that the fastest growing

27:03.213 --> 27:05.844
drug in the last
twenty years is meth?

27:06.023 --> 27:08.924
Meth. Pure, white trash.

27:09.060 --> 27:12.123
All this has nothing to do with
morals and the wrong side of the law.

27:12.149 --> 27:14.022
It's all about economy.

27:14.098 --> 27:17.090
This is a business,
and a better one than Wall Street.

27:17.935 --> 27:20.028
They sell hope, I sell dreams.

27:20.137 --> 27:23.301
Most of the time, I sell dreams
to the ones who sell hope.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.399
We're business men, not junkies.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.936
We control this world.
Or at least I thought so.

27:29.146 --> 27:31.510
This is really nice.

27:33.884 --> 27:36.978
But you know, it's not gonna
make everything go away, Frank.

27:38.122 --> 27:41.023
Why do you always get so mad at me?

27:43.060 --> 27:46.052
Franky, you disappeared for weeks, babe.

27:46.897 --> 27:48.888
Seriously, where were you?

27:51.936 --> 27:57.875
You see what I mean? Why does everything
with you always have to be a secret?

28:03.114 --> 28:06.982
How do you expect me to trust you if you don't trust me?

28:09.954 --> 28:16.678
Yeah, you're right. I mean, the job I have, the
night club you know, the night life, it's...

28:17.190 --> 28:22.100
it's good money, but it's not exactly
the best for a relationship.

28:22.387 --> 28:23.649
You think?

28:24.135 --> 28:27.969
- I want to sell the club.
- No, no.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.308
- I don't want you to do that. You don't have to do that.
- Just listen, listen...

28:31.609 --> 28:33.178
I want to.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.872
I don't want to... I don't want
to do this anymore, Ashley.

28:38.983 --> 28:41.975
I want to get out of here and start over,

28:42.086 --> 28:44.953
and buy a horse farm.

28:45.956 --> 28:49.915
A horse farm?
I don't want to live on a farm.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.529
- Okay, so we'll buy something else.
- Something else?

28:52.930 --> 28:58.129
All right, something else, but...
When I see how you are with your parents, and your family,

29:00.004 --> 29:04.065
- And it's kind of boring.
- It's amazing.

29:05.109 --> 29:12.106
It's amazing. It's what I want...
you know, a little Franky runnin' around...

29:12.317 --> 29:15.480
- with your nose.
- But your eyes, though.

29:16.887 --> 29:18.851
Definitely your eyes.

29:19.957 --> 29:21.724
Let's get married.

29:22.807 --> 29:24.307
Oh?

29:25.129 --> 29:27.611
If you're serious...

29:30.000 --> 29:32.250
ask me properly some day.

29:58.729 --> 30:00.123
'Sup, baby?

30:00.705 --> 30:02.764
- Wanna party? Come on.
- What do you got?

30:03.134 --> 30:05.419
I got some good shit.

30:15.913 --> 30:19.007
- Want some of this, darlin'?
- No, I don't want some fuckin' blow.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.053
- Come on, girl.
- No, I want some cash.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.436
Come on...

30:27.162 --> 30:30.547
Come on, you take care of me...
come on!

30:30.961 --> 30:32.929
- You fuckin' get your hands off me!
- Come on.

30:36.634 --> 30:39.029
- Crazy fuckin' whore!
- Fuck off!

30:54.519 --> 30:55.893
- This the guy?
- Yeah.

30:55.975 --> 30:58.643
All right, you go talk to him. Bring him
back here, we'll show him the picture.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.210
All right, cool.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.254
- Hey buddy.
- 'Sup?

31:07.565 --> 31:10.443
Hey, I've got a couple of questions to ask you.
Why don't you come back with me to the car real quick?

31:31.722 --> 31:34.187
What the fuck, man?
I didn't do shit!

31:34.224 --> 31:37.125
We're gonna ask you some
questions, you're gonna answer.

31:37.595 --> 31:40.655
- Fuck you, 5-0.
- Let's make one thing crystal, amigo.

31:43.033 --> 31:44.928
Are we clear now?

31:46.671 --> 31:50.266
- Do you know this guy?
- That dude's dead, man.

31:50.608 --> 31:54.490
Brilliant. Now, who's moving in on this action?

31:55.045 --> 31:58.442
Some guy named Eddie.
Big-mouth, likes to party.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.143
Where can I find him?

32:00.636 --> 32:04.329
I dunno, he hangs out at this
white-boy bar, Melrose and Vine.

32:10.561 --> 32:11.643
Thanks.

32:11.732 --> 32:14.845
- We're not gonna arrest him?
- We're done here, let's go.

32:18.862 --> 32:20.474
Fuck off!

32:20.638 --> 32:24.768
Jesus! Can someone tell me how
I just missed him again?!

32:26.577 --> 32:28.772
Oh my God, you were closer that time.
You were closer.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.308
Hey. Hey!

32:35.220 --> 32:37.788
Girl at the bar in the leopard print?

32:39.624 --> 32:46.404
- She says, "Try it again."
- Oh... don't we have a wild one in here girls tonight?

32:51.135 --> 32:53.957
To taming you, Princess.

32:56.563 --> 32:59.833
Jesus! Fuck, again?
I missed him again!

33:00.278 --> 33:03.876
Eddie! Eddie, enough already.
I'm runnin' out of shot glasses!

33:04.314 --> 33:06.759
Fuck your glasses, mate.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.634
Just calm down, somebody's
gonna get hurt.

33:09.859 --> 33:11.405
Oooh...

33:11.922 --> 33:14.980
Did he just tell me to calm down?

33:14.981 --> 33:19.335
- I think he did.
- Ralph, Ralph, can you give us a minute, old son?

33:19.360 --> 33:22.540
Don't you ever tell me to calm down!

33:22.667 --> 33:26.196
Do you understand?
'Cause I will buy this bar,

33:26.421 --> 33:30.542
and I'll make you the busboy, and
let's see how fast you can duck!

33:30.941 --> 33:33.767
Now bring me some more shots in here!

33:35.146 --> 33:40.103
Excuse me. Come on over, my dear!

33:41.185 --> 33:43.153
Maxwell, come in.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.289
It's Haraday...

33:45.323 --> 33:47.416
do you see anything yet, sir?

33:48.226 --> 33:50.194
It's pretty quiet down here.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.996
Didn't I tell you to
maintain radio silence?

33:53.564 --> 33:57.182
Uh, yes sir, uh, sorry sir.
It won't happen again.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.861
Look Haraday, if anything happens
you'll be the first to know.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.856
Thank you, sir. I won't
let you down, promise.

34:03.207 --> 34:07.826
- Anything you need, just ask.
- Some soy sauce would be nice.

34:10.514 --> 34:14.610
- Really?
- No, just stay in position.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.193
Bartender.

34:30.513 --> 34:31.719
Stripper.

34:32.337 --> 34:35.272
- Actress.
- Hi.

34:35.891 --> 34:39.196
But you? I think you may be different.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.657
You might have a real job.

34:42.922 --> 34:47.324
Possibly, like a nine-to-five job.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.928
Now, you've got the looks.

34:51.222 --> 34:53.329
But do you have the brains?

34:53.853 --> 34:56.958
If I had to take a stab at
this, I would maybe say...

34:58.175 --> 35:01.056
- Lawyer?
- Accountant.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.627
I knew it! I was close.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.433
I was close.

35:06.470 --> 35:10.559
- Why are you here?
- My boyfriend broke my heart,

35:10.908 --> 35:16.978
- was tired of crying about it.
- That means you can just, make up for lost time.

35:17.415 --> 35:21.787
Yeah. Yeah, my revenge period.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.878
I'm lookin' for a guy named Eddie. Scottish?

35:26.357 --> 35:30.659
I'm exactly the type of guy your
boyfriend would hate to see you with.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.655
- Is that right?
- It's most definitely right.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.780
Check mate.

35:44.742 --> 35:47.540
Eddie!

35:51.615 --> 35:53.674
- There's gunshots!
- Get out there!

35:55.619 --> 35:56.910
Get over here!

36:14.023 --> 36:16.290
Police! Don't move,
turn around!

36:16.740 --> 36:18.234
Got any weapons on you?

36:32.556 --> 36:34.615
Where'd they go?

36:39.830 --> 36:42.123
Don't move!

36:43.701 --> 36:45.692
- Nice job, Haraday.
- Thanks, sir.

36:46.570 --> 36:49.762
- Move your ass!
- All right, that's it. Let's go.

36:50.608 --> 36:54.250
Come on, Eddie!
Somebody wants to talk to you!

36:57.926 --> 36:59.326
Ahh!

37:01.098 --> 37:03.066
Oh!
Oh, fuck!

37:05.723 --> 37:08.624
Doin' okay?
You all right?

37:08.726 --> 37:11.661
Need a break? Huh? Need a break?
Oh, he wants to take a break.

37:12.329 --> 37:16.095
Shouldn't have let you take a
shot at me, Scottish prick!

37:18.736 --> 37:21.095
- Aw, fuck!
- Do you got a sore hand there, son?

37:21.195 --> 37:23.154
Sore hand? How's your hand?

37:25.709 --> 37:28.533
You broke... my fuckin' hand!

37:29.813 --> 37:31.762
How you feelin'?
You all right?

37:32.716 --> 37:34.707
How you doin'? How's your balls? Square?

37:35.553 --> 37:36.827
Good?

37:38.722 --> 37:40.781
You all right, son?

37:42.560 --> 37:45.620
You stupid fuckin' wanker.

37:47.665 --> 37:50.632
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Wouldn't do that if I was you, Eddie.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.736
Aw fuckin' hell!

37:52.803 --> 37:57.251
Don't take one further step, 'cause
I will blow his fuckin' brains out.

37:57.575 --> 37:59.365
Go ahead, I got three more.

38:01.345 --> 38:03.404
Drop the gun, Eddie.

38:06.750 --> 38:11.551
- You been a silly boy, my friend.
- It looks like it, right?

38:12.690 --> 38:14.658
Fuck.

38:14.758 --> 38:16.971
You could at least wait till I was ready.

38:28.672 --> 38:30.640
Fucker!

39:07.678 --> 39:10.192
- Hey, hey.
- "Hey, hey, hey" what?

39:10.581 --> 39:12.640
- What?
- Hmm? Hmm?

39:14.511 --> 39:15.837
What about Eddie?

39:15.887 --> 39:18.025
- He's not home.
- Are you sure?

39:18.225 --> 39:21.121
Eddie, I got a bottle of Dom and
two chicks that wanna meet you!

39:21.692 --> 39:23.246
He's not home.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.820
Maybe I can stay.

39:26.597 --> 39:30.152
But not long, 'cause I have class in the morning.

39:30.177 --> 39:31.601
You got class in the morning?

39:31.602 --> 39:33.370
- I do.
- And you have it early?

39:33.404 --> 39:35.429
- Teachers... are up early.
- Mmm. Right. Mm-hmm.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.568
This... is gonna rock.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.274
- Franky?
- Whoa!

39:52.374 --> 39:54.696
- What? You don't pick up your phone?
- You can't knock?

39:55.826 --> 39:57.794
It's Eddie.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.238
Are you sure
they were cops?

40:03.264 --> 40:06.727
Well, they weren't fuckin' wearing
the uniform, but they had guns...

40:06.827 --> 40:09.032
and they were asking me fuckin'
questions, what do you think?

40:09.673 --> 40:13.575
- Wait, what... like, like Feds?
- I guess. I don't really know.

40:13.677 --> 40:16.194
Think, Kathy. Where is Eddie now?

40:16.294 --> 40:18.555
I don't fucking know.
Why don't you go find him?

40:19.310 --> 40:21.768
- Okay, we're goin' to the club.
- No, we're not fucking going anywhere.

40:21.769 --> 40:24.008
What, are you nuts? The cops are
swarming the place right now.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.283
The cops don't give a shit about you, Kathy!

40:26.557 --> 40:28.390
Know what?
Fuck you.

40:28.726 --> 40:31.920
- I got company anyway.
- Company?

40:35.566 --> 40:37.501
- What the hell is this?
- She's a friend, all right?

40:37.526 --> 40:38.501
- A friend?
- Yeah.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.560
And you fucking brought her here?
Are you out of your mind?

40:41.605 --> 40:44.540
She saved my life.
What have you done for me lately?

40:45.542 --> 40:47.737
What's going on, Frank?

40:49.580 --> 40:51.548
Listen, look...

40:53.584 --> 40:56.638
- I want to go home. Please.
- Look, there's an emergency, at the club.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.787
Can you just take my car.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.574
Look, I'm sorry. I'll call
you in a couple hours.

41:00.758 --> 41:04.525
- Can you just do this for me?
- Whatever. I shouldn't have even come here.

41:04.595 --> 41:07.621
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley! Please listen.
Don't leave like this.

41:08.532 --> 41:09.809
What?

41:10.634 --> 41:13.728
You want me to be excited that you've got
two girls making out in your living room?

41:13.837 --> 41:17.534
That has nothing to do with me.
Come on, you know that's Eddie's girl!

41:17.775 --> 41:22.410
Why are you even with me, Frank?
Your life and your friends...

41:22.780 --> 41:25.806
None of this is me.

41:29.753 --> 41:32.586
Ashley, Ash...

41:56.713 --> 41:59.122
Hey! He's right in there.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.162
Eddie!

42:02.380 --> 42:05.172
You shouldn't take the beating
personally, Eddie, it's just business.

42:05.556 --> 42:06.851
Strictly business.

42:07.395 --> 42:08.198
Hey! Uh...

42:08.218 --> 42:10.448
Oh, here's our friend. Come in.

42:10.627 --> 42:14.529
- What the hell is goin' on here, Eddie?
- Calm down son. Just calm yourself down.

42:14.631 --> 42:19.534
- Calm down? Who the hell are you?
- Franky, just chill, all right?

42:19.736 --> 42:23.809
Yeah, take it easy, Frank.
And don't raise your voice!

42:23.841 --> 42:28.670
- Hah, fuck off!
- Frank! I need you to calm down.

42:28.770 --> 42:30.476
Who the fuck is this guy, Eddie?

42:31.982 --> 42:36.633
Hold on, no need for the violence.
Our friend here is just ventin'.

42:38.589 --> 42:42.548
Now that's just the reaction 'cause
you feel threatened, you're scared.

42:42.759 --> 42:45.968
But you're thinkin' with your balls,
my friend, which is not good.

42:46.093 --> 42:48.091
I need you to start thinkin' with your head.

42:48.632 --> 42:50.691
Give our friend a chair.

42:52.703 --> 42:57.640
Frank, I need you
to do what he says.

42:57.841 --> 43:00.810
Now listen fellas,
I've got a problem.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.560
You know, I like this guy.
I really do.

43:05.019 --> 43:06.919
But I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

43:07.584 --> 43:10.055
My merchandise has gone missing.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.610
And when I lose my merchandise,
to make me feel better,

43:14.264 --> 43:16.211
I have to kill somebody.

43:16.780 --> 43:18.494
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

43:18.697 --> 43:23.305
Vin, Vin... As I was sayin'
before my friend walked in,

43:23.753 --> 43:30.430
We... will find your stuff, we'll sell it,
we'll fill your pockets with cash.

43:30.674 --> 43:34.051
- Loads of cash!
- Yeah, I like cash.

43:34.811 --> 43:37.575
But I have a slight problem.

43:37.781 --> 43:42.650
I've got two associates,
bullet holes in the back of their heads.

43:42.853 --> 43:45.754
Oh I see, aye, that could be a problem.

43:45.822 --> 43:49.588
Look, I can't bring back the
dead, but the way I see it...

43:49.760 --> 43:54.629
anybody workin' for you, guv'nor, they
should take better care of themselves.

43:54.731 --> 44:00.164
And, more importantly,
better care of your product.

44:01.705 --> 44:03.397
And you think you can?

44:03.740 --> 44:06.732
Oh, we most definitely can.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.593
That was for your friend pissin' me off!

44:26.763 --> 44:29.630
You really should teach him some manners, Eddie.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.503
Now this is how it's gonna be.

44:33.770 --> 44:38.174
You find and sell my coke for
full street value in two days.

44:38.742 --> 44:43.068
Otherwise, I'm gonna come back and kill you

44:43.680 --> 44:46.581
and your rude friend.

44:47.718 --> 44:51.745
- Is that clear?
- Crystal.

44:52.789 --> 44:54.780
Good.

44:59.563 --> 45:01.531
Two days, Eddie.

45:01.698 --> 45:04.758
Two fuckin' days.

45:07.604 --> 45:09.799
Don't disappoint me.

45:12.976 --> 45:14.696
Let's go.

45:14.745 --> 45:16.654
Two days, Jesus.

45:16.680 --> 45:20.910
Two days! Two fuckin' days.

45:24.821 --> 45:30.555
- Well, that was fuckin' brilliant.
- How is any of what just happened brilliant?

45:31.595 --> 45:34.579
We're fuckin'
alive, Frank!

45:35.799 --> 45:40.532
Your shitty plan actually just fuckin' worked.

45:41.571 --> 45:44.563
You know what?
I knew it would.

45:44.708 --> 45:46.676
- Come on, come on. Let's get up.
- Aw, fuck.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.369
There we go, you all right?

45:49.545 --> 45:51.327
You didn't know it would work.

45:51.748 --> 45:54.776
- What are you talkin' about? Yeah, I did.
- You were shittin' your pants!

45:54.801 --> 45:58.130
Get the fuck outa here! You were halfway
up his ass with that whole speech thing.

45:58.555 --> 46:00.633
- Jesus, he got you good.
- Fuck.

46:00.724 --> 46:02.393
- It fuckin' worked, man.
- It worked!

46:02.418 --> 46:04.010
It fucking worked!

47:21.171 --> 47:23.139
You did good, Eddie.

47:26.686 --> 47:28.054
Thank you.

47:28.712 --> 47:30.680
Now, fuck off.

47:59.643 --> 48:01.353
Does anyone wanna...

48:01.778 --> 48:03.407
...party?

48:15.725 --> 48:17.693
How do you feel?

48:22.942 --> 48:24.442
All right!

48:24.568 --> 48:26.536
Let's do this.

48:33.810 --> 48:35.778
So, have we got anything
on Scalise yet?

48:35.812 --> 48:39.543
Nothing we can make stick, but we got
more than enough on these two other guys.

48:39.683 --> 48:41.651
Oh yeah, the Madsen replacements.

48:41.818 --> 48:43.786
What about Agent Royce?

48:43.787 --> 48:46.888
- She's waiting outside with a full report.
- Royce. Come here.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.694
What do you have for me, Royce?

48:52.696 --> 48:57.531
I've, um, been able to integrate into
their group, I've earned their trust.

48:58.602 --> 49:00.863
They even discuss business
transactions in front of me.

49:01.271 --> 49:03.239
That's good work!

49:05.642 --> 49:10.645
I understand that, uh... you had to get romantically
involved with one of the girls in the group?

49:10.814 --> 49:12.782
So tell me about that.

49:13.583 --> 49:16.609
It's... all in my report, sir.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.746
Oh yeah, I'm gonna read this thoroughly.
You can count on that.

49:20.824 --> 49:25.169
Um, I believe that we have more than
enough to put these guys away.

49:25.362 --> 49:28.454
- I agree, we should bust these guys right now.
- And let Scalise walk?

49:29.566 --> 49:31.020
And put us back to square one?

49:31.046 --> 49:33.852
You know, our mission is not to
bust some little dealer here.

49:34.571 --> 49:40.601
All due respect, sir, these guys aren't exactly pushing
dime bags on the corner. They're moving a lot of product.

49:41.611 --> 49:45.048
Okay Maxwell. You put a team in the apartment next to them.

49:45.582 --> 49:48.813
If nothing happens in the
next two weeks, we'll move in.

49:49.653 --> 49:53.627
But nobody, and I mean nobody,
moves in for two weeks.

49:53.827 --> 49:55.065
And I don't care what for.

49:55.322 --> 49:56.535
- Yes, sir.
- You understand me?

49:56.626 --> 49:58.594
- Yes, sir.
- I do. Yes, sir.

49:58.619 --> 49:59.595
Okay...

49:59.596 --> 50:01.564
Let's go get it done.

50:02.666 --> 50:04.634
- Beverly.
- What?

50:06.293 --> 50:08.777
What the hell was Thompson talking about?
You getting involved with somebody?

50:08.872 --> 50:11.097
Evan, come on. It's part
of the job, you know that.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.542
- We okay?
- Are we?

50:15.645 --> 50:19.809
- Look, I'm just worried about you.
- Okay, well...

50:20.617 --> 50:23.328
- I know what I'm doing.
- I've seen a lot of agents go in under,

50:23.329 --> 50:26.325
and it's never easy. I don't want you to get
involved with something you can't get out of.

50:26.422 --> 50:29.879
You knew the risks when you first met me.

50:30.672 --> 50:32.397
Come on, Beverly, don't lecture me.

50:32.444 --> 50:33.844
Okay.

50:34.631 --> 50:38.505
You know what, if you can't keep your
personal feelings out of the job, then...

50:38.601 --> 50:41.985
maybe we need to rethink our relationship.

50:52.716 --> 50:56.550
Yo, Frank, I like chillin' with you and
everything, but I ain't got all day, son.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.688
I'm here on business,
you feel me?

51:01.791 --> 51:05.693
I heard you all were stocked and shit,
so I'm gonna need like a half a brick.

51:06.663 --> 51:08.631
Fuck. Half a brick, huh?

51:08.665 --> 51:13.625
Yeah, I'm steady makin' moves, man.
Goin' out there grindin' and hustlin' and shit.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.562
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

51:16.773 --> 51:19.968
- Did I say you could use my blender?
- No, you were playing the video game.

51:19.969 --> 51:21.841
I was fuckin' hungry, man.
I haven't eaten all day.

51:21.845 --> 51:24.392
- What the fuck, get the fuck out of there, man!
- What are you doin', man?

51:24.417 --> 51:26.557
Aw, Jesus! You used my chocolate
ice cream? Fuck, man!

51:26.583 --> 51:28.504
- There was only a little bit left, bro.
- Fuck! You don't just--

51:28.600 --> 51:30.130
What do you want? What are
you throwin' that out for, dawg?

51:30.568 --> 51:33.537
You don't come in here, and just
use somebody else's shit. You--

51:33.556 --> 51:35.993
- Where's your cup?
- You didn't have no cups.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.895
I looked all around for cups
and you didn't have none.

51:38.127 --> 51:40.413
You drank straight out of
the fuckin' container?

51:40.663 --> 51:43.305
- That's just grimy, dude.
- That's your opinion, son.

51:43.306 --> 51:44.952
- Fuckin' grow up, man.
- Why you gotta get all...

51:44.953 --> 51:50.104
Why you trippin', dawg? Just smoke that J, and
fuckin' play your video games and relax, dawg!

51:50.573 --> 51:51.963
- All right.
- It's all good!

51:52.642 --> 51:55.577
- So, what's up? Can I get that shit or what?
- Nope.

51:55.712 --> 51:56.814
Why not?

51:56.851 --> 52:01.500
You can't just fuckin' walk in here, expect to get
half a kilo of coke. This isn't high school, man.

52:01.618 --> 52:03.677
Where do I keep it?
Under the fuckin' couch?

52:03.820 --> 52:07.596
- All right, so, but like...
- You can get it tomorrow, it's gonna be 15 G's for half a kilo.

52:07.641 --> 52:11.652
15 grand! What, are you crazy, dude?
I can get it for, like, 10 anyplace else, bro!

52:11.761 --> 52:14.628
Then get it 10 anyplace else.

52:16.533 --> 52:19.593
Well, if I bust it... all right, I'll
come tomorrow but can I get a sample?

52:21.704 --> 52:25.740
Why you laughin', dude? That's my reputation. And I need
to make sure that shit's good, you know what I'm sayin'?

52:25.775 --> 52:28.676
I mean, this is my career path.
You feel me, dawg?

52:28.778 --> 52:33.160
I feel ya', dude. So, your reputation better be
solid, 'cause you are not getting a sample.

52:33.250 --> 52:36.275
For-- oh all right, cool, fuck it.
All right, I'll be back tomorrow.

52:36.300 --> 52:37.686
- Yup.
- Shit's fucked up.

52:37.687 --> 52:41.589
- Mm-hmm. Stay the fuck out of my fridge.
- I didn't even go in your fridge, bro.

52:41.691 --> 52:44.941
- I saw you lean towards it.
- LRT, dawg. That's what I'm sayin'.

52:44.966 --> 52:48.445
Loyalty, respect, and trust. You
fuckin' lose in all them shits, man.

52:48.475 --> 52:51.402
- BLT! That's your code.
- Fuck you, dude.

52:51.983 --> 52:53.951
Fucked up my game, piece of shit.

52:59.776 --> 53:01.172
Yo, what's up, baby?
Where you goin'?

53:01.377 --> 53:02.898
- Fuck off.
- Aw, why you gotta be like that?

53:03.146 --> 53:05.205
- Creep!
- Come on, man.

53:06.243 --> 53:08.601
Damn! You saw that shit?

53:09.766 --> 53:12.415
- You're late, Scott.
- Come on, don't call me that, man!

53:12.440 --> 53:15.801
It's Sweetness. How many times I
gotta tell you? It's, it's Sweetness, bro.

53:15.802 --> 53:20.593
- Lighten up, Scottie. You get what I need to know?
- You know, I don't need this shit, man.

53:20.663 --> 53:22.688
I mean, don't informants
get paid or somethin'?

53:24.678 --> 53:26.378
Chill out, yo!

53:27.204 --> 53:28.854
Yo! What the fuck are you doing?

53:28.855 --> 53:30.194
- Arresting you.
- For what?

53:30.340 --> 53:32.810
- Possession.
- That's fuckin' bullshit, man!

53:32.835 --> 53:36.132
Listen, fuck-face. I don't care
about you, your stupid name...

53:36.232 --> 53:40.483
If you don't wanna be a snitch, you should've thought
about that before you started messing with me.

53:40.683 --> 53:43.965
Now you got one choice.
Do you wanna be a live snitch?

53:44.388 --> 53:45.541
Or a dead one?

53:45.841 --> 53:49.165
- Okay. Okay, relax.
- I'm only gonna ask you once,

53:49.265 --> 53:51.407
who's moving Madsen's shit?

54:14.651 --> 54:16.619
- All set?
- Aye.

54:17.554 --> 54:18.984
Don't fuck this up.

54:22.425 --> 54:24.605
As we know, this is a layout
of the apartment here.

54:24.727 --> 54:31.627
We're gonna be in here. Anything goes to shit, we'll go out,
stack in the corridor, move down here, knock and announce.

54:31.727 --> 54:33.773
Garcia, anybody in there you'll take 'em down?

54:33.803 --> 54:37.703
Contain 'em, okay? Four and
Five will go bedroom 2 and 3.

54:37.707 --> 54:41.725
Then One and Two will move
on to bedroom 1, right here.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.934
Let's go, guys.

55:18.628 --> 55:20.157
Frank?

55:24.754 --> 55:26.722
Frank, baby, are you okay?

55:28.725 --> 55:30.693
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

55:31.761 --> 55:33.729
You've just been in there a long time.

55:35.565 --> 55:37.533
You good?

55:37.800 --> 55:39.768
Yeah, no, I'm okay, baby.

55:47.374 --> 55:49.374
I'm okay...
I'm okay...

55:56.153 --> 55:58.121
Come home with me.

56:02.825 --> 56:06.556
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- What, are you mad at me?

56:07.630 --> 56:10.004
You were so distant during dinner today.

56:10.600 --> 56:13.728
- If you didn't want to be here, why'd you even come?
- Come on, Ash, you know that...

56:14.704 --> 56:17.328
this... all of it, is just stressful for me.

56:17.807 --> 56:20.882
- I know.
- So that mean you're gonna come home with me?

56:24.714 --> 56:26.682
Maybe.

56:40.563 --> 56:42.531
This is ridiculous, Frank.

56:43.633 --> 56:45.601
Why did we come all the way up here?

56:46.769 --> 56:48.737
I like this place.

56:50.740 --> 56:54.506
For romance? Have you
gone soft on me, Frank?

56:55.611 --> 56:57.602
Your girlfriend not doin'
it for you anymore?

56:58.581 --> 57:00.674
Would you shut up? I'm trying
to tell you something.

57:02.652 --> 57:04.643
Should I be gettin' worried?

57:06.823 --> 57:08.791
I'm gonna quit.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.753
Sure.

57:14.797 --> 57:16.765
Aw, you're kidding.

57:23.573 --> 57:25.541
You're not?!

57:25.808 --> 57:27.776
Why would you want to quit?

57:28.711 --> 57:31.703
Frank, you just killed two men.

57:32.715 --> 57:34.740
For a sweet, sweet deal.

57:36.619 --> 57:38.587
And you want to quit?

57:39.689 --> 57:41.656
Well, I ain't givin' up.

57:41.657 --> 57:44.717
No, I know. And I wouldn't expect you to.

57:45.695 --> 57:47.720
That's what I want to talk to you about.

57:48.765 --> 57:52.131
- You should just take over.
- What happened?

57:52.702 --> 57:58.399
Nothing happened, you know. It's just...
I don't like where this is goin', man.

57:58.808 --> 58:01.868
I'm fucked up
half the time,

58:01.894 --> 58:04.476
doin' crazy
shit,

58:07.817 --> 58:13.619
I don't know, man. It's like I'm losing it. If I don't
get out now, I'm gonna do something really stupid.

58:14.690 --> 58:16.658
It's time to move on.

58:18.795 --> 58:20.763
I suppose with that girl?

58:22.632 --> 58:24.600
What, you wanna get married or something?

58:25.735 --> 58:29.671
- Eventually.
- That's going to complicate our friendship.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.083
- You do know that, right?
- How?

58:32.108 --> 58:32.941
Oh, what?

58:33.572 --> 58:40.410
What do you think I'm gonna do? Start coming 'round,
dressed up as Santa Claus, bringin' gifts for your kids?

58:40.411 --> 58:42.546
And them calling me uncle?

58:42.752 --> 58:48.588
It's gonna get to a point, Mrs. Frank
is not gonna want me around anymore.

58:49.559 --> 58:53.723
So... why don't you try doing
what I'm doing, man?

58:53.796 --> 58:56.765
'Cause I'm good at what I do!
And so are you.

59:00.636 --> 59:02.729
This is the last batch, and then I'm done.

59:05.842 --> 59:10.609
I'm disappointed.
Do you remember when you came and I set you?

59:13.616 --> 59:17.992
I put a roof over your head... I mean,
I helped you out. I got you started!

59:18.268 --> 59:19.496
What do you want from me? I owe you.

59:19.822 --> 59:26.660
So, that's it. This was your master plan.
A one-hit wonder, and you're out.

59:26.762 --> 59:28.753
What are you talking about, man?
I didn't have a plan.

59:29.665 --> 59:36.628
It's just sometimes... sometimes your
actions just take you in different paths.

59:38.841 --> 59:40.734
Well, what can I say?

59:44.780 --> 59:46.748
I wish you the best, Frank.

59:49.719 --> 59:51.687
Thanks.

59:55.558 --> 59:57.549
I wish you the best.

59:58.828 --> 01:00:03.731
Now let's get the fuck out of here.
I fuckin' hate this place! It's shite!

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:13.824
Now, in the legal world, when you turn out
to be a poor businessman you go bankrupt.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:18.711
You may lose your line of credit, your assets,
worst-case scenario, your house.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:22.574
In my line of work, most of
the time you lose your life.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.895
So it's important to have a Plan B.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:30.151
An exit strategy.
My way out is Ashley.

01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:33.511
My way out is to build a normal
life outside of all of this.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:38.305
I've been putting money aside, and sooner
than later, I'm gonna be able to retire.

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.730
Yeah, I might miss the action or
the thrill, but I'll be alive.

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:47.542
Maybe have kids. Three bedroom
house with a manicured lawn,

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:52.673
and a pool. Somewhere in suburbia.
I'll call that... bliss.

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.403
- Thank you for this.
- I'll call it heaven.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:01:01.696
Babe, I'm really sorry. I haven't
been the most understanding lately.

01:01:01.757 --> 01:01:06.758
- And I know you have a lot on your mind.
- Don't. Don't, don't be sorry.

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.131
Okay?

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:18.535
I got you now, you little bastard.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.812
- What's up, boss?
- How are you?

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.788
Good, man.
Can I get in?

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.247
No, you can't.
Sorry, you're not on the list.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.397
Have a good time.

01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:25.564
Whoa, easy, killer. Didn't
know she's private property.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.240
No disrespect, man.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:43.942
- Hey, no offense...
- You already said that.

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.690
Name's Jack Reiley.

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:56.957
- Jack, that's my name.
- Look, it's cool, man.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.598
Why don't you find somewhere
else to play, all right?

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.638
You're Frank, right?

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:11.578
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

01:04:13.682 --> 01:04:15.650
I'm off duty.

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.745
Is that right?

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:27.619
It's just a job, man.

01:04:29.698 --> 01:04:31.666
I guess it is.

01:04:34.703 --> 01:04:38.662
- So, officer Reiley...
- It's detective, actually.

01:04:38.807 --> 01:04:40.775
No shit!

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:44.193
- Why do you know me?
- Oh, I been askin' around.

01:04:44.613 --> 01:04:46.581
I wanted to meet you.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.618
Well, you found me.

01:04:54.723 --> 01:04:56.691
Do you mind?

01:04:57.726 --> 01:04:59.694
You guys got it made
here, you know that?

01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:04.629
- Money, women.
- Why don't you give us a break?

01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:10.805
Come on.

01:05:12.897 --> 01:05:14.888
- Hey!
- That is a fine ass.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.450
You know, if I had it to do over
again, I don't think I'd be a cop.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.150
So quit.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.677
Yeah, I probably should,
but then I keep thinking

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:29.655
Pension... You guys got some
hot shit goin' on here, though.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.620
All I do is run a strip joint, man.

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.765
It's really not that glamorous.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:43.015
Ooh... wow, that's some good shit.
Where'd you get that?

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.774
- That's not mine.
- No?

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.669
Mind if I keep it?

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:58.548
You know, I used to get some good shit like
that from a friend of mine. Maybe you know him.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.884
- I doubt it.
- Madsen?

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:05.692
No? Doesn't ring a bell?

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.798
He's dead, anyway.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:15.799
You got a point to make, man?
'Cause you're just really killin' my party.

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.799
What? You think I come here to arrest you?

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:24.568
Why would I come up here and do that?
I know everything about you.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:28.650
I know where you live, I
know what time you wake up.

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.844
Hell, I know when you take a shit, pal.

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:35.918
I know if that pretty little girl of yours
knew what you were doin' here tonight, well...

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.706
- You talk a lot.
- No, that's the point.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:43.598
I don't say anything.
What I know I keep to myself.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:49.323
- So, what's your deal?
- Same as you.

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:54.835
Power, women, money.

01:06:56.745 --> 01:06:58.713
My money.

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.675
Consider it an insurance policy.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.714
- You're a dirty cop.
- No, I'm a smart cop.

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.685
Yeah. No, I
get it, man.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:17.106
- What's your price?
- Oh, I'm sure we can work something out.

01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:21.146
Yeah. Yeah, no, we'll, uh...
we'll work something out.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:25.606
What do you think?
A hundred?

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.012
Yeah, right.

01:07:30.779 --> 01:07:32.747
A thousand dollars. Huh?

01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:37.061
What am I talkin' about?
A thousand dollars?

01:07:37.161 --> 01:07:40.922
A thousand dollars? That's not even
getting you a good blow-job in this town.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.526
I mean, for an officer of the law,
it's gonna cost me a lot more, right?

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.759
Tell me, how much is it gonna cost me?

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.840
For a detective...

01:07:52.299 --> 01:07:54.384
to suck my dick?

01:07:56.104 --> 01:07:58.088
You cannot be that stupid!

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:01.833
You piece of shit!

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.754
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.471
Johnny! Get in here!

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:18.118
- Fuckin' break, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:08:18.193 --> 01:08:20.452
- Help me over here!
- You come in here and startin' shit?!

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.979
- Get him, Frank.
- Get him, Franky.

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:29.118
I was having...

01:08:29.144 --> 01:08:30.468
FUN!

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.029
Up until you...

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.953
FUCKED IT UP!

01:08:34.812 --> 01:08:35.705
You come in...

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.729
MY CLUB!

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.615
You ask me for fuckin' MONEY!

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.917
- Piece of shit!
- That's enough, Franky.

01:08:45.943 --> 01:08:47.654
He's a cop, Johnny!

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:51.683
He's a fucking cop. How do you let
a cop in here, you fucking pig?

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:58.656
What the fuck, Frank?
And who the fuck is that?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.661
That's a cop.
And he wants money.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.488
You wanna give him money?

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:08.863
A cop? Money?
Not our fuckin' money.

01:09:08.865 --> 01:09:10.341
I do.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.578
You want my money?

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.352
Kathy, get me my money.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.777
Get me my fucking money!

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.140
Okay.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.634
Okay, Jack.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.792
I got your fuckin' money.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:40.768
Come in my club? Threaten me?
And my friends?

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:44.643
- Franky, let's get out of here now.
- Threaten my fucking girlfriend?!

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:47.582
Huh?

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:01.353
- Get this piece of shit out of here.
- You got it, boss.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.821
Fuck!

01:10:06.668 --> 01:10:08.636
Turn the music back on!

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:11.534
Start fuckin' dancing!
Now!

01:11:23.745 --> 01:11:25.618
Beverly, you okay?

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.753
Can you control this?

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.556
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.559
Hey...

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.547
They shot that dirty cop tonight.

01:11:42.622 --> 01:11:43.846
- Reiley?
- Yeah.

01:11:43.988 --> 01:11:46.966
- They kill him?
- No, no. No, no. I don't...

01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:49.454
I don't know, but...

01:11:51.673 --> 01:11:54.230
Think I'm puttin' a stop to this.
You're done here.

01:11:54.255 --> 01:11:55.743
No, no! Don't do that.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:58.155
- Don't do that.
- Bev, you're too deep into it.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.244
Evan, don't do that! You can't do that!
What do you...

01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:04.557
You can't just pull me now.
What did I do all this for, then?

01:12:06.788 --> 01:12:11.097
Look, I just... I just needed to see you. Okay?
I just needed to... I just...

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:14.362
needed to know that I'm doing the right thing here.

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.698
Okay?

01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:24.015
Okay, but... you know, if you
find you're out of control,

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.608
just forget about the case, you just walk away.

01:12:27.809 --> 01:12:29.777
Yeah.

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:33.715
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:44.819
Just promise me, okay? Just promise me
that you'll be there when this is done.

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:49.560
- Okay, I promise. Be careful.
- Yeah.

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:16.624
Well, Franky...

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.793
this ain't good.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:23.698
This most definitely is not good.

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.622
I'm in the mood for Mexican.

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.830
What about you?

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.500
Well...

01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:52.088
I love Mexican.

01:13:56.358 --> 01:13:58.492
Let me get this straight,

01:13:58.817 --> 01:14:00.817
you were mugged?

01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:03.778
Right. Then they took your gun,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.059
and shot you in the hand.

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.990
What were you doing downtown?

01:14:10.562 --> 01:14:12.361
That's where they dumped me.

01:14:13.475 --> 01:14:16.740
Right. Right, so you
were kidnapped too.

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:20.458
Tell me again, how many were there?

01:14:20.687 --> 01:14:22.968
- Three.
- Three?

01:14:23.057 --> 01:14:26.431
- White? Black? Hispanic?
- I already gave a report.

01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:29.588
Jack, there were traces
of cocaine in your blood.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.754
And "a bag of cocaine in the right
pocket of Officer Reiley's coat."

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:42.008
You have no explanation, you can't even give us a
positive ID on the guys who supposedly mugged you.

01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:47.576
If you have a substance abuse
problem, the Department can help.

01:14:50.729 --> 01:14:54.688
- Dammit, Reiley! You have to talk to me!
- It's all in the report.

01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:59.662
Okay. That's the way you want it.

01:15:00.813 --> 01:15:04.970
- You're suspended without pay indefinitely.
- Dammit, Deb, don't do that!

01:15:05.088 --> 01:15:07.347
We've known each
other twenty years!

01:15:07.624 --> 01:15:10.371
Long before you fucked
your way to Captain.

01:15:11.638 --> 01:15:14.705
Thanks for making this a lot easier on me.

01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:22.841
I'm... I'm sorry, Deborah.
I didn't mean that.

01:15:23.883 --> 01:15:26.374
I just need a couple more days.

01:15:26.686 --> 01:15:31.203
I'm in the middle of something big here,
I'm gonna break this wide open.

01:15:31.996 --> 01:15:36.106
Internal Affairs has an ongoing
investigating on you, Jack.

01:15:36.233 --> 01:15:41.429
I don't know what you're into, but the shit is rolling down
from a lot higher than this office. My hands are tied.

01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:45.621
If I were you I'd get myself a good lawyer.

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:51.127
Since you don't have your
fucking gun I need your badge.

01:16:11.452 --> 01:16:12.904
Ahh.

01:16:26.129 --> 01:16:27.729
Fuck!

01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:36.184
What the fuck do you want?

01:16:36.409 --> 01:16:38.098
Do you mind keeping your
hands where I can see 'em?

01:16:38.998 --> 01:16:40.998
You gotta be kidding me.

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:44.122
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:48.419
Now why would a perp steal a cop's
gun, shoot him through the hand,

01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:50.947
then leave him alive
to talk about it?

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:54.083
World's full of psychos.
Take you, for instance.

01:16:54.159 --> 01:16:58.197
You know what I think?
I think you knew the person who shot you.

01:16:58.472 --> 01:17:01.186
I think they knew you well enough
to know you wouldn't talk,

01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:03.576
because you're too dirty to start airing out laundry.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.989
I don't give a flying
fuck what you think.

01:17:06.267 --> 01:17:09.910
- Do you even remember why you became a cop?
- Oh, and you do?

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:13.871
I'm sure you love runnin' around for
eighty grand a year, takin' it in the ass,

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:17.360
while some two-bit punk uses
your head for target practice.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:20.794
- That's the job.
- You're something else.

01:17:21.362 --> 01:17:25.858
You're so fuckin' self-righteous. You really
think you're making a difference? You're not.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.296
You're not getting drugs off the street. For
every one you arrest, three more pop up.

01:17:31.352 --> 01:17:33.924
"The job."
The fuckin' job's a joke!

01:17:34.708 --> 01:17:37.957
Look around! You'd better face it, Maxwell,

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:42.808
whatever goals you set for yourself in the
beginning of this, you're failing miserably.

01:17:43.089 --> 01:17:46.699
I just want to make enough to retire.
Get out of this shit-hole.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.078
Go someplace tropical,
Costa Rica, anywhere but here.

01:17:52.352 --> 01:17:57.790
You know, my first case...
There was this junkie mom out in Nevada.

01:17:57.832 --> 01:18:02.442
She's shooting up, but her baby wouldn't
stop crying, messing with her high.

01:18:03.186 --> 01:18:06.201
So this HIV-positive waste of a life,

01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:09.912
decides to stick her own baby
girl with her own syringe,

01:18:10.165 --> 01:18:12.597
shooting her up with smack to quiet her down.

01:18:13.524 --> 01:18:18.435
By the time I got there, baby was dead and mom
was halfway there. Nothing I could do about it.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.003
You know, when I first started,
my goal was to save the world.

01:18:24.028 --> 01:18:28.912
Now twenty years in, I just wanna make sure
guys like you don't make it to Costa Rica.

01:18:29.949 --> 01:18:31.816
I've seen a million guys like you.

01:18:34.698 --> 01:18:37.189
One day you're gonna fuck up.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.048
And I'll be there.

01:18:57.906 --> 01:18:59.485
Franky-boy...

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:04.479
Do you remember a cartoon with, uh,
Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny?

01:19:04.579 --> 01:19:05.401
Which one?

01:19:05.402 --> 01:19:09.225
Sam's chasin' Bugs.
And Bugs runs right into this house.

01:19:31.248 --> 01:19:34.931
So, Yosemite Sam starts
poundin' down on the door...

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:37.893
And Bugs opens the door.

01:19:38.843 --> 01:19:42.779
But he opens it dressed as a chick.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.906
- Hi.
- You datin' Frank?

01:19:46.106 --> 01:19:52.322
So, Yosemite Sam's like, "Pardon me, ma'am.
Pardon me, but I'm lookin' for a yellow-bellied rabbit."

01:19:52.369 --> 01:19:54.579
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Bad decision.

01:19:54.594 --> 01:19:56.327
And then he comes bustin' into the house,

01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:57.749
Where the fuck are you goin'?

01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:08.632
Bugs runs to a door, jumps in front of it,
"He's not in here! No, he's not in here!"

01:20:08.677 --> 01:20:11.475
- God damn it, get back here!
- No! No!

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:13.801
Where are you goin'?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:16.888
No!!

01:20:16.891 --> 01:20:22.491
Boom! This big cannon!
Just blows him away! Right?

01:20:26.332 --> 01:20:28.940
So, at that point, Bugs runs to another door,

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:34.471
- "He's not in here! He's not in here!"
- And Sam's still buyin' this?

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.443
Are you fuckin' crazy?

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:38.910
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

01:20:39.212 --> 01:20:41.164
So Sam runs over to the door...

01:20:43.552 --> 01:20:45.415
opens the door again,

01:20:47.636 --> 01:20:52.374
Boom! This big cannon, again!
Just blasts him!

01:20:54.770 --> 01:21:02.063
So, at this point, Sam's stumblin' around,
burnt, totally fucked up and shit, right?

01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:10.956
Bugs Bunny runs to another door,
"He's not in here! He's not in here! No!"

01:21:21.254 --> 01:21:28.351
Sam's like... "I'll take your word for it, ma'am.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.749
I'll just take your word for it."

01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:35.965
I love Yosemite Sam!
Sanchez, we're good.

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:37.223
Later.

01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:55.374
What happened?

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:58.769
- You fell asleep, Haraday. That's what happened.
- Sorry.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.215
- Anything?
- Uh, yeah.

01:22:03.651 --> 01:22:10.346
1:37, Agent Royce and two female suspects arrive,
one blonde, 5'7 " and the other 5'2", a brunette.

01:22:10.446 --> 01:22:15.177
At about 2:23 I think one of them went to
the, uh, grocery store, she came back at 2:48...

01:22:15.236 --> 01:22:17.379
Haraday. Anything good?

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.412
- All right, try to stay awake, will you?
- Yeah.

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:24.216
- At least keep those things around your ears.
- You got it.

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:32.334
You know, like, when you were in school and you
had to, like, do your dream homes and your...

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.602
your like, fantasy what you want to be...
you know, all that stuff.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:42.520
Like, what did you see?
What did you... what was it?

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.982
What was the thing that you... wanted?

01:22:50.152 --> 01:22:55.293
Well, first of all, they... we never had that.
I don't think I really went to school very much.

01:22:55.549 --> 01:22:59.197
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:05.141
All right, well then, let's play a game.
If you had to do that now...

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.516
What do you think?

01:23:12.999 --> 01:23:14.699
Um...

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:21.972
I don't know, I always used to like, uh...
to like animals.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:26.622
- Animals, really?
- Yeah. I wanted to, uh...

01:23:28.889 --> 01:23:34.041
I used to feed this cat, and
you know, I wanted to save all the...

01:23:34.067 --> 01:23:39.333
the dogs in the world, and
the cats, and... the turtles.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.901
- The turtles?
- I know. It's so random.

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:45.551
That's very sweet.

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:52.007
I wanted to open up like a... like
a five-star, like animal shelter.

01:23:52.008 --> 01:23:55.530
- It sounds really stupid.
- No, it doesn't sound stupid at all.

01:23:55.848 --> 01:23:58.675
- You know, like, not depressing.
- Yeah.

01:23:58.856 --> 01:24:01.799
You know, like, you go to the animal
shelters and it's, like, it's disgusting.

01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:05.801
It's like just... they don't
clean it, it's like sad.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:12.083
I want to have a five-star animal shelter.

01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:14.489
With a pool.

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:21.157
- That's the best thing I've heard in a long time.
- And, like TV's for like, the cats, you know.

01:24:21.282 --> 01:24:24.913
So like, they can not be depressed, and everyone's happy.

01:24:32.289 --> 01:24:35.132
- Shit. I don't know.
- What is it?

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.240
Well, turn it up.

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:54.521
- Great job, Haraday.
- Yeah, you caught Royce with her girlfriends. Great work.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.103
Move.

01:25:00.612 --> 01:25:02.683
Agent Royce has a wild streak, huh?

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:06.068
- Bet you had a pretty good time with her, huh chief?
- Shut up, Waters.

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.921
Sir, I think I have something.

01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:13.875
- On the screen.
- All right, what is it?

01:25:15.576 --> 01:25:17.703
- That's Reiley.
- What the hell's he doing here?

01:25:18.479 --> 01:25:20.447
Keep movin'.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.655
- Please... please don't do this...
- Fuckin' be quiet..

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:33.712
Okay, you know... you know what, you guys?
I'll get the door, you guys just relax.

01:25:33.812 --> 01:25:36.382
- You guys just stay here and relax.
- Okay.

01:25:38.786 --> 01:25:40.567
Hold on...

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:43.435
Back! Get in there!

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.731
Stop your fuckin' bawlin'!

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.631
Shut the fuck up!

01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:49.731
Okay, okay...
Be cool, be cool...

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.683
So then Bugs says, "Eh, why'd
you pour oil on my head?"

01:25:59.117 --> 01:26:00.169
Right?

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:03.091
- Frank.
- Okay, your, your Yosemite one's better?

01:26:03.099 --> 01:26:07.124
- Frank, just stick to sellin' drugs, babe!
- Aw, come on! That's funny. That's funny.

01:26:07.528 --> 01:26:11.464
Why'd you... with the carrot and everything?
That's funny, man! What are you talkin' about?

01:26:12.157 --> 01:26:17.925
- Don't give me... you know, I'm done. I'm...
- Aw, Jesus! The fuckin' door's open again.

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.394
Kathy!

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.842
Shh! Listen.

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:26.410
- You need to talk to her about that.
- Never learn.

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:29.064
- Come here.
<i>- Kathy!</i>

01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:31.943
Get down.
Get down!

01:26:32.663 --> 01:26:35.632
Don't make a fuckin'
sound, I will shoot you.

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:40.010
Okay, we're movin' in! Okay, Waters,
call headquarters, tell 'em the situation,

01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:41.478
- tell 'em we need backup.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:41.603 --> 01:26:43.022
Follow me.

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:56.391
Take a piss.

01:26:56.622 --> 01:26:58.680
Be sure you flush
that toilet, Franky.

01:27:01.956 --> 01:27:03.417
- Fuck!
- DEA!

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.674
Turn around!
Put your hands on your head!

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:07.613
Turn around! Now!

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:09.422
- Secure!
- Fuck!

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:11.262
Shit! Shit!

01:27:11.287 --> 01:27:12.816
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.442
Get up! Get over here!

01:27:18.902 --> 01:27:20.147
NOW!

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.113
DEA!

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:34.871
- There's one for you, Maxwell!
- You put it down, Reiley!

01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:38.276
There's no way out of here!

01:27:38.277 --> 01:27:40.997
- You're surrounded! Put it down, now!
- I'm walkin' out of here!

01:27:43.262 --> 01:27:45.199
<i>Special Agent Waters, we have a man down!</i>

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.454
We need assistance right away!

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:49.415
- Put your weapon down now!
- Not gonna happen!

01:27:54.904 --> 01:27:57.517
Put that gun down now!
Put it down now!

01:27:57.838 --> 01:27:59.806
Fuck you, Maxwell!

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.109
Just stay down. Stay back!

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.638
Let her go!

01:28:06.647 --> 01:28:08.946
You fucked with the wrong guy, asshole!

01:28:08.949 --> 01:28:10.917
It's okay, baby. I got you.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.528
You hurt her, I swear to God...

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.004
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:17.280
Let her go!!

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:19.360
- Just shoot me, prick!
- Fuckin' let her go!

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.602
Ashley!

01:28:31.163 --> 01:28:33.073
You fuckin' asshole, eh?

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:39.713
Back the fuck off, Maxwell!

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.924
There's no way out of here.

01:28:42.783 --> 01:28:44.851
I believe that's my gun, darlin'.

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:48.489
I'll fuckin' kill her!

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.279
All right, stay down!

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.042
Bastards!

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.538
Freeze!

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.710
Stay back!

01:29:11.712 --> 01:29:13.680
Hang on, baby, okay?

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:17.482
I know, I know, I know.
Shh... don't talk, don't talk, don't talk.

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.658
No no no no no no...
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, please...

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.608
This is Agent Royce, where's our backup?

01:29:58.574 --> 01:30:02.097
Hey! Look at me, look at me.
Just do what I say, okay?

01:30:02.098 --> 01:30:03.854
Don't worry about it, just do what I say.

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.600
Come on, stand up.

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.007
Okay, come on.

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.063
I got her.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.678
Keep walking.
Just keep walking.

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:22.683
Stop. Stop.

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.612
Go. Get out of here. Go.

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.521
Go.

01:31:45.185 --> 01:31:46.823
Damn it!

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.520
Guess you're not going to Costa Rica.

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.530
Fuck you!

01:33:49.456 --> 01:33:51.424
I had it all planned out.

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.459
But I failed.

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.654
My fault.

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:56.663
I should have known better.

01:33:57.945 --> 01:34:01.301
I used to say, "I'd rather do business with sharks

01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:02.527
than imbeciles."

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:05.167
At least I'd know what they want.

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:08.424
I'd understand how they'd try to screw me over.

01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:11.926
With imbeciles, you never know.

01:34:12.479 --> 01:34:15.048
I'd rather make a deal with the Vinnie's of this world,

01:34:15.148 --> 01:34:19.875
than with a corrupt cop incapable of
controlling his substance abuse.

01:34:21.098 --> 01:34:23.201
Should have killed him when I had the chance.

01:34:24.082 --> 01:34:26.447
And Ashley...
Eddie...

01:34:26.493 --> 01:34:27.984
the girls...

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.430
They're dead.

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.400
The money's gone.

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.502
Plan A failed.

01:34:36.503 --> 01:34:38.471
So did my Plan B.

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:44.475
I suppose it's time to start Plan C...
