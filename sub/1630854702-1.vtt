00:26.000 --> 00:27.541
Thank you so much.

00:28.041 --> 00:30.958
Thank you. No. I will.

00:31.958 --> 00:33.750
Aw, this looks amazing.

00:36.291 --> 00:39.041
-Dee! Hello.
-Hello.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.791
Mwah!

00:40.875 --> 00:44.041
-Please sit.
-Thank you.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.958
-Okay.
-You look amazing by the way.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.166
Thank you.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.541
Hello.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.875
Hey, so would you like
to order something to eat?

00:53.958 --> 00:55.625
-No. I'm fine, thank you.
-You sure?

00:55.708 --> 00:56.666
Mm-hmm.

00:56.750 --> 01:00.333
'Cause you know it's gonna be weird
watching me watching you eat… watching…

01:00.416 --> 01:01.875
-Yeah? You sure?
-I know.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.083
Okay.

01:04.083 --> 01:07.875
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

01:08.541 --> 01:10.041
It's delicious. Mmm.

01:12.291 --> 01:15.166
-Um, Otis…
-Hmm?

01:16.333 --> 01:17.875
-What are we?
-Huh?

01:18.666 --> 01:21.791
Are we a thing or just a fling?

01:24.833 --> 01:25.833
Excuse me, madam.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.958
-Here is the menu.
-Thank you.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.958
Dee, see I thought
we were keeping things casual.

01:35.041 --> 01:38.750
When you help me, I help you.
We help each other.

01:40.666 --> 01:41.916
Did you change your mind?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.666
I need something
more than just the physical, you know.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.000
Slow down, eh.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.083
It's so hard to put this in words.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.458
I… I think that,

01:53.541 --> 01:57.333
-maybe we--
-Okay, okay. Dee? Um… So…

01:58.041 --> 01:59.125
Ugh!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.625
There isn't an us.

02:05.833 --> 02:06.833
Yeah?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.458
And if you hoped that maybe
things will change down the road,

02:10.541 --> 02:12.416
well, you hoped wrong.

02:13.583 --> 02:14.666
This isn't happening.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.291
I do not do relationships.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.458
Okay?

02:22.083 --> 02:25.708
I mean, come on, look around you. Look.

02:41.416 --> 02:42.416
Uhn?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.000
Okay.

02:49.791 --> 02:51.416
Dee. Dee. Sit.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.833
-I booked a room.
-Fuck you.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.583
Dee. Dee.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.416
Hey, Patricia.

03:20.125 --> 03:23.458
No, I'm just having cake.
By myself.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.458
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

03:26.958 --> 03:30.166
No, I am at uh, Urban Eatery. Yeah.

03:30.250 --> 03:34.166
Come through, come over. Come over.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.416
Dele!

04:11.916 --> 04:14.875
Okay, let's talk about some
of the concerns that you might have.

04:15.958 --> 04:20.416
<i>I can tell you that right now</i>
<i>is not a good time to talk, Otis.</i>

04:20.500 --> 04:21.833
<i>No. Dele, listen</i>

04:24.500 --> 04:28.500
I know it's only been
a year since your mom's funeral,

04:29.125 --> 04:32.708
<i>but if your mom</i>
<i>and my mom were still alive,</i>

04:32.791 --> 04:36.125
they'd be so happy
to see us doing business together.

04:36.208 --> 04:38.916
I'm sorry, but I'm going
to have to respectfully decline.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.916
Dele, please tell me, what does it take
to have your secret change of funding?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.708
Just get it done! Ah!

04:44.791 --> 04:46.750
Um, hold on a second, Otis.
Let me come back to you.

04:46.833 --> 04:47.666
Hey babe, what's wrong?

04:47.750 --> 04:50.666
Ah, like I'm so tired.
Babe, I'm stressed out. I'm, I'm tired.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.041
-Ah, I don't know.
-What can I do to help?

04:54.333 --> 04:55.416
Dele.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.291
Babe, I don't know. Maybe I should
take a month off and and sort things out.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.458
Nonsense!

04:59.541 --> 05:01.291
Not when you're working
on the biggest case of your career.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.458
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

05:02.541 --> 05:03.333
<i>What's up with the wedding planner?</i>

05:03.416 --> 05:05.500
<i>But I told you… Oh babe,</i>
<i>you don't even listen when I talk to you.</i>

05:05.583 --> 05:07.958
I told you this,
I don't trust this wedding planner.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.375
The one I originally wanted
is booked till end of year.

05:12.541 --> 05:15.666
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Just don't worry about this.</i>

05:15.750 --> 05:17.125
-Okay?
-I shouldn't worry about it?

05:17.208 --> 05:19.041
<i>Babe, we have</i>
<i>a very important wedding.</i>

05:19.125 --> 05:20.708
<i>You are telling me not to worry about it?</i>

05:20.791 --> 05:23.125
Okay. Uh, hey Rita!

05:24.041 --> 05:25.250
What do you think,

05:25.833 --> 05:30.375
about a dream destination
wedding in Mombasa?

05:30.458 --> 05:32.916
Otis? He's been listening the whole time?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.833
<i>Uh, hey listen. Uh, it'll…</i>

05:34.916 --> 05:38.833
it would be…
it's a fabulous idea for both of you.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.625
Um…

05:40.708 --> 05:42.125
Hi, Otis.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.875
A traditional destination wedding?

05:47.958 --> 05:49.375
Yeah, let me handle it.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.541
Um Otis, are you even qualified?
What do you know about planning weddings?

05:54.625 --> 05:56.250
What?!

05:56.333 --> 06:00.416
I have a degree. I did a Major
in Wedding Planning. I got you.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.750
Oh okay, Otis.
Um, say we let you handle it, right?

06:03.833 --> 06:05.291
Isn't it too late to find something nice?

06:05.375 --> 06:07.333
Rita, stop this foolishness.

06:07.416 --> 06:08.583
Babe!

06:08.666 --> 06:09.875
Please listen to him.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.541
What can we do about the venue?

06:12.625 --> 06:14.416
Ah. So…

06:15.250 --> 06:17.541
I have a friend, okay?

06:17.625 --> 06:21.000
She is from Tanzania.
She is called Nandi. Wonderful lady,

06:21.083 --> 06:22.875
and she owns a resort.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.875
Can I give her a call
first thing tomorrow morning?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.375
It has to be a Yoruba wedding.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.875
Of course, yes. Yes.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.250
Dude, she's a minute away.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.000
<i>Dele, thank you, okay?</i>

06:39.625 --> 06:40.958
I love you, bro. Mwah!

06:44.916 --> 06:46.833
Oh yo!

06:46.916 --> 06:49.375
That was Dele. He's on board.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.666
We just have to do
some tiny little bitty thing for him.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.458
Love to see you closing deals.
Josh would be proud.

06:59.541 --> 07:00.916
Ah, come on, man.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.750
It's been three years.
Three years since Josh ditched us

07:05.250 --> 07:08.875
and fucked off to Amsterdam
with Belinda. You know, my mom…

07:08.958 --> 07:12.833
My mom left us with the company.
That's how lucky we are.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.333
Nick, into banking.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.333
Let It go. Okay?

07:17.416 --> 07:18.625
Let's have some fun.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.125
Let's party!

07:38.375 --> 07:39.500
Hello?

07:44.125 --> 07:45.458
Anybody home?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.291
Judy?

07:54.291 --> 07:55.375
Madam?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.958
-What the f--

08:23.375 --> 08:25.958
Happy Birthday!

09:32.583 --> 09:35.166
You actually did this for me. Thank you.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.625
It was actually him.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.208
-Who?
-He set it up.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.291
This monkey? Lies.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.500
Monkey?

09:42.583 --> 09:43.875
You're welcome, TK.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.041
And don't you say

09:45.125 --> 09:46.125
I have
never done anything for you.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.416
Have you though?

09:48.416 --> 09:50.541
You should actually
take some credit too, Celine.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.125
You know, for helping plan all of this.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.583
Yes! My man, Dele.

10:05.666 --> 10:06.791
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.791
Is everything okay?

10:09.875 --> 10:10.958
Mm-hmm.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.666
Do you have a minute?

10:12.750 --> 10:13.708
Yeah.

10:13.791 --> 10:14.791
Um…

10:15.416 --> 10:16.333
What's up?

10:16.833 --> 10:18.375
I just wanted
to take you out for a thank-you drink.

10:18.458 --> 10:21.958
I mean this party is… It means a lot.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.083
Uh yeah, when, when were you thinking?

10:27.166 --> 10:29.208
Next week. Friday?

10:29.291 --> 10:32.083
-Next week. Friday?
-Mm-hmm.

10:33.208 --> 10:37.083
Let me just check the calendar,
you know, just in case uh…

10:38.791 --> 10:42.791
see what I'm up to on Friday. Hey,

10:43.333 --> 10:45.125
-it's Valentine's.
-Oh is it?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.916
Yes.

10:47.000 --> 10:47.916
You know this--

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh. Hi, Otis.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.125
te.

10:52.666 --> 10:53.541
Belinda.

10:55.583 --> 10:56.416
Hey.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.041
Valerie.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.375
Grace.

11:04.791 --> 11:05.958
-Uh…
-I'm just gonna…

11:06.791 --> 11:07.791
No.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.500
Uh T, TK…

11:39.125 --> 11:40.458
Three million.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.958
That's my final offer.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.500
How about we do this?

11:47.416 --> 11:49.250
We sell for 3.5 million…

11:49.333 --> 11:50.208
Mm-hmm.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.708
…you pay two million now,

11:51.791 --> 11:55.125
that covers the first half pay
for my services and the vendors.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.208
If everything is good to your liking,

11:57.291 --> 12:00.875
you pay the remaining 1.5.
That covers the rest of my pay,

12:01.583 --> 12:04.000
the professional video
and the wedding album.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.166
How does that sound?

12:08.916 --> 12:09.916
Sounds good.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.958
Draw up the contract by tomorrow
and I can send the first pay.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.208
Sounds good to me.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.750
Perhaps, we can discuss
the wedding details over lunch.

12:38.583 --> 12:42.500
In all fairness, setbacks
in any projects are inevitable.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.625
Thankfully here at Pinnacle Development,
we have contingencies in place.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.458
And because of that, I can assure you,

12:48.958 --> 12:51.750
the estimated completion date
for the Capilano Plaza,

12:51.833 --> 12:54.500
is May 2025. Thank you.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.000
Okay. Ladies and gents, any questions?

12:58.750 --> 12:59.708
Miss Maina,

13:00.250 --> 13:03.333
in a culture where
it takes months to break ground,

13:03.416 --> 13:06.041
what makes Pinnacle Management different?

13:06.125 --> 13:08.541
In the last ten years,
out of 40 Kenyan projects,

13:08.625 --> 13:10.041
fifteen were completed on time.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.791
A third of all those 15 were Pinnacle.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.541
And that is why you're here, right?

13:14.625 --> 13:15.708
Fair enough.

13:16.291 --> 13:19.750
But how do I respond
to my partners at Fairmont Capital,

13:19.833 --> 13:22.875
when they hear it's some woman
who will be running the show?

13:23.666 --> 13:26.041
That is a very brave question to ask me.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.750
Well, since I started
working with Pinnacle,

13:28.833 --> 13:31.833
our overrun costs moved from 8.5 to 3.95.

13:31.916 --> 13:33.958
That is half of the industry's average.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.833
I need something
more convincing than your credentials.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.291
Try a personal touch.

13:39.791 --> 13:41.541
How about effective communication?

13:41.625 --> 13:45.291
Choosing the right team, exceptional
risk management. Is something funny?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.208
TK, um uh…

13:47.916 --> 13:50.041
we already closed on Fairmont last week.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.958
They absolutely loved you.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.875
So, everyone here

13:55.208 --> 13:56.791
knows that except you.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.416
So I am the last to know.

14:00.625 --> 14:01.541
So you're not a sexist.

14:03.916 --> 14:04.791
She's feisty.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.208
I'm not so sure
you want to tell her the other news.

14:10.041 --> 14:11.208
What other news?

14:21.958 --> 14:23.333
Now Selena,

14:23.416 --> 14:26.541
please tell me
how are things between you and Richie?

14:28.458 --> 14:31.666
Her name is Celine. My name is Richard.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.208
-Richard. Celine.
-Oh,

14:33.291 --> 14:35.375
I'm sorry. I struggle with names.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.125
It's okay.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.000
Please continue, Selena.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.916
Celine.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.375
Please stop correcting her, Richard.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.041
Look, she should be able
to get our names right.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.666
But she just said
she struggles with names.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.208
It's the least she can do considering
how much we're paying her, babe.

14:53.750 --> 14:54.833
You see?

14:54.916 --> 14:57.416
His narrow mindedness
is what I have to deal with everyday.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.750
And now it's gotten to a point
where he has a complete disregard

15:00.833 --> 15:04.208
for my personal time and my space
and something has to change if--

15:06.208 --> 15:08.875
Oh sorry, I forgot
to put my phone on silent.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.333
I have to pick this.

15:13.041 --> 15:13.875
Jeremy.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.291
What is it?

15:16.375 --> 15:17.875
Yes, I froze your credit card.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.375
Do you want to take back your words?

15:20.458 --> 15:24.041
Okay, please do so before
I consider becoming a widow.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.166
Spouses!

15:27.250 --> 15:29.583
Please continue, Selena.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.708
Celine! Celine. "Ne," "ne".

15:36.791 --> 15:37.833
Oh, sorry.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.500
Now you see how I feel.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.250
Actually, I don't.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.166
Look, Richard.

15:50.666 --> 15:52.125
I love you.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.583
And I know that you mean well

15:53.666 --> 15:56.666
and I am really trying to make this work.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.458
It's just that sometimes I feel so…

16:00.125 --> 16:02.750
just so suffocated when I'm around you.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.791
Babe,

16:04.583 --> 16:07.500
last year when you said I should
put in more effort in the relationship.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.625
I put my best foot forward. I actually--

16:14.208 --> 16:15.333
Jeremy.

16:16.791 --> 16:20.000
I am at work trying to get an income,

16:20.083 --> 16:23.000
which some of it
is going to offset the stupid…

16:23.083 --> 16:25.000
Yes, the stupid debts you put us into.

16:25.791 --> 16:27.500
Please don't call me again.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.916
If you do, I'm going to
circumcise you a second time.

16:33.583 --> 16:37.458
Oh now, I have an assignment for you two.

16:37.541 --> 16:41.500
And it's going to be very helpful
especially for you, Richie.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.916
Dad, you owe me 80,000 bob.

16:55.708 --> 16:57.583
Eighty thousand, why?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.333
Okay, forty thousand.

17:00.916 --> 17:02.916
Now you're changing. What's your basis?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.916
Your socks don't match
your trousers, that's why.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.250
My socks don't match the uh…

17:10.750 --> 17:12.708
You are not even wearing socks.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.083
Okay.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.750
Ten minutes TV, and then you go to bed.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.583
-Promise?
-Promise.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.333
-Ten?
-Minutes.

17:26.416 --> 17:27.458
High five.

17:28.708 --> 17:29.625
Love you.

17:50.166 --> 17:53.166
So business is looking good.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.416
We have a new investor.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.416
And…

17:57.916 --> 17:58.875
That's good.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.333
I'm proud of you.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.458
How are things with your dad?

18:06.208 --> 18:07.541
What do you think?

18:10.416 --> 18:11.625
-Priti--
-Stop.

18:12.833 --> 18:13.833
I'm good.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.375
You, you are you.

18:18.791 --> 18:20.500
And we're here.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.500
I risked everything
for a love that did not exist.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.500
Let's just raise her.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Okay?

18:39.041 --> 18:40.208
What are you watching?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.083
Can I watch with you?

19:01.625 --> 19:04.750
I'm amazed! It fits perfectly.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.416
Nandi, how are you?

19:14.250 --> 19:15.458
Hi, dude.

19:15.958 --> 19:18.541
I've been trying to get
a hold of you for the last two weeks,

19:18.625 --> 19:19.625
<i>and it's not happening.</i>

19:19.708 --> 19:20.958
<i>What's happening?</i>

19:21.041 --> 19:23.041
And this Liz lady of yours,

19:23.125 --> 19:25.791
that you were telling me
about is yet to get in touch with me.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.541
Can I please know what's going on?

19:27.625 --> 19:30.875
<i>Is this wedding happening or not?</i>

19:30.958 --> 19:32.125
Let me know.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.708
<i>Um, let me call her.</i>

19:40.458 --> 19:44.666
<i>Sorry, the mobile</i>
<i>subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

19:46.625 --> 19:47.916
Just a minute.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.875
Pick up, pick up.

19:55.958 --> 19:57.833
<i>The mobile subscriber</i>
<i>you're calling is unavailable.</i>

19:58.541 --> 19:59.833
I'll be back.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.083
This was a good second meeting.

20:05.708 --> 20:08.375
I just wish Erastus was here.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.458
He has an urgent project to complete,

20:11.541 --> 20:13.291
but he sends his apologies.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.250
It's important to have
one sitting for the two.

20:17.833 --> 20:22.000
Absolutely. He's just been so busy
with work at my dad's company.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.166
Trying to prove himself.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.166
But you know,
he's not getting married to your father,

20:27.666 --> 20:29.500
or that business of his.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.875
It is you he gets
to share the rest of his life.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.833
That's something to consider.

20:35.458 --> 20:37.375
Share my warmest regards to everyone.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.125
Most certainly, Pastor Eric.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.333
-Take care, eh?
-You too.

21:18.708 --> 21:20.333
Fuck!

21:27.458 --> 21:32.000
It's the strain

23:22.291 --> 23:25.791
Khalid! Khalid, Khalid.

23:29.416 --> 23:30.333
Dude,

23:30.833 --> 23:32.000
what the fuck?

23:32.625 --> 23:35.875
Khalid, I caught you at a good time, man.

23:35.958 --> 23:39.291
You are looking nice.

23:39.375 --> 23:42.041
This suit suits you well.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.166
Wish I could say the same for you.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.125
Khalid.

23:59.625 --> 24:03.166
I had to do the fucking
presentation in Dar-es-Saalam,

24:03.250 --> 24:04.875
by myself, for a second time.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.791
You know, you'll have to fly one day.

24:08.875 --> 24:12.666
Yeah, it's not gonna happen. Anyway,

24:12.750 --> 24:17.500
I have a very interesting story for you.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.875
Would you like to drink me for a join?
Ha, would you like to join me for a drink?

24:25.083 --> 24:26.916
Huh?

24:43.333 --> 24:44.916
Yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.125
Khalid, Khalid, Khalid.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.708
I fucked up.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.958
I fucked up. Badly.

24:57.833 --> 24:58.833
What did you do?

24:58.916 --> 25:04.291
Aw, who did I do? Who, not what?! Who?!

25:13.625 --> 25:14.625
Hey!

25:14.708 --> 25:16.625
What are we celebrating?

25:24.208 --> 25:27.375
Well, what's going on here?

25:28.375 --> 25:30.333
Find a new man?

25:35.666 --> 25:38.833
You, are looking at Pinnacle's Management

25:38.916 --> 25:42.041
new Vice President of Projects.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.541
Bitch, I'm a boss.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.250
-You got promoted?
-I got promoted!

25:45.333 --> 25:47.625
-Oh my goodness. Congratulations!
-I know.

25:47.708 --> 25:48.791
Thank you.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.250
And you are baking too.
Who have you become?!

25:54.625 --> 25:55.791
TK.

25:58.416 --> 25:59.500
TK.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.083
I hope you didn't have too many.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.333
-Oh.
-Huh? Hmm?

26:12.375 --> 26:16.041
Bitch, I'm a boss. Fuck.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.416
Judy!

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
Judy!

26:35.041 --> 26:35.875
Shit.

26:36.916 --> 26:38.875
-Judy!
-Judy!

26:38.958 --> 26:41.500
-Judy!
-Judy!

26:42.041 --> 26:45.166
Yoh, she didn't…hey!

26:45.250 --> 26:46.875
-Deputy Jesus.
-Judy.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.583
You know, now that
my career is on track,

27:21.666 --> 27:23.750
I thought I'd really be happy, you know.

27:24.833 --> 27:26.416
Living my best life…

27:27.875 --> 27:30.250
My love life is the shambles.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.208
At least you have some hope.

27:34.208 --> 27:37.583
I keep trying to express to Richard
that I need some time to myself.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.375
Then every time
that I do need some me time,

27:40.458 --> 27:43.708
he finds a way
to penetrate himself in there.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.708
Like, if I knew that moving
into his area would be this bad,

27:46.791 --> 27:48.625
I would have just stayed where I was.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.791
Cause like at this point,

27:50.875 --> 27:53.708
my biggest fear is that
if I move in with him,

27:54.541 --> 27:56.375
I'll strangle him in his sleep.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.625
And the only word
that I heard, is penetrate.

28:01.375 --> 28:04.333
Hmm. Look who's up.
Hey, welcome back.

28:06.916 --> 28:09.541
What do you think of
the unethical monogamy?

28:10.041 --> 28:11.458
Polyamory?

28:11.541 --> 28:14.833
There's a difference.
I mean one, you are open to it,

28:14.916 --> 28:16.625
and you know who the others are.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.833
Polyamorous is…

28:19.916 --> 28:22.125
It's like fornication, eh.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.375
But I think we're just tied up
at so many expectations

28:26.458 --> 28:28.750
because truly, can one person,

28:28.833 --> 28:31.333
truly give you all you need and want?

28:33.041 --> 28:34.875
If you put it that way…

28:36.625 --> 28:38.833
I think we should just accept
the new way of life.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.625
And who knows? It could
bring an end to cheating, heartache…

28:44.833 --> 28:48.000
-You know…
-He is fucking my dad's secretary.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.875
I actually liked her.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.000
That little bitch.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.500
Fuck.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.666
-Can I help?

29:07.958 --> 29:09.166
-Sis…
-It's okay.

29:25.666 --> 29:28.458
Otieno, it's six. What the fuck?

29:28.541 --> 29:30.208
Dele arrives in less than a week

29:30.291 --> 29:34.833
and is expecting a lavish wedding
at the coast that I promised.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.041
Huh?

29:36.125 --> 29:38.500
I'm not panicking. Do I look
like I'm panicking? I'm not panicking.

29:38.583 --> 29:39.791
What? Help me.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.041
Okay guys, I'm sorry.
I know this is off topic,

29:42.125 --> 29:44.416
but why do all of you look like shit?

29:44.500 --> 29:47.791
Well, apart
from you, Richie. Hi, Richie.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.166
Hi, uh…

29:49.875 --> 29:53.125
It's Richard, but I see
motherhood looks good on you.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.750
Oh, thanks Richard. I love it.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.291
Oh. Okay guys,

29:57.375 --> 29:59.625
can we please get back
to my falling apart life?

30:00.208 --> 30:01.625
Chill the fuck out, Otis.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.375
Mom, you said a bad word.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.125
No. I didn't say…

30:05.208 --> 30:07.875
I said yuck. Like, yuck the chill out.

30:07.958 --> 30:10.333
Jesus of Nazareth, guys!

30:10.416 --> 30:14.250
Dele and Rita are flying on Friday, okay?

30:14.333 --> 30:17.000
<i>And that's why I'm turning</i>
<i>to every one of you to please,</i>

30:17.083 --> 30:20.458
<i>please help me out.</i>
<i>I know, I know I messed up.</i>

30:20.541 --> 30:22.458
<i>Okay? But at least the hotel is booked.</i>

30:22.541 --> 30:24.125
My girl, Nandi, she's got me.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.250
Oh, one of your little whores.

30:26.333 --> 30:28.291
No, TK. She's not a whore.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.791
<i>And I don't do whores.</i>

30:30.375 --> 30:33.625
Judy um,
why are you still wearing sunglasses?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.125
Oh, that's why it's so dark.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.958
Guys, please I need you!

30:40.041 --> 30:43.666
Please, I'm begging, help me!

30:43.750 --> 30:45.375
Okay? It's the coast.

30:45.458 --> 30:47.291
Well to be honest, it's very tempting,

30:47.375 --> 30:48.708
but um, I'll just pass.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.958
Robin, I know you despise me.

30:51.041 --> 30:53.083
No, it's not about that. I mean um,

30:53.666 --> 30:55.000
I have children to look after.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.416
-Yeah, motherhood. You know these things…

30:57.500 --> 30:58.916
Hey, Cyril!

30:59.416 --> 31:01.791
Stop, drop that. Put it down.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.958
Okay guys, I gotta go. Good luck! Okay.

31:05.041 --> 31:05.875
Cyril.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.458
I'm out.

31:07.541 --> 31:08.583
It's your mess, Otis

31:08.666 --> 31:10.625
It was a bad idea to begin with.

31:10.708 --> 31:11.791
Khalid,

31:12.458 --> 31:14.958
it affects you
just as much as it affects me.

31:15.041 --> 31:18.333
If we don't handle this,
we won't make it past the fourth quarter.

31:18.416 --> 31:21.291
You're pathetic. I'll book a ticket.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.416
Guys, I'm on vacation.

31:22.500 --> 31:26.791
I don't intend to spend it
doing damage control, okay?

31:26.875 --> 31:28.166
Good luck, Otis.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.708
TK.

31:29.791 --> 31:32.000
No, thanks. And besides you have Nandi.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.791
What kind of name is that?

31:33.875 --> 31:36.041
She is Tanzanian.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.625
What should I do about it?

31:38.125 --> 31:41.208
Also, I have a fear of flying.
So can I please borrow your car?

31:56.166 --> 31:59.708
I guess that's what
a four-year relationship looks like.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.458
Boring and complacent.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.958
Is that why you swing
from one cleavage to another?

32:08.041 --> 32:10.500
Man, what's wrong with you?

32:10.583 --> 32:13.041
Just asking, jeez!

32:13.916 --> 32:15.375
Okay then, can we talk
about something else?

32:16.458 --> 32:18.500
Yeah, like…

32:18.583 --> 32:19.875
Like what? Like…

32:20.375 --> 32:21.916
like how you got duped?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.000
-Richard…
-Hmm?

32:41.083 --> 32:44.291
when I was napping, why didn't you
tell Otis to stop by the Man Eaters?

32:46.625 --> 32:49.416
Last I checked,
we were giving each other some space.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.083
In this case, verbally, Celine.

32:51.166 --> 32:54.375
Well, it would have been nice to stop
there seeing as it's a historical site.

32:54.458 --> 32:55.291
I wasn't aware.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.750
I hinted about it yesterday.

32:57.833 --> 33:00.291
Celine, do I look like I can read minds?

33:02.625 --> 33:03.875
Clearly not.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.916
Oh shit!

33:25.500 --> 33:27.125
You and your heavy foot.

33:41.333 --> 33:42.416
Where are you going to?

33:43.083 --> 33:44.541
We're headed this way…

33:47.375 --> 33:49.291
Why are you over speeding?

33:50.000 --> 33:53.666
Boss, we weren't speeding. The speed
limit for the highway is 110km/hr.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.666
Here it's 80km/hr.

33:56.916 --> 33:57.916
Alight from the vehicle.

34:14.833 --> 34:18.250
The way I see you, you look
like a very reasonable person.

34:18.333 --> 34:22.125
Why were you speeding? And you know
the fines are usually very high.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.750
Then show us the speed gun.

34:25.833 --> 34:29.458
If we were speeding, we will pay
the fine and I will go to court.

34:30.916 --> 34:33.458
You know, if we factor in the speed gun,

34:33.958 --> 34:35.708
It's a whole lot…
eh, that's a big process.

34:35.791 --> 34:38.208
Because I'll have
to go to the station. So much work,

34:38.291 --> 34:39.458
you know, a lot of paperwork.

34:39.541 --> 34:41.750
Officer, we have
all the time in the world.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.541
You don't have to pull that card,
eh? What is in your wallet?

34:45.625 --> 34:47.291
Er…

34:47.375 --> 34:51.125
It's not much but…

34:51.833 --> 34:53.041
Here.

34:54.041 --> 34:55.916
Bro, why are you giving me a condom?

34:56.708 --> 34:58.791
For you to be safe
when you are taking bribes.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.916
Get out of here, you idiot!

35:07.708 --> 35:09.250
-Idiot!
-Officer!

35:09.333 --> 35:11.041
-See you later.
-Go away!

35:11.125 --> 35:14.375
That one is an idiot.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.958
…an introduction.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.041
You're welcome.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.208
-Hi.
-Nandi!

35:47.041 --> 35:48.708
Nandi, Nandi.

35:48.791 --> 35:51.375
-You've pissed me off, Otis.
-What?

35:51.458 --> 35:54.625
I keep on calling you every time
and you are not answering my calls.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.833
Come on give me a hug.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.541
-How are you?
-I'm great. You look good.

36:04.625 --> 36:05.625
Thank you.

36:06.250 --> 36:11.166
So, I have rooms booked for you
and for your wedding guests.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.000
Everything else is sold out.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.833
Unless otherwise, if you want
to pay for executive rooms.

36:17.416 --> 36:20.541
Okay. Uh, hi guys. This is Nandi.

36:21.166 --> 36:22.250
Nandi, these are the guys.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.916
Hi.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.000
Also, we will be sharing rooms.

36:27.083 --> 36:30.250
Ah, in that case, my girlfriend
and I would like to get a suite.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.375
I heard you say something about executive.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.541
No. No, baby.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.875
Come on, why not?

36:35.958 --> 36:37.416
'Cause it's not in our budget.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.375
I'll make a discount for you.

36:39.458 --> 36:40.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

36:42.750 --> 36:45.250
Oh. The two of you
make a cute couple together.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.416
Thank you.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.375
I'll take one of those too.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.375
For you it will have to be a full rate.

36:56.833 --> 36:57.750
What?!

37:00.083 --> 37:01.958
Just get the executive suite, right?

37:54.458 --> 37:55.500
-Goodnight.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.666
Everyone, please turn
to page two of the plan.

39:08.208 --> 39:11.833
These are your assigned tasks
based on your strengths.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.541
Do we have, uh, a list
of local vendors we can tap into?

39:14.625 --> 39:17.791
Of course. Even wedding
planners around here, we have.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.500
Unluckily, the event planner
we were to hire on the day of the wedding

39:22.583 --> 39:23.416
is not available

39:23.500 --> 39:26.541
because he has another wedding.

39:27.208 --> 39:28.958
Okay. Uh, Rita's words,

39:30.541 --> 39:33.500
"Otis, we must get
the Yoruba music right."

39:33.583 --> 39:35.125
So they're flying in their own DJ.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.791
Oh, excellent.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.625
Uh… Excellent, yes.

39:40.291 --> 39:43.333
Okay! Uh yeah, one last thing.

39:44.166 --> 39:45.625
They fly in on Friday.

39:45.708 --> 39:46.583
What?!

39:46.666 --> 39:48.250
-Otis, what?
-What?!

39:48.333 --> 39:49.291
What the fuck? Otis!

40:02.333 --> 40:04.416
Okay. Talk to me.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.083
<i>Show me the big white one again, Dad.</i>

40:07.166 --> 40:08.166
Big white…

40:08.666 --> 40:10.208
Priya, I've shown you like five times.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.958
Help me choose. Which one?

40:12.041 --> 40:15.583
<i>They all look really yummy</i>
<i>but you should pick that one.</i>

40:16.208 --> 40:17.333
This one?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.166
Are you sure?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.291
Uh, I wouldn't go for a fondant cake.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.541
Fondle. What is fondle cake?

40:24.625 --> 40:26.750
There's nothing to fondle. Fondant.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.041
Fondant.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.375
I'd suggest, uh, buttercream cake.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.916
<i>I say fondant cake. Is TK there?</i>

40:33.000 --> 40:34.958
<i>She always knows what to do.</i>

40:35.041 --> 40:37.208
Young lady,
when did you become this smart?

40:37.291 --> 40:39.666
I love you. Mwah, mwah. Daddy loves you.

40:41.458 --> 40:44.125
So you were saying, uh, fondle cake?

40:44.208 --> 40:45.208
Fondant.

40:45.291 --> 40:46.250
-Fondant.
-Yes.

40:46.875 --> 40:49.666
Gentlemen. I have three rules.

40:50.166 --> 40:53.458
Rule Number One, this is my kitchen.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.833
Rule Number Two, this is my kitchen.

40:56.916 --> 41:01.375
Once you register those rules
into your thinking stations,

41:01.458 --> 41:04.125
then you'll register Rule Number Three.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.708
Do as I say.

41:06.208 --> 41:07.375
Are we clear?

41:08.083 --> 41:09.250
Silence!

41:10.708 --> 41:11.583
This is serious now.

41:12.166 --> 41:13.208
Serious.

41:14.291 --> 41:16.583
-What…

41:17.916 --> 41:19.208
Get to work!

41:20.708 --> 41:22.708
-Hey, ladies.
-Hi.

41:22.791 --> 41:25.500
I just wanted to see
if you girls are okay.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.208
I think we're good. Thank you.

41:28.541 --> 41:31.125
That top really looks nice on you.

41:31.208 --> 41:32.333
Where did you get it?

41:32.958 --> 41:34.416
It was a gift from Richard.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.125
Aw, that's so sweet of him.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.333
So, what is he like?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.875
He's brilliant. He's funny and insightful.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.625
He's decent.

41:48.708 --> 41:50.208
He looks like it.

41:50.291 --> 41:53.208
I mean, he is not like the guys
that I am used to meeting in my life.

41:53.291 --> 41:56.791
He has some affinity to him, you know?

41:58.166 --> 42:00.833
Maybe we should just,
you know, continue here.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.958
Okay, um, if you need anything,
just let me know.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.541
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.041
You know, Khalid,

42:11.708 --> 42:13.166
my dad used to tell me,

42:14.250 --> 42:15.333
"Richard,

42:16.291 --> 42:19.416
as a man you must understand,

42:19.916 --> 42:22.125
that you can never understand women.

42:22.875 --> 42:25.000
There are only three things
you can tell them.

42:25.625 --> 42:26.708
'You are right,'

42:27.208 --> 42:28.125
'I love you,'

42:28.625 --> 42:31.166
'And I'm so sorry babe.'"

42:31.666 --> 42:33.166
What a bunch of BS.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.875
That man was so wrong.

42:35.375 --> 42:38.833
Hey, chill bro. You sound like
you're digging for buried treasure.

42:39.750 --> 42:42.125
That's because he is
when he shouldn't be. You see,

42:42.208 --> 42:43.958
the real understanding of a woman,

42:44.041 --> 42:47.125
comes from accepting
the fact that she is human.

42:47.208 --> 42:50.083
And is allowed to make mistakes, changes,

42:50.875 --> 42:52.916
and decisions for herself.

42:53.000 --> 42:53.958
So what?

42:54.458 --> 42:58.500
So instead of you trying
to figure her out in order to fix her,

42:59.416 --> 43:03.083
you need to allow her to
feel accepted and supported.

43:03.666 --> 43:06.166
Once we show her
that kind of support and love,

43:06.250 --> 43:09.041
it empowers her to become her true self.

43:10.250 --> 43:11.541
And give love at the same way.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.375
You know, those are very wise words,

43:14.458 --> 43:17.583
but they're coming from a man
with very crude character.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.041
By pointing that finger at me,

43:19.125 --> 43:21.291
look how many fingers
are pointing back at you.

43:40.625 --> 43:41.541
Babe.

43:42.375 --> 43:45.416
I think I just had a rude awakening.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.708
-Oh my God!
-Baby--

43:48.791 --> 43:50.708
Maybe I've been looking through

43:50.791 --> 43:53.250
the wrong lens and it can be haunting.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.041
It can be haunting, you know.

43:55.125 --> 43:56.833
Can you just hold on to that thought?

43:56.916 --> 43:58.541
And it's so messed up the way

43:58.625 --> 44:01.250
I always want to be right
about every single fucking thing,

44:01.333 --> 44:04.083
when really all I should care
about is what's true.

44:04.166 --> 44:05.750
Baby, can you just
give me three minutes of--

44:05.833 --> 44:07.166
And babe, babe, babe,

44:07.250 --> 44:09.791
I am so one-sided on a whole lot of topics

44:09.875 --> 44:11.041
And I think that it's time--

44:11.125 --> 44:12.375
Richard!

44:13.250 --> 44:15.958
I have to yell so that you can listen?

44:16.041 --> 44:17.875
God, it's so annoying.

44:17.958 --> 44:21.125
Now, I have to start over
cause I'm not fucking calm.

44:22.666 --> 44:25.416
Either you shut the fuck up
or you fuck off.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.583
I never pegged you
to be one to sit at a bar.

44:59.666 --> 45:02.500
Jeez. Jesus, you scared me.

45:02.583 --> 45:04.625
Oh, my bad.

45:05.958 --> 45:06.875
Am I that hideous?

45:08.375 --> 45:09.833
Gin and tonic, please.

45:10.750 --> 45:11.833
What do you have there?

45:13.041 --> 45:16.708
Soda. I am not a fan of alcohol.

45:19.458 --> 45:21.750
Actually, I think
I'll have a <i>moscato</i> instead.

45:21.833 --> 45:23.333
<i>Moscato?</i>

45:24.000 --> 45:25.375
-Mosquito juice?

45:26.000 --> 45:27.833
No, a <i>moscato</i>.

45:29.166 --> 45:32.041
It's a fizzy sweet drink,

45:32.125 --> 45:34.375
usually rosé or white wine.

45:35.416 --> 45:38.625
Celine thinks it's a boring drink.

45:40.625 --> 45:42.291
I mean, I'd offer you a sip,

45:43.000 --> 45:44.666
but I'm going to respect your decision.

45:48.125 --> 45:51.083
Oh, I thought
you said you weren't a fan.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.583
This is definitely not a boring drink.

45:55.666 --> 45:57.208
-Yeah?

45:59.625 --> 46:01.375
-Oh.

46:02.375 --> 46:03.375
Okay.

46:06.416 --> 46:09.500
I think I'm going through
a phase or something.

46:12.416 --> 46:14.208
Oh.

46:15.625 --> 46:16.541
Okay.

46:22.541 --> 46:25.291
So you're taking
the fourth, what?

46:29.291 --> 46:30.666
Your eyes…

46:31.708 --> 46:33.166
they are very intense.

46:38.208 --> 46:39.666
I'm going to the beach for a walk.

46:40.625 --> 46:41.583
You wanna come?

46:44.958 --> 46:47.708
Such a beautiful evening.
I really love beach walks.

46:48.541 --> 46:50.291
They are even better
if you have good company.

46:52.750 --> 46:56.583
You know, I thought I had good company.

46:58.166 --> 46:59.500
I was replaced.

47:00.166 --> 47:01.833
I found him in the arms of another woman.

47:03.250 --> 47:04.541
You didn't deserve that.

47:05.541 --> 47:08.375
No listen, you didn't deserve that, Judy.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.375
This world can be a cruel
and nasty place sometimes,

47:13.458 --> 47:15.500
but the things people do to us,

47:16.166 --> 47:18.000
they are not a reflection of who we are.

47:19.208 --> 47:20.666
I need you to remember that.

47:21.625 --> 47:22.833
Hey.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.083
-Hello.
-Hi. Is Otis and the team here?

48:34.583 --> 48:36.041
Yes.

48:36.125 --> 48:37.583
-Welcome. Come.
-Thank you.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.000
Excuse me.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.625
-Sorry.
-Do you know where the restaurant is?

48:41.708 --> 48:42.583
Oh, the restaurant? Okay.

48:42.666 --> 48:45.916
Straight ahead, then take a left.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.083
Pass the swimming pool on your right.

48:49.166 --> 48:51.250
From there, it's easy to find it.

48:51.333 --> 48:54.625
Follow the signs.

48:54.708 --> 48:55.625
Thank you. Bye.

48:55.708 --> 48:57.625
You look beautiful.

48:58.875 --> 49:01.458
Come on, let's go.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.708
It's not far.

49:06.833 --> 49:09.166
I have asked for it…

49:21.000 --> 49:22.208
TK!

49:22.708 --> 49:23.708
Hi.

49:24.625 --> 49:26.333
Hi. Welcome.

49:27.458 --> 49:28.583
What's wrong?

49:30.250 --> 49:32.875
You guys are mad.

49:36.625 --> 49:37.916
TK, what's wrong?

49:40.416 --> 49:41.833
What's wrong?

51:31.416 --> 51:34.875
Ah, TK. You are here!

51:34.958 --> 51:37.791
-Are you happy to see me?
-Oh, yes I am!

51:38.458 --> 51:40.166
What did you want
to borrow from me this time?

51:40.250 --> 51:42.500
Ah, come on, what's that supposed to mean?

51:42.583 --> 51:44.000
Otis, have you ordered the cake?

51:44.583 --> 51:46.250
Yes, I did. Fondle.

51:46.333 --> 51:48.458
-Fondle my tits?
-Oh yes.

51:48.541 --> 51:50.083
A fondant cake?

51:50.166 --> 51:52.208
What the fuck?!
What's wrong with the butter one?

51:52.291 --> 51:53.916
The fondant is like eating plastic.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.333
I'd rather the latter.

51:56.791 --> 51:58.708
We need to give it an element of class.

51:58.791 --> 52:00.625
These <i>Naijos</i> think we are like, backward.

52:00.708 --> 52:02.583
-Like we're just all about the foreheads.
-Yeah!

52:02.666 --> 52:03.875
East African foreheads.

52:03.958 --> 52:05.333
-Yes!
-We are about class.

52:05.416 --> 52:06.333
-Class!
-Okay!

52:06.416 --> 52:08.416
Well, you already have the ass
just show them the C-L.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.583
-Okay.
-Oh.

52:19.708 --> 52:22.333
Welcome to The Cave.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.791
Here's a toast to every single one of you,

52:25.875 --> 52:27.583
for making all this a possibility.

52:28.666 --> 52:29.875
I wouldn't…

52:30.708 --> 52:33.250
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys. So, thank you.

52:33.333 --> 52:36.916
Thank you so much for coming through.
TK, for your last-minute save,

52:37.000 --> 52:38.333
thank you so much.

52:38.833 --> 52:40.083
My man,

52:41.208 --> 52:42.875
for your leadership.

52:43.833 --> 52:44.875
Cheers.

52:45.375 --> 52:48.250
Here. To teamwork,

52:48.333 --> 52:50.291
and solid friendships,

52:50.833 --> 52:52.458
and loyalty…

52:53.041 --> 52:55.666
Loyalty!

52:55.750 --> 52:57.833
Baby, it's okay.

52:58.500 --> 53:00.750
Just relax today. It's done.

53:06.583 --> 53:07.666
Cheers.

53:22.125 --> 53:24.333
Okay. Let us eat.

53:29.166 --> 53:32.916
Judy just needs to break up
with Erastus 'cause first of all,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.083
what kind of name is Erastus?

53:35.583 --> 53:37.500
He's always putting her down.

53:38.625 --> 53:41.708
The only thing
that he does have is the audacity.

53:46.041 --> 53:47.125
Baby?

53:57.500 --> 53:58.791
Richard look,

54:00.208 --> 54:03.958
I know that we haven't exactly
had the smoothest time.

54:05.708 --> 54:07.875
That's why I've been doing some thinking.

54:10.375 --> 54:15.166
And I'm sorry that I haven't been
the easiest person to deal with.

54:18.041 --> 54:20.416
Baby, I need you to know that I love you.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.375
And that I know we can make this work.

54:28.958 --> 54:30.458
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

54:31.041 --> 54:32.250
Yeah.

54:58.291 --> 54:59.208
-Abeo.
-Eh?

55:00.416 --> 55:01.916
-Please…
-Yeah.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.166
Don't we have, eh,
beach resorts in Lagos?

55:06.666 --> 55:08.500
Eh, so why did we have
to come all this way?

55:08.583 --> 55:11.416
Don't you want to see
the legendary women of Kenya?

55:12.208 --> 55:14.583
I hear they cure prostate cancer.

55:15.250 --> 55:17.291
Who told you that?

55:17.375 --> 55:19.458
-Me!
-Who told you that?

55:19.541 --> 55:20.958
Who told you that?

55:22.666 --> 55:24.958
What are
you two going on about?

55:25.041 --> 55:28.333
Your balls shrunk a long time ago.

55:28.416 --> 55:29.708
Shh! That's enough!

55:29.791 --> 55:31.625
-Ah. Bedroom talk!

55:37.541 --> 55:39.000
Dele, Dele, Dele.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.875
My guy, you guy.

55:40.958 --> 55:42.791
How was your flight?

55:42.875 --> 55:44.708
It was long but comfortable.

55:44.791 --> 55:46.583
Eh, the flight to your wedding
must be comfortable.

55:46.666 --> 55:48.000
-Rita.
-Hello.

55:48.083 --> 55:50.041
I can't thank you so much
for trusting me with your wedding.

55:50.125 --> 55:52.791
You're welcome. And I can't wait
to see the beautiful decorations.

55:52.875 --> 55:54.708
Oh, you will love it. Mwah!

55:54.791 --> 55:56.833
-This is TK.
-Hi, TK.

55:56.916 --> 55:58.750
I want to see
what you have done. Right now.

55:58.833 --> 56:01.083
Of course, Aunty. Please. Welcome.

56:01.166 --> 56:02.125
Welcome.

56:12.250 --> 56:13.458
And here,

56:13.541 --> 56:17.541
ladies and gentlemen,
is where creativity meets elegance.

56:17.625 --> 56:21.500
An outdoor experience is exactly
what this reception needs.

56:22.208 --> 56:24.708
-What is it?

56:24.791 --> 56:27.541
Otis, when I asked you
if you could do a Yoruba wedding,

56:27.625 --> 56:29.291
-what did you say?
-I said I could do it.

56:30.375 --> 56:32.333
Does this look
like a Yoruba wedding to you?

56:32.916 --> 56:35.375
What village idiots do you take us for?

56:36.125 --> 56:39.500
Babe! What happened
to the the message I sent to you?

56:39.583 --> 56:41.541
What message?

56:41.625 --> 56:46.000
I sent you an email with
detailed instructions over a month ago.

56:46.083 --> 56:48.625
Otis, I didn't pay you money,

56:48.708 --> 56:50.916
to do a rubbish white wedding.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.291
I mean, what is this?

56:52.375 --> 56:54.708
No, tell me. What is this?

56:54.791 --> 56:55.666
-Dele!
-What is this?

56:55.750 --> 56:57.791
Guy, guy…

56:57.875 --> 56:59.541
No tell me! Otis,

57:00.541 --> 57:02.916
if my wedding turns out to be a fiasco,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.541
not a single penny of mine
will be invested in your company.

57:06.291 --> 57:09.708
Your son's temper is very questionable.

57:09.791 --> 57:13.166
Very questionable. No,
I am concerned for Rita's safety.

57:13.250 --> 57:15.833
What can I do to make it better? Rita.

57:15.916 --> 57:18.750
-Rita, what do I do?
-A lot. A lot! A whole lot!

57:18.833 --> 57:19.708
Everything!

57:19.791 --> 57:21.875
-Was it not your wife and daughter…
-Mm-hmm.

57:22.416 --> 57:24.625
…who almost kicked
airport security this morning?

57:25.708 --> 57:28.083
I should be concerned
for your son's safety.

57:29.208 --> 57:30.375
Greetings, everyone.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.416
Excuse me!

58:34.250 --> 58:35.291
Hello!

58:35.833 --> 58:37.000
She's not answering.

58:37.666 --> 58:38.958
Excuse me!

58:40.750 --> 58:41.708
Hello?

58:42.250 --> 58:44.541
-Me?
-Yeah, you. Who else?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.833
You're the planner we met earlier, right?

58:47.916 --> 58:49.500
You're the one responsible for this mess?

58:49.583 --> 58:50.958
Why won't you fix it?

58:51.041 --> 58:53.041
What is wrong with you people?

58:53.125 --> 58:54.625
Why are you so slow?

58:57.875 --> 59:00.250
You know, a wise man once told me,

59:00.333 --> 59:02.875
you are the reflection
of the insults you throw at people.

59:02.958 --> 59:05.708
Listen lady,

59:05.791 --> 59:08.166
I read my palms today.

59:08.250 --> 59:12.541
I read my palms today.
It said I'm going to slap someone today.

59:12.625 --> 59:14.291
-She's the one I will slap. I'll slap you.
-You'll slap who?

59:14.375 --> 59:16.875
-I'm going to slap you.
-You'll slap who?Are you mad?

59:16.958 --> 59:18.958
-No problem. It's you I will slap you.
-Are you mad?

59:19.041 --> 59:19.916
Are you…

59:20.000 --> 59:21.791
What
n the Nollywood shit is this?

59:21.875 --> 59:22.875
Are you mad?

59:22.958 --> 59:25.750
Come back, Patience Ozokwor.
Come!

59:48.958 --> 59:50.166
Oh, TK…

59:51.291 --> 59:52.458
What did you call me?

59:53.625 --> 59:54.875
Kate?

1:00:02.125 --> 1:00:04.916
Oh, TK.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:18.750
Get out.

1:00:32.833 --> 1:00:34.083
Excuse me.

1:00:34.166 --> 1:00:35.791
Fuck!

1:00:36.583 --> 1:00:38.250
What? What is this?

1:00:38.333 --> 1:00:40.333
-It's a destination.
-Really?

1:00:40.416 --> 1:00:41.791
Look, the place is a destination.

1:00:41.875 --> 1:00:43.791
-It's a destination wedding.
-Hey, hey.

1:00:43.875 --> 1:00:44.708
-Look. Look!
-Otis.

1:00:44.791 --> 1:00:46.625
Destination. Wedding.

1:00:46.708 --> 1:00:48.375
What the fuck is a Yoruba wedding?

1:00:48.458 --> 1:00:51.083
Ah TK, what the fuck
is a Yoruba wedding, tell me?

1:00:51.166 --> 1:00:53.291
I swear to God, Rita is driving me mad!

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:55.958
-Otis--
-No, listen . I don't care.

1:00:56.041 --> 1:00:58.708
I don't care. What the fuck
is a Yoruba wedding? At this point,

1:00:58.791 --> 1:01:00.750
I just want Rita to f…

1:01:07.083 --> 1:01:08.208
What were you going to say?

1:01:08.291 --> 1:01:09.958
-Huh?
-Eh?

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.375
What was it you wanted to say?

1:01:16.750 --> 1:01:19.166
-What was it you wanted to say?
-Rita…

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:21.500
-You see at this point,
-Eh?

1:01:21.583 --> 1:01:23.333
I want you to forget

1:01:23.416 --> 1:01:25.708
-Forget?
-about the fuss that is going on.

1:01:25.791 --> 1:01:28.375
And concentrate with the fuss with Dele.

1:01:29.416 --> 1:01:30.541
That's it.

1:01:31.041 --> 1:01:32.166
What do you want me to do?

1:01:32.250 --> 1:01:33.458
To the kitchen with the men.

1:01:35.041 --> 1:01:36.083
Men, why?

1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:40.041
-Why?
-Otis!

1:01:45.541 --> 1:01:46.750
Rubbish!

1:01:47.625 --> 1:01:49.125
<i>You silly cook!</i>

1:01:49.208 --> 1:01:51.291
<i>Come, you must cook</i>
<i>this food the way I want it.</i>

1:01:51.375 --> 1:01:53.208
Better keep listening to me,

1:01:53.291 --> 1:01:54.500
didn't I…

1:01:54.583 --> 1:01:55.875
If I cook it, one day I will break you.

1:01:55.958 --> 1:01:57.875
-I will break you!
-Get out of my kitchen!

1:01:57.958 --> 1:01:59.416
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:01.750
Look, don't butt
heads roughly with me. I will break you!

1:02:01.833 --> 1:02:03.500
-I will lock you up.
-I'll burn your face.

1:02:03.583 --> 1:02:04.791
Take a good look at me, you animal!

1:02:04.875 --> 1:02:06.041
Look at me!

1:02:06.125 --> 1:02:07.041
Are you all witnessing this?

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:09.125
When I deal with him, eh!
When I deal with him!

1:02:09.208 --> 1:02:10.833
You must cook it! Don't you know…

1:02:10.916 --> 1:02:13.458
Why did you remove the block of knives?

1:02:14.083 --> 1:02:15.125
Years ago,

1:02:16.208 --> 1:02:20.541
my mother had problems with the way
that Ini was raising our child.

1:02:21.208 --> 1:02:22.708
When my wife had had enough,

1:02:23.208 --> 1:02:26.125
she chased my mother
out of the house, with a knife!

1:02:26.208 --> 1:02:27.458
-No!
-Ah-ah.

1:02:28.416 --> 1:02:29.916
-She's that dangerous?
-Oh.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.333
Why are you still married to her?

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:34.208
Abeo!

1:02:34.291 --> 1:02:36.083
The streets of Lagos are very dangerous.

1:02:37.041 --> 1:02:38.916
You see what I'm saying!

1:02:39.750 --> 1:02:40.583
Go.

1:02:40.666 --> 1:02:41.958
-Okay, what do we do?
-Do you understand?

1:02:42.041 --> 1:02:44.625
-I will deal with you.
-We are all friends.

1:02:44.708 --> 1:02:47.166
Come on, Chef, we are going
to have to change the menu.

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:48.708
We also got the information very late.

1:02:49.291 --> 1:02:51.166
Bro, I don't have any problem with that.

1:02:51.916 --> 1:02:53.583
I just don't appreciate

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:57.000
being spoken to in that manner,
especially in my kitchen.

1:03:00.375 --> 1:03:03.541
We're going to need him
if we're going to make this work.

1:03:08.583 --> 1:03:10.875
And now, gentlemen,

1:03:11.625 --> 1:03:15.375
this is my first item on <i>my</i> menu.

1:03:20.916 --> 1:03:22.333
Allah,
protect me from this absurdity.

1:03:22.416 --> 1:03:23.375
What's in it?

1:03:33.708 --> 1:03:36.416
What's crack-a-lackin'? How ya'll doing?

1:03:38.333 --> 1:03:39.208
What?

1:03:41.041 --> 1:03:41.958
What?

1:03:46.708 --> 1:03:47.833
What?

1:03:51.208 --> 1:03:54.333
Oh, no!

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:57.708
-Bro, stop.

1:03:58.666 --> 1:03:59.708
Get out!

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:09.875
No.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.375
-It's nice.

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:56.291
Guys, we just have a few hours
to transform this into a Yoruba wedding,

1:04:56.375 --> 1:04:59.000
so I found some photos. So Judy, Celine,

1:04:59.083 --> 1:05:02.250
you set up this area
to become a reception area.

1:05:02.333 --> 1:05:03.416
That will also give you time to talk.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000
You coming with me to the florist
and to the fabric store.

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:08.375
And the… shit!

1:05:08.458 --> 1:05:12.541
TK, we need
to talk about this buttercream cake.

1:05:13.416 --> 1:05:14.916
I think I'd rather a fondant cake.

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:17.458
Why would you want a fondant one,
what's wrong with the butter one?

1:05:17.541 --> 1:05:19.125
It's not elegant enough.

1:05:19.208 --> 1:05:20.458
What an idiot.

1:05:21.416 --> 1:05:23.625
Listen, I'll have a fondant cake

1:05:23.708 --> 1:05:25.125
and that's not up for debate.

1:05:25.208 --> 1:05:27.500
Rita trust me,
we are okay with what we have.

1:05:27.583 --> 1:05:29.000
TK, you will go to the shop,

1:05:29.083 --> 1:05:31.833
and you'll order a fondant cake.

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:33.166
And that's final.

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:35.166
Listen, you're more than
welcome to go do it yourself.

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:36.916
I'm doing Otis a favor.

1:05:37.791 --> 1:05:39.625
I could be doing something else
like lounging on the beach

1:05:39.708 --> 1:05:41.458
and yet I'm here helping you.

1:05:41.541 --> 1:05:45.208
Oh, and FYI, it takes two to three days
to bake and decorate a fondant cake.

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:46.708
Good luck with that.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:47.833
Leave me alone!

1:05:50.666 --> 1:05:51.625
Fine.

1:05:52.416 --> 1:05:54.333
-We'll have it your way then.
-Yeah.

1:05:54.916 --> 1:05:57.083
Fondle, fondle, what am I fondling here?

1:05:57.166 --> 1:05:59.958
You think I have nothing better to do?

1:06:00.541 --> 1:06:01.708
Don't bore me!

1:06:02.916 --> 1:06:06.583
You go eat, you carry
some <i>fufu</i> and go eat there, shut up!

1:06:06.666 --> 1:06:09.833
I am so sick and tired of these Nigerians.
I have had enough. I just wanna…

1:06:10.666 --> 1:06:13.041
Speak of the devil, here they come.

1:06:14.833 --> 1:06:16.875
-Where's Otis?
-He's here.

1:06:18.416 --> 1:06:21.875
Didn't he send you guys text messages
or emails about the changes?

1:06:24.541 --> 1:06:27.375
-What changes?
-We were meant to have a Yoruba wedding.

1:06:28.125 --> 1:06:29.708
I can't believe
that idiot forgot to mention it.

1:06:29.791 --> 1:06:31.833
Who are you calling an idiot?

1:06:35.833 --> 1:06:39.125
Are these the people
you entrusted your wedding with?

1:06:39.208 --> 1:06:41.291
Hold this for me. This lady's
always rubbing my shoulder the wrong way.

1:06:41.375 --> 1:06:43.666
Let me tell you, I will beat you up

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:46.333
till you won't remember if you gave birth
to this girl or you farted her. You!

1:06:46.416 --> 1:06:48.916
Our people are great at being nice,

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.333
-gentle and respectful to other people.
-Mm-hmm.

1:06:52.291 --> 1:06:55.666
It makes you wonder
what it is they are not great at.

1:06:55.750 --> 1:06:58.750
Well, being nice, gentle and respectful,

1:06:58.833 --> 1:06:59.833
to other people.

1:07:01.375 --> 1:07:02.416
-Abeo.

1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:03.833
Who's your friend?

1:07:03.916 --> 1:07:05.541
-You're also a hacker!
-"Yahoo!"

1:07:05.625 --> 1:07:06.750
-You're also a hacker!
-"Yahoo!"

1:07:06.833 --> 1:07:07.750
-You're also a hacker!
-"Yahoo!"

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:09.291
-You're also a hacker!
-"Yahoo!"

1:07:09.375 --> 1:07:11.500
Yahoo hackers, hackers of emotions.

1:07:11.583 --> 1:07:13.541
Get a canoe
and go to Enugu and do it there.

1:07:13.625 --> 1:07:14.458
Nonsense!

1:07:15.208 --> 1:07:16.458
To hell with these goons!

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.458
So how many are these in a dozen?

1:07:24.541 --> 1:07:25.500
Maybe six.

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:29.125
Oh, six? Oh, okay. And then maybe
we'll get a bouquet like this one.

1:07:29.208 --> 1:07:31.000
And then, we add this.

1:07:36.041 --> 1:07:36.875
Kagwe!

1:08:14.583 --> 1:08:15.875
Okay.

1:08:15.958 --> 1:08:17.458
Yeah.

1:08:21.833 --> 1:08:22.666
Woo-hoo! You are a vibe!

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:26.666
I can't take all the credit.
You have some moves.

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:28.500
Old school but, still, good moves.

1:08:28.583 --> 1:08:31.708
A note of appreciation
from the lady over here.

1:08:31.791 --> 1:08:34.916
You, my dear, are a dancer.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.416
-Stop.
-I will not stop. Make me.

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:40.750
Make me stop and make…

1:08:44.666 --> 1:08:46.916
We have… we have to go.

1:09:37.041 --> 1:09:38.458
Is everything okay?

1:09:41.333 --> 1:09:43.208
Oh shit,

1:09:43.291 --> 1:09:44.791
that doesn't look good.

1:09:44.875 --> 1:09:45.791
You don't say.

1:09:46.541 --> 1:09:47.791
Do you need any help?

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.166
I can manage myself.

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:53.083
Yo man, I have two hands.
The more the merrier.

1:09:54.666 --> 1:09:55.875
Okay.

1:09:57.500 --> 1:10:00.000
Let's have a look with what
we're working here with.

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:02.083
Hmm.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.833
It's actually harder than it looks.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:12.750
Let's make it softer. Yeah.

1:10:16.250 --> 1:10:18.000
I like the way you think sometimes,

1:10:18.083 --> 1:10:19.166
lubricate it as much as you can.

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:20.875
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:10:21.583 --> 1:10:22.458
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1:10:23.250 --> 1:10:26.625
-Yes?
-Yes.

1:10:27.125 --> 1:10:29.541
-It's going up. Yes!
-Yes!

1:10:29.625 --> 1:10:30.666
Yes!

1:10:34.541 --> 1:10:35.791
Oh, yes.

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:39.541
Oh, don't mind me.

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:42.333
I'm all for equal rights for everyone.

1:10:43.625 --> 1:10:45.583
Equal… No, no, it was…

1:10:51.833 --> 1:10:52.916
-Good job, Dele.
-Hmm.

1:10:57.500 --> 1:10:58.375
-Question.
-Yeah?

1:10:58.458 --> 1:11:00.375
-Do you play golf?
-Of course.

1:11:01.416 --> 1:11:02.708
I found a golf course around here.

1:11:02.791 --> 1:11:05.041
Let's go, hit some balls.

1:11:08.708 --> 1:11:10.041
I have to help out in the kitchen.

1:11:10.625 --> 1:11:12.833
Ah, forget the kitchen.
I'm sure they can do without you.

1:11:14.166 --> 1:11:15.416
Come on, let's go.

1:11:29.541 --> 1:11:30.541
Celine…

1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:35.500
Celine, I have a confession.

1:11:36.375 --> 1:11:37.458
Um…

1:11:38.791 --> 1:11:40.041
Judy and I…

1:11:41.750 --> 1:11:43.000
Fuck.

1:11:45.958 --> 1:11:47.041
Celine…

1:11:47.541 --> 1:11:49.000
we need to talk…

1:11:49.083 --> 1:11:51.958
Fuck! Who the fuck says,
"We need to talk."?

1:11:54.125 --> 1:11:55.375
Celine.

1:11:56.875 --> 1:12:00.208
I just realized that you and I
have never been on a beach together.

1:12:00.291 --> 1:12:02.041
So, do you wanna go for a walk?

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.375
Um… Listen, Celine.

1:12:05.458 --> 1:12:07.708
There's something you should know.

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:11.000
And it's going to kill me
if I stay quiet about it.

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:12.333
Okay.

1:12:12.416 --> 1:12:14.708
In the last few days, I've realized that,

1:12:15.583 --> 1:12:17.666
I haven't been the person
that you need me to be.

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:20.541
Maybe both of us
just haven't been in the right--

1:12:20.625 --> 1:12:22.125
No, listen.

1:12:22.208 --> 1:12:25.666
If we're both going to evolve
in this relationship together,

1:12:27.041 --> 1:12:28.458
then there's something you must know.

1:12:29.125 --> 1:12:30.250
What is it?

1:12:30.958 --> 1:12:31.958
Baby…

1:12:32.458 --> 1:12:33.333
I…

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:35.708
I want you to have my last name.

1:12:36.625 --> 1:12:39.791
Are you asking me
what I think you're asking me?

1:12:42.083 --> 1:12:45.041
-Celine Kariuki…
-Yes?

1:12:45.750 --> 1:12:46.583
Will you marry me?

1:12:46.666 --> 1:12:48.625
Yes!

1:13:33.250 --> 1:13:34.458
Listen, Khalid.

1:13:35.166 --> 1:13:37.750
I may come across as someone
who beats around the bush,

1:13:37.833 --> 1:13:40.833
but I only did that to protect myself
from people who are out to get my money.

1:13:44.791 --> 1:13:46.500
I guess you have your reasons.

1:13:48.375 --> 1:13:51.625
Am I making
the right decision investing in Otis?

1:13:51.708 --> 1:13:54.833
If I were you,
I wouldn't drop a single dime.

1:13:56.333 --> 1:13:57.833
Two years ago, maybe.

1:13:58.791 --> 1:14:00.750
Right now, the economy is shitty,

1:14:00.833 --> 1:14:03.125
and even though Janta Linux connects the

1:14:03.208 --> 1:14:05.125
unemployed to the employer,

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:06.791
there's really no ROI for you.

1:14:08.458 --> 1:14:12.375
Our clientele, the employers
are either paying peanuts or nothing.

1:14:19.375 --> 1:14:20.583
Why are you telling me this?

1:14:22.166 --> 1:14:24.375
Because I don't like
to beat around the bush.

1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:27.166
I have a proposal for you.

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:35.000
For a year, I have been
creating data clouds for small businesses.

1:14:35.083 --> 1:14:38.708
One of my clients has
great connections with government and

1:14:38.791 --> 1:14:42.208
I need money
to hire engineers to help expand.

1:14:42.708 --> 1:14:43.583
Right?

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:54.583
Hey.

1:14:57.541 --> 1:14:59.583
I said, hey.

1:15:01.291 --> 1:15:03.625
TK, we need to talk about yesterday.

1:15:06.750 --> 1:15:09.791
After a situation like that,
we need to talk about it.

1:15:09.875 --> 1:15:11.916
What an idiotic DJ!
He should have just mentioned

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.291
that he was having issues with his visa.

1:15:14.958 --> 1:15:16.166
-Otis!
-Hey.

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:17.458
Kate!

1:15:18.541 --> 1:15:20.041
Otis.

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:23.000
I'm impressed you can remember my name.

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:23.916
How's the hangover?

1:15:24.541 --> 1:15:28.250
It's okay. I survived.
How do you guys know each other?

1:15:28.333 --> 1:15:30.125
Uh, she's my maid of honor.

1:15:30.208 --> 1:15:34.375
Listen Otis, um, my DJ can't make it.
Now I have to find a replacement.

1:15:34.458 --> 1:15:36.125
Uh, that's okay, I can DJ for you.

1:15:36.750 --> 1:15:37.791
You can?

1:15:38.291 --> 1:15:40.208
Thank you so much. That'll be amazing.

1:15:40.291 --> 1:15:42.916
So I have some equipment
coming in in like ten minutes.

1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:46.333
-So you can--
-You, DJing. How?

1:15:49.166 --> 1:15:50.083
What can I do to help?

1:15:50.958 --> 1:15:53.083
Thank you. You're a rock star.
Please um, let's

1:15:53.166 --> 1:15:55.833
You don't even have
a DJ controller. You don't have that.

1:15:55.916 --> 1:15:58.000
I can use an app, okay?

1:15:58.083 --> 1:15:59.208
You had uh, equipment.

1:15:59.291 --> 1:16:01.000
-Yeah, thank you. You are a rock star.
-Okay, just send me

1:16:01.083 --> 1:16:04.291
playlists, songs, something to play
around with and then I'll…

1:16:04.375 --> 1:16:05.625
we'll see what we can do.

1:16:16.625 --> 1:16:18.458
-Yo.
-Hey.

1:16:18.541 --> 1:16:22.000
Congratulations bruv,
you two are finally tying the knot.

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:25.000
Oh, uh… Yeah.

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:29.416
Yeah, thanks. Um, I finally decided

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.041
four years just seemed a bit too long.

1:16:32.458 --> 1:16:34.000
I respect your bravery.

1:16:36.125 --> 1:16:37.583
Wait, what?

1:16:38.833 --> 1:16:39.833
Why?

1:16:40.583 --> 1:16:41.916
Uh…

1:16:43.416 --> 1:16:45.916
You guy, it happened a very long time ago.

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:47.708
It probably doesn't matter now, okay?

1:16:47.791 --> 1:16:50.791
-You're getting married. Congratulations.
-Otis.

1:16:51.750 --> 1:16:53.708
Fuck, fuck.

1:16:57.208 --> 1:16:58.333
Out with it.

1:17:04.666 --> 1:17:05.750
Come on, just say it.

1:17:08.125 --> 1:17:11.208
Rita, you are so original,

1:17:11.291 --> 1:17:13.083
about having your traditional

1:17:13.166 --> 1:17:15.375
as a destination wedding over here.

1:17:15.458 --> 1:17:18.750
Get me a Kenyan man, so I can do the same.

1:17:18.833 --> 1:17:20.375
Well, good luck with that.

1:17:20.458 --> 1:17:21.583
Why would you say that?

1:17:21.666 --> 1:17:23.708
Finding a good Kenyan man is like,

1:17:23.791 --> 1:17:24.750
impossible.

1:17:25.250 --> 1:17:26.916
-No…
-Especially you, Otis.

1:17:27.625 --> 1:17:29.958
No. All of you had an opportunity.

1:17:30.041 --> 1:17:32.458
Our own Kenyan sisters are looking
for your Nigerian brothers.

1:17:32.541 --> 1:17:34.458
A Nigerian man will take you out,

1:17:34.541 --> 1:17:37.708
spoil you rotten
regardless of the money in his wallet.

1:17:37.791 --> 1:17:38.666
Yeah?

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:40.750
And, in between the sheets,

1:17:40.833 --> 1:17:44.833
Ooh! He will satisfy you
before he satisfies himself.

1:17:44.916 --> 1:17:46.416
Yeah, but we are telling you now.

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:48.166
-But you still call yourselves my friends?
-We're telling you now.

1:17:48.250 --> 1:17:49.333
-We are telling you now.
-Ah, come on man.

1:17:49.416 --> 1:17:51.625
-That was a long time ago.
-No. That doesn't explain it.

1:17:51.708 --> 1:17:53.916
That was a long time ago.

1:17:54.541 --> 1:17:56.333
-And your Kenyan men?
-Useless.

1:17:56.416 --> 1:17:57.250
Hmm?

1:17:57.333 --> 1:17:59.458
Celine. Celine!

1:18:01.833 --> 1:18:04.833
When were you planning
on telling me that you fucked Josh?

1:18:07.666 --> 1:18:09.000
When were you going to tell me?

1:18:11.666 --> 1:18:13.333
Baby, that was years ago.

1:18:13.416 --> 1:18:14.708
Don't give me that bullshit.

1:18:14.791 --> 1:18:18.500
We were together, you could have told me.
You had so many opportunities to tell me.

1:18:19.083 --> 1:18:21.583
It was a…
I was in a different point in my life…

1:18:21.666 --> 1:18:24.208
And I wasn't even sure
that I had feelings for Josh.

1:18:24.291 --> 1:18:27.000
Oh, so you decided to jump in the sheets
with him, to get your answer?

1:18:27.083 --> 1:18:28.083
Richard!

1:18:29.291 --> 1:18:31.083
And you know that Josh
and I were tight growing up.

1:18:31.166 --> 1:18:33.666
I know everyone knows about you and Josh.

1:18:33.750 --> 1:18:36.166
I am sick and tired of hearing about Josh.

1:18:36.958 --> 1:18:39.458
Why am I the last person
to know about this?

1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:47.166
And now I realize that was the only
reason you invited me to that dinner.

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:48.916
So that you could make him jealous.

1:18:50.041 --> 1:18:51.000
Right?

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:55.041
You never really liked me
in the first place.

1:18:58.541 --> 1:19:00.708
But in the end I chose you, right?

1:19:06.291 --> 1:19:10.208
This is why you can't be happy, Celine.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.750
Wasting our time with all this
bullshit therapy, when all this time,

1:19:17.833 --> 1:19:19.416
you've always been comparing me to Josh

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.666
but I will never be him.
Will I, Miss Spontaneous?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.958
More like Miss Indecisive to me.

1:19:30.916 --> 1:19:32.583
Hold it right there, Jesus.

1:19:33.750 --> 1:19:34.666
As if you have a leg to stand on.

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:35.708
What?

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:38.833
Lead by example, tell her. Tell her!

1:19:40.291 --> 1:19:42.041
I think you should chime in
on this conversation, Judy.

1:19:42.708 --> 1:19:43.958
Tell her!

1:19:44.041 --> 1:19:46.208
Wesley Pipes, you can't talk?

1:19:46.291 --> 1:19:48.333
Jada Fire, something you have to say?

1:19:48.958 --> 1:19:51.083
Bending each other over
on these Swahili balconies,

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:54.416
with each other's tongues in your throats.

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:57.791
Abeo.

1:19:57.875 --> 1:20:00.791
This eh, Twitter dating dramas,

1:20:00.875 --> 1:20:03.333
they're so much more interesting
than those eh, those couples

1:20:03.416 --> 1:20:06.333
that are always conflicting
themselves on Oprah.

1:20:07.291 --> 1:20:08.208
Ah-ah.

1:20:09.583 --> 1:20:12.333
What are you two gossips doing here?

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.291
They don't close the windows
properly around here anymore.

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:21.583
<i>Eddie Kwanza, bia o, bia o</i>

1:20:29.375 --> 1:20:30.916
Celine.

1:20:33.375 --> 1:20:34.708
Who are you preaching to?

1:21:26.791 --> 1:21:28.583
Ah, sorry. Sorry, guys.

1:21:28.666 --> 1:21:30.458
It's my daughter. Hey.

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:33.041
Hey Priya, I'll call you back.
Okay. Yes, yes. I love you.

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:34.208
I love you.

1:22:29.833 --> 1:22:31.500
I'm getting a Nigerian man.

1:22:31.583 --> 1:22:33.500
Shit!

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:35.541
Yo!

1:22:36.291 --> 1:22:38.375
Ah, you better? I'll hold you to it.

1:22:39.041 --> 1:22:40.416
Because shit!

1:22:41.583 --> 1:22:42.583
Eish!

1:22:43.083 --> 1:22:45.875
That's some shit. These guys don't play.

1:22:45.958 --> 1:22:47.708
Celine, can I talk to you?

1:22:51.125 --> 1:22:52.500
Celine, please.

1:22:53.666 --> 1:22:55.791
You've done a lot of talking
by saying nothing.

1:22:57.708 --> 1:23:00.166
Maybe things would've been
different if we'd have told her to tell--

1:23:00.250 --> 1:23:02.750
Judy, if you and Richard came clean.

1:23:05.208 --> 1:23:08.416
Maybe things would have been different
if we would have encouraged her

1:23:08.500 --> 1:23:11.250
to tell Richard the truth
about Josh four years ago.

1:23:35.166 --> 1:23:37.125
Seriously? Wow.

1:23:39.208 --> 1:23:40.375
What are you crying over?

1:23:41.333 --> 1:23:42.750
What the fuck?!

1:23:43.833 --> 1:23:45.833
Drink up, just like you do the boys.

1:23:50.958 --> 1:23:52.000
Hey, boss.

1:24:07.583 --> 1:24:08.708
Why are you DJing?

1:24:09.458 --> 1:24:11.833
Uh, standing in for Rita's DJ.

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:16.666
Yo, Khalid.

1:24:17.333 --> 1:24:20.208
I see you and uh, Dele

1:24:20.791 --> 1:24:22.375
getting a bit too close.

1:24:22.458 --> 1:24:23.708
Are you jealous?

1:24:24.291 --> 1:24:26.166
No.

1:24:26.666 --> 1:24:29.250
I'm just saying,
if you need any help closing the deal,

1:24:29.333 --> 1:24:30.750
look for me.

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:33.958
If he brings it up,
you'll be the first to know.

1:24:52.750 --> 1:24:54.166
Why are you not dancing?

1:24:54.958 --> 1:24:56.083
Um…

1:24:57.250 --> 1:24:59.916
Just not in the best of moods tonight.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.416
Well, that's the reason
why you need to dance.

1:25:03.625 --> 1:25:04.708
It will cheer you up.

1:25:05.250 --> 1:25:07.500
And I will enjoy seeing you.

1:25:14.583 --> 1:25:15.875
Thanks, but…

1:25:16.541 --> 1:25:17.541
I'm good.

1:25:26.750 --> 1:25:29.125
If I was a guest in this wedding,

1:25:29.875 --> 1:25:32.125
I would have grabbed you by your hand

1:25:32.625 --> 1:25:34.708
and took you to the dancing floor,

1:25:35.916 --> 1:25:37.875
and maybe to my room.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:39.791
I'm just saying.

1:25:46.041 --> 1:25:47.750
Listen, Nandi…

1:25:49.916 --> 1:25:50.750
I'm flattered.

1:25:51.833 --> 1:25:53.125
I really am but…

1:25:54.541 --> 1:25:57.416
you forget that I came here
with someone who I happen to love.

1:26:02.541 --> 1:26:03.916
She's important to me.

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:07.500
And I'd like to do right by her so…

1:26:08.875 --> 1:26:10.291
Let's just leave it at that.

1:26:12.958 --> 1:26:16.500
And besides
there's more than a few guys in there

1:26:16.583 --> 1:26:19.333
who are dying to mingle with you tonight.

1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000
Well, excuse me, guys.

1:27:31.083 --> 1:27:32.500
Yo, Dele!

1:27:32.583 --> 1:27:34.166
Hey, what's up, fam?

1:27:34.250 --> 1:27:36.875
When can you send the rest of the…

1:27:39.625 --> 1:27:42.083
Otis, today is my wedding day.

1:27:43.958 --> 1:27:45.125
You know what?

1:27:45.208 --> 1:27:47.083
I was going to save this for later but

1:27:47.166 --> 1:27:48.875
now is probably better.

1:27:50.833 --> 1:27:52.625
I will not be investing in your company.

1:27:52.708 --> 1:27:54.583
Wait, what?

1:27:55.666 --> 1:27:56.625
Why?

1:27:57.250 --> 1:27:59.000
I decided to go in another direction.

1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:02.166
Man, come on,
be straight with me. What's up?

1:28:02.250 --> 1:28:04.583
I saw the financials of your company and

1:28:04.666 --> 1:28:05.791
it doesn't look promising.

1:28:05.875 --> 1:28:08.416
It's a family business.
That's why we need your help.

1:28:08.500 --> 1:28:09.958
With your help, we can weather any storm.

1:28:10.041 --> 1:28:12.791
Is that what you meant when you said
my portfolio could be better?

1:28:12.875 --> 1:28:13.875
Come on, man,

1:28:13.958 --> 1:28:16.333
-I kept my end of the deal!
-Yes, you did!

1:28:16.875 --> 1:28:19.375
-But it was messy.
-Then fulfill your side of the deal too.

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.333
You know the beauty
of this is I'm not obligated to.

1:28:24.916 --> 1:28:26.208
We're done here.

1:28:26.291 --> 1:28:28.000
-Ah, no.
-Best of luck with everything.

1:28:28.083 --> 1:28:30.750
No, no. Stop this stupidity. Fuck you!

1:28:35.208 --> 1:28:37.208
Ten thousand Shillings says that they

1:28:37.291 --> 1:28:40.916
are about to take your son
for his honeymoon in an ambulance.

1:28:41.541 --> 1:28:43.125
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

1:28:43.208 --> 1:28:44.625
Fuck you!

1:28:44.708 --> 1:28:45.541
Hey, hey!

1:28:45.625 --> 1:28:47.041
-Fuck you!
-Hey!

1:28:47.125 --> 1:28:48.250
Hey, Otis!

1:28:48.333 --> 1:28:49.750
Leave him alone, Otis.

1:28:49.833 --> 1:28:51.375
Let him come at me.

1:28:51.458 --> 1:28:53.125
Ah, no. Come!

1:28:53.208 --> 1:28:54.833
Let go of him!

1:28:54.916 --> 1:28:55.916
Richard!

1:28:58.791 --> 1:29:00.208
What the hell, Otis?

1:29:03.291 --> 1:29:05.166
-I'll double it.
-Hmm?

1:29:05.250 --> 1:29:06.875
Dele will put him in the sea.

1:29:06.958 --> 1:29:08.166
Unusual.

1:29:08.250 --> 1:29:10.125
Did you not see
the right hook from the Kenyan?

1:29:12.291 --> 1:29:14.666
I will triple it.
Put your money where your mouth is.

1:29:14.750 --> 1:29:15.666
Ah-ah, this one?

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:16.666
This one? This one is not strong.

1:29:16.750 --> 1:29:18.666
This is "Rumble in Mombasa"
not "Rumble in the Jungle."

1:29:28.875 --> 1:29:31.000
I've always had bad anxiety.

1:29:38.416 --> 1:29:40.333
Nowadays they call it something fancy,

1:29:41.291 --> 1:29:43.708
ADHD.

1:29:45.250 --> 1:29:46.916
TK, I feel like I messed up everything.

1:29:52.541 --> 1:29:55.875
You haven't lost anything. You just look
at the world with the wrong lens.

1:29:57.166 --> 1:29:58.375
You still have your company.

1:29:59.208 --> 1:30:01.375
Khalid has proven he can lead, let him.

1:30:01.958 --> 1:30:03.875
And you have friends
that love you so much.

1:30:04.458 --> 1:30:07.416
So much so they flew across
the country to help you plan a wedding,

1:30:07.916 --> 1:30:09.541
despite us hating them all.

1:30:10.916 --> 1:30:14.208
And I mean you have a fair share
of women to be used when needed.

1:30:14.291 --> 1:30:18.541
Used! Again with that word, Jesus!

1:30:20.416 --> 1:30:21.708
I wonder why?

1:30:22.208 --> 1:30:24.250
Again, kicking a guy when he's down.

1:30:24.333 --> 1:30:25.250
You know what, Otis?

1:30:26.083 --> 1:30:28.916
You want to stand here
and feel sorry for yourself, be my guest.

1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.666
You know, I was doing just fine
standing here by myself.

1:30:32.750 --> 1:30:35.125
Okay? I didn't need your insights.

1:30:35.208 --> 1:30:37.833
You always rely on me
to come clean your mess. Always.

1:30:38.333 --> 1:30:40.750
And you never, ever
show me gratitude, Otis. Ever!

1:30:43.250 --> 1:30:46.208
And when I try to make myself
vulnerable to you, you…

1:30:49.291 --> 1:30:50.291
I, what?

1:30:55.958 --> 1:30:57.125
Never mind.

1:30:58.041 --> 1:30:59.625
What are you doing here, TK?

1:31:02.458 --> 1:31:05.250
Why are you helping me? To be used again?

1:31:06.333 --> 1:31:08.083
Cause this is what we do.

1:31:08.708 --> 1:31:11.625
You cry for help. I come to the rescue.

1:31:11.708 --> 1:31:13.833
-For what, Otis?
-Say it, for what?

1:31:13.916 --> 1:31:14.750
Don't tell me what to do, Otis.

1:31:14.833 --> 1:31:16.708
Then tell me what you want!

1:31:16.791 --> 1:31:17.625
You!

1:31:18.125 --> 1:31:20.083
Fuck! What is this shit?

1:31:21.625 --> 1:31:25.666
And why am I the only one pouring my heart
out if all it leads to is a dead end?

1:31:29.791 --> 1:31:31.125
What's all this for?

1:31:35.125 --> 1:31:37.750
You fall in love, I fall in love…

1:31:40.291 --> 1:31:42.541
We start speaking about forever…

1:31:43.708 --> 1:31:47.750
We start feeling those mushy,
fuzzy things inside and then--

1:31:47.833 --> 1:31:50.125
And then, what? What?

1:31:52.375 --> 1:31:53.875
Then we get bored.

1:31:54.458 --> 1:31:56.791
We start feeling fuzzy for someone else.

1:31:57.541 --> 1:31:58.916
And you know what happens?

1:32:02.458 --> 1:32:04.083
Another broken heart.

1:32:05.958 --> 1:32:08.541
Pretending that it doesn't hurt,
and because we're men,

1:32:08.625 --> 1:32:09.916
oh men don't feel any pain.

1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.625
You ladies can curl up
together, drink your wine,

1:32:12.708 --> 1:32:14.583
pour your feelings out. What do I do?

1:32:14.666 --> 1:32:16.333
Do I call my guys to drink whiskey?

1:32:16.416 --> 1:32:18.541
No, fuck that shit. Ah-ah.

1:32:21.041 --> 1:32:23.708
Well, I guess we are
just in different places in our lives.

1:32:25.083 --> 1:32:28.625
TK, don't blame me if I'm not
the guy that you hoped I would be.

1:32:29.750 --> 1:32:31.833
Why is it so hard for you to try?

1:32:32.333 --> 1:32:35.166
If I had known you'd be this scared,
Otis, I wouldn't have bothered.

1:32:35.250 --> 1:32:36.500
What's that supposed to mean?

1:32:36.583 --> 1:32:37.916
I don't know!

1:32:38.875 --> 1:32:40.166
I don't know.

1:32:42.041 --> 1:32:43.666
But what I do know…

1:32:44.708 --> 1:32:47.291
The fear that's in your eyes
right now, Otis…

1:32:47.833 --> 1:32:50.833
is the same fear
I saw the other day when I gambled

1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:52.750
and kissed you.

1:32:56.083 --> 1:32:58.541
Let's just pretend
nothing ever happened, ever.

1:33:44.041 --> 1:33:46.625
I'll send you the financials and…

1:33:46.708 --> 1:33:48.500
Please, take your time.

1:33:49.125 --> 1:33:50.166
Of course.

1:33:50.250 --> 1:33:52.416
Next time you are in Lagos,
let's play some golf.

1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:54.041
Absolutely.

1:33:54.125 --> 1:33:55.791
Thank you so much, guys. Bye.

1:33:55.875 --> 1:33:57.375
Bye.

1:33:59.916 --> 1:34:01.041
Look.

1:34:01.583 --> 1:34:03.666
I know it's none of my business,

1:34:03.750 --> 1:34:07.208
but I do think you and Otis
would make a really cute couple.

1:34:08.125 --> 1:34:11.250
There's a time I would have believed that
but there's just nothing there.

1:34:11.333 --> 1:34:15.250
Let me tell you,
there was a whole situation.

1:34:15.333 --> 1:34:16.625
Nothing happened,

1:34:17.125 --> 1:34:20.083
because he was literally saying
your name the entire time.

1:34:20.750 --> 1:34:22.958
But they're clearly feelings there.

1:34:32.791 --> 1:34:34.541
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:34:35.916 --> 1:34:36.833
What's up?

1:34:38.416 --> 1:34:40.333
Judy, I don't think I can do this.

1:34:41.333 --> 1:34:42.166
I hate flying.

1:34:43.583 --> 1:34:47.000
You know, it's funny how we all
just deal with different fears.

1:34:49.875 --> 1:34:51.958
Celine and Richard, they drove back?

1:34:52.458 --> 1:34:55.500
Okay, first of all, this isn't fear. Yeah?

1:34:56.166 --> 1:34:57.916
And yes, they did.

1:34:58.500 --> 1:34:59.666
It's hectic!

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:03.708
You know, we should
have all just chartered a flight.

1:35:04.416 --> 1:35:06.083
Hmm!

1:35:07.166 --> 1:35:10.708
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>can I have your attention?</i>

1:35:10.791 --> 1:35:13.416
-<i>Announcing the arrival of Flight</i>
-That's us.

1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:16.083
-Yeah.
<i>-Nine-zero-J-one-eight-six-zero-five…</i>

1:35:16.166 --> 1:35:18.416
<i>…boarding of passengers…</i>

1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:21.416
Okay so look,
I know it's none of my business but

1:35:21.500 --> 1:35:24.791
you and TK barely spoke
to each other after the second day.

1:35:24.875 --> 1:35:26.791
-What happened?

1:35:26.875 --> 1:35:29.833
She has some feelings,
and I don't know what I have.

1:35:32.833 --> 1:35:35.416
Wait, wait, wait.

1:35:36.875 --> 1:35:38.541
You're the guy she was rooting for?

1:35:39.125 --> 1:35:40.791
Wah, okay, now it all…

1:35:40.875 --> 1:35:41.833
Now, it all makes sense.

1:35:41.916 --> 1:35:43.125
What do you mean?

1:35:43.625 --> 1:35:44.708
The night before the trip,

1:35:45.583 --> 1:35:46.875
Um…

1:35:47.458 --> 1:35:51.500
the ladies night we, got high and,

1:35:52.125 --> 1:35:55.583
TK mentioned someone special.

1:35:56.375 --> 1:35:57.875
Dude, you got high? Wow.

1:35:58.666 --> 1:35:59.583
Wow.

1:35:59.666 --> 1:36:01.208
It's not like I planned it.

1:36:01.291 --> 1:36:04.000
I also didn't plan to fall in love.

1:36:08.291 --> 1:36:10.166
Okay. What if I do,

1:36:10.666 --> 1:36:11.916
and then it fails?

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.791
TK will never want me
to be a part of her life again. I can't.

1:36:16.833 --> 1:36:18.375
You have to give it a try.

1:36:18.458 --> 1:36:19.958
What if I fuck up?

1:36:21.791 --> 1:36:23.625
Then it will have been worth it.

1:36:24.583 --> 1:36:27.625
And if not, at least you get to fuck them.

1:36:27.708 --> 1:36:29.666
Oh my God! Judy!

1:36:31.125 --> 1:36:32.625
Alcohol!

1:37:08.833 --> 1:37:10.875
Uh Fiona, could you get me the, uh…

1:37:16.458 --> 1:37:17.291
Come in.

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:29.208
I came to…

1:37:30.291 --> 1:37:31.750
I came to say that,

1:37:33.958 --> 1:37:35.000
you were right.

1:37:37.333 --> 1:37:38.458
All along.

1:37:39.833 --> 1:37:42.250
My mother's company was dying and,

1:37:43.541 --> 1:37:45.208
I was scared.

1:37:46.458 --> 1:37:49.291
And instead
of pulling the trigger,

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:51.500
I used you,

1:37:52.708 --> 1:37:54.375
your sweat, your blood,

1:37:55.375 --> 1:37:57.500
and I dragged you into the unnecessary.

1:37:58.666 --> 1:37:59.791
I let you down.

1:38:02.291 --> 1:38:03.250
Thanks.

1:38:05.375 --> 1:38:06.458
Thank you, that…

1:38:07.375 --> 1:38:08.208
means a lot.

1:38:08.291 --> 1:38:09.291
Okay.

1:38:09.875 --> 1:38:12.625
You have somewhere you need to be?

1:38:13.625 --> 1:38:16.958
Yeah. Uh, unfortunately I…

1:38:17.750 --> 1:38:19.541
I have a flight to catch.

1:38:21.125 --> 1:38:23.916
I have an interview
with our dear friend Kimotho.

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.458
I could, uh…

1:38:31.458 --> 1:38:33.541
I could use you as a negotiator.

1:38:38.958 --> 1:38:40.208
I'm expensive.

1:38:42.791 --> 1:38:44.250
I know you messed up but,

1:38:45.583 --> 1:38:46.958
no one deserves Kimotho.

1:39:02.541 --> 1:39:03.875
Do you need any help?

1:39:03.958 --> 1:39:05.166
What are you doing here?

1:39:07.083 --> 1:39:08.833
I came…

1:39:10.750 --> 1:39:13.083
I came to say
that you were right about the cake.

1:39:14.333 --> 1:39:15.375
Is that all?

1:39:16.208 --> 1:39:18.250
I also came to say that I'm sorry.

1:39:18.958 --> 1:39:21.041
Sorry for being a dickhead to you.

1:39:22.625 --> 1:39:23.708
Go on.

1:39:28.750 --> 1:39:30.458
I'm also grateful.

1:39:33.208 --> 1:39:35.291
For everything that
you've done for me, ok.

1:39:36.375 --> 1:39:37.708
Go on Otis.

1:39:37.791 --> 1:39:39.666
Come on, TK man, I am trying.

1:39:40.166 --> 1:39:43.041
Okay, fine, I'll stop.

1:39:45.916 --> 1:39:47.666
It's all fun and games to you.

1:39:48.291 --> 1:39:52.208
I was doing just fine, then you show
up here ready drag me back to your shit.

1:39:54.791 --> 1:39:57.250
I was hoping we could make it our shit.

1:39:57.958 --> 1:40:00.166
It doesn't even sound
the way you want it to sound.

1:40:02.291 --> 1:40:03.666
If there's anyone who

1:40:03.750 --> 1:40:07.583
is more deserving of a
genuine loving relationship, it's you.

1:40:09.666 --> 1:40:12.833
If there's anyone I'm vulnerable with,

1:40:13.958 --> 1:40:15.416
it's also you.

1:40:18.166 --> 1:40:19.750
I'm saying this is a friend.

1:40:23.166 --> 1:40:24.416
I have a question.

1:40:24.916 --> 1:40:26.333
And a comment.

1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.208
What if I told you, I don't want
to be friends with you anymore?

1:40:31.291 --> 1:40:32.750
What would you do?

1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:37.208
I'd respect your decision.

1:40:40.791 --> 1:40:42.291
You were right that day.

1:40:44.333 --> 1:40:45.708
I was scared.

1:40:52.333 --> 1:40:53.625
What was the comment?

1:40:56.500 --> 1:40:58.083
Seems like…

1:40:59.375 --> 1:41:01.833
seems like fear
has vanished from your eyes.

1:41:21.166 --> 1:41:24.541
The baby is doing fine.
You're due in about eleven weeks.

1:41:27.750 --> 1:41:31.083
I will see you in a couple of weeks
just to see how you're faring.

1:41:32.166 --> 1:41:33.250
Thank you, Doctor.

1:41:33.333 --> 1:41:34.916
I guess we'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

1:41:47.416 --> 1:41:48.250
Khalid?

1:41:58.375 --> 1:41:59.291
Hi.

1:42:00.041 --> 1:42:00.958
Hi.
