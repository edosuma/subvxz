WEBVTT

00:15.432 --> 00:17.308
Sir...

00:17.308 --> 00:18.643
Keep your head down.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.187
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.314
- Let's go.
- Hold on to me.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.778
Are you okay? Get up!
Go! Keep going!

00:28.778 --> 00:30.572
Keep going! Come on!

00:31.322 --> 00:33.158
<i>The refugee mob
is fighting back hard!</i>

00:33.158 --> 00:35.368
<i>Don't let them gain any ground.
Kill them all!</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:51.801
Don't come out till it's dark,
even if the gunshots stop.

02:00.995 --> 02:01.996
Grenade!

03:06.269 --> 03:08.021
CHEONMYEONG MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN

03:25.205 --> 03:27.332
I got the order
to burn them all.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.855
<i>Don't come out till it's dark,
even if the gunshots stop.</i>

04:43.408 --> 04:47.287
BLACK KNIGHT

05:02.760 --> 05:04.637
He's making quite the entrance.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.869
Whoa. Thought I was dead meat there.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.176
Did you wanna die today?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.135
I did.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.471
Not anymore, though.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.479
Gonna do this.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.357
And I've got a reason to do it.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.983
Just tell me how I can win.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.860
I don't care what reason you have.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.904
Telling you won't help much either.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.788
I abhor rudeness.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.043
You got me out of there.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.670
You saved me! Why'd you do that, huh?

06:28.179 --> 06:30.223
How's your head? Your memory back?

06:32.350 --> 06:33.476
You're my only option to win.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.853
- Why?
- You're the strongest there is.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.355
Please.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.958
Prove yourself worthy.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.676
10:00, NOVEMBER 21

07:14.016 --> 07:17.103
<i>But, Unni, uh,
I actually think he could do it.</i>

07:17.103 --> 07:19.230
I've seen him fight a few times.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.441
He's definitely much stronger
than he was--

07:46.716 --> 07:48.885
How many people do you think died?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.261
Thousands.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.347
We thought that we were just resisting,

07:54.515 --> 07:57.768
but Cheonmyeong,
they thought that it was a riot.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.937
Do we have to go on living
like this?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.607
What other option do we have?

08:05.109 --> 08:06.527
I will find one...

08:09.655 --> 08:11.407
no matter how long it takes.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.965
Trying to be a deliveryman, huh?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.136
YOU TOO CAN BECOME A LEGEND LIKE 5-8

08:34.639 --> 08:39.644
Okay, so the legendary 5-8 is gonna
help you become a deliveryman?

08:39.644 --> 08:43.147
No. He said, "Prove yourself worthy."

08:43.731 --> 08:45.066
Yeah, same thing.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.652
- You're always so pessimistic!
- Watch it, man.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.988
- Do you feel confident?
- Well...

08:52.240 --> 08:53.449
whatever it is, I can do it.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.411
I'm also gonna test to see
if 5-8 is the legend that people say.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.915
No, you're the one who's gonna be tested.
Do you even know what the word test means?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.334
Of course I do, moron! It's like an exam.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.629
Wanna be useful, man?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.804
It's not just your future
on the line, it's your life.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.807
Ever heard of passing
through the Gate of Hell?

09:19.183 --> 09:20.226
Gate of Hell?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.399
Ugh. Man, always working late.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.818
I tell them to conserve oxygen,
but they never listen.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.703
Ma'am.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.454
Hmm? You can go.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.498
Uh, may I really?
Because that would be great.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.877
Is something going on?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.630
Yes. Tail team has put out
an emergency report.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.673
5-8?

09:51.924 --> 09:54.010
He's been found
outside the General District.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.222
Oh, you're coming with us?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.017
What, think I'm going home?

10:05.354 --> 10:08.899
PHYSICAL TRAINING FACILITY

10:26.667 --> 10:27.835
Is everyone here?

10:34.550 --> 10:35.468
Let's get started.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.642
It's an old training room
for deliverymen.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.936
I saw 11 people enter, including 5-8.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.481
They were all deliverymen
who used to be refugees.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.817
Deliverymen in the 5-8 line.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.321
They're kidnapping children.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.074
Conducting experiments.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.201
Did you say experiments?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.411
So then do you think Cheonmyeong's
behind everything?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.414
- I know they are.
- Why target children of the miners?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.791
'Cause of the mutation.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.210
Is all that stuff
actually real?

11:15.633 --> 11:16.842
ANALYSIS OF THE REFUGEE SURVIVOR

11:24.850 --> 11:26.310
Oh, it's real.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.524
There are over ten deliverymen,
including 5-8.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.984
What if there's a situation?
What if they fight?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.987
Even better.
It'd give us a reason to arrest them.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.991
The bones are metal,
and wounds heal extremely fast.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.493
So it is real.

11:42.493 --> 11:46.789
But then, I guess nothing's impossible
with how far the world's gone to hell.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.833
If they really are targeting mutants,

11:49.875 --> 11:50.793
the boy's perfect.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.130
You gonna use him
to find the missing children?

11:54.839 --> 11:55.673
If we have to.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.050
He told 5-8 he wanted to be a deliveryman.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.555
The kid needs me as well.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.786
What brings you all the way here
at this hour?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.587
I felt today was the day
we continue our conversation.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.434
Each of the days the kidnappings happened,

12:48.434 --> 12:50.352
5-7 was on leave.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.939
He must have acted as the key,
as a deliveryman.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.651
We put out a wanted notice,
then he's dead. You know why?

12:57.651 --> 12:58.819
Overworking.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.454
Stop right there.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.334
The higher ups ordered
a private investigation.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.251
Was he murdered?

13:14.251 --> 13:16.337
I'm sorry, information's classified.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

13:27.473 --> 13:31.060
It's the first time a deliveryman's died
from overwork since Earth fell apart.

13:31.060 --> 13:31.977
Yes.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.771
Officially.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.524
You don't believe
the official announcement, Major?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.025
I'm very skeptical.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.320
Still missing the testimony
of the key witness.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.080
5-7 was murdered.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.997
Murdered?

13:52.790 --> 13:53.624
Based on what?

13:53.624 --> 13:55.543
I saw the man die.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.213
A tiny device had exploded
inside of his head.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.092
Were there any...
any clues before this happened?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.390
What'd you say?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.559
Where were they all taken?

14:11.559 --> 14:14.687
The human experiments...

14:22.945 --> 14:24.446
The culprits' tattoo.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.700
On the back of their necks.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.954
Kidnappings are happening
in many other places.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.623
Refugees are being taken too.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.875
Oh my God.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.668
It's happening, Major.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.504
Take care out there.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.962
<i>It says he went
to meet 5-8 like you did,</i>

15:22.546 --> 15:23.714
and saw hell.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.258
The Gate of Hell.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.594
Once you go through that gate,

15:28.594 --> 15:30.054
you become pulp.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.973
They beat you up good
until you lose yourself,

15:32.973 --> 15:34.099
and then never let up.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.727
They beat you up? Really? Everyone?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.395
The guy who wrote that book,

15:38.979 --> 15:41.065
he spent a whole week in a coma.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.818
CHAPTER 3
THE GATES OF HELL

15:54.620 --> 15:56.205
You're the Gate of Hell?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.380
Let's go.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.188
Just you guys?

16:21.188 --> 16:22.856
- Who else do you need?
- I mean...

16:25.025 --> 16:26.193
The Gate of Hell...

16:26.735 --> 16:27.736
People fighting?

16:29.613 --> 16:32.116
Did you read that book

16:32.116 --> 16:34.576
<i>I STAKE MY LIFE</i> or whatever?

16:36.453 --> 16:37.371
Let's start.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.289
I can do it.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.711
If you do it, it might kill him.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.380
I can hold back a bit.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.433
Let's see what you got.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.393
I'm ready.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.025
You're slow.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.157
One, two.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.909
Three, four.

17:15.909 --> 17:16.827
Too slow.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.586
Already tired?

17:25.586 --> 17:26.712
Not a chance!

17:30.507 --> 17:31.884
Faster.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.684
Let's go.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
One, two, three...

17:53.697 --> 17:54.698
...four.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.701
Enough of this. Get serious.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.411
That's what you want?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.130
Did you see my fist?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.549
- No.
- Oh.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.051
So, that's where you're at.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.600
What do you think?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.602
He's not disciplined, he's very slow.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.686
Hmm.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.029
Aren't you going?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.656
Should I go

18:36.573 --> 18:38.450
You wanna be a deliveryman, right?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.744
Wouldn't you first have to register?

18:41.578 --> 18:44.873
Uh... oh. Uh-huh.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.543
Use your head and think.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.295
Oh.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.762
What are you drawing?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.061
This doesn't leave the team, okay?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.235
Listen up!

19:13.735 --> 19:15.154
We have new information.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.492

21:59.735 --> 22:03.822
Are you sad that Yoon Sa-wol
is now Refugee 034?

22:07.367 --> 22:09.494
Not exactly sad. It's just that...

22:09.494 --> 22:10.495
Do you know my name?

22:12.789 --> 22:14.374
- 5-8.
- That's right.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.377
I'm 5-8, and she's 4-1.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.881
You're Refugee 034. That's reality.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.425
Oh.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.136
Fine, then.

22:29.056 --> 22:29.973
Now what do I do?

22:47.616 --> 22:48.450
Wait, what's that?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.289
Huh?

22:55.582 --> 22:56.833
Do I dodge those?

22:57.626 --> 22:58.960
No, you hit them all!

23:02.672 --> 23:03.715
Seriously?

23:08.637 --> 23:09.971
Stop dodging and hit the balls!

23:14.351 --> 23:16.353
Your eyes are as slow as your body is.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.855

23:18.855 --> 23:20.190
How about you try it?

24:13.493 --> 24:16.621
<i>The last participant standing
will make it to the second round.</i>

24:18.331 --> 24:21.668
<i>When the round begins,
the oxygen to the rooms will be cut off.</i>

24:30.927 --> 24:33.096
Don't attack for now, just block.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.806
So this is the gang attack.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.019
<i>Oxygen level 100%.</i>

25:11.968 --> 25:14.054
I think he'd be better
if we push him harder.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.556
He's average at best
for a new deliveryman.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.732
Turn it up a notch.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.195
What the...?

25:33.448 --> 25:35.325
<i>Oxygen level 50%</i>.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.993
This is completely insane.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.464
Get it together.
Watch the flow of your opponent.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.038
Shit, shit.

26:36.970 --> 26:37.804
Yeah!

26:37.804 --> 26:39.306
A cocky one.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.350
Shoot the balls faster.
Don't they go any faster? It's too easy!

26:42.350 --> 26:43.435
Whoo, whoo!

27:18.470 --> 27:22.057
<i>Oxygen level 5%...</i>

27:37.989 --> 27:40.784
<i>Oxygen level 1%.</i>

28:25.161 --> 28:27.038
<i>Oxygen is being supplied.</i>

28:35.422 --> 28:38.383
<i>The following participants
will go on to the second round.</i>

28:40.468 --> 28:42.595
<i>Room One, Joo Gyeong-nam.</i>

28:43.346 --> 28:45.306
<i>Room Two, Park Se-seung.</i>

28:46.099 --> 28:48.017
<i>Room Three, Hyeon Su.</i>

28:48.893 --> 28:50.687
<i>Room Four, Yoo Gyeong-sik.</i>

28:51.855 --> 28:53.732
<i>Room Five, Choi Ju-ho.</i>

28:54.649 --> 28:56.484
<i>Room Six, Lee Dong-cheol.</i>

28:57.944 --> 29:00.029
<i>Room Seven, Kim Seung-hyeon.</i>

29:01.072 --> 29:03.742
<i>Room Eight, Refugee 034.</i>

29:07.328 --> 29:10.248
TEHERAN-RO, 9 P.M.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.211
He passed the first round.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.138
He's my only son,
and they took him right in front of me.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.682
The fact
that they left you behind

29:27.682 --> 29:29.517
means it was your son
who mattered to them.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.853
Well, what... what should I do now?

29:31.853 --> 29:34.522
Right now you need to look
for a guy who has this tattoo

29:34.522 --> 29:36.149
on the back of his neck, all right?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.820
I just need to find someone
who has this tattoo?

29:40.820 --> 29:43.114
Yes.
We'll be the ones to arrest him.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.033
Can I notify other districts?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.367
As many as you can.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.702
Okay, I'll do that.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.292
He has a bad skin condition.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.460
Was he a mine worker?

29:56.002 --> 29:59.380
Yes. They took him away
when he was young. Barely escaped

30:03.718 --> 30:05.553
The children of the mines.

30:34.082 --> 30:34.916
Get out.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.419
Everyone, take one.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.763
The destination?

30:48.763 --> 30:50.431
The oxyanium mine.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.810
The work at their district is over,

30:53.810 --> 30:55.812
so they were going there to be killed.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.313
Are you okay?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.774
I volunteered
to be a refugee warden there.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.443
- I'm fine.
- How are things in District A?

31:02.443 --> 31:04.821
I think they're going to test
Air Road operation soon.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.281
We have to delay it.

31:06.281 --> 31:10.076
I'm setting things up here and there
for our next move,

31:10.076 --> 31:12.871
but the security's on high alert
after the last one.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.581
We can't fail this time.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.291
We'll look for a way too.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.252
Which one, arm or leg?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.753
What do you mean?

31:20.753 --> 31:23.339
You're going back.
You need at least one bullet in you.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.924
No, leg, leg.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.050
Arm.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.636
Who did this?

31:28.636 --> 31:30.179
<i>We don't know yet, sir.</i>

31:30.179 --> 31:31.931
<i>A warden survived,
so we're questioning him,</i>

31:31.931 --> 31:33.266
<i>but he's out of his mind.</i>

31:33.266 --> 31:36.102
How dare they go after
what is Cheonmyeong's.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.772
Let's get the military
and guard team on this.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.190
<i>Of course. Yes--</i>

31:46.154 --> 31:47.196
What is it?

31:47.196 --> 31:49.699
<i>The defense minister's party
is here.</i>

31:57.957 --> 31:59.042
Hello, sir.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.628
Major Jung Seol-ah.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.672
Cheonmyeong Group CEO. Good to meet you.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.592
Major Jung Seol-ah, Intelligence Command.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.095
The construction is 90% complete.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.722
We have an agreement with the government

32:12.722 --> 32:14.891
and everything is progressing
under airtight security.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.727
Seems like your security really is tight.

32:18.227 --> 32:20.730
Well, information overload
just leads to chaos.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.232
So you're moving District A
over to the Core,

32:23.232 --> 32:26.444
and the Special and General Districts
are each being upgraded by a level?

32:28.237 --> 32:31.157
Oh, well, I can see why the minister
thinks so much of you.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.285
Another mass exodus will begin.

32:35.578 --> 32:36.871
Cheonmyeong Group,

32:37.580 --> 32:41.501
along with Mr. Ryu,
are doing something extraordinary here.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.544
Why did you ask for me, sir?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.550
I want the files, every district file.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.262
A reassignment of residents, Major,
and I want your cooperation.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.186
Reassignments, huh?

33:00.770 --> 33:01.896
That's correct.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.398
There's no pressure.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.900
Just work with Mr. Ryu.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.986
Cooperation.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.029
I look forward to it, Major.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.500
<i>They do not want you</i>

33:22.500 --> 33:25.420
to lead the relocation plan
for District A.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.298
Is it the president?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.302
GOVERNMENT RELOCATION EXECUTION PLAN

33:33.302 --> 33:35.596
The chairman is behind the president.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.558
Cheonmyeong Group must speak as one

33:40.226 --> 33:42.145
if your plan is to be fully realized.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.067
It's always something.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.260
So I passed?

34:19.766 --> 34:20.767
Can you even drive?

34:22.518 --> 34:23.394
Drive?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.579
Yeah!

34:42.080 --> 34:43.873
Okay, so he can drive.

34:55.343 --> 34:56.594
In this round,

34:56.594 --> 35:00.932
you must deliver a package
safely across the finish line.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.391
Along the route

35:03.226 --> 35:06.979
there are hunters waiting to attack,
each with a special criminal record.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.069
<i>Any hunter who takes your packages</i>

35:14.320 --> 35:16.489
<i>will be released from prison immediately.</i>

35:19.408 --> 35:21.786
Each vehicle is supplied with weapons.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.373
You will use them to stop the hunters
attacks and protect the package.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.707
Can we kill them, sir?

35:27.792 --> 35:28.793
Yes, you may.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.213
In this round,
we will advance two participants

35:32.213 --> 35:35.675
who complete the mission,
whose packages have been delivered safely.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.885
Then the final round, right?

35:37.885 --> 35:39.804
If you're still alive at that point.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.646
Why did you have us come here?

35:48.646 --> 35:51.607
You're here as observers
to make sure the competition is fair.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.571
Mr. Ryu is here.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.700
Good work, everybody.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.051
<i>The second round
of the Cheonmyeong Deliveryman</i>

36:19.051 --> 36:21.387
<i>Selection Competition will begin.</i>

36:21.387 --> 36:22.930
Man, these are beat up.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.569
What?

36:36.569 --> 36:39.572
NUMBER EIGHT
REFUGEE 034

36:40.156 --> 36:41.532
You just drive straight?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.535
<i>The two participants
who make it to the finish line first</i>

36:44.535 --> 36:46.245

<i>Emergency.
Hunter vehicles approaching.</i>

37:55.564 --> 37:58.067
<i>Use your weapons to take down the hunters.</i>

37:58.651 --> 38:00.361
Whoa!

40:10.699 --> 40:12.076
<i>Off course.</i>

40:12.701 --> 40:14.578
That competitor's the only refugee, right?

40:14.578 --> 40:16.038
Yes, that's right.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.457

41:42.541 --> 41:44.001
<i>Currently, in second place.</i>

<i>Participant number Eight,

42:13.489 --> 42:14.907
Huh? Number Three?

42:18.035 --> 42:19.495
Wait!

42:19.495 --> 42:20.913
I could push your car.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.248
Let me ride along.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.710
Step on it!
