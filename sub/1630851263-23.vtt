00:34.077 --> 00:37.863
Ah, I just love the smell
of this place.

00:37.907 --> 00:41.215
The aroma of sweaty feet
encased in the shoe leather

00:41.258 --> 00:43.521
is most pleasing
to the nose.

00:45.393 --> 00:46.437
Let's skate!

01:10.592 --> 01:14.596
Well, well, well, looks like
we've got some fresh meat.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.642
- Ooh, they certainly have
all the right moves.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.560
Hiya, ladies.

01:22.604 --> 01:25.563
Harley Quinn,
Poison Ivy and Catwoman?

01:25.607 --> 01:27.391
You ladies here
to rob the joint?

01:27.435 --> 01:29.915
No, but I was thinking
of stealing your moves.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.743
We're not here
to start anything.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.745
We were just admiring
your skating.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.748
Thanks. But we usually
don't accept compliments
from villains.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.405
You don't trust us. I get it.
We're the bad guys.
But hear us out.

01:41.449 --> 01:45.105
We're looking
for two new recruits
to join our roller derby team.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.585
What is this
derby of the roller?

01:47.629 --> 01:50.414
- You like skating?
- Oh, yes. The very much.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.634
You like punching people
in the face?

01:52.677 --> 01:55.811
- Who doesn't?
- Then let us show you
what it's about.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.335
Sure. Whatever.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.863
Girls, meet our manager, Lou.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.825
- Your manager's a hyena?
- Pretty cool, right?

02:09.868 --> 02:12.436
Oh, Lou is the adorable!

02:16.658 --> 02:18.138
Let's roll!

02:27.190 --> 02:29.801
Whoa, what kind of
sketchy place is this?

02:29.845 --> 02:32.152
Welcome to roller Derby, girls.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.638
So, what do you say?

02:40.682 --> 02:41.857
We're in!

02:41.900 --> 02:43.641
Perfect.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.166
Okay, let me show you
how to play the game.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.472
Two teams face off
on an oval track.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.648
Each team's got five players.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.216
Four blockers and one jammer.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.653
The jammer
gets to wear a star
in their helmet.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.178
I wish to be
the jammer.

02:58.221 --> 03:01.529
My name is the star
and I love the jam.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.226
Done and done.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.010
Now, the whole point
of the game

03:05.054 --> 03:06.316
is for the jammers to get past
the other team's blockers.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.013
After initial pass,

03:08.057 --> 03:09.885
the jammer tries to get past
the blockers again,

03:09.928 --> 03:11.539
this time scoring a point
for every blocker
they can get past.

03:11.582 --> 03:12.540
Simple, right?

03:14.716 --> 03:16.848
Um... sure.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.328
<i>Up next,</i>

03:18.372 --> 03:20.025
<i>-the Gotham City Sirens.</i>

03:20.069 --> 03:23.028
That's us.
Come on, girls. We're up.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.508
Whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

03:24.552 --> 03:25.857
We can't compete tonight.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.511
We have not the practised.

03:27.555 --> 03:30.210
Who needs practice?
Just wing it.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.083
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:34.126 --> 03:36.868
<i>here come
the Gotham City Sirens.</i>

03:39.915 --> 03:41.351
<i>Snarly Harley.</i>

03:41.395 --> 03:44.093
<i>Ulyssys S. Plant.</i>

03:44.136 --> 03:45.877
<i>Fright Bite.</i>

03:45.921 --> 03:48.097
<i>Car Fire on the 405.</i>

03:48.140 --> 03:51.927
<i>And Grapes of Azarath.</i>

03:51.970 --> 03:54.059
<i>And their furious challengers,</i>

03:54.103 --> 03:56.279
<i>the Brainy Brawlers.</i>

03:56.323 --> 03:58.542
Oh, derby funk!

03:58.586 --> 04:01.241
The Brainy Brawlers
are one of the roughest,
toughest teams in the league

04:15.951 --> 04:19.781
<i>Oh!
Car Fire on the 405
takes a butt to the gut.</i>

04:23.828 --> 04:25.134
These Brawlers are tough.

04:25.177 --> 04:28.006
We've got this, girls.
Just push!

04:31.793 --> 04:33.969
Oh, they've got
telekinetic powers?

04:34.012 --> 04:36.928
They don't call them
"Brainy" for nothing.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.418
I am still feeling
the butt gut.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.639
Ow! I think I broke
a branch or two.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.337
Hmm. I don't think we can beat
these Brainy broads.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.302
Lou is right.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.305
If we wanna win this,
then we're gonna have to
pull out the big guns.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.438
Yes, and with our
combined big guns,

05:08.482 --> 05:10.614
we will be doing
the mass destruction

05:10.658 --> 05:13.791
and the utter annihilations!

05:13.835 --> 05:16.011
Oh yeah, you know it.

05:16.054 --> 05:20.015
Come on, ladies. It's time
to tighten those laces
and punch some faces.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.670
Now you're speaking
my language.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.498
Derby iz 4eva, girls.

05:33.681 --> 05:38.338
Oh, I'm sorry.
Looks like you got
a little rink rash.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.252
Watch your step.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.169
I am the jammer.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.346
You get the jam.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.696
And you get the jam!

05:51.525 --> 05:54.354
You're just felt
the Grapes of Azarath, baby.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.364
<i>And the Sirens
are on the board.</i>

06:18.595 --> 06:20.205
Look, girls.
We're down by four.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.251
And we have 30 seconds
left to score.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.868
- Oh, no.
It's a Brawler Wall.
- Brawler Wall!

06:30.912 --> 06:33.393
How are we ever gonna get
Star over that wall?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.220
There's only one way.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.874
Roller Vault.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.268
Roller Vault?

06:39.311 --> 06:41.749
No. No, no, no.
That's too dangerous.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.447
Ha! My middle name
is "Dangerous."

06:44.491 --> 06:47.232
Actually, it's Frances.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.409
Whatever, it's the only way.
Let's roll.

07:10.995 --> 07:14.912
<i>The Sirens win.
The Sirens win!</i>

07:19.961 --> 07:21.745
We won.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.617
I can't believe that worked.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.450
Derby iz 4eva, girls.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.930
- Great jammin' out there.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.106
Thanks. This team rocks.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.325
Hey, where's Lou?

07:38.849 --> 07:42.287
He was taken.
By the Brainy Brawlers.

07:44.159 --> 07:47.771
"Lou is ours now.
And you are never
getting him back"?

07:47.815 --> 07:49.512
"Signed, the Brainy Brawlers"?

07:49.556 --> 07:53.124
I can't live without Lou.
He's my best friend.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.476
We will help you rescue him.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.652
Do you know where
the Brawlers hide out?

07:58.695 --> 08:02.786
Yeah. But it's impossible
to get around their security.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.484
Then we'll just
have to go through it.

08:07.182 --> 08:10.011
There. That's the building.
That's their hideout.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.677
Oh, I hear my Louie.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.679
He must be behind
this steel door.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.162
I do not see the Lou.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.208
Uh, I don't think
we came here to rescue Lou.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.819
Surprise!

08:35.863 --> 08:37.517
I can't believe it worked.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.649
So, getting us to join
your roller derby team

08:39.693 --> 08:41.172
was all just
part of an elaborate plan

08:41.216 --> 08:42.870
to trick us into
helping you pull off a heist?

08:42.913 --> 08:44.524
Very smart, right?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.003
Hurtful, actually.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.352
What'd you expect?
We're the bad guys.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.355
But what about the Lou?

08:50.399 --> 08:52.009
Oh, he's fine.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.576
He's actually waiting outside
in the getaway car.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.446
Toodles!

08:56.710 --> 08:58.886
- Hit it, Louie baby!

09:18.949 --> 09:21.386
Wow, you know,
they're really good.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.736
Leave them to me.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.146
- Bad kitty, bad kitty.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.148
The bad kitty!

09:47.151 --> 09:48.979
Come on, Lou. Punch it.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.767
They're getting away.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.465
Then it's time for the jammer
to do what jammers do best.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.424
I am the jammer.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.775
And I will do the jamming.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.092
Sorry, Sirens.
You're going to jail.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.268
I get it. We're the bad guys.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.619
But when we break out,
we're totally getting
the team back together.

10:19.662 --> 10:20.620
Right?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.449
Derby iz 4eva, girls.
