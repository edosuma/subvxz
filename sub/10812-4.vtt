WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.602
- My name is nathan fielder,

00:02.636 --> 00:04.805
And I graduated from one
of canada's top business schools

00:04.838 --> 00:07.074
With really good grades.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.243
Now I'm using my knowledge

00:09.276 --> 00:11.111
To help struggling
small business owners

00:11.144 --> 00:12.779
Make it in this
competitive world.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074

00:28.362 --> 00:31.999
This is nathan for you.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.801
Running a gas station
is not easy,

00:34.835 --> 00:37.037
And no one knows that more
than daniel ashikian

00:37.070 --> 00:39.139
Of sevan gas
in burbank, california.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.974
- It's tough business.

00:41.008 --> 00:44.378
I cannot compete
with the big companies.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.280
- With these days
it being more economical

00:46.313 --> 00:48.649
To fill up your car
with champagne,

00:48.682 --> 00:50.517
It can be hard
to draw in customers.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.853
So I paid daniel a visit
with an innovative way

00:52.886 --> 00:54.821
To lower his prices.

00:54.855 --> 00:58.792
So I want you to charge
$1.75 per gallon.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.794
- You know what is utopia?
- Yeah.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.729
- It's in your mind.

01:02.763 --> 01:06.533
You're not gonna see
$1.75 gasoline anymore.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.202
Only in the pictures.
- Well, listen--

01:08.235 --> 01:10.170
- No, no, no.
You get reasonable--

01:10.204 --> 01:12.139
- No, I am being--
I am reasonable.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.374
You didn't let me finish.
- Okay.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.076
- After rebate.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.177
- Oh.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.512
- The plan:

01:18.545 --> 01:20.714
$1.75 gas after rebate.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.850
A rebate will legally
allow daniel

01:22.883 --> 01:25.352
To advertise the cheapest gas
in the country.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.987
And because
it's such a great deal,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
It would only be fair
to make claiming this rebate

01:29.122 --> 01:31.491
A bit more inconvenient
than normal,

01:31.525 --> 01:34.394
By asking customers
to drop it off in person

01:34.428 --> 01:36.730
At the top of a mountain.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.499
- At the top
of the mountain.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.003
Yeah, that's good tricky way
to make money.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.106
- About an hour and a half
drive from sevan gas

01:46.106 --> 01:48.275
In the middle of
the angeles national forest,

01:48.308 --> 01:52.012
The peak of mount chileo
is only accessible by foot.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.614
I explained to daniel

01:53.647 --> 01:55.349
That as long as he was up front
with his customers,

01:55.382 --> 01:57.384
Putting the rebate box
atop chileo

01:57.417 --> 02:00.053
Was completely 100% legal.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.722
- If some of them
is gonna claim it,

02:01.755 --> 02:04.424
It's gonna cost me money,
right?

02:04.458 --> 02:05.859
- Do you think people
are gonna hike up a mountain

02:05.893 --> 02:07.761
To get this rebate?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.229
- Uh...

02:09.263 --> 02:11.098
- After a week
to get everything prepared,

02:11.131 --> 02:13.233
We implemented the offer.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.435
Within minutes
of the sign going up,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.271
It proved to be
an instant hit,

02:17.304 --> 02:20.440
With a line of cars
down the block.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.209
- Is it really $1.75?

02:22.242 --> 02:23.710
- After rebate.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.912
- What type of rebate?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.213
- It's not mail-In rebate.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.148
You have to take it
personally.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.550
- Where's it at?

02:29.583 --> 02:32.152
- Mountain chile.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.454
- Where?
- Mountain chile.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.256
Nathan, it's mountain chile,
right?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.558
- What's so special
about this place

02:37.591 --> 02:38.892
We have to go
and get the rebate?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.561
- That's just where
the drop box is.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.962
- You can't just mail it in,
like just--

02:41.995 --> 02:43.830
- It's not
a mail-In rebate, no.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.232
- Uh, i'll get the gas,

02:45.265 --> 02:46.266
But, no, I don't want
the rebate.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.668
- Okay, it's up to you.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.769
You don't want to do it,
it's fine.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.637
- It's up to you.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.739
Well, we're providing a free
shuttle to the base if you want,

02:52.773 --> 02:54.141
And then it's an hour and a half
hike from there.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.676
- Are you kidding me?

02:55.709 --> 02:56.910
- It's totally official.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.312
Everything is explained there.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.848
Like I expected,
people were filling up

03:00.881 --> 03:03.617
And no one wanted
to claim the rebate.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.152
But then,
the tide shifted.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.587
- Hey, I'm back.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.921
I changed my clothes,
and I'm ready.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.623
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.358
- That sounds good.
Yeah, i've never been there.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.593
- You're gonna do it?

03:12.626 --> 03:13.827
- Yeah.
Is that cool?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.663
- Yeah, yeah,
that's great.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.599
- I've hiked.
I like hiking.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.101
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.336
- I've never
been up there before.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.804
I hear the view
is beautiful.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.673
- It was clearly working
to bring in customers,

03:26.707 --> 03:29.977
But to my surprise the shuttle
was actually filling up.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.145
I saw that this
was worrying daniel,

03:32.179 --> 03:34.648
And I took him aside
for a chat.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.817
To be honest,
i didn't expect

03:36.850 --> 03:38.519
So many people
to want to do the hike.

03:38.552 --> 03:44.558
However, be assured
that once they get up there,

03:44.591 --> 03:46.126
It's only just beginning.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.161
- Okay.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.699
- It was going to take
an hour and a half

03:52.733 --> 03:54.568
To drive to the base
of the mountain,

03:54.601 --> 03:56.503
So we'll check back
with this in a bit.

03:56.537 --> 04:01.041
But first, do you find
this drawing funny?

04:01.041 --> 04:03.076
If you answered yes,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.512
You're probably caricature
artist greg dohlen.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.848
He was the one that drew it.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.083
And after two decades
of doing caricatures,

04:10.117 --> 04:12.519
He has yet
to make a name for himself.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.720
- It's always a struggle.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.155
And i've kind of--

04:15.189 --> 04:16.822
I've been doing this
since '89.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.091
- But sometimes
the solution is as simple

04:19.125 --> 04:21.228
As keeping up
with the trends.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.197
- You drew me here.
- Yeah.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.665
- It's enjoyable
to see yourself

04:24.698 --> 04:26.366
Portrayed as a cartoon.
- Yeah.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.069
- But I don't think
it makes me laugh.

04:29.069 --> 04:32.172
Caricatures
are insult comedy.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.740
- Well, yeah.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.409
- In the category
of insult comedy,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.411
Just to show you what's
currently popular right now,

04:37.444 --> 04:39.246
Here, just watch.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.949
- I like you, jason alexander.
I find you sexy.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.584
Kiss me, you fat [bleep].

04:43.617 --> 04:45.118
I've always wanted to see

04:45.152 --> 04:47.087
What jerry seinfeld's
[bleep] tastes like.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.523
- I showed him a clip
of the wildly popular

04:49.556 --> 04:51.124
Comedy central roasts,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.760
Which proved that to be
a hit in insult comedy,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.762
The meaner you are,
the better.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.097
The plan:

04:57.097 --> 05:00.067
To re-Brand greg
as "the king of sting."

05:00.100 --> 05:03.470
- Um, i've got--I've gotten
more negative reactions

05:03.504 --> 05:07.407
From going extreme
than positive reactions.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.243
- No one liked elvis
when he first came out,

05:09.276 --> 05:10.377
You know what I mean?

05:10.410 --> 05:11.945
People were offended.
- Right.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.447
- But you have
to power through that

05:13.480 --> 05:15.082
If you wanna become big.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.051
At first, greg seemed
resistant to the concept.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.620
But as we started
brainstorming ideas...

05:19.653 --> 05:21.321
- Yeah, it might be funny
if he's chinese,

05:21.355 --> 05:23.390
And I make him a photographer
with the big buck teeth.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.825
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.593
- Little squinty eyes
and big buck teeth.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.761
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.496
He quickly began
to embrace it.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.132
I left him with a few edgy
concepts of my own to work on,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.901
And he started
sketching them out.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.970
The next day, I returned
to see the results.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.907
All right, so this is
the idea I had for a couple,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.575
And you have to draw a couple.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.143
So that's you, the artist,

05:43.177 --> 05:45.078
Uh, doing the woman
of the couple from behind,

05:45.078 --> 05:48.248
Doggy style,
she's saying, "i like this."

05:48.282 --> 05:51.618
Her boyfriend is looking
at a hummingbird's penis

05:51.652 --> 05:53.453
And thinking, "that's huge."

05:53.487 --> 05:55.489
Yeah, this is good.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.090
It's really funny.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.929
This is, um, your version
of an asian businessman.

06:02.029 --> 06:07.301
Um, do you think
this one, uh...hmm...

06:07.334 --> 06:09.870
- See, I'm not--
I'm not sure, uh,

06:09.903 --> 06:11.305
When you presented
an asian picture

06:11.338 --> 06:12.773
Which direction
i should go with it.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.208
I went all directions really.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.210
We could try it out,
see how it goes.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.845
- Sure, yeah.
I mean, I'm not gonna get--

06:17.878 --> 06:19.646
You know, in art, you know,

06:19.680 --> 06:21.114
You don't want to get
in people's way or anything,

06:21.148 --> 06:23.150
So I'm not gonna--
But, yeah.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.952
I mean,
this is definitely--

06:25.052 --> 06:28.222
I mean, the pearl harbor thing
is almost not even a joke.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.290
The rest of greg's new edgy
caricatures looked great,

06:30.324 --> 06:32.459
And I could tell that
he was ready to try them out

06:32.492 --> 06:34.695
In the real world.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.504
- Do you have any hobbies?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.973
- I like to bike
and surf a lot.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.909
I like swimming, deejaying,
playing the trombone.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.084
- Things were off
to an okay start,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.586
But I got kind of worried
when an asian man sat down.

06:59.620 --> 07:04.191
- I draw caricatures that are
a little mean and edgy.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.592
Are you okay with that?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.427
- Definitely.
- Yeah, okay, good.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.270
How's that?

07:17.638 --> 07:18.739
You like it?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.107
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.376
- But I was wrong.
The guy loved it.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.345
You like it?
- Yeah, yeah, I like it.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.048
- And from then on,
it was smooth sailing.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.191
- Oh, nice, man.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.593
- Will that work?
- That'll work, dude.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.206
- Greg was hitting
nothing but home runs,

07:52.239 --> 07:55.175
And it was amazing
to watch him work.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.016
- Oh, nice.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.569
- So how do you feel
it all went today?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.037
People laughed.
I saw people laughing.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.639
- People laughed.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.941
Like, the deep side
of people's humor comes out

08:28.041 --> 08:29.810
When you show them shock.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.512
- You know, at the beginning
of all this,

08:31.545 --> 08:33.413
I had you draw me,
it wasn't funny.

08:33.447 --> 08:36.283
So now with everything
that i've taught you,

08:36.316 --> 08:40.654
I'm saying go as hard
as you want on me,

08:40.687 --> 08:41.822
As mean as you want.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.123
- You want the king of sting?

08:43.155 --> 08:44.825
- I want the king of sting.
- Okay.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.460
- 'Cause I wanna laugh.
- Okay.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.479
- All right,
this is funny,

09:05.512 --> 09:08.549
But it's hard for me
to see my grandpa

09:08.582 --> 09:11.018
Depicted in that way.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.187
He's a canadian war hero,

09:13.220 --> 09:14.821
And he's, like, a very--

09:14.855 --> 09:17.691
He has, like, a very important
role in our family,

09:17.724 --> 09:19.693
So I don't like seeing him
depicted like this.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.729
It just--

09:22.763 --> 09:26.033
It was a real shame that
greg chose to end the day

09:26.033 --> 09:27.501
On such a tasteless note.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.503
But regardless
of my feelings,

09:29.536 --> 09:32.206
He truly was
the king of sting.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.440
- My gas station
rebate was underway.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.880
But as we shuttled
to the base of chileo,

09:42.910 --> 09:44.410
I began to doubt

09:44.450 --> 09:46.210
That any of these
eight determined cheapskates

09:46.250 --> 09:48.720
Would drop out before reaching
the peak of the mountain.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.750
You might think
i'd be nervous

09:50.790 --> 09:52.650
That sevan gas
was going to lose money,

09:52.690 --> 09:54.660
But what I had told no one

09:54.690 --> 09:57.960
Is that this was about more
than just helping a gas station.

09:57.990 --> 10:01.560
I set out to create the world's
first perfect rebate,

10:01.600 --> 10:06.230
A completely legal rebate
that absolutely no one claims.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.670
Fortunately, most of them failed
to read the fine print

10:08.700 --> 10:10.640
On their rebate slips.

10:10.670 --> 10:13.170
They didn't realize they
had signed up for a lot more

10:13.210 --> 10:14.940
Than just a hike.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.580
- The gentleman who worked
in the gas station

10:16.610 --> 10:18.910
Told me that I would have to
come hike mount chileo

10:18.950 --> 10:20.750
To get that rebate.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.690
It's been a long day,
but it's been an adventure,

10:23.720 --> 10:25.850
So it's not too bad.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.490
- What appealed
to me about it

10:27.520 --> 10:30.130
Was it just sounded
kind of interesting.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.990
And once you're there,
you might as well do it.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.130
I love being out here
out of the city,

10:34.160 --> 10:35.760
Getting to relax a bit,

10:35.800 --> 10:37.770
But it is a little bit
apprehensive

10:37.800 --> 10:40.300
Because it's the woods.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.270
- All right,
welcome to mount chileo,

10:46.270 --> 10:48.840
A place whose history
is as rich

10:48.880 --> 10:51.010
As its peak is high.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.450
Do you have any questions?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.480
- Where's the box?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.480
- Well, you have
to answer some riddles first.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.290
- Wait, at the gas station
you just told us

10:58.290 --> 11:00.790
We'd have to insert the paper
into a box or something

11:00.820 --> 11:02.820
And then get our rebate.
- Right.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.160
- Nothing was mentioned
about a riddle

11:04.190 --> 11:05.960
Or a series of riddles.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.730
- Look, I don't have to pick up
my kid till 3:00 tomorrow.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.860
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.130
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.830
- I'm a me, me, me system.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.200
I take care of me,
i wash me, I feed me.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.300
- Okay, be quiet
so we can--

11:16.300 --> 11:19.170
I was going to point out that
this was all in the fine print,

11:19.210 --> 11:20.980
But they didn't even
seem to care.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.380
This might go on longer
than I thought.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.350
I've been resting
for a million years,

11:25.380 --> 11:28.720
But I never sleep.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.650
I'm a kind of music,

11:30.690 --> 11:34.860
But out here
i do not make a peep.

11:34.890 --> 11:36.890
- Wind.
Woodwinds, wind music.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.830
- Is it the wind?
- Is it wind?

11:38.860 --> 11:41.000
- It is not wind.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.330
- Rock.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.770
- Yes.
- Right on.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.270
- Great, okay.

11:45.270 --> 11:48.270
All right, so the next riddle
is under a rock.

11:48.270 --> 11:50.740
I was stunned
by the number of people

11:50.770 --> 11:53.580
That had given up their
entire day for cheap gas.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.540
Was it the thrill
of saving money?

11:56.580 --> 11:59.410
Or were these people
just completely insane?

11:59.450 --> 12:01.380
But after nearly
an hour of riddles,

12:01.420 --> 12:03.850
People finally started
dropping out.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.350
You have a test at 9:00?

12:05.390 --> 12:08.460
- Yeah, but, I mean,
i do want that rebate.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.460
- What percent
of your grade is it over?

12:10.490 --> 12:11.860
- It's about 30% roughly.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.560
- Yeah, you can't miss that.
- No.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.130
- I was thankful there were some
sensible people in the group,

12:17.170 --> 12:19.030
But not matter
how hard I tried...

12:19.070 --> 12:20.600
You know, but again, if you
don't want to claim the rebate,

12:20.640 --> 12:23.540
I can understand
if you would wanna leave.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.910
Some people
just wouldn't go.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.910
I am round and hard.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.550
In water,
i sink deep.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.080
But if you do me
to a baby,

12:32.110 --> 12:35.880
He surely shall sleep.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.820
- Do you have any intentions
on giving us our rebates?

12:37.850 --> 12:39.320
- Yeah, we're almost done
with the riddles.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.920
It's just dark,
it's hard to read them.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.620
- I can read it for you
if you'd like.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.830
- Well, I think we should
just finish in the morning.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.730
- Everything that you told us
today hasn't happened.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.300
Yeah, we're here.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.070
- Wait, you can't be
so annoyed right now.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.900
- I can't be annoyed?
- No.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.570
- You're out of your mind!

12:54.600 --> 12:56.500
- Well, why are you--
This is part of the deal.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.070
This is the rebate.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.140
- No, the deal is I stay,
i get my rebate.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.080
If you're staying,
you can't yell at me like that.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.620
It's not appropriate.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.820
- Okay, I'm not going
nowhere then.

13:12.850 --> 13:15.090
- I didn't think
it would get to this point,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.030
But I had tents
and camping gear on hand.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.630
Three people
decided to stay the night.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.270
- Do you guys know
won't be the same

13:24.300 --> 13:28.100
By pettinger, bojanic,
and hooper?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.210
- Nope.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.540
- It's a royalty-Free
music song

13:31.570 --> 13:33.440
From the internet.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.110
- Well, play it.
Let's hear it.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.510
- It goes a little
something like this.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.950
Âª these days
i just can't think straight ♪

13:40.980 --> 13:43.720
Âª I got too many angles

13:43.750 --> 13:45.890
Âª running round my brain

13:45.920 --> 13:49.060
Âª 'cause I know

13:49.090 --> 13:53.190
Âª it won't be the same

13:53.230 --> 13:54.800
Âª won't be the--

13:54.830 --> 13:56.500
- The only drugs
that the fda will approve

13:56.530 --> 13:58.530
Are drugs that
pharmaceutical companies

13:58.570 --> 14:00.540
Will spend $200 million on.

14:00.570 --> 14:03.340
- As ray began lecturing me
about alternative medicine,

14:03.370 --> 14:05.870
I found myself regretting
this whole plan.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.380
- Naturopaths drink urine.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.650
They tell their patients
to drink urine,

14:10.680 --> 14:12.550
And that's part of a cure,
and the reason why--

14:12.580 --> 14:14.380
- So you would drink urine?

14:14.420 --> 14:18.220
- It's safer than
almost anything out there.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.490
- If my naturopath told me
to drink urine,

14:20.520 --> 14:22.090
I might--I might--

14:22.090 --> 14:23.390
- Like, whose urine?

14:23.430 --> 14:24.530
- Their own urine.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.760
- Drink your own urine?
- Yeah.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.230
- But as the night went on,

14:28.260 --> 14:30.100
I began to see that ray,
laurie, and elizabeth

14:30.100 --> 14:32.200
Weren't just cheapskates
looking for a deal.

14:32.230 --> 14:35.600
In fact, money was
the least of their problems.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.110
- So now the state police
major crimes squad

14:38.110 --> 14:40.280
Is investigating me
for arson.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.610
Still wear my wedding ring
25 years later.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.850
Haven't talked to her
in 23 years or so.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.550
- You need to be
with someone else.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.120
Your wife left you
25 years ago,

14:50.120 --> 14:51.620
And you haven't
moved on yet.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.690
- How come I have
to do this first?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.420
- 'Cause you have no fear
of anything.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.930
- I have a fear
of kissing people.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.960
- Hey.
- Oh, laurie.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.130
- That's not laurie.
- Yes, it's on laurie.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.700
- You know, I wasn't
supposed to leave him.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.870
You know,
i was supposed to stay.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.270
Um...

15:10.310 --> 15:13.610
But you can only push
a person so far.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.240
- Do you want a hug?

15:19.510 --> 15:21.380
- Thank you.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.220
- So the pharmaceutical
companies don't want us to know

15:24.250 --> 15:25.720
That we can
drink our own pee

15:25.750 --> 15:27.220
And that will cure
every disease?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.590
- That's right.
How come you got away with--

15:29.620 --> 15:31.630
- Oh!
Ray!

15:31.660 --> 15:33.660
- What?
- Elizabeth.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.400
- Ray.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.000
- By the end of the night,

15:38.100 --> 15:41.840
I felt like I had made
new friends.

15:41.870 --> 15:44.810
Let's do it, man.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.110
It'll be fun.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.580
You wanna come?

15:49.610 --> 15:52.310
- No, I'm sleeping.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.150
- All right,
so it's 4:15 a.M.,

15:54.180 --> 15:57.020
And I'm gonna go play a prank
on the girls' tent.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.680
Oh, my god.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.980
I can't believe
she stayed asleep

16:26.080 --> 16:28.480
The whole way in the tent.

16:43.730 --> 16:46.700
All right, day two.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.970
You ready?
- We're ready.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.310
- My cousin
holds ice cream.

16:51.340 --> 16:54.340
My uncle reroutes traffic.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.680
You can find
a wreath made of me

16:56.710 --> 16:58.810
Up in your grandma's attic.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.250
- A wreath of me--

17:00.280 --> 17:02.550
- Santa claus is the only thing
i can think of.

17:02.580 --> 17:03.850
- Lights.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.420
- Let me honest
with you guys.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.160
- Yeah.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.390
- This will never end.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.260
When I began this thing,

17:11.290 --> 17:12.829
I never thought
that I would meet

17:12.859 --> 17:15.760
Three people
with so much free time

17:15.800 --> 17:18.329
That they'd be willing
to camp out

17:18.369 --> 17:20.170
On the top of a mountain
with a complete stranger

17:20.200 --> 17:23.440
Just to save $13 on gas.

17:23.470 --> 17:24.839
But I did.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.940
And those three people
turned out to be

17:27.980 --> 17:31.580
Three of the most fantastic
people i've ever met.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.380
- Yeah.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.250
- Over the past 24 hours,

17:35.280 --> 17:37.090
We've all gained something

17:37.090 --> 17:40.720
Even more valuable
than a rebate--Friendship.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.390
- Amen.
- I totally agree.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.190
- So what do you say we all go
down this mountain as friends?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.860
- Yes.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.200
- And take that to the bank
instead of the rebate?

17:50.230 --> 17:52.370
Because to be
perfectly honest,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.470
There is no rebate box.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.970
- I knew that there
was no rebate box.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.710
- Well, we agree with you,

17:59.740 --> 18:01.780
The friendship that we gained
here is just incredible,

18:01.810 --> 18:04.880
So let's go down the mountain.

18:04.910 --> 18:07.120
- All right, come.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.780
I really did
like these guys.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.290
But in the end,

18:11.320 --> 18:13.720
Business is business.

18:28.170 --> 18:29.900
- The next day,
i headed back to sevan gas

18:29.940 --> 18:31.200
To follow up with daniel.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.840
So?

18:32.870 --> 18:35.910
- It works, but let's see
how many people

18:35.940 --> 18:40.510
Gonna come and pick up
the rebate.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.550
Oh, we got one.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.820
Nathan fielder.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.420
Oh, that's you.
Nathan.

18:48.450 --> 18:51.260
- Only one person,
which is pretty good, you know?

18:51.290 --> 18:52.660
- You wanna get
your rebate, huh?

18:52.690 --> 18:53.660
- Yeah, yeah.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.900
- $16.54.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.360
- I did this whole crazy thing

18:58.400 --> 19:01.100
So people
wouldn't redeem the rebate.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.870
But really in the end,

19:03.900 --> 19:06.610
What I realized is that
more important than any of this

19:06.640 --> 19:08.410
Is friendship.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.610
- Oh, that's right.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.180
- And doing this
i made some very good friends.

19:14.210 --> 19:16.920
Ray premus
was one of them.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.380
- Who?

19:18.420 --> 19:20.950
- Ray premus.
- Oh.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.390
- He was willing
to drink pee.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.890
- Pee?
- Yeah.

19:25.930 --> 19:26.890
- Whose pee?

19:26.930 --> 19:28.460
- No, just anyone's pee.

19:28.490 --> 19:30.100
- Anyone's pee?
- He says there's no germs.

19:30.130 --> 19:32.600
- Maybe they can drink
my grandson's pee.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.070
It's very clean.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.100
Yeah?

19:37.140 --> 19:40.370
- Why--
- Because it's clean.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.910
Why drink my pee
or your pee?

19:41.940 --> 19:43.840
- You're promoting
your grandson's pee.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.550
- I am promoting because
grandson's pee sometimes helps.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.410
It really helps.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.720
- Have you drank
your grandson's pee?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.120
- Yeah.
- Why?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.390
- I was scared.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.990
- What do you mean
you were scared?

19:55.020 --> 19:57.560
- Yeah, sometimes
you're scared for something.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.130
- What are you talking about?

19:59.160 --> 20:00.490
- Accident or something,

20:00.530 --> 20:02.060
You drink
the grandson's pee,

20:02.100 --> 20:03.760
And it's gonna help you.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.570
- I don't understand.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.070
Why does it help you if
you drink your grandson's pee?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.640
- That's what they say,
yeah.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.640
- Who says that?
- My grandma.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.170
- Your grandma said--
- Long time ago, yeah.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.580
- You drink your grandson's
pee if you get scared?

20:16.610 --> 20:19.880
- Not grandson's.
Any little kid.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.980
- You drink any--

20:21.010 --> 20:22.280
- Not over age of five,

20:22.320 --> 20:24.420
Because before
over age of five,

20:24.450 --> 20:26.490
It's terrible.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.390
- I have never--
- I am serious about it.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.520
- But why--

20:30.560 --> 20:31.860
- Yeah, if you're scared,

20:31.890 --> 20:33.830
You drink
the small child's pee.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.500
It helps.
I heard from my grandma.

20:37.530 --> 20:40.330
You can ask your parents
or grandparents.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.370
Maybe they tell you too.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.970
- I will ask, I guess.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.840
- Thank you
for giving this idea.
