YOU'RE AN ARROGANT,
POMPOUS JERK, MURTAGH,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.689
AND NOW YOU'LL DIE.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.758
I'M NOT MURTAGH.
I'M WINSLOW.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.593
YOU'RE BLOWING UP
THE WRONG GUY.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.128
KEEP WALKING, MURTAGH,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.764
OR YOU'LL
BE BLOWN TO BITS.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.560
YOU WANT ME TO GET
LIEUTENANT MURTAGH HERE?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.229
IF THIS BOMB
GOES OFF,

15:29.296 --> 15:31.898
IT'LL KILL ANYBODY
WHO'S WITH ME.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.167
GET HIM IN HERE.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.805
OKAY. JUST STAY CALM.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.640

I FEEL GOOD.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.477
I FEEL GREAT.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.349
I'M GOING TO DIE.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.796
I CAME AS SOON
AS I HEARD.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.298
THE BOMB SQUAD COMING?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.000
ALL THE BOMB UNITS
ARE BUSY.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.335
ALL OF THEM?
HOW COME?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.338
THE MIDDLE EAST
PEACE CONFERENCE
IS IN TOWN.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.305
WHAT?

16:12.372 --> 16:14.807
SHOULDN'T YOU
KEEP WALKING?

16:14.874 --> 16:16.076
OH.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.377
WAIT. OH.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.680

TO CATCH MY BREATH.

16:32.392 --> 16:36.463
LISTEN.
LET'S SWITCH PLACES
WITHOUT STOPPING.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.330
WE CAN TRADE OFF

16:37.397 --> 16:39.399
UNTIL THE BOMB
SQUAD GETS HERE.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.535
MY SHOES AREN'T RIGHT,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.637
GET ON THIS TREADMILL!

16:50.143 --> 16:52.345
OH, THANK GOD.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.646
A REST.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.587
YOU KNOW, THIS THING
IS REALLY MOVING.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.988
YEAH.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.323
THAT'S NOT GOOD

17:03.390 --> 17:05.892
TO START AT
A VERY HIGH SPEED.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.327
WHY NOT?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.330
FOR ONE THING,
I COULD GET A--CRAMP!

17:10.397 --> 17:12.332
OH! A CRAMP!
RIGHT HERE.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.867

17:24.611 --> 17:25.778
OH, NO.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.649
OOH. OOH.
DARN THE LUCK.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.351
LISTEN.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.487
WE HAVE TO
TRY TO DISARM
THE BOMB OURSELVES.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.655
OKAY.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.925
CAN YOU GET THE TOP
OFF THE CONSOLE?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.793
UH...YEAH.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.395

A SCREWDRIVER BLADE

17:42.462 --> 17:45.198

ARMY KNIFE.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.102
MY BROTHER WAS
A DEMOLITIONS EXPERT

17:49.169 --> 17:51.304
IN THE UNITED STATES
MARINE CORPS.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.340
I WISH HE WAS HERE.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.376
NO. I THINK
WE'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT STUMPY.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.013
OH.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.182
THERE'S ENOUGH
EXPLOSIVES THERE

18:02.249 --> 18:03.550
TO LEVEL
THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.186

A LITTLE FAINT.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.955
DON'T WORRY,
LIEUTENANT.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.224
JUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE BOMB.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.859

WHICH WIRE TO PULL?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.527
I DIDN'T.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.595
I GUESSED.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.698
