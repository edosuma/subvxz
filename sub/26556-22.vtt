Does anyone need anything?
Do we need any water?

09:52.935 --> 09:54.044
It's very important to hydrate.

09:54.046 --> 09:56.090
No. And we don't need any snacks either.

09:56.093 --> 09:57.106
DINAH: According to the information

09:57.108 --> 09:59.113
William got on Dale's
computer, the ZETAs

09:59.116 --> 10:00.801
are marching into Star City tonight.

10:00.804 --> 10:03.206
We have to disable Archer before
they start their mass execution.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.474
RENE: That won't be easy.

10:04.476 --> 10:05.899
Archer doesn't have a server room.

10:05.902 --> 10:07.210
Its server is the actual wall

10:07.212 --> 10:08.845
outside of The Glades.

10:08.847 --> 10:11.149
Wait. The ZETAs use
Archer to track our DNA.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.419
They'll know the second we
get anywhere close to that wall.

10:13.421 --> 10:14.793
- Mom...
- Hmm?

10:14.796 --> 10:16.128
Why are you making that face?

10:16.131 --> 10:17.449
I am not making a face.

10:17.452 --> 10:19.923
This is my face.

10:19.926 --> 10:21.257
I might have put a backdoor into Archer

10:21.259 --> 10:22.692
that utilizes Queen/Smoak DNA

10:22.694 --> 10:25.061
so that you wouldn't be in the system.

10:25.063 --> 10:26.762
So you basically just erased me.

10:26.764 --> 10:27.840
I...

10:27.843 --> 10:29.398
You know, just add that
to the list of lies.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.067
I was protecting you.

10:31.069 --> 10:32.184
WILLIAM: Wait. Hold on.

10:32.187 --> 10:33.980
Yes, what she did may be overprotective

10:33.983 --> 10:35.508
- and overbearing...
- Yeah.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.641
But it could be the break
that we've been waiting for.

10:37.644 --> 10:39.809
I mean, if Archer doesn't
recognize Mia's DNA,

10:39.811 --> 10:41.511
she could be the key
to shutting it down.

10:41.513 --> 10:43.513
You're right. If Archer inputs your DNA,

10:43.515 --> 10:45.114
it theoretically creates an opening

10:45.116 --> 10:46.382
for a virus to be uploaded.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.786
I mean, I don't know if it would work.

10:47.788 --> 10:49.614
ALENA: Well, even if it
did, Archer only inputs data

10:49.616 --> 10:51.191
to its main server at one location...

10:51.194 --> 10:53.829
The checkpoint between
Star City and The Glades.

10:53.832 --> 10:54.821
That's where Dale plans

10:54.824 --> 10:56.591
to march the zetas into Star City.

10:56.594 --> 10:58.461
So we go there, we scan Mia's DNA,

10:58.463 --> 10:59.894
we upload the virus.

10:59.897 --> 11:01.681
Even with the Archer
blindspots put in place,

11:01.684 --> 11:03.129
we're way too publicly recognizable

11:03.132 --> 11:04.751
to get anywhere near that checkpoint.

11:04.754 --> 11:08.104
WILLIAM: I mean, you can't, but we can.

11:08.106 --> 11:09.605
- No.
- Uh, the... the public

11:09.607 --> 11:11.107
doesn't even know who we are.

11:11.109 --> 11:12.508
No. It is much too dangerous.

11:12.510 --> 11:15.711

my whole life for this.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.321
Any luck unscrambling
the detonation signal?

11:26.324 --> 11:28.122
FELICITY: Dinah started transmission
at the convention center.

11:28.124 --> 11:31.152
Her data plus your
data should do the trick

11:31.155 --> 11:33.019
and help us identify the targets.

11:33.022 --> 11:35.031
Okay, perfect. If we can
neutralize the rest of the Cygnus,

11:35.033 --> 11:36.730
then we can turn our
focus back to Emiko.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.152
going on here, guys,

11:44.155 --> 11:46.712
the bad news being we
just got 15 new targets.

11:46.715 --> 11:48.676
We don't have time to
neutralize that many.

11:48.679 --> 11:49.667
We might not have to.

11:49.670 --> 11:52.080
All the Cygnus devices are
linked up to the same detonator.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.536
- That was the good news, right?
- Uh-huh.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.590
Ok, well, if we destroy the detonator,

11:54.592 --> 11:56.138
we can neutralize the
rest of the targets.

12:21.886 --> 12:23.285
Look, they want to detonate

12:23.288 --> 12:25.680
the remaining devices now.

12:25.683 --> 12:27.516
That isn't the plan.

12:27.518 --> 12:28.951
The plan was only to profit

12:28.953 --> 12:30.786
on the destruction of Star City.

12:30.788 --> 12:33.856
I mean, this extra chaos is unnecessary,

12:33.858 --> 12:36.793
especially now with
the D.I.A. closing in.

12:38.773 --> 12:40.674
Chaos is the point.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.105
Without terror, there is no profit.

12:45.108 --> 12:48.522
The Circle respectfully disagrees,

12:48.525 --> 12:50.959
and they worry that your
focus on your brother

12:50.962 --> 12:52.465
has led to our exposure.

12:52.468 --> 12:55.194
Your personal vendetta is only
drawing more attention to us.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.130

13:33.883 --> 13:35.369

13:35.372 --> 13:37.591
If we try to evacuate the
civilians, we'll blow our cover.

13:37.593 --> 13:38.617
We need to find that relay trigger

13:38.619 --> 13:40.225
before the ninth

13:40.228 --> 13:42.022
Actually, just the device
relaying the signal.

13:42.024 --> 13:43.758
There's a power surge coming
from the room you're in,

13:43.760 --> 13:45.223
so the relay must be somewhere nearby.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.860
We shut down Emiko's
ability to detonate,

13:46.862 --> 13:48.397
we save the city.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.131

worried about the kids.

14:18.093 --> 14:19.327
Of course I'm worried,

14:19.330 --> 14:21.027
but I taught Zoe everything she knows

14:21.030 --> 14:22.696
about being a hero.

14:22.698 --> 14:24.064
Almost everything.
