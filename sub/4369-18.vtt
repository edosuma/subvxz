SHELBY: Previously on
 Best Friends Whenever...

00:08.549 --> 00:10.131
(BOTH SCREAMING)

00:10.131 --> 00:13.013
Janet knows
we're time travelers.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.056
She's gonna come back
and use us to give her
the power to time travel.

00:16.056 --> 00:19.060
JANET: So I created a device
 I call the tachyometer.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.273
It senses the presence
of tachyon particles.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.025
The tachyometer
also gives me the ability

00:25.025 --> 00:27.908
to remember every timeline
that I'm in.

00:27.908 --> 00:29.570
So time jump all you want.

00:29.570 --> 00:32.243
I'll remember everything.
Just like you do.

00:33.614 --> 00:35.456
Barry and Naldo are frozen!

00:35.456 --> 00:36.827
SHELBY: Are you serious?

00:36.827 --> 00:38.869
CYD: Janet's got 'em
 on display like trophies.

00:38.869 --> 00:41.752
Barry, we need you to
take away our powers
in the Future Lab.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.294
(BEEPING)

00:47.088 --> 00:48.089
It's gone.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.673
And I know that
Barry is the brains
behind all of it.

00:52.673 --> 00:54.515
So instead of
taking you two,

00:54.515 --> 00:59.100
I took him and his friend
and all their equipment.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.892
They are going to
synthesize time travel for me.

01:01.892 --> 01:04.444
And now you are powerless
to do anything about it.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.493
Janet, please,
you have to let
Barry and Naldo go!

01:12.493 --> 01:14.745
Not until they give me
the ability to time travel.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.657
They've been
trying for a year!

01:16.657 --> 01:18.329
They
don't know how!

01:18.329 --> 01:20.961
Then you'll never see them
again, so you might want to
get some new friends.

01:20.961 --> 01:24.295
Maybe through a club
or a team you can join.

01:24.295 --> 01:26.797
These are just suggestions,
you don't have to take them.

01:28.008 --> 01:30.171
We're not gonna
let you do this!

01:30.171 --> 01:32.713
There's nothing you can do.
You gave up your powers.

01:32.713 --> 01:35.556
By the way,
I never said, "Thank you."

01:35.556 --> 01:37.808
Thank you for being
a couple of idiots.

01:38.889 --> 01:40.141
You're welcome!

01:40.141 --> 01:41.522
Why would you say,
"You're welcome"?

01:41.522 --> 01:43.103
'Cause I was
brought up right!

01:44.024 --> 01:46.147
We are idiots.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.570
Every time we try
to make things better,
we make things worse.

01:49.570 --> 01:53.324
Janet was right.
We don't have our power,
there's nothing we can do.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.497
There is one person
we could go to.

01:56.497 --> 01:59.039
Shelbs, we can't.
 We don't have a choice.

01:59.039 --> 02:01.452
He's the only one
who can help us now.

02:01.452 --> 02:02.503
Make the call.

02:03.664 --> 02:05.045

So this is the guy
who's gonna help us?

02:20.761 --> 02:23.724
Hi, girls.
 Dad, there's something
we need to tell you.

02:23.724 --> 02:25.356
Janet Smythe
is evil.

02:25.356 --> 02:26.857
Everybody knows that.

02:26.857 --> 02:29.650
She makes us stay late
in order to finish our work.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.772
If you're an adult
and you hated your job

02:31.772 --> 02:33.534
you'd know
how awful that is.

02:35.115 --> 02:37.578
Dad, she's
seriously evil.

02:37.578 --> 02:41.662
She's taken Barry and Naldo
and all their equipment
and she's got them locked up!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.954
Probably in that lab with
the glowing tables
and the lasers and...

02:43.954 --> 02:45.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa! How do
you know about that?

02:45.586 --> 02:47.047
That's top secret.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.049
Which is why
we needed your
keycard to get in there.

02:49.049 --> 02:52.092
What? You guys
took my keycard?

02:52.092 --> 02:54.385
I had to lie about that.
I could've been fired!

02:54.385 --> 02:56.967
You don't understand,
she's taken
Barry and Naldo!

02:56.967 --> 03:00.391
Making up crazy stories
is only going to make
things worse.

03:00.391 --> 03:02.102
I'm very disappointed
in both of you.

03:02.102 --> 03:03.564
But Dad, I...
 Now, I'm going to be
late for work.

03:03.564 --> 03:05.226
We'll talk
about this later.

03:07.568 --> 03:08.899
Now what

you the power to time travel.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.711
Don't listen
to him, Janet.

04:10.711 --> 04:12.423
He's the smartest guy
I've ever known.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.715
If anyone can give you
the power to time
travel, it's him.

04:14.715 --> 04:16.427
Whose side
are you on?

04:16.427 --> 04:18.798
Uh, yours, Barry.
I just said you
can do it.

04:20.471 --> 04:22.683
I think
you can do it, too.

04:22.683 --> 04:25.185
You just need
the proper motivation.

04:25.185 --> 04:27.147
(BANGING ON DOOR)
 Barry!

04:27.147 --> 04:29.229
Barry!

04:29.229 --> 04:30.521
Barry!

04:36.156 --> 04:37.988
Janet, please,
you can't do this!

04:37.988 --> 04:39.950
You know what you need
to do to get him out.

04:46.457 --> 04:49.289
Okay fine! I'll do it!
I'll find a way to give you
the power to time travel!

04:49.289 --> 04:50.831
Just let
my friend out!

04:50.831 --> 04:53.003
I thought
you'd see it my way.

04:59.009 --> 05:01.682
Barry!
Thank goodness you're okay!

05:01.682 --> 05:03.594
I'm okay?
What are you talking about?

05:03.594 --> 05:05.726
Janet had you trapped
outside of a box.

05:05.726 --> 05:08.689
And I was safe in there with
a bunch of cool robot spiders.

05:08.689 --> 05:11.231
I'm so sorry you had to go
through that, Barry.

05:15.486 --> 05:18.649
There's gotta be something
in here we can use to help
Barry and Naldo.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.861
Like this
fuzzy hockey puck?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.363
Fuzzy hockey puck?

05:22.363 --> 05:24.945
I think
that's an old donut.

05:24.945 --> 05:26.537
Nope, don't know
what that is.

05:28.749 --> 05:30.290
Let's just keep looking.

05:34.254 --> 05:35.916
Cyd! Remember?

05:35.916 --> 05:39.510
The day we got blasted
by Barry's laser and turned
into time travelers,

05:39.510 --> 05:42.553
you opened that cooler,
and a beaker of blue
stuff popped out.

05:42.553 --> 05:45.135
And the laser went
through the beaker
before it hit us.

05:45.135 --> 05:48.138
That's why Barry
hasn't been able to
recreate time travel.

05:48.138 --> 05:50.060
He didn't use
the blue stuff!

05:50.060 --> 05:52.142
Janet must've
taken it with the rest
of the equipment.

05:52.142 --> 05:54.104
But she doesn't know
what it is.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.567
Shelbs, we have
the answer to time travel.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.899
We can trade that information
for Barry and Naldo.

05:58.899 --> 06:01.151
But if Janet has that power,
it leads to the future

06:01.151 --> 06:02.743
where Barry and
Naldo are frozen.

06:02.743 --> 06:05.576
It's like,
everything we do, she wins.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.748
This is why
we got rid of our power.

06:07.748 --> 06:09.079
We're not superheroes.

06:09.079 --> 06:11.452
But we have
to do something.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.164
I've got it.

06:14.164 --> 06:16.627
Let's just bust into GDD
and figure it out as we go.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.759
You mean without knowing
how we're getting in,

06:18.759 --> 06:20.921
what we're doing
when we get there,
or how we're getting out?

06:20.921 --> 06:23.003
Yes.
 That sounds like us.
Let's do it!

06:27.928 --> 06:30.140
Please, Senor Greg,
you can't leave.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.853
Bret and Chet love their
Mariachi lessons.

06:35.726 --> 06:36.857
Where's Senor Greg?

06:36.857 --> 06:39.069
I blew my horn so hard
I passed out.

06:39.069 --> 06:40.941
When I came to,
he was gone.

06:42.783 --> 06:44.905
Senor Greg can't teach
 you anymore.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.737
I guess we won't
need these now.

06:48.829 --> 06:50.370
What are you doing?

06:50.370 --> 06:51.742
Oh, sorry.

06:55.085 --> 06:56.997
What will
we do now?

06:56.997 --> 06:59.249
You're just gonna have
to find some other way
to entertain yourselves.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.713
I know what we can
do to entertain us.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.175
Let's get Barry and Naldo
to entertain us.

07:07.848 --> 07:09.890
They abandoned their
clubhouse, Chet.

07:09.890 --> 07:12.603
We can use it
for anything we want.

07:12.603 --> 07:15.145
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:15.145 --> 07:17.938
BOTH:
Trendy night club!

07:17.938 --> 07:19.860
I like the way you think.

07:25.566 --> 07:27.908
All right.
Let's do this
just like we planned.

07:27.908 --> 07:28.989
But we didn't
plan anything.

07:28.989 --> 07:30.070
Exactly.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.915
SHELBY: That was awesome!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.918
Little less awesome.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.341
Please! We need
to talk to Janet Smythe!

07:41.341 --> 07:43.714

Bret and I are playing
trendy night club.

08:05.405 --> 08:08.108
I'm the DJ.
He's the dirt bag promoter.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.281
Have fun, sweetheart.

08:12.873 --> 08:15.455
Dirtbag promoter.
That is so Bret.

08:19.209 --> 08:21.882
I brought all
the stuff to be a DJ.

08:21.882 --> 08:24.124
I brought 500 people.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.888
But our club
only holds 10 people.

08:27.888 --> 08:29.089
Exactly.

08:29.089 --> 08:31.391
The second they heard
they might not get in,

08:31.391 --> 08:32.933
they started lining up.

08:32.933 --> 08:34.895
People want what
they can't have.

08:34.895 --> 08:38.347
It's like this excellent rock
that you can't have.

08:38.347 --> 08:41.520
I want that excellent
rock so bad!
Give it to me!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.023
See what I did there?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.275
I don't care!
Give me the rock!

08:50.611 --> 08:51.742

Hi, I ordered
a grilled cheese,

08:53.493 --> 08:55.916
side of fries and a pickle
about an hour ago.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.788
Is that on
the way, or...

08:59.750 --> 09:02.753
Renaldo,
we're being held prisoner.
There's no room service.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.877
Never mind.

09:06.877 --> 09:08.929
Sorry, Barry,
what were you saying?

09:08.929 --> 09:10.170
Never mind.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.765
Cyd! Shelby!
What are you doing here?

09:14.765 --> 09:16.306
We came
to rescue you.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.098
But first,
what's the status
of those fries?

09:18.098 --> 09:20.560
Are those
for the table, or...

09:21.892 --> 09:23.103
Enough!

09:23.103 --> 09:24.564
I brought you
to your friends.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.897
Now it's time to
hold up your end
of the bargain.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.649
Tell me the secret
to time travel.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.611
They don't know
the secret to time travel.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.953
Actually, Barry,
we figured it out.

09:32.953 --> 09:34.284
You figured
out time travel?

09:34.284 --> 09:35.656
You guys?
 Yup.

09:35.656 --> 09:36.957
The ones who don't know
the difference between

09:36.957 --> 09:38.789
quantum tunneling
and quantum coupling?

09:38.789 --> 09:39.960
Yeah, that's us.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.411
When they own their
limitations like that,

09:41.411 --> 09:42.793
it's very hard
to insult them.

09:44.464 --> 09:47.507
So tell me.
How does it work?

09:47.507 --> 09:49.049
Let our
friends go first.

09:49.049 --> 09:51.341
No. You tell me the secret,
then I let them go.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.383
You let them go,
then we tell you.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.846
It looks like we have
ourselves a standoff.

09:57.638 --> 09:58.719
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:03.063 --> 10:06.106
Club Brother and Brother
is Portland's trendiest club,

10:06.106 --> 10:08.318
and I'm the reason
it's so successful.

10:09.149 --> 10:12.152
No, I am.

10:12.152 --> 10:16.536
They come to Club Brother
and Brother for my fresh beats
and excellent rock.

10:18.538 --> 10:21.621
People come because I'm an
unstoppable hype machine.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.164
That's why I'm the "brother"
in Brother and Brother.

10:25.585 --> 10:27.007
You're a jerk face.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.629
They should call
this place Jerk face
and Jerk face.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.672
You just called
yourself a jerk face.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.554
It was worth it.

10:34.554 --> 10:37.517
You know what?
I don't want to play
trendy night club anymore.

10:37.517 --> 10:38.809
I quit.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.681
You can't quit
'cause you're fired!

10:40.681 --> 10:42.432
I just hired a new DJ.

10:42.432 --> 10:45.145
His name's DJ
My-Phone-On-Shuffle!

10:48.528 --> 10:49.730
You ruined the club!

10:49.730 --> 10:51.822
You ruined the club!

10:51.822 --> 10:53.864
What is going on?

10:53.864 --> 10:58.118
Chet's diva-like
behavior is alienating
our exclusive clientele!

10:58.118 --> 10:59.619
Bret's being a butt!

11:02.202 --> 11:05.415
Boys, whatever game
you're playing,
it's not worth fighting over.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.998
Nothing should
come between you.
You're brothers.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.050
No pretend night
club can change that.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.053
You're right, Mom.

11:13.053 --> 11:15.215
I'm sorry, Chet.
I was being a butt.

11:15.215 --> 11:16.847
And I'm sorry, too, Bret.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.889
I wasn't listening
to what you just said.

11:24.064 --> 11:26.436
Tell me the secret
to time travel.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.898
Is it a process?

11:27.898 --> 11:29.900
A formula? An object?

11:29.900 --> 11:32.442
Ah-ha! You looked at each
other! It's an object!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.274
Gah, why'd we
look at each other?

11:34.274 --> 11:37.407
Whatever else she says,
we can't look
at each other.

11:37.407 --> 11:39.409
Is it something
in this room?

11:39.409 --> 11:40.741
Ah-ha!
It is in this room!

11:40.741 --> 11:41.822
BOTH: Gah!

11:43.583 --> 11:45.916
So it's something
in this room.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.208
But what?

11:48.208 --> 11:51.922
Boy, if I knew what it was,
I'd have a hard time
not looking at it right now.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.504
Nothing you say is gonna make
us look at that blue beaker...

11:54.504 --> 11:55.926
Yes, I know
what I just did.

11:56.676 --> 11:58.008
The blue beaker!

12:00.390 --> 12:02.682
Take them
to Level Nine.

12:02.682 --> 12:05.766
They've volunteered to be
test subjects in our new
suspended animation program.

12:08.648 --> 12:11.401
Ms. Smythe, I need
your signature on...

12:11.401 --> 12:13.153
What are you
kids doing here?

12:13.153 --> 12:15.776
Ms. Smythe,
I am so sorry if they
snuck in again.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.447
Dad! Janet's crazy!

12:17.447 --> 12:19.659
She's gonna freeze us
in suspended animation!

12:19.659 --> 12:21.031
Shelby, enough
with your stories!

12:21.031 --> 12:22.532
Freeze him, too!
 Say what now?

12:24.074 --> 12:25.826
Don't anybody move

12:25.826 --> 12:28.418
or I will delete
break room bagels
from the company budget!

12:28.418 --> 12:31.331
Don't test me!
I'm just crazy enough
to do it!

12:32.793 --> 12:34.584
Just get him!
Get all of them!

12:34.584 --> 12:36.216
No! Leave my kids alone!
 (SCREAMS)

12:36.216 --> 12:37.677
(GRUNTS)

12:40.470 --> 12:42.182
Shelby, I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

12:42.973 --> 12:44.474
(STRAINING)

12:46.146 --> 12:48.058
Can we get more
security in here?

12:48.058 --> 12:50.891
Preferably someone who can
fight off a man with a chair?

12:53.193 --> 12:54.694
How are we gonna
get out of here?

12:54.694 --> 12:55.695
There's only one way.

13:10.871 --> 13:12.833
We did it!
It's two days ago.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.255
We're back to before
Janet ransacked the RV
and took Barry and Naldo.

13:15.255 --> 13:16.796
But we got
our powers back.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.589
The whole point was
to get rid of it to
protect our friends.

13:19.589 --> 13:21.681
This stupid time travel
has messed up everything.

13:21.681 --> 13:23.263
What were we
supposed to do, Shelby?

13:23.263 --> 13:25.265
We were trapped
in the Future Lab.

13:26.596 --> 13:28.558
Guys, I'm so glad
you're okay.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.350
Me, too.
I love being okay.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.523
Why wouldn't
we be okay?

13:33.523 --> 13:37.277
Oh, no, what time-tastrophe
did you two create now?

13:37.277 --> 13:39.069
Now, did that work?
Time-tastrophe?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.530
I was gonna say
ca-time-strophe,

13:40.530 --> 13:42.532
but time-tastrophe
is easier to understand.

13:44.034 --> 13:46.116
Cyd, I just remembered...

13:46.116 --> 13:47.707
Janet has the tachyometer!

13:47.707 --> 13:50.370
She's gonna remember
everything we did!

13:52.913 --> 13:55.335
I remember
everything you did.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.629
What?
Did someone just say that?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.928
That's right,

14:07.928 --> 14:10.971
I remembered everything
from our little face-off in my
lab in the future.

14:10.971 --> 14:12.772
So I stopped by
Barry's RV

14:12.772 --> 14:16.146
and got what I need
to give myself
the power of time travel.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.237
(SNAPS FINGERS)

14:19.609 --> 14:21.071
Is that
from my lab?

14:21.071 --> 14:23.443
Yeah, we figured out
the secret to time travel.

14:23.443 --> 14:25.115
We did it!

14:25.115 --> 14:26.486
Actually, Barry,
you weren't involved in...
 I said we did it!

14:28.618 --> 14:32.332
I'm gonna get the power
right here just to see
the looks on your faces.

14:32.332 --> 14:34.084
We're not gonna
let you do this.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.875
What're you gonna do
to stop me?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.588
Everything you've tried
has brought me
closer to this moment.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.590
You left the tachyons
in my garage,

14:40.590 --> 14:42.382
you told me you were
time travelers,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.174
you gave me
the secret to time travel.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.346
You don't deserve
this power. I do.

14:46.346 --> 14:47.637
Charge up the laser!

14:49.099 --> 14:50.270
What?

14:50.270 --> 14:52.432
Fine, move everything
closer to the outlet.

14:52.432 --> 14:54.644
All because Phil forgot
the extension cord!

14:56.776 --> 14:59.149
Everything we've done
has made it worse.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.520
You were right, Shelby.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.153
We have our power back,
but there's nothing we can do.

15:04.324 --> 15:05.735
It's over.

15:05.735 --> 15:07.117
We've lost.

15:10.991 --> 15:14.124
Maybe it won't work on Janet.
She doesn't have someone
to time travel with.

15:14.124 --> 15:15.455
She's going to
zap herself.

15:15.455 --> 15:17.587
She'll be a
single time traveler.

15:17.587 --> 15:19.249
Aw, Barry, don't say that.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.342
I'm sure
there's plenty of eligible
time travelers out there.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.634
I know there's not,
but I don't want her
to feel hopeless.

15:41.401 --> 15:43.153
Let's see.

15:43.153 --> 15:44.484
Where do
I go first?

15:44.484 --> 15:48.068
I know, I'll jump back
and keep you two
from ever meeting.

15:48.068 --> 15:52.032
Then you'll never
be friends and you'll
never interfere with me again!

15:52.032 --> 15:53.533
Say goodbye
to each other.

15:57.337 --> 15:58.999
Shelbs, what are
we gonna do?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.710
We can't
lose each other.

16:01.671 --> 16:02.752
Then let's fight back.

16:03.543 --> 16:04.584
(GRUNTS)

16:08.508 --> 16:09.849
(BUZZING)

16:13.513 --> 16:15.355
What's happening?
What are you doing?

16:15.355 --> 16:16.686
It's called "jump jamming!"

16:16.686 --> 16:17.977
You're not
going anywhere!

16:20.190 --> 16:21.691
You can't stop me!

16:21.691 --> 16:23.813
Don't listen to her, Shelbs!
We can do this!

16:26.196 --> 16:28.278
Renaldo, this is a hugely
dangerous situation.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.989
The convergence of three
different tachyon sources

16:29.989 --> 16:32.702
has the potential to create
a thermo-tachyal explosion.

16:32.702 --> 16:34.074
So we should get
everyone out of here.

16:34.074 --> 16:36.746
Yes, and preferably
3,000 miles away.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.747
And in space.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.170
Then we better hurry.

16:41.881 --> 16:43.543
(RUMBLING)

16:52.512 --> 16:54.304
Listen, I know
this is fascinating.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.517
You are witnessing
the universe's first ever
time travelers' duel.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.140
This is likely
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

17:00.140 --> 17:03.773
Barry. Space?

17:03.773 --> 17:07.487
Right, of course.
Those who want to live,
follow me.

17:07.487 --> 17:09.199
And the rest of you,
follow me.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.824
Let's see
how you handle this!

17:20.960 --> 17:23.963
She's too strong!
 Shelby, don't give up.

17:23.963 --> 17:25.464
We can
do this together.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.347
(EXPLOSION)

17:43.563 --> 17:45.355
Cyd, are you okay?

17:46.186 --> 17:47.987
Yeah, I'm okay.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.360
I can't jump!

17:50.360 --> 17:52.282
My power's been drained!

17:52.282 --> 17:53.453
Get them!

18:01.331 --> 18:02.832
(GRUNTING)

18:14.804 --> 18:16.266
(GRUNTING CONTINUES)

18:22.812 --> 18:24.224
Who are they?

18:24.224 --> 18:25.815
They're awesome!

18:31.361 --> 18:33.783
Cyd. I think that's...

18:33.783 --> 18:35.735
No. It can't be.

18:35.735 --> 18:39.329
Did we just take out a room
full of Janet Smythe's guards?

18:39.329 --> 18:40.790
I think we did!

18:42.202 --> 18:43.703
Oh, yeah, that's us.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.169
Don't freak out,
but your battle with Janet
opened a time rift.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.800
We came through
it to help you.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.752
Thanks, Future Shelby.

18:52.752 --> 18:54.884
Actually, I just
go by Shelby.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.095
Hey, me too!

18:57.387 --> 18:59.849
So you're what
we become some day?

18:59.849 --> 19:01.431
Your future
isn't written.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.683
We're just
one possibility.

19:03.683 --> 19:08.478
And if a guy in a chipmunk
costume asks you if you
can watch the door to a bank,

19:08.478 --> 19:09.689
just say no.

19:09.689 --> 19:11.571
Did you say, "Yes"?
 Just say, "No!"

19:14.073 --> 19:16.196
I'm gonna destroy you.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.579
(GRUNTING)

19:19.579 --> 19:21.080
(JANET SCREAMING)

19:27.707 --> 19:29.209
We'll take it
from here.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.090
We've got a place
for people like her.

19:31.090 --> 19:32.882
Is it time jail?

19:32.882 --> 19:35.345
Well, we just call it jail,

19:35.345 --> 19:36.716
but you could
call it time jail.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.389
I can't tell if that's
friendly or condescending.

19:39.389 --> 19:42.061
Classic me! (CHUCKLES)

19:42.061 --> 19:46.105
It's probably safer
if we take the
blue beaker with us.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.067
Also, once the rift
seals behind us,

19:48.067 --> 19:52.071
the timeline will reset
and no one else will remember
anything that happened.

19:52.071 --> 19:53.573
See you around.

19:53.573 --> 19:55.735
You guys are
cool buttons.

19:55.735 --> 19:56.946
That's future slang.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.868
No it's not,
don't mess with them!

20:09.749 --> 20:12.502
I can't believe
everything's back to normal.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.296
I can't believe we finally
stopped Janet Smythe.

20:16.296 --> 20:17.427
What do we do now?

20:17.427 --> 20:18.968
I mean,
we still have our powers.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.720
Should we get Barry
to take them away again?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.973
Shelbs, we took down
a supervillain.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.516
And you know
how we did it?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.898
Yeah, I know,
with time travel.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.230
No, with each other.

20:32.061 --> 20:34.444
That's our super power.

20:34.444 --> 20:35.905
Our friendship.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.907
Cyd.

20:37.907 --> 20:41.281
That is the cheesiest thing
either of us has ever said
and it came out of your mouth.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.664
I'm serious.

20:44.664 --> 20:46.866
When the whole world
was against us...

20:46.866 --> 20:48.538
Janet had our friends,

20:48.538 --> 20:50.249
your dad
didn't believe us,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.211
we didn't even
have our powers...

20:52.872 --> 20:55.214
We had each other.

20:55.214 --> 20:58.718
I couldn't have done
any of this stuff
without you.

20:58.718 --> 21:01.681
I never could've done any
of this stuff without you.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.303
And you'll
never have to.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.475
'Cause
we're cool buttons.

21:05.475 --> 21:07.647
You know, Future Me
made it very clear

21:07.647 --> 21:10.149
that's not
really a thing.

21:10.149 --> 21:11.851
But we're gonna
make it a thing.

21:13.813 --> 21:15.104
Together.

21:26.746 --> 21:29.409
So the blue beaker
was the secret all along?

21:29.409 --> 21:31.411
I don't even remember
having a blue beaker in here.

21:31.411 --> 21:32.912
It was
in that cooler.

21:32.912 --> 21:35.084
Wait, that was
my homemade hair gel!

21:35.084 --> 21:38.798
Wow. Naldo's hair gel
was the key to
cracking time travel.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.421
It's also the key
to manageable hair.

21:41.421 --> 21:44.684
Renaldo, we must synthesize
a new batch immediately!
What was in it?

21:44.684 --> 21:46.426
I remember exactly
how I made it.

21:46.426 --> 21:47.847
It was green...
 It was blue.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.980
Then I have no idea
how I made it.

21:50.980 --> 21:54.564
Wow, I can't believe
we're finally done
with the Future Lab.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.275
Don't get too
comfortable, Shelbs.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.197
We're still
time travelers.

21:58.197 --> 21:59.899
You know
we'll get ourselves into
something else crazy.

21:59.899 --> 22:01.901
Well, we'll handle it, Cyd.

22:01.901 --> 22:03.032
Whatever it is.
