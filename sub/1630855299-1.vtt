[Indiscernible] [Gasps]

01:19.631 --> 01:21.633
Sober up, lock everything.

01:23.255 --> 01:24.394
I don't think we
were followed.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.227
Focus-focus, I got to go
back,

01:29.261 --> 01:30.504
try to unfuck this mess.

01:30.538 --> 01:33.472
You stay in, keep
the lights off.

01:33.507 --> 01:36.268
Shit, just find the damn
safe;

01:36.303 --> 01:38.132
be ready to go when I get back.

01:44.242 --> 01:46.485
What-what?

01:46.692 --> 01:49.419
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.354
Hey big fella, hey,

01:53.596 --> 01:54.942
Come on, wake
up, wakey wake.

You got this, come on.

01:56.668 --> 02:00.706

02:03.502 --> 02:04.503
[breathes heavily]

02:04.538 --> 02:06.712
Okay, buddy, you'll find
this when you wake up.

02:09.681 --> 02:11.200
Oh, good-good.

02:12.201 --> 02:12.925
I'll be back.

02:22.625 --> 02:27.147
[Breathes heavily]
Oh, uh, Jack?

02:28.493 --> 02:29.425
Hello?

02:33.222 --> 02:36.846

Uh, uh, ah, uh
[Breathes heavily].

03:06.289 --> 03:07.325
What happened?

03:07.601 --> 03:17.266
Oh [Breathes heavily].

03:34.490 --> 03:37.389
Come on, come on,

05:54.940 --> 05:56.183
Sorry, did I just
spook you there?

05:56.217 --> 05:57.391
Just being nosey neighbors.

05:57.978 --> 05:58.772
Hi.

06:13.718 --> 06:14.581
We're so sorry.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.548
We heard yelling, we
knocked, but --

06:16.583 --> 06:17.722
[Laughs] We thought
someone was hurt.

06:18.516 --> 06:20.587
Oh, uh, I'm
sorry about that.

06:20.621 --> 06:22.761
I, um -- I hurt my hand.

06:22.796 --> 06:23.659
Uh-huh.

06:25.005 --> 06:25.833
Ben Rakes.

06:25.868 --> 06:26.800
Lisa.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.629
And this is my arm-candy,
Ted. [Laughs]

06:28.664 --> 06:29.423
Join us on the
porch for a

06:29.458 --> 06:31.529
get-to-know-you-drink,
neighbor?

06:31.563 --> 06:33.565
Oh, that's -- it's really nice,

06:33.600 --> 06:34.635
and I-I don't wanna be rude.

06:34.670 --> 06:35.602
Then don't be.

06:35.636 --> 06:36.775
Moving in without meeting
the neighbors

06:36.810 --> 06:37.776
doesn't fly here.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.675
[Laughs] I promise we
aren't total hicks.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.641
[Laughs]

06:40.676 --> 06:44.749
[Laughs] Yeah, all right.

06:44.783 --> 06:45.715
All right.
All right.

06:45.750 --> 06:46.958
[Laughs]

06:48.477 --> 06:49.892
[Laughs]

06:53.930 --> 06:56.726
Oh, we're sorry about
all all the barking.

06:56.761 --> 06:57.969
We rescue strays,
and then get pissed

06:58.003 --> 06:59.833
when mommy and daddy
aren't home.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.634
Oh, that's what all
the yelling was about.

07:07.668 --> 07:08.635
Rough moving day?

07:08.669 --> 07:11.534
Uh, yeah.

07:12.293 --> 07:13.640
I don't really know
how that happened.

07:15.607 --> 07:16.781
Appreciate the distraction.

07:18.783 --> 07:21.475
It's been a strange night.

07:21.510 --> 07:22.890
[Laughs] I'm sorry if we
made it any stranger,

07:22.925 --> 07:24.616
we're a few in already.

07:24.789 --> 07:26.756
Oh, don't scare him away,
he just bought the place.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.517
Actually, this is my
father's place.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.657
Hmm, invite him to come
down and join us.

07:30.691 --> 07:32.900
[Laughs] Does he
nurse his beers like you?

07:32.935 --> 07:37.664
He died two weeks ago,
car accident.

07:37.698 --> 07:38.906
Oh, shit.

07:38.941 --> 07:40.736
Ben, I am so sorry.

07:40.770 --> 07:41.944
Uh, it's all right.

07:45.672 --> 07:48.537
Seriously, it's-it's
fine, we weren't close.

07:49.538 --> 07:50.470
He traveled a lot for
work,

07:50.504 --> 07:52.092
and I wasn't great at
keeping in touch.

07:52.817 --> 07:54.888
I didn't know he retired up
here till after he passed.

07:55.095 --> 07:59.548
Uh-huh, well, I'm sure Arthur
is happy you got the place.

07:59.789 --> 08:01.791
Sorry, I didn't realize
you knew him.

08:01.826 --> 08:02.930
Oh, we didn't.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.587
Uh, car accident
was in the paper.

08:04.622 --> 08:05.830
Not much news in
this small town,

08:05.864 --> 08:07.728
I can't believe we
never met him.

08:08.557 --> 08:10.593
Yeah, it's-it's weird.

08:10.973 --> 08:11.767
I think --.

08:11.801 --> 08:13.596
[Laughs] Shit, you got
a big one.

08:13.631 --> 08:14.321
Ted?

08:14.355 --> 08:16.012
Oh, sorry.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.704
Hey, I'm sorry
for your loss.

08:18.118 --> 08:19.706
We're just happy to
meet a new neighbor.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.019
This is temporary,

08:23.054 --> 08:26.091
I'm just here to sort
through his things,

08:26.126 --> 08:27.679
settle his affairs.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.819
And soon as I'm done
I'm heading out.

08:29.854 --> 08:32.615
Can't be that bad being
back in your hometown?

08:32.891 --> 08:36.550
I grew up with my mom;
it's my first time here.

08:36.585 --> 08:38.690
But your father, his
family was from here.

08:38.725 --> 08:40.036
I don't know, could be.

08:40.071 --> 08:42.556
[Laughs] Lisa likes to
play town historian.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.006
Well, why would his
father retire here

08:44.040 --> 08:45.663
if he wasn't from here?

08:45.697 --> 08:47.837
Like I said, I wasn't great
at keeping in touch.

08:47.872 --> 08:49.114
Well, maybe we knew
your grandfather.

08:49.149 --> 08:50.081
What was his name?

08:50.115 --> 08:51.082
I never met him.

08:51.116 --> 08:52.773
Well, you know his name.

08:52.808 --> 08:54.016
Uh, Grandpa Rakes.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.087
[Laughs] Uh, like
I said, I-I never met him.

08:56.121 --> 08:57.157
Think for a second.

08:59.815 --> 09:01.817
Too intense,
[laughs] sorry,

09:01.851 --> 09:03.991
I just get really excited
about history.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.959
[Laughs] It's all good, yeah;

09:05.993 --> 09:07.167
I wish you could tell me more.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.894
Uh, we need more beer.

09:09.928 --> 09:10.895
Yes.

09:10.929 --> 09:12.586
Uh, well, my father kept
some in the fridge,

09:12.621 --> 09:14.001
uh, you can help yourself.

09:16.003 --> 09:18.834
You know, come to our house,
we got tons of drinks.

09:20.767 --> 09:24.943
You know, nah, it's-it's
been a long night.

09:24.978 --> 09:27.049
We're just to those trees,
come over for one drink.

09:31.018 --> 09:34.366
Full disclosure,
I don't drink.

09:34.953 --> 09:37.059
I shouldn't have let
you open this one.

09:37.922 --> 09:39.820
Uh, time to call it a night.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.030
Sorry for the beers, uh,
come over for a snack,

09:43.065 --> 09:44.066
just meet the doggies.

09:45.723 --> 09:46.068
Tomorrow.

09:47.069 --> 09:49.071
What, our house isn't
good enough for you?

09:49.899 --> 09:51.211
What? No-no,
it's nothing like that.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.315
Hey, shut up, Ted.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.180
Ben, just come, don't
leave me with this drunk.

09:55.767 --> 09:57.976
[Laughs] Come
on, don't be a dick, Ben.

09:58.149 --> 09:59.219
It's not a big deal.

10:00.289 --> 10:02.809
You know what, and nothing
personal, but, uh-uh

10:02.843 --> 10:05.052
I think we just call it
goodnight now.

10:07.158 --> 10:10.610
What, you afraid
of the dark, Ben?

10:12.681 --> 10:13.820
There's nothing out here.

10:16.477 --> 10:17.133
Okay.

10:18.997 --> 10:19.929
Nothing out here.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.831
He's right, there's
nothing to be scared of.

10:26.246 --> 10:27.040
Goodnight, Lisa.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.318
Ben!

10:30.353 --> 10:32.010
Ben!

10:38.292 --> 10:43.056
[Breathes heavily]

10:57.760 --> 10:58.796
Jack?

10:58.830 --> 10:59.797
Hey, can you hear me?

10:59.831 --> 11:00.867
Jack, what the hell's going on?

11:00.901 --> 11:02.800
Can you hear me?

11:02.834 --> 11:03.801
Jack?

11:03.835 --> 11:05.872
Did you find it?

11:05.906 --> 11:07.701
Jack, you're breaking up.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.910
God damn it, fucking phones.

11:09.945 --> 11:11.222
Jack?

11:11.256 --> 11:12.879
Yeah, hold on.

11:19.264 --> 11:20.024
Jack?

11:20.058 --> 11:20.887
Fuck.

11:20.921 --> 11:22.095
Jack, what's happening?
Where are you?

11:22.129 --> 11:23.993
Listen, it's bad here.

11:24.028 --> 11:24.994
Wa-what's happening?

11:25.029 --> 11:26.893
The sheriff is helping
them out search houses.

11:26.927 --> 11:28.515
I ain't see the black car.

11:28.549 --> 11:29.378
What? Why?

11:29.412 --> 11:31.035
Fuck, they're coming
towards the car.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.726
Look, uh, I got to hide.

11:32.761 --> 11:35.073
Jack, are you all right, Jack?

11:36.868 --> 11:37.766
Shit.

11:54.058 --> 11:56.025
Jack-Jack, are you there?

11:56.060 --> 11:57.268
Yeah-yeah,
I -- I'm good for now.

11:57.302 --> 11:59.166
You lied to me,
you son of a bitch.

11:59.201 --> 12:00.754
Talk to me, Jack.

12:00.789 --> 12:02.825
I drove six hours
to come here,

12:02.860 --> 12:03.999
you told me you were sober,

12:04.033 --> 12:05.828
promised me
you could handle this.

12:05.863 --> 12:08.935
I am sober, I swear.

12:09.245 --> 12:10.074
Yeah.

12:10.971 --> 12:12.559
Look, I was waiting for
you at the bar,

12:12.593 --> 12:18.185
I ordered dinner, and then
I can't remember.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.980
Yeah, well, you were
hammered when I got there.

12:20.015 --> 12:21.119
That can't be.

12:21.154 --> 12:24.157
You were outta control,
fighting two racist hicks.

12:24.191 --> 12:25.952
Now, you know what happens
with people like you in

12:25.986 --> 12:26.987
this kinda town.

12:28.092 --> 12:29.887
Well, you broke your hand
shattering a guy's jaw.

12:29.921 --> 12:32.027
For Christ sake, I barely
got you out of the bar.

12:32.061 --> 12:32.855
Shit.

12:33.960 --> 12:34.961
So, I came back, I thought
I could talk to someone,

12:34.995 --> 12:36.894
calm things down, but
they're acting crazy.

12:36.928 --> 12:37.273
Who?

12:37.308 --> 12:38.274
Everyone.

12:38.309 --> 12:40.035
Looks like half the
town is looking for you.

12:40.069 --> 12:41.588
I've never seen
anything like this before.

12:41.622 --> 12:42.934
We've gotta get out of here.

12:42.969 --> 12:44.315
We can't leave
until I find the money.

12:44.349 --> 12:46.075
You haven't
found the safe yet?

12:46.110 --> 12:47.076
Not yet.

12:47.111 --> 12:48.871
Look, just get back
here and help me look.

12:48.906 --> 12:51.184
Look, these guys are
serious about hurting you.

12:51.218 --> 12:52.357
Welcome to my world.

12:52.392 --> 12:53.462
Just get back here, please.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.602
Yeah-yeah-yeah, when I'm
sure they can't follow me.

12:55.636 --> 12:56.396
Look, you stay hidden.

12:56.430 --> 13:00.124
Christ almighty --
oh, shit --

13:01.297 --> 13:03.541
Jack... Jack?

13:03.955 --> 13:08.132
[Breathes heavily]
Shit.

13:42.373 --> 13:43.615
Fuck this town.

13:51.175 --> 14:02.393
[Exhales deeply]
All right, come on,

14:02.427 --> 14:07.294
Mr. Safe, where are you?

14:34.114 --> 14:35.219
Hello?

14:43.365 --> 14:44.469
Somebody here?

15:34.140 --> 15:35.348
You've got to be kidding me.

15:56.024 --> 15:57.163
Oh, hell no.

16:00.821 --> 16:06.034
Hey-hey, the fuck you doing?

16:09.485 --> 16:10.452
I'm talking to you.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.188
Putting a
scarecrow in the field.

16:23.154 --> 16:24.328
Yeah, and who
told you to do that?

16:26.054 --> 16:27.124
Arthur.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.472
Arthur is dead, man.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.993
Still paid me to do it.

16:35.063 --> 16:37.375
Well, this is my house now,
and I'm telling you

16:37.410 --> 16:39.067
I don't want the scarecrow.

16:39.481 --> 16:41.172
Well, you're welcome to
pay me to take it down,

16:41.207 --> 16:43.071
might have an
opening next week.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.385
[Exhales deeply]
Who are you?

16:47.420 --> 16:50.802
Mason, people need things
done around here they call me.

16:51.872 --> 16:55.393
Well, Mason, I'm gonna need
you to take that scarecrow

16:55.428 --> 16:56.532
and fuck off.

16:57.119 --> 16:58.845
Arthur paid me
for a scarecrow,

16:58.879 --> 17:00.019
I'm gonna put it up.

17:01.158 --> 17:04.471
Or you can come down out
of that house and

17:04.506 --> 17:06.197
hit me with that bat.

17:06.232 --> 17:08.199
This fun to you,
fucking with me?

17:08.234 --> 17:09.649
Just giving you
options, tough guy.

17:09.683 --> 17:11.409
Is this really how you
want your night to go?

17:12.376 --> 17:17.657
Come here; attack
me with your bat.

17:25.596 --> 17:26.597
Okay.

17:27.149 --> 17:28.564
Okay, Mason, put
up your scarecrow,

17:29.910 --> 17:35.537
I'll enjoy
watching you work for me.

18:03.703 --> 18:05.118
What the hell?

18:12.712 --> 18:14.127
Jack Attack Boxing.

18:14.162 --> 18:15.163
Leave a message.

18:16.164 --> 18:19.132
Jack, where are you, man,
[exhales deeply]

18:19.167 --> 18:20.720
shit is getting way
too crazy out here.

18:51.613 --> 18:52.579
Hello?

19:03.211 --> 19:04.453
Hello?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.641
Well, you better believe I'm
not in the mood for this shit.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.746
Who the fuck is in my house?

19:21.781 --> 19:22.644
Go away.

19:22.678 --> 19:23.610
Go away?

19:23.645 --> 19:25.198
This is my house,
who the fuck are you?

19:25.233 --> 19:25.923
Arthur's friend.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.959
You're trespassing.
Go away.

19:29.237 --> 19:32.792
[Sobs]
Okay, Arthur's friend,

19:33.793 --> 19:36.623
I'm Ben Rakes, Arthur's son.

19:37.037 --> 19:38.694
Bullshit, Arthur
didn't have a son.

19:38.729 --> 19:40.420
We weren't close.

19:40.455 --> 19:41.697
I'm not surprised he
didn't mention me.

19:41.732 --> 19:43.665
But he did leave
the house to me.

19:43.699 --> 19:46.806
Come on, how many black
guys come through this town?

19:48.773 --> 19:51.500
What was your mother's name?

19:52.398 --> 19:53.537
Ellie Rakes.

20:04.410 --> 20:06.412
You're like
twice Arthur's size.

20:07.654 --> 20:09.277
Ellie fed me well.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.313
Look, I'm not
trying to scare you;

20:11.348 --> 20:13.626
I just wanna know
what's going on here.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.388
Think of me as a skunk, I
won't make it stink

20:17.423 --> 20:19.252
if you don't mess with me.

20:19.287 --> 20:20.080
I'm not gonna mess with you;

20:20.115 --> 20:21.461
I didn't even know
you'd be here.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.670
Okay, all right.

20:23.705 --> 20:25.258
Let's just, uh -- Move.

20:25.293 --> 20:26.259
Well, where you going?

20:26.294 --> 20:27.536
I have to pee.

20:27.571 --> 20:28.710
Flashlight?

20:32.438 --> 20:33.646
And make sure you
put the tap on.

20:35.337 --> 20:37.512
I've been hiding up here since
your friend dragged you in.

20:38.582 --> 20:39.548
Who are you?

20:39.583 --> 20:40.446
Amy.

20:41.343 --> 20:42.551
Your dad was part of the
seniors' club

20:42.586 --> 20:43.863
I run at the library.

20:44.381 --> 20:45.174
Seniors' club?

20:45.209 --> 20:48.316
Yeah, uh, a-a
club for seniors.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.697
There's a lot of resources
in town for older folks,

20:50.732 --> 20:52.837
so volunteers check up on them

20:52.872 --> 20:56.289
and take them to the
library and stuff.

20:56.324 --> 20:58.567
Your dad gave me
keys, by the way.

20:58.602 --> 20:59.568
I didn't break in.

20:59.603 --> 21:01.536
Yeah, but why are you
hiding in his house?

21:01.570 --> 21:02.744
I thought it was empty.

21:04.504 --> 21:08.267
I'm sorry about
your dad passing.

21:08.888 --> 21:10.338
He-he was a nice guy.

21:10.372 --> 21:12.063
Just tell me why you're here.

21:17.137 --> 21:18.622
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

21:18.794 --> 21:19.761
Bit late for that.

21:19.795 --> 21:20.796
Just tell me.

21:23.351 --> 21:24.524
Were you in town?

21:24.938 --> 21:27.320
Did-did you notice
people acting weird?

21:27.355 --> 21:27.907
Weird?

21:30.634 --> 21:33.533
And it's been weird
for about two weeks,

21:33.568 --> 21:36.847
it's always at night,
screams in the woods,

21:36.881 --> 21:38.504
people are setting fires.

21:40.782 --> 21:42.646
Two people went missing today.

21:42.922 --> 21:43.785
Shit.

21:44.993 --> 21:47.858
So, I just thought I'd come
out of town and hide here

21:47.892 --> 21:49.342
before it got dark.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.794
I have some bad news for you;

21:52.828 --> 21:54.658
here is the last
place you wanna be.

21:54.934 --> 21:56.107
Why?

21:57.039 --> 21:58.040
I don't know about
the last two weeks,

21:58.075 --> 22:01.320
but tonight, I got some
folks looking for me.

22:01.596 --> 22:05.565
Looking for you,
what did you do?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.808
I don't know.

22:06.842 --> 22:12.745
Jack says I won a bar fight
against the wrong white guy.

22:12.779 --> 22:16.473
Oh, Jesus Christ.

22:16.507 --> 22:17.922
Who's Jack?

22:17.957 --> 22:19.130
A friend.

22:20.235 --> 22:23.928
He's the guy who brought
me here after the bar, uh.

22:23.963 --> 22:25.861
Look, you should go.

22:25.896 --> 22:27.553
Well, I-I didn't drive here,

22:27.587 --> 22:29.934
and I'm not walking
in the dark, so.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.522
Jesus.

22:31.557 --> 22:35.388
Oh shit, shit.

23:07.247 --> 23:09.767
[Breathes heavily] Oh.

23:09.802 --> 23:11.459
That motherfucker.

23:12.667 --> 23:13.840
What is that?

23:13.875 --> 23:15.842
I think my old
pal Mason is back.

23:15.877 --> 23:18.742
Wait-wait, Mason
Banks is here?

23:18.776 --> 23:20.537
You know that asshole?

23:20.571 --> 23:23.885
Shit, don't make him
angry, he's dangerous.

23:23.919 --> 23:25.818
Pretty sure I just
knocked out his buddy.

23:25.852 --> 23:28.579
No, I'm-I'm being serious,
I've seen him hurt people.

23:28.614 --> 23:30.581
He's probably on
something, he's fucked up.

23:30.616 --> 23:32.825
[Breathes heavily]
He's probably just an asshole.

23:32.859 --> 23:34.861
[Breathes heavily]

23:34.896 --> 23:34.999
[Breathes heavily]
He's probably just an asshole.

23:40.177 --> 23:40.971
Listen to me,

23:41.937 --> 23:43.560
don't go out there,
it's what he wants.

23:43.594 --> 23:45.596
How's your buddy's
jaw doing, Mason?

23:47.771 --> 23:50.670
Hold this; I don't
wanna break it too.

23:50.705 --> 23:51.913
Don't.

23:54.709 --> 23:55.641
Close the door.

23:56.918 --> 23:57.815
Close the door.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.058
Oh darn.

24:03.787 --> 24:04.822
Come here, Mason.

24:07.756 --> 24:08.964
[Screams] Come here.

25:34.740 --> 25:39.607
[Breathes heavily]
[rumbling]

25:48.650 --> 25:51.204
[banging]

25:58.971 --> 26:01.042
[knocking]

26:02.250 --> 26:04.977
[bangs]

26:10.672 --> 26:16.264
[incessant knocking]

26:16.713 --> 26:17.955
[screams]

26:19.785 --> 26:20.958
Got you [laughs].

26:21.856 --> 26:28.172
Oh, fuck, Ted,
what the fuck?

26:28.932 --> 26:31.900
What the fuck is right,
what is this spooky thing?

26:32.901 --> 26:33.902
And why are you here?

26:33.937 --> 26:35.663
What are you doing here?

26:35.697 --> 26:36.767
Look, we live next door.

26:36.802 --> 26:37.768
[Whispers] What?

26:37.803 --> 26:40.012
We heard yelling from
our bedroom window.

26:40.046 --> 26:41.082
What the hell is going on?

26:41.116 --> 26:44.672
Sorry, I, uh -- You know
what, I can't hear you.

26:44.706 --> 26:45.811
Come to the door.

26:45.845 --> 26:48.814
Uh-huh, okay-okay-okay.

26:52.162 --> 26:53.888
Hey, you okay?

26:53.922 --> 26:55.924
No, Mason is here,
he's causing trouble.

26:55.959 --> 26:57.650
Mason is here.

26:57.685 --> 27:00.446
Shit, I hate that fucking guy.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.690
Listen; maybe you should come
hang with Lisa and me

27:02.724 --> 27:03.932
until we figure this all out.

27:03.967 --> 27:07.004
[Screams]
Hey, get away from them.

27:07.936 --> 27:08.903
Come after me.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.940
Get away from her.

27:11.975 --> 27:12.700
Be right back.

27:12.734 --> 27:14.115
Oh-oh -- oh god.

27:14.943 --> 27:17.705
[Breathes heavily]

27:22.364 --> 27:23.987
Oh fuck.

27:28.025 --> 27:31.719
[Screams] You're gonna,
fucking, let go.

27:32.064 --> 27:33.721
Go [screams].

27:37.759 --> 27:43.696
[Screams]
[Groans in pain]

27:44.386 --> 27:47.251
- Ahhh!
- [Moans in pain]

27:47.286 --> 27:49.737
Oh, oh my god.

27:49.771 --> 27:51.704
[Screams]
[Moaning in pain]

28:00.748 --> 28:02.715
Oh my god...

28:06.754 --> 28:10.240
[Moans in pain] I don't know
what to do.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.725
[Whispers] I've got
my bag, my bag.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.002
What?

28:14.037 --> 28:16.004
Get my fucking gym bag.

28:16.039 --> 28:20.008
There's-there's clean wraps
inside next to my boxing gloves.

28:20.043 --> 28:21.734
Okay.

28:21.769 --> 28:27.153
[Moans in pain]
Okay-okay-okay.

28:28.085 --> 28:29.293
Okay, what do I do?

28:29.328 --> 28:31.882
Wrap my fucking arm.

28:32.193 --> 28:34.160
[Moans in pain]
Okay-okay-okay,

28:34.195 --> 28:35.299
calm down, calm
down, calm down.

28:35.334 --> 28:37.888
Calm down, just, uh -- okay.

28:37.923 --> 28:39.890
Okay, all right.

28:39.925 --> 28:41.547
All right, okay.

28:41.581 --> 28:44.274
I need you to keep
going even if I pass out.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.276
No-no-no, you are not
leaving me to do this alone.

28:46.310 --> 28:46.966
Stay awake, okay?

28:47.001 --> 28:49.175
Just talk to me, talk to me.

28:49.210 --> 28:54.249
[Breathes heavily]
There was someone else

28:54.284 --> 28:58.184
with Mason out
there in the dark.

28:58.219 --> 29:00.255
What?

29:00.290 --> 29:04.259
I couldn't see properly,
but he was fucking huge.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.054
All right, just-just breathe.

29:06.089 --> 29:07.193
- [Moans in pain]
- No-no-no, shhh...

29:07.228 --> 29:11.128
just breathe in and out.

29:11.163 --> 29:16.927
[Exhales deeply]
Oh, fuck me [moans in pain].

29:24.245 --> 29:25.902
Why didn't they kill us?

29:26.350 --> 29:28.283
I think they tried their best.

29:28.318 --> 29:30.182
No-no, I mean the
door was wide open.

29:30.216 --> 29:31.597
Why didn't they come inside?

29:31.631 --> 29:34.911
I don't know, maybe
they're enjoying themselves.

29:34.945 --> 29:36.188
None of this makes any sense.

29:36.222 --> 29:38.811
I grew up around Ted and Lisa,
they sell CBD dog biscuits,

29:38.846 --> 29:40.882
and now they're hacking
people up with machetes,

29:40.917 --> 29:43.057
because some black guy
got into a bar fight?

29:43.091 --> 29:45.231
Maybe you don't know them
as well as you think you do.

29:45.266 --> 29:47.958
Or maybe something
weird is going on,

29:47.993 --> 29:52.100
like I told you, the
whole town is acting bizarre.

29:53.653 --> 29:55.828
Maybe they're not in control.

29:56.173 --> 29:57.209
Bullshit.

29:57.381 --> 29:58.555
What are you doing?

29:58.589 --> 30:03.871
I'm not gonna stay here and
listen to you give excuses

30:03.905 --> 30:06.425
for your racist white
supremacist friends.

30:06.459 --> 30:08.220
I'm serious; we need to
figure out what's happening.

30:08.254 --> 30:10.981
We have to get the
fuck out of here.

30:11.016 --> 30:12.327
Now, Jack's coming
back with the car.

30:12.362 --> 30:14.951
But first, I have to
find my dad's safe.

30:14.985 --> 30:15.503
Why?

30:15.537 --> 30:16.366
Who the fuck cares?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.299
I do.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.921
I need it.

30:20.439 --> 30:21.992
Are you serious?

30:24.339 --> 30:26.238
Ben?

30:33.003 --> 30:34.073
You dropped your phone.

30:34.246 --> 30:35.834
All this over a bar fight?

30:42.392 --> 30:43.876
Amy, right?

30:43.911 --> 30:45.257
Yeah, oh, that's cute.

30:47.328 --> 30:48.432
Mason.

30:48.467 --> 30:52.160
I remember you, always sitting
in the corner of the

30:52.195 --> 30:55.267
bar with a fork, alone.

30:57.062 --> 30:58.166
I don't know how
you ended up here,

30:58.201 --> 30:59.374
I don't care.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.205
Just stop
helping him, go home.

31:04.345 --> 31:06.002
Mason, this is fucked.

31:06.174 --> 31:10.213
Amy, I promise you
haven't seen anything yet.

31:13.216 --> 31:15.011
Now, are you staying
or are you leaving?

31:17.254 --> 31:18.946
You don't even know him.

31:20.948 --> 31:22.087
Your call.

31:40.519 --> 31:42.245
You can't come
inside, can you?

31:47.422 --> 31:49.079
What's really happening here?

31:50.978 --> 31:52.531
Why are you doing this?

31:54.119 --> 31:56.121
It's me now or
half the town later,

31:57.260 --> 31:59.055
they're gonna figure
out where you are.

32:02.161 --> 32:07.028
Come outside, get past me,
you can make your escape.

32:11.343 --> 32:14.104
[Breathes heavily]

32:14.139 --> 32:15.934
I like disappointing you, Mason.

32:26.151 --> 32:28.429
We're gonna finish
what we started.

32:34.159 --> 32:37.472
You're right, there's
something else going on here.

32:38.301 --> 32:38.991
Turn off the lights.

32:39.026 --> 32:40.441
They already know we're here.

32:40.613 --> 32:42.236
We don't want
them knowing where.

32:43.340 --> 32:44.445
We could block
out the bedroom.

32:57.113 --> 33:00.185
I found some
ibuprofen in the bathroom.

33:00.219 --> 33:01.324
I'm sorry, it's
not gonna do much.

33:01.358 --> 33:03.809
Thanks, I'm fine, I just
-- I need to keep moving.

33:03.843 --> 33:05.500
You should still take it.

33:07.192 --> 33:09.159
Uh, I'm an addict, doesn't
matter if it's sugar pills,

33:09.194 --> 33:10.540
I can't take them.

33:12.059 --> 33:14.164
I'll, um -- uh, at
least have some water.

33:14.199 --> 33:15.338
Here.

33:17.133 --> 33:18.444
Thanks.

33:25.313 --> 33:27.626
[Exhales deeply]
Okay,

33:28.144 --> 33:30.180
I got to find that safe
before Jack gets back.

33:30.215 --> 33:31.285
No-no, hold on, hold on.

33:31.319 --> 33:32.527
We have to figure out
what the fuck's going on.

33:32.562 --> 33:35.047
Uh-huh, you already figured
out that they can't come in,

33:35.082 --> 33:36.497
that's good enough for now.

33:36.531 --> 33:38.326
Now, you're gonna help me
[exhales deeply]

33:38.361 --> 33:39.603
or you can stay here.

33:39.638 --> 33:42.365
No, uh, what, uh --
what about your friend,

33:42.399 --> 33:44.298
we can't warn him.

33:44.332 --> 33:46.541
Mason has your phone,
I don't have one.

33:46.576 --> 33:47.508
What's Mason gonna do

33:47.542 --> 33:49.855
when the -- your friend
comes rolling in?

33:49.889 --> 33:50.787
Oh fuck.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.271
Okay, all right,
all right, all right,

33:52.306 --> 33:54.860
just-just -- all
right, just listen,

33:54.894 --> 33:56.482
just calm down, okay?

33:56.517 --> 33:58.243
All right, we just have to
figure out

33:58.277 --> 34:00.624
what's happening, okay.

34:00.659 --> 34:03.213
I didn't tell you everything
about me and your dad.

34:06.492 --> 34:07.562
Go on.

34:08.805 --> 34:13.258
I, uh, wasn't just keeping
your dad's spare keys for him.

34:13.292 --> 34:17.365
He told me that if anything
weird happened in town that

34:17.400 --> 34:20.541
I was supposed to
come here and hide.

34:21.197 --> 34:23.475
He said it would be safe.

34:23.509 --> 34:24.234
What?

34:24.269 --> 34:25.270
Yeah.

34:25.304 --> 34:27.444
I mean, yeah, I thought
he was a bit eccentric,

34:27.479 --> 34:31.379
but I think -- I think now,

34:31.414 --> 34:34.520
I think he knew something like
this was going to happen.

34:34.555 --> 34:35.797
How?

34:35.832 --> 34:39.663
I don't know, but the research
he was doing at the library,

34:39.698 --> 34:42.390
it was some
really creepy stuff.

34:42.425 --> 34:43.667
Now what kinda stuff?

34:43.702 --> 34:46.153
Well, he would read -- reading
these old books and in these

34:46.187 --> 34:51.675
languages I didn't understand,
but there were diagrams

34:51.710 --> 34:55.231
and there were images,

34:55.679 --> 35:00.581
and they looked evil, demonic.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.100
Come on, Amy.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.136
I'm not messing
around, I swear.

35:04.171 --> 35:05.689
But what does this
have to do with anything?

35:05.724 --> 35:09.383
I just -- I mean, uh -- you
have to admit the whole not

35:09.417 --> 35:11.661
being able to come inside
thing is pretty strange.

35:11.695 --> 35:12.869
Sure, we can
call that strange.

35:12.903 --> 35:16.286
Yeah, and-and like I said,
everything was acting weird

35:16.321 --> 35:18.288
in town before you
even got here.

35:18.323 --> 35:20.566
Yeah, and you wanna
blame that on demons?

35:20.601 --> 35:22.361
No -- I don't know, maybe.

35:22.396 --> 35:23.673
You gotta be
kidding me, come on.

35:23.707 --> 35:26.296
Look, I just wanna
know what's going on.

35:26.331 --> 35:27.642
Why aren't Ted and Lisa
breaking through

35:27.677 --> 35:29.299
the windows right now?

35:29.334 --> 35:33.165
They're racist white
people, they do crazy shit.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.718
And they're just
probably fucking with us.

35:34.753 --> 35:38.377
I just think that if we
could find some of your dad's

35:38.412 --> 35:41.346
research it could give us a
clue as to what's going on.

35:41.380 --> 35:42.450
Demon research.

35:42.485 --> 35:46.627
Uh -- No [moans in pain].

35:46.661 --> 35:47.283
Where are you going?

35:47.317 --> 35:49.181
To find my father's safe.

35:49.216 --> 35:51.632
How can you think
about money right now?

35:51.666 --> 35:54.635
I promised Jack I'd
find it, and I owe him.

35:54.669 --> 35:55.739
What is he, your bookie?

35:55.774 --> 35:57.983
What kind of friend
needs your money this badly?

35:58.017 --> 36:02.298
My only friend and he'd dying.

36:02.332 --> 36:05.439
What?

36:05.473 --> 36:08.338
Cancer.

36:08.373 --> 36:12.239
And I don't want him to
spend his last days broke,

36:12.273 --> 36:17.416
in a rat-infested
hospice, because of me.

36:18.659 --> 36:20.212
Because of you?

36:20.247 --> 36:21.075
What?

36:21.109 --> 36:27.392
Just wanna know my
whole life story?

36:27.426 --> 36:32.604
Fine, got all the time
in the world, right?

36:38.265 --> 36:40.577
[Exhales deeply]

36:45.927 --> 36:49.448
Jack was my boxing trainer
and manager

36:49.483 --> 36:53.659
ever since I was a
kid he'd look out for me,

36:53.694 --> 36:59.044
in the ring and out, even
when I was being a shitty kid

36:59.078 --> 37:02.703
thinking I was invincible.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.433
For a time I kinda was,
I was winning fights,

37:09.330 --> 37:12.333
then I started partying hard.

37:13.645 --> 37:16.234
Jack wanted me to
stop, but I didn't listen.

37:17.649 --> 37:22.378
I got out of control, ended
up hurting this guy

37:22.412 --> 37:27.590
before the actual fight at the
fucking weigh-ins.

37:27.624 --> 37:30.696
Boxing commission
came down hard,

37:30.731 --> 37:32.319
revoked my license.

37:32.871 --> 37:36.702
Now, both me and
Jack are broke,

37:36.737 --> 37:39.429
and he's got cancer.

37:42.708 --> 37:47.092
So Arthur's money is the only
way I know how to make his

37:47.126 --> 37:48.749
life a little bit
more comfortable.

37:51.545 --> 37:53.374
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

37:55.618 --> 37:57.723
Something here is fucked.

37:58.759 --> 38:02.314
And I don't know what I'm
gonna do when Jack gets here,

38:02.349 --> 38:05.490
but it's all for nothing
if I don't find that money.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.568
Come with me.

38:25.717 --> 38:27.615
I've been all over the house
looking for more of your dad's

38:27.650 --> 38:29.755
research,
there's no safe here.

38:29.790 --> 38:32.758
The only place I
haven't gone is the cellar,

38:32.793 --> 38:38.695
but the entrance is on
the side of the house,

38:38.730 --> 38:40.387
you have to go outside.

38:40.801 --> 38:42.354
Of course it is.

38:42.768 --> 38:43.769
You really think it's there?

38:43.804 --> 38:44.701
Maybe.

38:45.909 --> 38:48.809
And sometimes when I pick up
Arthur he'd be down there.

38:48.843 --> 38:50.776
He said it was
cooler in the summer.

38:51.190 --> 38:52.260
How far exactly?

38:52.295 --> 38:57.542
Well, it's, um -- it's
from there to around there.

38:57.956 --> 38:59.164
Okay.

39:00.683 --> 39:05.412
If I go in the dark and keep
quiet I think I can get inside

39:05.446 --> 39:06.792
without them noticing.

39:06.827 --> 39:08.415
Can you run in your condition?

39:09.692 --> 39:12.419
Yeah, it's not
far, I'll be fine.

39:12.936 --> 39:16.457
Listen, we know they
can't come in the house,

39:16.492 --> 39:18.942
but what about under it,
does the cellar count?

39:20.461 --> 39:24.672
I don't know, we have to
try; give me your knife.

39:24.707 --> 39:27.503
For fuck sake, I'm not staying
here alone in the dark.

39:27.537 --> 39:30.160
And besides, you'll never
find the door without me.

39:32.818 --> 39:33.923
I appreciate it.

39:36.581 --> 39:40.585
On three, I'm gonna
turn off the light,

39:41.482 --> 39:45.797
you're gonna open the
door, we're gonna keep quiet.

39:47.039 --> 39:49.904
If I get caught you run back.

39:53.874 --> 39:57.464
Fuck, Ben, I don't wanna die.

39:59.914 --> 40:01.399
We better make it.

40:03.021 --> 40:08.475
One, two, three.

40:09.924 --> 40:12.202
[door opens]

40:12.237 --> 40:14.032
[crickets chirping]

40:14.204 --> 40:15.171
[door shuts]

40:16.034 --> 40:22.212
[crickets chirping]
[footsteps]

40:22.834 --> 40:25.008
[BEN] Amy, where are you?

40:27.666 --> 40:30.082
- [Laughing]
- [BEN] Be quiet.

40:30.669 --> 40:31.774
[BEN] Where are you?

40:33.603 --> 40:37.780
-[Laughing] -[AMY] Ben, it's
not me, come back.

40:37.987 --> 40:39.782
[WOMAN] [Laughing] Take
my hand.

40:39.816 --> 40:41.680
- [BEN] [Shoving] Get off me.
- [WOMAN] [Laughing]

40:41.715 --> 40:42.923
- [WOMAN] [Laughing]
- [BEN] Amy, run!

40:42.957 --> 40:45.235
- [AMY] Get off of him!
- [BEN] Amy, run!

40:45.270 --> 40:47.237
[WOMAN] [Screams] Ben!

40:53.761 --> 40:54.900
[AMY] [Screams] Ben!

40:55.625 --> 40:59.698
[WOMAN] [Laughs]
[AMY] [Exhales deeply]

40:59.733 --> 41:00.872
[AMY] Fuck.

41:02.218 --> 41:03.599
[Moans in pain]

41:03.806 --> 41:07.568
[Exhales deeply]
Did you see Lisa?

41:07.810 --> 41:08.776
Lisa?

41:08.811 --> 41:10.260
She was trying to pull you
into the trees.

41:10.295 --> 41:11.158
Yeah,

41:12.124 --> 41:14.782
- [Exhales deeply]
...where's the knife?

41:14.817 --> 41:17.060
[Exhales deeply] Oh
my god, oh my god,

41:17.095 --> 41:17.923
I must've dropped it.

41:19.097 --> 41:20.132
-Oh, you gotta be fucking
kidding me. -I'm so sorry,

41:20.167 --> 41:22.549
I'm sorry, I'm so fucked.

41:22.583 --> 41:23.757
[Exhales deeply] Oh my god.

41:23.791 --> 41:25.828
Oh my god, I'm gonna be sick.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

41:25.862 --> 41:28.037
Come on.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:28.589 --> 41:30.971
[Breathes deeply]
No, sorry, I'm sorry.

41:31.005 --> 41:32.697
You just saved me, all right;

41:32.731 --> 41:34.975
just -- I-I shouldn't have
made us do that.

41:35.009 --> 41:37.529
Um, it's -- I told you
something fucked was going on.

41:37.564 --> 41:38.668
Look, we're
gonna figure it out.

41:38.703 --> 41:39.911
We're gonna find
that fucking safe,

41:39.945 --> 41:41.637
and we get the
fuck outta here.

41:41.671 --> 41:44.743
I'll be okay, just
give me a second.

41:44.778 --> 41:49.058
Oh my god [exhales deeply].

41:51.025 --> 41:53.027
What is that?

41:59.068 --> 42:00.794
Looks like an
old church pulpit.

42:00.828 --> 42:02.796
Well, as one of the
only Jews in town,

42:02.830 --> 42:04.867
I'm gonna take
your word on that.

42:07.663 --> 42:09.872
Yeah, it's a church pulpit,

42:09.906 --> 42:14.566
Second Coming Baptist
Church, 1965.

42:15.878 --> 42:16.982
Oh, look at this.

42:17.017 --> 42:17.811
What is it?

42:17.845 --> 42:18.812
It's some of your
dad's research,

42:18.846 --> 42:21.573
old photocopies.

42:21.608 --> 42:24.127
"Reverend Peter Rakes and son
Arthur outside of Kingsport's

42:24.162 --> 42:27.683
first integrated church,
Second Coming Baptist,

42:27.717 --> 42:29.754
Ben, I think this is your
father and grandpa there.

42:29.788 --> 42:33.585
Let me see that.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.691
Tragedy in Kingsport.

42:36.070 --> 42:38.590
Authorities are investigating
possible arson after Second

42:38.625 --> 42:40.972
Coming Baptist Church
burned, Wednesday evening.

42:41.006 --> 42:43.940
Reverend Peter Rakes is
believed to have perished

42:43.975 --> 42:45.632
in the blaze.

42:45.666 --> 42:47.599
Arson?

42:47.634 --> 42:49.118
Your father must have brought
your grandfather's

42:49.152 --> 42:50.740
old pulpit down here.

42:51.016 --> 42:53.640
It's probably all that
was left after the fire.

42:58.058 --> 42:59.611
What the fuck?
What?

42:59.646 --> 43:01.820
Look at the date
of the newspaper.

43:01.855 --> 43:04.789
Friday, October 3rd, 1969.

43:04.823 --> 43:06.894
Yeah, but the
actual fire, it says,

43:06.929 --> 43:09.932
was on Wednesday, the 1st.

43:09.966 --> 43:11.105
Yeah.

43:16.939 --> 43:19.389
It's the same as the
code for the safe.

43:21.184 --> 43:23.083
Oh my god, October 1st.

43:23.117 --> 43:24.187
Yeah.

43:24.222 --> 43:25.706
What does it mean?

43:25.741 --> 43:26.638
I don't know.

43:26.673 --> 43:27.294
What else is there?

43:27.328 --> 43:30.746
Um, an old police report.

43:30.780 --> 43:31.954
About the fire?

43:31.988 --> 43:34.646
I don't think -- uh, no,
it's dated a few days before.

43:34.681 --> 43:36.959
It's so faded, I
can't read it.

43:36.993 --> 43:38.201
Let me try.

43:40.203 --> 43:42.689
[Trigger pulled] [Clang]
- Oh!

43:44.760 --> 43:45.657
Oh!

43:48.073 --> 43:49.385
[BEN] Put it out. Move.

45:02.113 --> 45:03.942
-it's me.

45:07.566 --> 45:09.051
You're good.

45:09.914 --> 45:11.916
Hey, we're good.

45:14.125 --> 45:17.887
[Breathes heavily]

45:17.922 --> 45:21.926
Well, I guess I found your
fucking safe, huh.

45:30.797 --> 45:36.906
[Breathes heavily]
[Makes popping noise]

45:36.941 --> 45:38.218
Holy shit.

45:39.598 --> 45:41.152
This had better be worth it.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.880
Did that motherfucker
say he wanted to eat me?

45:45.604 --> 45:54.268
[Laugh]
[Laughs]

45:54.303 --> 45:57.824
Cannibal cult?
Oh, fuck me.

45:58.100 --> 46:00.309
[Exhales deeply] Oh.

46:01.206 --> 46:07.212
Hey, thank you, couldn't
have done this without you.

46:08.006 --> 46:09.076
No kidding.

46:11.872 --> 46:15.289
Arthur, what the
fuck were you up to.

46:16.049 --> 46:17.360
Uh, let me see
the police report.

46:17.395 --> 46:18.879
Can you read it?

46:18.914 --> 46:20.881
If you put the
light up here maybe.

46:20.916 --> 46:22.918
[Laughs] Okay.

46:23.953 --> 46:28.164
Okay, I see my grandfather's
name and -- no way.

46:28.924 --> 46:29.856
What?

46:30.857 --> 46:32.790
The home address is
the same as the church.

46:33.031 --> 46:33.929
So?

46:34.239 --> 46:35.275
Read it.

46:41.281 --> 46:42.282
It was here.

46:43.386 --> 46:45.803
Yeah, I my dad didn't
bring the pulpit downstairs.

46:46.873 --> 46:48.115
It was always there.

46:49.323 --> 46:51.360
Your dad built the house where
your grandfather's church

46:51.394 --> 46:52.395
burned down.

46:52.430 --> 46:56.986
Yeah, my dad retired and
moved home, literally.

46:57.021 --> 46:57.676
But why?

46:57.711 --> 46:58.919
Not for the happy memories.

46:58.954 --> 47:00.058
For protection.

47:00.093 --> 47:01.301
From what?

47:03.372 --> 47:05.961
If the house is on the same
land as the church

47:05.995 --> 47:08.618
then it's on
consecrated grounds.

47:10.068 --> 47:11.414
Holy shit.

47:11.898 --> 47:13.002
Exactly.

47:13.692 --> 47:16.903
That's why cannibal
cult can't come inside.

47:17.420 --> 47:18.628
Maybe you're right.

47:19.837 --> 47:25.463
Something demonic is going on.
And maybe my dad knew it.

47:26.153 --> 47:27.258
Uh, maybe.

47:27.292 --> 47:28.259
You've got all
your dad's research.

47:28.293 --> 47:30.295
You've got cannibal
guy, down in the cellar,

47:30.330 --> 47:32.159
puking blood when
it comes inside,

47:32.194 --> 47:32.988
and now this.

47:33.022 --> 47:35.266
What more
evidence do you need?

47:36.474 --> 47:38.200
Yeah, but why is
this happening?

47:38.234 --> 47:39.891
What's the point?

47:39.926 --> 47:41.134
I don't know.

47:41.444 --> 47:43.446
And why is your dad's safe
combo the same as

47:43.481 --> 47:45.069
the date of the fire?

47:45.932 --> 47:46.277
Fuck.

47:49.487 --> 47:53.422
If there's no money in
there this is all for nothing.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.183
Okay, well, calm down,
let's just open it.

47:56.218 --> 47:57.978
[Door knocks]

48:00.084 --> 48:01.430
Oh, this keeps getting better.

48:04.088 --> 48:08.230
[Door knocks] Hello?

48:09.093 --> 48:10.439
Hello, Ben Rakes, you there?

48:11.026 --> 48:13.269
Hey, your friend Jack sent me.

48:13.442 --> 48:14.236
Ben?

48:16.376 --> 48:20.207
Hey, my name is Jay Amir; I'm
a nurse at Kingsport General.

48:20.242 --> 48:22.209
Your friend Jack
told me what happened,

48:22.244 --> 48:28.112
said I should come
look at your hand.

48:28.146 --> 48:29.078
Where's Jack?

48:29.113 --> 48:30.286
Ben?

48:30.321 --> 48:32.081
Where is Jack?

48:32.116 --> 48:36.396
He was involved in a fight,
he's being held in emergency.

48:36.430 --> 48:41.919
Ben, what are we
doing here, man?

48:43.368 --> 48:44.335
Hold on.

48:48.028 --> 48:53.413
[Breathes heavily]
Seriously?

48:54.379 --> 48:55.173
No.

48:56.002 --> 49:02.284
[Breathes heavily]
There we go.

49:03.285 --> 49:04.251
Don't drop that one.

49:07.151 --> 49:09.360
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah,
what the fuck?

49:09.394 --> 49:11.983
What are you doing?

49:12.018 --> 49:14.365
Uh, sorry, we're just,
um -- We were attacked.

49:15.228 --> 49:17.506
Christ, everyone in
this town has gone nuts.

49:18.265 --> 49:19.991
No-no, I'm out.

49:20.026 --> 49:25.134
Oh -- Wait, hey,
is Jack all right?

49:26.032 --> 49:27.309
Ask him yourself,
he's at the hospital.

49:27.550 --> 49:29.242
Oh please-please,
we need help,

49:29.276 --> 49:30.450
please.

49:34.350 --> 49:35.455
Let me see.

49:39.597 --> 49:41.185
Show me the damage.

49:41.564 --> 49:42.565
Check her first.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.153
I can see you both,

49:44.188 --> 49:46.052
and right now you need
medical attention.

49:46.638 --> 49:48.364
It's okay, Ben,
I'm a big girl.

49:48.571 --> 49:52.299
[Breathes heavily]

49:52.334 --> 49:55.302
Jesus, I thought it was
just your hand.

49:55.578 --> 50:00.445
It was till the local lynch
mob got me [moans in pain].

50:00.480 --> 50:01.515
Okay.

50:02.758 --> 50:04.208
If I take that wrap off the
bleeding is gonna get worse.

50:05.278 --> 50:08.246
Here, best I can do
right now is antibiotics.

50:08.557 --> 50:10.559
No pills, I'm a
recovering addict.

50:10.593 --> 50:12.423
No, it's
penicillin, not painkillers.

50:12.457 --> 50:13.320
I can't do it, man.

50:13.355 --> 50:14.839
You know I'm here
to help you, right.

50:14.873 --> 50:18.256
He said no; he
needs a hospital,

50:18.291 --> 50:21.121
we both do.

50:21.156 --> 50:23.020
Yeah, you're right.

50:23.675 --> 50:27.058
And Jack said that the sheriff
is helping people look for me.

50:27.231 --> 50:28.508
I don't think that's safe.

50:29.371 --> 50:31.580
There's a -- there's a
hospital in Elliot Lake.

50:31.614 --> 50:33.582
Could-could you
drive us there?

50:36.136 --> 50:38.138
Okay.

50:39.657 --> 50:42.246
Get in the back, stay low.

50:43.109 --> 50:44.489
Let's go.

50:44.524 --> 50:46.250
[Moans in pain] Come on.

50:47.216 --> 50:49.529
Uh, wait, I
forgot this safe box,

50:49.563 --> 50:50.633
I'll be right back.

50:52.118 --> 50:53.291
Uh-uh, no, there's no time.

50:53.326 --> 50:54.465
Just give me a second.

50:54.499 --> 50:56.191
No, look -- okay, you
should not be walking around,

50:56.225 --> 50:57.640
just get in the
car, Amy will get it.

50:57.675 --> 51:04.544
[Breathes heavily]
What - what are you two doing?

51:06.718 --> 51:08.306
How did you know my name?

51:10.550 --> 51:13.104
I-I don't know, Jack
told me when we were,

51:13.139 --> 51:15.417
uh, when, uh -- uh,

51:16.901 --> 51:18.489
[Sighs]

51:20.870 --> 51:22.562
you got me.

51:43.721 --> 51:45.792
You motherfuckers.

51:52.212 --> 51:53.455
Seriously, you?

51:54.973 --> 51:56.285
Birds of a feather.

51:57.459 --> 51:59.185
Aren't you both clever.

51:59.495 --> 52:00.496
Jesus.

52:00.531 --> 52:04.121
I told you, I like
disappointing you, Mason.

52:05.605 --> 52:07.538
Ben, let's go into the house.

52:07.572 --> 52:10.437
What the hell is this anyway,
some sort of racist cult,

52:10.472 --> 52:12.405
with a side of brown?

52:12.612 --> 52:14.441
You guys like going
out picking fights,

52:14.476 --> 52:15.822
trying to kill black folks.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.169
Well, it's not going too
well this time, is it?

52:18.204 --> 52:19.757
You know, it would've been
over real quick if you just

52:19.791 --> 52:21.241
passed out at the bar.

52:21.276 --> 52:22.484
Quiet.

52:22.518 --> 52:23.657
Passed out?

52:24.762 --> 52:25.694
You don't drink.

52:25.728 --> 52:26.453
No, I don't.

52:26.488 --> 52:28.973
Did you drug me
with something?

52:29.007 --> 52:33.495
Yeah, don't feel bad,
addict's tolerance.

52:34.461 --> 52:37.464
Come out of the house now
and no one else gets hurt.

52:37.499 --> 52:39.777
You wanna eat us, Mason?

52:39.811 --> 52:41.986
The guy in the basement
said that just before

52:42.020 --> 52:44.782
we bashed his brains out.

52:44.816 --> 52:48.268
So, let me ask you, do you
wanna get a slice of white

52:48.303 --> 52:50.477
bread and eat us?

52:54.723 --> 52:56.276
Just you.

52:57.519 --> 53:00.970
What's fucking wrong with you?

53:02.317 --> 53:04.629
I am sorry you keep bringing
other people into this, Ben.

53:05.665 --> 53:07.218
I didn't wanna do this.

53:07.253 --> 53:08.046
This?

53:08.081 --> 53:09.807
What's this?
Ben, let's just go.

53:09.841 --> 53:12.810
You better come out of
the house now, Ben.

53:12.844 --> 53:14.398
Oh yeah.

53:21.301 --> 53:22.371
What is this?

53:22.406 --> 53:26.582
Okay-okay-okay
[moans in pain].

53:26.617 --> 53:27.790
The fuck.
Don't.

53:27.825 --> 53:29.792
Ben, just get
back in the house,

53:29.827 --> 53:31.484
fuck these guys.

53:31.518 --> 53:34.694
[Moans in pain]
Like I said, Ben,

53:34.728 --> 53:36.730
come out of the house
and no one else gets hurt.

53:36.765 --> 53:38.732
I'm gonna fucking kill
you if you hurt him.

53:38.767 --> 53:39.561
Stay back.

53:39.595 --> 53:40.424
Fuck.

53:40.458 --> 53:41.804
[Exhales deeply]

53:43.910 --> 53:45.429
What?

53:50.503 --> 53:53.022
[Breathes heavily]

53:54.438 --> 53:59.891
[Moans in pain]

54:00.961 --> 54:04.448
[Car engine revving]

54:06.588 --> 54:08.659
Decision time, Ben.

54:08.693 --> 54:09.694
She's moving pretty fast.

54:09.729 --> 54:12.594
I don't know how long
that fishing line is.

54:12.628 --> 54:14.423
It's around his neck.

54:14.458 --> 54:16.322
Stay back on the porch.

54:16.356 --> 54:17.633
Let him go.

54:17.668 --> 54:19.739
Come down out of the
house and I'll cut the line.

54:19.773 --> 54:21.085
He'll kill you both.

54:21.119 --> 54:23.398
Jack-Jack, what do I do?

54:23.432 --> 54:25.365
Come down and take
his place and he lives.

54:25.400 --> 54:26.849
Fine, I will.

54:26.884 --> 54:33.339
No, son, listen to me, you don't
give these fuckers anything.

54:35.375 --> 54:44.729
[inaudible]

54:53.773 --> 55:02.437
[inaudible]

55:04.887 --> 55:11.066

55:13.033 --> 55:18.073
[inaudible]

55:32.398 --> 55:34.607
[Screams]

55:46.826 --> 55:52.763
Ben, I'm so sorry
about your friend.

55:54.420 --> 55:55.386
It's my fault.

55:55.421 --> 55:57.664
Okay, we're not
gonna go there.

55:57.699 --> 56:00.426
He came here to get me.

56:00.460 --> 56:02.738
He wouldn't have been
here if it wasn't for me.

56:02.773 --> 56:04.395
You were trying to help him.

56:04.430 --> 56:05.258
No, I wasn't.

56:05.292 --> 56:09.607
I was trying to
fix my own fuckup.

56:10.539 --> 56:11.989
I'm not a good person, Amy.

56:13.991 --> 56:16.407
Jack and I didn't
lose our boxing careers,

56:16.442 --> 56:21.654
because of my drinking,

56:21.688 --> 56:23.587
I cheated.

56:26.521 --> 56:27.867
I hurt people.

56:28.592 --> 56:29.662
What do you mean?

56:33.562 --> 56:36.220
When I first started
losing the big fights

56:36.254 --> 56:39.810
I thought it was because
of the partying,

56:39.844 --> 56:44.539
all the drinking and drugs
slowed me down, right.

56:44.573 --> 56:50.614
So, I sobered up,
trained harder.

56:50.648 --> 56:55.584
But deep down I was afraid
I just wasn't as good as

56:55.619 --> 56:58.553
I thought I was, and I
didn't want that to be true.

56:58.587 --> 57:02.039
So, I made a change.

57:02.073 --> 57:03.868
Jack would've
killed me if he knew,

57:03.903 --> 57:11.566
but I got one of my
assistant trainers

57:11.600 --> 57:13.430
to start loading my gloves.

57:15.293 --> 57:19.228
So he put plaster of
Paris in the wraps,

57:21.058 --> 57:23.578
made my fists like
a concrete block;

57:25.959 --> 57:27.513
I started winning.

57:29.687 --> 57:31.482
And the inevitable happened.

57:32.518 --> 57:33.588
What?

57:33.795 --> 57:35.935
I started really
hurting people.

57:36.867 --> 57:38.938
I was winning in
devastating fashion.

57:39.939 --> 57:45.807
I was breaking jaws,
noses, orbital bones;

57:49.949 --> 57:51.571
one guy lost his sight.

57:55.610 --> 57:59.786
I knew it was wrong,
but I was winning again,

57:59.959 --> 58:05.620
and Jack was happy,
I-I couldn't stop.

58:06.724 --> 58:13.628
And you got caught, and
Jack took the blame too.

58:15.630 --> 58:17.839
Yeah, we both
got lifetime bans.

58:19.565 --> 58:23.948
And then Jack got cancer, and
then he was gonna die broke

58:23.983 --> 58:29.126
and-and I just got him
killed trying to fix it.

58:35.719 --> 58:40.965
Okay, well, you fucked
up the fighting thing,

58:43.174 --> 58:51.010
you did some bad shit, but
you were trying to help him.

58:51.044 --> 58:57.810
You didn't get Jack killed,
Mason did, blame him.

59:00.606 --> 59:01.676
I do.

59:01.710 --> 59:09.580
Good, fuck him, and fuck
all those people with him.

59:09.615 --> 59:11.030
You're right.

59:13.860 --> 59:15.068
I'm gonna fucking kill Mason.

59:15.103 --> 59:16.898
No, that's not what I meant.

59:18.071 --> 59:23.732
[Moans in pain] Fucking
[indiscernible].

59:23.767 --> 59:27.149
[Moans in pain] Fuck.

59:27.184 --> 59:30.049
Stop it; this is exactly
what he wishes you'll do.

59:30.083 --> 59:31.878
[Moans in pain]
Then I'm gonna be his

59:31.913 --> 59:34.156
fairy-fucking-godmother.

59:34.191 --> 59:36.020
Fuck this.

59:36.434 --> 59:43.407
[Breathes heavily] Okay-okay,
you go out there and you die

59:43.441 --> 59:47.687
or you get eaten or whatever,

59:47.722 --> 59:50.034
something really bad
is gonna happen.

59:50.069 --> 59:51.277
What are you talking about?

59:51.311 --> 59:54.038
Ben, I don't think that you're
just some random black guy

59:54.073 --> 59:55.868
they found in a bar.

01:00:00.873 --> 01:00:06.741
Look, [indiscernible]
September, 1969,

01:00:06.775 --> 01:00:09.088
your grandfather reports
something to the police,

01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:10.123
okay?

01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:12.919
October 1st, 1969,

01:00:12.954 --> 01:00:15.059
he dies when somebody
burns down his church.

01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:16.336
Yeah, we know that.

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.166
Okay, so your dad's doing all
of this creepy -- your dad's

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.962
doing all of this
creepy research,

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:23.654
and then he dies
suddenly in a car crash.

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.760
But, Ben, your father
barely drove anymore,

01:00:25.794 --> 01:00:27.002
I had to take him to
and from the library.

01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.452
So, it's like he
saw something,

01:00:28.486 --> 01:00:31.041
got spooked, and
died trying to run.

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:32.180
Like he knew he was in danger.

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.043
Exactly.

01:00:33.077 --> 01:00:37.150
So, he left you
combo to the safe,

01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:40.671
the same date as the fire.

01:00:42.984 --> 01:00:45.227
He needed you to
know something.

01:00:47.264 --> 01:00:48.990
But the will says
there was money.

01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:52.959
Well, I mean, you
said so yourself, Ben,

01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:54.754
that you weren't exactly
the greatest guy in the past,

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:56.273
and you hadn't kept in touch.

01:00:56.307 --> 01:01:01.243
So, maybe he thought this was
the only way to get you here,

01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.073
to warn you.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:07.146
Fair.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.704
Time to open that safe.

01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:18.847
Let's do this.

01:01:18.882 --> 01:01:20.228
Be careful.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.041
What is it?

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:43.907
Uh, it looks
like a-a recorder.

01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:50.776
Oh, and there's a
-- it's a cassette.

01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:56.747
It's the same date
as the police report.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.199
Put it in, let's play it.

01:02:21.945 --> 01:02:24.775
[Exhales deeply]
It's broken.

01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:27.260
Looks like it.

01:02:38.064 --> 01:02:47.246
[Audio tape starts playing]
[Indistinct chatter]

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.904
This is Reverend Peter Rakes.

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:53.079
The date is
September 29th, 1969.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:57.049
What follows is a recording of
the exorcism of Mason Banks,

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.326
age 36.

01:02:58.982 --> 01:03:00.811
Present with me are
Mason and his mother,

01:03:00.846 --> 01:03:01.950
Ethel Banks.

01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.849
Please, hurry.

01:03:03.883 --> 01:03:06.161
[Breathes heavily]
Untie me.

01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:08.612
Mason, your mother and
I are trying to help you.

01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:10.096
An exorcism?

01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:12.098
You're not Catholic priest.

01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:13.962
I am god's servant.

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:16.378
A lonely Baptist in
a crumbling church.

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:19.830
Let me look closer at
you [indiscernible].

01:03:19.865 --> 01:03:20.969
Uh, how is he doing that?

01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:22.868
Don't look at it,
read with me.

01:03:22.902 --> 01:03:25.629
Be strong in the lord, for we
do not wrestle against flesh

01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:27.942
and blood, but against
the cosmic powers

01:03:27.976 --> 01:03:29.909
over the present darkness.

01:03:29.944 --> 01:03:31.048
Stop, wait.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:36.882
[Laughs] Why have been
[indiscernible] yourself to me.

01:03:37.365 --> 01:03:40.955
He spit and step on
your Nazarenes cross,

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:43.198
he called out to me.

01:03:43.233 --> 01:03:44.234
You lie.

01:03:44.268 --> 01:03:46.995
He wanted the
power to hurt you.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.928
He hates you.

01:03:48.963 --> 01:03:49.273
What?

01:03:49.308 --> 01:03:50.550
Why?

01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:56.660
You're no church integration,
Negroes praying with whites,

01:03:56.694 --> 01:04:00.284
the boys will ensure
the power to destroy you.

01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:03.460
I did you a
favor by taking him.

01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:09.224
Our father in heaven, hallowed
be thy name -- get off her.

01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:15.472
Keep fighting
[Screams]

01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:18.993
My teeth are dull, but strong.

01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:22.375
You killed her [indiscernible]
-- [Indiscernible] reverend,

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.412
this boy will eat
your living flesh.

01:04:24.446 --> 01:04:26.069
That will not happen.

01:04:26.103 --> 01:04:31.039
If not you, then
your son or his son,

01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:35.457
this is my promise, I curse.

01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:40.117
I shall reward the boy with
unimaginable power

01:04:40.152 --> 01:04:43.293
once he has tasted your
family's living flesh.

01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:47.366
Stay back, in the
name Jesus Christ.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.368
See you soon, reverend.

01:04:49.402 --> 01:04:53.372
Mason, wait-wait.

01:04:57.169 --> 01:05:01.380
[Audio tape stops playing]

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.246
Fuck.

01:05:08.387 --> 01:05:09.422
Fuck.

01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:17.534
Ben-Ben, can you hear me?

01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:21.262
Come on out.

01:05:24.092 --> 01:05:29.166
I'll cook you in there like
we did with your granddaddy.

01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:31.997
[Laughs] You motherfucker.

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.416
[Screams]

01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:42.041
What do we do now, Ben?

01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:48.047
Shit, here we go.

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.576
So, you staying in or
you coming out, Ben?

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:05.444
If you come out
I'll spare the girl.

01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:09.551
Go fuck yourself,
you fucking fuck.

01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:11.001
Amy?
What?

01:06:11.036 --> 01:06:12.244
Quiet.

01:06:12.278 --> 01:06:13.107
What?

01:06:13.141 --> 01:06:14.384
You'll let the girl go?

01:06:20.183 --> 01:06:21.322
I'll think about it.

01:06:31.194 --> 01:06:32.436
Now you can't be serious?

01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.197
I'm not.

01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:36.993
I have a plan.

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:46.312
I'm not gonna fight.

01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:48.142
We're not.

01:06:48.176 --> 01:06:50.316
Jay's car is still
here, I've got the keys.

01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.180
I'll go out there and distract
them while you make a

01:06:52.215 --> 01:06:53.354
run for the car.

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.425
Fuck that, I'm not
leaving you alone.

01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:58.497
Well, then what, Amy,
what are you gonna do?

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.844
You're gonna stay
here and die in a fire,

01:07:00.878 --> 01:07:03.467
screaming like my grandfather
while those fuckers watch.

01:07:03.502 --> 01:07:05.193
If you go outside and get
eaten alive something fucked

01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:07.057
is gonna happen,
Mason is gonna have,

01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:10.578
fucking, godlike powers;
you really want that?

01:07:10.612 --> 01:07:12.166
At least you might
get out of here.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.236
Stop it.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.478
I know you wanna
be a good guy,

01:07:14.513 --> 01:07:16.446
Ben, but this
isn't how you do it.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:20.588
No.

01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:26.042
Wait, you're wrong.

01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:27.526
What?

01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:30.632
I'm not a good guy.

01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:35.120
We've been doing
this all wrong,

01:07:35.327 --> 01:07:37.605
acting exactly the
way Mason wants,

01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:39.365
like my father
and my grandfather,

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.299
being scared,
trying to escape,

01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:44.129
asking why is this happening.

01:07:44.163 --> 01:07:45.164
Right.

01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:47.097
Well, who the fuck
cares why it's happening.

01:07:47.132 --> 01:07:49.272
Mason wants us out
there so he could eat us.

01:07:49.306 --> 01:07:52.689
Well, fuck him,
let's not do that.

01:07:52.723 --> 01:07:55.657
Let's handle this
like cheating fucks.

01:07:56.313 --> 01:07:57.590
How do we do that?

01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:00.214
Change the rules.

01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:03.320
They wanna eat us; well, they
have to come in here to do it,

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:05.150
on our turf.

01:08:05.184 --> 01:08:07.083
And we'll be ready.

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:10.120
I mean, it's an
idea, but, I mean,

01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:13.537
isn't it holy ground,
they can't come inside.

01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:15.677
Then we'll make it unholy.

01:08:44.258 --> 01:08:47.364
[Breathes heavily]
You ready?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.746
No, but whatever.

01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:52.369
You think we can do this?

01:08:52.404 --> 01:08:53.612
No.

01:08:53.646 --> 01:08:54.785
Fuck.

01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:58.341
Look, the keys are in my
gym bag if they get me first.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.205
No, that better
not fucking happen.

01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.278
You know you swear a
lot for a librarian, right?

01:09:04.726 --> 01:09:06.728
My career is not a
personality trait.

01:09:09.317 --> 01:09:10.422
Yeah, okay.

01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:16.462
[Exhales deeply]
Here we go.

01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:31.650
What's up, Mason?

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:33.652
Are you coming out, Ben?

01:09:35.378 --> 01:09:36.758
I got a question for you.

01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:41.246
We just listened to
a exorcism podcast,

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.731
heard you talking
about eating my family,

01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:46.803
and that demons
would bless you for it.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.221
Well, I can't help, but
notice that there hasn't

01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:52.533
been much eating.

01:09:53.603 --> 01:09:55.674
My grandfather
died in a house fire,

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.746
and my father
died in a car crash,

01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:03.544
so this cannibalism
or insurance fraud?

01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:08.342
Does the rest of your little
cult know what a loser you are,

01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:09.653
huh?

01:10:10.516 --> 01:10:13.726
You must really
wanna eat me, Mason.

01:10:14.658 --> 01:10:19.698
I'm the last Rakes,
your only chance.

01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:23.219
Last chance to come out.

01:10:25.807 --> 01:10:27.602
[Laughs]
That won't help you.

01:10:33.436 --> 01:10:34.540
Oops.

01:10:35.403 --> 01:10:40.650
[Spits]
I desecrate this land,

01:10:41.789 --> 01:10:51.350
I spit and step on the cross,
revoking it as god's house.

01:11:24.935 --> 01:11:27.731
[Breathes heavily]
They did it.

01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:25.513
[Screams]
Amy?

01:12:25.686 --> 01:12:28.930
[Screams]
Fuck.

01:12:28.965 --> 01:12:34.488
[Screams]

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:38.906
[Screams]

01:12:41.771 --> 01:12:42.944
[Yells] Amy!

01:12:43.635 --> 01:12:46.707
[Moans with pain]

01:12:48.674 --> 01:12:50.849
You honestly thought
you could avoid this?

01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:54.508
[Indistinct chatter]
[Moans with pain]

01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:55.750
Where are you going?

01:12:57.442 --> 01:12:59.961
[Moans with pain]

01:12:59.996 --> 01:13:01.722
You thought you
could beat me.

01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:05.381
[Screams]

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:08.901
When I raise my
hand I can feel the stars.

01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:11.939
I can dip my foot down into hell

01:13:11.973 --> 01:13:14.390
and feel the damned
kiss my feet.

01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:17.841
Imagine what I'll be
capable of once I consume you,

01:13:18.014 --> 01:13:22.467
[Inhales deeply]
I will be a god.

01:13:23.053 --> 01:13:36.619
[Moans with pain]
[Breathes heavily]

01:13:37.689 --> 01:13:38.724
It's all right,

01:13:40.036 --> 01:13:41.865
I was never gonna let her go.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.492
[Grunts] [Screams]
[Moans with pain]

01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:52.600
[Breathes heavily]

01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:03.024
Do you know how long I have
waited to taste your flesh?

01:14:04.819 --> 01:14:10.238
To hear you scream, to
be granted my power.

01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:13.794
[Exhales deeply]

01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:16.969
You gonna keep talking about
it or you gonna do it?

01:14:18.074 --> 01:14:24.977
[Screams]
[Moans with pain]

01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:40.993
You feel good, Mason, godlike?

01:14:46.827 --> 01:14:48.656
What have you done?

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:50.589
Bad things.

01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:54.904
See, you're so used to
hurting good people

01:14:54.938 --> 01:14:58.666
you weren't ready for a
bad motherfucker.

01:15:01.566 --> 01:15:02.843
Where is Ben Rakes?

01:15:04.983 --> 01:15:10.713
Spending 30 days in rehab,
I'm his AA sponsor.

01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:14.820
When his dad died he
fell off the wagon,

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.064
so I took him to AA.

01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:21.862
On the way, he kept babbling
about his dad's will

01:15:21.896 --> 01:15:23.795
and money in his safe.

01:15:25.003 --> 01:15:26.936
I was the wrong guy to tell.

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.905
So, I broke into his
place, stole the will,

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.044
and here I am.

01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:37.015
I told you, Mason,
I like disappointing you.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.885

[Screams]

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:49.890
[Screams]
[Moans with pain]

01:15:50.097 --> 01:15:56.068
[Breathes heavily] Yeah

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:07.735
[Screams]
[Moans with pain]

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:12.913
[Screams]
[Moans with pain]

01:16:18.988 --> 01:16:26.927
[Breathes heavily]

01:16:48.224 --> 01:16:55.093
[Breathes heavily]

01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:02.238
Let's go.

01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:14.871
[Breathes heavily]
Fuck.

01:17:15.354 --> 01:17:19.358
[Heavy breathing]
[Grunting]

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:23.155
[Moaning with pain] [Grunting]

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.987
[Heavy breathing] Okay.

01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:34.132
[Breathes heavily] Okay.

01:17:37.273 --> 01:17:40.310
So, what is your name anyway?

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.072
[Breathes heavily]

01:17:45.246 --> 01:17:51.839
[Music Playing]

01:17:58.156 --> 01:18:05.335
