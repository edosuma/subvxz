WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.989
Maybe something where I'd have an estate.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.157
- You know, like lots of land.
- OK.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.997
So, farming?.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.749
What, farming?.
Ugh, God, no, that would be awful!

00:13.800 --> 00:16.234
I quite like the idea of having
my own radio show.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.317
Choosing the music, being
exremely argumentative with racists

00:19.360 --> 00:21.157
during phone-ins, that kind of thing.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.918
Now I'm late for another meeting,
so if we could just...

00:22.960 --> 00:23.870
Right, yes, sorry.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.638
I've already applied for
a Fulbright scholarship

00:25.680 --> 00:27.193
to study lnternational Relations at Yale.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.959
But now I'm thinking I might not apply
to Ordnance Survey after all.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.955
Oh, why's that?.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.195
Because it would entail
working in an office...

00:33.240 --> 00:34.309
with other people.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.157
And you're not a people person?.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.111
Historically, no, I'm not.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.549
Got one last week - I work in a pub.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.875
Right, and is that a good idea
before your finals?.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.390
No choice, mate, I've got
a big, old deficit to tuck into.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.989
And the pub's a place I can...
earn a bit of money, do some revision

00:50.040 --> 00:51.917
and eat a shitload of wasabi peas.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.837
What would you be doing on this estate?.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.156
Handing out prizes at the local fete,
pootling around on

00:57.200 --> 01:00.590
one of those, um, big lawnmowers
that looks like a tiny tractor.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.993
What kind of work?.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.796
I've actually got an ltalian girlfriend,

01:06.840 --> 01:09.877
so I've become much more easy-going
about all that sort of shit.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.072
As long as there's food on the table
and vino in the bottelo,

01:14.120 --> 01:15.792
it's all good.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.718
So, you might prefer a less
socially demanding job, perhaps?.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.435
Well, there's a reason why
Quasimodo worked in the bell tower

01:22.480 --> 01:24.596
and not in the gift shop, isn't there?.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.232
Mm.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.635
Yeah, maybe I'll have a career,
in an office,

01:28.680 --> 01:30.910
where I'll wear a skirt
and have meetings.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.393
- Yes, maybe you will.
- And after work,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.670
go home to my house, in my Volvo,

01:34.720 --> 01:37.712
and put my head in an oven...

01:38.960 --> 01:40.916
...till I'm dead.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.872
Well, maybe best not to put that
on the CV.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.960 --> 02:33.473
Ugh!

02:43.920 --> 02:47.549
Oh, stop fucking fucking him!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.479
VOD: lt'd be fucking boring, though.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.715
HOWARD: Reassuringly boring, yes.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.273
I prefer uncomplicated.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.756
Most of these oil rigs are manned
by Norwegians, who are famously

02:59.800 --> 03:02.234
very plain-speaking and don't bother with

03:02.280 --> 03:05.113
this bourgeois bullshit,
like passive-aggression

03:05.160 --> 03:09.073
or smiling and not being explicitly clear
when they're breaking up with you.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.588
And for that reason alone,
they have my eternal respect.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.870
Why wasn't I given an oil rig?.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.751
I could drive one of them around.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.155
Get it spunking out oil all over the shop.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.714
Yeah, that's generally
the opposite of what they want, JP.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.594
And you can shut up, your brother's
got you with a pre-fab bank job.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.315
It's mooks like me and Howard
with no contacts that are truly shafted.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.918
Yeah, that is true.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.599
But I'm still sick of Tommo's
hand-me-downs.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.077
First the school uniform,
then the ski salopettes, and now the suit.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.196
You know what?. No more.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.834
I don't need his help...
or his clothing.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.552
I'm going my own way...

03:44.600 --> 03:46.113
as of now!

03:47.480 --> 03:48.595
The house isn't that way.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.358
I don't care.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.958
(BEEPS HORN)

03:55.000 --> 03:56.638
Nice wheels, Kingo.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.875
Oh, yeah, it's Rosa's motorino.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.955
It's really cool, actually.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.399
Unless it rains, then it's appalling.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.274
- You look like you're going jousting.
- Oh, yeah, no, just, um...

04:05.320 --> 04:08.471
delivering Rosa's pane e olio lunch.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.718
I'll see you guys later for another voyage
into the revise-o-sphere, though, right?.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.159
Not me, mate, I'll be at the pub.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.633
- Come down if you want.
- Oh, cool.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.079
Can you get us free drinks?.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.793
Um, can Bob the Builder fix it?.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.035
Yes. Famously, he can.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.594
What about Rosa?.
Do we still need her signature?.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.473
Er, not now that she's been transferred
to the Comms department, no.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.670
- You can authorise your own policies.
- Oh, my God!

04:31.720 --> 04:33.392
At last!

04:33.440 --> 04:35.351
I am the law!

04:35.400 --> 04:39.188
I can do whatever the fuck I want
and no-one can stop me! That must be why

04:39.240 --> 04:40.832
- Kim Jong-un has that haircut.
- Well, I mean,

04:40.880 --> 04:42.836
obviously the main thing
we need to decide upon for nex year

04:42.880 --> 04:44.677
- is our...
- Legacy, yes.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.994
I was going to say font, actually.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.314
Henry Kissinger,

04:47.360 --> 04:48.349
John Steinbeck,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.550
Amar Gopal Bose - the founder of Bose.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.352
What do all these people have in common?.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.595
Oh, God, is it marrying their cousins?.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.358
They're all former Fulbright scholars.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.235
They put their heart and soul
into writing and diplomacy and...

05:01.280 --> 05:03.271
well, noise-cancelling headphones.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.709
And if I'm going to follow
in their Fulbright footsteps -

05:05.760 --> 05:07.432
and ideally I am -

05:07.480 --> 05:09.471
I have to lead this university

05:09.520 --> 05:13.115
and give them the leader
that they want, no, deserve.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.515
I'm going to stop the rot and...
and fight for justice

05:15.560 --> 05:17.232
- and...
- Sorry, where are we going?.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.032
Yes, exactly.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.071
To ask, as a university,

05:21.120 --> 05:22.678
- where are we going?.
- Sorry,

05:22.720 --> 05:24.551
I meant right now.
Where are we going?.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.309
Oh. I always go the wrong way
when I walk and talk at the same time.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.477
Shit! I've got to sort this out
if I'm going to work in the States.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.792
What is this, please?.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.709
This is a mood board. I'm assembling
my dream house for nex year.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.150
Say hello to Hartnell,
the nex generation.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.668
- Russell Howard's moving in?.
- No, not...

05:52.720 --> 05:54.073
not the Russell Howard.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.519
A Russell Howard type.

05:55.560 --> 06:00.270
Someone to cast a wry eye over the day's
news while we all have breakfast.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.470
Cooked by Ken Hom, presumably.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.875
Well, yes, exactly, because I thought

06:04.920 --> 06:07.070
it would be really handy to have a chef.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.918
He will literally spice things up
around here.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.188
A young Kate Bush?.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.119
JOSlE: And...and an old Malala.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.152
Because I thought they'd be like
an uber-Vod and Oregon.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.839
It's just a guide,
it doesn't need to be realistic.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.395
No. Apparently the last room's occupied
by a pretend dinosaur.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.273
Barney the Dinosaur, yes.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.639
A Barney figure.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.355
Someone loud and fun.
Someone like JP, just not evil.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.913
Basically, it's a better,

06:33.960 --> 06:37.350
- newer, improved version of us.
- Right.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.391
It feels a bit heartless.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.271
Yeah, well, I'm in a rut, OK?.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.594
A big one.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.711
- Things have to change around here.
- Mm.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.079
And, er, who's the new me?.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.396
Yeah, no... um, except you.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.670
Because you are...

06:52.720 --> 06:54.073
Ken Hom.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.189
What?.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.673
I'm nothing like Ken Hom.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.871
No, no, he's a TV chef
and, you know, he's so...

06:59.920 --> 07:01.353
upbeat.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.714
Upbeat?.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.830
Are you saying I'm not upbeat?.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.156
I mean, I take your point about not being
a TV chef, I'm fine with that,

07:09.200 --> 07:11.589
I've got no illusions
in that department, but...

07:11.640 --> 07:13.790
are you saying I'm downbeat?.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.276
Well, just recently, since you got dumped,
you've been a bit...

07:17.320 --> 07:18.719
Oh.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.193
I see.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.312
And Ken Hom never gets dumped,
I assume, hm?.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.070
Ken Hom never wonders if he'll cope with
the office culture of Ordnance Survey.

07:28.120 --> 07:34.434
Ken Hom never stares at his wok and asks
himself why he even fucking bothers.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.836
I'm going to do this in my room.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.269
Are you sure you don't want
any pane e olio?.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.754
I have McNuggets, thank you.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.477
So, hey, I thought this weekend
we could go to this deli I found

08:00.520 --> 08:03.910
that stocks every shape of pasta
in existence.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.032
My son is coming to stay with me
this weekend, I'm busy.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.196
Sorry, Kingsley, I should have told you.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.798
Oh, right, yeah, I mean...

08:10.840 --> 08:13.035
you probably should have told me
you have a son.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.719
I have a son. His name is Luca.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.036
I didn't tell you because I didn't know
if you could handle it.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.229
I...

08:20.280 --> 08:22.350
I can handle it, this is...

08:22.400 --> 08:24.118
This is great, l...

08:24.160 --> 08:26.720
I think it's great you've got a son,
I actually sort of prefer it.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.591
What?.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.837
Not prefer it, just...
I'm saying I think it's cool.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.871
Sons are cool. I'm a son. I like sons.
I'd like to meet him.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.275
OK, well, no, I don't think so.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.278
- He's having problems in school.
- Well, let me help.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.517
Honestly, Rosa, I know what that's like.
I was bullied when I was eight

08:43.559 --> 08:45.949
and I actually did a bit of bullying
myself when I was 1 1,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.558
so, you know, I've seen both sides.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.832
As a man, a mature man,
I could get through to him.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.391
- Oh, he's a big bugger, isn't he?.
- He is not bullying, huh?.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.953
He's a-saying he doesn't want

09:01.000 --> 09:02.513
- to go to university.
- Right.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.438
So, he's, what, 1 8, is he?.

09:05.480 --> 09:10.508
But I guess you could talk to him,
tell him what it's like, why he should go,

09:10.560 --> 09:13.154
it could be very helpful, actually,
for him to get a perspective

09:13.200 --> 09:16.078
- of someone who's doing it now.
- Yeah, cool.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.669
Is he stood on some sort of box
or hillock in this?.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.075
He is tall, yes.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.235
So, you talk to him, Kingsley, huh?.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.032
- Tell him why it's important.
- Could you maybe

09:25.080 --> 09:26.957
keep the noise down a bit, please, Rosa?.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.754
This is actually a place of work
and not your kitchen, weirdly.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.075
And even though, apparently,
I can't have you fired,

09:33.120 --> 09:36.112
I would still quite like the option
of hearing myself speak. Thanks.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.029
JP: Holy shit!

09:46.360 --> 09:48.112
Kingsley, that's not a stepson,

09:48.160 --> 09:50.628
- that's a stepman.
- Yeah, he's big.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.389
But I figure it'll be easier
for us to bond if he's 1 8.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.432
You know, like, we both love ltaly
and we both love music.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.109
Hm. D'you know what else
1 8-year-old ltalian boys really love?.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.151
People having sex with their mums.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.269
(PHONE RlNGS)

10:04.320 --> 10:05.912
Pronto?.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.599
Oh, not much, just revising, yeah.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.473
Oh, right, really, you're with Luca now?.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.953
K-man's got a son.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.433
Vod's got a pub.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.198
Howie's got an oil rig.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.037
What's JP got?.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.354
Nothing.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.436
Well, maybe cufflinks.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.239
Vod, will you stop reading,
you bloody egghead?.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.238
- I need cheering up.
- You own our house, JP.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.599
You're fine.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.756
It's people like me that are fucked.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.315
Us lot at the bottom
of the property ladder, holding it steady,

10:35.360 --> 10:37.351
while you bastards climb to the top.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.836
Thanks, Vod. Once again, you're spot-on.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.074
I'll think of something.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.519
I mean, look at this.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.189
We give 25 grand a year to the rugby club
to fund their...

10:48.240 --> 10:51.391
aggressively homoerotic outdoor cuddling.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.557
We are throwing cash at those who have it,
and bollocks to the rest.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.716
- Well, no more!
- Yeah.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.830
But not all rugby players are rich.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.270
No offence, but you're Welsh,
and where you're from,

11:02.320 --> 11:05.437
A, everybody loves rugby,
and B, nobody's rich.

11:05.480 --> 11:10.031
In England, rugby fans wear Barbours
and drive to Twickers in their Land Rovers

11:10.080 --> 11:11.559
and do not deserve union funding.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.070
Yes, wicked. If this is about
shitting on JP, I'm all over it.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.348
Oh, well, I mean, sort of...

11:16.400 --> 11:20.439
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair that rugby
gets more compared to, um...

11:20.480 --> 11:22.710
judo or poetry,

11:22.760 --> 11:26.070
- or the Naturist Society.
- Did you say poetry?.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.951
Josie, that's it!

11:28.000 --> 11:29.479
Poetry.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.875
That's my noise-cancelling headphones.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.117
- Yes! What?.
- I'm going to rob rugby to pay poetry.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.950
I'm going to cut that bastard sport like
it's getting a crewcut on the Cutty Sark.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.117
Keep an eye on the bar, Vod.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.589
This is an impressive pub, to be fair.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.154
Just dried my hands using
two separate Dyson Airblades.

11:49.200 --> 11:54.228
Yes, and this Randy Dragon craft lPA
is like drinking a liquid cake.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.636
Another free pint of it, please,
your Vodjesty.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.795
I just gave you one.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.912
- Yes, and now I would like another one.
- Me too, please, Vod.

12:01.960 --> 12:02.995
Yeah.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.634
- Hang on.
- Or you could just pop that barrel

12:05.680 --> 12:08.069
- up on the bar and we'll help ourselves.
- Or we could take it home.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.076
If you can't do it, Vod, don't worry.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.955
No, no, I can. Course I can.
Just can't take the piss, that's all.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.718
Don't tell me Vod's scared
of getting in trouble.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.469
As if! Trouble's scared of me, more like.
Right, what we havin'?.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.272
Smirnoff lce, please.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.276
That was Rosa, bit of a situation.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.392
- I'm not taking her back, Kingsley.
- No, it's not that, it's, um...

12:27.440 --> 12:30.989
her son, Luca, thinks that he might not
go to university nex year,

12:31.040 --> 12:33.793
so I said he could come round ours
to see what it's like.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.319
What what's like?.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.238
I guess being a student,
the whole shared house thing.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.999
What, you mean three years cohabiting
with people you think like you

12:41.040 --> 12:43.031
and then discover
they'd rather you were Ken Hom.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.640
Oh, Howard, you're making something
out of nothing.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.113
Oh, am l?.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.390
Oh, a bit like Ken Hom
on Ready Steady Cook.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.829
Oh, my God, Vod, can you get Howard
another pint, please?.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.111
I'm going to airlift you out of these
doldrums, Howard, as of now.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.116
VOD: Coming right up.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.628
KlNGSLEY: So, you'll be nice to him, yeah,
guys?. Show him we're cool,

12:59.680 --> 13:01.636
- being at uni's cool.
- We're like a six-headed

13:01.680 --> 13:05.229
advert for university right here.
I mean, look at us.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.272
If we can't convince him that being
a student's cool, then nothing will.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.357
OK, great, so I'll bring him round
tomorrow, about three?.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.389
OK.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.512
I am actually auditioning some potential
new housemates tomorrow,

13:15.560 --> 13:16.629
but it should be OK.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.477
Does Luca know
you're knobbing Mummy Bear?.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.748
Yeah, er, no.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.473
Er, but it's all good.
We've decided not to tell him.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.953
OK, that's mature!

13:24.000 --> 13:26.798
Ha, I see -
the woman drinking Smirnoff lce

13:26.840 --> 13:31.436
is calling the man drinking Campari
immature. Nice!

13:31.480 --> 13:34.756
It'll be fine. I know what I'm doing.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.313
Ugh!

13:38.760 --> 13:42.116
I've whittled it down to four jobs
that I would do.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.628
Number one - spy.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.238
Please could I become a spy?.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.032
Well, do you speak any languages?.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.559
Yeah, this one - English.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.511
Ooh, and I'm really good at accents.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.630
Though I imagine that's probably
not as good.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.238
Let's hear your other ideas.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.999
Tennis umpire, brackets, women's.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.191
- Three - spaceman.
- That's not realistic.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.719
Yeah, sure.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.035
- Bloody unmanned probes.
- Jonathan, rather than

14:05.080 --> 14:09.198
working through your... napkin, why don't
you tell me what you'd like to get out of

14:09.240 --> 14:12.038
a future career and then maybe
we can work backwards?.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.354
Sweet!

14:13.400 --> 14:15.391
Um, well...

14:15.440 --> 14:20.468
first up, my brother would have to
absolutely shit his pants with envy,

14:20.520 --> 14:22.158
if envy can make you do that.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.873
OK, we can come back to that.
What about what you need?.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.673
What I need?. 1 50, 1 20 minimum,

14:27.720 --> 14:29.756
- company car...
- No, no, I mean emotionally.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.873
What is it...?. Sorry, do you mean £1 50,000
when you say 1 50?.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.036
Yeah, excluding bonuses, obv.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.354
That's not going to happen.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.119
None of the jobs you mentioned
pay anything like that much.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.355
Spaceman, spy, none of them.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.871
Sorry, you think James Bond is earning
less than 1 50K a year?.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.354
- He's not real, though, is he?.
- You think he's stood at the bar,

14:49.400 --> 14:52.312
flicking through his wallet wondering
if he can afford another vodka martini

14:52.360 --> 14:54.112
or if he has to switch to Foster's?.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.357
- Come on, mate.
- The average starting salary

14:57.400 --> 15:01.473
for the UK graduate is currently
just under £22,000, Jonathan.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.798
Well, I'm afraid that simply won't do.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.796
- What does that mean?.
- What it means

15:07.840 --> 15:10.035
is that I have a lifestyle to maintain.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.913
I'm very much a resident of Easy Street.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.192
My address is essentially
Number 1, Easy Street, London.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.549
I need a job that befits that -

15:19.600 --> 15:24.196
a job that is fun, simple
and, above all, exremely well paid.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.118
I'm sorry to say,
none of those jobs are the answer.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.434
I haven't finished.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.034
Four - head chef.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.230
- Can you cook?.
- Not really, no.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.032
OK.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.831
OK, so, this is the kitchen.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.599
Er, just ignore Vod,
she won't be here nex year,

15:45.640 --> 15:47.995
unless her exams go really fucking badly,
eh, Vod?.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.033
Oh, no, one of my housemates
has left the milk out.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.354
Oh!

15:53.400 --> 15:54.753
You just did that.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.916
I really hate it when people do that.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.958
Shall I put it back in the fridge?.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.031
You do whatever feels right, Helen.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.599
(FRlDGE DOOR OPENS)

16:13.840 --> 16:15.159
I'm Helen, by the way.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.236
Oh, sod this, I can't work
under these conditions!

16:17.280 --> 16:18.952
Going to pub.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.718
Cool, I'll see you there in a bit.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.758
- Oh, will you?.
- Yeah,

16:23.800 --> 16:25.916
I'm helping Howard to cheer up.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.712
By taking him to the pub at 1 1 am?.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.196
I mean, isn't that just
a really fucking terrible idea?.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.277
Not when your totally badass housemate's
supplying all the drinks.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.958
Yeah, Jose, look, about that...

16:36.000 --> 16:40.357
Vod is a legend in this house.
She can get you anything you want.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.790
(CHUCKLES)

16:43.840 --> 16:46.035
Helen, cup of tea?.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.479
Oh, yeah, great, thanks.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.670
It's all out there
and mine's milk with one.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.471
Oh, hi, sorry.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.910
Hey, Kingsley, just showing Helen
the, er, kitchen.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.871
And getting her to make the tea.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.717
- If you want one too...
- Er, yeah, thanks.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.228
Milk, no sugar, please.
Quite a lot of milk, though.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.473
So, um...

17:04.520 --> 17:07.353
Colour-wise, probably somewhere between
beech and young pine.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.799
(CLATTERlNG)

17:13.599 --> 17:15.670
Are you tidying down?.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.233
- That is insane.
- Yeah, I just don't want

17:17.280 --> 17:18.872
Luca to think we're, like, squares.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.959
Anyway, what are you doing?.
Why is she making you tea?.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.434
I've had to put up with Oregon's
scummy tea for three years,

17:25.480 --> 17:26.878
I'm not going through that again.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.559
Anyway, you can tell a lot about a person
by their tea.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.875
Yours, for example, tastes very selfish.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.558
Here you go.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.956
I didn't have my wood wallchart with me,
I'm afraid, so I just sort of made yours

17:37.000 --> 17:39.719
- the same colour as Jennifer Aniston.
- (KlNGSLEY LAUGHS)

17:39.760 --> 17:41.239
Great, thank you.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.029
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.271
- Ta-da!
- Oh.

17:57.320 --> 18:01.074
- Right...wow.
- I'm bringing poetry back.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.439
- Hard.
- Yeah.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.313
Er, what is the prize, exactly?.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.238
Well, poetry is in many ways
its own prize, Nas,

18:08.280 --> 18:13.195
but specifically it's £20,000
and a week at a poetry retreat, yes.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.390
- Oh, fuck! OK.
- But the second prize

18:15.440 --> 18:18.000
- is only three.
- Yeah. We can't do that.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.519
Well, we are doing it.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.393
I've already commissioned a Perspex
award in the shape of a comma.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.873
No, I mean the money. That...

18:23.920 --> 18:26.434
And I've ordered a massive novelty cheque,
like the ones supermarkets use

18:26.480 --> 18:27.469
when they donate to Comic Relief.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.272
We just can't afford it. I mean,

18:29.320 --> 18:30.719
there's no way
we can give away that kind of money.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.352
Stop telling me what to do.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.038
I am your leader.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.834
I've been elected to do things,
and things is what I'm going to do.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.235
If Joanna Lumley can build
a garden on a bridge,

18:40.280 --> 18:42.077
then I should have my poetry prize.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.989
£20,000 would make it the most lucrative
poetry prize in the UK by five grand.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.712
Good.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.830
No, it's not good, we can't afford it.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.233
We can.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.599
I've made some cuts.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.278
Some absolute swinges.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.630
No longer will we blindly fund
three bloody rugby teams

18:58.680 --> 19:01.274
for a bunch of loaded, landed toffs.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.551
The egg-chasers are on their own
and I've issued a press release

19:04.600 --> 19:07.239
that displays that
both cleverly and hilariously.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.918
You can't just cut rugby.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.599
Well, I can. I have. It's done.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.154
- Well, they'll crucify you for this.
- Perhaps they will.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.634
And let's just say, I won't be
the first person to be crucified

19:16.680 --> 19:17.908
for trying to do something good.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.840
Sorry, are you comparing yourself
to Christ now?.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.475
No, I'm not comparing, just alluding.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.114
It's a subtle difference and one that,
if you read more poetry,

19:29.160 --> 19:30.832
you would understand.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.314
That's the secret to good boozing -
a sweet spot.

19:39.640 --> 19:44.430
The magic mark where your worries have
gone, but your faculties haven't.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.119
And boom, you're one chipper chappie.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.754
Right, and how much would that
normally require?.

19:49.800 --> 19:54.032
In my experience, it's almost always £25,
no matter what you buy.

19:54.080 --> 19:59.552
Because, like, in terms of quantity
of booze, £25 sounds quite a lot.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.512
It's fine, the government says
that seven pints a day is fine.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.357
- Do they?.
- Yeah.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.073
Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.793
Look, don't overthink it. OK?.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.592
It's easy to know when to stop drinking

20:11.640 --> 20:15.952
because your body has a sort of fail-safe,
like, um, your hand goes all floppy,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.514
so you can't hold the glass,
or your mouth goes weird

20:18.560 --> 20:20.516
and the woman in the offy
can't understand you.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.279
If you think about it, Howie,
you can't really drink too much,

20:23.320 --> 20:24.833
because you pass out.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.313
Nature will look after you.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.476
Yeah, I do feel considerably

20:28.520 --> 20:31.478
- more relaxed now.
- Yeah, damn straight.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.635
And we've only just started.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.318
Two more pints, please, Vod.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.152
Er...yeah.

20:38.480 --> 20:44.715
Just...could one of you maybe pretend to
give me money in case Reuben's watching?.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.188
Oh, my God! They're coming.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.231
Everyone, just do what you normally do.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.196
Er, so, everyone, this is Luca.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.514
Luca, everyone.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.958
Just ignore that guy, Luca,
he's just here about renting a room.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.275
- OK.
- So, welcome to the madhouse.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.788
Sorry about the mess,
we weren't expecting anyone.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.796
What's your poison, Luca?.
We've got wine, we've got beer.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.434
Well, it's only, like, 3pm, so...

21:23.480 --> 21:26.631
- Pimm's o'clock. Good man.
- No, I just mean, it's quite early.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.877
Not for us lads,
cos we're on it dawn till dusk.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.151
And of course after dusk,
because then it's the evening.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.193
We do also sometimes get our geek on,
despite the obvious party vibes,

21:37.240 --> 21:39.708
it's not all one long boozy fuckfest.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.992
But it mainly is. You should ask Vod,
she's our resident Gazza.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.189
Right, Vod?.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.719
Vod?.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.159
Huh?.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.395
Yeah. Whatever.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.955
Can you, er, keep it down a bit?.
I'm trying to do my dissertation.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.275
Yeah, right, good one, classic.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.517
So, Luca, the word on the street
is that you're after the 41 1

21:59.560 --> 22:02.233
of what being a student is all about,
am I right?.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.508
Yeah, sort of.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.596
Well, I'm the president of the union
here in Manchester,

22:05.640 --> 22:07.870
- so I know a thing or two about that.
- Are you the one

22:07.920 --> 22:09.399
that tried to fire my mum?.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.029
I am, actually, yeah.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.756
Um, but I don't want to go into details,
but I'm afraid your mother is a traitor.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.950
Let's not get bogged down in that,
let's just give him a sense

22:19.000 --> 22:20.115
- of what it's like.
- OK, Luca,

22:20.160 --> 22:23.436
you definitely want to go
to university, it's amazing.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.119
You get really pissed,
you work really hard

22:26.160 --> 22:27.878
and you have sex with people

22:27.920 --> 22:31.356
that you won't like at all,
but in a really fun way.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.313
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of faeces
that goes along with it, obviously.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.828
Local people hate you. Nightlife's jizz,

22:37.880 --> 22:39.438
the societies are fucking lame,

22:39.480 --> 22:41.471
tutors don't give a shit
and you're always broke.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.714
But, er...

22:45.680 --> 22:48.240
Er...fuck, I can't remember
what the "but" was.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.357
Anyway, I guess it's only three years.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.833
Yeah.

22:52.880 --> 22:56.509
Sorry, guys, I think my mum might have
given you the wrong idea.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.755
I mean, it's not that
I don't want to go to uni,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.472
it's more that I just don't see the point.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.079
Go on, this'll be good.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.953
Well, I had offers from two places
to do food science,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.116
but I've no idea if the courses
are actually any good,

23:08.160 --> 23:09.957
or what I do after.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.390
The only thing I know for sure is
I come out of it with a huge fucking debt.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.352
And probably have to work as a pot washer
in some kitchen somewhere.

23:16.400 --> 23:20.154
But you'll have a degree, Luca,
that's worth, you know, a lot.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.679
But why, though?.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.836
How's it going to be useful to me later?.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.791
What do you want to do?.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.070
Well, um, I don't know.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.475
Perhaps work in radio or something.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.909
- And you study...?.
- Geology, yeah.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.791
Well, exactly.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.752
So what's the point?.
How's your geology degree

23:37.800 --> 23:39.791
going to help you with that?.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.831
It's just that you've got
some piece of paper

23:41.880 --> 23:44.189
that's cost a huge chunk
of your future earnings

23:44.240 --> 23:45.719
which will probably be shit anyway.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.070
You never know, you might become
a famous recording artist.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.913
Just fucking with you, Kingsley.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.430
- (JOSlE LAUGHS)
- Kingsley.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.313
Yes, sorry, no,
just had a tiny panic attack there.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.830
I mean, I see what you're saying,
Luca, but that is wrong.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.030
- You do need a degree.
- I definitely do.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.991
I'm going to study
in the States after this.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.589
That's fine, but you can't do that
for ever, you can't just keep studying.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.959
Actually, yes, you can.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.551
If you seriously injure someone
in your practical, you can repeat a year.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.910
But I mean long-term, though,
you're putting all this time and money

24:19.960 --> 24:22.633
into a system that might have
nothing for you.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.717
The number of unemployed
graduates is going up.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.716
Starting salaries are going down.

24:27.760 --> 24:33.312
UK industries are outsourcing, downsizing,
so they reckon it'll take 30 years

24:33.360 --> 24:36.955
for the average student
to pay off their student loan.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.594
- What?.
- And that's if you even get a job.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.791
Luca, sweetheart,
once I have my sushi restaurant,

24:42.840 --> 24:46.116
you can come and put the soy sauce
in the little plastic fish or something.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.195
What are you on about?.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.593
I'm going to be a sashimi master.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.915
- Have you got training in that, then?.
- No.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.076
But I have got an excellent set of knives.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.793
- Because it takes, like, 1 0 years.
- Ridiculous!

24:57.120 --> 25:00.874
And here... is your tea.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.229
Oh, my God, have you left the bag in?.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.913
Is... is that not right?.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.313
Get out, you pervert!

25:10.240 --> 25:14.631
The thing is, Luca, university gives you
really valuable life experience

25:14.680 --> 25:16.272
that you wouldn't get otherwise

25:16.320 --> 25:17.799
- at home or...
- Look, I'm going

25:17.840 --> 25:21.310
to move to Seoul for three years, learn
Korean and try and get work out there.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.112
- Do that, go to Korea.
- Sounds amazing.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.310
It can't be that simple, though, can it?.
You can't just go to Korea.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.478
I don't... I don't remember that being
an option on the fucking UCAS form.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.431
You can't just do that.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.879
- Maybe I should go to Korea.
- No, no,

25:32.920 --> 25:34.990
no, stop it,
because this is what you do.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.237
You go to school, then you leave,
then you go to uni, that's...

25:38.280 --> 25:41.829
There are...there are reasons for this.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.832
I haven't just wasted three years
of my fucking life for no reason.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.678
I'd say, if you want to work in radio,
you definitely have wasted it.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.598
No, Luca, just...just shut up.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.349
My God, how can it take 1 0 years
to learn how to cut up a fucking tuna?.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.311
But geology is safe.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.272
My mum said it was safe,
it's a safe degree.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.515
Rocks are safe.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.788
I think he's going to be sick,
pass the cone.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.558
Unless there's something I'm not seeing,
Kingsley,

26:07.600 --> 26:10.034
unless there's something special about uni

26:10.080 --> 26:12.230
- that I don't know.
- Yeah, there is actually, mate.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.111
I'm fucking your mum.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.710
Oh!

26:16.760 --> 26:17.829
- What?.
- Yeah.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.475
You come in here, all clever, with
your thick eyebrows and your cool name,

26:21.520 --> 26:23.829
shitting on everything with your facts.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.633
Well, yes, I am...

26:27.840 --> 26:30.354
...in a relationship with your mum.

26:30.400 --> 26:35.076
And I thought now would be a good
and mature time to tell you.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.073
Ugh!

Are you going to get that?.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.389
Um, no.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.749
You're going to have to face her
at some point.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.438
Yeah, I'm also going to
have to die at some point,

27:04.480 --> 27:06.994
doesn't mean I have to do it now
just because it has to happen anyway.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.315
When you speak to her,
can you tell her from me

27:09.360 --> 27:11.191
that her son is an absolute rotter?.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.310
Sushi was my last hope.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.952
Now I haven't got that,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.551
I'm doomed to become one of those very
smart tramps you see outside a chemist.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.160
Can you shut up, please, JP?.

27:22.200 --> 27:26.273
I keep accidentally writing words
you're saying in my dissertation.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.197
I just called Hemingway a rotter,

27:28.240 --> 27:32.233
which, thinking about it,
is actually fine.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.477
Oh, everything's fine for you,
you've got a job.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.590

like Deborah fucking Meaden.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.317
Pronto?.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.958
OK, sorry, fine.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.479
Hi.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.478
For the record, JP,
I'm in a slightly different Venn,

27:58.520 --> 28:02.752
given that I'm union president and I'm
launching an amazing new poetry prize

28:02.800 --> 28:05.519
that's going to inspire
and energise all of us.

28:05.560 --> 28:10.236
I mean, not rubbing it in or anything,
but my CV is basically bombproof.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.033
Whereas mine will look like
a poster for a lost dog.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.629
Just take the bank job, then, JP.
The suit is clearly your destiny.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.389
I can't wear the suit
because I sashimied the suit.

28:20.440 --> 28:24.592
If I put it on, I'd look like I was
in an explosion in a cartoon.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.629

28:25.680 --> 28:28.717

31:09.880 --> 31:12.155
- I did.
- And how did that go?.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.270
Well, what did Luca say?.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.550
He didn't. He called me a paedophile
for 40 minutes

31:16.600 --> 31:18.352
and then he drove back to his father's.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.118
Well, it went really well, in that case.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.948
He had one logistical question
that I wanted to ask you about.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.788
If it turns out that someone realises
that they're doing the wrong course

31:27.840 --> 31:30.274
and that they actually hate it
and don't want to work in it,

31:30.320 --> 31:33.357
- can they get their money back?.
- That is so typical Luca.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.868
He never commits to anything.

31:35.920 --> 31:40.550
I know, yeah, so if he did drop out, um,
in his final term, say,

31:40.600 --> 31:44.957
could he, um...would you still have to pay
for the full three years?.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.355
- Yes. Of course.
- What if it was a mistake?.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.154
Studying a subject that you hate
for three years is not a mistake.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.351
- Yes, but I think maybe it can be.
- No, no,

31:54.400 --> 31:59.190
a mistake is like a-slipping on ice
or buying a hat that is too small.

31:59.240 --> 32:04.360
No, you are talking about a gross error in
judgment, followed by years of cowardice.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.515
No, I suppose I am.

32:05.560 --> 32:09.269
And no-one would expect to get their
money back, no, no, this would be entirely

32:09.320 --> 32:12.630
Luca's responsibility and I would insist
that he finish his degree.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.677
What's that?. Who is that cheque for?.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.753
It's for someone called
Mr Mind Your Own Fucking Business

32:21.800 --> 32:23.119
You Don't Work For Me Any More.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.832
Why aren't there more people?.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.154
Did you tweet about this?.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.272
Yes. I alerted all of your 27 followers.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.835
Piece...of...shit.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.958
Nas, could you do something about that?.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.399
Like what?.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.950
- Deploy the student union tanks?.
- Oh, my God!

32:53.000 --> 32:54.194
Oh, my God!

32:54.240 --> 32:56.390
- Who's the egg-chaser now?.
- Sorry. Fucking hell!

32:56.440 --> 32:58.476
Nas, do something.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.476
Stop it! Nas, do something about this.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.909
NAS: Well, don't open another box.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.469
What's that?.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.318
That is Ken Hom stir-fried
chicken and chilli with basil.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.316
I thought it might help
with your hangover.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.429
Thank you.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.233
And, er, sorry for being leery
at your new housemates.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.555
I put them off moving in with me
anyway, apparently.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.558
I was, and I quote,
"overbearing and unbearable".

33:22.600 --> 33:24.591
I've decided to send drunk Howard
back to Siberia.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.189
Although he may be more chatty
and better at wordplay than l,

33:28.240 --> 33:30.879
he is, nevertheless, a bit of a dick.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.196
- Yeah.
- And while sober Howard faces a lifetime

33:34.240 --> 33:38.233
of struggling to understand humans
and their subtex and sport,

33:38.280 --> 33:43.195
I kind of know where I stand with him,
as in, me, and I don't hate it,

33:43.240 --> 33:47.279
hence why I've decided to apply
for the Ordnance Survey job.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.515
Attaboy, Howard! OK.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.116
Right, question number one.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.197
Do you thrive on being relied upon?.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.389
Er, no.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.797
- OK, I'm just going to put yes for that.
- Hm.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.159
Question two?.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.758
Reasons for applying.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.918
Um, that is an incredibly
complicated question, um...

34:09.960 --> 34:11.916
I'm just going to put "love of maps".

34:13.920 --> 34:18.391
Six broken glasses, three broken chairs,
then there's the free drinks.

34:18.440 --> 34:22.638
In total, we're talking 380 quid.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.318
Please don't fire me, OK?.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.830
Reuben, I really need this job and, um...

34:27.880 --> 34:31.509
Then nothing like this
can ever happen again.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.438
I'm taking it out of your wages
until you're square.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.993
Thank you, Reuben.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.032
Look, I won't let you down, I promise.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.311
I'm really looking forward to the meeting,
bro, big-time.

34:42.360 --> 34:46.478
You tell Jonty Bonty that Prentice Junior
is climbing aboard HMS Moneybags

34:46.520 --> 34:48.670
and getting the fuck out of Dunkirk.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.556
There is just one tiny problem
with the suit.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.319
#...smoking up the sky, yeah

34:58.640 --> 35:04.715
# Crazy horses all got riders
and they're you and I

35:06.480 --> 35:07.959
# Crazy horses... #

35:08.000 --> 35:09.672
I've only gone and done it again!

35:09.720 --> 35:12.678
I have nicked a barrel of beer.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.199
Oi, everyone!

35:15.240 --> 35:17.390
# Never stop and they never die

35:17.440 --> 35:21.672
# They just keep on puffin '
How they multiply

35:22.840 --> 35:26.230
# Crazy horses, will they never halt...?. #

35:26.280 --> 35:28.236
- (CLANKlNG)
- # If they keep on movin '

35:28.280 --> 35:30.874
- # Then it's all our fault... #
- Ohh!

35:30.920 --> 35:32.114
Holy shit!

35:32.160 --> 35:34.754
- Is that your bathwater?.
- Randy Dragon.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.838
A little house gift from me.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.394
- I just cracked it open like a big egg.
- What happened

35:40.440 --> 35:43.000
- to the whole "needing a job" thing?.
- I did, mate.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.952
I told them to shove it up
their jacks, didn't l?.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.551
Like, put this bird in a cage and she will
bend the bars with her beak

35:50.600 --> 35:52.158
and nick the cuttlefish.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.952
It's what I do.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.558
She's back.

35:55.600 --> 36:00.549
Everyone, Vod's back
and she's brought booze.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.068
Yes, vintage Vod.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.872
It's like you read my mind.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.478
HOWARD: Why can I smell beer?.

36:06.520 --> 36:09.193
I've tipped a barrel of beer in the tub,
Howard.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.434
On my way.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.275
Oh, God, why have you done this?.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.153
I want to just have a bath
and just bang out my dissertation.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.316
Pissertation, more like!

36:19.360 --> 36:20.554
Great.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.830
Look, we've got
a bath of booze on our hands here,

36:22.880 --> 36:25.030
so you need to get
with the fucking programme, Oregon,

36:25.080 --> 36:28.038
because this is what
being at university is all about.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.231
Exactly. I wish Luca could see this,
the smug little shit.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.679
So, ciao, Luca, Kingsley here.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.678
Just to let you know that being at uni
is really rubbish.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.234
Look, we've got a bath full of beer!

36:42.280 --> 36:44.111
(CHEERlNG)

36:44.160 --> 36:47.277
KlNGSLEY: What a shame.
Good luck getting that in Korea, you twat.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.676
This is what you're missing out on, Luca,
you lanky bitch.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.915
Hi, Luca! So...

36:52.960 --> 36:56.191
"Air pollution,
particularly vehicle pollution,

36:56.240 --> 36:59.118
"is an increasing problem in Seoul

36:59.160 --> 37:04.029
"because this can cause minor respiratory
problems, such as sinusitis, dry throat

37:04.080 --> 37:11.111
"and irritated eyes," so good luck trying
to breathe in Korea, Luca, you idiot.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.515
Um, Luca, I forgive you for punching me,
by the way.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.551
Don't show this to your mum, please, mate.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.270
I'm going to love it, aren't l?.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.756
Tommo says they've got
a free 24-hour canteen.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.074
Whisky lounge.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.272
Sleeping pods for pulling all-nighters.
That'll be fun, won't it?.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.630
Fun, worky, boozy sleepovers.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.159
What are you doing?.

37:36.200 --> 37:40.113
OK, I need you to stop talking now.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.479
Right, but...

37:43.240 --> 37:45.913
Look, I know
I said last time was the last time,

37:45.960 --> 37:48.394
but it's actually this time, definitely.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.317
(MUFFLED MUMBLlNG)
