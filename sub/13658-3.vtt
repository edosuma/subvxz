YEAH, I'M FORBIDDEN
FROM TALKING ABOUT MY BOSS --

09:34.708 --> 09:38.343
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT,
IRONCLAD, SORRY.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.779
MS. BREWSTER'S DEAD,
SO WHO'S YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER?

09:40.781 --> 09:44.816
[ SIGHS ]
AGAIN, THAT'S A BIG NO-NO.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.818
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO PAYS YOU
FOR LIVING IN A MANSION

09:46.820 --> 09:48.620
AND <i>NOT</i> TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE OF A DOG?

09:48.622 --> 09:51.156
<i>WHOA. HEY, THAT HURTS. I DID</i>
<i>THE BEST I COULD FOR FALCON.</i>

09:51.158 --> 09:53.858
YOU KNOW, LISTENING TO HIM
BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.
<i>AND MY CONFIDENTIALITY</i>
<i>AGREEMENT</i>

09:53.860 --> 09:57.028
<i>IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED</i>
<i>TO MY NEW EMPLOYER...</i>
<i>REALLY HORRIBLE MEMORIES.</i>

09:57.030 --> 09:58.730
...THE MOMENT THAT MS. BREWSTER
<i>WAS DECLARED DEAD.</i>
<i>YOU HAD TO TALK TO HIM.</i>

09:58.732 --> 10:00.832
<i>AND I CAN TELL YOU</i>
<i>EVERYTHING I DID FOR FALCON,</i>

10:00.834 --> 10:02.500
OR WE CAN TALK ABOUT MY DUTIES
AT THE ESTATE,

10:02.502 --> 10:04.235
LIKE TURNING ON
THE GIANT NEON LIGHTS AT NIGHT,

10:04.237 --> 10:05.837
BRUSHING
THE STUFFED HORSES --

10:05.839 --> 10:08.106
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY
FOR WHOM.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.841
THAT IS CORRECT.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.410
AND LISTEN, I AM EVERY BIT
AS IRRITATED BY THIS SITUATION

10:12.412 --> 10:14.412
AS YOU ARE
BECAUSE I POSSESS INFORMATION

10:14.414 --> 10:17.282
THAT COULD BE VITAL TO MOVING
YOUR INVESTIGATION FORWARD.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.783
<i>IF ONLY WE COULD...</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:21.987
<i>GUESS THE PROPER LINE</i>
<i>OF INQUIRY?</i>

10:21.989 --> 10:23.588
WHAT IS THIS,
20 QUESTIONS?

10:23.590 --> 10:24.823
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT WERE SOME

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
OF YOUR OTHER DUTIES
AROUND THE HOUSE?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.793
NO. YOU'RE COLD --
VERY COLD.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.196
HOW OFTEN DID YOU TAKE THE DOG
OUT FOR A WALK?

10:31.198 --> 10:34.733
COLDER.
ICY, EVEN, JUST -- BRR-RR-RR!

10:34.735 --> 10:36.301
OKAY, IF THIS WAS A JOB,
HOW DID YOU GET PAID?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.136
HOT! SCORCHING HOT!
OH!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.471
I WOULD EVEN SAY
THAT YOU ARE

10:39.473 --> 10:42.073
<i>RIGHT ON THE MONEY.</i>
<i>HOW DO I GET PAID?</i>

10:42.075 --> 10:45.410
OKAY, SO, THAT CRAB CAKE
THAT DICK TRACY FED THE DOG,

10:45.412 --> 10:47.946
SIR, WAS SHOT THROUGH
WITH ARSENIC.
<i>I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT,</i>
<i>OF COURSE.</i>

10:47.948 --> 10:51.416
CRAP. DICK WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT FALCON.
<i>BUT IF YOU SUBPOENA</i>
<i>MY BANK RECORDS...</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:52.884
JUST HOLD ON.
ARSENIC?

10:53.552 --> 10:55.286
WELL,
WHERE'S THE OLD LACE?

10:55.288 --> 10:57.622
W-WHO USES ARSENIC
IN THIS DAY AND AGE?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.591
I'LL CALL
THE CORONER'S OFFICE, SIR,

10:59.593 --> 11:01.593
GET THEM STARTED
ON EXHUMING MS. BREWSTER'S BODY.

11:01.595 --> 11:02.961
AH, I THINK
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.930
MS. BREWSTER WAS CREMATED
IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEATH.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.532
"MARCELLA BREWSTER.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.835
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU,
SO I'M COMING BACK FOR IT."

11:10.837 --> 11:14.372
HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE
ARSENIC POISONING WITH THIS?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.374
<i>CHECK MY CHECKS,</i>
<i>CRIMESTOPPERS.</i>

11:16.376 --> 11:18.643
<i>THE CASE WILL</i>
<i>PRACTICALLY SOLVE ITSELF.</i>

11:23.816 --> 11:25.717
SO, THE GOOD NEWS IS
LIEUTENANT FLYNN SAID

11:25.719 --> 11:27.118
IT LOOKS LIKE
MY MOM'S GONNA MAKE IT.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.820
I ALSO SAID
IT'S A DAY-TO-DAY THING.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.690
BUT WHEN SHE GETS OUT OF REHAB
AND MOVES INTO A HALFWAY HOUSE,

11:31.692 --> 11:34.726
SHE'S GOING TO NEED SUPPORT,
FINANCIALLY.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.729
LOOK, I-I HAVE TO GO TO WORK
SOONER OR LATER, RIGHT?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.864
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY
GENEROUS THOUGHT.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.501
I THINK ANDY MAY HAVE
SOME INSIGHT HERE.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.371
IF YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA STAY
SOBER, SHE'S GONNA NEED TO LEARN

11:46.373 --> 11:48.773
HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HERSELF.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.775
YEAH, YEAH,
BUT I WANT TO HELP HER

11:50.777 --> 11:53.144
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HERSELF.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.214
LET'S TRY THIS -- DOWNLOAD SOME
PART-TIME JOB APPLICATIONS,

11:56.216 --> 11:59.651
WEEKEND WORK ONLY, AND LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO DO.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.953
SO, YES?
SO, MAYBE.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.622
[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

12:04.624 --> 12:06.391
[ TELEPHONE RINGING ]

12:06.393 --> 12:11.563
MARCELLA BREWSTER, BORN 1924,
DIED MAY 11, 2014,

12:11.565 --> 12:14.099
AND THIS IS HER MALTESE,
FALCON.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.767
LAST YEAR,
MS. BREWSTER'S FORTUNE

12:15.769 --> 12:18.803
WAS ESTIMATED
AT $300 MILLION.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.338
MARCELLA'S
ONLY HUMAN HEIRS --

12:20.340 --> 12:21.973
GREAT-NEPHEW
CARTER BRADFORD

12:21.975 --> 12:24.342
AND GREAT-NIECE
DEVIN BREWSTER DUNCAN --

12:24.344 --> 12:25.844
WERE GIVEN $1,000 EACH.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.645
WHY ONLY $1,000?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.647
LEAVING A TOKEN AMOUNT
TO AN HEIR

12:29.649 --> 12:32.283
IS ONE WAY TO PREVENT A WILL
FROM BEING CHALLENGED IN COURT.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.452
UNSURPRISINGLY,
CARTER AND DEVIN

12:34.454 --> 12:36.688
HAVE LAWSUITS ALREADY PENDING,
ANYWAY.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.690
THE BULK OF THE ESTATE
WAS LEFT TO BE MANAGED

12:38.692 --> 12:40.391
BY E.M. HOLDINGS
INTERNATIONAL,

12:40.393 --> 12:41.726
WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING
MR. BAIRD --

12:41.728 --> 12:44.429
A.K.A. DICK TRACY --
FOR MONTHS.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.598
SO WE CAN ASSUME
THAT E.M. HOLDINGS MAINTAINS

12:46.600 --> 12:49.534
THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
THAT MR. BAIRD SIGNED.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.669
MAYBE THEY'RE
INCORPORATED ABROAD.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.871
I'LL RUN THE NAME
THROUGH INTERPOL

12:52.873 --> 12:54.272
AND SEE
WHAT THEY COME UP WITH.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.808
JULIO,
WHAT ABOUT THE CRAB CAKES?

12:56.810 --> 12:58.510
Sanchez: AH,
SPECIALTY ITEM, MA'AM,

12:58.512 --> 13:00.311
MANUFACTURED
BY PROSPECT BAY CRABS

13:00.313 --> 13:02.013
AND SHIPPED FROZEN
FROM BALTIMORE.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.015
OKAY, SO,
WHOEVER POISONED THE CRAB CAKES

13:04.017 --> 13:06.551
HAD TO HAVE HAD ACCESS
TO MS. BREWSTER'S KITCHEN.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.420
WHILE WE CAN'T CONFIRM
MARCELLA WAS POISONED

13:09.422 --> 13:12.257
WITHOUT A TISSUE SAMPLE,
THIS IS INTERESTING.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.626
HMM?
MARCELLA'S MEDICAL RECORDS SHOW
THAT SHE'D BEEN SUFFERING

13:14.628 --> 13:17.195
FROM AN ACUTE
PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA,

13:17.197 --> 13:18.229
A CANCER
OF THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.898
GOD.
CAN WE AUDIT THIS COURSE?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.601
ONE OF THE TREATMENTS FOR APL
IS ARSENIC TRIOXIDE,

13:23.603 --> 13:25.170
WHICH SHE'D BEEN TAKING
INTRAVENOUSLY.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.172
Flynn: YOU KNOW,
IF THE KILLER KNEW THAT MARCELLA

13:27.174 --> 13:30.708
WAS ON AN ARSENIC-BASED DRUG,
MAYBE HE OR SHE THOUGHT

13:30.710 --> 13:32.844
THAT BY ADDING MORE POISON
TO HER DIET,

13:32.846 --> 13:34.579
IT WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWED UP
AT THE AUTOPSY.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.282
I'VE CONTACTED
MARCELLA'S PERSONAL PHYSICIAN,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.617
A DR. ENRIQUE CABRERA.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.887
NOW, IN THE ABSENCE OF A BODY,
DR. CABRERA MAY HAVE

13:42.889 --> 13:45.323
A LEFTOVER BLOOD SAMPLE
PROVING OUR VICTIM WAS POISONED.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.825
DR. CABRERA, HUH?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.194
YEAH, WELL, HE SIGNED
THE OLD LADY'S DEATH CERTIFICATE

13:49.196 --> 13:51.596
AT 8:12 P.M.
ON MAY 11th,

13:51.598 --> 13:54.098
BUT THE POLICE
DIDN'T GET THERE UNTIL 9:35,

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
AFTER THE BODY
HAD ALREADY BEEN REMOVED.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.102
OH, W-WAIT,
THAT'S NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.305
THE BODY WAS REMOVED
BEFORE OUR GUYS GOT THERE?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.806
WHO THE HELL DID THAT?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.509
IT JUST SAYS
"RELEASED TO FUNERAL HOME,"

14:04.511 --> 14:07.212
WHERE SHE WAS
CONVENIENTLY INCINERATED.

14:07.214 --> 14:11.282
OUR PERSONAL PHYSICIAN
HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.119
HOW DOES ONE
E-EXPLAIN DEATH?

14:15.121 --> 14:17.922
USUALLY WITH AN AUTOPSY,

14:17.924 --> 14:19.924
WHICH WE'RE UNABLE TO DO
IN THIS CASE.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.026
HOW LONG WAS MARCELLA
UNDER YOUR CARE?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.696
THREE GLORIOUS YEARS.

14:24.698 --> 14:28.266
I MISS HER
LIKE I DO MY FIRST WIFE.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.638
DID YOU DISCUSS MARCELLA'S
LEUKEMIA TREATMENT WITH ANYONE?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.974
<i>I'M PREVENTED FROM THAT</i>
<i>BY FEDERAL STATUTE.</i>

14:35.976 --> 14:37.642
SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNEW

14:37.644 --> 14:40.345
ABOUT THE COMPOUNDS
IN HER CHEMOTHERAPY.
I DOUBT IT.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.714
MS. BREWSTER LIKED TO TALK
TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN

14:42.716 --> 14:44.782
ABOUT HER HEALTH --
AND ABOUT HER MONEY.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.785
HOW MANY TIMES DID I HAVE TO
ATTEST TO THE WOMAN'S SANITY

14:47.787 --> 14:49.954
BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO VIDEO A NEW WILL?

14:49.956 --> 14:53.992
EVERY OTHER DAY,
SHE CHANGED THE TERMS,

14:53.994 --> 14:56.094
EXCEPT FOR LEAVING

14:56.096 --> 14:57.795
<i>THAT DETESTABLE MALTESE,</i>
<i>FALCON,</i>

14:57.797 --> 15:00.331
<i>HER HOUSE</i>
<i>PLUS $20 MILLION.</i>

15:00.333 --> 15:03.468
I MEAN,
THE DOG IS...CUTE...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.536
BUT STILL.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.906
THE DOCTOR HAS
NO ARREST RECORD, MA'AM,

15:07.908 --> 15:10.108
BUT HE DEFINITELY KNEW
SHE WAS INGESTING ARSENIC.
Tao: <i>WHILE SHE WAS</i>
<i>UNDER YOUR CARE,</i>

15:10.110 --> 15:12.310
<i>DID YOU TAKE OR ORDER</i>
<i>ANY BLOOD TESTS?</i>
<i>OF COURSE.</i>

15:12.312 --> 15:14.312
MAYBE HE WAS NAMED
A BENEFICIARY

15:14.314 --> 15:15.980
OF ONE OF MARCELLA'S
VIDEO WILLS.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.284
WELL, THEY SHOULD ALL BE A
MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD BY NOW.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.352
I'LL GO LOOK.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.889
I ASSURE YOU MS. BREWSTER
DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES,

15:24.891 --> 15:26.724
DESPITE
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

15:26.726 --> 15:29.627
WHO WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO STRANGLE HER IN HER SLEEP.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.264
TOWARD THE END, DID YOU NOTICE
AN ABRUPT DECLINE?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.100
WELL, AS DECLINES GO,
DEATH IS FAIRLY EXTREME.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.971
YES, BUT, SADLY, DURING HER LAST
FEW DAYS HERE ON EARTH,

15:39.973 --> 15:44.842
MARCELLA REFUSED MY CARE
AND HAD HER SECURITY GUARD,

15:44.844 --> 15:48.379
CAPTAIN BAIRD,
ESCORT ME OFF THE PROPERTY.

15:48.381 --> 15:52.150
ONLY WHEN SHE WAS PASSING
FROM THIS WORLD TO THE NEXT
DID I RECEIVE A CALL.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.853
I RUSHED TO HER SIDE, NATURALLY,
BUT BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,

15:55.855 --> 15:59.023
ALL I COULD DO
WAS WHISPER A SAD...

15:59.025 --> 16:05.396
"ADIOS, ANCIANA...
ADIOS."

16:05.398 --> 16:08.199
OH, AND SIGN
THE DEATH CERTIFICATE.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.735
CAN YOU EXPLAIN
WHY YOU RELEASED THE BODY

16:10.737 --> 16:12.503
FOR REMOVAL
BEFORE THE POLICE ARRIVED?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.871
THAT WAS NOT ME.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.574
AFTER I PERFORMED
MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES,

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
THEY IMMEDIATELY
REMOVED HER BODY.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.346
THEY REMOVED THE BODY?
WHO ARE "THEY"?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.881
<i>WELL, THE SAME PEOPLE</i>
<i>WHO HAD TAKEN OVER HER LIFE</i>

16:23.883 --> 16:26.951
<i>AND HIRED THAT LOATHSOME</i>
<i>CAPTAIN BAIRD.</i>

16:26.953 --> 16:30.621
<i>THEY CALLED THEMSELVES</i>
<i>ETERNAL MEADOWS.</i>

16:30.623 --> 16:32.790
ETERNAL MEADOWS?
E.M.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.060
THAT'S THE CORPORATION
SHE LEFT MOST OF HER MONEY.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.929
YES. THEY SOUND LIKE A CULT,
DON'T THEY?

16:37.931 --> 16:40.098
YOU SEE, I THOUGHT PERHAPS,
AS SHE REACHED THE END,

16:40.100 --> 16:47.338
MARCELLA DECIDED TO FIND GOD
BEFORE GOD COULD FIND HER.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.508
THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.212
Woman:
<i>LIFE IN ALL ITS WONDER SEEMS</i>
<i>FULL OF ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES.</i>

16:54.214 --> 16:57.448
<i>BUT WHAT IF</i>
<i>IT WERE TRULY ENDLESS?</i>

16:57.450 --> 17:01.319
<i>ETERNAL MEADOWS OFFERS,</i>
<i>THROUGH ADVANCED CRYONICS,</i>

17:01.321 --> 17:05.123
<i>THE CHANCE OF MAKING INFINITE</i>
<i>LIFE EXTENSION A REALITY.</i>

17:05.125 --> 17:07.291
<i>OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART</i>
<i>FREEZING CHAMBERS</i>

17:07.293 --> 17:13.064
<i>ARE SECURED AROUND THE CLOCK,</i>
<i>ASSURING YOUR ENDURING FUTURE.</i>

17:13.066 --> 17:14.932
JONATHAN,
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.934
IF MARCELLA BREWSTER
WAS CREMATED,

17:16.936 --> 17:18.469
SHE WAS REMOVED
FROM HER HOME

17:18.471 --> 17:21.806
BY A COMPANY
THAT FREEZES BODIES?

17:21.808 --> 17:25.276
ETERNAL MEADOWS
DOESN'T FREEZE BODIES.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.677
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.012
AND I HAVE SAID
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.214
UH, IF I MAY, CAPTAIN.
LISTEN, DICK.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.818
IN ORDER TO PROVE THE POISONING,
WE HAVE TO HAVE A TISSUE SAMPLE.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.953
YEAH, AND THE BODY WAS CREMATED.
I GET IT.

17:35.955 --> 17:41.225
BUT IF YOU PEOPLE COULD
JUST THINK IT THROUGH, HUH?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.693
HMM?

17:42.695 --> 17:46.564
ETERNAL MEADOWS
FREEZES PEOPLE'S HEADS?!

17:46.566 --> 17:47.965
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
DO THEY?

17:47.967 --> 17:50.835
OKAY. WHY WOULD SHE NOT PRESERVE
HER ENTIRE SELF?

17:50.837 --> 17:53.171
BECAUSE WITH STEM-CELL ADVANCES,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR HEAD

17:53.173 --> 17:55.339
ATTACHED TO A YOUNGER BODY
WHEN THEY THAW YOU OUT.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.009
Provenza: WELL, YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT LOGIC.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.777
HOW ON EARTH
COULD YOU WORK

17:59.779 --> 18:01.979
FOR A COMPANY
LIKE ETERNAL MEADOWS?

18:01.981 --> 18:03.848
WELL, HOW ABOUT, THEY WERE
THE ONLY PEOPLE ON EARTH

18:03.850 --> 18:05.416
WHO WOULD HIRE ME?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.951
WELL, HERE'S ANOTHER THING
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.820
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA
PROVE POISONING,

18:08.822 --> 18:10.321
I NEED TO GET
A SEARCH WARRANT

18:10.323 --> 18:13.491
FOR MARCELLA BREWSTER'S
FROZEN HEAD.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.792
YEAH, WELL,
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.294
