02:41.138 --> 02:42.639
Who are you?

02:42.722 --> 02:45.267
And what are you doing
in Jessica's apartment

02:45.350 --> 02:46.643
with all the lights off?

02:47.269 --> 02:50.022
The lights are off
to suggest no one is here.

02:50.105 --> 02:51.440
But you couldn't take a hint.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.150
Because someone is here.

02:54.068 --> 02:55.945
But not Jessica?

02:57.154 --> 02:58.655
Tell me, who are you?

03:00.407 --> 03:02.701
My name is Ruben.
I'm her neighbor.

03:02.784 --> 03:05.245
- I made her banana bread.
- Why?

03:05.996 --> 03:07.539
Because I love her.

03:14.296 --> 03:16.882
- Get off me!
- You're cut off!

03:18.300 --> 03:20.469
I was just leaving.

03:20.552 --> 03:23.013
You didn't kick me out, I left.

03:27.935 --> 03:29.353
You stink.

03:31.688 --> 03:34.066
Well, I'm a piece of shit,
and shit stinks.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.402
Got a dollar?

03:44.618 --> 03:47.704
Blimpie's punch card.
Two away from a free sub.

04:04.096 --> 04:05.514
About time.

05:02.071 --> 05:03.280
Hey, Wendy.

05:06.241 --> 05:08.285
Jessica...

05:08.368 --> 05:11.455
- Have you been following me?
- I'm usually stealthier.

05:11.538 --> 05:13.540
You're gonna sign these divorce papers.

05:13.623 --> 05:15.334
I am not gonna sign anything

05:15.417 --> 05:17.669
on the subway platform
in the middle of the night.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.172
Have Jeri call my lawyer.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.674
Ow! Ow!

05:22.757 --> 05:24.676
Ah! Jesus!

05:25.385 --> 05:29.139
- You are going to sign these papers or...
- Or what?

05:29.223 --> 05:31.225
I'm not afraid of you.

05:31.308 --> 05:33.477
Do you know what shame feels like, Wendy?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.686
Of course.

05:34.769 --> 05:38.357
No, I mean real shame, Wendy.

05:39.899 --> 05:42.027
You know,
when you've done something...

05:42.111 --> 05:46.531
You've hurt,
disgusted someone so completely...

05:46.615 --> 05:47.992
that you can see it in their eyes.

05:51.203 --> 05:55.332
The black, oozing shit inside you.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.753
You sweat it through your skin
but it keeps spreading...

06:00.670 --> 06:04.633
until you would do anything...
not to feel it.

06:06.468 --> 06:09.013
- Anything.
- You're crazy.

06:09.929 --> 06:12.516
Sign the papers or I'll drop...

06:14.309 --> 06:16.896
Shit!

06:16.978 --> 06:18.730
I didn't mean to do that.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.532
Well, how long have you been here?

07:11.825 --> 07:13.660
Jazzercise?

07:20.834 --> 07:23.128
Running actually helps with sobriety.

07:23.212 --> 07:24.546
Sobriety blows.

07:24.629 --> 07:26.965
You're a real inspiration.

07:35.057 --> 07:36.308
Oh, careful.

07:40.562 --> 07:42.189
What you need...

07:42.272 --> 07:44.858
is some electrolytes,
something solid in your stomach.

07:51.030 --> 07:52.157
Hmm.

08:40.914 --> 08:42.874
Jesus Christ!

08:42.957 --> 08:45.919
Holy Jesus Christ!

08:46.002 --> 08:49.464
He's dead. That's...
That's his dead body. That's Ruben.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.639
Kilgrave.

08:59.516 --> 09:01.059
He was here.

09:02.269 --> 09:03.978
He made Ruben...

09:06.773 --> 09:08.525
Oh, my God,
poor Ruben.

09:09.568 --> 09:12.946
Oh, man, his poor sister.
I just...

09:13.029 --> 09:14.906
I can't. I can't do this.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.451
I can't. I can't keep fighting him.

09:17.534 --> 09:19.036
- I can't fight him!
- Hey, hey.

09:19.118 --> 09:20.453
I can't do this!

09:20.537 --> 09:22.372
Hey, look at me.

09:22.456 --> 09:25.542
You have not killed anyone, all right?

09:27.336 --> 09:29.128
Right? Just breathe.

09:31.381 --> 09:32.632
This has to stop.

09:34.468 --> 09:35.885
Yeah, you're right.

09:35.969 --> 09:37.679
You know what?
We're gonna make it stop.

09:37.762 --> 09:41.308
I'm gonna call the police right now
and we're gonna make it stop.

09:41.391 --> 09:43.727
They'll arrest me.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.770
You didn't do it
and the evidence will confirm that.

09:45.854 --> 09:49.524
This is the third death
that I'm directly connected to.

09:58.533 --> 10:00.660
I'm so sorry, Ruben.

10:10.462 --> 10:12.088
I'm gonna end it.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.384
End what?

10:17.886 --> 10:19.053
Yourself?

10:21.097 --> 10:22.891
There's another option.

10:26.185 --> 10:28.021
I go to jail.

10:28.104 --> 10:29.314
What? No!

10:30.023 --> 10:32.484
But it has to be the right jail.

10:40.992 --> 10:43.327
Why the hell would you
wanna be locked up there?

10:43.412 --> 10:46.706
Because supermax prison
is a hi-tech mousetrap,

10:46.790 --> 10:48.917
and I'll be the bait
when Kilgrave comes for me.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.044
- If he comes for you.
- He'll come!

10:51.670 --> 10:52.796
I know him.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.506
Or he will just send somebody.

10:54.589 --> 10:57.216
He can't compel someone
through seven layers of security.

10:57.301 --> 10:59.386
He'll have to come himself,
use his powers,

10:59.469 --> 11:01.888
which will be recorded on security cameras
that he can't erase.

11:01.971 --> 11:05.850
Or you spend the rest of your life
locked up with a bunch of murderers.

11:06.643 --> 11:08.853
I need proof, Malcolm.

11:08.937 --> 11:10.272
And this could expose him.

11:11.648 --> 11:14.233
- Unbelievable.
- And there's a detective...

11:14.818 --> 11:15.985
What is his name?

11:16.069 --> 11:18.154
He questioned me
about the Shlottman murders.

11:18.237 --> 11:20.073
He's already suspicious.

11:23.577 --> 11:24.578
<i>15th Precinct.</i>

11:24.661 --> 11:25.912
Homicide, please.

11:25.995 --> 11:27.288
- No. Stop!
<i>- Homicide.</i>

11:27.372 --> 11:30.208
Hi, can I speak to the lead detective
on the Shlottman murders?

11:30.291 --> 11:31.835
<i>- Uh, Clemons?</i>
- Clemons, right.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.127
Can I speak with him?

11:33.211 --> 11:35.129
<i>- Can I help you?</i>
- No, it has to be him.

11:35.213 --> 11:37.298
What time is he on duty?

11:37.382 --> 11:39.509
<i>- 8:00 p.m.</i>
- 8:00 p.m. I'll be there.

11:40.969 --> 11:43.972
Okay. 8:00 p.m.
This is good, right?

11:44.055 --> 11:47.266
It gives us time to think, you know,
about what's the potential fall-out?

11:47.351 --> 11:49.561
- Who else is vulnerable?
- I need a lawyer.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.187
Okay, good.

11:52.897 --> 11:54.691
I'm gonna stay here with Ruben.

11:54.774 --> 11:56.610
No, you have to disappear.

11:56.693 --> 11:59.654
- Look, I'm in this now, Jessica.
- No, I don't want you in this!

11:59.738 --> 12:02.031
And I don't want you in this either.

12:02.115 --> 12:03.867
I can't protect you anymore.

12:04.868 --> 12:06.995
If you don't believe me,
ask Ruben.

12:09.706 --> 12:12.291
I only have until 8:00 p.m.
to tie up loose ends.

12:33.062 --> 12:34.522
No!

13:06.846 --> 13:09.390
That was, uh, intense.

13:10.391 --> 13:11.476
Don't talk.

13:14.062 --> 13:15.980
Whatever you say, boss.

13:23.655 --> 13:25.990
You know, you answer it,
they'll stop calling.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.453
- No, she won't.
- "She"?

13:29.536 --> 13:32.121
- It's Jessica.
- What, you're dodging her calls?

13:32.205 --> 13:34.373
She'll just...

13:34.458 --> 13:36.918
try and convince me
that it wasn't my fault.

13:38.002 --> 13:40.505
The van, losing Kilgrave.

13:40.589 --> 13:44.050
Ah. Well, she's right.
That's on her.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.844
Don't say that.

13:50.181 --> 13:51.307
Doesn't matter.

13:52.476 --> 13:56.646
I am not calling her
until I have something to tell her.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.814
About?

13:57.897 --> 14:00.609
I'm, uh... I'm starving.
Udon noodle salad?

14:00.692 --> 14:04.613
Oh, wow!
You just blew past that question.

14:04.696 --> 14:06.740
What's going on, Trish?

14:09.868 --> 14:12.036
Trish, what are you up to?

14:13.121 --> 14:14.664
I'd rather not say.

14:14.748 --> 14:17.416
- Well, if it involves Kilgrave...
- Well, not yet.

14:17.501 --> 14:19.919
Oh, shit. It does?

14:20.003 --> 14:22.839
Calm down.
I'm not gonna go anywhere near him.

14:22.922 --> 14:25.509
Which implies that you know where he is.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.051
I don't.

14:31.055 --> 14:32.557
I might have a lead.

14:33.975 --> 14:35.894
So, you gonna tell me?

14:52.494 --> 14:53.953
{an8}Mmm, military.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.163
Ex.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.165
They're bodyguards.

14:57.916 --> 15:00.126
{an8}Kilgrave's new bodyguards.

15:00.209 --> 15:02.003
And how do you know?

15:03.129 --> 15:05.173
I went to all the top
New York security firms,

15:05.256 --> 15:08.802
told them...
an old stalker of mine was back...

15:08.885 --> 15:12.180
that I was in the market
for a new protection detail.

15:12.263 --> 15:15.517
After that, it was just a matter of
getting the right people to talk.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.976
No way.

15:17.060 --> 15:20.814
The first rule of personal security
is to keep your clients secret.

15:21.815 --> 15:24.776
- I give good talk.
- Oh, clearly.

15:26.485 --> 15:29.781
So, we follow these guys,
maybe they lead us to Kilgrave.

15:29.864 --> 15:31.032
We stake him out.

15:31.115 --> 15:34.619
Call in Jess, she tosses him in
that hermetically sealed room you set up.

15:34.703 --> 15:36.663
Oh, Trish...

15:36.746 --> 15:39.290
some people need to be
removed from this Earth,

15:39.373 --> 15:40.499
and Kilgrave is one of 'em.

15:40.584 --> 15:43.044
We don't get to decide that.

15:43.127 --> 15:45.755
Killers decide that.
That's what makes them killers.

15:45.839 --> 15:47.256
That is naive...

15:47.340 --> 15:50.259
And idealistic, and futile,
but I want justice for my friend.

15:50.343 --> 15:53.179
For that girl in prison.
For you and me.

15:53.262 --> 15:55.932
I want Kilgrave to live long
and alone and despised

15:56.015 --> 15:58.476
until he wants to die,
but can't.

15:59.352 --> 16:01.938
Because that's justice,
and I'll fight like hell for it.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.565
Wow.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.275
You just need a flag and a horse.

16:06.359 --> 16:08.612
- I'd look goddamn good on it.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.537
I need you to be ready
with every exhibit.

16:17.621 --> 16:19.581
- I know.
- It will be rapid fire.

16:19.664 --> 16:22.000
Any pauses will kill my rhythm.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.960
I am organized
and caffeinated to the hilt.

16:24.043 --> 16:25.419
- I need a lawyer.
- You scared me.

16:25.503 --> 16:27.714
- How did you know we were here?
- The temp.

16:27.797 --> 16:29.465
- Fire the temp.
- I need a lawyer.

16:29.548 --> 16:30.842
I'm about to try a case.

16:30.925 --> 16:33.511
Yes, Jessica,
I have cases other than Hope's.

16:33.595 --> 16:35.346
This one is precedent-setting.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.266
Defending some guilty,
rich asshole for fraud?

16:38.349 --> 16:40.685
It's not Jeri's job to determine
guilt or innocence.

16:40.769 --> 16:42.646
Jessica, I don't have time
for distractions right now.

16:42.729 --> 16:44.105
Then you'll be happy to know

16:44.188 --> 16:46.608
that I served your ex
the divorce papers last night.

16:47.483 --> 16:48.484
Did Wendy sign?

16:49.485 --> 16:50.569
She'll sign.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.156
- Did she say that?
- She'll sign.

16:52.238 --> 16:53.239
When?

16:55.659 --> 16:58.119
I need... a lawyer.

17:01.956 --> 17:04.667
Pam, could you go inside
and set up, please?

17:04.751 --> 17:06.877
- I'll be right there.
- Yeah.

17:14.803 --> 17:17.180
Did you do something to Wendy?

17:17.262 --> 17:19.848
Yeah, I scared the shit out of her,
per your request.

17:19.933 --> 17:22.101
I just want this done.

17:22.185 --> 17:23.602
Yeah, I know the feeling.

17:25.063 --> 17:29.483
Now... what do I have to do to get
locked up in supermax by nightfall?

17:29.567 --> 17:31.903
Are you telling me that you're planning
to commit a crime?

17:31.986 --> 17:33.905
Because I would be
obligated to report that.

17:33.988 --> 17:35.782
What would it take?

17:36.825 --> 17:39.953
All right.
Supermax only houses the worst criminals.

17:41.162 --> 17:43.164
Top-shelf perverts, cannibals,

17:43.247 --> 17:47.626
serial killers who make mosaics
with their victims' fingernails.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.840
Well, that's... very specific.

17:51.923 --> 17:54.843
It's a living hell... with real demons.

17:54.926 --> 17:57.303
It is the last place you wanna end up.

18:00.807 --> 18:02.976
Be at the 15th Precinct at 8:00 p.m.

18:03.059 --> 18:05.561
I'm a defense lawyer.
I keep people out of jail.

18:05.644 --> 18:06.730
Not today.

18:06.813 --> 18:08.231
What're you gonna do?

18:08.314 --> 18:09.774
It's already done.

18:29.919 --> 18:32.046
I can't believe I'm doing this.

18:41.973 --> 18:43.892
Hey, that's not your apartment!

18:45.852 --> 18:48.021
Uh, yeah,
I was borrowing a, um...

18:49.480 --> 18:50.481
toothpaste.

18:51.274 --> 18:53.234
Can't lie to me, string bean.

18:53.317 --> 18:56.070
I got a bullshit meter
the size of West Texas.

18:57.030 --> 19:00.867
You weren't getting a toothpaste,
were you?

19:02.827 --> 19:04.120
Tell the truth.

19:05.329 --> 19:06.372
No.

19:06.455 --> 19:09.667
I wasn't getting... toothpaste.

19:12.837 --> 19:14.422
I was looking for booze.

19:14.505 --> 19:17.550
Human lie detector, right here!

19:17.633 --> 19:19.385
I can always tell.

19:21.304 --> 19:22.471
Right, well, I, uh...

19:22.555 --> 19:23.639
I didn't take any.

19:23.722 --> 19:27.185
Addicts, man!
You are so sneaky.

19:28.311 --> 19:30.021
Let me smell your breath.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.113
Glad the demons
didn't get the better of you, Q-Tip.

19:41.449 --> 19:44.618
You know, I think Jones
is hiding something about my brother.

19:45.661 --> 19:47.371
No, I don't think so.

19:47.455 --> 19:50.249
He's been drawing their initials
with a big heart around 'em

19:50.333 --> 19:52.001
on his Etch-a-Sketch.

19:52.085 --> 19:53.586
Something's going on.

19:55.046 --> 19:56.255
It is.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.175
They're involved.

19:59.258 --> 20:02.636
She is a sexual predator!
He's just a boy!

20:03.429 --> 20:04.638
In his 20s.

20:06.765 --> 20:09.768
Thank you, Malcolm...
for telling me the truth.

20:11.145 --> 20:13.356
I just can't handle the lies.

20:17.944 --> 20:19.028
Robyn, wait.

20:20.154 --> 20:21.572
There's something else.

20:21.655 --> 20:22.991
Yeah?

20:23.782 --> 20:25.701
Jessica's not a bad person.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.912
You have to know that.

20:29.914 --> 20:32.917
I don't know what kind of spell
that harpy puts on men,

20:33.001 --> 20:35.586
but you have to stop doing her bidding.

20:36.838 --> 20:38.381
You're better than that.

20:39.298 --> 20:40.925
I can always tell.

21:05.158 --> 21:06.159
Hello?

21:13.374 --> 21:14.959
Looking for Luke?

21:16.585 --> 21:18.212
He took some time off.

21:19.213 --> 21:22.091
- Went away for a while.
- Good. Good for him.

21:25.303 --> 21:27.180
I just wanted to tell him...

21:28.681 --> 21:30.975
You just wanted to tell him you love him,

21:31.059 --> 21:33.561
you want him back,
you're gonna have his baby.

21:33.644 --> 21:35.104
What? No.

21:37.315 --> 21:38.607
Heard it before.

21:39.984 --> 21:42.861
Best move on.
He won't miss you.

21:42.946 --> 21:44.697
The only one he ever missed...

21:45.698 --> 21:47.283
is in the ground.

21:48.910 --> 21:50.244
Tell him...

21:52.371 --> 21:54.999
the right people are gonna pay
for what's been done.

21:58.461 --> 22:01.214
And tell him
I don't expect him to forgive me.

22:02.381 --> 22:05.134
You know what happens
when you burn a bridge?

22:05.843 --> 22:09.347
You gotta learn to swim... or fly.

22:26.864 --> 22:28.616
For the love of God, Wendy.

22:28.699 --> 22:30.493
I wanted to hand-deliver this to you.

22:31.577 --> 22:32.661
The divorce papers.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.085
You're so...

22:40.378 --> 22:42.005
beautiful.

22:42.088 --> 22:43.381
And naive.

22:44.298 --> 22:46.634
- You probably don't deserve this.
- Deserve what?

22:46.717 --> 22:47.926
What is this?

22:48.969 --> 22:52.306
Printouts of our old
e-mail correspondence.

22:52.390 --> 22:54.100
Still have that AOL account.

22:54.183 --> 22:55.809
Subject line "Seven,"

22:55.893 --> 22:58.479
meaning juror number seven
in Jeri's first capital case.

22:58.562 --> 23:02.066
I'm guessing she didn't tell you
about bribing him.

23:02.150 --> 23:03.692
You're blackmailing me?

23:03.776 --> 23:05.694
You threaten my life,

23:05.778 --> 23:06.862
I threaten your career.

23:06.945 --> 23:09.448
Which is more important to her
than her life...

23:09.532 --> 23:10.949
or anyone else's.

23:11.034 --> 23:13.202
I did not threaten you.

23:13.286 --> 23:15.038
You sent your freakish thug.

23:15.121 --> 23:17.040
You made me afraid.
It was sickening.

23:17.123 --> 23:20.293
So, I am protecting myself.

23:20.376 --> 23:23.046
Get out...
or I will call security.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.964
And I'll call
the New York Bar Association.

23:26.799 --> 23:29.593
Fair warning, she lies.

23:29.677 --> 23:31.637
It's second nature to her.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.264
Jeri never lied to me.

23:33.347 --> 23:35.599
She told me about this
when we first got together.

23:38.769 --> 23:42.065
75% of your assets,
or you'll lose it all.

23:47.195 --> 23:48.404
Thank you.

23:49.405 --> 23:53.367
It's difficult to defend you when
she knows more of your secrets than I do.

24:06.339 --> 24:07.506
Thank you.

24:08.466 --> 24:09.467
Let's go.

24:15.223 --> 24:17.058
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:17.141 --> 24:19.352
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:19.435 --> 24:21.854
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:21.937 --> 24:23.939
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:24.022 --> 24:25.983
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:26.066 --> 24:28.276
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

24:32.573 --> 24:34.658
Stop fidgeting.

24:34.742 --> 24:37.536
I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great!

24:37.620 --> 24:39.330
Britney Kovak.

24:45.128 --> 24:46.337
Jessie.

24:48.589 --> 24:49.590
Come in.

24:51.717 --> 24:53.677
Our appointment was 30 minutes ago!

24:53.761 --> 24:55.888
Welcome to showbiz.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.811
You look terrific, Jessie.

25:02.895 --> 25:04.355
You look done.

25:04.438 --> 25:06.899
How much of Trish's money
did that cost you?

25:08.108 --> 25:10.778
Old age, honey.
Start saving now.

25:11.529 --> 25:14.323
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

25:14.407 --> 25:15.533
It's about Trish.

25:15.616 --> 25:17.075
Why? What's happened?

25:18.161 --> 25:20.371
- Is she on drugs again?
- She hasn't touched drugs

25:20.454 --> 25:22.581
since I dragged her away from you.

25:22.665 --> 25:25.709
I had no idea
that doctor was over-prescribing.

25:25.793 --> 25:29.797
Still no responsibility or remorse.

25:31.424 --> 25:32.925
I wish I could be like that.

25:33.008 --> 25:35.761
"No responsibility."
Hmm.

25:36.762 --> 25:38.806
I took you in.

25:38.889 --> 25:40.391
You were an orphan.

25:40.474 --> 25:41.892
That's gotta count for something.

25:41.975 --> 25:46.314
You don't get credit for doing
the right thing for the wrong reasons.

25:46.397 --> 25:47.856
I cared about...

25:47.940 --> 25:49.567
About publicity.

25:49.650 --> 25:55.030
I was a strategic play
to further the Patsy Walker brand.

25:56.114 --> 25:58.451
Trish is fine.

25:58.534 --> 26:00.077
She has security like Fort Knox

26:00.160 --> 26:03.163
and she's savvy enough not to let anyone
sneak up on her, except you.

26:03.247 --> 26:05.333
She has no defenses against you.

26:05.416 --> 26:08.085
She doesn't need defenses.

26:08.168 --> 26:09.169
I'm her mother.

26:09.253 --> 26:10.796
You're her pimp!

26:15.050 --> 26:17.220
I haven't seen her in three years.

26:17.303 --> 26:19.847
Except for when
you accidentally ran into her?

26:19.930 --> 26:21.349
It's a small city.

26:21.432 --> 26:23.726
And leave long,
drunken messages for her?

26:23.809 --> 26:26.479
What is it you want from me?

26:26.562 --> 26:28.856
I want you to stick to the agreement.

26:28.939 --> 26:31.775
Because no matter where I am...

26:31.859 --> 26:34.653
even if I'm behind bars...

26:34.737 --> 26:37.531
if you try... anything,

26:37.615 --> 26:39.575
I will find out...

26:39.658 --> 26:41.452
I will come for you...

26:41.535 --> 26:43.203
and it will hurt.

26:43.287 --> 26:44.997
People can change, Jessie.

26:45.623 --> 26:48.125
It doesn't make
the bad shit you did go away.

26:48.208 --> 26:50.085
I just...

26:51.295 --> 26:53.464
had a problem.

26:53.547 --> 26:54.632
I got help.

26:54.715 --> 26:56.174
And royalty checks.

26:58.427 --> 26:59.720
I earned those.

26:59.803 --> 27:02.765
If you want them to keep coming,
you'll respect Trish's wishes...

27:03.807 --> 27:05.309
which I will enforce.

27:06.269 --> 27:08.979
"And it will hurt."
You need a better tagline.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.524
Five hundred feet.
Just like a real restraining order.

27:12.358 --> 27:16.612
Five hundred feet away from her.
Do you understand?

27:16.695 --> 27:17.905
Yes.

27:19.782 --> 27:22.993
Taking you in
was the worst decision of my life.

27:23.911 --> 27:25.120
Thanks, Mom.

27:32.252 --> 27:34.337
<i>Trish, what's going on?</i>

27:34.422 --> 27:35.464
Any sign of Kilgrave?

27:35.548 --> 27:39.259
Not yet.
I'm still following his security detail.

27:39.343 --> 27:41.970
I've been tailing them all over the city,

27:42.054 --> 27:44.307
but it doesn't look like they're
up to too much.

27:44.390 --> 27:47.685
You sure these are Kilgrave's guys?

27:48.352 --> 27:50.020
You could have bad intel.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.648
<i>It's the only intel we have.
So we let it play out.</i>

27:52.731 --> 27:54.608
<i>Call me the second you get eyes on him.</i>

27:54.692 --> 27:56.109
Yes, ma'am.

28:02.950 --> 28:04.535
Where's Jessica?

28:04.618 --> 28:06.787
Thanks for coming.
Come in.

28:06.870 --> 28:09.748
My assistant thought you were a stalker.
You called ten times.

28:09.832 --> 28:11.459
You haven't told Jessica, right?

28:12.543 --> 28:15.087
You're shaking and sweating.
Are you high?

28:15.170 --> 28:19.342
Ugh, Trish, look, something has happened.
And now, Jessica is in trouble.

28:19.425 --> 28:20.676
What did she do?

28:20.759 --> 28:23.596
Nothing. That's the problem,
she hasn't done anything wrong.

28:23.679 --> 28:27.350
Look, she is about to make a huge mistake,

28:27.433 --> 28:28.976
and I am not gonna let her.

28:29.685 --> 28:30.811
Okay, let's hear it.

28:32.396 --> 28:34.232
Okay, I am...

28:34.314 --> 28:37.526
I'm gonna show you something
really, really bad.

28:38.777 --> 28:41.238
But you can't freak out.

28:41.322 --> 28:43.282
I'm not gonna freak out.

28:43.366 --> 28:44.825
Promise?

28:44.908 --> 28:46.369
Just show me.

28:52.249 --> 28:53.792
You cannot scream.

28:55.127 --> 28:56.294
I'm not gonna scream.

28:59.131 --> 29:00.758
Oh, my God!

29:00.841 --> 29:02.300
You said you wouldn't scream.

29:03.218 --> 29:04.470
- Hey. Hey.
- What did you do?

29:04.553 --> 29:07.180
Hey, whoa!
Now, just keep your voice down.

29:07.264 --> 29:08.807
What the hell happened?

29:08.891 --> 29:10.893
Kilgrave... all right?

29:10.976 --> 29:14.730
But what matters now is what's going
to happen at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

29:14.813 --> 29:16.189
I need...

29:17.525 --> 29:20.444
Jessica needs your help.

29:29.161 --> 29:31.246
- Pull over.
- I can't pull over.

29:31.329 --> 29:33.707
- Come on, man.
- You wanna get killed crossing here?

29:33.791 --> 29:37.002
I've got 56 minutes of freedom left.
I'll take my chances.

30:49.867 --> 30:51.702
<i>I hate goodbyes.</i>

30:52.828 --> 30:55.330
<i>I've always just disappeared.</i>

30:56.582 --> 30:58.584
<i>But this goodbye...</i>

30:59.960 --> 31:02.963
<i>this one deserves a last,
lingering look.</i>

31:18.687 --> 31:20.022
I've been calling you.

31:21.231 --> 31:23.859
I know. I was waiting
to tell you something, but...

31:23.942 --> 31:25.569
How did you get in?

31:25.653 --> 31:27.154
Malcolm. You gave him a key.

31:27.237 --> 31:28.446
Where is he?

31:29.364 --> 31:31.241
Saving you from yourself.

31:36.830 --> 31:38.957
What the hell did you do?

31:39.041 --> 31:41.794
You've lost it, Jess.
And I get it. I really do.

31:41.877 --> 31:43.461
But you're not thinking clearly.

31:43.546 --> 31:45.172
You don't know what you're talking about.

31:45.255 --> 31:48.008
I think I do, given the amount of blood
I just cleaned up.

31:48.091 --> 31:49.802
You wanna get yourself put away for it.

31:49.885 --> 31:52.095
I have a plan.

31:52.721 --> 31:56.141
You have guilt and shame
and it is clouding your judgment.

31:56.224 --> 31:58.185
A complex plan.

31:58.268 --> 31:59.645
A bad plan.

31:59.728 --> 32:03.899
Yes, it is a terrible plan
and it is a complete long shot.

32:03.982 --> 32:05.568
But it's the only plan I've got.

32:05.651 --> 32:07.736
You can't do anything in prison.

32:07.820 --> 32:11.031
You can't save Hope.
You can't protect anyone or yourself.

32:11.114 --> 32:12.825
Where the hell is the body?

32:15.368 --> 32:16.745
I know how to find Kilgrave.

32:18.413 --> 32:20.290
I have a lead.
I was waiting to tell you until...

32:20.373 --> 32:22.084
You are looking for him?

32:22.167 --> 32:24.837
Simpson is.
I found Kilgrave's new security team.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.090
No. You tell Simpson to back off.
He's gonna get himself killed.

32:28.173 --> 32:31.509
He'll call us in when he finds Kilgrave,
just let us handle it until...

32:31.594 --> 32:32.678
Until what?

32:32.761 --> 32:36.139
Until I come home and find my landlady
choked out in my bathtub?

32:36.223 --> 32:38.934
Or I find you bludgeoned to death
with my vacuum cleaner?

32:39.017 --> 32:40.978
We both know you don't own
a vacuum cleaner.

32:43.814 --> 32:46.149
I won't let you go to prison.
You're not a murderer.

32:48.777 --> 32:49.862
Yes, I am.

32:49.945 --> 32:53.031
You're still punishing yourself
for that woman's death?

32:53.115 --> 32:54.575
And now more people are dead.

32:54.658 --> 32:57.786
Hope Shlottman's parents,
Ruben, Reva,

32:57.870 --> 33:00.038
and someone has to give
their families closure.

33:00.122 --> 33:03.333
And until the real killer shows up,
that's gonna be me.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.918
I have to pay.

33:10.841 --> 33:13.761
There are so many ways
this could go wrong.

33:16.221 --> 33:18.223
There's one way it'll go right.

33:20.643 --> 33:22.770
No one else will die because of me.

33:23.937 --> 33:26.523
I'm taking myself out of the equation.

33:32.821 --> 33:35.741
I'm still not the hero
that you wanted me to be.

33:36.742 --> 33:38.827
You're exactly the hero
I wanted you to be.

33:41.579 --> 33:43.331
Tell me where Ruben is.

34:21.745 --> 34:23.121
A beautiful funeral...

34:23.621 --> 34:25.456
doesn't guarantee Heaven.

34:41.014 --> 34:43.183
Look at this, boss.

34:43.266 --> 34:45.393
Just like the picture.
Lucked out on eBay.

34:45.476 --> 34:47.228
Put it in the bedroom.
Nice work.

35:23.515 --> 35:24.807
Malcolm!

35:26.101 --> 35:28.395
- She told you.
- Where is he?

35:32.065 --> 35:34.860
Look, a coroner will see
that the wounds are self-inflicted.

35:34.943 --> 35:36.111
Hold this.

35:36.904 --> 35:38.405
I'll take care of it.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.661
You are done with this.

36:13.941 --> 36:16.819
- It was dark and...
- Yes.

36:16.902 --> 36:20.697
You'll have to wait.
Someone will be with you in a minute.

36:20.781 --> 36:22.365
Someone with yellow sneakers...

36:22.449 --> 36:23.783
Oh, sh...

36:25.160 --> 36:27.579
I've done something terrible.

36:32.459 --> 36:35.253
God damn it!
What is taking so long?

36:42.010 --> 36:44.137
I told you 8:00 p.m.
You're late.

36:44.221 --> 36:46.514
- You actually did it.
- Yes, I did.

36:46.598 --> 36:48.100
You have gone off the deep end.

36:48.183 --> 36:49.893
- I want her to have a psych eval.
- What?

36:49.977 --> 36:53.605
- We'll be pleading mental incompetence.
- I told you I need to go to supermax!

36:53.688 --> 36:56.108
I need to be in supermax.
I belong there.

36:56.191 --> 36:59.486
And I told you that I'm a defense attorney
who does not lose cases.

37:00.737 --> 37:02.655
Oh, so you're protecting your reputation?

37:02.739 --> 37:03.991
Wendy told me what you did.

37:04.074 --> 37:07.660
Excuse me, she screamed what you did.
Your judgment is severely impaired.

37:07.744 --> 37:09.037
I waive my right to counsel.

37:09.121 --> 37:11.539
No, she does not understand
what she's talking about.

37:11.623 --> 37:13.250
She doesn't understand her situation.

37:13.333 --> 37:17.587
I am fully cognizant of my situation.
This woman does not represent me.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.089
I can get you a public defender.

37:19.172 --> 37:20.340
I'll be representing myself in this.

37:20.423 --> 37:22.885
- We've already wasted enough time.
- For God's sake, let me do my job!

37:22.968 --> 37:25.470
It seems like you no longer
have a job, Miss Hogarth.

37:26.471 --> 37:27.555
You should leave.

37:32.477 --> 37:34.271
You still owe me a favor,
God damn it.

37:34.354 --> 37:36.273
Collect it from prison.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.327
Jesus Christ, Clemons.

37:49.411 --> 37:54.207
I brought you my victim's head,
and now I'm confessing.

37:54.291 --> 37:55.583
Open and shut.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.169
Is it?

37:57.835 --> 37:59.963
I'm sick...

38:00.047 --> 38:04.592
I'm dangerous and I belong in supermax.

38:05.510 --> 38:08.471
Supermax? Not jail?

38:09.764 --> 38:11.683
I'm a top-shelf pervert.

38:11.766 --> 38:15.938
Last time we talked, you were just
trying to make a goddamn living.

38:16.021 --> 38:19.149
Last time we talked,
you were suspicious of me.

38:19.232 --> 38:22.860
You thought that I was hiding something
and you were right.

38:22.945 --> 38:25.155
And now I'm tired of hiding.

38:25.238 --> 38:26.614
So you've come to me to...

38:26.698 --> 38:28.866
Expedite my incarceration.

38:28.951 --> 38:32.495
I just want... to rest.

38:36.541 --> 38:40.170
Clemons... you're two years away
from retiring.

38:40.253 --> 38:43.131
Call this an easy collar
and just put me away.

38:47.469 --> 38:49.721
Why'd you kill him?

38:49.804 --> 38:51.598
Because that's what I do.

38:53.183 --> 38:56.561
I'm a killer... and a sociopath.

38:56.644 --> 38:57.854
You never killed before?

38:57.938 --> 38:59.772
I've never been caught.

39:00.690 --> 39:01.899
Who else have you killed?

39:03.360 --> 39:05.612
A year ago I punched a woman
so hard in the chest

39:05.695 --> 39:07.739
that her heart stopped.

39:07.822 --> 39:09.032
Why?

39:09.950 --> 39:11.243
I didn't mean to.

39:11.326 --> 39:14.121
You beat a woman to death by accident?

39:15.330 --> 39:17.457
There is a power inside me...

39:18.708 --> 39:20.543
and it just takes over.

39:20.627 --> 39:26.174
Supermax is the only place
strong enough to hold me.

39:26.258 --> 39:27.842
That guy's head?

39:28.926 --> 39:31.096
I tore it off with my bare hands.

39:31.179 --> 39:33.890
That takes a lot of strength.

39:33.974 --> 39:35.350
And a hacksaw.

39:35.433 --> 39:36.851
Unbelievable.

39:38.353 --> 39:39.729
Miss Jones, sit down!

39:41.731 --> 39:43.816
You are wasting time!

39:47.279 --> 39:48.530
Oh!

39:48.613 --> 39:50.907
- Put me in supermax.
- Stop!

39:50.991 --> 39:53.785
Jessica Jones?
You're free to go.

39:53.868 --> 39:55.703
Mahoney, what are you doing?

39:57.247 --> 39:59.457
Captain's orders. Go, now.

40:01.959 --> 40:04.879
I told you Hogarth does not represent me.

40:04.962 --> 40:07.632
And I'm gonna kick her Armani-covered ass!

40:12.929 --> 40:15.432
Hogarth! I told you to...

40:45.128 --> 40:47.672
What the hell is going on here?

40:47.755 --> 40:49.299
Drop your weapons!

40:51.093 --> 40:52.427
Brett?

40:52.510 --> 40:54.887
Shut up. Don't move.

40:55.555 --> 40:58.600
Oh, everyone, calm down,
you're killing the mood.

41:03.980 --> 41:05.232
Jessica.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.945
You're not surprised to see me.
You had to know I'd come for you.

41:11.946 --> 41:13.198
Not this fast?

41:15.242 --> 41:18.911
I... I will admit to keeping eyes on you.

41:18.995 --> 41:21.581
Spies are easy to come by... for me.

41:23.750 --> 41:26.753
Do whatever you're going to do to me,
but let them go.

41:27.712 --> 41:30.047
Well, I have to protect myself, so...

41:31.716 --> 41:33.510
Then control me, not them.

41:34.511 --> 41:38.140
I have absolutely no intention
of controlling you.

41:38.223 --> 41:40.142
I want you to act on your own accord.

41:40.975 --> 41:42.977
Act how?

41:43.060 --> 41:44.271
Suicide?

41:45.438 --> 41:47.607
Is that why you've been torturing me?

41:47.690 --> 41:49.817
Oh, my God.

41:50.860 --> 41:54.156
Jessica, I knew you were insecure.
That's just sad.

41:55.865 --> 41:58.576
I'm not torturing you.
Why would I?

42:02.705 --> 42:04.166
I love you.

42:11.714 --> 42:13.216
You have been ruining...

42:14.551 --> 42:15.635
my life.

42:15.718 --> 42:17.094
You didn't have a life.

42:17.179 --> 42:20.932
As a demented declaration of love?

42:21.724 --> 42:23.435
No, obviously. I...

42:23.518 --> 42:25.937
I was trying...

42:26.020 --> 42:28.147
to show you what I see.

42:29.899 --> 42:32.360
That I'm the only one who matches you...

42:33.278 --> 42:34.612
who challenges you...

42:36.072 --> 42:37.865
who'll do anything for you.

42:40.535 --> 42:42.495
This is a sick joke.

42:43.538 --> 42:45.665
You have killed innocent people.

42:46.833 --> 42:50.545
Oh, well, that...
That milquetoast little man-boy?

42:50.628 --> 42:52.964
He interrupted me
while I was leaving you a present,

42:53.047 --> 42:54.716
which, apparently,
you didn't even find.

42:56.008 --> 42:58.845
Come on! You cannot pretend
he didn't irritate you, too.

42:58.928 --> 43:01.598
I wanted to slap him after 30 seconds.

43:04.141 --> 43:07.895
I know.
I realize this will take time.

43:10.898 --> 43:12.400
But I'm gonna prove it to you.

43:15.111 --> 43:16.654
Whose is that?

43:18.948 --> 43:21.075
Whose phone is that?

43:37.759 --> 43:40.762
Next person whose phone rings
has to eat it!

43:43.806 --> 43:47.727
Crappy fluorescent lights and cockroaches

43:47.810 --> 43:49.979
and loud cell phones
and the smell of piss!

43:50.062 --> 43:54.233
I am trying to profess
eternal love here, people!

43:54.317 --> 43:55.693
I'll come with you.

43:59.113 --> 44:00.907
To protect them.
Not out of choice.

44:00.990 --> 44:02.325
You know me well.

44:03.910 --> 44:05.662
We can work out the rest.

44:05.745 --> 44:07.204
Oh, please!

44:07.289 --> 44:09.123
I am new to love,
but I know what it looks like.

44:09.206 --> 44:10.250
I do watch television.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.504
You deranged prick.

44:14.587 --> 44:16.798
You've never loved anyone
in your repulsive life.

44:16.881 --> 44:18.966
Do not presume to know!

44:22.762 --> 44:25.097
Before I met you, I got...

44:26.391 --> 44:27.934
everything I wanted.

44:29.311 --> 44:30.895
And I didn't...

44:32.146 --> 44:33.481
realize...

44:35.567 --> 44:39.612
how unsatisfactory that was
until you left me to die.

44:43.491 --> 44:46.035
You are the first thing,
excuse me, person...

44:47.078 --> 44:49.789
I ever wanted that walked away from me.

44:52.709 --> 44:55.587
You made me feel something
I had never felt before.

44:57.755 --> 44:59.173
Yearning.

45:05.137 --> 45:06.931
I actually missed you.

45:10.518 --> 45:12.061
Well, I'm here now.

45:14.522 --> 45:15.607
You've got me.

45:16.441 --> 45:17.859
No, I don't.

45:21.446 --> 45:24.574
I'm hoping you'll choose me
just like I've chosen you.

45:26.993 --> 45:30.372
I believe you will figure out
the same thing I did.

45:31.706 --> 45:33.541
That we're inevitable.

45:39.338 --> 45:41.340
- Is it all gone?
- Almost done.

45:43.009 --> 45:45.553
I can't erase memories,
but I can erase security footage.

45:47.304 --> 45:50.933
All evidence that you and I were ever here
has been deleted.

45:56.355 --> 45:57.940
Manual decapitation. You...

45:59.233 --> 46:01.569
You're full of surprises.

46:04.697 --> 46:08.075
In 30 seconds, you'll all realize
this was a hilarious joke,

46:08.159 --> 46:10.870
and you'll let Jessica Jones leave.

46:15.291 --> 46:16.418
Look for my present.

46:17.168 --> 46:18.795
And when you are ready...

46:19.837 --> 46:21.964
I'll see you at home.

48:41.813 --> 48:44.231
You know where he is...
don't you?

48:46.609 --> 48:49.070
I can't help you.
You have to leave.

48:49.153 --> 48:51.155
Malcolm told me everything.

48:52.073 --> 48:53.282
What did he tell you?

48:53.365 --> 48:56.619
Oh, I'm sure Ruben is probably
just a distraction to you.

49:02.541 --> 49:05.211
You know he's just acting out against me.

49:09.215 --> 49:11.884
Tell him I'm sorry about the zoo.

49:11.968 --> 49:14.220
We can go this weekend.

49:14.303 --> 49:16.180
Will you tell him?

49:16.263 --> 49:19.601
I'll take him to see the giraffes.
I promise.

49:23.020 --> 49:25.565
He loves those long necks.

49:27.233 --> 49:30.194
He's very sensitive about his neck,
you know?

49:32.780 --> 49:34.657
You should know that.

49:35.366 --> 49:38.745
Also, he won't eat crust
if it has seeds on it.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.002
Ruben's not coming back.

49:47.544 --> 49:48.921
Where did he go?

49:50.339 --> 49:52.842
He can't take care of himself!

50:07.649 --> 50:09.191
This is all your fault.

50:09.275 --> 50:12.028
We were fine before you came here.

50:13.738 --> 50:17.033
No. Wait, don't go.

50:17.116 --> 50:19.076
Wait, you're a P.I., right?

50:19.160 --> 50:21.037
You can find him!

50:21.120 --> 50:23.622
I have money, please!

50:29.837 --> 50:31.547
Ruben!

51:11.087 --> 51:14.298
Jessica, I told you, we're not
wasting any more time looking for it.

51:14.381 --> 51:16.050
It's under one of the floorboards.

51:16.133 --> 51:19.595
- I just can't remember which one.
- Well, that wasn't very smart, was it?

51:19.678 --> 51:20.888
We'll buy you a new journal.

51:22.681 --> 51:23.975
Did you hear me?

51:25.142 --> 51:26.310
Yeah.

51:27.644 --> 51:30.147
I believe what you meant to say was,

51:30.231 --> 51:32.441
"Yes, thank you, Ms. Walker."

51:32.524 --> 51:36.237
You're gonna live with us now.
We use proper etiquette.

51:50.084 --> 51:52.211
Don't you know
it's rude to stare at people?
