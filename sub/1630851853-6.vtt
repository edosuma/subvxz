WEBVTT

00:03.236 --> 00:04.471
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:06.639 --> 00:08.908
You must remember
to buy "yerba mate".

00:20.887 --> 00:23.523
Did you see?
Chacarita won! Rafa!

00:35.668 --> 00:37.470
-Are you okay?
-How much is this?

00:38.838 --> 00:40.407
What are you doing?

00:41.674 --> 00:44.811
-Rafa?
-Let me go, you damn gook!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.115
-What's wrong?
-He can't drink alcohol.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.418
-He is in recovery.
-Don't let him drink then.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.754
-He is a big boy.
-He is your friend.

00:57.424 --> 01:01.628
-Don't let him drink.
-All right.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.844
-Give me the gun.
-What happened?

01:18.311 --> 01:19.612
Why do you want the gun for?

01:36.296 --> 01:37.564
Let him go!

01:48.308 --> 01:49.542
Let him go.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.962
Are you okay?

03:11.858 --> 03:15.361
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

03:21.734 --> 03:24.737
Sorry, I'm usually very busy
in the morning.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.906
What can I do for you?

03:28.107 --> 03:31.277
-Who is Juan García?
-I don't know.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.147
What do you have to do
with the boys...

03:34.214 --> 03:35.315
who compete on the tracks?

03:36.449 --> 03:39.052
-I don't understand.
-You don't?

03:39.786 --> 03:41.354
Don't play the fool.
You're a bastard.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.891
Your job is to protect us
not to kill us.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.994
Let's make it clear.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.698
I don't let anyone yell at me.
Let alone in my office.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.369
I'm very busy right now
so go away.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.905
Is everything all right?

04:18.825 --> 04:20.860
-What happened?
-Nothing.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.110
Hello?

04:39.512 --> 04:40.847
I don't understand.

04:43.516 --> 04:44.717
Who?

04:51.324 --> 04:52.325
Who is it?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.227
Julia.
You called me.

04:56.763 --> 05:00.867
Come in.
Thanks for coming.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.906
I didn't know who to call.
Follow me, please.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.009
Rafa remembered
you gave him your number.

05:10.610 --> 05:15.882
You're a reporter,
maybe you can help us.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.485
We don't know anybody
around here.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.026
What happened?

05:27.093 --> 05:28.461
Someone must go
to the boarding house.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.163
They can hurt Martina and Peque.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.364
Who did this to you?

05:31.898 --> 05:34.100
-Two guys. Never mind.
-Who were they?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.401
They were going to kill him.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.370
Rafael, my name is
Verónica Rosenthal.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.372
-I'm not Julia.
-Aren't you a reporter?

05:39.806 --> 05:41.441
Yes, but I work
for "Nuestro Tiempo" magazine.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.976
-Not at a local newspaper.
-I don't get it.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.378
It doesn't matter.
It is a long story.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.213
We need to take you to hospital.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.950
No, they can be waiting for me.
I don't want to be seen.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.819
-Why did they do this to you?
-Because I made the claim.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.888
Rivero'll realize
Peque told me about it.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.890
They'll go to the boarding house
looking for Martina.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.892
Rivero knows
she lives there too.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.561
Martina is his daughter.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.499
Give me the address.
I'll go to the boarding house.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.968
Tell me what claim
you made and where.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.871
I'll get someone to examine you.

06:11.938 --> 06:12.872
Who?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.988
How are you, Rivero?
García wants to see you.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.223
Let's go.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.559
Come on!

07:06.058 --> 07:08.094
-How are you, García?
-Who is Rafael Gómez?

07:10.229 --> 07:11.431
Who?

07:11.497 --> 07:12.999
Rafael Gómez made a claim
at the police station.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.035
He said he recruited
boys for you.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.437
Who the hell is he?

07:18.971 --> 07:20.540
The guy who runs
the club cafeteria.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.809
He finds me
strong and brave boys.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.812
For the soccer matches.
What claim did he make?

07:26.813 --> 07:28.314
He told everything
to the police.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.250
So he knows about it.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.654
If he knows, it is because...

07:37.156 --> 07:39.158
-I didn't open my mouth.
-So who was it?

07:43.496 --> 07:45.832
The boy who took part
in the last competition.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.000
You told me
everything was under control.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.838
Yes, it was.
I can't think of anybody else.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.708
You made a mess.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.544
Now you must clean it.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.916
-Where is Rafa?
-We don't know.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.754
He was about to be killed
but a Chinese man saved him.

08:10.756 --> 08:13.993
Julián is a friend of his.
I don't know him.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.162
Rafael speaks about him.
They go to see soccer together.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.431
He owns a food market in Lugano.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.035
Take care of the boy.
Did you hear me?

08:24.403 --> 08:25.805
We'll have another competition.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.408
I didn't want to do it
but gamblers insisted.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.680
-Do we have the competitors?
-One is for sure.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.717
One is not enough.
You must find another one.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.153
The sooner the better.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.820
I saw a sweater
just like the one you wanted.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.255
Brown with a round neck.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.158
Where are the kids?

09:19.492 --> 09:20.393
They went to town
with my sister.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.361
Are you okay?
What is going on?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.097
When are you coming back?

09:25.164 --> 09:26.332
Tomorrow.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.602
Can't you stay there
a couple of days longer?

09:29.669 --> 09:31.003
Why?

09:34.073 --> 09:35.474
Is it possible?

09:35.808 --> 09:37.009
What's wrong?

09:37.343 --> 09:38.644
Nothing.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.212
I know you.
There is something wrong.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.148
What is it?
Did something happen at work?

09:42.214 --> 09:45.318
No, it is just...

09:47.353 --> 09:48.921
that I am doing
some work at home.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.056
I want to give you a surprise.
I haven't finished yet.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.858
You're remodeling
the bathroom and the bedroom?

09:54.994 --> 09:57.263
If I tell you,
it won't be a surprise anymore.

09:59.131 --> 10:00.566
Can you stay a bit longer?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.868
How much longer?
Children can't miss school.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.839
Just two or three days.
I'll let you know.

10:07.306 --> 10:08.808
Fine. But not more than that.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.078
It's all very nice here
but I get bored.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.613
Besides, I miss you.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.881
I miss you too.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.517
Thank you.
I love you.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.519
Me too.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.446
Martina?
I'm a friend of your dad's.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.016
Yes, he phoned me.
Come in.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.086
The kids bought
a Playstation Three.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.922
And they gave my mother
the old model for me.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.258
-For us.
-Not it's mine.

11:00.292 --> 11:03.162
But you're going to play
with me, silly!

11:03.229 --> 11:04.730
I'm your only friend.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.804
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.907
Open the door, Peque.
It's me.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.609
That foolish girl!

11:27.153 --> 11:28.387
She is
with a very beautiful girl.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.725
-Are you Peque?
-No, he is.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.528
-Who is she?
-A friend of my father's.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.864
-May I come in?
-Yes. Slide the bolt.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.169
-Are you guys alone?
-Yes.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.906
I'm Verónica Rosenthal.
I'm a reporter.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.142
I know what's going on.
I know everything.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.304
What tracks?
I don't get it.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.673
The competition
is not about soccer.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.241
It's about staying
on the tracks...

12:22.308 --> 12:24.143
until the train comes.
Standing still there.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.747
Rivero must already know
you spoke with Rafael.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.215
And he may come to get you.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.150
-And you too.
-Why me?

12:31.617 --> 12:33.252
-Because of your dad.
-Who told him?

12:33.619 --> 12:34.720
That is not important now.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.523
I'll take you to a place
so that you can be safe.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.762
-Open up.
-Damn!

12:43.129 --> 12:44.330
I know you are in there.
The bolt is on.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.332
I'll open the door
and tell him he is not here.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.633
You're crazy.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.435
No, there must be
another way to leave the house.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.070
Don't open the door for him.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.905
He'll stay there forever.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.073
Come on!
Open the door.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.108
-I know what I'm doing.
-Okay.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.843
Where can we hide?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.345
I won't leave
until you open the door.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.483
Okay, I will stay here.

13:05.484 --> 13:06.819
We're friends.
Aren't we?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.998
What are you doing here?
Where is he?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.866
Who?

13:22.601 --> 13:25.070
Come on!
Peque, your friend.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.273
He went to visit
his grandmother.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.176
-Where does she live?
-I don't know.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.612
What are you doing here?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.381
I have the key to the house.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.982
They let me come
to play videogames.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.717
Why didn't you open the door?

13:39.051 --> 13:40.486
I was going to an upper level.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.191
Where is the girl?
Rafael's daughter.

13:45.591 --> 13:49.094
-I know she lives here too.
-I don't know.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.299
-Which is her house?
-That one over there.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.511
Listen to me.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.048
Would you like to compete?

14:09.381 --> 14:10.449
Of course.
When?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.585
Just answer yes or no.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.186
Yes, I do.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.456
-What did Peque tell you?
-About what?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.593
About the competition,
you silly!

14:21.227 --> 14:22.461
Nothing.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.697
Well, he told me
he competed for money.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.599
That's it.
Why?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.470
-Do you have a mobile phone?
-No.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.909
Here's some money.
Go buy one.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.144
A cheap one.
With a pre-paid card.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.684
You'll talk only to me.
Did you hear?

14:47.286 --> 14:50.122
As soon as you buy it,
you call me to this number.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.861
I'll let you know
when the competition is.

14:58.797 --> 14:59.999
This is between the two of us.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.300
All about the mobile phone
and the competition.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.068
You mustn't tell anyone.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.504
Don't spend the money
on stupid things.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.106
Buy the mobile phone right now.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.508
Do you want
to earn 1,000 pesos?

15:10.376 --> 15:13.979
Listen to me
and you'll be a millionaire.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.286
Let me know if you see Peque.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.488
But don't tell him
I'm looking for him.

15:22.554 --> 15:26.358
-What do you want from him?
-Nothing. No big deal.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.694
Buy the mobile phone.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.411
He is gone.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.022
I told you he wouldn't leave
so easily.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.591
The fat guy believed
everything I told him.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.429
-Who is in your home?
-No one.

16:03.495 --> 16:04.596
My mother gets home
in the evening.

16:04.663 --> 16:05.998
And my grandmother is out.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.166
What do we do now?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.768
You'll come to my place.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.504
Rivero thinks
I am at my grandmother's.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.875
-I'll be safe here.
-I can also stay here.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.978
Rivero knows you are going
to compete.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.647
He'll come for you.
You can't stay here.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.148
I'll buy the mobile phone
and call him up.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.917
He said he'd phone me.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.620
Fine.
Buy the mobile phone.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.156
And call me
as soon as he phones you.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.524
All right.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.095
-Take this.
-What is this for?

16:36.562 --> 16:38.397
Don't screw up.
Do as I tell you.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.400
Don't take part
in that damn competition.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.701
Did you hear me?

16:42.768 --> 16:45.304
How will you catch him?
Will you put him in jail?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
I'd love to.
But I don't know.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.143
I should compete.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.380
You could take the police there
and catch them red-handed.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.083
-What do you think?
-That is very dangerous.

16:58.984 --> 16:59.952
What he did was dangerous.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.954
He stayed there
until the very last minute.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.891
When I see the train coming,
I'll jump off.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.793
He's right.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.563
They'll both jump off
and nobody will get hurt.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.365
Several kids have died
doing that.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.769
You may think I'm afraid
but I'm not.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.506
Besides, I want
to be on the papers.

17:20.572 --> 17:23.575
-Like a hero.
-You're already a hero.

17:25.177 --> 17:29.048
-Me too.
-Yes, you too.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.950
You were there.
What do you think?

17:33.185 --> 17:36.422
If he jumps off quickly,
he'll be fine.

17:43.996 --> 17:47.032
Valrossa came to the office
and yelled at me.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.803
He said your name.
He asked about Juan García.

17:51.136 --> 17:55.707
Fine, I'll talk to you later.
Rivero called to say...

17:55.774 --> 17:56.942
he's got the two boys
for the competition.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.945
Fine. Did he take care
of the boy who spoke too much?

18:00.012 --> 18:01.380
He doesn't know where he is.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.714
They told him he went
to his grandmother's.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.849
But he doesn't know
where she lives.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.652
Valrossa knows more
than we thought.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.555
If he knows,
the reporter does too.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.759
We'll lie low for a while.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.596
There is something else.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.500
When the whole thing finishes,
I want Aguirre...

18:21.567 --> 18:23.735
to get the two boys on a car,
take them to the river...

18:23.802 --> 18:25.237
and shoot both of them.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.340
I don't want any loose ends.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.043
But they are ten years old!

18:33.312 --> 18:34.346
So what?

18:34.746 --> 18:36.548
How old was the last one
that was hit by the train?

18:36.882 --> 18:38.050
Do you think he was 80?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.220
One thing is an accident...

18:41.286 --> 18:43.655
There are no accidents here,
asshole!

18:43.722 --> 18:47.759
This is all about greed
and morbid curiosity.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.762
Why do you think they call
to know about the next one?

18:51.096 --> 18:52.798
Do you think
it's because of the bets?

18:52.865 --> 18:56.268
No, they want to see blood.

18:56.635 --> 19:00.606
They want to see how the train
crushes the boy.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.907
That is what they want to see.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.876
And if it'd hit both of them,
much better.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.033
-Vero?
-Lucio!

19:43.749 --> 19:47.386
-Dani, thanks a lot.
-What are you up to?

19:47.719 --> 19:49.821
Have you examined him?
Answer me, please.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
Have you given him
some medication?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.458
I gave him a painkiller.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.160
How is he?
What is his condition?

19:57.729 --> 19:59.064
Don't make it more difficult
for me, Dani.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.767
He has no broken bones.
But I need to take him...

20:01.833 --> 20:03.035
to the clinic
for a thorough examination.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.037
We can't do that.
That'd be too risky.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.173
I'm sorry, we can't.
It's too dangerous.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.875
But I'll take him to a clinic
if he gets worse.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.544
Why is it dangerous?
For whom?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.280
Who was it?
Who did it to him?

20:15.347 --> 20:16.882
Is it related
to the car incident?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.751
Come on, Vero!
I'm not a fool.

20:19.818 --> 20:22.588
-Yes, it's related to that.
-Really?

20:22.921 --> 20:24.056
What's all this mess?

20:24.122 --> 20:25.757
I'll figure it out.
Don't worry.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.827
How? Use your head!
Call dad.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.395
I don't want dad
to get involved.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.097
-He'll know what to do.
-Stay away from it.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.100
You're really dumb.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.969
-Who's that guy?
-A friend.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.471
Thanks for your help, Dani.
I appreciate it.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.106
I'll take care of it
from now on.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.783
Give him three pills a day.

20:53.719 --> 20:57.389
Please, don't call me up
for things like this again.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.494
The car, Dani!
Can I keep it?

21:04.062 --> 21:05.931
-I can't believe it.
-Thanks.

21:12.237 --> 21:13.505
What happened?

21:23.415 --> 21:25.617
Did you know the bald guy
who entered the office...

21:25.684 --> 21:26.818
when you were with Amante?

21:27.152 --> 21:28.420
No, I didn't know him.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.327
It's weird he came
just at that time, right?

21:35.761 --> 21:37.229
Too much of a coincidence.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.598
It's not a coincidence.
They are following me.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.618
There is a gray car parked
halfway down the block.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.721
With stylish tires
and tinted-glass windows.

22:07.192 --> 22:09.294
Isn't that the car
Romerito was talking about?

22:10.729 --> 22:12.064
Yes, I've seen it.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.706
Hello, Fede.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.808
You're downstairs?

22:24.142 --> 22:26.144
Ask Marce to open
the door for you.

22:27.079 --> 22:31.249
Lucio!
Fede, Lucio is going down.

22:31.583 --> 22:32.884
Stop him
before he screws it up.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.020
-Stop, Lucio.
-Leave me alone.

22:52.337 --> 22:53.839
Damn you!

23:05.050 --> 23:07.052
I want to make sure
I can get the permits.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.421
I'm sorry.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.460
I'll be right back.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.068
Hello?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.103
Valrossa realized
I was following him.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.939
How did that happen?

23:28.273 --> 23:29.408
I don't know.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.878
All right.
Forget about him for now.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.146
Did you find the Chinese guy?

23:34.479 --> 23:36.114
I don't know about that
but I can find it out.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.049
Check that out, please.

23:38.483 --> 23:41.553
If they don't take action,
you take care of it.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.188
Fine.

23:53.899 --> 23:54.866
Hello?

23:57.202 --> 23:58.570
We're waiting for the sun
to come down.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.471
There are too many people
in there right now.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.007
But we can do it now
if you want.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.945
The address is 610 Pinto St.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.380
No, I'm on my way.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.289
What you did was wrong, Lucio.

24:19.224 --> 24:21.059
We could've lost the edge
that we have.

24:21.426 --> 24:22.461
What edge?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.831
We've got the children.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.432
We can learn
about the time and place...

24:27.499 --> 24:28.934
of the next competitions.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.436
This is the only way we have
to catch...

24:31.503 --> 24:33.839
those bastards red-handed.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.942
It is the first time
we're one step ahead of them.

24:37.008 --> 24:38.410
Stop cheating yourself,
Verónica.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.946
The edge you're talking about
doesn't exist.

24:41.379 --> 24:42.714
We don't exist.

24:43.215 --> 24:45.183
They will always
be a step ahead.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.785
What do your think about it?

24:48.453 --> 24:50.822
What you want to do
with those kids is crazy.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.824
It's not crazy.

24:53.258 --> 24:57.395
If we don't do it,
the competitions will go on.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.364
Why can't you
understand it, Fede?

24:59.431 --> 25:00.699
If it doesn't happen here,
it'll happen somewhere else.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.101
In the provinces.
Either with trains or trucks.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.437
Competitions will go on.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.606
This is the only chance
we've got.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.608
Because it can be
the last competition.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.344
These guys are in deep water.

25:13.311 --> 25:14.813
All this is
because of the story, right?

25:15.247 --> 25:17.249
-What?
-This is because of the story.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.950
Go to hell!

25:20.919 --> 25:22.387
To write stories is my job.
What I can do about it?

25:22.721 --> 25:24.456
I'm not the one who's putting
the kids in danger.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.591
I've already explained
it to you.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.494
The boy sees the train coming
and jumps off immediately.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.363
-He won't put himself at risk.
-And if Rivero realizes?

25:31.429 --> 25:32.898
Never mind.
We'll have already arrived.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.768
Who is "we"?
You, him and who else?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.272
-You're a lawyer.
-Yes. So?

25:40.338 --> 25:43.575
You must talk to a D.A.
or a judge.

25:43.642 --> 25:45.510
Someone who is willing
to be in charge.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.146
Why don't you tell your father
to talk to a D.A. or a judge?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.182
I can't contact them
about stupid things.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.118
I can't ask them for help
without having evidence.

25:53.184 --> 25:54.886
We must catch them, Fede.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.023
If we can't find someone,
we'll go on our own.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.391
On our own?

25:59.457 --> 26:01.293
Yes, we'll photograph
everything.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.095
Not only Rivero
but also the gamblers.

26:04.429 --> 26:07.265
What about Juan García?
The head of the gang, right?

26:07.599 --> 26:08.500
That's what we believe.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.468
He won't be there.
He works in the shadows.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.070
He isn't likely to be there.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.607
But some of the men we catch
may give him away.

26:23.315 --> 26:26.851
I'm Dientes.
I've got the cell phone.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.858
-Ready.
-You're nuts.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.727
You say that
because you're a chicken.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.363
I'll help unmask them.
I'll be a hero.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.065
I'll be on the papers
and on TV.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.803
Who is it?

26:46.504 --> 26:48.306
-Rivero.
-Don't answer him.

26:51.643 --> 26:52.677
Hello?

26:54.679 --> 26:55.914
I do.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.485
Fine.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.489
Yes, I can make it.
Bye.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.426
-What did he say?
-Was it about the competition?

27:08.493 --> 27:10.328
No, he wants me to go
to the club.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.766
Don't go.
Why does he want you there?

27:15.100 --> 27:16.735
I don't know.
He said it's a surprise.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.404
Maybe he is lying
and it's about the competition.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.941
No, the competition is
on the tracks, not at the club.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.076
Besides, he always
picks you up, doesn't he?

27:25.477 --> 27:26.811
Call the reporter.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.380
No, if I call her
over something irrelevant,

27:28.446 --> 27:29.814
we may ruin the plan.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.184
I'm going.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.320
If I see something weird,
I'll give her a call.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.421
Do you agree with me?

27:41.826 --> 27:45.530
-Are you sure they're fine?
-Yes, don't worry.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.300
They have my number
in case something comes up.

27:50.435 --> 27:51.670
Did you take the painkiller?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.172
Yes, but I still have
a pain in the ribs.

27:56.041 --> 27:59.377
My sister may be right.
You need some x-rays.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.347
No, I'm fine.
I can take it.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.618
I'll take a quick shower...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.219
and I'll let you rest
in my bedroom.

28:08.286 --> 28:09.688
I can sleep here.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.489
No, you need to take
a good rest.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.124
Thanks.

28:25.804 --> 28:30.442
-Did it happen to you?
-What?

28:30.508 --> 28:32.377
Have you been a train driver
for a long time?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.814
Yes, for many years.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.983
Has it ever happened to you?

28:41.019 --> 28:45.557
Did you hit any of the kids
in the pictures over there?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.461
No, I've never hit a boy.
But they stood...

28:49.527 --> 28:50.929
in front of my train
lots of times.

28:56.267 --> 28:57.702
You were the one
who recruited the boys, right?

29:00.472 --> 29:03.408
I didn't know
Rivero wanted them for that.

29:03.842 --> 29:06.044
He asked me to find boys
to play soccer.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.613
I never imagined something
like this could happen.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.516
Did you know Vincen?

29:13.685 --> 29:14.853
Yes, I did.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.090
He sometimes went to the club.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.329
You never wondered
why he never came back?

29:49.654 --> 29:50.755
We are closed.

29:50.822 --> 29:53.324
I just need a cold soda,
please.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.259
We are closed!

29:54.592 --> 29:56.294
I'll take one and I'll leave.

30:00.598 --> 30:01.733
Thanks.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.049
Is there a storage room
up there?

30:23.855 --> 30:26.691
Dientes, he is Martín.
Martín, he is Dientes.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.995
-Hello.
-Say hello to him.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.432
You'll compete against Martín.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.901
I asked you to come
because it's a special occasion.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.736
None of you is a champion.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.673
You're not a champion either?

30:41.739 --> 30:44.709
It's also his first time.
I don't want to take chances.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.479
I want to make sure you two
will resist to the end.

30:48.546 --> 30:50.682
I don't want you to get
cold feet and run away.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.917
-I'll resist.
-Me too.

30:52.984 --> 30:55.920
Everyone says that.
You must to prove it to me.

30:57.455 --> 31:02.160
-So now you'll fight.
-What?

31:02.227 --> 31:03.561
I want you
to beat each other up.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.765
You bastard!
Is that all you can do?

31:10.134 --> 31:11.002
Damn you!

31:11.369 --> 31:13.671
Fine.
Stop it!

31:14.439 --> 31:15.673
Enough!

31:16.074 --> 31:17.275
I said enough.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.311
Stop it!
Can you hear me?

31:21.045 --> 31:22.313
Are you okay?

31:23.514 --> 31:25.817
Put some ice on it
when you get home.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.151
If your mother asks about it,

31:27.218 --> 31:28.286
tell her you fought
with someone in the street.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.988
You too. Is that clear?
Now shake hands.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.323
Come on! Do it!

31:34.893 --> 31:36.461
Very well.
Good bye.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.980
You don't agree with what
I'm going to do, right?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.321
I wasn't thinking about that.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.424
What were you thinking about?

33:04.549 --> 33:05.683
What were you thinking about?

33:20.865 --> 33:22.400
When I am with you,
I have no nightmares.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.932
You gave the gun to Carranza.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.079
When he asked me for it,
I felt...

34:08.146 --> 34:09.614
I shouldn't ask any questions.

34:13.785 --> 34:18.823
He was like a brother to me.
I had to respect his decision.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.730
It wasn't your fault.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.206
Good morning.
I left for the office. Bye.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.103
You have one voice message.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.773
Hi, honey. It's00 p.m.
I'll be home soon.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.243
We couldn't stay over there.
Lucas has a Math test tomorrow.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.612
Where are you?
Call me, please.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.016
The bathroom looks
just as before.

36:25.349 --> 36:29.654
What about the surprise?
Call me.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.896
I've called all your friends.
Where the hell are you?

36:38.963 --> 36:43.334
It's00 a.m., Lucio.
What's wrong? Where are you?

36:47.905 --> 36:48.806
This is crazy.

36:49.574 --> 36:53.644
Will you support me, Pato?
Please, do so.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.514
What do you need?

36:56.847 --> 36:58.616
I need Lucho.
And Vicky, if possible.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.986
Lucho can go,
but Vicky is on vacation.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.290
One photographer is not enough.
I need at least two.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.292
They are the best.
I need them.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.529
-Well, let me ask her.
-What will you say to her?

37:11.596 --> 37:13.264
You can't tell her
anything about this.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.600
-I must give her a clue.
-No, nothing.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.201
If there is a leak,
they may cancel it.

37:17.568 --> 37:21.339
I'll tell her myself.
Tell her it's something big.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.140
She should trust you.
That should be enough for her.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.076
All right.
I'll have a go.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.612
-There is something else.
-What?

37:28.346 --> 37:30.514
-All this...
-You want a cover story.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.017
I know but unless I see
some results,

37:33.084 --> 37:35.119
I don't think it'll be possible.

37:37.655 --> 37:38.589
Come in.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.694
Hi, Vero.
Weren't you on leave?

37:44.028 --> 37:47.298
Yes, I've just stopped by
to say hi.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.468
Remember that story
about the Chinese mafia?

37:50.534 --> 37:52.436
They've found
another Chinese man dead.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.039
-Where?
-In Lugano.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.242
They tortured him all night
and then they killed him.

37:58.309 --> 38:00.378
-And his wife too.
-In Lugano?

38:01.679 --> 38:04.515
-Was it a food market?
-Yes.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.852
Do you have the address?

38:11.355 --> 38:14.592
Pick up!
Come on!

38:19.063 --> 38:20.498
Damn!

38:29.073 --> 38:30.107
Hello?

38:30.174 --> 38:31.108
Are you far away from home?

38:31.442 --> 38:32.643
No, a couple of blocks away.
Why?

38:33.010 --> 38:34.245
You have to come back.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.780
I can't, my wife arrived
unexpectedly...

38:35.846 --> 38:37.214
and left me a hundred messages.

38:37.615 --> 38:38.549
You have to come back now.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.185
What's wrong?

38:45.756 --> 38:46.924
All right, I'm coming.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.308
What do we do now?

39:06.377 --> 39:07.578
Kill her too.

39:09.747 --> 39:10.948
What about Valrossa?

39:13.584 --> 39:16.387
He should've been dead
long ago.

39:19.323 --> 39:21.425
Fine, I'll send you
the material.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.294
But try to get involved
this time.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.597
No, I won't get you
into trouble.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.600
Yes, I understand you.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.671
I have to hang up.
I have an incoming call.

39:34.004 --> 39:36.374
Talk to you later.
Thanks.

39:37.541 --> 39:41.145
Hello, Vero.
I was talking to the D.A.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.213
Rafa's friend was killed.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.115
The Chinese man.
And his wife.

39:44.448 --> 39:45.983
They made everyone believe
the Chinese mafia...

39:46.050 --> 39:48.085
was behind it,
but I know it was them.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.621
Calm down.
I don't understand.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.256
What don't you understand?

39:52.323 --> 39:53.557
They left some graffiti
with a Chinese symbol.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.460
But it was them.
Things are really bad.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.129
They tortured him to death.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.997
Where are you now?

40:00.064 --> 40:02.867
On my way home.
I fear they might go there.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.135
Lucio is two blocks away.

40:04.201 --> 40:05.836
We must get Rafa
out of there urgently.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.006
What can Lucio do about it?
Let's call the police.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.976
What police department
do you want to call?

40:13.978 --> 40:15.579
Fine, I'll meet you there.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.081
Hurry up, please.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.207
Get dressed.
We have to leave.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.143
-What happened?
-Hurry up.

41:31.789 --> 41:32.990
-Hurry up!
-What's up?

41:33.324 --> 41:34.558
I don't have a key.
We can't leave the door open.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.761
We have to get out of here.
Let's go! Quickly!

42:22.306 --> 42:25.309
-Where are we going?
-My car is over there.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.948
-What is going on?
-Let's go to my car.

42:34.418 --> 42:35.352
Damn!

42:48.432 --> 42:49.400
Damn!

42:56.173 --> 42:58.442
Damn you, bastard!

43:01.845 --> 43:03.113
See you, punk!

43:16.627 --> 43:19.530
-You must leave, Lucio.
-Where to?

43:19.597 --> 43:20.664
I don't know.
You can't be in jail.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.099
Not even for five minutes.
You must leave right now.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.635
-Go away, Lucio!
-He was shot in the leg.

43:27.137 --> 43:28.372
-How are you?
-Fine.

43:28.706 --> 43:29.907
-What happened?
-I got shot.

43:33.644 --> 43:34.378
ON THE NEXT EPISODE...
- Forgive me
