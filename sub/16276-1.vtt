01:34.605 --> 01:36.955
Is your serial killer
and my favorite,

01:36.956 --> 01:39.052

My gifts
foresight helped

01:42.710 --> 01:45.772
police to arrest him
and indict it.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.132
My father worked very
to move up the company.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.000
He did not deserve to die like that.

01:50.001 --> 01:51.844
I hope he
rot in jail.

This is a positive result.

the prisoner Thomas Reddmann.

02:15.790 --> 02:18.647
The circumstances of the attempt
escape are unclear.

02:18.648 --> 02:22.657
However, it seems that Reddmann
was viciously attacked.

02:22.658 --> 02:24.522
The good news is that
Thomas Reddmann,

02:24.523 --> 02:27.727

Nothing at all.

I'm really looking
an opportunity.

02:53.868 --> 02:56.375
I do not see how this can
succeed, Annabelle.

07:33.502 --> 07:35.552
Listen, do not misunderstand me.

07:35.553 --> 07:39.767

What?

07:57.874 --> 08:00.103
Can anyone tell me the
What is happening?

08:00.104 --> 08:02.832
I do not know, but it is not good thing.

08:04.362 --> 08:06.900
We have to leave. Seriously.

08:11.031 --> 08:13.562
Stop. Stop all.

08:14.312 --> 08:15.804
Hey, stop.

09:51.108 --> 09:52.408
Who are you?

09:52.409 --> 09:54.182
A psychic should not know?

09:54.183 --> 09:57.710
- I was an eyewitness.
- Me too.

09:57.711 --> 10:01.460
The stripper Internet.
How could I forget?

10:02.456 --> 10:05.964
And that man
led the charge.

10:44.035 --> 10:46.206
Shit, can not be.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.882

do not stop until I tell you.

12:04.946 --> 12:06.591
My name is Redd.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.604
I'm the new boss.

12:22.096 --> 12:24.419
I identified the corpse.

12:25.939 --> 12:27.783
So how is he still alive?

13:23.381 --> 13:26.645

can not see without them.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.533
Feel headaches.

Just do something.

13:34.913 --> 13:37.101
Show him that
is doing something.

14:09.955 --> 14:13.694
Seems to be very sore.

14:14.714 --> 14:16.371
It is not so bad.

14:17.411 --> 14:20.122
I do not believe that we are
trapped in a slaughterhouse.

14:20.123 --> 14:21.878
A slaughterhouse?

14:22.336 --> 14:24.365
This service office.

14:25.647 --> 14:29.448

time and now...

Really?

14:40.294 --> 14:42.330
I do not know.

14:43.339 --> 14:46.546
It just seemed the thing
right to say.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.714
Shit.

14:56.577 --> 14:58.602
Come on, this is crazy.

14:58.603 --> 15:01.030
- He's playing with us.
- No.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.098
He is breaking us.

15:40.853 --> 15:43.093
It seems that you are the
winner.

15:44.298 --> 15:45.776
An incentive.

15:45.777 --> 15:47.513
You can stop now.

15:48.028 --> 15:49.943
Start again in the morning.

15:53.263 --> 15:55.772
I did not tell you
could begin.

15:55.773 --> 15:59.555
If you obey the rules,
you will eat tomorrow.

15:59.556 --> 16:01.099
Fuck you.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.733
I drive rigidly.

16:24.355 --> 16:27.587
I am firm but fair.

16:27.947 --> 16:31.536

16:31.537 --> 16:34.723
Firm and fair. me

16:36.697 --> 16:38.159
Now...

16:38.160 --> 16:40.936

need to understand

16:40.937 --> 16:44.434
is that every act
disobedience,

16:44.435 --> 16:46.525
comes a warning.

16:47.261 --> 16:48.877

17:50.378 --> 17:53.830
I do not have my glasses,
I do not see well without them.

17:53.831 --> 17:55.335
Seriously?

17:55.814 --> 17:57.279
Does not have glasses?

17:57.931 --> 17:59.523
Just a moment.

18:17.594 --> 18:20.176
Try this. Come on.

18:30.285 --> 18:33.180

- Better, thanks.

18:33.508 --> 18:37.376
So, no more excuses. has

22:09.394 --> 22:11.221
Is anyone there?

22:41.400 --> 22:42.739
Shit.

22:43.843 --> 22:45.143
Time's up.

22:59.043 --> 23:02.914
I said that the time is up.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.592
I'm ready.

23:13.406 --> 23:15.522
You have exceeded your time.

23:26.816 --> 23:28.896
This is your first warning.

23:28.897 --> 23:31.177
Understand, it's nothing personal.

24:03.836 --> 24:05.256
What is there to?

24:07.758 --> 24:10.773
- Any sign of where we are?
- You must have seen something.

24:11.304 --> 24:12.904
Anything.

25:22.194 --> 25:25.461
- Holy shit.
- Nightmare?

25:28.297 --> 25:29.598
Yes.

25:33.688 --> 25:36.255
Everything is a nightmare.

25:38.951 --> 25:41.231
I thought this place
was a nightmare.

25:43.655 --> 25:45.925
This place is a nightmare.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.183
I do not need to go to the bathroom.

26:10.686 --> 26:13.195
I do not need to go to the bathroom.

Are you the same Annabelle
Hale, eyewitness

26:56.302 --> 26:58.279
the trial
Thomas Reddmann?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.090
Yes.

27:02.242 --> 27:03.543
You said :

27:03.898 --> 27:07.854
"I saw Thomas Reddmann
holding the ax. "

27:07.855 --> 27:10.242
" He was covered in blood. "

27:10.839 --> 27:14.421
" The body of Shelly Bloom
was on the floor of the elevator. "

27:14.822 --> 27:18.471
- Okay, that's what I said.
- " Headless. "

27:19.530 --> 27:20.831
I was wrong.

27:21.566 --> 27:26.412
Said the decapitated body
was in the elevator. Correct?

27:28.199 --> 27:33.439
Also acknowledged that there
saw the killer strike.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.015
His words.

27:35.633 --> 27:39.176
You have not seen me use
actually the ax.

27:39.989 --> 27:42.604
No, I have not seen.

27:43.187 --> 27:44.587
Very well, then.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.250
This is your task.

27:47.892 --> 27:49.771
This is your
work, Annabelle.

27:49.772 --> 27:51.987
find the
real killer.

27:51.988 --> 27:54.167
Because I am you
saying now...

27:54.495 --> 27:57.528
I'm not the Decapitator.

28:51.741 --> 28:54.521
The body of Mr
Demayer lay

28:54.991 --> 28:56.975
against the table in
conference room.

28:56.976 --> 29:00.538
The head had rolled
on the other side.

29:00.539 --> 29:03.233
I heard a hiss behind me.

29:04.025 --> 29:07.885
When I turned not
was no one there.

29:12.128 --> 29:15.136
I walked in and...

29:15.513 --> 29:20.109
Mr. Ketchup was
sitting there as always.

29:50.984 --> 29:55.169
Edward, do not know what
should look here.

29:55.757 --> 29:57.700
If we were
investigating a case

29:57.701 --> 30:00.374
would be looking
patterns and inconsistencies.

30:00.864 --> 30:02.882
But we are not
working on a case.

30:03.290 --> 30:05.389
The killer is in
office right there.

30:06.966 --> 30:10.087
What we need to do is
pretend that we are busy

30:10.088 --> 30:13.064
- And stay alive.
- Thank you.

30:15.727 --> 30:18.575
Patterns and inconsistencies.

30:32.777 --> 30:34.956
Please do not! No!

30:36.476 --> 30:41.604
- Marcus, you know what happens.
- Please do not!

30:41.605 --> 30:43.300
Who is Marcus?

30:44.266 --> 30:45.650
Wait a minute.

30:49.276 --> 30:53.328
Marcus Conlon, the
judge in this case.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.302
Has been missing for months.

30:57.045 --> 31:00.568
Why would he want
Conlon hurt?

31:00.997 --> 31:03.296
Conlon sent him
Clinic Lansdale.

31:03.297 --> 31:05.748
Padded walls and all
benefits it can have.

31:05.749 --> 31:08.410
- It is a hotel with medications.
- No it is not.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.664
Clinic Lansdale,

31:13.530 --> 31:15.134
the part you can see,

31:15.135 --> 31:17.200
is exactly as Annabelle says.

31:18.089 --> 31:19.554
But Lansdale...

31:22.056 --> 31:27.000
have some ideas about
criminal minds.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.900
Some procedures,

31:29.901 --> 31:35.700
chemical and surgical, which
are not fully legal.

31:36.173 --> 31:40.304
- And the results vary.
- Surgical?

31:41.485 --> 31:43.717
He has scars on his head.

31:44.053 --> 31:49.067
Guy noted that when the
hit, he even dropped?

31:49.068 --> 31:52.600
- Yes
- He does not feel pain.

31:52.601 --> 31:56.300
Whoever Thomas
Reddmann before Lansdale,

31:56.301 --> 31:58.035
that person was.

31:58.507 --> 32:00.466
We have to talk to him.

32:01.394 --> 32:03.210
Making regains reason.

32:03.211 --> 32:05.650
No, Sheena, not
I think a good idea.

32:16.738 --> 32:18.206
Hello, workers.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.514
You know what is
doing here is wrong.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.355
It is, Thomas?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.958
Can I call you Thomas?

32:36.099 --> 32:37.825
You know my name.

32:38.185 --> 32:40.457
Sheena O'Leary.

32:41.857 --> 32:43.667
We are all people.

32:43.968 --> 32:47.963
We all have friends and
family like you.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.614
How do I?

32:50.394 --> 32:52.504
You're not a man ma...

32:53.400 --> 32:56.137
You do not really want
hurt people.

32:57.965 --> 32:59.836
That man...

33:00.388 --> 33:02.298
In the other room...

33:03.058 --> 33:05.400
Also do not want to hurt him.

33:06.638 --> 33:08.644
Maybe I want.

33:09.259 --> 33:14.050
Maybe some people
deserve to receive a lot of pain.

33:14.051 --> 33:16.494
I think we should
back to work.

33:17.078 --> 33:21.400
And the guy? And friends
and his family?

33:22.062 --> 33:23.463
His children?

33:24.056 --> 33:27.577
You say innocent but killed
man, for God's sake!

33:27.578 --> 33:31.595
Calm down. is troubling
their coworkers.

33:31.596 --> 33:35.748
- Sheena, Redd is right.
- You're an assassin!

33:40.057 --> 33:42.500
I said to calm down!

33:46.806 --> 33:49.723
This is not a good way
to start the day!

33:52.317 --> 33:54.368
Let's make this clear.

33:55.664 --> 33:58.974
I'm not a murderer.

33:59.584 --> 34:03.378
I am the Regional Manager.

34:11.078 --> 34:15.600
Find the real killer
today and will go home today.

34:16.239 --> 34:20.661
Linger six months,
will stay here six months.

34:20.661 --> 34:24.978
Remember that for every
second wasted

34:25.483 --> 34:30.728
one ruthless killer is loose
enjoying freedom

34:30.728 --> 34:32.900
you do not have.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.385
For the love of God.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.467
Everything went well.

34:46.223 --> 34:48.818
No, seriously. was
a very good idea.

34:48.819 --> 34:50.833
Maybe I could have helped me.

34:52.150 --> 34:55.438
If any appeal,
maybe he let us go.

35:29.107 --> 35:33.175
- I know how he managed.
- Got what?

35:33.176 --> 35:35.730
As Redd forged
death itself.

35:35.731 --> 35:39.239
The remains found in fire
Clinic in Lansdale were not his.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.090
Were someone else.

35:41.091 --> 35:43.797
He must have cut
his arm

35:43.798 --> 35:47.283
knowing that it was all we could
use for DNA analysis.

35:47.641 --> 35:49.608
It was all set.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.520
So as escaped
another patient

35:53.521 --> 35:57.200
and used it as dead meat?

35:57.591 --> 36:00.200
- And cut off his own arm?
- I said.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.400
Clinic Lansdale
changes people.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.098
- Damn!
- Jesus, William. Okay?

36:11.071 --> 36:12.371
William.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.469
Can I help you with something?

36:25.556 --> 36:28.978
It's okay. It's just a sliver.

36:28.979 --> 36:33.935
Yes, start small, but
infection can spread.

36:33.936 --> 36:35.400
And we do not want that.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.200
Found.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.900
Is prof undo.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.000
Got it.

37:13.855 --> 37:15.533
Right.

37:15.534 --> 37:18.750
Now you have to
tear the nail.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.902
But do not look for them.

37:21.903 --> 37:23.809
They can not stop the infection.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.111
Do it.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.000
Now get back to work.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.869
And remember,

38:07.523 --> 38:10.449
My door is always open.

38:17.347 --> 38:19.395
Damn, William.

38:19.899 --> 38:23.449
Need to get out more.
Have more style.

38:23.450 --> 38:26.750
There are many cheap perfumes
ties and horrible here.

38:26.751 --> 38:29.120
Anyway, I'm at the airport now.

38:29.121 --> 38:32.183
So, know what you have
to do, then do it.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.731
Why are we stopping here?
There is not even...

38:37.427 --> 38:39.578
End of messages.

38:43.362 --> 38:46.029
Why are we stopping here?
There is not even...

38:48.032 --> 38:50.190
End of messages.

38:51.070 --> 38:52.977
're Having any progress?

38:57.247 --> 38:58.548
No.

38:59.116 --> 39:01.335
Actually no. You?

39:05.351 --> 39:07.644
That'll teach him
to be civilized.

39:15.879 --> 39:18.903
I would smell the
her hair for the last time.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.592
My wife.

39:22.332 --> 39:24.400
Her hair smells good.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.628
I hope someone's
feeding my dogs.

39:29.516 --> 39:31.367
What are their names?

39:31.855 --> 39:34.175
Reason and Doubt.

39:35.759 --> 39:41.300
I regret not having focused
talking to my mother.

39:41.301 --> 39:43.393
They years.

39:44.602 --> 39:46.559
Did not get along well.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.718
You know what really
regret?

39:54.567 --> 39:56.560
Do not have told my
chief stupid

39:56.561 --> 39:58.800
threading employment in the ass.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.300
I honestly thought
had a boss hell.

40:08.386 --> 40:10.800
I think there is a way out.

40:11.436 --> 40:14.993
The women's bathroom. There is a grid
which may lead outward.

40:14.994 --> 40:17.684
- You can open it?
- No, but I'm trying.

40:32.042 --> 40:34.986
Anyone else feeling
a strange taste in the mouth?

40:34.987 --> 40:40.000
- Yes, as a chemical taste.
- We are being drugged.

40:41.642 --> 40:45.400
Do you think he will do
something while we sleep?

40:45.717 --> 40:48.508
We must stay awake
at any cost.

42:37.072 --> 42:39.537
I'm glad we do not need
to look at him.

42:39.538 --> 42:41.809
Maybe you can
channel it later.

42:41.810 --> 42:45.100
We will focus
to continue living.

42:45.101 --> 42:47.501
There is no way to reason with him.
It is a psychopath.

42:47.502 --> 42:50.200
Deduced this through
psychic powers, right?

42:50.512 --> 42:52.160
We should start working.

42:52.161 --> 42:55.839
While we continue to
tasks, we gain time.

43:58.989 --> 44:01.247
This is not a game
divination.

44:01.783 --> 44:04.357
Times and dates, detectives.

44:05.261 --> 44:09.160
Seperate. Punctuality.

44:09.650 --> 44:11.239
Accuracy.

44:12.016 --> 44:13.690
Facts.

44:34.762 --> 44:37.379
At this rate, we
killed within 2 days.

44:38.194 --> 44:40.876
Sheena find anything?

44:41.212 --> 44:46.379
Say this is not a
ideal working environment.

44:46.380 --> 44:50.150
- I mean for someone like you?
- For any of us.

44:52.855 --> 44:56.869
- What number just enter?
- Do not throw divination with you.

44:56.870 --> 44:58.510
That's all you do.

44:58.511 --> 45:02.053
You just assumed, and
hopes to get lucky.

45:02.054 --> 45:04.032
I will not have this
conversation with you.

45:04.033 --> 45:05.456
So talk to me.

45:06.095 --> 45:09.702
Not sure
believe in what you do,

45:09.703 --> 45:13.802
but if you can send a
message to someone,

45:14.486 --> 45:17.217
need to do it now.

45:17.218 --> 45:20.479
- Are you serious?
- Have a better idea?

45:21.211 --> 45:25.136
It does not hurt, right?

45:27.569 --> 45:32.340
I think you should try.
Please try.

45:33.031 --> 45:34.331
Alright.

45:52.998 --> 45:56.992
The truth is
easily understood.

45:58.563 --> 46:00.674
But it is very difficult
keep it with you.

46:03.464 --> 46:07.362
Some people are
skeptical by nature.

46:07.742 --> 46:10.841
It's part of the job
them question everything.

46:12.393 --> 46:15.342
Many are easily
convinced

46:15.343 --> 46:17.756
by what they see and hear.

46:18.923 --> 46:21.058
" Seeing is believing. "

46:22.395 --> 46:28.097
Others see the truth as
an accumulation of facts.

46:28.713 --> 46:32.693
Evidence not
may be denied.

46:34.439 --> 46:36.814
And depots, there are those

46:36.815 --> 46:41.087
who see the truth as
a piece of clay

46:41.088 --> 46:42.488
which can be modeled.

46:43.082 --> 46:44.726
An art form.

46:45.211 --> 46:47.175
Another form of lying.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.159
Sheena O'Leary.

46:54.296 --> 46:57.610
Renowned psychic and medium.

46:58.130 --> 47:00.567
He helped the police
recently

47:00.568 --> 47:03.615
the case of homicide
the Decapitator.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.853
One might ask :

47:07.202 --> 47:10.720
" Why did you choose
lend their powers

47:10.721 --> 47:13.185
for this particular case. "

47:15.082 --> 47:18.351
I helped the police
in many cases.

47:18.352 --> 47:20.911
You did well after
this case, is not it?

47:20.912 --> 47:22.843
You have become renowned.

47:23.266 --> 47:24.566
Helped identify

47:24.567 --> 47:27.176
the big bad Decapitator.

47:27.714 --> 47:29.847
Convinced almost everyone.

47:30.298 --> 47:32.475
My gift is often
misinterpreted.

47:32.476 --> 47:35.594
Dom? Calls it a gift?

47:36.103 --> 47:39.341
Interesting, because I
correct if I'm wrong,

47:39.342 --> 47:41.757
but a gift is something that is
usually given for free.

47:41.758 --> 47:46.796
And you charge $ 5.95 per
minute for your gift.

47:48.534 --> 47:53.396
You say you can see the future.

47:53.397 --> 47:54.960
Correct?

47:55.540 --> 47:58.833
I can sometimes.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.986
But you could not
predict it here, is not it?

48:10.293 --> 48:13.280
You can not see anything, can you?

48:15.331 --> 48:16.632
Can?

48:18.445 --> 48:19.817
No.

48:23.094 --> 48:25.278
Then you will not need it.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.796
That was not so hard, was it?

49:06.365 --> 49:08.665
Redd, she suffered
enough!

49:08.666 --> 49:09.966
No!

49:19.588 --> 49:21.741
Now she has suffered enough.

49:38.944 --> 49:40.245
Right.

49:41.202 --> 49:42.767
Back to work.

49:49.245 --> 49:51.269
We will all die here.

49:52.481 --> 49:54.099
As she.

49:55.282 --> 49:57.534
We will all die here.

49:58.604 --> 49:59.904
We will all die.

50:31.482 --> 50:34.140
What girl she was messy.

50:40.803 --> 50:45.372
- Shall I...?
- Yes, Mr. Tucker.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.851
Well pretty clean.

50:47.852 --> 50:49.987
Well squeaky clean!

50:54.914 --> 50:55.414
Right.

51:35.034 --> 51:37.018
This work is shit.

51:55.765 --> 51:57.607
Good job, Mr. Tucker.

51:58.284 --> 51:59.851
Very impressive.

52:02.009 --> 52:04.683
I'm glad you're happy.

52:04.684 --> 52:06.697
That's the attitude.

52:07.902 --> 52:10.313
If only this attitude
show more evidence

52:10.314 --> 52:12.065
in his other work.

52:12.066 --> 52:14.332
In fact, I fear that
I have to express

52:14.333 --> 52:16.235
my great dissatisfaction

52:16.236 --> 52:18.955
with the work of
group in general.

52:19.475 --> 52:22.931
A company that does not
get results

52:22.932 --> 52:25.371
can not sustain itself.

52:25.372 --> 52:28.541
And a company that does not
can sustain

52:28.542 --> 52:32.981
should start to reassess
position of its employees.

52:35.341 --> 52:38.359
It's time for an analysis
performance.

52:40.245 --> 52:41.545
Right.

52:52.577 --> 52:58.234
I want you to think about
day I saw...

52:59.523 --> 53:01.766
Why was the building?

53:02.539 --> 53:06.223
I had gone out and drunk
the night before.

53:06.790 --> 53:11.396
I was hungover and late
for a job interview.

53:17.674 --> 53:19.826
You said I was laughing.

53:20.327 --> 53:22.039
That's how I remember.

53:22.772 --> 53:26.430
And then I heard someone screaming.

53:26.431 --> 53:29.084
And I realized it was me.

53:31.717 --> 53:35.455
I had to make a delivery
a small publisher.

53:36.329 --> 53:40.303
I remember seeing a girl

53:40.304 --> 53:42.540
that seemed not to work there.

53:47.017 --> 53:49.009
Now I know it was Annabelle.

53:49.447 --> 53:52.000
Then the doors
elevator opened.

53:56.077 --> 53:57.626
And you looked terrified.

53:59.191 --> 54:01.246
As if in
shock.

54:01.650 --> 54:04.327
I was tracking the
Decapitator for months.

54:04.328 --> 54:07.587
He was sure of where and when
would be the next murder,

54:07.588 --> 54:09.247
just did not know who it was.

54:09.248 --> 54:11.336
I got to the lobby
and there you were.

54:11.923 --> 54:14.134
I told you to put
the ax on the ground.

54:16.130 --> 54:20.660
After a moment you accepted,
so I decided not to use the weapon.

54:21.273 --> 54:23.242
And I busted.

54:23.999 --> 54:27.105
I tried my best to
absolve him, Redd.

54:28.162 --> 54:30.847
- You can be sure.
- Really?

54:31.888 --> 54:36.397
The proof of the accusation
was overwhelming.

54:39.244 --> 54:41.210
Guy Marr and police said

54:41.211 --> 54:44.502
I beheaded Michelle
Bloom in the elevator.

54:44.503 --> 54:46.503
- Correct?
- Correct.

54:46.504 --> 54:48.050
And no one saw the murder,

54:48.051 --> 54:50.415
because the camera
elevator was off.

54:50.416 --> 54:51.901
- Correct?
- Yes

54:52.515 --> 54:55.457
I think you forgot
an important test.

54:56.220 --> 54:59.684
Know that the elevator in question
was custom?

55:00.790 --> 55:02.090
No.

55:02.994 --> 55:05.889
But know the elevators
the Millo & Brand?

55:11.786 --> 55:17.226
This black line is the height of the
Common lifts made ​​by them.

55:19.185 --> 55:20.922
But this red line

55:21.294 --> 55:26.390
is the highest point of
lift Custom.

55:26.391 --> 55:28.237
Our elevator.

55:29.537 --> 55:30.837
Right.

55:32.038 --> 55:37.261
You know how much pressure is needed
to decapitate someone?

55:38.136 --> 55:40.022
No, I do not know.

55:42.720 --> 55:48.317
Because when the killer
Masked beheaded Michelle,

55:48.318 --> 55:51.648
prosecutors said
he used the ax

55:51.649 --> 55:55.569
as a guillotine to cut
skin, tendons and bone,

55:55.570 --> 55:58.773
using an immense force.

55:59.408 --> 56:00.861
So...

56:01.661 --> 56:03.297
No, Redd, please.

56:52.580 --> 56:54.114
Thank God.

56:56.058 --> 56:57.662
What happened there?

56:59.145 --> 57:00.580
Are you okay?

57:33.559 --> 57:36.084
- Who is Peter Bava?
- What?

57:41.028 --> 57:42.878
Is listed as
eyewitness

57:42.879 --> 57:44.350
but he was never heard.

57:44.351 --> 57:45.934
Maybe he 's gone.

57:45.935 --> 57:47.246
I thought so too,

57:47.247 --> 57:49.439
but his statement
listed as evidence

57:49.440 --> 57:51.130
the document has been removed.

57:51.131 --> 57:52.696
Edward.

57:53.455 --> 57:54.756
Edward?

57:55.284 --> 57:57.579
You know Peter Bava?

58:01.806 --> 58:05.720
It's your signature
down here, right?

58:08.674 --> 58:12.521
Edward is your signature?

58:16.208 --> 58:20.344
- It seems, but...
- Or is or is not.

58:20.345 --> 58:22.470
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

58:24.599 --> 58:27.011
That was long ago.

58:27.012 --> 58:30.202
Know in how many cases
worked since then?

58:30.203 --> 58:33.457
Why should I care
in cases other than this?

58:33.458 --> 58:36.185
Redd could not have
murdered Shelly Bloom.

58:36.186 --> 58:37.708
What?

58:37.709 --> 58:40.520
No, I'm not saying that.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.369
I just wanted to know
who Peter Bava.

58:45.584 --> 58:48.639
There was not enough space
to move the ax.

58:54.058 --> 58:55.458
Edward.

58:56.374 --> 58:58.037
What are you hiding?

59:03.445 --> 59:09.026
Depots I hold Reddmann the
media all came after me.

59:10.425 --> 59:13.373
" The detective Crandell
took the Decapitator. "

59:13.844 --> 59:15.888
And Reddmann was so calm.

59:16.816 --> 59:19.222
He had great faith in the system.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.662
He had alibis for bad
other murders.

59:23.663 --> 59:25.186
He was always working,

59:25.187 --> 59:28.687
and when he was not in the office
had no evidence of where he was.

59:28.688 --> 59:31.861
But, in the second death...

59:34.369 --> 59:36.657
He had an alibi in the second.

59:38.462 --> 59:41.635
The murder of the Decapitator
on October 14.

59:42.147 --> 59:44.400
Redd was resigning
an employee

59:44.401 --> 59:46.453
for having a bad attitude.

59:46.454 --> 59:51.824
The employee was a
Bava guy named Peter.

59:52.887 --> 59:55.197
I asked if he was sure

59:55.198 --> 59:57.458
who was dismissed in the 14th.

59:57.846 --> 01:00:00.821
- And he said...
- Yeah, man, look.

01:00:01.149 --> 01:00:04.652
He gave me a
resignation letter.

01:00:04.653 --> 01:00:07.246
Seriously, I took a picture.

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:10.073
The day I
resigned from that place

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.472
was the best day of my life.

01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:13.773
Come on, Peter.

01:00:13.774 --> 01:00:16.829
That guy is crazy.

01:00:17.274 --> 01:00:19.174
Any detective
work on the streets

01:00:19.175 --> 01:00:21.114
knows that has 80% proof

01:00:21.115 --> 01:00:22.615
you can find the rest.

01:00:22.616 --> 01:00:25.464
I had 80 % of
tests, even more.

01:00:25.465 --> 01:00:27.943
I kept repeating to me that
had the right guy

01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:30.155
Until then Peter Bava.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.440
I always knew that there would be
a special place

01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:37.374
in hell
me for what I did.

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:40.750
And I took a shot at work
and ended up in this chair.

01:00:41.227 --> 01:00:44.010
I felt as if I had
paid my debt.

01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:46.622
So we are all
here for you.

01:00:46.623 --> 01:00:50.799
Because you incompetent
or because it is corrupt?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.203
- Now call me corrupt?
- You hid evidence.

01:00:54.509 --> 01:00:57.064
I'm no expert, but
seems to be corruption.

01:00:57.065 --> 01:00:58.756
It was only a witness!

01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:02.721
Just hid a witness.

01:01:02.722 --> 01:01:04.772
It is very easy to judge me now.

01:01:04.773 --> 01:01:07.283
But at that time, had
lot of pressure on me.

01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:09.331
I had to arrest someone.

01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:15.317
Damn.

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:21.776
Edward.

01:01:23.924 --> 01:01:26.347
Is there something you wanna tell me?

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:28.771
Redd.

01:01:32.763 --> 01:01:34.254
We can talk about it.

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:35.555
With this new evidence,

01:01:35.556 --> 01:01:37.711
I can get
a new trial.

01:01:37.712 --> 01:01:40.348
But there is new evidence, is not it?

01:01:41.027 --> 01:01:45.498
It is an evidence that was
deliberately concealed by you.

01:01:45.499 --> 01:01:46.997
Please.

01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:12.806
What is this?

01:02:13.685 --> 01:02:15.164
What are you doing?

01:02:22.514 --> 01:02:23.815
This is...

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:26.090
This is my blood?

01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:31.263
This is my blood?

01:02:39.133 --> 01:02:40.730
This is my leg?

01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:45.451
That's my damn leg?

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.108
What 's the verdict, Judge Conlon?

01:02:52.828 --> 01:02:56.402
- A leg or two?
- No!

01:02:56.762 --> 01:03:00.944
Please do not!

01:03:01.868 --> 01:03:04.547
No!

01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:37.223
FUCK FUCK FUCK...

01:04:18.575 --> 01:04:19.876
This.

01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:11.566
Redd.

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:14.187
Why are not you sleeping?

01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:17.882
I was. I need
go to the bathroom.

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:19.382
People need to learn

01:06:19.383 --> 01:06:21.271
to have a little
respect.

01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:23.035
Really...

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:25.346
Really need to go.

01:06:32.942 --> 01:06:34.600
Always have something.

01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:48.390
Five minutes.

01:06:53.129 --> 01:06:54.429
Come on!

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:44.479
Shit.

01:09:21.429 --> 01:09:24.091
My God!

01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:27.792
HELLO, MY NAME IS MARCUS Conlon

01:10:16.981 --> 01:10:18.281
No.

01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:21.101
It was not for you to die.

01:10:21.102 --> 01:10:22.952
You have to suffer.

01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.329
Not tortured enough?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.701
You do not understand, do you?

01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:36.000
I am an innocent man.

01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:39.482
The only thing we had to
was doing your duty.

01:10:39.483 --> 01:10:42.553
Pay a little attention
when eyewitness.

01:10:42.554 --> 01:10:46.060
Investigate a little
when someone calls.

01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:48.048
Do not hide evidence.

01:10:48.618 --> 01:10:52.195
If you, idiots, had
done it, there...

01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:51.187
I'm for it.

01:11:52.228 --> 01:11:56.858
Wake up, wake up.

01:11:56.859 --> 01:11:59.526
Wake up, wake up, shit!

01:11:59.527 --> 01:12:01.105
Yes, we're out of here.

01:12:01.547 --> 01:12:03.331
- What?
- We're out of here.

01:12:06.019 --> 01:12:07.319
Where is Redd?

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.991
I knocked him down.

01:12:14.216 --> 01:12:15.523
Damn.

01:12:21.927 --> 01:12:24.561
- Wake up.
- Okay, I'm awake.

01:12:33.453 --> 01:12:34.753
Thank you.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.353
For God's sake, let's go.

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.830
Come.

01:13:08.522 --> 01:13:12.852
Well.. Back to work!

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:20.521
Bring everyone!

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:22.692
I'll leave the phone
is the hook.

01:13:22.693 --> 01:13:24.187
They are coming.

01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:35.662
We need weapons.

01:13:53.411 --> 01:13:56.022
We will even kill
face with this stuff?

01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:58.028
Let's try.

01:14:37.454 --> 01:14:39.523
- Where is he?
- I do not know.

01:14:41.627 --> 01:14:42.927
Damn.

01:14:47.892 --> 01:14:49.192
Come on.

01:14:52.145 --> 01:14:53.445
Run!

01:14:55.937 --> 01:14:57.237
Run!

01:14:58.712 --> 01:15:01.946
- Ali
- Go, go!

01:15:04.101 --> 01:15:05.635
Wait.

01:15:10.337 --> 01:15:11.638
Staff.

01:15:12.253 --> 01:15:15.087
I was an innocent man

01:15:15.088 --> 01:15:19.566
when Dr. Lansdale
I turned it.

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:21.967
Tell me, Miss Hale,

01:15:21.968 --> 01:15:24.462
what would you do in my place?

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:26.090
Alright, Redd.

01:15:26.091 --> 01:15:28.032
It is not just what
done to you.

01:15:28.033 --> 01:15:30.771
Just wanted people
do their work.

01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:32.620
What do your duties.

01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:34.553
Except that it does not
is our duty.

01:15:34.554 --> 01:15:35.855
Any of us.

01:15:35.856 --> 01:15:40.960
Then tuck your
employment in the ass!

01:15:41.618 --> 01:15:44.735
- Damn!
- I'll hold you up. Go!

01:15:45.483 --> 01:15:47.611
Do not take another step.

01:15:53.389 --> 01:15:54.733
Come on.

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:01.234
- And Rudy?
- You are dead.

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:15.712
My God.

01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:23.646
Shit, what a waste.

01:16:29.814 --> 01:16:33.395
I'm afraid I'll have to fire him.

01:17:15.929 --> 01:17:19.848
Annabelle, you
have to understand.

01:17:19.849 --> 01:17:21.880
It's nothing personal.

01:17:34.205 --> 01:17:37.957
If you think about it, who am
the real villain here?

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:42.752
I got rid of executives
corrupt and I'm wrong?

01:17:42.753 --> 01:17:45.238
I made the world a better place.

01:17:45.239 --> 01:17:46.855
A head each time.

01:17:50.738 --> 01:17:53.167
Do you know? The plan for
Bloom was not

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.508
more complicated than normal.

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.164
Expect the executive bitch
enter the elevator

01:17:59.165 --> 01:18:02.060
depots pick her up
downstairs.

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:21.377
Then everything got complicated.

01:18:23.722 --> 01:18:26.527
Why are we stopping here?
Not the...

01:18:27.053 --> 01:18:28.966
And Redd had to ruin it

01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:32.124
by being in the same elevator.

01:18:47.985 --> 01:18:50.309
Sometimes you learn
to improvise.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.429
Escape was the easy part.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:16.150
You know, strangely we
Redd thank for many things.

01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:19.363
He introduced us to each other.

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:25.623
A shame that in cases
Work really work.

01:19:36.846 --> 01:19:38.303
Hands up!

01:19:38.304 --> 01:19:41.527
- Hands up!
- Get down!

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:43.303
Lie on the floor! Hands up!

01:19:43.304 --> 01:19:44.762
Lie down on the fucking ground!

01:19:44.763 --> 01:19:46.644
- Lower now!
- Lower now!

01:19:46.645 --> 01:19:49.604
- Lower!
- Lower now!

01:19:50.532 --> 01:19:53.116
Raise your hands and lay on the floor!

01:20:52.252 --> 01:20:54.248
The pressure is falling.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.903
Okay, I got this.

01:21:02.575 --> 01:21:04.908
- She lost consciousness.
- Good.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.106
- See what was back there?
- Yes, I have not seen.

01:21:11.107 --> 01:21:12.988
There were bodies everywhere.

01:21:14.039 --> 01:21:16.424
This excites you?

01:21:16.944 --> 01:21:22.520
No, but it makes me want
back to work.

01:22:37.805 --> 01:22:40.859
Annabelle. ready
for tonight?

01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:45.540
I must be the best
agent in the world.

01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:49.303
Everyone is me
looking, judging me...

01:22:49.304 --> 01:22:50.604
I'm not in the mood.

01:22:50.605 --> 01:22:53.377
Honey, is inconvenient.

01:22:53.378 --> 01:22:55.368
An hour will have to leave

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:57.840
his apartment
and face it.

01:22:57.841 --> 01:23:01.274
I know that. I'll call you later.

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:04.472
Straighten up. My way.

01:23:42.592 --> 01:23:43.893
Alright.

01:23:45.504 --> 01:23:51.446
You can do this
because it is a tough bitch.

01:23:58.631 --> 01:24:01.019
- Hello?
- I am, dear.

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.508
You can climb.

01:24:08.552 --> 01:24:10.615
- Hi
- Close the door.

01:24:10.616 --> 01:24:12.017
Close the fucking door.

01:24:12.018 --> 01:24:14.121
I'm sorry, honey.

01:24:19.551 --> 01:24:23.226
Look what you force me to do.

01:24:32.788 --> 01:24:34.423
Poor Annabelle.

01:24:35.286 --> 01:24:37.366
What a disappointment.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:44.837
I thought we
we understood.

01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:51.723
I really liked you.

01:24:52.266 --> 01:24:54.973
We would of mouth
closed, and then..

01:24:56.118 --> 01:24:59.651
Suddenly you write
damn book about us?

01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:18.171
What were you thinking?

01:25:19.978 --> 01:25:22.565
What happened to discretion?

01:25:23.578 --> 01:25:27.397
I packed a copy
their work

01:25:27.398 --> 01:25:30.223
in a very reluctant publisher.

01:25:35.686 --> 01:25:39.371
" Dr. Lansdale
transformed Redd.

01:25:39.372 --> 01:25:42.507
He created the boss from hell. "

01:25:43.748 --> 01:25:45.346
This is my favorite :

01:25:45.347 --> 01:25:48.044
" William, on the other hand, "

01:25:48.045 --> 01:25:50.584
was born a psychopath.

01:25:50.585 --> 01:25:53.763
" Arrogant and deluded. "

01:25:54.396 --> 01:25:57.151
Now, Annabelle,
do not know if you heard,

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.732
but there are many people who receam

01:25:59.733 --> 01:26:02.886
to believe in gibberish
a stripper.

01:26:02.887 --> 01:26:06.329
Then I'll do
one last favor.

01:26:08.355 --> 01:26:10.037
I'll kill her.

01:26:10.851 --> 01:26:12.572
Will wonder why you

01:26:12.573 --> 01:26:15.777
was not to launch
of his book,

01:26:15.778 --> 01:26:20.843
come to see her body
decapitated and summer,

01:26:20.844 --> 01:26:26.436
in fact, you were right!

01:26:30.965 --> 01:26:32.475
God!

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.889
Help!

01:27:04.915 --> 01:27:06.310
Help!

01:27:06.753 --> 01:27:09.764
Help! Help me!

01:27:18.445 --> 01:27:22.177
He's trying to kill me!
Help me...

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.467
Stay behind me.

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.613
Please do not.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.318
Stay away from me.

01:28:03.872 --> 01:28:06.242
Job well done,
Miss Hale.

01:28:06.545 --> 01:28:08.784
You need new shoes.

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:10.813
Meanwhile,

01:28:10.814 --> 01:28:14.642
have an urgent appointment
with Dr. Landsdale.

01:28:16.848 --> 01:28:18.621
Keep in touch.

01:28:49.186 --> 01:28:50.760
Here she is.

01:28:50.761 --> 01:28:54.980
The author, Annabelle Hale.

01:28:59.925 --> 01:29:02.361
I want you to know
William Tucker.

01:29:02.362 --> 01:29:04.893
The real Decapitator.

01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:08.450
So...

01:29:11.743 --> 01:29:13.606
Questions?
