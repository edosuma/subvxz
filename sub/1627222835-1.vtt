00:27.452 --> 00:30.589
The tragedy
of life is not death.

00:30.622 --> 00:33.358
For, there's honor in death.

00:35.393 --> 00:38.931
Tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

00:38.965 --> 00:39.832
while we live.

00:41.801 --> 00:44.536
This land has nurtured our
people for generations.

00:46.072 --> 00:47.539
This land is our mother.

00:48.741 --> 00:50.042
It has given us life.

00:51.376 --> 00:55.915
It has taught us to
walk, to grow, to hunt,

00:55.948 --> 00:57.482
to love, to fight,

00:58.617 --> 01:00.285
to live and to die.

01:01.386 --> 01:03.588
And when it was time to
pass from this world,

01:04.489 --> 01:09.461
this land cradled our bones
and absorbed our souls.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.801
So many of our dearly
departed are buried here,

01:15.835 --> 01:16.869
right under our feet.

01:19.504 --> 01:21.339
This was our pact with Mother
Earth,

01:22.141 --> 01:25.577
from one generation to the
next, for years and years,

01:27.512 --> 01:28.948
until until the white man came.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.584
He came to this land,

01:34.053 --> 01:36.688
a land vast enough to
accommodate many.

01:38.825 --> 01:40.793
He came with the promise of
friendship.

01:41.928 --> 01:43.796
He came with the promise of
peace.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.599
With this understanding,

01:47.632 --> 01:49.836
must one still welcomed the
uninvited.

01:54.073 --> 01:59.078
Time has passed and the land has
received

01:59.644 --> 02:02.014
many more of the uninvited.

02:03.648 --> 02:05.684
But what the visitors never
understood

02:06.886 --> 02:10.521
is that the bond between mother
and child is unbreakable,

02:11.623 --> 02:14.894
irrespective of the circumstances
of their separation,

02:16.595 --> 02:18.630
mother and child must be
together.

02:20.432 --> 02:24.136
Time has passed, yeah, but for
my people,

02:24.170 --> 02:26.105
time has also stood still.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.407
Listen closely.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.078
Can you hear it?

02:34.747 --> 02:36.115
The trees.

02:36.148 --> 02:38.084
The trees are calling.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.551
Mother Earth is calling

02:41.653 --> 02:44.991
It's time for her children
to come back home.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.273
Hey, how you feeling today?

05:47.306 --> 05:48.808
Not one of my best days.

05:48.841 --> 05:51.110
These medical bills really got
me worried.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.812
I know.

05:52.845 --> 05:53.645
I'm sorry.

05:53.678 --> 05:54.914
I hate that you worry about
that.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.018
You've done such a great
job taking care of me.

05:59.051 --> 06:01.353
Your parents would be so proud
of you.

06:01.387 --> 06:03.389
That means so much to me,
auntie.

06:03.422 --> 06:05.958
I really wish I got a
chance to get to know them.

06:06.959 --> 06:10.628
Hey, don't you be going and
saying goodbyes now, okay?

06:11.330 --> 06:12.731
Okay.

06:12.765 --> 06:14.233
I promise

06:14.266 --> 06:15.667
I'll get us through this.

06:17.403 --> 06:18.370
Okay?

06:18.404 --> 06:19.271
Okay.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.175
I'll be back tomorrow, Auntie.

06:23.209 --> 06:28.180
Okay.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.416
Hey, has anyone seen Ricky?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.085
Him and Laney went to take a
drive.

08:46.118 --> 08:48.254
They said they'd be right back.

08:48.287 --> 08:49.421
A drive, huh?

08:49.455 --> 08:50.356
I guess that's what they're
calling it

08:50.389 --> 08:51.857
after being apart for months.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.893
My big bro has this Firebird in
park

08:54.927 --> 08:56.095
and I bet all you guys

08:56.128 --> 08:57.930
he's with Laney in the back
seat.

08:58.831 --> 08:59.498
Oh my God.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.167
Guess that calls for another
beer.

09:20.919 --> 09:22.821
It's supposed to be right
here.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.457
Why is it so important to you?

09:25.491 --> 09:26.358
Goddammit!

09:28.060 --> 09:29.028
I said enough.

09:31.463 --> 09:34.033
You know this thing's
nothing but bad luck.

09:35.034 --> 09:37.503
Not sure why you want it so bad.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.305
Oh, technically it isn't for you
right?

09:39.338 --> 09:40.506
It's for those Indians

09:40.539 --> 09:43.208
at the casino on silver lake.

09:43.242 --> 09:43.876
Those damn Cherokees

09:43.909 --> 09:47.346
can't let sleeping dogs lie.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.548
I say, leave the past in the
past.

09:49.581 --> 09:50.916
What's done is done.

09:50.949 --> 09:52.284
What is it with these Indians

09:52.318 --> 09:53.919
and their Hocus Pocus bullshit?

09:53.952 --> 09:54.953
Am I right?

09:54.987 --> 09:56.622
Keep digging.

09:56.655 --> 09:58.324
I don't believe in that shit.

10:00.192 --> 10:02.461
Do you really think
the ring is, is cursed?

10:03.395 --> 10:05.097
Sorry, what's your name again?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.568
That was a hell of a rodeo,
cowboy.

10:09.601 --> 10:10.969
I missed you Laney.

10:11.003 --> 10:12.137
I missed you too.

10:13.038 --> 10:14.873
Best early Christmas present
ever.

10:16.041 --> 10:17.109
You like that?

10:17.142 --> 10:19.044
Just you wait until New Year's
Eve.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.458
Hey, where are you going?

10:32.491 --> 10:34.093
I gotta take a leak.

11:22.674 --> 11:23.542
Did I tell ya?

11:24.410 --> 11:25.644
What did I tell ya?

11:25.677 --> 11:27.012
Wait 'til you get a load of
this.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.414
It's a pretty sight.

11:30.716 --> 11:32.017
Where's the ring?

11:32.050 --> 11:34.286
Wait, that's impossible.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.355
Somebody must've taken it.

11:36.388 --> 11:37.723
Nobody saw me down here.

11:37.757 --> 11:39.458
Nobody knew I was down here.

11:41.627 --> 11:43.495
I don't see it anywhere.

11:43.529 --> 11:45.697
I swear it was in that box.

11:46.632 --> 11:47.666
I'll find it.

11:47.699 --> 11:50.035
I'll find it somehow.

11:50.068 --> 11:51.336
I know it's gonna be here.

11:54.306 --> 11:56.141
I know I fucked up, man, please.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.209
Come on, please.

11:57.242 --> 12:00.379
Gimme a chance, gimme a
chance to find it for you.

12:00.412 --> 12:01.246
No, please...

12:09.154 --> 12:10.022
Ricky!

12:11.089 --> 12:11.957
Ricky!

12:13.192 --> 12:14.059
Shit.

12:18.731 --> 12:22.401
Shit, Ricky, where the fuck are
you?

12:22.434 --> 12:23.302
Ricky.

12:30.743 --> 12:31.610
Goddammit!

12:33.045 --> 12:35.447
Ricky, where the fuck are you?

13:01.507 --> 13:03.108
Come on.

15:54.646 --> 15:56.448
Trish, you're counting, honey?

15:57.516 --> 15:59.351
Coming. I'm coming.

15:59.384 --> 16:01.386
Honey, we're gonna be
late.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.755
She's not coming back.

16:05.524 --> 16:06.358
No.

16:06.391 --> 16:07.259
Good.

16:09.762 --> 16:10.830
Good luck, Trish.

16:10.863 --> 16:11.964
Now you boys behave

16:11.998 --> 16:13.933
and don't do anything I wouldn't
do.

16:15.267 --> 16:18.871
Now, Chase, are you sure
you're going to be okay?

16:18.905 --> 16:19.739
Of course.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.673
Why wouldn't it be okay?

16:21.707 --> 16:23.341
It's a big place, John.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.911
It's a big responsibility.

16:24.944 --> 16:27.345
You guys, I'm gonna be fine.

16:27.379 --> 16:29.614
Just enjoy your weekend, okay?

16:29.648 --> 16:32.284
Yeah. Mr and Mrs.
Larson have a great time

16:32.317 --> 16:34.586
and I'll, I'll keep good...

16:34.619 --> 16:37.422
I'll keep close, close,
close eye on Chase.

16:38.423 --> 16:42.327
Chase, can I speak with
you privately for a minute?

16:44.296 --> 16:44.964
Scram.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.399
Now, listen son.

16:47.432 --> 16:48.633
Yeah, dad?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.003
I have no problem with your
friend here spending the night.

16:51.037 --> 16:52.237
His name is Javon.

16:52.905 --> 16:54.741
Right, Javon.

16:54.774 --> 16:57.375
But just remember you're
the one in charge.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.477
I know.

16:58.510 --> 16:59.511
No funny business.

16:59.544 --> 17:01.613
Make sure you lock up
everything before bed.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.448
And then of course, no parties.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.983
Who would I invite to a party?

17:05.017 --> 17:05.818
Javon's pretty much

17:05.852 --> 17:07.519
my entire social life at the
moment.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.387
No one goes into my private
study.

17:09.421 --> 17:13.358
Relax, I'm not gonna let
him in, it's off limits.

17:13.391 --> 17:14.259
Good.

17:15.393 --> 17:16.461
Yeah, have a good weekend.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:17.362 --> 17:20.365
Have a great time and Hey Mr.
Larson,

17:20.397 --> 17:21.733
don't worry about a thing.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.405
It is on bro.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.010
Party at Liberty Manor!

17:32.410 --> 17:33.246
Damn.

17:34.881 --> 17:37.349
How have you never invited me
here before?

17:38.416 --> 17:39.886
Oh, we should see if Adrianna
and Kayla

17:39.919 --> 17:41.353
wanna come up here.

17:43.655 --> 17:44.791
Yeah.

17:44.824 --> 17:47.760
So which way is your dad's study
anyway?

17:47.794 --> 17:50.328
Is that where he hides
all the good scotch?

17:50.362 --> 17:53.733
In case you haven't heard his
study is totally off limits.

17:53.766 --> 17:55.400
Why?

17:55.433 --> 17:58.603
it's his little museum to this
place?

17:58.637 --> 18:00.940
Liberty Manor was built on
some old Indian grounds.

18:00.973 --> 18:03.009
So he keeps all the artifacts in
there.

18:04.744 --> 18:06.344
That's fucking dope.

18:07.679 --> 18:10.348
Just remember, it's off
limits.

18:11.050 --> 18:13.085
My dad would ground me for like
a month.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.688
Ground you?

18:16.721 --> 18:17.824
Ground you?

18:17.857 --> 18:19.826
You're in college, homie.

18:19.859 --> 18:21.326
Man up.

18:23.528 --> 18:27.499
All right, so let me get this
straight.

18:27.532 --> 18:30.368
So it's you,

18:34.539 --> 18:35.908
your sister,

18:35.942 --> 18:37.576
your parents

18:37.609 --> 18:39.644
in this big ass house?

18:39.678 --> 18:40.880
Pretty much.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.815
We hire a few people
during the peak season,

18:42.849 --> 18:45.483
but the rest of the time, it's
just us.

18:45.517 --> 18:47.920
Oh, and Mr. Jenkins,
he's our groundskeeper.

18:47.954 --> 18:51.123
Or, was our groundskeeper.

18:51.157 --> 18:52.424
What happened to him?

18:52.457 --> 18:53.259
We had to fire him.

18:53.292 --> 18:55.393
He had a bad case of sticky
fingers.

18:56.561 --> 18:57.529
That sucks.

18:57.562 --> 19:00.933
Yeah, just leaves us
and the Indian ghosts.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.703
What, what, what?

19:04.737 --> 19:06.973
The Indian ghosts.

19:07.006 --> 19:09.574
You know, sometimes
you can hear him crying

19:09.608 --> 19:10.843
out in the woods at night.

19:12.945 --> 19:13.946
I'm just kidding.

19:15.081 --> 19:18.017
Truthfully, it just comes
down to what you believe.

19:18.050 --> 19:20.920
The developers of this estate
even found some remains

19:20.953 --> 19:24.489
of an old burial ground right
over there.

19:24.522 --> 19:25.224
Really?

19:25.258 --> 19:26.859
- Yeah.
- That's fucking dope.

19:27.894 --> 19:29.929
Not sure exactly what happened.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.564
Over the trees though, am I
right?

19:32.597 --> 19:34.699
Sometimes at night they tell the
story.

19:36.035 --> 19:38.971
Cool, cool man.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.773
Sweet, well, I'll, I'll tell
Eddie

19:40.806 --> 19:42.574
to bring you some peyote

19:42.607 --> 19:44.810
and we'll pay some respects.

19:44.844 --> 19:45.677
Pay respects?

19:45.710 --> 19:47.079
This is our land now.

19:48.748 --> 19:50.682
It's been in my family for
generations.

19:50.715 --> 19:52.617
Oh, well...

19:53.886 --> 19:55.922
Guess you're just gonna
have to smoke to that then.

19:57.056 --> 19:59.091
All right, let's get this
started here.

20:13.538 --> 20:15.741
Yo, this place is dope!

20:15.775 --> 20:18.510
Wow, this place is freaking
huge.

20:18.543 --> 20:19.779
Thank you.

20:19.812 --> 20:21.113
Where's the master?

20:21.147 --> 20:22.514
Oh, that's my parent's room.

20:22.547 --> 20:23.749
So, that one's gonna be off
limits.

20:23.783 --> 20:26.085
Oh geez, don't be such a goody
guide.

20:26.118 --> 20:28.520
Kayla, I'm sure there's
plenty of other rooms.

20:28.553 --> 20:29.188
Lay off.

20:29.221 --> 20:30.256
Fine.

20:30.289 --> 20:33.092
Do you want me to bring
you down the hall, Becky?

20:33.125 --> 20:33.960
Huh?

20:33.993 --> 20:34.526
I can show you to your
room?

20:34.559 --> 20:35.995
Yeah, thanks.

20:37.662 --> 20:40.066
Yo. how many rooms they got?

20:40.967 --> 20:42.667
I call dibs on this one.

20:43.836 --> 20:45.137
This thing is huge.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.075
Yo, this one's mine.

21:01.253 --> 21:02.922
Yeah?

21:02.955 --> 21:04.824
David, I want an update.

21:06.658 --> 21:09.561
Now, Mr. Jenkins didn't honor
his word.

21:09.594 --> 21:11.696
It's just a setback.

21:11.731 --> 21:13.766
Don't let it ruffle your head
dress.

21:13.799 --> 21:15.134
You better find it.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.634
Don't come back without it.

21:46.032 --> 21:47.565
Adrianna.

21:47.599 --> 21:48.267
Hey Chase.

21:49.902 --> 21:51.771
This house is amazing.

21:51.804 --> 21:53.873
Finally, now the party can
start.

21:53.906 --> 21:55.808
Let's go put your stuff
away and pour a drink.

21:55.841 --> 21:56.942
Sounds good to me,

21:56.976 --> 21:58.878
But chase, where's the master?

21:58.911 --> 22:00.678
Oh, it's all the way
down the hall to the left.

22:00.712 --> 22:01.347
I'll take you.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.248
Okay.

22:04.216 --> 22:06.718
And it's just
right around the corner.

22:35.381 --> 22:36.315
Here's the master.

22:36.348 --> 22:38.751
Awesome, this worked
perfect, thanks Chase.

22:52.697 --> 22:53.933
I'll be out in a minute, Chase.

22:53.966 --> 22:55.633
Oh, right, sorry.

23:48.287 --> 23:52.091
Yo, man, this party's off the
hook, dog.

23:52.124 --> 23:54.894
I dunno, you guys are
getting pretty loud.

23:54.927 --> 23:55.794
Hey boys.

23:57.029 --> 23:58.264
Hey girlfriend.

23:58.297 --> 23:59.932
Hello, Kayla.

23:59.965 --> 24:01.767
Well, hello, Mr. Larson.

24:03.369 --> 24:05.905
You need to loosen up a bit,
man.

24:05.938 --> 24:07.339
I am.

24:07.373 --> 24:08.440
Whatever, dog.

24:08.474 --> 24:12.745
You're as uptight as a
camel's ass in a sand storm.

24:12.778 --> 24:15.080
Wow, Chase, this place is
amazing.

24:15.114 --> 24:16.849
I just love the architecture.

24:16.882 --> 24:18.984
The ceiling is mahogany, right?

24:19.018 --> 24:20.119
I guess so.

24:21.754 --> 24:23.989
Great, what were you saying?

24:24.023 --> 24:25.357
One large pepperoni pizza.

24:25.391 --> 24:26.859
Is that cool with everybody?

24:26.892 --> 24:27.993
Hell yeah.

24:29.828 --> 24:31.964
So what do you want from me?

24:31.997 --> 24:36.435
I want you to have
fun at your own party.

24:39.405 --> 24:40.973
Javon, I don't think that's...

24:41.006 --> 24:42.441
Listen, look man, look, look.

24:43.776 --> 24:46.879
You gotta, you gotta talk
to the people, you know?

24:46.912 --> 24:47.846
Look at that vibe.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.383
Socialize, mingle, you know?

24:53.018 --> 24:56.155
Have you said anything to anyone
today?

24:57.089 --> 24:58.324
That's what I'm saying.

24:59.558 --> 25:00.725
What do you think I should do?

25:03.963 --> 25:05.097
Excuse me, excuse me.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.865
Can I get everybody's attention
please?

25:06.899 --> 25:08.267
Real quick, right up here, yo!

25:08.300 --> 25:10.236
Can I just get a quick round
of applause for my man,

25:10.269 --> 25:12.504
Chase Larson for opening up his
house

25:12.538 --> 25:14.039
and for throwing this little
shindig.

25:14.073 --> 25:15.174
Give it up for him, y'all.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.012
Now, I bet a lot of you didn't
notice,

25:20.045 --> 25:23.249
but my man Chase, he's a mad
Magician.

25:23.282 --> 25:25.384
Yeah, nah, shut up, I got you.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.353
Yeah, his routine is dope.

25:27.386 --> 25:28.921
Yeah, he could do anything.

25:29.822 --> 25:31.090
And I mean anything.

25:32.224 --> 25:35.227
Yo, Magic Man, make
Kayla's bra disappear.

25:36.195 --> 25:38.063
You wish.

25:38.097 --> 25:40.099
All right, all right, settle
down, y'all, settle down.

25:40.132 --> 25:44.503
Now, I'm about to introduce
the magician on a mission.

25:44.536 --> 25:47.406
The one and only, Chase Larson.

25:47.439 --> 25:49.074
Give it up for Chase.

25:49.108 --> 25:50.209
Yo, come on man.

25:50.242 --> 25:51.443
Come on, y'all show him some
love guys.

25:51.477 --> 25:52.111
Show him some love.

25:52.144 --> 25:54.146
Come on man, let's go, dog.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.382
Show the people something, man.

25:56.415 --> 25:57.349
Let's go.

25:57.383 --> 26:00.286
Yeah, show him some love, come
on, y'all.

26:00.319 --> 26:01.987
Cheer him on, yeah!

26:02.021 --> 26:04.890
You got this man, you got this,
dog.

26:04.923 --> 26:05.824
Show me some love.

26:12.131 --> 26:14.033
Good evening, my friends.

26:14.066 --> 26:16.935
I really only have one
question for you tonight.

26:17.636 --> 26:19.471
Do you believe in magic?

26:21.407 --> 26:23.876
Magic is no laughing matter.

26:23.909 --> 26:25.978
The land you're on right now,

26:26.011 --> 26:28.480
the earth beneath your feet,

26:28.514 --> 26:31.517
the Liberty Manor Estate
resides on hallowed ground.

26:32.451 --> 26:34.053
It belonged to an ancient Indian
tribe

26:34.086 --> 26:35.854
that believed in magic.

26:35.888 --> 26:38.023
They believed in the spirit
gods,

26:38.057 --> 26:40.893
that they used magic to rule
the heavens and the earth.

26:40.926 --> 26:43.996
That magic could turn life into
death

26:44.029 --> 26:46.899
as easily as it could turn day
into night.

26:46.932 --> 26:47.966
Oh, shit.

26:52.004 --> 26:53.105
The Indians also believed

26:53.138 --> 26:55.341
that every soul is a light

26:59.011 --> 27:01.380
and that light will only
continue to burn

27:01.413 --> 27:04.950
as long as you believed
in the power of magic

27:04.983 --> 27:08.620
for belief in magic is a
belief in the sanctity of life.

27:19.098 --> 27:23.435
But if you don't believe in
magic and you lose faith,

27:24.470 --> 27:27.473
well, it's only a matter
of time before the light

27:27.506 --> 27:32.311
in your soul begins to burn up.

27:38.984 --> 27:41.120
That's my boy, I know him, I
know him.

27:41.153 --> 27:41.821
Get over here, man.

27:41.855 --> 27:43.489
That was as cool as football.

27:43.522 --> 27:44.390
Thank you.

27:44.423 --> 27:48.394
Dude, bro, great job.

27:48.427 --> 27:49.395
Thank you.

27:49.428 --> 27:50.062
Great job.

27:52.464 --> 27:55.100
Now it time to get some pussy.

28:00.205 --> 28:03.075
Okay, Chase, we get
it.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.344
All right, Magic
Man, lights back on please.

28:06.445 --> 28:07.446
Watch out guys, what
was that?

28:07.479 --> 28:08.614
Oh my God,
there's something outside.

28:08.647 --> 28:10.115
Dude, what the fuck?

28:10.149 --> 28:11.150
Did you see that?

28:11.183 --> 28:12.451
Yeah, what was that?

28:12.484 --> 28:13.452
Chase, this isn't
like,

28:13.485 --> 28:15.320
this isn't cool anymore
dude, like seriously.

28:15.354 --> 28:16.455
Yeah, Chase come on.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.556
Kinda scared.

28:18.657 --> 28:20.225
I didn't do that.

28:23.061 --> 28:25.230
Chase, like that was really
not funny.

28:25.264 --> 28:26.365
Yeah, not cool.

28:27.366 --> 28:28.634
Javon, that wasn't me.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.536
I didn't turn them off.

28:30.569 --> 28:32.538
Whatever man, you're
tripping.

28:34.306 --> 28:35.707
Wow, will you look at this?

28:37.509 --> 28:38.477
What?

28:38.510 --> 28:41.280
Well, according to this map,

28:41.313 --> 28:44.416
not only was the manor
built on Indian property,

28:44.450 --> 28:48.187
but right on top of an
Indian burial ground.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.221
So what?

28:49.254 --> 28:50.088
So what?

28:50.122 --> 28:52.191
You don't find that the least
bit odd?

28:52.224 --> 28:54.326
That out of all the property

28:54.359 --> 28:56.061
that they could have built this
manor on,

28:56.094 --> 28:59.531
they built it smack on top of a
graveyard.

28:59.565 --> 29:01.200
Okay, that's creepy.

29:01.233 --> 29:03.235
That's disrespectful is what
that is.

29:03.268 --> 29:04.536
They did it on purpose.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.404
What?

29:05.437 --> 29:06.605
Why would they do that?

29:06.638 --> 29:08.540
To show the Indians that
they're no longer wanted here.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.142
That they no longer matter.

29:10.175 --> 29:11.610
Damn straight.

29:11.643 --> 29:12.611
Eddie.

29:12.644 --> 29:13.679
What?

29:13.712 --> 29:14.747
It's the truth ain't it?

29:14.781 --> 29:16.749
It's just like football.

29:16.783 --> 29:20.118
You don't wanna just win,
you wanna destroy them.

29:20.152 --> 29:21.553
You wanna embarrass them.

29:21.587 --> 29:24.189
That way they never want a
rematch.

29:24.223 --> 29:25.758
And this is why we broke up.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.392
It's the law of the jungle.

29:27.426 --> 29:30.262
Kill or be killed.

29:30.295 --> 29:31.597
God, you're such an asshole.

29:31.630 --> 29:32.732
What?

29:32.765 --> 29:34.600
Yeah, I wouldn't say
you're like a full on asshole

29:34.633 --> 29:37.102
but you're kind of an asshole.

29:37.135 --> 29:39.438
Yeah, you are, you are.

29:39.471 --> 29:40.606
What'd I do?

29:41.573 --> 29:43.642
I'm not the one who turned the
lights off.

29:54.854 --> 29:56.655
Oh, whoa, yo, check this out.

29:56.688 --> 29:58.390
Hey, Javon.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.792
Yo.

29:59.826 --> 30:00.793
Yo.

30:00.827 --> 30:03.595
Yo, guys, look at this,
this is dope as hell.

30:03.629 --> 30:06.231
Javon, we really
shouldn't be in this room.

30:06.265 --> 30:07.366
Yeah, now I know why.

30:07.399 --> 30:08.835
Yo, guys come in here.

30:08.868 --> 30:09.802
Look at this.

30:09.836 --> 30:12.504
Wow, this room is incredible.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.541
Man, this shit is
tight.

30:15.574 --> 30:17.709
Everyone, we really
need to get outta here.

30:17.744 --> 30:19.244
This room is off limits.

30:19.278 --> 30:21.014
Guys, take a look at this
ring.

30:23.148 --> 30:24.349
So unbelievable.

30:24.383 --> 30:27.152
Such a rich history this culture
has.

30:27.185 --> 30:30.857
Yeah and this is all that's
left of it.

30:30.890 --> 30:31.991
Listen to this.

30:32.025 --> 30:34.626
Apparently that ring belonged
to an Indian princess

30:34.660 --> 30:35.627
named Aiyana.

30:36.896 --> 30:38.263
Who gave it to her?

30:38.297 --> 30:39.766
Well, according to this, a
white man

30:39.799 --> 30:40.900
named Samuel Cook.

30:40.934 --> 30:43.669
He was a union soldier and
he wanted to marry Aiyana.

30:44.536 --> 30:45.738
That's really romantic.

30:46.773 --> 30:48.775
Not everybody thought so.

30:48.808 --> 30:51.143
Her father, Chief Dohate,

30:51.176 --> 30:54.479
he forbade the union
saying that the marriage

30:54.513 --> 30:56.415
would bring great shame to his
people.

30:57.449 --> 30:58.751
Aiyana married him
anyways?

30:58.785 --> 31:00.185
She did.

31:00.853 --> 31:02.889
And her father Chief Dohate

31:02.922 --> 31:05.557
in return declared war on the
locals.

31:05.591 --> 31:08.193
War on the locals, what
does that really even mean?

31:08.226 --> 31:11.731
Well, he cut off Cook's head

31:11.764 --> 31:14.132
and then he scalped several
other soldiers

31:14.166 --> 31:15.735
and then killed his own
daughter.

31:15.768 --> 31:19.772
Cut off her hand and
claimed the ring as his own.

31:19.806 --> 31:21.607
That's horrible.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.442
It doesn't end there either.

31:23.475 --> 31:25.344
A lot more of the tribe
was killed after that

31:25.377 --> 31:27.346
by the white men in retaliation,

31:27.379 --> 31:28.614
they had overwhelming firepower.

31:28.647 --> 31:29.481
What was that?

31:29.514 --> 31:30.349
Did you see that?

31:30.382 --> 31:32.551
Something just moved outside the
window.

31:32.584 --> 31:34.720
Ooh, someones scared.

31:34.754 --> 31:36.455
Relax, Kayla, there's nobody
out there.

31:36.488 --> 31:38.624
Anyway, Chief Dohate was
captured

31:38.657 --> 31:41.259
and brought before a
council of union soldiers.

31:41.293 --> 31:42.729
He was charged with the
incitement

31:42.762 --> 31:44.529
of many people in mass murder.

31:44.563 --> 31:47.366
He was hung right here on this
very site.

31:47.399 --> 31:49.334
With the noose fitted around his
neck,

31:49.368 --> 31:51.303
he muttered some words
in an ancient dialect

31:51.336 --> 31:54.272
that apparently cast an
eternal curse on that ring

31:54.306 --> 31:56.541
and all of those who
inhabit this sacred land.

31:57.777 --> 31:58.577
You don't actually believe

31:58.610 --> 32:00.712
this ring is a curse though, do
you?

32:00.747 --> 32:04.182
Well, he was hung on this very
spot

32:05.350 --> 32:08.253
and according to legend his
ghost

32:08.286 --> 32:09.521
and the ghosts of all the
slaughtered

32:09.554 --> 32:11.256
still haunt these very woods.

32:12.391 --> 32:13.258
It's true.

32:14.226 --> 32:15.527
What's true?

32:15.560 --> 32:17.195
It's true.

32:17.229 --> 32:19.464
Sometimes if you're very quiet,

32:20.733 --> 32:24.236
you can hear the noises of
the woods penetrate the night.

32:25.237 --> 32:26.405
It's probably just the wind

32:26.438 --> 32:31.443
but sometimes it really sounds
like an Indian drum beat.

32:31.878 --> 32:34.379
Soft and low.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.882
It's kind of creepy.

32:37.683 --> 32:39.317
Chief Dohate on the warpath.

32:44.356 --> 32:45.792
All right.

32:45.825 --> 32:49.594
Let's just, let's take a break
from the stories right now.

32:49.628 --> 32:51.663
How about we have some pizza,
right?

32:51.697 --> 32:52.631
Let's have some pizza.

32:52.664 --> 32:53.565
Yeah, yeah.

32:53.598 --> 32:54.599
Yeah.

32:54.633 --> 32:56.736
Let's do that, all right.

32:58.838 --> 33:01.239
Fucking hell, what the
fuck?

33:17.056 --> 33:19.558
Chase, are you checking me
out?

33:20.492 --> 33:21.326
What?

33:21.359 --> 33:22.962
No, no way.

33:23.896 --> 33:26.531
It's okay, it happens all the
time.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.746
All right guys, I think
I'm gonna go check on Eddie

33:39.779 --> 33:42.647
and make sure he didn't
set the forest on fire?

33:42.681 --> 33:43.750
You want me to go with you?

33:43.783 --> 33:44.851
That's okay.

33:44.884 --> 33:46.052
I think you should stay
here and work on your game.

33:46.085 --> 33:47.719
You know what I mean.

33:57.662 --> 34:00.532
I think I'm gonna make sure
Adrianna doesn't get lost.

34:00.565 --> 34:01.399
Bye boys.

34:01.433 --> 34:02.300
See ya.

34:04.036 --> 34:05.637
Did you see that?

34:06.538 --> 34:07.305
Adrianna?

34:07.339 --> 34:09.407
See me make a total ass of
myself?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.844
You totally did not
pick up on the clues, man.

34:11.878 --> 34:12.844
She's into you.

34:12.879 --> 34:14.545
Really?

34:14.579 --> 34:17.616
Are you both clueless
like, like that clueless?

34:17.649 --> 34:19.583
Adrianna just likes taunting you
guys.

34:20.753 --> 34:22.755
You don't know anything,
Becky.

34:22.789 --> 34:23.822
Oh really?

34:23.856 --> 34:24.956
Take a look around.

34:24.991 --> 34:26.993
Where are the other girls right
now?

34:27.025 --> 34:28.493
They're both with Eddie.

34:28.527 --> 34:30.062
It doesn't take a genius
to pick up on the,

34:30.096 --> 34:31.931
what did you just call them,
Javon?

34:31.964 --> 34:32.831
Clues?

34:38.603 --> 34:42.407
♪ Come on baby light my fire ♪

34:42.440 --> 34:46.610
♪ Come on baby light my fire ♪

34:46.645 --> 34:51.349
♪ Come on baby light my fire ♪

34:51.382 --> 34:54.987
♪ Come on baby light my fire ♪

34:56.889 --> 34:57.990
Oh wait, wrong song.

34:58.024 --> 35:01.761
♪ Come on baby light my ♪

35:01.794 --> 35:04.663
♪ Adrianna light my fire ♪

35:04.696 --> 35:05.865
Oh, good one, park boy.

35:05.898 --> 35:07.066
♪ Adrianna ♪

35:07.099 --> 35:08.400
You really wanna light my fire.

35:08.433 --> 35:09.068
Oh really, is that your thing?

35:09.101 --> 35:09.936
Yeah.

35:09.969 --> 35:11.570
Yeah?

35:11.603 --> 35:12.939
You look beautiful tonight.

35:12.972 --> 35:13.806
Thank you.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.706
As always.

35:18.044 --> 35:20.046
Okay, all right, buddy, easy.

35:20.079 --> 35:20.913
Why?

35:20.947 --> 35:21.881
You're drunk.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.548
No, I'm just having fun.

35:23.582 --> 35:24.416
Yeah?

35:24.449 --> 35:25.084
You're always having fun.

35:25.117 --> 35:26.152
That's the life.

35:26.185 --> 35:27.019
I know.

36:42.694 --> 36:45.497
Come on, baby, it's almost
Christmas.

36:45.530 --> 36:46.999
Why don't you come sit on
Santa's lap?

36:47.033 --> 36:49.001
Come on, get off of me.

36:50.236 --> 36:54.639
Look, I built this beautiful
romantic fire just for you.

36:54.673 --> 36:55.640
Oh yeah?

36:55.674 --> 36:57.076
Yeah.

36:57.109 --> 37:01.113
I also got this sweet peyote
right here.

37:01.147 --> 37:02.514
Peyote?

37:02.547 --> 37:04.649
Yeah, babe, Indian ganja.

37:06.718 --> 37:07.619
Did you hear that?

37:09.188 --> 37:10.022
Hear what?

37:14.260 --> 37:16.862
Either this Peyote is talking
to me

37:16.896 --> 37:19.765
or this place is really haunted.

37:19.799 --> 37:21.801
Here, take a hit.

37:21.834 --> 37:22.835
All right.

37:29.108 --> 37:31.043
Gotta try, baby.

37:31.077 --> 37:33.012
Breathe it in.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.982
We gotta honor this land

37:37.883 --> 37:39.617
and break the Indian chief's
curse.

37:39.651 --> 37:41.854
Oh yeah, and how do we do
that?

37:42.955 --> 37:45.257
We have to show Chief Dohate

37:46.158 --> 37:48.693
that no matter how hard you try,

37:48.728 --> 37:50.863
you can't stop real love.

37:50.896 --> 37:51.731
Love, Eddie?

37:51.764 --> 37:53.531
Did you just say love?

37:53.565 --> 37:55.201
Yeah, baby, love.

37:55.234 --> 37:56.402
Yeah?

37:56.435 --> 37:58.738
The Dohate's of the world
can keep those stupid rings.

38:01.173 --> 38:03.009
If that ring was here right now

38:03.042 --> 38:04.877
I would take it and shove it
straight up

38:04.910 --> 38:06.578
his Indian ass

38:06.611 --> 38:10.515
because there's nobody that
can tell me who I can't love.

38:11.984 --> 38:13.986
Adrianna, I missed you so much.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.521
Yeah, Eddie, that ship has
sailed.

38:18.824 --> 38:20.760
Is this because of spring
break?

38:20.793 --> 38:23.329
Are you really still mad about
that?

38:23.362 --> 38:26.298
It was just some random
hookup, it meant nothing.

38:26.332 --> 38:28.300
Yeah, but it did to me, you
meathead?

38:29.634 --> 38:31.237
It was Cancun, babe.

38:31.270 --> 38:34.606
Come on, that's practically
another country.

38:34.639 --> 38:36.909
Okay, so then how
about that skank, Sheree,

38:36.942 --> 38:39.979
from Hooters, you know,
a little closer to home?

38:40.012 --> 38:40.946
What?

38:43.149 --> 38:44.884
Yeah, you didn't think
I knew about that one,

38:44.917 --> 38:45.785
now did you?

38:46.618 --> 38:50.156
Adrianna, we both know that
you

38:50.189 --> 38:52.892
are the only one that I care
about.

38:52.925 --> 38:54.193
You know, Eddie, the truth is

38:54.226 --> 38:57.063
you only care about yourself
and you always have.

38:58.030 --> 39:02.101
You had your chance and you blew
it.

39:06.739 --> 39:09.607
And that speech about love, real
touching.

39:19.185 --> 39:20.585
What a bitch.

39:22.321 --> 39:25.157
Hey, Eddie, you okay?

39:26.192 --> 39:29.895
Yeah, your friend can be a
real bitch sometimes though.

39:29.929 --> 39:31.964
Adrianna's okay.

39:31.997 --> 39:37.069
She just doesn't know how to
handle a real man, but I do.

39:37.103 --> 39:37.970
Oh yeah?

39:49.181 --> 39:51.616
Fucking unbelievable.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.121
Adrianna!

40:16.108 --> 40:17.743
To me, myself and I.

42:49.495 --> 42:50.362
Hello?

42:56.635 --> 42:59.371
Babe, listen, I'm really
sorry.

42:59.405 --> 43:01.273
I'm gonna make this up to you.

43:01.307 --> 43:03.542
Going after good girls now,
huh?

43:03.575 --> 43:05.144
Listen, she came onto me.

43:05.177 --> 43:06.011
Oh yeah?

43:06.045 --> 43:09.248
You know you're the only girl
I want.

43:12.651 --> 43:16.488
Poor guy, Eddie, messing up
every chance he gets, right?

43:16.522 --> 43:18.490
You're really gonna
leave me just like this?

43:18.524 --> 43:20.392
You've had one too many
chances.

43:22.428 --> 43:24.997
Wait, you're just gonna keep
the ring?

43:27.333 --> 43:29.335
Eddie, something is
seriously going on here.

43:29.368 --> 43:31.036
What are you talking about?

43:31.070 --> 43:33.405
I have taken this ring
off my hand multiple times

43:33.439 --> 43:36.408
and it just keeps ending up
right back in the same spot.

43:37.343 --> 43:38.177
That's impossible.

43:38.210 --> 43:39.044
No, I am serious.

43:39.078 --> 43:41.146
Something is seriously going on
here.

43:42.915 --> 43:43.582
Fine.

43:46.919 --> 43:49.088
Let's find out, let's test it.

44:00.232 --> 44:02.368
Yo, let's go to that bonfire

44:02.401 --> 44:04.636
and smoke some of that Peyote.

44:04.670 --> 44:06.572
Nah, you guys go ahead.

44:06.605 --> 44:08.207
What?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.908
I'm gonna just work on my game
over here

44:09.942 --> 44:11.176
for a little while.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.613
Get your ass outside when
you're done?

44:14.646 --> 44:16.648
In a little bit.

44:16.682 --> 44:18.584
Did you hear anything I just
said?

44:18.617 --> 44:20.919
Yeah, I heard everything you
just said.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.588
I'm gonna work on my game right
now.

44:24.089 --> 44:27.192
This, this ain't the game
you should be working on.

44:27.226 --> 44:28.427
Very funny.

44:29.962 --> 44:32.231
Why do I even try so hard with
him?

44:32.264 --> 44:33.132
Let's go, Becky.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.982
See, nothing.

45:25.651 --> 45:28.287
I'm gonna to take this
ring back to the study.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.956
These stories are just
going straight to your head.

45:46.205 --> 45:48.240
Where is everybody?

45:48.273 --> 45:50.676
Maybe they went off
exploring the property.

45:50.709 --> 45:52.544
This place is huge after all.

45:52.578 --> 45:55.147
Yeah, we have several acres.

45:55.180 --> 45:57.449
Oh, they might be at the
tennis courts around back.

45:57.483 --> 46:00.185
Wait, wait, hold the fuck up.

46:00.219 --> 46:04.122
You got a bowling alley and
tennis courts?

46:04.156 --> 46:05.524
Yeah, I'll show you.

46:05.557 --> 46:07.226
They probably headed over there.

46:09.628 --> 46:11.263
Are you coming?

46:11.296 --> 46:12.698
I'll meet you guys.

46:24.209 --> 46:25.711
Excuse me?

46:25.745 --> 46:26.779
Hello?

46:26.813 --> 46:28.347
Can I help you?

46:28.380 --> 46:30.315
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
disturb you.

46:30.349 --> 46:31.650
I didn't know there was anybody
here.

46:31.683 --> 46:33.820
Okay, well, it's my job to be
here.

46:33.853 --> 46:35.687
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

46:35.721 --> 46:37.122
May I ask who you are?

46:37.155 --> 46:38.357
May I ask who you are

46:38.390 --> 46:40.225
and what exactly are you doing
in my room

46:40.259 --> 46:42.160
and on this property?

46:42.194 --> 46:43.695
Well, like I said, I, I didn't
know.

46:43.730 --> 46:45.798
there was anybody here and
I'm a friend of Chase's.

46:45.832 --> 46:46.766
Oh yeah, okay.

46:46.799 --> 46:49.501
Well, Chase is not allowed to
have guests.

46:49.535 --> 46:50.770
Oh.

46:50.803 --> 46:53.305
Really, I didn't know that, I'm
sorry.

46:53.338 --> 46:54.273
Yes.

46:54.306 --> 46:57.142
So, earlier today I saw all of
you arrive.

46:57.175 --> 46:58.577
And I'll have, you know,
the Larson's hired me

46:58.610 --> 47:00.747
to be the new groundskeeper.

47:00.780 --> 47:02.849
Oh, okay.

47:02.882 --> 47:04.817
What exactly are you doing
with this?

47:04.851 --> 47:07.185
Are you doing some type of
research on the property?

47:07.219 --> 47:09.254
I'm just reading about it,
that's all.

47:09.288 --> 47:11.423
Well, you need to know that
this home

47:11.456 --> 47:14.393
was built on sacred tribal
burial grounds.

47:14.426 --> 47:15.762
Well, I did read something
about that,

47:15.795 --> 47:18.530
but where exactly was the burial
ground?

47:19.598 --> 47:21.266
Right here!

47:21.300 --> 47:22.434
You're standing on it.

47:23.569 --> 47:25.103
They built right on top of it?

47:25.137 --> 47:26.371
Yes, that is right.

47:26.405 --> 47:27.539
Of course they did.

47:27.573 --> 47:32.144
For many years, this family
has harmed and humiliated

47:32.177 --> 47:34.546
the heritage of the native
Americans that belong here.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.448
And one day they're going to
pay!

47:39.284 --> 47:40.853
What is that?

47:40.887 --> 47:42.521
What exactly is that, what did
you do?

47:42.554 --> 47:43.355
Who's out there?

47:43.388 --> 47:44.690
We didn't do anything, I don't
know

47:44.723 --> 47:47.693
We didn't do anything, I don't
know.

48:10.883 --> 48:11.851
Good evening.

48:11.884 --> 48:14.152
Is there something I can
help you with, Officer?

48:14.186 --> 48:15.487
Well, the Larson's asked me to
come here

48:15.520 --> 48:16.688
and check on Chase.

48:16.722 --> 48:17.689
Is he here?

48:17.723 --> 48:20.292
Well, he probably is
around here somewhere.

48:20.325 --> 48:21.593
I can, I can go look for him.

48:21.627 --> 48:24.463
By the way, Mr. Greene,
the new grounds keeper.

48:24.496 --> 48:25.932
Oh, there's a new grounds
keeper?

48:25.965 --> 48:27.100
Oh yeah.

48:27.132 --> 48:29.668
I didn't realize they had
anybody since Mr. Jenkins.

48:29.701 --> 48:30.569
Oh yeah.

48:31.670 --> 48:34.339
I think he's at the tennis
courts, I can get him.

48:34.373 --> 48:36.708
No that's okay, thanks anyway.

48:36.743 --> 48:38.878
I can see Mr. Greene has
everything under control here.

48:38.911 --> 48:40.278
You guys have a good night.

48:40.312 --> 48:41.413
Yeah, I do.

48:41.446 --> 48:43.916
I'm gonna get going too, yeah.

48:43.950 --> 48:44.616
You kid's behave.

48:44.650 --> 48:46.652
Yeah, okay, we will, we will.

49:08.908 --> 49:10.242
Oh, wow.

49:12.244 --> 49:13.445
Put this back.

49:15.347 --> 49:17.182
Oh, no way!

49:19.018 --> 49:21.253
I always wanted to try one of
these on.

49:24.656 --> 49:27.459
Oh goodness, I need a weapon.

49:28.928 --> 49:32.698
Oh, look at this.

49:41.273 --> 49:43.575
Eddie's on a war path.

49:48.346 --> 49:49.514
Oh, gosh.

49:54.821 --> 49:58.256
What's so special about
this damn ring anyways?

49:59.391 --> 50:03.830
I'm Chief Dohate and I curse
this ring.

50:03.863 --> 50:04.997
Anybody that touches it

50:05.031 --> 50:07.532
and I'll cut your damn hand off.

50:12.038 --> 50:13.338
Who was that?

50:14.907 --> 50:17.009
Yo, Chase, was that you?

50:17.043 --> 50:18.845
Yo, Chase.

50:18.878 --> 50:20.612
Man, where is everybody?

50:34.761 --> 50:38.330
Dude, this place creeps
me the fuck out, bro.

50:38.363 --> 50:39.866
I told you, you can hear the
crying

50:39.899 --> 50:41.366
out in the woods sometimes.

50:51.911 --> 50:53.712
Dude, cut it out.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.714
I'm trying
to get the lights back.

51:18.370 --> 51:19.906
Javon, are you okay?

51:23.575 --> 51:24.442
Yeah.

51:25.978 --> 51:26.846
Yeah.

51:28.047 --> 51:29.816
Let's get the fuck out of here,
man.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.130
Hey dudes!

51:44.163 --> 51:46.398
Get your asses over here.

51:46.431 --> 51:48.333
This peyote's not gonna smoke
itself.

52:06.484 --> 52:09.822
Yo, can I please have some of
that?

52:09.856 --> 52:10.655
Of course, bro.

52:10.689 --> 52:12.657
Yo, this place is freaking me
out.

52:12.691 --> 52:15.660
Eddie, where are Adrianna and
Kayla?

52:15.694 --> 52:17.129
We thought they were with you.

52:17.163 --> 52:19.031
They were with me earlier.

52:19.065 --> 52:20.099
You know what I mean?

52:21.700 --> 52:22.667
Such a gentlemen.

52:23.970 --> 52:26.105
Hey, have you guys been Kayla?

52:26.138 --> 52:27.740
I can't find her anywhere.

52:27.773 --> 52:28.640
No.

52:29.842 --> 52:32.044
I didn't think you'd be
wanting to see her for a while.

52:32.078 --> 52:33.145
Okay, asshole.

52:34.814 --> 52:37.449
She's drunk and have you
actually her.

52:38.217 --> 52:40.019
Maybe she's with Becky
somewhere.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.154
No, she's not with me,

52:42.188 --> 52:45.157
but you know, I gotta go
decompress, so

52:46.092 --> 52:47.793
I'll look for her while I'm
gone.

52:49.095 --> 52:49.962
Okay.

52:51.964 --> 52:54.166
Ooh, beer, beer?

52:54.200 --> 52:55.034
Yes.

52:55.067 --> 52:56.102
Yes.

52:56.135 --> 52:56.936
Gotcha.

52:56.969 --> 52:58.703
You don't need to worry about
me.

52:58.738 --> 52:59.638
Yes, leave this here.

53:01.207 --> 53:04.010
Do you think she went
to the tennis court?

53:04.043 --> 53:05.978
I truthfully don't know.

53:06.012 --> 53:08.680
When did you see her last?

53:08.713 --> 53:10.016
I mean, it's been a while.

53:11.150 --> 53:13.451
When we were
in the bowling alley.

53:13.485 --> 53:15.121
I haven't seen her
since she was with me.

54:00.166 --> 54:04.971
You never know when
the devil can come calling.

55:00.326 --> 55:01.193
Javon.

55:08.267 --> 55:10.202
Where the hell are you?

55:26.786 --> 55:29.021
So Chase, what's your
favorite type of magic?

55:29.055 --> 55:30.923
Well, my favorite type is card
magic.

55:30.956 --> 55:34.692
But specialty is making
things appear and disappear.

55:35.361 --> 55:37.096
How did you do that?

55:37.129 --> 55:38.330
Let's try something a little
bit harder.

55:38.364 --> 55:39.198
Okay.

55:39.231 --> 55:40.199
So, now you can see

55:40.232 --> 55:41.867
we've got a lot of
different options, right?

55:41.901 --> 55:43.135
A lot of different options.

55:43.169 --> 55:44.236
Uh, huh?

55:44.270 --> 55:47.807
So, I'm gonna have you
pick out two instead of one.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.808
I'm gonna have you pick out two.

55:48.841 --> 55:49.875
Okay.

55:49.909 --> 55:51.877
All I want you to do is
just hold up one finger.

55:51.911 --> 55:52.745
Okay.

55:52.778 --> 55:53.245
You can just drop it down on any
card.

55:53.279 --> 55:54.280
Sure.

55:54.313 --> 55:55.281
Got it, okay.

55:55.314 --> 55:56.882
Take that one and take
the one next to it too.

55:56.916 --> 55:58.317
Okay, do you wanna
see it?

55:58.350 --> 56:00.252
Sure, which ones do you have?

56:00.286 --> 56:03.389
So, four of diamonds and 7 of
clubs.

56:03.422 --> 56:05.825
Four diamonds and a seven of
clubs.

56:05.858 --> 56:09.361
Now these two cards,
could I use your sleeve?

56:09.395 --> 56:10.262
Sure.

56:11.163 --> 56:12.131
Okay, like that, perfect.

56:12.164 --> 56:12.832
I'm gonna take these two,

56:12.865 --> 56:16.035
and put them right inside there.

56:16.068 --> 56:17.303
Okay.

56:17.336 --> 56:18.838
Okay, now with your other
hand,

56:18.871 --> 56:21.340
can you take out one and
leave the other one inside?

56:24.110 --> 56:25.311
Let's see which one you got?

56:25.344 --> 56:26.178
Four of diamonds.

56:26.212 --> 56:27.980
Four of diamonds.

56:28.013 --> 56:28.646
So what was the other one?

56:28.680 --> 56:29.714
Seven of clubs.

56:29.748 --> 56:30.850
Seven of clubs.

56:30.883 --> 56:32.184
Watch the four diamonds.

56:32.218 --> 56:35.054
One, two, three.

56:36.222 --> 56:37.389
Looks like the seven of clubs.

56:37.423 --> 56:38.257
What?

56:38.290 --> 56:40.159
Did you just switch those?

56:40.192 --> 56:41.060
Check inside.

56:43.062 --> 56:44.997
Okay, that's
insane.

56:45.030 --> 56:46.298
Seriously.

56:46.332 --> 56:47.665
But that's not my specialty.

56:47.699 --> 56:48.334
Okay?

56:48.367 --> 56:49.235
I said that my specialty

56:49.268 --> 56:52.905
was making things appear and
disappear.

56:52.938 --> 56:55.074
Watch this seven of
clubs, it just disappears.

56:55.107 --> 56:55.941
Like that.

56:55.975 --> 56:57.243
Seven to clubs is gone.

56:57.276 --> 56:57.943
Oh my God.

56:57.977 --> 56:59.812
Not just the seven of clubs.

57:00.479 --> 57:04.750
Also, the entire deck has
disappeared.

57:04.783 --> 57:06.718
All right, that was seriously
amazing.

57:06.752 --> 57:08.287
I don't understand how
you did any of that.

57:08.320 --> 57:11.023
Really crazy.

57:11.056 --> 57:12.224
Remember, if you make a card,

57:12.258 --> 57:13.926
like the seven of clubs
disappear,

57:13.959 --> 57:15.895
you've always got to
make it reappear, right?

57:15.928 --> 57:16.562
Right?

57:16.595 --> 57:18.063
Check back in your sleeve.

57:23.969 --> 57:25.304
I don't even know what to say.

57:25.337 --> 57:28.140
Okay, now you gotta spill all
the beans

57:28.174 --> 57:29.909
and tell me exactly how you did
that.

57:29.942 --> 57:30.776
I can't tell you.

57:30.809 --> 57:31.477
You have to.

57:31.510 --> 57:34.346
Wow, okay then.

57:35.514 --> 57:36.448
That was amazing.

57:36.482 --> 57:38.384
I don't know how you
did any of that stuff.

57:38.417 --> 57:41.353
Seriously, it's crazy.

57:41.387 --> 57:44.190
Hey, you guys, did Javon come
in yet?

57:44.223 --> 57:46.992
No, we haven't seen him.

57:47.026 --> 57:49.862
Weird, he wasn't outside.

57:49.895 --> 57:50.930
That is weird.

57:52.164 --> 57:53.732
Okay, magic man.

57:53.766 --> 57:55.100
Enough with the tricks.

57:55.134 --> 57:56.435
What are you talking about?

57:56.468 --> 57:59.104
Making things disappear and
reappear.

57:59.138 --> 58:01.874
You really had me freaked out at
first.

58:01.907 --> 58:02.942
No matter how many times
I take off this ring,

58:02.975 --> 58:06.312
it just magically keeps
ending up back on my hand.

58:06.345 --> 58:08.047
Adrianna, I swear I didn't do
that.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.114
Right.

58:09.148 --> 58:10.916
I don't even know how
to do something like that.

58:10.950 --> 58:13.152
You're good, I just watched
it.

58:13.185 --> 58:15.221
It's the ring, it's chosen
you.

58:15.254 --> 58:17.790
What the hell are you
talking about, Becky?

58:17.823 --> 58:19.258
Well, according to ancient
legend,

58:19.291 --> 58:22.194
if the ring ever wound up
back with the white men

58:22.228 --> 58:25.364
it would find its way back
through her native bloodstream.

58:25.397 --> 58:26.966
Okay, all of that, that you're
reading,

58:26.999 --> 58:28.500
it's just Hocus Pocus bullshit.

58:28.534 --> 58:30.035
None of that's even true.

58:30.069 --> 58:31.303
Also, I'm only part Native
American.

58:31.337 --> 58:32.972
It just has to be in your
bloodstream.

58:33.005 --> 58:34.773
When you put the ring on you
activated it.

58:34.807 --> 58:37.376
Okay, enough with this
damn book already, seriously.

58:38.310 --> 58:39.078
Adrianna's right.

58:39.111 --> 58:40.012
We're getting ahead of
ourselves.

58:40.045 --> 58:41.947
Let's just try and find Javon
and Kayla.

58:41.981 --> 58:44.950
Yeah, that sounds like a plan
to me.

58:46.518 --> 58:47.353
Okay, Chase.

58:47.386 --> 58:49.888
I didn't turn them off.

59:22.921 --> 59:23.789
Kayla?

01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:52.538
Get it off me!

01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:54.039
Just get it off!

01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:05.250
Hey, listen.

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:07.553
I'm sure there's an
explanation for all of this.

01:02:07.586 --> 01:02:08.387
Oh, like what Eddie?

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.122
Where the hell is Kayla and
Javon?

01:02:10.155 --> 01:02:11.190
I don't know.

01:02:11.223 --> 01:02:13.091
They're probably out
messing around in the woods.

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:14.226
You know Kayla.

01:02:14.259 --> 01:02:16.094
Okay, so what's your
explanation for this damn ring

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:18.263
which I can't even get off my
finger now.

01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:20.365
All right, everyone,
let's just calm down.

01:02:20.399 --> 01:02:23.001
We'll figure this out together.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:24.603
You know, you seem a little
too calm

01:02:24.636 --> 01:02:26.371
if you ask me, Chase.

01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:29.508
What are you talking about,
Eddie?

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.210
What, you think you can scare
Adrianna

01:02:31.243 --> 01:02:33.412
with all your magic bullshit?

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.714
So you can just be the
hero that saves her?

01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:38.684
You're getting out of line
here.

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:39.585
Am I?

01:02:41.353 --> 01:02:42.588
Or do I have it all right?

01:02:44.656 --> 01:02:46.592
What are you doing, man?

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.126
Eddie, just please calm down.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.029
No, I won't calm down.

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:53.198
If you do anything else to scare
her,

01:02:53.232 --> 01:02:54.600
I swear to God.

01:02:54.633 --> 01:02:56.268
Okay, Eddie, just stop it.

01:02:56.301 --> 01:02:57.703
This is not helping anybody.

01:03:00.372 --> 01:03:01.707
I warned you.

01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:04.243
All right, you guys look,

01:03:04.276 --> 01:03:05.244
I don't know about you,

01:03:05.277 --> 01:03:07.112
but I really could just
use a drink right now

01:03:07.145 --> 01:03:09.147
just to calm my nerves down.

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:10.148
Come on, babe.

01:03:10.817 --> 01:03:12.785
Let's go back by the fire back.

01:03:12.819 --> 01:03:15.354
I'm sure Javon and Kayla are
back by now.

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:25.290
Chief Dohate cut off
his own daughter's hand.

01:04:26.425 --> 01:04:27.492
What a royal asshole

01:04:30.662 --> 01:04:31.530
Hello?

01:04:32.832 --> 01:04:34.600
Oh God.

01:04:34.633 --> 01:04:35.667
Becky?

01:04:35.701 --> 01:04:38.704
Jesus Christ, Chase,
you scared me after that.

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:40.539
Sorry, I didn't wanna disturb
you.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.374
I just wanted to make
sure you had a towel.

01:04:42.407 --> 01:04:45.444
Oh, okay, thanks.

01:04:45.477 --> 01:04:46.846
Hey, Chase.

01:04:46.879 --> 01:04:48.480
Yeah?

01:04:48.513 --> 01:04:50.549
Do you believe in ghosts?

01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:52.150
Why would you ask that?

01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:54.152
Well, you believe in magic.

01:04:54.186 --> 01:04:55.822
I mean like what's the
difference really?

01:04:55.855 --> 01:04:57.489
Besides, I think the curse of
chief Dohate

01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:59.859
does haunt these woods.

01:04:59.892 --> 01:05:01.360
I don't think so.

01:05:01.393 --> 01:05:02.361
But what about what you said
about,

01:05:02.394 --> 01:05:05.430
you know, before, about
hearing the drum beats?

01:05:05.464 --> 01:05:06.799
I was just messing around.

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:08.166
I think that this book has
started...

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.134
Hey wait, I wasn't finished.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:10.737
Did you know that in the next
county over,

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.170
at the Silver Lake Casino,

01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:14.373
the descendants of
Aiyana and Dohate's tribe

01:05:14.406 --> 01:05:15.942
live and work there?

01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:17.142
Yeah?

01:05:17.175 --> 01:05:18.845
Well, they can't be very
happy with you guys, can they?

01:05:18.878 --> 01:05:20.312
In their mind, it's the white
bred

01:05:20.345 --> 01:05:22.581
Larson family squatting on their
land.

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:23.281
Whoa.

01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:25.584
And what about that ring too?

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:27.486
Does that actually belong to you
guys?

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:28.720
Or did you take that too?

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:30.288
Becky, take it easy.

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:32.724
My family's totally cool with
that casino.

01:05:32.759 --> 01:05:34.693
They make a lot of money off of
the guests

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:36.662
that stay at Liberty Manor.

01:05:36.695 --> 01:05:38.931
As for the ring, I don't know.

01:05:38.965 --> 01:05:40.332
My dad's really protective of
it.

01:05:40.365 --> 01:05:41.768
He never takes it outta the
case.

01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.335
It's like an antique.

01:05:43.368 --> 01:05:45.570
This is my home you're talking
about.

01:05:45.604 --> 01:05:46.238
Sorry.

01:05:48.908 --> 01:05:51.309
I mean, there are some Indians

01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:55.247
that try to claim this land as
their own

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.784
but my family owns this
property fair and square.

01:05:58.851 --> 01:06:01.754
To the richest go the spoils I
guess.

01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:04.222
Besides, even if there was a
curse

01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:05.624
it worked out in your favor.

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:09.628
You know, sometimes I think

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:11.329
maybe there really is a curse.

01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:15.600
Anyways, I think we're both
getting a little freaked out

01:06:15.634 --> 01:06:17.003
by these stories, so...

01:06:17.036 --> 01:06:17.970
You're probably right.

01:06:18.004 --> 01:06:20.907
We should just relax,
it is winter break.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.607
You're right.

01:06:22.641 --> 01:06:25.510
I'm probably just, you
know, give me 30 minutes.

01:06:25.544 --> 01:06:29.414
I just need to detox from
my, my chemistry final.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:30.850
All right, take your time.

01:06:30.883 --> 01:06:31.751
Thanks.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:15.594
Look, I know you think
I'm crazy right now,

01:07:15.627 --> 01:07:17.730
but something is really going on
here.

01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:27.339
Fuck that guy.

01:07:29.976 --> 01:07:33.012
I don't think Chase had
anything to do with this.

01:07:33.045 --> 01:07:34.312
How do you explain it?

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:35.313
I don't know, dude.

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:36.949
How does this ring just
keep getting on my hand.

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:39.919
I took this ring off and
I put it back in the study

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:41.888
and it just keeps ending
up back on my hand

01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:44.723
over and over and over again.

01:07:44.757 --> 01:07:46.358
I know and I'm telling you

01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:48.393
Chase has to be up to this.

01:07:48.426 --> 01:07:50.395
There's something else going
on here.

01:07:50.428 --> 01:07:52.364
He's the only one that knows
magic.

01:07:52.397 --> 01:07:53.032
This has to be magic.

01:07:53.065 --> 01:07:54.734
This is not magic.

01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:56.468
Magic, doesn't work that way.

01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:57.369
Then how does it work?

01:07:57.402 --> 01:07:58.503
How do you explain this?

01:07:58.537 --> 01:08:00.807
I don't know how to explain
this.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.641
This whole place, this whole
house,

01:08:02.674 --> 01:08:04.543
the story, the burial ground,

01:08:04.576 --> 01:08:07.013
everything that's
happening to us, around us.

01:08:09.648 --> 01:08:11.416
None of it makes sense.

01:08:11.449 --> 01:08:12.285
No, it doesn't.

01:08:15.587 --> 01:08:18.925
I just wanna go, dude, I just
wanna go.

01:08:48.888 --> 01:08:50.122
Stop struggling.

01:09:12.477 --> 01:09:14.113
This water is now your hell.

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:34.432
Do you hear that?

01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:37.535
Hear what?

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:38.703
Shh, listen.

01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:45.877
What is that?

01:09:48.747 --> 01:09:49.948
Eddie, what's going on?

01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:53.618
What the hell?

01:09:53.652 --> 01:09:54.653
Oh my God.

01:09:54.686 --> 01:09:55.553
Stay back!

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:05.064
Don't make me use it!

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.807
Stay back!

01:10:20.212 --> 01:10:21.747
What's happening?

01:11:29.315 --> 01:11:30.783
Oh God, Becky!

01:11:34.353 --> 01:11:35.553
Becky?

01:11:35.587 --> 01:11:36.688
Oh my God!

01:11:36.721 --> 01:11:37.589
Oh my God!

01:11:43.362 --> 01:11:44.764
Eddie, look behind
you!

01:11:44.797 --> 01:11:45.630
Eddie!

01:11:45.663 --> 01:11:46.732
Eddie!

01:11:46.766 --> 01:11:48.100
Eddie, oh my God!

01:11:49.368 --> 01:11:50.236
Oh my God!

01:11:55.841 --> 01:11:57.243
Adrianna!

01:12:01.646 --> 01:12:03.249
Stop it, just stop!

01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:30.776
Get back here!

01:13:12.084 --> 01:13:13.085
Not so fast.

01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:44.343
No!

01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:58.057
Don't fight me.

01:15:27.353 --> 01:15:28.354
She has the ring.

01:15:33.859 --> 01:15:35.027
What are you doing?

01:15:56.282 --> 01:15:57.349
Get off me, please.

01:15:57.383 --> 01:15:58.917
Please, please!

01:16:20.072 --> 01:16:22.007
Relax and I won't hurt you.

01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:24.109
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:16:45.898 --> 01:16:47.833
Just do as you're told.

01:17:17.463 --> 01:17:19.164
Get the fuck off of me!

01:17:19.198 --> 01:17:20.065
Relax!

01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:28.173
My father has been expecting
you.

01:17:28.207 --> 01:17:29.675
I'll take her from here.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:30.576
Okay.

01:17:36.382 --> 01:17:37.316
Have a seat.

01:17:45.257 --> 01:17:47.192
Thank you for coming, Adrianna.

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:49.495
I don't think I had much of a
choice.

01:17:52.197 --> 01:17:53.065
Is that for me?

01:17:53.966 --> 01:17:55.467
What?

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:56.969
Let me see it, please.

01:17:57.737 --> 01:17:58.604
See what?

01:17:59.571 --> 01:18:01.073
My ring you are wearing.

01:18:03.609 --> 01:18:05.911
It won't come off, I've tried.

01:18:07.312 --> 01:18:08.380
It will now, try.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:26.498
Many of my people have died for
this ring.

01:18:27.633 --> 01:18:29.034
Many of mine too.

01:18:29.067 --> 01:18:30.369
Thanks to you, I'm guessing.

01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:33.472
Collateral damage, I'm afraid

01:18:34.373 --> 01:18:37.342
Your friends desecrated hallowed
ground.

01:18:37.376 --> 01:18:39.378
Our forefathers tilled the soil,

01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:43.015
fed our hungry and buried our
slaughtered,

01:18:43.048 --> 01:18:47.186
and what they call deep
irony and great disrespect.

01:18:47.219 --> 01:18:49.721
Liberty Manor Estate.

01:18:49.756 --> 01:18:51.523
The Larson family owned that
land.

01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:52.991
Bullshit!

01:18:54.226 --> 01:18:57.329
This land was taken from
my people, illegally.

01:18:58.597 --> 01:19:03.302
For more than 200 years,
we've been regulated to this.

01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:06.505
This God-forsaken casino.

01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:10.209
A government handout.

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:12.611
Do you have any idea what this
does

01:19:12.644 --> 01:19:15.247
to the collective psyche of a
nation?

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.049
A once proud nation of warriors,

01:19:17.082 --> 01:19:19.218
leaders, and heroes?

01:19:21.353 --> 01:19:22.621
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:19:22.654 --> 01:19:24.423
Oh, you're sorry?

01:19:24.456 --> 01:19:26.158
Isn't that rich?

01:19:26.191 --> 01:19:28.060
Everybody's sorry.

01:19:28.093 --> 01:19:31.029
They, they take my land.

01:19:31.063 --> 01:19:32.364
They take my heritage.

01:19:34.466 --> 01:19:36.235
You know what we get in return?

01:19:36.268 --> 01:19:37.369
What?

01:19:39.304 --> 01:19:42.708
The jungle room, a guttered
casino,

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:46.078
a lot of hollow apologies.

01:19:48.313 --> 01:19:50.482
This ring represents
all that has gone wrong

01:19:50.516 --> 01:19:52.217
these last 200 years.

01:19:54.319 --> 01:19:56.823
As Chief Tocho, I owe my people

01:19:56.856 --> 01:19:59.725
the chance to honor their
dead the proper way.

01:19:59.759 --> 01:20:02.461
I'm sorry for what happened
to your people but I...

01:20:02.494 --> 01:20:03.428
Our people.

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:05.597
Excuse me?

01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:07.299
You see, the ring chose you.

01:20:08.768 --> 01:20:10.269
The ring brought you to me.

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:15.207
The only way to break that
curse is with true native blood.

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:19.511
You do know somewhat about
your heritage, don't you?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.147
I was adopted.

01:20:23.582 --> 01:20:25.752
Well, the one thing
you should know, child,

01:20:25.785 --> 01:20:26.853
man does not own the land

01:20:26.886 --> 01:20:28.755
any more than an Eagle owns the
sky.

01:20:30.289 --> 01:20:32.190
The land is a hollowed ground.

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:36.194
And while not owned, as
the white man defines it.

01:20:37.296 --> 01:20:40.132
It will again be occupied by my
tribe.

01:20:40.165 --> 01:20:41.500
How do you plan on doing that?

01:20:41.533 --> 01:20:44.169
More bloodshed, more killings?

01:20:44.202 --> 01:20:45.370
I hope not.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:49.842
The only thing that stopped us
until now has been this ring.

01:20:49.876 --> 01:20:52.144
For generations it's haunted my
people.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:57.382
What are you gonna do with it?

01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:02.321
This rings domain belongs to
no man.

01:21:03.221 --> 01:21:05.257
I don't understand.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:08.393
Bury the ring, bury the curse.

01:21:13.933 --> 01:21:16.335
This ring will no longer reign
supreme,

01:21:17.402 --> 01:21:19.605
but be given back to the Earth.

01:21:19.638 --> 01:21:20.907
What are you gonna do with me?

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:21.808
Kill me?

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:24.476
No, of course not.

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:29.481
Curse of the ring is broken,
you're to thank for that.

01:21:30.682 --> 01:21:33.151
It's time we write a new
chapter.

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:35.721
No more bloodshed, no more
death.

01:21:36.655 --> 01:21:39.358
Unless of course you and
Javon care to make trouble.

01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:41.560
Javon, he's alive?

01:21:41.593 --> 01:21:42.829
The ring carefully chooses

01:21:42.862 --> 01:21:44.797
who it needs to pay it's debts.

01:21:44.831 --> 01:21:46.833
Didn't want you or Javon.

01:21:46.866 --> 01:21:49.635
Now with the ring no
longer in our possession,

01:21:49.668 --> 01:21:51.203
the tragic events from last
night

01:21:51.236 --> 01:21:52.704
have no ties to me or my people.

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:54.874
I was quite careful about that.

01:21:57.275 --> 01:21:58.410
You will take this.

01:22:02.949 --> 01:22:05.317
I don't want your hush money.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:07.552
Let me remind you there
are four dead bodies

01:22:07.586 --> 01:22:09.488
at a party that you were at.

01:22:09.521 --> 01:22:11.323
The only one missing is you.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:14.794
And then there's this,
the security footage.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.976
I didn't do any of this.

01:22:30.009 --> 01:22:33.211
What kind of fucking sick
game are playing here?

01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:35.280
Of course you didn't,
sweetheart.

01:22:35.313 --> 01:22:37.349
But how do you plan on
explaining that to the police

01:22:37.382 --> 01:22:39.251
that are currently questioning
Javon?

01:22:40.787 --> 01:22:41.687
Let me start again.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.589
My guys will bring you back to
the house.

01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:46.458
You will come running through
the woods

01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:48.460
claiming you were tied up and
beaten

01:22:48.493 --> 01:22:49.494
and you just got free.

01:22:52.397 --> 01:22:54.767
Damon, the man that was
shot dead in front of you

01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:57.804
will take the fall for all the
events that occurred tonight.

01:23:00.773 --> 01:23:03.241
Mr. Greene, the new grounds
keeper

01:23:03.275 --> 01:23:04.609
will collaborate the story

01:23:04.643 --> 01:23:06.946
and take responsibility for
shooting.

01:23:09.048 --> 01:23:10.917
The footage of you will be
destroyed.

01:23:12.417 --> 01:23:15.320
And I will offer the Larson's
an offer they can't refuse.

01:23:16.488 --> 01:23:19.725
To sell their property that's
filled with horrible memories.

01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:19.578
Help!

01:25:21.147 --> 01:25:22.014
Help!

01:25:26.451 --> 01:25:27.452
Please help.

01:25:32.959 --> 01:25:33.960
Who are you?

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.009
What is this place?

01:25:51.576 --> 01:25:52.577
Who are you?

01:25:53.645 --> 01:25:55.714
What do you want from me?

01:27:20.733 --> 01:27:21.599
What!

01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:26.571
You were never gonna pay me my
money.

01:27:26.604 --> 01:27:30.109
It seems betrayal is not
only a white man's trait.

01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:45.057
I want my money!

01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:48.260
Listen carefully, Chief,

01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:51.831
when you dance with the devil,

01:27:51.864 --> 01:27:54.566
it's the devil that picks the
tune.

01:27:55.768 --> 01:27:56.634
Adios!

01:29:28.427 --> 01:29:31.864
Who am I?

01:29:31.897 --> 01:29:33.866
I am the companion.

01:29:35.734 --> 01:29:36.601
The black wind.

01:30:03.462 --> 01:30:04.396
I am Damon.

01:31:36.188 --> 01:31:37.189
How are you?

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.902
So how have you been?

01:31:49.935 --> 01:31:51.170
Where have you been?

01:31:51.203 --> 01:31:52.838
I know, I'm sorry.

01:31:52.871 --> 01:31:55.140
I think I just needed a
little bit of time, you know?

01:31:55.174 --> 01:31:57.776
It just got really hard there
for awhile.

01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:02.047
I get that, I, I definitely
understand.

01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:04.383
So, we should do something this
weekend.

01:32:05.484 --> 01:32:08.254
Not anything that has to
do with any creepy masks

01:32:08.287 --> 01:32:10.356
or weirdos or anything like that

01:32:10.389 --> 01:32:13.259
but, I don't know, nothing, have
fun.

01:32:13.292 --> 01:32:15.027
That actually sounds
like it could be nice,

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.128
but there's actually something

01:32:16.161 --> 01:32:18.063
I gotta go take care of though
first.

01:32:18.097 --> 01:32:19.431
So, I think I'm gonna go head
and do that,

01:32:19.465 --> 01:32:21.233
but I'll be here this weekend
for sure.

01:32:21.267 --> 01:32:26.005
Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.515
So, here you are.

01:33:43.549 --> 01:33:45.417
What took you so long to find
me?

01:33:45.451 --> 01:33:46.385
You bastard!

01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:49.655
Your hand shakes 'cause you
have doubt.

01:33:49.688 --> 01:33:51.357
You ain't gonna pull that
trigger.

01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:52.925
Fuck you, I don't have any
doubt.

01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:54.560
You killed my friends.

01:33:54.593 --> 01:33:56.628
Your friends were standing in
my way.

01:33:56.662 --> 01:33:59.298
And you'd kill me too
if given the chance.

01:33:59.331 --> 01:34:03.402
You know what, honey,
if I wanted you dead,

01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:06.505
we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now, would we?

01:34:06.538 --> 01:34:08.374
You liked killing them?

01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:10.976
Well, that should make no
difference

01:34:11.009 --> 01:34:15.080
because killing comes
easier for some people.

01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:17.015
Like me.

01:34:19.418 --> 01:34:21.553
It was never supposed to be
like this,

01:34:21.587 --> 01:34:23.322
you promised that you
never would've done that.

01:34:23.355 --> 01:34:25.924
It was never supposed to be like
this.

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:28.060
The ring had to be secured

01:34:28.093 --> 01:34:29.928
and your friends got in the way.

01:34:29.962 --> 01:34:31.296
Stop saying that.

01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:33.665
Fuck you, stop saying that!

01:34:33.699 --> 01:34:34.900
I needed the ring

01:34:34.933 --> 01:34:38.470
and I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

01:34:38.504 --> 01:34:40.072
You will be compensated.

01:34:40.105 --> 01:34:42.341
I'm not afraid of you, not
anymore.

01:34:43.475 --> 01:34:45.310
I don't want your blood money.

01:34:45.344 --> 01:34:47.679
Adrianna, put the gun down.

01:34:50.549 --> 01:34:52.251
The chief put a bounty on your
head.

01:34:52.284 --> 01:34:53.619
I kill you and bring him the
mask

01:34:53.652 --> 01:34:55.521
and I'll have all the
money I'll ever need.

01:34:55.554 --> 01:34:58.190
You really think the
chief is gonna let you live?

01:34:58.223 --> 01:35:01.226
First the ring and now the mask.

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.196
An evil wind blows through him.

01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:06.932
The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

01:35:07.666 --> 01:35:09.001
I'll take my chances.

01:35:10.402 --> 01:35:13.439
Adrianna, the curse is alive.

01:35:13.472 --> 01:35:16.175
An evil wind blows through you
too.

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:20.479
The weakness of the enemy,
creates our strength.

01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:25.484
from the strength, we can
thrive in life and in death.

01:35:25.517 --> 01:35:30.355
After all, all those before
us are not really dead,

01:35:30.389 --> 01:35:34.159
their hearts can beat in the
souls that they leave behind.

01:35:34.193 --> 01:35:35.394
There is honor in death.

01:35:35.427 --> 01:35:40.199
There is dignity in passing
from this world into the next,

01:35:40.232 --> 01:35:44.102
after all the tragedy
of life is not death.

01:35:44.136 --> 01:35:47.206
The tragedy of life is what
we let die inside of us

01:35:47.239 --> 01:35:48.140
while we live.
