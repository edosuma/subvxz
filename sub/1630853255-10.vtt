00:18.369 --> 00:24.309
* All of us living
under heaven *

00:28.146 --> 00:32.317
* All of us doing
what we're told *

00:35.486 --> 00:40.458
* You lie awake,
you hear her call *

00:40.491 --> 00:46.364
* You're thinking of
the time you lost and *

00:49.500 --> 00:54.505
* All of us living
under heaven *

00:54.539 --> 00:56.741
Center. Right.

00:58.743 --> 01:01.646
One, two, three.

01:01.679 --> 01:03.648
* You and me

01:03.681 --> 01:08.386
* Delusionally

01:08.419 --> 01:13.023
* We rise and fall

01:13.023 --> 01:17.061
* And after it all

01:18.095 --> 01:22.867
* Only you

01:29.374 --> 01:33.544
* You and me

01:33.544 --> 01:38.549
* Delusionally

01:38.583 --> 01:43.688
* We rise and fall

01:43.721 --> 01:48.226

Otro día.

03:34.164 --> 03:36.033
(birds chirping)

03:48.746 --> 03:51.416
(breathes shakily)

04:01.526 --> 04:04.362
You didn't fucking
deserve him.

04:04.362 --> 04:06.196
None of you did.

04:08.032 --> 04:10.368
You didn't fucking deserve him!

04:11.869 --> 04:13.771
You killed him!

04:17.207 --> 04:19.944
(crying):
And I'll never forgive you.

04:23.414 --> 04:25.115
I'll never forgive you.

04:31.389 --> 04:33.391

(monitors beeping steadily)

05:21.606 --> 05:23.474
Hi, beautiful.

05:25.443 --> 05:27.945
I brought you these.

05:30.114 --> 05:32.116
Wanna smell 'em?

05:32.116 --> 05:33.984
(inhales sharply)

05:34.018 --> 05:35.453
(sniffs)

05:37.021 --> 05:38.989
What are you doing here?
(grunts)

05:40.024 --> 05:43.461
Well, you know that green light
you were begging for?

05:43.494 --> 05:45.663
Wow.

05:45.696 --> 05:49.299
What a fuckin' shit show
that turned into, huh?

05:50.801 --> 05:53.604
I'm sorry, man, but...

05:53.638 --> 05:56.974
And now it brought back
that fucking demon

05:57.007 --> 05:59.677
that we all thought was dead
out in the desert.

05:59.710 --> 06:02.146
I didn't know.

06:02.146 --> 06:04.649
-Shh. Shh.
-All right?

06:04.682 --> 06:06.984
-I didn't know.
-Shh.

06:07.017 --> 06:10.154
Don't strain, you poor thing.

06:12.523 --> 06:14.692
They taking care of you here?

06:14.725 --> 06:17.828
What are they doing to you?
Is somebody shaving you?

06:17.862 --> 06:20.330
Can you breathe okay?

06:20.330 --> 06:21.532
(grunts)

06:24.168 --> 06:25.636
(gasping, choking)

06:25.670 --> 06:28.038
(monitor beeping rapidly)

06:32.710 --> 06:35.045

(muffled cries)

06:50.094 --> 06:51.829
NURSE:
Hey.

06:51.862 --> 06:55.332
Just a little asphyxiation
play, sweetheart.

06:55.365 --> 06:57.502
(gasping)

06:57.535 --> 07:00.337
Don't you dare kink shame
me and my bruiser.

07:00.370 --> 07:03.240
Shh. Go on, go on, go on.

07:06.711 --> 07:09.413
(gasping)

07:12.550 --> 07:15.520
(laughing)

07:15.553 --> 07:17.254
You should have seen
your face, man.

07:17.287 --> 07:19.089
"Aah..."

07:20.591 --> 07:23.227
I gotta tell you, it's been
forever since I choked somebody.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.029
That felt really good.

07:25.062 --> 07:27.397
(breathing heavily)

07:27.431 --> 07:30.234
You couldn't just say
"fuck you," huh?

07:30.267 --> 07:32.269
(groaning)

07:38.242 --> 07:39.910
Is it true?

07:41.946 --> 07:44.114
What?

07:45.415 --> 07:47.084
Is he back?

07:59.463 --> 08:01.431
Yes, Virginia,

08:01.431 --> 08:04.769
there is a devil.

08:04.769 --> 08:07.772
Oh... and fuck you.

08:13.611 --> 08:16.781
(whispering in Spanish)

08:19.984 --> 08:22.486
(door opens)

08:22.519 --> 08:24.622
(baby fussing)

08:24.622 --> 08:26.624
You home?

08:26.657 --> 08:28.292
Yeah.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.795
-(groans)
-(thunder rumbling)

08:33.130 --> 08:35.933
Oh, hey.

08:35.966 --> 08:39.203
(grunting playfully)

08:43.140 --> 08:46.310
How you doing,
little man? Huh?

08:46.310 --> 08:48.145
You love your bottle, yeah.
Get your bottle.

08:48.145 --> 08:50.447
Come here. Come here. Yeah.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.183
-Yes.
-Angel, you're gonna
get him wet.

08:53.217 --> 08:55.319
I'm not gonna get him wet.
Come here.

08:55.352 --> 08:57.622
-Yeah.
-(babbles)

08:57.655 --> 08:59.857
My boy.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.826
Are you good?

09:01.859 --> 09:03.127
Yeah?

09:03.160 --> 09:05.295
He won't sleep.

09:05.329 --> 09:10.635
That's okay. Come on.
(mutters)

09:10.668 --> 09:12.670
Coco's funeral...

09:14.872 --> 09:16.340
...was it bad?

09:18.709 --> 09:20.911
Yeah.

09:24.181 --> 09:25.883
But you're good.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.018
(baby fussing)

09:28.018 --> 09:31.188
Oh, yeah, you're good.

09:31.221 --> 09:34.091
You're good, aren't you, boy?

09:38.929 --> 09:41.899
(baby babbling)

09:53.043 --> 09:55.412
* Songs of losers
and dreamers *

09:55.445 --> 09:57.882
* Can be such a drag

10:00.250 --> 10:02.052
* Birthdays and graduations...

10:02.052 --> 10:03.721
Copy that.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.224
Just confirmed it.

10:07.224 --> 10:09.593
Yeah.

10:09.626 --> 10:11.061
What's up?

10:11.095 --> 10:15.900
Yuma, Stockton, Oakland.

10:15.933 --> 10:18.068
They left here to go
meet without us.

10:18.068 --> 10:20.705
-It's non-sanctioned.
-Without us?

10:20.738 --> 10:23.708
HANK:
Yeah. Apparently, they thought

10:23.741 --> 10:26.744
we weren't gonna find out
about it.

10:26.744 --> 10:30.080
LOBO:
Ranchside Café, off the 52.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.750
(indistinct chatter)

10:35.585 --> 10:39.423
* Jackson, don't worry,
you're a good man's son *

10:39.423 --> 10:43.794
* But damn you should've seen us
back when we were young *

10:43.828 --> 10:47.798
* Toughest set of kids that
the Mohawk had ever seen *

10:50.935 --> 10:52.469
* Jackson, don't worry...

10:52.502 --> 10:55.139
So...

10:55.172 --> 10:56.774
what are we gonna do?

10:56.807 --> 10:58.776
BISHOP:
Fuck 'em.

10:58.809 --> 11:01.846
Fuck every motherfucking
one of 'em.

11:09.954 --> 11:11.956
(brakes squeak)

11:17.661 --> 11:20.630
Oh, shit.

11:20.664 --> 11:21.932
What's up, bro?

11:21.966 --> 11:23.934
You're late.

11:23.968 --> 11:27.805
-I got held up.
-Let's make one thing clear.

11:27.838 --> 11:30.340
After this, we're square.
You got that?

11:30.374 --> 11:34.111
Yeah, bro, I appreciate it.
I truly do.

11:34.144 --> 11:36.646
There's 80 grand in there.

11:38.215 --> 11:40.350
When we finish, it's yours.

11:41.685 --> 11:44.121
Jesus, 80 grand?

11:44.154 --> 11:45.455
What's the job?

11:45.489 --> 11:48.025
I need help tying up
a loose end.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.395
Whatever you need,
you know I got you, bro.

11:55.332 --> 11:57.334
I hope so.

11:59.403 --> 12:00.905
So what's the loose end?

12:05.575 --> 12:06.877
You.

12:07.912 --> 12:10.314
Ezekiel...

12:10.347 --> 12:11.882
Open the bag.

12:13.884 --> 12:15.519
Open it.

12:20.357 --> 12:22.192
There's one bullet in there.

12:22.192 --> 12:23.327
You pull that trigger,

12:23.360 --> 12:25.529
your family gets all that money.

12:27.064 --> 12:30.200
I pull this one...

12:30.200 --> 12:31.568
you got nothing coming.

12:31.601 --> 12:34.004
You want me to fucking...

12:34.038 --> 12:37.074
Do it...

12:37.107 --> 12:38.708
and they'll be taken care of.

12:38.742 --> 12:41.778
I know you're not serious, man.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.382
You want me to go out
like a fucking punk?

12:45.382 --> 12:48.118
I'm giving you the power
to go out like a king.

12:51.221 --> 12:53.257
Or be put down like a dog.

12:54.892 --> 12:57.261
I fuckin' made you, man.

12:57.294 --> 12:59.063
You did.

13:00.764 --> 13:04.268
They would have killed you,
and I brought you in.

13:06.136 --> 13:08.538
You were a little boy.

13:08.572 --> 13:10.774
A little scared-ass,

13:10.807 --> 13:14.544
pussy-ass little boy!

13:14.578 --> 13:16.947
And I made you a fucking man!

13:16.981 --> 13:19.383
That's why I'm giving you
the choice.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.585
You know I was never
gonna say nothing.

13:21.585 --> 13:23.420
I can't take that chance.

13:23.453 --> 13:25.655
The club needs me.

13:27.591 --> 13:31.261
Suze, the girls.

13:31.261 --> 13:33.263
You've met them.

13:35.599 --> 13:37.767
My girls, bro.

13:39.436 --> 13:42.272
They won't remember me.

13:42.306 --> 13:44.341
They'll never know me.

13:47.978 --> 13:50.247
This is gonna weigh on you.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.117
This is gonna weigh
on your soul.

13:53.117 --> 13:55.285
It won't.

14:10.334 --> 14:12.336
*

14:27.151 --> 14:29.486
(sniffs)

14:29.519 --> 14:31.155
Fuck it.

14:31.188 --> 14:33.390
Don't do it.

14:37.995 --> 14:39.396
Think about your family.

14:40.497 --> 14:43.533
Fuck you.
I ain't no punk.

15:01.018 --> 15:03.020
(crickets chirping)

15:03.053 --> 15:05.055
(speaking inaudibly)

15:12.029 --> 15:13.730
Can I get you guys
anything else?

15:13.763 --> 15:14.898
What else you got?

15:14.931 --> 15:17.001
I believe that
that is a menu

15:17.034 --> 15:18.368
sitting right in front of you.

15:18.368 --> 15:20.070
How about something off-menu?

15:20.104 --> 15:23.040
Uh, miss, I'm sorry
for my friend.

15:23.073 --> 15:25.709
He's illiterate.
Don't pay him any attention.

15:25.709 --> 15:27.511
I'd say that's the least
of his worries.

15:27.544 --> 15:29.546
Vicky, he'll have
the banana cream pie.

15:29.579 --> 15:31.381
Yeah? Cool?

15:31.415 --> 15:32.882
Thank you.

15:32.916 --> 15:34.351
I don't even want
the banana cream pie.

15:34.384 --> 15:35.552
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

15:35.552 --> 15:38.555
-I wanted her to get...
-DONDO: Enough!

15:38.588 --> 15:40.890
It's fucking suspicious.

15:40.924 --> 15:43.693
Look, man,
Canche was family, right?

15:43.727 --> 15:45.729
-Fucking family.
-Yeah, Manny.

15:45.762 --> 15:47.031
But I know the Reyes brothers,
man.

15:47.064 --> 15:48.098
I don't think they're
capable of doing this...

15:48.132 --> 15:49.899
They shot Ramos in the face.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.036
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

15:52.069 --> 15:55.205
Santo Padre had it out
for Canche.

15:55.239 --> 15:57.274
And your fucking Reyes brothers
were the last motherfuckers

15:57.307 --> 15:58.708
to see him alive.

15:58.742 --> 16:01.078
Why else would they split us up

16:01.111 --> 16:03.747
for the Berdoo hit?

16:03.780 --> 16:06.050
Divide and fucking conquer.

16:06.083 --> 16:09.719
-What did Diaz say?
-He finds it "curious."

16:09.753 --> 16:11.455
MAN:
Thank you, darling.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.393
(entry bell jingles)

16:16.426 --> 16:18.395
What about Downer?

16:18.428 --> 16:19.763
What's he say, man?
He was there.

16:19.763 --> 16:22.232
Downer can't see
past his own dick.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.601
(laughs)

16:25.969 --> 16:28.138
-(clears throat)
-I'm just saying

16:28.172 --> 16:31.608
if any one of us
would have been there,

16:31.608 --> 16:34.111
Canche'd be with us
right now,

16:34.111 --> 16:36.780
and this kid would still
have his pops.

16:36.780 --> 16:40.417
Fuck that. We got to fucking
do something.

16:40.450 --> 16:42.752
Fuck. Yeah,
maybe you're right.

16:42.786 --> 16:44.954
Maybe something's up.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.990
-Now you're talking.
-Where's that bitch

16:47.023 --> 16:48.458
with my banana cream pie?

16:51.495 --> 16:52.829
Ah, fuck!

16:52.862 --> 16:55.132
-Oh, shit!
-(excited chatter)

16:55.132 --> 16:57.301
-Don't move!
-Get your fucking hands up!

16:57.334 --> 16:59.803
*

17:23.360 --> 17:26.363
MARCUS: I don't have the same
taste for it anymore.

17:26.396 --> 17:29.166
You know, the war, the blood.

17:29.199 --> 17:31.701
If it don't make your dick hard,
you probably shouldn't fuck it.

17:32.736 --> 17:34.504
Just sayin'.

17:34.538 --> 17:37.006
It's one thing if it's done
for the greater good.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.043
San Bernardino was
for the greater good.

17:40.076 --> 17:42.179
We're just gonna have to agree
to fucking disagree on that one.

17:42.212 --> 17:44.348
You're the one that
called us out, ese.

17:44.348 --> 17:47.351
And for what? Handling business
on your turf?

17:47.384 --> 17:48.918
What are you fucking
talking about?

17:50.187 --> 17:53.190
The two Stockton Mayans
Santo Padre took out in Berdoo.

17:53.223 --> 17:54.558
Fuck, go ahead
and kill each other.

17:54.591 --> 17:56.160
No one cares about that.
This here--

17:56.193 --> 17:57.227
this here is about Montez.

17:57.261 --> 17:59.329
-Montez?
-Yeah.

17:59.363 --> 18:01.498
Some chick, she came to us
with his kutte.

18:01.531 --> 18:04.234
Found him dead
on Mayan property.

18:05.269 --> 18:07.036
I know nothing about that.

18:08.905 --> 18:11.675
-I liked Montez.
-I was slightly impartial,

18:11.708 --> 18:15.044
but still, I didn't want to see
him dead in a fuckin' barrel.

18:20.250 --> 18:24.020
-One of my guys?
-I don't know. You tell me.

18:24.053 --> 18:28.258
But that's why we're doing this
right here right now.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.694
What's happened
to this life, Tig?

18:30.727 --> 18:33.230
-Yeah.
-Seems like nobody
has a code anymore.

18:33.230 --> 18:36.533
-Back in the old days, we...
-Are just that: old.

18:36.566 --> 18:38.067
I guess I'm just feeling my age.

18:39.068 --> 18:41.605
Getting old doesn't fare well
in this world.

18:45.409 --> 18:47.944
I've been thinking about Esai
a lot lately, you know.

18:47.977 --> 18:50.113
Don't, man.

18:50.146 --> 18:52.449
No good will come of it.

18:56.953 --> 18:58.922
-You ever think about...
-No.

19:00.089 --> 19:04.261
That's because you got justice.
Took out Pope.

19:04.261 --> 19:08.898
I haven't got mines. I mean,
He'll have His say in it.

19:08.932 --> 19:12.269
And I'll be paying the price,
but I will get mines.

19:12.302 --> 19:14.304
Come on, man.

19:14.338 --> 19:16.105
Esai put you in a tough spot.

19:16.139 --> 19:20.277
I put him in a tough spot,
bringing him into this life.

19:20.310 --> 19:23.079
I want to do it better
this time around, you know?

19:23.112 --> 19:25.415
For Tessa.

19:25.449 --> 19:28.117
Me and Izzy adopted a boy.

19:28.117 --> 19:29.619
Ah.

19:29.619 --> 19:31.921
Making different choices.

19:31.955 --> 19:33.623
Better choices.

19:33.657 --> 19:36.293
I don't think you're
becoming an old man.

19:36.293 --> 19:38.127
I think you're becoming
a good man.

19:38.127 --> 19:40.297
That definitely doesn't
fare well in our world.

19:43.367 --> 19:46.169
-I found me a good woman, Tig.
-I prefer 'em bad.

19:47.203 --> 19:48.805
Sexy and bad.

19:48.838 --> 19:51.775
-I know how you prefer them.
-(Tig chuckles)

19:51.808 --> 19:53.977
Hey, no.

19:54.010 --> 19:57.814
What we do-- it can get ugly.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.649
But it's what we do. Right?

19:59.649 --> 20:01.150
People sign up for fodder,

20:01.150 --> 20:03.820
I say feed 'em to
the fuckin' cannon.

20:03.820 --> 20:07.190
Our day's gonna come
soon enough, you and me, bro.

20:07.223 --> 20:09.493
Just like Doc's.

20:09.526 --> 20:11.495
Just like Packer.

20:11.528 --> 20:14.698
Packer, crazy bugger.
Still hanging in.

20:14.731 --> 20:18.134
Death itself can't even
kill that motherfucker.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.470
Yeah, they don't make 'em
like that anymore.

20:20.504 --> 20:23.340
All right, I'm gonna
take this back to Chibby.

20:23.340 --> 20:26.376
Um, there's something
you should know.

20:26.410 --> 20:30.514
Packer's baby brother,
he's back.

20:30.514 --> 20:33.650
-That fucker's still alive?
-Alas.

20:33.683 --> 20:35.319
I thought he'd at least
be out bad,

20:35.352 --> 20:37.020
all that fucked-up shit he did.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.523
Packer looked out for him, bro.

20:39.556 --> 20:41.558
I mean, he's blinded
by his own family ties.

20:41.591 --> 20:42.859
You know about that.

20:42.892 --> 20:45.362
I'm not lying to you
when I tell you this.

20:45.395 --> 20:47.230
That kid-- he's got it out
for the Mayans.

20:47.263 --> 20:50.367
All that hate inside of him,
it's not healthy.

20:54.438 --> 20:57.841
If the Sons don't land
on peace...

20:57.874 --> 20:59.676
next time we see each other,

20:59.709 --> 21:01.378
it ain't gonna be
on equal ground.

21:01.411 --> 21:03.713
I'm getting hard just
at the thought of it, brother.

21:04.948 --> 21:06.215
Crazy.

21:07.417 --> 21:08.752
Ride safe, you sick fuck.

21:08.785 --> 21:10.286
Always.

21:12.922 --> 21:14.924
*

21:19.228 --> 21:21.398
(engine starts)

21:37.246 --> 21:38.815
I'm not wired.

21:44.754 --> 21:47.424
I told you,

21:47.424 --> 21:49.393
I got nothing
to fuckin' say to you.

21:49.426 --> 21:51.761
Let me protect you, Neron.

21:53.262 --> 21:55.264
Protect me?

21:55.298 --> 21:58.768
You fuckin' killed me.

21:58.768 --> 22:01.505
You know what the club
would do if they knew?

22:02.606 --> 22:05.108
What they would do to me?!

22:05.141 --> 22:06.510
(scoffs)

22:11.114 --> 22:12.816
What is your name?

22:14.951 --> 22:17.153
I'll bet it's not
even Kody, is it?

22:17.186 --> 22:20.189
-It's Katie.
-(laughs)

22:21.791 --> 22:24.293
(sniffs deeply)

22:24.327 --> 22:29.198
Everything you fucking said
is a fucking lie.

22:31.801 --> 22:33.837
I have never lied to you.

22:37.641 --> 22:40.143
It's just complicated.

22:41.811 --> 22:43.713
Fuck this.

22:47.817 --> 22:49.653
We have you.

22:50.654 --> 22:52.689
Fuck you!

22:52.722 --> 22:56.660
You ain't got fuckin' shit!

23:00.163 --> 23:02.331
"Shot point blank by these

23:02.331 --> 23:04.668
Samoan motherfuckers."

23:06.069 --> 23:09.873
You were shot in a carjacking.

23:09.906 --> 23:13.710
Box truck, burned and abandoned
on Route 111.

23:13.743 --> 23:16.680
An incident that later resulted
in nine homicides

23:16.680 --> 23:19.215
in Nunez Cemetery,

23:19.248 --> 23:22.686
and the disappearance
of Afa Lefiti.

23:24.588 --> 23:26.523
Wait, what'd you call it?

23:29.926 --> 23:32.361
A gift from a brother. Right?

23:32.361 --> 23:34.531
Hideaway motel in Stockton.

23:34.564 --> 23:37.501
Same night Tommy Gaeta
was shot to death.

23:37.534 --> 23:40.003
-Your abdomen...
-Okay, stop.

23:40.036 --> 23:42.371
-Shot...
-Shut up!

23:42.371 --> 23:46.009
We have your whole charter.

23:46.042 --> 23:48.211
The disappearance of
Victoria Ariza.

23:48.211 --> 23:51.214
The murders of Alice
and Dennis Reed.

23:51.214 --> 23:55.852
Joseph "Flaco" Nuñez
and Steven "Chepe" Ramirez,

23:55.885 --> 23:58.522
shot dead driving through
San Bernardino.

23:58.555 --> 24:01.691
Thomas "Doc" Harper,
murdered.

24:01.725 --> 24:05.929
Eric Curry, from Boston,
his nude, murdered body

24:05.962 --> 24:08.031
left at a motel in Fresno.

24:08.064 --> 24:11.568
You want me to keep going?
'Cause there's a lot.

24:11.568 --> 24:14.070
All with your club's
fingerprints on it.

24:15.104 --> 24:16.940
There's a way out, Neron.

24:21.410 --> 24:24.080
I'm not a fucking rat.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.049
It's a well-known secret
in law enforcement

24:26.082 --> 24:28.384
that Santo Padre was
infiltrated.

24:28.417 --> 24:31.420
So one of the brothers
you're trying to protect

24:31.454 --> 24:33.056
is a rat.

24:33.089 --> 24:37.060
-Shut the fuck up. Who?
-I don't know.

24:37.093 --> 24:40.063
But what it means is you're
already late to the table.

24:40.096 --> 24:42.298
So please, let me help you.

24:47.470 --> 24:49.105
Why?

24:52.609 --> 24:54.778
Look, I have...

24:57.446 --> 24:59.282
I am severely fuckin'
compromised,

24:59.315 --> 25:01.450
but I have thought
a lot about it and...

25:05.288 --> 25:09.492
...there is a clear path
through this for us.

25:13.797 --> 25:16.165
You go in, you proffer.

25:16.199 --> 25:19.468
You give us information.

25:19.468 --> 25:21.170
You walk.

25:22.305 --> 25:26.776
We don't want an individual,
we want the club.

25:26.810 --> 25:28.678
Why me?

25:30.146 --> 25:32.148
Because when you said it
the other night,

25:32.181 --> 25:34.350
I feel it.

25:34.383 --> 25:36.152
I feel it, too.

25:38.888 --> 25:40.489
(exhales sharply)

25:41.490 --> 25:44.327
No.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.830
Why'd you come after me?

25:50.166 --> 25:54.170
Obispo Losa's too unhinged.

25:54.203 --> 25:57.240
Che Romero, too old.

26:00.877 --> 26:03.346
Hank Loza, too bound to
the one-percenter code.

26:03.346 --> 26:05.849
(sighs)

26:05.849 --> 26:07.651
Lopez, with his military
background, you know,

26:07.684 --> 26:10.687
we just couldn't be too sure.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.158
Johnny Cruz,
an unreliable junkie.

26:15.191 --> 26:19.663
And the Reyes brothers, uh...

26:19.696 --> 26:22.732
we knew we couldn't flip them
on each other, so...

26:26.569 --> 26:28.705
...then there was you.

26:30.707 --> 26:32.441
Isolated.

26:34.377 --> 26:36.612
Vulnerable.

26:38.748 --> 26:42.551
You were identified as
the softest target.

26:44.921 --> 26:46.389
(scoffs)

26:52.228 --> 26:55.264
But, Neron...

26:58.634 --> 27:00.136
...there's a way out.

27:09.412 --> 27:11.414
(car alarm blaring)

27:25.428 --> 27:27.330
-(door opens)
-LETICIA: Hope?

27:32.601 --> 27:33.970
What the fuck do you want?

27:36.605 --> 27:37.807
I, um...

27:39.275 --> 27:40.977
I didn't get to talk to you
after the service.

27:41.010 --> 27:42.611
You know, you left so quick.

27:43.813 --> 27:45.314
Just came by to tell you
that I'm sorry about

27:45.348 --> 27:47.450
your bro... uh, your dad.

27:49.518 --> 27:51.420
I-I really loved Coco,
you know?

27:51.454 --> 27:53.857
Sucks to see everything
that he went through.

27:55.124 --> 27:57.761
Especially now, you know, when
he's getting his shit together.

27:57.794 --> 27:59.662
-I mean, he got his...
-What do you want, Louie?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.135
Do you... do you know
I have a daughter?

28:06.169 --> 28:07.636
Really?

28:09.305 --> 28:11.307
Are you gonna put her
in porn, too?

28:11.307 --> 28:13.642
She's not gonna grow up
to be no whor...

28:16.312 --> 28:18.815
It's just that...

28:18.848 --> 28:21.317
if something happened to me,

28:21.317 --> 28:23.386
I'd want her to know that...

28:24.854 --> 28:26.289
...that I loved her,

28:26.322 --> 28:28.324
the way that Coco loved you.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.328
Yeah.

28:33.729 --> 28:35.631
Even when
he was stealing my shit

28:35.664 --> 28:37.000
to give it to you for drugs?

28:38.001 --> 28:40.837
I-I mean, that right there shows
how bad the dope got him, right?

28:40.837 --> 28:42.505
That he hurt you.

28:44.908 --> 28:46.342
He was proud of you.

28:49.345 --> 28:51.380
He'd want you to have that.

28:52.882 --> 28:53.983
What the fuck is that?

28:54.017 --> 28:56.219
That's, uh, Coco's Nova.

28:56.252 --> 28:57.686
Why is it green?

28:57.686 --> 29:00.689
No. (chuckles)
It's, uh, chartreuse.

29:00.723 --> 29:03.026
It's fucking ugly-ass
puke green.

29:03.059 --> 29:07.030
Well, it's your ugly-ass
puke green car now.

29:08.031 --> 29:10.066
-What?
-He gave it to me

29:10.099 --> 29:12.535
'cause of a debt that he owed,
and, um...

29:12.535 --> 29:14.037
(keys jingle)

29:14.037 --> 29:15.872
I don't know, I just...

29:15.905 --> 29:18.707
I don't feel right
holding on to it anymore, so...

29:25.581 --> 29:28.284
Uh... take care, Letty.

29:38.094 --> 29:39.395
Louie.

29:41.630 --> 29:43.432
Yeah?

29:44.968 --> 29:46.402
Thank you.

29:46.435 --> 29:48.104
Don't mention it.

30:05.421 --> 30:07.423
Don't be scared.

30:08.491 --> 30:11.794
I'm not getting you a sidecar.
Trust me, you'll see.

30:13.096 --> 30:15.264
You'll see, you're just--
you're alive.

30:16.332 --> 30:17.600
You're free.

30:19.802 --> 30:22.171
It's the greatest
feeling in the world.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.642
(laughs) Okay. Yeah, okay.

30:26.675 --> 30:29.112
It's the second greatest feeling
in the world.

30:35.118 --> 30:36.419
Hey, I got to go.

30:36.452 --> 30:38.287
I'm gonna pick you up,
all right?

30:38.321 --> 30:39.855
You're gonna love it.
All right.

30:43.626 --> 30:45.294
Everything good?

30:46.829 --> 30:48.965
I had a meeting this morning,

30:48.965 --> 30:51.467
-in Los Angeles.
-L.A.?

30:51.467 --> 30:53.502
Halfway between
here and Charming.

30:55.138 --> 30:58.474
Met with an old friend about
putting an end to this war.

31:03.712 --> 31:05.481
And Coco?

31:05.481 --> 31:07.516
We've lost too many Cocos
on both sides.

31:07.550 --> 31:09.352
There's one Coco.

31:09.385 --> 31:10.653
One side.

31:10.686 --> 31:12.155
And those motherfuckers
shot him down.

31:12.155 --> 31:14.290
Yeah, and we hit them back hard,
didn't we?

31:14.323 --> 31:15.658
When will enough be enough
for you?

31:15.691 --> 31:17.626
When we've run them off
this fucking earth.

31:17.660 --> 31:19.328
I thought you were smart, EZ.

31:19.328 --> 31:21.330
-They outnumber us three to one.
-Good.

31:21.364 --> 31:23.499
More of them to kill.

31:23.499 --> 31:25.834
And one more reason
we need that heroin.

31:26.902 --> 31:28.371
Padrino,

31:28.404 --> 31:30.539
we got to make that deal
with El Banquero's...

31:30.573 --> 31:32.875
I'm tired of
fighting you on this.

31:32.908 --> 31:34.543
You already know
my position on that.

31:34.577 --> 31:36.679
This charter was set up

31:36.679 --> 31:38.681
as the cartel's ally
on the border.

31:39.848 --> 31:41.017
How are you gonna deny

31:41.017 --> 31:43.019
the very thing
you birthed us to be?

31:46.022 --> 31:47.890
Fuck Miguel Galindo.

31:47.923 --> 31:50.726
I got no love for that guy,
but we need that deal.

31:53.929 --> 31:56.099
Remember your promise
to his father?

31:58.401 --> 32:00.903
I've been living for ghosts
too fucking long.

32:02.038 --> 32:03.572
It's time I cut them loose.

32:06.542 --> 32:08.377
It'll kill this charter.

32:11.914 --> 32:14.083
It'll kill the club.

32:15.118 --> 32:16.119
No.

32:17.286 --> 32:19.422
It'll keep you all from dying.

32:22.891 --> 32:24.727
And haunting me as well.

32:28.897 --> 32:30.899
*

32:35.604 --> 32:37.606
(knocking on door)

32:43.746 --> 32:45.281
Go see who that is, yeah?

32:50.819 --> 32:52.821
(takes deep breath)

33:04.333 --> 33:06.469
(door opens)

33:08.271 --> 33:10.306
-(door closes)
-(Treenie sighs)

33:10.339 --> 33:11.640
You got company.

33:22.151 --> 33:24.120
(coughs)

33:44.006 --> 33:45.040
(groans)

33:48.644 --> 33:50.346
(coughs)

33:50.379 --> 33:52.181
(sniffles) Mm.

33:55.151 --> 33:56.785
(sighs)

33:56.819 --> 33:58.321
What the fuck do you want?

33:59.855 --> 34:01.324
I want Alvarez out.

34:15.404 --> 34:17.840
You got some balls
coming to me.

34:18.841 --> 34:20.843
I need you.

34:23.011 --> 34:24.347
We need you.

34:28.184 --> 34:29.585
Back on top.

34:57.613 --> 34:58.714
(exhales)

35:15.398 --> 35:17.400
(whispers):
"Say hello to Mommy and Daddy."

35:19.935 --> 35:22.070
(choking)

35:25.073 --> 35:27.075
*

35:42.291 --> 35:44.293
*

35:54.937 --> 35:56.439
Now...

35:56.472 --> 35:58.441
shall we begin

35:58.441 --> 35:59.975
the future?

36:29.972 --> 36:32.641
(plastic gloves rustling)

36:41.817 --> 36:43.819
(phone ringing)

36:49.992 --> 36:51.727
(gasps softly)

36:53.729 --> 36:55.030
What the hell?

36:55.063 --> 36:56.499
I've been trying you.

36:56.499 --> 36:59.001
Okay, so where are you?
Did you make it?

37:00.235 --> 37:02.237
MIGUEL:
It's time to come home.

37:06.174 --> 37:08.844
For us to be a family again.

37:12.748 --> 37:14.182
Miguel...

37:16.685 --> 37:17.886
Where are you?

37:21.089 --> 37:23.191
How do you have this phone?

37:24.226 --> 37:25.528
-(babbles)
-Say hi to Mommy.

37:25.561 --> 37:26.695
Hi, Mommy.

37:26.729 --> 37:28.731
(Miguel laughs)

37:30.065 --> 37:32.234
(sobs):
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

37:32.267 --> 37:34.102
(sniffles)

37:35.538 --> 37:37.172
So, where are you?

37:37.205 --> 37:38.374
Are you okay?

37:38.407 --> 37:41.209
Baby, can you hear me?

37:41.243 --> 37:43.211
Cristóbal, can you hear me?

37:43.211 --> 37:45.213
It's over, Em.

37:45.247 --> 37:46.782
I forgive you.

37:53.556 --> 37:55.090
What did you do to my sister?

37:57.092 --> 37:59.061
Miguel, talk to me.

37:59.061 --> 38:01.096
Come home, amor.

38:02.565 --> 38:04.733
Come home.

38:05.734 --> 38:06.769
Miguel?

38:08.737 --> 38:10.739
(breathing shakily)

38:17.079 --> 38:19.081
(breathing heavily)

38:25.588 --> 38:27.756
(crying)

38:37.600 --> 38:39.602
(screams)

38:41.437 --> 38:44.940
(plane passing overhead)

38:44.940 --> 38:46.942
(screaming)

38:48.110 --> 38:50.112
*

39:04.126 --> 39:06.128
*

39:19.842 --> 39:21.343
-(gunshot)
-(Sofía gasps)

39:26.381 --> 39:28.216
-(tires screeching)
-(horns honking)

39:30.318 --> 39:31.854
(horn blaring)

39:46.869 --> 39:48.871
(groaning)

39:50.205 --> 39:52.174
(retching)

40:11.026 --> 40:13.028
(Sofía pants)

40:31.780 --> 40:33.616
(groans)

40:35.283 --> 40:37.720
(breathing heavily)

40:37.753 --> 40:39.722
-You are so pretty.
-Fuck you!

40:39.755 --> 40:42.090
Whoa. Why so angry?

40:44.292 --> 40:45.761
Did you just realize?

40:45.794 --> 40:46.929
Huh?

40:46.962 --> 40:50.232
The hours have stopped, huh?

40:50.232 --> 40:53.268
You're down to a minute
or two now.

40:53.301 --> 40:55.938
How many days, months,
years have you wasted?

40:57.072 --> 40:59.808
You had one shot, one life.

41:00.909 --> 41:03.612
And it's gonna end
kneeling in cow shit.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.314
It's over.

41:07.583 --> 41:09.151
But yet, so is the pain.

41:12.621 --> 41:14.923
Well, except one more flash.

41:16.424 --> 41:20.428
One more awful, horrifying
burst into nothingness.

41:21.429 --> 41:22.665
That's the poetry.

41:24.132 --> 41:26.602
You came into this world
screaming, cold,

41:26.602 --> 41:28.804
slick with your mother's blood,

41:28.837 --> 41:31.907
and now you're gonna leave
screaming, hot,

41:31.940 --> 41:34.142
wet with Daddy's gasoline.

41:34.176 --> 41:35.944
Bella, my baby girl,
I love you.

41:35.944 --> 41:39.314
You're the best thing that ever
happened to me. I'm so sorry.

41:40.448 --> 41:41.784
I'm gonna see you again.

41:45.453 --> 41:47.956
-If there's an afterlife...
-There's not.

41:47.990 --> 41:51.694
...I'm going to find you,
and I'm gonna kill you.

41:52.828 --> 41:55.130
For making my baby girl cry.

41:55.130 --> 41:56.865
No, she'll adapt.

41:58.033 --> 42:00.669
Then she'll be strong.

42:00.703 --> 42:03.138
Your memory just a raised scar

42:03.171 --> 42:05.473
for curious boys to trace
with their fingers.

42:05.507 --> 42:07.309
This moment...

42:07.342 --> 42:10.012
(whispering):
a whispered anecdote.

42:12.147 --> 42:14.482
"This is my trauma.

42:14.516 --> 42:16.652
"Love me, please.

42:17.986 --> 42:19.554
Please love me."

42:22.991 --> 42:24.492
(exhales sharply)

42:26.328 --> 42:28.330
Oh, man.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.498
-OTERO: (scoffs) Motherfucker.
-Oh, man.

42:30.498 --> 42:32.868
-(panting)
-(lighter flicks)

42:32.901 --> 42:35.070
(laughs)

42:37.372 --> 42:40.375
This is gonna make her
so interesting.

42:42.577 --> 42:45.147
No, no. No. No! No!

42:45.180 --> 42:47.082
(screaming)

42:50.686 --> 42:52.688
(screaming)

42:57.860 --> 42:59.494
Fuck.

42:59.527 --> 43:01.229
Do you want to die?

43:01.263 --> 43:03.565
Fuck you, motherfucker!

43:03.598 --> 43:06.034
Do you want to die?

43:06.068 --> 43:08.704
(breathing heavily) No.

43:09.705 --> 43:14.209
Then you get to be
my little Judas wolf.

43:14.242 --> 43:17.846
You go back to your den
and you warn them:

43:17.880 --> 43:21.049
the fire is coming.

43:22.217 --> 43:23.886
Yeah.

43:26.889 --> 43:28.390
Come on.

43:28.423 --> 43:31.059
* Middle class, chemical

43:31.059 --> 43:33.395
* In a bag

43:33.428 --> 43:35.397
* All I want

43:35.397 --> 43:39.067
* Love me all the time

43:40.803 --> 43:43.739
* Enough is never enough

43:43.739 --> 43:45.874
* I won't talk

43:45.908 --> 43:47.910
* If you pull me up

43:47.910 --> 43:50.045
-* And collect
-(lighter flicks)

43:50.078 --> 43:53.481
* My blood inside a cup...

43:55.818 --> 43:57.820
(song continues faintly)

44:19.141 --> 44:21.343
Here, let me help you.

44:23.478 --> 44:26.014
-It's been a while.
-No stress.

44:27.315 --> 44:29.284
Do you want me to do it?

44:36.291 --> 44:38.293
*

44:48.336 --> 44:50.705
-(vehicle approaching)
-Oh, shit. Five-O.

44:52.808 --> 44:54.376
-(groaning)
-Be cool.

44:57.679 --> 44:59.047
(music stops)

45:04.486 --> 45:06.354
LETICIA:
Hope, get in the car.

45:06.388 --> 45:08.656
Get in the fucking car, Hope.

45:12.861 --> 45:14.662
You need to come with me.

45:14.662 --> 45:16.631
Fuck off.
She don't want to go.

45:16.664 --> 45:19.501
I'll stab your fucking throat.
Stay out of this.

45:20.836 --> 45:22.204
You think that after all this,

45:22.237 --> 45:24.206
you're just gonna
abandon me, too?

45:24.239 --> 45:26.641
That's not fucking happening.

45:26.674 --> 45:29.744
Coco wouldn't want you out here.

45:32.180 --> 45:35.183
And I don't want you out here.

45:46.028 --> 45:47.362
Are you sure?

45:50.565 --> 45:51.867
HOPE:
I'm gonna go.

45:57.772 --> 45:59.407
Home.

46:01.709 --> 46:03.711
(music resumes playing faintly)

46:06.248 --> 46:08.750
Y'all need to
take a fucking bath.

46:08.783 --> 46:10.518
Yo, get the fuck out of here,

46:10.552 --> 46:12.855
with your "baby shit" green car.

46:12.888 --> 46:15.723
It's chartreuse, bitch.

46:26.601 --> 46:31.073
When I first met you,
I knew that was it.

46:32.574 --> 46:34.742
That never changed.

46:37.312 --> 46:39.414
Whenever I'd look in your eyes,

46:39.414 --> 46:42.417
no matter how crowded
the room...

46:42.450 --> 46:45.087
the world would disappear.

46:49.157 --> 46:50.758
This was our dream.

46:53.962 --> 46:56.764
But now,
like so many other things,

46:56.798 --> 46:58.666
it's over.

47:01.769 --> 47:04.439
I know how lucky I was...

47:05.607 --> 47:08.977
...to ever have known any of it,
and I know...

47:10.612 --> 47:13.281
...how much I didn't deserve
any of it.

47:15.283 --> 47:17.185
I didn't deserve you.

47:21.156 --> 47:23.959
I can't think of
anything more cruel...

47:26.794 --> 47:28.463
...than to...

47:30.465 --> 47:32.800
...have known heaven.

47:34.802 --> 47:38.840
Then be dragged back into the...

47:48.516 --> 47:50.852
(takes deep breath)

47:55.991 --> 47:58.160
Were you talking to her?

47:59.661 --> 48:01.163
Your dead wife?

48:06.034 --> 48:09.637
You dwell on the dead too long,

48:09.671 --> 48:11.839
they take you with them.

48:14.042 --> 48:15.677
I guess...

48:17.579 --> 48:20.682
...we have that in common,
you and I.

48:23.051 --> 48:27.189
Women we love having been...

48:27.189 --> 48:28.756
brutally murdered.

48:38.233 --> 48:40.402
You're not gonna correct me?

48:40.435 --> 48:42.704
Say it was suicide?

48:45.873 --> 48:47.209
Hmm.

48:52.880 --> 48:56.051
They ever find
who killed your wife?

49:01.956 --> 49:05.393
At least I have that. (scoffs)

49:08.063 --> 49:09.564
The, uh...

49:11.633 --> 49:13.401
...satisfaction...

49:14.936 --> 49:17.639
...of facing the bastard
who murdered my mother.

49:20.108 --> 49:22.577
Getting to ask him why.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.748
Why'd you do it?

49:31.753 --> 49:35.223
How'd you wrap my wife
into this?

49:35.257 --> 49:37.592
How did you turn her against me?

49:40.262 --> 49:43.631
Emily had nothing to do
with this.

49:44.632 --> 49:46.901
Hmm.

49:46.934 --> 49:50.105
I did this alone.

49:50.105 --> 49:52.774
I killed your mother.

49:53.808 --> 49:56.144
How?

49:57.179 --> 49:58.946
I strangled her.

50:00.448 --> 50:02.684
Then I set her body on fire.

50:09.157 --> 50:10.792
Why?

50:10.825 --> 50:13.128
I can't give you a reason

50:13.128 --> 50:15.797
that would make
any sense to you.

50:19.467 --> 50:23.305
Son, I did it.

50:24.372 --> 50:26.208
And I'm sorry.

50:27.642 --> 50:28.976
Thank you.

50:30.978 --> 50:32.680
For telling me the truth.

50:34.216 --> 50:38.386
At least a piece of it.

50:40.488 --> 50:41.989
You see...

50:44.492 --> 50:47.329
...there were motorcycle tracks
left at the scene.

50:48.563 --> 50:50.165
Two sets.

50:50.165 --> 50:54.236
I believe you were there, but...

50:56.371 --> 50:59.241
...I know your sons were, too.

51:00.508 --> 51:03.178
You were my mother's
security detail.

51:04.346 --> 51:07.749
I heard the way
you spoke about her.

51:08.850 --> 51:10.918
I bet you couldn't do it.

51:13.921 --> 51:16.524
I bet you they did.

51:16.558 --> 51:19.026
See, I can't bring her back.

51:20.362 --> 51:25.400
But I can let your sons know
what it's like to be orphaned,

51:25.433 --> 51:27.335
and let you leave this earth

51:27.369 --> 51:30.037
knowing your sons
will join you soon.

51:30.037 --> 51:32.340
Kill me,

51:32.374 --> 51:34.709
if that's what you want.

51:38.380 --> 51:40.248
I owe you that.

51:41.583 --> 51:44.686
But you can't hurt
Angel and EZ.

51:44.719 --> 51:46.554
I can.

51:47.622 --> 51:50.892
Why would I show you mercy...

51:52.394 --> 51:54.729
...when you didn't show
any to my mother?

51:56.398 --> 51:58.766
Why would I show mercy

51:58.800 --> 52:02.404
to the people
who set her body on fire?

52:02.437 --> 52:05.907
-Who destroyed my family?
-Because...

52:07.409 --> 52:10.645
...they are your family.

52:13.248 --> 52:16.951
We are your family, son.

52:26.761 --> 52:28.763
*

52:44.111 --> 52:46.648
You okay, EZ?

52:46.681 --> 52:48.850
We need to murder
these motherfuckers.

52:49.951 --> 52:52.320
MARCUS:
Just got off the phone
with Charming.

52:52.354 --> 52:54.956
What happened wasn't sanctioned.

52:54.956 --> 52:56.991
They have a contingent
that's gone rogue.

52:57.024 --> 52:59.126
They came at a VP, Padrino,

52:59.126 --> 53:01.329
-and his girl.
-MARCUS: I'm aware of that.

53:01.363 --> 53:04.332
Earlier today I had a sit-down
with an old friend of mine,

53:04.366 --> 53:07.469
trying to figure out how
we could stop this bloodshed.

53:09.036 --> 53:12.274
He told me some disturbing
things about our own ranks.

53:12.307 --> 53:14.108
-About Santo Pad...
-GILLY: Who the fuck
asked you to go?

53:14.141 --> 53:15.943
Who the fuck asked for peace?

53:15.977 --> 53:16.978
Yo, let him talk, bro.

53:17.011 --> 53:19.013
I'm tired of fucking talk.

53:19.046 --> 53:20.482
Everyone wants to fucking talk,

53:20.482 --> 53:22.817
but talk doesn't get shit done.

53:23.851 --> 53:25.820
MARCUS:
In my conversation
with Chibs right now,

53:25.853 --> 53:27.789
SAMCRO has agreed for peace

53:27.822 --> 53:29.857
between Sons of Anarchy
and Mayans.

53:29.891 --> 53:32.026
GILLY:
You think Coco would want peace?

53:32.059 --> 53:35.563
EZ, what do you want?

53:36.664 --> 53:38.666
What are the conditions
for their surrender?

53:38.666 --> 53:41.235
It's a cease-fire,
not a surrender.

53:43.170 --> 53:45.507
I won't accept anything
but complete surrender.

53:47.709 --> 53:49.344
And if you will, Padrino...

53:50.712 --> 53:52.347
...I want you out.

53:55.182 --> 53:57.585
I call for a killswitch.

54:01.723 --> 54:03.558
You sure you want to do this?

54:09.063 --> 54:11.566
A killswitch is
from our original bylaws.

54:14.201 --> 54:16.871
It states that
a president can be removed

54:16.871 --> 54:18.773
by unanimous vote
from the chapter.

54:20.207 --> 54:22.209
You have two choices.

54:24.746 --> 54:26.348
You can vote to keep Padrino

54:26.381 --> 54:28.550
and his quest for peace,

54:28.583 --> 54:31.586
his desire to go back
and kneel...

54:33.054 --> 54:35.790
...under the shadow of the Sons.

54:39.293 --> 54:42.063
Or vote for the soul
of our club.

54:44.932 --> 54:46.801
Vote for war.

54:55.477 --> 54:57.579
Is there anything
you want to say, Marcus?

54:57.612 --> 54:59.614
*

55:06.421 --> 55:08.923
Everybody knows me here.

55:08.923 --> 55:11.125
I stand by my reputation.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.596
Have your vote.

55:25.172 --> 55:26.808
I vote for war.

55:28.175 --> 55:29.611
I vote war.

55:33.615 --> 55:35.316
I love you, Padrino.

55:37.952 --> 55:39.320
But I vote war.

55:44.459 --> 55:46.494
Angel.

55:51.032 --> 55:52.867
They went after
your fucking brother.

55:59.841 --> 56:01.275
War.

56:01.308 --> 56:02.977
What about you, Hank?

56:09.150 --> 56:11.819
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, Padrino.

56:13.154 --> 56:14.989
I wouldn't be here.

56:16.057 --> 56:18.493
You brought me in.

56:18.493 --> 56:20.061
Taught me everything I know.

56:24.732 --> 56:26.400
But I vote for war.

56:29.837 --> 56:31.506
Primo.

56:32.507 --> 56:35.643
I hope our relationship...

56:35.677 --> 56:37.679
is deeper than this club, primo.

56:40.748 --> 56:42.650
I vote for war.

56:42.684 --> 56:44.686
*

56:49.591 --> 56:51.826
(stubs out cigarette)

56:51.859 --> 56:54.061
MARCUS:
I've given my life to this club.

56:54.095 --> 56:58.099
I sacrificed my legacy
to save this poisoned charter.

57:00.101 --> 57:04.205
What you call peace,
like it's a dirty word,

57:04.238 --> 57:06.440
was me fighting
to keep you all safe.

57:07.441 --> 57:11.078
I guess the only thing
I couldn't protect you from...

57:11.112 --> 57:13.047
was yourselves.

57:15.550 --> 57:17.885
I built this club!

57:27.261 --> 57:29.263
*

57:37.138 --> 57:39.607
And I'm happy...

57:39.641 --> 57:42.076
I won't be here to see it burn.

58:07.669 --> 58:09.671
*

58:17.945 --> 58:19.647
Bishop.

58:23.150 --> 58:25.452
You were unfairly stripped.

58:25.452 --> 58:30.291
Everyone in this templo
knows the leader...

58:30.324 --> 58:31.959
you are.

58:34.996 --> 58:37.031
So...

58:39.133 --> 58:42.036
I want to make you my VP.

58:44.972 --> 58:46.974
I want you by my side...

58:49.343 --> 58:51.613
...to help guide me

58:51.646 --> 58:53.981
through this next
difficult phase.

59:10.698 --> 59:11.999
(EZ sighs)

59:11.999 --> 59:13.668
Now...

59:18.339 --> 59:20.174
...to business.

59:26.180 --> 59:28.750
The individual has been
our biggest threat.

59:30.051 --> 59:32.519
It's lone men who've brought us
close to destruction.

59:35.022 --> 59:37.892
Our strength lies
in our devotion to the nation.

59:41.362 --> 59:44.732
Our ability to sacrifice
ourselves to this machine.

59:46.868 --> 59:49.203
As a nation,

59:49.203 --> 59:51.038
as a machine...

59:52.439 --> 59:55.042
...we will no longer
allow others to divide us.

59:56.043 --> 1:00:00.347
No more Northern Cali,
Southern Cali.

1:00:00.381 --> 1:00:02.416
We are now California.

1:00:03.550 --> 1:00:07.054
And with that warehouse full
of heroin as our war chest,

1:00:07.054 --> 1:00:09.223
the prisons will become ours.

1:00:10.291 --> 1:00:12.259
The streets will become ours.

1:00:13.895 --> 1:00:15.562
This is our state.

1:00:17.064 --> 1:00:18.465
Our nation.

1:00:22.403 --> 1:00:24.071
Our world.

1:00:25.406 --> 1:00:27.709
You can either join us,

1:00:27.742 --> 1:00:30.411
kneel to us,

1:00:30.411 --> 1:00:32.113
or be crushed by us.

1:00:34.949 --> 1:00:37.151
Know this, as your president...

1:00:39.921 --> 1:00:42.757
...if you bleed,
I will bleed by your side.

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:46.928
If you tire, I will carry you.

1:00:46.961 --> 1:00:49.764
I will carry this club
on my back.

1:00:49.764 --> 1:00:51.766
I will lift us to greatness.

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:57.171
Tonight, a new day rises.

1:00:58.605 --> 1:01:00.607
A new chapter begins.

1:01:01.943 --> 1:01:03.945
Every man for himself.

1:01:05.646 --> 1:01:07.849
And Mayans against all.

1:01:16.791 --> 1:01:19.293
(pounding continues)

1:01:34.641 --> 1:01:36.643
*

1:01:40.982 --> 1:01:42.984
(engine idling)

1:01:48.555 --> 1:01:50.324
(engine turns off)

1:02:10.244 --> 1:02:12.246
*

1:02:27.361 --> 1:02:29.363
*

1:02:46.380 --> 1:02:47.949
(door whirring)

1:02:59.894 --> 1:03:01.896
EZ!

1:03:01.929 --> 1:03:03.630
Come here, babe.

1:03:08.903 --> 1:03:10.237
EZ's not here.

1:03:10.237 --> 1:03:11.939
I need to talk to him.

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:16.243
I just told you,
he ain't here.

1:03:17.278 --> 1:03:18.779
He was supposed to meet
with my husband last night,

1:03:18.812 --> 1:03:19.914
but he never came home.

1:03:21.916 --> 1:03:23.384
I don't know what to tell you.

1:03:23.417 --> 1:03:25.252
I don't need you
to tell me shit.

1:03:25.286 --> 1:03:28.089
I need EZ to tell me
where Jay-Jay is!

1:03:29.423 --> 1:03:30.925
I got to go to work.

1:03:30.958 --> 1:03:33.294
What am I supposed to do
with my girls?

1:03:35.096 --> 1:03:36.730
I miss a shift, I get fired.

1:03:36.763 --> 1:03:38.933
That ain't EZ's problem.

1:03:44.271 --> 1:03:45.940
You a mother?

1:03:51.178 --> 1:03:52.779
No.

1:03:52.779 --> 1:03:55.482
Then you don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

1:04:06.994 --> 1:04:09.463
I know EZ was with me
last night.

1:04:10.631 --> 1:04:12.833
So he never met up
with your man.

1:04:16.637 --> 1:04:18.805
Look, I need him to come home.

1:04:20.307 --> 1:04:23.677
I need him to be okay.
Something's wrong.

1:04:25.479 --> 1:04:27.148
I can feel it.

1:04:28.882 --> 1:04:30.817
(whispers):
Something's wrong.

1:04:35.990 --> 1:04:37.491
EZ was with me.

1:04:39.026 --> 1:04:40.361
All night.

1:04:43.230 --> 1:04:44.665
Please.

1:04:49.503 --> 1:04:51.172
I'm sorry.

1:04:55.076 --> 1:04:56.910
-(door closes)
-Fuck.

1:05:01.082 --> 1:05:03.684
(rock music playing faintly)

1:05:33.714 --> 1:05:35.582
(Angel sighs)

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.062
What are you doing?

1:05:53.234 --> 1:05:55.302
How much of...

1:05:56.770 --> 1:06:00.107
...this killswitch,

1:06:00.141 --> 1:06:02.743
Bishop, was your plan?

1:06:04.578 --> 1:06:07.648
I'm doing for the M.C.
what it can't do for itself.

1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:16.090
You should see that warehouse,
Angel.

1:06:16.123 --> 1:06:18.992
Heroin from floor to ceiling.
Millions of dollars.

1:06:20.427 --> 1:06:22.763
And that's our future.

1:06:22.763 --> 1:06:24.631
That's our legacy.

1:06:24.665 --> 1:06:28.135
The deal puts us
back in bed with Galindo.

1:06:28.169 --> 1:06:29.670
Fuck Galindo, bro.

1:06:31.438 --> 1:06:32.473
He'll get his soon.

1:06:32.506 --> 1:06:34.641
The fuck is wrong with you, bro?

1:06:35.942 --> 1:06:38.445
How many bodies
you gonna stand on

1:06:38.445 --> 1:06:41.248
till you realize
there ain't nobody fucking left?

1:06:41.282 --> 1:06:42.816
Man... (scoffs)

1:06:44.785 --> 1:06:48.655
Ever since Gabby, I feel like...

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:52.859
I feel like
I don't know who you are.

1:06:58.165 --> 1:07:00.201
Remember when we were little?

1:07:02.035 --> 1:07:04.371
Our dog Freya got hit
by that car, you remember that?

1:07:06.473 --> 1:07:08.142
You just stood there.

1:07:09.976 --> 1:07:11.445
You didn't cry at all,
you just...

1:07:11.478 --> 1:07:12.979
I broke her neck.

1:07:16.817 --> 1:07:19.820
She was in so much pain,
I had to.

1:07:26.227 --> 1:07:27.828
I loved her.

1:07:31.832 --> 1:07:34.000
So, no, I didn't get to cry.

1:07:35.068 --> 1:07:37.204
I did for her
what no one else would.

1:07:42.709 --> 1:07:44.845
That's who I am, Angel.

1:07:46.247 --> 1:07:48.849
That's who I've always been.

1:07:52.686 --> 1:07:54.188
I love you, Angel.

1:07:56.757 --> 1:07:58.659
And I need you.

1:07:58.692 --> 1:08:00.761
Sangre es sangre.

1:08:01.862 --> 1:08:04.431
But I need to know
you're all in.

1:08:07.534 --> 1:08:09.436
If you're not down...

1:08:11.405 --> 1:08:14.040
...if you are not
on this train...

1:08:16.777 --> 1:08:18.379
...please walk away.

1:08:20.381 --> 1:08:22.583
Or it'll run right over you.

1:08:27.388 --> 1:08:28.889
Is that a threat?

1:08:55.482 --> 1:08:57.484
(rock music playing faintly)

1:09:11.465 --> 1:09:13.434
-(door closes)
-(music fades)

1:09:17.304 --> 1:09:18.939
He's been in here an hour.
He said he won't talk

1:09:18.939 --> 1:09:20.607
unless you're in the room.

1:09:24.645 --> 1:09:27.147
Hey, are you ready for this?

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:28.782
Yeah.

1:09:28.782 --> 1:09:30.617
You did good, Katie.

1:09:30.617 --> 1:09:32.286
I'm proud of you.

1:09:32.319 --> 1:09:33.920
This is huge.

1:09:33.954 --> 1:09:35.456
(door opens)

1:09:47.534 --> 1:09:49.470
State your name
for the record, please.

1:09:51.305 --> 1:09:53.674
Neron Vargas.

1:09:53.707 --> 1:09:55.809
Mr. Vargas,
you're here to provide intel

1:09:55.809 --> 1:09:58.144
on the Mayans motorcycle club,
correct?

1:10:00.213 --> 1:10:01.648
I am.

1:10:06.553 --> 1:10:08.622
We're gonna take care of you,
Neron.

1:10:08.655 --> 1:10:09.956
LYDECKER:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Vargas.

1:10:09.990 --> 1:10:11.492
Do you want an attorney?

1:10:11.492 --> 1:10:13.327
The proffer process
can be complicated,

1:10:13.327 --> 1:10:15.629
and you may want someone
to help you navigate.

1:10:15.662 --> 1:10:18.665
-What we promise here to...
-I'm-I'm good.

1:10:27.341 --> 1:10:29.175
I don't need anyone.

1:10:32.178 --> 1:10:33.847
LYDECKER:
Where should we begin?

1:10:37.217 --> 1:10:40.721
I shot and killed nine people
in Nunez Park.

1:10:42.356 --> 1:10:45.592
And what other members
of the Mayans were you with?

1:10:48.695 --> 1:10:50.030
None.

1:10:52.366 --> 1:10:55.736
The club had no participation
or knowledge.

1:10:55.769 --> 1:10:58.705
I killed those people myself.

1:10:59.873 --> 1:11:03.043
I killed Dennis and Alice Reed

1:11:03.076 --> 1:11:05.045
in Santo Padre.

1:11:06.947 --> 1:11:11.918
I killed Tommy Gaeta
in Stockton, California.

1:11:11.952 --> 1:11:13.920
Neron.

1:11:13.954 --> 1:11:15.722
Neron, what are you doing?

1:11:16.723 --> 1:11:20.060
You're saying
you did all this yourself?

1:11:24.130 --> 1:11:25.599
That's right.

1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:30.737
No one in the club was involved.

1:11:33.239 --> 1:11:35.075
I murdered Eric Curry.

1:11:36.810 --> 1:11:39.145
In a motel room in Fresno.

1:11:43.584 --> 1:11:45.586
Without the knowledge

1:11:45.619 --> 1:11:47.388
or participation of the club.

1:11:47.421 --> 1:11:49.423
KODY:
Neron, stop.

1:11:50.824 --> 1:11:53.927
-These are my crimes.
-KODY: Stop.

1:11:54.961 --> 1:11:56.763
No one else's.

1:11:59.633 --> 1:12:02.135
And I fully confess.

1:12:03.336 --> 1:12:05.572
I killed Flaco and Chepe.

1:12:05.606 --> 1:12:07.240
Please stop.

1:12:07.273 --> 1:12:10.777
I shot them as they were driving
through San Bernardino,

1:12:10.811 --> 1:12:14.481
without the knowledge

1:12:14.515 --> 1:12:17.283
or participation of my club.

1:12:22.122 --> 1:12:26.292
* This world's not meant
for me *

1:12:30.330 --> 1:12:34.300
* This world's not meant
for me *

1:12:36.302 --> 1:12:40.306
* Till our bodies go back

1:12:40.306 --> 1:12:42.809
* To the water

1:12:44.545 --> 1:12:47.948
* Till the fire burns

1:12:47.981 --> 1:12:50.851
* To the sea

1:12:52.318 --> 1:12:56.657
* Till our bodies go back

1:12:56.690 --> 1:12:59.325
* To the water

1:13:00.527 --> 1:13:04.164
* Till the fire burns

1:13:04.164 --> 1:13:06.533
* To the sea

1:13:08.669 --> 1:13:12.706

1:13:12.739 --> 1:13:15.075

1:13:20.547 --> 1:13:23.517

1:13:37.531 --> 1:13:39.533

1:13:58.251 --> 1:14:02.288
* This world's not meant
for me *

1:14:06.126 --> 1:14:10.396
* This world's not meant
for me *

1:14:14.067 --> 1:14:18.572
* This world's not meant
for me *

1:14:21.742 --> 1:14:25.278
* This world's not meant for.
