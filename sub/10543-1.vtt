00:04.120 --> 00:05.917
<i>In the name of Allah, the merciful.</i>

00:06.122 --> 00:08.682
<i>All praises due to Allah,</i>
<i>Lord of all worlds.</i>

00:08.958 --> 00:10.858
<i>The one God to whom praise</i>
<i>is due forever.</i>

00:11.061 --> 00:13.825
<i>The one who came to us in the person</i>
<i>of Fard Muhammad...</i>

00:14.030 --> 00:17.557
<i>...and raised up the Honorable</i>
<i>Elijah Muhammad. Amen.</i>

00:20.303 --> 00:21.964
<i>How do you feel?</i>

00:22.305 --> 00:24.603
-<i>Who do we want to hear?</i>
-Malcolm X!

00:24.808 --> 00:26.901
<i>Are we gonna bring him on?</i>

00:27.143 --> 00:28.906
<i>Yes, we gonna bring him on.</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.842
<i>Let us hear from our minister,</i>
<i>Mr. Malcolm X!</i>

00:32.048 --> 00:35.279
<i>Let us bring him on with</i>
<i>a round of applause.</i>

00:42.425 --> 00:45.724
<i>I'm here to tell you that</i>
<i>I charge the white man.</i>

00:45.929 --> 00:49.660
<i>I charge the white man with being</i>
<i>the greatest murderer on earth.</i>

00:49.933 --> 00:54.097
<i>I charge the white man with being</i>
<i>the greatest kidnapper on earth.</i>

00:54.337 --> 00:57.602
<i>There's no place in this world that</i>
<i>that man can go...</i>

00:57.941 --> 01:01.274
<i>...and say he created peace</i>
<i>and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...</i>

01:01.611 --> 01:02.942
<i>...he's created havoc.</i>

01:03.179 --> 01:06.171
<i>Everywhere he's gone,</i>
<i>he's created destruction.</i>

01:06.449 --> 01:10.613
<i>So I charge him with being</i>
<i>the greatest kidnapper on this earth!</i>

01:10.854 --> 01:13.948
<i>I charge him with being the greatest</i>
<i>murderer on this earth!</i>

01:14.190 --> 01:18.456
<i>I charge him with being the greatest</i>
<i>robber and enslaver on this earth!</i>

01:18.695 --> 01:20.390
<i>I charge the white man...</i>

01:20.597 --> 01:25.034
<i>...with being the greatest swine-eater</i>
<i>and drunkard on this earth!</i>

01:25.301 --> 01:27.394
<i>He can't deny the charges.</i>

01:27.604 --> 01:31.700
<i>You can't deny the charges!</i>
<i>We're the living proof of those charges!</i>

01:31.975 --> 01:34.000
<i>You and I are the proof.</i>

01:34.944 --> 01:38.141
<i>You're not an American.</i>
<i>You are the victim of America!</i>

01:38.381 --> 01:41.214
<i>You didn't have a choice coming here.</i>
<i>He didn't say:</i>

01:41.484 --> 01:45.215
<i>"Black man, black woman, come over</i>
<i>and help me build America. "</i>

01:45.488 --> 01:47.718
<i>He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.</i>

01:47.991 --> 01:51.324
<i>I'm taking you over there to help me</i>
<i>build America. "</i>

01:52.495 --> 01:55.225
<i>Being born here</i>
<i>does not make you an American.</i>

01:55.498 --> 02:00.299
<i>You and I are not American. You're one</i>
<i>of the 22 million black people...</i>

02:01.104 --> 02:05.973
<i>...who are victims of America.</i>
<i>You and I, we've never seen democracy.</i>

02:06.242 --> 02:10.906
<i>There's no democracy in the fields</i>
<i>of Georgia. No democracy down there.</i>

02:11.748 --> 02:16.685
<i>We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,</i>
<i>Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.</i>

02:16.953 --> 02:20.218
<i>Ain't no democracy there.</i>
<i>We've never seen democracy.</i>

02:21.691 --> 02:23.750
<i>All we've seen is hypocrisy.</i>

02:25.261 --> 02:27.422
<i>We don't see any American dream.</i>

02:28.198 --> 02:31.258
<i>We've experienced only</i>
<i>the American nightmare.</i>

See that spot?
Get it. The spot!

03:36.165 --> 03:38.156
All right, that's it.

04:19.142 --> 04:20.267
Hey, Cholly!

04:20.476 --> 04:24.242
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

04:24.447 --> 04:28.611
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

04:29.385 --> 04:30.352
3-8-4.

04:30.553 --> 04:32.453
You said Sassy Frassy gave you--

04:32.655 --> 04:33.849
That woman quit me.

04:34.057 --> 04:38.050
After I hit the number, that woman
was no good to me at all.

04:38.728 --> 04:42.596
She said I was cheap because
I wouldn't cop her a diamond ring.

04:42.999 --> 04:47.026
And on top of that,
had the indignation...

04:47.236 --> 04:50.205
...to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

04:51.174 --> 04:53.233
...a cheap, black son of a bitch.

04:54.410 --> 04:55.308
Where's homeboy?

04:55.912 --> 04:57.402
Hey, Little.

04:57.747 --> 05:00.011
Your man out here waiting on you.

05:02.251 --> 05:04.242
There he is.

05:05.021 --> 05:07.683
Fixing to get that first conk laid on?

05:08.024 --> 05:09.958
Be hot like hell.

05:10.159 --> 05:11.251
Don't be scared, son.

05:11.461 --> 05:14.157
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

05:14.364 --> 05:16.958
You in the hands of an expert.

05:17.166 --> 05:21.034
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.669
Heckle and Jeckle...

05:23.873 --> 05:26.671
...don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

05:27.010 --> 05:29.979
-Get his forehead and eyebrows.
-Who's doing this?

05:30.179 --> 05:31.476
You all heard that!

05:32.849 --> 05:36.842
Pull my coat if it stings. This shit
can burn a hole through cement.

05:37.053 --> 05:38.042
Hold tight.

05:38.454 --> 05:41.116
I thought you said
this would sting, Shorty.

05:42.058 --> 05:43.150
This ain't nothing.

05:43.359 --> 05:45.190
-Feel good, don't it?
-Real good?

05:45.395 --> 05:46.862
Yeah, it's all right.

05:47.063 --> 05:48.291
You'll feel better.

05:48.498 --> 05:50.659
It is heating up a bit.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.859
It's starting to heat up.

05:53.069 --> 05:54.001
It's okay.

05:54.203 --> 05:55.670
Feeling better, ain't it?

05:55.872 --> 05:58.466
-Just hold on.
-I'm holding, but it's heating.

05:58.674 --> 06:00.642
Gotta make it straight.

06:01.044 --> 06:03.069
That's what he told me too.

06:04.247 --> 06:06.807
I gotta get this out now.
It's starting--

06:08.251 --> 06:11.277
-Hold on.
-I'm holding, I'm holding.

06:13.890 --> 06:14.788
Give me a hand!

06:14.991 --> 06:16.253
Help me out! Hold him!

06:17.226 --> 06:18.921
We're going to the sink!

06:19.128 --> 06:20.891
I got to get up! I got to get up!

06:21.097 --> 06:22.564
-Cool it!
-Put water on it!

06:22.765 --> 06:23.732
More water!

06:23.933 --> 06:25.992
You're getting it in my eye!

06:26.669 --> 06:29.399
-How's it feel?
-Like there's no skin on my head!

06:29.605 --> 06:30.833
If you can talk, it's out.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.474
-How does it look?
-Can't tell yet.

06:33.676 --> 06:36.338
Is it straight?
I'm not doing it again.

06:36.779 --> 06:38.610
Let me dry it.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.011
I can tell it's laying down.

06:46.022 --> 06:48.013
Don't take it off yet.

07:04.307 --> 07:05.604
Looks white, don't it?

07:05.808 --> 07:06.866
All right!

07:07.543 --> 07:09.272
Well, all root!

07:09.479 --> 07:10.503
All reet!

07:29.232 --> 07:31.223
Hit the brim with the left.

07:50.753 --> 07:53.153
<i>When my mother was pregnant with me...</i>

07:54.090 --> 07:58.186
<i>...a party of Klansmen surrounded</i>
<i>our house in Omaha, Nebraska.</i>

07:58.394 --> 08:02.091
<i>They brandished guns and shouted</i>
<i>for my father to come out.</i>

08:04.800 --> 08:07.564
<i>My pregnant mother went to the door...</i>

08:07.770 --> 08:10.762
<i>...and said that my father was in</i>
<i>Milwaukee, preaching.</i>

08:11.274 --> 08:13.640
<i>They said that good white Christians...</i>

08:13.843 --> 08:17.472
<i>...would not stand for his</i>
<i>troublemaking and to get out of town.</i>

08:36.097 --> 08:39.499
<i>They broke every window with</i>
<i>their rifles before riding away.</i>

08:41.370 --> 08:45.397
<i>They rode off into the moonlight as</i>
<i>suddenly as they had come.</i>

08:46.909 --> 08:51.369
<i>My father was not a frightened Negro,</i>
<i>as most were and many still are today.</i>

08:51.581 --> 08:53.879
<i>He was 6 feet 4 and very strong.</i>

08:54.083 --> 08:55.948
<i>He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...</i>

08:56.152 --> 08:58.552
<i>...that freedom, independence</i>
<i>and self-respect...</i>

08:58.754 --> 09:00.449
<i>...wouldn't be achieved</i>
<i>by Negroes in America.</i>

09:00.656 --> 09:05.593
--The object of building up for
themselves a great nation in Africa.

09:06.095 --> 09:07.119
<i>Therefore...</i>

09:07.330 --> 09:10.993
<i>...black men should leave America and</i>
<i>return to their land of origin.</i>

09:12.935 --> 09:15.563
<i>My father dedicated his life</i>
<i>to his beliefs...</i>

09:15.771 --> 09:18.535
<i>...because four of his six brothers</i>
<i>died violently.</i>

09:18.741 --> 09:21.676
<i>Three killed by white men,</i>
<i>and one lynched.</i>

09:21.944 --> 09:24.174
<i>There were nine children in our family.</i>

09:24.780 --> 09:28.341
<i>My mother was a proud woman, an</i>
<i>educated woman, a strong woman.</i>

09:29.452 --> 09:33.479
<i>She was fair-skinned because her mother</i>
<i>was raped by a white man.</i>

09:33.689 --> 09:37.352
<i>One reason she married my father was</i>
<i>because he was so black.</i>

09:37.727 --> 09:41.993
<i>She hated her complexion and wanted</i>
<i>her children to have some color.</i>

09:42.698 --> 09:47.362
<i>I think this had a profound effect on</i>
<i>me then and on most Negroes today.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:52.668
<i>Because so many of our sisters have been</i>
<i>raped or violated by the white man...</i>

09:52.875 --> 09:56.777
<i>...black men can't wait to get their</i>
<i>hands on the white man's prize:</i>

09:56.979 --> 09:58.640
<i>A white woman.</i>

10:01.050 --> 10:03.644
Africa for the Africans!

10:05.388 --> 10:06.878
Say "Roseland."

10:08.591 --> 10:11.287
Showtime!

10:11.827 --> 10:14.057
Showtime!

10:43.559 --> 10:44.753
Hi, Shorty!

10:46.329 --> 10:47.421
You're too big!

10:47.630 --> 10:48.927
I'm gonna come get you.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.263
Come on, Shorty,
I've gotta dance!

11:08.584 --> 11:10.745
You in charge, boy!

11:13.622 --> 11:15.453
You like what you see, baby?

11:18.527 --> 11:19.357
Get back here!

11:19.562 --> 11:20.654
Go ahead, boy!

11:20.863 --> 11:22.558
Red, save me! Save me!

11:22.765 --> 11:23.595
Gotcha!

11:35.044 --> 11:37.979
Come on, Shorty. I wanna dance again!

13:42.271 --> 13:44.398
Laura sure can go, can't she?

13:44.607 --> 13:46.632
-I gotta go freshen up.
-All right.

13:46.842 --> 13:49.174
-You come on back now.
-All right, Malcolm.

13:49.979 --> 13:52.607
That chick is fine as May wine.

13:52.882 --> 13:56.249
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

13:56.452 --> 13:59.615
She a church girl.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.535
Wanna dance?

14:48.604 --> 14:50.037
So what do they call you?

14:51.173 --> 14:52.162
Red.

14:55.945 --> 14:56.877
I'm Sophia.

14:57.513 --> 14:58.571
How you doing?

14:58.781 --> 15:00.612
Very well, thank you.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.977
I have an idea, Red.

15:05.354 --> 15:08.881
Why don't you take that
little girl home and come on back?

15:16.732 --> 15:18.859
Just walk, baby, don't run.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.670
It'll be here when you get back.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.188
Well, I better not come in.

15:40.389 --> 15:41.981
I'm not stupid.

15:43.058 --> 15:44.047
It's late, baby.

15:44.259 --> 15:47.285
I know where you're going.
I am not a total square.

15:47.496 --> 15:50.863
-I know what's happening--
-I gotta go home. It's late.

15:51.066 --> 15:54.900
I gotta get up early in the morning.
I gotta work tomorrow.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.240
I'll call you tomorrow?

15:59.441 --> 16:00.999
What for?

16:01.276 --> 16:05.906
I'm not white and I don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

16:10.119 --> 16:12.849
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
I'll call you tomorrow.

17:06.474 --> 17:08.965
Am I the first white woman
you've been with?

17:11.079 --> 17:12.411
No, you ain't.

17:12.748 --> 17:14.909
Shit, I done had plenty.

17:16.852 --> 17:18.410
That isn't a whore?

17:36.505 --> 17:37.529
Take your time.

17:37.740 --> 17:41.267
Sophia's not going anywhere.

17:42.411 --> 17:43.844
I told you to walk...

17:44.346 --> 17:45.779
...don't run.

17:48.851 --> 17:51.012
I don't like women that talk too much.

17:55.524 --> 17:57.082
Who wants to talk?

18:16.145 --> 18:17.840
You missed me.

18:18.046 --> 18:19.980
Try this on for size.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.713
-I ducked.
-You ducked?

18:25.921 --> 18:28.185
You didn't! I got you
right between the toes!

18:28.390 --> 18:31.848
I'm tired of playing the cops.
I wanna be Bogart.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.927
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

18:35.130 --> 18:36.791
I'm not too short to be Cagney.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.236
One more!

18:46.708 --> 18:50.235
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

18:56.618 --> 18:58.085
You used to be a big shot.

19:03.091 --> 19:05.218
There is just nothing I can do.

19:05.427 --> 19:08.658
-What do you mean, took his own life?
-You heard the verdict.

19:08.864 --> 19:13.665
Verdict? A man takes a hammer and
bashes in the back of his own head?

19:13.869 --> 19:16.235
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

19:16.772 --> 19:19.070
We only act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

19:19.274 --> 19:21.174
Do you pay or don't you?

19:26.281 --> 19:27.680
Read the policy, ma'am.

19:28.517 --> 19:31.042
It clearly states....

19:39.461 --> 19:40.485
Come here, Sophia.

19:50.539 --> 19:52.131
You're the man.

19:54.176 --> 19:55.575
Sit down.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.377
What's your story?

20:03.585 --> 20:06.816
You one of them white chicks
can't get enough colored studs?

20:17.566 --> 20:19.227
IKiss my foot.

20:21.770 --> 20:23.601
Go ahead, kiss it.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.475
Now feed me.

20:55.304 --> 20:57.135
That's your story, girl.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.530
So when you gonna holler rape?

20:59.908 --> 21:00.738
Me?

21:00.943 --> 21:03.503
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

21:03.712 --> 21:04.974
Sure you would.

21:05.714 --> 21:07.511
Malcolm, let me feed you.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.540
Come on.

21:10.385 --> 21:12.114
While they're hot.

21:20.462 --> 21:23.090
I wish your mother and father
could see you now.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.858
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

21:26.068 --> 21:28.127
I sure wish Laura could see us.

22:18.887 --> 22:20.684
Please, Malcolm.

22:21.490 --> 22:23.651
There's nobody around.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.856
No, this ain't right.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.527
-Why?
-Because you--

22:30.732 --> 22:33.724
No, it's because of
the white girl, isn't it?

22:33.935 --> 22:38.395
-It's not because of that.
-Folks say you run around with her.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.407
Save it for Mr. Right. Your
grandmother's smarter than you think.

22:46.014 --> 22:48.539
I'm sorry she raised me that way.

22:54.823 --> 22:56.290
Is your mother alive?

22:56.525 --> 22:57.514
Yes, she's alive.

22:59.061 --> 23:02.030
When I was a kid, I was so poor
I thought "not for sale" ...

23:02.230 --> 23:04.391
...was a brand name.

23:05.067 --> 23:05.965
I did knock.

23:06.168 --> 23:07.635
Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

23:08.837 --> 23:12.000
There's no point in fighting about it.
I'm sorry.

23:12.274 --> 23:15.243
-May I sit down?
-You're nice enough to ask.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.205
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.014
-Since your husband's death...
-Murder. Murder.

23:25.387 --> 23:29.824
...there's a question as to whether you
can raise these children alone.

23:31.259 --> 23:33.284
These are my children.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.657
They're mine.

23:37.732 --> 23:39.324
And they ain't no question.

23:39.534 --> 23:44.471
Sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor
is the only kindness.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.837
All your children are delinquent...

23:47.042 --> 23:50.170
...and one at least,
Malcolm, is a thief.

23:50.378 --> 23:51.037
Get out!

23:51.246 --> 23:54.738
Your control over your
children is nonexistent.

23:54.950 --> 23:56.417
Did you hear me?

23:59.154 --> 24:00.416
You will regret this.

24:00.622 --> 24:04.888
If you don't move through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

24:07.662 --> 24:11.120
<i>We were parceled out, all of us.</i>

24:11.766 --> 24:15.702
<i>I truly believe that if ever</i>
<i>a state agency destroyed a family...</i>

24:16.037 --> 24:17.402
<i>...it destroyed ours.</i>

24:17.973 --> 24:22.910
<i>I was sent to a detention</i>
<i>home and lived at this woman's house.</i>

24:23.178 --> 24:24.611
<i>Mrs. Swerlin.</i>

24:24.813 --> 24:27.941
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

24:28.350 --> 24:30.045
We'll treat him like a brother.

24:31.186 --> 24:34.553
<i>I was special. The only</i>
<i>colored kid in the class.</i>

24:34.856 --> 24:38.155
<i>I became sort of a mascot,</i>
<i>like a pink poodle.</i>

24:38.827 --> 24:42.422
<i>I got called a nigger so much,</i>
<i>I didn't think it was wrong.</i>

24:42.631 --> 24:44.565
<i>I thought it was my name.</i>

24:45.467 --> 24:48.664
<i>They talked about me like I wasn't</i>
<i>there. Like a pedigreed dog...</i>

24:48.870 --> 24:50.303
<i>...or a horse.</i>

24:51.072 --> 24:52.334
<i>Like I was invisible.</i>

24:52.741 --> 24:56.438
The important thing
is to be realistic.

24:56.645 --> 24:59.136
We all like you here, you know that.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.238
But you're a nigger...

25:01.483 --> 25:04.748
...and a lawyer is no realistic
goal for a nigger.

25:04.953 --> 25:07.547
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

25:07.822 --> 25:10.188
I gets the best grades in class.

25:10.392 --> 25:13.828
I got voted class president.
I want to be a lawyer.

25:14.029 --> 25:17.157
I want you to think about
something that you can be.

25:17.699 --> 25:20.930
You're good with your hands,
making things.

25:21.503 --> 25:23.494
People would give you work. I would.

25:24.839 --> 25:26.670
Why not become a carpenter?

25:27.409 --> 25:29.934
That's a good profession for a colored.

25:31.079 --> 25:32.774
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.678
Jesus was a carpenter.

25:36.685 --> 25:39.916
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.348
Remember what we said.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.352
"Nothing succeeds like success."
Say it.

25:46.561 --> 25:48.961
Nothing succeeds like success.

25:49.164 --> 25:51.064
As long as you're realistic.

25:51.266 --> 25:52.995
It's not the end of the world.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.629
I said, "Don't...

25:58.473 --> 26:00.873
...let them give that boy no pig."

26:01.443 --> 26:03.240
<i>It wasn't the end</i>
<i>of the world for me.</i>

26:03.445 --> 26:05.777
<i>But it was the beginning of the end</i>
<i>for my mother.</i>

26:10.952 --> 26:13.386
<i>A right cross to the jaw by Louis.</i>

26:16.191 --> 26:19.957
<i>Louis takes Conn's head back</i>
<i>with a right uppercut.</i>

26:20.161 --> 26:21.788
<i>Louis hits left and right.</i>

26:21.997 --> 26:25.489
<i>And Conn is down</i>
<i>with a right cross to the jaw!</i>

26:25.734 --> 26:27.292
<i>He's taking the count.</i>

26:27.502 --> 26:30.164
<i>Four, five, six...</i>

26:30.905 --> 26:34.068
<i>...seven. He's on his back.</i>
<i>Eight. Nine.</i>

26:34.342 --> 26:38.210
<i>He's getting up!</i>
<i>The referee says it's all over!</i>

26:41.816 --> 26:44.148
What in hell is going on?

26:44.519 --> 26:45.349
Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

26:45.553 --> 26:47.020
The customer's are hungry.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.989
Soup done finished, Mr. Cooper.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.919
Right, Mr. Charlie.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.891
The name is Mr. Cooper.

26:53.628 --> 26:54.754
Don't you forget it.

26:55.497 --> 26:57.226
Mr. Cooper.

27:00.502 --> 27:02.936
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

27:03.138 --> 27:04.400
I got a wife and six kids!

27:04.606 --> 27:07.006
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

27:07.208 --> 27:09.642
You is a young fool!

27:18.186 --> 27:20.882
<i>There'll never be another one like that!</i>

27:22.290 --> 27:23.450
He's done it!

27:23.658 --> 27:25.990
<i>And by a knockout...</i>

27:26.194 --> 27:29.721
<i>...and still the world's</i>
<i>heavyweight champion:</i>

27:29.964 --> 27:32.125
<i>Joe Louis!</i>

27:32.334 --> 27:34.097
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

27:34.302 --> 27:37.066
Ham and cheese here! I got coffee.

27:37.272 --> 27:39.900
-Lemon meringue pie.
-Hey, boy!

27:40.175 --> 27:43.508
-Ham and cheese.
-Yes, sir. Best in the house.

27:43.712 --> 27:46.476
-You're pleased with yourself.
-I aims to please, sir.

27:46.681 --> 27:47.807
I'm pleased to aim.

27:48.016 --> 27:49.574
-I like you, boy.
-Thank you.

27:53.621 --> 27:54.451
IKeep the change.

27:54.656 --> 27:56.988
Right, sir!
Ham and cheese!

28:05.166 --> 28:05.996
Harlem!

28:27.856 --> 28:30.620
<i>And here's Joe Lewis,</i>
<i>back in Harlem.</i>

28:31.192 --> 28:33.319
<i>They're celebrating!</i>
<i>They're going crazy!</i>

28:33.528 --> 28:36.725
<i>They're dancing! They're hanging</i>
<i>from street signs!</i>

28:36.931 --> 28:38.660
<i>Everybody's out!</i>

28:39.033 --> 28:42.059
<i>Everyone's having a great time!</i>
<i>Listen to them roar!</i>

29:17.605 --> 29:20.472
<i>Joe's a credit to his race.</i>
<i>What a fine gentleman!</i>

29:20.742 --> 29:22.710
<i>But he's also a fine American.</i>

29:22.911 --> 29:26.244
<i>The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!</i>

29:28.783 --> 29:29.977
Hey, sugar.

29:30.251 --> 29:32.913
-Slow down. What's your hurry?
-No hurry.

29:33.121 --> 29:34.713
Let me show you something new.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.916
I got gold watches, diamond rings.

29:38.126 --> 29:40.060
Any one of these. Whatever you need.

29:40.395 --> 29:41.327
I don't need that.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.589
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

29:44.799 --> 29:46.630
A couple of these
make a player look good.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.230
My man!

30:19.434 --> 30:23.666
-The word is "excuse me," boy.
-"Excuse me" don't shine my shoes.

30:23.872 --> 30:25.567
Then stay out of my way.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.907
Old country nigger.

30:34.349 --> 30:36.112
What you gonna do?

30:42.757 --> 30:43.917
Go home to your mama?

30:54.102 --> 30:58.801
Nigger, don't you ever in your life
say anything against my mother!

31:20.595 --> 31:21.823
Give me a whiskey.

31:31.105 --> 31:32.766
I ordered a single, Jack.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.499
The double's on that gentleman, "Jack."

31:40.181 --> 31:41.341
Who is that?

31:42.250 --> 31:44.343
That's West Indian Archie.

31:44.786 --> 31:46.447
What's his angle?

31:47.689 --> 31:50.283
Some of this, some of that.

32:03.271 --> 32:05.000
Nothing's gonna bite you.

32:06.741 --> 32:08.800
You look like you're new in town.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.138
From what I can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.177
He had it coming.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.011
Pull up a chair.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.161
What do they call you?

32:28.529 --> 32:29.655
Red.

32:30.498 --> 32:31.726
And I ain't no punk.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.331
You better not be.

32:34.068 --> 32:36.764
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

32:36.971 --> 32:38.131
Man live by his rep.

32:38.406 --> 32:39.270
Better believe it.

32:40.775 --> 32:42.265
So what do you do?

32:42.477 --> 32:43.466
Working on the train.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.043
Like that job?

32:46.514 --> 32:50.143
-IKeeps me out of the Army.
-They want you, nothing'll keep you out.

32:50.351 --> 32:51.181
Not this boy.

32:53.121 --> 32:55.589
So I hear tell
you're a good man to know.

32:55.790 --> 32:57.815
-Where you hear that?
-Boston, where I'm from.

32:58.026 --> 32:59.550
IKiss my neck.

32:59.927 --> 33:01.451
I've never been in Beantown.

33:01.663 --> 33:04.496
Like the man said, a man's rep travels.

33:05.533 --> 33:06.864
How about that!

33:09.103 --> 33:10.229
You bullshitting me?

33:10.438 --> 33:13.464
My father told me
never bullshit a West Indian.

33:13.675 --> 33:14.903
Your daddy's West Indian?

33:15.109 --> 33:16.269
My mama.

33:16.944 --> 33:18.707
She's from Grenada.

33:19.013 --> 33:20.275
Grenada.

33:24.218 --> 33:25.082
I like this guy.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.420
I like your country.

33:28.222 --> 33:29.519
Grenada.

33:29.724 --> 33:32.284
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

33:32.627 --> 33:34.185
And them shoes?

33:34.495 --> 33:35.325
Oh, my.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.963
We can do something about that.

33:37.165 --> 33:40.430
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man!

33:40.635 --> 33:41.795
Relax.

33:42.470 --> 33:43.494
How do I find you?

33:43.705 --> 33:44.899
You can't.

33:45.707 --> 33:47.072
I get ahold of you.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.436
All right, I'll write it down.

33:49.644 --> 33:51.475
Don't ever write anything down.

33:51.679 --> 33:53.408
File it up here.

33:53.748 --> 33:55.147
Like I do.

33:55.983 --> 33:59.384
If the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

33:59.921 --> 34:00.979
Dig?

34:02.523 --> 34:05.117
Yeah, I dig. Right.

34:10.098 --> 34:11.224
Look me in the face.

34:11.431 --> 34:13.092
Did you just con me?

34:16.003 --> 34:17.094
Yes, sir.

34:17.505 --> 34:18.402
Why?

34:18.606 --> 34:20.130
Because I want in.

34:21.007 --> 34:23.670
It don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

34:23.878 --> 34:25.539
At least he ain't lying.

34:25.746 --> 34:27.179
I have a run to make.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.713
Let me make that run
with you, Mr. Archie.

34:38.926 --> 34:39.915
I like your heart.

34:41.027 --> 34:42.688
I like your style.

34:43.630 --> 34:45.656
You might just do, Mr. Red.

34:45.867 --> 34:49.063
Unless you have to
get back to your train job.

34:49.270 --> 34:51.397
I've told him what to do
with that train.

34:51.606 --> 34:52.833
-When?
-Just now.

34:58.246 --> 34:59.474
All right.

35:00.214 --> 35:01.374
Come with me.

35:01.716 --> 35:03.479
I'm taking you shopping.

35:05.219 --> 35:06.880
Cadillac's the name.

35:07.655 --> 35:09.316
Sammy, man.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.189
-You ready?
-Good.

35:15.596 --> 35:17.496
Button more buttons on the jacket.

35:25.673 --> 35:27.800
You look good.

35:28.075 --> 35:29.337
But you're missing something.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.374
Frisk me.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.979
Go ahead, frisk me.

35:41.622 --> 35:42.782
Nothing, right?

35:48.996 --> 35:50.224
I'm still carrying.

35:50.598 --> 35:52.259
This was my first gun.

35:53.935 --> 35:55.061
Now it's yours.

36:02.610 --> 36:03.474
Thank you.

36:03.678 --> 36:04.940
You wear it...

36:05.780 --> 36:07.213
...wear it so.

36:08.549 --> 36:10.107
Small of the back.

36:11.819 --> 36:13.616
Now you're outfitted.

36:15.523 --> 36:16.751
Ready for the streets?

36:16.958 --> 36:18.289
I'm ready.

36:19.126 --> 36:19.990
Let them come.

36:20.194 --> 36:24.995
Let us now turn to
the Gospel According to St. John.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.528
Chapter 3...

36:26.734 --> 36:29.294
...verse 23.

36:29.804 --> 36:30.634
323.

36:30.838 --> 36:35.741
"And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

36:37.178 --> 36:40.477
...because there was much water.

36:41.916 --> 36:44.783
And they came...

36:45.419 --> 36:47.649
...and were baptized."

36:49.957 --> 36:51.481
313.

36:53.361 --> 36:54.328
255.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.558
It got to be 251.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.028
403.

36:58.232 --> 37:00.166
I saw it in my dream.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.802
555.

37:03.004 --> 37:05.495
-What do you know?
-I feel straight.

37:06.607 --> 37:07.904
Your lucky day.

37:08.109 --> 37:09.474
Roll it for me.

37:10.945 --> 37:13.175
I told you, no paper, no trouble.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.115
I'm working on it.

37:16.183 --> 37:18.583
I keep my numbers in my head.

37:18.786 --> 37:22.688
I've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

37:37.605 --> 37:38.799
Your turn.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.237
Easy.

37:49.884 --> 37:51.112
Easy.

37:53.120 --> 37:53.950
You there?

37:54.155 --> 37:55.417
If I ain't, I'm next door.

37:55.656 --> 37:59.592
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

38:00.127 --> 38:01.492
The girl.

38:18.479 --> 38:20.572
About as mellow as I can be.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.112
Cool enough to kill.

38:27.321 --> 38:28.720
I realize that.

38:31.325 --> 38:33.657
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.
-Stick them up.

38:37.498 --> 38:38.465
Archie!

38:41.168 --> 38:42.157
Baby?

38:48.075 --> 38:50.066
Malcolm, you're so funny.

38:52.513 --> 38:54.037
Give me some money, baby.

38:59.553 --> 39:01.248
Come on, baby.

39:01.489 --> 39:03.286
The bitch move too slow.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.526
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

39:10.731 --> 39:12.198
What time is it, baby?

39:13.334 --> 39:15.325
8:21.

39:15.569 --> 39:16.968
I like that. Combinate me.

39:17.638 --> 39:19.299
821.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.202
128.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.001
218.

39:24.245 --> 39:25.337
I'm taking the bet.

39:29.984 --> 39:31.747
Time to reload.

40:19.366 --> 40:22.426
I thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

40:22.636 --> 40:23.534
You said that.

40:23.804 --> 40:25.738
I'm sorry. I say a lot of things.

40:25.973 --> 40:26.871
I believed you.

40:27.074 --> 40:30.635
Do your job now. Get me a pack
of Lucky Strikes and a cognac.

40:43.791 --> 40:44.951
Daniel come in yet?

40:45.159 --> 40:46.649
Ain't that him?

40:47.428 --> 40:48.417
Gorgeous!

40:49.096 --> 40:52.088
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

40:53.801 --> 40:55.598
Let me look at you.

40:57.304 --> 41:00.762
-I've been missing you today, Laura.
-How you doing, baby?

41:00.975 --> 41:04.638
I'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

41:04.845 --> 41:07.405
No, baby, I didn't go to work.

41:07.615 --> 41:10.584
-I need a five-spot.
-I gave you 10 this morning.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.485
Give me the goddamn $5!

41:13.687 --> 41:15.211
It ain't the money.
I wanna...

41:15.422 --> 41:17.014
...make sure you're okay.

41:17.224 --> 41:19.454
I gotta pay back this guy.

41:20.127 --> 41:21.321
I'll be right back.

41:22.663 --> 41:24.096
Like last time?

41:24.298 --> 41:26.266
I swear, I'll be right back.

41:26.467 --> 41:28.526
Laura, I love you.

41:37.011 --> 41:38.535
You know that chick?

41:40.614 --> 41:42.479
You a private detective now?

41:42.683 --> 41:43.650
Just asking.

41:43.851 --> 41:45.944
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

41:46.153 --> 41:48.815
I ask you the questions.
You understand?

41:49.690 --> 41:52.090
-She come in here a lot?
-Almost every night.

41:52.293 --> 41:53.317
With him?

41:54.995 --> 41:57.463
-She know he's high?
-Lf she got eyes, she do.

41:59.733 --> 42:00.757
She ain't hooking?

42:01.135 --> 42:02.966
Not yet, Red.

42:03.504 --> 42:06.632
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

42:11.679 --> 42:13.146
You stuck on her?

42:13.347 --> 42:17.010
That's your problem.
You need to mind your own business.

42:20.154 --> 42:21.212
Don't do that!

42:21.422 --> 42:24.220
I wanna talk to you, all right?
Have a seat.

42:33.367 --> 42:35.597
-Don't pay him any mind, hear?
-All right.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.430
-All right?
-I'm all right.

42:44.111 --> 42:46.204
Buy yourself something nice.

42:58.025 --> 42:59.219
Hey, baby.

43:04.531 --> 43:05.964
Give me a light.

43:16.543 --> 43:18.773
You look uptight.
What's the problem?

43:18.979 --> 43:19.968
-No problem.
-Sure?

43:20.180 --> 43:23.149
Everything's all right.
I'm not worrying about it.

43:25.753 --> 43:27.584
I'm thinking about my money.

43:28.088 --> 43:29.885
Six big ones you owe me, right?

43:30.090 --> 43:30.920
What?

43:31.125 --> 43:32.251
821.
It hit, didn't it?

43:32.459 --> 43:34.017
You didn't have 821.

43:34.495 --> 43:37.931
Were you high? I threw the slats
at you, told you to combinate me.

43:38.332 --> 43:39.594
You never had it.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.132
I tell you I did. Sophia was there.

43:42.503 --> 43:44.061
You remember, don't you?

43:44.271 --> 43:45.260
What would she say?

43:46.774 --> 43:48.366
Don't do this.

43:48.575 --> 43:49.599
All right?

43:50.010 --> 43:51.341
All right.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.009
All right, skip it.

43:55.282 --> 43:56.874
But you're slipping, aren't you?

43:57.618 --> 43:59.609
You done slipped.

44:02.790 --> 44:04.348
Archie, wait.

44:15.636 --> 44:17.763
Come on, Archie. Look....

44:18.539 --> 44:21.440
Come on. You want a drink
or something? I'm buying.

44:21.642 --> 44:22.904
I ain't drinking with you.

44:25.479 --> 44:26.605
All right?

44:30.818 --> 44:31.978
Come, Sam.

44:33.554 --> 44:35.385
I'll be right there, man.

44:41.962 --> 44:44.123
Twenty-two years.

44:44.331 --> 44:47.960
Twenty-two years, I never
knowed him to forget a number.

44:48.168 --> 44:49.635
First time for everything.

44:49.837 --> 44:51.702
What are you talking about?

44:51.905 --> 44:56.501
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

44:56.744 --> 44:59.770
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

45:00.748 --> 45:04.878
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

45:05.519 --> 45:08.852
Dead, dead, dead.

45:10.824 --> 45:12.314
You go and tell him that.

45:19.533 --> 45:21.262
My man, Red.

45:22.169 --> 45:23.261
Night to you.

45:24.605 --> 45:27.938
I don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

46:01.642 --> 46:04.236
Didn't I tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

46:10.350 --> 46:11.476
You know what?

46:13.587 --> 46:15.316
You're a damn liar.

46:15.589 --> 46:16.886
And so is she.

46:20.494 --> 46:22.121
So you figure to take me...

46:22.329 --> 46:23.921
...you bastard?

46:24.765 --> 46:26.027
I'm taking you.

46:26.233 --> 46:28.565
-So it's you and me?
-That's right.

46:28.769 --> 46:30.361
I'll give you the $ 600.

46:30.571 --> 46:32.300
-I don't want it.
-I'm wearing.

46:32.506 --> 46:35.634
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.483
Let's walk.

46:56.363 --> 46:58.695
So this is how I'm going out?

46:59.466 --> 47:02.026
-In a toe-down?
-Toe-down, yes.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.039
-Let's go.
-We'll let Billie finish.

47:51.919 --> 47:53.284
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:53.487 --> 47:56.251
<i>Thank you very much. Thank you.</i>

48:18.912 --> 48:19.936
Wake up.

48:21.181 --> 48:22.478
Wake up!

48:24.551 --> 48:26.109
There's somebody out there.

48:29.289 --> 48:30.779
Wake the kids.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.398
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

48:50.277 --> 48:51.107
Go! Go!

48:54.481 --> 48:55.470
Careful!

48:59.119 --> 49:02.680
-Good thing we're all good Christians.
-It's time for you to leave this town.

49:02.889 --> 49:04.015
It's a free country.

49:04.224 --> 49:07.716
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

49:07.928 --> 49:08.952
I ain't a boy!

49:09.162 --> 49:10.789
-I'm a man!
-You're a dead nigger.

49:10.998 --> 49:13.728
And a real man don't hide
behind sheets!

49:13.934 --> 49:16.425
You take these bullets for them sheets!

49:22.976 --> 49:25.444
I know you're a better shot than that.

49:25.746 --> 49:27.338
You should've killed them.

49:27.848 --> 49:29.816
You should've shot them all dead.

49:30.017 --> 49:31.712
I just wanted to scare them.

49:32.619 --> 49:35.213
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

49:36.757 --> 49:38.952
They won't be here no time soon.

49:39.559 --> 49:40.890
I'm a man!

49:43.030 --> 49:44.224
That'll teach you.

49:51.672 --> 49:52.502
<i>Get a doctor!</i>

49:52.706 --> 49:55.174
<i>He doesn't need a doctor,</i>
<i>he needs a preacher.</i>

49:56.376 --> 49:58.401
I'm glad we got you out of there.

49:58.812 --> 50:01.645
With Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

50:01.848 --> 50:04.544
...Boston's the best
goddamn place for you.

50:05.519 --> 50:07.749
We'll take it easy, huh, baby?

50:08.055 --> 50:11.616
I got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

50:11.892 --> 50:14.622
Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.

50:15.095 --> 50:18.189
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll stake you.

50:18.465 --> 50:20.956
I got my band. I'm blowing great sax.

50:21.501 --> 50:23.162
You ain't even heard us play!

50:23.370 --> 50:25.429
<i>Like every hustler, I was trapped.</i>

50:25.639 --> 50:27.766
<i>Cats that hung together</i>
<i>to find security...</i>

50:27.974 --> 50:30.101
<i>...to find an answer, found nothing.</i>

50:30.310 --> 50:32.437
<i>Cats that might've cured cancer....</i>

50:32.646 --> 50:35.513
<i>West Indian Archie might've been</i>
<i>a mathematical genius.</i>

50:35.716 --> 50:38.708
<i>We were all victims</i>
<i>of the American social order.</i>

50:39.052 --> 50:42.681
<i>Until that time, there were</i>
<i>three things I was always afraid of:</i>

50:42.889 --> 50:45.824
<i>A job, a bust and jail.</i>

50:46.026 --> 50:50.360
<i>But I realized then that I wasn't</i>
<i>afraid of anything. I was an animal.</i>

50:51.198 --> 50:52.859
He don't look too good.

50:55.235 --> 50:57.226
We're gonna rob this town blind.

50:57.437 --> 50:59.166
Anybody want out, say so now.

51:01.174 --> 51:04.041
I set up a stake, and I got
somebody to move the goods.

51:04.244 --> 51:06.474
We need a driver. Any suggestions?

51:06.680 --> 51:08.307
How about Rudy?

51:09.116 --> 51:10.276
Who's Rudy?

51:12.252 --> 51:15.517
I'm half-wop, half-nigger.
I'm not afraid of nobody.

51:17.457 --> 51:18.321
What do you do?

51:18.525 --> 51:19.924
Name it, I claim it.

51:20.127 --> 51:22.687
Rudy does catering. Rich joints.

51:22.896 --> 51:23.726
All right.

51:23.930 --> 51:25.090
Tell him about Baldy.

51:28.135 --> 51:30.296
He's this old, rich ofay motherfucker.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.529
I give him a bath every Friday night.

51:32.739 --> 51:36.573
Towel him off,
talcum powder on him, put him to bed.

51:36.977 --> 51:38.911
Just like a baby.
He gets his jollies off.

51:39.112 --> 51:40.204
What about him?

51:40.413 --> 51:44.372
Guy's got jewelry. He's got
a coin collection. He's got china.

51:44.584 --> 51:46.848
-He's got rugs.
-That might be all right.

51:47.053 --> 51:50.750
Shit, I know this town.
I got my own fences.

51:52.159 --> 51:53.126
Who is this guy?

51:54.928 --> 51:56.225
Who put you in charge?

51:56.963 --> 51:58.089
You wanna be in charge?

51:58.298 --> 51:59.128
I am in charge.

51:59.332 --> 52:02.529
-You head nigger in charge.
-I'm the head nigger in charge.

52:02.736 --> 52:04.033
Big-head nigger.

52:06.106 --> 52:07.232
I'll tell you what.

52:08.575 --> 52:10.167
Because I'm a fair man...

52:11.178 --> 52:13.339
...and I like
big-head niggers like you.

52:14.147 --> 52:15.512
We'll flip for it.

52:16.950 --> 52:17.939
We'll flip this.

52:24.958 --> 52:26.448
She loves me.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.123
She loves me not.

52:29.963 --> 52:31.692
She loves me.

52:33.366 --> 52:35.197
She loves me not.

52:37.637 --> 52:38.626
She loves me.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.312
I'll flip first.

52:57.290 --> 52:58.552
Red, cool it. Come on.

52:58.758 --> 53:00.555
Head man in charge, right?

53:01.127 --> 53:02.719
Put the gun down.

53:03.997 --> 53:05.430
We believe you.

53:06.166 --> 53:07.633
We believe you.

53:08.835 --> 53:11.668
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For chrissakes!

53:11.872 --> 53:13.169
Your turn, Rudy.

53:13.373 --> 53:15.739
Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

53:21.882 --> 53:23.179
You don't wanna flip?

53:23.750 --> 53:26.048
-Let me show you how.
-Red, don't!

53:26.253 --> 53:28.187
He doesn't know how.
I have to show him.

53:28.922 --> 53:30.480
Did you miss something?

53:30.690 --> 53:33.523
You got your eyes open?
Look at me.

53:33.994 --> 53:36.019
You don't have to do this, Red.

53:37.530 --> 53:39.259
That was really dumb.

53:42.903 --> 53:46.737
Your flip. You wanna do it?
No, you don't, do you?

53:46.940 --> 53:48.271
I'll help you.

53:48.608 --> 53:50.337
-Here.
-Red, don't.

53:52.679 --> 53:55.011
Should we shoot that
wop nose of yours off?

53:55.215 --> 53:58.707
Or is that the nigger side?
Is that the wop side or the nigger side?

53:59.152 --> 54:02.349
Is that wop or nigger?
I guess that's the wop side.

54:02.589 --> 54:03.920
I'm not going to jail.

54:04.124 --> 54:07.150
Put the gun away.
Come on, this is enough.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.453
Say goodbye, Rudy.

54:13.767 --> 54:14.893
Rudy said something.

54:15.101 --> 54:16.466
What'd you say?

54:17.904 --> 54:19.394
Speak up.

54:22.275 --> 54:25.642
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna stop?

54:26.713 --> 54:28.613
I did two, so I owe you two.

54:28.882 --> 54:30.076
You got it.

54:30.283 --> 54:32.945
-I got it. What did you say?
-You got it.

54:33.153 --> 54:34.814
Rudy says I got it.

54:36.256 --> 54:38.121
Rudy, don't you ever...

54:38.325 --> 54:41.658
...try and cross someone who
ain't afraid to die, you hear me?

54:43.129 --> 54:44.426
All right.

54:45.265 --> 54:46.527
This is what we'll do.

54:46.733 --> 54:49.133
We'll hit old Talcum Powder tonight.

54:49.336 --> 54:52.396
My friend Rudy's gonna
draw up the plans.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.936
Everything that's in the house, right?

54:55.675 --> 54:59.111
Peg, Sophia, you get those tools
like I asked you.

54:59.312 --> 55:03.612
We're gonna hit tonight because some of
us have high visibility during the day.

55:07.354 --> 55:09.288
It's okay with you, right?

55:13.059 --> 55:14.822
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

55:15.028 --> 55:16.859
One big happy family.

55:20.367 --> 55:21.629
I love you.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.522
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

55:47.727 --> 55:48.887
What bullet?

55:49.262 --> 55:50.559
The bullet.

55:53.166 --> 55:54.497
You're crazy.

56:05.945 --> 56:06.934
Shorty!

56:24.164 --> 56:26.632
Easy, Shorty, easy.

57:34.434 --> 57:36.129
My man, Red.

57:37.570 --> 57:38.901
My man!

57:40.673 --> 57:42.607
When's Rudy due back?

57:43.643 --> 57:45.167
Thirty minutes.

57:48.314 --> 57:50.179
I'm almost finished.

57:56.523 --> 57:59.617
Girls ought to be getting back
from casing that rug joint.

57:59.859 --> 58:01.121
They should be.

58:02.896 --> 58:04.693
We've done a good job.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.525
We're killing them, ain't we?

58:09.636 --> 58:12.264
They don't know what's hitting them.

58:12.472 --> 58:15.635
-Let me work back in this kitchen.
-You getting the kitchen?

58:15.842 --> 58:18.208
Putting naps on in the kitchen.

58:18.411 --> 58:22.211
If you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

58:23.316 --> 58:25.147
All right, let's go to the sink.

58:29.289 --> 58:31.154
Come on, it's starting to heat up.

58:31.357 --> 58:33.382
-It's burning?
-It's all right.

58:35.061 --> 58:36.653
Put your head down.

58:38.665 --> 58:41.156
-Come on, man.
-I turned it.

58:49.242 --> 58:51.506
It's started to sting.
Get out of the way!

58:56.916 --> 58:57.746
It's burning?

58:57.951 --> 58:59.578
Hell, yeah, it's burning!

59:03.389 --> 59:04.879
Goddamn it!

59:11.231 --> 59:13.961
Nigger, take your head
out of the shit bowl!

59:14.167 --> 59:15.862
That's it. Get up slowly.

59:16.336 --> 59:19.237
Watch it! No funny business now.

59:19.439 --> 59:21.907
Red, the jig is up.

59:22.108 --> 59:24.804
<i>The average first offender</i>
<i>gets two years for burglary.</i>

59:25.245 --> 59:28.180
<i>We were all first offenders.</i>
<i>That's what the girls drew.</i>

59:28.381 --> 59:30.849
Two years in the women's reformatory.

59:31.050 --> 59:32.415
<i>Our crime wasn't burglary.</i>

59:32.719 --> 59:36.246
<i>It was sleeping with white girls.</i>
<i>They threw the book at us.</i>

59:36.456 --> 59:39.482
Burglary, count one, 8 to 10 years.

59:39.692 --> 59:41.956
Count two, 8 to 10 years.

59:42.161 --> 59:44.652
Count three, 8 to 10 years.

59:44.864 --> 59:47.162
Count four, 8 to 10 years.

59:47.367 --> 59:49.494
Count five, 8 to 10 years.

59:49.702 --> 59:54.469
Count six, 8 to 10 years.
Count seven, 8 to 10 years.

59:54.741 --> 59:56.936
Count eight, 8 to 10 years.

59:57.143 --> 01:00:01.603
Count nine, 8 to 10 years.
Count ten, 8 to 10 years.

01:00:01.814 --> 01:00:06.376
Count eleven, 8 to 10 years.
Count twelve, 8 to 10 years.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.053
Count thirteen, 8 to 10 years,
and count fourteen--

01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:12.884
<i>Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.</i>

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:15.117
Sentences to run concurrently.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:20.098
<i>Shorty thought he'd given us 100 years,</i>
<i>until I explained "concurrently. "</i>

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.791
<i>It meant a minimum of</i>
<i>10 years hard labor...</i>

01:00:23.002 --> 01:00:25.334
<i>...at the Charlestown State Prison.</i>

01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:27.733
<i>The date was February 1946.</i>

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.202
<i>Fuck you.</i>

01:00:35.014 --> 01:00:37.244
Cellblock A, secure.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.682
Look at him.

01:01:15.888 --> 01:01:17.048
I see him.

01:01:17.323 --> 01:01:19.120
He about to bust?

01:01:19.325 --> 01:01:22.817
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give them the pleasure.

01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:24.827
Little!

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:28.963
Your number.

01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:30.299
Little!

01:01:31.003 --> 01:01:31.662
What?

01:01:31.871 --> 01:01:32.929
Give him a break.

01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:36.342
-He's a new fish.
-I'll give him a break.

01:01:37.677 --> 01:01:39.440
Now state your number, Little.

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:40.872
I forgot it.

01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:42.208
State it.

01:01:42.415 --> 01:01:43.074
I forgot it.

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.943
You can read it!

01:01:45.184 --> 01:01:46.947
-Can't you read, boy?
-Fuck you!

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:49.414
I'll teach you a lesson.

01:01:52.558 --> 01:01:53.752
I forgot it!

01:01:54.227 --> 01:01:55.285
I forgot it!

01:01:55.528 --> 01:01:56.756
I forgot it!

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:05.130
They ain't gonna break me down.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:12.703
I'm in this situation,
and I'm getting out.

01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:15.347
Anything go wrong, I'm strong.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:18.339
Time's up, Little.

01:02:19.085 --> 01:02:20.814
Now state your number.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:26.318
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:31.721
Water!

01:02:33.399 --> 01:02:34.491
Water!

01:02:51.717 --> 01:02:53.082
You want a smoke?

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:04.492
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son?

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:05.925
A friend?

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.399
He's a friend?
If he's such a friend, where is he?

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:12.832
What's he done for me?

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.370
A friend!

01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:18.039
Tell you what you do,
you tell him to call me.

01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:20.770
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.574
Solitary 2-2607.

01:03:23.783 --> 01:03:25.910
What he done for me, chappy?

01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:28.086
Where is he when I need him?

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:32.121
You tell me that! Where is this Jesus?
I'll tell you where.

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:35.758
He's out with the police captain!
I'll straighten him out!

01:03:35.962 --> 01:03:39.056
What's he done for me?
He ain't done nothing for me!

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:47.433
"What a friend we have in Jesus."
Jesus can kiss my ass!

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.235
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass.
How about that? Tell him that.

01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:46.055
Little!

01:04:48.701 --> 01:04:50.362
State your number.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.860
Come on, state it!

01:04:53.873 --> 01:04:55.431
A-22....

01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:56.608
What?

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:58.640
A-228....

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:01.037
Come on.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:19.153
I know how you feel.

01:05:19.732 --> 01:05:21.461
Like you want to lay down and die.

01:05:23.703 --> 01:05:25.261
I brought you something.

01:05:25.938 --> 01:05:28.304
I don't need no more favors from you.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:29.531
It's nutmeg.

01:05:29.742 --> 01:05:34.145
Put it in the water. You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.838
It's not cocaine,
but it'll help some.

01:05:43.723 --> 01:05:46.419
Drink it slow.
The stuff is strong.

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:55.064
So what's your hype?

01:05:55.768 --> 01:05:59.067
I can show you how to get out
of prison. And it's no hype.

01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:01.432
Talk, daddy-o. I'm listening.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:06.573
-This ain't bad. You got some more?
-That's the last fix I'm giving you.

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:09.240
So why'd you give it to me?

01:06:09.448 --> 01:06:13.612
Because you needed it.
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

01:06:14.954 --> 01:06:17.286
Nigger, get on out of my face.

01:06:17.523 --> 01:06:20.856
I think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.085
Why the hell don't you use it?

01:06:24.463 --> 01:06:28.365
You can't bust out of here
like they do in the movies.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:31.066
Even if you get out,
you're still in prison.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.567
You ain't lying.

01:06:32.772 --> 01:06:36.731
You'll bang against a stone wall.
You're not using your brain!

01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:38.876
That's what the white man wants.

01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:42.444
Look at you, putting all
that poison in your hair.

01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:47.085
I think you been in prison too long.
Everybody on the outside conks.

01:06:47.286 --> 01:06:49.584
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:52.917
They don't want to walk around
with a nappy head, looking like--

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:54.217
Looking like me?

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.791
Like a nigger?

01:06:57.296 --> 01:06:59.025
Why not look like what you are?

01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:01.756
What makes you ashamed of being black?

01:07:01.967 --> 01:07:05.425
Let me tell you something.
I'm not ashamed of being anything.

01:07:09.408 --> 01:07:11.535
You better let go.
I gotta wash this out.

01:07:11.744 --> 01:07:14.736
-Let it burn!
-Nigger, get your hands off of me!

01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:17.872
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

01:07:18.084 --> 01:07:21.918
Put all that poison in your hair,
in your body, trying to be white!

01:07:23.856 --> 01:07:27.121
-I don't want to hear this.
-I thought you were smart.

01:07:27.326 --> 01:07:29.726
But you just another cat
strutting down the avenue...

01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:32.124
...in your clown suit
with all that mess on you!

01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:33.557
Looking like a monkey!

01:07:33.766 --> 01:07:37.725
The white man sees you and laughs
because he knows you ain't white.

01:07:37.937 --> 01:07:38.801
Who are you?

01:07:39.004 --> 01:07:41.268
The question is, who are you?

01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:43.937
I'll tell you.

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.940
You are lost in the darkness.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:51.643
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:52.613
Who?

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:54.513
Elijah Muhammad...

01:07:54.787 --> 01:07:57.278
...can get you out of prison.

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.454
Out of the prison of your mind.

01:08:01.293 --> 01:08:04.285
But maybe all you want is another fix.

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:22.439
--You get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

01:08:22.648 --> 01:08:25.481
You stop thinking and acting
for yourself.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.779
If you had to scrounge 3 squares a day,
you'd cut your throats.

01:08:30.122 --> 01:08:33.421
So you let them feed you,
give you dominoes to play with.

01:08:33.626 --> 01:08:37.062
-Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
-Let's go. Cut the sermon.

01:08:37.263 --> 01:08:41.096
He blows his whistle and you sit,
you stand, you grab, gobble...

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.323
...file out...

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.662
...sleep, and sing out your number.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.701
I told you to knock it off.

01:08:48.974 --> 01:08:49.941
Now...

01:08:50.142 --> 01:08:51.871
...are you gonna take yard?

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.377
I'm staying.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.147
Me too.

01:09:08.327 --> 01:09:10.352
What are you sniffing around for?

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.225
I told you, I gave you your last fix.

01:09:17.036 --> 01:09:18.731
What's your angle, nigger?

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:23.033
"Nigger"?
Who's wearing the conk?

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:26.871
You the only cat in this prison
I done seen act like you do.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.772
You ain't even afraid of the guards.

01:09:30.983 --> 01:09:33.611
What's he gonna do to me
he hasn't done already?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.787
I mean, you don't cuss none. You don't
talk that "What-ya-know-daddy" jive.

01:09:39.992 --> 01:09:43.859
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

01:09:49.201 --> 01:09:51.863
I know you got a angle
some kind of way.

01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:54.202
Don't con me.

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.540
Don't con me and don't try.

01:10:00.212 --> 01:10:03.613
Hey, just offering you a cigarette,
my man. Ain't no big deal.

01:10:09.588 --> 01:10:11.613
I read, study.

01:10:11.891 --> 01:10:14.792
The first thing a black man
must have is self-respect.

01:10:14.994 --> 01:10:17.189
Respect his body and his mind.

01:10:17.396 --> 01:10:19.990
Quit taking the white man's
poisons into his body.

01:10:20.232 --> 01:10:24.896
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor,
his white women, his pork.

01:10:25.738 --> 01:10:26.727
Pork?

01:10:31.043 --> 01:10:33.307
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

01:10:33.512 --> 01:10:37.949
Your mama was right.
A pig is a filthy beast.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.586
Part rat, part cat
and the rest is dog.

01:10:41.787 --> 01:10:44.153
All right, pull my coat on this now.

01:10:44.356 --> 01:10:46.551
What happen if you give all that up?

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:50.462
I mean, the pork. You get sick
and you get a medical or something?

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:54.155
Like when I was on the outside,
I ran this hustle. I tried--

01:10:54.366 --> 01:10:57.699
I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

01:10:57.903 --> 01:10:59.598
And I'm gonna tell you...

01:10:59.805 --> 01:11:00.772
...God is black.

01:11:00.973 --> 01:11:03.840
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:08.002
You accepted everything the white man
taught. He said you were a heathen...

01:11:08.213 --> 01:11:12.274
...and you believed him.
He said Jesus was blond and blue-eyed...

01:11:12.484 --> 01:11:13.451
...with white skin...

01:11:13.652 --> 01:11:15.051
...and you believed him.

01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:18.656
He said that black was a curse
and you believed that.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:21.382
-Ever look up the word "black"?
-For what?

01:11:21.593 --> 01:11:23.925
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't a con?

01:11:24.129 --> 01:11:25.653
What the hell for, man?

01:11:28.734 --> 01:11:29.530
Come with me.

01:11:33.339 --> 01:11:35.933
"Black: Destitute of light...

01:11:36.141 --> 01:11:37.506
...devoid of color.

01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:39.501
Enveloped in darkness...

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:42.078
...hence utterly dismal or gloomy...

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.140
...as, 'The future looked black.' "

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.180
Pretty good with them words.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:47.712
"Soiled with dirt...

01:11:48.153 --> 01:11:49.142
...foul.

01:11:49.355 --> 01:11:50.083
Sullen...

01:11:50.289 --> 01:11:51.085
...hostile...

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:54.316
...forbidding, as, 'a black day.'

01:11:55.094 --> 01:11:57.892
Foully or outrageously wicked...

01:11:58.097 --> 01:11:59.655
...as, 'black cruelty.'

01:11:59.865 --> 01:12:03.596
Indicating disgrace,
dishonor or culpability."

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:08.036
And there's others.
"Blackmail. Blackball. Blackguard."

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.673
That's something, all right.

01:12:10.109 --> 01:12:11.667
Let's look up "white."

01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:16.172
Here.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.348
Read.

01:12:21.286 --> 01:12:22.218
"White:

01:12:23.389 --> 01:12:25.448
The color of pure snow.

01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:29.692
Reflecting all the rays
of the spectrum.

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:31.355
The opposite of black.

01:12:36.635 --> 01:12:39.035
Free from spot or blemish.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:42.733
Innocent. Pure."

01:12:47.046 --> 01:12:49.606
Ain't this something?
"Without evil intent.

01:12:49.815 --> 01:12:50.975
Harmless.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.179
Honest, square-dealing...

01:12:53.385 --> 01:12:55.046
...and honorable."
Wait a minute.

01:12:55.254 --> 01:12:58.485
This was written by white folks, though.

01:12:58.724 --> 01:13:01.318
-Sure ain't no black man's book.
-So why read it?

01:13:01.527 --> 01:13:04.223
So you can read the truth
behind the words.

01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:08.560
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

01:13:13.005 --> 01:13:15.235
There's a whole lot of words in here.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.402
Here. Let's start at the beginning.

01:13:18.944 --> 01:13:22.903
We'll look them up, write them down
and find out what they mean.

01:13:23.182 --> 01:13:26.174
Page one. The first word: "Aardvark."

01:13:30.122 --> 01:13:31.248
"Aardvark.

01:13:31.457 --> 01:13:34.358
Earth pig.
African, ant-eating mammal.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.226
Abacus:

01:13:36.428 --> 01:13:40.091
Chinese calculating instrument.

01:13:42.534 --> 01:13:43.660
Abaddon:

01:13:43.869 --> 01:13:47.327
The place of the lost in Sheol.

01:13:47.539 --> 01:13:48.938
The bottomless pit."

01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:51.666
If you take one step toward Allah...

01:13:51.877 --> 01:13:53.868
...he'll take two steps toward you.

01:13:59.218 --> 01:14:00.617
Lights out!

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.422
Boy'll wear out a baseball.

01:14:42.327 --> 01:14:44.352
-What's the score, my man?
-10 to 1.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:47.157
We're murdering them!
Didn't you hear?

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:48.331
No. What happened?

01:14:48.534 --> 01:14:52.766
The Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson!
We're pouding them, celebrating!

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.700
That's all right.

01:14:55.307 --> 01:14:56.205
Sure.

01:14:56.942 --> 01:15:00.070
White man throw us a bone
and we're supposed to forget...

01:15:00.279 --> 01:15:01.871
...400 years of oppression.

01:15:02.614 --> 01:15:04.104
Yeah, but a nigger--

01:15:05.184 --> 01:15:07.618
A Negro in the big leagues,
that's something.

01:15:07.786 --> 01:15:11.119
I told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

01:15:11.456 --> 01:15:14.357
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

01:15:14.826 --> 01:15:17.818
...and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:20.624
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:23.925
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

01:15:24.136 --> 01:15:27.367
...one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

01:15:27.573 --> 01:15:28.972
...tortured us...

01:15:29.174 --> 01:15:33.008
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history....

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.112
Let me tell you about black history.

01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:39.910
We are the original man.

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:43.178
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

01:15:43.388 --> 01:15:46.186
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:49.016
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

01:15:49.228 --> 01:15:52.561
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

01:15:52.764 --> 01:15:55.324
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

01:15:55.534 --> 01:15:57.627
...crawled on all fours in Europe.

01:15:57.836 --> 01:15:59.895
Do they know who they are?

01:16:01.907 --> 01:16:04.705
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

01:16:04.943 --> 01:16:05.807
Malcolm Little.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:10.210
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

01:16:11.016 --> 01:16:13.007
You don't even know who you are.

01:16:13.218 --> 01:16:15.846
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

01:16:16.054 --> 01:16:17.544
Who are you?

01:16:21.093 --> 01:16:23.288
Look, I ain't--
Shit!

01:16:27.466 --> 01:16:30.435
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little.
Or Red. Or Satan.

01:16:30.636 --> 01:16:32.160
That's right.
So who are you?

01:16:36.808 --> 01:16:39.140
-I don't know.
-We are a nation...

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.411
...of the tribe of Shabazz...

01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:45.276
...lost in this wilderness called
North America.

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:54.255
Tribe of Shabazz.

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:56.893
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

01:16:57.095 --> 01:16:59.359
...a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

01:16:59.831 --> 01:17:03.323
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

01:17:03.602 --> 01:17:07.595
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:09.431
...is righteousness.

01:17:09.908 --> 01:17:12.308
If the black man's nature
is righteousness....

01:17:12.511 --> 01:17:15.241
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

01:17:15.447 --> 01:17:17.005
I knew you'd get it.

01:17:17.282 --> 01:17:21.116
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.788
I sure met some in my life.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:30.023
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

01:17:30.462 --> 01:17:33.863
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

01:17:34.466 --> 01:17:38.630
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:42.133
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:51.943
<i>The body is a sacred temple...</i>

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.414
<i>...it must be purified.</i>

01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:58.820
I will not touch
the white man's poison:

01:17:59.024 --> 01:18:00.423
His drugs...

01:18:00.859 --> 01:18:02.326
...his liquor...

01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:05.523
...his swine...

01:18:05.731 --> 01:18:06.823
...his women.

01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:10.328
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

01:18:10.569 --> 01:18:12.366
...an outstanding example...

01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:16.029
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

01:18:18.176 --> 01:18:21.407
I will not commit
adultery or fornication.

01:18:23.014 --> 01:18:24.641
I will not lie...

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.579
...cheat or steal.

01:18:27.919 --> 01:18:30.353
But the key to Islam is submission.

01:18:34.926 --> 01:18:38.384
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

01:18:38.597 --> 01:18:41.088
...to bend our knees in submission.

01:18:44.703 --> 01:18:47.035
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:49.834
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:51.531
...to admit their guilt.

01:18:51.743 --> 01:18:56.442
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

01:19:02.387 --> 01:19:04.719
The hardest and the greatest.

01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:12.394
I don't know
what I would say to Allah.

01:19:12.964 --> 01:19:15.398
Have you ever bent your knees?

01:19:18.236 --> 01:19:20.227
Yes, when I was...

01:19:21.306 --> 01:19:23.797
...picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.271
Tell Allah that.

01:19:36.922 --> 01:19:40.915
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

01:19:41.126 --> 01:19:43.151
Pick the lock.
Pick it.

01:19:43.762 --> 01:19:45.423
I want to.

01:19:49.134 --> 01:19:51.068
God knows I want to.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:05.813
<i>I received a letter that day</i>
<i>from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.</i>

01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:08.279
<i>The dear Holy Apostle</i>
<i>wrote to me...</i>

01:20:08.487 --> 01:20:11.320
<i>...a nobody, a junkie, a pimp</i>
<i>and a convict.</i>

01:20:11.523 --> 01:20:14.492
<i>I have come to give you...</i>

01:20:14.926 --> 01:20:18.589
<i>...something which can</i>
<i>never be taken away from you.</i>

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:23.767
<i>I bring to you</i>
<i>a sense of your own worth...</i>

01:20:24.603 --> 01:20:27.367
<i>...the worth of one human being.</i>

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:30.063
<i>The knowledge of self.</i>

01:20:30.275 --> 01:20:34.575
<i>It was like a blinding light. I was</i>
<i>aware that he was in the room with me.</i>

01:20:35.113 --> 01:20:38.082
<i>He wore a dark suit,</i>
<i>and on his face I saw a wisdom...</i>

01:20:38.283 --> 01:20:41.946
<i>...and pain so old and deep</i>
<i>that I could scarcely look at him.</i>

01:20:42.954 --> 01:20:45.718
<i>But I knew I wasn't dreaming.</i>
<i>He was there with me.</i>

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.789
<i>I tell you...</i>

01:20:49.194 --> 01:20:52.527
<i>...the most dangerous creation</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

01:20:52.864 --> 01:20:55.128
<i>...in any society...</i>

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.294
<i>...is the man with nothing to lose.</i>

01:20:58.537 --> 01:21:03.474
<i>You do not need 10 such men</i>
<i>to change the world.</i>

01:21:04.376 --> 01:21:06.367
<i>One will do.</i>

01:21:07.479 --> 01:21:10.380
<i>The earth belongs to us...</i>

01:21:10.582 --> 01:21:11.981
<i>...the black man.</i>

01:21:12.317 --> 01:21:14.683
<i>And whatever is around it...</i>

01:21:14.886 --> 01:21:17.878
<i>...or on it, or in it...</i>

01:21:18.156 --> 01:21:20.181
<i>...belongs to us.</i>

01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:22.553
<i>And then as suddenly as he came...</i>

01:21:22.761 --> 01:21:23.887
<i>...he was gone.</i>

01:21:26.031 --> 01:21:27.589
<i>And then I could do it.</i>

01:21:30.502 --> 01:21:31.799
<i>We're taught that Paul...</i>

01:21:32.003 --> 01:21:35.370
<i>...on the road to Damascus,</i>
<i>heard the voice of Christ.</i>

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.609
<i>He was so smitten by the truth</i>
<i>that he fell from his horse.</i>

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.971
<i>Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...</i>

01:21:41.246 --> 01:21:42.907
<i>...but I do understand.</i>

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:46.040
<i>You see, it happened to me.</i>

01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:47.343
Why me?

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:53.818
<i>Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back</i>
<i>in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.</i>

01:21:54.092 --> 01:21:57.357
<i>We don't have much,</i>
<i>but what we have is yours.</i>

01:21:57.562 --> 01:22:01.464
<i>My wife and my son join me in saying</i>
<i>that when you come out...</i>

01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:03.998
<i>...which won't be long,</i>
<i>come straight to us.</i>

01:22:04.202 --> 01:22:05.169
Next.

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:12.999
What'll it be?

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:16.078
Take it all off.

01:22:16.281 --> 01:22:18.772
-Getting rid of that conk, huh?
-Yes, sir.

01:22:20.285 --> 01:22:22.344
<i>You write, thanking me.</i>

01:22:23.288 --> 01:22:27.520
<i>Don't thank me, thank Allah.</i>
<i>He did it all.</i>

01:22:30.228 --> 01:22:31.855
<i>Dear Brother Baines:</i>

01:22:32.597 --> 01:22:35.191
<i>Please thank Elijah Muhammad</i>
<i>for the money...</i>

01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:38.266
<i>...and tell him</i>
<i>I haven't written him...</i>

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:40.438
<i>...because I've</i>
<i>not yet proven myself.</i>

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:44.871
<i>But I have shared his teachings</i>
<i>with old running buddies in Harlem...</i>

01:22:45.076 --> 01:22:48.512
<i>...and with my main man, Shorty,</i>
<i>who was transferred upstate.</i>

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:49.975
He's gone nuts.

01:22:50.181 --> 01:22:51.614
"Dear Brothers:

01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:54.544
I thank you for
your time and concern.

01:22:55.453 --> 01:22:59.389
All praises due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:02.420
I wrote the mayor, the governor
and the President...

01:23:02.627 --> 01:23:05.926
...but for some reason
I haven't heard from them."

01:23:07.165 --> 01:23:08.826
<i>Please tell Elijah...</i>

01:23:09.034 --> 01:23:13.664
<i>...I have dedicated my life to telling</i>
<i>the white devil the truth to his face.</i>

01:23:13.872 --> 01:23:17.933
<i>I greet you with the ancient words</i>
<i>of peace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum. "</i>

01:23:18.543 --> 01:23:21.774
<i>P.S. I finally copied out the</i>
<i>entire dictionary.</i>

01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:26.612
I think the brother is coming along.

01:23:28.186 --> 01:23:31.883
"The thief cometh not
but for to steal...

01:23:32.157 --> 01:23:35.820
...and to kill, and to destroy.

01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:37.822
But I am come...

01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:40.125
...that they might have life...

01:23:40.899 --> 01:23:44.391
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

01:23:45.904 --> 01:23:49.704
Saint John 10, verse 10.
Are there any questions?

01:23:54.045 --> 01:23:56.741
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:01.914
I see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.417
"Satan" has a question.

01:24:04.589 --> 01:24:07.114
Yes, sir. But since
neither of us are God...

01:24:07.325 --> 01:24:10.419
...neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:11.856
Just ask your question.

01:24:12.063 --> 01:24:15.726
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

01:24:15.934 --> 01:24:18.425
Well, I don't think...

01:24:18.903 --> 01:24:20.234
...we know for certain.

01:24:20.438 --> 01:24:22.497
-But they were Hebrews?
-That's right.

01:24:22.707 --> 01:24:24.766
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:27.510
Just ask your question.

01:24:27.712 --> 01:24:29.145
What color were the Hebrews?

01:24:29.347 --> 01:24:32.805
I have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

01:24:33.017 --> 01:24:37.113
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:39.620
Just a moment. Just a moment.

01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:43.761
God is white.
Isn't it obvious?

01:24:43.962 --> 01:24:46.795
That's obvious, but it's
not obvious that God is white.

01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:48.590
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.394
...that Jesus didn't have
blond hair and blue eyes.

01:24:51.603 --> 01:24:54.163
Elijah Muhammad teaches that
images of Jesus...

01:24:54.372 --> 01:24:57.170
...in prisons and churches
throughout the world...

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:59.070
...are not historically correct.

01:24:59.277 --> 01:25:00.972
Because history teaches us...

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.342
...Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:07.074
There's proof in the Bible
you ask us to read...

01:25:07.285 --> 01:25:10.152
...in Revelations, chapter 1,
verses 14 and 15...

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.255
...that Jesus had hair like wool...

01:25:12.457 --> 01:25:14.254
...and feet the color of brass.

01:25:14.459 --> 01:25:17.053
-What're you saying?
-I'm not saying anything.

01:25:17.262 --> 01:25:21.221
I'm proving to you that Jesus was not,
to quote an Indian brother...

01:25:21.432 --> 01:25:23.923
...he was not a paleface.

01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:26.595
Amen.

01:25:27.405 --> 01:25:29.134
Isn't that interesting!

01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:33.941
Brother Malcolm.

01:25:34.279 --> 01:25:35.610
Brother Malcolm.

01:25:37.048 --> 01:25:39.107
He's waiting for you.

01:26:23.895 --> 01:26:25.658
My son....

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.493
You have been a thief...

01:26:32.237 --> 01:26:35.070
...a drug dealer and a hustler...

01:26:36.507 --> 01:26:39.499
...and the world
is still full of temptation.

01:26:44.182 --> 01:26:48.881
When God spoke to the devil about
how faithful Job was...

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.417
...the devil argued...

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:53.716
...that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

01:26:53.925 --> 01:26:56.291
...that kept him pure.

01:26:56.895 --> 01:26:58.385
In fact, the devil said:

01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:03.158
"Remove that hedge
and he will curse his Maker."

01:27:04.769 --> 01:27:06.031
Well, Malcolm...

01:27:07.772 --> 01:27:10.707
...your hedge has been removed.

01:27:13.211 --> 01:27:15.702
And I believe...

01:27:17.048 --> 01:27:18.106
...you...

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:20.745
...will remain faithful.

01:27:21.419 --> 01:27:22.716
Yes, sir.

01:27:27.191 --> 01:27:28.249
Thank you, sister.

01:27:28.459 --> 01:27:30.086
How many of these should we make?

01:27:30.295 --> 01:27:31.922
-Five hundred.
-Make it 1000.

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:36.331
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

01:27:38.803 --> 01:27:41.636
Brother Earl's dedicated.
We need good men like him.

01:27:41.973 --> 01:27:45.136
I'm a willing servant for
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:47.241
Go ahead, brothers.
IKeep it busy.

01:27:47.845 --> 01:27:50.541
Take a real good look
at not just where you live...

01:27:50.748 --> 01:27:54.047
...but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives.

01:27:54.252 --> 01:27:57.551
I don't want you to think
you're some bad-luck accident.

01:27:57.755 --> 01:28:00.781
Then I want you to go downtown,
to Central Park West....

01:28:03.928 --> 01:28:05.225
Go in other communities....

01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:08.365
You've never seen
a Booker T. Washington store...

01:28:08.566 --> 01:28:09.999
...in an Italian community.

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:13.295
You've never seen no
Frederick Douglass delicatessen...

01:28:13.504 --> 01:28:14.835
...in the Jewish community.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:18.566
Why's everybody in this community
making money but us?

01:28:18.776 --> 01:28:21.768
It's time for black men and women
to stand up...

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.005
...and take control of our dollars.

01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:28.049
It's time for us to use our dollars
for our liberation.

01:28:28.252 --> 01:28:31.710
We can do what everyone else can
if we become producers...

01:28:31.923 --> 01:28:34.892
...and if we become
the masters of our own destiny.

01:28:35.093 --> 01:28:37.823
We can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else.

01:28:38.029 --> 01:28:39.929
But where are our clothing stores?

01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:44.431
We can get milk from cows,
but where are our grocery stores?

01:28:44.635 --> 01:28:48.503
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

01:28:48.706 --> 01:28:51.800
The only thing they respect
is our dollars!

01:28:54.012 --> 01:28:56.344
--The so-called freedom
we should have.

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:58.742
The Statue of Liberty
stands like this.

01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:02.113
For us, it may as well say,
"Stop, don't come no further."

01:29:03.688 --> 01:29:05.485
"Don't come no further."

01:29:05.690 --> 01:29:07.817
Brothers and sisters,
I want you to....

01:29:08.026 --> 01:29:10.119
I want you to come down
to the temple.

01:29:10.328 --> 01:29:11.989
Oh, I'm so surprised!

01:29:12.196 --> 01:29:15.290
I'm so surprised.
You all been in church two hours...

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:19.231
...expecting to see heaven,
but you're still here on earth.

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:22.031
Why don't you come on down
to the temple at 2:00?

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.470
You'll hear truth,
the black man's truth.

01:29:24.675 --> 01:29:28.577
No, you can't deny it.
You been on your knees for hours...

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.044
...begging some God to help you
in the hereafter.

01:29:31.249 --> 01:29:34.776
But the hereafter is right now.
The hereafter is here and now.

01:29:34.986 --> 01:29:36.715
Let me talk to you, brother.

01:29:36.921 --> 01:29:39.788
I know you're a smart man
and a wise man.

01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:40.923
You look good.

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:44.583
Now, you're in church every day,
praying to this God.

01:29:44.829 --> 01:29:46.888
But these so-called white Christians...

01:29:47.098 --> 01:29:49.498
...hang our black Christians
from trees.

01:29:49.834 --> 01:29:53.292
This man hates you.
He doesn't do anything for you.

01:29:53.504 --> 01:29:55.836
He tells you to foam at
the mouth and sing...

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.440
...and hope for something
in the hereafter.

01:29:58.643 --> 01:29:59.905
We can have it now.

01:30:00.111 --> 01:30:02.341
-Come on down, 2:00.
-See you later.

01:30:02.547 --> 01:30:05.778
As-Salaam-Alaikum
That means, "Peace be unto you."

01:30:05.983 --> 01:30:09.043
We have two children.
Carla, who's two, and....

01:30:09.253 --> 01:30:11.983
Don't be ashamed when I call
you black. You are.

01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:15.182
You're black and you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

01:30:15.393 --> 01:30:18.760
You don't have to come here
begging these folks for a job.

01:30:18.963 --> 01:30:21.932
You can wash their clothes
and scrub floors for them.

01:30:22.133 --> 01:30:25.330
You can rock their little
brats to sleep your whole life.

01:30:25.536 --> 01:30:27.094
You'll still end up poor.

01:30:27.305 --> 01:30:30.297
Yet you're here on the auction block
being examined...

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:32.669
...like you're a horse or a slave.

01:30:32.877 --> 01:30:35.903
You see this here?
This is who you are. Beautiful.

01:30:36.114 --> 01:30:39.709
Your beautiful black selves,
with pride and dignity.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.346
I'd also expect you to work one
Saturday every month...

01:30:45.556 --> 01:30:48.286
...and occasionally in the evening--

01:30:53.998 --> 01:30:57.934
See, these are the questions
you and I have to ask:

01:30:58.136 --> 01:30:59.603
"How did we get this mind?"

01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:03.638
You're not an American, but an African
who happens to be in America.

01:31:03.908 --> 01:31:05.637
You must understand the difference.

01:31:05.843 --> 01:31:09.335
We didn't come over on the <i>Niña,</i>
the <i>Pinta</i> and the whatchamacallit.

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:13.346
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:16.243
Landed right on top of us.

01:31:18.856 --> 01:31:19.823
Shorty?

01:31:20.925 --> 01:31:22.483
Is that you, brother?

01:31:22.693 --> 01:31:26.629
Now, this is exactly what I'm talking
about, the slave mentality...

01:31:26.831 --> 01:31:27.889
...the slave mind.

01:31:28.099 --> 01:31:29.999
This brother and I had
the slave mind.

01:31:30.201 --> 01:31:33.102
We used to rob together.
We slept with white women.

01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:34.965
We even went to prison together.

01:31:35.173 --> 01:31:38.199
Don't be surprised.
Some of you are still in prison...

01:31:38.442 --> 01:31:39.807
...prisons of your mind.

01:31:40.011 --> 01:31:41.706
Stand up, brother.
Come on.

01:31:43.281 --> 01:31:45.146
The brother's a little shy.

01:31:45.349 --> 01:31:47.510
Come on, brother.
Give me a hug.

01:31:49.554 --> 01:31:51.112
That's all right, brother.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.558
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:57.523
That's the slave mind.

01:31:57.728 --> 01:32:00.856
Red, that's the best preacher hype
I ever did hear.

01:32:01.065 --> 01:32:02.930
No hype, brother.
It's the truth.

01:32:03.134 --> 01:32:05.193
Come back to the temple
and hear more.

01:32:05.403 --> 01:32:07.166
I can't pay that shit no mind.

01:32:07.371 --> 01:32:09.771
You need to pay it all your mind.
What's left.

01:32:09.974 --> 01:32:12.374
Take it easy.
This is me. Shorty.

01:32:12.577 --> 01:32:14.272
Let's go around the corner....

01:32:15.813 --> 01:32:19.146
No, sir. Not anymore.
I've been clean for eight years.

01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:20.977
-Eight years?
-Eight years.

01:32:21.185 --> 01:32:25.212
My trouble is, I love pigs feet
and white women too much.

01:32:25.489 --> 01:32:27.719
So I damn sure can't be no Muslim.

01:32:27.925 --> 01:32:31.827
That's because you're lost, brother.
That's because you're lost.

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:33.991
But we can find you.

01:32:38.269 --> 01:32:40.260
What do you hear about
the old gang?

01:32:40.838 --> 01:32:42.328
You heard about Sammy?

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:47.077
<i>Dead. Knocked over in bed with</i>
<i>a chick 25 years younger than he was.</i>

01:32:47.278 --> 01:32:52.215
<i>Had 25 grand in his pocket, also.</i>
Guess it was his lucky number.

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:55.344
What about....

01:32:55.553 --> 01:32:56.747
What was his name?

01:32:56.954 --> 01:32:58.387
Cadillac?

01:32:58.589 --> 01:32:59.647
Gone too?

01:32:59.857 --> 01:33:04.021
<i>Hooked on heroin. Been in and out</i>
<i>of Lexington five or six times.</i>

01:33:04.228 --> 01:33:05.058
Sophia?

01:33:05.263 --> 01:33:07.663
Still happily married
to that rich ofay.

01:33:07.865 --> 01:33:10.026
-<i>She married him?</i>
-<i>She married him.</i>

01:33:10.468 --> 01:33:11.958
<i>Went for the money.</i>

01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:14.738
-<i>The money.</i>
-<i>Thank you, honey.</i>

01:33:16.307 --> 01:33:18.104
I haven't seen
West Indian Archie.

01:33:18.309 --> 01:33:21.176
<i>Grapevine says</i>
<i>he's living in the Bronx.</i>

01:33:21.379 --> 01:33:23.279
<i>If you wanna call that living.</i>

01:33:23.481 --> 01:33:25.244
<i>It's been good seeing you.</i>

01:33:25.449 --> 01:33:27.041
<i>Same here, Red.</i>

01:33:33.457 --> 01:33:38.156
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:44.167
I'll pay you tomorrow!

01:33:58.683 --> 01:33:59.843
How you doing, Archie?

01:34:00.351 --> 01:34:02.182
My man, Red.

01:34:04.855 --> 01:34:06.345
Come here, man.

01:34:10.695 --> 01:34:12.925
No, don't get up.
It's all right.

01:34:20.705 --> 01:34:22.036
Is...

01:34:24.108 --> 01:34:25.939
...really you, Red?

01:34:27.044 --> 01:34:28.443
Yes, it's me.

01:34:32.883 --> 01:34:34.612
I came to...

01:34:35.453 --> 01:34:37.045
...just to thank you...

01:34:38.889 --> 01:34:40.584
...for saving my life.

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:44.352
When I think back to when
we were in Harlem trying to...

01:34:44.695 --> 01:34:46.094
...gun each other down--

01:34:46.297 --> 01:34:48.527
I wasn't going to shoot you, man.

01:34:50.134 --> 01:34:51.123
It was...

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:53.293
...just my rep.

01:34:54.238 --> 01:34:55.227
You know?

01:34:56.674 --> 01:34:59.472
All I had was my rep.

01:35:01.145 --> 01:35:02.237
But now...

01:35:04.615 --> 01:35:05.912
...you tell me this.

01:35:06.417 --> 01:35:09.580
You did really have that number?

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:13.252
I don't know, Archie....

01:35:13.591 --> 01:35:15.616
I don't remember,
and it's not important.

01:35:15.826 --> 01:35:19.660
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

01:35:21.098 --> 01:35:23.589
You know, I have some angles...

01:35:25.569 --> 01:35:27.366
...ain't been figured yet.

01:35:35.346 --> 01:35:36.472
It's all right.

01:35:41.485 --> 01:35:43.510
Help me with my arm.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:47.287
I need to exercise my arm.

01:35:54.799 --> 01:35:56.096
That's better?

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.598
Yep.
It feels good.

01:35:58.803 --> 01:36:00.862
Good.

01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:09.278
<i>What happened to our women?</i>
<i>They could've been doctors, lawyers...</i>

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.677
<i>...or teachers or mothers.</i>
<i>Who'll raise our children?</i>

01:36:12.883 --> 01:36:14.441
<i>What happened to our men?</i>

01:36:14.652 --> 01:36:18.850
<i>Men who could've been mathematicians,</i>
<i>electricians, physicians.</i>

01:36:19.056 --> 01:36:21.422
<i>What's the little boy gonna do...</i>

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:24.685
<i>...when he's looking for his father</i>
<i>who's in jail?</i>

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.291
<i>What'll the girl do...</i>

01:36:26.497 --> 01:36:30.331
<i>...when she's looking for her mother</i>
<i>who's out selling herself?</i>

01:36:30.534 --> 01:36:35.369
<i>I'm telling you, that devil has made</i>
<i>dead souls out of you and I.</i>

01:36:35.773 --> 01:36:37.365
<i>You're dead, spiritually.</i>

01:36:37.575 --> 01:36:41.306
<i>You're dead to the knowledge</i>
<i>of yourself and your people...</i>

01:36:41.512 --> 01:36:43.810
<i>...and to the knowledge</i>
<i>of your God.</i>

01:36:44.014 --> 01:36:47.142
<i>Why, he should get down on his knees.</i>

01:36:47.351 --> 01:36:48.477
<i>He should beg our mercy.</i>

01:36:49.353 --> 01:36:50.911
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

01:36:51.121 --> 01:36:53.749
...his kind has committed
God's greatest crime...

01:36:53.958 --> 01:36:57.485
...against your and my kind
every day of his life!

01:36:57.695 --> 01:37:01.392
He should get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime.

01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:02.657
But does he do that?

01:37:02.867 --> 01:37:05.995
Does he do that?
No, no, he scorns you.

01:37:06.203 --> 01:37:08.398
He splits your head with
his nightstick.

01:37:08.606 --> 01:37:11.200
He busts you in the head
with his billy club.

01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:13.069
And he calls you a nigger...

01:37:13.277 --> 01:37:17.145
...a coon. That's what he says to you.
"Boy!" "Nigger!"

01:37:17.348 --> 01:37:19.339
Four hundred years is long enough.

01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:23.008
You've sat down and laid down
and bowed down for 400 years.

01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.917
I think it's time to stand up.
I think it's time to stand up.

01:37:27.124 --> 01:37:28.955
-We're with you!
-All right.

01:37:29.159 --> 01:37:30.091
Bless you.

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:39.797
Glory! My Lord!
Praise Him!

01:37:54.018 --> 01:37:55.883
Yes, sir.
Next Wednesday, 8:00.

01:37:56.086 --> 01:37:57.485
I'll see you there.

01:37:58.756 --> 01:38:00.781
Brother Baines?
Excuse me, sister.

01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:04.051
Do you think we can get
a loudspeaker set up outside?

01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:05.489
I'm sure we can.

01:38:05.696 --> 01:38:07.789
Brother Malcolm,
this is Sister Betty.

01:38:07.998 --> 01:38:10.728
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

01:38:10.935 --> 01:38:14.063
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

01:38:14.338 --> 01:38:15.532
Good.

01:38:15.739 --> 01:38:18.503
-As-Salaam-Alaikum.
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

01:38:20.244 --> 01:38:21.734
Brother Minister...

01:38:21.946 --> 01:38:25.382
...the sister wonders if you know
what Harriet Tubman did...

01:38:25.583 --> 01:38:28.575
...between taking souls to the
Promised Land?

01:38:28.786 --> 01:38:31.016
No. What's that, sister?

01:38:32.356 --> 01:38:33.789
She ate.

01:38:37.194 --> 01:38:38.525
Excuse me.

01:38:47.638 --> 01:38:48.764
She's interesting.

01:38:48.973 --> 01:38:52.340
Minister, I was hoping
you'd come and speak to my class.

01:38:53.611 --> 01:38:55.476
Yes, I'll speak to your class.

01:38:56.313 --> 01:38:59.077
-But I'm a hard man on the women.
-Are you?

01:38:59.817 --> 01:39:02.342
We must be very careful
when it comes to women.

01:39:02.553 --> 01:39:04.885
Too many of our women...

01:39:05.956 --> 01:39:07.947
...have too much
of the devil in them.

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:10.486
Bleaching and dyeing...

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:14.327
...and ironing their hair.

01:39:15.332 --> 01:39:19.359
Running around
in the streets half-naked.

01:39:21.438 --> 01:39:22.700
Talking too much.

01:39:22.906 --> 01:39:24.533
Listening to the wrong men...

01:39:24.742 --> 01:39:28.303
...making them
deceitful, untrustworthy, fresh.

01:39:28.512 --> 01:39:30.844
And you men are to blame too.

01:39:31.048 --> 01:39:34.916
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

01:39:35.486 --> 01:39:37.181
See, the building of
a new nation...

01:39:38.255 --> 01:39:40.086
...begins with the woman.

01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:42.354
Because the mother...

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.194
...is the first teacher of the child.

01:39:45.429 --> 01:39:49.126
The message she gives that child,
the child gives to the world.

01:39:49.933 --> 01:39:53.334
When it comes to choosing a mate...

01:39:53.871 --> 01:39:58.240
...Samson, the strongest man
that ever lived, was destroyed...

01:39:58.442 --> 01:40:00.933
...by the woman
that slept in his arms.

01:40:01.145 --> 01:40:03.613
Should I tell my sisters, then...

01:40:03.881 --> 01:40:06.281
...that we don't believe in marriage?

01:40:06.483 --> 01:40:09.077
No, we don't oppose marriage.

01:40:09.286 --> 01:40:11.117
We're not Catholic priests.

01:40:11.321 --> 01:40:13.084
We don't believe in celibacy.

01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:15.554
Mr. Muhammad teaches
that if a woman...

01:40:15.759 --> 01:40:18.489
...is the right height
and complexion for a man--

01:40:18.696 --> 01:40:20.027
If she's...

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:21.993
...half the man's age, plus seven.

01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:25.855
And if...

01:40:26.066 --> 01:40:30.696
...she understands that man's
essential nature is strong...

01:40:31.038 --> 01:40:33.063
...and she's
willing to support that.

01:40:33.607 --> 01:40:35.131
And if she...

01:40:35.642 --> 01:40:38.076
...can sew and cook and...

01:40:38.645 --> 01:40:39.907
...loves children...

01:40:40.113 --> 01:40:42.172
...and stays out of trouble....

01:40:42.382 --> 01:40:45.442
I think you've made your points,
Brother Minister.

01:40:45.652 --> 01:40:46.619
Good.

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:49.288
You haven't any time for marriage.

01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:54.549
So what I'll do is
write the chapters down for you...

01:40:54.928 --> 01:40:55.792
All right.

01:40:55.996 --> 01:40:59.295
...as well as the New Testament
chapters in St. Matthew.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.897
Brother Minister....

01:41:01.101 --> 01:41:03.865
I hope you'll still
come visit my class, though.

01:41:04.071 --> 01:41:07.063
No, I'd love to come to your class.
I love to teach.

01:41:07.407 --> 01:41:10.899
I love sharing. This is the wonderful
thing about Mr. Muhammad:

01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:15.445
When he gives you this knowledge,
you can't help but share it--

01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:18.413
Excuse me, Brother Minister...

01:41:18.619 --> 01:41:20.314
...would it be okay if we...

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.385
...just sat down for a moment?

01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:25.080
It's a big building and....

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.225
Sister, I'm sorry.
I've had you on your feet all day.

01:41:31.098 --> 01:41:32.258
My mistake.

01:41:32.466 --> 01:41:34.696
You've been on your feet for days.

01:41:35.736 --> 01:41:39.172
And you didn't even finish your salad.

01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:44.108
So let's talk about you
for a change.

01:41:44.645 --> 01:41:45.976
How tall are you?

01:41:47.547 --> 01:41:48.707
Why do you ask?

01:41:48.916 --> 01:41:50.144
Idle question.

01:41:50.717 --> 01:41:55.120
Well, if it's just an idle question,
I hope I'm not forced to answer.

01:41:56.123 --> 01:41:58.785
No, I won't force you.

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:07.425
Brother Baines says that
I'm tall enough for a tall man.

01:42:07.634 --> 01:42:09.465
He's briefed you also?

01:42:11.738 --> 01:42:13.296
How old are you, sister?

01:42:14.107 --> 01:42:17.372
You know, there are
a few things about women...

01:42:17.577 --> 01:42:19.568
...that you don't understand.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.079
Some of us, we're
quite possessive, very vain...

01:42:23.817 --> 01:42:27.150
...and persistent when
we've set our mind to something.

01:42:27.688 --> 01:42:30.156
What have you set your mind to?

01:42:32.292 --> 01:42:34.021
Being a good Muslim...

01:42:34.861 --> 01:42:36.590
...a good nurse...

01:42:38.365 --> 01:42:39.923
...and a good wife.

01:42:40.867 --> 01:42:42.164
Brother Malcolm?

01:42:42.369 --> 01:42:43.893
-Excuse me.
-Certainly.

01:42:44.104 --> 01:42:46.732
Brother Johnson was attacked
by the police.

01:42:48.775 --> 01:42:49.639
Excuse me.

01:42:49.843 --> 01:42:51.743
-A scuffle!
-He was just watching.

01:42:51.945 --> 01:42:55.244
-The cop said, "Move on!"
-He didn't move quick enough for him.

01:42:55.449 --> 01:42:57.679
Crack! He was bleeding
like a stuck hog.

01:42:57.884 --> 01:43:00.045
So what you gonna do?

01:43:00.754 --> 01:43:03.655
He'll rap a little.
He's a Muslim!

01:43:03.857 --> 01:43:06.792
But you ain't gonna do nothing
but make a speech.

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.525
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing...

01:43:10.998 --> 01:43:13.728
...unless somebody bothers Muslims.

01:43:34.521 --> 01:43:36.284
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:38.287
Who the hell are you?

01:43:38.492 --> 01:43:40.392
The minister
of Muslim Temple No. 7.

01:43:40.594 --> 01:43:42.255
Never heard of you.

01:43:42.496 --> 01:43:43.963
-Where is he?
-Not here.

01:43:44.164 --> 01:43:46.394
Wait a second.
What is your name?

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.898
Don't worry about what my name is.

01:43:49.102 --> 01:43:52.868
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here
beat up, but not brought out.

01:43:53.073 --> 01:43:56.201
You didn't hear the sergeant?
Outside!

01:43:56.410 --> 01:43:58.935
I suggest you look outside
that window.

01:44:10.257 --> 01:44:11.747
Jimmy, come here a second.

01:44:11.958 --> 01:44:14.358
We intend to see Brother Johnson.

01:44:15.162 --> 01:44:16.322
Who the hell are they?

01:44:16.530 --> 01:44:18.896
They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

01:44:23.003 --> 01:44:25.130
Eddie, let me take a look
at that blotter.

01:44:35.148 --> 01:44:37.514
We got a Muslim.
Relief must've put it down.

01:44:37.717 --> 01:44:39.708
-Must have.
-But you can't see him.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.855
-Because you ain't his lawyer.
-No lawyer, no see.

01:44:43.056 --> 01:44:47.425
Until I'm satisfied that Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

01:44:47.627 --> 01:44:49.288
...nobody will move.

01:45:04.344 --> 01:45:06.312
Get an ambulance. Now!

01:45:24.965 --> 01:45:27.058
Break it up. You got what you wanted.

01:45:27.267 --> 01:45:29.735
No, I'm not satisfied.

01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:31.668
To the hospital.

01:47:31.424 --> 01:47:34.587
We want justice!
We want justice!

01:47:35.295 --> 01:47:36.762
All right, that's enough.

01:47:36.963 --> 01:47:38.624
Move these people out of here.

01:47:38.832 --> 01:47:43.326
Fruit of Islam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws...yet.

01:47:43.536 --> 01:47:44.434
What about them?

01:47:44.638 --> 01:47:46.230
That's your headache.

01:47:46.439 --> 01:47:48.669
But if Brother Johnson dies,
I pity you.

01:47:50.110 --> 01:47:51.077
Doctor?

01:47:51.278 --> 01:47:53.746
He'll live. He's getting
the best care we have.

01:47:53.947 --> 01:47:55.073
-Thank you.
-Certainly.

01:47:56.216 --> 01:47:57.877
All right, okay.

01:47:58.285 --> 01:47:59.946
Now, let's disperse this mob!

01:48:52.806 --> 01:48:55.707
That's too much power
for one man to have.

01:48:55.909 --> 01:48:58.969
Brother Minister, I'm ready
to take some heads.

01:48:59.179 --> 01:49:01.409
We gotta do something
to put fear in those devils.

01:49:01.614 --> 01:49:05.880
I'm ready to do something also. The
word out of Chicago was to be patient.

01:49:06.086 --> 01:49:08.953
-I'm tired of being patient.
-Then you get on the phone--

01:49:09.756 --> 01:49:13.021
You get on the phone, call Chicago
and let Mr. Muhammad know.

01:49:30.276 --> 01:49:31.743
Have a seat, son.

01:49:35.382 --> 01:49:37.646
The only thing I like integrated...

01:49:39.152 --> 01:49:39.982
...is my coffee.

01:49:42.155 --> 01:49:43.679
What can I do for you?

01:49:47.026 --> 01:49:48.653
Well, Mr. X...

01:49:50.029 --> 01:49:51.656
...my name is Benjamin.

01:49:52.232 --> 01:49:54.223
I was out there tonight.

01:49:54.734 --> 01:49:56.167
Take it easy now.

01:49:56.536 --> 01:49:59.004
And I saw what it is that you did.

01:49:59.205 --> 01:50:01.969
The way you talked
to them policeman and all.

01:50:06.346 --> 01:50:07.836
Well, Mr. X...

01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:12.315
...I want to be a Muslim.

01:50:12.685 --> 01:50:15.415
I ain't never seen a nigger--
I mean...

01:50:15.688 --> 01:50:17.019
...colored person--

01:50:18.925 --> 01:50:20.017
Negro...

01:50:21.027 --> 01:50:23.325
...talk to no police like that before.

01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:26.465
And you want to be Muslim?
Join the Nation Of Islam?

01:50:26.666 --> 01:50:29.567
You know what that means?
To be a Muslim?

01:50:31.671 --> 01:50:32.797
Do you?

01:50:36.376 --> 01:50:39.345
No, not exactly.
But I wanna be one.

01:50:39.712 --> 01:50:40.770
Just like you.

01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.939
You shouldn't join any organization
unless you know what it's about.

01:50:51.624 --> 01:50:52.921
Thank you.

01:50:54.594 --> 01:50:56.926
You shouldn't give up
so easily either.

01:50:58.965 --> 01:51:02.230
We could use more young warriors
like yourself.

01:51:02.469 --> 01:51:04.903
Come on by the temple
next Wednesday, 8:00.

01:51:05.138 --> 01:51:06.332
8:00 sharp.

01:51:06.539 --> 01:51:08.370
Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.

01:51:08.575 --> 01:51:11.874
Thank you, Mr. X. And I won't
make you out a liar either.

01:51:12.078 --> 01:51:13.306
I don't think you will.

01:51:26.493 --> 01:51:27.926
Tonight, I shall...

01:51:28.428 --> 01:51:32.387
...introduce you
as my national minister.

01:51:33.633 --> 01:51:36.101
It will be a difficult task.

01:51:36.503 --> 01:51:38.095
Your assignment...

01:51:38.938 --> 01:51:41.600
...is to build temples
all over this nation.

01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:44.802
More work than you've ever done.

01:51:45.011 --> 01:51:46.069
Yes, sir.

01:51:46.279 --> 01:51:48.304
You will be in the public eye.

01:51:48.515 --> 01:51:51.143
Beware of them cameras.

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:54.851
Them cameras are...

01:51:55.622 --> 01:51:57.852
...bad as any narcotic.

01:52:00.793 --> 01:52:03.489
White devil will be watching
your every step.

01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:06.598
And your own brothers will be...

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.133
...jealous...

01:52:09.802 --> 01:52:11.531
...hostile.

01:52:12.472 --> 01:52:13.769
Go slowly.

01:52:14.073 --> 01:52:15.199
Yes, sir.

01:52:16.543 --> 01:52:17.976
Here's a glass.

01:52:24.784 --> 01:52:26.752
It's dirty water.

01:52:26.953 --> 01:52:28.045
Foul.

01:52:29.856 --> 01:52:32.290
If you offer this to the people...

01:52:32.492 --> 01:52:34.323
...they have no choice.

01:52:34.761 --> 01:52:36.228
They'll drink from it...

01:52:37.196 --> 01:52:38.754
...if they're thirsty.

01:52:39.699 --> 01:52:41.530
But if you offer them...

01:52:42.335 --> 01:52:44.030
...this glass...

01:52:46.839 --> 01:52:50.070
...and let them make
their own decision...

01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:54.175
...they will choose the pure vessel.

01:52:56.182 --> 01:52:57.649
Islam is...

01:52:58.084 --> 01:53:00.348
...the only religion...

01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:04.649
...that addresses
the needs and the problems...

01:53:04.857 --> 01:53:09.089
...of the so-called Negro in America.
Especially in the slums...

01:53:09.295 --> 01:53:10.694
...in the ghettos.

01:53:11.397 --> 01:53:15.493
Islam is the only way out
for drugs and crime...

01:53:15.702 --> 01:53:17.897
...and unemployment, prostitution...

01:53:18.104 --> 01:53:19.731
...alcohol...

01:53:19.939 --> 01:53:21.338
...gambling...

01:53:21.541 --> 01:53:23.805
...and adultery, fornication.

01:53:25.111 --> 01:53:26.203
<i>This sweet...</i>

01:53:26.446 --> 01:53:30.780
<i>...gentle man, at whose feet I kneeled,</i>
<i>gave me the truth from his own mouth.</i>

01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:32.244
Present the pure vessel.

01:53:32.452 --> 01:53:36.786
<i>I adored him in the sense of</i>
<i>the Latin root of the word</i> adorare...

01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:39.049
<i>...which means to worship and to fear.</i>

01:53:39.592 --> 01:53:41.423
<i>He was the first man I ever feared.</i>

01:53:41.628 --> 01:53:44.256
<i>I don't mean fear</i>
<i>such as one has of a gun...</i>

01:53:44.464 --> 01:53:48.264
<i>...but the fear one has</i>
<i>of the power of the sun.</i>

01:53:48.568 --> 01:53:51.867
<i>I pledged myself to him,</i>
<i>even if it cost me my life.</i>

01:53:55.341 --> 01:53:57.104
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello, Betty?

01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:58.638
Yeah, this is Malcolm.

01:53:59.045 --> 01:54:01.707
-I know.
-<i>Right, I'm here in Detroit.</i>

01:54:05.818 --> 01:54:07.945
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

01:54:08.354 --> 01:54:09.787
<i>You heard what I said, right?</i>

01:54:09.989 --> 01:54:12.389
-<i>Did you hear my answer?</i>
-Yes, I think so.

01:54:14.927 --> 01:54:17.589
-<i>Are you eating?</i>
-I've been eating.

01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:18.888
<i>Good.</i>

01:54:19.632 --> 01:54:20.997
<i>I love you, Betty.</i>

01:54:23.603 --> 01:54:25.594
<i>I love you back.</i>

01:54:35.882 --> 01:54:37.281
It's not gonna be easy.

01:54:37.483 --> 01:54:39.007
No choice.

01:54:39.519 --> 01:54:41.111
I'll be away a lot.

01:54:41.954 --> 01:54:43.216
I know.

01:54:46.025 --> 01:54:47.993
In fact, I'm leaving in the morning.

01:54:48.194 --> 01:54:49.684
Hush, now.

01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:52.691
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia...

01:54:54.367 --> 01:54:58.133
...Trenton, Newark, up through number 7
all the way up to Boston.

01:55:04.911 --> 01:55:06.606
You're with me...

01:55:07.914 --> 01:55:09.882
...even when you're away.

01:55:26.399 --> 01:55:28.731
I've never told you this...

01:55:31.337 --> 01:55:34.170
...but the very first time
I ever saw you...

01:55:35.241 --> 01:55:37.334
...standing up on the podium...

01:55:39.946 --> 01:55:42.176
...you were cleaning your glasses...

01:55:44.851 --> 01:55:47.581
...and I felt so sorry for you.

01:55:48.521 --> 01:55:49.852
Sorry for me?

01:55:50.323 --> 01:55:51.187
Why?

01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:56.020
Because no one as young as you
should be so serious.

01:55:58.998 --> 01:56:01.023
But I don't think that anymore.

01:56:01.667 --> 01:56:03.032
What do you think?

01:56:06.038 --> 01:56:08.939
I want to have
a lot of babies with you.

01:56:12.712 --> 01:56:14.202
Dear heart.

01:56:16.783 --> 01:56:18.216
I love you.

01:56:20.453 --> 01:56:23.354
We're waiting on you folks.
Trying to starve us?

01:56:26.793 --> 01:56:28.920
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

01:56:29.128 --> 01:56:33.656
...we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and fruitful marriage.

01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:39.001
Congratulations, Brother Minister.

01:56:41.307 --> 01:56:43.571
Check them out. Front page!

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:52.949
I must emphasize at the start that
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

01:56:53.586 --> 01:56:58.421
So I'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican nor as a Democrat.

01:56:59.992 --> 01:57:02.654
Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.

01:57:03.996 --> 01:57:06.726
Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.

01:57:06.933 --> 01:57:09.629
Not as a Christian nor a Jew.

01:57:09.836 --> 01:57:12.168
Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.

01:57:12.371 --> 01:57:14.771
In fact, not even as an American.

01:57:15.508 --> 01:57:17.601
Because if I was an American...

01:57:17.844 --> 01:57:21.473
...the problem that confronts our people
today wouldn't even exist.

01:57:24.884 --> 01:57:28.320
So I have to stand here today
as what I was when I was born...

01:57:28.621 --> 01:57:30.179
...a black man.

01:57:34.794 --> 01:57:39.493
Before there was any such thing as a
Republican or a Democrat, we were black.

01:57:39.699 --> 01:57:43.499
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

01:57:43.703 --> 01:57:47.935
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:52.509
In fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

01:57:52.778 --> 01:57:56.270
And after America has long passed
from the scene...

01:57:56.482 --> 01:57:58.950
...there will still be black people.

01:57:59.986 --> 01:58:02.648
I'm gonna tell you like it really is!

01:58:03.389 --> 01:58:08.190
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us.

01:58:08.394 --> 01:58:11.192
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man.

01:58:11.397 --> 01:58:12.694
This is what they do.

01:58:12.899 --> 01:58:15.800
They send drugs in Harlem down here
to pacify us!

01:58:16.002 --> 01:58:18.698
They send alcohol down here
to pacify us!

01:58:18.905 --> 01:58:21.874
They send prostitution down here
to pacify us!

01:58:22.074 --> 01:58:25.475
You can't get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

01:58:25.678 --> 01:58:28.977
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

01:58:29.181 --> 01:58:32.344
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

01:58:32.551 --> 01:58:35.384
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

01:58:35.588 --> 01:58:38.148
...that's a government seal
you're breaking.

01:58:38.357 --> 01:58:42.225
I say, and I say it again,
you been had.

01:58:42.428 --> 01:58:43.952
You been took.

01:58:44.163 --> 01:58:45.755
You been hoodwinked.

01:58:46.098 --> 01:58:48.692
Bamboozled. Led astray.

01:58:48.935 --> 01:58:51.426
Run amuck. This is what he does.

01:58:51.704 --> 01:58:54.400
You know, some people
call this hate-teaching.

01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:56.708
This isn't hate-teaching.

01:58:56.909 --> 01:58:58.536
This is love-teaching.

01:58:59.145 --> 01:59:01.670
I wouldn't tell you this
if I didn't love you.

01:59:01.881 --> 01:59:04.679
I wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if I didn't love you.

01:59:04.884 --> 01:59:07.751
I want you to understand one thing:
Everything I teach you...

01:59:07.954 --> 01:59:10.013
...everything I have said to you...

01:59:10.222 --> 01:59:13.214
...has been taught to me
by this dear man.

01:59:13.459 --> 01:59:14.721
This divine man.

01:59:16.295 --> 01:59:19.787
All praise is due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

01:59:20.466 --> 01:59:22.297
<i>Attallah's fine.</i>

01:59:22.501 --> 01:59:25.061
<i>And she misses you as much as I do.</i>

01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:29.703
<i>But the news that you've dedicated</i>
<i>four new temples is almost as good...</i>

01:59:29.909 --> 01:59:33.276
<i>...as having you with us.</i>
<i>Oh, dear heart.</i>

01:59:33.479 --> 01:59:38.280
--<i>white supremacy, try to hide their</i>
<i>guilt by accusing Elijah Muhammad...</i>

01:59:38.484 --> 01:59:40.111
<i>...of being a black supremacist...</i>

01:59:40.319 --> 01:59:43.117
<i>...simply because he's trying</i>
<i>to uplift the mentality...</i>

01:59:43.322 --> 01:59:46.155
<i>...the social and economic condition</i>
<i>of his people.</i>

01:59:46.359 --> 01:59:50.455
<i>And the Jews who have been guilty</i>
<i>of exploiting black people...</i>

01:59:50.663 --> 01:59:53.928
<i>...try to hide their guilt</i>
<i>by accusing Elijah Muhammad...</i>

01:59:54.166 --> 01:59:56.225
<i>...of being anti-Semitic...</i>

01:59:56.435 --> 01:59:59.836
...simply because he's trying
to teach you and l--

02:00:00.039 --> 02:00:02.030
<i>He's trying to teach you and I...</i>

02:00:02.241 --> 02:00:05.404
<i>...to be in charge of the businesses</i>
<i>in our own community.</i>

02:00:05.611 --> 02:00:08.307
<i>To own the businesses</i>
<i>in our own community.</i>

02:00:08.514 --> 02:00:11.176
<i>To have economic leadership</i>
<i>in our own community.</i>

02:00:12.084 --> 02:00:13.984
<i>No, this isn't black supremacy...</i>

02:00:14.186 --> 02:00:16.552
<i>...this is black intelligence.</i>

02:00:33.439 --> 02:00:35.737
<i>The black people in this country...</i>

02:00:36.142 --> 02:00:38.542
<i>...have been the victims</i>
<i>of violence...</i>

02:00:39.045 --> 02:00:41.639
<i>...at the hands</i>
<i>of the American right wing...</i>

02:00:41.847 --> 02:00:44.975
<i>...for 400 years.</i>

02:00:45.384 --> 02:00:47.477
<i>Four hundred years.</i>

02:00:48.054 --> 02:00:49.817
<i>Four hundred years.</i>

02:00:52.124 --> 02:00:55.218
<i>We thought by following</i>
<i>those ignorant Negro preachers...</i>

02:00:55.428 --> 02:00:57.896
<i>...that it was God-like</i>
<i>to turn the other cheek...</i>

02:00:58.097 --> 02:01:00.588
<i>...to the group</i>
<i>that was brutalizing us.</i>

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.697
A hundred years ago,
they used to put on white sheets...

02:01:04.904 --> 02:01:07.031
...and sic bloodhounds on us.

02:01:07.239 --> 02:01:09.639
Nowadays, they've traded in
the sheets--

02:01:09.842 --> 02:01:11.571
Some have traded in the sheets--

02:01:12.912 --> 02:01:14.971
<i>They've traded in the sheets</i>--

02:01:15.181 --> 02:01:16.546
<i>Please, please.</i>

02:01:16.749 --> 02:01:20.082
<i>They've traded in those white sheets</i>
<i>for police uniforms.</i>

02:01:20.419 --> 02:01:23.513
<i>They traded in the bloodhounds</i>
<i>for police dogs.</i>

02:01:23.722 --> 02:01:26.384
<i>And just like Uncle Tom</i>
<i>back during slavery time....</i>

02:01:26.592 --> 02:01:31.086
<i>We must remain true to nonviolence.</i>
<i>I'm asking everybody in the line.</i>

02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:34.024
<i>If you can't be nonviolent,</i>
<i>don't get in it.</i>

02:01:34.233 --> 02:01:37.225
--To love our enemy and pray
for those who use us spitefully.

02:01:37.436 --> 02:01:41.600
You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,
so-called Negro leaders today.

02:01:41.807 --> 02:01:43.900
<i>And it's another great day.</i>

02:01:44.110 --> 02:01:47.876
<i>You've got these Uncle Tom</i>
<i>Negro leaders today...</i>

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.674
<i>...that tell us we ought to pray</i>
<i>for our enemies.</i>

02:01:50.883 --> 02:01:53.943
<i>We ought to love our enemy</i>
<i>and integrate with the enemy...</i>

02:01:54.153 --> 02:01:57.748
<i>...who bombs us, who kills</i>
<i>and shoots us, who lynches us...</i>

02:01:57.957 --> 02:02:00.858
<i>...who rapes our women</i>
<i>and children. No!</i>

02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:05.288
<i>No! That's not intelligent.</i>

02:02:05.564 --> 02:02:07.361
<i>That's not intelligent.</i>

02:02:07.566 --> 02:02:10.262
Elijah Muhammad is trying
to teach you and I...

02:02:10.469 --> 02:02:13.802
...that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

02:02:14.006 --> 02:02:17.442
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

02:02:17.643 --> 02:02:20.578
...the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

02:02:20.813 --> 02:02:22.542
...to protect himself...

02:02:22.748 --> 02:02:26.309
...just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

02:02:26.585 --> 02:02:29.315
...we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

02:02:29.889 --> 02:02:34.258
This is only natural. This is what
Elijah Muhammad is trying to teach.

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:36.451
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

02:02:36.662 --> 02:02:39.153
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

02:02:40.332 --> 02:02:44.359
<i>Mr. X, before we begin</i>
<i>our discussion tonight...</i>

02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:47.903
<i>... "The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...</i>

02:02:48.607 --> 02:02:52.168
<i>...would you mind explaining for us</i>
<i>the meaning of your name...</i>

02:02:52.378 --> 02:02:54.812
<i>...which is the letter "X"?</i>

02:02:55.447 --> 02:02:58.314
During slavery time,
the slave master...

02:02:58.517 --> 02:03:01.042
...gave the Negro--
the so-called Negro...

02:03:01.253 --> 02:03:04.416
...named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

02:03:05.524 --> 02:03:07.253
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

02:03:07.459 --> 02:03:11.156
...that once we come into the knowledge
of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...

02:03:11.363 --> 02:03:13.991
...we replace our slave name
with an "X" ...

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.101
..."X" in mathematics representing
the unknown.

02:03:17.369 --> 02:03:20.463
Since we've been disconnected,
or cut off from our own history...

02:03:20.673 --> 02:03:23.642
...our own past, our own culture,
our own land...

02:03:23.842 --> 02:03:27.573
...we use the "X," the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.045
I see. Thank you. Dr. Payson?

02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:33.912
Mr. X is a....
He's a demagogue.

02:03:34.119 --> 02:03:36.883
He has no place to go,
so he exaggerates.

02:03:37.122 --> 02:03:38.350
He's a disservice to...

02:03:38.557 --> 02:03:42.391
...every good, law-abiding, church-going
American Negro in the country.

02:03:46.465 --> 02:03:49.593
Why do you teach black supremacy?

02:03:49.802 --> 02:03:51.736
Why do you teach hate?

02:03:51.937 --> 02:03:54.405
Well, for the white man...

02:03:54.607 --> 02:03:57.075
...to ask the black man...

02:03:57.576 --> 02:03:59.009
...why he hates him...

02:03:59.245 --> 02:04:03.147
...is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

02:04:03.349 --> 02:04:04.373
..."Do you hate me?"

02:04:04.583 --> 02:04:08.212
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:10.388
<i>This is a black man</i>
<i>asking the question.</i>

02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:14.753
<i>What would you call an educated Negro</i>
<i>with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. Or a Ph.D.?</i>

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.418
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

02:04:18.631 --> 02:04:20.826
You have to understand this thinking.

02:04:21.033 --> 02:04:24.662
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:28.533
...there were two types of slaves:
The house Negro and the field Negro.

02:04:28.741 --> 02:04:30.538
The house Negro lived in the house...

02:04:30.743 --> 02:04:34.406
...next to his master. In the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

02:04:34.647 --> 02:04:37.377
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

02:04:37.583 --> 02:04:39.210
He loved his master.

02:04:39.418 --> 02:04:42.615
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

02:04:42.821 --> 02:04:47.121
If master said, "We got a nice house,"
you say, "Yeah, we got a nice house."

02:04:47.493 --> 02:04:49.859
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

02:04:50.329 --> 02:04:51.591
...would put the blaze out.

02:04:51.797 --> 02:04:55.130
If the master got sick, he'd say,
"What's the matter? We sick?"

02:04:55.534 --> 02:04:58.196
"We sick" ! This is the thinking
of the house Negro.

02:04:58.404 --> 02:05:00.133
If another slave said...

02:05:00.339 --> 02:05:03.206
..."Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master" ...

02:05:03.409 --> 02:05:06.344
...he said, "Why? What's better
than what we got here?

02:05:06.545 --> 02:05:08.979
I'm not going anywhere."
This is the house Negro.

02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:11.012
In those days, we called them
house niggers.

02:05:11.216 --> 02:05:15.277
That's what we call them today because
we still got a lot of house niggers.

02:05:16.221 --> 02:05:17.381
Dear Holy Apostle...

02:05:19.224 --> 02:05:22.489
...the ministers think Malcolm is
getting too much press.

02:05:23.796 --> 02:05:26.424
They think he thinks he is
the Nation of Islam.

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.962
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

02:05:32.037 --> 02:05:34.938
It was you who made Malcolm
the man he is.

02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.630
You lifted him out of darkness.

02:05:40.245 --> 02:05:42.873
You go and tell the brothers...

02:05:43.615 --> 02:05:45.344
...that what the Brother Minister...

02:05:45.718 --> 02:05:47.583
...is doing, has done...

02:05:47.886 --> 02:05:52.289
...has been of great benefit
to the Nation.

02:05:52.491 --> 02:05:54.482
And you tell them that I say so.

02:05:54.693 --> 02:05:57.321
The ministers think he is
of great benefit to himself.

02:06:07.106 --> 02:06:07.970
One at a time.

02:06:08.173 --> 02:06:11.233
-<i>Did you say white people are devils?</i>
-<i>I said they're devils.</i>

02:06:11.443 --> 02:06:13.206
<i>Should all black men be armed?</i>

02:06:13.412 --> 02:06:15.778
Well, one of your most
famous men said:

02:06:15.981 --> 02:06:19.508
"Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition." That's the way you think.

02:06:19.718 --> 02:06:22.050
<i>Do you think your cause</i>
<i>will be successful?</i>

02:06:22.254 --> 02:06:23.585
<i>I sincerely hope so.</i>

02:06:23.789 --> 02:06:26.087
-Do you advocate violence?
-No, sir.

02:06:26.291 --> 02:06:28.486
Has a white man helped your people?

02:06:28.694 --> 02:06:31.254
<i>Has there been a white man</i>
<i>that's helped my people?</i>

02:06:31.463 --> 02:06:33.658
-<i>Correct.</i>
-<i>I don't understand the question.</i>

02:06:33.866 --> 02:06:36.027
<i>You preach anti-white,</i>
<i>anti-Christian science.</i>

02:06:36.235 --> 02:06:38.135
You're saying you're anti-white?

02:06:38.337 --> 02:06:41.306
-No, you're saying it.
-Are all white people devils?

02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:45.398
<i>We've gotta move out.</i>
<i>We've got a plane to catch.</i>

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:50.312
Excuse me, Mr. X?

02:06:51.016 --> 02:06:52.916
I've read some of your speeches...

02:06:53.118 --> 02:06:56.849
...and I honestly believe that a lot
of what you have to say is true.

02:06:57.055 --> 02:07:00.115
I'm a good person in spite
of what my ancestors did.

02:07:00.325 --> 02:07:02.384
I just wanted to ask you...

02:07:02.594 --> 02:07:05.461
...what can a white person
like me, who isn't prejudiced...

02:07:05.664 --> 02:07:09.225
...what can I do to help you
and further your cause?

02:07:09.435 --> 02:07:10.527
Nothing.

02:07:18.076 --> 02:07:20.476
<i>My high school was a black ghetto...</i>

02:07:20.679 --> 02:07:22.840
<i>...in Roxbury, right here in Boston.</i>

02:07:23.682 --> 02:07:27.277
<i>I got my college education on</i>
<i>the streets of Harlem in New York City.</i>

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.645
I took my master's degree in prison...

02:07:31.089 --> 02:07:32.647
...over six and a half years.

02:07:32.858 --> 02:07:34.086
In fact...

02:07:34.293 --> 02:07:37.956
...my old burglary hangout
was just outside this campus.

02:07:38.730 --> 02:07:40.197
I lived like an animal.

02:07:41.133 --> 02:07:42.532
I stole.

02:07:42.868 --> 02:07:44.665
I used drugs.

02:07:45.671 --> 02:07:48.697
I smoked reefers, cocaine.

02:07:48.907 --> 02:07:52.707
I committed adultery. Had it not been
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

02:07:53.479 --> 02:07:56.312
...l'd have surely been in
an insane asylum or dead...

02:07:56.515 --> 02:07:59.245
...or possibly even a murderer
of one of you.

02:07:59.451 --> 02:08:03.683
So what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

02:08:03.922 --> 02:08:07.585
...so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

02:08:07.793 --> 02:08:10.626
When the so-called Negro in America
gets on God's side...

02:08:10.829 --> 02:08:13.423
...and listens to the teachings
of Elijah Muhammad...

02:08:13.632 --> 02:08:17.068
...he'll want to get off of drugs
and get away from a life of crime.

02:08:17.269 --> 02:08:19.931
He'll want to get away
from committing adultery.

02:08:20.138 --> 02:08:23.039
Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

02:08:23.242 --> 02:08:26.803
...to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

02:08:27.012 --> 02:08:29.480
His son will say,
"I'm proud that that's my father."

02:08:29.681 --> 02:08:32.411
His wife will say,
"I'm proud that that's my husband."

02:08:32.618 --> 02:08:37.248
"Father" only means that you take care
of your children. That's what it is.

02:08:37.456 --> 02:08:40.448
"Father" doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

02:08:40.659 --> 02:08:42.217
That doesn't make you a father.

02:08:42.427 --> 02:08:44.190
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

02:08:44.396 --> 02:08:47.365
But not anybody can take care
of that woman.

02:08:47.566 --> 02:08:50.296
There's another word for it.
It's called responsibility.

02:08:50.869 --> 02:08:55.329
If the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

02:08:55.541 --> 02:08:57.509
...we wouldn't have a racial problem.

02:08:57.709 --> 02:09:00.769
If the Emancipation Proclamation
was authentic...

02:09:01.313 --> 02:09:03.611
...if the 13th, 14th and 15th
amendments...

02:09:03.815 --> 02:09:06.545
...were authentic,
we wouldn't have a race problem.

02:09:06.785 --> 02:09:09.754
If the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

02:09:09.955 --> 02:09:11.445
...we wouldn't have a race problem.

02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:15.182
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

02:09:15.394 --> 02:09:18.124
These Negro leaders are telling
the white man...

02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:21.163
...that everything's all right,
we got it under control.

02:09:21.366 --> 02:09:24.028
That everything Elijah Muhammad
teaches is wrong.

02:09:24.236 --> 02:09:27.728
Mr. Muhammad said these things
were gonna come to pass...

02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.805
...and now they're coming to pass.

02:09:32.611 --> 02:09:35.307
Now these same Negro leaders...

02:09:36.448 --> 02:09:41.078
...are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion.

02:09:42.988 --> 02:09:45.582
Yes, there's gonna be
a racial explosion.

02:09:46.058 --> 02:09:50.586
And a racial explosion is
more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

02:09:52.264 --> 02:09:56.394
There's going to be an explosion because
black people are dissatisfied...

02:09:56.602 --> 02:10:00.800
...not only with the white man, but with
these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

02:10:01.006 --> 02:10:02.871
...that try to pose
as spokesmen...

02:10:03.075 --> 02:10:04.542
...for you and I.

02:10:04.977 --> 02:10:06.171
Just like you have a--

02:10:06.979 --> 02:10:08.708
Just like you have a powder keg.

02:10:09.047 --> 02:10:11.607
When you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks...

02:10:11.817 --> 02:10:13.444
...the thing's going to explode.

02:10:13.652 --> 02:10:17.418
If the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

02:10:17.623 --> 02:10:20.615
...and if it explodes, then the house
is going to be destroyed.

02:10:20.826 --> 02:10:23.659
I said the house is going
to be destroyed.

02:10:23.862 --> 02:10:26.422
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
teaching you and I...

02:10:26.632 --> 02:10:30.591
...and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house.

02:10:30.936 --> 02:10:33.268
Let the black man separate
from his house.

02:10:33.505 --> 02:10:35.473
Let the black man have his own house.

02:10:35.674 --> 02:10:38.438
Let the black man have
his own land and property.

02:10:41.346 --> 02:10:44.338
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
trying to tell the white man...

02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:48.485
...that this thing, this explosion, is
gonna bring down his house.

02:10:48.687 --> 02:10:52.145
This is what he's telling him.
More importantly, he's telling him...

02:10:52.357 --> 02:10:54.348
...that if he doesn't do
something about it...

02:10:54.559 --> 02:10:59.496
...if he doesn't do something about it,
it's gonna explode any day now.

02:10:59.831 --> 02:11:03.096
I'm just here to tell you,
and I'm gonna make it very short.

02:11:03.635 --> 02:11:07.571
I'm here to tell you about
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

02:11:07.906 --> 02:11:11.137
His greatest greatness is
that he has the only solution...

02:11:11.343 --> 02:11:13.402
...for peace in this country.

02:11:13.845 --> 02:11:16.336
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's
solution...

02:11:16.548 --> 02:11:18.675
...is the only solution for you and I.

02:11:18.884 --> 02:11:21.512
It's the only solution
for the white man.

02:11:22.754 --> 02:11:25.188
Complete separation...

02:11:25.524 --> 02:11:29.016
...between the black race
and the white race.

02:11:31.630 --> 02:11:33.495
It's the only solution.

02:11:39.871 --> 02:11:42.101
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

02:11:42.307 --> 02:11:44.639
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

02:12:20.479 --> 02:12:22.242
Brother Malcolm!

02:12:23.081 --> 02:12:25.811
Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.

02:12:26.651 --> 02:12:29.950
Yes, sir. It's all right.
My brother. How you doing?

02:12:30.155 --> 02:12:32.214
-Can I ask you something?
-Anything.

02:12:32.424 --> 02:12:34.221
Are you Elijah's pimp?

02:12:34.426 --> 02:12:37.088
He should be killed
for talking like that!

02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:39.922
What are you saying, brother?

02:12:40.432 --> 02:12:42.059
"His greatest greatness."

02:12:42.267 --> 02:12:44.030
Just say what you're saying.

02:12:45.837 --> 02:12:47.532
If you don't know...

02:12:47.873 --> 02:12:49.272
...I feel the sorriest for you.

02:12:49.474 --> 02:12:51.499
Oh, come on, brother.

02:12:52.677 --> 02:12:54.440
Let me tell you something.

02:13:03.555 --> 02:13:04.852
It's all right.

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:11.485
He's just hungry for knowledge,
that's all.

02:13:11.696 --> 02:13:13.857
Yeah, that brother's starving.

02:13:14.199 --> 02:13:16.861
So am I. Come on,
let's get something to eat.

02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:20.097
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

02:13:20.305 --> 02:13:22.830
-Okay, night-night, Daddy.
-Night-night.

02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:39.584
Long night.

02:13:46.798 --> 02:13:48.595
-What you looking at?
-You.

02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:50.267
Why you looking like that?

02:13:50.468 --> 02:13:51.730
You're in trouble.

02:13:53.972 --> 02:13:54.961
How do you know?

02:13:55.173 --> 02:13:57.232
Oh, dear heart.

02:13:57.876 --> 02:13:59.173
Because I know you.

02:13:59.377 --> 02:14:01.072
Well, if you know me...

02:14:02.914 --> 02:14:05.781
...you know I don't like to bring
my troubles home.

02:14:07.419 --> 02:14:08.909
You know that also.

02:14:11.756 --> 02:14:12.916
Yes, I do.

02:14:15.393 --> 02:14:17.452
But I'm not made of glass.

02:14:17.662 --> 02:14:19.653
And I won't break.

02:14:27.138 --> 02:14:29.368
Look, Betty, I just want peace.

02:14:30.909 --> 02:14:33.173
I want to sit here with you.
I want to...

02:14:34.479 --> 02:14:37.539
...be still. I want peace in my house.

02:14:41.219 --> 02:14:43.949
-Have we ever had a fight?
-Never.

02:14:44.155 --> 02:14:46.521
-Argument?
-Never had one, no.

02:14:49.361 --> 02:14:51.022
We're gonna have one...

02:14:52.330 --> 02:14:55.026
-...if you don't talk about it.
-Talk about what?

02:14:55.233 --> 02:14:59.431
-The talk's everywhere.
-There's always gonna be talk.

02:14:59.638 --> 02:15:02.971
Aren't they talking now about me trying
to take over the Nation?

02:15:03.241 --> 02:15:06.301
Aren't they talking about
how we're getting rich...

02:15:06.511 --> 02:15:08.342
...off the Nation of Islam?

02:15:08.546 --> 02:15:11.310
-We could talk about that too.
-Let's talk about it.

02:15:11.716 --> 02:15:13.513
It's not just talk anymore.

02:15:13.718 --> 02:15:17.119
"UPl: Elijah Muhammad, 67...

02:15:17.322 --> 02:15:20.086
...leader of
the Black Muslim movement...

02:15:20.292 --> 02:15:24.626
...today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries."

02:15:24.829 --> 02:15:28.230
These are slanders. These are lies.
Don't you know that?

02:15:28.433 --> 02:15:32.494
Don't you realize this is
the devil's newspaper?

02:15:32.837 --> 02:15:34.896
He's trying to divide us.

02:15:35.407 --> 02:15:39.571
Divide and conquer. He's trying
to bring down our leader.

02:15:43.014 --> 02:15:44.345
"Both women...

02:15:45.183 --> 02:15:48.812
...in their 20s, charge that
they had intimacy--"

02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:51.887
"Intimacies with Mr. Muhammad--"

02:16:00.165 --> 02:16:04.158
You think I'm not
aware of these accusations?

02:16:04.369 --> 02:16:07.702
You think I'm not
aware of these vicious lies?

02:16:09.808 --> 02:16:13.039
-Brother Baines and I discussed it today.
-Baines?

02:16:13.645 --> 02:16:14.839
Is he your friend?

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:15.910
What's wrong?

02:16:16.114 --> 02:16:18.582
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

02:16:18.783 --> 02:16:22.344
Wake up! Are you so committed that
you've blinded yourself?

02:16:22.554 --> 02:16:25.352
You're so dedicated,
you can't face the truth?

02:16:25.557 --> 02:16:26.819
Baines?

02:16:27.058 --> 02:16:30.494
He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

02:16:30.729 --> 02:16:35.029
Ask him why your name hasn't
appeared in it for over a year.

02:16:35.233 --> 02:16:38.861
-I'm not interested in publicity.
-You're in every other paper.

02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:42.300
Our people know what I'm doing.

02:16:42.507 --> 02:16:45.532
-But do you know what Baines is doing?
-Baines! Baines!

02:16:45.744 --> 02:16:49.736
You're so blind!
Everyone can see but you!

02:16:51.415 --> 02:16:54.852
Baines is the one who saved my life.

02:16:55.053 --> 02:16:57.351
When I crawled in prison
like an animal...

02:16:57.555 --> 02:17:00.183
...he brought me to
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

02:17:00.392 --> 02:17:02.986
And Mr. Muhammad brought me
back from the dead--

02:17:03.193 --> 02:17:05.218
A long time ago!
You've repaid them!

02:17:05.430 --> 02:17:08.126
Don't you raise your voice
in my house!

02:17:12.603 --> 02:17:14.093
Ask them.

02:17:15.607 --> 02:17:18.405
Ask them why they have new cars,
houses and furniture.

02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:21.170
Is that what this is about?
You want furniture?

02:17:21.379 --> 02:17:23.677
-You want cars?
-What do we have?

02:17:23.882 --> 02:17:25.873
What do we have, Malcolm?

02:17:26.217 --> 02:17:28.208
Broken-down jalopy....

02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:31.254
The clothes on our backs.

02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:33.317
So I'll get you new clothes....

02:17:33.525 --> 02:17:36.016
We don't even own our own home.

02:17:36.227 --> 02:17:39.162
What about our children?
What about me?

02:17:39.531 --> 02:17:41.522
We don't even own life insurance.

02:17:41.733 --> 02:17:45.100
The Nation will support all of you
if anything happens to me--

02:17:45.303 --> 02:17:46.291
Will they?

02:17:47.472 --> 02:17:48.734
Are you sure?

02:17:50.308 --> 02:17:51.638
Are you sure?

02:17:52.644 --> 02:17:53.975
Are you sure?

02:17:55.647 --> 02:17:57.308
Or are you blind?

02:18:00.818 --> 02:18:01.808
All right.

02:18:07.759 --> 02:18:09.659
I've got work to do, so....

02:18:11.329 --> 02:18:13.320
There's always work to do.

02:18:13.598 --> 02:18:15.395
-Help me.
-I'm trying to.

02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.127
I'm raising the children
practically by myself.

02:18:19.337 --> 02:18:21.965
What do you want me to do?
Stay home?

02:18:22.173 --> 02:18:25.609
You don't know how often they ask,
"Where's Daddy?"

02:18:25.809 --> 02:18:28.472
You want me to make the beds
and go on the road?

02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:30.409
-The people need me!
-We need you!

02:18:30.615 --> 02:18:33.311
I need you too.
But what do you want me to do?

02:18:33.518 --> 02:18:35.611
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

02:18:36.487 --> 02:18:40.822
You can face death 24 hours a day,
but the possibility of betrayal...

02:18:41.058 --> 02:18:43.186
...never enters your head.

02:18:46.464 --> 02:18:48.364
Open your eyes.

02:19:24.936 --> 02:19:27.837
-As-Salaam-Alaikum, minister
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

02:19:28.039 --> 02:19:30.007
Her name's Eva Marie.

02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:32.601
And she's 2 years old.

02:19:34.179 --> 02:19:36.942
Brother Minister,
I didn't do anything wrong.

02:19:37.182 --> 02:19:40.276
I didn't do anything to be
put in isolation.

02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:43.282
I believed in him.

02:19:44.689 --> 02:19:48.125
I believed in
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

02:19:49.794 --> 02:19:51.352
Believe in Allah.

02:19:55.967 --> 02:19:58.197
This is Saudi.
She's 2.

02:19:58.536 --> 02:20:00.504
And you have Lisha.
She's 3.

02:20:00.705 --> 02:20:05.438
<i>From their own mouths I heard</i>
<i>who had fathered their children.</i>

02:20:05.977 --> 02:20:08.878
<i>And from their own mouths</i>
<i>I heard that Mr. Muhammad...</i>

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.207
<i>...had told them I was the best.</i>

02:20:11.983 --> 02:20:14.543
He often spoke of you.
He loves you like a son.

02:20:14.819 --> 02:20:17.947
<i>The greatest minister he had,</i>
<i>but that I would leave him...</i>

02:20:18.156 --> 02:20:21.421
<i>...turn against him.</i>
<i>And so I was dangerous.</i>

02:20:21.626 --> 02:20:25.392
<i>Mr. Muhammad, while praising me</i>
<i>to my face...</i>

02:20:26.130 --> 02:20:28.394
<i>...was tearing me apart</i>
<i>behind by back.</i>

02:20:28.666 --> 02:20:30.964
-You're sure about all this?
-Yes, I am.

02:20:31.202 --> 02:20:33.898
All I want is support for
my three children...

02:20:34.339 --> 02:20:37.399
...that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them.

02:20:37.742 --> 02:20:39.471
That's all I want.

02:20:41.946 --> 02:20:43.971
Allah will provide...

02:20:47.652 --> 02:20:48.676
...for all of us.

02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.854
What do you mean, blackout?

02:20:51.055 --> 02:20:53.421
Perhaps some brothers are
a little jealous.

02:20:54.192 --> 02:20:57.389
Maybe they think you've been
getting too much press.

02:20:57.595 --> 02:20:59.222
It's nothing. Forget it.

02:20:59.430 --> 02:21:01.990
Now about our coming
up in the world a little.

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:05.192
The Nation's grown.
We've grown with it.

02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:07.694
You know our people.

02:21:09.207 --> 02:21:11.505
They want their leaders
to be prosperous.

02:21:12.610 --> 02:21:14.407
One hand washes the other.

02:21:15.013 --> 02:21:18.210
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

02:21:20.685 --> 02:21:22.744
Remember what you told me in prison?

02:21:22.954 --> 02:21:26.788
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

02:21:28.726 --> 02:21:29.954
Brother Malcolm...

02:21:32.997 --> 02:21:35.363
...what do you want?
A new car?

02:21:35.967 --> 02:21:37.400
A new house?

02:21:38.936 --> 02:21:40.563
It's the money, isn't it?

02:21:45.643 --> 02:21:49.545
But we tell the whole world that
we're moral leaders...

02:21:49.881 --> 02:21:51.644
...because we follow...

02:21:52.317 --> 02:21:54.911
...the personal example of
Mr. Muhammad.

02:21:55.119 --> 02:21:57.246
Elijah Muhammad is a human being...

02:21:58.156 --> 02:21:59.418
...and so are you.

02:22:00.358 --> 02:22:02.121
-Do you know your Bible?
-Do you?

02:22:02.493 --> 02:22:04.427
David slept with Bathsheba...

02:22:04.629 --> 02:22:06.995
...but he's remembered for
slaying Goliath.

02:22:08.666 --> 02:22:12.659
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

02:22:13.971 --> 02:22:18.635
Solomon had 700 wives, but he
was history's greatest, wisest king.

02:22:18.843 --> 02:22:22.574
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:25.715
A great man's deeds
outweigh his personal weaknesses.

02:22:25.917 --> 02:22:28.249
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

02:22:28.453 --> 02:22:30.978
-I'm not gonna allow--
-Be careful, Malcolm.

02:22:32.957 --> 02:22:34.356
I warn you.

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:36.588
You be careful.

02:23:05.957 --> 02:23:08.016
I'm not surprised.

02:23:11.195 --> 02:23:16.098
You have a very good understanding of
prophecy, of spiritual matters.

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.359
I'm not surprised.

02:23:18.970 --> 02:23:21.666
I have built this Nation...

02:23:21.873 --> 02:23:25.172
...under the divine guidance of Allah.

02:23:25.977 --> 02:23:29.913
He has brought me back
from the dead to lead my people.

02:23:30.114 --> 02:23:32.514
After me,
there will be no more.

02:23:32.717 --> 02:23:34.480
No more.

02:23:38.489 --> 02:23:40.320
I must...

02:23:42.326 --> 02:23:45.591
...plant my seed in fertile soil.

02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:47.263
It is only...

02:23:47.932 --> 02:23:50.924
...the fulfillment of prophecy.

02:23:51.335 --> 02:23:55.169
<i>My faith had been shattered</i>
<i>in a way I can never fully describe.</i>

02:23:55.406 --> 02:23:58.170
<i>Every second of my 12 years</i>
<i>with Mr. Muhammad...</i>

02:23:58.376 --> 02:24:00.867
<i>...I'd been ready to die for him.</i>

02:24:01.078 --> 02:24:04.707
<i>The thing to me that is worse than</i>
<i>death itself is betrayal.</i>

02:24:04.916 --> 02:24:08.818
<i>I could conceive death,</i>
<i>but I couldn't conceive betrayal.</i>

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:13.423
<i>Not of the loyalty I gave to</i>
<i>the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.</i>

02:24:13.691 --> 02:24:16.990
<i>During that time, if Mr. Muhammad</i>
<i>had committed any crime...</i>

02:24:17.195 --> 02:24:21.063
<i>...punishable by death, I would</i>
<i>have tried to prove I did it...</i>

02:24:21.265 --> 02:24:22.562
<i>...to save him.</i>

02:24:22.767 --> 02:24:26.168
<i>I would have gladly gone</i>
<i>to the electric chair in his place.</i>

02:24:42.553 --> 02:24:44.111
What did he say?

02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:54.728
-I'm so sorry.
-There's nothing to be sorry about.

02:24:55.399 --> 02:24:58.061
I just got a lot of work to do,
that's all.

02:25:02.173 --> 02:25:03.538
How can you work?

02:25:03.741 --> 02:25:05.971
Because we have to teach.

02:25:06.477 --> 02:25:10.140
We gotta teach the people.
We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses...

02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:13.416
...David.
Solomon had 700 wives.

02:25:13.618 --> 02:25:17.019
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his....

02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:20.414
My father used to say that...

02:25:21.158 --> 02:25:23.888
...you can't make a rooster stop
crowing after sunrise.

02:25:24.095 --> 02:25:25.756
Well, the sun is up.

02:25:48.753 --> 02:25:53.486
So what do I say about this
so-called national day of mourning?

02:25:53.858 --> 02:25:57.350
I say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

02:25:57.562 --> 02:25:59.496
...by our beliefs and by his own.

02:25:59.697 --> 02:26:02.495
The IKoran teaches us that
those who work evil...

02:26:02.967 --> 02:26:07.427
...will be condemned, punished
or judged according to their works.

02:26:07.638 --> 02:26:10.835
<i>The Holy Bible teaches us that</i>
<i>you reap what you sow.</i>

02:26:11.042 --> 02:26:12.509
<i>This is divine justice.</i>

02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:16.544
In the Americas' soil, the white man
has planted seeds of hatred...

02:26:16.747 --> 02:26:18.647
...the seeds of violence.

02:26:18.849 --> 02:26:21.443
He's allowed those weeds to choke...

02:26:21.652 --> 02:26:25.213
...the lives of millions of black men
and women for 400 years...

02:26:25.423 --> 02:26:28.722
...and the lives of Indians in these
Americas for 500 years.

02:26:28.926 --> 02:26:31.019
And now those same weeds...

02:26:31.228 --> 02:26:34.163
...have choked his own chief gardener.

02:26:34.365 --> 02:26:37.596
You ask me what I say.
I only say what the Bible says.

02:26:37.868 --> 02:26:40.132
I say what the IKoran says.

02:26:40.871 --> 02:26:42.566
I say it's justice.

02:26:47.411 --> 02:26:52.348
Don't you even feel a bit remorseful
or saddened by IKennedy's assassination?

02:26:52.883 --> 02:26:56.182
I don't think anyone would deny that
when you send chickens...

02:26:56.387 --> 02:26:58.184
<i>...out from the barnyard...</i>

02:26:58.389 --> 02:27:01.916
<i>...those chickens will return to</i>
<i>your barnyard, not your neighbor's.</i>

02:27:02.126 --> 02:27:05.459
It's an example of the devil's
chickens coming home to roost.

02:27:05.663 --> 02:27:08.689
The violence that he's
perpetrated here and abroad...

02:27:08.899 --> 02:27:12.835
...four children in Birmingham,
or Medgar Evers, or in Africa...

02:27:13.037 --> 02:27:15.528
...this same violence has claimed
one of their own.

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:19.642
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home
to roost never made me sad.

02:27:19.844 --> 02:27:21.869
In fact, it's only made me glad.

02:27:31.122 --> 02:27:32.419
Did you...

02:27:33.424 --> 02:27:35.915
...read the paper today?

02:27:38.696 --> 02:27:40.357
Yes, sir. I did.

02:27:43.634 --> 02:27:48.571
That was a bad statement you made.

02:27:50.708 --> 02:27:54.337
You knew from my instructions...

02:27:54.612 --> 02:27:59.549
...no minister was to make
any statements against this man.

02:27:59.750 --> 02:28:02.275
The country loved this man.

02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:04.451
You have made it...

02:28:04.889 --> 02:28:06.049
...hard...

02:28:06.891 --> 02:28:08.552
...for Muslims...

02:28:08.926 --> 02:28:10.791
...in general.

02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:14.422
Yes, sir.

02:28:14.632 --> 02:28:19.433
We must disassociate ourselves...

02:28:19.637 --> 02:28:21.935
...from your terrible blunder.

02:28:24.475 --> 02:28:26.466
I must silence you.

02:28:27.078 --> 02:28:28.978
For 90 days...

02:28:32.149 --> 02:28:36.245
...you must not make any statements
to the press...

02:28:36.987 --> 02:28:41.321
...nor are you to speak
at any temples.

02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:43.820
Yes, sir.

02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:48.330
Yes, sir.
I submit 100 percent.

02:29:46.791 --> 02:29:47.883
Leave us alone.

02:29:48.959 --> 02:29:51.189
Leave us alone.
Stop calling here.

02:29:51.395 --> 02:29:54.831
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

02:29:55.132 --> 02:29:56.565
Stop it!

02:30:09.346 --> 02:30:10.677
It's all right.

02:30:11.182 --> 02:30:12.843
They keep calling!

02:30:14.018 --> 02:30:15.849
They keep calling!

02:30:18.422 --> 02:30:19.719
Just...

02:30:21.425 --> 02:30:23.484
...take the babies and put them to bed.

02:30:24.195 --> 02:30:26.527
Come on, babies.
Let's go to bed now.

02:30:27.031 --> 02:30:28.692
-Bedtime.
-Come on.

02:30:29.266 --> 02:30:30.255
Let's go.

02:30:32.002 --> 02:30:35.597
-Good night, Mommy.
-Good night, Daddy.

02:30:50.855 --> 02:30:53.551
Brother Minister,
I have to level with you.

02:30:54.391 --> 02:30:56.382
They gave me a mission...

02:30:56.794 --> 02:30:58.193
...but I couldn't do it.

02:30:59.263 --> 02:31:01.823
-I love you all.
-What kind of mission?

02:31:04.635 --> 02:31:06.603
To wire your car...

02:31:06.804 --> 02:31:09.136
...so it would explode...

02:31:09.573 --> 02:31:11.837
...when you turned the ignition.

02:31:13.143 --> 02:31:17.136
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

02:31:17.581 --> 02:31:20.448
They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

02:31:20.651 --> 02:31:22.141
...a Judas...

02:31:22.553 --> 02:31:24.487
...a Benedict Arnold.

02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:29.485
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

02:31:29.994 --> 02:31:33.225
...and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

02:31:33.964 --> 02:31:35.693
And what do you say?

02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:37.629
I'm with you, Brother Minister.

02:31:37.835 --> 02:31:39.302
You'll be marked for death.

02:31:39.937 --> 02:31:41.097
Yes, sir.

02:31:42.172 --> 02:31:43.196
Let me die then.

02:31:56.687 --> 02:31:58.882
I can't come between you
and your father.

02:31:59.356 --> 02:32:01.620
-You're my father.
-Go on home.

02:32:03.694 --> 02:32:05.855
Don't come back.
That's an order.

02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:15.062
Yes, sir.

02:32:27.451 --> 02:32:31.387
Because 1964 threatens to be an
explosive year on the racial front...

02:32:31.588 --> 02:32:36.218
...I have called this press conference
to clarify my position.

02:32:36.527 --> 02:32:40.463
Internal differences have forced me
out of the Nation of Islam.

02:32:40.664 --> 02:32:44.691
In the past, I thought and spoke
the words of Elijah Muhammad.

02:32:44.902 --> 02:32:46.802
Everything I said,
I started with:

02:32:47.004 --> 02:32:50.303
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us" thus-and-so.

02:32:50.574 --> 02:32:52.201
That day is over.

02:32:52.409 --> 02:32:56.106
From now on I speak my own words,
and I think my own thoughts.

02:32:56.313 --> 02:32:59.043
<i>Now that I have</i>
<i>more independence of action...</i>

02:32:59.249 --> 02:33:02.650
<i>...I'll use a more flexible approach</i>
<i>in working with others...</i>

02:33:02.853 --> 02:33:04.480
<i>...to solve this problem.</i>

02:33:04.688 --> 02:33:06.986
I'm not out to fight
other Negro leaders.

02:33:07.191 --> 02:33:10.649
L"ve forgotten every bad thing
other leaders said about me...

02:33:10.861 --> 02:33:14.661
...and I pray they'll forget the many
bad things I said about them.

02:33:14.865 --> 02:33:18.926
We must work together to find a common
solution to a common problem.

02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:22.371
<i>I will organize</i>
<i>and lead a new mosque in New York:</i>

02:33:22.573 --> 02:33:24.268
<i>Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.</i>

02:33:24.708 --> 02:33:28.200
<i>This gives us the religious base</i>
<i>and the spiritual force...</i>

02:33:28.412 --> 02:33:31.040
<i>...necessary to rid our people</i>
<i>of the vices...</i>

02:33:31.281 --> 02:33:33.613
<i>...that destroy</i>
<i>our community's moral fiber.</i>

02:33:33.817 --> 02:33:36.183
Our politics
will be Black Nationalism...

02:33:36.387 --> 02:33:39.447
...meaning, we want to control
our community's politics.

02:33:39.656 --> 02:33:42.090
The Muslim Mosque, Inc.
Will remain open...

02:33:42.292 --> 02:33:45.557
...for ideas and financial aid
from all quarters.

02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:49.065
Whites can help us,
but they can't join us.

02:33:49.299 --> 02:33:52.757
There can't be black-white unity
until there's first black unity.

02:33:53.037 --> 02:33:54.664
We can't unite with others...

02:33:54.872 --> 02:33:57.773
...until we've first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

02:33:57.975 --> 02:34:00.102
We can't be acceptable to others...

02:34:00.310 --> 02:34:03.040
...until we have first
proven acceptable to ourselves.

02:34:03.247 --> 02:34:06.739
<i>In my desire to fully understand</i>
<i>the religion of Islam...</i>

02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:11.046
<i>...as practiced by 750 million</i>
<i>Muslims around the world...</i>

02:34:11.255 --> 02:34:15.658
<i>...I intend to make a pilgrimage,</i>
<i>or holy journey, to Mecca.</i>

02:34:15.859 --> 02:34:18.623
<i>This pilgrimage is</i>
<i>a religious requirement...</i>

02:34:18.829 --> 02:34:21.389
<i>...or duty,</i>
<i>of every Muslim that is able...</i>

02:34:21.598 --> 02:34:25.364
<i>...to make the pilgrimage</i>
<i>at least once in his lifetime.</i>

02:34:39.316 --> 02:34:40.908
I'm Egyptian. And you?

02:34:41.218 --> 02:34:42.310
American.

02:34:42.519 --> 02:34:43.577
What's your name?

02:34:43.787 --> 02:34:46.085
Malcolm.

02:35:00.404 --> 02:35:02.531
-How much?
-Twenty Egyptian pounds.

02:35:03.307 --> 02:35:04.535
For one?

02:35:04.741 --> 02:35:07.107
-Special price for you.
-Special for me!

02:35:07.311 --> 02:35:10.712
Okay, thank you.
Where can I get a better price?

02:35:16.186 --> 02:35:18.086
-What's your name?
-Mohammed.

02:35:18.288 --> 02:35:19.846
Mohammed, I'm Malcolm.

02:35:20.991 --> 02:35:23.482
-Malcolm X. And you?
-Gamaal.

02:35:23.727 --> 02:35:27.686
All right, Gamaal. I'm from Harlem.
From the United States.

02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:32.469
-Hareem?
-No, not Hareem. Harlem.

02:35:32.669 --> 02:35:34.534
Can you show me around?

02:35:34.738 --> 02:35:37.229
-Hash?
-No. No hashish.

02:35:39.243 --> 02:35:40.767
You know, the pyramids.

02:35:41.678 --> 02:35:44.169
No, pyramids, pyramids, pyramids.

02:35:49.987 --> 02:35:51.352
You're gonna take me?

02:35:52.689 --> 02:35:54.884
Sphinx! Sphinx!

02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.069
<i>My darling Betty:</i>

02:37:18.575 --> 02:37:22.568
<i>Everywhere I go, I am welcomed</i>
<i>as a representative of our people.</i>

02:37:22.946 --> 02:37:26.109
<i>Our struggle is known</i>
<i>and respected worldwide.</i>

02:37:26.617 --> 02:37:30.383
<i>Coincidentally, two white men</i>
<i>follow me around wherever I go.</i>

02:37:30.754 --> 02:37:32.688
<i>I wonder who they're working for?</i>

02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:35.658
<i>If I was a betting man,</i>
<i>I'd say the CIA.</i>

02:37:35.859 --> 02:37:37.019
<i>What's your guess?</i>

02:37:38.028 --> 02:37:40.053
<i>Today I arrived in Arabia.</i>

02:37:40.697 --> 02:37:44.599
<i>I have never witnessed</i>
<i>such sincere hospitality...</i>

02:37:44.801 --> 02:37:46.894
...and true brotherhood...

02:37:47.104 --> 02:37:48.731
<i>...as practiced here...</i>

02:37:48.939 --> 02:37:52.204
<i>...in the ancient</i>
<i>home of Abraham, Mohammed...</i>

02:37:52.743 --> 02:37:55.940
<i>...and the great prophets</i>
<i>of the Scriptures. "</i>

02:38:02.219 --> 02:38:04.779
<i>Today, with thousands of others...</i>

02:38:04.988 --> 02:38:08.549
<i>...I proclaimed God's greatness</i>
<i>in the sacred city of Mecca.</i>

02:38:09.626 --> 02:38:13.062
<i>In the</i> ihram <i>garb, I made</i>
<i>my seven circuits around the Kaaba.</i>

02:38:13.664 --> 02:38:15.962
<i>I drank from the well of Zem Zem.</i>

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:19.164
<i>I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.</i>

02:38:19.469 --> 02:38:23.371
<i>It was the only time in my life that</i>
<i>I stood before the Creator...</i>

02:38:23.573 --> 02:38:26.064
<i>...and felt</i>
<i>like a complete human being.</i>

02:38:46.263 --> 02:38:48.823
<i>Now, you may be shocked</i>
<i>by these words...</i>

02:38:49.032 --> 02:38:52.900
<i>...but I've eaten from the same plate,</i>
<i>drunk from the same glass...</i>

02:38:53.103 --> 02:38:57.096
<i>...and prayed to the same God</i>
<i>with Muslims whose eyes were blue...</i>

02:38:57.307 --> 02:39:01.573
<i>...whose hair was blond, and whose</i>
<i>skin was the whitest of white.</i>

02:39:01.778 --> 02:39:03.507
<i>And we were all brothers...</i>

02:39:03.714 --> 02:39:04.738
<i>...truly.</i>

02:39:04.948 --> 02:39:09.885
<i>People of all colors and races</i>
<i>believing in one God, in one humanity.</i>

02:39:24.201 --> 02:39:26.431
<i>Each hour in this sacred land</i>
<i>gives me...</i>

02:39:26.636 --> 02:39:30.231
<i>...greater spiritual insight into</i>
<i>what is happening in America.</i>

02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:34.940
<i>The American Negro can never</i>
<i>be blamed for his racial animosities.</i>

02:39:35.145 --> 02:39:39.104
<i>He's only reacting to 400 years of</i>
<i>oppression and discrimination.</i>

02:39:39.316 --> 02:39:42.774
<i>But as racism leads America</i>
<i>up the suicidal path...</i>

02:39:42.986 --> 02:39:46.615
<i>...I believe the younger generation</i>
<i>will see the writing on the wall...</i>

02:39:46.823 --> 02:39:50.224
<i>...and many will want to turn to</i>
<i>the spiritual path of truth...</i>

02:39:50.427 --> 02:39:53.157
<i>...the only way left to ward off</i>
<i>the disaster...</i>

02:39:53.363 --> 02:39:55.331
<i>...that racism must surely lead to.</i>

02:39:56.266 --> 02:40:00.396
<i>Once before, in prison,</i>
<i>the truth came and blinded me.</i>

02:40:01.505 --> 02:40:03.200
<i>Well, it has happened again.</i>

02:40:04.241 --> 02:40:07.768
<i>In the past, I've made sweeping</i>
<i>indictments of all white people.</i>

02:40:08.011 --> 02:40:10.639
<i>And these generalizations</i>
<i>have caused injuries...</i>

02:40:10.847 --> 02:40:13.338
<i>...to some whites</i>
<i>who didn't deserve them.</i>

02:40:14.451 --> 02:40:18.444
"Because of the spiritual rebirth
which I was blessed to undergo...

02:40:18.655 --> 02:40:20.816
...as a result of my pilgrimage...

02:40:21.024 --> 02:40:23.117
...to the holy city of Mecca...

02:40:24.895 --> 02:40:28.661
...I no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

02:40:28.932 --> 02:40:30.365
<i>I intend...</i>

02:40:31.301 --> 02:40:33.496
<i>...to be very careful not to....</i>

02:40:33.703 --> 02:40:37.503
--<i>careful not to sentence anyone</i>
<i>who has not been proven guilty.</i>

02:40:38.141 --> 02:40:40.166
<i>I am not a racist...</i>

02:40:40.377 --> 02:40:43.676
<i>...and I do not subscribe to any</i>
<i>of the tenets of racism.</i>

02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.780
<i>In all honesty and sincerity...</i>

02:40:45.982 --> 02:40:50.078
<i>...it can be stated that I wish</i>
<i>nothing but freedom, justice...</i>

02:40:50.287 --> 02:40:51.948
<i>...and equality...</i>

02:40:52.589 --> 02:40:57.322
<i>...life, liberty and the pursuit</i>
<i>of happiness for all people.</i>

02:40:57.727 --> 02:41:00.958
<i>My first concern is with the group</i>
<i>to which I belong...</i>

02:41:01.164 --> 02:41:05.294
<i>...for we, more than others, are</i>
<i>deprived of our inalienable rights.</i>

02:41:05.502 --> 02:41:07.493
<i>But the true practice of Islam...</i>

02:41:07.704 --> 02:41:09.695
<i>...can remove the cancer of racism...</i>

02:41:09.906 --> 02:41:13.535
<i>...from the hearts and the souls</i>
<i>of all Americans.</i>

02:41:13.743 --> 02:41:16.041
<i>If I can die</i>
<i>having brought any light...</i>

02:41:16.246 --> 02:41:21.183
<i>...having exposed any truth that</i>
<i>will help destroy this disease...</i>

02:41:21.918 --> 02:41:25.854
<i>...then all the credit is due to Allah,</i>
<i>the Lord of all the worlds.</i>

02:41:26.323 --> 02:41:28.757
<i>And only the mistakes have been mine.</i>

02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:32.692
<i>Please give all my love</i>
<i>to the children.</i>

02:41:33.196 --> 02:41:34.754
<i>I love you dearly.</i>

02:41:35.699 --> 02:41:38.930
<i>Sincerely,</i>
<i>El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz...</i>

02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:40.930
<i>...Malcolm X.</i>

02:42:28.685 --> 02:42:29.811
<i>Let's begin.</i>

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:34.389
<i>You said on your trip you sensed</i>
<i>a feeling of great brotherhood.</i>

02:42:34.591 --> 02:42:38.823
<i>Yes, when I was in Mecca</i>
<i>making the pilgrimage...</i>

02:42:39.729 --> 02:42:43.961
<i>...the brotherhood that existed there</i>
<i>among all people, all races...</i>

02:42:44.167 --> 02:42:48.194
<i>...all levels of people who</i>
<i>had accepted the religion of Islam...</i>

02:42:49.172 --> 02:42:53.768
<i>...what it had done</i>
<i>for those people, despite...</i>

02:42:53.977 --> 02:42:55.945
<i>...their complexion differences....</i>

02:42:56.146 --> 02:42:59.377
<i>Perhaps if people</i>
<i>here in America would try...</i>

02:42:59.583 --> 02:43:03.178
...and practice and study the religion
of Islam, it might help...

02:43:03.386 --> 02:43:07.220
...to erase the plague of racism here.

02:43:07.691 --> 02:43:10.922
I think Muslims over there
look at themselves as...

02:43:11.127 --> 02:43:16.064
...human beings, as part of
the same human family.

02:43:16.533 --> 02:43:18.933
Today my friends are black...

02:43:19.235 --> 02:43:21.635
...red, yellow, brown and white.

02:43:21.838 --> 02:43:26.741
Are you prepared to ask the UN
to bring charges against the U.S...

02:43:26.943 --> 02:43:28.570
...for its treatment of Negroes?

02:43:28.778 --> 02:43:30.678
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

02:43:32.616 --> 02:43:35.107
The audience will have to be quiet.

02:43:35.919 --> 02:43:37.614
<i>Please, please.</i>

02:43:38.555 --> 02:43:41.217
<i>Yes, as I stated earlier...</i>

02:43:42.225 --> 02:43:45.319
<i>...those nations,</i>
<i>African, Latin, Asian nations...</i>

02:43:45.528 --> 02:43:48.520
<i>...are hypocritical</i>
<i>when they stand up in the UN...</i>

02:43:48.732 --> 02:43:52.133
<i>...and denounce the racism practiced</i>
<i>in South Africa, but...</i>

02:43:52.335 --> 02:43:54.963
...say absolutely nothing about...

02:43:55.238 --> 02:43:58.366
...the practice of racism here
in American society.

02:43:58.575 --> 02:44:01.237
Now, I wouldn't be a man
if I didn't do so.

02:44:01.444 --> 02:44:06.381
Will you work now with leaders
of other civil rights organizations?

02:44:06.583 --> 02:44:10.644
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organizations...

02:44:10.854 --> 02:44:14.415
...as long as they're
genuinely interested in results.

02:44:14.624 --> 02:44:15.556
Positive results.

02:44:15.759 --> 02:44:18.489
Does your new beard have any
religious significance?

02:44:19.763 --> 02:44:21.856
No, not particularly, but...

02:44:22.198 --> 02:44:25.690
...I think that as black people
in America strive...

02:44:25.902 --> 02:44:29.463
...to throw off the shackles
of mental colonialism...

02:44:29.673 --> 02:44:31.698
...they'll also reflect
their desire...

02:44:31.908 --> 02:44:34.900
...to throw off the shackles of
cultural colonialism.

02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:38.911
I believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

02:44:39.115 --> 02:44:41.140
...not necessarily a physical one...

02:44:41.351 --> 02:44:44.946
...but a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

02:44:45.155 --> 02:44:49.285
...which means we reaffirm our bond
with our brothers over there...

02:44:49.592 --> 02:44:53.756
...would help to strengthen
black people in America.

02:44:53.963 --> 02:44:57.262
Not only spiritually,
but it would give us the incentive...

02:44:57.467 --> 02:45:00.664
...to solve some of our problems
here at home.

02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:03.464
One of your
more controversial remarks...

02:45:03.673 --> 02:45:06.801
...called for black people to get
rifles and form clubs.

02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:08.705
Do you still favor that idea?

02:45:08.878 --> 02:45:10.903
Why is that controversial?

02:45:11.114 --> 02:45:14.015
If white people find themselves
the victims of...

02:45:14.217 --> 02:45:18.745
...the violence black people found
themselves victims of in America...

02:45:18.955 --> 02:45:22.686
...and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything...

02:45:22.892 --> 02:45:26.020
...it'd be intelligence on their part
to defend themselves.

02:45:26.229 --> 02:45:27.753
What about the guns?

02:45:29.632 --> 02:45:33.432
When you tell your people to stop
being violent against my people...

02:45:33.636 --> 02:45:35.695
...l'll tell them
to put away their guns.

02:45:35.905 --> 02:45:37.429
So you're still an extremist.

02:45:37.741 --> 02:45:39.606
<i>Get your hand out of my pocket!</i>

02:45:46.616 --> 02:45:47.446
Next question.

02:46:07.704 --> 02:46:11.401
<i>Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.</i>

02:46:11.975 --> 02:46:15.911
<i>Your days on this earth are</i>
<i>numbered, brother.</i>

02:46:28.291 --> 02:46:29.417
Come to bed.

02:46:30.026 --> 02:46:31.789
Get some rest.

02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:38.790
I'm sorry, Betty.

02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:41.428
Sorry for what?

02:46:41.638 --> 02:46:45.301
I haven't been the best husband
or the best father.

02:46:45.508 --> 02:46:48.102
A family shouldn't be separated
like ours has been.

02:46:48.311 --> 02:46:51.974
I promise I'll never make a long trip
without you and the children.

02:46:55.652 --> 02:46:57.210
I miss you and the girls.

02:47:03.326 --> 02:47:05.317
We will be together,
I promise you that.

02:47:06.663 --> 02:47:07.721
Dear heart....

02:47:10.066 --> 02:47:11.556
I love you.

02:47:16.272 --> 02:47:17.864
Thank you.

02:47:25.381 --> 02:47:27.178
Now get some sleep.

02:47:32.088 --> 02:47:35.353
We had the best organization
the black man has ever seen.

02:47:36.759 --> 02:47:38.056
Niggers ruined it.

02:48:09.292 --> 02:48:10.589
Wake up!

02:48:14.731 --> 02:48:16.130
Come on! Let's get up!

02:48:16.332 --> 02:48:18.698
Girls, come on! Come on!
Out! Out!

02:48:19.068 --> 02:48:20.558
Outside! Out!

02:48:22.705 --> 02:48:25.105
Go, go! Run, run!

02:48:25.308 --> 02:48:27.538
Go across the street!

02:48:27.744 --> 02:48:30.679
-Somebody call the fire department!
-Help! Help!

02:48:32.048 --> 02:48:34.073
Call the fire department, please!

02:48:34.284 --> 02:48:36.309
Somebody call the fire department!

02:48:36.519 --> 02:48:37.781
I'm a man!

02:48:37.987 --> 02:48:39.215
Evidently...

02:48:40.657 --> 02:48:44.559
...some type of bomb was thrown against
the back of the house.

02:48:44.761 --> 02:48:47.787
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what I see.

02:48:50.934 --> 02:48:53.903
It bounced up against the window
and woke my daughter.

02:48:54.103 --> 02:48:57.072
Had it gone inside,
my 2-year-old, my 4-year-old...

02:48:57.273 --> 02:48:59.002
...and my 6-year-old daughter....

02:48:59.676 --> 02:49:02.076
Had that happened,
I'd have taken my rifle...

02:49:02.278 --> 02:49:03.905
...and gone after anyone in sight.

02:49:04.113 --> 02:49:06.911
Was this a warning
or an attempt on your life?

02:49:07.116 --> 02:49:09.516
What, does it look like
a warning to you?

02:49:09.719 --> 02:49:11.448
This was a definite attempt...

02:49:11.788 --> 02:49:15.417
...by the Nation of Islam, upon
the strict orders of Elijah Muhammad.

02:49:15.625 --> 02:49:18.719
-Muslim headquarters say--
-I don't care what they say.

02:49:18.928 --> 02:49:20.293
I see what they're doing.

02:49:20.496 --> 02:49:24.159
Minister Baines, can you tell us
who bombed the house?

02:49:24.434 --> 02:49:28.302
We feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X.

02:49:28.538 --> 02:49:30.130
We hope it's not so that...

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:33.434
...if he can't keep the house,
we won't get it either.

02:49:33.643 --> 02:49:35.133
That's enough. Excuse me.

02:49:41.718 --> 02:49:42.946
I'm all right. I'm all right.

02:49:43.152 --> 02:49:44.949
-Betty and the kids?
-They're fine.

02:49:45.154 --> 02:49:47.349
Let's post some
men in front of the house.

02:49:47.557 --> 02:49:50.458
-Did you see anybody?
-No, but I know who it is.

02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:53.026
-You know I know who did it.
-Give us the command.

02:49:53.229 --> 02:49:56.995
Don't worry about the command.
Two men on post, two in front!

02:50:31.401 --> 02:50:32.493
Spark it.

02:50:42.612 --> 02:50:44.603
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brothers.

02:50:47.383 --> 02:50:50.113
-Here's your key. Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

02:50:53.890 --> 02:50:55.551
O.A.A.U.

02:50:56.926 --> 02:50:58.985
Brother Earl, it's Malcolm.

02:51:02.298 --> 02:51:05.859
Where are you? We've been calling
all over the city.

02:51:06.135 --> 02:51:07.466
Hold the phone.

02:51:16.012 --> 02:51:17.912
<i>I'm downtown.</i>

02:51:18.247 --> 02:51:21.546
<i>I'm in a hotel trying</i>
<i>to get some work done for tomorrow.</i>

02:51:21.751 --> 02:51:24.584
-Let me bring some brothers there.
-<i>That's all right.</i>

02:51:24.887 --> 02:51:26.980
<i>I wish you'd listen to us.</i>

02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:30.387
We must frisk people
at the Audubon Ballroom meeting.

02:51:30.593 --> 02:51:33.118
No, no! I don't want....

02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:35.420
I don't want anybody frisked.

02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:39.625
We have to change our way of thinking.

02:51:39.836 --> 02:51:41.963
We have to make people
feel comfortable.

02:51:42.171 --> 02:51:45.732
<i>If I can't be safe around my own kind,</i>
<i>who can I be safe around?</i>

02:51:45.942 --> 02:51:47.773
<i>I trust Allah will protect me.</i>

02:51:47.977 --> 02:51:52.209
Believing in Allah is one thing,
but I also believe in being armed.

02:51:55.451 --> 02:51:59.114
We don't want black people
killing each other, all right?

02:52:01.557 --> 02:52:02.581
All right?

02:52:02.792 --> 02:52:04.521
We'll protect you, Malcolm.

02:52:05.294 --> 02:52:06.522
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

02:52:06.729 --> 02:52:09.357
<i>No, peace be unto you, Earl.</i>

02:52:47.069 --> 02:52:49.401
Do you have a Malcolm X registered?

02:53:46.996 --> 02:53:50.432
<i>Your red nigger is dead</i>
<i>and so are your bastard children!</i>

02:54:15.725 --> 02:54:17.249
<i>Wake up, brother.</i>

02:54:17.827 --> 02:54:19.692
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

02:54:27.937 --> 02:54:31.429
You hear me and hear me well.
You come anywhere near my family...

02:54:31.674 --> 02:54:33.608
-...and I will kill you.
-<i>Betty?</i>

02:54:33.809 --> 02:54:35.106
Do you hear?

02:54:36.279 --> 02:54:37.803
Betty, it's me, Malcolm.

02:54:44.553 --> 02:54:46.248
They keep calling.

02:54:46.455 --> 02:54:49.754
They keep threatening. I go crazy
every time a phone rings.

02:54:49.959 --> 02:54:53.156
Just don't answer the phone.
Everything'll be all right.

02:54:53.362 --> 02:54:55.853
-<i>When will it stop?</i>
-<i>Don't answer the phone.</i>

02:54:57.033 --> 02:54:59.126
<i>Are the brothers there on post?</i>

02:55:00.136 --> 02:55:01.433
They're outside.

02:55:01.637 --> 02:55:04.435
<i>Let them answer the phone.</i>
<i>Don't touch the phone.</i>

02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:05.834
Beloved, where are you?

02:55:06.042 --> 02:55:07.737
I'm in a hotel.

02:55:09.145 --> 02:55:09.975
In a hotel.

02:55:10.379 --> 02:55:11.812
<i>The girls asleep?</i>

02:55:13.215 --> 02:55:16.309
I just put them down to bed.

02:55:17.219 --> 02:55:19.380
<i>Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?</i>

02:55:21.691 --> 02:55:23.318
No, I don't think so.

02:55:24.327 --> 02:55:27.160
<i>The girls and I want to see you.</i>
<i>We miss you.</i>

02:55:28.064 --> 02:55:30.055
Betty, it's too dangerous.

02:55:30.833 --> 02:55:32.960
<i>It's been dangerous.</i>

02:55:36.138 --> 02:55:39.198
Listen, I haven't told
this to anybody...

02:55:41.911 --> 02:55:43.708
...but I've been thinking...

02:55:43.913 --> 02:55:47.246
...about what's been happening to me
lately, to us lately...

02:55:48.084 --> 02:55:51.485
...and I'm gonna stop saying
The Nation of Islam's behind this.

02:55:51.687 --> 02:55:55.088
I know what they can and can't do.
I trained them.

02:55:56.926 --> 02:56:00.020
Some of the things that have
been happening lately....

02:56:02.098 --> 02:56:05.329
I'm gonna stop staying it's just
The Nation of Islam.

02:56:05.534 --> 02:56:07.593
They're not working alone.

02:56:08.204 --> 02:56:10.069
They're getting a lot of help.

02:56:10.272 --> 02:56:12.035
<i>Are you sure?</i>

02:56:12.942 --> 02:56:14.375
<i>I miss you, Betty.</i>

02:56:18.013 --> 02:56:20.413
<i>You're with us</i>
<i>even when you're away.</i>

02:56:20.616 --> 02:56:23.949
<i>Now listen, you come on down to</i>
<i>the Audubon tomorrow.</i>

02:56:25.054 --> 02:56:28.683
<i>We'll be all right.</i>
<i>We're not gonna let this get us down.</i>

02:56:28.891 --> 02:56:31.018
<i>You come on down.</i>
<i>Bring the girls too.</i>

02:56:31.227 --> 02:56:33.718
<i>The girls and I miss you so much.</i>

02:56:34.063 --> 02:56:35.189
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

02:56:35.398 --> 02:56:37.491
Compared to IKing, this guy's a monk.

02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:39.725
<i>Good night.</i>
<i>Sleep well. I love you.</i>

02:56:39.935 --> 02:56:40.765
<i>Good night.</i>

02:56:53.783 --> 02:56:56.445
Sweetheart, Attallah, sit back.

02:56:56.652 --> 02:56:59.849
Sit up.
Sit up straight.

02:57:25.181 --> 02:57:27.775
Mama, I want the doll!

02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:15.297
Sister?

02:58:19.068 --> 02:58:22.003
-What do you say to the nice man?
-Thank you.

02:58:22.204 --> 02:58:24.331
You're very welcome,
my beautiful sister.

02:58:25.474 --> 02:58:26.532
Bye-bye.

02:58:42.925 --> 02:58:45.223
The minister hasn't arrived yet.

02:58:45.528 --> 02:58:48.053
Don't worry.
He'll be here like clockwork.

02:59:21.163 --> 02:59:22.255
Son?

02:59:22.464 --> 02:59:23.556
Son?

02:59:24.733 --> 02:59:26.200
Are you all right?

02:59:26.435 --> 02:59:27.459
Are you okay?

02:59:30.839 --> 02:59:33.205
Good.
I recognize you.

02:59:33.409 --> 02:59:35.934
Don't you pay them folks
no never mind.

02:59:36.145 --> 02:59:38.773
You just keep right on doing
what you doing.

02:59:40.849 --> 02:59:41.975
Yes, ma'am.

02:59:42.651 --> 02:59:44.915
-I'll pray for you, son.
-Well, thank you.

02:59:45.321 --> 02:59:47.186
Jesus will protect you.

03:00:01.637 --> 03:00:03.400
Is the charter ready?

03:00:03.606 --> 03:00:05.403
No, Brother Minister.

03:00:07.009 --> 03:00:08.442
No? Why not?

03:00:10.846 --> 03:00:12.746
You had enough time, didn't you?

03:00:12.948 --> 03:00:15.246
I apologize.
We'll have it next week.

03:00:15.451 --> 03:00:17.749
We don't have next week.
We need it today.

03:00:17.953 --> 03:00:20.319
The people want to hear
the charter today.

03:00:20.522 --> 03:00:22.183
Next week, Minister.

03:00:28.664 --> 03:00:30.029
Is the reverend here?

03:00:30.366 --> 03:00:33.665
The reverend called and said
he wouldn't be able to attend.

03:00:35.137 --> 03:00:38.629
So now we don't have
an opening speaker or a charter....

03:00:39.441 --> 03:00:42.274
Why didn't you say this last night
when I talked to you?

03:00:42.478 --> 03:00:45.345
-I called Sister Betty.
-You didn't have to call her!

03:00:45.547 --> 03:00:47.515
You should've told me!
Why tell her?

03:00:47.716 --> 03:00:49.980
-I assumed that--
-Don't assume anything!

03:01:00.529 --> 03:01:01.689
Go on down front.

03:01:01.997 --> 03:01:04.557
-Sister, you go on with the brother.
-Yes, sir.

03:01:23.218 --> 03:01:24.412
What's wrong?

03:01:28.924 --> 03:01:31.256
It's a time for martyrs now.

03:01:34.963 --> 03:01:36.828
The way I feel...

03:01:38.267 --> 03:01:40.326
...I shouldn't go out there today.

03:01:41.937 --> 03:01:44.428
Fine. Let's cancel it.

03:01:47.443 --> 03:01:49.604
My wife out there?
My children?

03:01:50.012 --> 03:01:52.003
Down front, as always.

03:01:55.017 --> 03:01:57.679
Go out to the pay phone outside.

03:01:59.188 --> 03:02:03.488
Call up the reverend,
see if he can make it down here.

03:02:03.692 --> 03:02:05.489
I gotta be on post.

03:02:05.694 --> 03:02:07.855
I'm supposed to be
guarding you.

03:02:08.063 --> 03:02:13.000
-Besides, that's a duty for secretaries--
-Go out to the pay phone.

03:02:13.535 --> 03:02:15.127
Call up the reverend.

03:02:15.637 --> 03:02:17.468
See if he can make it down here.

03:02:21.944 --> 03:02:23.138
Fine.

03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:19.762
Thank you.

03:03:24.573 --> 03:03:27.406
I apologize for
raising my voice earlier.

03:03:27.609 --> 03:03:29.201
It was very disrespectful.

03:03:29.444 --> 03:03:31.935
Brother Minister, I understand.

03:03:40.889 --> 03:03:42.186
Why styles are changing...

03:03:42.524 --> 03:03:45.322
...minds are changing,
why everything is changing.

03:03:45.994 --> 03:03:50.055
So you and I must consider that
we're living in very changing times.

03:03:50.465 --> 03:03:53.923
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

03:03:54.837 --> 03:03:57.499
And without any further ado,
I present to you...

03:03:57.973 --> 03:04:00.669
...Brother Minister Malcolm.
And I pray...

03:04:01.143 --> 03:04:04.840
...that you and I will listen.
Listen...

03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:07.971
...hear and understand.

03:04:08.183 --> 03:04:09.013
Thank you.

03:04:16.024 --> 03:04:17.389
Daddy!

03:04:31.673 --> 03:04:33.834
Get your hand out of my pocket!

03:04:35.611 --> 03:04:36.703
Brother....

03:04:36.912 --> 03:04:38.004
Please. Hold it.

03:04:39.681 --> 03:04:41.672
Calm down.
Please, brothers!

03:04:41.884 --> 03:04:42.816
Brothers....

03:05:24.559 --> 03:05:26.652
Get an ambulance!

03:05:26.862 --> 03:05:27.886
Get an ambulance!

03:05:28.163 --> 03:05:29.289
They killed him!

03:05:31.066 --> 03:05:33.057
They killed him!

03:06:52.080 --> 03:06:53.513
Get out of the way!

03:06:58.787 --> 03:06:59.617
Move!

03:07:07.996 --> 03:07:09.361
Stand back!

03:07:09.898 --> 03:07:10.887
Get back!

03:07:12.834 --> 03:07:15.302
Give us a statement, sir!
Please!

03:07:15.504 --> 03:07:18.940
The person you know
as Malcolm X is no more.

03:07:19.274 --> 03:07:21.265
The assassination...

03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:25.105
...of Malcolm X
was an unfortunate tragedy.

03:07:25.514 --> 03:07:28.176
And it reveals
that there are still...

03:07:28.517 --> 03:07:31.611
...numerous people
in our nation who have...

03:07:31.853 --> 03:07:36.517
...degenerated to the point of
expressing dissent through murder...

03:07:36.792 --> 03:07:39.090
...and we haven't learned
to disagree...

03:07:39.294 --> 03:07:41.353
...without being
violently disagreeable.

03:07:42.631 --> 03:07:43.689
<i>Here...</i>

03:07:44.466 --> 03:07:47.128
<i>...at this final hour...</i>

03:07:47.702 --> 03:07:49.966
<i>...in this quiet place...</i>

03:07:50.672 --> 03:07:52.970
<i>...Harlem has come to bid farewell...</i>

03:07:53.175 --> 03:07:55.575
<i>...to one of its brightest hopes...</i>

03:07:56.611 --> 03:07:58.579
<i>...extinguished now...</i>

03:07:59.047 --> 03:08:01.709
<i>...and gone from us forever.</i>

03:08:02.617 --> 03:08:05.643
<i>It is not in the memory</i>
<i>of man that this...</i>

03:08:05.854 --> 03:08:07.412
<i>...beleaguered, unfortunate...</i>

03:08:07.622 --> 03:08:09.749
<i>...but nonetheless proud community...</i>

03:08:10.158 --> 03:08:14.561
<i>...has found a braver,</i>
<i>more gallant young champion...</i>

03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:18.288
<i>...than this Afro-American</i>
<i>who lies before us...</i>

03:08:19.234 --> 03:08:21.225
<i>...unconquered still.</i>

03:08:23.138 --> 03:08:25.504
<i>I say the word again as</i>
<i>he would want me to:</i>

03:08:25.707 --> 03:08:27.072
<i>Afro-American.</i>

03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:30.608
<i>Afro-American Malcolm.</i>

03:08:30.812 --> 03:08:33.542
<i>Malcolm had stopped being "Negro"...</i>

03:08:33.748 --> 03:08:35.079
<i>...years ago.</i>

03:08:35.317 --> 03:08:40.254
<i>It had become too small, too puny,</i>
<i>too weak a word for him.</i>

03:08:40.589 --> 03:08:42.784
<i>Malcolm was bigger than that.</i>

03:08:43.091 --> 03:08:44.388
<i>Malcolm had become...</i>

03:08:44.626 --> 03:08:46.856
<i>...an Afro-American.</i>

03:08:47.129 --> 03:08:49.359
<i>And he wanted so desperately...</i>

03:08:49.898 --> 03:08:52.492
<i>...that we,</i>
<i>that all his people...</i>

03:08:52.701 --> 03:08:55.795
<i>...would become Afro-Americans too.</i>

03:08:59.808 --> 03:09:03.266
<i>There are those who</i>
<i>still consider it their duty...</i>

03:09:03.478 --> 03:09:07.175
<i>...as friends of the Negro people,</i>
<i>to tell us...</i>

03:09:07.716 --> 03:09:09.445
<i>...to revile him.</i>

03:09:09.651 --> 03:09:12.950
<i>To flee, even from</i>
<i>the presence of his memory.</i>

03:09:13.155 --> 03:09:14.679
<i>To save ourselves...</i>

03:09:14.890 --> 03:09:19.452
<i>...by writing him out of</i>
<i>the history of our turbulent times.</i>

03:09:19.828 --> 03:09:21.887
<i>And we will smile.</i>

03:09:22.197 --> 03:09:24.529
<i>They will say that</i>
<i>he is of hate, a fanatic...</i>

03:09:24.733 --> 03:09:27.725
<i>...a racist, who can only bring</i>
<i>evil to the cause...</i>

03:09:27.936 --> 03:09:29.369
<i>...for which you struggle.</i>

03:09:29.571 --> 03:09:32.540
<i>And we will answer and</i>
<i>say unto them:</i>

03:09:32.741 --> 03:09:34.709
<i>"Did you ever talk...</i>

03:09:35.076 --> 03:09:36.737
<i>...to Brother Malcolm?</i>

03:09:37.379 --> 03:09:39.210
<i>Did you ever touch him...</i>

03:09:39.414 --> 03:09:41.541
<i>...or have him smile at you?</i>

03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:44.082
<i>Did you ever really listen to him?"</i>

03:09:46.321 --> 03:09:50.553
<i>"Was he ever associated with violence</i>
<i>or any public disturbance?</i>

03:09:50.759 --> 03:09:53.660
<i>For if you did, you would know him.</i>

03:09:53.862 --> 03:09:55.352
<i>And if you knew him...</i>

03:09:55.597 --> 03:09:59.328
<i>...you would know why</i>
<i>we must honor him. "</i>

03:09:59.534 --> 03:10:03.868
<i>Malcolm was our manhood.</i>
<i>Our living, black manhood.</i>

03:10:04.105 --> 03:10:06.164
<i>This was his meaning</i>
<i>to his people.</i>

03:10:06.441 --> 03:10:11.037
<i>And in honoring him, we honor</i>
<i>the best in ourselves.</i>

03:10:12.414 --> 03:10:15.076
<i>However much we may have</i>
<i>differed with him...</i>

03:10:15.283 --> 03:10:18.343
<i>...or with each other about him</i>
<i>and his value as a man...</i>

03:10:18.553 --> 03:10:20.680
<i>...let his going from us serve...</i>

03:10:20.889 --> 03:10:23.949
<i>...only to bring us together now...</i>

03:10:24.960 --> 03:10:27.622
<i>...consigning these mortal</i>
<i>remains to earth...</i>

03:10:28.129 --> 03:10:30.188
<i>...the common mother of all...</i>

03:10:30.398 --> 03:10:33.731
<i>...secure in the knowledge</i>
<i>that what we place in the ground...</i>

03:10:33.935 --> 03:10:35.266
<i>...is no more now a man...</i>

03:10:35.537 --> 03:10:37.061
<i>...but a seed...</i>

03:10:37.405 --> 03:10:40.374
<i>...which after the winter of</i>
<i>our discontent...</i>

03:10:40.575 --> 03:10:43.442
<i>...will come forth again</i>
<i>to meet us.</i>

03:10:43.645 --> 03:10:45.875
<i>And we shall know him then...</i>

03:10:46.081 --> 03:10:48.948
<i>...for what he was and is:</i>

03:10:49.150 --> 03:10:50.947
<i>A prince.</i>

03:10:51.152 --> 03:10:54.747
<i>Our own black shining prince...</i>

03:10:55.490 --> 03:10:58.653
<i>...who didn't hesitate to die...</i>

03:10:58.994 --> 03:11:00.325
<i>...because...</i>

03:11:00.996 --> 03:11:02.623
<i>...he loved us so.</i>

03:11:03.365 --> 03:11:04.559
<i>And so today...</i>

03:11:04.766 --> 03:11:07.929
...May 19, we celebrate
Malcolm X's birthday...

03:11:08.169 --> 03:11:12.003
...because he was
a great, great Afro-American.

03:11:12.274 --> 03:11:14.936
Malcolm X is you, all of you.

03:11:15.343 --> 03:11:17.402
And you are Malcolm X.

03:11:17.946 --> 03:11:18.970
I'm Malcolm X!

03:11:19.180 --> 03:11:20.238
I'm Malcolm X!

03:11:20.515 --> 03:11:21.413
I'm Malcolm X!

03:11:30.859 --> 03:11:33.350
As Brother Malcolm said:

03:11:36.197 --> 03:11:38.131
"We declare...

03:11:39.467 --> 03:11:41.128
...our right...

03:11:43.271 --> 03:11:44.966
...on this earth...

03:11:46.341 --> 03:11:47.933
...to be a man...

03:11:50.178 --> 03:11:52.339
...to be a human being...

03:11:54.616 --> 03:11:57.016
...to be given the rights...

03:11:57.786 --> 03:11:59.515
...of a human being...

03:12:01.356 --> 03:12:03.187
...to be respected...

03:12:04.359 --> 03:12:06.623
...as a human being...

03:12:07.529 --> 03:12:09.793
...in this society...

03:12:11.032 --> 03:12:12.863
...on this earth...

03:12:14.369 --> 03:12:16.200
...in this day...

03:12:16.805 --> 03:12:19.433
...which we intend to bring...

03:12:19.641 --> 03:12:20.972
...into existence--"

03:12:21.176 --> 03:12:24.009
--by any means necessary!
