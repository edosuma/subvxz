WEBVTT

00:03.982 --> 00:06.072
Retesting evasive driving techniques.

00:06.279 --> 00:07.585
Third time's the charm, Otto.

00:08.423 --> 00:09.423
You can do it.

00:21.753 --> 00:22.963
Give me a 180, Otto.

00:26.855 --> 00:28.999
Yes! Didn't touch a
single cone on that run.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.048
I would call that a pass, baby.

00:31.172 --> 00:32.171
Phase two.

00:32.877 --> 00:34.218
This one's for you, Torsten.

00:34.559 --> 00:35.559
Go for it, Otto.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Make me proud.

00:39.183 --> 00:40.694
Avoiding civilian casualties

00:40.718 --> 00:42.011
during high-speed egress.

00:49.203 --> 00:50.203
Oops.

00:51.172 --> 00:52.431
Sorry about that, Torsten.

00:55.561 --> 00:57.882
Need to recalibrate the
braking-to-surface algorithm.

00:58.102 --> 00:59.102
That was my fault, Otto.

00:59.675 --> 01:00.675
Not yours.

01:00.896 --> 01:01.896
Test concluded.

01:02.358 --> 01:03.480
Take me home, Otto.

01:15.857 --> 01:16.857
Ooh...

01:16.979 --> 01:18.530
Still a few bugs to work out,

01:18.645 --> 01:20.699
but Otto and I are
both feeling much better

01:20.723 --> 01:22.148
about the drive-off next week.

01:22.632 --> 01:25.431
Oh, note for Jamie-fuel
pressuge is fluctuating.

01:30.242 --> 01:33.399
Malfunction in the
electrical system at 0638.

01:33.696 --> 01:35.302
Initiating software shutdown.

01:41.462 --> 01:42.529
Exhaust in the cabin.

01:43.222 --> 01:44.330
Otto's core is frozen.

01:44.564 --> 01:45.719
I'm hitting the kill switch.

01:50.563 --> 01:52.334
Come on... Come on!

01:53.005 --> 01:54.863
I'm trapped in the ca...

02:51.805 --> 02:52.805
Lights, please.

02:53.305 --> 02:54.609
From the video presentation,

02:54.633 --> 02:56.483
it's clear that sexual harassment

02:56.507 --> 02:58.641
can take many forms in the workplace.

02:59.081 --> 02:59.916
A coworker with

03:00.103 --> 03:02.446
elevator eyes looking you up and down,

03:02.842 --> 03:05.597
a coworker shows you a cartoon or

03:05.684 --> 03:07.587
photo of a sexual nature.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.500
If you're lucky.

03:08.643 --> 03:11.310
A coworker's hand accidentally

03:11.937 --> 03:13.521
brushes up against your body.

03:13.576 --> 03:14.934
If you're really lucky.

03:15.088 --> 03:15.989
Physical contact

03:16.013 --> 03:18.585
can be divided into three categories.

03:19.377 --> 03:21.741
Green light includes normal behavior.

03:22.060 --> 03:23.303
Yellow light includes

03:23.633 --> 03:26.696
borderline behaviors such
as hugging someone or...

03:28.258 --> 03:28.665
Yep?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.050
What's wrong with hugging people?

03:30.094 --> 03:31.392
I hug people all the time.

03:31.689 --> 03:32.711
You may see it as friendly,

03:32.735 --> 03:34.433
but your coworkers
may find it offensive.

03:35.659 --> 03:37.408
You guys get offended when I hug you?

03:37.463 --> 03:38.793
No. No. No.

03:38.863 --> 03:40.133
Of course not, Abby.

03:40.811 --> 03:43.132
I'm hugging you all
in my mind right now.

03:43.209 --> 03:44.313
D.O.D. policy

03:44.337 --> 03:46.360
is very clear about this point, Miss.

03:46.698 --> 03:48.043
You must first ask permission

03:48.067 --> 03:49.427
before making physical contact

03:49.451 --> 03:50.077
with a coworker.

03:50.451 --> 03:52.123
Like, every time?

03:52.904 --> 03:53.481
Yes.

03:53.514 --> 03:55.509
And finally, there's red light behavior,

03:55.533 --> 03:57.171
such as deliberate,

03:57.391 --> 03:59.046
unwelcomed touching.

04:03.384 --> 04:04.561
Another question?

04:04.990 --> 04:05.408
Yeah,

04:05.897 --> 04:08.217
what if you slap someone in
the back of the head like this?

04:09.031 --> 04:11.528
Would that be considered
inappropriate behavior?

04:11.583 --> 04:12.583
Absolutely.

04:12.782 --> 04:14.622
Are you saying that this
has actually happened?

04:18.385 --> 04:19.947
No, I was just wondering, that's all.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.661
Yes?

04:21.800 --> 04:24.819
Uh, yes, uh, what if part of your job...

04:24.951 --> 04:25.292
Gibbs.

04:25.545 --> 04:28.161
Includes... touching naked people

04:28.185 --> 04:30.543
- and...
- That's inappropriate at any time.

04:31.335 --> 04:32.335
Even if they're dead?

04:34.431 --> 04:36.306
Why are you touching dead, naked people?

04:36.812 --> 04:38.555
You see, I work in autopsy...

04:38.953 --> 04:40.723
Can we try to keep this discussion

04:40.747 --> 04:42.300
focused on the topic...

04:42.454 --> 04:43.454
Gear up.

04:44.011 --> 04:45.355
Navy lieutenant's been found dead

04:45.379 --> 04:46.923
in an R & D facility in Fairfax.

04:46.947 --> 04:48.150
Wait, I can't

04:48.210 --> 04:49.584
mark you as attending
unless you're here for...

04:49.608 --> 04:50.917
Uh, Ms. Taylor.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.993
I will take excellent notes for them.

04:57.804 --> 04:58.804
Okay...

05:01.335 --> 05:02.335
Ducky won't be here.

05:02.721 --> 05:04.321
He's got to take his
mom to the hospital.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.772
Is Victoria all right?

05:06.163 --> 05:08.476
Well, she cut herself
shaving, and for some reason,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.051
he thinks you can handle this, Palmer.

05:11.585 --> 05:13.862
Uh... what do you think, Agent Gibbs?

05:14.406 --> 05:16.076
Well, I don't know, Palmer.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.595
- You got me a T.O.D.?
- Yes.

05:18.112 --> 05:20.350
Uh, according to the
liver probe, she died...

05:20.768 --> 05:22.825
two hours and 18 minutes ago.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.051
Does it tell you how?

05:24.634 --> 05:25.903
Actually, the probe only

05:25.927 --> 05:28.302
tells you the difference between
ambient temperature and...

05:28.632 --> 05:30.302
But you already know all this.

05:30.866 --> 05:33.113
Tentatively, I'd say
she died from hypoxia,

05:33.137 --> 05:33.804
Agent Gibbs.

05:33.888 --> 05:35.504
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

05:35.570 --> 05:36.604
Yeah, most likely.

05:36.978 --> 05:38.941
In 68% of cases, it's accidental.

05:39.436 --> 05:42.233
And, uh, the other 29%
are self-inflicted.

05:42.257 --> 05:44.657
Well, I'm more concerned with
the three percent you left out.

05:44.726 --> 05:45.682
Palmer, he's talking about the ones

05:45.706 --> 05:47.233
deliberately murdered this way.

05:47.618 --> 05:48.718
How'd she get on the floor.

05:48.894 --> 05:50.548
Coworker found her
in the passenger seat,

05:50.572 --> 05:53.610
in there, doors still closed
and the engine running.

05:53.634 --> 05:55.706
He drove it out, attempted CPR.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.930
Tony's taking a statement now.

05:57.401 --> 05:58.809
What kind of vehicle is this?

05:59.715 --> 06:01.628
It is a second generation

06:01.652 --> 06:04.263
- fully autonomous AI.
- Operated vehicle, boss.

06:04.643 --> 06:06.719
Well, yeah. Yeah, I can see that, McGee.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.151
I mean, other than the obvious.

06:08.217 --> 06:08.492
Wait,

06:08.569 --> 06:10.333
you actually understood that?

06:10.747 --> 06:11.827
You know what it does then?

06:12.792 --> 06:15.178
Yeah, your basic second generation...

06:15.387 --> 06:16.387
AI...

06:16.696 --> 06:18.357
autonomous stuff.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.181
Where the hell does the driver sit?

06:24.310 --> 06:26.147
That's the point. There isn't one.

06:26.455 --> 06:27.455
It drives itself.

06:27.665 --> 06:30.337
Boss, "AI" stands for
artificial intelligence.

06:31.734 --> 06:32.734
It's a robot.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.883
All I'm saying, Agent DiNozzo

06:35.907 --> 06:38.309
is our entire team is under a tremendous

06:38.333 --> 06:39.388
amount of stress.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.839
We're competing against dozens of teams.

06:41.863 --> 06:43.337
Three and a half years of work,

06:43.425 --> 06:46.619
and it all comes down to a
single proof of concept test.

06:46.894 --> 06:47.927
Robot car race.

06:47.951 --> 06:50.467
In crude terms, yes.

06:50.491 --> 06:51.571
What do you get if you win?

06:51.663 --> 06:53.245
Recognition in my field.

06:54.668 --> 06:56.226
What about one of
those cool trophies like

06:56.250 --> 06:57.656
they hand out at NASCAR?

06:58.326 --> 06:59.018
I wouldn't know.

06:59.042 --> 07:01.318
I'm a scientist, not a redneck.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.638
It is the fastest-growing
sport in the country.

07:03.913 --> 07:04.925
I rest my case.

07:05.409 --> 07:06.303
In my opinion,

07:06.327 --> 07:07.592
it's clear what happened here.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.511
When I found Seabrook, she was...

07:09.786 --> 07:11.433
sitting in Otto with the diagnostic

07:11.469 --> 07:12.469
bay doors closed

07:12.496 --> 07:13.662
and the engine running.

07:14.190 --> 07:15.190
What's that tell you?

07:16.071 --> 07:17.336
You think she killed herself?

07:17.963 --> 07:18.963
I do.

07:19.854 --> 07:22.294
What about an accident or a malfunction?

07:22.318 --> 07:24.093
All she had to do to shut Otto down

07:24.117 --> 07:25.456
was to flick the kill switch.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.442
It was right in front
of her on the dashboard.

07:28.466 --> 07:29.560
Look, obviously...

07:30.100 --> 07:32.117
she couldn't face her own faults and

07:32.280 --> 07:33.463
missed deadlines, so...

07:34.333 --> 07:35.565
she took the coward's way out.

07:35.719 --> 07:37.599
- That's enough, Torsten.
- She's dead, Russell.

07:38.094 --> 07:38.797
There's no need for you

07:38.821 --> 07:41.102
to continue this
charade of defending her.

07:43.621 --> 07:44.621
I'm Dr. Pike.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.116
Project leader.

07:46.793 --> 07:48.195
Where is Lieutenant Seabrook?

07:51.626 --> 07:52.737
Could you stop?

07:57.279 --> 07:58.279
Can I...

07:58.984 --> 07:59.984
Can I see her?

08:09.299 --> 08:10.299
Roni...

08:12.963 --> 08:13.963
What have you done?

08:17.847 --> 08:19.695
Ziva, you have really got to see this.

08:20.157 --> 08:21.317
See what, McGee?

08:21.548 --> 08:23.412
It's an Atlas-Seven CPU.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.544
It's the same one developed
for the Martian rovers.

08:25.601 --> 08:27.432
And how does this pertain to the case?

08:27.553 --> 08:29.313
Well, it doesn't. I just
thought it was cool.

08:29.406 --> 08:30.489
See, the thing about...

08:33.090 --> 08:34.289
That better be your handcuffs.

08:34.398 --> 08:36.884
I believe this is a classic
yellow light situation.

08:38.495 --> 08:40.530
Stop moving, McGee. My hand's stuck.

08:40.876 --> 08:42.356
It's not the only thing that's stuck.

08:42.493 --> 08:43.802
Make that a red light situation.

08:45.946 --> 08:46.946
What are you doing?

08:47.431 --> 08:49.702
Investigating a dead Naval officer.

08:49.735 --> 08:53.183
That's a $22 million
piece of equipment, you...

08:55.327 --> 08:58.176
You people are jeopardizing
my entire project.

08:58.374 --> 08:59.952
We're doing our jobs. What'd you find?

09:00.964 --> 09:03.200
Ah, there's a USB cable,

09:03.224 --> 09:05.174
still attached to the
console in the passenger side.

09:05.198 --> 09:07.909
Also bagged a battery for
a laptop in the front seat.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.533
I removed the laptop.

09:09.872 --> 09:10.455
We'll need it.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.471
Absolutely not.

09:11.495 --> 09:13.705
It contains a backup copy of Otto's AI.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.593
Well, whatever that is,
we'll need that, too.

09:16.916 --> 09:18.621
That is Otto.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.382
Already got it covered, Tony.

09:23.575 --> 09:25.175
Tow truck should be here any minute now.

09:25.489 --> 09:27.837
This is our only prototype!

09:27.996 --> 09:30.581
You people... you people are...

09:30.713 --> 09:31.284
you're...

09:31.592 --> 09:35.964
We're cops, Federal
agents, police officers?

09:36.734 --> 09:38.163
Maybe if you sound it out, it's easier.

09:38.187 --> 09:38.703
You know,

09:38.745 --> 09:41.215
english as a third language
is always the trickiest one.

09:41.391 --> 09:43.987
I'll take the laptop now, please.

09:49.493 --> 09:52.246
I've known Roni for almost
ten years, Agent Gibbs.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.433
She was one of my
brightest students at MIT.

09:56.915 --> 09:58.463
An exceptional mind.

09:58.751 --> 10:00.693
Light-years ahead of her peers

10:00.786 --> 10:03.433
when it came to the field
of artificial intelligence.

10:03.568 --> 10:05.130
Machines that can think.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.438
Yes.

10:06.977 --> 10:07.494
So...

10:07.989 --> 10:09.595
that Humvee can think?

10:10.145 --> 10:11.393
Only about driving.

10:11.866 --> 10:14.273
An easy task for you or
me, but for a machine,

10:14.297 --> 10:17.101
it takes millions of
calculations a second and complex

10:17.321 --> 10:18.454
reasoning skills.

10:19.603 --> 10:20.475
According to the Navy,

10:20.499 --> 10:23.963
your thinking car is a joint
project with them and Azeon.

10:24.508 --> 10:27.356
They've been very good to us
as far as R & D resources go.

10:27.895 --> 10:28.895
Meaning money.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.493
And Lieutenant Seabrook's time.

10:31.849 --> 10:33.106
Gonna need your security tapes

10:33.130 --> 10:35.121
and access logs that you keep, Doctor.

10:37.282 --> 10:40.119
She wasn't even supposed
to be here this morning,

10:40.143 --> 10:41.143
agent Gibbs.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.914
She worked late last night. I... I...

10:45.371 --> 10:46.702
I gave her the morning off.

10:47.334 --> 10:48.334
She didn't take it.

10:49.824 --> 10:51.243
She died in your garage

10:52.464 --> 10:53.916
at zero-six-forty this morning.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.474
She must have come in to run a test.

10:58.211 --> 10:59.211
She's a...

11:01.125 --> 11:02.956
was a perfectionist.

11:04.287 --> 11:05.359
Never satisfied.

11:08.064 --> 11:10.253
Traits I'm afraid I encouraged her in.

11:10.924 --> 11:12.495
Sitting in a running vehicle

11:12.519 --> 11:15.290
inside an enclosed space
is not a bright idea.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.490
Trust me, Agent Gibbs...

11:18.309 --> 11:20.267
Roni was not the type to kill herself.

11:21.064 --> 11:22.340
What type was she, Doctor?

11:23.393 --> 11:24.393
Driven.

11:27.140 --> 11:30.033
Lieutenant Seabrook's Naval
career was most unusual.

11:30.170 --> 11:31.770
No deployments and,
as far as I can tell,

11:31.794 --> 11:33.178
she never set foot on a ship.

11:33.365 --> 11:34.705
Well, she was an egghead.

11:34.729 --> 11:36.249
They don't recruit them to fight wars.

11:36.323 --> 11:38.358
No. Just to build the
machines for fighting them.

11:38.435 --> 11:39.205
Maybe she had enough.

11:39.447 --> 11:40.447
Enough of what?

11:40.486 --> 11:42.386
You'd be surprised how
many weapon designers

11:42.410 --> 11:43.438
take their own lives.

11:43.472 --> 11:44.742
I might have a better motive.

11:45.424 --> 11:48.133
Azeon had everything leveraged on Otto.

11:48.432 --> 11:50.833
It fails the drive-off,
the company goes bankrupt.

11:51.247 --> 11:52.247
Sabotage.

11:52.391 --> 11:53.511
Someone wanted them to fail.

11:54.085 --> 11:55.085
Not bad, McGee.

11:55.261 --> 11:56.415
I got one better than better.

11:56.439 --> 11:59.133
Curious to know what follows
red light behavior, Ziva?

11:59.254 --> 12:01.497
A potential pregnancy?

12:01.552 --> 12:03.257
It's a good guess, but not in this case.

12:04.461 --> 12:05.461
Check this out.

12:06.144 --> 12:08.547
Ran the security footage
taken from the lab.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.697
Zero-one-fifteen.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.413
Last two people present
were our lieutenant

12:12.437 --> 12:13.437
and this guy.

12:13.573 --> 12:16.036
Azeon's chief mechanic, Jamie Jones.

12:16.388 --> 12:17.444
Hold on to your socks.

12:17.796 --> 12:18.796
Gets a little steamy.

12:22.882 --> 12:25.170
What about the video from
this morning, when she died?

12:25.202 --> 12:26.517
Oh, yeah!

12:27.386 --> 12:28.667
Why didn't I think of that?!

12:29.717 --> 12:30.784
'Cause someone erased it.

12:31.746 --> 12:33.759
The last image taken
from any camera stops

12:33.793 --> 12:35.519
at zero-five-thirty-seven
this morning.

12:36.195 --> 12:37.235
And then nothing but snow.

12:38.895 --> 12:39.895
She was murdered.

12:51.983 --> 12:54.128
Did you find my bag, Mr. Palmer?

12:54.260 --> 12:55.580
In the trunk of your car, Doctor.

12:56.366 --> 12:57.366
Ah, thank you.

12:57.581 --> 13:00.441
I'm sorry if I seem
a bit flustered today.

13:00.787 --> 13:02.272
Oh, that's understandable, Doctor.

13:02.536 --> 13:03.896
Where did your mother cut herself?

13:04.598 --> 13:07.137
Well, let's just say
that a woman in her 90s

13:07.161 --> 13:09.596
should not be using
a straight-edged razor

13:09.772 --> 13:12.115
when grooming, and leave it at that.

13:12.742 --> 13:15.433
Are you hiding a secret
from me, Mr. Palmer?

13:17.069 --> 13:18.805
Well, it's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

13:18.829 --> 13:20.789
I've been thinking of
doing the same thing myself.

13:21.265 --> 13:22.918
You are? Yes, only in my case,

13:22.942 --> 13:24.619
I have to be careful of heart strain

13:24.643 --> 13:26.100
and muscle fatigue.

13:26.247 --> 13:27.935
How long have you been pumping?

13:29.007 --> 13:31.614
I, I wouldn't call it pumping, Doctor.

13:31.691 --> 13:33.453
Well, whatever they call it these days,

13:33.477 --> 13:34.484
I'm impressed with you.

13:35.072 --> 13:35.622
Really?

13:35.699 --> 13:37.767
Yes, you've certainly
got yourself in shape.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.785
Have you joined a gym?

13:40.742 --> 13:41.742
A gym?

13:41.836 --> 13:44.723
Yes, yes, yes, I have.
A, uh, few months ago.

13:45.174 --> 13:46.174
What have we got, Duck?

13:47.362 --> 13:50.332
Ah, Mr. Palmer's initial
assumption was correct.

13:50.750 --> 13:54.016
Lieutenant Seabrook died of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

13:55.523 --> 13:56.533
Tell me something I don't know.

13:56.557 --> 13:58.976
The levels of C.O. in her blood

13:59.185 --> 14:01.362
five times the fatal dose, yes.

14:01.593 --> 14:02.735
She was probably rendered

14:02.759 --> 14:04.750
unconscious in less than 30 seconds.

14:05.355 --> 14:06.662
Not possible, unless she was...

14:06.686 --> 14:08.190
She was breathing in the

14:08.214 --> 14:10.066
exhaust fumes directly
from the tailpipe.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.739
Or someone pumped it into the vehicle.

14:11.794 --> 14:14.477
Which makes sense, in
light of what else I found.

14:14.796 --> 14:17.291
Evidence of assault. Look at her wrists.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.761
They're bruised.

14:19.102 --> 14:20.411
She was restrained.

14:20.477 --> 14:23.253
And I also found what appear to be

14:23.319 --> 14:25.948
bite marks on her inner thighs and back.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.300
Run a rape kit.

14:27.361 --> 14:30.193
I did. That's when I found this.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.332
An intrauterine device.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.737
More commonly known as an I.U.D.

14:36.825 --> 14:38.297
Is it just me, or has
anyone else wondered

14:38.321 --> 14:39.961
how they get those
little things in there?

14:42.844 --> 14:43.838
That, that probably sounded

14:43.862 --> 14:45.158
a lot more inappropriate than I meant.

14:45.182 --> 14:46.153
Do you think, Palmer?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.534
As I was saying,

14:47.600 --> 14:48.776
when I ran the rape kit,

14:48.800 --> 14:51.197
I found fresh male genetic material.

14:51.505 --> 14:53.286
From last night or early this morning.

14:53.429 --> 14:55.398
Abby's running the samples now.

14:55.596 --> 14:56.657
I also found

14:56.800 --> 14:58.558
traces of engine oil

14:58.582 --> 15:00.395
and a particular kind of lotion

15:00.419 --> 15:01.925
on her hair and skin.

15:02.123 --> 15:03.894
The main ingredient was pumice.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.300
Grease-monkey soap.

15:05.324 --> 15:07.039
Yeah. Except,

15:07.512 --> 15:10.234
her nails and hands are clean.

15:10.663 --> 15:13.971
The skin is soft, no
calluses to speak of.

15:13.995 --> 15:14.995
Not her soap.

15:15.304 --> 15:17.058
She certainly wasn't a regular user.

15:18.455 --> 15:19.455
Thanks, Duck.

15:21.215 --> 15:22.252
Did you learn nothing

15:22.276 --> 15:24.256
in that class this morning, Mr. Palmer?

15:26.428 --> 15:28.303
Jamie Jones was arrested in 1998

15:28.336 --> 15:30.617
for assault and battery
on his girlfriend and...

15:30.641 --> 15:33.829
she dropped the charges and
married him six months later.

15:33.862 --> 15:35.380
There's no accounting for taste.

15:35.787 --> 15:36.985
Look at Britney and K-Fed.

15:37.009 --> 15:39.614
At least she was smart
enough to ask for a divorce.

15:39.713 --> 15:41.011
So was Jones' wife.

15:41.324 --> 15:42.853
Divorced three years ago.

15:43.425 --> 15:44.987
Ooh, and there's a restraining order.

15:45.047 --> 15:45.696
Shocking.

15:45.784 --> 15:46.784
Not on him.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.396
He got it against his ex-wife.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.194
Lieutenant Seabrook wasn't
alone at Azeon last night, boss.

15:51.502 --> 15:52.613
She was with a mechanic.

15:53.603 --> 15:55.759
Yeah. The Azeon security
cameras caught it.

15:55.836 --> 15:57.039
And there was evidence she was...

15:57.063 --> 15:58.063
Sexually assaulted.

15:58.426 --> 15:59.506
Ducky thinks she was raped.

15:59.839 --> 16:00.950
Yeah, check this out.

16:11.942 --> 16:12.943
You get a warrant yet?

16:13.339 --> 16:15.109
Yeah. Right here. Name's Jamie Jones.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.112
Ziva and I were gonna pick him up.

16:16.139 --> 16:16.675
Not anymore.

16:16.699 --> 16:18.300
You're processing the
Lieutenant's apartment.

16:18.324 --> 16:19.185
Boss, what about me?

16:19.328 --> 16:20.328
You get with Abby.

16:20.538 --> 16:22.538
The C.O. levels in that
vehicle were off the charts.

16:22.562 --> 16:24.113
You find out how he did it.

16:27.550 --> 16:28.550
Letting me drive?

16:28.699 --> 16:29.627
No, I'm meeting you there.

16:29.651 --> 16:31.905
I need to drop something
off at the hospital.

16:32.521 --> 16:32.906
What?

16:33.428 --> 16:35.430
A stool sample. Would
you like to see it?

16:35.826 --> 16:37.746
You want me to stab you
in the eye with my knife?

16:45.142 --> 16:45.538
Abby?

16:46.154 --> 16:47.457
Over here.

16:49.393 --> 16:50.393
Over where?

16:50.481 --> 16:51.603
Over down here.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.281
I'm trying to decide if
this is a yellow light

16:55.305 --> 16:56.844
or a red light situation.

16:58.361 --> 17:01.176
You only wish I was still
sexually harassing you.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.821
So, uh, Gibbs wants us to
figure out how so much CO

17:05.041 --> 17:06.482
got pumped into the vehicle's cabin.

17:06.604 --> 17:08.770
Okay, first of all, McGee, his name...

17:09.056 --> 17:09.963
is Otto.

17:10.035 --> 17:12.267
O- T-T-O. It's a palindrome.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.290
And second...

17:13.554 --> 17:17.325
he is so much more than a vehicle.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.174
I've never seen programming like this.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.517
It's complex, elegant,

17:21.583 --> 17:24.205
visionary. It's way out of my league.

17:24.266 --> 17:24.748
You?

17:24.771 --> 17:26.608
I got lost about 50 lines in.

17:26.807 --> 17:28.792
Seabrook was operating at
a whole different level.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.485
If they used the A.I. to sabotage

17:31.509 --> 17:32.826
or redirect the exhaust into

17:32.850 --> 17:34.137
the ventilation system,

17:34.835 --> 17:36.859
that could take us months to track.

17:37.343 --> 17:38.543
Make sure you tell Gibbs that.

17:38.701 --> 17:39.701
I did.

17:39.955 --> 17:41.835
I told him we needed help
from the Azeon people.

17:42.033 --> 17:44.112
How? Right now they're all suspects.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.662
That's what he said.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.267
Great.

17:47.345 --> 17:48.945
Well, how long did he give us this time?

17:49.473 --> 17:50.473
Today.

17:51.326 --> 17:52.987
This is completely unacceptable.

17:53.394 --> 17:54.641
When do we get our vehicle back?

17:54.665 --> 17:55.665
When we're done with it.

17:55.973 --> 17:56.798
Doing what?

17:56.924 --> 17:59.399
Figuring out how it was used
to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.274
Are all NCIS agents this stupid.

18:02.395 --> 18:03.395
Mr. Engler,

18:04.122 --> 18:05.189
insulting our guest

18:05.266 --> 18:06.998
won't bring Otto back here any sooner.

18:08.428 --> 18:09.428
Of course.

18:09.901 --> 18:10.901
My apologies.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.387
How long will it take
for you to figure out.

18:13.411 --> 18:15.169
Roni killed herself, Agent Gibbs?

18:15.257 --> 18:16.301
Who said she killed herself?

18:16.325 --> 18:18.793
She was the only one
down here this morning!

18:19.453 --> 18:20.453
You mean except for you.

18:21.070 --> 18:22.070
Torsten...

18:22.879 --> 18:23.879
take a break.

18:24.226 --> 18:25.226
I'll handle this.

18:25.925 --> 18:26.965
Well, you better, Russell.

18:27.091 --> 18:29.186
He's jeopardizing the entire
future of this company.

18:33.464 --> 18:35.845
What he was trying to
say was that this...

18:36.202 --> 18:37.764
proof-of-concept test

18:37.885 --> 18:40.343
is make-or-break time
for us, agent Gibbs.

18:40.464 --> 18:41.464
Reschedule it.

18:41.542 --> 18:42.542
I tried.

18:42.774 --> 18:45.252
The D.O.D. won't budge on the dates.

18:45.276 --> 18:47.948
Dozens of teams are flying
in from all over the world.

18:48.608 --> 18:50.889
Then you better help me find
Lieutenant Seabrook's killer.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.208
Where's your chief mechanic?

18:52.897 --> 18:53.897
Jamie?

18:54.663 --> 18:56.708
No. No, not possible.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.417
He got along very well with Roni.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.617
They were very good friends.

19:00.123 --> 19:02.465
He sexually assaulted her
in his garage last night.

19:09.828 --> 19:11.219
That's definitely yellow light.

19:11.263 --> 19:13.023
Cytology tests take 72 hours, but...

19:13.166 --> 19:15.249
Dr. House gets his results
back in ten minutes.

19:15.273 --> 19:16.093
It's ridiculous.

19:16.117 --> 19:17.186
In the entertainment
world, they call that

19:17.210 --> 19:18.903
"suspension of disbelief," actually.

19:18.963 --> 19:19.963
Tony!

19:21.700 --> 19:22.700
What are you doing here?

19:22.767 --> 19:24.431
Oh, well, I was in the area,

19:24.455 --> 19:27.232
and I thought I would, uh, drop this off.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.584
You found it.

19:28.838 --> 19:29.838
Yes, I did.

19:30.130 --> 19:30.724
Thank you.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.044
Uh, who's the guy molesting your neck...

19:33.242 --> 19:34.606
- over there.
- Oh.

19:34.748 --> 19:35.969
Just... curious.

19:36.266 --> 19:38.180
Am I detecting a little
bit of jealousy here?

19:39.989 --> 19:40.989
Me?

19:41.595 --> 19:42.728
Jealous? Yeah.

19:43.096 --> 19:44.096
Who was he?

19:44.350 --> 19:44.933
He's gay.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.533
Okay. Good.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.524
What's next, insisting that I...

19:49.832 --> 19:51.075
can't see other people?

19:51.339 --> 19:52.670
Oh, no, that would...

19:53.253 --> 19:54.275
that would just be cruel.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.872
You're the one who was too
busy to see me last night.

19:57.157 --> 19:58.597
Yeah, and I'll make it up to you.

19:59.268 --> 20:00.268
When?

20:00.742 --> 20:01.742
Tomorrow.

20:02.892 --> 20:03.892
I promise.

20:04.597 --> 20:05.597
Promise?

20:08.798 --> 20:10.408
What's that, marking your territory?

20:10.432 --> 20:11.597
Oh, just a reminder.

20:11.926 --> 20:13.526
Just until you make
good on your promise.

20:36.376 --> 20:36.958
Looks like she did

20:36.982 --> 20:39.225
a Trading Spaces with John Nash.

20:39.632 --> 20:40.819
Russell Crowe played him in.

20:40.843 --> 20:42.440
A Beautiful Mind, that Ron Howard movie

20:42.464 --> 20:43.704
about the insane mathematician?

20:45.104 --> 20:46.903
What kind of tests are you getting done?

20:47.473 --> 20:48.513
Why, you worried about me?

20:48.628 --> 20:49.793
You're keeping a paper bag filled

20:49.817 --> 20:51.680
with crap in your
desk, what do you think?

20:53.885 --> 20:55.605
I think you should go
and check the bedroom.

20:56.151 --> 20:57.151
That is...

20:58.939 --> 21:00.459
unless you want me to come with you...

21:00.588 --> 21:01.588
and help.

21:04.157 --> 21:05.157
What?

21:06.928 --> 21:09.304
Just wondering if offering
to take me to a bedroom

21:09.337 --> 21:11.894
constitutes sexual harassment.

21:12.763 --> 21:14.890
Well, if you have to ask, then it's not

21:14.946 --> 21:16.266
- harassment.
- Tony! Get in here!

21:18.299 --> 21:19.883
I just found Jamie Jones.

21:24.986 --> 21:25.986
Untie me!

21:30.227 --> 21:31.227
What do you think, Tony?

21:31.827 --> 21:34.500
Well, you saw the video of him
assaulting Lieutenant Seabrook.

21:34.665 --> 21:35.967
Doesn't explain how he ended up

21:35.991 --> 21:38.393
tied to her bedposts with
a ball gag in his mouth.

21:38.822 --> 21:40.961
Well, have you ever heard of accomplices?

21:44.601 --> 21:45.601
Oh.

21:46.834 --> 21:47.241
Tony.

21:47.763 --> 21:49.043
Am I catching you at a bad time?

21:49.578 --> 21:51.029
Uh, what can I do for you?

21:51.557 --> 21:53.052
Tomorrow night, I was thinking sushi.

21:53.076 --> 21:54.846
There's a great new place in Georgetown.

21:55.401 --> 21:55.769
Okay.

21:56.396 --> 21:57.859
Well, don't sound so excited.

21:58.596 --> 21:59.596
I'm at work.

22:00.058 --> 22:01.257
But, right, got it.

22:01.961 --> 22:02.961
Okay.

22:07.011 --> 22:09.603
What part of inappropriate
touching don't you understand?

22:11.703 --> 22:12.946
Uni Hospital?

22:13.342 --> 22:14.783
Test results came back already?

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
I'm pregnant.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.902
McGee's gonna be very proud.

22:21.667 --> 22:22.667
What are you looking at?

22:23.361 --> 22:24.481
Keep an eye on the jumpsuit.

22:28.909 --> 22:31.769
This Seabrook's got a
bunch of MP3 files on here.

22:31.813 --> 22:33.952
All created over the last 24 hours.

22:34.106 --> 22:35.893
You think she was illegally downloading?

22:36.003 --> 22:39.247
No. They were recorded with
the laptop's microphone.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.327
I think she was making
verbal observations

22:41.351 --> 22:42.624
while running her tests.

22:44.454 --> 22:46.103
I'm gonna line up the time-stamps.

22:46.127 --> 22:48.167
She might have made a
recording while she was dying.

22:48.562 --> 22:50.729
So, she was in the passenger seat.

22:51.565 --> 22:52.565
Probably...

22:53.750 --> 22:55.169
buckled her seat belt.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.879
Now, if she was tied to something,

22:58.903 --> 23:00.264
what would she be tied to?

23:07.262 --> 23:08.262
McGee!

23:08.361 --> 23:09.361
McGee!

23:09.520 --> 23:10.520
McGee!

23:14.714 --> 23:15.714
McGee!

23:18.313 --> 23:19.636
McGee, help me!

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
McGee!

23:37.743 --> 23:38.743
McGee!

23:39.602 --> 23:40.602
Help!

23:42.745 --> 23:44.707
It won't open. The kill switch.

23:50.354 --> 23:51.354
Cover your face!

23:59.942 --> 24:01.002
Permission to hug you.

24:01.505 --> 24:02.802
You never have to ask, Abby.

24:03.368 --> 24:03.869
What happened?

24:03.958 --> 24:04.958
Get the chair.

24:05.287 --> 24:06.777
I almost bought the farm, McGee.

24:08.237 --> 24:10.806
I even saw that old lady
telling me to run to the light.

24:11.005 --> 24:13.225
Boss, my back was only
turned for a few seconds.

24:13.249 --> 24:14.889
A few mores seconds, McGee,
she'd be dead.

24:15.015 --> 24:15.503
You okay?

24:15.846 --> 24:17.464
Yeah, I'm really lightheaded.

24:17.894 --> 24:18.337
Boss?

24:18.908 --> 24:19.873
Evidence cage called in an...

24:19.897 --> 24:21.113
- emergency alert...?
- It was me, DiNozzo.

24:21.137 --> 24:21.715
Stand down.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.288
You attacked the car?

24:23.352 --> 24:24.498
The car tried to kill Abby.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.060
I think there was a short.

24:27.956 --> 24:29.476
When I tried to unbuckle my seat belt,

24:29.949 --> 24:31.973
it pinned me back and the windows shut

24:32.222 --> 24:33.388
and the engines started.

24:33.879 --> 24:35.298
It triggered all the doors

24:35.362 --> 24:36.453
in the car to lock.

24:36.989 --> 24:39.649
And then the whole cabin
filled up with exhaust.

24:40.201 --> 24:41.346
A few minutes more, I would've been

24:41.370 --> 24:43.200
singing hymns with my angels right how.

24:43.585 --> 24:45.100
Abby, I'd have noticed before then.

24:46.381 --> 24:47.851
Then I would've hugged you, McGee.

24:48.397 --> 24:50.455
So Lieutenant Seabrook was
killed by a malfunction?

24:51.521 --> 24:52.651
Too many variables.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.081
It was deliberate.

24:54.288 --> 24:56.221
The lieutenant was set
up to look like suicide.

24:56.433 --> 24:58.793
I think it's time you had a
heart-to-heart with Jones, boss.

24:59.492 --> 25:00.492
How'd he do it?

25:01.406 --> 25:03.097
It's not a damn quiz, McGee!

25:03.121 --> 25:04.121
Find out!

25:04.638 --> 25:05.638
On it.

25:05.717 --> 25:06.717
What'd you say to Jones?

25:06.812 --> 25:08.852
Nothing. He's been asking
about Lieutenant Seabrook.

25:09.213 --> 25:10.413
Acting like she's still alive.

25:12.247 --> 25:13.607
Come on, Ducky's checking you out.

25:13.695 --> 25:14.388
I'm fine, I just...

25:14.412 --> 25:15.794
It's not a request, Abby.

25:25.268 --> 25:26.268
This is not good.

25:28.251 --> 25:31.203
Look, this is all just a big
misunderstanding, Agent Gibbs.

25:32.187 --> 25:34.161
All you have to do is
call one phone number, man.

25:38.839 --> 25:39.839
Lawyer?

25:39.911 --> 25:40.354
No.

25:40.662 --> 25:41.662
Roni.

25:42.447 --> 25:44.466
Look, I know what it must
have looked like back

25:44.490 --> 25:45.490
at her apartment but...

25:47.770 --> 25:49.536
Lieutenant Seabrook's
your girlfriend now?

25:50.974 --> 25:51.974
Yeah.

25:52.059 --> 25:53.519
Look, we worked together
for a few years, we started

25:53.543 --> 25:54.775
dating maybe six months back.

25:54.846 --> 25:55.282
Dating?

25:55.687 --> 25:56.687
Yeah.

26:06.586 --> 26:07.586
What's that look like?

26:08.997 --> 26:10.256
It's a stupid game, man.

26:11.527 --> 26:12.567
Only when we're alone.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.208
You like games, Jones?

26:17.806 --> 26:19.206
We're just role playing, all right?

26:19.450 --> 26:20.978
It's not like we're freaks.

26:23.258 --> 26:24.641
Am I going to lose my security clearance

26:24.665 --> 26:25.665
- over this...?
- Hey...

26:25.775 --> 26:27.534
you almost killed one
of my people today!

26:27.826 --> 26:28.284
What?

26:28.308 --> 26:30.485
That damn Humvee you used
to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.395
Roni... What the hell
are you talking about?

26:32.433 --> 26:34.690
Roni is downstairs, Jones!

26:35.287 --> 26:36.459
On a steel slab!

26:39.233 --> 26:40.513
This is one of her jokes, right?

26:44.873 --> 26:45.952
Is she behind the glass?

26:46.405 --> 26:46.720
Huh?

26:47.223 --> 26:48.373
Because if you are, Roni,

26:48.463 --> 26:49.483
this isn't funny!

27:03.508 --> 27:04.508
Roni...

27:08.679 --> 27:09.810
tell me it's not real.

27:20.192 --> 27:21.192
I did it, Abby.

27:22.878 --> 27:23.912
I know how they got in.

27:30.638 --> 27:31.929
How'd you know I was here?

27:34.911 --> 27:35.911
I didn't.

27:40.506 --> 27:41.579
Abby, I'm sorry for...

27:41.720 --> 27:42.720
I know.

27:52.937 --> 27:55.057
Thought you were supposed
to ask for permission first.

27:56.995 --> 27:58.257
Never with you, Tim.

28:04.482 --> 28:05.512
He's telling the truth.

28:05.788 --> 28:07.516
Just a quick test run

28:07.540 --> 28:09.253
and she's coming right back to him.

28:11.683 --> 28:12.683
Yeah. Gibbs.

28:14.104 --> 28:15.104
Right with you, Abs.

28:18.478 --> 28:20.079
The reason that we couldn't
find how they hacked

28:20.103 --> 28:21.775
the AI program was they didn't.

28:22.424 --> 28:23.164
They snuck in

28:23.188 --> 28:24.671
before the system was even on-line.

28:25.429 --> 28:26.429
Makes sense.

28:26.456 --> 28:27.987
There were a series of commands inserted

28:28.011 --> 28:30.004
into the flash memory
of the BIOS at boot-up.

28:30.171 --> 28:31.852
They waited until the
conditions were met,

28:31.876 --> 28:33.899
and the, bam, killer car syndrome.

28:33.923 --> 28:35.755
Once executed, they purged from memory.

28:35.779 --> 28:37.313
The only trace left, an extra space

28:37.337 --> 28:38.897
on one of the mother board's bio chips.

28:39.699 --> 28:41.139
Figured it'd be something like that.

28:42.466 --> 28:43.466
Right.

28:43.692 --> 28:45.798
We know the program was flashed from a

28:45.822 --> 28:47.779
physical device that
was tied into the system.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.471
Memory stick. SD card.

28:49.503 --> 28:50.512
We just need to find it.

28:50.537 --> 28:52.055
And when we do, we'll
have the killer code

28:52.079 --> 28:53.166
and a clue to who wrote it.

28:55.112 --> 28:55.910
I think we lost him.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.600
We need to try it again but slower.

28:57.764 --> 28:59.079
So what you're saying, for example,

28:59.103 --> 29:00.910
is we need to find something this small

29:01.282 --> 29:02.389
in a Humvee jammed with

29:02.413 --> 29:04.181
$22 million worth of electronics.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.045
Pretty much.

29:08.502 --> 29:09.502
We're screwed.

29:11.039 --> 29:12.690
Now that is an excellent point.

29:16.623 --> 29:17.623
You wanted to see me?

29:18.205 --> 29:19.843
You have plans tonight, Tony.

29:20.074 --> 29:21.917
Actually no. Tomorrow, I'm going to...

29:21.981 --> 29:23.162
It wasn't a question.

29:24.424 --> 29:25.970
We've had these three under observation

29:25.994 --> 29:28.078
ever since you tagged
their bags at the airport.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.538
They made reservations
for dinner tonight here.

29:32.206 --> 29:33.872
The reservation is for four.

29:34.575 --> 29:36.175
I want to know who they're meeting with.

29:36.447 --> 29:37.031
Excellent.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.480
I've always wanted to try
the food at this place,

29:39.504 --> 29:41.449
but it's a little
outside of my price range.

29:42.235 --> 29:43.235
You won't be inside.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.248
We couldn't risk them
I.D.'ing you as the

29:45.272 --> 29:46.999
baggage handler from the airport.

29:47.812 --> 29:48.859
So what's the plan?

29:49.726 --> 29:52.567
We're going to take a more
covert approach on this one.

29:53.286 --> 29:56.359
Oh, I ever tell you
covert's my middle name?

29:57.948 --> 30:00.995
* In my perspective *

30:02.620 --> 30:06.437
* I see the people
from the big jet plane *

30:07.316 --> 30:10.418
* The woman looks Teutonic,
she drinks a vodka tonic *

30:10.668 --> 30:12.986
* And two bald men sit with her *

30:13.519 --> 30:14.858
* Waiting for a fourth *

30:15.211 --> 30:18.869
* They're not going to
order that main course *

30:18.893 --> 30:21.362
* Until that person come... *

30:22.893 --> 30:23.893
Hey...

30:24.071 --> 30:25.071
Everybody's a critic.

30:25.468 --> 30:26.468
Am-scray.

30:26.650 --> 30:27.650
Get out of here.

30:32.447 --> 30:34.606
Keep your eyes on the
prize, Tango Eight.

30:34.630 --> 30:36.601
I may even let you keep
the money you're making.

30:36.781 --> 30:40.968
* Sorry, I just do what I can... *

30:41.013 --> 30:43.291
You're not going to sing
the whole thing, are you?

30:43.315 --> 30:46.204
* I gotta do what I gotta do *

30:47.141 --> 30:49.485
* I'm just a man *

30:49.517 --> 30:51.716
* Oh, speaking of man *

30:52.056 --> 30:55.157
* Another man walks
through that front door *

30:55.369 --> 30:57.565
* Wearing a polka-dot scarf *

30:58.073 --> 31:00.618
* Will he join the table? I don't know *

31:00.875 --> 31:04.780
* Yes, he does and greets the
pretty lady, what do they say? *

31:05.123 --> 31:05.797
* Who knows *

31:06.035 --> 31:07.367
* He's sitting at the table

31:07.391 --> 31:09.830
* With the other people from the plane *

31:11.103 --> 31:12.741
Stay steady on the target, Tango 8.

31:12.765 --> 31:13.637
I want his photo.

31:13.721 --> 31:14.979
Isolate and freeze-frame.

31:15.230 --> 31:18.951
* They are having a conversation *

31:19.782 --> 31:22.126
* A heavy, heavy conversation *

31:22.671 --> 31:25.416
* That man
talk, a-talk, a-talk a lot *

31:25.448 --> 31:27.535
* Talk, a-talk, a-talk a lot *

31:28.418 --> 31:31.291
* Jenny, think I've been made *

31:32.094 --> 31:34.033
* Do you see what I see? *

31:34.104 --> 31:35.253
Relax, Tango 8.

31:35.535 --> 31:38.162
I'm sure he's just checking
his reflection in the glass.

31:41.486 --> 31:43.020
Hey, what was that movie

31:43.044 --> 31:44.797
where they took the whole car apart?

31:45.047 --> 31:46.145
I am not Tony.

31:46.575 --> 31:48.692
Come on. You know the one.
They were looking for heroin

31:48.716 --> 31:50.417
and they took apart that entire car?

31:50.642 --> 31:51.642
Still not Tony.

32:01.015 --> 32:02.132
Abby, I think I found it.

32:12.476 --> 32:13.758
That's it. That's the kill program.

32:13.782 --> 32:14.782
Yes!

32:15.079 --> 32:16.079
That's a good job.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.373
Now put it back together.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.272
As in "now."

32:22.313 --> 32:23.459
Gibbs, what's the rush?

32:23.741 --> 32:25.965
The Director just assured
the Secretary of The Navy

32:25.989 --> 32:27.979
we were handling this
thing with kid gloves.

32:28.003 --> 32:29.395
Well, we didn't get that memo

32:29.629 --> 32:29.892
'cause...

32:30.412 --> 32:30.688
you know...

32:31.119 --> 32:31.870
we're wearing latex.

32:32.030 --> 32:34.101
Well, they want a team
from Azeon to come by,

32:34.125 --> 32:35.885
check and make sure we
didn't break anything.

32:36.362 --> 32:37.362
When?

32:37.633 --> 32:38.633
Two hours.

32:39.328 --> 32:41.312
Boss, it took us ten
just to take it apart.

32:42.205 --> 32:43.645
Yeah, that's why I brought you help.

32:46.475 --> 32:48.833
And Roni would be in tears
if she saw Otto like this.

32:49.256 --> 32:50.559
Can you do it or not, Jones?

32:53.493 --> 32:54.493
Does he have to run?

32:54.903 --> 32:55.903
It'd be nice.

32:58.482 --> 32:59.482
You all right?

32:59.969 --> 33:00.969
Define "all right."

33:02.338 --> 33:04.733
Find out the results from
the medical tests yet?

33:08.386 --> 33:09.386
Not yet.

33:10.537 --> 33:12.001
Time's the Azeon team getting here?

33:12.173 --> 33:13.940
40 minutes ago.

33:14.173 --> 33:15.173
You fell asleep.

33:15.705 --> 33:17.745
Gibbs and Jenny are stalling
them in her office now.

33:18.687 --> 33:20.569
If you've discovered the
problem with the vehicle,

33:20.593 --> 33:21.789
we can fix it.

33:21.969 --> 33:22.687
Wasn't a problem.

33:22.986 --> 33:23.986
It was sabotage.

33:24.806 --> 33:25.806
By whom?

33:25.953 --> 33:28.048
An expert in artificial intelligence.

33:28.497 --> 33:29.803
Then it wasn't Jamie.

33:30.427 --> 33:32.478
It must be one of the companies
we're competing against.

33:32.502 --> 33:35.038
They, they know they can't
beat us in a fair fight.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.645
The winner of the drive-off

33:36.669 --> 33:38.702
gets the entire D.O.D. contract,

33:38.726 --> 33:40.644
Director Shepard, not just the Navy's.

33:41.033 --> 33:42.813
The Navy's banking on you, Doctor.

33:42.951 --> 33:45.173
It's why I've agreed to
the Secretary's request

33:45.197 --> 33:46.775
that you visually inspect Otto.

33:47.076 --> 33:48.076
When?

33:50.913 --> 33:52.281
Right how if you'd like.

33:52.644 --> 33:54.764
Agent Gibbs, would
you mind escorting us?

34:19.945 --> 34:20.945
Where is Otto?

34:22.871 --> 34:23.871
Gibbs?

34:35.320 --> 34:38.543
We have let a robot-killer Humvee loose

34:38.719 --> 34:40.777
on the streets of Washington.

34:40.801 --> 34:43.549
Uh, technically, Director,
it's a second-generation,

34:43.572 --> 34:45.291
- fully...
- I don't care what it's called!

34:45.409 --> 34:47.391
Find it! Fast.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.893
BOLO, on it, boss.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.397
I'll take the Beltway!

34:56.821 --> 34:57.725
Abby and I will see

34:57.749 --> 34:59.455
if we can access Otto's system remotely.

34:59.881 --> 35:01.521
I think I might be
able to help with that.

35:07.669 --> 35:09.050
Someone had to send Otto

35:09.074 --> 35:11.294
a remote command and navigational data.

35:11.382 --> 35:12.543
All we have to do is find it...

35:12.567 --> 35:14.237
so we can back-trace
it to our bad guy.

35:14.309 --> 35:16.718
If we access the vehicle,
can we remotely operate it?

35:16.843 --> 35:18.267
Yeah, I've seen Roni do it before.

35:18.486 --> 35:19.486
How?

35:19.608 --> 35:21.214
I don't know, man. I'm
just a mechanic, all right?

35:21.238 --> 35:22.835
All this A.I. stuff is
way out of my league.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.753
Okay, what's your job during test runs?

35:24.890 --> 35:25.684
I monitor stuff like

35:25.708 --> 35:27.619
tire pressure, fuel injectors...

35:27.643 --> 35:28.643
How?

35:28.790 --> 35:29.790
I have my own program.

35:30.331 --> 35:31.563
I mean, I could try...

35:31.595 --> 35:32.595
Do it.

35:32.831 --> 35:33.337
All right.

35:33.794 --> 35:35.512
But even if I can get
in, all I can tell you

35:35.536 --> 35:37.407
is stuff like oil
pressure and fuel levels.

35:37.989 --> 35:39.542
Navigation, external sensors,

35:39.566 --> 35:40.886
that's all handled by scientists.

35:46.222 --> 35:47.429
All right, I'm in. Now what?

35:48.015 --> 35:49.925
Just sit back and let the scientists...

35:49.949 --> 35:51.799
kick all kinds of major ass.

35:59.014 --> 36:00.612
Roni would've really liked you guys.

36:05.604 --> 36:07.145
Okay, Abby, we're in sync.

36:07.225 --> 36:08.788
You are now following
the same stream back

36:08.812 --> 36:10.127
into Otto as Jamie's program.

36:11.948 --> 36:12.350
Jamie,

36:12.374 --> 36:14.637
what's the most complex
sensor you monitor with this?

36:15.191 --> 36:16.315
I'd say fuel injectors.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.554
And when something goes
wrong, do you just monitor it,

36:18.578 --> 36:20.135
or is there something
you can actually do?

36:20.159 --> 36:21.399
I have the ability to tweak

36:21.423 --> 36:22.968
some of the parameters
to avoid engine damage.

36:22.992 --> 36:24.872
That's our way in. Is
that program on here, too?

36:25.155 --> 36:26.155
Yes...

36:26.540 --> 36:27.540
it's right there.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.902
Great. Before we were just receiving.

36:30.391 --> 36:31.711
Now we can send. Tweak something.

36:32.478 --> 36:33.397
All right. What?

36:33.453 --> 36:34.039
It doesn't matter.

36:34.232 --> 36:35.357
I just need to follow it

36:35.381 --> 36:36.537
downstream back into Otto.

36:37.298 --> 36:38.919
Okay. Um...

36:41.725 --> 36:42.725
How's that?

36:45.670 --> 36:46.670
I'm in.

36:48.029 --> 36:49.787
Pull up the navigation subdirectory.

36:50.818 --> 36:54.097
Accessing Otto's on board GPS.

36:56.549 --> 36:57.267
It's stopped.

36:57.408 --> 37:00.149
It's right off Route 123 in Fairfax.

37:00.221 --> 37:01.221
Go, McGee.

37:01.361 --> 37:02.581
I'll keep working on back-tracing

37:02.605 --> 37:03.685
the guy who sent him there.

37:20.623 --> 37:21.623
Clear!

37:25.414 --> 37:26.767
They took our chip, boss.

37:26.996 --> 37:28.876
Hey, McGee, when I told
you to put this car back

37:28.970 --> 37:30.307
together I didn't mean put it back

37:30.331 --> 37:31.756
together with the only piece of evidence

37:31.780 --> 37:32.719
we have on the killer.

37:32.743 --> 37:33.480
I didn't.

37:33.721 --> 37:35.623
We put in a copy.
Abby's got the original.

37:35.816 --> 37:37.551
Otto has five stereo cameras.

37:37.575 --> 37:39.315
Hoping one of them got
a picture of our guy.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.253
We're definitely dealing
with someone on the inside.

37:43.277 --> 37:45.022
He knew where all of
Otto's cameras were.

37:45.258 --> 37:46.583
The only shot I got is this.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.404
This thing takes worse
pictures than you do, McGee.

37:49.428 --> 37:51.844
They went to a lot of trouble
to get the chip back. Why?

37:52.438 --> 37:54.238
Like you said, It's the
only evidence we have.

37:54.589 --> 37:56.543
They know we can link it to 'em. How?

37:56.921 --> 37:58.722
There weren't any prints on the surface.

37:58.907 --> 38:00.232
The program's in assembly language.

38:00.256 --> 38:01.256
I'm not sure.

38:03.771 --> 38:04.614
Yeah. Gibbs.

38:04.654 --> 38:06.654
I back-traced the connection
used to activate Otto.

38:07.276 --> 38:08.690
They're in Azeon's network.

38:08.714 --> 38:09.714
They're online right now.

38:10.114 --> 38:11.999
I even have their... Gibbs?

38:14.953 --> 38:17.005
Don't worry, Jamie. We
are going to get this guy.

38:21.229 --> 38:22.902
You're sure about this, Agent Gibbs?

38:23.493 --> 38:25.041
We sure about this, McGee?

38:25.632 --> 38:27.601
Abby gave me the specific I.P. address

38:27.625 --> 38:29.337
for the computer used to access Otto.

38:29.493 --> 38:30.627
I'll know it when I find it.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.561
Which one was it?

38:34.846 --> 38:35.846
We're working on it.

38:42.395 --> 38:43.395
Boss?

38:43.689 --> 38:45.214
I.P. address matches this one.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.500
Engler.

38:51.318 --> 38:52.811
You're bastard! You killed her!

38:52.843 --> 38:53.937
Get him off me!

38:54.260 --> 38:56.109
What's the matter? You
couldn't share the limelight?!

38:56.133 --> 38:58.269
Why would I kill Seabrook?!

38:58.293 --> 39:00.489
You've been jealous of Roni
from the moment you met her.

39:00.513 --> 39:01.511
That's ridiculous!

39:01.535 --> 39:03.602
If anything, she was jealous of me.

39:04.329 --> 39:07.008
I demand to know what
proof you have against me.

39:11.237 --> 39:12.237
This.

39:12.768 --> 39:13.768
A flash chip?

39:13.982 --> 39:15.582
It was used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.

39:15.678 --> 39:17.471
The one you took from
the vehicle was a copy.

39:18.238 --> 39:19.719
Then let me see the code.

39:20.142 --> 39:22.228
Everyone here has their
own specific style.

39:22.252 --> 39:24.544
I can tell you with
certainty who wrote that one.

39:24.568 --> 39:26.587
As can I, Engler-may I?

39:43.207 --> 39:44.764
You're mistaken, Agent Gibbs,

39:45.563 --> 39:46.692
this chip is blank.

39:49.295 --> 39:50.295
Let him go.

39:51.247 --> 39:51.790
Boss?

39:52.158 --> 39:54.097
Let him go, he's the
one who found Seabrook.

39:54.956 --> 39:56.235
If he wanted the chip back,

39:56.259 --> 39:58.099
he would have taken it
before anyone got there.

39:59.942 --> 40:00.942
Dr. Pike...

40:05.107 --> 40:06.952
The only thing you erased from this chip

40:07.858 --> 40:08.872
are my photos.

40:12.629 --> 40:15.284
The real chip is in the
evidence locker at NCIS.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.189
She thought of you like a father!

40:18.632 --> 40:21.014
She was supposed to
take the morning off,

40:21.158 --> 40:22.158
Jamie.

40:23.927 --> 40:25.171
It was an accident.

40:26.592 --> 40:27.386
I would never...

40:27.593 --> 40:28.211
never...

40:28.451 --> 40:30.218
Who was supposed to
drive Otto that morning?

40:33.210 --> 40:34.210
Me.

40:34.750 --> 40:35.750
You...

40:36.075 --> 40:38.037
senile old fool,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.689
you were trying to kill me.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.440
I did it for all of us.

40:42.158 --> 40:43.459
He owns half the company.

40:43.866 --> 40:45.617
When Otto wins that race,

40:45.665 --> 40:48.394
we would have been stuck
working with him forever.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.541
Nobody deserves that.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.571
You smug bastard.

40:52.771 --> 40:54.614
I'll never? On this.

40:55.101 --> 40:56.101
Look...

40:56.266 --> 40:58.285
If "red light" is for
sexually assaulting

40:58.309 --> 41:00.547
a coworker, what color is for murder?

41:01.476 --> 41:02.625
How's "black light" sound?

41:03.471 --> 41:04.471
Works for me.

41:16.880 --> 41:17.880
Hey.

41:18.707 --> 41:19.707
It's late; Go home.

41:20.183 --> 41:21.899
Just doing a little research.

41:22.450 --> 41:23.450
On what?

41:24.265 --> 41:25.265
Y. Pestis.

41:26.339 --> 41:27.644
A very nasty illness.

41:28.234 --> 41:31.542
It can cause permanent damage
to the heart, lungs and kidneys,

41:31.582 --> 41:33.402
and in some cases, patients can relapse

41:33.426 --> 41:35.803
months or even years later.

41:36.904 --> 41:37.904
Tony had it.

41:38.173 --> 41:39.804
I know, Ziva, I was there.

41:40.307 --> 41:43.084
Did you know that he had
some tests done recently?

41:43.275 --> 41:45.908
And he's been wearing a
hospital bracelet on his wrist.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.440
No.

41:49.016 --> 41:50.668
I asked him why, but he won't tell me.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.128
And he's probably got
a pretty good reason.&.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.937
So, uh... can I take this off now?

42:17.979 --> 42:19.515
I haven't made up my mind yet.

42:19.994 --> 42:20.994
Okay.

42:21.351 --> 42:23.231
You do know that it's
for the psych ward, right?

42:24.718 --> 42:25.718
Oh, yeah.

42:26.034 --> 42:27.822
I picked it out special for you.
