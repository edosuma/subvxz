00:00.023 --> 00:01.631
Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.656 --> 00:04.203
Congratulations.
You're officially six weeks along.

00:04.367 --> 00:07.084
- We're pregnant.
- Oh, that's wonderful!

00:07.109 --> 00:08.913
- I'm glad you're happy.
- Oh, I'm not happy!

00:08.938 --> 00:11.414
I'm ecstatic! I'm a... I'm aquiver!

00:11.439 --> 00:13.552
I want to put on my happy song,
and I'm gonna be all...

00:13.576 --> 00:16.070
No, no, don't.
'Cause this might not happen.

00:16.094 --> 00:18.945
- In fact, it probably won't happen.
- What?

00:18.970 --> 00:20.234
I'm 37.

00:20.457 --> 00:22.085
And because of my weight, you know...

00:22.110 --> 00:24.106
You don't want to jinx things.

00:24.131 --> 00:26.800
Not about jinxing.

00:27.156 --> 00:29.867
This is about hope
that it doesn't turn disastrous.

00:30.026 --> 00:31.623
Randall, I need to tell you something.

00:31.648 --> 00:32.882
It's okay.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.204
I already know.

00:34.757 --> 00:36.218
Kate lost the baby.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.240
Number One has done it.

00:39.265 --> 00:40.902
- Number One has done it!
- Yes!

00:40.937 --> 00:42.640
And now the crowd...

00:42.665 --> 00:45.507
the crowd moves its
attention to the filly!

00:45.608 --> 00:47.469
- Oh, come on, sweetheart.
- Come on, sweetheart.

00:47.493 --> 00:49.695
- Come on, Number Two. Come on.
- Come on, Number Two.

00:49.846 --> 00:52.547
Come to us just like
your brother did. Come on.

00:52.582 --> 00:55.017
- That and straight forward.
- Think she's ready?

00:55.051 --> 00:56.982
I think she's ready. Here she comes.

01:00.855 --> 01:02.956
- Come on, Kate.
- She's a tough girl.

01:02.981 --> 01:05.248
I know. She's a fighter.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.492
She's a fighter. She's gonna do it.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.998
Chris, before we talk about
this game, let's talk about

01:10.033 --> 01:12.534
the game in four nights
when we go to Washington

01:12.568 --> 01:13.912
for the big Thanksgiving night game.

01:13.936 --> 01:15.765
I know these look like candy,

01:16.061 --> 01:18.046
but they're actually prenatal vitamins.

01:18.859 --> 01:20.335
Oh, my God.

01:20.929 --> 01:23.211
Your daddy tried to buy
prenatal Flintstone Vitamins,

01:23.246 --> 01:24.390
but they don't make them.

01:24.415 --> 01:25.881
I think he really identifies with

01:25.915 --> 01:28.054
Fred's whole
"Yabba dabba doo" philosophy.

01:28.079 --> 01:30.152

Jack! Fuse!

02:21.953 --> 02:24.125
Yup, I'm working on it!

02:24.150 --> 02:25.751
It's okay, Louie. Okay?

02:25.776 --> 02:27.445
Dad'll get the lights back on in a sec.

02:27.470 --> 02:29.905
Just don't panic pee, okay?

02:30.159 --> 02:32.843
Good boy. See? That's a good boy.

02:33.609 --> 02:35.093
And you're panic peeing.

02:35.206 --> 02:36.593
All right, yeah, great.

02:36.627 --> 02:38.661
Come on. Come on, Louie.

02:40.382 --> 02:41.723
Did Louie pee again?

02:41.758 --> 02:44.226
- Yes, Mom. I'm dealing with it.
- Killing me.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.871
Sorry to have interrupted
your evening, my liege.

02:45.895 --> 02:47.469
Why does it smell like
an orange threw up in here?

02:47.493 --> 02:50.641
It's the Bundt cake that I made
for Kevin's interview tonight.

02:50.666 --> 02:53.268
I think I maybe overdid it
with the orange zest.

02:53.302 --> 02:56.271
- Oh.
- There's a game every Friday.

02:56.305 --> 02:57.990
- Oh, thank God.
- Fixed it!

02:58.015 --> 02:59.210
Good job, babe.

03:01.007 --> 03:03.675
- W-Wait, is that what you're wearing?
- Mm-hmm.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.802
The coach from Pitt is
gonna be here any second.

03:05.827 --> 03:08.164
You should really stop borrowing
shirts from Sophie, Kevin.

03:08.417 --> 03:09.885
Mm. I don't really think

03:09.919 --> 03:11.912
the coach is gonna care
what shirt I'm wearing.

03:11.937 --> 03:15.265
- Whatever, Crop Top.
- Ew. What is that flavor?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.829
Kate! Can you clean his pee
anywhere else?

03:20.863 --> 03:23.265
A college coach is gonna be
sitting on that couch.

03:23.299 --> 03:25.179
Okay, well, I'm not
getting it on anything.

03:25.204 --> 03:29.125
And, uh, speaking of college,
have you made your list yet?

03:29.150 --> 03:30.972
Didn't the guidance counselor say

03:31.007 --> 03:32.808
to make a list of your top five schools?

03:32.842 --> 03:34.810
'Cause you don't want
to put all your eggs in...

03:34.844 --> 03:36.444
In one basket?
Yes, I know what she said.

03:36.695 --> 03:37.679
Okay.

03:37.713 --> 03:39.414
I have, like, a month to decide, Mom.

03:39.448 --> 03:40.849
Yeah, but a month?

03:40.882 --> 03:42.602
That'll go by like that.

03:44.353 --> 03:46.554
If you want, I can sit down
and we can go through that

03:46.579 --> 03:48.234
- whole college book together?
- I'm good.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.937
Just a list of five schools.

03:52.114 --> 03:53.335
That's all I ask.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.789
- Fine.
- Okay.

03:56.814 --> 03:58.033
He's here!

03:58.074 --> 03:59.546
Okay! Okay, okay.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.666
I'm out.

04:02.705 --> 04:04.742
- Hey, knock 'em dead.
- Train your dog.

04:04.818 --> 04:05.937
Make that list.

04:18.762 --> 04:21.421
Uh, this looks like a Shamrock Shake,

04:21.608 --> 04:24.170
and it sounds like a Shamrock Shake,

04:24.213 --> 04:27.687
but I'm guessing it does not
taste like a Shamrock Shake.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.710
How do you spell "Kundalini"?

04:30.443 --> 04:32.510
Uh, I have no idea what that is,

04:32.615 --> 04:34.649
so I clearly have
no idea how to spell it.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.671
But I'm guessing that it is
an expensive powder

04:36.706 --> 04:39.242
that you want me to start adding
to your pregnancy shakes.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.244
- No. It's a type of yoga.
- Huh.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.281
And I want to ask the doctor
if she recommends it.

04:44.306 --> 04:45.306
- Aha.
- Right.

04:45.343 --> 04:47.048
I always have so many questions

04:47.083 --> 04:48.617
- before the baby appointments.
- Yeah.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.336
Right? And then
I finally get in that room,

04:50.360 --> 04:52.367
and it's like an alien abduction.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.054
Like everything just
flies out of my head.

04:54.079 --> 04:55.934
- So I'm writing all the questions down.
- Okay.

04:55.958 --> 04:57.926
All right. Oh, oh,
make sure that you ask, uh,

04:57.960 --> 04:59.705
"When will the baby move?"
so that I can say,

04:59.729 --> 05:01.944
- "Hopefully, as soon as he turns 18."
- "As soon as he turns 18."

05:01.968 --> 05:03.507
- Yeah.
- Or she.

05:04.414 --> 05:06.609
- Yeah. Uh, joke still works.
- Yeah. Okay.

05:06.634 --> 05:08.196
But I think you've worn
that one out, Tobe.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.265
Never.

05:11.274 --> 05:12.265
All right.

05:12.290 --> 05:13.886
What else, what else, what else you got?

05:13.910 --> 05:15.010
Okay. Um...

05:15.148 --> 05:18.380
"Are my HCG levels
doubling every 48 hours?"

05:18.414 --> 05:20.406
"And why is my pee green?"

05:22.018 --> 05:24.523
- It's not the smoothie.
- Could be the smoothie.

05:25.234 --> 05:26.755
- It might be the smoothie.
- Yeah.

05:26.789 --> 05:28.290
Okay, and then also,

05:28.324 --> 05:30.429
"If I take a hot bath,
will it burn the baby?"

05:30.454 --> 05:31.781
- Oh! Which reminds me.
- Yeah.

05:31.806 --> 05:33.929
The Swedish baby bath
that we ordered is coming.

05:33.963 --> 05:35.764
- Yes!
- Um, and they said

05:35.798 --> 05:37.432
that it fits most tubs but not all tubs.

05:37.466 --> 05:38.934
Do you think it's gonna fit our tub?

05:39.125 --> 05:40.460
I have no idea.

05:40.485 --> 05:41.757
Okay.

05:41.953 --> 05:43.085
Where you going?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.242
- To measure the tub.
- Okay. All right.

05:45.267 --> 05:47.171
I'm gonna see what else you got here.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.111
All right, "How much
does childbirth hurt?"

05:50.250 --> 05:52.578
I do not think you want to know
the answer to that one.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.883
"Do they make knit caps for feet

05:54.917 --> 05:57.148
'cause I'm outgrowing all my socks?"

05:57.710 --> 05:59.921
Uh, "Will the smell of my fiancé's head

05:59.956 --> 06:01.690
make me gag the whole nine months?"

06:01.724 --> 06:04.302
Okay, well, this list just took
a turn for the hurtful.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.861
Toby!

06:06.896 --> 06:08.138
What?! What?!

06:14.003 --> 06:15.971
I know how difficult this is,

06:16.005 --> 06:18.006
but the good news is
is that you got pregnant,

06:18.040 --> 06:20.006
which means that you can try
again as soon as four weeks.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.910
Now, you passed
most of the tissue at home,

06:21.944 --> 06:24.089
so there's no need to put you
through the procedure of a D&C.

06:24.113 --> 06:26.716
I want you to expect bleeding
anywhere from five to 14 days.

06:26.741 --> 06:28.483
Otherwise, there's no reason

06:28.517 --> 06:30.380
you can't go back to living your life.

06:33.622 --> 06:34.990
I'll give you two some time alone.

06:35.024 --> 06:36.193
Okay. Thanks.

06:45.544 --> 06:46.801
Did you hear that?

06:46.836 --> 06:48.685
She said that we could try again, so...

06:49.152 --> 06:50.325
It's all right.

06:53.085 --> 06:54.365
I want to get dressed.

06:56.381 --> 06:58.146
Uh, yeah, okay.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.341
Ah, Kevin.

08:49.148 --> 08:51.271
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man?

08:51.516 --> 08:54.052
No. Portrait of a Young Man
Plucking Art.

08:54.077 --> 08:55.521
Hey. What do you think?

08:57.154 --> 08:59.990
I think you're a little
overdressed for a day of

09:00.015 --> 09:02.622
watching classic sitcoms
and trying not to cry.

09:02.647 --> 09:03.914
Oh. No.

09:04.073 --> 09:06.662
I have my lunch gig. Remember?

09:06.915 --> 09:09.283
We have that run-through
an hour before and...

09:09.380 --> 09:11.357
- Pinot. Downtown? Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:11.382 --> 09:12.717
No, I'm familiar with the job, I just...

09:12.741 --> 09:14.669
Hey, I-I thought
you would've canceled that.

09:14.694 --> 09:16.328
You know, it's only been,
like, 12 hours.

09:16.353 --> 09:17.896
Doesn't matter. If I bail last-minute,

09:17.921 --> 09:19.568
Peter's never gonna call me for gigs.

09:21.787 --> 09:22.849
Hey, come here.

09:22.874 --> 09:24.474
Just come sit with me, and we'll watch

09:24.499 --> 09:26.849
I Love Lucy and maybe some Good Times.

09:27.043 --> 09:28.443
I have to go to work.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.037
Okay. Well, then I'll take you.

09:31.543 --> 09:33.591
Wait. My Uber's almost here, so...

09:33.616 --> 09:35.404
Kate. Kate, Kate, Kate. This is insane.

09:38.146 --> 09:40.185
- What?
- We just had a miscarriage.

09:42.390 --> 09:44.271
Thanks. I know.

09:44.700 --> 09:45.927
I was there.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.482
Okay.

09:49.077 --> 09:51.612
Um, can I, can I
pick you up, afterwards?

09:51.755 --> 09:53.990
Sure. Uh, should be done around 3:30.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.763
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

09:55.788 --> 09:57.396
All right, yeah. 3:30.

10:11.490 --> 10:13.970
- Proud of you.
- Okay, bud, let's hit the road.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.826
Off to college already.

10:16.851 --> 10:18.208
Oh, great. Here we go.

10:18.325 --> 10:19.658
It's just a tour, Ma.

10:19.683 --> 10:21.342
- Still have a year of high school.
- I know.

10:21.366 --> 10:23.467
All right, so we're gonna see
you guys after Kev's game?

10:23.491 --> 10:25.544
- Yes.
- Dad, come on. It's a four-hour drive.

10:25.569 --> 10:27.569
I don't want to get there late
and make a bad impression.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.622
Randall, you're a math prodigy

10:29.647 --> 10:31.782
with insane SAT scores
and perfect grades.

10:31.938 --> 10:34.865
Any college would be lucky
to have a giant dork like you.

10:34.890 --> 10:36.693
Thanks, LL Cool K.

10:36.718 --> 10:38.652
- Mm. See ya.
- So, you guys out?

10:46.662 --> 10:48.419
- You could've knocked.
- I did.

10:48.787 --> 10:50.037
You didn't answer.

10:57.506 --> 11:00.201
- We're having a serious talk?
- No. No.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.052
Mom, every time you sit
on my bed, it's a serious talk.

11:04.306 --> 11:06.935
I just thought it must be tough...

11:06.960 --> 11:09.865
Classic start to one of
your serious talks.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.771
Will you just zip it, please?

11:11.835 --> 11:13.138
And sit down.

11:15.593 --> 11:18.732
I recognize that I may be
a little bit dense

11:19.255 --> 11:21.779
about all this college stuff.

11:22.389 --> 11:24.232
You have two brothers who know

11:24.257 --> 11:26.405
exactly what they want to do
with their life.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.794
Kevin's gonna go
play football somewhere,

11:28.819 --> 11:33.201
and Randall is gonna go
major in some math thing

11:33.226 --> 11:35.240
that none of us can understand.

11:36.171 --> 11:37.810
But you aren't your brothers.

11:38.317 --> 11:39.451
You're not.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.016
You don't know
what your path is just yet.

11:42.050 --> 11:43.349
And you know what?

11:43.719 --> 11:45.365
I think that's okay.

11:46.755 --> 11:48.956
At your age, it's great.

11:48.991 --> 11:50.646
Keep your options open.

11:50.893 --> 11:53.528
You go to some incredible
liberal arts college,

11:53.562 --> 11:56.597
and you can study
a bunch of different subjects

11:56.632 --> 11:59.372
until you figure out
what you're passionate about.

12:00.318 --> 12:01.529
Wow, Mom.

12:02.037 --> 12:04.539
Didn't realize you thought
I was passionless until now.

12:04.573 --> 12:05.750
- So, thanks for that.
- No, no.

12:05.774 --> 12:07.085
- That's not what I was saying, Kate.
- Yeah.

12:07.109 --> 12:08.653
Sweetheart, you know
that's not what I was saying.

12:08.677 --> 12:11.193
No, I got to get to school,
so I'll see you at Kevin's game.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.247
Bye, Louie. Be a good boy, okay?

12:17.119 --> 12:20.490
Hey, why don't you go
to, uh, veterinary school?

12:23.781 --> 12:25.915
What are we gonna do
with her, Louie? Huh?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.579
What? What are we gonna do?

12:27.604 --> 12:28.677
Oh.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.927
Hi. This is Kate Emily Pearson.

13:06.341 --> 13:10.802
Um... my audition song is "Summertime."

Uh, excuse me.

15:18.567 --> 15:22.269
Uh, my good man, uh,
I'm trying to prevent a package

15:22.304 --> 15:23.904
from being delivered to my apartment.

15:23.939 --> 15:25.283
I called, they said it might be here.

15:25.307 --> 15:26.540
I have a tracking number.

15:26.575 --> 15:27.852
Yeah, I don't know what they told you,

15:27.876 --> 15:29.769
but this isn't like
a customer service deal.

15:29.794 --> 15:31.808
It's a distro center.
Can't help you. Sorry.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.138
Hey. What's your name?

15:33.935 --> 15:35.269
- Karl.
- Hi, Karl.

15:35.294 --> 15:37.677
Uh, I am a large and powerful man.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.254
And on most days,
my stature is only a complement

15:40.288 --> 15:41.655
to my sharp comedic wit.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.991
But today, I am a man with a fiancée

15:44.026 --> 15:46.863
who has had a terrible last 12 hours.

15:46.888 --> 15:48.473
Right now, she's
somewhere in a red dress

15:48.497 --> 15:50.137
singing in the middle of the day

15:50.162 --> 15:52.334
because she can't face
how awful she feels.

15:52.359 --> 15:53.793
And that breaks my heart.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.436
So I'm not feeling all that funny.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.583
Okay, buddy, it ain't personal.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.044
- I just got...
- The hardest part, Karl,

15:58.068 --> 16:00.279
about seeing someone you love in pain

16:00.372 --> 16:02.076
is not being able
to do anything about it,

16:02.110 --> 16:03.544
except try not to make it worse.

16:03.578 --> 16:05.746
Which brings me here,
to intercept a package

16:05.781 --> 16:07.915
that, were it to arrive on our doorstep,

16:07.949 --> 16:10.708
would most certainly make it worse.

16:12.396 --> 16:14.537
I am a large and powerful man, Karl.

16:15.253 --> 16:17.701
And I don't know how much longer
I can stay this calm.

16:24.576 --> 16:26.388
Okay, it's not on a truck. Not yet.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.135
But I can't tell you where it is.

16:28.341 --> 16:29.810
Could be anywhere in here.

16:31.036 --> 16:32.208
Where do I start?

16:42.795 --> 16:45.685
Your poppy seed
is now the size of a lentil.

16:46.241 --> 16:48.779
Congratulations. You're
officially six weeks along.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.068
We're pregnant.

16:52.093 --> 16:53.549
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- I'm glad you're happy.

16:53.573 --> 16:55.073
Oh, I'm not happy!

16:55.108 --> 16:56.544
I'm ecstatic!

16:57.021 --> 16:58.121
We're pregnant.

16:58.740 --> 16:59.779
You're preg...?

16:59.804 --> 17:01.056
- We're pregnant!
- Oh, my God!

17:01.080 --> 17:02.372
This is amazing!

17:36.282 --> 17:39.484
Defense! Defense!

17:39.519 --> 17:41.201
- Milk Dud?
- No, thank you.

17:41.387 --> 17:44.189
Defense! Defense!

17:44.223 --> 17:46.224
Hike!

17:48.177 --> 17:49.347
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:49.372 --> 17:51.096
Break it! Break it! Break it!

17:53.432 --> 17:54.432
Yeah, Kev!

17:55.005 --> 17:57.045
Another first down for number one.

17:57.069 --> 17:58.870
That's three in a row on his own, folks.

17:58.905 --> 17:59.905
Go!

18:19.936 --> 18:21.357
- $50?
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.552 --> 18:24.583
Yeah, it's for your application fee.

18:25.185 --> 18:26.693
You went through my stuff?

18:27.156 --> 18:28.224
No, I...

18:29.060 --> 18:30.130
I...

18:30.155 --> 18:31.970
Okay, yeah, I did a little bit. Sorry.

18:32.004 --> 18:33.661
Yeah, great. Maybe I should use this $50

18:33.686 --> 18:35.310
to put a new lock on my door.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.322
Okay. I'm sorry.

18:37.356 --> 18:39.168
I shouldn't have gone
through your stuff, Kate,

18:39.192 --> 18:40.725
but I didn't really have a choice.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.458
You've been so closed off to me.

18:42.895 --> 18:44.287
I mean, why wouldn't you tell me?

18:44.502 --> 18:45.576
Huh?

18:46.029 --> 18:48.598
Bug, I had no idea

18:48.677 --> 18:50.771
that you were even
interested in singing again.

18:50.937 --> 18:52.357
Well, I am.

18:55.108 --> 18:56.294
I could've helped you.

18:56.738 --> 18:58.172
Yeah. I know.

19:08.303 --> 19:11.130
Well, I thought you sounded terrific.

19:13.259 --> 19:14.412
I did.

19:14.437 --> 19:16.872
I mean, the song selection was perfect.

19:16.976 --> 19:18.974
Really highlighted your vocal range.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.185
Thanks.

19:26.472 --> 19:28.302
Well, I think you have a real shot.

19:29.675 --> 19:30.802
I do.

19:40.361 --> 19:41.677
Oh, my God, it's Kevin.

19:42.445 --> 19:43.591
Is that Kevin?

19:51.420 --> 19:52.687
Okay, go call your father.

19:52.721 --> 19:54.051
- Yeah.
- Find a phone, page him.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.083
- Okay, Mom.
- Go, go, go.

19:55.108 --> 19:56.828
- Kate, Kate, go.
- Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

21:00.632 --> 21:03.033
Sorry, man. This is the last
section it could be in.

21:33.355 --> 21:35.716
Hey, uh, you said Kate Pearson, right?

21:35.872 --> 21:37.083
Is this it?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.607
Yeah. That appears to be it.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.802
Thank you.

21:42.716 --> 21:44.826
- Just sign right there.
- Yeah.

21:46.802 --> 21:48.716
- Glad I could help.
- Yeah.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.225
- You have a good day.
- Yeah, you, too.

21:50.249 --> 21:53.218
Uh, uh, Karl, do you have
a, uh, baby at home?

21:53.243 --> 21:54.591
Uh, no.

21:54.789 --> 21:58.240
But my sister's actually due
for her third any-any day now.

21:58.811 --> 21:59.966
You like her?

22:01.708 --> 22:03.051
Okay. You know what?

22:03.085 --> 22:04.342
Why don't you give it to her anyways.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.029
It's a fancy baby bath.

22:10.593 --> 22:12.146
Fits in most tubs.

22:13.335 --> 22:15.035
Anyway, so, you want it?

22:15.826 --> 22:18.326
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Yeah.

22:21.236 --> 22:23.232
I'm sorry if something happened.

22:25.529 --> 22:26.696
Yeah.

22:43.787 --> 22:45.555
Hey. Where's Kate?

22:45.589 --> 22:47.233
I've been double-parked
outside for 20 minutes.

22:47.257 --> 22:48.458
She's not answering my calls.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.393
Oh, she took off a couple hours ago.

22:50.427 --> 22:52.198
She got sick in the middle
of set or something.

22:52.222 --> 22:53.973
What-what do you mean she got sick?

22:54.763 --> 22:55.932
I don't know.

22:55.966 --> 22:57.934
I'm sorry. I figured she just went home.

22:58.521 --> 23:00.615
Okay. Uh... yep. Okay.

23:03.529 --> 23:04.874
Leave a message for Kate.

23:04.908 --> 23:06.876
Uh, hey, I'm here at the cafe.

23:06.910 --> 23:09.443
Uh, they said that you left
early, that you got sick.

23:09.468 --> 23:11.466
Uh, where are you?
Please, please, please call me.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.599
Okay, bye.

23:18.294 --> 23:21.505
Hey, it's Kevin. Leave a message.
Or better yet, send a text.

23:26.681 --> 23:27.927
Tobe?

23:32.019 --> 23:33.169
Tobe?

23:57.695 --> 23:59.404
- Yeah?
- Hi, honey.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.598
I've been trying to get ahold of you.

24:02.633 --> 24:04.615
What's... Are you okay?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.505
I lost the baby, Mom.

24:08.591 --> 24:09.904
Don't say anything.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.326
I just want to tell you so you know

24:13.167 --> 24:14.935
and it can be over.

24:16.213 --> 24:18.248
- Oh, Bug.
- Okay?

24:18.662 --> 24:20.982
- Is there anything that I can...
- Look, I got to go, Mom.

24:21.357 --> 24:23.517
Okay. Just... I don't know what to...

24:29.787 --> 24:32.467
Hey, it's Kevin. Leave a message.
Or better yet, send a text.

24:34.688 --> 24:35.817
K...

24:47.445 --> 24:48.544
Hey.

24:49.079 --> 24:50.427
Thank God.

24:51.138 --> 24:52.247
Are you okay?

24:53.349 --> 24:54.884
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:56.544 --> 24:57.607
You're fine.

24:58.115 --> 25:00.056
What the, uh, what the hell happened?

25:00.090 --> 25:01.576
You knew I was picking you up.

25:02.216 --> 25:03.426
I'm s... I'm sorry.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.027
I should have called. I...

25:05.062 --> 25:07.193
Yeah, I thought you were
in a hospital or something.

25:08.247 --> 25:11.410
- Oh, okay. Well, I wasn't.
- Yeah, I can see that.

25:11.435 --> 25:12.662
Where were you?

25:12.687 --> 25:14.089
I was walking.

25:14.365 --> 25:16.405
'Kay. Walking where?

25:16.537 --> 25:19.037
Oh, my... I just was walking, Tobe.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.294
Okay?

25:21.076 --> 25:23.713
- What?
- No. No, it is not okay.

25:23.747 --> 25:27.333
I was driving around like
some nut job looking for you.

25:27.599 --> 25:29.943
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you put out?

25:30.060 --> 25:32.496
Did you have a couple
of emotional hours?

25:32.521 --> 25:35.258
'Cause I'm going to be a raging
hormone machine for weeks

25:35.397 --> 25:38.076
while my body still thinks
it's pregnant.

25:38.435 --> 25:39.762
So that's fun.

25:40.615 --> 25:43.091
Okay, let's not... let's not do this.

25:43.138 --> 25:44.347
- Oh, no.
- This is...

25:44.372 --> 25:46.035
Let's do this.
I think we should do this.

25:46.069 --> 25:47.357
Let's just go big.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.098
'Cause that's how
you like to do things, right?

25:50.280 --> 25:52.927
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

25:52.976 --> 25:54.577
No, no, no. Go ahead, Kate, say it.

25:54.611 --> 25:55.812
What is that supposed to mean?

25:55.846 --> 25:57.005
It means...

25:58.064 --> 26:00.216
that I wanted to be cautious about this.

26:00.849 --> 26:02.607
I didn't want to get excited.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.620
- But you...
- Okay. Okay.

26:04.655 --> 26:06.622
You pushed and you pushed.

26:06.657 --> 26:08.443
So, congratulations, Toby.

26:09.302 --> 26:10.660
You got me excited.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.962
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
apologize about being excited.

26:12.996 --> 26:15.294
- Okay.
- We didn't lose the baby

26:15.326 --> 26:16.499
because we got our hopes up.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.510
- Right.
- All right? It just happened.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.802
Toby, it happened to me.

26:19.837 --> 26:22.060
It didn't happen to you.

26:31.599 --> 26:35.185
When I woke up this morning,
I forgot for a split second.

26:37.412 --> 26:39.857
I was just looking at you
and thinking, "Wow.

26:40.524 --> 26:42.044
She's having our baby."

26:44.619 --> 26:46.747
And then I blinked, and I remembered.

26:48.498 --> 26:50.499
And I slid out of bed
as quietly as possible

26:50.534 --> 26:52.802
because I thought that
if there was a chance that maybe

26:52.836 --> 26:54.833
you were dreaming and forgetting, too...

26:55.072 --> 26:57.073
well, I didn't want
to wake you from that.

26:58.654 --> 27:01.310
Now, I will be
your entire support system

27:01.345 --> 27:02.576
through all of this.

27:02.601 --> 27:05.214
I will hold your head in my lap,
and I will stroke your hair,

27:05.249 --> 27:07.783
and I will tell you that
everything is gonna be okay

27:07.818 --> 27:09.466
until the cows come home.

27:09.615 --> 27:13.341
But what I will not do...
what is not fair for you to do

27:13.366 --> 27:16.505
is to tell me that
I wasn't a part of this.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.115
Now, yeah, it didn't happen to my body.

27:22.177 --> 27:23.333
I get that.

27:23.358 --> 27:25.724
I have no idea
what that must be like for you.

27:25.787 --> 27:27.881
And I'm trying to be strong here
'cause that's the gig,

27:27.905 --> 27:29.646
but it happened to me, too.

27:32.007 --> 27:33.224
And it hurt.

27:46.890 --> 27:49.058
Perfectly comfortable like this.

27:49.092 --> 27:50.893
So am I.

27:51.810 --> 27:54.419
Shouldn't we have gotten,
like, an update by now?

27:56.315 --> 27:58.966
Yeah, apparently MRIs
take quite a while.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.771
At least the coffee's cold.

28:10.138 --> 28:11.279
Mom.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.943
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Berklee.

28:14.758 --> 28:15.974
It's just...

28:17.677 --> 28:19.177
you know, if I don't get in...

28:20.146 --> 28:21.552
I think it'll crush me.

28:22.490 --> 28:23.513
But...

28:24.029 --> 28:25.828
but I just could not deal with

28:25.862 --> 28:28.169
disappointing you on top of that.

28:32.216 --> 28:33.436
Bug, for the record,

28:33.470 --> 28:36.806
I would be disappointed
for you, not for me.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.716
Yeah. Sometimes it's hard
to feel the difference.

28:54.104 --> 28:55.537
My mom was tough.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.372
I mean, you know that. You've seen it.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.287
She was just a...

29:02.122 --> 29:03.763
closed steel door.

29:04.865 --> 29:06.268
And even if you could get through,

29:06.303 --> 29:09.419
there was a room full of spikes
right behind it.

29:11.771 --> 29:13.776
And I always wanted to have a daughter,

29:13.810 --> 29:15.865
because I wanted to do it
a different way.

29:16.486 --> 29:19.169
I wanted to be the mom that had her...

29:20.717 --> 29:25.724
arms wide open, just waiting for
you to fall in if you needed it.

29:27.958 --> 29:29.388
And, somehow...

29:30.552 --> 29:31.841
I don't know...

29:31.881 --> 29:34.068
we just never got there, did we?

29:34.677 --> 29:37.068
- Mom...
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

29:37.169 --> 29:39.154
It's not your job
to make me feel better.

29:39.669 --> 29:41.037
It's not. It's my job.

29:42.263 --> 29:48.010
It's my job to keep standing
there with my arms wide open,

29:48.045 --> 29:52.583
waiting for you to maybe someday

29:53.457 --> 29:55.365
fall inside if you needed it.

29:57.732 --> 29:59.576
And if you do, I'll love you.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.024
And if you don't,

30:02.404 --> 30:03.669
I'll love you, too.

30:04.709 --> 30:07.365
Because that's what it means
to be a parent.

30:09.784 --> 30:11.285
You'll see one day.

30:15.365 --> 30:17.037
- They're doing an MRI.
- Okay.

30:17.062 --> 30:18.440
It's his knee.

30:53.577 --> 30:54.810
Tobe?

31:09.926 --> 31:11.810
Did you forget your keys, Tobe?

31:36.364 --> 31:37.497
I'm here.

31:39.794 --> 31:41.122
I'm right here.

31:51.553 --> 31:53.857
I can't take a shower.
There's no curtain.

31:55.534 --> 31:57.685
I can draw you a bath.

32:05.115 --> 32:08.284
Can you just come sit with me
for a minute?

32:09.201 --> 32:10.599
Yeah, of course.

32:20.665 --> 32:22.974
How can I be this sad?

32:25.010 --> 32:26.763
I never even met the baby.

32:27.705 --> 32:29.029
And never held him.

32:29.246 --> 32:30.419
Or her.

32:31.921 --> 32:34.388
Wasn't even old enough for me to know.

32:39.202 --> 32:40.943
I never held Kyle.

32:44.771 --> 32:47.029
I remember they asked me if I wanted to

32:47.054 --> 32:48.560
because it helps, um...

32:50.395 --> 32:53.747
mothers with, um... closure.

32:54.691 --> 32:57.271
You know, to hold the baby
and to say good-bye.

33:00.513 --> 33:03.365
But I didn't want to do that
because I felt like

33:03.390 --> 33:06.292
if I didn't hold him, somehow
it would lessen the pain,

33:06.317 --> 33:10.685
which wasn't the case,
obviously, because I...

33:11.374 --> 33:13.810
I knew him already.

33:15.204 --> 33:17.138
He was so real to me.

33:18.451 --> 33:21.419
I mean, the second I found out
I was pregnant with you guys,

33:21.444 --> 33:23.445
you were all so real to me.

33:26.181 --> 33:29.122
And then the wondering set in.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.974
You know, did I do this?

33:30.999 --> 33:32.037
Did I do something wrong?

33:32.062 --> 33:34.697
Did I... sleep on the wrong side?

33:34.722 --> 33:36.289
Should I have gone on that walk?

33:36.314 --> 33:39.052
'Cause the day you guys were born,

33:39.077 --> 33:40.951
I went on this long, hot walk.

33:40.976 --> 33:42.310
It wasn't your fault.

33:42.335 --> 33:44.076
And this wasn't yours.

33:44.793 --> 33:46.894
But with me, it's different.

33:47.123 --> 33:48.924
- Because maybe it was...
- Maybe it...?

33:48.949 --> 33:50.263
Maybe it was my fault.

33:50.455 --> 33:52.107
Maybe it wasn't.

33:53.162 --> 33:56.505
I know, but I feel like
I just took this from Toby.

33:57.779 --> 33:59.287
Yeah, but you didn't.

33:59.783 --> 34:00.912
I know, but...

34:01.904 --> 34:05.247
but it feels that way,
if that makes any sense.

34:07.341 --> 34:09.091
You need to talk to him, sweetheart.

34:09.116 --> 34:10.793
You have to share all this.

34:12.371 --> 34:13.451
I mean, you know,

34:13.476 --> 34:16.896
I held my grief
from your father for weeks.

34:17.587 --> 34:21.371
I thought it would hurt him
to see how sad I was.

34:26.677 --> 34:30.427
Did I ever tell you that story
about going to the grocery store

34:30.452 --> 34:32.168
with you guys when you were...

34:33.141 --> 34:34.443
six weeks old?

34:36.117 --> 34:38.505
Your father and I hadn't had a real meal

34:38.654 --> 34:41.621
in a long time,
and I really wanted to make him

34:41.647 --> 34:43.661
this beer and rump roast

34:43.853 --> 34:46.201
that I had seen on
The Galloping Gourmet.

34:46.822 --> 34:49.536
And it required a bag of yellow onions.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.107
Oh.

34:53.245 --> 34:54.951
Hey.

34:58.817 --> 34:59.888
Oh.

35:00.438 --> 35:01.630
Sorr... That...

35:01.727 --> 35:04.229
- Those were my onions.
- I'm sorry?

35:04.412 --> 35:06.629
Those were my onions.
You just took them from me.

35:06.654 --> 35:08.660
No, I got them from
the display right here.

35:08.685 --> 35:09.752
Yeah, I under...

35:09.786 --> 35:11.396
Excuse me, where are you going, lady?

35:11.421 --> 35:13.341
Those were my onions,
and you took them from me.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.400
- I want them back.
- What are you, crazy?

35:15.425 --> 35:17.192
No, I'm not crazy. I want my onions!

35:17.227 --> 35:18.704
- You're crazy.
- Is there a problem here?

35:18.728 --> 35:20.052
Yeah, I... Yes.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.224
Okay, there is a problem.

35:22.249 --> 35:23.490
Um...

35:23.589 --> 35:25.223
I went to go grab that bag of onions.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.049
I turn my back for two seconds
to look after my babies,

35:28.074 --> 35:30.175
and that woman took them from me.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.982
- Ma'am, just calm down.
- I-I'm calm, okay?

35:33.007 --> 35:35.754
I'm not gonna calm down though,
because what I want

35:35.779 --> 35:37.920
is for you to tell her
to give me my onions back, okay?

35:37.944 --> 35:39.544
I-I...

35:39.569 --> 35:43.091
I have a recipe that calls for
four ounces of yellow onion.

35:43.169 --> 35:45.621
And-and I've been planning
this dish for a whole week,

35:45.655 --> 35:48.107
and I'm not gonna leave here
without my yellow onion.

35:48.258 --> 35:49.849
Miss, would you like to sit down?

35:49.874 --> 35:52.099
No, I don't, I don't...
I don't want to sit down.

35:52.124 --> 35:54.240
I want you to tell her
to give me my onion back.

35:54.265 --> 35:55.365
I just, I want...

35:55.390 --> 35:57.677
I want what I came for, okay?

35:57.702 --> 35:59.768
I want my yellow onion.
I want what's fair.

35:59.803 --> 36:01.436
Will you, will you, will you tell her

36:01.471 --> 36:03.438
to give me my onion back?
Because it's not fair

36:03.483 --> 36:05.069
that I have to sit here
and go without my yellow onion.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.093
It's not fair.

36:06.459 --> 36:09.495
It's not fair! It's not fair!

36:10.302 --> 36:13.474
You unleashed holy hell
on some unsuspecting lady?

36:13.552 --> 36:15.568
I did.

36:16.028 --> 36:18.029
- Mom.
- Yeah.

36:18.501 --> 36:21.638
And then I ended up going home
and burning the pot roast.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.841
- No.
- Yeah.

36:24.935 --> 36:26.052
But...

36:27.101 --> 36:29.537
eventually, I opened up to your dad.

36:30.607 --> 36:33.068
And that's what gave space in my heart

36:33.102 --> 36:34.318
for you and Kevin.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.896
And it made space in my heart
for Randall, too.

36:39.709 --> 36:42.263
Yeah, a little too much
for Randall, if you ask me.

36:43.029 --> 36:44.037
Seriously?

36:44.904 --> 36:46.419
No.

36:46.583 --> 36:48.232
I'm kidding. Sorry.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.904
'Cause I love you
more than I can bear, Bug.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.309
I love you, too.

37:02.671 --> 37:03.974
Talk to Toby.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.044
All right, you guys, um...

37:53.357 --> 37:55.301
you guys wait with your brother, okay?

37:55.326 --> 37:57.701
Your mom and I are gonna go get the car.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.552
- Okay.
- Pull it around, okay?

38:03.107 --> 38:04.615
Can you get me something to drink?

38:05.622 --> 38:06.693
Sure.

38:07.101 --> 38:08.146
Thank you.

38:41.552 --> 38:42.747
Hi.

38:43.742 --> 38:44.880
Oh, hi.

38:46.607 --> 38:47.794
My mom came.

38:48.929 --> 38:50.294
I see that.

38:52.412 --> 38:53.591
I am...

38:54.872 --> 38:57.919
gonna go grab some coffee
at that place around the corner.

38:58.220 --> 38:59.721
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:11.327 --> 39:13.505
- Want to sit with me?
- Yeah.

39:17.256 --> 39:20.325
What, uh... what were you...?

39:20.685 --> 39:22.044
- Come here.
- Oh.

39:23.049 --> 39:24.732
Oh. Okay. Yep.

39:26.986 --> 39:28.987
- Just go with it.
- Okay.

39:34.724 --> 39:36.608
This is sweet, but I-I really think

39:36.642 --> 39:38.646
this is more your thing than mine.

39:39.365 --> 39:40.656
- So why don't... Can we...
- Okay.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.514
- Can we switch? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

39:43.990 --> 39:47.122
- Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.
- Yeah.

39:52.021 --> 39:53.747
I feel like I failed you.

39:54.388 --> 39:55.458
Mm.

39:57.223 --> 39:58.505
You didn't.

39:59.399 --> 40:00.826
You never could.

40:06.451 --> 40:07.672
I want to try again.

40:07.755 --> 40:08.755
Not yet.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.740
But maybe soon.

40:15.435 --> 40:16.599
Yeah, me, too.

40:18.412 --> 40:20.085
Whenever you're ready.

40:45.029 --> 40:46.740
We will not let this break us.

40:48.121 --> 40:49.357
No, we will not.

40:53.630 --> 40:55.021
I love you.

41:00.997 --> 41:02.138
My God.

41:03.997 --> 41:06.115
Come here.

41:18.302 --> 41:19.711
Hey, Randall.

41:19.745 --> 41:22.130
Randall, give your sister some space.

41:22.782 --> 41:25.015
Come on, Number Three!

41:27.109 --> 41:29.287
Okay, Number Three, it's your turn.
