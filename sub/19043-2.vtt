04:54.628 --> 04:55.961
There should be a river
north of here,

04:55.963 --> 04:57.562
So we'll just go
by way of the river

04:57.564 --> 04:59.331
And, uh, find the rails.

separate, you know?

Make it harder
for them to find us.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.127
Is that possible?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.795
No.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.997
Ah, so american.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.632
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

10:33.634 --> 10:34.899
I'm going to get my seat.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.134
Okay.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.168
Hello.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.737
That's troy.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.172
Okay. Well, I'll see you
later, okay?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.407
Okay. Bye.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.175
Oh.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.745
See you, cowboy.
Bye, cowboys.

10:46.747 --> 10:47.812
Ciao.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.148
That's my wife.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.683
Let's go.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.118
All right, guys,
let's get, uh,

10:53.120 --> 10:54.919
Get to work.
Let's have a good show.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.157
All right, now you
do five minutes

10:59.159 --> 11:00.692
Just right off the top.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.993
Five minutes of what?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.829
Well, whatever will
get them all whooped up

11:04.831 --> 11:06.131
And to hollering.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.432
Hey, chip.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.833
Hey.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.168
Hey, martha.
What are you doing here?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.369
I mean, hello.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.371
Well, I just thought
I'd show up.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.207
And this is my niece
and nephew bella and luke.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.176
They wanted to see
some of the horses.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.744
Hi, guys.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.181
Yeah, they're definitely
related to you.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.449
Eddie:
Come on, baskets.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.285
No sense dillydallying
like a shot-up mule.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.987
I'm dillydallying
like a shot-up mule.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.321
What do you need,
martha?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.456
I just wanted to give you

11:31.458 --> 11:32.991
The joke book
I found at the dump,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.693
Just in case
you need it later.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.960
Okay. Thanks.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.129
It, um, kind of smells
like banana peels

11:38.131 --> 11:39.464
- If you want to--
- yeah.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.700
...Work that into
your act somehow.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.901
Thank you very much.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.469
Okay. Well, break a leg.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.704
Okay.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.372
Martha,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.307
Take the children
back to the corn.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.745
Come on, guys. Let's go
see where the beer is.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.147

11:56.149 --> 11:59.818
Whoo!

11:59.820 --> 12:01.386

12:01.388 --> 12:03.455
Hey, martha. Hey, kids.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.525
How's everybody
doing tonight?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.994
good. Um,

So thank you for--

It's a good, uh...

12:29.916 --> 12:33.084
Maybe I'll, uh... I have a--

Okay, here's one.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.922
"an american went into
a london tea shop."

12:37.924 --> 12:39.090
Oh, god.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.258
Get on with it!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.026
Ladies and gentlemen,

The griffith family!

12:45.865 --> 12:47.932
Hey, there, y'all!

12:53.273 --> 12:55.507

13:22.468 --> 13:24.135
Hey, chuck.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.337
Hey, you know
how every night

13:26.339 --> 13:27.972
I'm up there
doing my, uh,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.974
<i>"clune sous la pluie"</i> act?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.910
I don't think so.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.078
Yeah, the one where you
release the bull every night.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.346
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, uh,

13:35.348 --> 13:37.415
Tonight can you
maybe not release,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.117
- Uh, the bull?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.285
Well, that's
the best part.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.486
I know it's the best part,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
But my wife is going
to be in the audience,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.589
And I'd like to impress her,

13:44.591 --> 13:46.157
And I think I have
a shot with her,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.325
You know, romantically,

13:47.327 --> 13:48.827
If you don't
release the bull.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.161
All right.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.396
Okay. Thanks. Can I have--

The next one.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.959
Hey, chip.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.429
Hey, great job, you know?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.530
Thanks.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.465
Um, in retrospect,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.101
Maybe using a joke book
I found at a landfill

15:37.103 --> 15:38.970
Wasn't that great
of an idea,

15:38.972 --> 15:40.471
But you still did
a really good job.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.940
Penelope left.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.474
Um, well,

15:43.476 --> 15:46.110
Maybe this
just isn't her thing.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.946
Yeah, maybe I'm not
her thing, either.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.380
You know?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.282
Well, um,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.985
I hate to ask you this
when you're sulking,

15:53.987 --> 15:55.954
But my niece and nephew

15:55.956 --> 15:57.555
Really wanted
to get autographs

15:57.557 --> 15:59.457
From the trick riders,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.125
If that's possible.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.660
Okay. Yeah.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.129
Um, yeah. Come on, guys.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.098
Come on. I'll take you over.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.133
- Hey, uh--
- hey, there.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.301
These are
a couple of fans,

16:10.303 --> 16:11.469
And they'd like
some autographs.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.072
Of course. Yes.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.140
Gallen, demmy,
we have fans.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.308
Look at that.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.477
Wow, look at all
those smiles, martha.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.347
Oh, my goodness.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.682
I don't know, whenever I see
people smiling that much,

16:24.684 --> 16:27.685
I always think
they're about to have
a nervous breakdown.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.323
Well, you'll never have
a nervous breakdown, I guess.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.158
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't smile, martha.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.493
You'll have
a nervous breakdown.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.097
Excuse me. Can we get
your autograph, too?

16:40.265 --> 16:41.299
Okay.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.266
Sure.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.705
Here. That's $25 each.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.041
where's the bathroom?

16:50.043 --> 16:52.443
Uh, come on, squirt.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.545
I'll show you.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.515
All right, young man,
there's your urinal.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.685
Actually, can I pee-pee
outside like the clowns?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.521
You want to pee-pee
outside like the clowns?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.023
Okay. Yeah. Right this way.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.391
Huh.

17:10.129 --> 17:13.297
A grown man smiling
at a kid pissing.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.199
It's my friend's
nephew, bingo.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.373
That's not your
pee hand, is it?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.042
Maybe.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.410
Maybe?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.245
Oh, boy.

17:43.495 --> 17:45.263
I'm not having fun.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.531
Who said
this was about fun?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.066
You guys love this stuff.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.767
Playing cops and robbers
all day.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.402
It's not for me.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.237
This your first time
running from the cops?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.840
No. It's my second time.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.276
First time was in France,
but they just had whistles.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.445
They said,
"freeze, or we'll whistle."

18:00.447 --> 18:02.346
Because the cops got guns
in this country,

18:02.348 --> 18:05.083
We got to be scared
into living some normal,
pre-approved life?

18:05.085 --> 18:06.284
That sucks, dude.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.590
Just tired of making my life
harder than it needs to be.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.791
Morpheus: Yeah.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.763
I hear that.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.198
Thanks, morpheus.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.467
Yeah.
I mean, I had a kid.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.602
Daughter, I guess.

18:24.604 --> 18:29.807
Got super scared.
Shit, a kid. A kid.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.243
So I bailed.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.811
At first I just
ran off for the weekend,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.279
Hitched to santa cruz,

18:35.281 --> 18:36.814
And partied pretty hard.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.283
I had fun, you know?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.786
But once I sobered up,
I was, like, embarrassed.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.156
I didn't want to go home
and have to explain that.

18:45.158 --> 18:48.292
So a couple months went by,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.461
And that feeling,
that embarrassment, man,

18:50.463 --> 18:52.430
It just grew like a tumor.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.600
And by now it's been,
like, years.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.801
Probably walking around

18:56.803 --> 18:59.103
Learning the alphabet
and shit.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.240
Anyway,
I know it's not cool,

19:02.242 --> 19:03.841
But that is me.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.743
What's your excuse?

19:06.912 --> 19:08.479
I don't know,
but I don't have

19:08.481 --> 19:10.214
A one-man show about it,
that's for sure.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.584
Train.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.319
All right,
let's catch this one.
