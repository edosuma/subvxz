WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO GO OFF TO COLLEGE?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.376
TO GET AWAY
FROM MOM AND DAD.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.179

IS THAT YOU'RE IN POSSESSION
OF A HEXED ESSAY.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.185
THERE WILL BE
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION,

23:39.218 --> 23:43.756
AND THERE WILL
BE CONSEQUENCES.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
SCARLETT DID THAT.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.861
I SHOULD MAKE HER DISAPPEAR.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.598
MAYBE SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.601
YOU WERE RANTING.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.502
WHY IN THE WORLD

23:55.535 --> 23:58.571
WOULD SCARLETT SINISTER
BE JEALOUS OF ME?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.473
LOOK.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.080
ETHAN, THAT'S SO SWEET.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.081
P.A.: MARNIE PIPER.

24:09.115 --> 24:14.186
YOU ARE WANTED IN THE
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE, NOW.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.756
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.229
DR. GOODWYN,
I KNOW WHY I'M HERE,

24:23.262 --> 24:24.196
AND IN MY DEFENSE--

24:24.230 --> 24:26.533
MARNIE, YOU'RE
NOT IN TROUBLE.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.834
I'M NOT?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.135
HOW WEIRD.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.770
TEA?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.173
THANKS.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.943
SO, CAN WE FIND OUT
WHO HEXED MY ESSAY?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.612
SOME SPELLS LEAVE
A GENETIC FINGERPRINT,

24:39.646 --> 24:40.780
BUT THIS ONE WAS TOO COMMON.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.715
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.819
SO, HOW ARE YOU ADJUSTING?

24:46.853 --> 24:50.089
HONESTLY, I CAME
HERE TO LEARN ALCHEMY

24:50.122 --> 24:52.224
AND AMULETS,
POTIONS AND PORTENCE.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.727
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU OFFER

24:54.761 --> 24:56.095
AN ELECTIVE
JUST FOR WITCHES?

24:56.128 --> 24:57.664
YOU DIDN'T READ
THE HANDBOOK?

24:57.697 --> 24:58.765
I SKIMMED.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.266
WHEN THIS SCHOOL
WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED,

25:00.299 --> 25:02.535
AN ENCHANTMENT WAS
PLACED ON THE CAMPUS.

25:02.569 --> 25:05.004
ALL SPELLS CAST
AT WITCH UNIVERSITY

25:05.037 --> 25:07.740
BECOME PERMANENT
AT MIDNIGHT ON HALLOWEEN.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.842
YOU MEAN,
PERMANENT PERMANENT?

25:09.876 --> 25:10.710
INDEED.

25:10.743 --> 25:11.778
AND FOR MANY YEARS,

25:11.811 --> 25:15.948
IT WAS A FINE DETERRENT
UNTIL WE HAD A SMALL MISHAP.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.116
HOW SMALL?

25:17.149 --> 25:19.886
A SIMPLE MAGICAL
HOUSE CLEANING LESSON

25:19.919 --> 25:21.020
WENT HORRIBLY WRONG.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.991
HALF THE FRESHMAN CLASS HAD
TO BE SENT HOME AS TEACUPS.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.397
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED.

25:31.430 --> 25:35.167
I MEAN, I CAME
HERE TO LEARN HOW
TO BE A GREAT WHICH.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.135
LIKE YOU.

25:36.168 --> 25:40.306
MARNIE, YOU WILL LEARN
MORE ABOUT YOURSELF HERE

25:40.339 --> 25:42.675
THAN YOU EVER IMAGINED.

25:42.909 --> 25:46.278
WE ARE LATE
FOR YOUR NEXT CLASS.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.347
WE?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.149
[CHATTER IN BACKGROUND]

25:51.350 --> 25:54.253
GOOD. THE CLASS IS ALL HERE.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.256
BUT, UH,
NO CLASSROOM.

25:57.289 --> 26:02.629
ADAPPERIO PERPLEXIO.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.231
[EXCITED CHATTER]

26:08.367 --> 26:11.003
THIS IS THE OLD
CASTLE DUNGEON.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.204
IT'S USUALLY OFF-LIMITS,

26:12.238 --> 26:14.941
BUT THIS YEAR WE'VE
SELECTED A FEW OF YOU

26:14.974 --> 26:18.010
FOR A VERY SPECIAL
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY.

26:18.044 --> 26:21.280
YOU WILL SPEND THIS SEMESTER
UNEARTHING THE TREASURES

26:21.313 --> 26:24.250
OF A MILLENNIUM
OF HALLOWEENTOWN HISTORY

26:24.283 --> 26:26.252
BURIED BENEATH THIS CASTLE.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.688
3/4 OF YOUR GRADE
WILL BE BASED

26:28.721 --> 26:30.657
ON YOUR PERSONAL
DISCOVERIES HERE.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.358
YOU WILL BE SUPERVISED
IN YOUR WORK

26:32.391 --> 26:36.295
BY OUR OWN EXPERT
IN ALL THINGS HISTORICAL,

26:36.328 --> 26:38.364
DR. ICHABOD GROGG.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.100
THE FOSSIL HIMSELF.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.705
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME,
ISN'T HE?

26:45.738 --> 26:46.338
YEAH.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.106
1,000 YEARS AGO,

26:47.139 --> 26:49.308
THIS SCHOOL
WAS BUILT ON THE RUINS

26:49.341 --> 26:55.214
OF MISS PIPER'S
ANCESTRAL HOME,
CROMWELL CASTLE.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.252
I WILL INSTRUCT YOU ALL
IN THE MANUAL ARTS

27:00.286 --> 27:04.123
OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECOVERY
AND IDENTIFICATION.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.393
I EXPECT GREAT THINGS.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.796
PLEASE, GATHER AROUND.

27:10.329 --> 27:13.766
AT ANY ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
YOU WILL EVER ENCOUNTER,

27:13.800 --> 27:16.869
THESE ARE THE TOOLS
OF THE TRADE...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.640
BOO.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.745
YOU MUST BE SO CURIOUS
WHAT'S DOWN THERE.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.279
WHAT?
WHAT?

27:27.313 --> 27:30.382
PRICELESS
FAMILY HEIRLOOMS,
BURIED TREASURE.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.852
I'M JUST HERE TO LEARN
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

27:32.885 --> 27:36.022
OHH. BUT WE'RE NOT
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.256
YOU HEARD
WHAT GOODWYN SAID.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.959
WHAT WE FIND HERE
DETERMINES OUR GRADE.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.327
WE'RE WITCHES.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.461
WE HAVE POWERS

27:42.494 --> 27:43.595
WHICH WOULD BE UNFAIR TO USE.

27:43.629 --> 27:47.366
WHAT'S UNFAIR IS HAVING OUR
MAGIC BOTTLED UP LIKE THIS.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.135
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

27:49.168 --> 27:50.837
BUT MY FINGERS ARE
JUST ITCHING TO ZAP

27:50.870 --> 27:56.042
SOME NASTY OLD
CROMWELL ANTIQUES
OUT OF THAT HOLE.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.444
[GLASS BREAKS]

27:58.477 --> 27:59.411
EW.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.248
DR. GROGG,
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.183
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

28:10.890 --> 28:13.459
HA HA HA!

28:38.885 --> 28:41.053
"S. CROMWELL?"

28:41.553 --> 28:44.323
GADZOOKS.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.227
HOW DO I OPEN IT?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.296
USE A KEY?

28:50.830 --> 28:52.531
WHERE IS THE KEY?

28:52.564 --> 28:55.001
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.005
YOU JUST HAD
TO SHOW OFF.

28:59.038 --> 28:59.571
WHAT?

28:59.605 --> 29:01.340
YOU USED MAGIC IN CLASS.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.175
IT'S ALL OVER SCHOOL.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.143
YOU COULD BE EXPELLED.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.344
I DIDN'T USE MAGIC.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.813
TELL HIM, YOU GUYS,

29:06.846 --> 29:09.348
I DIDN'T USE MAGIC
TO DIG UP THAT BOX.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.350
SORRY, MARNIE, BUT
IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.253
YEAH, THE WHOLE
EARTH SHAKING BEAM
OF LIGHT THING.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.289
THE BOX LANDED
RIGHT IN YOUR HAND.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.290
BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

29:18.324 --> 29:22.228
IT JUST CAME TO ME LIKE
IT WANTED TO BE WITH ME.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.431
LIKE IT BELONGED TO ME.

29:30.169 --> 29:34.573
AND NOW, A READING
OF THE PROPHECY.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.108
"AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS,

29:36.142 --> 29:37.543
"AT THE CLOSE
OF THE FIRST MILLENNIUM

29:37.576 --> 29:39.445
"AT THE RISE
OF THE HALLOWEEN MOON.

29:39.478 --> 29:44.350
"A CROMWELL OF GREAT POWER
WILL EMBRACE THE GIFT.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.954
AND ALL THE WORLD WILL FIND
PEACE UNDER HER DOMINION."

29:47.987 --> 29:51.123
MARNIE PIPER IS A CROMWELL
OF THE PROPHECY.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.058
THE ONE WE HAVE WAITED FOR.

29:52.091 --> 29:55.194
AND I AM HAPPY TO REPORT
THE CHILD HAS FOUND

29:55.227 --> 29:58.564
THE ANCIENT BOX
WHICH CONTAINS THE GIFT.

29:58.597 --> 30:03.903
SOON WE WILL RULE
HALLOWEENTOWN.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.204
OR NOT.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.338
GIRLS.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.907
HI, DADDY.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.275
COME IN, COME IN.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.243
YOU HAVE MADE ME
SO PROUD.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.012
I HEARD HOW YOU LURED
THE PIPER GIRL

30:13.045 --> 30:16.415
INTO USING HER MAGIC
TO BRING FORTH THE BOX.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.183
WELL DONE.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.953
NOW, YOU MUST
GET HER TO OPEN IT.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.289
UH, YEAH.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.390
LISTEN.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.391
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE SO EASY.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.060
THIS MARNIE CHICK
IS SUPER TOUGH.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.195
SHE'S JUST
SO GOODY-GOODY.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.098
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
OPEN THE BOX, DADDY?

30:32.131 --> 30:35.267
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU'RE SUPER POWERFUL.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.468
SILENCE!

30:36.502 --> 30:40.006
ONLY A CROMWELL
MAY UNLEASH THE POWER.

30:40.039 --> 30:44.310
GROGG, PLEASE.

30:45.544 --> 30:49.548
HONEY, MARNIE PIPER
HAS TO OPEN THE BOX

30:49.581 --> 30:52.318
FOR THE PROPHECY
TO BE FULFILLED.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.385
OH.

30:53.419 --> 30:56.923
YEAH, BUT IF SHE
HAS TO USE MAGIC,
THERE'S NO WAY.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.290
GOODY-GOODY, REMEMBER?

30:58.324 --> 31:01.093
YEAH, SHE LIKE,
FOLLOWS THE RULES.

31:01.127 --> 31:04.163
THEN, WE MUST
WORK TOGETHER GIRLS.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.332
WE MUST TEMPT HER
TO BREAK THE RULES.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.903
SHE MUST
USE HER OWN MAGIC
TO OPEN THAT BOX.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.872
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.343
WHATEVER.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.314
[GROANING]

31:24.450 --> 31:26.352
UHH!

31:27.553 --> 31:29.488
THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE FOREVER.

31:29.521 --> 31:33.692
MAYBE I COULD JUST...

31:33.725 --> 31:35.661
NAH.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.464
[GASPS]

31:38.497 --> 31:40.599
DON'T DO THAT TO ME.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.300
I'M SORRY.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.102
I JUST--I HADN'T
HEARD FROM YOU

31:43.135 --> 31:45.304
AND I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.105
I'M FINE, MOM.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.474
DYLAN'S, DYLAN.
BUT HE'S FINE, TOO.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.142
WELL, GOOD.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.612
I'M FINE,
REALLY, I'M FINE.

31:53.645 --> 31:54.580
MOM, YOU CAN'T
DO THIS TO ME.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.416
I GET CAUGHT USING MAGIC,
I COULD BE EXPELLED.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.385
WHAT?
EXPELLED?

31:59.418 --> 32:03.022
SORRY, I JUST KNEW THAT
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.623
YOU KNEW I'D BE
DOING MY LAUNDRY?

32:04.656 --> 32:07.059
ARE YOU SPYING ON ME?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.327
NO.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.361
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

32:09.395 --> 32:10.329
I DID MY LAUNDRY
ON WEDNESDAYS, TOO.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.633
GREAT. I'LL BE EXPELLED
FOR BEING PREDICTABLE.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.104
MOM, DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM,

32:18.137 --> 32:19.405
SOME SILVER BOX?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.206
SILVER BOX.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.441
YEAH. IT'S ANCIENT
AND FILTHY AND...

32:22.474 --> 32:25.344
MAN, DOES
IT NEED WASHING.

32:26.045 --> 32:26.712
WAIT!

32:26.745 --> 32:29.315
I LOVE YOU!

32:29.348 --> 32:32.718
YEP, I LOVE THIS PLUMBING.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.454
IT'S REALLY GOOD PLUMBING.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.224
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.426
AM I SEEING WHAT
I THINK I'M SEEING?

32:40.459 --> 32:41.493
YES, MARNIE.

32:41.527 --> 32:45.197
YOU'VE SPOTTED THE ELUSIVE
GUY DOING HIS OWN LAUNDRY.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.666
A RARE CREATURE INDEED.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.538
SO, UH, YOU WANT TO JUST
ZAP THIS STUFF CLEAN

32:52.571 --> 32:55.107
AND GO GET A CUP
OF COFFEE WITH ME?

32:55.141 --> 32:59.245
I WAS JUST ACCUSED
OF USING MAGIC
WHEN I DIDN'T,

32:59.278 --> 33:00.479
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO BE ACCUSED

33:00.512 --> 33:01.613
OF USING MAGIC
WHEN I DID.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.483
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

33:04.516 --> 33:09.155
BUT, UH, YOU LOOKED
REALLY CUTE SAYING IT.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.157
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
USE YOUR MAGIC?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.325
WHAT MAGIC WOULD THAT BE?

33:13.359 --> 33:15.394
YOU KNOW...

33:16.428 --> 33:19.298
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
LAUNDRY ANYMORE, ARE WE?

33:19.331 --> 33:20.766
P.A.: MARNIE PIPER,

33:20.799 --> 33:23.435
MEET THE CHANCELLOR
AT THE DIG SITE.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.637
SORRY.

33:25.671 --> 33:29.508
CHANCELLOR REALLY NEEDS
TO GET A CELL PHONE.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.544
RAIN CHECK ON THE COFFEE?

33:32.578 --> 33:35.081
AND THE MAGIC.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.465
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

33:57.836 --> 33:58.837
LET'S OPEN IT.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.073
SMALL PROBLEM,
THERE'S NO KEY.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.709
PIFFLE. THAT'S WHAT
MAGIC IS FOR.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.444
ARE YOU KIDDING?

34:05.477 --> 34:07.313
I'M CHANCELLOR
OF THIS UNIVERSITY.

34:07.346 --> 34:11.150
IF I SAY IT'S OK,
THEN IT'S OK.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.452
IS THIS A TRAP?

34:13.485 --> 34:14.853
[LAUGHS]

34:14.886 --> 34:16.355
MARNIE.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.125
YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU'RE A WITCH,

34:19.158 --> 34:19.991
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

34:20.025 --> 34:25.431
DON'T HAVE TO TELL
ME TWICE, OR 3 TIMES.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.477
OPEN SESAME?

35:11.510 --> 35:14.546
OH, WELL THAT
WAS A BUST.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.817
GOODWYN ACTUALLY
ASKED YOU TO--

35:18.850 --> 35:19.785
SHH.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.687
USE MAGIC
TO OPEN THE BOX?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.190
YES, I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT

35:24.223 --> 35:25.491
BUT NOTHING WORKED.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.658
NADA.

35:26.692 --> 35:27.793
WHY DIDN'T SHE OPEN IT?

35:27.826 --> 35:30.196
SHE SAID IT
BELONGED TO A CROMWELL,

35:30.229 --> 35:31.930
SO ONLY A CROMWELL
COULD OPEN IT.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.599
IF ONLY I HAD THE KEY.

35:33.632 --> 35:38.437
HEY, YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU COULD DO
THAT SMOKY-SMOKY THING

35:38.470 --> 35:40.339
AND JUST TAKE
A PEAK INSIDE?

WITH MY OWN LAMP.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.879
S. CROMWELL WOULD KNOW
WHERE THE KEY IS.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.549
I WONDER WHAT THE S.
STANDS FOR, ANYWAY.

MY GRANDMA WOULD KNOW.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.719
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT HALLOWEENTOWN.

TALK TO HER.

WHERE SHE IS.

WHEN SHE IS.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.305
WELL, HELENA KNEW
HER BOYFRIEND WAS A JERK,

36:13.339 --> 36:14.806
BUT SHE LOVED HIM ANYWAY.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.408
ONLY BECAUSE THAT
FREAKY LITTLE FAIRY

36:16.442 --> 36:19.678

SPELL ON THEM.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.380
FAIRIES ARE NOT FREAKS.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.982
SORRY, I'M JUST
SAYING IT'S NOT LOVE

36:24.015 --> 36:25.751
IF HE'S FORCED
TO LIKE HER.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.686
MAYBE SHE LIKES
CONTROLLING HIM.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.489
BUT YOU DON'T CONTROL
SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.923
THAT WOULD
BE A NIGHTMARE,
NOT A DREAM.

A SUSAN OR A SARAH--

37:49.535 --> 37:50.502

37:50.536 --> 37:52.638
I WONDERED WHEN YOU WERE
GOING TO ASK ABOUT HER.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.441
I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT NAME IN YEARS.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.342
SO, YOU KNOW HER?

37:56.375 --> 37:59.311
OH, YES, I KNEW HER,

TO TELL ME SPLENDORA

ARE ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.573
UH, YEAH,
I CAUGHT THE THEME.

39:34.606 --> 39:38.477
ONE OF THEM HAS TO TELL US
WHO SPLENDORA CROMWELL WAS

IN THAT BOX.

I'M MAGIC.

USE THE "M" WORD?

MY POWERS FOR, I SWEAR.

47:46.564 --> 47:48.099
THANKS FOR
TAKING ME OUT.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.268
SOMEBODY NEEDED TO SAVE YOU
FROM ALL THAT DOODLING.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.670
YEAH, I'VE BEEN KIND OF
OBSESSED WITH THAT BOX

47:52.703 --> 47:54.172

48:07.318 --> 48:11.122
SO, MY PHYSICS TEST
IS, LIKE, TAKE HOME.

48:11.156 --> 48:11.990
LUCKY, HUH?

48:12.023 --> 48:14.592
AND MY SCIENCE ESSAY
HAS TO BE 500 WORDS.

48:14.625 --> 48:16.327
I ALREADY HAVE THE TITLE--

48:16.361 --> 48:20.331

THEY SO TOTALLY BORING?

48:20.365 --> 48:21.466
MARNIE, WAIT.

48:21.499 --> 48:22.200
Dylan: CLEVER.

48:22.233 --> 48:25.670
YOU'RE CUTE WHEN
YOU'RE THINKING.

48:25.703 --> 48:26.637
I CAN ALMOST SEE

48:26.671 --> 48:29.507
THE LITTLE TINY
GEARS GRINDING
IN YOUR HEAD.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.509
GET AWAY
FROM MY BROTHER.

48:31.542 --> 48:34.345
NO, DON'T GET AWAY.

48:34.379 --> 48:36.281
OH, RELAX, MOM.

48:36.314 --> 48:38.316
HE'S JUST DOING
SOME TUTORING.

48:38.349 --> 48:39.684
DID YOU JUST
CALL ME MOM?

48:39.717 --> 48:44.489
YES, SHE DID,
SO STOP ACTING LIKE HER.

48:45.023 --> 48:46.624
DYLAN, GET UP.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.459
NO.

48:48.493 --> 48:50.161
YOU TELL HER, DYLLY.

48:50.195 --> 48:51.329
DYLLY?

48:51.362 --> 48:55.033
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
ON MY BOOK REPORT NOW?

48:55.066 --> 48:56.067
YEAH, DYLLY?

48:56.101 --> 48:58.736
OK, WHAT DID
THEY USE, HMM?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.039
A LOVE POTION,
AN ADORATION AMULET?

49:01.072 --> 49:03.308

TO HELP US, REMEMBER?

49:03.341 --> 49:05.643
OK, HEX PENS ARE ONE THING,

49:05.676 --> 49:08.346
BUT HOW COULD YOU USE
MAGIC ON MY BROTHER?

49:08.379 --> 49:11.416
WE COULDN'T RISK
USING OUR OWN MAGIC
TO DO HOMEWORK.

49:11.449 --> 49:14.285
BESIDES, I WOULDN'T
CALL THIS MAGIC.

49:14.319 --> 49:17.322
REALLY, WHAT WOULD
YOU CALL IT?

49:17.355 --> 49:18.289
CHEATING.

49:18.323 --> 49:20.258
LET HIM GO.

49:23.328 --> 49:25.230
MAKE ME.

49:26.431 --> 49:30.001
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER
TO CONTROL ME, DO YOU?

49:31.202 --> 49:33.504
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

49:40.311 --> 49:43.381

49:49.354 --> 49:51.489

49:53.191 --> 49:55.293
HOW COULD THEY
DISAPPEAR THAT FAST?

49:55.326 --> 49:57.328
WITCHES.

49:58.096 --> 49:59.264
MARNIE, WAIT.

49:59.297 --> 50:03.368
THEY COULD BE
CASTING ANOTHER SPELL
ON DYLAN, AS WE SPEAK.

50:03.401 --> 50:04.469
TO MAKE HIM DO WHAT?

50:04.502 --> 50:07.505

HE LOVES MATH.

MY BROOM'S A SNAKE.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.726

51:02.527 --> 51:03.428
I THINK SHE SET US UP.

51:03.461 --> 51:04.729
I MEAN, SHE KNEW
WHERE WE'D BE,

51:04.762 --> 51:06.397
SHE KNEW WE'D
HAVE MY BROOM.

51:06.431 --> 51:07.598
YOU MEAN, SHE'S SPYING ON US?

51:07.632 --> 51:11.402

DOING IT FOR HER.

51:11.436 --> 51:13.171

YOU DOING?

IT'S A LONG WAY
BACK TO CAMPUS.

A VERY SPECIAL HALLOWEEN.

I AM JUST SO PRIVILEGED

51:53.444 --> 51:57.215
TO BE A CITIZEN
OF THIS GREAT BIG MAGICAL
WORLD OF OURS.

51:57.248 --> 52:01.819
OH, MAN, I PROMISED MYSELF
I WASN'T GOING TO CRY.

52:01.852 --> 52:02.820
All: AWW.

52:02.853 --> 52:06.123
THANK YOU.

52:07.692 --> 52:09.227
ARE YOU OK?

52:09.260 --> 52:10.060
OH, YEAH.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.202
I'M GOING TO CUT
YOU OFF, I SWEAR.

WHY DOESN'T MARNIE
JUST CAST A SPELL
TO STOP SCARLETT?

52:20.438 --> 52:21.239
SHE CAN'T.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.773
IT'S THE ONE POWER
WITCHES DON'T HAVE.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.210
THEY CAN'T COMPLETELY
CONTROL SOMEBODY ELSE.

52:25.243 --> 52:30.281
BUT THE SINISTER SISTER

DYLAN.

52:30.315 --> 52:31.249
NOT REALLY.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.850
THEY CAN'T MAKE HIM DO
SOMETHING HE'D NEVER DO.

DYLAN'S OWN DESIRES.

WE HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS
