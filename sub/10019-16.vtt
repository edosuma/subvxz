00:29.979 --> 00:32.947
- Mom?
- Oh, did I wake you?

00:34.044 --> 00:36.662
- What are you doing?
- I'm making you breakfast.

00:38.363 --> 00:39.956
Where's the coffee?

00:41.243 --> 00:45.040
- How are you feeling? Sleeping okay?
- Like a baby.

00:45.275 --> 00:47.861
- No nightmares?
- No.

00:48.571 --> 00:53.787
- It would only be natural.
- I see worse things at work every day.

00:55.451 --> 00:59.096
- Today's the big day, right?
- The test?

00:59.291 --> 01:01.179
No, find out about your job.

01:01.372 --> 01:05.266
They suspended me.
I might not get my job back.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.529
- Those eggs done?
- No, still too runny.

01:08.731 --> 01:13.074
- I like them runny.
- Just another couple of minutes.

01:13.275 --> 01:17.650
- What test?
- Medical school admissions test, Mom.

01:17.883 --> 01:22.259
- I thought you gave up on that.
- No.

01:22.427 --> 01:25.013
Big commitment.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.049
Here we go. Perfect.

01:34.235 --> 01:37.269
- Doctor. That would be something.
- I could do it.

01:37.467 --> 01:41.842
- I knew you could.
- Why do you always do that?

01:42.044 --> 01:44.978
Make me feel incapable, stupid.

01:45.180 --> 01:50.264
- I just said that you could do it.
- I wish you could believe in me.

01:50.492 --> 01:53.939
You're always criticizing me,
belittling me.

01:54.107 --> 01:56.955
Why didn't you tell me
I could be an astronaut?

01:57.116 --> 02:00.531
- Did you want to be that?
- I wanted you to tell me I could.

02:00.731 --> 02:02.673
Fine. Go be an astronaut.

02:04.571 --> 02:08.947
I'm your mother, I love you whoever
you are: Doctor, nurse, housewife.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.936
- Oh, right, housewife.
- You're the one that holds you back.

02:14.140 --> 02:18.395
You always quit things.
You never think you're good enough.

02:18.588 --> 02:22.810
- I finish things.
- Ballet, cheerleading, the flute.

02:23.003 --> 02:26.898
- I was 13!
- Business school, your own wedding.

02:31.707 --> 02:35.417
- I finished nursing school.
- Right. Exactly.

02:35.643 --> 02:39.353
You have a great job you're good at.
Why is the grass suddenly greener?

02:39.579 --> 02:45.427
I'm proud of you.
Why aren't you proud of yourself?

02:51.003 --> 02:53.556
Carla! Carla!

02:54.619 --> 03:00.118
I was coming to see you. I didn't
know you had to be at work this early.

03:00.283 --> 03:02.105
I don't.

03:03.804 --> 03:06.706
I'm sorry I haven't called.
A lot of stuff came up.

03:06.907 --> 03:10.355
I just had a lot of stuff going on.

03:10.587 --> 03:14.711
- I had a minor surgery and...
- Sorry to hear that. Are you okay?

03:14.907 --> 03:18.323
Yes. It was just my appendix.

03:18.523 --> 03:20.912
- What about you?
- What do you want?

03:21.115 --> 03:25.588
- We need to talk.
- I told you I was pregnant weeks ago.

03:25.788 --> 03:30.425
Then nothing. No phone calls,
no coming by to see how I was doing.

03:30.619 --> 03:32.180
I got the point.

03:33.787 --> 03:37.267
I wasn't trying to make a point!

03:38.939 --> 03:44.024
I realize there's going to be a baby,
and he will be my responsibility too.

03:45.019 --> 03:47.540
I just needed some time
to think about this.

03:47.739 --> 03:51.481
It's not the way I would've planned it,
but you're not doing this alone.

03:51.708 --> 03:55.221
- Are you going to marry me, Peter?
- That's not what I'm saying.

03:55.419 --> 03:59.991
What are you saying?
Are you going to stop by...

04:00.188 --> 04:05.141
...and change some nappies
and stay for some Kodak moments?

04:05.307 --> 04:09.431
The child will need a good school
and a nice place to live.

04:09.659 --> 04:12.855
- Can't I provide that?
- I can help, Carla.

04:13.019 --> 04:16.216
Money.
So that is what this is all about.

04:16.442 --> 04:18.615
Yes. That among other things.

04:18.810 --> 04:21.113
The child will need a man in his life.

04:21.308 --> 04:24.723
Who says the baby
will not have a man in its life?

04:26.203 --> 04:28.920
Are you seeing somebody else?

04:30.108 --> 04:35.225
Peter, you and I have known
each other for a very long time.

04:35.419 --> 04:39.991
I never expected you to marry me. I
never expected a damn thing from you.

04:40.156 --> 04:44.116
You care about you. And that is
the way it's always going to be.

04:44.347 --> 04:48.570
But it's comforting, really. It's one
of the few constants in my life.

04:49.979 --> 04:52.499
Don't worry.
This baby is going to be fine.

04:52.699 --> 04:57.107
Plenty to eat, nice clothes, a man
to call dad. I'll take care of that.

04:57.307 --> 05:01.584
You go back to worrying about yourself.
That's what you do best.

05:55.196 --> 05:59.636
Dr. Benton! First day back.
How's the incision healing?

05:59.835 --> 06:03.894
- I'm fine, Carter.
- You shouldn't be back yet.

06:04.091 --> 06:06.676
Have you finished
the whole course of antibiotics?

06:06.875 --> 06:08.435
Hi, Peter, how's the scar?

06:08.667 --> 06:12.529
I made a Rocky-Davis incision,
running stitch, McBurney's point.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.155
When the hair grows back,
the itching starts.

06:15.387 --> 06:17.973
You're going to show us your scar,
Peter? Let's see!

06:18.171 --> 06:21.019
Yes, let's take a look.
I did it one-handed.

06:21.211 --> 06:25.521
- Stop, Carter!
- That's a shame. It's a great job.

06:26.363 --> 06:28.819
Good thing I took pictures.

06:30.267 --> 06:34.228
- What is that, a mole?
- Good morning. What are you doing?

06:34.427 --> 06:39.249
- Good God, what is that?
- Benton's appendix in a jar.

06:39.451 --> 06:42.834
- Wow, they shaved him good.
- Dr. Carter...

06:43.035 --> 06:46.712
...we're still backed up.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.590
- Carter looks beat.
- He was on again last night.

06:49.787 --> 06:52.470
Surgical interns still cover
Dr. Gant's shifts.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.187
- Sounds like a 90-hour week.
- More like 95.

06:55.355 --> 06:57.690
Thank God for Pediatrics.

07:00.155 --> 07:01.879
What is that all about?

07:02.075 --> 07:05.424
Nurses and management are still at the
table. Contract expires at midnight.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.205
Mark, paramedics are pulling up with a
female, 35, respiratory failure.

07:09.403 --> 07:12.371
- Duty calls. Hey, lunch?
- Lf you're buying.

07:12.571 --> 07:13.978
- Carol's back today?
- Yes.

07:14.235 --> 07:16.952
Investigation is done,
Nursing has the report.

07:17.115 --> 07:19.897
- Have you seen it?
- No.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.229
- How's she doing?
- She says she's fine.

07:22.459 --> 07:25.874
Okay, Jeff, thanks.
Nothing yet. They're still at it.

07:26.043 --> 07:29.654
- I don't want to walk a picket line.
- Not in February.

07:29.851 --> 07:33.331
- We stay firm.
- Easy for you to say.

07:33.563 --> 07:36.979
They'll settle.
They can't run the place without us.

07:37.179 --> 07:40.889
That's what the air traffic controllers
said before parking cars for a living.

07:41.115 --> 07:43.057
One, two, three.

07:43.259 --> 07:46.227
Down's patient, 37. Found in bed
with respiratory distress.

07:46.459 --> 07:48.401
Resps shallow at 30. BP's 100/50.

07:48.539 --> 07:51.572
Mom said she's had an infection,
but she never fully recovered.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.316
- Where's the mother now?
- She followed in her car.

07:55.515 --> 07:57.751
Two-plus pitting edema!

07:57.979 --> 08:02.005
Louise, I'm Doctor Greene.
You have a little trouble breathing?

08:02.203 --> 08:04.145
We're going to make you feel better.

08:04.315 --> 08:06.998
She's scared.
She held my hand all the way.

08:08.891 --> 08:13.266
Louise, can you tell me what day
it is? You can't tell me.

08:13.467 --> 08:16.217
Dr. Doyle, can you take a listen?

08:16.411 --> 08:19.640
- Chuny, come and hold Louise's hand.
- You bet.

08:19.835 --> 08:24.145
CBC, lytes, EKG, chest
film, O-2, 6 liters by mask.

08:24.315 --> 08:26.289
Hi, Louise. My name is Chuny.

08:26.491 --> 08:31.576
S3 gallop and mitral regurg?
Possible cardiomyopathy.

08:31.803 --> 08:35.349
- Mark, she's trying to say something.
- Louise...

08:36.602 --> 08:39.221
...do you need something?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.799
- What's wrong?
- Where's my mom?

08:43.995 --> 08:47.890
Your mom is coming real soon. Okay?

08:48.091 --> 08:51.921
Don't worry. You can just relax.
You're doing great.

08:52.795 --> 08:56.854
Human Resources reviewed your
incident report in ER procedures.

08:57.051 --> 09:01.207
They passed our recommendations
to the Safety Committee.

09:01.435 --> 09:04.218
- And?
- They agreed with us.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.957
Your mistake was a result of systems
problems and not negligence.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.611
There will be a written warning
in your file for a year.

09:10.811 --> 09:14.772
The three weeks you missed will be
deducted from your vacation time.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.200
- That's it?
- You preferred a public flogging?

09:18.427 --> 09:20.882
You can start back today.

09:24.251 --> 09:28.528
- You don't have to start back today.
- No, thanks. I'm okay.

09:31.419 --> 09:35.031
I better get back to work.

09:36.923 --> 09:40.272
<i>- La Boh áme</i>!
- You make it sound like a bacteria.

09:40.475 --> 09:44.501
- What is it? Like five hours long?
- Forget it.

09:44.699 --> 09:48.627
I'm not an opera fan. Marcus Roberts
tickets on the contrary...

09:48.827 --> 09:51.577
I got it, Greg.
You don't want to go. Fine.

09:51.771 --> 09:55.284
Is <i>La Boh áme</i> the one where they lop
off the nuns' heads at the end?

09:55.483 --> 09:59.378
It's set in Paris. There's
star-crossed lovers and artists.

09:59.579 --> 10:03.157
Jeanie, hang on.
If you want to go, we'll go.

10:03.323 --> 10:05.712
- Don't do me any favors.
- I'd love to go.

10:05.947 --> 10:08.795
I just thought we could do
something spontaneous.

10:08.955 --> 10:11.027
- Opera?
- I have to get back to my patient.

10:11.259 --> 10:16.856
Let's hang out anyway. We'll order
food. Watch the Bulls-Warriors game.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.026
You think you're charming,
but you're not.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.969
Lunch then?
Please let me buy you lunch. Jeanie!

10:23.195 --> 10:26.490
- That's one boggy heart.
- It's taking up most of her chest.

10:26.715 --> 10:30.327
EKG shows ST and T wave changes.
What do you want to do?

10:30.491 --> 10:33.011
Get an echo and page Cardiology.

10:34.651 --> 10:39.092
- Mark, Louise's mother is here.
- Hi, Mrs. Cupertino, I'm Mark Greene.

10:39.323 --> 10:40.883
- How's Louise?
- Not good.

10:41.083 --> 10:44.214
Her heart isn't pumping well,
and her lungs are filling with fluid.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.450
- Can I say hello?
- Yes, sure.

10:49.243 --> 10:53.466
- Hello, Louise. It's Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy.

10:53.658 --> 10:56.724
Are you okay?
You're not scared, are you?

10:59.803 --> 11:02.585
I brought some of her things.

11:04.379 --> 11:09.561
Just to make her feel more at home.
I'll just put this quilt on her.

11:10.139 --> 11:14.808
- Make sure she's good and warm.
- Mrs. Cupertino, can I speak to you?

11:22.395 --> 11:25.112
She had trouble understanding me.
Can she communicate?

11:25.307 --> 11:28.209
Oh, yes. She likes to talk.

11:28.411 --> 11:31.378
Is she suffering
from any dementia or Alzheimer's?

11:31.547 --> 11:34.198
No, she's a good girl.

11:34.395 --> 11:37.177
Echo's on its way.

11:37.403 --> 11:39.607
Is she competent to make her own
medical decisions?

11:39.803 --> 11:43.447
No. I'm her guardian. Louise can't
make decisions on her own.

11:43.643 --> 11:47.439
You are aware that Louise's condition
is very serious.

11:47.643 --> 11:52.215
Louise may need a heart transplant.
Is she on the waiting list?

11:52.411 --> 11:55.575
- The list? No.
- She's not?

11:55.771 --> 11:58.804
They wouldn't put her on the list.

11:59.003 --> 12:02.647
They wouldn't put Louise
on the heart transplant waiting list?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.798
My daughter is
mentally retarded, doctor.

12:10.683 --> 12:13.716
Peter, sorry to keep you waiting.

12:13.946 --> 12:16.881
Welcome back. We've missed you.

12:17.082 --> 12:20.181
I was surprised not to see my name
on today's schedule.

12:20.379 --> 12:23.412
- How are you feeling? Well rested?
- Yes.

12:23.611 --> 12:28.051
And mentally? Feeling sharp?
No post-operative depression?

12:28.283 --> 12:31.000
- No.
- No depression of any kind?

12:32.251 --> 12:36.920
Dr. Hicks, if you're asking if I can
perform my duties adequately, I can.

12:37.082 --> 12:39.570
I'm asking how you are, Peter.

12:42.907 --> 12:47.379
- I'm fine.
- Okay, then, let's see what we've got.

12:47.579 --> 12:52.183
It's two Port-A-Caths, a circumcision
and nevus removal.

12:52.379 --> 12:53.808
A mole?

12:54.010 --> 12:56.628
They can't refuse to put her on
the list because she has Down's.

12:56.827 --> 13:01.464
- There must be other circumstances.
- She's a retard, so why bother.

13:03.162 --> 13:05.813
Dr. Kayson. Dr. Doyle.

13:06.490 --> 13:11.411
Echo shows left ventricular dilatation
with an ejection fraction of 18%.

13:11.611 --> 13:13.977
There are also
signs of wall-motion abnormality.

13:14.139 --> 13:15.895
I'm worried about her breathing.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.774
We've given her 40 Lasix,
she's still struggling.

13:18.970 --> 13:21.109
- I'd like to try a vasodilator.
- Sure.

13:21.339 --> 13:24.568
Do whatever you can to make her
comfortable before you release her.

13:24.730 --> 13:27.698
She will be a lot happier
at home with her mother.

13:27.931 --> 13:30.581
She needs a heart transplant, right?

13:30.779 --> 13:32.950
That would be
the standard operative course, yes.

13:33.147 --> 13:38.100
Louise's mother told us
that she's not on the transplant list.

13:38.330 --> 13:41.843
UNOS can't refuse to put a patient
on the list because of a birth defect.

13:41.979 --> 13:45.328
- UNOS didn't refuse, we did.
- Cardiology?

13:45.531 --> 13:49.808
Hospital Transplant Committee. We
chose not to submit her name to UNOS.

13:50.042 --> 13:52.530
That's a death sentence.

13:52.730 --> 13:56.178
She's a 37-year-old Down's patient.
She is lucky to have lived this long.

13:56.347 --> 13:59.543
- Down's patients can live to be 60.
- That's extremely rare.

13:59.771 --> 14:01.975
- What are you, an intern?
- First-year resident.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.505
Why don't we step in here?

14:09.275 --> 14:15.505
Dr. Kayson, Dr. Doyle's expressing
a frustration I think we all feel.

14:15.707 --> 14:19.002
Louise is an obvious candidate
for the UNOS transplant list.

14:19.162 --> 14:22.261
I'm a cardiologist. I'd like nothing
better than to give her a new heart.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.490
If you have a problem with the
decision, speak to the committee.

14:25.691 --> 14:29.007
Short of that, send her home.

14:31.322 --> 14:33.711
Nice guy.

14:36.603 --> 14:38.741
- Carol, are you back?
- Yes.

14:38.939 --> 14:43.030
Thank you, Jesus.
Hey, you all, Carol's back.

14:43.227 --> 14:45.594
- Carol, you're back.
- Starting now.

14:45.755 --> 14:49.464
- We've missed you.
- Thought we'd never make it.

14:50.778 --> 14:53.145
- Did they dock your pay?
- No, just some vacation time.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.600
- It's been a disaster without you.
- A complete zoo.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.691
- I didn't do that bad a job.
- No, you did worse than that.

15:00.923 --> 15:03.443
Call union meetings after work, Haleh.

15:03.643 --> 15:06.676
- Carol's back.
- Oh, thank God.

15:06.875 --> 15:10.388
- We'll talk to you at lunch.
- We'll catch up later.

15:11.419 --> 15:15.379
We're glad to have you back.
Are you okay?

15:15.515 --> 15:20.882
I'm sorry to disappoint everyone's
expectations, but I'm fine.

15:21.115 --> 15:23.897
It started a few hours ago
after breakfast.

15:24.122 --> 15:28.148
- Is it a sharp pain?
- No. Sort of all over.

15:28.315 --> 15:32.057
- I just started my morning walk.
- Any recent illness?

15:32.283 --> 15:36.952
I take digoxin for atrial fibril...
I can never say that word.

15:37.178 --> 15:40.178
- Fibrillation. Anything else?
- No.

15:40.379 --> 15:43.695
- What did you have for breakfast?
- The usual.

15:43.930 --> 15:48.207
Three fried eggs, bacon,
glass of buttermilk, toast and jam.

15:48.346 --> 15:50.834
The American Heart Association
breakfast.

15:51.035 --> 15:55.257
Don't lecture me. My mother had
the same every day in her life.

15:55.483 --> 15:59.160
She died last year at 96.
Car accident.

16:00.602 --> 16:02.871
- Vitals?
- 130/90.

16:03.067 --> 16:07.736
- Heart rate, 110. Resps, 24.
- Did Dr. Weaver get a CBC?

16:07.963 --> 16:11.061
Yes. Crit's 53. White count is 12.2.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.735
- You drink enough fluids?
- Is that what's wrong with me?

16:17.242 --> 16:21.498
- Too early to tell. Chest film?
- Not back yet.

16:23.706 --> 16:27.962
I'm going to call for a surgical
colleague to come and take a look.

16:28.539 --> 16:30.099
Her breathing's improved.

16:31.194 --> 16:34.543
Hey, Louise, feeling better?

16:35.738 --> 16:39.034
- For you.
- She likes to share.

16:39.226 --> 16:43.318
- Malibu Barbie was my favorite too.
- I was more partial to Ken.

16:43.514 --> 16:46.067
- You don't like Ken?
- Too pretty.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.186
I'm with you. Ken is trouble.

16:48.347 --> 16:53.104
Louise, can you hold on to her
while I do my work?

16:53.274 --> 16:58.195
She misses her friends since she got
sick and had to move back home.

16:58.395 --> 17:01.711
- She had her own place?
- An apartment above the garage.

17:01.946 --> 17:06.103
And she had a job at the Jewel
helping people with their groceries.

17:07.194 --> 17:11.733
Father even let her be an altar girl
at the church. Everybody loves her.

17:11.962 --> 17:15.223
Excuse me, Dr. Greene.
I got that list from upstairs.

17:17.242 --> 17:18.453
Thanks.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.484
Transplant Committee?
Who are the bastards?

17:23.611 --> 17:25.617
Excuse us.

17:25.819 --> 17:29.048
Your attitudes can get in the way
of achieving your goals.

17:29.211 --> 17:32.789
You're not going to vote for me
for homecoming queen this year?

17:34.619 --> 17:37.074
Like that, you mean.

17:37.274 --> 17:39.282
- Recognize any names?
- One.

17:41.114 --> 17:45.904
- The vanquished return victorious.
- Hey, Doug, you miss me?

17:46.106 --> 17:48.626
You have no idea. I heard they
clipped you for some vacation time.

17:48.827 --> 17:51.827
I never take it anyway. I think
I have a couple of years saved up.

17:52.026 --> 17:54.033
This place is a mess.
How are you doing?

17:54.235 --> 17:57.104
No complaints.
Today is the 20th, isn't it?

17:57.307 --> 18:01.104
- I think so.
- MCATs are this afternoon.

18:01.307 --> 18:02.900
- Are you going?
- Got to work.

18:03.098 --> 18:07.768
- All that saved-up vacation time?
- It was a stupid idea.

18:07.963 --> 18:12.240
Four years of med school
if I ever get in. All that debt.

18:12.411 --> 18:15.542
I would be 50 by the time I got out.
What's the point?

18:15.770 --> 18:19.796
I could bring you coffee in the middle
of the night to the med library.

18:19.995 --> 18:24.435
I could teach you how to cheat
on the biochem exams.

18:24.635 --> 18:27.701
- Doug. They need you at Pedes.
- Okay.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.516
Think about it.

18:30.682 --> 18:33.584
- Carter, where have you been?
- Getting some food. Do you have a spoon?

18:33.818 --> 18:36.786
No. Anspaugh's in there with
your patient. Said you paged him.

18:36.986 --> 18:40.728
- I paged Dr. Hicks.
- You got Anspaugh and the rounds.

18:40.955 --> 18:44.184
- What do you hear, Edson?
- Rales at the base of the lungs.

18:44.378 --> 18:48.688
I'm sorry to have dragged you down
here, I paged Dr. Hicks for a consult.

18:48.891 --> 18:52.469
Dr. Hicks is in surgery, and we were
on the prowl for an interesting case.

18:52.666 --> 18:57.587
- We heard you had a surgical abdomen.
- That's my suspicion.

18:57.818 --> 19:02.357
Pain vague and diffuse,
very little tenderness to palpation.

19:02.522 --> 19:08.403
Chest films show bibasilar effusions.

19:08.603 --> 19:10.992
Rales heard on auscultation.

19:11.194 --> 19:13.877
Would you consider this
a surgical patient, Dr. Edson?

19:14.074 --> 19:17.751
- No, I'd bet on CHF.
- Yes, but...

19:17.947 --> 19:20.248
...I was more concerned with the CBC.

19:22.234 --> 19:26.774
Previously diagnosed
with atrial fibrillation? Her diet?

19:26.970 --> 19:32.437
I'd assume that she went into fib
or ate a salty meal.

19:32.603 --> 19:36.432
And that was enough to push her into
congestive heart failure...

19:36.634 --> 19:39.001
...demonstrated by the rales
and chest effusions.

19:39.227 --> 19:44.497
The diffuse abdominal pain is probably
due to congestion in the liver.

19:44.698 --> 19:50.132
In other words, congestive heart
failure secondary to a-fib.

19:51.034 --> 19:56.599
- Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Carter?
- Yes, that sounds about right.

19:56.794 --> 19:59.729
Is Dr. Pomerantz available?
I'm Mark Greene from the ER.

19:59.962 --> 20:03.824
- Does she know you?
- Yes, Steph, I do. Hi.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.685
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

20:07.546 --> 20:10.099
Just move those,
put them anywhere.

20:11.642 --> 20:12.787
What can I do for you?

20:12.986 --> 20:17.263
You're on the committee that evaluates
prospective transplant patients?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.670
I have a dying patient,
Louise Cupertino.

20:19.866 --> 20:23.860
Dr. Kayson tells me that she was
denied access to the UNOS list.

20:24.058 --> 20:28.182
Kayson made it sound like she wasn't
excluded for medical reasons.

20:28.379 --> 20:31.378
- What do you want?
- Kayson said yes.

20:31.610 --> 20:35.091
If I can get you and another person to
sign on, Louise can get a new heart.

20:35.226 --> 20:37.909
Our decisions must be unanimous.

20:38.106 --> 20:41.652
But I'm the one
that turned Louise down.

20:41.850 --> 20:46.040
Do you know how many people die
each year because of lack of organs?

20:46.267 --> 20:49.812
- 3500.
- She had a job, an apartment.

20:50.011 --> 20:54.833
Is her life less worthy than a smoking
businessman with wife and kids?

20:55.034 --> 20:57.904
Don't patronize me.
I agonized over this.

20:58.106 --> 21:01.718
Louise has an IQ of 40. She can't
comprehend the surgical risks.

21:01.914 --> 21:06.736
She had a job, but she was always
late. She can't tell the time.

21:06.906 --> 21:09.972
How is she going to adhere to the
rigors of the post-transplant regime?

21:10.202 --> 21:12.788
Her mother will make sure she gets her
meds, get her where she needs to go.

21:12.986 --> 21:15.091
She's a 120-pound 8-year-old.

21:15.258 --> 21:19.055
We do the operation, and assuming
she doesn't die for lack of care...

21:19.258 --> 21:21.233
...she's in a state home in two years.

21:21.466 --> 21:25.328
And her mother's adamant
she not end up in a home.

21:39.898 --> 21:45.430
Those are logical reasons we give
ourselves so we can sleep at night.

21:45.626 --> 21:51.256
Louise can make people smile, she can
laugh and cry and hold someone.

21:51.482 --> 21:53.751
I have an 8-year-old.
If she never grew a day older...

21:53.914 --> 21:57.908
...I would still cherish every moment
we've spent together.

21:58.138 --> 22:01.750
It's not our place to decide
whether Louise lives or dies.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.078
She has as much right to be here
as you do or I do.

22:06.938 --> 22:09.720
Nina, don't let her die.

22:15.514 --> 22:17.969
- I'm freezing.
- I thought you liked picnics.

22:18.170 --> 22:23.255
I love picnics. I'm just not used to
having to thaw my sandwich first.

22:23.450 --> 22:26.679
Where's your sense of spontaneity
and romance?

22:26.875 --> 22:28.980
- This dip is frozen solid.
- It's a p ðt Á.

22:29.178 --> 22:31.000
It's a brick.

22:35.002 --> 22:38.614
Okay, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
You're very romantic.

22:38.810 --> 22:41.395
You're very spontaneous and crazy.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.569
Please put your parka on
before you freeze to death.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.488
- I'm fine.
- You can't be fine. It's 10 degrees.

22:47.930 --> 22:50.713
I think we should
start sleeping together.

22:52.058 --> 22:53.945
- What?
- Sex.

22:55.130 --> 23:00.847
I think we should have some. In fact,
I think we should have a lot.

23:02.714 --> 23:06.870
- Are you sure?
- Hell, yes, I'm sure.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.253
This isn't a joke, Greg.

23:11.995 --> 23:15.224
No, it isn't. Jeanie Boulet...

23:17.274 --> 23:19.663
...would you please sleep with me?

23:34.458 --> 23:37.939
- How is she?
- Her breathing is worse.

23:38.138 --> 23:41.007
- How is the pain?
- It hurts.

23:41.210 --> 23:44.210
- Hi, who are you?
- Her daughter, Yolanda.

23:44.442 --> 23:48.086
She's so stoic. If she says it hurts,
it must be awful.

23:49.082 --> 23:51.569
Oh, God!

23:51.770 --> 23:54.617
Let me do a repeat CBC
and a blood gas.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.592
- Do you want to page Anspaugh?
- No.

23:57.818 --> 24:03.318
Call Dr. Hicks. Tell her that I need
her down here right away.

24:03.482 --> 24:07.224
My fianc Áe has been begging me
for years to get this thing off.

24:07.482 --> 24:10.831
- Betadine.
- I'm not very religious, but...

24:11.034 --> 24:16.915
...her family wouldn't even consider
the marriage if I didn't convert.

24:18.906 --> 24:20.597
It's cold.

24:20.794 --> 24:25.366
I wouldn't have started dating her
if I knew this was part of the deal.

24:25.530 --> 24:29.556
Lidocaine. You'll feel a small prick
in the area to be anesthetized.

24:29.786 --> 24:32.885
- Please don't move.
- Good, you haven't started yet.

24:33.050 --> 24:36.366
I have three eager pre-med students
from Evanston.

24:36.602 --> 24:39.733
I thought they might enjoy watching
you perform a circumcision.

24:39.930 --> 24:45.298
- Don't mind us, sir.
- I'm converting to Judaism.

24:45.498 --> 24:49.459
- Dr. Hicks, phone call from the ER.
- Make them feel welcome.

24:49.690 --> 24:52.592
You're in very capable hands.

24:52.762 --> 24:54.966
Number 15 blade.

24:56.090 --> 25:01.719
- I'm Dr. Ross. Someone paged me?
- I paged you. Samantha Ewing.

25:01.914 --> 25:04.532
I've got a CF kid up here,
Jad Heuston. Know him?

25:04.730 --> 25:08.439
He's been on a respirator for some
weeks on his mother's request.

25:08.666 --> 25:11.600
Today's his 18th birthday,
and he wants off.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.802
- Why page me?
- He wants you to do it.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.832
Hi, Norma. Hi, Katy.

25:21.530 --> 25:22.675
Happy birthday, Jad.

25:22.842 --> 25:27.217
His first act as an adult was to ask
to be removed from the respirator.

25:27.418 --> 25:29.622
I explained the dangers,
but he insisted.

25:29.850 --> 25:31.890
Are you still sure?

25:32.090 --> 25:36.498
The nature of his disease and
the time he's been on the machine...

25:36.698 --> 25:40.211
...may cause him to die after some
minutes. Can you talk to him?

25:40.410 --> 25:42.035
What's his tidal volume?

25:42.202 --> 25:46.064
350. PCO-2, 38. PO-2, 120.

25:46.298 --> 25:48.982
Is this what you really want?

25:49.178 --> 25:52.113
Have you said your goodbyes?

25:52.314 --> 25:54.322
Yes.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.371
Okay.

26:02.362 --> 26:05.428
All right, buddy. You know the drill.

26:05.658 --> 26:08.527
I'm going to count to three.
You're going to take a deep breath.

26:08.730 --> 26:12.113
You're going to blow out while I pull.
Can you give me a hand with this?

26:18.554 --> 26:20.921
I love you.

26:21.882 --> 26:25.559
All right. Here we go.
On three. Ready?

26:25.754 --> 26:30.162
One, two, three.
Blow, blow, blow.

26:44.506 --> 26:46.328
Is he going to be okay?

26:57.530 --> 27:00.825
Good afternoon.
What could be so important?

27:01.018 --> 27:04.367
64-year-old woman. Onset
of abdominal pain five hours ago.

27:04.538 --> 27:07.385
Pain was vague and diffuse.
Belly wasn't too tender.

27:07.578 --> 27:10.993
Takes digoxin for a previously
diagnosed atrial fib. Rales.

27:11.194 --> 27:14.096
Chest x-ray shows basilar
infiltrates bilaterally.

27:14.298 --> 27:17.397
Dr. Anspaugh was here, and he
diagnosed congestive heart failure...

27:17.626 --> 27:21.750
...diffuse abdominal pain due to
congestion in liver secondary to CHF.

27:21.946 --> 27:26.103
- We gave her 40 of Lasix.
- Good story. What's the problem?

27:27.226 --> 27:30.838
- I think Dr. Anspaugh is wrong.
- Page Dr. Anspaugh, please.

27:31.002 --> 27:35.224
- He's still at lunch with Weaver.
- Quickly.

27:35.418 --> 27:37.360
You have a better story.

27:37.594 --> 27:41.042
Her abdominal pain is worsening.
Resps are 39, and she's acidotic.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.439
When she came in, she was dehydrated.
So why's fluid on her lungs?

27:44.634 --> 27:48.344
The pain isn't explained by congestive
heart failure. It doesn't add up.

27:48.570 --> 27:52.312
- And what is your thinking?
- She suffers from atrial fibrillation.

27:52.538 --> 27:55.636
That puts her at risk for developing
clots. She threw an embolus...

27:55.834 --> 27:58.681
...and it's blocking her small bowel.
- What is going on?

27:58.874 --> 28:02.998
Dr. Carter believes that you diagnosed
his patient incorrectly.

28:03.162 --> 28:05.780
Pain is worsening, resps are
up to 39 and she's acidotic.

28:05.978 --> 28:10.288
CHF made sense earlier, but I think she
has ischemic small bowel disease...

28:10.522 --> 28:13.369
...secondary to an embolism
in the mesenteric artery.

28:13.530 --> 28:17.076
- Pretty good story.
- Damn it! I diuresed her.

28:17.306 --> 28:21.648
Normal saline, 200 cc's per hour.
Call the O.R., we're moving her now.

28:21.850 --> 28:25.112
- What's happening?
- Your mother needs an operation.

28:25.306 --> 28:27.695
She's going to be just fine.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.152
- Dr. Anspaugh, can I assist?
- You're going to do it.

28:31.321 --> 28:33.012
- Perform an embolectomy?
- Yes.

28:33.241 --> 28:37.649
You're the only one here who seems
to know what they're doing.

28:37.818 --> 28:40.371
- It's going to fall.
- No, it's not.

28:40.538 --> 28:42.993
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

28:44.154 --> 28:47.700
- She looks like she's feeling better.
- Yes, she ate a little bit.

28:47.930 --> 28:50.101
- Seems to be breathing okay.
- Who's her friend?

28:50.298 --> 28:54.040
My brother. Mom brought him down,
I figured Louise needed some company.

28:54.265 --> 28:57.877
Hey, Jimmy, say hello to Dr. Greene.
He's my boss.

28:58.074 --> 29:01.205
- Hi, Jimmy, how are you?
- What did they say?

29:03.513 --> 29:04.888
Come here.

29:07.834 --> 29:10.769
Psych doesn't think she can
handle post-op regime...

29:10.937 --> 29:13.654
...and that the mother will be around
long enough to get her through it.

29:13.850 --> 29:16.217
That's a lot of crap.
She can go to a group home.

29:16.441 --> 29:20.631
- Jimmy takes classes out of Glenkirk.
- Mom doesn't want her in a home.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.695
She has guardianship.
I called Loyola and Rush.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.726
They both have transplant centers.
Maybe they can get her on the list.

29:29.498 --> 29:33.175
- Mark.
- Dr. Doyle, this is Dr. Pomerantz...

29:33.369 --> 29:36.151
...from Psych.
She's the one that evaluated Louise.

29:36.378 --> 29:39.411
Hi, Louise. How are you doing?

29:39.546 --> 29:41.967
Mrs. Cupertino.

29:43.354 --> 29:46.354
- She's doing better.
- She's out of heart failure.

29:46.522 --> 29:49.904
You need to fill this out. Transplant
candidate registration form.

29:50.138 --> 29:53.269
She can't get on the network without
it. Kayson filled out most of it.

29:53.433 --> 29:57.940
I need today's history so that I can
rank her. Get it back to me soon.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.296
Nice meeting you.

30:05.817 --> 30:06.963
Nina...

30:08.314 --> 30:10.550
...thank you.

30:14.074 --> 30:16.791
Jad, why don't you come and go?

30:16.985 --> 30:19.920
You take off during the day
and do what you want to do...

30:20.090 --> 30:22.839
...and when you come back,
we hook you up with IV antibiotics.

30:23.034 --> 30:25.718
We get a PT to pound your chest
in the morning.

30:25.946 --> 30:29.840
- No, thanks.
- It's a lot more comfortable.

30:30.042 --> 30:34.482
You might even squeak out a couple
of extra weeks out of this thing.

30:34.682 --> 30:36.591
I said no, thanks.

30:39.802 --> 30:42.737
All right. Here is my beeper number.

30:42.874 --> 30:47.663
That's my home number. You can
call me anytime, day or night.

30:53.498 --> 30:55.091
Let's go.

31:08.313 --> 31:09.524
Thanks.

31:13.146 --> 31:16.375
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

31:36.282 --> 31:38.104
Sorry, Dr. Ross.

31:38.298 --> 31:41.527
I raided the cafeteria.
Bought every cake they had.

31:41.721 --> 31:43.544
Ladies! Here's your cake.

31:46.617 --> 31:49.334
- What's going on?
- The nurses got their new contract.

31:49.530 --> 31:51.864
- Did they get what they asked for?
- Current employees are protected...

31:52.058 --> 31:56.880
...but the hospital wants to replace
RNs with unlicensed technicians.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.983
- Technicians?
- It's the wave of the future.

32:00.217 --> 32:03.185
- Come on, doctor. Dance.
- No, thanks.

32:03.385 --> 32:07.957
No, I'll get the next song.
Have you seen Carol?

32:08.154 --> 32:10.575
She changed her mind
and went home before lunch.

32:10.809 --> 32:13.711
- I'm starving. Want a piece of cake?
- No, thanks.

32:17.689 --> 32:21.202
Hey, I just dropped off all the
paperwork with Nina Pomerantz.

32:21.402 --> 32:25.679
Louise will be on the transplant list
tomorrow. All we can do is wait.

32:25.850 --> 32:29.778
- Where's your brother?
- In the lounge watching TV.

32:30.009 --> 32:34.613
Louise's mother won't sign
the surgical release.

32:34.809 --> 32:38.486
Kayson was just here. She doesn't
want Louise to have the transplant.

32:38.682 --> 32:41.137
Did he explain that she will die
without the transplantation?

32:41.337 --> 32:45.615
Twice. Then I tried.
She wants to take her home.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.679
Mrs. Cupertino...

32:54.906 --> 32:57.688
...you don't want Louise
to have the operation?

33:11.097 --> 33:14.709
I was 41 years old
when Louise was born.

33:14.937 --> 33:19.127
I knew right away
that something was wrong.

33:20.314 --> 33:22.136
I couldn't see Louise,
but I saw the doctor.

33:22.298 --> 33:27.154
He was frowning and snapping
his fingers over the little bassinet.

33:27.354 --> 33:30.485
They took her away
before I had the chance to see her.

33:32.121 --> 33:36.594
I thought maybe she'd died.
Maybe the umbilical cord had gotten...

33:36.794 --> 33:40.023
...wrapped around her neck.
Nobody told me anything.

33:40.249 --> 33:44.472
Then they put me in another room
with mothers and their babies.

33:44.666 --> 33:48.343
And I waited there for hours...

33:48.570 --> 33:51.668
...until the doctor finally
came back.

33:51.833 --> 33:53.776
He looked very sad.

33:53.945 --> 33:56.727
He told me that Louise was mongoloid.

33:57.914 --> 34:01.591
He said that I should put her
in a state hospital...

34:01.785 --> 34:04.087
...and never ever see her again.

34:04.313 --> 34:07.925
She will die if she doesn't have
this operation.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.188
We all die, doctor.

34:12.344 --> 34:17.047
Louise has been the light of my life
for 37 years.

34:17.337 --> 34:21.810
God blessed me with this wonderful
girl, and I wouldn't change a thing.

34:23.705 --> 34:27.283
I'm not going to be here much longer.

34:29.208 --> 34:32.886
I'm her whole life,
just as she has always been mine.

34:33.112 --> 34:37.172
There are group homes.
Places where she can make friends...

34:37.337 --> 34:41.047
...enjoy life, even if it is
for only a few more years.

34:42.393 --> 34:47.281
I went to a home 20 years ago
when my husband died.

34:47.482 --> 34:52.632
If something happened to me,
who would take care of her?

34:52.857 --> 34:57.014
And there were women there like her
with Down's...

34:58.329 --> 35:02.039
...wandering around half-naked.
They didn't even know their names.

35:03.481 --> 35:05.848
I couldn't put Louise
in a place like that.

35:08.665 --> 35:11.512
You want to save people, doctor.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.673
If my daughter dies, you'll lose.

35:14.905 --> 35:18.167
But I'm not afraid of death.

35:18.361 --> 35:21.460
Jesus is there, waiting for us.

35:21.657 --> 35:24.886
To hold us
and bring us into the light.

35:25.081 --> 35:28.081
To show us the kingdom of heaven.

35:28.921 --> 35:32.849
And if Louise dies before I do...

35:33.017 --> 35:38.254
...I know where I will see her next.
With angels where she belongs.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.847
Because she is an angel.

35:42.810 --> 35:45.744
My angel.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.720
- Something new?
- Mesenteric embolectomy.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.092
- Who's doing it?
- Dr. Carter.

35:59.289 --> 36:02.769
- Dr. Carter!
- Just rolled the woman into 3.

36:02.970 --> 36:06.417
Sweet God in heaven.
I hope someone's helping him.

36:06.585 --> 36:11.407
We're putting in a Port-A-Cath, a
catheter used to deliver chemotherapy.

36:11.641 --> 36:14.773
Should you pursue a career in surgery,
you'll perform this procedure...

36:14.969 --> 36:18.614
...dozens of times in
your first year of residency.

36:18.809 --> 36:23.064
The position of the catheter must be
checked with a fluoroscope.

36:23.257 --> 36:27.251
Does everyone know what
a fluoroscope is? Here it is.

36:27.449 --> 36:30.067
Can I steal Debbie?
We need her in O.R. 3.

36:30.265 --> 36:31.639
What's going on?

36:31.833 --> 36:34.615
Dr. Carter is performing
a mesenteric embolectomy.

36:34.777 --> 36:39.055
- By himself?
- Anspaugh and Hicks are supervising.

36:48.761 --> 36:52.056
- What's the score?
- Bulls are down by one.

36:53.081 --> 36:55.416
Oh, what a nice shot.

36:57.817 --> 37:03.895
I let a kid with CF leave the
hospital today. He's 18 years old.

37:04.089 --> 37:08.279
He went off to die with
his girlfriend. Didn't want any help.

37:08.441 --> 37:12.435
- Could you have done anything?
- No, not really.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.456
I spent the day...

37:14.649 --> 37:18.578
...trying to get a CHF patient with
Down's on the heart transplant list.

37:18.810 --> 37:20.184
Any luck?

37:20.345 --> 37:23.989
Mother wouldn't sign
the surgical release.

37:24.185 --> 37:27.152
Fine couple of doctors we are.

37:27.385 --> 37:30.320
Do you remember when we were going
to change the world?

37:30.521 --> 37:32.856
No. I was always in it for the money.

37:34.585 --> 37:37.367
All right. See you later.

37:37.593 --> 37:40.495
- Want to grab a pizza?
- No, I have to be someplace.

37:40.697 --> 37:42.104
Anybody I know?

37:42.265 --> 37:45.232
No, I'm just helping out
an old friend. See you.

37:48.537 --> 37:50.359
- Hi.
- Are you ready to go?

37:50.553 --> 37:53.488
- Where?
- Dinner at Morton's and <i>La Boh áme.</i>

37:53.689 --> 37:57.202
- I said we didn't want the tickets.
- I said you were wrong.

37:57.401 --> 38:02.290
- I'm not dressed, we'll be late.
- You can tell me what we missed.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.489
- What about the basketball game?
- Taping it.

38:05.721 --> 38:08.656
You don't have
to prove anything, Greg.

38:08.825 --> 38:12.306
- I don't?
- This has all been pretty fast.

38:12.505 --> 38:14.644
We can slow it down.
Make sure it's right.

38:14.809 --> 38:17.460
So this means that we don't
have to go to the opera?

38:18.297 --> 38:21.461
No, seriously.
Can we just slow it down?

38:26.553 --> 38:30.514
- Sure.
- Okay.

38:34.137 --> 38:37.749
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

38:37.945 --> 38:40.279
- Have you been waiting long?
- Oh, a while.

38:42.393 --> 38:45.459
- So you took it?
- Yes, I did.

38:45.657 --> 38:50.065
- And?
- I knew a lot more than I thought.

38:50.266 --> 38:55.667
There were a lot of people taking it.
Kids. I felt about 100 years old.

38:55.897 --> 38:58.799
They seemed confident and smart.
I guessed a lot.

38:59.001 --> 39:03.541
- I bet you did great.
- Thanks.

39:03.737 --> 39:09.105
- Was your day okay?
- You know, just saving lives.

39:09.305 --> 39:13.102
- Have you seen my mom?
- I banged the door, nobody answered.

39:13.306 --> 39:15.607
Do you want to come in?
I'll make some coffee.

39:15.801 --> 39:19.543
No, I can't. I'm up early.
I'm going to go home.

39:19.769 --> 39:21.777
Okay.

39:21.946 --> 39:24.913
- See you tomorrow then.
- Yes.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.462
Doug, I know everyone
is worried about me...

39:28.697 --> 39:33.748
...but I'm fine. I was scared
in that store, but I'm okay now.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.867
- Why did you take it?
- The MCATs?

39:39.065 --> 39:42.000
For me. I just wanted to see
if I was good enough.

39:45.594 --> 39:47.416
You are.

40:02.489 --> 40:04.758
I love this place.

40:04.985 --> 40:09.328
You should, you're a wonderful
surgeon. You belong here.

40:11.961 --> 40:14.678
You know, you were right this morning.

40:14.873 --> 40:18.801
I haven't slept much in the last few
months since Gant's dying.

40:19.001 --> 40:21.237
Before that, me almost killing
that baby...

40:21.401 --> 40:24.369
...and Keaton
not recommending me...

40:27.065 --> 40:29.913
Six months ago,
I thought I was invincible.

40:32.057 --> 40:34.064
And now I don't even...

40:36.153 --> 40:37.975
I don't even know.

40:40.217 --> 40:44.341
I guess life isn't working out
the way I thought it would.

40:45.785 --> 40:49.200
You're not responsible
for Dr. Gant's death, Peter.

40:50.425 --> 40:56.819
I could have stopped it. Told him
he was doing well, encouraged him.

40:57.017 --> 41:00.595
I wish I could tell you
that it was all intentional.

41:00.793 --> 41:05.397
That it was part of some master plan
that I had going on.

41:05.625 --> 41:09.073
Truthfully,
I never even thought about Gant.

41:10.041 --> 41:11.350
He was just an intern.

41:11.545 --> 41:17.775
I was more involved with my career,
my ambitions.

41:18.873 --> 41:21.590
We all have to find our own way,
Peter.

41:21.753 --> 41:24.273
You're not invincible.
You're a young doctor.

41:24.473 --> 41:28.696
You're learning,
making mistakes, saving lives.

41:28.921 --> 41:31.408
It takes a lifetime.

41:32.793 --> 41:35.346
You just have to have faith.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.012
Go home.
You have got a busy day tomorrow.

41:42.745 --> 41:45.428
More circumcisions and Port-A-Caths?

41:45.625 --> 41:50.132
No. I've signed you up
for a lap choly at 6...

41:50.329 --> 41:54.420
...and I would appreciate it if you'd
assist me on a splenectomy at 11.

41:56.473 --> 41:57.880
Thank you, Dr. Hicks.

41:59.321 --> 42:01.623
You're welcome, Peter.
See you in the morning.
