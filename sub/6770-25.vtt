WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:01.634
DAVID:
<i>Knees.</i>

00:01.701 --> 00:03.436
DONNA: You're here.
Half of your legs.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.105
-Huh?
-Your legs are longer.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.573
DAVID: But don't.
You can't straighten your knees.

00:06.639 --> 00:10.477
It's against the rules.

00:10.543 --> 00:11.177
(Donna laughs,
woman on TV screams)

00:11.244 --> 00:13.446
Stop! I want to watch the movie!

00:13.513 --> 00:14.280
I wanted to go out
and see a movie.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.281
I didn't want to stay here
and watch

00:15.348 --> 00:17.450
<i>War of the Worlds.</i>
(groans playfully)

00:17.517 --> 00:19.152
(laughs):
Ow!

00:19.219 --> 00:21.154
Ow! Owee!

00:21.221 --> 00:22.188
(David laughs)

00:22.255 --> 00:23.690
The victor!

00:23.757 --> 00:26.760
Oh... I'm sorry.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.027
(Donna laughs)

00:28.094 --> 00:30.363
So, this is your idea of a date?

00:30.430 --> 00:31.431
Hey, well, after ten years,

00:31.498 --> 00:34.367
I thought we could just skip
the dating portion.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.035
I'm not very good at it.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.637
Well, that's just 'cause you've
been dating the wrong guys.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.738
Oh, yeah?

00:38.805 --> 00:41.074
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.509
As my best friend...

00:42.575 --> 00:43.309
Mm-hmm.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.345
...you could have
told me sooner.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.347
(David chuckles)

00:50.483 --> 00:51.718
(clears throat)
Sorry.

00:52.852 --> 00:54.654
Donna.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.356
Hey.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.592
Thought you'd be working
or out with Ellen.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.795
Yeah, she's not really
returning my calls right now.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.432
You know what, I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:07.534 --> 01:08.835
Well, he didn't seem
too surprised.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.804
Well, Camille will be.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.105
Who's gonna tell her?

01:12.172 --> 01:14.407
(sighs)

01:14.474 --> 01:15.442
I will.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.610
When does she get back in town?

01:17.677 --> 01:19.112
Tonight.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.381
And tomorrow,
we'll be working side-by-side,

01:21.448 --> 01:23.817
and the day after that
and the next and the next.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.518
Well, that'll be exciting.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.653
Oh, boy.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.089
KELLY: <i> I just want</i>
<i>to grab a quick bite.</i>

01:30.156 --> 01:31.324
Okay, that band
we're seeing tonight?

01:31.391 --> 01:32.826
-Mm-hmm.
-Out of Seattle, home to

01:32.892 --> 01:36.095
the nation's seventh-largest
population of artists.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.130
Oh, really?

01:37.197 --> 01:38.698
My fiancé's been brainwashed

01:38.765 --> 01:40.600
by the Greater Seattle
Chamber of Commerce.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.668
No, see, that's another thing.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.102
There isn't one.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.804
They only have
a-a lesser Seattle movement

01:44.871 --> 01:47.407
because it's such
a great city that they've had to

01:47.474 --> 01:48.441
discourage people
from going there.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.709
What does that tell you?

01:49.776 --> 01:52.612
That there are a lot of people
who want what they can't have.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.616
Hey, Dylan!

01:59.419 --> 02:01.421
-Here you go, D.
-Uh, that's to go.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.890
But I thought you said
it was for here...

02:05.925 --> 02:08.895
Oh, my mistake. I do that.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.131
Come eat with us.

02:17.203 --> 02:17.871
What's going on?

02:17.937 --> 02:19.539
Nothing.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.140
Really?

02:21.207 --> 02:24.544
Dylan decided on his own,
out of the blue,

02:24.611 --> 02:25.879
that he wants to be with me.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.747
He told you this?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.148
In his own way.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.149
(scoffs)

02:30.216 --> 02:32.151
Hey.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.420
He just wants to stir things up.
Don't let him, okay?

02:34.487 --> 02:35.822
I don't plan on it.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.524
Tell me more about Seattle.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.825
Kelly, I'm not gonna sell you

02:38.892 --> 02:40.927
on a life that you don't want.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.662
I'm not remotely interested
in that.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.465
Enlighten me so that I can make
an educated decision

02:45.532 --> 02:47.901
about where I want to live
with my husband.

Welcome back.

04:43.049 --> 04:43.816
Thank you.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.052
Um, I brought muffins
this morning

04:46.119 --> 04:48.955
and some Pennsylvania Dutch
pretzels from my sister's.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.990
-Fat-free.
-Thanks.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.992
Maybe later.

04:53.059 --> 04:56.562
So, um, did you have
an okay time in Philadelphia?

04:56.629 --> 04:57.997
Uh, yeah. It was hard at first.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.966
Um, here are the messages
off the service.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.935
I forgot the code,
so I couldn't call in.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.805
I was here at 8:00,
wondering if David

05:05.872 --> 05:07.040
was trying to reach me.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.776
Pathetic, isn't it?

05:09.842 --> 05:10.877
Did you speak to him?

05:10.943 --> 05:11.811
No.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.881
He left two messages
at home last night.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.750
Ah, let him wonder, right?

05:17.817 --> 05:21.020
Mm. Well, obviously,
he wants to talk to you.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.021
Donna, he called twice.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.557
We only broke up a week ago.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.025
What could be so urgent?

05:26.092 --> 05:28.961
Unless he had a change of heart.

05:30.596 --> 05:31.764
What do you think?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.033
I can't really speak for David.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.669
Donna, you talk to him
every day.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.772
I mean, you guys broke up,
right?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.008
Yeah, completely,
totally out of the blue.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.009
Yeah, but you were
having problems.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.778
Yeah, again, out of nowhere.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.549
About Dylan, about nothing.

05:49.615 --> 05:52.351
David's a thoughtful guy.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.987
Exactly. He overthinks.

05:55.054 --> 05:58.558
Things were so perfect so fast.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.560
I think it scared him.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.696
I mean, what else could it be?

06:10.603 --> 06:12.505
JANET:
<i>Ow!</i>

06:12.572 --> 06:14.373
What happened?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.476
Oh, my God, she bit me!

06:16.542 --> 06:17.510
She bit you?

06:17.577 --> 06:18.478
Oh, my God, what is that?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.481
(gasps) Is that a tooth?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.682
Yeah. Isn't that cute?

06:22.749 --> 06:24.417
-You knew this was happening?
-Well, yeah.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.952
I saw a little speck
of white the other day.

06:26.018 --> 06:29.522
Her first tooth and I missed it?

06:29.589 --> 06:31.424
What's next,
her first tuba recital?

06:31.491 --> 06:32.725
Oh, no, our daughter's not
playing the tuba.

06:32.792 --> 06:33.826
She won't have any dates
when she's older

06:33.893 --> 06:35.094
if she's playing the tuba.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.830
I just really want to be with
her, but I want to work, too.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.832
Well, we had the best
of both worlds.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.701
We don't have to sell.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.469
Are you sick of staying home?

06:43.536 --> 06:44.771
I don't know.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.773
But I know we still have
our negotiating stance.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.709
Just tell Yoffe
you don't want to work so much.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.744
Yeah, that's exactly
what they'd expect:

06:51.811 --> 06:54.847
a woman in the workplace
with a baby just loses ambition.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.517
Well, who cares
what people think?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.452
Yoffe needs you
more than you need him.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.854
Case in point, would you have
led with a manatee?

07:01.921 --> 07:04.757
It's not a manatee.
It's a mermaid.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.526
Yeah, nice try.
Terrible retouch.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.661
Honey, mermaids are not scary.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.664
Okay, I'll talk to him
about scaling back.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.566
You're probably right.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.934
And some more editorial notes
here, too.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.736
Give 'em a look-see,
let me know

07:16.803 --> 07:17.837
what you think, okay?

07:17.904 --> 07:19.205
Okay.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.208
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.814
New sexy lingerie.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.683
I can't think of a better way
to say "I love you."

07:30.750 --> 07:33.486
Well, even when I knew
how I felt about David,

07:33.553 --> 07:35.788
I guess I was
just really scared

07:35.855 --> 07:36.923
to take that leap, you know?

07:36.989 --> 07:38.758
Yeah.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.694
Speaking of which,
how <i> is</i> Dylan?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.963
He's not talking to me,
which is so obnoxious,

07:44.030 --> 07:45.832
because everything was fine.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.733
But you're the one that said
"All or nothing."

07:47.800 --> 07:49.669
Yeah, but I didn't mean it
so literally.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.905
I mean, I should have never let
him narrow down the categories.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.807
There is a lot between
all or nothing.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.509
Mm-hmm.

07:56.576 --> 07:59.545
I'm gonna need long underwear
if we move to Seattle.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.215
Are you really considering that?

08:02.281 --> 08:04.717
I don't know. Maybe.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.587
I just don't understand

08:07.653 --> 08:09.956
what goes on in Dylan's head,
you know?

08:10.022 --> 08:12.625
Uh, he doesn't want you
to marry someone else.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.862
Well, I don't even want
his attitude at my wedding.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.730
I'm gonna go talk to him
this afternoon.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.699
Oh, uh, don't bother.
I talked to him this morning.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.667
He said he's gonna be surfing
at Point Dume all day.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.903
You have to admire
his work ethic.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.271
Yeah, right.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.506
I don't like this.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.908
Yeah.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.910
NOAH:
<i>Hi. My name is Noah,</i>

08:30.977 --> 08:32.278
and I'm an alcoholic.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.746
ALL:
Hi, Noah.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.616
Look, I lost Donna
'cause I drank.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.821
I drank because I lost her.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.089
(chuckles softly)

08:43.155 --> 08:45.024
Whole thing's enough
to make you want to drink.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.560
(all chuckle)

08:53.366 --> 08:54.834
Um...

08:57.670 --> 08:59.005
Excuse me.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.076
Ellen! Hey, hey!

09:05.945 --> 09:07.747
I didn't see you in there.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.783
You need to be able to talk
in there and be honest,

09:10.850 --> 09:12.885
but hearing about
your great love for Donna is

09:12.952 --> 09:14.086
a bit much for me.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.722
Just listen to me, okay?

09:16.789 --> 09:18.691
You know, it doesn't matter
if I'm overreacting.

09:18.758 --> 09:19.792
I'm coming here for strength.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.330
Look, I'll just go
to AA meetings in Brentwood,

09:24.397 --> 09:26.999
and the rest of L.A.
is yours, okay?

09:34.707 --> 09:35.708
Wow!

09:35.775 --> 09:36.909
May I help you?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.144
Yeah. I'm Steve Sanders.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.680
Founding father of <i> The Beat?</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:43.349
Steve-- Janet's husband Steve.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.218
Oh, right. Janet, visitor.

09:47.286 --> 09:48.654
Oh, hi, honey!

09:48.721 --> 09:49.322
Hi!

09:49.388 --> 09:52.258
Hey, big girl! Hi!

09:52.325 --> 09:53.259
(kisses)

09:53.326 --> 09:54.760
Wendy, could you, uh,
mix up some cappuccinos?

09:54.827 --> 09:56.629
Hey, Sanders, how you doing?

09:56.696 --> 09:57.697
I'm going pretty good.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.332
Hey, I saw your first edition.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.335
Nice. I-I had some notes
for you, though.

10:02.401 --> 10:03.369
Janet, did you...?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.670
Mm, uh-huh, yeah.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.172
Uh, they were great.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.274
Cool. Well, if you'd like
to talk about 'em...

10:08.341 --> 10:09.342
Maybe later.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.344
Editorial roundtable, 7:30.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.878
Wendy's taking dinner orders.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.749
So cute.

10:16.816 --> 10:17.850
-(Madeline fusses)
-Hi.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.952
You didn't talk to him
about working less, did you?

10:27.927 --> 10:31.831
I tried to, but the conversation
took a different turn.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.166
He offered me a job
running another magazine.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.635
It's called <i> Nouveau,</i>

10:36.702 --> 10:38.804
and he said that it was smart
and savvy.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.806
Oh, as opposed to what
you're working on here.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.809
Well, it would be a different
level of writing, yes.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.011
(Madeline cooing)

10:45.077 --> 10:46.012
Look, maybe it's
a ridiculous idea,

10:46.078 --> 10:48.647
but I think we should at least
talk about it.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.182
Oh, when?
You're hardly home now.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.118
And what's gonna happen
to this place?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.954
<i>The Beat</i> will still be here.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.857
I'll be home at 10:00.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.959
10:00.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.765
Janet, that bearded lady
expert's on line two.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.999
Okay.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.704
I worked in this building
for three years.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.773
I must have climbed those stairs
a thousand times,

11:13.839 --> 11:15.875
and now they finally fix
the elevator?

11:15.941 --> 11:17.176
(sighs)

11:33.926 --> 11:35.061
(line ringing)

11:35.127 --> 11:36.829
-ELLEN: Hello.
-Hey, it's me.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.798
Hi.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.900
I was just checking to see
if you're okay.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.003
Are you?

11:44.070 --> 11:45.938
Honestly, I feel lousy.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.907
Look, I'm sorry I...

11:47.973 --> 11:50.209
No, no, I am.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.012
(sighs)

11:53.079 --> 11:55.948
You've done so much.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.249
You've helped me
with my daughter,

11:57.316 --> 12:01.053
you've gotten me this job,
not once but twice,

12:01.120 --> 12:04.223
and I can't hear word one
about your problems.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.025
I can make you feel better
about Donna. Just...

12:06.092 --> 12:06.992
You're upset,

12:07.059 --> 12:09.995
I rub it up a notch,
and then you console me?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.964
Sound healthy?

12:12.031 --> 12:13.966
How do you want to handle it?

12:14.033 --> 12:15.334
I have a list.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.938
A list of things to do.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.840
Things like
"Feed Caitlin dinner.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.308
"Pick her up from school.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.009
"Do the laundry.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.846
Open the mail."

12:26.912 --> 12:29.048
And my mom's just waiting
for me to fail.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.983
Nobody wants you to fail.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.885
I guess.

12:32.952 --> 12:35.154
But the list?

12:35.221 --> 12:38.023
I really need to just
stick to it, you know?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.892
I need to keep things simple.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.894
No room for shake-ups
like today, huh?

12:41.961 --> 12:45.231
Zero margin for error
due to upset.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.934
If you need anything, call.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.870
Right.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.805
Noah, I mean it.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.055
So, how was that for the longest
lunch in history?

13:10.122 --> 13:12.024
Well, I was gone
for a while, too.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.027
Wasn't exactly a line
when I got back.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.929
Well, I was upset.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.063
I just saw David.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.432
Hmm...

13:20.499 --> 13:22.935
I'm-I'm not gonna talk
about it or think about it.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.403
I'm just gonna push through.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.272
You should do
what you need to do.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.043
Camille, I'm-I'm really sorry.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.313
Donna, don't apologize!

13:34.380 --> 13:36.348
You knew all along that David
wasn't calling

13:36.415 --> 13:38.117
to get back together with me!

13:41.120 --> 13:44.056
I sound like the bitter
dumped girl.

13:44.123 --> 13:47.026
No, you-you sound hurt.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.861
And you have every right to be.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.364
Donna, please, don't be nice.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.999
It just makes it harder.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.868
(sobbing)

13:55.935 --> 13:58.204
Come here.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.940
This is really awful, isn't it?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.408
Yes.

14:04.410 --> 14:08.948
Yeah, I'm sitting here
hugging the other woman.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.218
Camille...

14:12.284 --> 14:14.253
I-I just...

14:14.320 --> 14:16.488
I think this is gonna be
too hard.

14:16.555 --> 14:19.124
On who?

14:19.191 --> 14:22.261
For both of us, to be honest.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.898
So, uh, what do you think
we should do about the store?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.199
What do you mean?

14:27.266 --> 14:28.867
Work here. That's what we do.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.437
I'm sorry. I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.873
But I am more than happy
to buy out your percentage.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.876
Oh, so now you want
my job, too?!

14:37.943 --> 14:39.912
-Look, Camille, I didn't mean...
-Donna, I-I don't want

14:39.979 --> 14:41.981
to sit around
and cry at home all day!

14:42.047 --> 14:43.983
I need to keep working!

14:44.049 --> 14:46.085
Okay, no. You know what?

14:46.151 --> 14:50.089
I'm sorry. That's,
um, that's what we'll do.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.457
(Camille sighs)

15:06.605 --> 15:08.140
Ooh, you know what?

15:08.207 --> 15:10.009
This caterer
did Michael Jackson

15:10.075 --> 15:10.976
and Lisa Marie's wedding.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.044
(chuckles)

15:12.111 --> 15:13.279
That is too good.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.014
Hmm.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.416
He said that he's gonna have
samples of appetizers and wines.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.551
You don't have to go back
to the office, do you?

15:19.618 --> 15:22.254
Nope. I'm in full
bridegroom mode.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.556
Good.

-What?

15:29.995 --> 15:33.966
You get final say on the menu,

Thank you, Jessica.

Here's what we know.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.447
Although the warnings were in
effect, many local surfers...

15:48.514 --> 15:50.316
Dylan's at Point Dume today.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.450
There were warnings.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.452
They closed the beaches
because the waves were so high.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.287
Well, I know he's there.

They're not gonna give you
a name

until the next of kin
is notified, so...

16:34.293 --> 16:37.029
Dylan's dad was in
the witness protection program.

No, I-I don't know. I mean,

No, no, that's not it.

20:41.707 --> 20:42.941
Well, what is it?

20:43.008 --> 20:45.510
Kelly?

20:45.577 --> 20:46.912
Yeah?

20:46.979 --> 20:47.946
Anything else?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.248
I was wrong about something.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.018
Good-bye.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.958
So he's okay?

21:00.025 --> 21:01.827
Yeah. (sighs)

21:01.893 --> 21:04.696
I don't know
what I was thinking.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.599
I'd like to get you out of here.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.643
(birds chirping)

21:22.648 --> 21:24.883
Hey. What's going on?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.718
Moving day.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.953
Moving <i> day?</i>

21:28.020 --> 21:31.890
Were you planning on mentioning
this at some earlier point?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.725
Don't screw things up
with Donna.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.927
Noah, why are you
acting like this?

21:35.994 --> 21:39.731
Come on, you and Donna
have been apart for months.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.334
This is your place, okay?

21:42.401 --> 21:44.736
This whole thing's
been temporary; we knew that.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.872
You did me a favor; that's it.

21:46.938 --> 21:49.775
Besides, being a third wheel
is always uncomfortable.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.944
In this case...
it's a lot worse.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.646
So I have a great week
and you have

21:54.713 --> 21:56.014
a bad week,
so you need to move out?

21:56.081 --> 21:57.783
Why don't you just take it
one step further

21:57.849 --> 21:58.884
and cut all your friends off?

21:58.950 --> 22:01.019
You could be at the bar
in an hour.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.855
I forwarded my calls
to the club.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.957
If you move,
it's on you, all right?

22:15.967 --> 22:17.903
MATT:
<i>So you slept okay?</i>

22:17.969 --> 22:19.538
Yeah, after...

22:19.604 --> 22:21.339
I don't know where all that
adrenaline came from,

22:21.406 --> 22:23.108
but when it left, I crashed.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.043
We should probably talk
about it.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.046
NAT:
Dylan.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.849
Turkey, rye, coleslaw.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.987
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.923
And some people say
you're not a predictable guy.

22:37.989 --> 22:38.990
(laughs)

22:42.861 --> 22:44.930
Listen, I'm around today
if you need to get ahold of me.

22:44.996 --> 22:45.931
You know why she called.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.100
Matt.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.735
Actually, no, I don't.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.636
It doesn't matter, okay?

22:51.703 --> 22:54.639
I'm gonna go pay the bill.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.745
(Dylan sighs)

23:03.215 --> 23:05.817
A surfer drowned
at Point Dume yesterday.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.886
Donna told me you were up there.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.454
I wasn't.

23:09.521 --> 23:10.856
Change of plans.

23:10.922 --> 23:13.592
Just the thought that,
that could have been you.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.928
Made you call all over town
looking for me.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.132
We ended up in the morgue.

23:20.198 --> 23:23.401
What are you doing, Kelly?

23:24.469 --> 23:27.539
I was worried and irrational.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.407
What are you doing
with your life?

23:29.474 --> 23:31.143
Matt...

23:31.209 --> 23:35.147
he-he went
to the morgue with you?

23:35.213 --> 23:37.783
He was great to me
during all of it.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.685
Can you imagine?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.788
No, I can't.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.725
But I can see why
he's the kind of guy

23:46.792 --> 23:48.160
that you'd want to hang onto.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.427
(sighs)

23:58.937 --> 24:00.872
MAN (on TV):
<i>Now let's take that parsley</i>

24:00.939 --> 24:03.742
and blend it in with our eggs
and chorizo.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.477
Parsley in a Tex-Mex scramble?

24:05.544 --> 24:06.711
-Come on! You gotta use
cilantro. -Now, I'd like to get

24:06.778 --> 24:09.447
a little browning around the
edges, and what we're gonna do

24:09.514 --> 24:10.448
-is we're gonna add in
a little... -(turns off TV)

24:10.515 --> 24:11.616
Hi, hi, hi.

24:11.683 --> 24:12.951
A meltdown at work.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.654
Stan lost the negatives
on the Mount Hood dragon.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.689
Yoffe's going ballistic.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.791
Well, get the stegosaurus story
we ran last March

24:19.858 --> 24:21.626
and pull the pictures
and-and add...

24:21.693 --> 24:23.528
Add wings? I did that already.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.664
And now I need to paste in
some fire, so I thought I'd use

24:25.730 --> 24:27.732
the pictures from the
Cinco de Mayo barbecue and...

24:27.799 --> 24:28.700
Ah! Perfect!

24:28.767 --> 24:30.202
(sighs)

24:30.268 --> 24:31.770
-Another disaster averted.
-Sounds like

24:31.837 --> 24:32.904
that happens a lot.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.239
Not any more
than any other paper.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.607
I don't remember us having

24:35.674 --> 24:36.741
dramatic emergencies every day.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.945
Well, we're a new team,
and new teams need time to gel.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.580
Oh, I better call Stan

24:41.646 --> 24:43.648
and let him know
that his job is still safe,

24:43.715 --> 24:45.250
and he can send Molly
to private school.

24:46.718 --> 24:47.953
I got to go.

24:48.019 --> 24:49.221
Hmm.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.789
What?

24:50.856 --> 24:51.923
I'm watching cooking shows.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.592
Well, then put on

24:53.658 --> 24:55.227
-a game or something.
-We said we'd sell

24:55.293 --> 24:57.062
the paper if we both agreed.

24:57.128 --> 24:58.997
I was a publisher
of my own newspaper.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.732
I miss that.

25:00.799 --> 25:04.236
Honey, is this because
Yoffe didn't use your ideas?

25:04.302 --> 25:07.539
I know moving to a glossy
magazine means a lot to you,

25:07.606 --> 25:09.674
and I don't want you to miss
any opportunities, but...

25:09.741 --> 25:10.942
(sighs)

25:11.009 --> 25:13.044
...I miss us, the way we were.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.614
This is a new idea, right?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.749
So it's just gonna take
a little bit of time.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.284
I don't want
to sell the paper, Janet.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.823
I'm late,
and this is a huge conversation.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.725
I know.
Well, will you think about it?

25:26.791 --> 25:28.026
I will.

25:32.797 --> 25:33.865
(knocking)

25:33.932 --> 25:37.836
Donna, I know I promised
I'd cook you dinner, but...

25:37.903 --> 25:40.705
No. Uh, if you'd rather go out
and make this a formal date...

25:40.772 --> 25:41.606
No, no.

25:41.673 --> 25:42.974
...which I know
I've been resisting...

25:43.041 --> 25:44.776
-Camille...
-David...

25:45.744 --> 25:46.711
CAMILLE:
Oh.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.079
(laughs):
Perfect.

25:48.146 --> 25:49.714
I'll just go.

25:49.781 --> 25:50.949
-Camille, are you okay?
-DAVID: No, no.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.751
-Yeah, yeah. I-I...
-No, no.

25:52.817 --> 25:53.685
Look, just hang out here, okay?

25:53.752 --> 25:55.954
I don't want you driving
like this. Please.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.023
Just wait for me.

25:59.824 --> 26:00.825
(sighs)

26:00.892 --> 26:01.826
She just showed up.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.328
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.597
No, that's fine. You know what?
You should deal with her.

26:05.664 --> 26:08.767
Me being here just, uh, is just
gonna make things worse.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.869
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'll call you later.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.004
I love you.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.073
(door opens)

26:17.375 --> 26:18.944
(door closes)

26:24.883 --> 26:26.584
Are you feeling better yet?

26:26.651 --> 26:27.585
Almost.

26:31.656 --> 26:32.824
You want to try?

26:32.891 --> 26:34.793
No. Way too embarrassing.

26:34.859 --> 26:37.128
(laughs)
Come on. It's easy.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.836
I really don't have good
hand-eye coordination.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.806
All right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:47.872 --> 26:49.908
There we go.

26:49.975 --> 26:51.943
Lower. Now go up.

26:52.010 --> 26:52.944
Head straight.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.180
(laughs):
I can't do this.

26:55.246 --> 26:56.715
Yes, you can.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.783
Not with you watching.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.852
(chuckles) Do you have
to do everything on your own?

27:00.919 --> 27:01.953
No.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.188
Just go stand somewhere else.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.857
Preferably around the block.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.826
You're the one
that said it's okay to call

27:07.892 --> 27:08.927
and to reach out, right?

27:08.994 --> 27:10.762
As a friend.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.130
-Oh.
-'Cause that's the only thing

27:12.197 --> 27:14.032
I'm gonna be good at right now.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.834
Can you trust me on that?

27:15.900 --> 27:16.968
Yep.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.803
(laughs)

27:18.870 --> 27:21.840
Look, I just want you to have
faith in yourself, that's all.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.145
I'll be right over here.

27:27.212 --> 27:28.847
Okay.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.782
(laughs)

27:35.220 --> 27:36.154
(bat strikes ball)

27:36.221 --> 27:38.757
Yeah! Very nice.

27:38.823 --> 27:39.758
Very nice.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.426
(giggles)

27:50.235 --> 27:52.003
(keys jingling)

27:52.070 --> 27:53.004
(chuckles)

27:53.071 --> 27:55.774
How you doing, hon?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.743
Matt said he had to work late.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.845
I'm going through
the Seattle paper,

28:00.912 --> 28:03.081
looking for apartments
and employment listings.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.783
Have you even opened it yet?

28:04.849 --> 28:05.817
No.

28:05.884 --> 28:09.220
Okay, you don't have
a job there, your friends

28:09.287 --> 28:11.856
and your family aren't there,
you don't want to move.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.158
Why are you even
thinking about this?

28:13.224 --> 28:15.460
Too much history here.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.762
Yeah.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.264
Well, for a long time,

28:19.330 --> 28:22.000
the only history that David
and I had was our own,

28:22.067 --> 28:24.969
and now his past is sitting
in his living room sobbing.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.272
Oh. That wasn't very nice,
was it?

28:27.338 --> 28:30.875
My advice: lock the windows
and doors, don't let her in.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.043
(chuckles)

28:32.110 --> 28:33.745
Camille's not the problem.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.080
I didn't know
you guys had a problem.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.247
(sighs)

28:36.314 --> 28:38.883
I mean, I-I think
David loves me,

28:38.950 --> 28:41.753
but maybe more in a sisterly

28:41.820 --> 28:43.188
type of way.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.990
Like, I think he wants
to arm wrestle, not kiss me.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.258
(laughs)

28:47.325 --> 28:49.894
Oh, we are just both freaks.

28:49.961 --> 28:50.929
You know that, right?

28:50.995 --> 28:52.931
-(Donna chuckles)
-David waited

28:52.997 --> 28:54.966
seven years to sleep with you,

28:55.033 --> 28:57.902
and now
that he's taking things slow,

28:57.969 --> 28:59.504
you think he doesn't want you.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.905
True.

29:00.972 --> 29:03.174
Oh, I hope you're right.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.776
Mm.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.778
But you're a freak?

29:06.845 --> 29:10.014
Dylan gives me one ultimatum,

29:10.081 --> 29:12.784
then he ignores me once,
and the only way

29:12.851 --> 29:16.187
I can think of him
not in my life is if he's dead.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.256
Now I'm confused.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.992
I heard on the radio that
a surfer died at Point Dume.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.794
You told me he was up there.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.796
Yeah, a lot of people surf
up there.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.265
But I can understand
why you were worried.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.100
I was so scared,
I couldn't breathe.

29:29.167 --> 29:32.036
I just kept hearing his name
over and over,

29:32.103 --> 29:34.973
like, screaming in my head.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.541
Mm, that doesn't sound
like fear.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.909
Sounds like love.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.879
Yeah.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.780
I know that now.

29:42.847 --> 29:45.083
What are you going to do?

29:45.150 --> 29:47.018
Something.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.953
I've got to do something.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.868
Good morning.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.837
Hey. I was just going
to yell for you.

30:05.904 --> 30:06.971
Get 'em while they're hot.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.072
You know, Emeril puts

30:08.139 --> 30:09.307
blueberries inside the pancakes
while they're cooking.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.843
That gives you better fruit
distribution and less mushiness.

30:11.910 --> 30:12.977
Who's Emeril?

30:13.044 --> 30:14.812
(scoffs)
Never mind.

30:14.879 --> 30:18.249
Boy, it's been a long time since
we've had breakfast together.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.319
A good reason
<i>not</i> to sell the paper.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.255
Right. Family breakfasts--
from now on, they're sacrosanct.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.024
Good.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.292
I was up all night.

30:27.358 --> 30:28.960
Oh, yeah?

30:29.027 --> 30:30.828
Oh, it's probably
just the stress.

30:30.895 --> 30:31.796
But don't worry, honey,

30:31.863 --> 30:33.898
'cause once we're both
back in that office,

30:33.965 --> 30:35.867
you'll be sleeping
like a baby.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.936
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday.

30:38.002 --> 30:38.937
Good.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.071
About how strongly you feel,

30:40.138 --> 30:41.272
and I came to a conclusion.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.874
Yeah?

30:42.941 --> 30:44.209
I feel strongly, too.

30:46.077 --> 30:49.013
Steve, I can't pass up this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.882
I know that going

30:50.949 --> 30:52.183
to work at <i> The Beat</i> again
is right for you,

30:52.250 --> 30:53.318
but it's not right for me.

30:53.384 --> 30:54.619
(sighs)

30:54.686 --> 30:56.421
You know, this decision
affects all of us.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.022
-I understand that.
-And you're worried

30:58.089 --> 30:59.390
about missing her first tooth?

30:59.457 --> 31:01.092
Well, pile on
all the other moments,

31:01.159 --> 31:03.394
Janet, because
they're just gonna fly by.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.898
Preschool, her first dance,

31:06.965 --> 31:08.933
road trips
to check out colleges.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.168
Okay, that's not fair.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.904
Pancake breakfasts
are good, Janet.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.606
Don't let ambition blind you
to that.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.274
Why is it, in regard to women,

31:16.341 --> 31:19.010
the word "ambition"
sounds like a bad thing?

31:19.077 --> 31:20.311
'Cause this time, it is.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.282
This job may work out for you,

31:24.349 --> 31:26.351
but it doesn't work for us.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.254
Well, I'll consider myself
warned.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.928
Thanks.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.934
Donna, I'm sorry

31:43.001 --> 31:45.203
that I screwed up your dinner
last night.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.206
Oh, it's... it's okay.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.674
I was upset. I had to see him.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.011
I miss him.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.380
I mean, I know we didn't date
for that long, but...

31:55.446 --> 31:57.081
Camille, I'm... I'm sorry.

31:57.148 --> 31:58.916
I-I can't hear this.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.288
Donna, there's nothing more
going on between us.

32:03.354 --> 32:05.223
I mean,
it couldn't be more over.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.927
Look, I'm...
I'm just not the friend

32:09.994 --> 32:12.230
that you can go to about it.

32:12.297 --> 32:16.401
'Cause if I give you advice,
you're not gonna trust me.

32:16.467 --> 32:20.672
If I, if I tell you I'm sorry,
you're not gonna believe me.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.407
Yeah, maybe you're right.

32:22.473 --> 32:25.243
I think I am.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.210
Which is why

32:26.277 --> 32:29.314
I wouldn't blame you
for hating me for it.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.385
Do you mind
if we work out the details

32:34.452 --> 32:36.988
of the buyout later?

32:37.055 --> 32:38.489
Sure, whenever.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.491
You're gonna be really fair

32:40.558 --> 32:44.495
and generous about this,
aren't you?

32:44.562 --> 32:45.363
I'm gonna try.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.432
Yeah.

32:47.498 --> 32:50.301
That's what's really gonna
make you hard to hate.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.538
(laughs):
I hate that.

32:53.604 --> 32:56.074
Thanks. (laughs) I think.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.379
I'm really gonna miss you.

33:01.446 --> 33:04.248
Same here.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.055
(knocking)

33:13.391 --> 33:15.393
KELLY:
Hi.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.462
Do you feel like
going for a walk?

33:19.397 --> 33:21.132
Along the beach.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.533
It's a beautiful day.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.276
(Dylan groans softly)

33:32.343 --> 33:34.078
You're not gonna
let me back in, are you?

33:34.145 --> 33:35.079
(Dylan sighs)

33:35.146 --> 33:36.180
What's the point?

33:36.247 --> 33:38.249
You're engaged
to marry someone else.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.184
You want me to say
that I'm happy for you?

33:40.251 --> 33:41.386
I'm not.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.354
I'm glad.

33:43.421 --> 33:45.189
(sighs):
I'm...

33:45.256 --> 33:48.192
I'm glad that you're
being straight with me,

33:48.259 --> 33:51.262
that you're saying things
that need to be said...

33:52.296 --> 33:53.498
...before...

33:53.564 --> 33:56.234
What? B-Before what?

33:59.504 --> 34:01.406
Truth is,

34:01.472 --> 34:04.075
I can never imagine

34:04.142 --> 34:05.443
having you...

34:05.510 --> 34:08.379
without imagining
losing you to...

34:08.446 --> 34:11.349
another woman or an addiction...

34:11.416 --> 34:14.152
or your inevitable
lack of interest.

34:14.217 --> 34:18.156
You already said no to me once;
I don't need to hear it again.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.425
Maybe I am not repeating myself.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.534
(exhales)

34:30.601 --> 34:32.402
It isn't right.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.404
So what'd you
come over here for,

34:33.471 --> 34:35.373
to say you want to be friends?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.275
Is that it?

34:38.342 --> 34:40.511
I want to go
for a walk with you.

34:40.578 --> 34:45.283
Taking a walk is not
gonna get us anywhere.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.587
It's not gonna get us here.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.328
I know.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.255
So, I'm thinking of sending
Caitlin out for softball.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.491
I hear that sports
teach girls confidence.

35:26.557 --> 35:30.862
Well, if she's anything
like you, she'll be a real pro.

35:30.928 --> 35:32.563
You're a natural.

35:32.630 --> 35:36.267
Mm, well, not at
feeling good about myself.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.902
Caitlin's father,

35:37.969 --> 35:40.571
remember I told you,
was a one-night stand?

35:40.638 --> 35:43.307
Well, we have
this mutual friend,

35:43.374 --> 35:46.377
and I hear he is
happily married,

35:46.444 --> 35:48.412
two kids, beautiful house.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.714
How does it make you feel?

35:49.780 --> 35:53.284
Like I am standing in quicksand

35:53.351 --> 35:55.453
and everybody else is sprinting.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.190
And I felt that way
about a guy I barely know.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.660
I know that your relationship
with Donna was different.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.495
Yeah, we were pretty serious.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.931
But, uh, it's been over
for a long time.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.600
So it-it shouldn't
have upset me...

36:09.667 --> 36:11.269
but it did.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.238
And I meant to be
upset about it for days,

36:14.305 --> 36:16.407
because I'm a drunk
and that's what I do.

36:18.609 --> 36:21.479
But then this guy I know
from AA called me.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.614
Really?

36:23.681 --> 36:24.916
Yeah, he needed a friend.

36:24.982 --> 36:25.950
(chuckles)

36:26.017 --> 36:27.618
Does he have dark hair,
kind of crazy, that guy?

36:27.685 --> 36:28.619
Nice guy.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.354
(chuckles)

36:30.421 --> 36:32.290
And luckily,
I had my ever-present

36:32.356 --> 36:34.225
list of things to do.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.694
So when he gave me the address
of a batting cage,

36:36.761 --> 36:39.764
I wrote it down,
right next to...

36:39.830 --> 36:42.366
buying a terrarium
for Caitlin's iguana,

36:42.433 --> 36:44.468
reworking a status report
and making dinner.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.772
Each item on the list
checked off, I'll have you know.

36:47.838 --> 36:51.509
Did you mark down the part about
getting upset later, just...?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.544
Yeah, right next to where
I wrote down to call Noah

36:53.611 --> 36:57.415
and give him the good news...

36:57.481 --> 37:00.351
that I'm stronger
than I thought...

37:00.418 --> 37:02.486
and I want more.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.722
See, I don't want
to push you, you know.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.391
Okay.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.628
Then just stand still.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.474
(knocking)

37:37.555 --> 37:40.558
Hi. You got my message.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.693
Uh, my mom called.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.328
Y-You called, too?

37:44.395 --> 37:45.496
Yeah. Yeah.

37:49.533 --> 37:52.036
Matt, what's wrong?

37:52.103 --> 37:54.038
You know, my brother--
he always,

37:54.105 --> 37:57.041
he always works late, so...

37:57.108 --> 37:59.310
rush-hour traffic
in Manhattan--

37:59.377 --> 38:01.412
it's-it's not a factor.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.718
But his wife is pregnant,
and he was dying to get home.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.054
It's so weird.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.624
Two days ago, we're...
chasing some ambulance

38:13.691 --> 38:16.460
down PCH on instinct,

38:16.527 --> 38:19.597
and today...

38:19.664 --> 38:22.600
there's a pileup on
Long Island Expressway, and...

38:22.667 --> 38:25.603
I didn't feel anything.

38:29.874 --> 38:34.478
Now I got to go home
to New York...

38:34.545 --> 38:36.814
for my brother's funeral.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.353
How do I do that?

38:42.420 --> 38:43.354
(sighs)

38:43.421 --> 38:44.655
I'll go with you.

38:44.722 --> 38:46.824
I'll take care of everything.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.075
Hi.

39:04.141 --> 39:05.776
Hey.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.712
I've been waiting for you.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.448
Look, I-I just
have to say one thing.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.515
Hmm?

39:11.582 --> 39:13.417
I love you.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.720
But if you've changed your mind

39:15.786 --> 39:16.987
about wanting
to be a couple again,

39:17.054 --> 39:18.622
-just tell me.
-Mm, Donna.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.824
I mean,

39:19.890 --> 39:22.393
speak freely
but avoid specifics.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.061
(laughs)

39:24.128 --> 39:25.830
What specifics?

39:25.896 --> 39:29.467
Oh. Well, you know, like if...

39:29.533 --> 39:33.037
when you kiss me, if it feels
like you're kissing your sister.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.973
Well, I only have a stepsister,
and that's pretty gross.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.044
You realize how long
we've known each other?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.879
Yeah.

39:41.946 --> 39:44.448
Long enough to feel like family.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.084
Is that the way
you feel about me?

39:47.151 --> 39:49.954
Somewhat, yeah, I guess so.

39:50.020 --> 39:53.124
Great. Well, I-I guess
that's why you don't want to see

39:53.190 --> 39:54.825
the new underwear I bought.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.927
You bought new underwear?

39:58.162 --> 39:58.796
I bought something, too, but...

39:58.863 --> 40:00.631
I want to show you this first.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.933
DONNA:
That is my high school yearbook.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.402
DAVID: Yeah, I pinched it,
but it's for a good cause.

40:05.469 --> 40:06.403
(clears throat)

40:06.470 --> 40:09.840
"Dear Donna, wow, senior year.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.075
I never thought we'd make it."

40:11.142 --> 40:12.643
Did you really date this guy?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.078
Yeah.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.846
Poor thing.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.916
"Sanders and his jock friends
never thought you'd date me.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.551
"But you did.

40:20.618 --> 40:23.954
"You let me kiss you, and
I haven't wanted to stop since.

40:24.021 --> 40:27.091
"If you turn to page 72,
where my picture used to be..."

40:27.158 --> 40:28.159
Where you Magic-Marker'd it out.

40:28.225 --> 40:30.094
I can't believe you did that.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.898
"...what you'll see instead of a
really bad shot of me is a lie.

40:33.964 --> 40:37.434
Future goals: a career
in the music industry."

40:37.501 --> 40:39.103
That's not a lie.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.906
"That's all I put down because I
couldn't say what I really want.

40:41.972 --> 40:44.975
"That's you. Forever.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.679
"Someday I'm gonna get you
to marry me.

40:48.746 --> 40:51.916
"Without a picture,
we can lie to our kids

40:51.982 --> 40:54.118
and say I used to be handsome."

40:54.185 --> 40:56.220
Mmm, you are so handsome.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.155
Well, as long as you think so.

41:00.224 --> 41:02.459
Come on.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.546
(Donna gasps softly)

41:23.547 --> 41:25.716
Oh, my God.

41:28.118 --> 41:30.721
You can't do this.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.624
I-I didn't even think
you wanted to kiss me.

41:33.691 --> 41:35.159
I did. I do.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.027
(chuckles)

41:44.101 --> 41:46.737
Donna...

41:46.804 --> 41:49.106
Martin, will you marry me?

42:01.619 --> 42:03.053
(whispers):
I don't know.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.989
-Okay.
-(Donna sniffles)

42:05.055 --> 42:08.726
No, I... I mean, I just...
I just need a little time

42:08.792 --> 42:10.527
-to think about it.
-It's all right.

42:10.594 --> 42:12.263
Okay.
