of, like, a jaded look to him,

1:02:44.002 --> 1:02:45.427

1:02:45.504 --> 1:02:47.654
<i> He seems like he has traveled,</i>

1:02:47.672 --> 1:02:51.933
<i> Like, a very, very long path</i>
<i> to get to where we are today</i>

1:02:52.010 --> 1:02:54.102
<i> And he's just ready</i>

1:02:54.179 --> 1:02:55.937

1:02:56.014 --> 1:02:58.756

1:03:00.185 --> 1:03:01.684

1:03:01.837 --> 1:03:04.279

those apps.

1:03:04.356 --> 1:03:05.947

1:03:06.024 --> 1:03:10.010
Like, really serious
deal breakers like, "no!"

1:03:10.028 --> 1:03:11.344
- Someone who's aggressive,
controlling.

1:03:11.346 --> 1:03:12.362
- Oh, that too, yeah.

1:03:12.438 --> 1:03:14.456

what to do.

1:03:14.533 --> 1:03:16.349

and he smokes.

1:03:16.351 --> 1:03:17.292
- Oh.
- Love that.

1:03:17.369 --> 1:03:18.293
- Yeah, kids, yes.

1:03:18.444 --> 1:03:19.869
- Yeah, doesn't want kids,
for sure.

1:03:19.946 --> 1:03:23.799
I think, for me, income-wise,
like, I enjoy doing things

1:03:23.875 --> 1:03:25.133
And, like, a certain lifestyle.

1:03:25.285 --> 1:03:27.527
So I would want to make sure
that they can afford to,

1:03:27.546 --> 1:03:29.879
Because I'm not gonna
change my lifestyle, you know?

1:03:30.032 --> 1:03:31.047
I'm not gonna stop
taking trips.

1:03:31.199 --> 1:03:33.475
I'm not gonna stop,
you know, shopping.

1:03:33.552 --> 1:03:34.810
- Like, that's not gonna stop.
- Absolutely,

1:03:34.886 --> 1:03:36.478
It's not gonna end.

1:03:36.629 --> 1:03:38.647
- My worst-case scenario
is that

1:03:38.723 --> 1:03:39.815
The person I'm matched with

1:03:39.966 --> 1:03:43.985
Is so over-the-top obnoxious,
class clown,

1:03:44.062 --> 1:03:47.213
Someone that's just all about
themselves and egocentric

1:03:47.215 --> 1:03:49.157
And it's just always
"me, me, me,"

1:03:49.234 --> 1:03:52.552
Because that will bring out
the ugly side of me

1:03:52.554 --> 1:03:54.663
That I don't want to come out.

1:03:54.739 --> 1:03:56.556
- Stop it!

1:03:56.558 --> 1:04:00.836
I think bao is probably
one of the nicest,

1:04:00.912 --> 1:04:03.897
Sweetest women
that I have ever met,

1:04:03.915 --> 1:04:06.341
<i> But I feel like she has</i>

1:04:06.492 --> 1:04:09.327
An undercover spicy side
to her.

1:04:13.592 --> 1:04:16.017
<i> She really needs somebody</i>

1:04:16.094 --> 1:04:20.689

<i> wearing the pants.</i>

1:04:22.601 --> 1:04:25.026
So I can tell you
what I'm most worried about.

1:04:25.103 --> 1:04:27.420
My longest relationship
was nine months.

1:04:27.439 --> 1:04:29.030
- What?
- Nine months?

1:04:29.107 --> 1:04:30.532
- Yeah, I know.
The other two after that

1:04:30.609 --> 1:04:32.367
Was, like, two months
and three months.

1:04:32.444 --> 1:04:34.260
- That's a fling.
- I know. I know, right?

1:04:34.279 --> 1:04:37.038
- I barely have, like,
a couple dates in two months.

1:04:37.115 --> 1:04:39.766
- Yeah. So, like, I personally
have never been in love.

1:04:39.784 --> 1:04:42.544
What is that feeling like?
I just really do not know.

1:04:42.621 --> 1:04:45.363
- Whenever I get to the point
where I care more about

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:48.441
Their time, their--
just them being happy

1:04:48.443 --> 1:04:50.368
Over me,
my time and me being happy,

1:04:50.387 --> 1:04:52.870
That's when I feel like,
"okay, you got me."

1:04:52.890 --> 1:04:55.891
- For me when I was in love,
I can be 100% vulnerable

1:04:55.967 --> 1:04:57.208
With them.

1:04:57.285 --> 1:04:59.394
- That's a good point, man.
- I wasn't scared

1:04:59.471 --> 1:05:01.454
To tell them anything.
- Right.

1:05:01.473 --> 1:05:02.380
- I think respect,
like, for me,

1:05:02.399 --> 1:05:04.232
It's like
the cornerstone of love.

1:05:04.309 --> 1:05:07.460
Once I respect somebody, like,
they've earned my respect,

1:05:07.479 --> 1:05:10.405
That's when I know I have the
capacity to love this person.

1:05:10.482 --> 1:05:11.814
- That's it, that's it.
- That's what I'm hoping for.

1:05:11.967 --> 1:05:13.575
- Please!
- That's it, that's it.

1:05:13.652 --> 1:05:16.077
- Who's going to go in
for the kiss at the altar?

1:05:16.154 --> 1:05:18.413
- Not me.
- No?

1:05:18.564 --> 1:05:20.807
- No? I want it.

1:05:20.809 --> 1:05:23.919

there and see what he does.

1:05:23.995 --> 1:05:25.086
- I'm going.
- You going in?

1:05:25.163 --> 1:05:26.254
- Oh, I'm going. I'm going.

1:05:26.406 --> 1:05:28.906
If he's not a troll,
yeah, I'm kissing him.

1:05:28.926 --> 1:05:30.074
- Yeah, yeah.

1:05:30.152 --> 1:05:33.577
- Well, I'm not.
I'm gonna take it slow.

1:05:33.597 --> 1:05:35.764

I'm not.

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:39.750

- This dress

1:12:06.305 --> 1:12:09.324
- Oh, my gosh.

1:12:10.568 --> 1:12:13.661
This morning, I felt like,
you know, and this is a lot,

1:12:13.738 --> 1:12:16.313
Like, I don't know
if I'm strong enough for this.

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:19.983
But let me tell you,
if I were not meant to do this,

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:22.653
Daddy and grandma thelma
would not have let me do it.

1:12:22.672 --> 1:12:24.397
- 100%.
- There was something

1:12:24.399 --> 1:12:27.066
That they saw
that they were like,

1:12:27.085 --> 1:12:29.177
"nah, she needs this."
- yeah.

1:12:29.253 --> 1:12:31.346
- My father and my grandmother,

1:12:31.422 --> 1:12:33.072
They died within months
of each other.

1:12:33.074 --> 1:12:34.849
My dad was killed
by a drunk driver,

1:12:34.926 --> 1:12:38.077
<i> My grandma</i>
<i> died of a broken heart.</i>

1:12:38.096 --> 1:12:39.854
And those were my people.

1:12:39.931 --> 1:12:42.190
<i> So going through this process,</i>

1:12:42.266 --> 1:12:44.100
<i> I know that</i>
<i> they're still around,</i>

1:12:44.252 --> 1:12:46.361
<i> And that if this</i>
<i> wasn't something</i>

1:12:46.437 --> 1:12:48.345
That I needed to experience,

1:12:48.365 --> 1:12:50.423
I know they wouldn't
never let me do this.

1:12:50.441 --> 1:12:51.515
I know that for a fact.

1:12:51.593 --> 1:12:53.534
I hope that I do
fall in love with him,

1:12:53.611 --> 1:12:57.263
And I really hope that
I'm capable of letting him in

1:12:57.265 --> 1:13:01.542
And not shutting him out and
being able to express myself.

1:13:01.619 --> 1:13:03.119
- I just want to reiterate,

1:13:03.271 --> 1:13:04.453
It's not gonna happen
overnight.

1:13:04.530 --> 1:13:06.864
I still struggle to open up
and be vulnerable.

1:13:06.883 --> 1:13:09.458
So give yourself some leeway.
Give yourself some slack, okay?

1:13:09.611 --> 1:13:12.612
- It's not gonna be easy.
Take your time.

1:13:12.614 --> 1:13:14.555
Don't rush.
What you rushing for?

1:13:16.375 --> 1:13:18.951
- Okay, okay.

1:13:18.953 --> 1:13:20.395
- Okay, okay. Hey, it's real.
Let's do it.

1:13:20.471 --> 1:13:23.789
- Yes, sir!
- [humming]

1:13:23.791 --> 1:13:25.066
[laughter]
- that's crazy, though.

1:13:25.143 --> 1:13:26.734
- Yes, sir!

1:13:26.886 --> 1:13:28.218
- I like this.
I like the style.

1:13:28.238 --> 1:13:29.795
I like the vest.

1:13:29.797 --> 1:13:33.074
- I'm trying to picture her
next to you in the dress, man.

1:13:33.151 --> 1:13:34.650
I'm trying to see how it looks.

1:13:34.727 --> 1:13:36.911
- Yeah, like, meeting her and
then, like, saying the vows,

1:13:36.988 --> 1:13:38.638
Like, to me,
that is the scariest part

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.748
Of this whole process.

1:13:40.825 --> 1:13:41.916
I just hope that I fit her,

1:13:42.067 --> 1:13:43.325
You know,
her standards, you know?

1:13:43.478 --> 1:13:44.977
- You're a free man, man.
- I know.

1:13:44.979 --> 1:13:47.755
But like, you know,
everything I do in life,

1:13:47.832 --> 1:13:49.239
I always think
it's not good enough.

1:13:49.259 --> 1:13:50.499
So that's why
I'm kind of thinking about,

1:13:50.576 --> 1:13:51.834
You know, what if I'm not
good enough for her?

1:13:51.911 --> 1:13:54.244
I mean, I know it's not
the best mindset to have,

1:13:54.264 --> 1:13:56.597
But I'm just nervous about,
like, the attraction,

1:13:56.674 --> 1:13:58.824
You know, because that is real.

1:13:58.843 --> 1:14:01.160
And so if she's not attracted
to me when she first sees me,

1:14:01.179 --> 1:14:02.937
Then I do think
it will be a challenge.

1:14:03.014 --> 1:14:04.997
People have their preferences
and, you know,

1:14:04.999 --> 1:14:06.274
What they're used to.

1:14:06.350 --> 1:14:08.443
What if I'm not, you know,
the height that she wants

1:14:08.519 --> 1:14:10.836
Or the body build she wants
or the skin color she wants?

1:14:10.838 --> 1:14:13.189
<i> It's just the honest truth.</i>

1:14:13.341 --> 1:14:14.782
<i> She may not be attracted</i>
<i> to me,</i>

1:14:14.934 --> 1:14:16.784
<i> And that would be</i>
<i> heartbreaking if she isn't.</i>

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.845
- What if you come down
the aisle and you see him,

1:14:19.864 --> 1:14:20.913
And you're like, "ugh!"

1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:23.624
- Oh, [bleep].
- We've been thinking about

1:14:23.701 --> 1:14:26.294
The other way, but
what if it happens that way?

1:14:27.538 --> 1:14:29.797
- Can you run in that dress?
- Yes, ma'am.

1:14:29.874 --> 1:14:30.965
I can run anything.
I'm squirrelly.

1:14:31.042 --> 1:14:32.800
- You can run in anything.

- Very simple.

1:14:54.732 --> 1:14:56.382
I'm just realizing
how meaningful it is

1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:59.735
To go wedding dress shopping
with the people I love.

1:14:59.887 --> 1:15:01.329
And in a way,
it's like getting married.

1:15:01.405 --> 1:15:03.647

1:15:11.341 --> 1:15:13.566
In a white power suit.

1:15:13.568 --> 1:15:15.067
- We're not running
for congress,

1:15:15.069 --> 1:15:16.569
So we're not doing that.

1:15:16.587 --> 1:15:17.995

But I want to feel like
it's me.

1:15:19.907 --> 1:15:21.516
I want to look beautiful
on my wedding day.

1:15:21.592 --> 1:15:23.100
- So no yoga pants.

1:15:24.912 --> 1:15:27.188
- Okay, maybe no yoga pants.
No fanny pack?

1:15:27.265 --> 1:15:30.173
- No.
- [laughs]

1:15:31.435 --> 1:15:33.419

And going in to get
tux-fitted today

1:15:49.712 --> 1:15:51.862
Kind of brings me back
on the right track.

- I don't know, man.
- I'll find your size.

1:15:53.941 --> 1:15:56.776
- Looking like
hugh hefner there.

1:15:56.794 --> 1:16:00.279
- Red in asian culture
is a lucky color.

1:16:00.298 --> 1:16:02.782
<i> And if I can control</i>
<i> the color of my suit</i>

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:04.617
To bring some luck
into the situation,

1:16:04.635 --> 1:16:07.119
I'm gonna do it because
I'm just tired of dating,

1:16:07.138 --> 1:16:08.563
And I don't want to date
anymore.

God, and they're deep pockets.

you'll ever wear?

1:16:57.188 --> 1:16:59.596
- Might be. I do like
this contrast right here.

1:16:59.616 --> 1:17:01.006
And maybe a different
color of bow

1:17:01.025 --> 1:17:03.266
But I mean,
I like this jacket a lot.

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:05.861

I can't wait to see like
what her personality is like.

1:17:17.024 --> 1:17:18.524
Is she quirky like me,

1:17:18.542 --> 1:17:20.784
Is she witty,
or is she really serious

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:22.194
I need to like soften her up
a little bit?

1:17:22.213 --> 1:17:24.196
<i> Is she really career-oriented</i>

1:17:24.215 --> 1:17:26.623
<i> Or is she more of, like,</i>
<i> a dreamer?</i>

And wants to be with me.

1:17:37.228 --> 1:17:39.136
Like, she's committed
to this as much as I have.

1:17:39.155 --> 1:17:41.304
And that's the thing
that excites me the most

1:17:41.324 --> 1:17:44.733
Is that we have that baseline
of commitment to one another.

1:17:44.886 --> 1:17:47.219
I mean, I don't expect this
to be easy.

1:17:47.238 --> 1:17:49.163
I don't expect this
to be like a walk in the park.

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:50.814
- You know, growing up
in the family that we did,

1:17:50.833 --> 1:17:53.726
We aren't very good
at expressing ourselves.

1:17:53.744 --> 1:17:56.337
We just have to be not afraid
to show ourselves, right?

1:17:56.414 --> 1:17:57.897
I mean, she's your wife,
she's the person

1:17:57.915 --> 1:17:59.732
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:03.402

him saying that,

1:18:06.849 --> 1:18:09.074
It plucks, like,
a little heartstring

1:18:09.093 --> 1:18:11.911
Because I wasn't hugged
as a child,

1:26:17.915 --> 1:26:19.231
Like, more reserved,

1:26:19.249 --> 1:26:21.508
As much as I'd love
to tear my pants up.

1:26:21.585 --> 1:26:24.011
- What are you guys most
nervous about in terms of,

1:26:24.087 --> 1:26:25.345
You know, after the wedding?

1:26:25.422 --> 1:26:26.571
- Think it's the intimacy.

1:26:26.573 --> 1:26:28.164
- But I'm looking more forward

1:26:28.184 --> 1:26:29.850
To the conversation,
like, after the wedding.

1:26:29.927 --> 1:26:31.576
You're gonna meet her
in that first sit-down,

1:26:31.595 --> 1:26:33.078
In that first conversation
and like

1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:34.521
What's your first question
gonna be?

1:26:34.598 --> 1:26:35.522
It's like, I don't know what
my first question's gonna be.

1:26:35.674 --> 1:26:36.690
- So I will say this.

1:26:36.767 --> 1:26:38.692
Here's what I have done
to combat, well,

1:26:38.769 --> 1:26:40.194
I wouldn't say combat that.

1:26:40.270 --> 1:26:41.586
I'll say, like, bridge the gap.

1:26:41.588 --> 1:26:43.922
So I wrote every
single question now

1:26:43.941 --> 1:26:45.199
That I have thought of.

1:26:45.275 --> 1:26:46.533
[laughter]
right?

1:26:46.685 --> 1:26:47.759
- Kinda funny, yeah.

1:26:47.761 --> 1:26:49.185
- How many questions
you got so far?

1:26:49.205 --> 1:26:52.539
- So it may be teasy,
it may be me crazy,

1:26:52.616 --> 1:26:54.433
But I wrote everything down.

1:26:54.451 --> 1:26:56.435
So there's 256 questions.

1:26:56.437 --> 1:26:58.937
- Oh!
- I already did it.

1:26:58.956 --> 1:27:00.714
I already did it.
I already did it.

1:27:00.791 --> 1:27:03.108
- I think jose needs a wife
that's gonna be like

1:27:03.110 --> 1:27:06.386
Affectionate and lets him know

1:27:06.463 --> 1:27:10.799
That he's appreciated
because he is unique.

1:27:10.951 --> 1:27:13.560
He's like a pokémon,
like unique pokémon over here.

1:27:13.637 --> 1:27:15.729
A rare pokémon,
and he needs somebody

1:27:15.806 --> 1:27:20.734
That is looking for that rare,
like, perfect fit for me.

1:27:20.811 --> 1:27:23.128
If I was a chick,
I'd be into jose.

1:27:23.130 --> 1:27:24.296
- When do you guys
think you'll cry?

1:27:24.298 --> 1:27:25.797
I personally think
I'm gonna cry when I--

1:27:25.816 --> 1:27:27.466
- I'm gonna cry during
my speeches, 100%.

1:27:27.468 --> 1:27:29.576
- Do you guys have--
- no question.

1:27:29.653 --> 1:27:30.652
- I just--

1:27:30.729 --> 1:27:32.804
- I don't think I'ma cry
not one time

1:27:32.806 --> 1:27:33.914
During this whole thing.

1:27:33.991 --> 1:27:35.082
[laughter]

1:27:35.233 --> 1:27:36.750
Look, if her vows--

1:27:36.901 --> 1:27:38.827
Her vows gotta be, like,
made by--

1:27:38.979 --> 1:27:40.587
Mother teresa...

1:27:40.664 --> 1:27:43.590
Might have to write
her vows for me to cry.

1:27:43.667 --> 1:27:45.650
- I practice my vows, practice
my vows every day, man.

1:27:45.652 --> 1:27:47.594
- Me crying?
You got it memorized?

1:27:47.671 --> 1:27:50.079
- I've had multiple goals
in life, but my main goal

1:27:50.099 --> 1:27:52.099
Has always been to have
a beautiful wife and kids.

1:27:52.250 --> 1:27:54.326
And so now I have
the opportunity to have that.

1:27:54.328 --> 1:27:56.103
And so...I want this.

That he might not

'cause I don't think I am

1:30:02.064 --> 1:30:04.064
You don't want a big [bleep]

That sucks.

Well, y'all know me.

This is probably the biggest

And...
<i> - Huge risk.</i>

1:31:20.717 --> 1:31:22.976

1:31:25.038 --> 1:31:26.980
Nothing is in control.

1:31:27.057 --> 1:31:32.152
<i> And for a guy that plans every</i>
<i> little aspect out in his life</i>

1:31:32.229 --> 1:31:35.155
And having a big question mark
over what's gonna happen

1:31:35.232 --> 1:31:37.716
The next few months,
that's very scary.

1:31:37.734 --> 1:31:39.826
I mean, I definitely am
going into this wedding day

1:31:39.903 --> 1:31:41.495
With a lot of insecurities.

1:31:41.646 --> 1:31:44.222
And one of the things
I'm kind of ashamed of is

1:31:44.241 --> 1:31:46.074
I kind of prefer
the needy girls,

1:31:46.226 --> 1:31:48.668
The girls that are clingy,
like, stage five clingers.

1:31:48.820 --> 1:31:51.171
Like, it gives me comfort.

1:31:51.322 --> 1:31:55.342
And when do I tell her
that that's what I want

1:31:55.418 --> 1:31:58.753
And that's what I need?
I don't want to scare her off.

1:31:58.905 --> 1:32:02.349
<i> - I definitely think that</i>
<i> you should take the time</i>

1:32:02.425 --> 1:32:04.743

<i> That you like</i>
<i> the stage five clingers.</i>

1:32:06.596 --> 1:32:09.356

<i> The need to get--</i>
<i> why you want somebody</i>

<i> To have all that attention</i>
<i> on you all the time?</i>

1:32:14.530 --> 1:32:17.272
- Every relationship
that I start, I always make it

1:32:17.424 --> 1:32:21.426
To where I make sure the girl
is really into me first.

1:32:21.444 --> 1:32:23.703
<i> Coming from a family</i>

1:32:26.950 --> 1:32:29.601

1:32:29.603 --> 1:32:31.378
<i> In looking for that</i>
<i> in relationships.</i>

1:32:31.454 --> 1:32:33.438
<i> I look for someone</i>
<i> that's hyper-affectionate.</i>

1:32:33.456 --> 1:32:35.273
<i> And I see it in other people,</i>

1:32:35.275 --> 1:32:36.716
<i> And I want to feel</i>
<i> that warmth.</i>

1:32:36.868 --> 1:32:39.052
<i> I want to feel that for the</i>
<i> person that I'm married to.</i>

1:32:43.708 --> 1:32:45.225
- How do you feel
about tomorrow?

1:32:45.376 --> 1:32:48.562
- It's weird. You know, like,
I haven't met this guy.

1:32:48.638 --> 1:32:51.565
I don't know how he looks.
I don't know his background.

1:32:51.641 --> 1:32:52.957
I don't know anything
about this guy

1:32:52.976 --> 1:32:54.401
Other than that he's a
human

1:32:54.477 --> 1:32:55.627
And he probably
won't have a micro penis

1:32:55.629 --> 1:32:57.237
Because I mentioned it
as a dealbreaker.

1:32:57.314 --> 1:32:59.072
[chuckling]

<i> I've been living with van</i>

<i> So I really need him</i>
<i> to give me some insight</i>

1:33:08.066 --> 1:33:10.975

1:33:12.662 --> 1:33:14.421

<i> Because there's so much</i>
<i> I don't have control over.</i>

1:33:16.166 --> 1:33:19.984
- What if he has, like,
a really overwhelming libido?

1:33:20.003 --> 1:33:22.262
- There's gonna be
a compromise.

1:33:22.339 --> 1:33:25.432
- He's just like, "I need it,
like, every day." yeah.

1:33:25.508 --> 1:33:29.269
- Mmm. But he's got a hand.
[laughter]

1:33:29.346 --> 1:33:32.439
In some weird way,
I trust the experts.

1:33:32.515 --> 1:33:36.334
Naturally, I'm optimistic, but
I'm cynical, and I'm skeptical.

1:33:36.353 --> 1:33:37.685
- Yeah.

1:33:37.838 --> 1:33:39.095
- I don't know
how his family is.

1:33:39.114 --> 1:33:42.340
And what if he has
a different background?

1:33:42.342 --> 1:33:45.101
Like, you know, my family,
you know,

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:48.847
We came from great adversity,
and there is

1:33:48.865 --> 1:33:52.533
Some insecurity there
with my parents and my family.

1:33:52.686 --> 1:33:54.519

he'll under--

1:33:54.537 --> 1:33:56.129
- No, that's the thing.

1:33:56.206 --> 1:33:58.798
Unless he has, like,
a real immigrant background,

1:33:58.875 --> 1:34:02.861
I cannot imagine that he will
understand how that feels.

When you talk about
refugee poor,

1:34:04.881 --> 1:34:07.641
That's like you came here
with absolutely nothing.

1:34:07.717 --> 1:34:11.961
Most of the people I've dated
don't know that I grew up

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:15.223
In a 50-plus year-old
dilapidated trailer.

1:34:15.375 --> 1:34:20.153
And for most of my life,
it was a big source of shame.

1:34:21.898 --> 1:34:25.325
It's gonna take some time
to be open about my upbringing.

1:34:25.476 --> 1:34:28.903
Like, I want to be sure that
there will be somebody there,

1:34:29.055 --> 1:34:31.406
In the long haul,
who's gonna be with me,

1:34:31.558 --> 1:34:33.057
That I can grow old with.

1:34:33.076 --> 1:34:35.001

1:34:35.078 --> 1:34:36.503
<i> Because the last thing</i>
<i> I would want</i>

1:34:36.579 --> 1:34:39.230
<i> Would be like for his family</i>
<i> to look down on my family</i>

1:34:39.249 --> 1:34:42.008
<i> Because of our</i>
<i> very humble beginnings.</i>

1:34:42.085 --> 1:34:44.569
I mean, at this point,
I don't know my husband,

1:34:44.587 --> 1:34:48.181
<i> And that is quite scary.</i>

1:34:49.685 --> 1:34:51.743
I do think I do read up
into things

1:34:51.745 --> 1:34:53.687
Sometimes more than I should,

1:34:53.763 --> 1:34:56.356
But it's something
that's so important to me.

1:34:56.433 --> 1:34:59.918

they're all I have.

"good night, husband."

1:35:14.617 --> 1:35:18.286

that my husband is tall,

1:35:18.438 --> 1:35:21.864
Dark and handsome, and
everything that I asked for,

1:35:21.883 --> 1:35:23.624

ask him a million questions

1:35:39.142 --> 1:35:41.735

1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:58.418
We got this.

1:35:58.495 --> 1:36:02.814

and sometimes I don't,

1:36:11.841 --> 1:36:14.826

Calm before the storm,
if you will.

1:36:16.513 --> 1:36:19.421

where I'm kind of nervous,

1:36:19.441 --> 1:36:20.273

1:36:20.350 --> 1:36:22.776

Going to change
in basically a second.

1:36:26.931 --> 1:36:31.509

have to tell my husband is,

1:36:31.511 --> 1:36:35.013
"hi. My name is rachel."

1:36:35.015 --> 1:36:39.017
I want to smile
and just be happy,

But I think my emotions are
just gonna get the best of me

1:36:42.038 --> 1:36:43.521
And I'm so scared,

1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:46.299
I'm just going to be crying
the whole time.

1:36:46.376 --> 1:36:51.362

you hug whatever pillow

1:36:53.475 --> 1:36:55.033

1:36:55.035 --> 1:36:57.035
Give him
one last nice tight squeeze

1:36:57.053 --> 1:36:58.812
And then kiss him goodbye

1:36:58.888 --> 1:37:02.223

1:38:31.631 --> 1:38:33.131

have got to be

- Oh, boy.
- Johnny.

1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:51.156
- You can go first.

1:53:51.233 --> 1:53:53.992
- Please recite your vows
to bao.

1:53:54.144 --> 1:53:56.903

the revisions over here.

1:53:57.056 --> 1:54:00.073
[bao laughs]

1:54:00.225 --> 1:54:03.560
To my wife, bao,
I met you only minutes

1:54:03.579 --> 1:54:05.838
Plus many many years ago.

1:54:05.989 --> 1:54:08.006
[laughter]
but by simply being here,

1:54:08.158 --> 1:54:09.675
Standing across
from each other today

1:54:09.826 --> 1:54:11.418
In front of our family
and friends,

1:54:11.570 --> 1:54:13.345
I get the feeling we already
have a few things in common.

1:54:13.496 --> 1:54:15.514
Most importantly,
we're both at a stage in life

1:54:15.591 --> 1:54:17.574
That we're willing
to risk it all

1:54:17.593 --> 1:54:19.518
To find our spouse,
or better half,

1:54:19.669 --> 1:54:21.353
Our first and forever date.

1:54:21.504 --> 1:54:23.188
I will work every day

1:54:23.340 --> 1:54:24.764
To prove to you the risk
was well worth the reward.

1:54:24.917 --> 1:54:26.433
I promise to keep
our conversations

1:54:26.585 --> 1:54:29.361
Full of witty observations,
bad puns, and inside jokes.

1:54:29.512 --> 1:54:31.088
- Yes!
- I vow to patiently

1:54:31.106 --> 1:54:33.198
Listen to you and lift you up
when you're down

1:54:33.350 --> 1:54:36.535
And be mr. Glass-half-full
on days that feel half empty.

1:54:36.686 --> 1:54:39.596
I hereby give you a coupon for
an endless supply of affection.

1:54:39.615 --> 1:54:42.541
I'll snuggle you
when you're cold

1:54:42.692 --> 1:54:44.543
And then roll back to my side
if it gets too hot.

1:54:44.694 --> 1:54:46.603
I promise that throughout
our journey together,

1:54:46.605 --> 1:54:49.106
I'm going to respect you,
honor our marriage

1:54:49.124 --> 1:54:51.717
And give my whole heart
to being the husband

1:54:51.868 --> 1:54:53.110
You want and deserve.

1:54:53.128 --> 1:54:56.221
I'm all yours.
- Oh, so sweet.

1:54:56.373 --> 1:54:59.892
- Bao, please recite
your vows to johnny.

1:55:01.544 --> 1:55:04.621
- I wrote a poem.
- Oh, I like poems.

1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:07.566
- It's titled, we will.

1:55:07.717 --> 1:55:12.070
Dear johnny, we finally meet.

1:55:12.222 --> 1:55:14.722
You're in for a treat.

1:55:14.742 --> 1:55:19.319
The path that led us here,
I must confess,

1:55:19.471 --> 1:55:24.082
Can hardly be described
as perfect or fun.

1:55:24.159 --> 1:55:26.476
We braved
so many grueling tests,

1:55:26.495 --> 1:55:30.313
And today we know
it's worth it and done.

1:55:30.332 --> 1:55:34.651
We will celebrate the fancy
and the cheesy.

1:55:34.653 --> 1:55:38.155
Laughing and dancing
in a world of our own,

1:55:38.157 --> 1:55:41.324
And care for one another
in times less easy,

1:55:41.343 --> 1:55:45.845
Returning always to our space
we call home.

1:55:45.998 --> 1:55:50.943
We will travel
while we're nimble and spry,

1:55:51.094 --> 1:55:55.113
Or sit hand-in-hand
and watch paint dry,

1:55:55.265 --> 1:56:00.118
Just content in knowing
that our love is growing

1:56:00.195 --> 1:56:05.791
With the rise and the fall,
together, through it all.

1:56:05.942 --> 1:56:10.295
We have each other today,
and hopefully, always,

1:56:10.447 --> 1:56:16.969
I can say I found my one
and only, no longer lonely.

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:20.697
- Thank you.

1:56:20.716 --> 1:56:25.143

- Oh, your hand's cold.

1:56:28.707 --> 1:56:31.057

2:03:31.146 --> 2:03:33.405
I just want to find out
how much more we have in common.

2:03:33.481 --> 2:03:36.074
Were you ever on, like,
dating apps and stuff?

2:03:36.225 --> 2:03:38.651
- I have.
- You swiped left on me?

2:03:38.803 --> 2:03:41.971
- No, I don't.
I never swiped left on you.

2:03:41.990 --> 2:03:44.974
I kept you
in the list of maybes.

2:03:44.993 --> 2:03:48.661
You've always been in the list
of maybes on all of the apps.

2:03:48.813 --> 2:03:51.423
- I am so honored. Wow.

2:03:51.574 --> 2:03:53.149
- 'cause it's just like,
you know,

2:03:53.168 --> 2:03:56.428
Like, when you know somebody,
you feel bad about swiping left

2:03:56.579 --> 2:03:59.431
So then I'm just gonna
leave them in the, like--

2:03:59.507 --> 2:04:00.932
- You could have saved us
a lot of time

2:04:01.083 --> 2:04:04.436
Just by sending me a like.

2:04:04.512 --> 2:04:09.256
So I do have a plan
for something after this,

2:04:09.276 --> 2:04:11.834
Something my family
does at every wedding.

2:04:11.853 --> 2:04:15.930
We have done, at some point,
a tea ceremony.

2:04:15.949 --> 2:04:17.840
And I would love to continue
that tradition

2:04:17.859 --> 2:04:19.175
With our marriage

2:04:19.177 --> 2:04:22.011
And see if we can present
some tea to the family

2:04:22.013 --> 2:04:23.846
And get their blessings.

2:04:23.848 --> 2:04:24.956
- That's what you wanted
to tell me?

2:04:25.033 --> 2:04:25.940
- I want to do that.

2:04:25.959 --> 2:04:27.274
- Oh, okay.
- Can you do that?

2:04:27.352 --> 2:04:30.462
- Oh, yeah. Actually,
what I wanted to tell you

2:04:30.538 --> 2:04:32.964
Is that I insisted
on a tea ceremony.

2:04:33.041 --> 2:04:36.693
- Hey. Okay.

2:04:36.711 --> 2:04:38.970
This day has been
a fairy tale come true.

2:04:39.121 --> 2:04:40.972

Yeah, I mean, she's the one that
would have made sense all along.

2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:56.229
We're totally compatible.
