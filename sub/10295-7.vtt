00:25.235 --> 00:29.200

00:29.235 --> 00:31.133

00:34.068 --> 00:38.934
* Love and marriage *

00:38.969 --> 00:40.334

00:40.369 --> 00:42.734

00:42.769 --> 00:46.501

00:46.536 --> 00:51.067

00:51.102 --> 00:55.868

To separate them *

01:17.969 --> 01:19.434
One minute!

01:24.968 --> 01:27.467
Will you please
turn it down?

01:30.003 --> 01:31.167
Thanks.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.767
Turn it off!

01:42.969 --> 01:44.801
I'm sorry.

01:44.836 --> 01:47.200
You have no idea
what it's like

01:47.235 --> 01:49.133
having music
blaring all day long.

01:49.168 --> 01:50.634
Yes, we do.

01:50.669 --> 01:52.667
That's why we came over.

01:52.702 --> 01:53.868
I'm sorry.

01:53.903 --> 01:55.300
It's just that the kids

01:55.335 --> 01:56.667
were home sick
from school today.

01:56.702 --> 01:58.501
Nothing serious,
I hope.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.167
No, just one of those bugs
that goes around.

02:01.202 --> 02:03.033
You know, where they're sick
for two hours,

02:03.068 --> 02:06.000
then they make you sick
for the rest of your life.

02:06.035 --> 02:07.501
Coffee?

02:07.536 --> 02:09.000
No.
No.

02:09.035 --> 02:12.400
Steve and I can't wait
until we have kids.

02:12.435 --> 02:13.901
Giving birth
to a child must be

02:13.936 --> 02:16.400
one of the most
beautiful experiences

02:16.435 --> 02:18.300
in God's universe.

02:18.335 --> 02:19.901
I wouldn't know.

02:19.936 --> 02:22.267
I was unconscious
for a week.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.968
I kind of miss that.

02:27.901 --> 02:29.400
Mom!

02:29.435 --> 02:32.434
Kelly tied my face
to the speaker!

02:34.969 --> 02:36.434
Ma!

02:36.469 --> 02:37.734
Excuse me.

02:43.868 --> 02:45.367
The mistakes she's making!

02:45.402 --> 02:49.367
Maybe we should loan her
some of our child-rearing books!

02:49.402 --> 02:50.868
I don't know,
Marcie!

02:50.903 --> 02:53.367
I don't think Al and Peggy
read much!

02:57.467 --> 03:01.868
I wish we could spend
more time with Bud and Kelly.

03:01.903 --> 03:02.934
I just know we'd have

03:02.969 --> 03:05.467
such a positive, creative
influence on them.

03:05.502 --> 03:08.334
And if I hear another peep
out of you two,

03:08.369 --> 03:11.801
I am gonna tie
your throats together.

03:11.836 --> 03:13.601
Well, that's
pretty creative.

03:13.636 --> 03:16.100
I'm sorry you had
to be here for this.

03:16.135 --> 03:18.100
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

03:18.135 --> 03:19.601
Kids aren't so bad.

03:19.636 --> 03:21.467
I remember,
one Mother's Day,

03:21.502 --> 03:23.734
they surprised me
with the sweetest...

03:23.769 --> 03:26.234
Oh, no,
that wasn't them.

03:26.269 --> 03:27.901
I saw that on TV.

03:29.701 --> 03:31.067
Oh, Peggy.

03:31.102 --> 03:33.567
You know, it sounds like
you need to get away.

03:33.602 --> 03:34.834
I thought about that,

03:34.869 --> 03:36.501
but then Al and the kids

03:36.536 --> 03:39.601
would just hunt me down
and drag me back.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.133
No, I meant
for a vacation.

03:42.168 --> 03:44.634
Hire a babysitter
and take off for the weekend.

03:44.669 --> 03:46.634
We used to have
babysitters,

03:46.669 --> 03:49.467
but word of mouth
kills you.

03:49.502 --> 03:50.934
What about your relatives?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.701
Again, it's that
word of mouth thing.

03:53.736 --> 03:55.701
Well, if you really want
to get out of town,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.901
we wouldn't mind taking
the kids for a weekend,

03:57.936 --> 03:59.000
Would we, Steve?

03:59.035 --> 04:00.701
Well, I...
The ones upstairs?

04:00.736 --> 04:02.200
It would be fun.

04:02.235 --> 04:06.200
It would be good practice
for when we have children.

04:06.235 --> 04:07.701
You wouldn't mind?

04:10.334 --> 04:11.868
Of course not.

04:14.601 --> 04:17.200
Oh, hi, honey. Look,
Steve and Marcie are here.

04:17.235 --> 04:18.634
Yeah, I know.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.634
I've been
circling the block

04:20.668 --> 04:23.467
waiting for them
to leave,

04:23.502 --> 04:26.467
but I finally
ran out of gas.

04:26.502 --> 04:29.901
Well, they've agreed to take
the kids for the weekend.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.133
Great!

04:31.168 --> 04:33.534
Yeah, so you and me
can go away by ourselves.

04:33.569 --> 04:35.634
You mean
we have to leave?

04:35.669 --> 04:38.567
Gee, it sounded good
for a second.

04:38.602 --> 04:41.067
Come on, Al, we never get
to go anywhere.

04:41.102 --> 04:44.100
Honey, if I wanted to
go away, even with you,

04:44.135 --> 04:46.100
it wouldn't be
this weekend.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.601
The fight's on Saturday.

04:47.636 --> 04:48.601
Oh, Al.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.100
You always
watch sports.

04:50.135 --> 04:51.601
Well, not this weekend!

04:51.636 --> 04:53.100
We're going away.

04:53.135 --> 04:54.601
I'm watching the fight.

04:54.636 --> 04:56.100
You're not watching
the fight.

04:56.135 --> 04:57.601
I'm watching the fight!

04:57.636 --> 04:59.067
You're not watching
the fight, Al.

04:59.102 --> 05:00.467
Oh, really, dear?

05:01.767 --> 05:04.767
It's not being carried
on network TV.

05:04.802 --> 05:06.267
It's only on cable.

05:06.302 --> 05:07.801
Ha! And we don't
have cable TV.

05:07.836 --> 05:09.267
Well, that settles it.

05:09.302 --> 05:11.767
Come on, Marcie,
let's get the phone book

05:11.802 --> 05:14.033
and pick a nice, cheap
little love nest.

05:15.434 --> 05:16.934
This was your idea?

05:16.969 --> 05:18.167
No.

05:18.202 --> 05:19.667
I can't believe it.

05:19.702 --> 05:22.033
The entire weekend I have
to spend alone with my wife.

05:22.068 --> 05:23.667
Steve, you are
the biggest-

05:23.702 --> 05:25.167
By the way,
do you have cable?

05:25.202 --> 05:26.367
No.

05:26.402 --> 05:29.033
The biggest idiot
I ever met!

05:30.434 --> 05:31.968
You got me into this.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.834
The entire weekend
alone with my wife.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.400
Al, why don't you just go.
Relax. Enjoy yourself.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.400
Steve, look out
in the kitchen there.

05:38.435 --> 05:39.767
You see that redhead?

05:43.234 --> 05:45.667
Try to picture her
in heat.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.400
I'm sorry, Al.

05:51.435 --> 05:55.334
Yeah. That and a dime will
get you a cup of coffee.

05:55.369 --> 05:56.334
Where, Al?

05:56.369 --> 05:57.601
Shut up.

05:57.636 --> 06:00.000
I gotta think. I gotta find
a place to watch the fight

06:00.035 --> 06:01.567
so I can get out
of this.

06:01.602 --> 06:04.334
Al, I got the answer
to all your problems.

06:04.369 --> 06:06.601
Well, not all your problems,
but this problem.

06:06.636 --> 06:08.968
The fight is being carried
on Spectravision,

06:09.003 --> 06:10.667
and I know
who's got it.

06:10.702 --> 06:11.934
This little place

06:11.969 --> 06:14.334
right across the state
line in Wisconsin,

06:14.369 --> 06:16.334
the Come 'n' Go motel.

06:18.834 --> 06:22.467
How would you know
about a place like that?

06:22.502 --> 06:25.334
I've come and gone
a few times.

06:25.369 --> 06:26.367
With Marcie?

06:26.402 --> 06:27.834
Well, actually,
before Marcie.

06:27.869 --> 06:29.968
You dog, you.

06:30.003 --> 06:31.868
Now, don't say anything
to Marcie.

06:31.903 --> 06:33.400
I wouldn't want her
to find out

06:33.435 --> 06:35.467
about some of the wild oats
I sowed.

06:35.502 --> 06:37.234
So this is
just between us, okay?

06:37.269 --> 06:38.734
Sure. Hey, Peg,

06:38.769 --> 06:40.834
Steve just recommended
this little place,

06:40.869 --> 06:42.567
the Come 'n' Go motel!

06:42.602 --> 06:44.834
He says it's
a real passion pit!

06:46.234 --> 06:49.467
I don't remember us
going there, Steve.

06:51.234 --> 06:52.701
Marcie!

06:52.736 --> 06:56.100
I can't believe
you forgot that night.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.601
I don't know
where my mind is.

07:01.636 --> 07:03.100
I'm sorry, Steve.

07:03.135 --> 07:05.701
I should hope so.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.200
But I forgive you.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.434
You're really
gonna love this place.

07:14.469 --> 07:15.934
Oh, gee,
it sounds great.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.467
I'm gonna make
the reservation right now.

07:18.502 --> 07:19.934
That was beautiful,
Steve.

07:19.969 --> 07:22.868
Oh, thanks, Al. And thanks
for selling me out too.

07:22.903 --> 07:24.167
No problem.

07:24.202 --> 07:26.467
Now, listen, this is gonna
work out great for me,

07:26.502 --> 07:28.534
except for one thing.

07:28.569 --> 07:31.767
She's gonna want some sex.

07:31.802 --> 07:35.367
Now, do I watch the fight first,
then give her a jump?

07:37.234 --> 07:40.367
No. No, that's no good,
because with that on my mind,

07:40.402 --> 07:41.868
I'll be all anxious
and tense.

07:41.903 --> 07:44.000
I won't be able
to enjoy the fight. No.

07:44.035 --> 07:47.033
Best thing to do would be
to bed her down first.

07:47.068 --> 07:49.834
That way, I'll enjoy
the rest of the day.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.767
Now, let's see...
Fight comes on at 5:00,

07:51.802 --> 07:53.667
figure a half-hour
for the drive,

07:53.702 --> 07:54.868
check-in, 10 minutes,

07:54.903 --> 07:57.100
another five minutes
to go to the bathroom,

07:57.135 --> 07:59.467
then I pleasure Peg.

07:59.502 --> 08:00.934
That should give me
enough time

08:00.969 --> 08:03.701
to shower, eat, and get ready
to have a good time.

08:03.736 --> 08:05.467
I love you, Al.

08:05.502 --> 08:08.300
Right back at you.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.100
I'm really looking
forward to this.

08:16.135 --> 08:18.334
I think we'll learn a lot
about raising children

08:18.369 --> 08:20.501
and they'll learn a lot
about being themselves,

08:20.536 --> 08:23.534
and if we run into any problems,
we'll get the answer.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.367
One thing's for sure.

08:25.402 --> 08:27.601
It will be a nice change
for the kids.

08:27.636 --> 08:29.968
You have no vote!
You're staying with them!

08:32.299 --> 08:34.667
But, Dad, they're gross.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.133
It's not my fault
they moved in next door.

08:39.168 --> 08:42.000
Shut up, Al.
They have their uses.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.074

08:51.834 --> 08:54.834
This is very nice
of you two.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.200
Oh, it's
our pleasure.

08:58.334 --> 09:00.834
The dog too.

09:00.869 --> 09:03.133
Better and better.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.100
Now, Marcie, here's a list
of dos and don'ts.

09:06.135 --> 09:08.701
And a very special don't:
No parties.

09:08.736 --> 09:10.000
Mom.

09:10.035 --> 09:11.300
Especially Kelly.

09:11.335 --> 09:13.234
It's a promise
we made the police.

09:14.534 --> 09:17.434
Come on, Peg. We should've left
two minutes ago.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.934
Ooh, you're anxious.

09:18.969 --> 09:20.801
More than
you can imagine.

09:24.367 --> 09:27.868
Well, kids, I think your parents
are really gonna miss you.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.234
Al, wait for me!

09:40.868 --> 09:43.367
Now, Bud, Kelly...

09:43.402 --> 09:45.167
don't think of us
as babysitters.

09:45.202 --> 09:47.100
Think of us
as best friends.

09:47.135 --> 09:49.267
Steve, would you like
to tell our best friends

09:49.302 --> 09:50.667
what we have
for them?

09:50.702 --> 09:52.434
Not really, Marcie.

09:52.469 --> 09:53.934
Then I will.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.434
We have art projects

09:55.469 --> 09:58.434
<i>and a game recommended
by Psychology Today.</i>

09:58.469 --> 10:00.934
It's a game
of role playing.

10:00.969 --> 10:03.267
I'm gonna
make a call.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.801
I'm gonna use
your bathroom.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.467
We're having some fun now,
huh, Marce?

10:09.502 --> 10:11.834
I hope you're not gonna
be this way

10:11.869 --> 10:13.033
with our children.

10:13.068 --> 10:16.234
I'm hoping our children
will like us.

10:16.269 --> 10:18.367
These children
like us.

10:18.402 --> 10:21.534
No, I'm at
these dorks' house.

10:21.569 --> 10:24.067
Yeah, give everybody
this number.

10:24.102 --> 10:26.067
They can call as late
as they want to.

10:26.102 --> 10:27.334
It's like death here.

10:28.601 --> 10:30.100
Well,
all in all,

10:30.135 --> 10:32.434
I think it's gonna
turn out just fine.

10:32.469 --> 10:34.801
Hey, Kelly, look!

10:34.836 --> 10:38.934
Even Mrs. Rhoades has
a bigger bra size than you.

10:46.734 --> 10:49.734
Oh, gee!
The room is beautiful.

10:49.769 --> 10:51.567
Get in
the bed, Peg.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.667
Al!

10:54.702 --> 10:56.167
Peg, it's almost 5:00.

10:56.202 --> 10:57.434
I can't believe
the traffic.

10:57.469 --> 10:58.801
Why does everybody
always stop

10:58.836 --> 11:00.234
and watch somebody
change a tire?

11:00.269 --> 11:01.767
When I wait in traffic
that long,

11:01.802 --> 11:03.767
the least they can show me
is some mangled bodies.

11:03.802 --> 11:05.200
Get in the bed, Peg.

11:05.235 --> 11:06.300
Take it easy, honey.

11:06.335 --> 11:07.801
We have all night.

11:07.836 --> 11:10.300
But I love you, Peg,
and time's a-wasting. Let's go.

11:10.335 --> 11:13.234
Wait. Let me check
one thing.

11:13.269 --> 11:14.734
Ah! Spectravision.

11:14.769 --> 11:16.734
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.434
Wait, wait.
We promised the kids

11:18.469 --> 11:20.100
we'd call them
when we got here.

11:21.734 --> 11:23.234
I don't know.

11:23.269 --> 11:24.734
The mood is fading.

11:24.769 --> 11:27.701
Gee, I've been
there before.

11:27.736 --> 11:29.133
I'm ready.

11:32.267 --> 11:35.267
You know, Peg, this is nice,
just the two of us.

11:35.302 --> 11:37.267
We don't have to rush

11:37.302 --> 11:40.267
because we're worried the kids
are gonna be coming in.

11:40.302 --> 11:41.701
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

11:41.736 --> 11:44.634
<i>Would you please rise
for our national anthem?</i>

11:48.267 --> 11:50.767
"I am the father
of French impressionism.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.067
Who am I?"

11:54.200 --> 11:57.067
Now, Marcie, let's give
the kids a chance.

12:00.234 --> 12:01.501
Marcie?

12:01.536 --> 12:04.234
Edouard Manet.

12:04.269 --> 12:05.667
Right.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.100
Marcie and I have
200 points each

12:10.135 --> 12:11.601
and you have none.
Ha, ha.

12:11.636 --> 12:13.968
This sucks, Marcie.

12:14.003 --> 12:15.634
Oh, very good, Steve.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.000
Did it ever occur
to you

12:17.035 --> 12:19.033
that you're setting the tone
for the entire day?

12:19.068 --> 12:20.868
If you're negative,
they'll be negative.

12:20.903 --> 12:23.300
If I leave,
will they leave?

12:23.335 --> 12:27.033
You, my friend, are losing
fatherhood points.

12:27.068 --> 12:29.534
Besides, they're not
bothering anybody.

12:29.569 --> 12:32.434
Come on, Buck!
Time to play fox hunt!

12:34.734 --> 12:36.100
That's my fur!

12:37.734 --> 12:39.100
That's my fur!

12:40.234 --> 12:42.234
Your engagement present?

12:42.269 --> 12:44.234
Bud, get out here!

12:44.269 --> 12:46.734
Now, Steve,
let me handle this.

12:46.769 --> 12:49.601
You're just upset
because you paid for it.

12:52.834 --> 12:57.167
Now, Bud, you know what you did
was wrong, don't you?

12:57.202 --> 12:59.133
Yes, ma'am.

12:59.168 --> 13:01.667
Good.
That will be all.

13:01.702 --> 13:03.067
That will be all?
No.

13:03.102 --> 13:05.033
Just wait until
I get this belt off,

13:05.068 --> 13:06.701
<i>and that
will be all.</i>

13:06.736 --> 13:08.200
Steve! We're sorry.

13:08.235 --> 13:09.701
We're sorry.
You bet we're sorry.

13:09.736 --> 13:11.701
Sorry we ever
moved next door

13:11.736 --> 13:13.567
to the devil's
spawning ground.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.434
Can I go play now?

13:16.469 --> 13:17.534
Yes, sure.

13:17.569 --> 13:19.033
Come on, Buck!

13:19.068 --> 13:20.534
Time for pearl diving!

13:20.569 --> 13:21.901
Pearl diving?

13:23.734 --> 13:25.167
Bye,
Mr. Rhoades.

13:25.202 --> 13:26.634
Whoa.
Where you going?

13:26.669 --> 13:28.300
Out, where
there's life.

13:28.335 --> 13:29.601
No, you're not.

13:29.636 --> 13:32.000
Your mother said if you were
too sick to go to school,

13:32.035 --> 13:33.200
you're too sick to go out.

13:33.235 --> 13:35.567
Well, how about
if I have a party over here?

13:35.602 --> 13:37.200
No parties.

13:37.235 --> 13:41.234
I think I saved most of
our valuable stuff, Steve,

13:41.269 --> 13:43.934
And the rest
I'm sure will dry.

13:43.969 --> 13:46.567
Um, Mrs. Rhoades,

13:46.602 --> 13:49.200
Mr. Rhoades said that
if it's okay with you

13:49.235 --> 13:50.367
that I can have a party.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.167
Oh, nice, Steve.
Make me the bad guy.

13:57.202 --> 13:59.667
You heard Peggy say
no parties.

13:59.702 --> 14:02.501
You have me deeply
concerned, Steven.

14:02.536 --> 14:04.200
Well, if I can't have
a party,

14:04.235 --> 14:06.267
can I at least have
a couple of friends over?

14:06.302 --> 14:07.767
I don't see
the harm in that.

14:07.802 --> 14:08.767
Do you, Steve?

14:08.802 --> 14:10.267
Yes, I do.

14:10.302 --> 14:11.801
Sure. Go ahead
and call them.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.868
I already did.

14:16.567 --> 14:19.033
Listen, I really like
one of these guys.

14:19.068 --> 14:20.100
He's real nice,

14:20.135 --> 14:23.133
but don't make
any sudden moves, okay?

14:24.701 --> 14:27.567
I guess I can
dial 911 slowly.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.534
Hi.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.200
Hey.
Hey.
Hmm.

14:32.235 --> 14:34.701
This is Sean,
Debbie, and Dweep.

14:34.736 --> 14:36.701
Dweep just
got out.

14:36.736 --> 14:41.634
Human life
means nothing to me.

14:41.669 --> 14:43.067
Marcie.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.234
It's nice
to meet you.

14:47.269 --> 14:50.133
Just let me spread
out some paper,

14:50.168 --> 14:52.133
and we can all
sit down.

14:52.168 --> 14:57.167
Hey, we was playing
eyesies closies driving in.

14:57.202 --> 15:00.300
I think you need
a new mailbox.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.367
Uh, Marcie, I think
we're low on milk.

15:04.402 --> 15:06.200
I'm just gonna run over
to Wisconsin

15:06.235 --> 15:08.267
and pick some up.

15:08.302 --> 15:09.534
Freeze!

15:12.834 --> 15:14.834
Come on, Ramirez!
Hook him!

15:14.869 --> 15:17.334
Low! High! Cross!
You got him!

15:17.369 --> 15:18.734
You got him!

15:20.100 --> 15:21.133
Get up!

15:22.434 --> 15:23.767
Come on, get up!

15:23.802 --> 15:25.634
Attaboy! He's up!

15:25.669 --> 15:27.100
Oh!

15:27.135 --> 15:28.801
<i>Ramirez never
should have got up.</i>

15:29.934 --> 15:30.934
<i>Eight...</i>

15:30.969 --> 15:31.934
<i>Nine...</i>

15:31.969 --> 15:33.100
<i>10.</i>

15:33.135 --> 15:35.534
<i>It's over!
Wow, what a fight!</i>

15:37.701 --> 15:39.701
* 10 cents a dance *

15:39.736 --> 15:42.100
* That's what
They pay me **

15:42.135 --> 15:43.434
Hi, Al.

15:43.469 --> 15:46.434
I found a lot
of nice things today.

15:46.469 --> 15:49.434
You know, I know
we have Kmarts at home,

15:49.469 --> 15:50.934
but there is
something so special

15:50.969 --> 15:53.501
about going out of town
to shop at one.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.901
This is great, honey.

15:56.936 --> 15:58.067
Yeah.

15:58.102 --> 16:00.567
I think
the national anthem

16:00.602 --> 16:03.434
should be our song
from now on.

16:04.901 --> 16:08.067
When they hit
"the rockets' red glare,"

16:08.102 --> 16:12.067
you were an animal, Al.

16:12.102 --> 16:13.934
I love
this country, Peg.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.901
You know, it's so nice
being here alone,

16:17.936 --> 16:19.901
just the two of us.

16:19.936 --> 16:21.901
I know. But you
know something, Al?

16:21.936 --> 16:24.400
I never thought
I'd say this this soon,

16:24.435 --> 16:26.434
but I miss the kids.

16:26.469 --> 16:27.601
What kids?

16:27.636 --> 16:30.100
Ours. The boy
and the girl, remember?

16:30.135 --> 16:32.100
Listen, honey,
we've had a great time,

16:32.135 --> 16:34.100
but we don't need
to stay the night.

16:34.135 --> 16:36.100
Why don't I call
Steve and Marcie

16:36.135 --> 16:37.667
and tell them
we're coming home early.

16:37.702 --> 16:41.300
Unless you want
to do it again.

16:43.767 --> 16:44.801
Sorry.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.200
Well, Dweep,
sure it's a nice ring,

16:50.235 --> 16:52.200
but I think
that's why

16:52.235 --> 16:54.067
they lock cemeteries
at night.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.801
Shall we change
the subject?

16:59.836 --> 17:01.133
Debbie-

17:01.168 --> 17:05.300
Sean, where are you
planning to attend college?

17:05.335 --> 17:08.133
Oh, well, I was hoping
to get a government job,

17:08.167 --> 17:09.968
you know, so I could
sell secrets.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.467
I love you, Sean.

17:11.502 --> 17:15.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.634
So, what's
the plan?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.634
Are we just supposed
to sit here

17:18.669 --> 17:21.733
and wait for these two
to doze off or something?

17:22.935 --> 17:24.800
I'll get it!
I'll get it!

17:26.067 --> 17:27.400
Hello.

17:27.435 --> 17:29.033
Peggy! Hi!

17:30.400 --> 17:31.901
Yeah, we're still here.

17:31.936 --> 17:33.300
How are you doing?

17:34.601 --> 17:36.100
You are?
That's great!

17:36.135 --> 17:37.267
What?

17:37.302 --> 17:38.767
They're coming home!

17:38.802 --> 17:40.767
Oh, thank goodness!
Thank goodness!

17:40.802 --> 17:43.434
You'll be home
in an hour?

17:43.469 --> 17:45.534
Hold on one second.

17:50.267 --> 17:51.267
I'm back.

17:52.534 --> 17:55.033
No, no. It's been
our pleasure.

17:55.068 --> 17:56.367
They've been
little angels.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.267
No problems at all.

18:03.302 --> 18:04.734
Don't rush.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.300
Yeah!

18:09.335 --> 18:10.968
Don't rush, Steve?

18:11.003 --> 18:12.467
Look at them.

18:12.502 --> 18:14.267
It'll be dark
in an hour.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.200
Doesn't matter.
They're coming home.

18:19.235 --> 18:21.968
They're gonna take
these little heathens away!

18:24.300 --> 18:27.167
I can't believe you
told Peggy, "No problem."

18:27.202 --> 18:28.467
What do you think's gonna happen

18:28.502 --> 18:30.567
the next time
they wanna go out of town?

18:30.602 --> 18:33.400
They'll expect us
to take the kids again

18:33.435 --> 18:36.234
because we did
such a good job.

18:36.269 --> 18:38.767
Next time, it might be
for a week.

18:38.802 --> 18:40.267
Then a month.

18:40.302 --> 18:43.634
And then one day,
they won't come back at all.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.434
We'll just say no.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.934
And then we'll be
the bad guys,

18:48.969 --> 18:50.434
the bad neighbors.

18:50.469 --> 18:51.868
No. They have to see

18:51.903 --> 18:54.701
we're not fit to care
for the little demons.

18:54.736 --> 18:57.400
We're bored.
Why can't we have a party?

18:57.435 --> 18:59.968
Because your mother
specifically said no parties.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.467
That's right. She did.

19:01.502 --> 19:03.968
And if we were
good babysitters,

19:04.003 --> 19:05.968
the kind
people use again,

19:06.003 --> 19:07.300
we'd have to say no.

19:09.434 --> 19:11.434
Yes, of course
you can have a party.

19:11.469 --> 19:14.968
Can you get one together
in less than an hour?

19:15.003 --> 19:16.133
Sure.

19:16.168 --> 19:17.634
Well, go for it.

19:17.669 --> 19:20.133
Uh, Marcie, tell me
this is your plan:

19:20.168 --> 19:22.133
You're gonna get them
all together

19:22.168 --> 19:24.267
and blow them up, right?

19:24.302 --> 19:26.267
No. This
is better, Steve.

19:26.302 --> 19:27.767
Just as the party's
starting,

19:27.802 --> 19:29.267
Al and Peggy will be here.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.367
And they'll see this wild party
starring Dweep,

19:31.402 --> 19:33.133
and they'll know
we're unfit.

19:33.168 --> 19:34.501
And they'll never ask us

19:34.536 --> 19:36.634
to care for their
precious offspring again.

19:36.669 --> 19:39.567
Good news. Raven and
the Bloody 10 are coming.

19:39.602 --> 19:40.467
Gee, they're tough!

19:42.033 --> 19:43.467
All right!
All right!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.434
You get everything?

19:46.469 --> 19:47.934
I think so.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.434
You take the towels?

19:49.469 --> 19:50.601
Of course.

19:50.636 --> 19:52.033
Hotel pads and pens?

19:52.068 --> 19:53.534
Yeah. And the soap.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.033
Good. And the ashtrays?

19:55.068 --> 19:56.968
Yeah. I think
we got everything.

19:57.003 --> 19:58.801
Before you close
the suitcase,

19:58.836 --> 20:00.234
you wanna grab
theYellow Pages.

20:00.269 --> 20:01.801
Al, it's Wisconsin.

20:01.836 --> 20:04.434
Hey, you roll them up,
they make a great log.

20:05.767 --> 20:08.767
Ah, gee. We had
a great time, honey.

20:08.802 --> 20:10.100
Yeah.

20:10.135 --> 20:13.100
You know, this is the first time
we've been in a motel room

20:13.135 --> 20:14.601
since our honeymoon.

20:14.636 --> 20:16.968
Yeah. We still have
those towels.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
Sixteen years
and you haven't changed a bit.

20:20.335 --> 20:22.234
You know, you look
exactly the same

20:22.269 --> 20:24.868
as you did the day
we were married.

20:24.903 --> 20:26.334
Yeah, I know.

20:27.734 --> 20:30.601
Aren't you gonna say
the same about me?

20:30.636 --> 20:31.868
Well, honey, I bowl.

20:31.903 --> 20:33.100
You don't do anything.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.567
Oh.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.067
Oh, hey, Peg,
you look great.

20:37.102 --> 20:40.000
Much too good for
an old guy like me.

20:40.035 --> 20:42.000
Oh, old guy?
Come on, Al.

20:42.035 --> 20:43.501
You're in great shape.

20:43.536 --> 20:46.501
I bet you could have handled
either one of those bums

20:46.536 --> 20:48.234
that fought today.

20:48.269 --> 20:49.667
You know what,
I think you're right.

20:49.702 --> 20:50.734
Yeah.

20:50.769 --> 20:52.701
You know, I got
a pretty good left jab...

20:52.736 --> 20:53.901
for a shoe salesman.

20:53.936 --> 20:56.100
I tell you what I would have
done with that Gonzales.

20:56.135 --> 20:57.701
I'd have waited
till he dropped his hands.

20:57.736 --> 21:00.100
He always does that
when he doubles up with a hook.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.200
Then I'd have
stepped inside,

21:01.235 --> 21:02.701
hooked to the head,

21:02.736 --> 21:04.200
uppercut, uppercut,
uppercut.

21:04.235 --> 21:05.701
If that don't work,

21:05.736 --> 21:07.701
I'd take the legs out!

21:10.035 --> 21:11.634
Aah, ha, ha.

21:11.669 --> 21:14.100
Aaah.

21:14.135 --> 21:15.133
Mmm.

21:16.601 --> 21:19.601
Maybe we should call
Steve and Marcie

21:19.636 --> 21:20.734
and tell them

21:20.769 --> 21:22.467
we're not coming home
tonight.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.868
Why bother? They said
it's no trouble.

21:29.634 --> 21:31.968
Oh, Al.

21:32.003 --> 21:36.667
<i>* And the rockets'
Red glare **</i>

21:38.801 --> 21:41.734
* Things keep happenin'
I can't explain *

21:41.769 --> 21:46.434
* I love to sweat
And suck on the stain *

21:48.100 --> 21:52.234
* Well, I went to bed drunk
With a girl named Flo *

21:52.269 --> 21:56.067
* I woke up sober
With a buffalo *

22:00.501 --> 22:03.133
* I'm a fugitive
I only live *

22:03.168 --> 22:06.267
* To pummel *

22:06.302 --> 22:07.767
This will show them.

22:07.802 --> 22:09.267
Any minute now,

22:09.302 --> 22:11.767
they'll be pulling
into their driveway.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.801
You know, dear, they really
are wrecking our home.

22:18.836 --> 22:22.801
I know, but Peggy and Al
will be home any minute.

22:22.836 --> 22:25.801
I can't wait
to see their faces.

22:25.836 --> 22:28.400
Yep. Any minute.

22:30.567 --> 22:33.801
* I'm a fugitive
I only live *

22:33.836 --> 22:39.634
* To pummel *

22:39.669 --> 22:42.567
* I'm a fugitive
I only live *

22:42.602 --> 22:46.000
* To pummel **
