00:05.273 --> 00:08.274
- Well, that was all right, huh?
- Yeah.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.875
Well...

00:09.943 --> 00:12.012
- good night.
- Yeah, good night.

00:49.951 --> 00:52.110
Jerry, we can only stay four days.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.221
Well, I'm upset,
but we'll make the most of it.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.254
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

00:57.325 --> 01:00.724
Yes. Oh, your father bought
an exercise device off television.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.294
He does it every morning at 4.

01:02.363 --> 01:06.160
Only 25 minutes a day, and you can
attach it to any doorknob.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.761
So I guess your travel miles
are about to expire?

01:09.837 --> 01:13.634
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted
to talk to you about something.

01:13.708 --> 01:16.402
Am I finally getting a baby brother?

01:16.711 --> 01:18.142
Jerry, be serious.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.473
How would you feel
if we sold the Cadillac?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.843
What? The Cadillac
I bought for you?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.382
It's too much car, Jerry.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.919
Oh, come on. You love that car.
What about the Northstar system?

01:27.989 --> 01:30.148
I don't think we even use it.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.925
Well, it's a gift,
and I want you to keep it.

01:32.994 --> 01:34.493
We already sold it.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.156
Why didn't you tell me
before you sold it?

01:37.231 --> 01:40.027
We had a buyer, and we couldn't
get a free flight until now.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.828
We could but we wanted
the bulkhead.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.629
Oh, my God.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.302
Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.103
- Kramer....
- No, no, no, it's not the sex, Jerry.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.505
Hey, Seinfelds.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.340
- Hi, Kramer.
- Hi, Kramer.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.039
- We're in the middle of a discussion.
- Yeah? What about?

01:56.117 --> 01:58.185
Jerry's upset.
We sold the Cadillac.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.116
- What did you get for it?
- Jack Klompus gave us 6 grand.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.620
You sold my Cadillac
to Jack Klompus?

02:03.691 --> 02:05.122
We want you to have the money.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.419
- I don't need money.
- What are you talking about?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.187
You had a check bounce
at the bodega.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.730
Is that what this is all about? I bounce
a check and you sold a Cadillac?

02:12.800 --> 02:16.392
Well, also, Jerry, we read
an article in the Sun-Sentinel.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.266
It says that standup comedy
is not what it used to be...

02:19.340 --> 02:21.237
what with Def Jam and all.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.035
Yeah, that Def Jam is a force.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.377
Jerry, you know,
I hear wonderful things...

02:26.447 --> 02:28.845
about Bloomingdale's
executive training program.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.540
Oh, my God.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.050
You've given this comedy thing
your best shot.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.121
Yeah, you had some
good observations, but it's over.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.155
Now, this Bloomingdale thing:

02:38.225 --> 02:40.020
That could be the next wave.

02:44.999 --> 02:49.035
Excuse me. A pound
of Arabian Mocha Java, please.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.338
So you understand how my Peterman
stock options are gonna work?

02:52.406 --> 02:54.235
I'm going to the bathroom.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.876
It's just very interesting.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.672
Yeah, when it's your money
it's fascinating.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.781
Arabian Mocha Java.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.573
Oh, I got it.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.543
That Arabian is strong coffee.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.282
It's PLO blend.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.788
Oh, I got your coffee.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.419
- Oh, here, let me...
- No, it's on me.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.690
Oh, man. Okay, listen, guys,
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you, okay?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.834
- Yeah.
- Bye.

03:23.838 --> 03:25.769
- You see what just happened here?
- What?

03:26.307 --> 03:29.069
She treated me
to the Arabian Mocha Java.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.473
And you misinterpret this how?

03:31.846 --> 03:34.073
She's sticking it to me that
she makes more money.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.479
I'm sure she was just being nice
buying you the coffee.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.879
Not nice. Sticking it to me.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.577
- You're crazy.
- Sticking it to me.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.745
- George.
- Sticking it!

03:45.126 --> 03:47.285
So you're buying the car
back for your parents?

03:47.361 --> 03:50.953
- I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
- Your parents will never let you do it.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.658
They lie to me about selling the car,
I'll lie to them about buying it back.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.100
They think they can dump
6 grand on me? Think again.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.672
What kind of money
you think your parents have?

04:01.742 --> 04:04.333
- Excuse me?
- Bet they have more money than mine.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.176
- Come on. Your parents have money.
- You think?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.612
- When do they ever spend money?
- Never.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.410
- What are their expenses?
- Nothing.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.485
- Where do they go on vacation?
- Nowhere.

04:14.889 --> 04:17.753
- How much do you think they have?
- Few hundred grand?

04:17.825 --> 04:21.986
You're saying I stand to inherit
$300,000? Is that what you're saying?

04:22.062 --> 04:25.154
- You may not see it for 20 years.
- Twenty years? That long?

04:25.232 --> 04:27.197
Your father eat
bacon and eggs every day?

04:27.268 --> 04:29.097
Unfortunately, yes.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.832
How's your family history?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.503
- I have an aunt that died at 7.
- Really?

04:33.908 --> 04:35.737
Aunt Baby.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.671
- Elaine, you got a moment?
- Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.312
I need to speak to you
about some lady problems.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.350
Okay.

04:46.587 --> 04:50.851
You know, after I have sex with Emily,
I don't want her in the bed anymore.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.790
Yeah, because she's
throwing off my whole sleep.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.829
- She's got the Jimmy legs.
- Jimmy legs?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.463
Jimmy leg.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.902
So.... Well, maybe I should
just be honest with her, huh?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.404
Tell her after sex
you just want her out of there?

05:07.474 --> 05:10.168
Well, I'd say it nicely.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.239
I don't think so.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.877
Well, you know,
I really like this girl.

05:14.949 --> 05:17.017
I think if I could
work out this one thing...

05:17.084 --> 05:19.448
Yeah, I gotta be
honest with you, Kramer.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.056
You might be more than
just a couple of tweaks away...

05:23.123 --> 05:25.521
from a healthy relationship.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.753
Well, you're not exactly
zeroing in yourself, lady.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.586
All right, get out.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.494
Get out!

05:35.436 --> 05:38.903
So listen, I've gotta go down to
Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.

05:38.973 --> 05:40.540
You just heard about this today?

05:40.608 --> 05:43.438
They had a cancellation,
and they instantly called me.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.942
- Who cancelled?
- Carrot Top.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.512
I told you: My career is fine.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.911
I've been thinking about the family.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.853
Tell me about Aunt Baby.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.057
She's deceased.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.783
Yeah.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.760
Why did she die so young?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.359
She had problems.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.625
Internal.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.701
Is that common in our family?

06:09.770 --> 06:13.101
Well, your Uncle Moe,
he died a young man.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.264
Also internal problems.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.342
It's that temper on your side.

06:17.411 --> 06:21.971
They're yelling and yelling and then
one day, they're all gone.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.413
What about your side?
Your cousin Henny.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.883
She was sickly
from the moment I met her.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.988
Don't you talk about Henny!

06:29.657 --> 06:31.418
So I guess you two
are the lucky ones.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.387
So far.

06:33.460 --> 06:39.192
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today,
how old would she be?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.298
She'd never make it.

06:45.306 --> 06:47.874
So let me get this straight.
You enjoy the lovemaking...

06:49.209 --> 06:53.109
- Well, do you?
- Oh, yeah. Like strawberry pie.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.644
Okay. But you have a problem
sharing a bed with me.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.785
I know it's not what the ladies like...

06:58.852 --> 07:01.944
but without some solid sack time,
I'm a zombie.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.989
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, man.

07:05.059 --> 07:06.990
Meet me halfway.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.228
- You're not easy, Kramer.
- I know.

07:15.202 --> 07:20.296
So to what do I owe the pleasure
of this unannounced visit?

07:20.374 --> 07:22.135
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.368
You wanna buy it back? Why?

07:24.445 --> 07:27.275
You got drugs hidden in the trunk?

07:28.382 --> 07:31.849
- I'm kidding.
- All right. I'll give you 9000 for it.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.817
Nine thousand for a Cadillac?
It's got no miles on it.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.650
- You bought it for six.
- You're not me.

07:39.159 --> 07:44.390
- How much do you want for it?
- The Kelley Blue Book value: $22,000.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.896
Fourteen thousand.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.661
Done. But I get
to drive it tomorrow...

07:49.737 --> 07:51.805
because Doris
wants to go to Naples.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.599
You need a pen?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.633
Still works.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.909
Hey, where's Jerry?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.016
He's performing at Bally's
in Atlantic City.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.311
Oh, okay.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.416
Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.888
He always hides it from me.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.829
Yeah, Bally's?
Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.328
You know that number?

08:18.399 --> 08:20.490
I used to have a problem.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.360
What do you mean,
he's not registered?

08:24.405 --> 08:27.702
- Well, S-E-I-N-V...
- F. F-E-L-D.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.968
F-E-L-D.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.842
Well, I think you're wrong.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.017
All right, you have a lucky day too.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.414
- He's not there?
- No, they never heard of him.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.624
This is so nice of you to take us
all out to dinner, George.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.628
Well, as much as I enjoy
all the good-natured ribbing...

08:51.698 --> 08:53.459
nothing really
makes me happier...

08:53.534 --> 08:56.068
than spending money
on the people I care about.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.771
- Where's Jerry?
- Oh, he'll be here.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.533
By the way, Elaine, thank you...

09:01.608 --> 09:04.802
for laying out
for the Arabian Mocha Java.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.004
George, you didn't have to do this.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.242
I'm president of a big company.
I can afford to buy you coffee.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.080
- President?
- Yeah.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.949
- Hey, look, he's back. Hey.
- Hey.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.115
I got your message so I came
straight from Atlantic City.

09:19.193 --> 09:21.386
Kramer called Bally's.
You weren't registered.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.323
Well, I can't stay
under my own name.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.399
I was registered
under "Slappy White."

09:30.370 --> 09:32.062
Mom. Dad.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.936
Well, look who's here.
Hello, Seinfelds.

09:37.678 --> 09:41.612
- What are you doing here?
- We're having an upscale dinner.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.682
- What?
- Well, after talking to you...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.648
we realized we may not
have much time left.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.651
So we're blowing it all.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.890
Look, George, it's a Pierre Cardin.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.661
- That was all right.
- Yeah.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.873
Well, I'll see you.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.080
- Hello.
- Jerry.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.876
I had a little mishap with the car.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.655
I'm down here in Alligator Alley.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.059
- You better get down here.
- All right.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.054
Who was that?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.390
That was the Golden Nugget...

11:04.464 --> 11:06.361
also in Atlantic City.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.967
They heard such good things
about my show at Bally's...

11:09.036 --> 11:10.728
they want me for tonight.

11:12.239 --> 11:16.901
So I'll have to repack and go.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.277
That didn't sound
like the Golden Nugget.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.248
I'm worried. What happens
if we have to support Jerry?

11:25.652 --> 11:28.721
- I'll have to go back to work.
- Where would you work?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.248
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.

11:37.764 --> 11:42.961
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, I'm not sure
I understand why you want a job here.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.364
What's not to understand?

11:44.438 --> 11:46.665
Well, for one thing,
you live in Florida.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.601
I'm very comfortable
working out of the house.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.540
I have a phone.
We have a Kinko's nearby.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.743
You know, I think
that my résumé speaks for itself.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.943
- Where is your résumé?
- I don't have it. I'll mail you one.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.314
All right, Mr. Seinfeld...

12:02.389 --> 12:04.923
what kind of a position
did you have in mind?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.753
- You sell clothes, don't you?
- Yeah.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.988
Well, I sold raincoats
in the garment center for 38 years.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.655
- In 1949...
- All right. All right. All right.

12:13.734 --> 12:17.099
You come in tomorrow.
We'll find something for you to do.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.101
You won't regret this, Ms. Benes.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.001
What time should I be in?
I get up at 4.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.971
I could be here as early as 4:25.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.505
Oh, Elaine...

12:26.580 --> 12:30.548
this dry air is curing me
like a Black Forest ham.

12:30.984 --> 12:34.850
Mr. Peterman? You're back.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.785
Who's Mr. Fancy?

12:43.697 --> 12:46.163
I was thinking maybe
I should spend the night.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.564
Oh, that's sweet, but actually, I....

12:49.803 --> 12:52.133
I think I'd prefer it if you left.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.930
- What?
- You were completely right.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.303
I sleep so much better
when I'm alone.

12:58.512 --> 13:01.979
- And you scream in your sleep.
- I do?

13:05.185 --> 13:08.777
There was a man. He was trying
to get into my apartment last night.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.455
He was jiggling the doorknob
for 25 minutes.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.160
- Come on. It was probably the wind.
- No, no.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.193
No, it was a fearless cat burglar.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.423
Now, listen, you gotta
let me sleep here.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.831
I'll stay over here on my side,
and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.631
Because I don't wanna sleep alone.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.298
Well, I do.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.946
What took you so long?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.381
I live in New York.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.552
What the hell happened?

13:41.621 --> 13:44.212
This thing is a behemoth.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.858
What did you do?

13:45.926 --> 13:49.154
I was making a simple lane change.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.423
I put on the blinker,
and it took off on me.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.692
And the next thing you know,
I was submerged.

13:54.768 --> 13:59.066
I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky
that those crocs didn't get me.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.073
You are such an idiot.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.874
Well, we got to get the car
cleaned up for my parents.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.214
Do whatever you want. It's your car.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.583
My car? You drove it
into the swamp.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.749
It drove itself into the swamp.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.886
Besides, I think I lost my pen too.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.863
You know, that almost
makes this all worthwhile.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.472
Why is there a Cadillac parked
in front of the house?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.569
That's your mother's new car.

14:37.778 --> 14:39.106
You bought that?

14:39.179 --> 14:41.144
It's a coupe de elegance.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.175
Your father wanted a Mercedes...

14:44.251 --> 14:47.218
but I won't ride in a German car.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.456
Morning.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.654
Oh, boy.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.619
What the hell is going on here?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.787
I had some trouble at my place.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.593
So I need a little company
at night to sleep.

15:02.536 --> 15:07.403
George, your mother and I
and Kramer have been talking.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.701
- Oh, God.
- George...

15:09.776 --> 15:12.538
your parents can't blow
their savings in this community.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.273
It's low-rent. We feel that Florida is
really the place where they should be.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.577
You can drop a grand
in Disney World like that.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.619
Wait a minute. You're moving
to Florida again?

15:22.689 --> 15:26.452
Well, it's either that
or we stay here near you...

15:26.526 --> 15:28.890
and just sit on the money.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.656
What do you think
we should do, Georgie?

15:36.369 --> 15:40.132
So effective immediately, Ms. Benes
will return to her old position...

15:40.207 --> 15:44.676
at her original salary and I,
of course, will return to mine.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.005
Kudos, Elaine, on a job...

15:47.080 --> 15:48.169
done.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.149
What about my stock options?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.218
I think not.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.154
Now down to business.
I have had this vision...

15:57.224 --> 15:59.815
of a diaphanous rumrunner scarf.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.860
Well, we could fly some fabric in
from our silk factories...

16:02.929 --> 16:06.157
- for about $1000 dollars a bolt.
- A thousand?

16:06.233 --> 16:08.563
I know a couple of Chinamen
over on 43rd Street...

16:08.635 --> 16:12.000
- that will do it for half that.
- It's, Asian Americans.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.730
What?

16:13.807 --> 16:16.501
Who are you?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.166
- Don't worry...
- Morty Seinfeld.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.473
I cut velvet for 40 years
with Harry Alper.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.275
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, this is not...

16:23.350 --> 16:25.680
Elaine, did you hire this man?

16:25.752 --> 16:31.188
No, no... Well, I mean, he's more
like an intern, you know, at best.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.727
So if your parents move to Florida,
you're poor.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.295
- But happy.
- Obviously.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.992
And if they stay, you're rich, but....

16:42.235 --> 16:44.132
Obviously.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.765
It's quite a dilemma.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.669
You know, I have
a bit of a dilemma of my own.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.070
No, no, no.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.871
We're staying on me.
We haven't solved anything yet.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.879
All right. This is easy.
Just let them go. So now, listen...

16:55.949 --> 16:58.244
What do you mean?
They're spending all my money.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.648
All right. Then they stay.
Let me ask you a ques...

17:00.720 --> 17:02.845
Could you put
a little thought into this?

17:02.923 --> 17:06.049
Jerry's gone. You could humor me.
He humors me.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.625
Speaking of Jerry...

17:07.694 --> 17:11.890
his father is driving me
so crazy down at Peterman's.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.727
Know what I do when one of these
guys is breathing down my neck?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.800
- What?
- You schedule a late meeting.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.396
- What does that do?
- Old guys are up at 4 a.m.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.097
By 2:30, they're wiped...
How did we get back on to you?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.571
I gotta go.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.509
You know I got nothing out of this.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.282
- Hey, Frank.
- Yeah.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.680
You got two beds in here.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.447
That's right. That's me on the left.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.318
So you sleep in separate beds.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.288
Thirty years ago
we came to an agreement.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.984
The only way
I could get some rest.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.652
Really?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.889
Estelle has got the jimmy arms.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.924
You can get that in your arms?

17:48.001 --> 17:50.262
Like you wouldn't believe.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.040
Jerry, it's getting late.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.874
You cleaned up the car.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.477
You made all your phone calls.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.238
Why are you still here?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.578
Well, I maxed out my credit cards.

18:05.652 --> 18:09.210
And I don't have enough cash
for a hotel room.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.256
- So....
- You are thinking of staying here?

18:12.325 --> 18:15.758
- Well....
- You've got some nerve.

18:15.829 --> 18:19.421
I almost break my neck
in that deathtrap of yours...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.658
and now you ask me for a favor?

18:21.735 --> 18:23.427
Didn't like that crack
about the pen?

18:23.503 --> 18:25.332
I did not.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.467
Well, I've given this
a lot of thought...

18:30.543 --> 18:32.235
and I've gotta say...

18:34.214 --> 18:36.976
As much as I'd like to see
the two of you living it up...

18:37.050 --> 18:39.948
in a warm, tropical setting...

18:40.020 --> 18:41.849
I would just miss you too much.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.512
So I've decided...

18:44.591 --> 18:47.683
I want you to stay.

18:48.028 --> 18:49.459
It's too late.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.563
We bought a condo
at Del Boca Vista.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.562
We're leaving tonight.

18:55.402 --> 18:56.969
You said it was my call.

18:57.037 --> 18:59.264
We were just being nice.

19:00.607 --> 19:04.803
Cosmo, are you sure you're
gonna be all right here alone?

19:04.878 --> 19:07.173
Oh, yeah, I got Emily
coming over tonight.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.008
You're letting him
have a woman over?

19:09.082 --> 19:11.548
He's not family.
It's different psychologically.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.681
And so I made an explosive
out of chickpeas.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.362
And I stopped that great rhino
right in his tracks.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.828
- It's getting late. Why don't we...
- Mr. Peterman...

19:25.899 --> 19:30.026
that can't have been the only time
that you faced mortal danger.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.236
Funny you should ask, Elaine.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.600
If we're gonna stay
till all hours of the night...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.639
can't we at least
get some food here?

19:37.110 --> 19:39.007
It's only 5:15.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.339
So later on that same day...

19:42.415 --> 19:45.450
I developed a great hankering
for some wild honey.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.846
Okay, I'm done.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.547
I'll be back in the morning when
he's close to finished with this story.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.384
Morty.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.084
My stories
are what sell these clothes.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.593
Cheap fabric and dim lighting:

19:57.664 --> 19:59.857
That's how you move merchandise.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.533
Okay.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.725
You're out.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.767
I never knew what I was
peddling with those stupid cartoons...

20:06.840 --> 20:09.135
and that paper book anyway.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.129
I don't know why I let you talk me
into that corned beef at Snitzers.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.929
- No one held a gun to your head.
- Yeah.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.436
Don't forget: We're eating
at the Fidermans' tomorrow.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.598
Why do I have to go?
They're your friends.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.868
- You like them.
- I've had it with them.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.943
Then we won't go.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.640
Okay, okay. What time?

20:50.984 --> 20:52.813
Eight-thirty.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.055
That was all right.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.928
"One bright note in today's market
was the stock of retailer J. Peterman...

21:13.006 --> 21:16.269
whose founder's surprise return
generated a rise...

21:16.342 --> 21:19.434
of 12 and a half points."

21:21.147 --> 21:23.511
That means if you still had
those stock options....

21:23.583 --> 21:24.911
Yeah.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.414
That's a shame.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.478
What are you, sticking it to me?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.454
- What?
- I think you're sticking it to me.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.490
I'm sure George
is just being sympathetic.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.889
Sticking it!

21:37.830 --> 21:39.864
You're not alone.
I'm practically broke.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.591
- Really?
- No.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.133
But...

21:43.203 --> 21:45.794
I did blow over 20,000
on that Cadillac.

21:47.207 --> 21:48.535
Delicious.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.303
- You seem happy.
- Hey, the folks are 1200 miles away.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.412
I'm basking in the buffer zone.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.343
Another piece of pie here.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.181
So were your parents shocked
to see the Cadillac?

21:59.252 --> 22:01.684
Actually, I haven't heard
from them yet.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.446
When are we gonna tell Jerry?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.090
I don't wanna worry him.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.783
We'll tell him next time we go up.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.890
He thought he could buy back
that Cadillac for us?

22:10.964 --> 22:13.123
He's not getting away with that.

22:13.499 --> 22:17.194
Besides, that condo
was too much house.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.607
How many times
can you check the car?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.040
I saw a bum sleeping
in the Cadillac the other day.

22:26.112 --> 22:30.012
Why would someone
break into a car to take a nap?

22:30.083 --> 22:32.117
They don't nap.
They make it their home.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.912
They urinate in there.

22:33.987 --> 22:35.850
You're driving me crazy.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.582
That's it. We're going back
to Queens. Where's my hat?

22:38.658 --> 22:40.817
No!
