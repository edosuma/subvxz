00:49.290 --> 00:53.002
That's a new Rolex, LT.
Do you think it suits me?

00:56.214 --> 00:58.591
You should have let me drive, LT.

00:58.591 --> 01:01.677
I'm supposed to be doing it for you.

01:02.887 --> 01:06.766
Are you stupid, Libiran?
When did I let anyone drive my car?

01:09.143 --> 01:11.813
Hey. Get that grin
off your face, Sales.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.882
I'll beat you up.
Didn't I outrank you?

01:15.525 --> 01:16.901
You're rude!

01:17.360 --> 01:20.321
Sorry, sarge.
I'm not grinning at you.

01:20.696 --> 01:23.032
I just find this guy cute.

01:23.057 --> 01:25.560
Check him out. He's so fresh.

01:25.993 --> 01:28.371
I thought you're a lesbian, Sales?

01:29.539 --> 01:31.124
Bicurious, LT.

01:31.149 --> 01:33.484
- What is that?
- Bicurious.

01:33.835 --> 01:36.671
I'm still trying things out, LT.

01:37.505 --> 01:40.633
Hey, Sales, don't touch him.

01:40.658 --> 01:42.743
We are near.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.472
Go fix yourself, kid.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.458
You asked for this.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.244
This is your chance.

01:51.269 --> 01:54.664
But if I hear any complaints,
I'm sending you back.

01:54.689 --> 01:56.732
You'll go straight to jail
and never get out.

01:56.732 --> 01:59.527
Better learn to suck cock.

01:59.527 --> 02:02.155
If it's just me,
you'd be in the can.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.157
You'll surely get your ass ripped,

02:04.157 --> 02:07.785
and your throat will be
filled with cum from murderers.

02:07.810 --> 02:11.063
But that doesn't
have to happen, right?

02:11.539 --> 02:14.876
I think you're a good kid.

02:14.901 --> 02:17.361
You won't let me down.
Am I right?

02:17.876 --> 02:19.088
Yes, sir.

02:19.464 --> 02:21.924
I think you're okay.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.052
You don't look like a criminal.

02:25.052 --> 02:26.804
You don't belong inside.

02:26.804 --> 02:29.640
Just shut your mouth
when I present you later.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.895
Yes, Lieutenant.

02:35.396 --> 02:36.898
I'll do my best.

02:38.733 --> 02:40.443
Thank you, Lieutenant.

04:50.406 --> 04:54.619
Lt. Agusto, my man!

04:55.181 --> 04:58.218
You, sir, are just
in time for the party.

04:58.539 --> 05:01.383
Happy Independence Day, Mr. Stonehill!

05:01.587 --> 05:02.932
Thanks, buddy.

05:03.794 --> 05:04.906
You know what?

05:05.379 --> 05:08.507
Excellent job taking care of our friend
down there at the port.

05:08.532 --> 05:10.554
May he rest in peace.

05:11.735 --> 05:13.904
You know that transaction
with the secretary?

05:14.027 --> 05:15.946
Well, hell, that could have gone south...

05:15.971 --> 05:17.306
had it not have been for you.

05:17.331 --> 05:18.367
It's a job.

05:18.491 --> 05:20.076
I serve at your pleasure, sir.

05:20.101 --> 05:21.492
Come on, man.

05:22.047 --> 05:23.340
What's with the formality?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.758
Do I look British to you?

05:25.008 --> 05:26.301
Stop calling me sir.

05:27.104 --> 05:29.689
You call me Sam from now on.

05:30.626 --> 05:31.734
By the way,

05:34.351 --> 05:38.313
Mr. Yee and Mr. Lopez over there
brought the contract,

05:39.231 --> 05:41.900
and I have got something for you.

05:42.943 --> 05:43.944
What do you say?

05:45.341 --> 05:48.344
By the way, Mr. Stone...
I mean, Sam,

05:49.027 --> 05:51.404
- I found you a new houseboy.
- Oh, man.

05:51.429 --> 05:52.514
This here's Jake,

05:53.537 --> 05:54.580
my maid's nephew.

05:54.663 --> 05:55.764
Hell, boy.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.125
You, sir, are a lifesaver, man.

05:58.976 --> 06:01.144
My housemaid, Jenny, and my wife, well,

06:01.169 --> 06:03.249
they couldn't manage this place
by themselves

06:03.397 --> 06:05.774
and that last boy you dropped off,
well, hell,

06:05.799 --> 06:07.593
he didn't cut it either.

06:07.714 --> 06:09.022
Poor bastard.

06:09.187 --> 06:10.318
Come here, boy.

06:11.755 --> 06:13.089
Let me take a look at you.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.689
You're looking mighty young.

06:16.575 --> 06:17.868
But I tell you what,

06:18.314 --> 06:19.566
you do things right,

06:20.292 --> 06:21.961
keep everything good and tight,

06:22.522 --> 06:24.232
keep your hands to yourself,

06:24.848 --> 06:26.308
and I'll take care of you.

06:27.107 --> 06:28.250
Understood?

06:29.131 --> 06:30.537
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

06:30.771 --> 06:32.176
Oh, yeah.

06:32.201 --> 06:33.475
Come here, darling.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.702
This here is my wife, Adelyn,

06:36.727 --> 06:39.666
who's been complaining about

06:39.691 --> 06:41.693
how they can't manage this place.

06:42.288 --> 06:43.490
Take that.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.869
It's for you.

06:46.209 --> 06:49.296
By the way, who's hungry?

06:51.464 --> 06:52.674
You all ready to party?

06:53.488 --> 06:56.033
Why don't you and your crew
go grab a bottle.

06:56.058 --> 06:57.059
Come on up.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.669
Let me finish up on the grill...

06:59.427 --> 07:01.888
and we can celebrate
the fourth of July.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.292
Oh, yeah, baby!

07:05.317 --> 07:08.111
Happy fourth of July!

07:08.136 --> 07:09.788
Yeah!

07:09.905 --> 07:11.573
Woo!

07:11.975 --> 07:13.150
Yeah!

07:14.259 --> 07:15.469
Woo!

07:15.494 --> 07:17.579
Happy fourth of July!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.475
Sweetmeat, yeah!

07:19.500 --> 07:21.269
Woo!

07:21.294 --> 07:23.477
Woo!

07:23.502 --> 07:25.712
Woo!

07:26.088 --> 07:27.297
Woo!

07:27.673 --> 07:28.924
Woo!

07:29.258 --> 07:30.303
Yeah!

07:34.388 --> 07:36.390
Yeah!

07:39.309 --> 07:41.655
Why are you running?

07:42.604 --> 07:45.725
I'm looking at you.
You know I'm looking at you.

07:57.147 --> 07:59.066
Son of a bitch!

08:04.655 --> 08:06.003
Damn slut!

08:06.878 --> 08:09.256
Why are you running away
from me, huh?

08:09.313 --> 08:11.616
What? I gross you out, huh?

08:11.641 --> 08:13.022
Oh, no, no, Sam!

08:13.568 --> 08:15.320
You don't want to be
with an old man?

08:15.345 --> 08:16.600
No, no, Sam.

08:16.822 --> 08:18.448
I thought we're just fooling around.

08:18.473 --> 08:19.647
I'm sorry, honey.

08:19.672 --> 08:20.811
I'm sorry.

08:25.741 --> 08:27.207
Come here. Come here. Don't cry.

08:27.232 --> 08:29.022
Don't cry, sweetie. Come here.

08:29.047 --> 08:30.116
Come here.

08:30.193 --> 08:33.363
I was just fooling around, baby.
I was just fooling around.

08:33.864 --> 08:35.365
Don't be scared, darling.

08:35.955 --> 08:37.540
You know, I love you.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.802
I was just playing around, huh?

08:42.677 --> 08:44.011
Just fooling... huh?

08:47.651 --> 08:49.465
Having some fun, huh?

08:49.676 --> 08:50.730
Huh?

08:59.536 --> 09:01.682
Sir, is everything okay?

09:01.707 --> 09:02.784
Son of a bitch.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.228
- God damn it.
- Ma'am, sorry!

09:05.253 --> 09:07.269
I heard a glass breaking.

09:07.332 --> 09:08.449
The hell?

09:08.713 --> 09:10.423
Everything's okay here, Jake.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.816
Oh, shit.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.545
Let's go to the bedroom.

09:13.570 --> 09:14.755
Oh, screw that.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.782
This is my goddamn house!

09:17.174 --> 09:20.719
I should have to adjust because that
son of a bitch just walks in my house

09:20.744 --> 09:23.955
and thinks he can just interrupt
some good shit?

09:24.247 --> 09:27.042
Sam, honey, you know what?

09:27.417 --> 09:30.337
I'm going to show you
a good time there.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.947
I'll do your favorite.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.132
Let's go.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.010
Only because you said so.

09:38.053 --> 09:39.971
I don't give a shit about that boy.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.406
And you boy!

09:41.431 --> 09:42.769
You see all this mess?

09:42.794 --> 09:44.058
Clean this shit up.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.852
- You hear me?
- Careful, please.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.097
You ruining my damn time.

09:48.122 --> 09:49.290
Stupid idiot.

09:49.314 --> 09:50.543
Son of a bitch.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.464
You really know how to ruin
a good night! Don't you, boy?

09:56.489 --> 09:57.907
Son of a bitch.

09:57.932 --> 09:59.566
You messed up my night.

10:02.739 --> 10:04.032
Asshole.

10:46.788 --> 10:48.123
Move here.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.546
Come here.

10:58.031 --> 11:00.033
Now what's you wanna do, huh?

11:01.613 --> 11:02.679
Oh.

11:03.993 --> 11:05.245
Oh, yeah.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.988
You told me I was gonna have my favorite.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.429
You said it, you whore.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.247
Now give it to me, huh?

11:34.502 --> 11:36.046
Oh, yeah.

11:39.770 --> 11:41.480
Oh, you like that, don't you?

11:41.505 --> 11:43.257
Yes, Sam.

11:43.282 --> 11:45.614
- I like it.
- Oh, you like it, don't you?

11:45.639 --> 11:47.027
- Yeah.
- You whore.

11:47.052 --> 11:50.324
- You whore.
- Oh, make me scream, please.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.222
Harder!

11:52.689 --> 11:53.815
Oh.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.105
It's okay.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.730
It's just like that in the beginning,
but you'll get used to it.

12:04.949 --> 12:06.826
Just do your job.

12:12.366 --> 12:16.542
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
You little whore.

12:17.316 --> 12:19.089
- Yes, Sam.
- You take it.

12:19.436 --> 12:20.760
- Oh.
- I like it.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.472
Make me scream.

12:38.452 --> 12:40.332
Is ma'am Adelyn okay?

12:40.357 --> 12:41.942
Don't mind her.

12:42.401 --> 12:46.691
Let's just clean this up
before Sam gets mad at us.

12:47.050 --> 12:51.720
If he wakes up and everything's messy,
he won't like it.

12:52.247 --> 12:53.790
He's ex-G.I.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.150
What G.I?

12:55.460 --> 12:57.545
Retired US military soldier.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.196
He's a pensioner
and has lots of money.

13:00.981 --> 13:05.402
Sam is generous, so if you stay
here long enough,

13:05.427 --> 13:07.137
you'll save money.

13:07.523 --> 13:10.150
Isn't that why you're here?

13:13.643 --> 13:14.644
But...

13:15.714 --> 13:16.847
Jake,

13:17.397 --> 13:20.066
never defy Sam.

13:21.745 --> 13:24.039
He's scary when he gets mad.

14:10.241 --> 14:11.618
- Jenny.
- Ma'am?

14:12.084 --> 14:14.205
Please clean our room.

14:14.334 --> 14:17.878
Change Sam's clothes as well, please.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.378
Yes, ma'am.

15:13.697 --> 15:15.991
Yeah, everything's set, Mr. Lopez.

15:25.709 --> 15:27.215
You know me, man.

15:27.711 --> 15:29.708
I take care of business.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.509
Well,

15:33.867 --> 15:35.869
this is a big payday
for you and me.

15:36.286 --> 15:38.121
So you tell Mr. Yee,

15:38.525 --> 15:41.945
it's a guarantee that his contract
will be signed.

15:44.705 --> 15:45.998
You got that right.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.047
Those greedy officials,

15:48.307 --> 15:49.559
they're on our side.

15:53.094 --> 15:54.262
As usual,

15:54.679 --> 15:56.222
I'll take care of the government...

15:56.931 --> 15:58.892
but you make sure
that the money is there

15:59.142 --> 16:00.310
for when we meet.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.993
Alright, Mr. Lopez.

16:05.315 --> 16:06.441
I'll see you later.

16:07.442 --> 16:08.902
Let's close this deal.

16:08.977 --> 16:10.111
What'd you say?

16:26.544 --> 16:27.754
Do me a favor.

16:28.282 --> 16:31.799
Call Agusto and tell him to come
pick me up in about two hours.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.171
Okay.

16:35.279 --> 16:37.198
Will you be home for dinner?

16:37.425 --> 16:38.426
Nah.

16:38.819 --> 16:39.820
Don't wait up.

16:41.196 --> 16:42.202
Okay.

17:23.762 --> 17:26.260
Pretty humid weather we're
having up there, ain't it, Jenny?

17:31.220 --> 17:32.383
It's hot.

18:47.935 --> 18:49.687
Honey, take care.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.523
Don't worry, sweetmeat.
I'll be all right.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.984
There's no need to worry.

18:55.589 --> 18:57.215
I got the team with me.

18:59.924 --> 19:01.115
Thank you.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.226
Lt. Agusto, please take care
of my husband.

19:04.661 --> 19:05.870
Yes, Mrs. Stonehill.

19:07.342 --> 19:08.760
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

19:57.317 --> 19:58.541
Go ahead, Jenny.

19:58.566 --> 20:00.693
I'm done.
Just clean this up, please.

20:00.718 --> 20:01.719
Okay, ma'am.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.352
Ah, and pour me some wine.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.462
Alright, ma'am.

20:10.629 --> 20:12.881
When you're done,
you can take a rest.

20:13.368 --> 20:15.078
Sam will be coming home late.

20:15.909 --> 20:17.452
Don't wait for him.

20:18.073 --> 20:19.366
Alright, ma'am.

21:46.679 --> 21:49.390
You look like you've seen a ghost?

21:49.553 --> 21:50.638
Sorry, ma'am.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.664
I didn't know that
you were there.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.057
I'm really sorry.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.501
I didn't say that you get out of the pool.

21:59.489 --> 22:01.449
I feel embarrassed, ma'am.

22:01.731 --> 22:03.191
I'm really sorry.

22:05.539 --> 22:08.542
This is where I hang out
when Sam is not here.

22:09.778 --> 22:11.822
Just pour me some wine.

22:22.087 --> 22:23.463
Thank you.

22:24.356 --> 22:26.361
Wait. Where are you going?

22:26.731 --> 22:29.526
Sit down for a while.
Keep me company.

22:50.553 --> 22:51.596
Thanks.

22:54.932 --> 22:56.517
You smoke?

22:58.519 --> 23:02.648
I tried it before, ma'am, but...

23:04.539 --> 23:06.916
I stopped because it's expensive.

23:08.015 --> 23:10.101
I didn't know you smoked, ma'am?

23:10.126 --> 23:11.586
Sometimes.

23:11.866 --> 23:14.160
Especially when Sam is not around.

23:15.675 --> 23:17.322
You didn't light it well.

23:24.086 --> 23:25.212
Sorry, ma'am.

23:29.422 --> 23:32.008
You're the nephew of Agusto's maid?

23:33.113 --> 23:34.490
Me, ma'am?

23:35.561 --> 23:36.728
Who else?

23:40.509 --> 23:42.431
I'm not supposed to tell, ma'am.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.467
But the truth is...

23:52.388 --> 23:54.860
Lieutenant took me under his wing.

23:56.126 --> 23:58.336
I'm from the province, ma'am.

23:59.058 --> 24:04.147
I tried my luck to
find work in the city...

24:06.287 --> 24:07.497
But...

24:07.601 --> 24:09.770
I was taken by the police.

24:10.766 --> 24:13.769
I just couldn't find a job and...

24:14.326 --> 24:16.400
had no place to stay either.

24:18.131 --> 24:21.367
He got me off the hook.

24:22.899 --> 24:25.526
Lieutenant has been good to me, ma'am.

24:26.695 --> 24:31.325
Ma'am, I hope you won't get mad.

24:31.865 --> 24:34.095
Please don't kick me out.

24:35.615 --> 24:38.564
I just don't want to lie to you.

24:41.721 --> 24:44.140
I'm also from the province.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.085
What province where you from?

24:48.410 --> 24:50.245
San Isidro, ma'am.

24:50.685 --> 24:52.812
I was born there.

24:55.136 --> 24:56.554
It's quite far.

24:58.139 --> 25:02.560
Well, actually, it's just next
to my hometown.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.003
I'm from San Bartolome.

25:07.601 --> 25:09.948
We're almost from the same town, ma'am.

25:12.528 --> 25:14.155
Small world, right?

25:14.499 --> 25:15.584
Yes.

25:16.138 --> 25:17.306
But...

25:21.086 --> 25:23.047
there's no future there.

25:24.182 --> 25:26.977
Life was hard and slow.

25:30.895 --> 25:33.800
That's why I get you.

25:40.420 --> 25:42.253
That's where Sam found me.

25:42.825 --> 25:44.479
That's where we met.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.604
He had a project there.

25:47.550 --> 25:50.745
He paid for my father's medical bills...

25:51.604 --> 25:53.522
but my father didn't make it.

25:54.075 --> 25:55.535
He didn't recover.

26:02.078 --> 26:03.871
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:08.751 --> 26:09.919
Thank you.

26:11.045 --> 26:13.214
But that was a long time ago.

26:20.763 --> 26:21.972
By the way,

26:23.099 --> 26:24.433
just call me Adelyn.

26:24.725 --> 26:27.937
Don't be too formal.

26:28.604 --> 26:33.234
When it's just the two of us,
call me Adelyn.

26:33.943 --> 26:38.114
Don't worry, I won't tell my husband.

26:46.288 --> 26:50.342
And what you told me...
that'll be our secret.

26:52.899 --> 26:55.509
I don't want this anymore.
Take it.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.283
Don't waste it.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.156
As you've said, cigarettes are expensive.

27:14.006 --> 27:15.132
Sorry, ma'am.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.775
Finish this, too.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.285
Just return the wine glass
when you're done.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.375
Yes, ma'am.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.343
Oh, hey, did I wake you sweetmeat?

28:23.792 --> 28:28.004
No, I was just laying down
and waiting for you.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.329
What do you want for breakfast?

28:31.354 --> 28:33.523
Oh, yeah, I'm too tired to eat,

28:33.737 --> 28:37.158
but just make sure you have
a hearty lunch later,

28:38.004 --> 28:40.882
and tell our houseboy
to ready my boat.

28:41.456 --> 28:43.374
I'm gonna go fishing
this afternoon, all right?

28:43.624 --> 28:46.228
- Okay.
- That's great, thank you.

29:21.902 --> 29:25.322
Why don't you hand me one of them
cold ones over there, Jake?

29:27.366 --> 29:30.619
The beer, boy, in the cooler.
Hand me a beer, man.

29:34.452 --> 29:35.556
Thanks.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.375
Ah.

29:40.354 --> 29:42.296
Tell me a little bit about yourself, Jake.

29:42.321 --> 29:44.406
What about your family?
How're they doing?

29:47.720 --> 29:50.806
My father and my mother are gone,
Mr. Stonehill.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.517
What do you mean by gone?

29:55.769 --> 29:57.855
I didn't get to see my father.

29:58.814 --> 30:03.360
He left us when I was born,
and my mother...

30:03.874 --> 30:05.668
she died a few months ago,

30:05.881 --> 30:07.299
pneumonia.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.117
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.186
That's gotta be a shitty situation.

30:12.703 --> 30:15.205
You got any siblings,
brothers, sisters?

30:15.544 --> 30:17.254
None, Mr. Stonehill.

30:17.333 --> 30:20.461
Well, hell, we all need something
to motivate us in life.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.849
And family, especially to you Filipinos,

30:24.363 --> 30:26.531
is life's great motivator.

30:27.666 --> 30:30.418
Well, hell, I guess we all got
something to live for.

30:30.566 --> 30:33.194
Some kind of credo
to pump us up in life.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.037
Like,

30:35.251 --> 30:39.005
how I know ain't nobody gonna give you
nothing for free in life, right?

30:39.261 --> 30:42.180
So that's why I just take what I want,
when I want it,

30:42.609 --> 30:43.902
just like kings do.

30:44.668 --> 30:47.379
Hell, that's why I'm here in Philippines
as it is, man.

30:47.404 --> 30:49.433
You got all these islands everywhere.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.084
They're just up for the taking.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.314
What about you?

30:54.570 --> 30:56.245
What's your plans in life?

30:59.168 --> 31:00.986
I don't know, Mr. Stonehill.

31:01.011 --> 31:02.220
I guess...

31:03.041 --> 31:04.543
save some money,

31:05.278 --> 31:07.029
maybe go back to school,

31:07.716 --> 31:12.596
and have my own family someday.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.290
You ever considered
joining the military?

31:16.490 --> 31:19.001
No, sir, but my father did.

31:19.593 --> 31:21.470
Well, I get it.

31:21.495 --> 31:24.873
I mean, you seem like a pretty bright kid,
you know?

31:25.398 --> 31:27.112
Got your head on your shoulders,

31:27.477 --> 31:29.822
shit, your English is damn good.

31:30.614 --> 31:35.035
It's my favorite subject, sir,
when I was in school.

31:35.750 --> 31:36.759
Oh.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.007
Tell you what,

31:39.807 --> 31:41.517
you do something for me,
I'll do something for you.

31:41.542 --> 31:42.626
How about that?

31:43.455 --> 31:46.041
You know, do good around here,
be a good boy,

31:46.228 --> 31:47.521
stay loyal,

31:47.846 --> 31:50.651
I just might pay for your education
when the time comes.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.228
What do you think about that?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.515
I don't know what to say.

31:57.461 --> 31:59.380
That's very kind of you, sir.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.165
Ain't that right?

32:01.562 --> 32:03.976
Yes, Mr. Stonehill, I'll be a good boy.

32:04.001 --> 32:06.170
All right, that's what I'm talking about.

32:06.248 --> 32:08.167
So why don't you do something right now?

32:08.441 --> 32:11.736
Why don't we just start by you
sucking my dick?

32:13.369 --> 32:14.408
Sir?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.101
Yeah, you heard me.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.669
Suck my cock.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.496
Make me cum.

32:20.038 --> 32:24.501
Swallow it down to the last drop
for your education.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.287
I was just messing with you, boy.

32:37.437 --> 32:39.044
You thought I was serious!

32:43.745 --> 32:45.664
Oh, shit, I think we got something, man.

32:45.689 --> 32:47.919
Why don't you grab that bucket
over there and help me up.

32:47.944 --> 32:49.696
Come on, get the bucket.

32:49.721 --> 32:50.972
The bucket.

32:52.112 --> 32:54.698
No, false alarm,
goddamn it.

33:02.143 --> 33:05.146
Yep, we got this business covered.

33:05.604 --> 33:06.638
That's right.

33:07.266 --> 33:10.812
Making deals, man, turning those wheels
and making deals.

33:10.837 --> 33:13.714
That's what we do, man, all about
the business.

33:14.443 --> 33:15.511
Yeah.

33:25.919 --> 33:27.247
All is good on this end.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.358
You just make sure, like I said,
you bring through,

33:29.383 --> 33:31.130
you come through with what you got.

33:31.740 --> 33:32.951
We got you covered.

33:33.113 --> 33:34.193
You know it.

33:36.318 --> 33:37.366
Uh-huh.

33:38.606 --> 33:39.677
Yep.

33:41.374 --> 33:42.443
Mm-hmm.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.740
Just make sure you come through
on your end.

33:47.765 --> 33:50.601
We got all this on our end.
We're good. We're good.

33:53.071 --> 33:54.322
I'm telling you.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.202
You know it.

33:58.507 --> 34:00.425
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

34:02.057 --> 34:03.058
Mm-hmm.

34:16.724 --> 34:17.823
Hi.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.770
Hey, sweetmeat.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.301
How's your day?

34:21.326 --> 34:24.179
It's great. It's nice weather out here.

34:24.204 --> 34:26.279
Oh, actually,
I bought you something.

34:26.304 --> 34:27.332
Oh!

34:27.332 --> 34:28.392
Look at it.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.654
What did you get me?

34:29.679 --> 34:31.802
- Let's see what you got.
- I'll do the massage.

34:33.374 --> 34:35.501
Oh, another shirt to go with my suit.

34:35.534 --> 34:36.599
I know.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.927
Jake?

36:31.067 --> 36:32.818
What are you doing here?

36:39.337 --> 36:42.715
I'm just showing you
what you bought for me.

36:44.219 --> 36:46.221
The size is just right.

36:50.767 --> 36:53.061
You know my size well.

36:59.151 --> 37:01.194
I also liked the cologne.

37:05.282 --> 37:07.659
I want you to smell it.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.580
My husband is just downstairs.

37:12.038 --> 37:13.248
We might get caught.

37:13.248 --> 37:14.583
I don't care!

37:16.251 --> 37:18.295
I've always wanted you, Adelyn.

38:13.183 --> 38:14.684
Stop it, Jake.

38:14.810 --> 38:16.645
It's ticklish.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.019
Your pussy tastes of blood,
sweetmeat!

39:39.044 --> 39:41.058
I'll eat you alive!

41:06.006 --> 41:07.216
I'm tired.

41:07.867 --> 41:09.744
I'm gonna go take a nap.

42:11.644 --> 42:12.672
Ma'am...

42:13.605 --> 42:14.838
Are you okay?

42:25.352 --> 42:26.478
Adelyn.

42:37.142 --> 42:39.582
Whatever you're feeling now,

42:41.646 --> 42:43.898
no matter how heavy it is,

42:45.705 --> 42:47.128
it will pass.

42:50.752 --> 42:53.254
There's no pain that doesn't go away...

42:54.362 --> 42:56.447
or wound that doesn't heal.

43:19.550 --> 43:20.865
Adelina?

43:31.827 --> 43:33.362
That's my mother's name.

43:34.994 --> 43:36.472
You have the same name.

43:38.267 --> 43:40.728
I always bring it with me so that,

43:41.120 --> 43:42.705
in a way,

43:44.037 --> 43:45.830
she's always with me.

43:50.687 --> 43:55.316
She used to wipe my tears with it
when I was a child,

43:57.152 --> 43:58.945
whenever I feel sad.

44:00.589 --> 44:03.342
And she always said the same thing,

44:06.400 --> 44:09.245
"There's no pain that doesn't go away.

44:11.875 --> 44:15.214
All our sufferings has an end."

44:18.221 --> 44:19.473
So...

44:23.584 --> 44:26.050
whatever you're feeling right now,

44:28.474 --> 44:31.310
just know that it will pass.

44:37.642 --> 44:39.603
Wipe your tears...

44:40.289 --> 44:41.909
and just smile.

45:00.381 --> 45:01.883
Thanks.

45:02.967 --> 45:04.964
Thanks, Jake.

45:06.429 --> 45:09.558
You know, even if you smoke,

45:09.583 --> 45:12.544
the cologne I gave you smells really nice.

45:22.403 --> 45:27.700
Here, boys, you can buy grade A
red meat for the price of chickens.

45:28.146 --> 45:29.564
If you know what I mean?

45:29.941 --> 45:34.612
Shit. Settle here,
get yourselves a Filipina wife,

45:34.637 --> 45:38.850
then you can buy some property,
and then you can do business.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.605
Hell, they love us here!

45:40.630 --> 45:44.698
You got that right, Sammy.
Some fresh juicy meat for a good bargain.

45:45.510 --> 45:49.097
Got me regret spending my pension
in Harlem for some shitty life.

45:49.472 --> 45:51.516
Gotta do some tricks there
just to survive.

45:51.854 --> 45:55.316
America treats you like shit and
sucks you dry for every penny.

45:55.348 --> 45:56.480
Ain't it, man?

45:56.528 --> 45:58.029
Shit.

45:58.406 --> 46:00.450
Well, well,

46:00.483 --> 46:02.026
I'll help you boys settle here.

46:02.670 --> 46:05.297
You know, we'll do
some business together,

46:05.344 --> 46:07.138
put some money in our pockets.

46:08.258 --> 46:10.635
Hell, you might as well just bring
your boys over here, too,

46:10.660 --> 46:12.941
so they can get in the old deals.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.083
And guess what?

46:14.854 --> 46:19.702
We can party all day and live
like goddamn kings!

46:21.039 --> 46:26.268
Sammy, you know, you give me
a hard on the way you describe that.

46:27.969 --> 46:30.596
Oh, I just wet myself, man.

46:30.963 --> 46:32.157
Come here, baby.

46:32.473 --> 46:33.566
Come here.

46:33.591 --> 46:34.948
I want you taste this.

46:35.734 --> 46:37.319
Make it wetter than what it was.

46:38.855 --> 46:40.128
Oh, yeah.

46:40.277 --> 46:41.377
Go slow.

46:41.956 --> 46:43.291
No need to rush it.

46:43.693 --> 46:45.361
We ain't going nowhere.

46:45.820 --> 46:48.448
It's paradise, Bobby.

46:48.878 --> 46:50.591
Hey, big boy, you making me horny.

46:50.616 --> 46:52.243
You show-boating asshole.

46:52.268 --> 46:53.425
You know it.

46:53.450 --> 46:55.027
Come here, girl.

46:55.139 --> 46:57.558
Give big daddy a kiss
while you're at it.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.167
Oh, boy.

47:01.083 --> 47:02.793
Speaking of kiss,

47:03.157 --> 47:06.703
why don't you give your
big old Sammy a kiss?

47:07.516 --> 47:08.851
Come here, sweetmeat.

47:10.069 --> 47:11.446
Sam, no, not here.

47:11.471 --> 47:12.550
Ah, come on.

47:12.613 --> 47:14.198
Not in front of your friends.

47:14.223 --> 47:15.933
- Come on.
- Stop it!

47:16.617 --> 47:18.619
What is your problem, Adelyn?

47:18.644 --> 47:20.753
Aren't you embarrassed
in front of your friends?

47:22.010 --> 47:25.054
- Hey, don't you turn your back on me!
- Let me go!

47:25.318 --> 47:27.153
Don't you turn your back on me!

47:32.033 --> 47:33.117
You know, boys,

47:33.493 --> 47:38.456
the trade-off of marrying a Filipina
is sometimes you get a crazy one.

47:43.336 --> 47:45.338
- Cheers.
- Cheers, I hear you, brother.

47:46.464 --> 47:47.550
Cheers.

47:47.714 --> 47:49.112
- Cheers, brother.
- Cheers.

47:49.137 --> 47:51.128
- Here you go, baby.
- Cheers.

48:19.909 --> 48:20.957
Jake.

48:21.499 --> 48:23.126
Sam wants to see you.

48:32.090 --> 48:34.176
You got eyes for my wife?

48:35.638 --> 48:38.724
You jerk off when you look
at her, huh, Jake?

48:40.765 --> 48:43.184
Don't you dare deny it to me, boy!

48:43.294 --> 48:46.255
I'll put a bullet through your cock,
if you try to lie to me!

48:46.357 --> 48:48.870
You wanna taste her, huh?

48:50.601 --> 48:53.937
I'll put a bullet through your cock,
if you try to lie to me!

48:54.866 --> 48:56.826
You want to do my wife.

48:57.827 --> 49:00.371
You want to taste her, huh?

49:04.714 --> 49:06.252
On your feet, boy.

49:06.794 --> 49:10.131
You stand right there, boy,
and you don't say a word!

49:11.070 --> 49:13.530
And you watch and don't even
blink your eyes.

49:13.555 --> 49:14.681
You understand?

49:19.546 --> 49:21.027
Pull this off!

49:29.783 --> 49:31.261
Get over here.

49:32.737 --> 49:34.370
I said get over here.

49:36.032 --> 49:37.105
Get...

49:37.530 --> 49:39.407
That's right, boy, you better watch.

49:39.432 --> 49:41.267
Watch like a dog!

49:42.095 --> 49:45.167
You watch, but you don't ever touch
what belongs to me.

49:47.572 --> 49:48.656
That's enough.

49:55.009 --> 49:56.552
This is what you want?

49:57.026 --> 50:01.322
You can't ever have this, because
you are a poor piece of shit.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.183
You ain't got enough guts...

50:04.305 --> 50:07.550
or enough money to
have this kind of ass!

51:08.285 --> 51:10.198
You like what you see, boy?

52:00.756 --> 52:01.979
We're ready to go?

52:03.269 --> 52:04.487
Alright.

52:06.223 --> 52:07.892
Lieutenant Agusto, it's on you.

52:07.917 --> 52:09.210
Yes, Mrs. Stonehill

52:42.635 --> 52:43.678
We good, sport?

52:45.327 --> 52:46.287
We're alright?

52:48.099 --> 52:49.141
You a good boy?

52:58.197 --> 52:59.236
Take it.

53:00.361 --> 53:01.987
That's a good boy.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.347
Let's roll.

56:23.676 --> 56:25.845
Is this your first?

58:39.548 --> 58:40.661
Let's roll.

01:02:35.394 --> 01:02:37.020
Did you like it?

01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:40.146
Really?

01:02:41.071 --> 01:02:43.607
Are you really going to ask me that?

01:02:49.173 --> 01:02:52.176
Everytime I hold you
and we become one.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.820
I always wish that
time would stop...

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:02.407
because...

01:03:03.106 --> 01:03:04.983
the feeling is too good.

01:03:06.152 --> 01:03:08.195
There's nothing like it.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.857
It's like all our misfortunes...

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:18.045
and the hardships I had,
all vanished when I met you.

01:03:33.084 --> 01:03:34.250
Why?

01:03:34.275 --> 01:03:36.318
Did I say something wrong?

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:46.459
Nothing.

01:03:49.009 --> 01:03:50.886
I'm just happy.

01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:56.475
It's just that I haven't experienced
or felt something like this before.

01:03:58.424 --> 01:03:59.425
Jake.

01:04:01.618 --> 01:04:03.871
I don't want this to end, too.

01:04:06.117 --> 01:04:08.869
Even though I know
that when Sam gets back,

01:04:08.894 --> 01:04:12.022
I would have to serve him again.

01:04:15.889 --> 01:04:18.892
He doesn't see me as a human being.

01:04:20.807 --> 01:04:23.810
I'm just one of his possessions.

01:04:25.587 --> 01:04:29.049
Sometimes he treats me like a toy,

01:04:29.902 --> 01:04:31.562
like an animal.

01:04:35.844 --> 01:04:39.844
Jake, I love you,
and I don't want to lose you.

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:48.355
I love you, too, Adelyn.

01:04:50.098 --> 01:04:52.726
I'll do anything for you.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:26.764
Why don't we just stop this?

01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:33.452
I don't want to put you
in danger, Jake.

01:05:34.903 --> 01:05:36.529
Just leave me.

01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:39.322
You're still young.

01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:41.914
You can still do many things.

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:47.033
I'll help you with money.

01:05:47.058 --> 01:05:50.686
I've saved some.
I can give it to you.

01:05:56.123 --> 01:06:00.419
You can still leave,
go somewhere far, and start over.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:05.437
Just ask permission from Sam,

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:11.002
if you haven't stolen anything and
owe him nothing, he'll let you go.

01:06:12.143 --> 01:06:13.908
He'll just replace you.

01:06:13.933 --> 01:06:15.033
Adelyn.

01:06:16.197 --> 01:06:19.408
You know I wouldn't do that to you, right?

01:06:20.903 --> 01:06:22.571
Adelyn, I love you.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.500
I'll do anything for you.

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.459
Come with me.

01:06:28.574 --> 01:06:30.118
Let's run away.

01:06:30.629 --> 01:06:33.173
Jake, we can't just do that.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:37.427
Sam will find us wherever we go,

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:39.796
and when he does,

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.886
he'll torture us,

01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:46.639
he'll treat us like dogs,

01:06:47.354 --> 01:06:48.772
like animals.

01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:54.306
He'll torture us until
we beg him to kill us.

01:06:54.819 --> 01:06:56.947
Sam is cruel like that.

01:06:58.865 --> 01:07:00.742
What can we do?

01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:04.628
Sam needs to be gone.

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:11.779
We need to get rid of Sam
so we can be free.

01:07:15.795 --> 01:07:17.338
What do you mean?

01:07:20.897 --> 01:07:23.775
Jake, look at me.

01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:28.155
You know what I mean.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:37.129
Jake, you need to be brave.

01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:41.324
You need to be fearless...

01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:44.502
for the both of us.

01:07:47.165 --> 01:07:49.674
We need to plan this carefully,

01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:52.177
and when Sam is gone,

01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:57.444
we can be together forever.

01:08:02.585 --> 01:08:04.462
Just like what I said...

01:08:07.809 --> 01:08:10.020
I'll do anything for you...

01:08:13.995 --> 01:08:17.290
but I'm not sure if I can...

01:08:20.071 --> 01:08:22.824
if I can kill.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.445
Jake.

01:08:37.088 --> 01:08:40.258
You won't be doing it alone.

01:08:42.177 --> 01:08:43.762
Look at me.

01:08:44.387 --> 01:08:47.098
I'm here by your side.

01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:50.352
I won't leave you.

01:08:51.603 --> 01:08:53.730
I won't leave you behind.

01:09:02.748 --> 01:09:05.538
Just trust me.

01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:10.009
Look at me.

01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:12.152
I love you.

01:09:18.129 --> 01:09:20.257
You love me, right?

01:10:12.662 --> 01:10:14.832
Ma'am! Ma'am!

01:10:14.857 --> 01:10:16.246
Ma'am, Sam is here!

01:10:16.271 --> 01:10:17.287
Shit!

01:10:18.567 --> 01:10:22.001
I think I left my pistol in the car
Tell your boy to get it.

01:10:22.026 --> 01:10:24.318
No, Mr. Stonehill,
it's in the bag.

01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:40.321
Ma'am, I'll take care of this, ma'am.

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:44.045
You need to go and greet
Sam downstairs. Go now!

01:10:58.188 --> 01:10:59.898
Where the hell is everybody?

01:11:01.107 --> 01:11:02.609
Hello.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.201
Where's Adelyn?

01:11:14.406 --> 01:11:16.289
Where the hell is my wife?

01:11:27.342 --> 01:11:28.635
Adelyn?

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:33.681
Adelyn?

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.142
Sweetmeat?

01:11:37.185 --> 01:11:38.561
I'm home!

01:11:39.437 --> 01:11:40.730
Adelyn?

01:11:41.523 --> 01:11:42.649
Sweetmeat?

01:11:43.107 --> 01:11:44.609
Where are you at?

01:11:48.613 --> 01:11:50.657
Oh, hey, Sam.

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:51.737
Hey.

01:11:52.355 --> 01:11:53.898
I'm home, sweetmeat.

01:11:53.993 --> 01:11:56.179
You're here, I know.

01:11:56.204 --> 01:11:58.142
I thought you'd be gone longer?

01:11:58.206 --> 01:12:01.167
Yeah, I thought I'd be gone
a few more days, too.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.353
But here I am.

01:12:03.378 --> 01:12:05.171
Why don't you come and join me?

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:08.449
Oh, now you're talking my language.

01:12:51.514 --> 01:12:52.807
Can I have some?

01:13:11.404 --> 01:13:12.488
Thank you.

01:13:13.998 --> 01:13:16.501
I should be the one
thanking you, Jenny.

01:13:17.368 --> 01:13:19.454
You don't need to thank me.

01:13:19.558 --> 01:13:22.227
I did it for ma'am Adelyn.

01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:30.297
You know, I've done so
many wrong things to her

01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:36.001
but she never spoke to me
or treated me badly.

01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:38.473
I don't know.

01:13:39.766 --> 01:13:42.060
Maybe she understands my situation.

01:13:44.395 --> 01:13:46.147
Maybe she understands...

01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:50.485
that I needed money for my child.

01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:56.074
I'm a single mother.

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:00.161
My child has no one else but me.

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:05.875
I just want to see her
finish her education,

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:10.713
give her a good life.

01:14:13.546 --> 01:14:15.464
The best one.

01:14:15.489 --> 01:14:17.867
That's what I want for my child.

01:14:21.474 --> 01:14:26.020
I don't want her to experience
what my family went through.

01:14:28.658 --> 01:14:31.450
I hope I'm the last
to have this kind of job.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:35.835
I'll do everything.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.407
I will give everything
for my child.

01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:48.641
I hope one day
she'll say to me,

01:14:52.092 --> 01:14:53.584
"Mama, thank you."

01:14:55.133 --> 01:14:57.927
"Thank you for all your sacrifices."

01:15:09.003 --> 01:15:10.880
"I love you very much."

01:15:15.429 --> 01:15:16.597
You know,

01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:21.854
perhaps,

01:15:22.923 --> 01:15:26.677
instead of just doing
what we want,

01:15:28.253 --> 01:15:31.593
we should be doing
what's needed to be done.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.420
I get you, Jenny,

01:15:36.843 --> 01:15:39.846
I also know that Adelyn is
a good person.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.983
I'll do anything to make her happy,

01:15:45.187 --> 01:15:46.772
and to set her free.

01:15:59.193 --> 01:16:02.381
I've known about you
and ma'am Adelyn, Jake.

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:07.447
Be careful.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:30.186
Man, that boy doesn't
know what hit him.

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:32.088
The way you served him up, Sammy?

01:16:32.396 --> 01:16:34.482
It's that Lopez
that sold him out.

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:38.236
I knew that greedy ass would
take the money and squeal.

01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:39.799
And that Yee?

01:16:40.177 --> 01:16:42.513
Yeah, he has head up
right up his ass,

01:16:43.108 --> 01:16:44.609
thinking he could take from me.

01:16:44.758 --> 01:16:46.176
Let me tell you, boys, something.

01:16:47.286 --> 01:16:49.304
This is my territory.

01:16:50.307 --> 01:16:52.522
Nobody messes with Sam Stonehill.

01:16:52.547 --> 01:16:53.684
Here,

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.419
I'm the goddamn king.

01:16:57.171 --> 01:16:59.549
Man, I bet that guy was a bleeder.

01:17:00.091 --> 01:17:04.702
The way he cried, wailed like a kid
when you cut his balls off.

01:17:05.429 --> 01:17:06.968
He didn't know what hit him.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:09.867
It's like Saddam in Iraq.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:12.353
- There you go... Yep.
- When we toasted his ass.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.505
Poor mustache wearing asshole.

01:17:16.524 --> 01:17:18.109
There you go, man.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:21.971
Besides tits and pussy, you got some
bad ass troops here, Sammy.

01:17:22.613 --> 01:17:25.324
We are protected.

01:17:26.259 --> 01:17:29.887
You know, I'm excited about getting my
friends here to do some business with us.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:32.999
You know what, cheers to that.
I'm glad to hear that, man.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:34.025
Let's do it.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.843
Let's close some deals, man.

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:37.311
Your guy.

01:17:37.336 --> 01:17:38.413
He's quiet.

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:39.839
Seems sad.

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:41.450
I think he needs some pussy.

01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:42.837
You know?

01:17:42.862 --> 01:17:43.874
Hey,

01:17:43.899 --> 01:17:45.526
that's what he needs!

01:17:46.472 --> 01:17:47.932
He needs some ass.

01:17:48.675 --> 01:17:50.969
Loosen him up. You know?

01:17:52.072 --> 01:17:53.156
Cheer him up.

01:17:55.054 --> 01:17:58.316
Bobby, since you're so concerned about

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.399
his dick needing some girl,

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.714
why don't you give him your girl? I mean,
you just got your dick sucked.

01:18:04.739 --> 01:18:06.616
I'm sure that's good
for the whole night.

01:18:11.662 --> 01:18:15.041
Why don't you give him yours?
While you're feeling so generous!

01:18:17.013 --> 01:18:19.015
And why don't you go fuck yourself
while you're at it!

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.288
There you go, oversensitive idiot.

01:18:22.548 --> 01:18:25.676
I'm just busting your balls,
joking around,

01:18:25.765 --> 01:18:28.434
man, and you take it like that.

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:29.627
That ain't right.

01:18:29.826 --> 01:18:32.328
You started it, redneck asshole!

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.853
This is my future wife
you're talking about.

01:18:36.505 --> 01:18:37.798
You know what?

01:18:38.408 --> 01:18:39.826
You're a piece of work.

01:18:42.443 --> 01:18:43.968
Let's get it on right now.

01:18:45.646 --> 01:18:46.952
What's with all the fighting?

01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:50.002
How are we supposed to get any kind
of business done,

01:18:50.027 --> 01:18:54.421
when you two are so goddamn
sensitive about your women?

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:57.350
You guys are better than that!

01:18:57.375 --> 01:18:58.793
Seriously, Sammy?

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.189
Out of all of us here,
you're the most possessive.

01:19:03.214 --> 01:19:05.633
And you know Bobby, come to think,
you ain't nothing.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:10.446
In fact, I bet you don't have balls to put
that gun down and fight me like a man.

01:19:10.471 --> 01:19:14.093
You know why? Becaise you know I would
beat you up, and that's for sure.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.467
Let's go, it's down.

01:19:19.743 --> 01:19:21.286
You shit talking asshole.

01:19:21.311 --> 01:19:23.030
All right! Enough! Enough!

01:19:24.438 --> 01:19:30.429
Why don't you two calm the hell down
and enjoy the show!

01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:32.010
Show?

01:19:32.999 --> 01:19:34.036
What show?

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.498
You got a show, you got a surprise
for us, Sammy?

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.062
You kinky bastard.

01:19:39.086 --> 01:19:43.382
Since both you two
are so clingy with your women,

01:19:44.018 --> 01:19:45.853
I'm gonna show you how it's done.

01:19:46.524 --> 01:19:48.023
You know what?
You're right.

01:19:48.048 --> 01:19:50.175
Our champ needs some pussy, right?

01:19:51.012 --> 01:19:53.931
I'll tell you what, I'm just gonna let him
have my wife for the night.

01:19:54.463 --> 01:19:59.092
Maybe, you know, these two Debbie Downers
over here can cheer each other up

01:19:59.117 --> 01:20:00.827
right in front of us.

01:20:01.776 --> 01:20:03.899
- Shit.
- That would be fun.

01:20:06.697 --> 01:20:08.407
Sorry, Sam,

01:20:08.796 --> 01:20:10.229
we're just all drunk here.

01:20:10.364 --> 01:20:11.532
I'm all good.

01:20:12.656 --> 01:20:13.782
Who's drunk?

01:20:14.616 --> 01:20:16.534
Are you saying I'm drunk?

01:20:17.225 --> 01:20:21.104
Feeling mighty high and righteous,
aren't we, Lieutenant?

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:22.541
You know?

01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:24.579
You don't forget...

01:20:25.449 --> 01:20:27.118
this is my house.

01:20:27.816 --> 01:20:31.190
And you don't get to tell me
what I can and can't do.

01:20:31.339 --> 01:20:32.339
You got it?

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:33.997
Calm down.

01:20:34.539 --> 01:20:36.354
What I meant to say was,

01:20:38.178 --> 01:20:39.292
I...

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:42.438
What the heck?

01:20:42.633 --> 01:20:44.010
Screw you!

01:20:47.615 --> 01:20:49.492
What are you gonna do?

01:20:53.483 --> 01:20:54.557
What?

01:20:58.037 --> 01:20:59.182
Oh!

01:21:01.415 --> 01:21:04.293
Party's over, boys.
Get out now!

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.105
The after party is about to begin.

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:12.176
You get that little shit out!
Get him out here! Now!

01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:17.190
What are you all sitting around for?
Get out! Everybody out!

01:21:18.158 --> 01:21:19.993
Pick this little shit up.

01:21:21.352 --> 01:21:22.353
Hold him up!

01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:26.440
You stupid boy.

01:21:26.665 --> 01:21:28.501
You've thrown away everything!

01:21:28.526 --> 01:21:30.820
You ungrateful piece of shit!

01:21:59.306 --> 01:22:02.101
You get this piece of shit
out of my face...

01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:04.770
and off my goddamn property!

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:08.149
And Agusto,

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:09.859
I want him dead!

01:22:10.234 --> 01:22:11.402
You hear me?

01:22:11.777 --> 01:22:14.780
You bury that little shit alive!

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:17.627
Stupid idiot.

01:22:18.075 --> 01:22:19.577
Yes, Mr. Stonehill.

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:21.328
Dumb piece of shit.

01:22:21.579 --> 01:22:22.955
Goddamn it.

01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:36.935
Lieutenant!

01:22:38.783 --> 01:22:40.143
Lieutenant!

01:22:42.349 --> 01:22:45.102
Lieutenant! Have mercy on me, Lieutenant.

01:22:45.754 --> 01:22:46.838
Lieutenant!

01:23:00.659 --> 01:23:01.702
Lieutenant.

01:23:06.869 --> 01:23:10.309
What the hell, kid!
You're so stubborn!

01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:12.546
I've warned you, didn't I?

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:15.375
Why did you mess with your boss?

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:18.292
Lieutenant.

01:23:18.317 --> 01:23:21.430
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
Please forgive me.

01:23:21.893 --> 01:23:24.584
I didn't mean to, Lieutenant.

01:23:25.347 --> 01:23:27.975
I really love Adelyn!

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.950
I won't leave her, Lieutenant!

01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:31.768
Please have mercy on me!

01:23:32.135 --> 01:23:34.360
Lieutenant, please have mercy on us!

01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:36.470
You dumbass!

01:23:36.495 --> 01:23:38.914
- Lieutenant!
- Shut up!

01:23:41.198 --> 01:23:43.869
If I give you another chance,

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:46.372
- Lieutenant!
- forget about this place.

01:23:46.503 --> 01:23:50.125
Go far away. Stop your foolishness!

01:23:50.687 --> 01:23:51.938
Do you understand?

01:23:53.814 --> 01:23:55.190
Look at me.

01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:59.468
Look at me!

01:24:00.599 --> 01:24:02.100
You damn idiot!

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.307
If you truly love that woman...

01:24:05.803 --> 01:24:07.815
and want her to live,

01:24:08.235 --> 01:24:09.570
stop now.

01:24:12.243 --> 01:24:13.870
Don't do it for yourself,

01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:16.409
do it for her.

01:24:17.526 --> 01:24:19.569
I'll let you go again this time.

01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:26.370
But if I see even a hint of
your shadow in this place,

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.120
I will end you!

01:24:28.628 --> 01:24:29.920
Do you understand?

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:32.643
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:34.545
- Answer me!
- Yes, Lieutenant!

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.281
Yes, Lieutenant!

01:24:38.597 --> 01:24:40.140
Yes, I'm sorry, Lieutenant!

01:24:40.165 --> 01:24:41.708
Damn idiot.

01:25:29.816 --> 01:25:32.110
Let's start over again, sweetmeat.

01:25:34.018 --> 01:25:35.395
I'm really sorry.

01:25:38.692 --> 01:25:40.319
I won't hurt you again.

01:25:42.922 --> 01:25:46.176
Look, I know I ain't perfect
and all, but...

01:25:48.136 --> 01:25:51.056
you know I do my best to take care
of you and your family.

01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:55.167
Come on.

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:03.550
Let me do right by you this time.

01:26:04.927 --> 01:26:06.553
Let me start over fresh.

01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:14.278
I miss you.

01:26:24.238 --> 01:26:25.362
I'm sorry.

01:26:35.655 --> 01:26:36.729
Hello.

01:26:37.503 --> 01:26:38.585
Jake.

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.653
Yes, she's here.
It's just the two of us.

01:26:44.714 --> 01:26:45.843
Alright.

01:26:46.885 --> 01:26:47.982
Ma'am.

01:26:50.643 --> 01:26:51.807
Jake?

01:27:01.387 --> 01:27:04.223
You know, after this whole deal
went down with Yee...

01:27:04.508 --> 01:27:06.924
and Lopez, sons of bitches.

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:08.882
You know what Agusto?

01:27:08.907 --> 01:27:11.432
I don't even know
who I can trust anymore.

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:15.371
Seems like everybody
wants a piece of my money.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.453
Trying to play me for a fool.

01:27:22.186 --> 01:27:24.855
Hell, I don't even know
if I can trust Jake.

01:27:25.656 --> 01:27:27.449
Boys got something about him.

01:27:27.474 --> 01:27:28.987
Really crafty, I'm telling you.

01:27:30.627 --> 01:27:31.676
You know what?

01:27:32.905 --> 01:27:35.199
Those boys in the States, I'm telling you.

01:27:35.929 --> 01:27:37.639
They probably got something.

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:41.846
I'm sure they got all kinds of ideas.

01:29:08.297 --> 01:29:10.128
From ma'am Adelyn.

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:12.664
Everything you'll need is there.

01:29:15.039 --> 01:29:16.354
Thank you, Jenny.

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:19.588
Is she alright?

01:29:20.317 --> 01:29:21.860
How's Adelyn?

01:29:23.031 --> 01:29:25.867
She's the same, just like before.

01:29:27.588 --> 01:29:28.881
But...

01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:31.884
even if she tries to hide it,

01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:33.927
I feel that...

01:29:36.779 --> 01:29:38.482
she's really sad.

01:29:49.376 --> 01:29:54.506
Stay here for a while, have dinner,
you've traveled far.

01:29:54.531 --> 01:29:58.952
Don't mind me. I just dropped by
for ma'am Adelyn,

01:29:59.411 --> 01:30:03.081
and... my child needs me
at the hospital.

01:30:04.641 --> 01:30:07.936
I'm still far from home
and I need to catch the bus.

01:30:07.961 --> 01:30:10.510
I really need to go.

01:30:10.987 --> 01:30:12.034
Jenny.

01:30:16.034 --> 01:30:17.054
Thank you.

01:30:19.298 --> 01:30:20.674
Have a safe trip.

01:30:22.935 --> 01:30:24.770
Be careful, too, Jake.

01:30:25.223 --> 01:30:26.892
You both be careful.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.659
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:33:29.684 --> 01:33:33.075
You just sneak up on me
and try to kill me!

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.769
Who do you think you are?!

01:33:48.348 --> 01:33:49.975
Damn you!

01:33:54.187 --> 01:33:55.439
That's enough. That's enough.

01:35:23.401 --> 01:35:24.444
Jake.

01:35:29.081 --> 01:35:30.541
Don't worry.

01:35:31.294 --> 01:35:33.268
Nothing can come between us.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.456
We are free.

01:35:46.473 --> 01:35:50.542
There's a price for
happiness and freedom.

01:35:56.191 --> 01:36:00.229
Jake, we need that to be truly happy.

01:36:01.905 --> 01:36:03.323
This is it.

01:36:11.019 --> 01:36:14.606
I love you. Have faith in me.

01:36:16.475 --> 01:36:17.809
Please.

01:36:22.525 --> 01:36:24.860
This is the real world.

01:36:27.756 --> 01:36:32.595
We need to survive. We need money.

01:36:35.413 --> 01:36:38.219
And I only took what we need.

01:38:52.563 --> 01:38:53.815
Thank you, kid!

01:38:56.567 --> 01:38:59.195
We tried before,
but it failed.

01:38:59.996 --> 01:39:01.436
You're a perfect replacement.

01:39:04.124 --> 01:39:05.500
Because of you,

01:39:06.193 --> 01:39:08.328
everything went as planned.

01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:11.418
Someone will finally
take the blame for this.

01:39:12.352 --> 01:39:13.728
Everything is connected now.

01:39:14.293 --> 01:39:16.337
You murdered Mr. Stonehill,

01:39:17.402 --> 01:39:19.487
took his money and jewelries,

01:39:19.512 --> 01:39:20.889
While I,

01:39:22.927 --> 01:39:25.193
I am the star of this story.

01:39:26.786 --> 01:39:27.914
I am the hero...

01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:31.941
who caught and killed the person
who committed the crime,

01:39:32.602 --> 01:39:33.687
while I...

01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:36.952
and my future wife...

01:39:39.238 --> 01:39:43.294
will inherit all the wealth
of her late husband.

01:41:07.539 --> 01:41:08.665
You know, Jake?

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:14.875
I can't entrust my life to the promises
and love of men anymore.

01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:19.090
I've learned my lesson, Jake.

01:41:23.912 --> 01:41:25.747
I did love you.

01:41:26.574 --> 01:41:28.993
I had a great time with you...

01:41:30.439 --> 01:41:33.317
but I love myself more now.

01:41:35.023 --> 01:41:36.357
For me,

01:41:39.795 --> 01:41:43.132
there's nothing greater than that love.

01:41:50.413 --> 01:41:51.706
Goodbye, Jake.

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:54.164
Goodbye, my love.

01:41:58.546 --> 01:41:59.672
I love you, Adâ€”
