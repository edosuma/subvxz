00:03.469 --> 00:06.200
<i>[Jill] # Wild thing, I think I love you</i>

00:06.272 --> 00:11.232
<i># But I want to know for sure</i>

00:11.311 --> 00:14.542
<i># So, come on and hold me tight</i>

00:14.614 --> 00:17.344
<i>[humming]</i>

00:17.417 --> 00:19.476
<i># I love you #</i>

00:20.186 --> 00:22.848
<i>[humming]</i>

00:22.922 --> 00:25.049
[laughs]

00:26.659 --> 00:28.593
[Wilson laughs] My, neighborette!

00:28.661 --> 00:31.630
You seem awfully tickled
to be getting rid of that garbage.

00:31.731 --> 00:35.098
No, no, no. l'm just excited
because l'm going to a hardware show.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.730
Who are you
and what have you done with Jill?

00:40.807 --> 00:42.934
No, no. l love these hardware shows

00:43.009 --> 00:45.842
<i>because when Tim goes and does
the Tool Time remote...</i>

00:45.912 --> 00:48.642
- [Wilson] Hmm.
- ...l get to spend time with my boys.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.811
Ohh. Well, l remember spending
quality time with my mother.

00:52.886 --> 00:58.051
We'd bake cookies, then astral project
ourselves to an alternate universe.

00:59.492 --> 01:02.655
Well, we're just driving to Cleveland.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.992
- Also fun.
- Yeah.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.125
We've done these trips with
the boys since they were little.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.725
l remember this one trip.

01:09.803 --> 01:14.638
We went to Chicago and Randy vomited
all over the Sears Tower elevator.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.206
[sighs] Ah, memories.

01:17.277 --> 01:21.714
Mmm. l'm excited this time. l'm taking
them to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.750
They will love that.
Boy, you are one happenin' mama!

01:24.818 --> 01:28.254
- Hey, l'm ''a wild thing!''
- ''You make my heart sing!''

01:28.321 --> 01:32.451
<i>[both] # You make everything groovy #</i>

01:32.525 --> 01:33.958
[Jill laughs]

01:34.027 --> 01:36.552
Hey, guys, l just put
octane boost in the Nomad.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.655
Which means the car might arrive
in Cleveland before we do.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.667
Tim, l've got that extra suitcase
you wanted for the show.

01:42.735 --> 01:45.704
- Outstanding.
- That is six suitcases you're taking.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.799
Do you really need to bring home every
single sample from the hardware show?

01:53.646 --> 01:55.705
Of course you do.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.682
- [Wilson] Here we go, Tim.
- Thanks.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.719
Oh, Jill, while you're at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,

02:00.787 --> 02:04.279
make sure and look at the exhibit
on my old friends The Beatles.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.257
No. Like you really knew the Beatles?

02:06.326 --> 02:09.294
- [Wilson] Mm-hmm.
- Big deal. l knew Black & Decker.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.632
- Was Paul really that cute in person?
- Cuter.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.067
You want to know cute?
l'll introduce you to Sherwin Williams.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.719 --> 03:09.586
We need another cart
for their luggage, alright?

03:10.990 --> 03:13.015
Well, boys, here we are in Cleveland.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.458
- What do you want to do first?
- l gotta go pee.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.428
Me, too!

03:17.497 --> 03:20.466
l know you're excited,
but we could've made one rest stop.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.902
You know the rule, don't you? No rest
stops unless we change time zones.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.906
Ten minutes more into this, we would've
changed more than time zones.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.945
- Hey, Tool Man! Lou Michaels...
- Lou Michaels!

03:34.013 --> 03:37.380
- ...Precision Bathroom Fixtures.
- Good to see you. This is Jill.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.815
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

03:38.885 --> 03:42.377
- Fine, thanks.
- Here. Have a sample toilet brush!

03:44.490 --> 03:47.152
''Always brush after every flush.''

03:48.328 --> 03:50.888
lt's inspirational, Lou.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.489
l'd better check in.
lt was nice to meet you, Lou.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.433
You too, Jill.
Hey! This is my son Kevin, Tim.

03:56.502 --> 03:57.935
- Good to meet you.
- Hi.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.529
- There's my middle son, Randy.
- Hey! How are you?

04:00.607 --> 04:03.167
Nice to meet you.
What kind of computer you got?

04:03.243 --> 04:08.806
A notebook with a Power PC processor,
64 megs of RAM, and a 33.6 modem.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.879
[grunting laughter]

04:14.587 --> 04:17.351
- Your suite's all ready, Mrs. Taylor.
- Oh, thanks.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.051
Do you have brochures
on things to do in Cleveland?

04:20.125 --> 04:22.287
l'm going to the
Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.263
You're in luck. There's a
fascinating exhibit called,

04:25.331 --> 04:29.665
- ''The Changing Face of Rock and Roll.''
- What's that about? Michael Jackson?

04:36.009 --> 04:40.912
Mrs. Taylor, we take our rock and roll
very seriously here in Cleveland.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.013
- l guess.
- Problem?

04:45.084 --> 04:47.848
- No. Everything's fine. What's that?
- Toilet brush.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.016
- No, that.
- Oh. Sample pool skimmer.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.993
We don't have a pool to skim.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.088
l'm hoping it will work on your gravy.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.200
Guys, l've got so many fun
things planned today.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.901
We got the zoo, and Jacobs Field,

05:09.976 --> 05:13.139
and the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame,
and...

05:16.683 --> 05:20.779
And as punishment for that,
The Doll House and Thimble Museum.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.622
[Mark] Mom, it's Saturday.
We want to sleep.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.421
OK, look, ten more minutes

05:27.493 --> 05:29.961
and then l'm coming in
with this bucket of ice.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.896
[Randy] Could you bring
a couple sodas with that?

05:37.370 --> 05:40.339
- [Jill] Hi.
- l need another suitcase.

05:42.942 --> 05:46.969
You wouldn't believe what the concrete
and brick guys are giving out this year.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.536
[heavy thud]

05:49.615 --> 05:53.711
Where's Brad? l thought he was coming
with you after you set up the booth.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.846
He's having fun, l told him he
could have a couple more hours.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.825
That's OK. Just tell him to be back at
1 2:00, meet us in the lobby for lunch.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.451
[Tim] You got it.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.588
l only got two days with the boys,
l was hoping to start early,

06:05.665 --> 06:08.566
But l can't get Randy
and Mark out of bed.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.797
l got a spare bug bomb.
Want to smoke 'em out of there?

06:13.005 --> 06:17.533
No. But l would like you to try to get
them out of bed... a non-toxic way.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.441
l'd like to, but l gotta
get back to my fans.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.381
l got pictures to take,
autographs to sign.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.385
You know, it's...
it's just not easy being me.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.254
Try being married to you.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.328
lf only that were possible.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.032
[Heidi] Here you go.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.470
[whistling]

06:58.050 --> 07:01.747
You know, if we did a swimsuit calendar,
they'd want our autograph, too.

07:01.821 --> 07:05.188
lf you did a swimsuit calendar,
we'd be kicked off the air.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.653
Coming to you from the
Cleveland Hardware Expo it's...

07:10.730 --> 07:12.357
<i>[all] Tool Time!</i>

07:12.432 --> 07:13.990
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.728
There's nothing like the
Cleveland Hardware Expo.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.934
lt's a... it's a gala event

07:20.006 --> 07:23.669
that showcases the most innovative
products in the marketplace today.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.371
We're at the
Precision Bathroom Fixtures booth,

07:26.446 --> 07:29.574
where they're showcasing
an interesting new product.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.415
lt's actually a home urinal system,
believe it or not.

07:33.519 --> 07:38.354
<i>lt's called Potty Pal.
Right away l know the value of this.</i>

07:38.424 --> 07:41.393
Lou, tell the audience
why they'd be interested in this.

07:41.494 --> 07:45.396
Well, Tim, it only uses
ten ounces of water per visit.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.023
- Ten ounces? Well.
- Yes.

07:47.099 --> 07:50.796
And it mounts flush with the wall.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.774
And as you can see, it comes
in a host of fine decorator colors.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.610
Well, my favorites would have to be
the Seafoam Green and the Biscuit.

08:03.749 --> 08:08.709
And as you also can see,
it opens up just like a mailbox.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.892
You want to look out for that
''return to sender'' feature, though.

08:15.294 --> 08:18.821
Hot things are happening here
at the All Seasons lnsulation booth.

08:18.898 --> 08:22.925
They're offering an interesting product
called cellulose blown insulation.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.096
lt's made entirely out of newspaper.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.006
This is an environmentally sound way
to keep your home... comfortable.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.176
Plus, if you're ever
stuck inside your wall,

08:33.279 --> 08:35.337
you'll always have something to read.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.114
You just pick it out and...

08:39.184 --> 08:41.015
...uh, over to you, Tim.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.352
''Something to read!''

08:45.458 --> 08:49.292
We're at the Frankfort Fan Company
located in Frankfort, Michigan.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.729
There's nothing l like better
than my fans. Just like my fans,

08:52.798 --> 08:55.767
these fans come in a variety
of sizes, shapes and colors.

08:55.835 --> 08:59.100
From big, portable cooling units
with six-horsepower motors,

08:59.171 --> 09:02.038
to a very innovative little
combination light and fan.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.544
Light up your workshop and get
rid of toxic fumes at the same time.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.079
So have that extra bowl of chili, guys.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.910
lt flips on just...

09:10.983 --> 09:14.146
Whoa... uh, look at that,
a handy plug, too.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.383
Plug her in...

09:16.656 --> 09:18.886
[whirring]

09:20.293 --> 09:23.057
Turn it off!

09:23.129 --> 09:25.791
Tim! Turn it off!

09:25.865 --> 09:29.494
Somebody turn off the power!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.696
Turn it off!

09:33.339 --> 09:36.672
Tim! Tim!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.171
Turn off the power!

09:43.282 --> 09:44.909
Off!

09:47.153 --> 09:49.587
[panting]

09:50.990 --> 09:52.685
Um...

09:54.827 --> 09:57.455
l'm, l'm terribly sorry.
l'm terribly sorry.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.997
What are you talking about?

09:59.065 --> 10:01.590
The Tool Man pulling
a stunt like this in my booth

10:01.667 --> 10:03.897
is going to be great publicity!

10:03.970 --> 10:06.530
How do you think up these gags?

10:08.274 --> 10:12.005
Well, the trick is
making it look like an accident.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.020
[bell dings]

10:23.456 --> 10:26.914
So, Mrs. Taylor, what sights
have you seen so far?

10:26.993 --> 10:30.019
l wanted to go to Jacobs Field,
but nobody else wanted to go.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.862
So, let's see, l've seen...
the hotel vending machine.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.029
Mmm. lmpressive, isn't it?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.569
The Cajun hot fries? My idea.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.073
You're here! Mark and Randy
will be down any minute.

10:44.143 --> 10:48.637
- Where do you want to go for lunch?
- l want to go back to the show.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.478
But you can't be there and be with me.

10:51.550 --> 10:55.179
- Which brings me to my next question.
- You don't want to be with me?

10:55.254 --> 10:57.415
No. lt's not that l don't
want to be with you.

10:57.523 --> 11:01.220
lt's just... l can't be with you
and at the show at the same time,

11:01.293 --> 11:03.227
so... see ya!

11:06.165 --> 11:08.065
[sighs]

11:08.134 --> 11:12.298
Oh, good! Guys, it's only gonna be the
three of us because Brad's not coming.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.895
Uh, Mom? l got a favor to ask.

11:13.973 --> 11:17.602
l ran into that kid, Kevin,
the son of the toilet guy.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.075
Does he want to go
to lunch with us? That's OK.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.445
He can come to the Hall of Fame, too.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.816
Actually, he wants me to go hang out
with him down at the Tower City Mall.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.412
You'd be missing a chance
to see rare memorabilia

11:30.489 --> 11:33.788
from rock and roll legends like
Jimi Hendrix. You love Hendrix.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.192
Mom, l love his music,
l don't need to see his lunch box.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.254
OK.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.857
l thought we were gonna
spend some time together.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.369
What are you saying?
You want me to cancel?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.133
l want you to do
what you want to.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.766
[sighs] l knew you'd understand.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.502
[scoffs]

11:54.580 --> 11:59.040
So, l guess since neither of them want
to spend the day with their mother,

11:59.118 --> 12:02.087
- you don't either.
- Well, it's not that l don't want to.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.520
lt's just... how would it look?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.691
Fine. Nobody has to spend
the day with me. l can entertain myself.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.789
- Cool. l'll be playing video games.
- What about lunch?

12:13.866 --> 12:17.700
l'll get some hot fries
at the vending machine.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.533
My idea.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.080
Hi. We're here at
Bombs Away Pest Control.

12:30.850 --> 12:35.287
These guys will put those
pesky bugs on a fumigation vacation.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.391
Well, the buzzword this year
is ''sonar.''

12:39.492 --> 12:43.451
lt's a process that uses sound waves
to get rid of unwanted pests.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.963
- What time, need to talk.
- [Al] Bees, fleas...

12:46.031 --> 12:50.661
Or this jar filled with
nasty, biting mosquitoes.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.204
Hold on. Just a second. Just a second.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.764
- What is it?
- Well, the boys abandoned me.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.503
You interrupted to tell me that?

12:58.577 --> 13:00.511
Well, l didn't mean for you to stop.

13:00.579 --> 13:04.242
l wanted to signal you so you could
tell me when you had time to talk.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.147
And that signal would be this?

13:08.454 --> 13:13.289
l'm sorry. l was just upset about
the boys not wanting to be with me...

13:15.394 --> 13:17.487
Excuse us, please?

13:17.563 --> 13:21.294
Well, those kids can be so insensitive.
Gotta go.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.869
So, you think this
just isn't very important.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.634
Yes, this is important.
Can we talk about this later?

13:28.707 --> 13:30.971
lt's important to express
feelings when they happen.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.479
When doing TV, it's important
to be on camera when you're taping.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.707
l gotta go to work.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.976
l don't even know why
l try and talk to you.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.244
- Honey, come on! Don't...
- [Al] Hey, Tim!

13:40.352 --> 13:43.685
Oh, you knocked over all the mosquitoes!
This is a disaster!

13:43.756 --> 13:46.281
- [buzzing]
- lt's not a disaster. l planned that.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.519
lt looked just like
an accident, didn't it?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.969
Jill, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

13:58.070 --> 14:00.038
You're upset the boys aren't with you.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.131
They just want to do other things.
Don't take it out on me!

14:04.043 --> 14:06.477
- Mosquito!
- All right, look...

14:06.545 --> 14:10.311
Boys grow up, there's a point in life
they don't want to hang around Mom.

14:13.986 --> 14:17.217
l am not just their mom.
l am their friend. l'm their confidant.

14:17.289 --> 14:20.588
As a psychology student,
you should understand this is normal.

14:20.659 --> 14:24.026
What would you know about normal?

14:24.463 --> 14:27.159
l recognize it in other people.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.404
What are you saying?
l'm not supposed to have feelings?

14:32.471 --> 14:36.032
- Don't bring them to the hardware show!
- OK, fine. Fine!

14:36.108 --> 14:38.269
- You all don't want to be with me.
- Don't...

14:38.377 --> 14:41.540
l'll see Cleveland on my own.
Give me the keys. Where's the car?

14:41.647 --> 14:44.946
ln the structure, three floors down.
Just follow the smell.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.645
What... what smell?

14:47.720 --> 14:51.349
l got some more samples.
The back seat's full of fertilizer.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.921
l'll just take a cab.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.586
[Tim] Al!

15:01.533 --> 15:04.593
- What's on the slate now?
- You're never gonna believe this.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.104
<i>But we're booked solid
with Tool Time remotes.</i>

15:07.172 --> 15:09.868
Thanks to the publicity
we gave the mosquito people,

15:09.942 --> 15:12.604
everybody wants us to
destroy their booth!

15:13.145 --> 15:15.511
- Great hardware show this year.
- Great show.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.674
We're shooting a segment
with heavy machinery. Want to go?

15:18.751 --> 15:22.414
- They got a forklift with a joystick...
- l met some guys at Electrical.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.422
We wanted to check out hot tub models.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.948
- l like the Spa Two Thousand.
- l like Brandy and Heather.

15:28.994 --> 15:32.691
- When you're done, want to hang out?
- No. We want to cruise for a while.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.859
You just met them.
What's more fun than hanging with Dad?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.803
- Dad, you're getting as bad as Mom.
- What is that supposed to mean?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.033
Mom wants me to hang
with her this weekend,

15:42.107 --> 15:44.166
who hangs with their mom on vacation?

15:44.243 --> 15:46.734
Al.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.080
This is an important weekend for her.

15:49.148 --> 15:53.414
You're saying if l look at forklifts
with you it's gonna make Mom happy?

15:53.485 --> 15:55.851
l don't care if you don't want
to see forklifts.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.082
l think you should
try to be nicer to Mom.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.717
All right. l'll be nicer
when l get home.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.424
Tim! Guess what?

16:04.530 --> 16:08.626
The forklifts are right next to
the plate glass window display.

16:11.403 --> 16:14.304
Just think of the possibilities there.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.770
You guys do this segment, l got
an errand to do. l'll be back in a bit.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.217
Well, Al, feel like
breaking some glass?

16:26.418 --> 16:29.683
[sighs] lt's just not
the same without Tim.

16:31.724 --> 16:35.490
<i>[man on TV] The hotel offers a free
buffet breakfast, workout facilities,</i>

16:35.594 --> 16:40.930
<i>sauna, hair salon and a premium vending
machine now featuring Cajun hot fries.</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.763
<i>My idea.</i>

16:45.804 --> 16:47.237
<i>[TV o</i>

16:49.174 --> 16:50.607
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.940
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.378
l raided the mini-bar.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.242
l'm now working on my
single serving of pistachios,

16:59.318 --> 17:03.482
my individual wedge of Gouda, and my
three-ounce can of cranapple cooler.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.287
And all for only $88.

17:09.728 --> 17:13.686
- Have you been here all afternoon?
- No. l've been all over town.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.029
l went to the zoo, by myself,

17:16.101 --> 17:18.569
after having lunch, by myself.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.003
And then, l went to
the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

17:22.074 --> 17:26.032
- By yourself.
- No. With Roy Belasco.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.512
- Who's Roy Belasco?
- My cab driver.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.986
Here's a picture of me and Roy,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.614
in front of Elvis's deep-fryer.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.386
- l know how you're feeling.
- Oh, well...

17:42.461 --> 17:46.090
There's no way for you to imagine it
until you're standing this far...

17:46.165 --> 17:49.225
...from Bob Dylan's
third-grade report card.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.961
That's a ''D'' in Chorus, by the way.

17:53.038 --> 17:56.872
No. l mean, l know how you're feeling
about missing the boys.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.434
You do?

17:59.511 --> 18:02.412
l asked Brad to go
look at forklifts with me.

18:02.481 --> 18:06.417
He didn't want to. So, l know
what you're going through here.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.384
Have some honey-roasted peanuts.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.418
Only $1 8.

18:17.262 --> 18:21.221
lt seems like just yesterday that all
they wanted to do was be around us.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.234
lt's going way too fast.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.134
You know, every year...

18:26.205 --> 18:30.232
...l fill the attic with boxes of
clothes they've outgrown that l just...

18:30.309 --> 18:31.742
...can't bear to give away.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.778
- [sad laugh]
- lt just breaks my heart.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.337
- Remember that cowboy outfit of Mark's?
- Yeah.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.349
l used to sneak into his room at night

18:38.417 --> 18:41.284
and pry it off him so l could wash it.

18:41.353 --> 18:44.686
Do you remember those
little racecar jammies of Randy's?

18:44.756 --> 18:47.190
Remember? l looked for one in my size.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.592
l recently found
Brad's Cub Scout uniform up there.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.999
Did you know he got more merit
badges than any of the other kids?

18:58.070 --> 19:01.528
Sure he did. lt didn't hurt
that l was his pack leader.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.101
You were great.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.144
On those camping trips,

19:06.211 --> 19:10.773
that was one place your fire-starting
skills came in handy.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.709
There's something weird going on here.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.845
You spend your whole life raising kids.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.790
When they get to the age where they're
cool to hang around, they ditch you.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.491
- Which is what we want.
- [surprised grunt]

19:26.765 --> 19:30.030
Well, we want them
to be more independent.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.333
l mean, you're the one who said
that it was natural for them

19:33.405 --> 19:35.339
- to pull away from us.
- No, no, no, no.

19:35.407 --> 19:38.570
What l said was it's natural
for them to pull away from you.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.109
Now, we just gotta hope
that they come back.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.640
They'll come back... for money.

19:48.954 --> 19:53.323
l just don't want this to be like my
relationship with my parents, you know?

19:53.425 --> 19:56.883
Because l've worked so hard
to be close to them.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.987
Oh, cut it out.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.589
You're closer than
any mom l know to your sons.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.828
They talk to you.

20:04.803 --> 20:08.068
Randy even talks about
his girl problems with you, honey.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.574
Yeah, he does. He does that.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.773
Brad even asks for my advice on clothes.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.814
Mark hugs you.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.610
Yeah.

20:18.684 --> 20:22.051
- Aw, l guess they still like me some.
- Oh, sure they do.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.153
You know, there's a...

20:25.224 --> 20:28.352
...there's a benefit to them
not being around all the time.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.190
What?

20:34.099 --> 20:36.260
l'll lock the door.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.666
You bring my nuts.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.072
[Wilson] Jill, l can't thank you enough

20:48.146 --> 20:52.276
for bringing back this photo
from the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.085
- [Jill] Well, you're welcome.
- You know, l was the cute one.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.950
What is this?

21:02.027 --> 21:05.724
We made you a gift because of how upset
you were about the boys growing up.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.766
And we felt bad about
deserting you in Cleveland.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.327
lt's a quilt.

21:13.038 --> 21:16.064
lt's made out of the boys' old clothes.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.510
You did this all by yourselves?

21:22.414 --> 21:24.644
Yes, you did!

21:25.117 --> 21:27.449
l got all the old clothes
from the attic.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.851
We took it to Al's
and had a man's quilting bee.

21:29.921 --> 21:33.288
He makes a delicious banana bread.

21:33.525 --> 21:36.289
- Do you like it?
- l love it. lt's amazing.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.659
- l can't believe you did this.
- Look. Look.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.664
There's the cowboy outfit.

21:40.732 --> 21:45.101
Oh, look. lt still has the hole in it
where Randy shot him with the arrow.

21:45.837 --> 21:48.806
- My Cub Scout uniform from 2nd grade.
- Oh, my God, yes!

21:48.874 --> 21:50.899
- And my racecar pajamas.
- Oh...

21:51.710 --> 21:53.541
l don't recognize this piece here.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.979
Those are the boxers l wore
when l proposed to you.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.410
You saved them all these years?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.784
Until last week l was still wearing 'em.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.518
Maybe they just want
to do other things.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.063
- Don't take it out on me!
- No, it's a mosquito!

22:13.131 --> 22:15.827
Must've been a big one.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.869
Well, Al, feel like
breaking some glass?

22:22.040 --> 22:25.737
[sighs] lt's just not the same
without Tim.
