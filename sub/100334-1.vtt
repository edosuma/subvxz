01:37.965 --> 01:41.166
[music continues]

01:42.903 --> 01:47.172
I, Dr. Alan Stone, am guilty

01:47.174 --> 01:52.244
for underestimating
the enigma that is the mind.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.716
But I am not guilty
of the accusations

01:57.718 --> 01:59.051
leveled against me.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.586

My defense for this hearing

02:57.011 --> 02:58.744
really a witch hunt

at Ypsilanti.

[knock on door]

03:04.985 --> 03:06.518
Yes?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.154
Sorry to disturb you, Dr. Stone.
My name's Benny.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.223
The attending physician
is off-ward.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.625
We need help with a patient,
Joseph Cassel

03:13.627 --> 03:15.093
he's down here on C-18.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.328
Alright.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.663
[yells]

03:17.665 --> 03:20.165
Alright, put it down,
Mr. Cassel.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.767
You're -- you're gonna be fine.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.502
I, Jesus of Nazareth

03:23.504 --> 03:26.872

03:35.149 --> 03:38.217
Who do you think you are?

03:39.286 --> 03:41.186
Thank you, Dr. Francisco.

03:41.188 --> 03:45.557
Saving someone
who doesn't want to live.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.559
Some irony.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.530
You must be
the new guy from MSU.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.799
- Stone, right?
- That's right.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.135
No electrocution.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.634
What in God's name would
cause you to miss Lenny Bruce's

04:28.636 --> 04:30.235
only night in Michigan?

04:30.237 --> 04:33.305
Well, actually,
it was a patient's life.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.407
Of course.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.875
Who?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.777
Jesus Christ.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.480
Life in a mental hospital?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.015
Yeah.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.453
And that, Alan?

04:48.455 --> 04:51.189
That is life
in a state mental hospital.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.830
[moaning]

05:00.034 --> 05:02.234
Enjoy yourself, Ruth.
Enjoy yourself.

the children to hear.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.138

<i> Sir! Excuse me, sir!</i>

You saved me from electrocution.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.890
My gratitude is infinite.

Here is a present

05:26.360 --> 05:30.262

the sweetness of it all.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.163
Thank you.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.232
No, no, not giving it to you.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.872
Play it. Play it.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.446
I would really like to help you,
Joseph.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.781
Please address me

07:02.189 --> 07:04.022
Thank you, Mr. Benson.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.090
My name is Christ

07:05.092 --> 07:06.992
but I am not from Nazareth

07:06.994 --> 07:08.226
to be precise.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.328
Yes.

07:10.330 --> 07:14.065
Well, I'm sorry, but your actual
name is Mr. Clyde Benson.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.342
So if I refer to you
by your actual name

07:24.344 --> 07:25.877
you won't speak?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.314
<i> Hm?</i>

07:30.818 --> 07:35.086
Alright then, I think our time
together is finished.

Wet cement.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.831
<i> Wet cement?</i>

07:45.833 --> 07:47.732

- That is funny.

Two, two different toothpastes.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.081
Can there be two Jesus'?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.484
There can be
but only one son of God.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.785
That's my point.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.454
Then why am I tortured
by a pretender in our midst?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.524
- Mr. Cassel.
- That's his name.

08:12.526 --> 08:16.261
But he goes by a fraudulent one,
does he not?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.301
And now <i> you</i> are silent.

08:26.473 --> 08:29.007
Yes. Yes, now I am.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.677
[crickets chirping]

08:34.448 --> 08:38.383
Freud said there were
two basic instincts.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.019
- What were they again?
- You know the answer.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.153
Tell me anyway.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.688
Sex and aggression.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.600
Mm.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.937
What?

08:58.939 --> 09:02.207
Well, now I have two patients

09:02.209 --> 09:04.276
who believe
they're Jesus Christ.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.612
What do you plan
to do about that?

09:07.614 --> 09:11.750
Why don't you tell me,
Ms. Summa Cum Laude?

09:11.752 --> 09:14.486
Will you ever get over
that I'm smarter than you?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.159
No.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.394
[screaming]

09:22.396 --> 09:23.261
Help me, my son.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.729
I, your Lord Christ

09:24.731 --> 09:25.964
the righteous one, beg thee

09:25.966 --> 09:29.067
to curtail this barbarism.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.803
They are frying my notes.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.305
Benny, what happened?
What happened? What happened?

09:33.307 --> 09:34.839
Joseph got into a fight
with Clyde Benson

09:34.841 --> 09:36.541
who also claims
he's Jesus Christ.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.044
Joseph got upset and said there
could only be one Jesus

09:39.046 --> 09:41.012
and then Benson
broke his record.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.547
Oh..

09:44.651 --> 09:46.284
[Cassel groaning]

09:46.286 --> 09:49.554
Dr. Francisco,
is shock really necessary?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.156
Well,
Mr. Cassel became uncontrollable

09:51.158 --> 09:53.925
over that broken vinyl.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.760
Is there a problem?

09:55.762 --> 09:59.097
Do you have some magical cure
you're not sharing?

10:00.367 --> 10:01.333
No.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.069
Please allow me
to leave Michigan

10:04.071 --> 10:05.971
and return to England.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.739
No.

[instrumental music]

10:49.149 --> 10:51.216
<i> Be seated, please.</i>

10:52.653 --> 10:54.352
So you've left academia

10:54.354 --> 10:56.421
to join us
at Ypsilanti State Hospital.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.789
- Yes.
- Welcome.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.257
Thank you, Dr. Orbus.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.393
Your papers make
for interesting reading.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.961
What can I do for you?

11:02.963 --> 11:06.531
Well, I've received multiple
grants from Michigan State

11:06.533 --> 11:10.335
to include schizophrenics
in my identity studies.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.237
I need your support.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.638
What kind of support?

11:13.640 --> 11:14.939
Additional manpower.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.608
And your word that electroshock

11:16.610 --> 11:18.677
will never be used
on my patients.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.713
Hm.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.749
Your article states

11:24.751 --> 11:28.486
"Institutions are a warehouse
for mental patients

11:28.488 --> 11:32.424
run like an automotive factory."
Ah-ha.

11:32.426 --> 11:35.293
You don't think that sounds
just a tad disrespectful

11:35.295 --> 11:36.861
if not insulting?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.163
I wrote truthfully.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.931
Ever worked in a state facility?

11:39.933 --> 11:42.634
I'm sorry, was I factually
incorrect about the procedure?

11:42.636 --> 11:44.536
You haven't worked
in a state facility.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.505
As someone who does, please,
how would you suggest

11:47.507 --> 11:50.675
we offer more humane care
to over 4100 patients

11:50.677 --> 11:52.444
we, a staff
of five psychiatrists?

11:52.446 --> 11:55.847
I understand the scope of
your problems, believe me I do.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.182
Your supervisor invited me here.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.383
Dr. Rogers. Certainly.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.218
Why not look to improve
the quality

12:00.220 --> 12:01.553
of the care that you offer here?

12:01.555 --> 12:03.154
Because the methods that we use

12:03.156 --> 12:04.255
which are standard nationwide

12:04.257 --> 12:06.891
are not good enough?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.526
How did you refer to us?

12:08.528 --> 12:12.864
"Bureaucratic
unfeeling conformists."

12:12.866 --> 12:15.233
Such restraint.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.469
I have no additional manpower.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.371
And if you create an unsafe
environment for my patients

12:20.373 --> 12:22.173
you'll be removed.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.876
Dr. Rogers won't overrule me
on that.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.413
[scoffs]

12:28.415 --> 12:31.616
I'm told I make a really good
second impression.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.287
<i> Ah, schizophrenia</i>
<i> is a mental condition</i>

12:36.289 --> 12:37.756
that makes it hard
to tell the difference

12:37.758 --> 12:39.424
between what's real
and not real

12:39.426 --> 12:41.192
uh, think clearly

12:41.194 --> 12:43.528
have appropriate
emotional responses

12:43.530 --> 12:45.463
act normally
in social situations.

12:45.465 --> 12:50.001
Okay, you are graduating
from Eastern Michigan College

12:50.003 --> 12:51.736
with a degree in psychology.

12:51.738 --> 12:55.173
Full scholarship,
excellent grades

12:55.175 --> 12:56.574
with a year hiatus.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.176
I had some family issues.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.111
I -- I have recommendations.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.280
Oh, excellent ones.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.816
May I ask what kind of issues?

13:06.052 --> 13:07.585
Do I have to answer?

13:09.156 --> 13:12.357
No. No, you don't.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.563
You understand
just how difficult

13:18.565 --> 13:21.299
working with paranoid
schizophrenics can be.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.069
I know they lack inhibitions,
and their speech is bizarre.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.371
Neological.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.340
Their words actually hide
the meaning

13:29.342 --> 13:30.975
of what they're thinking.

13:30.977 --> 13:35.113
These patients may appear
to see right through you

13:35.115 --> 13:39.617
<i> pinpoint your doubts, your</i>
<i> sexual impulses, your fears.</i>

13:39.619 --> 13:42.954
- How?
- They tend to be
highly perceptive.

13:42.956 --> 13:47.125
For instance,
you say that you have an issue

13:47.127 --> 13:50.094
<i> they may intuit what it is</i>

13:50.096 --> 13:52.397
<i> or challenge you aggressively.</i>

13:52.399 --> 13:54.566
It's very important for me
to help people.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.069
Won't I learn how to do that
if I work on this project?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.370
Probably.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.441
Why do you wanna work
with paranoid schizophrenics?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.378
[chuckles]

14:10.483 --> 14:12.684
Because they're so lonely.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.557
Whatever happens..

14:19.559 --> 14:23.161
...you cannot be seduced
into their world

14:23.163 --> 14:25.430
you will be unable to help them.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.433
And if it ever becomes too much,
too personal

14:28.435 --> 14:31.436
too difficult,
you will have to withdraw.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.905
Does that mean I'm hired?

14:33.907 --> 14:36.841
[chuckles]
Yes, Ms. Anderson,
you're hired.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.309
[laughs]

14:38.311 --> 14:40.845
I'm Becky. I won't let you down.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.450
Find out
if there are other patients

14:45.452 --> 14:47.652
in the Michigan Mental Health

Alright.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.633
Leon Gabor. That's it?

15:01.635 --> 15:04.903
Ah, we've got three
Cinderella's, two Eisenhower's

15:04.905 --> 15:08.973
one Duke Ellington, but only
one more Jesus in Michigan.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.042
Good job.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.380
Good morning.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.782
My name is Dr. Stone.

15:17.784 --> 15:21.552
This is my research assistant,
Ms. Anderson.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.887
Would you like to sit down,
Mr. Gabor?

15:22.889 --> 15:27.191
- I'd like to get to know you.
- Why?

15:27.193 --> 15:30.228
Maybe if I understand you better

15:30.230 --> 15:31.963
perhaps I can be of help to you.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.366
You wanna be my friend?

15:35.368 --> 15:36.935
I'd like to be your doctor.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.403
But not my friend.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.372
- Friendly doctor.
- Why not my friend?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.075
Well, because there are
certain boundaries

15:44.077 --> 15:49.080
between a doctor
and his patient, Mr. Gabor.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.150
Address me by my righteous name.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.685
God, to you.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.524
I don't believe you're God.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.527
So you don't acknowledge
who I am

16:02.529 --> 16:05.730
yet you want me
to acknowledge who you are.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.267
Were you born a doctor, Stone?
What is a stone? A rock?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.469
Was it even your birth name?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.508
[scoffs]
No.

16:19.879 --> 16:23.081
What is your name?
Who are you?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.083
I am a doctor.
I'm here to treat you.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.552
And I really have no need
to win a debate with you.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.120
So you won't tell me
who is treating me

16:29.122 --> 16:32.757
yet you insist that I am not
who I tell you that I am.

16:32.759 --> 16:36.060
Huh. Do you even believe in God?

16:37.464 --> 16:38.963
That's not easy to answer.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.665
Yes or no works for me.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.902
I believe in the mystery.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.738
But not God.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.139
- I believe in nature.
- But not God?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.241
I believe in science,
cause and effect.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.943
But not God.

16:55.048 --> 16:59.684
I find it very hard to believe
in an all-powerful God

16:59.686 --> 17:02.754
who allows children to suffer..

17:02.756 --> 17:04.756
...wars to be fought
in his name.

17:04.758 --> 17:09.460
I went to war, set people free
that I'd never met

17:09.462 --> 17:13.964
and now I'm being imprisoned
by people that I do not know.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.102
I went to war too.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.839
Tried to save the lives
of soldiers

17:21.840 --> 17:23.708
who were dying for people
they didn't know either.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.410
And you liked that?

17:25.412 --> 17:26.743
Saving people?

17:28.080 --> 17:31.282
Make you feel good?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.317
Make you feel powerful?

17:33.319 --> 17:34.852
Yes.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.656
And how about you,
Ms. Anderson?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.793
Do you believe in God?

17:42.896 --> 17:44.128
Yes.

Well, Molly is questioning

18:02.882 --> 18:05.950
the duck-and-cover drill
at the moment.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.420
Yeah, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.656
Now, what's your project?

18:11.658 --> 18:14.959
Well, I interviewed three
paranoids

18:14.961 --> 18:16.828
who believe
they're Jesus Christ.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.234
I wanna put the three of them
in a room..

18:23.236 --> 18:24.702
...and study their behavior.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.306
- Three Christ's?
- Yeah.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.641
What do you think will happen?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.276
I don't have a clue.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.045
They aren't who they are,
so who are they?

18:34.047 --> 18:35.713
- Yeah.
- It's interesting.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.117
Maybe one of them
will dominate the others

18:39.119 --> 18:41.586
force them to change
their identities.

18:41.588 --> 18:46.657
Maybe -- maybe we will learn
enough that we can help them

18:46.659 --> 18:47.825
give up their delusions.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.360
Alright. Wait. Stop.

You're not talking about
the Holy Grail, right?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.264
Curing schizophrenia?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.133
It -- it is an offshoot

18:55.135 --> 18:57.268
of Dr. Laing's work,
no question about it.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.872
But it's an aggressive
but humane approach.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.740
There's no shock, no drugs.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.309
Alan, you can't cross
the boundaries

19:05.311 --> 19:07.545
of normal clinical protocol.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.846
Did you invite me here?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.281
Did you, did you
encourage me to come here

19:10.283 --> 19:12.650
and do research,
to work with the neglected

19:12.652 --> 19:13.951
those who truly need care?

19:13.953 --> 19:15.586
- The tough cases, right?
- I did.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.288
- Yes, you did.
- And I want you to.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.758
- Good.
- But there are limits
you can't exceed.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.460
I will respect them.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.029
My intention is to separate
the three Christ's

19:25.031 --> 19:26.330
from the general population.

19:26.332 --> 19:30.034
Can you fund any shortfall
in expenses?

19:30.036 --> 19:32.703
Your last paper attacks the very
field that pays your bills.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.739
You want me to cover
your overages?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.107
Will you?

Can you get along
with one of

19:39.746 --> 19:43.915
the "bureaucratic unfeeling
conformists", Dr. Orbus?

19:43.917 --> 19:47.518
If you tell him
not to treat my patients.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.753
Alan, I brought you here

19:48.755 --> 19:51.956

26:38.230 --> 26:40.097
<i> Okay. Calm down.</i>
<i> Come on, come on, come on.</i>

26:40.099 --> 26:41.865
<i> No! No! Stop!</i>

26:41.867 --> 26:45.035
Let go! Let go! Let go!
Stop! Stop!

26:45.037 --> 26:46.470
<i> It's okay. It's alright.</i>

26:46.472 --> 26:48.339
The orderlies must be inside.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.374
They'll inhibit the patients,
you can't do that.

26:50.376 --> 26:54.011
The patients' safety is my
responsibility and mine alone.
Not Dr. Rogers'.

26:54.013 --> 26:58.048
Either the orderlies are inside,
or I'll have to terminate
the experiment.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.683
Fine. Got it.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.921
I am planning on publishing
the results of my work.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.689
- I would like to have
the backing, if possible --
- No, you won't.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.391
I will not have you doing
a hatchet job on Ypsilanti.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.094
- I have no intention of that.
- This is not a debate.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.795
There will be no paper.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.799
I don't know
why I'm getting so worked up.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.536
My physician
says that the stress kills.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.904
Maybe I should meditate
or something.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.573
I don't mean to be
such an obstacle

27:22.575 --> 27:26.677
to everything you propose,
I truly don't.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.680
In fact..

27:29.682 --> 27:34.451
...these are letters
from patient Cassel..

27:34.453 --> 27:37.154
...and, uh, perhaps they'll be
of some use to you.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.356
[instrumental music]

27:55.908 --> 27:57.408
You know what would be nice?

27:57.410 --> 27:59.710
If they could just sit,
play cards together.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.329
You should go home, Becky.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.733
I'm, uh, not finished.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.334
[Stone sighs]

28:25.471 --> 28:28.338
Oh. This is your
new research material?

28:28.340 --> 28:31.608
- That's not what it --
- "Sick Comics."

28:31.610 --> 28:34.578
Mike Nichols, Elaine May,
Lenny Bruce?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.980
Why are you so interested
in Lenny Bruce?

28:36.982 --> 28:38.348
'Cause he's warped.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.784
He's funny, he tells the truth.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.352
And he's from Brooklyn.

28:44.490 --> 28:48.926
Is it possible
to really understand

28:48.928 --> 28:51.795
someone else's delusion?

28:51.797 --> 28:55.499
I think the closest I ever got
was when I experimented
with LSD.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.537
I can heat up dinner
if you're hungry.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.872
No, thanks.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.213
I almost wish I was working on
this project with you

29:09.215 --> 29:11.482
instead of grading
chemistry papers.

29:15.020 --> 29:19.790
Hey, it's brave and important,
what you're doing.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.461
Teacher says,
"Take your medicine."

29:28.734 --> 29:29.767
[grunts]

29:31.771 --> 29:34.238
<i> Alright, Ms. Anderson.</i>
<i> Session One.</i>

29:34.240 --> 29:37.141
<i> November 11th, 1959.</i>

29:37.143 --> 29:41.078
Problematic.
Oh, Leon. Leon, Leon.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.280
Grand Inquisitor.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.849
He will debate, confront,
and taunt you

29:45.851 --> 29:48.385
wanting to provoke
an inappropriate response

29:48.387 --> 29:52.489
<i> but that is his means</i>
<i> of protection.</i>

29:52.491 --> 29:57.861
<i> His attraction to Becky</i>
<i> has thrown him off stride.</i>

29:57.863 --> 30:00.898
<i> It sets off a lot of mixed</i>
<i> sexual feelings.</i>

30:03.536 --> 30:05.269
<i> Come on, Pogo Stick,</i>
<i> I'll be late.</i>

30:05.271 --> 30:07.337
<i> - I'm not a pogo stick.</i>
<i> - Pogo.</i>

30:07.339 --> 30:09.740
-<i> Dad, tell her to stop.</i>
- Stop.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.075
I'm trying to make her stronger

30:12.077 --> 30:15.612
because the boys call her
four eyes, and she cries.

30:15.614 --> 30:18.649
Which boys? I'll have a chat
with the principal.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.318
Shirley, sweetheart,
I call you names too, you know.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.253
Yeah, but I like when you do it.

30:23.255 --> 30:27.357
- Why?
- Because it's fun with you.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.194
If you know who you are..

30:30.196 --> 30:31.995
...it doesn't matter
what the boys say.

30:31.997 --> 30:35.365
- Here. Listen to your father.
- Mm-hmm.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.402
[bird caws]

30:41.574 --> 30:43.140
For Dr. Orbus, kindly, sir.

30:43.142 --> 30:46.043
He has yet to respond,
which is most disrespectful.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.313
How is a man supposed to live
away from his English home?

30:49.315 --> 30:50.848
Like the rest of us.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.550
Please, good doctor,
don't let him destroy my letters

30:53.552 --> 30:55.385
and send me down the drain
with them.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.554
¶ Rotor Rooter
that's the name ¶

30:57.556 --> 31:00.190
¶ And away the troubles
down the drain ¶

31:00.192 --> 31:01.525
¶ Roto Rooter sewer service ¶¶

31:01.527 --> 31:04.862
My good doctor,
someone, and I'm not saying who

31:04.864 --> 31:06.496
stole my glasses.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.198
<i> They weren't stolen,</i>
<i> they were broken.</i>

31:08.200 --> 31:09.833
<i> And you had a fight with Leon.</i>

31:15.407 --> 31:18.909
Alright, Clyde...would you
like to come over

31:18.911 --> 31:22.012
and sit next to Joseph?
Would you do that?

31:22.014 --> 31:23.513
Hmm.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.317
It would make me very happy
if you did that.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.852
Please, could you come?

31:42.067 --> 31:43.467
Come on!

31:54.813 --> 31:56.146
Thank you.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.714
[knock on door]

32:06.392 --> 32:08.325
Clyde, what do you think about
Joseph's claim

32:08.327 --> 32:10.127
to be Jesus Christ?

32:10.129 --> 32:12.529
I am the Lord God

32:12.531 --> 32:15.399
but call me what you will.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.804
Joseph is, uh...very nice

32:20.806 --> 32:22.906
but...little.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.476
But duplicity runs in his veins.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.412
A fraudulent one is he.

32:30.816 --> 32:34.117
Joseph? Are you alright
with Clyde sitting next to you?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.788
There is room for this gentleman

32:37.790 --> 32:40.424
just not in my chair,
if you please, Mr. Clyde Benson.

32:40.426 --> 32:45.095
My odor returns.
Keep your distance. Ho!

32:46.632 --> 32:48.765
- I don't smell anything.
- Nor I.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.868
Well, it's very deep, sir,
it's very deep.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.678
[buzzing]

33:01.680 --> 33:04.047
Electronic interference upstairs

33:04.049 --> 33:06.350

33:06.352 --> 33:10.120
Dr. Francisco powers up
his Frankenstick.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.621
<i> Welcome back, Leon.</i>

33:13.158 --> 33:16.493
Okay, today's goal
is to use your words.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.196
Gabor, don't punch our Cassel.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.597
<i> Exactly.</i>

33:24.436 --> 33:25.769
Do you have a headache, Leon?

33:25.771 --> 33:27.704
No, sir, just shaking it off

33:27.706 --> 33:30.774
the cosmic energy
for the hollowed out gods

33:30.776 --> 33:32.642
and I do not wish to
have any disfigured bodies

33:32.644 --> 33:34.511
being carried out of this place.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.014
[snickers]

33:37.016 --> 33:40.283
You are a dupe, a re-rise hick
next to me. Be careful.

33:40.285 --> 33:43.220
Someone, I'm not saying who,
stole my deck of cards.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.554
Ah.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.227
What are you writing?

33:50.229 --> 33:51.762
Notes for Dr. Stone.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.864
Will those notes
contain my thoughts?

33:57.302 --> 33:58.769
Yes.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.471
And would those notes,
my thoughts belong to you

34:01.473 --> 34:03.206
or to me?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.307
To Dr. Stone.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.776
He owns my thoughts.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.344
Well, I think he owns the notes.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.547
[instrumental music]

34:18.590 --> 34:21.958
No, no. No. No closer.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.962
You frighten everyone.

34:25.964 --> 34:26.797
You made your point

34:26.799 --> 34:29.299
now go back and sit down.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.567
May I?

34:33.172 --> 34:34.871
What, the pen?

34:42.147 --> 34:44.648
It is still warm from your hand

34:44.650 --> 34:47.717
filled with my thoughts..

34:47.719 --> 34:49.585
...which you have taken from me.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.056
They're your thoughts.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.893
No one here owns them, only you.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.061
You're right.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.401
[sniffs]

35:04.403 --> 35:05.936
Lavender.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.778
You will not be the center of
attention in England with me.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.549
I am not engaged to you, sir

35:19.551 --> 35:21.618
but to the one who makes
flowers grow

35:21.620 --> 35:23.220
in the concrete desert.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.525
The reason I'm having
these meetings

35:28.527 --> 35:31.027
is there can only be one Jesus.
True?

35:31.029 --> 35:34.664
- Only one God.
- One God, two rerise hicks.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.600
So if we don't start
responding to names

35:36.602 --> 35:38.468
Shocky Boy will rev up
his generators again?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.203
No Shocky Boy, no.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.905
If, if you spend time together

35:41.907 --> 35:46.943
you don't fight with each other,
maybe play cards.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.819
Stoney Boy.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.957
When you finger fornicate
your wife

36:00.959 --> 36:04.594
is it Ms. Becky's face
that you see?

36:04.596 --> 36:07.898
Is she your orifice
to disfigure?

36:07.900 --> 36:10.133
True love cannot be denied.

36:14.006 --> 36:16.039
Thank you, Leon.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.808
<i> The topic of conversation</i>
<i> today is roots.</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:22.846
Is it possible that
my phonograph and my records

36:22.848 --> 36:24.714
could be brought here?

36:24.716 --> 36:28.618
Because if music
were playing now..

36:28.620 --> 36:31.254
...we would all be divine.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.656
No opera.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.660
That's quite interesting,
the dynamic.

36:36.662 --> 36:37.861
- Challenging, as well.
- Definitely.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.763
And they haven't been fighting

36:39.765 --> 36:41.531
even while living
in the same ward.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.832
But?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.234
I need to speed things up.

36:44.236 --> 36:47.938
I am not going to, uh,
confront them anymore

36:47.940 --> 36:52.842
I'm going to encourage them
to engage each other. Friendly.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.680
Let them run the meetings.
You know, chairman for a day.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.549
I like that. Yeah.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.485
<i> You and Orbus getting on?</i>

37:02.487 --> 37:03.587
Funny you should ask that.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.055
Uh..

37:05.057 --> 37:07.624
I need to avoid
any conflict with him

37:07.626 --> 37:10.660
about publishing the results
of my work.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.697
And you want..

37:13.699 --> 37:15.999
...it to be my idea.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.467
[elevator dings]

37:17.469 --> 37:19.202
Yeah, well, just getting along.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.871
Alan, you are entirely
predictable

37:21.873 --> 37:25.976
but always surprising.
How is that?

37:25.978 --> 37:27.611
My nature?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.783
The transcripts you requested.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.254
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.861
Something else on your mind?

37:46.265 --> 37:49.766
What Leon says about you
thinking about me when..

37:51.436 --> 37:52.702
Leon responds to you

37:52.704 --> 37:55.238
and he notices
that I respond to you

37:55.240 --> 37:57.207
and vice versa.

37:57.209 --> 37:59.109
He's testing us.

37:59.111 --> 38:03.413
But don't worry,
we will never cross that line.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.814
I know that.

38:04.816 --> 38:08.018
[instrumental music]

38:11.123 --> 38:13.723
Very kind of you to invite us,
Mrs. Rogers.

38:13.725 --> 38:17.794
Oh. Vicky, please.
He admires your husband.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.631
And they worked so closely
together in Korea.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.501
Where's Dr. Orbus' wife?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.670
<i> Oh, that's very sad.</i>

38:26.672 --> 38:28.271
She passed almost two years ago

38:28.273 --> 38:30.140
it's a very difficult time
for him.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.944
Drinks have arrived, ladies.

38:34.946 --> 38:38.181
- Thank you.
- Your timing is impeccable.

38:38.183 --> 38:41.951
Dr. Stone, there's an urgent
phone call from the hospital.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.155
[instrumental music]

38:48.560 --> 38:50.093
<i> Get off of me!</i>

38:50.095 --> 38:51.828
<i>Take his arm and pull him down.</i>

38:51.830 --> 38:53.363
[screaming]

39:04.209 --> 39:06.176
[door closes]

39:06.178 --> 39:09.379
- Hi.
- He refuses to get out
of the shower.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.081
<i> I wouldn't let him be</i>
<i> forcibly removed.</i>

39:11.083 --> 39:12.148
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.883
No, that's great. Thank you.

39:13.885 --> 39:18.188
Can you get me
transferred to laundry?

39:18.190 --> 39:22.158
The smells in this kitchen
are nauseating.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.762
Well, we can discuss that,
but you need to come out now.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.031
Well, you don't have to believe
in God

39:28.033 --> 39:29.866
to fear the Devil's Frankenstick

39:29.868 --> 39:30.934
I'll tell you that.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.302
I know, but I promise you

39:32.304 --> 39:33.870
I won't let

39:33.872 --> 39:37.006
Shocky Boy power up
his Frankenstick.

39:39.778 --> 39:44.180
Stay away. I don't, I don't
wanna infect you with my stench.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.182
I don't infect that easily.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.251
You stay away.

39:48.253 --> 39:51.955
I'm alone in here.
Leave me alone.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.758
I'm alone in here.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.394
I don't wanna smell.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.629
I don't wanna smell!

39:59.631 --> 40:01.164
Okay. Don't move.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.899
You don't have to move.
You don't have to move.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.067
I'm just gonna
turn the water off.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.835
Don't move. Don't move.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.405
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.407
- Stay where you are.
- You don't have to move.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.342
You're gonna be okay.

40:15.714 --> 40:18.014
Here you go.
There you go.

40:18.016 --> 40:21.418
Here you go.
Here you go.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.986
Yeah. Yeah.

40:22.988 --> 40:26.322
Beverly,
Beverly called me Death.

40:29.361 --> 40:32.028
She died from my seed.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.536
No. No, no, no, no, no.

40:39.538 --> 40:43.339
Please don't hurt
yourself again. Please.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.809
Do you have a picture
of Beverly?

40:45.811 --> 40:47.410
I hear she was very beautiful.

40:47.412 --> 40:51.414
She was so beautiful.
I have a picture in my box.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.417
[instrumental music]

41:06.832 --> 41:09.833
<i> Aw, yeah, she is beautiful.</i>

41:17.042 --> 41:19.509
Becky, what are you doing here?

41:21.947 --> 41:24.414
- Ah, I'm sorry. I..
- For what?

41:24.416 --> 41:28.184
I was out with friends
and -- and I couldn't sleep.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.919
- What is this?
- Um..

41:29.921 --> 41:31.754
Just some scribbles

41:31.756 --> 41:33.056
trying to make sense
of our sessions.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.991
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.462
[Stone sighs]

41:42.734 --> 41:45.368
It's good. Yeah.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.570
You're starting to get
a sense of paranoids.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.005
They need the space.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.708
"The perimeter of safety"
is how you described it.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.877
That's what I said.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.048
- Dr. Stone.
- Yup?

41:59.050 --> 42:01.317
You mentioned
that you had taken LSD.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.022
How did it help you to
understand your patients better?

42:07.626 --> 42:10.793
I lost the sense of my own
physical boundaries

42:10.795 --> 42:11.828
depersonalization.

42:11.830 --> 42:14.697
I -- I -- I hallucinated

42:14.699 --> 42:16.299
like they do, I think.

42:18.436 --> 42:20.103
Should I try it?

42:20.105 --> 42:23.139
Would it help me understand them
better also?

42:23.141 --> 42:27.610
<i> No. Unless I'm there</i>
<i> to watch over you.</i>

42:29.814 --> 42:32.882
Is everybody happy?

42:32.884 --> 42:34.918
- Yes!
- Yes!

42:34.920 --> 42:37.487
- You need some sleep.
- Yeah.

42:37.489 --> 42:42.358
I'll just get a shower.
Alright, let's see.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.561
Shirley, did you get
your lunch together?

42:44.563 --> 42:48.398
- I'm not Shirley.
- I'm Shirley.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.266
Wait a minute, are you sure
you're Shirley and not Molly?

42:50.268 --> 42:53.403
- Yes, dad.
- Are you, are you sure
that you're not Shirley?

42:53.405 --> 42:56.005
- You're silly.
- No. And you're Molly.

42:56.007 --> 43:01.411
- I am not.
- If -- if I changed your name,
are you still Shirley?

43:01.413 --> 43:05.315
- Of course, Daddy.
- I know why you did that.

43:06.618 --> 43:07.984
Why?

43:07.986 --> 43:09.652
It's to teach Shirley
to not be hurt

43:09.654 --> 43:11.020
by the names from the boys.

43:11.022 --> 43:14.424
Mmm! Smarty pants!

43:14.426 --> 43:16.326
I got two smarty pants' here.

43:16.328 --> 43:20.763
I can't believe it.
Wow, you are so smart.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.298
<i> Okay, get your coats on.</i>

43:25.236 --> 43:28.271
Why won't Dr. Orbus respond
to my manly letters?

43:28.273 --> 43:31.341
- I don't know.
- Are my words offensive?

43:31.343 --> 43:34.110
Be careful what you say
or Shocky Boy will light you up.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.479
- Did he light up Benson?
- No. No, he did not.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.247
No, Clyde is feeling
much better now.

43:38.249 --> 43:39.549
Can't the doctor
from near heaven

43:39.551 --> 43:41.951
urge the highest Dr. Orbus
to hear me out?

43:41.953 --> 43:43.486
How else will I return
to England?

43:43.488 --> 43:44.721
I'll rot in here.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.991
I'll urge him
to read your letters, okay?

43:47.993 --> 43:51.194
[instrumental music]

44:01.940 --> 44:04.240
My eternal gratitude, my son.

44:10.615 --> 44:12.081
Oh.

44:14.285 --> 44:17.754
Words cannot convey
what notes can say.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.055
Much obliged.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.090
<i> Hinkley news flash</i>

44:21.092 --> 44:23.459
the doctor was saved from stench

44:23.461 --> 44:26.929
by your humble reporter.
He was most kindly.

44:26.931 --> 44:28.831
<i> Good to have you back, Clyde.</i>

44:28.833 --> 44:30.333
Alright.

44:30.335 --> 44:35.271
Gentlemen...this...is now

44:35.273 --> 44:36.939
the chairman's chair.

44:36.941 --> 44:41.744
From now on, I want one of you
to lead each of the meetings

44:41.746 --> 44:43.246
and starting with a song.

44:43.248 --> 44:44.847
Give it to me, I'll take it.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.249
You know, that's a good idea,
but I think we should

44:46.251 --> 44:48.651
have a vote
for the first chairman.

44:48.653 --> 44:49.786
Truth is a chairman.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.821
I nominate Ms. Anderson.

44:51.823 --> 44:54.357
- She's a woman.
- I can attest.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.545
I nominate Joseph,
on Joseph's request.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.213
All favor.

45:20.051 --> 45:23.252
[instrumental music]

45:29.828 --> 45:31.027
Unanimous.

45:31.029 --> 45:32.628
Congratulations.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.433
Chairman Joseph.

45:39.471 --> 45:40.636
<i> Please.</i>

45:40.638 --> 45:42.638
[instrumental music]

45:54.018 --> 45:55.318
Good.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.786
Now let's start with a song.

45:56.788 --> 45:59.355
Why don't we do that,
"America the Beautiful."

46:00.658 --> 46:02.091
An English melody.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.894
No, it isn't.
And it isn't opera.

46:06.698 --> 46:10.433
Uh, this type is too small
for Jesus. I..

46:11.035 --> 46:12.635
Oh.

46:20.945 --> 46:25.448
¶ Oh beautiful ¶

46:25.450 --> 46:30.186
¶ For spacious skies ¶

46:30.188 --> 46:36.359
¶ For amber waves of grain ¶

46:37.729 --> 46:40.930
¶ For purple ¶

46:40.932 --> 46:45.234
¶ Mountain majesty ¶

46:45.236 --> 46:51.607
¶ Above the fruited plain ¶

46:52.911 --> 46:56.879
¶ America ¶

46:56.881 --> 47:00.616
¶ America ¶

47:00.618 --> 47:05.788
¶ God shed his grace on thee ¶

47:07.358 --> 47:11.093
¶ And crown thy good ¶

47:11.095 --> 47:14.664
¶ With brotherhood ¶

47:14.666 --> 47:21.838
¶ From sea to shining sea ¶¶

47:24.509 --> 47:25.708
Yeah.

47:27.612 --> 47:30.479
Joseph's been writing to you
for months now.

47:30.481 --> 47:32.014
Can you respond to his letters?

47:32.016 --> 47:34.517
I don't have time.
And I wouldn't know what to say.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.052
But he wants access to you

47:36.054 --> 47:39.222
you're the most important
authority figure here.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.991
Look, I promised him
that you would respond.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.392
Did you?

47:44.362 --> 47:45.895
Well, that's a pickle.

47:48.933 --> 47:52.602
Look, they're starting
the meeting without prompting.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.807
Oh, the LSD's starting to work.

47:59.444 --> 48:01.911
It's a small dose, the effects
will wear off quickly.

48:03.715 --> 48:07.583
¶ Onward Christian soldiers ¶

48:07.585 --> 48:11.387
¶ Marching as to war ¶

48:11.389 --> 48:14.824
¶ With the cross of Jesus ¶

48:14.826 --> 48:16.325
Leon, why are you here?

48:18.396 --> 48:22.965
It's me, Becky.
Leon is in there.

48:24.269 --> 48:26.469
[indistinct chatter]

48:30.909 --> 48:33.943
That's your voice,
but not your body.

48:33.945 --> 48:35.411
It's me. It's me.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.647
Use your instincts.

48:37.649 --> 48:38.781
It's me.

48:40.084 --> 48:43.019
I'm right here. Okay?

48:43.021 --> 48:44.587
I believe it's you.

48:50.795 --> 48:53.362
I can't tell where you end
and I begin.

48:53.364 --> 48:54.964
You're okay, you're fine.

49:01.039 --> 49:03.105
Oh, hi, honey.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.708
- Hi.
- I'm Ruth.

49:05.710 --> 49:07.810
This is my assistant, Becky.

49:07.812 --> 49:09.545
[Becky vomits]

49:22.293 --> 49:24.627
Thank you, nurse.

49:24.629 --> 49:29.265
Becky, you know,
when we first met, uh

49:29.267 --> 49:31.767
I asked you about
your family issues

49:31.769 --> 49:34.470
and you preferred not to speak
about them. Drink this.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.440
Some coffee, you'll feel better.

49:37.442 --> 49:40.376
Nothing you say
will change my opinion of you.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.549
Do you have mental illness
in your family?

49:48.486 --> 49:50.920
Yes. My brother.

49:52.290 --> 49:54.023
<i> It spiraled out of control?</i>

49:56.227 --> 49:57.526
Yes.

49:57.528 --> 49:59.528
Did he take his life?

50:02.200 --> 50:03.599
He did.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.603
And that's why you wanna do
this kind of work?

50:07.605 --> 50:09.538
-<i> To help people, as you say?</i>
- Yes.

50:09.540 --> 50:12.441
Yeah. That's good.
That's a real good thing.

50:14.112 --> 50:18.414
You know, because...because I
didn't help him or my mom

50:18.416 --> 50:20.082
and everything fell apart.

50:21.419 --> 50:24.854
I'm so sorry about your brother.

50:24.856 --> 50:28.424
But you can't live for someone
who doesn't want to

50:28.426 --> 50:30.493
or prevent them
from taking their lives.

50:30.495 --> 50:33.295
<i> And you can't blame yourself</i>
<i> for surviving.</i>

50:33.297 --> 50:35.898
I know this from experience.

50:37.335 --> 50:39.702
<i> The yeti tribe</i>
<i> is believed to live</i>

50:39.704 --> 50:41.537
<i> in the Himalayan mountains.</i>

50:41.539 --> 50:43.139
<i> It's a matriarchal society</i>

50:43.141 --> 50:46.008
<i> where the yeti woman</i>
<i> is worshipped as a goddess.</i>

50:46.010 --> 50:48.411
<i> No one's actually seen</i>
<i> the yetis</i>

50:48.413 --> 50:49.945
<i> but their footprints</i>
<i> have been found</i>

50:49.947 --> 50:53.115
<i> on a number of expeditions</i>
<i> to Mount Everest.</i>

50:53.117 --> 50:56.752
<i> The female yeti or Madame Yeti</i>

50:56.754 --> 50:59.488
<i> is said to possess</i>
<i> extraordinary strength.</i>

50:59.490 --> 51:03.192
<i> And is able to lift animals</i>
<i> weighing hundreds of pounds.</i>

51:03.194 --> 51:06.395
[instrumental music]

51:16.874 --> 51:18.908
- Well, it's new, right?
- Mm-hmm.

51:18.910 --> 51:21.644
Maybe a breakthrough.
Progress, for sure.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.012
Is that why
you wanted to see me?

51:23.014 --> 51:24.780
Yes. Absolutely.

51:26.184 --> 51:30.186
You know, Joseph has been
writing letters to Dr. Orbus

51:30.188 --> 51:32.254
who hasn't responded.

51:32.256 --> 51:34.790
That's customary.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.993
What if I respond as Dr. Orbus?

51:38.896 --> 51:41.564
Really?
Why would you do that?

51:41.566 --> 51:42.998
Because they're hurt and angry.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.468
No one responds
to their letters.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.069
Mm.

51:47.071 --> 51:49.371
You know, I could even give them
some suggestions

51:49.373 --> 51:52.208
that might modify
their behavior.

51:52.210 --> 51:53.542
I don't understand.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.044
Why are you moving away
from identity study?

51:55.046 --> 51:58.013
This is a radical,
untried approach.

51:58.015 --> 52:00.616
These patients have been
responsive to suggestions.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.618
Why don't we just go with that,
and push it further?

52:02.620 --> 52:04.186
Alan, you're asking my approval

52:04.188 --> 52:07.490
to get directly involved
in their delusional systems.

52:07.492 --> 52:09.859
You promised me
not to cross the boundaries

52:09.861 --> 52:12.728
of normal clinical protocol.

52:12.730 --> 52:16.765
Jonas Salk
infected patients with viruses

52:16.767 --> 52:18.701
to test the polio vaccine,
right here.

52:18.703 --> 52:20.669
- In Ypisilanti in the '40s.
- That's correct. Yes.

52:20.671 --> 52:24.907
Very risky.
Madame Curie, the same thing,
who worked with -- with x-rays.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.842
No risk, no -- no breakthroughs.

52:26.844 --> 52:30.179
And if you do that, you'd force
me to cut off your funding.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.384
When's the next board meeting?

52:35.386 --> 52:37.720
<i>Dr. Abrams arrives in the fall.</i>

52:41.492 --> 52:44.560
Might be wise to get her opinion

52:44.562 --> 52:47.630
the recognized expert
in this field.

52:53.738 --> 52:58.073
Alan...I'm disappointed in you.

52:59.143 --> 53:02.144
[instrumental music]

53:09.320 --> 53:10.953
<i> Leon, you have a visitor.</i>

53:23.134 --> 53:24.266
<i> That's my mother.</i>

53:38.583 --> 53:40.282
Why are you mad at me?

53:42.453 --> 53:43.786
Why are you mad at me?

53:43.788 --> 53:45.688
Mrs. Gabor, please.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.823
<i> What have I done?</i>

53:52.029 --> 53:53.462
<i> I'm all alone.</i>

53:53.464 --> 53:55.731
<i> Mrs. Gabor, calm down.</i>
<i> Please.</i>

53:55.733 --> 53:57.633
Alone, do you hear?

53:57.635 --> 53:58.968
Mrs. Gabor.

54:00.605 --> 54:03.472
<i> What I have done to you?</i>

54:03.474 --> 54:06.675
[instrumental music]

54:19.223 --> 54:22.191
No! No! No!

54:22.193 --> 54:23.659
I was called
to attend a patient.

54:23.661 --> 54:25.027
I'll treat him.
I'll treat him.

54:25.029 --> 54:26.829
Shocky Boy, Shocky Boy,
Shocky Boy.

54:26.831 --> 54:29.365
He's agitated, incoherent,
and needs to be controlled.

54:29.367 --> 54:30.633
I said I will treat the patient.

54:30.635 --> 54:32.868
<i> ...what is and not a sin</i>

54:35.339 --> 54:39.408
<i> and the, things</i>
<i> of the [mumbling]</i>

54:39.410 --> 54:40.809
<i>all the different ways in which</i>

54:40.811 --> 54:42.311
<i>[mumbling] which God would look</i>

54:42.313 --> 54:45.114
<i> [mumbling]</i>

54:45.116 --> 54:47.650
<i> ...seen through the eyes</i>
<i> of the devil.</i>

54:47.652 --> 54:49.685
Leon.

54:49.687 --> 54:51.920
If you can calm yourself..

54:53.524 --> 54:55.758
...I can take the straps off.

54:58.929 --> 55:00.296
Madame..

55:02.600 --> 55:04.166
<i> Madame Yeti.</i>

55:04.168 --> 55:06.201
Who's Madame Yeti?

55:06.203 --> 55:07.236
My wife.

55:07.238 --> 55:08.470
You told me
that you were married

55:08.472 --> 55:09.838
to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.742
No. No, no. Madame Yeti.

55:13.744 --> 55:16.712
Or Madame R.I. Dung.

55:16.714 --> 55:19.014
You can see her
on Channel One.

55:19.016 --> 55:23.552
She said that I was
a pile of truthful idle dung.

55:23.554 --> 55:25.788
<i> Doctor,</i>
<i> Dr. Righteous Idle Dung</i>

55:25.790 --> 55:28.123
<i> and I -- I accepted.</i>

55:29.827 --> 55:32.161
It is comical
to a certain degree.

55:32.163 --> 55:33.729
What kind of doctor is he,
you might ask?

55:33.731 --> 55:35.998
- A doctor of shit.
- A doctor of shit.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.867
<i> You can call me Rex, or Dung</i>

55:38.869 --> 55:43.072
Doctor -- doctor,
Dr. Shit or, or Dr. Dung.

55:45.543 --> 55:47.576
Mm-hmm.

55:47.578 --> 55:49.945
Mm. I like it.

55:52.616 --> 55:53.782
<i> What, you don't?</i>

55:53.784 --> 55:55.284
Well, the purpose
is for Leon

55:55.286 --> 55:56.985
to give up his Christ delusion,
correct?

55:56.987 --> 55:58.287
Yes.

55:58.289 --> 56:00.856
I think you shouldn't write
to Leon as Dr. Orbus.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.458
It's too late for that,
I'm not going to discuss --

56:02.460 --> 56:05.361
I think it should be
written as Madame Yeti.

56:05.363 --> 56:07.663
Isn't Leon more likely
to follow a suggestion

56:07.665 --> 56:10.866
from a woman, his wife,
than a man?

56:10.868 --> 56:14.169
This -- this is what I came up
with.

56:18.042 --> 56:21.543
"My dear husband,
I have been aware on Channel One

56:21.545 --> 56:22.978
"that you have been watching me.

56:22.980 --> 56:25.948
"And now, what a nice letter
you've sent me.

56:25.950 --> 56:29.051
"I will meet you tomorrow
at 5 o'clock at the lake

56:29.053 --> 56:33.722
if it pleases you.
Fondly, Madame Yeti Woman."

56:37.361 --> 56:40.462
It's good.
No, it's better than good.

56:40.464 --> 56:42.431
This is really spot on.

56:42.433 --> 56:44.166
Uh, now, Joseph and Clyde.

56:44.168 --> 56:46.368
You should write as Dr. Orbus.

56:52.009 --> 56:55.411
I was killed last night
and got another body.

56:56.881 --> 56:59.114
You look the same to me.

56:59.116 --> 57:00.716
Pertaining to the internal
construction

57:00.718 --> 57:02.117
it is different.

57:07.625 --> 57:09.057
I don't see it.

57:09.059 --> 57:11.226
Mr. Cassel, do not put the penis
in the wrong hole

57:11.228 --> 57:13.796
or else you'll wind up
a disfigured midget.

57:16.066 --> 57:19.568
- No offense.
- None taken, but there's
Ms. Anderson to consider.

57:19.570 --> 57:21.537
She's here. I can attest.

57:24.575 --> 57:27.376
If I have hurt your feelings
through rude expression

57:27.378 --> 57:29.278
it was due to using a word
that Mr. Cassel

57:29.280 --> 57:32.648
can more readily understand
and strike at.

57:32.650 --> 57:35.551
Please forgive the expression..

57:35.553 --> 57:37.786
...and the messenger.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.588
My feelings aren't hurt.

57:39.590 --> 57:43.091
No tears. I can attest.

57:43.093 --> 57:44.993
Who's leading today?

57:46.797 --> 57:50.933
Mr. Benson,
you wanna start us off?

57:51.836 --> 57:53.168
<i> No.</i>

57:55.406 --> 57:56.905
No, I will not.

57:58.476 --> 57:59.575
Okay.

58:01.879 --> 58:03.412
<i> Okay.</i>

58:06.550 --> 58:08.383
Okie doke.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.254
Ah, that's better.

58:13.958 --> 58:15.958
That's very considerate, Leon.

58:18.028 --> 58:21.530
<i> Three Christ's session,</i>
<i> September 10th, 1960.</i>

58:22.800 --> 58:24.433
- Mr. Chairman.
- Sure.

58:24.435 --> 58:27.536
May I offer Dr. Orbus' response
to your letters?

58:27.538 --> 58:29.071
No.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.306
No, you may not.

58:36.413 --> 58:40.582
Thank you, good doctor, for
calling this most special
meeting.

58:44.388 --> 58:46.388
[indistinct chatter]

58:48.959 --> 58:50.592
Madame Yeti.

58:56.333 --> 58:57.466
[mumbling]

58:59.270 --> 59:01.169
Mr. Benson,
would you please refrain

59:01.171 --> 59:03.405
from hawking merchandise?

59:05.376 --> 59:08.043
Psychology used to
agitate his negative.

59:12.016 --> 59:16.818
Do you have a, a time piece
that might be borrowed?

59:16.820 --> 59:18.854
Sure, of course.

59:18.856 --> 59:21.623
Clyde, if you can refrain from
showering more than once a day

59:21.625 --> 59:24.059
I will be willing to discuss
your request

59:24.061 --> 59:27.663
to work in the laundry
rather than the kitchen.

59:27.665 --> 59:29.531
<i> Sincerely yours, Dr. Orbus.</i>

59:29.533 --> 59:31.833
Icily light

59:31.835 --> 59:34.102
sensibly right

59:34.104 --> 59:37.306
crystal clear.

59:37.308 --> 59:39.641
Crisp refresher.

59:42.846 --> 59:46.748
Sir, it's 6:00 p.m. and Leon
hasn't showed up at the lake.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.183
Where is he?

59:48.185 --> 59:50.152
He's in the bathroom
masturbating again.

59:51.689 --> 59:54.823
Do you think Joseph and Clyde
would be more suggestible?

59:54.825 --> 59:56.592
I sure hope so.

59:59.063 --> 01:00:03.231
Ballantine, Ballantine, beer.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:08.503
"As you know, Joseph,
I don't share your beliefs

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:11.173
"that our institution
is an English stronghold.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:14.343
<i> "If you can visit the Chapel,</i>
<i> maybe yourself</i>

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:17.079
<i> "with the teachings</i>
<i> of the church more directly.</i>

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:19.147
<i> Yours truly, Dr. Orbus."</i>

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.357
And you've been sending copies
of all these letters

01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:30.225
to Dr. Orbus and Dr. Rogers?

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:31.593
Yes.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.462
What have you been writing up
for Leon?

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:36.231
Uh, I told him that Madame Yeti
was disappointed

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:38.166
but would give him
one more chance to meet

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.935
by the lake at 5:30 tomorrow.

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:42.137
<i> That's good, I like it.</i>

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:03.125
"Dear Dr. Orbus, I do believe
showering three times a day

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:06.528
"will lead to a diminishment
of the sewer gas

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.096
"to which I am prone.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:11.667
"Farts, sir, are a questionable
fact of life

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:13.669
"but stinking is vile.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.737
Christ, not of Nazareth."

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.178
What?

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.379
I'm impressed.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.715
That I've abstained
from the shower?

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:29.384
Has my stench returned?

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.752
No.

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.838
What do you think?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.440
Maybe.

01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:01.383
"Dr. Orbus, a man must have
a hard-on

"back to my native country
of England.

Yours truly, Joseph Cassel."

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:16.932
I do not share your belief
that our institution

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:18.366
is an English stronghold

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:23.004
nor that you are a citizen
of England.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:25.607
<i> Bill, the Christ's are being</i>
<i> responsive to my suggestions.</i>

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:28.176
<i> If this continues, this could</i>
<i> be a real breakthrough</i>

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.344
<i> especially with Leon.</i>

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.979
<i> So please, hold off on doing</i>

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.114
<i> anything till the meeting</i>

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.515
<i> with Dr. Abrams.</i>

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:35.117
- Okay, to Joseph.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:38.153
Uh, perhaps you can persuade
Leon and Clyde

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.454
to join you in your church

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:42.457
and share what you have been
learning.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:54.269
Gentlemen, my body shall be
at the chapel shortly alone.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.539
It would give me a supreme
sensation of good fortune

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:02.043
if you fellows, whose corpus are
here, were to join me.

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:04.346
You wouldn't be alone then.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.054
[door opens]

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:16.258
[instrumental music]

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:31.273
Dr. Stone. Leon is a no-show.

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.776
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:37.512
<i> What do you think,</i>
<i> third time a charm?</i>

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.114
[sighs]

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.699
Yup.

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:01.570
Leon has been waiting
at the lake since 3:30 p.m..

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.206
Punctual.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:21.590
<i> Madame Yeti.</i>

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.393
Ma -- ma -- madame.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:35.403
[door opens]

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:39.074
Ah, Dr. Stone.
Please, have a seat.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:42.544
Thank you.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:45.247
Read that, if you wouldn't
mind, please.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:51.353
What do you think?

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:54.322
Why are you responding
to Joseph's letter?

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:58.226
I could say
because he's writing to me.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.896
But you've never done it before.

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:05.533
I am wondering if I should be
more involved going forward.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.602
I did quite a bit of research
in my early days.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:10.639
Some of it very
forward-thinking.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:14.776
We could work even closer
together, as partners.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.851
Congratulations.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:27.122
Yeah.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:28.623
So..

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.761
...what do you think
of my letter to Joseph?

01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:38.133
I think it's ill-advised
at this moment.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:42.070
It's not consistent
with the voice I've been using.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.406
As me.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.975
Yes. As you.

01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:52.347
The more you include me,
the more you involve me

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.349
the better equipped I'll be to

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:57.352
stop Dr. Rogers
from shutting you down.

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:02.891
[door opens]

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.095
Leon. Wanna chair
the meeting today?

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.130
Everyone in favor, vote aye.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.433
- Nay.
- Aye, aye, aye.

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.735
Unanimous, congratulations.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:21.643
¶ Oh say can you see.. ¶¶

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.512
So it says
in the introduction here

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:28.583
there's ridicule
against my reincarnation.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:31.820
"Three mental patients
each claiming to be

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:34.122
Jesus Christ have been
brought together --"

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:37.459
<i> "Today one-one subject has</i>
<i> changed his belief</i>

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:39.961
"about being Christ
and has taken on another

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.596
another false identity,
and this patient --"

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:44.866
<i> "This patient claims the other</i>
<i> two are subject</i>

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:48.803
"to electronic interference
and..

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:53.241
"...the third patient thinks
the other two are crazy."

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.910
They are in a mental hospital.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:01.016
Sir, there-there appears to be

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:03.485
indirect warped psychology here.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:05.253
My name,
Dr. Righteous-Idealed Dung

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.489
it's-it's not-it's not,
it's not here.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.624
Yeah, well,
your names were withheld

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.459
to protect your privacy.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:13.695
Well, I wish they had been
included.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.330
Because it would have changed
the entire picture

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.398
pertaining to my manliness.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.966
[door opens]

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:23.805
I think you all know Dr. Orbus.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:29.611
Continue, please. What was it
you were talking about?

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.747
They were just giving their
opinions of the article.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:34.983
And what a wonderful article
it is.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.886
Carry on.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.527
Anyone?

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:51.966
Well, I just meant to drop off
the letters.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.402
I will say how much I am
enjoying our correspondence

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:59.374
and terrific progress
being made.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.076
Thank you, doctor.

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:07.916
My letters.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:10.652
No, we'll pass them out
tomorrow. That's fine.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:12.520
Tomorrow we'll do that.

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:19.194
I wish to speak
to God Morphey Anderson

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.162
<i> alone</i>

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:24.631
by myself, with a pipe organ.

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:30.572
Three men who think they're
Jesus borders on the comical.

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:46.421
Thanks for coming over.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:48.089
It's really helpful
for my meeting

01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:49.591
with Dr. Abrams.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:52.359
Uh, we need to do that rewrite
for Orbus this time.

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:54.194
Um, I already did.

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.500
Okay.

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:04.538
Oh, you started the party
without me.

01:09:06.076 --> 01:09:09.911
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just some fun with the girls.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.246
Hi, Becky.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.515
Hi, Mrs. Stone.

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:18.786
- I'll get some coffee.
- That would be divine.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:24.091
Alan is a prince. You know that.

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:26.227
I -- I really should go.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.962
He wasn't born one.

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:29.631
You should know the man
and not the myth

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:31.099
although
they're largely the same.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.067
Come. Sit.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:49.450
His mother drove him to excel
at school, to become a doctor.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:53.020
But not just any doctor,
a great one.

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:56.724
She saved every penny she had
to send him

01:09:56.726 --> 01:09:59.160
from Berlin to London.

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:02.664
Kid, with no money in a country

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.332
on the verge of war
with his homeland

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:07.235
and he, speaking in a very
conspicuous German accent.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.437
It wasn't very pretty.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:12.674
But he moved to Brooklyn.
And then the war broke out.

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:15.977
He enlisted in the Army,
served in the front lines

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.746
in Europe and then later
in Korea.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:22.283
He came back different.

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:26.554
He never spoke about it,
not a word.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:35.496
After the war, I was his

01:10:35.498 --> 01:10:39.434
young research assistant
at Michigan State.

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:45.073
Those days that became nights,
that became mornings.

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:49.777
It was intoxicating

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:53.014
intimate, erotic.

01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:59.187
[water boiling]

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.341
<i> I just had a drink.</i>

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:23.011
Actually, quite a few.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:25.313
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:34.222
This must stop.
No more drinking, alright?

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:38.126
I will do anything for you,
for the kids

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:40.328
but this will end, now!

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:47.635
<i>Your article's attracting quite</i>
<i> a bit of attention, and ink.</i>

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.104
<i> Predominantly negative,</i>
<i> Dr. Abrams.</i>

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:55.610
Bill, I wanted to meet the mind
that dreamt this experiment up.

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.111
I'm honored.

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:59.414
You are writing letters
as someone

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:00.948
other than yourself to patients.

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:03.151
- Yes.
- Bill, you're not on board
with this?

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.118
That's correct.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.987
And yet there is objective
evidence

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.522
that there is progress
being made

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:09.824
with your patients
in many areas.

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.994
Bill?

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.495
Doctor, I -- I'm really
exploring new territory --

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.664
I know what you're doing

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.733
and I probably know why
you're doing it.

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:21.402
What's your greatest anxiety?

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:23.538
[sighs]

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:26.007
That we, as a profession
warehouse

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:29.010
drug and restrain patients
rather than treat them.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.146
I don't think it's good enough,
not by a long shot.

01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:33.047
Do you?

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:34.882
You're telling me and the entire

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:38.052
psychiatric hierarchy
to go fuck itself.

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:42.090
I like that.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:52.834
Dr. Stone has agreed to let us
talk alone.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.406
Well, I must admit, madame,
that the beaming smile

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:01.642
on your face is something that
I haven't

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:05.413
quite experienced before
in my life.

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:07.382
That's very kind of you.

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:10.385
What did you want to talk about?

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:13.321
I share Dr. Rogers' concern

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.858
about what your involvement with
the Christ delusional systems

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.893
is doing to them, to you

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.062
your judgment
and your conclusions.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:24.999
The work I'm doing with the four
Christ's is really si..

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:28.002
<i> Three Christ's,</i>
<i> the work I'm doing with</i>

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:31.139
the three Christ's is singular.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.540
Four.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.674
I -- I meant three.

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:36.244
I know what you meant. Do you?

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.282
Yes.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.820
Things are getting blurry.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:52.193
You have a look of a man
on a journey, a descent.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:14:00.168
Did you, when you were doing
your most demanding work?

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:04.505
Yes.

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:10.178
There's a poem
by Emily Dickinson.

01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:13.748
But Let A Splinter Swerve.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:17.018
It's about the power
of an original idea

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.220
<i> how it can move mountains</i>

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:22.356
<i> and leave a debris field</i>
<i> in its wake.</i>

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:29.964
Your work is novel,
brilliant and dangerous.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:34.035
You decide if the gains outweigh
the obvious risks.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:40.908
<i> Don't you want to leave Ypsi</i>
<i> and resume your life outside?</i>

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.678
If you can use your given name,
control yourself

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.379
this could happen.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.836
I won't, I won't touch it

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.339
no matter how close it comes.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:16.077
I've thought of you nightly.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:20.348
Making emissions into your
squelch chamber pleasantly.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.083
And you me?

01:15:24.587 --> 01:15:29.056
Leon, there are boundaries
that must be observed.

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:34.095
Yes, there are boundaries.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.698
<i> In Europe, during the war</i>

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.967
duping caused me to degenerate

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.937
with a couple of soldiers
in a clubhouse.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:46.007
And while I was kneeling

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:49.477
I noticed this boy's feet.

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:51.879
They were enormous
compared to mine.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:56.450
He did it to me twice.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:04.659
I was so frightened that I ran
out of there screaming

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:07.428
with my hair standing on end.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.875
You know this feeling. How?

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.178
Did it happen to you? Rape?

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:29.450
You don't have to say.
God knows all.

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.487
But you can't lie, can you?

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:37.525
I don't lie.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:45.232
You are full of truth.

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:48.903
Full of what makes
the desert bloom.

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:52.406
And I, humbly, sad that I am,
will do my best

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:56.177
to honor your sadness with what
little I have to offer.

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:02.249
Pipe organs can help if you need
to shake it off.

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:11.125
I should have kept my distance.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.628
I crossed a boundary,
didn't I?

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:16.163
Yes.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:20.568
But sometimes we have to follow
our instincts.

01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.571
[instrumental music]

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:28.809
Dr. Abrams left it up to me
to decide

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.412
whether to continue or not.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:34.982
I'll carry on.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:39.120
Will you? Can you?

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:42.089
I will.

01:17:43.593 --> 01:17:48.062
There is one thing
I would like to do for Leon.

Please, have a seat.

Sorry, should I address you

If you must, but that's just
between us, please.

Because I am the righteous one.

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.656
Very good.
I've got great news.

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:06.427
Dr. Stone has encouraged me
to be more involved with you

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:08.996
because of the progress
you've made.

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:11.432
You are going to tell me that
I am free to leave

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:14.668
the hospital today.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.136
Why don't we start
by you telling me

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.405
a little bit about yourself?

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:22.543
Have I done what you've
requested in your letters?

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:23.744
Well..

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:27.882
Have I done what you've
requested?

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:31.352
I -- I suppose you have done
as we've requested.

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:36.557
In your letters you said I'd be
free to go to England.

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:40.227
Can I now?

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.665
Uh, no, you can't now.

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:50.337
In your letters you said I would
be free to go if you would --

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:53.307
Actually, I allowed Dr. Stone
to answer for me in those
letters

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:56.644
because he was working
so closely with you.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.852
You asked Dr. Stone
to lie to me for you?

01:22:04.854 --> 01:22:06.186
Allow me to clarify.

01:22:06.188 --> 01:22:07.755

than you have now

01:22:09.926 --> 01:22:14.028

your release.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:18.065
Well, now, how -- how

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:21.602
how can I, anyone know

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:23.971
when you are lying
and when you are not?

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:25.439
I'm telling you the truth.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.174
So you won't unchain me.

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:31.011
I can't now, but I could.

01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:35.382
Why do you twist the truth with
me, Dr. Orbus? Did I lie to you?

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.084
This is a very serious decision
you're asking --

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.652
Do I lie to you?

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:40.321
A serious man can only take

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:42.423
so much before he shatters.
Please.

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:44.124
Okay. Please,
if you'll just sit down --

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:45.993
Let me go. Let me go!

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:49.363
You must now
or everything will fall apart.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.598
The center will not hold.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.566
Orderlies!

01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:54.835
You do not know what's happening

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:57.638
because you are murdering
my mind.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.774
-<i> Call Dr. Francisco!</i>
- No!

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:03.777
[dramatic music]

01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:22.496
<i> Dr. Stone.</i>

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:26.500
[muffled screaming]

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:30.871
No. No. I'm stopping this.
No more.

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:33.240
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- You are not authorized.

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:35.576
You are not authorized
to do this!

01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:37.011
[groans]

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:39.046
Stop!

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:40.748
[groans]

01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:47.888
Clear!

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:49.690
[electricity buzzing]

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.481
[gasps]

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:18.585
Hey.

01:24:21.424 --> 01:24:23.223
How's Joseph?

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.993
Um, he's still heavily sedated.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.767
[instrumental music]

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:45.879
Are you making fun of me?

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:51.885
No, I'm -- I'm,
I had a concussion.

01:24:51.887 --> 01:24:55.022
You're dressing
like a mental patient.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:56.123
Yeah.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.125
Who are you?

01:24:58.127 --> 01:25:01.128
You're not Dr. Stone,
you changed your name.

01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:05.933
Why?

01:25:05.935 --> 01:25:07.734
To avoid being judged.

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:10.070
Your fake name judges you.

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:16.710
You couldn't protect Joseph.

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:18.412
What makes you think
you'll protect me?

01:25:18.414 --> 01:25:20.948
No one is going to shock you.

01:25:22.852 --> 01:25:25.686
A gowned patient can't
protect anyone.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.093
<i> Dr. Stone,</i>
<i> how are you feeling?</i>

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:34.461
Just peachy keen.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:35.596
Perhaps you should go back
to your room

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:37.998
and convalesce in comfort.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.200
You're interested
in my well-being?

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:41.802
- Yes.
- Why?

01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:45.105
There's pressure on me
to remove you from the hospital.

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:46.640
Me?

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.176
You interfered with an
authorized medical procedure..

01:25:49.178 --> 01:25:52.980
I didn't authorize anything.
Not by me. No.

01:25:52.982 --> 01:25:55.149
Patient Cassel assaulted me.
He was out of control.

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:56.383
He had no business being there.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:57.885
What were you doing there,
anyway?

01:25:57.887 --> 01:25:59.153
Assisting you.

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.954
If I need your help,
I'll let you know.

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:03.657
Dr. Stone, this afternoon
was an unfortunate incident

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.759
I'm offering you
an olive branch.

01:26:10.466 --> 01:26:11.999
[door closes]

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:17.204
Oh!

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:19.940
Oh, I'm fine.

01:26:24.446 --> 01:26:27.214
<i> My music.</i>

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:29.716
Could you play my music?

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.291
The devil tortured me.

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:40.460
And he said you were Judas.

01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:42.796
You wrote the letters?

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:48.335
- Yes. I wrote the letters.
- I knew that.

01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:51.538
Why? To save me,
not to hurt me.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.341
To help you, always.

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:56.777
Your heart is pure.

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:04.117
Ooh! Listen to this aria.

01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:10.224
There are two men consumed
with love for the same woman

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:12.092
Princess Leila.

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:15.963
They swear
never to see her again

01:27:15.965 --> 01:27:20.434
and celebrate their friendship

01:27:20.436 --> 01:27:23.604
like you and Gabor
and Ms. Anderson.

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:32.946
Becky bought these.

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:35.282
She thought they'd
make you happy.

01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:41.221
Becky.

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:53.467
Can you control yourself
with Dr. Orbus?

01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:58.772
You must. You cannot give him
a reason to be punitive.

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:03.143
Three men saying
they are Christ.

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:07.914
Clyde said "So comical."

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:14.988
But now I have a new mission

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:21.662
to save you
from the devilish one.

01:28:24.099 --> 01:28:26.533
Not a comedy.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:45.218
I'm sorry, Dr. Stone? Please.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.057
What is it?

01:28:50.059 --> 01:28:53.026
I've been ordered to escort you
off hospital grounds.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.197
- Orbus?
- Yes.

01:29:00.402 --> 01:29:04.705
- Now?
- Yes. Immediately.

01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:07.307
I know how unfair this is.

01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:09.676
How wrong this is.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.087
Watch over them.

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:32.265
Joseph. I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.870
I thought I met the devil.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.173
He was an orderly in Kalamazoo.
I was wrong.

01:29:43.612 --> 01:29:44.878
I was hoping we could get
a fresh start.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.013
Would you allow me that?

01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:53.687
[instrumental music]

01:29:54.957 --> 01:29:57.190
You want me
to reinstate your privileges

01:29:57.192 --> 01:30:00.127
against Dr. Orbus' will
on your project

01:30:00.129 --> 01:30:02.162
which in my opinion
employs questionable tactics?

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:03.263
Yes!

01:30:03.265 --> 01:30:06.099
I can't do that
on a permanent basis.

01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:07.768
What can you do?

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:13.373
Let's sit and talk.

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:15.475
About what?

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:16.977
Whatever comes to mind.

01:30:16.979 --> 01:30:19.179
My mind or your mind?

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.284
In deference to Dr. Abrams,
I can hold a hearing

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:25.519
to adjudicate the matter.

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:27.621
Great. Great. That is great.

01:30:27.623 --> 01:30:31.291
Can -- can you suspend the
dismissal order against me until
the hearing?

01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:34.261
Yes. That would be the proper
course of action prior
to a judgment.

01:30:34.263 --> 01:30:36.029
Great!

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:41.935
- Who are you calling?
- Dr. Orbus.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:44.738
So you can reinstate
my privileges.

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:47.541
Where is Dr. Stone?

01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:49.910
He'll no longer be with us.

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:52.946
- Is he alive?
- Yes, of course.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.081
Well, how do I know that?
May I see him?

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:58.051
- No, not now.
- Why?

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:01.188
I'm trying to explain.
He's being replaced.

01:31:01.190 --> 01:31:02.756
By whom?

01:31:02.758 --> 01:31:04.691
By me.

01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:13.400
May we go to the bell tower?

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:17.270
I want to show you God's view.

01:31:18.407 --> 01:31:20.941
Yeah, tell him to call back
right away.

01:31:20.943 --> 01:31:22.542
Yeah. Thanks so much.

01:31:22.544 --> 01:31:24.277
Now, you stay out of trouble
till the hearing.

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:25.779
Can you do that for me?

01:31:25.781 --> 01:31:27.080
Why don't you come with me
down to..

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.415
We'll drive down there
right now.

01:31:28.417 --> 01:31:30.116
You can talk to Orbus in person

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:31.918
and then there's no
miscommunication.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.254
<i> Bill, can you do this for me,</i>
<i> please?</i>

01:31:54.643 --> 01:31:57.444
May I speak to you alone?

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:03.450
Are you afraid of me, Dr. Orbus?

01:32:03.452 --> 01:32:07.053
You, you are the most powerful
man in this institution.

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:08.822
No, I'm not afraid of you, no.

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:10.223
Can we speak confidentially?

01:32:10.225 --> 01:32:13.827
- Doctor, I um --
- Benny, I won't hurt him.

01:32:13.829 --> 01:32:16.162
Um, can we have some privacy,
Benny?

01:32:16.164 --> 01:32:18.398
- Dr. Orbus --
- I wasn't asking.

01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:21.835
[exhales]

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.741
Did you make Dr. Stone
disappear?

01:32:27.743 --> 01:32:28.975
No.

01:32:28.977 --> 01:32:31.011
No, and I -- I think

01:32:31.013 --> 01:32:34.014
with my supervising you directly

01:32:34.016 --> 01:32:37.651
you have a more experienced
doctor at your disposal.

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:39.920
Can you make me disappear?

01:32:39.922 --> 01:32:41.888
I'm not -- I'm not sure
I -- I know what you mean.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:45.025
Whenever you want,
you can run electricity

01:32:45.027 --> 01:32:47.260
through my brain,
tie me in knots

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:52.699
pour poison into my veins,
make me forget my name.

01:32:52.701 --> 01:32:56.069
And now there is no one
to protect me.

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.709
You have no arms, Dr. Orbus.
Do you know that?

01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:04.077
Benny! Benny!

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:08.014
How can you soar
when you have no arms?

01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:15.121
And to think,
I was chosen to save you.

01:33:18.293 --> 01:33:19.960
England.

01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:25.231
[instrumental music]

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:57.631
God, no! No. No!

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:04.371
Get a doctor. Get a doctor.

01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:34.267
Dr. Abrams was prophetic.

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:38.405
Let A Splinter Swerve.

01:34:42.044 --> 01:34:46.346

<i> It has grown with time.</i>

01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:10.236

<i> My loss was theirs as well.</i>

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:03.890
All this preparation.

01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:05.859
I'm gonna just tell the truth.

01:36:05.861 --> 01:36:08.495
Keep it simple, direct.

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:17.437
The following allegations
have been lodged.

01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:20.073
A man has died, that's a fact,
not an allegation.

01:36:20.075 --> 01:36:23.176
Alan, did you contravene
a direct order
that Dr. Orbus gave?

01:36:23.178 --> 01:36:24.677
He's dead. Why?

01:36:24.679 --> 01:36:27.614
Was he terrified of -- of being
shocked again?

01:36:27.616 --> 01:36:30.383
Dr. Francisco was treating
an agitated patient.

01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:34.587
According to your report, it
says that his final words were..

01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:37.390
"You have no arms.
How can you soar with no arms?

01:36:37.392 --> 01:36:43.663
"So to think that I, Joseph,
was chosen to save you.

01:36:43.665 --> 01:36:45.098
England."

01:36:46.535 --> 01:36:48.334
- What do you think that means?
- Gibberish.

01:36:48.336 --> 01:36:50.703
Why? Why are you making this
so difficult?

01:36:50.705 --> 01:36:53.473
He said something.
You didn't hear it.

01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:56.743
Our job is to interpret
and understand them.

01:36:56.745 --> 01:37:00.513
And because you were
so possessed by the excitement

01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:02.715
of having your name
in the headlines, you missed it.

01:37:02.717 --> 01:37:07.120
You missed the cue to stop him
in the moment before he jumped.

01:37:07.122 --> 01:37:09.222
What he was trying to say to you

01:37:09.224 --> 01:37:12.559
is that your spirit cannot soar

01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:15.895
and that he was chosen
to save you.

01:37:15.897 --> 01:37:21.234
He died for your sins,
Dr. Orbus, like Jesus Christ.

01:37:21.236 --> 01:37:23.303
Neologisms. Nonsense.

01:37:23.305 --> 01:37:25.305
Bill, he wanted to take over
this project.

01:37:25.307 --> 01:37:28.308
He wanted to bask in whatever
glory came out of it.

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:31.644
And because of that, he started
making terrible decisions.

01:37:31.646 --> 01:37:34.147
He told Benny that he -- he
wanted to be alone

01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:35.615
with Joseph
up in the bell tower.

01:37:35.617 --> 01:37:36.883
I don't have to listen
to this Jabberwocky.

01:37:36.885 --> 01:37:38.151
<i> No, you do not.</i>

01:37:38.153 --> 01:37:40.320
Bill, you gotta stop this
tragically

01:37:40.322 --> 01:37:42.455
insecure doctor
from overmedicating

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:44.624
any more patients, shocking --

01:37:44.626 --> 01:37:46.459
Enough!

01:37:50.098 --> 01:37:51.130
[sighs]

01:37:51.132 --> 01:37:52.365
[door opens]

01:37:55.437 --> 01:37:56.903
You want it polite or straight?

01:37:56.905 --> 01:37:59.539
- Straight.
- You're fired.

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:01.507
Your experiment is terminated.

01:38:01.509 --> 01:38:03.576
Dr. Orbus will stay
in his current position.

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:06.312
That's what the report
will read.

01:38:06.314 --> 01:38:09.983
Alice has indeed fallen down
the rabbit hole.

01:38:09.985 --> 01:38:12.585
Alice is still in terra firma.

01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:16.990
Dr. Orbus will retire
within six months.

01:38:16.992 --> 01:38:18.725
So he can maintain his dignity?

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:21.694
He has been stripped of all
decision-making authority

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:24.898
by Bill

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.901
who still believes in you.

01:38:27.903 --> 01:38:30.536
I would like to arrange
a transfer to New York

01:38:30.538 --> 01:38:33.706
for you, your family
and your patients..

01:38:33.708 --> 01:38:34.540
What?

01:38:34.542 --> 01:38:36.075
I would like you to continue

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:37.810
to explore identity issues.

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:41.414
I can think of nothing more
important.

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:45.618
I admire your empathic approach
to schizophrenics.

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:49.222
Although, any cure seems
very far away.

01:38:49.224 --> 01:38:52.358
Let me be frank with you.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.296
I now have very serious doubts
about my approach.

01:38:56.298 --> 01:39:00.833
Is manipulation in the service
of therapy proper?

01:39:00.835 --> 01:39:04.337
Is lying in any form acceptable?

01:39:04.339 --> 01:39:07.407
Is giving hope when it's
highly unlikely

01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:08.775
is -- is that justifiable?

01:39:08.777 --> 01:39:10.743
I..

01:39:10.745 --> 01:39:13.680
I, for one,
won't sit in judgment.

01:39:13.682 --> 01:39:16.749
You think your patients
will continue in New York?

01:39:16.751 --> 01:39:18.351
[instrumental music]

01:39:18.353 --> 01:39:19.419
I don't know.

01:39:19.421 --> 01:39:21.487
Why don't you ask them?

01:39:39.574 --> 01:39:40.907
[sighs]

01:39:46.715 --> 01:39:49.282
I'm asking
if you want to continue our work

01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:52.218
in New York City.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.088
If you feel that our time
together has been of value --

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:57.890
Leon, you don't wanna go back
to that crowded main ward.

01:39:57.892 --> 01:39:59.258
Come with us, please.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.461
[wind howling]

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:07.700
It's all over.
The water lake is frozen.

01:40:10.605 --> 01:40:13.940
My feet are -- are stuck
in wet cement.

01:40:13.942 --> 01:40:15.742
Wet cement. I cannot move.

01:40:15.744 --> 01:40:17.643
It's alright then.

01:40:32.093 --> 01:40:34.827
Leon, I don't want to leave you
and Clyde here alone.

01:40:34.829 --> 01:40:36.763
I won't do that.

01:40:36.765 --> 01:40:41.267
I wanna help you
and care for you.

01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:43.469
I miss Joseph too.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:47.774
My heart aches for him, okay.

01:40:54.682 --> 01:40:56.549
Alan Stein.

01:40:58.019 --> 01:40:59.819
My birth name.

01:41:01.823 --> 01:41:03.156
Alan Stein.

01:41:03.158 --> 01:41:05.591
[instrumental music]

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:07.927
My parents had a Jewish name.

01:41:11.533 --> 01:41:14.000
They were murdered by the Nazis.

01:41:15.203 --> 01:41:16.502
<i> Before they were killed</i>

01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:18.971
<i> they changed my name</i>
<i> to protect me.</i>

01:41:18.973 --> 01:41:22.008
<i> They had me smuggled</i>
<i> out of the country.</i>

01:41:30.385 --> 01:41:31.951
[sobbing]

01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:36.355
Then you will be my friend?

01:41:37.826 --> 01:41:39.992
I am your friend.

01:41:49.938 --> 01:41:52.572
[instrumental music]

01:41:52.574 --> 01:41:54.640
[laughs]

01:42:00.915 --> 01:42:05.952
By the grace of Jesus Christ,
you are saved.

01:42:07.355 --> 01:42:12.391
I, Rex, son of God

01:42:14.762 --> 01:42:16.629
baptize you

01:42:18.333 --> 01:42:21.601
Dr. Dung.

01:42:21.603 --> 01:42:23.002
[laughs]

01:42:25.406 --> 01:42:27.807
Now let's go, I'm freezing.

01:42:27.809 --> 01:42:29.775
Yeah, this way. Come. Come on.

01:42:29.777 --> 01:42:31.978
Come on, we'll go back.
We'll get warm.

01:42:37.519 --> 01:42:40.720
[operatic singing]

01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:07.613
Mr. Benson, we are going away
with our new friends

01:43:07.615 --> 01:43:09.849
God Morphey and Dr. Alan Stein

01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:14.887
formerly known as Dr. Alan
Stone, currently Dr. Dung.

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:18.925
To New York.

01:43:18.927 --> 01:43:21.861
Is it closer to England?

01:43:29.103 --> 01:43:30.636
It is.

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.576
[operatic singing]

01:43:55.163 --> 01:43:58.164
[instrumental music]

01:44:28.196 --> 01:44:31.197
[music continues]

01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:04.230
[music continues]

01:45:34.262 --> 01:45:37.263
[music continues]

01:46:07.295 --> 01:46:10.296
[music continues]

01:46:40.328 --> 01:46:43.329
[music continues]

01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:16.362
[music continues]

01:47:46.394 --> 01:47:49.395
[music continues]

01:48:19.427 --> 01:48:22.428
[music continues]
