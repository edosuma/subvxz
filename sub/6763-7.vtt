{\an3}Am I the only person
that missed this place?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.593
What, Brandon,
are you crazy, man?

02:15.677 --> 02:16.261
We only got 15 minutes
of freedom left.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.221
Enjoy yourself.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.681
{\an1}One day,
we'll all look back

02:19.764 --> 02:21.516
and wish that we could start
high school all over again.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.934
Yeah, you speak for yourself.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.687
Look, all I know is
that for the last three years,

02:25.770 --> 02:26.479
I've been working
and studying my butt off.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.065
{\an3}This year, something's
got to give.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.943
I got to have some fun.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.278
{\an3}I thought that's what
we've been doing.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.362
Mmm.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.367
{\an3}How long do you think
those two can really last?

02:39.450 --> 02:42.078
I don't know. I'm not
an astrologer, Donna.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.580
{\an3}Actually though,
some people do wind up

02:43.663 --> 02:46.040
marrying their high
school sweethearts.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.959
Yeah, I guess so.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.752
DAVID (over P.A. system):
Good morning, West Beverly.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.129
This is your conscience
speaking.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.006
Now, the administration
has asked me to inform

02:53.089 --> 02:57.051
all new and transferred students
to report to the main quad

02:57.135 --> 02:59.220
where you'll be teamed up
with your senior buddies.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.388
There, they'll be able to answer

03:00.471 --> 03:01.347
all those burning questions
you may have,

03:01.431 --> 03:05.476
like, where exactly
is the main quad anyway?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.770
(rock music playing)

03:18.156 --> 03:19.282
{\an3}Nikki.
David.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.785
You told me you were
the school DJ, but what a setup.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.621
{\an1}So what are you
doing here?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.039
I transferred.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.291
{\an3}This has got to be the coolest
place in the entire school.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.085
Well, I thought you were
going back to San Francisco.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.128
{\an3}I did.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.797
But things got
really hairy at home,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.633
so I convinced my folks
to let me move

03:36.716 --> 03:38.635
down to La La Land
and live with my aunt.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.969
That's great.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.137
{\an3}Listen, uh,

03:41.220 --> 03:42.305
{\an3}I'd love
to hang out,

03:42.388 --> 03:44.807
{\an3}but I've got to go
meet my senior buddy.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.644
{\an1}Hope it's not
as geeky as it sounds.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.230
(rock music playing over radio)

03:54.901 --> 03:56.736
We ever look
that young?

03:56.819 --> 03:58.780
I can't believe I'm
actually doing this.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.323
Steve, since when did you
get a dose of school spirit?

04:00.406 --> 04:03.034
{\an3}Oh, I didn't.
I just needed something

04:03.117 --> 04:05.119
{\an3}to write on my
college application.

04:05.203 --> 04:05.954
Figures.

04:06.037 --> 04:06.829
{\an3}Besides, I just
might be paired up

04:06.913 --> 04:08.957
{\an3}with some fine
postpubescent feline.

04:09.040 --> 04:09.958
{\an3}Hello.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.834
Are you Steve Sanders?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.337
{\an3}(chuckles)

04:14.420 --> 04:15.338
At your service.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.464
Are you my new buddy?

04:16.547 --> 04:18.548
No.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.052
That lost little kid
right over there is.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.804
{\an3}(groans)

04:22.887 --> 04:23.805
{\an3}(chuckles)

04:23.888 --> 04:25.014
I'm out of this.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.557
Too late for that.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.184
Steve Sanders.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.395
I found you.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.855
Herbert Little,
your freshman buddy.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.816
{\an3}Well, let's get
one thing straight.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.026
{\an3}You're not my little
buddy, Hubert.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.820
Herbert.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.321
Fine.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.365
I'm only doing this because
it looks good on my transcripts.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.408
So if you stay out of my
hair, don't embarrass me,

04:43.491 --> 04:45.868
{\an3}we'll get along
just fine.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.494
{\an3}Got it, Hubert?
Herbert.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.580
{\an3}(chuckles):
Whatever.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.083
Are you Susie?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.876
Uh, yes.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.878
{\an1}Hi. Brenda Walsh.
I'm your senior buddy.

04:55.962 --> 04:56.713
{\an1}I'm here to answer
any and every question

04:56.796 --> 04:58.923
{\an1}you may have about
good old West Beverly.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.717
Uh, great.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.135
{\an3}Um, where's
the bathroom?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
Is everything okay in there,
Susie?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.395
{\an3}Yeah, everything's
fine. Thanks.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.567
So, anyway, like I was saying,
when I first transferred here,

05:17.650 --> 05:19.777
my friends thought being
a cheerleader was really uncool.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.904
So I didn't go out
for the pep squad,

05:21.988 --> 05:24.741
even though it was something
that I really wanted to do.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.077
Just remember, the key
to being happy in this school

05:28.161 --> 05:29.370
is to forget
about everybody else

05:29.454 --> 05:32.040
and just be your own person.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.668
So what were you saying
about the pep squad?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.104
There you are.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.606
{\an1}I was about
to give up on you.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.482
Sorry, Chief. I was gonna
call you last night,

05:57.565 --> 05:59.484
but it got a little late.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.610
Likely story.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.487
Come here.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.947
I want to show you
what I did so far.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.241
{\an1}I set up
some assignments.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.910
Oh, wait till
you hear this.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.828
{\an1}We have a new
faculty advisor.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.663
What happened to
Miss McCormick?

06:12.747 --> 06:13.915
{\an1}She's seven months
pregnant.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.958
{\an3}I didn't know
she was married.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.919
{\an1}She's not.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.629
{\an1}Ah.
Oh.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.838
So tell me,

06:20.922 --> 06:21.923
should we run a story on it,

06:22.006 --> 06:24.467
or is that a little too tabloid
for <i> The Blaze?</i>

06:24.550 --> 06:26.636
{\an3}Listen, Andrea, that's
kind of what I came here

06:26.719 --> 06:28.012
{\an3}to talk to
you about.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.056
I just don't think
I'm gonna be able

06:30.139 --> 06:31.641
{\an3}to get up for working
on the paper this year.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.142
(chuckles):
Forget it, Brandon.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.936
That is exactly
what you said last year.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.312
{\an3}Well, I'm
serious, Andrea.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.648
{\an3}It's been two years;
it's getting tired already.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.358
Yeah, and we're seniors.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.819
{\an6}This is our chance
to leave our mark.
Exactly.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.821
We're seniors. And I don't want
to have to work that hard.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.155
{\an1}ANDREA:
Well, that's too bad.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.449
{\an1}I need you on staff,
and I'm not letting you quit.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.492
You're not letting me?

06:49.575 --> 06:49.826
No.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.994
(chuckles)

06:52.078 --> 06:53.996
What are you gonna do, chain
me to my computer terminal?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.623
(Meyers laughing)

06:55.706 --> 06:58.000
Don't stop on my account.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
You two were definitely
on a roll.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.380
Are you Mr. Meyers?

07:02.463 --> 07:04.173
This is true.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.675
This is our new
faculty advisor

07:05.758 --> 07:08.052
and our AP English teacher.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.220
This is also true.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.513
Hi. I'm Andrea Zuckerman,

07:10.596 --> 07:11.556
editor-in-chief.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.015
{\an1}And this is
Brandon Walsh,

07:13.099 --> 07:14.600
{\an1}who has the crazy idea
that he's not

07:14.684 --> 07:15.852
{\an1}gonna be sports editor
this year.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.853
{\an3}That's because
I'm not.

07:16.936 --> 07:17.854
(chuckles falsely)

07:17.937 --> 07:19.021
{\an1}Don't worry.
He'll come around.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.022
{\an3}You see what I have
to put up with?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.692
If you're half as good
as Andrea thinks you are,

07:22.775 --> 07:26.028
I just might have to help her
twist your arm.

07:27.947 --> 07:28.865
Great.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.991
Two against one.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.701
Those are my favorite
kind of odds.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.287
{\an1}Mine, too.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.507
Hi.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.884
{\an3}I didn't know you
were in this class.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.720
<i>Yo hablo Español</i>
<i>muy bien, chica.</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:52.597
{\an3}(chuckles)

07:52.680 --> 07:55.057
I don't
<i>hablo</i> at all.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.226
Kelly, I tried
to call you last night.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.062
I was home all night.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.064
I hung up when David answered.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.734
Oh, so that was you.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.777
Yeah, he said
he got a heavy breather.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.737
What'd you want?

08:07.820 --> 08:10.072
I just, I thought
we should talk,

08:10.156 --> 08:11.699
you know, before we walked
in here again for another year.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.412
Don't sweat it.

08:16.495 --> 08:17.371
Hi, guys.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.748
{\an3}Brenda, hi.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.792
This is great.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.086
The three of us are
finally in the same class.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.966
(school bell ringing)

08:31.010 --> 08:33.846
Mr. Meyers.
Mr. Meyers.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.804
Hello, Andrea.

08:34.889 --> 08:35.932
{\an1}Hi. I just wanted
to tell you,

08:36.015 --> 08:38.308
{\an1}I thought your class was
really terrific this morning.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.602
Thanks. I'm trying.

08:39.684 --> 08:40.977
I thought you might
want to take a look

08:41.062 --> 08:42.270
at this preliminary report

08:42.355 --> 08:43.688
{\an3}that I worked up
over the weekend, you know,

08:43.773 --> 08:45.524
summarizing my ideas how to
streamline the editorial process

08:45.608 --> 08:46.817
{\an5}so that, you
know, we can...
Tell you what.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.653
{\an1}Why don't you bring that
to the organizational meeting

08:48.736 --> 08:49.987
{\an1}we're having
after school today.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.740
Oh. Okay, that's...
that's a good idea.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.741
{\an1}See ya.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.909
Uh, just one
other thing.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.077
{\an3}I, uh...

08:56.160 --> 08:57.745
I want you to know
I really appreciate

08:57.828 --> 08:59.789
your trying to help me
keep Brandon on the staff.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.250
He seems like a good guy.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.793
{\an3}Ah, he's a
great guy.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.003
He's a terrific writer
with unlimited potential.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.965
I can't imagine
doing <i> The Blaze</i> without him.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.508
We'll see what we can do.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.134
{\an3}Just, you know,
sometimes,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.804
{\an3}he can get a little lazy
if he's not pushed, but...

09:14.887 --> 09:15.930
That's okay.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.766
Human beings are like that
sometimes.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.809
See ya.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.687
Good-bye.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.733
{\an3}I can't wait for you
to meet this girl, David.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.943
She's just the
type of person

09:29.026 --> 09:30.987
{\an3}you can open up to
right away, you know?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.656
{\an3}I mean, we just have
so much in common.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.657
That's great.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.617
{\an1}Sounds like you really
made a new friend.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.786
{\an3}Yeah, I really
think I did.

09:38.869 --> 09:39.704
{\an3}We just clicked,
you know?

09:39.787 --> 09:40.830
Oh, there's my
student buddy.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.832
{\an3}I want you
to meet her.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.875
Nikki, over here.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.005
{\an3}Hi.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.840
{\an6}Hi.
Nikki, this is my
boyfriend, David.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.800
{\an3}David, this is who
I was talking about.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.011
Hi. Uh, David?

09:55.094 --> 09:55.845
Nice to meet you.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.431
It's nice to meet you, too.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.144
Bren, what do you say
we blow this pop stand

10:03.227 --> 10:04.145
and find someplace else to eat?

10:04.228 --> 10:06.814
{\an3}I can't stand another year
of cafeteria food.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.483
What'd you have in mind?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.568
Well, I don't know.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.737
Um, my place?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.698
{\an1}Yeah, right. I know how much
food is in your fridge.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.159
{\an3}Hey, nobody said anything
about having to eat.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.871
I don't think so.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.664
Not the first day
at school anyway.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.543
Just a thought.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.670
Well, hold that thought.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.063
Hey, there's Kel.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.189
{\an1}Kelly!

10:48.272 --> 10:49.231
{\an1}DYLAN:
Let her go, Bren.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.567
Why?

10:51.650 --> 10:54.612
I just want to have lunch alone.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.988
Oh, that's sweet.

10:56.072 --> 10:56.947
(giggles)

10:57.031 --> 10:58.908
(school bell ringing)

11:00.993 --> 11:04.080
{\an3}So fill out
these cards

11:04.163 --> 11:06.207
{\an3}and let me know a little
bit about yourself.

11:06.290 --> 11:10.378
And don't be shy because,
well, I'm easily impressed.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.879
{\an1}Nice to see you,
Mr. Walsh.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.298
Yeah, like I had
a choice in the matter.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.174
{\an1}(chuckles)

11:15.257 --> 11:17.301
{\an3}But, more importantly,
I want to know

11:17.385 --> 11:19.387
{\an3}what you want to do
on the paper this term

11:19.470 --> 11:21.430
so that you don't keel over
from terminal boredom.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.181
This guy is sharp.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.808
What a great way
to boost morale.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.309
{\an3}MEYERS:
In any event,

11:25.393 --> 11:27.895
I read the first four issues
of last year's paper over lunch,

11:27.978 --> 11:31.941
and, well, found it to be
eminently more digestible

11:32.024 --> 11:34.276
than the mystery meat they were
serving in the cafeteria.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.277
(laughter)

11:35.361 --> 11:36.570
{\an3}You guys did
good work.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.571
{\an3}I was very
impressed.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.782
But I know you can do better,
a lot better.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.867
Now, with regards
to the layout...

11:41.951 --> 11:42.952
Excuse me, Mr. Meyers?

11:43.035 --> 11:46.747
{\an3}Uh, what specifically
didn't you like about it?

11:46.831 --> 11:47.957
Don't get me wrong.
It was very readable.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.752
I just think the layout could
use a little more graphics,

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
{\an6}and the editorial
style could be a
little more precise.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.506
Well, what you didn't know is

11:55.589 --> 11:57.800
that 70% of the staff
was new last fall,

11:57.883 --> 12:00.636
so I'm sure when you read
what we did in the spring,

12:00.719 --> 12:02.972
you'll see why the <i> Blaze</i> went on
to win a Quill and Scroll Award.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.976
I'm well aware
of your accomplishments, Andrea.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.102
Ahn-drea.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.437
(pronouncing correctly):
Andrea.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.813
Clearly, you're
a first-rate editor,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.857
and since this is my first day,

12:12.940 --> 12:13.858
I don't want
to ruffle any feathers.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.901
But that doesn't mean

12:15.985 --> 12:16.944
there's no room for improvement,
does it?

12:17.027 --> 12:19.822
No.

12:19.905 --> 12:20.448
{\an3}Good.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.450
Now, moving
right along,

12:22.533 --> 12:23.993
{\an3}does anyone have
any questions?

12:25.035 --> 12:26.328
Yes?

12:26.412 --> 12:26.954
Are you married?

12:27.037 --> 12:29.039
(laughter)

12:34.879 --> 12:36.172
{\an5}BRANDON:
Andrea, if he didn't
like you,

12:36.255 --> 12:38.799
{\an1}why did he say you were
a first-class editor, huh?

12:38.883 --> 12:40.050
{\an5}It's just a vibe
I'm getting from
him, that's all.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.470
{\an1}What are you
so insecure about?

12:42.553 --> 12:43.679
{\an3}(sighs)
I don't know.

12:43.762 --> 12:44.597
I just feel
like all day

12:44.680 --> 12:46.056
I've been saying the
wrong thing to him.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.850
{\an1}Well, maybe you have
a crush on him.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.312
What was the name of that
drama teacher you went out with?

12:51.395 --> 12:53.856
{\an6}Will you get your mind
out of the gutter,
please? I'm serious.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.858
{\an3}I have to find
a way to show him

12:55.941 --> 12:57.568
{\an3}how much passion I have
for the newspaper,

12:57.651 --> 12:58.027
how committed I am.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.153
Will you relax?

12:59.236 --> 13:02.698
Once Meyers finds out
what a great journalist you are,

13:02.781 --> 13:04.825
he'll be kissing the ground
you walk on.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.117
Yeah.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.203
{\an1}(laughs)

13:07.286 --> 13:10.164
CINDY:
<i>Ready for the burgers, honey?</i>

13:10.247 --> 13:11.373
Forget about
the burgers.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.000
{\an3}I can't even get
the coals started.

13:13.083 --> 13:13.918
{\an3}What's the matter, Dad?
Lost your touch.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.545
Well, I'm lost
without lighter fluid.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.214
We may be saving
the ozone layer,

13:18.297 --> 13:19.882
but we're going
to die of starvation.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.425
{\an5}DYLAN:
Come on, Jim.
I mean,

13:21.509 --> 13:24.553
{\an1}I'm not a Boy Scout,
but I can start a barbecue.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.263
{\an3}This is not just
any barbecue, Dylan.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.223
It's a smoke 'n bake.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.933
{\an3}Oh, that's right.
It's not just a grill.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.935
{\an3}It's a
mira-grill.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.187
{\an1}JIM:
Hey, it's tricky, okay?

13:33.270 --> 13:35.397
BRANDON (laughing):
You're right, Dad.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.732
Come on, papa-san.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.568
Let me show you how you do
this fire-starting thing.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.361
Be my guest.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.238
{\an3}Well, it's simple
aerodynamics.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.657
{\an1}Oh, I see, I see,
I see, I see.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.075
{\an1}What a difference
a summer makes.

13:46.158 --> 13:46.951
{\an3}I told you,
all Dad needed

13:47.034 --> 13:50.412
{\an1}was some time
to get used to Dylan.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.081
Yeah. Like, two years.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.416
{\an6}Brandon, what
you're seeing
is male bonding

13:54.500 --> 13:56.085
at its very best.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.420
{\an3}A fire is
involved.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.299
Cindy, you, uh...
you got any newspaper?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.592
{\an3}(laughs)

14:03.676 --> 14:05.678
Sure, Dylan.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.139
{\an1}Come here.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.935
{\an1}(laughs)

14:13.018 --> 14:15.896
KELLY:
<i>Every time I turn around,</i>

14:15.980 --> 14:16.981
<i>I see him hugging her</i>
<i>or kissing her.</i>

14:17.064 --> 14:19.191
I don't know
if I'm going to make it

14:19.275 --> 14:21.569
through a whole year of this.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.654
{\an3}Kel, can I ask you
something, and I really

14:23.737 --> 14:25.406
don't mean to be getting
too personal or anything?

14:25.489 --> 14:26.615
What?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.075
Are you in love
with Dylan or something?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.077
No!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.079
I just can't stand

14:32.162 --> 14:34.415
being in every class
with him <i> and</i> Brenda.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.499
That's all.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.502
{\an3}Yeah, well, you're worried
about surviving a year.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.128
I may not last a week.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.964
Why?

14:42.047 --> 14:42.798
Remember Nikki, that girl

14:42.881 --> 14:44.133
who I messed around with
this summer?

14:44.216 --> 14:46.510
Well, she just

14:46.594 --> 14:47.803
transferred to West Beverly,

14:47.886 --> 14:49.179
and guess
who her new senior buddy is?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.472
Uh-oh.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.974
Yeah, when the three
of us are together,

14:52.057 --> 14:53.017
she acts like
she's never met me.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.353
When we're alone,
she's clearly coming on to me.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.521
(laughs)
You're right.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.815
You're probably not going
to make it through a whole week.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.150
So, what do I do?

15:01.233 --> 15:05.029
Come clean.
That's your only choice.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.031
♪ You're the one

15:07.114 --> 15:08.157

15:08.240 --> 15:10.326
Absolutely.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.328
It's better that Donna find out
from you than from Nikki.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.330

Mr. Meyers!

15:35.142 --> 15:37.227
{\an1}What are you doing
at the public library

15:37.311 --> 15:39.521
on the first night of school?

15:39.605 --> 15:41.190
{\an3}Well, like you said
in class today,

15:41.273 --> 15:43.317
{\an3}reading a good book
is like doing aerobics

15:43.400 --> 15:44.526
for the imagination.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.028
(both laughing)

15:46.111 --> 15:48.822
{\an1}Let me ask your opinion
about something.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.407
Brandon Walsh.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.409
Is he motivated?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.161
Without a doubt.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.747
{\an1}Do you think
he's a leader?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.082
Everybody likes him.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.918
I know he's popular.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.545
{\an1}What I want to know--
is he a leader?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.090
Could be.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.884
I think he's a little bored
being the sports editor.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.177
{\an3}(laughs)

16:10.260 --> 16:11.553
To say the least.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.097
You know, I think
if you gave him more,

16:13.180 --> 16:14.223
if you challenged him,

16:14.306 --> 16:16.975
he could really rise
to the occasion.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.102
{\an1}That's exactly
what I had in mind.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.729
Really? What were you thinking?

16:20.813 --> 16:25.025
I was thinking that he has
a chance to be a real star,

16:25.109 --> 16:26.276
but he needs a swift kick
in the butt.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.239
{\an4}(laughs)
And since you've done it
for the last two years,

16:30.322 --> 16:33.784
I was thinking we make him
the next editor-in-chief.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.912
{\an1}And you could be the woman
behind the man.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.792
What do you think?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.878
Yeah.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.601

19:14.153 --> 19:15.070
What?

19:15.153 --> 19:16.446
{\an1}You two ganging up
on me again?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.407
Since no one else volunteered,

19:18.490 --> 19:19.908
Andrea and I have decided

19:19.992 --> 19:21.702
that you are the best person
at this school

19:21.785 --> 19:24.246
to become the next
editor-in-chief of the <i> Blaze.</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:27.082
It's a joke, right?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.668
Nope.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.754
{\an1}You had something to do
with this?

19:32.838 --> 19:35.883
Congratulations, Chief.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.936
Oh.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.938
I'm really sorry.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.940
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.942
I think that one's mine.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.944
Oh, here you go.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.113
Thanks.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.285
{\an3}Mr. Meyers...
Mr. Meyers.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.453
Brandon, I've got
to level with you.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.164
{\an1}Every time someone calls me
Mr. Meyers

20:07.247 --> 20:08.916
{\an1}I keep looking around
for my father.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.541
{\an1}So when we're out
of class,

20:09.625 --> 20:11.668
why don't you call me Gil...

20:11.752 --> 20:14.087
{\an1}especially now since
you're the big kahuna.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.632
{\an3}Actually, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.300
{\an1}Don't tell me you're getting
cold feet already.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.093
{\an3}No, no, no,
I just, uh,

20:20.177 --> 20:22.304
I need to get something
straight in my own head.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.931
Can we go talk
for a minute?

20:24.014 --> 20:27.017
Sure.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.978
{\an3}BRANDON:
So Andrea was okay

20:30.062 --> 20:30.812
with me taking
over the paper?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.981
{\an6}MEYERS:
She was your
biggest booster.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.942
{\an3}She's behind
you 100%.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.945
{\an1}Well, to be honest
with you, Gil,

20:38.028 --> 20:38.737
in my humble opinion,

20:38.820 --> 20:40.447
{\an1}she's the one
who deserves the job.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.449
{\an3}She's done it for
the last two years.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.451
{\an3}The poor girl needs a
break, for God's sakes.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.995
{\an1}Well, granted,
Andrea is intense,

20:47.079 --> 20:50.040
{\an1}but... it's like the <i> Blaze</i>
is her entire life.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.125
My point exactly.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.047
Listen, I'm really flattered

20:57.130 --> 20:58.840
{\an1}that you have that much
confidence in me,

20:58.924 --> 21:01.802
{\an1}but I've always been more
of a team player.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.930
But eventually every player's
got to step up

21:05.013 --> 21:05.597
to the plate, don't they?

21:05.681 --> 21:08.016
Yeah, but it's my senior year.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.186
{\an1}I, I wanted to just kick back
and cruise, you know?

21:11.269 --> 21:12.980
{\an3}And what...

21:13.063 --> 21:14.022
"party, radical, dude?"

21:14.106 --> 21:14.982
Is that
what we're talking about?

21:15.065 --> 21:16.858
'Cause if we are,
I can totally relate.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.403
You're talking to the
original couch potato.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.029
{\an3}The thought
of reading

21:21.113 --> 21:24.032
for my own pleasure was
completely foreign to me

21:24.116 --> 21:26.034
till I was a senior
in high school,

21:26.118 --> 21:28.704
and then everything changed.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.706
What happened?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.874
{\an3}My English teacher
gave me a book of poems

21:32.958 --> 21:34.543
by Walt Whitman.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.878
"It's only life...

21:36.962 --> 21:41.633
with its immense passion,
pulse, and power."

21:47.305 --> 21:49.266
You really think
I'm up for this?

21:49.349 --> 21:51.852
Go for it, Brandon.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.522
{\an3}You want <i> me</i> to
give a barbecue?

21:55.605 --> 21:58.066
Dylan, you have
that big house

21:58.150 --> 22:00.068
and you never use it.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.903
{\an3}I don't know.
(sighs)

22:01.987 --> 22:03.363
Hi, Brenda.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.531
{\an3}BRENDA:
Hi, Sue.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.411
{\an1}Bren, you know
that girl?

22:09.494 --> 22:10.620
Yeah, that's my
freshman buddy.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.790
{\an1}Mmm, what reform school
did she escape from?

22:13.874 --> 22:14.958
Ha.

22:15.042 --> 22:15.792
Ha.
(giggles)

22:15.876 --> 22:19.087
Come on.
A barbecue is a great idea.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.422
We'll have it
this Friday night.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.214
We'll invite everybody.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.216
{\an1}Donna, Kelly...
speaking of which...

22:23.300 --> 22:25.218
{\an1}Kelly wasn't in Spanish class
this morning.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.304
Where is she?

22:27.637 --> 22:30.432
{\an3}Mrs. Teasley,
I was wondering

22:30.515 --> 22:32.559
if I could make a small change
in my schedule.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.269
What did you have in mind,
Kelly?

22:34.352 --> 22:35.562
{\an3}Well, Donna was
telling me

22:35.645 --> 22:37.272
{\an3}about this incredible
art class she's taking,

22:37.355 --> 22:39.274
and I was wondering
if I can still get in.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.442
I don't recall your ever
expressing any interest

22:40.525 --> 22:42.736
in art before.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.738
Oh, I know.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.656
I just thought since
it's my senior year and all,

22:46.740 --> 22:50.911
maybe it's time for me
to explore my creative side.

22:50.994 --> 22:51.745
{\an3}Try something
new.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.831
Well, there is room
in the class,

22:54.915 --> 22:57.125
but you do realize
switching into art

22:57.209 --> 22:58.627
will necessitate rearranging
your entire schedule.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.964
Oh, really? That's too bad,

23:03.048 --> 23:07.219
but if that's
what we've gotta do.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.388
{\an1}So, what are you doing
after school?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.641
{\an3}I told Nikki I'd drop her off
at the Beverly Center. Why?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.936
{\an1}Uh, well, what about
later on tonight?

23:16.019 --> 23:16.853
{\an3}Nikki's coming
over for dinner.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.980
{\an3}I mean, you can come,
too, if you want.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.149
No, that's okay.

23:21.233 --> 23:21.817
David, what's wrong?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.485
{\an3}Is everything
all right?

23:23.568 --> 23:24.820
Yeah.

23:24.903 --> 23:25.987
Everything's fine.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.074
Okay.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.670
Private Zuckerman
reporting for duty, sir.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.213
Andrea, just in time.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.673
Take a look at the new layout.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.632
What do you think?

23:45.715 --> 23:47.676
{\an1}Why are you changing
the layout?

23:47.759 --> 23:51.054
Well, the old one's
kind of flat, don't you think?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.515
No, I, uh, I liked it.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.350
{\an1}Mr. Meyers thought
it looked flat.

23:55.433 --> 23:59.062
{\an3}So what
should I do?

23:59.146 --> 23:59.688
Let's leave
the layout alone, okay?

23:59.771 --> 24:00.689
Andrea's right.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.191
Okay, Chief.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.901
Listen, before I forget,
Meyers thought I should

24:04.985 --> 24:05.735
{\an3}take a look at
that report you did

24:05.819 --> 24:07.821
{\an3}on how to streamline
the paper.

24:07.904 --> 24:08.780
Oh, he did, did he?

24:08.864 --> 24:11.992
{\an3}Yeah.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.827
Can I see you outside?

24:22.252 --> 24:24.045
This is not going to work out.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.756
What isn't?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.133
Brandon, you're editor-in-chief.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.093
It's your job
to streamline the paper.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.137
I am merely
one of the foot soldiers.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.555
And I am not gonna hand over
my ideas, which I stayed up

24:33.638 --> 24:36.892
until 2:00 in the morning
to write, so that you

24:36.975 --> 24:38.185
{\an3}can take
the credit.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.020
Andrea, maybe you're
suffering from...

24:40.103 --> 24:41.271
sleep deprivation or something--

24:41.354 --> 24:44.191
I don't know-- 'cause I don't
know where this is coming from.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.734
Gil merely told me
you'd written a report

24:45.817 --> 24:47.319
that may be
of some assistance to me.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.696
Now, if you don't want to give
it to me, it's no big deal.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.906
Gil?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.866
Well, I didn't realize
you guys became so chummy.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.619
Look, Andrea, if you wanted
to be editor so badly,

24:55.702 --> 24:58.163
why'd you back me for the job?

24:58.246 --> 24:58.788
Excuse me.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.790
What was I supposed to do?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.752
Tell him you procrastinate,
that you're disorganized,

25:03.835 --> 25:04.878
that you're not
nearly as qualified

25:04.961 --> 25:06.588
to run <i> The Blaze</i> as I am?

25:06.671 --> 25:07.589
Hold on a second.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.715
{\an3}No, that's
the truth.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.800
You do not have as much
experience as I have,

25:10.884 --> 25:12.427
and you definitely
don't have the commitment!

25:12.510 --> 25:15.931
I can do the job, Andrea,
just as well as you can.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.307
Great.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.018
Then why don't you do
the whole damn thing yourself.

25:21.811 --> 25:22.771
Oh, that's just
great, Andrea.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.190
{\an1}Walk away.

25:25.273 --> 25:29.027
It's not my fault you're too
egotistical to deal with this!

25:54.886 --> 25:56.805
{\an1}STEVE:
You see, Silver?

25:56.888 --> 25:59.641
{\an1}This is what it means
to have a manager.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.768
{\an1}I put up my own bucks
for these.

26:01.851 --> 26:06.106
Well, that's great, but
who plays 45s anymore?

26:06.189 --> 26:08.191
Get with the program, David.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.943
{\an1}I'm gonna put these
in jukeboxes.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.363
I'm gonna have this puppy
playing in every diner in town.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.032
But not here at
the Pit, okay?

26:16.116 --> 26:17.867
What are you talking about?
Of course here at the Pit.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.287
Look, Nikki thinks
she's the first person

26:20.370 --> 26:21.246
who heard this song,
and Donna thinks

26:21.329 --> 26:23.498
she's the first person
who heard this song.

26:23.581 --> 26:26.543
You told me I was the first
person who heard this song.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.505
Well, I was excited
about it, okay?

26:30.588 --> 26:33.300
Look, I don't care who was the
first person to hear this song.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.759
It's going into Nat's jukebox.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.846
I know I'm gonna have
to tell Donna about Nikki.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.515
It's just things have been going
so great,

26:40.598 --> 26:41.558
I don't want to ruin it.

26:41.641 --> 26:45.103
{\an3}So, who says tell
Donna anything?

26:45.186 --> 26:46.521
{\an1}Well, Kelly
and Nikki said...

26:46.604 --> 26:49.482
Kelly and Nikki,
Nikki and Schmikki, okay?

26:49.566 --> 26:52.235
Look, Kelly is
Donna's best friend.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.696
And Nikki, come on, she just
wants to break you guys up

26:54.779 --> 26:56.031
so she could get to you.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.491
So, what do you think
I should do?

26:58.575 --> 27:02.245
Make Nikki a little side dish.

27:02.329 --> 27:02.704
What, are you kidding?

27:02.787 --> 27:03.705
I can't do that.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.041
I don't even want to do that.

27:06.124 --> 27:06.833
All right, but don't tell Donna.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.710
She'll freak.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.254
Well, what if Nikki tells Donna?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.381
You know, the two of them
have gotten pretty tight.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.551
David, let me tell you
three words of advice

27:16.634 --> 27:18.345
that have always worked for me:

27:18.428 --> 27:20.055
Deny, deny, deny.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.730
All I can say is
everybody better be hungry.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.441
You have a ton of food.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.901
{\an3}Yeah, I guess I better
learn to cook, too, huh?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.236
What?

27:35.320 --> 27:39.032
Brenda, I've never, ever
barbecued anything in my life.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.700
I ordered room service,
remember?

27:40.784 --> 27:43.411
Then what was the show
you put on for my father?

27:43.495 --> 27:46.081
Oh, I was just trying
to be helpful, you know.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.123
I can't cook.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.292
Dylan, what are we gonna do?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.086
This is gonna be
a total disaster.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.295
No, it won't.
I mean, you'll help me,

27:52.379 --> 27:54.297
{\an3}won't you?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.924
Dylan...

27:56.007 --> 27:58.301
{\an1}Won't you?

27:58.385 --> 27:59.135
{\an3}All right.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.262
{\an3}But the first thing
we better do,

28:01.346 --> 28:03.556
if you're gonna have
a party, is clean up.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.642
{\an3}Okay, but, Bren, do we
got to do that right now?

28:09.854 --> 28:10.772
What is this?

28:10.855 --> 28:11.815
Looks like an earring.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.442
I know it's an earring, Dylan.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.402
Whose is it?

28:15.485 --> 28:16.903
Must be my mother's.

28:16.986 --> 28:17.987
Remember, I told you
she stopped by here

28:18.071 --> 28:20.448
for a few days
on her way to

28:20.532 --> 28:22.492
a convergence retreat in Sedona.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.577
Right.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.996
Well, you better call her
and tell her that you found it.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.832
Well, I will.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.975
{\an1}I didn't see you
in class yesterday.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.017
What happened?
Did you skip?

28:48.101 --> 28:49.310
No.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.187
Actually, I changed
my schedule around.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.814
I wanted to take art with Donna.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.983
No offense, Kel, I've known you
since kindergarten;

28:55.066 --> 28:57.026
you couldn't draw a straight
line if you had a ruler.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.780
Well, maybe it's time I learned.

29:00.864 --> 29:01.322
{\an1}Maybe.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.451
This is yours, I think.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.494
Oh, thank you.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.495
I was looking for that.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.497
Yeah, well, don't thank me.
Thank Brenda.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.041
She's the one
that found it.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.293
You didn't tell her, did you?

29:13.376 --> 29:15.503
No, I didn't tell her.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.630
I said it was my mother's.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.468
Guess I won't be wearing
those earrings anymore.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.510
{\an1}Kelly...

29:22.594 --> 29:23.219
{\an3}I didn't like
'em anyway.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.804
Look, for what it's worth,

29:24.888 --> 29:27.182
if you hadn't changed
your schedule, I would have.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.350
That way, it'd be more
comfortable for everybody.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.729
Dylan, I am not doing anything

29:32.812 --> 29:34.814
to make things more comfortable
for everybody.

29:34.898 --> 29:35.857
Just for me.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.359
{\an3}You and Brenda
have each other.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.319
And I don't begrudge you that,

29:39.402 --> 29:41.571
but I don't have to sit around
and watch it

29:41.654 --> 29:43.448
with a perpetual lump
in my throat.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.369
{\an1}So, are you coming
to the barbecue tonight?

29:48.453 --> 29:49.829
Sure.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.706
{\an3}I can't believe
Dylan's being so sociable.

29:51.789 --> 29:53.833
{\an1}I'm telling you,
he's a changed man.

29:53.917 --> 29:54.834
Mmm.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.503
{\an1}Oh, my God, hide me.
Huh?

29:56.586 --> 29:58.213
Hi, Brenda.
Hi, Donna.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.298
Hi.
Hi, Sue.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.049
Where you going?

30:01.132 --> 30:03.176
{\an1}Wherever
they're taking me.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.969
(shrieks)

30:05.220 --> 30:08.264
{\an3}How do you
know her?

30:08.348 --> 30:09.557
That's Sue Scanlon.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.392
{\an3}Donna, I know
who she is.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.393
{\an3}She's my
freshman buddy.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.103
She's also Scott's sister.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.397
Scott Scanlon.

30:16.481 --> 30:20.360
{\an3}Wow, I can't believe I
didn't make the connection.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.402
{\an1}Yeah.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.239
{\an1}Well, my mom says the family
has really fallen apart

30:24.322 --> 30:25.365
since Scott shot himself.

30:25.448 --> 30:29.244
{\an1}Mrs. Scanlon's always been
kind of weird though.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.120
{\an3}Like mother,
like daughter.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.707
(school bell ringing)

30:38.002 --> 30:40.421
Okay, that's it for today.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.257
Andrea, could you stay
for a minute, please?

30:52.642 --> 30:55.562
How come you've been shooting me
death rays for the last hour?

30:55.645 --> 30:58.064
How come you haven't called
on me in the last hour?

30:58.147 --> 31:03.194
{\an1}Because I knew you knew
all the answers.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.448
Listen, I was gonna wait
until the newspaper meeting

31:07.532 --> 31:11.327
to tell you this, but I, uh,
might as well tell you now.

31:13.246 --> 31:13.955
I'm resigning from <i> The Blaze.</i>

31:14.038 --> 31:16.040
Why do you want to do that?

31:21.421 --> 31:23.590
Because you ripped me off,
that's why.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.134
I'm the one who
saved the paper

31:26.217 --> 31:28.970
when nobody wanted
to work on it.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.306
I found new advertisers.
I recruited staff.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.141
{\an3}I updated the
computer system.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.978
I sacrificed
my nights and weekends.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.273
And then you walk in,
and in one fell swoop,

31:40.356 --> 31:41.107
you take the whole thing
away from me.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.152
My God, Andrea.

31:44.235 --> 31:47.363
I had no idea you felt this way.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.198
Why didn't you
just say something?

31:53.286 --> 31:55.163
Because I wanted you to like me.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.248
I do like you.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.211
But not as much
as you like Brandon.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.214
You know why I put
Brandon in charge.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.259
He's the kind of guy
who needs a push.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.677
We talked about this.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.012
{\an1}Now, that doesn't mean
I don't think you're terrific.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.348
{\an1}But don't you think
it's time

32:13.431 --> 32:15.183
{\an1}you learned how
to be a team player?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.185
{\an1}You're not always gonna be
number one, you know.

32:17.268 --> 32:21.397
And sometimes,
overachievers like you

32:21.481 --> 32:23.358
have to get past their own egos

32:23.441 --> 32:25.234
and learn how to accept
disappointment.

32:33.326 --> 32:36.204
That is so bogus.

32:36.287 --> 32:40.208
If I were a guy, you would be
congratulating me on my ambition

32:40.291 --> 32:41.209
instead of calling me
an overachiever.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.879
You're teaching the male

32:44.962 --> 32:48.341
how to be a leader and the
female how to be a team player.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.219
If you're implying
that I'm sexist,

32:51.302 --> 32:53.388
you are dead wrong.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.722
Oh, really?

32:54.806 --> 32:58.226
Why is it we call
a male assertive

32:58.309 --> 33:01.729
and a female pushy?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.023
Why is a guy tough
and a girl a bitch?

33:05.775 --> 33:09.404
What would Walt Whitman
say about that...

33:09.487 --> 33:11.322
Gil?

33:24.377 --> 33:25.920
I love that
art class.

33:26.003 --> 33:26.921
Oh, me, too.

33:27.004 --> 33:28.339
Mrs. Signorelli is great.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.092
{\an3}You know, I have
that same top?

33:31.175 --> 33:32.760
God, we do have
a lot in common.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.219
(both giggle)

33:33.302 --> 33:35.179
Art, clothes...

33:35.263 --> 33:37.098
{\an3}And our incredible
taste in guys.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.141
{\an1}Oh. David is cute,
isn't he?

33:38.224 --> 33:41.269
{\an3}The best.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.230
Listen, Donna, I am so glad
you're okay with all this.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.149
{\an3}I have to admit
I was real nervous

33:46.232 --> 33:48.943
about David telling you.

33:49.026 --> 33:50.361
What are you talking about?

33:50.445 --> 33:52.780
{\an3}He didn't
tell you?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.282
He promised me
he'd tell you last night.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.618
Well, he didn't.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.412
But I have this feeling
that somebody better.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.330
Donna, please, believe me,
nothing happened.

34:01.414 --> 34:05.376
{\an3}It's just, when you were
in Paris this summer,

34:05.460 --> 34:08.629
and I came here to Beverly Hills
to visit my aunt,

34:08.713 --> 34:10.130
I met David at the beach club.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.424
So if nothing happened,

34:11.507 --> 34:13.342
why'd you pretend
like you hadn't met him before?

34:13.426 --> 34:16.429
I didn't know if you knew, and I
wasn't sure how you'd take it.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.181
Well, would you mind telling me
just how far things went?

34:19.264 --> 34:21.434
Did you sleep with him, Nikki?

34:21.516 --> 34:22.226
Donna, no!

34:22.310 --> 34:23.603
Please, it was nothing
like that.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.313
{\an3}We met, we
listened to music.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.817
And we just kissed.
That's all.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.319
Oh.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.362
So I'm supposed
to feel relieved

34:33.446 --> 34:34.822
because all you did was kiss?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.616
That's all we do.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.659
Well, I want you to know
something.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.540
When it came down to really
fooling around,

34:44.623 --> 34:47.251
David told me about you
and said that he couldn't.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.295
{\an3}If you never want
to talk to me again,

34:50.379 --> 34:51.505
I understand.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.174
But don't blame
David, please.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.382
He's such a great guy.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.385
Yeah.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.305
A great guy who somehow forgot
to tell his girlfriend

34:59.388 --> 35:01.307
about the fling he had
this summer.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.351
Donna, don't get mad at him.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.687
No.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.356
I'm not gonna get mad.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.776
I'm gonna get even.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.008
Man.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.010
{\an3}Hey, what's
going on?

35:38.094 --> 35:39.762
{\an1}They won't give me
my books.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.723
{\an4}MILLER:
Just a little
healthy hazing.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.725
Here, Hubert.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.977
What's your problem,
Sanders?

35:46.060 --> 35:46.936
{\an3}STEVE:
Look, Miller.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.021
{\an3}You can pick on all
the freshmen you want.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.064
{\an3}Just not my
freshman, okay?

35:50.147 --> 35:51.357
You know this nerd?

35:51.440 --> 35:53.359
{\an3}Yeah, I do.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.361
Now beat it, kid.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.071
Thank you, sir.

35:57.154 --> 36:00.199
(all chuckle)

36:01.868 --> 36:04.871
{\an1}You really are a nerd,
aren't you?

36:04.954 --> 36:06.998
Don't call me "sir."

36:07.081 --> 36:08.749
Fine.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.585
{\an3}As long as you don't
call me Hubert.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.546
{\an1}(laughs)

36:13.629 --> 36:16.257
Let's go, Herbert.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.889
(both chuckle)

36:22.972 --> 36:24.932
Don't you think it's about time
we introduced ourselves?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.726
Hi, I'm Nikki Witt.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.728
Brandon Walsh.

36:28.811 --> 36:31.772
Well, maybe we'll run
into each other again sometime.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.441
Maybe.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.752
Sue.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.462
Oh, don't mind me.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.505
{\an1}I'm just doing my daily
"makeover" again.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.965
Time to turn back

36:58.049 --> 37:01.302
{\an1}into little
Susie Sunshine.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.179
Hey, I know
from experience

37:03.262 --> 37:05.765
what it's like pretending
to be somebody you're not.

37:05.848 --> 37:09.018
{\an1}Yeah, well, it beats hassling
with my mother.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.103
You think so?

37:14.273 --> 37:16.275
{\an1}You don't know
my mother.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.277
Yes, I do...

37:18.361 --> 37:21.113
{\an3}and I knew
your brother, too.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.995
Before or after
he shot himself?

37:30.039 --> 37:33.042
Actually, I didn't know Scott
that well.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.712
But I was at his birthday party
that night,

37:36.796 --> 37:38.881
and I was there

37:38.965 --> 37:40.883
{\an3}when David Silver
buried a time capsule

37:40.967 --> 37:43.844
in Scott's memory.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.639
And I can be there for you, too,
if you want.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.641
Why?

37:48.724 --> 37:50.643
Because you say
you were Scott's friend

37:50.726 --> 37:51.519
or because you feel sorry
for me?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.854
Because you're my
freshman buddy...

37:53.938 --> 37:55.856
and I hate to see you
working so hard

37:55.940 --> 37:57.358
just to earn a bad reputation.

37:57.441 --> 38:01.487
Look, I don't care what you
or anybody else thinks about me.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.322
{\an3}Well, obviously,
you care

38:03.406 --> 38:05.741
about what your
mother thinks.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.034
Otherwise, you wouldn't bother

38:07.118 --> 38:08.661
cleaning up your act
every afternoon.

38:08.744 --> 38:12.415
She's going to learn
the truth eventually, you know.

38:14.458 --> 38:18.587
You don't know what it's like
living in that house.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.588
Look, if you want to talk
to a counselor,

38:19.672 --> 38:22.091
I could give you
some people to call.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.555
Thanks.

38:27.638 --> 38:31.517
I just might take you up
on that.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.562
Anytime.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.823
How's it going?

38:45.906 --> 38:47.575
I'm not a happy camper.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.453
{\an3}It could take me
three weeks

38:50.536 --> 38:51.912
just to get the
budget in order.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.914
Not to mention
assigning features,

38:53.998 --> 38:54.582
selling ad space, paste-up.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.584
I know.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.919
It's a lot of responsibility.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.921
What's the matter, Gil?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.591
Are you feeling guilty
about ruining my carefree youth?

39:03.674 --> 39:06.469
Guilty, yes.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.553
But not about you.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.556
It's about Andrea.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.642
{\an1}She really laid
into me.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.480
It's my fault.

39:17.563 --> 39:18.564
{\an1}How could I put her
in the tough spot

39:18.647 --> 39:21.192
{\an1}of having to choose
between her own ambitions

39:21.275 --> 39:22.735
{\an1}and her affections
for you?

39:25.071 --> 39:28.616
Do you think I'm sexist?

39:30.659 --> 39:32.787
What's that got
to do with this?

39:32.870 --> 39:34.080
Everything.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.082
I can't believe
I was so oblivious.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.084
I've read all the studies,
Brandon...

39:38.167 --> 39:40.920
about how teachers don't call
on teenage girls as much as guys

39:41.003 --> 39:43.130
{\an1}and that time and time again
they'll ignore

39:43.214 --> 39:46.300
even the most talented female
student in favor of a boy.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.427
I never thought I'd do it.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.932
Listen...

39:53.015 --> 39:55.684
I... I don't want to sound
like a quitter 'cause I'm not...

39:55.768 --> 39:58.854
but if you want to give
the paper back to Andrea,

39:58.938 --> 39:59.897
I'd understand.

39:59.980 --> 40:04.985
I don't think that'd be fair
to either of you.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.114
Yeah, maybe you're right.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.617
How do we get out
of the doghouse?

40:26.590 --> 40:28.509
{\an3}I had a feeling
I'd find you here.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.511
{\an3}You wanna proof
our new masthead?

40:30.594 --> 40:31.846
{\an3}Brandon...
No, Andrea,

40:31.929 --> 40:33.931
just take a look
at it, would ya?

40:36.392 --> 40:38.310
{\an1}This says Brandon Walsh
and Andrea Zuckerman,

40:38.394 --> 40:40.229
Co-editors-in-chief.
Yup.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.815
{\an3}My first
executive decision.

40:42.898 --> 40:45.526
Look, I don't need your pity,
okay, Brandon?

40:45.609 --> 40:47.528
Andrea, it's not pity.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.364
<i>The Blaze</i> is your paper.
It's your passion.

40:50.447 --> 40:52.449
Let me be your partner.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.412
We make a good team, you and me.

40:58.455 --> 41:00.249
You and I.

41:00.332 --> 41:03.085
(clears throat)

41:03.169 --> 41:06.297
So are we partners or what?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.009
Sounds good to me, Chief.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.927
Co-chief.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.680
So when do we start?

41:14.763 --> 41:17.016
We start on Monday.

41:17.099 --> 41:17.933
Tonight,

41:18.017 --> 41:20.060
{\an3}we party.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.568

41:27.651 --> 41:29.570
There's a Zen thing
with the, uh,

41:29.653 --> 41:30.779
barbecue here, Steve.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.740
You gotta become one
with the burger.

41:32.823 --> 41:33.908
Yeah, well, those
burgers look like

41:33.991 --> 41:35.743
{\an3}they've become one
with the grill.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.870
Hey, man, this spatula can
become one with your face.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.246
Ooh.
Ooh, come on.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.540
I hate violence.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.542
{\an1}Dylan, hi.

41:43.626 --> 41:44.877
Hey, Donna.

41:46.837 --> 41:47.755
Nikki?

41:47.838 --> 41:48.923
Brandon?

41:49.006 --> 41:49.882
Do you two know each other?

41:49.965 --> 41:54.553
Um, we've bumped
into each other a few times.

Yeah.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.321
Oh, uh...

42:12.404 --> 42:14.448
{\an3}David couldn't decide
what to wear.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.786
{\an1}Uh, could you excuse me
a second?

42:18.869 --> 42:20.788
{\an3}Sure.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.791
We need to talk.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.960
Sure.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.087
Alone.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.090
Right.

42:31.882 --> 42:35.928
{\an1}David, I can't take it
anymore.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.930
{\an1}You've got to tell Donna
about us right away.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.932
{\an3}Look, Nikki,
there is no us.

42:40.015 --> 42:42.476
But David, I want you.

42:42.559 --> 42:43.978
{\an3}I know, but you're gonna
have to get over it.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.104
Look, I love Donna,

42:45.187 --> 42:46.647
{\an3}and I know I should have
told her, and I will.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.857
{\an3}But I've just gotta wait
for the right moment.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.651
You've gotta stop.

42:50.734 --> 42:51.694
Busted!

42:51.777 --> 42:53.779
Donna...

42:58.951 --> 43:00.869
I think he passed the test.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.955
Yeah, good thing.

43:03.038 --> 43:04.665
{\an1}(laughs)

43:04.748 --> 43:05.791
Wait, what's going on here?

43:05.874 --> 43:07.543
Boyfriends are so hard

43:07.626 --> 43:09.837
{\an3}to train these days,
aren't they?

43:09.920 --> 43:13.382
You mean you two were in
on this together?

43:19.388 --> 43:20.723
(sighs)

43:20.806 --> 43:22.725
Okay, you got me.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.810
{\an3}So, does that mean
you're not mad at me?

43:24.893 --> 43:27.146
Mm-hmm.

43:27.229 --> 43:27.855
Not anymore.

43:27.938 --> 43:31.150
{\an3}Look, I'm sorry.
I love you.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.359
You know that.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.696
Yeah. I do.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.823
Come here.

43:41.452 --> 43:41.910
(all laughing)

43:41.994 --> 43:44.788
Sick... both of you.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.749
{\an3}Donna.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.751
{\an3}I've only got one more
question for you

43:48.834 --> 43:50.711
{\an3}and then we'll put this
whole "Senior Buddy" business

43:50.794 --> 43:53.172
out of its misery.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.882
{\an1}Yeah, what do you
want to know?

43:54.965 --> 43:57.968
Does Brandon Walsh
have a girlfriend?

43:59.970 --> 44:01.555
(clears throat)

44:01.638 --> 44:01.889
{\an1}(giggles)

44:08.854 --> 44:10.773
What's the matter, Kel?

44:10.856 --> 44:12.191
{\an3}Nothing.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.776
I'm fine.
Come on.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.277
{\an1}I know you better
than that.

44:15.361 --> 44:19.323
I'm just going
through a senior slump.

44:19.406 --> 44:20.949
And it's only been half a week.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.951
You know what I think?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.912
{\an3}What?

44:24.995 --> 44:28.540
I think you're lonely.
That's all.

44:30.542 --> 44:31.293
Hey, don't worry.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.754
{\an1}It'll be a great year
for both of us.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.214
You'll see.

44:35.297 --> 44:36.423
Yeah.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.801
We'll find you a guy.

44:38.884 --> 44:41.804
{\an3}One as great
as Dylan.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.931
Thanks, Bren.
