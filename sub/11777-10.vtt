back a little bit,

and then these musical notes,

09:25.398 --> 09:27.233
they just flattened
everything out.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.485
Sebastian.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.281
{\an5}-The skull Rock Navarro guitar.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.281
-Mm-hmm.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.657
It doesn't scream
"Dimension" to me,

09:34.740 --> 09:35.658
but I like the fact
that it's more graphic.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.868
You can recognize it
from across the room.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.538
I don't love it,
I don't hate it.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.958
Sarah, you started off,
you had, like, a cool pinup.

09:44.041 --> 09:44.792
What happened to her?

09:44.875 --> 09:45.835
It just was not coming together.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.921
I kind of went
in a very different direction.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.589
You missed the challenge
pretty heavily.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.134
I just don't like it.
As far as the spacing goes,

09:53.217 --> 09:55.011
I'm pretty over it,
and I don't think

09:55.094 --> 09:56.637
the dimension
really comes into play.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.930
There's not a lot to really say.

09:58.014 --> 09:58.889
It doesn't hit the challenge.

10:00.599 --> 10:03.102
[blows air]
This is a rough one, dude.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.353
I don't really like any of 'em.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.855
I feel like everybody
just kind of

10:05.938 --> 10:08.774
went to the go-to, easy stuff
that they've been doing.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.192
I like Jesse's the best.
It's painted the best.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.486
Jesse's got a great painting,

10:12.570 --> 10:13.779
but would you want to haul that
in front of an audience?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.407
I mean-- Sarah's is the worst.

10:16.490 --> 10:20.161
Tatu Baby's is really sloppy,
a little bit design-flawed.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.454
But it looks good from here.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.705
Sebastian's is kind of cheesy.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.706
{\an5}-It's a cartoon character.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.706
-It was just flat.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.499
{\an5}-Jamie's is, uh--

10:23.789 --> 10:25.499
-Jamie's is just weird.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.586
I just feel like
the go-to dark symbols

10:28.669 --> 10:29.879
aren't always skulls...

10:29.962 --> 10:31.130
{\an5}-Yeah.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.130
-And devils.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.175
But which is the less
of all the evils in your mind?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.968
{\an5}-I think we know.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.968
-There we go.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.261
[claps]

10:38.971 --> 10:42.391
For this Flash Challenge,
we tested you on dimension.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.394
Frankly...

10:45.478 --> 10:46.896
There's really nothing
that we loved here.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.817
Overall,
this is very disappointing.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.402
If it was me, I wouldn't want
to take any of these onstage.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.696
This sucks.
It's boring as [bleep].

10:58.074 --> 10:59.033
We're here to have a contest.

10:59.116 --> 11:02.578
Does anybody want
to [bleep] win this thing?

11:02.661 --> 11:04.246
You're acting
like we're not trying.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.583
Like, I'm trying. Everybody here
is trying, all of you guys--

11:07.666 --> 11:08.626
{\an5}-Like, I want--I know--

11:07.666 --> 11:08.626
-Dude, listen.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.252
Man, it's like
pulling [bleep] teeth.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.420
You could paint your ass off,

11:11.504 --> 11:12.755
but you're just painting
another one of your things,

11:12.838 --> 11:15.758
and Steve can paint,
but he's doing that thing.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.219
Every single thing, I don't give
a [bleep] what the medium is,

11:18.302 --> 11:21.097
we've seen it on other stuff.
You're recycling designs.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.765
How far outside of the box
do you expect us to go?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.476
I don't give a [bleep]
what box you go to.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.104
Any other box but the box
we've been in for [bleep] weeks.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.188
I think when the pressure's on,

11:29.271 --> 11:30.398
you go to what you know.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.732
It's gotta get better.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.234
I honestly was trying to
switch [bleep] up for you guys,

11:33.317 --> 11:35.444
and that's what you get.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.695
It's me trying to step
outside of the box. I'm sorry.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.614
{\an5}-And it's the best one.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.614
-But I'm saying, like--

11:38.697 --> 11:39.698
everybody else,
y'all [bleep] suck.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.081
Listen, let's get this
wrapped up and keep it moving.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.584
And the winner
of the Flash Challenge

11:51.001 --> 11:52.461
is Jesse.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.839
You now have the power

11:54.922 --> 11:57.550
to assign all human canvases
in the elimination tattoo.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.178
{\an8}Congratulations,
you are the best of the worst.

12:01.262 --> 12:01.971
There's no joy
in winning something

12:02.054 --> 12:03.931
<i>that they've already</i> <i>destroyed.</i>

12:05.891 --> 12:07.935
{\an8}It's not
"Do what you want" master.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.229
How you feeling right now?

12:10.312 --> 12:11.397
[retches]

12:11.480 --> 12:13.274
Damn, we just freakin' started.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.818
[music]

12:18.404 --> 12:20.156
It's kind of hard
to enjoy winning

12:20.239 --> 12:21.615
when they told you
you were the best of the worst.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.951
I thought everybody's
looked pretty damn [bleep] good.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.995
Ah, this is rough, man.
This ain't no bull[bleep].

12:26.078 --> 12:27.121
We're all accomplished artists.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.873
We know what the [bleep]
looks good.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.500
Everybody's pretty beaten down
by what the judges had to say.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.335
<i>We're trying to give them</i>
<i>what they want,</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:34.211
<i>and they're</i> <i>yelling at us for,</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:36.130
you know, not stepping
outside the box.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.174
I just feel like when I was
coming up as an artist,

12:38.257 --> 12:40.176
there were great artists
who did Japanese

12:40.259 --> 12:41.469
and great artists
that did traditional,

12:41.552 --> 12:43.345
and my interests were otherwise,

12:43.429 --> 12:45.764
so I just let them do that,
and I try to do what--

12:45.848 --> 12:47.016
something
a little bit different.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.476
And when something
new school came their way,

12:48.559 --> 12:49.310
they'd send it
to someone like you.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.686
You've got
your comic book artists,

12:50.769 --> 12:52.062
you've got
your graffiti artists,

12:52.146 --> 12:52.938
different styles of art,

12:53.022 --> 12:56.025
and most of 'em
usually specialize.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.151
And if you took
any of those guys

12:57.234 --> 12:58.944
and said
"Do 20 different styles,"

12:59.028 --> 13:01.280
you'd have the same situation
you got going on here.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.449
We all came here
because we all think...

13:03.532 --> 13:05.034
{\an5}-If you did--

13:03.532 --> 13:05.034
-...that we could do everything.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.119
We're all very diverse artists.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.038
We've been pushed
out of our comfort zone a lot.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.707
{\an5}-Way out of our comfort zone.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.707
-About over 50% of the time.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.042
I don't think
there's anybody in existence

13:13.125 --> 13:15.878
that could go through
the challenges that we're doing

13:15.961 --> 13:17.421
and do any [bleep] better
than we are.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.380
Why the [bleep]
are we even here?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.424
I don't know.
Send me the [bleep] home.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.764
[rock music]

13:33.729 --> 13:35.731
Welcome to this week's
elimination tattoo.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.566
We're testing dimension.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.568
Nail it, and you'll be
in the top five,

13:39.652 --> 13:40.611
and one week closer
to the 100 grand,

13:40.694 --> 13:43.447
a feature in <i> Inked Magazine,</i>

13:43.531 --> 13:45.866
and the title of Ink Master.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.535
Fail, and you're outta here.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.078
We're not your only critics.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.496
Each week, viewers at home
will vote for the tattoo

13:50.579 --> 13:52.623
that they think is the best,

13:52.706 --> 13:55.125
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.337
Today, we also have
a very special guest judge.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.757
He owns one of the first
tattoo shops in Massachusetts,

14:01.840 --> 14:05.594
and his philosophies are steeped
in the traditions of old ways.

14:06.512 --> 14:06.929
Forrest Cavacco.

14:08.514 --> 14:12.059
{\an5}-[bleep]

14:08.514 --> 14:12.059
-[applause]

14:13.185 --> 14:15.145
{\an8}Being a tattooer, it's my life.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.939
<i>You can't just dabble</i>
<i>in this thing.</i>

14:17.022 --> 14:19.483
You cannot get respect from me
if you're gonna be like that.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.819
<i>Forrest Cavacco's</i>
<i>been tattooing about 20 years.</i>

14:21.902 --> 14:23.779
<i>He's done every style</i>
<i>that there is.</i>

14:23.862 --> 14:26.365
{\an8}He's one of the foremost
experts in animal tattooing.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.783
[overlapping greetings]

14:27.866 --> 14:28.826
<i>For the guest judge</i>
<i>to be a tattoo artist,</i>

14:28.909 --> 14:30.452
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's a really good thing.</i>

14:30.536 --> 14:32.538
{\an8}It's one person
with a different viewpoint

14:32.621 --> 14:35.624
{\an8}that's really able
to understand what we do.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.750
{\an5}-Thanks for coming, man.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.750
-Thanks for coming, man.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.960
Thank you.

14:38.043 --> 14:38.836
<i>With the way that this</i>
<i>competition's been going, though</i>

14:38.919 --> 14:41.463
I really don't know
what to expect.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.965
That brings us to this week's
elimination tattoo.

14:44.717 --> 14:44.883
Animals.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.137
Oh, cool.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.472
<i>In an animal tattoo,</i>
<i>in order to create dimension,</i>

14:50.556 --> 14:52.516
{\an8}you have to have
lights and darks.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.767
<i>You have to blend it</i> <i>in a way</i>

14:53.851 --> 14:55.144
<i>that tricks the eye</i>
<i>into thinking</i>

14:55.227 --> 14:56.979
that it's no longer
a two-dimensional canvas.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.982
For indigenous people
around the world,

15:00.065 --> 15:02.067
animals have
extraordinary power.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.236
Animal totems, or spirit guides,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.446
can be messengers
and protectors.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.449
<i>I have a lot of experience</i>
<i>with animal tattoos.</i>

15:08.532 --> 15:09.533
{\an8}I'm feeling really confident.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.286
Animal tattoos are
one of the most popular designs

15:12.369 --> 15:13.495
done in tattoo shops today.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.459
You will have six hours to
tattoo an animal in any style.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.585
Even if it's still our style?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.753
You said you want to see
something different.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.547
Would we be better to try
to do something different?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.424
Jamie, if your client
wants black-and-gray,

15:25.507 --> 15:26.383
then that's what you have to do.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.676
So if I do new school,

15:27.760 --> 15:28.802
I'm probably
gonna get penalized for it.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.137
I'm getting the impression here

15:30.220 --> 15:31.930
that you guys want to see
something different out of us.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.642
How many times
have you done just your thing

15:34.725 --> 15:36.143
for as long as we've been here?

15:36.226 --> 15:39.938
It doesn't mean that I hate it,
it's just not going to win.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.400
There's no way you can be
Ink Master with one style.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.194
It breaks all definition.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.362
It is <i> Ink Master.</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:48.781
It's not "Independent,
do-what-you-want master."

15:48.864 --> 15:50.532
You have to do
13 different styles

15:50.616 --> 15:51.825
to get 100 grand.

15:51.909 --> 15:52.868
Scrap it out.

15:52.951 --> 15:53.702
{\an5}-The way it should be.

15:52.951 --> 15:53.702
-Yeah.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.454
Let's meet your canvases.

15:55.537 --> 15:59.416
[rock music]

16:01.835 --> 16:02.753
You guys may recognize
our first canvas.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.547
From TNA impact wrestling,
Jeff Hardy.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.550
{\an5}-[applause]

16:05.631 --> 16:08.550
-[bleep].

16:08.634 --> 16:12.137
{\an8}I'm tripping out.
It's Jeff [bleep] Hardy.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.098
Jeff wants an octopus.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.809
<i>I am known as</i>
<i>"The charismatic enigma."</i>

16:16.892 --> 16:18.644
{\an8}The octopus is pretty strange,

16:18.727 --> 16:20.062
{\an8}and that fits
right along with me.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.897
Next up,
we have Veronica over there.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.357
Veronica wants a Jaguar.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.902
Next, we got Josh.
Josh wants a wolf.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.947
And next to Josh, we have
Julian, who also wants a wolf.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.908
{\an8}I don't want another wolf
on another dark-skinned client.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.119
<i>I've had to do it</i>
<i>a couple times. I'm over it.</i>

16:35.202 --> 16:37.204
Kat would like a raccoon,

16:37.287 --> 16:41.250
and Nick? Nick wants
both a gorilla and a chimp.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.419
Jesse, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

16:43.502 --> 16:46.797
you now have the power
to assign all human canvases.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.507
The competition is stiff.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.093
Do what you can
to protect yourself.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.429
<i>I know the judges want to see</i>
<i>something different out of me,</i>

16:53.512 --> 16:55.180
{\an8}but I'm not worried
about getting kicked out

16:55.264 --> 16:56.807
{\an8}for doing a solid tattoo.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.599
{\an5}-Octopus, right?

16:56.890 --> 16:57.599
-Octopus, yeah.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.102
{\an5}-Inside leg.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.102
-Inside leg?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
{\an5}-You know what style you want?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
-Not really.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.021
{\an5}-No? You open to--

17:01.854 --> 17:03.021
-Any form of octopus.

17:03.105 --> 17:03.981
Open to anything? Cartoon?

17:04.064 --> 17:05.232
<i>I'm pretty confident</i> <i>that if</i>

17:05.315 --> 17:08.736
<i>Chris or Oliver</i>
<i>were in this competition,</i>

17:08.819 --> 17:11.029
they would be doing pretty much
exactly the same thing

17:11.113 --> 17:12.196
that all of us are doing.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.323
Do you know what style you want?

17:13.406 --> 17:14.450
{\an5}-Realistic.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.450
-Alright.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.285
Like, new school. Cartoon style.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.912
<i>Any time I get the opportunity</i>
<i>to draw something in my style</i>

17:18.996 --> 17:21.540
and do what I do,
I'm gonna take it.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.295
Canvases,

17:26.377 --> 17:27.588
one by one, please reveal

17:27.671 --> 17:29.214
the name
on the bottom of your skull.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.382
Jesse.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.217
Tatu Baby.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.677
Jamie.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.430
{\an8}And of course, I get
another [bleep] wolf.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.347
Not my day.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.516
Sarah.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.143
<i>I feel like Jesse</i>
<i>shafted me a little bit.</i>

17:41.226 --> 17:43.479
{\an8}This is definitely
the hardest piece out there.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.355
Sebastian.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.732
{\an5}-Steve.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.732
-My man.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.650
{\an8}I get the one
I totally didn't want:

17:48.734 --> 17:51.403
A new school tattoo.
This is a nightmare.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.780
You have the rest of the evening

17:52.863 --> 17:54.740
to consult
with your human canvas.

17:54.823 --> 17:58.827
Tomorrow, you'll have six hours
to complete your animal tattoo.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.163
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.750
Good luck.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.668
<i>To create dimension,</i>
<i>you really need</i>

18:06.752 --> 18:09.296
{\an8}the right proportion
and dark and light and contrast.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.507
<i>These artists</i>
<i>really need to be able</i>

18:11.590 --> 18:13.634
to make these creatures
come to life.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.178
So these are portfolios
of the type of work I do.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.596
My first objective
is to try to push you

18:17.679 --> 18:18.764
in the direction
of the stuff I do,

18:18.847 --> 18:20.808
'cause I think I can do
the best job of that.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.726
<i>I want to do this piece</i>
<i>in new school.</i>

18:22.810 --> 18:25.187
{\an8}The judges said that we
could do whatever style we want.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.564
It doesn't feel right
to do anything else.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.358
I want to, like, kind of
tweak it out a little bit,

18:29.441 --> 18:31.944
maybe have the octopus
strangling a couple of rabbits

18:32.027 --> 18:33.153
with their eyeballs popping out.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.029
<i>I've never been</i> <i>really a big</i>
<i>fan</i>

18:34.112 --> 18:36.824
{\an8}of the extremely
cartoonish tattooing,

18:36.907 --> 18:38.408
<i>but this is the way</i>
<i>he does things.</i>

18:38.492 --> 18:39.910
What do you think
about the head?

18:39.993 --> 18:40.828
{\an5}-Is this the eye right here?

18:39.993 --> 18:40.828
-That's his nose.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.622
What am I getting myself into?

18:44.748 --> 18:46.083
Are you set on new school?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.210
I was just kinda gonna
go with something different,

18:48.293 --> 18:50.212
new school, cartoon style,
'cause I don't have it.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.338
<i>Jesse [bleep] Me.</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:53.006
{\an8}He knows this is not my forte.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.591
I could do new school,
but I don't--

18:54.675 --> 18:56.343
{\an5}-I don't do it enough where...

18:54.675 --> 18:56.343
-Right.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.054
You know, I'd want to rock
a super-sick new school piece

18:59.137 --> 19:00.389
on you for six hours.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.558
I really got to get this guy
to go in a different direction.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.394
I'm gonna be honest with you,
that's not exactly what I do.

19:05.477 --> 19:09.648
How would you feel
about a lion instead of a wolf?

19:09.731 --> 19:11.066
Um, I'm pretty set on a wolf.

19:11.149 --> 19:14.278
My personality
caters to the wolf.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.445
I just want this to be, like,
the best tattoo out there.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.073
That's why I'm just, like,
shooting out suggestions.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.408
<i>A wolf</i> <i>is very generic.</i>

19:19.491 --> 19:21.660
{\an8}How can you
really impress the judges

19:21.743 --> 19:23.287
{\an8}if you're just doing a wolf?

19:23.370 --> 19:24.454
I am set on a wolf.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.915
[sighs]

19:26.999 --> 19:29.835
There is just no talking
this guy out of anything.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.169
Have you ever
done a wolf before?

19:31.253 --> 19:32.921
Yes, I have, but that's
not what they're looking for.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.049
If this guy
doesn't let me at least

19:36.133 --> 19:39.261
take some artistic liberties
with this, I'm going home.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.932
[music]

19:45.267 --> 19:46.143
<i>I've been criticized</i>
<i>for letting myself</i>

19:46.226 --> 19:48.437
get too emotional
when I'm under pressure.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.397
[groans]

19:50.480 --> 19:51.815
If I drop the ball
on this tattoo...

19:51.899 --> 19:53.775
<i>Mother [bleep]!</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:54.610
I'm going home.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.653
I don't know
if this is gonna work.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.156
I would--I would--I just
make the stencil in the back.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.782
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.658
I know how to [bleep]
make a stencil.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.703
I don't know
how to make it on this.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.246
{\an5}-I don't know.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.246
-[sighs]

20:06.330 --> 20:07.789
I would make a copy.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.833
Nope. I have a copy.

20:09.917 --> 20:10.751
[exasperated sigh]

20:10.834 --> 20:12.169
Sarah does not do well
under pressure.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.546
You want your stencil
to face the other way?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.591
No! No!

20:17.674 --> 20:20.510
I'm trying to get a stencil
on the back of this paper.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.345
{\an5}-Okay, I'm just saying.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.345
-Yeah.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.472
It's not a--
it's not a big deal.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.182
[scoffs]

20:25.265 --> 20:27.225
Sarah's going crazy in here!

20:27.309 --> 20:29.227
<i>I don't even try</i>
<i>to get in Sarah's mind.</i>

20:29.311 --> 20:30.604
{\an8}You know,
she's definitely crazy.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.231
This is-- this is not gonna--

20:33.315 --> 20:35.233
[exasperated sigh]

20:35.567 --> 20:39.738
[music]

20:42.699 --> 20:45.494
Today, you must create
an animal tattoo.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.372
Remember,
we're testing dimension.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.166
If that animal isn't
leaping off your canvas,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.417
you'll be going home.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.379
You have six hours to tattoo,

20:55.462 --> 20:58.465
and your time starts... Now.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.217
[music]

21:01.593 --> 21:03.011
Put your leg right there.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.097
{\an8}One of the things
about doing animal tattoos,

21:05.180 --> 21:06.682
<i>is it is something</i>
<i>that really exists,</i>

21:06.765 --> 21:08.684
<i>so therefore,</i>
<i>there are structures</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:09.726
<i>and rules</i> <i>and things to follow.</i>

21:09.810 --> 21:11.561
<i>You're not</i>
<i>just making something up.</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:12.604
<i>It's an animal.</i>

21:12.688 --> 21:14.272
If it's a fox,
it needs to look like a fox.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.524
{\an5}-Awesome.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.524
-[laughs]

21:15.607 --> 21:16.650
{\an8}At the end of the day,

21:16.733 --> 21:17.943
{\an8}these kids are here
for 100 grand.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.236
<i>It's about who can do</i>
<i>all things perfectly,</i>

21:19.319 --> 21:22.322
<i>and that's</i>
<i>a tough order to fill.</i>

21:22.406 --> 21:24.366
<i>I want these kids</i>
<i>to come out and shine.</i>

21:24.449 --> 21:25.826
Let's see what these kids got.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.327
This won't hurt a bit.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.663
{\an5}-[gasps] Oh, my God!

21:27.411 --> 21:29.663
-Yeah.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.708
<i>My canvas wants</i>
<i>a portrait style Jaguar,</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:33.583
{\an8}and I'm super stoked about it.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.836
It's perfect.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.754
<i>I'm gonna show</i>
<i>a lot of dimension.</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:40.882
This is the exact design
that I need to win.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.051
Hopefully, the pain
won't be that bad.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.387
[laughs] I don't want
to be "That girl."

21:52.811 --> 21:54.229
{\an8}To show the dimension
of the wolf,

21:54.312 --> 21:56.356
<i>I'm gonna have to have</i>
<i>a background</i>

21:56.440 --> 21:58.358
<i>that really makes it</i>
<i>pop off his skin.</i>

21:59.860 --> 22:01.361
{\an5}-No.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.361
-Oh.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.114
I feel like
I'm at a severe disadvantage,

22:04.197 --> 22:06.116
<i>but I'm just gonna execute this</i>
<i>to the best of my abilities,</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:09.911
and hope to God
that I impress them.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.834
{\an8}I finally get my hands
on some black-and-gray realism.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.211
My technical application
is this [bleep].

22:18.295 --> 22:19.337
This is what I do.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.674
I'm eliminating
any type of error in technique.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.676
I definitely aim to be applauded
on this [bleep] tattoo.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.470
This is easy.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.389
Okay, everybody,
five hours to go.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.603
Ugh. That's so unpleasant.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.272
I feel like a little bit
nauseous right now.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.900
I'm concerned.
Is it the pain, you know?

22:39.983 --> 22:42.069
You want me to just give you,
like, a little break?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.070
I could just stretch out
a minute.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.781
Damn, we just freakin' started.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.158
[sighs]

22:48.241 --> 22:49.785
<i>It's a little redundant</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

22:49.868 --> 22:51.161
<i>I've been stuck</i>
<i>with black-and-gray,</i>

22:51.244 --> 22:53.205
<i>I've been stuck</i>
<i>with these hairy creatures.</i>

22:53.288 --> 22:54.831
I want to try
to do something different,

22:54.915 --> 22:56.875
<i>something that</i>
<i>not only interests me</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:59.044
but just is not boring
to the judges.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.629
Oh, you got a tough wolf.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.880
That's mean.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.048
You gonna put blood in it?

23:03.131 --> 23:04.299
Thought about it.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.802
<i>I don't like the fact that Jamie</i>
<i>doesn't have tattoos.</i>

23:06.885 --> 23:08.637
<i>Every one of us</i> <i>wears the mark.</i>

23:08.720 --> 23:11.348
We all get tattooed because
we love it and we believe in it.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.726
{\an8}How can you be a
tattooer and not have tattoos?

23:14.810 --> 23:16.144
<i>If you're gonna be a tattooer,</i>
<i>you have to have tattoos.</i>

23:16.228 --> 23:19.272
I can't respect
not having tattoos.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.985
<i>Everybody</i> <i>in the competition</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:27.114
is doing more of
a realistic-type animal,

23:27.197 --> 23:28.532
<i>and I'm doing</i>
<i>what I normally do.</i>

23:28.615 --> 23:30.951
<i>I've gone back to doing</i>
<i>a new school piece.</i>

23:31.034 --> 23:32.452
How's this coming along?

23:32.536 --> 23:33.495
That looks awesome.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.163
We'll see what the judges say.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.331
{\an8}They're probably
gonna hate me for it.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.499
<i>I don't think</i> <i>I'm rebelling.</i>

23:37.582 --> 23:40.293
I think I'm doing
what any artist would do

<i>in this particular</i> <i>position.</i>

<i>squeezing</i>
<i>another little furry creature.</i>

How the [bleep]
are you an Ink Master

23:46.758 --> 23:48.176
<i>if you can only do</i>
<i>Jesse Smith tattoos?</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:50.470
I think it's bull[bleep].

[rock music]

23:54.141 --> 23:55.225
How you feeling right now?

23:55.308 --> 23:57.853
I'm, like,
really dizzy right now.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.897
My canvas,
she's just not feeling well.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.358

{\an5}-Ugh!

24:08.071 --> 24:10.031
-Try and relax.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.367
I'm just nauseous and I'm dizzy.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.536

right now at all.

Ugh. Ugh.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.918
You think you're gonna throw up?

24:22.002 --> 24:25.505
Why is this happening to me
right now?

24:46.359 --> 24:48.904
{\an5}-She's in trouble.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.904
-Oh, my God.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.906
It really, really sucks.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.117
<i>If my canvas doesn't let me</i>
<i>finish this tattoo,</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:56.244
I'm going home.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.956
Ugh!

25:03.210 --> 25:04.211
What happened to the chimp?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.296
He's covered in black-and-gray.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.756
{\an5}-Man--

25:06.379 --> 25:07.756
-I said, "I can do new school,

25:07.839 --> 25:09.841
but look at my portfolio.
What do you think?"

25:09.925 --> 25:11.885
Now that I got my human canvas
in a different direction,

25:11.968 --> 25:13.011
I'm feeling good.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.388
<i>I'm spending a ton of time</i>
<i>on the hair</i>

25:15.472 --> 25:16.890
<i>to show</i> <i>super dimension.</i>

25:16.973 --> 25:19.601
<i>They want detail, they want</i>
<i>line work, they want shadows.</i>

25:19.684 --> 25:22.270
I'm doing everything I can do
to show that I'm an Ink Master.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.439
That's gonna be [bleep] badass.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.150
[bleep] Yeah.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.069
<i>Jamie's been tattooing</i>
<i>for 17 years.</i>

25:29.152 --> 25:31.238
He's a kick-ass artist.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.281
It's really [bleep] tight.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.658
<i>If Jamie</i> <i>nails this wolf,</i>

25:34.741 --> 25:36.618
it's gonna blow my wolf
out of the water.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.327
That looks sick.
I really wish my guy

25:37.410 --> 25:39.246
would let me do a snarling wolf.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.123
The pressure is enormous.

25:42.207 --> 25:46.336
<i>Sarah puts a really big,</i>
<i>black, ugly tribal mess</i>

25:46.419 --> 25:47.963
<i>on the right side</i> <i>of this wolf.</i>

25:48.046 --> 25:49.673
It's a big, unnecessary
dark splotch

25:49.756 --> 25:51.633
<i>that looks like a cover-up.</i>
<i>If I was Sarah,</i>

25:51.716 --> 25:54.094
I'd be very concerned that
that's gonna be her trip home.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.720
I'm gonna go in here
and in here,

25:55.804 --> 25:57.472
and just, like, tighten it up
just a smidge,

25:57.555 --> 26:00.183
but, like, [bleep]
15 minutes' worth of work.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.644
Ten more minutes, everybody.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.105
How you feeling? You feel like
you could do a little bit more?

26:05.188 --> 26:07.857
<i>As time is ticking down,</i>
<i>I'm trying to finish</i>

26:07.941 --> 26:09.985
the rest of this tattoo
as fast as I can.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.028
Will you ever do
another five-hour tattoo?

26:12.112 --> 26:12.779
Hell, no.

26:12.862 --> 26:17.993
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

26:18.076 --> 26:18.994
{\an5}-five, four...

26:18.076 --> 26:18.994
-Mm!

26:19.077 --> 26:22.914
Three, two, one.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.001
Time. That's it.
Machines down. No more ink.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.711
[sighs] Oh.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.172
Oh, that's nice.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.133
Wow.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.509
Definitely
what I was looking for.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.927
Oh!

26:36.011 --> 26:37.971
I mean, I like it
for what it is.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.432
I am so frickin' upset.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.685
Like, words cannot explain
how I'm feeling right now.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.396
<i>I know that having</i>
<i>an unfinished tattoo</i>

26:46.479 --> 26:48.315
<i>is going to send me home.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

26:48.398 --> 26:49.774
It's done. Bye-bye, Tatu Baby.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.195
{\an8}Who the [bleep] are you?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.780
{\an8}I've been doing this
[bleep] for 17 years.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.032
{\an8}I have earned my stripes.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.659
The excuses are B-O-L-O-G-N-A.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.704
{\an5}-Bull[bleep].

26:59.743 --> 27:02.704
-The excuses are Bologna.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.208
[music]

27:09.127 --> 27:10.795
What happened to your girl, man?

27:10.879 --> 27:12.589
I heard her throwing up
all over the place.

27:12.672 --> 27:15.633
She almost filled up
the whole bucket full of puke.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.426
For real?

27:16.509 --> 27:17.886
I lost an hour and a half.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.263
That's the hour and a half
that I so needed for that piece,

27:20.347 --> 27:22.849
and I just feel, like, scared

27:22.932 --> 27:25.393
that the judges are gonna
hold that against me.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.519
You couldn't finish the piece.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.189
What can you do? She did not
let me finish tattooing.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.232
Well, that's no excuse.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.276
{\an8}Tatu Baby's tattoo,
it's not done yet,

27:33.360 --> 27:34.235
<i>so at this point,</i>

27:34.319 --> 27:36.529
if you don't finish,
you're going home.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.822
It just sucks.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.699
I really wanted to finish
that [bleep] Jaguar.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.871
[rock music]

27:48.666 --> 27:50.794
[dramatic music]

27:57.258 --> 28:00.053
This week, we asked you
to create an animal tattoo.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.388
We're testing dimension.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.890
Jesse, you're up first.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.893
Here we go.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.855
You went
with your new school style.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.941
A lot of my difficulty
in this competition

28:13.024 --> 28:15.235
is trying to separate
impressing the judges

28:15.318 --> 28:16.903
and putting
my best foot forward.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.406
Strategically, I probably
didn't make the best decision.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.117
This is not my favorite style
of tattooing.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.369
It's yours,
but you used good dimension,

28:24.452 --> 28:26.579
and you did a really clean job.

28:26.663 --> 28:27.872
There's things I like about it.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.041
Judging dimension, there are
some areas in this tattoo

28:30.125 --> 28:32.085
where you really
give this thing little tricks.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.587
The bulges of the eyes and
the little texture of the skin

28:34.671 --> 28:36.923
where it bulges out,
that stuff looks great.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.466
There's things
I don't like about it.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.968
Some of the elements
where you could have shown

28:40.051 --> 28:42.720
a drastic amount of dimension
is in the bottom,

28:42.804 --> 28:43.972
where these tentacles
are flowing

28:44.055 --> 28:45.265
back and forth over each other,

28:45.348 --> 28:46.683
it just gets a little lost.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.685
In the initial conception
of this tattoo,

28:48.768 --> 28:50.145
it's got some design flaws.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.357
Steve.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.652
This tattoo is solid.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.320
It has
all the right skin breaks.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.572
This is what I want to see.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.074
This one's much better
than the last one.

29:03.158 --> 29:03.992
The detail is unbelievable.

29:04.075 --> 29:04.868
The way the shoulder is turned,

29:04.951 --> 29:07.078
and you kept it light
up in the front,

29:07.162 --> 29:07.996
you really got dimension.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.124
This is exactly
why I am the way I am.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.501
When I give you so much [bleep],
it's 'cause you can do this.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.919
Maybe some of my ideas
don't work as well as others,

29:15.003 --> 29:18.548
but some of 'em, you just have
such a solid idea, and it works.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.550
{\an5}-Great [bleep] job.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.550
-Thank you.

29:24.929 --> 29:25.847
Sebastian.

29:27.765 --> 29:28.641
So you've got

29:28.725 --> 29:29.601
{\an5}-the raccoon in the tree.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.601
-[laughs]

29:29.684 --> 29:31.895
That's what she wanted.
She didn't want

29:31.978 --> 29:33.730
a raccoon climbing a tree
or hanging off a tree.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.398
She wanted it actually
poking his head out.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.859
I went, "Oh, well, [bleep]!"

29:37.942 --> 29:39.360
The way this tattoo is done,

29:39.444 --> 29:41.946
technically, this is the kind of
tattoo that is gonna age well,

29:42.030 --> 29:44.741
it's gonna look better
when these soft grays tone out.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.701
Let's talk about dimension
in this tattoo.

29:46.784 --> 29:49.496
I believe that it is
coming out of a hollow tree.

29:49.579 --> 29:52.207
The top of that bark
where the ears are,

29:52.290 --> 29:54.042
the way that you gave it
that thickness,

29:54.125 --> 29:57.212
that really gives this tattoo
that little bit of dimension

29:57.295 --> 29:58.880
that we're looking for.
I would love

29:58.963 --> 30:01.674
to see you put some real hair
in your repertoire

30:01.758 --> 30:04.844
to make the tattoo look cute
and cuddly, instead of grainy.

30:04.928 --> 30:05.553
I'm not that great at composing

30:05.637 --> 30:08.097
all the swoopy, swirly things.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.601
It was a raccoon.
It's, like, grainy hairs, man.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.770
But that's the move. That's
where you bust those hairs out,

30:13.853 --> 30:15.980
and everybody goes,
"Holy [bleep], wow!"

30:18.191 --> 30:20.276
Sarah.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.782
When I went into the tattoo,
I tried to take my time.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.243
I wanted that contrast
so that you could see

30:28.326 --> 30:29.911
the really, really dark
to the really, really light.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.579
I really liked the wispy edges,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.122
and the way the thing trails off

30:33.206 --> 30:34.916
and gives this tattoo
some motion,

30:34.999 --> 30:36.125
but what I don't like

30:36.209 --> 30:39.337
is the big area of black
above his ear.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.755
When you see this tattoo
in person,

30:40.838 --> 30:43.633
it really obstructs
and hides your view

30:43.716 --> 30:46.135
of the perimeter of this wolf,
which gives it the shape.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.971
That was basically
kind of a design element.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.391
I wanted the ambient lighting
from the wolf's being outside.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.309
I can't stop
looking at that cover-up area.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.978
That's hurting you there.
It's just awfully dark.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.479
It definitely looks
like you're covering,

30:56.563 --> 30:58.147
like, an old tribal tattoo,
or something.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.775
The left side of the tattoo
is incredible.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.569
You showed
that you can do the hair.

31:02.652 --> 31:03.736
That's the hardest trick,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.030
and then the right side,
it's just the black behind it.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.365
Why did you stop doing the hair?

31:07.448 --> 31:09.284
I obviously know what I'm doing.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.744
I wanted to try
a different technique on this.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.121
Backgrounds can murder you.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.414
If that background fumbles,

31:14.497 --> 31:15.540
at this stage of where we are,

31:15.623 --> 31:16.583
that can cost you.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.004
Jamie.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.591
Are you feeling confident
about this?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.259
You guys said you wanted
to see something different,

31:26.342 --> 31:27.093
and I've already done
two wolves,

31:27.176 --> 31:28.219
{\an8}and I just tried
to turn the corner

31:28.303 --> 31:31.139
and do it different
than I had done the other ones,

31:31.222 --> 31:32.307
just for a change.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.475
{\an8}How much dynamics
you put in the nose,

31:34.559 --> 31:36.769
the teeth, and these eyes
make this thing strong,

31:36.853 --> 31:38.896
but then his forehead,
and this bridge,

31:38.980 --> 31:40.064
and the shoulders,
and all that stuff

31:40.148 --> 31:41.899
is just so muted.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.402
This guy has a huge area
of his forearm

31:44.485 --> 31:46.571
that's just kinda
wishy-wash gray shading

31:46.654 --> 31:48.656
that doesn't have
any real dimension

31:48.740 --> 31:50.158
that makes this wolf
pop off that arm.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.327
I feel like today,
you just got out-tricked.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.912
I know that you can do fur.
Why didn't you do that today?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.831
That darker skin
was killing me a little bit,

31:56.914 --> 31:58.541
and I was just really working
to get the image readable.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.668
I like the tattoo a lot.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.961
This wolf
is pretty fierce-looking,

32:02.045 --> 32:03.171
but I need you to do me a favor.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.340
Get some tattoos.
If you want to be respected

32:05.423 --> 32:06.758
as a tattooer in the business,

32:06.841 --> 32:07.884
you need some tattoos.
Oh, I'm working on it.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.594
I honestly want to do
the sleeves and back

32:09.677 --> 32:11.846
all at once. I'll wait and get

32:11.929 --> 32:13.514
exactly what I want,
how I want it.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.516
In tattooing people,
you gotta know what it's like

32:15.600 --> 32:17.810
and what it feels like
and experience it so you know.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.772
I understand, I have 17 years
of Karmic Retribution, so--

32:20.855 --> 32:22.899
17 years of waiting.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.859
17 years you say you're
waiting for the right moment.

32:24.942 --> 32:27.528
When the [bleep]
is that gonna happen?

32:27.612 --> 32:28.237
Well, I've said,
I--I've--I've got--

32:28.321 --> 32:30.823
the excuses are B-O-L-O-G-N-A.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.743
{\an5}-Bull[bleep].

32:30.907 --> 32:33.743
-The excuses are Bologna.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.037
Get some tattoos real soon.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.249
Tatu Baby.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.295
How are you, doll?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.505
I'm still kinda stressed.

32:45.588 --> 32:46.881
I didn't get to finish
the tattoo,

32:46.964 --> 32:48.925
like, I didn't get to do
everything I wanted to do.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.551
I'm just nauseous and I'm dizzy.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.470
Like, I don't feel good
right now at all.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.097
Oh, God. [retches]

32:54.180 --> 32:58.351
I had about an hour left
when she felt better.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.311
We know what happened.
It's unfinished.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.979
For your sake,
enough of this tattoo got done

33:02.063 --> 33:06.317
for us to judge what we need
to see here today.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.443
The little textures of the fur,

33:07.527 --> 33:10.530
where you can tell the direction
of the little hairs,

33:10.613 --> 33:11.989
the way you put the solid black
where it needs to be,

33:12.073 --> 33:15.368
the multi-colors you use
to show dimension

33:15.451 --> 33:16.828
is really, really nice.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.038
You had so much opposition
from your client being sick.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.958
You pulled off all kinds
of cool tricks in here.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.252
I definitely didn't want
to give you a boring tattoo.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.087
The white highlights
were key for you.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.255
The green eyes are beautiful.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.215
I cannot believe
this is the same person

33:29.298 --> 33:32.009
that did the first tattoo
on [bleep] week one.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.012
Holy [bleep]! You have
turned it around immensely.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.931
{\an5}-[laughing] Really?

33:35.096 --> 33:36.931
-I'm happy to see

33:37.014 --> 33:38.266
that you did this quality job.
It's really nice.

33:38.349 --> 33:41.018
[chuckles]

33:45.231 --> 33:46.733
Nobody's going home for doing
a [bleep] tattoo today.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.652
Whoever goes home
got out-tricked.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.779
Keep fighting,
and every tattoo you guys do,

33:51.863 --> 33:53.281
put everything you have into it,

33:53.364 --> 33:54.031
like the whole career
is on the line.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.327
All right, guys.
Head back to the loft.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.663
We'll call you back
when a decision has been made.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.124
[dramatic music]

34:05.793 --> 34:08.004
Who else doesn't have tattoos?

34:08.087 --> 34:10.465
I think it is funny
that people that preach so much

34:10.547 --> 34:12.132
for being judged
for their tattoos

34:12.216 --> 34:13.134
and how they don't fit
into society

34:13.217 --> 34:15.052
and people pre-judge them
for how they look,

34:15.136 --> 34:17.638
will turn around
and do the exact same thing

34:17.722 --> 34:18.889
{\an5}-back to me because I--

34:17.722 --> 34:18.889
-Don't have any.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.141
{\an8}Personal prejudice
does come into play.

34:21.225 --> 34:24.395
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that Jamie did the worst tattoo</i>

34:24.478 --> 34:25.646
<i>of the day,</i> <i>but I don't think</i>

34:25.730 --> 34:27.315
<i>I did the worst tattoo</i>
<i>of the day either.</i>

34:27.398 --> 34:28.149
I think that Jamie's in trouble.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.318
You don't have any tattoos
at all?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.027
It's definitely
a question that I get asked

34:32.110 --> 34:33.821
every [bleep] day of my life.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.572
I'm straight up irritated
by the question.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.574
I completely understand,
like, wanting to wait.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.867
I like nice things.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.911
I have nice cars,
I have a nice house.

34:40.995 --> 34:44.165
I have no problem waiting until
I can get exactly what I want.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.958
{\an8}He's a tattoo artist
with no tattoos.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.210
That's kinda [bleep] up.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.920
I only have
the one visible tattoo.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.172
You've got one that shows,

34:51.255 --> 34:52.005
and that's enough
to break the stigma

34:52.089 --> 34:53.925
where you don't
have to deal with

34:54.007 --> 34:55.009
being questioned
by tattoo artists

34:55.092 --> 34:58.513
as though I have
no business tattooing.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.556
It's not that
I don't have tattoos

35:00.640 --> 35:02.558
because I don't want to be
tattooed.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.684
I'm willing to wait
as long as I have

35:03.768 --> 35:06.020
to get what I really want.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.898
From the second I saw you,
I was like, "Are you serious?"

35:08.981 --> 35:10.691
You don't have
no [bleep] tattoos.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.527
Let's see how good this guy is.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.694
Who the [bleep] are you?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.363
I've been doing this [bleep]
for 17 years.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.907
I have earned my stripes,
and I paid my [bleep] dues.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.495
[music]

35:26.123 --> 35:28.292
I'm in a bad [bleep] mood
right now.

35:28.376 --> 35:32.547
We've got Forrest and Oliver
yelling at me about no tattoos.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.756
That's just total bull[bleep].

35:33.840 --> 35:35.216
Shouldn't matter
whether you have tattoos or not,

35:35.299 --> 35:36.342
{\an5}-and if you don't--

35:35.299 --> 35:36.342
-I don't know why that even

35:36.425 --> 35:37.051
comes up
as part of the criteria.

35:37.134 --> 35:39.470
That--that I find ludicrous.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.555
I don't [bleep] care.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.139
It's inevitable
that Sarah and I are going down.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.560
All right, so what's
your fight if you go down, then?

35:45.643 --> 35:46.727
I think that I've been
more consistent.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.106
I'm overall a stronger,
more well-rounded tattoo artist.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.148
Is your tattoo
worse than Sarah's?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.527
I don't think so.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.570
I don't think so either.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.363
That black spot
can't be fixed on hers,

35:57.446 --> 35:58.865
and they said
it looks like a cover-up.

35:58.948 --> 35:59.949
That's the kiss of death.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.617
Oh, she's going downstairs
with me.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.161
I-I don't think
she's coming back.

36:04.328 --> 36:04.871
Worst tattoo was Sarah's.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.248
You'll be coming back.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.588
All right, guys, we got
some tough decisions here,

36:13.671 --> 36:15.756
because everybody did
really solid work.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.884
The kick in the ass
did not hurt anybody.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.135
They needed to hear...
I think so too.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.011
That they were sucking.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.762
First up, Steve's gorilla.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.764
It's a solid tattoo.
I like the black.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.391
I like the detail.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.351
For only being black
and a little bit of highlight,

36:27.435 --> 36:29.562
the amount of dimension
that comes through is immense.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.355
This tattoo
just really came together.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.816
Let's move it along.
The unfinished Baby piece.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.735
She's scared
of going home today.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.486
Yup.
I like that she pulled it off

36:37.570 --> 36:38.321
in all that opposition.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.781
She did [bleep]
that is honestly,

36:40.865 --> 36:41.574
like, magician [bleep].

36:41.657 --> 36:42.950
{\an5}-She's a fighter, man.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.950
-Yeah.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.328
Next up,
Jesse's new school octopus.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.662
He did a really good job
technically,

36:46.746 --> 36:48.873
and I think he showed dimension,
but I don't feel like

36:48.956 --> 36:50.082
he used
the space of the leg right,

36:50.166 --> 36:52.126
{\an5}-and it's hard to read.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.126
-It's a very confusing design.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.588
Speaking of design flaws,
worst of the day?

36:55.671 --> 36:56.631
Definitely, for me,
Sarah and Jamie.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.716
{\an5}-Yeah.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.716
-Yeah.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.468
Unanimous. Jamie did nothing

37:00.551 --> 37:01.677
but a big, [bleep] blob.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.804
Yeah, but Sarah also did
a big, black

37:03.888 --> 37:06.140
[bleep] blob of her own
on the guy's chest.

37:06.223 --> 37:07.808
Sarah did better
on the face of the wolf

37:07.892 --> 37:10.102
{\an5}-and the dimension.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.102
-I hate that chest tattoo.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.812
She did a cover-up
without a cover-up.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.189
{\an5}-Threw mark out of here for it.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.189
-If I had to have

37:13.272 --> 37:15.816
that wolf on my chest
or that wolf on my forearm,

37:15.900 --> 37:16.859
{\an5}-I would take that wolf...

37:15.900 --> 37:16.859
-I'd take the wolf--

37:16.943 --> 37:17.985
{\an5}-yeah, for sure.

37:16.943 --> 37:17.985
-On that chest

37:18.069 --> 37:19.320
{\an5}-any day of the [bleep] week.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.320
-For sure.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.949
{\an5}-You're saying she should stay?

37:19.403 --> 37:22.949
-That's my vote.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.116
That's my vote.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.744
Based on what you've seen,
who's got the bottom slot?

37:26.827 --> 37:28.162
{\an5}-Sarah.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.162
-I totally agree.

37:28.245 --> 37:29.497
Why don't you go get 'em,
and we'll hear

37:29.580 --> 37:30.748
what they have to say about it.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.669
All right, all right.
Collaboration time.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.419
Respect me now.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.421
This could be my saving grace.

37:43.010 --> 37:45.304
Man. All right, um,

37:45.388 --> 37:52.520
the judges want to see Sarah,
Steve, Jamie, and Baby.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.771
We'll see y'all in a little bit.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.443
[dramatic music]

38:07.952 --> 38:09.996
This week,
we're testing dimension.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.872
Tonight, there is a top two
and a bottom two.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.418
Steve and Tatu Baby,

38:15.501 --> 38:18.087
you were the top two.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.631
The judges have decided that
the best tattoo of the day...

38:20.715 --> 38:23.592
[music]

38:24.969 --> 38:27.054
Goes to Steve.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.515
This tattoo could've won
many different challenges

38:29.598 --> 38:32.309
here in this competition.
This thing is really strong.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.395
The detail was great.
The heavy black makes this thing

38:34.478 --> 38:37.732
really stand out.
Very, very nice tattoo, man.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.191
{\an5}-Thank you.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.191
-Tatu Baby.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.943
You did
a really nice tattoo today.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.319
You had a lot against you,

38:42.403 --> 38:43.988
and you pulled off
a lot of tricks

38:44.071 --> 38:45.656
in half the time
of everybody else.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.323
For that, we commend you.

38:49.493 --> 38:53.164
Jamie and Sarah,
you guys are the bottom two.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.416
Jamie, everybody
in the house did this?

38:55.499 --> 38:57.501
It's my little
<i>Ink Master two</i> collabo.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.211
I'm not feeling that one at all.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.337
Little bit of a mockery,

39:00.421 --> 39:01.380
what you're doing
with the drawings.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.090
It was not intended
as disrespect

39:03.174 --> 39:04.550
to you guys in any way.

39:04.633 --> 39:05.926
Forrest, thoughts for Jamie?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.261
Not too many.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.263
I do honestly feel
like I've been

39:09.346 --> 39:11.807
one of the more well-rounded,
more solid tattoo artists

39:11.891 --> 39:12.933
throughout this competition.

39:13.017 --> 39:13.934
And this is my first time
in the bottom.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.062
If you take this tattoo down
in percentages,

39:16.145 --> 39:18.272
30% has a good image in it.

39:18.355 --> 39:21.442
The other 70%
is just misused skin.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.944
I look at that huge area
from the eyes

39:24.028 --> 39:25.696
to the top of that,
do I want a huge area

39:25.780 --> 39:28.949
of half of my forearm
just nothingness?

39:29.033 --> 39:31.994
But I don't feel like
I did anything that's undoable.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.079
There's nothing you can do
about the cover-up

39:33.162 --> 39:35.581
on the outside of Sarah's piece.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.124
That's there no matter what.

39:37.208 --> 39:37.875
Sarah?

39:37.958 --> 39:39.126
I think I did a pretty good job

39:39.210 --> 39:42.046
showing what you guys were
looking for in this challenge.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.132
Showing dimension,
showing foreground, background.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.342
If your tattoo
looks like a cover-up,

39:46.425 --> 39:48.719
and it's not a cover-up,
that means that there's

39:48.803 --> 39:49.970
something you could've done
drastically different

39:50.054 --> 39:53.265
in the design of your tattoo
to make this a better tattoo.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.810
That's basically nit-picking.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.353
You had
one of your rougher days.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.647
The big, black field
is haunting you.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.609
The difference
between the four of y'all

40:03.692 --> 40:04.693
is a very small margin,

40:04.777 --> 40:06.821
and that in lies
a tough decision for the judges.

40:06.904 --> 40:07.863
The judges have decided.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.449
[dramatic music]

40:10.783 --> 40:12.868
Jamie,

40:12.952 --> 40:15.663
you do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.664
Jamie, I did not
want you to leave.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.000
My vote was not for you,
it was for Sarah.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.419
I got outweighed. I think
you've worked really hard,

40:22.503 --> 40:24.797
and you've shown
a lot of versatility.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.549
Nobody's leaving
because of a bad tattoo.

40:26.632 --> 40:27.842
Every time somebody leaves,

40:27.925 --> 40:29.844
we wonder what that person
would've done the next day,

40:29.927 --> 40:30.594
and we're definitely
gonna be wondering

40:30.678 --> 40:32.513
what you would've done tomorrow.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.266
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:36.767 --> 40:37.685
They said whoever
was Ink Master,

40:37.768 --> 40:39.895
it was gonna be
the most consistent person

40:39.979 --> 40:41.689
throughout the competition,
which was clearly me.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.025
They were not gonna let
the non-tattooed tattoo guy

40:45.109 --> 40:46.193
win <i> Ink Master.</i>
There's no [bleep] way.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.571
I didn't ask their opinion,
and I don't [bleep] care.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.073
I came here to be critiqued
on the tattoos that I did,

40:51.157 --> 40:53.451
not on my body
and what my decisions have been.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.660
[bleep] them.

40:57.371 --> 40:59.707

40:59.790 --> 41:01.292
{\an8}Wow! Oliver's tattooing.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.793
{\an8}All right, mother[bleep],
I can do it smaller and cleaner.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.628
{\an8}Bam.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.713
{\an8}<i>Steve is getting to be</i>

41:05.796 --> 41:06.881
{\an8}<i>a little overconfident.</i>

41:06.964 --> 41:07.464
{\an8}You're going down.

41:07.548 --> 41:08.340
{\an8}Women are just inferior.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.675
{\an8}That's why they're
not gonna win.

41:09.758 --> 41:12.386
{\an8}I'm gonna show them that
I know what I'm [bleep] doing.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.013
{\an8}They're young
and they can't take it.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.055
{\an8}That's why I bust 'em.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.140
{\an8}But realistically,

41:16.223 --> 41:17.391
{\an8}they could beat anybody here.

41:17.474 --> 41:18.392
{\an8}You totally [bleep] it up.

41:18.475 --> 41:20.269
{\an8}This is Sebastian's strong suit.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.104
{\an8}If there's one thing he
shouldn't drop the ball on,

41:22.188 --> 41:23.105
{\an8}it should be this.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.648
{\an8}Get the [bleep] outta here.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.150
{\an8}I'll just choke
the [bleep] out of him.

41:27.526 --> 41:30.404
