00:15.667 --> 00:18.333
<i>My name is Mary Alice Young.</i>

00:18.417 --> 00:21.417
<i>In this morning's paper,</i>
<i>you may come across an article</i>

00:21.542 --> 00:24.834
<i>about the unusual day I had last week.</i>

00:24.917 --> 00:28.458
<i>Normally, there's never anything</i>
<i>newsworthy about my life,</i>

00:28.542 --> 00:31.333
<i>but that all changed last Thursday.</i>

00:31.417 --> 00:35.166
<i>Of course, everything seemed</i>
<i>quite normal at first.</i>

00:35.250 --> 00:37.083
<i>I made breakfast for my family.</i>

00:39.083 --> 00:41.291
<i>I performed my chores.</i>

00:42.750 --> 00:45.458
<i>I completed my projects.</i>

00:46.500 --> 00:49.083
<i>I ran my errands.</i>

00:49.166 --> 00:53.375
<i>In truth, I spent the day</i>
<i>as I spent every other day,</i>

00:53.458 --> 00:59.834
<i>quietly polishing the routine of my life</i>
<i>until it gleamed with perfection.</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:06.875
<i>That's why it was so astonishing when</i>
<i>I decided to go to my hallway closet</i>

01:06.959 --> 01:11.709
<i>and retrieve a revolver</i>
<i>that had never been used.</i>

01:16.083 --> 01:20.583
<i>My body was discovered</i>
<i>by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber,</i>

01:20.667 --> 01:24.125
<i>who'd been startled</i>
<i>by a strange popping sound.</i>

01:24.208 --> 01:26.291
<i>Her curiosity aroused,</i>

01:26.375 --> 01:30.166
<i>Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason</i>
<i>for dropping in on me unannounced.</i>

01:33.083 --> 01:35.333
<i>After some initial hesitation,</i>

01:35.417 --> 01:40.834
<i>she decided to return the blender she</i>
<i>had borrowed from me six months before.</i>

02:02.625 --> 02:06.625
It's my neighbor. I think she's been
shot. There's blood everywhere.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.625
Yes, you've got to send an ambulance.

02:09.709 --> 02:12.583
You've got to send one right now.

02:16.333 --> 02:20.625
<i>And, for a moment, Mrs. Huber</i>
<i>stood motionless in her kitchen,</i>

02:20.709 --> 02:23.709
<i>grief-stricken</i>
<i>by this senseless tragedy.</i>

02:23.834 --> 02:26.417
<i>But only for a moment.</i>

02:26.542 --> 02:29.291
<i>If there was one thing</i>
<i>Mrs. Huber was known for,</i>

02:30.083 --> 02:33.208
<i>it was her ability</i>
<i>to look on the bright side.</i>

02:39.834 --> 02:42.291
<i>I was laid to rest on a Monday.</i>

02:42.375 --> 02:45.500
<i>After the funeral,</i>
<i>all the residents of Wisteria Lane</i>

02:45.583 --> 02:48.458
<i>came to pay their respects.</i>

02:48.583 --> 02:52.750
<i>And, as people do in these situations,</i>
<i>they brought food.</i>

02:52.834 --> 02:55.417
<i>Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.</i>

02:55.500 --> 02:58.583
<i>Lynette had a great family recipe</i>
<i>for fried chicken.</i>

02:58.667 --> 03:02.291
<i>She didn't cook much</i>
<i>while moving up the corporate ladder.</i>

03:02.417 --> 03:04.125
<i>She didn't have the time.</i>

03:04.208 --> 03:08.750
<i>But when her doctor announced she was</i>
<i>pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.</i>

03:08.834 --> 03:10.583
<i>"Why not quit your job?"</i>

03:10.667 --> 03:15.125
<i>"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.</i>
<i>It would be so much less stressful."</i>

03:15.250 --> 03:17.208
<i>But this was not the case.</i>

03:17.291 --> 03:20.375
<i>In fact, Lynette's life</i>
<i>had become so hectic</i>

03:20.458 --> 03:24.583
<i>she was now forced to get her chicken</i>
<i>from the fast-food restaurant.</i>

03:24.667 --> 03:28.375
<i>Lynette would've appreciated the irony</i>
<i>if she'd thought about it.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:30.542
<i>But she didn't have the time.</i>

03:30.625 --> 03:32.875
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- But, Mom.

03:32.959 --> 03:35.125
No. You are going to behave today.

03:35.208 --> 03:38.542
I am not going to be humiliated
in front of the entire neighborhood.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.542
And, just so you know
how serious I am...

03:41.625 --> 03:44.834
- What's that?
- Santa's cell-phone number.

03:44.917 --> 03:46.709
How did you get that?

03:46.792 --> 03:49.625
I know someone
who knows someone who knows an elf.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.625
And if any of you acts up,
so help me, I will call Santa

03:52.750 --> 03:56.667
and I will tell him
you want socks for Christmas.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.875
Are you willing to risk that?

04:00.375 --> 04:04.625
OK. Let's get this over with.

04:07.834 --> 04:12.750
<i>Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block</i>
<i>brought a spicy paella.</i>

04:13.417 --> 04:17.250
<i>Since her modeling days in New York,</i>
<i>Gabrielle had developed a taste</i>

04:17.333 --> 04:19.709
<i>for rich food</i>

04:19.834 --> 04:22.000
<i>and rich men.</i>

04:22.792 --> 04:25.500
<i>Carlos, who worked in mergers</i>
<i>and acquisitions,</i>

04:25.583 --> 04:27.417
<i>proposed on their third date.</i>

04:27.500 --> 04:30.834
<i>Gabrielle was touched</i>
<i>when tears welled up in his eyes.</i>

04:30.917 --> 04:35.583
<i>But she soon discovered this happened</i>
<i>every time Carlos closed a big deal.</i>

04:35.667 --> 04:38.500
<i>Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.</i>

04:38.583 --> 04:43.000
<i>However, her relationship with</i>
<i>her husband was considerably cooler.</i>

04:43.125 --> 04:45.417
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,

04:45.500 --> 04:47.917
mention how much
I paid for your necklace.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.125
Why not pin the receipt to my chest?

04:50.208 --> 04:53.208
He let me know what he paid
for his wife's convertible.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.417
- Just work it in.
- There's no way I can.

04:55.542 --> 04:59.709
Why not? At the Donahue party
everyone was talking mutual funds.

04:59.792 --> 05:03.041
You mentioned
you slept with half the Yankee outfield.

05:03.125 --> 05:05.792
It came up
in the context of the conversation.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.208
People are staring.
Keep your voice down.

05:08.333 --> 05:11.625
Absolutely. We wouldn't want them
to think we're not happy.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.250
<i>Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door,</i>

05:14.375 --> 05:17.208
<i>brought baskets of muffins</i>
<i>she baked from scratch.</i>

05:17.333 --> 05:22.208
<i>Bree was known for her cooking.</i>
<i>And for making her own clothes.</i>

05:22.959 --> 05:25.125
<i>And for doing her own gardening.</i>

05:25.709 --> 05:29.166
<i>And for re-upholstering</i>
<i>her own furniture.</i>

05:29.250 --> 05:33.000
<i>Yes, Bree's many talents were known</i>
<i>throughout the neighborhood.</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:37.750
<i>Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought</i>
<i>of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.</i>

05:37.875 --> 05:41.709
<i>Everyone, that is,</i>
<i>except her own family.</i>

05:44.458 --> 05:46.750
Paul. Zachary.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.959
- Hello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- You shouldn't have.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.250
It was no trouble. The basket
with the red ribbon is for your guests.

05:54.375 --> 05:57.333
The one with the blue ribbon
is for you and Zachary.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.333
It's got rolls, muffins,
breakfast type things.

06:00.417 --> 06:01.667
Thank you.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.542
The least I could do
was give you a decent meal

06:04.625 --> 06:06.458
to look forward to in the morning.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.250
I know you're
out of your minds with grief.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.583
Yes, we are.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.625
I will need
the baskets back once you're done.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.375
Of course.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.583
<i>Susan Mayer,</i>
<i>who lives across the street,</i>

06:24.667 --> 06:26.834
<i>brought macaroni and cheese.</i>

06:26.959 --> 06:30.125
<i>Her husband, Karl,</i>
<i>always teased her about her macaroni,</i>

06:30.208 --> 06:34.625
<i>saying it was the only thing she knew</i>
<i>how to cook and she rarely made it well.</i>

06:35.166 --> 06:38.625
<i>It was too salty the night</i>
<i>she and Karl moved into their house.</i>

06:39.458 --> 06:42.959
<i>It was too watery the night</i>
<i>she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.</i>

06:44.083 --> 06:48.458
<i>She burned it the night Karl told her</i>
<i>he was leaving her for his secretary.</i>

06:56.291 --> 06:58.750
<i>A year had passed since the divorce.</i>

06:58.834 --> 07:02.458
<i>Susan had started to think it would</i>
<i>be nice to have a man in her life.</i>

07:02.542 --> 07:04.959
<i>Even one who would</i>
<i>make fun of her cooking.</i>

07:05.041 --> 07:08.208
Mom, why would
someone kill themselves?

07:09.625 --> 07:12.834
Well, sometimes people are so unhappy,

07:12.959 --> 07:16.000
they think that's the only way
to solve their problems.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.750
- Mrs. Young always seemed happy.
- Yeah.

07:18.834 --> 07:23.375
Sometimes people pretend to be one way,
when they're totally different inside.

07:23.458 --> 07:28.000
Like how Dad's girlfriend always says
nice things, but we know she's a bitch.

07:28.083 --> 07:32.125
I don't like that word, Julie.
But, yeah, that's a great example.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.542
What's going on?

07:47.834 --> 07:50.583
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Susan.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.291
So what did Karl say
when you confronted him?

08:14.375 --> 08:19.333
You'll love this, he said, "It doesn't
mean anything. It was just sex."

08:19.458 --> 08:22.333
Ah, yes, page one
of the philanderer's handbook.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.583
Then he got this Zen look on his face
and said, "You know,

08:25.709 --> 08:28.917
most men live lives
of quiet desperation."

08:29.000 --> 08:31.166
- Tell me you punched him.
- No. I said,

08:31.250 --> 08:34.250
"What do most women lead?
Lives of noisy fulfillment?"

08:34.333 --> 08:37.500
- Good for you.
- Did he have to bang his secretary?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.166
I had that woman to brunch.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.333
An erect penis
doesn't have a conscience.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.000
Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.875
This is why I joined the NRA.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.542
When Rex started going
to those conferences,

08:49.625 --> 08:52.333
I wanted it in the back of his mind
that he had a wife

08:52.417 --> 08:54.834
with a loaded Smith and Wesson.

08:54.917 --> 08:58.166
Lynnie, Tom's always away.
Do you ever worry he might...?

08:58.250 --> 09:02.000
He's gotten me pregnant
three times in four years.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
I wish he was having sex
with someone else.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.208
So, Susan,
is he gonna stop seeing that woman?

09:13.458 --> 09:15.458
I don't know.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.291
I'm sorry, you guys, I just...

09:23.458 --> 09:25.959
I just don't know
how I'm gonna survive this.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.125
Listen to me.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.792
We all have moments of desperation.

09:33.583 --> 09:37.750
If we can face them head-on, that's when
we find out how strong we really are.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.667
Susan.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.917
I was just saying
Paul wants us to go over on Friday.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.625
He needs us to help
pack up Mary Alice's things.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.542
He can't face doing it by himself.

09:54.625 --> 09:58.500
- Sure. That's fine.
- Are you OK?

09:58.583 --> 10:02.417
Yeah. I'm just so angry.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.750
If Mary Alice was having problems,
she should've let us help her.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.709
What problems could she have had?
She was healthy,

10:09.834 --> 10:12.375
had a great home, a nice family.
Her life was...

10:12.458 --> 10:14.625
Our life.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.667
No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis,
we'd have known.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.834
She lives 50 feet away,
for God sakes.

10:21.959 --> 10:26.208
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must've been going on.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.959
- I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
- Why?

10:42.041 --> 10:44.500
I made it. Trust me.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.542
Hey, do you have a death wish?

10:48.625 --> 10:53.500
No, I just don't believe that anybody
can screw up macaroni and cheese.

10:54.709 --> 10:57.458
Oh, my God.

10:57.542 --> 11:01.166
How did you...? It tastes like
it's burnt and undercooked.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.542
Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.

11:06.917 --> 11:11.583
Thanks. I'm Mike Delfino. I just started
renting the Sims' house next door.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.333
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

11:14.417 --> 11:18.208
Mrs. Huber told me about you.
Said you illustrate children's books.

11:18.291 --> 11:22.500
I'm very big with the under-five set.
What do you do?

11:22.583 --> 11:26.458
Plumber. So if you ever have a clog...

11:27.750 --> 11:29.375
...or something.

11:33.291 --> 11:36.417
Now that everybody's seen
that I brought something,

11:36.542 --> 11:39.792
I should probably just throw this out.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.875
Ease up, you little vampire.

11:55.291 --> 11:59.125
Lynette, I've been looking
all over for you.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.667
Are you aware
of what your sons are doing?

12:01.792 --> 12:04.125
Cannonball.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.250
Stop.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.667
What are you doing? We are at a wake.

12:17.792 --> 12:22.417
- You said we could go in the pool.
- I said you could go by the pool.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.792
Do you have your swimsuits on?

12:24.875 --> 12:27.792
Yeah, we put 'em on ourselves
before we left.

12:27.917 --> 12:31.250
You three planned this? All right.
That's it. Get out.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.583
- No.
- No?

12:33.667 --> 12:37.542
I am your mother.
You have to do what I say. Come on.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.959
We want to swim and you can't stop us.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.667
Here.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.667
- No.
- Get out.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.417
Think I won't get in this pool
and just grab you? Get out.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.333
Get over here.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.917
All right, give me your arm.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.458
That's right. Get over here.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.917
Go. Move it.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.375
Out. Get out.

13:33.875 --> 13:38.667
Paul, we have to leave now.
Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.375
Go.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.834
<i>Lynette shouldn't have been</i>
<i>so concerned about my husband.</i>

13:45.917 --> 13:51.500
<i>He had other things on his mind.</i>
<i>Things below the surface.</i>

13:59.417 --> 14:03.500
<i>The morning after my funeral, my friends</i>
<i>and neighbors quietly went back</i>

14:03.583 --> 14:05.792
<i>to their busy, busy lives.</i>

14:06.917 --> 14:09.375
<i>While some did their cooking</i>

14:11.458 --> 14:14.208
<i>and some did their cleaning</i>

14:15.500 --> 14:17.583
<i>and some did their yoga</i>

14:18.250 --> 14:21.166
<i>others did their homework.</i>

14:21.250 --> 14:23.917
Hi...

14:24.041 --> 14:26.792
I'm Julie. I kicked my ball
into your backyard.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.959
Well, let's go round and get it. Stay.

14:32.834 --> 14:36.458
His wife died a year ago.
In LA there were too many memories.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.291
He's renting for tax purposes,
but will buy soon.

14:39.375 --> 14:42.500
- I can't believe you went over.
- I saw you flirting.

14:42.583 --> 14:46.291
Now you know he's single,
you can ask him out.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.125
Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.083
I don't even know
if I'm ready to date yet.

14:52.208 --> 14:56.375
You need to get back out there. How
long has it been since you've had sex?

14:58.959 --> 15:02.208
- Are you mad I asked you that?
- No, I'm trying to remember.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.542
I don't want to talk
about my love life.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.917
I wouldn't have said anything. Just...

15:08.000 --> 15:09.333
What?

15:10.125 --> 15:14.083
I heard Dad's girlfriend ask
if you'd dated anyone since the divorce.

15:14.166 --> 15:19.959
And Dad said he doubted it.
And then they both laughed.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.250
Hey, Susan.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.000
Hi, Mike. I brought you
a house-warming gift.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.667
I should've brought
something by earlier.

15:43.750 --> 15:46.750
- Actually, you're the first to stop by.
- Really?

15:46.834 --> 15:48.834
<i>- Susan knew she was lucky.</i>
- Well...

15:48.917 --> 15:51.750
<i>An eligible bachelor</i>
<i>had moved on to Wisteria Lane</i>

15:51.834 --> 15:53.792
<i>and she was the first to find out.</i>

15:53.875 --> 15:56.208
<i>She also knew that good news...</i>

15:56.333 --> 15:58.667
- Hello, there.
<i>- ...travels quickly.</i>

15:58.750 --> 16:03.125
<i>Edie Britt was the most predatory</i>
<i>divorcée in a five-block radius.</i>

16:04.208 --> 16:06.542
<i>Her conquests were numerous.</i>

16:08.709 --> 16:10.458
<i>Varied.</i>

16:12.208 --> 16:14.000
<i>And legendary.</i>

16:16.375 --> 16:19.875
Hi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting.

16:21.333 --> 16:25.125
You must be Mike Delfino.
Hi, I'm Edie Britt.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.083
I live over there.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.542
Welcome to Wisteria Lane.

16:30.125 --> 16:33.875
<i>Susan had met the enemy.</i>
<i>And she was a slut.</i>

16:33.959 --> 16:35.959
Thank you. What's this?

16:36.041 --> 16:39.917
Sausage <i>puttanesca.</i>
It's just something I threw together.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.959
Well, thanks, Edie.

16:42.041 --> 16:47.458
That's great. I'd invite you in,
but I was in the middle of something.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.583
- I'm late for an appointment.
- I just wanted to say hi.

16:50.709 --> 16:54.834
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>the race for Mike Delfino had begun.</i>

16:54.917 --> 16:57.917
<i>For a moment, Susan wondered</i>
<i>if her rivalry with Edie</i>

16:58.041 --> 16:59.667
<i>would remain friendly.</i>

16:59.750 --> 17:03.208
Oh, Mike, I heard you're a plumber.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.083
<i>But she was reminded that</i>
<i>when it came to men...</i>

17:06.208 --> 17:09.625
Could you stop by later
and take a look at my pipes?

17:09.709 --> 17:12.166
<i>- ...women don't fight fair.</i>
- Sure.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.917
Thanks.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.375
Bye, Susan.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.208
- You can't order me around.
- Gabrielle.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.583
No, I'm not going.

17:26.667 --> 17:29.750
Tanaka expects
everyone to bring their wives.

17:29.834 --> 17:33.208
Every time I'm around that man,
he tries to grab my ass.

17:33.291 --> 17:36.417
I made over 200,000
doing business with him last year.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.542
If he wants to grab your ass, let him.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.834
John.

17:49.917 --> 17:52.583
Mr. Solis, you scared me.

17:52.667 --> 17:55.417
Why is that bush there?
You were meant to dig it up.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.875
- I didn't have time.
- I don't want excuses.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.041
Just take care of it.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.333
I really hate the way you talk to me.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.667
And I hate that I spent $15,000
on your diamond necklace

18:08.750 --> 18:10.333
you couldn't live without.

18:10.458 --> 18:15.500
But I'm learning to deal with it. So can
I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow?

18:15.583 --> 18:19.583
John, we have bandages
top shelf in the kitchen.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.000
Thanks, Mrs. Solis.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.500
Fine, I'll go.

18:27.625 --> 18:31.166
But I'm keeping my back pressed
against the wall the entire time.

18:31.291 --> 18:36.083
See, now this is what
a marriage is all about. Compromise.

18:42.542 --> 18:46.458
- Is your finger OK?
- Yeah, it's just a small cut.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.667
Let me see.

19:04.417 --> 19:10.166
You know, Mrs. Solis,
I really like it when we hook up,

19:10.250 --> 19:13.458
but, you know,
I got to get my work done

19:13.542 --> 19:15.875
and I can't afford to lose this job.

19:18.208 --> 19:23.041
This table was hand-carved.
Carlos had it imported from Italy.

19:23.125 --> 19:26.917
It cost him $23,000.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.083
You want to do it
on the table this time?

19:30.208 --> 19:32.750
Absolutely.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.917
Why can't we ever have normal soup?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.458
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal
about basil purée.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.083
Once, can we have a soup
people have heard of?

19:56.208 --> 20:00.500
- Like French onion or navy bean?
- Your father can't eat onions.

20:00.583 --> 20:05.834
He's deathly allergic. And I won't even
dignify your navy bean suggestion.

20:05.917 --> 20:08.959
So, how's the osso bucco?

20:09.083 --> 20:12.166
- It's OK.
- It's OK?

20:12.875 --> 20:15.458
I spent three hours cooking this meal.

20:15.583 --> 20:19.583
How do you think it feels when you say,
"It's OK" in that sullen tone?

20:19.709 --> 20:23.041
Who asked you to spend three hours
on dinner?

20:25.375 --> 20:27.959
Excuse me?

20:28.041 --> 20:31.709
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work,
opens a can of pork and beans,

20:31.834 --> 20:33.875
they're eating, everyone's happy.

20:33.959 --> 20:37.375
- You'd rather I served pork and beans?
- Apologize now, I beg.

20:37.458 --> 20:41.291
Do you always have to serve cuisine?
Can't we just have food?

20:41.375 --> 20:43.375
- Are you doing drugs?
- What?

20:43.458 --> 20:45.500
Change in behavior
is a warning sign

20:45.583 --> 20:48.792
and you have been as fresh as paint
for the last six months.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.458
It explains why you're always
in the bathroom.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.834
- That is not what he's doing.
- Shut up.

20:53.959 --> 20:56.625
Mom, I'm not the one
with the problem here.

20:56.709 --> 20:59.792
You're the one acting like
she's running for Mayor of Stepford.

21:00.834 --> 21:04.000
Rex, seeing that
you're the head of this household,

21:04.083 --> 21:06.333
I'd appreciate you saying something.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.000
Pass the salt?

21:22.834 --> 21:24.417
<i>Three days after my funeral,</i>

21:24.500 --> 21:28.500
<i>Lynette replaced her grief</i>
<i>with a much more useful emotion.</i>

21:28.583 --> 21:29.667
<i>Indignation.</i>

21:29.792 --> 21:33.583
Tom, this is my fifth message
and you still haven't called me back.

21:33.667 --> 21:38.625
You must be having a lot of fun on
your business trip. I can only imagine.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.417
Guess what,
the kids and I want some fun too,

21:41.542 --> 21:45.291
so unless you call me back by noon,
we're getting a plane to join you.

21:45.375 --> 21:48.458
- Mom.
- Not now. Mommy's threatening Daddy.

21:48.542 --> 21:51.166
- Mom.
- No, I...

21:51.250 --> 21:54.542
- Where are your brothers?
- Noodles, my favorite.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.709
- Lynette Scavo?
- Crap.

22:03.792 --> 22:07.375
Natalie Klein. I don't believe it.

22:07.458 --> 22:13.542
- Lynette. How long has it been?
- Years. How are you? How's the firm?

22:13.625 --> 22:16.875
- Good. Everyone misses you.
- Yeah.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.333
We all say, if you hadn't quit
you'd be running the place now.

22:20.417 --> 22:22.834
Yeah, well.

22:22.917 --> 22:27.625
So how's domestic life?

22:27.709 --> 22:30.000
Don't you just love being a mom?

22:30.083 --> 22:34.417
<i>And there it was. The question</i>
<i>that Lynette always dreaded.</i>

22:34.542 --> 22:36.208
Well, to be honest...

22:36.291 --> 22:40.000
<i>For those who asked it,</i>
<i>only one answer was acceptable.</i>

22:40.083 --> 22:43.917
<i>So Lynette responded</i>
<i>as she always did. She lied.</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:46.834
It's the best job I've ever had.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.667
- You know what I don't get?
- What?

23:00.792 --> 23:02.667
Why you married Mr. Solis.

23:06.125 --> 23:11.917
Well, he promised to give me
everything I've ever wanted.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.166
- And did he?
- Yes.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.709
Then why aren't you happy?

23:20.417 --> 23:23.834
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

23:23.917 --> 23:28.333
So do you love him?

23:28.458 --> 23:29.875
I do.

23:29.959 --> 23:33.291
So then why are we here?
Why are we doing this?

23:33.375 --> 23:35.792
Because I don't want
to wake up one morning

23:35.875 --> 23:38.667
with a sudden urge
to blow my brains out.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.959
- Hey, can I have a drag?
- Absolutely not.

23:46.041 --> 23:49.667
You are much too young to smoke.

23:50.542 --> 23:55.041
How would you feel if I used your child
support payments for plastic surgery?

23:55.166 --> 23:58.583
Stop being nervous. You're asking him
to dinner. No big deal.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.333
You're right.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.250
Is that your project for school?

24:03.333 --> 24:06.583
In fifth grade I made
the White House out of sugar cubes.

24:06.667 --> 24:10.291
Stop stalling and go. Before
Mike figures out he can do better.

24:11.375 --> 24:15.166
Tell me again
why I fought for custody of you.

24:15.291 --> 24:19.458
- You were using me to hurt Dad.
- That's right.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.709
Oh, God.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.375
- Are you busy?
- No, not at all. What's up?

24:36.458 --> 24:41.709
Well, I just was wondering if

24:41.792 --> 24:44.542
there was any chance that you...

24:47.041 --> 24:49.458
I just wanted to ask if...

24:51.125 --> 24:53.125
- Edie.
- Hey, there, Susan.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.792
- What are you...?
- I was making ambrosia.

24:55.875 --> 24:59.667
and I made too much so I thought
I'd bring some over to Mike.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.625
- What's going on?
- Susan was asking me something.

25:09.583 --> 25:11.834
- I have a clog.
- Excuse me?

25:11.917 --> 25:14.959
- And you're a plumber, right?
- Yeah.

25:15.083 --> 25:18.667
- The clog's in the pipe.
- Yeah, that's usually where they are.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.417
- Well, I've got one.
- OK. Let me get my tools.

25:22.500 --> 25:26.166
Now? You want to come over now?
You have company.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.667
I don't mind.

25:27.750 --> 25:31.208
Just give me two minutes.
I'll be right over.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.709
That's it.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.834
- Stuff the hair down.
- I stuffed it.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.542
- It's not enough to clog it.
- Here. Look.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.667
Put in this peanut butter.

25:50.792 --> 25:53.417
And this cooking oil.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.125
- Mom...
- And these olives.

25:55.375 --> 25:57.458
It's not working.

25:58.333 --> 26:01.041
Oh, God. That's him.

26:01.125 --> 26:03.917
How am I gonna stop up the sink?

26:11.208 --> 26:13.834
Well, here's your problem.

26:13.917 --> 26:17.208
Somebody stuffed
a bunch of Popsicle sticks down here.

26:18.125 --> 26:22.667
I've told Julie a million times not to
play in the kitchen. Kids, you know.

26:28.333 --> 26:32.583
I'll go put in your orders and I'll be
back with your plates for the salad bar.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.792
Thank you.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.375
Andrew, Danielle, napkins. Thank you.

26:38.834 --> 26:43.291
They have video games. Can we go play
until our food gets here?

26:43.417 --> 26:47.667
- This is family time. I think...
- Go ahead and play.

26:56.834 --> 26:59.875
I know you think I'm angry
about coming here, but I'm not.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.083
The kids wanted a change of pace,
something fun.

27:03.166 --> 27:07.875
I get it. They'll want something
healthier tomorrow, though.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.208
- I'm thinking chicken saltimbocca.
- I want a divorce.

27:15.208 --> 27:20.583
I just can't live in this
detergent commercial anymore.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.750
The salad bar's there.
Help yourself.

27:24.834 --> 27:27.083
Thank you.

27:29.333 --> 27:32.542
Um, I think I'll go get
your salad for you.

27:44.875 --> 27:49.083
- Bree Van De Kamp.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Huber.

27:49.750 --> 27:54.083
We didn't get a chance to talk
at Mary Alice's wake. How are you doing?

27:55.250 --> 27:59.417
<i>Bree longed to share the truth</i>
<i>about her husband's painful betrayal.</i>

27:59.542 --> 28:03.750
<i>But sadly for Bree,</i>
<i>admitting defeat was not an option.</i>

28:03.834 --> 28:07.667
Great. Everything is just great.

28:07.750 --> 28:12.750
I got you the honey mustard dressing.
The ranch looked a little bit suspect.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.583
Are we gonna talk about what I said?

28:24.709 --> 28:27.500
If you think I'll discuss
my marriage in a place

28:27.583 --> 28:31.625
with rest-rooms labeled "Chicks"
and "Dudes", you're out of your mind.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.917
- What's in this?
- What do you mean? It's salad.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.166
- With onions.
- What?

28:41.291 --> 28:44.291
- You put onions in my salad.
- No, I didn't.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.333
Oh, wait.

28:58.750 --> 29:02.875
<i>The sound that awakened my son was</i>
<i>something he'd heard only once before.</i>

29:02.959 --> 29:06.500
<i>Many years ago</i>
<i>when he was quite young.</i>

29:09.041 --> 29:11.333
<i>But he recognized it instantly.</i>

29:18.542 --> 29:21.667
<i>It was the sound of a family secret.</i>

29:41.500 --> 29:45.041
<i>Seven days after my funeral,</i>
<i>life on Wisteria Lane</i>

29:45.125 --> 29:47.166
<i>finally returned to normal.</i>

29:48.333 --> 29:52.709
<i>Which, for some of my friends,</i>
<i>was unfortunate.</i>

29:54.458 --> 29:57.458
- Mommy.
- Now what?

29:57.542 --> 29:59.583
Daddy's home.

30:00.625 --> 30:03.875
Come on. Is anybody home?

30:07.458 --> 30:09.625
I wasn't expecting you for a week.

30:09.709 --> 30:12.166
I have to go back to 'Frisco
in the morning.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.500
I got your call. You sounded frazzled.

30:15.875 --> 30:19.083
- It's been a little rough.
- Hi. Yeah. Peaches.

30:19.166 --> 30:20.959
Did you buy us any presents?

30:21.041 --> 30:23.875
Oh, God, presents.
Wait up. Let me see.

30:30.291 --> 30:34.417
But I'm not giving it to you unless you
promise to go outside right now

30:34.500 --> 30:37.083
and practice throwing for 20 minutes.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.667
- Yeah.
- Punks. Get out.

30:39.750 --> 30:44.667
Who's open? Go out.
Deeper. Touchdown.

30:46.208 --> 30:47.583
Oh, my God.

30:52.083 --> 30:57.458
You got to be kidding. I'm exhausted.
I look terrible. I'm covered in peaches.

30:57.583 --> 31:02.792
- I'm sorry, baby. I got to have you.
- Well, is it OK if I just lie here?

31:02.917 --> 31:05.917
Absolutely.

31:08.166 --> 31:13.250
- I love you.
- I love you more... Oh, baby.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.625
I was having trouble with swelling.

31:15.709 --> 31:18.500
The doctor took me off the pill.
Put on a condom.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.041
- A condom?
- Yeah.

31:20.125 --> 31:22.834
What's the big deal? Let's risk it.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.959
- Let's risk it?
- Yeah.

31:35.125 --> 31:39.375
- I can't believe you tried to kill me.
- Yes, well, I feel badly about that.

31:39.458 --> 31:44.041
Mrs. Huber came over and I got
distracted. It was a mistake.

31:44.125 --> 31:47.125
- Since when do you make mistakes?
- What does that mean?

31:47.208 --> 31:52.417
It means I'm sick of you
being so damn perfect all the time.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.834
I'm sick of the bizarre way
your hair doesn't move.

31:55.917 --> 32:00.000
I'm sick of you making our bed in the
morning before I've used the bathroom.

32:00.083 --> 32:04.417
You're this plastic suburban housewife,
with her pearls and spatula,

32:04.500 --> 32:07.834
who says things like
"We owe the Hendersons a dinner."

32:10.291 --> 32:12.458
Where's the woman I fell in love with,

32:14.083 --> 32:18.834
who used to burn the toast
and drink milk out of the carton?

32:20.959 --> 32:23.000
And laugh.

32:25.208 --> 32:31.458
I need her. Not this cold,
perfect thing you've become.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.000
These need water.

32:53.750 --> 32:57.542
<i>Bree sobbed quietly</i>
<i>in the restroom for five minutes,</i>

32:57.667 --> 32:59.709
<i>but her husband never knew.</i>

33:01.041 --> 33:04.250
<i>Because when Bree finally emerged...</i>

33:07.041 --> 33:09.458
<i>...she was perfect.</i>

33:15.834 --> 33:20.000
- I found my earrings. We can go now.
- Was John here today?

33:20.083 --> 33:21.417
Well, yeah.

33:21.542 --> 33:26.291
The lawn hasn't been mowed. I've
had it. We're getting a real gardener.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.709
- Why?
- Are you deaf?

33:27.792 --> 33:30.458
I just said he's not doing his job.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.333
It's dark. You can't see
the lawn has been mowed.

33:33.417 --> 33:36.500
- It hasn't. Feel this grass.
- I'm not feeling the grass.

33:36.583 --> 33:39.917
Let's just get going.
Come on, we're late.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.041
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

33:53.792 --> 33:58.208
There's Tanaka.
Time for me to go and do my dance.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.458
Good luck, sweetheart.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.000
You see that man just walked away?

34:06.125 --> 34:11.959
Can you make sure he has a drink
in his hand all night long?

34:12.834 --> 34:14.125
Yes, ma'am.

35:49.709 --> 35:53.667
- Susan.
- Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?

35:53.750 --> 35:57.917
Not too well, I'm afraid. I'm trying to
find something to soothe my stomach.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.333
- It's upset?
- Yeah.

36:00.417 --> 36:04.709
I had the worst macaroni and cheese at
the wake. It's been running through me.

36:04.834 --> 36:08.917
And I need to be at my best. Edie
Britt's son is spending the night.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.417
He's spending the night?

36:11.500 --> 36:14.625
Edie is having a gentleman friend
over for dinner,

36:14.750 --> 36:18.000
and I think she plans on
entertaining into the wee hours,

36:18.083 --> 36:20.166
if you know what I mean.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.834
Oh, here's some antacid.
Have you ever tried this?

36:25.792 --> 36:28.750
I can't believe it.
This can't be happening.

36:28.834 --> 36:31.125
Mike can't like Edie
better than me.

36:31.208 --> 36:35.625
You don't know what's going on.
Maybe they're just having dinner.

36:35.750 --> 36:38.333
You're right. They're doing it.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.959
Edie?

37:05.125 --> 37:06.625
Edie?

37:12.166 --> 37:15.750
Hello? Anybody home?

37:18.458 --> 37:20.458
I need to borrow sugar.

37:37.375 --> 37:42.041
Oh, my God.
Oh, yes. Give it to me.

37:42.125 --> 37:46.000
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>the possibility Susan had clung to,</i>

37:46.083 --> 37:51.625
<i>the maybe of Mike Delfino,</i>
<i>was gone forever.</i>

37:53.166 --> 37:55.834
<i>Despite the precariousness</i>
<i>of her situation,</i>

37:55.917 --> 37:58.000
<i>Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.</i>

38:25.625 --> 38:30.208
<i>It didn't take Susan long to realize,</i>
<i>this was just not her night.</i>

38:31.959 --> 38:34.041
Is somebody out there?

38:34.917 --> 38:37.375
Oh, my God. That's smoke.

38:51.917 --> 38:54.250
Oh, my God.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.375
She left candles unattended in the den.

38:57.458 --> 39:00.834
Paramedic said she was lucky.
She could've been killed.

39:00.917 --> 39:03.375
She ran out with nothing on.

39:03.750 --> 39:07.959
- She was having sex with some guy.
- What happened to him?

39:08.083 --> 39:10.750
He got smoke inhalation.
He's at the hospital.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.041
Susan, are you all right?
You look awful.

39:15.125 --> 39:17.375
I'm fine.

39:17.458 --> 39:21.709
I just feel really bad for Edie.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.750
Honey, don't worry about Edie.
She's a strong lady.

39:24.834 --> 39:29.041
Absolutely. She'll get through this.
She'll find a way to survive.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.417
We all do.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.834
Come on.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.375
- What happened?
- Mike.

39:56.458 --> 40:00.834
<i>And suddenly there he was.</i>
<i>Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.</i>

40:00.917 --> 40:05.208
I thought you were...
Where were you?

40:05.291 --> 40:08.834
I just got back from the movies.
Edie had a fire?

40:08.917 --> 40:15.834
Yeah. But she's fine now.
Everything's fine now.

40:15.917 --> 40:18.875
<i>And just like that, Susan was happy.</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:23.667
<i>Life was suddenly full of</i>
<i>possibilities.</i>

40:28.792 --> 40:32.709
<i>Not to mention</i>
<i>a few unexpected surprises.</i>

40:37.542 --> 40:39.083
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.291
<i>- Have anything yet?</i>
- No, nothing yet.

40:41.375 --> 40:45.458
But don't worry.
I'm definitely getting closer.

40:53.709 --> 40:57.625
I brought some champagne.
I thought we should have a toast.

40:57.709 --> 41:01.500
<i>The next day my friends came together</i>
<i>to pack away my clothes,</i>

41:01.583 --> 41:06.125
<i>my personal belongings</i>
<i>and what was left of my life.</i>

41:07.709 --> 41:09.792
All right, ladies, lift 'em up.

41:09.875 --> 41:12.959
To Mary Alice,
a good friend and neighbor.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.583
Wherever you are,
we hope you've found peace.

41:15.667 --> 41:18.250
To Mary Alice.

41:24.959 --> 41:26.875
Let's get this show on the road.

41:26.959 --> 41:29.458
You guys,
check out Mary Alice's clothes.

41:29.542 --> 41:33.417
Size eight? Ha.
She always told me she was a size six.

41:33.542 --> 41:38.041
- We found the skeleton in her closet.
<i>- Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.</i>

41:38.166 --> 41:40.959
- What's that?
- A letter addressed to Mary Alice.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.083
<i>How ironic.</i>

41:43.166 --> 41:47.500
<i>To have something I tried so desperately</i>
<i>to keep secret, treated so casually.</i>

41:47.583 --> 41:51.250
- That's private.
- It's open. What's the big deal?

42:03.375 --> 42:06.500
- What does it mean?
- Don't know. Check out the postmark.

42:06.583 --> 42:09.333
Oh, my God. She got it the day she died.

42:10.917 --> 42:12.625
Do you think this is why she...?

42:13.458 --> 42:18.250
<i>I'm so sorry, girls. I never wanted you</i>
<i>to be burdened with this.</i>

42:20.959 --> 42:23.792
Mary Alice, what did you do?
