<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:44.127 --> 00:46.971
Yeah.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.058
Nancy got me a new DVD:

00:49.049 --> 00:53.054
<i>Reach For Your Life with
Master Stretcher John Brandy.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:56.057
Six weeks, and I'll have
a spine like a Slinky.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.108
Man, I talkin' 'bout...

00:59.268 --> 01:01.612
man, tight on my back, man.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.161
Okay, new alley protocol.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.576
All future stretching
should be done alone

01:12.573 --> 01:14.450
and out of public view.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.132
Good afternoon.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.671
Uh, <i>buenos d√≠as.</i>

01:25.127 --> 01:27.926
I need four to fix up a house.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.724
<i>Cuatro.</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.946
Hey, this
is Mrs. Dwyer's house.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.956
Old Mrs. Dwyer sure did
like concrete amphibians.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.670
It's a shame one
ended up killing her.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.130
You the buyer?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.499
Oh, you speak English.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.126
No, I'm her nephew, Eric,
from Minneapolis.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.298
My condolences.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.137
I lived next door to your aunt.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.722
What a nice lady.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.136
We used to chat about puppies

02:12.132 --> 02:14.100
and serial killers
through the fence.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.139
Wait a... hold...

02:15.135 --> 02:16.682
I thought you were day laborers.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.146
I just need to get the house

02:18.138 --> 02:19.606
on the market
as soon as possible.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.895
You know any day laborers?

02:20.891 --> 02:23.394
Well, I know four day craftsmen,

02:23.393 --> 02:25.236
and they're standing
right in front of you.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.296
Eric...

02:43.288 --> 02:45.131
here's the situation so far.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.467
Given the roof area,
your downspouts

02:47.459 --> 02:49.837
simply don't match your
drainage needs, and I'm...

02:49.836 --> 02:52.385
Look, all I care about
is curb appeal.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.430
I mean, seriously, do people
really look at downspouts?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.898
You had us there for a second,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.437
I tell you what.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.365
Good.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.156
Now, stare at your belly

03:13.151 --> 03:15.074
and pretend it's not a baby,

03:15.070 --> 03:17.118
but something cute like a puppy.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.333
Uncle Hank,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.748
you're being
in my pregnancy photos!

03:22.744 --> 03:23.870
Oh, sorry.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.043
We're getting
Dotty's place fixed up.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.382
It's gonna look pretty good

03:27.374 --> 03:30.344
once we strip away the layer
of old lady.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.093
Leg!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.313
Kahn, that is fresh sod.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.726
You worry about grass,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.101
I worry who move
into this house.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.818
Last thing we need
is more rednecks.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.108
I just hope it's not
another Army guy.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.071
That's kind of my thing.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.153
Yeah, well,
I put up flyer for house

03:52.149 --> 03:53.776
at Nine Rivers Country Club.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.948
Not to make light
of old lady's death,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.868
but one redneck neighbor
down, four to go.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.713
This sweet little house
all spiffed up

04:14.713 --> 04:17.091
reminds me why I love
this neighborhood.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.591
It's the people.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.185
People with a pride of ownership

04:20.177 --> 04:23.681
and a sense of community
and respect for one another.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.021
It's got-dang beautiful,
I tell you what.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.439
So true.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.358
We should do this
to Bill's house

04:30.353 --> 04:31.946
when he dies.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.443
Well, how about that?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.911
Sold in one day.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.746
Lucky, looks like you officially

04:39.738 --> 04:41.991
have the worst house
in the neighborhood.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.163
Well, from an investment
standpoint,

04:44.159 --> 04:46.002
there's no better place to be.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.291
I hope these new neighbors

04:47.287 --> 04:49.540
aren't sourpusses
about loud music.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.758
I just got a new whammy bar.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.763
Well, I imagine any person

04:56.755 --> 04:59.258
who appreciates
fine craftsmanship

04:59.257 --> 05:01.726
will probably be
a fine neighbor, too.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.477
Morning, Baron.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.730
Count... Captain.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.694
Mr. Turtlebee.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.713
Hey, you, shut it down.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.466
I have a work order
to demo the premises.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.711
Oh, don't tell me
I got the wrong address again.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.466
Ted!

05:40.465 --> 05:42.718
Wonderful to see you.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.643
Wait, can it be true?

05:47.639 --> 05:48.982
You bought this house?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.066
Indeed, Kahn.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.731
I did acquire this property.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.023
And today I'm breaking ground

05:53.019 --> 05:56.273
on what some people
refer to as a "dream home."

05:58.400 --> 06:00.368
Proceed.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.737
Incredible!

06:01.736 --> 06:03.409
When I put up flyer
at Nine Rivers,

06:03.405 --> 06:04.748
I thought maybe we'd be lucky

06:04.739 --> 06:08.585
to get somebody's
broke uncle to move here.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.705
Maybe, but I never
dreamed we'd snag

06:10.871 --> 06:13.715
the big kahuna himself,
Ted Wassonasong.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.301
Whoo.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.599
They don't build them
like that anymore.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.756
This is ridiculous.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.976
I think I've actually breathed
cleaner air in Houston.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.140
What's the matter, rednecks?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.729
Progress got you down?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.099
Just think, one day soon,
I will be able

07:12.098 --> 07:15.102
to say two words
I've longed to say to Ted...

07:15.101 --> 07:16.648
"Hey, neighbor."

07:16.811 --> 07:18.654
What is so got-dang great

07:18.813 --> 07:21.612
about living next
to Ted Wassonasong?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.782
Looking at him is like listening
to smooth jazz.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.953
Well, gotta go make
fresh pot of green tea.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.326
Ted's using my bathroom

07:30.325 --> 07:32.043
and Internet
during construction.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.504
It's like a fantasy.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.757
Bobby, look at those guys.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.299
They're not working.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.547
They're littering

07:43.546 --> 07:46.766
and peeing everywhere and...
and scarfing junk food.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.136
Construction is a dream job.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.389
This is why they tell us
to stay in school...

07:52.389 --> 07:55.734
So we don't find out
how great working is.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.446
Man, that dude
had a lot to drink.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.323
This can't be good.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.413
Maybe we should move
down the alley.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.203
Nope, this is our spot,

08:10.198 --> 08:11.825
and we are holding our ground.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.745
Hit it.

08:18.707 --> 08:22.211
It's man's most disgusting act
in reverse.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.553
Stand your ground.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.717
Yeah, but...
Hold!

08:33.722 --> 08:36.726
Look at the size
of that foundation.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.068
I don't think they left room
for a lawn.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.687
No lawn.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.563
How are you holding up, Bill?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.736
Not so good.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.234
The constant loud noises

08:45.233 --> 08:47.702
have made me realize
how much I miss my wife.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.197
Pardon my dust.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.119
Here, I got you all something
I thought you'd like.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.334
Peach chardonnay?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.702
You're welcome.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.873
Care to see
what all the fuss is about?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.082
Oh, my God!

09:01.082 --> 09:02.755
It's a McMansion.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.753
Looks like a bank.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.050
No, a church.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.423
Wait, a casino?

09:07.422 --> 09:09.891
I don't know what the hell
I'm looking at.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.180
This?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.803
This is your dream home?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.475
No, not for me.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.724
I am creating
someone else's dream.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.691
It's what's called
a speculation house.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.029
You didn't think I
was moving here.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.449
Of course, we didn't, Ted.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.741
You're like a movie star,
and we're... we're...

09:29.736 --> 09:32.706
Oh, God, I'm gonna miss us!

09:32.697 --> 09:34.574
Uh... okay.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.952
Can I still use
your facsimile machine?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.626
We can't just sit here

09:43.625 --> 09:45.468
and let this happen
to our neighborhood.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.007
We've got to stop this thing.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.466
I need that chardonnay, please.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.638
And as you can see,

09:56.638 --> 09:59.482
our homes are of modest size.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.318
Nobody has more room
than they need.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.439
Some have less, but they're
better people for it.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.236
And then, there's this.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.906
Five bedrooms,
five and a half baths

10:09.901 --> 10:14.122
in over 4,600 square feet
of obnoxiousness.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.912
Mr. Hill,
are you telling me

10:15.907 --> 10:18.160
there are five bathrooms
in this house?

10:18.159 --> 10:21.083
Yep, as asinine as it sounds.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.706
And are they en suite?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.629
Uh, I don't know
what that means.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.346
Mr. Hill, I play golf twice
a week with Ted Wassonasong.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.307
I am sure he's done
everything by the book.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.766
Affirmative.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.437
Yeah, but there
is one pending matter.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.681
Do you know which agent
has the listing?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.489
We've tried
the gentlemanly route,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.403
now we get tough.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.948
May I please
have the requisite forms

10:51.943 --> 10:53.695
for a legal petition?

10:53.695 --> 10:56.494
I've been here
for, like, forever,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.708
and I've only seen
a petition work once.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.749
And it was for, like, a drinking
fountain or something.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.667
You know who you should talk to

11:03.663 --> 11:05.256
is Edgar Hornsby.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.468
He was the master
at finding legal loopholes.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.711
Now we're talkin'.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.758
Where can I find him?

11:10.753 --> 11:14.303
They say he's been dead
for, like, 11 years.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.720
I heard he's been
dead for 18 years,

11:17.719 --> 11:21.064
but he still got his full
paycheck until last month.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.682
Benefits and everything.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.149
Well, according to this,

11:27.145 --> 11:28.863
he's up on the third floor.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.449
Mr. Hornsby?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.702
Who wants to know?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.420
Well, I'm Hank Hill
and we need your help.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.712
Someone is building
a jackass McMansion

11:47.707 --> 11:49.505
that's gonna destroy
our neighborhood.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.343
Cursed McMansions.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.135
It would be my pleasure
to aid in your fight.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.846
Let's try railroad
right-of-ways.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.689
Any abandoned tracks
on the property?

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
No.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.186
Native Americans lived there?
Visited?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.403
No.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.944
Ah, the Grushaw Act.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.693
Was anyone
violently murdered there?

12:19.614 --> 12:23.585
Okay, have two former presidents
ever shook hands there?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.919
Uh, no.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.461
Gentlemen, you could
spend hours, even days,

12:29.457 --> 12:32.131
watching me scoot around
in my chair

12:32.126 --> 12:33.673
looking for a loophole.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.636
And I might take pleasure
in that, but there's no point.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.100
You're screwed.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.065
Hey, man, how about you let me
take that dang ol',

12:46.057 --> 12:47.809
try that chair, man?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.744
Two breakfast burritos.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.748
Right here, Manny...
And hey,

13:09.747 --> 13:11.249
good coffee today.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.716
Uh-oh, babe alert!

13:15.878 --> 13:17.130
Come and get it!
Lookin' good sugar!

13:17.130 --> 13:18.256
Hey, mama!

13:23.720 --> 13:25.347
Last time I shaved my legs,

13:25.346 --> 13:28.145
this house didn't even have
a second floor.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.734
Still smooth.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.149
Really smooth.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.944
Ted's using cheap
building materials, too.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.658
It's all spackle
and chicken wire.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.199
I don't remember ever
hearing them pound in a nail.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.492
And I practically
live inside that house.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.456
Maybe they hot glued
it together.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.577
I'm not sure how much
more I can take.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.748
I miss the sun.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.746
I'm tired a lot because my body

13:49.746 --> 13:51.089
thinks it's always night.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.923
Well, I like it.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.419
I feel like we fell down a hole
into a fairy tale,

13:56.419 --> 13:59.013
and now we live
next to a beautiful castle.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.893
I can't tell
if the burgers are done,

14:07.889 --> 14:11.564
because there's a got-dang
turret shadow across my grill.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.735
Hey, Luanne.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.736
I've decided

14:21.736 --> 14:24.034
I want the baby's first smell

14:24.030 --> 14:25.748
to be a cinnamon roll.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.163
Oh, that's a great idea.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.046
Egress!

14:44.133 --> 14:46.602
Let go of my house!

14:49.722 --> 14:51.190
Devil house!

14:53.184 --> 14:56.688
First you take my daylight,
now you want my blood?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.739
Everyone step back!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.411
This thing's falling apart!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.205
It's the end of days!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.668
I'm going to get my camera.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.379
This story just might be tragic
enough to be on the news.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.177
My house!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.931
We're gonna die!

15:29.011 --> 15:31.013
Okay, we have no choice.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.686
We've got to take
this house down

15:32.849 --> 15:34.692
before it takes us down.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.734
Heck of a storm last night.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.157
Your homeowner's
should cover it.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.954
It was an act of God,
an angry, vengeful God.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.747
This was no act of God.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.461
Look at those
sledgehammer marks.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.332
It was the act of rednecks
on a drunken rampage.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.218
We don't have anything to hide.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.759
The only one who did something
wrong here was you.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.349
Your shoddy McMansion
was gonna destroy our homes.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.220
We only took it down
in self-defense.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.563
And for the record,
nobody was drunk.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.646
There's a chance

16:54.805 --> 16:57.433
I may not have been
within the legal limits.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.356
I'll see you in court.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.071
Or more likely in the office
of a retired judge,

17:02.063 --> 17:04.361
as these issues
tend to go to arbitration.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.288
This next exhibit, Exhibit 42,

17:11.280 --> 17:13.657
will demonstrate the inferior

17:13.657 --> 17:17.538
tensile strength
of Mr. Wassonasong's fiberboard

17:17.537 --> 17:20.461
to that of construction-grade
plywood.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.335
Here, go ahead and pass
these around.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.641
Now, for those unfamiliar
with tensile strength ratings,

17:30.633 --> 17:33.682
I have put together
a stress versus strain graph.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.681
Mr. Hill, when is this

17:36.681 --> 17:39.025
trip the hardware store
going to end?

17:39.016 --> 17:40.984
Hank is stinking up the place

17:40.977 --> 17:43.400
with all his boring
facts and figures.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.194
People want damning evidence

17:45.189 --> 17:46.736
and courtroom drama.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.736
He needs to throw
a briefcase like Mr. Brady.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.987
Something.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.536
Now is the time the late, great,

17:53.531 --> 17:57.081
gay Perry Mason would
spring a surprise witness.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.714
Yes, a surprise witness.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.382
In my opinion, this
was a justifiable act,

18:06.377 --> 18:09.756
as was set forth in
the 1921 landmark case,

18:09.755 --> 18:12.634
<i>Addison Petroleum
v. McConnaughy.</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:15.557
Whereby homeowners
were allowed to tear down

18:15.553 --> 18:16.975
tilting oil derricks

18:16.971 --> 18:19.690
which posed an immediate threat
to their property.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.404
Your Honor, it's all
right there in the book.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.151
Which I need back
when you're done pawing at it.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.703
I have no bias
toward house size.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.251
I, myself,
have a very big house.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.499
A judge should have
a very big house.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.967
That said,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.758
this court rules in favor
of the defendants,

18:49.754 --> 18:52.507
and does not hold them liable
for any damages.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.600
Court is adjourned.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.686
All right! Way to go!
Yay! We won!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.523
Hey there, Ted.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.199
I hope you're not planning

19:10.191 --> 19:12.660
on going higher
than one-story this time.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.747
Actually, it is not I

19:16.739 --> 19:18.741
who will be
engaging in new construction,

19:18.741 --> 19:20.288
but rather, the city.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.707
Are you aware
of the term "eminent domain"?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.296
Yeah, that's where
the government

19:24.288 --> 19:26.382
buys your property
for public use,

19:26.374 --> 19:28.217
but really they're
doing it for kickbacks

19:28.209 --> 19:31.634
from companies who sign lucrative
development contracts.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.425
Correct.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.422
You see, I found out

19:33.422 --> 19:35.766
two can play
the Edgar Hornsby game.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.226
He dug up an ancient

19:37.218 --> 19:39.220
eminent domain statute
that allowed me

19:39.220 --> 19:41.063
to sell the lot to the city.

19:41.055 --> 19:44.559
Gentlemen, enjoy your
new power substation.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.653
This is terrible!

19:51.649 --> 19:54.619
I thought I was gonna live next
to a powerful man.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.159
Now I just live next to power.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.747
It's not all bad.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.537
At least we'll get
fresh electricity.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.705
I know it's ugly,

20:01.867 --> 20:03.915
but living next door
to a power station

20:03.911 --> 20:05.709
means our baby will probably

20:05.871 --> 20:08.124
grow up to have super powers.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.001
And that will come in handy.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.628
Lucky's always getting
pinned under cars.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.437
Ah, there she is, my substation.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.182
God, I love saying
"my substation."

20:27.435 --> 20:30.655
That thing is
a got-dang eyesore.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.946
I mean, I don't want
Ted's monstrosity back,

20:33.941 --> 20:36.694
but this is a residential
neighborhood, after all.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.741
Well, I do know
of a legal precedent

20:41.741 --> 20:45.666
involving a public utility
and a dairy farm.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.413
I'll tell you on one condition:

20:47.413 --> 20:50.166
nobody messes with my plaque.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.895
I swear, if it wasn't
for the possibility

21:02.887 --> 21:05.185
of being electrocuted,
I'd buy this house.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.728
Well, I'll take a fake house

21:06.724 --> 21:09.227
over a big, ugly one any day.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.480
My head feels funny.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.949
Does it look swollen to you?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.443
Probably just the stress
of this whole ordeal.
