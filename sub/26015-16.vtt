The fact that they even thought
I was gonna trip up on this

08:09.197 --> 08:10.907
really shows they don't really
know strategy.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.575
[cheers and applause]

08:12.658 --> 08:13.576
- Wow. Confident.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.329
- I'm tattooing
with the only real threat

08:16.412 --> 08:17.955
in this competition,
and everybody else--

08:18.039 --> 08:19.498
[overlapping shouting]

08:19.582 --> 08:20.082
Everybody knew this guy
was gonna be

08:20.166 --> 08:21.834
on stage from day one.

08:21.918 --> 08:22.501
He deserves it.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.712
He is versatile. He's solid.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.757
{\an3}He knows exactly what
he's doing, just like me,

08:27.840 --> 08:29.467
and I'll show you
that later, Cleen.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.468
- Whoa.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.010
- It's good to see
that Team Christian's

08:32.094 --> 08:33.304
looking confident.
Oliver.

08:33.386 --> 08:34.054
How's it going with Tony,
buddy?

08:34.138 --> 08:34.889
- Ah, looking good, man.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.432
{\an3}We got some morph action
going on.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.434
Whoo, Team Christian
assigned you

08:39.519 --> 08:40.895
a black-and-gray
realistic woman

08:40.977 --> 08:44.565
and skull morph.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.483
How are you feeling about this?

08:45.566 --> 08:47.860
- Just another Saturday night
for me.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.278
- Yeah!
- Street shop 101.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.196
You take whatever comes
through that door.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.657
I've never backed down
from a tattoo,

08:52.740 --> 08:54.033
and I'm not starting today.

08:54.116 --> 08:54.825
I have strong work ethic
from my dad.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.577
Artistry
from my beautiful mother.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.455
So basically I'm doing
this tattoo for myself,

08:59.538 --> 09:02.458
for my family,
for my heritage, for my team,

09:02.541 --> 09:06.212
and, more importantly,
for Uncle Cleen.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.131
- Uncle Cleen? Tony, I gotta
hear the story on that.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.717
- It's hard to explain,
but he's just your crazy uncle.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.261
He pushes you to be the best,

09:13.344 --> 09:15.179
but he's down to shoot the
[bleep] with you afterwards.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.806
- All right. Does all
of Team Cleen feel that way?

09:16.889 --> 09:19.475
- Oh, absolutely. I mean, Cleen
definitely has your back.

09:19.558 --> 09:23.229
- To me, Team Cleen
is like a family,

09:23.312 --> 09:25.189
{\an8}and we're loyal to each other,
and we never have to stab

09:25.273 --> 09:25.815
{\an8}each other in the back like
Team Christian did with Chris.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.318
- Whoa!

09:29.402 --> 09:32.697
Oh, my God.
- Ooh!

09:32.780 --> 09:33.948
- Chris, you want to comment
on that?

09:34.031 --> 09:34.865
- I chose to be
on Team Christian

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
because, you know,
he spoke on loyalty,

09:36.701 --> 09:41.122
{\an8}and I did get stabbed
in the back, you know.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.833
Look, man, that [bleep]
[bleep] hurts.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.251
It does, you know?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.044
- I'm sorry, buddy.
We hear ya, we hear ya.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.588
What you guys all go through
every season is just

09:49.672 --> 09:51.465
mind-blowing and I give it up
to all you guys

09:51.549 --> 09:53.134
for even showing up
to this thing.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.386
[cheers and applause]

09:55.469 --> 09:57.138
Really.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.015
But let me ask.
TeeJ.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.892
I mean, you pretty much started
this whole alliance thing.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.894
You want to comment on that?
- I always looked at Chris

10:03.978 --> 10:04.937
as a heavy competitor.
- Yeah.

10:05.021 --> 10:05.855
- I mean he's talented
as [bleep].

10:05.938 --> 10:07.982
I'm not gonna take
that away from him.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.275
When Chris showed his cards,

10:09.358 --> 10:11.277
I had no other choice
but to throw mine out,

10:11.360 --> 10:14.071
and it just happened that I was
able to beat him at it.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.615
When it comes down
to this competition

10:15.698 --> 10:16.699
there's only one, so Tiffer
and Tony can go over there

10:16.782 --> 10:20.578
and keep playing
this little game they got,

10:20.661 --> 10:22.997
but we ain't playing that
over here.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.373
- Right.
- [chuckles]

10:24.457 --> 10:25.416
[cheers and applause]

10:25.499 --> 10:28.878
{\an8}- There was no backstabbing.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.755
{\an8}I told Chris to his face
that I didn't trust him.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.799
You made it seem like you
didn't want to be a part

10:33.883 --> 10:36.677
of the team, so, for us,
there was no place for you.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.722
And if you want to hold
a grudge, that's on you.

10:39.805 --> 10:44.685
- Ooh! Whoa!
- You did it playing dirty!

10:44.769 --> 10:47.063
- Every time we had a flash
challenge, I busted my ass

10:47.146 --> 10:49.065
from the time that we start
to the time we stopped--

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
- You complained
the entire time.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.859
- Hold up. Let me talk.

10:51.942 --> 10:52.485
[affirmative shouting]

10:52.568 --> 10:53.527
I voice my opinion,

10:53.611 --> 10:55.071
and you guys shot me
down consistently.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.782
So yeah, I'm not gonna keep on
speaking up and saying [bleep]

10:57.865 --> 11:00.368
if you guys want to tell me
to shut up every time

11:00.451 --> 11:03.704
I open my mouth.
Like, come on.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.331
Who the [bleep] gonna do that?

11:05.414 --> 11:07.583
I [bleep] work just as hard
as everybody else on this team,

11:07.666 --> 11:08.793
and you guys stabbed me
in the back.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.670
- I looked you in the face--
- You made an alliance

11:11.754 --> 11:14.799
against me and told me
to trust you.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.258
All of you guys.
- I looked you in the face

11:16.342 --> 11:17.676
and said I didn't trust you.
- I don't wanna hear

11:17.760 --> 11:19.261
that [bleep].
Don't give me that.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.429
- So you're gonna call me
a liar and say

11:20.513 --> 11:21.180
I didn't look you in the face
- Yeah!

11:21.263 --> 11:22.890
Yeah, I will.
- And tell you

11:22.973 --> 11:24.058
that I didn't trust you.
- Hold up, guys.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.852
Guys, let me cut in here.
Let me cut in here.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.020
Christian.
- Oh, my God.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.315
- Chime in, buddy.
I mean, this is your team.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.233
- All right, man,
you know what, I'm sorry.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.859
I love Chris.
I love everybody here.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.529
And, you know,
the social media team here

11:36.612 --> 11:37.863
can [bleep] chant all day long.
- Oh-ho-ho.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.782
- Social media team?
- And you know what?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.492
I'll say this.
[crowd booing]

11:41.575 --> 11:43.160
Hey, no, that's fine.
Yeah, you know what?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.036
Uh-huh.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.288
I love Chris.
He knows how I feel.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.623
But I'll tell you what.
He's full of [bleep].

11:47.706 --> 11:48.791
What he's saying right
now--dude, the reason

11:48.874 --> 11:50.835
everybody turned their back
was because you sat

11:50.918 --> 11:53.629
and cried like a little baby
and said you weren't gonna do

11:53.712 --> 11:56.132
a tattoo and pouted like
a little--you did,

11:56.215 --> 11:58.050
and everybody saw that too.
- I told you why.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.301
I'd rather play
with integrity.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.511
- All right, guys. Let's--
- I'm not gonna do that!

12:00.594 --> 12:02.721
- Let's temper it down
a little bit.

12:02.805 --> 12:08.477
Clearly, as some grudges end,
others begin.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.520
[laughter]

12:09.603 --> 12:11.814
But holding grudges can be
an issue

12:11.897 --> 12:15.401
because there is something
everyone needs to know.

12:15.484 --> 12:20.865
Finalists, tonight your fate
is also in the hands

12:20.948 --> 12:22.074
of the eliminated artists.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.326
- [groans]

12:24.410 --> 12:25.703
[audience "Ooh"]

12:25.786 --> 12:29.707
- TeeJ made more enemies
than we did.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.793
- Eliminated artists,
you will form a jury of peers

12:32.877 --> 12:35.588
and deliberate to vote
one finalist into the top two

12:35.671 --> 12:39.383
based only
on their tag-team tattoos.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.719
- We can do that.
- Heck yes.

12:41.802 --> 12:42.344
both: Heck yeah.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.640
[cheers and applause]

12:48.267 --> 12:50.769
- Then the judges
will determine

12:50.853 --> 12:53.397
the second finalist to move
into the top two

12:53.481 --> 12:55.483
based on
their tag-team tattoos.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.277
That means the finalist that is

12:58.360 --> 13:00.696
not chosen by jury
or the judges

13:00.779 --> 13:03.199
will be eliminated.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.575
The plot thickens, doesn't it?

13:04.658 --> 13:07.203
- All right.
- Who's it gonna be?

13:07.286 --> 13:09.205
- Finalists and coaches,
you guys have

13:09.288 --> 13:10.873
less than five minutes left.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.375
- We need more time.
- We're out of time, buddy.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.920
This is gonna be a tight race,

13:16.003 --> 13:16.879
but don't place your bets
just yet.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.881
You never know
who's gonna pull ahead,

13:18.964 --> 13:21.467
and with that,
we will be right back.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.220
[cheers and applause]

13:24.303 --> 13:26.972
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:31.894
[cheers and applause]

13:31.977 --> 13:35.105
- Welcome back to
the "Ink Master" season finale,

13:35.189 --> 13:37.233
coming to you from Park Theater
at Park MGM

13:37.316 --> 13:39.401
in Las Vegas!

13:39.485 --> 13:42.780
[cheers and applause]

13:42.863 --> 13:45.574
For the last six hours,
the three finalists

13:45.658 --> 13:47.785
have been tag-team tattooing
with their coaches,

13:47.868 --> 13:51.288
and guess what?
Their time is almost up.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.250
In fact, you wanna
count it down with me?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.211
- Five, four, three,

13:57.294 --> 14:00.381
two, one!

14:00.464 --> 14:02.466
Time is up.
Machines down.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.176
No more ink.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.387
- TeeJ! TeeJ!

14:06.470 --> 14:09.014
- All right, guys.
Clean up those tattoos.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.308
- TeeJ! TeeJ! TeeJ!

14:11.392 --> 14:12.977
- Before they get ready
for the critique,

14:13.060 --> 14:15.229
I gotta know what's going on
with your voice.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.438
- Vegas, baby.
- [laughs]

14:16.522 --> 14:19.441
- Screaming at the crap table
all night last night, man.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.568
My voice is almost gone,

14:20.651 --> 14:22.778
but I got just enough to
make it through the night.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.655
- All right,
we're counting on you.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.323
You guys ready?
- I was born ready.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.159
- All right, Tony

14:29.243 --> 14:30.494
and Cleen, you're first.
Come on up.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.707
[cheers and applause]

14:36.750 --> 14:37.793
- This tattoo is really slick.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.878
I really like the way
that you guys

14:39.962 --> 14:42.631
accent the skull,
the top of the brow

14:42.715 --> 14:43.966
where the actual eye is
on the right side.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.176
<i>It really puts a nice balance</i>
<i>to the tattoo.</i>

14:46.260 --> 14:49.430
<i>The tattoo is</i>
<i>really smoothly executed.</i>

14:49.513 --> 14:52.349
- Not only does this look
like one artist did it,

14:52.433 --> 14:53.225
it's pretty rock solid.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.436
The detail in the eyes
and the lips

14:55.519 --> 14:57.438
give it the beauty of the face.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.815
<i>You also have enough</i>
<i>of the skull in there</i>

14:59.898 --> 15:01.191
<i>to let the toughness</i>
<i>of the skull</i>

15:01.275 --> 15:04.153
<i>show through without ruining</i>
<i>the whole tattoo.</i>

15:04.236 --> 15:08.157
This thing is smooth as ice
everywhere.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.784
[cheers and applause]

15:10.868 --> 15:13.746
- Thank you very much.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.458
- TeeJ and Christian,
come on up.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.628
[cheers and applause]

15:22.588 --> 15:24.465
- We have never seen

15:24.548 --> 15:28.427
a good Japanese dragon done in
this competition until tonight!

15:28.510 --> 15:31.388
- Yes!

15:31.472 --> 15:33.015
[cheers and applause]

15:33.098 --> 15:35.017
<i>- It's not the biggest tattoo</i>
<i>in the room,</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:38.145
<i>but it's got the most amount</i>
<i>of line work,</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:39.855
<i>the most amount of detail,</i>

15:39.938 --> 15:41.815
<i>tiny little things</i>
<i>to accent this thing.</i>

15:41.899 --> 15:43.067
<i>Color is really solid.</i>

15:43.150 --> 15:45.819
- You picked tough colors
to work with.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.154
It's really risky doing
that magenta

15:47.237 --> 15:50.366
against the blue with
the yellow and the whole thing

15:50.449 --> 15:51.533
<i>It's one of those things</i>
<i>you gotta swing</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.577
<i>for the fences,</i>
<i>and you guys did.</i>

15:53.661 --> 15:55.954
- From day one,
it's been about versatility.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.207
"I'm a one-trick pony"
that everybody says.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.958
I don't know how the hell
you see this trick,

16:00.042 --> 16:00.918
you know what I'm saying,
but it's damn good.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.878
- Killer job, guys.
Thank you very much.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.381
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.300
[cheers and applause]

16:09.510 --> 16:12.554
- Finally, Tiffer and Cleen
come on up.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.225
[cheers and applause]

16:16.308 --> 16:18.727
I actually love the photo
that you chose

16:18.811 --> 16:21.855
because the look
in the lion's face

16:21.939 --> 16:23.482
really does translate
really well.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.734
- You played smart
pulling the profile trick.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.819
That's the way to play.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.404
<i>Some of the areas</i>

- That's not photo-realism,

the challenge.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.281
- Chris, what do you think?

34:35.364 --> 34:36.949
- The thing that rings out is

34:37.033 --> 34:38.367
definitely the backwards spine
on the dragon.

34:38.451 --> 34:41.954
The spine's gonna go the
same direction as the scale.

I should have caught it.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.463
- Having a design flaw
on that dragon

34:50.545 --> 34:51.630
definitely knocks it
down a notch,

34:51.714 --> 34:55.426
but it's still, to me,
a really solid, clean tattoo.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.012
The skull morph,
it's not as much line work,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.139

<i>in six hours.</i>

35:00.223 --> 35:01.390

I can peel just as many flaws
out of that thing.
