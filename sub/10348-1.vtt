00:38.710 --> 00:41.890
Good evening. Tonight, the football world
was stunned by the shock news

00:41.910 --> 00:45.380
that after only seven weeks in the job,
Brian clough has been sacked

00:45.510 --> 00:47.070
as manager of Leeds united.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.210
It's been claimed that the footballers

00:49.230 --> 00:51.910
passed a vote of no confidence
in him and certainly today,

00:52.030 --> 00:55.810
the board took the shock decision
that clough must go.

00:55.830 --> 00:58.210
We're talking not only
to Brian clough himself,

00:58.230 --> 01:00.130
but also to the man that he succeeded

01:00.150 --> 01:02.810
as manager of britain's most successful
football team,

01:02.830 --> 01:05.510
to don revie, the england manager,
but Brian clough first of all.

01:05.870 --> 01:08.430
Brian, what's your reaction to being booted
out in this fashion?

01:08.550 --> 01:10.570
Oh, it's a very sad reaction.

01:10.590 --> 01:14.270
Obviously, to be sacked
as you profoundly put it,

01:14.390 --> 01:16.570
and the only way you could put it,
it's a very sad one.

01:16.590 --> 01:18.410
It's a very sad one for me personally,

01:18.430 --> 01:22.330
and I also believe a very sad one
from Leeds football club's angle

01:22.350 --> 01:24.110
and from the Leeds city.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.930
<i>Don revie: You see Brian, when you talk
about coming to take the Leeds job</i>

01:26.950 --> 01:28.410
and you had all these things
and all these worries

01:28.430 --> 01:30.010
about stepping in my shoes
and one thing and another.

01:30.030 --> 01:31.930
- Clough: Which I had.
- Yes, you had.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.770
But why, why did you come
from Brighton to Leeds to take it over

01:34.790 --> 01:37.790
when you'd criticised them so much and
said, "we should be in the second division

01:37.910 --> 01:40.090
"for this and we should do this
and we should do that."

01:40.110 --> 01:41.610
Why did you take the job?

01:41.630 --> 01:44.090
Well, because I thought it was the best
job in the country.

01:44.110 --> 01:45.250
Of course it was the
best job in the country.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.890
I was taking over the league champions.

01:46.910 --> 01:48.110
Yeah, you were taking over
the league champions.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.770
You were taking over the best bunch
of players that you've ever seen...

01:50.790 --> 01:52.570
Well, I didn't know about the players, don.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.690
<i>Revie: You didn't know?</i>

01:53.710 --> 01:55.620
<i>Clough: 'Cause I, I didn't know them
intimate like you do.</i>

01:55.870 --> 02:00.450
But I know you were the league champions
and I was taking over the league champions.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.210
I wanted to have a crack
at the European cup this year.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.790
- Yes.
- I think it was near and dear

02:04.950 --> 02:06.710
- to your heart also.
- Yeah, yes.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.970
Erm... I wanted to win it.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.630
I wanted to do something you hadn't done.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.430
<i>- I believe there's just a fraction, don...
- Revie: Well...</i>

02:14.750 --> 02:17.650
A fraction. I don't know this
'cause I've not spoken to you,

02:17.670 --> 02:21.290
but I believe it's a fraction
whether you took the england job

02:21.310 --> 02:23.810
or had another shot at the European cup.

02:23.830 --> 02:26.210
That is totally true, 'cause I was
so involved with the players

02:26.230 --> 02:27.650
- and everybody at elland road.
- Good lad.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.970
Now I wanted to do that,

02:29.990 --> 02:32.140
and I want to do it better than you.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.500
What's gonna happen now to Brian clough?

02:35.750 --> 02:37.950
Well, a million things are gonna
happen to Brian clough.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.350
Well, aren't you gonna be in a very
difficult situation?

02:40.470 --> 02:43.170
'Cause after the argument with derby,
you left Brighton under a cloud,

02:43.190 --> 02:44.810
and now this with Leeds,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.870
who's gonna touch you with
a barge pole, as it were?

03:05.230 --> 03:08.030
<i>John robertson: We were all wondering
who the next manager was gonna be</i>

03:08.910 --> 03:11.030
and it turned out it was, er, mr clough.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.030
I've known a few days, Trevor.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.690
Er, and it's taken a few days
to sort the problems out

03:15.710 --> 03:18.270
and for me to decide whether I wanted
to come back into football.

03:18.430 --> 03:21.370
We had one thing in common,
of course, we both want success.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.510
The committee wants success and I want
success for Nottingham forest.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.390
<i>Narrator: Let's pause
for a moment and look</i>

03:30.510 --> 03:32.190
<i>at some of Nottingham's early history.</i>

03:35.750 --> 03:37.900
<i>Nottingham's association with Robin hood,</i>

03:38.070 --> 03:40.930
<i>the lace trade,
Nottingham castle, the major oak,</i>

03:40.950 --> 03:43.230
<i>dh Lawrence, Raleigh industries...</i>

03:45.190 --> 03:47.230
<i>Nottingham is, in fact, ideally situated.</i>

03:47.590 --> 03:50.790
<i>The m1 motorway passes
the city directly to the west</i>

03:50.910 --> 03:54.300
<i>and the east Midlands airport is only
15 miles away from the city.</i>

03:54.750 --> 03:58.380
<i>Nottingham is fortunate in having three,
locally based breweries,</i>

03:58.750 --> 04:02.430
<i>carefully selected shops,
water clock and fountains.</i>

04:05.390 --> 04:08.590
<i>Nottingham forest football club,
which plays at the city ground,</i>

04:08.710 --> 04:13.260
<i>was established in 1865 and is
the third oldest football league club.</i>

04:37.510 --> 04:38.990
<i>Radio presenter:
Good morning, it's 7 o'clock.</i>

04:39.110 --> 04:41.630
<i>This is morning report
from BBC radio, Nottingham...</i>

04:43.150 --> 04:46.270
It was a mid-table, second division team.

04:46.630 --> 04:49.670
<i>Tony woodcock: It was my local club.
My parents didn't want me to leave home,</i>

04:49.830 --> 04:53.110
so they wanted me to get hitched up with
a local club and I came down to forest.

04:53.270 --> 04:55.330
It was in turmoil at the
time, I must admit.

04:55.350 --> 04:58.190
<i>We must have had about
three or four managers in that period.</i>

04:58.310 --> 05:01.810
<i>Martin O'Neill: And we were, you know,
languishing in the, what was called</i>

05:01.830 --> 05:04.950
<i>the second division at that time,
championship as it's known now.</i>

05:05.190 --> 05:08.500
And no real sign as if we're
actually going to get back up again.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.130
<i>John mcgovern: Clough was the man.
They'd seen what he'd done</i>

05:11.150 --> 05:13.670
<i>down the road at derby, you know,
performed miracles,</i>

05:13.790 --> 05:17.340
<i>so they were just wondering whether he
could repeat that at Nottingham forest.</i>

05:17.670 --> 05:19.010
I heard all the way in America,

05:19.030 --> 05:22.690
I heard all the way in Indonesia
that this fella talks too much.

05:22.710 --> 05:25.630
They say he's another Muhammad Ali.
There's just one Muhammad Ali.

05:25.830 --> 05:30.070
And I want you to know, whoever you are,
you're not a fighter

05:30.230 --> 05:35.020
and you don't take my job. I'm the talker,
now clough, I've had enough. Stop it.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.370
Presenter: Well are you gonna stop it?

05:37.390 --> 05:39.220
No, I want to fight him.

05:40.230 --> 05:43.830
We would have been in complete awe
of him coming into that dressing room.

05:44.030 --> 05:48.580
I know celebrity status is easily
obtained these days, but he was,

05:48.750 --> 05:53.190
<i>he was a major celebrity. He was on
Parkinson nearly every other week.</i>

05:53.710 --> 05:56.860
To some he's an arrogant loudmouth
who ought to be put in his place.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.750
<i>To other's he someone
who simply speaks his mind</i>

05:59.910 --> 06:02.870
and makes more sense
than the rest of them put together.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.910
But whatever people say about him, no
one's ever yet accused him of being dull.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.220
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian clough.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.740
Interviewer: You took 10,000 fans away
from forest when you took over at derby.

06:15.910 --> 06:17.530
Can you bring them back again to forest?

06:17.550 --> 06:19.540
Well, I would hope to get a few back.

06:20.550 --> 06:25.050
Well, it changed overnight the moment
Brian actually came to the club.

06:25.070 --> 06:26.870
<i>Mcgovern: Obviously,
when clough's got the job</i>

06:27.190 --> 06:30.790
<i>and people look at him and say, "well what
can he do? Who's he gonna bring in?"</i>

06:30.910 --> 06:34.790
<i>But, you know, Ian bowyer,
Tony woodcock, Martin O'Neill,</i>

06:35.070 --> 06:37.050
<i>John robertson, viv Anderson.</i>

06:37.070 --> 06:41.700
<i>Five players there that are gonna go on to
win European cups, that are already there.</i>

06:42.070 --> 06:44.910
<i>Commentator: Fighting to get it back.
Bowyer!</i>

06:45.030 --> 06:47.410
<i>And it's three.
Remarkable goal...</i>

06:47.430 --> 06:49.310
<i>Mcgovern: They've got ability,</i>

06:49.430 --> 06:52.110
<i>but they're not quite sure
how to bring it out in themselves.</i>

06:52.230 --> 06:54.750
<i>Robertson: Oh, I'll never forget
the first time I ever seen him.</i>

06:55.310 --> 06:59.430
It was in the dressing room. It was
a sort of square dressing room with, er,

06:59.550 --> 07:02.110
one door there and one door
further on, on the outside,

07:02.230 --> 07:04.460
and I was sitting facing both doors.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.410
The door burst open, he walked in,
"I'm the new manager of Nottingham forest."

07:08.430 --> 07:10.660
<i>Robertson: It was like
a whirlwind coming in.</i>

07:10.790 --> 07:14.100
And he looked around and just as he was
about to leave, and he said, er,

07:14.230 --> 07:16.750
"I'll be putting a squad up.
Is young O'Neill here?"

07:17.430 --> 07:21.140
And I was, "yeah, I'm here."
He said, er, "you're coming with us, son."

07:21.310 --> 07:24.910
He was just straight with people.
Er, he expected you to be straight back.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.150
I said, "i wanna play centre forward."

07:28.270 --> 07:29.630
He said, "what are you gonna do there?"

07:29.750 --> 07:32.470
I said, "I'm gonna score goals."
He says, "good answer, young man."

07:32.590 --> 07:35.330
Interviewer: Is there any money
available here at forest for new players?

07:35.350 --> 07:39.130
I've not gone into that, er, into that
aspect of the club with the chairman.

07:39.150 --> 07:44.470
I'm certain that, you know,
if I can produce a player

07:44.590 --> 07:47.150
to the committee that they think
will do forest some good,

07:47.270 --> 07:50.370
I'm certain there'll be money available,
but I haven't discussed it with them.

07:50.390 --> 07:53.690
I must admit, we wouldn't have been too
surprised to find that, er,

07:53.710 --> 07:56.310
that John O'Hare and John mcgovern
would be coming.

07:57.150 --> 08:00.150
<i>Mcgovern: I met Brian clough at
the post house at Sandy acre</i>

08:00.310 --> 08:04.150
and the negotiations
over the contract lasted 10 seconds.

08:05.990 --> 08:09.210
<i>O'Hare: When he came in, Nottingham forest,
you know, I'd known him for so long,</i>

08:09.230 --> 08:11.650
he obviously thought
i had something as a player.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.710
<i>So it really didn't take
that much thinking about.</i>

08:13.830 --> 08:17.430
It could have been any club, but I'm
working for the man himself, so,

08:18.390 --> 08:19.530
<i>suited me down to the ground.</i>

08:19.550 --> 08:22.050
<i>Frank Clark: A journalist from the
northeast who was a friend of his</i>

08:22.070 --> 08:24.410
rang him and said, "i hear you're
looking for a left back,

08:24.430 --> 08:25.750
<i>"do you know frank Clark had a free?"</i>

08:25.870 --> 08:27.230
<i>Colin Barrett: "Where are you
playing now?" He said.</i>

08:27.350 --> 08:30.210
"Man city reserves." I said. "Well you'll
be better playing in my first team.

08:30.230 --> 08:33.230
"I'll meet outside a league
town football ground."

08:33.350 --> 08:36.270
So he said, "I'll be there, be
there in an hour." Put the phone down.

08:38.870 --> 08:42.049
<i>Clark: So, I arranged meet him
at a scotch corner hotel.</i>

08:42.070 --> 08:44.450
My car broke down on the way.

08:44.470 --> 08:47.690
So it's probably the only time
i was ever late to meet Brian,

08:47.710 --> 08:50.860
but fortunately he waited,
and we, er, we managed to get it sorted.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.910
He signed me for 29,000,
'cause he wouldn't pay 30.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.750
He said, "you should be paying me."

08:58.710 --> 09:00.070
<i>"To get away from Leeds united."</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:03.210
<i>Interviewer: There has been talk
of Peter Taylor leaving Brighton</i>

09:03.230 --> 09:05.790
and joining you here at forest.
Is this pure speculation?

09:05.910 --> 09:09.110
<i>Mcgovern: When Peter Taylor joined him,
that's when things really took off at forest.</i>

09:09.230 --> 09:11.950
<i>O'Neill: Clough had missed him for about
the 18 months that he'd been there.</i>

09:12.070 --> 09:16.070
He was back. He'd got his spark back. He
was rejuvenated. He was ready to go again.

09:16.230 --> 09:19.940
There was almost like
a renaissance with him.

09:20.070 --> 09:21.790
<i>Mcgovern: He really needed Peter Taylor.</i>

09:21.910 --> 09:25.490
On their own, maybe good
at what they do, but, you know,

09:25.510 --> 09:27.050
<i>unbeatable when they're together.</i>

09:27.070 --> 09:28.730
You know, there was good cop and bad cop.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.820
You never know which one's
gonna be which one.

09:31.670 --> 09:36.750
Peter took me to task really and, er, if it
hadn't been for him I think at that stage,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.330
<i>then I don't know if I'd
ever come through it.</i>

09:39.350 --> 09:44.470
When I first went there, John was
a journeyman midfield player going nowhere.

09:44.990 --> 09:46.670
<i>I thought his attitude was terrible.</i>

09:47.270 --> 09:51.130
I was a bit of a, erm, as Brian clough
would probably call me, "a wastrel".

09:51.150 --> 09:53.290
I don't think I was that bad but...

09:53.310 --> 09:55.410
<i>O'Neill: You know I said I'm a sulker.</i>

09:55.430 --> 09:58.410
<i>But I may well have learned
that from John in the first place.</i>

09:58.430 --> 10:00.710
<i>Well, he was a moaner.
A real moaner.</i>

10:00.830 --> 10:04.790
They really saw in John's attitude,
i think they frightened him really.

10:05.270 --> 10:09.550
I took notice of it. When Pete said
to me, "but we think you can play."

10:10.390 --> 10:14.780
<i>Commentator: Turns... oh, it's great!
And a superb goal! John robertson!</i>

10:16.350 --> 10:18.950
<i>What a fantastic goal by John robertson!</i>

10:20.310 --> 10:24.780
<i>Three-two, Nottingham forest.
Seventeen minutes into the second half.</i>

10:26.670 --> 10:28.820
<i>Oh, you won't see much better than that.</i>

10:31.390 --> 10:32.610
<i>Interviewer: What is it?</i>

10:32.630 --> 10:35.690
<i>Taylor: I believe it's just
the selection and buying of good players</i>

10:35.710 --> 10:39.590
and the ability to manage them and to
put them together etcetera, etcetera.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.050
I think that's what football's
about throughout the world.

10:42.070 --> 10:46.190
It was a building process that only really
took off when Peter Taylor got there,

10:46.310 --> 10:51.180
<i>because he knew exactly who to sign that
would improve the squad we already had.</i>

10:51.390 --> 10:54.330
<i>Lloyd: "You know that, that fella clough at
Nottingham forest,</i>

10:54.350 --> 10:57.030
"he, wants you go up there." I said, "why?

10:58.990 --> 11:00.510
"What division are they in?"

11:00.670 --> 11:02.070
I can remember Larry coming in.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.390
Well, Larry's my mate still,

11:04.510 --> 11:07.230
<i>but he was he, he was
a big time Charlie lad.</i>

11:07.350 --> 11:09.230
<i>O'Neill: He'd been at liverpool,
so he'd been a big player.</i>

11:09.350 --> 11:13.090
Been around the scene
and this was big for us.

11:13.110 --> 11:16.500
<i>Lloyd: When I was signing I was still
hesitant. He said, "wait a minute," he said,</i>

11:16.790 --> 11:18.410
"have you got all your
equipment in your house?

11:18.430 --> 11:21.170
"Have you like washing machines, dryers,
the lot?" I said, "as it happens,

11:21.190 --> 11:22.910
"my wife's washing machine has broken."

11:23.030 --> 11:24.770
"Leave that to me son."

11:24.790 --> 11:28.570
Two blokes turn up in overalls
carrying a washing machine.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.410
I thought, "oh, good on him."

11:30.430 --> 11:33.580
<i>Anyway, the following morning,
i went up to Nottingham training</i>

11:34.230 --> 11:37.230
and these two lovely women,
the laundry women...

11:37.630 --> 11:40.210
"Are you that Larry Lloyd?"
I went "yeah." They said,

11:40.230 --> 11:43.300
"you've nicked our washing machine!"

11:43.550 --> 11:46.850
<i>Bowyer: I remember we played away
at Bolton in the second division</i>

11:46.870 --> 11:48.250
<i>and we were doing okay</i>

11:48.270 --> 11:52.690
and sat round a table with
John robertson, Larry and somebody else...

11:52.710 --> 11:55.830
And I remember saying, "Larry so what
do you think then? What do you think?"

11:56.390 --> 11:58.460
They were hanging on to every word.

11:59.070 --> 12:01.990
And I could remember Larry
drawing on this cigar and saying...

12:03.070 --> 12:05.220
"Not a bad little club
you've got here, boys."

12:05.510 --> 12:08.790
Robertson: So me, Martin and Tony
looked at each other and thought, "mmm...

12:08.910 --> 12:10.950
"Where the hell has he come?"

12:11.110 --> 12:14.110
I'd have to say that Lloyd
was the first major signing

12:14.270 --> 12:17.610
and, erm, and he would
probably agree with that.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.130
Things were starting to change and, er,

12:21.150 --> 12:24.300
<i>there'd been quite a few players
who have left the club now.</i>

12:24.430 --> 12:26.610
<i>And then these great names were coming in</i>

12:26.630 --> 12:28.590
<i>so you obviously wanted to be a part of it.</i>

12:28.950 --> 12:34.810
It did change from being, "not a bad
little club" to being, you know, er,

12:34.830 --> 12:36.030
a good club.

12:50.590 --> 12:52.790
<i>Mcgovern: Right with Roy
and then we got better.</i>

12:53.110 --> 12:55.690
<i>These players are improving as well.
We're getting better.</i>

12:55.710 --> 12:58.940
We signed somebody
else with a bit of quality, we get better.

13:05.430 --> 13:09.060
<i>Bowyer: He used to always have this,
this mantra of three things, you work hard</i>

13:09.830 --> 13:12.750
<i>and if you work hard
you have a chance of playing well.</i>

13:12.870 --> 13:17.190
If you play well then you'll enjoy it.
And that was it.

13:28.630 --> 13:32.070
<i>Woodcock: It was just something
that clicked and moved together and, er,</i>

13:32.710 --> 13:34.890
<i>yeah we must have had some sort of talent</i>

13:34.910 --> 13:38.030
and we must have had some sort of
desire to actually make it to the top.

13:40.230 --> 13:43.590
<i>Presenter: Our last match today brings
together Nottingham forest being taken, well,</i>

13:43.710 --> 13:47.710
forward now, by that well known combination
of Brian clough and Peter Taylor.

13:48.310 --> 13:51.940
<i>Commentator: And it's there!
A fine goal by Chapman.</i>

13:52.190 --> 13:55.820
We've got into a promotion place,
but there's still a game left to play.

13:56.110 --> 13:57.830
We were on the plane to majorca again.

13:58.350 --> 14:01.150
<i>Garry birtles: We were halfway to Spain,
and I'd gone on this trip</i>

14:01.310 --> 14:03.460
because Sammy Chapman didn't like flying.

14:04.990 --> 14:07.650
And I can remember the,
the captain or the pilot saying...

14:07.670 --> 14:10.410
"We've got Nottingham forest in
and hopefully the results are gonna go well

14:10.430 --> 14:12.730
<i>"for them tonight and hopefully
they'll be promoted."</i>

14:12.750 --> 14:15.970
<i>Mcgovern: I think wolves had to go
to Bolton and win the match.</i>

14:15.990 --> 14:17.490
<i>Commentator: It's got hibbett through...</i>

14:17.510 --> 14:20.950
The pilot announced it,
while we were in the air.

14:21.350 --> 14:23.340
And wolves won and we got promoted.

14:23.470 --> 14:26.570
That means all the guys on the plane

14:26.590 --> 14:29.230
they have now been
promoted to, erm, the first division.

14:29.830 --> 14:33.460
<i>Birtles: You can imagine you know,
the euphoria that went on that plane.</i>

14:34.310 --> 14:37.010
<i>I mean, it wasn't turbulence. It was us
jumping around on the plane</i>

14:37.030 --> 14:38.750
<i>I think, you know, celebrating that fact.</i>

14:38.870 --> 14:43.420
It doesn't matter which way you get there.
Get there any way you can.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.030
It was an absolutely fantastic time.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.730
They sneaked in really.

14:59.750 --> 15:03.300
But once that had happened
then we prepared for the first division.

15:03.590 --> 15:06.890
<i>Lloyd: And who did he sign, but probably the
best goalie in the world, Peter shilton,</i>

15:06.910 --> 15:09.470
<i>a hooligan from Birmingham
called Kenny burns</i>

15:09.710 --> 15:13.020
and a little, a little midfield
nasty man called Archie gemmill.

15:13.550 --> 15:17.310
<i>Commentator: Gemmill...
Good play by gemmill. And again!</i>

15:19.110 --> 15:20.340
<i>Three-one!</i>

15:23.030 --> 15:27.660
<i>A brilliant individual goal
by this hard little professional.</i>

15:28.910 --> 15:31.140
<i>The miracle is beginning to happen.</i>

15:31.790 --> 15:35.670
<i>Gemmill: He said, "well, you'll
be winning another title.</i>

15:36.070 --> 15:39.510
"You'll be winning a cup."
Blah, blah, blah.

15:39.750 --> 15:43.060
<i>Mcgovern: You add quality to quality
that's already there, you can't fail.</i>

15:43.630 --> 15:47.230
And you're always welcoming players of
quality into your squad.

15:49.310 --> 15:52.750
He didn't have to sell Nottingham forest,
you know, it was him.

15:55.110 --> 15:57.910
I was on holiday in menorca with, er,

15:59.910 --> 16:00.950
first wife.

16:01.590 --> 16:04.290
<i>He says, "well, give us a call
when you get back in to england."</i>

16:04.310 --> 16:06.170
<i>So, I gave him a call right away,</i>

16:06.190 --> 16:09.410
<i>saying we met up and he signed me, really.</i>

16:09.430 --> 16:11.250
<i>Mcgovern: As he's actually
walked in the dressing room</i>

16:11.270 --> 16:13.010
<i>before he's been introduced to the players.</i>

16:13.030 --> 16:14.940
I think Ian bowyer went,
"don't hit me, Kenny!"

16:16.870 --> 16:22.580
<i>Commentator: Oh, that was a bad one
by burns and the sparks starts to fly.</i>

16:22.870 --> 16:26.830
He wasn't frightened of a player's
reputation. Burnsy came with an iffy rep...

16:26.990 --> 16:30.250
<i>I did. But that didn't worry him.</i>

16:30.270 --> 16:34.470
He knew that he could get us playing
how he wanted us to play.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.610
Having got an opinion from Peter Taylor

16:37.630 --> 16:42.050
<i>that the lad could play football,
then it was up to me to do my job.</i>

16:42.070 --> 16:45.090
<i>Clark: Kenny had played mainly
as a striker in Birmingham</i>

16:45.110 --> 16:46.430
<i>and he had a terrible reputation</i>

16:46.910 --> 16:49.300
as being a bit of a thug
and a difficult player to handle.

16:51.430 --> 16:54.370
<i>How much does he want
to be seen as a respectable guy</i>

16:54.390 --> 16:56.130
in everybody's eyes do you think?

16:56.150 --> 16:57.610
As much as you do, Brian.

16:57.630 --> 17:00.610
<i>Lloyd: You know, when he signed
for forest, I think we were all thinking,</i>

17:00.630 --> 17:03.050
"well who's gonna lose their place
up front?" You know. "Who, who..."

17:03.070 --> 17:05.829
We obviously thought, "we've signed
another striker."

17:07.430 --> 17:11.550
Jimmy Gordon, who's the trainer then,
he said, "right, this lot put the bibs on."

17:11.670 --> 17:17.150
He says, "middleton, Anderson,
Barrett, mcgovern, Lloyd, burns,

17:17.470 --> 17:20.310
"O'Neill, bowyer, withe,
woodcock, robertson."

17:20.550 --> 17:22.940
Points the finger at burnsy. Said, "you,

17:23.109 --> 17:25.190
"you're gonna play
at the back next to the big head."

17:25.990 --> 17:27.060
Said, "wow."

17:27.630 --> 17:29.490
I thought by big head he meant me.

17:29.510 --> 17:33.550
Turned out that then I believe, I know
it's blowing our own trumpet here,

17:33.670 --> 17:36.630
<i>but I believe Kenny burns
and myself were as effective as</i>

17:36.830 --> 17:41.540
<i>any central defensive partnership
in the land and better than most.</i>

17:42.910 --> 17:46.110
Shilts was the best goalkeeper
i ever played with

17:46.230 --> 17:49.050
<i>and I think at the time he was probably
the best goalkeeper in the world.</i>

17:49.070 --> 17:52.460
<i>Shilton: Went down to city ground
at Nottingham to discuss terms.</i>

17:52.870 --> 17:56.950
<i>I had a couple of, what I call financial
advisors, agents they are these days.</i>

17:57.230 --> 18:00.910
<i>And as they opened the door, went to
walk in with their briefcases etcetera,</i>

18:01.430 --> 18:04.930
they went sprawling across the room.
Papers flying everywhere

18:04.950 --> 18:07.130
<i>and I looked down and clough
is sat on the floor</i>

18:07.150 --> 18:09.460
tripping them up with his squash racket.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.610
<i>I thought, "these negotiations aren't
gonna go very well."</i>

18:12.630 --> 18:15.940
<i>Clark: Him and Peter were always,
always thinking and plotting,</i>

18:16.070 --> 18:19.770
"how can we gain an edge somewhere?
How can we get a bit more from him.

18:19.790 --> 18:20.910
<i>"How can we do this?"</i>

18:21.070 --> 18:24.300
He was fantastic at man management.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.630
<i>Lloyd: He knew that I craved praise.</i>

18:27.950 --> 18:31.010
So he knew that I would strive
and I would play better, obviously,

18:31.030 --> 18:32.940
to get that pat on the back.

18:33.230 --> 18:36.010
One of cloughy's favourites,
when you're doing particularly well,

18:36.030 --> 18:39.100
it was like that sign.
You know, he used to go.

18:39.550 --> 18:43.750
Well, it all started about the third to
fourth game in pre-season training.

18:44.510 --> 18:48.900
<i>Tackles started flying in.
And the other lad going down the touchline</i>

18:49.350 --> 18:52.980
and I went over and I've hit him.
Right through the fence he went.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.430
Brian clough shouted, "Kenneth!"

18:56.950 --> 18:59.150
It was only him and my mum
that used to call me Kenneth.

18:59.310 --> 19:02.700
And he just turned round, and I thought,
"oh, no," and he went...

19:04.190 --> 19:06.850
<i>And that's, that's annoyed
big Larry to this day.</i>

19:06.870 --> 19:11.340
<i>Never ever got one of those
and it really says, "you're his favourite."</i>

19:11.950 --> 19:14.490
Can anyone love burnsy? But there you go.

19:14.510 --> 19:16.550
You know cloughy loved him. "Kenneth."

19:16.710 --> 19:18.780
Kenneth is no different from anybody else.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.150
"Kenneth!"

19:21.910 --> 19:24.470
"Give me that sign, will you?"
But he never did.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.390
<i>Commentator:
And a shot here from Lloyd!</i>

19:28.510 --> 19:32.670
<i>Gemmill: Players thrived
at what he was doing,</i>

19:32.790 --> 19:36.550
<i>because it was always
that competitive edge.</i>

19:36.670 --> 19:38.710
<i>It was never mundane.</i>

19:39.350 --> 19:41.810
<i>Interviewer: How would you describe
the gift that you have got</i>

19:41.830 --> 19:44.980
<i>of getting players
to perform above themselves?</i>

19:45.350 --> 19:51.090
Erm, gift's a very, very strong word
and I don't think that I get them

19:51.110 --> 19:54.740
to perform above themselves.
I think we have 15 talented players.

19:54.910 --> 19:57.510
He was the most charismatic man
I've ever met in my life.

19:58.190 --> 20:02.410
<i>You knew if he walked in a room, you knew
he was there, even if you didn't see him,</i>

20:02.430 --> 20:04.630
<i>you knew somebody special
had walked in there.</i>

20:04.790 --> 20:07.940
You know how many letters
I've had in four days from mp's? Six.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.390
You know what they want?

20:10.590 --> 20:12.450
They want something.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.990
They don't wanna give anything,
they just want something.

20:15.670 --> 20:19.990
<i>O'Neill: You talk about managers being
years ahead of their time.</i>

20:20.350 --> 20:21.970
<i>There's no question that he was.</i>

20:21.990 --> 20:26.830
If you ask any player who's the
best manager? There's only one.

20:27.390 --> 20:30.290
He's got a charisma and a magic
that nobody else in the game

20:30.310 --> 20:31.670
<i>seems to have at the moment.</i>

20:32.070 --> 20:33.870
<i>Birtles: He trusted you on the pitch.</i>

20:34.150 --> 20:36.870
<i>He picked the best 11,
once you've crossed that white line,</i>

20:37.030 --> 20:41.150
it was always one of his sayings, "you're
fit and it's down to you. I trust you."

20:41.990 --> 20:47.390
We're all together when we go
over that white line. Totally united.

20:48.110 --> 20:51.530
<i>Bowyer: You were only ever under
one pressure when Brian was the manager.</i>

20:51.550 --> 20:53.350
<i>If you gave your lot then that was it.</i>

20:53.670 --> 20:56.450
He could live with people
mis-controlling the ball.

20:56.470 --> 20:59.970
<i>He could live with people
shooting at goal and missing the target.</i>

20:59.990 --> 21:01.410
<i>He could handle all that.</i>

21:01.430 --> 21:04.310
<i>He couldn't live with you
not giving your lot.</i>

21:04.630 --> 21:09.690
You would actually die for your teammate

21:09.710 --> 21:14.970
in that 90 minutes and that's what
winning teams are all about.

21:14.990 --> 21:19.310
<i>Mcgovern: If there isn't the commitment, no
amount of ability will guarantee the result.</i>

21:20.190 --> 21:22.230
But we had both in abundance.

21:28.150 --> 21:31.030
<i>Commentator: So, for Nottingham forest,
it's back to the main task</i>

21:31.150 --> 21:32.730
<i>of winning the first
division championship...</i>

21:32.750 --> 21:37.070
<i>Woodcock: I can remember running out
and it being so loud with forest supporters</i>

21:37.230 --> 21:40.860
<i>and I kept thinking,
"wow! This, we've hit the big time here."</i>

21:41.310 --> 21:43.990
And then a couple of minutes later,
Everton came out

21:44.430 --> 21:46.340
<i>and it was really such an impact</i>

21:46.470 --> 21:49.390
<i>that you felt you had to sort of duck down,
you know, with the noise.</i>

21:49.670 --> 21:52.310
<i>Robertson: We got out and played
and the first 20 minutes,</i>

21:52.430 --> 21:53.910
I was breathing through my...

21:55.710 --> 21:58.150
You know, we're just up there
and everybody thinks

21:58.310 --> 22:00.990
<i>'cause you've just came up
you're gonna get turned over.</i>

22:02.310 --> 22:06.860
The pace was ferocious. I honestly
thought this is really too much.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.380
<i>Robinson: But then we scored,
Peter withe got a goal.</i>

22:09.510 --> 22:11.130
<i>O'Neill: The game changed completely.</i>

22:11.150 --> 22:14.410
<i>Robertson: And it just seemed, everything
seemed to calm down and we just took over</i>

22:14.430 --> 22:18.870
and we played unbelievably well.
Won the game three-one.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.450
<i>O'Neill: And what a feeling that was,
so we're off and running</i>

22:21.470 --> 22:23.670
away from home. We've won up at Everton.

22:24.150 --> 22:27.190
<i>Mcgovern: And somebody's
knocking on the dressing room door.</i>

22:27.990 --> 22:30.190
<i>"Come in. Delighted to see you."</i>

22:30.510 --> 22:34.110
<i>So, I was thinking, "who's this?"
And it was bill shankly.</i>

22:34.910 --> 22:37.270
The former liverpool manager.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.770
<i>And he said, "bill, I'm just giving
them a rollocking,</i>

22:39.790 --> 22:43.730
<i>"telling them how poor they were,
but I think you should do it."</i>

22:43.750 --> 22:49.110
"You've won your first game, but the first
division's a marathon, not a sprint."

23:07.710 --> 23:11.010
Yeah, we talk about cloughy
and cloughy's era, there was no plan.

23:11.030 --> 23:13.090
There's never been a plan, you know?

23:13.110 --> 23:16.950
He'd come in before the game and say, "this
is the ball, you pass it to a teammate."

23:17.630 --> 23:21.410
"You, you head the ball, you kick the
ball, and if you have time with the ball

23:21.430 --> 23:23.580
"at your feet give it to someone
who can play."

23:24.470 --> 23:28.940
"You get the football, and you give it
that little fat bastard on the wing."

23:29.350 --> 23:30.930
"Give it to John robertson."

23:30.950 --> 23:32.470
"He can play."

23:32.710 --> 23:34.700
"You can't, so you give it him."

23:35.070 --> 23:37.810
We reduce things perhaps
to a little bit of simplicity

23:37.830 --> 23:41.610
where other managers might,
you know, find them complex.

23:41.630 --> 23:45.390
I don't know whether it's a gift
or if I have a gift or anything.

23:45.510 --> 23:47.110
It's very straightforward to me.

23:48.110 --> 23:51.340
<i>Robertson: He was a genius
as far as simplicity was concerned.</i>

23:52.110 --> 23:56.190
<i>In the fact that he communicated
what he wanted brilliantly.</i>

23:56.710 --> 24:00.550
And he spoke about the game
being simple. Simplicity.

24:00.670 --> 24:03.050
You can't play well unless
you have the foot... you know,

24:03.070 --> 24:04.870
that little football that we play with.

24:04.990 --> 24:07.990
They had it more than we did
and on our pitch that's sacrilege.

24:08.430 --> 24:13.250
"If they are going to run
the show on my pitch," he said,

24:13.270 --> 24:16.310
"I'm going to fall out
with you and you and you."

24:16.590 --> 24:19.110
<i>Burns: I says, "boss, what are we
going to do about free kicks?"</i>

24:19.990 --> 24:22.370
He says, "shoot".

24:22.390 --> 24:25.350
<i>"Ah, right. What about
indirect free kicks?"</i>

24:25.790 --> 24:29.750
He says, "fucking put the ball to the side
and shoot." And that was it.

24:33.950 --> 24:38.790
We had to get changed at the city
ground and then jog down the Trent

24:39.030 --> 24:41.590
<i>to a little bit of waste
ground down by boots.</i>

24:54.310 --> 24:56.690
Nowadays I don't think you could
actually call it training,

24:56.710 --> 25:00.180
<i>playing five-a-side's or playing
mount through the legs.</i>

25:00.670 --> 25:03.390
<i>You name it, very, very basic stuff.</i>

25:03.710 --> 25:08.630
You'd have a player on your back,
piggy back and run through the nettles

25:08.750 --> 25:11.510
by the side of the Trent,
you know, the stinging nettles.

25:11.630 --> 25:15.630
"I want a straight path round that tree
and back. No cutting corners.

25:15.990 --> 25:17.810
<i>"Get through the nettles and come back.</i>

25:17.830 --> 25:20.850
<i>"Get over that wall, out of sight,
i don't wanna see you."</i>

25:20.870 --> 25:24.770
Grown men scrambling up into
the directors box and hiding.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.930
And hiding behind somewhere
so you couldn't see them

25:26.950 --> 25:30.100
and they're looking at each other and
thinking, "what are we doing here? Yeah?"

25:30.230 --> 25:32.690
<i>O'Hare: You know, some days
we'd come in like you wouldn't even train.</i>

25:32.710 --> 25:36.150
We'd just go for a walk along the river
or, see it was they just didn't know.

25:36.550 --> 25:38.850
<i>Barrett: The modern day footballer
don't know what it's like.</i>

25:38.870 --> 25:41.810
<i>Shilton: Garry birtles used to say,
"I'm not training today, lads,</i>

25:41.830 --> 25:43.170
<i>"I'm playing squash with the gaffer, "</i>

25:43.190 --> 25:44.530
and it was nearly every day.

25:44.550 --> 25:47.050
What are you laughing at?

25:47.070 --> 25:48.810
- That's true, he was my squash partner.
- Yeah? Yeah?

25:48.830 --> 25:50.090
Yeah.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.870
<i>He finished at 12 o'clock,
we were in the wine bar at 12 o'clock,</i>

25:52.990 --> 25:54.750
he said, "col, do you want a drink?"

25:55.390 --> 25:58.290
I said, "well I'm hopefully
playing this afternoon, boss."

25:58.310 --> 26:01.590
"Yeah you are playing, but if it makes you
play better, have a drink."

26:01.990 --> 26:05.620
<i>Burns: We all went round to the cafÃ©.
"Can we have 14 chip cobs."</i>

26:06.390 --> 26:09.620
<i>Barrett: Diets? God's truth.
Our diet would have been shot dead.</i>

26:09.950 --> 26:10.990
We didn't over train.

26:12.350 --> 26:15.950
He gave us as much days off as,
as we did training.

26:16.110 --> 26:17.750
And he was right. He believed in rest.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.750
"I don't wanna see anybody
in here till Thursday."

26:21.270 --> 26:24.970
Frank's getting on, he's about I don't know
48 or something at the time.

26:24.990 --> 26:28.950
And you know he just got out, put his
tracksuit bottoms, his trainers on

26:29.270 --> 26:31.610
<i>and he just goes
for a little jog, just to loosen up.</i>

26:31.630 --> 26:35.630
<i>Clark: Nothing strenuous or not too far, but
something just to keep myself ticking on.</i>

26:36.110 --> 26:37.830
And cloughy found out about it.

26:38.150 --> 26:42.670
I've gone into the ground one day and he got
hold of me and he went absolutely berserk.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.270
<i>He said, "when I say
you have a rest, you have a rest.</i>

26:45.430 --> 26:49.030
"If I find out you've been training on your
day off again," he said, "I'll fine you."

26:49.790 --> 26:53.420
And I tried to argue with him,
but lost the argument, obviously.

26:53.590 --> 26:56.150
<i>But you look at Brian clough and his
methods there it's,</i>

26:56.750 --> 26:59.140
if you have a couple of
days off work, legit.

26:59.470 --> 27:02.310
You know, you come into work
and you've got a bounce in your step.

27:02.550 --> 27:06.430
<i>Over the next two seasons, my
first two seasons here, and I played 108</i>

27:06.710 --> 27:10.340
consecutive games.
Never missed a game for two seasons.

27:10.550 --> 27:13.700
And at the end of the second season
he called me in to see him,

27:14.230 --> 27:16.290
and he said, "well, who
was right now, then?"

27:16.310 --> 27:18.930
And I looked at him and I thought,
"what's he talking about here, like?"

27:18.950 --> 27:22.130
And that's what he was talking about from
two years ago. He'd never forgotten it.

27:22.150 --> 27:25.030
<i>O'Neill: I have to say, generally speaking,
the results were so good,</i>

27:25.150 --> 27:28.780
whatever he was trying, whatever he was
doing was very successful.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.690
Presenter: Now, Brian clough said
in midweek that every side

27:31.710 --> 27:34.050
had to be built from defence
and a lot of your stuff

27:34.070 --> 27:35.730
had been built at the back four
and the goalkeeper.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.330
Do you subscribe to that entirely, do you?

27:37.350 --> 27:40.970
Oh, definitely. You know, the back four
you know, from shilts through Kenny burns,

27:40.990 --> 27:43.140
<i>viv Anderson, Colin Barrett, Dave needham.</i>

27:44.350 --> 27:47.530
<i>No, they're absolutely fantastic and even
with the successful days at derby,</i>

27:47.550 --> 27:51.340
it was built on a back four, a good back
four, that's not gonna give away goals.

27:51.550 --> 27:54.450
<i>Needham: I was at home with the wife
and she who's making a Christmas cake</i>

27:54.470 --> 27:57.310
<i>and the phone rang
and she answered the phone,</i>

27:57.510 --> 28:00.430
and, erm, "it's Brian clough."

28:00.990 --> 28:05.380
<i>"Dave, could you come over and meet me
at the Italian restaurant on Trent bridge?"</i>

28:06.550 --> 28:09.690
"Yes, sir, yeah course I can."
Yeah, so off I went

28:09.710 --> 28:13.070
and signed for him there and then.
It was, I just couldn't believe it.

28:13.310 --> 28:16.910
I think the first half of that season
was some of the best football,

28:17.030 --> 28:18.630
<i>well, certainly, I've ever played in.</i>

28:18.830 --> 28:22.670
Well, whether we really, really believed
we could win the league at that stage,

28:23.070 --> 28:24.140
I very much doubt it.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.430
<i>Needham: My first game was
Manchester united away at old trafford.</i>

28:28.270 --> 28:30.340
Coming in, first game panicking like hell.

28:30.550 --> 28:34.430
<i>We knew that we were playing well, but this
was gonna be a major test at old trafford.</i>

28:34.870 --> 28:38.330
And everybody thought that this would be
our comeuppance like,

28:38.350 --> 28:40.090
because we were the upstarts.

28:40.110 --> 28:43.110
I can remember Ian bowyer actually,
"if you wanna do it anywhere,

28:43.430 --> 28:44.990
<i>"this is the place to do it."</i>

28:45.230 --> 28:47.830
It just happened, we were a good side.

28:49.150 --> 28:53.940
<i>Commentator: Woodcock chasing... looking
so... oh, it's so lucky and unlucky!</i>

28:55.390 --> 28:57.430
<i>Came off the unlucky Brian greenhoff.</i>

28:57.790 --> 29:00.750
<i>Robertson. Well, that could be awkward,</i>

29:01.270 --> 29:03.470
<i>and it's well thumped in by woodcock.</i>

29:09.030 --> 29:12.210
<i>If you'd have tried to pick the man of
the match out of the Nottingham forest team</i>

29:12.230 --> 29:14.540
you'd have struggled that day,
because we were flying.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.830
<i>We absolutely dominated them,</i>

29:17.270 --> 29:20.150
and I thought, "oh, Christ, what have i
come to here? This is fantastic."

29:20.350 --> 29:23.790
<i>Commentator: Comes to meet him
and it's going to be three, and it is.</i>

29:27.190 --> 29:30.050
<i>Here's gemmill...</i>

29:30.070 --> 29:33.690
<i>Look at that, gemmill forward,
Clarke again a run in on the keeper</i>

29:33.710 --> 29:35.150
<i>and this time number four.</i>

29:37.190 --> 29:40.820
<i>Manchester united buried
in their own back yard,</i>

29:41.510 --> 29:45.670
<i>by a team that has the hallmark
of its creator, Brian clough.</i>

29:45.950 --> 29:49.090
To go there and beat them four-nil on
their own patch and could have been eight.

29:49.110 --> 29:50.870
Hold on here, we could be onto something.

29:51.070 --> 29:53.410
<i>Commentator: Nottingham forest
have given the best display</i>

29:53.430 --> 29:55.470
<i>by a team that I've had
the privilege of seeing this season.</i>

29:55.670 --> 29:58.820
<i>O'Hare: You know, they're not just winning,
they're hammering teams, you know?</i>

29:59.230 --> 30:01.770
And playing great football.
And I said, "you'll win the league.

30:01.790 --> 30:03.870
<i>"I'll tell you ways of playing
and destroying teams."</i>

30:04.230 --> 30:06.250
<i>Mcgovern: I think the way
we've played this season, as I said,</i>

30:06.270 --> 30:09.850
you know, football's a game of habits.
If we keep on doing the right things

30:09.870 --> 30:12.990
then there is no way that we won't
win something this season.

30:13.230 --> 30:15.350
<i>Commentator: Ah, that's gemmill,
he really stole that.</i>

30:16.190 --> 30:18.410
<i>O'Hare...</i>

30:18.430 --> 30:19.970
<i>Clark: Momentum, that's the word,
you know?</i>

30:19.990 --> 30:21.650
<i>The team just gained its momentum.</i>

30:21.670 --> 30:25.030
Kept on winning. The critics kept
on saying, "it can't last.

30:25.230 --> 30:27.270
<i>"It won't last, they'll fall away."</i>

30:33.270 --> 30:37.270
Interviewer: Is there a feeling that even
yet the season could blow up in your faces?

30:37.470 --> 30:42.340
<i>Bowyer: Media guys, journalists,
were always talking about the forest bubble</i>

30:42.750 --> 30:46.140
<i>and he used to remind us of it, you know?
He used to say,</i>

30:46.390 --> 30:48.170
<i>"is the bubble gonna burst this week?"</i>

30:48.190 --> 30:50.990
<i>And it was, it was
all that he needed to say, really.</i>

30:51.150 --> 30:54.250
<i>There was an element
of us against the media,</i>

30:54.270 --> 30:57.450
because we thought
we were a little provincial club.

30:57.470 --> 31:02.090
We didn't quite get the rewards
or the credit that, er,

31:02.110 --> 31:07.710
possibly our style of football
and our results deserved, so, yeah.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.970
<i>Taylor: Yeah, people always
said that about us, you know?</i>

31:09.990 --> 31:11.250
<i>That the bubble's gonna burst.</i>

31:11.270 --> 31:13.050
<i>We've had that thrown at us right
through our career.</i>

31:13.070 --> 31:14.790
<i>You know, we've been together now 12 years.</i>

31:15.030 --> 31:17.530
I think that in itself is an incentive
for us to do well.

31:17.550 --> 31:22.230
<i>Clough: We just go out to win a match
and we do it to the best of our ability.</i>

31:22.390 --> 31:26.890
<i>We go out to entertain the public.
We go out to pack football grounds.</i>

31:26.910 --> 31:31.890
<i>We go out to make you and I want
to come to football matches.</i>

31:31.910 --> 31:35.330
We try to entertain and
you never know, John,

31:35.350 --> 31:41.530
you and your profession just might
recognise that we are a good side.

31:42.990 --> 31:45.650
Well, let's have our last action now
and we catch up with

31:45.670 --> 31:47.430
the first division leaders
Nottingham forest.

31:47.550 --> 31:49.170
Interviewer: What's the attitude
in the dressing room

31:49.190 --> 31:52.170
towards the sort of press you're getting?
Do you, do you think you're now being

31:52.190 --> 31:54.250
<i>genuinely recognised
as the sort of quality side you are?</i>

31:54.270 --> 31:56.950
<i>Well, I don't think so, I don't think
britain realises how good we are.</i>

31:57.070 --> 32:00.460
<i>But I'm sure come the end
of the season when we win it,</i>

32:00.950 --> 32:03.550
I think people will have,
people have to give us recognition then.

32:04.030 --> 32:08.190
The team was playing so well that we
actually got to the league cup final

32:08.310 --> 32:10.780
<i>and I was cup tied and Chris woods
played in it.</i>

32:10.910 --> 32:13.990
<i>Mcgovern: I don't think it's ever an
advantage to be playing liverpool at all,</i>

32:14.230 --> 32:17.700
'cause I think they are the most
difficult side to play in a cup final.

32:20.510 --> 32:23.210
<i>Commentator: Brian clough has held
everybody up. That's...</i>

32:23.230 --> 32:24.630
<i>Now what's that all about?</i>

32:24.910 --> 32:28.540
<i>He's getting the forest players to wave to the
forest crowd. That's never happened before</i>

32:28.910 --> 32:32.540
<i>where the manager has held up
the walking on ceremony.</i>

32:33.430 --> 32:35.500
<i>But that, after all, is Brian clough.</i>

32:35.790 --> 32:39.230
The team that we had to beat was liverpool.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.620
And everybody loved liverpool. You know.

32:41.750 --> 32:44.110
<i>They were the kind of yard
stick that you went by.</i>

32:44.470 --> 32:46.670
They were the team
that you wanted to emulate.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.850
Chris woods played in goal

32:51.870 --> 32:54.350
and if it hadn't been for him,
we'd have been beaten seven-nil.

32:56.270 --> 32:59.470
With all the other players around me it
was you know a really tremendous feeling.

32:59.670 --> 33:02.490
<i>Liverpool had a few chances
and missed and scuffed them</i>

33:02.510 --> 33:06.730
and we didn't really have an awful lot
as an attacking force that afternoon.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.110
<i>Man: Maybe because we were
underdogs to start with</i>

33:09.270 --> 33:11.580
<i>it helped us get a result
or two against them.</i>

33:12.030 --> 33:14.430
<i>Lloyd: Then of course we went
to old trafford for the replay.</i>

33:16.990 --> 33:20.990
We were defending a corner and I was
actually on the edge of our box.

33:21.270 --> 33:23.950
<i>The ball got knocked out
to Tony woodcock on the left</i>

33:24.230 --> 33:27.130
<i>and I started on my run
from the edge of our box.</i>

33:27.150 --> 33:29.710
People say, "i must have
gotten a taxi to get there."

33:30.150 --> 33:31.410
But I got there.

33:31.430 --> 33:34.770
<i>Lloyd: John O'Hare went hurtling through the
middle, about two yards outside the box.</i>

33:34.790 --> 33:36.010
<i>Thompson trips him.</i>

33:36.030 --> 33:37.390
It was my only chance to get him.

33:37.790 --> 33:40.250
It a foul, but I mean, people said,
"oh, he dived, dived."

33:40.270 --> 33:41.970
But I never, never dived.

33:41.990 --> 33:46.110
Great dive into the box. Penalty. And robbo
of course, as he did just stuck it away.

33:46.310 --> 33:48.910
<i>Thompson: I had to kick him outside
the box. I know it sounds bad,</i>

33:49.230 --> 33:51.730
<i>but any professional'd do it.
I brought him down outside the box.</i>

33:51.750 --> 33:54.210
Obvious penalty.
I think John would have stuck it in.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.810
No, no one's doubting it, surely?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.450
Interviewer: What was
John O'Hare's feeling about it?

33:57.470 --> 33:59.300
Well, he said, "certainly
inside, certainly."

33:59.470 --> 34:00.870
Well, your cameras will catch it, surely?

34:01.030 --> 34:04.490
Interviewer: Yeah, and I think they show
it outside. That's how it goes, eh?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.820
It also shows we've got the cup.
That's the main thing.

34:07.630 --> 34:11.210
<i>Commentator:
And Kenny burns takes the trophy</i>

34:11.230 --> 34:16.409
<i>and who better to lift it to the forest
fans on this night?</i>

34:16.429 --> 34:23.670
<i>Burns and clough a partnership
that may yet have a long way in football.</i>

34:23.790 --> 34:28.489
<i>And may not have seen
by any means, the last of the silverware.</i>

34:28.510 --> 34:30.330
<i>O'Hare: Probably about 20, 22 years later,</i>

34:30.350 --> 34:33.110
<i>I was working for
Martin O'Neill at Leicester city.</i>

34:33.230 --> 34:36.830
I go up to anfield to watch a game.
Do a match report,

34:37.110 --> 34:40.310
<i>and I pull up at the big car park
at Stanley park.</i>

34:40.510 --> 34:45.060
So, I put my window down and says,
"excuse me, John O'Hare, Leicester city."

34:45.310 --> 34:49.570
His exact words were,
"fuck off, we don't like you here."

34:52.949 --> 34:54.489
Interviewer: But where were you
when he tripped you?

34:54.510 --> 34:58.630
Ah, you know, I mean to me I thought it
was just, maybe just in the box you know.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.060
Interviewer: What about
that one remaining point?

35:02.270 --> 35:03.370
What's that, Brian?

35:03.390 --> 35:06.070
Well, the one remaining point that
you need to win the championship.

35:06.430 --> 35:08.810
That I hope we'll get tomorrow.

35:08.830 --> 35:11.570
<i>It's been a hell of a long season.
It's been a hell of a good one,</i>

35:11.590 --> 35:14.570
<i>but we still want that point.
And we hope to get it tomorrow.</i>

35:14.590 --> 35:18.220
And we feel that football
hopes we'll get it tomorrow.

35:24.630 --> 35:28.070
We've got another two or three games
to go I think, but we needed a point.

35:30.990 --> 35:33.970
<i>Clark: When we played coventry,
the game when they actually won the title,</i>

35:33.990 --> 35:35.530
<i>shilton was magnificent.</i>

35:35.550 --> 35:39.020
You could have maybe had a thousand
shots at him, you wouldn't beat him.

35:40.910 --> 35:44.540
<i>Taylor: I said before we kicked a ball, i
thought we'd qualify for Europe, no more.</i>

35:44.670 --> 35:47.870
<i>And that would have been an achievement,
but having signed shilton, I said then</i>

35:47.990 --> 35:49.510
<i>that anything is possible.</i>

35:50.150 --> 35:52.990
<i>Mcgovern: I turned to the manager and said,
"well done, boss, we've won it."</i>

35:53.150 --> 35:55.890
<i>Shook his hand and he kind of went,
"oh, yeah."</i>

35:55.910 --> 36:00.690
<i>You know, almost nonchalantly as if, "well,
yeah, okay we've won it, but you know,</i>

36:00.710 --> 36:02.410
<i>"there's nothing to really celebrate."</i>

36:02.430 --> 36:05.820
<i>When, you know, the supporters
are going absolutely berserk</i>

36:05.950 --> 36:09.490
on the terraces at coventry, you know,
'cause we've won the league championship.

36:09.510 --> 36:14.250
To win that over that length of time
was fantastic and also the way we did it.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.740
<i>O'Neill: It got to a stage,
if we didn't win at coventry,</i>

36:16.870 --> 36:18.050
<i>we would have probably
won it the next week,</i>

36:18.070 --> 36:19.730
<i>and if we didn't win it the next week,</i>

36:19.750 --> 36:21.770
we were gonna win it the week after.
We just needed the point.

36:21.790 --> 36:23.010
<i>Interviewer: There's only one manager</i>

36:23.030 --> 36:25.530
<i>who's won a championship
with two different clubs.</i>

36:25.550 --> 36:28.050
You are on the verge of doing that now.

36:28.070 --> 36:32.540
Erm, is there much left for you to do
once you've done it do you think?

36:32.790 --> 36:35.790
We played some, you know, fantastic stuff.

36:35.910 --> 36:40.910
People say football's changed a lot. Yes,
it has. But the football that we played

36:41.030 --> 36:44.690
and the speed it was played at,
were, were brilliant.

36:44.710 --> 36:49.730
If we win the championship
this year, we would like to go on and do

36:49.750 --> 36:53.690
<i>you know, English football proud in the
European competition next year.</i>

36:53.710 --> 36:57.530
In this day and age it's like that.
Whoever got, who gets promoted now

36:57.550 --> 37:00.940
go and winning it, it's, it'll never
be done. It will never be done again,

37:01.070 --> 37:05.070
<i>so it was quite unique and it was a quite
unique set of players we had at the time.</i>

37:07.150 --> 37:10.220
<i>Burns: I've always said I'm, you know,
that's my position in the back four.</i>

37:10.470 --> 37:12.410
<i>You know, just that
nobody else has believed me.</i>

37:12.430 --> 37:14.090
<i>You know and the boss says, "believe me."</i>

37:14.110 --> 37:16.450
Interviewer: I think plenty of people
believe you now, Kenny burns.

37:16.470 --> 37:19.090
<i>Mcgovern: We've won the league cup,
we've won the league championship.</i>

37:19.110 --> 37:22.770
Erm, it's a unique double for the club.
I'm highly delighted

37:22.790 --> 37:25.260
for every single person
concerned with the club.

37:26.030 --> 37:30.170
We've done it how I would assume
everybody likes to do their job.

37:30.190 --> 37:32.470
Nicely, honourably and well.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.970
Plenty of positive things for the crowd
to cheer at Nottingham forest yesterday,

37:35.990 --> 37:39.140
as Brian clough and Peter Taylor
walked out to receive

37:39.270 --> 37:42.690
the first division championship trophy
before yesterday's game

37:42.710 --> 37:45.090
against Birmingham city.
As Hugh Johns reports.

37:45.110 --> 37:48.150
<i>Johns: The football league championship
comes to Nottingham forest.</i>

37:48.270 --> 37:53.950
<i>A championship side put together by those
two men, Brian clough and Peter Taylor.</i>

37:55.550 --> 37:59.940
<i>A side that they both agree
has played with style.</i>

38:00.790 --> 38:03.450
<i>There it is, that's what it's all about.</i>

38:03.470 --> 38:08.150
<i>John mcgovern, skipper.</i>

38:08.790 --> 38:10.170
<i>Interviewer: A lot of people think that</i>

38:10.190 --> 38:12.660
<i>one of the main reasons
for Nottingham forest's success,</i>

38:12.790 --> 38:16.170
is the success that you've shown
on the field, John robertson.

38:16.190 --> 38:19.490
Again, a player that seems to have been
brought on by Brian clough

38:19.510 --> 38:21.630
and Peter Taylor's influence. Yes or no?

38:22.670 --> 38:27.370
<i>Commentator: Well played, straight to, er,
John robertson by the Ipswich defence...</i>

38:27.390 --> 38:28.910
<i>And a goal!</i>

38:32.230 --> 38:36.700
<i>Well, it's a beautiful
shot by John robertson.</i>

38:38.510 --> 38:42.590
John robertson was like Ryan giggs
but with two good feet.

38:44.070 --> 38:47.210
<i>O'Neill: The most influential player
in Europe for about,</i>

38:47.230 --> 38:50.050
I would say maybe
three and a half years, four years.

38:50.070 --> 38:52.830
<i>Woodcock: John robertson,
playing on the left for real Madrid.</i>

38:52.950 --> 38:57.390
He will go down as one of the world's
greatest left-sided players. Without a doubt.

38:57.510 --> 39:01.190
I think, you know, I think Robert
could have been clough's secret son.

39:01.350 --> 39:05.010
We've got a little fat guy
that will turn him inside out.

39:05.030 --> 39:06.390
- Interviewer: John robertson?
- Yeah.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.870
Very talented, highly skilled,
unbelievable outside left.

39:11.230 --> 39:14.460
He'll turn him inside out.

39:16.750 --> 39:22.110
I know he liked me, but I loved him. I thank
the day he walked into the football club,

39:22.630 --> 39:24.530
<i>'cause I'd have never have
a career without him.</i>

39:24.550 --> 39:28.260
The biggest thing is they gave me
confidence of what, what I could do well

39:28.710 --> 39:32.870
and didn't really bother so much as to about
what I couldn't do so well, you know?

39:34.230 --> 39:37.570
<i>Clark: They converted him
into a wide left player,</i>

39:37.590 --> 39:40.060
and encouraged him to do
what he was good at.

39:41.070 --> 39:42.750
<i>Commentator: Robertson... yes!</i>

39:42.910 --> 39:45.450
Robbo didn't believe how good he was,
I'll be honest with you.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.890
<i>He used to panic like hell. He used
to look at the team sheet every week.</i>

39:48.910 --> 39:50.130
<i>We knew he was in.</i>

39:50.150 --> 39:52.620
<i>Lloyd: You know,
we'd come in at half time</i>

39:52.910 --> 39:55.770
and very often you know,
cloughy had to tweak it a little bit.

39:55.790 --> 39:58.730
Things weren't going as we expected.
And then someone said,

39:58.750 --> 40:03.510
"well wait a minute, rob... robbo's in there."
So you look... in the bathroom, in the toilet.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.950
<i>So you look in there
and you see a plume of smoke.</i>

40:07.070 --> 40:10.830
Cloughy, "ah leave him. He'll pick it up when
he gets on the pitch. He'll know what to do."

40:11.110 --> 40:13.910
And then he used to
sit there having a cigarette.

40:14.470 --> 40:17.130
Over 20 yards, John wouldn't
have beaten anybody, you know?

40:17.150 --> 40:18.300
He wouldn't have beaten my father.

40:18.430 --> 40:23.790
No pace whatsoever.
Couldn't tackle a good fish supper.

40:24.270 --> 40:25.590
Couldn't tackle my granny.

40:25.710 --> 40:28.770
But, left foot,

40:28.790 --> 40:32.310
right foot. Genius.

40:33.270 --> 40:35.290
He could always beat people
without touching the ball.

40:35.310 --> 40:39.310
<i>Gemmill: When you see him, he just
goes past people that are, are quick.</i>

40:40.310 --> 40:42.530
And he'd just leave them dead.

40:42.550 --> 40:43.950
He was that good.

40:44.310 --> 40:48.100
<i>O'Neill: The fulcrum of the team, you'd think
normally would be maybe centre midfield,</i>

40:48.230 --> 40:52.150
<i>maybe centre back or whatever the case
may be, or centre forward.</i>

40:52.350 --> 40:56.140
The fulcrum of our side was outside left.
It went there.

41:05.190 --> 41:08.710
<i>Bowyer: It was, it was a terrific time,
just, you know, exciting times.</i>

41:08.830 --> 41:11.810
The people of Nottingham,
I'm sure they were better at their jobs.

41:11.830 --> 41:15.650
<i>Players who were the biggest
employer of people at that time,</i>

41:15.670 --> 41:20.290
I'm sure they, you know, Monday mornings
at players were a lot happier

41:20.310 --> 41:26.150
<i>than they were five or six years previously,
so it affected everybody. Touched everybody.</i>

41:30.510 --> 41:34.410
<i>Barrett: One of the lads when I went back to
man city said, "oh, what a town that is, "</i>

41:34.430 --> 41:36.550
<i>said, "five girls to every guy."</i>

41:36.670 --> 41:40.210
Yeah, Nottingham was buzzing.
You know, I love the city.

41:40.230 --> 41:44.510
<i>Shilton: You know, we had a team... in those
days that were, that were characters.</i>

41:44.670 --> 41:47.930
<i>You know, and they'll, the lads didn't
mind going out for a drink.</i>

41:47.950 --> 41:50.550
<i>Birtles: We were sort of the only
team who got fined if we didn't go out</i>

41:50.710 --> 41:53.370
<i>on a Friday night for a drink.
It was one of those sort of situations.</i>

41:53.390 --> 41:56.330
<i>O'Neill: It was a great spirit
and camaraderie about the players.</i>

41:56.350 --> 41:59.330
I know that that's always talked about.
Everywhere you go, people who,

41:59.350 --> 42:02.740
they win a game or two,
people say there's a great spirit.

42:02.870 --> 42:03.930
There was a great spirit.

42:03.950 --> 42:07.450
We weren't just winning a game or two,
we were winning loads of games.

42:07.470 --> 42:10.850
<i>And we were winning big
trophies and we were beating everybody.</i>

42:10.870 --> 42:14.910
<i>Barrett: The beauty about this
football team was that these boys,</i>

42:15.030 --> 42:17.890
<i>we were a close-knit family in as much as,</i>

42:17.910 --> 42:21.540
<i>if somebody who is out on a birthday,
we all went out on the birthday.</i>

42:22.150 --> 42:25.540
If somebody was wetting the baby's head,
we all went out wetting the baby's head.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.270
<i>Mcgovern: It certainly wasn't work.
I don't think any footballer</i>

42:28.390 --> 42:31.970
should ever say he's got to go to work,
because, you know, he needs educating.

42:31.990 --> 42:33.390
Tell him to come and see me.

42:33.550 --> 42:36.110
<i>Birtles: We just had the time of our life,
it was absolutely brilliant.</i>

42:36.230 --> 42:38.380
We were getting paid for it as well.
How good is that?

42:56.790 --> 42:59.610
Well, it's been a grey
and misty morning in London.

42:59.630 --> 43:02.650
Even so a crowd of 50,000
were at white hart Lane,

43:02.670 --> 43:05.740
awaiting the arrival of the football
league champions.

43:07.190 --> 43:10.630
<i>Commentator: And here they come,
Nottingham forest, champions of england.</i>

43:10.790 --> 43:15.970
<i>Unbeaten in their last 37 games.
Unbeaten in their last 39 league games</i>

43:15.990 --> 43:19.430
<i>and with just one defeat
in their last 59 games.</i>

43:19.630 --> 43:23.790
<i>These men have really created records
that take your breath away.</i>

43:26.270 --> 43:28.690
<i>And you don't need me to tell you
who's behind it all.</i>

43:28.710 --> 43:32.500
<i>Here he is, Brian clough, of course.
Manager extraordinary.</i>

43:32.630 --> 43:35.970
<i>And he'd be the first to tell you that the
man just going out of the picture there,</i>

43:35.990 --> 43:39.450
<i>Peter Taylor, his right hand man,
has had just as much to do</i>

43:39.470 --> 43:41.300
<i>with this phenomenal success as he has.</i>

43:42.150 --> 43:45.970
<i>Brian clough getting a great
reception from this Tottenham crowd.</i>

43:45.990 --> 43:49.850
<i>That's good to see
and you have to admit that he deserves it.</i>

43:49.870 --> 43:53.850
The previous year, it was
the second division that we had eventually,

43:53.870 --> 43:56.510
whatever you say about,
almost scrambled up.

43:56.670 --> 43:58.010
<i>Now we'd won the league</i>

43:58.030 --> 44:01.330
<i>and I think we'd kind of proved
ourselves in that sense.</i>

44:01.350 --> 44:03.730
<i>You know, there was there,
there was something there.</i>

44:03.750 --> 44:08.890
There was more there for the manager
to at least mull over.

44:08.910 --> 44:11.530
Interviewer: Lastly, I'm gonna get you
to have a feel of this, Brian,

44:11.550 --> 44:13.650
and tell me what it feels like,
the European cup.

44:13.670 --> 44:17.030
Well at first, obviously, the first
thing is it feels very, very heavy.

44:17.190 --> 44:20.730
But you know, if we can get it
at the end of this coming season,

44:20.750 --> 44:23.090
it'll feel like a feather.

44:23.110 --> 44:25.530
And I would like the,
i would like our name on it.

44:25.550 --> 44:27.090
Interviewer: Keep holding it, it suits you.

44:27.110 --> 44:30.050
We were all looking forward
to, er, to playing in Europe.

44:30.070 --> 44:34.930
We had ideas of going to Rome
and Madrid and Paris and Milan and...

44:34.950 --> 44:36.050
Who do we get?

44:36.070 --> 44:37.170
- Bang!
- Liverpool.

44:37.190 --> 44:38.230
Liverpool.

44:38.350 --> 44:41.900
<i>Bowyer: Not just an anti-climax because
you've been to liverpool a million times,</i>

44:42.030 --> 44:46.710
<i>but you've also drawn probably
the toughest team in the competition</i>

44:46.870 --> 44:48.860
and the reigning European champions.

44:52.390 --> 44:53.930
Interviewer: Brian,
coming back to where we started,

44:53.950 --> 44:55.570
because this is the big question
for you this weekend.

44:55.590 --> 44:57.610
How really are you gonna cope
with liverpool next weekend?

44:57.630 --> 44:59.370
Because they have got
the European experience.

44:59.390 --> 45:01.310
<i>They've got the experience
of the two leg system.</i>

45:01.710 --> 45:04.370
Yes, they've got 14 years start on us,

45:04.390 --> 45:09.310
because I think they've been in Europe 14... 14
years on the trot and this is our first year.

45:09.710 --> 45:12.430
<i>Er, we're gonna cope with them
as we coped with them last year.</i>

45:12.550 --> 45:17.290
<i>To, you know, do our best.
We can't worry too much about liverpool.</i>

45:17.310 --> 45:21.070
If we're worried about liverpool,
they drive us... they'll drive us crackers.

45:22.150 --> 45:23.790
It was quite deflating.

45:23.950 --> 45:25.670
We were all disappointed.

45:25.910 --> 45:31.250
The place was, er, was in a sombre mood.
No getting away from it.

45:31.270 --> 45:34.110
<i>Robertson: They were
the measure of what you had to achieve.</i>

45:34.230 --> 45:37.450
To draw them in the first round,
the holders as well.

45:37.470 --> 45:42.330
Well, I was a bit sick to be honest with
you. If I'm probably telling the truth,

45:42.350 --> 45:45.350
I thought, "maybe we ain't gonna do this."

45:50.110 --> 45:53.580
The whole world, well the whole of Europe
thought that liverpool would beat us.

45:53.750 --> 45:56.450
<i>O'Neill: Pundits,
journalists alike thought,</i>

45:56.470 --> 46:01.010
<i>"well, okay, Nottingham forest have won the
league, but now they get their comeuppance."</i>

46:01.030 --> 46:04.500
<i>Clark: Can't possibly beat liverpool
over two legs. You know, this mob.</i>

46:04.630 --> 46:09.260
Erm, but Brian and, and Peter as usual were,
were very confident and bullish about it.

46:09.630 --> 46:12.290
So we'll concentrate
on our game, putting it together.

46:12.310 --> 46:15.650
We'll concentrate on trying
to get a goal at our place, obviously.

46:15.670 --> 46:17.650
We'll concentrate on keeping a clean sheet.

46:17.670 --> 46:20.770
The normal things and we'll concentrate
on providing good football.

46:20.790 --> 46:22.510
What are you gonna achieve
finally in this season, Brian?

46:22.630 --> 46:24.990
You stunned us last season.
You haven't had the best of starts, but...

46:25.150 --> 46:26.970
And it's a good word
as well, 'cause we did stun you.

46:26.990 --> 46:28.130
Yeah you did.

46:28.150 --> 46:30.990
And everybody, and the trophies
are there to prove it.

46:31.150 --> 46:34.220
Within two or three days,

46:35.150 --> 46:40.470
<i>we've all cleared our heads. We've been told
that we're equally as good, if not better.</i>

46:40.630 --> 46:43.510
<i>Mcgovern: Clough, when he called us
together, he said, "listen."</i>

46:44.310 --> 46:48.750
<i>He said, "you know what they'll be saying
in their dressing room? 'Not them again.'"</i>

46:49.030 --> 46:51.020
<i>Lloyd: He said,
"if we're gonna win it,</i>

46:51.150 --> 46:54.030
"you'll have to meet liverpool at some
stage, so beat them in the first round.

46:54.150 --> 46:55.210
"Get them out of the way."

46:55.230 --> 46:59.070
Fortunately for us,
the game came and we were awesome.

47:02.350 --> 47:04.550
<i>Commentator: Anderson to burns again.</i>

47:06.270 --> 47:09.070
<i>Really right on top of his game tonight.</i>

47:09.670 --> 47:11.580
<i>Bowyer... a little flick on!</i>

47:12.430 --> 47:15.500
<i>Woodcock... and birt... birtles has got it!</i>

47:15.910 --> 47:21.110
<i>His first ever goal for Nottingham forest
and it had to be the European cup.</i>

47:21.510 --> 47:22.550
<i>One-nothing.</i>

47:26.030 --> 47:29.170
<i>Well, what a night for garry birtles.</i>

47:29.190 --> 47:32.090
Garry was Roy of the rovers
when he joined us.

47:32.110 --> 47:37.190
<i>He'd gone from obscurity to
headline fame literally overnight.</i>

47:37.390 --> 47:41.070
Everybody likes to score against liverpool
and, er, tremendous feeling.

47:41.190 --> 47:44.870
From that moment on,
he was brilliant.

47:48.390 --> 47:50.210
We never believed that
we couldn't beat them.

47:50.230 --> 47:52.270
Even though they were
the great liverpool team.

47:55.270 --> 47:57.790
<i>It was just a case of
holding out, we'll keep it out</i>

47:57.950 --> 48:00.290
one-nil, one-nil, we'll
grind it out one-nil.

48:00.310 --> 48:02.380
It was forest and they couldn't believe
what was happening.

48:02.550 --> 48:03.780
<i>O'Neill: The time was running out.</i>

48:03.910 --> 48:05.270
And they tried to get a goal.

48:05.390 --> 48:08.130
They'd get a corner.
We cleared it off the touchline.

48:08.150 --> 48:11.410
<i>Phil Neal tries to pass it
up the line, Colin blocks it.</i>

48:11.430 --> 48:12.470
I think he won it twice.

48:12.590 --> 48:14.110
<i>Barrett: And it's gone out to birtles.</i>

48:15.630 --> 48:17.780
For some reason I've
gone galloping forward.

48:19.590 --> 48:22.230
The two of them, almost in unison jump up.

48:22.430 --> 48:23.570
"Where's he going?"

48:23.590 --> 48:26.290
"What is that lunatic doing?
Where's he going?"

48:26.310 --> 48:29.460
Phil Thompson came sort of sliding in
but didn't quite get it.

48:29.590 --> 48:33.220
He's crossed it and Tony's just
cushioned the ball for Colin Barrett.

48:36.590 --> 48:38.230
And I just hit it sweet.

48:41.110 --> 48:42.630
"What's he doing! Great goal."

48:42.950 --> 48:44.570
"Oh, what a goal!"

48:44.590 --> 48:46.790
<i>O'Neill: And I remember
Peter Taylor afterwards saying,</i>

48:46.910 --> 48:50.300
"we were encouraging them to go forward
in the last couple of minutes in the game."

48:50.430 --> 48:52.580
What Colin's doing up there, I don't know.

48:52.750 --> 48:53.950
"Colin scored that?"

48:54.110 --> 48:57.500
And I can still remember
Tony woodcock grabbing hold of me

48:57.630 --> 49:01.470
<i>and I told him to f-off, 'cause I was
on my way. I was running round the ground.</i>

49:02.270 --> 49:04.770
If you ever scored a goal against
liverpool in a game like that,

49:04.790 --> 49:06.670
you realised how fast you can run.

49:06.790 --> 49:10.170
Out of all the liverpool games
we've played over the years,

49:10.190 --> 49:11.990
I always remember Colin Barrett's goal.

49:12.310 --> 49:15.780
I actually think that the
goal that Colin scored

49:16.190 --> 49:21.790
made that second leg at anfield
not easy, but easier.

49:22.150 --> 49:25.570
<i>Mcgovern: I know the manager won't like it
if we get too excited you know what I mean,</i>

49:25.590 --> 49:27.810
<i>but you're in the dressing room
for five minutes,</i>

49:27.830 --> 49:31.870
the only talking point is,
"col, what were you doing up there?"

49:37.030 --> 49:39.670
I never saw that goal again
for about another 10 years.

49:39.830 --> 49:42.790
It was about the time when Jr got shot,
Jr ewing got shot.

49:43.150 --> 49:45.990
This is the wife. So she put it on tape

49:46.310 --> 49:49.150
and my goal was on tape.

49:49.510 --> 49:52.490
<i>Commentator: Some confidence to do it.
Not a bad looking cross... woodcock!</i>

49:55.950 --> 49:57.710
<i>Woman: It was you, Kristen.</i>

49:58.670 --> 50:00.710
True story. Wives, eh?

50:05.510 --> 50:08.510
The Saturday previous to the return leg,

50:08.630 --> 50:12.020
liverpool beat Tottenham
seven-nil at anfield.

50:12.150 --> 50:16.700
<i>Commentator: But it's gone to dalglish and
he turns and... dalglish at the far post.</i>

50:17.590 --> 50:20.870
<i>In it goes, and this is becoming a riot.</i>

50:22.030 --> 50:24.420
Interviewer: So that performance
against spurs doesn't frighten you?

50:24.550 --> 50:26.530
- Nothing, not that much.
- Right.

50:26.550 --> 50:29.550
We should have scored seven past
spurs on the first match of the season.

50:29.670 --> 50:30.990
What are their weaknesses?

50:31.230 --> 50:34.540
Well, the weakness is that they couldn't
score a goal against us last season.

50:34.910 --> 50:36.230
That's not a bad one for a start,

50:36.350 --> 50:39.660
so don't ram seven goals down
my throat or anybody else's.

50:40.190 --> 50:44.270
<i>Clark: Colin got injured in
ensuing games before the second leg.</i>

50:44.390 --> 50:49.750
So I, I played in the second leg up there
and it was a bit like the alamo at times.

51:00.550 --> 51:03.210
<i>Birtles: Anfield was
the hardest place ever to go to.</i>

51:03.230 --> 51:05.930
<i>Shilton: It was incredible.
It was so electric,</i>

51:05.950 --> 51:10.070
and in those days obviously the kop it
was, it was standing. They were swaying.

51:10.310 --> 51:13.290
Brian always told us,
"right, get out on the pitch before."

51:13.310 --> 51:16.150
So we all went down the kop and of
course all the booing and everything,

51:16.270 --> 51:18.100
<i>throwing oranges and everything at us.</i>

51:18.270 --> 51:20.410
I used to love the liverpool nights.

51:20.430 --> 51:25.140
A tennis ball came on the pitch
and John robertson flicked it up,

51:25.550 --> 51:27.750
volleyed it straight
in the top corner of the net.

51:27.950 --> 51:30.430
All of a sudden the mood changed
and they all started cheering.

51:31.430 --> 51:33.790
<i>How to take the pressure off
in one easy lesson.</i>

51:37.070 --> 51:41.130
<i>Shilton: As a team we defended really well
and that starts from the front players,</i>

51:41.150 --> 51:44.300
<i>midfield players and of course,
the back four were brilliant.</i>

51:44.470 --> 51:46.940
<i>Lloyd: Obviously, they had a little bit
more on, on our goal.</i>

51:47.070 --> 51:49.770
<i>They had more attacks, more shots.
But shilts was in good form,</i>

51:49.790 --> 51:53.290
<i>burnsy and I were in good form,
the full backs were in good form.</i>

51:53.310 --> 51:55.780
<i>Bowyer: We just knew that if
the other team got the ball,</i>

51:55.910 --> 51:58.450
<i>then I should be marking him,
he should be doing this.</i>

51:58.470 --> 52:03.100
And, and it, and it just, it was just us,
it just fell into shape if you like.

52:06.310 --> 52:07.790
<i>Commentator: Good tackle by bowyer.</i>

52:07.950 --> 52:10.630
<i>They do show you how to win the ball,
these forest midfield players.</i>

52:10.830 --> 52:13.510
We were compact,
as soon as people come in our half,

52:13.630 --> 52:16.190
<i>that's when we started to close them down.</i>

52:16.470 --> 52:18.460
And we became really expert at it.

52:18.630 --> 52:20.460
<i>Gemmill: You rolled your sleeves up.</i>

52:20.630 --> 52:25.340
You're digging in and you know how good
they are, but you've just gotta keep going.

52:27.670 --> 52:28.870
<i>Commentator: We're in time added on now</i>

52:28.990 --> 52:33.380
<i>by the French referee for stoppages and there
won't be too much. There'll hardly be any!</i>

52:33.510 --> 52:37.690
<i>That whistle signals the end of
liverpool's hold on the European cup.</i>

52:37.710 --> 52:44.850
<i>Nottingham forest's organisation and flair
and style over the two matches was too good,</i>

52:44.870 --> 52:48.910
<i>even for the European champions.
It's the end of an era.</i>

52:49.030 --> 52:51.670
<i>Shilton: That was great credit to us,
because liverpool were, you know,</i>

52:51.830 --> 52:57.370
a great team, had some great players,
but we had that little bit more.

52:57.390 --> 53:01.570
<i>Commentator: The kop is silent.
Silent in tribute to forest</i>

53:01.590 --> 53:05.910
<i>who won a tie, which at the start of it, many
people didn't think they had much chance of.</i>

53:06.030 --> 53:09.870
Robertson: When we beat liverpool,
i remember Bob Paisley saying afterwards,

53:09.990 --> 53:11.850
<i>he thought we could go on and win it.</i>

53:11.870 --> 53:16.070
And you realise, "mmm, I think we must have
a bit of respect in this in this world."

53:16.190 --> 53:18.410
Getting into the European cup
was the hardest thing,

53:18.430 --> 53:20.010
'cause you had to win the league,

53:20.030 --> 53:23.850
but once we got past liverpool,
i think we thought, "you never know."

53:23.870 --> 53:27.390
If this is the best Europe's got, you
know, maybe we have got a chance.

53:27.550 --> 53:30.550
<i>Interviewer: How far do you think your
own side can go in the European cup?</i>

53:30.670 --> 53:33.730
I think we'll go reasonably well, John.
We don't know, you see.

53:33.750 --> 53:36.550
We're babes in the wood
regarding European football.

53:36.670 --> 53:38.900
Um, what we do know
is we've beaten liverpool.

53:39.030 --> 53:43.770
That's all we can do. We've knocked them
out. We don't know who we're going to draw.

53:43.790 --> 53:46.890
We don't like talking,
you know, hypothetically.

53:46.910 --> 53:50.910
I, personally, don't talk about things
that, you know, are not there yet.

53:51.070 --> 53:53.750
We're not going to anticipate.
We're going home tonight.

53:53.870 --> 53:57.950
We're gonna go to bed, have a couple
of beers, perhaps on the coach,

53:58.310 --> 54:00.750
and we're gonna get ready
for Aston villa on Saturday.

54:00.870 --> 54:03.790
And I'm not kidding,
that's as far as it goes.

54:03.910 --> 54:07.790
After that almost domestic confrontation
with liverpool, Nottingham forest's

54:07.910 --> 54:12.620
first true venture into the unknown
areas of the European cup begins here,

54:12.750 --> 54:14.950
in the stadium of aek Athens.

54:15.110 --> 54:21.140
We looked upon them as being almost like
pioneering adventures for us, you know?

54:24.430 --> 54:26.150
<i>Interviewer: There's more
sort of gamesmanship,</i>

54:26.270 --> 54:29.670
<i>or strange form of gamesmanship with these
foreign sides, though off the pitch, Brian.</i>

54:30.110 --> 54:34.090
Oh, yes. They, they throw everything at
you, apart from literally the kitchen sink

54:34.110 --> 54:36.630
and if they could get away with that,
they would do that also.

54:37.110 --> 54:40.950
You scored four goals for the national
side against Finland yesterday, mavrus.

54:41.070 --> 54:43.060
Can you score four goals
against Peter shilton?

54:43.350 --> 54:49.030
It was our first experience of the
hostility that you can find in Europe.

54:49.310 --> 54:51.970
<i>Anderson: I think it was Archie gemmill,
or somebody like that, saying,</i>

54:51.990 --> 54:55.140
it's an intimidating atmosphere, Athens.

54:55.510 --> 54:57.190
<i>Woodcock: These greeks,
they're a dangerous lot.</i>

54:57.310 --> 55:01.690
<i>You know, you've gotta watch it here tonight.
They could be turning up in front of the gates.</i>

55:01.710 --> 55:03.310
<i>It's a good job we've got security here.</i>

55:03.430 --> 55:06.030
We stayed somewhere
on the beach and we had little chalets,

55:06.150 --> 55:10.150
and I was in with Tony woodcock.
And I remember going back to my room early.

55:10.630 --> 55:14.470
Ten to 15, 20 minutes later,
there was a complete power cut.

55:14.670 --> 55:17.530
And the lights go out.
And I'm thinking, "ooh."

55:17.550 --> 55:18.850
And you imagine things then.

55:18.870 --> 55:20.860
And before I get to the room,
he could hear me coming.

55:20.990 --> 55:23.010
I was stuck in the toilet,
'cause I was scared,

55:23.030 --> 55:26.370
in the toilet thinking,
"are they coming to get us?"

55:26.390 --> 55:29.490
"Who's there?" You know,
and I knock on the door.

55:29.510 --> 55:31.660
"Who's there? Keep out!" You know?

55:32.550 --> 55:34.850
Well, I thought this, 'cause everyone says
they intimidate

55:34.870 --> 55:38.340
and they'd do anything to get three points.
I'm thinking, "they're coming to get me."

55:38.550 --> 55:40.670
<i>If Brian clough and Peter Taylor
want to learn a new trick</i>

55:40.830 --> 55:44.750
for their managerial repertoire when they come
to Athens, then they, like the rest of us,

55:44.870 --> 55:47.550
will find that you can always learn
from the ancient greeks.

55:48.350 --> 55:50.330
<i>Clark: Their stadium
was amazing, you know?</i>

55:50.350 --> 55:54.710
I mean, they really do get into their football
over there and they do get very excited.

55:55.030 --> 55:59.070
<i>Bowyer: There was a real aggression
that germinated from the terracing...</i>

55:59.870 --> 56:01.230
But we got a good result.

56:01.390 --> 56:04.910
People talk about the crowd, but I've never
seen a spectator actually score a goal.

56:05.030 --> 56:08.250
You know? And that was one of my moments
of glory in the away game.

56:08.270 --> 56:11.730
<i>Actually it's probably the only time in, in
all the time I played with John robertson</i>

56:11.750 --> 56:13.580
<i>that I actually ran past him.</i>

56:13.830 --> 56:15.210
Was it frank Clark got forward?

56:15.230 --> 56:17.950
I think he got a nosebleed, you know,
'cause he got that far forward.

56:18.070 --> 56:20.210
<i>Clark: For some reason,
i gave the ball to John and thought,</i>

56:20.230 --> 56:22.650
<i>"I'll keep on running here,
i might just surprise everyone."</i>

56:22.670 --> 56:26.570
I did keep on running and I got, I got
right through with the ball and then got

56:26.590 --> 56:29.950
very near the goal and then kind of looked
around and thought, "help!"

56:30.110 --> 56:33.740
He's crossed the ball for me and it's come
to me, I could have put it in first time,

56:33.870 --> 56:36.940
but for some reason I didn't, I took a
touch, that sidestepped the keeper,

56:37.070 --> 56:38.250
<i>then put it in the empty net.</i>

56:38.270 --> 56:40.950
<i>I think John mcgovern scored
the other one and he didn't score many.</i>

56:41.070 --> 56:43.210
<i>A quick look at the bench to see
if I was gonna get a rollocking</i>

56:43.230 --> 56:45.540
for being that far
forward, you know, but...

56:46.430 --> 56:49.580
They were no mugs.
They put us to the sword in the second half

56:49.710 --> 56:54.910
and they only got one back, but it was
great to take a lead back to Nottingham.

57:01.550 --> 57:04.110
It is a very good team...

57:05.990 --> 57:08.270
And he plays a very good football.

57:09.550 --> 57:12.070
Erm, there are many good players.

57:12.270 --> 57:15.090
<i>Shilton:
Puskas arrives with the aek team.</i>

57:15.110 --> 57:18.090
<i>They did a little warm up. I thought,
"I'll stay and watch him a little bit."</i>

57:18.110 --> 57:21.660
And he's hitting shots from the edge
of the box and he's just hitting every one

57:21.790 --> 57:25.500
in the top corner of the net and
the goalkeepers couldn't get near them.

57:25.630 --> 57:27.990
<i>And I think he was trying to show off
a little bit, 'cause I thought,</i>

57:28.110 --> 57:30.790
"well that's not really building
the goalkeeper's confidence up."

57:30.950 --> 57:33.470
<i>Commentator: Puskas, who played
for Hungary at Wembley</i>

57:33.590 --> 57:38.650
<i>25 years ago this month, in the match the
Hungarians won six-three against england</i>

57:38.670 --> 57:41.450
<i>and then wrote his name
all over the European cup.</i>

57:41.470 --> 57:45.330
<i>First as a player with real Madrid,
and then as the manager of the Greek club,</i>

57:45.350 --> 57:50.030
<i>panathinaikos, who reached
the final at Wembley in 1971.</i>

57:50.470 --> 57:53.270
<i>And maybe that support
is also for Brian clough.</i>

59:19.590 --> 59:22.930
Interviewer: Well you're obviously the best
player in what is a poor Birmingham team,

59:22.950 --> 59:26.410
but do you really think
you're worth one million pounds?

59:26.430 --> 59:31.430
Well, I went in to see Brian clough and i
says, er, I said, "I'm gonna get married."

59:31.630 --> 59:35.470
He says, "again?" I says, "yeah." He says,

59:36.790 --> 59:38.940
"okay. What do you think
of Trevor Francis?"

59:39.110 --> 59:41.630
<i>I say, "he's a good player.
Good player. Very good."</i>

59:42.230 --> 59:44.430
He said, "we're gonna sign him."
I says, "good."

59:54.990 --> 59:56.450
I've not put in a transfer request.

59:56.470 --> 59:59.290
Interviewer: No, but you want to go.
You want to leave the club don't you?

59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.110
Erm, well, I, I'd rather not say, Gary.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:04.810
<i>Interviewer: What does the prospect of
playing for Brian clough feel like to you?</i>

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:09.110
<i>Francis: Erm, it appeals to me very much.
I've always, er, respected Brian.</i>

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:12.110
Except when he told me
to take my hands out of my pockets.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.090
Young man, to be the best in anything,

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.790
you've got to be the best among
what you've seen there,

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:21.510
it's got to be very special.
Get your hands out your pockets.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:26.510
He's got a tremendous record and if I get
the opportunity, I'd love to speak to him.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:30.850
You know I felt at the time that
it's a great opportunity for me,

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:34.340
<i>'cause they were the only team in the league
who could actually compete with liverpool.</i>

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.700
You know, I've not won anything yet.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.550
I've always hoped that things would change.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.630
You know, the club has progressed to
the quarter finals of the European cup.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:47.150
I know it's been said so many times, but i
don't think any player is worth one million.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.940
<i>To go and pay a million pounds you know,
was a real statement of intent. It was,</i>

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.510
I think it was two or three times the
record fee before that, you know.

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:58.810
<i>Francis: This was the biggest day
in my, er, footballing career</i>

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:02.690
<i>and we were on the verge of,
you know, breaking the transfer record,</i>

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:06.070
<i>bearing in mind that the, the
current record was only 500,000.</i>

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.810
<i>So it was actually doubling it.
I remember the chairman, er,</i>

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:14.030
popping his head into the door,
asking Brian how the negotiations,

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.980
how were they going.

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:20.710
"Mr chairman, when I have something to tell
you, I shall let you know. Now get out."

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.530
I put that there just in case
he makes a balls of it.

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.050
Brian ran the club, er, in those days.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:31.380
And it had to be on a money in equals money
out basis every year, you know?

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.910
There was no, er, rich sugar daddy

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.570
coming and chucking
millions of pounds into the club.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:38.530
<i>It just wasn't run that way.</i>

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.010
Journalist: Now what is it that makes
Trevor worth a million pounds to you?

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:43.670
Clough: His ability, young man.

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:46.570
Journalist:
What do you expect him to do for forest?

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.060
Basically to score goals and be
part and parcel of a good side.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.890
You know, I was familiar with making
back page headlines,

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.550
but this was front page headlines.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.770
Journalist: Do you feel that having
that millions pounds tag round your neck

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.510
will be a burden in your
playing career now?

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:06.790
Erm, I hope not. At the moment it certainly
isn't. I'm quite excited about it.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.790
But, erm, I realise that
what I get on that pitch,

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.470
I've gotta forget about it then
and just get on with playing.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:15.910
That's the most important factor.

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:19.590
<i>Clark: There was no question that Trevor
was a top class player.</i>

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:23.590
<i>So it was a real statement of intent.
It gave us the players a lift.</i>

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.270
<i>Obviously one or two people who were
looking at it players thinking,</i>

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:28.150
<i>"oh, I hope he's not gonna get my place."</i>

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:31.580
But I knew he wasn't gonna play
left back but...

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.950
So yeah, it gave the club
a lift without doubt.

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:38.270
There were some big players there.
The likes of gemmill and shilton

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:43.670
and woodcock and robertson, and it was
just such an honour for me, you know,

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:45.150
to be amongst these players.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.810
Journalist: And when do you expect
to play your first game for forest?

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.630
Clough: When I pick him.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:56.090
It wasn't that easy, you know, because
i joined the club in the month of February,

01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.990
and it was obviously just over
halfway through the season.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:04.350
He wasn't in the team for about three
or four weeks. He was on the bench.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.950
Taylor: Do you want them
signing or not? No?

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:09.010
Clough: He's done it.
No, he's done it once. It's done.

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:15.270
Whoever was sub, if I wanted a cup
of tea, he'll get me a cup of tea.

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:19.260
<i>And cloughy walked in with Trevor
behind him. He says, "what are you doing?"</i>

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.470
"Nothing." "What's that in your hand?"
I said, "cup of tea."

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.860
"Put that back. Put that back."

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:29.140
So I get up, put it down.
He turned to Trevor and he said,

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:31.330
"Trevor, you get him a cup of tea.

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.820
<i>"'Cause you've done bugger all for
45 minutes, so that's your job."</i>

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:40.940
Unpredictable, er, ruthless,
erm, quite brilliant at his job.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:45.510
Erm, he could be quite eccentric at times,
but he was bordering on being a genius.

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:48.710
<i>Commentator:
And you notice straight away</i>

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:52.300
<i>that Peter Taylor is leading out
Nottingham forest.</i>

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:58.190
<i>Where is Brian clough? It's his right-hand
man Peter Taylor, who gets the honour.</i>

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.390
I discussed it with Peter about a week ago
and I said to him, I said,

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.050
<i>you know, he needs exercise
more than I do, Brian.</i>

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:07.030
I play squash and he's putting weight
on like... I'm only kidding.

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:08.510
<i>I discussed it with him
a week ago and I said,</i>

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:13.190
"it would do you good to get out with them
this time." They wouldn't let us both go out.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.660
<i>Commentator: Going all the way... birtles!</i>

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:21.750
If it means teaching players good habits, if
it means giving them pride in themselves,

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:26.370
<i>if it means abiding by a few
little rules and if we have discipline</i>

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:29.430
<i>running right through the club,
so they can come back at half time</i>

01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:33.180
and win cup finals, then they want me
every day of the week.

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:36.730
<i>Clark: We felt at halftime you know, that
if we could just step it up a little bit,</i>

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.550
we could win the game,
and that's the way it went.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.530
Interviewer: 400 games was it? Or more
for newcastle and a free transfer in '75.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.780
You could never have thought that all this

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.530
was gonna happen to you
at Nottingham forest.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:50.730
No, no, I was quite pleased to get fixed
up in the second division at the time.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:53.060
Never mind thinking
about coming here, you know?

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.580
<i>Clough: I thought frank Clark was
the best player on the field today.</i>

01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:00.070
His consistency was a credit to him
and an example to everybody else.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:21.290
People were saying, "grasshoppers of Europe
beat real Madrid." You know, "come on."

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:25.250
<i>Commentator: That's a useful ball and Mayer's
first time ball was meant for sulzer</i>

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:29.770
<i>and that wasn't a bad one either
and sulzer gets in here for grasshoppers!</i>

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:33.790
<i>And well, don't say forest weren't warned.</i>

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:39.780
Yeah, it was very, very close.
I think it was only like one each,

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.510
<i>it might have been two one to us
with very little time to go.</i>

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:48.950
<i>Commentator: There are three minutes
to go and forest badly want the third goal.</i>

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:52.950
<i>Here's gemmill! Archie gemmill!</i>

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:57.470
And we nicked two in the last minute to
make it really four-one convincing.

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:00.790
Gave us a real platform to go over there.

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:05.500
<i>O'Neill: And boy did we not need those goals?
Really did. They gave us a torrid time.</i>

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:07.710
<i>I think they scored a penalty
after about 20 minutes.</i>

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:12.010
<i>Commentator: Sulzer versus shilton.
Yes! Grasshoppers one-nothing...</i>

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:15.500
It was very, very hostile
surprisingly, for me, in Zurich.

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:21.170
I didn't expect the Swiss to be as volatile
as they were on the night.

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.820
<i>O'Neill: It was hard work out
playing there. It really was.</i>

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:28.810
John would get the ball on the left hand
side, as he was entitled to get it,

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:33.950
<i>because he was a genius. My job was
to try and get into the back post.</i>

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:38.850
I'm doing all these runs back and
forward there. No one has noticed these.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:42.830
I'm every bit as tired as, as they are,
where you're doing the work down there,

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:46.540
but I have to do all this, called doggies
in the game. So clough and Taylor

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.490
<i>were roaring at me in this game against
grasshoppers to get into the penalty area.</i>

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:53.070
<i>Commentator: With the cross,
O'Neill! Yes!</i>

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:56.030
<i>Well, that has shocked the crowd here.</i>

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:59.750
They were full of praise for me getting
into the penalty area in the first place,

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:03.890
right into the penalty box, but I think
they were particularly pleased themselves

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:08.050
that they had told me to get in there
and said that if they hadn't done,

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:11.070
I might not have done it. I would
have done, 'cause that's what I did.

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:25.540
Interviewer: I know you always try

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.410
and keep your feet on the ground
at this club, but are you not beginning

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:32.350
to think about the possibility of really
winning the European cup outright now?

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:37.390
We, we always, we always think of
winning any competition we're in.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.950
It suits us actually to be playing the
Germans in one sense of the word,

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:45.570
because I think they play nearest to English
football out of anybody that we know.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:49.450
Erm, how they'll compare to liverpool, i
don't quite know. I don't think they'll be

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:53.260
as good as liverpool, 'cause I think
liverpool are as good a side in Europe

01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:55.780
as they have proved in the last two years.

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.570
Interviewer: So, from your point of view,

01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:59.740
what worries would
you have playing Cologne?

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:04.610
The build up to the game, it's england
against Germany, so it's, it's gonna be, er,

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:05.770
<i>nip and tuck.</i>

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:10.260
Cologne were the best team in Germany
and favourites to win the title

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.110
<i>after real Madrid had gone out.</i>

01:08:12.270 --> 01:08:16.270
<i>O'Neill: You're playing in the semi-final
of the European cup</i>

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.090
<i>and it's moments like this here
that you thought,</i>

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:21.810
"well I wonder how puskas and di Stefano and
all those players all felt about matches."

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:26.149
<i>Clough: It is essential you do well at
home. All is not lost if you don't win</i>

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.790
by a two, or three, four goal margin, but
it is essential you put up a good display

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:33.510
and take a lead to the opposition's camp.

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:39.979
And the one thing we'll have to conquer, and
we didn't do it against Zurich was our nerves.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:44.970
I don't think on the night I've ever been
so ready to play football.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:50.830
Peter had gone to see Cologne play
and he said, "listen, don't fear them."

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:56.470
I think the English player pound for pound,
temperament wise, skill wise, physical wise,

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.170
I think is the best in the world,
without a shadow of a doubt.

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:00.870
He said,
"the two things I look at,

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:02.649
<i>"can they head the ball?
They can't head the ball.</i>

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:05.170
"Are they quick? No.

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:07.340
"They've got no pace in the team."
He said, "we'll murder them."

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.130
<i>Commentator: It's kanaka,
muller is free over the far side.</i>

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:12.370
Has he seen him?
Yes he has.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:16.550
I started the game as a left back
and Archie gemmill got injured,

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.649
I went into midfield and frank came on.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.390
And we were all over the
place, defensively.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.029
<i>Mcgovern: Our normal game is you know,</i>

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:25.340
we'll hustle the opposition,
we'll rush them off their feet.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:28.170
But, I didn't realise
how good Cologne were on the break.

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:30.340
<i>O'Neil: They're the quickest team
we've ever played,</i>

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.700
and the pitch has not
bothered them one jot.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:35.340
I think we almost gave a
collective look over to Taylor.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.310
As if to say, "what are you on about?"

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.050
<i>Commentator:
Through ball for glowacz.</i>

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:45.700
<i>Glowacz being chased by needham,
that's a good ball into Van gool.</i>

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.890
<i>Good drive and a goal!</i>

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.029
<i>Yes!</i>

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:53.430
<i>Van gool, and that is a dramatic goal.</i>

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:56.010
<i>And once again Cologne break,</i>

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:58.850
<i>and the long striding
Herbert neumann has a look,</i>

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.430
<i>and finds Van gool and he's all right.</i>

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:04.430
<i>It's one against one, Van
gool against shilton</i>

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.590
<i>and now it's muller to
score goal number two.</i>

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:11.230
<i>Oh, my goodness me,
forest are in real trouble.</i>

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:12.750
Two-nil down, that was a shock.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.690
You know, maybe we're not as good
as we think we are.

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.410
<i>Man: We've chucked everything at them,
but we're two-nil down.</i>

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:21.580
<i>Shilton: Two break aways,
and I was just in a daze really.</i>

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.230
And there was just so much
going on in the game,

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.570
it was end to end.

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:26.950
It was gonna be a goal,
it was going to be a goal.

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:31.780
Everything that,
that you thought football could be.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.890
<i>Woodcock:
I think Roger Van gool went through,</i>

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:36.770
<i>and he clipped it just wide of the post.</i>

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.250
'Cause we would have been
dead and buried at three, I'm sure.

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.250
<i>Commentator: He's in for a chance...</i>

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.630
<i>Oh, and he's just wide!</i>

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:46.310
<i>And he holds his head in his hands.</i>

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.950
Again, all we need is one goal
and we'll get back in the match.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.900
<i>Commentator: Needham...</i>

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.570
<i>And it's looking for birtles!</i>

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.570
<i>And that was a beautiful goal
from garry birtles.</i>

01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:04.310
We got a goal back just before half time.

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.770
<i>Commentator: Scored his first
European cup goal against liverpool.</i>

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.830
<i>Two-one now to Cologne.</i>

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:11.670
I scored a goal.

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:14.130
<i>Commentator: Good chip...
Birtles knocks it down...</i>

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:16.620
<i>And bowyer scores the goal!</i>

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.110
<i>Beautifully constructed
goal for Ian bowyer.</i>

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:24.190
<i>This man of all parts, man of all seasons.</i>

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:25.910
<i>It's two-two.</i>

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.390
John robertson believe it, or not,
scored with a header.

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:32.350
<i>Commentator:
Here's woodcock... mcgovern...</i>

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.270
<i>There goes birtles...</i>

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:37.630
<i>Turns and oh, it's great!</i>

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.310
<i>And a superb goal!</i>

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:40.990
<i>John robertson!</i>

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:43.510
He never heads a goal in his life,

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:46.310
and he's dived full length,
diving header, in the bottom corner.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.110
So you think,
"something's happening here."

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:51.830
<i>Commentator:
What a fantastic goal by John robertson.</i>

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:56.700
<i>Three-two Nottingham forest.
17 minutes into the second half.</i>

01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:02.710
<i>Cologne wants to make a substitution
and bring on their Japanese international.</i>

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:08.510
<i>Shilton: I hadn't really had a lot to do,
even though I'd let two goals in.</i>

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.530
I remember he got the ball
on the edge of the box

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.470
towards the end of the game
and he turned and hit a shot...

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:19.660
And I was expecting it to skid.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.850
<i>Commentator: Oh! Oh, my goodness me!</i>

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:27.670
<i>What a way to come on as a substitute.</i>

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:34.220
<i>O'Neill: It's a bad goal to give away.</i>

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.750
<i>It's a terrible moment.</i>

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.590
But from the position
that we were in at two-nil,

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:40.980
we would have taken the three-three.

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:43.570
Just couldn't believe it.
Absolutely gutted.

01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:50.030
I am content with this result. I think
it is a good basis for the next leg.

01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:53.090
<i>Mcgovern: A three-three draw,
in one of the best atmospheres</i>

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:56.230
<i>I think I ever remember
playing at the city ground.</i>

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:58.350
Just an incredible atmosphere that night.

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:02.710
<i>O'Neill: I honestly felt,
when I've come in, that I'd played in</i>

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:07.870
just about the most
atmospheric game imaginable.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.610
<i>Shilton: I must admit though,
it was a bit embarrassing,</i>

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:12.620
<i>the next morning
when I picked the newspaper up,</i>

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:16.270
and the headline went,
"Japanese sub sinks shilton."

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:19.050
Despite us, you know,
managing to get back into the game

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:21.570
and drawing the game,
because they've scored three away goals,

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:24.190
we've got to go and win, in Cologne.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.780
We're despondent obviously,
not going to Cologne with a lead,

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.930
but far from out of any competition.

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:49.250
This is where cloughy comes into his own.

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:51.450
He says, "listen, this
game is not over yet."

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:54.780
He says, "don't anybody be so silly
to think we're out of this.

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:56.390
"We'll go there and win."

01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:59.270
I hope anybody's not stupid enough
to write us off.

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:00.770
<i>Mcgovern: And that was it.</i>

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:02.970
A lingering stare into the camera,

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:05.300
just to make sure everybody's got it,
you know?

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.330
<i>Robertson: I really thought he meant it.</i>

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.500
<i>Burns: And he kept on saying it to us.</i>

01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:11.130
<i>"We'll win out there. No problem."</i>

01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:12.770
We always think we can win.

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:14.770
Genuinely, we always think we can win.

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:20.010
And the way they defended
having got two goal start,

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:22.020
they didn't over impress us either.

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:24.030
It was always, "you're better than them."

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:27.650
It made you feel a million dollars you
know, "we are better than the opposition."

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.290
We did believe we could get a result.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.450
We're gonna win this game.
We're gonna go through to the final.

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:33.850
That's the only language
they understand, sir.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:36.350
You see, they don't like it up 'em,
they do not like it up 'em.

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.530
Interviewer: You don't think
it'll go wrong then, like it did at home.

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:52.990
By hell, I hope not!

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.540
I've had enough of three
goals going past us

01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:58.790
to last me to the next five years,
let alone the next match.

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:05.550
<i>Commentator: The referee,
Nicola serenier of Romania,</i>

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:07.500
<i>gets the second leg under way,</i>

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:11.710
<i>with forest commencing a straightforward,
if not simple task.</i>

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:15.010
<i>They need their 13th away win of the season</i>

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:17.070
<i>and they have 90 minutes to achieve it.</i>

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.730
By the time that we got to Germany,
we felt that if we don't concede early,

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.060
we will, we can win this game.

01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:26.230
<i>Commentator: Muller...</i>

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:29.890
They had a chance really early on,
with a boy called dieter muller.

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:31.550
<i>- And he missed the target.
- Commentator: Oh!</i>

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:34.410
Again, it's a cup match
and you need all the rub of the green.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:35.550
We were under the cosh.

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:37.740
<i>Birtles: It's all about concentration
at the highest level.</i>

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:40.410
If you switch off,
lose concentration for a second,

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:42.110
you get torn apart.

01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:43.730
They only needed the draw,

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.550
<i>or one-one or two-two,
was still good enough for them.</i>

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.530
I'm not sure that they knew after a while,
what to do themselves

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:52.780
and I think that we sensed
that uncertainty about them

01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:54.230
<i>during the course of the match.</i>

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:57.530
<i>Clark: It put a doubt in their minds,
you know."How shall we approach this?</i>

01:15:57.550 --> 01:16:00.610
<i>"We're at home, shall we go
and play our usual game,</i>

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:03.730
<i>"where we have to take the initiative
and attack teams,</i>

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:07.570
<i>"and risk conceding a goal, or shall
we just sit back and keep it tight?"</i>

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:10.050
<i>And sometimes those things
can play on people's minds.</i>

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:13.290
I've seen it happen many,
many times in two-leg football.

01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:16.590
<i>Commentator: O'Neill!
Oh, he really thumped that.</i>

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:21.710
<i>Really got hold of that Martin O'Neill
and came in very sharply.</i>

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:23.910
<i>As we reach half time...</i>

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:27.460
<i>Forest in going for the victory
that they must have,</i>

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.780
<i>got to guard against
leaving themselves too bare at the back.</i>

01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:34.110
<i>The game swings from one end, to the other.</i>

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:38.750
<i>But they've got to gamble because
they need the victory, Cologne don't.</i>

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:41.470
<i>And he hits it straight at shilton.</i>

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:45.110
<i>Mcgovern: We played well
as a unit who had to defend</i>

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.830
when we needed to defend, but we still
had that ability to get a goal.

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.630
<i>Commentator:
Cologne in their fifth European semi-final.</i>

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.950
<i>They've never been further.</i>

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:57.350
<i>O'Neill: And here,
we get the chance for the corner kick.</i>

01:16:57.470 --> 01:17:00.310
We might not be able to force
that many great openings

01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.310
during the course of the match,
this is an opportunity.

01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:04.790
<i>Commentator:
They look a little bit worried.</i>

01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:07.830
John robertson took the corner
and chipped it into the near post.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.350
Garry birtles has just got
in front of the defender...

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:13.850
And I headed the thing into the net.

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.330
<i>Commentator: There's bowyer!
Yes, he's done it!</i>

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:19.030
One-nil, that's all we need.
One goal's enough for us.

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.870
I actually misheaded it,
but don't tell anybody.

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.140
<i>Commentator: Played in so many places
for Nottingham forest.</i>

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:25.500
You can sense that victory.

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:38.180
Holding on to the last 20 minutes, erm,
was something that I felt

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:40.970
<i>we were as strong as
any side in Europe to do.</i>

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.170
<i>Commentator:
The referee looking at his watch,</i>

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:47.370
<i>and Nottingham forest are
in the European cup final.</i>

01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:49.670
<i>Having beaten liverpool,</i>

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:53.500
<i>they've carried on from there
to keep the English flag in the final,</i>

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:54.890
<i>for the third year running.</i>

01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:58.050
That one-nil win in Cologne to me,

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:01.350
was as important as any game
we played in Europe.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:05.890
It's what it meant, you know,
every round was a new adventure.

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:09.190
Every round it was the furthest,
obviously, that the club had ever been.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:13.190
<i>Commentator: By Ian bowyer
in the 64th minute of the match.</i>

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:17.750
It was unreal. It was unreal. It was...
Everybody was living in a dream.

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.710
<i>Bowyer: Two or three seasons before,
we were in the second division.</i>

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:22.470
Mid-table, second division team.

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:26.710
It's, you know, it's just unheard of.
It really is fairy-tale stuff.

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.590
<i>Commentator: He's done it!</i>

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:31.930
After we played in Nottingham,

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:33.790
not many people thought
we were going to do it,

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.230
but I did.

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.050
Interviewer:
Deep down you were still sure?

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:40.380
Well I said to you after the match,
that anybody who thought

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:42.570
we were out of this
competition were stupid.

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.420
I hope he doesn't mean us!

01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:00.460
I thought to myself, "well that's
it, I'm playing in a cup final."

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.530
<i>Robertson: I always remembered
the European cup final in 1960.</i>

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:12.150
<i>Real Madrid versus, er, eintract Frankfurt.</i>

01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:16.610
<i>O'Hare: Dominguez, marquitos, pachin,
vidal, santamaria, zarraga, canario,</i>

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:18.780
del sol, di stÃ©fano, puskas, gento.

01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:20.270
And puskas scoring four.

01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.810
I thought European cups were for him,
and people like him.

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:28.450
<i>Burns: I'm from Glasgow
and I played in the streets</i>

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:32.310
and never ever in my lifetime did I ever
think I'd get to a European cup final.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:34.610
<i>Robertson: God, you think
you could be European champions.</i>

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:36.310
It's something you dream about.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.350
<i>Shilton: We were favourites, you know.</i>

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:45.830
<i>Going into it, the pressure was on us
and, you know, it was gonna be a real test.</i>

01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:49.170
<i>Mcgovern: It's difficult
to remember your actual feelings,</i>

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.770
<i>because you're kind of
thinking about, okay,</i>

01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:53.610
<i>we're going to Munich
for the European cup final.</i>

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:56.650
<i>First thing I wanna make sure is
that I'm in the side.</i>

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.290
Am I gonna be playing?

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.190
Because there's always
competition for places.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:08.670
<i>Clark: I think it was something like
our 70th game, or something, of the season.</i>

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:12.830
And we only had a squad of 15 or 16,
you know, erm...

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:17.970
All this resting players
and picking a totally different team

01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:21.030
<i>for one game after the other, that was...
That never happened in those days.</i>

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:27.370
<i>O'Neill: This rotation business that
we have, erm... it wasn't for us.</i>

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:31.550
You became massively disappointed
if you were left out for a minute.

01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:33.550
<i>You became every bit as disappointed,</i>

01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:36.650
<i>if you were ever taken off
in a game as well too, you know.</i>

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.050
You've gotta play in finals.

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:41.890
If you're not playing in it,
then no point in celebrating.

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:43.550
<i>All right, you're happy for everybody,</i>

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:46.690
<i>but if you're not actually playing in it,
then you're not part of it.</i>

01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:48.730
We knew Trevor was gonna play.

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:51.330
That was the first game in Europe
that he was eligible for.

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:52.710
<i>There was no doubt that he was gonna play.</i>

01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:54.570
<i>Francis: I've got something
to thank uefa for,</i>

01:20:54.590 --> 01:21:00.030
because the rules permitted anyone
that signed when I signed,

01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:04.190
during the season, if the team progressed
to the final, they could play in the final.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:07.690
<i>Clark: Myself, Martin O'Neill
and Archie, Archie gemmill,</i>

01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:09.910
had all had niggling injuries.

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.890
<i>Nothing serious, but niggling injuries.</i>

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:17.210
I got injured in the first leg of
the semi-final, and he said to me,

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:22.390
"if you get yourself fit son,
you'll play in the final. If you're not..."

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:25.030
<i>I got myself fit.</i>

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:28.090
The three of us were training
and we were all looking at each other

01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:30.730
<i>because we all knew
we had a chance of playing.</i>

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:33.900
<i>I could play left back,
and Ian bowyer would be in midfield,</i>

01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:37.230
<i>and Trevor would be wide on the right,
and that would be the team.</i>

01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:39.790
I never knew that I was
gonna play in that final,

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:41.790
<i>up until the day of the game.</i>

01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.910
<i>Bowyer: Clough actually
walked past me, and quietly said to me,</i>

01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:47.730
<i>"i was gonna have
a game of tennis with you today,</i>

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:49.310
<i>"but you're playing tomorrow."</i>

01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:50.580
Quietly.

01:21:50.710 --> 01:21:52.430
<i>Clark: Martin could
look at the team and think well,</i>

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:53.910
<i>"Trevor's gonna play, so I won't be there.</i>

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:57.590
<i>"Well I could play in central midfield
and Ian bowyer could play at left back."</i>

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:58.950
And Archie was thinking the same,

01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:03.150
"well I can play in midfield
and Ian bowyer can play left back."

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:06.270
<i>And fortunately, he had picked me.</i>

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:11.310
<i>Mcgovern: Both players
have told the manager they're 100% fit.</i>

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:15.820
<i>Shilton: He says, "well, that's great news,
because you're both on the bench."</i>

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:19.980
When he announced the team
and I wasn't in it,

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:23.980
<i>there were very harsh words said by both.</i>

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:28.670
He went with frank,
'cause frank was closer to fitness.

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:31.940
Archie and Martin were
devastated, obviously.

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.460
Archie so bad that he
left the club, you know.

01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:36.630
He didn't play another game for forest.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.670
He got rid of me the following season,
to Birmingham.

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:46.830
<i>Clark: I would have been devastated.</i>

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:50.310
I mean, I was really sorry for the two lads
'cause you know, I like them both,

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.950
but you know, that's life really.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.170
<i>Francis: I was very fortunate.</i>

01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:08.370
You know, to have that opportunity
of making my debut in Europe,

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:10.300
in a European competition, in the final.

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:49.570
You have to remember, again, I came in '73

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:54.380
where forest's average attendance would be
something, only like 12,000 or 13,000,

01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:58.550
and there were 20,000 people
who'd made the journey to Munich.

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:02.250
<i>Lloyd: So many tales
about people getting to the final.</i>

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:06.090
<i>My own brother, you know,
he worked for rolls Royce.</i>

01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:08.910
He jumped a cargo plane in Bristol.

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.250
<i>Francis: I've been surprised, you know,</i>

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:15.090
<i>in years gone by
just at how many football supporters,</i>

01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:16.890
<i>not necessarily
Nottingham forest supporters,</i>

01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:19.110
<i>who actually came to
support Nottingham forest.</i>

01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:24.610
<i>Lloyd: People hitching, people cycling,
people going to these European matches.</i>

01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:27.210
And I think the city grew up with the team.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:28.590
The weather was fabulous.

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:32.610
I'm sure there were literally hundreds
of Nottingham people

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:36.100
<i>that slept in the grounds
of the olympic stadium in Munich.</i>

01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:37.570
<i>Davies: As we look round the stadium now,</i>

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:39.740
<i>we can see that they're outnumbering
the supporters of malmo.</i>

01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:41.770
<i>Something like two to one.</i>

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:44.890
They are very conscious, as I said,
that they carry the torch,

01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:49.250
and they intend to be the third English
side to win this European cup.

01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.630
And that will be a record.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.980
<i>Francis: We're all sat about,
waiting for the last one to come down.</i>

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:55.830
<i>And that last one was garry birtles.</i>

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:57.990
<i>Garry comes down and he's not shaving,</i>

01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:01.150
<i>he's got a couple of days growth,
or whatever, again.</i>

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:03.770
<i>Francis: And Brian clough said to him...</i>

01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:05.810
"What's that on your face?"
I said, "what do you mean?"

01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:07.950
He said, "round your chin."

01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:12.150
"When I sweat and I've had a shave,
you know, I get really sore,

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.620
"and it irritates me and it distracts me."

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:17.650
"Get upstairs, and get it shaved off now!"

01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:20.310
"Five minutes, otherwise
you're not playing."

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:22.770
He was back within five minutes.

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:25.990
He's got a piece of paper here,
piece of paper there, piece of paper there.

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.930
It was lucky
he hadn't cut his throat really.

01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:30.450
<i>Francis: I think that was done purposely.</i>

01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:32.150
<i>Birtles: He can see how nervous you are.</i>

01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:35.290
<i>Said, "right I've gotta take him out
of the situation he's in at the moment.</i>

01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:37.010
<i>"Just take his mind off it."</i>

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:38.810
Again, great man management.

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:41.690
<i>Francis: We talked,
i was gonna say very little.</i>

01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:44.690
<i>We talked, in fact,
not at all about the opposition.</i>

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:47.020
What an atmosphere.
What a time.

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:51.020
<i>You know, the pitch was magnificent.
Everything was magnificent.</i>

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:52.980
<i>Woodcock: It's called the foehn.</i>

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:56.490
<i>And it's a hot wind that
comes down from the mountains</i>

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:59.650
<i>that changes the atmosphere
a little bit and stuff like that.</i>

01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:01.710
And it was a really sticky night.

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:05.170
<i>Francis: And I just felt that, you know,</i>

01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:09.820
I had to justify my selection,
by playing at an extra level.

01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:12.690
<i>Commentator: With Nottingham forest</i>

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:17.870
<i>about to get
the 24th European cup final underway.</i>

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:23.490
<i>Attacking the goal to the right
and lining up with two forwards,</i>

01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:26.580
<i>although robertson was out on the far side.</i>

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:28.590
<i>Here's birtles...</i>

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:34.170
The land of the giants they were. All
over six foot, managed by an englishman.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.030
Very well organised.
Really difficult to break down.

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:42.010
I think they had one half chance
when, on a rare attack,

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:46.090
Kenny burns, who was magnificent,
made a rare error

01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:47.690
<i>when he misheaded a header back to me,</i>

01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:49.590
<i>and one of their players got in between us.</i>

01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:52.930
<i>Commentator: Burns...
Oh he's given it away to kinnvall!</i>

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:55.610
<i>And rescued by shilton.</i>

01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:58.550
<i>Kenny burns definitely in two minds then.</i>

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:01.580
<i>Woodcock again, full of industry.</i>

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:05.590
<i>That's mcgovern's shot!</i>

01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:10.570
<i>The most cleanly hit shot of the night.</i>

01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:14.770
Well, I remember the ball being
played out wide to John robertson.

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:18.230
<i>And I was probably a good 40 yards
you know, from goal.</i>

01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:23.470
I felt as if that was the first time
in the half, or up until that point,

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:27.990
<i>where I got a ball
from longer than five, 10 yards away.</i>

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.790
And it nearly went out of play.
I nearly never kept it in.

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:34.170
Malmo had doubled up on him,
so they put two players on him.

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.410
<i>The two players were very close together.</i>

01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:38.290
Well, this is my chance,
I'll have a go here.

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:40.930
If he goes past the full back, which,

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:45.150
there was a good chance he will do,
and delivers a ball and I'm not there,

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:48.690
I'm gonna get another, you know,
dressing down from Brian clough,

01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:51.130
<i>which, you don't need too many of them.</i>

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:52.450
<i>Robertson: Got there and again,</i>

01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:56.790
not looking, or picking anything,
just trying to clip it in there.

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:00.190
<i>Birtles: And I was gonna go for it.</i>

01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:04.350
<i>You can see me on the picture,
sort of hang back a little bit.</i>

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:05.850
<i>'Cause if I'd have gone for it,
I'd have missed it,</i>

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:07.870
<i>because it was too much pace,
I'd have put it wide.</i>

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:13.220
<i>Commentator: Robertson...</i>

01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:32.980
The million pounds is
forgotten immediately.

01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:35.870
Because record breaking fee...

01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:39.030
<i>Scored a goal in the European cup final.</i>

01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:42.710
The best moment
in my footballing career, by far.

01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:45.330
<i>It was just the most magical feeling,
you know?</i>

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:47.820
<i>To see that ball hit the back of the net.</i>

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:52.390
<i>Commentator: Francis, another good run.</i>

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:55.210
<i>Comes from behind birtles
and here's robertson!</i>

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:57.220
<i>And he hits the post!</i>

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.250
<i>Fifteen seconds now,
we make it on the watch,</i>

01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:13.340
<i>to win it by the only goal.</i>

01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:16.610
<i>Not seen too much of this sort of thing
from Anderson,</i>

01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:18.890
<i>just one to remember in the first half.</i>

01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:22.950
<i>But it doesn't matter any more,
Nottingham forest have done it!</i>

01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:33.910
<i>They don't mind about the score.</i>

01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:35.750
<i>They're only concerned about the fact,</i>

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:39.910
<i>that the European cup
has come to Nottingham forest.</i>

01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:09.910
<i>As John mcgovern,
who came off a park pitch in hartlepool</i>

01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:13.980
<i>to follow Brian clough
to all his clubs, except one.</i>

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:18.490
<i>Coming up to receive the trophy
that has many famous names on it,</i>

01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:20.330
<i>from real Madrid forward.</i>

01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:24.350
Well my dad died when I was 11.
He never saw me play football.

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:29.770
<i>When I received the cup,
people said I wasn't smiling.</i>

01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:33.260
I was kind of smiling
but wasn't really over joyous.

01:30:33.710 --> 01:30:35.850
That was the first thing
that came into my head,

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:37.190
I wish my dad was here...

01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:40.170
<i>Commentator: The trophy at the moment,
dwarfing John mcgovern.</i>

01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:43.530
<i>Larry Lloyd, who left liverpool
rather hastily perhaps,</i>

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:44.990
<i>was in the wilderness for some time,</i>

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:49.820
<i>smiles as John mcgovern
holds the European cup aloft.</i>

01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:55.180
<i>And the aims of Brian clough
and Peter Taylor achieved,</i>

01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:57.530
<i>but I'm sure they're not
gonna rest on their laurels.</i>

01:30:57.550 --> 01:31:01.210
<i>That's one of their great secrets,
they don't do anything of that nature.</i>

01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:05.620
<i>They will be planning for the future now,
to hold onto it.</i>

01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:09.210
<i>John robertson has been turned
from an also stroll,</i>

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:12.670
<i>into an international player
by clough and Taylor.</i>

01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:15.050
<i>Trevor Francis just going through.</i>

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.730
<i>Francis, who's gone a very,
very long way tonight</i>

01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:21.310
<i>to justify the money paid for him.</i>

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:26.030
<i>Interviewer: What's it like
playing under clough and Taylor?</i>

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:28.730
<i>They did promise you
that they'd give you trophies.</i>

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:29.850
What can I say?

01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:31.370
You know,
I've been here three and a half months,

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:33.700
and it's worked out perfectly.

01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:35.210
Interviewer: Peter Taylor,
you and Brian clough

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:37.730
have won so many things,
but how does last night rate,

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:39.390
<i>the European cup?</i>

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:42.070
Taylor: Well first of all, Gary,
we've accomplished what we came for.

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:44.330
We're bringing the cup back, number one.

01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:46.650
<i>Clark: It sunk in
as soon as we got off the plane really</i>

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.010
<i>at east Midlands airport, you know?</i>

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:51.070
The crowd were fantastic.

01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:52.590
Interviewer: John,
you've won so many trophies

01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:54.410
under Brian clough and Peter Taylor,

01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:56.370
what's this one like
compared with all the others?

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:58.070
A little bit heavier.

01:31:58.190 --> 01:32:00.210
Obviously very nice to win.

01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:01.930
<i>Interviewer:
But how do you cope with all this success?</i>

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:03.330
<i>I mean, do you just take it in your stride?</i>

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:05.730
<i>Because, I think most people
are staggered at the success</i>

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:07.930
that Nottingham forest
have had in such a short time.

01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:10.690
Well that's due to the management,
you know?

01:32:10.710 --> 01:32:13.610
We've obviously got good management
and we've got good players.

01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.940
<i>We work hard at our jobs
and we get the results.</i>

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:21.370
<i>Needham: I'd spent, sort of,
11, 12 years in the lower divisions,</i>

01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:24.270
<i>but when I got to do all this,
i was really mature.</i>

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:26.780
I could take it all in and enjoy it.

01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:30.290
Some of the younger kids, I don't think
actually knew what was going on.

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:32.050
<i>You know, it was just happening to them.</i>

01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:35.290
We all met at home pierrepoint,
the water sports centre.

01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:37.730
<i>Commentator:
Some four miles from the city centre.</i>

01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:41.410
So we've gone about
a mile and a half from home pierrepoint,

01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:42.930
we hadn't seen a soul.

01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:46.290
We're coming into west bridgford
and of course there's no one about.

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:48.130
Nobody around,
this is gonna be embarrassing.

01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:54.790
Robbo and Larry actually got off the bus
and jogged down the road to a bus stop.

01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:57.250
They were the first two
that actually waved to the bus.

01:32:58.910 --> 01:33:02.750
- Hello?
- There's people, there's people!

01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:05.180
There's bloody people!

01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:29.810
<i>Anderson: We went all over the place
and we saw people</i>

01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:32.370
that you'd never seen for years and years,
coming out to celebrate.

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:34.330
<i>It was just a fantastic time.</i>

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:39.710
Well it's amazing how much football means
to people's lives, at times, you know?

01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:44.350
<i>Women, babies, babies with strips on,
the flags are going.</i>

01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:49.370
That's when it you know,
i realised what this means to the people.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.650
<i>Needham: It brought tears to my eyes.</i>

01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:54.060
I had the most emotional time
I've ever had in football.

01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:01.370
Interviewer: Larry Lloyd,
what do you think of this reception?

01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:05.010
Unbelievable. I didn't think there were
this many people in Nottingham.

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.170
Interviewer: Are you enjoying yourself?

01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:10.490
Absolutely unbelievable, it's, you know,
it's difficult to describe, you know?

01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:14.190
These people are tremendous.
Over you know... beautiful, beautiful.

01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:20.730
Well, that's the moment
where the significance

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:22.550
of what you've achieved really hits home.

01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:26.690
<i>You know, so many people.</i>

01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:30.330
<i>Shilton: Euphoria,
everybody was just overtaken.</i>

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:32.010
You know, we'd put Nottingham on the map.

01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:35.910
It's my town, it's my city,
and I want to be part of it.

01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:42.890
<i>Robertson: I can't put any words.
You know? It was just, just brilliant.</i>

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:45.930
<i>Brilliant.
I can't put it any plainer than that.</i>

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:50.710
You know, you're very...
What's the word, very humble.

01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:53.010
<i>Lloyd: Hey, I like being a hero, all right?</i>

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:54.930
<i>People waving out to me,
when I'm walking around.</i>

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:57.450
I like people coming up to me,
when I'm having a pint.

01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:00.690
"All right, Larry, can I buy you a pint?"
"Well, yeah, yeah you can if you want."

01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.250
I didn't mind that at all.

01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.610
<i>Burns: It was a great time,</i>

01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:07.260
<i>and I would like to think all the supporters
had the time of their life as well.</i>

01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:08.590
I think they went with us.

01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:10.990
They were on that journey with us,
make no mistake.

01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:44.570
<i>Shilton: You know,
for a team to get promotion</i>

01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:47.170
<i>into what is now the premier league,
the old first division,</i>

01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:50.660
and then end up doing what we did,
two European cups.

01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:52.490
It'll never happen again.

01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:55.450
<i>Birtles: That goes down as
possibly one of the greatest achievements,</i>

01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:56.970
I would say in world football.

01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:58.630
<i>Anderson: It was a fantastic time,</i>

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:01.130
<i>and obviously we're talking about it
now 35 years on,</i>

01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:05.430
it's a great achievement and I hold
the medals very dear to my heart.

01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:40.170
<i>Robertson: They were brilliant together.</i>

01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:43.370
<i>Besides a massive knowledge of the game
they were great company,</i>

01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:46.390
and they could make you laugh.
They were brilliant people.

01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:55.210
<i>O'Neill: There was a change
when that man stepped into Nottingham.</i>

01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:58.860
And it was almost like getting on a train
and just not getting off.

01:37:57.550 --> 01:38:00.370
<i>Clough: You can talk and talk
and talk and talk about your profession,</i>

01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:02.930
<i>but you have to go out and do it.</i>

01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:04.930
<i>You know, there's no point
in just talking about it,</i>

01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:06.730
<i>and trying to convince people you're right.</i>

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:09.390
<i>You have to give them the example
and then talk about it.</i>

01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:14.970
And we feel we should have a voice
in running our industry, and I mean ours.

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:18.370
I don't mean mine, I mean ours.
'Cause football belongs to everybody.

01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:50.290
Were you strong in a
defensive wall, Martin?

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.290
I can imagine you in the wall
with your glasses on,

01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:56.410
sort of flinching a little bit, like benzema
did, or were you... did you stand strong?

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.630
Well, that's very nice of
you to say this, here.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:00.730
I actually didn't wear
glasses when I was...

01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:02.890
No, I did not...

01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:05.770
So, what you're seeing now
is an older gentleman.

01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:08.090
But, I did actually play
the game at one time.

01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:10.770
- Viera: Yes.
- Fabio wasn't terribly sure that I did...

01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:15.050
You know, I had to remind him
that despite the fact,

01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:17.050
that there's two world cup winners here,

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.990
actually when it comes to
the champions league...

01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:22.170
- Yeah.
- Used to be called the European cup,

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:23.290
I've won two of them.

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:26.150
I'd just like to know
how many you two have won?

01:41:27.305 --> 01:41:33.266
