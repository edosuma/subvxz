It'll go viral!
- Okay, okay.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.030
- Mm-hmm?
- So we get Cedric once,

16:28.074 --> 16:29.989
and then Cedric is furious.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.295
And if Cedric is furious,
then his publicist is furious,

16:32.339 --> 16:34.471
and then we're completely
blacklisted.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.038
You know why?
Because a publicist

16:36.082 --> 16:37.866
has a Rolodex
of other celebrities.

16:37.909 --> 16:41.348
That means no Louis C.K.,
no Drew Barrymore.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.351
That means no Taylor Swift,
and if you don't get TayTay,

16:44.394 --> 16:46.570
you never come back.
- Nothing without TayTay.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.050
- That's very true.
- TayTay.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.617
- TayTay.
- I didn't think about that.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.271
- I have an idea.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.751
What if there's a way
to get Cedric on the show...

16:53.795 --> 16:56.798
- Go on.
- But be honest with him,

16:56.841 --> 16:59.192
and he's happy about it?

16:59.235 --> 17:00.454
- That's impossible.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.499
- It's not.
I can do it.

This is "Nightcap."
