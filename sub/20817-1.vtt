01:31.922 --> 01:33.589
Raymond!

01:33.791 --> 01:35.290
Raymond!

01:40.664 --> 01:43.449
Ray? Sweetie?

01:44.001 --> 01:47.605
Ah, I play it loud.

01:47.705 --> 01:50.320
Like, I can't hear him.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.211
Pack your things,
you're going back to the hospital.

01:56.113 --> 02:00.183
I'm calling Daddy and he is taking you back.

03:48.992 --> 03:51.195
Mom said you have to hurry.

03:51.295 --> 03:54.932
- Hey.
- Is that the thing for the bank?

03:55.032 --> 03:57.768
Yeah. Yeah, that's a commission.

03:58.068 --> 04:01.538
Butterflies? So not metal.

04:01.638 --> 04:06.071
I know, I know, I agree.
But most people don't like metal.

04:07.511 --> 04:09.961
Most people's taste is in their...

04:11.699 --> 04:14.335
Have you not showered yet? We're late.

04:44.281 --> 04:47.695
Guys, can we listen to something
just a little bit less heavy?

04:48.585 --> 04:50.223
Metallica?

04:52.423 --> 04:55.273
I'm not sure
that's what your mom had in mind.

05:19.216 --> 05:21.969
Wow. It's gorgeous.

05:35.832 --> 05:38.235
Lived in Texas my whole life.

05:38.335 --> 05:41.836
It's always been hot but, well...

05:41.936 --> 05:44.618
...even Satan's praying for it to rain.

05:48.178 --> 05:52.549
As y'all can see, everything's true
to the turn of the century period.

05:52.649 --> 05:55.252
Yeah, I... I love this wallpaper.

05:55.752 --> 05:58.055
- Special, ain't it?
- Yeah.

05:58.155 --> 06:02.393
And through here, north facin',
double hung windows.

06:02.493 --> 06:05.096
Sunlight streamin' in.

06:05.396 --> 06:10.282
I'm not one for flowery words,
but tranquil comes to mind.

06:17.674 --> 06:21.759
Zo, this is twice the size of the room
that you have right now.

06:26.066 --> 06:30.001
Have fun, you're not gonna see any of them
with all the posters that you have.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.974
If there's even one teddy left...

06:37.394 --> 06:39.611
...you have to buy me some more.

06:43.233 --> 06:46.083
- Okay?
- Yeah. Of course.

07:06.523 --> 07:10.247
Could make a mighty fine bedroom
for a teenager down the track.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.197
When she's ready for some space of her own.

07:13.297 --> 07:15.632
This is gonna be Daddy's studio.

07:15.732 --> 07:18.769
Or a studio. Yes, indeed.

07:19.369 --> 07:24.004
Okay. By law I have to fess up
to any death in the house.

07:24.104 --> 07:26.590
And in this case there were two.

07:27.611 --> 07:29.423
Um, sweetie...

07:29.523 --> 07:33.768
...I had left my bag in the car
and it's got some documents I need.

07:35.018 --> 07:38.303
- If you want me to leave, just ask.
- Okay.

07:46.296 --> 07:49.747
And now you can't sell it
which is why the price is so low.

07:51.401 --> 07:55.606
Next showings at eleven,
got 'em lined up all day.

07:55.706 --> 07:57.709
Folks love a bargain.

07:58.609 --> 08:01.311
After all, what are we talkin' about here?

08:01.411 --> 08:05.832
A sweet little old lady who accidentally
fell down the stairs...

08:05.932 --> 08:09.620
...and her dear old hubby
who couldn't stand to live without her.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.490
Sad, indeed...

08:12.590 --> 08:16.040
...but it's not like
Charlie Manson lived here.

08:21.782 --> 08:23.998
Can you give us a minute, please?

08:24.901 --> 08:26.604
Thank you.

08:33.677 --> 08:36.724
- You don't find it creepy?
- What?

08:37.014 --> 08:38.582
- The couple?
- Yeah.

08:38.682 --> 08:40.206
No.

08:40.306 --> 08:43.397
No, I actually think it's really romantic.

08:43.986 --> 08:46.323
He loved her so much he couldn't
live another day without her.

08:46.423 --> 08:51.180
- You just want this studio.
- What? No.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.538
I'm not even thinkin' about this.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.203
- Can you hear that?
- What? What?

08:59.303 --> 09:01.605
- Wait.
- What do you mean, what?

09:01.705 --> 09:05.744
That right there. Astrid...

09:07.677 --> 09:09.747
Jesse...

09:10.747 --> 09:13.110
- You can't hear that?
- No, I can't hear that. What is it?

09:13.210 --> 09:15.319
Buy me.

09:15.419 --> 09:18.255
You don't hear that?
'Cause it's screaming at me.

09:18.355 --> 09:20.237
I can't ignore it.

10:17.681 --> 10:19.731
Can I help you?

11:08.799 --> 11:11.468
Zo's gonna have to change schools.

11:11.568 --> 11:13.879
She'll be alright, she's a brave kid.

11:16.306 --> 11:19.843
It's like two buses for me
to get to the salon.

11:19.943 --> 11:22.413
Not if we get a second car.

11:25.782 --> 11:30.137
You have to do more commissions. We just...
we cannot do this on my salary alone.

11:30.237 --> 11:32.739
I mean, rent is one thing
but this is a serious mortgage.

11:32.839 --> 11:36.133
I know, Astrid, why do you think I'm
painting fuckin' butterflies for a bank...

11:36.233 --> 11:38.695
...even though it makes me want to puke?

11:44.234 --> 11:47.370
Astrid, please, chill.

11:47.470 --> 11:49.897
Alright. Here.

11:50.941 --> 11:54.988
Please just... just take a hit. Okay?

12:11.962 --> 12:13.611
Exhale.

12:15.225 --> 12:16.945
Good.

12:19.536 --> 12:21.404
Close your eyes.

12:21.504 --> 12:23.387
Close your eyes.

12:24.908 --> 12:26.910
Repeat after me...

12:27.510 --> 12:29.980
...we just bought a house.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.483
- "We just bought a house."
- Yeah!

12:33.583 --> 12:36.453
And it's a beautiful fuckin' house.

12:36.553 --> 12:39.767
- "And it is a beautiful fucking house."
- Yeah.

12:41.424 --> 12:43.827
We're gonna be happy.

12:44.427 --> 12:46.763
"We're going to be happy."

12:46.863 --> 12:51.200
'Cause we never have to look
at that view ever again.

12:57.941 --> 12:59.824
Come here.

14:55.809 --> 14:58.078
County Sheriff's office, open up.

15:06.036 --> 15:08.504
Can you open up a little so I can see?

15:08.604 --> 15:10.187
Uh...

15:16.930 --> 15:18.965
You know why I'm here?

15:19.065 --> 15:21.115
I got a call about some loud music.

15:25.522 --> 15:27.357
What's your name?

15:29.659 --> 15:31.028
Ray.

15:31.928 --> 15:34.964
You gonna help us both out
and keep quiet, Ray?

15:38.485 --> 15:40.154
Yeah.

15:40.904 --> 15:42.753
Let me hear you say it.

15:44.074 --> 15:48.479
I'm gonna help us both out and keep quiet.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.879
Good. I don't want to have to come back.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.242
If I come back...

15:55.342 --> 15:57.788
...I got no choice but to give you
citation or ticket...

15:57.888 --> 15:59.903
...or worse, place you under arrest.

16:01.258 --> 16:03.276
I'd much rather not.

16:39.195 --> 16:41.444
It's never as bad as you think.

16:43.100 --> 16:48.538
Seriously, you just tough out the first
30 minutes and then the rest is gravy.

16:48.638 --> 16:50.707
I hate gravy.

16:54.243 --> 16:57.204
Alright, go forth, brave soldier.

17:08.058 --> 17:10.859
Don't let your schooling get in the way
of your education, alright?

17:10.960 --> 17:14.211
Yeah. I love you, Dad.

17:26.526 --> 17:28.376
Hey, Zo.

20:43.172 --> 20:45.467
Oh, my God.

20:48.143 --> 20:51.147
- Zooey.
- I haven't gotten you that good in ages.

20:51.247 --> 20:54.006
Yeah, that was hysterical.
That was super funny.

20:54.106 --> 20:55.952
Thank you.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.756
How was your first day?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.808
Sucked big time.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.361
Hey, hey.

21:09.865 --> 21:12.115
It'll get better, I promise.

21:14.270 --> 21:18.768
Okay, it just takes time.
Yeah, anything new, it just takes time.

21:46.252 --> 21:48.485
What happened to the butterflies?

21:49.805 --> 21:53.289
Jess? Jess?

21:53.976 --> 21:55.625
Jesse!

21:57.346 --> 21:59.430
Where were you?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.702
What?

22:03.002 --> 22:04.859
Where were you?

22:16.882 --> 22:18.733
I'll get it!

22:29.929 --> 22:31.577
Hi.

22:34.467 --> 22:37.684
There's someone here
and it's not the pizza man.

22:40.573 --> 22:41.991
Hi.

22:56.689 --> 22:59.191
I've got one just like that.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.194
A flying V.

23:01.294 --> 23:03.496
You got a red Flying V?

23:04.196 --> 23:07.333
I want a Gibson Flying V
like Kirk Hammett from Metallica uses.

23:07.433 --> 23:11.104
He is my favorite guitar hero. I asked
Mom and Dad to get one for my birthday...

23:11.204 --> 23:14.640
...but you know, Gibsons are really
expensive so I'm getting a little cheaper...

23:14.740 --> 23:16.156
Excuse me.

23:18.845 --> 23:21.026
- Can I help you?
- Mmm.

23:23.816 --> 23:26.218
I need to come home now.

23:27.854 --> 23:30.920
This is Mommy and Daddy's house.

23:31.724 --> 23:33.559
They're dead.

23:33.659 --> 23:36.510
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

23:40.299 --> 23:43.803
I'm really sorry about
what happened with your parents.

23:43.903 --> 23:46.172
But you don't live here anymore.

23:46.272 --> 23:49.075
Okay. It's time for you to leave.

23:49.675 --> 23:51.978
They won't let me play it loud.

23:52.078 --> 23:56.563
- I need to play it loud.
- You need to leave, now.

24:00.953 --> 24:04.588
- Dad.
- Jess... Jesse.

24:10.730 --> 24:13.814
You need to leave before I call the police.

24:16.936 --> 24:19.806
Alright, that's it, I'm calling the police.

24:20.606 --> 24:23.042
I'm callin' 'em right now.

24:39.025 --> 24:40.873
You were mean.

24:42.094 --> 24:45.378
You say, "treat everyone like
the way you want to be treated."

24:46.799 --> 24:48.682
You didn't do that.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.775
What?

24:55.875 --> 24:58.378
Well, the poor guy, obviously
has something wrong with him...

24:58.478 --> 25:01.895
...and his parents did just die in our house.

25:15.327 --> 25:17.063
<i>We've come to the place...</i>

25:17.163 --> 25:20.866
<i>...where we joke about the idea of the devil.</i>

25:20.966 --> 25:24.337
<i>With the horns, and the tail, and all that.</i>

25:24.737 --> 25:27.373
<i>But that is Satan's lie...</i>

25:27.473 --> 25:31.311
<i>...to distract us
from the reality of who He is.</i>

25:32.411 --> 25:35.328
<i>He is no mask in a Halloween store.</i>

25:36.782 --> 25:39.860
<i>He's not what you see in the movies.</i>

25:42.154 --> 25:47.808
<i>He is an active, violent,
anti-God personal reality.</i>

25:49.962 --> 25:55.267
<i>And as much as we refuse
to admit it, He lives through us.</i>

25:55.367 --> 25:59.973
<i>He uses us to carry out
His unspeakable deeds.</i>

26:01.073 --> 26:05.211
<i>For we are His pawns,
we are His demons on Earth...</i>

26:05.311 --> 26:07.778
<i>...we satiate His hunger.</i>

26:09.148 --> 26:13.019
<i>If you have the slightest bit
of greed, in your heart...</i>

26:13.119 --> 26:16.456
<i>...He will turn it into an avalanche.</i>

26:16.556 --> 26:19.506
<i>He will slither into your soul.</i>

26:55.928 --> 26:59.032
That's really great, Zooey, that's not
gonna win you any Academy Awards.

26:59.132 --> 27:02.802
You're not supposed to go if you're sick
because everyone else gets sick too.

27:02.902 --> 27:05.551
Well, it looks like we got
an outbreak on our hands.

27:08.407 --> 27:11.076
Oh, my God. Dad.

27:11.176 --> 27:14.413
I said I wanted a Flying V
and he's given me his.

27:14.513 --> 27:17.179
And a Marshall, Dad,
he's given me his Marshall...

27:20.302 --> 27:21.885
Dad.

27:22.688 --> 27:24.594
I can keep 'em, right?

27:25.024 --> 27:28.461
Please. Please.

27:28.961 --> 27:32.579
No. I can't let you keep this guitar.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.176
Hey. Hey.

27:39.839 --> 27:43.655
I'm gettin' you a guitar and an amp
for your birthday. Come on.

27:46.145 --> 27:48.795
Not a Flying V, and a Marshall.

28:05.131 --> 28:08.120
I know that Leonard
already rejected my portfolio.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.803
- But I just need...
- Leonard doesn't look at artists twice, Jesse.

28:10.903 --> 28:14.173
Yes, I know, but please.

28:14.573 --> 28:16.542
This is different.

28:16.642 --> 28:19.422
I've never had a muse before.

28:19.812 --> 28:22.258
I don't remember painting this.

28:22.548 --> 28:25.299
It's like it's... it's like somethin'...

28:29.054 --> 28:30.971
It flowed through me.

28:56.966 --> 28:59.032
I'll see what I can do.

31:34.606 --> 31:35.989
Rocky?

31:37.143 --> 31:38.541
Here, boy.

31:43.682 --> 31:45.698
Come on, Rocky.

31:47.286 --> 31:49.335
Just gonna go get Rocky.

31:51.156 --> 31:52.838
Rocky.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.940
Here, boy.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.151
What the fuck?

32:50.816 --> 32:52.699
I'm so sorry.

32:54.887 --> 32:56.489
Hey.

32:57.339 --> 32:58.905
Zo.

33:05.097 --> 33:06.946
Okay, you know what?

33:10.035 --> 33:14.053
I deserve that. Okay, totally deserve that.

33:20.045 --> 33:22.495
I'm really sorry, Zo.

33:24.366 --> 33:26.635
It's only my second day.

33:26.735 --> 33:30.436
I don't know anyone.
And you just left me here.

33:33.525 --> 33:35.395
I was painting.

33:36.095 --> 33:40.333
I thought that I was in there
for five minutes.

33:40.933 --> 33:45.184
And I stepped outside and the sun
had gone down and I panicked.

33:46.605 --> 33:49.008
I didn't think that
I was in there for so long.

33:49.108 --> 33:52.192
I just... I completely got lost in it.

34:00.786 --> 34:03.155
- Don't do it again.
- I won't.

34:03.355 --> 34:04.857
- Swear.
- I swear.

34:04.957 --> 34:06.673
On my grave.

34:07.726 --> 34:09.208
I swear.

34:10.896 --> 34:13.746
Can we please be friends again? Please?

34:23.876 --> 34:27.326
Are you gonna let me keep the guitar and amp?

34:29.715 --> 34:33.498
Hello, Austin, it's been a while,
but are you ready to get heavy?

34:36.989 --> 34:40.474
I said, are you ready to get heavy?

34:47.833 --> 34:50.777
Scissor kick off the Marshall stack.

34:52.004 --> 34:53.819
Thank you, everyone.

35:16.024 --> 35:19.898
<i>Throughout the ages,
in all the various religions of man...</i>

35:19.998 --> 35:22.434
<i>...there is one constant.</i>

35:22.534 --> 35:25.952
<i>The personality of the being we call Satan.</i>

35:29.308 --> 35:31.924
<i>In Samaria, He was Baal.</i>

35:34.513 --> 35:37.062
<i>In Egypt, Set.</i>

35:40.018 --> 35:42.635
<i>In Persia, Orin.</i>

35:45.541 --> 35:50.426
<i>In China, He was chief
of the warlock, called Wu.</i>

35:51.363 --> 35:54.399
<i>There is always the dark God.</i>

35:54.499 --> 35:56.235
<i>The fallen God.</i>

35:56.335 --> 35:58.384
<i>There's always Satan.</i>

36:47.719 --> 36:50.501
Did you tell her that she
could keep the guitar because...

36:50.601 --> 36:53.305
...you know, I thought
that you said that you...

36:56.278 --> 36:58.094
Oh, my God.

36:59.731 --> 37:01.580
Is that...

37:06.071 --> 37:08.287
I didn't mean to do this.

37:10.309 --> 37:11.944
Okay, what's going on?

37:15.314 --> 37:19.398
This... this is our daughter on fire.

37:20.419 --> 37:22.997
- She can never see this.
- Okay, well, then destroy it.

37:23.097 --> 37:24.890
I can't.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.539
Why?

37:27.693 --> 37:29.929
Because it isn't finished yet.

37:30.629 --> 37:35.400
- No, it is, if you want it to be.
- No. No, it's not that simple, Astrid.

37:35.500 --> 37:39.067
It's like these children are inside of me.

37:39.888 --> 37:44.586
Begging, screaming to be let out.

37:46.578 --> 37:48.674
And I don't know why.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.141
Come on.

42:32.497 --> 42:34.993
He wanted it to be you.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.729
I wouldn't let Him.

42:38.453 --> 42:41.402
'Cause you're a special one.

42:50.015 --> 42:53.018
No. No, no, no. You can't be loud.

42:53.118 --> 42:56.555
He'll make me do that thing I don't wanna
do and I don't wanna do that to you.

42:56.655 --> 43:01.419
Please, please, please. Please, be quiet.

43:04.996 --> 43:09.093
If I take my hand away,
are you gonna be loud?

43:09.501 --> 43:11.169
- No.
- Mm-mm.

43:11.269 --> 43:12.737
Cross your heart?

43:12.837 --> 43:14.239
- And hope to die?
- Mm-hmm.

43:14.339 --> 43:15.941
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

43:16.041 --> 43:17.735
Okay.

43:20.978 --> 43:22.635
Help!

43:30.121 --> 43:32.361
Don't! Don't!

43:34.560 --> 43:36.194
No!

43:43.401 --> 43:45.228
Get out!

43:45.328 --> 43:48.366
Get out! Get out!

44:36.171 --> 44:38.232
Were the doors locked?

44:39.224 --> 44:42.397
Uh, yes, they were but, um...

44:42.497 --> 44:45.790
- Jess went out to the studio...
- I'm so sorry.

44:46.564 --> 44:48.593
It's not your fault.

44:50.752 --> 44:52.647
It's his fault.

44:53.939 --> 44:56.908
Now you mentioned that
he'd lived here before you all?

44:57.008 --> 44:58.703
Mm-hmm.

44:59.210 --> 45:02.614
- Still the same locks?
- Yeah.

45:02.714 --> 45:04.849
Then there's every chance
that he has a key...

45:04.949 --> 45:07.185
...which means you need to change them locks.

45:07.285 --> 45:08.980
Okay.

45:10.071 --> 45:14.746
And I think it's best if you folks move
into a motel. Even just for a few days.

45:15.026 --> 45:18.933
Give us some time to run the prints
and take a real good look into this guy.

45:19.798 --> 45:24.576
I'll be stationed outside all night
until you're up and out in the morning.

45:24.676 --> 45:26.514
So don't you worry.

45:26.614 --> 45:28.666
You're gonna be alright.

45:37.515 --> 45:41.486
Try and get some sleep, okay.
It's gonna make you feel a lot better.

45:41.586 --> 45:43.834
What if he comes back?

45:45.557 --> 45:48.745
Well, that's why the police lady is outside.

45:51.429 --> 45:53.725
What if he gets past her?

46:52.623 --> 46:54.684
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

46:54.784 --> 46:57.996
Astrid. I'm so sorry.
I thought that you were...

46:58.096 --> 47:00.758
I'm okay. I'm okay.

47:02.447 --> 47:04.328
I'm ready for school.

47:06.871 --> 47:08.873
- No...
- Sweetie...

47:08.973 --> 47:12.036
Sweetie, you don't have
to go to school today.

47:13.011 --> 47:14.976
It's safer than here.

47:47.779 --> 47:50.274
If he comes back, I'll smash him.

47:53.751 --> 47:55.580
I'm gonna be late.

47:56.604 --> 47:58.052
Bye.

48:27.228 --> 48:29.297
Oh, fuck.

48:33.091 --> 48:35.520
- Hey.
- <i>Jesse.</i>

48:36.828 --> 48:39.297
- Yeah.
- <i>It's Mara.</i>

48:39.397 --> 48:41.833
I showed Leonard your painting.

48:42.433 --> 48:44.262
He approves.

48:47.372 --> 48:50.925
- That's, uh, that's...
- <i>He'd like to come by your studio.</i>

48:51.025 --> 48:53.978
- <i>See what you're working on.</i>
- Yeah, yeah. No, definitely.

48:54.078 --> 48:58.576
- That's great, any time.
- <i>Leonard's got an opening at three.</i>

49:00.251 --> 49:02.954
- Wait, today?
- <i>Yes.</i>

49:03.054 --> 49:07.118
No, I can't.
I have to pick my daughter up at three.

49:14.499 --> 49:16.727
I can push it back to two.

49:17.385 --> 49:19.447
But that's all I can do.

49:20.205 --> 49:22.233
<i>Take it or leave it, Jesse.</i>

49:31.232 --> 49:33.060
Come on.

50:25.403 --> 50:28.466
What this is, Jesse, is a show of faith.

50:30.374 --> 50:33.037
But I'm willing to take that chance.

50:33.911 --> 50:36.341
Because your latest work is...

50:38.566 --> 50:40.590
...wonderfully disturbing.

50:43.154 --> 50:45.092
Fuckin' painting nearly killed me.

50:45.192 --> 50:47.879
<i>Le sang de la terre.</i>

50:50.061 --> 50:53.290
- I'm sorry.
- The blood of the Earth.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.370
The world's oldest unblended cognac.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.382
That's what we've been sharing.

51:01.839 --> 51:04.101
Beside the moment of course.

51:12.150 --> 51:15.340
Now that you're being represented by Belial.

51:15.440 --> 51:18.756
It's time for you to start
getting used to nice things.

51:18.856 --> 51:20.884
Uh, Leonard...

51:22.260 --> 51:25.304
...I'd love to sit here and drink
this whole bottle with you right now...

51:25.404 --> 51:28.399
...really, I would,
but I gotta pick my daughter up.

51:28.499 --> 51:31.936
I'm sure your daughter won't mind
if you're one or two minutes late.

51:32.036 --> 51:34.105
I'm already pushing it.

51:34.305 --> 51:36.814
What's a few minutes in the grander scheme?

51:37.942 --> 51:40.212
Actually, it's everything.

51:40.812 --> 51:43.644
I'm not gonna get into it
right now, just trust me.

51:43.744 --> 51:45.593
I can't be late.

51:47.822 --> 51:49.699
Well, as they say...

51:50.099 --> 51:53.751
"nothing of true worth comes without some...

51:55.493 --> 51:57.034
...sacrifice."

52:03.127 --> 52:05.103
To sacrifice.

52:47.712 --> 52:49.573
Oh, no.

53:04.168 --> 53:06.041
Come on!

53:17.942 --> 53:19.787
Come on.

53:50.841 --> 53:52.470
Zooey!

55:36.747 --> 55:38.575
He's right.

55:40.084 --> 55:42.900
You are the sweetest candy of them all.

55:44.054 --> 55:47.308
I have to do that thing I don't wanna do now.

55:48.693 --> 55:51.562
Please. Please.

55:51.662 --> 55:55.266
Let me go, please!

55:55.366 --> 55:56.995
Please!

59:11.562 --> 59:13.205
You...

59:14.405 --> 59:17.392
...swore on my grave.

59:33.417 --> 59:35.292
Look, um...

59:36.089 --> 59:39.174
I know it doesn't seem
like it right now but...

59:39.274 --> 59:41.518
...she's actually very lucky.

59:43.561 --> 59:47.731
When he was twelve, he did
the same thing to a 9-year-old girl.

59:47.831 --> 59:51.328
Hit her over the head with a rock
and then he tried to bury her.

59:52.106 --> 59:56.590
Case went to juvenile court and he
ended up in state psychiatric for 20 years.

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:02.034
Does it say in there...

01:00:02.784 --> 01:00:04.377
...why he did it?

01:00:11.955 --> 01:00:13.984
"I have to feed Him children.

01:00:15.225 --> 01:00:17.888
Because children are His candy."

01:00:19.163 --> 01:00:22.593
He goes on to clarify who "He" is...

01:00:24.034 --> 01:00:26.530
...none other than Satan himself.

01:00:35.896 --> 01:00:37.791
Thanks for your patience.

01:00:38.632 --> 01:00:40.437
How's she doin'?

01:00:42.486 --> 01:00:44.522
Like I was tellin' Jesse here.

01:00:44.622 --> 01:00:49.920
I think the best course of action
is to put you into witness protection.

01:00:51.128 --> 01:00:53.264
And how long does witness protection last?

01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:55.826
As long as it takes to find him.

01:01:05.743 --> 01:01:07.271
Just the gas?

01:01:24.094 --> 01:01:26.497
- Need a hand with that?
- Nope. I got it.

01:01:26.597 --> 01:01:28.632
- You sure?
- Yep.

01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:30.363
Okay.

01:01:30.663 --> 01:01:32.207
Alright.

01:01:36.173 --> 01:01:38.990
Thank you. Your key, officer.

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.504
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:43.544 --> 01:01:46.750
- I really feel bad for that little girl.
- Yeah.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:49.741
It's gonna be a long time
before she sleeps through the night.

01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:46.704
- Where is he? He was just here.
- Dad?

01:02:57.788 --> 01:03:00.857
No! No.

01:03:00.957 --> 01:03:03.560
Zo. I'll be right back.

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.437
Zooey! Zooey!

01:04:29.679 --> 01:04:32.309
He's right outside of our door!

01:04:40.824 --> 01:04:43.887
- Run!
- Zooey, come on!

01:06:19.723 --> 01:06:23.193
No. No. No.

01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:25.222
No!

01:06:25.495 --> 01:06:27.164
No!

01:06:27.514 --> 01:06:29.616
Mom! Daddy!

01:06:29.716 --> 01:06:33.204
No! No! No! No!

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:35.940
No!

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.069
No!

01:07:04.408 --> 01:07:05.902
Jesse.

01:07:06.002 --> 01:07:07.828
Jess...

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:16.141
No. Zooey, Zooey.

01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:26.923
Please, don't hurt her.
Please, don't hurt her, please.

01:07:27.023 --> 01:07:29.052
No, stop!

01:07:31.228 --> 01:07:32.866
Zooey, don't.

01:08:04.494 --> 01:08:06.730
- No! No!
- No, no. No!

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.658
No!

01:08:21.278 --> 01:08:23.139
Mom!

01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:28.944
No, no! No!

01:08:31.421 --> 01:08:34.446
Please, please, please.

01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:39.729
Please.

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:41.932
Jesse.

01:08:42.032 --> 01:08:45.234
Jesse, you have to wake up, he's got her.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:49.277
Jesse.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.671
Jesse!

01:09:02.535 --> 01:09:04.504
Where is she?

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:07.390
No! No!

01:09:08.692 --> 01:09:11.895
No! No, no, no!

01:09:11.995 --> 01:09:14.531
No, no, no!

01:09:16.733 --> 01:09:20.161
Look, look, look! Look.

01:09:21.371 --> 01:09:23.173
It's Him.

01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:48.563
Hang on, Zooey!

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:53.743
No, no, no!

01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:17.612
Daddy!

01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:34.504
Daddy!

01:10:43.303 --> 01:10:45.439
No, no.

01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:41.511
Zo... Zooey. Zooey, you need to come to me.

01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:44.180
- Just jump really fast.
- I can't!

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.283
Please trust me.

01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:49.319
I'm gonna catch you, Zo.

01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:09.138
Are you okay?

01:12:21.114 --> 01:12:22.864
Zooey.

01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.566
Where are you going?

01:13:17.073 --> 01:13:21.511
I can feel them inside me...

01:13:21.611 --> 01:13:25.626
...begging, screaming to be let out.

01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:28.881
<i>And I don't know why.</i>
