01:51.077 --> 01:53.068
I told you, you didn't have to come.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.806
Yeah, let you drive yourself
when you look this bad?

02:01.254 --> 02:02.278
Yeah?

02:02.355 --> 02:03.652
He's out.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.147
He looks good.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.526
<i>- Talk to him. Get a sense.
- Okay.</i>

02:27.180 --> 02:29.614
Your cousin's out of rehab. Looks good.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.644
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.785
Lyme titers, sed rate...

02:40.793 --> 02:41.885
inconclusive.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.155
Score one for the Italians.

02:44.297 --> 02:47.266
- You don't have lupus.
- Thank God for that.

02:52.372 --> 02:55.102
Think we might be looking
at a viral syndrome...

02:55.275 --> 02:56.970
maybe mono.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.343
- Oh, God.
- How's your emotional level?

03:00.580 --> 03:02.980
Stress off the charts lately? Like all of us?

03:03.049 --> 03:06.109
- What do you mean?
- Death, major change of any kind?

03:07.387 --> 03:10.049
No, just the usual.
One day runs into the next.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.755
Stay on the Advil.
Your temperature goes up, you call me.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.460
You know, it's amazing.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.328
I got a relative who's got a heroin problem.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.794
The people that need drugs,
all they can get is shit like Advil.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.469
Thank you for coming.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.310
That was Grove Street.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.815
I gotta make a stop down in Sea Bright.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.819
- I don't feel well.
- You get some sea air.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.515
- We'll go to Barr's. You won't have to cook.
- Goddamn it.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.717
Yeah, I really want lobster.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.520
The student loan people called.

03:48.595 --> 03:51.086
We're late
with Allegra's nursing school payment.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.295
- Where you going?
- Nordstrom's. They're having a sale.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.673
Sallie Mae calls, and your response to that
is to go shopping?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.868
It's a sale, John. I need clothes for Italy.

04:05.511 --> 04:09.140
- We're still going, aren't we?
- Might be time for a little belt-tightening.

04:09.215 --> 04:12.514
The bottom line is I'll be losing money
if the Esplanade is shut down.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.782
We should try to go.
I spoke to Nicole Lupertazzi.

04:15.855 --> 04:19.916
When she and Little Carmine stayed
at the Hassler last year, he loved it.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.720
That's good for Little Carmine, then.

04:22.795 --> 04:26.697
His fucking wallet isn't tied
to the goddamned Esplanade, god damn it!

04:30.003 --> 04:32.335
John, why are you yelling at me?

04:33.740 --> 04:35.401
John, what'd I do?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.819
Is that my father's truck?

04:56.696 --> 04:58.391
What the hell's going on?

04:58.464 --> 05:00.591
Me to know, you to find out.

05:05.171 --> 05:08.299
So, what do you think, Mel?
Don't see no dry rot.

05:08.374 --> 05:11.741
Mrs. Soprano, Virginia Lupo,
RElMAX Community Realty.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.867
Hi.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.780
That's right. It's even got a name.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.652
- Where did this come from?
- That's if we can get it.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.914
This is a huge amount of money.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.025
And your construction project shut down...

05:28.094 --> 05:31.120
That can't last forever. It's for the family.

05:32.598 --> 05:36.125
As the kids get older,
it gets harder to keep us all together...

05:36.536 --> 05:38.003
but this is a draw.

05:38.771 --> 05:41.865
Bring friends down,
have big cookouts, jet ski.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.743
And for us, too, though.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.578
When we were piss poor...

05:47.647 --> 05:50.844
this was the biggest caviar wish
we could come up with.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.019
Kind of reminds you
of the Kennedy compound, don't it?

06:06.466 --> 06:09.867
Can I ask you why they're selling?
My husband said, "If we can get it. "

06:09.936 --> 06:12.268
Well, there is a buyer already.

06:12.972 --> 06:14.769
In fact, the house is sold.

06:15.108 --> 06:19.340
But there's a chance that these buyers
won't qualify for financing.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.778
And I know the owner, Alan.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.915
He lives just next door, here.
He's an attorney.

06:25.051 --> 06:29.511
If you're offering cash,
I thought you should at least see the place.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.484
So, it's not really for sale.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.517
It's just as well,
because we couldn't swing this.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.187
There's Al!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.108
The jury has claimed they are deadlocked.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.270
However, I'm inclined to agree
with prosecution.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.511
I'm going to give them additional time
to reach a verdict.

06:57.984 --> 07:01.010
We should've had a hung jury mistrial.
Object, for Christ's sake!

07:01.087 --> 07:03.783
Allen charge. It has to play out.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.456
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've communicated that you feel...

07:13.533 --> 07:16.696
that you're unable to come
to a unanimous verdict in this case.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.728
Now, I know that you've been at it
for a while, and it can be frustrating.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.906
But we've all spent a lot of time on this trial.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.412
And being as I have no reason to believe
that another jury...

07:28.481 --> 07:31.882
with the same evidence
would be better able to reach a verdict...

07:31.951 --> 07:36.081
I'm going to ask you to go back in there
and reason with each other...

07:36.289 --> 07:38.257
and apply the law...

07:38.324 --> 07:40.815
and come back in here with a verdict.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.023
If not, I wanna move on.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.223
Here.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.066
Did somebody check the order,
make sure we got everything this time?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.128
Yes.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.600
Well, keep me posted.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.512
Dinner's served!

08:08.788 --> 08:11.256
- Get any sleep?
- Couldn't.

08:13.593 --> 08:17.586
We have absolutely no business
getting into something like that house...

08:17.663 --> 08:19.858
with A.J. Two years away from college.

08:19.932 --> 08:23.231
That was Virginia Lupo on the phone.
She hasn't heard from the owner.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.566
I guess that deal's gonna go through.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.230
I wonder who they are.

08:29.475 --> 08:32.501
Motherfucking, goddamn orange-peel beef!

08:32.912 --> 08:34.379
Call them up.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.539
You got me plain soup, right?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.140
We'll be finished eating the rest
before he gets back.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.652
Go through the order while they're still here.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.122
What good does that do?
He's still gotta get it and come back again.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.955
- What happened?
- They left out part of the order.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.052
- Call them up.
- Sit down and eat.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.694
I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.432
What are we talking about?

08:59.505 --> 09:02.474
I was thinking of buying your mother
a house down on the shore.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.339
Un-fucking-believable!

09:05.044 --> 09:07.979
- Would we have a gym?
- It's the shore.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.171
Wouldn't you want to be outdoors?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.774
Forget that. You're fined $3 for the F-word.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.821
I heard Dad say "mother-F"
when I was coming down the stairs.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.755
He's fined, too.
We're gonna make this policy work.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.554
It's too late.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.734
What's going on?

09:40.613 --> 09:43.980
You know, it does seem like a good value,
even at that price.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.542
Waterfront property, in that area.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.215
We probably wouldn't get hurt,
as an investment.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.621
You're the one that took real estate classes.

09:57.029 --> 10:00.965
Didn't you say that a person shouldn't look
at a house as an investment?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.860
I know you.
If you don't get the place, you'll sulk.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.666
- And I'll be the wet blanket.
- I'll sulk?

10:06.839 --> 10:08.363
I was sleeping.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.077
If you want me to sign off...

10:16.949 --> 10:19.281
We probably wouldn't lose money.

10:23.089 --> 10:26.991
But if you don't want to go through with it,
believe me, that's fine, too.

10:40.573 --> 10:44.441
But if you did, Virginia Lupo's
phone number is on the bureau.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.138
And, you know...

10:47.146 --> 10:49.740
better to act quickly if, you know...

10:51.217 --> 10:55.347
More is lost by indecision than
by wrong decision, that's all I'm saying.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.388
Hey, Jack Lemmon.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.155
How's Lee Remick?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.826
So, how the fuck are you?

11:07.199 --> 11:09.463
- That place help you?
- Yeah.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.101
I found out about strengths I have
I didn't even know I had.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.467
- You look fucking great.
- Thank you.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.168
Thank everybody
for forcing me to deal with it.

11:19.478 --> 11:22.538
- Especially Adriana.
- You're not shooting junk, right?

11:23.783 --> 11:26.581
Fuck, no. I'm completely clean and sober.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.546
Which one of the 12 steps you on now?

11:29.622 --> 11:33.581
The only one I haven't done is go around
to all the people I fucked over...

11:33.659 --> 11:35.684
while I was using, and apologize.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.426
Maybe you shouldn't do that one.

11:42.568 --> 11:46.095
- You know, let sleeping dogs lie.
- That's what I was thinking.

11:46.338 --> 11:50.604
Maybe in a couple of cases,
I'll send flowers, or cash in some cases.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.551
- Where's Carmine at?
- No change whatsoever.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.023
Where are you at?

12:06.826 --> 12:10.318
I think a movement from below
is not palatable to the other bosses.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.387
It's what they fear most.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.193
A movement from outside,
it's more forgivable...

12:15.401 --> 12:18.199
and more understandable,
given the facts, here.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.569
I mean, you've been reasonable.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.475
If I do it, what do you do for me?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.147
I take a sad song and make it better...

12:30.216 --> 12:32.844
with the other families, as regards you.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.046
You're smart to have reservations...

12:36.188 --> 12:39.055
but there's differences
between this and Castellano.

12:39.859 --> 12:43.192
Yes, you still got the four other families
who could raise a stink...

12:43.262 --> 12:45.924
but Andy's my brother-in-law.
I have their ear.

12:50.669 --> 12:51.897
I'm gonna pass.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.439
- Fuck are you talking about?
- I'm taking the risk.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.998
Fuck what were you talking
about last time then?

12:57.076 --> 12:58.304
What would it take?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.575
Fuck even one percentage point.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.919
All claims to my HUD business are irrigated.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.347
All right.

13:10.990 --> 13:15.188
All future construction projects,
60-40 in my favor.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.333
What I'm gonna tell you
is for your ears only, and Sil's.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.777
We're gonna take out Carmine Lupertazzi.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.618
Johnny Sack's gonna go to war.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.588
No, he's not.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.584
That's right.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.153
See, Carmine's got major income
besides construction, Johnny don't.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.325
Only other person hurting worse
than either of the pricks is me.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.029
Whacking the boss
of one of the five families?

13:59.138 --> 14:02.335
- Johnny's a snaky fuck.
- That's something to be considered.

14:02.408 --> 14:06.310
But remember, also, how deeply hurt
fucking Johnny felt over Carmine...

14:06.679 --> 14:08.943
not backing him
on those slurs against Ginny.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.174
Life's funny.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.683
Carmine never made that right with John.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.147
I knew back then that was a mistake.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.512
Gonna hit Carmine soon?

14:18.591 --> 14:21.822
If I'm gonna buy this house,
I need the Esplanade scratch.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.498
It shouldn't look like what it is.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.967
Home invasion, carjacking,
fucking ingrown toenail...

14:32.872 --> 14:35.033
I know these black guys from Irvington.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.972
That's the right idea.

14:37.276 --> 14:40.541
It can never get out
who whacked the old fuck.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.175
- Are they trustworthy, these guys?
- Yeah.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.782
Make sure.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.661
Help you?

15:02.534 --> 15:04.695
Hi, how you doing? I'm Tony Soprano.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.933
I was here with my wife the other day
with Virginia Lupo.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.767
- Right. Alan Sapinsly.
- How are you?

15:13.212 --> 15:14.304
So, what do you think?

15:14.380 --> 15:17.406
She says those other people
are gonna go through with it.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.112
I was gonna go talk to you, frankly,
after I took another look at the place.

15:21.186 --> 15:25.247
This is galling because I don't think
they're going to qualify for financing...

15:25.324 --> 15:28.782
and we gave them this God-awful
90-day escrow. My wife's doing.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.452
She liked Mrs. Kim.

15:31.363 --> 15:34.696
I can do 15 days. Shortest allowable by law.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.902
Never tire of painting this.

15:45.377 --> 15:47.902
- You'd be coming in with cash, right?
- Yeah.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.080
Fuck this.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.082
Dr. Kim, hey, Alan Sapinsly.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.086
It's not?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.455
Well, we've got serious problems.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.891
On the house. Sure.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.792
He's going into surgery,
doesn't want to talk there in the prep room.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.198
Yes, I'm here.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.371
What does your lender say?

16:15.341 --> 16:16.638
Jesus, Doctor.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.576
I take almost no comfort from those words.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.908
And were I you, I wouldn't either.

16:22.047 --> 16:25.915
I'm aware we have a contract in place.
Doctor, please, I'm an attorney.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.283
Look, Cho-Sun. Wait, you're not listening.

16:28.354 --> 16:32.051
Simply stated, I want the chance to sell
to a more qualified buyer...

16:32.391 --> 16:34.916
if I can find one at this late date.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.152
Actually, it's very...

16:37.796 --> 16:41.163
Wait, do you want to do all the talking
and I'll just stand here?

16:41.233 --> 16:42.325
Thank you.

16:42.468 --> 16:46.268
You call Virginia Lupo, she calls the bank,
you get your deposit back.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.840
Your wife's a grown woman, she'll adjust.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.644
Dr. Kim, I spent 10 years as a litigator.

16:53.712 --> 16:58.376
Buy this property, I'll make your life
a misery. I can tort you into the poorhouse.

16:58.650 --> 17:02.643
I've got an overseas call.
Think it over. You have Virginia's number.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.419
Who knows? We'll see.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.188
I wouldn't want to be the patient
he's gonna operate on.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.023
Let's hold a good thought?

17:22.674 --> 17:23.663
Hello.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.711
Virginia, sure, hi.

17:28.781 --> 17:29.975
We did?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.124
All right.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.991
Picture the fishing off that dock.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.735
God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?

17:54.306 --> 17:56.331
First time I felt good signing papers.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.035
Dad, blue crabs!

17:59.211 --> 18:01.372
Oh, my God, this is nice.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.086
You'll inherit this.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.851
Dad, what a thing to say.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.369
Anthony Soprano...

18:33.612 --> 18:35.637
you are full of surprises.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.982
It's good to see a smile on your face.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.964
Praise the Lord for sobriety.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.698
The higher power.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.299
- That 12-step shit doing for you?
- Yeah.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.071
Thanks for asking.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.805
We sold you "H" when that was your thing.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.313
Still we here
when it's wop-whacking time in Brooklyn.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.547
- It should look like a carjacking.
- See?

19:11.717 --> 19:15.153
That's why you came to us.
That's some stereotyping shit.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.745
He goes mall-walking inside King's Plaza.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.656
7:00 a. m. Tuesdays and Thursdays. Regular.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.894
Macy's entrance, Avenue U and Flatbush.

19:24.062 --> 19:25.825
You get the down payment?

19:36.642 --> 19:38.132
Next sound you hear...

19:52.925 --> 19:55.393
Home of the burger, what's your beef?

19:56.595 --> 19:59.564
<i>l'm sorry. l have wrong number.</i>

19:59.798 --> 20:02.096
This is the Soprano residence.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.560
Tony?

20:03.902 --> 20:05.631
<i>No, this is Anthony.</i>

20:06.605 --> 20:09.267
Yes. The handsome boy.

20:10.475 --> 20:11.635
Who is this?

20:13.011 --> 20:14.535
Is your mother there?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.570
Ma, telephone!

20:16.882 --> 20:18.782
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.249
Is this Mrs. Soprano?

20:27.693 --> 20:29.058
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

20:31.163 --> 20:33.063
I used to fuck your husband.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.644
A.J., I've got it!

20:59.291 --> 21:00.815
Tony loves me, you know.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.588
<i>lf it wasn't for his kids,
you'd be out on the street.</i>

21:03.662 --> 21:04.788
What do you want?

21:04.863 --> 21:08.355
I thought you might want to know
we have some sadness in common.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.062
He has been sleeping
with my cousin, Svetlana.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.237
<i>That's right.</i>

21:14.306 --> 21:16.740
<i>While she was taking care of his uncle.</i>

21:20.045 --> 21:21.444
You piece of shit.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.311
Yes, I'm a piece of shit.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.251
I'm a piece of shit which the world,
every morning, strains...

21:28.320 --> 21:29.981
and pushes out of its butt!

21:31.356 --> 21:35.190
If you can,
imagine where you are on the pecking order.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.626
You call my house again...

21:40.899 --> 21:43.094
you ever speak...

21:43.468 --> 21:47.302
to one of my children again,
I will track you down, and I will kill you.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.964
We have got guns here.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.700
<i>l mean it.</i>

21:51.043 --> 21:52.670
You remember my cousin?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.912
She was also his mama's caregiver,
with the one leg.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.745
<i>lt is so absurd, why would l make it up?</i>

22:33.985 --> 22:35.247
What the fuck?

22:45.464 --> 22:48.331
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You fucking shitbag!

22:49.334 --> 22:52.201
Don't come up here!
Get the fuck out of this house!

23:07.853 --> 23:09.445
What's the matter?

23:11.957 --> 23:13.925
Carm, what did I do now?

23:19.631 --> 23:20.620
What did I do?

23:24.669 --> 23:27.968
Your mother told you what I said
to your father about her psoriasis?

23:28.039 --> 23:30.439
I was just trying to be honest with him.

23:33.378 --> 23:37.439
You have made a fool of me for years
with these whores.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.942
Now it's come into our home?

23:40.318 --> 23:43.082
- What are you talking about?
- The Russian called.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.418
Your son answered the telephone.

23:46.324 --> 23:47.655
Oh, Jesus.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.428
She's insane. She's fucking certifiable.

23:51.496 --> 23:54.465
I told you, you can't believe
nothing she says, whatever it is.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.728
We haven't seen each other like that.

23:56.802 --> 23:59.134
I swear to Christ. I told you!

23:59.304 --> 24:01.499
- What about her cousin?
- What?

24:02.741 --> 24:03.765
No.

24:03.842 --> 24:06.902
The nurse who took care of your mother,
who I liked?

24:08.013 --> 24:11.176
Who I talked to on the telephone
about your mother's alopecia...

24:11.249 --> 24:12.807
and her bowel movements?

24:12.884 --> 24:15.079
Who you told me came from an agency?

24:15.187 --> 24:18.452
Who I shared vodka with
the night your mother died?

24:19.157 --> 24:20.852
You've been fucking her?

24:20.926 --> 24:23.087
There is not a shred of truth in that.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.721
Why'd the cousin make it up?
Because she's jealous!

24:25.797 --> 24:27.162
Why you, fuck...

24:29.067 --> 24:30.557
Let go of me!

24:52.791 --> 24:54.258
Just get out, Tony.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.492
Don't even say anything.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.028
I'm not going anywhere, and you know it.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.625
So, let's just lie down, we'll calm down...

25:02.701 --> 25:04.430
Get your hands off of me!

25:06.238 --> 25:08.468
Don't you touch me ever again.

25:11.209 --> 25:12.437
Where's A.J.?

25:13.411 --> 25:16.574
So, you've had a one-legged one now?
That's nice.

25:17.616 --> 25:20.141
You've had quite a time on my watch.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.054
The pre-school assistant...

25:24.723 --> 25:27.886
- the weightlifter...
- At least I never stole from you.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.790
Who stole, Tony? Who, me?

25:29.861 --> 25:32.796
My own wife, $40,000. From the birdfeeder.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.459
The birdfeeder.
Listen to yourself, you sound demented.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.471
What, you want to hit me, Tony? Go ahead.

25:42.641 --> 25:46.407
Just go away, please,
I can't stand it anymore.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.973
- I didn't do it.
- I found her fingernail, Tony!

25:53.051 --> 25:55.451
You saw it that day, on your night table.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.822
I found it, and I put it there.
I know you saw it.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.118
That...

26:01.927 --> 26:03.292
What? That what?

26:05.430 --> 26:06.419
Nothing.

26:19.811 --> 26:20.800
What?

26:21.947 --> 26:24.313
You know what I don't understand, Tony?

26:26.851 --> 26:29.115
What does she have that I don't have?

26:37.929 --> 26:40.693
I did not carry on an affair with the cousin...

26:40.765 --> 26:43.598
and I will take a goddamn polygraph
to that effect.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.362
I want you to leave this house, Tony.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.202
Please. I want you to leave me alone.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.677
What about the kids?

26:58.750 --> 27:01.913
Yeah, it's horrible. God help them.

27:36.755 --> 27:39.121
Open the fucking door, or I'll kick it in!

27:44.195 --> 27:45.594
She's not there.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.228
Probably she hides in Brighton Beach.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.358
She blames you for Ronnie Zellman.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.162
You beat him with belt.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.267
He felt weak in front of her.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.464
She told me he couldn't perform.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.812
They broke up not so long after.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.280
Oh, fuck that!

28:11.356 --> 28:14.519
Who told her about us? Not you, please.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.056
It was what's-her-name, right?
The one who walked in on us.

28:19.297 --> 28:22.528
We had bad argument over
FICA and federal withholding.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.295
I take from her paycheck.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.363
Jesus fucking Christ.
FICA and federal withholding?

28:38.349 --> 28:43.184
I gotta go home tomorrow,
and I gotta tell my kids we're separating.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.418
It's going to rip them up.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.985
Divorce is very hard for kids.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.829
After this, they don't trust.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.222
I'm child of divorce.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.703
I shouldn't have been drinking
in the afternoon.

29:06.377 --> 29:09.244
How about a little sympathy here?
You got ice in your veins?

29:09.314 --> 29:11.748
I had ice in my veins on your uncle couch?

29:11.816 --> 29:13.841
Most expensive piece of ass I ever had.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.682
Right. I know what you are thinking, too.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.423
Take care, Tony.
You're a strong guy, you'll be all right.

30:40.238 --> 30:41.603
What's up?

30:41.706 --> 30:44.174
So, how's it going with Christopher home?

30:44.909 --> 30:47.537
Good. That place was a godsend.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.641
So, the wedding's back on?

30:51.082 --> 30:52.879
We haven't talked about it.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.213
Except...

30:59.457 --> 31:00.617
Except what?

31:04.495 --> 31:07.396
He says he isn't sure anymore
he'd be a good father...

31:08.833 --> 31:10.357
after killing my dog.

31:13.338 --> 31:14.703
You have kids?

31:16.274 --> 31:19.334
So, how's Tony?
He's been house-hunting down the shore?

31:23.948 --> 31:25.438
Beautiful place, too.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.250
What about Ralph?

31:29.487 --> 31:31.478
Cifaretto? Heard anything there?

31:33.358 --> 31:36.418
Chrissy says
he has a pretty serious drug problem, too.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.887
He may have hit bottom somewhere.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.860
Chrissy says he wants to...

31:41.165 --> 31:44.191
you know, help get him in recovery
when he resurfaces.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.605
You know Ralph's
second-in-command, Vito?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.974
Yeah, the fat guy.

31:52.443 --> 31:56.174
When Christopher was away, I had
that asshole calling me every five minutes...

31:56.247 --> 31:57.908
to see if I "needed anything. "

31:57.982 --> 32:00.974
No! Does Christopher know?

32:01.085 --> 32:03.019
You kidding me? He'd kill him.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.814
Not really, I mean...

32:06.658 --> 32:08.353
You know, he'd be angry.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.699
I'm supposed to meet my mom.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.264
Go ahead.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.341
Thank you.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.338
<i>I saw your car. Qué pasa?</i>

33:09.354 --> 33:11.288
Things aren't very good at home...

33:11.356 --> 33:13.881
so I came down to sleep on my boat.

33:14.425 --> 33:18.657
And it was being refinished,
and the smell of the paint drove me out.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.125
I'm sorry, I've been up to bat three times.

33:21.199 --> 33:25.260
Yeah, I think she's thinking of separating.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.774
What you wanna do,
go around and meet perfunctorily...

33:30.842 --> 33:33.072
with all the top divorce attorneys
in your area.

33:33.144 --> 33:36.443
That way, if the worst happens,
they can't take her on as a client.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.038
Conflict of interest.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.648
- That's pretty good.
- Just do it, fella.

33:43.054 --> 33:45.989
But you must find a hotel
until you officially take possession.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.150
Something happens to you, I'm liable.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.887
Let me just clean up a little.

34:08.079 --> 34:11.310
- Hi, I'm Tony.
- I know who you are. Come in, please.

34:13.951 --> 34:16.647
Tony, what's up?

34:20.291 --> 34:24.556
You know that thing we were talking about,
this thing with me and my wife?

34:24.929 --> 34:26.328
Alan just told me.

34:27.532 --> 34:30.797
The thing is, in light of it,
I was going over it in the shower...

34:30.868 --> 34:33.735
and I realized that
as much as I want this place...

34:34.138 --> 34:36.868
now is not the time for me
to be buying a house.

34:38.342 --> 34:42.505
Sorry, I know it's a big disappointment.
You ought to see how I feel.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.940
I want to get my deposit back,
and I'll get out of your life.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.179
It's just not that clear to me
how your marital situation...

34:50.254 --> 34:51.652
negates the purchase.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.985
I mean, most of this was for my kids.

34:54.559 --> 34:55.583
For my wife.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.787
- That is so sad.
- Excuse me, honey.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.092
We had that place on the market
a year and a half.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.462
We had two offers: You and the Kims.

35:02.533 --> 35:03.795
So, what about them?

35:03.868 --> 35:08.100
The Kims? I can't go back to them.
I guess I could, but I'm not going to.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.901
They'd hold my feet to the fire.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.000
I don't want to be insensitive
with what you got on your plate...

35:13.077 --> 35:14.704
but we had a signed contract.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.110
- Alan.
- No! Baloney!

35:16.180 --> 35:19.013
I dumped a buyer
'cause they seemed to love the place.

35:19.083 --> 35:23.144
- It was the cash and the short escrow.
- Look, who knows what's going to happen?

35:23.221 --> 35:25.451
You guys could be back together
in a month...

35:25.523 --> 35:27.718
leaving A.S., here, fucked in the ass.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.426
Whatever.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.999
What's the big deal?
Why don't you just let me out of this thing?

35:39.070 --> 35:40.799
I can't, I have partners.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.732
Excuse me.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.502
I got to take this.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.475
It was very nice to meet you.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.884
But I'm not buying your house.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.615
That guy's a mobster.

36:01.959 --> 36:04.826
They buy houses from people,
they conduct business.

36:05.029 --> 36:08.123
I dealt with them
on that Neapolitan copyright thing for Enya.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.791
I'll probably let him walk...

36:09.867 --> 36:13.030
but that's a negotiation,
which he knows full well.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.935
You don't have any partners.

36:15.006 --> 36:15.995
Thank you, Rabbi.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.670
<i>l just talked to Carmine.</i>

36:19.744 --> 36:21.041
He's ready to settle.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.579
Are you kidding me?

36:23.114 --> 36:24.513
Everything's in motion.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.072
<i>Welcome to my world.</i>

36:39.163 --> 36:40.152
Have a seat.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.640
I'm sorry to learn
about the marital situation, Tony.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.240
Our thing is more than a livelihood.

36:52.510 --> 36:56.469
One of us suffers a personal tragedy,
falls ill and whatnot...

36:56.948 --> 36:58.540
we all feel it deeply...

36:59.116 --> 37:01.346
no matter what kind of acrimony
is in the air.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.683
What's in the air is
you're losing a lot of money.

37:03.754 --> 37:06.222
We all agree
we want to get back to earning...

37:06.290 --> 37:08.281
but I reiterate again...

37:08.559 --> 37:12.552
Zellman had a hand in HUD,
so I can't, as a matter of principle...

37:12.863 --> 37:14.353
relinquish my claim.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.059
So?

37:17.134 --> 37:21.264
I said 40, you said 5.5,
which was ridiculous.

37:22.006 --> 37:25.100
Let's split the difference. 20 percent.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.446
All right, 15.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.848
You know what?

37:37.221 --> 37:39.917
In the interest of putting this shit to bed...

37:40.124 --> 37:42.319
if that's what it's going to take...

37:43.060 --> 37:44.049
15.

37:48.633 --> 37:49.622
Good.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.406
My son was a big help in all this.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.738
I want you always to remember that...

37:58.809 --> 38:00.299
even after I'm gone.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.007
But I'm not going no place.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.345
Healthy as a fucking rhino, this guy.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.350
You stay that way.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.557
Did you get any sleep?

38:23.167 --> 38:24.566
A little, I think.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.639
Maybe it would be better
if you went back to school.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.871
Got your head into your schoolwork.
Be with your friends.

38:34.345 --> 38:37.371
I'd just be thinking about
what's going on here all the time.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.343
I just keep thinking...

38:43.220 --> 38:45.120
I used to feel so superior...

38:45.189 --> 38:48.522
because so many of my friends
had these fucked-up, divorced parents.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.260
I guess I did, too.

38:51.095 --> 38:52.357
And, like, Finn...

38:53.064 --> 38:55.794
I'm not saying I want kids, but if we did...

38:57.568 --> 38:59.468
I used to imagine...

38:59.970 --> 39:03.633
we'd all be together
on the holidays, Christmas...

39:04.408 --> 39:06.273
all around this big fire.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.074
You will have a wonderful future, Meadow.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.775
We had a lot of wonderful times as a family.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.118
All predicated on bullshit.

39:19.623 --> 39:23.787
I don't want to fight with you, Meadow.
That's not true. I think you know it.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.230
It was 'cause of Furio, wasn't it?

39:37.274 --> 39:39.208
Who said anything about Furio?

39:40.845 --> 39:43.507
I have never been unfaithful to your father.

39:46.517 --> 39:47.609
Daddy was.

39:50.187 --> 39:53.213
This is not something I want to talk about.
I'm sorry.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.115
Not now, not ever.

39:57.762 --> 40:01.493
Jesus, how could you eat shit from him
for all those years?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.406
Fresh pepper?

40:13.477 --> 40:14.944
Just a little.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.178
About you and Carmela...

40:26.223 --> 40:27.315
I'm sorry.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.188
<i>This is not al dente.</i>

40:47.611 --> 40:48.635
Hello?

40:48.712 --> 40:50.077
Fucking amazing, huh?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.307
Well, I guess that's that.

40:57.988 --> 41:00.513
Things have a momentum of their own.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.990
More is lost by indecision
than wrong decision.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.322
<i>That's a good point.</i>

41:12.236 --> 41:14.568
Okay, then. You'll hear from me.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.841
That was J.S.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.042
- We're not on for Tuesday no more, right?
- Wrong.

41:30.087 --> 41:31.520
Johnny Sack.

41:32.256 --> 41:35.783
I always worked very fucking hard
to make him think I liked him.

41:36.527 --> 41:38.654
I'd try to feel him out about shit.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.626
I think he and Ralphie were in bed
in some way.

41:45.402 --> 41:47.427
It went bad with that joke shit.

41:52.943 --> 41:54.638
We reached an agreement.

41:55.112 --> 41:58.479
When Tony gave him his final number,
Carmine's Depends blew out.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.312
Oh, my fucking back!

42:00.518 --> 42:03.578
That cot at the pork store,
not really good for sleeping, T.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.122
With all due love and respect to Carmela...

42:06.857 --> 42:09.985
I'd put her shit out on the curb
and let it rain on her.

42:10.294 --> 42:13.695
You can't disrupt the kids.
That shit traumatizes them for life.

42:13.764 --> 42:15.823
It's his house as much as it is hers.

42:15.966 --> 42:17.490
More. I paid for it.

42:17.568 --> 42:20.401
That's right, T, I'm on your side on this.

42:27.745 --> 42:30.714
She's the one who talked me into
buying it in the first place.

42:30.781 --> 42:34.217
Now I'm out in the streets?
These fucking phones.

42:35.586 --> 42:37.486
We were better off years ago.

42:43.527 --> 42:44.619
What?

42:44.762 --> 42:46.161
I hadn't heard from you.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.290
My partners and I have decided
to let you out of your obligation.

42:49.366 --> 42:51.493
I want my $200,000 by the end of the week.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.037
As to that, I'm not rescinding the deposit.

42:54.171 --> 42:57.231
That's what they're for,
to hold parties to agreements.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.866
If you want to make me an offer...

43:00.878 --> 43:02.869
No, I think I'll buy the house.

43:04.481 --> 43:07.780
My family has parties
till 4:00, 5:00 in the morning.

43:07.851 --> 43:08.818
I can show damages.

43:08.886 --> 43:11.753
I'm being generous in not bringing action
to enforce the sale.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.050
Damages?

43:13.857 --> 43:15.984
<i>- They haven't started yet.
- Listen to me.</i>

43:16.060 --> 43:19.461
There's a paper trail to our dispute,
and Virginia Lupo's a witness.

43:19.530 --> 43:22.988
A hair on my head gets mussed,
the authorities will know where to look.

43:23.067 --> 43:25.695
Alan, you misread me entirely.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.367
You must think I'm a fucking thug.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.168
Just be forewarned.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.935
<i>You're not getting your deposit back!</i>

43:42.486 --> 43:44.386
Jesus, you scared me to death.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.695
This is my house, Carmela,
and I'm not leaving.

43:58.235 --> 44:01.136
Get out of here, Tony.
I asked you once, nicely.

44:05.175 --> 44:06.540
All right, look.

44:07.177 --> 44:09.270
I know what happened was wrong.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.779
I was an asshole, and I apologize.

44:12.950 --> 44:15.578
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

44:17.921 --> 44:19.445
I said, "Get out. "

44:20.324 --> 44:21.348
Make me.

44:21.425 --> 44:25.418
I have an appointment with a lawyer, Tony.
I will get a restraining order.

44:25.863 --> 44:28.127
A lawyer? Go ahead.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.265
You know what? Call him.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.427
Here, use my phone.

44:34.371 --> 44:35.497
Fine, stay.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.005
Come here. You're not going anywhere.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.939
Let go of me. Your son will be home.

44:40.010 --> 44:43.173
- You want him to see you like this?
- You'd love that, wouldn't you?

44:43.247 --> 44:46.774
- I'm not leaving here.
- I don't love you anymore!

44:46.850 --> 44:50.308
I don't want you!
You are not sleeping in my bed, Tony!

44:50.521 --> 44:52.716
The thought of it now makes me sick!

44:55.659 --> 44:58.594
Jesus Christ Almighty,
I'm going fucking crazy!

45:17.047 --> 45:19.038
Think Mom's going to let you stay out here?

45:19.116 --> 45:21.346
Let? This is my house.

45:23.287 --> 45:25.221
Ain't it better when I'm here?

45:25.622 --> 45:26.919
Well, sure.

45:27.591 --> 45:30.856
Come on. We'll bring them down
to the garage tomorrow.

45:34.631 --> 45:35.996
What time is it?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.460
- You just getting home?
- We were studying.

45:40.637 --> 45:41.661
Oh, yeah?

45:41.739 --> 45:44.640
From now on,
I'm going to take a bigger hand in this shit.

45:44.708 --> 45:46.369
I'm going to be right out here.

45:46.443 --> 45:49.970
I want you to be respectful to your mother.
She's having a hard time.

45:50.047 --> 45:52.447
- Did she say something?
- I'm just saying.

45:54.785 --> 45:57.447
All right. Go to bed. It's a school night.

46:52.209 --> 46:55.269
<i>The audiences have been given
an abundance of programming...</i>

46:55.445 --> 46:58.608
<i>and they vote every hour,
every minute, every five minutes...</i>

46:58.682 --> 47:00.240
<i>with their remotes.</i>

47:01.485 --> 47:04.283
Thanks, by the way,
for drinking wine in front of me.

47:06.857 --> 47:08.825
- Hello?
- Call it off.

47:09.293 --> 47:11.090
<i>- The old guy.
- Yeah?</i>

47:13.030 --> 47:16.591
- Something don't make sense here.
- You think it's a setup?

47:17.134 --> 47:18.761
<i>Not necessarily, but...</i>

47:19.236 --> 47:22.296
our friend is very anxious
to pass the ball, the prick.

47:22.573 --> 47:25.167
<i>But nobody can know
this was ever considered.</i>

47:25.843 --> 47:27.970
I'll offer my guys
half of what they'd have got.

47:28.045 --> 47:30.946
- That should do it.
- I just want you to make sure.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.713
<i>l told you that.</i>

47:32.783 --> 47:35.718
<i>So it behooves us
to protect what we've earned.</i>

48:04.848 --> 48:06.179
It's all there.

48:06.984 --> 48:10.147
If you get the taste
to chip a little "H" again...

48:12.956 --> 48:16.016
- don't forget to call us.
- Like we said, you'll keep this quiet.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.028
- I got the mouth on a statue, nigga.
- Word.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.927
See you around.

48:33.977 --> 48:36.241
He ain't quit. He's just freshening up.

48:36.313 --> 48:38.474
Don't say jack shit to Kaesha about this...

48:38.548 --> 48:41.381
or she be haunting my ass
for that child support...

49:47.818 --> 49:48.807
What?

49:49.686 --> 49:53.713
I was wondering when you would move
those theater seats down to the garage.

49:57.527 --> 49:58.619
Seriously?

49:59.096 --> 50:01.724
That's what you came out here
to talk to me about?

50:01.798 --> 50:04.198
They are on the lawn. They'll ruin the grass.

50:04.267 --> 50:06.394
Bad for the grass!

50:08.138 --> 50:12.575
I can't put the sprinklers on over there
without the seats getting wet.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.312
They're your seats.
I don't want to wreck them.

50:16.380 --> 50:17.904
I'll get right on it.

50:22.919 --> 50:25.979
Why do you have to make
even this little thing so difficult?

50:26.056 --> 50:28.616
What possible reason could you have
for coming here...

50:28.692 --> 50:31.456
to talk to me about theater seats
except to bust my balls?

50:31.528 --> 50:33.689
I wanted to water while I was out.

50:34.598 --> 50:36.225
Yeah, right.

50:39.803 --> 50:40.792
Fuck you.

50:42.105 --> 50:44.005
It's going to cost you $3.

50:49.946 --> 50:52.346
You know what, Tony? What's done is done.

50:53.316 --> 50:55.807
We are where we are, and it's for the best.

50:56.186 --> 50:59.747
But just for the record,
or it might even interest you to know...

50:59.856 --> 51:04.190
that I might actually have gone on
with your cheating and your bullshit...

51:05.462 --> 51:09.159
if your attitude around here
had been even the least bit loving...

51:09.232 --> 51:10.927
cooperative, interested.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.736
Whose idea was Whitecaps?

51:19.176 --> 51:23.510
It is just a bigger version of an emerald ring,
so you can keep on with your other life.

51:23.580 --> 51:25.013
You don't know me at all.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.210
I know you better than anybody, Tony.
Even your friends.

51:28.819 --> 51:31.447
- Which is probably why you hate me.
- Hate you?

51:33.990 --> 51:36.515
Don't worry, I'm going to hell when I die.

51:38.061 --> 51:40.894
Nice thing to say to a person
heading into an MRI.

51:59.616 --> 52:00.981
You know, Tony...

52:02.719 --> 52:04.983
I have always been sorry I said that.

52:06.990 --> 52:08.355
You were my guy.

52:10.026 --> 52:13.928
You could be so sweet.
Nobody could make me laugh like you.

52:18.869 --> 52:21.838
Who the fuck did you think I was
when you married me?

52:22.105 --> 52:26.269
You knew my father. You grew up around
Dickie Moltisanti and your uncle Eddie.

52:26.343 --> 52:28.641
Where do you get off
acting surprised and miffed...

52:28.712 --> 52:30.805
when there are women on the side?

52:30.914 --> 52:32.677
- You knew the deal.
- Deal?

52:32.949 --> 52:34.246
Your mom talks all she wants...

52:34.317 --> 52:36.649
about what's-his-name
and his chain of drugstores.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.883
Both of us know the other boyfriend
you were debating marrying...

52:39.956 --> 52:43.221
was Jerry Tufi,
with his father's snowplow business.

52:43.426 --> 52:46.657
And we now know that
that wouldn't have suited you at all.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.757
You really don't hear me, do you?

52:50.667 --> 52:55.161
- You think, for me, it's all about things.
- No, I forced all this shit on you.

52:55.872 --> 53:00.036
What you really crave is a little Hyundai
and a simple gold heart on a chain.

53:00.710 --> 53:02.803
You are so fucking hateful.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.785
Can I tell you something, Tony?

53:09.853 --> 53:11.980
Don't pretend like I got a choice.

53:12.289 --> 53:13.654
The last year...

53:14.090 --> 53:19.050
I have been dreaming, and fantasizing,
and in love with Furio.

53:24.935 --> 53:27.199
Every morning,
when he'd come to pick you up...

53:27.270 --> 53:30.501
I would look forward to it
all night long, in bed...

53:30.774 --> 53:31.934
next to you.

53:32.576 --> 53:35.067
Those nights when you were
actually in the bed.

53:35.145 --> 53:37.204
And he would ring the doorbell...

53:37.280 --> 53:40.807
I felt like my heart
would come out of my chest.

53:41.685 --> 53:44.245
He would smile, and we'd talk.

53:45.222 --> 53:47.349
And then you would come down the stairs.

53:47.424 --> 53:50.951
And I felt probably like someone
who is terminally ill...

53:51.027 --> 53:53.860
and, somehow,
they manage to forget it for a minute.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.361
And then it all comes back.

54:03.573 --> 54:07.703
- He'd talk to you! Poor you!
- He made me feel like I mattered!

54:07.777 --> 54:11.178
You asked me the other day
what Irina's cousin has that you don't have.

54:11.248 --> 54:14.115
And I thought about it,
because it is a pretty good question.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.347
She is sexy, even with the one pin gone,
but that's not it.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.321
I could converse with her,
because she had something to say!

54:20.390 --> 54:23.484
I am here! I have things to say!

54:23.560 --> 54:26.996
Besides "Bring the chairs down,"
and "Did you sign the living trust?"

54:27.063 --> 54:29.554
She is a grown woman
who has been kicked around...

54:29.633 --> 54:32.796
and she's been on her own,
and has had to fight and struggle.

54:32.869 --> 54:34.461
Unlike me, is that it?

54:35.038 --> 54:37.131
Who the fuck wanted it like this?

54:37.374 --> 54:40.400
Who the fuck pissed and moaned
at just the idea...

54:40.477 --> 54:42.445
of me with a real estate license?

54:42.545 --> 54:46.345
Free to sit back for 20 fucking years
and fiddle with the air conditioning...

54:46.416 --> 54:51.410
and fucking bitch and complain to me!

54:51.554 --> 54:53.784
To your priest! Fuck it!

55:02.432 --> 55:05.401
Who knew, all this time,
you wanted Tracy and Hepburn?

55:08.905 --> 55:13.467
What about the thousand other pigs
you had your dick in over the years?

55:13.677 --> 55:16.339
The strippers, the cocktail waitresses.

55:16.646 --> 55:19.206
Were you best friends with all of them, too?

55:20.917 --> 55:22.578
You fucking hypocrite.

55:45.075 --> 55:47.805
The judge is calling you all
into the courtroom.

55:51.514 --> 55:52.742
Okay, thanks.

56:23.780 --> 56:25.771
<i>The number you are caling was blocked...</i>

56:25.849 --> 56:29.216
<i>and cannot be caled back
using your last-cal- return service.</i>

56:40.363 --> 56:42.729
"We are still hopelessly deadlocked.

56:43.833 --> 56:47.667
"One juror refuses to deliberate,
and can't be reasoned with.

56:47.871 --> 56:49.099
"What should we do now?"

56:49.172 --> 56:52.073
Your Honor,
again, I must move for a mistrial.

56:52.342 --> 56:56.676
Your Honor, the government asks
that you give them another Allen charge...

56:57.013 --> 56:59.413
to go back and try again.

56:59.716 --> 57:02.617
As much as I'd like to,
this jury's been at it a long time.

57:02.685 --> 57:06.348
I don't see where one or two more days
is going to change anything.

57:06.890 --> 57:08.289
Bring in the jury.

57:25.241 --> 57:29.405
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I see that you are hopelessly deadlocked...

57:29.879 --> 57:33.076
and I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

57:33.883 --> 57:36.249
I know that you did the best you could.

57:38.221 --> 57:40.519
You have performed a valuable service.

57:40.890 --> 57:42.357
You may be excused.

57:58.708 --> 58:01.768
Stay in touch.
Call me when your grandson is born.

58:02.946 --> 58:05.540
I wouldn't want to think of you on that day.

58:11.621 --> 58:12.610
Dad.

58:13.523 --> 58:14.854
Battle of Tarawa.

58:15.258 --> 58:16.987
Marines had no air cover.

58:17.827 --> 58:19.294
It was a slaughter.

58:23.967 --> 58:26.026
War? I don't know.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.131
There's Coke in there.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.640
Can I move in here?

58:33.443 --> 58:36.469
- What's wrong with your room?
- I can't take it anymore.

58:36.946 --> 58:40.438
Mom's just on my case all the time.
My dinner got cold.

58:41.117 --> 58:44.780
So, I was on the phone with Devin.
We had to do an algebra problem.

58:51.494 --> 58:54.395
Look, I told you
she's having a hard time right now.

58:55.098 --> 58:58.693
- She goes to a lot of trouble to cook meals.
- I didn't ask her to.

58:58.902 --> 59:01.962
And it's not fair.
Why do I have to get stuck with her?

59:02.272 --> 59:04.638
Don't talk about your mother like that.

59:05.241 --> 59:07.539
You don't have to put up
with her shit anymore.

59:07.610 --> 59:10.010
I heard you tell her off out by the pool.

59:12.081 --> 59:13.878
You're not staying in here.

59:13.950 --> 59:16.111
- Get that out of your head right now.
- Why not?

59:16.185 --> 59:19.951
It would hurt her feelings that you don't
want to be in her part of the house.

59:22.125 --> 59:24.320
Your old amp's hooked back up.

59:32.735 --> 59:35.295
Be careful with that speaker.
You banged the other one.

59:35.371 --> 59:37.601
What are you gonna do
without your front speakers?

59:37.674 --> 59:40.472
- I'll take them.
- They're just borrowing them.

59:40.543 --> 59:42.340
I'll come back for the amp.

59:43.112 --> 59:46.639
You can come here and watch TV with me,
but you can't stay here.

59:47.884 --> 59:48.873
Fuck.

59:53.690 --> 59:58.093
Go buy her one of those CDs she likes,
and some flowers.

59:59.162 --> 01:00:02.563
Tell her you're sorry,
that you'll try to be more considerate.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:24.252
We should call everybody, have a big party.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:32.124
Call Volpe's and have them send over
a couple of pies, but that's it.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.856
There's a hearty Burgundy still in the fridge.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.895
I don't suppose Tony would come...

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:47.269
with what's going on up at that abattoir.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.879
I don't think so, Uncle Jun'.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:02.117
<i>I want to get one large cheese and tomato,
and then one with alici.</i>

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:03.887
Yeah, it's me.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:11.624
<i>l got you to hold my hand</i>

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:16.830
<i>Babe</i>

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.636
<i>l got you, babe</i>

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:22.806
<i>l got you, babe</i>

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:29.184
Go down by the cellar door. See if
Murf left the envelope under the flagstone.

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:32.312
He wouldn't have been around today.
I'll go look later.

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.549
Do it now. Is that asking so much?

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.885
I just went through the trial of my life.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.104
To wonderful friends...

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:25.163
to Alan's shark fin soup...

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:27.172
and to a wonderful day.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.503
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:36.846
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Sands Hotel proudly presents...</i>

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.546
<i>the star of our show...</i>

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:41.590
<i>direct from the bar, Dean Martin!</i>

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.088
What the hell?

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.199
It's that boat.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.708
"Stugots"?

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.980
Fucking goombah trash.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:15.217
This whole shoreline's turning
into the Gulf of Sorrento.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:18.191
Buddy! Turn it down!

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:10.705
Been waiting long?

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:15.015
Sorry, I was interviewing divorce lawyers.

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:18.315
That's why I always ask myself,
"Is it worth it financially?"

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.949
You and Ginny are the old married couple.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:24.856
Marriage can be very hard work
if both aren't pulling that load.

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:30.297
I was wondering, why the delay?

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.293
I was gonna call you.

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.765
You're not gonna be happy.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.168
I'm out.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.304
Whacking a boss is bad for business.

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.247
- And now that he's settled...
- We can weather it.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:48.840
It's not just the internal upheaval.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:53.711
Mr. And Mrs. John Q. America,
by and large, they sit still for our shit.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.622
So, people get ripped off,
they figure it's not them.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:59.388
But if it's the fucking O.K. Corral out there...

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.189
the Feds take heat.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.493
- This is very disappointing.
- I know.

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.530
But he's an old man.
You're gonna get your chance soon enough.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:13.700
Don't go into coaching, Tony.
It's not your long suit.

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:17.178
- What I was gonna say...
- Tomorrow, I go in to work.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:21.216
"Creeps on this petty pace. "

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.410
And I take orders from him again?

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:27.814
Or that disgusting, fucking,
cocksucker idiot son of his?

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.489
- I shouldn't be hearing that.
- Really?

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.459
What I was gonna say was...

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.132
it's a major step...

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:48.168
but if you wanna do it,
without me as a partner...

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.769
you do what you gotta do.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:54.340
I will never, ever reveal any conversation
we ever had.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:58.751
The thing is, we had those conversations.
Your mouth was moving along with mine.

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:02.985
We just go back about our business
at the Esplanade, like it never happened?

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:07.357
- That would be the healthy choice.
- Healthy for who?

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.332
Why the fuck would I ever trust somebody
who'd leave me holding my cock like this?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.665
- I shouldn't have heard that either.
- There you go.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.435
There's the fucking problem.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.307
I still consider you a dear friend.

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:13.918
<i>They're actualy moored about two and
a half centimeters away from the fire.</i>

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:17.693
<i>So, they are finaly making
a little bit of an impact with their buckets.</i>

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:24.299
I didn't know you were in the house.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.302
- Just stopped by to pick up a few things.
- Fine.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:38.277
<i>The geeks are realy making
some progress now!</i>

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:43.357
Turn that off and come here.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.992
Got something to say to your mom.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.052
I might as well tell you at the same time.

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:50.121
- It's almost over.
- Now.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:05.312
I've been thinking about things,
me living out there.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.841
I've decided it's probably not a good idea.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.357
What's going on?

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:31.033
I was just telling everybody...

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.837
it's probably better
if I don't live here anymore.

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:41.113
Because I wanted to stay in there with you?
I won't ask.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.343
- I just got pissed off.
- He asked to live with you?

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:52.359
No, A.J. Come here.

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.728
That's not why.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.832
- Where are you gonna go?
- Don't worry about it.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.072
You should go back to counseling.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.450
It's better this way.

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.783
He's making the right decision.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:25.486
He'll get a place, you will go and visit.
It'll be better, you'll see.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.792
You guys could still get
back together maybe. Right?

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.227
Yeah, sure.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.595
We're still close.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:56.153
God, is there nothing to eat in this house?

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.491
Be careful.

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.020
I'll be at the Plaza.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:47.766
<i>Wel, l don't drink anymore.
l freeze it now and l eat it like a Popsicle.</i>

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:53.608
<i>A drink never hurt nobody. You remember
the great words of Joe E. Lewis.</i>

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:57.237
<i>He says, "You're not drunk if you can lay
on the floor without holding on. "</i>

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.941
Fucking gangster asshole!

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.882
I'll call the police.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:09.651
He'll just turn it down again
when the police boat comes.

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.530
The coast guard.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:20.364
He can keep paying
those $200 fines forever, Alan!

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.970
You've gotta let it go, Alan!

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.030
Give him his money! God!
