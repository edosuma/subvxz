WEBVTT

00:16.776 --> 00:17.976
Are we rolling?

00:17.978 --> 00:19.243
Uh-huh.

00:19.245 --> 00:20.912
The camera never stops.

00:20.914 --> 00:22.246
No matter what anybody says.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.615
Even if I tell you to stop,
keep rolling.

00:24.617 --> 00:26.084
You got it?

00:29.789 --> 00:31.289
Genius.
He-Hey.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.290
Legend in the flesh.

00:32.292 --> 00:33.858
Looking good, Frank.
(laughs)

00:33.860 --> 00:35.193
Well, this is what
a network president
Hey.

00:35.195 --> 00:38.129
looks with a 14 rating
in the demo and a 25 share.

00:38.131 --> 00:39.464
(laughs)

00:39.466 --> 00:41.232
Goddamn right.

00:42.202 --> 00:43.034
Okay, let's, uh,

00:43.036 --> 00:44.335
have a seat, everyone.

00:45.672 --> 00:46.771
Whoa.

00:46.773 --> 00:48.039
(laughs)

00:48.041 --> 00:49.207
W-W-What is this?

00:49.209 --> 00:51.342
This is the beginning
of your next big hit.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.777
Take one, pass it down.

00:52.779 --> 00:54.278
Everyone on camera has
to sign the releases.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.781
Come-Come on, Sidney,
turn them off.

00:56.783 --> 00:58.116
We're not the talent here.

00:58.118 --> 00:59.484
I got news
for you, Frank.

00:59.486 --> 01:01.519
You took a chance
on<i> My Roanoke Nightmare.</i>

01:01.521 --> 01:03.154
That's talent.

01:03.156 --> 01:05.123
(chuckles)
You picked up the
hottest show on TV.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.492
That gives you first
crack at the sequel.

01:07.494 --> 01:09.193
No bullshit.
Okay?

01:09.195 --> 01:10.294
We've all done the math.

01:10.296 --> 01:12.063
14 minutes of
commercials per hour.

01:12.065 --> 01:13.498
That's 28 spots

01:13.500 --> 01:15.166
at $450,000 per spot.

01:15.168 --> 01:16.801
That's $12 million a show.

01:16.803 --> 01:19.537
That is football money
at a fraction of the cost.

01:19.539 --> 01:22.173
So, we are gonna be filming

01:22.175 --> 01:23.541
everything.

01:23.543 --> 01:26.144
People want the reality.

01:26.146 --> 01:28.246
They're interested
in the process.

01:28.248 --> 01:30.248
We have over three million
followers on Twitter;

01:30.250 --> 01:32.083
almost five million likes
on Facebook for the finale;

01:32.085 --> 01:33.851
multiple covers
of<i> Entertainment Weekly;</i>

01:33.853 --> 01:36.988
hundreds of fan sites online;
cons across the country.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.357
The appetite for this show
hasn't even reached its peak!

01:39.359 --> 01:41.492
We have millions
of eyeballs

01:41.494 --> 01:43.161
waiting to see
the next iteration

01:43.163 --> 01:44.862
and you have a chance

01:44.864 --> 01:45.863
to buy it now.

01:45.865 --> 01:47.165
Okay, great.

01:47.167 --> 01:49.000
(chuckles)
So, what is it?

01:49.002 --> 01:53.171
Okay, it's familiar,
but it's different.

01:53.173 --> 01:56.074
<i> Return to Roanoke:</i>
<i> Three Days in Hell.</i>

01:56.076 --> 01:57.675
I'm gonna bring everybody

01:57.677 --> 02:00.445
who lived in that house,
and the actors who played them

02:00.447 --> 02:03.081
on the show, put them
together in that house again.

02:03.083 --> 02:06.784
Only this time, hidden cameras
recording everything.

02:06.786 --> 02:09.754
Are the actors
playing the same roles?

02:09.756 --> 02:11.055
And what are
they reenacting?

02:11.057 --> 02:13.624
Nothing.
The drama is reality.

02:13.626 --> 02:15.059
So, it's like<i> Big Brother.</i>

02:15.061 --> 02:16.861
Bingo, but with scares.

02:16.863 --> 02:18.963
See, they're gonna be
living in that house

02:18.965 --> 02:21.032
over the period
of the blood moon,

02:21.034 --> 02:22.934
when all of the bad shit
happens.

02:22.936 --> 02:25.603
Can you imagine the reactions
when The Butcher shows up?

02:25.605 --> 02:28.206
Or the Chens?

02:28.208 --> 02:31.409
And it'll all be filmed,
24 hours a day.

02:31.411 --> 02:33.611
Okay, I-I don't understand.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.880
Um, you expect--
excuse me.

02:35.882 --> 02:37.248
Thank you.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.118
You want to capture
actual spirits on film?

02:40.120 --> 02:42.653
Like... ghosts?

02:42.655 --> 02:44.322
Well, I expect to capture
real reactions

02:44.324 --> 02:46.324
to what they'll believe
are spirits.

02:46.326 --> 02:49.127
So, it's... fake.

02:49.129 --> 02:50.428
(chuckles)

02:50.430 --> 02:52.263
Reality is what we make of it.

02:52.265 --> 02:53.598
You of all people
should know that.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.166
(chuckles)
A-A-After the show airs,

02:55.168 --> 02:57.268
we neither confirm
nor deny content

02:57.270 --> 02:58.236
and everybody signs
confidentiality agreements.

02:58.238 --> 02:59.770
Well, i-it sounds great.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.606
There's just, uh,
one small niggle.

03:01.608 --> 03:03.241
Our research department

03:03.243 --> 03:04.509
has come up with
some concerns

03:04.511 --> 03:07.812
regarding the ending
of last season.

03:07.814 --> 03:11.249
Uh... a majority of our
audience felt dissatisfied

03:11.251 --> 03:13.084
because the murder of
Mason was never solved.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.620
And the person they
believe did it suffered

03:15.622 --> 03:17.021
no consequences.

03:17.023 --> 03:18.189
Lee.
I get it.

03:18.191 --> 03:19.490
I'm all over it.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.125
Do we even still have the house?

03:21.127 --> 03:22.126
I own it.

03:22.128 --> 03:23.461
I bought it from Matt and Shelby

03:23.463 --> 03:24.829
for fifty cents on the dollar

03:24.831 --> 03:26.264
when we shot the reenactments.

03:26.266 --> 03:27.298
And they're
all willing

03:27.300 --> 03:28.199
to go back there?

03:28.201 --> 03:29.634
I mean...
(chuckles)

03:29.636 --> 03:33.204
that place was
a nightmare.

03:36.042 --> 03:38.042
Where the hell have you been,
Diana?

03:38.044 --> 03:39.510
You missed
the whole thing.
Traffic.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.112
I doubled the license fee

03:41.114 --> 03:42.813
(whispering):
and got 13 episodes
on the air.

03:42.815 --> 03:45.049
You might have
to give them back.

03:45.051 --> 03:47.118
I finally got ahold
of Shelby Miller.
Yeah?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.120
She doesn't want anything
to do with it.

03:49.122 --> 03:51.055
Ugh.

03:51.057 --> 03:53.524
I know.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.303
(inhales deeply)

04:05.305 --> 04:06.804
(exhales loudly)

04:06.806 --> 04:08.806
I can smell the
patchouli from here.

04:12.145 --> 04:13.211
SIDNEY:
Thanks again for agreeing
with this interview.

04:13.213 --> 04:14.478
I don't think we'd have

04:14.480 --> 04:16.180
a show without you.
Yeah, well, I'm not

04:16.182 --> 04:17.515
doing this for you, Sid.

04:17.517 --> 04:20.718
I am here to set
the record straight.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.353
I've read the vile things

04:22.355 --> 04:24.021
that people are saying
about us online.

04:24.023 --> 04:25.323
I hear the comments they make.

04:25.325 --> 04:27.225
I try to ignore it
and live my life,

04:27.227 --> 04:29.060
but at a certain point
you have to...

04:29.062 --> 04:31.162
you have to defend yourself.

04:31.164 --> 04:34.565
People leave hatchets stuck
into my front door.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.901
I've gotten... death threats.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.202
It's...

04:38.204 --> 04:39.337
That must take a toll

04:39.339 --> 04:40.705
on a marriage.

04:40.707 --> 04:42.206
I was so sorry to hear that

04:42.208 --> 04:43.808
you and Matt separated,
by the way.

04:45.178 --> 04:48.179
Yeah.

04:48.181 --> 04:50.014
You know,
we thought that, um...

04:50.016 --> 04:51.682
(laughs)
We thought that doing the show

04:51.684 --> 04:54.885
would be a healing experience,

04:54.887 --> 04:57.088
maybe help us...

04:57.090 --> 04:58.122
process everything.

04:58.124 --> 05:00.224
It just made us...

05:00.226 --> 05:01.392
relive it all.

05:01.394 --> 05:02.960
Is that what led to the thing

05:02.962 --> 05:04.128
with Dominic Banks?

05:05.465 --> 05:06.631
PAPARAZZO:
Shelby Miller!
PAPARAZZO 2: Dominic!

05:06.633 --> 05:08.099
Dominic Banks!

05:08.101 --> 05:09.400
Is this a date?
All right, guys, back up.

05:09.402 --> 05:11.235
Come on, back it up, back it up.
Shelby! Shelby!

05:11.237 --> 05:12.870
Let's go. Dude, come on.
PAPARAZZO 1:
Does Matt know you're out

05:12.872 --> 05:15.206
with his celebrity
doppelganger tonight?

05:20.813 --> 05:22.813
I can't... I-I'm not, I'm not

05:22.815 --> 05:24.115
gonna do... I can't
really do this.

05:24.117 --> 05:25.216
Not with the...
Yeah.

05:25.218 --> 05:26.484
Billy, can we cut?
(sniffs)

05:26.486 --> 05:28.085
Yeah, can we cut it there?

05:28.087 --> 05:30.288
Thanks. I'm sorry.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.889
Sorry.

05:31.891 --> 05:33.257
I'm sorry. I shouldn't...

05:33.259 --> 05:35.126
I shouldn't have brought up
the affair.

05:35.128 --> 05:37.061
SHELBY:
"Affair"? (sniffles)

05:37.063 --> 05:40.564
I wouldn't call a stupid,
weekend fling an "affair."

05:40.566 --> 05:42.333
I was lonely.

05:42.335 --> 05:44.335
My husband wasn't talking
to me, so I settled

05:44.337 --> 05:45.636
for the...

05:45.638 --> 05:47.271
(sighs)

05:47.273 --> 05:49.106
...for the
cheap imitation.

05:49.108 --> 05:51.509
Matt hasn't spoken
to me since.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.912
(sighs)

05:56.816 --> 05:59.583
Which is why...

05:59.585 --> 06:02.286
when I go back
to Roanoke...

06:02.288 --> 06:04.689
Wait, but you...
you want to do the show?
No.

06:04.691 --> 06:05.990
Of course I don't
want to do the show,

06:05.992 --> 06:08.993
but if... look,
Matt can't avoid me

06:08.995 --> 06:10.761
if we are locked in that
house together, so...

06:10.763 --> 06:12.096
That's great.

06:12.098 --> 06:13.931
This... this...

06:13.933 --> 06:17.134
this... because I-I know
the fans, they want to see...

06:17.136 --> 06:20.171
they want to see you guys
have a real happy ending.

06:20.173 --> 06:21.305
If I do this...

06:21.307 --> 06:23.140
Mm-hmm.

06:23.142 --> 06:25.343
...Dominic cannot
be involved.

06:25.345 --> 06:27.044
I will not do that
to Matt.

06:27.046 --> 06:28.346
Not a problem.

06:28.348 --> 06:30.114
Dominic Banks is out.

06:30.116 --> 06:32.683
What's the status
on Dominic's deal?

06:32.685 --> 06:35.052
Casting closed him today.

06:35.054 --> 06:37.188
Beautiful.

06:49.202 --> 06:50.234
SIDNEY:
Wait, wait.

06:50.236 --> 06:52.069
What the hell
are you doing?

06:52.071 --> 06:54.338
Could you make the camera
placement any more obvious?

06:54.340 --> 06:56.040
Well, they know there's
gonna be cameras, Sid.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.308
Well, of course
they know,

06:57.310 --> 06:59.043
but we want them to forget.
Take that down.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.344
Put it in the corner.

07:00.346 --> 07:02.413
ight there.
(snaps fingers)

07:02.415 --> 07:03.414
Nice.

07:03.416 --> 07:04.982
Where are we
with the rest?

07:04.984 --> 07:06.150
Uh, we should have
at least four cameras

07:06.152 --> 07:09.019
in every room of the
house by nightfall.

07:09.021 --> 07:11.255
Perfect.

07:11.257 --> 07:12.723
Mack, hey.
Hey, what's up, man?

07:12.725 --> 07:14.058
What do you got for me?
Hey.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.659
Ah, sweetness.
Follow me right in here.

07:15.661 --> 07:17.828
Prepare to be amazed.

07:17.830 --> 07:18.829
Ready?

07:18.831 --> 07:19.930
Yeah.

07:19.932 --> 07:21.932
(pipes rumbling)

07:21.934 --> 07:23.634
(rattling)

07:28.241 --> 07:30.808
(rattling continues)

07:32.111 --> 07:33.444
(screams)

07:33.446 --> 07:35.780
(laughing)
Oh, God!

07:35.782 --> 07:37.047
Oh, what is that smell?

07:37.049 --> 07:38.115
Sulfur.

07:38.117 --> 07:39.417
That is genius.

07:39.419 --> 07:40.851
SIDNEY:
What about the windows

07:40.853 --> 07:42.253
in the living room?

07:42.255 --> 07:43.187
You give the order,

07:43.189 --> 07:44.221
those babies are gonna explode

07:44.223 --> 07:46.524
like the (bleep) Fourth of July.

07:46.526 --> 07:50.294
(imitates Cricket):
That's a call back
to Cricket's séance.

07:50.296 --> 07:51.395
(loud banging)

07:51.397 --> 07:52.396
(screams)

07:52.398 --> 07:53.397
(laughs)

07:53.399 --> 07:54.432
(screams)

07:54.434 --> 07:56.801
Oh, that's (bleep) great.

07:56.803 --> 07:58.569
That's (bleep) great.

07:58.571 --> 07:59.870
All right, follow me.
There's more.

07:59.872 --> 08:01.338
Just, uh, watch your step.

08:07.747 --> 08:10.314
(whispering):
What is this shit?

08:10.316 --> 08:13.484
All right... and, uh...

08:13.486 --> 08:14.885
okay.

08:16.122 --> 08:18.589
I am too afraid to stay
in the house now.

08:18.591 --> 08:20.057
I fear whatever malevolent force

08:20.059 --> 08:21.892
is in there
is trying to kill me.

08:21.894 --> 08:24.061
I find myself hiding
in the cellar.

08:24.063 --> 08:25.396
What? Didn't
you like that?

08:25.398 --> 08:27.832
...this house. Help!

08:27.834 --> 08:29.600
Can I talk to you
without the cameras on?

08:29.602 --> 08:31.902
Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

08:34.106 --> 08:35.105
What?!

08:35.107 --> 08:36.273
Look, uh...

08:36.275 --> 08:38.476
one reason
why the show...

08:38.478 --> 08:41.111
why the show was so popular
is because it felt real.

08:41.113 --> 08:43.113
Do you really want
gimmicky pop-up scares?

08:43.115 --> 08:45.182
I'm not interested in
doing another horror show.

08:45.184 --> 08:47.651
I'm interested in using
horror to find justice.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.120
These aren't pop-up scares
for the sake of scares.

08:50.122 --> 08:51.455
These are gonna lead
to the truth, okay?

08:51.457 --> 08:54.158
I'm gonna be the guy
who gets Lee Harris

08:54.160 --> 08:55.659
to admit what she did.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.194
We don't know that
she killed her husband.

08:57.196 --> 08:59.263
That's right.
That's right.

08:59.265 --> 09:00.931
The only people who know
for sure are gonna be

09:00.933 --> 09:03.501
in this house locked
together 24/7.

09:03.503 --> 09:04.702
We put enough
pressure on them,

09:04.704 --> 09:06.237
somebody's gonna slip up.

09:07.306 --> 09:08.372
Wait.

09:08.374 --> 09:09.940
Whoa, whoa, what are those?

09:09.942 --> 09:11.175
They're our
production trailers.

09:11.177 --> 09:12.510
I can see that.

09:12.512 --> 09:13.978
Why are they here?

09:13.980 --> 09:16.013
Where else would they be?

09:17.950 --> 09:20.484
Diana, how many times do
I have to explain this to you?

09:20.486 --> 09:23.120
We need the cast to think
that this is real.

09:23.122 --> 09:24.889
That's not gonna happen
if they look out the window

09:24.891 --> 09:26.557
and see trailers parked
in the (bleep) yard.

09:26.559 --> 09:29.026
Hey, can you... can you move
those out about a half-mile

09:29.028 --> 09:30.494
and hide it in the woods?

09:30.496 --> 09:32.296
There should be no hint
of the rest of the world.

09:32.298 --> 09:33.998
They need to feel

09:34.000 --> 09:35.232
like they are
completely alone.

09:35.234 --> 09:36.166
When they look
out the window,

09:36.168 --> 09:37.301
I want them to
see nothing

09:37.303 --> 09:38.636
but the dark woods,
the night sky

09:38.638 --> 09:39.637
and the mother(bleep)
blood moon.

09:39.639 --> 09:40.738
Okay, you're right.

09:40.740 --> 09:41.705
I get it.
Great.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.541
You need to see this.

09:43.543 --> 09:46.043
I need to see this.

09:48.881 --> 09:51.248
It's just right here
behind the tree.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.584
There.

09:56.055 --> 09:57.388
Ugh.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.822
(exhales)

09:58.824 --> 10:00.891
(coughs)

10:02.161 --> 10:04.194
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?

10:04.196 --> 10:05.262
Get over here.

10:05.264 --> 10:07.531
Get this, get this.

10:07.533 --> 10:08.766
Alissa, is this us?

10:08.768 --> 10:10.267
Uh-uh.

10:10.269 --> 10:11.902
DIANA:
Who would do something
like this?!

10:11.904 --> 10:13.604
SIDNEY:
What are those, fetal pigs?

10:13.606 --> 10:15.839
DIANA:
Uh, maybe-maybe it was
those Polk people.

10:15.841 --> 10:17.541
SIDNEY:
No, nobody's seen
the Polks for weeks.

10:17.543 --> 10:18.842
Trust me, we've looked.

10:18.844 --> 10:20.844
No, those hillbillies
are in the wind.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.079
Well, if it wasn't
the Polks,

10:22.081 --> 10:23.914
then who the (bleep) was it?

10:30.289 --> 10:34.124
Hello.
I'm Agnes Mary Winstead,

10:34.126 --> 10:35.960
and I played the part
of The Butcher

10:35.962 --> 10:38.195
in<i> My Roanoke Nightmare.</i>

10:38.197 --> 10:39.763
Hi, Agnes.
Hi.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.032
Please, give the viewers
a taste

10:42.034 --> 10:43.300
of what life's
been like for you

10:43.302 --> 10:45.135
since the show became
a smash hit.

10:45.137 --> 10:47.237
Well, it's been a wild ride.

10:47.239 --> 10:50.908
But first I want to thank
everybody behind the scenes,

10:50.910 --> 10:52.209
because, I mean--

10:52.211 --> 10:53.377
Well, it's been a team effort.

10:53.379 --> 10:54.712
You know?

10:54.714 --> 10:56.614
The Butcher--
(smacks lips)

10:56.616 --> 10:58.616
she's the role of a lifetime.

10:58.618 --> 11:01.986
And I felt a connection
with her

11:01.988 --> 11:05.623
from the very first moment
that I booked the audition.

11:05.625 --> 11:09.660
I am the queen
of every hive.

11:09.662 --> 11:12.830
I am the shield
over every head.

11:12.832 --> 11:14.898
(shouting):
I am the spear of battle!

11:14.900 --> 11:16.900
Who but I am both the tree

11:16.902 --> 11:20.070
and the lightning
that strikes it.

11:22.274 --> 11:23.440
Want me to do it again?

11:23.442 --> 11:25.275
I mean, I can
make it grittier,

11:25.277 --> 11:27.111
more vulnerable.

11:27.113 --> 11:29.246
I mean, I just--
I really love this part.

11:29.248 --> 11:31.582
It's a great part.

11:31.584 --> 11:34.485
Your nuanced portrayal
garnered rave reviews

11:34.487 --> 11:36.120
all around.

11:36.122 --> 11:37.187
You were even nominated
for a Saturn Award.

11:37.189 --> 11:38.489
I know. Yay.

11:38.491 --> 11:40.290
You were a huge
fan favorite.

11:40.292 --> 11:42.459
You were the villain
America loved to hate.

11:42.461 --> 11:45.095
But I-- I don't see her
as a villain.
Ah.

11:45.097 --> 11:46.630
You know, you see,
because it's my job

11:46.632 --> 11:50.200
as an actress to...
to create a real human being.

11:50.202 --> 11:53.470
She has desires,
she has weaknesses,

11:53.472 --> 11:55.172
just like you and me.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.141
And it was a privilege to...

11:57.143 --> 11:59.209
to breathe life into

11:59.211 --> 12:01.311
a real historical figure.

12:01.313 --> 12:03.514
I mean, whom, frankly,

12:03.516 --> 12:06.150
the patriarchy has just
swept aside.

12:06.152 --> 12:09.787
I felt a deep responsibility
to get it right.

12:09.789 --> 12:12.456
Well, I think it's obvious
that you really connected

12:12.458 --> 12:14.058
with this part.

12:14.060 --> 12:17.361
But it took a bit of a toll
as well, didn't it?

12:17.363 --> 12:20.064
Every part, every part,
you know,

12:20.066 --> 12:22.166
takes its pound of flesh.
Mm.

12:22.168 --> 12:25.736
But The Butcher was extremely,

12:25.738 --> 12:28.505
extremely taxing to play.

12:28.507 --> 12:33.210
And in my mind,
there are only two great roles

12:33.212 --> 12:35.045
in the American canon.

12:35.047 --> 12:39.683
It's Mary Tyrone
in<i> Long Day's Journey,</i>

12:39.685 --> 12:41.819
and The Butcher.

12:43.189 --> 12:45.189
Mm.

12:45.191 --> 12:48.092
Agnes, I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

12:48.094 --> 12:50.561
Can we talk
about Hollywood?

12:50.563 --> 12:52.229
WOMAN:
Say "Pikachu!"

12:52.231 --> 12:54.264
Get out of my way!

12:54.266 --> 12:56.266
Get out of my way!

12:56.268 --> 13:00.871
This is my land!
This is my land!

13:00.873 --> 13:02.272
Everybody knows that
you were charged

13:02.274 --> 13:03.841
with assault
with a deadly weapon

13:03.843 --> 13:07.277
and sentenced to six months
in a mental health facility.

13:07.279 --> 13:08.412
I would like to
give you the chance

13:08.414 --> 13:10.080
to set the record straight.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.415
What happened that day?

13:11.417 --> 13:14.585
You know, it was an incident.
It-it just...

13:14.587 --> 13:16.420
Breakdown?

13:18.424 --> 13:21.291
I-it-it was a one-time thing,

13:21.293 --> 13:23.794
and, uh,
I'm much better now.

13:23.796 --> 13:25.596
I mean, thanks to the-the...

13:25.598 --> 13:27.097
the great counselors
at Holly Hill.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.932
Well, this was more
than a one-time thing.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.435
You were diagnosed
with schizoaffective disorder.

13:31.437 --> 13:34.238
I think it's fair to say
that you became obsessed.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.774
You stole props
from the shoot.

13:36.776 --> 13:38.809
Costumes...
That's my action figure,
that's...

13:38.811 --> 13:41.278
I mean, you even moved
your entire life out here

13:41.280 --> 13:43.147
to North Carolina,
a few miles away

13:43.149 --> 13:45.082
from where we shot the show.

13:45.084 --> 13:46.383
Well, look, I'll be honest,

13:46.385 --> 13:49.253
this was a difficult time
for me.

13:49.255 --> 13:53.423
You know, I-I...
I dove too deep into the part.

13:53.425 --> 13:54.758
But I got help.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.593
My meds are
completely regulated,

13:56.595 --> 14:00.798
and I'm excited to start
the new season.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
So, you know...

14:02.802 --> 14:05.335
I see.
So you're fine now.

14:06.238 --> 14:08.105
How do you explain this?

14:08.107 --> 14:10.274
What is that?

14:10.276 --> 14:13.310
What was it,
a present from The Butcher?

14:16.282 --> 14:18.182
I didn't... I didn't do this.

14:18.184 --> 14:20.450
I'm really here to make sure
that this is documented

14:20.452 --> 14:23.020
on camera. Officer?

14:23.022 --> 14:24.688
(door opens)

14:26.158 --> 14:28.458
Sidney,
you have to believe me.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.461
I'm-I'm... I'm okay now.

14:31.463 --> 14:33.764
I... This isn't...
You can call my doctors...

14:33.766 --> 14:36.433
Agnes Mary Winstead,
you've been served.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.802
We've taking out a restraining
order against you.

14:38.804 --> 14:41.071
You are not allowed within
500 feet of the production.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.374
But how am I supposed
to do the show

14:44.376 --> 14:47.044
if I can't be
within 500 feet of--

14:47.046 --> 14:49.012
You're not on the show.
You're never gonna be

14:49.014 --> 14:50.347
on the show again.

14:51.617 --> 14:54.885
But... you need me.

14:54.887 --> 14:57.821
You can't do<i> Roanoke </i>
without The Butcher.

14:57.823 --> 14:59.723
The Butcher is not real.

14:59.725 --> 15:02.192
We only want
real people this year.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.628
I'm a real person.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.196
You are unstable.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.798
Stay away from the set, Agnes,

15:07.800 --> 15:10.067
or I will have you arrested.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.908
(door opens, closes)

15:21.180 --> 15:24.248
AGNES (shouting):
Vile, wretched bastards!

15:24.250 --> 15:27.484
Thou dare
cast me out of paradise?

15:27.486 --> 15:29.887
I am The Butcher...

15:29.889 --> 15:30.988
Don't turn around.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.756
Jesus, she's
completely insane.

15:32.758 --> 15:34.091
You really think
that a restraining order's

15:34.093 --> 15:35.092
gonna keep her away?

15:35.094 --> 15:36.326
God, I hope not.

15:36.328 --> 15:38.996
AGNES:
For I am The Butcher!

15:38.998 --> 15:41.765
I shall smite thee,

15:41.767 --> 15:43.567
limb from limb,

15:43.569 --> 15:47.070
the way a falcon tears
a rabbit!

15:57.917 --> 15:59.549
We have the pleasure
to sit down with Lee Harris,

15:59.551 --> 16:00.951
of<i> My Roanoke Nightmare</i> fame,

16:00.953 --> 16:03.220
to talk about rumors
of another installment

16:03.222 --> 16:05.455
of the surprise hit
of last season.

16:05.457 --> 16:07.357
Yes, there will be
a second season

16:07.359 --> 16:09.259
called<i> Return to Roanoke.</i>

16:09.261 --> 16:11.795
And I can confirm that
I've signed on the dotted line

16:11.797 --> 16:13.063
to be on the show.

16:13.065 --> 16:14.398
There's a lot
of speculation

16:14.400 --> 16:16.233
about the reasons
you've agreed

16:16.235 --> 16:17.401
to do the second season.

16:17.403 --> 16:19.102
It's simple.
I'm not gonna have them

16:19.104 --> 16:20.871
drag my name through the mud

16:20.873 --> 16:22.372
without being there
to defend myself.

16:22.374 --> 16:24.074
You're aware
there's a petition online

16:24.076 --> 16:26.243
to have you indicted
for murder?

16:26.245 --> 16:27.277
Yes.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.713
sIt's ridiculous and hurtful.

16:29.715 --> 16:31.214
My mother-in-law
is suing me

16:31.216 --> 16:33.984
to gain custody
of my daughter, Flora.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.819
That's the real
Roanoke nightmare.

16:35.821 --> 16:38.088
But you admit that
you've benefited financially.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.090
You've received
a seven-figure book--

16:40.092 --> 16:43.593
I'm a single mother working
to better my family's situation.

16:43.595 --> 16:45.762
Is that so hard
to understand?

16:45.764 --> 16:48.332
My question is,
knowing what I know,

16:48.334 --> 16:52.269
we put Lee on the show,
are we in any way liable?

16:52.271 --> 16:53.403
What if she kills again?

16:53.405 --> 16:55.172
Legally,
you're on solid ground.

16:55.174 --> 16:56.673
We've got an airtight
release of liability

16:56.675 --> 16:58.775
on the contract
everybody signed.

16:58.777 --> 17:00.243
There's no way the court
can hold you accountable.

17:00.245 --> 17:03.146
I'm less concerned
with Lee Harris,

17:03.148 --> 17:05.315
and more concerned
with the actress who played her,

17:05.317 --> 17:07.117
Monet...
Tumusiime.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.285
Tumusiime.

17:08.287 --> 17:10.153
Her representatives
have advised us

17:10.155 --> 17:12.289
that she has been
in and out of treatment

17:12.291 --> 17:13.123
for alcoholism.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.092
So that means
that the network

17:15.094 --> 17:16.593
and production cannot

17:16.595 --> 17:18.662
knowingly provide
alcohol to her.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.364
That could conceivably
make us liable.

17:20.366 --> 17:24.267
Okay... alcohol is
the secret sauce

17:24.269 --> 17:25.335
to reality shows.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.138
The key word here
is "knowingly."

17:28.140 --> 17:30.474
If she's a real
alcoholic,

17:30.476 --> 17:32.109
she's gonna find a drink
on her own.

17:32.111 --> 17:33.276
Let me get this straight.

17:33.278 --> 17:34.144
We would get
in more trouble

17:34.146 --> 17:35.679
for slipping a drink
to Monet

17:35.681 --> 17:37.881
than if Lee actually
murdered somebody?

17:37.883 --> 17:39.683
Yes.
Just to be safe,

17:39.685 --> 17:42.152
you might want to double that
liability insurance we have

17:42.154 --> 17:44.054
to just protect
ourselves.
You got it.

17:44.056 --> 17:46.957
Uh, we've got a major
problem on the set.
Okay.

17:50.462 --> 17:52.129
(brakes squeal)

18:00.372 --> 18:02.472
Jesus Christ.

18:03.575 --> 18:06.543
Alissa, Alissa,
what happened?

18:06.545 --> 18:08.645
(whispers)
Shit.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.854
MACK (on screen): See, if you
mount the wide-angle here,

18:17.856 --> 18:19.222
you'll not only get
the east side of the house,

18:19.224 --> 18:21.525
but a nice wide
of the hot tub.

18:21.527 --> 18:24.227
Yeah.
(screaming)

18:24.229 --> 18:26.430
(man's screams continue)

18:26.432 --> 18:28.565
(screaming)

18:28.567 --> 18:31.368
Greg!
Shit!

18:31.370 --> 18:33.437
You the union rep?
Yeah.

18:33.439 --> 18:35.205
What's protocol?
Are you shutting us down?

18:35.207 --> 18:37.574
Because, clearly,
this was an accident.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.176
Even in an accident,
we usually like to

18:39.178 --> 18:40.444
give the crew
a day or so

18:40.446 --> 18:43.246
to recover
from stuff like this.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.248
But it's your call.
Great.

18:49.288 --> 18:52.122
What time does
the cast get here?

18:52.124 --> 18:55.258
Oh, I-- Planes start
landing in four hours.

18:57.863 --> 18:58.929
We're gonna keep going.

18:58.931 --> 19:01.264
You can't be serious.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.468
Sid, Sid, someone
just died.

19:04.470 --> 19:07.270
It was a horrific accident,
but shit happens!

19:07.272 --> 19:09.072
"Shit happens"?

19:09.074 --> 19:10.907
That's what you have
to say?

19:10.909 --> 19:11.908
You saw that video.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.477
That wasn't just random.

19:13.479 --> 19:15.312
Yeah, I know, I saw it.
It was traumatic.

19:15.314 --> 19:17.080
No, you aren't
listening to me!
Shh! Listen.

19:17.082 --> 19:19.716
Get off!
Do you even<i> care</i>

19:19.718 --> 19:21.918
that we just lost
a crew member?
Do I--

19:21.920 --> 19:25.255
Something terrifying is
happening with this place.
D...

19:25.257 --> 19:27.424
Okay, I assure you, okay,
I am upset, too.

19:27.426 --> 19:31.128
But we have come too far to end
this before it even starts.

19:31.130 --> 19:34.231
Okay, you're letting your
imagination cloud your judgment.

19:34.233 --> 19:36.066
(scoffs)

19:36.068 --> 19:38.268
Take a breath.
You know what?

19:38.270 --> 19:40.403
I'm done.
Diana-- D, come on.

19:40.405 --> 19:42.672
Seriously.
No, (bleep) you, Sidney.

19:42.674 --> 19:45.075
Like, you might think
everything's fine,

19:45.077 --> 19:46.476
but I'm not spending
one more second

19:46.478 --> 19:48.512
in this goddamn place.

19:48.514 --> 19:49.946
You're really
doing this right now?

19:49.948 --> 19:53.150
D, come on.
You are<i> so</i> overreacting.

19:53.152 --> 19:54.985
(engine revs)

20:02.294 --> 20:03.193
Did you get that?

20:03.195 --> 20:05.162
(beep)

20:05.164 --> 20:07.464
It's 2:15
on Wednesday, the 12th,

20:07.466 --> 20:09.633
and this video will
serve as evidence

20:09.635 --> 20:12.202
of what really went down
on set today.

20:12.204 --> 20:15.105
'Cause I know Sidney's gonna
make me look like a crazy bitch.

20:15.107 --> 20:18.175
But too much creepy shit
has been happening

20:18.177 --> 20:22.279
for me not to say anything.

20:22.281 --> 20:25.315
God, Sid--
Sid may not see it,

20:25.317 --> 20:27.484
but I know something freaky
is happening at that place.

20:27.486 --> 20:30.120
And you know, I would rather
look like a crazy bitch

20:30.122 --> 20:32.656
than get killed
trying to make this show.

20:32.658 --> 20:35.058
(tires screech)

20:35.060 --> 20:37.227
(brakes squeal)

20:37.229 --> 20:38.728
What the (bleep)?

20:43.869 --> 20:47.237
I have no intention
of finding out who that is.

20:47.239 --> 20:49.472
Oh, God.
This place gives me the creeps.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.144
(screams, crashes)

21:13.065 --> 21:15.332
Hello.
(chuckles)

21:15.334 --> 21:17.367
Hello, I'm Audrey Tindall,

21:17.369 --> 21:20.337
no relation to the Tindalls
of the Princess Royal,

21:20.339 --> 21:22.205
unfortunately.

21:22.207 --> 21:26.042
And this is my first
confessional.

21:26.044 --> 21:28.612
You know me
as the reenactor playing

21:28.614 --> 21:30.413
the role of Shelby

21:30.415 --> 21:33.683
on<i> My Roanoke Nightmare.</i>

21:33.685 --> 21:36.953
And I know a lot of fans
are always really surprised

21:36.955 --> 21:38.455
when they first hear me speak,

21:38.457 --> 21:41.224
because I have
an English accent.

21:41.226 --> 21:44.561
MATT: Where are you taking us?
Safety.

21:44.563 --> 21:46.563
Where do these tunnels lead?

21:46.565 --> 21:48.098
I thought the
hillbillies built them.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.566
I built them.
Oh!

21:49.568 --> 21:51.101
Oh!
Oh!

21:51.103 --> 21:52.936
You okay?
Oh, God, that really hurt.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.138
Can we get some lights
in here, please?

21:55.140 --> 21:56.139
Cut!
A medic!
Oh, God!

21:56.141 --> 21:57.307
RORY (chuckling):
Yeah. Medic.

21:57.309 --> 21:59.209
AUDREY: Lord.
RORY: You all right?

21:59.211 --> 22:01.111
Yes, I'm fine.
Okay, back to one everybody!

22:01.113 --> 22:03.413
AUDREY: It's just so
bloody dark in here.
I know.

22:03.415 --> 22:06.082
I made the mistake of looking
right into the flame, and then,

22:06.084 --> 22:07.617
you know, the rest of
the world went dark.
(laughs)

22:07.619 --> 22:10.253
Oh, that's funny to you?
It's just your accent.

22:10.255 --> 22:12.155
Mm.
It's hilarious.
I l-love listening to it.

22:12.157 --> 22:14.057
I could listen to it all day.
Oh, really?

22:14.059 --> 22:16.626
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you... hey, um...

22:16.628 --> 22:18.628
Would you, actually,
think about ever

22:18.630 --> 22:20.997
having dinner with me, maybe?
(chuckles)

22:20.999 --> 22:22.332
With you?
Yeah.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.167
Um...
Just a light bite or
something... coffee.

22:24.169 --> 22:25.835
Coffee, anything.
I just... what, just so you can

22:25.837 --> 22:27.237
hear me speak?
Well, yeah...

22:27.239 --> 22:29.639
Maybe a little more than that.
(laughing): Okay.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.808
(laughs)
Right, are we ready?

22:31.810 --> 22:35.278
So, I have a bit of news
to share...

22:35.280 --> 22:37.180
(bad Cockney accent):
Hello, I'm Rory Monahan.

22:37.182 --> 22:40.617
I'm an... also an ex-Brit actor
on<i> My Roanoke Nightmare.</i>

22:40.619 --> 22:43.253
Oh, darling, this is
supposed to be private.

22:43.255 --> 22:45.355
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just
a lovely little chimney sweep!

22:45.357 --> 22:47.824
No! Absolutely not.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.426
That's terrible.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

22:49.428 --> 22:50.660
I really don't.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.929
Suck it, (bleep)!
We're hitched.

22:52.931 --> 22:54.698
Hey!
(laughs)

22:54.700 --> 22:56.866
Mm.

23:00.772 --> 23:03.707
Whoo! Yeah!

23:03.709 --> 23:05.141
(chuckles)

23:05.143 --> 23:09.546
Well, he is a whirlwind,
that one. Isn't he?

23:09.548 --> 23:12.048
Who could have guessed
that a woman of a certain age

23:12.050 --> 23:16.686
could have landed
such a handsome young stud?

23:16.688 --> 23:20.056
MAN: At this time, Audrey
and Rory would like to

23:20.058 --> 23:23.793
share their vows of love.

23:23.795 --> 23:26.730
AUDREY:<i> Rory, darling. Love has</i>
<i> always been a mystery to me.</i>

23:26.732 --> 23:28.998
<i> Like a tune whistling</i>

23:29.000 --> 23:31.668
<i> through the air.</i>
<i> I could hear snatches of it.</i>

23:31.670 --> 23:35.972
<i> Be moved by its melody,</i>
<i> but it always eluded my grasp.</i>

23:35.974 --> 23:38.508
But you heard my voice
and I heard yours.

23:38.510 --> 23:42.078
<i> For all you have given me,</i>
<i> I make these vows.</i>

23:42.080 --> 23:44.414
I promise to love you loyally

23:44.416 --> 23:46.149
and fiercely,

23:46.151 --> 23:48.318
for as long as I shall live.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.053
RORY:
<i> Audrey,</i>

23:50.055 --> 23:51.888
<i> you are red and blue.</i>

23:51.890 --> 23:54.357
<i> You are the color of the sun.</i>

23:54.359 --> 23:55.859
(laughs)
So bright,

23:55.861 --> 23:58.061
and hot!

23:58.063 --> 23:59.262
(laughter)
So hot!

23:59.264 --> 24:01.264
Sorry, Mom.

24:01.266 --> 24:05.235
<i> I promise to eternally,</i>
<i> forever,</i>

24:05.237 --> 24:07.170
love the shit out of you.
(laughs)

24:10.542 --> 24:12.409
(Audrey gasps)

24:12.411 --> 24:14.244
Yeah!
Ooh!

24:14.246 --> 24:18.114
AUDREY: First ones here,
best room.
(Rory beatboxing)

24:18.116 --> 24:20.183
Oh, this is where

24:20.185 --> 24:22.952
I had my first
on-camera love scene.

24:22.954 --> 24:24.354
And second.

24:24.356 --> 24:25.922
(giggling)
And third.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.357
And fourth.
Mm.
(phone buzzing)

24:27.359 --> 24:31.027
And... phone.
Phone...

24:33.532 --> 24:35.131
Who is it?
Herro?

24:35.133 --> 24:36.566
(gasps)

24:36.568 --> 24:39.235
No...

24:39.237 --> 24:41.638
Hang on, hang on.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.874
They want me to go back to L.A.
and do a screen test.

24:44.876 --> 24:47.977
(chuckling):
Oh, my God!
Oh!

24:47.979 --> 24:50.213
Rory, you...
you can't do that.

24:50.215 --> 24:52.449
You're contracted to be here
for the duration of the show.

24:52.451 --> 24:53.650
Babe. Who's more important?

24:53.652 --> 24:55.218
Sidney Aaron James, or...

24:55.220 --> 24:56.386
Brad Pitt?

24:56.388 --> 24:58.822
I'm not at all concerned that...

24:58.824 --> 25:02.091
he'll be, for six months,
on some distant location.

25:02.093 --> 25:05.228
We trust each other, implicitly.

25:09.234 --> 25:10.600
Sidney will be here in a minute.

25:10.602 --> 25:12.602
You just explain to him
why you have to leave.

25:12.604 --> 25:14.504
RORY: Don't say anything, okay?
(chuckles)

25:14.506 --> 25:15.905
I'll have my agent handle...

25:15.907 --> 25:17.607
You will...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:17.609 --> 25:18.675
Did you see that?

25:18.677 --> 25:20.243
I didn't see anything, no.

25:20.245 --> 25:22.111
On the other side
of the window.

25:22.113 --> 25:24.147
Sweetheart, don't
change the subject!

25:24.149 --> 25:25.281
Really!
No, no, no,
there was a shadow.

25:25.283 --> 25:27.750
AUDREY:
You have to tell him.

25:27.752 --> 25:30.520
(they both scream)
AUDREY: Oh, my God!

25:30.522 --> 25:31.754
Was that Agnes?
Yes!

25:31.756 --> 25:33.656
Oh, my God.
Bloody Hell!

25:33.658 --> 25:34.858
RORY:
Shit!

25:34.860 --> 25:36.860
(yells)

25:36.862 --> 25:38.161
H-Hey!
RORY: Did you do this?

25:38.163 --> 25:39.162
What?

25:39.164 --> 25:40.530
Agnes is here!
No...
Yes! She was...

25:40.532 --> 25:43.166
Yes! What the (bleep)!
Agnes is here.

25:47.038 --> 25:49.873
She was torturing me. I mean,
I won't go through this again.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.808
I really won't.
She's really that crazy?

25:51.810 --> 25:54.811
I-I mean, I heard
about the Hollywood...
Yes,

25:54.813 --> 25:56.279
she's totally mental.

25:56.281 --> 25:58.515
Absolutely crackers.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.750
(Agnes shouting, banging)

26:13.331 --> 26:15.865
(banging, crashing)

26:18.203 --> 26:20.036
SIDNEY:
We've searched the grounds,

26:20.038 --> 26:22.372
and there is no sign
of Agnes anywhere.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.974
If she shows up again, we will
get the police involved.

26:24.976 --> 26:26.209
I promise you.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.745
I don't want to stay here.
It's okay.

26:28.747 --> 26:32.081
I really don't.
She's gone, baby. She's gone.
You're safe now.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.917
She could terrify me.

26:33.919 --> 26:36.052
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
I'm serious.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.187
Hey. You two.

26:38.189 --> 26:40.590
I-I wanted to say
congratulations.

26:40.592 --> 26:43.826
It's... it's nice to see
that something good

26:43.828 --> 26:47.163
actually came out of this show.
Some cosmic balance in play.

26:47.165 --> 26:49.065
I... lost a husband,

26:49.067 --> 26:51.167
but you gained one.

26:51.169 --> 26:53.836
MONET: Hear, hear.
It's never too late

26:53.838 --> 26:55.738
for love.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.273
"Too late"?

26:58.076 --> 27:00.410
What do you mean?

27:00.412 --> 27:04.080
When is it "too late"?
When your heart ossifies?

27:04.082 --> 27:07.050
When your vagina exsiccates
No, I mean...

27:07.052 --> 27:09.218
All right.
into an
ancient artifact?
I was...

27:09.220 --> 27:12.388
Or is it just any woman
over the age of 29?

27:12.390 --> 27:14.123
What<i> do</i> you mean?
I was...

27:14.125 --> 27:17.060
I was talking about...
I was talking... about myself.

27:17.062 --> 27:19.028
(door opens)

27:19.030 --> 27:20.363
MONET:
Hey!

27:20.365 --> 27:23.900
SIDNEY:
Hi, guys! Come on in.

27:23.902 --> 27:25.768
The party's hoppin'.

27:30.709 --> 27:33.042
MONET: I don't get this.
You're taking our phones

27:33.044 --> 27:34.243
and giving us phones?

27:34.245 --> 27:35.411
Well, these phones
have been disabled.

27:35.413 --> 27:36.779
Only the camera works.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.581
We want you to help
document life

27:38.583 --> 27:39.916
in the house
for the next three days.

27:39.918 --> 27:41.484
Really put yourself
in the audience's

27:41.486 --> 27:42.986
point of view.

27:42.988 --> 27:45.722
As you all know, America fell in
love with two Shelbys,

27:45.724 --> 27:48.091
two Matts and two Lees.

27:48.093 --> 27:50.393
And Edward!
And Ed... How could I forget?

27:50.395 --> 27:51.961
(laughter)
SIDNEY: And we brought you
back together

27:51.963 --> 27:54.263
to see if magic
will strike a second time.

27:54.265 --> 27:56.232
Just do you.

27:56.234 --> 27:57.800
It's what America wants to see.

27:57.802 --> 28:00.236
And if something happens
to go bump in the night,

28:00.238 --> 28:01.337
let's be sure and capture it.

28:01.339 --> 28:02.772
One last thing before
I leave you to it.

28:02.774 --> 28:04.107
Lee, we're gonna put you
upstairs in your old room

28:04.109 --> 28:07.644
with Monet. Matt,
you're gonna be with Shelby.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.946
Uh, wait...
Wait, that's not gonna work.

28:09.948 --> 28:12.081
I could take the basement.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.082
Well, the whole house
is camera ready

28:13.084 --> 28:14.517
so sleep wherever you want.

28:14.519 --> 28:17.253
Hey, Matt, maybe we can talk
about this later.

28:17.255 --> 28:20.189
LEE: Shelby,
leave him be.
You have every right to be upset

28:20.191 --> 28:22.091
I deserve it...
My brother doesn't need
your permission to be upset.

28:22.093 --> 28:24.127
He's been doing
just fine without you.

28:24.129 --> 28:25.662
All right, Lee, that's enough.
LEE: He's too nice

28:25.664 --> 28:28.297
to say this, but you are a weak,
self-involved little girl

28:28.299 --> 28:30.099
who does whatever you want
without giving

28:30.101 --> 28:32.769
a damn about the carnage
you reap. You destroyed Matt

28:32.771 --> 28:34.303
but that wasn't enough.

28:34.305 --> 28:36.205
Thanks to your reckless
bullshit,

28:36.207 --> 28:38.675
everybody thinks I'm
a cold-blooded murderer.

28:38.677 --> 28:41.944
It was a goddamn mistake.
Jesus, I am so sick of you

28:41.946 --> 28:43.479
holding that over my head,
I don't... I don't know

28:43.481 --> 28:46.115
how many more ways I can
apologize to you. I'm done.

28:46.117 --> 28:47.650
I'm done being punished

28:47.652 --> 28:50.319
for being human. Matt,
it was one time, I swear to you.

28:50.321 --> 28:52.789
It was one time. I was lonely...
I was completely out of my mind.

28:52.791 --> 28:55.358
Just let me... I swear...

28:56.895 --> 28:59.128
Fiery and pathetic.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.464
That's exactly how I played her.

29:01.466 --> 29:03.166
Nailed it.
(laughs)
I completely...

29:03.168 --> 29:05.134
You know.

29:05.136 --> 29:06.803
Shh. Mm.
Oh.

29:06.805 --> 29:08.971
(Monet clears throat)

29:08.973 --> 29:10.873
(sniffles)

29:10.875 --> 29:12.742
Your room's upstairs, to the...

29:12.744 --> 29:15.244
Yeah. Thanks.
Good night.

29:15.246 --> 29:16.345
MONET:
<i> It didn't look like</i>

29:16.347 --> 29:18.147
they were playing
for the camera.

29:18.149 --> 29:20.049
I mean, she looked really upset.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.150
You thought so?

29:21.152 --> 29:23.219
I did. You didn't?

29:23.221 --> 29:25.188
I thought he was a little much.
Well...

29:25.190 --> 29:27.190
I think it's always better
to underplay these things,

29:27.192 --> 29:29.192
you know, if that's
where you're gonna go.

29:29.194 --> 29:32.195
Americans are always
so dramatic.

29:32.197 --> 29:34.163
Yeah, them tears
looked real.
(chuckles)

29:34.165 --> 29:36.099
AUDREY: I'll tell you
what isn't real.

29:36.101 --> 29:39.335
Their ridiculous story.
Obviously.
Ugh!

29:39.337 --> 29:42.572
Otherwise, why would they ever
set foot back in this house?

29:42.574 --> 29:44.774
We shot here
for eight weeks,
You got a point.

29:44.776 --> 29:46.876
nothing happened.
No ghost pilgrims,
Never.

29:46.878 --> 29:48.544
or people jerky.
(laughter)

29:48.546 --> 29:50.513
Hello.
Hey, bro.
Hey.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.283
MATT:
What, uh...

29:54.285 --> 29:56.552
What time of year was that?

29:56.554 --> 29:59.222
Summer?

29:59.224 --> 30:01.224
Yeah.
It was summer.
-ish?
Ah.

30:01.226 --> 30:03.760
Look out the window.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.027
(water running)

30:05.029 --> 30:06.195
Ooh!

30:06.197 --> 30:07.430
(chuckles softly)
Sorry!

30:07.432 --> 30:09.198
Here we go.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.566
(Audrey clears throat)

30:10.568 --> 30:12.602
(gasps)

30:12.604 --> 30:15.204
What're we looking at here?

30:15.206 --> 30:17.406
MONET (mocking):
A full moon?

30:17.408 --> 30:19.876
Nearly full.

30:19.878 --> 30:22.879
The blood moon is coming.

30:22.881 --> 30:24.814
Is that bad?

30:24.816 --> 30:26.616
(laughter)

30:26.618 --> 30:27.984
RORY:
Should we call somebody?

30:27.986 --> 30:30.319
(laughter continues)

30:55.446 --> 30:56.813
(Rory chuckling)
AUDREY: What are you doing?

30:56.815 --> 30:58.781
This is gonna be so hot.

30:58.783 --> 31:00.082
Darling.

31:00.084 --> 31:01.884
(passionate moaning)

31:17.769 --> 31:20.336
(sighs)

31:21.206 --> 31:22.205
(glass clinks)

31:22.207 --> 31:23.706
(breathes into glass)

31:35.220 --> 31:36.886
(sighs)

32:06.184 --> 32:08.184
Come back.
I'm gonna take
a shower

32:08.186 --> 32:09.485
and I want you
to join me.

32:09.487 --> 32:10.987
I'll be in in two minutes.

32:10.989 --> 32:13.089
All right.
(Rory moans)

32:13.091 --> 32:14.523
I mean it,
hurry.

32:14.525 --> 32:16.158
Okay, I'm coming.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.171
(kitchen utensils clatter)

32:50.194 --> 32:52.795
(footsteps)

32:56.567 --> 32:58.067
This is ridiculous,
Matt.

32:58.069 --> 33:00.036
You don't want
to sleep down here.

33:00.038 --> 33:03.039
Just come upstairs,
talk to me.

33:04.075 --> 33:05.875
I won't let you
shut me out anymore.

33:05.877 --> 33:07.476
I'm...

33:07.478 --> 33:10.079
I am still your wife.

33:10.081 --> 33:12.114
(scoffs)

33:14.118 --> 33:15.918
You should not
have come back.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.287
You know what this place is,
you know what happens here.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.655
No, it's different
this time.

33:19.657 --> 33:22.825
There are more of us,
and Sidney's got...

33:22.827 --> 33:24.894
cameras all over the house.

33:24.896 --> 33:26.295
Nobody's gonna
let us get hurt.

33:27.665 --> 33:30.399
You're smarter
than that, Shelby.

33:30.401 --> 33:34.270
It will happen again.

33:34.272 --> 33:37.139
I don't know if we'll
survive this time.

33:38.109 --> 33:40.476
Oh...

33:57.095 --> 33:58.694
I wouldn't have guessed
you and I had

33:58.696 --> 34:01.030
anything in common.

34:01.032 --> 34:04.500
Gotta say, I never did
see the resemblance.

34:04.502 --> 34:08.170
I ain't got nothing
in common with you.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.774
I can smell the booze
from here.

34:11.776 --> 34:13.142
I'm not judging you.

34:13.144 --> 34:16.345
It's hard going
that road alone.

34:16.347 --> 34:20.049
Do you wanna talk
to someone about it?

34:20.051 --> 34:21.717
I'm a drunk
because of you,

34:21.719 --> 34:23.686
you murdering bitch!

34:23.688 --> 34:26.489
I had to live
in your head for months.

34:26.491 --> 34:29.058
I know how you think.

34:29.060 --> 34:31.227
But how you live
with yourself,

34:31.229 --> 34:33.896
killing the father
of your child, hmm?

34:33.898 --> 34:36.665
That's how you
played me.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.968
Those people on the street
who yell "murderer" at me,

34:38.970 --> 34:41.303
they're not seeing me.

34:41.305 --> 34:45.207
They're seeing the person
you chose to put on the screen.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.343
SHELBY:
<i> Let's leave.</i>

34:47.345 --> 34:50.246
Matt, you and me.
(sniffles)

34:50.248 --> 34:54.683
Right now, we can just--
we can walk out the door.

34:54.685 --> 34:56.652
Hey, I just want
to go home.

34:56.654 --> 34:59.588
(banging on door)

35:08.833 --> 35:12.334
Shelby, hey.

35:12.336 --> 35:14.470
Uh...

35:17.108 --> 35:20.443
Gotta say...

35:20.445 --> 35:23.012
it felt nice...

35:23.014 --> 35:25.347
to finally meet
Dominic in person.

35:25.349 --> 35:29.085
SHELBY: Matt, Matt!
Matt... Matt!

35:29.954 --> 35:34.723
(distant shouting)

35:34.725 --> 35:36.725
Matt...
Stop it!

35:36.727 --> 35:38.294
Stop it!

35:38.296 --> 35:40.429
(both women shouting)

35:42.033 --> 35:43.866
Matt...

35:43.868 --> 35:45.267
Hey, hang on...

35:45.269 --> 35:49.238
(overlapping shouting)

35:49.240 --> 35:53.242
You're good!
I mean...

35:53.244 --> 35:55.811
(panting)

35:55.813 --> 35:57.780
Welcome home, huh?

35:57.782 --> 36:00.216
Whew. Good.

36:00.218 --> 36:02.284
(bleep) you, Sidney!

36:02.286 --> 36:04.386
(bleep) you, mother(bleep)er!

36:17.502 --> 36:19.135
(hinges creaking)

36:23.107 --> 36:25.074
Rory?

36:52.036 --> 36:54.336
(glass squeaking)

36:56.040 --> 36:59.508
(screaming)

36:59.510 --> 37:01.143
(screaming continues)

37:01.145 --> 37:03.212
Babe?
AUDREY:
Oh, my God!

37:03.214 --> 37:04.713
What?
Oh, my God!

37:04.715 --> 37:06.815
What? Are you okay?
Oh, my God!

37:06.817 --> 37:09.485
You okay?
What happened? What happened?

37:09.487 --> 37:12.521
(bleep) Sidney!
What happened?

37:12.523 --> 37:14.290
He sent someone up
to scare me.

37:14.292 --> 37:16.959
He was just standing there
when I got out of the shower.

37:16.961 --> 37:18.627
(sobbing):
Oh, my God!

37:18.629 --> 37:20.696
Will you take care
of her?
Yes, of course.

37:20.698 --> 37:22.298
Please don't go up there.
Do not go.
That asshole!

37:24.168 --> 37:25.201
Hey, girl.
Hi, Dominic.

37:25.203 --> 37:27.036
When did you get here?

37:27.038 --> 37:29.205
You okay, baby?
You all right?

37:29.207 --> 37:31.807
He's the worst person ever.
Why would he do that?

38:07.445 --> 38:09.478
(bleep) you, Sidney!

38:10.615 --> 38:12.348
(gasps, grunts)

38:54.292 --> 38:57.259
Thank you.

38:57.261 --> 39:00.329
I can't believe Sidney would
pull some bullshit like this.

39:00.331 --> 39:01.930
Oh, please!

39:01.932 --> 39:03.098
He doesn't actually
believe

39:03.100 --> 39:05.501
any of this haunting
nonsense is real.

39:05.503 --> 39:08.103
No offense.

39:08.105 --> 39:10.139
"R"...

39:12.076 --> 39:13.309
...is for "Rory."
