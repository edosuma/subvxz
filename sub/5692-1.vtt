It doesn't serve me.

01:06.022 --> 01:09.112
DETECTIVE HAVEN [OS]:
What?

01:09.156 --> 01:16.293
GARRET:
My memory. I don't know what was
real and what I think I saw.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.121
DETECTIVE HAVEN:
I'm not sure that there's a
difference.

01:18.165 --> 01:21.994
ROSE:
You weren't there. You didn't
see what I saw.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.649

You're basing your information
off emotions.

Even if I am. He got there after
it happened.

01:26.956 --> 01:30.438
I don't think you're
understanding the situation.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.048

HAZEM:
As insensitive as it may sound,
it's not my problem.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.973
Look. I just need more time.

01:44.016 --> 01:47.672
More time? You realize what that
tells me?

01:47.716 --> 01:52.721
Did you see what happened out
there? I just need a minute!

01:52.764 --> 01:56.942
So take a minute.

01:56.986 --> 02:00.337
GARRET [VO]:
It's just hard to believe it all
comes down to skin color.

02:00.381 --> 02:03.775
I mean, we're an educated
society.

02:03.819 --> 02:07.866
It's 2008 for Christ's sake. It
just doesn't make any sense.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.913
ROBERT:
[over the phone]
It's politics Garret. Why the
hell would it make any sense?

02:10.955 --> 02:12.480
You know, it's not that simple.

02:12.523 --> 02:13.959

Well, it's not all that
complicated either.

It will be held on the first
Tuesday of October.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.708
Many volunteers are still

03:15.760 --> 03:17.327
this study just came out and it
shows that...

03:17.371 --> 03:20.591
students are aware that black
people exist, so thanks Britney.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.811

03:56.932 --> 03:58.281
Marison's never done shit
for us.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.022
So why are you knocking on that
door again?

04:00.065 --> 04:02.242
What do you think we should do?
What do you think we should do?

04:02.285 --> 04:03.808
I wanna do something
different!

04:03.852 --> 04:05.157
Like what Trey?

04:05.201 --> 04:07.203
Like go to the Cracka house
and kick some ass!

04:07.247 --> 04:08.204
KEVIN [OS]:
What's a cracka house?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.727
MALIK [OS]:
Kappa house man.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.076
And who says they have anything
to do with this anyway?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.774
You don't think any of those
punks...

04:12.817 --> 04:13.427
have anything to do with this?

04:13.470 --> 04:14.341
Not necessarily.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.472
- Bullshit Rose!
- Come on Rose.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.298
Mind your business Kevin.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.260
ALEXANDER:
Yo, we're not rushing
till next week...

05:04.304 --> 05:05.870
so you can come back then.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.395
Oh no, I'm not here to join
your little boy scouts club.

05:08.438 --> 05:12.834
Right. So why are you
here?

05:12.877 --> 05:14.705
I'm here because I was
walking to class today,

05:14.749 --> 05:20.842
and I saw a noose hanging from a
tree on my campus.

05:20.885 --> 05:24.846
Oh, I'm sorry, it's a little too
graphic?

05:24.889 --> 05:27.283
I was just wondering if you guys
had heard anything about that.

05:27.327 --> 05:32.767
Yo any of you guys hear about a
rope hanging from a tree?

05:32.810 --> 05:35.160
Alexander you hear about this?

05:35.204 --> 05:43.299
Sorry man. Wish I
could help.

05:43.343 --> 05:49.436
You think you're safe here with
your little Backstreet Boys?

05:49.479 --> 05:53.527
You will always have to answer
to somebody. Bitch.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.579
SAM:
Aw shit!

06:12.197 --> 06:13.721
KEVIN:
Take it easy guys.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.261
VALARIE:
A bit more slack.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.567
[cell phone beeps]

06:34.568 --> 06:36.004
A little bit more.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.527
Hazem, you're playing with
your phone again!

06:37.571 --> 06:38.833
HAZEM:
I'm not playing with
anything!

06:38.876 --> 06:46.971
You have my life in your
hands. More slack.

06:47.015 --> 06:53.369
A bit more slack. More.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.546
Sorry about that pumpkin. It's
my phone, you know?

06:56.590 --> 06:57.765
I'm going to kill you!

06:57.808 --> 06:59.636
Who's going to give you
more slack?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.811
Just put me down.

07:00.855 --> 07:04.641
HAZEM [OS]:
Okay.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.948
[LAUGHTER]

07:06.991 --> 07:08.384
VALERIE [OS]:
Why are you so stubborn?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.952
HAZEM [OS]:
Stop forcing me to do
something.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.083
VALERIE [OS]:
I'm just suggesting.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.563
HAZEM [OS]:
Okay fine, so suggest.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.651
The blue button down.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.000
Oh anything but the blue button
down.

07:16.044 --> 07:16.871
You gotta look nice.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.089
You don't think I look nice?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.308
I think you look nice

07:19.351 --> 07:20.918
But I want my parents to think
you look nice.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.790
And why would I care what your
parents think?

07:22.833 --> 07:23.834
Because they're your future
in-laws.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.357
My future what?

07:25.401 --> 07:26.881
You're going to meet my parents

07:26.924 --> 07:28.491
and you're going to wear the
blue button down.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.449
I'll wear this shirt. How about
that?

07:29.492 --> 07:30.667
I don't like that shirt.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.234
You don't like this shirt. Are
you serious?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.454
Do you know what kind of
material this is?

07:34.497 --> 07:35.846
This is husband
material.

07:35.890 --> 07:36.543
Oh you're so-

07:36.586 --> 07:37.805
Hey Bobby! Tonight!

07:37.848 --> 07:39.589
BOBBY:
Tomorrow.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.243
- Tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow!

07:41.286 --> 07:44.246
Not tomorrow! Tonight. Just
later. Okay?

07:44.289 --> 07:48.163
Don't talk politics okay?
Especially not with my dad.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.513
Mmmm you think I'm going to
insult him or something?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.080
Oh let's see how do I say this?

07:52.123 --> 07:56.127
You're not exactly the best at
being politically correct.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.130
Well, we're not all poli-sci
majors are we?

07:59.174 --> 08:01.045
That's right. Dean's list baby.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.612
Yeah dean's list.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.875
Which reminds me, I'm taking you
next week to go register.

08:04.919 --> 08:09.010
Yeah, about that. No. I'm not
gonna vote, okay?

08:09.053 --> 08:10.446
We're just gonna register.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.493
I'm not gonna vote unless I get
the free ice cream.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.629
Okay. Convince
me.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.676
Okay. It is said that a weakened
sense of responsibility...

08:22.719 --> 08:25.592
does not actually weaken the
fact of responsibility.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.464
Okay...Huh?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.988
Are you seriously not voting?

08:31.032 --> 08:33.164
Look I just don't wanna watch
two rich guys debate

08:33.207 --> 08:35.253
and then jump on
a bandwagon.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.559
Smart people don't do
that.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.083
Oh Great. So when all the smart
people think like you...

08:40.128 --> 08:44.436
who does that leave to vote?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.351
You.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.528
I can't vote for all of us.

08:48.571 --> 08:52.532
Aw sure you can. Ow!

08:53.794 --> 08:56.144
GARRET:
Okay, you keep this in your
fridge to keep your food fresh.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.972

It makes things rise when
you bake.

08:58.015 --> 09:02.498
MEGAN:
Baking soda. Um, pure sodium
bi-carbonate. Na H CO3.

09:02.542 --> 09:07.068
Nice.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.548
Okay, this is an easy one.

09:08.591 --> 09:11.551
You use it to sweeten your
drinks. You put it in tea.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.292
Honey. But that's not a
compound. So--

09:14.336 --> 09:15.946
Honey? How old are you?

09:15.990 --> 09:17.339
That's what I put in my tea.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.124
Alright what does everyone else
in the world use?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.083

09:28.045 --> 09:31.527
Nice. Honey? Good Lord man!

09:31.571 --> 09:33.137
GARRET [OS]:
Oh, sorry that's
mine.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.574
Yo what is this?

09:34.617 --> 09:35.749
Are you competing for that?

09:35.792 --> 09:38.099
Uh, I'm not competing. I'm gonna
get it.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.928
That's awesome. That's a ton of
money.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.103
And if you win, you can always
use it to--

09:42.146 --> 09:44.801
Dude! Thirty thousand dollars?

09:44.845 --> 09:48.109
Please help yourself to the
middle of my sentence!

09:48.152 --> 09:50.067
Well you know my dad's been
looking for a job...

09:50.111 --> 09:52.809
for a couple of months and I
thought, you know,

09:52.853 --> 09:56.639
this might help him out a bit.
So, you know we'll see.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.467
That's awesome.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.731

CUSTOMER:

can get you another one.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.735
I can't accept any other payment
sir,

10:05.779 --> 10:07.781
I'm going to have to ask you
to step aside.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.087
Are you kidding me? I go to
school here.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.436
Man, just hold on a
second.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.308

stolen credit cards...

10:24.275 --> 10:27.365

place down the street, alright?

10:27.409 --> 10:29.324

10:52.042 --> 10:53.174
CASHIER [OS]:
Leave!
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.437
Jesus.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.619
GARRET:
Hey. What's up?

11:03.663 --> 11:07.101
ALEXANDER:
What's up? Fifteen pages on the
elasticity of macro-economics.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.711
We were supposed to meet in the
grad library.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.235
Dude. I am so sorry, you wanna
come in?

11:13.281 --> 11:15.239
ASSISTANT [OS]:
Miss Torrance? Thank you for
waiting.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.415
Dean Marison will see you
now.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.069
ROSE:
Thank you so much for meeting
with me Dean.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.418
I know that you're extremely
busy.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.856
DEAN:
Oh not at all. This is why I'm
here.

11:22.899 --> 11:26.250
Yes sir. Um, I guess the problem
now is that students are feeling

11:26.294 --> 11:28.818
offended by the events that
are happening on campus,

11:28.862 --> 11:30.211
especially the noose hanging

11:30.254 --> 11:33.388
Valerie. Make sure you get all
this.

11:33.431 --> 11:37.218
Listen miss Torrance, the
situation is bad.

11:37.261 --> 11:40.264
It's bad for the students. It's
bad for the university.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.613
It's bad for everyone.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.920
I want you to know that the
administration...

11:43.964 --> 11:47.054
and myself deeply
condemn these actions.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.620
I mean that's why we're here!

11:48.664 --> 11:52.059
To teach people and help them
grow out of their ignorance.

11:52.102 --> 11:55.715
That's the role we play as
educators.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.852
GARRET:
Okay what the hell does this
mean?

12:02.896 --> 12:06.073
"Obama's presidency would be the
camel's nose."

12:06.116 --> 12:07.378
ALEXANDER:
What are you reading?

12:07.422 --> 12:11.339
It's my homepage. It's the news
page.

12:11.382 --> 12:15.430
An old Arabian proverb
states if...

12:15.473 --> 12:17.475
the camels nose enters the
tent...

12:17.519 --> 12:19.477
his body will soon follow.

12:19.521 --> 12:22.742
I feel like I should be
offended by something here.

12:22.785 --> 12:23.917
What's her name?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.746
Buggle. Yo, watch it, she's
slippery.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.313
You know the French eat frogs
like this.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.881
Yeah?

12:31.925 --> 12:35.189
Oh yeah. Boiled frog legs.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.974
Miss Buggle would be a real
delicacy over there.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.151
Sounds gross. And painful.

12:41.195 --> 12:45.416
Some French cooks found that if
you put a frog in water,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.636
It'll just sit there and enjoy
the drink.

12:47.679 --> 12:51.335
But if you start slowly turning
up the heat,

12:51.379 --> 12:52.510
the frog will fall
asleep.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.425
Turn up the heat
a little more,

12:54.469 --> 12:56.819
it'll fall into a
deeper sleep.

12:56.863 --> 13:01.171
Eventually the water's boiling,
and Miss Buggle is dead.

13:01.215 --> 13:04.435
That's how you go from a
live frog to a meal.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.656
That's what they mean by the
camel's nose.

13:07.699 --> 13:11.878
They're wondering how this guy
whose ancestors came over...

13:11.921 --> 13:13.488
to this country chained up on a
boat...

13:13.531 --> 13:17.709
ends up running for
president.

13:17.753 --> 13:21.844
You gonna take that?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.760
No, that's fine.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.154
It's 8:30. Let's get started on
this paper.

13:28.372 --> 13:34.422
ROSE:
Dean. Off the record, are we
just going to let these guys go?

13:34.465 --> 13:39.383
DEAN:
Off the record, Rose, let who
go? We don't know who did this.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.645
Of course, we know who did this.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.387
You and I both know exactly who
did this.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.868
Are you suggesting the Kappa
House is responsible?

13:45.912 --> 13:46.826
So you do know.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
What I know, Rose,

13:48.392 --> 13:50.960
is that college students love
spreading rumors.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.354
ROSE [OS]:
These are not rumors
dean Marison.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.704
The Kappa House has a history of
racism...

13:55.747 --> 13:57.749
that everyone seems to
acknowledge except...

13:57.793 --> 13:59.316
this administration.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.364
As a results of recent tensions,
we have instated mandatory

14:03.407 --> 14:06.193
diversity training for all
campus organizations.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.803
And that is gonna do what
exactly?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.675
Valerie, would you please?

14:10.719 --> 14:12.373
VALERIE:
The administration cannot charge
a group of students...

14:12.416 --> 14:14.897
with a hate crime without
substantial evidence.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.507
Oh, she's good.

14:16.551 --> 14:20.294
Dean. This is a threat to every
black student on this campus.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.512
DEAN [OS]:
I can understand that,
Miss Torrance.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.079
ROSE [OS]:
No I don't think you
do.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.908
We're going to explore every
possible means by which we can

14:25.952 --> 14:28.868
find out what happened. We'll
set up a safe space--

14:28.911 --> 14:30.478
With all due respect dean.

14:30.521 --> 14:33.611
There is a noose hanging from a
tree in your safe space.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.483
We don't need to explore what
happened.

14:35.526 --> 14:40.270
You and I know exactly what
happened and who made it happen.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.098
We can't know anyone's intention
Rose.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.535
It's not fair to misjudge
people...

14:44.579 --> 14:47.756
just as you wouldn't like
to be misjudged.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.933
I would think someone like
yourself would understand that.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.283
Dean. Do you want me to keep
typing?

14:53.327 --> 14:57.113
No. Thank you for your time.

14:57.157 --> 15:04.120
Miss Torrance. I want to assure
you there is no need to worry.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.470
This is an isolated incident.

15:12.085 --> 15:17.394
[soulful music]

15:31.713 --> 15:36.283
TREY:
Hey what'd he say? Rose, come on
what'd he say?

15:38.024 --> 15:41.331
You okay?

15:41.375 --> 15:42.506
Rose!

15:42.550 --> 15:43.943
ROSE:
One minute Trey.

15:47.729 --> 15:50.210
[sobs]

16:38.736 --> 16:41.174
DIMON [OS]:
Take a break. Take a break

16:48.485 --> 16:51.358
DIMON:
Time! Alright, we're gonna...

16:51.401 --> 16:52.837
work our inside
counter-punch drill.

16:52.881 --> 16:53.882
HAZEM:
Alright.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.188
If I throw my left hook too
wide,

16:55.231 --> 16:57.146
you shoot it straight
right down the middle.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.541
Got it.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.369
Oh okay. Nice, nice.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.761
Yeah money!

17:03.805 --> 17:07.852
Okay, alright. Now, when you
feed that right hand,

17:07.896 --> 17:09.854
you better be ready to defend
yourself, alright?

17:09.897 --> 17:13.728
Alright.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.164
BOTH:
Keep your hands up!

17:15.208 --> 17:16.644
I let you have that man.

17:16.686 --> 17:18.166
Yeah right.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.213
So how come your girl don't come
see you fight no more?

17:20.256 --> 17:22.606
Because I don't wanna embarrass
you like this every time.

17:22.650 --> 17:26.045
I know you got this ego thing
going man.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.612
In the ring, I want you
to be confident, not cocky.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.050
Cocky will get you killed.
Alright?

17:31.093 --> 17:32.573
You need to watch some Rocky or
something,

17:32.616 --> 17:33.400
and learn how to
coach!

17:33.443 --> 17:34.096
Rocky?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.402
Yeah.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.099
Man you leave the coaching to
me. I got this.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.536
You be ready to practice this
weekend and bring your A-game.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.885
HZEM [OS]:
It's the only game I
got man!

17:40.929 --> 17:43.714
DIMON [OS]:
Man what'd I just
say?

17:52.245 --> 17:55.117
ROSE:
I can't believe you talked
me into this.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.815
MALIK:
It is cold and wet out
here.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.905
TREY:
Yo, don't even worry about
it. Let's go.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.212
It's beautiful though.

18:03.256 --> 18:11.481
Yeah, it is.

18:11.525 --> 18:12.830
Yeah! Hey pass it here.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.310
TREY [OS]:
Hell no dude you ain't
touching this.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.617
First we're trespassing now, you
have a weapon.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.053
What are you
doing?

18:18.097 --> 18:22.623
Yo, Relax. It's not a weapon.
It's a baseball bat.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.277
MALIK [OS]:
What are you going to do with a
bat and a football anyway?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.583
KEVIN:
You poor ignorant souls.

18:26.627 --> 18:27.758
Batter up!

18:27.802 --> 18:30.109
Swing batter, batter, batter!

18:30.152 --> 18:31.762
ROSE [OS]:
Oh my goodness!

18:31.806 --> 18:36.158
That one's outta here folks! Get
money, get paid baby.

18:42.730 --> 18:47.256
It's okay, you can smile.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.262
ROSE [VO]:
When all the doors are closed,

18:53.306 --> 18:57.701
when you feel like you're
carrying the world on your back,

18:57.745 --> 19:00.182
it's easy to forget that you're
just a kid.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.839
VALERIE:
You know I almost drowned as a
little kid?

19:04.882 --> 19:08.277
HAZEML
Drowned? So I almost never
met you huh?

19:08.321 --> 19:10.714
Yeah. I almost died.

19:10.758 --> 19:18.069
Wow. Well did your life flash
before your eyes like they say?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.985
Actually, when something goes
wrong,

19:21.029 --> 19:23.336
your brain usually deals with it
by...

19:23.379 --> 19:24.989
trying to find a similar
situation.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.732
So, when you touch something
hot, what do you do?

19:28.776 --> 19:29.559
Pull my hand away.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.126
Right!

19:31.170 --> 19:32.301
Because your brain knows if you
don't pull your hand away,

19:32.345 --> 19:33.520
you're gonna get hurt.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.261
This happens in your brain all
the time...

19:35.304 --> 19:36.827
without you realizing it.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.220
You making all this up?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.962
No, I'm not. That's the case
when you're dying.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.312
Your brain knows that something
is very, very wrong.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.922
But your brain has never died
before.

19:44.966 --> 19:47.098
So it frantically searches
through all your memories

19:47.142 --> 19:49.144
until it can find a similar
situation...

19:49.188 --> 19:50.276
and hopefully save
you.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.015
But it can't.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.756
So before you die,

19:52.800 --> 19:56.760
your life actually does flash
before your eyes.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.415
Mmm, I think we should see other
people.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.113
Ha-ha. They don't teach you that
in med school, do they?

20:02.157 --> 20:03.419
Not exactly.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
I wonder what I'd see flashing
before my eyes.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.944
I don't know...

20:06.988 --> 20:09.860
but I'd rather look at life with
a more positive outlook.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.340
Yeah? How's that?

20:11.384 --> 20:14.952
Well. we can build our future
home, for example.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.040
Hmmm, Okay.

20:16.084 --> 20:16.911
You wanted palm trees out front,
right?

20:16.954 --> 20:19.130
Oh look! I found us a pet.

20:21.785 --> 20:22.395
The hell is that?

20:22.438 --> 20:23.265
It's a starfish.

20:23.309 --> 20:23.961
Yeah I can see that.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.398
Feel its skin.

20:25.441 --> 20:25.963
I don't wanna feel its skin. Get
that away from me.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.356
No, see this!

20:27.400 --> 20:28.749
No seriously. Valerie, I'm not
kidding, I'm serious.

20:28.792 --> 20:29.924
What are you scared?

20:29.967 --> 20:31.273
I'm not scared, it's got these
suction--

20:31.317 --> 20:32.535
No feel it!

20:32.579 --> 20:33.710
Valerie I'm not playing anymore.
Quit playing.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.844
Alright fine. You wanna handle
this like men?

20:36.887 --> 20:38.149
You wanna take this outside?

20:38.193 --> 20:39.412
We are outside.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.674
Well then we're efficient people
aren't we?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.153
Yes, we are effecient people!

20:42.197 --> 20:43.242
Okay.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.852
Alright, come on! Put your hands
up.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.462
I'm too fast for you, actually.
I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.247
Float like a butterfly, sting
like a bee.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.987
I'm the pretty one in this
relationship, okay?

20:50.031 --> 20:52.294
Give me a break. Alright, give
me your left hook.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.470
This is my right hand. Here is a
left hook!

20:54.514 --> 20:56.211
Right hand?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.691
Fine! Give me a left hook! My
left!

20:57.734 --> 20:58.909
Whatever, my left!

20:59.214 --> 21:00.302
Okay, get ready.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.434
You can't punch me back!

21:01.477 --> 21:02.826
Why not?

21:02.870 --> 21:04.306
[giggles]

21:04.872 --> 21:06.961
You actually punched me!

21:07.004 --> 21:09.920

'cause you don't wanna get
punched!

This is my problem!

"Compton Cookout. Join us for a
Nigga Night."

black classmates,

21:57.228 --> 22:00.362
Ghetto chicks should have
gold teeth, start drama, and...

22:00.406 --> 22:02.016
wear cheap clothes. They look
and act like Shenaynay

22:02.059 --> 22:03.974
and speak loudly while rolling
their neck

22:04.018 --> 22:06.368
and waving their finger in your
face.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.023
The Kappa House is proud to
house this monstrosity

22:09.066 --> 22:10.590
so travel through the house

22:10.633 --> 22:12.896
and experience the various
elements of life in the ghetto.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.029
We'll be serving 40s, kegs
of dat purple drank,

22:15.072 --> 22:17.684
chicken, Kool-aid, and of course
watermelon.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.120
So come one, come
all.

22:19.163 --> 22:22.384
And join us for a party to be
remembered, or not."

22:22.428 --> 22:23.385
PLAYER 1 [OS]:
This is ridiculous.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.995
Can you believe this bullshit?

22:25.039 --> 22:27.389
Kappa House is off campus. They
can have any party they want.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.912
PLAYER 2 [OS]:
There's no way we can cancel it?

22:28.956 --> 22:29.783
TREY [OS]:
So we're just not going to do
anything?

22:31.306 --> 22:33.830
We're going.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.180
[group mutters in agreement]

22:46.277 --> 22:47.496
VALERIE:
What time is your fight
Saturday?

22:47.540 --> 22:48.584
HAZEM:
Six, I think.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.933
And you want me to come to this
one?

22:49.977 --> 22:50.717
Hell no.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.197
Fine, have it your way.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.025
I'll probably end up going to
that frat party then.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.071
Valerie why would you go to that
party?

22:57.114 --> 23:00.379
What, I can't handle going to a
party without you?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.381
It's messed up. It's a ghetto
themed party.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.034
No it's not. Where are you
getting this?

23:04.078 --> 23:05.427
Did you even see the fliers?

23:05.471 --> 23:08.778
What fliers? Okay never mind
let's just drop it.

23:08.822 --> 23:09.910
We need to get going anyway,

23:09.953 --> 23:13.000
my parents are waiting. 'Yalla
nimshy.'

23:15.481 --> 23:17.352
You know, when white girls try
to talk Arabic,

23:17.396 --> 23:20.442
usually it sounds pretty bad.
You though? it sucks.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.791
You are such a jerk!

23:21.835 --> 23:23.445
I know. You love me though,
right?

23:23.489 --> 23:24.403
Sure.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.274
Sure? I want you to say it.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.754
Yeah, I love you.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.366
Wow, I'm not convinced at all.
Say it and mean it!

23:31.410 --> 23:32.933
That's the best I got.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.501
Say it with some passion, like
it means something to you.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.980
No.

23:37.024 --> 23:37.981
Valerie, if you don't say it,
I'm gonna hurt myself.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.983
And how are you going to do
that?

23:40.027 --> 23:44.423
I'm gonna jump. And if I jump,
you're jumping with me.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.599
Oh, I would really like to see
that.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.426
You'd love to see me jump?

23:47.469 --> 23:48.427
Yeah.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.471
Last chance.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.907
Nope.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.953
My life's gonna flash before my
eyes. Last chance.

23:52.996 --> 23:53.823
Nope.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
Okay.

23:55.695 --> 23:56.391
Oh my Go-

23:56.435 --> 23:58.437
[doorbell rings]

23:58.480 --> 24:01.222
TIM:
Coming! Hello.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.266
Hey.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.311
VALERIE:
Hi.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.355
TIM:
The hell happened to you two?

24:04.399 --> 24:05.661
HAZEM:
There was a leak.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.011
There was a leak in the car?

24:08.055 --> 24:09.622
Yeah. Daddy this is Hazem.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.972
Good to finally meet you sir.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.104
Nice to meet you. Come on in.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.541
Thanks.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.586
This one will fit right into the
family photo album.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.718
Dad!

24:18.761 --> 24:19.675
Why don't you go upstairs,
Valerie,

24:19.719 --> 24:20.981
and get something dry to
wear.

24:21.024 --> 24:24.071
Maybe find something for
Khazem. Have a seat.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.639
Just don't sit on the sofa
please.

24:26.682 --> 24:32.601
So uh Khazem, that's an ethnic
name. isn't it?

24:32.645 --> 24:36.387
Uh, It depends on where you're
from I guess.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.519
Aren't you from the Middle East?

24:37.563 --> 24:41.175
I'm from Jersey. Hoboken.

24:41.218 --> 24:45.962
TIM [OS]:
You're from Jersey. Okay so...
Let's sit down somewhere.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.529
Maybe the dining room
table.

24:47.573 --> 24:48.225
Sure.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.531
So, uh...

24:49.575 --> 24:50.880
You have a beautiful home, by
the way.

24:50.924 --> 24:54.275
Thank you very much. I like to
keep it that way.

25:10.683 --> 25:14.556
SHEILA:
Oh my. Silence frightens
me.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.559
So Hazem, you haven't told us
what you've been studying.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.735
I'm a third year med student.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.476
3.8 GPA.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.001
Wow that's wonderful. Money is
always wonderful.

25:25.045 --> 25:28.178
That's why you're saying that
you hit the jackpot, Valerie?

25:28.222 --> 25:32.966
Dad! I never said that. I never
said that.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.315
TIM [OS]:
Well I'm saying it.

25:34.358 --> 25:37.405
So what's the medical field like
in your country?

25:37.448 --> 25:38.537
What happened?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.060
Valerie tells us you're from
Egypt.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.496
Egypt? You told me Jersey.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.063
His parents are from Egypt.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.891
Oh, so what? Are you going to
live in Egypt?

25:44.934 --> 25:48.503
No, Tim don't be silly. They're
staying right here of course.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.593
SHEILA [OS]:
Not that I don't like Egypt,
Hazem. .

25:51.637 --> 25:53.987
I've seen pictures of the
pyramids. Beautiful.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.728
What'd be so wrong with moving
to Egypt?

25:55.771 --> 25:57.338
I think it'd be exciting.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.646
But a person should live in the
best place they can afford.

26:00.689 --> 26:04.084
And you don't want to be around
all those diseases.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.651
That's frightening.

26:05.694 --> 26:09.045
Well, I think it's easy to judge
something from far away.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.308
Yeah, sure, but by the same
token,

26:11.352 --> 26:14.181
You wouldn't want to be living
in Compton, would you Kazem?

26:14.224 --> 26:16.705
Tim, you're being silly.
Compton.

26:16.749 --> 26:19.229
All those baggy pants and guns.

26:19.273 --> 26:22.058
You know just the sight of
guns--

26:22.102 --> 26:24.931
Frightens you. No, me too. I
agree.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.629
Dad, you grew up in Detroit
right?

26:27.673 --> 26:29.413
Warren. Yeah, a little city
called Warren.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.980
Yeah? What was that like?

26:31.024 --> 26:32.329
It was clean.

26:34.331 --> 26:35.158
[doorbell rings]

26:35.202 --> 26:36.682
SHEILA [OS]:
Who's that?

26:36.725 --> 26:38.379
No, wait a second. No, nobody
needs get up, I'll get it.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.902
Claire, eat your food.

26:41.512 --> 26:42.513
TIM [OS]:
Hey, Garret my son!

26:42.557 --> 26:43.776
GARRET [OS]:
Hi, good to see you.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.647
Good to see you. Well, just
dropped by, huh?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.170
GARRET [OS]:
Yeah, sorry I'm a little late.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.172
TIM [OS]:
Hey look who's here
everybody. Garret.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.783
Garret. You remember Garret for
God's sake!

26:50.826 --> 26:52.045
GARRET [OS]:
Hey, everyone.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.655
TIM [OS]:
Come on join us for
dinner.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.745
Garret, you remember, Valerie.
This is Valerie's friend Kazem.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.356
Fiance dad.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.183
Hello Kazem.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.751
It's Hazem.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.800
DETECTIVE HAVEN:
Was that the first time you met
Hazem Seif?

27:07.843 --> 27:09.192
GARRET:
I'd seen him before...

27:09.236 --> 27:11.281
but I hadn't officially met him
'till that night.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.025
What was your impression of him?

27:16.069 --> 27:17.984
I dunno.

27:18.027 --> 27:22.597
You dunno? You got five don't
you?

27:22.641 --> 27:23.511
What?

27:23.554 --> 27:25.208
Do you have five? You have five.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.383
Um.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.776
No, no, no, no. you stupid
little twerp.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.691
No, Five sens-

27:29.735 --> 27:32.389
Five senses. You know, Hearing,
taste, feeling.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.434
What?

27:33.477 --> 27:35.697
Hello! God gave you five
senses.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.046
Now what was your impression of
him?

27:37.090 --> 27:39.788
What was your opinion of Hazem
Seif?

27:39.832 --> 27:43.879
He was kinda rude I guess. It
was just..

27:43.923 --> 27:45.664
It was an awkward
night.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.622
TIM [OS]:
Kazem was just telling us about
living in Egypt.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.102
It's a very interesting place.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.712
Mom, can I speak to you for a
minute?

27:50.756 --> 27:52.671
Oh. Valerie sweetheart, not now.

27:52.714 --> 27:53.889
Garret, would you like something
to drink.

27:53.933 --> 27:54.760
Mom!

27:54.803 --> 27:58.415
Golly, alright. Excuse us.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.900
Mom what the hell is he doing
here?

28:04.944 --> 28:06.293
I bring my fiance to meet
you,

28:06.336 --> 28:08.904
And you invite my ex-boyfriend
on the same night?

28:08.948 --> 28:10.558
Valerie, I'm not in love with
your tone.

28:10.601 --> 28:11.777
I have chosen someone

28:11.820 --> 28:14.214
So your guys' little plan isn't
going to work.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.824
That's fine.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.392
Now let's go back to our guests
and enjoy a pleasant dinner.

28:18.435 --> 28:19.393
And Valerie.

28:19.436 --> 28:20.176
What?

28:20.220 --> 28:21.047
You're hair--

28:21.090 --> 28:23.310
Oh my God, mom! Stop!

28:40.109 --> 28:42.242
Where's the other guy?

28:42.285 --> 28:43.634
AGENT LONG [OS]:
The other guy?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.332
Yeah. The other detective who
was talking to me.

28:45.375 --> 28:49.728
Oh gramps? He had to go home.
But daddy's here now.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.339
I'm not a detective. I'm a
federal agent.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.471
But I already told--

28:54.515 --> 28:56.038
First question is,

28:56.082 --> 29:00.260
What kind of relationship did
you and Garret Perrin have?

29:00.303 --> 29:01.435
We didn't.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.307
I hate college girls. Other
people...

29:04.351 --> 29:06.788
they usually wait till the
fourth or fifth question...

29:06.832 --> 29:08.355
before they start lying
to me.

29:08.398 --> 29:11.401
But college girls. There's
nothing honest about them.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.751
VALERIE [OS]:
I'm not lying.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.143
AGENT LONG [OS]:
What did you tell the detective?

29:14.187 --> 29:17.494
Oh, God. We used to date! It was
a long time ago.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.409
Your fiance know about this?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.369
TIM [OS]:
So I'm telling ya, this
fish. 20 pounds, 8 inches.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.763
I mean you had to see this son
of a bitch to believe it.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.460
Now what're you girls doing?
Where've you been?

29:26.503 --> 29:28.201
What're you doing?

29:28.244 --> 29:31.813
SHEILA [OS]:
Valerie, just wanted
to show me something, dear.

29:31.857 --> 29:35.295
Kazem wants to be a Doctor in
Egypt.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.252
Dad, we really don't have to
talk about this.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.340
That's lovely dear.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.428
I never actually said that.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.433
Egypt, you know? Egypt.

29:43.477 --> 29:47.176
Isn't that where those doctors
there molested all those kids?

29:47.220 --> 29:50.223
SHEILA [OS]:
That's neither here
nor there.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.441
VALERIE [OS]:
That was a rumor,
Dad.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.791
Well just the same,

29:52.834 --> 29:55.750
I'm interested in Hazem's
stance on the matter.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.666
Uh, I don't really have much of
a stance, actually.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.364
If you think about it, one
person's actions can't really

30:01.408 --> 30:02.713
speak for a large group of
people anyway--

30:02.757 --> 30:04.846
You know all this talk of
politics, marvelous.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.630
SHEILA [OS]:
Valerie, would you pass the
corn?

30:06.674 --> 30:08.154
So what you're saying is that

30:08.197 --> 30:09.764
it doesn't make any difference,
I mean, for instance...

30:09.808 --> 30:11.200
culturally or whatever?

30:11.244 --> 30:14.029
Hazem, Tim's just trying to get
to know you better.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.552
Yeah, I'm just asking
questions.

30:15.596 --> 30:18.425
I mean everybody around here
doesn't have to stand...

30:18.468 --> 30:21.863
on political correctness amongst
family and friends.

30:21.907 --> 30:22.690
TIM [OS]:
Right, Garret?

30:22.733 --> 30:23.647
Yeah.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.780
You know, I think um...

30:25.824 --> 30:28.174
I think we're done getting to
know each other.

30:28.217 --> 30:31.220
I think Mr. Davis and I know
each other very well by now.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.874
Oh, is that supposed to mean
something?

30:32.918 --> 30:41.404
Yes. Yes sir, it is. Excuse me.
Garret, it was nice meeting you.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.189
I should probably get going.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.581
TIM [OS]:
No, you sit down, son.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.627
You just stay right the hell
where you are.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.979
What is wrong with you? Are you
crazy?

30:51.023 --> 30:51.893
CLAIRE:
Valerie!

30:51.937 --> 30:53.373
TIM [OS]:
I must be.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.071
I must be crazy to allow
somebody like that in my home.

That's not what we're talking

So elasticity basically lets us
compare apples and oranges.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.480
It's a unit-free measure
that allows us to...

34:51.524 --> 34:55.571
quantify the differences in the
market without standardizing...

34:55.614 --> 34:57.182

this is in graphical form.

Ku Klux Klan? No

been calling me every other day.

That's what I'm trying to say

Is that everything is
relative. Every single thing.

Well you need to be a little
more specific Garret.

45:46.787 --> 45:54.926
I mean opinions can be relative.
But math. Math is relative?

45:54.969 --> 45:58.451

Absolutely. Who decided that ten
was ten?

46:14.467 --> 46:16.338

Why is ten the number where we
start over?

47:10.653 --> 47:13.395
Ya know, why isn't it eight?

47:13.439 --> 47:17.269
Ya know, why don't we go 5, 6,
7, 8, and then 1, 2, 3, 4?

Wow. And you go to college.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.276
How many fingers and thumbs do I
have?

47:24.319 --> 47:27.366
That's probably why we count
to ten.

47:27.409 --> 47:28.628
No but see--

47:28.671 --> 47:29.368
I cheated, okay?

01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:27.754

all these people...

01:00:33.107 --> 01:00:34.543

Don't you see what's going
on in there you dumb ass?

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.546
You wanna see the real
criminals, look behind you.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:39.548

You guys are creating a
traffic hazard.

01:00:39.592 --> 01:00:42.203
Now we need everyone to get off
the street now!

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:44.771

Why are you here?

01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:40.392

You brought me here. I
don't know.

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:42.611
You wanna know what I think?

01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:45.092
I think you were looking for
some truth.

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:47.791
And you thought I could give it
to you.

01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:53.535
Truth is you flinch when you're
at the bank...

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.929
and two homies walk in.

01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:59.498
You're not surprised when you're
driving down the highway...

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.413

pass by.

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:18.735
No one tells us to feel this
way.

We just feel it on your own.

01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:25.872
The media doesn't put these
stereotypes into our heads.

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:29.267
Television only mirrors reality.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.836
It's our experiences that tell
us that there are good people

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:40.104
and there are bad people. And
now I'm telling you.

01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:42.584
I'm telling you all the things
that you think...

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:46.327
but you won't say. It's not
their poverty.

01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:49.678
It's not lack of education that
makes them criminals.

01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:51.768
No one goes to the ghetto and
passes out guns.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:52.943

That's all.

You don't need to know a guy in

kill him.

Guys just stop arguing!

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:35.220
KEVIN:
Guys!

01:12:35.263 --> 01:12:36.221
MALIK [OS]:
What?

01:12:36.264 --> 01:12:37.265
KEVIN [OS]:
Trey is missing.

01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:38.310
MALIK [OS]:
It's gonna be alright!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.920
KEVIN [OS]:
You don't know that!

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.878
TREY:
[on voicemail]
Hi. You've reached Tremayne
Torrance.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.270
Please leave me a message...

01:12:42.314 --> 01:12:43.837
... and I'll get back to you as
soon as possible.

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:54.457
Rose. Rose! Where are you going?
Rose!

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:58.504
SAM:
Dude I am not going to jail for
this man!

01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:00.158
GARRET [OS]:
Oh my God.

01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:01.420
What the hell was that,
Alexander?

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.508
NOLAN [OS]:
Dude just shut up!

01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:03.944
Don't tell me to shut up, Nolan!

01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:06.120
I told you you're hitting too
hard!

01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:07.295
And where the hell did that come
from?

01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:08.949
I hit him too hard?

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:10.908
And you kicking him in the face
was good for his health, right?

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.257
ALEXANDER:
Would you just cut it out?

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.780
Guys we gotta get out of here.

01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:16.087
No, no we can't just leave him
here.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.436
Our fingerprints are all over
him!

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.612
Dude, fists don't leave
fingerprints!

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:20.526
We weren't feeling him up!

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.398
We gotta hide the body man.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.747
We can't hide the body.

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.139
SAM [OS]:
We can't just leave him here
man.

01:13:25.183 --> 01:13:28.142
We can't leave. He recognized
me. He saw my face.

01:13:28.665 --> 01:13:30.188
He's dead, man.

01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:31.450
Nolan: Why does that matter?
GARRET: I know! I know that!

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.887
He was drunk? Maybe
he hit his head.

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.498
Right? Maybe he hit his head.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:38.631
Sam look at his face! How's he
supposed to do that to himself?

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:40.807
I don't know!

01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:44.855
Sam. You got any rope in your
car?

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.771
Yeah. Yeah...

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:48.989
Go get it.

01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:50.643
Holy shit Alexander.

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:52.906
NOLAN: What? What?
GARRET: What the hell is that?

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.386
ALEXANDER [OS]:
You just said it.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.301
He did it to himself.

01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:59.478
He hit himself in the face with
a crowbar?

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.439
Are you thinking right?

01:14:04.701 --> 01:14:06.833
You gonna help me with this,
brother?

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:08.574
You gonna help me with
this, brother?

01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:17.148
Yeah, I'll help you. But after
that I'm out man. I'm out.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:18.889
Go get the stool too.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:20.717
Okay.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.109
The one that Garret brought.

01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:24.895
SAM [OS]:
Okay. Alright.

01:14:26.374 --> 01:14:30.378
DETECTIVE HAVEN:
Who's idea was it to fake a
suicide?

01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:31.902
Alexander.

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:34.252
Now, wait. People saw you coming
out of the fraternity...

01:14:34.295 --> 01:14:35.514
with that stool, Garret.

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:37.647
No. I didn't touch him.

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:39.083
Why'd you bring the stool, huh?
Why?

01:14:39.126 --> 01:14:40.693
GARRET [OS]:
I didn't-

01:14:40.737 --> 01:14:41.825
Come on.

01:14:41.868 --> 01:14:42.739
GARRET [OS]:
He told me to bring it.

01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:45.481
I didn't know what it was for.

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:47.178
And then what happened?

01:14:48.092 --> 01:14:49.659
[train in the distance]

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.820
ALEXANDER:
Well?

01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.395
[ominous music]

01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:48.979
What happened after that?

01:15:49.022 --> 01:15:50.546
I don't remember.

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:53.157
You aided in the murder of an
innocent man.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.594
No. Wait a minute! I didn't
touch him.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.596
My fingerprints weren't on him.
I was just there.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.815
You did not stop them.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:00.773
Is that a crime?

01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:02.819
Of course it is. Criminal
facilitation.

01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:05.125
What?

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:07.780
You had knowledge of the
incident. That's an accessory.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:09.260
GARRET [OS]:
Wait a minute. I was--

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:12.480
You stated you didn't know the
whereabouts of...

01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:16.006
Alexander Kraus, Samuel
Boergadine, or Nolan Miller.

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:17.834
No.

01:16:17.877 --> 01:16:18.748
DETECTIVE HAVEN [OS]:
Who else was there?

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.140
GARRET [OS]:
I don't know. I--

01:16:20.184 --> 01:16:22.055
Who else was there?

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.760
AGENT LONG:
We spoke to your trainer Dimon.

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:35.852
ANd uh, you've had some weapons
training too, is that right?

01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:45.339
Oh I get it. So, I didn't go to
the protest and so I'm a racist.

01:16:45.383 --> 01:16:49.648
I had weapons training so I'm a
murderer.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:54.566
And now, put two and two, I must
have killed him.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.264
I'm glad we're on the same page.
Give me a minute.

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:59.789
I'll have someone get you a
formal letter of confession.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:04.010
Yeah you know what, let's do it.
Do you think this is funny?

01:17:04.532 --> 01:17:09.189
Yes, I do. But I wasn't the
one...

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.191
who was identified at the scene
of a murder...

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.193
standing under Tremayne's body
holding a weapon.

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:17.328
Ha! It was a baseball bat.
It's not a weapon.

01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:20.461
Plus the kid was lynched, right?
So with some detective work...

01:17:20.505 --> 01:17:21.506
you'll realize that
your assumption...

01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:22.812
doesn't mean anything.

01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:27.512
Oh, clever. But must I remind
you that Tremayne was beaten...

01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:31.429
before he was hung? Surprised,
huh?

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:34.606
Aside from having his neck
broken, snapped...

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.130
Tremayne's left arm was broken.

01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:38.828
What kind of weapon do you think
was suitable for that?

01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:42.048
Do you know? Do you know or
should I tell you?

01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:45.399
No man save your breath. You'll
need it to blow up your date.

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:47.401
Listen you arrogant prick.

01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:50.361
I have an eye witness who said
you helped kill him.

01:17:50.404 --> 01:17:52.319
How about that?

01:17:55.583 --> 01:18:01.067
You know what your problem is?
You don't know how to lie.

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.113
Go ahead check the bat for DNA.

01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:14.167
Hey buddy, a guy does that to my
fiance, shit, I'd kill him too.

01:18:17.475 --> 01:18:21.827
You wanna hit me? Hm? Take a
shot.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:25.135
How about you shut your Goddamn
mouth?

01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:35.232
You had to go. A tough guy like
you. Couldn't just go home,

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:40.280
look her in the eye, knowing
that another man touched her.

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:42.805
Had his hands all over her.

01:18:43.414 --> 01:18:50.116
The minute you got that phone
call, your mind was made up.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.469
The minute you got that call,
Tremayne was a dead man.

01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:00.387
You know what, go screw
yourself.

01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:02.259
I'm not answering any
more of your questions.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:04.478
I'm not even finished yet.

01:19:04.522 --> 01:19:07.220
We're just getting to the juicy
stuff right now.

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:08.613
VALERIE:
This isn't a joke.

01:19:08.656 --> 01:19:14.575
No honey, it's not. But you
know what is funny?

01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:16.839
You date one guy. Dump him.

01:19:16.882 --> 01:19:21.800
Get engaged to another. Then you
get him to murder a third guy.

01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:27.458
All for you, Valerie. Valerie
of Troy. Or Sparta.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:31.984
Which is it? Troy or Sparta?

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.335
Hell with you, it might be both.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:39.949
I didn't get him to do anything!
I mean he didn't murder him.

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:41.777
AGENT LONG: Prove it!
VALERIE: I don't have to!

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:46.912
This is not a game, princess. A
young man was lynched.

01:19:47.347 --> 01:19:48.784
And I need answers.

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.350
Now you give me something to
dance with.

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.700
Why am I being interrogated?

01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:55.965
I need the overtime.

01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:57.705
I'm the only one who has no
reason to be here.

01:19:57.749 --> 01:19:58.794
Can you explain that?

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:05.409
You're a smart girl. Take a stab
at it.

01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:09.456
You want me to say something
that you can use against Hazem.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.196
Final answer?

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.502
Is that why I'm here?

01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:14.287
Look I hate to be the one to
tell you honey.

01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:21.642
But you should know that Romeo
actually testified against you.

01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:25.821
What?

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:26.691
AGENT LONG [OS]:
He told me you were the last
person to see Tremayne alive.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:30.347
Said you saw him in an
alley.

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.436
Couple hours later he was found
dead.

01:20:32.479 --> 01:20:34.220
So that's why you're here
princess.

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:38.790
Romeo's gonna spend a long time
in prison.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.098
So I suggest you put the
wedding off.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.884
That's okay, I'll wait for him.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:46.972
After he testified against you?

01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:48.278
He didn't!

01:20:49.235 --> 01:20:51.411
He killed a man and he wanted to
frame you!

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:52.760
He had no reason to kill anyone!

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.240
He had all the reason he needed
because of you.

01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:54.937
That's not true.

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:55.807
There's no one else.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:56.634
There were four other guys--

01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:57.853
No one else with a reason.

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.071
They all had reasons! You don't
have him!

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.290
I'm gonna hang him for it.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.421
You're lying.

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:02.509
If he didn't do it, you know who
did.

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:06.731
I did it! Okay? It was me. I did
it.

01:21:08.559 --> 01:21:10.343
VALERIE [VO]:
Imagine if you could get a
glimpse...

01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:12.389
through someone else's
eyes.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.962
Suddenly, judging them loses its
appeal.

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:23.661
AGENT LONG [OS]:
So I want you to listen to me
closely.

01:21:23.704 --> 01:21:26.055
We have an eye witness
who saw Hazem...

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:31.364
at the scene of your brother's
murder. Now we got him...

01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:37.718
and we got you. You saw him
right after. He's a young man.

01:21:37.762 --> 01:21:40.983
His fiance was just assaulted
by Tremayne...

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.767
less than an hour before he was
killed.

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:46.336
ROSE:
Tremayne didn't touch her! She
ran off crying to her friends...

01:21:46.379 --> 01:21:49.121
because she saw a black guy in a
hoodie.

01:21:49.165 --> 01:21:50.644
My brother didn't touch her.

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:55.475
All the numbers add up Rose. All
we need is you.

01:21:55.519 --> 01:21:59.697
So let me ask you again.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.612
Did you see anything to
indicate that...

01:22:01.655 --> 01:22:04.615
Hazem Seif took part in murder
your brother?

01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:08.314
No! I already said no. What is
this?

01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:10.099
AGENT LONG [OS]:
Do you understand what you're
doing?

01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:12.710
You could be letting
Trey's killer get away.

01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:15.539
No one would doubt you about
Hazem.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:16.888
Is that what this is about?

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:20.283
You need to decide what side
you're on, Rose.

01:22:20.326 --> 01:22:23.939
Now, let's try to do the right
thing.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:26.115
The right thing.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:33.600
[ominous music]

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:42.392
Oh my God.

01:22:47.484 --> 01:22:48.789
ROSE [OS]:
Trey!

01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:54.839
ROSE [OS]:
Oh my-

01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.363
[scream]

01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:01.063
ROSE [OS]:
What did you do?

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:04.457
HAZEM:
No, no I just got here. I just
got here.

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:09.985
ROSE [OS]:
Please, wake up! That's my
brother!

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.247
What did you do to him?

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.684
I didn't do anything! You think
I did this?

01:23:13.727 --> 01:23:18.689
Go away. Go away!

01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:24.564
Here Trey. He's cold and you're
just standing here.

01:23:24.608 --> 01:23:30.527
Here Trey. Oh God.

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:35.271
[sobs uncontrollably]

01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:44.541
No! Get off of him! Get off of
him.

01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:45.977
Just shut up a minute I got
this!

01:23:48.284 --> 01:23:56.118
What are you doing? C'mon Trey
come down. Yeah. Get him down.

01:23:58.163 --> 01:23:59.991
[scream]

01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:06.824
[intense sobbing]

01:24:11.568 --> 01:24:21.491
Oh please. Please. Wake up,
Trey.

01:24:22.927 --> 01:24:25.930
ROSE [OS]:
What did you do to my brother?
What did you do to my brother?

01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:27.497
What did you do?

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.847
I just got here! I already told
you that! Are you crazy!?

01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:32.589
What happened to him? What
happened to my brother?

01:24:35.244 --> 01:24:38.595
Tremayne!

01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:43.730
[dramatic music]

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:45.689
Oh God...

01:24:46.255 --> 01:24:49.562
[sobs]

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.223
[trian in the distance]

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:10.643
ROSE [VO]:
Only under extreme
circumstances...

01:26:10.687 --> 01:26:13.777
only when we're pushed to our
limits...

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.215
only when we have so much at
stake...

01:26:17.259 --> 01:26:21.350
is our character truly tested.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:27.182
And how we respond says
everything about who we are.

01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:30.924
HAZEM [VO]:
We argue about right and wrong.

01:26:31.882 --> 01:26:34.972
Meanwhile the guilty walk
away unpunished.

01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:38.236
Then we say justice is served,
but it doesn't mean that...

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.108
injustice didn't happen.

01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:45.287
Justice won't be served as long
as the good are silent.

01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:54.644
GARRET [VO]:
It's always obvious when
you look back on it...

01:26:54.687 --> 01:26:58.213
what was right and what was
wrong.

01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:07.700
GARRET:
I got the grant. Thirty thousand
dollars. It's a lot of money.

01:27:09.006 --> 01:27:12.792
But I'm giving it to a
childrens' home...

01:27:12.836 --> 01:27:17.188
in the inner city. It was
supposed to be for you.

01:27:27.285 --> 01:27:34.945
I miss you. Dad, I
miss you so much.

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.515
I didn't have enough time with
you.

01:27:41.995 --> 01:27:45.956
But I'm okay, I'm okay though.

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:48.872
And I know what I did was
wrong...

01:27:48.915 --> 01:27:52.571
and I take full responsibility
for it.

01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:55.313
From now on, I'm gonna be a
better person.

01:27:55.357 --> 01:27:57.359
I'm gonna do good things.

01:27:58.795 --> 01:28:02.146
I'm going to make things right
again.

01:28:03.887 --> 01:28:05.497
I'm going to make things right
again.

01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:15.028
ROSE [VO]:
First there was God. And then
there was light.

01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:20.512
And then there was Man. And Man
was different.

01:28:20.556 --> 01:28:25.430
And then they killed one another
because they were different.

01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:30.479
VALERIE [VO]:
Everybody wants progress. But if
you're on the wrong road...

01:28:30.522 --> 01:28:33.917
then progress is the worst
thing to have.

01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:37.486
GARRET [VO]:
People say that in an ideal
world...

01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:40.532
you would never notice a
person's color.

01:28:40.576 --> 01:28:43.709
But that can only happen after
appreciation.

01:28:43.753 --> 01:28:46.538
And appreciation can only come
after acceptance.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:52.109
ROSE [VO]:
We would notice a splinter in a
stranger's eyes...

01:28:52.152 --> 01:28:55.504
while overlooking the branch in
our own.

01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:58.376
VALERIE [VO]:
Racism is rooted in violence.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.727
And violence is rooted in
racism.

01:29:02.772 --> 01:29:05.340
ROSE [VO]:
Once you're able to scare
people...

01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:07.124
it's easy to control them.

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.256
Manipulate them.

01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:12.172
HAZEM [VO]:
Fear rules all.

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:15.350
[gunshot]

01:29:15.393 --> 01:29:15.915
STUDENT [OS]:
Woah!

01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:16.481
[screams]

01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:17.221
Oh my God!

01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:18.353
[screams]

01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:24.097
STUDENT [OS]:
Call the cops! Someone call the
cops!

01:29:33.977 --> 01:29:36.109
HAZEM [VO]:
What if we just need to stop
being afraid?

01:29:38.547 --> 01:29:40.287
VALERIE [VO]:
What if we're all guilty?

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:46.598
ROSE [VO]:
What about the violence? Who's
guilty of that?

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:57.043
MEGAN:
Stop!

01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:01.004
[dramatic music]

01:31:16.732 --> 01:31:21.084
[soulful music]
