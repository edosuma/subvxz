27:33.445 --> 27:35.489
It seems he is their manager.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.871
I didn't know he was coming.
I'll sort it later.

29:56.755 --> 29:57.589
Who are they?

44:24.414 --> 44:26.083
Let's put them even further
back.

1:19:09.499 --> 1:19:10.542
Hey, is everything alright?

1:19:10.626 --> 1:19:11.627
Yes, I'll find him.

1:19:15.088 --> 1:19:15.672
Hurry!

1:19:15.756 --> 1:19:16.465
I'll find him.

1:19:16.965 --> 1:19:18.800
Don't worry.
He'll get him on stage in time.

1:25:23.832 --> 1:25:24.833
OK guys, put your heads on.

1:25:25.417 --> 1:25:27.044
We can do this without him.

1:25:39.223 --> 1:25:40.891
Grindah needs to be on stage.

1:25:54.613 --> 1:25:57.533
-We're going to do this without him.
-You seriously think that's going to work?

1:25:58.909 --> 1:26:02.538
Taka knows the dance routine.

1:27:02.973 --> 1:27:04.057
WEAR IT!

1:28:31.937 --> 1:28:33.605
This is embarrassing.
