WEBVTT

00:41.792 --> 00:43.623
Proceedings close Tuesday.
-In six days.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.251
We submitted a delinquency letter
three weeks ago.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.710
I know I'm behind, but I'm owed
unemployment and my sister said--

00:49.884 --> 00:52.125
Yeah, I wish there was something more
I could do.

00:52.303 --> 00:53.418
You can't kick us out!

00:56.474 --> 00:58.965
-l have a second job interview.
-lt's out of my hands.

01:40.685 --> 01:43.347
Shots fired, colon, multiple, period.

01:43.521 --> 01:47.685
Final phase successful, period.
Activation of AR 105...

01:47.858 --> 01:49.940
...complete, period.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.851
End of entry.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.290
The answer is no.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.577
I gave up one life.
Do you think I'm gonna start over?

02:09.755 --> 02:12.007
Do it all again?
You're crazier than I imagined.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.335
You can't go back to Philly.
It's too dangerous.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.842
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Stay here in this?

02:17.013 --> 02:18.753
I can't believe you brought me here.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.638
I'll tell you where I'm gonna go:
home, with my husband.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.095
Frank has daughters.
Think he's gonna walk out?

02:24.270 --> 02:27.762
-I need to know where Jennifer is.
-I kept my end of the bargain.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.057
Didn't say anything about you
or Elizabeth.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.351
-How much does she know?
-Very little.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.944
Are the--?

02:40.119 --> 02:43.236
Are the two of you,
what, working together?

02:43.706 --> 02:47.244
-I don't wanna know how you pulled that.
-Listen to me, about Jennifer...

02:47.418 --> 02:49.033
...I can protect her.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.711
I'll never tell you
where my daughter is.

02:53.049 --> 02:56.507
Because of you,
I'm forced to finally tell Frank...

02:56.677 --> 03:00.670
...who's never kept a secret from me,
not only that l was married before...

03:00.848 --> 03:03.305
...but that l was married to--

03:04.268 --> 03:07.180
He sits me down,
tells me he's sorry for me.

03:07.355 --> 03:11.314
Try and wrap your warped mind
around that.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.435
The man's entire life is upended.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.524
All he can think about is me.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.116
The arrangements have been made.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.494
Passports, identities...

03:25.873 --> 03:27.454
...a new life.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.289
Talk it over with Frank.

03:32.588 --> 03:36.547
If you love him, you'll let me help.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.518
-Where's Naomi Hyland?
-ln safe hands.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.354
What does that mean?
You've set her up with a new life...

03:56.529 --> 03:57.894
...in Saint Kitts or Solvang?

03:58.072 --> 04:02.065
Solvang? I never send anyone
I care about to Solvang.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.655
She spent nine days with Berlin.
We have to debrief her.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.571
She could know something,
his real name, his location....

04:07.748 --> 04:09.830
Did you read
about that housewife in Reston?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.206
She shot a bank manager.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.789
You're not hiding her from the FBI.
You're hiding her from me.

04:13.963 --> 04:17.296
Violent crime in D.C.
is at a 20-year low...

04:17.466 --> 04:19.297
...and yet in the last four months...

04:19.468 --> 04:23.256
...there have been seven random acts
of violence by individuals...

04:23.431 --> 04:25.547
with no prior criminal record.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.966
Lizzy, what do you know
about social psychology?

04:29.145 --> 04:31.761
The study of how behavior
is influenced by the world.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.645
Not influenced. Manipulated.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.432
In what little time I devote
to the judgment...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.896
...your government has made
about my character...

04:39.071 --> 04:41.357
...and how I treat my fellow man,
I can't help...

04:41.532 --> 04:45.616
...but think about how many of their own
citizens they've treated like lab rats...

04:45.786 --> 04:47.071
...in the name of science.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.237
I believe this murder in Reston...

04:49.415 --> 04:53.078
...is part of an underground
social-psychology experiment.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.867
Conducted by our government.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.334
Strap on your tinfoil hat, Lizzy.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.626
According to Reddington, three recent
incidents prove the US. government...

05:03.804 --> 05:06.261
...is still conducting
mind-control experiments.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.891
Terry Cho, a school teacher who killed
seven coworkers during his lunch break.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.428
Construction worker Henry Lee Bryce
used a hammer and a box cutter.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.893
-Killed by police.
-The third, Maddie Thornhill...

05:17.067 --> 05:19.649
...single mom who opened fire
at a bank in Reston.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.153
Reddington has alleged
that these crimes weren't random...

05:23.324 --> 05:26.066
...but orchestrated by spooks
the government finances...

05:26.243 --> 05:28.620
-...through their black-ops budget.
-To be honest...

05:28.787 --> 05:31.199
...I think this is a distraction
to keep us busy...

05:31.373 --> 05:33.409
...while Reddington spirits away his ex.

05:33.584 --> 05:37.372
Interview the shooters and their families.
Then we'll worry about the wife.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.330
Hey.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.124
What would you say
if I told you to pull Frank...

05:43.302 --> 05:45.714
...and Naomi's phone records
for the past five years?

05:46.222 --> 05:49.430
-|'d ask if you had a warrant.
-Would you ask me to show it to you?

05:49.600 --> 05:53.764
Why would I do that?
I trust you implicitly, Agent Keen.

05:56.899 --> 06:01.063
Special Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI,
here to interview Madeline Thornhill.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.858
I'm sorry, she's on a 48-hour hold.
Suicide watch.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.240
-No visitors.
-She's talking to someone right now.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.618
Her psychiatrist. I'll pass along
your contact info, if you'd like.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.240
Really don't know
when things just started to fall apart.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.543
First, it was my job.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.962
Maddie was getting a ton
of bad reviews on Yelp.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.121
By name. People said she was unhelpful,
even rude.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.915
Don't know why they give
so much weight to those things.

06:25.094 --> 06:28.336
No one seemed dissatisfied, but
the things they were saying about me--

06:28.514 --> 06:33.508
I tried to work with her on it, but she kept
making excuses. Crazy stuff, paranoid.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.098
-Like what?
-Like somebody was out to get her...

06:36.272 --> 06:38.934
...posting fake reviews.
She was argumentative.

06:39.108 --> 06:42.225
-Finally, I had to let her go.
-Things fell apart with Charlie.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.563
I really had no choice.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.604
I'm in a custody battle,
the court's got me under a microscope.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.443
Came down to her or my kids.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.484
-Did you ever see her mistreat them?
-I loved his kids.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.618
I would never hurt any child.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.826
But Social Services started
getting anonymous calls...

06:57.001 --> 06:59.458
...that when I was over there,
they were crying.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.916
I actually thought about getting one
of those spy cams, you know?

07:03.090 --> 07:06.833
But then I'm thinking,
if it's come to that, what's the point?

07:07.011 --> 07:08.046
He just dumped me.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.252
After almost two years.

07:10.431 --> 07:14.674
One minute, I've got a great job,
a boyfriend, and the next...

07:14.852 --> 07:18.686
She started making late payments
on her mortgage. We tried to help.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.437
She was three months behind.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.224
Without any income,
we had to foreclose.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.313
They just took it...

07:26.572 --> 07:28.608
...Iike it was just a house.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.860
But it wasn't just a house.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.742
-Was it?
-No.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.828
It was me.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.538
Maddie Thornhil/ told us...

07:38.709 --> 07:41.576
...her life fell apart after a series
of anonymous accusations.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.745
The shooter I spoke to
said the same thing.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.083
In his case,
it was accusations of pedophilia.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.590
There were no witnesses,
no victims came fon/vard.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.127
School didn't want to take chances,
they fired him.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.843
Their problems metastasized
like a cancer striking to the heart...

07:55.017 --> 07:57.008
-...of these victims' identities.
-Victims?

07:57.186 --> 07:59.893
These aren't victims.
People they killed are the victims.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.977
All I'm saying is that some people
aren't wired to handle stress.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.266
Someone took advantage.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.810
Agent Keen had me
expedite DNA profiles.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.776
All three perpetrators possess
the MAO-A2R gene.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.862
-The extreme-warrior gene.
-C|inical studies have proven...

08:15.037 --> 08:18.621
...people who possess this are prone
to aggressive, antisocial behavior.

08:18.791 --> 08:21.498
Are you suggesting
the government has identified people...

08:21.669 --> 08:24.627
...with genetic abnormality
and is turning them into killers?

08:24.797 --> 08:26.879
That's exactly what we're suggesting.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.549
Police have not yet commented
on how the chase started.

08:34.723 --> 08:38.011
But sources say the driver
shot three clerks this morning...

08:38.185 --> 08:41.473
-...inside of a--
-Phase two concluded, period.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.265
AR106 showing signs
of deterioration, comma...

08:45.442 --> 08:48.684
...accelerating to final break.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.353
---with a weapon.
-Oh, no. Oh, God.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.989
Ofﬁcers have just opened ﬁre.
We are going to--

08:59.998 --> 09:02.580
Final phase successful, period.

09:03.752 --> 09:07.665
Activation of subject AR106
concluded, period.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.922
End of entry.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.800
-Senator's office. How may I help you?
-Hello, yes.

09:16.974 --> 09:21.263
This is Dr. Linus Creel.
I'm calling for Senator Sheridan.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.142
The perp in the freeway shooting,
I hear he had this warrior gene.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.939
Yeah. Agent Navabi has identified
11 other cases in the last 18 months.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.073
-No connection other--
-They share this.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.280
And it's notjust
some statistical anomaly.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.657
It's as if they're being triggered.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.161
-Close the door.
-Sir?

09:49.173 --> 09:51.004
You know something?

09:54.136 --> 09:57.003
Every word Reddington said
about this program is true.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.681
In the Army, officers sit in bars
and they talk sideways.

10:01.852 --> 10:05.015
"A guy who knows a guy
who knows a guy."

10:05.189 --> 10:07.851
MK-ULTRA was just the start.
There were others.

10:08.025 --> 10:11.813
Quietly run in military bases
and universities all across the country.

10:11.987 --> 10:15.024
Psychopharmaceuticals,
electromagnetic pulses...

10:15.365 --> 10:19.825
...microwaves that broadcast
words and phrases into the brain.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.488
I love this country, but once in a while,
you hear something like this...

10:24.666 --> 10:27.328
...some bone-evil crap
that's almost inconceivable.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.585
That's what I hate most
about this detail.

10:29.755 --> 10:34.749
Reddington pulling up the carpet
and shoving your nose deep into the filth.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.252
After a while, it's all you can see.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.216
-Subproject 7.
-I don't know what that is.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.136
It's a black-budget program.
It's funded out of the DIA.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.226
The goal was
to use genetic predispositions...

10:50.400 --> 10:52.482
...to train and trigger assets.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.814
If it's black budget,
how am I to gain access?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.898
I am a dear friend of Harold Cooper.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.613
He was a pallbearer
in my daddy's funeral.

11:01.787 --> 11:06.531
But I told him when he called, only
yahoos are interested in Subproject 7.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.496
-So you're saying it doesn't exist?
-You're asking about mind control.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.255
This government can't make up
its own mind, let alone control one.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.791
-Senator, is that a yes or a no?
-It's a yes and a no.

11:17.970 --> 11:21.258
Have we studied mind control? Yes.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.762
Does it work?

11:22.933 --> 11:25.595
About as often
as a blind squirrel finds an acorn.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.636
We've been tracking a spike
in violent crimes, mass shootings.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.476
I'm gonna pay you the courtesy
of being blunt.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.401
You're wasting your time.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.523
If there's increase
in the incidence of violent crime...

11:36.697 --> 11:40.189
...you're not gonna find the answer
in the black budget of the government.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.698
Understood.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.032
But I also understand
that you do oversee that black budget.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.413
And Harold Cooper would appreciate it
if you could provide us...

11:48.584 --> 11:51.246
...with any information you have
on Subproject 7.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.910
Of course.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.205
My office will deliver
all pertinent documents.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.046
Now, if you will excuse me,
I am late for my next meeting.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.012
Yes, sir, how can I help you?

12:08.186 --> 12:12.270
Hi. Dr. Linus Creel.
I'm here to see Senator Sheridan.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.898
Honey, we have talked and talked
about this.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.530
I thought we were in complete
agreement. We decided not to run.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.777
-Now, I've talked to the FBI--
-The FBI can't protect us.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.330
And he can?

12:27.497 --> 12:30.079
Are you honestly suggesting
we upend our lives?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.992
Based on what? A criminal's promise
that he can help us?

12:33.170 --> 12:37.755
Yes. Yes, that is what I'm saying,
and I know how crazy it sounds.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.086
-He did this to you.
-I'm not defending him.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.841
But I do know him.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.627
How do you--?

12:45.724 --> 12:49.137
I'm sorry, I'm still trying to process
the fact you were married to him.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.895
And now you want to put our lives
in the hands of this lunatic?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.650
I'm not going anywhere.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.159
This is a mistake.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.491
I can't help you in Philadelphia.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.247
We've made up our mind.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.710
You know I would stop at nothing
to protect you.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.542
-We don't need your protection.
-Yes, you do.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.961
I understand it may be difficult...

13:22.135 --> 13:25.548
...for you to accept my help given
the history that Carla and I share.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.428
Don't flatter yourself.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.215
Carla Reddington
was a miserable housewife...

13:30.394 --> 13:32.225
...married to a miserable man.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.933
That woman no longer exists.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.018
We're not going anywhere.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.896
Everything the senator sent
is redacted.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.235
-Entire pages.
-Dollar amounts are omitted.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.826
-Project names are code.
-Yeah, "elegant lady," "forest green."

13:49.997 --> 13:53.080
If any of these are Subproject 7,
it'd be impossible to tell.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.161
-The polyglot.
-What?

13:55.335 --> 13:58.077
In Mossad, we have a contact.
He's like a code breaker.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.372
Give him your black-ops budget,
he'll tell us what they mean.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.542
-You have our black-ops budget?
-Polyglot. How do we find him?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.553
He was cleared level four.
I don't have that kind of access.

14:07.723 --> 14:12.183
Oh, my God.
Is that what they call him in Tel Aviv?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.308
I haven't spoken to Haskell in years.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.344
-But you know where to find him?
-I do.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.888
But it's a sticky situation.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.854
Old Haskell and I had somewhat
of a falling-out at the craps table.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.694
Hask--

14:34.207 --> 14:36.994
I have no interest in you.
Go away. You're not welcome here.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.785
Haskell, I told you I'm sorry.
What more can I say?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.955
-You knew I was in recovery.
-I didn't--

14:43.133 --> 14:46.591
Okay. Yes, I did.
But you were having such a great time.

14:46.762 --> 14:50.346
After everything that happened
with Sheryl and that Cuban, the boxer--

14:50.515 --> 14:53.097
-What was his name?
-I'm not talking to you about this.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.975
Yasiel! God, that hair. Beautiful hair.

14:56.146 --> 15:01.015
I thought you could use a little distraction.
You forget, we won 25,000 on one roll.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.479
Yes, and I lost twice that much
after you left.

15:03.653 --> 15:07.487
I woke up in that hotel. I still don't
even know how I got to Mesquite.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.114
That money means nothing to you,
but to me, it's--

15:10.952 --> 15:13.534
An olive branch, with interest.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.326
My friend Miss Watkins
is a blogger looking for her first scoop.

15:20.504 --> 15:23.246
I write mostly
about social-science experiments.

15:24.049 --> 15:29.089
Researching one right now, actually.
The black-ops project, Subproject 7?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.345
Why don't we take this into my office?

15:32.516 --> 15:34.381
It's V2K-shielded.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.145
Here she is. Government white paper
on Subproject 7.

15:40.315 --> 15:43.057
I've seen the white paper.
It's heavily redacted.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.854
What? How did you--?

15:49.032 --> 15:52.650
Haskell's quite a puzzle man.
Spends his days combing...

15:52.828 --> 15:56.821
...through thousands of pages
of redacted government documents...

15:56.998 --> 16:01.788
...comparing them to defense
authorization reports, executive orders.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.170
He's found a way
to read between the lines.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.705
I wouldn't have the patience.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.420
Subproject 7 was born out
of the human genome project.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.677
Some genius in government figured
that if DNA could be used...

16:12.848 --> 16:15.840
...to identify people predisposed
to cancer, it could be used...

16:16.017 --> 16:18.554
...to identify people predisposed
to become assassins.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.639
-Who are these people?
-The team.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.851
They used the brains of murderers
and reverse-engineered from there...

16:24.025 --> 16:26.437
...fine-tuned
a three-phase activation process.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.479
First phase, disruption of schedule,
routine, daily life.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.649
Second, destabilize sense of self-worth.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.906
Final phase was to sever
the primary emotional bond.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.945
Get all three, jackpot.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.450
This man here, who is he?
I've seen his face before.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.746
Oh, yes. He was their lab assistant,
Dr. Linus Creel.

16:54.306 --> 16:58.515
Dr. Linus Creel,
PhD in clinical psychology from NYU.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.597
After Subproject 7 disbanded,
he opened a private practice.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.638
Appears he supplements his income
working as a locum tenens...

17:04.816 --> 17:06.272
...at six area hospitals.

17:06.443 --> 17:10.402
I cross-referenced Creel's name
with the 11 warrior-gene killers.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.153
At some point, he was on staff...

17:12.324 --> 17:15.236
...at hospitals where the killers
were receiving counseling...

17:15.410 --> 17:18.777
-...including our Maddie Thornhill.
-That's how he's recruiting them.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.412
-Can we access his network?
-I can't break through.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.164
If I could somehow gain access...

17:23.335 --> 17:26.452
...I could upload a program
to deactivate it to hack his list.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.166
Come here. Take a look at this.

17:28.590 --> 17:32.048
Creel has this posted on his website,
calls it an intake questionnaire.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.632
-Some kind of IQ test?
-No, it's a modified MMPI-2.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.421
The Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.840
But it's heavily modified.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.852
He reconfigured
the test questions to flag...

17:44.022 --> 17:46.889
...aggression and low impulse control.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.274
That's how he finds the subjects
with the gene.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.776
What do you mean you won't tell?
Where are you?

17:51.947 --> 17:53.858
I'm gonna call her.
What's her number?

17:55.075 --> 17:57.282
No, Frank.
You said you were leaving your wife.

17:58.078 --> 18:02.287
Well, I don't care if it's a bad time.
Either you tell her about us or I will.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.540
Hey.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.705
That dog's been here all day.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.676
You leave your dog inside all day?
Who does that?

18:16.846 --> 18:20.009
What kind of monster leaves their dog
with no water, no food--?

18:20.183 --> 18:23.175
-Who the hell are you?
-He's done his business inside, twice!

18:23.603 --> 18:26.265
Any idea the psychological damage
that can do to a dog?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.771
-I don't know how you got--
-I spent 20 minutes...

18:28.942 --> 18:30.807
...cleaning up after him.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.902
Where's his leash?
I'm taking him for a walk.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.937
You are not taking my dog for a--

18:36.116 --> 18:38.448
Who are you?
I'm calling the police right now.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.323
Calm yourself down.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.412
We have a few things to talk about.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.087
Sit.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.465
She's exhausted.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.969
Why don't you and I go for a walk?

19:05.145 --> 19:08.854
This may be hard to understand, Frank,
but after all these years...

19:09.024 --> 19:13.438
...your wife has become more
like an estranged sister to me.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.693
We can't really bear
each other's company.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.106
But I've become
somewhat concerned...

19:19.284 --> 19:21.900
...about her general well being...

19:22.078 --> 19:24.615
...and sense of security.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.248
Are you threatening me?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.997
She loves you.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.500
You've made her happy.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.711
Given her a life, stability.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.883
The one thing I could never provide.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.642
Come closer, Frank.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.475
Frank. Come here.

19:51.649 --> 19:55.483
Aram, if I asked you to create an EMR,
could you feed it into their database?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.395
-You want a fake medical record?
-Yeah, family histories...

19:58.573 --> 20:01.440
...immunization records, addresses,
but most importantly...

20:01.618 --> 20:04.860
-...we'll need a full psychiatric history.
-Like what?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.574
Come on.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.538
That's Monica's dog.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.449
What the hell have you done?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.664
You're finished with Monica.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.169
Where is she?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.625
We had a few words...

20:16.800 --> 20:21.464
...and thanks to my friend's rather
judicious rescue, we also have a dog.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.970
-Monica, what did you do--?
-She's fine.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.806
But from this point fonNard...

20:27.602 --> 20:30.309
...there is only Naomi.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.898
She believes you
to be an honest man, Frank, faithful.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.434
And that is what you will become.

20:37.612 --> 20:41.651
You're going to accept my protection
and leave Philadelphia.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.238
No. I'm gonna call the cops,
turn you in.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.949
You're not gonna get away with this.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.869
You make her happy.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.340
That is the only reason
you're still here.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.635
Go get it, boy.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.437
City dog.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.185
Why would you do that?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.443
It's essential for you
to take responsibility for your actions.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.069
I was expelled.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.232
I understand.
And I have given this a lot of thought.

21:25.410 --> 21:29.995
I concluded the reason you told me you
cheated on your final was a cry for help.

21:30.165 --> 21:34.534
I believed telling your school
was in your best interest.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.702
The things we talk about,
they're secret.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.340
Duncan, the only way
that you are going to begin to get better...

21:41.509 --> 21:43.841
...is if you take responsibility
for your actions.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.755
You wanna move fonNard in your life,
right? With your parents? With Amber?

21:47.932 --> 21:50.594
Amber doesn't wanna meet.
We've only talked online.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.805
But you're getting healthier.
She's gonna wanna meet soon.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.897
It's time.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.523
Trust me.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.772
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.161
Dr. Creel, on-call nurse in the ER
just paged you for a psych consult.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.672
Girl's husband left her,
put her hand through a window.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.835
Attending wants you to take a look.
She's got a chart a mile long.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.429
Hello.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.058
You must be Angela.
My name is Dr. Creel.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.767
Says here you've been having
some troubles with your husband.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.107
That's an understatement.

22:44.656 --> 22:50.617
Now, I see that you've been treated
for depression and anxiety before.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.573
In college, postgrad.

22:52.747 --> 22:55.910
I had, you know, a rough patch.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.949
You were hospitalized.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.336
I know this must be difficult for you.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.339
I took some pills.
They had to pump my stomach.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.798
-Was this deliberate or an accident?
-Kind of both.

23:08.972 --> 23:12.385
It's not what you think. It's not like
I ever wanted to commit suicide.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.801
-I took them in front of someone.
-Who?

23:15.979 --> 23:19.016
-|'|| bet you $100 she's telling the truth.
-No way.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.727
-Two hundred?
-It's your money.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.692
I had this boyfriend, Ronnie.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.654
-I was so young, and he....
-Was cheating.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.734
I was such an idiot.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.619
Feel you wanna hurt yourself now?

23:36.040 --> 23:38.372
Now that your husband has left?

23:39.252 --> 23:41.334
Maybe, yeah.

23:41.504 --> 23:42.914
But you're angry at him.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.955
I'd kill him.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.877
I mean, I would never kill him.
That's not what I meant. It'sjust a--

23:51.055 --> 23:52.670
Figure of speech. I understand.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.055
What's his name?

23:57.228 --> 23:58.217
Tom.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.011
His name was Tom.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.807
And if you caught Tom cheating,
if you walked in on him, and you could....

24:03.985 --> 24:06.601
Kill him? I'd never.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.488
But if you could do anything
and get away with it, what would it be?

24:10.658 --> 24:12.774
No chance of ever getting caught?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.692
You're above the law. Have at him.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.704
I'd chain him up.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.656
Yeah?

24:19.834 --> 24:23.952
And I'd force him to tell me
about all the lies...

24:24.130 --> 24:25.631
...the secrets he kept.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.044
I'd make him my prisoner.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.593
It's pretty messed up, huh?

24:34.265 --> 24:35.471
You know...

24:36.351 --> 24:38.933
...we don't put people in prison
for how they feel.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.388
You can't control it.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.138
You are who you are.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.931
It's biology.

24:45.109 --> 24:48.977
We never argue about height
or eye color.

24:49.155 --> 24:54.821
But try telling someone
their reaction to anger or love...

24:54.994 --> 24:57.986
...or violence is baked in.

25:00.708 --> 25:04.451
Now, it says here that your parents died
when you were 4.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.371
-What do you remember about them?
-Nothing, really.

25:07.548 --> 25:11.257
Perhaps if you did, it would be easier
for you to accept who you are.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.638
Like the sins of the father. Is that it?

25:18.309 --> 25:21.221
Absolutely. The more time you spend
with your parents...

25:21.396 --> 25:26.231
...the more of yourself you see in them.
They're a glimpse into your future.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.767
Oh, he must belong to someone.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.653
Maybe we can see if he has a chip
or something, see who his owners are.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.782
If he doesn't have any,
we could bring him back to Philadelphia.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.572
We can't go back.

25:39.831 --> 25:43.073
-What? We already decided.
-No.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.165
If there's any chance
you're in danger...

25:48.339 --> 25:52.252
...I couldn't live with myself
if something were to happen to you.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.383
You did this. You threatened him.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.887
-You threatened his girls.
-No, this had nothing to do with him.

25:58.057 --> 26:03.142
This is about us,
what's best for us, for you.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.767
That's all that matters.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.479
My father died in a fire. I was 4.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.644
Is that how you got the scar
on your hand?

26:12.822 --> 26:14.312
Yeah.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.989
I guess. I don't remember, actually.

26:20.163 --> 26:25.829
Early trauma scars us in ways
we don't often recognize or admit.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.708
You think I don't want to remember?

26:29.130 --> 26:33.669
Look, Angela, I am here to determine
whether you are a danger...

26:33.843 --> 26:36.129
...to yourself or others.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.762
I know that you don't want
to spend the night here.

26:39.932 --> 26:44.801
So I am going to see
if I can expedite the blood tests.

26:44.979 --> 26:49.348
Meanwhile, I would like you
to take a simple personality test...

26:49.525 --> 26:51.026
...I developed for patients.

26:51.194 --> 26:54.152
It's a standardized psychometric test.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.859
That's gonna give me
a deeper understanding...

26:57.033 --> 27:01.276
...into issues you may or may not have.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.660
When the nurse drew my blood, she said
that you ordered a genetic screening.

27:07.877 --> 27:12.246
Too many of my colleagues focus
on the nurture side of the equation.

27:12.423 --> 27:15.290
And, sure, how your parents
treated you is important...

27:15.468 --> 27:19.006
...but the genes they passed on
matter more.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.137
There are no wrong answers.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.765
Just whatever comes to mind.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.534
Okay, got it. Go.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.238
Hold down power, shift, S.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.370
Okay. I see white letters
on a black screen.

27:46.541 --> 27:49.829
Perfect. Okay.
Type fonrvard slash, B, N.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.379
Running a dictionary attack.
Take a few seconds.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.913
-Got it.
-Okay, it's gonna give you a password.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.922
I need you to write it down.

28:01.556 --> 28:04.172
Seven, three....

28:04.809 --> 28:06.049
A few more characters.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.410
The blood panels won 't be done
for another 20 minutes.

28:26.581 --> 28:27.787
Okay.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.300
Did you really think you could just...

28:43.681 --> 28:46.263
...come in here...

28:46.434 --> 28:47.640
...Iie to me?

28:47.810 --> 28:50.096
-That's no good.
-I know why you're here.

28:50.271 --> 28:52.262
I told you, I need your help.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.354
You...

28:55.484 --> 28:56.860
...are a junkie.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.518
You're trying to forge scrips.

28:58.696 --> 29:02.314
-Maybe my father was an addict too.
-Hand them over! Now!

29:02.491 --> 29:04.618
-Let's go.
-They're under here somewhere.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.359
Okay, got them.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.619
Are you gonna call the cops
or something?

29:10.333 --> 29:11.618
No.

29:11.792 --> 29:15.410
Now I'm only more interested
in your test results.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.041
Please continue.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.094
-Oh, my God.
-You okay?

29:27.058 --> 29:30.471
-You didn't get the password.
-I mean, what do you expect?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.187
Of course I got it.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.804
Magic.

30:36.752 --> 30:41.121
Okay, there has got to be 70,
100 files here from Creel's laptop.

30:41.298 --> 30:44.165
He was documenting them,
searching for the perfect candidates.

30:44.343 --> 30:49.053
Hold on. Wait. I have got
a hidden subdirectory here, 12 patients.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.264
The killers. Everyone in this file
has murdered someone.

30:52.435 --> 30:55.097
Except one, Duncan Prince.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.807
He must be next.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.846
-Where do we find him?
-Hold on.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.107
Got an address in College Park.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.235
Hey. Hey!

31:05.573 --> 31:08.986
-What? What the hell?
-Duncan Prince, where is he?!

31:09.744 --> 31:13.783
Okay, folks, the community forum
will be starting in 15 minutes.

31:13.956 --> 31:17.323
Everyone who'd like to make a comment
will have an opportunity to do so.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.708
Microphones are at either end
of the aisles.

31:19.879 --> 31:22.586
Why don't we go ahead
and start forming two lines?

31:25.259 --> 31:27.466
We've looked
at every conceivable database.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.844
-Nothing on Amber Deveraux.
-I don't know who he's been talking to...

31:31.015 --> 31:33.882
...but this Amber Deveraux
just crushed the kid an hour ago.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.140
Ressler.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.769
Kid's gacked up and gone. The stoner
roommates have no idea where.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.399
This girl's in trouble.
You gotta find her.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.154
Amber Deveraux doesn't exist.
That's how he's triggering his clients.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.657
-Anonymous allegations never verified.
-Poor reviews online...

31:51.827 --> 31:54.443
-...accusations at work.
-Girlfriends who don't exist.

31:54.622 --> 31:57.159
You think he's catfishing,
that he invented the girl...

31:57.333 --> 32:00.075
...to trigger Duncan Prince,
push him over the edge?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.584
Find out where he thinks she is.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.248
Many of the random acts of violence
we're here to discuss today...

32:07.426 --> 32:10.338
...are perpetrated by people
with the warrior gene.

32:10.513 --> 32:13.175
I believe the solution
to the issue of violent crime...

32:13.349 --> 32:15.806
...in this country begins
with genetic screening.

32:15.976 --> 32:19.059
Dr. Creel, we have a packed schedule,
so if you have a question....

32:19.230 --> 32:21.767
People with the warrior gene
can be triggered.

32:21.941 --> 32:27.231
I have identified what those triggers are,
and when they occur, it's not their fault.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.362
-My research shows--
-A question, please.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.819
Prince's fake girlfriend
posted a real photo...

32:32.993 --> 32:35.735
...from a community forum
on gun violence.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.198
Duncan must have seen this.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.453
Senator Sheridan.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.831
That's where our shooter's going.
The gun rally.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.538
Creel posted the photo.
He's gonna be there...

32:43.712 --> 32:45.794
...observing his experiment.

32:47.133 --> 32:53.424
Senator, it is all right here,
seven years of research.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.510
These killings can be prevented.

32:57.560 --> 33:02.270
I want the world to know
that what happens today, what I do...

33:02.439 --> 33:04.851
...is because of Amber.

33:05.401 --> 33:09.770
Because she lied to me,
because she's a cheat.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.484
Goodbye, Amber.

33:13.742 --> 33:20.033
In my system, it will require children
to be screened for the MA O-A2R gene.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.949
Kids will be labeled.
We'll target them. It will cost--

33:23.127 --> 33:26.665
I promise you, Dr. Creel,
your research will be reviewed.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.830
Reviewed. Studied.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.756
You don ’t return my calls.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.508
You refuse to see me
when I come up to your ofﬁce.

33:33.679 --> 33:37.297
And when one of these incidents
happens, you do nothing!

33:37.474 --> 33:42.343
I have been the leading voice in
Congress on mental health for 20 years.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.309
How many more of these mass killings
do we have now than we did then?

33:46.483 --> 33:49.099
We have the science.
I can stop these killings...

33:49.278 --> 33:52.862
...and you want to reject me?
You wanna reject the science?

33:58.245 --> 34:01.328
Get out of here! Get out of here!

34:02.708 --> 34:05.165
-Where is she?!
-She's not here, Duncan.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.292
-Amber's not here.
-What are you--?

34:07.463 --> 34:09.169
-I'm the one you're looking for.
-She led me on.

34:09.340 --> 34:12.673
Amber didn't do anything
because she doesn't exist, I created her.

34:14.845 --> 34:17.131
-You're here to kill me.
-What are you talking about?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.422
"I didn't mean to hurt you."
"Whatever."

34:19.850 --> 34:22.466
"Here to talk with Paul?"

34:22.978 --> 34:26.937
"He's a great guy, really." "IDGAS."
Why do you think you never met her?

34:27.107 --> 34:29.143
Because she's not real.

34:29.318 --> 34:34.187
The pictures she posted, the one
that brought you here, I posted it.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.237
That's right. Pull the trigger.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.947
Duncan, no! Listen to me.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.327
-You.
-Put the gun down.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.738
You don't wanna do this.

34:43.916 --> 34:47.079
He lied to you, manipulated you.
It's not your fault.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.962
Pull the trigger. It's what you came to do.
You're all part of my experiment.

34:51.131 --> 34:53.964
-Read my research! We can save them!
-Duncan, listen to me.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.341
He's making you believe
you don't have a choice.

34:56.512 --> 34:59.595
Do you think I wanna die? I don't.
But I have run out of ways...

34:59.765 --> 35:03.849
...to get people to pay attention.
Do this, and the world will listen.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.635
They'll examine my life, my research.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.975
That can't happen
unless you pull the trigger.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.025
Shots fired! Shots fired!

35:14.196 --> 35:16.357
Medic! I need a medic!

35:20.035 --> 35:21.070
Take it easy, pal.

35:27.084 --> 35:30.076
Creel, listen to me.
If I have a shot, I'm gonna take it.

35:30.254 --> 35:33.417
-Put your weapon down!
-I shoot her, you shoot me.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.548
-That's how this works, right?
-Make you a martyr? Not today.

35:36.719 --> 35:40.132
You should know, I saw your test results.
You know what they said?

35:41.890 --> 35:44.848
Where did it come from?
Where the hell did that shot come from?!

35:45.602 --> 35:47.513
There, on the roof. Go!

35:53.235 --> 35:56.022
I received everything Creel had on file
at the hospital...

35:56.196 --> 35:59.780
...patient records, test results,
including yours.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.948
We logged everything else
into evidence, but I thought...

36:05.122 --> 36:07.909
...perhaps you would want that.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.658
It's probably meaningless, right?

36:11.295 --> 36:13.286
Do you think Reddington
could have known...

36:13.464 --> 36:16.501
...when he gave you this case,
that you'd find out?

36:18.385 --> 36:20.216
What do I know?

36:26.810 --> 36:29.187
You were right about Keen.

36:29.605 --> 36:32.722
-She was making it all up.
-I knew it.

36:33.233 --> 36:36.725
Walt's favorite shrimp
is calling my name.

36:38.572 --> 36:39.607
Winner buys?

36:41.283 --> 36:42.739
See you tomorrow.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.652
Hey.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.409
Hey.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.700
I followed up on Frank
and Naomi Hyland, like you asked.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.621
Both phones are dead, so I identified
the five numbers they called the most...

36:56.799 --> 36:59.336
...to see if those people
were called from new numbers.

36:59.510 --> 37:02.377
People that Frank and Naomi
might have reached out to.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.090
-And?
-There's a woman.

37:04.431 --> 37:08.549
Monica Lyons.
She got six calls today, all unanswered.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.810
All came from a pay phone
at a gas station in rural Maryland.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.347
-Only a handful of homes in that area.
-What gas station?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.060
Hello, Mrs. Hyland.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.116
Does Raymond know you're here?

37:23.700 --> 37:27.488
No. He doesn't want us to talk.

37:44.721 --> 37:48.714
I'm sorry. I just-- I have a ton of questions
in this notebook about the case.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.804
But truth is, I didn't come here
just to ask you about Berlin.

37:51.979 --> 37:54.265
You have questions about the past.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.646
Yes.

37:59.903 --> 38:04.772
The day Raymond Reddington walked
into my life, everything changed.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.574
Everything I believed about.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.618
You were married to the man.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.620
You had a life, a child.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.247
-Jennifer.
-Yeah?

38:14.418 --> 38:17.581
-Why doesn't he want me to see you?
-You tell me.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.211
I think it might be
because you know something...

38:20.382 --> 38:22.498
...about how the two of us
might be connected.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.292
He wants something from you.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.298
It's a game. It's a manipulation.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.505
He's made you feel a connection...

38:29.683 --> 38:33.676
...that makes you feel
like you matter somehow.

38:33.854 --> 38:36.140
There's no one who can make
a woman feel like...

38:36.315 --> 38:39.182
...the center of his universe
more than Raymond Reddington.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.065
I'll tell you this, though.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.355
He's not who you think he is.

38:46.533 --> 38:47.909
What does he want from me?

38:51.038 --> 38:52.903
Well, look at the two of you.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.039
I should have brought a bottle
of chardonnay.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.246
I have your papers. Dembe's outside.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.207
He'll need your signature
on some of the documents.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.997
Frank is gonna pack the car.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.433
Agent Keen.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.934
I hope you had
an illuminating conversation.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.349
I don't know where Jennifer is.

39:53.517 --> 39:57.851
She knew you would come for her
one day, and she left

39:59.731 --> 40:02.188
I don't know where she is.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.229
If you need anything...

40:09.491 --> 40:11.197
...ever....

40:32.097 --> 40:33.428
When are you gonna tell her?

40:51.575 --> 40:55.159
-So how'd your case go?
-I think you know the answer to that.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.155
Who is he?

41:03.962 --> 41:07.204
-He works for you, doesn't he?
-Yes.

41:08.592 --> 41:11.334
How long has he been following me?

41:13.889 --> 41:17.052
Since the day Agent Malik died.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.304
I want him gone.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.562
My associate saves your life...

41:24.733 --> 41:27.770
...and instead of saying "thank you,"
you try to get him fired.

41:27.944 --> 41:31.732
If I knew better,
I'd say you were hiding something.
