00:03.900 --> 00:06.200
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.200 --> 00:09.833
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP IS ONE
OF MY PRIMARY FOCUSES, THOUGH.

00:09.833 --> 00:13.633
IS THIS A SOUL MATE
OR A SEXUAL MATE?

00:13.633 --> 00:15.167
GRANDMA!

00:15.167 --> 00:16.567
It's possible that Dr. Ting

00:16.567 --> 00:19.200
is gonna recommend
the tissue expander.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.533
WE'RE AT THE AIRPORT,

00:20.533 --> 00:23.167
ON OUR WAY TO MEET DR. TING
IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:23.167 --> 00:26.833
THIS CONSULTATION IS, LIKE...
UGH, AND I'M JUST NOT READY.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.267
I'M SCARED.

00:28.267 --> 00:31.067
ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO IS
WE CAN PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER,

00:31.067 --> 00:32.667
WHICH IS A SKIN STRETCHER.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.567
IN THE SCROTUM, AS IT BLOWS UP,
IT STRETCHES THE SKIN,

00:35.567 --> 00:37.233
AND THAT CAN CREATE
NEW SKIN.

00:37.233 --> 00:39.267
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.300
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

00:44.300 --> 00:46.900
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.367
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.767
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY...

00:51.767 --> 00:54.000
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.067
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

00:56.067 --> 00:57.200
-COME ON, JAZZ!
-WHOO!

00:57.200 --> 00:59.600
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

00:59.600 --> 01:01.733
...BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:01.733 --> 01:03.167
I AM JAZZ.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.467
Man: OKAY. SO WE'LL, UH,
WE'LL SEE YOU UPSTAIRS. OKAY?

01:14.467 --> 01:19.100
IT'S POST-EXAM TIME,
AND THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME

01:19.100 --> 01:21.433
BECAUSE I AM WORRIED
THAT DR. TING WILL SAY

01:21.433 --> 01:23.300
THAT I DO NEED
THE TISSUE EXPANDER.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.233
AS FAR AS A TISSUE EXPANDER
IS CONCERNED...

01:28.233 --> 01:29.600
MM

01:32.067 --> 01:33.633
...YOU JUST --
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

01:33.633 --> 01:34.933
-YES!

01:34.933 --> 01:37.067
YOU SCARED ME THERE
FOR A SECOND.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.500
-YAY.
-HIGH FIVE!

01:38.500 --> 01:40.133
-WHOO!

01:40.133 --> 01:41.400
I THINK YOU'D BE
A GREAT CANDIDATE

01:41.400 --> 01:43.633
FOR USING THE PERITONEUM
AND A SKIN GRAFT

01:43.633 --> 01:44.900
FROM THE GROIN.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.600
-MY DREAMS JUST CAME TRUE.
-YAY!

01:47.600 --> 01:50.633
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
KNOWING THAT I DO NOT NEED

01:50.633 --> 01:52.367
THE TISSUE EXPANDER.

01:52.367 --> 01:55.133
HAVING THAT BALLOON
BETWEEN MY LEGS, JUST...

01:55.133 --> 01:56.700
NO, HONEY, NO.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.233
AND NOW I COULD JUST
COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT IT.

01:59.233 --> 02:02.067
I MEAN, NOW, IF YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU REALLY WANTED

02:02.067 --> 02:04.067
TO HAVE A TISSUE EXPANDER...
-OH, HELL TO THE NO.

02:04.067 --> 02:05.400
-OKAY.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.500
SHE HAS ENOUGH SKIN
IN THE SCROTUM

02:07.500 --> 02:09.067
TO MAKE THE LABIA.

02:09.067 --> 02:11.900
THAT'S WHAT I WAS REALLY LOOKING
FOR, BECAUSE THE VAGINA ITSELF,

02:11.900 --> 02:13.167
I KNOW I CAN MAKE

02:13.167 --> 02:15.900
FROM THE SKIN GRAPH
AND THE PERITONEUM.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.233
WHAT ABOUT HER B.M.I.?
UM, DR. BOWERS WAS CONCERNED.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.567
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE.
WE HAVE OPERATED

02:20.567 --> 02:23.400
ON PLENTY OF PATIENTS WITH
HIGHER B.M.I.s THAN YOU.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.100
KNOWING THAT THE SURGERY
ISN'T ON THE LINE IS GOOD.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.200
I KNOW, IN HER LITTLE BRAIN,
SHE'S GOING "YES!

02:31.200 --> 02:33.167
"I CAN EAT
WHATEVER I WANT NOW,

02:33.167 --> 02:37.267
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO
THIS DIET, STARVATION."

02:37.267 --> 02:39.300
THIS IS NOT
A GOOD THING, ACTUALLY.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.700
EVERYTHING YOU SAID,
IT'S JUST, LIKE,

02:40.700 --> 02:42.967
ALL MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE.

02:42.967 --> 02:50.267
**

02:50.267 --> 02:53.367
IT'S A NICE...
NOT-SO-SUNNY DAY.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.767
Jazz: LOOK OVER THERE.
LOOK OVER THERE.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.533
Greg: THE TWINS
WOULD CALL THAT HOT YOGA.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.100
-OH.
-I SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.433
Ari: HELLO!

03:00.433 --> 03:02.267
Greg: WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE
DID YOU GUYS GET INTO?

03:02.267 --> 03:04.667
WE DID EVERYTHING. WE'VE SEEN
EVERYTHING TO SEE IN NEW YORK.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.133
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE BUSY
AT THE DOCTOR, THOUGH,

03:06.133 --> 03:07.300
WE WERE EATING AND EATING

03:07.300 --> 03:08.667
AND EATING AND EATING
AND EATING.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.767
I THINK OUR FAMILY HAS
AN EATING PROBLEM.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.833
-Jazz: ME, ESPECIALLY.
-WE JUST ALL EAT TOO MUCH.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.267
-WE'RE FOODIES.
-Ari: WE LIVE TO EAT.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.467
SO HOW DID THE CONSULTATION GO?

03:16.467 --> 03:19.433
IT ACTUALLY WENT REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY WELL.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.067
I DO NOT NEED
A TISSUE EXPANDER.

03:22.067 --> 03:25.667
HE ALSO SAID THAT I COULD
GET THE PERITONEUM PROCEDURE.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.900
LIKE, I'M
A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR IT.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.600
I'M VERY RELIEVED TO HEAR JAZZ
DOES NOT NEED A TISSUE EXPANDER

03:30.600 --> 03:33.100
BECAUSE JAZZ WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO WORK OUT THAT MUCH,

03:33.100 --> 03:34.267
AND IF SHE WANTS
TO LOSE WEIGHT,

03:34.267 --> 03:36.533
SHE NEEDS TO WORK OUT
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.867
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WITH ALL SAID AND DONE,

03:37.867 --> 03:40.067
WE STILL HAVE TO GO BACK
AND TALK TO MARCI.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:41.333 --> 03:42.667
UNTIL WE HAVE A DATE SET,
I'M NOT GONNA BE, LIKE,

03:42.667 --> 03:45.467
COMPLETELY RELAXED
AND FEEL LIKE WE'RE THERE YET.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.967
-TOO MUCH VAGINA TALK.
-Greg: I THINK SANDER'S RIGHT.

03:47.967 --> 03:49.467
WHY DON'T WE GO FOR A RIDE
ON THE CAROUSEL?

03:49.467 --> 03:51.567
UH, CAN WE GO ON THE CAROUSEL?
I WANT TO GO ON THE CAROUSEL.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.067
TIRED OF VAGINAS.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.767
* TIRED OF VAGINAS *

03:55.767 --> 03:59.900
WE'RE SO RELIEVED THAT DR. TING
IS THE FINAL CONSULTATION

03:59.900 --> 04:02.300
WE HAVE TO GO TO
FOR JAZZ'S BOTTOM SURGERY.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.200
AND NOW WE HAVE
A GAME PLAN,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.167
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF GETTING A DATE

04:06.167 --> 04:07.500
AND MOVING FORWARD AND --

04:07.500 --> 04:08.800
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WE THOUGHT LAST YEAR.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.200
I'M DONE.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.933
IMAGINE JAZZ DOING THIS
WITH THE TISSUE EXPANDER IN.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.133
-Ari: OH, MY GOD.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.367
-STOP.
-Greg: THAT'S A LOVELY THOUGHT.

04:16.367 --> 04:19.800
-IT WOULD BURST.
-Greg: GIDDYAP.

04:19.800 --> 04:28.667
**

04:28.733 --> 04:33.667
**

04:35.733 --> 04:37.600
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.133
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY THAT
I HAVEN'T HUNG OUT WITH YOU

04:40.133 --> 04:43.133
SINCE WE...WENT TO
THE PIZZA SHOP, YEAH.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.567
WERE AT THE PIZZA PLACE,
YEAH, AND I KNOW

04:44.567 --> 04:47.167
THE KIDS ARE ON THEIR WAY,
SO THEY SHOULD BE HERE SOON.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.867
Jazz:
I'M MEETING UP WITH MICHAELA

04:48.867 --> 04:51.533
AND MY FRIENDS FROM THE MIXER
AT THIS POTTERY CRAFT STORE.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.700
-EXCUSE ME.
-YEAH.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY
METALLIC COLORS OR NO?

04:54.200 --> 04:57.700
-I SHOULD HAVE GOLD AND SILVER.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.800
YAY.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.067
PAINTING TOGETHER
IS A GOOD WAY TO BOND

05:00.067 --> 05:02.367
BECAUSE IT'S RELAXING,
ENJOYABLE.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.133
YOU JUST GET TO DO
YOUR OWN THING.

05:04.133 --> 05:06.633
YOU COULD PAINT AND TALK
AT THE SAME TIME,

05:06.633 --> 05:10.067
AND IT'S JUST REALLY...
IT'S A FUN EXPERIENCE.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.500
SO HOW'S YOUR TRANSITION
BEEN GOING?

05:12.500 --> 05:15.633
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, I'M KIND OF
AT THE SURGERY STEP.

05:15.633 --> 05:16.867
MM-HMM.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.067
SO I DID JUST GO ON
A FAMILY TRIP TO NEW YORK

05:19.067 --> 05:21.100
'CAUSE I HAD
A DOCTOR APPOINTMENT THERE.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.067
THAT'S...BEEN FUN.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.200
DEFINITELY
A BIG PROCEDURE.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.633
-MM-HMM.
-AND I'M EXCITED FOR IT.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.067
I'VE BEEN WANTING IT
MY WHOLE LIFE,

05:31.067 --> 05:32.333
AND I KNOW THAT
I'M READY FOR IT,

05:32.333 --> 05:34.067
SO I TRY
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT

05:34.067 --> 05:35.700
'CAUSE I THINK ABOUT IT
SO MUCH WHEN IT...

05:35.700 --> 05:38.200
YEAH.  I'M SURE. YEAH.
...WHEN I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT

05:38.200 --> 05:39.567
OR WHEN I'M AT, LIKE,
A CONSULTATION.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.700
DEFINITELY.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.100
I JUST REALIZED YOU'RE
PAINTING YOUR PINEAPPLE TEAL.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.500
-HEY.
-TEAL IS A PRETTY COLOR.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.133
SHE CAN BE
A NONBINARY PINEAPPLE.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.967
SHE CAN BE ANY COLOR
SHE WANTS TO BE.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.567
MICHAELA, HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND?

05:53.567 --> 05:55.067
THEY'RE GOING REALLY WELL.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.700
YOU KISS ENOUGH FROGS, AND YOU
EVENTUALLY FIND A PRINCE, RIGHT?

05:57.700 --> 05:58.900
Evan: YEAH.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.333
ANYBODY ELSE ELSE HAVE
ANYTHING EXCITING AND NEW

06:00.333 --> 06:02.167
GOING ON WITH RELATIONSHIPS?

06:02.167 --> 06:04.700
NOT YET, REALLY, YET.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.500
NOT YET. I'M LETTING --
LETTING THINGS COME TO ME.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.833
ESPECIALLY BEING TRANSGENDER,

06:08.833 --> 06:11.567
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALMOST
NOT AS EASY FOR,

06:11.567 --> 06:13.600
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE
ME AND JAZZ.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.600
I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE A LOT
EASIER FOR US TO FIND A PARTNER

06:16.600 --> 06:20.533
IF WE HAD IT AS THE HEART,
NOT THE PART.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.300
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S
BETWEEN THE LEGS.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.400
I KIND OF CARE WHAT MORE
IS IN THE HEART.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.967
IT'S JUST ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

06:25.967 --> 06:27.600
WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE
THAT COUNTS.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.300
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WE'RE
JUST A CONFUSED GAY PERSON,

06:31.300 --> 06:34.433
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIMES.

06:34.433 --> 06:35.600
THAT'S TRUE.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.133
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD
BE LOOKING FOR

06:37.133 --> 06:40.667
IN SOMEBODY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
TO EXPLORE A RELATIONSHIP WITH?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.933
I FEEL LIKE INTELLECT
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME.

06:42.933 --> 06:45.967
LIKE, I LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS
SMART AND WHO COULD, LIKE,

06:45.967 --> 06:47.367
SPEAK WITH ME
ON THAT LEVEL 'CAUSE...

06:47.367 --> 06:48.633
YEAH. I TOTALLY AGREE.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.133
...I MEAN, I DON'T HATE YOU
IF YOU'RE DUMB.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.633
-WE CAN BE FRIENDS AND STUFF,

06:51.633 --> 06:53.567
BUT WE JUST -- WE CAN'T
GO BEYOND THAT.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.200
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
THAT WAS REALLY BAD.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.467
I KNOW.
THAT SOUNDED REALLY BAD.

06:56.467 --> 06:59.300
YOUR I.Q. HAS TO BE AT LEAST,
LIKE, 130 TO TALK TO ME.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.867
Jazz: NO, NO, NO.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.567
IT'S MORE JUST, LIKE, AS LONG
AS THEY CAN UNDERSTAND, LIKE...

07:02.567 --> 07:03.800
-YEAH, OF COURSE.
-AS LONG AS YOU CAN HAVE

07:03.800 --> 07:05.100
AN INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION
WITH SOMEONE...

07:05.100 --> 07:06.267
EXACTLY.
Jazz: I'M JUST A COMPLEX PERSON.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.867
IF I LIMIT IT
TO FIVE QUALITIES,

07:07.867 --> 07:10.433
I WOULD SAY
INTELLIGENT, KINDNESS,

07:10.433 --> 07:12.200
FLEXIBLE, FUN,

07:12.200 --> 07:14.800
LOVING, AND CONFID--
THAT'S SIX. ALL RIGHT.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.300
SO, IF Y'ALL KNOW
ANYBODY LIKE THAT,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.867
LET ME KNOW, BOY, GIRL,
OR IN THE IN-BETWEEN.

07:19.867 --> 07:23.267
Jazz: I IDENTIFY AS PANSEXUAL,
AND BEING PANSEXUAL MEANS

07:23.267 --> 07:27.567
THAT YOU LOVE AN INDIVIDUAL
FOR THEIR PERSONALITY AND SOUL.

07:27.567 --> 07:30.133
NO MATTER THEIR LABEL,
THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION,

07:30.133 --> 07:32.833
GENDER IDENTITY, YOU KNOW,
ANYTHING, REALLY,

07:32.833 --> 07:35.300
RACE, RELIGION,
WHATEVER THEY ARE,

07:35.300 --> 07:38.833
YOU LOVE SOMEONE FOR THEIR HEART
AND WHO THEY ARE ON THE INSIDE.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.467
Evan: I ALWAYS HEAR, LIKE,
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY

07:40.467 --> 07:43.233
THAT PANSEXUALITY IS, LIKE,

07:43.233 --> 07:46.267
A GLORIFIED, LIKE,
PERSON WHO IS BISEXUAL.

07:46.267 --> 07:47.700
-WHATEVER.
-UGH.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.667
WE'RE LITTLE FLOATING NOODLES
WHO LOVE EVERYBODY.

07:49.667 --> 07:50.867
-WE'RE FLOATING NOODLES.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.333
-YEAH.
-NOODLES.

07:52.333 --> 07:56.500
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEBODY'S SOUL FIRST.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.700
-Evan: YEAH.
-Jax: TRUE.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.867
BUT IT'S OKAY
IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

07:58.867 --> 08:01.367
OH, YEAH. OH, HECK, YEAH.

08:01.367 --> 08:03.267
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO PAY IT FORWARD.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.900
WHAT

08:05.900 --> 08:08.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:08.333 --> 08:11.067
Michaela: I THINK I CAN
INTRODUCE JAZZ

08:11.067 --> 08:12.800
TO PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

08:12.800 --> 08:15.067
THAT MAY BE
GOOD FRIENDS FOR HER,

08:15.067 --> 08:17.067
GOOD POTENTIAL PARTNERS FOR HER.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.533
I KIND OF WANT TO, LIKE,
THROW IT AND CATCH IT.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.100
-I TRIPLE-DOG DARE YOU.
-I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.533
-OH!

08:23.533 --> 08:26.067
YAY!

08:26.067 --> 08:29.067
-ALL RIGHT. YOU DID IT.
-CAME OUT GREAT.

08:29.067 --> 08:35.067
**

08:35.067 --> 08:36.133
WHO WOULD
TAKE A BITE OF BANANA

08:36.133 --> 08:37.633
AND THEN JUST SHOVE IT
BACK SOMEWHERE?

08:37.633 --> 08:40.667
SOMEBODY WHO JUST WANTED
A BITE OF A BANANA.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.333
I REALLY TRIED
TO GET IT IN.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.833
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS?

08:44.833 --> 08:47.500
AND LET'S SEE IF ANYBODY WALKS
IN AND SLIPS ON THE BANANA PEEL.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.933
THE GIRL WITH THE BLANKET PANTS.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.267
WHAT, YOU JUST WAKE UP
FROM A NAP?

08:52.267 --> 08:54.300
SHE WEARS BALL GOWNS NOW
INTO THE KITCHEN.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.900
I CAME DOWN HERE
'CAUSE AREN'T WE SUPPOSED

08:55.900 --> 08:58.067
TO CALL MARCI BOWERS OR...
-WE ARE.

08:58.067 --> 09:00.067
WE'RE CALLING MARCI BOWERS
TO JUST TELL HER

09:00.067 --> 09:02.433
HOW MY CONSULTATION WENT
WITH DR. TING.

09:03.567 --> 09:04.800
-OH, IT CONNECTS TO US.
-IT'S CONNECTING.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.400
AND NOW I JUST NEED
TWO THERAPY LETTERS,

09:07.400 --> 09:10.700
AND I NEED TO SET A DATE
FOR THE PROCEDURE.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.333
-Hey.
-Jazz: HELLO.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.067
Jeanette: LOOK AT THAT
GORGEOUS WOMAN ON OUR SCREEN.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.433
Oh, my God!

09:17.433 --> 09:19.433
So I'm anxious to hear.
How did it go with Dr. Ting?

09:19.433 --> 09:21.733
-IT WENT VERY, VERY WELL.
-Great.

09:21.733 --> 09:26.733
HE TOLD US THAT WE DO NOT NEED
THE TISSUE EXPANDER.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.567
What did he think about
the amount of skin

09:28.567 --> 09:29.800
that you had, though?

09:29.800 --> 09:34.200
HE BASICALLY SAID
MY PROPORTIONS WERE PERFECT

09:34.200 --> 09:38.133
FOR WHAT HE ENVISIONS THAT
A FEMALE VAGINA WOULD LOOK LIKE.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.300
Well, let me ask you.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.900
How are you feeling
about therapy?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.900
Are you working on the letters?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.467
FIRST PERSON WILL BE DR. VOLKER,
BUT SHE HAS TO GO TO HER.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.333
SHE HASN'T BEEN WITH HER
FOR AWHILE.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.200
IT'S GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.067
WELL, I HAVE BEEN RESISTANT
TO THERAPY IN THE PAST.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.400
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
A NITTY-GRITTY
REAL THERAPY SESSION,

09:55.400 --> 09:56.733
BUT RATHER SOMETHING LIKE,

09:56.733 --> 09:58.733
"OKAY, YOU'RE TRANSGENDER,
RIGHT, GIRL?

09:58.733 --> 10:01.167
"LIKE, YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE A WOMAN.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.200
"YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AS A WOMAN.
YOU ARE A WOMAN,"

10:03.200 --> 10:06.900
AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE...
BOOM, DONE, YAY.

10:06.900 --> 10:10.700
DR. BOWERS, ONE THING THAT
DR. TING SAID WAS THAT

10:10.700 --> 10:16.333
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT THE B.M.I.
WAS AS BIG AS AN ISSUE.

10:16.333 --> 10:19.600
While I agree, technically,
it's possible,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.600
from a complication standpoint,

10:21.600 --> 10:24.733
you want to be on the lower end
of the B.M.I. scale.

10:24.733 --> 10:27.033
Keep in mind who is doing
your surgery.

10:27.033 --> 10:29.967
HE DID MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT YOU
ARE THE MASTER SURGEON, THOUGH.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.700
If it's really not right,
the date doesn't get set,

10:32.700 --> 10:35.133
so don't forget that.

10:35.133 --> 10:38.100
I FEEL TERRIBLE KNOWING
THAT THERE'S NO EASY WAY

10:38.100 --> 10:40.533
TO HANDLE
THIS WEIGHT LOSS THING.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.133
TWO SURGEONS ARE SAYING
DIFFERENT THINGS

10:42.133 --> 10:43.667
ABOUT MY B.M.I.,

10:43.667 --> 10:47.633
AND IT KIND OF JUST FEELS LIKE
I'M BACK TO WHERE I STARTED.

10:47.633 --> 10:50.467
Plus I want to see Jazz heading
in the right direction.

10:50.467 --> 10:51.967
Jeanette: MM-HMM.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.267
JAZZ NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT

10:53.267 --> 10:55.633
BECAUSE IT PHYSICALLY
CAN COMPROMISE

10:55.633 --> 10:58.033
THE RESULTS OF SURGERY
FROM BLOOD FLOW.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.100
AND IF SHE'S NOT
AN IDEAL CANDIDATE,

11:00.100 --> 11:01.633
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT

11:01.633 --> 11:04.533
TO GET APPROVAL FOR HER,
AS AN ADOLESCENT,

11:04.533 --> 11:07.067
TO HAVE SURGERY
BEFORE THE AGE OF 18.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.067
NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.167
I want her to be
in the best possible shape.

11:12.167 --> 11:15.600
JAZZ KNOWS THE SEVERITY
OF THIS ISSUE,

11:15.600 --> 11:17.600
BUT SOMETIMES
SHE PROCRASTINATES.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.967
-TAKE CARE. MWAH! BYE!
-BE WELL.

11:19.967 --> 11:24.567
I DON'T THINK JAZZ THINKS THAT
SHE NEEDS TO LOSE THE WEIGHT

11:24.567 --> 11:28.800
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME
BECAUSE SURGERY, FOR EXAMPLE,

11:28.800 --> 11:32.167
IS PRETTY FAR OFF
IN THE HORIZON.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.267
-WHATEVER.
-YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

11:33.267 --> 11:34.633
THIS IS JUST BACK
TO WHERE WE STARTED,

11:34.633 --> 11:36.367
SO I GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK
AT IT THAT WAY.

11:36.367 --> 11:39.133
LOOK AT IT AS A GOOD THING,
NOT A BAD THING.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.433
IT'S JUST A LOT OF ADDED STRESS
TO LOSE THIS WEIGHT,

11:42.433 --> 11:46.100
AND I WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, EASY AND FUN FOR ME.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.200
HOWEVER IT'S BECOME SO SERIOUS

11:48.200 --> 11:50.667
KNOWING THAT THIS SURGERY
IS ON THE LINE.

11:50.667 --> 11:53.333
**

11:53.333 --> 11:55.500
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

11:55.500 --> 11:57.067
YOU WANTING TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

11:57.067 --> 11:59.400
AND I HAPPENED TO MEET
A GIRL

11:59.400 --> 12:02.200
WHO I THINK
YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.267
WAIT. A GIRL?

12:05.267 --> 12:07.167
LET'S DO LIKE
"THE BIGGEST LOSER"
AND HAVE A WEIGH-IN,

12:07.167 --> 12:08.767
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME WHAT YOU WEIGH.

12:08.767 --> 12:10.100
YOU CAN'T SEE THE NUMBER.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.867
Jazz: IT'S KIND OF A FINE LINE
IN TERMS OF MY MOM

12:12.867 --> 12:15.233
HELPING OR HURTING ME
WITH THIS WEIGHT LOSS THING.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.767
**

12:18.433 --> 12:25.067
**

12:25.067 --> 12:28.067
Woman: LOOK PAST
YOUR RIGHT FINGERTIPS.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.367
TAKE THE LEFT HAND DOWN
THE LEFT LEG.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.067
REACH YOUR RIGHT ARM
UP AND OVER.

12:33.067 --> 12:36.100
AFTER DR. BOWERS THREW THIS
CURVEBALL ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS,

12:36.100 --> 12:39.633
I WANNA FEEL MOTIVATED TO LOSE
WEIGHT AND LOWER MY B.M.I.,

12:39.633 --> 12:43.733
SO TODAY I AM MEETING UP
WITH MY FRIENDS TO DO YOGA

12:43.733 --> 12:47.233
AND CONTINUE MY PATH OF
LOSING WEIGHT FOR THIS SURGERY.

12:47.233 --> 12:51.133
WALK YOURSELF BACK OVER
TO THAT LEFT-SIDE LUNGE,

12:51.133 --> 12:55.100
STEP IT BACK IN
TO YOUR HIGH PLANK POSE.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.900
EXHALE. PUSH BACK,
DOWNWARD FACING DOG.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.333
I THINK JAZZ HAVING THE SUPPORT
OF HER FRIENDS

13:01.333 --> 13:03.733
WHILE SHE'S TRYING TO LOSE
WEIGHT IS REALLY MOTIVATIONAL

13:03.733 --> 13:05.333
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS SHE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP

13:05.333 --> 13:07.533
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE
RIGHT BEHIND HER, PUSHING HER.

13:07.533 --> 13:11.467
AND WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL, TOO,
SO IT'S, LIKE, MORE MOTIVATION.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.833
I WENT LIKE THAT
AND IT WAS, LIKE...

13:15.833 --> 13:18.567
I KEPT DYING 'CAUSE EVERY TIME,
LIKE, I'D TURN AROUND,

13:18.567 --> 13:20.633
I'D HEAR ONE OF YOUR
BONES BREAK, LIKE...

13:20.633 --> 13:22.067
-OH.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.767
I KNOW MY BONES CRACK,
BUT NOELLE'S CRACKED MORE,

13:23.767 --> 13:24.967
I FEEL LIKE.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.533
I DON'T KNOW.
EVER SINCE I WENT TO NEW YORK,

13:26.533 --> 13:30.667
I FEEL LIKE I'VE FALLEN OFF
THE WAGON IN WEIGHT LOSS.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.333
DIDN'T YOU HAVE SOME SORT
OF DOCTOR APPOINTMENT

13:32.333 --> 13:34.067
WHILE YOU WERE THERE?
-YES.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.300
DR. TING, AND BASICALLY,
HE SAID THAT

13:36.300 --> 13:37.867
I DON'T NEED A TISSUE EXPANDER.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.700
ALL I'M GOING TO NEED
IS A SKIN GRAFT,

13:39.700 --> 13:41.933
AND THEN HE COULD USE
THE PERITONEAL LINING,

13:41.933 --> 13:44.833
AND THEY'LL DO THE INVERSION
TO CREATE MY VAGINA.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.167
IT'S EXCITING TO HEAR THAT JAZZ

13:46.167 --> 13:48.400
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO
THE TISSUE EXPANDER ANYMORE

13:48.400 --> 13:50.533
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE TENDS
TO DWELL ON THINGS,

13:50.533 --> 13:52.133
AND NOW SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT,

13:52.133 --> 13:53.833
YOU KNOW, WHAT PATH
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.367
OH, GOOD.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.400
I'M SO HAPPY YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THE EXPANDER THING...

13:56.400 --> 13:57.833
-OH, MY GOSH.
-OH, MY GOD.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.800
AND THEN I HAVE TO TUCK AND THEN
I CAN NO LONGER DO YOGA.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.300
YOU CAN DO YOGA EVEN IF
YOU HAVE TO TUCK.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.067
**

14:06.067 --> 14:08.367
WORDS FROM
AN EXPERIENCED YOGI.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.800
YEAH.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.433
TALKING ABOUT GRAPHIC STUFF
WITH JAZZ ISN'T SOMETHING NEW,

14:13.433 --> 14:15.633
SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT'S WEIRD TO US

14:15.633 --> 14:19.767
BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE
SOME SORT OF ISSUE.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.367
WE CAN ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT.

14:21.367 --> 14:24.267
WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH
OTHER, SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

14:24.267 --> 14:26.400
ARE ANY OF YOU GUYS
IN RELATIONSHIPS OR NO?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.700
-Jayleen: NO.
-NO.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.333
I HAVE NO DESIRE
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.233
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO BRANCH OUT

14:33.233 --> 14:35.533
A LITTLE BIT AND MEET PEOPLE
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED

14:35.533 --> 14:37.200
IN DATING A TRANS GIRL.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.533
I DON'T KNOW.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.533
LIKE, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ONE
TO WANT A RELATIONSHIP,

14:40.533 --> 14:42.700
SO THIS IS KINDA NEW FOR ME.
-Lainey: YEAH.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.267
IT'S ODD THAT JAZZ WANTS
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

14:44.267 --> 14:46.100
BECAUSE SHE'S NEVER BEEN
THAT TYPE OF PERSON,

14:46.100 --> 14:49.533
BUT I THINK, NOW THAT SHE'S
CLOSER TO GETTING THE SURGERY

14:49.533 --> 14:50.767
AND SHE'S WORKING OUT MORE,

14:50.767 --> 14:52.567
SHE'S STARTING TO
SEE HERSELF DIFFERENTLY.

14:52.567 --> 14:53.933
WHO SAID IT'S EVEN GONNA HAPPEN?

14:53.933 --> 14:56.433
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYONE.
AND WHO KNOWS?

14:56.433 --> 14:58.467
YEAH. I JUST REALLY WANT THIS
PERSON TO BE REALLY NICE

14:58.467 --> 15:00.833
'CAUSE IF NOT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.333
Lainey: YEAH, AND, LIKE,
TREAT YOU RIGHT. YEAH.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.800
THE THREE OF US ARE GONNA...

15:03.800 --> 15:05.433
IF THEY EVER HURT HER, THEY'RE
GOING TO WAKE UP ONE DAY

15:05.433 --> 15:07.233
AND THEY'RE GOING TO FIND, LIKE,
THREE PEOPLE AT THEIR DOOR.

15:07.233 --> 15:08.467
-YEAH.
-IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE,

15:08.467 --> 15:09.700
"I'M THE SHORT, HISPANIC,
CRAZY FRIEND

15:09.700 --> 15:12.067
"AND I'M HERE TO HURT YOU.

15:12.067 --> 15:14.233
LIKE, HELLO."

15:16.133 --> 15:24.800
**

15:24.800 --> 15:27.267
-NO. DON'T DO THAT TO ME.
-Michaela: SHE'S SO SCARED.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.633
OH, MY GOD.
I GOT A LOT OF IT ON HERE.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.133
-NO.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.400
JUST RUB. THAT'S GREAT.
I LIKE IT.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.833
-NO.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.467
IT'S ALL...YOU DIDN'T EVEN
GET THE EDGES.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.267
EVER SINCE JAZZ EXPRESSED
TO ME HOW MUCH

15:41.267 --> 15:42.600
SHE WANTS TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP

15:42.600 --> 15:44.067
AND SHE WANTS TO FIND LOVE,

15:44.067 --> 15:45.967
I'VE KIND OF BEEN ON A MISSION,

15:45.967 --> 15:48.367
TRYING TO FIND SOMEBODY
WHO WILL BE GREAT FOR JAZZ' LIFE

15:48.367 --> 15:50.167
WHETHER AS A FRIEND
OR SOMETHING MORE.

15:50.167 --> 15:53.433
I KNOW WE'VE TALKED
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU

15:53.433 --> 15:56.667
WANTING TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP
AND JUST MEETING NEW PEOPLE,

15:56.667 --> 16:00.200
AND I ACTUALLY HAPPENED
TO MEET A GIRL

16:00.200 --> 16:02.967
WHO I THINK YOU WOULD
REALLY LIKE.

16:02.967 --> 16:05.933
-HER NAME'S VICTORIA.

16:05.933 --> 16:07.300
-AND SHE'S 17,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.333
AND SHE'S PANSEXUAL.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.067
HAS SHE DATED ANYONE
BEFORE?

16:11.067 --> 16:13.367
SHE'S DATED A GIRL BEFORE.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.767
I KNOW HER FIRST KISS
WAS A GIRL.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.200
AND YOU SAID HER NAME
IS VICTORIA?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.800
-VICTORIA, YEAH.
-VICTORIA.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.333
-YES.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.933
SHE'S REALLY COOL.

16:22.933 --> 16:25.067
SHE'S SUPER "GO WITH THE FLOW,"
AND SHE DOESN'T WEAR DRESSES.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.100
OH. SHE DOESN'T
WEAR DRESSES?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.467
SHE DOESN'T WEAR DRESSES.

16:27.467 --> 16:29.967
SO SHE'S KIND OF, LIKE,
ROUGH OR NO?

16:29.967 --> 16:31.167
-NO, SHE'S...

16:31.167 --> 16:34.067
SHE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL,
LONG BRUNETTE HAIR,

16:34.067 --> 16:37.267
AND SHE PLAYS WATER POLO
BUT SHE'S NOT A JOCK.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.200
-THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.967
I WAS, LIKE, THAT'S WEIRD,
BUT I THINK

16:40.967 --> 16:45.533
SHE'S A PERFECT MIX
OF MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.367
I DEFINITELY HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF HESITATION

16:48.367 --> 16:50.067
JUST BECAUSE,IN THE PAST,

16:50.067 --> 16:54.967
I ONLY HAVE GONE OUT WITH BOYS,
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT.

16:54.967 --> 16:57.300
HAVE YOU TOLD HER ABOUT ME?
LIKE, IS SHE WILLING TO MEET ME?

16:57.300 --> 17:01.600
YEAH. SHE'S ACTUALLY WILLING
TO HANG OUT AND MEET YOU.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.067
SHE'S SUPER COOL.

17:03.067 --> 17:06.433
VICTORIA IS OPEN TO DATING
SOMEONE WHO IS TRANSGENDERED,

17:06.433 --> 17:07.967
AND THAT'S REALLY COOL.

17:07.967 --> 17:10.067
HOWEVER, I JUST NEVER HAVE

17:10.067 --> 17:12.467
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED
DATING ANYONE BUT A GUY,

17:12.467 --> 17:14.233
SO I HOPE THAT
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL,

17:14.233 --> 17:16.067
NOT LIKE SOME MEAN GIRL
WHO, LIKE...

17:16.067 --> 17:19.500
I DON'T KNOW, WHO IS MEAN,
BUT JUST SOMEONE WHO'S NICE

17:19.500 --> 17:21.300
AND FUN TO BE AROUND
AND KIND OF LIKE ME.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.967
I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD
OF MYSELF BUT, LIKE,

17:22.967 --> 17:25.233
'CAUSE THIS SOUNDS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.200
-YOU'RE SKEPTICAL.
-BUT CAN WE NOT MAKE IT, LIKE,

17:27.200 --> 17:28.700
AN AWKWARD,
LIKE, ONE

17:28.700 --> 17:30.200
GOD, NO! NO. WE'LL...

17:30.200 --> 17:32.233
LET'S JUST HAVE FUN TOGETHER,
AND THEN, LIKE, FIRST, LIKE,

17:32.233 --> 17:34.533
I'LL ASSESS HER, LIKE,
AS A FRIEND,

17:34.533 --> 17:36.067
AND THEN I WON'T
THINK OF IT THAT WAY.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.733
-GIRL, LET ME WORK MY MAGIC,

17:37.733 --> 17:41.933
AND WE'LL ALL HANG OUT.
AND...I'M EXCITED.

17:41.933 --> 17:44.700
Jazz:
WHEN IT COMES TO MATCHMAKING,
I DEFINITELY TRUST MICHAELA.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.867
I FEEL LIKE MICHAELA HAS
A GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER,

17:46.867 --> 17:49.467
SO I'M HOPING THAT
THIS PERSON THAT SHE FOUND

17:49.467 --> 17:51.567
IS REALLY A GOOD MATCH FOR ME.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.667
I KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I'VE
BEEN ON THIS ENDLESS SEARCH

17:53.667 --> 17:55.100
FOR SOMEBODY,

17:55.100 --> 17:56.700
AND THEN HERE'S MICHAELA,
MY LITTLE FAIRY GODMOTHER LIKE,

17:56.700 --> 17:58.633
"BIPPITY BOPPITY BOO,
I'VE GOT SOMEBODY FOR YOU,

17:58.633 --> 17:59.800
DOO, DOO, DOO."

17:59.800 --> 18:03.567
OH, THE WORLD IS
A MAGICAL PLACE, RIGHT?

18:03.567 --> 18:10.200
**

18:11.733 --> 18:13.833
COME IN.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.067
TA-DA!

18:15.067 --> 18:16.200
-YOU'RE IN.
-IT FITS.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.133
-TURN AROUND.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.467
I WOULDN'T SAY FLAT,
BUT AT LEAST

18:20.467 --> 18:22.400
IT DOESN'T LOOK HUMONGOUS
OR ANYTHING.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.767
-NO.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.133
BUT AT LEAST YOU FIT
INTO YOUR UNIFORM.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.900
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO
UNIFORM SHOPPING.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.767
YAY! IT'S STILL
VERY TIGHT, THOUGH.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.200
SINCE RETURNING FROM NEW YORK,

18:33.200 --> 18:35.700
I'M WORRIED THAT I'M GAINING
WEIGHT BECAUSE EACH DAY

18:35.700 --> 18:39.200
I GO TO SCHOOL, THE UNIFORM
JUST FITS TIGHTER AND TIGHTER.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.333
IT'S BECOMING A CHALLENGE
TO ZIP UP THESE SHORTS,

18:42.333 --> 18:44.400
AND IT JUST FEELS
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
HONESTLY, I WAS A LITTLE SCARED
OF PUTTING THESE PANTS ON

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
'CAUSE I WASN'T SURE IF
THEY WERE GONNA FIT OR NOT.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.467
LET'S DO LIKE
"THE BIGGEST LOSER"
AND HAVE A WEIGH-IN,

18:50.467 --> 18:51.767
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME WHAT YOU WEIGH.

18:51.767 --> 18:52.867
YOU WANT ME TO
WEIGH IN RIGHT NOW?

18:52.867 --> 18:54.400
I'M GONNA BRING THE SCALE.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.100
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW WE'RE
DOING BECAUSE WE WANT...

18:56.100 --> 18:57.967
-YOU CAN'T SEE THE NUMBER.
-I WON'T LOOK.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.200
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO SEE MY NUMBER.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.200
Jazz: AFTER I VISITED
DR. MARCI BOWERS,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.367
I FELT REALLY MOTIVATED
TO LOSE WEIGHT,

19:04.367 --> 19:06.633
AND I ENDED UP
LOSING SEVERAL POUNDS

19:06.633 --> 19:08.333
FROM THAT INITIAL WEIGH-IN,

19:08.333 --> 19:11.367
BUT I'M WORRIED THAT I MIGHT BE
HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.700
RIGHT HERE.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.933
ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT LOOKING.
I WILL CLOSE MY EYES.

19:16.933 --> 19:22.167
**

19:22.167 --> 19:24.367
THIS IS BAD.

19:24.367 --> 19:28.800
YEAH. YOU'RE WITNESSING
JAZZ'S PATH TO LESBIANITY.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.267
-HEY!
-HEY!

19:30.267 --> 19:33.833
SEEING VICTORIA KIND OF MAKES ME
FEEL A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATED.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.067
RIGHT HERE.

19:39.067 --> 19:42.133
ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT LOOKING.
I WILL CLOSE MY EYES.

19:42.133 --> 19:47.600
**

19:47.600 --> 19:48.800
I GAINED WEIGHT.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.700
I'M 5 POUNDS MORE.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.200
WHEN I SEE THE NUMBER
ON THE SCALE,

19:53.200 --> 19:54.967
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.100
I'M GAINING WEIGHT,
AND I CAN'T HELP IT,

19:57.100 --> 19:59.767
AND IT'S DEFINITELY HARD
TO PROCESS THIS SETBACK.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.267
DO YOU THINK I'M FAT?

20:01.267 --> 20:03.633
NO. I WOULDN'T
CALL YOU FAT.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.133
WHY DO YOU CALL ME
FAT SOMETIMES?

20:06.133 --> 20:07.733
WELL, I DO THAT
TO JUST GET YOU GOING.

20:07.733 --> 20:11.467
I GO, "YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
FAT," THAT KIND OF THING.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.667
-YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU SAY...
-I DON'T THINK YOU LOOK FAT.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.000
...LIKE, IF I SAW HOW I LOOKED,
THAT I WOULD BE MORE MOTIVATED.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.633
WELL, THAT'S WHEN YOU GO
TO McDONALD'S,

20:17.633 --> 20:19.200
AND YOU BROUGHT HOME
McDONALD'S, AND YOU'RE LIKE,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.300
"I DON'T CARE," AND I'M LIKE,
"JAZZ, LOOK AT YOURSELF.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.833
SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE,
AND THEN YOU WOULD CARE,"

20:22.833 --> 20:26.500
BECAUSE YOU'RE, LIKE, IN DENIAL,
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH," YOU KNOW?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.567
IF IT WASN'T THIS WHOLE SURGERY
THING, YOU KNOW, I'D BE LIKE,

20:28.567 --> 20:31.600
"ALL RIGHT. IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH
THE WAY YOU LOOK, THEN FINE,"

20:31.600 --> 20:35.600
BUT THIS IS FOR HEALTH REASONS
AND FOR SURGERY REASONS.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.233
THAT'S WHY I GET ANGRY WITH YOU
WHEN YOU CHEAT,

20:39.233 --> 20:41.233
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SABOTAGING YOURSELF.

20:41.233 --> 20:42.533
I KNOW.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.067
Jazz: IT'S KIND OF A FINE LINE
IN TERMS OF MY MOM

20:45.067 --> 20:48.000
HELPING OR HURTING ME
WITH THIS WEIGHT LOSS THING.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.033
ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM,
SHE REALLY IS THERE FOR ME,

20:51.033 --> 20:54.433
AND SHE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT
I LOSE WEIGHT AND BE HEALTHY

20:54.433 --> 20:55.967
AND DO WHAT I NEED TO DO.

20:55.967 --> 20:59.900
HOWEVER, SHE CAN BE VERY HARSH,
AND THAT KIND OF DISCOURAGES ME.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.333
I'M GOING TO JUST FOCUS
ON ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME,

21:02.333 --> 21:04.933
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST
GETTING THE THERAPY LETTERS.

21:04.933 --> 21:07.133
DR. MARILYN VOLKER,
SHE'S EASY.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.600
SHE'S OUR FIRST LETTER.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
CLEARLY, SHE'S BEEN WITH ME
SINCE I WAS 3 YEARS OLD.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.067
SO, I MEAN, LET'S JUST
GET IT DONE WITH, HONESTLY.

21:14.067 --> 21:16.567
YAY.

21:16.567 --> 21:17.900
APPLAUSE! JAZZ SAID
SHE'LL GO TO THERAPY,

21:17.900 --> 21:19.367
BUT JUST TO GET
THE LETTER.

21:19.367 --> 21:24.067
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIKE,
"SO HOW WAS YOUR PAST WEEK?"

21:24.067 --> 21:26.300
Jeanette: JAZZ THINKS
SHE'S GOT THIS COVERED.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.400
HOWEVER,
THERE'S THE EATING STUFF,

21:29.400 --> 21:33.267
AND I DON'T KNOW IF DR. VOLKER
WILL GIVE A THUMBS-UP

21:33.267 --> 21:36.533
BECAUSE WHAT'S BEHIND
THE EATING.

21:36.533 --> 21:43.100
**

21:43.100 --> 21:44.300
Griffen: PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY.
WE NEED TO PACK.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.100
-OH, MY GOD.
-Griffen: OH, MY GOD IS RIGHT.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.300
HEY, RAINBOW SHIRT.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.867
YOU GUYS ARE PACKING
EVERYTHING UP?

21:49.867 --> 21:51.200
TRYING TO.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.800
BEING HOME IS FUN, BUT, YEAH,
GOING BACK TO COLLEGE,

21:53.800 --> 21:55.133
I'M PRETTY EXCITED.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.100
I'M ABOUT TO GO ON
MY FIRST HANGOUT WITH A GIRL,

21:57.100 --> 21:59.733
AND I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO MY BROTHERS.

21:59.733 --> 22:02.267
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY
THE BEST PEOPLE TO TURN TO

22:02.267 --> 22:04.233
WHEN IT COMES TO ADVICE
AND DATING GIRLS

22:04.233 --> 22:05.967
BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY
DATE GIRLS.

22:05.967 --> 22:08.433
THEY HOOK UP WITH GIRLS.

22:08.433 --> 22:10.967
BUT THEY CAN GIVE ME
THAT INSIGHT,

22:10.967 --> 22:13.633
AND WHAT I DO WITH THAT PERSON
IS UP TO ME.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.933
LET'S SAY, HYPOTHETICALLY,

22:15.933 --> 22:18.700
I WAS INTERESTED IN A GIRL.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.067
HOW DO YOU GUYS
ATTRACT THE LADIES?

22:21.067 --> 22:22.767
HOW DO YOU ATTRACT
THE LADIES?

22:22.767 --> 22:24.067
IT'S INTERESTING
FOR MY LITTLE SISTER

22:24.067 --> 22:25.400
TO BE EVEN ASKING ME THAT.
-YEAH.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.167
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION
I'D EXPECT YOU TO ASK ME,

22:27.167 --> 22:28.733
BUT I SUPPORT
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

22:28.733 --> 22:30.067
IN DATING GIRLS,
FOR SURE.

22:30.067 --> 22:32.133
Sander: WE'VE NEVER TOLD JAZZ
HOW TO LIVE HER LIFE,

22:32.133 --> 22:33.833
SO NOW SHE SAYS
SHE'S PANSEXUAL.

22:33.833 --> 22:35.067
SHE'S PANSEXUAL.

22:35.067 --> 22:37.867
Woman: DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT "PANSEXUAL" IS?

22:37.867 --> 22:39.533
GOOD QUESTION.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.933
I-I THINK PANSEXUAL MEANS

22:41.933 --> 22:44.233
ONE DAY,
YOU LIKE THIS GENDER,

22:44.233 --> 22:46.300
AND THE NEXT DAY, YOU LIKE
THIS GENDER? NO, NOT QUITE.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.900
NO. YOU, LIKE,
PRETTY MUCH LIKE BOTH.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.067
YEAH. YOU LIKE BOTH.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.567
Woman: IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT ABOUT GENDER AT ALL.

22:50.567 --> 22:51.800
IT'S ABOUT, LIKE,
YOU'RE ATTRACTED

22:51.800 --> 22:52.900
TO A PERSON'S PERSONALITY,

22:52.900 --> 22:54.467
AND, LIKE, YOU DON'T EVEN
SEE GENDER.

22:54.467 --> 22:55.467
-Woman: YEAH.

22:55.467 --> 22:57.300
OH. SEE? YEAH.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.833
I MEAN, LIKE, I LEARN
NEW THINGS EVERY DAY.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.300
-UM, TO ATTRACT GIRLS...
-Griffen: HMM.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.167
WELL...

23:03.167 --> 23:05.833
GIRLS DON'T LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE THAT CLINGY,

23:05.833 --> 23:06.967
BUT THEY LIKE WHEN
YOU SHOW ATTENTION.

23:06.967 --> 23:08.333
NO, BUT SOME GIRLS DO.

23:08.333 --> 23:09.533
Griffen: YOU GOT TO BE, LIKE,
YOU GOT TO CALL THEM PRETTY.

23:09.533 --> 23:10.967
-CALL 'EM PRETTY.
-"PRETTY" IS A GOOD WORD.

23:10.967 --> 23:12.200
-"BEAUTIFUL..."
-"BEAUTIFUL."

23:12.200 --> 23:13.567
...THE KEY
TO A GIRL'S HEART.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.800
ONCE YOU TELL 'EM THEY'RE
BEAUTIFUL, AND THEY'RE LIKE,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.867
"OH, MY GOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH,"
YOU'D BE LIKE,

23:17.867 --> 23:21.067
"NO NEED TO THANK ME
FOR POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS."

23:21.067 --> 23:22.500
OH, MY GOD.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.633
WELL, MY BEST DATING ADVICE
TO YOU WOULD BE, BE YOURSELF.

23:25.633 --> 23:27.833
I FEEL LIKE, WITH YOU,
YOU NEED TO FIND A GIRL

23:27.833 --> 23:29.400
THAT YOU HAVE
A REAL CONNECTION WITH.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.733
AND YOU MIGHT JUST BE FRIENDS

23:30.733 --> 23:31.967
AND YOU MIGHT JUST NEVER GET OUT
OF THE FRIEND ZONE,

23:31.967 --> 23:34.300
BUT, LIKE, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN ONE DAY IT CLICKS,

23:34.300 --> 23:36.467
AND YOU BREAK THAT BARRIER.

23:36.467 --> 23:38.400
AND THOSE, I FEEL LIKE,
ARE THE BEST RELATIONSHIPS,

23:38.400 --> 23:42.100
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.833
Jazz: SOMETIMES MY BROTHERS
ARE A LITTLE GOOFY.

23:44.833 --> 23:47.900
HOWEVER, I DID LEARN SOME
LITTLE THINGS HERE AND THERE,

23:47.900 --> 23:50.667
BUT I DEFINITELY THINK
ME BEING TRANSGENDER

23:50.667 --> 23:55.333
CAUSES ME TO HAVE A HARDER TIME
FINDING A ROMANTIC PARTNER.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.233
THE ONLY THING YOU GUYS
CAN NOT DO IS,

23:58.233 --> 23:59.767
IF I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH A GIRL,

23:59.767 --> 24:01.233
YOU BETTER NOT TAKE MY GIRL.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.333
-I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.933
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION FOR ME,

24:04.933 --> 24:07.467
TO STEAL MY SISTER'S GIRL.

24:09.167 --> 24:15.500
**

24:15.500 --> 24:17.733
SO HOW YOU FEELING
ABOUT THIS?

24:17.733 --> 24:18.733
I JUST WANT TO GET IT DONE,

24:18.733 --> 24:20.333
LIKE, BADA-BOOM BADA-BING,
YOU KNOW?

24:20.333 --> 24:23.100
-HELLO.
-HI!

24:23.100 --> 24:26.267
I'M MEETING WITH DR. VOLKER
TO GET MY FIRST LETTER

24:26.267 --> 24:28.667
FOR THE GENDER CONFIRMATION
SURGERY.

24:28.667 --> 24:32.233
SO AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE
APPROACHING THE DATE OF SURGERY,

24:32.233 --> 24:35.467
AND WE'RE HERE BECAUSE SHE NEEDS
HER LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION.

24:35.467 --> 24:38.633
IT'S A LETTER TO AFFIRM THAT

24:38.633 --> 24:41.833
ALL OF THE STEPS
AND REQUIREMENTS

24:41.833 --> 24:44.067
HAVE BEEN ASSESSED
AND CHECKED OFF,

24:44.067 --> 24:47.733
AND MANY OF THEM,
OF COURSE, ARE ALREADY MET.

24:47.733 --> 24:50.633
DR. VOLKER HAS BEEN SEEING JAZZ
SINCE SHE WAS ITTY-BITTY,

24:50.633 --> 24:52.633
HAS BEEN WITH US
THE ENTIRE JOURNEY,

24:52.633 --> 24:54.433
AND SHE IS THE GO-TO
FOR THIS LETTER.

24:54.433 --> 24:56.200
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH JAZZ
BY HERSELF,

24:56.200 --> 24:57.767
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
-ABSOLUTELY.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.533
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
THAT DR. MARILYN VOLKER

24:59.533 --> 25:00.833
WILL WRITE ME THE LETTER.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.600
SHE KNOWS THAT I'M
OBVIOUSLY TRANSGENDER,

25:03.600 --> 25:06.333
AND I KNOW THAT SHE'S JUST GONNA
CHECK OFF ALL THE BOXES,

25:06.333 --> 25:09.567
SIGN ME OFF, AND THEN I CAN
MOVE ON WITH THIS PROCESS.

25:09.567 --> 25:11.800
MOST TEENAGERS
DON'T LIKE TO COME IN

25:11.800 --> 25:13.933
AND GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS
OF ASSESSING.

25:13.933 --> 25:15.767
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

25:15.767 --> 25:17.833
I MEAN, IT'S FINE TO ME.

25:17.833 --> 25:19.367
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
I NEED TO GET DONE.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.067
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

25:21.067 --> 25:25.233
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
YOUR BODY AT THIS POINT?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.833
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT.

25:27.833 --> 25:30.133
THERE IS DYSPHORIA,
WHICH IS CLEAR

25:30.133 --> 25:32.367
'CAUSE I HAVE
GENDER DYSPHORIA.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.733
IN YOUR MIND,

25:34.733 --> 25:36.533
WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT VAGINA MADE,

25:36.533 --> 25:40.600
THE VAGINOPLASTY, HOW IS IT
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.700
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE
HAPPIER WITH MY BODY.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.267
I MEAN, THERE IS STILL
THE WEIGHT PROBLEM,

25:44.267 --> 25:46.233
BUT THAT'S ALMOST
SEPARATE, YOU KNOW?

25:46.233 --> 25:47.633
OKAY.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.100
OH, YES, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO FACE THAT, ABSOLUTELY.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.733
THAT'S, UM, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE SAYING THAT

25:52.733 --> 25:55.333
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT
YOU TO THINK THAT,

25:55.333 --> 25:57.567
"JUST BECAUSE I GET
THIS VAGINA MADE

25:57.567 --> 26:00.667
I'M GONNA BE, LIKE,
ALL OF A SUDDEN THINNER."

26:00.667 --> 26:02.633
YEAH. NO, OBVIOUSLY NOT.

26:02.633 --> 26:06.467
Volker: RECENTLY JEANETTE SAID
THAT JAZZ HAS GAINED WEIGHT,

26:06.467 --> 26:09.533
AND IT'S BEEN MANY MONTHS
SINCE I HAVE SEEN JAZZ

26:09.533 --> 26:11.333
PHYSICALLY IN MY OFFICE,

26:11.333 --> 26:15.167
SO IT'S VERY CRITICAL TO TALK
ABOUT HER BINGE EATING.

26:15.167 --> 26:19.067
DID ANY OF THE DOCTORS
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WEIGHT

26:19.067 --> 26:22.633
IN RELATIONSHIP
TO THE SURGERY COMING UP?

26:22.633 --> 26:25.067
um, THEY SAID I NEED
TO LOSE 30 POUNDS

26:25.067 --> 26:26.733
BEFORE I COULD GET
THE SURGERY DONE.

26:26.733 --> 26:30.167
HOWEVER, IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE,
AND IT'S JUST...

26:30.167 --> 26:32.967
THE REASON WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT
IS 'CAUSE I'M A BINGE EATER,

26:32.967 --> 26:36.300
AND I TAKE A LOT OF COMFORT
IN FOOD.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.700
-I'M A STRESS EATER.
-MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.567
AND I ALMOST DON'T WANT
TO STOP MYSELF

26:40.567 --> 26:43.333
BECAUSE I LOVE FOOD SO MUCH.

26:43.333 --> 26:44.867
IT'S, LIKE, HARD TO LET GO.

26:44.867 --> 26:47.800
I DON'T CARE IF I DIE
A FEW YEARS EARLIER

26:47.800 --> 26:49.400
JUST BECAUSE OF FOOD.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.800
OH. OKAY.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.233
SO FOOD,
YOU FIND COMFORT IN.

26:54.233 --> 26:55.467
-MM-HMM.
-OKAY.

26:55.467 --> 26:57.833
WHEN DO YOU NEED COMFORT?

26:57.833 --> 27:00.733
I'M JUST VERY STRESSED,

27:00.733 --> 27:04.400
AND I'M NOT ALWAYS
VERY HAPPY, SO...

27:04.400 --> 27:08.500
DO YOU WAKE UP AND...
"I'M STRESSED"?

27:08.500 --> 27:12.167
I MEAN, IF I HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL, YEAH.

27:12.167 --> 27:14.367
WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE
ABOUT SCHOOL?

27:14.367 --> 27:15.533
OR WHAT'S STRESSFUL
ABOUT SCHOOL?

27:15.533 --> 27:17.633
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING
ABOUT SCHOOL.

27:17.633 --> 27:19.233
Jazz: I APPRECIATE EDUCATION,

27:19.233 --> 27:22.633
BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF FRIENDS AT MY SCHOOL,

27:22.633 --> 27:24.900
AND THERE'S NO ONE
WHO I CAN REALLY TALK TO.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.600
I FEEL LONELY SOMETIMES.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.500
IT'S HARD 'CAUSE I'M
SUCH A PERFECTIONIST,

27:30.500 --> 27:35.867
SO IT'S EITHER I TRY MY HARDEST
AND BE VALEDICTORIAN,

27:35.867 --> 27:38.100
OR I DROP OUT OF
HIGH SCHOOL.

27:38.100 --> 27:41.567
THOSE ARE THE ENDS
OF THE SPECTRUM.

27:41.567 --> 27:45.300
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU EXPECT
TOO MUCH OF YOU?

27:45.300 --> 27:47.200
YEAH. I MEAN, LIKE,

27:47.200 --> 27:49.067
THERE'S DEFINITELY
A LOT OF THINGS

27:49.067 --> 27:51.467
THAT I HAVE TO DO AND THINGS
WHERE I HAVE TO BE SERIOUS,

27:51.467 --> 27:53.067
WHERE I HAVE TO BE
AN ADULT.

27:53.067 --> 27:56.067
I'VE HAD TO FACE A LOT
OF BIG DECISIONS IN MY LIFE,

27:56.067 --> 27:57.967
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS SURGERY,

27:57.967 --> 28:00.800
AND...IT'S DIFFICULT.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.267
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
THAT GOES WRONG WITH ME,

28:04.267 --> 28:09.400
ESPECIALLY WITH ME TRYING
THIS EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.700
IT'S ONLY BEEN DONE
ABOUT 15 TIMES.

28:11.700 --> 28:14.300
THERE ARE PROBLEMS
THAT CAN OCCUR,

28:14.300 --> 28:17.833
AND PROBLEMS ALWAYS SEEM
TO HIT ME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.900
-OH.
-YEAH.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.433
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE
IS TESTING ME.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.067
OKAY, OKAY.

28:25.067 --> 28:28.067
AND I FEEL LIKE MOST PEOPLE
WOULD BE ABLE TO JUGGLE IT

28:28.067 --> 28:31.100
AND GET THROUGH IT,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.467
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT GETTING THROUGH IT.

28:33.467 --> 28:35.867
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I GO IN
MY ROOM AND SHELTER MYSELF

28:35.867 --> 28:37.733
AND...ALL THAT.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.833
OH.
IS THAT HOW YOU COPE?

28:39.833 --> 28:41.833
WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S
THE ONLY THING

28:41.833 --> 28:43.733
I LIKE TO DO
IN LIFE RIGHT NOW,

28:43.733 --> 28:47.100
IS JUST LAY DOWN, WATCH TV
ON MY COMPUTER WHILE EATING.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.400
EVERY ONE OF US HAS TO
REALLY LOOK AT THIS.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.600
NOW THE ONLY THING IS,

28:52.600 --> 28:55.200
SEE, THERE'S POSITIVE COPING
AND NEGATIVE COPING.

28:55.200 --> 29:00.067
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH
STRESS AND ANXIETY

29:00.067 --> 29:02.933
WILL COPE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

29:02.933 --> 29:04.900
SHE CHOSE FOOD.

29:04.900 --> 29:08.900
RIGHT NOW THERE MUST BE,
THEN, COMFORT IN EATING.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.767
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
VERY PRODUCTIVE, IS IT?

29:11.767 --> 29:13.967
WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE
TO ASSESS THAT.

29:13.967 --> 29:16.633
YOU'RE MOVING ON SOMETHING
CALLED HARM REDUCTION.

29:16.633 --> 29:19.767
SO WHAT KINDS OF OTHER
ACTIVITIES WOULD YOU DO

29:19.767 --> 29:21.467
TO PROVIDE COMFORT?

29:21.467 --> 29:24.433
THAT WOULD BE
THE WHOLE IDEA.

29:24.433 --> 29:25.767
I DON'T KNOW.

29:25.767 --> 29:28.700
YOU TAKE
ONE COPING BEHAVIOR AWAY,

29:28.700 --> 29:30.833
YOU HAVE TO PUT
SOMETHING ELSE IN ITS PLACE.

29:30.833 --> 29:34.133
THAT IS THE PROCESS
OF THIS HARM REDUCTION,

29:34.133 --> 29:37.800
BUT UNDERNEATH THIS ARE STILL
A NUMBER

29:37.800 --> 29:42.100
OF VERY STRESSFUL
AND INSECURITIES

29:42.100 --> 29:45.067
THAT NEED TO BE
ADDRESSED ALONG THE WAY.

29:45.067 --> 29:48.567
YOU HAVE
A TARGET DATE SET

29:48.567 --> 29:52.633
FOR "WHEN I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE THIS SURGERY"?

29:52.633 --> 29:54.633
PROBABLY THE BEGINNING
OF SUMMER.

29:54.633 --> 29:55.933
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

29:55.933 --> 29:58.333
SO IT GIVES US
ENOUGH TIME HERE

29:58.333 --> 30:00.533
TO REALLY WORK ON
SOME OF THOSE GOALS.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.133
-MM-HMM.
-GREAT.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.300
UH, LET'S BRING MOM IN.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.633
Jazz: I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS

30:05.633 --> 30:07.567
ABOUT TODAY'S SESSION
WITH DR. VOLKER

30:07.567 --> 30:10.667
BECAUSE SHE SEEMS
VERY DISTRAUGHT

30:10.667 --> 30:12.767
ABOUT THIS WEIGHT LOSS THING.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.733
I'M SURE YOU HAD
A WONDERFUL SESSION.

30:14.733 --> 30:17.533
WE DID. I'VE BEEN ASKING
YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS

30:17.533 --> 30:20.833
TO GO THROUGH SOME THINGS,
MOSTLY ABOUT THIS LETTER.

30:20.833 --> 30:23.767
I JUST NEED TO KNOW, LIKE, WHAT
THE NEXT STEP IS WITH THE LETTER

30:23.767 --> 30:25.233
AND MAKE SURE SHE'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

30:25.233 --> 30:26.733
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO SAY,
"ARE WE GETTING THE LETTER?"

30:26.733 --> 30:30.633
**

30:30.633 --> 30:32.833
HOW MANY RELATIONSHIPS
HAVE YOU BEEN IN, VICTORIA?

30:32.833 --> 30:36.167
I'M COUNTING RIGHT NOW.
LIKE, FI--

30:36.167 --> 30:39.133
SIX...OR SEVEN?

30:43.500 --> 30:47.600
I JUST WANT TO CLEARLY MAKE SURE
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO

30:47.600 --> 30:49.433
TO HAVE THE LETTER
AND EVERYTHING IN PLACE,

30:49.433 --> 30:50.900
THAT WE MAKE SURE
SHE'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.000
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO SAY,
"ARE WE GETTING THE LETTER?"

30:52.000 --> 30:55.067
IN THE LETTER,
I'M GOING TO BE SAYING

30:55.067 --> 31:00.233
THAT JAZZ HAS BEEN VERY
CLEARLY AWARE OF HEALTHINESS

31:00.233 --> 31:02.133
IN FACING A SURGERY.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.767
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WEIGHT.

31:03.767 --> 31:08.600
IT'S ABOUT BEHIND IT, THAT
KIND OF ANXIETY AND COMFORT.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
WORKING ON HARM REDUCTION.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.767
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU COME
BACK TO GO THROUGH SOME THINGS,

31:14.767 --> 31:17.633
MOSTLY ABOUT THE WEIGHT.

31:17.633 --> 31:21.567
I REALLY STILL DON'T WANT YOU
TO JUST LIVE IN ANXIOUSNESS.

31:21.567 --> 31:25.600
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT,
"WHAT COULD I DO TO FIND COMFORT

31:25.600 --> 31:29.333
WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT MAY NOT BE AS MUCH FOOD?"

31:29.333 --> 31:32.800
AND I OBVIOUSLY DON'T
WANT YOU TO STOP EATING.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.533
THEN I'M WILLING
TO WRITE THE LETTER.

31:35.533 --> 31:38.800
Jeanette: THIS WHOLE WEIGHT
THING, IT'S BECOME AN ALBATROSS.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.900
WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE
ON IT RIGHT NOW

31:40.900 --> 31:43.900
BECAUSE I'M REALLY WORRIED
IF SHE IS MENTALLY

31:43.900 --> 31:46.067
AND PHYSICALLY SOUND
TO HAVE THIS SURGERY.

31:46.067 --> 31:49.133
MARILYN IS ONE OF THE TOPS
IN THE FIELD, IF NOT THE TOP,

31:49.133 --> 31:51.600
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TRUST
THE DOCTOR.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.233
Jazz: IT'S PRETTY DISAPPOINTING,
REALLY,

31:53.233 --> 31:56.067
THAT DR. MARILYN VOLKER
DIDN'T SIGN THIS LETTER.

31:56.067 --> 31:59.167
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW THAT
I'M READY FOR THIS OPERATION.

31:59.167 --> 32:03.067
I'VE WANTED IT MY ENTIRE LIFE,
AND I FEEL LIKE ITS VERY OBVIOUS

32:03.067 --> 32:05.400
THAT GETTING MY LETTERS
FOR THIS SURGERY

32:05.400 --> 32:08.233
WILL BE HARDER THAN
I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

32:09.700 --> 32:18.700
**

32:18.700 --> 32:20.867
Jazz: YOU KNOW I DON'T
PLAY BASKETBALL, RIGHT?

32:20.867 --> 32:22.333
Greg: THAT'S OKAY.
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.600
I DON'T
PLAY BASKETBALL EITHER.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.667
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO, THOUGH.

32:24.667 --> 32:25.967
YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE
AROUND A LITTLE,

32:25.967 --> 32:27.433
BUT WE'RE GOING TO
ACTUALLY PLAY, SO DRIBBLE.

32:27.433 --> 32:29.433
-I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIBBLE.
-YEAH. JUST DRIBBLE LIKE THIS.

32:29.433 --> 32:30.567
YOU COULD EVEN PICK IT UP
IF YOU WANT.

32:30.567 --> 32:32.433
OKAY, BUT I CAN'T, LIKE,
DO ANYTHING.

32:32.433 --> 32:34.567
HERE. DEFEND ME.
GET BETWEEN ME AND THE BASKET.

32:34.567 --> 32:35.867
DO I LOOK LIKE I KNOW
HOW TO DEFEND YOU?

32:35.867 --> 32:37.133
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET...

32:37.133 --> 32:39.167
I'M GOING FOR THE BASKET.

32:39.167 --> 32:42.200
Greg:
JAZZ DOES NOT HAVE A PARTICULAR
AFFINITY TOWARDS BASKETBALL,

32:42.200 --> 32:43.500
AND NEITHER DO I.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.700
I THINK OF BASKETBALL AS A WAY
FOR JUST ME AND JAZZ

32:45.700 --> 32:47.067
TO DO SOMETHING ACTIVE TOGETHER,

32:47.067 --> 32:50.600
AND IT GIVES US A LITTLE
DADDY/DAUGHTER TIME.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.400
SO TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR MEETING WITH MARILYN.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.067
-IT DIDN'T GO THAT GREAT.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:58.300 --> 33:00.367
SO, I MEAN, WE TALKED ABOUT
A LOT OF STUFF,

33:00.367 --> 33:01.567
SO DON'T GET ME WRONG.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.600
BUT, LIKE, THE MAIN
NEGATIVE TAKEAWAY

33:03.600 --> 33:06.133
WAS THAT SHE SAID SHE'S NOT
GONNA SIGN A LETTER

33:06.133 --> 33:08.600
UNLESS I LOSE WEIGHT.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.867
WELL, WHY IS THAT?

33:09.867 --> 33:12.333
I MEAN, HOW DID SHE GET
TO THAT CONCLUSION?

33:12.333 --> 33:15.067
BECAUSE SHE THINKS THAT
I COMFORT EAT

33:15.067 --> 33:16.500
AND EAT OUT OF STRESS,
AND THAT'S,

33:16.500 --> 33:19.067
LIKE, PSYCHOLOGICALLY NEGATIVE.
-YEAH, BUT...

33:19.067 --> 33:23.067
SHE WANTS ME TO REDUCE THE HARM
TO MYSELF, HARM REDUCTION.

33:23.067 --> 33:26.233
NO PARENT WANTS TO HEAR
THE TERM "HARM REDUCTION"

33:26.233 --> 33:27.400
USED IN A SENTENCE

33:27.400 --> 33:29.967
TO DESCRIBE WHAT
THEIR CHILD IS GOING THROUGH.

33:29.967 --> 33:31.900
DID SHE SAY THE FOOD
IS CAUSING HARM?

33:31.900 --> 33:33.233
I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT
SHE'S SAYING?

33:33.233 --> 33:36.100
IT'S HARM, YEAH.
IT IS PHYSICAL HARM TO MY BODY.

33:36.100 --> 33:39.667
Greg: THE QUESTION IS, IS SHE
GONNA WORK ON HER WEIGHT NOW,

33:39.667 --> 33:43.167
OR DOES SHE FEEL LIKE
SHE COULD DELAY

33:43.167 --> 33:45.333
SOME OF THIS HARM REDUCTION?

33:45.333 --> 33:46.900
HOW ARE WE GOING TO
FIX THIS ISSUE?

33:46.900 --> 33:48.500
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
ON A CONSISTENT BASIS?

33:48.500 --> 33:50.667
YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS
THE FATTEST PERSON IN THE WORLD,

33:50.667 --> 33:52.667
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "HOW ARE
WE GOING TO FIX THIS ISSUE?"

33:52.667 --> 33:56.067
JAZZ, YOU'RE NOT EVEN FAT.
AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE TERM.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.500
-THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON.
-I'M CHUBBY.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.333
YOU JUST -- YOU'RE NOT
THE HEALTHIEST YOU COULD BE.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.700
I KNOW.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.300
Jazz: I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING

34:04.300 --> 34:05.733
MY DAD COULD DO
TO BE MORE SUPPORTIVE

34:05.733 --> 34:08.700
BECAUSE HE'S NOT SUPER
JUDGMENTAL ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.

34:08.700 --> 34:11.533
AND IN THAT REGARD,
I LIKE TALKING TO HIM

34:11.533 --> 34:14.400
BECAUSE HE HAS AN OPEN EAR.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.667
HE'S WILLING TO LISTEN
AND PROVIDE INSIGHT

34:16.667 --> 34:19.833
WITHOUT CRITICIZING ME
OR WHAT I'M DOING.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.167
SO WHAT OTHER THINGS DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING

34:21.167 --> 34:22.800
TO DO TO, UH, GET IN SHAPE?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.067
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
BASKETBALL, BUT I'M HERE.

34:25.067 --> 34:26.633
AS LONG AS I'M MOVING AROUND,

34:26.633 --> 34:29.067
THAT'S GONNA HELP ME
LOSE THOSE 30 POUNDS.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.400
I'M ON TEAM JAZZ.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.267
I WANNA HELP JAZZ GET OUT THERE
AND GET THE BALL ROLLING

34:33.267 --> 34:36.633
AND HELP HER
GET HER B.M.I. DOWN.

34:36.633 --> 34:40.067
I'M PART OF THE EQUATION
FOR HARM REDUCTION.

34:40.067 --> 34:43.867
I WILL BE A HARM REDUCER
TO THE EXTENT I CAN BE.

34:43.867 --> 34:45.300
HOLD ON.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.667
I JUST CAME UP WITH AN AMAZING
ANALOGY FOR THE BASKETBALL HOOP.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.067
IF YOU MISS IT...

34:50.067 --> 34:51.933
YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP TRYING
TILL YOU MAKE IT.

34:54.400 --> 34:59.700
**

34:59.700 --> 35:01.100
Jazz: SKEE-BALL. DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY SKEE

35:01.100 --> 35:02.600
Jayleen:
YEAH. LET'S GO.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.500
I LIKE SKEE-BALL, ALTHOUGH
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOOD AT IT.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.200
TODAY, MICHAELA
AND HER FRIEND VICTORIA

35:08.200 --> 35:10.467
ARE MEETING UP
WITH JAY AND I TO HANG OUT.

35:10.467 --> 35:13.900
NO DOUBLE DATING. IT'S JUST US
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

35:15.267 --> 35:18.067
53! TIE!

35:18.067 --> 35:21.233
JAY UNDERSTANDS ME
AND MY PAST DATING LIFE,

35:21.233 --> 35:23.967
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY
UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR ME,

35:23.967 --> 35:26.333
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT ANXIOUS.

35:26.333 --> 35:30.100
YEAH. YOU'RE WITNESSING
JAZZ'S PATH TO LESBIANITY.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.433
LES--

35:32.433 --> 35:34.067
THAT'S NOT EVEN A THING.

35:34.067 --> 35:36.767
Jayleen: I'M PROUD OF JAZZ
BECAUSE DATING AS A TEENAGER

35:36.767 --> 35:38.600
IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH
FOR ANYBODY.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.167
I DON'T MIND IF JAZZ DATES
A BOY OR A GIRL,

35:41.167 --> 35:43.400
BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE KIND
AND ACCEPT HER

35:43.400 --> 35:46.067
AND DON'T HURT HER,
THEN I'M GOOD WITH IT.

35:46.067 --> 35:49.567
Jayleen: I GOT 50!

35:49.567 --> 35:51.700
OH! I GOT 50!
-Jazz: OHH!

35:51.700 --> 35:54.433
I THOUGHT
I WAS DOING GOOD.

35:54.433 --> 35:55.967
-OH, MAN.
-HEY!

35:55.967 --> 35:57.867
HI! HOW ARE YOU?

35:57.867 --> 35:59.200
-HI.
-YOU'RE SO CUTE.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.267
-THANK YOU.

36:01.267 --> 36:03.333
I WASN'T NECESSARILY
EXPECTING ANYTHING

36:03.333 --> 36:05.433
WHEN IT CAME
TO MEETING VICTORIA.

36:05.433 --> 36:07.067
I JUST WENT INTO IT BLINDLY.

36:07.067 --> 36:09.800
AND SEEING HER,
I DEFINITELY THINK SHE'S CUTE.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.300
IT KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL
A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATED.

36:17.733 --> 36:19.533
YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY
THIS AIR HOCKEY THING?

36:19.533 --> 36:20.967
'CAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY INTENSE.

36:20.967 --> 36:23.667
THERE'S, LIKE,...
I THINK YOU PLAY ON TEAMS.

36:23.667 --> 36:24.833
-YEAH.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.833
Jazz: I JUST MET VICTORIA
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

36:26.833 --> 36:29.833
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT SHE IS
VERY, VERY PRETTY.

36:29.833 --> 36:31.967
-HERE. COME WITH ME.

36:31.967 --> 36:33.467
-YOU'LL BE ON MY TEAM.
-ALL RIGHT.

36:33.467 --> 36:36.067
Jazz: IT'S VERY INTIMIDATING AND
PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME,

36:36.067 --> 36:39.067
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO BE MYSELF
AND HOPEFULLY HAVE A GREAT TIME.

36:39.067 --> 36:40.600
LET'S PLAY WITH TWO.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.967
-OKAY, ONE...
-AAH!

36:41.967 --> 36:43.600
I'M VICTORIA.
I'M 17 YEARS OLD.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.800
I'M IN 12th GRADE,
AND I'VE AGREED TO MEET JAZZ

36:45.800 --> 36:47.233
BECAUSE I'M OPEN-MINDED

36:47.233 --> 36:50.333
AND I BASICALLY WILL
BE ATTRACTED TO ANYONE

36:50.333 --> 36:52.333
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
THEY IDENTIFY AS.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.933
TRANSGENDER IS INCLUDED IN THAT.

36:54.933 --> 36:57.567
OH!

36:57.567 --> 36:59.633
Victoria: I BASICALLY,
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,

36:59.633 --> 37:01.867
DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT DESCRIPTION I FIT,

37:01.867 --> 37:03.900
BUT THEN I STUMBLED UPON
PANSEXUAL,

37:03.900 --> 37:05.300
AND I REALIZED THAT,
THAT DEFINITION

37:05.300 --> 37:07.800
PERFECTLY FIT WHAT I FEEL.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.367
-AAH!
-OH!

37:11.367 --> 37:12.867
-YES!
-JAZZ WON.

37:12.867 --> 37:14.067
DOWN.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.600
UM, DO YOU GUYS WANNA GO
GO

37:17.600 --> 37:18.967
YES. LET'S DO IT.

37:18.967 --> 37:22.900
IN THE PAST, I'VE HAD BAD
DATING EXPERIENCES.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.567
I GET A LOT OF ANXIETY
WORRYING ABOUT

37:25.567 --> 37:27.600
WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAY
OR WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.833
SO I WANT TO APPROACH THIS
NEW SITUATION WITH VICTORIA

37:30.833 --> 37:33.733
DIFFERENTLY AND WITH
AN OPEN MIND.

37:33.733 --> 37:35.900
-ALL RIGHT.
-OH! AH!

37:35.900 --> 37:40.100
**

37:40.100 --> 37:41.433
Jayleen: AAH!

37:43.400 --> 37:46.367
OH, NO. OH, NO!
CAN'T GET OUT!

37:52.400 --> 37:54.767
**

37:54.767 --> 37:56.800
-AH!
-AAH!

37:56.800 --> 37:58.367
SHE CUT ME OFF!

37:58.367 --> 38:00.233
Jazz: I'M DEFINITELY ENJOYING
GO-KARTING.

38:00.233 --> 38:03.067
IT MAKES THE SITUATION
LIGHTHEARTED.

38:03.067 --> 38:04.700
Jazz: I'M BEATING YOU ALL!

38:04.700 --> 38:07.533
Michaela: OH, MY GOSH.
SHE'S GOING SO FAST.

38:07.533 --> 38:08.833
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED

38:08.833 --> 38:11.533
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
THAT PRESSURE OF MAKING IT

38:11.533 --> 38:14.567
A DATING EXPERIENCE.

38:14.567 --> 38:16.833
DEFINITELY NEED TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT ON.

38:16.833 --> 38:18.867
MY WRISTS ARE, LIKE,
IN SO MUCH PAIN.

38:18.867 --> 38:21.567
THAT WAS INTENSE,
THE GO-KARTING.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.100
I'M SO HUNGRY AFTER THAT.
IT WAS LIKE A WORKOUT.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.067
THOSE CAPS WE HAD TO WEAR
UNDER THE HELMETS,

38:26.067 --> 38:28.967
THEY REMINDED ME OF, LIKE,
WHAT THE SWIMMERS WEAR.

38:28.967 --> 38:30.400
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, SWIMMERS WEAR?

38:30.400 --> 38:31.667
YEAH, BECAUSE I WEAR THEM
FOR WATER POLO.

38:31.667 --> 38:32.967
OH. MICHAELA WAS
TELLING ME THAT.

38:32.967 --> 38:34.200
YEAH. I PLAY WATER POLO.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.600
SO WHAT POSITION DO YOU PLAY?

38:35.600 --> 38:38.567
I WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THE SET UP,

38:38.567 --> 38:40.367
'CAUSE DO YOU KNOW
WATER POLO RULES?

38:40.367 --> 38:41.967
-KIND OF.

38:41.967 --> 38:43.933
-IT'S KIND OF LIKE

38:43.933 --> 38:46.067
IF SOCCER AND BASKETBALL HAD
A BABY IN THE WATER.

38:46.067 --> 38:48.933
OH. OKAY.

38:48.933 --> 38:51.967
Michaela: I'M SEEING A LOT MORE
OF JAZZ' PERSONALITY BLOSSOM

38:51.967 --> 38:53.500
WITH VICTORIA.

38:53.500 --> 38:57.267
I'M SEEING JAZZ OPEN UP, AND SHE
DOESN'T HAVE THOSE WALLS UP

38:57.267 --> 38:59.733
THAT I SEE SHE HAS
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE,

38:59.733 --> 39:03.633
AND I THINK THAT VICTORIA
FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH JAZZ.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.867
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

39:05.867 --> 39:08.267
SO, LIKE, THERE'S JUST SO MANY,
LIKE, SMART PEOPLE

39:08.267 --> 39:09.667
ON THE TEAM
THAT I FEEL PRESSURED.

39:09.667 --> 39:13.067
MY WATER POLO TEAM,
WE'RE NOTORIOUS FOR BEING SMART.

39:13.067 --> 39:14.367
WELL, IF YOU'RE ON THE TEAM,

39:14.367 --> 39:16.067
THEN DOESN'T THAT MEAN
YOU'RE SMART, TOO?

39:16.067 --> 39:17.700
I MEAN, IT SHOULD MEAN
I'M SMART,

39:17.700 --> 39:21.067
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT COLLEGE
I GET INTO.

39:21.067 --> 39:25.400
WELL, DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, A HIGH
G.P.A. AND ALL THAT STUFF?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.067
YEAH.

39:27.067 --> 39:30.533
Jazz: VICTORIA SEEMS TO BE
ATHLETIC AND SMART,

39:30.533 --> 39:32.500
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
REALLY EXCITING

39:32.500 --> 39:34.133
BECAUSE I LOOK FOR SOMEONE

39:34.133 --> 39:35.633
WHO, YOU KNOW,

39:35.633 --> 39:38.600
CAN HAVE THOSE DEEP INTELLECTUAL
CONVERSATIONS WITH ME

39:38.600 --> 39:40.867
AND IS ABLE TO
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

39:40.867 --> 39:42.500
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.967
SHE'S BEEN IN
THREE RELATIONSHIPS.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.167
HOW MANY HAVE YOU BEEN IN?

39:46.167 --> 39:48.333
MORE THAN 10, LESS THAN 20.

39:48.333 --> 39:51.733
HOW DO YOU GUYS FIND PEOPLE?
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

39:51.733 --> 39:54.233
LIKE, HOW MANY RELATIONSHIPS
HAVE YOU BEEN IN, VICTORIA?

39:54.233 --> 39:57.867
I'M COUNTING RIGHT NOW.
LIKE, FI--

39:57.867 --> 39:59.800
SIX...OR SEVEN?

39:59.800 --> 40:01.300
I AM NOT THAT BAD.
-MAYBE EIGHT.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.167
ALL THESE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN
LIKE, "JAY, DOO, DOO, DOO."

40:03.167 --> 40:05.533
BUT NO, NOT THAT BAD.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.233
A LITTLE TENSE THERE. UM...

40:08.233 --> 40:10.200
Jazz: VICTORIA HAS A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE,

40:10.200 --> 40:11.633
AND, WITH DATING, I'M WORRIED

40:11.633 --> 40:14.067
IF SHE'S GOING TO BE
ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE LIKE ME

40:14.067 --> 40:16.167
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

40:16.167 --> 40:18.933
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO EXPERIENCE, LIKE,

40:18.933 --> 40:22.133
JUST 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE
SHOULD BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

40:22.133 --> 40:24.067
WHEN THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL,
JUST TO LEARN.

40:24.067 --> 40:25.633
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO, OBVIOUSLY,

40:25.633 --> 40:28.433
BUT I KNOW, LIKE, PEOPLE SAY
ITS OVERRATED, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

40:28.433 --> 40:29.667
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT OVERRATED.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.067
-IT'S NOT. YOU LEARN.
-IT'S NOT.

40:31.067 --> 40:33.400
-YOU DO LEARN A LOT.
-YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.200
OKAY, AND I JUST HAVEN'T HAD
THAT OPPORTUNITY AT ALL, SO...

40:36.200 --> 40:37.367
YOU LEARN TO BE
AT EASE.

40:37.367 --> 40:38.800
I MEAN, I JUST FEEL LIKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE --

40:38.800 --> 40:40.700
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
ARE INTIMIDATED BY ME,

40:40.700 --> 40:42.767
OR OTHER TIMES, LIKE,
THEY JUST CAN'T HANDLE ME

40:42.767 --> 40:44.667
'CAUSE I'M TOO MUCH.

40:44.667 --> 40:47.700
I'M TOO MUCH.
YOU KNOW I AM TOO MUCH.

40:47.700 --> 40:50.300
JAZZ SEEMS
REALLY OUTGOING AND FUN,

40:50.300 --> 40:51.967
AND, LIKE, I FEEL
A GOOD ENERGY FROM HER.

40:51.967 --> 40:54.167
LIKE, THERE'S NO NEGATIVE
VIBES ANYWHERE THERE.

40:54.167 --> 40:56.633
SO MANY PEOPLE TAKE IT SO HARD
WHEN I'M HONEST TO THEM,

40:56.633 --> 40:58.467
BUT LIKE...
-IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DEEP.

40:58.467 --> 40:59.600
Jazz: I WANT THEM TO BE
HONEST WITH ME.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.067
I WANT YOU TO
DISH IT OUT WITH ME,

41:01.067 --> 41:02.400
AND, LIKE, I DON'T WANT
TO BE RUDE, BUT I AM RUDE...

41:02.400 --> 41:04.200
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING RUDE AND HONEST.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.433
SOMETIMES I AM RUDE, THOUGH,
AND I TRY NOT TO BE, BUT...

41:06.433 --> 41:07.633
Jayleen: SHE DOESN'T
MEAN IT, THOUGH,

41:07.633 --> 41:08.967
AND YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE DOESN'T MEAN IT.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.267
YEAH, I KNOW,
BECAUSE I'M THE SAME WAY.

41:11.267 --> 41:14.067
Jazz: I AM DEFINITELY ATTRACTED
TO VICTORIA,

41:14.067 --> 41:17.067
BOTH PHYSICALLY AND DEFINITELY
PERSONALITY-WISE,

41:17.067 --> 41:19.133
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET
TO KNOW HER BETTER.

41:19.133 --> 41:22.233
I REALLY HOPE THAT VICTORIA
WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN AS WELL

41:22.233 --> 41:25.467
BECAUSE I JUST REALLY THINK
SHE'S A COOL PERSON,

41:25.467 --> 41:27.700
AND I HOPE SHE THINKS
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.667
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE ME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE ME.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.867
-IT'S -- WHEN SOMEBODY CARES...
-WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE.

41:31.867 --> 41:33.933
WE'LL SEE. IT'S FINE.

41:33.933 --> 41:39.733
**

41:39.733 --> 41:41.200
WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT VICTORIA?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.500
I REALLY THINK SHE DUG YOU.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.233
LIKE, I REALLY DID THINK
SHE WAS AWESOME,

41:45.233 --> 41:47.700
AND I WOULD HANG OUT WITH HER
AGAIN IF SHE'D BE WILLING TO.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.600
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.700
CHOCOLATE.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.367
WELL, IT'S THIN.
IT MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH.

41:52.367 --> 41:56.433
Jeanette: RIGHT NOW, IN JAZZ'S
LIFE, WILLPOWER IS NONEXISTENT.

41:56.433 --> 41:58.600
-ONE PER PERSON.
-THAT'S MY TREAT.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.967
EVERY DAY THAT I GO TO SCHOOL,
IT JUST IS SUCH A DREAD.

42:00.967 --> 42:03.200
-VIRTUAL SCHOOL.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.600
MY FEAR IS SHE COULD FALL PREY
TO JUST HANGING OUT IN HER ROOM,

42:06.600 --> 42:08.067
BINGE WATCHING, EATING,

42:08.067 --> 42:09.600
AND BECOMING MORE
AND MORE UNHEALTHY.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.467
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

42:11.467 --> 42:12.967
I'M THINKING OF SAYING

42:12.967 --> 42:15.733
"CAR WASH, DONATIONS FOR
TRANSFORMATIONS."

42:15.733 --> 42:16.900
Man: WHAT ARE
THE DONATIONS FOR?

42:16.900 --> 42:18.733
MY FRIEND LIN, HERE,
SHE'S TRANSGENDER,

42:18.733 --> 42:21.067
AND WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY
FOR HER HORMONES,

42:21.067 --> 42:23.900
SO IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
-YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.900
WE ARE JUST LIVING OUR LIVES
AS WHO WE ARE.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.267
-WE LOVE OURSELVES, AND WE...
-YOU DON'T LOVE WHO YOU ARE.

42:27.267 --> 42:28.667
...WISH THAT YOU COULD
EMBRACE US, TOO.

42:28.667 --> 42:29.900
YOU WERE BORN A CERTAIN WAY.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.167
YOU DON'T LOVE HOW
YOU WERE BORN.

42:31.167 --> 42:31.833
**
