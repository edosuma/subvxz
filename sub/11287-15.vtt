WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:02.987
Gosh, Russell,
I gotta give it to you

00:03.053 --> 00:04.086
this piece you put together

00:04.153 --> 00:06.120
for the music issue
is really nice.

00:06.187 --> 00:08.320
"Nice?"

00:08.387 --> 00:10.787
You told me
last week's review was nice.

00:10.853 --> 00:12.887
Is that your catchphrase
for everything?

00:14.220 --> 00:15.787
[scoffs]
Not at all.

00:15.853 --> 00:17.887
This piece you did
on New York nightlife

00:17.953 --> 00:20.520
was weak, uninspired

00:20.587 --> 00:23.320
and obviously written
after a drunken night

00:23.387 --> 00:25.420
of club‐hoppin'.

00:30.320 --> 00:33.020
Ivan, I just called
for a message thirty seconds ago

00:33.087 --> 00:35.053
how did you get here so fast?

00:35.120 --> 00:37.953
Well, to quote a modern poet,
Jeffery Osborne..

00:38.020 --> 00:39.620
"On The Wings Of Love."

00:40.753 --> 00:41.887
That's sweet.

00:41.953 --> 00:43.620
Now, fly your ass
over to the typesetters

00:43.687 --> 00:47.220
because if that's not there
in 15 minutes, I'm dead.

00:47.287 --> 00:49.020
Wait, you're talking about
all the way in midtown?

00:49.087 --> 00:50.820
Well, that's impossible,
unless I latch myself

00:50.887 --> 00:52.420
onto the back of a subway train

00:52.487 --> 00:54.420
keep my bike off the third rail.

00:55.387 --> 00:57.520
Khadijah, I can do this.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.927
Ivan, you're a prince.

01:03.027 --> 01:05.327
To quote the immortal
Donna Summer

01:05.393 --> 01:07.193
"I Feel Love."

01:08.226 --> 01:11.593
"I Feel Love." "I‐I Feel Love!"

What happened to you?

01:52.527 --> 01:54.927
I was takin' a shortcut
across Rockefeller Center

01:54.993 --> 01:56.127
on the ice.

01:56.193 --> 01:57.927
Next thing I know, I was bailing
through skating nuns

01:57.993 --> 02:00.633
and bouncing off flagpoles
of many nations.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.367
Ivan, are you okay?

02:03.433 --> 02:06.100
Yes, getting fired
took my mind off the pain.

02:07.467 --> 02:09.433
They fired you
for havin' an accident?

02:09.500 --> 02:11.467
Well, actually, it wasn't
just because of the accident.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.100
See, I've been on probation
'cause I hang out here

02:13.167 --> 02:15.333
all the time.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.600
Well, the important thing
is that you're alright.

02:18.666 --> 02:21.933
I mean, whether or not
you delivered my packages

02:22.000 --> 02:24.600
not nearly, you know,
as important.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.200
Oh, I delivered your package.

02:28.267 --> 02:30.833
I mean...
sure, my bike was totaled

02:30.900 --> 02:34.600
and I had to fashion this splint
out of a kid's hockey stick

02:34.667 --> 02:38.400
but I didn't want "Flavor"
to suffer just because I was.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.767
Right. How noble.

02:40.833 --> 02:44.033
And why don't you just sit here
and tell Synclaire all about it.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.167
Without that job, I don't know
how I'mma pay for my tuition.

02:50.967 --> 02:54.000
You know what? I'm gonna
ask Khadijah to give you a job.

02:54.067 --> 02:56.600
You just wait right here.
Woo‐woo‐woo.

03:00.407 --> 03:04.240
Khadijah, I think
you should hire Ivan.

03:04.307 --> 03:06.607
Without a job he's gonna
have to drop out of college

03:06.673 --> 03:09.607
and become..
Well, you know, a dropout.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.340
Synclaire,
I'm sure Ivan can manage.

03:13.407 --> 03:15.707
He's rather resourceful.

03:15.773 --> 03:17.073
Khadijah?

03:18.807 --> 03:20.373
Can I wash your car
for some spare change?

03:20.440 --> 03:21.840
I still have a good hand.

03:24.707 --> 03:26.973
Ivan, please,
I wouldn't make you wash my car

03:27.040 --> 03:28.473
in your condition.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.973
But when your other hand heals

03:30.040 --> 03:32.040
come back with a sponge
and some Armor All.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.707
Okay, Khadijah, I understand
why you won't make room for me

03:36.773 --> 03:38.307
here at "Flavor."

03:38.373 --> 03:41.140
So what if I'm top
of my sophomore class

03:41.207 --> 03:43.807
news editor of the school paper,
and have a fire in my belly

03:43.873 --> 03:45.807
big enough to fry a pork chop?

03:47.873 --> 03:50.007
By the way,
this story is not accurate.

03:50.073 --> 03:51.540
What do you mean "Not accurate?"

03:51.607 --> 03:52.907
Well, it says here
that "Gordon Berry

03:52.973 --> 03:56.773
the CEO of City Gem Records
has huge plans for the company."

03:56.840 --> 03:58.340
Well, I happen to know
he's moving to Halogen Records

03:58.407 --> 04:00.140
and takin'
most of his artists with him.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.447
Stay away from my copy,
you dizzy‐limpin' sophomore.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.347
While I was makin' a delivery
to the New York Athletic Club

04:08.413 --> 04:10.647
I heard his attorney
braggin' about the deal.

04:10.713 --> 04:11.713
Well, thanks, Ivan

04:11.780 --> 04:13.113
but I'm gonna
have to take the word

04:13.180 --> 04:14.213
of my music editor

04:14.280 --> 04:15.747
over that of a messenger

04:15.813 --> 04:17.947
who just had major head trauma.

04:18.012 --> 04:20.047
Listen, Khadijah,
with all due respect

04:20.113 --> 04:22.180
and an almost fanatical worship

04:22.247 --> 04:24.247
you're about to make
two big mistakes.

04:24.313 --> 04:27.047
One, not hiring me,
and two, runnin' that article.

04:27.113 --> 04:29.813
No, no, no,
I've only made one mistake.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.247
And that's not getting
a restraining order against you.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.713
Cheerio.

04:35.713 --> 04:36.813
Look here, Max

04:36.880 --> 04:38.380
you wanna play
the highest stakes table

04:38.446 --> 04:39.647
in Atlantic City

04:39.713 --> 04:41.947
you gotta keep
your roll civilized.

04:42.013 --> 04:43.747
Hold the dice gingerly

04:43.813 --> 04:45.480
and release.

04:45.547 --> 04:47.547
Now, give it a shot.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.347
Ha!

04:52.413 --> 04:54.347
[phone ringing]

04:55.913 --> 04:57.613
Alright, snake eyes.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.113
Hello.

04:59.180 --> 05:00.753
Oh, hey, Jeff, what's up?

05:00.820 --> 05:02.653
Oh, she had a baby boy?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.253
Oh, well, good for you.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.853
Alright, man.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.053
Isn't that's something?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.087
Woman goes through
nine months of pregnancy

05:09.153 --> 05:12.187
two days of labor,
and he gives the man props.

05:13.953 --> 05:15.520
Oh, come on, give him credit.

05:15.587 --> 05:18.220
He was involved in the process
for about 18 seconds.

05:19.287 --> 05:20.587
Ha!

05:20.653 --> 05:23.220
Oh, yeah, man, he's right here,
hold on a second.

05:23.287 --> 05:24.720
Kyle, Jeff, man.

05:26.687 --> 05:29.253
Hey...Obie, dobie, doo.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.787
Hey, baby.

05:30.853 --> 05:33.020
Hey, remember my partner,
Jeff, from Cleveland?

05:33.087 --> 05:34.720
Yes, uh, the one you call your

05:34.787 --> 05:36.720
"Ace‐number‐one
home‐apple‐scrapple."

05:36.787 --> 05:39.087
Mm‐hm. Well, his wife, Sylvia

05:39.153 --> 05:41.520
just gave birth to a baby boy.

05:41.587 --> 05:44.520
Hey, Kyle, you look like
he told you the baby was yours.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.887
In a way, it is, they just
asked me to be the godfather.

05:49.953 --> 05:53.687
What? Jeff Moesby asked you
to be the baby's godfather?

05:53.753 --> 05:55.653
Hey, OJ, I'm just
as surprised as you are.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.653
I thought you'd be
the natural choice, you know?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.127
Obie, didn't you drag Jeff
and his entire family

06:01.193 --> 06:03.127
from a burning house?

06:05.193 --> 06:08.693
Not the entire family, the dog
jetted before I got there.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.527
Look, Overton, if this is gonna
bother you, you know

06:12.593 --> 06:14.327
maybe I should call
Jeff back and pass on

06:14.393 --> 06:15.727
this whole godfather thing.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.093
No, man, that's alright.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.593
I just thought that Jeff
and I had a understanding

06:20.660 --> 06:22.660
you know, he said that
if he ever had a baby

06:22.727 --> 06:24.027
I'd be the godfather.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.827
But guess you can't expect
a man to keep a promise he made

06:26.893 --> 06:29.527
while you're administering CPR.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.393
Lord, we're beaten
by the "Village Voice."

06:36.560 --> 06:40.260
"City Gem chief Gordon Berry
heads to Halogen."

06:40.327 --> 06:41.660
Ugh!

06:41.727 --> 06:44.693
Should have listened
to the hop‐along messenger boy.

06:45.993 --> 06:47.860
Alright, alright, Russell,
we gotta get Khadijah

06:47.927 --> 06:50.193
in a good mood
before she reads this.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.460
Oh, okay, I know what.

06:52.527 --> 06:55.660
"The Big Book of Brain Teaser."
She loves these.

06:58.727 --> 07:01.000
Khadijah, question.

07:01.067 --> 07:04.267
In the "Temptation" song
Papa was a rolling stone

07:04.333 --> 07:07.767
they say
"All he left us was alone."

07:07.833 --> 07:10.400
Now, did they mean alone
without a father

07:10.467 --> 07:13.067
or a loan you get from a bank?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.233
Russell..

07:15.433 --> 07:16.500
...what's goin' on?

07:16.567 --> 07:17.567
Uh, I think that meant

07:17.633 --> 07:18.967
left alone without a father.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.867
Ah, that's it.
I think exactly what they meant.

07:21.933 --> 07:25.067
Look, if this is about
the "Village Voice" article

07:25.133 --> 07:26.667
I'm not happy about it.

07:26.733 --> 07:29.933
But every magazine makes
a mistake now and then, right?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.133
Exactly.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.433
Okay, so just write up
a correction.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.933
Should I blame you
or everybody but me?

07:41.233 --> 07:44.433
You know, I'm a little confused.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.833
"Flavor" has a big article
on Gordon Berry leading

07:46.900 --> 07:49.033
City Gem Records
into the next century

07:49.100 --> 07:52.800
while "The Voice"
has the same Gordon Berry

07:52.867 --> 07:54.033
moving to Halogen Records.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.167
Well, looks like
somebody is wasting

07:55.233 --> 07:58.233
a lot of newsprint here.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.907
Ivan, next time
you wanna say, "I told you so"

08:00.973 --> 08:03.573
call me,
so I can hang up on you.

08:04.707 --> 08:06.407
See, Khadijah

08:06.473 --> 08:07.807
there's that stinging wit

08:07.873 --> 08:10.207
you usually save
for us employees.

08:10.273 --> 08:13.707
You want Ivan to work here,
don't you?

08:13.773 --> 08:16.307
That's the way to make up
for crippling him for life.

08:16.373 --> 08:18.140
Ow! Ow!

08:20.207 --> 08:22.940
So maybe you know
how to spot a story.

08:23.007 --> 08:24.407
I'll tell you what

08:24.473 --> 08:27.407
when you feel up to it, maybe
we have a place here for you.

08:31.907 --> 08:33.506
I'm ready now.

08:34.273 --> 08:35.607
Good.

08:35.673 --> 08:38.307
Take these, staple 'em, copy 'em

08:38.373 --> 08:40.307
and get 'em over
to the layout desk.

08:41.773 --> 08:43.673
You're been hired
as a copy aide.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.973
Wait a minute.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.373
I can't get a Pulitzer Prize
doing this.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.207
Don't I get to write anything?

08:50.273 --> 08:51.740
Well, if you come up
with something

08:51.807 --> 08:54.707
that isn't garbage, maybe.

08:54.773 --> 08:56.140
Oh, wait a minute,
y‐you said "Maybe"

08:56.207 --> 08:58.440
that's‐that's one step
closer to probably.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.880
Khadijah, I can see it now.

09:01.947 --> 09:04.447
You and I, side by side

09:04.513 --> 09:07.280
sniffing out stories
and writing till night

09:07.347 --> 09:08.813
falling asleep
in each other's arms

09:08.880 --> 09:11.413
and wakin' up for another day
of reportin' and snuggling.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.147
Synclaire, when you visit me
at the sanitarium

09:17.213 --> 09:19.180
just make sure they do my hair

09:19.247 --> 09:21.280
and wipe the drool off my chin.

09:26.047 --> 09:28.113
You know,
I can't believe you still eat

09:28.180 --> 09:30.080
that dead animal flesh.

09:30.147 --> 09:32.347
You really should consider
becoming a vegetarian.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.847
The chicken was a vegetarian.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.213
Every time I take
a big bite outta this

09:42.280 --> 09:44.780
I get all the vegetables it had.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.413
Hey‐hey, everybody.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.147
Oh. Oh. Oh!

09:52.213 --> 09:54.547
Kyle, a little monster truck

09:54.613 --> 09:56.880
to go with your
little monster woman.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.687
I just stopped by the toy store,
I want to make sure

10:02.753 --> 10:05.720
my godchild has
all the finer things in life.

10:05.787 --> 10:07.720
You should resign immediately..

10:09.053 --> 10:10.320
...honey.

10:11.687 --> 10:13.387
Forget it, Ivan.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.687
That is the fifteenth time
Ivan has called

10:16.753 --> 10:18.687
with stupid story ideas.

10:18.753 --> 10:22.287
This time he wants to go
undercover as a woman

10:22.353 --> 10:24.553
at the
Miss Black America pageant

10:24.620 --> 10:26.620
to expose corruption.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.153
Oh, you know something,
I've always

10:29.220 --> 10:30.620
wondered about that thing.

10:30.687 --> 10:33.487
Like, how come there's
never a Black Miss Utah?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.087
Hey, Kyle,
you just missed a call upstairs

10:40.153 --> 10:42.687
from your godson's father.

10:42.753 --> 10:44.920
Wanted to know
something about a list.

10:44.987 --> 10:47.287
Oh‐oh, right, right, right,
I'm still workin' on it.

10:47.353 --> 10:51.053
Um, I have the honor of choosing
my godson's middle name.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.853
Oh, isn't that sweet?

10:54.053 --> 10:56.853
Well, let's hear
what you got, god‐papa.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.720
Alright, number one‐‐

10:59.787 --> 11:02.427
And for your own dignity's sake,
don't say it's Kyle.

11:06.327 --> 11:08.293
I'm still on the fence
about number one.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.793
Number two, is Lloyd.

11:11.860 --> 11:15.560
Lloyd, a handsome name
with a silent 'L.'

11:15.627 --> 11:17.027
And all the kids in the school

11:17.093 --> 11:19.627
gonna beat that child silly
with that silent 'L.'

11:21.860 --> 11:24.927
Number three, is Boyd.

11:24.993 --> 11:29.093
W‐wha‐what is Boyd,
but boy with a 'D' on the end?

11:29.160 --> 11:32.560
Shorty, did you put
any kind of thought into this?

11:32.627 --> 11:34.293
Hello. Tension?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.627
Oh, Lord, look at the next one.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.360
Cecil.

11:41.327 --> 11:44.193
It is pronounced, Cecil.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.227
Oh, that's cool, so instead
of calling him a sissy

11:47.293 --> 11:49.893
the other hoodlums
will just call him "Sissy."

11:52.960 --> 11:55.460
Lovely. Lovely.

11:55.527 --> 11:57.127
Oh, hey, hey, hey, look, man.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.867
I'm just tryin' to be
a good godfather, alright?

11:59.933 --> 12:01.900
[chuckles]

12:01.967 --> 12:04.333
Well, I,
I guess I had it all wrong

12:04.400 --> 12:06.300
Mr. Smooth Shorty Slick.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.167
See, I was in the basement

12:09.233 --> 12:10.933
tryin' to come up with a crib

12:11.000 --> 12:12.633
that converts into a playpen

12:12.700 --> 12:15.633
that eventually turns into
a soapbox racer

12:15.700 --> 12:17.500
for those difficult tween years

12:17.567 --> 12:18.667
when I should have been up here

12:18.733 --> 12:20.033
comin' up with corny name

12:20.100 --> 12:21.867
that will guarantee
the boy be named

12:21.933 --> 12:24.000
"The boy most likely
to get his butt whooped

12:24.067 --> 12:25.733
over a carton of milk."

12:35.467 --> 12:38.867
Now, why didn't I
think of this earlier?

12:38.933 --> 12:42.967
I sent Ivan up to a celebrity
hair‐cutting benefit in Harlem.

12:43.033 --> 12:46.300
And bam...my headache is gone.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.400
Hey, copy aide.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.633
You should
have your barber beaten.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.133
What the hell happened to you?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.067
Oh, people just seem to open up
more if you let them release

12:59.133 --> 13:00.740
your natural curl pattern.

13:02.107 --> 13:04.573
And I have uncovered
the scoop of the year.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.940
Well, unless God dropped by
the hairathon for extensions

13:08.007 --> 13:09.440
I don't wanna hear it.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.840
Well, close to God.

13:11.907 --> 13:13.707
Reverend Jesse Jackson
is about to be appointed

13:13.773 --> 13:16.573
to a cabinet position.
I got it from the man himself.

13:18.407 --> 13:21.140
Jesse Jackson
was at a hairathon.

13:21.207 --> 13:23.440
And told you he was gettin'
a cabinet position?

13:23.507 --> 13:26.040
Yeah. He was sitting
right next to Al Sharpton.

13:28.173 --> 13:29.573
I have it on tape.

13:31.407 --> 13:34.473
(Jesse)
'Racism, hypnotism.'

13:34.540 --> 13:36.340
That's Jesse, alright.

13:36.407 --> 13:38.907
(Jesse)
'Oh, yes, I'm very excited
about the new cabinet position.'

13:38.973 --> 13:41.540
'We're gonna do
a lot of new exciting things.'

13:41.607 --> 13:43.140
'Now, if you'll excuse me,
Reverend Sharpton'

13:43.207 --> 13:44.973
'Don King needs my chair.'

13:46.007 --> 13:47.273
Ivan, this is good stuff.

13:47.340 --> 13:48.840
Did you get
the other confirmation?

13:48.907 --> 13:50.073
Well, no.
I came right back here.

13:50.140 --> 13:51.940
I knew we had a deadline.

13:52.007 --> 13:53.207
Oh, we gotta verify this.

13:53.273 --> 13:54.740
I'll get on the phone
with the White House.

13:54.807 --> 13:56.273
You get on the phone
with Jesse's people.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.940
Oh, this is so exciting.

13:58.007 --> 13:59.480
I'll make coffee!

13:59.547 --> 14:02.480
[instrumental music]

14:29.747 --> 14:32.413
Alright. I just got off
the phone with Jesse's people

14:32.480 --> 14:34.180
and he said "No comment"
and hung up.

14:34.247 --> 14:36.847
Pfft. Well, I just got off
the phone with the White House.

14:36.913 --> 14:39.113
They said they can
neither confirm nor deny.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.513
That's the standard smokescreen
for, "Uh‐oh, we got busted."

14:42.580 --> 14:45.513
For my part, it's the best damn
cup of coffee I've ever made.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.747
So what are we gonna do, boss?

14:49.813 --> 14:51.413
Tell you what we're gonna do

14:51.480 --> 14:55.180
this little monthly is about to
scoop the hell out of everyone.

14:55.247 --> 14:56.747
"The Voice," "The Times."

14:57.813 --> 15:00.620
Hell, we're gonna
scoop the world!

15:00.687 --> 15:02.620
Isn't this one of those moments
that you get so caught up in it

15:02.687 --> 15:04.087
you grab
the closest person to you

15:04.153 --> 15:06.087
and you give him
a big wet kiss on the mouth?

15:08.553 --> 15:09.853
You know, you're right.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.020
Uh‐oh, oops,
that moment just passed.

15:12.087 --> 15:13.353
Get to work.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.287
Coffee?

15:23.387 --> 15:25.620
Hey, hey, anybody call?

15:25.687 --> 15:27.253
Um, just, umm..

15:27.320 --> 15:29.320
Uh, Marlon Brando called.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.753
Said he was depressed
that you a better

15:30.820 --> 15:32.253
godfather than he was.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.987
Oh, so you're still trippin',
I see, huh?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.753
Naw, you the one
that's trippin', Fredo.

15:41.453 --> 15:43.187
And that big creature you got
there ain't gonna do nothing

15:43.253 --> 15:45.253
but scare the bejesus
out that child.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.087
You know, Overton, I'm about
sick and tired of you makin' out

15:49.153 --> 15:51.220
like I'm the world's
worst godfather.

15:51.287 --> 15:53.453
Well, I don't know
about worst, but‐‐

15:53.520 --> 15:55.553
Look, look, man,
this means a lot to me, alright?

15:55.620 --> 15:57.920
And you could at least
be a little bit happy for me.

15:57.987 --> 16:01.160
Well, I mean, I guess
I am a little happy for you.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.227
And, heaven forbid, anything
happen to Jeff and Sylvia.

16:04.293 --> 16:07.060
Sure you'd do a wonderful job
raising that kid.

16:07.127 --> 16:08.527
Yeah, thank you.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.327
Wai‐wait, wha‐wait,
wai‐wai‐wait, wha‐wha‐what..

16:11.393 --> 16:13.760
What do you mean "Raising?"
Raisin' the kid?

16:13.827 --> 16:16.193
Man, that's the godfather's
most sacred duty.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.960
If anything happen
to the parents, you the man.

16:20.093 --> 16:22.327
Uh‐uh.

16:22.393 --> 16:24.727
Oh, wha‐wha‐what, wha‐what
kind of madness is that, man?

16:24.793 --> 16:27.093
No, look, all I thought
I had to do was buy the kid

16:27.160 --> 16:28.393
a few presents, you know.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.993
Uh, make sure
I remember his birthdays

16:30.060 --> 16:32.427
and when he turns 21, take him
to his first strip club.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.327
Shorty, relax.

16:35.393 --> 16:37.893
Jeff and Sylvia
are the picture of health, man.

16:38.660 --> 16:39.960
No, they are not, man.

16:40.027 --> 16:41.693
Jeff has asthma and Sylvia..

16:41.760 --> 16:44.760
Well, let's face it,
girlie weighs 320 pounds.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.293
Naw, she's about 340.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.827
She's been eatin' 'em
biscuits, man.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.593
Man, whatever. You know,
girlie would choke on a pot pie

16:51.660 --> 16:53.827
fall on Jeff and bam,
the kid is mine.

16:55.427 --> 16:58.593
Oh, nothing's going to happen,
I mean, even if it did..

16:58.660 --> 17:01.167
You've been in that big brother
program for three years

17:01.233 --> 17:04.067
and look Kevon's not
entirely screwed up, is he?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.733
Hm, he isn't, is he?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.532
Except for his tendency
to wanna lay

17:08.599 --> 17:10.933
his head on Synclaire's chest.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.700
Can you blame him?

17:14.267 --> 17:18.333
Um, Overton, look, man, this,
this is a huge responsibility

17:18.400 --> 17:21.400
and if I'm gonna handle it,
I'm gonna need your help.

17:21.467 --> 17:24.166
Sure, you want me to be
sort of like a..

17:24.233 --> 17:25.700
...god‐coach?

17:25.767 --> 17:26.967
Hey.

17:27.032 --> 17:29.800
Well, man, guess if I can't
be the godfather

17:29.867 --> 17:31.567
being the god‐coach
is the next best thing.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.667
‐ There you go.
‐ Cool.

17:32.733 --> 17:33.833
Alright, cool.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.133
And my first act as god‐coach is

17:36.200 --> 17:38.233
to congratulate you
on getting over

17:38.300 --> 17:40.767
that crush you had on Sylvia
back in high school.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.667
Brother,
you dodged one big bullet.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.667
Whoo! I'm telling you, man.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.067
[indistinct chattering]

17:47.600 --> 17:49.400
Nothin' in "The Voice"
about Jesse Jackson

17:49.467 --> 17:51.233
gettin' a cabinet post.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.900
[chuckles]
Jet missed the boat.

17:53.967 --> 17:57.500
And not a word
in "The New York Times."

17:57.567 --> 18:00.373
Uh, except this
in the home section.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.673
The home section?

18:01.740 --> 18:03.907
It's an article about
Jesse Jackson's plans

18:03.973 --> 18:05.707
to re‐design his kitchen.

18:05.773 --> 18:09.673
Quote, "I'm thrilled about
the new cabinet position."

18:12.740 --> 18:14.607
"Once everything is in place,
we'll be able to do

18:14.673 --> 18:17.440
"some new exciting things like

18:17.507 --> 18:20.440
have an entire shelf
just for cereal."

18:23.140 --> 18:24.607
This is the most
embarrassing moment

18:24.673 --> 18:27.007
in the history of "Flavor."

18:27.073 --> 18:29.007
I told you
the hobblin' messenger boy

18:29.073 --> 18:30.840
was trouble from the start.

18:33.573 --> 18:35.273
Synclaire, call the distributor.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.040
Tell him to bundle up
all the magazines

18:37.107 --> 18:39.107
and send them back.

18:39.173 --> 18:41.273
We're gonna have to eat
costs on this one.

18:42.507 --> 18:44.273
[whistling]

18:45.173 --> 18:46.640
Oh..

18:46.707 --> 18:48.573
Wassup, Scoop?

18:48.640 --> 18:49.640
[sighs]

18:49.707 --> 18:50.740
I figured I'd come in and get

18:50.807 --> 18:52.707
a few advance copies
of "Flavor."

18:52.773 --> 18:55.540
One for my professor,
a couple for my family.

18:55.607 --> 18:57.373
And I'll take the remainder
and just run up and down

18:57.440 --> 18:59.847
the street yelling,
"Extra, extra!"

19:01.013 --> 19:03.013
Try runnin' up and down
the street yellin'

19:03.080 --> 19:05.513
"I'm a goat head!
I'm a goat head!"

19:13.213 --> 19:14.813
‐ Ay, oh.
‐ Ah‐ha!

19:14.880 --> 19:16.013
Hey, you guys.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.413
I was at the video store's
return bin

19:18.480 --> 19:20.947
for 20 minutes
waitin' on this movie, so..

19:21.013 --> 19:22.847
I'm gonna turn off
whatever tired little thing

19:22.913 --> 19:24.213
you all are watchin'.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.780
And pop this in.

19:26.847 --> 19:27.947
[sighs]

19:28.013 --> 19:29.980
"Faint pulse,"
that's a good flick.

19:30.047 --> 19:32.147
I never really got
the ending though.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.113
Quintella was the murderer.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.880
The reason why they found
the lipstick on the lamp

19:35.947 --> 19:38.113
is because one of his multiple
personalities was a woman.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.413
[gasps]
Oh, my God! That's a shocker.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.380
You are a virus with braids.

19:50.613 --> 19:52.547
And you're a leprechaun
with a weave.

20:01.253 --> 20:03.853
Hey, hey, you think that
chocolate pudding is ready yet?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.287
No, not yet, not yet.

20:05.353 --> 20:06.487
‐ Let's go drink it anyway.
‐ I was hoping you'd say that.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.753
‐ Alright.
‐ Ah!

20:08.820 --> 20:10.353
[knock on the door]

20:15.020 --> 20:16.853
Ivan, what are you doin' here?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.953
I just stopped by
to tell you that, um..

20:19.020 --> 20:21.053
I'm givin' up journalism.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.020
And I'm gonna join
my father's business.

20:24.087 --> 20:26.187
He runs the sloth exhibit
at the Yonkers zoo.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.053
[sighs]
Ivan, please, stop the drama.

20:32.853 --> 20:35.220
Look, "Flavor" is my magazine.

20:35.287 --> 20:36.953
I decided to run the article

20:37.020 --> 20:39.420
that makes me responsible.

20:39.487 --> 20:41.320
Well, yeah, that's true,
but it was my story.

20:41.387 --> 20:43.587
Yeah, but I should
have known better.

20:43.653 --> 20:46.320
You have absolutely
no experience at all.

20:46.387 --> 20:49.420
You have no idea
what you're doin'.

20:50.687 --> 20:51.953
So what you're sayin' is that

20:52.020 --> 20:53.387
you want me to stay at "Flavor"

20:53.453 --> 20:54.953
and you realize
that you're lookin'

20:55.020 --> 20:57.053
into the eyes of your soulmate.

20:59.193 --> 21:00.793
Yes, for the first part.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.827
Fool, get a grip, to the second.

21:04.293 --> 21:05.427
Thanks, Khadijah.

21:05.493 --> 21:06.593
You're just the beacon of hope

21:06.660 --> 21:09.360
with a body that won't quit,
aren't you?

21:09.427 --> 21:11.993
Ivan, before you pour it on
any thicker

21:12.060 --> 21:14.193
I have another
