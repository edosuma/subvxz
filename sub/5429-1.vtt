What did she say?

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:32.059
She said, "Throw
the piano overboard."

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.859
It's quite safe. They are managing.

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:40.619
She doesn't want it.
She says it's spoiled!

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:44.579
I've been given the key.
I'll have it mended.

You will regret it. It's your piano,
I want you to have it.

01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:04.299
She doesn't want it!
Ada, sit down! Sit down!

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:08.899
Throw it over!
Sit down!

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.219
Alright, we'll throw it over.

What a chance.

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.459
What a surprise.

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.699
My will has chosen life.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:07.019
Still, it has had me spooked,
and many others besides.

And sometimes of myself
floating above it.

Down there, everything
is so still and silent
