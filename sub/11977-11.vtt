00:06.630 --> 00:08.060
<i>Previously... on Rogue..</i>.

00:08.150 --> 00:09.690
This is my mom, Harper.

00:09.690 --> 00:11.680
She was in the state hospital.

00:11.690 --> 00:16.219
Marty says, "Fuck that." Next
day, she is in this private joint,

00:16.219 --> 00:18.380
round-the-clock nurses.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.950
All I had to do was keep
him informed about the Kings.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.520
That's the real leader
of the 13th Street Kings.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.030
Marty Stein.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.190
Marty Stein is using the Kings

00:26.200 --> 00:30.200
to steal U.S. military weapons
en route to Chicago P.D.

00:30.200 --> 00:34.530
It's small arms warfare from here to
eternity, and I want in on that fun.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.670
So, you're running guns
into a holy war, is that it?

00:36.680 --> 00:39.310
I want those guns back. And
I can't get 'em without you.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.310
I just want my...

00:40.750 --> 00:42.050
Ahhh!

00:42.050 --> 00:43.920
Let me see your fucking hands!

00:43.920 --> 00:45.520
But there is something I can get you,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.520
something you cannot get for yourself,

00:47.520 --> 00:48.310
- someth...
- And what's that?

00:48.320 --> 00:49.980
A United States senator.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.490
So, what're you gonna do
with the money I gave you?

00:51.490 --> 00:53.350
Maybe getting back into
the intelligence business.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.400
Maybe you'd be my first client.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.770
We need you to tell Marlon you
know where Leo's hiding out.

00:57.770 --> 00:59.490
- I do?
- We're gonna give you an address

00:59.500 --> 01:01.400
where we'll be waiting.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.530
- D.E.A.!
- Drop your weapon.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.740
Drop your fucking weapon.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.170
Who ordered the hit on Leo?

01:05.170 --> 01:06.900
Marlon Dinard.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.740
- We can stop this right now.
- It's too fucking late.

01:08.740 --> 01:10.600
- Where is he?
- Fuck you!

01:10.610 --> 01:11.610
Where...

01:12.850 --> 01:15.350
Somebody killed Talia.

01:15.350 --> 01:18.020
Your client was found at the crime
scene, holding the body of the victim.

01:18.020 --> 01:21.290
The defendant will be held without bail.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.390
Family. What the fuck is wrong with you!

01:23.390 --> 01:24.860
The fuck do you know about family?

01:26.030 --> 01:28.260
Oh, my God.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.980
Your lawyer, Marty Stein, is exactly
what I need to talk to you about.

01:31.730 --> 01:32.730
Listen.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.510
Libby?

02:56.520 --> 02:57.520
You know who I am.

02:58.850 --> 03:00.450
You've been trying to find me for a week.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.470
Well, it appears I've found you.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.780
Actually, I found you.

03:07.490 --> 03:08.750
- Okay.
- What do you want?

03:09.730 --> 03:11.600
Me? Nothing.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.800
- Let me...
- I wouldn't.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.410
Go ahead. Test me.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.800
I was just gonna give you my card.

03:25.650 --> 03:27.080
My name is Ethan Kelly.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.980
Burns Wagner send you?

03:28.980 --> 03:31.240
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.250
So, what are you? C.I.A.?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.050
F.B.I.?

03:36.060 --> 03:38.360
Greg Barrett hired me to find you, Libby.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.460
Greg Barrett?

03:40.930 --> 03:42.130
Fuck me.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.390
You're from the N.S.A., right?

04:05.220 --> 04:06.590
Mom! Mom!

04:07.350 --> 04:08.380
Whoa, hey!

04:10.720 --> 04:11.950
Get off the fucking bike!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.680
Get off the bike! Back
up, back the fuck up!

04:31.780 --> 04:33.310
What do you want from me, Bernie?

04:33.310 --> 04:35.040
How could I know it's gonna
rain for 20 days in Malaysia?

04:35.050 --> 04:36.050
How could I know that?

04:37.420 --> 04:39.220
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Sir?

04:39.220 --> 04:42.760
Sir, you can't go in there.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.200
On my mother's eyes, Bernie. How
long have we known each other?

04:46.130 --> 04:47.630
So what? You're gonna come...

04:47.630 --> 04:48.800
No... Jesus!

04:51.930 --> 04:53.690
- I just got fucking shot at, Greg.
- Hey! Okay.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.100
Now, who is Libby Hendricks, really?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.000
- And don't fucking lie to me.
- I'm not lying to you!

04:59.010 --> 05:00.680
You're not fucking lying to me?

05:00.680 --> 05:03.470
- She's not some ex-girlfriend, is she?
- Okay, I lied to you.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.560
But I had a good reason I
couldn't tell you the truth.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.150
I'm listening.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.080
Do you know what a margin call is?

05:11.080 --> 05:13.010
Of course I know what a margin call is.

05:13.020 --> 05:14.420
Okay, well, I'm in the
hole a lot of money,

05:14.420 --> 05:17.820
and I don't get it back,
I'm done, I'm finished.

05:17.820 --> 05:20.990
Who is Libby Hendricks? You're
not answering my question.

05:20.990 --> 05:23.290
- You're not answering my fucking...
- She was my golden goose.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.170
- Go on.
- She had this flash drive, had an algorithm on it.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.600
Back door to Burns Wagner, nobody
knew about it, no one could trace it.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.800
Who is Burns Wagner?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.500
They're a consultancy firm.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.200
Their biggest client, their
only client, is the N.S.A.

05:34.210 --> 05:37.450
So, she had the keys to the
whole fucking world. In real time.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.440
She could read emails, text
messages, phone calls, anything.

05:40.450 --> 05:41.780
What did it look like?

05:41.780 --> 05:43.710
It was silver. Tiny.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.690
Size of nothing. You could
fit it into a laptop...

05:45.690 --> 05:48.360
Boom. I could do no wrong.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.160
And you were using it for
insider trading, is that right?

05:51.160 --> 05:53.760
She had secret information, I
traded on it. We made a lot of money.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.690
So, what's the problem, Greg?

05:56.700 --> 05:58.400
Well, I spent a lot more.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.230
I thought the good times would never end.

06:00.230 --> 06:02.030
Now I'm in the hole, bitch
disappeared. She cleared me out.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.170
She played you.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.250
Let me ask you a question.
How were you gonna pay me?

06:06.810 --> 06:08.410
I have some personal funds.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.080
Do you?

06:10.080 --> 06:11.880
Well, guess what? Now it's double.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.050
And I want $25,000.00,
and I want it right now.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.990
- How am I gonna get $25...
- I know you've got some get out of town cash,

06:16.980 --> 06:18.180
and I want it right now, Greg.

06:32.230 --> 06:33.230
There's $20,000.00.

06:40.510 --> 06:42.430
Security contract at this
firm is up for renewal.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.080
Must be worth of couple million dollars.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.400
That's why you're doing this,
right? Help with your startup?

06:50.420 --> 06:52.720
You do this for me,

06:52.720 --> 06:55.120
you find Libby, you find that
flash drive before anyone else does,

06:55.120 --> 06:57.480
and I'll get you that
contract. Guaranteed.

07:00.690 --> 07:02.150
I'll see what I can do, Greg.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.960
I first met Talia when
she was 11 years old.

07:12.970 --> 07:15.970
She was sitting on the
steps outside the courthouse,

07:15.980 --> 07:17.280
flipping a quarter.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.140
I said to her,

07:21.150 --> 07:24.790
"If you can make that come up
heads, I will give you a dollar."

07:24.790 --> 07:26.650
She said, "Make it $5.00,
and you got a deal."

07:27.920 --> 07:30.380
Before the afternoon was over,

07:30.390 --> 07:34.060
she had $60 of my hard-earned
dollars in her pocket

07:34.060 --> 07:36.060
and an ice cream sundae in her belly.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.830
That was Talia.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.570
She knew what she wanted.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.730
And she usually got it.

07:45.740 --> 07:47.610
And a fucking crook... Where is he?

07:47.610 --> 07:49.680
And you stick your fucking
nose in everybody's business,

07:49.680 --> 07:51.480
and you destroy everything.
We can stop this, you know that?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.580
We can stop this right now.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.750
It's too fucking late. He's
probably in cuffs right now.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.020
Where is he? You're about to join him.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.590
- Where is he?
- Fuck you!

07:58.590 --> 08:01.020
Where...

08:05.430 --> 08:09.000
You've had 2 weeks to think
about our offer, Marlon.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.730
We know Marty Stein killed Talia.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.530
You know he killed Talia.

08:17.940 --> 08:21.710
Best case, he pleads down to negligent
homicide, does a couple years, tops.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.180
Worst case, he convinces a jury
this was all a tragic accident.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.150
And walks.

08:26.150 --> 08:28.780
If you cooperate, we can build
a R.I.C.O. case against him.

08:28.780 --> 08:32.140
He'll get 20, minimum.

08:32.150 --> 08:34.230
It won't hurt your
sentencing either, Marlon.

08:36.190 --> 08:39.330
Now, why you're continuing to protect
that son of a bitch is beyond me, son.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.860
What goes on between me and
Marty is between me and Marty.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.130
Let's raise our glasses.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.260
To Talia Freeman.

08:47.670 --> 08:51.170
You are a beautiful ray of sunshine,

08:51.170 --> 08:54.340
and the world will be a
dimmer place without you in it.

09:05.820 --> 09:06.820
Thank you, Marty.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.280
Can I get you something?

09:11.160 --> 09:13.530
What about Marlon?

09:13.530 --> 09:15.330
Do you think you can get him out?

09:15.330 --> 09:18.530
I will do my best. You know that.

09:18.530 --> 09:21.430
- You believe he's innocent, right?
- Yes, of course I do.

09:21.430 --> 09:25.000
And I've already made a
motion to dismiss the charges.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.110
We have to find out who
did this. We have to.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.540
I promise you I will.

09:31.540 --> 09:34.210
I miss her.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.680
- I miss her so...
- I know. I know, sweetie.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.190
I know.

09:46.060 --> 09:49.970
Listen to me, Marlon. If anything
happens to Marty, when you finish this 20,

09:49.970 --> 09:53.220
I promise they'll have another
20-to-life staring you in the face.

09:53.230 --> 09:55.630
So, you really don't have a choice.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.040
This is America, man.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.380
A man always got a choice.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.820
That son of a bitch has got
balls, I'll give him that.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.350
- He'll come around.
- Will he?

10:19.390 --> 10:21.620
What if he doesn't?

10:21.630 --> 10:23.100
Maybe we should just pick up Stein

10:23.100 --> 10:26.100
before Marlon's boys execute
their own kind of justice.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.340
No way. That prick'll have a jury
convinced she slipped on a banana,

10:28.340 --> 10:30.260
and hit her head on the TV.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.670
I want Stein behind bars, boss.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.430
Well, find me an
eyewitness, a hair follicle,

10:33.440 --> 10:35.140
something that will
nail his ass to a wall.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.750
Marty. Come on in.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.140
Hey.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.450
- How are ya?
- Good, you?

10:48.450 --> 10:50.480
Well, not so bad, considering.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.190
You want a drink?

10:52.190 --> 10:53.470
Just a taste, if you don't mind.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.500
Wow. Look at this place!

10:59.500 --> 11:00.600
It's not bad, huh?

11:00.600 --> 11:01.940
My, my, my, my, my.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.140
There you go.

11:04.670 --> 11:05.700
Thank you.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.270
Hey.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.100
Congrats, mazel tov on your new business.

11:09.640 --> 11:10.640
Cheers.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.620
- Well, what can I do for you?
- Okay, here's the thing.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.390
I would like it very much if you
could put Marlon Dinard on your books.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.690
He's in prison, Marty.

11:22.690 --> 11:25.030
I made a motion to dismiss,
but if that doesn't work,

11:25.030 --> 11:27.950
I need to show that he's employed
full-time in order to make bail.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.830
The Feds shut down his chandelier shop...

11:29.830 --> 11:32.170
He's a murder suspect.
I'm not interested in...

11:32.170 --> 11:35.200
He doesn't have to actually work
for you, just put him on the books.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.630
And who knows? Maybe he can
come in handy for you sometime.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.340
Don't make me beg!

11:39.340 --> 11:41.040
I'm asking you, please, pretty please?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.480
Okay.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.180
- All right. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:44.180 --> 11:45.650
- Thanks, Ethan.
- You got it.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.730
I'd love to stay and
chat, but I gotta run.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.090
Hey, Ethan. Keep your nose clean, huh?

12:11.670 --> 12:14.150
- How can I help you?
- May I see your card, please?

12:19.350 --> 12:21.520
I'm sorry, sir. This card is no
longer valid for the elevator.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.510
You'll need a new one.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.240
You're going to need
to get it reauthorized.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.080
Okay, Jennifer. Let's
see what you're made of.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.610
I need a card to get into Burns Wagner.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.120
This is not gonna be easy.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.570
Hmm. I thought you said you
were good at this, Jennifer.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.190
I am. Anyone else and
it would be impossible.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.440
Good.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.640
Well, once you find Libby, you'll
have no trouble getting into

12:43.640 --> 12:45.610
Burns Wagner's personnel files.

12:45.610 --> 12:46.840
Your wish is my command.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.140
Coffee?

12:51.140 --> 12:52.540
Non-fat, 2 sugars.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.320
I thought you were a diabetic.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.980
Yeah, I know my levels.

12:57.980 --> 12:58.980
Wait.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.000
I didn't tell you I was diabetic.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.290
You don't think I research
my prospective employees?

13:07.290 --> 13:09.820
Mmm-hmm. What else do you know about me?

13:09.830 --> 13:12.100
Enough to let you into my home.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.840
Okay. So how long is this trial
period gonna last, anyways?

13:15.840 --> 13:17.610
Until you prove yourself. There you go.

13:17.610 --> 13:22.670
Thank you. Here it is... Libby Hendricks.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.110
She must have high clearance. Her
records are blocked pretty good.

13:25.110 --> 13:27.790
Find somebody with low clearance.
Somebody that's new at the company.

13:29.580 --> 13:33.280
Declan Young. Started at
the company 2 months ago.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.190
And he's not bad-looking either.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.990
Can you get into his email account?

13:36.990 --> 13:38.690
We're talking N.S.A. security here.

13:38.690 --> 13:41.790
- Okay, how about a personal account, Jen?
- Um...

13:41.790 --> 13:44.160
Nice. Listed right here on
his social media profile.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.600
Can you read it?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.760
Ever since I was a
freshman in high school.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.270
And voila.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.840
Are all men dicks? This is the
same email to 2 different women.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.600
- Hold this for a second, will you?
- What? I...

14:02.550 --> 14:04.980
Success, Jen. Well done.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.610
No problem. What did I do?

14:07.620 --> 14:10.380
Declan plays basketball at the "Y,"
every Tuesday and Thursday after work.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.160
Does this mean I get the job?

14:14.160 --> 14:15.600
We'll see, Jennifer. We'll see.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.370
I need you to sign off on this, too.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.380
Jesus, we gotta talk sometime.

14:39.390 --> 14:42.120
About what? About how
you should be in prison?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.250
I can help you, you know,

14:46.260 --> 14:47.830
catch your great white whale.

14:49.530 --> 14:50.730
Marty Stein.

14:52.570 --> 14:55.400
I don't need your help.
I don't want your help.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.060
In fact, I don't wanna
see your face anymore.

14:58.070 --> 15:02.240
Harper, I'm close to
the prick. Let me help.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.400
Here's what you're gonna do, okay?

15:04.410 --> 15:06.170
You are going to resign
from this task force.

15:07.510 --> 15:10.010
Yeah? Then what?

15:10.020 --> 15:14.390
I don't care. Go back to
C.P.D., for shit's sake.

15:14.390 --> 15:17.330
Screw with their investigations,
not mine. I am done.

15:19.630 --> 15:20.800
I want you out of here.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.190
That's the price for my silence.

15:54.930 --> 15:57.130
So, you ready, Declan?

15:57.130 --> 15:59.730
I was born ready, "G." You should
get off that phone, move your butt.

17:00.730 --> 17:03.800
I can't create a new
I.D. on such short notice.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.130
Burns Wagner has a
pretty air-tight system.

17:06.130 --> 17:09.390
It would take, like, 3 days to get
sufficient covering to forge a new one.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.560
You'll have to wait or use the original.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.170
Maybe he hasn't noticed it's missing yet.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.880
I need you to get into
the building entry log,

17:16.880 --> 17:19.349
and I need to find out when Declan
comes to work in the morning, please.

17:19.349 --> 17:20.349
Okay.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.920
Declan typically comes into
the office around 9:00 a.m.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.260
He works on the 5th floor,

17:30.260 --> 17:34.430
but his I.D. will give you access to the
7th floor, where Libby Hendricks works.

17:34.430 --> 17:35.930
- All right.
- What are you looking for, anyway?

17:35.930 --> 17:39.000
Well, anything I can find out on Libby.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.360
As soon as Declan reports this
missing, it'll be deactivated.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.840
I don't understand.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.840
I'm not really cut out for
these long, drawn out cases.

17:54.850 --> 17:57.620
Things, they move a lot quicker at C.P.D.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.250
Lieutenant said he'd have me back...

18:01.220 --> 18:02.420
Okay, well, good luck to you.

18:06.260 --> 18:07.800
You tell Correli he owes me $300.00.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.430
Finnegan.

18:12.030 --> 18:13.260
Sir?

18:14.400 --> 18:16.040
What aren't you telling me?

18:16.040 --> 18:18.600
Not a thing, sir.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.700
So, everything's cool
with you and Deakins?

18:20.710 --> 18:22.680
I'm hunky, she's dory.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.780
Shit.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.780
So, you're leaving me
without a C.P.D. detective

18:27.780 --> 18:29.580
because you couldn't keep
your dick in your pants?

18:29.580 --> 18:31.110
Never got to that point, sir.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.910
Hey, why...

19:06.920 --> 19:10.520
You be well. Take care. Bye. Be good.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.520
Okay, rookie's buying,
right? For everybody.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.860
Rookie's buying, everybody!

19:32.040 --> 19:33.600
No one is available to take your call.

19:33.610 --> 19:36.470
Please leave a message after the beep.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.010
Hey, Jack. It's... It's Harper.

19:39.020 --> 19:42.190
I'm... Yeah, I'm just...

19:42.190 --> 19:44.030
Oh, God, what am I doing?
Okay, I'm sorry. Bye.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.780
Talia's autopsy.

19:47.030 --> 19:48.430
Okay.

19:50.060 --> 19:52.120
Blunt force trauma.

19:52.130 --> 19:54.190
DNA from Marlon, that's not surprising.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.970
2 mystery DNA identities.

19:56.970 --> 19:59.540
Arguably, one could be
from the aunt, Ruth Freeman.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.340
Unh-unh. 2nd mystery DNA was found
under Talia Freeman's fingernails.

20:02.340 --> 20:04.140
That's probably from a fight.

20:04.140 --> 20:06.700
Looks like we're gonna need a
warrant for Marty Stein's DNA.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.870
Mmm-hmm. I already called
Assistant US Attorney Polley.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.580
She's on her way.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.020
How are you?

20:27.030 --> 20:28.470
Hold up.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.930
Do you have anything in your pockets?

20:32.940 --> 20:33.940
Yeah, there you go.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.100
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
Morning.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.850
- Thank you, Mr. Young.
- Thank you, sir.

20:48.590 --> 20:49.620
I'm in.

20:50.390 --> 20:51.960
Okay.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.260
Libby's office is in the east corridor.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.000
Office number 733.

21:21.990 --> 21:22.990
Shit.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.390
How the hell are you? It's been a while.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.480
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on. Amy Burton, Williams, & Mary?

22:08.870 --> 22:09.870
Fuck.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.280
Shelby Murphy was my best friend.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.180
You have to remember Shelby.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.650
You know, everybody remembers Shelby.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.820
Strawberry blond curls, killer rack?

22:21.820 --> 22:24.180
I really don't. I'm sorry, I have to go.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.180
Yeah.

22:35.990 --> 22:37.290
- Yeah?
- Declan's on his way in.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.810
Excuse me? What are
you doing in my office?

22:47.810 --> 22:49.610
- Ms. Hendricks?
- Yes?

22:51.010 --> 22:52.380
You're Libby Hendricks?

22:52.380 --> 22:54.010
Yes.

22:54.010 --> 22:56.310
I'm sorry, I was, uh,
expecting a much older woman.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.990
Nick Wells. I.T.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.720
You sent someone from
your office 2 weeks ago.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.660
The computer's running fine.

23:03.660 --> 23:05.920
I always put it in my briefcase.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.160
Uh, maybe I left it on my
desk. Declan Young. I'm on 5.

23:13.830 --> 23:15.990
Looks like you swiped in 20 minutes ago.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.630
I'm standing here, aren't I?

23:18.870 --> 23:20.430
Here, my license.

23:27.010 --> 23:29.370
Jack. Yeah, we've got
an unauthorized entry.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.740
7th floor.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.020
All right.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.320
Follow me, sir.

23:34.550 --> 23:35.550
Let's go.

23:39.790 --> 23:40.680
Actually, this is the office now.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.950
Will you excuse me one second?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.090
- Yeah.
- Declan is in the building.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.270
You know, that's what I figured.

23:46.270 --> 23:48.000
Mmm-hmm, yeah. Okay.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.480
Sorry, they, uh, forgot
to close the work order.

24:05.550 --> 24:06.550
Hi.

24:13.490 --> 24:14.490
Come on.

24:55.330 --> 24:56.330
Let's go.

25:00.210 --> 25:01.440
Thank you.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.180
Agent Lowry.

25:03.180 --> 25:06.450
Assistant U.S. Attorney Samantha
Polley, this is Agent Deakins.

25:06.450 --> 25:07.380
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, hi.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.620
Thanks for coming in.

25:08.620 --> 25:10.640
What's so important?

25:10.650 --> 25:12.490
Where is he? You're a loner and a leech,

25:12.490 --> 25:14.350
- and a fucking crook...
- Where is he?

25:14.350 --> 25:16.450
And you stick your fucking
nose in everybody's business,

25:16.460 --> 25:19.030
- and you destroy everything...
- We can stop this, you know that?

25:19.030 --> 25:21.450
- We can stop this right now.
- It's too fucking late.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.300
- He's probably in cuffs right now.
- Where is he?

25:23.300 --> 25:24.670
And you're about to join him. Where is he?

25:24.670 --> 25:26.120
- Fuck you!
- Where...

25:27.830 --> 25:29.330
Who was that?

25:29.330 --> 25:30.960
Marty Stein and Talia Freeman.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.540
Are you saying Marty
Stein killed Talia Freeman?

25:35.540 --> 25:37.130
Important enough for you, Counselor?

25:37.140 --> 25:39.700
Well, I knew he was an asshole, but this?

25:39.710 --> 25:44.010
The problem is, the warrant for the wire
wasn't for Marty. It was for Marlon Dinard.

25:44.020 --> 25:47.820
Why can't anything just be cut and dry?

25:47.820 --> 25:49.590
Look, the tape might exonerate Marlon,

25:49.590 --> 25:51.190
but it's in no way a slam
dunk against Marty Stein.

25:51.190 --> 25:53.560
Well, we may not need the audio.

25:53.560 --> 25:57.700
Talia Freeman's autopsy revealed
unidentified DNA under her fingernails.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.740
And you want a warrant to
take DNA from Marty Stein.

26:01.430 --> 26:03.060
Just so you know, if the tape gets tossed,

26:03.070 --> 26:04.340
the DNA might not be enough.

26:04.340 --> 26:05.770
But he did it.

26:05.770 --> 26:08.230
Since when does that matter in court?

26:08.240 --> 26:10.680
I'll make the call, but
it could go either way.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.280
Gonna have to let Marlon
Dinard's attorney know,

26:12.280 --> 26:13.600
we're dropping the murder charges.

26:13.910 --> 26:16.370
There's some irony, huh?

26:16.380 --> 26:19.680
"Hey, Marty, your client's off the
hook, but here's looking at you, kid."

26:19.690 --> 26:21.190
Can you do it without
telling him about the tape?

26:21.190 --> 26:23.620
I can.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.020
He won't like it, but I can.

26:26.290 --> 26:27.290
Agents.

26:29.530 --> 26:30.530
I like her.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.760
Mmm-hmm.

26:39.140 --> 26:43.180
Pulled every string I could, to get Judge
Kaymen to hear our motion to dismiss.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.480
Hmm.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.950
I can always count on you.

26:54.220 --> 26:57.120
Judge Kaymen's a lefty
with compassion for brains.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.660
You always got my back, Marty.

27:10.740 --> 27:12.040
What about the conspiracy charge?

27:14.270 --> 27:15.430
I got Jason Williams covered.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.040
That's really good to hear, Marty.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.320
Right, then.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.350
- Hang tight.
- Yeah.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.430
You can count on that, man.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.000
Has Senator Richmond called you yet?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.470
Yes. He's been very... What's the word?

28:14.470 --> 28:17.070
- Attentive.
- Ah, good. Excellent.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.040
Here's my question. Do you have anyone

28:19.040 --> 28:21.510
in the Metropolitan Correctional facility?

28:21.510 --> 28:23.410
Current tally, 36.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.580
Anyone you can trust?

28:26.580 --> 28:28.950
They're my blood, man. What do you need?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.360
You can close that.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.700
What do you want?

28:55.710 --> 28:59.550
Marty Stein's making a motion to dismiss
the conspiracy charges against Marlon.

28:59.550 --> 29:00.640
And the hearing's tomorrow.

29:01.710 --> 29:04.110
You think it could fly?

29:04.120 --> 29:07.040
You better hope not, 'cause then you're
of no use to us, and the deal's off.

29:08.550 --> 29:10.680
You know you could've just called, right?

29:10.690 --> 29:12.570
Yeah, I wanted to see
how they're treating you.

29:12.590 --> 29:13.920
All the comforts of home.

29:15.260 --> 29:16.260
Here.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.770
If it works out and you testify
like we agreed, it'll get better.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.040
All right.

29:39.990 --> 29:41.890
This is nice, right, Ma?

29:43.790 --> 29:44.890
Flowers.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.900
Patrick.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.990
Hey, Evelina.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.910
You got a sec?

29:58.640 --> 29:59.640
Sure.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.940
You guys raising the rates again?

30:06.950 --> 30:10.020
I'm afraid that's not it.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.860
Uh, we got a stop payment notice from
your mother's benefactor on Monday.

30:14.650 --> 30:15.850
That can't be right.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.490
Okay, uh, give me a couple of
days, I'll take care of this.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.000
Your mother's paid up 'til Friday.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.670
Look, we love Jackie, but if you can't
come up with a new method of payment,

30:31.670 --> 30:33.270
we'll have no choice.

30:33.270 --> 30:34.670
- We'll have to ask you to...
- What?

30:34.670 --> 30:37.170
You're gonna throw my
mother out on the street?

30:37.180 --> 30:39.450
I will take care of
this. Jackie stays put.

30:39.450 --> 30:41.840
Am I clear?

30:41.850 --> 30:44.520
I'll hold off billing as long as
I can. But no more than a week.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.780
Look, I'm really sorry.

30:55.790 --> 30:57.250
Oh, yes.

31:05.970 --> 31:06.970
What are you doing?

31:09.710 --> 31:12.040
I'm preparing for court.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.910
That? With the hands and the face?

31:14.910 --> 31:16.370
Betsy, what do you want?

31:17.680 --> 31:19.310
You have a visitor.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.490
Well, then why not say,
"You have a visitor,"

31:21.490 --> 31:24.820
and not narrate my day. Okay? Thank you.

31:24.820 --> 31:27.580
You have a visitor. I'll bring
you your lunch when you're done.

31:27.590 --> 31:29.450
With the visitor. That you have.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.060
Look who it is.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.600
Why would you cut off my mother?

31:41.610 --> 31:42.980
After all I've done for you?

31:44.380 --> 31:45.650
Not even a heads up?

31:48.350 --> 31:51.550
- I can't afford...
- I get it, okay? I get it.

31:51.550 --> 31:54.550
You wanna know why I get it?
Because I'd be just as upset,

31:54.550 --> 31:57.610
to find out that your task
force organized a sting,

31:57.620 --> 32:00.280
to bring down one of my
clients, and you did not tell me.

32:00.290 --> 32:01.790
I'm sorry, excuse me, what?

32:03.060 --> 32:04.590
I didn't know about the sting.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.400
That's great. You didn't know.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.070
You didn't know? Oh, okay. You're excused.

32:10.070 --> 32:11.770
He didn't know!

32:11.770 --> 32:14.570
I'm not on the task force
anymore! I'm back at C.P.D.

32:14.570 --> 32:16.800
Then what good are you to me?

32:16.810 --> 32:18.410
Look, I can still be a help, okay?

32:18.410 --> 32:20.480
I can still be your inside guy there.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.750
- Like you were such a great help before.
- Marty, please!

32:22.750 --> 32:23.880
It's my mother!

32:28.290 --> 32:30.120
Do I look like I care about your mother?

32:33.930 --> 32:35.360
That's your exit cue.

32:48.970 --> 32:50.030
Marty Stein.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.380
Thank you for calling.

33:03.460 --> 33:04.460
What is it?

33:08.930 --> 33:11.830
They dropped the charges.

33:11.830 --> 33:13.430
They dropped the murder charges on Marlon.

33:14.630 --> 33:16.030
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.930
No, that is not a good thing.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.680
Why did they drop the charges?

33:22.680 --> 33:24.500
What the fuck is going on here?

33:28.010 --> 33:29.270
What did Marlon tell them?

33:55.510 --> 33:56.510
All rise.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.220
The 7th Circuit Court
of Chicago is in session.

34:02.220 --> 34:03.740
Judge Seth Kaymen presiding.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.550
Good afternoon. Be seated, Counsel.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.639
You are Marlon Dinard?

34:24.570 --> 34:26.840
Yes, sir.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.440
Mr. Dinard, I'm holding a copy
of the charges against you,

34:29.440 --> 34:31.870
presenting that, "Marlon
Dinard did conspire,"

34:31.880 --> 34:34.510
"with known 13th Street
gang member Jason Williams,"

34:34.510 --> 34:35.909
"to kill Leo Taylor, a human being."

34:37.179 --> 34:38.940
Do you understand the charges against you?

34:38.949 --> 34:39.949
Yes, sir.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.820
Your Honor, I move to dismiss the
conspiracy charges against Mr. Dinard.

35:16.820 --> 35:20.720
I've read your briefs and, based on no
new information, motion is dismissed.

35:20.730 --> 35:22.830
Then I request bail, Your Honor.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.000
The State vigorously opposes.

35:30.570 --> 35:32.300
Just the two of you?

35:32.300 --> 35:34.730
Your Honor, the purpose
of bail does not include,

35:34.740 --> 35:37.640
unfairly punishing the
accused before the trial.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.200
We all know the purpose of bail.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.680
As per the Constitution, the
purpose of bail is to ensure,

35:48.690 --> 35:51.660
the defendant appears at trial while
posing no threat to the community.

35:54.860 --> 35:57.700
Marlon Dinard has pulled himself
out of poverty, off the street.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.700
No father, got himself an education.

36:03.670 --> 36:06.810
Made himself a successful businessman,
who gives back to the community,

36:06.810 --> 36:08.100
and also cares for his family.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.780
He is not a flight risk,

36:17.780 --> 36:21.850
because Mr. Dinard is solely responsible
for the welfare of his elderly aunt,

36:21.850 --> 36:24.180
Ms. Freeman, who also lives in the city.

36:24.190 --> 36:27.160
He has secured full-time employment,

36:27.160 --> 36:30.300
with one Ethan W. Kelly as a consultant,

36:30.300 --> 36:32.670
in order to assist his elderly aunt.

36:32.670 --> 36:34.160
You've got to be shitting me.

36:43.210 --> 36:45.310
Your Honor, permission to approach.

36:45.310 --> 36:46.610
Coming with, Your Honor.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.700
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.850
It appears that the prime witness
for the prosecution, Jason Williams,

37:01.860 --> 37:05.370
has been found dead in his cell, in
the Metropolitan Correctional facility.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.020
What?

37:07.030 --> 37:08.560
In light of these new circumstances,

37:08.570 --> 37:11.670
I will hear motions regarding
dismissals at a later date.

37:11.670 --> 37:13.540
This is bullshit.

37:13.540 --> 37:16.580
In the interim, I see no legal
reason to deny bail to Mr. Dinard.

37:17.210 --> 37:19.310
Set at $500,000.00.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.420
Court dismissed.

37:24.680 --> 37:25.700
You're free to go.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
Uh-huh.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.260
I know it was you, Marty.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.460
I know you killed my sister.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.750
Greg, listen to me. If you're holding
anything back from me, I swear...

37:56.750 --> 37:59.320
How many times can I say
the same thing to you, Ethan?

37:59.320 --> 38:01.320
- I believed her name was Libby Hendricks.
- Uh-huh.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.920
I believed it.

38:02.920 --> 38:03.920
Okay.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.890
- Well?
- Whoever she is, she's good.

38:09.890 --> 38:13.420
I mean, Greg's saying that he saw
I.D., credit cards, everything.

38:13.430 --> 38:15.960
What... All using the
name Libby Hendricks?

38:15.970 --> 38:17.500
- Yep.
- Well, if she's not Libby,

38:17.500 --> 38:18.780
let's find out who she really is.

38:20.740 --> 38:22.700
Let me try a reverse image
search on what we have.

38:24.340 --> 38:25.900
You want one?

38:25.910 --> 38:27.380
No, thanks. Not my style.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.920
Here we go. Got a hit.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.020
This is her, right?

38:39.020 --> 38:42.350
- Nofrillsgal19. Yeah, that's her.
- All right.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.080
Give me a moment. I'll get into her
account, see if I can find a name.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.330
Here she is.

38:53.340 --> 38:56.180
Libby Hendricks' real name is Mia Rochlan.

38:57.810 --> 38:59.680
Her real name, or the name
she's using on this site, Jen?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.610
Uh... Don't know.

39:01.610 --> 39:03.110
Whoever she is, on this site,

39:03.110 --> 39:05.610
- she's claiming to be Mia Rochlan.
- Yeah.

39:05.620 --> 39:08.690
She says she has a master's in
computer science from Caltech.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.160
Did her undergrad in the
Bay Area. No work history.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.560
California girl.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.460
She started something about 3
weeks ago with a guy named Neil83.

39:17.460 --> 39:21.520
Neil83 is Neil Stolper. Finance guy.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.060
Okay, that's our next
target. Where does he work?

39:24.070 --> 39:25.070
Mmm...

39:26.470 --> 39:29.970
Jackson Kale. Big firm. He's a V.P.

39:29.970 --> 39:32.040
Neil's a step up from Greg Barrett.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.960
Okay, give me the number
to Jackson Kale, please.

39:35.580 --> 39:36.580
It's right there.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.590
We're doing good, huh?

39:47.590 --> 39:49.120
Neil Stolper's office, please.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.030
Yeah, look, I know it's late,
but is Neil still in the office?

39:55.030 --> 39:56.030
Uh-huh.

39:56.670 --> 39:58.270
Oh?

39:58.270 --> 39:59.710
Well, do you know when he'll be back?

40:03.440 --> 40:06.140
Uh, no, no message, it's fine.
I'll... I'll call back. Thank you.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.350
He's been out sick. Where does he live?

40:11.850 --> 40:14.090
Here we go.

40:14.090 --> 40:18.060
Shit. He sold his house
on Aster about a month ago.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.360
According to his credit card
records, he's been staying in hotels.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.030
- Where?
- Don't know.

40:22.030 --> 40:23.560
He checked out of the Drake 2 days ago.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.960
He's probably paying cash somewhere.

40:28.030 --> 40:32.300
Okay, look. I need you to pose as
Mia and set up a meeting. Understand?

40:32.300 --> 40:33.730
You know, someplace that
they met in the past.

40:33.740 --> 40:35.180
Um...

40:37.040 --> 40:39.700
They hooked up at
Rosewater about 3 weeks ago.

40:39.710 --> 40:42.220
That'll do. Let me know when
he responds now, all right?

40:42.220 --> 40:44.770
- Yeah, on it, boss.
- Oh.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.440
And don't forget to put
me on the guest list.

40:46.450 --> 40:47.450
Thanks, Jen.

40:54.790 --> 40:57.250
Stolper messaged Mia that
he's upstairs at the club.

40:57.260 --> 40:58.620
- Has Mia replied yet?
- No.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.720
Okay, thanks.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.700
Can you keep it out front?
That's for you. Thanks.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.940
- Could I get a sparkling water with lime, please?
- You bet.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.540
Excuse me, miss?

42:15.470 --> 42:16.700
Can I ask you a question?

42:17.310 --> 42:19.010
What's upstairs?

42:19.010 --> 42:20.750
No hello?

42:20.750 --> 42:23.180
- I'm sorry. Grant.
- Ginger.

42:23.180 --> 42:26.480
Pleasure, Ginger. So, what's upstairs?

42:26.480 --> 42:29.550
- What are you looking for?
- Well, whatever's upstairs.

42:29.550 --> 42:32.050
- It's a craps game. You play?
- Oh, yeah?

42:32.060 --> 42:33.930
I do, I do. Can anyone play?

42:35.260 --> 42:36.860
- Depends.
- Oh, yeah?

42:36.860 --> 42:39.190
Are you anyone?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.940
Well, I mean, I'm pretty
good, I guess you could say.

42:41.940 --> 42:45.660
Good at what, throwing dice? It's random.

42:45.670 --> 42:48.940
Oh, there's nothing random
about money management.

42:48.940 --> 42:50.680
I'm sure you already
know that, right, Ginger?

42:50.680 --> 42:53.380
- That I definitely do.
- Mmm.

42:53.380 --> 42:55.350
I'll tell you what. You
help me get upstairs,

42:56.910 --> 43:00.040
and I'll bankroll you. I'll give you 25%.

43:00.050 --> 43:02.880
You know what? Make it 30% of
whatever we win. What do you say, hmm?

43:02.890 --> 43:04.120
We just met.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.680
Well, yeah.

43:06.690 --> 43:09.530
You know, sometimes I get a feeling
with people, and I got that with you.

43:10.730 --> 43:13.200
- You're good.
- Yeah?

43:13.200 --> 43:14.880
- Come on.
- I'm so sorry. Hold on one second.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.100
Go ahead.

43:18.300 --> 43:20.560
Jen, anything from Mia?

43:20.570 --> 43:22.430
No, nothing.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.440
Well, I'm going upstairs
to see Neil right now.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.270
Yeah. All right.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.120
- Hey, Mikey, he's with me.
- How are you, sir?

43:48.170 --> 43:50.240
- Everything you hoped for?
- You bet.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.160
There's my lucky charm!

43:52.170 --> 43:54.240
- Hey!
- Someone's happy to see you.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.670
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

43:55.670 --> 43:56.670
What took you so long?

43:57.440 --> 43:58.900
Grant.

43:58.910 --> 43:59.910
- Neil.
- Hey, Neil.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.980
1,2, 3, 4, 5.

44:05.980 --> 44:08.100
- Let's start with that.
- Chip change, $500.00.

44:09.990 --> 44:11.190
New shooter, new shooter!

44:13.920 --> 44:15.400
Let's see what you got, Ginger.

44:21.130 --> 44:22.930
7, winner!

44:27.940 --> 44:30.540
The 8, pull the 8. Hard 6.

44:30.540 --> 44:31.570
Hard 6.

44:33.640 --> 44:36.640
- 8!
- Yes!

44:36.650 --> 44:39.620
Jesus Christ, Neil. Where'd you
find this woman? She's sensational.

44:39.620 --> 44:41.720
Oh, there's no one like Ginger, baby.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.960
- So, what do you do?
- I'm in finance. You?

44:43.960 --> 44:45.280
Finance, huh?

44:45.290 --> 44:47.120
What?

44:47.120 --> 44:49.040
No, it's just funny. I
investigate guys like you.

44:49.790 --> 44:51.520
Oh, you do?

44:51.530 --> 44:53.470
Yeah, actually, I'm with the S.E.C.

44:55.370 --> 44:56.400
Come on.

44:57.470 --> 44:59.670
You know, in fact,

44:59.670 --> 45:01.110
you've been a hard guy to find, Neil.

45:03.340 --> 45:05.310
Stolper, right? That's your
last name, Neil Stolper?

45:05.310 --> 45:07.910
- Whoa, whoa...
- What?

45:07.910 --> 45:10.410
Who the fuck are you?
I didn't do anything.

45:10.410 --> 45:12.980
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you're not in trouble. Yet.

45:12.980 --> 45:14.820
But Mia Rochlan? Well,
that's a different story.

45:17.690 --> 45:19.730
She's been using your name
in illegal trades, Neil.

45:25.830 --> 45:27.000
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.630
Damn it, where the hell are you?

45:35.110 --> 45:36.810
Well, he knew my fucking
name, that's what.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.840
No, how fast can you get to my place?

45:40.850 --> 45:42.450
Okay, no, you... Now. You come now.

45:54.730 --> 45:56.530
- Excuse me, sir?
- You got the keys to the Caddy?

47:39.060 --> 47:40.590
- Hello?
- Greg, it's Ethan Kelly.

47:41.500 --> 47:42.500
I found her.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.300
