00:01.126 --> 00:02.752
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.129
I want you to meet my mother.

00:04.713 --> 00:05.880
I'd love to meet her.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.257
You know who you're looking at right now?

00:07.340 --> 00:09.676
Yeah, I'm looking at a man
who's about to get dishonorably discharged

00:09.759 --> 00:14.097
from his own family
if he doesn't ease...up.

What a beautiful start to my day.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.107
Why, thank you, son.
I love this dress too.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.275
So, some happy housekeeping

02:30.358 --> 02:31.818
-before you make your rounds.
-Okay.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.654
I'm on a plane to L. A.
on Friday to finalize everything

02:34.737 --> 02:36.614
with the medical board for your new lab.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.241
I see someone's
flying business class.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.742
First class. I'm using miles.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.827
Whose miles?

02:40.910 --> 02:42.078
Family miles.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.497
Mitchie's lost a contact lens.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.915
Both lenses, actually.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.709
- Are those helping?
- No. No, they're not.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.461
And you're right, Ms. D,
that dress you're wearing is a revelation.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.297
He's trying to go with me to L. A.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.882
I will fly with the animals in cargo.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.633
-You're staying here.
-I am!

02:55.717 --> 02:58.511
And in case you were wondering,
yes, you are paying them to canoodle.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.138
We're... We're not canoodling.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.306
No, we're petting.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.975
So is this what goes on in the lab
when there's not a body on the table?

03:04.058 --> 03:05.476
-Not everyday.
-Always.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.561
- Yes.
- No!

03:06.644 --> 03:09.189
Bro, come on.
We're just happy to be here, you know?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.940
With you. To see your business,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.110
which helps so many families,
expand to another city?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.612
Hello? That's kind of huge.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.489
But we're also celebrating you.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.743
Seeing you back like this, uh,

03:21.826 --> 03:22.827
healthy and strong,

03:23.828 --> 03:24.829
it's everything.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.914
No, no, no, no, no.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.415
There's gonna be no crying today,

03:27.498 --> 03:29.459
because today is a day of celebration.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.587
So, I see some non-alcoholic
carbonated cider

03:32.670 --> 03:34.505
that needs to get drunk!
So let's drink it.

03:34.839 --> 03:35.840
Hey, Mitchie.

03:35.924 --> 03:36.966
Oh, yeah.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.052
Oh, don't act like you weren't
ready to come over here.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.386
- Come on, now.
- I was.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.638
Get the cider out.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.312
Oh! Someone just got shot in the face!

03:49.395 --> 03:50.647
Why you gotta do me like that?

03:50.730 --> 03:53.566
Well, pop your head up like a punk
and you're gonna get clipped, Vinny.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.401
-She always bust balls like this?
-What's up?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.862
Nothing. You know, just came
by to see my baby brother.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.614
Maybe grab some eggs.

04:00.031 --> 04:00.907
I'm starving.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.867
Yo, big sis gonna cook it up?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.537
What, you want me to cook it up?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.874
Over-easy, bacon, coffee, black.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.048
Look, Leese, I lost my temper with Rosie,

04:17.131 --> 04:18.299
but if you came by to lecture me I don't--

04:18.383 --> 04:20.969
I came by because I get it.

04:21.928 --> 04:22.929
You know why?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.764
I've been lost before.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.933
Just like you.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.770
I've wanted to hate everyone
and everything around me,

04:30.853 --> 04:31.854
just like you.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.692
I've picked unnecessary fights before,
just like you.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.403
But I know your heart.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.863
And I know how selfless you are.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.699
The only way to get through this,

04:43.199 --> 04:45.201
is to protect you.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.953
Nobody else right now.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.788
Not me, not Ma, nobody.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.415
Just you.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.334
Okay, bro?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.254
Thank you, sis.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.548
I love you.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.719
But I gotta protect you
from one last thing, okay?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.681
Yo, Vinny can't cook.
Don't eat his eggs, okay?

05:06.764 --> 05:08.391
I can hear you, dick.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.520
Rosie?

05:12.603 --> 05:14.480
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.402
And at some point... you should too.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.211
How does he
beat us here like this always?

05:37.295 --> 05:39.255
I don't know, but I'm used to it.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.799
Oh, I haven't seen
that look on the Rosie mug in a while.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.344
A guy passes away,
let's say, four or five days ago.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.678
Goes through the works.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.305
Family puts him in his favorite suit,

05:47.388 --> 05:48.431
arrangements made.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.351
How about you give us the straight version
that's understood by normal people?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.479
This deceased man has already been
embalmed and prepped for burial.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
-Wait, what?
-That's right, a funeral.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.983
Which I'm guessing
was scheduled for today.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.737
Wait. A case came in this morning
with Feldheim. North Shore Mortuary.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.988
Didn't a body go missing?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.907
-Yeah. Desouza.
-Hmm?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.367
Get me a pic on that missing body.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.369
Need it ten minutes ago.
See if we got a match.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.663
Who the hell steals a body
and throws it on the street?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.290
I don't know. I'm just a pathologist.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.626
But I know that look on that Villa mug.
What do you got?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.586
Whoever did this
wanted to divert attention.

06:18.669 --> 06:19.670
Or draw attention.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.964
Exactly. We gotta get
these people off the street, now.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.092
Okay, all right. Move, people!

06:24.175 --> 06:25.510
Let's get these guys out of here.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.844
You heard her. Let's go!

06:26.928 --> 06:29.347
Come on! Back it up!
Let's go! Come on!

06:51.619 --> 06:54.622
Barbara Dicasoli,
coming to you from downtown Miami,

06:54.705 --> 06:56.916
where a local businessman
is lucky to be alive today

06:56.999 --> 07:00.002
after an armed robbery
at Luxe Jewelery Collection.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.671
Bastion Bleiweiss was alone

07:01.754 --> 07:03.631
when five masked
gunmen entered his store...

07:03.714 --> 07:05.007
So let me get this straight.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.009
Our crew dumped a dead body in the street

07:07.093 --> 07:08.678
to distract everyone from a robber?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.263
Told you it was a weird one.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.056
So, our burglars moonlight as killers now?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
No, the body was already dead.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.226
Yeah, they stole it from a mortuary.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.354
They wanted to make sure all eyes
were on it, instead of on this.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.024
This is Bastion Bleiweiss,
owner of the store.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.360
He was the only one inside
when the robbery took place.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.237
Hey, Bastion, I'm Captain Slade.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.407
Be pretty helpful if you can tell us
anything you remember about the robbery.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.118
These guys knew my store
like the back of both hands.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.495
They got what they came for
in two minutes flat.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.831
I couldn't see their faces.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.749
Or their bodies.
They were covered in Kevlar

07:38.833 --> 07:41.419
and one of them wanted blood.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.796
He wanted to hear my last words.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.508
He kept telling me I was gonna die.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.011
And a second later
the son of bitch, just bam!

07:50.094 --> 07:52.180
- You have six other stores, right?
- Yeah.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.140
Any of them been hit
in the last year or so?

07:54.223 --> 07:55.725
I've had attempted robberies before,

07:55.808 --> 07:57.351
one of them successful.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.687
I have millions
of dollars of merchandise,

07:59.770 --> 08:01.772
so, until they're caught, I'm...

08:01.856 --> 08:03.691
I'm just gonna consolidate everything.

08:03.774 --> 08:07.236
All right. Look, if we have any more
questions, we'll give you a call.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.321
Thank you.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.407
Seems like there's a psychopath
in the crew

08:11.491 --> 08:13.659
that takes great pleasure
in terrorizing his victims.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.828
Agreed. Which is why
I want these guys caught

08:15.912 --> 08:17.663
before they pull off their next score.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.670
Uh. Hey, I thought you were
gonna take some time off.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.465
Yeah, staff is backed up.
They need me here.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.884
No, you need to take care of yourself.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.636
Everything okay?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.971
My mom passed away last night.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.264
Cardiac arrest.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.807
Oh, Adrian, I'm so sorry.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.017
Thanks, Rosie.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.269
But right now I'm gonna do
a full external examination

08:40.353 --> 08:42.480
to determine if the thieves
left any evidence behind.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.483
No, no. You haven't slept in two days.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.527
And you just lost your best friend.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.530
Listen, Magic City will take care
of this one, at no cost.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.866
Thank you.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.992
We got you.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.871
One more signature here and we are good.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.206
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.124
-Later, Rosie.
-Thanks, Kentucky.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.044
This is Ned Winter, 55 years of age.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.255
Died last week of natural causes.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.091
The crew of thieves who robbed
the jewelry store also stole this body

09:10.174 --> 09:11.384
from the North Shore Mortuary.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.261
-Which means-
-The bad guys handled the body.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.595
Point for Mitchie.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.014
TMI, can you scan
the screens on the hands and the shoes?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.808
See if they left any trace DNA behind?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.143
T?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.728
Hmm. I'm...what?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.314
Dear, are you all right?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.024
She's good. She's fine.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.776
We're great.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.902
Are we now?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.904
I can diagnose this one from experience.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.614
'Cause this guy has fallen back

09:33.698 --> 09:35.616
into the arms of an ex-lover or two.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.118
Actually, just one.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.620
But the re-ignition
of the physical flames,

09:39.704 --> 09:41.706
-lomo caliente, which translates-
-Hot loins.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.958
- Yeah.
- No, which we do not have.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.002
It's probably just an argument.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.086
It happens.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.255
If either of you wants
to talk, I'm... I'm here.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.048
No. No talking.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.384
But clock is ticking on this case.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.927
Right, Rosie?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.470
Yes, yes. The clock is ticking.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.597
Let's get started.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.519

10:24.832 --> 10:27.251
TMI, how confident
are you about pulling DNA

10:27.335 --> 10:28.794
from dandruff on a scale of one to-

10:28.878 --> 10:30.254
Ten. Yeah, I'm on it.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.007
But if dead skin cells
from Ned's scalp ended up on his suit,

10:33.090 --> 10:35.259
how does...

10:35.343 --> 10:36.469
Oh. You looked at his scalp

10:36.552 --> 10:38.429
-and found no signs of dandruff.
-Zero.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.056
Yeah, but the dandruff could have come

10:40.139 --> 10:42.183
from anyone at the mortuary,
the crime scene or--

10:42.266 --> 10:43.768
One of our thieves. So...

10:43.851 --> 10:45.061
-Run it.
-Run it.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.187
Run it.

10:46.270 --> 10:50.316
Um... Um, maybe, we should call security.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.525
Oh, I am security.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.944
Rose-man, if you need
an extra set of fisticuffs, I'm in.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.738
Just know that I have never thrown a punch

10:55.821 --> 10:57.365
and I don't know how to make fists.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.367
Mitchie, I'm good. Thank you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.541
Uh...

11:08.876 --> 11:11.671
I've got no excuse for what I did.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.047
All right?

11:13.547 --> 11:16.509
Turns out I'm only good
at one thing, Rosie.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.302
Protecting.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.889
I feel like I'm just looking around
and trying to find my way, you know?

11:23.474 --> 11:25.434
Prime example, right here.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.062
I used to hand out candy
to the kids in Mosul.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.523
You know, get 'em away
from my post, away from any danger,

11:30.606 --> 11:31.899
in case it went down.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.192
And this one little Iraqi boy,

11:33.275 --> 11:35.194
he gave me this and he said...

11:37.488 --> 11:38.739
"Good luck, good luck."

11:40.199 --> 11:43.244
And he turns and goes
back to the market place

11:43.327 --> 11:45.329
and gets clipped by an IED.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.748
Boom. Just like that.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.125
And maybe in some weird way

11:49.208 --> 11:51.252
I was trying to recreate
that over here and I've...

11:51.335 --> 11:52.336
Which I know is crazy,

11:52.420 --> 11:55.047
which I don't expect you
to understand or anything like that but--

11:55.131 --> 11:57.591
You know what?
You're right. I don't understand.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.553
I do understand what
it's like to have a lot of pride.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.596
And I know how hard it is to ask for help.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.475
Listen, Marcos, I think
the world of your sister.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.311
So the thought of hurting her,
it's just...

12:09.395 --> 12:10.980
just not gonna happen.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.441
And I think that's something
you can understand.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.775
And I hope you do.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.029
So, if you're good, I'm good.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.742
Hey!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.368
We got a hit on the dandruff.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.333
I love me some DNA!

12:31.792 --> 12:34.003
-Nice work, Rosie.
-Oh, can you stay that again, please?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.796
Suspect's name is Benji Tovar.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.256
Served six years for armed robbery.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.133
Yeah, he got out
last year on good behavior.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.761
Look, I'd love for you
to lock your loafers right here,

12:41.844 --> 12:43.763
so you don't get shot in your pretty face.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.765
-You calling me pretty?
-Stay.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.308
Don't let it get to your head.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.450
Remember this?

13:04.533 --> 13:05.576
Oh, yeah.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.787
This gunshot wound was at close range.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.623
Large caliber.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.417
Clean entry. Clean exit.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.004
Well, I think I found...
it's new home.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.589
Looks like a 5.56.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.341
Maybe from an M4 carbine?

13:20.716 --> 13:23.385
Good chance Benji was murdered
by a member of his own crew.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.554
Sounds like these guys
are gonna go to war with each other.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
We better track them down
before things get worse.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.517
And before they all leave the country.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.684
What are you talking about?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.978
I noticed multiple sores
inside Benji's mouth.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.690
That paired with the three different
injection points on his left arm,

13:36.774 --> 13:38.776
tells me he got
inoculation shots recently.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.903
And that tells me he's going
somewhere far, far away

13:40.986 --> 13:41.987
and he's going soon.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.156
If these guys are pulling
one last big score,

13:44.240 --> 13:45.908
it must also be very soon.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.743
Rosie, get Benji to your lab now.

13:47.827 --> 13:53.207
What's going on? What's going on?
I live here. Is Benji okay? I live here.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
He's okay, right? He's okay?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.460
You don't wanna go in there, okay?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.257
He finally got on a good path.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.926
Ever since he got out of prison,
he changed.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.762
We were gonna get married.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.974
Myra, you have to know that Benji was
working with some very dangerous thieves

14:10.057 --> 14:12.142
who robbed a
high-end jewelry store yesterday.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.311
But he was working construction.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.646
I know it. Trust me.

14:15.729 --> 14:16.939
Paychecks?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.149
You seen one recently?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.027
Look, it is critical that we stop

14:22.111 --> 14:25.239
whoever Benji was working with
before they pull their next job.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.701
Where he was going the past several weeks
might lead us to them.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.619
Just hang tight till we're done in there.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.587
Las Obras Cafe. Your favorite.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.339
Actually, Puerto Sagua is my favorite.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.884
Yeah, I know but the line
was hella long, so...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.303
We'll do Puerto Sagua another time?

14:47.386 --> 14:50.097
Hey, whatever you want, say the word.
I'll be there, I promise, okay?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.557
What are you doing here?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.350
Last stop on my apology tour.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.019
Your captain, I figured he'd be here.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.353
It's funny though, you know?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.565
I had to lose my head in order
to start seeing clearly again.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.026
But I'll be all right.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.193
I know you are.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.654
I did get my swag, like,
all the way back too.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.281
You know, so Miami better watch out

15:07.364 --> 15:09.700
'cause your baby brother,
has got a hot date tonight.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.703
What's up?

15:12.786 --> 15:14.663
-You all right?
-Yeah.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.917
If it's Rosie, if he's still pissed at me,
I could go talk to him or something.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.752
No. No, no, no. It's Adrian.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.962
I asked him to take some time off

15:22.046 --> 15:24.632
and I just found out he quit
the M.E.'s office today.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.843
He seems lost.
I don't know how to help him.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.762
Yeah, you do.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.473
He just needs to know
you're not going anywhere.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.894
Yo, ain't it against the rules
to eat the evidence?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.313
Mmm. Chambray Chocolates.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.315
Way over in Aventura.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.902
Myra said it was a gift
from their anniversary, so.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.279
Wait.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.241
Benji bought lottery tickets
from a gas station in the same area.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.620
Yeah. So the dude bought
his lady some chocolates

15:54.703 --> 15:56.121
and stopped to get gas on the way.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.874
But he bought the gas
and the chocolates on different days,

15:58.958 --> 16:02.670
which means he was going
to this area of town regularly.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.799
Pipp, where are we with the tox?

16:06.882 --> 16:09.885
Preliminary results
are in and you were right.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.762
Presence of doxycycline
and chloroquine means

16:11.845 --> 16:13.889
he got a series of shots
in the past 72 hours.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.434
I want a list of local doctors
who administer inoculations ASAP.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.519
Oh, do you need a hand?

16:18.602 --> 16:19.979
No, negative. Stay here, work.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.272
Deep thoughts
by Mitchie Mendelson. What do you got?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.775
Foreign particles adhered
to the esophagus, lining the lungs.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.859
- Theory?
- Brewing.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.529
We got any sodium rhodizonate?
Yeah, we do!

16:28.612 --> 16:30.864
TMI, you mind running upstairs
and getting some sod-rhod?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.075
- No, I got it.
- No, no. She can get it.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.576
You and I need to talk.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.496
The last time I heard those words
my ex-wife was telling me

16:37.579 --> 16:39.248
that she was excited about the potential

16:39.331 --> 16:41.333
of falling in love
with someone who wasn't me.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.418
Well, this will be a very

16:42.501 --> 16:44.128
-different conversation than that.
-I would hope so.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.797
I am going to Los Angeles on Friday.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.881
Great. No worries.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.008
To interview pathologists.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.092
Great! What?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.803
Listen Mitchie, I've been
doing this a long time,

16:52.886 --> 16:55.347
and to have someone
on the flank with your passion,

16:55.431 --> 16:58.934
your talent, and your character
is extremely valuable to me.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.353
And like Basquiat and Warhol,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.856
you and I, we make each other
even better at what we do.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.859
So selfishly, I need you here
working with me.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.490
Damn, Rosie. You got me
right in the heart space.

17:15.826 --> 17:16.994
Thanks for that.

17:18.954 --> 17:19.955
Here.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.124
All right.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.334
Just a drop. Boop!

17:24.418 --> 17:26.712
Oh! Okay, I'm interested.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.921
Basquiat, check this out.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.175
So we got evidence of lead in the throat,
which means wherever Benji was working,

17:31.258 --> 17:34.094
he was inhaling materials
that haven't been used in over 40 years.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.929
-Nice work, partner.
-Thank you.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.600
Isn't that like a needle in a haystack
the size of, I don't know, Miami?

17:39.683 --> 17:41.435
No. Not necessarily.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.654
Hey, can we add my dots
to your dots so we can...

17:52.738 --> 17:54.782
say it with me, play connect the dots?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.576
Rosie, I've been up all night
listening to Desouza snore.

17:57.659 --> 17:58.994
Oh, that's adorable.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
But check this out. Three doctors in Miami

18:01.038 --> 18:03.040
give inoculation shots
to travel to Africa.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.877
Benji got his from Dr. Picard on Alvarado.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.963
Sweet, so you want a celebratory hug?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.216
Now that we only have
ten square miles to search?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.592
Well, hold that embrace.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.178
Mitchie also found
traces of lead-based paint

18:16.261 --> 18:18.263
and a type of fiberglass in Benji's lungs.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.057
That stuff hasn't
been used since the '70s.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.017
So these guys have been hiding

18:22.101 --> 18:24.686
in an old building that hasn't
been touched in decades.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.771
Yeah, like decades.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.524
Like, before you were born decades.
Wait, when were you born again?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.025
Bingram Park Mall.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.944
Abandoned. Never reopened.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.863
I think we have a winner.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.616
And, a celebratory hug.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.785
Come on! Celebratory.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.286
Gotta do it.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.719
Celebratory hug.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.263
Yeah.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.890
I've always loved those.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.268
Me too.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.988
Yeah, maybe we should hit the mall.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.614
Yeah. Let's, uh...

19:20.033 --> 19:21.368
Let's hit the mall.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.820
Look familiar, no?

19:56.904 --> 19:59.072
Yeah, looks like a replica
of Luxe Jewelry.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.324
This is where they rehearsed.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.825
Yeah, these guys are good.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.410
Security system is high end.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.205
Two cameras, two keypads,

20:06.288 --> 20:08.290
probably the same that are in the store.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.168
Same model safe.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.047
This is still warm.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.590
Somebody was just here.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.133
Okay, let's get our cars around back

20:18.217 --> 20:20.135
and wait for our friend
to return. Stay close.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.893
Rosie, Rosie, scooch back.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.019
I'm not gonna scooch back.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.188
"Stay close, Rosie."
Those were your words, not mine.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.522
I said close, not nuzzle.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.483
-This is not a nuzzle.
-Feels like one.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.318
Well, then you've never
been properly nuzzled.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.904
Okay, muzzle.
Muzzle, is what I need you to do.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.704
We're being watched.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.421
-Yeah, Boss?
-We're blown.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.761
Stop the vehicle!

21:14.147 --> 21:15.232
Hands up!

21:15.315 --> 21:17.401
Open your hands
and walk towards me!

21:17.484 --> 21:19.319
Get down on the ground now!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.714
I don't know. Look.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.758
I met Benji at a construction site
five months ago.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.011
He offered me a grand a day
to build this thing.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.305
And yeah, it was weird
and I should've asked questions,

21:46.388 --> 21:47.973
but I needed the dough.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.058
Open up your mouth, please, Wayne.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.728
He's a pathologist, checking body stuff.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.021
Open up your mouth.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.774
I see no signs of inoculation shots.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.151
Give me a minute with him.

22:03.905 --> 22:04.948
You got kids, yeah?

22:05.032 --> 22:06.074
Yeah.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.994
Okay, you see,
people who don't have children

22:09.077 --> 22:12.414
Don't understand the heartbreak
that a parent feels when one of their kids

22:12.497 --> 22:14.624
is hurt by something that you did.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.126
Am I right?

22:16.209 --> 22:17.461
Now, I have seven kids.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.463
Listen to me, Wayne.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.965
If you don't give me
what we need to find this guy,

22:22.424 --> 22:24.343
I'm gonna pull your kids out of class

22:24.426 --> 22:27.512
and tell them that Dad is not gonna
be home for a very long time.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.181
And that look that we fear,

22:29.264 --> 22:31.600
that's the look that you're
gonna be seeing through bars

22:31.683 --> 22:33.352
for the next ten years.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.273
The guy that calls all the
shots goes by the name Slim.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.067
I've only seen him once.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.194
And it was dark, so...

22:47.324 --> 22:49.451
Cap, ran Slim through the system.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.620
Uh... It's a long list.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.288
Gonna take a few hours to whittle down.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.623
All right. Let me know when.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.333
-Daddy!
-There's my little monster!

22:56.416 --> 22:58.251
- What's up, buddy?
- Thanks for watching him.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.253
Emergency in my office.
Shouldn't take but an hour.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.797
All right. Yeah.
I got time. We're good.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.923
Everything is in here.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.008
Hey Cap, this is Martha. My ex-wife.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.635
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.762
-You be good for your dad, okay?
-Okay.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.430
You wanna go to your
favorite burger joint?

23:10.514 --> 23:11.681
-Yes!
-Yeah?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.809
-Yeah.
-Hey Cap, you wanna join us?

23:13.892 --> 23:14.893
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.561
You guys go ahead. I'll be fine.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.563
Come on! Gentlemen only. I insist.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.651
Please come with us, Uncle Slade.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.822
All right. Fine.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.281
There you go. Burgers!

23:28.365 --> 23:29.574
-Burgers!
-Burgers!

23:29.658 --> 23:31.326
You let your dad eat burgers?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.869
Fatten you up. Come on.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.710
Adrian. Hey. Uh... I didn't...

23:40.794 --> 23:42.212
Yeah, I know. You got a minute?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.672
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.301
I want that job in Angel City.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.388
-I'm sorry, what?
-Hear me out.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.889
I love my job.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.350
What we do,
means everything to me.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.727
And right now, I feel like
I'm at the top of my game.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.062
And honestly?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.440
A lot of that has to do with you, Rosie.

24:01.523 --> 24:06.361
You know, watching the best,
it has pushed me, focused me, inspired me.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.904
Thank you for that, but uh...

24:07.988 --> 24:09.865
I can't stay here anymore, Rosie.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.076
I...

24:14.995 --> 24:15.996
I got lucky.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.999
I had the best mom and dad in the world,

24:19.082 --> 24:22.294
but everything in Miami
reminds me of them.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.962
I need a change.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.547
I want this opportunity.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.174
I'm ready to fight for this job,

24:27.257 --> 24:30.760
and you have my word,
there is zero chance I'll let you down.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.180
What about Villa?

24:33.263 --> 24:35.098
I know we're strong enough
to make it work.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.809
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.104
Do me a favor. Maybe keep this
between us until I talk to her.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.606
Hey, Villa.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.567
Yep, I'm on my way.

24:46.651 --> 24:50.155
All right, so, uh, listen.
Let me... Let me think about this.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.533
Of course. I respect
whatever decision you make.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.037
So, what you got, Villa?

24:57.120 --> 24:58.663
The jewelry store that got robbed

24:58.747 --> 25:00.790
didn't have jewelry cases
in the middle of the room.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.667
But the replica they built at the mall...

25:02.751 --> 25:04.252
Look, cases.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.213
Well, maybe they made a mistake.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.632
These robbers don't make mistakes.

25:08.715 --> 25:12.010
And the security system at Luxe
is different than the one at the replica.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.554
Same brand, but the system
they put into the replica

25:14.638 --> 25:16.181
is much more sophisticated.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.892
Well, why would they practice
using a different security system?

25:19.434 --> 25:22.479
Because the model they built at the mall
isn't the store they already robbed.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.147
It's the next place they're gonna hit.

25:24.231 --> 25:27.025
Wait, you remember Bastion said that
he's gonna consolidate all of his

25:27.108 --> 25:28.818
merchandise until the robbers were caught?

25:28.902 --> 25:29.903
Yeah, he did. Why?

25:29.986 --> 25:31.696
Bastion has six stores in Miami.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.740
Where are all those
diamonds going? One location?

25:33.823 --> 25:35.575
Yeah, that would be a pretty big score.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.910
That would be a huge score.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.621
I think we need to find out where
Bastion moved all those rocks.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.795
Villa, you all right?

25:49.756 --> 25:51.216
Yeah, I'm good.

25:57.847 --> 25:58.974
What's up, Leese?

25:59.057 --> 26:02.644
Hey! You know, I just found myself

26:02.727 --> 26:04.229
with another hour to kill.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.065
Guess what? I'm looking
at Puerto Sagua right now

26:07.148 --> 26:09.025
and there is no line.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.611
Come on, baby bro. Let's do this.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.114
Uh... No, I, I can't right now.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.782
Come on!

26:16.366 --> 26:17.659
Marcos, you promised.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.329
No, no. I know but I'm
in something I can't get out of.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.747
Another time, yeah?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.791
Why? What's up? Where you at?

26:26.251 --> 26:27.335
Golden Beach.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.753
Wow. Okay.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.424
I never heard the seagulls
so quiet this time of year.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.804
Marcos, I really need
you to meet me. Please.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.848
For me.

26:42.225 --> 26:45.061
Yeah, I can't. I'm sorry, uh.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.689
Bye, sis.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.748
Okay. Let's see here.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.791
Recognize this place at all?

27:07.375 --> 27:10.879
Yeah. Looks like they're trying
to build a replica of one of my stores.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.464
Maybe the one they already broke into.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.216
I don't know. See, this has a
display case in the center of the room

27:15.300 --> 27:17.469
and a very expensive
Bi-Tech security system.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.096
You said you were moving all your
merchandise after the robbery?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.264
Where was it going?

27:21.348 --> 27:22.932
To the vault of my flagship store.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.726
The one with the
expensive security system?

27:24.809 --> 27:27.395
Yes, but trust me,
they are not getting in there.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.481
Hey, Cap. I think we found our Slim.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.233
- Archie Craig.
- Oh, my God.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.694
Archie used to work security for me.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.656
Let me guess, at the flagship store
where you moved all your diamonds.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.908
This is going down today.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.910
-How do you know that?
-Gut feeling.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.454
Let's do this.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.935
Step out of the vehicle now!

28:11.398 --> 28:12.524
It's over!

28:42.303 --> 28:43.763
Come on! Hurry!

28:46.015 --> 28:47.934
This is the
East Miami P.D.!

28:48.017 --> 28:49.394
You are surrounded!

28:49.477 --> 28:51.312
Drop your weapons
and exit the vehicle.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.017
Aah!

29:47.535 --> 29:48.953
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

29:54.542 --> 29:55.794
Aah!

29:55.877 --> 29:56.961
You all right?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.046
Yeah.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.549
Let's move this. Go!

30:18.274 --> 30:19.275
Get back!

30:28.034 --> 30:29.160
-I'm okay!
-Are you sure?

30:29.244 --> 30:30.245
Yeah.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.840
Desouza!

30:47.470 --> 30:49.180
Desouza, look at me.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.058
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.768
I'm here now.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.395
You're gonna make this, okay?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.855
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

30:56.938 --> 30:58.064
All right.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.204
I love you.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.998
I love you too.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.299
Drop it!

31:25.425 --> 31:27.051
Don't make me do this.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.697
Rosie, get the hell out of here.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.909
Hey, P-Jacks! P-Jacks!

31:53.828 --> 31:54.913
Are you good? You good?

31:54.996 --> 31:58.291
Listen, the bullet hit her artery. I need
you to put constant pressure right here.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.960
-Yeah, Rosie, I can do it.
-Constant pressure right there, okay?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.724
-I told you to stay in the car!
-Thought you could use some help.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.352
-What are you, crazy?
-Time to take this son of a bitch down.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.325
All right. I'm gonna try
to get to the other side

32:32.408 --> 32:34.535
-and get a clear shot.
-No! You're not going anywhere

32:34.619 --> 32:36.371
-that's gonna get you killed.
-Somebody's gotta shoot

32:36.454 --> 32:37.830
this son of a bitch and it probably

32:37.914 --> 32:40.124
-shouldn't be a pathologist.
-My hand is okay, just cover me!

32:40.208 --> 32:42.627
No, Ira, listen to me!
You got too many things to go home to.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.630
Let Uncle Slade take care of this one.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.847
Cover me, ready? Let's go!

33:40.935 --> 33:43.521
No, I have a baby in the car! No!

34:25.730 --> 34:26.814
Slim.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.149
Check the baby!

34:29.609 --> 34:30.610
Baby's okay.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.159
Is Benji okay?

34:38.242 --> 34:39.577
We were gonna get married.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.912
Anybody remember this broad?

34:40.995 --> 34:43.706
And there's another one back there.
His name is Vincent, Marcos's roommate.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.416
And we got one member
of the crew still missing.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.127
-I think we know who that is.
-We gotta find Villa.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.798
Sorry, Leese.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.098
You're sorry?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.351
Really, Marcos, is that what
you wanna say to me right now?

35:03.434 --> 35:05.061
Nothing else to say.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.231
How could you?

35:08.314 --> 35:10.024
After everything we've been through.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.943
What we been through, sis?

35:12.026 --> 35:13.236
I gave the last eight years to

35:13.319 --> 35:15.613
this country and they
threw me away like trash.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.074
This is my ticket to early retirement.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.408
I earned this.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.954
You're a worse liar than me.
This isn't about money.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.705
This is about an addiction.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.958
That gun in your hand,
that adrenaline you feel

35:27.041 --> 35:29.001
when it's life or death,
that's what this is.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.711
It wasn't supposed to get this far.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.256
I had safety measures
put in place, but Slim?

35:33.339 --> 35:34.882
He's out of his damn mind!

35:35.967 --> 35:37.385
I couldn't control him anymore.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.011
This was supposed to be our last job

35:39.095 --> 35:40.179
and then I was out.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.889
You should've never been in.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.266
Yeah, you right, sis.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.350
You were always right!

35:45.560 --> 35:48.229
But shots are fired now, you can't
put the bullets back in the gun.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.690
No, but you're gonna put
your gun down right now!

35:51.524 --> 35:52.942
And do what?

35:53.025 --> 35:54.235
You arrest me?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.195
Live in a cage?

35:57.238 --> 36:00.158
How long do you think
a guy like me lasts in 6x6 cell

36:00.241 --> 36:03.077
till I start getting creative
with my bed sheets, huh?

36:03.578 --> 36:05.329
We can figure this out, okay? Me and you.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.540
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:07.623 --> 36:08.958
Only two ways this ends.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.668
You put me down or you let me go.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.503
No. Drop the weapon. Please!

36:12.879 --> 36:13.963
Drop it!

36:14.046 --> 36:15.506
Can't do it, Leese.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.674
I'm sorry.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.053
It's all you, your call.

36:29.103 --> 36:32.231
Take I-95 south
and jump off the first exit.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.900
Brickell Avenue.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.651
It's a construction zone.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.653
EMPD won't have it locked off.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.530
That's your out.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.908
But you leave the bag and the weapon.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.993
That's the deal. It is not negotiable.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.725
This is Detective Villa.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.519
All units lock off I-95 at Brickell.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.855
Suspect is unarmed and on foot.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.151
His name is Marcos Villa.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.292
Yes, I let him go.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.256
I wasn't going to shoot my brother.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.635
I called it in.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.387
He knew it was a trap.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.474
He got away.

38:10.454 --> 38:13.249
Sorry that we've
been acting weird lately,

38:13.332 --> 38:15.543
but we could not agree
on when to tell you.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.671
Or how to tell you.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.383
And we promise to throw a party

38:22.466 --> 38:24.552
and laugh and dance and cry but...

38:28.806 --> 38:31.017
We got married. We got married.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.601
We got married.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.510
Hey.

39:47.593 --> 39:48.844
Hey.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.222
Just saw Desouza
at the hospital. She's gonna be okay.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.060
So, this is your favorite spot, huh?

39:56.852 --> 39:59.605
I've been coming here since I was 15.

40:00.356 --> 40:03.109
Okay, but I mean,
of all the beaches in Miami--

40:03.192 --> 40:05.778
It's not about the beach, Rosie.

40:06.821 --> 40:07.905
Listen.

40:18.874 --> 40:19.875
Wow.

40:21.752 --> 40:22.878
World Symphony.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.131
Outdoor concert.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.551
I never had the money for tickets

40:28.634 --> 40:30.469
so I would come out here
and listen for free.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.264
Forget about everything.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.599
Always alone.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.603
It's amazing, right?

40:40.563 --> 40:43.149
The waves, the music.

40:44.024 --> 40:47.903
They're never the same but they're
always so perfect together.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.116
It's rare, you know?

40:53.242 --> 40:55.536
Takes my breath away every time.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.830
Appreciate you sharing it with me.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.791
But why now?

41:00.875 --> 41:02.209
'Cause I'm leaving, Rosie.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.381
Turns out Adrian got hired
as the Head Pathologist

41:07.465 --> 41:09.633
at a fancy new lab in L.A.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.760
Sorry, I never got to talk
to you about that.

41:11.844 --> 41:15.556
But I was talking to him
on the way over here and he said--

41:15.639 --> 41:17.349
That I was happy for him?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.436
That he'd be crazy to pass it up?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.857
And after everything that's happened,

41:26.150 --> 41:27.818
with Marcos, losing my badge,

41:27.902 --> 41:30.321
wouldn't I be crazy not to go with him?

41:34.408 --> 41:35.659
Well...

41:36.577 --> 41:39.497
I feel like there's this
one magical moment in life

41:41.207 --> 41:44.210
where you think that you have
everything that you'd ever want.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.838
All of a sudden, one person
walks through that door and...

41:51.383 --> 41:52.885
you realize how wrong you were.

41:55.971 --> 41:59.350
So, if you feel that way
about Adrian, then...

42:03.562 --> 42:04.563
Yeah.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.859
You'd be crazy not to go.
