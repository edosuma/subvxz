WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:04.178
[loud crash]
- You have
a hemorrhaging hematoma.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.830
I've specialized
as a trauma surgeon

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
and emergency medical
doctor in Syria.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.313
- We have met before,
of course,

00:09.357 --> 00:10.836
I interviewed you
and then hired you.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.490
I think we need to do it again.

00:12.534 --> 00:13.839
- I know I screwed up.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.754
Taking that job
without telling you was...

00:15.798 --> 00:17.713
- You are almost
in your fourth year, June.

00:17.756 --> 00:21.064
You should consider applying
for the Chief Resident position.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.544
- All could hear was your voice
in my head.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.503
- Telling you what?
- That I'm focusing
on all the wrong things.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.070
[groaning]
- Sir!

00:27.114 --> 00:28.332
He collapsed
and there's not much pulse.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.812
- Ischemic stroke?
- Or hemorrhagic.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.248
- Charging!

00:31.292 --> 00:33.076
- I knew he still had
symptoms.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.251
- Oh, Bash.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.516
- Bashir.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.040
- Rania!

00:48.700 --> 00:51.747
[wind whistling]

00:51.790 --> 00:53.618
- Bashir.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.751
[gentle music]

00:55.794 --> 00:57.622
- Rania.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.450
You were dead.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.322
Everyone thought so.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.423
- Rania was always brutally
honest with me.

01:36.574 --> 01:37.619
- Amira...

01:42.276 --> 01:44.669
- How long have you known
we were here?

01:45.148 --> 01:46.671
- Since you came.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.379
- Bash.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.947
Bash, I know you're already
clocked-out but we need hands.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.645
Multi-car MVC,
they're about to call it!

02:04.776 --> 02:06.343
- They call you Bash?

02:06.387 --> 02:07.605
[laughs]

02:07.649 --> 02:09.172
Did you let them?

02:09.216 --> 02:13.133
- It's growing on me.
- Go be a doctor.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.534
[gentle music]

02:24.492 --> 02:25.667
[sirens wailing]

02:25.710 --> 02:26.755
- You said this place

02:26.798 --> 02:28.713
would swallow me whole
if I let it.

02:29.540 --> 02:32.456
And then you went and had
a stroke which, let's face it,

02:32.500 --> 02:35.198
is a pretty extreme way
to make your point.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.287
[sighing]

02:37.331 --> 02:40.203
[imitates Bishop]: "The past is
the past, Doctor Leblanc.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.510
What matters now
is how you respond."

02:42.945 --> 02:46.166
- Mags. Code Orange.
All available personnel.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.300
- Mags!
- Hey! Do you know
what's going on?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.475
- Just that they're calling
everyone.

02:51.519 --> 02:52.824
Has he said anything yet?
- No...

02:52.868 --> 02:54.826
and the first few hours
are critical.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.001
Hopefully he wakes again soon.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.438
- It's Bishop. He will.
- Yeah.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.440
- Also haven't you been working
two days straight?

02:59.483 --> 03:01.877
- Hum. Says the girl who's about
to double her workload

03:01.920 --> 03:03.792
by throwing in for
Chief Surgical Resident.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.663
- Okay, look,
I became a surgeon

03:05.707 --> 03:07.535
because I prefer my patients
unconscious.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.580
I'm not sure I should be
managing other people.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.974
- Wait! So you're not gonna try
because you're afraid to fail?

03:12.017 --> 03:15.412
- I'm not afraid, Mags, okay?
I just know what my skills are

03:15.456 --> 03:17.022
and what they aren't.
- Mm-hmm.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.242
- Notify the blood bank,
prepare for MTP.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.852
- Where do you want Mr Kline?
- Hallway for now.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.812
We need to make sure all
lower-acuity beds are cleared.

03:23.855 --> 03:24.987
- Copy that!

03:25.030 --> 03:26.641
- See if you can put her
in three. Rhoda?

03:26.684 --> 03:29.861
Who's in two?
- Migraine, DHE. Resolving.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.647
- Okay, put him somewhere else.
Same with the ankle sprain.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.258
- Any idea what we're dealing
with? I can call ahead to OR.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.521
- All I know is a bus
went through a guardrail

03:37.565 --> 03:39.697
on the Bayview extension.
- That's not far from here.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.656
I can go to the site for triage.
- Good, good.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.397
There's a trauma team en route
from St Jacobs, Mags?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.790
- I'm in.
- Update us when you get there.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.749
We run this like he taught us.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.577
[sirens wailing]

03:49.620 --> 03:52.232
[dramatic music]

03:55.017 --> 03:56.627
- Sorry.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.762
Ahem.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
- So what's going to happen now?

04:06.333 --> 04:08.552
With Doctor Bishop out?

04:09.814 --> 04:11.947
- Well, the board appoints
an Acting Chief

04:11.990 --> 04:13.644
until they know his status.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.908
If they're smart, it's Atwater.
If they're stupid...

04:17.474 --> 04:19.649
- Everything changes.

04:24.394 --> 04:27.484
[suspenseful music]

04:27.963 --> 04:29.878
[tires screeching]

04:30.748 --> 04:32.794
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:35.971 --> 04:37.755
- Oh, my God.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.410
[indistinct chatter]

04:42.369 --> 04:44.675
[crying, screaming]

04:48.679 --> 04:51.987
[Bashir]: Let's assess
who's injured then make a plan!

04:52.030 --> 04:53.945
Triage everyone
coming out of the bus.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.599
Priority on the quiet ones.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.035
If they're crying,
they're breathing.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.907
- Help's here, guys.
Help's here.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.691
Come on!

05:03.955 --> 05:05.348
Emily!

05:06.610 --> 05:08.699
Emily! She's not moving,
she needs help!

05:08.743 --> 05:09.918
- Who's not moving?

05:11.093 --> 05:12.312
- Emily and the other kids
in there who can't get out!

05:13.095 --> 05:13.748
- Are you the bus driver?
- Yeah.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.446
I don't know what happened.
I think I hit black ice or--

05:16.490 --> 05:17.795
- Johnny?
She's got a head wound.

05:17.839 --> 05:18.448
- Got it!

05:19.014 --> 05:20.711
- Here, come with me.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.891
- If you can crawl
to the window,
the firefighters will help you!

05:26.935 --> 05:29.851
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.854
Emily!
[coughing]

05:32.897 --> 05:35.335
[panting]

05:35.813 --> 05:37.641
What's your name?
- Lucas.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.470
- It's going to be okay, Lucas.
Where does it hurt most?

05:40.514 --> 05:43.386
[coughs]
- My neck, real bad.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.954
- Where are you coming back
from, Lucas?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.782
- Millwood Arts Camp.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.654
[crying]
It was winter overnight
this weekend,

05:50.698 --> 05:53.004
for the counsellors
in training.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.528
- Any pain besides your neck?

05:54.571 --> 05:57.052
- My hands kinda tingle.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.533
- Squeeze my fingers?

06:01.709 --> 06:02.971
Okay. Good job.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.668
Try to stay very still, okay?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.670
- What's his status?
- Possible fractured vertebra.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.672
We won't know how bad
until we image.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.587
Get him on a spinal board,
try to keep him still.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.850
If he decompensates,
come and find me.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.505
- Okay. Don't move,
everything's gonna be okay.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.028
- Who needs help?

06:17.072 --> 06:18.943
If you can't speak,
raise your hand!

06:25.123 --> 06:27.387
Is your name Emily?

06:28.518 --> 06:30.651
[coughing, gurgling]

06:32.740 --> 06:34.437
- Are you okay?
Can you get out?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.091
Can you get out?
- Mags!

06:36.744 --> 06:38.223
She's got a projectile
in her neck,

06:38.267 --> 06:39.616
right next to her jugular.

06:40.748 --> 06:41.792
We can't move her and
we can't intubate around it.

06:41.836 --> 06:42.837
It has to come out.

06:43.881 --> 06:44.621
- It's too risky.
We need to protect her airway.

06:45.579 --> 06:46.580
- Look, there's no point
if she bleeds out.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.930
- Hang in there, kiddo.

06:50.018 --> 06:50.671
Even if you remove it cleanly,
she's hemorrhaging.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.542
How do you suture a wound
that big here?

06:53.325 --> 06:54.675
- I don't.
Get me the foley cath!

06:57.634 --> 06:59.201
I'll remove the projectile

06:59.244 --> 07:00.681
and you'll stem the bleeding
with that.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.117
- How?
- I'll talk you through it

07:03.379 --> 07:04.902
but it has to be now. There's no
way I'm leaving her like this.

07:11.082 --> 07:14.564
- Morphine, forceps, scalpel.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.657
[distant screaming]

07:20.701 --> 07:22.050
[panting]

07:22.093 --> 07:23.921
- Okay, Emily,

07:25.488 --> 07:26.707
I'm going to remove
the obstruction from your neck
to stop the bleeding.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.450
You're gonna feel a sharp pinch
and some warm liquid, okay?

07:33.888 --> 07:36.630
[suspenseful music]

07:41.765 --> 07:44.507
When the debris comes out,
the cath goes in

07:44.551 --> 07:46.117
and then inflate with saline.
- How much?

07:46.161 --> 07:49.599
- Until you feel resistance.
Trust your instinct, okay?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.122
You're ready?
- Yeah!

07:51.166 --> 07:52.689
- Okay.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.087
Okay, go!

08:03.570 --> 08:05.485
- There!
- Okay.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.225
Okay, good. Good.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.532
[panting]

08:09.837 --> 08:10.620
Emily?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.623
Can you hear me?
Emily? Emily?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.843
Open your eyes
if you can hear me. Emily?

08:15.886 --> 08:17.497
[gasping]

08:18.106 --> 08:19.629
Okay.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.675
Stay with me, Emily.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
[theme music]

08:43.347 --> 08:45.960
[whispering]: Wow,
out like a light.

08:46.003 --> 08:49.093
- Should we move them?
- No, no. Just uh...

08:49.137 --> 08:50.355
just leave them a bit longer.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.662
[phone vibrating]

08:55.839 --> 08:57.798
[exhales]

09:03.281 --> 09:04.805
- You have to go.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.942
- I'm sorry!

09:12.769 --> 09:15.076
[hubbub]

09:16.033 --> 09:17.208
- Alright!
- Mags!

09:17.252 --> 09:18.775
- Yeah?

09:22.170 --> 09:23.824
- Lizzie can't move her leg.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.087
- Hey, Lizzie!
I'm Doctor Leblanc.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.219
How about your toes.
Can you wiggle them?

09:28.263 --> 09:29.873
[mumbling]

09:29.917 --> 09:31.875
LOC's low.
Knee's dislocated.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.008
Leg has no pulse.
We're gonna have to reduce

09:34.051 --> 09:34.835
or she could lose it.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.838
- My bracelet,
I need to find it.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.275
- How about we add this one
to your collection for now,
okay?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.886
Lizzie, we're gonna have to put
your knee back into place.

09:42.930 --> 09:46.063
It's gonna hurt but the worst
part's over fast. Okay?

09:46.107 --> 09:47.587
You're ready?

09:48.109 --> 09:50.720
On three, two, one.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.114
[bone cracking, screaming]

09:54.376 --> 09:56.596
[panting]

09:57.248 --> 10:00.034
- You're doing great Emily, I'm
not going to leave your side.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.644
- Emily?
- Madam, please.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.211
- Let me ride with her!
- It's fine, officer,

10:03.254 --> 10:05.082
she needs
medical attention anyway.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.780
[pants]

10:14.004 --> 10:15.876
[sirens blaring]

10:17.791 --> 10:19.706
We'll be there soon,
okay?

10:20.141 --> 10:21.925
- What happens now?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.927
- We bought some time,
but she lost a lot of blood.

10:23.971 --> 10:27.148
- It's okay, M&M,
I've got you. Hmm?

10:27.191 --> 10:29.324
I've got you. I've got you.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.283
- Why do I feel like you do more
than drive the bus?

10:32.327 --> 10:35.199
- Hmm... I judge talent shows,

10:35.243 --> 10:38.725
and paint theatre
backdrops.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.944
The kids are all
so creative you know?

10:40.988 --> 10:44.208
Her mom owns the camp so,
I've watched Em grow up.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.775
All of them, really.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.298
- How long have you worked
there?

10:47.342 --> 10:49.823
- Hmm, seven years.

10:50.214 --> 10:53.348
It's near Midland, where
I'm from so, not much to see.

10:53.391 --> 10:57.221
- I haven't seen anything
in Canada outside of Toronto,
so...

10:58.396 --> 11:00.921
[panting]
- Hey! Hey!

11:00.964 --> 11:02.444
It's okay.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.272
I got one for you.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.101
Why should you never
trust atoms?

11:07.144 --> 11:08.058
Hm?

11:08.929 --> 11:10.757
No, no, no, don't.
Don't tell me now.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.107
Tell me later,
when you're better okay?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.674
Ooh.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.458
- Are you okay?

11:16.501 --> 11:18.895
- Hum, yeah I'm okay,
I'm just, uh... dizzy.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.854
- You might have a concussion,
we'll check you out too

11:20.897 --> 11:22.377
once we get there.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.292
[machine beeping]

11:24.335 --> 11:27.121
What's wrong?
What's happening?

11:27.164 --> 11:28.862
What is it?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.995
[sobbing]
Hey, it's okay...

11:32.039 --> 11:33.693
I'm right here.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.874
[indistinct chatter]

11:43.050 --> 11:45.313
Lucas? Oh, my God.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.228
- Lucas West.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.056
Impact trauma with potential
spinal complications.

11:49.883 --> 11:50.840
- Alright!
I've gotta get him to CT!

11:51.928 --> 11:52.799
- Emily Parker, projectile
removed from her neck

11:53.800 --> 11:55.018
to address massive blood loss.
BP's 90 over 60,

11:55.062 --> 11:57.064
rate's 90, O2's 80
and dropping.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.979
- Trauma one!
- Doctor Hamed,
what's happening?

11:59.022 --> 12:01.024
- Arnold? She might have
a concussion.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.852
- Oh. Ma'am, why don't
you come with me?

12:02.896 --> 12:05.463
- Female, impact trauma,
dislocated knee reduced on-site.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.378
Rate's stable,
BP's 110 over 80.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.251
- Come on.
It's gonna be fine, okay?

12:13.036 --> 12:16.823
- I need one more large bore IV.
Activate MTP. One gram TXA.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.389
- Blood stats are falling fast!

12:18.433 --> 12:19.956
- One unit O neg,
level one!

12:21.218 --> 12:22.263
- We need to maintain her airway
but I'll tell you right now,

12:23.264 --> 12:23.873
it will be difficult
to visualize her cords.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.223
- Get RT on standby.
I will intubate.

12:26.267 --> 12:29.009
- I can handle that, Wendy.
- Hello, Mark.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.750
- Rough night here, huh?

12:31.054 --> 12:34.144
- Slow up in the ICU?
- Not really.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.887
Tube.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.152
[humming softly]

12:43.240 --> 12:45.416
And... connecting the vent.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.028
- Blood's helping,
MAP's at 65.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.160
She's stabilizing
- O2's coming up.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.946
- I'll call vascular,
she'll need the OR.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.948
- She's gonna need
a lot more than that.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.385
Who rigged up the tamponade
balloon?

12:57.428 --> 12:58.995
- I did.
- Protocol would be

12:59.039 --> 13:01.389
to leave the shrapnel in place
until she got into surgery.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.956
- Protocol would have
killed her.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.088
- Well, let's just agree then,
it was a ballsy move

13:05.132 --> 13:06.437
that may have saved her life.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.439
But, still damaged her airway
when you blew up the balloon

13:09.658 --> 13:10.528
and that's not gonna be good.
What is your name, doctor?

13:10.572 --> 13:11.965
- Bashir Hamed.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.184
- Why don't you get her
cleaned up, Dr Bashir Hamed

13:15.446 --> 13:17.971
and we'll... let the surgeons
tell us what the damage is.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.234
- I'm sorry but who are you?
- Mark Novak.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.976
I'm the Acting Chief
of this emergency department.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.554
- Lucas started gasping for air
on the way back from CT.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.469
- Can I get the ultrasound?
- Yeah.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.731
[grunting, panting]

13:39.775 --> 13:41.516
- I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

13:41.559 --> 13:43.431
- We're gonna find out
what's going on, okay?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.869
There's no lung sliding
on the right side.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.915
Traumatic pneumothorax.
Can I get a 24 French

13:48.958 --> 13:50.046
and a chest tube tray?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.571
We're gonna keep you really
still. Just gonna get your arm
out of the way.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.530
It's gonna help you
breathe better.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.445
Alright, there you go.

13:57.488 --> 13:58.925
Can I get that tube?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.970
Okay.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.016
[breathes heavily]
- What's happening?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.104
- You have a collapsed lung.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.236
But Doctor Curtis is gonna
fix that.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.108
Inserting chest tube now.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.588
- So what are we looking at,
here?

14:10.632 --> 14:12.590
- And... we're in!

14:13.678 --> 14:14.723
Hemo-pneumo.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.595
How does that feel Lucas,
is that better?

14:17.987 --> 14:22.513
- My neck really hurts
and my feet are tingling.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.785
- Positive Babinski sign.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.526
- What, you're thinking
neuro-dysfunction?

14:35.570 --> 14:37.789
- Mm-hmm. His CT should be up
by now.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.922
- Hey, Lucas, that pain
you're talking about

14:39.966 --> 14:41.619
is it sharp or dull?

14:41.663 --> 14:43.926
- Sharp, it's sharp.
- Okay.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.188
- I'm scared.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.711
[heaving breathing]

14:47.887 --> 14:50.106
- Hey, Lucas, what's your
favorite thing to do at camp?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.021
- I'm learning drums.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.806
- Drums? Okay. What kind
of music do you like?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.069
- Loud.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.766
[laughs]

14:59.289 --> 15:01.509
[whispering]:
I'll be right back.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.945
What do you got?

15:02.989 --> 15:04.729
- Look at this.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.644
- It's an atlanto-occipital
dislocation.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.037
It happens during impact
trauma.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.213
His head is only holding on
by muscle and skin.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.781
- Yeah.
Internal decapitation?

15:12.824 --> 15:14.783
He's lucky
we didn't intubate.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.613
- It's gonna be okay.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.745
We're gonna fix it.
You'll see.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.922
[indistinct chatter on PA]

15:23.879 --> 15:25.011
- Bash!

15:25.881 --> 15:27.665
- Didn't you fly home
a few hours ago?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.711
- Yeah, long enough to put
the kids to bed.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.800
Hitched a ride back on
a patient transpo chopper.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.671
- Perks of being an attending
now.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.064
How did Mel take you leaving?

15:35.108 --> 15:37.632
- Hard to argue when a bus
full of kids crashes.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.635
That's brutal. Pedes from
all three shifts were called in.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.071
Hey, I heard what you did
for Emily Parker.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.203
She's lucky you were there.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.900
- Let me know if you need
anything.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.858
- Oh, sorry, here!
Doctor Hunter.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.992
- Hey, so three's waiting
on casting for her ankle.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.168
She's allergic to morphine
so acetaminophen only.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.954
Make sure whoever does Malia's
sutures knows to use a five-O,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.346
nothing larger, and uh...
- Okay.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.218
- The boy in four keeps
taking his dressings off

15:58.261 --> 16:00.220
to post videos
so just keep an eye on that.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.613
- Okay.
Oh, hey, um...

16:02.657 --> 16:04.572
what do you know
about the new Acting Chief?

16:04.615 --> 16:08.054
- Uh, he did his residency
at Memorial back in 05
under Bishop.

16:08.097 --> 16:12.188
Um, joint specialty in ED-ICU,
I believe, then went overseas.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.191
Got back and he's been
an attending in our ICU
for about a month.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.802
Works mostly nights.
That's Janie, three broken ribs

16:17.846 --> 16:19.717
but she's asthmatic
so keep her on albuterol

16:19.761 --> 16:20.718
and check her breathing
every ten.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.285
- Every ten...
[sighs]

16:22.329 --> 16:23.983
Oh! Bash?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.811
Radiologist said to tell you
that CT on Allie Watson
is normal.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.336
No sign of fracture or bleeding
but she did vomit.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.773
- Could still have a concussion.
Thanks.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.254
Arnold?

16:34.297 --> 16:36.343
- Ahem. Tech wasn't positive,

16:36.386 --> 16:38.736
but he said he might have
smelled alcohol.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.129
- You think she was drinking?

16:40.173 --> 16:42.958
- I'm just passing along
the info.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.051
[suspenseful music]

16:54.100 --> 16:55.275
- How's Em?

16:55.318 --> 16:57.016
- They're prepping her
for surgery.

16:57.059 --> 16:57.973
How's your head feeling?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.019
- I'm okay.
What about the others?

17:01.368 --> 17:03.631
I gave the social worker
my phone so she could call
the parents.

17:03.674 --> 17:07.026
- We're on it.
So what about you, Allie?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.636
Is there anyone
we can call for you?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.333
Family you want down here?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.944
- Mm... It's just my mom
and her boyfriend,

17:12.988 --> 17:15.121
but we don't...
we don't talk anymore.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.079
I never really fit in
with anyone from home.

17:18.124 --> 17:22.214
But Sandra built this world
for kids like I was and...

17:22.824 --> 17:24.304
and made me a part of it.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.828
She's the one I'd call.

17:28.395 --> 17:32.051
- Allie, did you have anything
to drink tonight?

17:33.356 --> 17:37.143
- Coffee before we left
and some water.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.319
- No alcohol?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.756
A beer with dinner?
- No, no, no!

17:42.104 --> 17:43.714
You think I was drunk?

17:43.758 --> 17:45.238
Because I threw up?

17:45.281 --> 17:48.284
- No, vomiting can happen
as a result of a head injury,

17:48.328 --> 17:50.112
but our tech said
he smelled alcohol?

17:50.156 --> 17:53.159
- I'm allergic to alcohol.
I never touch it.

17:54.029 --> 17:58.077
- Maybe he mistook disinfectant
or hand sanitizer.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.165
- Yeah.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.254
The police said they have
to do a blood test,

18:02.168 --> 18:02.820
so check it
if you don't believe me!

18:03.778 --> 18:04.474
- It's not that, it's...
the tech smelled it,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.694
so I had to ask, okay?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.828
- So, how angry are you?

18:10.872 --> 18:14.005
- Oh, maybe he's different now.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.920
- You found Lizzie Stahl
in the field?

18:17.226 --> 18:18.314
- Yeah, her knee was dislocated.
- Do we need to page vascular?

18:19.533 --> 18:20.708
- She's stabilized after I
reduced and we gave her morphine

18:22.188 --> 18:23.319
which really knocked her out.
- Well, BP's ticked down
since she got in.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.713
Was there a lot of blood?
- External injuries were scrapes

18:26.583 --> 18:27.323
and bruises
but it could be the knee?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.151
Hematoma from reduction?

18:30.413 --> 18:32.023
[sighs]

18:32.067 --> 18:35.157
- That is a lot of bruising
for a dislocation.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.115
- Yeah.

18:36.985 --> 18:37.986
- Is she on blood thinners
or anemic?

18:38.856 --> 18:39.988
- She was worried about
a bracelet.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.991
I thought she meant
a friendship bracelet but--

18:43.034 --> 18:44.253
Lizzie?

18:44.297 --> 18:45.863
Lizzie, can you look at me?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.996
Lizzie, can you hear me?

18:48.039 --> 18:49.519
Hi, Lizzie.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.131
Was your bracelet
the medic-alert kind?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.307
- Am I bleeding?

18:54.350 --> 18:56.222
- Are you hemophiliac?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.359
- I took it off.
I know it was wrong but...

19:03.403 --> 19:05.405
- I'm Doctor Hunter, Lizzie.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.884
Don't worry.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.017
We're gonna get your bleeding
under control.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.889
- I'm supposed to tell you
I'm type B which means--

19:11.933 --> 19:13.848
- You need clotting
factor nine.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.066
- Are you Leblanc?
- Yes.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.764
- We need you back out there.
- Right.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.635
Copy that, it's just that
we just confirmed

19:18.679 --> 19:21.421
that this patient's
a hemophiliac so I'm gonna
track down her team.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.988
- Short of cloning yourself
I don't see how you're gonna
do that

19:24.032 --> 19:25.425
and clear the orange
and green tags.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.340
Also your schedule
says that you've been on

19:27.383 --> 19:28.950
for two days straight.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.213
- Right, but uh, Doctor Hunter-
- Will be fine.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.997
Unless he thinks he can't
hack this on his own?

19:33.041 --> 19:35.174
- He does not.
- Yeah.

19:40.135 --> 19:43.921
Hey, that tamponade balloon,
where did you learn that trick?

19:43.965 --> 19:46.837
- We used that when we couldn't
get hospital transport.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.231
I was a trauma surgeon
back in Syria.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.799
- And now you're a first-year
resident here?

19:51.842 --> 19:55.106
I ran field hospitals
in Gaza, Libya, and Yemen

19:55.150 --> 19:58.980
for Doctors Without Borders
but, I never made it to Syria.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.287
I know what you're thinking.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.420
Privileged westerner
gets to indulge
his adrenaline addiction.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.422
And yeah, you wouldn't
be wrong but...

20:06.466 --> 20:08.207
- They do important work.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.602
Sir, back in trauma,
if I was short with you

20:12.646 --> 20:14.125
it's only because I--

20:14.169 --> 20:17.128
- You took a risk
to save a kid's life

20:17.172 --> 20:19.261
and you didn't realize you were
talking to your new boss.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.612
And now you don't know
where you stand

20:22.656 --> 20:24.484
after breaking protocol?

20:24.527 --> 20:27.182
Well. I would say,

20:27.226 --> 20:30.316
somewhere between the choice
you made and the outcome.

20:30.359 --> 20:34.015
So, let's see how the kid does.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.063
- Oh, let me guess.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.457
You want me to rush labs
for Lizzie Stahl?

20:41.501 --> 20:44.373
- Nope. She is not
my patient anymore.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.247
How is the new guy already
telling me I got too much
on my plate?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.379
And you know nothing against
Theo, but I'm just saying.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.598
He flew back on a helicopter,

20:51.641 --> 20:53.339
after being home
for like three hours,

20:54.731 --> 20:56.037
and have you ever heard
anyone ask him how much sleep
he got?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.909
- I never have.
- No, exactly. Geez.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.085
What is it about me
that makes people so concerned

21:01.129 --> 21:02.478
with how much I take on,
you know?

21:02.522 --> 21:04.263
It's infantilizing.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.482
What?

21:07.222 --> 21:09.572
- You need their approval.
- I don't.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.313
- I saw you in Bishop's room,

21:11.357 --> 21:13.010
you're wanting him to tell you
what to do

21:13.054 --> 21:14.316
even when he can't talk.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.189
You look up to him, Mags,
but I know him.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.278
He's not God.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.584
He's just another messy
human being who is wrong

21:21.628 --> 21:23.978
as much as he is right.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.243
- That's some light reading?

21:28.722 --> 21:31.028
- Studying to be
a nurse practitioner.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.509
Masters at Night school,
and then a year of clinical.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.033
- That's amazing. You'll be able
to order prescriptions,

21:36.077 --> 21:37.296
and make diagnoses.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.907
- Without needing sign-off
on what I already know.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.564
- That's nice.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.043
Maybe I should be looking
into that...

21:46.087 --> 21:48.089
- Lucas, I'm Doctor Singh.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.134
When you were thrown
from your seat,

21:50.178 --> 21:51.962
you injured your spinal cord.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.574
- Can you undo these?
Please.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.227
- Uh, you need to keep
perfectly still.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.360
- No, I can't.
I need to move.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.971
- Okay, Lucas, this is really
important, okay?

22:01.015 --> 22:02.408
Two of the vertebrae
in your neck are broken.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.497
So if you move,
the part of your spinal cord

22:04.540 --> 22:05.933
that's still attached
will sever.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.978
- Does that mean
that if I can't stay still,

22:08.022 --> 22:10.329
it could kill me?
- What we're saying, son,

22:10.372 --> 22:12.592
is we're gonna take you
to surgery to fix this.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.550
But until we get there--
- No, no, no, no.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.986
I can't, I can't, I can't.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.336
- Prepare two
milligrams of Ativan.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.947
- Okay, I understand, Lucas,
okay, I get it.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.297
Trust me,
I hate staying still also

22:22.341 --> 22:25.213
and it makes my skin crawl
when someone tells me
that I have to.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.346
- My mother says
I never stop moving.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.305
- My mom says the same thing.
And then I became a surgeon

22:30.349 --> 22:32.394
and other people's lives
in my hands,

22:32.438 --> 22:34.396
just... there's just no room
for wrong moves.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.966
So I had to learn how to control
that panicky feeling.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.969
I'm pretty sure that if I can
do it, you can do it too.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.362
[panting]

22:43.405 --> 22:44.450
- How?

22:45.451 --> 22:48.279
- How? Well, uh, we start
by setting the mood.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.325
Get the lights, Doctor Singh?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.414
Please.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.201
So, uh, no talking.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.290
Focus on what you can hear.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.988
Can you hear your heart beating?

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
It sounds like drums, right?

23:02.642 --> 23:06.123
Focus on that rhythm,
it's a little fast right now.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.038
You need to bring that down.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.997
So see if you can use
your breathing,

23:10.040 --> 23:13.174
to slow down the rhythm
of that beat.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.351
Focus on that rhythm.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.353
Slow down that beat.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.051
You're nailing it.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.099
[gentle music]

23:39.113 --> 23:41.115
- How is she?

23:41.463 --> 23:42.725
- You're hurt!

23:42.769 --> 23:44.379
They didn't tell me.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.165
- I'm okay.
Maybe a small concussion.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.517
- I'm so glad you're alright.

23:52.126 --> 23:56.130
Allie, what happened?

23:57.131 --> 23:59.220
- I don't know.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.353
It was... it was all so fast.

24:02.397 --> 24:06.053
Everything was fine
and then... then it wasn't.

24:06.575 --> 24:11.188
We must have hit ice or...
Sandra, I'm so sorry.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.322
I'll talk to the parents,
okay?

24:16.237 --> 24:18.369
- Um, Allie, you should be
off your feet.

24:18.413 --> 24:21.285
- This is the doctor
who saved Em.

24:21.329 --> 24:23.679
This is Sandra,
Emily's mom.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.202
She owns the camp.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.553
- They said that you had
to take drastic measures

24:27.596 --> 24:30.556
to save her life.
- Emily was extremely brave.

24:32.601 --> 24:35.299
Uh, Allie, can I speak with you
for a moment?

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
- I know you said to rest
but I...

24:39.565 --> 24:41.436
I had to see her.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.352
- Allie?
- Are you okay?

24:44.395 --> 24:46.223
[breathing heavily]
- It's weird, my--

24:46.267 --> 24:47.529
- Okay, come with me, Allie,
come on.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.184
- What's happening? Is she okay?
- My throat feels full.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.620
It's hard to swallow.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.796
- Okay, Arnold point three
milligrams epi right now.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.537
[breathes heavily]

24:55.581 --> 24:56.625
Sit...

24:56.669 --> 24:58.497
Breathe calmly, okay?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.332
I'm giving you an injection
of epinephrine.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.639
You're having
an allergic reaction,

25:10.683 --> 25:12.423
this will help
with the symptoms.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.556
- An allergic reaction to what?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.167
- Um...
- Is she okay?

25:17.211 --> 25:19.343
- Um... She will be.
She'll be fine.

25:19.387 --> 25:22.390
- She's only allergic to alcohol
and she doesn't drink.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.784
She was drinking?

25:24.827 --> 25:26.568
- Why don't we just
let Allie get--

25:26.612 --> 25:27.613
- Allie.

25:28.657 --> 25:29.353
- What happened, Doctor Hamed?
[breathes heavily]

25:30.006 --> 25:31.573
- Allie, you were drinking?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.575
When you knew
you were driving our kids?

25:33.619 --> 25:34.663
- No!

25:34.707 --> 25:36.535
No! I would never.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.539
You did a blood test,
tell her what it said!

25:42.410 --> 25:45.282
- He came looking for you
because of what it said.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.414
Allie, how could you?

25:46.457 --> 25:48.677
- There has to be
another explanation!

25:48.721 --> 25:50.331
- I'm sorry, Allie.
- No!

25:50.374 --> 25:52.463
Emily, the kids
are everything to me!

25:52.507 --> 25:54.596
You know me!
- No! Not anymore!

25:54.640 --> 25:56.206
Not the way I thought!

25:56.250 --> 25:57.512
[crying]
- Sandra!

25:57.556 --> 25:59.601
- I can't, I can't even
look at you.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.560
- Please! Please.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.565
[dramatic music]

26:12.135 --> 26:14.050
- Hey, we're almost there.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.313
- Curtis is scrubbing in.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.446
- It's... There's three teams,
Aajay.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.839
It's already pretty crowded.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.144
- June made the diagnosis,

26:21.188 --> 26:23.320
and the patient is asking
for her personally.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.758
- Fine.
Observation only.

26:27.498 --> 26:30.632
- I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.
You're doing great.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.636
- Sutton gets a vote on
Chief Resident.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.812
Don't keep him waiting.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.774
- Admitting needs
a detailed projection

26:41.817 --> 26:43.471
of who you're keeping.
- I know.

26:43.514 --> 26:46.648
Just after I get
to the four sets of parents
waiting for me.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.651
- I'll find out what Novak
wants for paperwork.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.828
Doctor Bishop likes
every intake, every discharge

26:52.872 --> 26:55.091
on his desk
an hour after your shift.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.353
- How's he doing?

26:56.397 --> 26:59.269
Bishop.
- Well, too early to say.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.446
- Long night?

27:02.490 --> 27:04.318
- Emily Parker's in surgery?

27:04.361 --> 27:06.755
- I'll keep you in the loop.
- Thanks.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.280
[cellphone ringing]

27:11.934 --> 27:13.153
- You like it?

27:13.196 --> 27:14.502
Just like Mama's.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.200
- Amira, it's so late.
You have school tomorrow.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.863
[chuckles]

27:29.125 --> 27:30.997
- I... I have to stay here
a little while longer.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.694
You can bring her
to the hospital if--

27:32.738 --> 27:33.869
- We're fine.

27:34.914 --> 27:35.915
I promise
she'll get some sleep.

27:36.916 --> 27:37.438
- Okay, I'll come get you
as soon as I'm done.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.048
Go to sleep.

27:46.055 --> 27:47.796
Bashir...

27:53.976 --> 27:57.240
- The surgeons were able
to repair the wound
to Emily's artery.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.200
But her trachea was damaged
when our doctor
stopped her bleeding.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.202
- Why? Why would he do that?

28:02.245 --> 28:04.030
There wasn't any other way?

28:04.073 --> 28:06.772
- If he'd waited any longer,
she would have bled to death.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.166
We've done everything possible
to repair the damage.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.822
Now it's up to her to...
see how she recovers.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.826
I'm sorry I have to say this.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.787
But if her airway doesn't heal,
there's a chance

28:21.830 --> 28:24.311
that Emily won't be able
to breathe on her own again.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.010
The next few hours are
critical.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.276
I know it's a lot to take in.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.236
- I don't accept any of it.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.066
[sobbing]

28:44.418 --> 28:45.549
- Hey, Lizzie.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.160
The firemen found this.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.248
[laughs]

28:48.291 --> 28:49.902
Are your parents around?

28:49.945 --> 28:52.295
- Probably with my hemophilia
team somewhere,

28:52.339 --> 28:54.471
deciding all the things I won't
be allowed to do anymore.

28:54.515 --> 28:55.908
- They only want you to be safe.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.171
- The Cabin Five girls
were doing a play.

28:58.214 --> 29:01.261
They always say mine are
too weird but,

29:01.304 --> 29:03.176
this year they chose it.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.221
They all wore five bracelets
and...

29:05.265 --> 29:06.179
- You had six.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.921
- I just liked to feel normal
for once.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.488
- Let me tell you something,
Lizzie. Normal is boring.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.491
I know it's hard to see this
now or ever, really, but...

29:14.535 --> 29:17.494
but you know, the things
that set you apart,

29:17.538 --> 29:19.453
even the hard ones,

29:19.496 --> 29:21.934
they're the ones
that make you strong.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.023
[coughs]

29:24.066 --> 29:25.502
You okay?

29:25.546 --> 29:27.287
[coughing]
- I think something's wrong.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.419
Chest hurts. I can't--

29:29.463 --> 29:31.247
- Claire!

29:35.034 --> 29:36.252
Okay.

29:36.296 --> 29:39.212
I need to look at the site
of your bleeding.

29:42.084 --> 29:44.130
Okay, I need a large dose
of rtPA,

29:44.173 --> 29:46.262
point five milligrams
per kilo per hour.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.916
Then page Theo and heme!

29:47.960 --> 29:49.309
- What's happening?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.572
- So a large blood clot formed
after your injury.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.226
And it's now travelled
to your lungs.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.575
So I'm gonna need to use
something called

29:54.618 --> 29:56.490
a thrombolytic agent
to dissolve it.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.361
- A clot-buster?
But if we do that,

29:58.405 --> 30:00.276
my blood thins,
won't that make me bleed more?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.452
- A clot's a bigger risk.
You can handle this, Lizzie.

30:02.496 --> 30:03.540
Okay? You need to.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.978
Theo?
- Nothing yet.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.849
[coughs]

30:09.372 --> 30:10.896
- It's okay!
It's just blood.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.158
We need to do this now.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.899
[breathes heavily]
We can't wait.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.989
Okay, give me your arm.
Lie back.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.947
Here we go.
- Like this.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.210
- Okay? Good.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.516
- What now?

30:22.559 --> 30:24.561
- We wait.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.259
Together.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.881
- Hey!
New labs on Allie Watson.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.491
But it's weird.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.145
- What? Her blood alcohol
level went up?

30:43.189 --> 30:44.886
- Like I said.
Weird.

30:44.930 --> 30:48.368
Um. No way she's had a drink
while she's been here.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.501
- She may not have had to.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.677
There's a rare bacterial
reaction

30:53.721 --> 30:55.941
where your GI system
creates its own alcohol.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.378
It's called auto brewery
syndrome.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.815
Did you have any bread
tonight? Pasta?

31:00.859 --> 31:01.816
- Pizza.

31:02.773 --> 31:03.774
- Well, the right carbs
at the wrong time

31:04.775 --> 31:05.733
and you basically become
your own distillery.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.823
- But why now?
I've always eaten those things.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.608
- There are emergent digestive
conditions that can trigger it.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.784
Even being on antibiotics
for a really long time.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.962
- Yeah. I've been on and off
them for sinus infections.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.703
- Your stomach continued
to produce its own alcohol,

31:19.747 --> 31:22.706
which is why your reaction
was delayed in the first place.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.100
Thanks, Arnold.
You're on an epi drip now,

31:25.144 --> 31:27.755
and we're gonna give you some
activated charcoal to drink

31:27.798 --> 31:29.931
so that should stop the reaction
completely.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.543
It doesn't look very appetizing
but I promise it will help.

31:39.636 --> 31:40.942
[sighing]

31:40.986 --> 31:42.901
- Then I was drunk?

31:43.510 --> 31:46.426
Maybe, I didn't realize.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.036
How could I have known?

31:48.080 --> 31:49.472
- This isn't your fault, Allie.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.606
Okay? And I'm gonna make sure
Sandra knows that.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.698
- You must be exhausted.
- Huh.

31:58.003 --> 32:01.006
Were the girls upset I wasn't
there when they woke up?

32:01.049 --> 32:02.181
- Uh...

32:02.224 --> 32:03.922
A little, but...

32:05.401 --> 32:07.229
you know a bus full of kids,
that has to be more important.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.449
- Mel, that's not,
that's not what I meant.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.974
Look, good news is, I've already
bought my flight pass

32:13.018 --> 32:14.976
so I'll be able to go back
and forth four,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.152
even five times a week.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.588
- Theo.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.590
- No, I've got it
all planned out. Okay?

32:20.634 --> 32:22.984
I'm gonna do my scheduling,
and...

32:23.028 --> 32:24.899
and my charts, I'm gonna do them
all on the plane

32:24.943 --> 32:26.770
so when I get home,
there's no work.

32:26.814 --> 32:29.469
Half the doctors here
they commute from the suburbs.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.905
It's like a two-hour drive
with traffic,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.820
so I mean, this is...
it's no different.

32:32.863 --> 32:35.605
- I'm just not sure
that's realistic.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.694
Look.
- Mel, what--

32:37.738 --> 32:39.958
- I've gotta go.
We'll talk about it later?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.698
Okay?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.178
Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.614
- Bye.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.669
- You heard about Allie?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.977
- Maybe she didn't drink
but...

32:59.803 --> 33:01.980
she must have felt something.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.939
She should have pulled over.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.158
Stopped driving.

33:07.420 --> 33:10.118
- I only found Emily in time
to save her because of Allie.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.772
She loves her.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.688
She's terrified of losing
the life that she's built
with you.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.995
- I care about her too but...

33:17.256 --> 33:19.171
She'll have to find a new job.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.956
This is my daughter,

33:24.219 --> 33:26.656
who may never breathe
on her own again

33:26.700 --> 33:29.529
because of what
both of you did.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.665
- We need to talk about you
giving Lizzie Stahl

33:35.709 --> 33:38.190
a thrombolytic agent.
- Well, we paged you.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.626
And we both know
that if I'd waited--

33:39.669 --> 33:41.541
- There are two hematologists
here from her team,

33:41.584 --> 33:43.064
plus two very
worried parents...

33:43.108 --> 33:44.631
- Theo!
- And a new acting chief

33:44.674 --> 33:45.893
and I had to explain
to all of them

33:45.936 --> 33:47.547
why this happened
without their input.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.679
- Theo, I went in
to return her backpack

33:49.723 --> 33:51.812
and she crashed because--
- If I wanted your help

33:51.855 --> 33:55.685
and I wanted you to check
on my patients, I will ask you!

34:05.869 --> 34:08.089
- Was Doctor Bishop here
during your residency?

34:08.132 --> 34:10.047
- Has he ever not been here?

34:12.266 --> 34:13.833
- Um...

34:13.877 --> 34:15.705
Doctor Novak,
Emily Parker, she's--

34:15.748 --> 34:17.620
- She's touch and go yeah.
I heard.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.143
I also heard what you did
for him.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.971
How you saved his life.

34:21.710 --> 34:23.583
You've made some hard choices.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.585
Friends I've had,
doctors from overseas

34:25.628 --> 34:27.065
who tried to make it
over here,

34:27.108 --> 34:29.197
those skills,
they don't always translate.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.853
You're one of the lucky ones,
Bashir Hamed.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.088
[indistinct chatter on PA]

34:50.784 --> 34:53.264
- I heard Lucas is gonna
recover completely.

34:53.308 --> 34:56.137
- Yeah, just this kid is like
a millimeter from death,

34:56.181 --> 34:58.574
and somehow he still manages
to hold it all together.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.576
- He had some help.

35:01.403 --> 35:04.276
- I've been thinking
about all the reasons

35:04.319 --> 35:06.713
I've been afraid to throw in
for Chief Resident.

35:06.756 --> 35:10.108
And... I don't know,
I guess tonight

35:10.151 --> 35:11.587
I realized that none
of that really matters.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.198
I want it, you know?
So...

35:13.459 --> 35:16.505
I don't know whatever,
I guess I'll just have to...

35:16.549 --> 35:18.333
learn as I go.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.640
- If you get it.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.170
[knocking]

35:29.562 --> 35:31.477
- Come in, Leblanc.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.740
- You changed the lamp.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.176
You moved it.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.178
- There's something you needed?
- Um...

35:37.222 --> 35:39.398
I wanted to tell you
that I made the call

35:39.441 --> 35:41.269
to give Lizzie Parker
thrombolytics

35:41.313 --> 35:43.141
without consulting Doctor Hunter
first because--

35:43.184 --> 35:44.403
- It was the right call.

35:44.446 --> 35:45.795
- I know.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.145
- Okay.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.583
So did you just come here
to apologize for making
the right call?

35:50.626 --> 35:51.801
- No.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.153
I heard you when you said
that Lizzie was Theo's patient.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.285
But I still went in
to check on her because--

35:57.329 --> 35:59.157
- I know doctors like you.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.681
You stay late.
You over-invest,

36:01.724 --> 36:04.466
you really truly care
about the patients

36:04.510 --> 36:07.774
instead of looking at them like
they're needy bags of meat.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.385
And that's admirable.
- Look if you're gonna tell me

36:10.429 --> 36:12.213
that I need to find
some kind of balance--

36:12.257 --> 36:14.520
- No, I don't care if you work
four days straight

36:14.563 --> 36:16.826
and don't sleep.
You're a grown-up.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.786
But it doesn't make you
any better or smarter

36:19.829 --> 36:22.702
than anyone else here.
- No, I never said that it did.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.704
- But you think it.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.662
Don't try to tell me you don't.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.448
And the truth is if you weren't
in Lizzie's room?

36:29.491 --> 36:31.450
Her vitals monitor would have
alerted somebody else

36:31.493 --> 36:33.452
and they would have made
the same call as you did.

36:33.495 --> 36:37.282
I don't care what kind
of a doctor you are, Leblanc.
[pager beeping]

36:37.325 --> 36:40.676
I just need you to do your job,
like everybody else.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.683
[gentle music]

36:50.382 --> 36:52.210
[sighing]

37:04.309 --> 37:06.746
- She needs a few seconds
for the sedation to wear off

37:06.789 --> 37:07.877
and then we'll listen.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.618
- What happens
if she can't get air?

37:09.662 --> 37:11.272
- We're here.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.753
It's time to see
if she can breathe on her own.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.407
- Hi, Emily.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.236
Can you breathe for us?

37:21.587 --> 37:24.242
[inhaling]

37:27.897 --> 37:30.248
- There you go.

37:30.552 --> 37:31.771
That's it.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.644
You did it. Great job.

37:35.688 --> 37:36.906
She sounds perfect.

37:36.950 --> 37:40.736
- Oh, my baby,
you're so strong!

37:41.476 --> 37:45.263
I love you so, so much.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.754
[soft music]

38:07.328 --> 38:10.505
[Bashir]: Why should you
never trust atoms?

38:14.466 --> 38:17.295
Because they make up
everything.

38:17.947 --> 38:20.385
Emily wanted me
to tell you that.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.518
- Thanks.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.750
[exhaling]

38:39.099 --> 38:41.319
[gentle music]

38:42.015 --> 38:44.147
- One of us should say
something.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.541
- It's good to hear
your voice again, sir.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.238
- Huh.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.068
[chuckles]

38:52.112 --> 38:54.201
- Just ask.

38:55.507 --> 38:58.031
- How'd we do tonight?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.164
[soft chuckles]

39:07.388 --> 39:08.868
- Hey!
- Hey.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.349
- Is it just me or this shift
started about a year ago?

39:11.392 --> 39:13.307
- It definitely is not
just you.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.441
- Do you wanna celebrate it
finally being over
with a drink?

39:17.093 --> 39:19.531
- Uh, um... I have to take Amira
to school.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.054
- Right.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.317
Right it is morning after all.
Oh, it's alright!

39:23.361 --> 39:25.188
[chuckles]

39:26.102 --> 39:28.888
- I've been trying to
manufacture a three-day weekend

39:28.931 --> 39:31.978
to make up for today
but it's impossible.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.067
- If you move Petro
to Tuesday

39:34.110 --> 39:35.895
and convince Levine
to pull a double.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.114
[laughs]
- Thank you.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.030
- Scheduling sounds like
a nightmare.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.075
- Yeah?

39:43.119 --> 39:44.425
Well, I heard you were up
for a career bump too

39:44.469 --> 39:45.948
so get used to it!

39:45.992 --> 39:47.994
- They'd be idiots
not to pick you.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.128
- I was excited for you.
I'm sorry.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.391
[laughter]

39:53.434 --> 39:54.827
- Seriously, guys.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.959
Just... I don't wanna
jinx it.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.049
- Well, on that note.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.269
I'm gonna go sleep
for 12 hours.

40:02.312 --> 40:03.401
I'll see you later.

40:03.444 --> 40:04.489
- Good night!

40:04.532 --> 40:06.316
- Have a good night!

40:06.360 --> 40:10.146
- I could really use
a greasy breakfast.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.365
Are you hungry?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.106
- I'm famished.

40:13.149 --> 40:14.194
[laughs]

40:14.455 --> 40:16.239
- Ow, come on.

40:23.029 --> 40:24.596
- You're too late for pizza.

40:24.639 --> 40:27.033
- Sorry. Long night.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.253
- We had fun.

41:25.613 --> 41:28.442
- I could have. I wanted to.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.054
For a long time I didn't know
where you were,

41:32.664 --> 41:34.187
and...

41:34.230 --> 41:38.452
when I finally heard
that you made it,

41:38.496 --> 41:42.412
that you came here
with your sister for...

41:43.283 --> 41:45.067
...for a new life.

41:45.459 --> 41:48.375
The Bashir I knew would have
risked everything

41:48.418 --> 41:50.943
to come get me
and I didn't want you

41:50.986 --> 41:53.467
to make that choice.

41:55.295 --> 41:57.036
- So you made it for me?

41:57.079 --> 41:59.299
[gentle music]

41:59.604 --> 42:02.215
- I understand
if you can't accept that.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.756
[sighing]

42:21.800 --> 42:23.976
[soft music]

42:49.088 --> 42:51.003
Subtitling: difuze
