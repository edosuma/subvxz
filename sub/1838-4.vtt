EXCELLENT JOB,
BY THE WAY.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.800

EXCUSE ME,

21:16.934 --> 21:18.300
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE CLEANERS.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.300
BUT YOU'RE AT--
GOOD-BYE, TIFFANIE.

SO, DID EVERYTHING WORK OUT
WITH YOU AND RAE?

21:31.400 --> 21:33.133
YEAH. I THINK
FROM NOW ON

21:33.133 --> 21:35.734

21:37.300 --> 21:40.500
SHE AND RHONDA CAME
TO AN UNDERSTANDING.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.600
[DOORBELL RINGS]

21:41.600 --> 21:43.200
OH, I GOT IT.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.400
