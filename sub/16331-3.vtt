00:06.519 --> 00:07.685
Matt!

00:07.687 --> 00:09.654
It was something
from a nightmare.

00:09.656 --> 00:11.422
(insects buzzing)

00:15.595 --> 00:16.460
Flora!

00:16.462 --> 00:18.796
Flora?

00:18.798 --> 00:20.464
Shelby!

00:20.466 --> 00:21.532
(screams)

00:21.534 --> 00:22.800
LEE:
<i> We've had to now</i>

00:22.802 --> 00:24.802
accept the real possibility

00:24.804 --> 00:26.837
<i> that we were</i>
<i> looking for a body.</i>

00:33.946 --> 00:37.715
There is no fear like the fear
of losing a child.

00:37.717 --> 00:40.851
It is primal.

00:40.853 --> 00:43.287
And it's wrenching.

00:51.664 --> 00:52.830
MAN:
Got it.

00:52.832 --> 00:56.767
(footfalls descending ladder)

01:04.677 --> 01:06.911
(sniffs, exhales)

01:08.681 --> 01:09.880
It's Flora's.

01:09.882 --> 01:11.098
I can't explain it.

01:11.099 --> 01:12.315
Seems like you folks
have been involved

01:12.318 --> 01:13.484
with a lot of that lately.

01:13.486 --> 01:15.653
Well, that's a goddamn thing
to say.

01:15.655 --> 01:16.687
I was grateful,

01:16.689 --> 01:18.089
for all the volunteers

01:18.091 --> 01:21.258
who were helping
to look for my daughter.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.761
But the police
were a different matter.

01:23.763 --> 01:25.396
I was a cop.

01:25.398 --> 01:28.532
There are thousands of acres
of woods out there,

01:28.534 --> 01:29.700
places no one's ever seen.

01:29.702 --> 01:31.102
Then what the hell
are we waiting on?

01:31.104 --> 01:33.504
(Lee sighs)
Let's get to work.

01:33.506 --> 01:36.340
LEE:<i> And I can sense</i>
<i> when something's off.</i>

01:36.342 --> 01:37.775
<i> For all I knew,</i>
<i> they were in bed</i>

01:37.777 --> 01:39.844
<i> with the hillbillies</i>
<i> who took my Flora.</i>

01:43.850 --> 01:46.717
As a cop, I knew the chances
of finding my daughter

01:46.719 --> 01:49.019
were cut in half
after 36 hours

01:49.021 --> 01:50.955
of her being reported missing.

01:51.924 --> 01:53.791
<i> After 72,</i>

01:53.793 --> 01:55.860
<i> it's less than 30%.</i>

01:58.631 --> 02:01.532
<i> In this country,</i>
<i> over 33,000 kids are missing</i>

02:01.534 --> 02:02.800
<i> at any given time.</i>

02:02.802 --> 02:04.869
(indistinct radio chatter)
Thank you.

02:06.472 --> 02:08.239
Hi. Thank you.
Her name's Flora.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.908
My Flora was not gonna be
one of those damn numbers.

02:10.910 --> 02:12.810
Thank you so much.

02:12.812 --> 02:15.146
We were each responsible
for searching

02:15.148 --> 02:16.781
<i> our own area of the forest.</i>

02:16.783 --> 02:18.916
Flora!
Flora?

02:18.918 --> 02:21.318
<i> I didn't want to be</i>
<i> out there alone.</i>

02:21.320 --> 02:22.586
Flora?

02:22.588 --> 02:24.155
<i> To be perfectly honest, I...</i>

02:24.157 --> 02:27.057
I was petrified.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.959
MATT:<i> It was a</i>
<i> very stressful situation.</i>

02:28.961 --> 02:30.127
<i> Walking in that forest,</i>

02:30.129 --> 02:32.129
<i> your mind starts</i>
<i> to play tricks.</i>

02:32.131 --> 02:34.398
<i> The lights and shadows</i>
<i> in the trees</i>

02:34.400 --> 02:36.467
<i> begin to take on forms</i>
<i> and shapes. </i>
WOMAN: Flora!

02:36.469 --> 02:38.836
Creatures, apparitions sprung
from the subconscious.

02:38.838 --> 02:41.105
But what we found...

02:41.107 --> 02:43.641
wasn't just in my imagination.

02:55.121 --> 02:56.654
Matt!

02:57.623 --> 02:58.989
Shelby!

03:14.774 --> 03:16.040
LEE:
Don't touch it!

03:17.143 --> 03:20.010
There could be evidence.

03:20.012 --> 03:22.112
MATT: Are you sure
that's Flora's doll?

03:22.114 --> 03:23.814
Look what they did to it.

03:23.816 --> 03:26.350
It's evil.

03:26.352 --> 03:27.985
She was here.

03:27.987 --> 03:29.954
She's close by.

03:29.956 --> 03:32.656
Flora!

03:32.658 --> 03:34.825
Flora!
(birds scattering)

03:34.827 --> 03:37.995
It was something
from a nightmare.

03:37.997 --> 03:41.632
<i> About a hundred yards</i>
<i> from where we found the doll,</i>

03:41.634 --> 03:45.202
<i> we stumbled onto</i>
<i> this skeleton of a farm.</i>

03:45.204 --> 03:46.971
<i> Looked like a place no one</i>

03:46.973 --> 03:50.241
wanted to be, but there was
a chance Flora was inside.

04:00.419 --> 04:02.753
(insects buzzing)

04:05.024 --> 04:06.924

04:06.926 --> 04:08.559
Flora?

04:21.073 --> 04:23.107
SHELBY:
Oh, my God.

04:24.076 --> 04:27.411
Who lives like this?

04:27.413 --> 04:30.447
(blows, sighs)

04:33.019 --> 04:35.085
Ugh.

04:38.024 --> 04:39.256
She's not here.

04:39.258 --> 04:40.724
Whole place is empty.

04:40.726 --> 04:42.026
(pig squealing)

04:42.028 --> 04:43.227
What's that?

04:43.229 --> 04:45.029
Something is still here.

04:48.701 --> 04:49.767
LEE:
Ugh.

04:55.074 --> 04:56.540

05:04.116 --> 05:05.549

05:22.935 --> 05:26.070

05:26.072 --> 05:29.206

05:32.979 --> 05:35.079
Flora.

05:35.081 --> 05:37.448
Flora.
Flora.

05:37.450 --> 05:39.183
Flora!
Flora!

05:48.494 --> 05:49.860
Matt brought the cops
to the farm.

05:49.862 --> 05:50.928
They were just as shocked
as we were

05:50.930 --> 05:53.163
by what we found in that barn.

05:53.165 --> 05:55.799
There was no sign of the rest
of the Polk family.

05:55.801 --> 05:58.302
It was like they just took off

05:58.304 --> 06:00.704
and abandoned those...

06:00.706 --> 06:02.773
poor things.

06:02.775 --> 06:06.510
All I kept thinking was
if that family treated

06:06.512 --> 06:09.513
their own flesh and blood
like animals,

06:09.515 --> 06:11.482
<i> what were they doing</i>
<i> to my baby?</i>

06:11.484 --> 06:13.984
We did a thorough search
of the farmhouse

06:13.986 --> 06:16.053
and based on what
we could gather,

06:16.055 --> 06:18.689
they were occupying
the land illegally.

06:18.691 --> 06:21.892
Now, it looks like they probably
knew we were coming, so they

06:21.894 --> 06:24.194
took the girl
and fled before

06:24.196 --> 06:25.996
we could catch them.
I guess they figured

06:25.998 --> 06:29.033
those boys could
fend for themselves.

06:29.035 --> 06:31.135
Oh, Jesus.
And now they could be anywhere.

06:31.137 --> 06:32.169
(door opens)

06:32.171 --> 06:34.171
MAN:
Sir, sir, you can't go in there!

06:34.173 --> 06:36.140
LEE: Mason, I'm so sorry.
Where are they?

06:36.142 --> 06:39.143
The boys we found are
in the interview room.

06:39.145 --> 06:41.011
Someone's talking to them now.

06:41.013 --> 06:44.148
I can do my own interrogating.
Hey, sir!

06:44.150 --> 06:46.016
I can't let you go in there.
That's my kid they took!

06:46.018 --> 06:47.384
MATT:
Mason, let them do their job.

06:47.386 --> 06:48.919
For Flora's sake.

06:48.921 --> 06:51.188
Come on, man.

06:51.190 --> 06:53.257
Come on, brother.

06:55.528 --> 06:59.229
SHELBY:
<i> A social worker tried</i>
<i> talking to those boys</i>

06:59.231 --> 07:01.765

07:01.767 --> 07:04.735
they could barely speak.

07:04.737 --> 07:06.737
I'll give you another piece

07:06.739 --> 07:08.939

Croatoan!

07:10.176 --> 07:12.176
That was all they said.

07:12.178 --> 07:15.079
It was the only word
they knew.

07:15.081 --> 07:16.780
At the time...

07:16.782 --> 07:20.217
none of us understood
what it meant.

07:20.219 --> 07:22.052
But we'd later
come to understand

07:22.054 --> 07:24.054
that it was a warning.

...and neither was I.

We hadn't slept in days.

08:25.651 --> 08:27.951
It was time to take a break.

None of us wanted to,
but we couldn't see straight.

08:59.985 --> 09:01.118
You were gonna lose

custody of her,

You'd have been lucky

What's your plan?

Mason, stop.

09:13.899 --> 09:14.965
Now, you know me.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.133

You kidnapped her!

From school.

09:21.307 --> 09:23.073
It's time the police

If they focused on Lee,

09:34.019 --> 09:35.552
suddenly nobody's
out looking for Flora.

09:35.554 --> 09:37.187

(indistinct radio chatter)

11:09.481 --> 11:11.281
Let me through.
Let me through!

11:11.283 --> 11:12.683
Let me through! Move!

11:12.685 --> 11:14.351
Flora...

11:19.425 --> 11:21.625
LEE:
Oh...

11:21.627 --> 11:24.261
CONNELL:
Forensics removed this
from the body.

11:24.263 --> 11:26.363
Ma'am...

11:34.707 --> 11:36.573
Oh, my God.

11:38.310 --> 11:39.710
It's Mason.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.491
I was so messed up
after seeing Mason

11:54.493 --> 11:56.727
that I almost missed
two alerts on my phone.

11:56.729 --> 11:58.528
<i> Whenever the motion sensors</i>
<i> are activated,</i>

11:58.530 --> 12:00.330
<i> the cameras record everything</i>
<i> to my computer.</i>

12:00.332 --> 12:01.898
MATT:
That's Lee.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.302
22:13 is about
a quarter after 10:00.

12:05.304 --> 12:08.538
She left the house
15 minutes after Mason.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.907
And that's Lee
coming back...

12:10.909 --> 12:12.242
Oh...

12:12.244 --> 12:14.378
...four hours later.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.545
(sighs)

12:17.349 --> 12:19.216
(exhales)
(sighs)

12:20.719 --> 12:23.553
I know she's your sister,

12:23.555 --> 12:25.355
and blood is
thicker than water,

12:25.357 --> 12:27.190
but the cops don't know
what happened last night

12:27.192 --> 12:28.525
and we do.

12:28.527 --> 12:30.360
Shelby, don't go there.

12:30.362 --> 12:33.430
Mason was going to the police
to tell them about Lee.

12:33.432 --> 12:34.865
She was desperate.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.634
Desperate people
can do terrible things.
(floorboard creaks)

12:40.372 --> 12:42.572
Shelby.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.510
You honestly believe

12:46.512 --> 12:48.345
that I'm capable of murder?

12:50.382 --> 12:52.282
We're all...

12:52.284 --> 12:54.584
Goddamn it!

12:54.586 --> 12:57.421
I will not stand
to be accused

12:57.423 --> 12:59.156
and not by
my own family.

13:00.392 --> 13:01.725
It's obvious that

13:01.727 --> 13:04.027
I'm not welcome here.
You're right.

13:04.029 --> 13:06.396
We're family,
and we trust you, Lee.

13:06.398 --> 13:07.464
But you're right.

13:07.466 --> 13:08.765
We're not welcome here.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.100
None of us are.
(door creaks open)

13:10.102 --> 13:11.101
Something is trying

13:11.103 --> 13:12.402
to tell us to leave,

13:12.404 --> 13:14.237
and maybe it's time
we listen and go.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.440
Stay at a hotel for now.

13:16.442 --> 13:17.974
MAN:
After what happened,

13:17.976 --> 13:19.609
you should keep the door locked.

13:25.617 --> 13:27.751
I was called

13:27.753 --> 13:30.220
to help you find
your little girl.

13:32.624 --> 13:34.424
LEE:
<i> Who was this guy?</i>

13:34.426 --> 13:37.461
Had the FBI called him?

13:38.730 --> 13:41.598
I mean,
my daughter had gone missing.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.633
My ex-husband was dead.

13:43.635 --> 13:46.236
<i> You can understand,</i>
<i> I was a little wary</i>

13:46.238 --> 13:47.571
<i> of strangers.</i>

13:47.573 --> 13:49.439
Called? By who?

13:49.441 --> 13:50.640
By<i> whom.</i>

13:51.643 --> 13:53.143
Uh, sorry.

13:53.145 --> 13:56.580
I always assume
that my reputation arrives

13:56.582 --> 13:58.815
before I do.

13:58.817 --> 14:02.085
It's been said by many
that my ego certainly does.

14:03.455 --> 14:04.788
I don't mean "called"

14:04.790 --> 14:06.756
in any way
you'd be familiar with,

14:06.758 --> 14:09.526
via AT&T, or Sprint...

14:09.528 --> 14:12.195
(chuckling):
...if you're
particularly gauche.

14:12.197 --> 14:13.663
I was sittin' in my home

14:13.665 --> 14:15.465
in the uptown district
of New Orleans,

14:15.467 --> 14:18.535
having a Café Du Monde beignet.

14:20.038 --> 14:21.605
Watching the CNN

14:21.607 --> 14:24.474
about your missing angel.

14:24.476 --> 14:27.477
And a spirit

14:27.479 --> 14:29.312
whispered in my ear

14:29.314 --> 14:33.116
that the mystery
to this abduction

14:33.118 --> 14:34.651
is only gonna be untangled

14:34.653 --> 14:36.486
by a man who knows

14:36.488 --> 14:39.322
the comings and goings
of the other side.

14:39.324 --> 14:42.492
We appreciate you coming,
but we're gonna let the FBI

14:42.494 --> 14:43.560
take it from here.

14:43.562 --> 14:45.395
Who has been assigned the case?

14:45.397 --> 14:47.564
Is it Special Agent Greenfield?

14:47.566 --> 14:48.865
He would be
my choice.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.500
I worked with him
on an abduction

14:50.502 --> 14:52.702
of a child
in the southern Utah desert.

14:52.704 --> 14:54.538
Must be five years gone by now.

14:54.540 --> 14:55.639
We found him.

14:55.641 --> 14:57.240
Alive and well.

14:57.242 --> 14:58.542
SHELBY:
<i> He was right.</i>

14:58.544 --> 15:00.310
We looked him up.

15:00.312 --> 15:01.811
There were pictures of him

15:01.813 --> 15:04.714
with the southern regional
director of the FBI.

15:04.716 --> 15:07.484
Stories about him
helping to find...

15:07.486 --> 15:10.387
missing children
all over the country.

15:12.524 --> 15:15.158
Gift came to me
when I was nine years old.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.894
My nana couldn't find
her car keys anywhere.

15:17.896 --> 15:19.329
I told her

15:19.331 --> 15:20.730
she had accidentally
tossed 'em out

15:20.732 --> 15:22.599
with a takeout
food container.

15:24.269 --> 15:25.569
(clicking tongue)

15:25.571 --> 15:26.870
(bangs cane loudly)

15:26.872 --> 15:28.138
(clicking tongue)

15:29.174 --> 15:30.440
(bangs cane loudly)

15:30.442 --> 15:33.543
The news stories about him
were compelling.

15:33.545 --> 15:36.680
But come on... psychics?

15:36.682 --> 15:38.715
I was skeptical.

15:38.717 --> 15:40.717
<i> But then he did something</i>
<i> I could not explain.</i>

15:40.719 --> 15:42.786
(bangs cane loudly)

15:44.556 --> 15:46.556
(breathing shakily)

15:46.558 --> 15:48.758
Shh!

15:52.297 --> 15:53.863
(very faint childish laughter)

15:53.865 --> 15:55.799
Can... can you hear that?

16:03.308 --> 16:05.442
She was here.

16:07.746 --> 16:09.813
Hiding...

16:17.789 --> 16:18.955
(hinges creak)

16:26.898 --> 16:28.965
(breathing shakily)

16:30.602 --> 16:33.003
Flora is not dead.

16:34.606 --> 16:36.973
And she wasn't taken
by the living.

16:40.145 --> 16:42.078
Your daughter is with Priscilla.

16:43.615 --> 16:45.782
Priscilla?

16:45.784 --> 16:47.684
Who-who is Priscilla?

16:47.686 --> 16:49.252
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:49.254 --> 16:50.587
That... that's not possible.

16:50.589 --> 16:51.621
Priscilla isn't real.

16:51.623 --> 16:53.490
Priscilla is real.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.826
She's a child.

16:58.630 --> 17:01.998
She has a fondness
for corn husk dolls.

17:03.769 --> 17:06.436
She died in the late 1500s.

17:06.438 --> 17:10.006
I believed Cricket had
some kind of sight.

17:10.008 --> 17:12.676
There are people with the gift.

17:12.678 --> 17:14.177
Touched.

17:14.179 --> 17:16.613
Matt thinks I'm too gullible.

17:16.615 --> 17:18.782
I've read about these psychics.

17:18.784 --> 17:20.984
It all seems like magic,

17:20.986 --> 17:23.486
but they are just
really good at the con.

17:23.488 --> 17:25.622
They target people
who are the most desperate

17:25.624 --> 17:26.856
and they find their way in.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.692
M-Maybe he talked to Mason

17:28.694 --> 17:30.360
or someone he knew.

17:30.362 --> 17:32.796
I just had a feeling

17:32.798 --> 17:34.664
that Cricket could help.

17:34.666 --> 17:37.667
So, when he told me
that he needed permission

17:37.669 --> 17:39.302
from the owners of the house

17:39.304 --> 17:42.072
to try a communication
with the spirit world,

17:42.074 --> 17:44.240
I gave it to him.

17:44.242 --> 17:47.677
Spirits of the north,
south, east, west,

17:47.679 --> 17:50.513
Father Sky, Mother Earth,

17:50.515 --> 17:53.083
hear our call.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.325
(exhales)

18:05.697 --> 18:08.264
Gods of this earth and the next,

18:08.266 --> 18:10.900
show us what is hidden.

18:11.903 --> 18:14.104
Priscilla?

18:14.106 --> 18:16.539
Sweet Priscilla.

18:16.541 --> 18:18.708
Come speak to us.

18:18.710 --> 18:21.678
We mean you no harm.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.812
(Shelby gasps)

18:24.716 --> 18:27.417
Is it her?

18:27.419 --> 18:29.886
Is it Priscilla?
No.

18:29.888 --> 18:31.454
It's another.

18:31.456 --> 18:33.356
A woman.

18:33.358 --> 18:35.425
Horrible woman.
Quick, join hands.

18:35.427 --> 18:36.926
What?
Just join hands!

18:36.928 --> 18:38.895
You'll need your
combined strength

18:38.897 --> 18:40.730
to keep yourselves safe.

18:40.732 --> 18:41.865
Who are you?

18:41.867 --> 18:43.233
Why have you
taken the child?

18:43.235 --> 18:45.368
WOMAN'S VOICE:
I am called The Butcher,

18:45.370 --> 18:47.737
and all that invade
and threaten my land

18:47.739 --> 18:49.439
do me harm.

18:49.441 --> 18:51.641
Show your face, dark woman.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.756
This is the prayer card

19:06.758 --> 19:08.324
of Saint John Gualbert.

19:08.326 --> 19:10.126
He's the saint of mercy,

19:10.128 --> 19:14.330
the patron saint of those who
work and live in the forest.

19:14.332 --> 19:17.967
I ask him to surround us
in his white light.

19:17.969 --> 19:20.236
You can do us no harm.

19:24.509 --> 19:25.975
(all gasp)

19:28.814 --> 19:31.281
LEE:
<i> This was all getting too real.</i>

19:31.283 --> 19:33.983
I mean, you could explain away
knowing about the hiding place

19:33.985 --> 19:35.919
and the corn husk doll,

19:35.921 --> 19:37.353
but I was in that room.

19:37.355 --> 19:38.988
<i> There were no wires,</i>
<i> no special effects.</i>

19:38.990 --> 19:41.090
<i> The candle split on its own,</i>

19:41.092 --> 19:43.593
perfectly,
right down the middle.

19:43.595 --> 19:45.195
I couldn't explain it.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.699
I couldn't explain it.

19:49.701 --> 19:51.801
I surround us with
the white light of protection.
(Shelby gasping)

19:51.803 --> 19:53.970
I surround us with the white
light of protection.

19:53.972 --> 19:55.872
You cannot harm us!

19:57.008 --> 19:59.142
She has a cleaver.

19:59.144 --> 20:01.110
She's called The Butcher.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.980
She passed over
a long time ago, centuries.

20:03.982 --> 20:05.982
Why do you haunt this place?

20:05.984 --> 20:08.017
THE BUTCHER:
I protect this place.

20:08.019 --> 20:09.953
This place is mine.

20:09.955 --> 20:10.987
Ours.

20:10.989 --> 20:12.989
I shall stop at nothing

20:12.991 --> 20:15.658
to hold safe this colony.

20:15.660 --> 20:18.828
I shall stack the bodies
high as cordwood.

20:18.830 --> 20:19.829
LEE:
Does she know
where Flora is?

20:19.831 --> 20:21.397
CRICKET:
Where's the child?

20:21.399 --> 20:22.832
Why have you taken her?

20:22.834 --> 20:24.834
(chuckling)

20:24.836 --> 20:26.836
Had I that child,

20:26.838 --> 20:29.906
she would've been flayed
and roasted by now.

20:30.842 --> 20:33.743
Priscilla, the bastard's seed,

20:33.745 --> 20:35.178
hath hidden her away

20:35.180 --> 20:38.648
somewhere beyond
our hallowed ground.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.917
I shall not step
one foot off my land.

20:40.919 --> 20:43.052
Never again.

20:43.054 --> 20:46.823
I must protect it
from trespassers such as thee.

20:48.894 --> 20:50.860
Oh, honey,

20:50.862 --> 20:54.497
this land does not belong
to the dead.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.367
You're the trespasser!

20:57.369 --> 21:00.570
(glass shattering,
all screaming)

21:02.073 --> 21:04.140
Croatoan!

21:05.510 --> 21:07.644
(echoes):
Croatoan!

21:19.090 --> 21:20.890
"Croatoan."

21:20.892 --> 21:23.059
The same word
those wild boys uttered.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.394
CRICKET:
<i> Croatoan!</i>

21:24.396 --> 21:25.595
What the hell was that?!

21:25.597 --> 21:26.796
Where's Flora at?

21:26.798 --> 21:28.097
What did they say?

21:28.099 --> 21:29.198
That word
that you said...

21:29.200 --> 21:30.466
Is she afraid?

21:30.468 --> 21:32.035
Is she all right?

21:32.037 --> 21:34.237
"Croatoan."

21:34.239 --> 21:35.738
What does it mean?

21:35.740 --> 21:38.308
Rest your pretty little heads.

21:38.310 --> 21:40.310
Cricket has
all the answers you seek.

21:40.312 --> 21:43.279
The spirits are dark
and malevolent,

21:43.281 --> 21:45.548
and they do indeed
have your daughter.

21:47.085 --> 21:49.285
But...

21:49.287 --> 21:51.621
I can take you to her.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.125
$25,000.

21:56.127 --> 21:58.928
I take Visa,
MasterCard, Discover...

21:58.930 --> 22:00.763
MATT:
You damn con artist.

22:00.765 --> 22:01.931
What kind of twisted

22:01.933 --> 22:04.901
low-life preys on
a mother's hopes?

22:04.903 --> 22:06.102
You got the gall
to ask for money

22:06.104 --> 22:07.437
after you break out
my damn windows?

22:07.439 --> 22:08.972
Hey, Matt!
Huh?!

22:08.974 --> 22:10.740
Matt! He didn't have
anything to do with that.

22:10.742 --> 22:12.675
How could he?
We were with him
the whole time.

22:12.677 --> 22:13.977
MATT:
<i> This crook</i>

22:13.979 --> 22:15.244
could've had someone outside

22:15.246 --> 22:17.947
with a BB gun, shooting on cue.

22:17.949 --> 22:19.749
This whole damn thing

22:19.751 --> 22:21.284
was a Cirque du Soleil
bullshit act

22:21.286 --> 22:23.086
to shake us down,

22:23.088 --> 22:25.021
and I wasn't gonna let him
get away with it.

22:26.658 --> 22:30.326
I can see how it's easier
to believe that.

22:30.328 --> 22:32.495
How can your
conventional mind

22:32.497 --> 22:34.597
explain away things
that you've seen?

22:34.599 --> 22:36.165
Things you cannot
be processed

22:36.167 --> 22:38.501
with terrestrial thinking.

22:38.503 --> 22:40.370
But my gift is real.

22:40.372 --> 22:42.705
I tell the truth.

22:42.707 --> 22:44.674
Even the FBI pays.

22:44.676 --> 22:46.809
You are an awful
human being.

22:46.811 --> 22:50.246
I perform a service.

22:52.951 --> 22:54.984
I plunge my delicate soul
into peril

22:54.986 --> 22:58.121
every time a crying mama
comes to me

22:58.123 --> 23:01.157
about her missing chickadee.

23:01.159 --> 23:03.159
My desire is to help.

23:03.161 --> 23:06.496
I didn't give a shit if Cricket
was a psychic or a psycho.

23:06.498 --> 23:09.165
I was done playing games.

23:09.167 --> 23:12.802
It was time for him
to tell us everything he knew.

23:12.804 --> 23:14.637
You can understand
my predicament.

23:14.639 --> 23:17.173
When you're peddling
pharmaceuticals, do you give 'em

23:17.175 --> 23:18.908
to all the dying children
for free?

23:18.910 --> 23:20.209
(gun cocks)

23:20.211 --> 23:22.078
LEE:
<i> Time for some answers.</i>

23:22.080 --> 23:24.380
(shuddered breathing)

23:24.382 --> 23:26.582
(whispers):
Lee...

23:26.584 --> 23:28.851
Hey, put the gun down.

23:28.853 --> 23:32.021
He knows where Flora is.
He's a fraud.

23:32.023 --> 23:33.990
He's just messing
with your head, Lee.

23:33.992 --> 23:36.025
Come on.

23:36.027 --> 23:39.028
Come on, Lee.

23:39.030 --> 23:42.198
I'm sorry.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.299
(scoffs)
I'm sorry.

23:49.774 --> 23:53.109
(gun uncocks)

23:53.111 --> 23:55.611
(sighs)

23:55.613 --> 23:57.213
(chair clatters on floor)

23:57.215 --> 24:00.216
Get the hell out of my
house, you piece of shit.

24:00.218 --> 24:05.388
(chuckling):
Oh...

24:05.390 --> 24:09.025
Missy.

24:09.027 --> 24:11.294
I will be back.

24:14.032 --> 24:16.866
You will invite me.

24:21.039 --> 24:22.638
(whispering indistinctly)

24:23.775 --> 24:25.074
Hey.

24:25.076 --> 24:26.142
...all those many years ago.

24:26.144 --> 24:29.078
Hey.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.279
PRODUCER:
What did he say to her?

24:30.281 --> 24:32.115
Cricket?

24:32.117 --> 24:33.916
I don't know.

24:33.918 --> 24:36.719
Something about Flora,
I suppose.

24:36.721 --> 24:39.255
<i> But it shook her up,</i>

24:39.257 --> 24:40.423
<i> I could see that.</i>

24:40.425 --> 24:42.058
LEE:
<i> Well, we were all shook up.</i>

24:42.060 --> 24:43.793
PRODUCER:
Your sister-in-law thought

24:43.795 --> 24:45.595
it was something Cricket Marlowe
whispered to you

24:45.597 --> 24:47.096
before he left.

24:47.098 --> 24:49.465
I don't remember
anything like that.
You sure?

24:49.467 --> 24:52.268
Because you went to see him
the next day.

24:52.270 --> 24:53.803
Was that because Cricket Marlowe

24:53.805 --> 24:56.506
said something
about your first daughter?

24:56.508 --> 24:59.142
About Emily?

25:00.812 --> 25:02.678
(whispers):
Emily says hello.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.181
She wonders why you quit looking
for her all those years ago.

25:05.183 --> 25:07.750
Hey.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.421
How do you know about Emily?

25:12.423 --> 25:14.023
PRODUCER:
All participants on the show

25:14.025 --> 25:16.325
are subjected to extensive
background checks.

25:16.327 --> 25:19.962
Death certificates
are a matter of public record.

25:19.964 --> 25:22.298
Tell us about Emily.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.934
We need to stop.

25:24.936 --> 25:28.504
You need to turn off
those cameras.

25:28.506 --> 25:31.107
I said turn off
those goddamn cameras!

25:31.976 --> 25:33.476
(camera beeps)

25:33.478 --> 25:36.345
The red light's on.

25:36.347 --> 25:40.516
Are we rolling again?

25:40.518 --> 25:42.351
(sighs)

25:42.353 --> 25:45.121
I was young.

25:45.123 --> 25:47.390
17 when I had Emily.

25:49.494 --> 25:51.460
She had just turned four.

25:51.462 --> 25:54.130
It was around
the Fourth of July.

25:54.132 --> 25:56.232
I was running errands

25:56.234 --> 25:59.001
and just had to run
to the grocery store

25:59.003 --> 26:01.304
and grab some sauce real fast.

26:01.306 --> 26:03.873
Five minutes.

26:05.677 --> 26:08.077
I don't know why
I didn't take her in with me.

26:11.883 --> 26:14.684
When I came back to the car,
she was gone.

26:14.686 --> 26:17.253
I never saw her again.

26:20.325 --> 26:23.226
I know how this looks.

26:23.228 --> 26:26.495
I had absolutely nothing to do
with Flora's disappearance

26:26.497 --> 26:28.564
from the house.

26:28.566 --> 26:31.734
If I had, why the hell would
I pay a psychic $25,000

26:31.736 --> 26:33.336
to get her back?

26:33.338 --> 26:35.504
I'm didn't come here for
any more parlor tricks.

26:35.506 --> 26:38.241
You have your money now.

26:38.243 --> 26:42.278
Tell me where Priscilla
has my daughter.

26:44.015 --> 26:46.716
I wish it were that simple.

26:46.718 --> 26:50.119
<i> After I was asked</i>
<i> to leave your house,</i>

26:50.121 --> 26:52.221
<i> I took a stroll</i>
<i> in the surrounding woods.</i>

26:52.223 --> 26:56.359
<i> That's when my mind</i>
<i> was blasted. </i>
(indistinct voices)

26:56.361 --> 26:59.195
The spirits downloaded to me
like a paranormal zip drive.

26:59.197 --> 27:01.631
<i> The only way</i>

27:01.633 --> 27:05.401
to save your baby
is to find out everything we can

27:05.403 --> 27:08.304
about the enemy.

27:08.306 --> 27:10.273
The Butcher.

27:10.275 --> 27:12.141
Her Christian name
was Thomasin White.

27:12.143 --> 27:14.143
Her husband John
was the governor

27:14.145 --> 27:16.245
of the colony of Roanoke.

27:16.247 --> 27:17.313
<i> Life was harsh</i>
<i> for the settlers,</i>

27:17.315 --> 27:19.148
<i> and John was persuaded</i>

27:19.150 --> 27:21.817
<i> to travel back to England</i>
<i> for more supplies.</i>

27:21.819 --> 27:24.086
<i> He left Thomasin in charge</i>

27:24.088 --> 27:26.389
<i> until he returned.</i>

27:30.395 --> 27:34.096
This thin gruel will not quiet
our bellies, we need real food.

27:34.098 --> 27:36.799
Be grateful for what thou art
given, Mr. Cage.

27:36.801 --> 27:39.302
The women receive
only half share.

27:39.304 --> 27:41.337
Mother, the people are starving.

27:41.339 --> 27:44.240
And winter is almost upon us.

27:44.242 --> 27:45.641
We must venture inland
if we are to survive.

27:45.643 --> 27:47.843
Sir, we agreed, such a perilous
course of action

27:47.845 --> 27:50.446
requires much prayer
and careful consideration.

27:50.448 --> 27:52.014
There is nothing to consider.

27:52.016 --> 27:53.683
We stay where my husband
left us.

27:53.685 --> 27:56.485
Until his return,
I shall hear no more from thee.

27:59.791 --> 28:01.257
LEE:<i> Everybody who lives</i>
<i> in North Carolina</i>

28:01.259 --> 28:04.327
knows the history
of the Lost Colony.

28:04.329 --> 28:08.197
It's a ghost story people told
around the campfire.

28:08.199 --> 28:13.469
116 settlers disappeared
without a trace.

28:13.471 --> 28:19.141
No bodies, not a single thing
was ever found.

28:19.143 --> 28:22.378
But Roanoke
has nothing to do with us.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.313
<i> With my Flora.</i>

28:24.315 --> 28:27.316
You think I'm selling you
a crock of shit.

28:27.318 --> 28:29.618
You read my mind.
And you're wasting my time.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.022
Now, everyone knows that
Roanoke is nowhere near here.

28:33.024 --> 28:35.958
There's a historical
monument over an hour away.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.894
And we've heard that story
ever since we were kids.

28:38.896 --> 28:42.932
You only think
you know the story.

29:04.489 --> 29:07.356
THOMASIN (echoes):
<i> No! </i>
(metal clanking)

29:07.358 --> 29:10.760
Pestilence requires a firm hand.

29:10.762 --> 29:14.997
A leader shall lead only with
the consent of the governed.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.400
By all true reckoning, thou
hath lost our allegiance.

29:17.402 --> 29:19.535
Thou art hereby removed

29:19.537 --> 29:21.570
from thy position and banished

29:21.572 --> 29:22.671
from our protection.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.573
Traitor!

29:24.575 --> 29:27.710
Thou shalt hang.

29:27.712 --> 29:30.212
I shall live.

29:30.214 --> 29:32.648
As we all shall when
we travel inland.

29:34.218 --> 29:36.652
Please, she will not survive.

29:39.090 --> 29:41.290
Let God's will be done.

29:45.396 --> 29:47.530
I put this on thee,
not for spite,

29:47.532 --> 29:50.299
but for justice.

29:50.301 --> 29:52.802
Thou shalt find it as hard to
live with this around thy neck

29:52.804 --> 29:55.171
as it was for us
with thee around ours.

29:59.811 --> 30:02.611
Pledge fealty to our cause.

30:02.613 --> 30:04.480
Thy loyalty must be absolute.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.517
I cannot.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.221
CAGE:
Her fate is sealed.

30:15.827 --> 30:18.461
Thine own fate
hangeth in the balance.

30:36.347 --> 30:38.714
Beg for a reprieve, Mother.

30:39.984 --> 30:42.718
I bend my knee to no man.

30:56.534 --> 30:57.900
God have mercy.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.647
CRICKET:
<i> She was abandoned.</i>

31:11.649 --> 31:14.383
In the forest for days.

31:15.686 --> 31:19.555
<i> She was dying</i>
<i> of hunger and thirst.</i>

31:29.634 --> 31:35.004
(groans and pants softly)

31:35.006 --> 31:37.573
(insects chirping)

31:41.012 --> 31:44.613
(pig squealing,
Thomasin yells and whimpers)

31:51.689 --> 31:53.155
(Thomasin grunting)

31:59.697 --> 32:01.597
CRICKET:
<i> Thomasin had lost all hope.</i>

32:01.599 --> 32:03.365
<i> All she had left</i>
<i> were her prayers.</i>

32:03.367 --> 32:05.067
(panting):
I repent...

32:05.069 --> 32:07.736
I repent,

32:07.738 --> 32:10.706
for the kingdom
of heaven is nigh.

32:10.708 --> 32:13.542
My Lord,

32:13.544 --> 32:14.877
if I'm to be torn apart

32:14.879 --> 32:17.513
by wild beasts, it is thy will.
(galloping hoofbeats)

32:17.515 --> 32:20.449
I surrender my soul...

32:20.451 --> 32:22.184
(galloping hoofbeats)
for thy safe keeping.

32:23.387 --> 32:25.454
(pig screeching in pain,
stabbing sounds)

32:25.456 --> 32:29.191
(screeching stops,
Thomasin whimpers)

32:29.193 --> 32:32.828
(slashing and squishing sounds)

32:49.747 --> 32:53.582
(panting):
<i>Serve.</i>

32:53.584 --> 32:54.950
(heart beating)

33:02.593 --> 33:05.761
(echoing):
<i> Eat.</i>

33:05.763 --> 33:09.965
<i> Surrender thy soul...</i>

33:09.967 --> 33:12.868
<i> to me.</i>

33:17.308 --> 33:21.744
(heart continues beating)

33:21.746 --> 33:23.846
(chains rattle)

33:39.797 --> 33:41.263
CAGE:
So we all agree, then.

33:41.265 --> 33:42.831
Take the trail inland.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.367
There's a clearing by the river
where we can all settle.

33:45.369 --> 33:47.436
(men whispering, murmuring)

33:48.806 --> 33:50.906
Ah!

33:58.182 --> 34:00.049
I have been purified

34:00.051 --> 34:02.151
by my torment in the wilderness.

34:02.153 --> 34:04.653
Let no man mistake God's will.

34:04.655 --> 34:06.155
The mistake was returning here.

34:06.157 --> 34:07.656
(gasps)

34:07.658 --> 34:09.058
(choking)

34:26.210 --> 34:28.777
Beg for a reprieve, Ambrose.

34:30.081 --> 34:31.647
Mother...

34:31.649 --> 34:33.782
have mercy.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.722
Were thou not birthed
of mine own treacherous flesh,

34:39.724 --> 34:41.890
I would cut
thy throat

34:41.892 --> 34:44.426
and hurl thee
into bloody damnation.

34:44.428 --> 34:47.596
Do not defy me again.

34:53.037 --> 34:54.403
So we stay.

34:56.340 --> 34:57.673
No.

34:57.675 --> 34:59.074
We go inland.

34:59.076 --> 35:01.910
The colony moved here?

35:01.912 --> 35:04.246
That's how your paths
crossed with The Butcher.

35:04.248 --> 35:05.848
She claims dominion,

35:05.850 --> 35:09.918
and for this land
she will kill you all.

35:23.567 --> 35:25.634
(owl hooting)

35:29.907 --> 35:31.540
Are you sure we
should be out here?

35:31.542 --> 35:34.376
We just have to trust
him now, Shelby.

35:34.378 --> 35:36.378
May I have the bonnet, please?

35:36.380 --> 35:37.780
LEE:
Yes.

35:41.752 --> 35:43.585
(whistles quietly)

35:43.587 --> 35:44.887
Priscilla?

35:46.290 --> 35:48.290
Show yourself, precious.

35:48.292 --> 35:50.192
Don't be afraid.

35:51.462 --> 35:53.529
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

35:54.665 --> 35:56.932
We're not alone here, chickens.

35:56.934 --> 35:58.901
LEE:
Oh, I feel heat.

35:58.903 --> 36:00.169
(Cricket chuckles darkly)

36:00.171 --> 36:03.772
The Butcher
and some of her muscle.

36:03.774 --> 36:05.808
THOMASIN:
Behold.

36:05.810 --> 36:08.844
The defilers present themselves
for slaughter.

36:08.846 --> 36:11.313
Harm us,

36:11.315 --> 36:13.782
and only more will follow.

36:13.784 --> 36:15.784
And you will
never have

36:15.786 --> 36:17.753
the peace that you seek.

36:17.755 --> 36:20.088
But there's a way
that we can all get

36:20.090 --> 36:22.357
what we want.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.428
I will attend.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.863
Speak.

36:27.865 --> 36:30.432
Bring us the mortal girl.

36:30.434 --> 36:32.434
Compel Priscilla

36:32.436 --> 36:34.970
to give up her playmate.

36:34.972 --> 36:36.772
Help her understand

36:36.774 --> 36:38.807
there can be no friendship
between the dead

36:38.809 --> 36:40.843
and the living.

36:40.845 --> 36:44.780
As soon as Flora
is safe with us,

36:44.782 --> 36:46.615
my clients will be gone!

36:46.617 --> 36:48.717
Bag and baggage!
LEE:
And we'll make sure

36:48.719 --> 36:50.819
that no one else
comes here again.

36:50.821 --> 36:51.987
We'll burn
the house down.

36:51.989 --> 36:53.522
SHELBY:
We never agreed to that!

36:53.524 --> 36:55.324
Flora's everything
that I have!

36:55.326 --> 36:57.226
She's my daughter.
You wouldn't understand!

36:57.228 --> 36:59.394
And we did
agree to it.

36:59.396 --> 37:01.897
Who agreed to it?
Matt agreed to it.

37:04.201 --> 37:05.901
Where is he?

37:07.238 --> 37:09.972
SHELBY:
Matt? Matt?

37:09.974 --> 37:12.808
SHELBY:<i> I wasn't surprised</i>
<i> that Lee went back to Cricket.</i>

37:12.810 --> 37:14.276
<i> Or even that she wrote him</i>
<i> a big check.</i>

37:15.546 --> 37:17.479
She was desperate.

37:17.481 --> 37:19.081
We all were.

37:21.051 --> 37:22.851
What surprised me

37:22.853 --> 37:24.386
<i> was Matt.</i>

37:24.388 --> 37:27.656
I still have no memory
of slipping away.

37:27.658 --> 37:30.826
And I...

37:30.828 --> 37:32.995
I certainly have no memory

37:32.997 --> 37:35.063
of what Shelby says she saw
when she found me.

37:35.065 --> 37:36.865
SHELBY:
Matt?

37:36.867 --> 37:39.268
LEE (calling in distance):
Matt!

37:39.270 --> 37:41.403
(insects trilling)

37:41.405 --> 37:43.939
(rustling)

37:49.880 --> 37:51.947
(man panting)

37:52.883 --> 37:54.283
(man moans)

37:57.087 --> 37:59.388
(woman gasps in pleasure)

37:59.390 --> 38:01.123
(woman gasping, man grunting)

38:25.916 --> 38:29.217
Cricket assured me The Butcher
had agreed to the deal.

38:29.219 --> 38:32.054
But now both Matt
and Shelby were gone.

38:32.056 --> 38:34.656
We looked for them
for what seemed like an hour.

38:34.658 --> 38:36.558
Matt finally emerged, confused.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.661
He had no idea
where he had been. And Shelby...

38:39.663 --> 38:41.563
<i> well, apparently, she had gone</i>
<i> back to the house on her own.</i>

38:41.565 --> 38:43.765
Shelby!

38:43.767 --> 38:45.300
Oh.

38:45.302 --> 38:46.902
Oh, thank God.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.136
Thank God, I thought
you were hurt.
Hey.

38:48.138 --> 38:49.671
What?
Don't touch me.

38:49.673 --> 38:51.139
Whoa. What? What?

38:51.141 --> 38:52.774
What are you talking about?
What's wrong?

38:52.776 --> 38:53.642
What's wrong?

38:53.644 --> 38:55.110
Are you kidding me?

38:55.112 --> 38:56.678
You went behind my back

38:56.680 --> 38:58.981
and agreed to burn
our house down.

38:58.983 --> 39:01.083
Oh...
You were out
in the woods

39:01.085 --> 39:03.452
having sex
with that woman.

39:03.454 --> 39:05.487
Who is she, Matt?

39:05.489 --> 39:06.989
Who is she?

39:06.991 --> 39:08.323
What woman?

39:09.960 --> 39:13.128
Don't you dare
try to gaslight me.

39:13.130 --> 39:14.763
I saw you with her,

39:14.765 --> 39:16.932
screwing her up
against this tree

39:16.934 --> 39:18.767
while those hillbillies watched.

39:18.769 --> 39:20.769
It was disgusting.
(sniffles)

39:20.771 --> 39:22.871
Shelby, I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:22.873 --> 39:24.039
LEE:
Matt!

39:24.041 --> 39:24.973
Cuff her.

39:24.975 --> 39:26.808
Lee.

39:26.810 --> 39:28.143
Hey. Hey!
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:28.145 --> 39:29.611
Anything you say
can and will

39:29.613 --> 39:31.980
be used against you
in a court of law.
Matt?

39:31.982 --> 39:33.949
You have a right to an attorney.
Put her in the car.

39:33.951 --> 39:35.183
LEE: Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait!

39:35.185 --> 39:37.285
What did you do?
LEE:
Get off me.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.553
Let...
I don't know

39:38.555 --> 39:40.288
what you're talking about.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.724
I'll meet you
at the station.

39:42.726 --> 39:44.693
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:45.963 --> 39:47.462
(engine starts)
