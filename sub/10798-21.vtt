Captain's log, stardate 42923.4.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.632
Despite misgivings, l have agreed
to Starfleet's request

00:08.842 --> 00:11.343
that the Enterprise divert
to the Braslota system

00:11.553 --> 00:14.138
to take part in a war game exercise.

00:14.347 --> 00:17.016
Joining us
as observer and mediator

00:17.225 --> 00:22.271
is the Zakdorn master strategist,
Sirna Kolrami.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.576
Mr. Kolrami, Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Welcome aboard.

00:35.785 --> 00:39.496
Captain, l bring you greetings
from those at Starfleet Command.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.707
Would you care to be shown
to your quarters?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.751
l require little rest, captain.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.212

with our mission.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.721
Despite their reputations,

00:55.930 --> 01:00.934
this Zakdorn does not appear to be
a very formidable warrior.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.854
ln the game
of military brinksmanship,

01:04.064 --> 01:06.398
individual physical prowess
is less important

01:06.608 --> 01:09.276
than the perception
of a species as a whole.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.072
For over nine millennia, potential foes
have regarded the Zakdorns

01:13.281 --> 01:16.533
as having the greatest
innately strategic minds in the galaxy.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.829
So no one is willing to test
that perception in combat.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.915
Exactly.

He is still your first choice?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.685
Commander Riker
will captain the Hathaway.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.814
You will have 48 hours
to ready your vessel

01:47.023 --> 01:48.315
before the Enterprise attacks.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.317
And we'll experience
actual battle conditions?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.735
Correct.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.696
Engineering will disconnect
the Enterprise's weapons

01:54.948 --> 01:58.325
and link the system
with the modified laser-pulse beam.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.744
All hits
will be recorded electronically.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.998
lf the computer registers damage,
it will act accordingly,

02:05.208 --> 02:09.044
shutting down the affected areas
for the appropriate repair time.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.762
Captain Picard,
it is my understanding

02:18.972 --> 02:22.975
that you initially resisted
Starfleet's request for this simulation.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.893
Yes.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.271
Well, may l know why?

02:27.480 --> 02:31.358
Starfleet is not a military organization.
lts purpose is exploration.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.903
Then why am l here?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.823
With the Borg threat,

02:38.032 --> 02:43.412
l decided that my officers and l
needed to hone our tactical skills.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.080
ln a crisis situation,

02:45.248 --> 02:49.209

But that does not alter your duty
to me and to this ship.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.601
Now, do you know
how to formulate a premise?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.103
- Yes, sir.
- Then formulate this one.

29:33.313 --> 29:36.023
How do l deal with Commander Riker
and the Hathaway?

29:36.232 --> 29:39.276
l'll await your answer on the Bridge.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.112
And commander?

29:43.072 --> 29:47.993
lt is possible to commit no mistakes
and still lose.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.163
That is not a weakness.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.332
That is life.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.961
l believe l understand, sir.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.423
And, Data, will you leave
your hesitation and self-doubt

30:01.633 --> 30:03.634
here in your quarters.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.599
[BEEPlNG]

30:16.189 --> 30:20.359
l have several examples of
Commander Riker's battle technique.

30:20.568 --> 30:24.029
At the academy,
he calculated a sensory blind spot

30:24.239 --> 30:28.075
on a Tholian vessel and hid within it
during a battle simulation.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.869
And as a lieutenant
aboard the Potemkin,

30:31.079 --> 30:34.248
his solution to a crisis
was to shut down all power

30:34.457 --> 30:37.000
and hang over
a planet's magnetic poles,

30:37.210 --> 30:39.378
thus confusing
his opponent's sensors.

30:39.963 --> 30:45.133
And from these specifics, what general
conclusion can you extrapolate?

30:45.510 --> 30:49.346
Only 21 percent of the time
does he rely on traditional tactics.

30:49.556 --> 30:55.477
So the captain must be prepared
for unusual cunning.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.355
Counselor.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.316
Commander Riker will assume
we have made this analysis,

31:01.526 --> 31:05.153
and knowing that we know
his methods, he will alter them.

31:05.613 --> 31:09.199
But knowing that he knows
that we know that he knows,

31:09.409 --> 31:11.577
he might choose to return
to his usual pattern.

31:11.786 --> 31:16.290
Wait, wait.
You're over-analyzing, Data.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.918
One cannot deny human nature.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.588
What kind of a man
is Commander Riker?

31:25.258 --> 31:27.718
- A fighter?
- Yes.

31:28.636 --> 31:29.928
The weaker his position,

31:30.138 --> 31:32.222
the more aggressive will be
his posture.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.308
And he won't give up.

31:35.310 --> 31:39.855
Then despite whatever options
he is given, he must be--

31:40.064 --> 31:44.359
- The man that he is. Exactly.
- Hm.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.154
ls that a failing in humans?

for yourself.

with such a recognizable ploy?

our tactics on his terms.

Right now l have to work

to capture the Hathaway,

38:44.447 --> 38:46.072

Therefore, we must remove the ship
from their field of interest.

lnitiate recovery procedures.
Continue repairs.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.961
Plot a course
for the nearest starbase.

42:31.590 --> 42:32.966
PlCARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.

42:33.175 --> 42:36.594
With the transporter repaired
and my crew safely back aboard,

42:36.804 --> 42:41.558
we have officially ended
our first Starfleet battle simulation.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.434
MAN 1 :
Come on, Data.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.272
WOMAN 1 : Push it, push it.
MAN 2: Don't lose it. Don't lose it.

42:47.481 --> 42:49.649
MAN 3: He's got him. Go, Data.
MAN 1 : You got him, you got him.

42:49.858 --> 42:50.900
WOMAN 2:
You can do it.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.111
- Come on, come on.
- Don't lose it. Don't lose it.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.862
- Come on, Data. You got him.
- Come on.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.282
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, Data.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.367
- Come on, Data. Come on.
- You can do it.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.537
- Come on, Data. Come on, Data.
- You can do it. Come on. Yes!

43:02.746 --> 43:05.582
- All right.
- Go, go, go!

43:05.791 --> 43:08.960
- You got him. Go get him.
- Come on, Data.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.429
Come on, Data. Come on.

43:24.476 --> 43:25.643
Argh!

43:26.979 --> 43:28.229
Why have you suspended
the game?

43:28.439 --> 43:30.648
Because this is not a rematch.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.526
You have made a mockery of me.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.197
Data, you beat him.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.241
No, sir. lt is a stalemate.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.702
WORF: No game of Strategema
has ever gone this high.

43:42.911 --> 43:43.995
LA FORGE:
What did you do?

43:44.204 --> 43:46.331
l simply altered my premise
for playing the game.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.582
RlKER:
Explain.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.793
Working under the assumption
that Kolrami was attempting to win,

43:51.003 --> 43:52.211
it is reasonable to assume

43:52.421 --> 43:54.547
that he expected me
to play for the same goal.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.965
You didn't.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.969
No. l was playing for a standoff.
A draw.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.180
While Kolrami was dedicated
to winning,

44:02.389 --> 44:05.099
l was able to pass up
obvious avenues of advancement

44:05.309 --> 44:06.976
and settle for a balance.

44:07.186 --> 44:10.396
Theoretically, l should be able
to challenge him indefinitely.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.899
- Then you have beaten him.
MAN 1 : Sure he has.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.734
lt is a matter of perspective, doctor.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.695
ln the strictest sense, l did not win.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.739
Data.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.826
- l busted him up.
ALL: Yes!

44:23.994 --> 44:25.870
[ALL LAUGHlNG]
