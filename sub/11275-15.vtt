    So, did you get a chance    
     to see Carla's babies?     

02:11.912 --> 02:12.962
Oh, we sure did.                

02:12.996 --> 02:15.164
There are two of the cutest     
little guys you've ever seen.   

02:15.198 --> 02:17.699
Ah, who do they look like,      
        Carla or Eddie?         

02:17.734 --> 02:18.334
            Well, they're twins.

02:18.368 --> 02:20.352
            They kind of look   
            like each other.    

02:22.656 --> 02:25.424
          What's this?          
        "Carla's Tips."         

02:25.458 --> 02:26.842
Yeah, it was Carla's idea.      

02:26.876 --> 02:29.178
She does some of her best       
    thinking in labor.          

02:29.212 --> 02:30.295
      This is ridiculous.       

02:30.329 --> 02:32.932
How does she expect to be tipped
    if she's not even here?     

02:32.966 --> 02:35.267
Well, actually,                 
she's doing a lot better        
than she usually does.          

02:36.937 --> 02:38.771
         Hello, Samuel.         
                            Hey.

02:38.805 --> 02:40.539
  Well, pardon my appearance,   
        everybody.              

02:40.573 --> 02:41.790
         We always do.          

02:42.426 --> 02:45.611
Sorry. I was covering for Carla.

02:45.645 --> 02:47.163
     Oh, hey, you're doing      
          a fine job.           

02:47.197 --> 02:49.415
The reason why I look like      
     I've been up all night     

02:49.449 --> 02:50.583
    is because, well,           
     I've been up all night     

02:50.617 --> 02:52.818
reading that little opus.       

02:52.853 --> 02:54.753
              All right,        
               <i>Lust for Justice.</i>

02:54.787 --> 02:56.288
            Yeah, Vera talked me
            into reading this.  

02:56.323 --> 02:57.456
Oh, is she a fan?               

02:57.490 --> 03:00.759
            No, no. When Vera's 
            talking, I'll read  
            just about anything.

03:00.793 --> 03:02.561
Yeah. I almost                  
ruptured a disc                 

03:02.596 --> 03:04.230
delivering those                
Book of the Month club copies   

03:04.264 --> 03:06.265
and I decided to see            
what all the hooha was about.   

03:06.299 --> 03:07.299
                Yeah, two thumbs
                up, right?      

03:07.334 --> 03:08.900
Oh, yeah.                       
Finest piece of trash

in modern literature.           

03:11.271 --> 03:15.040
    Good Lord. Another piece    
    of salacious mind candy.    

03:15.074 --> 03:18.176
    God, this is over           
        600 pages long.         

03:18.211 --> 03:20.412
    Who could imagine           
he'd know this many words?      

03:20.447 --> 03:22.732
     Yeah, well I checked.      
  He uses a lot of them twice.  

03:25.184 --> 03:26.418
            CLIFF:              
            Yeah, well, Frasier,

03:26.452 --> 03:27.219
you want to                     
borrow it then?                 

03:27.254 --> 03:29.238
     No way you'll find me      
          reading it.           

03:29.272 --> 03:30.906
  Just look at these reviews.   

03:30.940 --> 03:32.207
Suit yourself.

                         Cheers.

03:41.484 --> 03:44.787
        Oh, yeah, she is.       
        Miss Howe, Mr. Drake.   

03:44.821 --> 03:47.106
        Mr. Drake?              

03:47.108 --> 03:48.841
    I wonder what he's          
         calling about.         

03:48.875 --> 03:50.676
        Woody, how did he sound?

03:50.710 --> 03:53.145
 Happy, mad, pleasant, annoyed? 

03:53.179 --> 03:54.463
Well, he sounds                 

03:54.498 --> 03:55.464
         kind of weird.         

03:55.498 --> 03:57.632
 Like an old woman with a lisp  
and a thick German accent.      

03:57.667 --> 04:00.519
  Woody, that's his secretary.  

04:00.553 --> 04:02.821
Oh, well, then she sounded      
         pretty happy.          

04:06.809 --> 04:09.261
Hey, Anthony, Annie, what's up? 

04:09.296 --> 04:13.065
      Sam, I'm swallowing       
    my Tortelli pride           

04:13.099 --> 04:14.333
to ask if                       

04:14.368 --> 04:16.468
I might borrow five bucks.      

04:16.502 --> 04:18.536
That was very difficult         
for him.                        

04:18.571 --> 04:19.321
Is it okay?                     

04:19.355 --> 04:21.740
    I want to get a present     
for my mom and the twins.       

04:21.774 --> 04:22.842
                        Sure.   

04:22.876 --> 04:24.043
What are you going to get them? 

04:24.077 --> 04:25.127
          Five bucks.           

04:25.161 --> 04:27.779
    She'll like that.           

04:27.814 --> 04:28.747
              Thanks, Sam.      

04:28.782 --> 04:30.916
  Hey, I don't know when I'll be
  able to pay you back.         

04:30.950 --> 04:33.051
Job market's                    
been really bad lately.         

04:33.085 --> 04:35.921
          I haven't been able to
          find a job anywhere.  

04:35.955 --> 04:38.123
  Actually, we have an opening  
    for a temporary waitress    

04:38.157 --> 04:40.325
      to sub for your mom.      
    What do you think?          

04:40.360 --> 04:42.528
            Ah, I don't want    
            to be a waitress.   

04:42.562 --> 04:44.680
 No, I was thinking about her.  

04:44.714 --> 04:46.698
             No, I don't want my
             wife to work.      

04:46.733 --> 04:48.667
I could do it if I want to.     

04:48.702 --> 04:50.736
                      Nuh-uh.

                    Nuh-uh.     

04:53.340 --> 04:55.073
      W-Why don't you two       
         talk about it.         

04:55.107 --> 04:56.375
Of course we will.              

04:56.409 --> 04:59.211
Communication is                
the cornerstone of our marriage.

04:59.246 --> 05:01.914
                    Nuh-uh.     
Nuh-huh.                        

05:04.784 --> 05:07.219
    Well, well, well.           
          Hey, Normie,          

05:07.253 --> 05:08.821
look who's developed            
a lust for justice.             

05:08.855 --> 05:10.422
             Yeah.              

05:10.456 --> 05:12.624
        Do you mind?            
        Lorenzo is hemorrhaging.

05:12.658 --> 05:14.026
          Oh, he dies.          

05:14.060 --> 05:16.412
                  Don't tell me.
                  Don't tell me.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.613
    Yeah, yeah, that's true.    

05:17.647 --> 05:19.781
We don't want to spoil the part 
  where Monica first comes in.  

05:19.816 --> 05:21.884
Were you shocked or what when   
she turned out to be a man?     

05:21.918 --> 05:22.718
CLIFF:                          
Oh, no, no, I saw...            

05:22.753 --> 05:24.470
         ¶ I wish I was

05:28.341 --> 05:31.209
You know, sometimes I like      
 to play little guessing games. 

05:31.244 --> 05:32.978
Do you like to play             
little guessing games, guys?    

05:33.013 --> 05:34.113
         ( <i>all agree</i> )          

05:34.147 --> 05:35.964
             Let's play a little
             guessing game.     

05:35.999 --> 05:39.902
I just spoke to Mr. Drake       
  and he suggested that I hire  

05:39.936 --> 05:42.872
     a young girl he knows      
      to cover for Carla.       

05:42.906 --> 05:46.108
Now, why do you suppose a busy, 
  important man like Mr. Drake  

05:46.142 --> 05:47.776
 would take time out of his day 

05:47.811 --> 05:51.246
    to get a simple cocktail    
        waitress a job?         

05:51.280 --> 05:53.865
                Oh, oh, oh.     
                Uh, she's, uh...
Norm.                           

05:53.900 --> 05:55.033
 She's a friend of the family.  

05:55.068 --> 05:55.768
        Possible.               

05:55.802 --> 05:57.235
  He's, uh, paying off a debt.  

05:57.270 --> 05:57.920
          I like that.          

05:57.954 --> 05:58.804
         He feels sorry for her.

05:58.838 --> 06:00.306
He does have a soft heart.      

06:00.340 --> 06:01.440
Maybe she's                     
sleeping with him.              

06:01.474 --> 06:03.625
  Of course that little tramp   
     is sleeping with him!      

06:05.445 --> 06:07.296
                    Do you think
                    I'm stupid? 

06:07.330 --> 06:08.664
        Is this still part of   
        the guessing game?      

06:08.698 --> 06:09.765
No, no, no.                     

06:14.554 --> 06:16.922
This is just too perfect.       

06:16.957 --> 06:21.127
 Evan found a nice little bowl  
 for his goldfish to swim in.   

06:21.161 --> 06:24.946
Safe, out of the reach of       
  the other executive sharks.   

06:24.981 --> 06:26.365
      Obviously, he forgot about

06:26.399 --> 06:27.483
     the Great White Sammy.     

06:27.517 --> 06:30.302
        ( <i>all snicker</i> )         

06:30.336 --> 06:33.272
             Well, we've reached
             a compromise, Sam. 

06:33.274 --> 06:34.673
        I'm taking the relief   
        waitress job.           

06:34.707 --> 06:35.807
SAM:                            
Great.                          

06:35.842 --> 06:36.958
          What's the compromise?

06:36.993 --> 06:39.211
I'm letting her.                

06:39.245 --> 06:40.946
              Wait a minute.    

06:40.981 --> 06:42.714
I am in charge around here      

06:42.749 --> 06:44.383
and it is my responsibility     
to hire people,                 

06:44.417 --> 06:47.552
and I have just be informed     
that I am hiring someone else.  

06:50.373 --> 06:52.090
         They're going through  
         a tough time right now.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.693
         Why don't you let Annie
         work just for tips?    

06:54.727 --> 06:56.061
             Tips?              
                !               
                        Yeah.   

06:56.096 --> 06:58.997
    If I'm gonna work here,     
    I demand a set salary,      

06:59.032 --> 07:00.866
plus tips, plus                 

07:00.900 --> 07:04.536
    two coffee breaks,          
    plus weekends off.          

07:04.570 --> 07:06.271
That is completely              
out of the question.            

07:06.305 --> 07:08.190
Okay, then I demand             
that tip thing.                 

07:08.225 --> 07:10.025
It's a deal.                    

07:14.664 --> 07:19.635
I need a Scotch, rocks,         
two white wines and a draft.    

07:19.669 --> 07:21.103
                 Okeydokey.     

07:21.137 --> 07:24.056
Come on, corn cob. <i>Arriba.</i>      

07:26.610 --> 07:29.494
        Boy, I tell ya,         
        Annie's getting to be   
        a real pro, huh?        

07:29.529 --> 07:32.147
Yeah, she's sure rattling off   
those drink orders, huh?        

07:32.181 --> 07:33.381
            That's nothing.     
            How about the way   

07:33.416 --> 07:34.650
        she puts me in my place?

07:37.087 --> 07:39.121
      Can you believe it?       

07:39.155 --> 07:43.725
  Her first day on the job and  
  Evan's little tart is late.   

07:43.759 --> 07:45.461
              That's because she
              knows I can't do  
              anything about it 

07:45.495 --> 07:47.646
        because her lover boy   
        is the big boss.        

07:47.680 --> 07:50.299
              Isn't she just    
              the queen of gall?

07:50.333 --> 07:53.419
 Oh, no, that was Charlemagne's 
         wife, I think.         

07:55.138 --> 07:56.855
        Well, you know,         
    if memory serves,           

07:56.890 --> 07:59.357
  I think her name was Cathy.   

07:59.392 --> 08:00.826
Listen, have you ever thought   

08:00.861 --> 08:02.244
that you're reading             
this whole thing wrong?         

08:02.279 --> 08:04.830
That maybe she's just           
a four-eyed little geek         

08:04.865 --> 08:06.732
that Evan Drake                 
is trying to help out?          

08:06.766 --> 08:09.584
     Right. And Cliff is leaving
     his brain to science.      

08:11.237 --> 08:13.371
 I guess, you're still covering 
        for Carla, huh?         

08:13.406 --> 08:15.190
          Guess again.          

08:15.224 --> 08:18.377
        Okay, uh, here's        
      another possibility.      

08:18.411 --> 08:19.761
                 Instead of     
                 firing someone,

08:19.796 --> 08:22.097
            you send them to    
            the worst job in    
            the organization.   

08:22.131 --> 08:24.116
     Usually the poor schlep    
     just gets fed up and quits.

08:25.068 --> 08:27.669
         They've tried that     
         on me a bunch of times.

08:27.704 --> 08:29.154
             Works like a charm.

08:29.189 --> 08:32.140
You know,                       
you might be right.             

08:32.225 --> 08:34.426
She's probably just some        
pathetic little dishrag         

08:34.460 --> 08:37.645
whose last great hope           
is working here at Cheers.      

08:37.731 --> 08:40.432
I got to stop                   
jumping to conclusions.         

08:42.184 --> 08:44.736
 Excuse me. Is Miss Howe here?  

08:44.771 --> 08:46.588
    Mr. Drake sent me.          

08:46.622 --> 08:49.341
Oh, you must be the slut.       

08:51.177 --> 08:52.644
        Excuse me?              

08:52.678 --> 08:54.779
    Slot. You're here           
    to fill the slot.           

08:54.814 --> 08:57.065
              Welcome to Cheers.

08:57.099 --> 08:58.934
    Why don't you just          
    follow me in to my office   

08:58.968 --> 09:00.802
              and we'll fill out
              your W-4 form.    

09:00.837 --> 09:01.754
             Great.             

09:01.788 --> 09:04.940
  And I'll need a phone number  
    and a job history,          

09:04.974 --> 09:06.224
        and a number we can call

09:06.258 --> 09:09.294
in case you meet with some      
 horrible disfiguring accident. 

09:11.614 --> 09:12.631
Sam?                            

09:12.665 --> 09:14.066
             What?              

09:14.100 --> 09:19.287
Could I ask your opinion as     
a passionate macho stud horse?  

09:19.321 --> 09:22.290
Sure. I may have to stamp out   
the answer with my foot,        

09:22.324 --> 09:24.225
but go ahead.                   

09:24.260 --> 09:27.646
        Well, it's bad enough   
        that Anthony's lost     
        all his ambition        

09:27.681 --> 09:29.047
            and can't get a job.
Right.                          

09:29.081 --> 09:30.783
        But ever since I        
        started working here,   

09:30.817 --> 09:33.084
 he's become insanely jealous.  

09:33.119 --> 09:35.137
Why am I late?                  
When am I coming home?          

09:35.171 --> 09:37.806
Why am I dressed                
like such an ultra-fox?         

09:37.841 --> 09:41.143
I mean, if it weren't for       
the six times a day we make love

09:41.177 --> 09:43.328
he'd be no fun at all.          

09:43.363 --> 09:46.115
              Six?              

09:46.149 --> 09:47.266
                        Whoo!   

09:47.300 --> 09:50.652
    Can't think of anything     
 that I can do six times a day. 

09:52.822 --> 09:54.957
  Hit me again. Will you, Sam?  

09:54.991 --> 09:58.410
            Listen, it's kind of
            tough on a husband, 

09:58.444 --> 09:59.962
      you know, to have his wife
      supporting him.           

09:59.996 --> 10:01.597
             It's a...          
             It's a pride thing.

10:01.631 --> 10:03.698
It is a pride thing, Sam.       

10:03.733 --> 10:07.386
 I remember once when I was out 
of work, Vera had to support us.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.956
 I tell ya, the day that woman  
 left to deliver phone books... 

10:12.809 --> 10:16.645
  The proudest day of my life,  
        actually.               

10:16.679 --> 10:18.129
                What do you want
                me to do?       

10:18.164 --> 10:19.331
                  You want me to
                  talk to him?  

10:19.365 --> 10:21.533
Would you, Sam?                 
Thanks.                         
                         Yeah.  

10:21.568 --> 10:23.168
        Yeah, you're welcome.   

10:23.203 --> 10:24.403
        Hey, I saw that!        

10:27.340 --> 10:31.393
Anthony! I can't believe        
you're spying on me.            

10:31.427 --> 10:34.029
        Suddenly,               
    everything makes sense.     

10:34.063 --> 10:36.231
          You're taller than me.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.468
      You have a Corvette       
     instead of a bus pass.     

10:40.503 --> 10:42.838
    And your hair does          
that cool blow-dry thing.       

10:44.157 --> 10:46.424
  And now you've got my wife.   

10:46.458 --> 10:48.560
  Well, aren't you gonna stay   
    and fight for me?           

10:48.595 --> 10:49.761
        What's the use?         

10:49.795 --> 10:50.328
                Hey, Anthony,   

10:50.363 --> 10:51.713
          come on, now, don't...

10:51.748 --> 10:54.549
Have you ever had to defend     
Vera's honor?                   

10:54.584 --> 10:56.018
        Well, no, not per se.   

10:56.052 --> 10:57.236
          But on more           
    than one occasion           

10:57.270 --> 10:59.804
  I've held her place in line   
while she parked the car.       

11:01.190 --> 11:02.924
Could you believe that?         

11:02.959 --> 11:06.477
After I gave that man           
the best 28 months of my life.  

11:06.512 --> 11:07.613
          Well, why don't you go
          catch up with him     

11:07.647 --> 11:08.764
            and patch things up.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.899
    Forget it. He's a wimp      
    and he can't get a job.     

11:10.934 --> 11:13.035
        And his jealousy        
    is ruining our marriage.    

11:13.069 --> 11:15.437
  Not to mention that he left   
  the cap off the toothpaste    

11:15.471 --> 11:18.240
 for, like, the kajillionth day 
        in a row.               

11:18.274 --> 11:21.643
                 I had no idea  
                 that the wounds
                 were so deep.  

11:21.678 --> 11:25.747
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, 
     he can just go and...      

11:25.782 --> 11:27.482
            Oh, God!            

11:27.516 --> 11:30.669
I've just lost the only man     
I've ever loved.                

11:30.703 --> 11:32.971
              Oh, no, wait.     
              Sit here, will ya?

11:33.005 --> 11:35.607
     Listen, he'll come back.   
     Don't you worry about that.

11:35.642 --> 11:36.441
    Now, he's not gonna leave   

11:36.476 --> 11:38.409
a beautiful girl like you.      

11:38.444 --> 11:40.378
    You really think so, Sam?   

11:40.412 --> 11:42.581
Oh, absolutely.                 
He'll be right back.            

11:42.615 --> 11:45.100
        I mean, do you really   
        think I'm beautiful?    

11:57.780 --> 11:59.030
 Hey, anyone see the conclusion 

11:59.065 --> 12:00.932
of the <i>White House Murders</i>      
          <i>last night?</i>           

12:00.967 --> 12:04.002
         No! Don't say anything.
         I've got it on tape.   

12:04.036 --> 12:06.555
          Did you believe it was
          the vice-president?   

12:06.589 --> 12:07.823
    Please!                     

12:07.857 --> 12:09.091
 How about where the First Lady 

12:09.125 --> 12:10.725
      popped out of a pool      
        of her own blood        

12:10.760 --> 12:12.560
         and strangled          
    the Russian ambassador?     

12:12.595 --> 12:14.730
No... No...                     

12:14.764 --> 12:16.464
        Yeah, that              
    was my reaction exactly.    

12:18.184 --> 12:19.551
Well, thank you,                
one and all,                    

12:19.585 --> 12:21.486
for ruining yet                 
another plot for me.            

12:21.521 --> 12:23.322
    I'll be off, now,           
    but before I go...          

12:23.356 --> 12:25.824
there's something I'd like      
    to share with you.          

12:25.858 --> 12:30.612
    In <i>Citizen Kane.</i> Rosebud    
    is the name of his sled.    

12:30.646 --> 12:32.447
 In <i>Murder on</i>                   
 <i>the Orient Express,</i>            

12:32.481 --> 12:34.082
        everyone did it,        

12:34.116 --> 12:37.085
  and Luke Skywalker's father   
         <i>is</i> Darth Vader.        

12:37.119 --> 12:38.119
              Ha!               

12:40.940 --> 12:41.990
        Ah, why doesn't         
        the guy tell us         

12:42.025 --> 12:43.025
        something               
      we don't know, huh?       

12:43.059 --> 12:45.544
 Darth Vader is Luke's father?  

12:47.830 --> 12:49.098
         See you soon.          

12:49.132 --> 12:50.498
              Bye.              

12:50.533 --> 12:51.600
                    "Bye."      

12:51.634 --> 12:54.102
        How dare she put on     
        that sweetness and light

12:54.136 --> 12:56.337
            when it's so obvious
            she's nothing more  

12:56.372 --> 12:57.940
                  than a sordid 
                  little harlot.

12:57.974 --> 12:59.474
                Hypocrite.      

13:00.360 --> 13:04.362
             Doing a great job, 
             Laurie. Keep it up!

13:04.397 --> 13:05.697
I need a couple of drafts, Sam. 

13:05.732 --> 13:06.614
        Okay.                   

13:06.649 --> 13:08.884
    But, oh, you, uh,           

13:08.918 --> 13:10.034
              You and Anthony   
              still not talking?

13:10.069 --> 13:13.989
 Talking? I can barely stomach  
    necking with him.           

13:14.907 --> 13:15.940
          He's a wimp.          

13:15.975 --> 13:17.826
        Not like my Sam.        

13:17.860 --> 13:19.460
Tell me,                        

13:19.495 --> 13:21.880
        how do you feel         
about moonlit walks by the beach

13:21.914 --> 13:23.648
 and dinner by a roaring fire?  

13:23.683 --> 13:26.568
          I hate them.          
  I-I can't stand them. Bleah.  

13:26.602 --> 13:28.119
Yay! Me, too.                   
                    No, no, no. 

13:28.154 --> 13:30.638
     I was kidding. I love them.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.174
Too late.                       

13:33.609 --> 13:36.461
            You know, if someone
            ran over Laurie     

13:36.496 --> 13:41.233
    in the parking lot, I bet it
    would look like an accident.

13:41.267 --> 13:42.301
                 Do you want to 
                 make 500 bucks?

13:42.335 --> 13:43.535
Just, don't...                  

13:43.570 --> 13:45.237
Listen to yourself.             

13:45.271 --> 13:46.238
You're going crazy here.        

13:46.272 --> 13:48.373
We both have a problem          
with these new waitresses.      

13:48.408 --> 13:50.075
Why don't we help               
each other out, here?           

13:50.109 --> 13:51.810
              Oh, like I scratch
              your back...?     

13:51.844 --> 13:54.913
                And I'll scratch
                your front.     

13:54.947 --> 13:56.114
            What do you propose?

13:56.148 --> 13:58.483
Well, all right, uh...          
now, we don't know for sure     

13:58.518 --> 14:00.169
that Laurie <i>is</i>                  
<i>Evan Drake's mistress,</i>          

14:00.203 --> 14:01.453
so why don't you                
let a guy                       

14:01.487 --> 14:02.954
who knows women                 
better than they                

14:02.988 --> 14:04.889
know themselves                 
find out, all right?            

14:04.924 --> 14:06.108
                        Okay.   

14:06.142 --> 14:07.542
                 Laurie, you got
                 a second here? 

14:07.576 --> 14:08.543
Yeah.                           

14:08.577 --> 14:10.612
                 How do you feel
                 about, uh...   

14:10.646 --> 14:15.551
 moonlit walks on the beach with
 a dinner by a roaring fire?    

14:15.585 --> 14:17.819
Oh, I love those.               

14:17.853 --> 14:19.871
                Well, would you 
                like to join me?

14:19.905 --> 14:22.907
Oh, no, no, but...              
thanks for asking.              

14:26.562 --> 14:27.596
She's his mistress.             

14:31.767 --> 14:32.984
     How do you know that?      

14:33.018 --> 14:34.802
      She turned me down.       

14:35.704 --> 14:38.589
        That just proves        
    she has a weak stomach.     

14:38.624 --> 14:39.474
I'll handle this myself.        

14:39.592 --> 14:41.059
              Oh, wait a second.
              Wait a minute.    

14:41.094 --> 14:43.095
         What about my little   
         problem here, you know?

14:43.129 --> 14:44.596
Sam, I don't have               
time to handle                  

14:44.630 --> 14:46.098
some silly little               
teenage crush.                  

14:46.132 --> 14:47.399
                It is <i>not</i> silly.

14:51.955 --> 14:53.255
Oh, yes, Miss Howe?             

14:53.289 --> 14:55.991
         Laurie, my, you are    
         such a busy little bee.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.792
             I bet you just     
             won't have an ounce

14:57.827 --> 14:59.794
              of energy left for
              your leisure time.

14:59.829 --> 15:02.397
Oh, that's okay.                
I've lots of energy.            

15:02.431 --> 15:04.233
                I'll bet you do.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.868
             You know, you and I
             really haven't had 

15:05.902 --> 15:07.402
             a chance to get    
             to know each other.

15:07.436 --> 15:10.072
          What do you like to do
          in your leisure time? 

15:10.106 --> 15:12.491
Well, I, uh, I like to read.    

15:12.525 --> 15:13.542
        In bed?                 

15:13.576 --> 15:15.877
                Sometimes.      

15:15.912 --> 15:17.345
What else do you                
like to do...                   

15:17.379 --> 15:19.213
    in bed?                     

15:19.248 --> 15:20.782
                    Sleep.      

15:20.816 --> 15:22.517
Oh, well.                       

15:22.552 --> 15:25.970
Let, let's imagine here,        
that you are asleep in bed,     

15:26.005 --> 15:27.839
and you roll over.              

15:27.873 --> 15:29.006
Did you fall                    
on the floor,                   

15:29.041 --> 15:31.042
or did something                
impede your progress?           

15:32.110 --> 15:32.827
                    Excuse me?  

15:32.862 --> 15:33.812
    Oh, nothing.                

15:33.897 --> 15:35.163
It's must my warped,            

15:35.197 --> 15:37.198
wonderful, wild                 
sense of humor.                 

15:38.934 --> 15:39.901
                By the way,     

15:39.935 --> 15:41.035
                how do you      
                know Evan Drake?

15:41.070 --> 15:44.038
Well, he's uh...                
a friend.                       

15:44.073 --> 15:46.508
          Oh. Well, then maybe  
          you could help me out.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.076
     I was gonna buy him a gift.

15:48.111 --> 15:50.111
              Perhaps you know  
              what size he wears

15:50.146 --> 15:52.247
             in slacks or shirts
             or jockey shorts.  

15:52.282 --> 15:53.415
Oh... sure,                     

15:53.449 --> 15:55.350
but he doesn't                  
wear jockeys.                   

15:55.385 --> 15:56.534
He wears boxers.                

15:56.569 --> 15:57.953
            Never mind, then.   

16:00.256 --> 16:01.523
    I'm gonna pop her.          

16:01.557 --> 16:02.724
    I'm gonna <i>pop</i> her.          

16:02.758 --> 16:04.359
            I'm gonna pop her   
            right in the kisser.

16:04.394 --> 16:05.343
              I'm gonna pop <i>her!</i>

16:05.428 --> 16:07.429
    Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!    

16:08.697 --> 16:09.748
                    That's good.

16:09.782 --> 16:12.918
                 Now-Now do, uh,
                 bacon frying.  

16:19.541 --> 16:22.710
You know, Darth Vader cannot be 
Luke Skywalker's father.        

16:24.780 --> 16:27.082
        They don't have         
      the same last name.       

16:27.116 --> 16:29.050
            That's right, Woody.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.286
            I'd better call out 
            the Imperial Guards.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.054
( <i>inhaling and exhaling deeply</i> )

16:33.088 --> 16:34.005
     Stop it, Mr. Peterson.     

16:34.040 --> 16:35.323
    You're scaring me.          

16:39.161 --> 16:40.829
ANNIE:                          
You know, Sam,                  

16:40.863 --> 16:43.131
I was just thinking             
about us last night             

16:43.166 --> 16:45.867
as I was in the tub             
shaving my legs                 

16:45.901 --> 16:50.004
and pumicing the dead skin      
off my knees and elbows         

16:50.039 --> 16:51.356
and waxing my...                

16:51.390 --> 16:53.575
                Uh, is-is there 
                a point to this?

16:53.609 --> 16:54.893
Do I have to say it?            

16:54.927 --> 16:56.761
Can't you just feel it?         

16:56.796 --> 16:57.762
            Would you stop that?

16:57.796 --> 16:59.047
                  This is silly.
                  Now, just...  

16:59.081 --> 17:01.215
Of course it's silly,           
but love is silly, isn't it?    

17:01.250 --> 17:03.518
Romeo and Juliet were silly     
in a mad, passionate way.       

17:03.552 --> 17:05.086
Are we silly, Sam?              

17:05.121 --> 17:06.287
        Are we?                 

17:06.320 --> 17:07.922
                    Y-You maybe,
                    but I'm not.

17:07.957 --> 17:10.809
  Listen, young lady, I happen  
to be a very close friend       

17:10.843 --> 17:12.077
                  of your       
                  mother-in-law,

17:12.111 --> 17:13.144
      and out of respect,       

17:13.178 --> 17:14.878
  I'm ending this conversation  
        right now.              

17:14.914 --> 17:16.897
 You can end the conversation,  
              Sam,              

17:16.932 --> 17:19.099
 but you can't end the feeling. 

17:19.134 --> 17:20.819
     Honey, I'm flattered,      
    but this is nuts.           

17:20.853 --> 17:22.118
          I mean, I...          

17:22.154 --> 17:24.339
          You know, I'm old     
          enough to be your f...

17:24.374 --> 17:26.123
            a youthful          
            uncle, all right?   

17:26.157 --> 17:28.542
            I mean, when-when...
            when I'm 60,        

17:28.577 --> 17:31.213
                you're-you're   
                gonna be 22.    

17:31.247 --> 17:33.932
                Oh, my God, that
                can't be right. 

17:33.966 --> 17:35.533
                        Uh...   

17:35.567 --> 17:36.735
                all right, uh...

17:36.769 --> 17:38.753
                 All right, when
                 I'm 60, uh,    

17:38.787 --> 17:40.605
                 well, you'll be
                 looking pretty 
                 good, actually.

17:40.639 --> 17:41.807
                    Um...       

17:41.841 --> 17:45.010
            so, why don't you   
            call me when I'm 60?

17:45.044 --> 17:45.794
I can't wait that long.         

17:45.828 --> 17:46.945
              Oh, don't. Just...

17:46.979 --> 17:50.881
        ( <i>Sam grunting</i> )        

17:50.916 --> 17:53.068
    Hey, knock it off!          

17:54.854 --> 17:56.438
    All right, you, outside.    

17:56.472 --> 17:59.140
        You're gonna get        
     what's coming to you.      

17:59.174 --> 18:01.376
     I am not going outside     
    with you, Anthony.          

18:01.410 --> 18:03.244
Not you. Her.                   

18:03.279 --> 18:04.629
I mean, come on.                

18:04.663 --> 18:06.231
You're twice as big as me.      

18:06.265 --> 18:09.000
Hey, but you stay away from her,
if you know what's good for you.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.768
Thank you for the warning.      

18:10.803 --> 18:12.487
Come on, Annie. Let's go.       

18:12.521 --> 18:14.305
                  Why should I  
                  listen to you?

18:14.339 --> 18:17.041
Because I happen to be the new  

18:17.075 --> 18:20.611
Assistant Night Manager         
at Burger Burger Burger.        

18:21.464 --> 18:23.515
                  You got a job?

18:23.549 --> 18:25.283
Hey, an important job.          

18:25.317 --> 18:28.052
