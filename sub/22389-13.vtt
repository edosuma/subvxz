[jazz music]

00:03.669 --> 00:11.669
â™ª â™ª

00:19.800 --> 00:23.300
- From the Pen & Teller theater
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:23.300 --> 00:27.030
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:27.030 --> 00:30.030
[cheers and applause]

00:39.829 --> 00:42.729
- Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:42.729 --> 00:44.200
Tonight, you have a choice.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.500
We can watch
an unrated director's cut

00:46.500 --> 00:50.469
of my 1988 movie,
"My Stepmother Is an Alien."

00:50.469 --> 00:53.630
Or we can watch the show where
the world's best magicians

00:53.630 --> 00:57.229
get a chance to win a shot
performing in Penn and Teller's

00:57.229 --> 00:59.700
amazing Las Vegas show.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.469
Okay!
[cheers and applause]

01:02.469 --> 01:04.400
Magic show it is.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.400
And what better way
to start a magic show

01:06.400 --> 01:10.299
than bringing out two of the
greatest magicians of all time--

01:10.299 --> 01:12.370
Penn and Teller!

01:12.370 --> 01:15.370
[cheers and applause]

01:21.930 --> 01:24.329
Take a seat, gentlemen.

01:24.329 --> 01:25.700
- How you doin'?

01:29.599 --> 01:31.769
- Here comes
our first magician.

01:31.769 --> 01:34.400
Teller, you think I'm bluffing?
I'm not.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
Take a look.

01:37.829 --> 01:39.770
- My name is Anthony Asimov,

01:39.770 --> 01:41.930
and I'm what they call
a prop magician.

01:41.930 --> 01:45.670
I did magic for corporations,
for private parties for years,

01:45.670 --> 01:48.569
but I just felt another
creative calling coming,

01:48.569 --> 01:49.969
and so I left magic.

01:49.969 --> 01:52.629
It was sort of like
a coming-out to my family.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.370
I'm like, "I'm leaving magic."

01:54.370 --> 01:55.500
Aah!

01:55.500 --> 01:57.069
My second love
is horror movies,

01:57.069 --> 01:59.069
and so I moved to L.A.
and became a producer,

01:59.069 --> 02:01.170
but every couple years,
I'd take out the cards,

02:01.170 --> 02:03.670
and the last time it happened,
I had a lot of fun.

02:03.670 --> 02:05.700
Now after leaving magic
for 12 years

02:05.700 --> 02:08.370
and having a different
perspective, just from age,

02:08.370 --> 02:09.930
I would have to say I'm better.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.870
Now that I have a really nice
balance of magic and horror,

02:11.870 --> 02:13.500
it's kind of, like, my life.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.530
If I'm not doing magic, I'm
doing horror, and vice versa.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.729
[cheers and applause]

02:19.729 --> 02:22.099
- This next magician
is from Jersey,

02:22.099 --> 02:25.170
so if you think he's intimidated
by Penn and Teller,

02:25.170 --> 02:26.930
forget about it.
[laughter]

02:26.930 --> 02:31.170
Here with two randomly selected
members of our studio audience,

02:31.170 --> 02:34.629
please welcome Anthony Asimov.

02:34.629 --> 02:36.569
[cheers and applause]

02:36.569 --> 02:38.670
- I love a packed house!

02:38.670 --> 02:41.930
My name is Anthony Asimov,
and when you see me do

02:41.930 --> 02:43.229
what I'm about to do,

02:43.229 --> 02:46.400
you're gonna say that was crazy,
that was nuts.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.969
I was there, I saw him do it,

02:47.969 --> 02:50.629
and I don't know how he did it.
Shall we begin?

02:50.629 --> 02:52.430
both: Yes.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.199
- That's nuts.
[laughter]

02:57.199 --> 02:59.670
Sir, miss, does that look like
a bowl of walnuts to you?

02:59.670 --> 03:01.129
both: Yes.
- A big round of applause

03:01.129 --> 03:03.729
for our very observant
spectators.

03:03.729 --> 03:06.530
[applause]

03:06.530 --> 03:08.530
I'm trying to get these cards
out of my hands.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.129
The less I do with them,
the better, okay?

03:11.129 --> 03:12.800
But for now, I'd just like
you to confirm

03:12.800 --> 03:15.870
that they are different and
in no particular order, correct?

03:15.870 --> 03:17.430
- Yes.
- Yes, right here, different.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.569
Well-mixed, and
in no particular order, correct?

03:19.569 --> 03:21.099
- Yeah.

03:21.099 --> 03:24.099
- The reason I'm trying to get
these cards out of my hand,

03:24.099 --> 03:26.870
is because when
magicians touch the cards,

03:26.870 --> 03:29.599
they do that thing
called sleight of hand.

03:29.599 --> 03:31.569
You've heard that before, right?
- Yes.

03:31.569 --> 03:33.770
- Right, well, I'm not gonna
do any sleight of hand

03:33.770 --> 03:36.270
with any of these cards.

03:36.270 --> 03:38.900
Mr. Jillette, if you could
please name any number

03:38.900 --> 03:42.900
between 1 and 52,
and I will count to that card.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.670
What number would you like, sir?
- Let's make it 12.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.670
- 12. 12 it is.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.670
Now from the top of the deck,
okay,

03:49.670 --> 03:50.870
and you, please keep me honest.

03:50.870 --> 03:53.229
One, two, three, four five,

03:53.229 --> 03:56.000
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.170
Correct?
- Yes.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.530
- And we have the 4 of diamonds.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.000
Now I just have to check.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.270
If you had continued counting,
we would have selected

04:03.270 --> 04:04.669
one of these cards,
and these are--

04:04.669 --> 04:06.629
none of these are
the 4 of diamonds, correct?

04:06.629 --> 04:08.930
Any of these cards, correct?
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.930 --> 04:13.169
- But no, Mr. Jillette,
you selected the 4 of diamonds.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.069
It's time to bring out
my assistant.

04:15.069 --> 04:20.170
All I ask is the audience
do not be afraid.

04:20.170 --> 04:23.170
[ominous music]

04:23.170 --> 04:26.170
[music swells]

04:27.230 --> 04:30.300
[laughter]

04:30.300 --> 04:31.829
This is where
our alien comes in.

04:31.829 --> 04:33.129
See him coming in?

04:33.129 --> 04:35.269
[laughter]

04:35.269 --> 04:36.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Pickle.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.100
Everyone say, "Hello, Pickle!"
all: Hello, Pickle.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.129
- Pickle likes to help,
so Mr. Jillette,

04:42.129 --> 04:44.029
I'll put your card
right here in his little hand,

04:44.029 --> 04:45.500
and he will hold it
the entire time,

04:45.500 --> 04:48.029
so we can remember the card.
Sir, I have

04:48.029 --> 04:49.800
a bit of an embarrassing
question to ask you.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.500
Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.769
- Do you have an aversion
for tools that crack nuts?

04:54.769 --> 04:57.199
[laughter]
- No.

04:57.199 --> 04:59.870
- Are you a good nut cracker,
sir?

04:59.870 --> 05:01.970
- Probably not as good as you.
- The hesitation, yes.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.629
The hesitation is not good.
Here we go.

05:04.629 --> 05:08.430
I will take out some walnuts,
just like this.

05:08.430 --> 05:11.870
Now we need to all envision
the letters.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.430
Can we all do this together
as an audience?

05:13.430 --> 05:17.069
Envision the 4 of diamonds,
right?

05:17.069 --> 05:19.000
4 of diamonds.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.430
Let's see...

05:20.430 --> 05:24.470
F-O-U-R O-F D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S.

05:24.470 --> 05:26.430
Miss, if you could just hold
your hand out just like that,

05:26.430 --> 05:30.870
palm up...put that walnut
right there.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.230
Now what we're gonna do is crack
open some of these walnuts,

05:33.230 --> 05:35.569
just to prove that
they are only walnuts, okay?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.970
I know some of you
are suspicious

05:36.970 --> 05:39.500
because I'm a magician.
[laughter]

05:39.500 --> 05:42.129
I'll do the nut cracking.
- That's fine.

05:42.129 --> 05:44.870
Walnuts, right?

05:44.870 --> 05:47.699
You'd be--you reach across
and pick up one.

05:50.670 --> 05:53.399
Have I convinced you
these are just walnuts?

05:53.399 --> 05:54.870
- Yes.

05:54.870 --> 05:57.730
- Aliens are really good
at duplicating things.

05:57.730 --> 05:59.870
This is where Pickle comes in.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.500
Pickle, do your thing.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.170
Did you feel anything?

06:08.170 --> 06:09.329
- A tap.

06:09.329 --> 06:11.329
- A tap.
That's good.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.199
Here, is there anything
in my hands?

06:13.199 --> 06:14.529
- No.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.370
I told you, you thought
this was gonna be nuts.

06:33.370 --> 06:36.370
[audience gasps and applauds]

06:39.829 --> 06:41.199
Thank you so much!

06:41.199 --> 06:44.699
- Anthony Asimov!
Wow!

06:44.699 --> 06:47.100
Come here, Anthony.
That is nuts!

06:47.100 --> 06:48.199
- Thank you.
- Did you

06:48.199 --> 06:50.170
come up with that yourself?
- I did.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.170
Usually I get inspiration
when I'm seeing

06:52.170 --> 06:54.069
other magicians perform,
and I say, you know,

06:54.069 --> 06:55.899
"That's such a great trick!
What would I do?

06:55.899 --> 06:58.029
What would I do
with that trick?"

06:58.029 --> 07:00.870
And from there, you know,
magicians--good magicians

07:00.870 --> 07:03.870
want to do their own magic
and have their own sensibility

07:03.870 --> 07:06.629
and not copy other magicians
and so...

07:06.629 --> 07:08.600
So that's really where I start.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.670
- All right, well, let's get
these guys' perspective on this.

07:11.670 --> 07:13.399
- All rightie.
- All right.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.300
Boys, time's up.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.300
- You know, a lot of people
would think,

07:18.300 --> 07:20.430
people that have watched
a couple seasons of the show,

07:20.430 --> 07:21.470
had learned a little bit,

07:21.470 --> 07:23.100
learn a little bit
here and there,

07:23.100 --> 07:26.470
they would think that somewhere
on the selection of the card,

07:26.470 --> 07:29.100
you would have manipulated
my card selection,

07:29.100 --> 07:31.800
or you would have had a switch
in your hands with the card,

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
but no, no,
you didn't do that.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.100
The way you had it selected
was very artistic.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.370
Like Picasso or to be more
honest, like Banksy.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.699
You know, it was just fabulous
how the selection was done.

07:41.699 --> 07:44.670
And then,
although you didn't fool us,

07:44.670 --> 07:47.500
I want to judge you
on a higher--

07:47.500 --> 07:49.629
higher plane than as a magician.

07:49.629 --> 07:54.069
You know, because one of the
things I love about performing,

07:54.069 --> 07:56.930
and what I always push for
very much

07:56.930 --> 08:00.300
is for things
to be crazy and eccentric.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.399
So I don't want to judge you
on the--on the magician index.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.430
I want to judge you
on the nut index.

08:06.430 --> 08:11.329
And your alien misdirection puts
you at the top of the nut index.

08:11.329 --> 08:13.269
You were fabulous,
but didn't fool us.

08:13.269 --> 08:14.470
- [groans]
- All right.

08:14.470 --> 08:16.569
- All right?
- Do you understand

08:16.569 --> 08:18.230
what he's talking about?
- Do you mind?

08:18.230 --> 08:21.100
Well, I don't know
if I'm convinced. [laughing]

08:21.100 --> 08:24.699
Where did I specifically...
- He wants you to talk more

08:24.699 --> 08:27.529
about his nuts.
[laughter]

08:27.529 --> 08:30.430
- Okay, misdirection
of the alien allowed you

08:30.430 --> 08:32.600
to gather your thoughts
and get ready.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.299
Then we saw you cop
under the table

08:36.299 --> 08:39.429
and we saw you add in,
as you laid the nuts out.

08:39.429 --> 08:41.070
- Aah!
- I don't want to say more--

08:41.070 --> 08:44.629
- No, and I appreciate that.
I bow to you, sir.

08:44.629 --> 08:46.830
- So now you're convinced
that they know...

08:46.830 --> 08:48.899
- I'm convinced
that this was so much fun.

08:48.899 --> 08:51.700
Love you guys.
- Well, thank you, Anthony.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.600
Thank you so much.
- All right, bye!

08:53.600 --> 08:55.929
- All right, thank you.

08:55.929 --> 08:58.129
We have more magicians
willing and ready

08:58.129 --> 08:59.370
to fool Penn and Teller.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.700
Will they do it?
Come back and find out.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.730
More "Fool Us" coming up.

09:03.730 --> 09:07.730
â™ª â™ª

09:13.470 --> 09:15.970
[jazz music]

09:15.970 --> 09:18.929
[cheers and applause]

09:18.929 --> 09:20.669
- Welcome back to "Fool Us,"

09:20.669 --> 09:23.970
where magicians could come at
Penn and Teller from anywhere,

09:23.970 --> 09:26.429
including from
right behind them!

09:26.429 --> 09:27.769
Just kidding.

09:27.769 --> 09:30.799
They'll come out right here
after we watch this.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.070
- My name is Angela Funovits,

09:35.070 --> 09:37.330
and I'm a professional
mentalist.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.070
I grew up as a small town girl.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.370
I had this huge interest
in magic.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.700
My other dream
was to become a doctor,

09:43.700 --> 09:45.769
and I was able to become both.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.370
The nurses
that I work with joke

09:47.370 --> 09:50.769
that the Angela that's onstage
is just my evil twin.

09:50.769 --> 09:53.330
I get to things
that are daring,

09:53.330 --> 09:56.870
that are dangerous,
and I get to lie on purpose

09:56.870 --> 09:58.269
and get away with it.

09:58.269 --> 10:01.629
Medicine can have
some similarities with magic.

10:01.629 --> 10:05.899
Patients come in and they are
very much afraid of the unknown.

10:05.899 --> 10:08.169
One of the most powerful things
that I can do,

10:08.169 --> 10:11.669
is to build and establish
a certain trust with a patient.

10:11.669 --> 10:13.769
It's the same thing
that I have to do onstage.

10:13.769 --> 10:15.929
People have to trust you

10:15.929 --> 10:17.970
before they're gonna let you
fool them.

10:20.230 --> 10:21.970
[cheers and applause]

10:21.970 --> 10:25.929
- This med school graduate
specializes in dermatology,

10:25.929 --> 10:28.570
but can she get underneath
Penn and Teller's skin

10:28.570 --> 10:30.129
with this next trick?

10:30.129 --> 10:33.899
Please welcome Angela Funovits.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.899
[cheers and applause]

10:39.269 --> 10:41.500
- Thank you very much.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.330
Throughout the ages, there have
been countless demonstrations

10:44.330 --> 10:47.169
of subliminal
and subconscious influence

10:47.169 --> 10:49.370
that have proven to be
nothing but a hoax.

10:49.370 --> 10:52.700
However, dozens of studies
have shown

10:52.700 --> 10:55.600
that human behavior
can be primed in various ways.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.070
With that idea in mind...

10:58.070 --> 11:00.500
we're going to play a game.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.929
I'm going to use
this here paper ball

11:03.929 --> 11:07.399
to select one random
audience member

11:07.399 --> 11:11.830
to act as a test subject
of sorts.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.830
Please catch.

11:15.029 --> 11:16.529
You, sir.

11:16.529 --> 11:18.230
You'll make a perfect
test subject.

11:18.230 --> 11:19.730
What is your name, sir?
- Jason.

11:19.730 --> 11:20.870
- Jason.

11:20.870 --> 11:23.129
I'm going to be showing you
a series

11:23.129 --> 11:27.100
of several images,
each with a word association.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.230
So, starting off.

11:30.230 --> 11:33.230
Love.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.330
Danger.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.600
Fire.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.870
Chance.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.370
Poison.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.600
Having seen those,

11:44.600 --> 11:47.730
I'd like you now to take a look
at this blank slate,

11:47.730 --> 11:52.230
and form in your mind any word
in the English language.

11:52.230 --> 11:54.100
Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.700
- Go ahead and say that word
for us out loud, please.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.600
- Gold.
- Gold.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.370
- G-O-L-D?
- Yes.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.000
- Gold.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.970
And...sir,

12:04.970 --> 12:06.629
before we go any further,

12:06.629 --> 12:08.299
I must say.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.500
Some people might wonder,

12:10.500 --> 12:14.169
is it possible for me to have
influenced his decision?

12:14.169 --> 12:17.600
And to say that I somehow made
you choose the word "gold"

12:17.600 --> 12:20.399
with anything I have just done
is completely ridiculous.

12:20.399 --> 12:25.500
But you haven't seen
what's inside that box.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
You still have
that paper ball in hand?

12:27.500 --> 12:30.269
Please bring it on up here
and join me.

12:30.269 --> 12:32.470
Give him a big round
of applause.

12:32.470 --> 12:34.769
[cheers and applause]

12:34.769 --> 12:37.200
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.429
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you again.

12:38.429 --> 12:39.730
- So like I said,

12:39.730 --> 12:41.799
we need to get
to what's inside of this box.

12:41.799 --> 12:43.070
We'll leave that there.

12:43.070 --> 12:45.529
What I brought for you...

12:45.529 --> 12:46.799
as you can see,

12:46.799 --> 12:48.799
is an American English
dictionary.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.330
Now come right on over here.
- Okay.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.629
- You and I are gonna stand
right here

12:52.629 --> 12:54.529
and we're gonna look up
your word: "gold."

12:54.529 --> 12:57.230
That's your responsibility
right now. Go ahead.

12:57.230 --> 12:59.370
- I'll do my best.
- All right.

12:59.370 --> 13:02.269
So let's see...
We're at "gaffe."

13:02.269 --> 13:04.230
"Geometry."

13:04.230 --> 13:06.830
Getting there...
- Mm-hmm.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.200
- "Gossipy," oh.
Wait a second.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.669
What do we have here?

13:12.669 --> 13:18.500
We have page 210 on the left,
page 213 on the right...

13:18.500 --> 13:20.330
You've almost found your word,
correct?

13:20.330 --> 13:21.399
- Almost.

13:21.399 --> 13:23.730
- Go ahead and show that
there...

13:23.730 --> 13:27.000
is that one page

13:27.000 --> 13:29.769
ripped out of the center.

13:29.769 --> 13:33.629
Right about where your word
"gold" should have been.

13:33.629 --> 13:36.269
And the question is,

13:36.269 --> 13:38.129
where's the page?

13:38.129 --> 13:40.330
You'll remember when I came
out here, I started off

13:40.330 --> 13:42.070
with a little paper ball.

13:42.070 --> 13:46.029
I tossed that paper ball out
to randomly select you.

13:46.029 --> 13:48.700
Please hold this open
just like this...

13:50.230 --> 13:53.429
because this right here,

13:53.429 --> 13:56.299
in play the entire time...

13:59.629 --> 14:02.169
Is that your word?

14:02.169 --> 14:04.269
- That's gold.
[cheers and applause]

14:04.269 --> 14:07.230
Wow.
- A perfect match.

14:08.769 --> 14:11.399
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, Jason.

14:11.399 --> 14:14.600
- Funovits,
ladies and gentlemen!

14:14.600 --> 14:17.029
That was incredible!
- Thank you.

14:17.029 --> 14:18.899
- Wow.

14:18.899 --> 14:23.299
So, med school and magician.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.799
- And magician, yes.
- And you sort of always,

14:25.799 --> 14:28.230
even as a child,
had both in mind?

14:28.230 --> 14:29.570
- Yes, I actually did.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.929
When I was ten years old, I
actually wrote an autobiography.

14:31.929 --> 14:34.429
It was a class assignment
and one of the topics was,

14:34.429 --> 14:36.330
"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

14:36.330 --> 14:37.970
And I wrote on that page,

14:37.970 --> 14:40.029
"I want to either be
a doctor or a magician."

14:40.029 --> 14:43.269
Turns out,
I ended up becoming both.

14:43.269 --> 14:44.970
I found that book
a couple of years ago,

14:44.970 --> 14:46.299
and it was really
a beautiful thing.

14:46.299 --> 14:48.529
- That is so great.

14:48.529 --> 14:49.970
And do you ever get confused

14:49.970 --> 14:51.769
and do one when you're supposed
to be doing the other?

14:51.769 --> 14:53.769
[laughter]

14:53.769 --> 14:56.799
- Hopefully not at the very
dangerous situations.

14:56.799 --> 14:59.100
- That's true--well, if you
could make a mole disappear,

14:59.100 --> 15:01.799
that'd be pretty good.
- There you go.

15:01.799 --> 15:04.169
- All right, well, let's
check in with Penn and Teller.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.799
Penn, Teller?

15:05.799 --> 15:08.070
- Oh, my goodness!
- Hello.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.000
- Angela, good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.269
- We know her.
We've seen her before.

15:11.269 --> 15:13.399
Good to see her.
You know, uh...

15:13.399 --> 15:15.330
this kind of trick,

15:15.330 --> 15:18.129
I want to talk about
how you didn't do it.

15:18.129 --> 15:19.830
A trick like this
is usually done

15:19.830 --> 15:21.970
with what's called
pre-show work.

15:21.970 --> 15:24.500
And pre-show work means
you do something with someone

15:24.500 --> 15:27.299
in the audience
that is a real trick for them,

15:27.299 --> 15:29.429
but that the rest
of the audience doesn't see.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.500
And then you call on that person

15:31.500 --> 15:33.399
and have them,
"Are you thinking of a word?"

15:33.399 --> 15:34.929
And what you mean is,
"You think of the word

15:34.929 --> 15:36.799
that we had you pick before."

15:36.799 --> 15:38.500
None of the rest of the audience
knows that.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.129
That's called pre-show work,

15:40.129 --> 15:43.000
and it's one of
the absolute rules we have

15:43.000 --> 15:46.330
on "Fool Us" that you're not
allowed to do pre-show work.

15:46.330 --> 15:49.600
So you've done a trick
that would be amazing

15:49.600 --> 15:52.970
with pre-show work
and is much more amazing

15:52.970 --> 15:55.570
without pre-show work,
which you did not do.

15:55.570 --> 15:58.500
So the trick you had to do
right here,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.870
one of
the amazing parts of it is,

16:00.870 --> 16:02.899
that everything
that had to be done

16:02.899 --> 16:05.970
was done right here on stage,
right on stage,

16:05.970 --> 16:08.470
crystal clear,
and we just didn't see it.

16:08.470 --> 16:12.429
And what I want to talk about is
women in magic who are--

16:12.429 --> 16:15.070
it's a very, very
rare, rare thing,

16:15.070 --> 16:17.269
and I'm so glad
it's starting to happen more.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.629
But you're really suffering
for your art.

16:19.629 --> 16:21.470
You're wearing those high heels,

16:21.470 --> 16:24.269
and I have worn heels
in a magic trick

16:24.269 --> 16:27.629
that are very, very high,
and I know how much those hurt.

16:27.629 --> 16:29.769
And you're willing to suffer
for your art,

16:29.769 --> 16:32.700
and I appreciate that,
and there's also someone else

16:32.700 --> 16:34.200
who you work closely with,

16:34.200 --> 16:37.600
who's also willing to suffer
for his or her art.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.299
Is that correct?
- That is absolutely correct.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.529
- You know
what I'm talking about?

16:40.529 --> 16:41.669
- I know exactly
what you're talking about.

16:41.669 --> 16:43.070
- You know
what I'm talking about.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.429
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:44.429 --> 16:47.100
[laughter]
What are you talking about?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.029
- We're talking about
her great trick.

16:49.029 --> 16:51.269
- Okay, so, wait--
so, you know what he--

16:51.269 --> 16:53.799
Aah! I should have gone
to med school.

16:53.799 --> 16:55.600
[laughter]
All right.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.399
So you're confident they know
how you did the trick?

16:58.399 --> 16:59.669
- Absolutely.
- And that I won't

16:59.669 --> 17:02.269
be able to sleep tonight?
- Absolutely.

17:02.269 --> 17:05.630
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Angela Funovits.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.200
- Thank you.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.000
- Thank you so much.
Good-bye!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.769
[cheers and applause]

17:14.769 --> 17:16.670
More amazing tricks coming up

17:16.670 --> 17:19.799
including one from
our very own Penn and Teller.

17:19.799 --> 17:22.329
More "Fool Us" after this.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.598
[cheers and applause]

17:24.598 --> 17:27.598
â™ª â™ª

17:31.869 --> 17:34.730
[jazz music]

17:34.730 --> 17:37.430
[cheers and applause]

17:37.430 --> 17:39.130
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

17:39.130 --> 17:42.799
Don't blink as you try to figure
out our next performers.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.869
- I'm Ivan Amodei.

17:47.869 --> 17:49.369
I'm an illusionist.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.299
My show,
it's called Intimate Illusions.

17:51.299 --> 17:53.329
It's in an elegant setting,
candlelit,

17:53.329 --> 17:55.599
and it has a concert cellist.

17:55.599 --> 17:57.630
So the cello creates
a soundtrack for the show,

17:57.630 --> 18:00.769
and just allows you
to get into the feeling

18:00.769 --> 18:04.670
that I want you to have about
the illusion that is coming.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.900
People are participating
in almost the entire 90 minutes.

18:07.900 --> 18:11.630
My magic is different
because I really want to convey

18:11.630 --> 18:14.769
a message about life,
such as facing your fears,

18:14.769 --> 18:16.769
or finding your destiny.

18:16.769 --> 18:19.069
If I touch somebody
and it affects them,

18:19.069 --> 18:20.369
I have done my job.

18:22.630 --> 18:25.799
[cheers and applause]

18:25.799 --> 18:29.369
- Along with 18 randomly
selected members of our audience

18:29.369 --> 18:33.700
and a cellist,
say hello to Ivan Amodei.

18:33.700 --> 18:37.500
[cheers and applause]

18:37.500 --> 18:38.829
- Thank you.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.829
Thank you so much.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.099
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

18:43.099 --> 18:45.130
for the Cirque du Soleil
part of the show.

18:45.130 --> 18:48.730
[comical cello music]

18:48.730 --> 18:53.000
Hey, look, I'm as tall as Penn!
[laughter]

18:53.000 --> 18:57.029
This is a deck
of educational flashcards.

18:57.029 --> 18:59.529
Each card has a state on it.

18:59.529 --> 19:03.700
One state for every state in our
amazing country we live in.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.799
Okay, but instead of me
shuffling,

19:05.799 --> 19:08.700
I'm gonna give the job
to Penn and Teller.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.200
So I'm gonna take
half the cards,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.599
and Penn, if you don't mind,

19:12.599 --> 19:15.329
could you please take this, and
if you could hand it to Teller,

19:15.329 --> 19:17.170
and you're gonna take this half.

19:17.170 --> 19:18.670
I want you to remove one
for yourself.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.769
One state, Penn,
put it in your pocket,

19:20.769 --> 19:22.529
and begin mixing the rest.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.470
So Penn, I know
that you and I are both parents.

19:25.470 --> 19:26.970
- Yes, we are.
- Isn't it interesting,

19:26.970 --> 19:28.970
ladies and gentlemen,
as a parent,

19:28.970 --> 19:31.670
that if you bring your kids
to the playground,

19:31.670 --> 19:34.470
that you can hear
your kid's voice

19:34.470 --> 19:37.430
from among all
the hundreds of other kids there

19:37.430 --> 19:39.200
as if there's no other sounds.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.029
It's just your kids.

19:41.029 --> 19:43.799
Now to me,
when I saw that happen,

19:43.799 --> 19:46.200
I thought that looked magical.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.829
So I'd like to demonstrate
for you

19:47.829 --> 19:52.029
what that looks like in action
with everybody in this theater,

19:52.029 --> 19:55.269
and we're gonna times that--
listening for one tune,

19:55.269 --> 19:57.730
times a thousand, okay?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.170
Okay, so.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.769
When you're done shuffling,
gentlemen,

20:00.769 --> 20:02.700
may I have those back please?
You're done?

20:02.700 --> 20:05.529
Okay, hold onto these.

20:05.529 --> 20:07.630
Gonna leave these over here.

20:07.630 --> 20:11.099
And we're going to now use all
the guests that are up here.

20:11.099 --> 20:13.599
Can you please all stand?

20:13.599 --> 20:15.369
[cello music swells]
Wonderful.

20:15.369 --> 20:17.670
And Penn,
could I have you stand as well?

20:17.670 --> 20:18.970
- Sure.
- Yeah.

20:18.970 --> 20:21.130
So I'm gonna take--
you have one, yes?

20:21.130 --> 20:23.170
- I do.
- I'm gonna give some

20:23.170 --> 20:26.670
to this group of guests here.
Can you take this group?

20:26.670 --> 20:28.369
Hold on to them.

20:28.369 --> 20:30.170
I'm gonna give, uh,
this gentleman a group.

20:30.170 --> 20:31.829
Can you hold on to them?

20:31.829 --> 20:33.799
And I'm gonna give...
uh, let's see.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.000
I'll give you a group.
Can you hold on to them?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.500
I want you to shuffle your
little stack of cards, please.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.569
I want you to take one
for yourself

20:42.569 --> 20:44.630
and hand the balance
of the cards

20:44.630 --> 20:47.230
to the person to your left.

20:47.230 --> 20:48.569
I want you to do the same thing.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.500
Shuffle them,
hand one to yourself,

20:50.500 --> 20:53.930
and pass the balance
to the person to your left.

20:53.930 --> 20:57.299
Okay, everybody should--
could you hand one to your left?

20:57.299 --> 21:00.130
Yes, does everyone have one?
Yes.

21:00.130 --> 21:01.799
Here's what I'm gonna try to do,

21:01.799 --> 21:03.900
and everybody in this audience
is going to help.

21:03.900 --> 21:08.900
I am going to try to listen for
only what I want to listen to,

21:08.900 --> 21:11.329
which are the people standing,
including Penn.

21:11.329 --> 21:13.900
So when I count to three,
everybody here,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.170
including Penn,
are gonna shout out the state--

21:16.170 --> 21:17.700
Penn, take a look
at your state--

21:17.700 --> 21:19.670
that you are holding.

21:19.670 --> 21:23.400
And then everybody seated is
gonna do the exact same thing,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.829
except you guys are gonna shout
out any state that you want,

21:25.829 --> 21:27.569
and try to confuse me.

21:27.569 --> 21:30.670
So if you guys seated don't know
the states, ask somebody.

21:30.670 --> 21:33.029
[laughter]

21:33.029 --> 21:35.799
The whole theater
is going to erupt...

21:35.799 --> 21:39.230
everyone shouting a state
and I'm just gonna try to focus

21:39.230 --> 21:42.369
only on the guests
that are standing.

21:42.369 --> 21:46.269
Okay, shall we?
On the count of three.

21:46.269 --> 21:48.970
One...
[ominous cello music]

21:48.970 --> 21:51.500
two...
three!

21:51.500 --> 21:53.970
[all shouting]

21:53.970 --> 21:56.329
Oh, God.
[laughter]

21:56.329 --> 21:58.869
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

21:58.869 --> 22:02.829
Okay, so you guys,

22:02.829 --> 22:06.230
if you hear me say the state
and you happen to be holding it,

22:06.230 --> 22:09.569
I need you to just shout, "Yes!"
and then have a seat.

22:09.569 --> 22:12.269
I'm not gonna be seeing you,
so I need to hear you

22:12.269 --> 22:13.700
in order to know that I got you.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.130
Ready?
- Yes.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.569
- Here we go.

22:16.569 --> 22:20.500
â™ª â™ª

22:20.500 --> 22:21.869
Maine.

22:21.869 --> 22:23.400
- Yes!
- Sit.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.829
Alabama.
- Yes!

22:24.829 --> 22:26.670
- New Jersey.
- Yes.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.099
- Texas.
- Yes.

22:28.099 --> 22:29.769
- Nevada.
- Yes.

22:29.769 --> 22:31.970
- Florida.
- Yes.

22:31.970 --> 22:34.430
- Illinois.
- Yes.

22:34.430 --> 22:36.400
- [exhales]
This is so hard.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.130
Uh...what did I hear?

22:39.130 --> 22:40.529
Maryland.
- Yes.

22:40.529 --> 22:42.930
- Oregon.
- Yes.

22:42.930 --> 22:45.269
- [exhales] I think I got
a few more and I'm done.

22:45.269 --> 22:47.769
Um...New Mexico.
- Yes.

22:47.769 --> 22:49.170
- Colorado.
- Yes.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.569
- And Michigan!
- Yes!

22:50.569 --> 22:51.799
- We're done.
Thank you very much.

22:51.799 --> 22:54.230
This is awesome.
[confused cello music]

22:54.230 --> 22:55.869
[scattered applause]

22:55.869 --> 22:58.569
What's--

22:58.569 --> 23:00.470
what happened?

23:00.470 --> 23:02.630
- You didn't call my card.
- I didn't call you?

23:02.630 --> 23:04.470
- No.
- It's interesting--

23:04.470 --> 23:06.900
can I hear your name?
- Maria.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.930
- Say your name.
- Tamika.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.829
- Nija.
- Oh, can you say this to me?

23:12.829 --> 23:16.299
How you doin'?
- How you doin'?

23:16.299 --> 23:18.829
- That's interesting.
And then this guy right here...

23:18.829 --> 23:21.400
can you say this to me?
Say, "I love you, Ivan."

23:21.400 --> 23:23.900
[in British accent]
I love you, Ivan.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.730
- Oh, that was weird.
[laughter]

23:25.730 --> 23:28.069
Did you hear his accent?

23:30.970 --> 23:34.670
The lady in the dress, Hawaii.

23:34.670 --> 23:37.900
The lady in the yellow,
California.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.430
- Yes.
[cheers and applause]

23:40.430 --> 23:44.500
- The lady right...behind her,
Alaska.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.500
The gentlemen in the blue with
the accent, you have Arizona.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.930
Dude, you have Connecticut.
You have New York.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.930
- Yes.
[cheers and applause]

23:55.470 --> 23:58.470
[fast-paced cello music]

23:58.470 --> 24:02.670
â™ª â™ª

24:02.670 --> 24:04.500
Penn, did you shout it out?
- I did.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.069
- You did.

24:07.069 --> 24:09.670
What state do you have?
- I have Rhode Island.

24:09.670 --> 24:10.900
- Rhode Island?
- Yeah.

24:10.900 --> 24:13.900
- You are correct.
I'm done. I'm exhausted.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.569
Come on, give 'em a big hand!
[cheers and applause]

24:15.569 --> 24:16.799
Thank you very much.

24:16.799 --> 24:18.569
Can we give my friends
a great big hand?

24:18.569 --> 24:21.630
Come on, guys,
you can go back to your seats.

24:21.630 --> 24:24.130
[cheers and applause]

24:24.130 --> 24:26.170
- Mwah!
- All right.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.529
- Ivan Amodei!

24:28.529 --> 24:30.730
Hi!
- How are you?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.170
Nice to see you.
- That was so wonderful.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.630
- Thank you.
Thank you.

24:33.630 --> 24:37.230
- So why did you want
to come on to this show?

24:37.230 --> 24:40.670
- I wanted to come on
because these two are,

24:40.670 --> 24:42.769
in my opinion, the best.
- Mm-hmm.

24:42.769 --> 24:45.769
- And, uh, yeah, yeah.
[cheers and applause]

24:48.630 --> 24:51.470
I really admire
both of them tremendously.

24:51.470 --> 24:52.670
I understand what it takes,

24:52.670 --> 24:54.700
because I'm in
the same industry.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.000
I have never met them.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.500
So my little way
of meeting them right now

24:59.500 --> 25:03.130
is good enough for me, and
that's why I wanted to come on.

25:03.130 --> 25:04.529
- All right.

25:04.529 --> 25:05.900
Well, let's find out
what they think.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.069
- Okay.
- All right.

25:08.069 --> 25:09.369
Boys!

25:09.369 --> 25:11.000
- Teller just said
when you came out,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.529
he'd been dying to see you work.

25:12.529 --> 25:16.400
And boy, this is the best first
stage setup we've ever seen.

25:16.400 --> 25:20.299
I like this so much better
than a big box or something.

25:20.299 --> 25:22.599
You filled the whole stage
with people,

25:22.599 --> 25:24.829
and nothing's more interesting
to look at than people.

25:24.829 --> 25:27.299
And the cello was a great touch.

25:27.299 --> 25:28.970
It's just fabulous
all the way through.

25:28.970 --> 25:32.700
It's also important to say, none
of those people were plants,

25:32.700 --> 25:34.599
none of those people were setup.

25:34.599 --> 25:37.329
All that was done completely
the way you said it was done.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.569
- True. Yes.

25:38.569 --> 25:40.970
- That having been said...
- Yes.

25:40.970 --> 25:43.599
- We know a little bit
about statistics.

25:43.599 --> 25:46.599
- Statistics? Okay.
- Yeah, a little bit about it.

25:46.599 --> 25:50.730
And we're not sure,
in the final six standing up,

25:50.730 --> 25:54.099
that there seems
to be a little less clumping

25:54.099 --> 25:55.670
than there should have been,

25:55.670 --> 25:58.630
if that was truly random.
- Okay.

25:58.630 --> 26:01.730
- I don't want to say too much
more, because I'm afraid

26:01.730 --> 26:04.170
that we will give away too much
and it's such a good trick.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.400
Uh, what else
can I say to you...

26:05.400 --> 26:07.930
- Did they seem off?
- Do you remember, Penn,

26:07.930 --> 26:09.670
that I had them shuffle?
- Yes.

26:09.670 --> 26:11.400
- Okay, so I just wanted
to clarify that if you...

26:11.400 --> 26:13.670
- Yes, absolutely,
have them shuffle, yeah.

26:13.670 --> 26:15.000
- Okay, cool.
- And you have them shuffled

26:15.000 --> 26:16.799
too late for you to have done
anything after that...

26:16.799 --> 26:17.930
- Correct.
- But you did--

26:17.930 --> 26:20.730
You did know--
you did hand them out.

26:20.730 --> 26:22.900
- In clumps, yeah.

26:22.900 --> 26:25.329
- And the clumping
that you handed them out in

26:25.329 --> 26:28.029
also was the clumping that
the final six were revealed in,

26:28.029 --> 26:30.630
if you know what I'm saying.
- Okay, yeah.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.900
I understand what you're saying,
yeah.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.529
- I have no idea
what's going on.

26:33.529 --> 26:35.500
So do you understand--
- You remember that I shuffled.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.970
You also remember
that you shuffled.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.099
- Is that something that is
an obstacle for you gentlemen?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.029
- What's that?
- That you both shuffled

26:42.029 --> 26:44.470
and I was able
to just give 'em out?

26:44.470 --> 26:45.529
- Well, but you did have
your back turned

26:45.529 --> 26:46.769
for some of that.

26:46.769 --> 26:48.900
- I did have my back turned
for a moment.

26:48.900 --> 26:54.299
- A little bit--all you needed
to know was 18 divides--

26:54.299 --> 26:57.569
- Whoa, wait, I'm hearing--
I'm hearing judges.

26:57.569 --> 27:00.869
Hold on.
- It's hard for me to tell--

27:00.869 --> 27:03.329
- And the judges hear everything
that Penn and Teller say

27:03.329 --> 27:05.230
when they're discussing.
- Yes, of course.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.730
- And the judges have decided...

27:07.730 --> 27:09.269
- He only has to control
six cards.

27:09.269 --> 27:11.869
- That you fooled them!
[cheers and applause]

27:11.869 --> 27:14.200
Whoo!

27:14.200 --> 27:17.670
It's a fool,
ladies and gentlemen!

27:17.670 --> 27:20.670
[cheers and applause]

27:22.029 --> 27:24.470
It's a fool!

27:24.470 --> 27:26.769
Ah!
- Thank you so much.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.329
- There you go!
Give it up!

27:31.329 --> 27:34.029
[cheers and applause]

27:34.029 --> 27:35.799
All right, thank you!
- Thanks, everybody!

27:35.799 --> 27:38.369
- Ivan Amodei!

27:39.400 --> 27:41.799
One fooler just stumped
Penn and Teller,

27:41.799 --> 27:43.630
but could there be more?

27:43.630 --> 27:45.670
Penn and Teller
take on more magicians

27:45.670 --> 27:47.430
when we come back.

27:47.430 --> 27:49.200
[cheers and applause]

27:49.200 --> 27:52.200
â™ª â™ª

27:57.500 --> 28:00.369
[jazz music]

28:00.369 --> 28:02.730
[cheers and applause]

28:02.730 --> 28:04.500
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

28:04.500 --> 28:07.529
If you think we ran out
of magicians, you are wrong.

28:07.529 --> 28:09.369
Look, here comes another one!

28:11.369 --> 28:13.529
- Juggling is a metaphor
for my entire life.

28:15.769 --> 28:18.200
I feel like I'm juggling
everything.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.299
I'm coming up on graduation,
and I have to decide

28:21.299 --> 28:23.400
whether I want to go into
electric engineering

28:23.400 --> 28:26.299
or become a full-time magician.

28:26.299 --> 28:27.930
Behind me is
a gigantic whiteboard

28:27.930 --> 28:30.400
with basically the rest
of my life mapped out on it.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.799
No big deal.

28:31.799 --> 28:34.170
I was trying to put
numeric values to each decision

28:34.170 --> 28:36.430
and then try to add them up
mathematically

28:36.430 --> 28:39.130
to see which decision would be
the right one to choose.

28:39.130 --> 28:42.000
I'm a big chess player,
so I like to think ahead.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.769
Who is the opponent?

28:43.769 --> 28:45.130
Probably life.

28:45.130 --> 28:46.630
If I fool Penn and Teller,

28:46.630 --> 28:50.000
that will increase my
confidence in being a magician.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.400
What happens tonight could
change my entire life--

28:52.400 --> 28:55.269
the entire course of my future
hangs in the balance.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.269
[cheers and applause]

29:02.769 --> 29:04.200
- Ladies and gentlemen,

29:04.200 --> 29:07.369
this is his very first
appearance on television.

29:07.369 --> 29:10.730
Please welcome Vince Charming.

29:10.730 --> 29:12.500
[cheers and applause]

29:12.500 --> 29:14.799
- Thank you.
Thank you.

29:14.799 --> 29:16.099
I think the key to life
is that we are all

29:16.099 --> 29:18.900
just a piece of a puzzle.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.930
Now, of course, many of us are
surrounded by many pieces,

29:22.930 --> 29:26.130
but I'm only 21, so...
here's me.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.130
I'm gonna need a volunteer
to help me out with this,

29:28.130 --> 29:29.569
so I'm gonna need a volunteer
from the audience.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.529
Yes, you, ma'am, would you mind
joining me up on stage?

29:31.529 --> 29:33.000
Give her a huge round
of applause!

29:33.000 --> 29:35.970
Thank you very much.
[cheers and applause]

29:35.970 --> 29:38.029
Good evening. Thanks for joining
us. What's your name?

29:38.029 --> 29:39.369
- Kim.
- Kim, would you mind

29:39.369 --> 29:41.430
stepping on right
behind the puzzle box?

29:41.430 --> 29:42.670
I'm gonna have you reach
in the center

29:42.670 --> 29:44.470
and just grab a handful
of pieces, Kim.

29:44.470 --> 29:46.369
Okay, Kim, now,
thank you very much.

29:46.369 --> 29:48.799
She's very precise
about these pieces.

29:48.799 --> 29:50.829
Now Kim, would you mind laying
them out on the table,

29:50.829 --> 29:52.769
and we're gonna have
to turn 'em all face up.

29:52.769 --> 29:54.130
So yeah, lay them out all
on the table.

29:54.130 --> 29:55.900
Great, now, Kim, we have, uh...
[indistinct counting]

29:55.900 --> 29:57.529
seven pieces
for you to choose from.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.099
Now, but first,
I want you to make sure

29:59.099 --> 30:01.299
that they're all unique, that
they are all different pictures,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.470
and even, hopefully, there's
some variation in the design,

30:03.470 --> 30:05.269
they're not all, like, two holes
and two pegs.

30:05.269 --> 30:07.269
You're really examining them
closely, Kim.

30:07.269 --> 30:09.269
[laughter]
I need to you take

30:09.269 --> 30:11.730
any piece you want.
Grab it, any piece--

30:11.730 --> 30:14.430
You didn't hesitate--you, like,
knew what piece you wanted.

30:14.430 --> 30:16.170
Didn't even
think about it that long.

30:16.170 --> 30:17.769
Well, Kim, I need you
to keep an open hand

30:17.769 --> 30:19.869
and not to close it
and keep the piece right there.

30:19.869 --> 30:22.230
Now would you like
to change your mind, Kim?

30:22.230 --> 30:23.799
- I'm good. Yes.

30:23.799 --> 30:25.869
- Okay, would you mind standing
on right over here?

30:25.869 --> 30:28.170
Perfect, just hold that piece,
open hand.

30:28.170 --> 30:31.029
Great.
Now what I didn't tell you

30:31.029 --> 30:34.200
was that I actually bought two
of these 1,000 piece puzzles

30:34.200 --> 30:36.670
with a sign that says,
"Welcome to Las Vegas."

30:36.670 --> 30:39.130
And I built one the other night.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.569
And unfortunately,
as luck would have it,

30:41.569 --> 30:46.000
it only had 999 pieces.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.930
[sighs] Of course, I didn't find
that out until I built it.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.069
[laughter]
You guys ever been there?

30:52.069 --> 30:54.170
Kim, don't you hate it
when that happens, right?

30:54.170 --> 30:55.869
- So much.
- I know, so much.

30:55.869 --> 30:58.329
Well, you did pick that piece.

30:58.329 --> 31:00.599
Would you mind
coming on over here?

31:00.599 --> 31:02.269
Thank you very much.
[indistinct]

31:02.269 --> 31:03.730
One piece is missing
from the puzzle.

31:03.730 --> 31:06.029
Hopefully it's not
too hard to see.

31:06.029 --> 31:07.230
Kim, would you mind handing me
that piece?

31:07.230 --> 31:09.069
You picked one
from thousands of pieces.

31:09.069 --> 31:10.829
There's one piece missing
from the puzzle.

31:10.829 --> 31:13.170
If I orient it correctly,
hopefully it should match

31:13.170 --> 31:16.230
and complete...the puzzle.
[audience gasps]

31:16.230 --> 31:17.829
Give Kim a huge round
of applause!

31:17.829 --> 31:20.900
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

31:20.900 --> 31:24.029
- Vince Charming!

31:24.029 --> 31:27.130
Wow, that was incredible.
- Thank you.

31:27.130 --> 31:29.529
- How do you feel being on TV
for the first time?

31:29.529 --> 31:31.769
- It's a little nerve-wracking,
to say the least.

31:31.769 --> 31:33.329
- Really?
- I'm very nervous, yeah.

31:33.329 --> 31:35.099
As soon as I get in front
of an audience, you know,

31:35.099 --> 31:37.269
I kind of calm down
and I get ready,

31:37.269 --> 31:38.670
but when I'm doing a whole show,
it's easier.

31:38.670 --> 31:40.569
When it's just a small piece,
it's really hard.

31:40.569 --> 31:42.930
- All right, Penn, Teller?

31:42.930 --> 31:45.369
- Yeah, I just want
to tell you, Vince,

31:45.369 --> 31:49.900
that my first time on TV,
I lit my head on fire.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.529
And it wasn't part of the act.
- Not on purpose?

31:52.529 --> 31:53.630
- It was accidental.

31:53.630 --> 31:54.930
I was supposed to be doing
fire breathing.

31:54.930 --> 31:56.470
I spilled the fuel on me.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.130
I lit my whole head on fire.

31:58.130 --> 32:00.599
And then Teller
became hysterical laughing.

32:00.599 --> 32:01.799
[laughter]

32:01.799 --> 32:03.099
And that night, we went out,

32:03.099 --> 32:05.470
and then we had to get
the entirely different haircut.

32:05.470 --> 32:07.170
I had to cover my face
with makeup,

32:07.170 --> 32:08.970
'cause it was all
red and burned,

32:08.970 --> 32:11.299
So my first time out,
I lit my head on fire.

32:11.299 --> 32:14.869
Your first time out, you killed,
so you're way ahead of us.

32:14.869 --> 32:16.200
Way ahead of us.
- Yeah.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.829
- I will also say...

32:20.200 --> 32:23.500
and, uh...this is very strange.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.630
But we worked
on this exact trick--

32:26.630 --> 32:28.829
and I gotta tell people at home,

32:28.829 --> 32:31.099
this is not a trick
I've ever seen before.

32:31.099 --> 32:33.700
I've never seen a magician do
a trick with a jigsaw puzzle,

32:33.700 --> 32:35.829
and I don't know which one of us
came up with it,

32:35.829 --> 32:39.230
but one of us became obsessed
with the idea

32:39.230 --> 32:42.000
of a puzzle full of pieces,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.700
and then having one piece
in the finished puzzle

32:44.700 --> 32:47.670
that, uh--that the audience
member selected at random.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.529
We were working
on this very trick,

32:49.529 --> 32:53.000
and we worked on it for, uh,
a long time, a few months,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.529
and never got anything
as good as you got.

32:55.529 --> 32:57.029
So you're a step ahead of us.

32:57.029 --> 32:58.769
Didn't light your head on fire,

32:58.769 --> 33:00.630
finished a trick
that we bailed on.

33:00.630 --> 33:01.970
Very, very good.
[laughter]

33:01.970 --> 33:04.599
And I will also say
we loved this trick.

33:04.599 --> 33:08.099
I will say
that in magic methods,

33:08.099 --> 33:11.130
a lot of people think
you can do anything in magic,

33:11.130 --> 33:16.430
and in truth, there's a very
limited number of choices,

33:16.430 --> 33:18.900
even though to other people,
it can look infinite.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.970
And even though
you worked on the trick

33:21.970 --> 33:23.730
and we worked on the trick,

33:23.730 --> 33:26.130
and usually
those kind of things clash,

33:26.130 --> 33:30.369
in this case, unlike magnets,
positives really did attract.

33:30.369 --> 33:31.930
We loved this act,

33:31.930 --> 33:34.630
but we think we have a pretty
good idea how you did it.

33:34.630 --> 33:38.700
- Does any of that...
make sense to you,

33:38.700 --> 33:42.400
'cause, uh, positive stuff
was said, I'm sure,

33:42.400 --> 33:45.500
but I don't get it.
- It is very positive.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.730
Correct, sir, yes.
- Okay, well,

33:47.730 --> 33:50.970
you didn't fool them, but
you certainly charmed all of us,

33:50.970 --> 33:54.369
so ladies and gentlemen,
Vince Charming!

33:54.369 --> 33:56.799
Thank you!
[cheers and applause]

33:58.670 --> 34:00.869
Don't go anywhere
because when we come back,

34:00.869 --> 34:03.400
we'll see Penn and Teller
in action.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.769
[cheers and applause]

34:05.769 --> 34:08.768
â™ª â™ª

34:13.030 --> 34:15.768
[jazz music]

34:15.768 --> 34:17.130
[cheers and applause]

34:17.130 --> 34:19.969
- Our next act
has been performing together

34:19.969 --> 34:22.170
for over 40 years,

34:22.170 --> 34:25.230
but they're taking on
their biggest challenge tonight,

34:25.230 --> 34:28.000
trying to fool Penn and Teller.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.199
Here's Penn and Teller!

34:31.199 --> 34:32.670
[cheers and applause]

34:32.670 --> 34:34.469
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

34:34.469 --> 34:36.099
Oh, we are--

34:36.099 --> 34:39.130
Penn, Teller, we are such
big fans of you guys.

34:39.130 --> 34:41.969
We just love you, been
an inspiration our whole lives.

34:41.969 --> 34:44.630
We just adore you.
We're gonna do a trick for you.

34:44.630 --> 34:46.130
Hope we fool you.

34:46.130 --> 34:48.099
Alyson, could you come over here
and join us, please?

34:48.099 --> 34:49.329
- Oh! Sure.
- Yeah, come over here.

34:49.329 --> 34:51.699
Sit down here.
We gonna make you the magician.

34:51.699 --> 34:54.429
Hello, just make yourself
comfortable right here, Alyson.

34:54.429 --> 34:58.199
I have here a deck of cards
here, Alyson.

34:58.199 --> 34:59.670
I want you to watch

34:59.670 --> 35:03.869
as I give them a perfectly
normal shuffle there.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.070
There we go.
[laughter]

35:05.070 --> 35:07.699
And I'm just gonna riffle
down the deck, Alyson.

35:07.699 --> 35:09.800
You just say stop.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.000
- Stop!
- Oh, yeah, nicely done.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.530
Take a look at that card,
Alyson.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.300
Take a look at it.
Memorize it.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.170
- Okay.
- If you would, please, Alyson,

35:17.170 --> 35:19.400
just write your name right
across the face of the card.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.230
Near the center.
Right near the center.

35:21.230 --> 35:23.969
Write your name real big
across--we're not gonna look.

35:23.969 --> 35:25.429
You can trust us.
We're not looking here.

35:25.429 --> 35:28.369
You bust us on looking here,
you lose, okay?

35:28.369 --> 35:29.699
Right across there.

35:29.699 --> 35:31.030
And now I'm gonna have
you do something that might--

35:31.030 --> 35:32.429
watch this carefully.

35:32.429 --> 35:34.929
I'm gonna have you put that
anywhere you want in the deck.

35:34.929 --> 35:36.530
Just put it anywhere
you want in the deck.

35:36.530 --> 35:37.969
Anywhere you want in the deck.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.769
And I know you're not
a tremendous shuffler,

35:39.769 --> 35:41.800
but do your best.
Shuffle them up a little bit.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.800
Make sure it's lost there
in the deck.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.269
'Cause you're gonna do
the whole trick here.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.570
- Oh, boy.

35:46.570 --> 35:47.900
- You're gonna do
the whole trick.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.429
Give 'em a good shuffle
so you know it's lost.

35:49.429 --> 35:50.829
You remember your card,
don't you?

35:50.829 --> 35:52.599
- Yes.
- Good, that's important.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.530
- Well, it's signed, yeah.
- You wrote your name on it.

35:54.530 --> 35:55.929
Okay, here's
what you're gonna do.

35:55.929 --> 35:57.369
What you're gonna do
is when we give you the cards,

35:57.369 --> 35:58.630
you're gonna give the cards
a single cut--

35:58.630 --> 35:59.829
you know what a single cut is?
- Yes.

35:59.829 --> 36:02.230
- Single cut,
then you're gonna just, uh...

36:02.230 --> 36:04.500
give them a riffle
towards the muffin.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.900
That's what you're gonna do.
Muffin--

36:05.900 --> 36:08.699
I did touch it, but I didn't
do--see, my hand's empty.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.099
A little riffle like that?
Can you do that?

36:11.099 --> 36:12.500
There's no shuffling
or anything involved.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.170
Okay, give them a single cut.
- Okay, single cut.

36:15.170 --> 36:16.630
- Single cut.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.400
Complete the cut.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.670
And now, riffle them
towards the muffin.

36:20.670 --> 36:24.929
- [laughs]
Okay, riffle. Riffle.

36:24.929 --> 36:26.769
- Nicely done.

36:26.769 --> 36:28.329
And now, you've moved it
over there.

36:28.329 --> 36:30.500
Look through
and see if you find your card.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.670
You can turn 'em over
if you want, or spread 'em out,

36:32.670 --> 36:34.300
whatever you want, but I don't
know what the name--

36:34.300 --> 36:37.300
you have your name on it.
Can you find your card in there?

36:37.300 --> 36:39.969
- Uh...no.

36:39.969 --> 36:42.570
Not--no.
- Nowhere in the deck?

36:42.570 --> 36:45.199
- Oh, no.
- In that case, Alyson,

36:45.199 --> 36:47.130
the trick is working perfectly.

36:47.130 --> 36:50.829
Feed that muffin to Teller.

36:50.829 --> 36:52.670
- Okay.
- Feed the muffin to Teller.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.070
- I gotta take the paper off.
- How kind of you to unwrap it.

36:55.070 --> 36:57.769
- Well, yeah, of course.
- You're kinder to him.

36:57.769 --> 37:01.030
Feed the muffin--
- Hi, buddy. Hi.

37:01.030 --> 37:02.699
There you go.
- There we go.

37:02.699 --> 37:04.269
Now watch carefully, Alyson.

37:04.269 --> 37:05.530
What was the name of your card?

37:05.530 --> 37:09.000
- [stammering]
The 4 of clubs, I believe.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.170
- The 4 of clubs?
- Yeah.

37:12.170 --> 37:13.800
- But on top of that, Alyson,

37:13.800 --> 37:15.699
you also had that signed,
didn't you?

37:15.699 --> 37:17.230
- What?
- Take a look at that--

37:17.230 --> 37:20.599
- Yes!
- The 4 of clubs!

37:20.599 --> 37:22.530
There it is right there.
- Ah!

37:22.530 --> 37:25.070
[cheers and applause]

37:25.070 --> 37:28.329
That was great!
You certainly fooled me.

37:28.329 --> 37:32.070
Now let's see if you can fool
Penn and Teller.

37:32.070 --> 37:35.369
Phew, all right, let's see
what they have to say.

37:35.369 --> 37:37.630
I'll just, uh...

37:37.630 --> 37:40.969
So how old were you
when you started magic?

37:40.969 --> 37:43.329
Five, okay.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.170
Well, you're very good.

37:45.170 --> 37:49.929
Do you think you have a chance
at fooling Penn and Teller?

37:49.929 --> 37:53.269
[groans]
Fingers crossed.

37:53.269 --> 37:56.030
All right, well, let's see
what they have to say.

37:56.030 --> 37:59.170
Okay.
Penn, Teller.

37:59.170 --> 38:00.900
- I gotta tell you one thing.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.170
Out of all three seasons,
every act we've seen,

38:04.170 --> 38:07.630
this is our favorite act so far.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.030
We just love you guys.
- Wow.

38:10.030 --> 38:13.699
- You guys are tremendous.

38:13.699 --> 38:15.630
So good, so good.

38:15.630 --> 38:18.099
It's the--it's the card
in the mouth,

38:18.099 --> 38:19.599
which is a classic trick.

38:19.599 --> 38:21.199
We've all seen
the card in the mouth.

38:21.199 --> 38:25.030
We know how that works,
but you had the card signed,

38:25.030 --> 38:27.530
so we know it's the same card
in the mouth.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.900
Makes it much,
much more difficult.

38:29.900 --> 38:32.269
That was, uh--
that was a beautiful thing.

38:32.269 --> 38:33.699
But I want to say,

38:33.699 --> 38:36.469
as much as we love this act,
and we do love this act,

38:36.469 --> 38:39.570
and I love you guys so much...
[laughter]

38:39.570 --> 38:42.800
I love the fact
that you're silent.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.630
You don't speak during the show.

38:44.630 --> 38:45.969
And there's a few reasons

38:45.969 --> 38:47.800
you don't speak during the show,
isn't there?

38:47.800 --> 38:51.070
I mean, there's kinetic
reasons, of course.

38:51.070 --> 38:53.469
And there's also
character reasons,

38:53.469 --> 38:55.800
but in this particular trick,

38:55.800 --> 38:58.769
the fact that you didn't speak

38:58.769 --> 39:02.730
made the trick work
a little better.

39:02.730 --> 39:06.130
[stammering] I want to tell
you something else.

39:06.130 --> 39:08.900
Not talking
from the top was very important.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.469
But also, it was done...
rather quickly, wasn't it?

39:13.469 --> 39:16.400
You did all your moves
rather quickly.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.099
You were moving fairly fast.

39:18.099 --> 39:20.030
You were moving like
quicksilver.

39:20.030 --> 39:22.130
You were moving like mercury,

39:22.130 --> 39:25.630
like maybe in your left hand,
you were moving so quickly

39:25.630 --> 39:29.570
there was a mercury fold...
maybe?

39:29.570 --> 39:31.599
Do you think you have any idea?

39:31.599 --> 39:33.070
Is there any idea
how you did that?

39:33.070 --> 39:35.869
- Are you understanding?
- I'm speaking code

39:35.869 --> 39:37.570
so I won't break it,
but does that give you a hint

39:37.570 --> 39:39.030
of how we did it?

39:39.030 --> 39:43.599
- Aw. Oh, no!
[laughter]

39:43.599 --> 39:47.530
Oh, are you--do you understand
everything he's saying?

39:47.530 --> 39:50.969
- There have never been
two better minds in magic!

39:50.969 --> 39:52.969
- I know!
- You guys are the best.

39:52.969 --> 39:54.829
We were worried
it wouldn't fool you.

39:54.829 --> 39:56.429
What we need to know,
Penn and Teller,

39:56.429 --> 39:58.469
did we entertain you?

39:58.469 --> 40:01.170
[cheers and applause]
You guys are the best!

40:01.170 --> 40:02.630
We loved you.
Thank you so much.

40:02.630 --> 40:05.130
- Well, Penn and Teller,
you didn't fool Penn and Teller,

40:05.130 --> 40:06.869
but you put on a great show.
- Thanks so much!

40:06.869 --> 40:08.369
Thank you, Penn.
Thank you, Teller.

40:08.369 --> 40:12.000
- Thank you, Penn and Teller!
- So long.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.230
[cheers and applause]

40:13.230 --> 40:15.030
- That's all
we have time for tonight.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.900
See you next time on "Fool Us."

40:17.900 --> 40:20.900
[cheers and applause]
