00:16.600 --> 00:18.227
WALKER:
Previously on Powers...

00:18.310 --> 00:19.770
CALISTA:
Powers Division is a circus.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.398
Without help
from other Powers,
you're fucked.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.692
I call it a Drainer.
It takes away their powers.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.902
You drain me,
you drain yourself.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.155
WALKER: Green light comes on,
power goes off.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.739
It's cool that you're
Diamond and shit,

00:30.823 --> 00:31.991
but it's not like
you're SuperShock.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.117
Or Retro Girl.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.077
She's only, like,
a goddess.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.162
My dad would lose his shit,

00:36.287 --> 00:38.038
and my mom would stand
in between me and him,

00:38.122 --> 00:40.249
and she would take
as many punches as she could.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.626
She pretended to be you
to make herself strong.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.961
You were a thing.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.130
Oh, my God,
you hooked up
with Retro Girl?

00:46.213 --> 00:48.340
RETRO GIRL: You lost your
powers and your head for me.

00:48.466 --> 00:51.302
I didn't want you
because you had powers.

00:52.470 --> 00:53.637
I just wanted you.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.055
I have powers.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.349
It's really hard
waiting to find them.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.643
You are one powered
atoning motherfucker.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.103
You know what they didn't
get right in this game?

01:01.187 --> 01:02.480
No regular people die.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.814
CALISTA: It's cool,
but what is it?

01:03.939 --> 01:05.649
KRISPIN: When Powers
are around, people die.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.735
We're just trying
to raise awareness.
Who's "we"?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.320
Well, I was hoping
you'd help.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.323
It's branding.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.450
You know,
the connections between
the words "Kaotic Chic"

01:14.533 --> 01:16.202
and the fucked up shit
Powers do.
CALISTA: Just stop.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.953
CHAOTIC CHICK:
Go to showusyourpowers.com.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.039
I gotta call you back later.
Just get online.

01:20.164 --> 01:23.250
Our video has
30,000 plays already.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.169
Calista, wait.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.005
What's her name?
I only know her,
Kaotic Chic.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.965
(GRUNTING)

01:30.049 --> 01:31.342
Powers killed my mom.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.385
The world is
more complicated
than that, Krispin.

01:33.511 --> 01:34.720
My name's Zora.
What do you do?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.805
Uh, light.
I do stuff with light.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.432
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:38.516 --> 01:40.684
Don't worry.
I've been living for this.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.937
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:43.979 --> 01:45.022
Ugh!

01:49.985 --> 01:51.570
DEENA: My dad,
he loves telling that story.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.489
He always leaves out the part

01:53.572 --> 01:55.824
about the 1/2 million in cash
that went missing.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.535
You're so
full of shit.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.079
The story you've been
telling all day, I know.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.622
I'll have my things out
of the house by tonight.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.375
We know everything
their powered clients
are doing and going to do.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.043
We know where they are
and where they're going.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
You ready
to change the world?

02:08.546 --> 02:09.922
What are you
doing tonight?

02:11.382 --> 02:13.259
I have to go back on patrol.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.261
Okay, sure. Yeah.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.845
I have an hour.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.722
Really?

02:19.265 --> 02:20.599
CALISTA: I'm a Power.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.734
It is my very sad duty
to report

02:30.859 --> 02:32.570
that Retro Girl
has been murdered.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.823
It is a loss
that we may never,
ever recover from.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.034
She kept us safe.
She kept us full of hope.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.203
The world has been dealt
a devastating blow.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.749
Walker,
I'm so very sorry.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.169
Let me take you home,
or to a bar.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.213
We can go drink ourselves
under a table

02:51.297 --> 02:53.007
and let these guys
deal with this, okay?

02:53.090 --> 02:55.426
I'm okay. I'm okay.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.261
I've asked
Commander Emile Cross

02:57.386 --> 03:00.347
from the Powers Division
to head up this investigation.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.682
Commander?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.183
Thank you.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.770
We're in the process
of piecing together

03:06.854 --> 03:08.439
the details of this crime

03:08.564 --> 03:11.025
and will report back to you
as soon as we've
analyzed them.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.611
Whoa! Drive like that
and we're gonna get
pulled over.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.446
We're late. Really late.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.114
It won't matter
if we're in jail.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.949
We're not stopping.
Not for anything.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.075
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

03:20.159 --> 03:22.786
He's not someone
who accepts excuses
very well.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.164
Mystery Man's got to see
how committed we are.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.292
Right? Especially
after what we did.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.336
Right?
Yeah, he does. For sure.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.254
So...
He's really proud of us.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.714
But this is
just the beginning.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.175
The Powers are going down
one by one.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.886
A terrorist group
known as Kaotic Chic

03:38.969 --> 03:40.804
has claimed responsibility,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.848
but as yet we have
no actual evidence

03:42.973 --> 03:44.350
to support their claim.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.435
We need a shortcut.
Pop this into Waze.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.313
12650 Burlington.
See what it says.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.023
Wait... What?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.483
The address
of where we're going.

03:52.608 --> 03:53.692
Yeah, I know.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.820
This is the address
of Powers Division.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.282
We will be deploying
all the resources

04:00.366 --> 04:02.618
at the department
to investigate every lead.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.994
You do not
have to do this.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.581
This is some horrible,
fucked up shit, Walker.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.210
If there's anyone out there
who has any information

04:11.335 --> 04:13.754
that could help
in bringing those responsible

04:13.837 --> 04:16.215
for this unspeakable act
to justice,

04:16.340 --> 04:18.175
then please contact us.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.343
Why would he
want us to go to...

04:19.426 --> 04:21.136
Give me the fucking phone.
No.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.263
(CHUCKLES)
Seriously?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.556
What?

04:25.808 --> 04:27.184
What's she doing
on your phone?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.520
After you told me
you were never going
to see her again.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.938
Give me my phone.
Fuck no.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.690
(GRUNTS) Shit!

04:32.773 --> 04:33.816
Stop the car!

04:34.483 --> 04:38.028
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(HORN HONKING)

04:38.112 --> 04:39.988
I have time for just
a few questions.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.281
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

04:41.365 --> 04:42.366
Yes, Bob?

04:42.491 --> 04:43.992
Have you
ruled out suicide?

04:44.076 --> 04:46.704
Uh, we haven't
ruled out anything
as yet at this stage,

04:46.829 --> 04:49.248
but that's an area seems
highly unlikely. Yes?

04:49.373 --> 04:51.208
What makes you think
the Powers Division

04:51.291 --> 04:52.876
can handle this
investigation properly

04:52.960 --> 04:54.378
after the Wolfe debacle?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.380
I wouldn't call it
a debacle.
Really?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.882
With literally hundreds
of casualties, fatalities?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.719
Wolfe is dead.
Thanks to Johnny Royalle.

05:01.844 --> 05:02.803
Next question.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.596
So what you're saying
is that the Powers Division

05:04.722 --> 05:06.390
isn't equipped to deal
with the investigation.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.267
Next question. Yes?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.102
Why won't you answer
her question?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.270
I didn't hear a question.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.313
I heard a totally
unfounded accusation.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.523
Answer the question,
Commander.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.276
You know what?
A great hero,

05:17.401 --> 05:20.571
perhaps the greatest hero
since SuperShock,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.322
has just been
savagely murdered.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.367
And you want to
rake up some muck.

05:25.451 --> 05:26.785
For what?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.287
Headlines?

05:29.747 --> 05:31.457
This press conference
is over.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.833
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

05:32.916 --> 05:34.918
What the fuck are
you doing, Krispin?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.795
We're already late as it is.
He's gonna kill us.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.255
Look, I need my phone.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.840
We don't have time for this.
We can always come back.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.308
(HEAVY BREATHING)

05:49.433 --> 05:51.351
Hey, Marigold
where are you going?

05:51.435 --> 05:54.188
Hey! Hey!
Hey, come back!

06:26.804 --> 06:29.223
As you probably gathered
by the warm reception

06:29.306 --> 06:31.016
give by our friends
in the Fourth Estate,

06:31.141 --> 06:33.018
we are up shit creek
without a paddle

06:33.143 --> 06:35.020
if we don't solve
this crime immediately,

06:35.145 --> 06:36.605
so, thoughts?

06:37.648 --> 06:39.107
It's a smoke screen.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.276
The whole
"Kaotic Chic" thing
is bullshit.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.736
Really?
Yeah, really.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.489
Same M.O. as the grasshopper
woman, Jumpstriker.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.491
Exactly.
It's too clean.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.535
It's too easy.
Someone staged
the whole thing.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.661
Who?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.412
It would've had to
have been a Power.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.165
But the tag's right there,
Walker, same as before.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.167
And I know that he's
your ex-partner's boy,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.044
but we really need
to call in Krispin,

06:59.169 --> 07:00.629
at least for questioning.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.839
Come on, Deena, really?

07:01.964 --> 07:04.174
You think a 17-year-old kid
just brought down

07:04.258 --> 07:06.802
one of the most powerful
superheroes of all time?

07:06.885 --> 07:08.512
Cuts her throat,
for Christ's sakes?

07:08.595 --> 07:09.721
She was invulnerable.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.014
Weirder fucking shit
has happened.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.600
Plus a Power killed
both of his parents.

07:13.684 --> 07:14.977
Talk about motivation.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.020
Who are you thinking
of specifically?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.772
Johnny Royalle for one.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.899
He's the hero of
the goddamn day.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.317
What... What does
he have to gain?

07:22.401 --> 07:23.902
I haven't the slightest
fucking idea,

07:24.027 --> 07:26.071
but frankly, I don't think
he needs a reason

07:26.196 --> 07:28.031
for any of the fucked up shit
that he does,

07:28.156 --> 07:29.700
and I think Deena and I
should pay him a visit.

07:29.825 --> 07:30.951
I'm in.
No, no, no, no.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.870
You're not going to
Royalle's place or
anywhere else.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.996
Why not?

07:34.079 --> 07:37.082
Because Walker
is not on this case.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.127
I'm the only person
in this department

07:40.210 --> 07:43.380
with the contacts
to solve this crime.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.968
Pilgrim, you take lead.
Work with Kutter.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.887
Oh, Christ, Kutter?
What the fuck?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.723
You know as well as I do
that you are too close.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.978
He's right.
You know where to find me.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.938
Walker...
Walker, wait.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.775
We can talk
Cross out of this,
you know we can.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.235
No.
He just needs time.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.237
No, it's better this way.
No, not better.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.906
This is the worst
fucking thing ever.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.324
It's better.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.409
I don't have to follow
the rules.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.952
Fuck 'em.
Oh, okay.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.203
What do you
need me to do?

08:15.287 --> 08:17.122
Anything Cross
tells you to do.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.957
Including partnering
with Kutter?

08:19.082 --> 08:20.792
I'd rather gargle
with broken glass.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.462
You'll be fine.
And what about you?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.881
Will you be fine?

08:28.592 --> 08:29.801
No.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.721
But I can't let her
down again, Deena.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.097
Not again.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.560
Commander Cross?

08:38.644 --> 08:40.020
Yes?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.940
Agents Lange
and Schlag, FBI.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.274
I know who you are.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.776
Then you know
why we're here.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.112
We don't need
any supervision.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.948
Because of the
worldwide implications

08:51.073 --> 08:52.449
in Retro Girl's death,

08:52.574 --> 08:54.743
the President has requested
the FBI be here

08:54.826 --> 08:57.204
to assist you
any way we can

08:57.287 --> 08:59.122
with your investigation
as you see fit.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.416
We're not here
to take over.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.210
Only to help.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.765
(SIGHS)

09:24.815 --> 09:26.817

11:30.649 --> 11:32.943
What?
What do you mean, "What"?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.529
I'm worried about you.
I'm still alive.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.572
Mmm, so?
What are you doing?

11:38.281 --> 11:39.950
Things.
What are you doing?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.910
Pinching myself
every ten seconds.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.121
See if I can wake up
from this fucking nightmare.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.790
Kutter?
He's an idiot.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.917
He's an asshole.
He's not an idiot.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.377
What's Cross
got you doing?

11:50.460 --> 11:52.712
Pursuing the "Kaotic Chic"
of it all.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.965
Yeah, Cross is adamant
that we bring Krispin in.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.508
Let me know
how that works out.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.969
Yeah. We're going to
go to his house,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.930
hopefully question him.
Like he'll actually be there.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.849
Exactly.
What else?

12:03.974 --> 12:06.143
Nothing, just...
What?

12:07.185 --> 12:10.480
Well, you know Doctor Death
got the prelim report,

12:10.605 --> 12:14.359
so we've just gotta do
the regular cop bullshit.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.655
Ah, shit.
You know I couldn't...

12:18.780 --> 12:21.408
I couldn't handle
seeing her like that, Deena.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.785
I guess I should be grateful
I'm off the case, huh?

12:25.328 --> 12:26.538
Walker...

12:26.663 --> 12:27.956
(GRUNTING)

12:29.791 --> 12:31.126
How's Cross holding up?

12:31.209 --> 12:34.504
The feds are here,
supposedly in an advisory
position only, but...

12:34.588 --> 12:37.507
Impossibly beautiful woman
with a guy who looks like
a chunk of granite?

12:37.632 --> 12:39.134
Very thing.
How did you know?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.261
Unlucky guess.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.681
Is there anything
I should be watching
out for here?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.558
Everything.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.727
(GRUNTS)

12:51.021 --> 12:53.023
So you're just not
gonna tell me
what you're up to,

12:53.106 --> 12:55.483
are you, Walker?
At some point.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.068
Walker, I can help...
Later, Pilgrim.

Hey, I'm making tea.
You want some?

14:36.668 --> 14:39.212
Yeah.
Tea would be great.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.965
Only Earl Grey?
Really?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.426
Not much of a tea drinker,
remember?

14:44.509 --> 14:47.387
Then I suppose
it will have to do.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.473
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

14:56.438 --> 14:57.522
Tell me.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.319
I was thinking

15:02.777 --> 15:05.280
we can stay in bed
all day.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.324
And all night.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.659
(CHUCKLES)
And, uh,

15:10.327 --> 15:12.329
you know,
order takeout.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.372
Just like the old days.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.836
That sounds
absolutely delicious.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.464
And there's nothing
I would love more.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.716
Oh, no, here it comes.
But...

15:25.216 --> 15:27.677
However...
"However."

15:28.178 --> 15:31.681
There's this thing
that I can't cancel.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.309
I really wish I could,
but I just can't.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.186
But I'll tell you what.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.314
Tomorrow,
I'm all yours.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.025
And the day after that.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.985
And the day after that.
Okay.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.570
And the day after that.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.447
PATRICK: She gone?

15:49.699 --> 15:54.204
Uh, yes, Patrick.
She... She's gone.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.750
The poor kid.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.002
She really didn't
have that coming, you know?

16:01.503 --> 16:03.546
No, she didn't.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.715
You know, I warned her.
I told her

16:05.840 --> 16:07.884
if she wasn't careful,

16:08.218 --> 16:10.553
some day they were
gonna kill her.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.057
Or kick her to the side,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.559
or worse, break her heart.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.063
But she wouldn't listen.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.566
She would say
people felt safer

16:23.650 --> 16:25.360
when they knew
that she was around.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.821
She'd say that.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.748

16:38.832 --> 16:41.751
I'd like to send those
sons of bitches back

16:41.835 --> 16:44.921
to that primordial ooze
that they came from.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.884
And I would if I thought
it would bring her back.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.138
But it won't, so...

16:54.431 --> 16:56.057
Yeah, no, it...
Listen.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.436
You find that son of a bitch
who did that.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.688
And I don't care
what Power it came from.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.940
You let me know
who it was,

17:04.065 --> 17:05.442
and I'll find 'em.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.652
I'll crush their skull
like a grape.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.904
I will.
I will, Patrick.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.076
If it's the last thing I...

17:15.160 --> 17:17.412
I fucking do,
I... I will.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.209
She loved you, Chris.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.128
You know that?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.094
You know,
she's left an awful void.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.389
Patrick, bad things are
gonna start happening.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.978
We could use
SuperShock now
more than ever.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.814
I think we oughta stop
getting in the middle
of their problems,

17:44.898 --> 17:47.233
and let them handle it
themselves once and for all.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.651
Just for a few days.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.404
You know,
just to let the world know
there's someone out there

17:51.488 --> 17:53.573
to stop the madness
from happening.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.742
Nobody's seen you
in 40 years.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.828
If you were to come back now,
it'd make a big statement.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.622
For her.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.665
Don't you think
it's something
she would want?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.335
I'm done with all that.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.670
I'm done with all that
now and forever.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.714
I made myself a promise

18:09.839 --> 18:11.841
that I'd never put back on
that uniform,

18:11.966 --> 18:13.009
and I'm not gonna do it.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.177
I really think she would...

it tastes like

Are you actually
talking to me about pussy?

work together

20:59.008 --> 21:00.009
Why else would he run?

21:00.093 --> 21:02.303
Um, because he was scared.
Or because he's guilty.

we gotta bring him in.

going to answer them.

you saw Janice?

attacked Candace.

You didn't have
an appointment with her

22:16.335 --> 22:18.004
No.
No contact at all?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.630
No. I mean,
I left her some messages,

22:19.756 --> 22:20.923
but she never
called me back.

to check up on her?

22:29.515 --> 22:30.850
Her death, I can't...

22:32.143 --> 22:33.644
I can't wrap my head
around it.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.813
It doesn't make
any sense.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.275
She was an amazing woman.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.863
And you are not
the only one
who is grieving here.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.950
So if you're done
with your fucking questions,

22:48.034 --> 22:49.702
I think I'm through.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.581
I know you know something,
you little weasel.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.209
All the crocodile tears
in the world

22:56.292 --> 22:57.960
won't convince me
otherwise.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.463
I'm gonna find out
what it is and when I do...

23:01.339 --> 23:02.423
When I do...

23:11.015 --> 23:12.850
(BUZZING)

23:18.064 --> 23:19.982
You can see my dilemma.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.235
Hard to conduct
a proper autopsy

23:22.318 --> 23:24.153
when the body's impossible
to cut through.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.489
Then basically,
you can't tell us anything.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.366
Oh, no. There are
things to tell.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.660
Except for how her throat
could have been cut.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.161
What can you tell us?

23:32.245 --> 23:33.412
Well, for instance,

23:33.496 --> 23:35.832
she wasn't killed
at the theater
she was found in.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.834
You can tell that how?

23:37.959 --> 23:39.669
Not enough blood
at the scene.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.504
Looked like
a lot of blood to me.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.631
A lot of blood, yeah.
Not enough.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.008
The blood shoots out of
a severed carotid artery

23:46.133 --> 23:47.218
like a geyser.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.136
Like Mount Vesuvius
or like a giant ro...

23:49.220 --> 23:50.638
What else?

23:51.305 --> 23:53.182
The lividity patterns
aren't consistent

23:53.266 --> 23:55.184
with her body position
at the scene of the crime.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.936
And she wasn't wearing
her flight suit

23:57.019 --> 23:58.521
when she was killed.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.356
Somebody put it
on her after?

24:00.857 --> 24:02.275
Fucked up, right?

24:02.358 --> 24:05.403
But it's obvious
because of this.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.866
See this trauma was
almost certainly sustained

24:09.949 --> 24:11.242
when she wasn't wearing
her costume

24:11.367 --> 24:13.536
since there's no damage
done to the material,

24:13.619 --> 24:14.871
even superficial.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.498
But more importantly,
as best I can tell,

24:17.582 --> 24:20.543
this injury occurred
at roughly the same time

24:20.668 --> 24:22.336
as her throat was cut.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.422
So there was a struggle?

24:24.547 --> 24:25.923
Kind of. Sort of.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.093
My guess is she was
taken by surprise.

24:29.218 --> 24:32.305
And then there's this.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.224
Found this in the palm
of her right hand.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.895
She was clutching it tightly
when rigor mortis set in.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.479
So that's a rock?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.523
No idea.
Could be.

24:42.607 --> 24:43.774
Could be not.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.942
I'll send it
to forensics,

24:45.067 --> 24:46.360
see what they
can make of it.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.070
More questions,

24:48.362 --> 24:49.739
less answers.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.782
Welcome to my world,
Detective.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.285

24:56.996 --> 24:58.998
One more thing?

25:06.756 --> 25:08.090

25:11.510 --> 25:12.887

25:19.769 --> 25:21.228

25:21.312 --> 25:22.688
You shouldn't be here.

25:23.606 --> 25:27.360
Oh, well, see now,
I work here, so...

25:27.693 --> 25:29.528
Kinda not really
anymore.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.448
Or hasn't Commander Cross
gotten around
to letting you know?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.616
N... What?

25:35.451 --> 25:38.079
Oh, I get that I can't
work the case,

25:38.162 --> 25:40.122
but since when
am I suspended?

25:40.206 --> 25:42.792
Well, ever since
you became a suspect.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.253
What the fuck
is she talking about?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.296
Pilgrim?

25:47.421 --> 25:51.550
Doctor Death found
a semen sample in Retro Girl.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.012
And surprise,
it matched your DNA, bro.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.976
We had sex that afternoon.
So what?

26:00.101 --> 26:02.103
What was it?
Lover's quarrel gone bad?

26:02.478 --> 26:04.146
Jesus, mind your
own business.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.650
That's the Christian Walker
I used to know.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.860
Always thinking
fists first.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.990
Walker, Pilgrim,
in my office now.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.408
Not you, Kutter.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.827
In case you haven't
figured it out yet,

26:17.910 --> 26:19.495
I'm under a bit
of pressure here.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.455
We are under
a bit of pressure.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.166
I got Mayor Robles
calling every five minutes

26:24.291 --> 26:26.627
'cause he's got
the President
calling every ten.

26:26.711 --> 26:29.255
They want answers,
and they want them
yesterday.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.882
Meanwhile, Agents Lange
and Schlag out there

26:32.008 --> 26:34.010
are gonna help me
into an early grave.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.720
Look...
So I need to know,

26:35.845 --> 26:38.055
and I need to know now,

26:38.431 --> 26:40.516
if there's anything else
you haven't told me

26:40.641 --> 26:42.018
that I should know about

26:42.184 --> 26:44.812
before I suspend you
indefinitely

26:44.895 --> 26:47.356

and insubordination.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.649
No.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.444
No, nothing.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.364

26:56.032 --> 26:59.869
from the PAR Agency.

you can do

I can't do nothing.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.481
I understand.
I really do.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.484
But this time,

you have to, old friend.

to safeguard the Drainer.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.227

than five redundancies

28:06.310 --> 28:08.104
in the safe security system.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.357
Not to mention the security
in my lab, the house,

28:11.440 --> 28:13.901
the yard, the block,
the fucking cat.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.778
I mean,
he got through all of 'em.

28:15.903 --> 28:16.946
So we just saw.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.197
What were you doing
with that device

28:18.280 --> 28:20.199
in your workshop
in the first place,
Dr. Cohen?

28:20.282 --> 28:23.035
I was making modifications,
improvements.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.787
It is, after all,
my technology.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.289
Financed by
a government grant,
which makes it ours.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.583
I'm sorry,
who are you?

28:30.459 --> 28:33.129
Someone who knows that
you are an independent
contractor

28:33.212 --> 28:35.172
whose payment comes directly
from Homeland Security

28:35.297 --> 28:37.967
and that, in the end,
you answer to them.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.718
Which in turn means us.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.262
I remember you.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.806
You're the assholes
who are eight months
behind in paying me.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.349
Take it up with the GAO.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.977
My point is a valuable piece
of government technology

28:48.060 --> 28:49.353
was stolen
from your facility

28:49.478 --> 28:52.148
by the number one suspect
in the Retro Girl murder.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.733
Motive, check.
Means, check.

28:54.817 --> 28:55.901
WALKER: I don't buy it.

28:56.193 --> 28:59.488
A bunch of kids stole
the Drainer and then, what?

28:59.572 --> 29:01.657
Lured Retro Girl to a place

29:01.782 --> 29:03.033
where they could
slit there throat?

29:03.159 --> 29:04.243
Come on.
Maybe they did

29:04.326 --> 29:05.953
if they had help.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.081
Seriously?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.293
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You...

29:12.710 --> 29:13.878

29:14.003 --> 29:17.173
You can just collectively
all go fuck yourselves.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.136
You're just gonna
let him walk out
of here, Commander?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.512
In a word, yes.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.015
Harley Cohen
is at the very least

29:26.140 --> 29:28.058
a person of interest
in this investigation.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.268
Don't you think
it would be prudent

29:29.351 --> 29:30.811
to hold him
for further questioning?

29:30.895 --> 29:32.062
I do not.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.189
Ah.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.941
So you understand
I'm going to have
to report this

29:36.025 --> 29:37.693
to my superiors.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.946
Oh, so much for just
"helping out," eh,
Agent Lange?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.782
I'm helping you to see
the global implications

29:43.866 --> 29:45.284
of your actions,
Commander.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.453
If Drainer technology
becomes available

29:47.536 --> 29:50.039
on the black market,
it's open season

29:50.164 --> 29:52.166
on the Powers community
world-wide.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.793
How happy would
the President be

29:54.877 --> 29:56.045
facing world leaders

29:56.170 --> 29:58.297
explaining how
we allowed it to happen?

29:58.380 --> 30:01.675
Not particularly happy,
I imagine.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.266
You want to know
what I think?

30:09.391 --> 30:11.602
It doesn't matter
what you think.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.562
It's Brian's son,
Emile.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.982
He is our best
and only suspect, Walker.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.400
And now we have evidence

30:18.484 --> 30:20.778
that he stole the only
piece of technology

30:20.903 --> 30:23.697
capable of rendering
Retro Girl vulnerable.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.074
So,

30:26.575 --> 30:30.829
unless you have some tangible,
incontrovertible evidence

30:30.913 --> 30:33.123
that could convince me
otherwise.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.543
I thought as much.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.755
Go home, Christian.
Please.

I... I don't know how else
to say this.

You're not exactly
the target audience,

33:19.873 --> 33:21.417
with all due respect.

33:21.542 --> 33:22.876
All right.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.629
Pitch me.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.300
In the wake
of Retro Girl's murder,

33:30.426 --> 33:32.469
is Los Angeles truly safe?

33:32.594 --> 33:33.595
Go on.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.099
Nefarious Powers are now
free to rampage the city.

33:37.224 --> 33:41.145
Nefarious? Now there's
a word I haven't heard
used since, oh, 1890.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.439
Authorities are cautioning
citizens to beware.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.107
There are dark times ahead.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.483
No one can be trusted.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.069
Stay inside,
lock your doors.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.988
If they can kill
Retro Girl...

33:51.447 --> 33:52.656
No one is safe.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.533
Something like that, yeah.

33:54.867 --> 33:55.909
Not bad.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.286
Clean out the cliches.

33:57.411 --> 34:00.122
Find a source or at least
a sound bite that hints
any of this bullshit.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.748
It's not bullshit, Terry.
Don't get me wrong.

34:01.832 --> 34:04.126
It's good bullshit,
but bullshit nevertheless.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.545
When I started out,
we reported the news.
We didn't make it.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.339
And times have changed.
You have the wheel now.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.592
Fuck you, and whip
that bag of shit up

34:11.675 --> 34:12.718
by tonight's broadcast.
It'll be our lead.

Thank y'all very much.

Todd Secor here
every Thursday, Saturday.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.798
Is that you, Diana?

34:52.841 --> 34:54.343
Hello, Daddy.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.555
Calista,
is that actually you?

35:00.182 --> 35:01.975
You used to play
that song for me.

35:03.310 --> 35:07.272
Did I? Well, can't go wrong
with Hank Williams.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.441
Here's a real crowd pleaser.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.654
Come on into the light.
Let's have a look at you.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.866
Well, well, well,
you're all...

35:17.950 --> 35:20.285
You're all grown up
and womanly.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.287
Yeah. That happens.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.082
Especially when you haven't
seen someone in ten years.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.209
Well, now, that was
your mama running off

35:27.334 --> 35:29.169
with you in the middle
of the night leaving me.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.879
It wasn't my decision.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.715
How is the old gal anyway?

35:34.466 --> 35:35.634
She's dead.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.428

35:38.554 --> 35:40.222
Slow, painful brain cancer.

35:41.557 --> 35:43.308
Well, I'm sorry about that,
Calista, I didn't...

35:43.392 --> 35:44.893
I'm sure her getting
beat to shit every night

35:45.018 --> 35:46.853
you came home drunk
didn't help either.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.230
Well, now,

35:48.689 --> 35:50.357
that was some time ago,
Calista.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.944
And yet her screams
are still stuck in my head.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.571
Go figure.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.491
So, uh,
what are you doing here?

35:59.575 --> 36:01.159
Do... Do you need
some money, or...

36:01.827 --> 36:03.036
No.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.289
I was looking for something

36:05.414 --> 36:08.125
a little bit more cathartic.

36:08.417 --> 36:09.710
Ah!

36:11.920 --> 36:13.589
Fasten your seatbelt,
Daddy.

36:13.714 --> 36:15.257
It's gonna be
a bumpy ride.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.467
Ah! Calista!

36:17.759 --> 36:19.303
(KNOCKING)

36:21.430 --> 36:24.182
Wow. To what do
I owe this honor?

36:24.266 --> 36:26.393
A father can't check in
on his daughter?

36:26.476 --> 36:28.228
It's just I haven't heard
a peep out of you

36:28.312 --> 36:31.440
since I moved out
four weeks ago.

36:31.648 --> 36:34.318
Well, I'm here now,
so may I come in?

36:36.153 --> 36:38.155
Make yourself at home.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.123
So...

36:48.248 --> 36:50.459
I'm gonna give it
to you straight.
Good, what?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.961
You need to get out of
Powers Division.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.254
Thanks for dropping by.

36:54.338 --> 36:56.298
I'm dead serious, pumpkin.
Don't call me that.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.841
I've been calling
you that since...

36:57.966 --> 36:59.801
Don't call me that.
Look, just hear me out.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.720
I got my ear
to the wall on this one.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.139
The feds are looking to flush
the PD down the toilet

37:04.222 --> 37:05.349
on the Retro Girl case.

37:05.474 --> 37:06.975
Oh, yeah.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.061
I can feel the crosshairs
on the back of my neck,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.812
but I don't give a damn.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.439
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.275
When the shit goes down,
and it will,

37:15.359 --> 37:16.693
there'll be no recovery.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.988
Sure. You can leave now.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.955
Wait. This is about you,
isn't it?

37:29.039 --> 37:30.540
No.
I get it.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.334
You don't want to be
embarrassed.

37:32.459 --> 37:33.835
The same old shit.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.463
The great Waldo Pilgrim
afraid

37:36.546 --> 37:38.965
some of the skeletons are
rattling around in his closet

37:39.049 --> 37:41.176
are going to jump out
and bite him in the ass.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.137
You got me all wrong,
pumpkin.

37:44.221 --> 37:45.847
You truly do.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.937
Do you know
what the asshole did?

37:52.020 --> 37:53.855
Which asshole
in particular?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.982
Right, I forget
I'm surrounded
by assholes,

37:56.066 --> 37:57.401
present company included.

37:57.526 --> 37:58.610
Not today, Deena.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.988
My father.
Biggest asshole
of them all.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.281
Okay.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.117
What did he do
this time?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.786
He wants me to bail
on Powers Division.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.872
Says he has it
on good authority
we gonna get shut down.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.042
Well, he's probably right.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.961
Fuck. Not you, too.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.587
It's a distinct
possibility, Deena.

38:17.713 --> 38:20.632
I know.
Just don't want to know.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.094
So what do we do?
(TEA KETTLE WHISTLING)

38:24.219 --> 38:25.887
Solve the crime.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.139
So find Krispin?

38:27.347 --> 38:28.724
It's not Krispin.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.434
How can you be so sure?

38:30.726 --> 38:32.894
'Cause I've known the kid
for ten years.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.855
I used to go fishing
with him and his dad

38:34.938 --> 38:36.732
up at Lake Casitas.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.401
He likes to draw cartoons,
for Christ's sake.

38:39.526 --> 38:40.736
He's not a killer.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.237
Does that mean
you found something else?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.364
Something that points
in a different direction?

38:44.448 --> 38:48.034
Yeah.
After I saw her that day,
she had an appointment.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.704
She didn't say
where or what.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.248
I checked
her personal calendar.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.125
She had one entry, D-day.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.085
Not very helpful.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.587
Particularly from someone

38:58.712 --> 39:01.173
who participated
in the actual D-day.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.176
Yeah, but when I questioned
her agent about it,
he flinched.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.677
He knows something, Deena.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.096
I'm gonna find out
what it is.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.389
(PHONE RINGING)

39:17.814 --> 39:19.983
Hello?
KRISPIN: Walker, it's me.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.195
Where are you?
It's all bad.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.863
I didn't mean for...

39:24.946 --> 39:27.616
Look, I was trying
to make a statement.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.494
I wasn't trying to...
Just calm down.

39:30.619 --> 39:33.371
Son, just calm down.
Tell me where you are.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.248
I'm at the lake house.

39:35.332 --> 39:37.584
You remember, um...
Yeah, I remember.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.504
Okay, listen to me.
I'm gonna come get you, okay?

39:40.629 --> 39:43.089
You stay there.
You'll be safe there.

39:43.173 --> 39:46.802
We're gonna get this
all straightened out.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.137
Okay, okay.

39:49.971 --> 39:54.392
Krisp, I promise you
everything's gonna be okay.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.561
Don't talk to me.
I know what you're
gonna say.

39:56.645 --> 39:57.896
Walker, I can't just
let you promise

39:57.979 --> 39:59.648
everything's going
to be okay.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.775
Just give me a head start.
Half hour, tops.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.319
Oh, oh.
The kid's scared shitless.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.030
Let me settle him down
so he doesn't do
anything stupid.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.074
I can do that.
For the record,

40:09.157 --> 40:12.452
I still don't think
he had anything
to do with it.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.162
Order up the helicopter.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.331
(BOTH SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)

40:24.798 --> 40:26.091
Why are you doing this?

40:26.174 --> 40:27.175
Funny,
that's what Mama said

40:27.259 --> 40:28.718
every time you threw her
against the door.

40:28.844 --> 40:29.845
Oh, God. (GASPING)

40:31.638 --> 40:33.849
I know I was a fucking
bastard back then,

40:33.932 --> 40:36.560
but you don't know
the other side of it.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.979
Tell that to someone
who gives a shit.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.856
Fuck, I can't breathe.

40:41.523 --> 40:42.691
Good.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.903
Maybe I deserve to die

40:47.028 --> 40:49.698
but I don't think
you want to go through

the rest of your life
knowing you murdered

an unarmed man
in cold blood.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.871
(COUGHS)

about this moment

40:57.581 --> 41:00.208
almost every single day
of my life.

41:00.292 --> 41:03.420
I promise
I won't have any regrets.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.842
You're just like
your mama after all.

41:08.925 --> 41:12.053
Think you can fix
the whole world
all by yourself.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.307
I'da thought you were
smarter than that.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.477
(SCREAMS)

Yes?

side of the road.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.399
I don't know what happened,
but he's in real bad shape.

I'll get an orderly.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.362
(GROANING)

42:13.198 --> 42:14.950
I made a mistake.

42:15.909 --> 42:17.786
My father I'm angry at

42:18.662 --> 42:20.538
left long ago.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.123
And you,

42:22.248 --> 42:24.292
you're just a pitiful
old man

42:24.376 --> 42:26.920
that's gonna die
alone and miserable.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.089
And that's just

42:29.798 --> 42:31.216
sad.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.972
Good-bye, Daddy.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.018
TERRY: We've just
learned from sources

42:42.143 --> 42:43.228
close to the investigation

42:43.311 --> 42:44.813
into the death
of Retro Girl

42:44.938 --> 42:47.649
that authorities
are closing in on
the prime suspect.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.651
But rumors persist
that this assassination

42:49.776 --> 42:51.611
is not the work
of one lone perpetrator...
(BEEPING)

42:51.695 --> 42:54.155
...but a conspiracy of trained
political agitators...

Zora?
What is Kaotic Chic?

42:55.991 --> 42:58.034
What are you doing?
Getting the hell out of here.

42:58.159 --> 43:00.161
Wait, wait. Zora!

43:01.329 --> 43:03.832
в™Є I'm aware of this

43:03.957 --> 43:06.292

43:13.883 --> 43:16.845
в™Є I did let you in

43:16.970 --> 43:19.014
Yeah, Pilgrim?
DEENA: I did my best.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.765
But the feds got wind
we were up to something,

43:20.849 --> 43:22.851
and they're trailing us
in a helicopter.

43:22.976 --> 43:25.687
Fuck! Shit!
My thoughts exactly.

43:25.812 --> 43:26.813
They're tapping our phones.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.273
Of course they are.

You got it.

в™Є Let me show you now
