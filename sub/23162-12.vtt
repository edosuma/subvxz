00:02.920 --> 00:05.867
Welcome to the carnival.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.334
You must be
my new roustabouts.

00:07.391 --> 00:09.393
This carnival
isn't safe anymore.

00:13.064 --> 00:14.668
Gus the Geek.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.474
Subhuman.

00:17.535 --> 00:19.515
I haven't written a paycheck
in three weeks.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.640
Take it easy.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.712
Hey.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.383
The carnival is over.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.628
Congratulations, kid. That
was quite extraordinary.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.962
A walk in the park. Thank
your buddy up there, okay?

03:41.022 --> 03:43.696
Of course. Better take a rest, Robin.
You're on again at 3:00.

03:43.758 --> 03:44.828
Right. See ya, Inky.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.701
Mr. Higgins. Mikey.
Robin.

03:51.399 --> 03:55.370
Thanks a lot, Higgo. You made
this gig go with a real bang.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.306
Here, I brought you
a little something.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.785
Please, it was the least
I could do, Walter.

04:00.842 --> 04:03.220
Walter?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.779
I haven't heard that
since...

04:04.846 --> 04:06.621
North Africa, 1942.

04:09.651 --> 04:12.996
That's right.
Open it up later.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.697
Well, Mr. Janes.
What do ya think?

04:15.757 --> 04:18.930
I think my company is lucky to
have your carnival, Mr. Gilbert.

04:19.027 --> 04:21.632
It hope it will be a profitable
situation for both of us.

04:21.796 --> 04:22.831
Don't you worry
about the profits.

04:22.897 --> 04:24.240
We'll bring in the audience,
I guarantee it.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.871
Why, we broke all
house records on Guam.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.246
You should've... Hey, great flying.
You didn't miss.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.148
Quite. Well done, T.C.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.550
A real good
piece of work.

04:34.609 --> 04:35.815
Thank you.

04:35.877 --> 04:37.914
But somehow, I must admit,
I felt more comfortable

04:37.979 --> 04:40.516
flying and being shot at
at the same time.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.934
<i>Magic to Worthy,
inside to Kareem, back to Scott,</i>

04:54.996 --> 04:57.567
<i>drives, dishes off to Kareem.
Slam dunk!</i>

05:00.201 --> 05:01.737
<i>Length of the court
to Parrish,</i>

05:01.803 --> 05:05.683
<i>to Bird, to McHale, to Johnson, back to Ainge.
Twenty-footer, no good!</i>

05:05.740 --> 05:07.481
<i>Rambis rebound!
He is butchered.</i>

05:07.542 --> 05:08.714
Magnum.

05:09.544 --> 05:10.989
<i>Look at Rambis,
he is hot under the collar.</i>

05:11.045 --> 05:12.456
<i>He's pulling his glasses back,
adjusting those.</i>

05:12.547 --> 05:17.690
Don't... Don't ever
do that again, Higgins.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.924
I'm sorry, Magnum.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.934
What is it?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.800
You so excited about going
on all those neat rides,

05:25.860 --> 05:27.430
you forgot to knock?

05:27.495 --> 05:30.169
You got cotton candy
stuck on your cheek?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.839
What is it?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.647
T.C?

05:42.543 --> 05:46.719
T.C.'s fine. The stunt
went off without a hitch.

05:47.615 --> 05:51.461
The girl was murdered
five minutes later.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.564
I am asking
for your assistance.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.695
What about the police?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.933
They're investigating.

06:04.499 --> 06:06.445
Did you know this girl?

06:06.501 --> 06:08.037
Only briefly.

06:08.703 --> 06:12.981
But I do know
Walter, Inky, Gilbert.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.747
I must help him.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.991
We had had no sleep
in 72 hours.

06:25.386 --> 06:29.163
The shelling was incessant
and unrelenting.

06:30.258 --> 06:33.728
We were pinned down
by heavy machine gun fire.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.876
Suffice it to say, Magnum, I owe Inky
Gilbert and his brother, Donald,

06:40.935 --> 06:44.849
two Americans who were attached
to our unit, a great debt.

06:47.441 --> 06:51.685
Higgins, soldiers saving
other soldiers' lives

06:51.746 --> 06:53.953
is a common occurrence. We've both...
Yes, but,

06:55.349 --> 06:58.990
in the course
of this incident,

06:59.921 --> 07:04.370
Inky lost his brother.
I'd like to help him.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.500
I'd like for you to help him.

07:08.563 --> 07:11.009
You will, of course,
be compensated.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.343
Well, that's not really the point, Higgins.
The police...

07:13.434 --> 07:16.415
Are conducting
an investigation.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.314
Meanwhile, the adverse publicity
surrounding this tragedy

07:19.373 --> 07:21.444
could cause Inky Gilbert
to lose his contract

07:21.509 --> 07:24.285
with Mike Janes Amusements.
It could break him.

07:27.949 --> 07:31.453
Magnum, I implore you.
Please help.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.394
This feels great!

07:35.456 --> 07:36.833
We're also gonna
have to work here, Rick.

07:36.891 --> 07:37.892
I don't care.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.996
For the first time in your
life, you've done me a favor.

07:40.061 --> 07:41.199
This one's for Higgins.

07:41.329 --> 07:44.071
Yeah, maybe, but... Hey, can I
have a cotton candy, please?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.132
Rick...

07:45.299 --> 07:47.438
Thomas, please, the carnival's
always been my first love.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.276
I ran away with one
when I was 14 years old

07:49.337 --> 07:50.611
and I was gone
for three weeks.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.345
When my old man finally got me, man,
I couldn't sit down for a month.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.819
I mean, I couldn't eat anything
but vanilla milk shakes

07:55.877 --> 07:57.982
and tomato soup. Then I ran
away with the circus...

07:59.547 --> 08:00.992
Did I ever tell you
this before?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.119
Hey, that's my cotton candy.

08:06.821 --> 08:07.822
Come in.

08:10.358 --> 08:11.769
Mr. Gilbert.

08:13.227 --> 08:15.070
Welcome.

08:15.129 --> 08:16.767
You must be
my new roustabouts.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.139
Yep.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.549
Which one's the P.l.?

08:24.038 --> 08:25.847
Thomas Magnum.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.584
Rick Wright.

08:27.642 --> 08:30.020
You know, I ran away with a carnival once.
I was 14 years old.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.613
I was gone for three weeks.
Rick...

08:31.679 --> 08:32.885
When my old man
got me, man, I couldn't...

08:32.980 --> 08:33.981
Rick...

08:34.115 --> 08:37.823
That's all right. I still
feel I'm 14 years old, too.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.923
There's got to be a little boy
inside you to stay in this racket.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.900
God knows it isn't
going to be around long.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.562
The carnivals that crisscross
this country,

08:45.626 --> 08:48.072
playing the country fairs
and revivals,

08:48.129 --> 08:50.336
are soon gonna be
a thing of the past.

08:50.398 --> 08:53.242
A dying piece of Americana.

08:53.301 --> 08:55.144
The midway and the sideshow
are being replaced

08:55.202 --> 08:58.081
by the computer arcade
and the cheap horror films

08:58.139 --> 08:59.447
that are churned out
every five minutes

08:59.507 --> 09:02.750
and don't leave
anything to the imagination.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.346
The mind.

09:05.179 --> 09:06.954
The kid in all of us.

09:07.014 --> 09:10.291
I don't know, maybe America's
grown out of us.

09:12.887 --> 09:15.663
Maybe the little boy
grew up too fast.

09:15.823 --> 09:19.896
He blinks his eyes and he becomes
a lawyer or a computer operator

09:21.262 --> 09:23.401
or a bank teller.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.943
We carnies just
try to get by.

09:26.934 --> 09:31.349
And we try to reach out
to the kid out there.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.654
I'm glad we reached you.

09:35.710 --> 09:38.748
What happens if you don't
reach that kid out there?

09:39.313 --> 09:41.793
Then I sell out
lock, stock and barrel

09:41.849 --> 09:45.558
to Mike Janes and his modern,
"today's" operation.

09:47.121 --> 09:50.000
And we become a quaint
historical footnote,

09:51.125 --> 09:53.731
a sanitized piece of trivia.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.408
I don't want that
to happen to my people.

09:58.466 --> 10:01.276
They're loyal, and most of them
have been with me for a long time,

10:01.335 --> 10:03.781
but they've got to eat.

10:05.373 --> 10:08.286
I haven't written a paycheck
in three weeks.

10:09.543 --> 10:14.185
And unless you guys find out who did
that to poor Robin, God rest her soul,

10:14.248 --> 10:16.285
I'll never write another one.

10:23.758 --> 10:25.465
<i>Rick may have felt
nine years old again,</i>

10:25.526 --> 10:27.938
<i>but somehow I found that
a little bit difficult.</i>

10:28.095 --> 10:29.802
<i>Because even when I was
nine years old</i>

10:29.864 --> 10:32.401
<i>and my grandpa took me to the
carnival at the county fair,</i>

10:32.466 --> 10:35.208
<i>I found myself
asking too many questions.</i>

10:35.269 --> 10:38.409
<i>Questions like, in the
basketball shooting concession,</i>

10:38.472 --> 10:41.715
<i>why was the ball pumped so full
of air that it would bounce off</i>

10:41.776 --> 10:44.347
<i>the too-small rim
and there goes your quarter?</i>

10:44.412 --> 10:46.824
<i>Or why did the beautiful blonde
lady in the dollar-a-kiss booth</i>

10:46.881 --> 10:49.589
<i>smell like a distillery
from 20 feet away?</i>

10:49.650 --> 10:51.357
<i>Or how come
the biggest stuffed animals</i>

10:51.419 --> 10:53.763
<i>you could possibly win
in the shooting gallery</i>

10:53.821 --> 10:55.767
<i>always had an inch
of dust on them?</i>

10:55.823 --> 10:57.734
<i>And now, a lot of years later,</i>

10:57.858 --> 11:01.169
<i>who would want to make a
murder part of the sideshow?</i>

11:01.295 --> 11:02.706
Hello?

11:03.798 --> 11:06.210
Hey, take it easy.

11:06.901 --> 11:11.475
Sorry, I'm a little on edge.
You're the P.l.?

11:12.239 --> 11:13.843
Yeah.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.279
Except it's Private Investigator,
and I'm supposed to be undercover.

11:18.779 --> 11:22.818
Daddy's got a big mouth. Audrey Gilbert.
lnky's little girl.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.392
Aka "Sparky The Clown"
and midway manager.

11:26.487 --> 11:29.627
Nice meeting you. How many other
people know why I'm here?

11:29.690 --> 11:32.466
Just me and Inky.
Honest.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.707
How can I help you?

11:36.630 --> 11:40.703
Well, tell me about Robin. Boyfriends?
Enemies? Debts?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.076
None of the above.

11:42.136 --> 11:45.345
Everybody liked Robin and
Robin liked everybody back.

11:45.406 --> 11:47.317
Been with us for two years.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.446
Joined us in Stockton
when she ran away from home.

11:50.511 --> 11:53.185
Can't think of a damn thing
anybody would have against her.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.252
What about that knife thrower?
The Indian?

11:56.350 --> 11:57.420
The Chief?

11:57.485 --> 11:59.396
Audrey, Audrey.

11:59.487 --> 12:00.966
Yeah, him.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.693
Who is he?

12:02.756 --> 12:05.532
This is Thomas Magnum.

12:05.593 --> 12:07.573
Inky just hired him
as the new roustabout.

12:07.628 --> 12:09.107
I was going over
the ropes with him.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.608
<i>Hi, guy.</i>

12:10.664 --> 12:12.200
White Deer has left.

12:12.266 --> 12:13.370
What do you mean, left?

12:13.434 --> 12:14.606
She quit.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.944
She was tired
of not getting paid.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.008
She left me
for a Portuguese restaurant.

12:20.074 --> 12:22.054
Who am I gonna use
in the act tomorrow?

12:22.176 --> 12:23.382
Tell me? Who?

12:23.444 --> 12:24.479
Don't you worry, Chief.

12:24.545 --> 12:27.253
We will find you another assistant.
I promise.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.056
Someone as fearless as White Deer?
Never.

12:32.253 --> 12:35.757
You've gotta forgive him. He's
had a rough couple of days.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.530
The police have really grilled
him on account of the fact

12:37.591 --> 12:39.867
that the murder weapon
was one of his knives.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.702
See, the case where he keeps
them was broken into.

12:43.564 --> 12:46.272
Of course, the weapon
didn't have his prints on it,

12:46.333 --> 12:49.837
but nevertheless, it's a
matter of pride with him.

12:49.904 --> 12:53.477
He swore he'd kill the person who did it.
I believe him.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.186
What exactly
does a roustabout do?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.651
Okay. Do you know
what a mop and broom are?

13:28.424 --> 13:29.835
<i>Somehow
it wasn't necessary</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:32.634
<i>to have a Tower Of Terror
to get good and scared.</i>

13:32.695 --> 13:34.868
<i>That's because most of the
people I talked to today</i>

13:34.931 --> 13:36.638
<i>were already
half there.</i>

13:43.840 --> 13:45.183
<i>Not me.</i>

13:53.149 --> 13:54.719
<i>Oh, I know
what you're thinking.</i>

13:54.784 --> 13:56.786
<i>That's because
I was thinking it, too.</i>

13:56.853 --> 13:59.390
<i>I was becoming
overly paranoid.</i>

13:59.455 --> 14:01.901
<i>After all, the Tower Of Terror
was nothing more</i>

14:01.958 --> 14:03.995
<i>than just a bunch
of papier-méché goblins</i>

14:04.060 --> 14:06.336
<i>and screech y
sound effects.</i>

14:06.429 --> 14:10.138
<i>Wouldn't have bothered
me nor Gramps one bit.</i>

14:14.070 --> 14:15.071
Boo!

14:21.144 --> 14:22.748
Easy, fella.

14:23.813 --> 14:26.555
Come on, I just work here.
Cleaning up.

14:30.553 --> 14:31.930
Damn rats.

14:32.355 --> 14:34.596
Scared you, didn't I?

14:34.724 --> 14:36.169
Scared me?

14:37.593 --> 14:38.697
Well, you woke me up.

14:38.761 --> 14:41.742
It's getting so a man can't get
a sound sleep around here.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.209
Excuse me.

14:51.441 --> 14:53.580
Who are you?

14:54.610 --> 14:55.748
Thomas Magnum.

14:55.812 --> 14:59.817
Inky hired me and a friend
of mine as roustabouts.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.020
Oh, he did, huh?

15:06.456 --> 15:08.902
The name's Gus Zimmer.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.666
Known professionally
as Gus the Geek.

15:13.029 --> 15:16.374
I'm sorry I frightened you.
Here, let me help you clean up.

15:16.432 --> 15:17.843
Oh, thanks.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.076
You done much
carnie work before?

15:22.205 --> 15:26.051
Well, I've done
a lot of mopping.

15:26.108 --> 15:28.110
Are you a Navy man?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.485
Yeah.

15:31.581 --> 15:34.494
I was in the Army myself,
about a million years ago.

15:34.584 --> 15:35.619
Hey, look,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.666
I know it's my job during
business hours and everything,

15:39.722 --> 15:42.430
but I really wasn't
trying to make you sick.

15:42.492 --> 15:46.201
It's just that it's the only place
where I can catch a few winks

15:46.262 --> 15:47.832
without people
bothering me,

15:47.897 --> 15:50.468
and I don't have to
wear the mask.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.605
And what with everything
that's been going on here,

15:53.669 --> 15:57.344
I guess I'm just as nervous
as everybody else.

15:57.406 --> 15:58.885
Robin?
Yeah.

15:58.975 --> 16:02.946
Surprised anybody took this
job knowing what's going on.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.286
It ain't only Robin, though.

16:06.415 --> 16:08.520
There's been other deaths?

16:09.085 --> 16:11.759
Did I say that?

16:11.821 --> 16:13.994
No, I didn't say that.

16:14.557 --> 16:19.438
I said there's been a lot of
bad stuff going on lately.

16:22.431 --> 16:25.503
That guy in San Diego
had his back broken

16:25.568 --> 16:29.072
when the whirl-a-way
collapsed on him.

16:29.138 --> 16:32.278
Darn thing had just passed
a safety inspection, too.

16:32.341 --> 16:35.686
Then our concession lady, Marge,
had to have her stomach pumped out

16:35.745 --> 16:38.316
when she ate
one of her own chili dogs.

16:38.381 --> 16:40.554
Somebody might have
put some

16:40.650 --> 16:43.654
arsenic into her chili.
She's gone.

16:43.853 --> 16:47.630
I'll tell you, life is tough
even if you don't weaken.

16:47.723 --> 16:52.468
I've been with this carnival for
30 years now and I've seen it all.

16:54.297 --> 16:57.278
I used to be the ringmaster
before the accident.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.506
I used to talk a lot.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.207
Now I don't get
to say much.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.844
All I get to do
is make a few weird noises.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.888
Three times a day.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.554
Gus the Geek.

17:16.586 --> 17:18.031
Subhuman.

17:21.223 --> 17:22.566
What happened?

17:23.159 --> 17:25.605
There was a fire
in Decatur, in '61.

17:25.661 --> 17:29.837
There were some kids.
I got them out.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.215
That was when
I got to be the Geek.

17:39.775 --> 17:42.051
Can't blame Inky any, though.

17:42.111 --> 17:43.681
He's always been
real good to me.

17:43.746 --> 17:45.885
He's kept me on here
through thick and thin,

17:45.948 --> 17:47.427
good times and bad,

17:47.483 --> 17:49.690
and I'd go right to the end
with him.

17:51.087 --> 17:53.863
I just hope it doesn't
come too soon.

17:53.923 --> 17:57.336
There's not much of a
retirement program for geeks.

18:00.129 --> 18:02.131
I'll get the rat.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.177
<i>Needless to say, I didn't
get a great night's sleep.</i>

18:14.243 --> 18:16.951
<i>Jumbled, distorted images
of devils with pitchforks</i>

18:17.013 --> 18:20.483
<i>and ugly green monsters and
chili dogs that came alive</i>

18:20.583 --> 18:23.257
<i>totally routed the poor little
sheep I was trying to count.</i>

18:23.319 --> 18:25.424
<i>They didn't have a chance.</i>

18:25.488 --> 18:28.435
<i>And with all the information
I had gotten yesterday,</i>

18:28.491 --> 18:32.234
<i>I was wondering if Inky
Gilbert's carnival did, either.</i>

18:39.068 --> 18:40.547
What time is it?

18:40.603 --> 18:43.209
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What's the matter with you?

18:43.305 --> 18:46.081
Matter? Matter?

18:46.842 --> 18:49.880
Nothing's the matter.
I love being scared awake.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.720
After all, we're
at a carnival, aren't we?

18:51.781 --> 18:54.523
There's nothing like a 6:00 a.m.
thrill to kick off the old adrenaline.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.654
What are you doing?

18:56.819 --> 18:58.389
I've been out all night
investigating

18:58.454 --> 18:59.626
while you've been sleeping.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.861
Well, you didn't have to clean out the
Tower of Terror or the Tunnel of Love.

19:02.925 --> 19:04.336
Do you want to know
what I found out or not?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.566
What did you find out?

19:06.629 --> 19:09.269
Nothing, but...
Nothing concrete.

19:09.331 --> 19:11.140
But I think
I'm onto something.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.612
It was that Indian Chief's knife
that was used in the murder, right?

19:14.103 --> 19:15.741
So I decided to
check him out.

19:15.805 --> 19:17.375
I followed him
all night long,

19:17.440 --> 19:19.010
because he was yelling
and screaming,

19:19.075 --> 19:22.056
and running inside and outside of
everybody's tents and trailers.

19:22.978 --> 19:25.254
And then he'd sneak up
behind some of the other guys

19:25.514 --> 19:27.255
and he'd just watch them.

19:27.316 --> 19:29.193
And then comes
the weird part.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.331
What weird part?

19:33.556 --> 19:36.264
It was a full moon
last night, right?

19:36.325 --> 19:39.363
This guy goes behind
the amusement park

19:39.428 --> 19:42.375
sits down on the grass,
looks up at the moon...

19:42.465 --> 19:45.344
Are you ready for this?
And starts singing opera.

19:45.468 --> 19:47.539
I'm convinced he's our guy.

19:48.003 --> 19:49.607
Because he was
singing opera?

19:50.473 --> 19:52.953
He was near the tent
when Robin Guthrie got it.

19:53.209 --> 19:54.916
Well, so were a dozen
other people.

19:54.977 --> 19:57.184
And they didn't see a thing. They
were too busy watching the stunt.

19:57.246 --> 20:00.022
Rick, just 'cause this guy
sings opera to the full moon

20:00.082 --> 20:01.857
doesn't mean
he's our killer.

20:02.718 --> 20:04.664
It's a lead.
What do you got?

20:04.754 --> 20:06.256
Nothing.
Oh.

20:06.722 --> 20:09.032
Except a lot of talk
about mysterious accidents.

20:09.091 --> 20:12.698
I mean, this is the worst kind of case, Rick.
There's nothing to go on.

20:12.762 --> 20:15.265
You just gotta... You gotta
kind of blend in

20:15.331 --> 20:17.368
and get familiar with people
till they trust you.

20:17.433 --> 20:21.347
And then, maybe then, somebody
will let something slip,

20:21.403 --> 20:23.110
and you got them.

20:23.405 --> 20:25.146
It's called deep cover.

20:25.207 --> 20:28.017
We could be here
for a long time.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.348
That's great.

20:29.411 --> 20:32.017
Except Inky Gilbert
doesn't have a long time.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.892
I know.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.687
What do you got in mind?

20:37.953 --> 20:42.925
Well, we accelerate the process.
We take control.

20:44.059 --> 20:45.333
HOW?

20:45.394 --> 20:48.739
No, wait a second.
Where are you going?

20:49.532 --> 20:52.445
We're history, Inky.
We're gone.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.640
No, no!

20:55.037 --> 20:58.109
No, No.
You can't leave, you can't.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.017
We are,
and you can't stop us.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.179
But why?

21:01.243 --> 21:03.018
Because we gotta eat.

21:03.112 --> 21:05.388
Yeah, and buy
some razor blades.

21:05.447 --> 21:08.553
But, guys,
what about the show?

21:08.617 --> 21:11.154
Chris, we're family.

21:11.287 --> 21:14.097
A broken family, Inky.

21:14.156 --> 21:16.329
I'll get the money,
I promise.

21:16.392 --> 21:18.065
It's not just the money.

21:18.127 --> 21:20.607
This carnival
isn't safe anymore.

21:20.663 --> 21:24.042
We don't want to go, but this
is the way it's gotta be.

21:24.099 --> 21:26.306
Goodbye, Inky.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.680
Please don't leave.
Chris, Charles.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.987
It won't be like Hackensack.

21:35.978 --> 21:38.151
There go
a lot of suspects, Thomas.

21:43.085 --> 21:45.087
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:45.154 --> 21:48.363
This is great, this is just great.
Hey, Gilbert.

21:56.098 --> 21:57.634
Mike Janes Amusements
has a contract

21:57.700 --> 21:59.373
with the Inky Gilbert
Carnival.

21:59.435 --> 22:01.437
Now, apparently,
there isn't one.

22:01.503 --> 22:03.107
The hell there isn't.

22:03.172 --> 22:04.378
How so?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.681
You just open the gates
at 11:00, Mr. Janes.

22:07.276 --> 22:09.813
The show will go on.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.721
This I gotta see.

23:06.168 --> 23:10.014
Is he a man
or is he an animal?

23:10.072 --> 23:13.417
A mere four bits will let
you decide for yourself.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.048
See the Geek
drink human blood.

23:17.112 --> 23:20.753
Will his animal thirst
ever be quenched?

23:20.816 --> 23:26.391
See what happens when live rodents
are unleashed in his cage.

23:26.522 --> 23:32.268
The Geek! The Geek! The Geek!
Come on.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.273
Step up, step up, step up.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.973
There's fun for everyone.

24:01.123 --> 24:02.761
I've had
enough of this.

24:02.825 --> 24:04.395
Come on, where's all
your carnie spirit?

24:04.460 --> 24:05.530
Where's your leads?

24:05.594 --> 24:07.369
And what about
accelerating the process?

24:07.429 --> 24:09.500
I have a new theory.
Yeah, what's that?

24:09.598 --> 24:12.841
The who-stands-to-gain the-most
if-Inky-goes-under theory.

24:12.935 --> 24:18.749
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We're saved!

24:18.807 --> 24:20.787
Daddy, what are you
talking about?

24:20.876 --> 24:24.346
The Inky Gilbert
Traveling Carnival lives!

24:24.413 --> 24:25.949
Daddy, I know we did well,

24:26.015 --> 24:28.859
but we can't keep up this kind of
effort unless we're at full strength.

24:28.917 --> 24:30.555
We are,
or we will be.

24:30.619 --> 24:32.724
After I hire everybody back
tomorrow morning.

24:32.788 --> 24:37.498
Ladies and gentlemen,
your paychecks.

24:46.035 --> 24:48.072
<i>So much
for my new theory.</i>

24:48.137 --> 24:50.617
<i>But out of its ashes
grew another.</i>

24:55.944 --> 24:59.050
<i>Admittedly, sneaking into the
office of your own client</i>

24:59.114 --> 25:02.687
<i>wasn't the most exemplary of
private investigative techniques.</i>

25:02.785 --> 25:04.492
<i>But then again,
when you're out of leads,</i>

25:04.553 --> 25:08.365
<i>being exemplary isn't as important
as getting to the truth.</i>

25:09.224 --> 25:11.329
<i>No matter where it may lie.</i>

25:19.301 --> 25:21.178
Hello, Magnum.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.952
Going through the books?

25:28.143 --> 25:29.986
I see you met Waldo.

25:30.045 --> 25:34.255
Say hello, Waldo.
"Hi, Magnum.

25:34.349 --> 25:36.226
"Find anything interesting?"

25:36.285 --> 25:38.026
Yes, I did.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.897
Let me guess.

25:41.924 --> 25:44.268
You couldn't find anything
concrete about Robin's murder,

25:44.326 --> 25:47.864
so your untrusting mind began
searching for other motives.

25:48.497 --> 25:51.239
The non-emotional kind,
the baser kind. Like

25:53.102 --> 25:54.547
economics.

25:55.404 --> 26:00.513
Sure, you'd heard about the accidents
and misfortunes I've been having.

26:00.576 --> 26:02.954
So you began
to wonder,

26:04.813 --> 26:08.090
"Hey, maybe old lnky's making
some dough on the deal.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.391
"He can't be making any money out
of this third-rate carnival.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.533
"Maybe he's trying to get it out
of the insurance companies.

26:17.226 --> 26:18.762
"How's he doing?"

26:18.827 --> 26:20.829
You're doing wonderfully.
Keep going.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.433
I will, son. I will.

26:24.032 --> 26:28.310
But here's where your suspicious
little mind and reality part company.

26:28.770 --> 26:32.047
I don't get a red cent
for any of those accidents.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.187
All I got
were higher premiums,

26:35.811 --> 26:37.984
substantially higher.

26:39.781 --> 26:42.352
I'm dying here, Magnum, and you're
trying to shovel dirt on the coffin

26:42.417 --> 26:44.090
before it's even
in the ground.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.559
It's good thinking, though.

26:48.490 --> 26:51.403
I've got to admire you
in a strange sort of way.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.531
Higgins was right.
He sent the best.

26:56.131 --> 26:59.078
He said that? The best?

26:59.334 --> 27:01.678
You gotta know
how to read him.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.205
Are you all finished here?

27:03.305 --> 27:08.846
So we can get some sleep and start
all over again tomorrow morning?

27:09.378 --> 27:10.550
Oh, just a minute.

27:10.612 --> 27:12.319
You can help me fix

27:12.381 --> 27:14.224
King Arthur's iron mace
in the Wax Museum.

27:14.349 --> 27:17.990
Just a second, Inky.
I'm not finished here yet.

27:18.053 --> 27:22.627
How about explaining the $10,000 cash
deposit in the carnival account?

27:25.794 --> 27:28.900
Maybe I've got
a silent partner.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.369
You're grasping
at straws, Magnum.

27:31.433 --> 27:34.073
And I guess I appreciate it,

27:35.804 --> 27:37.875
but where I got that money
is of no concern to you

27:37.940 --> 27:41.217
and has absolutely nothing to
do with Robin Guthrie's death.

27:42.377 --> 27:43.822
I promise.

27:52.187 --> 27:56.192
Oh, my God.
I'll call an ambulance.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.195
Rick?
Call the police.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.796
We should have
never come back.

27:59.861 --> 28:00.862
The Chief's dead.

28:00.963 --> 28:02.704
I think Rick's alive.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.440
Hey.

28:18.547 --> 28:22.723
My God, Magnum, you've got
the wrong bloody clown.

28:31.692 --> 28:33.194
- Rick?
- Rick?

28:33.661 --> 28:35.038
What?

28:36.931 --> 28:38.535
How do you feel?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.946
That's a dumb question.

28:42.002 --> 28:45.677
How would you feel if someone hit
you over the head with a hammer?

28:45.740 --> 28:47.515
I feel like garbage.

28:48.342 --> 28:50.185
Who's your friend?

28:50.845 --> 28:52.518
It's just Higgins.

28:52.580 --> 28:55.322
Did you get a look at the
guy who did this to you?

28:55.383 --> 28:57.294
No.

28:58.119 --> 29:00.725
I was following my suspect.

29:00.788 --> 29:01.960
The Chief?

29:02.056 --> 29:03.797
Yeah, the Chief.

29:03.891 --> 29:05.632
He was carrying
one of his knives

29:05.693 --> 29:07.934
and heading towards
the Wax Museum.

29:07.995 --> 29:10.066
So I followed him inside.

29:11.699 --> 29:14.111
It was all dark, and then...

29:14.168 --> 29:15.408
What?

29:16.237 --> 29:17.978
I don't know.

29:18.873 --> 29:20.750
What did you see?

29:21.575 --> 29:24.522
I saw a Fourth of July
fireworks show

29:25.279 --> 29:29.125
and a million little angels
singing in my head.

29:30.451 --> 29:33.625
And I guess
that's when he hit me.

29:33.687 --> 29:35.132
The Chief?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.802
Who else?

29:38.859 --> 29:40.770
Chief's dead, Rick.

29:42.830 --> 29:45.743
Oh. Good night.

29:54.909 --> 29:56.217
All right.

29:56.277 --> 29:57.722
Why were you there?

29:57.845 --> 29:59.882
And why are you dressed up
in this stupid suit?

29:59.947 --> 30:01.984
What I was doing there should
be obvious, even to you.

30:02.049 --> 30:04.495
I was attempting to assist.

30:04.552 --> 30:07.158
By lurking and skulking
in the shadows of the midway?

30:07.221 --> 30:08.461
That's my job.

30:08.522 --> 30:10.024
At which you were not being
entirely successful.

30:10.090 --> 30:12.127
Magnum, I was
only trying to help.

30:12.226 --> 30:13.227
I don't need your help.

30:13.294 --> 30:14.568
Inky Gilbert does.

30:14.662 --> 30:17.472
Oh, great. Coming from a guy
in a clown suit?

30:17.531 --> 30:19.477
Come on, Higgins,
I gotta do this my way.

30:19.533 --> 30:20.773
While the body count rises.

30:20.835 --> 30:21.870
Higgins.

30:21.936 --> 30:22.971
Obviously, the Chief had
a very strong notion

30:23.037 --> 30:25.108
of who Robin Guthrie's
murderer was.

30:25.172 --> 30:27.448
Well, I'm beginning to think
l do, too.

30:27.508 --> 30:28.748
Who?

30:29.376 --> 30:31.652
Possibly Inky Gilbert.

30:34.048 --> 30:37.393
That is the most baseless and absurd
statement I've ever heard you make.

30:37.451 --> 30:39.124
Rick was hit over the head.
What's your excuse?

30:39.186 --> 30:42.565
No excuses. Higgins, you've got
to consider the possibility.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.069
Look, before we found
Rick and the Chief,

30:45.125 --> 30:47.332
Inky caught me in his office
going through his books.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.839
You were what?

30:48.896 --> 30:51.172
Higgins, you look terrible.

30:51.232 --> 30:52.768
Why were you going through
lnky's books?

30:52.833 --> 30:54.210
I'll get to that.

30:54.268 --> 30:56.976
The point is that Inky walked
in with a big monkey wrench,

30:57.037 --> 30:59.017
a nice blunt instrument.

30:59.073 --> 31:02.316
He said he was doing some
repair work in the Wax Museum.

31:02.376 --> 31:05.289
So Inky killed the Chief and
attempted to do the same to Rick?

31:05.346 --> 31:07.849
That is conjecture at its most flimsy.
Indeed, libelous.

31:07.915 --> 31:09.553
Damn it, Higgins,
he had a motive.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.494
What motive?
Money.

31:11.552 --> 31:13.031
What, insurance?

31:13.087 --> 31:15.431
No, not insurance. He told
me the truth about that.

31:15.489 --> 31:17.093
But I found out
from lnky's books

31:17.157 --> 31:19.398
that if the carnival goes under,
there's a sweet buyout clause

31:19.460 --> 31:20.803
from Mike Janes
Amusements.

31:20.861 --> 31:23.364
Inky would never give up the carnival.
It's his...

31:23.430 --> 31:25.103
Life. Yeah, I know.

31:25.165 --> 31:28.112
Spare me that "one big
happy family" stuff.

31:29.870 --> 31:32.680
As of this moment,
you are off the case.

31:33.207 --> 31:34.709
No, I'm not.

31:41.582 --> 31:43.994
<i>What if they gave a
carnival and nobody came?</i>

31:44.051 --> 31:46.088
<i>I guess everybody moves on,</i>

31:46.153 --> 31:48.827
<i>leaving behind a lot of dreams
and illusions</i>

31:49.056 --> 31:50.535
<i>and sticky candy wrappers.</i>

31:50.591 --> 31:52.832
<i>But in this case
there's also left behind</i>

31:52.893 --> 31:54.998
<i>the rather sticky matter
of two dead bodies</i>

31:55.062 --> 31:57.133
<i>and one potentially
ruined friendship.</i>

31:57.197 --> 31:59.541
<i>But despite that,
I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

32:00.034 --> 32:03.174
Hey. That costs money, pal.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.349
But then, it's not gonna make
much difference, anyway.

32:10.411 --> 32:12.322
What do you mean?

32:14.548 --> 32:17.188
We'll all be gone soon.

32:30.564 --> 32:33.443
I think you just won
yourself a stuffed dinosaur.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.313
Hell, we're living in one.

32:37.371 --> 32:40.841
Inky wants to see you.
I'll take care of this here.

32:55.956 --> 32:57.299
Yeah?

33:00.794 --> 33:01.795
Oh.

33:04.164 --> 33:06.405
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to let you go, Magnum.

33:07.034 --> 33:09.742
We're closing tomorrow night.
Courtesy of Mr. Janes.

33:11.238 --> 33:12.774
I'm not a roustabout,
remember?

33:12.840 --> 33:16.811
I've got another job to do and
I'm not quite finished yet.

33:16.877 --> 33:18.823
Oh, yes, you are.

33:18.879 --> 33:22.486
Higgins called this morning.
This is per him.

33:22.549 --> 33:24.187
You're out of here
as of now.

33:24.251 --> 33:26.288
The police will continue
their investigation.

33:26.353 --> 33:27.696
And so will I.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.827
Not in my carnival.
Not while I still have it.

33:30.891 --> 33:32.666
Read the back of your ticket,

33:32.726 --> 33:35.798
the part where I've got the right
to refuse admission to anyone.

33:35.929 --> 33:37.909
It's not gonna be
that easy, Inky.

33:37.998 --> 33:39.568
My friend was hurt, too.

33:39.633 --> 33:40.976
Save me
the cheap melodramatics.

33:41.035 --> 33:43.345
I feel as bad
about Rick as you do.

33:45.205 --> 33:48.880
And I feel a whole lot worse
about Robin and the Chief,

33:51.412 --> 33:54.325
but this is the first fight
of my life I've ever lost.

33:54.481 --> 33:58.395
And the lousy thing about it is
I'm beginning to get used to it.

33:58.552 --> 34:01.158
I'm also beginning
to get used to the fact

34:01.221 --> 34:03.394
that these murders
were committed solely

34:03.457 --> 34:05.130
to drive me out of business.

34:05.192 --> 34:06.637
And if you were
such a great detective,

34:06.694 --> 34:09.572
perhaps that's where
you should've started,

34:10.764 --> 34:12.471
instead of me and my people.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.809
You're talking about Janes?

34:15.268 --> 34:16.475
I ain't naming names.

34:16.536 --> 34:19.484
I checked Janes out.
He's got an airtight alibi,

34:19.572 --> 34:22.018
and if you want to talk about
motive, he doesn't have one.

34:22.076 --> 34:24.989
He's gonna lose money
with this carnival.

34:25.045 --> 34:26.649
Just like me.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.427
Only I'm gonna
lose a lot more.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.797
Now get out of here, Magnum,

34:36.924 --> 34:40.996
there's enough buzzards
around and the air stinks.

34:44.565 --> 34:48.206
<i>A good friendship is usually
a difficult entity to maintain.</i>

34:48.768 --> 34:51.147
<i>There's got to be
a commonality of interests,</i>

34:51.205 --> 34:53.708
<i>an enjoyment
of each other's company,</i>

34:53.774 --> 34:56.152
<i>and an appreciation
of the other's differences.</i>

34:56.210 --> 34:59.191
<i>But if those items don't really
exist in large quantities,</i>

34:59.313 --> 35:02.954
<i>there has to be an underlying
basis of honesty and truth.</i>

35:03.083 --> 35:05.825
<i>But maybe this time
the truth was something</i>

35:05.886 --> 35:07.456
<i>Higgins didn't want to see</i>

35:07.521 --> 35:09.125
<i>because of his friendship
with Inky.</i>

35:09.189 --> 35:11.669
<i>But because of my
friendship with Higgins,</i>

35:11.725 --> 35:14.001
<i>it was something
he had to see.</i>

35:20.734 --> 35:22.372
Higgins.

35:24.638 --> 35:28.211
I want to apologize for yelling at
you last night at the hospital.

35:35.215 --> 35:38.219
I understand the bond
that you and Inky share,

35:38.752 --> 35:43.565
and I appreciate what it means, and
I appreciate your loyalty to him.

35:44.558 --> 35:47.300
Oh, yeah, I found out from a
friend of T.C.'s at the bank

35:47.361 --> 35:49.034
that the money that's
been keeping the carnival

35:49.096 --> 35:51.269
and Inky afloat's from you.

35:51.965 --> 35:55.412
Converted pounds sterling
from your British bank.

35:57.805 --> 35:59.546
But, Higgins.

35:59.606 --> 36:03.520
You can't judge a man
by one incident in his life.

36:03.577 --> 36:05.113
You have to look
at the whole picture,

36:05.179 --> 36:06.419
the essence of who he is.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.788
Now, damn it, Higgins,

36:07.848 --> 36:10.954
maybe Inky doesn't even want
your money, or my help,

36:11.018 --> 36:12.053
or the carnival's.

36:12.119 --> 36:13.291
Have you ever
considered that?

36:13.353 --> 36:15.424
Maybe all he wants
is out.

36:19.693 --> 36:23.038
All I'm saying is,
I think we should find out.

36:27.301 --> 36:30.714
Your passion for the truth
is commendable, Magnum.

36:31.805 --> 36:34.342
And, yes,
I do appreciate that.

36:35.509 --> 36:38.786
But, ultimately,
it is misguided.

36:38.846 --> 36:40.120
Why?

36:41.548 --> 36:47.157
Because Inky Gilbert was just found
strangled to death in his office.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.271
I'm sorry, Higgins.

36:59.215 --> 37:02.128
I know that doesn't mean
a whole lot right now.

37:02.251 --> 37:04.060
Magnum, your words
are unnecessary.

37:04.119 --> 37:06.292
I do understand
how you feel.

37:06.355 --> 37:07.663
Do you?

37:08.023 --> 37:11.436
Inky told me you said
you were sending him the best.

37:13.162 --> 37:15.403
Except maybe I should have
been a little quicker, too.

37:15.464 --> 37:18.274
At the moment, postmortems
and self-recrimination

37:18.334 --> 37:19.335
are irrelevant.

37:19.435 --> 37:21.415
This is not self-recrimination.
It's not a postmortem.

37:21.470 --> 37:22.642
It's finished.

37:22.705 --> 37:24.207
No, it isn't.

37:24.406 --> 37:27.910
Why go back? lnky's dead,
the carnival is over.

37:27.977 --> 37:29.320
I'm not going
to the carnival,

37:29.378 --> 37:32.018
not just yet.
But I am going back.

37:32.081 --> 37:33.424
Where?

37:33.549 --> 37:34.823
I'm going to the one place
and the one time

37:34.883 --> 37:38.228
you've never mentioned in all
your ramblings or your memoirs.

37:38.287 --> 37:40.494
North Africa, August of '42.

37:49.098 --> 37:51.578
Chris, Charles.

37:52.301 --> 37:53.507
Is Gus still around?

37:53.569 --> 37:55.139
Where is he gonna go?

37:55.204 --> 37:56.774
Gus is inside.

37:57.373 --> 37:59.751
Thanks. Good luck.

38:00.709 --> 38:01.949
Thanks.

38:06.715 --> 38:08.888
<i>There's something
disturbing and sad</i>

38:08.951 --> 38:11.488
<i>when you see something
out of its normal element.</i>

38:11.553 --> 38:13.794
<i>Like a fish helplessly thrashing
on the deck of a boat,</i>

38:14.323 --> 38:17.861
<i>or those carnies who have no idea
that there's another world out there,</i>

38:17.960 --> 38:20.873
<i>or much less have
the ability to cope in it.</i>

38:25.601 --> 38:28.343
<i>But at least
they made the choice.</i>

38:28.404 --> 38:32.682
<i>Somehow, I had the feeling that Gus
Zimmer didn't have those kind of options.</i>

38:56.699 --> 38:58.508
<i>And when you're
out of options,</i>

38:58.567 --> 39:01.707
<i>you can either cry for help,
or blow sky high.</i>

39:02.871 --> 39:05.112
<i>Maybe I should have heard
Gus's cry for help,</i>

39:05.174 --> 39:06.710
<i>but there were
so many other voices.</i>

39:06.775 --> 39:09.688
<i>Inky's, Higgins', the Chief's,
Mike Janes', Audrey's.</i>

39:10.879 --> 39:12.916
<i>But I was listening now.</i>

39:12.981 --> 39:16.588
<i>I only hoped
it wasn't too late.</i>

39:18.554 --> 39:20.397
Are you looking
for something?

39:22.424 --> 39:23.903
Not anymore.

39:24.593 --> 39:26.595
I found
what I'm looking for.

39:26.662 --> 39:28.505
You're in my stuff.

39:28.630 --> 39:31.167
Yeah, I was, Donald.

39:32.101 --> 39:33.705
The name's Gus.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.616
Not 44 years ago, it wasn't.

39:36.672 --> 39:38.982
Forty-four years ago
in North Africa,

39:39.041 --> 39:40.748
it was Donald.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.119
When you and your brother were
fighting next to an Englishman

39:43.178 --> 39:45.590
named Jonathan Quayle Higgins.
That's where you got burned.

39:46.982 --> 39:49.155
There was no fire in Decatur,
no kids.

39:49.852 --> 39:51.854
The hell there wasn't.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.298
The firemen gave me
a commendation.

39:54.356 --> 39:55.892
It's right here somewhere.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.370
Oh, I don't think so.

39:58.460 --> 40:01.441
Probably some kind
of clerical error, right?

40:01.497 --> 40:04.774
Some harried medic buries the
real Gus Zimmer under your name.

40:04.867 --> 40:07.507
The name that's on this
Purple Heart, your dog tags.

40:08.837 --> 40:10.714
Donald Gilbert.

40:13.008 --> 40:14.817
Why'd you do it?

40:15.010 --> 40:16.216
Why?

40:18.514 --> 40:20.824
You're asking me why?

40:26.422 --> 40:29.301
There's enough light here.
Take a good look.

40:32.961 --> 40:36.568
I had a fiancée and a job
to come back to.

40:36.632 --> 40:38.703
When I took the bandages off
and looked in the mirror,

40:38.767 --> 40:42.146
I knew it was
never gonna happen.

40:42.204 --> 40:44.548
I didn't want
to put anyone through

40:44.606 --> 40:47.052
the grief of having to
look at me and smile

40:47.109 --> 40:52.491
and try to be brave and try to keep
from throwing up at the same time.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.261
So it turned out to be
a whole lot better for me

40:57.319 --> 40:59.765
just to be Gus Zimmer.

41:00.823 --> 41:04.635
No hassles. No pity. Just a bunch
of sawdust and cheap laughs.

41:09.932 --> 41:13.539
You should've seen
the look on lnky's face

41:13.602 --> 41:16.378
when I showed up
a few years later.

41:16.605 --> 41:19.518
Back from the dead.

41:20.709 --> 41:24.020
I'll say this for him, though,
he was a good brother.

41:24.079 --> 41:27.060
He took care of me.
No questions asked.

41:27.115 --> 41:29.220
Then why'd you kill him?

41:31.186 --> 41:33.393
Who says I killed him?

41:33.455 --> 41:36.629
The buyout clause in lnky's contract
with Mike Janes Amusements.

41:36.692 --> 41:39.002
Gus Zimmer gets the payoff in
the event of lnky's death.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.938
You're the silent partner.

41:46.535 --> 41:48.947
Now, what would a geek
want with money?

41:50.873 --> 41:52.375
Well,

41:52.875 --> 41:56.084
maybe some kind
of real life.

41:56.144 --> 41:58.954
Some kind of life where you
don't have to drool and moan

41:59.014 --> 42:01.620
and chase live rats around
three times a day.

42:02.484 --> 42:04.691
Some kind of life where you can
rent an apartment, watch TV,

42:04.753 --> 42:07.256
pretend you're just like
everybody else.

42:09.191 --> 42:11.398
You wanted out, Donald.

42:11.460 --> 42:14.873
You started with the accidents,
trying to get Inky to sell.

42:14.997 --> 42:17.603
But Inky was tough,
and you escalated.

42:19.601 --> 42:21.740
You didn't have to kill.

42:21.803 --> 42:23.783
How do you know that?

42:26.575 --> 42:29.351
You're a pretty good guesser,

42:29.411 --> 42:32.255
but you don't know
what it's really like.

42:32.314 --> 42:34.555
And unless you swallow
a bucketful of fire

42:34.616 --> 42:38.359
trying to save some berserk
lunatic someday, you never will.

42:40.589 --> 42:42.125
What are you saying?
Higgins?

42:42.190 --> 42:44.830
No, not Higgins.
My brother, Inky.

42:45.294 --> 42:46.967
He snapped.

42:47.162 --> 42:50.439
He was too tired or too crazy,
I don't know. But he snapped.

42:50.499 --> 42:53.810
He took off running straight
at an enemy machine-gun nest.

42:53.902 --> 42:56.314
Blazing away,
and I had to get him out.

42:56.371 --> 43:00.478
But instead of him ending up
the dead hero, I got to be it.

43:01.209 --> 43:02.882
Where was Higgins?

43:03.445 --> 43:06.426
He was holding his position.
He was following orders.

43:06.481 --> 43:08.927
He was doing exactly
what he was supposed to do.

43:09.117 --> 43:11.290
Maybe he doesn't think so.

43:11.353 --> 43:15.233
Who cares? It doesn't matter anymore.
It's over.

43:15.324 --> 43:17.133
It's all over now.

43:20.429 --> 43:23.376
Tell me something.
How did you get a fix on me?

43:23.432 --> 43:26.174
Was it the buyout clause?

43:27.002 --> 43:28.606
No.

43:28.670 --> 43:31.583
I don't know, you just shot
that rifle too damn good.

43:35.877 --> 43:37.914
Come on, let's go.

43:39.948 --> 43:41.256
Where?

43:42.117 --> 43:43.619
Find some people
who can help you.

43:46.788 --> 43:48.290
Me included.

43:49.424 --> 43:51.370
Thomas.

43:51.460 --> 43:53.167
Don't. Stay right there.

43:55.631 --> 43:58.737
I may be ugly,
I may be crazy,

43:59.501 --> 44:02.812
but I'm not going
to no hospital.

44:07.009 --> 44:08.716
Where are you going?

44:08.844 --> 44:10.380
France.

44:13.682 --> 44:16.720
One million dollars and a
plane to France? That guy is crazy.

44:16.785 --> 44:18.025
We'll just extradite him.

44:18.186 --> 44:20.598
I know that. And more
importantly, he knows that.

44:20.689 --> 44:22.293
But you gotta
go through the motions.

44:22.357 --> 44:24.064
The man has
nothing to lose.

44:24.126 --> 44:25.901
That's impossible.
I'm moving in.

44:25.961 --> 44:28.305
You move in,
and he kills Audrey Gilbert.

44:28.363 --> 44:31.037
Now, look, he gave you
an hour. Give me 10 minutes.

44:32.167 --> 44:33.703
I can't.
You know that.

44:33.769 --> 44:36.477
I know that place.
I've cleaned it often enough.

44:37.539 --> 44:39.177
Let me try, please.

44:41.710 --> 44:44.350
I gotta look over the
blueprints of the building.

44:45.447 --> 44:46.983
Talk to me in 15 minutes.

44:49.818 --> 44:51.559
Magnum.

44:55.057 --> 44:56.798
What is the status
of the operation?

44:56.858 --> 44:58.064
The status is I'm gonna
go in there

44:58.126 --> 44:59.127
and try and get Audrey out.

44:59.194 --> 45:00.400
I'm going with you.
No.

45:00.462 --> 45:02.601
I must.
Please understand, Magnum.

45:02.664 --> 45:04.575
I have my reasons.

45:05.617 --> 45:09.565
I know what they are, Higgins.
And I do understand.

45:12.247 --> 45:14.955
You did the right thing
44 years ago.

45:17.996 --> 45:20.067
Do the right thing now.

45:36.548 --> 45:39.188
Please, please,
give me the gun.

45:39.284 --> 45:41.696
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.197
Why are you doing this?

45:43.255 --> 45:46.498
'Cause I want people
to remember who I was.

45:47.025 --> 45:49.266
Let her go, Donald.

45:51.663 --> 45:52.835
Come on.

45:53.632 --> 45:57.136
Sure. No problem.
Go ahead.

46:03.942 --> 46:06.548
Why don't you just
put that gun away?

46:15.687 --> 46:16.859
No!

46:16.922 --> 46:19.698
I never wanted
to go to France, anyway.

46:25.964 --> 46:28.205
The front,
run to the front!

46:29.868 --> 46:31.279
Donald!

46:36.007 --> 46:37.042
Why?

46:37.108 --> 46:39.088
For all of us, come.

46:53.291 --> 46:54.599
Magnum.

46:55.026 --> 46:56.505
Higgins.
