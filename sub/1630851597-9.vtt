00:09.409 --> 00:12.746
- Nanny, there's a

00:09.409 --> 00:12.746
weird-looking package in here.

00:12.778 --> 00:14.913
- Mama, come on.

00:12.778 --> 00:14.913
Let's go to lunch.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.716

00:14.948 --> 00:16.716
I'm trying to get ready.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.751
- What the hell is that?

00:18.785 --> 00:19.919
- It looks quite interesting.

00:19.952 --> 00:22.121
- [chuckles]

00:19.952 --> 00:22.121
- That is a package.

00:22.155 --> 00:25.457
- No kidding.

00:22.155 --> 00:25.457
- No, that is a "package."

00:25.492 --> 00:27.126
- A "package."

00:29.949 --> 00:30.696
- You think it vibrates?

00:30.730 --> 00:32.164
- Elliott!

00:32.198 --> 00:34.768
Look at that precious angel.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.703
- Hey, Nanny. How you doing?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.703
- Good to see you.

00:36.735 --> 00:38.570
- What you got coming

00:36.735 --> 00:38.570
through the mail right here?

00:38.604 --> 00:40.240
We're kind of confused.

00:38.604 --> 00:40.240
- Oh, that's package.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.274
Now I can open it.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.274
- No, don't open it.

00:42.307 --> 00:43.542
Don't open it.

00:42.307 --> 00:43.542
- No, we're good.

00:43.576 --> 00:46.460
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:43.576 --> 00:46.460
- She's a grown woman.

00:46.789 --> 00:47.546
She's allowed to have

00:46.789 --> 00:47.546
her private time.

00:47.579 --> 00:48.781
- Elliott!

00:47.579 --> 00:48.781
- What?

00:48.814 --> 00:50.149
- Get your mind

00:48.814 --> 00:50.149
out of the gutter.

00:50.182 --> 00:52.284
It's a Lint Lizard.

00:52.317 --> 00:53.585
- A what?

00:53.619 --> 00:56.555
- You attach this

00:53.619 --> 00:56.555
to your vacuum.

00:56.588 --> 00:59.125
It cleans the lint

00:56.588 --> 00:59.125
out of your dryer.

00:59.158 --> 01:00.460

00:59.158 --> 01:00.460

pervertedest bunch of people.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.195
- Me?

01:02.228 --> 01:04.831
You're the one thinking you've

01:02.228 --> 01:04.831
got a sex toy over there.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.432
- Why would I use a sex toy

01:06.465 --> 01:08.134
when there are

01:06.465 --> 01:08.134
plenty of men available?

01:08.168 --> 01:10.537

01:34.561 --> 01:36.960
Easter is a great time of year,

01:34.561 --> 01:36.960
isn't it?

01:36.960 --> 01:37.629
- I just hope this is

01:36.960 --> 01:37.629
the one time of year

01:37.664 --> 01:39.990
Elliott doesn't hit on me.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.433
- I mean, maybe

01:39.990 --> 01:41.433
if you weren't so beautiful.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.375
for the Easter egg hunt?

01:46.639 --> 01:48.375
- Yeah.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.944
- Well, you're lucky to have me

01:48.408 --> 01:50.944
as your older brother,

01:50.977 --> 01:53.813
because I am the best

01:50.977 --> 01:53.813
at finding the eggs.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.882
- No, I'm pretty sure

01:53.847 --> 01:55.882
I found the golden egg

01:55.914 --> 01:56.983
almost every year.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.151
- What's in the golden egg?

01:58.183 --> 01:59.352
- Money.

01:58.183 --> 01:59.352
- A lot of money.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.120
- It's the best time of year

01:59.385 --> 02:01.120
to get paid.

02:01.153 --> 02:03.156
- One year, I walked away

02:01.153 --> 02:03.156
with a golden egg,

02:03.188 --> 02:04.724
and guess how much money

02:03.188 --> 02:04.724
was in there?

02:04.757 --> 02:05.858
- How much?

02:05.891 --> 02:07.760
- $200.

02:07.793 --> 02:09.162
- Wait, what?

02:09.194 --> 02:10.629
- Every year,

02:09.194 --> 02:10.629
our family participates

02:10.663 --> 02:12.231
in a community Easter egg hunt.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.669
And I've always wanted

02:12.264 --> 02:14.669
to win it,

02:14.099 --> 02:15.568
always, 'cause

02:14.099 --> 02:15.568
I'm very competitive,

02:15.602 --> 02:18.710
but I just fell short

02:15.602 --> 02:18.710
a couple times.

02:18.103 --> 02:20.606
- What, like 5'7" short?

02:20.639 --> 02:22.108
- Shut up!

02:22.141 --> 02:23.575
I am 5'10"!

02:25.211 --> 02:26.378
doesn't mean you are.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.480
My driver's license

02:26.413 --> 02:28.480
says I'm 125 pounds.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.115
We know that's a lie.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.350

- I haven't found

- Well, Chloe, you are

02:34.721 --> 02:36.456
gonna find it this year.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.909
I promise you that.

show you the art of the hunt.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.361

02:40.159 --> 02:42.361
get you a bigger Easter basket

were as good

03:13.460 --> 03:15.495

our day's already planned

03:51.764 --> 03:53.265
for tomorrow.

very,

04:14.653 --> 04:16.560

Like, 95% of the time,

04:20.326 --> 04:22.696
it's Savannah,

04:22.728 --> 04:25.649
but I do get in there,

04:22.728 --> 04:25.649
like, 5% of the time.

04:25.649 --> 04:26.199
- I mean, there's nothing wrong

04:26.231 --> 04:27.600
with spending time

04:26.231 --> 04:27.600
with your family,

04:27.634 --> 04:29.903
but it's also healthy

04:29.935 --> 04:32.439
to kind of have

04:29.935 --> 04:32.439
your own social circle

04:32.471 --> 04:34.206
outside of the crazies

04:32.471 --> 04:34.206

04:34.240 --> 04:35.675
- Friends.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.675
- Yeah.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.110
- That you're not related to.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.110
- What he just said.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.180
He doesn't like to be alone.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.781
- Okay.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.781
And that's only half-true.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.983
Most of the time,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.983
I love my own company.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.620
- You'll be fine alone, Todd.

04:56.862 --> 04:58.697

04:56.862 --> 04:58.697
looks pretty great.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.660
- Dude, it does look great.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.935

05:00.100 --> 05:02.935
for me when I was a kid.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.572
I hated not finding the

05:03.360 --> 05:05.572
golden egg when I was a kid.

05:05.605 --> 05:06.839
And I'm here to make sure

05:06.872 --> 05:08.608
that Chloe doesn't have

05:06.872 --> 05:08.608
to go through that,

05:08.641 --> 05:11.577
and that's why I've created an

05:08.641 --> 05:11.577
obstacle course so she's ready.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.278
- Oh, my gosh.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.278
- Chloe!

05:13.312 --> 05:15.415
What do you think?

05:13.312 --> 05:15.415
- It's amazing.

05:15.447 --> 05:17.684
- But what does it have to do

05:15.447 --> 05:17.684
with an Easter egg hunt?

05:17.716 --> 05:19.819
- Savannah, there is method

05:17.716 --> 05:19.819
to this madness.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.154
To find the golden egg,

05:19.853 --> 05:22.154
she's gonna need speed,

05:22.187 --> 05:23.423
agility, and endurance.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.324
And this course is gonna

05:23.456 --> 05:25.324
help her with that.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.692
So by the time

05:25.358 --> 05:26.692
Easter rolls around,

05:26.725 --> 05:28.427
she's gonna be

05:26.725 --> 05:28.427
an egg-hunting machine.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.297
- Well, you've got

05:28.461 --> 05:31.297
the madness part, all right.

05:33.659 --> 05:35.802
- Listen, Chloe,

05:33.659 --> 05:35.802
you gotta go in there and win.

05:35.834 --> 05:36.935
- Yeah.

05:35.834 --> 05:36.935
- We never lose.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.137
So when you're going to this,

05:38.170 --> 05:40.606
you got to dodge

05:38.170 --> 05:40.606
these obstacles, all right?

05:40.639 --> 05:42.641
- And then, if anyone gets

05:40.639 --> 05:42.641
in your way, you got to kick.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.610
You got to punch.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.610
Kick them to the ground.

05:44.644 --> 05:45.812
- We don't do that.

05:44.644 --> 05:45.812
- No!

05:45.845 --> 05:47.947
- But y'all know

05:45.845 --> 05:47.947
what actually helps a kid?

05:47.980 --> 05:50.216
- What?

05:47.980 --> 05:50.216
- Seeing it go down.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.185
Y'all two should do it.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.185
- Well, we can do that, Chloe.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.254
We'll run through it right now

05:52.218 --> 05:54.254
so you can see it.

05:54.286 --> 05:55.387
- Go.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.899
- You're gonna jump, jump.

05:57.122 --> 05:58.725
Hop, hop, hop, hop.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.795
Then, this, this, this, this.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.795
Boom, boom.

06:01.827 --> 06:03.495
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

06:01.827 --> 06:03.495
- Let's go.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.533
- Obviously, you'll look

06:03.529 --> 06:06.533
more graceful doing it.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.435
- Yeah.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.435
- I'm getting old.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.668
- Right now,

06:08.468 --> 06:09.668
they're showing you

06:09.702 --> 06:11.204
what you don't want to do,

06:09.702 --> 06:11.204
Chloe.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.389
- He's not going to fit.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.389
- Oh, [bleep].

06:13.730 --> 06:14.399
- He's not going to fit.

06:14.740 --> 06:15.750
Is he stuck?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.209
- Oh, my gosh.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.511
- Then, you go over.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.612
Don't do that.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.548
Grab your golden egg.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.548
- Got it.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.115
- Then, you're going over.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.418
- Oh!

06:23.149 --> 06:25.418
- [laughs] Oh, yeah.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.153
- Yeah, Chloe, you can go

06:25.451 --> 06:27.153
way faster than them.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.687
- I think you can do it

06:27.187 --> 06:28.687
better than us.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.889
Are you ready?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.889
- Yeah.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.324
- Are you sure?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.324
- Yeah!

06:31.358 --> 06:33.692
- One, two...

06:31.358 --> 06:33.692
- One, two, three, go!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.261
- Here we go!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.261
- Come on, Chloe!

06:35.295 --> 06:37.129
- There we go! There we go!

06:35.295 --> 06:37.129
There we go! There we go!

06:37.163 --> 06:38.163
- There it is.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.163
Like a bunny.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.298
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

06:39.331 --> 06:40.933
This is what

06:39.331 --> 06:40.933
I'm talking about, Chloe.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.668
You're gonna crush

06:40.966 --> 06:42.668
the competition.

06:42.701 --> 06:43.903
- Crush it.

06:42.701 --> 06:43.903
- Under there fast!

06:43.937 --> 06:46.338
Go! Go!

06:43.937 --> 06:46.338
- Come on, Chloe.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.906
Elliott won't stop

06:46.372 --> 06:47.906
flirting with me!

06:47.941 --> 06:50.175
The faster you finish,

06:47.941 --> 06:50.175
the faster he stops.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.745
- Take your time, Chloe.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.745
It's okay. No rush.

06:52.778 --> 06:54.146
- Yeah!

06:52.778 --> 06:54.146
[cheering]

06:54.180 --> 06:55.882
- This is it, Chloe.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.882
This is what you need

06:55.915 --> 06:57.149
in order

06:55.915 --> 06:57.149
to win the competition.

06:57.182 --> 06:59.519
Golden egg! Golden egg!

06:57.182 --> 06:59.519
- Golden egg, baby!

06:59.552 --> 07:01.254
- Let's go! Yes! Yes!

06:59.552 --> 07:01.254
- Come on!

07:01.286 --> 07:02.454
- Let's go!

07:01.286 --> 07:02.454
- Whoo!

07:02.488 --> 07:03.723
[cheering]

07:03.757 --> 07:05.524
- The eye of the tiger.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.524
- Eye of the tiger.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.459
- The eye of the tiger!

07:05.557 --> 07:07.459
- Eye of the tiger!

07:07.494 --> 07:09.161
- Snap!

07:07.494 --> 07:09.161
[grunts]

07:09.194 --> 07:10.529
- Oh, wow.

07:10.562 --> 07:12.432
- You did it! Good job.

07:10.562 --> 07:12.432
- Whoo!

07:12.464 --> 07:14.339
- Chloe, you're getting

07:12.464 --> 07:14.339
the golden egg.

07:14.339 --> 07:16.201
- That golden egg is mine.

07:14.339 --> 07:16.201
- Yes, ma'am.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.379
Good job.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.379
- Way to go!

07:23.475 --> 07:26.459
<i>[whimsical music]</i>

07:26.312 --> 07:27.413
<i>* *</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:29.915
- Chase, are you

07:27.447 --> 07:29.915
in a bad mood today?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.184
- No, I've just

07:29.949 --> 07:31.184
got a bet going.

07:31.216 --> 07:32.718
I got money on the Braves.

07:31.216 --> 07:32.718
- Oh.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.821
Well, I bet on the Braves

07:32.752 --> 07:34.821
one time.

07:34.853 --> 07:37.569
And I won 16 in a row.

07:37.899 --> 07:39.558
- 16 in a row?

07:37.899 --> 07:39.558
- 16 in a row.

07:39.591 --> 07:41.610
And it was so good

07:41.610 --> 07:44.697
that I didn't even

07:41.610 --> 07:44.697
change my panties.

07:44.730 --> 07:45.932
- Nanny!

07:45.965 --> 07:48.668
- You don't ever eff

07:45.965 --> 07:48.668
with a streak.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.699
- [chuckles]

07:50.103 --> 07:52.237
No, Nanny, you don't.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.237
- You know what I mean.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.473
- You don't.

07:53.505 --> 07:56.576
Is that my dad?

07:53.505 --> 07:56.576
- Get away from him.

07:56.608 --> 07:59.913
- Go. Go. Go. Go.

07:56.608 --> 07:59.913
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

08:00.129 --> 08:01.447
I don't think he saw us.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.550
Turn it in here.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.151
What does he want?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.353
- Your daddy's

08:05.185 --> 08:06.353
wanting me to go

08:06.386 --> 08:08.721
to some development meeting

08:06.386 --> 08:08.721
with him.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.910
- Oh, my God.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.910
I'm not going.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.759
- Well, you his son.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.759
- And you're his mama!

08:13.793 --> 08:15.928
- I know, but you're younger.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.928
- Pull over.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.930
We need to wait

08:16.290 --> 08:17.930
until he leaves.

08:18.310 --> 08:19.432
This whole situation

08:18.310 --> 08:19.432
with my dad

08:19.466 --> 08:20.733
has gotten completely

08:19.466 --> 08:20.733
out of hand.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.401
I mean, he cannot

08:20.766 --> 08:22.401
just expect us

08:22.435 --> 08:23.702
to drop all of our plans

08:23.737 --> 08:25.504
to accommodate

08:23.737 --> 08:25.504
what he wants to do.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.273
So we gotta find a solution.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.841
- I love my son,

08:28.875 --> 08:31.769
but he needs some new friends,

08:31.110 --> 08:32.879
'cause mama's too old for this.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.414
- Yeah. Preach.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.250
Do you think

08:35.447 --> 08:37.250
we waited long enough?

08:37.283 --> 08:39.918
- I don't see him.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.918
Maybe he went home.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.423
Well, maybe we lost him.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.825
- I think we did.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.825
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.192
'Cause I'm not going anyway.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.662
[car horn honks]

08:47.226 --> 08:49.662
Oh, God.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.963
[laughs]

08:51.639 --> 08:53.659
- What are y'all up here doing?

08:53.990 --> 08:54.900
Just the two people

08:53.990 --> 08:54.900
I wanted to see.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.469
Y'all come on.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.469
Go with me.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.203
- We're going in

08:56.503 --> 08:58.203
to the watch a ball game.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.306
- You don't need to do that.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.306
Y'all come with me.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.674
- I wanted to hang out

09:00.340 --> 09:01.674
with him.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.643
- I know, Mama, but

09:01.707 --> 09:03.643
you need to hang out with me.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.211
It's very important.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.211
- What we got going on?

09:06.245 --> 09:07.379
- Lunch.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.490
- We already ate.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.383
- Yeah, but I can't sit

09:09.820 --> 09:10.383
by myself.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.152
- Come on, Nanny, let's go.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.152
- Oh, God almighty.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.720
Damn!

09:12.184 --> 09:13.720
- Here.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.422
- Damn!

09:13.753 --> 09:15.422
You always got to go.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.923
- He's always gotta screw

09:15.455 --> 09:17.923
something up, doesn't he?

09:18.240 --> 09:19.192
- Come on, Mama.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.192
- Always.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.693
Always. Always.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.289
- Y'all wait until I tell you

09:20.726 --> 09:23.289
about this business meeting.

09:23.629 --> 09:24.297
- Yeah, better than baseball.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.166
- If I ain't been with him

09:24.330 --> 09:26.166
all his life,

09:26.198 --> 09:28.567
I wouldn't do this sh--stuff.

09:32.138 --> 09:35.409
- Eggs!

09:35.750 --> 09:36.643
- Aren't you done

09:35.750 --> 09:36.643
with this yet?

09:36.676 --> 09:38.878
- I'm looking for eggs so I can

09:36.676 --> 09:38.878
win the golden egg money.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.447
- Those are socks.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.682
- Grayson, this is training,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.682
don't you know?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.484
- No, I don't know

09:42.716 --> 09:44.484
why Chase and Savannah

09:44.517 --> 09:46.318
are making you do this.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.318
It's dumb.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.620
- Why are all of my socks

09:46.352 --> 09:48.620
all over the house

09:48.654 --> 09:51.323
and the upstairs looks like

09:48.654 --> 09:51.323
a tornado's gone through it?

09:51.357 --> 09:53.590
- I need to find

09:51.357 --> 09:53.590
a golden egg.

09:53.590 --> 09:55.128
- Who told you

09:53.590 --> 09:55.128
about a golden egg?

09:55.161 --> 09:57.629
- Chase and Savannah say

09:55.161 --> 09:57.629
I need to train.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.198
- Okay.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.198
What is she talking about?

09:59.231 --> 10:01.467
- So you know how the big

09:59.231 --> 10:01.467
Easter egg hunt is coming up?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.135
- Yes.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.135
- Chase, Elliott, and Savannah

10:03.168 --> 10:04.604
are putting her

10:03.168 --> 10:04.604
through a trial run,

10:04.636 --> 10:06.740
trying to get her

10:04.636 --> 10:06.740
to find the golden egg faster.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.173
- Get up!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.173
Get up!

10:08.207 --> 10:09.708
- Chloe, listen to me.

10:09.743 --> 10:13.446
Chloe, Easter is not

10:09.743 --> 10:13.446
about finding a golden egg.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.750
Easter is about recognizing

10:13.480 --> 10:16.750
that Jesus rose again.

10:16.783 --> 10:20.220
So the hunt is just supposed

10:16.783 --> 10:20.220
to be for fun.

10:20.253 --> 10:24.224
Trust, Tweedledee,

10:20.253 --> 10:24.224
Tweedledum, and Tweedledumber

10:24.256 --> 10:26.860
to give Chloe

10:24.256 --> 10:26.860
the wrong meaning of Easter.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.794
The egg hunt is

10:26.893 --> 10:28.794
a fun side dish.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.296
It's not the main course.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.264
- I would like to say

10:30.330 --> 10:32.264
that I'm surprised,

10:32.298 --> 10:34.100
but I'm not because

10:32.298 --> 10:34.100
Chase and Savannah

10:34.134 --> 10:36.568
have never been able

10:34.134 --> 10:36.568
to control themselves

10:36.602 --> 10:38.571
when it comes to competition,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.874
and especially

10:38.605 --> 10:40.874
when there's prizes involved.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.809
- And then, you add Elliott

10:40.907 --> 10:43.809
in the mix to egg them on.

10:43.842 --> 10:47.212
- And that's never going

10:43.842 --> 10:47.212
to be a good situation.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.783
- And just so you know,

10:47.246 --> 10:49.783
I'm not upset with you.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.750
Am I ever upset with you?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.750
- No, sir.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.951
- Okay.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.854
I will deal with

10:52.985 --> 10:54.854
those other three heathens.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.955
You don't worry about it.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.240
You come give me a hug.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.393
I love you, darling.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.696
You remember that, okay?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.696
- Okay.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.764
- Grayson, get this stuff

11:02.729 --> 11:04.764
cleaned up for her.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.932
- I didn't even do anything.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.299
- Bye-bye.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.299
Have fun.

11:17.769 --> 11:20.647
you can smell 'em.

- Hey, buddy.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.629

11:35.528 --> 11:37.629
- And you can smell it too.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.198
- I thought

11:37.663 --> 11:39.198
that was Chase at first,

11:39.231 --> 11:40.966
but it must be the wings.

Okay.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.903
- Well, Jay, thank you

11:42.668 --> 11:44.903
for meeting us for lunch

11:44.937 --> 11:47.106
because we actually need

11:44.937 --> 11:47.106
your help with something.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.807
- Oh, so y'all didn't want

11:47.106 --> 11:48.807
to spend time with me.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.443
You're here to use me?

11:48.841 --> 11:51.443
- Yeah, exactly.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.980
- I don't think that's the

11:51.477 --> 11:53.980
meaning of friendship, guys.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.316
But I'm happy to help.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.317
- Jay's gonna be our savior,

11:58.350 --> 12:00.529
just like little baby Jesus.

12:00.529 --> 12:02.355
- Yeah, well,

12:00.529 --> 12:02.355
that's the hope anyways.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.623
- What's going on?

12:03.655 --> 12:06.725
- Well, I need for my son

12:03.655 --> 12:06.725
to find some friends.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.595
- He's just driving us

12:06.759 --> 12:08.595
up a wall.

12:08.628 --> 12:12.197
I mean, it's like he can't

12:08.628 --> 12:12.197
do anything by himself.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.500
And he's either blowing me up,

12:12.231 --> 12:14.500
blowing her up,

12:14.533 --> 12:15.902
Savannah, or my mom,

12:15.934 --> 12:19.720
and we just want him

12:15.934 --> 12:19.720
to kind of find somebody else.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.306
- What's wrong with you?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.750
Why don't you want

12:20.340 --> 12:22.750
to hang out with your daddy?

12:22.750 --> 12:23.643
- Well, I like

12:22.750 --> 12:23.643
hanging out with him,

12:23.677 --> 12:25.144
but, I mean, enough is enough.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.647
And I don't want to go do what

12:25.177 --> 12:27.647
he wants to do all the time.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.581
So, I mean,

12:27.681 --> 12:29.581
you're the only person.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.717
If it's not us,

12:29.615 --> 12:31.717
he's talking to you.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.153
- Yeah, well, you know,

12:31.750 --> 12:34.153
a lot of times he asked me

12:34.187 --> 12:36.489
to do things that I don't

12:34.187 --> 12:36.489
really have the time to do

12:36.523 --> 12:37.657
or want to do either.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.360
Like, I don't

12:37.691 --> 12:40.360
get body parts lasered.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.528
[laughter]

12:41.561 --> 12:43.363
- Oh, Lord, have mercy.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.963
- So if he gets another friend

12:44.998 --> 12:46.966
that occupies

12:44.998 --> 12:46.966
some of his time...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.402
- Everybody will get freed up.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.402
- There you go.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.500
But, of course, I've tried this

12:49.436 --> 12:52.500
before with a few other people,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.572
and they left there

12:52.105 --> 12:53.572
not thinking

12:53.605 --> 12:55.207
he even liked him at all

12:55.240 --> 12:57.409
because he wouldn't hardly

12:55.240 --> 12:57.409
talk to 'em.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.644
- Yeah.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.644
[chuckles]

12:58.677 --> 13:00.460
- So what was it like

12:58.677 --> 13:00.460
when he was a kid?

13:00.799 --> 13:02.548
Did he have friends then?

13:00.799 --> 13:02.548
Did he hang out with anybody?

13:02.581 --> 13:06.519
- We tried, Jay, but he just

13:02.581 --> 13:06.519
wanted to be an asshole.

<i>[lively music]</i>

13:16.863 --> 13:19.566

one-on-one time with Savannah.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.668
I mean, how can you beat that?

13:22.701 --> 13:23.970
- Elliott,

13:22.701 --> 13:23.970
you could not survive

13:24.700 --> 13:25.205
one-on-one time with Savannah.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.472
- I would eat you alive.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.807
- Oh, do you think

13:26.505 --> 13:27.807
I'd hate that?

13:31.177 --> 13:33.346
- Hello.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.346
- What are you even doing here?

13:33.379 --> 13:35.115
- He texted me

13:33.379 --> 13:35.115
and asked me where we were.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.750
- Because I wanted

13:35.148 --> 13:36.750
to talk to y'all.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.183
- Here we go again.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.755
what I came home to?

13:42.788 --> 13:44.957
- What?

13:42.788 --> 13:44.957
- Chloe tearing up the house,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.493
looking for a golden egg.

13:49.261 --> 13:52.231
- Listen, Chloe,

13:49.261 --> 13:52.231
you gotta go in there and win.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.100
- You gotta kick.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.100
You gotta punch.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.534
- Y'all were raised

13:54.100 --> 13:55.534
in the church.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.470
You know what Easter's about.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.240
And it's not about

13:57.504 --> 14:00.240
monetary things.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.429
- Easter is all about family,

14:00.273 --> 14:03.429
bonding, going to church,

14:03.429 --> 14:05.450
being there with one another.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.753
you've always taught us

not doing it with Chloe.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.725
She's eight years old.

to be, like, upset on Easter

14:27.267 --> 14:29.690
and disappointed

14:27.267 --> 14:29.690
the way that I was

14:29.690 --> 14:31.504
when Savannah always

14:29.690 --> 14:31.504
found the golden egg.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.740
It's true, Savannah,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.740
but I get it.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.643
Easter's not all about that,

14:34.740 --> 14:36.643
so we'll fix it.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.912
- In all fairness,

14:36.676 --> 14:38.912
remember at Granny's,

14:38.945 --> 14:41.246
you would always tell me

14:38.945 --> 14:41.246
where the golden egg was

14:41.280 --> 14:42.315
and that I could go after it.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.615
- That was after church,

14:42.349 --> 14:43.615
Savannah.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.351
- What?

14:43.649 --> 14:45.351
- I didn't make it all about...

14:45.384 --> 14:46.619
- So what you're saying is

14:46.653 --> 14:48.587
that you've been

14:46.653 --> 14:48.587
giving her inside information

14:48.620 --> 14:49.989
my entire childhood?

14:50.899 --> 14:51.825
I'm sitting here thinking

14:50.899 --> 14:51.825
that I'm just not good

14:51.857 --> 14:53.158
at finding things,

14:53.192 --> 14:55.327
and in reality,

14:53.192 --> 14:55.327
you're just a cheater.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.230
And you're a cheater.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.990
- It's not about you.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.990
This is about Chloe.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.301
- It's about Chloe.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.869
- You were in

15:01.333 --> 15:02.869
the middle of it too.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.738
[laughter]

15:07.440 --> 15:09.576
- Okay, Jay,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.576
what club do I use?

15:09.609 --> 15:10.909
- Let's get

15:09.609 --> 15:10.909
your eight iron out.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.446
- Does it have a number on it?

15:10.943 --> 15:13.446
- Yeah.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.548
- Okay. Eight. Okay.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.250
- You have played golf before?

15:15.581 --> 15:18.250
- Well, you know, but--

15:18.283 --> 15:21.254
- Let's make sure

15:18.283 --> 15:21.254
that they're not brand new.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.455
This is embarrassing.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.899
God, I hope nobody sees this.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.558
- What's the problem?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.558
You want to have new stuff.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.559
- Okay.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.596
Pete's gonna hit.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.197
- Why are we playing

15:29.629 --> 15:31.197
with these guys?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.966
- They're my buddies.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.966
You're going to love 'em.

15:33.659 --> 15:34.366
- I kind of like it

15:33.659 --> 15:34.366
just, you know,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.336
when I don't have

15:34.400 --> 15:36.336
a lot of people.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.971

15:36.369 --> 15:37.971
with a foursome

15:38.710 --> 15:39.706
when you're out

15:38.710 --> 15:39.706

- So Jay, my best friend,

15:39.739 --> 15:43.143
invited me for golfing today.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.846
And, you know, golfing's

15:43.176 --> 15:46.846
just kind of not my thing.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.313
- That's...

15:48.347 --> 15:49.982
Well, it's...

15:48.347 --> 15:49.982
the ball went forward.

15:50.830 --> 15:51.418
That's good.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.851
<i>it would be nice,</i>

15:52.885 --> 15:54.220
you know, that

15:52.885 --> 15:54.220
I could come and spend

15:54.254 --> 15:55.688

16:00.600 --> 16:03.289
you actually have to socialize.

16:03.289 --> 16:05.230
- I just think

16:03.289 --> 16:05.230
that's so overrated.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.340
I mean, I have a friend.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.340
I don't need any more.

- A friend. "A."

16:08.340 --> 16:09.402
- Yeah.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.504
more than one friend.

- Lies.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.707

16:25.250 --> 16:26.385
- Hey, Todd.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.721
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.721
- How are you?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.389
- Nice to meet you.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.389
- It's good to meet you too.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.956
- I think Pete,

16:29.422 --> 16:30.956
he used to live...

16:31.570 --> 16:32.459
- Oh, out in Los Angeles

16:31.570 --> 16:32.459
for a little bit.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.693
- Oh, LA? Oh, okay.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.693
- Yeah.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.462
- You lived in Buckhead

16:34.727 --> 16:36.462
for a long time.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.864
- Yes.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.864
- So in Peachtree City,

16:37.897 --> 16:39.698
you know, there's

16:37.897 --> 16:39.698
lots of golf courses.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.433
Did you say that

16:39.732 --> 16:41.433
you are a golfer, or--

16:41.467 --> 16:44.203
- No, I don't really

16:41.467 --> 16:44.203
understand golf that much.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.338
I mean, I'm really

16:44.236 --> 16:46.338
just here with Jay.

We're gonna have a great day.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.115
All right. Let's go putt.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.115
- All right.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.515
Let's go knock

16:55.148 --> 16:56.515
these things in, guys.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.951
Come on.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.418
- What's up with this?

16:59.451 --> 17:01.453
I mean, you know, you and I

16:59.451 --> 17:01.453
are the ones that hang out,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.623
I mean, not

17:01.488 --> 17:03.623
these two strangers.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.579
- Listen, they're great guys.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.599
And it's good for you

17:05.910 --> 17:07.599
to expand your horizons

17:07.930 --> 17:08.761
and your friendship circle.

17:07.930 --> 17:08.761
- No.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.309
I'm fine

17:08.795 --> 17:11.309
with expanding my horizons,

17:11.309 --> 17:13.329
but when it comes to friends,

17:11.309 --> 17:13.329
I've got enough friends.

17:13.329 --> 17:14.166
I've got you.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.336
I've got my family.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.380
- All right.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.380
Listen.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.638
I have a confession to make.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.409
Nanny and Chase took me

17:19.673 --> 17:22.409
to lunch the other day

17:22.442 --> 17:24.943
and they wanted me

17:22.442 --> 17:24.943
to help you...

17:25.450 --> 17:26.512
find some new friends.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.249
- I mean, that sounds pathetic.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.249
I'm not pathetic!

17:29.281 --> 17:31.417
- Well...

17:31.451 --> 17:32.751
Let's start right now.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.188
Let's go putt this ball

17:32.786 --> 17:35.188
and get it in the hole.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.957
- You know, I'm gonna do this,

17:35.221 --> 17:37.957
but don't start getting jealous

17:38.579 --> 17:39.893
because you don't like it

17:38.579 --> 17:39.893
when I have other friends.

17:39.925 --> 17:42.619
- I don't really think

17:39.925 --> 17:42.619
I'm gonna be that jealous.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.473
we'd have a little sandwich,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.142
or in Faye's case,

17:56.175 --> 17:57.777
looks like a big sandwich.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.491
y'all are having a lovely time.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.559
- Why?

18:12.525 --> 18:13.559
- What's wrong?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.609
- Why would you put Jay up

18:15.950 --> 18:16.762
to taking me

18:15.950 --> 18:16.762
on a blind friend date?

18:19.990 --> 18:21.934
- Look, we were just trying

18:19.990 --> 18:21.934
to help you out.

18:22.349 --> 18:23.536
- Don't help me out.

18:22.349 --> 18:23.536
I'm good.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.672
- We're trying to find you

18:23.569 --> 18:25.672
some friends, Todd,

18:25.704 --> 18:27.400
because you don't have any.

18:27.730 --> 18:28.740
- That's the problem.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.759
You're always bothering us.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.450
- Listen, we all agree

18:32.450 --> 18:34.114
that you do force us

18:32.450 --> 18:34.114
to go to things.

18:34.146 --> 18:37.150
- Who in this room has ever

18:34.146 --> 18:37.150
had to feel obligated

18:37.182 --> 18:38.550
to go and hang out with me?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.722
- You need to expand

18:41.688 --> 18:43.722
your social circle,

18:43.757 --> 18:46.625
'cause, I mean,

18:43.757 --> 18:46.625
you're relying on us a lot.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.162
- Your social circle

18:46.659 --> 18:49.162
is just your family.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.765
- Historically speaking,

18:51.798 --> 18:55.335
I mean, that is the way

18:51.798 --> 18:55.335
I've always lived my life.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.203
Listen, maybe I've been

18:55.367 --> 18:58.203
relying on my family too much.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.740
And maybe I do need

18:58.238 --> 19:01.740
to expand my social circle,

19:01.106 --> 19:03.209
but for me,

19:01.106 --> 19:03.209
my family is all I need,

19:03.242 --> 19:05.679
so why would I look outside?

19:05.711 --> 19:08.140
- And we love to spend time

19:05.711 --> 19:08.140
with you too.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.816
We just don't want

19:08.140 --> 19:09.816
to feel like, that,

19:09.848 --> 19:11.684
you know, we're being

19:09.848 --> 19:11.684
taken advantage of.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.919
- Well, I mean,

19:11.718 --> 19:12.919
I have no problem

19:13.190 --> 19:14.520
if you want

19:13.190 --> 19:14.520
to take advantage of me.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.221
- That's not

19:14.554 --> 19:16.221
what I'm talking about.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.691
- Clearly.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.226
I do see that

19:17.723 --> 19:20.226
you guys have a point.

19:20.259 --> 19:24.263
And I certainly do not want

19:20.259 --> 19:24.263
to intrude upon your lives.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.365
- Listen, I think

19:24.297 --> 19:26.365
it would be healthy.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.835
- Because we don't want to

19:26.398 --> 19:28.835
hang out with you all the time.

my Aunt Jane bought me a suit

for Easter.

Randy, my Aunt Mary

19:48.822 --> 19:51.910
bought his suits,

19:51.124 --> 19:53.792
and Jane bought me

19:51.124 --> 19:53.792
a pinstripe gray suit,

19:53.826 --> 19:55.862

20:20.753 --> 20:24.124

20:20.753 --> 20:24.124

spending time with
