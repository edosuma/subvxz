WEBVTT

00:10.012 --> 00:16.410
Well, it's uh... 2:07,
here on the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.

00:16.410 --> 00:20.240
As I said, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer,

00:20.240 --> 00:25.467
filling in for the temporarily detained Dr. Crane.

00:25.467 --> 00:35.658
It's cloudy and 62 degrees outside
coming up on 2:08... right... there.

00:35.658 --> 00:39.473
Well, let's take a call.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.329
Hello, Lydia.  What seems to be the problem?

00:42.329 --> 00:43.352
I already told you.

00:43.352 --> 00:47.634
Yeah, that was when I was the call screener,
now I'm the host.

00:47.634 --> 00:50.352
So, tell me your problem, and take your time.

00:50.352 --> 00:53.129
Well, it started about two weeks ago.

00:53.129 --> 00:55.275
I got this terrible obscene phone call.

00:55.275 --> 00:58.081
It's happened several times since then
and now it's to the point

00:58.081 --> 00:59.936
where I'm afraid to answer my own phone.

00:59.936 --> 01:02.064
Well, obscene phone calls can be very disturbing.

01:02.064 --> 01:03.866
But luckily, Dr. Frasier Crane has
just arrived and

01:03.866 --> 01:14.032
I'm sure he knows exactly
what soothing things to say.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.895
Maybe now would be a good time to take a break.

01:15.895 --> 01:18.066
We'll be right back after this.

01:18.066 --> 01:19.195
What the hell was that all about?!

01:19.195 --> 01:21.608
Oh, never mind that, where were you?

01:21.608 --> 01:23.983
Oh, god.  Somebody'd parked in my space again.

01:23.983 --> 01:27.488
I had to park six blocks from here
and sprint the whole way.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.163
By the end, my tweed pants were
throwing off so many sparks

01:30.163 --> 01:34.224
I almost caught myself on fire!

01:34.224 --> 01:36.895
I tell you what - the minute we go to a news break

01:36.895 --> 01:38.511
I'm going to rush down there and

01:38.511 --> 01:42.081
put this withering note on his windshield.

01:42.081 --> 01:45.881
Dear discourteous driver...?

01:45.881 --> 01:49.191
Whoa!  I think you've said enough right there!

01:49.191 --> 01:50.254
Come on, Frasier.

01:50.254 --> 01:52.008
This isn't gonna do any good!

01:52.008 --> 01:53.199
You want to make an impression on him?

01:53.199 --> 01:54.905
Get tough.  You go right down there

01:54.905 --> 01:56.751
and let the air out of his tires.

01:56.751 --> 01:58.279
Oh, I wouldn't do something like that.

01:58.279 --> 02:02.090
Why?  It's just inconveniencing him
like he inconvenienced you.

02:02.090 --> 02:04.025
Roz, listen, the world has become uncivilized enough

02:04.025 --> 02:05.898
without me stooping to that level.

02:05.898 --> 02:08.771
Of course I was sorely tempted last night.

02:08.771 --> 02:11.836
I went to the movies to see
"How Green Was My Valley."

02:11.836 --> 02:14.676
Lady Luck seated me in front of two
elderly women who said with the arrival of each

02:14.676 --> 02:21.122
new actor, "My God, doesn't he look young; 
he's dead, you know."

02:21.122 --> 02:22.656
Finally I had to just walk out.

02:22.656 --> 02:29.372
Oh, you're on in five seconds.
And Brenda is on line one.

02:29.372 --> 02:31.538
Hello, Seattle.  We're back, and
I would like to start by

02:31.538 --> 02:34.212
apologizing for being tardy.

02:34.212 --> 02:38.161
Nothing quite so inconsiderate as
making someone wait.

02:38.161 --> 02:40.979
Now without further ado let's get to Brenda.

02:40.979 --> 02:42.524
Hello, Brenda.

02:42.524 --> 02:46.522
Hi, Dr. Crane. I'm having a problem with my sister.

02:46.522 --> 02:48.920
She's always... Oh, wait a second.

02:48.920 --> 02:55.163
That's my other line.

02:55.163 --> 03:00.000
Something tells me I'm going to be siding 
with Brenda's sister.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.123 --> 03:23.716
You're welcome!

03:23.716 --> 03:27.145
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could direct me to...

03:27.145 --> 03:29.618
Friendly Video.

03:29.618 --> 03:31.841
Yeah, I think we got that one.

03:31.841 --> 03:34.000
Hang on a second, I'll check.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.586
Don't you hate that?

03:35.586 --> 03:37.648
You come all the way down here yourself to the store,

03:37.648 --> 03:42.018
wait patiently, and somebody who calls
in from home gets preferential treatment.

03:42.018 --> 03:47.649
I can help the next person in line.

03:47.649 --> 03:49.371
Hey, do we have "The Invisible Man?"

03:49.371 --> 03:53.810
Right here!

03:53.810 --> 03:56.064
Thanks.Yeah, we got it.

03:56.064 --> 04:00.609
Excuse me. I was looking for...

04:00.609 --> 04:05.458
Don't even think about it!

04:05.458 --> 04:07.775
I'm looking for "How Green Was My Valley."

04:07.775 --> 04:09.913
Huh?

04:09.913 --> 04:14.672
It is a beautifully acted depiction
of life in a small town in Wales.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.249
It won five Academy Awards!  It's a classic!

04:17.249 --> 04:19.750
Oh. Well, uh, this is a shot in the dark,

04:19.750 --> 04:26.566
but you might try looking in the Classics section.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.646
Uh... you're taking "How Green Was My Valley?"

04:28.646 --> 04:29.552
I heard it was great.

04:29.552 --> 04:30.719
Yes, but you heard it from me!

04:30.719 --> 04:36.250
You were standing next to me in the line!

04:36.250 --> 04:38.358
Excuse me, is there another copy?

04:38.358 --> 04:43.740
Oh yeah, that would be across the street
in our "How Green Was My Valley" annex.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.024
Hey Daphne. Come on, you're just in time.

04:56.024 --> 04:57.759
It's starting.

04:57.759 --> 04:59.480
I don't get this show.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.749
People send in videos of themselves having

05:01.749 --> 05:04.320
the most embarrassing and painful accidents.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.953
They add cartoon noises and music and
everyone laughs themselves silly.

05:08.953 --> 05:17.626
Boy, I bet that hurt!

05:17.626 --> 05:19.178
Well, what's wrong with you?

05:19.178 --> 05:23.773
Frankly, I have had it with the
whole boorish, ill-mannered world.

05:23.773 --> 05:26.652
Look, Dad, would you mind terribly
if I used the TV tonight?

05:26.652 --> 05:28.825
I went to three video stores to get this tape.

05:28.825 --> 05:30.768
I'm just dying to see it.

05:30.768 --> 05:33.592
Sure, go ahead.  How many times can you watch

05:33.592 --> 05:38.536
a dog get hit with a swinging door?

05:38.536 --> 05:50.171
Depends upon the dog.

05:50.171 --> 05:52.772
What the hell is that?!

05:52.772 --> 05:58.763
The windows are rattling, the walls
are shaking, and I am talking to no one!!

05:58.763 --> 06:00.691
Well, I see our neighbor's at it again.

06:00.691 --> 06:02.433
Not for long!

06:02.433 --> 06:03.711
I'm gonna take a nap.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.755
Frasier: Dad, you can't possibly
expect to sleep in this racket.

06:05.755 --> 06:08.031
Are you kidding?  
I've slept through worse than this.

06:08.031 --> 06:11.536
In Korea I dropped off in a foxhole
right outside P'Anmunjom.

06:11.536 --> 06:13.499
By the time I woke up the cease-fire was over and

06:13.499 --> 06:15.721
I was the only one who didn't know about it.

06:15.721 --> 06:18.258
Talk about having egg on your face.

06:18.258 --> 06:20.175
Yes.  Yes, would you please connect
me with the young man

06:20.175 --> 06:22.472
who's just moved into the penthouse upstairs.

06:22.472 --> 06:23.570
No, I don't know his name!

06:23.570 --> 06:25.378
He's in the penthouse!

06:25.378 --> 06:28.234
He has shaggy hair, tattoos all over him,

06:28.234 --> 06:29.250
his body is pierced.

06:29.250 --> 06:39.426
Oh, and I don't know if I mentioned
this but he's in the penthouse!

06:39.426 --> 06:42.088
Never mind.

06:42.088 --> 06:45.423
Has the world completely lost the
concept of common courtesy?

06:45.423 --> 06:48.538
Am I the only one who is resisting this tide?!

06:48.538 --> 06:53.314
People of Seattle, listen to me!

06:53.314 --> 06:55.626
We are not barbarians!

06:55.626 --> 06:59.273
We are not Neanderthals and we are not French!

06:59.273 --> 07:06.384
Do you hear that, you up there?! [

07:06.384 --> 07:08.752
That's his own music he's listening to, you know.

07:08.752 --> 07:10.880
His name is Freddie Chainsaw.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.807
Chainsaw?  Of the Newport Chainsaws?

07:15.807 --> 07:19.927
How does an arrested adolescent
who barely knows two chords get a penthouse?

07:19.927 --> 07:22.822
His last album sold five million copies.

07:22.822 --> 07:33.078
Oh.  Well, then, I'll just add
that to my list of reasons to die.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.696
You know, personally, I like it.

07:34.696 --> 07:38.041
But then, we Brits have always
been on the cutting edge.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.584
You should have heard the punk
rockers who rented the flat below me

07:40.584 --> 07:41.710
a few years back.

07:41.710 --> 07:45.016
They'd play the same song over and over again

07:45.016 --> 07:51.350
Flesh is burning... nana nana nana.
Flesh is burning... nana nana nana.

07:51.350 --> 07:56.110
Oh no.  
I'm gonna have that tune in me head all day now.

07:56.110 --> 07:57.044
Yes, well, thank you for that, Daphne.

07:57.044 --> 08:12.353
But I've been waiting all day to watch my movie.

08:12.353 --> 08:21.126
Doesn't he ever stop for sex and drugs?!

08:21.126 --> 08:23.143
Hello.  Yes.  Please,

08:23.143 --> 08:27.423
I insist on being connected with
the young man in the penthouse.

08:27.423 --> 08:31.093
Yes, hello, Mr. Chainsaw?  Yes, how do you do?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.942
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  I am your neighbor;

08:32.942 --> 08:34.799
I live right below you.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.847
Yes, do you have any idea how loud your music is?

08:38.847 --> 08:54.239
Oh.  You do?  Well... thank you.

08:54.239 --> 08:55.366
I'm going out!

08:55.366 --> 08:55.938
What?

08:55.938 --> 08:56.959
I'm going out!

08:56.959 --> 08:57.701
What?

08:57.701 --> 08:59.526
I AM GOING OUT!

08:59.526 --> 09:01.143
Hey, Frasier, will you keep it down out there.

09:01.143 --> 09:03.351
I'm trying to take a nap!

09:11.837 --> 09:15.470
Smell me, Niles.

09:15.470 --> 09:16.562
Grandpa!

09:16.562 --> 09:19.534
Exactly!  On my way down in the elevator today

09:19.534 --> 09:22.079
a woman thinks nothing of lighting up a cigarette.

09:22.079 --> 09:23.390
Has the world gone mad?

09:23.390 --> 09:25.134
I know exactly how you feel.

09:25.134 --> 09:28.174
This morning I discovered a ding
in the door of my car.

09:28.174 --> 09:30.433
Let me guess - no note on the windshield?

09:30.433 --> 09:33.989
No.  And even worse, after I'd left
the car off at the body shop,

09:33.989 --> 09:36.653
the rental agency didn't have 
a single luxury car left.

09:36.653 --> 09:41.121
They stuck me with some vehicle
I believe they call a Hunchback.

09:41.121 --> 09:44.333
No.  I think that would be a Hatchback, Niles.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.000
It's painted panic-button red, with
a large rear window that pops open.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.232
Oh, that would be the Hatchback.

09:50.232 --> 10:00.471
Well, there's a novel idea: name
the car after its most hideous feature.

10:00.471 --> 10:02.399
I presume it was a toss-up between "Hatchback" and

10:02.399 --> 10:06.783
"What's that odor coming from the floor?"

10:06.783 --> 10:10.349
Oh, look, Niles - free table!  Go, go, go, go!

10:10.349 --> 10:11.165
Oh, the biscotti!

10:11.165 --> 10:11.845
Leave it!

10:11.845 --> 10:17.144
Oh, no - go on without me!

10:17.144 --> 10:17.910
Oh, there!

10:17.910 --> 10:23.444
Oh!

10:23.444 --> 10:24.835
Oh, check on table one!

10:24.835 --> 10:36.185
All right, fine.

10:36.185 --> 10:38.179
Oh, we're not hovering, believe me.

10:38.179 --> 10:42.584
It's just that there... well,
there's really no place else to stand.

10:42.584 --> 10:43.930
Oh, just take your time, please.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.387
There's no rush.

10:46.387 --> 10:48.489
Is the owner of a red Hatchback here?

10:48.489 --> 10:50.273
It's about to be towed.

10:50.273 --> 10:51.257
Niles, isn't that your car?

10:51.257 --> 10:54.970
Shh!  Someone will hear you!

10:54.970 --> 10:56.729
Niles, it's about to be towed!

10:56.729 --> 10:57.835
I'm not owning up to that car.

10:57.835 --> 11:01.761
I don't care if it's careening
toward a baby carriage!

11:01.761 --> 11:03.063
Oh.  Oh, thank you so much.

11:03.063 --> 11:08.137
Take care, have a lovely day.

11:08.137 --> 11:11.119
Excuse me, but we were waiting for this table.

11:11.119 --> 11:14.069
So get another one.

11:14.069 --> 11:15.515
Well, there aren't any.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.195
Look, you knew that we were waiting for it.

11:17.195 --> 11:18.755
We politely stood back and let
those people leave and then

11:18.755 --> 11:20.429
you just jumped right in here!

11:20.429 --> 11:24.715
Well, you won't make that mistake again.

11:24.715 --> 11:25.741
Frasier, Frasier... forget it.

11:25.741 --> 11:27.043
We'll just... we'll wait for another table.

11:27.043 --> 11:30.477
No, we won't!  This isn't about the table anymore!

11:30.477 --> 11:33.556
This is about the erosion of common decency.

11:33.556 --> 11:37.074
Sir, when you treat me this way you
encourage me to be discourteous to another.

11:37.074 --> 11:41.002
And so on and so on.

11:41.002 --> 11:45.292
You don't have any manners, do you?

11:45.292 --> 11:56.539
Then perhaps what you need is an etiquette lesson!!

11:56.539 --> 12:00.792
SIT DOWN, NILES!

12:00.792 --> 12:02.635
My brother will have a decaf.

12:10.044 --> 12:15.968
Flesh is burning, nana nana nana...

12:15.968 --> 12:23.516
Nana nana nana... flesh is burning... 
nana nana nana...

12:23.516 --> 12:25.388
Oh, hi, Fras.  How you feeling?

12:25.388 --> 12:27.043
Fine.

12:27.043 --> 12:30.633
I didn't ask you yesterday how your day went.

12:30.633 --> 12:32.123
What did Niles tell you?

12:32.123 --> 12:34.521
Nothing!  
Geez, can't I ask you how your day went?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.315
How was work?

12:36.315 --> 12:40.729
How's your bad-ass self?

12:40.729 --> 12:42.682
Dammit!  Niles blabbed!

12:42.682 --> 12:44.316
No, he didn't.

12:44.316 --> 12:45.833
You made the people of Seattle column.

12:45.833 --> 12:50.664
Right here, under "The Crane Mutiny."

12:50.664 --> 12:53.811
"Three cheers for Dr. Frasier Crane,
who struck a blow against

12:53.811 --> 12:57.145
rudeness yesterday in a coffeehouse melee."

12:57.145 --> 12:59.017
Perfect!

12:59.017 --> 13:01.339
Now all of Seattle knows about my loutish behavior!

13:01.339 --> 13:02.313
What are you talking about?

13:02.313 --> 13:03.729
This guy had it coming.

13:03.729 --> 13:05.482
I can just picture it.

13:05.482 --> 13:06.798
He probably looked at you and he thought,

13:06.798 --> 13:12.313
"This guy's a creampuff, you know.
A wuss... a wimp... a cupcake..."

13:12.313 --> 13:13.415
Dad!

13:13.415 --> 13:18.505
I'm sorry, I'm just so proud of you!

13:18.505 --> 13:20.777
Ah, there he is, the man who floats like a

13:20.777 --> 13:27.592
lepidoptera and stings like a hymenoptera.

13:27.592 --> 13:29.295
Niles, I think you're just jealous.

13:29.295 --> 13:31.440
Jealous?  Don't be ridiculous!

13:31.440 --> 13:32.830
This is my favorite part.

13:32.830 --> 13:35.721
"With one swift move the good doctor 
hoisted the miscreant

13:35.721 --> 13:37.369
out on his ear, declaring,

13:37.369 --> 13:40.345
'What you need is an etiquette lesson.'"

13:40.345 --> 13:43.995
I love that!  
You got your own tough-guy catchphrase!

13:43.995 --> 13:44.912
It's perfect for you, Frasier.

13:44.912 --> 13:49.882
Dirty Harry meets Emily Post.

13:49.882 --> 13:51.788
Come on.  Show me how you grabbed him.  
Use Niles.

13:51.788 --> 13:55.657
No, no Dad.  
I will not toss Niles about the room.

13:55.657 --> 14:02.368
Oh no, go ahead.  Rough me up,
Mr. Big Hero Bully Bouncer!

14:02.368 --> 14:03.697
Did that sound jealous?

14:03.697 --> 14:04.554
A tad.

14:04.554 --> 14:05.496
Well, all right, I'm jealous.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.539
Why shouldn't I be?  All my life
I've backed out of fights

14:08.539 --> 14:10.569
and watching you leap into the fray like that,

14:10.569 --> 14:14.834
I... it made me think just once 
I'd like to experience what you felt -

14:14.834 --> 14:16.263
go nose to nose.

14:16.263 --> 14:17.639
Oh, your day will come, son.

14:17.639 --> 14:27.844
I don't know.  I tried it this morning
with my dry cleaner, Mr. Kim.

14:27.844 --> 14:30.719
I decided to give him a good
tongue-lashing because he'd shattered

14:30.719 --> 14:33.855
the mother-of-pearl buttons on my best waistcoat.

14:33.855 --> 14:36.466
Unfortunately, due to his tenuous grasp 
of English and

14:36.466 --> 14:38.204
the fact that his mother's name is Pearl

14:38.204 --> 14:44.817
I was forced to flee his establishment
amid a shower of coat hangers.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.601
Good morning, Dr. Crane.

14:46.601 --> 14:50.289
And to you, Dr. Crane, our very own
knight in shining armor...

14:50.289 --> 14:51.506
Oh, great.

14:51.506 --> 14:54.283
I want you to know that 
your assertiveness inspired me.

14:54.283 --> 14:57.572
For weeks now, some louse has been
removing my wet clothes from

14:57.572 --> 15:00.864
the washer and leaving them 
on the table in a soggy mess.

15:00.864 --> 15:03.496
This morning, I decided to get my revenge.

15:03.496 --> 15:08.330
So I took off my new red panties and
I popped them in with his whites.

15:08.330 --> 15:10.434
Bravo, Daphne.  Good for you.

15:10.434 --> 15:14.754
God, I wish I'd been there.

15:14.754 --> 15:17.072
Daphne, don't you think you were 
overreacting just a bit?

15:17.072 --> 15:18.305
Absolutely not.

15:18.305 --> 15:22.609
Those were my panties 
and I wasn't afraid to use them.

15:22.609 --> 15:24.776
Fras, why do you keep backing away from this?

15:24.776 --> 15:26.538
I mean, you should be proud of yourself.

15:26.538 --> 15:28.008
We all think you did the right thing.

15:28.008 --> 15:29.239
The newspaper does too.

15:29.239 --> 15:29.978
That's right.

15:29.978 --> 15:32.702
And I'm going to fix you 
a proper hero's breakfast.

15:32.702 --> 15:33.583
No.  No, no... Daphne.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.521
Please, really.

15:34.521 --> 15:35.578
It's not necessary.

15:35.578 --> 15:36.343
Thank you all.

15:36.343 --> 15:39.979
It's just that this isn't sitting well with me.

15:39.979 --> 15:45.833
I find it hard to believe 
any good can come of violence.

15:45.833 --> 15:52.998
That's it again!

15:52.998 --> 16:07.073
Mr. Chainsaw.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane...

16:07.073 --> 16:11.652
Go ahead, Daphne.  Make my eggs.

16:24.636 --> 16:26.796
You know, 
I do wish people would stop making such a fuss.

16:26.796 --> 16:32.434
They will, 
if you quit walking up and down the hall.

16:32.434 --> 16:33.741
You're on in five seconds.

16:33.741 --> 16:40.585
Oh yes, all right.

16:40.585 --> 16:43.117
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

16:43.117 --> 16:44.514
Who's on the line, Roz?

16:44.514 --> 16:46.172
We have Mitch on line three.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.260
He's having trouble with his neighbors.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.243
Hello, Mitch.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.885
Make that had trouble.

16:51.885 --> 16:56.132
This idiot next door had his leaf-blower
going at 7:00am, again.

16:56.132 --> 16:57.363
Oh, that's very inconsiderate.

16:57.363 --> 17:01.337
I'll say.  That's why I decided to
give him an "etiquette lesson."

17:01.337 --> 17:07.571
I grabbed that leaf-blower 
and smashed it against atree.

17:07.571 --> 17:10.346
Mitch, I must say I'm stunned.

17:10.346 --> 17:15.473
I can't imagine amore extreme response
to such a minor infraction.

17:15.473 --> 17:18.989
...so I snuck into his backyard and shoved
a whole pound of rotten shrimp

17:18.989 --> 17:23.000
into his air conditioner!  Come on summer!

17:23.000 --> 17:29.352
...hey, he asked for it.  So I put
100 scorpions in a FedEx package.

17:29.352 --> 17:33.153
Look, I'm sorry, 
but no matter how provoked you may have been,

17:33.153 --> 17:37.958
there is no earthly justification for...
SETTING SOMEONE'S LAWN ON FIRE!!

17:37.958 --> 17:39.772
But she doesn't curb her dogs!

17:39.772 --> 17:42.648
Oh...

17:42.648 --> 17:45.813
You don't take any guff.  Why should I?

17:45.813 --> 17:48.686
Rochelle... all of you... look,

17:48.686 --> 17:52.399
don't you realize that your behavior
is just a bit extreme?!

17:52.399 --> 17:56.368
I displayed a minor bit of force in
order to just make a point.

17:56.368 --> 18:00.222
I didn't go around smashing windows
or torching lawns!

18:00.222 --> 18:01.581
Where does it end?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.605
Are you saying that what I did was wrong?

18:03.605 --> 18:04.735
Of course I am!

18:04.735 --> 18:06.249
But what you did was okay?

18:06.249 --> 18:14.197
No, no!  I... come to think of it,
what I did was just as wrong.

18:14.197 --> 18:17.592
I mean, who am I to draw the line
at the acceptable level of force?

18:17.592 --> 18:20.430
Because the next person moves a little
farther, and the next person,

18:20.430 --> 18:23.558
a little farther still until we finally
end up with scorpions flying

18:23.558 --> 18:28.099
through the mail like Christmas bundt cakes!

18:28.099 --> 18:31.926
What we must all agree to do is to resolve
our differences with

18:31.926 --> 18:34.879
discussion and reason.

18:34.879 --> 18:37.879
As a matter of fact, I'm going to call
the gentleman that

18:37.879 --> 18:41.590
I manhandled and... and apologize to him
for not having worked

18:41.590 --> 18:46.870
out our dispute in the right way in the
first place-through words.

18:46.870 --> 18:50.128
The key here is restraint.

18:50.128 --> 18:56.159
And I do hopeyou'll follow my lead...
Becky with the nail gun.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.580
Oh... people.  People, please.

19:07.580 --> 19:12.853
There's no need for that.  I'm no hero.

19:12.853 --> 19:14.795
No one's ever given me the thumbs up.

19:14.795 --> 19:16.722
Well, Niles, 
I've driven on the freeway with you.

19:16.722 --> 19:21.003
The rest of the hand has been well-represented.

19:21.003 --> 19:25.004
Oh, look, there he is.  Mr. Harvey,
I'm so glad you could come.

19:25.004 --> 19:30.033
You remember my brother, Niles, and
uh... we're at "our" table.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.924
Look, I'm here, so say what's on your mind.

19:31.924 --> 19:34.025
Well, there's no need for any hostility.

19:34.025 --> 19:35.484
I just came to talk.

19:35.484 --> 19:38.881
Talk?  You're not gonna take another shot at me?

19:38.881 --> 19:42.761
No! No, they'll be nothing like that here today!

19:42.761 --> 19:45.268
Now, listen, I could try to explain
my behavior by saying that

19:45.268 --> 19:47.321
these are stressful times we live in, that

19:47.321 --> 19:48.602
I had reached the end of my tether.

19:48.602 --> 19:51.331
But I won't do that, because you see, 
I was 100% wrong.

19:51.331 --> 19:55.928
I had absolutely no right to touch
you and I accept full responsibility.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.092
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.

19:58.092 --> 19:59.785
And I hope you all heard that too.

19:59.785 --> 20:01.565
So, then you accept my apology?

20:01.565 --> 20:02.954
No, I'm suing you.

20:02.954 --> 20:05.795
And I've got a lot of witnesses that
just heard you admit you were wrong.

20:05.795 --> 20:08.531
But, but... 
these are stressful times we live in and

20:08.531 --> 20:10.492
I'd reached the end of my tether!

20:10.492 --> 20:13.953
Tough!  I'm nailing you for assault!

20:13.953 --> 20:15.585
But I hardly touched you!

20:15.585 --> 20:18.314
Oh, Frasier, I'm not surprised
he's hiding behind lawyers.

20:18.314 --> 20:24.280
What other behavior would you expect... 
from a chicken?

20:24.280 --> 20:25.735
What did you say?

20:25.735 --> 20:27.025
I was speaking to my brother.

20:27.025 --> 20:30.863
But, to put it in language you can understand...

20:30.863 --> 20:31.752
bawk bawk bawk bawk!

20:31.752 --> 20:36.369
Niles!  
This is no time for you to assert yourself!

20:36.369 --> 20:38.537
Hey, your brother's making trouble here...

20:38.537 --> 20:39.992
Oh, oh, oh... what are you gonna do?

20:39.992 --> 20:43.481
Flap me with one of your big fluffy wings?

20:43.481 --> 20:45.410
Niles, stop it!  Please excuse him!

20:45.410 --> 20:47.135
Oh, for god's sake, Frasier don't
waste your breath on this

20:47.135 --> 20:50.353
hairy, knuckle-dragging, 
mouth-breathing troglodyte

20:50.353 --> 20:57.817
who's probably the only male in
existence who suffers from penis envy!

20:57.817 --> 21:04.528
You look here, buddy...

21:04.528 --> 21:12.719
Niles!!  Niles... are you all right?!

21:12.719 --> 21:15.383
Counter suit!

21:15.383 --> 21:18.711
Oh, my god!!  Nobody move him!

21:18.711 --> 21:19.951
I barely touched him!

21:19.951 --> 21:21.585
Then you admit you touched him!

21:21.585 --> 21:23.856
He admits it!

21:23.856 --> 21:26.194
Oh, Niles.  Niles, I'm here for you.

21:26.194 --> 21:32.327
I promise we're going to get you
the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY!

21:32.327 --> 21:33.667
My god, Niles, that was brilliant.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.019
You even got a tear in your eye!

21:35.019 --> 21:38.315
I landed on a fork.
