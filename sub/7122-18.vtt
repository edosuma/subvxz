00:24.300 --> 00:26.140
The King Worm

00:31.610 --> 00:32.310
My king...

00:33.180 --> 00:33.850
My king?

00:35.290 --> 00:36.580
Wake up, husband!

00:38.520 --> 00:39.040
What?

00:41.150 --> 00:43.090
Long live the king!

00:43.090 --> 00:45.090
What is goin' on?

00:47.670 --> 00:48.610
Not much.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.870
Long live the king!

00:51.070 --> 00:52.070
Huh?

00:54.170 --> 00:55.570
WOWOWOWOWOWOW!

00:56.160 --> 00:58.100
Hey! Do I know you?

01:01.830 --> 01:02.180
Hey...

01:02.680 --> 01:03.720
I know that guy...

01:04.840 --> 01:06.630
He doesn't know he's dreaming.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.130
Come on, honey.
Eat your soup.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.060
Wait, wait, wait...

01:18.630 --> 01:19.580
Eat it, now!

01:25.470 --> 01:26.110
What kind of...?

01:27.430 --> 01:29.270
How did we get here?

01:33.020 --> 01:34.040
I'm good on the soup.

01:36.650 --> 01:37.400
You...!

01:37.970 --> 01:39.730
You haven't much time, sir.

01:40.080 --> 01:40.680
What?

01:40.850 --> 01:42.200
You are trapped in a dream,

01:42.290 --> 01:44.060
and you are in danger!

01:47.910 --> 01:49.950
You need to find this worm

01:50.070 --> 01:50.840
and break it.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.190
Find the worm?

01:52.580 --> 01:52.830
But...

01:53.160 --> 01:54.200
You've got him right there.

02:05.190 --> 02:05.660
Jake?

02:13.760 --> 02:16.590
Hold down the tape until it fully sticks
to the paper.

02:16.890 --> 02:17.560
Like this?

02:17.910 --> 02:20.170
Yes, but now try holding it higher.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.190
Like this?

02:21.690 --> 02:22.630
You need more tape.

02:24.920 --> 02:25.710
Use this.

02:28.470 --> 02:29.870
Now, tape the bottom.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.370
Who is it for?

02:33.720 --> 02:34.490
Who is it for?

02:35.680 --> 02:37.350
It's for... um...

02:38.910 --> 02:39.880
It's for me!

02:40.380 --> 02:41.030
Play this.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.840
Um... okay.

02:50.570 --> 02:51.340
The worm!

02:51.540 --> 02:51.940
The worm!

03:01.530 --> 03:02.470
Worm...

03:02.650 --> 03:04.740
Worm! WOIM!

03:04.980 --> 03:05.930
Worm!

03:06.250 --> 03:06.670
Finn?

03:06.970 --> 03:08.670
Aw, man - is it really you?

03:09.680 --> 03:10.180
Jake?

03:10.900 --> 03:11.940
Yea, I think so.

03:14.780 --> 03:15.130
Yep!

03:15.520 --> 03:16.820
I'm trapped in this dream.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.080
I can't wake up!

03:18.460 --> 03:19.050
Me, too.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.810
I was just in some other part of the dream 
with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess.

03:23.130 --> 03:24.170
Make-out dreams?

03:24.620 --> 03:25.460
Nice!

03:25.940 --> 03:26.560
What?!

03:28.820 --> 03:30.310
No, it wasn't like that!

03:30.810 --> 03:31.980
Hey, I won't judge.

03:35.410 --> 03:36.800
Lady's got two mouths.

03:37.740 --> 03:38.800
Mm-hm. I don't think she's real.

03:40.350 --> 03:40.800
Weird!

03:46.440 --> 03:47.290
Ouch! What was that for?!

03:47.610 --> 03:49.290
Just wanted to make sure you 
were real.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.410
Our dreams must be linked for some reason.

03:53.950 --> 03:54.470
Well...

03:55.240 --> 03:58.640
PepBut told me we gotta find the worm
that crawled through that hole and break it.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.100
In <i>my</i> dream...

04:02.470 --> 04:08.610
suddenly an unimaginably amazing sword
appeared in front of me - 
able to blast the hole open.

04:10.280 --> 04:10.870
Rad!

04:12.890 --> 04:14.380
I usually dream of messed-up stuff.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.269
Like a shark tryin' to bite off my face.

04:21.810 --> 04:22.680
Careful!

04:22.900 --> 04:25.760
If you grunk up the dreamscape
with your subconscious fears,

04:25.930 --> 04:27.350
the whole thing will blow apart.

04:29.490 --> 04:30.910
Just shrink down, like me.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.860
And then, I shrunk down like Jake.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.440
How come you know so much 
about dreams and stuff?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.080
'Cause I sleep a lot.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.550
Oh, yea!

04:51.730 --> 04:52.880
Fionna, Cake!

04:53.100 --> 04:54.090
I need your help!

04:54.470 --> 04:54.820
What?!

04:55.190 --> 04:56.110
What did you say?

04:56.410 --> 04:57.870
I really did it this time!

04:58.070 --> 05:00.780
They're loose! And they're coming for us!

05:00.980 --> 05:01.350
Who?

05:16.140 --> 05:16.790
Dad?!

05:19.520 --> 05:20.440
Help us!

05:22.900 --> 05:25.110
Maybe he's not... really real.

05:25.960 --> 05:26.430
Dad?

05:26.750 --> 05:27.700
Are you okay?

05:41.760 --> 05:44.820
That scarf looks... <i>familiar</i>.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.240
Yeeeaaa...

05:56.330 --> 05:58.190
Man! The worm is fast!

05:58.470 --> 05:59.590
Yea! It's nuts!

06:00.010 --> 06:01.150
Fast as nuts.

06:01.450 --> 06:02.790
Well, let's catch it with...

06:03.160 --> 06:05.000
Some big ol' legs!

06:05.400 --> 06:07.810
Well, that's kind of boring for me

06:08.130 --> 06:10.020
'Cause that's my normal power,
you know.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.220
Then you get...

06:11.490 --> 06:12.380
Birds!

06:22.130 --> 06:23.940
Remember, this is just a dream.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.060
Keep climbin'.

06:32.120 --> 06:32.740
Now what?

06:32.940 --> 06:33.510
Break it!

06:52.800 --> 06:53.320
Jake!

06:53.570 --> 06:54.210
Are you okay?

06:54.590 --> 06:55.850
Yea, are you?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.090
Yea... I'm okay.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.430
We did it!

06:59.660 --> 07:01.250
Yea, yea, yea!

07:01.370 --> 07:03.090
Yea, yea, yea!

07:08.280 --> 07:10.390
Was that mirror always like that?

07:14.370 --> 07:15.890
I'm pretty sure this is <i>not</i> normal.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.140
Nah, it's fine.

07:26.400 --> 07:26.750
Jake,

07:27.070 --> 07:28.190
I think we're still dreaming.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.650
Nah, it's just dream residue.

07:30.870 --> 07:31.670
Forget about it.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.720
You sure know a lot about dream stuff.

07:38.230 --> 07:39.370
You pinched me earlier...

07:39.850 --> 07:41.370
But I never pinched <i>you</i>.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.730
Everything's normal.

07:48.740 --> 07:50.830
Errythung's normuhhl.

07:53.960 --> 07:54.910
It's still a dream!

08:02.910 --> 08:04.180
Hey, guys...

08:11.590 --> 08:13.420
Why are you jankin' up my dreamscape?

08:13.500 --> 08:14.220
Listen...

08:14.520 --> 08:16.220
Don't worry about it...

08:16.360 --> 08:16.980
What?!

08:17.280 --> 08:18.790
You can't defeat me.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.280
I'm the King Worm.

08:20.680 --> 08:27.870
I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape
until I've consumed all your life energy.

08:28.110 --> 08:29.280
My life energy?!

08:29.630 --> 08:30.620
I use that!

08:34.049 --> 08:34.480
Wait...

08:35.150 --> 08:35.940
Something's wrong...

08:36.409 --> 08:37.110
I'm missing something.

08:38.730 --> 08:39.770
The worm!

08:41.830 --> 08:42.450
Oh, man...

08:42.950 --> 08:44.020
I'm gonna be stuck here.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.540
Forever!

08:48.740 --> 08:49.460
Hey, guys...

08:49.890 --> 08:50.710
Knock it off.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.670
If you grunk up the dreamscape with
your subconscious fears

08:56.940 --> 08:58.360
the whole thing will blow apart.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.250
Oh, yea.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.460
Thanks, Dream Jake!

09:08.150 --> 09:09.570
Get ready to eat it!

09:16.330 --> 09:17.050
Okay, Finn.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.150
Concentrate.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.900
Deepest gut fears...

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Oh, gross.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.170
The ocean...

09:47.450 --> 09:49.510
Okay. Okay, that wasn't so bad.

09:51.180 --> 09:51.800
Oh Glob!

09:51.900 --> 09:52.820
The Lich!

09:54.510 --> 09:57.860
Hey, why don't you sit down,
or pass out or something?

09:57.990 --> 09:58.760
Never!

10:04.400 --> 10:05.040
Bubblegum!

10:07.280 --> 10:07.750
Finn, shush!

10:09.740 --> 10:11.560
I'm having coffee with the Lich.

10:11.810 --> 10:12.870
You wouldn't understand.

10:13.450 --> 10:16.130
You're too <i>young</i>!

10:23.710 --> 10:25.550
So much screaming!

10:36.240 --> 10:37.310
Had enough...

10:38.080 --> 10:39.020
destabilization?

10:39.440 --> 10:42.950
I don't... know what you're talking about.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.680
I'm a clown!

10:48.190 --> 10:49.810
Well, that's that.

10:54.630 --> 10:56.020
I don't feel so good.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.130
Get out of my house, King Worm!

11:01.960 --> 11:03.400
Is it really you... this time?

11:03.680 --> 11:04.370
Yea, mans.

11:04.370 --> 11:05.120
Actual Jake.

11:05.390 --> 11:05.910
Cool. Pinch.

11:07.580 --> 11:08.610
Ow, man. Come on!

11:08.610 --> 11:09.360
I'm just checkin'!

11:10.700 --> 11:11.360
Just checkin'.
