09:23.805 --> 09:26.731
The new nickname. (laughs)

09:28.051 --> 09:30.384
Don't you hate when
you go to the store

09:30.462 --> 09:32.553
and forget the one thing
that you went to go get?

09:32.631 --> 09:34.130
Mama!

09:34.149 --> 09:38.818
Trust me, it's gonna
happen to you too... D.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.394
Hmm.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.989
Will these do?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.492
Awesome! Thank you.

09:46.661 --> 09:48.628
(chuckles)

09:56.655 --> 09:58.096
Uh...

10:01.602 --> 10:03.435
Where'd you get this?

10:03.511 --> 10:06.162
I've been saving up
my allowance.

10:06.181 --> 10:07.939
I want to join Little League.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.590
What happened to soccer?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.526
Baseball's cooler.

10:12.762 --> 10:14.696
This is gonna be awesome.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.661
New game, new rules, I guess.

10:24.683 --> 10:27.016
This all looks lovely.

10:27.035 --> 10:28.701
You know what?
We need more wine.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.370
I'm gonna get some more wine.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.522
Hey. Why don't you give me a
hand over here, little brother?

10:32.540 --> 10:35.258
MADDIE:
(sighs) Just got the baby down.

10:38.713 --> 10:41.514
(whispers):
Out here.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.368
You keep your wine outside?

10:45.428 --> 10:48.104
What the hell were you thinking?

10:49.132 --> 10:50.631
Uh, I don't know.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.467
We were having dinner
and he asked about you.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.635
Asked what?

10:54.655 --> 10:57.046
Asked about Maddie, and Jee-Yun.

10:57.065 --> 10:59.157
And I don't know,
I just blurted it out.

10:59.234 --> 11:00.158
"You should come to America.

11:00.309 --> 11:01.551
Visit your granddaughter."

11:01.720 --> 11:03.569
And it never occurred
to you after dinner

11:03.722 --> 11:05.664
the next day or during
the 17-hour flight

11:05.891 --> 11:07.073
that you could call me?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.000
Shoot me a text or an email,
send a carrier pigeon?

11:09.152 --> 11:11.152
I didn't tell you because
I knew what you'd say.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.338
-Yeah. "No."
-Exactly.

11:13.565 --> 11:16.257
Better to beg for forgiveness
than ask for permission.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.512
God, I taught you too well.

11:21.756 --> 11:22.906
Look at that.

11:22.924 --> 11:25.183
Almost looks like a family,
doesn't it?

11:25.334 --> 11:28.502
Is it so bad to be all together?

11:28.596 --> 11:31.264
Look, there's no good
that can come

11:31.416 --> 11:34.109
from Pop being back
in my life. Okay, Albert?

11:35.696 --> 11:38.363
Then keep him out.
We're just visiting anyway.

11:38.514 --> 11:39.698
Hey, hey, hey.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.182
(sighs)

11:41.201 --> 11:43.201
I'm glad you came.

11:44.112 --> 11:46.830
Well... as long as you're happy.

11:48.099 --> 11:50.767
What's that they say,
about becoming a parent?

11:50.860 --> 11:53.712
It stops being about you?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.789
You may not want a father,

11:56.866 --> 11:59.968
but Jee-Yun deserves
a grandfather.

12:04.466 --> 12:06.725

12:09.637 --> 12:12.230
<i> CARRIE:</i>
<i> We don't call you an addict</i>

12:12.381 --> 12:14.548
<i> and we don't subscribe</i>
<i> to the idea</i>

12:14.626 --> 12:15.625
that you have a disease.

12:15.643 --> 12:18.127
Drug use is a continuum
of behaviors.

12:18.146 --> 12:20.480
And we recognize that living
with it requires

12:20.632 --> 12:23.224
a non-judgmental
and non-coercive approach.

12:23.318 --> 12:26.560
Safer use, managed use.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.787
Abstinence.

12:27.897 --> 12:29.322
These are the tools
in the toolbox.

12:29.474 --> 12:30.490
Cool.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.917
-So I can manage it from home.
-ATHENA: No.

12:32.994 --> 12:34.544
You cannot.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.238
Your mother's right, Jada.

12:37.332 --> 12:38.405
And that's why you're here.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.741
TREY:
That's why we're all here.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.002
To meet you wherever
you're at, be it halfway

12:43.096 --> 12:45.004
or only part of the way.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.156
So, can you get her clean?

12:47.250 --> 12:49.083
Again, Mrs. Grier,

12:49.102 --> 12:50.918
"clean" somehow denotes
that she's dirty

12:51.012 --> 12:54.514
and we don't deal with
those kinds of absolutes.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.608
(exhales)

12:57.426 --> 12:58.610
Why don't we show you the place

12:58.761 --> 13:00.987
and what we can do?

13:02.265 --> 13:04.357
Can I get a tour of my own?

13:04.509 --> 13:06.284
You know what?

13:06.435 --> 13:08.286
Tamara can show you around.

13:08.513 --> 13:10.288
She was just like you
a few months ago

13:10.457 --> 13:14.167
and now she helps
others find a new path.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.670
(Jada sighs)

13:19.190 --> 13:20.614
I was here a couple of times

13:20.634 --> 13:24.043
before I finally found a way
to get myself on solid ground.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.096
How long did that take you?

13:29.643 --> 13:33.478
Well, this garden
is a great place to chill.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.795
Cool.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.566
So I get to come out here
and pop off, right?

13:39.894 --> 13:42.395
He said you guys
would meet me halfway.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.471
If all you're thinking
about is using,

13:44.566 --> 13:46.640
then you're not living.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.142
So the more I use,
the more my mom's got to pay?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.903
I don't think you're getting
the point of this place.

13:51.056 --> 13:52.405
We're trying to get you
to live with it,

13:52.499 --> 13:53.573
not fight against it.

13:53.725 --> 13:55.908
The only thing I'm fighting
is my mom.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.651
CARRIE:
She can absolutely start today.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.004
The facility has 12 beds
and there's one open.

14:00.156 --> 14:03.249
And no one will know
that Jada's here, Mrs. Grier.

14:03.401 --> 14:05.844
We're very private.
Very exclusive.

14:05.995 --> 14:08.346
Oh. "Exclusive."

14:08.497 --> 14:10.515
I have a friend
who runs a hedge fund.

14:10.742 --> 14:13.092
He likes to say,
"That's French for expensive."

14:13.186 --> 14:14.744
CARRIE:
Well, if you know
the finance world,

14:14.913 --> 14:17.838
then you know the value
of a good investment.

14:17.932 --> 14:20.007
An investment in
your daughter's future.

14:20.101 --> 14:22.935
Well, I like investments
that get results.

14:23.029 --> 14:27.590
So... how much is this
going to cost me?

14:27.759 --> 14:29.775
Here you go.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.369
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> $100,000?</i>

14:31.596 --> 14:33.872
-Are they kidding?
-Definitely not kidding.

14:33.948 --> 14:36.040
Also, definitely
not taking insurance.

14:36.192 --> 14:38.784
All that money and they
still get three times

14:38.912 --> 14:40.786
as many complaints
as any other facility,

14:40.939 --> 14:42.438
more than any of those
places in Malibu,

14:42.457 --> 14:45.366
and they already have five
deaths in the last year.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.943
But they haven't been
investigated?

14:46.961 --> 14:49.295
Mm. They get away
with it every time.

14:49.447 --> 14:51.723
When someone ODs
in a place like this,

14:51.874 --> 14:53.224
it's almost considered routine.

14:53.376 --> 14:56.636
And she actually said they'd
let you use on the premises?

14:56.788 --> 14:58.712
Uh, not in so many words.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.456
"Hard reduction," she called it.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.642
"Harm reduction."

15:02.736 --> 15:04.460
Then what happened to Wendall?

15:04.479 --> 15:05.478
ATHENA:
There's just no way to know.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.798
I mean, very private,
very exclusive.

15:08.816 --> 15:12.076
Also very happy to hide behind
patient confidentiality.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.727
I'm sorry, Bobby.

15:13.805 --> 15:16.322
-I've got to get to
class in an hour.
-All right.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.731
I'll see you guys later.
Good luck.

15:17.825 --> 15:20.126
-Bye.
-Thank you, May.

(sighs)

15:26.501 --> 15:28.042
(door closes)

15:28.836 --> 15:31.429
Maybe this has run its course.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.247
Run its course?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.324
Wendall's family
has already filed

15:35.326 --> 15:36.676
a complaint with the state.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.327
Why don't we let them
take it from here?

15:38.346 --> 15:40.104
-I can't do that.
-Bobby...

15:40.256 --> 15:41.773
It has been four months.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.666
If you keep hanging on
to this...

15:43.685 --> 15:45.184
I have to hang on to something.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.445
I know what it's like
to feel lost like that.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.855
And these people...
they prey on it.

15:50.008 --> 15:53.117
Yeah, they profess that they're
gonna lend a helping hand,

15:53.269 --> 15:55.602
and then they do the opposite.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.121
What these people do,

15:57.348 --> 15:59.106
keep the patient addicted

15:59.275 --> 16:01.033
and then they take as much
of their money as they can.

16:01.186 --> 16:03.294
Well, clearly they have
a different approach.

16:03.446 --> 16:05.612
I'm the first to admit a 12-step

16:05.632 --> 16:06.965
is not for everybody.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.357
Addiction is a hard road

16:08.376 --> 16:10.284
and people have to find
their own way,

16:10.378 --> 16:12.303
but that is not what
happened here.

16:12.530 --> 16:15.364
We still don't know what
happened here.

16:15.383 --> 16:19.060

I'm running out of ideas

18:03.583 --> 18:06.809

running out of patience.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.516
ATHENA:
Not that I can see.

18:30.668 --> 18:34.003
But he doesn't always
let me see.

18:34.021 --> 18:35.780

18:36.765 --> 18:43.770
Your stepfather has never been
good with a no-win situation.

18:43.865 --> 18:47.183
And this one is shaping up
to be a real terrible one.

18:47.276 --> 18:48.851
Even Wendall's family

18:48.944 --> 18:52.371
is accepting the story
that he OD'd.

18:52.523 --> 18:56.634
Well, maybe we shouldn't,
just yet.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.028
Tamara, the girl I met at
Winding Paths Recovery?

18:59.046 --> 19:00.045
ATHENA:
Mm-hmm.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.806
She said something that...

19:01.957 --> 19:03.032
got me thinking.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.625
She was a patient there

19:04.719 --> 19:07.562
before she started
working the place.

19:08.723 --> 19:10.389
So I made a fake account

19:10.483 --> 19:13.726
as Jada Grier and started
following her on Insta.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.228
She documented
her healing journey.

19:16.381 --> 19:18.214
Hmm. Let me guess.

19:18.307 --> 19:20.641
It was all rainbows
and sunshine?

19:20.735 --> 19:21.826
And praying hand emojis.

19:21.977 --> 19:24.495
But when I was looking back
at the dates,

19:24.572 --> 19:27.406
I noticed that there
was a gap there.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.241
When she was actually
in recovery,

19:29.335 --> 19:31.318
probably without her phone.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.153
But that gap covers the day

19:33.247 --> 19:36.081
Bobby found Wendall
in that fire.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.493
You guys said that you thought
he died at the facility

19:39.512 --> 19:42.329
and that they moved him

another place then.
-Why?

29:41.188 --> 29:43.989

have died at yours?

29:45.100 --> 29:47.692
Are you some kind of cop
or something?

29:47.787 --> 29:48.952
What do you want from me?

29:49.029 --> 29:52.456
One of those people
who died was a friend.

29:52.683 --> 29:54.166
His name was Wendall.

29:56.111 --> 29:59.187
He... he OD'd.

29:59.281 --> 30:01.632
In a field. He was smoking...

Wendall didn't smoke.

30:04.119 --> 30:05.043
You know that.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.971
You were in the same program
as him.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.455
What else do you know?

30:09.475 --> 30:14.294
Tamara, someone I love,
someone who's in recovery

30:14.313 --> 30:16.129
got addicted to pain pills
and booze

30:16.223 --> 30:17.648
because of a back injury.

30:17.799 --> 30:20.466
He likes to say it wasn't
because of his back.

30:20.561 --> 30:23.654
It was what he was
carrying around.

30:26.066 --> 30:29.201
He couldn't get right
until he let it go.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.538
Don't you want to let it go?

it's time to fly home.

Yeah, that I've been gone
less than a year

31:14.206 --> 31:15.873

31:16.100 --> 31:17.982

31:34.618 --> 31:36.468
-What?
-PHILLIP: That's fantastic!

31:36.620 --> 31:38.303
I had a feeling when
you bought this house.

31:38.455 --> 31:41.565
I mean, it's a little soon
to be pregnant again, but...

31:41.734 --> 31:42.807
Why not?!

31:42.976 --> 31:44.884
-(laughter)
-This is very good news, Howard.

31:44.978 --> 31:46.795
-Why didn't you tell us sooner?
-Uh, guys...

31:46.888 --> 31:49.406
Guys, we're... not pregnant.

31:49.633 --> 31:51.658
-You're not?
-No.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.803
Then who is?

31:54.896 --> 31:58.064
Uh, it belongs to
a friend of mine.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.641
An old roommate.

31:59.734 --> 32:00.900
And it's a boy.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.645
Well, how nice.
He sent you a sonogram.

32:03.647 --> 32:05.738
Well, actually,
I helped him get pregnant.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.926
Him and his wife, they
were having trouble conceiving

32:09.094 --> 32:11.762
and they asked me
to be their sperm donor.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.674
And you said yes?

32:15.826 --> 32:16.934
So you're the father?

32:17.161 --> 32:18.251
I'm the donor.

32:18.328 --> 32:21.521
Connor is the father.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.515
I think it's...

32:23.667 --> 32:25.275
Here we go.

32:25.427 --> 32:27.277
...great.

32:27.429 --> 32:28.779
Uh, yeah?

32:29.006 --> 32:31.949
You're a miracle baby
yourself, Buck.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.509
Why not share it?

32:34.602 --> 32:36.361

32:41.368 --> 32:44.035
It's not really for me to allow.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.279
A man cannot raise a child

32:46.298 --> 32:48.465
fathered by another man,
it's unnatural.

32:48.616 --> 32:50.950
Says the expert
in child-rearing, huh?

32:51.119 --> 32:53.286
I would think you would
relate to Buck's decision.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.697
Father them and let
someone else raise them.

A man who cannot control
his family is not a man.

33:00.295 --> 33:03.722

controlling forces his sons

33:03.816 --> 33:05.874
