go any higher?

00:38.671 --> 00:41.141
{\an8}- This is the biggest New York
city heatwave in decades.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.476
{\an8}Temperatures are expected
to climb to 110 degrees--

00:43.543 --> 00:45.712
{\an8}though we have bigger
things to worry about.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.747
{\an8}Gentlemen, we have
one question

00:47.814 --> 00:49.816
{\an8}and only one question
to answer.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.919
{\an8}- If mannequins could move,
what sport would they play?

00:52.986 --> 00:55.355
{\an8}- Ugh. No.
What is the gyre?

00:55.422 --> 00:58.124
{\an8}We have to find it.
It's our only hope.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.527
{\an8}We don't know if it's a weapon,
or a place, or a--

01:00.593 --> 01:03.396
- I think bowling would
be right up their alley.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.397
- Oh, I can't take
this heat.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.934
How do you guys stand
this city in the summer?

01:08.001 --> 01:09.502
{\an8}- We haven't got
any other choice.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.637
- Well, I do.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.972
My mom invited me
to a house in the country.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.175
She's got a pool.
She's on a lake.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.810
{\an8}- Seems a little
redundant.

01:16.876 --> 01:17.811
{\an8}- Well, it beats
being here,

01:17.877 --> 01:18.978
{\an8}stewing in
our own juices.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.280

01:25.385 --> 01:27.420
- How am I supposed to find
the gyre without power?

01:27.487 --> 01:28.822
I need power!

01:28.888 --> 01:30.890
- The people who really have
power don't need to demand it,

01:30.957 --> 01:32.158
they just have it.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.593
- I said I didn't
have it.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.994
- And I ignored that.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.396
- SARALINE:
Dad!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.065
What happened
to the power?

01:39.132 --> 01:41.067
- Apparently, it's only
out in the Wayne.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.535
The transformer in
the basement shut down,

01:42.602 --> 01:45.138
so, it could be
out for hours, days even.

01:45.205 --> 01:47.373
- Oh, that does it.
I'm calling my mom.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.675
- Not yet.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.009
Dad, how did
you cool off

01:50.076 --> 01:51.544
back in the days
before electricity?

01:51.611 --> 01:53.913
- Olly, it was
New York City in the 1970s.

01:53.980 --> 01:57.050
We had electricity--
sometimes.

01:57.116 --> 02:00.553
For cooling off,
my friends and I were obsessed

02:00.620 --> 02:03.056
with finding the Wayne's
swimming pool.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.524
- The Wayne has
a swimming pool?

02:04.591 --> 02:06.493
- Some say it's
just a legend,

02:06.559 --> 02:10.163
but we had a theory
it was on the 13th floor.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.232
Oh, all we ever found
was the password

02:12.298 --> 02:15.001
you were supposed
to give the lifeguard--

02:15.068 --> 02:17.003
"gimble in the wabe."

02:17.070 --> 02:18.137
- What in the who now?

02:18.204 --> 02:19.772
- Gimble in the wabe.

02:19.839 --> 02:21.107
That's from something.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.876
- Anyway, your mom
and I'll be in the kitchen

02:22.942 --> 02:24.744
in our underwear,
if you need us.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.247

Where are you going?

02:27.313 --> 02:28.381
- ANSI:
To find the pool.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.916
- OLLY: And definitely
not pee in it.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.284
- Olly, there's no point.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.586
You heard what dad said.
The pool is probably a myth.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.555
- You're just saying that
because you don't like swimming.

02:35.622 --> 02:36.723
- No.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.291
- She was a guppy,
I was...

02:38.358 --> 02:40.393
something like lox.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.395
- We need to focus
on what's important--

02:42.462 --> 02:43.363
the gyre.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.497
Besides,
you don't even know

02:44.564 --> 02:46.299
where to start looking
for the pool.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.434
- Sure, we do--
the 13th floor.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.905
- That's the thing--
there is no 13th floor.

02:51.971 --> 02:54.941
- Pushing this button is pushing
my button-pushing button.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.276
Why elevator not come?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.411
- The power's out.
Let's take the stairs.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.446
- Come on, Thomas Edison.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.782
- And now you're blaming
me for the Civil War?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.218
- SARALINE: I still
think it's a wild goose chase.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.353
Lots of buildings
don't have 13th floors.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.122
It's triskaidekaphobia.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.124
- Fear of snack crackers.
- Fear of the number 13.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.759
- But isn't the 14th floor

03:12.825 --> 03:14.761
just the 13th floor
with a different name?

03:14.827 --> 03:18.097
- Yes, unless there's
a secret 13th floor,

03:18.164 --> 03:19.666
and that's worth
looking into.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.569
- All I want is something
big and blue and wet.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.504
{\an8}- Then you want a whale--
which, by the way,

03:24.571 --> 03:26.406
{\an8}you won't find in
the country with your mom.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.749
- Uh, yeah.
I slipped in a puddle.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.253
- The puddle formerly known
as Wendell Wasserman.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.355
- Wendell?
What are you doing here?

03:42.422 --> 03:44.057
- Sweating to death!

03:44.123 --> 03:46.225
In relative peace,
might I add--

03:46.292 --> 03:49.095

on my effluvia.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.431
Yes, boys sweat, too.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.899
- Why don't you take
off your robe?

03:52.966 --> 03:54.267
- I can't.
My body's too good.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.302
I don't wanna make
Ansi jealous--

03:56.369 --> 03:59.238
even though I'm hot enough
to fry an egg between my--

03:59.305 --> 04:01.174
actually,
does anyone smell eggs?

04:01.240 --> 04:03.076
Is that just me?
[sniffing]

04:03.142 --> 04:04.978
- Olly, use the smell pal.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.680

admiring my gadget.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.337
What is it, you ask?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.106
- I didn't ask.
- Zero interest.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.074
- Behold,

04:35.141 --> 04:37.110
It makes your beamstars
look like toys.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.444

05:11.844 --> 05:14.147
You know that stuff that turns

05:14.213 --> 05:16.382
Well, this one time--
[muffled chatter]

05:17.950 --> 05:21.054

We'll check out

05:25.258 --> 05:26.592

These horizontal lines

you say we hose off?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.601
- Olly, that's not
a garden hose.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.438
It's strictly for putting out
fires and washing elephants.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.505
- Washing elephants?

05:39.572 --> 05:42.341
But my thighs

We found the pool.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.847
{\an8}I guess it
wasn't a myth.

{\an8}- LEIF: Do I detect an echo...
[echoing]

08:03.516 --> 08:06.352

08:06.419 --> 08:08.387
- Tastefully appointed.

The Feng shui
doesn't stink.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.661
{\an8}I could live without the
lifeguard chair tail, however.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.930
- Last one in's
a rotten egg cream.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.867
- No running,
and no horseplay!

08:20.933 --> 08:23.402
If I can't enjoy this,
no one will.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.738
- What?
- Come on.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.940
- We came all this way
for an empty pool?

08:28.007 --> 08:31.043
- It's as dry as
the drier of two dryers.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.311
- Start spitting.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.014
If we work together,
we could fill it by Thursday.

- BOYS:
[horking]

08:36.649 --> 08:39.518
- Stop! You guys, I hear
something. You hear it?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.554
The power's working
on this floor.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.089
- Oh, what's it
running off of?

08:43.155 --> 08:44.657
- And look at the walls.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.493
There are gyre
symbols everywhere.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.662
There's more to this
room that just a pool.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.264
- You're talking
Jacuzzi, right?

08:51.330 --> 08:52.531

keep your eyes peeled.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.834
- This is a job
for the Leifstar.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.136

08:57.203 --> 08:58.471

it found me yet?

09:02.675 --> 09:06.178

the pool's closing!

09:57.930 --> 10:00.266

I'll keep him occupied.

{\an8}We have to distract it.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.057
{\an8}Hey, cyclops, you get
half-off at the optometrist?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.792
{\an8}- Wanna go see
a 3D movie?

10:26.859 --> 10:28.828
{\an8}Oh, wait, you can't.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.830
{\an8}- Yeah, 'cause
you've got one eye,

10:30.896 --> 10:33.499

also near-sighted.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.484
- I don't know.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.019
It's pretty hard to see.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.054
Look, a generator.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.856
It probably won't

11:21.447 --> 11:23.282

do you take me for?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.653
