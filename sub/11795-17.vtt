01:14.307 --> 01:17.777
 Kelly, do you realize
 we've been going
 steady for 68 days,

01:17.811 --> 01:19.646
14 hours and 37 minutes?

01:19.679 --> 01:22.716
   38 minutes, Zack,
   but then again,
   who's counting?

01:24.984 --> 01:26.786
  Do you like
  this shake, Slater?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.655
I like it when
you shake, Mama.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.294
And I can't wait
for the next earthquake.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.965
Slater,
you're making me blush.

01:38.998 --> 01:41.634
 If I really wanted to make you
 blush, I'd call you...

01:43.870 --> 01:45.672
Don't you dare.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.109
  Honey lips.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.243
  Who are you
  guys trying to kid?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.012
  You've been going
  out since the prom.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.248
  Everybody knows it.
  Why don't you
  make it official?

01:55.281 --> 01:58.785
  Well, Slater and I
  feel that being stuck
  in a monogamous relationship

01:58.818 --> 02:00.854
 is restrictive and possessive.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.056
  Yeah, what she said.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.357
Me too.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.327
  Well, I like a touch
  of a familiar hand,

02:07.360 --> 02:10.797
 the secure feeling of being
 with someone I know and trust,

02:10.830 --> 02:13.667
 and those
 beautiful hazel eyes.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.236
 Yup! It's a dirty rotten job,
 but someone's got to do it.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.838
Let me tell you,
these beautiful

02:18.872 --> 02:20.073
   hazel eyes are
   late for geometry.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.374
  Let's go.
  Bye, guys.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.876
  See ya.
  See you guys later.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.248
  Did you really agree
  with what I said
  about relationships?

02:28.281 --> 02:31.217
Yeah, in fact, why waste
anymore time with you

02:31.251 --> 02:33.953
  when I could be off
  meeting Miss Right?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.890
That's Ms. Right, bubba,
and I'm right here.

02:43.129 --> 02:45.832
   Lisa: Wait a minute.
   Is the gossip really true?

02:45.865 --> 02:48.668
  You and Slater are,
  dare I say the word,
  a couple?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.404
Well, yeah, kinda sorta.

02:51.438 --> 02:55.008
 Did you hear the news?
 Jessie and Slater
 are a couple.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.911
   A couple of what?

02:57.944 --> 03:01.147
   Screech, they're in love.
   Stop and smell the roses.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.883
   I smelled the roses once
   and a bee flew up my nose.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.253
  Why don't you guys celebrate
  this Saturday night?

03:08.154 --> 03:09.723
 Hey, are you available, Mama?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.124
Anytime for you.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.696
   Let's decide
   where we want to go.
( bell ringing )

03:16.730 --> 03:18.598
 Okay, let's go.
   Bye, guys.

03:22.836 --> 03:23.903
   Hi, Kelly.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.772
  Hi.

03:25.805 --> 03:28.241
  Saturday's our
  10-week anniversary.
  Let's do something special.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.344
 I'd love to,
 but Todd Winfield's visiting.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.979
  Your
  ex-boyfriend Todd Winfield?

03:33.079 --> 03:34.948
  I promised I'd go
  to dinner with him.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.349
  You want to go out with him?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
  No, it's not a date,
  he's my friend.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.354
   Right, a friend who drives
   a Ferrari and
   look like Mel Gibson.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.790
   Zack, you're being jealous
   about nothing.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.226
Jealous? Who's jealous?
Go ahead, marry him.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.395
   Have lots of kids.
   See if I care.

03:52.932 --> 03:56.236
 What?
 Todd Winfield's
 going out with Kelly?

03:56.269 --> 03:57.704
What about Zack?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.005
  I think Todd
  likes Kelly better.

04:01.841 --> 04:04.210
 Hey, guys, what's up?
 Is Jessie here yet?

04:04.244 --> 04:08.048
 No, but thank
 goodness you're here,
 this dink is frying my brain.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.317
   What else is new?

04:11.351 --> 04:13.153
   That's what
   I want to know,

04:13.186 --> 04:15.221
 where are you taking
 Jessie Saturday night?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.089
You are taking her out,
aren't you?

04:17.123 --> 04:20.726
 Yes, I'm taking her out, Lisa.
 And no,
 I'm not telling you where.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.062
   You mind if I
   tell Jessie first?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.296
   Yes, I do.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.865
 I'm the school gossip,
 and the public
 has a right to know.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.072
  I've got our entire evening
  planned for Saturday.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.674
You do? So do I.
All right, you go first.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.978
   We begin with
   a romantic dinner
   at Cafe Diane

04:39.079 --> 04:40.980
   and then on to the ballet.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.850
Ballet?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.087
   Come on, Jessie, get real.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.221
   You know how
   hard it was for me

04:48.254 --> 04:50.223
to get these LA
Raider tickets?

04:50.256 --> 04:53.727
  Football?
  There's nothing romantic
  about a bunch of barbarians

04:53.760 --> 04:55.195
  kicking each other's butts.

04:56.863 --> 05:00.033
   Oh, yeah? What's romantic
   about a guy in pink tights

05:00.066 --> 05:03.336
tippy-toeing around
pretending to be a swan?

05:03.370 --> 05:06.573
   I should have known better
   than to go steady
   with a sexist pig!

05:10.143 --> 05:12.045
   Oink, oink, baby.
   And if you don't like it,

05:12.078 --> 05:13.947
  go steady
  with some other pig.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.851
 Maybe I will!
 Goodbye!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.089
  Can you believe her?

05:25.358 --> 05:27.594
Does anybody know
what just happened here?

05:27.627 --> 05:30.930
   I'm not sure,
   but I'll bet it ruins
   their date Saturday night.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.602
   Hi, guys.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.071
  Kelly, can we talk?

05:43.710 --> 05:45.679
Kelly...

05:45.712 --> 05:47.180
  I've given this
  a lot of thought...

05:50.083 --> 05:52.752
 and I don't want you
 going out with Todd Winfield.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.087
 Zack, he's my friend.
 You can't

05:54.120 --> 05:55.622
tell me who to
be friends with.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.624
  Either you cancel
  the date or else...

06:01.027 --> 06:03.129
  Or else what, Zack?

06:03.163 --> 06:04.831
   Or else we stop
   seeing each other.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.734
  You don't mean that.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.102
   Yes, I do.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.840
  Well...if that's
  how you feel, okay.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.241
 Good, I'm glad that's settled.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.843
  Good, here's your ring back!
  Goodbye!

06:20.280 --> 06:24.150
 Ooh, first Jessie, now Kelly.
 My phone's gonna
 be busy tonight.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.823
   Any new business?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.558
   Yes, as council president,

06:31.591 --> 06:34.561
 I move we rescind last week's
 resolution to
 buy new uniforms.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.262
 I second that motion.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.264
Wait! You can't rescind
a resolution like that.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.699
We need those uniforms.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.334
Too late,
and we don't need them.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.436
  This school needs
  a dance department.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.372
 Great idea,
 I second that motion.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.806
   All in favor?
   Girls: Aye.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.708
Wait a minute,
wait a minute...

06:48.742 --> 06:51.444
That's a terrible idea.
All opposed?

06:51.478 --> 06:52.979
  Nay!
Guys: Nay!

06:53.079 --> 06:55.582
  Oh, no, no, no, no,
  you've got the wrong animal.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.451
Horses say nay,
pigs say oink.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.320
  Let me tell you something...
  Let me...no.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.554
  ( arguing )

07:01.588 --> 07:03.656
  Order! I want order!

07:03.690 --> 07:05.625
 Order!

07:06.693 --> 07:09.295
Look, I broke my gavel.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.797
What's all this
fighting about?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.499
  ( arguing )

07:12.532 --> 07:15.935
  Whoa! Whoa!

07:16.036 --> 07:19.039
 One at a time.
 Zack, you first,
 and I want the truth.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.340
  Huh!

07:21.841 --> 07:23.443
The truth is,
Kelly's cheating on me.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.844
   I am not.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.579
   What do you call
   dinner with Todd Winfield?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.315
 A meal with
 another human being.
 I do it all the time.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.518
She admits it.
   Hold it.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.387
 What does any of this
 have to do with
 Jessie and Slater?

07:34.421 --> 07:36.856
Okay, I'll tell you Mr.
Belding,
Slater is a pig.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.263
 Mr.
 B, in her warped little mind,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.232
everything I do
is chauvinistic
just because I'm a guy.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.469
  Oh, no, no, no, no,
  just because you
  are you, meathead.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.905
Who you calling
a meathead, skinny lips?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.609
 Meathead? Skinny lips?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.712
  When you young
  men and women mature

07:58.745 --> 08:00.780
  you will learn
  that "relationships"

08:00.814 --> 08:03.216
   are an exercise
   in understanding,

08:03.249 --> 08:04.651
 trust, and compromise.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.252
  ( intercom buzzes )

08:09.556 --> 08:10.657
  Yes?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.625
  Put her on.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.195
 It's my wife.
 Listen to how we communicate.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.369
   Yes, dear.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.504
 I know, dear.

08:24.537 --> 08:28.041
  But, dear, I thought
  that we compromised

08:28.041 --> 08:30.510
  and agreed that your mother
  would stay at the hotel

08:30.543 --> 08:32.212
 and I'd pay anything.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.350
Too bad if she
doesn't like it,
we agreed.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.587
  No, she doesn't get a vote!

08:41.587 --> 08:43.857
 Becky, don't do this.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.892
It's my house too,
you can't lock me out...

08:48.061 --> 08:49.429
 Becky?

08:51.731 --> 08:54.534
   Well, that's just perfect.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.971
  Where was I?

08:58.071 --> 09:01.608
 Understanding, trust,
 and compromise in
 "relationships."

09:02.676 --> 09:04.544
 Right.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.914
 Jessie, it's time you stopped
 bullying poor,
 defenseless Slater

09:08.014 --> 09:10.583
and tried understanding
his needs.

09:10.617 --> 09:15.288
  And Kelly,
  stop leading young Zack on.
  Think of his feelings.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.190
 Slater's needs?
Zack's feelings?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.259
   What about us?
   Don't our feelings
   and needs matter?

09:19.292 --> 09:20.627
Obviously not, let's go.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.028
 ( both scoff )

09:24.564 --> 09:27.534
Screech,
when I first met Becky,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.403
  she was a sophomore,
  I was a senior.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.938
   I didn't know
   you were Spanish.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.410
   No, Screech,
   a senior classman.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.513
 The Max was
 an Italian place then.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.450
 We shared a plate of rigatoni
 and fell in love.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.653
  That's nice.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.855
 But I prefer linguini.
 See you later.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.257
  Oh, what's the use?

09:51.291 --> 09:53.626
  15 years of marriage
  just down the drain.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.865
Cheer up, Mr. B.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.669
It's like I say,
when elephants fight
only the grass suffers.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.940
  Well, <i>adios,</i> senior.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.541
   Whoa, Screech, that's it.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.477
   What's it?

10:10.510 --> 10:13.880
 What you said about elephants
 reminded me of
 my mother-in-law.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.285
 I refuse to allow her
 to live in my house.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.521
  I'll go tell her, sir. Bye.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.324
   Oh, Screech,
   you careless little chap.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.460
 You know what?
 I wish I had some place to go.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.696
  Not as much as I do.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.534
 So...who do you think
 will call first?

10:34.901 --> 10:35.969
Kelly or Jessie?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.470
They won't call.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.938
 They'll write or send flowers.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.876
  ( knocking on door )

10:42.909 --> 10:44.577
Hey, like I always say,

10:44.611 --> 10:46.813
   the best way to say
   "I love you" is in person.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.682
  I love you.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.484
 I love you too, Zack,
 but only as a friend.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.420
 Hey.
 Mr. Belding?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.321
 What is he doing here?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.723
 He followed me, Zack.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.958
 I tried to lose him.
 He's pretty
 quick for an old guy.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.930
Men, it's important
that we stick together
during times like these.

11:03.963 --> 11:07.867
 As long as we have each other,
 we can cope. Let's bond.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.770
 We were sort of hoping
 to bond with
 Kelly and Jessie, sir.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.439
  We kind of miss 'em.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.307
   Miss 'em? Phooey.

11:14.341 --> 11:18.311
 Men don't need women,
 women need men,
 it's in their genes.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.780
   We really miss the way
   they look in those jeans.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.651
   Be strong, Slater.
   Resist temptation.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.587
Zack, nice room.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.623
   Brings back fond memories
   of my youth.

11:30.657 --> 11:35.462
 Hey! We can tough out
 this crisis in
 here if necessary.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.998
  Wait, do you mean we
  as in us and you?

11:44.771 --> 11:47.507
 I can't stand seeing
 my friends so unhappy.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.276
  You guys, why not
  forgive and forget?

11:50.310 --> 11:54.514
 I'd rather be short
 and fat with bad hair.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.618
   I do miss Zack,
   but I don't understand why
   he gets so jealous.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.687
  Because he's a guy.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.823
   See that girl over there?

12:03.857 --> 12:06.459
   Gorgeous,
   great personality.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.430
  Kelly, how would you feel if
  she and Zack
  were "just friends"

12:10.463 --> 12:11.865
having dinner together?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.401
 I'd kill him.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.971
 And you, "Honey lips,"
 why don't you
 give Slater a break?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.939
  He happens to be
  a very sensitive guy

12:19.973 --> 12:22.409
 when he isn't
 knocking people down.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.712
 Maybe you're right,
 I have been
 narrow-minded and prejudiced.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.448
  And don't forget bullheaded.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.417
   But I'm gonna
   swallow your pride for you

12:30.450 --> 12:32.585
  and tell the guys
  you want to make up.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.087
Isn't that surrendering?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.922
  They're the ones
  who should
  swallow their pride.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.624
  You should
  swallow your tongue.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.726
   Your big mouth has gotten
   you into enough trouble.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.898
 Thanks for buying the pizzas,
 Mr. Belding.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.001
  Hey, guys take care of guys,
  and what are we?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.636
   All: Guys!

12:49.669 --> 12:51.738
Oh, Slater,
this must be your pizza.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.307
   It has "I hate Jessie"
   spelled out in anchovies.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.112
This is fun.
Let's do our man cheer.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.313
   All right.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.448
   One, two, three...

13:01.481 --> 13:02.716
 ( all belch )

13:03.550 --> 13:05.385
  <i>( knocking on door )</i>

13:05.418 --> 13:06.753
   Zack, I've got...

13:07.821 --> 13:10.623
Mr. Belding,
what are you doing here?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.225
 Bonding with my boys.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.627
 Oh, okay.
 You guys, I've got great news.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.695
  Jessie and
  Kelly wanna make up.

13:15.729 --> 13:16.763
 What?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.298
  They do?
Great.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.833
   All right, we won.

13:19.866 --> 13:23.470
   Ha, making up,
   oldest trick in the book.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.372
   What do you mean?
Huddle.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.677
  Mr.
  Belding, what are you doing?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.412
  Don't we wanna make
  up with the girls?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.414
  Slater, you give in
  to Jessie now,

13:34.447 --> 13:36.750
   and you're gonna
   be wearing a tutu
   for the rest of your life.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.720
 Zack, you go
 crawling back to Kelly

13:40.754 --> 13:43.723
  and you're gonna be best man
  at Kelly and Todd's wedding.

13:43.757 --> 13:46.292
  What's the deal, fellas?
  I ain't getting any younger.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.765
  Tell them, "Thanks,
  but no thanks."

13:52.432 --> 13:53.566
 Are you sure?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.834
  Are we sure?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.002
   Sure, we're sure.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.404
  We're guys!

13:57.937 --> 13:59.406
You're pathetic.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.546
   ( alarm ringing )

14:18.892 --> 14:20.260
  Good morning, Zack.

14:20.293 --> 14:24.230
  No matter how hard you try,
  you'll never forget me.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.933
   Forget you?
   I don't even know
   your name, Kelly.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.303
  Gosh, she's pretty.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.806
 I've gotta be strong.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.085
   Hi, cutie.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.820
   Kelly, is that you again?

14:46.853 --> 14:49.823
   Of course it's me, Zack.
   I've been waiting for you.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.525
   Kelly, I've been jealous,

14:53.226 --> 14:54.928
but I love you.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.344
 Wear this shirt, Zack.
 I love the way
 it looks on you.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.048
  Gosh, Kelly, I love the way
  everything looks on you.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.317
  Come on, Zack,
  just give me one little hug?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.528
  437.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.863
  Hey, Slater.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.798
 I think I'm losing it.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.535
I know it sounds weird,
but I'm seeing
Kelly's face everywhere.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.337
 I know what you mean,
 Jessie...

15:38.071 --> 15:39.205
 I mean, Zack.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.909
  I see Jessie's face
  everywhere too.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.911
 I even kissed the dog
 thinking it was her.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.215
  Ever kiss a bulldog
  on the lips? Ouch!

15:50.417 --> 15:51.551
 Man, am I in trouble.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.087
 Listen to the message
 on Kelly's
 answering machine...

15:55.321 --> 15:58.458
 Kelly: <i>Hi, if this is Zack,</i>
<i> I'm on my honeymoon with Todd.</i>

15:59.325 --> 16:02.028
 Ooh.
  Pretty rough, huh?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.930
  You oughta hear
  Jessie's message...

16:04.030 --> 16:05.131
  "If this is Slater,

16:05.165 --> 16:08.401
  "take a flying leap
  into a toxic dump."

16:08.435 --> 16:10.870
   Let's face it, we should
   never have listened to Mr.
   Belding.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.506
 You're right.
 He's really
 messing up our lives.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.141
( overlapping dialogue )

16:15.175 --> 16:17.177
Mr. Belding,
what are you doing here?

16:17.210 --> 16:20.780
Hey, nice digs, huh?
This is my bachelor pad.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.517
   I got four showers,
   three stallss,
   and all the towels I want.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.253
  At least you
  don't have to share

16:27.287 --> 16:28.521
  the school with
  your mother-in-law.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.924
 Yeah, and I won't
 share my house either.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.360
We gotta show our women
that we are men.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.261
   I think they know
   that already, sir.

16:35.295 --> 16:39.065
  We are not
  giving up this fight.
  What's the plan for tonight?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.233
 Both: Tonight?

16:40.266 --> 16:41.935
  I got a great idea.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.070
  How about tacos
  and bowling, on me?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.072
( laughing )
   Time out.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.543
My life is a nightmare.
We've gotta get
out of bowling,

16:50.577 --> 16:52.946
get rid of Belding,
and get our babes back.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.147
  And I've got a plan.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.420
   Hello, Palisades Florist?
   I'd like to order
   two dozen roses,

17:00.453 --> 17:03.456
one goes to Mr. Belding
in care of
Bayside High School,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.825
 and the other
 to Mrs. Becky Belding.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.260
 You see these flowers?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.229
  Flowers? They're beautiful.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.498
  Lovely.
  Who might they be from?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.401
 My wife sent them.
 She's caved in, boys.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.469
   She is begging me
   to come home.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.471
 And of course you're
 not going, right, sir?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.040
Well...

17:21.574 --> 17:23.309
  ( whining )

17:24.144 --> 17:26.212
  Not exactly.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.548
 What do you mean?
 Don't you remember our cheer?

17:28.581 --> 17:30.850
 One, two, three, guys!

17:30.884 --> 17:32.452
Guys...

17:32.485 --> 17:35.088
Sir, are you weakening?

17:35.121 --> 17:37.791
 You're not abandoning us now,
 are you, sir?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.427
 She needs me.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.195
I'm her little
whoopie-whoopie.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.231
 Read the card.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.870
 Wow, whoopie-whoopie.
 This is some
 pretty heavy stuff.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.439
Maybe you better go home
to snuggle bunny.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.408
 So you do understand?

17:55.442 --> 17:56.476
  Sure, sure.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.577
 Great!

18:01.848 --> 18:03.883
 Maybe we can have
 our guys' night out next week.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.253
   Oh, no, no, no... You just
   go home to Mrs.
   B, she needs you.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.422
See ya.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.025
  Well, Slater,
  at least we have each other.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.828
Oh, Preppie,
don't you leave me too.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.429
   ( kissing noise )

18:27.407 --> 18:29.376
Jessie, what are
you doing here?

18:29.409 --> 18:33.880
  I got this rose
  from Slater with a note
  begging me to meet him here.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.317
  Wait,
  Zack sent me the same thing.
  What's going on?

18:37.350 --> 18:40.086
   I don't know,
   maybe we should sit down.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.321
Look...

18:48.595 --> 18:50.296
 Good evening, ladies,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.065
  and welcome to the
  "What I Should
  Have Said" theater.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.403
  Our first play stars
  Jessie and Slater.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.806
   The time, three days ago.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.441
   I can't wait for
   Jessie to get here

19:01.474 --> 19:03.910
   so we can plan
   how to celebrate
   our going steady.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.846
   There she is now.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.052
  Oh, Jessie, you look great.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.922
  What I look like
  is not as important
  as what I am, bubba.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.027
 Of course not.
 What a chauvinistic fool I am.

19:21.061 --> 19:23.897
I'm so lucky to have you
point that out
to me every day.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.369
  What do you have planned
  for our
  celebration Saturday night?

19:29.402 --> 19:33.273
  Football tickets
  for the Raiders,
  and they only cost me $100.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.042
 But I have
 tickets to the ballet.

19:36.076 --> 19:40.046
 Who wants to see
 a bunch of barbarians
 kick each other's butt anyway?

19:42.048 --> 19:44.217
  You mean,
  you like the ballet?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.419
  Oh, what does this tell you?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.312
   Hi, Kelly.

20:17.484 --> 20:21.287
 H-I-Z-A-C-K, hi, Zack!

20:24.224 --> 20:27.427
  You know, Kelly, I've always
  loved you in that
  cheerleading outfit.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.497
   It's a little tight.
   I think I have
   my pantyhose on backwards.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.168
 How about celebrating
 our anniversary

20:35.201 --> 20:37.170
with dinner at the beach
Saturday night?

20:37.203 --> 20:38.471
   Oh, Zack, I can't.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.173
   My rich,
   good-looking ex-boyfriend

20:40.206 --> 20:43.376
  is flying in to have dinner
  with M-E, me!

20:45.879 --> 20:47.981
  Oh, you mean, Todd Winfield?

20:48.014 --> 20:51.084
 Isn't it wonderful
 you're still friends
 with him after all this time?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.553
 Don't you mind, Zack?

20:53.586 --> 20:56.156
Why should I mind?
I trust you completely.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.560
Oh, Zack,
you're so understanding.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.862
 I think I'm gonna cry.
 ( blows nose )

21:15.075 --> 21:16.843
   I'm sorry, Kelly.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.412
  Yeah, me too, Mama.
  Will you forgive us?

21:19.446 --> 21:22.115
 After that, how could we not?

21:28.621 --> 21:31.291
   ( crying )

21:33.860 --> 21:35.562
   What are you crying about?

21:35.595 --> 21:39.299
  I have to go to the bathroom
  and I don't know
  which door to go into.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.108
  ( instrumental music plays )
