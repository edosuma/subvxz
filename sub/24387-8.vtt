00:00.013 --> 00:01.181
In a little while you're going to go

00:01.214 --> 00:02.815
before the Iran Directorate.

00:02.848 --> 00:04.785
You're going to speak
about your firsthand knowledge

00:04.817 --> 00:07.220
of the current
uranium enrichment program.

00:07.253 --> 00:08.455
There is no such program.

00:08.487 --> 00:09.789
What evidence

00:09.823 --> 00:11.530
would you have to backup your claim?

00:11.563 --> 00:13.059
<i> They're gonna want verification.</i>

00:13.093 --> 00:14.260
There's no silver bullet.

00:14.294 --> 00:15.996
Intelligence that helps them
complete the picture.

00:16.027 --> 00:17.430
Soil samples, air, water.

00:17.464 --> 00:19.698
Whoever we send that there,
they can't come back.

00:19.732 --> 00:21.101
How are you doing, Jordan?

00:21.133 --> 00:22.769
Like a guy with only the gym
to occupy him.

00:22.802 --> 00:24.315
<i> We have a new landing site.</i>

00:24.347 --> 00:25.871
32,

00:25.904 --> 00:27.706
<i>38, 50 North.</i>

00:27.740 --> 00:29.875
<i>45, 25, 22 East.</i>

00:29.909 --> 00:31.071
They're in position.

00:31.103 --> 00:32.511
Tehran connection playing ball?

00:32.543 --> 00:33.679
Like he was one of us.

00:36.549 --> 00:37.918
Someone's here.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.134 --> 00:57.070
All right. Let's move out.

00:57.103 --> 01:00.340
He's American. He's American.

01:35.308 --> 01:38.244
We're safe. It's all clear. They've gone.

01:38.278 --> 01:40.112
But we need to move. Come on.

01:41.215 --> 01:42.848
Good girl. Come on.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.924
Do you think
that's gonna give us anything?

02:23.956 --> 02:27.293
Honestly, I have no idea.

02:27.326 --> 02:29.462
They didn't stand a chance.

02:31.831 --> 02:34.060
And we just fucking watched.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.540
It's okay.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.278
We need to keep going.

02:46.312 --> 02:48.740
We need to get out of here.

02:49.815 --> 02:51.884
Call Max.

02:54.687 --> 02:57.023
Come.

<i>A group of international scientists...</i>

04:25.210 --> 04:26.612
Hey.

04:26.645 --> 04:30.049
Are you ever a sight for sore eyes. Huh?

04:30.082 --> 04:31.116
Hi, honey.

04:31.150 --> 04:32.786
- Hey.
- How was your trip?

04:32.818 --> 04:35.059
<i> Jordan Franklin was an American hero.</i>

04:35.092 --> 04:36.823
<i>He was the best of us.</i>

04:36.856 --> 04:38.525
<i>His murder, along with five other</i>

04:38.558 --> 04:40.860

- Turn that off. Would you?

04:40.892 --> 04:43.363
<i>...must not go unanswered.</i>

04:50.001 --> 04:51.503
How long are they away for?

04:51.537 --> 04:52.772
Two weeks.

04:52.804 --> 04:53.972
They gave me the keys.

04:54.005 --> 04:56.743
Asked me to water the plants.

04:59.445 --> 05:01.481
Is this another safe house, Max?

05:01.513 --> 05:03.883
Or are they gonna find us here,
like they found us

05:03.916 --> 05:06.019
in the other safe houses?

05:06.620 --> 05:08.955
Come on, girls, let's go to your room.

05:27.873 --> 05:29.842
Right.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.180
Who wants to go on top, who
wants to go on the bottom?

05:33.479 --> 05:35.647
I want to go at the bottom.

05:35.681 --> 05:38.651
- Okay.
- But I don't like blue.

05:38.683 --> 05:40.986
You don't like blue.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.620
Hmm.

05:44.323 --> 05:46.226
I'll tell you what.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.780
Hold him.

05:49.495 --> 05:53.366
If we do... a little bit of this...

05:53.399 --> 05:55.502
and then a little bit of that...

05:59.420 --> 06:00.974
Ta-da.

06:01.007 --> 06:05.145
I miss my room. I want to go home.

06:07.412 --> 06:08.900
Me, too.

06:09.614 --> 06:10.984
And we will.

06:11.017 --> 06:13.086
- When?
- Soon.

06:13.980 --> 06:15.287
You promise?

06:15.320 --> 06:16.688
I promise.

06:16.722 --> 06:18.657
Do you pinky promise?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.562
I pinky promise.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.700
We need to get you two in the bath.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.237
Are you gonna come home with us?

06:57.063 --> 06:58.565
There's no ham.

06:58.597 --> 07:00.232
Lola will only eat ham.

07:00.265 --> 07:03.770
What am I supposed to do?

07:03.803 --> 07:06.072
We'll go out and get some.

07:06.104 --> 07:08.707
How? Who will go?

07:08.741 --> 07:11.377
We can't even leave the...

07:11.409 --> 07:12.845
Hey, hey.

07:14.013 --> 07:16.181
Come here.

07:20.286 --> 07:22.188
What you did,

07:23.380 --> 07:25.725
you had no choice.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.293
You had to do it.

07:27.325 --> 07:28.861
You had to do it, you understand?

07:28.895 --> 07:32.065
And who put me in that position?

07:33.465 --> 07:35.540
You tell me that.

07:43.301 --> 07:45.311
He's considering his options.

07:45.344 --> 07:46.913
Am I missing something?

07:46.945 --> 07:49.515
We have the most trigger-happy
president in history

07:49.549 --> 07:52.318
and six dead American heroes
in the Iranian dirt.

07:52.351 --> 07:54.387
The president is his own man.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.424
You mean he's a fucking child
who can't make up his mind.

08:01.205 --> 08:03.508
600,000 pairs of boots.

08:05.492 --> 08:07.400
Four million pairs of socks.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.412
Two million T-shirts.

08:10.856 --> 08:14.380
1,400,000 desert fatigues.

08:15.106 --> 08:16.809
3,600,000...

08:19.311 --> 08:21.380
How are we coming along?

08:21.414 --> 08:26.452
Uh, $900,282,000.65.

08:26.484 --> 08:28.260
You couldn't round it up?

08:28.820 --> 08:30.210
What about fuel?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.791
Haven't started on that yet, sir.

08:31.824 --> 08:34.327
Got up to $600 a gallon

08:34.359 --> 08:36.740
to deliver to the battlefield
in Afghanistan.

08:37.296 --> 08:40.666
Let's see if we can't top that this time.

08:48.740 --> 08:50.690
Put another ten percent on boots.

08:50.724 --> 08:52.030
We just do that?

08:52.055 --> 08:56.083
In Djibouti we charged the DOD
$25.5 million for a gym.

08:57.115 --> 08:58.182
Trust me.

08:58.629 --> 09:01.087
We can add another ten percent on boots.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.519
<i>- Listen, I've told you not to...</i>
- You fucked me.

09:34.552 --> 09:36.722
<i>We had agreement. And you fucked me.</i>

09:36.756 --> 09:38.725
<i>Do you think there won't be
no consequences?</i>

09:38.758 --> 09:40.893
There will be fucking consequences.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.685
<i>- Pullman.</i>
- I need good news.

10:05.718 --> 10:09.188
<i>- Max Easton?</i>
- He, uh...

10:10.300 --> 10:11.791
slipped through the net.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.180
Christ.

10:15.620 --> 10:16.796
The family?

10:17.260 --> 10:18.631
All of them.

10:18.663 --> 10:20.298
<i>Jesus Christ, Seth, you're gonna give me</i>

10:20.331 --> 10:22.110
a fucking migraine. Find them!

10:39.397 --> 10:42.351
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.801
- Harry.
- Hi.

10:44.835 --> 10:45.921
Hey.

10:45.954 --> 10:46.968
Are you all right?

10:47.001 --> 10:48.928
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's this?

10:48.960 --> 10:51.142
Uh, this is my sister.

10:51.175 --> 10:52.628
Chloe.

10:54.878 --> 10:56.313
<i>Enchant√©.</i>

11:02.353 --> 11:04.856
They've had a long journey. Come on.

11:04.888 --> 11:06.580
Let's get 'em something to eat.

11:08.091 --> 11:11.228
"'You are in a great hurry,
then, ' said Fix to him one day,

11:11.262 --> 11:13.131
'to reach Hong Kong?'"

11:14.337 --> 11:17.541
- Max? Max.
- Hmm.

11:19.135 --> 11:21.272
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:27.198 --> 11:28.967
We've got no proof of anything.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.357
No defector,

11:30.390 --> 11:33.571
no drone strike, no power plants.

11:33.604 --> 11:35.060
We've got nothing concrete.

11:35.672 --> 11:38.300
All we've got is some blood in the sand.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.144
So what do we do with it?

11:59.597 --> 12:01.600
I was going to make a cup of tea,

12:01.632 --> 12:03.180
but you've only got soy milk.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.984
I don't know how you can drink
that stuff.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.758
I'm calling the police.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.840
Jordan Franklin
was killed by an American.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.877
They're gonna bomb a weapons facility

12:12.911 --> 12:15.500
that doesn't exist, then they're
gonna go to war with Iran.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.783
All based on nothing.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.452
Just like last time.

12:22.453 --> 12:24.020
Only this time...

12:25.460 --> 12:27.691
there's a chance we can get
the truth out there.

12:27.724 --> 12:28.926
You think that'll do any good?

12:28.959 --> 12:30.420
I don't know.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.265
But which side of this thing
do you want to be on?

12:36.233 --> 12:38.637
I need you to run some bloods.

13:40.531 --> 13:42.066
The blood sample was contaminated,

13:42.099 --> 13:44.069
but we managed to get
some partial results.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.438
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Sending them over now.

13:49.660 --> 13:53.045
There's over 200,000 partial matches.

13:54.045 --> 13:55.814
Okay, um,

13:55.847 --> 13:58.783
how many of those
are Americans who served?

13:59.816 --> 14:01.887
149.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.257
Any of them working private security?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.028
62.

14:16.233 --> 14:17.980
Stop.

14:18.468 --> 14:20.140
There.

14:21.506 --> 14:22.874
That's him.

14:22.906 --> 14:24.508
He was there.

14:24.541 --> 14:26.644
Major Andrew Jackson.

14:26.678 --> 14:28.540
Let's see if we can find out
where he lives.

14:31.780 --> 14:33.818
Someone will be in the house
the whole time

14:33.851 --> 14:35.460
to protect you and the girls.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.824
Will they have a gun?

14:40.660 --> 14:42.100
They will.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.901
Anna,

14:49.934 --> 14:51.780
I'm doing everything I can.

14:59.444 --> 15:00.846
I have to go.

15:03.359 --> 15:04.628
Max.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.320
Be careful.

15:12.893 --> 15:14.300
Yeah.

16:41.145 --> 16:43.213
<i> Tehran has released a taped confession</i>

16:43.247 --> 16:45.282
<i>from an Iranian
intelligence officer who claims</i>

16:45.315 --> 16:48.252
<i>the U.S. government
was responsible for the deaths</i>

16:48.286 --> 16:51.890
<i>of the six Americans near the
Alin nuclear weapons facility.</i>

17:01.398 --> 17:03.400
<i>Sources close to the
White House are saying tonight</i>

17:03.434 --> 17:05.301
<i>they expect the president

17:07.672 --> 17:08.836
<i>within the next few hours.</i>

17:08.867 --> 17:10.420
It's Jones.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.713
Don't take it.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.383
<i> You've reached Collins.</i>

17:18.415 --> 17:20.719
<i>Please leave a messa...</i>

17:22.720 --> 17:25.099
She's become a problem.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.657
It's time to get rid of her.

17:40.149 --> 17:41.355
<i> Would all passengers</i>

17:41.389 --> 17:44.059

<i>please make your way to Gate 17?</i>

17:46.294 --> 17:48.598
<i>That's Gate 17 for...</i>

17:48.630 --> 17:50.399
You got to see this.

17:55.356 --> 17:57.940
Look who showed up at Dulles Airport.

18:04.013 --> 18:05.580
Where are you staying?

18:05.614 --> 18:07.283
The Willard.

18:07.316 --> 18:08.751
Nice.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.418
Who's footing the bill?

18:10.452 --> 18:12.655
This trip is a celebration.

18:12.687 --> 18:14.322
Long, long overdue.

18:14.356 --> 18:15.940
What are you celebrating?

18:18.320 --> 18:20.140
My divorce.

18:21.897 --> 18:24.433
If she's here,
they've got something on us.

18:25.460 --> 18:27.035
I want to know what it is.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.038
Let her go. Follow her.

18:32.460 --> 18:34.443
<i> Based on the projected bombing campaign</i>

18:34.475 --> 18:35.444
<i>of Tehran...</i>

18:35.476 --> 18:38.179
Using the Baghdad model.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.750
Uh-huh. We're looking at an increase

18:40.782 --> 18:43.772
in our construction turnover
of $2 billion.

18:43.866 --> 18:47.923
I want to avoid any,
uh, unseemly profiteering.

18:47.956 --> 18:50.959
God knows last time
it gave me a stomach ulcer.

18:50.993 --> 18:54.797
It's about jobs for the Iranian people.

18:54.830 --> 18:57.403
They drive the rebuilding
of their own country,

18:57.435 --> 19:01.137
fate in their own hands,
so on and so forth.

19:01.169 --> 19:03.605
Now, all construction
on this goes through,

19:03.638 --> 19:04.785
uh...

19:04.819 --> 19:06.841
Mashadan Construction, out of Tehran.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.345
In whom one of our subsidiaries

19:09.378 --> 19:11.672
recently acquired a majority stake.

19:11.705 --> 19:14.349
When can we expect the go-ahead
from the president?

19:14.382 --> 19:16.851
The man tweets like a teenage girl.

19:16.885 --> 19:19.588
You really think we're gonna
leave this up to him?

19:20.500 --> 19:22.557
And we're assuming a surgical strike

19:22.590 --> 19:24.860
will be enough to meet our projections?

19:31.833 --> 19:34.369
The Eskan housing complex

19:34.403 --> 19:37.573
30 miles from the Alin Power Plant.

19:37.606 --> 19:39.175
In the second wave of launches,

19:39.207 --> 19:42.744
one of our cruise missiles
will veer off course.

19:42.778 --> 19:45.982
I think you'll find things
will escalate pretty quickly

19:46.014 --> 19:47.660
from there.

20:03.629 --> 20:05.001
So, what happened? Why the delay?

20:05.033 --> 20:07.469
They took me for secondary interview.

20:07.503 --> 20:09.271
And?

20:09.940 --> 20:12.007
Nothing.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.876
They let me go.

20:13.908 --> 20:16.178
Which means they know we're here.

20:28.780 --> 20:29.992
Max.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.761
Hey, Bob.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.362
He looks nothing like you.

20:34.396 --> 20:35.931
Yeah.

20:35.964 --> 20:37.700
Lucky for him.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.069
Thanks for helping us out.

20:40.101 --> 20:42.070
Whatever you need.

21:08.123 --> 21:09.860
Hello?

21:21.609 --> 21:23.612
Hello?

22:08.223 --> 22:10.658
What are we looking for?

22:10.692 --> 22:13.463
Anything that tells us
who Jackson's working for.

22:32.780 --> 22:33.983
They're out at the end

22:34.015 --> 22:34.984
<i>of Blazer Lane.</i>

22:35.016 --> 22:37.018
That's Jackson's place.

22:38.937 --> 22:40.555
Let's go.

22:50.090 --> 22:51.660
They're here.

22:54.468 --> 22:56.437
Go. Out the back.

22:56.968 --> 22:58.808
I'll buy us some time.

23:19.427 --> 23:21.330
Come on.

23:21.362 --> 23:22.964
Stay with me.

23:32.174 --> 23:33.541
Come on.

23:35.077 --> 23:36.378
Okay, okay.

23:43.185 --> 23:44.552
Give me your hand.

23:44.586 --> 23:46.922
Put this on.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.740
Hold that tight.

24:09.410 --> 24:10.411
Thought you'd gone.

24:10.445 --> 24:12.581
What, and leave you on your own?

24:34.069 --> 24:36.839
Cease fire! Cease fire!

24:44.720 --> 24:46.147
Fuck.

24:47.220 --> 24:50.118
And we let three isolated,

24:50.151 --> 24:52.920
useless fucking Brits
slip through our fingers?

24:52.954 --> 24:54.623
Let me use Metro or the Bureau.

24:54.656 --> 24:56.820
And lose control of this
more than I already have?

25:06.020 --> 25:08.803
You need to tell Collins they're here.

25:08.837 --> 25:10.260
Yeah.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.100
And how do you think that ends for me?

25:33.635 --> 25:36.536
Right. Over here.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.455
Oh!

25:49.845 --> 25:51.740
Stay still.

25:59.748 --> 26:01.620
Keep still.

26:08.996 --> 26:11.032
It's done.

26:11.066 --> 26:13.969
It's done.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.178
You okay?

26:25.130 --> 26:26.340
Yeah.

26:26.931 --> 26:28.460
She's a fighter.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.660
Most stubborn woman I've ever met.

26:33.220 --> 26:34.907
Apart from your mother.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.681
Have you found anything
from Jackson's documents?

26:44.260 --> 26:46.689
He's got a daughter in the second grade,

26:46.722 --> 26:48.786
his favorite film's <i> The Big Lebowski,</i>

26:48.819 --> 26:50.900
and his wife's late
with the car payments.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.258
Nothing useful.

26:56.121 --> 26:59.190
Yeah, we've come a long way
to hit a dead end.

27:13.260 --> 27:15.046
Thanks.

27:30.958 --> 27:33.097
Here, Greenburg, Morgan & Squire.

27:33.130 --> 27:34.599
What's that?

27:34.632 --> 27:36.934
Washington law firm.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.870
Why would they be paying
Jackson's mortgage?

27:41.900 --> 27:43.475
Commercial law.

27:43.507 --> 27:47.546
Hmm. But no links
to anything political? Military?

27:49.068 --> 27:50.155
Hmm.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.550
Nothing I can find.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.238
They got over 200 lawyers.

27:54.271 --> 27:55.653
Which one's Jackson's?

27:55.687 --> 27:56.955
No idea.

27:56.988 --> 27:59.340
Maybe I can help you find out.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.996
Big firm like that.

28:04.340 --> 28:07.199
Receptionist might not know
what Jackson's wife looks like.

28:09.164 --> 28:11.934
- It's worth a shot.
- Uh, you need to rest.

28:11.966 --> 28:14.460
Don't tell me what to do, Harry.

28:15.698 --> 28:17.540
It never ends well.

28:31.688 --> 28:33.824
Hi there. I'm Mrs. Cathy Jackson.

28:33.856 --> 28:35.425
I have an appointment
with my husband's attorney.

28:35.459 --> 28:36.626
And your husband's name?

28:36.660 --> 28:38.128
Uh, Andrew.

28:38.161 --> 28:39.662
Uh, An-Andrew Jackson.

28:39.695 --> 28:42.865
Um, I don't have anything in the books.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.370
I swear, I can't leave him
to arrange anything.

28:46.403 --> 28:48.806
Don't get me started.
My husband's the same way.

28:48.838 --> 28:50.374
I'll try giving him a call.

28:50.406 --> 28:52.576
He probably won't pick up.
He's so slammed at work.

28:52.608 --> 28:54.477
Y-You know what. It's okay.
Um, I can call

28:54.510 --> 28:56.613
- Mr. Collins' assistant.
- Oh, would you?

28:56.645 --> 28:58.883
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

29:01.151 --> 29:04.388
Hi, Lynne. Yeah, does Martin
have an appointment with...?

29:04.421 --> 29:06.757
Oh, my... oh, my God. Are you all right?

29:09.159 --> 29:11.128
Oh, it's fine.

29:11.161 --> 29:13.431
Don't worry about it.
It's, uh... yeah, it's fine.

29:15.364 --> 29:18.100
There's no Martin Collins listed
at Greenburg.

29:19.980 --> 29:23.941
No paralegal, no assistant,
no intern, no nothing.

29:25.642 --> 29:28.045
Try Burnett Hanson in the cache.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.780
It's the law firm where Omar

29:30.814 --> 29:32.115
and Ardavan met.

29:32.149 --> 29:34.140
Closed down two years ago.

29:34.750 --> 29:39.088
Hey, there. Collins was listed
in the HR department

29:39.122 --> 29:40.990
at Burnett Hanson.

29:41.024 --> 29:44.028
And now he shows up
as Andrew Jackson's lawyer.

29:45.020 --> 29:47.196
Maybe he's the one
they didn't want you to find.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.780
Maybe he's the reason
you ended up on the kill list.

29:52.069 --> 29:53.860
Here. One sec.

29:59.142 --> 30:02.046
Collins was at Georgetown in '96.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.662
What?

30:19.260 --> 30:21.097
Do you recognize her?

30:23.232 --> 30:25.060
Amanda Jones.

30:25.734 --> 30:28.505
The drone strike press
conference. She was there.

30:30.739 --> 30:33.477
Oh, she and Collins went
to Georgetown together.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.247
Okay, so Collins connects
Andrew Jackson and Amanda Jones.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.884
Attorney-client privilege?

30:40.916 --> 30:42.718
Maybe they were using his office
to communicate.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.021
There's got to be more to it
than just them.

30:45.055 --> 30:46.923
There's got to be someone else involved.

30:46.957 --> 30:49.326
Collins is a civilian.
That's probably why they didn't

30:49.358 --> 30:50.900
want you to find him.

30:52.962 --> 30:54.700
He's the weak link.

31:37.941 --> 31:39.910
Take the wife.

31:39.942 --> 31:42.912
- Take the fucking wife!
- Honey!

31:42.945 --> 31:46.849
Honey! Honey!

31:46.883 --> 31:48.986
No.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.107
Let's go.

32:14.076 --> 32:15.845
In here, in here, in here. Here.

32:24.487 --> 32:26.732
Fuck!

32:26.764 --> 32:28.392
- Leyla, Leyla.
- I can manage.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.748
Stop being so stubborn
for once in your life.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.730
Please.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.505
Oh.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.850
Thank you.

32:59.073 --> 33:00.123
You okay?

33:00.620 --> 33:01.991
I'm fine.

33:02.460 --> 33:04.580
Didn't have to take his wife.

34:02.951 --> 34:04.320
Max?

34:04.354 --> 34:05.689
Sorry if I woke you.

34:05.721 --> 34:06.922
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

34:06.955 --> 34:08.491
Are you hurt?

34:08.524 --> 34:10.179
<i>No, I'm fine, I...</i>

34:11.139 --> 34:12.940
I just need to hear them.

34:14.580 --> 34:15.931
Okay.

34:40.656 --> 34:42.179
Thank you.

35:09.419 --> 35:11.221
Tell me who you work for.

35:11.254 --> 35:13.924
I...

35:15.959 --> 35:17.527
Tell me who you work for!

35:17.560 --> 35:21.131
They'll kill me. I tell you,
they... they'll kill me.

35:31.815 --> 35:33.810
Come here.

35:42.151 --> 35:44.190
No, please.

35:44.223 --> 35:47.523
Please, no, she's not involved!
Please, I'm begging you.

35:47.557 --> 35:49.658
My kids weren't involved!

35:49.692 --> 35:52.095
All right, my youngest is
seven fucking years old.

35:52.127 --> 35:54.430
She's been chased, she's been shot at,

35:54.464 --> 35:55.665
- she's been terrified.
- I had nothing to do with that.

35:55.698 --> 35:57.734
I swear. I'm begging you!

35:57.767 --> 35:59.510
- It wasn't me!
- Then who was it?!

35:59.542 --> 36:02.538
Huh? Who?

36:05.542 --> 36:07.877
- Fuck it. On your knees.
- Oh.

36:07.910 --> 36:09.512
- No.
- No, Max.

36:09.546 --> 36:11.114
Max, no, enough! Stop!

36:11.147 --> 36:12.125
- Enough!
- Back off!

36:12.150 --> 36:13.092
Max!

36:15.084 --> 36:16.453
No. No!

36:18.321 --> 36:19.723
Okay, okay!

36:20.756 --> 36:22.291
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

36:23.292 --> 36:24.660
I'll tell you!

36:28.751 --> 36:29.833
Please.

36:29.866 --> 36:31.401
Please.

36:31.433 --> 36:33.102
Ah, God, no.

36:56.825 --> 36:58.828
Begin.

37:06.368 --> 37:08.370
I have it.

37:08.404 --> 37:10.440
I need someone I can take it to.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.709
Someone with influence.

37:12.741 --> 37:14.500
I'll see what I can dig up.

37:15.111 --> 37:16.540
Bye.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.340
That must be some breakfast.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.005
- Excuse me?
- I mean, if you've been coming

37:43.038 --> 37:44.540
here for 20 years.

37:48.243 --> 37:50.180
What is it, the eggs?

37:50.212 --> 37:53.260
I come because... I get left alone.

37:59.421 --> 38:02.925
Why do I get the feeling you're
not going to introduce yourself?

38:04.180 --> 38:05.928
Senator Burrell,

38:05.962 --> 38:08.300
you won't want this to be overheard.

38:26.256 --> 38:27.824
<i>My name is Martin Collins.</i>

38:28.205 --> 38:31.654
<i>I'm an attorney
at Greenburg, Morgan & Squire.</i>

38:32.260 --> 38:37.259
<i>My client... my only client...
is William Kingsley</i>

38:37.292 --> 38:39.628
<i>of Kingsley Merchant Proctor Hall,</i>

38:39.662 --> 38:41.997
<i>an engineering and construction company</i>

38:42.031 --> 38:45.869
<i>with subsidiaries in defense
and private security.</i>

38:46.500 --> 38:50.980
<i>They made $40 billion from the Iraq War.</i>

38:51.741 --> 38:53.710
<i>After that, they set about trying</i>

38:53.743 --> 38:55.712
<i>to ensure those kinds of returns.</i>

38:56.180 --> 39:01.051
<i>To that end they infiltrated
the intelligence services</i>

39:01.620 --> 39:03.819
<i>to act on their behalf.</i>

39:03.852 --> 39:06.727
<i>Their key contact is Amanda Jones,</i>

39:06.761 --> 39:10.594
<i>a senior supervisor at the
Central Intelligence Agency.</i>

39:11.580 --> 39:16.180
<i>There is no active Iranian
nuclear weapons program.</i>

39:16.758 --> 39:20.270
<i>Jordan Franklin and his
colleagues were not killed</i>

39:20.303 --> 39:22.672
<i>by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</i>

39:22.705 --> 39:27.444
<i>This is the long arm
of KMPH and others like them.</i>

39:28.180 --> 39:30.480
<i>Governments come and go.</i>

39:30.513 --> 39:33.116
<i>These guys are forever.</i>

39:34.817 --> 39:38.188
<i>They determine who to bomb,
where to invade.</i>

39:38.221 --> 39:42.392
<i>They build the drones,
the Hellfire missiles</i>

39:42.424 --> 39:45.227
<i>that destroy the homes, the factories.</i>

39:45.261 --> 39:48.198
<i>Then they get the contracts
to rebuild those same homes,</i>

39:48.230 --> 39:50.540
<i>those same factories.</i>

39:51.567 --> 39:53.740
<i>Cash from chaos.</i>

39:54.710 --> 39:56.020
<i>War on terror.</i>

39:57.420 --> 39:59.475
<i>War in perpetuity.</i>

40:15.020 --> 40:16.926
I can't do anything with this.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.820
I'm sorry?

40:21.296 --> 40:23.940
You bring me this guy,

40:24.633 --> 40:27.569
he tells me where the bodies are buried,

40:27.602 --> 40:31.206
maybe, maybe I can do
something with that.

40:31.239 --> 40:32.808
Maybe.

40:40.140 --> 40:41.900
What, that's it?

40:42.451 --> 40:43.940
What do you want me to say?

40:45.060 --> 40:50.100
People aren't interested
in the truth anymore.

40:52.981 --> 40:55.340
It doesn't play like it used to.

41:52.053 --> 41:54.256
I can't get ahold of Collins.

41:54.290 --> 41:57.427
He's not at home. His wife's not at home.

41:57.899 --> 42:00.420
There anything you want to tell me?

42:06.420 --> 42:07.803
No, sir.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.973
Okay.

42:10.006 --> 42:12.580
I'm gonna choose to believe you.

42:16.745 --> 42:20.482
The president's wavering
on his decision to bomb Tehran.

42:20.515 --> 42:23.660
This will give him the nudge
he's looking for.

42:30.060 --> 42:32.694
I started out as a roughneck.

42:32.727 --> 42:35.030
Lowest position you can get on a rig.

42:35.064 --> 42:37.200
- Did you know that?
- No.

42:37.232 --> 42:40.269
No one handed me a damn thing.

42:40.740 --> 42:42.438
First desk job I got,

42:42.940 --> 42:44.239
hired an assistant.

42:44.272 --> 42:46.041
Margaret.

42:46.075 --> 42:47.676
Beautiful woman.

42:47.709 --> 42:50.460
Paid her out of my own salary.
Always did.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.260
She passed on last year.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.118
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.854
40 years, she worked for me.

42:58.888 --> 43:01.090
By my side every day.

43:01.122 --> 43:03.058
Hell,

43:03.091 --> 43:06.100
she knew me better than my wife.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.220
Collins turned on you.

43:11.901 --> 43:14.604
The moment Esfahani's confession
hit the screen.

43:14.636 --> 43:17.060
Took him all of about two seconds.

43:18.380 --> 43:21.460
People don't understand
the value of loyalty.

43:22.645 --> 43:25.620
He's a white-shoe errand boy.

43:27.149 --> 43:29.118
You play this right,

43:29.151 --> 43:32.180
maybe we change the way we do things.

43:44.660 --> 43:48.504
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

43:48.537 --> 43:50.620
Is there somewhere we can talk?

43:58.540 --> 44:00.183
What's this about?

44:00.216 --> 44:04.120
You are gonna give this to
the president's chief of staff.

44:04.827 --> 44:07.390
The president was on a trip to Dubai.

44:07.422 --> 44:08.825
Well, he wasn't the president then,

44:08.857 --> 44:10.420
but still.

44:12.260 --> 44:15.220
We're all trying to escape
our pasts, aren't we?

44:17.265 --> 44:19.660
There's plenty more where that came from.

44:20.820 --> 44:23.805
I serve the American people.

44:24.180 --> 44:26.442
I am not your bitch.

44:26.475 --> 44:28.011
1992.

44:28.044 --> 44:29.245
Kentucky lower house.

44:29.278 --> 44:31.480
Ken Stolt, your opponent,

44:31.513 --> 44:34.020
had a heart attack, if I recall.

44:35.060 --> 44:36.685
You were elected unopposed.

44:36.718 --> 44:39.488
1998, you made it all the way
to the U.S. Senate.

44:39.522 --> 44:42.225
Lucky. Mike Connolly,
your opponent in that race,

44:42.900 --> 44:45.774
he found himself beset
by personal problems,

44:45.807 --> 44:47.100
didn't he?

44:47.562 --> 44:50.066
Wasn't much of a contest then either.

44:50.098 --> 44:52.265
See, we've been looking out for you

44:52.299 --> 44:54.504
before you were even aware of it.

44:54.537 --> 44:59.060
You will be anything
we say you are, Senator.

45:09.438 --> 45:11.007
<i>Sources close to the White House</i>

45:11.040 --> 45:12.609
<i>are saying tonight
they expect the president</i>

45:12.643 --> 45:14.345
<i>to order a strike on the Alin</i>

45:14.377 --> 45:18.381
<i>nuclear weapons facility
within the next few hours.</i>

45:27.020 --> 45:29.393
You're a hard man to find.

45:29.860 --> 45:31.629
I wouldn't press that if I were you.

45:31.661 --> 45:34.165
Not if you want Collins back.

45:57.779 --> 46:00.149
She's got your eyes.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.572
Evie, right?

46:04.340 --> 46:05.907
I've got a couple of my own,

46:05.939 --> 46:08.075
but you know that already.

46:08.108 --> 46:09.777
It wasn't my call.

46:09.811 --> 46:11.113
Yeah.

46:11.146 --> 46:13.340
I've heard that a lot lately.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.653
I sit with Chloe, my daughter,

46:19.140 --> 46:21.455
before she goes to sleep.

46:21.940 --> 46:24.258
She tells me about her day.

46:24.291 --> 46:27.060
Rabbits away. Can't get her to shut up.

46:28.940 --> 46:30.298
Only now she's gonna talk to me

46:30.332 --> 46:32.200
about people chasing her with guns.

46:32.233 --> 46:34.180
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

46:37.980 --> 46:41.543
It's lucky for you,
I'm not here to get even.

46:41.575 --> 46:43.744
Not this time, anyway.

46:43.778 --> 46:47.716
<i>They made $40 billion from the Iraq War.</i>

46:47.749 --> 46:49.451
<i>After that, they set about trying</i>

46:49.483 --> 46:51.452
<i>to ensure those kinds of returns.</i>

46:51.486 --> 46:55.157
<i>To that end, they infiltrated
the intelligence services</i>

46:55.189 --> 46:56.557
<i>to act on their behalf.</i>

46:56.590 --> 46:57.591
<i>Their key contact</i>

46:57.624 --> 46:59.126
<i>is Amanda Jones,</i>

46:59.160 --> 47:01.530
<i>the senior supervisor at...</i>

47:01.912 --> 47:03.599
You get the idea.

47:05.300 --> 47:09.870
If anything happens to me or my family,

47:10.380 --> 47:12.100
this gets out there.

47:13.420 --> 47:16.180
And suddenly you're a problem for them.

47:55.060 --> 47:56.585
Why didn't you take the wife?

47:56.619 --> 47:58.986
You didn't take him to Burrell, did you?

47:59.019 --> 48:01.260
Took him to Amanda Jones.

48:02.540 --> 48:04.693
What, you sold us out?

48:06.100 --> 48:07.195
No.

48:08.420 --> 48:11.099
She now has a vested interest
in our safety.

48:11.131 --> 48:12.733
She'll fucking bury it.

48:12.767 --> 48:14.669
We had a chance to get the truth out...

48:14.702 --> 48:15.964
We had a chance.

48:15.996 --> 48:17.773
Okay. I can see you're disappointed.

48:17.805 --> 48:19.300
What's new?

48:20.073 --> 48:22.510
I've always been disappointed in you.

48:22.544 --> 48:23.663
You could've changed that.

48:23.696 --> 48:25.247
What, by taking Collins to Burrell?

48:25.280 --> 48:28.883
By doing the right thing. For once.

48:28.916 --> 48:31.668
And what do you think
would have happened? Huh?

48:31.702 --> 48:33.660
I'll tell you what would have happened.

48:33.988 --> 48:35.706
We would have handed him over,

48:35.739 --> 48:37.325
the press would've had a field
day for a couple of weeks,

48:37.358 --> 48:38.727
maybe a couple of months.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.196
The government would have had
their inquiry,

48:41.229 --> 48:42.842
a token head would have rolled,

48:42.875 --> 48:44.733
and then everything would have
been exactly the same

48:44.765 --> 48:45.800
as it was before.

48:45.834 --> 48:47.569
We would have stood for something.

48:47.602 --> 48:50.038
And this miserable fucking mess
might've been worth it.

48:50.070 --> 48:51.706
Well, when the dust has settled,

48:51.738 --> 48:54.508
and everyone's focus is
on the next big scandal,

48:54.541 --> 48:55.777
you know what would've happened?

48:57.205 --> 48:58.640
They would've come for us.

48:58.665 --> 49:01.102
They would have come for you, for me.

49:01.127 --> 49:03.197
For Chloe and Lola. All of us.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.590
I bought us our freedom.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.180
Got us our lives back.

49:15.316 --> 49:17.420
Now, you might not like
the way I've done it...

49:18.738 --> 49:21.046
but it's over. You understand?

49:28.776 --> 49:30.500
Now we get to go home.

49:51.839 --> 49:52.975
Sir?

49:57.070 --> 49:58.739
We need to put a hold on Iran.

49:58.773 --> 50:01.309
And why in God's name would we do that?

50:01.341 --> 50:02.740
To contain the fallout.

50:03.311 --> 50:04.900
From what?

50:05.273 --> 50:07.175
<i> My only client is William Kingsley</i>

50:07.200 --> 50:08.969
<i>of Kingsley Merchant Proctor Hall.</i>

50:08.994 --> 50:13.132
<i>They made $40 billion from the Iraq war.</i>

50:13.157 --> 50:15.105
<i>After that, they set about
trying to ensure</i>

50:15.130 --> 50:16.457
<i>those kinds of returns...</i>

50:16.490 --> 50:17.791
You just made yourself

50:17.825 --> 50:19.593
a major liability, Amanda.

50:19.626 --> 50:22.764
No, what I've done is tie
our futures together, sir.

50:23.890 --> 50:26.540
I disappear, this tape gets released.

50:28.570 --> 50:31.872
I want more say in future operations,

50:31.905 --> 50:33.674
and I want a greater cut of the deal.

50:36.077 --> 50:38.046
Who got to Collins?

50:38.079 --> 50:42.180
A former asset. Max Easton.

50:45.519 --> 50:49.523
All right, we'll put it
on hold... for now.

50:49.557 --> 50:51.392
Tie up the loose ends.

50:51.425 --> 50:53.060
I'll do that.

50:55.930 --> 50:57.900
Max Easton.

50:58.466 --> 51:01.270
I'd like to keep him around.
He could prove useful.

51:03.403 --> 51:05.860
Let me think about that one.

51:10.544 --> 51:12.646
<i> The White House today
announced that the president</i>

51:12.680 --> 51:16.985
<i>is prepared to give a chance to
last-minute diplomatic attempts</i>

51:17.017 --> 51:20.555
<i>at finding a peaceful
resolution to the Iran crisis.</i>

51:22.100 --> 51:23.758
How did you do it?

51:23.791 --> 51:25.327
After the Lebanon fiasco,

51:25.360 --> 51:27.329
your career's on life-support.

51:27.361 --> 51:29.380
And now you get my desk?

51:30.497 --> 51:32.900
I can come back later
if you need more time.

52:03.997 --> 52:06.133
<i> With Iran on hold,</i>

52:06.166 --> 52:10.345
we need to look at other ideas
to make up the shortfall

52:10.379 --> 52:12.707
in our quarterly projections.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.175
I've been looking at the Yemen.

52:14.207 --> 52:16.340
Lots of instability over there.

52:16.791 --> 52:20.088
Given a nudge or two, could bring us

52:20.113 --> 52:22.740
some decent opportunities.

52:26.740 --> 52:28.084
<i> Yes.</i>

52:28.117 --> 52:31.393
<i> There are 854,000 contract personnel</i>

52:31.425 --> 52:33.128
<i>with top secret clearances...</i>

52:33.162 --> 52:35.424
<i>a number greater than that
of cleared civilian employees</i>

52:35.457 --> 52:36.563
<i>of the government.</i>

52:36.597 --> 52:38.332
<i>Is that something that concerns you?</i>

52:38.365 --> 52:40.467
<i>We are a model for how the
state can work effectively</i>

52:40.501 --> 52:42.070
<i>with private contractors,</i>

52:42.102 --> 52:43.570
<i>and that is something
we intend to expand.</i>

52:43.604 --> 52:45.340
<i> These contractors are setting</i>

52:45.372 --> 52:47.441
<i>the direction for the country
without being subject</i>

52:47.474 --> 52:49.443
<i>to congressional hearings or oversight.</i>

52:49.477 --> 52:52.347
<i> These are brave American men and women</i>

52:52.379 --> 52:54.381
<i>who make an invaluable contribution</i>

52:54.414 --> 52:56.183
<i>to the national security of this country.</i>

52:56.216 --> 52:57.700
<i>They keep us safe.</i>

52:58.519 --> 53:00.053
<i>All of us, you included.</i>

53:26.581 --> 53:27.981
Daddy!

53:28.015 --> 53:30.552
Daddy, Daddy.

53:30.584 --> 53:31.952
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy! Daddy!

53:32.986 --> 53:35.557
Hey. Hey. Hey.

53:43.164 --> 53:44.399
Come on, let's get back in the pool.

53:44.432 --> 53:46.401
- Come on.
- You go, you go.
