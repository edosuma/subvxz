00:01.008 --> 00:02.084
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:03.004 --> 00:04.088
Oliver topped second year
last year.

00:05.008 --> 00:07.024
Do you think there's anything
you can teach him?

00:07.044 --> 00:11.092
I don't play favourites but
he was my first long-term patient.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.028
He still sends flowers
on my birthday.

00:15.032 --> 00:16.076
And your dad?

00:16.096 --> 00:18.060
He hung around long enough
to change a couple of nappies

00:18.076 --> 00:20.008
and then he lost interest.

00:20.028 --> 00:21.084
You know how I said
we can't be friends?

00:22.092 --> 00:24.036
You're breaking the rules, dude.

00:24.056 --> 00:27.052
When I kissed you, that's something
I wanted to do for a long time.

00:28.056 --> 00:32.052
I know where my dad is! I choose
not to have anything to do with him!

00:39.337 --> 00:41.354
when you don't know
where you come from,

00:41.369 --> 00:43.366
you have all these questions

00:43.386 --> 00:48.312
about your mannerisms,
your failures,

00:48.327 --> 00:50.308
even the stuff you're OK at.

00:51.312 --> 00:54.321
You don't know if they're inherited
from someone you never knew

00:54.337 --> 00:56.346
or whether they belong to you.

01:04.396 --> 01:07.377
Forget books, forget blogging.

01:07.397 --> 01:10.406
This is how stories were told
for thousands of years.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.318
The body was the pen and paper.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:24.346 --> 01:26.327
Alright, you have an assignment.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.384
Every single one of us
has a unique story,

01:28.399 --> 01:31.344
a history that's shaped us.

01:31.364 --> 01:34.381
I want you guys to choose one of
these defining moments in your life

01:36.362 --> 01:38.378
and I want you to perform it
to the class on Thursday.

01:41.347 --> 01:44.332
So this past that never really
existed for you,

01:44.348 --> 01:46.325
that you're angry about,

01:46.344 --> 01:48.329
ends up having this whole weight
attached to it.

01:48.349 --> 01:52.366
Like if you knew what it was, then
it would tell you who you are.

01:56.331 --> 01:59.344
Kat, hey! Spare seat if you want.

01:59.361 --> 02:01.389
Er...

02:01.409 --> 02:05.379
Stupid me, I forgot my pointe shoes
back in the studio.

02:05.398 --> 02:08.342
Um... they're hanging
out of your bag.

02:11.344 --> 02:12.397
Stay. Seriously.

02:12.412 --> 02:14.389
I'm taking the zen approach.

02:14.405 --> 02:16.338
What happened is in the past.

02:16.357 --> 02:18.342
If you guys wanna be together,
be together.

02:18.358 --> 02:20.394
I'm still a cheerleader for love.

02:21.399 --> 02:23.343
OK, I'm gonna go.

02:24.424 --> 02:27.369
Um... yeah, me too.

02:33.422 --> 02:37.335
Christian! Maybe you want to talk
to me about your dance piece.

02:37.352 --> 02:38.404
Yeah, why?

02:38.424 --> 02:41.393
Miss Raine mentioned you haven't
always had the easiest time of it.

02:41.413 --> 02:44.370
You guys must be light on
for conversation, then.

02:45.394 --> 02:47.375
I'm getting a sense
you're not into this assignment.

02:48.379 --> 02:49.424
No, I want to thank you

02:50.343 --> 02:52.432
for letting me work through
some of my past issues.

02:53.348 --> 02:54.393
Best teacher ever.

03:00.434 --> 03:03.375
Ah, he's back!

03:03.392 --> 03:05.392
Woo hoo woo hoo!

03:08.373 --> 03:09.369
Ow!

03:09.385 --> 03:10.417
I don't believe it.

03:10.438 --> 03:13.346
You made it to the end of the tour
without getting kicked off again.

03:13.362 --> 03:14.394
Oh, only just.

03:14.415 --> 03:17.371
If the gods can understand nudity
in fountains, why can't Miss Raine?

03:17.392 --> 03:20.397
Well she is, however,
letting me compete in the Prix.

03:20.412 --> 03:23.369
How? You missed the preliminaries.

03:23.389 --> 03:26.394
Yeah, I missed doing Sydney, but the
regional rounds are still underway

03:26.414 --> 03:28.439
and since I was technically born
in the Kingston Shire...

03:29.359 --> 03:30.435
I smell a loophole.
Hmm.

03:31.352 --> 03:33.364
I just... have to get up the coast,

03:33.380 --> 03:36.373
ideally in a red car.

03:36.389 --> 03:37.442
Oh!

03:38.357 --> 03:39.158
Ohh.

03:40.451 --> 03:41.447
Hey.

03:42.363 --> 03:43.399
I'm borrowing your torch.

03:43.419 --> 03:45.439
Where are you off to?
Kingston.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.377
Regionals.

03:47.396 --> 03:49.433
Yeah.
We're roughing it.

03:49.449 --> 03:51.449
With aromatherapy.

03:52.370 --> 03:53.434
Do you want to get eaten alive
by mosquitoes?

03:53.454 --> 03:55.434
Is there any extra room
in the car?

03:56.447 --> 03:59.364
There's a guy that makes
finless boards up there.

03:59.380 --> 04:00.432
Wouldn't mind checking one out.

04:02.365 --> 04:04.397
Did anyone say road trip?

04:10.391 --> 04:15.413
♪ And it's telling me that
this world's just so deep and wide ♪

04:15.429 --> 04:18.401
♪ Yeah, it's when I come alive ♪

04:18.418 --> 04:22.395
♪ Out on a long drive. ♪

04:25.392 --> 04:29.377
Yeah, they pull out this assignment
every year, and nothing is original.

04:29.392 --> 04:31.369
Two other guys aside from me

04:31.389 --> 04:33.370
did the whole coming out
to Mum and Dad number

04:33.390 --> 04:35.406
and worse still, one of them went
through a cross-dressing stage

04:35.427 --> 04:38.411
so he danced both the part
of Clara and the Prince

04:38.428 --> 04:40.408
and got the highest mark.

04:40.424 --> 04:41.456
I was ropable.

04:42.377 --> 04:44.421
How did your parents take it
when you came out?

04:44.437 --> 04:46.382
That's probably a bit too personal.

04:46.397 --> 04:47.466
No, it's cool, it's cool.

04:48.386 --> 04:50.439
I just always knew.
I guess they did too.

04:50.459 --> 04:53.411
That's why I was annoyed at myself
for using it in the assignment.

04:53.432 --> 04:55.469
Like, since when had being gay
defined me?

05:01.418 --> 05:03.475
It just says to record
a narration of our story

05:04.391 --> 05:05.432
and then just put it to music.

05:05.447 --> 05:08.416
OK, I'm 12 years old.

05:08.432 --> 05:10.429
It hasn't rained in months.

05:10.445 --> 05:13.478
Suddenly, there's a sun shower.

05:14.394 --> 05:16.451
I'm dancing inside of a rainbow.

05:16.470 --> 05:21.440
No... I think they mean powerful,
life-defining moments.

05:21.456 --> 05:24.421
Like the rage I felt

05:24.441 --> 05:26.469
when I was blackmailed
to leave the Royal Ballet.

05:27.386 --> 05:28.418
I didn't know that happened.

05:28.434 --> 05:30.387
Or the desperation...

05:30.407 --> 05:32.440
when I tried to save the kids
next door from drowning.

05:33.444 --> 05:36.477
Or the fury when I was arrested
at the G20 Summit protest.

05:37.396 --> 05:39.477
You were arrested?
Oh, yeah, no, no. I get that.

05:40.398 --> 05:43.446
It's exactly how I felt during
round 23 of the 2001 season.

05:43.463 --> 05:45.447
Rage, desperation, fury!

05:45.467 --> 05:48.408
But then the triumph
in the 64th minute

05:48.424 --> 05:50.400
with that wide pass from Peadon.

05:56.403 --> 05:58.399
Why do you do that?

05:58.415 --> 05:59.399
What?

05:59.419 --> 06:02.400
Show people that one-sided version
of yourself.

06:02.416 --> 06:04.453
I don't know what you're on about.

06:04.469 --> 06:06.473
I think you do, Ben.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.435
Mate, come a bit closer.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.464
Ollie's tent's looking like
a good option.

06:15.484 --> 06:18.489
Nah. We're more in touch
with the elements out here.

06:20.437 --> 06:21.486
Alright, we're done.

06:22.406 --> 06:23.467
Let's go check out
that surfboard guy.

06:23.486 --> 06:26.487
Ah, I was thinking I was just going
to head down to the beach instead.

06:27.408 --> 06:30.404
The beach? But then you would have
come out here for nothing.

06:30.425 --> 06:32.493
Well, don't you have that class
section in the afternoon?

06:33.409 --> 06:34.462
Yeah, but... we'll be back in time.

06:37.486 --> 06:39.451
What about putting in some training?

06:51.471 --> 06:53.427
What is it you think you know?

06:54.504 --> 06:57.429
Um, at the hospital,

06:57.448 --> 06:59.481
one of the nurses said
that you were her patient.

06:59.497 --> 07:02.510
That'd be Meg. Loves a chat.

07:04.422 --> 07:05.479
Can I ask?

07:05.495 --> 07:07.452
I was five.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.468
I didn't know what leukaemia meant.

07:09.488 --> 07:13.441
Seven years worth of treatment
later, I went into remission.

07:13.457 --> 07:15.449
That's when I started dancing.

07:15.470 --> 07:18.426
Must be so exhausting,
having to keep a secret like that.

07:18.443 --> 07:20.423
People just...

07:21.427 --> 07:22.512
They get weird when they know.

07:23.432 --> 07:26.449
I don't think Grace would be weird.
She's been through a lot as well.

07:26.469 --> 07:29.454
What, like the drowning of children,
and riots?

07:31.458 --> 07:34.507
Tell me you've convinced her
to go less flowery.

07:35.428 --> 07:38.457
Actually, I'm thinking
about changing my solo.

07:38.476 --> 07:40.497
Basing it on being
a cancer survivor.

07:40.513 --> 07:42.445
Cancer?

07:43.450 --> 07:45.434
Why didn't I think of that?

07:49.472 --> 07:51.456
You know,
I could make it wider for you.

07:51.476 --> 07:55.474
It would add a bit more buoyancy.
Just depends what you want.

07:55.494 --> 07:58.454
I could probably take a little bit
off this for you,

07:58.470 --> 08:00.495
given your sizing and your weight.

08:00.515 --> 08:04.468
I mean, you know, you can have any
choice of tail, whatever you like.

08:04.488 --> 08:08.470
But I'd probably like to have a few
speed channels through here as well,

08:08.489 --> 08:12.503
and then give it a nice design,
good spray job and ah, you know?

08:12.518 --> 08:14.439
Alright?

08:14.455 --> 08:15.488
Just excuse me for a sec.

08:15.503 --> 08:18.465
OK. Um, I'm done, so let's go.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.525
Can I help you, fellas?

08:21.457 --> 08:24.490
Yeah, um, I was thinking of getting
one of those Alaias made.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.479
Oh, right.
You ah, know much about 'em?

08:28.483 --> 08:31.492
They're supposed to give you
more freedom in how you turn?

08:33.441 --> 08:35.442
Yeah, well I custom-build
all my own boards,

08:35.461 --> 08:37.498
so ah, if you want
to meet me down the beach

08:37.517 --> 08:39.539
we can go for a surf
and see which one suits.

08:40.455 --> 08:42.443
Yeah, sure. Alright.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.488
Say... what, about an hour?

08:45.520 --> 08:47.473
What's your name?

08:48.497 --> 08:50.446
Chris.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.455
Alright, Chris. See you then.

08:59.452 --> 09:00.512
So Chris...

09:00.529 --> 09:02.517
What was that about?

09:02.538 --> 09:06.455
Been stuck in the car too long.
Feel like a run?

09:06.470 --> 09:07.503
Not really.

09:15.477 --> 09:17.506
Imprisoned
in the leukaemia ward,

09:17.525 --> 09:21.479
I'm a red blood cell, staring down
at a team of white.

09:22.483 --> 09:23.543
They are advancing,

09:24.460 --> 09:26.520
and I try to stay defiant,

09:26.540 --> 09:29.553
but I can't help but feel
there is no hope in sight.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.550
I am red,

09:32.466 --> 09:33.502
one,

09:33.519 --> 09:34.502
white,

09:34.519 --> 09:35.547
many.

09:36.515 --> 09:38.536
I am losing the fight.

09:42.517 --> 09:44.542
Oh, it's... It's powerful.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.471
Grace?
It's a little earnest.

09:49.487 --> 09:52.496
No, no, it's poignant and honest.

10:01.562 --> 10:03.527
What did you think of him?

10:05.476 --> 10:06.556
Who?

10:07.473 --> 10:08.509
The guy in the shop.

10:10.518 --> 10:11.561
He's my father.

10:13.506 --> 10:14.542
What?

10:14.559 --> 10:17.483
As in your father father?

10:18.487 --> 10:20.492
As in biologically, yeah.

10:20.509 --> 10:22.509
Are you gonna tell him who you are?

10:24.529 --> 10:26.530
Wait, I don't understand.
How do you know?

10:26.546 --> 10:29.479
I knew he was here.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.540
It was as good a time as any.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.509
That's a fairly life-defining
moment, Christian.

10:36.525 --> 10:37.569
Ready to go?

11:13.544 --> 11:15.581
Thank you.
That completes the class section.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.545
We look forward to seeing you all
tomorrow for your solos.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.545
You need to relax. Alright?
Just a bit of this.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.494
Don't!

11:34.538 --> 11:36.531
You know, I never thought
you'd be one of those.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.548
One of what?

12:05.516 --> 12:06.563
So where do you surf?

12:06.580 --> 12:08.568
Maroubra, mostly.

12:08.588 --> 12:10.577
I'll probably get you
a longer board, then.

12:10.593 --> 12:12.525
Stop you sliding.

12:48.548 --> 12:50.593
And battling
the flames, I found the babe,

12:50.613 --> 12:53.525
clutched her to me
and said a prayer,

12:53.545 --> 12:55.614
earned the respect
of the spunky fire brigade

12:56.534 --> 12:59.579
and ran into the safety
of the cool night air.

13:01.584 --> 13:05.589
My piece is going to demolish
Ben's wimpy blood cells.

13:05.605 --> 13:07.606
I think I'm having a dance high.

13:10.614 --> 13:13.567
It's just... one minute
your piece is about

13:13.588 --> 13:15.563
saving the kids next door
from drowning

13:15.584 --> 13:17.621
and the next it's about a house fire
and a baby.

13:18.537 --> 13:19.601
Visually stronger.

13:19.621 --> 13:23.598
People are supposed to be
opening up about what defines them.

13:23.618 --> 13:25.618
And that defines you,
does it, petal?

13:26.535 --> 13:27.592
Yeah.

13:27.612 --> 13:30.529
You might have been
the girl in the paddock,

13:30.544 --> 13:31.580
but she's gone.

13:31.601 --> 13:34.577
You haven't been her
since you broke your back.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.610
And you're not OK
with Kat and Christian.

13:36.626 --> 13:38.587
You're still angry.

13:38.607 --> 13:41.584
If I had to choose between
a bit of harmless fabrication

13:41.603 --> 13:44.601
and lying to myself,
I know which one I'd go for.

13:51.587 --> 13:53.595
So what got you into finless?

13:53.615 --> 13:56.588
Oh, that's what the Hawaiians
used to ride.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.601
Hawaii.

13:58.621 --> 14:01.630
See, I'd love to get over there.
Take some time out.

14:02.546 --> 14:03.618
Get away from everybody.

14:05.543 --> 14:07.595
Sounds like girl problems.

14:07.611 --> 14:10.592
Yeah.

14:11.612 --> 14:15.589
No, she's cool. It's just...
the situation is complicated.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.555
Yeah. It's always complicated.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.568
Well, you're too young
to be tied down anyway.

14:25.556 --> 14:27.565
Was that your problem?

14:27.581 --> 14:28.610
Sorry?

14:28.629 --> 14:32.575
You were too young to be tied down
to a wife and kids.

14:32.591 --> 14:34.567
Is that why you left?

14:38.597 --> 14:40.557
Christian.

14:40.577 --> 14:42.614
I knew who you were
when you walked in.

14:44.587 --> 14:46.627
I don't know what you want me
to say, I mean...

14:48.564 --> 14:49.643
you just showed up.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.585
You don't have to say anything.

15:01.571 --> 15:03.564
He's living the good life.

15:03.584 --> 15:06.629
How messed up is that after
everything she went through?

15:06.644 --> 15:08.629
I mean, she never got over him.

15:08.649 --> 15:11.598
Right up until the end,
and he never looked back.

15:13.583 --> 15:16.632
Alright, er, Ollie's tent
is looking like a good option.

15:19.592 --> 15:21.645
Do you like him or something?

15:22.565 --> 15:24.598
Because you're avoiding him...
No!

15:24.614 --> 15:27.591
No! He lied!

15:27.607 --> 15:29.575
By omission.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.632
OK? He should have mentioned it.
That's mentionable.

15:31.652 --> 15:35.597
Uh-huh. 'Cause you said you were
gonna be working that stuff out.

15:35.613 --> 15:37.597
Working out what stuff?

15:38.654 --> 15:41.627
Excuse me, we're trying to have
a personal conversation here.

15:43.628 --> 15:46.632
Oi! Both of you,
get in here before you drown.

15:48.645 --> 15:51.606
Don't worry. I'm not into
the neurotic type.

16:29.669 --> 16:31.605
Ben!

16:31.622 --> 16:32.654
Ben! Ben!

16:32.670 --> 16:35.635
Ben! Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!

16:35.655 --> 16:38.636
Remember
my cheerleading tryouts?

16:38.651 --> 16:40.628
Yeah, in detail.

16:40.649 --> 16:43.585
You skipped your doctor's appointment
that day.

16:43.601 --> 16:44.678
Was that... Was that to...

16:49.651 --> 16:52.680
Biopics about cancer and genocide
always get the Academy Awards.

16:54.624 --> 16:56.597
You'll get fantastic marks.

17:04.604 --> 17:05.655
That is what I've been trying
to avoid!

17:05.672 --> 17:07.612
What?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.613
That!

17:09.633 --> 17:11.633
It's what I've enjoyed
about being here this year!

17:11.650 --> 17:13.607
I'm not 'Cancer Boy'.

17:13.626 --> 17:16.618
What's wrong with digging deeper?
I don't want to dig deeper.

17:16.638 --> 17:20.599
Because if I do, I have to remember
the look on my dad's face

17:20.616 --> 17:21.667
when we wait for my results.

17:21.689 --> 17:25.641
And I have to remember
when someone died in my ward

17:25.657 --> 17:27.682
and no-one would speak for ages.

17:29.627 --> 17:30.671
I'm sorry.
No!

17:30.691 --> 17:32.676
I don't want you to feel sorry
for me.

17:32.696 --> 17:35.689
I've spent half my life
making everyone miserable.

17:36.605 --> 17:38.605
It's not who I am anymore.

17:45.603 --> 17:46.664
You're throwing your weight back.

17:46.684 --> 17:48.640
What have I told you
about your landing?

17:48.660 --> 17:50.701
You can't instruct me
from up there.

17:51.621 --> 17:53.641
Well, I wouldn't want to invade
your personal space.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.681
I stuffed it yesterday. I'm not
gonna make it to Nationals.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.654
Mate, you gotta use your plie.
Then you'll be fine.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.626
Watch.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.616
You know, it used to blow me away
to watch your mum dance.

18:29.636 --> 18:32.617
Same.
Trish must be so proud.

18:34.630 --> 18:35.675
She died.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.639
18 months ago.

18:40.716 --> 18:42.661
She was sick.

18:42.676 --> 18:44.665
I looked after her.

18:45.698 --> 18:48.642
Did you ever even love her?

18:48.662 --> 18:51.683
More than I've ever been capable
of loving anyone.

18:51.699 --> 18:53.631
But you left.

18:53.652 --> 18:57.640
How can you love someone and then
just do that to them?

18:58.661 --> 19:00.670
I know it's not an excuse but...

19:01.706 --> 19:03.718
I was 19 years old
when I married your mum.

19:04.639 --> 19:07.635
I wasn't equipped
to handle any of it.

19:07.652 --> 19:08.700
I had to work out who I was.

19:08.716 --> 19:10.676
Well, did you figure it out?

19:10.697 --> 19:13.685
Because she needed you
and you weren't there.

19:17.639 --> 19:18.707
We all did.

19:20.707 --> 19:23.652
Look, I just watched you dance
just now,

19:23.669 --> 19:25.693
and you were amazing.

19:25.709 --> 19:28.662
You think you needed me, but...

19:28.682 --> 19:32.667
look what you became
without me.

20:23.682 --> 20:24.726
Thanks, man.

20:28.656 --> 20:30.668
I kind of lied before.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.661
I do like the neurotic ones.

20:50.690 --> 20:53.687
So I guess when it comes down to it,

20:53.703 --> 20:55.720
I want my future to define me.

20:55.736 --> 20:57.741
Not my past.

21:02.754 --> 21:04.698
That's it.

21:05.706 --> 21:06.751
Hey, fellas.

21:09.672 --> 21:10.752
I found this in the back
of the shed.

21:11.672 --> 21:14.693
Might slide a little bit
but it should be alright.

21:16.702 --> 21:17.750
Look, I don't have the money.

21:35.676 --> 21:36.756
I wonder who I'd be

21:37.676 --> 21:39.688
if the people I needed
had stuck around.

21:39.709 --> 21:43.706
Who I'd be without all those things
that have tested me...

21:57.726 --> 22:00.699
more than I'll ever be tested
in my life.

22:03.687 --> 22:06.681
Without the one whose heart
I broke...

22:25.746 --> 22:28.711
or the one who makes me forget
about the dark stuff.

22:28.727 --> 22:31.740
Hi. Look, don't worry about me. OK?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.753
We can just ignore the fact
that Tara's given us permission.

22:34.769 --> 22:36.762
Because she lights up everything.

22:36.777 --> 22:38.758
Even if there was a moment,

22:38.778 --> 22:41.778
we've probably missed it now anyway,
so there's really no point in...

22:55.727 --> 22:57.704
Good to have you back, gentlemen.

23:06.702 --> 23:08.791
Someone I wouldn't mind introducing
to the rest of my life.

23:12.772 --> 23:14.753
Call me Christian Reed.
