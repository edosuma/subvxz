01:58.524 --> 02:01.692
I mean, last night, I had a
dream where I was swimming with

02:01.694 --> 02:06.464
Joey Fatone of 'N Sync, and then he turned
into a corn dog and my teeth fell out.

02:06.466 --> 02:08.065
How am I supposed
to achieve that?

02:08.067 --> 02:10.300
- Your dreams are useless.
- I know it.

02:10.303 --> 02:12.403
Shake, how many times
do I have to tell you?

02:12.405 --> 02:14.538
It fluctuates but at least 10!

02:14.540 --> 02:19.443

that slot and I can headline?

08:09.286 --> 08:10.585
Just hit me back.

08:10.587 --> 08:11.686
You have my digits.

08:11.688 --> 08:14.256
Shake, he isn't picking up, man.

08:14.758 --> 08:18.923
I just got a text from him...
"Lick my feet."

08:18.929 --> 08:20.695
Oh, hilarious!

08:20.697 --> 08:23.427
He's being ironic. We need
to get to that show.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.467
Oh, he says he left
me some tickets.

08:25.469 --> 08:29.337
I just got to pick them
up at ticketmaster.com.

08:29.339 --> 08:31.573
You want me to see if
I can squeeze you in?

08:31.575 --> 08:33.607
♪ Chicken and beans ♪

08:33.610 --> 08:35.409
♪ Chicken and beans ♪

08:35.412 --> 08:38.246
You know what?

08:38.248 --> 08:39.514
Screw "chicken and beans."

08:39.515 --> 08:40.515
I'm done with that.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.816
I ain't no dancing robot.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.852
I'm an artist, and
I need to create.

08:43.854 --> 08:47.422
You're just beasts and animals,
shakin' the bars and the cages

08:47.424 --> 08:50.358
in my zoo, and I'm a magic
unicorn astride a golden

08:50.360 --> 08:53.562
stallion, picked up by two
giant bronze grizzly bears.

08:53.564 --> 08:56.898
Charity, Chastity, blow
me before I go onstage.

08:56.900 --> 09:02.466
I got to lose 3 ounces so I can rock
these leather chaps right proper.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.374
Hey, who knows that song?

09:06.376 --> 09:08.209
Put your hands
together, Hollywood.

09:08.211 --> 09:09.377
Come on, yeah!

09:09.379 --> 09:10.378
I'm his best friend.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.780
Yeah, there you go.

09:11.782 --> 09:14.149
Little "chicken and beans" up in here?

09:14.151 --> 09:15.817
Yeah!

09:15.819 --> 09:17.152
You want to hear a little

09:17.154 --> 09:18.920
"Chicken and beans"
up in here, huh?

09:20.223 --> 09:22.757
Then go down to the record
store and buy my record!

09:22.759 --> 09:25.860
Stop stealing my [bleep].

09:25.862 --> 09:26.928
Yeah, that's right.

09:26.930 --> 09:27.896
I said it.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.464
Throw up! Throw up!

09:29.466 --> 09:31.333
Shut up! Shut up!

09:31.335 --> 09:33.735
You ain't worth an
ounce of my puke.

09:33.737 --> 09:35.704
I puke for friends,
and you ain't that.

09:35.706 --> 09:36.571
I'm done.

09:36.573 --> 09:37.272
"F" y'all.

09:38.508 --> 09:39.608
Let me by!

09:39.610 --> 09:42.344
I've got a crowd pleaser!

09:42.346 --> 09:42.944
♪ Bruschet...

09:42.946 --> 09:44.679
Wait, no!

09:44.681 --> 09:47.348
Uh, excuse me.
Coming through, here. Meatwad!

09:47.354 --> 09:48.687
French Fry.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.155
Did you see my whores over here?

09:50.157 --> 09:52.090
They got my briefcase
full of pills.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.258
'Cause, uh, I got a medical

09:53.260 --> 09:54.993
condition comin' on...
It's called genius.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.138
You're grounded.

09:56.140 --> 09:58.007
Yeah, that's right.
I said it.

09:58.009 --> 10:00.609
How 'bout you fax that
offer to my publicist?

10:00.611 --> 10:03.875
And we'll flush it down the toilet in
front of you and see if it floats.

10:03.881 --> 10:06.248
No. I don't believe
you heard me.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.684
- I said you're grounded.
- You're bluffing me, French Fry.

10:08.686 --> 10:12.054
Oh, yeah? Try me.

10:12.056 --> 10:13.722
Please don't ground me.

10:13.724 --> 10:14.723
Six weeks.

10:14.725 --> 10:15.891
Aw, man.

10:15.893 --> 10:17.660
Can you believe this?

10:17.662 --> 10:21.063
I'm being sued by five Aryan
Arachnids for infringing upon

10:21.065 --> 10:24.496
the copyright of "Big City Nights,"
note for note.

10:24.502 --> 10:25.901
Have you ever even
heard that song?

10:25.903 --> 10:27.670
Only 'cause you play
it all the time.

10:27.672 --> 10:29.738
I know. It's incredible.

10:29.740 --> 10:32.675
And I changed it <i>just</i>
enough to make it mine.

10:32.677 --> 10:34.777
This is America. We
do what we want!

10:34.779 --> 10:36.979
Hey, can I come out of
the quiet corner yet?

10:36.981 --> 10:38.113
Yeah, I guess so.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.082
We have to take this
jackass to court.

10:40.084 --> 10:41.684
Oh, you're not wearing that.

10:41.686 --> 10:42.851
Forks, yes!

10:42.853 --> 10:46.855
We'll see who has the last
sting in court, scorpions.
