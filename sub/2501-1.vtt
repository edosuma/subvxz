00:55.350 --> 00:57.960
<i>My name is Anthony Powell.</i>

00:58.438 --> 01:01.906
<i>I grew up on this dairy farm
in Taranaki, New Zealand.</i>

01:01.908 --> 01:03.575
<i>But I've actually spent most</i>

01:03.577 --> 01:07.745
<i>of my adult life living
and working in Antarctica.</i>

01:07.747 --> 01:10.415
<i>The most common question
I get asked is</i>

01:10.417 --> 01:12.650
<i>"What's it like to live
down there?"</i>

01:13.686 --> 01:16.287
<i>It's so hard to answer
that in words</i>

01:16.289 --> 01:19.457
<i>and it's never really been
captured on film before.</i>

01:20.459 --> 01:23.628
<i>But there's something about
time lapse photography</i>

01:23.630 --> 01:27.565
<i>that brings to life
the dynamic forces of nature</i>

01:27.567 --> 01:29.968
<i>that you can feel
and sense around you,</i>

01:29.970 --> 01:32.437
<i>but you can't actually see.</i>

01:33.806 --> 01:37.575
<i>So I've taught myself how
to use a variety of cameras</i>

01:37.577 --> 01:40.778
<i>and built some homemade
equipment in my spare time</i>

01:40.780 --> 01:43.781
<i>that can still function
in the extreme cold.</i>

02:27.327 --> 02:31.597
<i>It's taken me more than
10 years to make this film.</i>

02:31.599 --> 02:33.432
<i>I've worn out
thousands of dollars</i>

02:33.434 --> 02:34.867
<i>worth of camera gear...</i>

02:36.503 --> 02:39.972
<i>and spent countless hours
standing in the freezing cold</i>

02:39.974 --> 02:43.976
<i>in an effort to capture
the true feeling of this vast</i>

02:43.978 --> 02:45.344
<i>important place.</i>

02:49.716 --> 02:53.018
<i>There really are only
two seasons in Antarctica:</i>

02:53.020 --> 02:56.088
<i>a busy summer when most
of the science happens...</i>

02:59.025 --> 03:01.026
<i>and a wild and lonely winter</i>

03:01.028 --> 03:03.462
<i>that few people will
ever experience.</i>

03:09.636 --> 03:11.804
<i>To understand the place properly</i>

03:11.806 --> 03:14.573
<i>you really need to spend
one full year</i>

03:14.575 --> 03:16.642
<i>down here on the ice.</i>

05:06.955 --> 05:08.789
<i>I think that most people</i>

05:08.791 --> 05:11.158
<i>think that we're all scientists.</i>

05:11.160 --> 05:14.061
<i>There are real people
down here.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:16.597
<i>It's not just
the people you see</i>

05:16.599 --> 05:18.566
<i>on the National Geographic
channels</i>

05:18.568 --> 05:21.535
<i>or it's not people
who can afford</i>

05:21.537 --> 05:23.604
<i>a $10.000 cruise.</i>

05:25.574 --> 05:28.142
<i>It's people who are just
like you and me</i>

05:28.144 --> 05:30.878
<i>who are average citizens</i>

05:30.946 --> 05:32.947
<i>who are working and doing a job</i>

06:26.668 --> 06:28.168
<i>That first breath...</i>

06:28.170 --> 06:30.070
<i>it's like a sledgehammer
to the face.</i>

06:30.972 --> 06:32.740
<i>It's your wake up call.</i>

06:32.742 --> 06:33.974
<i>It's okay, you're here now.</i>

06:33.976 --> 06:35.743
<i>This is the real deal.</i>

06:45.855 --> 06:47.221
<i>I couldn't believe
I was actually doing it.</i>

06:47.223 --> 06:48.222
<i>I was actually here.</i>

06:48.224 --> 06:49.657
<i>I was in Antarctica...</i>

06:49.659 --> 06:50.891
<i>the bottom of the planet.</i>

06:50.893 --> 06:52.826
<i>And then my second thought was</i>

06:52.828 --> 06:55.930
"Oh crap,
what have I just done?"

06:55.932 --> 06:57.197
Why am I here?

07:09.946 --> 07:11.713
<i>I saw Erebus</i>

07:11.715 --> 07:13.782
<i>and wanted to go
hiking there</i>

07:13.784 --> 07:14.783
<i>and snowboard down it</i>

07:14.785 --> 07:16.251
and I was quickly told "No"

07:16.253 --> 07:18.219
and then I was off to work.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.898
<i>We had been thinking
oh we're going to Antarctica</i>

07:29.900 --> 07:32.767
<i>and when you get here it's like,
oh yeah I've gotta work</i>

07:32.769 --> 07:35.070
<i>And you don't put that
into your head your first time</i>

07:35.072 --> 07:37.606
<i>you're so excited
about coming down</i>

07:37.608 --> 07:40.775
that you forget that you're
coming down here for a reason.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.380
<i>They hurried us off the plane</i>

07:45.382 --> 07:47.349
<i>so we couldn't take
a look around</i>

07:47.351 --> 07:49.684
<i>and pretty much
it was just here</i>

07:49.686 --> 07:51.786
<i>and the next thing we knew
we were in town.</i>

07:54.157 --> 07:57.125
<i>So the first thing we really saw
of Antarctica was McMurdo</i>

07:57.127 --> 07:59.327
and that's always kind of
disappointing sometimes.

08:15.111 --> 08:16.911
<i>It's a pretty small,
tight community</i>

08:16.979 --> 08:19.214
<i>People pull together
and get things done.</i>

08:19.216 --> 08:23.018
<i>Pretty amazing what gets done
for what little we have.</i>

08:23.020 --> 08:25.687
I've seen a lot of different
personalities come down here.

08:25.689 --> 08:28.857
The ones that seem to do
the most of it are

08:28.859 --> 08:32.027
the die-hards or
the more grounded people.

08:37.732 --> 08:41.803
<i>McMurdo Station sits
beside the sea on Ross Island.</i>

08:41.804 --> 08:44.072
<i>It's dwarfed by Mt. Erebus</i>

08:44.073 --> 08:48.009
<i>the southernmost
active volcano in the world.</i>

08:48.011 --> 08:51.346
<i>Three kilometers away on
the other side of the peninsula</i>

08:51.348 --> 08:53.348
<i>is the small New Zealand outpost</i>

08:53.350 --> 08:55.383
<i>Scott Base.</i>

08:57.420 --> 09:00.055
<i>Scott Base is a lot
more typical in size</i>

09:00.057 --> 09:03.259
<i>of the other bases
dotted around Antarctica.</i>

09:06.063 --> 09:08.964
<i>And its proximity
to McMurdo is unusual.</i>

09:15.205 --> 09:18.140
<i>There are only
30 permanently manned bases</i>

09:18.142 --> 09:21.010
<i>on the entire continent
and most of these</i>

09:21.012 --> 09:24.146
<i>have less than 20 people
living in them in the winter.</i>

09:29.886 --> 09:33.256
<i>At Scott Base you have to
live and work in one building.</i>

09:33.258 --> 09:36.326
<i>Our accommodation
is a very small room</i>

09:36.328 --> 09:38.395
<i>It's like a cell,
if you like,</i>

09:38.397 --> 09:40.230
<i>or a cupboard.</i>

09:46.104 --> 09:50.440
<i>A lot of things here
can get to you pretty quickly</i>

09:50.442 --> 09:52.075
<i>especially in winter.</i>

09:54.112 --> 09:56.113
<i>And you cannot change them.</i>

09:57.281 --> 10:00.016
You cannot argue much
about them either

10:00.018 --> 10:03.053
because this person
will be in front of your eyes,

10:03.055 --> 10:05.088
you know, on the next Smoko.

10:05.890 --> 10:09.392
<i>So to be tolerant
is very important.</i>

10:16.168 --> 10:17.434
<i>When people ask me why</i>

10:17.436 --> 10:22.839
to come back because this
is the second time

10:22.841 --> 10:24.174
I've arrived in Antarctica.

10:24.176 --> 10:25.876
<i>For me it's those
white mountains.</i>

10:27.044 --> 10:29.045
<i>Those white mountains</i>

10:29.047 --> 10:30.380
<i>and you look across
and you know</i>

10:30.382 --> 10:32.783
<i>just because
humanity had trouble</i>

10:32.785 --> 10:35.886
<i>getting here in the first place
we're relatively new arrivals.</i>

10:35.888 --> 10:39.055
<i>We have not had the opportunity
to mess it up very much yet.</i>

10:45.497 --> 10:48.532
We have nations getting along
better in Antarctica

10:48.534 --> 10:51.535
than I think they're doing
anywhere else in the world.

10:51.537 --> 10:53.537
It's worth something
to keep it this way

10:53.539 --> 10:56.339
<i>if we can do whatever we can
to keep the co-operations</i>

10:56.341 --> 10:58.074
<i>and just the pure pursuit
of things</i>

10:58.076 --> 10:59.843
<i>that make us
better as humans.</i>

11:01.145 --> 11:02.345
<i>That's happening right now</i>

11:02.347 --> 11:04.815
<i>on this continent,
and it's special.</i>

11:12.123 --> 11:14.224
<i>I could live indefinitely here</i>

11:14.226 --> 11:16.092
if I could, on occasion,

11:17.829 --> 11:18.895
get out.

11:18.897 --> 11:19.896
Like I haven't...

11:19.898 --> 11:22.032
I've literally gone nowhere

11:22.034 --> 11:23.400
since August.

11:24.936 --> 11:26.436
<i>Most people that have
been here that long</i>

11:26.438 --> 11:28.438
<i>at least have gone to maybe</i>

11:28.440 --> 11:30.106
<i>the Pole or something...</i>

11:30.875 --> 11:32.409
<i>or at least gotten out of town.</i>

11:38.916 --> 11:41.084
<i>You will get to see
some fun stuff</i>

11:41.086 --> 11:44.554
<i>but the main thing you're
down here for is to work.</i>

11:44.556 --> 11:46.857
<i>And I hate to sound cold</i>

11:46.859 --> 11:47.891
<i>when it comes to that,</i>

11:47.893 --> 11:49.593
<i>but I think a lot of people
lose that focus</i>

11:49.595 --> 11:51.094
and when they come down here

11:51.096 --> 11:53.196
and all they get to see
is a dish room

11:53.198 --> 11:56.466
or get to stare at
a computer the whole time

11:56.468 --> 11:57.934
I think they might be
a little disillusioned.

12:08.947 --> 12:11.582
<i>I came down with
the Italians originally.</i>

12:12.384 --> 12:14.352
But having done it once

12:14.354 --> 12:17.054
you know I sort of thought
well that'll do.

12:17.056 --> 12:18.055
But a couple of years later

12:18.057 --> 12:18.956
I was back again.

12:20.592 --> 12:21.626
<i>Still here.</i>

12:24.263 --> 12:27.632
<i>Rob has been flying
in Antarctica for 20 years,</i>

12:27.634 --> 12:29.467
<i>but he's never done
a winter here.</i>

12:29.469 --> 12:31.903
<i>Helicopters only fly
in the summer.</i>

12:38.277 --> 12:41.279
<i>It's probably safer flying here
than in New Zealand</i>

12:41.281 --> 12:44.482
<i>because you never have
to contend with the weather.</i>

12:44.484 --> 12:47.351
<i>At home there's various
degrees of weather.</i>

12:47.353 --> 12:49.287
Here it's either good
or it's not.

12:49.289 --> 12:51.555
Whereas home,
it might be okay

12:51.557 --> 12:53.057
or just okay

12:53.059 --> 12:54.458
or I think I can make it.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.060
But there's none of that here.

13:04.369 --> 13:08.472
<i>So, what would be
your favorite place to fly to?</i>

13:09.174 --> 13:10.508
Christchurch.

13:14.047 --> 13:15.613
No, I like the Dry Valleys.

13:15.615 --> 13:18.716
I like the Upper Wright
and the Beacon Valley as well.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.952
It's spectacular scenery,
it really is.

13:27.293 --> 13:30.227
Like Rob, I'm one
of the lucky ones.

13:30.229 --> 13:32.129
<i>The work I do in Antarctica</i>

13:32.131 --> 13:34.165
<i>allows me to get out
and experience</i>

13:34.167 --> 13:36.600
<i>some of the grandeur
and vast emptiness</i>

13:36.602 --> 13:38.502
<i>of this amazing continent.</i>

14:09.534 --> 14:12.403
<i>Wherever there is research
happening in the field</i>

14:12.405 --> 14:14.538
<i>they need their
communications support.</i>

14:14.540 --> 14:16.307
<i>So I spend a lot of time</i>

14:16.309 --> 14:18.075
<i>setting up radio equipment</i>

14:18.077 --> 14:19.610
<i>in remote locations.</i>

14:31.358 --> 14:34.127
<i>When I first came down
here in 1998,</i>

14:34.129 --> 14:38.564
<i>I was struck by how
pure and untouched it was.</i>

14:38.566 --> 14:40.466
<i>There's still places here</i>

14:40.468 --> 14:43.136
<i>where no human
has ever set foot.</i>

15:30.317 --> 15:33.086
<i>I just love
that there's still places</i>

15:33.088 --> 15:37.156
<i>in the world you can go
to experience absolute silence.</i>

15:37.424 --> 15:40.126
When you're out here
and there's no wind

15:40.128 --> 15:42.762
your ears are just
straining to hear something...

15:42.764 --> 15:44.330
anything.

15:44.332 --> 15:45.665
You just don't realize

15:45.667 --> 15:47.733
how much noise
pollution there is

15:47.735 --> 15:50.736
in your daily life
back in the real world.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.413
One very important
thing when you're...

16:00.415 --> 16:02.181
working in the deep field is...

16:02.183 --> 16:05.785
to make sure never
to confuse your pee bottle

16:05.787 --> 16:07.587
with your water bottle.

16:20.801 --> 16:22.902
Well...

16:22.904 --> 16:24.904
the summit of Erebus

16:24.906 --> 16:27.540
and an ice fumarole
that's growing

16:27.542 --> 16:31.144
from steam coming out
of one of the cracks here.

16:35.716 --> 16:37.416
<i>Most days</i>

16:37.418 --> 16:39.619
<i>I can't believe I get
to work in this place.</i>

16:45.325 --> 16:47.226
<i>But there are days when I think</i>

16:47.228 --> 16:49.262
<i>they just can't pay me enough.</i>

16:57.372 --> 17:00.507
God, this is an awful place.

17:02.377 --> 17:05.712
In theory there should be
a flag right about there.

17:09.450 --> 17:10.717
Ah yeah, there we go.

17:14.321 --> 17:16.356
Gotta love GPSs.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.498
It's the middle of summer

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
and if we check the time
it's ah...

17:26.502 --> 17:28.402
just after 12 o'clock.

17:28.404 --> 17:30.437
That's 12 o'clock
midnight though.

18:42.945 --> 18:45.012
Merry Christmas!

18:56.525 --> 18:57.791
Ah, Christmas dinner...

18:57.793 --> 19:00.627
making food
for lots and lots of people.

19:00.629 --> 19:01.728
It's a big day.

19:07.001 --> 19:09.403
We're spreading holiday cheer.

19:09.405 --> 19:12.606
<i>I think for a lot
of younger folks that come down</i>

19:12.608 --> 19:15.676
<i>it's a real good
experience for them.</i>

19:15.678 --> 19:20.047
<i>It's probably not a career
for most people,</i>

19:20.049 --> 19:22.582
but for some...
it is.

19:22.584 --> 19:25.820
I think I found it

19:25.921 --> 19:27.689
and kind of fell in love
with it.

19:48.345 --> 19:50.379
<i>I have been coming to Antarctica</i>

19:50.381 --> 19:52.715
<i>for about 13 years now.</i>

19:52.717 --> 19:54.383
<i>And when I came down
the first time</i>

19:54.385 --> 19:57.052
<i>I thought, "Ah yeah
this will be great to do once. "</i>

19:57.054 --> 19:58.454
<i>You know, just come
to Antarctica.</i>

19:58.456 --> 20:00.556
<i>And then I can say,
"Wow, I went to Antarctica. "</i>

20:00.558 --> 20:02.558
And then I signed on

20:02.560 --> 20:04.393
for a contract
the following year

20:04.395 --> 20:06.061
and then...
I don't know what happened.

20:06.063 --> 20:07.563
I'm still here.

20:17.006 --> 20:20.008
There's a saying among
the women of Antarctica

20:20.010 --> 20:22.044
<i>"The odds are good.</i>

20:22.046 --> 20:24.146
<i>But the goods, are odd. "</i>

20:28.785 --> 20:30.686
<i>Christine and I met down here</i>

20:30.688 --> 20:34.823
<i>and I proposed to her
in the winter of 2003.</i>

20:34.825 --> 20:37.760
<i>6 weeks later
we had an impromptu wedding</i>

20:37.762 --> 20:39.695
<i>down here on the ice.</i>

20:52.142 --> 20:55.711
<i>The flowers were all hand made
with folded paper.</i>

20:55.713 --> 20:57.112
<i>Christine's friend Lori</i>

20:57.114 --> 20:59.615
<i>made up a dress
from donated fabric.</i>

20:59.617 --> 21:01.950
<i>And the plumbers cut
us some rings</i>

21:01.952 --> 21:03.719
<i>made of brass.</i>

21:03.721 --> 21:06.455
<i>I borrowed the only
dinner jacket on base</i>

21:06.457 --> 21:08.490
<i>from Eric,
the station manager</i>

21:08.492 --> 21:10.692
<i>who then acted as our celebrant.</i>

21:14.063 --> 21:16.799
On this night here
on Ross Island,

21:16.801 --> 21:19.067
Christine Marie Gamble

21:19.069 --> 21:20.969
and Anthony Brendan Powell

21:20.971 --> 21:22.604
are celebrating their love

21:22.606 --> 21:24.006
and commitment
to each other.

21:24.008 --> 21:25.941
And tonight they will join

21:25.943 --> 21:27.676
as husband and wife

21:27.678 --> 21:31.213
in heart, body and soul.

21:31.215 --> 21:35.951
Hi, Dad!

21:35.953 --> 21:37.953
Just fine. Go ahead.

21:43.194 --> 21:44.493
I'm here.

21:51.502 --> 21:52.635
Thank you.

22:09.721 --> 22:12.689
<i>I've wintered over here
nine times now</i>

22:12.691 --> 22:15.058
<i>and Christine has
wintered eight times</i>

22:15.060 --> 22:16.860
<i>Living on the ice
is just something</i>

22:16.862 --> 22:19.729
<i>that's become so ingrained
in both of us.</i>

24:38.670 --> 24:40.904
<i>The TV version of penguins</i>

24:40.906 --> 24:43.040
<i>doesn't prepare you
for the reality</i>

24:43.042 --> 24:45.309
<i>of seeing an actual
penguin colony.</i>

24:47.278 --> 24:48.879
<i>There are thousands</i>

24:48.881 --> 24:51.248
<i>of frozen penguin corpses
that litter the ground.</i>

24:58.723 --> 25:02.693
<i>And in summer the sewer stench
from 100.000 penguins</i>

25:02.695 --> 25:04.396
<i>can be pretty unbearable.</i>

25:40.132 --> 25:43.368
Ten... nine... eight...

25:43.370 --> 25:47.205
Seven... Six...
Five... Four...

25:47.207 --> 25:50.308
Three... Two... One...

25:50.310 --> 25:52.911
Happy New Year, McMurdo!

26:09.161 --> 26:11.362
<i>I like this place
for a lot of reasons</i>

26:11.364 --> 26:13.398
<i>Part of me feels
like living at McMurdo</i>

26:13.400 --> 26:15.400
<i>is like living
in Never-never Land.</i>

26:16.435 --> 26:17.802
<i>There's a lot of people</i>

26:21.407 --> 26:22.841
<i>they have gone in a very</i>

26:22.843 --> 26:24.209
<i>different path in their lives.</i>

26:24.211 --> 26:26.911
<i>And sometimes one of the things
I like the best</i>

26:26.913 --> 26:27.912
<i>is being able to live a life</i>

26:27.914 --> 26:30.482
<i>with people who are
willing to take</i>

26:30.484 --> 26:31.850
<i>a slightly different path
different path in life.</i>

26:31.852 --> 26:33.151
And so for the first time
in my life

26:33.153 --> 26:36.020
I'm part of a majority because
a lot of us feel that way.

26:36.022 --> 26:38.156
And I've never been part
of the majority before.

26:46.366 --> 26:48.100
<i>We're in this...
we're in a box.</i>

26:48.102 --> 26:49.902
<i>And there's no escape
from each other.</i>

26:49.904 --> 26:51.137
<i>You can't get away.</i>

26:51.139 --> 26:54.340
<i>You're forced to interact
day in and day out.</i>

26:54.342 --> 26:57.143
<i>And you get to know people</i>

26:57.145 --> 27:00.045
very, very quickly.

27:00.047 --> 27:03.082
Whether those
relationships be good or bad

27:03.084 --> 27:05.184
they're going to be very,
very intense.

27:11.324 --> 27:13.392
That was awesome!

27:18.031 --> 27:20.199
<i>Okay, stand by
for contact again.</i>

28:29.603 --> 28:32.037
<i>McMurdo Sound is
as far south</i>

28:32.039 --> 28:35.507
<i>as it is possible to bring
a ship in the world.</i>

28:35.509 --> 28:37.509
<i>And the arrival
of the supply ship</i>

28:37.511 --> 28:40.079
<i>marks the last gasp
of summer here.</i>

29:33.100 --> 29:36.603
<i>Once the ship has been offloaded
it's immediately reloaded</i>

29:36.605 --> 29:39.572
<i>with all the rubbish,
recycling, human waste,</i>

29:39.574 --> 29:42.575
<i>and science-related cargo
from the last year.</i>

29:45.646 --> 29:47.647
<i>Nothing is left behind.</i>

29:58.025 --> 30:01.061
<i>At the end of February,
the sun starts to briefly</i>

30:01.063 --> 30:03.029
<i>dip back below the horizon.</i>

30:09.070 --> 30:11.571
<i>And those of us
who will be wintering over</i>

30:11.573 --> 30:13.273
<i>begin to seek each other out.</i>

30:22.283 --> 30:26.454
<i>But most people are
thinking about heading home.</i>

30:45.340 --> 30:47.108
<i>Have you ever been tempted</i>

30:47.110 --> 30:48.676
<i>to hang around for the winter?</i>

30:48.678 --> 30:50.111
No.

31:23.578 --> 31:26.313
<i>When the last plane leaves
that's it.</i>

31:26.315 --> 31:28.716
<i>You're stuck here
for the next 6 months.</i>

31:28.718 --> 31:30.151
<i>No way out.</i>

31:36.758 --> 31:40.428
<i>I remember thinking
what the hell did I do?</i>

31:41.364 --> 31:43.398
<i>I should be on that plane.</i>

31:43.400 --> 31:44.633
<i>No!</i>

31:57.080 --> 31:58.346
<i>God help us!</i>

32:02.185 --> 32:03.618
<i>Once it's gone,</i>

32:03.620 --> 32:05.754
<i>and the last sound of it
has disappeared,</i>

32:05.756 --> 32:08.857
<i>it's like the whole town
just breathes a huge sigh.</i>

32:10.527 --> 32:13.328
<i>Okay, here we are.</i>

32:13.330 --> 32:15.564
<i>You look around
at the people</i>

32:15.566 --> 32:18.700
<i>and you say,
"Okay, you're my friends...</i>

32:18.702 --> 32:20.735
<i>you're my family
for the next 6 months. "</i>

32:22.805 --> 32:24.739
<i>My first season
was in the winter</i>

32:24.741 --> 32:26.608
<i>and I do recall watching</i>

32:26.610 --> 32:28.477
that last plane leaving
and thinking

32:28.479 --> 32:31.113
boy I hope this is
what I want to do.

33:24.534 --> 33:25.767
<i>Attention all stations.</i>

33:25.769 --> 33:28.870
<i>Stand by for a severe
weather condition announcement.</i>

33:28.872 --> 33:31.773
<i>McMurdo weather has set
severe weather condition 2</i>

33:31.775 --> 33:34.309
<i>for the following locations</i>

33:34.311 --> 33:38.346
<i>McMurdo Station,
T - Site, Arrival Heights,</i>

33:39.482 --> 33:42.384
<i>The Road to Scott Base,</i>

33:42.386 --> 33:45.587
<i>Pegasus Field and road
to Pegasus Field.</i>

33:47.323 --> 33:50.659
<i>All other locations
remain Condition 3.</i>

33:50.661 --> 33:51.693
<i>If there's any questions</i>

33:51.695 --> 33:53.628
<i>please contact McMurdo Weather</i>

33:53.630 --> 33:56.631
<i>at extension 2523-2524.</i>

33:56.633 --> 33:59.267
<i>Some people take
the winters here very well</i>

33:59.269 --> 34:00.602
<i>and there's others
that come down</i>

34:00.604 --> 34:02.337
<i>that just don't do well
with winter.</i>

34:02.339 --> 34:04.806
<i>You know there's not enough
going on for them.</i>

34:04.808 --> 34:06.508
<i>There's not enough
social life for them.</i>

34:06.510 --> 34:10.213
It's actually, I think
a pretty definite line

34:10.215 --> 34:12.315
between winter people
and non-winter people.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.283
<i>I mean, it's usually
fairly obvious.</i>

34:24.928 --> 34:26.996
<i>One of my main jobs
during the winter</i>

34:26.998 --> 34:31.400
<i>is to maintain communications
with the outside world</i>

34:31.402 --> 34:34.303
<i>This means regular trips
out across the ice shelf</i>

34:34.304 --> 34:37.406
<i>to the satellite station
on Black Island.</i>

34:38.574 --> 34:40.243
<i>During the summer,</i>

34:40.245 --> 34:42.911
<i>it's only a 10-minute
helicopter flight away.</i>

34:42.914 --> 34:45.380
<i>But during the winter
it means getting in a vehicle,</i>

34:45.382 --> 34:48.484
<i>like a Pisten Bully
and driving there.</i>

34:48.485 --> 34:51.454
<i>When conditions are good
it's about a six-hour drive.</i>

34:51.456 --> 34:53.956
<i>But in recent years
the ice shelf has been having</i>

34:53.958 --> 34:56.292
<i>a lot of trouble
with surface melt.</i>

34:58.662 --> 35:00.963
<i>So sometimes
we've been literally</i>

35:00.965 --> 35:03.799
<i>crawling in and out of holes
taller than the vehicles</i>

35:03.801 --> 35:05.901
<i>trying to find a way
to get there.</i>

35:09.940 --> 35:11.941
Hmm, now what?

35:17.414 --> 35:19.015
Get around that

35:32.996 --> 35:35.298
<i>Hey Bill, can you see any
way through?</i>

35:53.818 --> 35:55.552
Yeah, should be all right.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.665
<i>Black Island is
one of the windiest places</i>

36:08.667 --> 36:09.800
<i>on the planet.</i>

36:09.802 --> 36:12.502
<i>It's so windy
that peak winds</i>

36:12.504 --> 36:14.004
<i>have never been
accurately measured</i>

36:14.006 --> 36:17.507
<i>because of the wind gauges
getting blown away.</i>

37:13.832 --> 37:17.568
Current wind speed
is 114 miles per hour

37:17.570 --> 37:19.137
or 99 knots...

37:19.139 --> 37:21.873
Make that 123 miles an hour.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.410
Although the camera
is on the tripod,

37:25.412 --> 37:27.845
you can see the picture
is actually quite shaky.

37:27.847 --> 37:29.046
That's because
the whole building

37:29.048 --> 37:31.048
is being shaken
by the 100-knot winds

37:31.050 --> 37:33.017
we've got at the moment.

37:33.019 --> 37:36.621
Just go for a walk out into
the main satellite dome here

37:36.623 --> 37:38.756
and show you what it looks like.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.469
As you can see,
it's a wee bit windy.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.734
I'll just show you
what it's like

38:23.736 --> 38:26.537
in the bunkhouse here
after the last storm.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.492
All the snow you can see
in the corner of the room here

38:47.494 --> 38:49.060
basically worked its way in

38:49.062 --> 38:51.629
through the tiny gaps
in the window seals.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.933
The wind speeds got up
to 222 miles an hour

38:55.935 --> 38:59.103
so this filled up in just
a matter of a few hours.

38:59.105 --> 39:01.639
And there's
a complete lounge suite

39:01.641 --> 39:02.707
in the corner over there.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.208
This is the fireplace

39:04.210 --> 39:08.280
that's normally used for
keeping the room warm.

40:13.947 --> 40:15.213
<i>In the middle of March,</i>

40:15.215 --> 40:18.016
<i>there's that magical
brief couple of weeks</i>

40:18.018 --> 40:20.018
<i>when the sun is rising
and setting</i>

40:20.020 --> 40:21.620
<i>like normal days</i>

40:21.622 --> 40:23.655
<i>and you can actually
leave the curtains open</i>

40:23.657 --> 40:25.057
<i>on your window at night</i>

40:25.059 --> 40:28.794
<i>to be woken up
by the sunrise in the morning.</i>

41:30.257 --> 41:34.028
<i>We were out
and the wind came up</i>

41:34.030 --> 41:37.064
and there was just moments
that it was so cold

41:37.066 --> 41:39.066
I could really

41:39.068 --> 41:41.402
actually feel the danger in it

41:41.404 --> 41:46.040
and feel the...
this crazy like mind thing

41:46.042 --> 41:48.042
that happened that was like...

41:48.044 --> 41:50.010
it was hard to focus
on anything

41:50.012 --> 41:54.048
except just getting out
of the conditions we were in

41:54.050 --> 41:56.817
and trying
to just be warm again.

41:57.986 --> 42:00.888
<i>It was really hard
to still focus on</i>

42:00.890 --> 42:03.390
<i>gathering all of the gear
and trying</i>

42:03.392 --> 42:05.259
<i>to do what needed to be done</i>

42:05.261 --> 42:07.261
<i>rather that just run</i>

42:07.263 --> 42:08.796
<i>for whatever vehicle</i>

42:08.798 --> 42:10.097
<i>or, you know, it was...</i>

42:10.099 --> 42:11.932
it was amazing how

42:11.934 --> 42:13.901
your instinct...
it just...

42:13.903 --> 42:15.102
it just snaps.

42:17.906 --> 42:21.375
<i>The first time where
I was just ridiculously cold</i>

42:21.377 --> 42:23.844
<i>was actually with you
just a few days ago</i>

42:23.846 --> 42:26.046
<i>taking the shift photo
up on the hill.</i>

42:26.048 --> 42:27.081
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

42:28.416 --> 42:29.483
<i>The wind was whipping
through there.</i>

42:29.485 --> 42:32.419
<i>I'd probably say it was
negative 80 with wind chill.</i>

42:32.421 --> 42:35.289
<i>And I remember
looking over at Chris Cavanaugh</i>

42:35.291 --> 42:37.791
<i>and tears were streaming
down his face.</i>

42:37.793 --> 42:39.793
<i>He didn't even know it
because it was so cold</i>

42:39.795 --> 42:41.729
<i>and the thing that surprised me</i>

42:41.731 --> 42:43.797
<i>is when he looked
at me a second time</i>

42:43.799 --> 42:46.200
those tears had frozen
to his face.

42:47.335 --> 42:50.037
<i>So that's...</i>

42:50.039 --> 42:51.939
<i>that made an impression on me.</i>

42:51.941 --> 42:53.907
<i>Maybe it's time to get inside.</i>

43:03.284 --> 43:05.119
We're about 30 K's away

43:05.121 --> 43:08.455
from the nearest seawater here
and it's still quite common

43:08.457 --> 43:10.090
to find guys like this.

43:10.092 --> 43:12.092
It's a mummified seal

43:12.094 --> 43:13.227
that's lost its way

43:13.229 --> 43:14.828
and wandered inland.

43:14.830 --> 43:16.897
It's an amazingly
common occurrence.

43:37.285 --> 43:39.153
<i>It's heartbreaking when you see</i>

43:39.155 --> 43:41.388
<i>animals in distress like this</i>

43:41.390 --> 43:43.157
<i>because we're not allowed
to interfere</i>

43:46.561 --> 43:49.129
<i>We just have to let nature
take its course.</i>

44:02.178 --> 44:04.012
<i>It can be really hard</i>

44:04.014 --> 44:07.048
<i>just being away from home
and hearing stories.</i>

44:07.050 --> 44:10.151
My sister just had a baby boy
a week ago.

44:10.153 --> 44:11.553
And that day was...

44:12.855 --> 44:13.888
really bittersweet.

44:13.890 --> 44:15.056
It was really cool,

44:15.058 --> 44:16.524
but man I wanted nothing
more than

44:16.526 --> 44:17.926
to get the hell out of here

44:17.928 --> 44:18.960
just for a day.

44:18.962 --> 44:20.962
Go home and enjoy that moment

44:20.964 --> 44:23.298
with my family
because they were all together

44:23.300 --> 44:25.433
and then I was down here,

44:25.435 --> 44:28.036
you know,
shooting emails out all day

44:28.038 --> 44:29.370
and then on the phone
a couple times

44:29.372 --> 44:30.505
and that was really really hard.

44:32.241 --> 44:33.942
So for me,

44:33.944 --> 44:36.611
what sucks is definitely

44:36.613 --> 44:38.847
missing family,
but more importantly

44:38.849 --> 44:40.849
missing these big moments
with them,

44:40.851 --> 44:41.850
you know,

44:41.852 --> 44:43.484
my family's lives back home.

44:47.556 --> 44:49.524
<i>Well, I mean,
first of all,</i>

44:49.526 --> 44:51.125
<i>I had my concerns.</i>

44:51.127 --> 44:52.527
<i>And this is what I do
always in my life</i>

44:52.529 --> 44:53.561
<i>that if I'm ever feeling low</i>

44:53.563 --> 44:55.597
<i>I have things around
just in case.</i>

44:55.599 --> 44:58.099
<i>One of the things is I brought
a lot of photos of my family</i>

44:58.101 --> 45:00.101
<i>so I have them taped
to my fridge.</i>

45:00.103 --> 45:01.402
And then I just know

45:01.404 --> 45:02.637
that there's always
people on my side

45:02.639 --> 45:05.406
even if it seems like the walls
are closing in down here.

45:15.384 --> 45:17.585
<i>It was just
like any other day</i>

45:17.587 --> 45:18.453
<i>and the phone rang.</i>

45:20.522 --> 45:22.156
<i>It was my grandmother</i>

45:22.158 --> 45:24.359
<i>and immediately
my heart sunk because</i>

45:24.361 --> 45:26.127
<i>I knew something was wrong.</i>

45:28.364 --> 45:31.566
<i>And she told me that
my father had passed away</i>

45:31.568 --> 45:33.167
<i>and...</i>

45:34.169 --> 45:35.370
<i>it was quite a shock.</i>

45:36.405 --> 45:38.206
<i>I never expected that</i>

45:38.208 --> 45:41.976
<i>it was...
it was really difficult.</i>

45:41.978 --> 45:44.679
<i>I mean,
when you lose a parent</i>

45:44.681 --> 45:48.549
<i>it's a big thing.
And to not be able</i>

45:48.551 --> 45:51.152
<i>to be with your family
during that time</i>

45:51.154 --> 45:54.656
<i>and not being able
to go to the funeral.</i>

45:54.658 --> 45:58.526
<i>I just...
it leaves things unfinished.</i>

46:04.266 --> 46:07.268
<i>I wanted to be there
for my family.</i>

46:07.270 --> 46:08.970
<i>I needed to be there</i>

46:08.972 --> 46:09.971
<i>and I couldn't.</i>

46:26.555 --> 46:29.225
<i>It's probably the most
isolated place on the planet</i>

46:29.227 --> 46:31.494
and that's really hard
to adjust to.

46:31.496 --> 46:33.730
I can see people who...

46:33.732 --> 46:36.433
one winter would be
enough for them.

46:39.303 --> 46:41.071
<i>It's really hard for a lot
of people.</i>

46:54.151 --> 46:55.452
<i>I found that there
was this curve</i>

46:55.454 --> 46:57.320
<i>where I just really
started missing like</i>

46:57.322 --> 46:58.722
<i>eating sushi and Indian food</i>

46:58.724 --> 47:00.190
<i>and going to movies
and just like...</i>

47:00.192 --> 47:01.257
the life.

47:01.259 --> 47:02.492
And then it became like so much

47:02.494 --> 47:04.160
that I just really
missed it a lot

47:04.162 --> 47:07.130
and then it just
dropped off and...

47:07.132 --> 47:08.231
I don't miss...

47:08.233 --> 47:09.632
I don't know if it's like

47:09.634 --> 47:11.368
a post-traumatic stress
disorder response

47:11.370 --> 47:12.736
or I don't want to think
about what I miss

47:12.738 --> 47:14.204
or I'll get really distressed
or what it is,

47:14.206 --> 47:16.573
but there's
not a lot that I miss.

47:16.575 --> 47:19.142
I've been thinking
about avocados lately.

47:19.144 --> 47:21.077
An avocado would be nice.

47:21.079 --> 47:22.312
You may want to have

47:23.381 --> 47:25.181
a toast with avocado

47:25.183 --> 47:27.717
and then you can only
dream about it.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.285
But simple as...

47:31.288 --> 47:33.757
black tea with fresh milk

47:33.759 --> 47:35.325
or perhaps even better

47:35.327 --> 47:37.093
with fresh cream.

47:37.095 --> 47:38.194
<i>Dark bread.</i>

47:39.697 --> 47:40.663
<i>Cauliflower.</i>

47:41.532 --> 47:43.199
<i>It's brilliant.</i>

47:43.201 --> 47:46.169
<i>Just to have
a fresh head of cauliflower</i>

47:46.171 --> 47:47.337
<i>would be very nice now.</i>

47:53.110 --> 47:54.477
Noooooo!

47:56.114 --> 47:58.415
It's no good we can't do
anything for him now

47:58.417 --> 48:00.283
<i>In the winter of 2008,</i>

48:00.285 --> 48:01.785
<i>I started a 48-hour</i>

48:01.787 --> 48:03.386
<i>Antarctic film festival.</i>

48:07.525 --> 48:11.294
<i>and invited all the bases
on the continent to participate.</i>

48:16.267 --> 48:17.634
<i>One of the greatest pleasures</i>

48:17.636 --> 48:19.502
<i>of watching these films
each year</i>

48:19.504 --> 48:23.173
<i>is just getting to see what
the other bases look like...</i>

48:26.477 --> 48:27.744
<i>and who else is out there</i>

48:27.746 --> 48:29.646
<i>wintering over
on the ice.</i>

48:46.330 --> 48:47.697
<i>Carolina,</i>

48:47.699 --> 48:48.798
<i>great to hear your voice.</i>

48:48.800 --> 48:50.300
Yes how are you?

48:51.602 --> 48:53.636
I'm good. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

48:53.638 --> 48:54.804
Everything's good here.

48:54.806 --> 48:56.474
Just um...

48:56.476 --> 48:57.274
having...

48:57.276 --> 48:59.510
having my breakfast
and some coffee.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.248
<i>How are your parents?</i>

49:26.671 --> 49:28.539
<i>Another hour?
- Ummm.</i>

49:32.878 --> 49:34.912
<i>Are we ever going
to see the sun again?</i>

49:35.747 --> 49:36.881
One day.

50:04.743 --> 50:06.410
<i>Guess you start to get used</i>

50:06.412 --> 50:08.179
<i>to living in a world
without light.</i>

50:11.416 --> 50:14.285
<i>The days get short
and the nights get long</i>

50:14.287 --> 50:16.420
<i>'till the nights get real long.</i>

50:16.422 --> 50:18.255
<i>Towards the end
of the month there...</i>

50:19.257 --> 50:20.624
there's no more sun

50:20.626 --> 50:23.894
and...
that's all she wrote.

50:49.888 --> 50:51.922
<i>I was scared
of the coming darkness</i>

50:51.924 --> 50:53.290
<i>the coming darkness</i>

50:53.292 --> 50:56.327
<i>for so many months
and I thought</i>

50:56.329 --> 50:57.561
is that going to get to me?

50:57.563 --> 50:59.230
Is that going to make me...

50:59.232 --> 51:00.331
well, how will that affect me?

51:00.333 --> 51:02.700
I was pretty scared of that
and how that might...

51:02.702 --> 51:05.369
<i>just change me.</i>

51:07.272 --> 51:08.839
<i>I would correspond
with winter-overs</i>

51:08.841 --> 51:10.441
<i>when I was off the ice</i>

51:10.443 --> 51:11.775
<i>and you could just
see it in their emails.</i>

51:12.844 --> 51:13.711
They would change.

51:13.713 --> 51:16.280
And I'm like wow
is that going to change me?

51:16.282 --> 51:17.348
I don't know.

51:22.788 --> 51:25.457
<i>As it is the light changes
enough in the sky</i>

51:25.459 --> 51:26.825
<i>that it's still seems to me</i>

51:26.827 --> 51:29.427
<i>that the sun is just
around the corner.</i>

51:29.429 --> 51:31.896
<i>And I think that's had a great
effect on me because</i>

51:31.898 --> 51:32.764
<i>it just reminds me that no,</i>

51:32.766 --> 51:33.999
<i>it's not just dark.</i>

51:34.900 --> 51:35.767
<i>Attention all stations</i>

51:35.769 --> 51:38.570
<i>standby for a severe
weather condition announcement.</i>

51:38.572 --> 51:41.406
<i>McMurdo weather has set
Severe Weather Condition One</i>

51:43.910 --> 51:46.945
<i>McMurdo Station, T-site,
Arrival Heights,</i>

51:46.947 --> 51:48.480
<i>Pegasus Field,</i>

51:48.482 --> 51:50.283
<i>Williams Field,
road to Williams Field...</i>

51:51.718 --> 51:52.918
Check this out.

51:55.722 --> 51:59.825
This is the entryway
to our dorm.

51:59.827 --> 52:02.361
Normally this has carpet
on the ground

52:02.363 --> 52:04.630
and the walls are just
normally walls, you know,

52:04.632 --> 52:05.898
But...

52:05.900 --> 52:07.500
We're going to open
the door right now

52:07.502 --> 52:08.668
and it's a little bit
like opening up

52:08.670 --> 52:09.835
the door to another world.

52:11.438 --> 52:13.005
Are you ready?

52:23.050 --> 52:25.017
It's a little bit blowy
out there right now.

52:43.704 --> 52:45.971
<i>You know,
when you watch television here</i>

52:45.973 --> 52:47.106
<i>and you see all the things</i>

52:47.108 --> 52:48.941
<i>that are going wrong
in the world</i>

52:48.943 --> 52:50.376
<i>you know that's...</i>

52:50.378 --> 52:51.544
<i>it's like thank
goodness I'm here.</i>

52:51.546 --> 52:53.846
<i>But then you also
then watch shows where</i>

52:53.848 --> 52:56.549
<i>you see swaying palm trees</i>

52:57.684 --> 52:59.819
<i>and people laughing</i>

52:59.821 --> 53:01.554
and bucolic scenes

53:01.556 --> 53:02.555
and you're not there.

53:02.557 --> 53:04.590
You're here where it's
dark and cold and windy.

54:01.549 --> 54:03.083
<i>I was out on the sea ice,</i>

54:03.085 --> 54:05.185
<i>and suddenly
off of Observation Hill</i>

54:05.187 --> 54:08.121
<i>comes rolling
these just waves...</i>

54:08.123 --> 54:10.190
<i>waves of green...</i>

54:10.192 --> 54:13.093
<i>like fairy dust.</i>

54:13.095 --> 54:14.561
Like a giant curtain
of fairy dust

54:14.563 --> 54:16.563
just kind of undulating
over me

54:16.565 --> 54:19.833
that filled the whole sky
and just moved in waves across.

54:19.835 --> 54:22.836
And I thought this is
either what it looks like

54:22.838 --> 54:24.137
if aliens are about
to abduct you.

54:24.139 --> 54:29.443
and almost like you feel like
you could reach up and touch it.

54:29.445 --> 54:31.678
Or if you're a person
who believes in Heaven...

54:31.680 --> 54:33.146
maybe this is what you see
when you go to Heaven.

54:33.148 --> 54:34.481
I'm not sure,

54:34.483 --> 54:37.150
but it was really an emotional
life-changing experience for me.

54:37.152 --> 54:41.188
I mean I really found myself
not realizing I'd done it.

54:41.190 --> 54:43.890
When I figured out
where my body position was

54:43.892 --> 54:46.760
I was actually on my knees
and I was crying.

54:46.762 --> 54:48.094
Like that's how beautiful
it was to me.

56:18.754 --> 56:19.887
It's the month of June

56:19.889 --> 56:22.590
and right now
it's the middle of the day.

56:49.618 --> 56:52.153
I grew up
in a very rural area

56:52.155 --> 56:54.055
so I could see
the stars very well...

56:54.057 --> 56:55.323
In rural Minnesota.

56:55.325 --> 56:56.857
And I've been in the mountains

56:56.859 --> 56:57.892
and, you know, Colorado.

56:57.894 --> 57:00.061
And I thought
wow the sky looks beautiful.

57:00.063 --> 57:02.196
But I never knew a star
could flash like...

57:02.198 --> 57:04.198
fluorescent pink...
fluorescent green...

57:04.200 --> 57:05.099
fluorescent blue...
white...

57:05.101 --> 57:06.300
just in that rotation.

57:06.302 --> 57:07.602
just blink-blink-
blink-blink-blink.

57:07.604 --> 57:09.136
One star like...

57:09.138 --> 57:10.304
it looks like a strobe
light to me.

57:10.306 --> 57:13.208
There's a lot of them
that look

57:13.210 --> 57:14.676
like a strobe light
up there.

57:14.678 --> 57:15.711
And you would
never know...

57:15.713 --> 57:17.012
you'd never know...

57:17.014 --> 57:18.614
what the sky looks like.

57:19.349 --> 57:21.016
It's wonderful.

57:57.020 --> 58:00.656
<i>I loved the 24 hours
of darkness.</i>

58:00.658 --> 58:03.025
<i>Maybe on full moon nights,
and other nights,</i>

58:03.027 --> 58:03.759
<i>I would see the mountains.</i>

58:03.761 --> 58:06.094
<i>But sometimes I'd forget
the mountains were even there.</i>

58:06.096 --> 58:09.331
<i>And so my entire world
was just in the little spaces</i>

58:09.333 --> 58:10.899
<i>and walking around.</i>

58:16.673 --> 58:19.107
<i>It really does
change your perception.</i>

58:44.067 --> 58:45.367
<i>Towards the end of summer,</i>

58:45.369 --> 58:47.236
<i>the thing I was most
looking forward to was</i>

58:47.238 --> 58:48.938
<i>seeing darkness again.</i>

58:48.940 --> 58:51.007
<i>Like I just wanted
to see some nighttime.</i>

58:54.011 --> 58:55.178
<i>And now that it's night time.</i>

58:56.847 --> 59:00.083
<i>I don't really miss the day
that much right now.</i>

59:05.389 --> 59:07.390
<i>We have three dinners
here each year.</i>

59:07.392 --> 59:09.792
<i>Of course our sunset
now at the midwinter,</i>

59:09.794 --> 59:13.062
and as we all know
that sun rise isn't far away.

59:14.732 --> 59:16.766
So I'd like you
to charge your glasses

59:16.768 --> 59:19.302
and to friendships
and long-lasting friendships.

59:19.304 --> 59:20.203
Thank you.

59:20.205 --> 59:21.471
Cheers!

59:24.742 --> 59:26.275
Cheers!

59:30.380 --> 59:32.048
It's very cool that there is

59:32.050 --> 59:34.050
a unique holiday in Antarctica

59:34.052 --> 59:37.019
that people from all
over the world celebrate

59:37.021 --> 59:38.387
and we send greetings
to each other,

59:38.389 --> 59:39.355
and good will to each other,

59:39.357 --> 59:41.424
and remember the history
that brought us here

59:41.426 --> 59:42.859
in the first place

59:42.861 --> 59:44.460
and the goals
of what we're up to

59:44.462 --> 59:45.428
here in the first place.

59:53.838 --> 59:56.139
And it's just...

59:56.141 --> 59:57.507
it's wonderful.

59:57.509 --> 59:59.509
I really liked
the mid-winter time.

01:00:26.203 --> 01:00:28.104
Oh God.

01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:35.578
Well, that woke me up.

01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:38.080
Come on, Brody.

01:00:38.082 --> 01:00:39.015
Do it. Do it.
Do it.

01:00:49.493 --> 01:00:50.226
How is it?

01:00:50.228 --> 01:00:51.394
Cold.

01:00:55.032 --> 01:00:57.233
<i>The other day
I came in from outside</i>

01:00:57.235 --> 01:01:00.203
<i>and Christine asked me
is it cold outside today?</i>

01:01:00.205 --> 01:01:01.070
<i>And I said
"Oh no.</i>

01:01:01.072 --> 01:01:02.205
<i>It's not too bad. "</i>

01:01:02.207 --> 01:01:04.407
<i>And then it struck me...</i>

01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:05.441
<i>the absurdity
of the conversation</i>

01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:07.176
because we're in Antarctica,

01:01:07.178 --> 01:01:08.578
It's the middle of winter,

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.180
and she's asking me
if it's cold outside.

01:01:11.182 --> 01:01:13.584
And secondly
it was 40 below.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.319
We haven't seen
the sun for months

01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:17.054
and I thought it was a nice day.

01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:21.124
So it's fascinating
the way our perceptions

01:01:21.126 --> 01:01:24.361
of what we consider normal
have shifted.

01:01:25.263 --> 01:01:27.130
<i>Nine, zero, six.
Firehouse</i>

01:01:28.933 --> 01:01:30.467
<i>Go for nine, zero, six.</i>

01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:32.269
Hey just checking
on the progress

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.037
is Scott Base road open again?

01:01:34.039 --> 01:01:37.341
That is a negative.
We need 10 more minutes.

01:01:37.343 --> 01:01:41.078
<i>Being in this office-type
setting under fluorescents</i>

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.880
<i>for the six-day work week,</i>

01:01:42.882 --> 01:01:45.415
I think that ended up
being much more...

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.584
of a challenge
because I wasn't outside

01:01:47.586 --> 01:01:49.152
and doing anything.

01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:50.254
Firehouse, Genevieve.

01:01:52.123 --> 01:01:53.223
Sure, one sec.

01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:58.462
<i>Trying to break out
of that rut of just...</i>

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.430
<i>waking...
going to work...</i>

01:02:00.432 --> 01:02:02.266
<i>eating...
sleeping...</i>

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:04.902
<i>and doing it all over again.</i>

01:02:04.904 --> 01:02:06.169
Firehouse, Genevieve.

01:02:14.979 --> 01:02:16.580
<i>A lot of people work
the same thing</i>

01:02:16.582 --> 01:02:17.514
<i>every day</i>

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:21.618
<i>and they're not used
to repetitive motions</i>

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.121
<i>in their actions.</i>

01:02:24.123 --> 01:02:26.256
It can be kind of tiring

01:02:26.258 --> 01:02:27.624
just to do
the same thing every day

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:29.459
You have to bring some
spice into it.

01:02:36.302 --> 01:02:37.502
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:02:42.107 --> 01:02:45.710
Francis,
your chef at McMurdo,

01:02:47.079 --> 01:02:49.213
we exchange a few.

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:53.217
He brought his mead

01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:55.720
and I gave him a bottle,

01:02:55.722 --> 01:02:57.522
this mixed nine bottle.

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:59.691
And he says it's a very
good drink.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:02.427
So well,
tell me what you think?

01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:04.295
<i>Cheers.
- L'chaim.</i>

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:10.668
<i>The winter season sets up
and offers more</i>

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.704
<i>of an introspective outlook...</i>

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.141
<i>where you can
take the time to read</i>

01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:18.409
<i>or work on a craft.</i>

01:03:19.678 --> 01:03:20.712
<i>There's still times</i>

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:24.315
<i>But I think it really helps</i>

01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:26.184
<i>if you can
spend that time alone.</i>

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:32.490
<i>There's no substitute for just
having a good book in your hand.</i>

01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:34.425
Andrew Weil.

01:03:34.427 --> 01:03:37.528
Now it's a very small
small print here.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.763
Biblical Hebrew.

01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:41.166
Grammar of biblical Hebrew.

01:03:41.168 --> 01:03:43.135
<i>I knit.</i>

01:03:43.137 --> 01:03:46.171
<i>It keeps away the feeling
of stir craziness in the winter</i>

01:03:46.173 --> 01:03:48.507
<i>when I just feel like I might
like to tear my hair out</i>

01:03:48.509 --> 01:03:49.508
<i>and run outside screaming.</i>

01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:46.598
<i>Towards the end of winter</i>

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.734
<i>the extreme cold,
the fatigue,</i>

01:04:48.736 --> 01:04:52.104
<i>and constant lack of sunlight
or any new stimulus</i>

01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:55.374
<i>creates a condition
called T3 Syndrome.</i>

01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:57.209
<i>Attention all stations,</i>

01:04:57.211 --> 01:04:58.644
<i>standby for a severe weather
condition announcement.</i>

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:00.145
<i>The N-S-S...</i>

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.649
<i>N - S - F station manager,</i>

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:06.385
<i>has set severe weather
condition one for...</i>

01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:10.255
<i>the following locations.</i>

01:05:10.257 --> 01:05:11.523
<i>So I work at the store,</i>

01:05:11.525 --> 01:05:13.826
<i>and we open every day at 11:30,</i>

01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:15.661
<i>and almost every day</i>

01:05:15.663 --> 01:05:16.829
<i>this person comes in</i>

01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:20.432
<i>and buys something at like
11:35 or 11:40.</i>

01:05:20.434 --> 01:05:21.366
<i>We have the same conversation.</i>

01:05:21.368 --> 01:05:26.138
<i>I usually give him
a pack of cigarettes.</i>

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.673
<i>And the other day
at about the same time</i>

01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:29.641
<i>he comes in
and he goes "Wow!</i>

01:05:29.643 --> 01:05:31.610
I didn't know
you guys opened at this time.

01:05:31.612 --> 01:05:33.512
Have you always been open
at this time?"

01:05:33.514 --> 01:05:35.114
And I was like,

01:05:35.116 --> 01:05:37.449
"So and so,
you come in every single day.

01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:40.352
You buy the same thing
every single day. "

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:41.320
And he was just like,

01:05:41.322 --> 01:05:43.422
"Wow, I never thought you guys
were open at this time. "

01:05:43.424 --> 01:05:45.190
and he just kind of
wandered off.

01:05:49.796 --> 01:05:51.563
Firehouse, Genevieve.

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:55.167
<i>A couple of days ago
Talie called and I said</i>

01:05:55.169 --> 01:05:56.135
<i>"Oh, Talie,
I'm so glad you called.</i>

01:05:56.137 --> 01:05:58.737
<i>I was just thinking about...
I was thinking about you.</i>

01:05:58.739 --> 01:06:00.139
<i>I was just about to page you. "</i>

01:06:00.141 --> 01:06:01.173
<i>And she said,
"Well you did page me. "</i>

01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:04.209
So I had completely forgotten
that I had paged her.

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:06.778
And that seems to happen
more times than not.

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.782
<i>There was a time where...
I was... had to go outside</i>

01:06:09.784 --> 01:06:13.419
<i>and the chief she
tossed down a pair of boots.</i>

01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:15.455
<i>I go ahead
and I put them on</i>

01:06:15.457 --> 01:06:17.223
<i>and I'm walking around in them</i>

01:06:17.225 --> 01:06:18.591
they feel really weird.

01:06:19.493 --> 01:06:20.727
I don't know why.

01:06:20.729 --> 01:06:23.329
I get to the door of the bay

01:06:23.331 --> 01:06:25.498
where I'm leaving and...

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.466
and I look down and...

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:28.635
they're on the wrong feet.

01:06:28.637 --> 01:06:31.204
So I walk back,
I pull them off.

01:06:31.206 --> 01:06:33.940
I take the right boot off
and set it down.

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:36.543
And take the left boot off
and set it down.

01:06:36.545 --> 01:06:37.810
I pick up the first one

01:06:37.912 --> 01:06:39.879
and put it on the same foot
I just had it on

01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:40.647
and put on the...

01:06:40.649 --> 01:06:43.650
So I had basically
taken them off

01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:44.751
and put them back
on the wrong feet

01:06:44.753 --> 01:06:46.486
and walked outside again.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.357
<i>I've been coming down here
since '99</i>

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:52.926
<i>so it's kind of...</i>

01:06:52.928 --> 01:06:54.727
it's all the same
to me pretty much.

01:06:54.729 --> 01:06:58.264
It's gone.
My memory is gone.

01:06:58.266 --> 01:07:01.267
I remember trying to call my Dad

01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:04.237
at the same phone number
I grew up with.

01:07:04.239 --> 01:07:05.371
I couldn't remember it.

01:07:05.373 --> 01:07:08.508
I caught myself trying to...

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:10.310
It took me over 10 seconds

01:07:10.312 --> 01:07:14.948
to remember if S came before
or after T in the alphabet.

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:17.217
And that was like a sign.

01:07:17.219 --> 01:07:19.786
I need to get up
and away from my desk

01:07:19.887 --> 01:07:20.753
and get a grip.

01:07:21.822 --> 01:07:22.755
Ahhhhh.

01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:25.625
Ahhhhh.

01:07:28.596 --> 01:07:31.798
I've started saying "Ahhh"
a lot more

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.366
than I ever used to
and it's not something

01:07:33.368 --> 01:07:34.267
I mean to do.

01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:37.270
it's just something that
I use to fill the time

01:07:37.272 --> 01:07:39.939
where I never did that before
I came down here.

01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:41.941
I never, I mean,
I would say "Ah",

01:07:41.943 --> 01:07:44.010
but I would never say
"Ahhhhhhhhhhh. "

01:07:45.679 --> 01:07:47.447
You ahhhh...

01:07:47.449 --> 01:07:49.415
I just had a T3 moment.

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:52.518
I totally forgot
my line of thinking.

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.291
Sorry, what was
the original question?

01:08:25.053 --> 01:08:28.622
<i>If there's any way
to bottle or bring in</i>

01:08:28.624 --> 01:08:30.924
<i>just the smell of summer...</i>

01:08:30.926 --> 01:08:32.493
<i>the scent of flowers...</i>

01:08:32.495 --> 01:08:34.395
<i>and of rain and of green grass</i>

01:08:34.397 --> 01:08:35.462
<i>and of rivers.</i>

01:08:38.968 --> 01:08:42.604
<i>The smell of crops and corn</i>

01:08:42.606 --> 01:08:44.406
<i>and just the smell of dirt.</i>

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:47.008
<i>There's no smell of dirt here.</i>

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.943
<i>It's all volcanic.</i>

01:08:55.818 --> 01:08:56.751
<i>Oh man.</i>

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.787
<i>I miss the rain</i>

01:08:58.788 --> 01:09:01.022
<i>and trees and water and...</i>

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:06.060
family and my knuckle-head
nephews.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:07.696
You do miss out on quite a bit.

01:09:08.964 --> 01:09:11.633
You do make some sacrifices
coming down here.

01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:22.410
<i>I probably
would never repeat winter.</i>

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:23.978
<i>The problem is...</i>

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:25.113
you never know

01:09:25.115 --> 01:09:26.613
who you'll end up with.

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:35.990
<i>You almost feel
like you're stuck...</i>

01:09:35.992 --> 01:09:37.559
<i>stuck in a really small town</i>

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.728
<i>and there's nothing
else out there...</i>

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:42.863
<i>until the sun starts coming out.</i>

01:09:42.866 --> 01:09:44.966
And then you realize
where you are again.

01:10:05.087 --> 01:10:07.622
<i>There's a great feeling
of anticipation</i>

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:08.990
<i>when twilight begins</i>

01:10:08.992 --> 01:10:10.992
<i>to creep back into the sky
in August.</i>

01:10:12.728 --> 01:10:14.963
<i>It's a bit like being
a child again</i>

01:10:14.965 --> 01:10:16.398
<i>waiting for Christmas.</i>

01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:22.670
<i>August is also the coldest
time of the year.</i>

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.576
<i>And nacreous clouds
will start to form a lot more.</i>

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.481
<i>Although this is part
of the process</i>

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:36.050
<i>that is destroying
the ozone layer,</i>

01:10:36.052 --> 01:10:37.952
<i>when the sun finally
does hit them</i>

01:10:37.954 --> 01:10:39.521
<i>it can look incredible.</i>

01:10:39.523 --> 01:10:41.756
<i>like the entire sky
in on fire.</i>

01:11:15.992 --> 01:11:18.027
<i>Seeing the sun is always still</i>

01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:19.895
<i>the most amazing experience.</i>

01:11:19.897 --> 01:11:22.531
<i>I wait for it
I wait for it to come back.</i>

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.662
<i>And then there'll be that
moment where I see it.</i>

01:11:53.664 --> 01:11:55.664
And I never know when
that moment is going to be.

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:57.633
But when it happens,

01:11:57.635 --> 01:11:59.902
I just have to stop
wherever I am.

01:11:59.904 --> 01:12:01.904
Stop in my tracks
and I just look at it.

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:04.607
I just want it to fill
the inside of my head,

01:12:04.609 --> 01:12:07.109
<i>just let that sun
come right through my eyes.</i>

01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:08.711
<i>It's the life-giving thing.</i>

01:12:45.582 --> 01:12:47.583
Okay, away you go.

01:12:47.585 --> 01:12:49.618
In this cup is boiling water.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.221
It's 40 below zero outside.

01:12:52.223 --> 01:12:53.923
This is what happens
when you throw

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:56.892
boiling hot water
into 40 below zero air.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.127
Here we go.

01:13:25.256 --> 01:13:29.092
<i>The Population on base
suddenly doubles at Winfly</i>

01:13:29.094 --> 01:13:31.294
<i>and for those of us
who have wintered over</i>

01:13:31.296 --> 01:13:33.898
<i>the arrival of a whole
new crowd of faces</i>

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.666
<i>can be a bit bewildering.</i>

01:13:44.743 --> 01:13:46.978
<i>It's kind of crazy.</i>

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.747
<i>I think people either
are energized by it</i>

01:13:49.749 --> 01:13:51.048
<i>or just the opposite.</i>

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:53.384
They have energy drawn
from them

01:13:53.386 --> 01:13:55.620
and I would tend to be
one of those people

01:13:55.622 --> 01:13:57.788
who have energy drawn from me.

01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:00.691
I'm not a big fan
of when all the folks come in.

01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:07.331
<i>For six months you've seen
only the same people every day.</i>

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:09.200
<i>There hasn't been anyone new.</i>

01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:12.403
<i>All of a sudden you've got all
these new people coming through.</i>

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:15.306
<i>Kind of this feeling
of glee and happiness</i>

01:14:15.308 --> 01:14:17.742
mixed with revulsion
like, "Aggghhh, stay away!"

01:14:22.814 --> 01:14:25.049
And I've even seen
winter-overs kind of hide

01:14:25.051 --> 01:14:27.752
behind corners
and kind of look out.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.094
<i>We've had a closed community
over the winter</i>

01:14:37.096 --> 01:14:39.163
<i>and there's been no germs,
no one gets sick.</i>

01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:42.767
<i>But new people come in...
new germs.</i>

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:45.336
<i>They all have all this energy
and they're orange.</i>

01:14:45.338 --> 01:14:47.705
<i>I mean we always talk
about the orange people</i>

01:14:47.707 --> 01:14:48.773
<i>because they're tanned.</i>

01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:53.110
You don't really realize
how pale we all are

01:14:53.112 --> 01:14:54.845
from lack of sunshine.

01:15:01.119 --> 01:15:02.787
<i>Just walking through the galley,</i>

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:05.322
I felt like I was moving
at this little pace

01:15:05.324 --> 01:15:07.692
and everyone else
was rushing around...

01:15:07.694 --> 01:15:09.093
around me.

01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:19.403
I was surprised at how
territorial we all were.

01:15:19.405 --> 01:15:22.740
I remember getting back
from the flight line

01:15:22.742 --> 01:15:24.141
and coming straight to dinner.

01:15:25.043 --> 01:15:28.112
And I got my tray
and my plate

01:15:28.947 --> 01:15:32.183
<i>and I looked up
and I saw a line.</i>

01:15:32.185 --> 01:15:34.385
<i>And I was so livid</i>

01:15:34.387 --> 01:15:36.353
<i>that I had to wait in line.</i>

01:15:37.456 --> 01:15:38.456
<i>These new people they</i>

01:15:38.458 --> 01:15:39.423
<i>weren't with the program yet.</i>

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:41.125
<i>They didn't know
what they were doing</i>

01:15:41.127 --> 01:15:43.094
<i>the whole routine
was messed up.</i>

01:15:43.096 --> 01:15:44.061
<i>And I was so livid.</i>

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:46.864
<i>I felt like I could have
stabbed somebody with a fork.</i>

01:15:50.736 --> 01:15:52.303
<i>And I didn't understand it.</i>

01:15:52.305 --> 01:15:54.271
<i>I'm like,
"Why am I so angry?"</i>

01:16:02.014 --> 01:16:03.148
I couldn't eat in the galley.

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:04.816
I went up to my room.

01:16:04.818 --> 01:16:06.485
And...
I'm sitting in my room

01:16:06.487 --> 01:16:08.186
for about 5 minutes
contemplating about

01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:10.756
why I was so angry.

01:16:10.758 --> 01:16:12.924
And then I get knocks on my door

01:16:12.926 --> 01:16:15.293
and it's the rest
of the Firehouse.

01:16:15.295 --> 01:16:16.828
"Can we eat in here with you?"

01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:18.797
Yeah.

01:16:18.799 --> 01:16:19.965
So we sat down
and for half an hour

01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:21.366
we ate our meals watching TV.

01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:25.170
Didn't say a word to each other
and it was beautiful.

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:46.525
<i>The first few days,</i>

01:16:46.527 --> 01:16:48.026
<i>or maybe the first week,</i>

01:16:48.028 --> 01:16:50.162
<i>is kind of a culture shock.</i>

01:16:51.297 --> 01:16:53.198
You know,
the dynamics change.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.833
The noise level rises.

01:16:55.868 --> 01:16:59.070
<i>But after that
the new people that come here</i>

01:16:59.072 --> 01:17:01.206
<i>they have so much energy</i>

01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:03.909
<i>and I find that it brings me up.</i>

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:06.945
<i>And I actually get more excited
about getting stuff done</i>

01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:08.847
<i>and moving around.</i>

01:17:08.849 --> 01:17:09.915
It kind of wakes me up.

01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:14.486
Keri, how does it feel to have
a fresh apple after 6 months?

01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:20.959
Orange, apple?

01:17:20.961 --> 01:17:22.127
Why don't you take
that behind doors?

01:17:22.129 --> 01:17:23.862
<i>I'm sure I'll get one very soon.</i>

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:30.569
Be gentle with the banana.

01:18:02.368 --> 01:18:03.869
<i>I would love to be able</i>

01:18:03.871 --> 01:18:05.337
<i>to show the people
who I love the most</i>

01:18:05.339 --> 01:18:06.638
<i>what it looks like down here...</i>

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.340
what the sky looks like
down here in winter.

01:18:12.645 --> 01:18:14.379
<i>Because they're never
going to see it.</i>

01:18:24.624 --> 01:18:26.091
<i>It's funny.</i>

01:18:26.093 --> 01:18:28.227
<i>Right before winter started
we'd tell these stories</i>

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:32.265
<i>about how you'd get T3
and you get pale</i>

01:18:32.267 --> 01:18:35.501
<i>and you're just
emotional sometimes.</i>

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:37.638
<i>And these people
who have never wintered</i>

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.106
<i>are looking at us
like we're freaks.</i>

01:18:39.108 --> 01:18:40.440
<i>Like why would you ever</i>

01:18:40.442 --> 01:18:42.576
<i>put yourself through
something like that?</i>

01:18:48.583 --> 01:18:50.350
<i>And then, at the end,</i>

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.287
<i>we'd look at each other and say,</i>

01:18:54.455 --> 01:18:55.589
"Winter's the best.

01:18:57.592 --> 01:18:58.692
It's the greatest. "

01:19:09.137 --> 01:19:11.238
<i>I try and explain
the experience,</i>

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.308
<i>the Antarctic experience,
to people back home,</i>

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:16.610
<i>and they love
hearing about it.</i>

01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:18.412
<i>The stories and what it's like.</i>

01:19:19.347 --> 01:19:22.482
<i>But, you know that...</i>

01:19:22.484 --> 01:19:24.418
they just...
they will never get it.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:29.222
They'll never fully comprehend
what it's like down here.

01:20:46.734 --> 01:20:49.302
So if you were to spend
another year down here

01:20:49.304 --> 01:20:51.171
<i>what would you do differently?</i>

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.709
<i>Not bring as much stuff.</i>

01:21:08.123 --> 01:21:10.558
I've met some of the best people
in the world here.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.395
And I think a lot of that is
because of the fact

01:21:14.397 --> 01:21:16.097
that those of us that come here

01:21:16.099 --> 01:21:18.433
<i>always have a kind
of a spirit of adventure.</i>

01:21:18.435 --> 01:21:22.470
<i>And that's something
that kind of binds us together.</i>

01:21:33.682 --> 01:21:35.450
<i>These might be...</i>

01:21:35.452 --> 01:21:37.418
<i>the golden years of Antarctica.</i>

01:21:41.824 --> 01:21:44.392
<i>Right now,
what is being done is science.</i>

01:21:44.394 --> 01:21:46.094
<i>Right now there's
a treaty that says</i>

01:21:46.096 --> 01:21:48.629
<i>you get to be here
to cooperate,</i>

01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:49.464
<i>look for peace,</i>

01:21:49.466 --> 01:21:51.532
<i>and look for knowledge
for mankind.</i>

01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:54.168
<i>And I just can't think
of another place</i>

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:56.771
<i>where that's really going on
so I feel really privileged</i>

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:59.774
to be a citizen
of Antarctica right now.

01:21:59.776 --> 01:22:01.442
I really really do.

01:22:01.444 --> 01:22:04.145
<i>And some day,
somebody is going to find a way</i>

01:22:04.147 --> 01:22:05.146
<i>to get oil commercially.</i>

01:22:05.148 --> 01:22:06.881
<i>And some day,
the treaty is going to end</i>

01:22:06.883 --> 01:22:10.251
<i>And some day,
you know...</i>

01:22:10.253 --> 01:22:12.320
<i>I don't know that we'll always
be able to play as nice</i>

01:22:12.322 --> 01:22:14.355
<i>as we can right now.</i>

01:22:40.349 --> 01:22:43.451
<i>You come down here
out of a sense of adventure.</i>

01:22:45.621 --> 01:22:47.688
<i>But then it gets
its hooks in you.</i>

01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:49.423
<i>and you realize</i>

01:22:49.425 --> 01:22:51.359
<i>how magic and fragile
it all is.</i>

01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:53.694
<i>And if we're not careful,</i>

01:22:53.696 --> 01:22:55.630
<i>if we're not conscientious,</i>

01:22:55.632 --> 01:22:57.598
<i>It could all get ruined.</i>

01:23:16.185 --> 01:23:19.253
<i>Imagine you live in a house.</i>

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:22.591
<i>And this is just one room
in your house...</i>

01:23:22.593 --> 01:23:24.960
<i>a cold room
where nobody lives.</i>

01:23:24.962 --> 01:23:27.829
<i>But it's still
a room in your house</i>

01:23:27.831 --> 01:23:31.633
<i>and as such you have
to care about this room.</i>

01:23:31.635 --> 01:23:34.970
<i>And you have to know
about what's going on there.</i>

01:23:47.817 --> 01:23:50.953
<i>There is a good expression
in the English language:</i>

01:23:50.955 --> 01:23:52.421
<i>peace of mind.</i>

01:23:52.423 --> 01:23:53.956
I really like it.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:23:58.228
Peace of mind
is a very nice thing to have.

01:24:07.938 --> 01:24:10.406
<i>The friends you make
and the memories</i>

01:24:10.408 --> 01:24:13.343
<i>that you take from here
last a lifetime.</i>

01:24:13.345 --> 01:24:15.912
<i>I've met guys who were
down here 50 years ago</i>

01:24:15.914 --> 01:24:17.480
who would like nothing
more in the world

01:24:17.482 --> 01:24:19.682
than the chance
to come back again...

01:24:19.684 --> 01:24:21.284
<i>just one more time.</i>

01:24:26.624 --> 01:24:29.993
<i>You know you can never really
call this place home.</i>

01:24:29.995 --> 01:24:33.463
<i>But at the same time
there's a familiarity</i>

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:35.465
<i>that just builds up.</i>

01:24:38.502 --> 01:24:40.970
<i>I definitely long for it
when I'm away.</i>

01:25:28.085 --> 01:25:30.420
<i>I fully expect
that my time here</i>

01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.588
<i>is not going to end
on my terms.</i>

01:25:33.857 --> 01:25:35.692
<i>The program could change</i>

01:25:35.694 --> 01:25:37.393
<i>or I might not pass
the physical...</i>

01:25:38.562 --> 01:25:40.396
<i>or there might not be a job.</i>

01:25:43.767 --> 01:25:46.469
<i>No one gets to stay
here indefinitely.</i>

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:56.013
<i>And then the time comes
when it's you turn to leave</i>

01:25:56.015 --> 01:25:58.349
<i>and you never really
do know for sure</i>

01:25:58.351 --> 01:26:00.017
<i>if you'll ever be back again.</i>

01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:14.992
<i>One of the things I recall</i>

01:27:14.994 --> 01:27:18.095
<i>in the process
of reacclimating to society</i>

01:27:18.097 --> 01:27:21.098
<i>was a Monday morning.</i>

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.468
<i>It's probably 8:30
in the morning</i>

01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:26.904
<i>and I am stuck in traffic.</i>

01:27:28.206 --> 01:27:30.641
<i>I remember looking
at all the cars around me.</i>

01:27:30.643 --> 01:27:33.744
<i>Everybody's...
they're in their own little...</i>

01:27:33.746 --> 01:27:36.480
<i>They're in the grind
of the world.</i>

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:39.883
<i>And I can't help
but look at everybody else</i>

01:27:39.885 --> 01:27:41.785
<i>and think...</i>

01:27:41.787 --> 01:27:42.786
<i>they're cattle.</i>

01:27:42.788 --> 01:27:46.590
<i>It's just one big herd
moving from point A to point B.</i>

01:27:46.592 --> 01:27:50.794
<i>and... at that point</i>

01:27:50.796 --> 01:27:52.863
<i>I wanted to be back
on the Ice again.</i>

01:28:33.005 --> 01:28:34.539
<i>It's not until you get
off the Ice</i>

01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:37.742
<i>that you realize the absence
of smell that we have here...</i>

01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:39.677
<i>the absence of odors.</i>

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:42.180
<i>So yeah...</i>

01:28:42.182 --> 01:28:44.115
<i>you can go
to the Botanical Gardens</i>

01:28:44.117 --> 01:28:46.084
<i>for an olfactory overload.</i>

01:28:57.997 --> 01:29:01.032
<i>I'm going to go
to the New World Supermarket</i>

01:29:01.034 --> 01:29:03.601
<i>and I'm going to stand
in the produce section</i>

01:29:03.603 --> 01:29:05.603
<i>and just smell the air</i>

01:29:05.605 --> 01:29:06.905
<i>for about 15 minutes.</i>

01:29:06.907 --> 01:29:11.843
some really good
chewy crusty bread,

01:29:11.845 --> 01:29:14.145
a hunk of really good
blue cheese,

01:29:14.147 --> 01:29:17.849
an avocado and some
red grapes with no seeds.

01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:22.821
And that's what I'm going to eat
for like 3 meals.

01:29:22.823 --> 01:29:25.858
There comes a point
in the winter

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.027
when...

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.728
at least us, the guys,

01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:30.796
us in the Firehouse,

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.665
we stop talking about women.

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:35.601
And we start talking
about food

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:38.070
because it's a much more
realistic prospect.

01:29:40.006 --> 01:29:41.674
So...

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:43.642
I've narrowed it down.
I'm going to go

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:46.312
and I'm going to have
steak and lobster.

01:29:47.614 --> 01:29:49.214
I'm going to splurge.

01:29:50.183 --> 01:29:53.085
Fresh vegetables with flavor.

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:57.823
A bean burrito from Taco Bell.

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:58.891
<i>Dark bread.</i>

01:30:00.026 --> 01:30:01.093
Avocado.

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:04.630
Cauliflower.

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.999
A bowl of cornflakes
with real milk

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:09.101
and sliced bananas.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:12.338
Eggs Benedict at the Boulevard
in New Zealand.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.908
Anything in Christchurch
is always good.

01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:17.376
Anything non-institutional.

01:30:19.212 --> 01:30:22.815
When I get back to New Zealand
the first thing I long to do

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:25.751
well first, first thing is go
through the Botanic Gardens

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:28.921
and just touch the grass
and smell the flowers.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.056
But then I try to get
to the ocean

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.091
to see that motion I guess.

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.230
<i>- You're standing on
the ocean now. - Exactly.</i>

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:36.729
That's what's so funny.
And I'm a mountain girl,

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.330
so it's never been
a draw before.

01:30:42.135 --> 01:30:44.169
<i>Walk barefoot in grass.</i>

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:51.011
<i>I'm going to fly straight home
to Washington State.</i>

01:30:51.013 --> 01:30:54.714
And I'm going to fly-fish
my brains out for about 3 weeks

01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:56.249
going for salmon and steel head.

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:59.119
And when I puke,
I think that's when I'll stop.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.889
I really like going to sleep
in my own bed.

01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:05.258
I really like...
Oh rain.

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.193
Just hearing the rain
and seeing it

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.696
feeling it again.
Wonderful

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.666
<i>I plan on doing nothing.</i>

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:15.168
I hope it rains at least one day
while I'm in Christchurch,

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:17.037
just so I can
wander around in the rain.

01:31:17.039 --> 01:31:17.837
I'd love that.

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:21.041
I hope it's...
I want some rain.

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:26.780
Have a decent sleep.

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:29.949
Have a decent sleep
for a few days.

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.819
I don't know.

01:31:33.954 --> 01:31:36.322
Check into a hotel room
and take a bath.

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.438
My brain is freezing.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:53.907
Let me think.

01:31:53.909 --> 01:31:56.743
I think my brain is freezing now
and I can't think.

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.880
Skip that question.
