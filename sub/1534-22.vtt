00:04.332 --> 00:05.733
But Rumplestiltskin can.

00:05.767 --> 00:07.401
Want to find who wrote this book

00:07.435 --> 00:10.370

"Do we really need color?"

[Laughs]

00:44.071 --> 00:47.173
Do we need to settle for what came before?

00:47.207 --> 00:49.808
Don't you want to really see the world?

00:49.843 --> 00:51.444
It's a complicated place,

00:51.478 --> 00:53.912
and people are complex creatures.

00:53.947 --> 00:55.515
Their interior lives are painted

Does it have a clicker?

01:08.028 --> 01:09.327
What?

01:09.362 --> 01:10.595
A clicker.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.931
You mean the space command remote?

01:15.368 --> 01:18.270
Why, that's included in the price, sir.

Dark One has in store for me

speculating what he wants.

06:36.366 --> 06:37.499
We just need to stop it.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.133
And if there's nothing useful here,

06:39.168 --> 06:39.934
we need to move on,

06:39.969 --> 06:41.813
find something else that can help.

06:41.907 --> 06:44.075

anything more about The Author.

06:48.189 --> 06:49.423
He doesn't, but he knows someone who does.

06:49.423 --> 06:50.481
That's why I called him here.

06:50.516 --> 06:51.281
Who?

06:51.315 --> 06:53.417
The man who gave him his power...

06:53.451 --> 06:54.384
The Apprentice.

06:54.419 --> 06:57.421
I met him once when I was living in Phuket.

06:57.455 --> 06:59.523
He was the one who told
me about the story book

06:59.558 --> 07:01.525
and that I should learn
everything about it.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.726

could you find him?

07:02.761 --> 07:05.162

07:07.698 --> 07:09.273

07:11.221 --> 07:12.287
I know this man.

07:12.322 --> 07:14.189
You do?

07:14.224 --> 07:17.459
More importantly, I know
exactly where to find him.

07:19.229 --> 07:21.497
I trapped him in there. I didn't know.

07:21.532 --> 07:23.165
It's okay. It was Gold, not you.

07:23.199 --> 07:24.866
Blue was in there. She can get him out.

07:24.901 --> 07:27.403
Don't you need the Dark One's dagger?

07:27.437 --> 07:29.938
Well, not if I have something
that belonged to The Apprentice.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.520
- Are you...
- Yes.

08:02.311 --> 08:05.446
And there is no time to waste.

08:05.531 --> 08:08.299
Isaac has abused his power for too long.

08:08.384 --> 08:10.401
The time has come to set...

08:11.737 --> 08:13.538
things right.

08:13.589 --> 08:14.869
Regina: How?

08:15.065 --> 08:17.033
By putting him back where
he can't harm anyone...

08:17.084 --> 08:18.918
in the book.

08:19.002 --> 08:22.538
I will need the page with
the painted door and the key.

08:22.606 --> 08:24.340
We shall return him to his prison.

08:24.407 --> 08:26.509
And this time, I would wager

08:26.593 --> 08:29.779
none of you will set him free again.

08:30.914 --> 08:32.214
The page.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.816
It's back in the loft.

08:33.884 --> 08:36.152
Mom, dad, Killian, watch Henry.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.004

go after the page, too.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.968
Better than ever.

08:53.019 --> 08:55.487
Why help me?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.674
You have the quill now.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.909
You don't need me anymore.

09:00.944 --> 09:02.544
We're a lot alike.

09:02.612 --> 09:05.481
We've both struggled mightily
for happiness all our lives.

You got power, became the Dark One,

09:07.717 --> 09:10.085

09:10.153 --> 09:12.187
I know what that's like...

09:12.255 --> 09:15.791
to always have
dissatisfaction gnawing at you,

09:15.842 --> 09:18.627
watching other people's happiness bloom.

09:18.695 --> 09:21.363
It's time for a world where up is down,

09:21.414 --> 09:24.800
where villains can have happy endings.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.902
And what does your ending look like?

09:28.004 --> 09:28.737
A castle?

and a 40-year life expectancy?

09:37.220 --> 09:38.614

09:38.681 --> 09:40.816

You're welcome to a

09:49.826 --> 09:50.692
Of course.

09:50.777 --> 09:52.894
I-I just need one last detail.

09:52.962 --> 09:54.996
Your son... Baelfire.

No.

10:05.792 --> 10:07.175
It can't.

10:07.243 --> 10:11.046
This quill and ink can only
change a past it has created.

10:11.114 --> 10:13.448
Which is why I have to write your new story

10:13.516 --> 10:15.984
from this moment forward
and into the future.

10:16.052 --> 10:18.403
But...

10:18.488 --> 10:20.789
In your new life, I
can make you forget him.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.658
No, never.

10:25.228 --> 10:27.562
I want my memories of him.

10:27.613 --> 10:32.300
But maybe with a... Slight adjustment.

10:34.270 --> 10:35.604
I would like a world

10:35.671 --> 10:41.977
where I remember doing right by my boy.

10:42.011 --> 10:49.084
Where he may be gone, but
I can live with that loss.

10:49.135 --> 10:55.423
Where Bae sees me as a
hero right at the end.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.093
I think I can do that.

10:59.462 --> 11:03.448
And with that last piece,
it's time to finish.

ask some of the others.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.297
<i>Yeah, I've got someone here.</i>

15:01.364 --> 15:03.282
<i>Yeah, I-I think he's a runaway.</i>

15:24.888 --> 15:26.088
Isaac: Thank you.

15:26.156 --> 15:28.090
[Cheers and applause] Thank you very much!

15:28.124 --> 15:29.391
[Cheers intensify]

15:29.426 --> 15:31.393
Please. Please, please.

15:31.444 --> 15:32.578
I-I-I'm
not worthy.

15:33.663 --> 15:35.848
[Laughs]

15:35.932 --> 15:38.317
[Cheers fade]

15:38.401 --> 15:39.702
Someone once told me

15:39.786 --> 15:42.671
I don't tell stories people want.

15:42.739 --> 15:44.356
[Laughter]

15:44.441 --> 15:47.376
But I say, write what
you're passionate about.

15:47.477 --> 15:48.761
That's what matters most.

15:54.217 --> 15:57.019
"Heroes and Villains" is close to my heart.

15:57.103 --> 15:58.854
It's been a passion project

15:58.922 --> 16:01.223
for longer than you would believe.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.724
I wrote it because I think

16:02.792 --> 16:05.194
folks are sick of heroes getting everything

16:05.261 --> 16:06.795
in these classic fairy tales.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.380
Hence, the radically different endings

16:08.464 --> 16:10.816
for Snow White, Prince
Charming, and all the rest...

16:10.900 --> 16:15.087
something different for a modern audience.

16:15.171 --> 16:19.107
What happens when villains win the day?

16:19.158 --> 16:20.542
[Applause]

16:20.577 --> 16:22.344
[Indistinct conversations]

16:26.783 --> 16:27.582
Thank you.

16:27.617 --> 16:30.269
Thank you.

16:30.353 --> 16:31.653
Long live Regina. [Chuckles]

16:31.688 --> 16:34.039
Please, can I give you a present...

16:34.123 --> 16:35.157
a little token of my love

16:35.241 --> 16:37.092
for the world that you've created?

16:38.895 --> 16:40.579
Regina... she's my favorite character.

16:40.663 --> 16:42.531
She's a real doozy, isn't she?

16:42.615 --> 16:44.382
Her life is just so unfair.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.635
Is she gonna get a happy
ending in the sequel?

16:46.719 --> 16:48.820
Please, you have to tell me.

16:48.905 --> 16:50.572
Sure. I can tell you.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.007
She...

16:52.074 --> 16:53.308
Sorry. No spoilers.

16:53.392 --> 16:54.743
You'll have to buy the next
book when it's finished.

16:54.777 --> 16:56.077
[Laughing] All right.

17:03.419 --> 17:04.469
What are you doing here?

17:04.554 --> 17:06.521
What did you do with my family?

17:06.556 --> 17:07.705
And where are they?

17:09.291 --> 17:10.291
I, uh... [Clears throat]

17:10.358 --> 17:11.726
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17:11.761 --> 17:13.060
Unh-unh. You're lying.

17:14.497 --> 17:16.196
Now, you know what this does,

17:16.248 --> 17:18.266
so you either give me some answers

17:18.334 --> 17:21.903
or I open this door again and
you get a whole new ending.

17:24.957 --> 17:26.040
Okay.

17:26.092 --> 17:27.709
Much to the chagrin of my publicist,

17:27.760 --> 17:29.778
you have my undivided attention.

17:29.812 --> 17:31.846
Where's my family?

17:31.914 --> 17:34.849
You really want to know?

17:34.884 --> 17:35.850
Look around you.

17:35.901 --> 17:38.069
They're all right there...

17:38.154 --> 17:39.788
in my best-selling book.

17:39.822 --> 17:41.840
What does that mean?

17:41.924 --> 17:42.841
Are they still alive?

17:42.925 --> 17:44.058
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.

17:44.093 --> 17:45.693
Easy with the key, cowboy.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.996
Your family is fine.

17:49.515 --> 17:51.799
If you want to get technical...

17:51.851 --> 17:53.318
They're in here.

17:53.402 --> 17:55.036
See?

17:55.070 --> 17:56.788
The original copy of my book...

17:56.872 --> 17:58.890
the one that I always wanted to write.

17:58.974 --> 18:02.827
They all live in here now in
kind of an alternate reality.

18:02.912 --> 18:04.128
You made them miserable.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.130
I see that you've read
some of my book. Good. Good.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.298
Then... then you know

18:07.383 --> 18:08.983
that everyone got the ending they deserve.

18:09.034 --> 18:11.035
Except Emma, of course.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.420
You won't find her in the book.

18:12.504 --> 18:15.356
There was no room for a savior in my world.

18:15.441 --> 18:17.542
Bring them back, or I use this.

18:17.626 --> 18:19.127
Ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.

18:19.161 --> 18:19.994
I can't.

18:20.079 --> 18:21.846
I don't have the power.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.815
The cardinal rule of The Authors is

18:23.899 --> 18:26.467
"don't write your own happy ending."

18:26.535 --> 18:28.836
As you can see [Inhales sharply]

18:28.921 --> 18:31.139
I broke that rule.

18:31.206 --> 18:34.659
So this... it's just a pen now.

18:34.743 --> 18:36.511
And me? Ohh.

18:36.545 --> 18:38.546
Well, I'm nothing more
than a best-selling writer

18:38.630 --> 18:39.764
with legions of fans

18:39.848 --> 18:41.816
and a penthouse over central park.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.084
If you can't get them out,

18:43.151 --> 18:44.547
then give me the book and I will.

18:45.754 --> 18:46.754
[Grunts]

18:46.838 --> 18:48.422
You?

18:48.473 --> 18:51.442
[Laughs]

18:51.527 --> 18:54.028
Do you know why you're still out here, kid?

18:54.079 --> 18:56.464
Because you're not from a magical world.

18:56.515 --> 18:57.765
So take it from me...

18:57.816 --> 19:00.401
you will never be a
knight in shining armor.

19:00.485 --> 19:02.903
You're just a poor, innocent
child who needs saving.

19:02.988 --> 19:04.705
So, why don't you put the key away

19:04.756 --> 19:07.508
and, uh, stick to the role you're best at?

19:13.632 --> 19:14.749
Now what?

19:16.551 --> 19:18.269
You're gonna tear up the book?

19:21.273 --> 19:22.656
Wait! Don't be stupid!

19:27.162 --> 19:28.162
Unh!

19:28.213 --> 19:29.663
[Coughs]

19:29.714 --> 19:31.632
[Birds chirping]

19:42.594 --> 19:43.510
[Gasps]

20:02.497 --> 20:03.864
[Grunts]

20:05.700 --> 20:07.701
Cool.

20:10.538 --> 20:12.289
Feel like a real hero now?

20:12.374 --> 20:13.674
Don't get used to it.

20:16.512 --> 20:18.394
[Breathing heavily]

20:19.181 --> 20:21.082
So, now we're both trapped in the book.

20:21.149 --> 20:22.149
Congratulations.

20:22.234 --> 20:23.651
Let me tell you about this place.

20:23.718 --> 20:25.469
It's cold, there's no running water,

20:25.554 --> 20:27.571
and things are always trying to kill you.

20:27.656 --> 20:28.923
Let me go!

20:28.957 --> 20:29.807
Not a chance.

20:29.891 --> 20:31.058
This book we're in,

20:31.126 --> 20:32.576
it's worked out quite nicely for me.

20:32.611 --> 20:34.528
I don't need you running
around changing things.

20:34.629 --> 20:35.596
<i>This is my story.</i>

20:36.533 --> 20:38.735
And no hero gets a happy ending.

20:38.802 --> 20:39.489
Why?

20:39.489 --> 20:41.523
Would that somehow destroy the book?

20:42.823 --> 20:44.090
That's what you're afraid of.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.059
Isn't it?

20:46.110 --> 20:48.962
Doesn't matter. You brought
us into the final chapter.

20:48.996 --> 20:49.963
How do you know?

20:50.047 --> 20:52.032
I know because I wrote it.

20:52.099 --> 20:53.366
And I know how it ends...

20:53.434 --> 20:55.802
with the loud tolling of bells at sunset.

20:55.870 --> 20:57.270
When you hear that sound,

20:57.305 --> 20:59.005
it'll mean we've reached the last page.

20:59.073 --> 21:00.373
The book will end,

21:00.408 --> 21:05.011
and everything will remain
exactly how I wrote it.

21:06.113 --> 21:08.381
[Creature roars, footsteps thud]

21:12.319 --> 21:14.037
There we are. Right on time.

21:14.121 --> 21:15.288
What is that?

21:15.373 --> 21:17.257
Oh, the inciting incident
of this chapter...

21:17.341 --> 21:18.391
an ogre attack.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.360
And you know what they say...

21:20.444 --> 21:22.128
you don't have to be faster than the ogre.

21:22.213 --> 21:24.497
You just have to be
faster than the next guy.

21:24.565 --> 21:26.282
- Wait!
- [Roaring]

21:34.375 --> 21:37.844
[Screeching]

21:37.928 --> 21:39.112
Help!

[Roars]

21:49.239 --> 21:50.123
[Horse whinnies]

22:01.268 --> 22:03.619
The monster is dead.

22:03.704 --> 22:06.823
The ogre slayer saved us!

22:06.907 --> 22:09.442
Thank you.

22:09.493 --> 22:13.679
If there's anything my family
and I can do to repay you...

22:13.764 --> 22:16.282
Good deeds have their own reward.

22:16.366 --> 22:18.084
This comes with no price.

22:23.824 --> 22:25.007
Are you all right, boy?

22:26.927 --> 22:28.110
What's your name?

22:29.229 --> 22:30.496
Uh, Henry.

22:30.581 --> 22:34.350
I am Rumplestiltskin, a
knight at your service.

22:34.434 --> 22:36.202
Do you have any family around here?

22:36.236 --> 22:38.204
Y-yeah.

22:38.288 --> 22:39.422
I think so.

22:39.506 --> 22:40.806
Yeah.

22:40.891 --> 22:43.609
Then I suggest you run
home for your supper, Henry,

22:43.677 --> 22:47.079
<i>because I... I have
another village to save.</i>

22:48.215 --> 22:50.015

Is anyone here?

<i>Turn around slowly.</i>

23:59.686 --> 24:01.119
Who are you?

24:01.204 --> 24:03.222
What do you want?

24:03.256 --> 24:05.941
My name's Henry.

24:06.025 --> 24:07.759
And I'm your son.

24:12.148 --> 24:13.315
Come on, Henry.

24:13.399 --> 24:14.566
Please be dead.

24:14.634 --> 24:15.751
Please be dead.

24:15.835 --> 24:17.002
Please be dead.

[Breathing shakily]

24:23.893 --> 24:24.977
[Groans]

24:25.011 --> 24:27.145
I should have remembered. I wrote the book.

24:27.213 --> 24:28.513
The ogre slayer.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.287
But I'm telling you...

24:35.321 --> 24:37.139
- that we're trapped inside a book?
- Yeah.

24:37.223 --> 24:40.025
[Laughing] And I'm supposed to
live in a place called Maine?

24:40.059 --> 24:41.827
Where I became your adopted mother

24:41.861 --> 24:44.262
after someone named Emma gave you up?

24:44.297 --> 24:45.347
Come on, mom.

24:45.431 --> 24:46.732
<i>You can remember.</i>

24:49.819 --> 24:52.003
Well, now that I think about it...

24:56.776 --> 25:00.929
This does make me wonder one thing.

25:04.784 --> 25:06.001
Who sent you?

25:06.085 --> 25:07.636
Mom, please. Nobody sent me.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.688
Stop calling me that!

25:09.772 --> 25:11.323
Are you working for the queen?

25:11.390 --> 25:12.874
No. I'm trying to help you.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.225
Help me what?

25:14.260 --> 25:16.194
Find your happy ending.

25:16.228 --> 25:20.382
In my world, we called
it "operation mongoose."

25:24.737 --> 25:26.755
[Laughs]

25:29.041 --> 25:31.609
That is a very silly name.

25:31.644 --> 25:33.611
<i>Well, it was your idea.</i>

25:33.662 --> 25:35.964
You actually believe this.

25:37.616 --> 25:38.900
So you're crazy.

25:38.984 --> 25:40.220
I'm not, and I can prove it.

25:41.537 --> 25:43.838
This is a copy of the
book we're trapped in.

25:43.923 --> 25:45.390
Let me see.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.214
[Laughs] This...

25:55.334 --> 25:59.604
This says I'm... Going to
rob a royal tax carriage today

25:59.655 --> 26:02.423
to buy passage out of the kingdom.

26:04.677 --> 26:06.611
How did the book know all that?

26:07.780 --> 26:09.414
It can see my future?

26:09.498 --> 26:10.682
Something like that.

26:10.716 --> 26:12.016
[Sighs]

26:12.051 --> 26:13.901
Then I don't want any part of it.

26:13.986 --> 26:14.919
No!

26:23.529 --> 26:24.395
[Scoffs]

26:24.480 --> 26:25.830

26:25.881 --> 26:28.833
Whatever world you think
you're from, go back there.

26:28.884 --> 26:31.335
I can't... not until you find true love.

26:31.386 --> 26:33.237
[Laughs] Then you're stuck.

26:33.272 --> 26:35.022
Never gonna happen for me.

26:36.492 --> 26:39.410
I-I think the only way
for us to escape this book

26:39.461 --> 26:41.913
is for you to find him
in a tavern and kiss him.

26:41.997 --> 26:44.165
True love's kiss... it can fix anything.

26:44.249 --> 26:45.800
[Laughs]

26:45.884 --> 26:46.767
Wow.

26:46.852 --> 26:48.736
<i>You are crazy.</i>

26:48.820 --> 26:50.738
If I ever meet Robin Hood in person,

26:50.822 --> 26:54.692
the only thing he gets is a broken nose.

26:56.028 --> 26:57.912
Wait... what are you talking about?

26:57.996 --> 26:59.530
He's my competition.

26:59.581 --> 27:01.866
Every robbery I plan, he beats me to it.

27:01.917 --> 27:04.285
He's the reason I'm stuck in this kingdom.

27:04.369 --> 27:06.337
Why am I still talking to you?

27:06.371 --> 27:07.588
'Cause I'm your son.

27:10.876 --> 27:12.209
Look, kid.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.345
If you read about me in that book,

27:14.379 --> 27:16.514
you know I got to go.

27:16.548 --> 27:17.798
The queen wants me dead.

27:17.883 --> 27:19.884
She thinks I ruined her life.

27:19.968 --> 27:20.768
Did you?

27:23.388 --> 27:24.555
Yes.

27:24.606 --> 27:28.559
So... If it's happy endings you're after,

27:28.610 --> 27:30.728
look someplace else.

27:38.597 --> 27:39.864
Henry!

27:41.450 --> 27:42.534
Where'd you go?

27:44.086 --> 27:46.504
Come on out! I can help you!

27:49.358 --> 27:51.492
[Gasping]

27:56.949 --> 27:58.783
[Grunts]

28:04.223 --> 28:05.373
Oh, no.

28:07.459 --> 28:09.811
Not these guys.

28:09.895 --> 28:12.497
[Laughs]

28:12.531 --> 28:15.133
Welcome to the queen's woods, trespasser.

28:15.217 --> 28:16.734
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

28:16.769 --> 28:18.569
Don't kill me!! No,
don't kill me!! No, no!!

28:18.654 --> 28:19.754
Unh!

28:19.838 --> 28:20.972
Search him.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.724
[Whimpers]

28:23.942 --> 28:25.043
No. No.

28:25.077 --> 28:26.344
No! [Gasps]

28:26.378 --> 28:30.064
Oh, goody. Look at this.

28:34.653 --> 28:36.404
"Long live Regina"?

28:37.840 --> 28:40.508
So, you're a trespasser and a traitor.

28:40.592 --> 28:41.726
That's not mine.

28:41.777 --> 28:43.327
Hi-ho, boys.

28:43.362 --> 28:45.630
It's off to work we go.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.934
[Wind whistling]

29:16.595 --> 29:17.445
You.

29:18.747 --> 29:20.464
Speak.

29:21.262 --> 29:23.813
We found him in the queen's
woods, your majesty...

29:23.898 --> 29:25.198
with this.

29:28.485 --> 29:30.403
"Long live Regina"?

29:30.454 --> 29:32.972
Not very likely.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.307
[Pin clatters]

29:34.391 --> 29:37.493
<i>Although, she'll certainly
live longer than you.</i>

29:37.578 --> 29:40.581
Now, what do we remove first?

29:40.581 --> 29:41.601
[Gasps]

29:41.829 --> 29:42.937
Your fingers?

29:44.149 --> 29:45.169
Or your ears?

29:45.169 --> 29:46.222
No removing. Please.

29:46.324 --> 29:47.908
I-I hate Regina as much as you do.

29:47.992 --> 29:49.593
<i>I'm on your side.</i>

29:49.644 --> 29:51.528
<i>Technically, you're at my feet.</i>

29:51.563 --> 29:53.030
We want the same thing...

29:53.081 --> 29:55.966
to keep everything in this
realm exactly how it is,

29:56.050 --> 29:57.267
with you in charge.

29:57.302 --> 29:58.852
A boy just arrived in this land.

29:58.937 --> 30:00.203
He fancies himself a hero.

30:00.238 --> 30:02.372
He wants to take away everything you have.

30:02.457 --> 30:04.591
Somebody has to stop him.

30:05.977 --> 30:08.278
Get in here!

30:08.363 --> 30:10.380
Finally... someone listens to me.

30:10.415 --> 30:11.298
[Door opens]

30:14.952 --> 30:18.121
No need to yell, snow.

30:18.206 --> 30:20.140
I will always find you.

30:20.224 --> 30:22.392
<i>I'm sorry... you will always find me, what?</i>

30:23.995 --> 30:27.013
I will always find you, your majesty.

30:27.098 --> 30:28.014
Mm!

30:28.099 --> 30:30.100
[Inhales deeply] That's better.

30:30.151 --> 30:32.753
Now, will you please
help me with something?

30:34.088 --> 30:35.939
Remove his head.

30:35.973 --> 30:38.108
Of course, your majesty.

30:38.192 --> 30:39.276
No, no, no! You don't understand!

30:39.360 --> 30:40.410
I can help you! I know things!

30:41.212 --> 30:42.679
I know who Snow White really loves!

30:48.002 --> 30:49.052
Ah. Aah.

30:49.086 --> 30:50.253
What did you say?

30:50.354 --> 30:52.639
You had a twin brother... James.

30:52.723 --> 30:55.325
He was the one who snow truly loved...

30:55.409 --> 30:56.710
before the tragedy.

30:56.794 --> 30:58.561
<i>Want me to kill him, your majesty?</i>

30:58.596 --> 31:00.063
Save you both the trouble?

31:00.147 --> 31:01.731
Let him speak.

31:01.782 --> 31:03.500
[Gasps]

31:05.336 --> 31:07.270
How do you know this?

31:08.556 --> 31:14.494
A magical book told me
everything about this land.

31:14.578 --> 31:17.263
James was cruel... like you.

31:19.984 --> 31:21.768
You understood each other.

31:21.852 --> 31:24.120
You fell in love.

31:24.171 --> 31:25.588
It was everything.

31:25.639 --> 31:28.508
But then, because of Regina, he died.

31:28.592 --> 31:32.495
So you took Charming's heart
and you forced him to be yours,

31:32.530 --> 31:35.615
but it never satisfied you.

31:35.699 --> 31:38.434
He's just a pale imitation of his brother.

31:38.469 --> 31:39.636
It's a sad story.

31:41.438 --> 31:44.290
But it can still have a happy ending.

31:45.409 --> 31:46.709
How?

31:46.760 --> 31:51.547
I know exactly where to find Regina.

31:51.599 --> 31:55.551
Revenge can be yours.

31:57.221 --> 32:01.024
And what is it that you want in return...

32:01.058 --> 32:03.109
aside from your life?

32:04.895 --> 32:08.064
The boy I told you about... Henry...

32:08.115 --> 32:10.399
He'll be trying to help Regina.

32:12.286 --> 32:14.620
I want you to kill them both.

32:19.626 --> 32:21.577

32:43.638 --> 32:44.771

32:44.805 --> 32:46.072
Surprised to see me?

32:46.824 --> 32:48.541
[Gasps]

32:48.626 --> 32:50.343
Charming, disarm her.

32:52.229 --> 32:53.880
Ohh!

32:53.948 --> 32:56.649
I've waited so long for this moment.

32:56.717 --> 33:00.420
Your head is going to look
lovely in my trophy room.

33:00.488 --> 33:01.504
Please, snow.

33:01.589 --> 33:03.656
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

33:03.691 --> 33:04.778
Once more...

33:05.335 --> 33:06.843
from your grave.

33:06.927 --> 33:09.312
I didn't know what would happen to James.

33:09.396 --> 33:11.881
I was a child. I was
only trying to help you.

33:11.966 --> 33:13.516
You broke a promise.

33:13.601 --> 33:16.703
Because of your poor, poor judgment,

33:16.787 --> 33:20.773
my true love is dead.

33:23.727 --> 33:27.113
Your majesty, before you rip her heart out,

33:27.164 --> 33:29.549
perhaps you should ask her about the boy.

33:31.518 --> 33:34.587
<i>So, you do have a brain
somewhere in that pretty head.</i>

33:36.740 --> 33:37.824
Where's the boy?

33:39.827 --> 33:42.645
Where... Is... He?

33:44.098 --> 33:46.065
When does this end, snow?

33:46.133 --> 33:49.535
This blood feud... when does it stop?

33:49.586 --> 33:53.105
When I've killed you and
every one of your followers.

33:54.208 --> 33:57.009
<i>You lost one happy ending.</i>

33:57.044 --> 33:58.811
And I'm sorry for that, but...

33:58.862 --> 34:02.515
All this killing will only
bring more hatred into your life,

34:02.583 --> 34:06.285
and all you'll be left with
is a hole in your heart...

34:06.336 --> 34:10.656
And no hope of ever finding true happiness.

34:12.109 --> 34:13.576
You...

34:15.429 --> 34:18.998
know nothing of my happiness.

Hyah!

34:35.632 --> 34:37.833
I had the situation under control.

34:37.918 --> 34:40.319
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

34:40.353 --> 34:41.737
Hyah!

34:41.822 --> 34:43.695
I told you I didn't need rescuing.

I'm already questioning
helping the competition.

Now hold still, please, milady.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.139

Because this may sting a little.

Now sit down before you pass out.

Well, thank you.

35:56.012 --> 35:57.729
I'll choose to take that as a compliment.

35:57.814 --> 36:00.198
Regina, while we may never have met,

36:00.283 --> 36:01.667
I always admired your skills.

36:03.469 --> 36:04.553

36:04.637 --> 36:06.538
I'm getting out of this game,

36:06.572 --> 36:08.707

36:08.758 --> 36:11.009
I'm in search of someone to take my place

Oh.

[Smacks lips] ...Can't accept.

36:22.872 --> 36:27.259
This forest isn't the place for me anymore.

Well, that's a shame.

36:29.095 --> 36:31.730
So, what's driving you out of the business?

36:31.814 --> 36:33.315
Have you ever met someone

36:33.399 --> 36:36.034
that you would change
your entire world for?

36:36.085 --> 36:38.286
Someone whose eyes

36:38.371 --> 36:42.507
you just knew you were born to gaze into?

36:45.378 --> 36:47.462
Uh...

36:47.547 --> 36:49.180
I have.

36:49.215 --> 36:51.549
And that's why I can't be a thief anymore.

36:51.634 --> 36:53.718
It wouldn't be fair to my new bride.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.975
Well, she will be when
we marry later today.

Hello, darling. [Chuckles]

37:02.061 --> 37:03.445
Mm. [Chuckles]

37:03.529 --> 37:05.697
So, who's this?

37:05.731 --> 37:07.732
Regina, I'd like you to meet my fiancée.

37:07.817 --> 37:09.401
This is Zelena.

37:09.485 --> 37:10.819
[Chuckles]

37:15.584 --> 37:18.641
I just can't believe I'm finally
meeting the bandit Regina.

37:19.503 --> 37:20.666
[Laughs]

37:22.408 --> 37:24.392
Thank you, but I should go.

37:24.427 --> 37:27.195
Oh, w-well, why don't
you stay for the ceremony?

37:27.246 --> 37:28.964
I mean, it'll be a simple affair, but...

37:29.015 --> 37:30.966
We'd love to have you
there, wouldn't we, darling?

37:32.168 --> 37:33.535
Of course.

37:33.603 --> 37:35.403
It would be our honor.

37:35.438 --> 37:37.072
O-oh, I...

37:37.123 --> 37:39.724
I should try to get a
head start on Snow White.

37:40.643 --> 37:43.018
I'm sure she has the entire
black guard looking for me.

37:49.619 --> 37:51.753
Thank you.

37:51.787 --> 37:53.488
For saving my life.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.228
Congratulations again.

38:01.414 --> 38:02.864
Both of you.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.670
So?

38:08.754 --> 38:09.637
[Giggles]

38:19.098 --> 38:21.015
Henry: Mom!

38:21.066 --> 38:22.917
You have to stop calling me that.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.919
How do you keep finding me, anyway?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.437
I figured if my plan worked,

38:26.522 --> 38:28.456
you'd be in Sherwood
forest with Robin Hood.

38:28.490 --> 38:29.624
I hate to break it to you,

38:29.708 --> 38:31.559
but Robin's already found his true love.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.696
And they're getting married...

38:34.763 --> 38:36.080
Today.

38:40.169 --> 38:42.470
No, no, no. T-this is all wrong.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.906
That's Zelena, your siste...

38:44.940 --> 38:47.241
Wait. You have to listen to me.

38:47.309 --> 38:49.210
[Scoffs] I heard enough.

38:49.261 --> 38:50.762
<i>I don't have a sister.</i>

38:50.846 --> 38:52.430
My mother abandoned me when I was a baby.

38:52.514 --> 38:54.332
<i>No, your mother abandoned Zelena.</i>

38:54.416 --> 38:56.884
Everything's flipped. This
must be Zelena's happy ending.

38:56.969 --> 38:58.886
Look, I have to go.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.339
And you should, too. Snow
white's looking for you.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.256
Wait.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.674
You can't tell me

39:03.759 --> 39:07.161
that you didn't feel anything
when you met Robin Hood.

39:08.897 --> 39:10.648
See? That's proof.

39:10.732 --> 39:12.166
He's your true love.

39:12.201 --> 39:13.334
No.

39:13.368 --> 39:15.336
It's proof that I'm not the kind of person

39:15.420 --> 39:16.521
that gets a happy ending.

39:22.644 --> 39:24.111
I'll never have true love.

39:26.348 --> 39:27.682
But you...

39:27.766 --> 39:29.984
you gave me the worst
thing you can give anyone.

39:31.253 --> 39:32.303
Hope.

39:32.387 --> 39:35.122
Now, I'd like to get far enough away

39:35.157 --> 39:36.457
that I don't have to hear

39:36.491 --> 39:38.426
Robin and Zelena's wedding
bells proclaim their love.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.277
Wait... did you say "wedding bells"?

39:40.362 --> 39:42.763
Yes. Now please let me be.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.565
The bells... from the end of the book.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.434
That's what he was talking about.

39:46.501 --> 39:48.235
Those bells... this wedding...

39:48.286 --> 39:50.137
it's our last chance to stop this

39:50.172 --> 39:51.772
from becoming real forever!

39:51.807 --> 39:53.908
<i>It already is real.</i>

39:53.959 --> 39:55.042
Not yet.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.812
We have to stop this wedding.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.247
Look...

40:00.282 --> 40:03.017
You seem like a nice boy.

40:03.051 --> 40:06.704
And clearly, you believe all this...

40:06.788 --> 40:08.489
Nonsense.

40:10.258 --> 40:12.493
But didn't you say I
was your adopted mother?

40:12.527 --> 40:16.764
That you have another mother
out there, named, uh...

40:16.798 --> 40:17.731
Emma?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.168
<i>So, if you want help, maybe
you should start by finding her.</i>

40:21.219 --> 40:22.503
I tried.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.904
She wasn't in the book.

40:23.938 --> 40:25.873
And if she were, believe me, you'd know.

40:25.907 --> 40:27.958
She's the most powerful sorceress there is.

40:28.043 --> 40:30.644
The only sorceress in
this land is Snow White.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.579
She's more powerful than her.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.381
She has, uh, special magic.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.216
Special magic?

40:36.284 --> 40:39.420
In our world, she was called "the savior."

40:41.439 --> 40:42.723
Never heard of her.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.442
Mom. No, I know that face.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.044
What aren't you telling me?

40:50.682 --> 40:53.033
[Sighs]

40:53.117 --> 40:54.401
There were rumors once

40:54.469 --> 40:56.603
of a woman who called herself that.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.840
The savior.

41:00.975 --> 41:02.576
Isaac lied.

41:02.644 --> 41:05.028
He couldn't write her out of the story.

41:05.113 --> 41:06.380
Where can I find her?

41:06.431 --> 41:08.348
You can't.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.603
Snow White locked her up years ago.

41:13.688 --> 41:18.992
No one has set eyes on her since.

41:19.043 --> 41:22.596
The prison she's in is impenetrable.

41:30.471 --> 41:32.572
[Gasping hysterically]

41:38.779 --> 41:40.947
[Screaming]

41:52.994 --> 41:54.794
[Horse whinnies]

41:58.683 --> 42:00.400
[Horse whinnies]

42:00.484 --> 42:01.618
Look!

42:01.702 --> 42:03.637
It's him!

42:03.671 --> 42:05.505
[All shouting excitedly]

42:08.609 --> 42:09.809
Belle!

42:09.877 --> 42:11.678
[Chuckles]

42:11.729 --> 42:12.979
[Baby coos]

42:13.064 --> 42:15.915
Sounds like someone else
wants to celebrate your return.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
[Chuckles]

42:19.687 --> 42:24.457
And how is the newest
member of our dear family?

42:24.508 --> 42:28.194
With any luck, he'll grow up
to be just like dear old dad.

42:28.279 --> 42:31.264
Belle. You didn't tell me we had a visitor.

42:31.348 --> 42:32.432
Name's Isaac.

42:32.516 --> 42:33.833
I was traveling through your village,

42:33.901 --> 42:36.035
when your wife invited
me in to slake my thirst.

42:36.103 --> 42:36.886
[Slurps]

42:38.022 --> 42:38.738
Mm.

42:38.823 --> 42:40.089
Not to be too picky,

42:40.174 --> 42:42.542
but the water tastes a little murky.

42:42.610 --> 42:45.745
Oh. I'll get some that's
fresh from the well.

42:45.829 --> 42:48.731
[Door opens, closes]

42:48.816 --> 42:51.784
You didn't come here for the water.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.304
Perceptive in all worlds.

42:54.388 --> 42:57.156
Good. Yes.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.292
I came here to warn you.

42:59.376 --> 43:01.594
Your happiness is in danger.

43:01.662 --> 43:02.528
From what?

43:02.596 --> 43:04.180
A boy.

43:04.264 --> 43:06.566
He's on a mission to
help the bandit Regina.

43:06.650 --> 43:10.186
If he succeeds, everything
you have will be destroyed.

43:11.655 --> 43:13.039
<i>Not to mention what I have.</i>

43:13.073 --> 43:14.841
Ha! What nonsense.

43:14.875 --> 43:17.477
How can some stranger's
actions affect my life?

43:17.561 --> 43:20.913
Because your happiness, your entire life...

43:20.981 --> 43:22.348
it's not real.

43:22.399 --> 43:25.651
I know because I am the one
who created it... with magic.

43:25.719 --> 43:27.887
And it is all about to crumble.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.239
Regina's true love is
about to marry another.

43:30.324 --> 43:33.559
She's going to try and stop the wedding.

43:33.644 --> 43:35.194
You cannot let her succeed.

43:36.580 --> 43:37.964
You have to kill her.

43:39.182 --> 43:42.418
Demon! You've been sent
here to try to corrupt me.

43:42.502 --> 43:44.804
You have already been corrupted.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.206
Before all of this, you were a villain...

43:47.257 --> 43:48.841
maybe the worst one of all.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.110
Which is why you had me use magic

43:51.194 --> 43:53.012
to rewrite your story.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.597
Look, I can prove it to you.

43:54.681 --> 43:56.382
I-I know things...

43:56.450 --> 43:58.651
the secrets that you've kept from Belle,

43:58.719 --> 44:02.922
the ones about your first son... Baelfire.

44:06.643 --> 44:08.711
Where did you hear that name?

44:08.795 --> 44:12.698
In this story, he was
killed in the ogre wars

44:12.782 --> 44:15.184
despite your heroic efforts.

44:15.268 --> 44:19.471
But in reality, he died
because of your cowardice.

44:19.539 --> 44:20.472
No, no, no.

44:20.540 --> 44:23.142
I... I protected him. I did my best.

44:23.210 --> 44:24.360
I...

44:26.780 --> 44:28.130
I was honorable.

44:28.215 --> 44:30.015
No.

44:30.066 --> 44:31.233
You weren't.

44:31.318 --> 44:32.868
He died because of you.

44:32.953 --> 44:33.719
Liar!

44:34.554 --> 44:36.906
<i>Get out of here... now.</i>

44:36.990 --> 44:38.824
All right. I'll go.

44:38.875 --> 44:41.727
But deep down, you know I'm right.

44:41.811 --> 44:43.829
You're not really a hero.

44:43.863 --> 44:45.130
And if you don't kill Regina

44:45.165 --> 44:46.665
and keep her from her happy ending,

44:46.716 --> 44:50.402
then everyone, including
Belle, will know, too.

44:55.325 --> 44:58.510
I know you'll make the
right choice, Rumple.

44:58.578 --> 45:00.145
You always do.

45:07.904 --> 45:09.655
Ahoy!

45:12.475 --> 45:13.475
Is anyone here?!

45:13.560 --> 45:15.060
Careful, boy.

45:15.145 --> 45:17.162
<i>No one steps aboard the jolly Roger's decks</i>

45:17.230 --> 45:19.631
without an invitation
from its captain first.

45:19.716 --> 45:22.184
Are you gonna make me walk the plank?

45:22.268 --> 45:23.952
All depends on why you're here.

45:24.037 --> 45:26.505
I need a ship to take
me to the bottomless sea.

45:26.556 --> 45:29.157
Now, those are treacherous waters.

45:29.242 --> 45:31.276
There must be something
of great value there

45:31.344 --> 45:32.711
to be worth taking the risk.

45:32.762 --> 45:34.179
"Someone."

45:34.263 --> 45:36.748
Her name is Emma. She's my mom.

45:36.816 --> 45:38.750
And she was put there by the queen.

45:38.801 --> 45:41.303
Well, then, I'm sorry for you.

45:41.387 --> 45:43.155
Even if I wanted to, I can't help you.

45:44.540 --> 45:46.058
Why? You're a captain.

45:46.125 --> 45:48.727
Can't you take your ship wherever you want?

45:48.811 --> 45:50.078
[Laughs]

45:50.163 --> 45:52.397
A captain?

45:52.465 --> 45:54.182
Is that who he says he is?

45:54.267 --> 45:55.434
I thought I told you

45:55.518 --> 45:57.919
to be done swabbing
the decks when I return.

45:58.004 --> 45:59.971
I'm sorry, captain black beard.

46:00.006 --> 46:01.506
<i>Wait... he's the captain?</i>

46:01.557 --> 46:02.774
Indeed.

46:02.859 --> 46:06.094
Unless deckhand Hook wants
to keep playing pretend.

46:07.597 --> 46:09.614
What do you say, Hook?

46:09.665 --> 46:13.051
<i>Beat me, and the jolly Roger is yours.</i>

46:13.102 --> 46:16.621
Or are you still a one-handed coward?

46:18.541 --> 46:20.642
What are you doing?! Stand up to him!

46:20.726 --> 46:21.776
<i>You can beat him.</i>

46:21.861 --> 46:23.495
I'm afraid you don't know me very well.

46:23.529 --> 46:25.246
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

46:25.331 --> 46:26.965
[Scrubbing]

46:27.850 --> 46:29.651
<i>Then I'll have to help you.</i>

46:30.703 --> 46:31.586
Ugh!

46:33.472 --> 46:34.806
What the bloody hell are you doing?!

46:34.857 --> 46:36.808
Getting you your ship back.

46:36.876 --> 46:38.743
Come on. Let's dump black beard and go.

46:38.811 --> 46:40.178
You think it's that easy?

46:40.229 --> 46:41.479
<i>I can't sail the jolly Roger alone.</i>

46:41.564 --> 46:42.564
I can help.

46:42.648 --> 46:43.948
How do you know how to sail a ship?

46:44.033 --> 46:46.968
I had a great teacher... you.

46:57.947 --> 46:59.364
Look!

47:07.122 --> 47:08.456
We found it!

47:08.541 --> 47:10.675
There's a black knight standing guard.

47:10.726 --> 47:12.143
Only one.

47:12.227 --> 47:13.311
We can take him out.

47:13.395 --> 47:14.646
Well, you perhaps you hadn't noticed,

47:14.697 --> 47:16.447
but I'm a deckhand, not a soldier.

47:18.534 --> 47:20.852
<i>Then maybe we don't need to fight.</i>

business for the queen,

47:34.099 --> 47:36.451
from the kingdom of Kashyyyk.

47:49.565 --> 47:51.782
Never mind.

47:51.817 --> 47:53.701
Lock the guard in the cell.

47:53.785 --> 47:55.753
I'll be back with my mom as soon as I can.

Henry.

48:22.814 --> 48:25.316
You... you remember.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.035
I knew you'd find me.

48:34.551 --> 48:35.734
I don't understand.

48:35.819 --> 48:38.087
How do you remember when no one else does?

48:38.155 --> 48:39.889
Must have been part of Gold's plan.

48:40.790 --> 48:42.858
My punishment in this world
is that I know the truth

48:42.943 --> 48:44.710
but I'm powerless to do anything about it.

48:44.794 --> 48:46.962
In this world, I'm no longer the savior.

48:47.030 --> 48:47.980
I've got no magic.

48:48.064 --> 48:49.248
That's all right.

48:49.332 --> 48:51.300
I think I know what to do.

49:08.852 --> 49:10.185
Yeah. Right.

49:10.270 --> 49:12.154
Look, we need to... Get going.

I'm pleased you regained
your, uh, your freedom.

49:22.816 --> 49:23.782
Me too.

49:23.867 --> 49:25.701
Unfortunately, it's not gonna last

49:25.785 --> 49:28.337
unless we put some distance between that
tower and us before the guard wakes up.

49:32.258 --> 49:33.509
Why?

49:33.560 --> 49:37.045
Because that was not any
ordinary black knight.

49:37.080 --> 49:40.432
Her name is Lily.

49:40.516 --> 49:42.150
She's dangerous.

49:42.235 --> 49:44.419
I don't understand. What's
the problem with Lily?

49:45.722 --> 49:46.588

Henry, get below now!

cannon with a chain shot.

Cheers.

50:38.407 --> 50:39.791
You did it.

50:39.876 --> 50:40.909
<i>We did it.</i>

50:43.679 --> 50:44.579
What is that?

It's goat's milk.

50:46.048 --> 50:48.183
[Scoffs] Where's your rum?

50:48.217 --> 50:50.518
I'm allergic. Never touch the stuff.

50:50.569 --> 50:51.720
Of course you are.

50:51.787 --> 50:53.471
Can I ask you a?

50:53.556 --> 50:55.807
You trusted me with
your life just now. Why?

50:57.059 --> 50:58.326
It's complicated.

50:58.411 --> 51:00.495
Might take a while.

51:00.563 --> 51:03.615
My schedule's pretty clear.

51:03.699 --> 51:05.633
Okay.

51:05.701 --> 51:07.685
Let's first work on your fighting skills.

51:07.770 --> 51:11.406
Then we've got to help
Regina stop that wedding.

51:21.283 --> 51:22.867
Where is Regina's heart?

51:26.255 --> 51:27.438
No one?

51:29.024 --> 51:30.792
And what of the child?

51:30.843 --> 51:32.977
Surely you imbeciles
aren't all stupid enough

51:33.062 --> 51:34.562
to report back here empty-handed.

51:34.613 --> 51:37.398
<i>Actually, your majesty,
they are exactly that stupid.</i>

51:37.466 --> 51:38.600
We would have caught the bandit

51:38.634 --> 51:40.068
if Blue and her gaggle of uglies

51:40.102 --> 51:41.736
hadn't laid a trap of dark fairy dust,

51:41.804 --> 51:43.037
paralyzing our axes.

51:43.122 --> 51:44.339
Always blaming the fairies.

51:44.423 --> 51:45.473
Maybe you should try

51:45.557 --> 51:46.941
and take responsibility for once, dwarf.

51:46.992 --> 51:49.377
You mangy, flea-infested
wolf. I should get a muzzle...

51:49.428 --> 51:50.511
silence.

51:51.980 --> 51:53.381
We aren't here to fight.

51:54.700 --> 51:55.983
We're a team.

51:56.051 --> 51:58.019
So you're not... Mad?

51:58.070 --> 51:59.854
Of course not.

52:01.590 --> 52:03.424
It's not your fault.

52:03.509 --> 52:05.977
<i>It's mine.</i>

52:06.061 --> 52:08.246
You see, I am your leader,

52:08.330 --> 52:10.848
and I have to lead by example.

52:10.933 --> 52:16.120
We have to go to extreme
lengths to succeed.

52:16.205 --> 52:17.538
And to do that...

52:21.193 --> 52:22.994
I have to show you how.

52:24.713 --> 52:27.949
I have to motivate you.

52:27.983 --> 52:29.333
[Squish] [Gasps]

52:30.419 --> 52:31.085
Aah!

52:32.354 --> 52:34.355
[Crumbling]

52:37.926 --> 52:39.810
Well, now you're down to six.

52:40.979 --> 52:43.030
Do you want to make it five?

52:44.332 --> 52:47.635
Find Regina and the boy and kill them.

52:49.988 --> 52:51.572
[Chair creaks]

52:54.860 --> 52:57.411
[Indistinct conversations in distance]

52:57.446 --> 53:00.881
You're telling me that...
In this other reality,

53:00.949 --> 53:03.450
I'm an expert with such a weapon?

53:03.502 --> 53:05.386
You're a regular Jack sparrow.

53:05.420 --> 53:07.054
Is that good?

53:07.105 --> 53:08.722
Here. Let me show you how to use it.

53:08.807 --> 53:10.658
[Laughs]

53:10.742 --> 53:12.960
Oh. [Chuckles]

53:14.513 --> 53:16.463
They say once you become an expert,

53:16.531 --> 53:18.165
your subconscious takes over.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.617
Ah.

53:19.701 --> 53:22.152
Back in my world, that's
what we call muscle memory.

53:26.841 --> 53:30.311
Tell me more about this
reality you want to return to.

53:30.395 --> 53:32.713
Us, for example.

53:32.781 --> 53:35.582
I sense that we, uh... we may be close.

53:35.667 --> 53:36.684
[Chuckles]

53:36.751 --> 53:37.851
Very.

53:37.902 --> 53:39.486
Really? [Chuckles]

53:39.571 --> 53:43.457
Well, I'm starting to get
jealous of the other me.

53:43.541 --> 53:45.175
Let's see what food Henry's discovered.

53:45.260 --> 53:47.561
I'm starving.

53:47.645 --> 53:48.996
There they are.

53:50.999 --> 53:52.583
It's as I told you, my queen.

53:52.667 --> 53:54.685
The one-handed pirate was helping them.

53:54.769 --> 53:57.154
And the boy was with them, as well.

53:58.540 --> 53:59.890
Tell us where the child is hiding!

53:59.974 --> 54:02.276
Hey! Back off, dwarf!

54:02.310 --> 54:04.294
Or they'll change your name to "stumpy"!

54:04.379 --> 54:05.545
I know you.

54:06.931 --> 54:08.432
You're...

54:08.516 --> 54:09.950
Emma.

54:10.018 --> 54:11.735
The mad hag who was locked in the tower.

54:11.819 --> 54:14.171
I almost didn't recognize
you out of your chains.

54:14.255 --> 54:16.506
You're the one that's hard
to recognize... both of you.

54:16.591 --> 54:17.808
This isn't who you are.

54:18.977 --> 54:21.828
Tell me... who are we?

54:21.913 --> 54:23.964
You're my parents.

54:25.433 --> 54:27.617
I'm the product of your true love.

54:27.702 --> 54:29.653
You taught me how to be a hero,

54:29.737 --> 54:31.972
you taught me how to believe in hope.

54:32.006 --> 54:34.174
And I do.

54:34.242 --> 54:37.210
<i>And now I need you to believe in it, too.</i>

54:41.516 --> 54:42.816
You're right.

54:44.452 --> 54:45.785
Emma.

54:47.305 --> 54:51.024
Hope is a very powerful thing.

54:51.075 --> 54:52.993
Which is why I'm going to
have to snuff it out of you

54:53.027 --> 54:54.961
and that awful son of yours.

54:55.012 --> 54:56.229
Kill them.

54:56.264 --> 54:57.030
Charming: Wait!

54:58.649 --> 54:59.950
There he is.

55:01.869 --> 55:03.637
My, my.

55:03.721 --> 55:06.656
<i>I am going to enjoy watching
him die in front of his mother.</i>

55:08.492 --> 55:09.609
Save Henry.

55:09.677 --> 55:11.211
Killian, you can't beat them.

55:11.262 --> 55:13.930
If I can help return things
to how they were meant to be,

55:14.015 --> 55:16.066
then what happens to me
here won't matter, will it?

55:16.951 --> 55:18.451
Now go. Save your boy.

55:27.661 --> 55:29.462
Is she worth your life, pirate?

55:29.547 --> 55:32.148
I'm willing to find out.

55:34.568 --> 55:35.585
[grunts]

55:37.671 --> 55:39.172
[Whimpering, gasping]

55:44.612 --> 55:46.079
[Breathing heavily]

55:53.437 --> 55:55.905
What do you know? I'm a natural.

55:57.224 --> 55:59.075
Hey!

56:01.962 --> 56:04.130
What about you, your majesty?

56:04.164 --> 56:06.165
Shall I make quick work...

56:06.250 --> 56:07.000
no!

56:07.084 --> 56:08.501
[Gasps]

56:08.585 --> 56:10.553
I never did like pirates.

56:11.755 --> 56:13.256
Mom!

56:14.558 --> 56:16.259
[Sword plunges]

56:19.179 --> 56:20.813
We have to get out of here! Mom!

56:24.518 --> 56:26.152
[Whimpers]

56:28.756 --> 56:29.789
[Gasps]

56:40.752 --> 56:42.438
[Baby cooing]

56:50.071 --> 56:51.844
[Door opens]

56:55.121 --> 56:57.039
What... what's wrong?

56:59.726 --> 57:02.444
I've just learned...

57:02.529 --> 57:06.598
Of a threat to our realm.

57:06.683 --> 57:10.085
If left unchecked...

57:10.170 --> 57:13.572
It'll destroy all that
we've built together.

57:14.874 --> 57:16.675
All our happiness.

57:16.743 --> 57:19.495
But you're the Light One.

57:19.579 --> 57:22.397
Whatever this force is, you'll overcome it.

57:22.482 --> 57:24.416
It's more complicated than that.

57:24.484 --> 57:26.118
Eliminating this threat

57:26.185 --> 57:29.021
means I have to make a difficult choice.

57:29.055 --> 57:30.989
And if I make the wrong one...

57:31.074 --> 57:34.426
but... You won't.

57:34.477 --> 57:36.361
You never do.

57:36.446 --> 57:39.665
You're a hero, Rumple.

57:39.732 --> 57:42.034
Yeah, but what if I'm not?

57:46.472 --> 57:47.723
Here.

57:47.807 --> 57:50.409
Things never seem quite as
bleak after a cup of tea.

57:56.032 --> 57:57.416
Belle, I'm so sorry.

57:57.450 --> 57:59.551
It's all right.

57:59.635 --> 58:00.602
It's fine.

58:00.686 --> 58:02.704
See? It's just chipped.

58:02.789 --> 58:05.357
We can fix it.

58:07.426 --> 58:10.162
I'm not so sure it's as simple as that.

58:14.133 --> 58:15.217
[Hurried footsteps]

58:15.301 --> 58:16.017
Henry: Mom!

58:16.102 --> 58:17.102
[Gasps, sighs]

58:17.153 --> 58:18.920
I knew you'd still be here.

58:19.005 --> 58:20.121
You again?

58:20.206 --> 58:22.390
Listen, I-I don't have time for stories.

58:22.475 --> 58:24.776
I need to hit the road before
the Evil Queen has my head.

58:24.810 --> 58:26.578
Wait. I brought someone else this time.

58:27.597 --> 58:29.731
<i>Maybe you'll listen to her.</i>

58:29.815 --> 58:31.216
[Breathlessly] Regina.

58:31.284 --> 58:33.118
Let me guess...

58:33.169 --> 58:34.452
you're his other mother.

58:34.537 --> 58:35.971
Emma.

58:36.055 --> 58:37.556
I have to give you credit.

58:37.607 --> 58:39.958
Breaking her out of that
tower couldn't have been easy.

58:39.992 --> 58:41.793
Henry, can you give us a minute?

58:41.827 --> 58:42.594
Sure.

58:44.330 --> 58:47.282
You know, your son can use some reining in.

58:47.366 --> 58:49.334
He's been running around the forest,

58:49.385 --> 58:50.969
getting into trouble, spouting nonsense.

58:51.020 --> 58:52.904
Regina, everything he
said about this reality...

58:52.938 --> 58:53.938
it's all true.

58:54.006 --> 58:55.507
[Scoffs] I doubt that.

58:55.558 --> 58:57.442
I don't know why I'm wasting my time

58:57.476 --> 59:01.296
with a madwoman who...
Calls herself the savior.

59:01.380 --> 59:02.931
Because I can help.

59:03.015 --> 59:04.549
Your happiness is still a possibility.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.484
Your first step is going
after the man you love.

59:06.569 --> 59:08.419
My happy ending isn't a man.

59:08.454 --> 59:09.721
Of course not.

59:09.788 --> 59:12.740
But love is a part of all happiness,

59:12.825 --> 59:14.459
and you have to be open to that.

59:14.543 --> 59:15.760
Go to Robin Hood.

59:15.794 --> 59:17.729
All you have to do is
tell him how you feel.

59:17.813 --> 59:19.030
Oh, is that all?

59:19.081 --> 59:20.164
You forgot to mention the part

59:20.232 --> 59:21.849
where I'd have to crash his wedding.

59:21.934 --> 59:23.101
What does your heart tell you?

59:23.185 --> 59:25.670
I know what my heart says.

59:26.955 --> 59:29.674
But what if his doesn't say the same thing?

59:29.742 --> 59:32.744
Isn't that a risk you're willing to take?

59:35.047 --> 59:38.282
I just watched the man I love die.

59:39.985 --> 59:41.486
I'm... I'm sorry.

59:41.553 --> 59:42.804
That's horrible.

59:42.888 --> 59:47.158
The worst part is that I
never told him I loved him.

59:47.192 --> 59:48.543
Not once.

59:50.045 --> 59:51.429
I was too scared.

59:51.480 --> 59:54.699
Too scared that...

59:54.783 --> 59:59.020
Somehow, saying it would make it real...

59:59.104 --> 01:00:01.072
And change everything.

01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:06.010
But now I'll never have a chance
to take that next step with him,

01:00:06.094 --> 01:00:07.695
because he's gone.

01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:13.918
My only chance with him

01:00:14.002 --> 01:00:16.854
is if you don't make
the same mistake I did.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.000
[Indistinct conversations,
slow music plays]

01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:37.441

01:00:40.812 --> 01:00:43.714
[All panting]

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.149
We haven't heard the wedding bells yet.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.234
There's still time.

01:00:58.163 --> 01:01:00.865
I don't even know what to say to him.

01:01:00.916 --> 01:01:03.284
I think, in this case, actions
speak louder than words.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.169
Once you and Robin share true love's kiss,

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.037
everything should be great again.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.423
Okay.

01:01:11.092 --> 01:01:12.676
What?

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.631
You don't remember this,
but I promised you once

01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:17.115
I'd help you find your happy ending.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.018
Just glad I'm here to see it.

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.586
You got this, Regina.

01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:26.640
I'm afraid none of you are
crashing this wedding...

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:28.142
Dearies.

01:01:34.402 --> 01:01:36.069
Go. I got the Dark One.

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.372
"Dark One"?

01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:40.774
I'm afraid you have the wrong name, dearie.

01:01:42.443 --> 01:01:44.244
We'll see about that.

01:01:44.312 --> 01:01:45.379
Regina, go!

01:01:51.769 --> 01:01:53.653

01:01:58.292 --> 01:01:59.659
Do you, Zelena, take Robin

And do you, Robin, take Zelena

01:02:28.122 --> 01:02:30.123
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:47.640
Go! You have to stop that wedding!

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:42.410
Still locked up, still pregnant.

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:47.065
But that's something
we'll be able to deal with.

01:15:48.534 --> 01:15:49.801
Together.

01:15:50.556 --> 01:15:53.741
So, Will is looking after Roland.

01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:57.178
Perhaps I could take you
for a walk in the moonlight?

[Chuckles]

01:15:59.281 --> 01:16:00.581

Though, to be fair, I didn't have a heart.

01:16:10.326 --> 01:16:12.927
What I think he means to say is...

01:16:12.962 --> 01:16:14.862
We are sory.

01:16:14.897 --> 01:16:16.314
Eh, you don't need to be sorry.

01:16:16.398 --> 01:16:18.332
Although I do intend to
hold it over your heads

01:16:18.383 --> 01:16:19.584
for a very long time.

01:16:19.668 --> 01:16:21.068
I think we both know what
happened in that world

01:16:21.103 --> 01:16:22.403
was not real.

01:16:22.454 --> 01:16:26.307
Although, seeing you guys as
real villains made me sorry

01:16:26.358 --> 01:16:29.794

Hey.

01:16:38.103 --> 01:16:40.922
What's up? Something wrong?

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.358
Do you remember this?

01:16:44.443 --> 01:16:45.493
Yeah.

01:16:45.527 --> 01:16:46.661
I nearly got hepatitis stealing it back

01:16:46.695 --> 01:16:48.629
from your boyfriend's rat-infested place.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.399
It's a piece of the egg I was hatched from.

01:16:51.483 --> 01:16:54.802
It's also the only clue I
have as to who my father is.

Have you asked your mother?

What?

01:16:58.707 --> 01:17:00.675
It's a dragon thing.

01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:03.327
You know, it... Happened in dragon form.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:07.565
Do you want to find him?

We're pulling the darkness
from him and containing it.

Does that mean that his
heart will be healed?

01:17:40.715 --> 01:17:43.550
Perhaps... if the strength is there.

01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:45.119
This is more dark power

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:48.138

been asked to contain.

He tethered it to a human soul
