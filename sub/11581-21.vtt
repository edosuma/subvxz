NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.337 --> 00:06.607
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.776
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.809 --> 00:10.778
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.811 --> 00:12.313
are members of an elite squad

00:12.346 --> 00:14.148
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.650
These are their stories.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.488
This apartment's
not scheduled
till 1:00.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.356
We get in trouble,
I'm blaming you.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.459
We clean the place early,
we go home early.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.428
Lady's gonna be pissed
if she walks in

00:27.461 --> 00:28.796
and we scare
the crap out of her.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.231
That's the beauty of it.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.432
The lady got a new job.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.734
She'll be gone all day.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.636
How do you know?

00:35.669 --> 00:38.106
Janey cleaned
this apartment last week.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.242
Ew! This bathroom
is disgusting.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.210
No wonder.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.812
That lazy bitch
always does a half-assed job.

00:44.845 --> 00:45.813
Oh, my God!

00:45.846 --> 00:47.181
What?

00:47.215 --> 00:48.582
Oh, my God!
What?

00:48.616 --> 00:49.683
Oh, she's dead!

00:49.717 --> 00:50.651
She's dead!

00:50.684 --> 00:52.753
Call the cops.
Get an ambulance right now!

00:52.786 --> 00:54.855
Ma'am? Ma'am?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.624
Lady? Lady?

00:56.657 --> 00:58.659
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you hear me?

00:58.692 --> 00:59.727
Ma'am?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.263
She's not breathing!

01:02.296 --> 01:04.265
Lady, come on,
wake up.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.501
Ma'am?

01:07.535 --> 01:09.203
WOMAN:
Name's Christina Nerrit.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.106
Unconscious,
but EMS said she was breathing

01:12.140 --> 01:13.707
on her own the whole way in.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.109
We know what made
her unconscious?

01:15.143 --> 01:16.877
Cleaning woman
found her handcuffed

01:16.910 --> 01:19.113
with a plastic bag
taped over her head.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.881
We don't know how long
she was deprived of oxygen.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.750
We're doing an EEG
to assess brain activity.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.751
Rape kit?

01:23.784 --> 01:26.354
Negative for hairs
and fluids.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.590
And the paramedics say her hair
was soaked when they found her.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.359
As soon as I know more,
I'll call you.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.726
Victim was wet.
( pager beeping )

01:32.760 --> 01:34.328
Perp must have tried
to clean her up.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.697
So much for trace evidence.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.099
M.E.'s office. Urgent.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.403
Crime Scene sent urine
samples from the toilet

01:42.436 --> 01:43.537
in the victim's bathroom.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.206
Even you can't get DNA
back that fast.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.675
No, but I ran
other tests.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.843
Urine's got high levels
of creatinine

01:49.877 --> 01:51.545
and blood urea nitrogen.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.813
Both by-products
of protein.

01:52.846 --> 01:53.947
What does that mean?

01:53.981 --> 01:58.519
Your victim or your perp
is dying of kidney failure.

02:02.756 --> 02:07.228
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:50.238 --> 02:50.804
Neighbor down the hall said

02:51.605 --> 02:52.506
the victim was
some kind of artist.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.441
How did you guys do?

02:53.474 --> 02:54.808
Middle of the day,
hardly anyone around.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.344
The maids didn't
hear or see squat.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.511
And unfortunately,
this building

02:57.545 --> 02:58.712
doesn't have
security cameras.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.515
So all we've got is a perp
that may have kidney failure.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.518
The urine I sent to the M.E.
came from two spots I found

03:04.552 --> 03:05.786
on the rim of the bowl.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.488
What makes you so sure
it's the perps?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.789
The victim's a woman
living alone.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.823
The toilet seat was up.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.824
Some guys never learn.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.527
Soap's wet, so your theory
that the perp made her

03:13.561 --> 03:15.296
take a shower
holds water.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.331
I'll check the drain
for hairs.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.333
The only thing that doesn't
make sense is the bed.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.401
What about it?

03:20.434 --> 03:22.370
Guy goes to all this trouble
to cover his tracks,

03:22.403 --> 03:24.672
leaves his sheets. Why?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.540
Cash and credit cards
are still in her wallet,

03:26.574 --> 03:27.908
along with this receipt
from this morning.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.443
Restaurant at
the Hotel Kennedy.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
70 bucks. Had to be at least
two people eating.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.415
So, Christina
buys him breakfast,

03:34.448 --> 03:36.450
he rapes her for lunch.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.255
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember her.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.523
Breakfast rush. Table ten.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.458
She with anyone?

03:44.492 --> 03:45.426
Uh, some suit.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.828
You know, custom shirt,
hundred-dollar tie.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.698
Wish I'd had the balls
to spill something on it.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.400
Bad tipper?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.001
Guy takes one bite
of his potatoes,

03:54.034 --> 03:56.937
spits them out and starts
screaming, he told me no salt.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.339
He had a health problem.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.773
Yeah, or a mental problem.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.609
I mean, I write
everything down.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.776
He never said no salt.

04:02.810 --> 04:03.844
Remember
anything else?

04:03.877 --> 04:07.281
Woman seemed a little PMS,
mood-wise.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.450
I bring out the coffee,
she's all happy and smiley.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.784
When I come back
with the entrÃ©es,

04:10.818 --> 04:11.785
she's bawling
like a baby.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.920
About what?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.855
I don't stand around
eavesdropping.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.057
You didn't happen to hear
the guy's name either?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.627
No. You know, but I can
get it for you.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.961
It's not gonna be there.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.296
She paid for breakfast.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.632
Yeah, but he had a bar tab.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.802
Couple Bloody Mary's
while he was waiting for her.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.971
Yeah, that's it.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
Guy named Brooks Harmon.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.976
Corporate credit card,
Blossner House Publishing.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.980
I just hired Christina
as Director of Medical
Illustration.

04:40.013 --> 04:40.914
Will she be okay?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.750
We're waiting to hear
from the hospital.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.817
I had a feeling
something was wrong

04:43.851 --> 04:45.886
when she didn't show up
for the 11:00 staff meeting.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.888
I tried her cell phone,
but it went right
to voice mail.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.458
Did Christina tell you
where she was going
after breakfast?

04:50.491 --> 04:51.392
Home to pick up
a few things.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.993
And then she was coming
right back here.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.294
Anything bothering her?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.864
Not that I know of.
We were celebrating
her new position.

04:56.897 --> 04:57.865
BENSON:
Really?

04:57.898 --> 04:59.833
'Cause we heard she was crying.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.669
Christina is our best
freelance illustrator.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.736
She has no management
experience;

05:02.770 --> 05:05.005
she was anxious about being able
to handle the job.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.940
Do you have a problem handling
salt, Mr. Harmon?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.842
No. I just don't like
the whole shaker

05:08.876 --> 05:10.310
being poured over my breakfast.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.879
( phone ringing )
What does it have
to do with Christina?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.915
Can you tell us where you
went after the restaurant?
Straight back to the office.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.350
You didn't answer my question.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.317
You were the last person

05:17.351 --> 05:19.787
seen with Christina
before she was attacked.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.821
That makes me a suspect?

05:20.854 --> 05:23.624
Not if you don't mind
letting our medical examiner

05:23.657 --> 05:26.627
take some blood for a DNA sample
to rule you out.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.795
No problem.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
When?

05:28.862 --> 05:31.632
Tomorrow. We'll set it
up and give you a call.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
Any time is fine.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.503
Thanks for the help.
Mm-hmm.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.905
That was Cragen. He wants us
to recanvass all the tenants

05:37.938 --> 05:39.740
who weren't there
when we got there.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.709
What, Munch and Fin
taking a personal day?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.911
They're at the hospital.
Christina's awake.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.682
I was opening the door
to my apartment

05:48.716 --> 05:51.151
when he came up behind me,
said he had a gun.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.687
Told me not to scream.

05:53.721 --> 05:57.124
FIN:
After you got inside,
what did he do?

05:57.157 --> 06:01.094
He made me take off my clothes
and lie in bed.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.764
He said he'd kill me
if I looked at him.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.798
Then he...

06:06.500 --> 06:07.835
( sighs )

06:10.037 --> 06:14.642
...cuffed me to the headboard
and... raped me.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.843
What happened next?

06:18.178 --> 06:20.080
He put the bag over my head.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.082
Thank God the maids found me.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.051
Were you ever able
to get a look at him?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.119
No. I was too scared.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.425
Oh.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.093
Christina...

06:36.664 --> 06:38.198
Oh!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.768
My sister, Allison.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.103
These men are police detectives.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.973
Here's your laptop, but...

06:46.006 --> 06:47.708
I wish you would
just get some rest.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.810
Working will help me forget
what happened.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.480
MUNCH:
We can give you the names
of some counselors.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.147
I'm not talking to any shrinks!

06:56.550 --> 06:57.985
I'm sorry.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.987
I didn't mean to snap like that.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.590
I-I... You're
just trying to help.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.992
( sighs )

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
Couple of big holes
in her story.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.529
Christina gets home at 10:00,
the maids find her at 11:30.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.998
That means she and the perp were
alone for an hour and a half.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.700
It's a long time not
to get a look at him.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.701
Doesn't mean
she made it up.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.169
This might.
She didn't mention
taking a shower.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.538
Rapist makes
you clean up,

07:17.571 --> 07:19.106
Now, that's a hard
thing to forget.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.140
Not to mention the fact,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.142
just happens to sneak out
in the nick of time.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.877
Couldn't have had more
than six minutes

07:23.911 --> 07:25.145
after he put the bag
on her head

07:25.178 --> 07:26.514
or Christina
would've asphyxiated.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.681
Anything from the
second canvass?

07:27.715 --> 07:30.050
Just that this is the only way
in or out of that building.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.686
So, either no one wants
to fess up letting a stranger in

07:32.720 --> 07:34.221
or they really didn't see him.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.089
Maybe candid camera did.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.659
Store's got one pointing
this way.

07:39.993 --> 07:40.994
I cued it back to

07:41.028 --> 07:44.064
just before 10:00
like you said, zoomed it in.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.969
STABLER:
Christina. Right on time.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.104
BENSON:
Nobody followed her in.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.574
Fast-forward it to 11:30.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.608
I don't have to.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.843
I already
dubbed the tape.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.514
BENSON:
Hold it. Look at that.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.381
Brooks Harmon.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.017
He rapes her,
but he used a condom.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.053
That's why
he gave us the DNA.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.557
BENSON:
So you went in
at ten after 11:00,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.692
and you left at 11:30.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.661
STABLER:
What were you doing there,
Brooks?

08:13.694 --> 08:15.128
I wanted to make sure
she was okay.

08:15.162 --> 08:15.929
Why wouldn't she be?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.998
Because she never
came back to work.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.234
I knocked on her
apartment door.
No answer.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.402
So you stayed for 20 minutes?

08:22.435 --> 08:25.305
At the same time she just
happened to be suffocating?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.506
I swear, I had nothing
to do with it.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.142
You called your office to cancel
your 11:00 staff meeting.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.279
Now, that sounds to me
like you had someplace to go.

08:32.312 --> 08:37.284
Brooks, I'm going to
tell you what I think.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.152
You tried to kill Christina

08:39.186 --> 08:43.924
so your wife wouldn't find out
you were banging her. Hmm.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.193
( sharp exhale )

08:46.226 --> 08:48.228
Okay.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.866
We were having an affair.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.134
So why didn't you
just tell us that?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.036
I was trying to
end it at breakfast.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.605
That's why
Christina was crying.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.640
Are you sure that it wasn't
because you told her

08:59.673 --> 09:00.974
that you wanted to tie her up?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.175
What are you talking about?

09:02.209 --> 09:04.144
We found your handcuffs,
Brooks.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.312
I don't do that.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.014
Toilet seat was up.
You do that?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.181
What the hell
does that mean?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.717
It means you sprinkled
when you tinkled.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.953
Our medical examiner tested
the urine you left behind.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.287
You're dying
of kidney failure.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.288
That's impossible.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.159
I just... I just
had a physical.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.694
I am in perfect health.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.695
( knock at door )

09:21.729 --> 09:22.495
( door opening )

09:22.529 --> 09:24.865
Mr. Harmon,
I'm Captain Cragen.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.234
There's been a misunderstanding.
You're free to go.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.335
I can leave?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.303
With our apologies.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.341
You people are nuts.

09:37.845 --> 09:38.646
Captain...

09:38.679 --> 09:40.280
Warner thinks
it's somebody else.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.016
I sent Munch and Fin to see her.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.054
I found cervical cells
in the urine.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.156
Whoever used the toilet
is female.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.257
And it's not Christina.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.992
If her kidneys were failing,
it would have shown up

09:52.025 --> 09:53.293
in her blood work from the ER.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.696
Christina's labs
all came back normal.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.731
So the person with her
was a woman.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.932
Christina's a bisexual?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.234
Harmon knocks on her door,
she doesn't answer

10:01.268 --> 10:02.970
'cause she's
with her girlfriend.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.104
She makes Christina
take a shower,

10:04.137 --> 10:07.174
she cuffs her to the bed
and tapes a bag over her head.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.876
But instead of having sex,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.944
bitch leaves Christina
to suffocate.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.781
So why's Christina crying rape
to protect her?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.317
I don't want
to talk about it.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.052
She tried to kill you.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.387
It was, it was an accident.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.755
Doesn't look that way.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.291
Did she threaten you
not to talk?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.292
No.

10:25.325 --> 10:30.230
Look, I'm not here
to judge you, believe me.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.866
But no matter how much
you love this woman,

10:32.900 --> 10:35.235
she doesn't deserve
your loyalty.

10:35.268 --> 10:39.272
What happened in my apartment
was-was not a crime.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.742
Falsely reporting
a rape is.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.743
I'm really tired.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.344
I-I'd like to go back
to my room.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.447
I need you to tell me
what really happened.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.682
Don't worry about me.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.683
Are you all right?

10:49.717 --> 10:53.253
Yes, I'm okay now.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.755
Whoa! Whoa!
I need some help in here!

10:54.788 --> 10:56.924
I need some help now!

10:56.957 --> 10:57.925
Help!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.359
Bring the cart!

11:01.895 --> 11:03.296
( gagging )

11:10.904 --> 11:11.504
Medical examiner's
on the way.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.742
We're treating Ms. Nerrit's
death as suspicious.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.909
What happened to her?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.778
Severe hypoglycemic shock.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.780
Her blood sugar crashed.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.381
Our doctors did a finger stick

11:21.414 --> 11:23.283
while they were trying
to resuscitate her.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.484
She had a glucose
level of two.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.986
That sounds low.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.287
Oh, yeah.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.355
Normal's around 90.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.860
So, I ran some tests on
blood drawn during the code.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.496
Ms. Nerrit's insulin level
was five times normal.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.365
Are you saying
she was murdered?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.801
I can't say anything
officially yet, of course,

11:40.834 --> 11:42.069
but someone injected
Ms. Nerrit

11:42.102 --> 11:43.771
with a massive dose
of insulin.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.872
When?

11:44.905 --> 11:50.077
No more than 15, 20 minutes
before seizures began.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.112
Hospital pharmacy went
through their inventory.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.814
All their insulin
is accounted for.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.448
So someone brought it in
from the outside.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.484
Christina have any visitors
besides her sister?

11:57.517 --> 11:58.685
Staff didn't notice anyone.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.854
The perp could've
been dressed like
they work here.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.922
Or the real deal.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.791
Psycho doc or killer nurse,
like the guy in Jersey,

12:03.824 --> 12:04.925
gets off watching people die.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.060
Either one would have
access to insulin.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.528
You'd better be sure
about this.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.297
Hospital pathologist said

12:10.330 --> 12:12.432
Christina was
definitely injected.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.768
I get stuck with a needle
and die,

12:14.802 --> 12:17.304
my husband and kids get
both your pensions.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.039
Now we just have to find
the right syringe.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.040
How're we going to know?

12:20.073 --> 12:20.841
That's the easy part.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.177
Hospitals order one brand
in bulk.

12:24.211 --> 12:28.782
This one... is different
from the others.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.786
Hospital confirms it never
used that brand of syringe.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.989
The lab found prints on
the cylinder and plunger
and traces of insulin.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.224
Injected how?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.526
No needle punctures
in Christina's body,

12:39.559 --> 12:41.829
so had to be through
the port in her IV.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.865
Young, otherwise healthy,
about to be discharged.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.000
Angel of mercy usually likes
them old and sick.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.536
Hospital hasn't had any
suspicious deaths in years,

12:49.569 --> 12:51.939
but we're checking personnel
files just in case.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.907
Could be our mystery
woman didn't want

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
to risk Christina
ratting her out.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.510
Christina's sister Allison
was the last person

12:57.544 --> 12:58.611
seen in the hospital room.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.881
The sister have any reason
to want Christina dead?

13:00.914 --> 13:02.049
Christina may have
killed herself.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.050
Where did you get that?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.384
Computer Crimes.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.320
They found something
very interesting on her laptop.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.122
Gentlemen, your so-called victim

13:09.156 --> 13:10.958
has been doing
a little blogging.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.894
That's daily, almost
hourly trips to one Web site.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.863
"Catching-the-train-dot-com."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.397
Catching the train where?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.832
Apparently, to the afterlife.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.500
It's a bunch of people
talking about suicide.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.169
Listen to this.
"Welcome to the station.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.871
"The train's pulling in.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.338
Click here for your ticket

13:25.372 --> 13:26.473
to everlasting peace."

13:26.506 --> 13:27.474
Can you believe that?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.043
Christina Nerrit's handle
on this site was C-U.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.178
As in "later."

13:31.211 --> 13:32.379
Who was she writing to?

13:32.412 --> 13:35.115
MAN:
Mostly someone with
the screen name "Conductor."

13:35.148 --> 13:36.383
That's why she
was so hot

13:36.416 --> 13:37.985
for her laptop
at the hospital.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.953
She wanted to chat
with these whackos.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.322
Christina started a thread
the day you found her.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.456
Titled it "Still Here."

13:43.490 --> 13:45.292
"Christina:
'Missed the train today.'"

13:45.325 --> 13:47.294
"Conductor:
'What happened?'"

13:47.327 --> 13:50.363
"Christina:
'Maids came early and found me.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.333
Ripped the bag off.
I'm in the hospital.'"

13:53.366 --> 13:54.367
"Conductor:...

13:54.401 --> 13:55.468
'What..."
'What now?'"

13:55.502 --> 13:57.204
"Christina: 'Something quick

13:57.237 --> 13:59.206
before anyone figures it out.'"

13:59.239 --> 14:01.641
"Conductor:
'Hospitals have insulin.'"

14:01.674 --> 14:04.144
STABLER:
First time Christina tries
to off herself, she lives.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.013
She made sure
that wouldn't happen again.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.015
CRAGEN:
We've got plenty of cases
with living victims.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.117
We got to move on
if this was a suicide.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.885
MUNCH:
Assisted suicide, Captain.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.653
That's second degree
manslaughter.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.555
Maybe Christina's
mystery girlfriend

14:15.588 --> 14:17.524
with kidney failure
is our Conductor.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.527
We can ID her off her ISP.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.363
I found where Christina
ordered her insulin.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.966
Online prescription mill.
Staten Island.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.300
( door slams open )

14:27.334 --> 14:30.203
Police! Stand up, step away
from your computers

14:30.237 --> 14:31.671
and do not touch anything.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.907
I'm Marvin Friedman,
Chairman and CEO.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.143
You can all wait outside
till our lawyers arrive.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.078
This is a search warrant
signed by a federal judge,

14:38.111 --> 14:40.213
allowing us to look for evidence
your company dispenses

14:40.247 --> 14:41.481
medication without
prescriptions.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.482
Everything we do here

14:42.515 --> 14:43.483
is legal.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.284
FIN:
How did this woman

14:44.317 --> 14:46.253
buy insulin from you
to kill herself?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.155
Oh, she probably lied
on the questionnaire.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.057
Our doctors won't send
anything out

14:50.090 --> 14:52.492
to anyone unless they've
signed their medical records.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.494
Right, and I'm sure
you decline any order

14:54.527 --> 14:56.396
that's may be unnecessary
or dangerous.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.065
I don't have to answer that.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.033
I bet these so-called
doctors will

15:00.067 --> 15:02.402
once we threaten to take
their licenses.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.670
What do you want from me?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.505
Check when that
order went out.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.240
It went out overnight
two days ago.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.977
You keep all these invoices
in your head?

15:10.010 --> 15:11.111
She called me.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.280
Frantic because I won't ship it
to a post-office box.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.015
Where did she have
the insulin sent?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.483
Her home address.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.953
I'm packing up
Christina's things.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.688
I guess I'll give
most of it away.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.023
What are you looking for?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.391
Any packages that came

15:24.424 --> 15:26.960
after Christina went
into the hospital?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.261
Just this.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.332
You know what's in it?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.367
I think it's insulin.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.436
Christina wasn't diabetic.

15:36.469 --> 15:40.373
Allison, we think your sister
used insulin to kill herself.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.210
No, that can't be.
It's right here.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.678
She couldn't get it,
so someone got it for her.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.247
If Christina
committed suicide,

15:47.280 --> 15:49.082
then why are
the police interested?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.450
Because someone
helped her

15:50.483 --> 15:51.684
and that's a crime.

15:51.718 --> 15:55.022
Do any of Christina's friends
have keys to the apartment?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.456
Christina didn't
have any friends.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.193
Allison, I need to know
where you were yesterday.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.362
You think it was me?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.264
I have to ask.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.233
You were the last one
seen with her in the hospital

16:06.266 --> 16:07.234
before she died.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.101
I loved her.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.103
I would never help
her kill herself.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.371
FIN:
Sorry to interrupt.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.607
That's okay.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.009
We're done.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.710
I'd like to finish packing.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.982
Computer Crimes
found our Conductor.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.088
FIN:
Dr. Amy Solwey?

16:28.121 --> 16:30.190
WOMAN:
Just a second.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.293
These men

16:33.326 --> 16:35.128
are police officers.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.196
Can you help us
out here?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.697
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.099
We need to talk to you

16:39.132 --> 16:40.500
in private.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.303
My assistant
can translate.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.805
FIN:
Well, this is
official business.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.807
We'll call an interpreter
down to our precinct.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.078
Fine. Just give me a moment.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.516
Should we call you Dr. Solwey
or Conductor?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.218
Conductor on the Internet.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.087
In person, my name is Amy.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.555
So, Amy, how do you know
Christina Nerrit?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.191
I'm sorry, I don't.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.827
How about C-U from the
catching-the-train Web site?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.529
That's my site.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.164
I know the name.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.266
Did you help Christina Nerrit
kill herself?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.635
I gave her advice.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.270
FIN:
Bad advice.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.506
She didn't think so.
She was in pain.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.608
And suicide was the cure?

17:21.641 --> 17:24.211
What kind of doctor are you?

17:24.244 --> 17:26.113
Ph.D. I'm an embryologist.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.082
FIN:
So you help women get pregnant

17:29.116 --> 17:31.518
and in your spare time, you tell
them how to kill themselves.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.153
By telling them exactly
how to do it.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.854
"If you're using cyanide,
mix it with water

17:34.887 --> 17:36.389
"and test the pH.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.791
"Make sure it's
not too acidic or alkaline

17:38.825 --> 17:40.593
so it doesn't burn
going down."

17:40.627 --> 17:43.130
Your Web site is like
"Suicide for Dummies."

17:46.133 --> 17:47.867
My Web site also prevents people

17:47.900 --> 17:49.736
from killing
themselves.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.140
But it's just talk.
You know, free speech.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.176
Where were you
two days ago, Amy?

17:56.209 --> 17:57.510
Around lunchtime?

17:57.544 --> 17:58.778
I was at work.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.381
Ask my assistant.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.117
You don't seem too upset
about Christina's death.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.486
I'm not.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.221
She's happy now.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.158
I'm sure she called to thank you
right after she died.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.726
Christina didn't commit
a crime and neither did I.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.396
Now, if that's all,
I've got to get back to work.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.530
Thank you.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.199
An officer will drive you.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.371
She's lying.
How you know that?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.572
Her coat-- it's Burberry.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.573
I've seen it before.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.640
Where?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.778
Benson:
There.

18:31.811 --> 18:32.912
You can't seen her face,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.215
but that's Amy Solwey leaving
Christina's building.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.883
Two minutes after
Christina's boss.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.151
He was banging on the door
for 15 minutes.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.920
Amy must've waited until after
he left so he wouldn't see her.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.490
Probably helped to put on
the cuffs and the bag.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.825
The urine on the toilet
belongs to a woman.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.160
It's got to be Amy's.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.295
How do you know that?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.197
She's probably got
Alport's syndrome.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.431
It's a rare genetic disorder

18:51.464 --> 18:53.433
that causes deafness
and kidney failure.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.901
Is that enough
to collar her?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.936
I'd like to connect her
to the insulin first.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.671
She works in a doctor's office.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.440
Not all doctors keep
insulin around.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.941
Hers would.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.411
It's a fertility clinic
and OB/GYN.

19:04.444 --> 19:08.315
They need it for pregnant women
with gestational diabetes.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.484
The insulin is stored upstairs.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.520
We have no use for it down here.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.855
The warrant covers
the entire office.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.291
Please... you're
literally holding

19:18.325 --> 19:20.327
potential lives in your hands.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.195
You must know
what that's like.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.330
I got the insulin.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.597
Where did you find it?

19:24.631 --> 19:25.832
Desk in her office.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.267
Amy Solwey, you are under arrest

19:27.300 --> 19:28.401
for assisting a suicide.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.237
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.471
If you give up that right,

19:31.504 --> 19:34.274
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

19:40.380 --> 19:40.913
MAN:
Man two is a stretch.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.516
You're wrong about my client.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.917
Any advice Amy gave
to Christina Nerrit

19:44.951 --> 19:47.354
regarding suicide is protected
by the First Amendment.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.888
As deplorable as I find
her Web site,

19:48.921 --> 19:51.658
if all she did was exercise her
right to free speech,

19:51.691 --> 19:52.659
we wouldn't be here.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.760
We can explain

19:53.793 --> 19:56.229
those insulin vials
in her office.

19:56.263 --> 19:59.899
After they give birth, our
gestational diabetes patients

19:59.932 --> 20:02.802
sometimes bring their
leftover insulin back
to the office.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.571
Last week a woman
gave me hers.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.639
Dr. Solwey got busy,
put them in her desk

20:06.673 --> 20:07.607
and forgot about them.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.475
Honest mistake.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.677
MUNCH:
Nice try, but the syringe used

20:10.710 --> 20:12.612
to inject Christina
is the same brand used

20:12.645 --> 20:13.546
in your client's office.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.548
And thousands
of other doctor's offices,

20:15.582 --> 20:16.616
clinics and hospitals.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.651
We have her on tape leaving
Christina's building

20:18.685 --> 20:20.653
just before she was found.
That a coincidence, too?

20:20.687 --> 20:21.854
Christina called me.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.790
Asked me if I could come over.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.325
I met her in the hallway.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.459
She told me her plans.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.660
I tried to talk
her out of it.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.830
Really? Doesn't that go against
your whole belief system?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.467
You can't possibly understand.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.368
MUNCH:
You're right.
We don't.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.836
Why are we debating this?

20:36.869 --> 20:40.340
Nobody saw Amy enter Christina's
apartment or hospital room.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.409
She's innocent,
give us blood for DNA.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.980
Dr. Huang's right on the money.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.782
Amy Solwey has
Alport's syndrome.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.683
Woman's a scientist.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.286
She's got to know
we had something on her.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.321
Why agree to a blood test?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.923
Probably because she thought
she could fool us

20:56.956 --> 20:58.625
by giving right after dialysis.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.427
But her kidneys are
in such bad shape

21:00.460 --> 21:01.428
the dialysis only helped
a little.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.529
( phone ringing )

21:02.562 --> 21:04.364
There's
something else.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.398
Tutuola.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.566
Amy's blood has higher

21:06.599 --> 21:07.900
than normal levels of calcium

21:07.934 --> 21:09.101
and parathyroid hormone.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.372
I think she has a condition
called renal osteodystrophy.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.373
What's that?

21:13.406 --> 21:14.441
A disorder
that causes

21:14.474 --> 21:17.444
severe bone deterioration
and eventually death.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.978
Almost always seen in people

21:19.011 --> 21:21.681
who've been on dialysis
at least five years.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.617
So what's keeping her alive
is also killing her.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.618
Slowly
and painfully.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.621
She's in so much excruciating,
constant pain

21:28.655 --> 21:30.823
that she might consider suicide.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.593
Crime lab says the print
on the syringe plunger

21:33.626 --> 21:34.594
is Christina's.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.063
MUNCH:
So that means Christina
injected herself

21:37.096 --> 21:38.998
with insulin.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.501
And Amy Solwey definitely
brought it to her.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.403
Her print's the one
on the cylinder.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.574
CLERK:
Docket ending four-one-four,

21:47.607 --> 21:49.409
People v. Amy Solwey.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.579
One count, manslaughter
in the second degree.

21:52.612 --> 21:56.115
I see you've hired
a new attorney, Ms. Solwey.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.584
Barry Moredock
for the defense, Your Honor.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.718
How does your
client plead?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.390
Not Guilty.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.024
Bail, Ms. Novak?

22:05.057 --> 22:07.627
Can we approach?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.432
The People believe
Ms. Solwey is a
suicide risk.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.566
Based on what?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.968
The pain caused by
her debilitating
bone disease.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.537
So you want
to keep an eye on her?

22:17.570 --> 22:18.605
For her own
protection.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.906
That's unfair, Your Honor.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.874
What my client needs
is continued access

22:21.908 --> 22:23.543
to her dialysis
three days a week.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.479
Which she'll have in the prison
ward of Bellevue Hospital,

22:26.513 --> 22:29.081
along with three squares a day
and indoor plumbing.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.483
Step back.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.519
Defendant is remanded
without bail.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.454
( gavel bangs )

22:34.487 --> 22:36.623
MOREDOCK:
Ms. Novak.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.491
I believe in
the constitution.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.959
I'll bet you do, too.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.561
You're reaching,
Mr. Moredock.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.463
This case is about murder,
not free speech.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.465
I disagree. So
does my client.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.467
Your client handed
Christina Nerrit the weapon

22:47.500 --> 22:48.801
she killed herself with.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.637
She didn't force
Christina to use it.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.505
The law doesn't make
that distinction.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.140
The law in this
case is the problem,

22:54.173 --> 22:58.511
not what Amy Solwey did.

22:59.512 --> 23:02.649
Your client's not a violent,
cold-blooded killer.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.651
We may be open to a deal.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.153
Oh, we're not interested
in a deal, Ms. Novak.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.489
Amy wants
her day in court.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.658
She does, or you do?

23:11.691 --> 23:15.495
I represent my client's
interests, not my own.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.664
Well, then talk to her.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.533
Don't let her spend
what time she has
left in prison.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.768
You've already
locked her up,

23:21.801 --> 23:23.002
and for no good reason.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.672
I'm sorry. I can't
take the chance you're wrong.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.841
Then let your
Dr. Huang evaluate her.

23:28.875 --> 23:33.412
He'll tell you Amy's no more
suicidal than you or I.

23:35.548 --> 23:39.652
HUANG:
You have Alport's syndrome,

23:39.686 --> 23:41.120
so you've been deaf
since you were born.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.689
Was it hard
growing up like that way?

23:42.722 --> 23:44.657
No. My father was deaf,

23:44.691 --> 23:47.527
so I've never known
anything else.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.196
Even the kidney failure
didn't bother me

23:50.229 --> 23:52.599
because I knew it was coming.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.468
What I wasn't ready for
was the pain.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.870
Are you on the list for
a kidney transplant?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.872
Yeah.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.875
But they haven't found
a match for me yet.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.479
The pain is what made me
first think about suicide.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.815
Did you talk
to a therapist?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.717
Three.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.585
They put me on
antidepressants,

24:12.619 --> 24:14.787
but I told them
that didn't
change the fact

24:14.821 --> 24:16.723
that I was dying
of kidney failure,

24:16.756 --> 24:18.658
so I stopped seeing them.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.926
And yet, you're still here,

24:19.959 --> 24:21.994
so you must've found
some way to cope.

24:23.029 --> 24:26.065
I started a blog.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.801
People responded.

24:28.835 --> 24:31.838
Turned into my own little
community of support.

24:31.871 --> 24:35.141
Is that how
catchingthetrain.com started?

24:35.174 --> 24:38.611
Yes.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.647
One day, someone wrote

24:40.680 --> 24:44.751
that she wanted
to kill herself.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.754
She was suffering mentally,
not physically.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.256
What did you tell her?

24:50.289 --> 24:52.258
To get help.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.527
That she should be thankful

24:54.561 --> 24:57.096
that she wasn't dying.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.298
She wrote back, and asked me

24:59.331 --> 25:02.268
who was I to assume
that her suffering

25:02.301 --> 25:06.305
couldn't be as bad
or worse than mine.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.641
Well, how did that
make you feel?

25:08.675 --> 25:10.777
I realized
that I was judging her

25:10.810 --> 25:13.646
just like the
shrinks judged me.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.114
So I wrote back,

25:15.147 --> 25:17.650
and I told her she was right...

25:17.684 --> 25:18.718
that I supported her choice.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.788
But you did more than that
with Christina Nerrit.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.623
You helped her die.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.125
She could have been helped
to want to live.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.160
You believe that suicide's wrong

25:28.194 --> 25:30.663
because it's your job
to save people.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.998
Medicine and psychiatry

25:32.031 --> 25:34.967
are about how to improve
the quality of life,

25:35.001 --> 25:36.803
not how to end it.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.340
Antidepressants and therapy
never worked for me.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.676
I still think about
suicide every day.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.546
But something keeps
you from doing it.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.819
Those people on the Internet,

25:52.852 --> 25:56.288
who'd help them if I'm gone?

25:58.324 --> 26:01.127
The irony is that her Web site
gives her a reason to live.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.995
Playing god with people's lives.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.764
She's like Kevorkian.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.699
Come on, Munch, all the
stuff you whine about,

26:06.733 --> 26:09.669
don't tell me you haven't once
thought about hanging it up.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.738
I believe life's worth living.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.805
Amen.

26:12.839 --> 26:13.740
BENSON:
I don't know.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.007
If I had something
like Huntington's disease,

26:15.041 --> 26:17.877
and all I had to look forward to
was a long and horrible death,

26:17.910 --> 26:19.746
I can't say
I wouldn't think about suicide.

26:19.779 --> 26:23.315
Moredock going to try and stack
the jury with people like you.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.719
He's going to put the assisted
suicide statute on trial.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.688
Jury nullifies,
precedent's set.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.056
Then the law
can be ignored.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.191
Which is exactly
what Amy wants--

26:32.224 --> 26:34.293
the right to take
our own lives.

26:38.030 --> 26:42.001
HUANG:
Amy Solwey isn't depressed
or mentally ill,

26:42.034 --> 26:43.770
but she is
in constant pain,

26:43.803 --> 26:46.873
and she deals with this
by spreading the message

26:46.906 --> 26:48.808
that suicide is our right.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.244
NOVAK:
As a psychiatrist,
how would you assess that view?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.246
Mainstream medicine
and psychiatry wouldn't agree.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.816
But Amy wouldn't have
a reason to live

26:56.849 --> 26:58.918
if she didn't help people die.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.386
What about Christina Nerrit?

27:00.419 --> 27:01.587
Was she depressed?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.423
Based upon interviews
I did with her family
and coworkers,

27:04.456 --> 27:05.725
I'd say yes.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.060
Was her disorder
treatable?

27:08.094 --> 27:10.029
With therapy, medication
and hard work,

27:10.062 --> 27:13.232
Christina probably could have
led a full, happy life.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.901
Thank you, Doctor.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.039
What if Christina didn't want
to go through your therapy,

27:20.072 --> 27:22.742
had told you she had a
plan to take her own life?

27:22.775 --> 27:24.243
What would you
have done?

27:24.276 --> 27:27.814
Checked her into a psychiatric
facility on a 72-hour hold.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.682
You would deprive her
of her liberty

27:29.716 --> 27:31.751
despite the fact
that suicide's not illegal?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.252
The intention
isn't to imprison her.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.355
It's to protect her
from herself.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.191
98%
of all successful suicides

27:39.225 --> 27:41.928
are committed by people
with a treatable mental illness.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.296
And you can cure all of them,
isn't that right?

27:44.330 --> 27:45.765
I said treatable.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.700
Not all are curable.

27:47.734 --> 27:52.304
Then sometimes your medication
and therapy just don't work.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.340
In severe cases, yes.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.442
The truth is, Doctor,

27:56.475 --> 28:00.346
you can't sit there and say
that there's no such thing

28:00.379 --> 28:03.115
as a terminal mental illness,
can you?

28:05.151 --> 28:07.787
No.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.822
Christina called me.

28:09.856 --> 28:10.890
She was happy.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.458
Said it was time.

28:12.491 --> 28:16.195
I went to her apartment
to give her moral support.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.130
She told me she was
using the plastic bag

28:18.164 --> 28:20.299
and the handcuffs so
she couldn't rip it off.

28:20.332 --> 28:23.035
What did you do?

28:23.069 --> 28:27.339
Wished her a safe
journey and left.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.508
What happened
in the hospital?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.243
Christina called again.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.446
Told me she couldn't
find any insulin,

28:34.480 --> 28:37.216
and asked me
to bring her some.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.120
I filled a syringe
and took it to her.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.455
Amy,
did you, at any time, coerce

28:43.489 --> 28:47.059
or convince Christina Nerrit
to take her own life?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.861
No.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.263
It was her decision.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.502
You're sure about that?

28:56.535 --> 28:58.004
Yes.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.172
The day
she tried to suffocate herself,

29:00.206 --> 29:01.841
did Christina tell you
that the man

29:01.874 --> 29:04.276
that she'd had an affair with
had just dumped her?

29:04.310 --> 29:05.978
I didn't ask.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.280
Did you ever consider

29:08.314 --> 29:11.450
that she might be under strain
and not thinking rationally?

29:11.483 --> 29:13.853
We didn't talk
about her boyfriend.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.055
Of course not. I mean, you
couldn't assess her mental state

29:16.088 --> 29:18.357
because you're not a trained
mental health professional.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.892
Objection.
Argumentative.
Withdrawn.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.160
Do you have criteria?

29:21.193 --> 29:22.161
For what?

29:22.194 --> 29:25.932
Whom you choose to help
on their final journey.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.266
I mean, has it only been adults?

29:27.299 --> 29:28.500
Or have there been teenagers,

29:28.534 --> 29:30.136
children,
the developmentally disabled?

29:30.169 --> 29:31.370
This is badgering,
Your Honor.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.941
I help people who don't
want to suffer anymore.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.909
Well, the truth is, you don't
know who they are, do you?

29:36.943 --> 29:37.977
They're just names
on a computer screen.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.345
Stop!

29:41.547 --> 29:42.514
They're in pain!

29:42.548 --> 29:44.216
I know what pain is!

29:44.250 --> 29:45.885
I live with it every day!

29:45.918 --> 29:48.054
You don't!

29:48.087 --> 29:50.222
How can you judge me?!

29:50.256 --> 29:53.159
How can you judge them?!

30:05.171 --> 30:07.239
This case
isn't just about Amy Solwey

30:07.273 --> 30:09.408
helping Christina Nerrit
kill herself.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.410
Time and again,
the highest court in the land

30:11.443 --> 30:13.479
has ruled our government
can't tell us

30:13.512 --> 30:14.847
what to do with our bodies.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.449
Why should suicide
be any different?

30:17.483 --> 30:19.518
Ms. Novak will tell you

30:19.551 --> 30:21.387
it's your duty
to uphold the law.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.522
But if you convict Amy Solwey,

30:23.555 --> 30:26.325
you're sending a message
that the government

30:26.358 --> 30:30.562
can dictate how we live our
lives and how we end them.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.431
Our constitutional rights

30:32.464 --> 30:36.002
to privacy and free speech
are at stake.

30:36.035 --> 30:39.271
Return a verdict
of not guilty.

30:39.305 --> 30:43.409
Send the message
that Amy Solwey is right--

30:43.442 --> 30:45.444
We should all have the choice

30:45.477 --> 30:48.347
to live and die
on our own terms.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.152
NOVAK:
No one has the right

30:53.185 --> 30:55.254
to kill another human being.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.589
So why should Amy Solwey
be allowed

30:57.623 --> 31:00.559
to help Christina Nerrit
murder herself?

31:00.592 --> 31:04.130
Now, we'll never know
Christina Nerrit's pain.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.498
But what we do know
is that many depressed people

31:06.532 --> 31:07.967
who attempt suicide

31:08.000 --> 31:11.103
are later thankful
they lived through it.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.505
But Christina Nerrit
never got the chance

31:13.539 --> 31:16.308
to get treatment,
or be grateful she was alive

31:16.342 --> 31:19.678
because Amy Solwey
made it her mission

31:19.711 --> 31:22.014
to help Christina die.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.985
So when you're in the jury room,
you ask yourselves:

31:26.018 --> 31:29.521
If your parent, your child,
your friend or spouse

31:29.555 --> 31:31.991
was suicidal,
what would you want?

31:32.024 --> 31:34.994
Your loved one to get help,

31:35.027 --> 31:41.433
or Amy Solwey telling them
it's okay to give up?

31:56.115 --> 31:59.485
JUDGE:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

31:59.518 --> 32:01.353
is there any chance
that with more time

32:01.387 --> 32:02.454
you can reach a verdict?

32:02.488 --> 32:04.356
No, Your Honor.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.658
We're hopelessly deadlocked.

32:06.692 --> 32:09.528
Then I have no choice but
to declare a mistrial.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.031
You are dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.665
We're adjourned.

32:27.079 --> 32:27.679
How could they
not convict her?

32:28.314 --> 32:29.982
The jury deadlocked
10 to 2.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.151
I underestimated the power
of Moredock's argument.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.085
You can't blame yourself

32:33.119 --> 32:35.154
because two people
wanted to acquit Amy.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.589
The two holdouts
were for conviction.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.259
The majority voted
to let Amy walk.

32:40.292 --> 32:44.063
Well, just let me know when
you need me for the retrial.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.764
There's not going
to be a retrial, John.

32:45.797 --> 32:46.932
Why the hell not?

32:46.965 --> 32:50.469
Because the D.A. doesn't want
to make Amy Solwey a martyr

32:50.502 --> 32:51.703
for assisted suicide.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.604
Translation:

32:52.638 --> 32:54.706
We lose so we're
letting her off the hook.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.841
We'll, we'll get her,

32:55.874 --> 32:58.044
and it's only a matter of time
before she does it again.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.379
So we let her help
someone else die.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.348
I don't like it either, John.
but I don't have a choice.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.215
Well, that's great.

33:03.249 --> 33:06.018
I can't wait to tell
Christina's sister.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.359
Maybe if dying's
what Christina really wanted,

33:13.392 --> 33:14.426
it's okay.

33:14.460 --> 33:19.531
MUNCH:
She never told you
she was suicidal, did she?

33:19.565 --> 33:22.134
Not once.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.235
I could have helped her.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.471
Allison, none of this
is your fault.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.505
Why couldn't she

33:26.538 --> 33:28.540
just have talked to me?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.511
Maybe she didn't want
to burden you.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.713
But now I'm all alone.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.515
She should have thought
about that.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.518
( sighs )

33:39.551 --> 33:40.819
People who commit suicide

33:40.852 --> 33:43.322
don't always consider the mess
they leave behind,

33:43.355 --> 33:46.058
or they think people will be
better off without them.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.094
She was wrong.

33:49.795 --> 33:53.299
You have every right to be mad
at Christina.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.770
I'm not.

33:58.804 --> 34:03.409
I could have stopped her...

34:03.442 --> 34:05.244
the second time

34:05.277 --> 34:08.480
if I'd listened
to the message.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.481
What message?

34:09.515 --> 34:11.317
On her answering
machine.

34:11.350 --> 34:17.756
The night after she tried
to suffocate herself.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.126
I didn't play it
till after the funeral.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.161
Do you still have it?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.098
Yeah.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.766
Over here.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.373
WOMAN ( on tape ):
Sorry you missed the train,

34:34.406 --> 34:35.841
but this time we'll go together.

34:35.874 --> 34:38.277
I'll bring enough to the
hospital for both of us.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.811
Lab's got the actual machine
and tape.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.413
They made a dub
so you could hear it.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.448
Whose voice is that?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.383
It's a TTY relay operator.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.218
Solwey's LUDS show
she made the call

34:46.252 --> 34:47.553
the night before Christina died.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.787
This was
a suicide pact.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.788
Pretty one-sided.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.457
I guess
Amy changed her mind.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.160
Or lied to Christina
to push her over the edge.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.527
Either way,
I'm going to ask the D.A.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.728
to let us
take another crack at Amy.

34:56.762 --> 34:57.729
What's different now?

34:57.763 --> 34:59.598
The charge.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.136
Second degree murder?
Is this the way

35:04.170 --> 35:05.437
you people retaliate?

35:05.471 --> 35:07.139
Simmer down,
Mr. Moredock.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.140
It's not personal.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.241
Sure it is.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.178
Your district attorney branch
hates losing to me.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.181
You'd better not be wasting
my time with politics,
Ms. Novak.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.282
I'm not,
Your Honor.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.650
We can prove Amy Solwey entered
into a suicide pact

35:18.684 --> 35:19.685
with Christina Nerrit.

35:19.718 --> 35:20.852
Ms. Solwey's still alive,

35:20.886 --> 35:23.355
so clearly had no intention
of going through with it.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.524
She just wants
my client to plead out

35:25.557 --> 35:26.758
to a spurious charge...

35:26.792 --> 35:27.659
Read the statute.

35:27.693 --> 35:28.594
When two people enter
into a suicide pact

35:28.627 --> 35:30.729
and one of them pulls out
for personal gain

35:30.762 --> 35:31.863
after the other one is dead,

35:31.897 --> 35:32.931
that's Murder Two.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.933
What could
Amy Solwey possibly gain

35:34.966 --> 35:36.635
by Christina Nerrit's death?

35:36.668 --> 35:37.869
Validation
of her cause.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.305
Which is exactly
what she got

35:39.338 --> 35:40.639
when that jury
deadlocked.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.308
You're not gonna
let her sell you

35:42.341 --> 35:44.276
this bill of goods,
are you, Judge?

35:44.310 --> 35:46.312
Don't insult my intelligence,
Mr. Moredock.

35:46.345 --> 35:47.879
That's how the law's written.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.815
Unless you can prove
Ms. Novak wrong,

35:49.848 --> 35:51.250
we're going back to trial.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.458
How did it go?

35:59.491 --> 36:03.729
Grand Jury took
15 minutes to indict.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.331
You okay?

36:05.364 --> 36:08.234
Amy Solwey deserves
to be put away,

36:08.267 --> 36:11.270
but convicting her is not
going to change a damn thing.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.472
John...

36:14.473 --> 36:16.242
She broke the law.

36:16.275 --> 36:20.212
Okay. Amy goes to prison,
someone takes over her Web site.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.314
More people die
who don't have to.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.316
Gotta be some way
to shut it down.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.285
Maybe not.
I just read

36:26.318 --> 36:28.687
about this Web site where
they're teaching young girls

36:28.720 --> 36:31.290
how to become anorectic and then
hide it from their parents.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.392
Look, there's always going to be
hate and racism on the Internet.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.426
What are you going
to do about it?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.627
Freedom of speech, man.

36:35.661 --> 36:39.265
Someone talks, there's always
somebody there to listen.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.933
BENSON:
You look like you
could use a drink.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.236
Wish I had time.
I'm headed over
to Bellevue.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.871
Thought you might
want to come.

36:45.904 --> 36:49.375
Amy Solwey's
refusing dialysis.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.280
When Judge Bradley hears
about this stunt,

36:54.313 --> 36:55.614
he's gonna blow a gasket.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.317
There's a lot I'd do
to win a case, Ms. Novak,

36:58.350 --> 36:59.618
but I'm on
your side here.

36:59.651 --> 37:00.952
Why are you doing this?

37:00.986 --> 37:05.357
I would rather die now
than in prison.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.526
You mean you'd rather
be a martyr, don't you?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.328
Stop calling me that!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.862
Or do you finally feel
some guilt

37:10.896 --> 37:14.300
over tricking Christina Nerrit
into your bogus suicide pact?

37:15.834 --> 37:17.336
I did not trick her.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.538
I thought by saying
I would die with her,

37:19.571 --> 37:21.407
it would make her feel
more comfortable.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.742
Feel better about her decision.
Her decision.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.344
This won't work.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.446
I'll get a court order
to force the dialysis.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.580
You know full well

37:28.614 --> 37:30.582
no judge will ever issue
such an order.

37:30.616 --> 37:31.617
BENSON:
I can still try.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.355
You can't force me to eat.
I'll just starve.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.990
I thought you're
all about avoiding pain.

37:39.024 --> 37:44.363
When you don't eat,
your body releases endorphins

37:44.396 --> 37:47.633
as it breaks down
its own tissue for fuel.

37:47.666 --> 37:51.937
I'm told it's a very pleasant
and painless death.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.406
( sighs )

37:56.775 --> 37:59.345
I'm looking for Casey Novak.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.613
Yes. Can I help you?

38:01.647 --> 38:04.983
I'm Dr. Nemarich.
Amy Solwey's nephrologist.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.353
I'm sorry,
I can't talk to you.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.521
You may want to contact her
defense attorney.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.522
I did.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.957
He told me to come see you.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.859
About what?
This.

38:13.892 --> 38:19.631
Just faxed over from UNOS--
the National Organ Registry.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.633
They found her a kidney?

38:21.667 --> 38:24.370
We don't have much time.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.371
( knock at door )

38:27.706 --> 38:29.007
( insistent knocking )

38:29.040 --> 38:30.709
Coming. I'm coming.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.979
John, what are you
doing here?

38:34.012 --> 38:35.481
Why the hell
didn't you call me?

38:35.514 --> 38:36.982
There's nothing
anyone can do.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.450
Amy's made her choice.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.451
Which is?

38:39.485 --> 38:40.952
Well, if we're just going
to put her in prison,

38:40.986 --> 38:41.853
it's a waste of a kidney.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.122
Then plead her out
to a lesser charge.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.123
Excuse me?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.426
Don't let her do
this to herself.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.727
You're the one who wanted me

38:48.760 --> 38:51.430
to jump through hoops
to retry her.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.898
Why are you so invested in this?

38:52.931 --> 38:55.501
Her dying isn't worth it.

38:55.534 --> 38:58.370
If we cave on Amy,
it opens the door

38:58.404 --> 39:00.472
for any other perp
who wants to force a plea

39:00.506 --> 39:01.640
by threatening suicide.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.075
I can't jump just because
she's got a gun to my head.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.077
She's different.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.546
No, she's not, John.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.549
I'm sorry.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.520
So am I.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.128
Can you read my lips?

39:23.161 --> 39:24.630
( sighs )

39:24.663 --> 39:25.664
Yes.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.166
Why won't you
take this kidney?

39:28.199 --> 39:30.402
My life. My decision.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.437
Yeah, well,

39:31.470 --> 39:33.572
it's the wrong decision.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.506
Leave me alone.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.409
Why? So you can die alone
in this dump?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.445
Get out!

39:39.478 --> 39:41.513
Great way to catch
that train, isn't it?

39:41.547 --> 39:42.781
I don't want to hurt anymore.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.416
Then let them do the transplant.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.417
No!

39:45.451 --> 39:47.519
It'll take away
your pain.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.620
So I can go to prison?

39:48.654 --> 39:51.790
So you can live.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.060
What do you care
if I live or die?

39:55.093 --> 39:57.062
Because my father killed
himself.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.504
( sighs )

40:05.537 --> 40:10.442
When I was a kid.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.011
I thought it was my fault.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.482
The night before
he blew his brains out,

40:16.515 --> 40:20.519
he punished me
for being a wiseass.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.021
( sighs )

40:23.054 --> 40:26.958
I told him I hated his guts.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.995
Those were the last words
I ever said to him.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.032
( sighs )

40:36.535 --> 40:39.538
It haunts me to this day.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.042
You're the only person
I've ever told.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.181
Why me?

40:50.215 --> 40:51.783
Because

40:51.817 --> 40:54.820
we're the same.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.924
I feel guilty my
father was suffering

40:58.957 --> 41:03.562
and I couldn't help him.

41:03.595 --> 41:07.098
You feel guilty because of
what you did to Christina.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.512
I'm sorry.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.749
I'm so sorry.

41:25.584 --> 41:29.154
I know.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.290
I don't want you to die.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.894
Help me help you.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.798
Please.
