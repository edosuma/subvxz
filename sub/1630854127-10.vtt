00:25.650 --> 00:27.861
So you've never done
construction work before?

00:27.944 --> 00:31.573
No. Like I said, it's just stuff around
the house, helping my ma, you know.

00:31.656 --> 00:35.493
Don't sweat it. There's nothing to it.
And you got the right build for it.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.454
Oh. Well, thanks.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.664
Just come inside,
answer a couple of questions,

00:39.748 --> 00:42.250
and don't even think of it
like a job interview, okay?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.094
What, um… What's that smell?

00:53.595 --> 00:58.558
Oh, you know, probably a dead raccoon
or something down in the crawl space.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.731
-Here you go.
-What's this?

01:05.398 --> 01:07.734
What the heck do you think…?

01:08.234 --> 01:11.237
It's an RC Cola.
The heck's wrong with you?

01:11.905 --> 01:12.781
Sorry.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.991
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

01:19.662 --> 01:23.792
So you looking for full-time? Part-time?

01:24.292 --> 01:27.712
Oh, I mean, I'll take as many hours
as you can give me, you know?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.422
Just depends on what you wanna do.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.343
PDM stands for painting,
design, and maintenance,

01:33.426 --> 01:36.971
so, you know,
all kinds of work to be done.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.769
You go to that bar a lot?

01:45.730 --> 01:48.191
'Cause I never seen you in there before.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.069
-Here.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.614
Let me show you something.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.206
You Catholic?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.924
The only knot I remember from Boy Scouts.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.344
Tourniquet knot.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.098
It gets real tight, don't it?

02:21.015 --> 02:23.309
Your hand'll turn purple
I leave it like that.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.689
Hey, look at me.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.943
I wanna show you a trick.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.746
-Ah!

02:45.206 --> 02:47.500
Oh yeah? Yeah?

02:47.584 --> 02:49.169
-Mm!

02:52.422 --> 02:53.715
Mmm…

03:05.185 --> 03:06.811
Come on, man.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.022
-Quit struggling.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.903
You do not want to piss me off.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.654
Trust me.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.369
No!

03:32.337 --> 03:34.714
Please, God! Please, no! Please, God!

03:34.797 --> 03:36.507
God can't help you.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.635
I'm God.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.267
<i>Prison authorities in Illinois</i>
<i>are preparing to execute</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:48.895
<i>one of America's</i>

03:48.978 --> 03:52.065
<i>A federal judge on Wednesday</i>

03:54.525 --> 03:57.528
<i>He is scheduled to die</i>

04:07.163 --> 04:08.706
<i> It was 1978.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:11.251
<i>The world first saw the horrifying images</i>

04:22.345 --> 04:24.472
Thank God.
They're finally gonna fry that guy.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.892
You do something like that,
you don't deserve to live.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.063
Man's gonna burn in hell
and not fast enough.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.773
He's the worst of the worst.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.359
He is not the worst.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.403
Who's worse than him?

04:41.739 --> 04:42.782
My neighbor.

04:44.993 --> 04:45.994
Oh.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.539
You ever smell a dead body, Linda?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.166
-No.
-I have.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.669
Jeff was cooking 'em up next door.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.755
Smell came right through the vent
into my house.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.591
Can't get it out of my nose.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.428
That smell.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.901
The fuck?

05:20.194 --> 05:22.405
Sorry. My friend's sitting there.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.157
-Whoa.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.700
Fucking loony tune motherfucker!

05:25.783 --> 05:26.951
-Calm down.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.828
Take care of that smirky ass.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.206
You're a fucking freak, dude!

05:40.506 --> 05:43.384
Fifty bucks
for your autograph? No way.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.013
Come on, man.
It's got to be worth at least, what?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.389
A hundred bucks.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.560
That's gonna be a collector's item.
I'm giving you a discount.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.982
Hey. I'll throw in some porno pics
these girls have been sending me.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.109
I got no use for 'em.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.861
Porno pics?

06:01.944 --> 06:03.905
Pussies hanging out, everything.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.073
Okay, JD.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.368
Yo, this is bullshit!

06:08.451 --> 06:09.660
Sorry, fellas.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.997
Don't get mad just 'cause
I'm getting a little sun today.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.291
Why does he get private time
in the yard?

06:15.792 --> 06:16.667
Bitch!

06:32.308 --> 06:33.434
Mm.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.028
Yo, I'm tired of your disrespect, Dahmer.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.947
Disrespect?

06:46.030 --> 06:48.366
Playing with your food,
your fucking sick-ass jokes,

06:48.449 --> 06:51.828
selling your autographs like you
some kind of celebrity or something?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.162
You think prison is a game?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.206
Think we're here
for your fucking amusement?

06:55.289 --> 06:57.583
Hey, man, I didn't mean any disrespect.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.839
I'm just trying to pass my time.
Same as you.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.967
You ain't the same as me.
I've atoned for my sins.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.304
Whatever you did to get in this joint,
it's clear that you got zero remorse.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.934
I'm a Christian,
and I find your behavior offensive.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.689
Okay.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.941
Stop being an asshole
and quit your fucking games.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.860
Scarver! Let's take a walk.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.951
Jeez.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.329
And why exactly
are you doing research on Mr. Dahmer?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.831
I'm not doing research on him.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.584
I just want to see
what he did to get in here.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.586
And see what the big deal about him is.

07:41.669 --> 07:45.590
Time spent in solitary
has put me out of the loop, is all.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.638
Well, Mr. Scarver,
according to the system,

07:52.722 --> 07:54.432
because of your psychiatric condition,

07:54.515 --> 07:57.185
your access to certain
viewing materials is restricted.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.645
Look, like I told the doctors,

07:59.729 --> 08:02.482
certain food causes me
to have these psychotic breaks.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.777
You know, bread, refined sugar,
and all that artificial crap.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.493
Ever since I changed my diet
and found Christ…

08:15.369 --> 08:16.579
I've been okay.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.790
Come on, Ms. G. Pretty please?

08:38.392 --> 08:39.227
Oh…

08:55.076 --> 08:56.035
Uh…

09:33.406 --> 09:36.284
<i>…drank a lot, and when he drank a lot,</i>

09:36.367 --> 09:38.911
<i>yeah, he was abusive.</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:42.373
<i>Maybe that's where</i>
<i>it began to go wrong for John Gacy.</i>

09:42.456 --> 09:45.501
<i>He doesn't know, nor does he seem to care.</i>

09:45.585 --> 09:47.920
<i>He loses himself in his paintings.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:51.799
<i>This is Christ as I see him in myself.</i>

09:51.882 --> 09:55.386
<i>And it's monolithic</i>
<i>because Christ, to me, is monolithic.</i>

09:55.469 --> 09:58.222
<i>He's all things to all people.</i>

09:58.723 --> 10:00.516
<i>You're not worried about facing God?</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:04.312
<i>No. I'm fairly comfortable with him.</i>

10:04.395 --> 10:07.815
<i>At the Catholic services,</i>
<i>I've been the server for the priest</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:09.483
<i>for the last ten years.</i>

10:09.567 --> 10:12.987
<i>And I have no qualms about doing that.</i>

10:13.070 --> 10:16.324
<i>I've had confession, had Communion.</i>

10:16.407 --> 10:19.577
<i>So, I'm at peace with myself.</i>

10:20.202 --> 10:23.623
<i>John Gacy now faces</i>
<i>death by lethal injection.</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:27.835
<i>Tomorrow night we'll hear how</i>
he's <i>the victim for being found guilty.</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:37.136
Hey.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.305
Uh…

10:41.682 --> 10:43.309
Can I talk to you a sec?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.021
Absolutely.

10:48.689 --> 10:52.360
So, why do you think
there's so many of us now?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.819
You mean inmates?

10:53.903 --> 10:57.990
No, I mean, uh, guys like me.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.118
People they call, uh,

11:02.495 --> 11:03.871
serial killers.

11:05.539 --> 11:09.085
Well, I'm not sure
anybody knows the answer to that.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.381
Some say
it's the interstate highway system.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.258
A relatively new invention
in the history of this country.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.054
You can kill somebody and disappear fast,

11:20.137 --> 11:22.264
dump the body a thousand miles away.

11:23.641 --> 11:27.144
Or maybe it was World War II or Vietnam.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.189
Dads coming back
from the war, they're traumatized.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.275
Don't talk about it.
They're absent, abusive.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.985
They raise troubled sons.

11:35.069 --> 11:38.572
There's also the explosion
and wide availability of pornography,

11:38.656 --> 11:41.659
which wasn't the case until the 1970s.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.667
You believe there's such a thing as just…

11:51.836 --> 11:53.045
being evil?

11:55.464 --> 11:58.217
I think you could
probably guess that I do.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.018
You know, I went
to church as a little kid.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.526
And then one Halloween,
I went as the devil.

12:16.652 --> 12:20.573
And, uh, something felt good about that.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.076
Then I got a little older…

12:27.079 --> 12:28.748
and I made an altar to him.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.251
The devil.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.963
And I was planning
on making a life-size one.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.467
That's what I was saving
a lot of the body parts for.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.304
Even in movies, like <i>Star Wars…</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:48.350
you know, I always like
the bad guys more, you know?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.937
Well, so did I.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.607
Those characters <i>are </i>written better.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.777
Yeah.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.198
What do you really want to ask me, Jeff?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.077
Well…

13:11.290 --> 13:17.213
I was watching that, uh,
that John Wayne Gacy on the news.

13:18.130 --> 13:24.261
You know, people say we're the same
'cause we both did terrible things.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.680
But…

13:29.141 --> 13:31.060
I really think we're different.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.812
I admitted to everything.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.189
All of it.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.693
And Gacy still says he didn't do it.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.655
I wanted the death penalty.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.660
And he was saying
that he's not afraid to die,

13:47.743 --> 13:51.831
'cause he's made his peace with God.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.960
And he's gonna go to heaven.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.966
So, I guess my question is,

14:06.887 --> 14:10.558
do you think God's forgiven him
for all that?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.941
Are you asking about him
or about yourself, Jeff?

14:22.319 --> 14:25.155
I don't think I deserve forgiveness
for what I done.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.284
Well, it's not about "deserve," Jeff.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.411
That's the thing about grace.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.580
We don't deserve it, but we get it anyway.

14:34.123 --> 14:38.252
You know, Jesus wasn't alone
when he was dying on the cross.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.755
There were two criminals
that were being crucified with him.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.384
And one of them said to Jesus,
kind of making fun of him,

14:45.968 --> 14:49.638
he says, "Hey, if you're the Son of God,
why don't you save yourself?"

14:50.139 --> 14:52.141
"And save us while you're at it."

14:52.224 --> 14:55.019
But the other one,
he shouts this guy down,

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
says, "Hold on."

14:56.687 --> 15:00.190
"You and me, we're criminals.
We're getting what we deserve."

15:00.274 --> 15:04.486
"But this guy, Jesus,
he didn't do nothing wrong."

15:06.196 --> 15:07.573
Then he says to Jesus,

15:08.949 --> 15:11.452
"Remember me
when you come into your kingdom."

15:13.621 --> 15:16.081
And so, Jesus turns to him,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.459
and you know what he says?

15:19.877 --> 15:23.505
He says, "Today, you will be
with me in paradise."

15:24.173 --> 15:26.842
Jesus didn't ask him
what he'd done to get crucified,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.510
didn't ask him if he was sorry.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.138
All this guy had to do to be saved

15:31.221 --> 15:33.849
was to believe
that Jesus was the Son of God.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.979
And let us not forget,
Heavenly Father,

15:40.105 --> 15:43.484
that you are a loving,
merciful, and just God.

15:44.818 --> 15:50.741
And we ask that we may practice
mercy and forgiveness in our own lives

15:51.325 --> 15:54.954
as you have shown mercy
and forgiveness to us.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.541
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.335
Amen.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.670
Amen.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.838
And Sandra?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.758
She's good.
About to have her second baby.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.636
Praise the Lord.
Boy or girl?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.681
We don't know yet.
We fixing to find out next week.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.684
-Well, give her my best when you see her.
-I will.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.854
So, why'd you want to see me?

16:24.400 --> 16:25.484
Well, Pastor…

16:28.737 --> 16:34.201
what you said in your closing prayer
today about forgiveness,

16:35.119 --> 16:36.245
showing mercy,

16:36.328 --> 16:39.039
I mean, I know
it's the Christian thing to do.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.458
And we all have fallen short,

16:41.542 --> 16:46.005
and at some point or another,
we all deserve grace.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.597
But when it comes to Jeff Dahmer,

16:57.266 --> 16:58.726
I can't forgive him.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.816
Even though there may be
something wrong with his brain,

17:05.899 --> 17:08.485
or he couldn't control hisself…

17:11.530 --> 17:12.614
I can't.

17:14.283 --> 17:18.495
My heart is full of hate.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.415
Mmm.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.583
Revenge.

17:24.585 --> 17:29.798
I thought him being in jail
for the rest of his life would be enough.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.177
It's not.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.184
I want to see him suffer.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.022
I even have nightmares about it.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.070
And I see myself hurting him.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.366
Giving him pain,

17:57.910 --> 18:00.788
making him beg for mercy.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.085
I'm scared, Pastor.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.214
I'm so scared.

18:12.674 --> 18:17.262
I just wish
I could get past these feelings.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.098
You know? That… that…

18:20.432 --> 18:24.186
that… that I could
stop living in vengeance.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.648
That I could get to a better place.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.943
Maybe, I don't know, maybe not forgiveness

18:31.026 --> 18:32.945
but something close to it?

18:38.534 --> 18:42.704
'Cause if I keep letting hate
and anger consume me…

18:46.542 --> 18:48.794
I'm not gonna know myself no more.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.552
You have a big heart, Glenda.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.098
Which can be both a blessing and a curse.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.810
And you have every right
to feel those feelings

19:04.893 --> 19:06.520
and think those thoughts.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.148
But how do I make them stop?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
You can't.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.776
-You can't.

19:12.860 --> 19:17.739
All you can do is pray for strength
and ask for God's guidance every day.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.327
And perhaps come to church
a little more often.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.873
Yeah.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.082
Yeah.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.419
It's not gonna happen overnight.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.547
It just takes time.

19:35.132 --> 19:40.137
And then one day,
maybe a month from now, maybe a year,

19:42.055 --> 19:44.349
you will see
Jeffrey Dahmer's face somewhere,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.768
and you won't feel a thing.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.997
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Jeff.

20:07.080 --> 20:07.915
How you doing?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.583
-Good to see you.
-You too.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.251
-You look good.
-Thanks.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.461
You look healthier.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.837
-I do?
-Yeah.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.297
Hmm.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.885
Maybe it's the pills they got me on.
They gave me that Prozac.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.054
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.680
What, you think it helps?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.433
Yeah, I think it helps even me out.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.730
And there's no booze in here.
I think that was a lot of my problem.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.649
Yeah, I think so too.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.778
You miss it, the drinking?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.739
Oh, every hour of every day.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.823
Yeah.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.493
So it's probably good
I can't get any, you know?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.124
I was thinking about you and Shari.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.753
You guys should, uh, maybe go
on a vacation with all that book money.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.005
Oh, yeah, the book, yeah.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.550
Yeah. The book didn't do so well, Jeff.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.345
Uh, the reviews were good, but--

21:03.428 --> 21:05.097
And I understand why.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.473
I think a lot of people…

21:08.183 --> 21:11.979
thought that I was trying to profit
from the victims and whatnot.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.107
You know? It's not true.
But what are you gonna do?

21:15.774 --> 21:19.111
It was probably cursed
from the beginning, so…

21:19.194 --> 21:20.153
Hm.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.615
Yeah.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.244
Uh…

21:28.578 --> 21:30.289
There's something I gotta tell you.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.083
Something I'm planning on doing.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.505
I want to get baptized.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.258
Jeff…

21:42.050 --> 21:43.427
That's wonderful, son.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.681
I thought you'd be happy.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.268
Only problem is
they don't got a baptismal tank in here,

21:51.351 --> 21:55.063
and, uh, I still got to
find somebody to baptize me.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.316
It's just-- That's so great.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.610
-Yeah.
-That's so great.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.946
And, you know, uh…

22:06.533 --> 22:10.329
baptism's all about
washing away all your sins.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.164
Uh…

22:13.457 --> 22:17.627
God forgiving you is one thing.
I know he can do that, but, uh…

22:19.755 --> 22:22.299
I guess what I wanted
to ask you, Dad, is if, uh…

22:27.304 --> 22:29.139
if you could ever forgive me.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.565
I will.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.361
I'll forgive you, son.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.281
I do.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.200
I have.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.329
Because you're my son.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.585
Yeah.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.755
That's good.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.218
Thanks, Dad.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.364
Hey there.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.659
Glenda, thank you for coming.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.035
Thank you for inviting me.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.371
You Lao folks
sure know how to throw a wedding.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.956
Please, sit.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.502
Whiskey?

23:40.585 --> 23:41.586
Oh, no. I'm good.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.671
It's tradition.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.674
Okay.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.686
Ooh.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.313
That is strong.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.150
Better not have too many of these

24:03.233 --> 24:05.902
or you might not even remember
your son's wedding.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.032
I'm really happy for you, Sounthone.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.619
You and your family deserve this.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.664
Especially after everything
that's happened.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.584
Today's a good day.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.050
I try to be happy for my family.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.930
I smile. I try to be strong.

24:36.224 --> 24:40.812
I keep waiting
to feel like myself again before.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.857
It just gets worse.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.943
Because every morning I get up,

24:47.986 --> 24:51.698
and I remember
Jeffrey Dahmer is still alive.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.743
But not Konerak.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.579
Not my son.

24:58.705 --> 24:59.748
I get it.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.336
Maybe the best we can do

25:05.003 --> 25:07.297
is just keep pretending to be strong.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.677
And eventually, one day,
maybe we'll forget we're pretending.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.941
Come on, Sounthone.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.777
Let's get out on this dance floor
and show 'em how it's done.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.744
Okay.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.290
"Dahmer vs. Jesus"?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.417
Is this for real?

25:44.501 --> 25:47.337
It's the newest issue
in his <i>Jeffrey Dahmer</i> series.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.421
Hmm.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.132
Just when you thought folks
couldn't stoop any lower.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.342
It's sick.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.053
It's like they're
making him into a superhero.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.596
Freedom of speech, my ass.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.681
I know, girl.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.600
Though, to be honest, I'm not sure
who should be offended more,

26:00.684 --> 26:02.018
us or Jesus.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.395
So what do we do?

26:03.478 --> 26:05.355
I say we file another lawsuit.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.692
But we lost the last one.
Aren't we just gonna lose again?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.068
There's a chance we might.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.778
Then is it really worth it?

26:11.861 --> 26:15.490
Are you saying that we should
just forgive and forget what Dahmer did

26:15.574 --> 26:18.159
and allow these folks
to continue to profit off of him?

26:18.243 --> 26:21.955
Why expend all that effort
to file another lawsuit

26:22.038 --> 26:24.332
if at the end of the day
we lose again in court?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.334
Because it makes a statement.

26:27.335 --> 26:31.631
It reminds people
that Jeff Dahmer isn't a superhero.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.508
He's a serial killer.

26:35.510 --> 26:40.098
It also reminds them that our sons
weren't just Jeff Dahmer's victims.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.018
They were real people. They lived.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.395
They sang in the choir,

26:46.146 --> 26:49.524
loved to dance, teased their sisters.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.278
They were young men who had hopes
and dreams for the future.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.155
And mothers…

26:57.490 --> 26:59.159
who loved them.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.121
So even if we lose in court,

27:03.204 --> 27:05.749
if we can manage to get that point across,

27:05.832 --> 27:07.876
we win without winning.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.216
I know I'm not going to read this.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.095
But I hope Jesus
whoops Jeffrey Dahmer's ass.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.692
Don't look right at it.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.819
Put these on.

27:34.903 --> 27:35.779
Thanks.

27:36.404 --> 27:39.366
Really makes it hard
to doubt there's a God, doesn't it?

27:39.449 --> 27:41.326
Total eclipse of the sun.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.330
<i>The hour John Wayne Gacy's executed.</i>

27:46.122 --> 27:48.458
<i>The same day Jeffrey Dahmer's baptized.</i>

27:48.541 --> 27:50.919
We use this for
rehabbing injuries and whatnot.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.504
-Will this work?
-I… Um…

27:53.463 --> 27:55.757
Yeah, I believe it would.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.925
Anything else you need?

27:57.008 --> 27:59.844
I'm sorry. You're giving me
everything I'm asking for.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.596
I thought this was
gonna be a lot harder.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.682
Religion pacifies.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.894
<i> You know, Warden, I spoke to him,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna tell you</i>

28:07.977 --> 28:09.854
<i>what I told your chaplains here.</i>

28:09.938 --> 28:13.942
Dahmer wants to be saved. It is genuine.

28:15.068 --> 28:18.238
John Wayne Gacy,
do you have any last words?

28:19.489 --> 28:20.699
Uh…

28:21.991 --> 28:23.326
How about

28:24.244 --> 28:26.287
you all kiss my ass.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.833
How's that for last words?

28:31.710 --> 28:32.836
Where you going, JD?

28:33.420 --> 28:34.879
I'm getting baptized.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.507
Yeah! Good for you, Jeff.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.948
Someone made that for you?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.033
Yeah, nice, right?

29:04.117 --> 29:05.744
<i>Some lady in Oklahoma.</i>

29:24.262 --> 29:25.722
Motherfucker, man.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.607
Jeff, I baptize you

29:35.690 --> 29:37.400
<i>in the name of the Father,</i>

29:39.194 --> 29:40.361
<i>the Son,</i>

29:41.946 --> 29:43.156
<i>and the Holy Spirit</i>

29:44.240 --> 29:45.867
for the forgiveness of sin.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.578
I don't know what to do.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.623
God Almighty, Heavenly Father,
you got to talk to me!

29:52.123 --> 29:54.042
<i>You've got to tell me what to do!</i>

30:22.403 --> 30:24.656
Official time of death, 12:58.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.451
-That son of a bitch.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.456
-Welcome to the family of God.
-Yeah.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.252
-Yeah.
-Congratulations, Jeff.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.046
You're saved.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.634
Thanks.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.136
Thank you.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.805
<i>Talk to me, Lord, please.</i>

30:49.722 --> 30:52.100
<i>Just tell me what I gotta do.</i>

30:53.685 --> 30:54.686
I'll do it.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.969
Work duty.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.112
<i>So, JD,</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:48.448
what you gonna do
with your 25 cents an hour?

31:48.531 --> 31:51.618
Blow it on porn or cigarettes?

31:52.493 --> 31:53.411
Don't know.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.455
Probably just give it to the church.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.458
Well, that's fucking lame.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.424
-Oh.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.508
You got me.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.344
I'm just fucking with you, man.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.190
Work duty.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.849
Hey. You guys are getting
some help this morning.

33:01.104 --> 33:02.063
Sure.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.607
Fine by me.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.216
I'm gonna clean the locker rooms.
Wanna lend me a hand?

33:30.717 --> 33:31.592
Okay.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.191
Jesse?

34:39.744 --> 34:40.953
What'd you do to him?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.456
Don't cry for him.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.168
Dude murdered his wife.

34:47.710 --> 34:51.339
Stabbed her in the face five fucking times
and tried to pin it on two Black guys.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.509
Ain't that some shit?

34:58.846 --> 35:01.599
But ain't nothing compared
to what you did though, Dahmer.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.108
So, you didn't just murder them.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.194
You desecrated their bodies.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.738
And cannibalized their flesh.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.115
Answer me, Dahmer!

35:18.324 --> 35:19.867
Did you really eat their flesh?

35:22.245 --> 35:23.746
-Yes.
-God…

35:26.165 --> 35:27.750
And that 14-year-old boy?

35:30.962 --> 35:32.463
-Yes.
-Oh, what the fuck?

35:33.673 --> 35:35.174
What made you do it?

35:36.425 --> 35:37.593
Did you enjoy it?

35:38.427 --> 35:39.428
I was lost.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.390
I turned away from God.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.725
So you believe in God?

35:45.768 --> 35:47.436
Yes, I do.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.148
I've returned to God.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.442
I feel…

35:55.778 --> 35:56.779
changed.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.411
I believe in God too.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.749
But my God is a god of vengeance.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.169
And He punishes evil.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.046
Been in it for a long time.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.633
And when He can't do it himself,
he sends in vessels

36:17.717 --> 36:19.302
to execute His justice.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.182
The Lord spoke to me, Dahmer.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.645
He asked me to punish you

36:29.729 --> 36:32.148
for all them innocent lives you took

36:32.231 --> 36:34.233
and them families you destroyed.

36:35.276 --> 36:39.697
You may convince yourself
that God has forgiven you.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.076
But you can never escape God's wrath.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.164
It always catches up with you.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.209
Always.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.088
See, Dahmer,

36:59.258 --> 37:00.551
I'm His vessel.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.598
Understand?

37:20.029 --> 37:20.988
Okay.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.505
You liked seeing them men
in pain, didn't you?

37:48.182 --> 37:49.892
And that 14-year-old boy,

37:50.726 --> 37:52.728
when you did them horrible things to him.

37:52.812 --> 37:53.771
No.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.566
I drugged 'em first
so they wouldn't feel anything.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.447
Well, Dahmer,

38:04.740 --> 38:06.701
you 'bout to feel every second of this.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.674
In the name of the Father,

39:05.343 --> 39:06.510
the Son,

39:08.095 --> 39:09.513
and the Holy Ghost.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.062
Amen.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.168
Hello?

39:39.960 --> 39:41.003
Speaking.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.799
Oh, no. Uh…

39:45.383 --> 39:46.967
Okay, we'll be right there.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.890
-Mr. Dahmer--
-Is he okay? Can we see him?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.350
Just, um…

39:56.060 --> 39:57.478
I'm afraid it's bad news.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.479
No.

40:41.897 --> 40:45.943
Oh, my God…

40:47.611 --> 40:49.238
God, Jeff, I'm sorry.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.162
Oh…

41:07.006 --> 41:08.007
I love you.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.304
I've loved you
since the day you were born.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.100
And I'll love you till the day that I die.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.552
What?

41:54.345 --> 41:55.971
I didn't say a thing, did I?

42:04.647 --> 42:06.732
Mr. Dahmer, Ms. Flint?

42:09.777 --> 42:10.778
Please.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.657
<i>I don't understand.</i>

42:14.740 --> 42:16.408
Jeff's body's been cremated.

42:16.492 --> 42:19.078
They sent the remains
to Shari and me two weeks ago.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.454
Half his remains.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.541
The other half went to me, okay?
His mother.

42:23.624 --> 42:26.418
After your son was killed,

42:26.502 --> 42:29.088
there was, of course, an autopsy.

42:29.171 --> 42:32.132
And when they do that,
you know, the body is kind of--

42:32.216 --> 42:33.050
Dissected?

42:33.133 --> 42:34.927
-Lionel knows all about that.

42:35.010 --> 42:37.555
He's who kind of sparked
Jeff's interest in the subject.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.598
You're a piece of work, aren't you, Joyce?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.517
Guys? Look, could we--?

42:42.184 --> 42:46.230
The brain was removed
to determine the cause of death.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.483
Now, Ms. Flint feels
that we have an opportunity here

42:49.567 --> 42:51.527
for something good
to come out of all this.

42:51.610 --> 42:55.906
Scientists at Fresno State University
would like to study Jeff's brain.

42:55.990 --> 42:59.410
What… Hold on. I don't understand.

42:59.493 --> 43:01.579
Where…
Where's his brain been all this time?

43:01.662 --> 43:03.038
I mean, where is it now?

43:03.664 --> 43:04.623
Madison.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.587
<i>In the pathology lab,</i>
<i>at the University of Wisconsin.</i>

43:12.548 --> 43:13.757
No way, no. No way.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.552
Lionel, please. Just listen for once.

43:16.635 --> 43:17.845
He wrote a will.

43:18.554 --> 43:21.974
He said he wanted to be cremated
as soon as possible, his whole body.

43:22.057 --> 43:24.101
You know,
his brain's part of his body, okay?

43:24.727 --> 43:27.646
He said no open casket,
no funeral, no headstone, no marker.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.107
If you care so much about Jeff's wishes,

43:30.190 --> 43:32.276
why'd you have
a memorial service for him then?

43:32.359 --> 43:34.320
It was just a few family friends.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.779
But not his mother.

43:36.614 --> 43:40.284
Okay, the brain should be cremated.
It should have been when the body was.

43:40.367 --> 43:44.204
We have a chance here, Lionel,
to find out why he was the way he was.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.915
-Was it something he was born with?

43:48.083 --> 43:50.669
Maybe there was
some small tumor somewhere?

43:50.753 --> 43:54.840
I think each of us has our own idea about
why Jeff was the way he was, don't we?

43:54.923 --> 43:56.300
Oh, stop it. Shame on you.

43:56.383 --> 43:58.844
You know,
they just did this very same thing

43:58.927 --> 44:01.722
with that, uh, John Wayne Gacy.

44:01.805 --> 44:05.517
They took out his brain,
and they made slides and whatnot.

44:05.601 --> 44:08.145
You know what conclusion
they reached? Perfectly normal.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.356
Well, that's what
they're gonna say about Jeff's too.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.523
How do you know?

44:14.360 --> 44:16.612
Answer is no, Joyce.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.405
Never gonna happen.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.950
No, I think we need to try
to put this behind us.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.994
Quit dragging it out and just…

44:24.995 --> 44:26.205
you know, move on.

44:28.707 --> 44:33.879
Mr. Dahmer, this is something that
Mrs. Flint will choose to pursue in court.

44:34.838 --> 44:36.131
Yeah, I bet she will.

44:38.884 --> 44:42.304
If you be good, I'mma let you watch
cartoons when we get home, okay?

44:43.347 --> 44:45.432
All right, let's see.

44:46.517 --> 44:49.144
They got Oreos, Chips Ahoy, and Kee–

44:49.228 --> 44:51.021
Cookies! Cookies!

44:51.105 --> 44:52.648
Okay. Which one you want?

44:52.731 --> 44:54.858
-All of them!

44:54.942 --> 44:58.404
I'mma get you two.
You know why? You're spoiled.

44:58.487 --> 45:02.282
And you know why you're spoiled?
'Cause you're Granny's little rascal.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.993
Come on, help me put this stuff up there.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.912
You gonna be a big boy and help me?

45:13.460 --> 45:14.545
Next.

45:16.338 --> 45:20.134
The court recognizes
a rather unusual situation here.

45:20.217 --> 45:23.804
It's one I certainly never encountered
before and probably won't again.

45:25.097 --> 45:28.642
We have competing interest
from the two parents of the deceased.

45:28.726 --> 45:32.980
I recognize the statement
of wishes of Jeffrey Dahmer.

45:34.481 --> 45:37.359
And I'm also concerned
with the issue of closure.

45:37.443 --> 45:42.531
This is a rather evil chapter
in our human existence, so to speak.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.576
I believe it would be
beneficial to the public

45:45.659 --> 45:49.079
and all concerned that there be closure.

45:50.539 --> 45:54.668
And that this matter is resolved
once and for all, and we move on.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.463
Therefore…

45:59.923 --> 46:02.301
I hereby order the brain to be destroyed.

46:10.142 --> 46:14.688
<i>I also have to say, I object</i>
<i>to the very nature of this inquiry.</i>

46:16.106 --> 46:19.151
<i>When one considers</i>
<i>an individual like the deceased,</i>

46:19.943 --> 46:22.780
<i>there is a temptation to try to know,</i>

46:22.863 --> 46:24.782
<i>and know definitively,</i>

46:24.865 --> 46:27.159
<i>why someone like Jeffrey Dahmer</i>

46:27.242 --> 46:28.535
<i>is what he is.</i>

46:29.328 --> 46:30.579
<i>Or was.</i>

46:32.414 --> 46:34.833
<i>I think there's a real danger there.</i>

46:36.543 --> 46:39.463
<i>There are no easy answers</i>
<i>when it comes to someone like him.</i>

46:43.634 --> 46:46.386
<i>You'll never know why he did what he did.</i>

46:51.183 --> 46:55.854
That's an uncomfortable truth, to be sure,
but it's one you need to accept.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.329
Thank you for seeing me today, Ms. Yang.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.957
Of course, and I appreciate
your patience, Ms. Cleveland.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.959
-We had to reschedule a few times.
-Seven.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.085
I'm sorry?

47:18.168 --> 47:19.336
Seven times.

47:19.878 --> 47:22.923
That's how many times
your office rescheduled this meeting.

47:23.006 --> 47:24.132
But it's okay.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.845
Like all those times
I called the cops on Dahmer,

47:27.928 --> 47:30.222
I'm used to having to be persistent.

47:30.973 --> 47:33.475
So, Ms. Cleveland,
how can I help you today?

47:33.976 --> 47:38.730
Well, I wanted to see
how the progress was on the park.

47:39.523 --> 47:40.524
The park?

47:40.607 --> 47:42.860
Mm-hmm. The park memorial.

47:43.443 --> 47:49.074
I was told that the city was planning
to turn the old Oxford Apartments on 25th

47:49.157 --> 47:51.493
into a park after it was demolished.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.747
So I wrote your office a letter
saying y'all ought to make the park

47:55.831 --> 47:57.666
a memorial to Dahmer's victims.

47:57.749 --> 48:00.210
And you wrote me back a real nice letter.

48:00.294 --> 48:03.338
Signed your name and everything,
saying that you would look into it.

48:03.422 --> 48:04.965
Yes, right. Um…

48:05.048 --> 48:09.636
So anyway, I'm here on behalf of some
of the victims' families to get an update.

48:09.720 --> 48:13.599
And I walked past there the other day,
and it's still a vacant lot.

48:13.682 --> 48:15.017
I mean, I…

48:15.100 --> 48:16.435
It's been nearly two years.

48:16.518 --> 48:18.186
So I'm checking our system,

48:18.270 --> 48:21.899
and it seems we're still waiting
on some permit approvals.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.609
How long do those take?

48:23.692 --> 48:27.529
Well, it's hard to say until Public Works
finishes its safety inspection,

48:27.613 --> 48:31.283
which they can't start until City Planning
Department starts their inspection.

48:31.366 --> 48:36.496
Ms. Yang,
all we are asking for is a damn park.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.081
That shouldn't be that hard.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.167
We're not asking you to build a Taj Mahal.

48:40.250 --> 48:44.546
Ms. Cleveland, building anything
in the city involves a lot of red tape.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.965
I realize it's frustrating.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.135
But can I be honest?

48:51.178 --> 48:53.722
There are a lot of people here

48:53.805 --> 48:55.807
who don't want
to build anything on that lot.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.685
They'd just as soon forget what happened.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.938
Not everybody can forget.

49:01.647 --> 49:05.734
Y'all demolished the building,
but that doesn't erase what happened.

49:05.817 --> 49:07.945
It only erases the victims.

49:08.028 --> 49:12.574
And all we are asking
is that y'all put something on that site

49:12.658 --> 49:14.326
that honors their memory.

49:14.409 --> 49:16.078
It's the right thing to do.

49:16.161 --> 49:17.913
It's the decent thing to do.

49:19.414 --> 49:23.335
So will you please
discuss this with your supervisor

49:23.418 --> 49:25.087
or whomever can do something?

49:25.170 --> 49:26.088
Absolutely.

49:26.171 --> 49:29.800
And I will do everything in my power
to help expedite that process.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.928
But from my experience,
these things take time,

49:33.011 --> 49:36.556
and I'm afraid that you and the families
probably have to wait a little longer.

49:40.435 --> 49:42.020
Well, that's all right, Ms. Yang.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.731
'Cause I'm used to waitin'.

49:46.108 --> 49:48.652
<i>I am determined to see this through.</i>

49:49.194 --> 49:50.237
<i>For the victims.</i>

49:51.321 --> 49:52.447
<i>For the families.</i>

49:53.657 --> 49:55.993
<i>I ain't gonna let Jeff Dahmer and his evil</i>

49:56.076 --> 49:57.995
<i>be the only thing folks remember.</i>

49:59.246 --> 50:02.249
<i>As long as I have breath,</i>
<i>I'll keep waiting.</i>
