02:02.755 --> 02:04.289
Oh, shit.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.325
-Great to see you, too.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.161
-Sorry.
It's just early.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.096
It's 10:30.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.731
-Jesus, it's <i> that</i> early?

02:12.733 --> 02:15.934
-I tried calling.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.604
-Shit.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.905
Where's Harry?

02:19.907 --> 02:22.074
-Doug and I are moving --
to Phoenix.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.476
-Phoenix? What, are you
taking Harry with you?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.278
-Of course I'm taking Harry
with me. He's my son.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.779
-Sarah,
how can you do this to me?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.515
-It takes money
to raise a child,

02:29.517 --> 02:31.016
and I don't have enough.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.285
-Me and Zack are working
on a lot of businesses.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.820
Some opportunities
are coming our way.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.689
We got some big ideas,
and pretty soon...

02:37.691 --> 02:40.125
This is Fred and mordechai.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.493
My roommates.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.828
Which is temporary.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.097
That is a situation
i am resolving.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.299
-Whatever.
I have bills to pay.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.001
-Okay, I can change.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.769
You let me to move back in...
-Move in?

02:50.771 --> 02:52.037
With me and Doug?
-Sure!

02:52.039 --> 02:54.973
I can crash on the couch
or whatever.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.675
Wait, so that's it?

02:56.677 --> 02:59.478
Well, what about tomorrow?
Am I still picking up Harry?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.946
Sarah, he has all his stuff
over here.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.682
Like, all his toys
and his favorite things.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.018
Look, he loves this penguin guy.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.221
Sarah, come on.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.133
I'm gonna come.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.301
I'm gonna come.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.170
-Use a sock.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.972
-Okay.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.216
Oh!

03:37.218 --> 03:39.251
Oh!

03:47.827 --> 03:50.896
-I have five rooms and laundry.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.699
-Oh, okay.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.167
Oh, yeah.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.375
-That's it?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.743
-I can get more.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.015
Car keys.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.150
So you don't have
to take the bus.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.474
-You know, Carl sagan
was actually

04:35.476 --> 04:37.976
a pretty
strong amateur player himself.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.479
When he wasn't stargazing,
he was serving.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.825
He's got to be paying her.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.960
-Check it out.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.128
-What is that -- a motor home?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.763
-No, it's a gold mine.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.931
It's a traveling motel.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.833
The motel with wheels.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.436
-I don't get it.
-It's -- well, you know,

05:04.438 --> 05:06.938
most of the time,
people go <i> to</i> a motel.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.674
The traveling motel
comes to you.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.076
-Why would I want a motel
to come to me?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.678
Unless I'm like
a homeless person?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.647
Is this a shelter?
-It's for the discerning guest.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.117
For people who want to travel
under the radar, incognito.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.952
-This is worse
than your last idea.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.487
Come on, man.
I got to make some money.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.289
-It's all in the way
you market it.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.792
And for the record, a portable
battery charger is a great idea.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.628
-It was a battery charger
powered by batteries.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.962
It makes no sense.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.297
-Whatever.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.132
You see the ad?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.068
-What could she possibly see
in him?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.473
-He's a landowner.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
Where she's from,
that's a big deal.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.811
-Where is she from?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.846
-Not here.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.348
-Yeah, well, his aunt
owns this place.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.817
He's just the manager.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.485
-You ever manage anything?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.621
-You have a shitty little
personality. You know that?

05:56.623 --> 05:59.958
-This type of advertising
pays off big-time.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.326
It's the same type of stuff
I'm gonna be doing

06:01.328 --> 06:02.661
with traveling motel.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.995
And if you get in now,

06:03.997 --> 06:05.731
I'll make you a silent partner.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.232
-Well, someone needs to be.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.001
-Read it.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.871
The gateway to happiness."

06:12.873 --> 06:14.406
Why is the name in French?

06:14.408 --> 06:16.675
-Uh, it's more sophisticated.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.078
-"Featuring breathtaking
scenery, outdoor activities,

06:20.080 --> 06:21.346
and free Wi-Fi."

06:21.348 --> 06:23.415
Wait, there's Internet here?
-No.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.851
-Then why are you advertising
that you have it?

06:25.853 --> 06:29.388
-You guys buy lottery tickets?

06:29.390 --> 06:31.056
It's up to like $40 million.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.858
-You know
you're like a hundred times

06:32.860 --> 06:35.394
more likely to get struck by
lightning than win that thing?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.896
-Although it kind of seems like
you already won the lottery --

06:37.898 --> 06:39.331
with the maid.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.234
-She's not the maid.
-She cleans my room.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.669
-Yeah, well, I know
she's the maid, but she also --

06:44.671 --> 06:47.706
-give you hand jobs.
-She has a name.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.441
It's lupita.
-Oh.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.410
-What you should be doing
with your money is investing it

06:51.412 --> 06:54.045
into something solid,
like the traveling motel.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.881
-It's gonna be
a pretty big deal.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.117
-Yeah.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.719
-Why didn't Fred
take out the trash?

07:00.721 --> 07:02.454
-You fired Fred.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.890
-Well, he still lives here.
Might as well keep working.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.625
-I don't think
he knows he's fired.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.727
-Delores says
we can't afford him.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.530
Oh, hey, check this out.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.533
Someone left this in room five.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.402
Looks real, huh?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.404
-Uh, speaking of your aunt,
she called twice.

07:19.406 --> 07:23.408
-What did she say?
-Call her back.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.110
Oh, and the phone company
called.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.379
They said they're gonna turn
off the phones.

07:27.381 --> 07:30.882
You pay the bill?

07:30.884 --> 07:33.418
You need to get that chair
off the roof.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.153
It's not professional.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.093
- Come on, Fred.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.261
You at least got to swing at it,
buddy.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.063
You got to try, okay?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.823
So...

08:11.825 --> 08:13.825
You and Chad, huh?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.661
Doing it.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.129
I, uh...

08:18.131 --> 08:21.867
I think I should let you know --
Chad's a liar.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.301
-Liar?

08:23.303 --> 08:26.438
-Yeah. Pathological,
among other things.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.039
You know he doesn't even
own this motel, right?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.274
It's his aunt's.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.675
She doesn't even like him.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.178
-My father was a liar.
-Well, yeah, okay.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.479
So you get what I'm
talking about. You know.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.313
-He used to wear
my mother's dresses.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.049
-I don't know if Chad
gets into all that, but...

08:38.051 --> 08:40.952
-When I was a kid,
i caught him putting on makeup.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.489
He told me he was going
to a Halloween party.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.725
It was in June.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.495
-So he wasn't really
going to the party.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.832
-I hate liars.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.468
-Yeah, I can see why you would.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.737
Okay, we'll see you later, then.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.342
Hey.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.810
Freddy.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.865
- Damn, man.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.833
I got blood everywhere.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.202
-You sure this is it?

09:31.204 --> 09:32.904
-This is the address.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.373
-It don't look three-star to me.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.175
-Yeah, well, we wouldn't even
be here if you hadn't gotten us

09:37.177 --> 09:38.710
in this mess, anyway.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.846
-I told you he was dead
when I showed up, man.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.715
And even if that was true,

09:43.717 --> 09:45.216
it don't explain
why we got to be out here

09:45.218 --> 09:47.285
in the middle of nowhere.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.055
-Too much heat on us back there.

09:50.057 --> 09:53.291
This is better.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.594
-Maybe we can go golfing
while we out here.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.090
-Damn.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.225
You're like traveling
with a girl.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.614
-Yo, what up, my brothers?

10:49.616 --> 10:50.915
-We need a room.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.251
-Dope.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.621
There you go.
Did you see our ad?

10:56.623 --> 10:59.424
-Said this place was French
and it had three stars.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.859
-Certainly did.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.395
Our guests
rave about our pool and cabana.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.832
And we have
a complimentary breakfast,

11:07.834 --> 11:09.734
which I'm sure
you two read about.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.972
And for just a small fee,

11:13.974 --> 11:15.874
I can upgrade you two
to our deluxe suite,

11:15.876 --> 11:17.342
which, you --

11:22.515 --> 11:24.215
you know what? Actually, I'm
just gonna waive the fee on that

11:24.217 --> 11:27.218
and hook a brother up, right?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.520
Great.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.388
How long will you
be staying with us?

11:30.390 --> 11:33.024
-We don't know yet.
-Not a problem.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.959
-Hey, they got a golf course
around here?

11:34.961 --> 11:37.896
-If there is one,
it will be in here.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.032
All right.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.068
So, let's see.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.071
"Garage, go-kart.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.305
Golf course."

11:49.308 --> 11:52.043
Sure, yeah. You -- you
go ahead and keep that.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.912
-You got clubs?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.413
-I think the manager might.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.416
And, you know, for $10,
i can rent those to you.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.351
You know what? I'm just gonna
waive the fee on that, too.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.688
Keep it real.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.056
-The key.

12:05.058 --> 12:05.557
-Right.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.564
Hope you gentlemen enjoy
your stay at pe-tit paradis.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.366
If you need anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.203
Stay black.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.871
-Those guys your cousins
or something?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.339
-They just checked in.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.907
I think the ad is working.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.576
-They don't look right.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.111
Keep an eye on them.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.213
-Did you just put that thing
in the freezer?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.914
-Why? She call again?
-No.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.683
Uh, it's just
not good for business.

12:31.685 --> 12:32.851
-You said the ad was working.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.587
-Yeah, it is.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.056
One more thing --
do you have any golf clubs?

12:38.058 --> 12:40.091
They asked for them.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.559
-Shed.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.763
20 bucks.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.231
-Oh, and I think, uh,

12:46.233 --> 12:47.899
they were pretty interested
in the pool area,

12:47.901 --> 12:50.335
so we might want
to clean that up for them.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.515
-Where's the other bed?

13:15.060 --> 13:17.128
So, I'm gonna call 'em,
figure out what time

13:17.130 --> 13:18.897
tomorrow we should meet up.
-Whoa, whoa.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.933
You ain't ever really been
all that good with the phone.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.067
I should probably handle this.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.171
Yeah.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.106
Now, they ain't gonna like
a three-star motel.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.774
These people got money.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.810
Probably classy.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.917
It's ringing.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.018
Hello?!

13:40.020 --> 13:42.587
Yes, hi.
Is this, um...

13:42.589 --> 13:43.655
Are you Asian?

13:43.657 --> 13:44.989
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's great.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.658
Listen, my name is prince,

13:46.660 --> 13:49.594
and I work with an associate
of yours named Armando.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.262
I'm pretty sure he talked to you
about some stuff

13:51.264 --> 13:53.965
we were looking to unload.
-Yeah.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.100
-Okay, yeah, well,
he came down with something,

13:56.102 --> 13:59.037
and he asked us to take care
of this for him.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.106
Okay, so we are -- we're
holed up just outside of town

14:02.108 --> 14:04.943
at a hotel called...

14:04.945 --> 14:07.111
Le petit paradis.
-Hotel?

14:07.113 --> 14:08.546
-Mm-hmm.
That's right.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.982
They have a --
oh, they got a pool

14:10.984 --> 14:12.383
and, uh, like a breakfast,

14:12.385 --> 14:13.685
I think.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.053
-Tomorrow.
-Oh.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.556
Oh, okay.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.058
Yeah, he seemed chill.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.027
Wants us to call back tomorrow.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.197
-What's up with that voice?
-What voice?

14:45.985 --> 14:47.518
-What's going on?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.920
-What?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.788
-Where's Zack?

15:06.505 --> 15:07.872
Hey, man.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.073
You want a beer?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.776
-No, I'm good.

15:11.778 --> 15:16.547
-You ever been to Phoenix?
-I don't know. Where is it?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.450
-It's kind of far, I think.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.886
You know, that lottery
is up past $40 million.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.621
Might be worth a shot.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.457
Probably buy a lot of motor
homes for that kind of cash.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.894
-Uh-huh.

15:29.896 --> 15:33.731
-Well, I'm off
to find a legitimate job.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.600
-Good luck.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.443
<i> -The powerball lotto is up</i>
<i> to a whopping $44 million,</i>

15:45.445 --> 15:46.911
<i> if you can believe it.</i>

15:46.913 --> 15:48.479
<i>I've even bought a few tickets,</i>

15:48.481 --> 15:50.381
<i> and I'm thinking</i>
<i> of going back for more.</i>

15:50.383 --> 15:51.849
<i> What about you?</i>

15:56.055 --> 15:58.656
<i> -You bet.</i>

15:58.658 --> 16:03.061
<i> -So, you bought some,</i>
<i> or are you saying "you bet,"</i>

16:03.063 --> 16:04.829
<i> like I'm a gambler?</i>

16:04.831 --> 16:06.798
<i> Or are you saying you</i>
<i> don't believe I bought mine?</i>

16:08.735 --> 16:10.601
<i> You're not being</i>
<i> entirely clear here.</i>

16:10.603 --> 16:12.437
<i> What does that mean exactly,</i>

16:12.439 --> 16:14.339
<i> "you bet"?</i>

16:14.341 --> 16:17.809
- Zack!

16:17.811 --> 16:20.445
<i> -I think you just</i>
<i> don't understand.</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:22.447
<i> You see, I asked a question,</i>
<i> and you replied...</i>

16:38.030 --> 16:40.865
-Room, please.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.034
-$27.50.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.769
Sign here and here.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.281
In advance.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.558
-There's $30.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.682
Who's that?

17:31.684 --> 17:35.887
-Oh, that's lupita.
She works here.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.222
-Lupita.

17:38.224 --> 17:42.393
L-u-p-i-t-a.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.562
-I'm Zack -- z-a-c --

17:44.564 --> 17:46.397
-room 23.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.533
Down the hall, to your right.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.402
-Be staying long?
-Maybe.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.604
Tell me, did a couple
of African-American fellows

17:53.606 --> 17:54.872
like yourself check in recently?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.274
-Oh, yeah.
There are these two --

17:56.276 --> 17:58.876
-we can't give out
that kind of information.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.778
-Great.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.382
Room 23, down the hall?

18:04.384 --> 18:06.117
-Hope you enjoy your stay
at pe-tit paradis.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.487
Oh.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.126
-I don't trust that one either.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.528
-That ad is really working,
though, right?

18:19.698 --> 18:23.234
-20 bucks for those clubs.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.369
-That's what I told them.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.109
-Here's the trash.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.644
-The trash is supposed
to go out by the fence.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.556
-Hey, beautiful.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.493
Can I come in?

18:48.495 --> 18:49.727
-You're a liar.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.162
-A liar?
About what?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.131
-You don't own this hotel.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.600
-Well, I mean,
technically, it's my aunt's,

18:55.602 --> 18:56.834
but I never said --

18:56.836 --> 18:59.103
I mean, if she dies or anything,

18:59.105 --> 19:01.305
I'm the next of kin, so...

19:01.307 --> 19:02.440
I'd inherit it.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.008
-How much is it worth?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.443
-Not much.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.578
-You're pathologic,
just like my father.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.180
And I know
you're stealing money.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.281
-I'm not stealing.

19:10.283 --> 19:14.152
I'm -- I'm borrowing -- for us.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.820
<i> -You ever do one</i>
<i> of those office pools</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:17.355
<i> where everyone in the company</i>
<i> buys a ticket</i>

19:17.357 --> 19:19.223
<i> and then splits the winnings?</i>

19:21.126 --> 19:22.827
<i> -Nope.</i>

19:22.829 --> 19:26.097
<i> -Well, they're a real hoot.</i>

19:26.099 --> 19:28.699
<i> I'll tell you, you know,</i>
<i> we did one back in '95...</i>

19:28.701 --> 19:32.737
<i> ...when I was on wknrw.</i>

19:34.139 --> 19:35.706
- Hello?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.675
Yeah, they're here.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.343
Oh, sure, easy.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.546
I figure I could take them out,
be back before dark.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.683
Huh?

19:45.685 --> 19:49.120
I thought
this was the last of them.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.821
Well, I can, but I think
it's a waste of time.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.690
-What about <i> my</i> time?
-No, no, no, no, no.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.691
Your time is very valuable.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.426
I just thought --

19:58.697 --> 20:00.264
you're the boss.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.742
-Oh. Ahem.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.478
Fred left the trash by the door.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.083
Oh.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.560
<i> -...really don't care</i>
<i> about a pregnant panda.</i>

20:29.562 --> 20:32.096
<i> You want to know why?</i>
<i> I'll tell you anyway.</i>

20:32.098 --> 20:34.098
<i> Because...</i>
<i> With the amount of money</i>

20:34.100 --> 20:36.434
<i> I can win in this lottery</i>
<i> a few days from now,</i>

20:36.436 --> 20:40.004
<i> I can buy a whole pack</i>
<i>of pandas, or a clan of pandas,</i>

20:40.006 --> 20:43.908
<i> or whatever you call</i>
<i> a bunch of pandas.</i>

21:30.756 --> 21:33.658
-Pathologic.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.561
This whole damn thing's mine.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.572
Son of a bitch.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.918
- Ow!

22:00.920 --> 22:03.621
Motherfucker!

22:03.623 --> 22:04.989
What the hell, man?!

22:04.991 --> 22:07.458
-Don't throw rocks
in my pool, asshole!

22:07.460 --> 22:09.327
-Geez! Fine!

22:09.329 --> 22:11.929
Your aunt's pool anyway,
you fat prick.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.674
-Hey.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.042
Hey!

22:44.397 --> 22:46.197
Hey, what's happening, my man?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.798
-What's up with that room
you got us in?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.700
-Oh, the honeymoon suite.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.168
It's the bomb, right?

22:51.170 --> 22:54.538
-It's only got one bed.
-Right.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.907
That makes sense,
'cause it's for a honeymoon.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.143
-I look like
I'm on my honeymoon?

22:59.145 --> 23:00.678
-We'll get you another bed.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.979
-Them the clubs
you want me to use?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.848
-Oh, yeah.
They're a little dusty.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.550
But I'm gonna get 'em cleaned
up, and they'll be good as new.

23:06.552 --> 23:10.321
-And the phone ain't working.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.556
Shit ain't three stars.

23:17.529 --> 23:20.131
-The phones
might be back on tomorrow.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.390
-What?

24:19.392 --> 24:21.158
-Hey,
you know those two black guys?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.827
-No, I don't know
any black people.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.062
-Oh, well, I put them
in the honeymoon suite.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.165
-So? What?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.434
-Chad has a strange feeling
about them.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.937
-Yeah?
Well, I wouldn't trust Chad.

24:32.939 --> 24:36.240
Saw him stealing money
out of the register last night.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.675
-Well, he wants me
to keep an eye on them.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.076
Thinks they might be
drug dealers.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.478
-Yeah, maybe.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.279
-They like golf.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.181
Drug dealers golf?

24:48.119 --> 24:50.287
What's "Sarah's mix"?

24:50.289 --> 24:53.491
-Get out of my shit!

24:53.493 --> 24:55.326
-So, you gonna come?
-Yeah, whatever.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.661
I got to pick up my kid, though.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.363
-All right.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.432
-Yo, get up, man.

25:01.434 --> 25:03.133
We got to call him.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.602
-So call him.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.537
-You the one he knows.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.674
-Phones working,
they ain't working.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.976
Man, this place is janky.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.611
-Just agree to whatever he says,

25:13.613 --> 25:15.679
and don't talk
in that little-kid voice.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.847
Tell him 2:00.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.516
-Stand over there, man.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.417
You stress me out.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.700
Hello?
This is prince.

25:36.702 --> 25:41.171
Yes, hi. We wanted to set up
a time for tomorrow.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.507
We were thinking...

25:43.509 --> 25:46.677
2:00 in the lobby.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.179
Oh.
He Asian, too, right?

25:49.181 --> 25:51.649
-Hey. Money, money.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.552
So, did you and Armando
talk about the money?

25:54.554 --> 25:55.719
-Yes. $2,500.

25:55.721 --> 25:59.056
-$2,500?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.926
Actually,
we were thinking $3,000.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.427
You know, stuff came up.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.862
-Fine.
-Okay.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.263
All good.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.100
-I said agree with him.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.168
- I did.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.736
He was cool with $3,000.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.605
He's sending his nephew
tomorrow.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.341
-His nephew?
He say why?

26:17.343 --> 26:18.876
-Probably got better things
to do

26:18.878 --> 26:21.278
than hang out
in this nasty-ass desert motel.

26:23.214 --> 26:26.450
But it looks like we can hit up
that golf course after all.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.252
-What's wrong with you, man?

26:42.568 --> 26:46.403
-Shit.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.038
-Hello?
-Chad!

26:48.040 --> 26:49.139
-Hi, aunt Laura.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.808
-What's wrong with the phones?

26:50.810 --> 26:53.911
-No, what do you mean?

26:53.913 --> 26:56.280
Oh, that's weird.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.448
Yeah.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.917
I'll get right on that.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.819
Accounting books?
What for?

27:01.821 --> 27:03.120
No, totally.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.556
Yeah,
we keep really good records.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.427
Absolutely.
It's none of my business.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.430
Yeah, I'll get those to you
as soon as I can.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.265
Yeah, fresh one last night.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.667
He's in the freezer.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.435
He's a really big one.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.847
How long has this been out?

27:29.849 --> 27:31.682
-I told you they called.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.783
You pay the bill?

27:32.785 --> 27:34.852
-It was just on.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.520
We have accounting books?

27:36.522 --> 27:38.022
-On the shelf behind me.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.296
-Aren't these supposed to be in
a computer program or something?

27:46.298 --> 27:50.000
-You're the manager.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.704
-Why is he still here?
-He has no place to go.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.939
-I got a Hawaiian greaser
trying to steal my girlfriend,

27:55.941 --> 27:58.976
and he's feeding my cereal
to his Guinea pig.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.678
-That's a hamster.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.881
And if you think about it,
he's basically working for food.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.316
-Hamster ain't working.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.485
I bet those black guys
have money.

28:08.487 --> 28:09.853
-Why would you say that?

28:09.855 --> 28:11.321
-Come on.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.525
You ever heard
of black dudes playing golf?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.460
-Well, Tiger Woods plays golf.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.629
He's black, right?

28:18.631 --> 28:20.998
And then my uncle Leon.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.533
He played golf once. He's black.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.037
-Good morning.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.473
How was your sleep?
-Yeah, fine.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.475
So, what's the deal
with breakfast?

28:31.477 --> 28:32.743
-It's on the house.

28:32.745 --> 28:36.213
Come on, let's get you some.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.915
Here you go.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.752
One complimentary breakfast.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.387
One bowl per guest.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.924
You need anything else,
just let us know.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.759
-What's the story with lupita?

28:54.699 --> 28:56.934
-Keep an eye
on that son of a bitch.

28:56.936 --> 29:00.704
-I thought I was supposed
to watch those black guys golf.

29:00.706 --> 29:02.406
-Watch everything.

29:02.408 --> 29:06.376
-Fred, too?

29:06.378 --> 29:07.811
Paranoid fucker.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.426
-Hey, beautiful.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.396
Harmonica.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.900
It's kind of my trademark.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.869
Oh.

29:31.871 --> 29:35.205
Lottery ticket, huh?

29:35.207 --> 29:36.807
You know you're more likely
to get hit by lightning

29:36.809 --> 29:40.410
than win that thing?

29:40.412 --> 29:42.279
-Yes.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.684
-Adiós.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.439
-Good idea.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.009
What brothers
you know play golf?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.510
-Tiger Woods.
-Tiger Woods.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.312
That's one person.
Name another person.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.448
Name one other black golfer.
-Michael Jordan, man.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.951
-Michael Jordan lost a billion
dollars playing golf, man.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.187
Michael Jordan.

30:29.460 --> 30:33.030
- Nasty.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.401
-Excuse me, fellas.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.988
You guys are golfers, huh?

30:57.990 --> 30:59.857
-Yo, what up, bros?!

31:02.160 --> 31:03.827
-You get that mattress?

31:03.829 --> 31:06.396
-Things got crazy busy
last night, yo -- straight up.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.965
-Man, what's up
with these clubs, man?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.499
Said they'd be better
after you cleaned them.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.069
-Yeah, a lot
of that wouldn't come off.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.504
But, you know,
we're currently in the process

31:14.506 --> 31:16.039
of changing management,
so a lot of --

31:16.041 --> 31:18.709
-best be in the process
of getting me a mattress.

31:18.711 --> 31:21.011
-Yeah, and you might want
to check on gramps over there.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.247
He don't look too good.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.182
-The pool's gonna be ready soon.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.718
It's gonna be off the hook.
Mad bitches.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.654
And, you know, we're opening
a mobile branch of our motel,

31:30.656 --> 31:32.489
so get on our mailing list,

31:32.491 --> 31:35.659
and, you know, we'll keep you
apprised of things like that.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.494
Okay, peace out.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.165
-Changing management?

31:42.167 --> 31:43.867
Little dude got problems.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.969
-Yeah, he's not the only one.

31:48.373 --> 31:50.741
-Hey, did you say
we have an extra mattress?

31:50.743 --> 31:53.076
-Why?
You want to buy one?

31:53.078 --> 31:55.512
-No, they need one
in the honeymoon suite.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.147
-What are those guys up to?

32:04.389 --> 32:07.457
-Just in time for Christmas.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.159
-What the hell
does that even mean?

32:25.143 --> 32:28.045
-Hey, man.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.613
- Hey, brother.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.816
Come on.
-Okay.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.217
Yeah, hug it out.
-Love.

32:34.219 --> 32:37.254
-I know.
I feel it.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.422
I'm here to pick up Harry.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.823
-Yes.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.959
I love that little kid.
-I know you do.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.260
-He's so special, isn't he?

32:43.262 --> 32:45.929
-He's my child, so I'm aware.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.431
-Okay, I'm gonna pick him up
tomorrow afternoon.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.333
-Yep, cool.
-That's his safety seat.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.234
There's a change of clothes
in the backpack.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.502
Make sure he's in bed by 8:00.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.438
-Babe...
-What else? What else?

32:54.440 --> 32:55.906
-Tranquil.
-Yep, it's cool.

32:55.908 --> 32:57.574
We're just gonna get
some ice cream, hang out.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.476
-Hey, little man.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.677
Give us a handshake.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.746
One, two, three.
One, two.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.481
-Okay, that's enough of that.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.250
Let's go and have a conversation
about appropriate touching,

33:07.252 --> 33:09.686
'cause what he is doing
is not what should be.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.488
-I like your pants.

33:34.212 --> 33:35.979
-Good morning.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.281
Please see your receipts?

33:48.659 --> 33:51.995
All right.
You're all good.

33:51.997 --> 33:54.364
Did you get a copy
of the course rules?

33:54.366 --> 33:56.233
-No, man.
Didn't see that.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.101
-Please take one.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.840
It's everyone's responsibility
to know the rules.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.243
Okay?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.110
Have a good day, gentlemen.

34:59.464 --> 35:02.099
-Just think of this
as a 4-foot manhole.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.767
Try to get it close.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.403
Just back and through.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.271
Real smooth.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.984
You ever see a manhole before?

35:23.654 --> 35:25.655
- Oh.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.724
What are you up to?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.526
-Let me see those.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.499
They're just golfing.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.367
-Just stay down.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.305
-I still don't see
why we need to sell right away.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.275
I could have got them Asian
dudes up to $5,000 -- at least.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.945
-They were expecting to buy it
off of Armando for $2,500.

35:48.947 --> 35:52.315
You think they gonna just
double it, simple as that?

35:52.317 --> 35:54.918
Why do you want
to sell drugs, anyway?

35:54.920 --> 35:57.854
Why don't you go back to school,
be a doctor or something,

35:57.856 --> 36:00.757
instead of being out here
upholding the stereotypes?

36:00.759 --> 36:03.793
Except that outfit -- that's
definitely not a stereotype.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.562
I don't --
i don't know what that is.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.947
-Oh, shit!

36:23.949 --> 36:25.982
Something's happening.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.452
-Afternoon, gentlemen.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.188
Gonna need
to check your receipts.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.489
-Didn't you just check us?

36:32.491 --> 36:34.324
-At the first tee?

36:34.326 --> 36:36.626
-Look, kanye, I'm not here
to argue with you.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.495
I'm here to do a job.
-Kanye?

36:38.497 --> 36:40.063
-Looks like you got
one set of clubs there.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.734
Gonna have to write you
a warning for sharing clubs.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.303
-What's wrong with sharing?

36:46.305 --> 36:49.306
-Every golfer has to have
their own set of clubs.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.907
It's course policy.
It's in the rules.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.409
I gave you the rules.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.311
-This power done gone
to your head, little man.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.413
-Wait, wait.
How much that cost?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.650
-Nothing.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.852
They don't let me
write citations.

37:02.854 --> 37:06.690
-Would it just be easier for you
to just warn us, like, verbally?

37:06.692 --> 37:08.925
-Look, q-tip,
this isn't the hood, okay?

37:08.927 --> 37:10.860
Not gonna get off that easy.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.897
Not today.
Not on my turf.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.099
-He's writing something.

37:16.101 --> 37:19.569
Maybe it's a check
or a prescription.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.972
-Hey, is that the guy
from the motel?

37:25.409 --> 37:28.445
-Oh, shit!
Get down!

37:28.447 --> 37:30.313
-Where's Harry?

37:33.284 --> 37:36.219
-What the...

37:36.221 --> 37:38.622
-Name.
-John Wayne.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.890
-John...Wayne.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.792
W-a-y...
-Get back here.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.527
Come on! Harry!

37:48.266 --> 37:49.599
-Lesson learned.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.468
Have a good day, Mr. Wayne.

37:53.571 --> 37:54.871
-Hey, did you see that kid

37:54.873 --> 37:59.109
standing over there
a second ago?

37:59.111 --> 38:00.910
-What are you talking about?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.345
Here.

38:07.885 --> 38:10.420
-John Wayne.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.589
More like Lil Wayne.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.125
-Why's the guy from 23 here?

38:15.127 --> 38:18.128
Maybe Chad was right.
-I don't know.

38:18.130 --> 38:21.097
There's got to be some way
for us to cash in on this.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.632
-Cash in on what?

38:22.634 --> 38:23.900
From him?

38:25.903 --> 38:27.737
-You were right --
this thing is much bigger

38:27.739 --> 38:28.738
than the two africans.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.273
-Of course it is.
-Yeah.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.508
No, I know, I know, I know.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.842
I'm saying that you're right.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.411
You <i> were</i> right.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.414
Yeah, all right, well...

38:37.416 --> 38:39.249
Prick.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.693
-Do you think that creepy guy
in the golf cart was a mule?

39:23.695 --> 39:24.894
Whoa!
You brought a gun?!

39:24.896 --> 39:25.995
-Of course I brought a gun.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.997
I'm babysitting.
Hey, buddy.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.400
We don't tell your mom
about this kind of stuff, okay?

39:59.864 --> 40:02.098
-Why are you in my room?

40:05.503 --> 40:07.303
-Come.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.041
This is your room.

40:12.043 --> 40:16.513
<i>-All these come with a four-day</i>
<i> limited money-back guarantee.</i>

40:16.515 --> 40:19.048
-You want to watch TV with us?

40:19.050 --> 40:21.217
<i> -To order, you can call</i>
<i> the toll-free number</i>

40:21.219 --> 40:24.120

40:28.926 --> 40:30.627
-You like it here?

40:33.364 --> 40:36.266
-I miss my brother.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.802
I send him money.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.004
-I guess he appreciates it.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.650
-I think you're supposed
to use chlorine. That's bleach.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.922
-Is that bleach?

40:58.924 --> 41:00.790
-Do it yourself, then.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.595
-He's got to be in on it.
-On what?

41:05.597 --> 41:07.397
-Come on, let's go.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.336
How's it going?

41:13.338 --> 41:14.671
-Good.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.805
Real good.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.574
How you fellas?

41:21.446 --> 41:23.213
-You in a jug band or something?

41:28.819 --> 41:31.254
Security cameras.
-For what?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.089
-Find out
what's going on around here.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.192
This could be our ticket out.
Come on.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.327
-Wait, what?

41:37.329 --> 41:38.628
What ticket? Where?

41:40.098 --> 41:42.365
Oh, shit.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.834
-You get that bed?
-Almost ready.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.437
-What, are you having them
custom-made or something?

41:47.439 --> 41:49.472
-How did the clubs
work out for you?

41:49.474 --> 41:50.974
-Things are dangerous.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.876
The head flew off of this one.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.744
-Oh, great.

41:57.815 --> 41:59.349
-What are you doing?
-Jesus.

41:59.351 --> 42:00.483
Nothing.

42:00.485 --> 42:04.153
Nothing.
Just fixing the books.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.388
What?

42:05.390 --> 42:07.156
-Did you get the mattress?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.491
-What mattress?

42:08.493 --> 42:09.993
-The one
for the honeymoon suite.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.461
-Oh!

42:11.463 --> 42:13.763
Jesus, I got to do everything
around here.

42:19.336 --> 42:22.672
-You think that little dude
at the desk is retarded?

42:22.674 --> 42:26.643
-Maybe he got asperger.
-What's that?

42:26.645 --> 42:29.746
-It's when you act
all messed up.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.147
-He definitely got it, then.

42:33.217 --> 42:37.320
-Me...Llamo.

42:37.322 --> 42:40.189
Me...Llamo...

42:40.191 --> 42:41.558
Ken.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.560
<i> -Maybe stay inside</i>
<i> with the missus.</i>

42:43.562 --> 42:47.230
-Es me llamo.
<i> -Watch a romantic movie.</i>

42:47.232 --> 42:48.831
-Ken.

42:48.833 --> 42:52.735
Me llamo es Ken.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.938
-What about
this crazy penguin guy?

42:54.940 --> 42:56.873
You used to love him.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.242
Huh? All right.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.877
How about Teddy bear?
What does he do?

43:00.879 --> 43:02.712
Is he fun?

43:02.714 --> 43:05.014
Nothing?

43:17.361 --> 43:20.029
That's amazing.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.698
Hey.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.800
Nothing.
Just hanging out with my kid.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.202
Did you find it?

43:26.204 --> 43:27.637
All right.
Well, keep looking.

43:27.639 --> 43:29.772
There's got to be someplace
that sells them.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.975
-Ugh!

43:31.977 --> 43:33.776
I have to do everything
around here.

43:39.416 --> 43:40.783
-Bubble wrap, huh?

43:43.587 --> 43:44.921
What do you think about Phoenix?

43:46.925 --> 43:48.424
Yeah. Me too.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.374
Phew.

44:15.152 --> 44:17.687
-Yes?
-Hola.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.796
Um...

44:59.798 --> 45:01.364
Uh...

45:34.932 --> 45:37.066
-In the secret business,
are you the boss?

45:37.068 --> 45:39.168
-Yeah.
Yeah, pretty much.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.771
I mean, I'd say I'm my own boss.

45:41.773 --> 45:43.306
-We'll talk tomorrow.

45:52.516 --> 45:53.850
Hey, pal.
How's it going?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.242
Ah.

46:19.244 --> 46:20.943
How you doing, old-timer?

46:24.281 --> 46:26.149
Nice rat.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.752
Oh, boy.

46:29.754 --> 46:33.656
One of those days, huh?
I hear you.

46:33.658 --> 46:37.794
You know, sometimes, I just
want to say to hell with it.

46:37.796 --> 46:39.095
Am I right?

46:40.598 --> 46:43.766
You know, a man
reaches a point in his life

46:43.768 --> 46:47.436
when he realizes
there's more to it than work.

46:47.438 --> 46:49.238
You know, maybe...

46:49.240 --> 46:50.840
Maybe a family.

46:53.944 --> 46:55.244
-Everything's okay.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.979
Just go to your happy place.

47:12.130 --> 47:15.698
-You really love that old rat,
don't you?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.668
-How's that?

47:18.670 --> 47:22.672
-That's what it's all about,
isn't it?

47:22.674 --> 47:24.740
Love.

47:28.111 --> 47:30.479
You know what?

47:30.481 --> 47:32.815
You're all right, old-timer.

47:32.817 --> 47:36.586
You need anything at all,
don't hesitate, okay?

47:58.876 --> 48:01.344
-Yes?

48:01.346 --> 48:03.646
Is there something
i can help you with?

48:03.648 --> 48:05.047
-I brought this for...

48:18.663 --> 48:20.196
Hello?

48:20.198 --> 48:22.365
Hi, aunt Laura.
Yeah, no.

48:22.367 --> 48:25.268
No, I wasn't asleep. I was
just painting and fixing stuff.

48:25.270 --> 48:28.404
-You have my damn books?
-The accounting books, yeah.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.039
Yeah, those are good to go.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.441
I'll just -- I'll bring
those by later on tonight.

48:32.443 --> 48:35.077
-Now.
-Or now is good, too.

48:35.079 --> 48:36.545
-You get that mouse for me?

48:36.547 --> 48:37.947
-Yeah, I got your mouse.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.082
-You better.
If you don't, it's your ass.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.118
-I got to go.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.691
Hey!

48:48.693 --> 48:51.460
This is private property!

48:51.462 --> 48:54.196
Wait.

48:54.198 --> 48:56.432
Wait up for me.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.967
Come on.

49:29.266 --> 49:31.133
Where's my mouse?

49:31.135 --> 49:32.768
-I threw it away.

49:32.770 --> 49:34.570
-Fuck!

50:30.627 --> 50:33.329
-Well, cereal
falls into the grain category

50:33.331 --> 50:34.964
in the food pyramid.

50:34.966 --> 50:37.666
And for the longest time,
cheese was different than dairy.

50:37.668 --> 50:40.069
They changed that, though.

50:41.906 --> 50:44.974
-Okay. So, this guy
is supposed to be the best.

50:44.976 --> 50:46.876
-All right.

50:46.878 --> 50:48.377
I feel weird about bringing him.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.246
Is it gonna be safe?

50:53.850 --> 50:55.718
You okay, buddy?

51:02.659 --> 51:04.427
-Bed's here.

51:04.429 --> 51:06.295
Smell like cat piss.

51:14.871 --> 51:18.407
-He dead?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.876
-I think he's sleeping.

51:20.878 --> 51:22.244
-Damn.

51:22.246 --> 51:26.615
Poor motherfucker
got a sock for a pet.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.551
-Yo, gramps...

51:28.553 --> 51:30.886
You all right?

51:30.888 --> 51:33.322
-Y-yes, sir.
Yes, sir, right away.

51:42.065 --> 51:43.766
-I'm gonna catch some sun.

52:08.992 --> 52:10.559
What the...

52:17.634 --> 52:21.804
- Baby.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.405
-Aunt Laura.

52:23.407 --> 52:25.107
Hey, who <i> is</i> this guy?

52:25.109 --> 52:27.610
-That's Jean-Paul.

52:27.612 --> 52:29.445
You bring my mouse, fat boy?

52:29.447 --> 52:31.814
-Uh, I got you
something different.

52:37.487 --> 52:39.588
-What the hell is that?
-A hamster.

52:39.590 --> 52:42.091
-I know it's a hamster,
you dumb son of a bitch.

52:42.093 --> 52:43.692
Why did you bring it
into my house?

52:43.694 --> 52:46.428
-I just thought the snake
might want a little variety.

52:46.430 --> 52:47.763
And he's alive.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.932
-What you think, j.P.?
You like variety?

52:51.335 --> 52:52.801
-Dirty son of a bitch.

52:55.606 --> 52:57.806
Okay, doughboy, give it here.
-Hey.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.308
Hey, you never told me
who this guy is.

52:59.310 --> 53:01.610
He's been creeping
around the motel,

53:01.612 --> 53:03.979
messing with the phones.
-Jean-Paul!

53:03.981 --> 53:05.681
-Yeah, I know.
She said that already, okay?

53:05.683 --> 53:07.483
Just let the adults talk
for a second.

53:07.485 --> 53:11.453
-He's a private investigator,
specializes in real estate.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.822
-Why would you hire
an investigator?

53:13.824 --> 53:16.692
-I didn't <i> hire</i> him.
I'm <i> fucking</i> him.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.829
-Did you bring the money books?

53:20.831 --> 53:24.200
-Yeah. I'm still working on most
of them, but that one's done.

53:27.504 --> 53:29.171
-You stealing from me,
butterball?

53:29.173 --> 53:30.506
-Stealing?
No. Why?

53:30.508 --> 53:32.474
-'Cause if I find out you are,

53:32.476 --> 53:34.376
j.P. Will eat your nuts
for lunch.

53:35.479 --> 53:37.012
-He also tells me the numbers

53:37.014 --> 53:38.581
should be inside a computer.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.182
Shouldn't take you
more than five minutes

53:40.184 --> 53:42.418
to add them up.
-Yeah -- well, yeah.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.820
I told Zack
to get on that, you know,

53:44.822 --> 53:46.989
but you know how he is.

53:46.991 --> 53:48.090
-No.

53:48.092 --> 53:52.194
How is he?
-Absent-minded?

53:52.196 --> 53:55.898
-Just because your daddy was in
the habit of putting his pecker

53:55.900 --> 53:59.201
into nasty old holes,
and one of them was my sister's,

53:59.203 --> 54:00.736
don't make us family.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.404
I find out
you're up to something,

54:02.406 --> 54:05.007
I will throw your fat ass
out on the street

54:05.009 --> 54:08.410
fast as you can say
the word "doughnut."

54:08.412 --> 54:10.079
You got it?
-Yeah, got it.

54:10.081 --> 54:11.947
-Then go get
the books I asked for

54:11.949 --> 54:13.682
and quit acting like a pussy!

54:17.454 --> 54:19.722
And don't bring me
no more fucking hamsters

54:19.724 --> 54:21.690
when I ask for mice!

54:24.894 --> 54:27.763
Retarded son of a bitch.

54:27.765 --> 54:30.199
-"Pecker in a nasty hole."

54:30.201 --> 54:31.834
Don't need this shit.

54:55.158 --> 54:57.326
-Yo, I wouldn't touch
that water, man.

54:57.328 --> 54:58.994
Mess around
and get herpes or something.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.797
-Uh-huh.
I'll see you out there.

55:05.802 --> 55:09.071
Cup, cup, cup.

55:09.073 --> 55:10.906
Ugh.

55:10.908 --> 55:13.008
Uh-huh.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.410
Hmm?

55:32.762 --> 55:34.797
-Change your mind?
-I forgot something.

56:10.634 --> 56:12.134
-Is this it?

56:16.306 --> 56:17.806
-It's the right address.

56:24.681 --> 56:27.249
Hello?

56:27.251 --> 56:29.385
-Maybe he went out to lunch.
-Yeah.

56:29.387 --> 56:31.787
And maybe he's drowning
in meth fumes.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.327
-Hello?!

56:38.329 --> 56:40.362
- Can I help you?

56:40.364 --> 56:41.864
-Jesus.

56:41.866 --> 56:44.533
Scared us.
Didn't see you there.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.001
-Precisely.

56:46.003 --> 56:49.872
You saw nothing, while I,
in turn, saw everything.

56:49.874 --> 56:52.875
Now the information
is collected.

56:52.877 --> 56:54.777
-What information?

56:57.247 --> 57:01.550
-Oh. Does the little fighter
want a lolly?

57:01.552 --> 57:02.918
Oh.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.953
-Okay, I will hold on to that.

57:04.955 --> 57:07.423
-So, what can Klaus do for you?

57:07.425 --> 57:08.957
-Looking for a hidden camera.

57:08.959 --> 57:12.561
- Aha.
Someone wants to do some spying?

57:14.298 --> 57:16.298
I used to do
a bit of spying myself.

57:18.469 --> 57:21.069
But then there was
some commotion.

57:21.071 --> 57:23.539
I can no longer
go near the playground.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.374
-Okay, stay real close to me.

57:28.812 --> 57:31.380
-Excuse me, no.
This is Klaus' house, so...

57:36.586 --> 57:38.787
- Is he bavarian?

57:38.789 --> 57:41.723
-I don't know.
Is that in Phoenix?

57:41.725 --> 57:44.993
- It's in Europe!

57:49.933 --> 57:52.601
-This, I think, will be best.

57:52.603 --> 57:55.437
Look, he has a camera,
keeping eyes on you.

57:55.439 --> 57:56.605
-Okay, we'll take it.

57:56.607 --> 57:58.907
- Donation, please.

57:58.909 --> 58:01.343
You have any cash?
-No.

58:01.345 --> 58:05.481
-You never have any cash --
i pay for everything!

58:05.483 --> 58:06.949
Here.

58:06.951 --> 58:08.116
-You don't have any Euros?

58:08.118 --> 58:10.085
-I have $20 American.

58:12.121 --> 58:13.956
Thank you.

58:13.958 --> 58:15.357
-Enjoy your lolly,
little fighter.

58:15.359 --> 58:16.959
-Don't talk to him.

58:16.961 --> 58:19.862
-Bye-bye.

58:23.934 --> 58:25.367
<i> -Yes, the accounting</i>

58:25.369 --> 58:27.603
<i> and the office pool</i>
<i> back in '95...</i>

58:27.605 --> 58:30.606
-Lose something?

58:30.608 --> 58:32.040
-It was leaking.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.809
-Leaking what?
-Not sure.

58:33.811 --> 58:36.211
That's what I'm up here
checking on.

58:36.213 --> 58:39.348
-Need some help?
-No, I'm good.

58:39.350 --> 58:40.649
Thank you.

58:40.651 --> 58:44.019
-Mordechai and me
are heading to the pool.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.488
-Yeah. Okay.

58:46.490 --> 58:50.225
O-okay.

58:50.227 --> 58:52.628
Man.

58:54.197 --> 58:57.599
-One of them newlyweds
is up in the roof.

59:08.011 --> 59:09.811
-Oh. Sorry.

59:12.916 --> 59:14.917
<i> -Let's move on</i>
<i> to some sporting news.</i>

59:14.919 --> 59:19.054
<i> What's new</i>
<i> in the world of sports?</i>

59:23.860 --> 59:26.261
<i> Give it to me straight.</i>
<i> What about baseball?</i>

59:26.263 --> 59:27.996
-Damn it.
<i> -Are we winning?</i>

59:32.902 --> 59:35.871
-Let's go, you sicko.

59:35.873 --> 59:39.741
-Time to meet your maker, fella.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.276
-Hold it!
-Whoa!

59:41.278 --> 59:43.545
-Drop the hamster!
-That's what I was gonna do.

59:43.547 --> 59:45.047
-No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Hold it.

59:45.049 --> 59:47.883
-Which is it --
hold it or drop it?

59:47.885 --> 59:49.217
-Uh...

59:49.219 --> 59:51.720
Just...

59:51.722 --> 59:53.355
Give him here, okay?

59:55.758 --> 59:57.426
All right, all right.

59:57.428 --> 01:00:01.730
Now, who's gonna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.398
-Well, right now,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.401
you're pointing a gun at me
and holding my hamster,

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.704
and I am about to get upset.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:11.940
-Why's the dirty guy from the
motel stealing hamsters for you?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.875
-I knew something like this
would happen.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.477
Dumb bastard.

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:17.145
-So, what is it?

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.947
Selling 'em, huh?

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.248
Eating 'em? What?

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.417
-J.P. And I are vegetarians.

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:25.554
-You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:27.155
He's helpless.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.626
Ain't right.

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.761
-Some help you are.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.563
-He jumped me.

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:36.865
- The world's gone to hell.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:44.973
-How long he been in there?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.408
-A few minutes.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.843
-He say anything?

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:49.578
-What's he supposed to say?

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.680
-You know, I don't think
he should be in there.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:54.716
That motherfucker's
on borrowed time anyway.

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:06.962
-Hey, how are we gonna hide

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:08.497
a Teddy bear
in the honeymoon suite?

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.199
-Make sure your mom
gets these, okay?

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:13.969
Super-important.

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:17.839
And these slurpees
never happened, all right?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.242
Come on. Let's teach you
how to shoot a gun.

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.952
Arm straight.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:33.622
Slightly bend the knees.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:35.957
Relax the neck.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:38.226
Find your target.

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.661
Aim.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:43.331
Pull the trigger.

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:44.433
-Did I hit it?

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.516
<i> -That's sports for now.</i>

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:04.586
<i> What about that panda?</i>
<i> Any news there?</i>

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:05.754
<i> -Yep.</i>

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.495
-What up, bros?

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.197
Pretty sweet pool, huh?

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:17.866
-My aunt had a blow-up pool
better than this.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:20.168
And she was a crackhead.
-Mm.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.370
-Yeah, you might want
to check on the old man.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.172
Dude hasn't moved in a while.

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:26.908
-And that mattress
smell like cat piss.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.577
-Okay.
Can I speak to you for a minute?

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.479
Stay here.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.686
Okay, I'm gonna
go to their room,

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:39.087
find a place
to put the Teddy-cam.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.255
You keep an eye on him, okay?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.590
-What do I tell them?

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.492
-Charm them.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.564
-That kid play golf?

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:51.967
-No.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.902
It's a pretty nice day,
though, huh?

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.237
-He got asperger?

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:57.606
-No, he doesn't have ass-- what?

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.908
-A lot of them wear funny
helmets and shit like that.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:02.043
-This is a world war ii helmet.

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:05.113
It's a collector's item.
-If you say so.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:06.848
Look like asperger to me.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:14.422
Hey.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:16.892
What's going on?
-I was cleaning.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.794
-Up there?

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:20.562
-It was dirty.
-That's cool.

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:23.632
Uh, Chad asked me
to make the bed, 'cause...

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.467
He didn't do it.

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:43.485
-Where's Chris?

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.353
-I don't know.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.526
-It's like a motor home with
all the amenities of a motel,

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.663
but instead of you going to it,
it comes to you.

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.364
-We look homeless?
-No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.633
It's for, like, if you want
to travel under the radar.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.936
You know -- incognito.
-Incog-what?

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:03.138
-Well, you know, it's
all in the way you market it.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.540
-Hey, sweetie.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:06.541
What are you wearing?

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:07.843
Why is he in a helmet?

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.444
-That's actually
a world war ii helmet.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:12.214
-Where's Chris?
-He had something he had to do.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.815
-He got asperger?

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.517
-Dude, I already told you,
he does not have asp--

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.553
-okay, come on, sweetie.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:19.955
-Sarah,
he's actually coming back,

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:21.389
so if you just want
to wait for him...

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.425
-I think it's gonna rain.

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.362
-Man, these people are crazy.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.669
-Sarah, Sarah! Wait!

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.571

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.183
<i> -I am attracted</i>
<i> to these little things.</i>

-They Asian.

-They southeast Asian?
Korean? Japanese?

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:12.941
India's Asian.
They could be Indians.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.710
-They're not Indian, man.
They just regular.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:17.045

Oh.

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.027
Oh!

01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:33.395
How much
do you think it's worth?

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:34.729
-A few thousand.
Maybe more.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.064
Enough to get Sarah back.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:37.132
-Buy the motor home!

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.667
-Let's get the guns.

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.625
-The books.

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.811
Why are
all these Chinese people here?

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:25.146

-Uh...

-You the asians?

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.289

No, no, no. Just one.
Y'all wait here.

Grab some cereal or something.

-Something

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:58.380
-Why?
Are you the waiter?

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.817
-Breakfast is complimentary

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:05.153
-Oh, this is a hotel?

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.821
Have you ever been to a hotel?

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:08.523
-You got some eggs or something?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.959
-No, we need bacon.

01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:12.293

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:29.978
-Outside.

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:36.384
This is a professional place
of business.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.209
Milk costs money.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.578
I pay for all that.
-Drop it!

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.281
-Whoa.
M-man, it's just a bb gun.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:07.549

-Awesome.

-Why did you steal him?

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.459
- How did you get that?

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:18.926
Oh, I'm shot!

Oh, thank god.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:24.866

-I don't think so.

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:37.377
-Well, then
how would they know we have it?

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.982
-They don't,
but they saw my kid and my wife.

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:45.120
-Look, we just need to chill
for a minute, gather ourselves.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.822
- I can't take any chances.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:50.925
Okay, it's loaded,

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:54.095
Give me your keys.

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.897
Okay, I'm gonna pull the car
