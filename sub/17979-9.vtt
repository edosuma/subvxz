<i>It's a scorcher out there, folks.</i>

01:02.943 --> 01:05.075
<i>According to
the National Weather Service,</i>

01:05.110 --> 01:07.323
<i>we won't get released from
the triple-digit heat</i>

01:07.371 --> 01:09.760
<i>until sometime early next week.</i>

01:09.795 --> 01:13.152
You boys are ready? Okay,
let's get that camera on set.

01:16.563 --> 01:18.182
Did you load the 500T?

01:23.098 --> 01:26.102
It gets against rules to make us work
under this kind of heat.

01:29.535 --> 01:32.105
- Try to stay hydrated.
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

01:34.021 --> 01:34.951
Water?

01:38.925 --> 01:40.330
He has what?

01:40.362 --> 01:42.876
- Uh, it's an Elmo.
- A what?

01:42.901 --> 01:44.413
An Elmo tattoo.

01:44.460 --> 01:47.186
What grown man gets
Elmo tattooed on his ass?

01:47.219 --> 01:48.782
How long is it gonna take to cover?

01:48.828 --> 01:51.733
You know, in this heat, it's hard
to get the makeup to ??? to his butt chicks.

01:51.825 --> 01:54.222
- It's all running down his crack.
- Oh, look.

01:54.256 --> 01:57.022
Maybe the character would have
an Elmo ass tattooed.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.153
- And then we wont have to cover it.
- No.

01:59.195 --> 02:00.790
- No.
- Alright.

02:08.764 --> 02:12.440
Okay, here we go. Let's lock it up.
And...

02:12.485 --> 02:14.080
Roll sound, please.

02:15.216 --> 02:17.883
69, take 1. Mark.

02:23.916 --> 02:25.063
And...

02:25.918 --> 02:27.443
action!

02:27.488 --> 02:29.351
- What's going on?
- What?

02:29.456 --> 02:32.933
- Come on!
- What is... What the fuck is this?

02:33.115 --> 02:35.862
I think, I think we're having
a power failure.

02:35.908 --> 02:37.743
- What?
- Shit!

02:37.788 --> 02:39.921
Shit, shit, shit!

03:43.467 --> 03:45.310
- Back on, back on.
- Okay.

03:46.505 --> 03:48.282
Okay. Listen up, everybody.

03:48.326 --> 03:51.271
So Cal Edison is doing
the rolling blackouts again.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.771
So let's shoot while we can.

03:52.808 --> 03:54.473
Let's have fun, all squeeze!

03:56.325 --> 03:57.840
Alright, you heard her.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.110
You want a blast?

04:13.157 --> 04:15.390
Yeah, please. Thank you.

04:18.346 --> 04:20.253
Apparently this is earthquake weather.

04:21.005 --> 04:22.800
Go ahead, bitch, bring it on.

04:24.537 --> 04:27.081
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'll get over it.

04:28.498 --> 04:31.563
- Thank you.
- 69, take 2. Mark.

04:34.638 --> 04:36.302
And action.

04:58.248 --> 05:00.852
Okay. Cut, cut, cut.

05:00.896 --> 05:02.383
Hey, you guys?

05:02.428 --> 05:05.772
It's actually... that's not...
That's not the scene.

05:05.818 --> 05:09.071
Okay? This is an obligatory fuck.
You don't wanna fuck him.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.960
You don't like
having sex with this guy, okay?

05:13.005 --> 05:15.371
Okay, but... I mean,

05:15.407 --> 05:17.961
he's been my boyfriend
for like three years, right? I mean,

05:18.006 --> 05:19.932
why would I hate
having sex with him now?

05:19.935 --> 05:23.732
- Yes. That's what I was kinda thinking too.
- Thanks, Fallon, I got this.

05:23.777 --> 05:27.040
'Cause you're in love with Karina,
okay?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.891
You probably don't like
having sex with that guy.

05:29.905 --> 05:33.471
Just because I like women doesn't mean
I have to hate men. I mean,

05:33.507 --> 05:36.153
come on, Jenny,
is this a man-hating movie?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.363
It's not a man-hating film,

05:39.396 --> 05:42.122
but the scene as written

05:42.157 --> 05:45.232
is about the experience
of being force to have sex

05:45.268 --> 05:46.902
with this guy,

05:46.937 --> 05:51.342
when the night before, you've just had
the most beautiful, mind-blowing sex.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.733
With a woman.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.851
Now this

05:54.898 --> 05:58.531
hairy guy is just pounding you,
like unh unh unh...

05:59.408 --> 06:02.483
What does that do? It hurts.
You want to cry.

06:04.507 --> 06:06.031
Is that okay with you?

06:06.065 --> 06:07.911
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

06:07.957 --> 06:11.141
Its that okay? Thanks.
Thanks.

06:11.175 --> 06:13.110
Alright, let's go now.

06:13.148 --> 06:16.210
Very good then.
Let's lock it up, please.

06:16.248 --> 06:19.243
- And roll sound.
- So to speak.

06:19.566 --> 06:20.873
Thanks.

06:20.907 --> 06:23.090
Shhh. Settle, settle.

06:23.127 --> 06:25.613
69, take 3. Mark.

06:27.158 --> 06:28.230
Action.

06:55.767 --> 06:58.173
Okay. Cut, cut.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.410
Okay, it looks like
you love fucking this guy.

07:00.448 --> 07:02.541
You don't like fucking him, okay?

07:02.575 --> 07:04.561
Do you understand that?

07:05.585 --> 07:07.062
Hang on a sec.

07:07.108 --> 07:08.783
Look at me.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.192
Did you fuck him?

07:25.766 --> 07:28.330
Can I have my uh... Can we just...

07:28.908 --> 07:31.562
lock it up? Thanks.

07:34.578 --> 07:36.572
Listen to me, okay?

07:36.615 --> 07:37.810
Please.

07:37.855 --> 07:39.442
I was drunk, it was after the party.

07:39.477 --> 07:41.560
It meant nothing, okay?
It was a mistake.

07:41.637 --> 07:42.931
I understand.

07:42.976 --> 07:45.362
- You feel pressured.
- I mean, they're pressuring me,

07:45.395 --> 07:48.180
and they're making their scene
in a heterosexual sex M.O. now,

07:48.216 --> 07:50.450
and I swear to God, Jenny,
I wish it was you

07:50.496 --> 07:52.441
and I'm so sorry,
and I will never do it again.

07:52.485 --> 07:55.001
Thanks. Can I just, uh,

07:55.046 --> 07:56.650
a minute

07:56.696 --> 07:58.011
with him?

07:58.057 --> 07:59.281
Thanks.

07:59.318 --> 08:02.292
Hey, Fallon?
Can I just talk to you for a sec?

08:02.338 --> 08:04.480
- Yeah, yeah. What? What is it?
- Hey.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.463
I just wanted to talk to you
about fucking your co-star.

08:11.495 --> 08:13.911
Do you realize how irresponsible

08:13.927 --> 08:16.413
- and destructive that is?
- I didn't think it was...

08:16.446 --> 08:19.311
It's unprofessional, okay?

08:19.357 --> 08:21.983
You've tampered with the chemestry

08:22.018 --> 08:23.433
between the two of you.

08:23.478 --> 08:25.382
It is a vile

08:25.425 --> 08:27.293
and despicable act.

08:27.336 --> 08:28.411
Alright?

08:29.446 --> 08:30.652
You're fired.

08:32.398 --> 08:34.500
- What?
- Get outta here.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.653
- With this fucking black, I can't...
- Get the fuck out of my set.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.370
Fuck this shit!

08:42.837 --> 08:45.802
So, I called Joey Manhohand,
I said "Go ahead,

08:45.835 --> 08:47.363
take us to Court,

08:47.426 --> 08:49.791
'cause you've got
a final bust offer on the table.

08:49.827 --> 08:52.851
And no judge in California
is gonna let you walk away with anything,

08:52.886 --> 08:54.611
like we were stipulating.

08:54.657 --> 08:56.361
You're gonna take one look
at your client,

08:56.395 --> 08:58.203
and you're gonna say,

08:59.567 --> 09:01.540
"Put your socks, old man,

09:01.578 --> 09:03.060
go back to work.

09:03.096 --> 09:06.321
- Stop wighting like a girl".
- Wighting like a girl.

09:06.358 --> 09:08.990
Leonard always wighted like a girl.

09:09.045 --> 09:11.841
- What did Joey say?
- He caved.

09:12.555 --> 09:15.913
- Yes.
- Oh, it made him sweat like a pig.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.770
Even more than I'm sweating right now
in this blasted heat.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.423
And we should have documents
to sign tomorrow.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.410
I'd love Molly to meet you. She's having
second thoughts about law school.

09:25.455 --> 09:29.012
- She wants to take a semester off.
- I thought Molly was on Leonard's camp.

09:29.205 --> 09:33.090
She's just so angry. You would be
such an inspiration for her.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.530
If you and I were still... I mean, if I

09:40.576 --> 09:43.333
- hadn't been so foolish...
- Oh, you made your choice.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.940
- I accepted it. Didn't I?
- Yeah.

09:45.976 --> 09:49.622
You gave me my space to run around
like a crazy adolescent.

09:50.905 --> 09:52.911
Okay, Phyllis. I want you to listen to me.

09:57.965 --> 10:02.620
It's understandable, given that
we've just had this little triumph together,

10:02.667 --> 10:05.363
and given how smoldering hot

10:05.395 --> 10:07.400
the two of us were in the sack...

10:07.437 --> 10:09.453
It's understandable
that you might be feeling

10:09.498 --> 10:11.842
a tiny bit amorous towards me right now.

10:12.575 --> 10:15.221
I'm just trying to stand by my convictions
here, m'dear.

10:16.088 --> 10:19.090
But you are making it awfully difficult
in that sweet

10:19.836 --> 10:21.550
little slip of a frock.

10:22.887 --> 10:24.600
Sweetie...

10:24.642 --> 10:26.746
Joyce...

10:26.781 --> 10:29.213
You're sitting on my shirt.

10:30.090 --> 10:32.566
- What?
- You're sitting on my shirt.

10:36.629 --> 10:38.201
Let it go.

10:41.588 --> 10:43.491
This is it.

10:47.317 --> 10:51.143
I had to fight some old snooty woman
at the Bodega for the last of it,

10:51.188 --> 10:53.593
but I got it! Yes!

10:53.638 --> 10:58.260
This hot-ass earthquake weather, man,
just makes people mean. Just meeeean.

10:58.306 --> 11:00.073
Hey Kit, are you going to that, uh,

11:00.115 --> 11:03.080
- sit-down anything?
- I don't know. You know,

11:03.565 --> 11:07.110
I don't trust 'em.
I do not trust those SheBar bitches

11:07.145 --> 11:09.790
coming up in here
with some ol' mobster crap.

11:09.826 --> 11:11.592
I mean, let me read this to you:

11:11.597 --> 11:14.830
"We request your presence at a sit-down

11:14.875 --> 11:18.001
to mediate grievances and lesbo turf.

11:18.037 --> 11:21.143
At the SheBar. Lunch will be served".
Are these bitches crazy?

11:21.188 --> 11:23.141
Alright. I know. Oh, thanks.

11:23.176 --> 11:25.280
And everyone got one of those.
Me too.

11:25.328 --> 11:27.191
I met 'em once, when I was stoned.

11:27.296 --> 11:28.783
Why do they want you to go?

11:28.818 --> 11:30.320
No idea.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.561
They must be workin' some angle.

11:32.995 --> 11:35.032
Well, maybe you should come with me.

11:35.076 --> 11:37.231
Protect me. Just in case.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.693
Well, you have to go
to the sit-down, Kit. For sure.

11:43.497 --> 11:45.161
You know, hear what they have to say.

11:45.196 --> 11:47.583
You know, negociation works sometimes, Kit.

11:49.048 --> 11:54.462
Okay, alright. But
at the first sign of bullshit, I walk.

11:57.137 --> 11:58.852
Listen to me, okay?

11:58.887 --> 12:01.840
Stop! Stop! Alright!
You can't fire Greg.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.301
You can't fire him!
Are you listenning to me?!

12:04.347 --> 12:06.361
Do you know what the fuck you're doing?!

12:06.398 --> 12:08.101
It's William on the phone for you.

12:08.757 --> 12:12.072
Jenny, you have to take this.
He's calling from Dubai.

12:14.218 --> 12:15.781
Monsieur,

12:15.815 --> 12:18.702
- you ???. It's nothing.
- Give me a break.

12:19.498 --> 12:21.083
Don't worry about it.

12:21.817 --> 12:23.312
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:23.796 --> 12:25.050
Fine?

12:25.085 --> 12:28.123
She just fired the only male
lead actor

12:28.226 --> 12:30.421
in our fucking movie.
It's not fine, Adele.

12:30.455 --> 12:31.601
I know.

12:31.635 --> 12:33.961
Right now, he's telling her
to march right back in,

12:34.007 --> 12:35.952
apologize to Greg and rehire him.

12:37.328 --> 12:40.000
William? And she'll listen to him?

12:40.778 --> 12:41.793
Yeah.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.353
I think Jenny will listen to him.

12:45.448 --> 12:46.603
Fuck.

12:47.088 --> 12:49.493
- Oh, my God...
- Excuse me.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.831
I'm wandering if any of you

12:51.866 --> 12:53.340
have seen

12:53.378 --> 12:55.830
dumbshit actor boy around?

12:55.867 --> 12:58.723
- No? No one's seen him? Adele?
- Yeah?

13:00.065 --> 13:03.621
Could you, uh, find Mr. Fallon for me?

13:03.665 --> 13:05.002
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

13:08.015 --> 13:10.002
I can see

13:10.046 --> 13:12.723
that you're talking about me.

13:12.765 --> 13:16.273
I can also see that you're talking
about me. So I just wanna

13:16.318 --> 13:17.783
say: "Yes, it's true!"

13:19.038 --> 13:21.421
I did loose my temper

13:21.466 --> 13:25.131
and now I'm on my way to apologize to

13:25.175 --> 13:28.501
Mr. Fallon and I have

13:28.538 --> 13:30.711
made a mistake and

13:30.757 --> 13:34.421
the dumbshit actor boy
is no longer fired. Okay?

13:36.546 --> 13:38.362
Everybody, go back to work.

13:38.396 --> 13:39.761
Now. Go!

13:40.518 --> 13:44.260
Jesus! I can't wait
to get these fucking clothes off.

14:05.847 --> 14:08.050
You have to do it. It's so hot.

14:08.096 --> 14:09.252
Hello?

14:09.296 --> 14:10.252
Hey.

14:10.786 --> 14:12.623
Do you have power at CU?

14:12.667 --> 14:14.703
I'm at home, actually.

14:14.736 --> 14:16.813
It was just, it was unbearably hot
at school.

14:16.907 --> 14:19.193
I mean, it's ten degrees hotter downtown.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.911
I think we have to shot down production.

14:20.948 --> 14:23.441
These rolling blackouts
are costing us a fortune.

14:23.505 --> 14:25.272
<i>??? tens of classes.</i>

14:26.065 --> 14:28.543
Are you gonna go to this,

14:28.575 --> 14:31.020
this SheBar gathering thing?

14:32.597 --> 14:35.473
I think I have to go.
Kit really wants me to be there.

14:35.998 --> 14:37.803
<i>Oh. Well, maybe I won't go, then.</i>

14:40.036 --> 14:42.541
What, you think we can't be
in the same room together?

14:42.546 --> 14:44.240
I think it would be hard.

14:44.285 --> 14:46.900
Yeah, I know. It's hard for me too.

14:48.557 --> 14:50.470
Can you hold on a second? I'm just
gonna pull you on speaker.

14:50.558 --> 14:51.302
<i>Sure.</i>

14:53.797 --> 14:55.802
So, are we, are we still on

14:55.847 --> 14:58.300
<i>- for Dan tonight?
- Yes, six o'clock.</i>

14:58.345 --> 15:00.371
Hopefully it'll be a lot cooler by then.

15:00.405 --> 15:03.143
Although it wasn't last night.

15:03.188 --> 15:04.750
How's Angelina?

15:04.795 --> 15:06.143
<i>Oh my God!</i>

15:06.188 --> 15:08.042
<i>They need you on set two.</i>

15:08.077 --> 15:10.300
Okay. I know that already.
Thanks.

15:10.335 --> 15:11.471
I'll be there.

15:13.017 --> 15:15.871
She was so cute, Bette.

15:15.907 --> 15:17.710
<i>I had to explain to her why</i>

15:17.716 --> 15:20.651
<i>we couldn't turn on the air conditionner
during theses rolling blackouts.</i>

15:20.698 --> 15:21.962
<i>So she went to play group,</i>

15:22.018 --> 15:24.030
and she made this little fan
that she brought at home

15:24.067 --> 15:26.410
and then we took turns
fanning ourselves.

15:27.035 --> 15:29.741
You know, you guys could
come down here and use the pool.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.920
Beside, I've gotta get off.

15:40.955 --> 15:42.641
Okay. I see you tonight.

15:52.628 --> 15:54.070
Who was it?

15:54.107 --> 15:55.793
It was Tina.

15:56.517 --> 16:00.382
We're having
some parenting disagreements. So,

16:00.736 --> 16:04.551
we're gonna go see
the therapist together tonight.

16:04.586 --> 16:05.882
Good for you.

16:15.615 --> 16:16.852
I just, uh,

16:16.888 --> 16:19.563
I wanted to come tell you
that we're gonna shot down for the day.

16:19.608 --> 16:21.771
That's costing us way too much money.

16:21.836 --> 16:23.400
Yeah, I figured.

16:23.405 --> 16:26.192
Do you wanna maybe go out to dinner
one night this week?

16:26.227 --> 16:28.070
You know, I don't think so.

16:29.387 --> 16:31.402
- Okay.
- Tina, I think you're great.

16:31.438 --> 16:32.712
You know that.

16:33.388 --> 16:35.041
I think you're great too, Sam.

16:35.126 --> 16:38.161
But that dinner party was
awkward and uncomfortable and...

16:38.207 --> 16:41.221
I just think I'm gonna take a step back

16:41.256 --> 16:43.202
until you and Bette resolve your stuff.

16:44.708 --> 16:46.982
- Is it that obvious?
- Yeah.

16:46.988 --> 16:48.372
Shit.

16:48.405 --> 16:50.851
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't think anybody else noticed.

16:52.966 --> 16:54.672
I'm sorry, Sam.

16:54.707 --> 16:56.001
It's cool.

16:56.046 --> 16:58.561
We're trying to resolve it.
We're actually,

16:58.587 --> 17:00.582
we're seeing a therapist together,

17:00.586 --> 17:01.901
to

17:01.947 --> 17:03.711
try to understand, you know.

17:06.028 --> 17:08.613
- I hope it'll help.
- It's crazy!

17:08.656 --> 17:11.090
Neither one of us ever thought that

17:12.058 --> 17:15.070
anything like this would ever,
you know, it's...

17:16.175 --> 17:17.942
I mean, it's really over.

17:17.987 --> 17:20.412
- So over.
- Apparently not.

17:22.046 --> 17:25.461
I do feel for Jodi, though.
She is a terrific girl.

17:27.318 --> 17:28.432
Yeah.

17:28.978 --> 17:31.090
She's, she's nice.

17:47.406 --> 17:50.520
- Niki, come on!
- She left as soon as we called her out.

17:50.558 --> 17:51.593
What?

17:51.636 --> 17:52.600
She's gone.

18:09.638 --> 18:10.833
What?

18:10.927 --> 18:13.291
It just feels good.

18:13.335 --> 18:15.372
I'm almost dry.

18:18.315 --> 18:20.082
I'll make you wet again.

18:29.037 --> 18:30.811
Don't. Please.

18:30.855 --> 18:32.742
It's really too fucking hot.

18:33.577 --> 18:35.362
No, that's not it.

18:36.107 --> 18:39.783
Really. It's just so hot.
Please.

18:42.536 --> 18:43.800
Bullshit.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.612
What's going on?

19:03.396 --> 19:05.061
I'm in love with Tina.

19:06.457 --> 19:08.661
What? Did you say something?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.792
I'm unhappy.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.411
Unhappy how?

19:24.485 --> 19:25.952
I'm unhappy...

19:26.515 --> 19:27.832
with...

19:29.637 --> 19:31.773
I'm unhappy with work

19:31.805 --> 19:34.480
and I just don't want to burden you with it.

19:52.476 --> 19:54.420
I want you back.

19:57.518 --> 19:59.502
Your mind,

20:00.296 --> 20:01.972
and your heart,

20:04.248 --> 20:05.611
and your body.

20:07.847 --> 20:09.293
I miss you.

20:28.087 --> 20:30.701
You know, Jenny,
you can go home and get some rest.

20:37.316 --> 20:40.323
Will you please
put this in an envelope?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.292
- Yeah.
- And give it to Niki?

20:42.406 --> 20:43.910
Of course.

20:44.495 --> 20:46.273
It's a love letter.

20:47.506 --> 20:50.050
Will you read it and tell me
if it sucks?

20:56.577 --> 20:58.281
Come here!

20:59.556 --> 21:02.160
Can you tell her to meet me here tonight?

21:02.195 --> 21:03.573
I'll tell her.

21:04.856 --> 21:06.281
Thanks.

21:20.808 --> 21:22.181
How are you?

21:25.765 --> 21:27.800
Wipe those tears.

21:27.848 --> 21:29.432
Are you okay?

21:32.065 --> 21:35.533
Well, are you gonna come with me to that
big, dumb mafia sit-down at SheBar?

21:35.587 --> 21:37.003
- No.
- Why not?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.750
I'm gonna sit right there

21:38.788 --> 21:40.502
and I'm gonna wait for Niki.

21:41.516 --> 21:42.923
No, you're not.

21:42.967 --> 21:46.633
- Why?
- 'Cause that's weak.

21:47.526 --> 21:49.993
- But I am weak.
- No, you're not! You're not weak.

21:50.028 --> 21:51.712
You're the boss of this place.
You could fire

21:51.766 --> 21:53.812
everybody here if you wanted to.

21:53.858 --> 21:55.572
That's not true.

21:58.057 --> 21:59.742
What would you do?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.830
Would you go out and fuck someone?

22:01.866 --> 22:03.201
Probably.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.752
I'd go out and have meaningless sex
with somebody I didn't care about.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.942
Come on, come with me to SheBar.

22:13.945 --> 22:16.880
No. I don't want to have sex
with anybody but Niki.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.341
Well, look,
I have a straight-girl crush that,

22:21.646 --> 22:23.752
that will not go away, so...

22:26.588 --> 22:29.742
Pull them right there.
I need to see your invitations.

22:36.037 --> 22:38.282
Are you fucking serious?
Get off of me!

22:38.327 --> 22:40.320
Spread them, sweetheart.

22:41.267 --> 22:43.662
You could have
at least asked me out to dinner.

22:44.595 --> 22:46.983
- Ah, stop!
- ???

22:47.025 --> 22:48.972
Right this way.

22:49.018 --> 22:51.191
God! This is fucking crazy.

22:51.257 --> 22:53.242
I know, it's total "four families",
isn't it?

22:53.245 --> 22:54.760
It's Cuban!

22:54.808 --> 22:56.093
Hello, ladies.

22:56.178 --> 22:59.130
- So glad you all could make it.
- So, double D, what's the...

22:59.176 --> 23:01.072
Is this... is this her?

23:01.117 --> 23:02.621
What's the deal with this to-do, huh?

23:02.676 --> 23:04.381
Well, I thought we should all
get together,

23:04.447 --> 23:07.333
clear the air,
I mean, of the recent hostilities.

23:07.838 --> 23:11.232
It really pains to see
what could have been a bountiful friendship

23:11.268 --> 23:14.030
reduced to bad feelings and acrimony.

23:14.047 --> 23:16.161
Bountiful friendship? You came into town

23:16.206 --> 23:18.682
- and you pissed all over every one of us!
- No, on the contrary,

23:18.717 --> 23:20.540
- it was you who abused us.
- What?!

23:20.628 --> 23:23.230
Yeah. Cindi and I came to your fair city,

23:23.278 --> 23:24.762
wanting to settle down,

23:24.807 --> 23:27.533
and open up a nice little lesbian hangout.

23:27.577 --> 23:29.710
And then we cordially invite Shane here

23:29.785 --> 23:32.103
to share a little sex amongst friends.

23:32.136 --> 23:33.563
And then what does she do?

23:33.597 --> 23:35.191
She breaks that trust

23:35.248 --> 23:37.060
by seducing my girlfriend.

23:37.106 --> 23:40.363
Denbo, you need to start
singing a new song, 'cause, firstable,

23:40.377 --> 23:43.083
I did not seduce her. And secondly,
you told me it was okay.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.350
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, yeah. She did.

23:46.655 --> 23:48.141
Shut it.

23:48.185 --> 23:51.820
You know, I got an idea. What if
you kept your mouth shut for two seconds

23:51.867 --> 23:54.952
- and you actually let your girlfriend talk?
- Because she's got nothing to say.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.820
- Go fuck yourself.
- See, I thought that was somethin'.

23:57.867 --> 24:01.091
As I was saying,
I understandably reacted,

24:01.126 --> 24:03.333
because in Miami, that shit doesn't fly.

24:03.378 --> 24:06.353
And then insults were traded,
and one of you,

24:06.396 --> 24:10.081
I'm not mentionning any names,
called the police on our establishment.

24:10.128 --> 24:12.793
You infested The Planet with rats.

24:12.816 --> 24:15.641
Just because you have a health problem
with your establishment

24:15.656 --> 24:18.663
does not give you the right to trying
close someone else's business down.

24:18.937 --> 24:21.822
You actually tried to shut down my film.

24:21.896 --> 24:24.312
You did not have permits
for that neighbourhood.

24:24.346 --> 24:27.410
- You are bothering my friends with children.
- This is bullshit, Kit.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.562
Why're you even talking to these jokers?

24:29.597 --> 24:32.013
I'm sorry. I don't think I know you.

24:32.055 --> 24:36.053
- Tasha.
- It's actually Captain Tasha Williams.

24:36.087 --> 24:40.702
And she's here to kick some ass
and take names if necessary.

24:40.735 --> 24:42.542
That is so awesome.

24:42.576 --> 24:45.120
- Really, Cindi?
- What?

24:45.167 --> 24:47.900
- What?! It's impressive.
- You know, Tasha's got a point here.

24:47.938 --> 24:50.443
I really shouldn't sit here and listen
to all this bullshit.

24:50.478 --> 24:54.560
- I should just kick your motherfuckin' ass.
- Oh, be careful what you're saying next, Miss Porter.

24:54.598 --> 24:57.680
I'm trying to be civil here
in the interest of both our businesses.

24:57.717 --> 24:59.830
But if you want this to escalade,
we can do that too.

24:59.917 --> 25:01.973
- Oh, what you think you've been doing?
- Alright. Come on, come on.

25:02.008 --> 25:05.033
- It's supposed to be a peace summit.
- You're never gonna get a peace summit

25:05.078 --> 25:08.311
because you can never believe a single thing
that comes out of this asshole's mouth.

25:08.316 --> 25:10.342
- What did you just fucking...?
- Thank you, thank you.

25:10.386 --> 25:12.161
Enough!

25:22.726 --> 25:24.513
What do you want, Denbo?

25:25.515 --> 25:27.491
What do I want, what do I want...

25:27.948 --> 25:29.593
- Turf.
- Turf.

25:29.626 --> 25:31.530
And divide up the town.

25:31.566 --> 25:33.193
You can have

25:33.227 --> 25:35.953
wednesdays and saturdays,
and we'll take fridays and sundays.

25:36.047 --> 25:37.702
Kit wants mondays too.

25:37.735 --> 25:40.110
Kit wants mondays, Kit wants mondays...

25:40.155 --> 25:42.563
Fine. But we get superbowl weekend.

25:42.645 --> 25:44.273
- Fine.
- Hey!

25:44.316 --> 25:46.971
- No poatching customers.
- It goes both ways.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.961
Now, the question of restitution.

25:50.057 --> 25:52.682
- A restitution?! You...
- A restitution...

25:52.685 --> 25:54.362
For emotional hardship.

25:55.255 --> 25:57.351
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

25:57.395 --> 26:00.041
My honor was maligned,
and that of my lover Cindi's.

26:02.308 --> 26:05.413
And how do you propose
that we restore this lost honor?

26:07.058 --> 26:09.552
We want parts in your movie.

26:09.588 --> 26:11.151
My mov...

26:11.186 --> 26:13.511
- No way.
- I don't want a fucking part in your movie.

26:13.557 --> 26:15.870
- Just Cindi.
- Why would I give

26:15.917 --> 26:19.243
- your lover Cindi a part in my film?
- Because she's goddamn gorgeous.

26:19.288 --> 26:21.462
Look at her. Why wouldn't you give her
a part in your movie?

26:21.478 --> 26:24.331
Well, I think she has a face like an extra.

26:26.796 --> 26:29.503
So you can be an extra on my movie.

26:29.545 --> 26:30.633
No, no, no, no.

26:30.708 --> 26:33.040
She has to have a line.
Something plugging SheBar.

26:33.088 --> 26:35.660
Absolutely not. No fucking way.

26:35.665 --> 26:37.461
That's really too bad.

26:37.498 --> 26:39.553
I wouldn't want another production mishap

26:39.596 --> 26:41.540
to befall your little shoot.
You know,

26:41.585 --> 26:43.771
I have a brother Jo,
he's near engineer in the Team...

26:43.816 --> 26:45.231
Go fuck yourself.

26:46.585 --> 26:49.063
Now, why would I do that
when I can fuck you.

26:50.518 --> 26:53.092
You are so tacky.

26:53.545 --> 26:57.032
I think she's psychotic. What do I do?

26:57.075 --> 26:58.573
Give her a small part.

27:03.537 --> 27:05.470
I thought about it

27:05.508 --> 27:07.550
and you,

27:07.587 --> 27:11.812
Cindi, can play the role of

27:12.878 --> 27:15.483
- party girl number 4.
- Thank you.

27:15.518 --> 27:17.440
Well, I think our business is done here.

27:17.477 --> 27:18.740
We're not finished.

27:18.776 --> 27:20.130
You'd better be soon.

27:20.137 --> 27:22.913
We want a shot out to the SheBar
on "The Look".

27:22.955 --> 27:25.142
Fuck no, Denbo!

27:25.188 --> 27:27.823
A mention on "The Look"
is worth millions in advertising.

27:27.825 --> 27:29.813
Millions, millions... that's about right.
Yeah.

27:29.857 --> 27:33.472
There is no way I'm promoting SheBar
and I'm not promoting The Planet.

27:33.506 --> 27:34.552
You're not?

27:35.018 --> 27:36.803
Well, I think we're done here.

27:36.835 --> 27:37.953
Cindi.

27:39.907 --> 27:42.363
Bette! Podcast.

27:46.718 --> 27:50.370
Alice will give a mention to SheBar
and The Planet, but not on "The Look".

27:50.416 --> 27:52.073
She'll mention both of them

27:52.117 --> 27:53.852
on a podcast.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.901
Okay. Podcast it is.

27:57.948 --> 27:59.701
What do you say, Kit?

28:01.006 --> 28:02.120
Deal?

28:06.545 --> 28:08.422
What do we know
that you'll keep your word?

28:08.425 --> 28:09.931
My word's all I've got.

28:09.968 --> 28:11.943
You're just gonna have to trust me.

28:11.987 --> 28:13.740
Did you decorate this in the 80's?

28:13.778 --> 28:15.401
Come on you guys.

28:15.448 --> 28:18.221
- Thanks. I'll see you sometime.
- Bye, Shane.

28:18.255 --> 28:21.270
You should be waiting for
our call time.

28:21.856 --> 28:24.111
Are you sure
you still wanna do this, Alice? 'Cause

28:24.115 --> 28:26.843
it's so hot in here.
I thought they had air-conditionning.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.042
Yeah, I'm right. I mean,
if you are, I'm ready.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.480
- "Love For Life" by Standfast -

28:30.517 --> 28:32.670
I'm so happy to be out of there.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.233
I didn't think we were gonna
get outta here alive, did you?

28:34.277 --> 28:36.870
No, I didn't. I didn't even wanna go
in the first place.

28:36.915 --> 28:38.272
So, is that thing ready for me?

28:39.056 --> 28:41.330
Yeah. You just have to press
the red button.

28:41.626 --> 28:44.301
- Red button.
- Yeah, the little red button.

28:49.126 --> 28:51.431
- Okay.
- Give me a signal. A signal.

28:51.466 --> 28:54.023
A signal?
How's that for signal?

28:54.535 --> 28:56.383
Good? So...

28:57.057 --> 29:00.041
Hi there. I'm Alice Pieszecki
and this is "Alice in Lesboland"

29:00.116 --> 29:02.823
and today I have my collegue Max Sweeney
with me.

29:03.335 --> 29:04.643
Hi, everybody.

29:04.675 --> 29:06.473
As some of you may know,
Max is sort of

29:06.518 --> 29:09.733
our behind the scenes techy guy
on OurChart, and, uh,

29:09.768 --> 29:11.692
he recently, uh,

29:11.726 --> 29:16.012
did a blog about being a trans-guy
and it kinda pissed some of you off and

29:16.058 --> 29:18.932
I said some things
that weren't so cool,

29:18.947 --> 29:22.701
apparently, and I just wanted
to apologize publically to Max.

29:22.737 --> 29:24.712
So, I'm sorry, Max.

29:24.758 --> 29:27.720
Actually, um, you said
that I wasn't part of your community.

29:27.756 --> 29:30.811
Which is... it's more than just
kind of uncool.

29:30.848 --> 29:33.620
- Wouldn't you say?
- Yeah, I would, yes.

29:33.665 --> 29:35.893
And I'm very sorry.

29:35.937 --> 29:39.393
After I said that, I heard from
one of our guestbian blogger,

29:39.438 --> 29:40.980
Kate Kendell, who's also the director of

29:41.005 --> 29:44.632
the National Center for Lesbian Rights,
and she told me that

29:44.677 --> 29:49.300
I sucked and was full of shit
for the same reasons. So,

29:49.348 --> 29:51.941
- I am sorry.
- Thanks, Kate.

29:51.986 --> 29:54.120
Well, I guess I just kinda figured that

29:54.128 --> 29:56.110
you'd understand
the importance of inclusion.

29:56.188 --> 29:58.650
Of course I do. I just think
they're really different.

29:58.695 --> 30:01.900
I think being bisexual is just more natural

30:01.938 --> 30:04.133
and I think that trans, sort of,

30:04.156 --> 30:06.390
it's a little hard for people to swallow it.
I think they're very different.

30:06.398 --> 30:09.992
Well, the main argument
against homosexuality is it's not natural.

30:10.038 --> 30:12.952
And that it's not what
real men and women do. Right?

30:12.988 --> 30:16.691
And I mean, if you're gonna
talk about sexism and

30:16.736 --> 30:19.910
homophobia and reproductive rights,

30:19.955 --> 30:22.901
and all the other stuff I heard you
talking about last week on "The Look",

30:22.926 --> 30:25.282
then, I mean, you've gotta accept this,
you've gotta

30:25.326 --> 30:28.462
stop marginalizing the transgendre,
sisters and brothers.

30:28.507 --> 30:29.941
I hear you.

30:30.525 --> 30:32.653
So, again, I am sorry.

30:34.948 --> 30:36.791
Here you go.

30:39.015 --> 30:41.821
Wait. I thought Jodi liked chalatte.

30:41.857 --> 30:43.251
Oh, it's for Tina.

30:43.288 --> 30:45.543
We're going
to a therapy session together.

30:49.455 --> 30:51.192
Just to talk about Angie.

30:51.928 --> 30:56.061
Now I know you're bullshit me, because
ain't nothing wrong with baby girl.

30:57.835 --> 30:59.911
We're gonna talk about parenting.

31:01.956 --> 31:03.340
What's going on?

31:04.217 --> 31:05.621
Nothing.

31:08.088 --> 31:09.450
Bette...

31:11.735 --> 31:13.203
Fuck!

31:13.245 --> 31:14.981
Come back here.

31:18.035 --> 31:20.653
- Don't you dare.
- Don't I dare do what?

31:20.697 --> 31:22.922
Don't you dare do that to Jodi!

31:22.957 --> 31:25.523
I'm not trying to do anything to anyone.

31:27.238 --> 31:29.493
Well, you just better be careful.

31:30.577 --> 31:32.740
That's why were going to see a therapist.

31:34.386 --> 31:37.160
- Please don't say anything.
- To who?

31:37.205 --> 31:38.872
I dunno.

31:44.545 --> 31:47.710
Working on OurChart's been
totally awesome, actually.

31:47.718 --> 31:49.783
- You're way a better boss than the last one.
- Oh, good.

31:49.827 --> 31:52.473
You have been kind a trans
for the ??? or whatever.

31:52.506 --> 31:53.910
Yeah. You know.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.622
- Thanks.
- I mean,

31:55.666 --> 31:58.130
he tried to set me up with his daughter,
right,

31:58.165 --> 31:59.213
and

31:59.255 --> 32:01.271
I'm not outta work, so they don't know

32:01.305 --> 32:03.152
that I'm not a vile guy.

32:04.608 --> 32:05.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:05.815 --> 32:07.512
This is Richard, Shane.

32:07.546 --> 32:10.042
- Richard, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

32:10.085 --> 32:11.580
- Good stuff.
- Yeah,

32:11.648 --> 32:13.811
you pro the big oil business,
aren't you?

32:13.855 --> 32:16.053
I told her about your internship
with ??? Peterson,

32:16.126 --> 32:18.402
which he quit, because he decided
it was immoral

32:18.436 --> 32:20.172
and after I told him,
we're breaking up

32:20.215 --> 32:21.901
because he was an environmental criminal.

32:21.947 --> 32:23.393
- Hi.
- Hi! I'm sorry.

32:23.476 --> 32:25.330
- Podcast, yeah.
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.

32:27.735 --> 32:30.551
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Molly.
This is Phyllis' daughter.

32:32.487 --> 32:34.580
I'm familiar with Phyllis.

32:34.626 --> 32:36.543
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm Max.

32:38.037 --> 32:40.400
- How is it going?
- Good.

32:40.445 --> 32:42.053
Listen, Richard, welcome to ???

32:42.085 --> 32:43.710
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

32:46.536 --> 32:48.850
You know that Jenny gave away a part
in your movie, by the way.

32:48.886 --> 32:50.580
To that girl,

32:50.616 --> 32:52.832
- Cindi. Cindi, the lover Cindi.
- I can't believe

32:52.865 --> 32:55.000
- Jenny gave a part in the movie to Cindi.
- Yeah.

32:55.046 --> 32:57.240
Crazy week. Can you hold on one second?

32:57.287 --> 32:59.433
Yeah, that's all your production needs.

32:59.466 --> 33:02.100
So, how much money you're tend to lose

33:02.138 --> 33:04.023
when you have to shut down
production for the day?

33:04.068 --> 33:08.070
Well, it depends if the crew is already on,
you know, that can suck,

33:08.117 --> 33:11.120
and then if the crew's not on
then it depends on how many locations

33:11.168 --> 33:12.913
we have secured and...

33:14.315 --> 33:16.910
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

33:18.016 --> 33:20.511
Jesus. What were we thinking?!
God damn!

33:20.556 --> 33:22.903
They said the rolling blackouts were over.

33:24.487 --> 33:26.231
- Oh shit.
- What the fuck is that?!

33:26.275 --> 33:29.130
- Fuck! I can't get a signal.
- Oh god!

33:31.098 --> 33:33.270
Shit! I don't like this.

33:33.306 --> 33:35.603
I don't like it. It's gonna get really
fucking hot here in about two seconds.

33:35.635 --> 33:37.150
I cannot take the heat.

33:37.186 --> 33:39.252
I'm gonna have a panic attack.
I know I am.

33:39.296 --> 33:40.540
Breathe.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.482
Breathe. Deep breath.

33:42.507 --> 33:44.652
I don't wanna breathe too deep.
I'll take up all the oxygen.

33:44.695 --> 33:46.520
It's gonna be fine.

33:46.556 --> 33:49.500
Jesus, it is fucking hot
in this city of yours.

33:50.045 --> 33:51.360
Hey!

33:51.898 --> 33:53.583
Where have you been?

33:53.628 --> 33:55.953
I got a show.
I've been painting like a maniac.

33:55.995 --> 33:57.993
Really? I didn't even know
you were an artist.

33:58.035 --> 33:59.071
Yeah.

33:59.107 --> 34:01.220
Not a big rich artist like Jodi,

34:01.305 --> 34:04.550
- which is why I interprete for her.
- To pay the bills, right.

34:04.597 --> 34:05.893
Exactly.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.690
- So where's your girlfriend?
- If you mean Grace,

34:17.735 --> 34:19.362
she's in San Fransisco.

34:21.036 --> 34:22.920
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.440
It's really nice to see you.

34:28.516 --> 34:30.063
Good, because

34:30.108 --> 34:33.161
I've actually been thinking about you.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.301
Yeah?

34:35.045 --> 34:36.179
Which

34:37.005 --> 34:39.840
is why I haven't come around
because it's kinda freaking me out.

34:43.485 --> 34:44.493
Yeah.

34:44.536 --> 34:45.940
Yeah, I get it.

34:45.985 --> 34:47.331
It's cool.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.773
Would you sit with me for a minute?

35:02.086 --> 35:04.363
I was actually thinking

35:04.406 --> 35:06.912
maybe you'd like to go out sometime.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.832
Well, you mean like on a date?

35:09.876 --> 35:11.711
Yeah, like a date.

35:13.995 --> 35:15.973
Yeah, sure.

35:16.596 --> 35:18.033
Maybe tonight?

35:20.057 --> 35:21.590
Alright.

35:22.316 --> 35:23.772
Yeah.

35:29.077 --> 35:32.741
- "Private Number"
by William Bell (feat. Judy Clay) -

35:45.685 --> 35:47.780
What are you doing?

35:49.366 --> 35:52.210
I'm feeling what 6 P.M. feels like.

36:16.547 --> 36:20.643
I'm never home by 6 P.M.
I'm usually stuck on the ???

36:32.655 --> 36:35.992
I have nothing that I'm supposed
to be doing right now.

37:05.006 --> 37:07.783
Do you think that
Danny might know we're in here?

37:07.826 --> 37:10.682
I'm sure he's doing everything he can.

37:15.488 --> 37:17.742
What do you think he would say
of us right now?

37:17.786 --> 37:20.232
If we were on session with him?

37:27.896 --> 37:30.513
He would probably ask
what each of us wants.

37:30.547 --> 37:33.290
And we would say: "We don't know".

37:35.016 --> 37:36.542
And he would ask:

37:37.275 --> 37:40.570
What are you afraid of, Tina?

37:44.567 --> 37:45.981
Fucking it all up.

37:52.006 --> 37:54.300
What else are you afraid of, Tina?

37:54.335 --> 37:56.111
I'm afraid of, um...

37:57.925 --> 38:01.133
what everyone will think of us,
how they'll judge us,

38:01.175 --> 38:03.043
how hurt Jodi will be.

38:04.545 --> 38:06.793
She already knows
there's something wrong.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.240
- Did you tell her about us?
- God, no.

38:09.285 --> 38:11.312
I've been such a fucking coward.

38:14.007 --> 38:16.433
And, you know, it's not like we really...

38:19.248 --> 38:21.480
I don't know, it was never just...

38:22.698 --> 38:24.500
easy like...

38:24.537 --> 38:26.312
What do you mean "never easy"?

38:26.357 --> 38:29.260
Well, we don't share the same values
Jodi and I.

38:29.297 --> 38:31.471
Do you think we share the same values?

38:31.527 --> 38:33.190
Of course I do!

38:33.238 --> 38:35.340
I mean, I think that's why
we were able to parent together

38:35.387 --> 38:38.331
when things were the most
acrimonous between us.

38:38.376 --> 38:41.910
I mean, it's so fucking rare, Tina.

38:42.025 --> 38:44.560
We both care about the quality of life,

38:44.567 --> 38:47.761
you know, and I like
the choices you make,

38:49.015 --> 38:51.641
and the things
that you surround yourself with.

38:52.996 --> 38:55.201
I mean, this attention to beauty...

38:55.788 --> 38:57.932
I think that's important.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.543
And I'm comfortable with,

39:01.575 --> 39:03.452
you know, the people of your world,
and I think

39:03.487 --> 39:05.790
you're comfortable with the people of mine.

39:12.087 --> 39:14.621
We like the same people.

39:14.657 --> 39:18.042
And we dislike the same people.

39:21.145 --> 39:24.161
We'd both rather stay in on New Year's Eve.

39:28.526 --> 39:30.101
Yes, Dan.

39:31.176 --> 39:33.501
What is it that you're afraid of?

39:35.895 --> 39:37.550
I'm afraid that I'm...

39:38.287 --> 39:40.161
destructive.

39:41.558 --> 39:44.071
That if I have something good,

39:45.536 --> 39:48.253
I feel compelled to destroy it.

39:51.098 --> 39:55.251
Look, I'm not so pure and innocent, okay?
I was awful

39:55.286 --> 39:57.883
when I was with Henry.
I was flailing.

39:59.028 --> 40:00.992
Look how I treated you. I

40:01.027 --> 40:03.633
used Angelica against you. I was

40:03.666 --> 40:05.882
- despicable.
- I love you.

40:12.006 --> 40:13.503
I love you.

40:15.545 --> 40:18.302
I have no doubt about that.

40:20.775 --> 40:23.050
I'm just afraid that...

40:23.096 --> 40:26.052
That everything you're feeling right now
is because...

40:26.096 --> 40:28.053
we're not really together.

40:30.065 --> 40:31.631
It's an affair.

40:34.027 --> 40:36.432
- No.
- But it is.

40:37.667 --> 40:39.623
For me,

40:39.656 --> 40:42.252
when I really search myself,

40:42.287 --> 40:45.211
it doesn't feel like an affair.

40:46.588 --> 40:48.443
For me,

40:53.208 --> 40:55.522
it feels like I'm coming home.

40:59.948 --> 41:01.811
- "Emergency" by The Sweet Inspirations -

41:08.788 --> 41:10.793
Jen, we have to get outta here now.

41:10.827 --> 41:13.321
I don't want to.
I just wanna stick around

41:13.358 --> 41:15.722
- probably a little bit more.
- It's too hot.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.331
It's way too hot.

41:17.378 --> 41:19.231
I know, but I just wanna wait.

41:25.026 --> 41:26.180
Perfect.

41:30.895 --> 41:32.240
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

41:32.278 --> 41:33.621
I'm here in the house all by myself

41:33.727 --> 41:37.462
and the lights keep going on and off
and it's really fucking scary.

41:37.498 --> 41:39.733
<i>Give me a fucking break.
You're not scared.</i>

41:40.285 --> 41:42.001
Shut up. Just come over.

41:42.035 --> 41:43.162
Where's Richard?

41:43.238 --> 41:45.312
<i>I don't know, probably on a plane
back to Ramon.</i>

41:45.376 --> 41:47.113
After his lame ass effort
to get me back,

41:47.145 --> 41:48.911
- I sent him home.
- Oh yeah?

41:48.948 --> 41:50.370
How was that?

41:50.377 --> 41:52.791
<i>He knows I'm a stucker
for a romantic gesture, so he got</i>

41:52.828 --> 41:55.270
a fly away across the country
and then, when he got here,

41:55.308 --> 41:57.890
he was this lock-jawed, tight-assed ever.

41:59.037 --> 42:00.841
<i>Well, the lights went out.</i>

42:00.886 --> 42:02.663
Oh, fucking shit! Again?!

42:02.706 --> 42:04.942
Can you please, please come over?

42:04.975 --> 42:05.983
Please...

42:09.306 --> 42:10.802
Hello?

42:13.068 --> 42:14.232
Come in.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.851
Oh my God!

42:20.527 --> 42:23.272
This is the most beautiful letter

42:23.307 --> 42:25.523
than anyone has ever written to me and

42:25.557 --> 42:29.251
it completely reminded me of why
I want to be in this movie and

42:29.298 --> 42:32.191
how I am so into you
and I just love you so.

42:36.768 --> 42:39.182
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God!

42:39.227 --> 42:41.560
Fuck! I didn't, I didn't...
I don't know what happened. I didn't...

42:42.508 --> 42:44.943
- It's okay.
- You need to go to the production office.

42:45.548 --> 42:47.563
I thought that's where
you were gonna meet her.

42:47.596 --> 42:49.731
She's gonna be so fucking mad.

42:49.746 --> 42:51.511
Look, she doesn't have to know, okay?

42:51.548 --> 42:53.611
- What?
- Yeah, I mean,

42:53.658 --> 42:55.973
I'm not gonna tell her
unless you are.

42:56.017 --> 42:58.412
You look a lot like her in the dark.

42:58.458 --> 43:01.162
And it's weird, because you kind of
even look like her right now.

43:01.207 --> 43:02.853
She really loves you, you know?

43:03.518 --> 43:04.660
I know.

43:04.698 --> 43:06.292
I love her too.

43:08.245 --> 43:10.152
I'll see you later, Adele.

43:20.867 --> 43:22.873
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

43:22.908 --> 43:26.040
- Sorry about earlier. Thanks.
- Sure.

43:26.048 --> 43:28.713
- I was really scared.
- Oh, no. I get it. It

43:29.266 --> 43:31.132
- was crazy driving over here, so...
- No.

43:31.206 --> 43:34.263
Not scared of the dark.
Scared because I wanna fuck you.

43:34.326 --> 43:35.351
Wine?

43:35.395 --> 43:38.150
I've got a red french bourgogne here,
unless you prefer...

43:38.198 --> 43:40.931
- No, no, I like it.
- Okay, good, good, good.

43:40.977 --> 43:42.582
I've never done this before.

43:42.618 --> 43:44.840
I mean, I kissed a girl that one time
in Girl Scouts,

43:44.876 --> 43:46.602
but it was just that one time thing,

43:46.608 --> 43:48.772
and it was "Truth or Dare"
and it never happened again.

43:49.447 --> 43:50.742
Molly, we don't have to do anything,

43:50.776 --> 43:53.120
you know. We can just hang out
in the dark. It's okay.

43:53.218 --> 43:54.823
But I think you're really sexy.

43:59.066 --> 43:59.970
Yeah.

44:01.387 --> 44:02.760
That's good, um...

44:03.505 --> 44:05.082
I think you're,

44:06.006 --> 44:08.990
- I think you are too.
- Richard thinks I'm olddly proportion.

44:10.327 --> 44:11.800
- Richard's a tool.
- I know.

44:11.855 --> 44:15.063
We went to Nantucket last summer, and
I caught him jerking off to internet porn

44:15.108 --> 44:17.533
when I wasn't looking.
How gross is that, right?

44:17.575 --> 44:20.643
Yeah. He says he loves me
but he's totally full of shit. More?

44:20.686 --> 44:24.303
- Why are we ??? Richard still?
- You're right. Fuck Richard.

44:25.238 --> 44:27.380
Let's go upstairs.
Can you grab the candle?

44:28.625 --> 44:30.062
Yeah.

44:30.098 --> 44:31.692
Fuck that guy.

44:31.777 --> 44:33.553
I'm not gonna marry Richard.
I told him that today.

44:33.596 --> 44:34.841
'Cause what's marriage anyway?

44:34.935 --> 44:36.853
It's an ill-conceived antiquated institution

44:36.895 --> 44:39.271
created by people who did not expect
to live past 30.

44:39.278 --> 44:40.773
- Did you know that?
- No.

44:40.816 --> 44:42.243
I took a gender study class
and did you know that

44:42.285 --> 44:43.633
in medieval Europe,

44:43.678 --> 44:45.903
the wedding ring
was the symbol of ownership?

44:45.935 --> 44:49.181
Seriously. It was a down paiment
on the bride sale.

44:49.218 --> 44:50.480
- Can you believe that shit?
- Wow! No.

44:50.517 --> 44:53.080
I know, right? It's fucked up.
I'm sorry. I'm talking too much.

44:53.118 --> 44:55.340
I'll stop talking.
I tend to do that when I'm nervous.

44:55.898 --> 44:57.321
- "Let Da Music" by Quiero Club -

44:58.735 --> 44:59.982
Thanks for diner.

45:00.028 --> 45:00.911
Sure.

45:09.668 --> 45:11.083
Can I kiss you?

45:12.038 --> 45:13.071
Yeah.

45:38.097 --> 45:40.022
Most improves.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.162
Gotta start somewhere.

45:45.797 --> 45:47.213
Nice room.

46:40.978 --> 46:42.771
We don't have to do this, you know.

46:45.018 --> 46:47.821
- We don't have to.
- I know,

46:47.858 --> 46:49.553
we don't have to.

47:04.608 --> 47:05.961
Weird.

47:05.978 --> 47:07.362
- What? What?
- Boobs.

47:08.097 --> 47:09.660
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:09.706 --> 47:11.101
I'm an idiot.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.071
- Jenny...
- Hi.

47:22.107 --> 47:24.301
- Oh my God!
- You came!

47:26.545 --> 47:30.932
That was the most amazing letter
that anyone has ever written to me.

47:30.965 --> 47:33.880
And it made me realize
why I wanted to do this film.

47:40.288 --> 47:42.300
What? What?

47:42.336 --> 47:45.831
- Jenny, I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

47:45.878 --> 47:48.592
- I'm so sorry.
- And I'm so sorry.

47:51.345 --> 47:53.321
I love you, I love you!

47:53.955 --> 47:55.683
- "Swimming Pool" by Freezepop -

48:02.847 --> 48:06.290
- What?
- You really are like a guy. A really

48:06.335 --> 48:08.150
sexy guy.

48:10.098 --> 48:11.803
Except you are softer.

48:17.726 --> 48:19.480
- Guess what?
- What?

48:20.798 --> 48:22.401
I'm not a guy.

48:22.988 --> 48:24.573
Surprise!

48:42.728 --> 48:43.760
You're wet.

48:45.225 --> 48:46.901
What did you expect?

48:46.947 --> 48:48.903
I don't know. Not that.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.472
I don't know if you're ready for this.

49:01.368 --> 49:02.620
I'm ready for this.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.693
Am I doing right?

49:20.576 --> 49:22.172
Yeah.

49:22.176 --> 49:24.223
Yeah.

49:24.268 --> 49:25.771
You're doing perfect.

49:35.505 --> 49:37.352
- What's that look?
- What?

49:37.395 --> 49:39.540
What are you doing?

49:40.037 --> 49:41.640
What are you talking about?

49:42.755 --> 49:44.380
I'm not doing anything.

49:44.416 --> 49:46.362
Really...

49:46.408 --> 49:48.432
It's hot in here, isn't it?

49:49.897 --> 49:51.920
It's getting hotter.

49:54.885 --> 49:57.362
Well, that maybe can cool you off.

49:57.405 --> 49:58.751
Yeah!

50:32.417 --> 50:33.620
Let's take this off.

50:47.528 --> 50:49.240
It feels good.

53:17.558 --> 53:19.681
How are you gonna fuck me?

54:20.305 --> 54:22.801
That was amazing! Of course
it was amazing 'cause

54:22.847 --> 54:24.653
you're a girl and you

54:25.725 --> 54:27.420
know how to do that.

54:37.398 --> 54:39.200
What are you doing?

54:46.576 --> 54:48.862
I don't really think
I'm ready for this yet.

54:49.466 --> 54:51.313
I don't think I know how.

54:51.358 --> 54:52.573
I'm sorry.

55:02.388 --> 55:04.502
I will show one more time.

55:21.907 --> 55:23.053
Fuck!

55:35.876 --> 55:37.183
Oh God...

55:37.945 --> 55:40.152
We'll take it slowly.

55:41.898 --> 55:43.213
Well, how are you going to tell her?

55:43.256 --> 55:45.071
Are you gonna tell her it's because of us?

55:45.106 --> 55:46.201
No.

55:46.627 --> 55:47.700
But if it's okay with you,

55:47.707 --> 55:49.690
I don't want to tell her before the ride.

55:49.738 --> 55:51.282
You know, the Pink Ride.

55:55.318 --> 55:56.711
I love you.

55:58.918 --> 56:00.202
I love you too.

56:06.705 --> 56:08.322
- Hi, Dan.
- The poor, poor things.

56:08.366 --> 56:10.370
There's nothing we could do.
Are you okay?

56:10.417 --> 56:12.990
- We're fine.
- Anybody traumatized?

56:13.017 --> 56:15.893
I think we actually
clarified some things for ourselves.

56:15.935 --> 56:18.512
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're not even a lesbian.

56:18.518 --> 56:20.181
Neither were you a year ago.

56:20.228 --> 56:22.600
When I left you this afternoon,
you were with Richard.

56:22.636 --> 56:24.361
- This is beneath you.
- What,

56:24.408 --> 56:26.421
because Shane's never read Proust,
she's beneath me?

56:26.455 --> 56:28.053
She's never even heard of Proust.

56:28.088 --> 56:30.340
Who cares if she's heard of Proust?
I'm so sick of you judging

56:30.378 --> 56:31.903
everyone I know.

56:31.945 --> 56:34.573
So Shane's not gonna win a
MacArthur genius grant anytime soon.

56:34.616 --> 56:36.062
It's really nice for once
to be with someone

56:36.075 --> 56:37.932
who's a little bit uneducated.

56:37.967 --> 56:40.363
- She probably went to community college.
- Who cares

56:40.406 --> 56:44.083
if she went to community college! Who cares
if she even graduated from high school!

56:44.116 --> 56:46.012
I don't like Shane for her political views.

56:46.038 --> 56:47.573
I like Shane because she's easy

56:47.616 --> 56:50.413
and simple. And maybe she's not
the smartest person in the world,

56:50.416 --> 56:52.391
but at least she's not fucking Richard.

56:52.425 --> 56:54.601
See how long this lasts.
