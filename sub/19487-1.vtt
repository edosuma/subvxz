02:09.937 --> 02:13.374
<i>There was nothing
extraordinary about my mum and dad.</i>

02:14.442 --> 02:16.343
<i>Nothing dramatic.</i>

02:18.546 --> 02:20.242
<i>No divorce or anything.</i>

02:22.917 --> 02:27.651
<i>But they were my parents, and I wanted
to remember them by doing a picture book.</i>

02:37.198 --> 02:40.794
<i>It's a bit odd, really,
having a book about my parents</i>

02:40.935 --> 02:45.635
<i>up there in the bestseller list among
all the football heroes and cookbooks.</i>

02:47.475 --> 02:49.876
<i>They'd be proud of that, I suppose.</i>

02:52.080 --> 02:54.549
<i>But probably rather embarrassed, too.</i>

02:56.350 --> 02:59.548
<i>I imagine they would say,
"It wasn't like that."</i>

03:00.888 --> 03:03.221
<i>Or, "How can you talk about that?"</i>

03:06.861 --> 03:08.591
<i>Well, I have…</i>

03:08.696 --> 03:11.097
<i>And this is their story.</i>

03:57.845 --> 03:58.938
Bye, Mum.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.639
Bye, dear.

04:00.748 --> 04:02.512
Ta-ta, Ern, mate.

04:02.650 --> 04:04.448
Ta-ta.

04:06.487 --> 04:08.115
Ta-ta!

04:12.927 --> 04:15.487
Hurry up with that dusting, Ethel.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.122
There's the fire to stoke
and the beds to make.

04:18.266 --> 04:20.258
Yes, madam. I won't be long.

04:40.955 --> 04:44.289
Ethel, aren't you finished yet?

04:44.392 --> 04:46.691
Yes, madam.

04:46.794 --> 04:48.786
Sorry, madam.

05:02.143 --> 05:03.475
Hey-hey.

05:03.578 --> 05:05.274
Ooh…

05:11.953 --> 05:14.718
Ethel… where are you?

05:14.822 --> 05:16.415
Coming, madam.

05:24.098 --> 05:25.566
Oh.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.902
Ethel?

05:34.041 --> 05:35.703
Ethel!

05:36.911 --> 05:38.903
- Ethel!
- Oh.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.022
Yes, yes. I'm coming.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.592
Hello, duck.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.754
Oh. Oh, it's you.

05:55.863 --> 05:57.627
Thought I'd introduce myself.

05:57.765 --> 06:00.735
You've waved that blooming duster
at me enough times.

06:00.835 --> 06:03.566
Well, no, I didn't mean to.
It was just that erm…

06:03.671 --> 06:04.832
Name's Ernest.

06:05.006 --> 06:07.237
Oh. I'm Ethel.

06:07.375 --> 06:11.938
That's a nice name. Well, Ethel,
how about coming to the pictures with me?

06:12.079 --> 06:14.207
Oh… Well, I erm…

06:14.348 --> 06:16.442
They've got lots for me to do.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.883
- What time you knock off?
- I finish about seven.

06:19.053 --> 06:21.887
Perfect. They're showing
Hangman's House at the local.

06:22.056 --> 06:24.184
- You mean, the Coronation?
- Yes.

06:24.292 --> 06:27.091
- Starts at eight. I can meet you there.
- Thank you.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.220
That… That would be very nice.

06:29.363 --> 06:30.558
Grand.

06:30.665 --> 06:32.600
And these… they're for you.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.101
Oh…

06:35.236 --> 06:37.467
They're… lovely.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.233
See you about quarter to, then.

06:39.373 --> 06:41.672
Yes. Yes, I'll be there.

06:45.713 --> 06:47.511
Oh.

06:48.883 --> 06:50.715
Ernest.

06:58.225 --> 07:00.217
- Next.
- Two, please.

07:17.411 --> 07:20.643
- Victor McLaglen.
- Who's he?

07:20.748 --> 07:23.343
- Him up there.
- Oh.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.885
My favourite.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.488
Oh.

07:37.431 --> 07:39.923
Oh, thank you.

07:40.101 --> 07:41.763
Oh!

07:41.902 --> 07:45.339
Oh, Ernest, doesn't it sound wonderful?

07:45.473 --> 07:48.910
Cor blimey, Et, five shillings to get in.

07:49.043 --> 07:51.103
A bit posh, if you ask me.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.913
Tell you what, it's under a shilling
at our church hall next Saturday.

07:57.051 --> 08:00.044
- Are you on?
- Oh, Ernest.

08:10.331 --> 08:12.596
Lovely flowers, darling.

08:12.733 --> 08:15.293
Oh, that's Dad.
He's potty about the garden.

08:15.403 --> 08:18.862
- Did you all grow up here?
- Yes. 11 of us.

08:18.973 --> 08:23.411
Bob, Beaty, Mag, Edie, me, Frank, Flo,
Jessie, George, Joe and Bill.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.536
Cor blimey.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.773
Come and meet Mum and Dad.

08:27.915 --> 08:31.750
Ernest, your tie.
Wanna make a good impression.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.185
Oh, yes, darling.

08:34.321 --> 08:36.483
George was killed in the war.

08:36.590 --> 08:40.755
Bob died as a baby.
And Beaty died at two and a half.

08:42.930 --> 08:44.421
Poor little kiddies.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.193
Mm.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.892
Hello, dear.

08:48.002 --> 08:51.598
Mum, this is Ernest.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.834
Very pleased to meet you er… Mrs Bowyer.

09:05.319 --> 09:07.788
You haven't asked me to your home yet,
dear.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.915
Yeah, well,
it's not as nice as yours, darling.

09:11.025 --> 09:13.722
- What do you mean, not as nice?
- Well…

09:13.828 --> 09:16.957
The scrap iron, rag-and-bone men.

09:17.064 --> 09:19.533
There's fights outside the pubs.
Women, too.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.261
The coppers won't go down there.

09:21.402 --> 09:23.530
Last one that did go, they bashed him up,

09:23.637 --> 09:26.937
then sat on him and blew his whistle
to fetch more coppers.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.976
Oh, Ernest.

09:29.076 --> 09:31.136
It's not your cup of tea, darling.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.250
Am I to understand
that you wish to leave us?

09:43.390 --> 09:45.256
Yes, madam.

09:45.392 --> 09:47.020
To get married?

09:47.161 --> 09:48.459
Yes, madam.

09:48.596 --> 09:51.395
To a man?

09:51.499 --> 09:53.058
Yes, madam.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.294
Well…

09:55.436 --> 09:57.428
I hope you know what you're doing.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.600
Ever so sorry, madam.

10:07.081 --> 10:08.982
Give us your box, darling.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.178
Oh! I don't like leaving them.

10:12.319 --> 10:13.981
They're so helpless.

10:14.088 --> 10:16.922
- They can't do a thing for themselves.
- Hm.

10:17.057 --> 10:18.855
Serve 'em right.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.020
- Bloated plutocrats.
- There's no need to swear, Ernest.

10:22.129 --> 10:23.825
What?

10:25.866 --> 10:28.529
Don't worry about them.
They'll soon get another skivvy.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.195
I was not a skivvy!

10:31.338 --> 10:33.500
I was a lady's maid.

10:33.641 --> 10:37.339
And what's more…
I'm going to be married.

10:37.478 --> 10:39.344
So am I!

10:54.428 --> 10:56.659
Oh, it's lovely.

10:56.764 --> 11:01.930
But £825?
Can we afford that mortgage business?

11:02.069 --> 11:05.130
Yes, easy.
I'll be getting three guineas a week soon.

11:05.272 --> 11:07.036
Besides, we've got 25 years.

11:07.141 --> 11:12.170
19… 55, it'll be ours.

11:13.347 --> 11:15.839
A wrought-iron gate, Your Ladyship.

11:17.251 --> 11:18.776
Silly.

11:18.919 --> 11:23.482
Oh, and look, Ernest. A marble pillar.

11:27.661 --> 11:30.062
Ho-ho! Look at this.

11:30.164 --> 11:31.996
Oh.

11:33.701 --> 11:37.763
Oh, Ernest. There's so much space.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.137
We could get those electric lights put in.

11:41.275 --> 11:45.269
Yeah, nice and modern. Brother Fred's
got a wireless. He can hear Germany.

11:45.412 --> 11:48.143
Whatever would you want
to hear Germany for?

11:50.551 --> 11:51.575
Oh!

11:51.719 --> 11:54.587
A French window.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.081
Oh, Ernest. There's a bathroom!

11:58.192 --> 12:00.184
Blimey. A lav, too.

12:00.327 --> 12:02.421
Yeah, come along, Ernest.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.495
Hm.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.228
Hah!

12:08.402 --> 12:10.234
Enormous bedroom.

12:10.404 --> 12:12.032
Four windows in one room.

12:12.172 --> 12:15.540
Well, it'll cost a fortune for curtains.

12:15.643 --> 12:18.169
Bit different to home, eh, darling?

12:18.312 --> 12:20.144
Lots of rooms for two people.

12:20.247 --> 12:23.411
Perhaps there'll be more than two one day.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.422
What? Lodgers you mean?

12:28.555 --> 12:30.319
No.

12:32.059 --> 12:34.995
This could be our baby's room.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.030
Nice and warm over the kitchen.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.960
Must get rid of this old range.

12:40.067 --> 12:43.162
Cor, and this boiler.

More than down home.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.349
Oh, I've always wanted
my own bit of garden.

12:57.484 --> 12:59.851
Good little shed for my bike and workshop.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.785
Yeah, mind you keep it tidy.

13:01.889 --> 13:05.951
Don't you start bossing me about

13:06.060 --> 13:09.189
Oh, Ernest, I can't believe it.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.060
We'll have a kitchen and a scullery.

13:11.198 --> 13:14.168
- A sitting room and a dining room.
- A garden and a shed.

13:14.268 --> 13:16.362

13:16.503 --> 13:19.905

13:28.382 --> 13:31.875
That's it, lovely. That's it, Mrs Briggs,
lovely. Very nice. Now, hold there.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.784
Hold it there. Big smiles.

13:34.888 --> 13:38.689
- We'll have one more of those.
- Ern, let's see a kiss for the bride.

13:38.826 --> 13:40.818
Go on, Ern.

We'll need some cases
under the bed for our clothes.

14:08.322 --> 14:13.260
- A wardrobe, Ernest.
- Oh. Oh, yes. Course.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.577

Oh, Ernest.

14:41.688 --> 14:43.919
I got a round
that finishes down our road, Et.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.492
- That's nice, dear.
- I should be done about 12.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.061
Then I can get going on that old range.

14:50.864 --> 14:53.595
I'll be glad to see the back

14:54.902 --> 14:56.370
It's a pig, duck.

Good springs, look.
Newly-weds need good springs.

- Certainly not, Ernest.

Cor. It says here,
over two million unemployed.

16:17.050 --> 16:19.349
I'm lucky to be a milkman, Et.

16:19.453 --> 16:21.786
I hate coal under the stairs.

16:21.889 --> 16:26.054
Coal dust gets everywhere,
and it's so common.

16:26.193 --> 16:29.425
Oh. I'll build a brick bunker
in the garden, then.

16:30.964 --> 16:32.899
That'll be lovely.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.264
What you reckon, Et? Ho-ho!

16:35.402 --> 16:38.964
Oh, Ernest, it's far too big.

16:39.907 --> 16:41.899
I'll make some nice loose covers.

16:42.042 --> 16:45.069
Came out of a posh hotel. A bargain.

16:45.212 --> 16:49.411
I've made a curtain for under the tank.
It'll hide the pipes.

16:49.516 --> 16:52.452
I'll keep my outdoor clothes there.
The pipes will dry them off.

16:52.586 --> 16:55.283
Oh, but your coats smell of stale milk,
Ernest.

16:55.422 --> 16:57.254
Yeah, sorry.

16:58.592 --> 17:00.891
Do you think you'll ever be promoted?

17:01.028 --> 17:03.224
No blooming fear. Not me.

17:03.330 --> 17:07.199
Yard foreman? Stuck in a tin shed all day,
adding up rows of figures?

17:07.301 --> 17:10.999
Blow that for a lark.
I like the fresh air.

17:11.104 --> 17:14.802
I could have married… a deep sea diver.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.740
Well, why didn't you?

17:16.877 --> 17:20.109
Because… I didn't love him.

17:32.659 --> 17:35.322
Why do you keep that picture
of a baby on the wall?

17:35.462 --> 17:38.864
- Why do you think?
- Well, it's not a relative, is it?

17:38.966 --> 17:41.333
We've been married over two years.

Hey.

Don't cry.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.742

17:55.916 --> 17:58.943
Shush, shush, shush.

This bloke, Adolf Hitler…

18:29.182 --> 18:32.550
It says they're publishing his book
over here. Mein Kampf, it's called.

18:32.686 --> 18:34.678
Oh!

18:34.788 --> 18:36.279
That's nice of him.

18:36.390 --> 18:38.086
Huh?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.807
Et!

18:55.208 --> 18:57.109
- Surprise, dear.
- Oh.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.906
New mirror.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.244
It's lovely. How ever did you get it home?

19:02.382 --> 19:04.112
I walked it back on my bike pedal.

19:04.217 --> 19:06.015
- How much was it?
- Only half a dollar.

19:06.153 --> 19:08.019
I got it off a diddicoy down home.

19:08.155 --> 19:10.750
I've got a surprise for you, too.

19:10.924 --> 19:15.259
- Oh, yes?
- I've been to, um…

19:15.395 --> 19:16.954
the doctor.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.962
Oh. And?

19:20.767 --> 19:22.599
- You mean…?
- Mm.

19:23.403 --> 19:25.235
- We're er…
- Yeah.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.000
We're going to…

19:27.140 --> 19:28.438
Yippee!

19:28.575 --> 19:31.067
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, Et!

19:35.015 --> 19:39.282
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Oh, Ernest.

19:39.419 --> 19:42.787
And your cards,
they get bigger every year.

19:42.956 --> 19:45.653
This one's all padded.

19:45.792 --> 19:49.024
But my best present
isn't due until January.

19:49.162 --> 19:52.030
- More tea, Et?
- Mm.

19:52.165 --> 19:55.158

19:56.303 --> 19:59.171
<i>♪ Sharing the sunshine with me</i>

20:10.050 --> 20:11.848
One more push, Mrs Briggs.

20:12.018 --> 20:13.179
Ahh!

20:13.286 --> 20:16.814
- Very good.
- Goodness gracious me. What a fuss.

20:17.457 --> 20:19.983
You'll wake the neighbours, so you will.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.465
Oh, my God!

20:34.608 --> 20:35.803
Et!

20:35.909 --> 20:37.502
Wait!

20:49.489 --> 20:51.219
Steady now, Mr Briggs.

20:51.324 --> 20:54.624
You will surely not be bringing
those bottles into the birth room.

20:54.728 --> 20:57.664
Sorry, miss… madam… nurse.

20:57.764 --> 20:59.892
- Is she…?
- It's a boy.

21:00.066 --> 21:02.262
- Is she…?
- The mother is well.

21:03.904 --> 21:05.372
Oh, thank God for that.

21:07.174 --> 21:09.541
Get as much rest as you can now,
Mrs Briggs.

21:09.676 --> 21:12.771
- Baby is doing fine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.645
Hello, Doctor. Et?

21:16.750 --> 21:19.049
Oh, Ernest.

21:20.387 --> 21:21.685
Aw.

21:23.790 --> 21:26.692
- When was it?
- About five.

21:26.793 --> 21:28.887
I was just doing Ashen Grove.

21:29.963 --> 21:32.091
I nearly ran out of sterilised.

21:32.732 --> 21:35.531
How do you feel?
You… You look done in.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.194
Tired.

21:38.605 --> 21:40.403
It's all red.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.908
He! It's a "he".

21:44.010 --> 21:46.570
- Oh, yes.
- Ahem.

21:46.713 --> 21:48.909
Mr Briggs… a word.

21:49.015 --> 21:50.916
Yes, Doctor.

21:56.756 --> 21:59.521
- It was touch-and-go.
- Oh?

21:59.626 --> 22:01.754
Your wife is 38.

22:01.895 --> 22:04.421
There had better not be any more.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.531
But we wanted a proper family.

22:07.634 --> 22:11.594
More children, no more wife. I'm sorry.

22:12.772 --> 22:14.434
Good day to you.

22:30.457 --> 22:33.450
Right a bit, Et.
Don't want the nappies in the picture.

22:33.593 --> 22:36.188
That's it.

22:36.329 --> 22:37.729
Hold it.

22:37.831 --> 22:41.268
I don't have to tell you to smile.

22:46.406 --> 22:51.003
This MP's pleading that working-class
flats should be built with bathrooms.

22:51.177 --> 22:53.203
Labour MP, of course.

22:53.346 --> 22:57.807
They always say if you give the working
class a bath, they'd keep the coal in it.

22:57.951 --> 23:01.183
Oh, yeah?
I haven't noticed much coal in our bath.

23:01.288 --> 23:04.850
Ernest!
We are not working class.

23:04.991 --> 23:07.825
Huh!

23:09.963 --> 23:11.625
Oh, it's you.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.896
- Hello, Et. I've come to see the baby.
- Mm.

23:16.036 --> 23:19.438
- Come in.
- Oh, how are you, ducks?

23:19.572 --> 23:22.667
Ernest, it's your stepmother.

23:23.109 --> 23:24.099
Again.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.802
Hello, Mum.

23:25.912 --> 23:29.212
I brought you a couple
of bottles of stout.

23:29.316 --> 23:31.376
And some coal.

23:32.819 --> 23:34.981
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Mum. No need.

23:35.088 --> 23:38.786
Now, where's my little boy?

23:38.892 --> 23:41.885
Oh, ain't he grown?

23:42.028 --> 23:46.022
<i>This is the BBC

Here, Ern,
turn that blessed wireless thing off.

23:55.842 --> 23:58.710

24:10.724 --> 24:12.420

24:12.525 --> 24:16.963
Did you know, if you're a Jew in Germany,
you're forbidden to marry a German?

24:17.097 --> 24:18.690
Hm.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.768
- I would hate to marry a German.
- No…

24:27.741 --> 24:30.677
Cor, this gas copper's a real luxury.

24:30.777 --> 24:35.044
Just turn the tap and strike a match.

24:35.148 --> 24:38.880
BBC's gonna start tele-vision
later this year.

24:38.985 --> 24:41.284
What's that when it's at home?

24:41.388 --> 24:44.358
Well, it looks like a wireless set
with pictures on top of it.

24:44.491 --> 24:47.518
Moving pictures? Talkies?

24:48.294 --> 24:49.762
Yeah.

24:49.896 --> 24:52.388
It'll be like going to the pictures
without going out.

24:52.532 --> 24:55.900
What? You just sit and look at it?

24:56.002 --> 24:57.470
- Yeah.
- Hm.

24:58.772 --> 25:01.401
I suppose it might be all right
for the gentry.

25:04.778 --> 25:06.508
Ohh!

25:06.613 --> 25:08.479
Ohh!

25:10.483 --> 25:12.816
Let's see that nappy, then.

25:12.952 --> 25:14.545
Ooh!

25:14.687 --> 25:17.714
Another lot of washing.

25:19.125 --> 25:24.359
It says "The average family needs £6
a week to keep it above the poverty line".

25:24.497 --> 25:27.194
- What's the poverty line?
- Dunno.

25:27.367 --> 25:31.498
Just wish I earned £6 a week.
What with the nipper growing up so fast.

25:39.212 --> 25:41.943
Whee! Ha-ha-ha!

25:43.016 --> 25:46.578
Hey-hey! That's the way to do it, boysie!

25:46.719 --> 25:49.917
- Again! Again!
- Oh, Ernest, he's getting such a big boy.

25:50.023 --> 25:52.219
No, he's not. He's skinny, like me.

25:52.392 --> 25:55.794
Wiry, Ernest. And tall.

25:55.929 --> 25:59.161
And lovely hair. All those curls.

26:00.834 --> 26:03.394
Ooh, look, that's new.

26:03.536 --> 26:05.562
They're serving teas in The Balcony.

26:06.206 --> 26:08.869
There's waitresses in aprons and caps.

26:09.642 --> 26:11.406
It looks a bit posh.

26:12.078 --> 26:14.673
- Maybe some other time, eh, dear?
- Again!

26:14.814 --> 26:18.046
Yes. Some other time.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.821
Whatever's up, darling?

26:30.964 --> 26:32.626
What are you crying for?

26:32.765 --> 26:34.791
I've had it done.

26:34.901 --> 26:36.802
What? What?!

26:36.903 --> 26:38.166
His hair.

26:38.271 --> 26:40.763
- Eh?
- They've cut it all off!

26:40.874 --> 26:43.708
His beautiful curls.

26:43.843 --> 26:45.971
Well, blimey, it's gotta be done, Et.

26:46.079 --> 26:49.379
We can't have him running round
like a blooming girl all his life.

26:49.516 --> 26:52.315
He's not a baby any more.
He'll be off to school in no time.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.080
I know!

26:55.221 --> 26:56.849
Hello, boysie.

26:58.291 --> 27:00.317
What's wrong with Mum?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.471
Mum! Mum!

27:11.604 --> 27:14.073

Shouldn't you be in school?

27:14.207 --> 27:16.335
Mum! Mum!

27:16.509 --> 27:18.808
Whatever are you home for?

27:18.912 --> 27:22.246
You mustn't come home
in the middle of the day.

27:22.348 --> 27:25.079
Did you cross that main road?
Oh, God, you must have done.

27:25.218 --> 27:28.313
- I can't find the sit down lavatories.
- You can't find the…?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.484
We showed you them.

27:31.624 --> 27:33.320
No, they're girls. Girls sit down.

27:33.493 --> 27:36.156
No, there's boys' sitting downs, as well.

27:36.296 --> 27:38.856
No, there isn't. It's all girls.

27:38.965 --> 27:41.298
Oh, look out! I wanna go number twos!

27:43.937 --> 27:45.906
Nice day again, Mrs Bennet.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.770
Yes, lovely, Mrs Briggs.

28:02.088 --> 28:05.525
Sounds like that Hitler's on the warpath
good and proper.

28:05.658 --> 28:07.058
Mm.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.856
Just hark at them.

28:08.962 --> 28:11.522
They're all barmy.

28:12.165 --> 28:15.192
Our George was killed in the last one.

28:15.335 --> 28:17.395
And brother Tom.

28:18.972 --> 28:20.964
It doesn't seem all that long ago.

28:23.009 --> 28:25.410

28:40.426 --> 28:44.727
Dreadful. It would be like going

28:45.798 --> 28:47.699
Blimey. There's a photo here

28:47.800 --> 28:51.362
of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor
shaking hands with Hitler.

28:51.504 --> 28:54.099
Ohh! He can't be so bad, then.

Oh, yes?

29:34.247 --> 29:37.240
He says it's peace with honour.
Peace in our time.

29:37.383 --> 29:40.945

<i>I have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received…</i>

32:37.230 --> 32:42.828
<i>and that consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.</i>

32:46.038 --> 32:47.768
Blimey, duck.

32:47.940 --> 32:49.738
This is it.

32:51.077 --> 32:52.943
Mum?

33:24.210 --> 33:25.803
<i>The Government announced today</i>

33:25.978 --> 33:28.675
<i>that one and a half million children
are to be evacuated.</i>

33:28.814 --> 33:30.806
<i>Children living
in big cities and towns…</i>

33:30.983 --> 33:34.920
- No. No, they're not taking ours away.

33:35.054 --> 33:38.183
- Course they are.
- No, they're not!

33:38.291 --> 33:40.317
Over my dead body!

33:40.459 --> 33:43.190
It'll be over <i>his</i> dead body, then!
Is that what you want?

33:43.296 --> 33:44.320
No, Ernest.

33:44.463 --> 33:47.228
Well, that's exactly what will happen.
He's got to go.

33:49.502 --> 33:53.303
Oh, sorry, darling. Come on.

33:53.439 --> 33:56.034
- Don't cry.
- My little baby.

33:56.142 --> 33:57.735
Don't cry, love.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.675
I know, I know.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.629
You be a good boy, now, Raymond.

34:28.541 --> 34:30.669
Come on, then.

34:30.776 --> 34:32.745
Up you go, son, that's it.

34:35.348 --> 34:36.873
Bye, son.

34:37.049 --> 34:41.282
- We'll send you some things in the post.
- Stand clear now.

34:41.387 --> 34:43.083
I know, I know.

34:58.771 --> 35:00.535
Bye, son.

35:13.386 --> 35:15.378
He's gone.

35:15.521 --> 35:17.922
He's gone.

35:18.090 --> 35:21.925
Don't cry, darling.
He'll be safe down the country.

35:23.429 --> 35:26.422
He's only five.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.322
Ernest!

35:53.426 --> 35:56.191
Ernest, it must be from Raymond.

35:56.328 --> 35:57.660
Yes. Yes.

35:57.797 --> 36:03.964
"Dear Mum and Dad. Aunty Flo
and Aunty Betty are very nice ladies."

36:04.136 --> 36:08.073
Oh, look, he's done some drawings, too.

36:08.207 --> 36:11.473
"I sleep on a camp bed
in Aunty Flo's bedroom."

36:11.610 --> 36:14.239
Oh, poor little mite.

36:15.081 --> 36:19.485
"I get the milk in a can.
It is not in bottles, because it is cows."

36:19.618 --> 36:21.610
Milk not in bottles? Blimey.

36:21.754 --> 36:24.849
"I rode on a cart horse's back

36:24.990 --> 36:29.985
I nearly did the splits.

Is that it? Finished?

36:59.658 --> 37:03.459

- I thought they'd invaded Poland?
- Yes, they have.

37:20.312 --> 37:22.838
But you said Germany's invaded Poland.

37:22.948 --> 37:24.712
Yes, that's right.

37:24.850 --> 37:27.251
Well, who was it invaded Czechoslovakia?

37:27.353 --> 37:31.484
- Germany.
- Oh, Germany's always invading someone.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.490
I expect they'll invade Russia one day.

37:33.626 --> 37:36.061
Cor blimey, not likely. They're in league.

37:36.228 --> 37:39.687
- Or Russia will invade Germany.
- Oh, don't be daft.

37:39.832 --> 37:43.963
Well, if they all keep invading one
another, we'll end up invading someone.

37:44.103 --> 37:47.733
Oh, Et,
you just don't understand politics.

37:49.074 --> 37:51.509
Oh! Now look.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.579
Blessed shelter.

37:59.051 --> 38:02.112
Do you think they ever will come down
our road, Ernest?

38:02.288 --> 38:04.382
I expect it will be OK.

38:04.523 --> 38:08.187
They say Hitler's assured Holland
and Belgium of his friendship.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.853
Oh, that's nice.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.531
What do you think?
It's all right, eh?

38:14.667 --> 38:18.798
I thought firemen had those nice brass
helmets with curly tops.

38:18.938 --> 38:21.669
Nah.
Blokes been getting electrocuted in those.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.907
At last! Churchill's taken over.

38:26.011 --> 38:29.345
- "Blood, toil, tears and sweat."
- Ernest!

38:29.481 --> 38:31.313
Don't. Disgusting.

38:31.417 --> 38:34.012
It's your gentry talking.
His words, not mine.

38:34.153 --> 38:36.679
Yes, but he was talking
to the common people.

38:36.789 --> 38:39.554
He wouldn't use words like that
in his own home.

38:42.628 --> 38:46.759
<i>What General Weygand
has called the Battle of France is over.</i>

38:48.167 --> 38:50.762
<i>The Battle of Britain is about to begin.</i>

38:51.971 --> 38:57.603
<i>Upon this battle depends
the survival of Christian civilisation.</i>

38:57.743 --> 39:04.343
<i>The whole fury and might of the enemy

39:05.451 --> 39:10.856
<i>Hitler knows that he will have to break us

39:13.792 --> 39:18.321
<i>If we can stand up to him,
all Europe may be freed</i>

39:18.430 --> 39:24.768
<i>and the life of the world may move
forward into broad, sunlit uplands.</i>

39:27.373 --> 39:30.969
<i>But if we fail, then the whole world,</i>

39:31.076 --> 39:33.841
<i>including the United States,</i>

39:34.780 --> 39:38.547
<i>will sink into the abyss

39:41.253 --> 39:44.485
<i>Let us therefore brace ourselves
to our duties,</i>

39:44.623 --> 39:47.149
<i>and so bear ourselves,</i>

<i>that, if the British Empire

<i>last for a thousand years,
men will still say:</i>

39:57.503 --> 40:00.598
<i>"This was their finest hour."</i>

40:05.844 --> 40:09.110
"Broad, sunlit uplands."

40:09.248 --> 40:12.707
Good old Winston. "Our finest hour!"

40:23.228 --> 40:26.824
They're starting to take away
our nice gate and railings.

40:26.932 --> 40:28.924
I'll make a wooden gate.

40:29.068 --> 40:32.232
- Oh, it's a shame.
- They want saucepans, too.

40:32.404 --> 40:34.236
They make 'em into Spitfires.

40:35.274 --> 40:38.506
Funny to think of our front gate
being a Spitfire.

41:46.011 --> 41:48.947
The front door's halfway up the stairs.

41:50.215 --> 41:52.775
It's spoiled my loose covers.

41:55.687 --> 41:58.748
Could have been worse, Et.
We got off light.

41:58.891 --> 42:02.089
I'm glad Raymond
was well clear of all this.

42:02.194 --> 42:03.924
Perhaps when we've got
this mess cleared up,

42:04.029 --> 42:06.498
we could take a trip down to Dorset
and give him a visit.

42:12.971 --> 42:14.337
Mum!

42:14.506 --> 42:16.634
Dad! Look at me!

42:16.775 --> 42:18.403
Look!

42:18.577 --> 42:20.603
Raymond, be careful, dear.

42:20.746 --> 42:25.309
No need to worry about him, Ethel.
He's got quite used to things now.

42:30.222 --> 42:33.852
Phwoar! Lovely country smells, eh, boysie?

42:35.961 --> 42:38.863
Are the pigs like that
because of the blackout?

42:38.997 --> 42:40.727
Oh, Et.

42:40.833 --> 42:43.997
Ooh.

42:44.136 --> 42:46.230
Come along, Raymond. We've seen the pigs.

42:49.541 --> 42:52.807
He's fitted into the school
very well, hasn't he, Flo?

42:52.945 --> 42:55.210
It's as if he's always been here.

42:55.347 --> 42:58.146
Oh. Good.

42:58.250 --> 43:01.687
Mum, the boys at school all have boots.

43:01.820 --> 43:05.757
They're common boys, Ethel,
from Lambeth and Bermondsey.

43:05.858 --> 43:08.987
- Can I have boots?
- Certainly not, Raymond.

43:09.094 --> 43:11.063
Ohh.

43:14.433 --> 43:16.993
I've always dreamed of
a cottage in the country.

43:18.036 --> 43:20.904
Down here it's hard to believe
there's a war on.

43:21.039 --> 43:22.837
Come on, piggies.

43:31.850 --> 43:36.845
That Mr Morrison and his soppy shelter
has ruined my nice dining room.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.617
Government precautions, dear.

43:38.724 --> 43:41.091
Still, at least we won't have to go out
into the cold.

43:41.226 --> 43:44.128
You look like you're in the zoo.

43:44.263 --> 43:46.994
I'll paint it brown to tone in
with the furniture.

43:47.099 --> 43:49.830
A nice pastel brown, Ernest.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.342
- Blimey.
- What?

43:58.477 --> 44:00.412
Germany's invaded Russia!

44:01.647 --> 44:03.548
I wish I'd betted you sixpence.

44:04.850 --> 44:07.217
Oh. Night, dear.

are you doing with that ruler?

44:23.468 --> 44:25.266
Marking five inches.

44:25.370 --> 44:27.669
You're only allowed five inches of water.

44:28.941 --> 44:32.378
But if you were fat,
it would be higher up.

44:32.511 --> 44:35.504
Yeah, well, the King's done it
at Buckingham Palace.

44:35.681 --> 44:40.051
It's not fair,
fat people getting a deeper bath.

44:40.152 --> 44:42.986
They say you're supposed
to share the bath too, darling.

44:43.121 --> 44:45.750
- Disgusting.
- We share ours.

44:45.891 --> 44:47.689
But not at the same time.

45:12.718 --> 45:15.984
Don't know. Hope to God not.

We'll all chip in.
That's the whole idea.

47:12.404 --> 47:16.899
You can't chip in if you're out of work,
or off sick, or on a pension.

47:17.042 --> 47:21.537
No, well… course not.
It's all gotta be worked out.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.444

Economics will see to it.

50:09.581 --> 50:12.050
Before any more of the blighters
come over.

50:13.385 --> 50:15.786
We'd better get you
back down the country tomorrow.

50:31.736 --> 50:36.003
Crikey, dear.
Sounds like a lot got through tonight.

50:40.912 --> 50:44.246
- I can't hear anything.
- Hold tight, duck.

50:58.330 --> 51:00.856
Some shelter. Full of glass.

51:00.966 --> 51:02.935
Morrison shelters!

51:03.068 --> 51:05.537
That Mr Morrison must be a proper twerp.

51:06.504 --> 51:10.635
Good job the boy wasn't in it.
He's only been gone two days.

51:12.711 --> 51:18.776
The old Dorothy Perkins
is still in bloom. She survived.

51:18.917 --> 51:21.443
Pity he didn't take his teddy with him.

51:21.553 --> 51:24.648
Oh, Ernest.

51:24.756 --> 51:27.851
How much more of this is there gonna be?

51:48.913 --> 51:50.541
- Ernest?
- What?

51:50.682 --> 51:54.141
Careful. That's your second glass of beer.

Hm.

55:07.512 --> 55:08.878
Ohh!

55:08.980 --> 55:11.779
He's passed the scholarship!

55:11.916 --> 55:14.283
He's going to the grammar school!

55:14.419 --> 55:18.379
Hm. I hope he won't get too posh for us.

55:18.523 --> 55:20.389
Oh, Ernest!

55:46.050 --> 55:47.814

Quite so, madam.

55:50.221 --> 55:51.553
Languages, eh?

55:51.656 --> 55:55.821
Oh, yes.
He has to do French and Latin. And Maths.

55:55.960 --> 55:57.553
Oh, like arithmetic?

55:57.662 --> 56:01.565
No, not just arithmetic.
It's called alge…

56:01.666 --> 56:05.364

56:05.536 --> 56:09.268
Oh. And sport, does he do his football?

56:09.440 --> 56:10.772
Oh, no.

56:10.875 --> 56:13.640
- They play rugger.
- Ethel?

56:13.778 --> 56:15.838
Oh, sorry, must go.

56:18.583 --> 56:21.075
You shouldn't go on about it
to Mrs Bennet, dear.

56:21.219 --> 56:22.448
Why not?

56:22.587 --> 56:25.614
Well, her boy didn't get in anywhere.
He's a bricklayer now.

56:25.757 --> 56:28.090
I don't see why I shouldn't be proud

56:28.226 --> 56:30.627
Yeah? Well, well, OK.

56:42.073 --> 56:44.838

56:47.612 --> 56:50.309
- What do you reckon?
- Smashing, Dad.

56:50.448 --> 56:52.246
It's electric, son.

56:52.383 --> 56:54.648
I hope you can keep control of it, Ernest.

56:54.786 --> 56:56.084
Can I have a go on it?

56:56.220 --> 56:58.985
Just you keep away from it.
It's dangerous.

56:59.090 --> 57:00.991

57:05.663 --> 57:07.131

57:21.546 --> 57:23.037
Ta.

57:23.147 --> 57:25.275
- How goes it, then?
- Oh, not good.

57:26.351 --> 57:28.343
My old lady… she's getting a bit much.

57:28.486 --> 57:31.046
Oh?

57:31.155 --> 57:33.147

57:33.291 --> 57:35.851
No, no, no. You know…

57:35.960 --> 57:37.861
- … the other.
- Hm?

57:37.962 --> 57:41.296
It's the change. She's on the change.

57:41.432 --> 57:44.459
Too demanding.
Do you know what I mean?

57:44.635 --> 57:47.161
I can't cope. It's too much for me.

57:47.305 --> 57:52.107

57:53.277 --> 57:55.178

57:55.313 --> 57:58.112
Eh? What? You mean er…?

57:58.249 --> 58:01.947
I'll be out next Saturday. Football.
Fulham's at home. So…

58:03.087 --> 58:04.885
You mean, you…

58:05.757 --> 58:08.352
Yeah, like I say,
you'd be doing me a favour.

58:10.895 --> 58:14.855
Oh, blimey, no. No, mate.
No, I couldn't. Sorry. No.

58:14.966 --> 58:16.867
I… I got a barrow to push.

58:16.968 --> 58:19.870

1:00:03.374 --> 1:00:06.071
Yes. Yes, he did. That's right.

1:00:06.210 --> 1:00:09.078
He's been helping the police
with their investigations.

1:00:09.213 --> 1:00:11.011
In a Black Maria?

1:00:11.115 --> 1:00:14.483
Yes. He reported some stolen property
he found in the woods.

1:00:14.619 --> 1:00:18.386

he was a very clever boy.

1:00:18.489 --> 1:00:20.253

Look. More scrap Anderson.
Ah, fits perfect.

1:00:33.504 --> 1:00:36.497
We'll own all the coal soon.
They're gonna nationalise it.

1:00:36.641 --> 1:00:38.439
I bet we still have to pay for it.

1:00:38.543 --> 1:00:41.274
Well, course we'll have to pay for it,
you daft ha'porth.

1:00:41.412 --> 1:00:45.474
- So we won't own it, then, will we?
- Well, er… not exactly.

1:00:45.616 --> 1:00:47.847
But it means the profits
will go to the Government,

1:00:47.952 --> 1:00:50.012
instead of lining the pockets
of the bosses.

1:00:50.121 --> 1:00:52.522
And then the Government
gives the money to us?

1:00:52.657 --> 1:00:55.058
- No!
- So what's the difference, then?

1:00:57.328 --> 1:01:02.266
Cor! 50,000 GI brides going to America.
Kiddies with them, too.

1:01:02.366 --> 1:01:05.894
Children? But they're not married!

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:09.371
Yeah, well, I expect some of them
jumped the gun a bit.

1:01:09.507 --> 1:01:12.500
You know what they say about
the Yanks. "One yank and they're down."

1:01:15.379 --> 1:01:19.316
- What are down?
- Er, well, I dunno. It's just a saying.

1:01:31.996 --> 1:01:35.660
Wheeee!

1:01:39.003 --> 1:01:42.735
Blimey. There's gonna be
a thousand miles of motorway.

1:01:42.907 --> 1:01:45.103
A terrific network!

1:01:45.209 --> 1:01:48.873
What about the green belt?
All that lovely country.

1:01:48.980 --> 1:01:52.109
Yeah, well, it will bypass it, I expect.

1:01:52.216 --> 1:01:55.778
I thought you said there were going to be
lots of bypasses already?

1:01:55.953 --> 1:01:57.478
Yeah, well, so there are.

1:01:57.588 --> 1:02:01.320
- It will bypass the bypasses, then.
- And what about the ring roads?

1:02:01.425 --> 1:02:05.726
Look, it will bypass the ring roads
and bypass the bypasses.

1:02:05.896 --> 1:02:09.594
- And bypass the green belt?
- Yes, and bypass the green belt!

1:02:09.734 --> 1:02:11.293
That's all right, then.

1:02:13.738 --> 1:02:15.798
Only it does seem a bit of a muddle.

1:02:28.552 --> 1:02:29.918
He's passed!

1:02:30.021 --> 1:02:32.456
He's passed the school certificate!

1:02:33.758 --> 1:02:38.594
It says he's matric… matriculated,
or something.

1:02:38.729 --> 1:02:41.631
- Is that good?
- Well, of course it's good!

1:02:41.766 --> 1:02:44.395
- What does it mean?
- I don't know what it means.

1:02:44.535 --> 1:02:46.629
Not our place to know.

1:02:53.644 --> 1:02:55.943
- Morning, Mr Briggs.
- Lovely morning.

1:03:01.686 --> 1:03:05.384
Whatever's the matter, dear?

1:03:06.657 --> 1:03:11.652
He says he wants to leave
the grammar school and go to art school.

1:03:11.796 --> 1:03:14.095
Art school?

1:03:14.231 --> 1:03:17.030
- Oh, blimey.
- Such a shame.

1:03:17.168 --> 1:03:19.569
He could have gone
to Oxford and Cambridge.

1:03:19.670 --> 1:03:21.764
And got a nice job in an office.

1:03:21.872 --> 1:03:25.172
He could have been a foreman
or even, maybe, a manager.

1:03:32.249 --> 1:03:36.380
There's no money in it.
He'll never earn a living at it.

1:03:36.487 --> 1:03:39.514
That lot's all long hair, drink and…

1:03:40.991 --> 1:03:43.085
- … and nude women.
- Oh, Ernest!

1:03:46.997 --> 1:03:49.125
<i>It was confirmed today that Russia</i>

1:03:49.266 --> 1:03:51.428

1:04:00.845 --> 1:04:04.009
Ernest, do speak properly.

1:04:17.294 --> 1:04:21.163
Dad, when you come home from work,
why don't you wash in the bathroom?

1:04:21.298 --> 1:04:23.699
Blimey, son. I'm filthy, look.

1:04:23.834 --> 1:04:26.531
Yes, I know,
but that's what the bathroom is for.

1:04:26.670 --> 1:04:29.265
No, I couldn't wash in the bathroom.
Not in this state.

1:04:29.373 --> 1:04:32.468
But this is the kitchen, Dad.
Mum cooks in it.

1:04:32.576 --> 1:04:34.101
Whoo-hoo!

1:04:34.245 --> 1:04:36.111
No, I couldn't, son.
Not in the bathroom.

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:38.239
Oh, Dad!

1:04:38.349 --> 1:04:41.046
Hello, dear. Had a good day at college?

1:04:42.753 --> 1:04:47.282
- Oh, what's up with him?
- They call it ad-o-lescence, dear.

1:04:47.391 --> 1:04:48.882
They don't understand.

1:04:49.059 --> 1:04:51.358
That launderette is a godsend.

1:04:51.495 --> 1:04:55.489
I did the whole blessed lot
for two and nine. And it's all bone-dry.

1:18:37.087 --> 1:18:41.388
Son, it's the sort of place
I always dreamed about.

1:18:42.359 --> 1:18:45.124
I know, Dad. I know.

1:18:54.738 --> 1:18:58.436
They seem very happy down there,
despite the schizo business.

1:18:58.575 --> 1:19:03.946
Yes, I suppose so. I was hoping
he'd send his washing home.

1:19:04.114 --> 1:19:08.176
- Oh, Et. Don't be daft. He's married.
- Yes, I know.

1:19:08.318 --> 1:19:10.981
What's that?

1:19:11.154 --> 1:19:13.350
My retirement certificate.

1:19:13.456 --> 1:19:17.985
37 years' service with
the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society.

1:19:18.161 --> 1:19:20.926
I'm not sure I want that
on the front room wall.

1:19:21.064 --> 1:19:23.329
Well, that's where it's going, Ethel.

1:19:26.936 --> 1:19:29.770
<i>That's one small step for man…</i>

1:19:31.808 --> 1:19:34.778
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1:19:36.746 --> 1:19:40.205
Cor blimey. A man on the moon, Et.

1:19:40.350 --> 1:19:43.479
- Oh?
- A man on the moon.

1:19:44.421 --> 1:19:45.650
Fantastic, eh?

1:19:45.789 --> 1:19:47.587
What's he doing there?

1:19:47.691 --> 1:19:51.389
Well, just walking about a bit.

1:19:51.494 --> 1:19:54.896
- Then what?
- Come back, I suppose.

1:19:56.099 --> 1:19:57.897
Perhaps they'll have a picnic.

1:19:58.034 --> 1:20:00.094
That would be nice.

1:20:00.236 --> 1:20:04.469
I think the tea would blow away
when it came out of the Thermos.

1:20:04.607 --> 1:20:06.599
Why, is it windy up there?

1:20:06.710 --> 1:20:10.408
- No, it's gravity, dear.
- Oh, I see.

1:20:10.513 --> 1:20:14.974
Look, he's gonna pick up some pebbles
to take home.

1:20:15.118 --> 1:20:17.485
Just like kiddies at the seaside.

1:20:19.923 --> 1:20:21.516
Turn it off, will you?

1:20:36.072 --> 1:20:38.439
Did you have a good journey, dear?

1:20:38.541 --> 1:20:42.000
Oh, yes. OK, Mum. Fine, fine.

1:20:42.145 --> 1:20:44.205
Much traffic on the road?

1:20:44.314 --> 1:20:49.844
Well, er, the A23 was a bit choked up,
wasn't it?

1:20:49.953 --> 1:20:54.448
Um, but er… after Sutton
it sort of thinned out a bit

1:20:54.557 --> 1:20:58.653
and, er… you know, got better.

1:21:02.532 --> 1:21:04.558
Here's a comb, dear.

1:21:08.271 --> 1:21:09.762
Thanks, Mum.

1:21:19.549 --> 1:21:22.246
Remember we used to
bring the pram up here?

1:21:22.952 --> 1:21:25.046
It's me in the pram now.

1:21:26.189 --> 1:21:29.751
They used to do nice teas in The Balcony
before the war.

1:21:30.593 --> 1:21:33.085
Waitresses in aprons and caps.

1:21:34.297 --> 1:21:38.564
- Never did go, did we, dear?
- Yes. It was lovely.

1:21:40.737 --> 1:21:43.605
The yobbos smashed all the windows.

1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:46.539
Well, that's your Labour Party for you.

1:21:59.989 --> 1:22:02.356
- Mr Briggs. Mr Briggs.
- What?

1:22:02.492 --> 1:22:04.859
Is there a telephone?
I need to call an ambulance.

1:22:05.028 --> 1:22:07.293
Downstairs, Doctor. Front room.

1:22:11.301 --> 1:22:12.735
Ethel?

1:22:27.650 --> 1:22:30.814
Why are they all staring at me?

1:22:33.022 --> 1:22:35.787
Oh, they're not staring at you, Mum.
It's the television.

1:22:35.925 --> 1:22:38.019
Put it right by your bed.

1:22:39.329 --> 1:22:43.994
I don't like them staring at me.
And I don't like being in Charity Ward.

1:22:44.133 --> 1:22:48.195
It doesn't mean "charity", Mum.
It's a girl's name.

1:22:49.172 --> 1:22:53.473
What's that music? I can hear music.

1:22:53.610 --> 1:22:58.674
Carols, Mum. On the television.
It's Christmas. There's the tree, look.

1:22:59.782 --> 1:23:03.048
Oh, I hope I'll be home
in time for Christmas.

1:23:04.354 --> 1:23:07.654
- When is it?
- It was yesterday, Mum.

1:23:07.790 --> 1:23:09.782
You had your presents yesterday.

1:23:19.068 --> 1:23:23.062
Look at all your cards, hm?
Lovely flowers.

1:23:23.206 --> 1:23:27.371
Yes, lovely. Ain't I a lucky girl?

1:23:33.383 --> 1:23:35.249
Listen, dear.

1:23:36.686 --> 1:23:40.054
Who was that old man in here just now?

1:23:40.189 --> 1:23:43.091
Oh, Mum. That was Dad.

1:23:43.860 --> 1:23:45.658
Dad?

1:23:45.795 --> 1:23:49.789
You know, Ernest. Your husband.

1:23:49.899 --> 1:23:53.700
- My husband?
- Yes.

1:23:54.470 --> 1:23:58.237
- Not Victor McLaglen?
- No, Mum.

1:23:58.408 --> 1:24:00.809
I thought he was dead.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.907
Lovely… Lovely flowers, Mum.

1:24:07.050 --> 1:24:10.714
Oh, yes, lovely.

1:24:10.853 --> 1:24:13.652
Ain't I a lucky girl?

1:24:31.741 --> 1:24:34.905
- Son? Is that you?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1:24:35.044 --> 1:24:38.446
The hospital. They just phoned.

1:24:38.548 --> 1:24:39.846
<i>Oh, right.</i>

1:24:39.949 --> 1:24:41.679
She's…

1:24:43.119 --> 1:24:46.556
- I'm going up there.
<i>- I'll leave now.</i>

1:24:46.689 --> 1:24:50.592
- OK. I'll see you there.
<i>- Bye, Dad.</i>

1:24:50.727 --> 1:24:52.855
Steady on, old son.

1:24:53.963 --> 1:24:55.898
Steady on.

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:21.118
- Why is she on a trolley?
- I don't know, son.

1:25:21.224 --> 1:25:24.194
Look, bloody tissues and Vim
right by her face.

1:25:25.361 --> 1:25:28.957
- They've put her teeth in all crooked.
- I know, son.

1:25:31.534 --> 1:25:33.025
I don't know.

1:25:46.249 --> 1:25:49.185
I still keep laying the table for two,
duck.

1:25:51.554 --> 1:25:53.523
Daft, isn't it, Susie, puss?

1:25:59.429 --> 1:26:01.364
Nice daffs, aren't they?

1:26:13.976 --> 1:26:17.037
<i>… retailers tell the Government
they accept the need…</i>

1:26:17.180 --> 1:26:19.081
I'll get cocoa in a minute, dear.

1:26:30.193 --> 1:26:31.957
Good night, Susie.

1:26:44.807 --> 1:26:46.298
Argh!

1:26:46.442 --> 1:26:47.967
Ohh!

1:26:49.212 --> 1:26:51.772
Argh!

1:26:51.881 --> 1:26:55.409
Argh!

1:27:06.529 --> 1:27:08.794
It's OK, Susie.

1:28:30.713 --> 1:28:34.013
I suppose I better get the Salvation Army
to take it all away.

1:28:56.305 --> 1:28:58.331
I grew it from a pip.
