THIS IS THE RIGHT SPOT?

BE SO BIG AND
STILL BE LEGAL.

THE SAME SIZE WE
MADE THE OTHER 3.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.756

IS RIGHT HERE,

54:32.894 --> 54:34.061

54:34.229 --> 54:37.439
JUST HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU THINK
WE'LL BE HERE?

54:39.567 --> 54:44.154
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE DO,
YOU KNOW?

54:44.322 --> 54:46.949
UNTIL WE GET ENOUGH.

54:47.117 --> 54:53.914
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF PEOPLE KNOW WHEN
THEY HAVE ENOUGH.

54:54.082 --> 54:57.751
OH, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
THE STORY THE OLD HERMIT
TOLD LAURA TODAY.

54:57.919 --> 54:59.044
YES.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.046
WELL, I WOULDN'T
TAKE THAT AS THE GOSPEL.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.090
I MEAN, EVEN LAURA SAID
HE WAS A STRANGE ONE.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.551
HIM SAYING HE BURIED
ALL THAT GOLD.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.512
BET HE NEVER FOUND ANY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.474
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.980
WE WILL BE OUT OF HERE
BY WINTER.

55:21.818 --> 55:24.153

CLOSED YOUR EYES,
BOWED YOUR HEADS TONIGHT,

1:26:48.661 --> 1:26:50.996
AND ASKED
THE GOOD LORD TO...

1:26:51.164 --> 1:26:53.957
HELP YOU STRIKE IT RICH.

1:26:54.125 --> 1:26:56.335
WHOEVER DID,
JUST RAISE THEIR HAND.

1:27:00.006 --> 1:27:02.007
COME ON. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE
ANYTHING WHILE WE'RE IN CHURCH,

1:27:02.175 --> 1:27:03.967
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE HONEST.

1:27:04.135 --> 1:27:05.510
I KNOW I DID IT
WHEN I CAME HERE.

1:27:05.678 --> 1:27:07.346
SURELY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

1:27:25.114 --> 1:27:26.782
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

1:27:29.619 --> 1:27:30.702
YOU KNOW, BEFORE I CAME HERE,

1:27:30.870 --> 1:27:33.872
I NEVER DREAMED ABOUT
ASKING GOD FOR WEALTH.

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:38.377
HAPPINESS, YES,
AND GOOD HEALTH FOR MY FAMILY,

1:27:38.544 --> 1:27:41.296
STRENGTH OF SPIRIT,
BUT NOT WEALTH.

1:27:44.008 --> 1:27:46.885
WELL, WHEN YOU COME TO A PLACE
LIKE THIS, YOU CHANGE.

1:27:47.053 --> 1:27:49.304
SOME FOLKS MORE THAN OTHERS,
BUT YOU CHANGE.

1:27:51.557 --> 1:27:54.810
AND YOU SEE THE PEOPLE
AROUND YOU CHANGE, TOO.

1:27:56.479 --> 1:28:00.399
YOU SEE FOLKS THINKING MORE AND
MORE ABOUT THE WEALTH OF GOLD

1:28:00.566 --> 1:28:03.694
AND LESS AND LESS
ABOUT THE REAL WEALTH--

1:28:03.861 --> 1:28:07.281
YOUR LOVED ONES...

1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:10.826
YOUR FRIENDS...

1:28:15.206 --> 1:28:16.999
AND EVEN YOUR GOD.

1:28:19.085 --> 1:28:23.297
SO WHEN I BOWED MY HEAD TONIGHT,
I DIDN'T ASK FOR GOLD.

1:28:25.008 --> 1:28:28.969
I ASKED GOD TO GIVE ME
THE STRENGTH TO FORGET ABOUT IT,

1:28:29.137 --> 1:28:31.805
TO TURN MY BACK ON IT...

1:28:33.099 --> 1:28:35.642
AND TO LET ME
TAKE MY FAMILY HOME.

1:28:39.105 --> 1:28:41.857
AND STANDING UP HERE TONIGHT...

1:28:42.025 --> 1:28:44.818
SPEAKING TO YOU,
HE'S GIVEN ME THAT STRENGTH.

1:28:49.157 --> 1:28:51.366
AND WE ARE GOING HOME.

1:28:54.829 --> 1:28:57.331
GOD BE WITH ALL OF YOU.

1:29:28.196 --> 1:29:29.571
AMEN.

1:29:45.463 --> 1:29:46.546
WHOA.

1:29:46.714 --> 1:29:48.090
GOOD DAY TO YOU,
NEIGHBOR.

1:29:48.257 --> 1:29:49.132
Charles: GOOD DAY.

1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:50.717
SAY, ARE WE ANYWHERE
NEAR NEWTON?

1:29:50.885 --> 1:29:52.386
YOU JUST GO STRAIGHT
AHEAD UNTIL YOU GET
TO THOSE HILLS.

1:29:52.553 --> 1:29:53.470
ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS.

1:29:53.638 --> 1:29:55.138
ARE THEY HAVING
ANY LUCK THERE?

1:29:55.306 --> 1:29:57.557
YOU MEAN ARE THEY
FINDING ANY COLOR.
YES, MA'AM, THEY ARE.

1:29:57.725 --> 1:29:58.725
HEY, I TOLD YOU.

1:29:58.893 --> 1:30:00.685
SAY, WE'RE HOPING
TO STRIKE IT RICH.

1:30:00.853 --> 1:30:01.853
YOU BEEN PANNING?

1:30:02.021 --> 1:30:03.188
YEAH, WE HAVE.

1:30:03.356 --> 1:30:04.981
DID YOU HIT IT BIG?

1:30:06.901 --> 1:30:08.693
YEAH.

1:30:08.861 --> 1:30:10.112
WELL, MAYBE IT'S OUR TURN.

1:30:10.279 --> 1:30:12.197
JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS,
YOU SAY?

1:30:12.365 --> 1:30:13.532
THAT'S RIGHT.

1:30:13.699 --> 1:30:14.866
THANK YOU, NEIGHBOR.

1:30:15.034 --> 1:30:15.867
THANK YOU.

1:30:16.035 --> 1:30:17.536
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1:30:17.703 --> 1:30:19.496
THANKS. HYAH.

1:30:22.667 --> 1:30:24.167
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
TOLD THEM WHAT'S AHEAD.

1:30:24.335 --> 1:30:26.920
YOU REALLY THINK
THEY WOULD HAVE
CHANGED THEIR MIND?
