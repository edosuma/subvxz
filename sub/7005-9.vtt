00:00.766 --> 00:02.633
Chicago, chicago.
<i>Tool time.</i>

00:02.634 --> 00:05.002
<i>Tool time.</i>
The windy city.

00:05.003 --> 00:08.173
<i>Tool time</i> breaks wind
in chicago.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.240
I don't know.

00:09.241 --> 00:11.776
You're still working?

00:11.777 --> 00:14.279
Yeah. Al was no help,
so I sent him home.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.582
I promised bud I'd have these
chicago <i>tool time</i> ideas
by Friday.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.784
Feel like pitchi''
some ideas to me?

00:19.785 --> 00:22.087
It's the middle of the night.
Middle of the night.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.755
Got it! A salute
to the middle of the night
in chicago. No.

00:24.756 --> 00:26.757
Honey, why don't you
just come to bed?

00:26.758 --> 00:28.826
Bed, bed, bed. Box springs.
Bedding, bedding.

00:28.827 --> 00:31.662
Tim, you're obsessing.
Obsessing, obsessing.

00:31.663 --> 00:35.100
Recess. Recessed lighting.
A salute to recessed lighting
in chicago. Recessed lighting.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.102
Buildings.
Recessed lighting.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.104
You can start again
in the morning.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.938
I'll be up in a minute.

00:40.939 --> 00:42.940
That's what you've been saying
for three weeks,

00:42.941 --> 00:45.276
And every night,
I'm sitting up there
all by myself.

00:45.277 --> 00:47.144
I'm sorry about that.

00:47.145 --> 00:50.448
If it'll make you feel
any better, you're not
the only one I'm neglecting.

00:50.449 --> 00:52.783
Eddie called from the garage,
harry from the hardware store.

00:52.784 --> 00:55.386
They're really upset.

00:59.391 --> 01:03.728
Maybe the three of us
should start a support group.

01:03.729 --> 01:07.399
Look, I know that this
chicago <i>tool time</i> thing
is important to you,

01:07.400 --> 01:10.801
But so is
our relationship.

01:10.802 --> 01:12.970
I know that.

01:12.971 --> 01:16.508
Can you remember
the last time we made love?

01:16.509 --> 01:18.009
Sunday.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.578
A month ago.

01:20.579 --> 01:22.447
A month ago Sunday.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.386
It used to be if we
went two days, you'd be
climbing the walls.

01:28.387 --> 01:30.388
Walls, stucco.
Salute to stucco.

01:30.389 --> 01:32.623
I could do
a whole wall thing.
Tim!

01:32.624 --> 01:35.326
Come on. Every marriage

01:35.327 --> 01:37.496
Goes through
these down times.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.631
Well, I'm wondering
when your downtime

01:39.632 --> 01:41.699
Is gonna be
coming back up.

01:47.373 --> 01:50.508
It's both of us.
I been working so hard,
you been at school.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.144
That's no excuse.
I just read this survey.

01:53.145 --> 01:55.880
It said that that some couples,
no matter how busy they are,

01:55.881 --> 01:59.151
Still make love
five times a week.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.185
With each other?

02:02.421 --> 02:04.456
Yeah.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.959
Yeah, I'm serious.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.161
Five nights a week?

02:10.162 --> 02:13.732
I'm surprised they have
the energy for the survey.

02:13.733 --> 02:17.235
I'm saying that we could
make more effort.

02:17.236 --> 02:20.037
I made effort
the other morning,
you weren't interested.

02:20.038 --> 02:23.575
Well, maybe it
had something to do
with your approach.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.910
What was wrong
with my approach?

02:25.911 --> 02:27.912
I believe
your exact words were,

02:27.913 --> 02:30.282
"honey, I've got three minutes.
Let's go."

02:32.484 --> 02:35.553
How much time
do you need?

02:39.859 --> 02:42.761
More than three minutes.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.697
Enough time
to connect emotionally,

02:45.698 --> 02:47.966
Feel romantic.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.636
Is there any way you can
get some of this stuff done
before I get there?

03:59.571 --> 04:02.740
So this girl
follows you around
the whole day?

04:02.741 --> 04:05.043
Even at recess.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.778
Sounds like she's got
the hots for you, mark.

04:07.779 --> 04:10.415
I know. How do I
get rid of her?

04:10.416 --> 04:14.552
Just be yourself.

04:14.553 --> 04:18.188
Mark, if you have
any questions about girls,
you shouldn't be asking randy.

04:18.189 --> 04:20.291
You should ask somebody
who knows.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.193
Right. Wilson.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.431
Wilson.

04:30.936 --> 04:32.270
Brad...

04:32.271 --> 04:34.171
What?

04:39.478 --> 04:42.713
What about a salute
to under the -
no, I didn't like that.

04:42.714 --> 04:44.548
What about -
no, no.

04:44.549 --> 04:46.550
Hey, dad. How are
the <i>tool times</i> coming?

04:46.551 --> 04:49.653
We got plenty of ideas.
Actually, thousands of 'em.
Whole bunch of 'em.

04:49.654 --> 04:52.190
You got nothing.
Zilch.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.025
Yeah, but we will,

04:54.026 --> 04:57.028
And I'm not leaving here
until we get ten good ideas.

04:57.029 --> 05:00.999
You know, maybe what we need
is a young, fresh perspective.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.535
Brad, what would you
like to see on <i>tool time?</i>

05:04.536 --> 05:06.804
A salute to heidi.

05:18.483 --> 05:21.485
Um, do you -

05:21.486 --> 05:23.487
Kids.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.157
Want something to drink?

05:27.158 --> 05:29.093
Iced tea.

05:29.094 --> 05:31.428
Right. Let's get going.
Come on.

05:31.429 --> 05:33.698
Gotta hurry up. I wanna
finish this whole thing
by 11:00 tonight.

05:33.699 --> 05:35.300
What happens at eleven?

05:35.301 --> 05:38.036
I got some work to do
upstairs.

05:39.738 --> 05:41.739
What do you gotta do?

05:41.740 --> 05:43.974
Somethin' with jill.

05:43.975 --> 05:45.276
What?

05:45.277 --> 05:48.179
Use your imagination.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.415
You mean - oh...

05:52.684 --> 05:54.852
Have marital relations.

05:56.988 --> 06:00.925
You make it sound so dirty.

06:00.926 --> 06:03.194
Apparently jill
read some survey

06:03.195 --> 06:05.563
Where there are couples
who get romantic

06:05.564 --> 06:07.699
Five nights a week.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.668
Five nights a week?
Is that legal?

06:12.438 --> 06:16.141
Apparently. Now I gotta
find time to be with her
five nights a week.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.409
No, tim.
Yes, whether
I want to or not.

06:20.545 --> 06:21.813
Tim...

06:21.814 --> 06:23.281
Al.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.783
No.
Jill?

06:24.784 --> 06:25.784
Yeah.

06:32.724 --> 06:35.460
Yes, that's me,
your wife,

06:35.461 --> 06:38.596
Whether I wanna be or not.

06:38.597 --> 06:41.532
You know, as much as
I'd like to stay,

06:41.533 --> 06:44.034
I think I'd like to leave
even more.
No, no.

06:44.035 --> 06:46.504
It's all right.
I was telling him
about that survey

06:46.505 --> 06:48.907
Where you thought
we should make love
five nights a week.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.241
I never said that.

06:50.242 --> 06:52.076
You said
we should be like
those other couples.

06:52.077 --> 06:54.579
All I said was
that I'd like it

06:54.580 --> 06:56.714
If it was more than
once a month.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.221
Ilene and I
are once-a-weekers.

07:08.794 --> 07:11.262
And tonight's the night.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.005
All right, this one
is surefire.

07:21.006 --> 07:23.007
Some enthusiasm.
Sell it, man, sell it.

07:23.008 --> 07:26.144
Our potential audience
in chicago is what?

07:26.145 --> 07:28.913
Half apartment dwellers.
For them, a big issue
is what?

07:28.914 --> 07:31.449
Cockroaches.
No. Safety.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.684
Picture this -

07:32.685 --> 07:35.587
A <i>tool time</i> salute
to peepholes.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.856
You gotta do better.
Bud'll be here any minute.

07:38.857 --> 07:41.192
All right. Ok, ok.
Chicago apartments.

07:41.193 --> 07:43.261
Every apartment
has what?

07:43.262 --> 07:44.529
Cockroaches.

07:44.530 --> 07:48.599
Fire escapes. Fire escapes
as urban patios.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.904
Yes, I see ferns,
I see bird feeders.

07:52.905 --> 07:56.207
I see every apartment dweller
throwing their tv
out the window.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.542
Whoa.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.977
Hey, guys.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.179
Hey, boss.
How's it going?

08:01.180 --> 08:04.015
Good to see ya. Al.
Hey.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.251
Were you a little late
this morning?

08:06.252 --> 08:09.720
Yeah. But my mother
had a problem.

08:09.721 --> 08:12.891
She broke down
on the interstate
and had to be towed.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.126
Oh. Sounds like
quite an ordeal.

08:15.127 --> 08:19.264
Especially since
she doesn't have a car.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.365
Tim, it's Friday.
What have you got?

08:21.366 --> 08:23.901
I bet you got so many ideas,
you don't know where to start.

08:23.902 --> 08:26.537
Right, boss. I don't know
where to start.

08:26.538 --> 08:30.575
A lot of people in chicago
are apartment dwellers.
Al...

08:30.576 --> 08:32.308
Wait. No, that's true.

08:32.309 --> 08:34.178
In fact, the research shows

08:34.179 --> 08:37.347
That 53% of our target audience
lives in apartments.

08:37.349 --> 08:38.850
53%.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.453
That's right. That's exactly
why I came up with this.

08:42.453 --> 08:45.056
Chicago apartment dwellers
have what?

08:45.057 --> 08:48.526
Cockroaches?
No, no!

08:48.527 --> 08:51.261
Fire escapes.
Picture this -

08:51.262 --> 08:54.365
Fire escapes
as urban patios.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.267
I like it.

08:57.268 --> 09:00.404
Oh, hey!
That was my idea.

09:00.405 --> 09:04.107
Al... We're a team.
There's no "I" in the word team.

09:04.108 --> 09:07.845
No, but there's a "u"
in "you always take
the credit."

09:07.846 --> 09:12.282
There's also a "w" in
"who cares?" huh?

09:12.283 --> 09:15.553
Let's go over your ideas
so tim and I can present 'em

09:15.554 --> 09:18.255
To the chicago
station manager tomorrow.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.090
We're doing that today.

09:20.091 --> 09:22.092
No. Mike
can't make it today.

09:22.093 --> 09:25.163
I can't make it tomorrow.
Why not?

09:25.164 --> 09:26.964
I got in a fight
with jill,

09:26.965 --> 09:29.300
And I told her I'd take her
to that new japanese hotel
downtown.

09:29.301 --> 09:32.302
Oh, the old
save-the-relationship
weekend.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.572
We've all had those,
yeah.

09:34.573 --> 09:37.542
You can understand why it'd be
impossible for me to show up
for a business meeting.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.876
Absolutely.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.577
I'll bring
the meeting to you.
No.

09:40.578 --> 09:44.848
Yeah. Hotel bar, 5:00 sharp,
you be there.

09:44.849 --> 09:48.119
Oh, this is so beautiful.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.687
I can see why you always
wanted to come to this hotel.

09:50.688 --> 09:54.425
Great view. The -
where are we supposed to sit?

09:56.561 --> 09:58.429
On the floor.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.965
This is an authentic
japanese bedroom.

10:00.966 --> 10:04.535
Where's the authentic
japanese bed?

10:04.536 --> 10:08.672
Well, I assume
it's in the closet.

10:08.673 --> 10:13.944
Yes. We take these futons out
and put them on the floor
where we wanna sleep.

10:20.018 --> 10:24.121
Well, we sit on the floor,
we sleep on the floor.

10:24.122 --> 10:26.290
I'm afraid to look
in the bathroom.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.462
No, don't step up here.
You have to take
your shoes off first.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.464
You know, we should
go get a massage.

10:33.465 --> 10:35.500
I'm not much
for massages.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.236
If I'm getting oiled,
I want it done
by a licensed mechanic.

10:41.005 --> 10:45.043
Well, maybe you should
go away for a weekend
with your mechanic.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.677
Way ahead of you.

10:46.678 --> 10:49.680
Chuck and I are booked
into a bed and breakfast
for valentine's day.

10:49.681 --> 10:53.184
If you don't want to take
a massage, we could soak
in a hot tub together.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.319
Now you're talkin'.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.756
Yes. A nice, long,
leisurely bath.

10:58.757 --> 11:00.658
Then a long, leisurely
frolic in the futons

11:00.659 --> 11:03.293
Till about 5:00 sharp.

11:03.294 --> 11:06.063
5:00 sharp? What,
are you scheduling
our frolicking?

11:06.064 --> 11:10.134
No. That's when
all the restaurants
open downstairs.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.136
I wanna pick
the right one.

11:12.137 --> 11:15.139
Oh, this is gonna be
so wonderful.

11:17.275 --> 11:20.578
<i>(phone rings)</i>

11:20.579 --> 11:24.348
I'll get the hot tub,
you get the phone.

11:24.349 --> 11:26.951
<i>(ring)</i>

11:26.952 --> 11:29.887
<i>(water runs)</i>

11:29.888 --> 11:30.988
Hello?

11:30.989 --> 11:32.890
<i>Hey, tim?</i>
Bud?

11:32.891 --> 11:36.094
Yeah. Listen,
slight change of plans.
Mike wanted to meet early.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.496
Early? What do you mean,
early?

11:38.497 --> 11:41.732
He promised his wife
they'd go out
for a romantic dinner.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.734
<i>(under his breath)</i>
I don't care.

11:43.735 --> 11:47.604
I promised my wife we'd play
"hide the soap in the hot tub."

11:47.605 --> 11:51.275
One of you guys
are gonna break your promise,
and it's not him.

11:51.276 --> 11:53.277
Now get your butt
down here.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.579
We gotta talk about this, bud.

11:57.949 --> 12:00.151
Who was that
on the phone?

12:00.152 --> 12:02.853
The front desk.
They forgot to give us
our complimentary kimonos.

12:02.854 --> 12:04.956
I'm gonna run down
and get 'em.

12:04.957 --> 12:08.425
Why don't they send 'em up?
They're very busy.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.595
I'm in a hurry to get mine,

12:11.596 --> 12:14.999
'cause I'm really into this
japanese style thing.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.835
<i>Sayonara,</i> alligator.

12:25.643 --> 12:27.044
Oh.

12:29.681 --> 12:32.549
<i>(both laugh)</i>

12:32.550 --> 12:34.651
Oh, that -
it's true.

12:34.652 --> 12:36.653
Wait. Tim, come here.

12:36.654 --> 12:40.424
Listen, I want you
to meet mike mckewen.

12:40.425 --> 12:42.426
Mike mckewen, tim taylor.
Good to meet ya.

12:42.427 --> 12:46.063
Forget the shaking.
Give me a hug.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.899
I'm not much of
a hugging guy, thanks.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.167
The man wants a hug.
Give him a hug.

12:51.836 --> 12:55.339
All right. Yeah. Here,
come on, sit down.

12:58.810 --> 13:02.112
Tim, your show's
got a lot of local flavor.

13:02.113 --> 13:04.514
Thanks. We work really hard
to make it feel that way.

13:04.515 --> 13:06.684
I got a big problem
with that.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.287
Gone. Over with.
Don't have to have it. Done.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.287
Love this guy.

13:10.288 --> 13:12.289
Oh, I loved him
first.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.858
See, you make a lot
of references to detroit,

13:14.859 --> 13:16.994
And how is that
gonna play in chicago?

13:16.995 --> 13:18.929
We're sensitive
to your concerns,

13:18.930 --> 13:21.632
Which is why we're
gonna give the show
a more national appeal.

13:21.633 --> 13:22.900
Good to hear it.

13:22.901 --> 13:24.902
What do you say
we forget these drinks

13:24.903 --> 13:26.838
And talk about this while
we're getting a shiatsu?

13:26.839 --> 13:30.240
As much as I like shopping
for small yapping dogs...

13:37.715 --> 13:40.785
...I'm a little pressed
for time.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.355
A shiatsu is a massage.

13:44.356 --> 13:47.558
Then I'd much rather shop
for a small yapping dog.

13:47.559 --> 13:49.427
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.329
Aw, tim's kidding.
He'd love to go
for a massage.

13:52.330 --> 13:55.365
Oh, good, 'cause I've signed
some of my biggest deals
in the massage room

13:55.366 --> 13:57.535
With nothing but a towel
covering my butt.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.804
I hate to think
where you keep your pen.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.105
<i>(all laugh)</i>

14:01.106 --> 14:03.774

14:24.262 --> 14:25.930
Where are you?

14:25.931 --> 14:28.032
I'm still here
in the lobby.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.935
You wouldn't believe the line
for these free kimonos.

14:33.271 --> 14:37.041
Well, forget about it.
With what I've got in mind,
we don't need kimonos.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.251
Uh, that's two guys

14:48.252 --> 14:50.554
Fighting over
the last extra-large.

14:53.424 --> 14:58.195
I'm gonna see
if I can't help out,
and I'll call you back.

14:58.196 --> 15:02.566
Oh, yoshiko,
that is so glorious.

15:08.706 --> 15:09.874
Wilson?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.176
Tim?

15:14.312 --> 15:16.380
What are you doing here?

15:16.381 --> 15:18.382
I come here once a month

15:18.383 --> 15:20.817
For an herbal facial
and an acupressure massage.

15:20.818 --> 15:22.819
What are you doing here?

15:22.820 --> 15:24.821
I'm here for
a romantic weekend with jill.

15:24.822 --> 15:27.257
Oh, ho-ho. Where is she?

15:27.258 --> 15:30.194
She's up in the room
by herself.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.496
That sounds very romantic.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.665
Well, I, uh...

15:34.666 --> 15:36.734
Kind of got roped into
a business meeting,

15:36.735 --> 15:38.769
So I made an excuse
and slipped down here.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.971
Well, I'm reminded
of a japanese saying:

15:40.972 --> 15:45.542
<i>(speaks japanese)</i>

15:45.543 --> 15:48.078
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:48.079 --> 15:49.380
What does that mean?

15:49.381 --> 15:53.751
Roughly, "liar, liar,
kimono on fire."

15:56.288 --> 15:59.956
So, mike,
what kind of massage
do you prefer?

15:59.957 --> 16:01.625
Oh, deep tissue.

16:01.626 --> 16:02.693
Me too.

16:02.694 --> 16:04.327
Yeah, yeah.

16:04.328 --> 16:08.065
All right, deep as you go and
as fast as you can get there.

16:08.066 --> 16:11.468
Tim, you ever had
one of these massages
before?

16:11.469 --> 16:12.770
No.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.406
They're kinda painful
if you're not used to it.

16:15.407 --> 16:19.009
Look at the size of the woman.
How much pain can she inflict?

16:19.010 --> 16:22.146
Ow! Ow!

16:22.147 --> 16:24.247
Oh...

16:24.248 --> 16:27.617
Oh...

16:27.618 --> 16:30.487
Aah!

16:35.760 --> 16:39.196
Tim, these masseuses
really get the blood flowing,
don't they?

16:39.197 --> 16:42.399
Yeah. I just wish
she was a little heavier.

16:44.136 --> 16:48.505
So, mike, what do you think?
We got ourselves a deal?

16:48.506 --> 16:51.409
I think we're gettin' there.
What do you think, tim?

16:51.410 --> 16:52.475
Yeah!

16:54.345 --> 16:56.346
I just wish she'd hurry up.

16:56.347 --> 16:59.083
I think she's
putting footprints
on my liver.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.785
What do you say
we go back to the bar

17:01.786 --> 17:04.621
And see if we
can seal this deal
over some saké?

17:04.622 --> 17:06.990
That's a good idea.

17:06.991 --> 17:08.559

17:23.007 --> 17:24.907
I called the front desk,

17:24.909 --> 17:29.246
And they said
they don't give away
complimentary kimonos.

17:29.247 --> 17:32.049
Well, not anymore.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.418
After that big fight.
You know what
they're calling it?

17:34.419 --> 17:38.089
