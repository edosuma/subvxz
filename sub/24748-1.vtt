00:27.094 --> 00:28.560
Just put all of us
into your work.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.795
That's all that counts,
isn't it?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.296
Alma, calm down.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.565
I have no choice.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.134
You know this.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.869
<i>Opening night.</i>

00:36.871 --> 00:38.437
Alma, don't go.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.505
You just told me to.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.840
I need to work, but...

00:41.842 --> 00:44.576
not with you turning on me
because of it.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.846
<i>Sorry if I sound tense.</i>

00:47.848 --> 00:51.350
<i>The experience of directing my
play really got under my skin.</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:55.354
<i>What does a director do?</i>

00:55.356 --> 00:57.423
<i>They teach characters
how to walk,</i>

00:57.425 --> 00:59.725
<i>and tell them where to go
on the stage.</i>

01:01.328 --> 01:03.262
<i>They become obsessed
with the author.</i>

01:05.132 --> 01:06.698
<i>Jacqueline, the writer.</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:12.771
<i>Tonight, critics and audiences
will give it their own meaning.</i>

01:12.773 --> 01:16.708
<i>Other people who always think they
know us better than we know ourselves.</i>

01:17.978 --> 01:19.344
It is all I have.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.581
To make sense of any of this.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.318
<i>But just now
something emerged to me.</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:30.889
<i>I did miss something,</i>

01:30.891 --> 01:32.291
<i>didn't I?</i>

02:15.669 --> 02:17.903
¶

03:12.293 --> 03:16.028
<i>Four months earlier, I don't remember
who first gave me her book to read.</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:17.262
<i>But I read it.</i>

03:17.264 --> 03:19.731
<i>I didn't understand
most of it. Who did?</i>

03:20.701 --> 03:22.534
<i>But I couldn't resist
meeting the woman</i>

03:22.536 --> 03:25.537
<i>who on one hand is
writing about one thing,</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:28.179
<i>and then it turns out she's writing
about another thing entirely.</i>

03:31.478 --> 03:33.178
Hello. Are you Jacqueline?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.446
Hi.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.648
- You must be Skene?
- I am.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.452
That is... quite a pile.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.888
Yes, I'm sorry...

03:42.890 --> 03:44.356
about the mess.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.658
Let's just say I'm prolific.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.893
So it would seem.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.930
Well, I've read the outline.
It's...

03:52.967 --> 03:54.766
It's curious.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.070
I've never heard of anybody writing
an early 20th century historical play

03:58.072 --> 04:00.305
based on their own
21st century experiences.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.506
You know, as I said,

04:01.508 --> 04:03.709
it's not all my experiences.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.178
In some cases, I was just
filling in the blanks.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.547
Exploring. What if?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.215
It's surprising
how real it can get.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.417
I like how things
mirror each other.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.852
I'm so happy you're here.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.355
I, I really... I could use
a dedicated director.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.956
I've written books,
but I'm new to plays.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.091
Well, I... I feel like...

04:20.094 --> 04:21.827
in order to do it justice,

04:21.829 --> 04:24.062
I'd need to know a little
bit more about the concept.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.731
So maybe you can
walk me through?

04:26.533 --> 04:27.533
Okay.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.636
Here's your tea.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.104
Thank you.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.640
- Hey, you have to go.
- I'm going.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.809
You go out and
you conquer Goliath.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.077
Do your job as a man.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.612
Don't remind me.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.016
I know. I really appreciate it.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.656
Bye, sweetheart.
Have a good day.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.890
- Thanks.
- Okay?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.794
¶

05:01.969 --> 05:03.502
¶

05:41.508 --> 05:42.808
I still love him.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.876
But he wants to be in
that little sea town,

05:44.878 --> 05:46.912
and I want to be successful
in the city.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.382
Just go with your heart.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.983
My heart...

05:52.486 --> 05:54.152
plays tricks on me.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.420
How about yours?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.089
My heart?

05:58.592 --> 06:01.326
You know, women are always wanting
to visit me in here, but,

06:01.328 --> 06:03.028
I only wanna see you.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.630
I don't wanna waste any time.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.300
Do you miss sex?

06:11.438 --> 06:13.105
Everybody asks that.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.840
What, are people crazy?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.541
Do you think about it
all the time?

06:16.543 --> 06:19.044
I think more about food.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.713
Lobster tails.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.715
Champagne.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.385
I have pictures of food
on my wall, not women.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.953
You are Italian.

06:27.955 --> 06:28.955
You have no choice.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.655
No.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.691
You don't miss sex.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.061
You can have sex with yourself.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.498
<i>I miss tenderness.</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:41.400
Hey.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.601
Hey.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.636
Was it horrible?

06:45.139 --> 06:46.538
Yup.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.975
Why is it you get to play?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.243
I'm actually working.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.577
You know that.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.355
Don't hurt yourself.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.357
You're supposed to be

07:05.359 --> 07:07.225
the caretaker,
the warrior, all that,

07:07.227 --> 07:10.295
and I'm...
I'm thatching the hut.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.564
I don't see much of that
going on around here.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.243
<i>What a weird location you picked</i>

07:25.245 --> 07:26.478
<i>for our assignation.</i>

07:26.480 --> 07:28.647
Ten years and no candlelight.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.184
<i>Baby, I do appreciate your coming
to visit me all this time.</i>

07:32.186 --> 07:33.351
I'll make it up to you.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.553
You'll see.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.458
How's the husband?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.896
You're never gonna stay married.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.798
You might be
talking about yourself.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.234
No, honey,
I'm talking about you.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.335
You're into freedom.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.870
Just listen to yourself.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.573
You sound like
a French existentialist,

07:54.575 --> 07:57.042
instead of a marijuana
factory owner.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.977
One minute to go.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.512
Let's go, folks.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.681
I never went back.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.051
He is different.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.153
A nomad, you could say.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.924
But with a creative spark.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.496
An air of passion
beneath the gruff exterior.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.598
Is David like Elma's lover?

08:20.267 --> 08:21.433
In a way.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.802
But Peter doesn't strike
me as a Mahler type.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.870
But no.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.738
They're not direct parallels.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.308
Um, they're all different
from each other, but

08:30.310 --> 08:32.943
integral to her, she needs them.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.645
Okay, tell me more
about the writing.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.719
- Peter.
- What?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.554
Can I read something to you?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.155
Come on, honey, I'm having fun.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.223
Later.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.963
<i>She was like all of us.</i>

08:50.964 --> 08:53.198
<i>Someone who chooses one thing thinking
she should have chosen another.</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
<i>Then maybe she was
right in the first place.</i>

08:56.136 --> 08:57.769
<i>Players, levels.</i>

08:59.106 --> 09:00.572
Thanks, sweetheart.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.039
<i>Isn't that the essence of life?</i>

09:07.114 --> 09:09.814
I've got to get back
to the halfway house.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.284
It's time for the bus.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.785
I know.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.821
I'm so happy you came.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.292
It was a long fucking wait,
I'll tell you that.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.632
I hate to leave you.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.901
It depresses me.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.545
<i>Only now, for the first time,</i>

09:40.547 --> 09:43.181
<i>I can tell this story
in its full context.</i>

09:43.183 --> 09:46.585
<i>But it's by no means what I thought
it was at our first meeting.</i>

09:47.621 --> 09:48.987
<i>I was drawn in.</i>

09:51.625 --> 09:54.559
Hey, what a beautiful day.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.962
I don't know how
the weather will hold.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.863
I think it's gonna rain.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.132
Come on. Let's go.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.637
Why are you hesitating?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.939
I wanted to do some things
this afternoon.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.774
You are always at your office.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.509
The theater world can wait.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.279
No doubt they can wait,
and to infinity it seems.

10:16.984 --> 10:17.984
Do not worry.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.952
Your time will come. Be patient.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.189
In the meantime, consider something...
bizarre.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.423
Like what?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.758
Pleasing me.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.198
Let's do it.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.532
Really?

10:34.534 --> 10:37.202
I don't know what it's about,
but you've inspired me.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.204
Fantastic.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.672
I'm... I'm really glad.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.007
So you have a first draft?

10:42.009 --> 10:42.741
Yes.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.075
This is very important.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.311
You have to trust me.

11:00.394 --> 11:03.561
<i>Her play is about
the composer Gustav Mahler</i>

11:03.563 --> 11:05.263
<i>and his wife, Alma.</i>

11:07.701 --> 11:10.001
<i>Alma was a composer herself.</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:11.903
<i>But when she married Gustav,</i>

11:11.905 --> 11:15.240
<i>he told her there could only
be one composer in the house.</i>

11:15.242 --> 11:19.210
<i>And she made the choice to devote her
life to his music and not her own.</i>

11:20.213 --> 11:22.814
<i>His passion for his work
only grew stronger,</i>

11:22.816 --> 11:25.750
<i>and Alma's desire to be loved</i>

11:25.752 --> 11:27.986
<i>made her stray to an architect,</i>

11:28.722 --> 11:30.288
<i>a man named Gropius.</i>

11:31.425 --> 11:33.692
<i>Gustav loved her,</i>

11:33.694 --> 11:36.294
<i>but he never expected
her to have her own mind.</i>

11:41.968 --> 11:43.268
What are these books?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.937
People trying to break out
of themselves.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.972
I go to my therapist for that.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.574
Well, books are more honest.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.511
They show us how you can't...
You know what.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.813
Um, are you kidding me?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.949
You have equal amounts
of non-fiction and fiction.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.519
Really non-fiction

12:01.521 --> 12:03.722
tells me how to live my life,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.056
and I appreciate it.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.393
And fiction shows me how to

12:08.395 --> 12:10.695
relive my own life more deeply.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.197
All I'm saying is...

12:12.733 --> 12:14.132
this is clever.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.301
It's quick. It's energetic.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.570
But the fact that you refuse
to put in any insight

12:18.572 --> 12:20.572
is really, you think about it,

12:20.574 --> 12:22.173
it's a form of anger.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.909
Guys, I don't think it's always
that deeply psychological.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.010
Okay.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.746
What do you think's going on?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.547
I think some people sing, or...

12:29.549 --> 12:32.784
or they play a musical instrument
for their creative outlet.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.619
But what's rare

12:34.621 --> 12:36.788
is the willingness
or the ability

12:36.790 --> 12:38.356
to put yourself into it.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.325
True.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.359
True.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.294
It could be fear.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.096
Or...

12:45.098 --> 12:46.931
not knowing what to put into it.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.999
Or...

12:48.001 --> 12:49.934
not being able to
go deep enough.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.775
<i>At first my notes to her were
about dialog and character.</i>

12:57.344 --> 12:58.810
<i>But as we moved forward,</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:01.746
<i>I knew that what we needed
was something more.</i>

13:01.748 --> 13:04.115
<i>I kept asking her about Mahler,</i>

13:04.117 --> 13:06.317
<i>but I kept getting
these other stories.</i>

13:16.696 --> 13:18.429
I fixed your lamp wire.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.933
Like you care.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.172
I do care.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.475
Why don't you fix my wire?

13:34.648 --> 13:35.914
All right.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.119
Just don't get any ideas.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.488
Okay? Like you did with
thousands of other women.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.823
And don't hurt me.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.457
I won't.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.828
I promise.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.730
What do you think
we'll have in common

13:52.732 --> 13:55.333
once we've exhausted
the subject of love?

13:57.237 --> 14:00.004
I think we'll find
plenty to talk about.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.807
Like...

14:02.809 --> 14:04.442
what's for dinner.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.079
What's on TV.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.083
Do we have any
water in the house.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.087
We'll find lots of
stuff to talk about.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.040
So I'm the one
who's always angry at you?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.408
You're the one who
doesn't want to deal with

14:37.410 --> 14:39.177
any of the big issues
that we have with this.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.645
How about staying on a budget?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.547
How about getting out of the
shit hole apartment we have?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.915
Or leaving this city?

14:43.917 --> 14:46.484
And when were we
gonna start a family?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.119
I guess I am the one who's always angry at you.
- God!

14:48.121 --> 14:49.187
Yeah, what is the point then?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.922
If you are always angry at me,

14:50.924 --> 14:51.856
what is the point?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.725
I don't know.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.326
Well, I know where
this is going.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.028
I can just see it.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.125
¶

15:45.545 --> 15:46.545
Are you okay?

15:48.682 --> 15:50.248
I can't take this box.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.384
I can't take it.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.086
The old windows don't even work.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.421
I mean, you don't mind it.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.890
I feel like I'm suffocating.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.825
There's no goddamn air in here.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.293
Let's go outside.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.962
Yeah. Well, out there,
you know, it feels like

16:03.964 --> 16:05.863
it's just as small
as this apartment.

16:05.865 --> 16:09.067
There's gotta be some fresh air
by the water outside the city.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.602
Let's just... go.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.637
Come on.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.346
I love the impossible current

16:21.348 --> 16:22.747
of the East River.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.883
We could have gone
there, you know,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.018
not come here.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.619
I was there already.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.055
When?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.357
This morning.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.292
Got up early, walked over there.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.661
Stood there for hours,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.029
smoking cigarettes,

16:38.031 --> 16:40.365
drinking my coffee, studying it.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.205
You need the ocean.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.276
I'm not built for the city.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.711
You are.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.013
You have your writing.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.481
It's not either or.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.982
I love you just as much.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.184
- More.
- But your mind is elsewhere.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.021
I don't want the life
that you want.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.522
Restaurants, plays...

17:05.525 --> 17:06.457
I don't need that.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.791
I want to sail.

17:07.794 --> 17:08.794
Sail...

17:10.030 --> 17:11.963
Haven't you been listening
for the last 18 years?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.131
I'm listening.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.599
I should be here, by the sea.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.285
You should be there.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.969
You want to be pushed
continually.

17:18.972 --> 17:21.906
The city is your lover
because of that.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.574
And you are driven by it.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.078
I don't know if I can
live without you.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.813
You can.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.788
You'll be the love of my life,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.358
but we're not going
to the same place.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.327
¶

18:14.360 --> 18:16.294
¶

18:26.940 --> 18:28.473
Now I get it.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.375
What?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.678
I always thought
you stood over everyone,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.481
but it's just the way
you look down at me.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.136
You're the best.

18:42.137 --> 18:44.521
What? A week ago, you told
me you hate living with me.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.158
That was last week.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.431
¶

19:14.387 --> 19:15.753
¶

19:36.376 --> 19:39.377
You know, it's not normal to
miss your ex-husband so much.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.678
We're not together.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.446
I didn not know
how to live with him.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.415
I mean, I still love him.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.617
You don't really
stop loving someone.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.539
It's funny though.
Now that Peter's gone,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.708
I keep longing
for him constantly.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.476
When I was with him...

20:12.478 --> 20:14.612
I longed for David., you know?

20:14.614 --> 20:18.416
I mean, yeah, Jacqueline. I
think it's just human nature.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.018
The person's irrelevant?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.520
Yeah.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.555
You don't have problems with
the one you're not with.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.190
I don't know.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.992
I mean, tell me the truth.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.327
You never even cheated on Peter?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.429
No, I didn't.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.531
I don't even like
sex with strangers.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.899
I don't!

20:35.635 --> 20:36.667
It's exciting,

20:36.669 --> 20:39.670
but you're never gonna
stop being strangers.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.072
- Yeah.
- You know?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.506
Yeah.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.109
You know, I think people
cheat 'cause they...

20:45.111 --> 20:46.944
they really need
that high, you know...

20:46.946 --> 20:48.913
Like getting paid attention to.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.048
Like they don't get enough
in their marriage anyway.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.283
I don't think that's what it is.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.851
- You don't?
- I don't think that's what it is.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.053
I think an affair is
a sign of having given up.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.855
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.357
Yeah.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.858
Come on, let's skate backwards.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.627
Backwards? Whoo hoo!

21:02.629 --> 21:03.728
Wait.

21:05.198 --> 21:06.364
Finally, I know.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.132
I know how to do that.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.534
- I can't do it.
- Look, look, look.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.238
Ta-da, my lady.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.606
Hey... wait.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.009
I told you I wanted oatmeal
with milk on the side.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.543
And some more hot tea.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.479
That is how you have sex.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.215
- No!
- Ordering your men around.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.017
I do not order my men around.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.452
I mean, you know that's...

21:28.454 --> 21:30.421
not why Dan cheated on me.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.090
Well, the next one...
If there's a next one.

21:33.092 --> 21:36.827
Next time you will teach him
the sweet sensuality of talking.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.897
Me? No way!

21:39.899 --> 21:42.733
You know why people cheat? Because they
don't get to express their feelings.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.070
And you would never
let Dan talk.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.906
You know, you're no panache on
relationships either, you know.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.409
- True.
- I'm just saying.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.977
I'm just saying.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.549
I've got good news for you.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.018
I found money for a workshop.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.387
We're gonna do it ourselves.
We're gonna iron things out.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.588
You'll do another
script revision,

22:04.590 --> 22:06.123
and then we'll go after
the cash.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.591
First performance six weeks.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.627
Okay. Um...

22:11.064 --> 22:14.131
You know, I was nervous that I didn't
know enough about the subject.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.435
Then I realized that nobody
else does either, so...

22:17.437 --> 22:20.705
Anyway, who the fuck in this business
knows what they're doing, right?

22:20.707 --> 22:23.474
Yeah. I mean, why would anyone
who knew what they were doing

22:23.476 --> 22:25.576
go into this business, right?

22:26.846 --> 22:27.712
Only a fool.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.748
We are the lucky fools
apparently.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.784
That must be why so many
artists commit suicide.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.354
Well, if you could wait until
you finish the script notes,

22:36.356 --> 22:39.490
- that would be great.
- I will. I will.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.492
That is funny though. Actually
when you think about it,

22:41.494 --> 22:44.061
how creativity does come
out of pain...

22:44.897 --> 22:46.464
and sexual desire.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.433
I mean, you sort of need both
operating at once, right?

22:51.604 --> 22:53.003
They're a matched set.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.373
Sex and pain.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.741
It's like...

22:57.710 --> 22:58.710
salt and pepper.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.849
I'll have notes in a week,
and we'll go from there.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.954
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.021
Thank you.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.925
Okay, bye.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.125
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.127
I expected you in the evening.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.196
I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.267
My...

23:56.269 --> 23:58.169
flight got delayed.

23:58.171 --> 24:01.539
My phone died and I
couldn't find my recharger.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.107
It must have gotten stolen.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.743
Here, I bought you some tea.

24:08.881 --> 24:09.947
Thank you.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.050
Here are some flowers.

24:15.188 --> 24:16.887
Thanks for letting me
crash again.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.089
How was your trip?

24:20.827 --> 24:23.093
Cuba is wonderful.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.062
When moored with the Italians.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.999
Nobody knows how to eat and drink in
the entire world like the Italians.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.735
So we were taken care of.

24:31.737 --> 24:35.339
Then we got off
and we went into Havana.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.943
The architecture and the colors.

24:40.213 --> 24:43.047
The food, the people, the music.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.782
So great.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.152
Wish you could've seen it.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.363
We sailed over to Florida.

24:59.365 --> 25:01.599
I got off as soon as we docked.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.601
Found the library.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.735
I went to get a newspaper.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.871
I wanted to see how
your novel was received.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.909
I'm... I'm quite
the villain in it.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.279
It's not a real depiction,
you know that.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.851
Can't you make me the hero in
one of your novels just once?

25:21.254 --> 25:22.353
Okay.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.487
I will.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.089
You wanna stay a few days?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.125
I can't.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.161
I have to get back.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.864
How did you end up
writing about Mahler and Freud?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.133
I mean, I know how,
but why did you want to?

26:09.135 --> 26:11.268
Vienna. I mean...

26:11.270 --> 26:13.904
I had a passion for that place.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.907
The mindset of that period
of time, of its geniuses.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.142
And then?

26:18.144 --> 26:19.276
The usual.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.711
What's the usual?

26:20.713 --> 26:23.280
Playing it modern,
finding the right words,

26:23.282 --> 26:26.150
setting, visuals, mood...

26:26.152 --> 26:28.686
Everybody loves that part.

26:28.688 --> 26:31.422
The illusion of power,
your choices.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.489
- Right?
- Have you been?

26:32.491 --> 26:34.191
Yes, twice. Have you?

26:34.193 --> 26:37.361
No. But I've read so much
about it, I feel like I have.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.862
- Yeah?
- Right here.

26:51.344 --> 26:55.379
I was once here with a writer
who had such an ego. God!

26:56.649 --> 26:59.083
Do you get uncomfortable
around that type?

26:59.085 --> 27:00.351
No, I've got an ego.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.188
I think... Are you jealous?

27:04.190 --> 27:07.257
I imagine those people know how to
open the vein better than I do.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.777
Like their...

27:09.778 --> 27:12.296
self-confidence is an added
weapon to their artistic arsenal.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.632
Like love is, really.

27:15.668 --> 27:16.867
Well, this is it.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.636
What do you think?

27:18.638 --> 27:19.970
Yeah.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.639
I mean...

27:21.641 --> 27:23.807
It's more important
what you think, right?

27:23.809 --> 27:25.376
Well, I think it's...

27:25.378 --> 27:27.611
wide enough for
all the characters.

27:27.613 --> 27:30.147
Why are there
so many characters?

27:30.149 --> 27:32.783
Why? Well, I don't know.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.151
I just wrote it. I...

27:35.254 --> 27:37.921
I didn't think
of stage width, or...

27:38.691 --> 27:40.424
cost... I'm sorry.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.992
That's okay.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.861
- We're going. Avante.
- Okay.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.696
I'm gonna talk to
the house manager.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.032
Good.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.988
<i>It became clear to me that Jacqueline
is only giving me what she wants.</i>

28:10.990 --> 28:12.423
<i>Keeping me at a distance.</i>

28:13.359 --> 28:14.892
<i>But she's clever.</i>

28:14.894 --> 28:17.728
<i>She makes it look like I'm the
one keeping her at distance.</i>

28:18.698 --> 28:20.330
<i>This is a chess game.</i>

28:35.147 --> 28:36.380
Hey.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.414
David!

28:39.351 --> 28:40.484
Hey.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.286
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in months.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.587
We've been commuting.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.489
Peter and I, to New York.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.024
Where have you been?

28:47.026 --> 28:49.626
I've been busy, baby, real busy.

28:49.628 --> 28:50.894
A lot of time in Vermont.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.796
I don't wanna know.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.164
No, you don't.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.368
So, how's married life?

29:00.706 --> 29:02.272
- Peter!
- What?

29:02.274 --> 29:03.373
Come on over.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.309
This is David. <i>The</i> David.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.913
<i>The</i> David.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.915
<i>The</i> David. Yes.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.917
You're renowned in our household

29:13.919 --> 29:15.853
for what you did
in Vietnam alone.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.055
Yeah, well...
be glad you missed it.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.424
They say it makes
a man out of you.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.110
Do they?

29:23.111 --> 29:25.094
Well, I think women do that
much more pleasantly.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.498
Yeah, well, I'll agree.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.033
Anyway, it was good to meet you.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.302
I have a very important game
back here.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.504
Later.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.340
You look great.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.226
Yeah, but you can't make
any money now as a writer.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.061
That's not true.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.129
I mean, come on. Some do.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.798
No, the majority don't.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.166
Yeah, but that's
always been true.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.002
Writers... obsessed with money.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.336
That's true. Think about it.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.807
Dostoyevsky, Balzac, many of
the 19th century writers...

30:09.809 --> 30:11.141
all they did was
write about money.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.810
Because nothing reveals...

30:13.512 --> 30:14.478
Excuse me.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.180
The baldness of character...

30:16.182 --> 30:18.115
Nothing reveals the baldness of
character like the grasping for money.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.117
Now 21st century novelists

30:20.119 --> 30:21.585
we're slyer.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.287
We act like we've mastered it.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.856
Yeah, by secretly
wanting to be bought.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.157
It's the times we're in.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.256
<i>What do you think
books are really about?</i>

30:32.064 --> 30:34.531
<i>Longing.</i>

30:38.704 --> 30:41.738
<i>And then the brutal discovery</i>

30:41.740 --> 30:44.908
<i>of what it is
that we really long for.</i>

30:46.545 --> 30:48.245
¶

30:51.283 --> 30:52.283
<i>Love.</i>

30:53.519 --> 30:54.519
<i>Tenderness.</i>

30:56.722 --> 30:57.955
Sexuality.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.356
That's what you give.

31:05.664 --> 31:06.663
What?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.832
"Love, tenderness
and sexuality."

31:08.834 --> 31:10.734
That sounds like
a bad Rod McKuen poem.

31:10.736 --> 31:15.305
It's the sentiments that
are important, not the words.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.275
But if the words are flat, then
that must mean something, too.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.613
Come on.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.450
<i>There's nothing I can't
do with you.</i>

31:26.452 --> 31:27.868
<i>Really?</i>

31:27.869 --> 31:29.285
<i>Like windsurfing in a hurricane.</i>

31:35.527 --> 31:36.727
<i>I'll move in slowly.</i>

31:36.729 --> 31:39.129
<i>A jacket here, a sweater there.</i>

31:39.131 --> 31:40.530
You won't even notice.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.138
Hey, it'll be all right.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.277
What if we fight all the time?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.113
We won't.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.882
Okay.

31:58.884 --> 32:01.585
We'll be the first couple
that never ever fights.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.156
Don't be so scared.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.529
It is amazing.

32:12.531 --> 32:13.764
What is?

32:13.766 --> 32:16.066
So often we don't wait for
the person who gets us.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.668
What we really need.

32:17.670 --> 32:18.602
What do you mean?

32:18.604 --> 32:19.870
I mean exactly that.

32:19.872 --> 32:21.271
We should wait for somebody
who's right for us.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.940
We should be true to that image.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.107
Hold out for it.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.275
They're gonna come
along eventually.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.477
They always do.
That's how it happens.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.982
Anyway, enough about that,
enough about work.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.951
Let's just enjoy the day.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.653
Have you ever noticed

32:36.655 --> 32:38.689
how nobody ever in literature

32:38.691 --> 32:41.258
falls desperately,
hopelessly in love

32:41.260 --> 32:42.526
with a woman in her 50s.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.895
I find a lot of older women
sexually attractive.

32:44.897 --> 32:45.896
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:45.898 --> 32:46.997
What about younger women?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.498
Of course.
But it's the woman, my dear,

32:48.500 --> 32:50.167
not the age that's intriguing.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.481
<i>I thought that Jacqueline
wanted a happy ending.</i>

33:04.483 --> 33:06.917
<i>I had to keep
blocking that instinct.</i>

33:06.919 --> 33:11.088
<i>"The main character doesn't just
get to walk away," I told her.</i>

33:11.090 --> 33:13.523
<i>At that point we only had
two weeks to go.</i>

33:17.262 --> 33:19.329
Sancho, sit. Sit.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.430
Sit.

33:20.666 --> 33:21.932
Good.

33:21.934 --> 33:24.001
Isn't he great?
Better than my ex-husband.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.335
God!

33:25.337 --> 33:27.104
These things drive me nuts.

33:28.874 --> 33:29.906
Hello.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.141
Hey, hi. It's Skene.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.243
Listen, I just wanted to
run something by you.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.345
<i>Sure. How is it coming?</i>

33:35.347 --> 33:37.481
Good. Great.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.616
Be at the theater next week to
look at potential Mahlers with me.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.219
I'm getting some leads on
putting the workshop together.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.388
I think this might happen
sooner rather than later.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.323
Do you wanna help
make it happen?

33:46.325 --> 33:48.892
Yeah, I would... Absolutely.
I would love to.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.928
<i>Come to a casting session here
at Allman Studio next Monday.</i>

33:51.930 --> 33:53.263
At Allman's?

33:53.265 --> 33:54.398
<i>Yeah, it's on the west side.
Do you know it?</i>

33:54.400 --> 33:55.699
Yes.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.601
Okay. Listen, I've been thinking
about what you told me.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.636
Especially about David.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.837
<i>Okay.</i>

34:00.839 --> 34:02.139
<i>What are you asking?</i>

34:02.141 --> 34:03.640
Well, hear me out.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.510
What if...

34:06.278 --> 34:08.411
David finds the notebooks?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

34:11.617 --> 34:12.949
That he knows everything.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.717
Everything you've told me,
he knows.

34:16.455 --> 34:19.289
<i>I don't know. Did I not
give you enough material?</i>

34:19.291 --> 34:21.992
I just think it would help us
understand why you drifted apart

34:21.994 --> 34:23.560
once he saw how much
you missed Peter.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.661
I think it could be good.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.463
<i>Good? Good for who?</i>

34:28.033 --> 34:29.873
For the audience, Jacqueline,
for the audience.

34:30.969 --> 34:33.837
<i>Okay... I will think about it.</i>

34:33.839 --> 34:36.273
Okay. We will see you next week.

34:36.775 --> 34:37.841
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

35:00.032 --> 35:01.565
What do you think of this one?

35:02.301 --> 35:04.334
He's really interesting.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.638
What?

35:09.141 --> 35:11.341
Come... Come on. It's fantastic.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.544
All right.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.014
Hey...

35:18.016 --> 35:20.317
Have you seen that other
drawing that I was doing?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.152
The one that...

35:23.822 --> 35:25.088
You know what?

35:25.090 --> 35:27.824
Could I actually, for once,
have a happy ending?

35:31.096 --> 35:33.797
I'm supposed to be your
happy ending, baby.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.799
Come here.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.772
I'm going to bed.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.185
Here, let me help you.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.159
Do you ever think that you're
so giving in bed as control?

36:02.594 --> 36:03.793
Come on.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.562
I don't mind.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.898
Don't you ever
think about yourself?

36:07.900 --> 36:09.432
Well, I have what I want.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.302
I want you to be happy with me.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.772
You're under too much stress.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.073
Fucking New York.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.909
Just work and make money.

36:18.911 --> 36:21.912
Spend time with all those
insane people like you do.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.914
They're not all insane.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.283
A good many of them are.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.419
I'm actually much better
than I used to be.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.889
It took me years to learn to actually
spend time with people I like.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.893
I will never understand
this David character.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.328
Can we talk about
something else?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.630
David is re-finding his soul.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.732
He's gone to war,
for God's sake.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.935
He went to jail.
It hasn't been easy.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.469
But he's changed.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.205
I created a character like him.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.539
He took a few wrong turns,

36:49.541 --> 36:51.141
but everybody can
redirect themselves.

36:51.143 --> 36:52.442
Okay, look. Can I say something?

36:52.444 --> 36:54.211
Hey, now that you're
not with Peter anymore,

36:54.213 --> 36:56.213
could you please
pick a guy with substance?

36:56.215 --> 36:58.114
Somebody who's got
his shit together?

36:58.116 --> 36:59.316
Peter was a child also.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.084
Who ever meets
a man of substance!

37:01.086 --> 37:03.019
Thanks a lot.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.621
You know what?
I go for stories, not people.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.991
And I really wish that I could
go for someone like you.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.025
Then why don't you?

37:09.027 --> 37:10.427
Stories don't stabilize.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.262
Stories takes scary turns.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.930
Yeah, but the good guys
usually win.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.932
In stories, yes.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.968
In real life? No.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.511
We'll go from page three.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.547
If you wouldn't mind reading
for Alma?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.415
It shouldn't be
too hard for you.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.818
Okay, let's begin.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.156
Almshe...

37:40.158 --> 37:41.992
Your innovative German architect

37:41.994 --> 37:45.395
is as you say, unusually minded.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.831
He has addressed his
love letter to me, not you.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.166
But it is indeed for you,

37:50.168 --> 37:51.835
from Mr. Gropius.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.073
Men are always
in love with you, Alma.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.608
This I've learned to accept.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.745
I suppose it comes
with marrying,

38:01.747 --> 38:04.247
a beautiful woman
much younger than me.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.851
But your being in love
with one of them...

38:08.420 --> 38:09.919
No, no, no, no, no.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.322
Gustav, it was just we talked.

38:12.324 --> 38:15.325
It seems much more
than just talking.

38:16.228 --> 38:18.628
His pen moves along with all the

38:18.630 --> 38:20.397
passion of a French composer.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.799
Gustav, I'm isolated here.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.235
You work all the time.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.436
You hardly notice me.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.406
I would hardly say that
I hardly notice you.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.341
Look.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.742
I brought you these presents.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.912
Are you sure it was Freud
you met in Lighton?

38:35.914 --> 38:37.747
I was wrong.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.116
I was wrong not to
ever give you presents.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.852
And I remember
this piece you wrote.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.087
I made notes for it,

38:44.089 --> 38:46.289
um, to make it better.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.324
Let me show you.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.758
My composition?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.961
I'm sorry, Alma. I...
I should not have.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.999
But I have already thought
of a way to publish it.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.001
You must forgive me.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.970
Let me show you

39:00.972 --> 39:03.940
that I am not the insensitive
man that I have been.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.543
That will be first.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.345
Then we will see.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.948
Everyone cannot change so,
so quickly, Gustav.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.583
Yes, they can, Alma.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.820
They can change.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.576
¶

40:02.367 --> 40:06.669
"I wear perfume and lipstick
as I wait."

40:06.671 --> 40:10.173
<i>David says
he loves to solve problems.</i>

40:10.175 --> 40:12.208
<i>Says it's why he likes me.</i>

40:13.378 --> 40:15.011
<i>But not even he
can solve the problem</i>

40:15.013 --> 40:17.881
<i>of how long it takes
to accept the past.</i>

40:22.888 --> 40:24.454
¶

40:31.596 --> 40:33.263
What are you doing?

40:33.265 --> 40:34.664
I'm just checking out the ocean.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.233
But I was at the sailboat
putting up the new mast.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.169
<i>Does the engine work yet?</i>

40:39.171 --> 40:40.370
Most of the time.

40:40.372 --> 40:41.504
Listen, I gotta hurry up,

40:41.506 --> 40:43.239
'cause I'm going out
for my sauna.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.909
<i>I so admire those
rituals of yours.</i>

40:45.911 --> 40:48.231
<i>Yeah, well, you didn't admire
them when we were together.</i>

40:48.413 --> 40:50.013
Yes, I did.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.081
It was something I could
touch down against.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.919
Hey, I'm gonna be
around town soon.

40:55.921 --> 40:56.921
Could I come visit you?

40:58.023 --> 41:00.056
Sure. You wanna take a sail
when you're up here?

41:01.026 --> 41:02.091
Okay.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.093
Maybe.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.531
How do you handle
the loneliness?

41:08.934 --> 41:10.500
<i>I keep busy.</i>

41:10.502 --> 41:14.270
<i>Well, who did you go to
the movie with last night?</i>

41:14.272 --> 41:15.972
- Alone.
- You're lying.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.007
<i>That's a good answer.</i>

41:18.009 --> 41:20.143
<i>You know, now that
we're separated,</i>

41:20.145 --> 41:22.412
<i>you aren't gonna have to be faithful to
me for the rest of your life, right?</i>

41:22.414 --> 41:23.480
I know.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.148
Listen, I gotta go.

41:25.917 --> 41:26.983
Talk to you later.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.885
¶

42:13.131 --> 42:16.332
<i>Being alone caught me off guard.</i>

42:16.334 --> 42:19.369
<i>After 18 years, it's not
an easy hole to fill.</i>

42:19.371 --> 42:20.603
<i>But you were filling it.</i>

42:20.605 --> 42:22.539
<i>It seems you had all
your pieces in place.</i>

42:22.541 --> 42:24.107
<i>You had your Gropius.</i>

42:24.109 --> 42:25.708
It was a struggle.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.745
¶

43:00.478 --> 43:01.811
Okay.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.080
Maybe.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.183
Maybe I will marry you.

43:08.053 --> 43:11.020
I know you.

43:11.022 --> 43:13.756
You're planning to get away
as you say that.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.661
I wanna grow old with you.

43:19.531 --> 43:21.297
What movie is that from?

43:23.568 --> 43:25.134
We should do stuff.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.805
Do you wanna golf?

43:30.308 --> 43:31.975
- Canoe?
- No!

43:35.080 --> 43:37.146
Say something romantic.

43:39.484 --> 43:40.883
All right.

43:41.186 --> 43:42.186
Well...

43:43.888 --> 43:46.356
We will come in from the beach

43:46.358 --> 43:47.857
when we're 70.

43:49.227 --> 43:50.760
We'll make love,

43:51.930 --> 43:54.664
then I'll hold you like this,

43:56.735 --> 44:00.370
and I'll tell you that
you're the love of my life.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.642
That is pretty good.

44:16.121 --> 44:17.420
I've got an idea.

44:18.657 --> 44:20.023
Let's go for a drive.

44:20.592 --> 44:21.824
I can't.

44:22.894 --> 44:24.761
This is how the pages add up.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.966
David, I can't help it.

44:29.968 --> 44:33.102
I wish I had been born an
investment banker, believe me.

44:33.104 --> 44:36.172
Yeah, well,
judging from your finances,

44:36.908 --> 44:37.908
so do I.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.911
What the fuck?
At least I'm working.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.746
There's nothing wrong
with working.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.682
I don't want to
feel guilty about it.

44:45.684 --> 44:48.117
You know, watching over me
is not a profession.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.486
You don't have to be so
freaking vigilant about me.

44:50.488 --> 44:51.854
You need a job, too.

44:52.490 --> 44:53.723
You'd be much happier.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.761
You sure you're not
talking about yourself?

45:00.365 --> 45:02.131
No, I'm not.

45:15.013 --> 45:16.446
<i>We fought all the time.</i>

45:16.448 --> 45:18.548
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

45:18.550 --> 45:19.949
You know what that's
analogous to?

45:19.951 --> 45:22.852
When I was a little boy
about five years old,

45:22.854 --> 45:25.021
I loved Dr. Seuss'
<i>The Cat in the Hat.</i>

45:25.023 --> 45:27.890
I had an illustrated book.
I loved it so much.

45:27.892 --> 45:29.125
One day I got
a pair of scissors,

45:29.127 --> 45:32.328
I cut out all the
illustrations of the cat

45:32.330 --> 45:35.264
until I realized
that I'd destroyed the book.

45:36.034 --> 45:37.867
The very thing that I'd wanted.

45:42.140 --> 45:45.274
Your theater friends
didn't like me anyway.

45:45.276 --> 45:49.979
I don't like all of them that much myself.
But who cares.

45:49.981 --> 45:51.914
So what are you doing all the
way up here in Gloucester?

45:51.916 --> 45:53.416
Just driving around.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.084
"Just driving around"?

45:55.086 --> 45:57.620
You're four and a half hours north
of New York just driving around?

45:57.622 --> 45:59.188
I'm visiting an old friend.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.757
I see. Okay.

46:03.595 --> 46:04.594
<i>What's the matter?</i>

46:04.596 --> 46:06.529
Peter, I'm sorry.

46:07.232 --> 46:09.932
I really am sorry.

46:12.637 --> 46:13.903
Me, too.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.172
Me, too.

46:19.677 --> 46:21.144
<i>- Bon appetit.</i>
- Thank you.

46:21.146 --> 46:22.912
<i>Merci.</i>

46:22.914 --> 46:24.680
So what are you doing
down there in New York?

46:24.682 --> 46:25.882
What are you writing now?

46:25.884 --> 46:28.017
You know, I'm actually
writing a new play

46:28.019 --> 46:29.886
about Mahler and Freud.

46:29.888 --> 46:30.953
Why are you writing about Freud?

46:30.955 --> 46:32.221
I thought you were Jungian.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.123
Mahler actually went
to see Freud, not Jung.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.792
You know, I have to
stick to some facts.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.593
His wife was cheating on him.

46:37.595 --> 46:38.895
So he went to see Freud.

46:38.897 --> 46:40.797
Occupational hazard of marriage.

46:41.399 --> 46:42.899
Is that so?

46:46.638 --> 46:49.038
May we have some
olive oil as well?

46:49.040 --> 46:50.040
Thank you.

46:50.942 --> 46:52.141
When are you
going back to New York?

46:52.143 --> 46:53.176
Tomorrow.

46:53.711 --> 46:55.044
How are you doing?

47:02.353 --> 47:03.419
Listen to me.

47:04.856 --> 47:07.089
You have some dreams to achieve.

47:08.726 --> 47:11.260
Whatever nonsense
you tell yourself...

47:16.067 --> 47:18.935
No matter what nonsense
you tell yourself,

47:18.937 --> 47:21.037
that's what's important
in your life.

47:22.373 --> 47:23.439
Don't waste it.

47:49.868 --> 47:55.104
You know, I could never stay with a woman if
she didn't have a musical speaking voice.

47:55.106 --> 47:56.606
You know what?
That's interesting,

47:56.608 --> 47:59.475
because I find that people
always listen to female singers

47:59.477 --> 48:00.643
when they really wanna rage.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.545
Rage inside.

48:02.547 --> 48:03.980
Right.

48:03.982 --> 48:06.649
Hey, let's dance.
Come here. Come on.

48:06.651 --> 48:08.017
God!

48:08.019 --> 48:09.552
¶

48:18.663 --> 48:20.363
Shit.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.539
¶

49:04.909 --> 49:08.844
Beethoven knew that
he had to get his music out

49:08.846 --> 49:10.613
no matter what.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.081
Before that he could not die.

49:12.083 --> 49:14.350
Maybe Beethoven just
needed money.

49:14.352 --> 49:17.420
Money and talent have nothing to
do with each other, you know that.

49:18.690 --> 49:19.822
Why are you getting upset?

49:19.824 --> 49:22.858
I just hate how money
messes people up.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.393
I mean, look at yourself.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.963
I mean, you lost
10 years of your life

49:26.965 --> 49:29.465
to the pursuit of money.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.866
I'm trying to
tell you something.

49:30.868 --> 49:33.502
Okay, okay. I get it, I get it.

49:33.504 --> 49:34.971
That reminds me.

49:35.606 --> 49:36.639
What?

49:36.641 --> 49:38.975
Peter. I mean, He always told me

49:38.977 --> 49:40.576
that I would be
way more successful

49:40.578 --> 49:42.478
if I would only stay on his boat

49:42.480 --> 49:46.716
and down more time on my
work on his boat, sailing.

49:46.718 --> 49:48.951
I just... I couldn't do that.

49:48.953 --> 49:52.288
You know, some day you're gonna
have to learn to trust people.

49:53.191 --> 49:54.156
Yeah.

49:54.158 --> 49:56.158
You're gonna have to
learn to accept.

49:56.928 --> 49:58.527
What are you trying to say?

49:58.529 --> 50:03.032
Well, I'm trying to say that
you're too much in your head.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.635
That's what I suspected
you were saying.

50:08.406 --> 50:10.573
Can I have another
martini, please?

50:19.817 --> 50:22.084
I still love it out here though.

50:24.489 --> 50:25.221
Yeah?

50:25.223 --> 50:27.356
It's very beautiful.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.392
When you live out by the ocean,
like you still do,

50:29.394 --> 50:32.962
you just sit here and you
watch the ocean like it's...

50:32.964 --> 50:34.296
your lover's face.

50:34.298 --> 50:36.232
Just like I used to watch you.

50:37.568 --> 50:38.634
I remember.

50:44.375 --> 50:45.375
It's too bad.

50:47.578 --> 50:48.578
Too bad what?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.279
Just too bad.

50:53.751 --> 50:55.317
Write a different ending.

51:11.903 --> 51:13.769
Hey, Sancho!

51:13.771 --> 51:15.671
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

51:15.673 --> 51:16.605
Where are you going?

51:16.607 --> 51:18.274
I'm meeting Skene.

51:19.777 --> 51:21.377
- Really?
- Nothing like that.

51:21.379 --> 51:22.511
Well, then he must be gay.

51:22.513 --> 51:23.479
No, he's not gay.

51:23.481 --> 51:25.014
Just he's not into me that way.

51:25.016 --> 51:26.215
No, no. Wait no.

51:26.217 --> 51:27.216
There's gotta be somebody else.
Come on.

51:27.218 --> 51:28.818
Maybe, maybe. But...

51:28.820 --> 51:30.086
he has a life of his own.

51:30.088 --> 51:32.054
He does not need me
to complete him.

51:32.056 --> 51:35.324
He just is who he is,
and I love it.

51:36.060 --> 51:37.059
Well, let me just remind you.

51:37.061 --> 51:38.794
He is not acting like a lover,

51:38.796 --> 51:40.129
so you better get over it.

51:40.131 --> 51:41.931
You know what?
I'm not talking to you.

51:41.933 --> 51:43.265
- I'll see you later.
- No.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.300
- Maybe so.
- Come on, Sancho.

51:44.302 --> 51:45.801
- Yeah, right.
- Bye, Sancho.

52:11.929 --> 52:13.662
Hey, it's my mail.

52:15.833 --> 52:17.366
Is that from you?

52:19.170 --> 52:21.070
Aren't they funny?

52:21.072 --> 52:22.271
Cute.

52:23.207 --> 52:24.607
I got you a gift.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.308
<i>- Moi?</i>
- Yeah.

52:26.310 --> 52:27.409
Where?

52:28.379 --> 52:29.612
You see...

52:35.686 --> 52:36.686
How!

52:38.523 --> 52:39.655
I love this.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.157
I brought it from Paris.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.395
<i>Merci.</i>

52:52.069 --> 52:53.702
I got it on my shirt.

52:54.539 --> 52:56.172
Ooh!

52:57.275 --> 52:58.908
How clever is this of you.

52:59.510 --> 53:00.676
How did you know?

53:01.479 --> 53:03.646
Because you wear it
all the time.

53:04.048 --> 53:05.214
Hah.

53:06.317 --> 53:08.417
You were fascinated by it.

53:09.187 --> 53:10.953
It's, um...

53:10.955 --> 53:12.321
It's Alchemy.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.490
I think it's witchcraft.

53:19.330 --> 53:21.697
Whoo! Well... You know what?

53:26.771 --> 53:27.736
Time to go.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.004
- Right?
- Okay.

53:29.006 --> 53:30.239
Yeah.

53:31.209 --> 53:33.943
Actually, let's watch a movie.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.211
I never turn my TV on.

53:35.213 --> 53:37.346
I wanna see what's on nowadays.

53:37.648 --> 53:38.714
Okay.

53:42.620 --> 53:43.752
Sorry.

53:46.757 --> 53:50.259
My goodness! This is bad.

53:50.261 --> 53:53.562
I don't know. It makes me feel
better about the stuff that I do.

53:54.498 --> 53:56.498
Besides, there's a lot
of good stuff on TV now.

53:57.635 --> 53:58.601
So they say.

53:58.603 --> 54:01.971
I know. There's just not
a lot on right now.

54:06.711 --> 54:07.843
Cheers.

54:13.217 --> 54:14.450
I'm sorry.

54:17.355 --> 54:20.522
I really... like...

54:22.526 --> 54:23.526
how...

54:24.929 --> 54:26.895
there is no drama

54:26.897 --> 54:27.963
between us.

54:27.965 --> 54:31.000
There is a drama between us.

54:32.637 --> 54:33.702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:34.238 --> 54:35.537
There is.

54:39.977 --> 54:44.280
You do know that we are
spookily compatible, don't you?

54:45.216 --> 54:46.382
Yeah.

54:48.653 --> 54:49.752
I do.

54:50.121 --> 54:51.987
- Really?
- I do.

54:55.092 --> 54:57.059
I like what we've got.

55:28.626 --> 55:31.860
<i>There's still something
that in a way intrigues me.</i>

55:35.633 --> 55:38.534
<i>The characters were all holding
tight to their inner selves,</i>

55:38.536 --> 55:40.369
<i>no matter what the cost.</i>

55:48.479 --> 55:51.613
<i>This, I see, is what she
believes to be love.</i>

55:54.151 --> 55:55.884
<i>I can't blame her.</i>

55:55.886 --> 55:57.586
<i>Things always do change.</i>

55:59.290 --> 56:01.056
<i>Love is mixed up.</i>

56:01.525 --> 56:02.758
¶

56:45.336 --> 56:49.104
<i>I just heard Peter met a
woman at his birthday party.</i>

56:49.106 --> 56:51.206
He was renovating her
shop at the ocean for her.

56:51.208 --> 56:53.976
The kind of thing he
used to do with me.

56:53.978 --> 56:57.279
Yeah, man. You know how long
it took me to get over Dan?

56:57.281 --> 56:59.882
- So many years.
- Great. Thanks.

56:59.884 --> 57:02.718
Listen, is Peter still
calling you all the time? -

57:03.721 --> 57:05.854
But his lady friend
told him not to do so.

57:05.856 --> 57:07.623
Then he called me to
analyze a dream for him,

57:07.625 --> 57:09.658
which is sick, by the way.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.794
She said, "No, you're gonna
have to do that with me now."

57:11.796 --> 57:14.630
Which, I guess, makes sense.

57:15.266 --> 57:16.899
Look, just...

57:16.901 --> 57:19.635
try to remember all the things
that went wrong between you guys.

57:19.637 --> 57:21.003
You know, for one thing,

57:21.005 --> 57:23.739
you guys were completely
incompatible with each other.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.407
Yeah, I know.

57:25.409 --> 57:28.544
We kept getting the scissors
out constantly.

57:28.546 --> 57:30.546
You know we were
together for so long,

57:30.548 --> 57:31.947
so many years, and I just...

57:31.949 --> 57:33.549
I miss him, Annette.

57:33.550 --> 57:35.150
I really... I miss his
home being my home.

57:35.152 --> 57:37.152
I miss looking at him.

57:37.154 --> 57:38.187
I miss...

57:39.023 --> 57:39.988
everything.

57:39.990 --> 57:41.323
I love looking at him.

57:41.325 --> 57:43.058
I just hate
having to get over that.

57:43.828 --> 57:44.793
You know what?

57:44.795 --> 57:45.661
Get a dog.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.262
It solves everything.

57:47.264 --> 57:48.397
Come on.

57:48.399 --> 57:49.465
Look at Sancho and I.

57:49.467 --> 57:50.933
Perfect, isn't it?

57:56.607 --> 57:57.940
Read me something, baby.

57:58.442 --> 57:59.808
I'm not ready yet.

57:59.810 --> 58:02.478
- Aw, come on.
- I'm not ready yet.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.079
God, I'm not
one of those writers

58:04.081 --> 58:06.281
who immediately proffers
themselves to everyone they know.

58:06.283 --> 58:09.718
Their ex-lovers, their cleaners, their
maitre d's and their therapists.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.386
I... That's performance art.

58:11.388 --> 58:13.989
I am not a fucking maitre d'.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.426
Maybe you ought to write
a book about writing.

58:17.428 --> 58:19.061
Maybe then you can
make some money.

58:19.063 --> 58:20.262
What is this anyway?

58:20.264 --> 58:22.264
Actually I never
learned a thing that way.

58:26.537 --> 58:28.270
I learned from my obsessions.

58:28.272 --> 58:29.638
Your obsessions?

58:29.640 --> 58:32.074
You mean these obsessions?

58:32.076 --> 58:33.775
These obsessions here?

58:33.777 --> 58:35.944
These obsessions are gonna
make you end up alone.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.547
You get that? You are
going to end up alone!

58:38.549 --> 58:41.049
Don't you think I know that?

58:41.051 --> 58:42.818
I did not get a choice.

58:43.787 --> 58:47.055
You know, I don't know
what to do with you.

58:47.057 --> 58:48.357
I don't know either.

58:48.359 --> 58:50.526
I mean, all I know
is to keep on going.

58:50.528 --> 58:53.862
I want to, baby.
But I want to do it together.

58:57.067 --> 58:59.201
You know, you don't
know how to bond.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.007
No.

59:05.009 --> 59:06.909
You can't do this.

59:06.911 --> 59:09.444
No, no, no, no.
You can't do this.

59:09.446 --> 59:10.779
Well, I'll tell you something.

59:12.283 --> 59:13.315
Neither can I.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.218
I'm done.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.548
<i>No one was
more surprised than me</i>

59:46.550 --> 59:50.319
<i>that David, too, ended up better off
as a figure of her imagination.</i>

59:53.223 --> 59:56.058
<i>It's too bad. I liked David.</i>

59:56.060 --> 59:58.827
<i>As I told Jacqueline many times,</i>

59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.596
<i>he's been my favorite character.</i>

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:06.301
<i>He'll be back, I bet.</i>

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.704
<i>In a next play or somewhere.</i>

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.809
<i>You know, I can't believe
you did it again.</i>

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:15.277
Can I have a cigarette?

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.712
Yeah, here.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:18.714
You know you deserve one.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.322
He's way better off back home.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.524
It's a jungle out here.
He's had it hard enough.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:32.394
I don't know. Do you think it's
because of that director guy?

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:35.564
Or was it because he read every
single one of your notebooks?

01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:38.433
I just...
I want him to be happy.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.635
I mean, look at Peter.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.703
He was not wanting to change.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.639
Now he has Nikki, and...

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.774
he's much happier than
he ever was with me.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.743
It's all the same.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:50.479
Honey, don't kid yourself.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:54.349
They're gonna go through the exact
same kind of problems that you did.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.051
You think?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.820
Totally.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.227
What is this about?

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:08.130
Seduction.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:12.567
Your life

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:15.837
is about seducing Mahler
away from his work.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.507
Now he loves you.

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:20.442
So it's not an impossibility,

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.878
but he's an exceptionally
driven man.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.082
He desires you.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:30.318
He needs your femininity
in order to create.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.622
He can't live without you.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:35.323
But he knows
that you're younger,

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:38.093
and beautiful,

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.729
and you're faithless.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.133
So he's stuck. What does he do?

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.302
He wants you.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:52.708
He wants your skin,
your eyes, your hair,

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.242
your breasts.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:58.480
He knows he can't trust you.

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:02.484
So he has to accept this need,
he has to accept this love.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.121
He has to accept

01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:08.090
his fear.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.762
The power that you
have over him.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.466
Can you play that?

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:23.739
Let me show you.

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:30.345
Did he visit me yesterday

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.881
as a man does his mother?

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.420
Many say that's the most
erotic of bonds.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:42.390
We no longer sleep together.

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:46.161
The way you know
it's finally over.

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:58.640
Three more weeks of rehearsal.

01:02:58.642 --> 01:02:59.975
We gotta get this right.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.645
How do you not fall in love
with this woman?

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.580
This young woman?

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.883
A lot of directors
fall for their actresses.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.151
It's <i> de rigueur.</i>

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:11.787
You know I'm not looking
for anything, so...

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.121
That's so logical.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.191
Well, logic has been proven
by many fine magicians.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.694
Love has been proven
not to be logical.

01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:21.229
Where is this coming from?

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.864
I don't wanna say something
I'm gonna regret,

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:24.132
so I'm just gonna say this.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.135
I love working with you, I
love being with you, I...

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.737
Okay, forget it. Let's just...

01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:30.272
Let's just stop this
conversation right here,

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.807
'cause it's not
getting us anywhere.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:39.648
Okay.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.049
We just need this
to be a success.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.451
You need it to be a success.
I need it to be a success,

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.687
so I can go on and do
the work that I wanna do.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:48.356
Because right now you're not
doing what you wanna be doing?

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:49.324
That's not what I meant.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.593
Can't we just make this easier?

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.161
I know I will.

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:55.964
Time to go.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.511
Okay, thank you, everybody.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:11.213
Thank you.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:12.347
All right. Bye.

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:15.851
You are wonderful.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.686
Thank you.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.554
It's good to see you.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.923
Thank you.
It's gonna be beautiful.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.391
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:30.498
I have been reading up on Alma.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.335
And this woman makes

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:36.171
Pamela Harriman and Cleopatra sound
like absolute amateur femmes fatales.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:39.507
She is the smart man's
femme fatale.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.509
Kokoshka, Gropius, Klimt...

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.478
Does it remind you of anyone?

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.047
Yeah. No direct parallels.
I remember.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.549
The first day we met.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:48.917
You're the expert, so...

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:51.586
Am I a Mahler or a Gropius?

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.057
- You're in a different realm.
- Okay.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.626
Drama and narrative arts.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:59.127
They involve music and visuals,

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.630
but this is so much more about

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:02.931
interaction.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:04.799
What?

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.035
Is the blues coming to an end?

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.603
What do you mean?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.273
Nothing.

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:13.408
How's your drink?

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.411
It's okay.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:17.646
I'll get you another one.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:23.718
Cheer up.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.954
Things are going well.
You have a play.

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:28.023
People who've seen
bits of it like it.

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:30.358
Who knows...

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.827
What?

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:34.429
I was thinking about the ending.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.431
Maybe we do something
a little different.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:39.935
No, Alma does not get
what she wants.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.103
And over the centuries,

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.339
we've all suffered
that same experience.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:46.107
Really?

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:49.210
It's the hope.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.282
The potential of what can be.

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:01.389
I'll be right back.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:11.533
<i>I was so close.</i>

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.709
<i>At times, I was so confident...</i>

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.180
<i>And then I started
to question that</i>

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:27.983
<i>I may be just a character
in the story.</i>

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:32.620
<i>A piece of her puzzle as</i>

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:35.390
<i>she mines our relationship
looking for inspirations.</i>

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:41.663
<i>You know what is best in music
is not to be found in the notes.</i>

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:44.065
<i>I think I've
heard you mention that before.</i>

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:46.401
Actually, this symphony is

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.570
different from what
I usually write.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.672
I'm not sure why exactly.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.041
It's strange, isn't it,
how people are put off

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:56.311
by art or music that they
think expresses difficulty

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:59.314
when that's the only root
to any emotion with meaning?

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:02.100
Anyway...

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.984
the Viennese are not that comfortable
with the whole concept of emotions,

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:06.087
so why waste our time worrying?

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:08.857
The tenth, the tenth...

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:11.226
- I have to do it, Alma.
- Yes, of course.

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:12.327
Let's put all of us
into your work.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:13.695
That's all that counts,
isn't it?

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:14.963
Alma, calm down.

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:17.365
I have no choice,
and you know that.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:20.835
Of course.

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:21.836
<i>Opening night.</i>

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:23.004
Alma, don't go.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:24.039
You just told me to.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.874
I need to work, but not with you

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.510
turning on me because of it.

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:30.211
<i>What did I miss?</i>

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.014
<i>People may always believe
they know us better than we do</i>

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.150
<i>without looking at what
that really means.</i>

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:36.818
Do you really think

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.353
you can change your future,

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.355
my future,

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:43.858
your life... with a symphony?

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.193
<i>These obsessions here,</i>

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.262
these obsessions are gonna
make you end up alone.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:49.731
You get that? You are
going to end up alone!

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.866
Don't you think I know that?

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.435
And why is that wrong?

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.071
It is all I have

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:59.174
to make sense of any of this.

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:01.843
By all means...

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.246
compose something about it.

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:17.524
<i>Gustav and Alma
become a shadow of the play,</i>

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:19.493
<i>and a memory written
by the critics.</i>

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.367
I'm supposed to be your
happy ending, baby.

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.173
You know what?

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.209
Write a new ending.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:49.224
<i>So Alma goes off
with the director.</i>

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.160
<i>But hadn't Jacqueline
written that idea?</i>

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.328
<i>I was so wrapped up
in my opening night</i>

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.331
<i>that I failed to notice that
neither Peter nor David</i>

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.466
<i>showed up at the theater.</i>

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:03.604
<i>If they existed,</i>

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.406
<i>where are they?</i>

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.509
¶

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.157
<i>There she goes,</i>

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.992
<i>leaving with her own story</i>

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.727
<i>that I will never fully tell.</i>

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.662
¶

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:49.651
<i>I thought that this play was about a
life that happened to Jacqueline.</i>

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.752
<i>Little did I know</i>

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:54.221
<i>it was Jacqueline that
was happening to life.</i>

01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:56.291
