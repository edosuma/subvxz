<i>Richard Cypher,
you are the true Seeker.</i>

00:21.569 --> 00:23.038
See how the deer
changed direction

00:23.106 --> 00:25.076
when he heard us coming.

00:27.446 --> 00:29.748
Can you tell me
which way he went?

00:29.815 --> 00:32.348
I don't see why
I need to learn to hunt.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.950
We're not in
a Mord-Sith temple.

00:34.017 --> 00:35.550
We don't have
slaves to bring us dinner.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.118
I'm here to protect you,
Richard,

00:38.186 --> 00:40.052
not provide meals.

00:42.423 --> 00:44.192
Kahlan's not above
digging up roots.

00:44.261 --> 00:48.229
Even Zedd's been known to do
the washing now and then.

00:48.295 --> 00:50.026
We all need to contribute.

00:57.090 --> 01:00.024
Are you saying I'm not
doing enough for you?

01:03.292 --> 01:05.426
Just tell me which way
the deer went.

01:09.095 --> 01:10.695
That way.

01:10.763 --> 01:12.130
Where the bark has rubbed
off the tree.

01:14.165 --> 01:16.065
See, I knew you'd be
good at this.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.005 --> 01:27.639
Get me a strong one.

01:36.546 --> 01:40.115
There's no need to harm us.

01:41.617 --> 01:43.018
Take that girl too.

01:48.490 --> 01:51.392
Spread out so I can get a better
look at the rest of you.

02:07.575 --> 02:09.710
These men who attacked you,

02:09.776 --> 02:10.943
do you know who they were?

02:12.612 --> 02:13.878
Slave hunters.

02:13.945 --> 02:15.743
And you didn't try
to fight them?

02:15.810 --> 02:18.041
My people are called
the Minders.

02:18.109 --> 02:19.575
We mind the laws
of the Creator,

02:19.643 --> 02:22.277
who teaches us
that every life is sacred.

02:22.344 --> 02:24.378
We love our enemies
as we love ourselves.

02:24.446 --> 02:25.646
Love them?

02:25.714 --> 02:26.813
I'd kill a thousand men

02:26.881 --> 02:29.082
before I'd let one
make me his slave.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.118
Think of all the battles
fought over the centuries,

02:32.185 --> 02:35.353
all the blood spilled,
all the victories won,

02:35.421 --> 02:36.821
and what has it gotten us?

02:36.889 --> 02:39.656
Only more battles,
and more blood.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.891
The Midlands
is a bloody place.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.726
If you don't fight,
even to protect yourselves,

02:43.794 --> 02:44.927
how have you survived?

02:44.995 --> 02:46.828
We're healers.

02:46.896 --> 02:49.097
For thousands of years
people have come to us

02:49.164 --> 02:50.798
with their sick
and injured.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.333
And so we were respected
and left to live in peace.

02:53.401 --> 02:54.868
You're not at peace anymore.

02:54.935 --> 02:56.869
No.

02:56.937 --> 02:59.571
With the passing
of Darken Rahl,

02:59.639 --> 03:02.206
these lands turned
to chaos.

03:02.274 --> 03:03.974
A warlord named Caldor

03:04.042 --> 03:06.776
came across the mountains
and captured our village.

03:06.844 --> 03:09.378
Those of us who escaped
came together in the woods.

03:09.446 --> 03:11.947
- And the slavers?
- Caldor's men.

03:12.015 --> 03:13.615
When they realized
we wouldn't fight,

03:13.683 --> 03:16.450
they came after us, to force
us to serve their master.

03:16.518 --> 03:18.652
Your camp is too vulnerable.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.587
We saw some caves
at the top of that ridge.

03:20.655 --> 03:22.155
You'd be safer there.

03:22.223 --> 03:23.390
We could escort you.

03:25.092 --> 03:26.560
I know
you're trying to help.

03:26.627 --> 03:29.162
But we've always been
all right on our own.

03:29.229 --> 03:31.097
May the Spirits be
with you.

03:35.935 --> 03:38.069
They don't want our help,

03:38.137 --> 03:41.170
and we need to get back
to Kahlan and Zedd.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.473
I don't like leaving
those people by themselves.

03:45.541 --> 03:48.142
They have a right to follow
their own beliefs.

03:48.209 --> 03:49.743
The Seeker
can't save everyone.

03:57.282 --> 03:58.315
That's strange.

03:58.383 --> 03:59.850
It's giving us a new bearing.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.384
Which way
is it pointing?

04:02.787 --> 04:04.187
Back the way we came.

04:04.254 --> 04:06.322
To the Minders' camp.

04:06.390 --> 04:07.890
Seeker, please, don't leave.

04:09.459 --> 04:12.325
Caldor's men will be back.

04:12.393 --> 04:14.627
Teach me how to fight,

04:14.695 --> 04:17.161
so that I may defend
my people.

04:17.228 --> 04:18.862
What about your beliefs?

04:18.930 --> 04:20.396
My mother doesn't speak
for all of us.

04:20.464 --> 04:24.432
Some of us think the old ways
don't make sense anymore.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.034
When Caldor's fighters
attacked our village,

04:27.102 --> 04:29.003
my father stood
in front of them

04:29.070 --> 04:30.937
and he prayed
for their spirits.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.774
But they slit
his throat anyway.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.642
I'm sorry.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.744
I don't want your sympathy.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.679
I want you
to teach me to fight.

04:44.682 --> 04:47.417
I'm not asking you to do
anything you don't choose to do.

04:47.485 --> 04:50.053
But if you want to join Kur
and learn to fight,

04:50.121 --> 04:51.555
we'll stay and teach you.

04:51.623 --> 04:54.458
Kur, fighting is not the way.

04:54.525 --> 04:55.926
We'll go to the caves.

04:55.994 --> 04:57.260
We'll barricade ourselves.

04:57.328 --> 04:59.029
We'll be safe there.

04:59.096 --> 05:00.364
For how long?

05:00.432 --> 05:03.466
Till they starve us,
burn us out.

05:04.902 --> 05:06.569
Who will fight with me?

05:12.609 --> 05:15.944
You'd all rather stick
to the old beliefs,

05:16.012 --> 05:19.280
watch us get cut down
and dragged away

05:19.348 --> 05:21.048
until there's nobody left?

05:35.094 --> 05:37.194
I'll fight.

05:37.262 --> 05:38.996
No, Veta.

05:39.063 --> 05:41.197
You know the Creator's will.

05:41.265 --> 05:43.232
And I also know
I don't want to die.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.834
Or be a slave.

05:45.902 --> 05:47.902
Do you?

06:06.317 --> 06:08.352
You Lot will stay here
with me and Kahlan.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.354
Roga, will you let Zedd and Cara go
with you to the caves,

06:11.422 --> 06:12.789
and protect you

06:12.857 --> 06:15.561
until these people are ready
to protect you themselves?

06:22.403 --> 06:24.103
We need to ask you
something.

06:24.171 --> 06:26.706
Do you know anything
about the Stone of Tears?

06:26.773 --> 06:28.741
Of course we know of it.

06:28.809 --> 06:30.676
It's in our prayers.

06:30.743 --> 06:32.310
Today, the compass we're following

06:32.378 --> 06:35.713
shifted its bearing
to your encampment.

06:35.781 --> 06:37.314
Do you have the Stone?

06:37.382 --> 06:38.649
No.

06:38.716 --> 06:41.418
We thought the Stone
had been lost forever.

06:41.486 --> 06:44.655
For all our sakes,
I hope it hasn't.

06:51.729 --> 06:53.630
Don't we need
better weapons?

06:53.697 --> 06:56.297
Uh, these staves will do
fine for now.

06:56.365 --> 06:59.300
The slavers have swords
and battle-axes,

06:59.368 --> 07:00.968
what can we do with these?

07:03.238 --> 07:04.705
I used to be a trail guide,

07:04.772 --> 07:06.139
on the other side
of the Boundary.

07:06.207 --> 07:08.942
Sometimes there were
bandits in the woods,

07:09.009 --> 07:11.844
and all I had was a staff
to fight them off with.

07:13.814 --> 07:17.082
Nobody I guided through
the woods ever lost a farthing.

07:24.221 --> 07:27.623
One, two, three,
strike.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.061
You have to give it
more than that.

07:33.730 --> 07:36.832
One, two, three, strike.

07:40.972 --> 07:43.406
Better.
But even harder.

07:43.474 --> 07:45.474
You're fighting for the lives
of the people you love.

07:45.542 --> 07:48.710
One, two, three, strike.

08:11.462 --> 08:12.595
Kur?

08:12.663 --> 08:15.063
Kur, answer me.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.231
I knew no good
would come of this.

08:20.598 --> 08:22.532
I'm sorry.

08:23.835 --> 08:25.502
What is it Zedd?

08:25.569 --> 08:28.704
I believe these people
are under a binding spell.

08:28.772 --> 08:32.073
A very ancient
and very powerful magic.

08:33.642 --> 08:35.109
They were fighting
when they collapsed?

08:35.110 --> 08:36.110
Yes.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.344
This is the first time
they've ever raised

08:38.412 --> 08:39.845
a weapon against
an opponent.

08:39.913 --> 08:42.614
That may be what caused
the spell to strike them down.

08:42.682 --> 08:44.849
I don't understand.

08:44.917 --> 08:47.418
The Wizards of long ago
created the binding spells

08:47.486 --> 08:50.655
as a way of reining
in the powerful forces

08:50.722 --> 08:52.356
that burn inside us.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.891
Lust, anger,
envy, violence.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.060
It could be that this spell
was put on the Minders

08:57.127 --> 09:00.896
to prevent them
from raising their weapons.

09:00.964 --> 09:02.598
If the magic is thousands
of years old,

09:02.665 --> 09:04.232
how could it be affecting
these people now?

09:04.300 --> 09:07.868
Some spells don't die with
those on whom they are cast.

09:07.936 --> 09:11.104
They're intended to be passed
down through the blood.

09:11.172 --> 09:13.173
Which may explain your people's
aversion to fighting.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.841
We choose not to fight

09:14.908 --> 09:17.076
because we love
the Creator and her works,

09:17.144 --> 09:18.710
not because of a...
A spell.

09:18.778 --> 09:20.378
Whatever the reason,

09:20.446 --> 09:24.246
I think I can draw
the magic into my own body.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.915
But healing all of them

09:26.982 --> 09:28.516
will drain me
of my powers.

09:28.584 --> 09:30.384
It may take days
for me to recover.

09:30.452 --> 09:32.920
And who knows what
the consequences will be.

09:32.987 --> 09:34.321
What do you mean?

09:34.388 --> 09:36.589
The ancient Wizards
were men of great wisdom.

09:36.657 --> 09:39.226
They did not cast powerful
spells for no reason.

09:40.628 --> 09:42.928
We have no way of knowing
what will happen to them,

09:42.996 --> 09:47.165
or me, if I remove
the binding spell.

09:47.233 --> 09:49.033
We have to risk it.

10:18.395 --> 10:20.362
Thank the Creator.

10:21.864 --> 10:23.231
And the Wizard.

10:23.299 --> 10:26.434
Don't thank me yet.

10:32.773 --> 10:35.174
It's our turn to help you,
Wizard.

10:35.242 --> 10:37.410
I'll take you back
to the caves.

10:40.647 --> 10:41.946
Can we fight again now?

10:42.014 --> 10:43.581
How can you even ask?

10:43.649 --> 10:45.583
You saw the price you paid.

10:45.651 --> 10:47.252
But the spell has been lifted.

10:47.319 --> 10:49.788
Kur, if you fight again
and something happens,

10:49.855 --> 10:52.158
the Wizard won't have
the strength to heal you.

10:57.762 --> 11:01.033
If we don't learn to fight,
we die anyway.

11:03.236 --> 11:05.337
You'll keep teaching us,
won't you?

11:10.443 --> 11:12.110
This is not a game.

11:12.178 --> 11:13.678
Your enemy's not going
to just stand there

11:13.746 --> 11:15.046
while you poke at him.

11:15.114 --> 11:17.549
He's going to try
to kill you.

11:17.616 --> 11:19.783
You have to try
and kill him first.

11:24.688 --> 11:26.588
Hesitate and die.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.495
I brought you dinner.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.498
Quick little bastards,

11:40.565 --> 11:41.965
but not quick enough.

11:42.033 --> 11:43.533
Thank you,
but we never eat

11:43.601 --> 11:44.634
anything that's been killed.

11:46.803 --> 11:49.004
Actually, I found them
by the side of the road,

11:49.071 --> 11:52.406
where they died a natural,
peaceful death.

11:52.474 --> 11:54.140
Cara.
We're Roga's guests.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.842
There's no sense to this.

11:56.909 --> 11:58.877
It's one thing not
to kill another person,

11:58.945 --> 12:00.345
but you have to eat.

12:00.412 --> 12:02.980
I saw some winterberries
growing along the path,

12:03.048 --> 12:05.182
down below the rocks.
We'll gather some.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.225
Go after them.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.326
They don't want our help.

12:17.394 --> 12:18.728
As long as we're with them,

12:18.795 --> 12:20.929
I'm not going to allow
any more of them to be killed.

12:20.997 --> 12:23.064
Go.

12:31.607 --> 12:32.941
Hungry?

12:35.177 --> 12:36.543
Not particularly.

12:36.611 --> 12:38.245
Don't you like winterberries?

12:38.313 --> 12:42.248
Maybe stuffed inside
a crisply roasted suckling pig.

12:44.117 --> 12:45.651
Try one.

12:45.719 --> 12:47.419
You may be surprised.

12:59.463 --> 13:00.729
Good,

13:00.797 --> 13:02.664
right?

13:05.668 --> 13:07.635
Roga!

13:24.254 --> 13:26.789
Take a message to Caldor:

13:26.857 --> 13:28.890
Leave the Minders alone.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.959
I won't let you hurt him.

13:32.361 --> 13:33.727
I'm just gonna teach him
a lesson.

13:33.795 --> 13:34.962
Yes.

13:35.029 --> 13:36.563
The same lesson you've
both been taught

13:36.631 --> 13:39.532
all your lives,
that violence will help you?

13:41.335 --> 13:43.269
Do what you want.

13:43.336 --> 13:44.403
I'm through with you.

13:45.639 --> 13:47.306
Go in peace.

13:47.374 --> 13:51.009
Serve the Creator,
and she will reward you.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.258
Good work.

14:07.326 --> 14:09.159
We'll start again
at first light.

14:13.397 --> 14:15.864
Come on, Seeker.
Draw your sword.

14:15.932 --> 14:18.064
A good soldier knows
when to rest.

14:18.132 --> 14:19.498
Caldor's men aren't resting.

14:19.565 --> 14:21.165
I want to test myself
against a real fighter,

14:21.233 --> 14:23.064
with a real weapon.

14:23.132 --> 14:25.196
You're not scared of me,
are you?

14:31.937 --> 14:34.238
Hesitate and die. That's
what you taught us, right?

14:34.306 --> 14:35.806
You've been paying attention.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.280
Don't go so easy on me.

14:45.148 --> 14:46.514
Nice move.

14:46.582 --> 14:49.016
But know when your opponent
has a better one.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.967
Richard,
what are you doing?

15:12.034 --> 15:14.601
What does it look like?
I'm teaching him to fight.

15:14.668 --> 15:16.135
You almost killed him.

15:16.203 --> 15:18.204
He'll never learn to defend
himself until he's faced

15:18.272 --> 15:19.772
someone who's trying
to hurt him.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.207
Richard, you just started
training him two days ago.

15:22.275 --> 15:24.243
I know what
I'm doing, Kahlan.

15:24.311 --> 15:25.578
Don't get in my way.

15:34.296 --> 15:36.063
Did he hurt the boy?

15:36.131 --> 15:37.830
Mostly just scared
the wits out of him.

15:39.532 --> 15:41.099
But there was an anger
in Richard's eyes

15:41.167 --> 15:42.366
I'd never seen before.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.168
It's bitter, and harsh.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.571
Maybe you're just upset because
Richard raised his voice at you.

15:50.805 --> 15:52.472
You weren't there.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.841
Had you seen what happened,
you'd know something was wrong.

15:57.477 --> 15:58.711
The Sword was glowing.

15:58.778 --> 16:01.046
Glowing?

16:01.114 --> 16:03.248
Does that mean something?

16:03.316 --> 16:06.717
The magic of the Sword
is fueled by the Seeker's anger,

16:06.785 --> 16:09.886
and with it he's able to fight
with the strength of many men.

16:09.954 --> 16:11.955
But the Sword only glows

16:12.022 --> 16:14.190
when the Seeker's anger
turns to rage.

16:14.257 --> 16:16.958
He was out of control.

16:17.026 --> 16:18.393
Could this
have something to do

16:18.460 --> 16:21.394
with removing the binding spell
from the Minders?

16:21.462 --> 16:22.862
I don't know.

16:22.930 --> 16:24.296
But I need to see him.

16:25.665 --> 16:27.899
- You're ready.-
- For what?

16:27.966 --> 16:29.934
I only planned to teach you

16:30.001 --> 16:32.435
how to defend yourselves
against the slavers.

16:32.503 --> 16:35.271
But you're better fighters
than I expected you to be.

16:35.338 --> 16:38.274
We're going to take your
village back from Caldor.

16:40.710 --> 16:42.543
Am I wrong about you?

16:42.611 --> 16:45.114
Are you afraid
to take back what's yours?

16:45.182 --> 16:48.920
No. There's nothing
we want more.

16:48.988 --> 16:52.093
But to fight Caldor,
we need better weapons.

16:52.161 --> 16:53.962
The Wizard can
make them for us.

16:54.030 --> 16:56.230
You won't always have
a Wizard to help you.

16:58.299 --> 16:59.466
We'll get them ourselves.

17:01.001 --> 17:02.668
How?

17:51.145 --> 17:54.347
If it weren't for Kur,
we could all be dead.

17:56.349 --> 17:58.283
Kur didn't hesitate.

17:58.350 --> 18:02.019
He did what had to be done.

18:02.086 --> 18:03.453
Grab a weapon.
It's time to go.

18:13.694 --> 18:16.197
You were raised with
the belief that no man's life

18:16.265 --> 18:18.200
is worth more than another's,

18:18.267 --> 18:21.068
but I tell you today,

18:21.136 --> 18:23.703
the enemies we will face
are not men.

18:23.771 --> 18:27.873
They are the monsters
who held your father

18:27.940 --> 18:31.208
and forced him to watch
while they violated your mother.

18:35.145 --> 18:38.113
They are the demons
who forced hot coal

18:38.180 --> 18:40.581
down your brother's throat.

18:43.885 --> 18:47.587
They are the ghouls
who dragged your sister away

18:47.655 --> 18:50.356
and forced her to live
in slavery,

18:50.424 --> 18:53.391
humiliation and despair.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.227
Don't fight the rage.

18:58.295 --> 19:02.330
Let it hold you in its grip.

19:02.398 --> 19:06.166
Let it guide the deadly
sweep of your sword.

19:15.577 --> 19:18.079
Because it is
the torch of rage...

19:20.316 --> 19:24.287
...that will guide
your way to victory.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.427
This is where he was
training the Minders.

19:36.332 --> 19:38.166
The slavers must
have taken them.

19:38.234 --> 19:39.735
They weren't taken.

19:39.802 --> 19:41.103
Not with Richard
to protect them.

19:42.705 --> 19:44.640
Then where have they gone?

20:17.435 --> 20:19.802
This is for my father.

20:57.332 --> 20:59.100
Follow them into the forest!

20:59.168 --> 21:00.802
Hunt them down!

21:00.869 --> 21:03.371
And kill them all!

21:13.537 --> 21:16.369
Our village has been...

21:16.437 --> 21:18.070
...desecrated.

21:26.810 --> 21:29.878
Creator, forgive those
who did this.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.269
Tamra!

22:00.337 --> 22:02.771
I never thought I'd see you
again in the this world.

22:02.839 --> 22:04.473
Spirits be thanked.

22:05.975 --> 22:09.144
The Spirits have abandoned us.

22:09.211 --> 22:10.378
Never, Tamra.

22:10.446 --> 22:11.779
Never.

22:11.847 --> 22:14.048
She was taken slave
by Caldor's men

22:14.116 --> 22:16.516
when they attacked
our village.

22:16.584 --> 22:18.385
You can't imagine

22:18.453 --> 22:19.953
what I saw.

22:20.021 --> 22:22.121
The killing,

22:22.189 --> 22:23.925
the blood,

22:23.993 --> 22:26.696
And it was Minders doing it.

22:26.764 --> 22:29.099
Veta.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.201
And Kur.

22:31.269 --> 22:34.137
Slashing men to the ground.

22:34.205 --> 22:36.006
My son?

22:36.073 --> 22:38.007
Killing?

22:38.075 --> 22:40.710
Man after man.

22:40.778 --> 22:44.013
His clothes were soaked
with their blood.

22:46.116 --> 22:48.816
It was the Seeker
who led them to do this.

22:48.884 --> 22:50.750
Th isn't Richard.

22:50.818 --> 22:52.885
There's magic
at work here.

22:52.953 --> 22:54.552
Caldor's men
tried to run,

22:54.620 --> 22:58.688
but the Seeker
killed them anyway.

22:58.756 --> 23:00.756
Maybe he thought
he had to.

23:00.824 --> 23:04.590
These men are savages,
slavers and killers.

23:04.658 --> 23:06.858
If Richard let them go,
they may have come back.

23:06.926 --> 23:07.825
Kahlan.

23:14.398 --> 23:16.432
Zedd, what is it?

23:16.499 --> 23:19.467
Inscriptions written
in an ancient Wizard's tongue,

23:19.535 --> 23:21.935
one I learned long ago.

23:22.003 --> 23:23.904
There are more inside
the temple.

23:23.972 --> 23:25.372
We've never known
what they meant.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.541
If they mean
what I think they do,

23:27.609 --> 23:29.342
then there's no telling
what terrible things

23:29.410 --> 23:31.110
Richard may be capable of.

23:31.178 --> 23:33.845
Find him. Bring him back here
as quickly as you can.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.750
Cara, if Richard is
truly out of control,

23:38.818 --> 23:42.087
then maybe only
Mord-Sith magic can stop him

23:42.155 --> 23:44.090
from using the Sword.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.132
Caldor's main camp.

23:57.901 --> 23:59.603
All those tents.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.405
There must be a hundred men.

24:01.472 --> 24:05.107
That's a hundred more souls
for us to send to the Keeper.

24:05.175 --> 24:07.375
How do we fight that many?

24:07.443 --> 24:08.776
We don't.

24:08.844 --> 24:10.911
These are the men
who killed our fathers.

24:10.978 --> 24:12.178
We can't let them live.

24:12.246 --> 24:14.447
We won't.

24:14.515 --> 24:17.116
If we're not gonna
fight them, then how?

24:21.154 --> 24:23.655
We're going to burn them
while they sleep.

24:26.858 --> 24:28.292
Are you all right?

24:31.095 --> 24:34.063
I'm fine.

24:34.131 --> 24:35.264
Richard.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.333
What do you want?

24:40.935 --> 24:43.268
You need to go back
to the village.

24:43.335 --> 24:44.869
All of you.

24:44.936 --> 24:47.337
We're not finished
with Caldor.

24:47.371 --> 24:49.138
More killing only serves
the Keeper

24:49.206 --> 24:51.506
and everything we're
fighting against.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.641
The Minders have
their village back,

24:53.708 --> 24:55.242
you've taught them
to defend themselves.

24:55.310 --> 24:56.677
Isn't that enough?

24:56.745 --> 24:58.279
No. It's not.

24:58.346 --> 25:00.313
Let's move.

25:00.381 --> 25:02.148
Richard.

25:03.519 --> 25:05.688
You're not yourself.

25:05.756 --> 25:07.156
Put down the Sword.

25:09.260 --> 25:12.897
Not until Caldor and every one
of his men are dead.

25:12.964 --> 25:15.834
Now,
you can stand with us,

25:15.902 --> 25:18.772
or you can
fight against us.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.440
I'm not gonna let
you do this.

25:20.508 --> 25:22.041
Richard, no.

25:51.335 --> 25:52.870
Cara.

25:55.073 --> 25:56.640
Cara.

25:56.707 --> 25:58.107
Cara.

25:58.175 --> 25:59.809
Cara!

26:03.612 --> 26:06.014
There's nothing
I can do for her.

26:06.081 --> 26:09.116
I don't have my powers back yet.

26:09.184 --> 26:12.185
You're healers.
You can help her.

26:12.253 --> 26:14.353
Maybe I shouldn't.

26:14.421 --> 26:15.721
What?

26:15.788 --> 26:17.321
Did the Creator
give me the gift

26:17.389 --> 26:19.656
of healing so I could put
a killer back in the fight,

26:19.724 --> 26:21.991
only to kill again?

26:22.059 --> 26:24.660
Isn't that a Mord-Sith's life,
one long killing?

26:24.727 --> 26:26.261
You don't know
anything about Cara.

26:26.328 --> 26:28.695
And if you can save her,
but you let her die,

26:28.763 --> 26:31.197
isn't that the same
as killing her yourself?

26:39.204 --> 26:40.336
Take her to my home.

26:49.279 --> 26:51.380
How could I do it,
Zedd?

26:53.250 --> 26:55.551
How could I raise
the Sword to Kahlan?

26:55.619 --> 26:57.520
Nearly kill Cara?

26:57.588 --> 27:01.457
How could I have slaughtered
all those slavers?

27:03.060 --> 27:05.263
I have something to show you.

27:08.466 --> 27:12.901
These writings tell the story
of a bloodthirsty warlord

27:12.969 --> 27:16.204
who used dark magic to chain
a clan of fierce warriors

27:16.271 --> 27:19.874
to his will
3,000 years ago.

27:19.941 --> 27:21.709
Through the chain flowed

27:21.777 --> 27:25.212
a storm
of bloodlust and rage,

27:25.280 --> 27:28.883
and together the warlord
and his warriors rampaged

27:28.950 --> 27:30.351
through the Midlands,

27:30.418 --> 27:33.153
leaving death
and destruction in their wake.

27:33.221 --> 27:34.788
Who was this warlord fighting?

27:34.856 --> 27:36.656
Anyone and everyone.

27:36.724 --> 27:39.092
He was mad
for blood and power.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.960
Finally,

27:41.028 --> 27:43.663
he was captured
and beheaded,

27:43.731 --> 27:47.433
on the spot where
this temple now stands.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.234
The greatest Wizard
of that time,

27:49.302 --> 27:51.570
fearing that the warlord's
bloodthirsty men

27:51.638 --> 27:54.240
would become chained
to another dark master,

27:54.308 --> 27:57.043
put a binding spell
on them,

27:57.110 --> 28:00.680
that would cause them
and their descendents

28:00.747 --> 28:04.683
to sicken and die if they ever
again raised arms in violence.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.753
Those warriors were
ancestors of the Minders.

28:07.821 --> 28:09.988
And when you removed
the binding spell,

28:10.056 --> 28:11.056
they were free
to fight again.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.226
Yes.

28:15.895 --> 28:18.130
And free to become chained

28:18.197 --> 28:20.665
to another master.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.569
Me.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.742
How?

28:31.810 --> 28:32.977
Why?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.046
Because, Richard,

28:35.113 --> 28:38.315
the madman that first put
the spell on them

28:38.383 --> 28:42.020
was named Canton Rahl.

28:44.623 --> 28:46.257
He was your ancestor.

28:49.536 --> 28:50.803
We start with water,

28:50.871 --> 28:52.238
the foundation of all elements.

28:52.305 --> 28:53.605
That's you.

28:53.673 --> 28:56.275
To the water, we add alum.

28:56.342 --> 28:58.243
That's the Minders.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.748
When I removed
the binding spell,

29:02.816 --> 29:05.517
the Minders became chained
to your will,

29:05.585 --> 29:08.420
but the water stayed calm
as long as you stayed calm.

29:08.487 --> 29:11.122
But then you added the magic

29:11.190 --> 29:14.225
of the Sword of Truth
to the brew,

29:14.293 --> 29:17.161
and that...

29:17.229 --> 29:19.931
...was the vinegar.

29:22.501 --> 29:24.569
Three elements, Richard.

29:24.636 --> 29:27.038
Each of them harmless
on their own,

29:27.106 --> 29:30.074
but together,
a catastrophe.

29:33.645 --> 29:35.446
Because now that
we're chained together

29:35.513 --> 29:38.047
when I feel the rage,
so do the Minders.

29:38.115 --> 29:40.215
Yes.

29:40.283 --> 29:43.018
Then to protect the Minders
we need to break the chain.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.254
Maybe if I got
far away from them.

29:46.322 --> 29:48.289
I don't think
that would work.

29:48.357 --> 29:51.958
The chain seems to be like
a Confessor's magic,

29:52.026 --> 29:55.094
which is broken neither
by time nor distance.

29:55.162 --> 29:57.363
So whenever
I pick up the Sword,

29:57.430 --> 29:58.797
no matter where I am...

29:58.865 --> 30:00.399
Every time you use the Sword,

30:00.467 --> 30:02.601
and lose yourself to your rage,

30:02.669 --> 30:04.269
they will too.

30:04.337 --> 30:06.505
Then I need to learn
to control the Sword again.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.943
I don't know
if it's possible.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.579
The magic of the Sword
may have become too potent.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.382
But I'll do what I can.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.718
It seems so unlikely, Zedd.

30:22.786 --> 30:24.153
Of all the clans
in the Midlands,

30:24.221 --> 30:25.621
I just happen to meet one

30:25.688 --> 30:28.056
that's magically chained
to my bloodline?

30:28.124 --> 30:30.359
Nothing in this world
just happens, Richard.

30:30.426 --> 30:32.694
The compass pointed us
in their direction.

30:32.762 --> 30:33.762
Why?

30:33.829 --> 30:35.163
The compass is supposed to

30:35.230 --> 30:37.765
guide the Seeker's way.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.500
Maybe that means more than just
showing us where to go.

30:40.568 --> 30:43.636
You think there's something
I needed to do here,

30:43.704 --> 30:46.206
- to help me find the Stone.
- Maybe.

30:46.273 --> 30:48.774
Maybe there's something
you needed to learn.

30:48.842 --> 30:51.210
About your ancestry,

30:51.277 --> 30:52.544
about yourself.

30:52.612 --> 30:53.778
Who knows?

30:53.846 --> 30:55.446
Maybe you were brought here

30:55.514 --> 30:57.281
to find an army
to fight with.

30:59.383 --> 31:02.285
Caldor's men, they're
coming.

31:06.355 --> 31:07.655
Always and again,

31:07.723 --> 31:10.358
killing only brings
more killing.

31:10.425 --> 31:11.925
Zedd,
have your powers returned?

31:11.993 --> 31:13.260
Can you fight?

31:13.328 --> 31:16.396
I couldn't incinerate a fly.

31:16.464 --> 31:18.631
Cara's hurt. Zedd can't fight.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.300
It's you and me,

31:21.368 --> 31:23.668
and the Minders we trained,

31:23.736 --> 31:26.537
against dozens of men.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.610
Then you'll need this.

31:34.879 --> 31:36.579
No.

31:36.647 --> 31:38.748
Not after
what I did to Cara.

31:38.815 --> 31:40.549
We don't know
if the Minders can fight

31:40.617 --> 31:43.352
without the Sword's rage
fueling their courage.

31:43.419 --> 31:45.854
Zedd, when I hold that Sword
all I feel is hatred.

31:45.922 --> 31:47.155
What happens
if I use it in battle

31:47.223 --> 31:49.357
and the fury takes
control of me?

31:49.425 --> 31:51.293
I can't trust myself
with it anymore.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.494
Not yet anyway.

31:54.230 --> 31:56.130
Then what do we do?

32:17.051 --> 32:18.585
My mother
and the other Minders

32:18.652 --> 32:20.686
still have the binding spell
on them.

32:21.754 --> 32:24.622
You know they can't fight.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.724
They just have to look
like they can.

32:29.894 --> 32:30.761
Halt.

32:48.876 --> 32:51.811
The Minders want nothing more
than to remain in their village

32:51.878 --> 32:53.212
and live in peace.

32:53.279 --> 32:55.947
But if you force them to fight,

32:56.015 --> 32:57.649
they'll fight to the death.

32:57.717 --> 32:59.851
Your death.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.720
It's your choice.

33:02.788 --> 33:04.288
It's your fault, Seeker.

33:04.356 --> 33:06.824
These people were clever enough
to know not to fight back.

33:06.892 --> 33:08.892
Until you came.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.795
Now we're here
to take blood for blood.

33:11.863 --> 33:15.265
You've already tasted
the wrath of the Minders,

33:15.333 --> 33:17.867
and now you're outnumbered,

33:17.935 --> 33:19.101
four-to-one.

33:30.612 --> 33:32.512
If I do decide
to let you live,

33:32.580 --> 33:34.881
how do I know the moment
we turn our backs,

33:34.949 --> 33:37.384
your peace-loving friends
won't attack us?

33:37.452 --> 33:39.486
I'm the leader
of this clan.

33:39.553 --> 33:41.654
You have my word.

33:41.722 --> 33:44.090
Only a fool trusts his enemy.

33:50.830 --> 33:53.298
I know this woman,
Lord Caldor.

33:53.366 --> 33:54.899
She's telling you the truth.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.801
I would stake my life on that.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.313
I accept your assurances.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.248
But you have my word
that if any of your clan

34:11.315 --> 34:14.685
attack one of my men,
I'll be back with a thousand.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.722
Every one of you will die!

34:49.822 --> 34:52.458
We need to restrain you,
so no one gets hurt

34:52.525 --> 34:54.159
while Richard
and I work with the Sword.

35:00.633 --> 35:02.032
I'm sorry.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.899
I hope you won't
have to stay here for long.

35:03.967 --> 35:05.334
What if the magic's too strong?

35:05.402 --> 35:06.969
What if
you can't control it?

35:07.036 --> 35:08.403
Then I won't use
the Sword again.

35:11.506 --> 35:13.240
How will the Seeker
complete his quest

35:13.308 --> 35:14.374
without
the Sword of Truth?

36:09.324 --> 36:12.325
Let the power of the magic
rise within you.

36:12.393 --> 36:13.660
Don't resist it.

36:13.728 --> 36:15.461
I don't want to lose control.

36:15.529 --> 36:17.963
The rage is part of you,
Richard.

36:18.030 --> 36:20.498
Fighting against it only
makes it stronger.

36:28.104 --> 36:29.572
What do you feel?

36:29.639 --> 36:30.974
Anger.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.909
- At what?
- Everything.

36:32.977 --> 36:35.777
That's no reason.
What are you angry at?

36:35.845 --> 36:37.612
- Darken Rahl.
- You've killed him.

36:37.679 --> 36:39.046
You've used that anger up.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.714
What are you angry at?

36:40.782 --> 36:42.149
The Keeper.

36:42.217 --> 36:44.285
The Keeper didn't
drag you into this fight.

36:44.352 --> 36:45.620
You released him.

36:45.689 --> 36:47.623
What are you angry at?

36:47.691 --> 36:49.659
Losing my father
and brother

36:49.727 --> 36:51.095
and everything
I knew in Hartland.

36:51.163 --> 36:52.866
Everybody has to grow up
and leave home.

36:52.934 --> 36:54.868
That's nothing
for a man to moan about.

36:54.936 --> 36:56.136
What are you angry at?

37:01.642 --> 37:04.544
I can't be
with the woman I love.

37:04.612 --> 37:06.546
Lots of people can't be
with the ones they love.

37:06.614 --> 37:08.314
Some of us have even lost
our children,

37:08.382 --> 37:10.082
and you don't see us
flying into rages.

37:10.150 --> 37:13.051
What are you angry at, boy?

37:13.119 --> 37:14.786
I'm not your boy!

37:14.854 --> 37:17.690
What are you angry at?

37:21.227 --> 37:22.694
Tell me, Richard!

37:22.761 --> 37:24.562
Who dragged you into this fight?

37:24.630 --> 37:27.365
Who are you angry at?

37:31.669 --> 37:34.805
You.

37:34.872 --> 37:37.507
Now we're getting somewhere.

37:37.575 --> 37:38.975
All those years,
you knew who I was,

37:39.043 --> 37:40.577
and you said nothing.

37:40.645 --> 37:43.210
You lied to me
about being my grandfather.

37:43.278 --> 37:45.012
You weren't ready
for the truth.

37:45.079 --> 37:46.847
You took me out of Hartland.

37:46.915 --> 37:48.916
You named me the Seeker.

37:48.984 --> 37:51.718
You're the one who gave me
this damned Sword.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.325
Richard, no.

37:59.393 --> 38:00.960
No!

38:01.027 --> 38:03.461
He has to stop himself.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.957
I almost killed you, Zedd.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.658
But you didn't.

38:38.726 --> 38:40.560
You were stronger
than the rage.

38:45.566 --> 38:47.967
This time.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.102
But you will master it.

38:50.170 --> 38:53.072
As long as you have the courage
to keep working at it.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.278
It's yours, Richard.

38:59.346 --> 39:00.881
And only yours.

39:00.949 --> 39:03.383
If you want it.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.500
Try again.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.068
That's it, Richard.

39:23.971 --> 39:25.404
Good.

39:25.472 --> 39:27.873
Now let it go.

39:37.251 --> 39:38.385
You've done well.

39:49.732 --> 39:51.266
It's pointing due east.

39:51.334 --> 39:54.135
The way we were going before
it sent us back to the Minders.

39:54.203 --> 39:57.238
Maybe I learned
what I needed to.

39:57.306 --> 39:59.676
I think you have.

40:14.019 --> 40:15.919
The hardest people to break
are always the ones

40:15.987 --> 40:19.388
who weren't afraid
to die for their beliefs.

40:19.455 --> 40:21.322
I think you'd be
especially difficult.

40:23.491 --> 40:24.992
Thank you fohelping
save our village.

40:25.059 --> 40:27.860
I hope the Creator isn't
too disappointed in us.

40:27.928 --> 40:30.596
The next time you're
about to use your Agiel,

40:30.663 --> 40:33.732
I hope you'll remember
that we defeated a whole army

40:33.799 --> 40:35.834
without spilling
a raindrop's worth of blood.

40:52.482 --> 40:54.215
What are you thinking?

40:54.283 --> 40:56.184
Just daydreaming, that's all.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.321
You're actually trying
to lie to a Confessor?

41:02.190 --> 41:04.357
When will I learn?

41:04.425 --> 41:07.193
I thought I knew Richard.

41:07.261 --> 41:08.427
I've watched him
his whole life,

41:08.495 --> 41:09.962
and only seen
the good in him.

41:10.030 --> 41:11.163
Until now.

41:11.231 --> 41:13.664
There is only good in him.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.599
It's the magic
that's the trouble.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.100
Oh, if it were
only that simple.

41:17.168 --> 41:20.770
Just a few weeks ago we learned
who his real father was,

41:20.838 --> 41:22.105
a Rahl.

41:22.173 --> 41:23.506
He wasn't raised
by a Rahl.

41:23.574 --> 41:26.476
He was raised by George Cypher.

41:26.544 --> 41:29.245
The Rahl bloodline carries
with it powerful magic.

41:29.313 --> 41:31.414
And that magic
is in Richard.

41:31.481 --> 41:33.482
I wasn't sure until now.

41:33.550 --> 41:37.619
Magic isn't always passed
from one generation to the next.

41:37.687 --> 41:40.422
But the only way he could have
become chained to the Minders

41:40.490 --> 41:42.460
is through the magic
of the House of Rahl.

41:42.528 --> 41:44.529
He's still Richard.

41:44.596 --> 41:45.763
He's still the Seeker.

41:48.065 --> 41:50.400
Kahlan,

41:50.468 --> 41:52.069
there's a part
of the Minders' story

41:52.137 --> 41:54.304
I didn't tell him.

41:54.372 --> 41:55.739
Canton Rahl,

41:55.807 --> 41:57.474
the man who first put
the spell on the Minders,

41:57.541 --> 42:00.176
wasn't always bloodthirsty.

42:00.244 --> 42:02.044
He started out as a protector

42:02.112 --> 42:04.713
and benefactor to his people.

42:04.781 --> 42:06.782
But then
as his powers grew,

42:06.849 --> 42:09.284
he began to fight
and to kill,

42:09.352 --> 42:10.719
and the more he killed,

42:10.787 --> 42:13.489
the more the blood lust
overtook him.

42:13.557 --> 42:14.857
He went mad with it.

42:16.893 --> 42:19.929
And now we know
that darkness is in Richard.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.765
But Richard learned
to control the Sword.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.567
He mastered his rage.

42:24.634 --> 42:26.135
Yes.

42:26.203 --> 42:28.637
He controlled the Sword today.

42:28.705 --> 42:30.206
But what about tomorrow?
