WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:04.613
[Jughead]
Well, it finally happened.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.702
The moment
we've all been waiting for.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.921
A fire in the woods.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.794
Three friends
in their underwear,
covered in blood.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.800
My iconic beanie up in smoke.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.676
Driving back to Riverdale,
they didn't say one word
to each other.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.028
They should have.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.507
They should've gotten
their stories straight.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.386
Mija?

00:39.256 --> 00:40.344
Que paso?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.042
[Hermione] And where
are your clothes?

00:42.738 --> 00:43.739
Oh.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.175
Um...

00:47.525 --> 00:51.094
I got coaxed into
an intense game
of strip poker,

00:51.138 --> 00:53.488
at that stupid
Stonewall Prep party.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.012
Lost my shirt, as they say.

00:56.795 --> 00:57.622
Oh, well.

00:58.841 --> 00:59.885
C'est la vie.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.587
[Mary] Archie?

01:05.630 --> 01:08.329
What are you doing?
It's almost three o'clock
in the morning.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.157
Why are you in your boxers?

01:12.202 --> 01:15.162
Everything's okay, Mom.
I was just at a, uh...

01:15.205 --> 01:17.164
Stonewall party.
We all went skinny-dipping.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.817
Some preppies stole
our clothes as a prank.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.341
Oh.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.430
-What are you doing up?
-I had insomnia.

01:24.606 --> 01:26.608
Are you okay? You look...

01:28.000 --> 01:29.915
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.395
I'm sorry it's so late.
I'm gonna go up to bed.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.236
[Alice] Elizabeth?

01:46.280 --> 01:49.109
You better have a good
explanation for keeping me up
till all hours of the night.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.546
And why are you
in your underwear?

01:51.589 --> 01:53.504
-I...
-Is that blood on your bra?

01:55.027 --> 01:57.160
No! Relax, it's red wine.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.381
Underage drinking
in the middle of the night,
half-naked--

02:00.424 --> 02:02.513
No, I wasn't even drinking.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.907
I... went to
a stupid Stonewall party

02:04.950 --> 02:07.039
that turned out to be
toga-themed.

02:07.083 --> 02:10.782
Bret spilled a whole bottle
of wine all over me,
and I couldn't stand the smell.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.915
Okay, but I don't understand.
Where are your clothes?

02:12.958 --> 02:16.745
I put them in a sink
to soak off,

02:16.788 --> 02:18.181
and when I was leaving,
I couldn't find them.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.965
Okay, that makes no sense.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.707
So, Jughead couldn't just
lend you one of his
grungy flannels?

02:25.580 --> 02:28.887
I'm tired, I need to wash up,
and go to bed, okay?

02:28.931 --> 02:30.150
-What--
-I'm sorry.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.151
Betty?

02:37.983 --> 02:38.984
[breathing heavily]

02:44.816 --> 02:45.861
[whimpers]

02:45.904 --> 02:46.905
[muttering]

02:50.213 --> 02:51.171
[breathing heavily]

02:55.218 --> 02:57.089
[Jughead] That's the thing
about murder.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.700
You've gotta have
the stomach for it.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.399
[Betty vomiting]

03:02.443 --> 03:05.185
Especially if all signs point
to you having committed it.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.143
[vomiting continues]

03:07.187 --> 03:10.494
Toga party, strip poker,
and skinny-dipping.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.801
Those are three
wildly different activities.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.413
If our parents compare notes,
we could be
in deep, deep trouble.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.242
I panicked, Betty.
I blurted out the first thing
that came to mind.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.853
-Me too.
-Me, three, but this is
exactly the kind of mistake

03:21.897 --> 03:24.247
we can't afford to make.
Charles made that
abundantly clear.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.686
I keep thinking

03:28.730 --> 03:29.905
we should've called someone
other than Charles.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.646
No, Charles was
the right call to make.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.257
-He's had experience
dealing with--
-[Veronica] Bodies.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.521
-Dead bodies.
-As a matter of fact, yeah.
He's an expert.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.262
Without him, we would
all be in jail right now.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.351
For what? We didn't
do anything, did we?

03:43.005 --> 03:44.180
Did we, Betty?

03:46.791 --> 03:48.315
When Archie and I
found you and Jughead--

03:48.358 --> 03:49.794
I had just
found Jughead, too.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.361
You were holding the rock.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.451
Yes, I... I picked up the rock.
That was a stupid mistake.

03:54.495 --> 03:57.019
I played right into their trap.

03:57.062 --> 04:00.022
Those psychotic preppies
are trying to frame us
for murder.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.676
Why us? They barely know us.

04:01.719 --> 04:05.201
Me, then.
They're trying to frame me
for Jughead's murder.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.029
That has to
have been their plan.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.987
They wanted me
to be caught, red-handed,

04:09.031 --> 04:13.427
standing over Jughead's body,
with my DNA smeared
all over everything.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.732
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

04:18.822 --> 04:19.868
Okay...

04:21.303 --> 04:24.133
Okay, we have to be
smart about this.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.701
We have to take them down.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.399
We cannot let them
get away with this,
with what they've done.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.445
Betty, why would they
want to murder Jughead?

04:31.488 --> 04:34.665
Maybe Jughead got closer
to the truth about Chipping's
death than they liked,

04:34.709 --> 04:35.927
or maybe...

04:37.581 --> 04:38.626
Maybe what?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.628
Maybe this is just
a game to them.

04:40.671 --> 04:45.154
This whole thing is a game
or an experiment to commit
the perfect murder.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.677
If it's a game,
then it's a sick one.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.245
Hey, guys. What's up?
Can I join you?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.378
Actually, Kev, we're kind of
in the middle of something
right now. Catch you later?

04:52.770 --> 04:55.338
Uh, yeah. Of course.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.036
Archie, that was exactly
the wrong thing to do.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.039
We have to pretend
to be normal.
Everything is normal.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.999
Kev. Come back.
Archie's just kidding.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.916
-Right, Arch?
-Yeah. Sorry, Kev. My bad.

05:07.959 --> 05:08.873
All good.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.964
What are you guys
talking about?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.357
-Seems intense.
-No.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.532
Mmm-mmm.
Nope. Nothing.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.142
How's everything going
with the musical?

05:17.186 --> 05:18.318
Have you decided
what you're doing?

05:19.144 --> 05:20.058
[Kevin] Yeah.

05:26.848 --> 05:29.111
Oh, good.
Archie, you're home.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.418
Remember my friend
from Sarah Florence,
Brooke Rivers?

05:31.461 --> 05:33.811
And from
the Naval Academy, right?

05:33.855 --> 05:36.510
-Nice to see you again,
Counselor Rivers.
-Yeah.

05:36.553 --> 05:40.165
So, Brooke was just
in town for a visit,
and we were catching up,

05:40.209 --> 05:42.124
and of course, I told her
about your situation.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.040
What situation?

05:45.083 --> 05:48.043
Oh, with school and colleges.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.871
And she thought--
Well, we thought,

05:49.914 --> 05:51.742
that we might have an idea.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.136
Archie, I was talking
with your mom,

05:54.179 --> 05:57.748
and I was telling her
how impressed I was with you
when we met last year.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.142
Really? Even though
I passed out
and fell flat on my face

06:00.185 --> 06:02.187
before the exhibition match?

06:02.231 --> 06:04.668
People can be taught
to know their limits.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.541
They can't be taught
gumption and fortitude.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.760
That's what I see in you.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.763
That's why I'd be willing to
recommend you to the Commandant
for the Naval Academy.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.070
If you're interested.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.463
The Naval Academy?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.943
It's a long shot,
but it could be a path forward.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.641
Assuming you'd want it, Archie.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.208
Sure, Mom.
Yeah, that sounds great.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.993
Thank you, Counselor Rivers.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
Would you like to join us?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.826
Uh, I think I'm gonna go
for a run, actually.

06:31.869 --> 06:32.870
Thanks again.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
[Mary breathes deeply]

06:44.404 --> 06:45.448
Hermanita.

06:46.710 --> 06:47.755
You're just in time.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.671
No offense, Hermosa,

06:50.714 --> 06:53.282
but I am not in the mood
to pretend like I can
stomach your antics.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.982
Veronica... honey,
why don't you take a seat.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.723
We've got something
important to discuss.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.423
Okay.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.649
Mija,I've decided
to update my will.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.043
Your will?

07:17.175 --> 07:18.263
And, let me guess...

07:18.960 --> 07:20.831
this was Hermosa's idea?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.659
Me?

07:22.703 --> 07:24.748
And why would you think that?

07:24.792 --> 07:27.621
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because you always seem
to show up when it suits you.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.623
And you're so much better?

07:29.666 --> 07:33.191
Changing your name,
deliberately undermining
Papi'srum business.

07:33.235 --> 07:36.020
As usual, you have no idea
what the hell
you're talking about,

07:36.064 --> 07:38.414
so why don't you sink back
to whatever Florida swamp
you crawled--

07:38.458 --> 07:39.850
Basta!Enough.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.766
I'm the one who wanted this.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.725
As a precaution.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.509
Just in case.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.252
It's a normal thing.
People do this.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.036
[exhales deeply]

07:53.385 --> 07:54.386
"Normal"?

08:00.001 --> 08:02.046
Are we really going to
play this game?

08:02.090 --> 08:05.049
Are you seriously going to
pretend like this is normal?

08:05.093 --> 08:07.269
-Veronica--
-No, Mom, I'm sorry.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.620
But I can't take this.
There's only so much
pretending I can do.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.318
[exhales]

08:14.798 --> 08:17.018
You really want me to
sign off on your will, Daddy?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.152
Don't you think you should've
been honest with me first?

08:22.763 --> 08:25.766
About what everyone
in this room
knows is happening,

08:25.809 --> 08:28.333
even if they're too scared
to talk about it?

08:29.639 --> 08:30.640
[scoffs]

08:33.861 --> 08:36.254
There. That's what I think
about your will.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.611
[exhales sharply]

08:44.654 --> 08:45.960
[dialing]

08:46.003 --> 08:47.352
[line ringing]

08:49.964 --> 08:51.618
Mr. Jones? Hey, it's Betty.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.054
Um, I'm sorry to bother you,

08:53.097 --> 08:55.317
but I haven't heard from Jug
all morning,

08:55.360 --> 08:56.623
and I'm starting to get
a little worried.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.667
Have you talked to him?

08:59.974 --> 09:01.541
Just at the party last night.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.025
The only thing I can think of
is that he went somewhere
to write.

09:08.069 --> 09:11.594
I know he had to finish
a draft of his novel.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.510
No. You know what,
I can go to Stonewall Prep
and see if he's there.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.730
I have to pick up some stuff
I left in his room anyway.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.908
Thanks, Mr. Jones.
I'll do the same.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.387
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.480
How was that?

09:28.524 --> 09:30.613
Very convincing.

09:30.657 --> 09:34.182
You did exactly what you'd do
if you hadn't heard from
Jughead for a few hours.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.706
[breathes deeply]
Are you ready to go
into the lion's den?

09:37.446 --> 09:38.447
I think so.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.101
Okay.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.190
In any case, here's the bug.

09:43.757 --> 09:46.629
And remember,
besides planting it,
our goal is to--

09:46.673 --> 09:48.675
Find out what they know,

09:48.718 --> 09:52.200
what they think happened,
and what they thought
was going to happen.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.681
-[knocking at door]
-[Bret speaking indistinctly]

09:54.724 --> 09:57.248
Oh! Hey, Ponytail, what's up?

09:57.292 --> 10:00.034
Hi. I haven't heard
from Jughead today.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.645
-I wanted to know
if you guys had seen him.
-No, not since the party.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.082
Not since the two of you
walked off into
the woods together.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.389
We didn't do that.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.696
You and I went into
the woods together, Donna.

10:09.739 --> 10:10.610
Did we?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.264
All I remember is,

10:13.308 --> 10:17.355
you met up with Jughead
and peeled off together,
hand in hand.

10:18.008 --> 10:21.055
That didn't happen.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.404
It did.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.406
-Hmm.
-Maybe you don't
remember because...

10:25.363 --> 10:26.974
you were pretty drunk.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.497
I'm surprised
you didn't black out.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.281
Or did you black out?

10:32.457 --> 10:36.287
No. I was fully conscious
the entire time.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.289
Are you sure about that?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.248
Because your friend
Evelyn Evernever

10:40.291 --> 10:43.860
said you have a history
of blacking out...

10:45.993 --> 10:47.647
and doing terrible things.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.260
Bret, how about you?

10:52.303 --> 10:54.915
Did you and Jug have
any interesting chats
at the party?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.307
Oh, no, not really.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.266
Forsythe was in a mood,
more than usual.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.789
He had a bunny mask on.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.270
Last thing I remember...

11:02.313 --> 11:04.402
was him saying that
he was gonna meet up
with you in the woods,

11:04.446 --> 11:06.274
which, I assume, happened.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.754
It didn't.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.844
He did say he wanted
to talk to you,though.

11:10.887 --> 11:14.412
So, Betty, are you saying
you and Jughead didn't
meet up in the woods?

11:14.456 --> 11:16.414
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.765
I'm saying you and I
went into the woods together.

11:18.808 --> 11:19.853
And then what happened?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.468
Don't you remember?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.775
If you're that worried
about Jughead, maybe
you should call the police.

11:28.818 --> 11:33.344
Oh, I already told his father,
the Sheriff. So he's aware.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.782
-Interesting.
-Shut up, Bret.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.436
Well, I'm sure he'll turn up.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.003
But let us know
if you hear anything.

11:40.612 --> 11:41.439
Will do.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.141
Oh, and, Betty...

11:47.184 --> 11:50.971
let us know if you remember
whatever happened
when you blacked out.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.675
Watch where you're going.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.242
Yeah, back at ya.

12:06.073 --> 12:10.555
My dad made out a will,
and he still refuses
to admit that he's sick.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.691
My mom wants to
ship me off to the Navy.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.433
-What?
-And I don't even care, Ronnie.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.130
-All I can think about is--
-I know.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.958
Betty.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.395
-[sighs]
-[sighs] Me too.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.443
That's kind of why
I texted you, Archie.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.924
Why was Betty
holding the rock?

12:32.012 --> 12:34.797
-Because she picked it up.
-Why?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.844
Why would she do that?
She knows about
fingerprints and DNA.

12:37.887 --> 12:38.888
What do you think happened?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.412
I don't know. Maybe...

12:42.152 --> 12:43.806
she had an episode.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.852
[sighs] Ronnie, come on.

12:45.895 --> 12:50.247
Archie, you didn't see her
sophomore year with
Chuck Clayton in the hot tub.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.553
She went full Sybil.

12:51.596 --> 12:54.034
She thought she was Polly
and Chuck was Jason,

12:54.077 --> 12:56.079
and, I swear,
for a minute there...

12:57.167 --> 12:58.908
I thought she was
going to drown him.

12:58.952 --> 13:02.956
It was terrifying.
And even more terrifying
was that the next day,

13:02.999 --> 13:05.480
she didn't even remember it.
It was like she blacked out.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.830
That was Chuck Clayton,
this is Jughead. She...
She would never.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.266
What if she didn't know
she was doing it?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.269
We saw her, Archie.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.054
With the rock...

13:14.924 --> 13:16.273
covered in blood.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.238
Hello, Evelyn.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.109
It's nice to
see you again, Betty.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.765
So, tell me, what can I
do for you this time?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.777
Did a girl named Donna Sweett
come and visit you,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.518
from Stonewall Prep?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.346
She did.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.435
She asked me about
your time at the Farm.

13:50.481 --> 13:54.572
Donna said you told her about
some post-hypnotic suggestion

13:54.616 --> 13:56.357
that I would be susceptible to.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.662
What, like some...

13:58.533 --> 14:00.317
magic word...

14:00.361 --> 14:02.929
that would cause you to fugue
in such an extreme way

14:02.972 --> 14:06.193
that you could hurt someone
you love and not remember it?

14:08.238 --> 14:09.239
I mean...

14:10.719 --> 14:12.068
I guess it's possible.

14:14.984 --> 14:18.074
But what specifically
is bothering you, Betty?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.598
I can tell something is.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.875
I went to a party last night.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.793
And I think I blacked out.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.974
-And I wanna know--
-What you're capable of.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.279
Right?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.587
Come on, Betty.
You already know.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.851
And, besides,

14:55.895 --> 14:58.593
I actually have
a question for you.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.988
How's Jughead doing
these days?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.778
Go to hell, Evelyn.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.476
Oh, I'm already in hell, Betty.

15:13.564 --> 15:16.350
This is hell.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.569
And soon you're gonna
be here, too,

15:18.613 --> 15:22.356
'cause they're saving a cell
for you on murderers' row
down the hall from Old Sparky,

15:22.399 --> 15:24.488
where they keep
all the boyfriend killers.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.333
Hey, where'd you go
after Stonewall?

15:44.987 --> 15:48.382
Um, just made a pit stop
at Pop's.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.819
You okay?

15:50.862 --> 15:53.735
Yeah, I'm fine. Have you
heard anything interesting?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.564
No. Nothing.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.523
Bret's just been monologuing
about his new Rolex
for the last 30 minutes.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.396
Okay, we need to do something
that rattles them.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.007
That forces them
to make a mistake,

16:05.051 --> 16:06.226
or to say something...

16:07.618 --> 16:08.750
incriminating.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.014
[panting]

16:15.409 --> 16:17.846
-Hey, how was your run?
-Yeah, it was good.

16:19.282 --> 16:23.243
Listen, I'm sorry
if I just sprang that on you.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.592
What, the Naval Academy?

16:25.549 --> 16:27.508
It's fine, Mom.

16:27.551 --> 16:32.426
Good. Um, because
there's something else that
I need to talk to you about.

16:34.167 --> 16:34.994
What's up?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.606
Brooke's not just my friend.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.434
She's...

16:41.130 --> 16:42.827
my girlfriend.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.787
-Your what?
-We hadn't really been
close since college.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.530
And then we reconnected
after her husband died
in Afghanistan,

16:49.573 --> 16:51.575
which was really hard on her.

16:51.619 --> 16:55.797
And at first, I just thought
I was comforting her,
and then...

16:55.840 --> 16:58.495
I don't know...
[chuckles nervously]
It just happened.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.672
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us, Archie.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.370
I hope you're okay with it.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.849
-Are you?
-Yeah, Mom.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.027
-I mean, I'm not gonna lie,
I'm a little surprised--
-[knock at door]

17:09.550 --> 17:11.073
Oh, hi.
Hey, Mrs. Andrews.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.555
Archie, do you
have a second?

17:14.598 --> 17:15.817
Yeah, totally.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.253
-We'll talk more
later, Mom? Cool?
-Yeah.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.516
[Betty] Nice to see you.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.435
[Betty] I need your help
with something.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.656
Of course. Anything, Betty.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.572
I need you to go to Stonewall
and start a fight with Bret.

17:31.615 --> 17:35.271
What? I thought we were
supposed to be laying low,
acting normal.

17:35.315 --> 17:39.145
We are. Going to Stonewall Prep
is exactly what
Archie Andrews would do

17:39.188 --> 17:41.147
in retaliation for what
they did to Jughead.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.670
What would it
even accomplish?

17:42.713 --> 17:45.673
Besides revenge for Jughead,
it would get them talking.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.110
We know it was them.
We just need proof.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.286
Do we know it was them?

17:50.330 --> 17:51.983
I mean, we didn't see them.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.377
Of course it was them.
Who else would it have been?

17:59.861 --> 18:00.688
Bret!

18:02.777 --> 18:03.778
Oh, crap.

18:08.522 --> 18:09.653
What did you do to Jughead?

18:09.697 --> 18:12.047
Nothing, you plebe.
Now, get away--

18:13.222 --> 18:14.093
[grunts]

18:15.050 --> 18:17.444
The hell you didn't.
Admit it!

18:17.487 --> 18:20.534
You killed Jughead.
You killed my best friend.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.972
[Donna] Archie, you're done!

18:24.015 --> 18:26.192
I called campus security.
They're on their way.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.803
I suggest you go,
or the police will be next.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.763
Don't kid yourself, Elmo.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.417
You and I both know
who killed Jughead.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.639
It was Betty. Don't let her
drag you down with her.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.086
-[door slamming]
-[Donna] What the hell
was that about, Bret?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.697
[Bret] That red-headed lout
accosted me out of nowhere.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.004
Wanted me to confess
to offing Forsythe.

18:56.047 --> 19:00.487
The irony being, of course,
that we know
who Forsythe's murderer is.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.446
Ponytail herself.

19:05.622 --> 19:09.757
Betty, Betty, Betty,
how stupid do you think
we are?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.412
[Donna] Planting bugs
like a rank amateur?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.849
Sending a bull
into a china shop.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.025
You're gonna seriously
have to up your game

19:17.068 --> 19:19.506
if this is gonna be
any fun for us.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.684
-Bye for now.
-[static screeching]

19:23.727 --> 19:25.816
[grunts in frustration]
They are so infuriating!

19:25.860 --> 19:27.818
It's okay. They're smart.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.299
We just have to be smarter.

19:36.740 --> 19:37.567
Archie?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.788
Archie.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.747
I just got off the phone
with the headmaster
at Stonewall Prep.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.446
He said that there was
an incident at the dorm.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.752
Apparently, you attacked
a student?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.885
It was that douchebag Bret.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.366
-He had it coming to him.
-Archie, what is
going on with you?

19:54.497 --> 19:56.151
Are you upset with me?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.109
-About Brooke?
-What? No.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.590
-No, Mom, of course not.
-Well, then can you
tell me what's wrong?

20:01.678 --> 20:02.940
It's incredibly complicated.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.291
I know I'm not your father.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.945
But you can tell me
what is happening in your life.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
You just need to trust me.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.298
Let me in, and I will help you.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.781
-Mom--
-[cell phone ringing]

20:22.482 --> 20:24.440
-[sighs]
-Hello?

20:24.484 --> 20:26.268
[Betty] Stop talking, Archie.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.270
Don't say another word.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.446
Tell your mom that
everything's fine,

20:30.490 --> 20:32.579
but that you have to go.

20:32.622 --> 20:35.016
Say it's about Veronica.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.845
Just end the conversation
before you say
something stupid.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.803
Do it. Now.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.809
I understand, Veronica.
I'll be right over.

20:47.550 --> 20:50.118
-That was Veronica.
Look, I have to--
-You have to go.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.728
You always have to go.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.034
You're avoiding me, Archie.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.863
I'm sorry, Mom, it's just...

20:55.906 --> 20:58.779
[sighs] Ronnie asked me
not to say anything,
but her dad is sick.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.128
Like, really, really sick.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.173
Oh, my God. With what?

21:02.217 --> 21:04.698
It's some muscular thing.
I'm not sure exactly.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.396
Ronnie's really upset,
so I haven't asked her
too many questions.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.182
But that's no excuse
to disrespect you.
I'm so sorry.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.272
-I'll make it up to you,
I promise.
-[sighs]

21:18.233 --> 21:21.541
Elizabeth, can you
come here for a moment?

21:22.150 --> 21:23.282
What's going on?

21:28.765 --> 21:31.072
I got to admit,
it was Jellybean's idea.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.814
We've been calling Jug's phone.
Of course, no answer.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.206
It's been going
straight to voicemail.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.905
But then Jellybean said that...

21:37.948 --> 21:41.082
That we should try to track it.
That there's a way to, uh...

21:41.125 --> 21:43.389
To ping a lost phone,
so we did that.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.871
And sure enough,
it started to... To ping.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.700
Where was it?

21:55.270 --> 21:56.140
In your jacket.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.276
So I guess
I'm wondering, Betty...

22:01.320 --> 22:03.800
what the hell are you doing
with my missing son's phone?

22:11.765 --> 22:13.506
Well, Elizabeth?

22:13.549 --> 22:14.768
Explain yourself.

22:15.682 --> 22:18.598
Okay. Uh...

22:18.641 --> 22:23.603
The night of the party,
Jughead was talking about
losing his phone.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.127
He thought he had lost it
in the woods,

22:26.170 --> 22:30.218
but I reminded him
that he had just left it here
to charge before the party.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.961
It was dead,
so we plugged it in
to charge it.

22:34.004 --> 22:37.225
And when we left for the party,
we must've forgot about it.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.619
-Forgot about it?
All this time?
-[Alice] Okay.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.403
-Yeah.
-How did it get
into your jacket?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.840
I must've picked it up
at some point.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.799
"At some point"?

22:45.842 --> 22:49.193
Elizabeth, Jughead is missing,
you have his phone.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.804
You didn't think it was
worth mentioning to anyone?

22:50.847 --> 22:53.459
I don't know
what to tell you, Mom.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.286
I'm worried, okay?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.724
This is the longest
Jughead and I have
ever gone without talking,

22:57.767 --> 22:59.813
even when
we've been in a fight.

22:59.856 --> 23:03.077
So, please forgive me
if I'm not 100% lucid
about this.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.471
[exhales deeply]

23:08.474 --> 23:11.999
I think we should
declare Jughead
a missing person, Mr. Jones.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.130
Can you do that?

23:16.264 --> 23:17.526
I'm losing my mind here.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.662
[Veronica] So that's where
Jughead's phone was?

23:22.705 --> 23:26.143
The preppies must have
snuck it into my pocket
when I was at Stonewall.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.015
-To make you look guilty?
-Exactly.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.278
You know what?
Joan bumped into me
as I was leaving.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.934
That's probably
when it happened.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.719
God! This...
This was a move, okay?

23:36.763 --> 23:38.634
Just like everything else
that they do.

23:38.678 --> 23:42.116
They are treating this
like a game of Chicken,
and they're enjoying it.

23:42.159 --> 23:45.075
But I am not about to blink.
Are you?

23:49.906 --> 23:50.907
[door opening]

23:52.082 --> 23:53.083
Veronica.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.393
Daddy.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.180
Where are Mom and Hermosa?

24:03.224 --> 24:04.791
I sent them to the club.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.018
Mija,I'm sorry.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.677
You deserve to hear
the truth from me.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.030
Why didn't you tell me?

24:32.949 --> 24:34.473
I didn't want the pity.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.609
I didn't want you
to see me as weak...

24:41.305 --> 24:42.306
ever.

24:42.959 --> 24:43.960
Daddy...

24:46.485 --> 24:50.489
all I want is to be
a source of strength for you.

24:54.797 --> 24:55.798
[voice falters] I love you.

24:58.627 --> 25:03.153
And we're going to
fight our way through this.

25:04.894 --> 25:05.895
Together.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.508
What can I do?

25:09.943 --> 25:10.944
Well...

25:18.386 --> 25:19.909
It would give me
peace of mind...

25:23.130 --> 25:25.306
if you'd just try to
get along with Hermosa.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.178
I mean, she's your family.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.006
Sisters.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.357
Okay, Daddy.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.536
[inhales deeply]
I'll try.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.505
[cell phone ringing]

25:56.685 --> 25:58.165
Mr. Jones,
is everything okay?

25:58.208 --> 25:59.993
I don't know yet, Betty,
but I got a lead.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.516
I, uh...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.387
[breathes deeply]

26:03.431 --> 26:06.347
I just got a call from a hiker
who found a bloody rock
in the woods

26:06.390 --> 26:08.175
at the same place where
the Stonewall party was.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.788
Oh, my God. Do you think...

26:12.832 --> 26:14.224
That it's Jughead's blood?

26:16.531 --> 26:18.185
Well, we won't know
till I get it tested.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.451
Can I do anything to help?

26:23.494 --> 26:25.235
Not at the moment, no.

26:25.279 --> 26:28.630
I have to go pick up the rock
and bring it back
to the station.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.980
Okay, will you... Will you
let me know what you find out?

26:31.024 --> 26:32.025
I will.

26:42.905 --> 26:47.475
Jellybean, do you have
any of that fake blood
left over from Halloween?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.217
Yeah, I think so.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.566
Can you find that for me?

27:01.576 --> 27:03.883
[Betty] Charles,
we have a problem.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.712
FP got a call about
a bloody rock that they found

27:06.755 --> 27:08.322
in the woods
behind Stonewall Prep.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.411
But you threw the bloody rock
in the swimming hole.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.413
[sighs] Exactly.
But think about it.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.024
The preppies must've known
that I would
get rid of the rock,

27:15.068 --> 27:18.027
so they must've had
a backup one with
Jughead's blood all over it.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.942
And I'm sure my prints
are on it, too.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.815
If they planted a murder weapon
covered in the victim's blood,

27:22.858 --> 27:25.034
and FP gets ahold of it,

27:25.078 --> 27:26.253
there's not much we can do.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.822
On the contrary.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.088
[indistinct radio chatter]

27:36.306 --> 27:37.917
Betty called me
and gave me a heads-up.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.618
-That's the rock they found?
-Yeah, it is.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.622
I'm gonna send it out
to the lab, have it tested,
see if it's a match.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.929
Listen, the local lab
will take a week or more.

27:49.972 --> 27:53.584
But if I send that to Quantico,
we'd know in two days, tops.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.771
So, I send this decoy
to Quantico?

28:05.814 --> 28:07.729
Put it down! Yes.

28:07.773 --> 28:12.299
They will test it
and discover that
it's fake blood.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.911
Just some prop
in a stupid prep school prank.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.565
This will buy us
a couple days, tops.

28:17.608 --> 28:18.784
Every second counts.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.049
What's their next move,
do you think?

28:26.182 --> 28:28.445
But that's not possible.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.796
And can I ask
what prompted this review?

28:35.191 --> 28:37.977
I see.
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that,

28:38.020 --> 28:41.371
but not as sorry as you'll be
to hear from my lawyer.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.462
-[sighs]
-That did not sound good.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.422
Barnard College
is reconsidering my admission.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.381
Apparently, they received
an anonymous tip

28:51.425 --> 28:54.602
that I'm running
an illegal liquor operation,
the Maple Club,

28:54.645 --> 28:56.822
and now my application
is under review.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.433
I'll give you one guess as to
where that call came from.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.348
-The Stonies.
-Who else?

29:01.391 --> 29:04.177
-It's like we're in a war.
-Yeah. Betty's war.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.528
And I'll follow her
to the ends of the earth,
but we need to know the truth

29:07.571 --> 29:09.748
about what happened
at the party, all of it.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.707
Before this gets any worse.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.579
-[Betty] What do you
wanna know?
-Everything.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.190
What do you mean?
I told you everything.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.582
That you can remember.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.977
But Betty, when Archie
and I found you,

29:22.021 --> 29:26.373
standing over Jughead's body,
you were holding the rock.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.288
There's no reason
you would've done that.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.769
You wouldn't have picked up
that rock. Not consciously.

29:36.513 --> 29:39.647
You're right.

29:39.690 --> 29:44.783
I would've... I should've been
trying to keep Jughead's brains
from falling out of his head.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.875
I think, maybe I...

29:51.528 --> 29:53.356
blacked out.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.229
-Why didn't you tell us?
-Because I'm scared.

29:56.272 --> 30:00.189
I'm terrified that
I might've done it.
That I might've...

30:00.233 --> 30:03.192
Whatever happened,
Betty, we're with you.

30:03.236 --> 30:06.065
But somehow we have to
figure out what happened...

30:06.108 --> 30:07.893
after your conversation
with Donna

30:07.936 --> 30:11.853
and before you woke up
next to Jughead's body.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.420
Do you remember anything?

30:13.463 --> 30:16.075
I don't, but I...

30:18.251 --> 30:22.821
I think Donna might have said
a trigger word that caused me
to hurt Jughead.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.214
"A trigger word."

30:26.346 --> 30:28.087
Like the kind they used
at the Farm?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.263
Yeah.

30:30.306 --> 30:31.568
Didn't Charles help you
with that?

30:33.483 --> 30:36.269
Maybe he can help again.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.839
-And we can all find out--
-What I did to Jughead.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.109
[Charles] All right, Betty.

30:50.152 --> 30:51.284
We're looking for missing time.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.461
Right before you woke up
next to Jughead.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.419
Start by just
letting yourself relax.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.465
I'm ready when you are.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.471
I'm ready.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.215
[clicking]

31:12.218 --> 31:15.569
Your mind and your body
are entering a deep state
of relaxation.

31:15.612 --> 31:20.313
I need you to try and recall
the events leading up
to the moment of your blackout.

31:20.356 --> 31:23.577
Try to remember the details
of your environment.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.536
Your movements,
your interactions that night.
[voice fading]

31:26.580 --> 31:28.495
[metronome continues clicking]

31:28.538 --> 31:30.453
Find yourself
back in that place.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.021
Inhale.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.458
Exhale.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.899
No, the other magic word.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.381
The one that makes you fugue...

31:45.425 --> 31:47.557
and hurt the people
who you love.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.603
You wanna hear it?

31:51.822 --> 31:52.823
[inaudible]

31:58.046 --> 31:58.917
I...

32:01.136 --> 32:04.357
Donna... Donna and I
were in the woods,

32:04.400 --> 32:08.143
and she blew this powder,
like, this white powder at me.

32:09.362 --> 32:10.450
I must've...

32:11.233 --> 32:12.191
breathed it in,

32:12.234 --> 32:14.845
then everything
just went black.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.326
Did she say anything?

32:17.370 --> 32:19.502
A trigger word? Or a phrase?

32:20.677 --> 32:22.984
I don't think...
I don't think she did.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.377
Maybe Donna's bluffing.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.989
Yeah, and maybe Evelyn
was just messing with me.

32:28.033 --> 32:31.079
-As for the powder,
it might be scopolamine.
-What the hell is that?

32:32.385 --> 32:34.430
It's commonly known
as Devil's Breath.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.998
It's a potent drug that blocks
certain neurotransmitters,

32:37.042 --> 32:39.479
affecting one's
short-term memory,
much like a blackout.

32:39.522 --> 32:45.006
When inhaled,
it leaves a victim disoriented,
but completely unaware.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.314
After inhaling
the Devil's Breath,

32:49.445 --> 32:51.839
would Betty
have been capable of--

32:51.882 --> 32:53.493
Delivering a killing blow
to Jughead?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.887
Doubtful.

32:56.931 --> 33:00.804
Much more likely,
she put that rock
in your hand herself,

33:00.848 --> 33:02.241
and spun you like a top.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.459
[sighs deeply]

33:06.288 --> 33:07.289
[message alert chimes]

33:18.170 --> 33:19.867
So, it's true what they say.

33:21.260 --> 33:24.219
A murderer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.091
I know what you did.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.789
You blew Devil's Breath
in my face.

33:28.832 --> 33:31.792
It wasn't some triggering word
you got from Evelyn Evernever.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.447
Although you did go
and visit her, which was...

33:34.490 --> 33:36.536
a great mislead. Congrats.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.191
Evelyn was more than happy
to help keep you guessing.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.106
She really hates you.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.717
You drugged me, Donna.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.893
You put a bloody rock
in my hand.

33:45.936 --> 33:51.116
But it was you or one of
your demented chums
who killed my boyfriend.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.292
Fascinating theory.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.511
Here's what I think you did.

33:55.555 --> 33:59.428
Rather than try to explain
to the authorities what you
were doing with a bloody rock

33:59.472 --> 34:01.996
standing over Jughead's corpse,

34:02.040 --> 34:04.738
you hid or got rid
of the body.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.480
Archie and Veronica helped you.
Am I right?

34:07.523 --> 34:10.004
No need to answer me.
I know that's what happened.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.616
Just like I know
Jughead's body
will never be found.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.574
Yeah? Why is that?

34:15.618 --> 34:19.013
Because if it was,
all of the forensic evidence
would lead to you, Betty.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.797
The crazy girlfriend with
a history of mental illness.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.105
The perfect murder.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
No body, no crime.

34:26.889 --> 34:28.588
-Now what?
-Now?

34:29.937 --> 34:31.286
Nothing.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.202
Jughead becomes
one of the Stonewall Five,

34:34.246 --> 34:36.204
and we go on with our lives.

34:41.556 --> 34:43.297
[Betty] Donna thinks
she's got it all figured out.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.518
And in a way, she does.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.129
Every move that we make,
the preppies make
a countermove,

34:48.172 --> 34:50.871
one that pulls us down
deeper and deeper.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.178
And we helped them
by taking care of the evidence.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.658
The problem is,
we've been playing defense.

34:55.702 --> 34:58.922
Making moves that,
of course, Donna would
be able to anticipate.

34:58.966 --> 35:02.187
-So?
-So we need to make
an unpredictable move that...

35:03.275 --> 35:05.494
blows up the game,
brings it to a head.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.020
I have a feeling I know
where this is going.

35:10.064 --> 35:13.415
Jughead's body
needs to be found
by Sheriff Jones.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.504
Not by the FBI,

35:15.548 --> 35:17.767
not by Stonewall security,

35:17.811 --> 35:19.987
and not by the local police.
It has to be him.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.295
We need to organize
a search party.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.911
Jughead!

35:30.954 --> 35:32.695
[all shouting]
Jughead! Jug!

35:47.014 --> 35:48.015
[distant shouts continue]

36:07.991 --> 36:10.472
Sheriff Jones, over here,
I think I found something!

36:13.519 --> 36:14.520
Stay back!

36:48.118 --> 36:49.685
[people clamoring]

37:13.361 --> 37:14.362
[inaudible]

37:24.198 --> 37:26.461
Archie, do you wanna talk?

37:32.859 --> 37:36.036
I'm so, so sorry about
what happened to Jughead.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.300
It's just tragic.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.042
It's just not fair.

37:43.522 --> 37:46.568
Losing your father,
and now your best friend.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.659
This is supposed to be
the best year of your life.

37:51.704 --> 37:52.792
Instead, it's just...

37:54.054 --> 37:55.316
full of devastation.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.121
Mom, I have to confess
something to you.

38:21.995 --> 38:22.822
[Veronica] Daddykins.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.346
Mijas.

38:25.390 --> 38:29.132
-What is it?
-Hermosa and I
have a proposal.

38:29.176 --> 38:32.701
We want to be named
co-executors of your estate.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.271
Well, I think
that's a great idea.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.100
I will have
Sowerberry write up
my new will immediately.

38:40.143 --> 38:43.799
And I'll be happy to see
you two shoulder-to-shoulder.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.758
At least until Veronica
heads off to Barnard.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.935
Yeah. And who knows,
maybe if my businesses
are going well,

38:48.978 --> 38:51.067
I'll defer my admission a year.

38:51.111 --> 38:53.418
You know, Barnard will
always be there, so...

39:01.251 --> 39:02.122
Hey, hermanita.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.822
What was that BS
about deferring Barnard?

39:08.084 --> 39:09.825
No one defers Barnard.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.046
Hermosa...

39:14.656 --> 39:19.313
we agreed to set aside
our differences
for Daddy's sake.

39:19.357 --> 39:24.710
And my circle of friends
is going through a huge loss.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.060
So...

39:27.103 --> 39:31.369
can you for one second
just stop being
such a suspicious bitch?

39:32.326 --> 39:34.284
Fine.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.896
It'll be more fun for me
to find out on my own.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.646
[twig cracking]

39:47.689 --> 39:49.691
We have to stop
meeting like this.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.608
People will say
we're in love.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.872
Why did you do it, Betty?

39:56.916 --> 40:00.441
Why reveal the body when
everything will just point back
to you and your cronies?

40:00.485 --> 40:02.182
Oh, gosh, Donna.

40:02.225 --> 40:05.011
Maybe it's because
I know you killed him.

40:05.054 --> 40:08.014
The man that I love.

40:08.057 --> 40:12.105
And if I'm going down,
you better be damn sure
I'm taking you down with me.

40:14.716 --> 40:18.372
As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.288
You and your Stonewall chums
think you know me,

40:22.463 --> 40:24.334
and what my next moves will be.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.208
I'm sorry, Donna...

40:29.905 --> 40:32.255
but I am the ultimate wildcard.

40:33.866 --> 40:36.825
I am the daughter
of the Black Hood,

40:36.869 --> 40:39.045
the nightmare
from next door.

40:39.088 --> 40:45.268
I'm training with the FBI
and I'm coming for you,
you psycho bitch.

40:45.312 --> 40:49.882
Not Joan, not Jonathan,
not even Bret.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.450
Just you.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.458
You're gonna regret
ever meeting me.

41:10.206 --> 41:13.906
Wait, so Donna just showed up
at the clearing on her own?

41:13.949 --> 41:15.168
Just like I told you
she would.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.607
Donna may not be showing it,
but she's scared.

41:20.173 --> 41:21.217
They all are.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.262
Finally.

41:23.698 --> 41:24.786
So, what do we do now?

41:25.613 --> 41:26.832
We wait, Arch.

41:28.224 --> 41:29.356
For what?

41:32.881 --> 41:34.622
For them to make
the next move.
