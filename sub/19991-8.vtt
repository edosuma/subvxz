00:57.590 --> 01:02.590
I wish to register
a complaint.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.530
An urchin!

01:07.540 --> 01:08.300
- Yuck!

01:08.300 --> 01:11.540
- Hey lady, take your infested
patty with you.

01:11.540 --> 01:14.070
Okay, no need to panic,
Squidward,

01:14.080 --> 01:15.440
It's just a puny urchin.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.510
Everything's gonna be fine
as long as you...

01:18.510 --> 01:21.610
smash it! Smash it!
Smash it!

01:24.050 --> 01:25.550
Phew.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.030
Squidward, I'm surprised at you.

01:35.030 --> 01:36.730
That little urchin
wasn't hurting anyone.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.160
He's still one
of Neptune's creatures,

01:39.170 --> 01:41.800
no matter how small he is.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.410
This is where the magic happens,
little urchin.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.040
First we turn up the heat,

01:48.040 --> 01:49.680
but don't make it too hot.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.410
Would you like to see
a menu, monsieur?

01:54.450 --> 01:55.750
- Ow!

01:58.190 --> 02:00.420
- Okay, little guy,
see you later.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.550
Good thing he is
a little guy.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.060
Ouch.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.229
Ah!

02:32.550 --> 02:33.650
What the shrimp?

02:33.650 --> 02:35.820
Hey, what's going on here?

02:35.820 --> 02:37.660
Whoa! That's too hot!

02:40.090 --> 02:43.400
Whoa!

02:44.630 --> 02:46.130
Wow.

02:46.130 --> 02:47.700
Oops.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.240
I steamed myself tiny.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.410
- Whoo-hoo!
I steamed myself tiny!

03:02.420 --> 03:04.550
Whoo!

03:04.550 --> 03:06.750
This place is huge!

03:08.490 --> 03:10.490
My spatula's huge.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.260
And just look at the size
of my grill.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.790
It's huge!

03:15.800 --> 03:18.630
Ow!

03:32.180 --> 03:33.680
Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow!

03:33.680 --> 03:35.750
Ahh!

03:35.750 --> 03:38.320
Ahh.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.650
Come on, flip.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.490
Wha--

03:54.600 --> 03:55.870
Uh-oh, the grill blew out.

03:55.870 --> 04:00.740
Well... it isn't going to fix itself.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.210
That's one small step
for SpongeBob,

04:04.210 --> 04:08.610
one giant leap for...
Wee!

04:08.620 --> 04:11.450
Whoa.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.220
Bob.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.620
Whew.
Oh!

04:17.630 --> 04:20.190
- What is that?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.760
- Hey,
it's my little urchin friend.

04:24.770 --> 04:27.630
Aww, hey, little guy.
Don't cry.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.640
Your old pal "Wee-Bob"
will get you out of there.

04:43.750 --> 04:47.720
Little urchin, you are
free to go. You okay?

04:53.230 --> 04:53.990
Yeouch!

05:04.410 --> 05:05.270
- Wah!

05:06.570 --> 05:08.710
- Sorry, little guy.

05:08.710 --> 05:09.840
Whoa!

05:09.840 --> 05:12.380
Whoa!

05:12.380 --> 05:14.280
- Whoa! Whoa!

05:14.610 --> 05:17.780
- Follow the pipes to freedom,
little guy.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.820
I'll never forget you.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.350
Really.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.520
Ow!

05:24.530 --> 05:25.990
What is all that noise?

05:25.990 --> 05:29.960
- One Krabby Patty!

05:29.960 --> 05:32.560
- Coming right up!

05:34.800 --> 05:38.370
- Urchin!
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!

05:45.610 --> 05:46.610
- Ah-ha!

05:46.610 --> 05:49.310
You're getting sloppy,
Plankton.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.950
Squidward almost squashed you.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.990
Back to the bucket with ya!

05:55.990 --> 05:59.830
- No! No, Mr. Krabs,
it's me!

06:05.730 --> 06:08.000
Ooh. That tickles.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.870
<i>- Well, SpongeBob SquarePants.</i>

06:09.870 --> 06:11.870
<i>it looks like you lost</i>
<i>a little weight.</i>

06:11.870 --> 06:13.910
- Oh, hi, Karen.
Where's Plankton?

06:13.910 --> 06:16.010
<i>- You landed on him.</i>

06:18.780 --> 06:21.450
- Hi, Plankton.

06:21.450 --> 06:24.850
"Spongeboob?"
Why are you so small?

06:24.850 --> 06:25.650
Is this a trick?

06:25.650 --> 06:27.650
<i>- Calm down, he's clean.</i>
<i>I frisked him.</i>

06:27.650 --> 06:30.720
- I didn't mean to get small
like you, Plankton.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.790
It was a freak accident.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.760
- Huh?
Who are you calling a freak?

06:34.760 --> 06:38.960
Wait a second.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.930
Hold this.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.670
You're not small like me,
shorty.

06:44.670 --> 06:49.840
I am a towering half
a millimeter taller than you.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.080
I win!

06:53.080 --> 06:55.350
- Hooray!

06:55.880 --> 06:58.380
- I'll get that.
- Don't touch that!

07:00.620 --> 07:02.350
- Oops.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.720
- Get him out of here,
Karen!

07:05.730 --> 07:07.830
<i>- Way ahead of you, chief.</i>

07:19.740 --> 07:21.440
- Cool.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.680
Ha ha! I found an action figure.

07:32.690 --> 07:34.950
- Whoa.
I saw it first.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.660
- No, I did.
- Finders keepers.

07:37.660 --> 07:38.820
- Whoa!

07:38.830 --> 07:41.390
- What's the matter with you?

07:41.930 --> 07:42.560
- Blech.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.960
- It's got my spit on it.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.900
- Whoa!
You can't catch me.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.140
- Don't let him get away.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.550
This is the best
action figure ever.

08:04.180 --> 08:08.150
- SpongeBob
in the corner pocket. Doink!

08:10.890 --> 08:13.190
- You brats get back
in the play area

08:13.190 --> 08:15.430
or I'll 86 your face!

08:16.630 --> 08:18.930
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

08:21.130 --> 08:25.070
We want our action figure back.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.070
- Ow!

08:27.810 --> 08:30.610
- Krusty Krab action figures
aren't free, you know.

08:30.610 --> 08:34.909
So get your parents' money
and you can have it.

08:38.890 --> 08:43.990
- Uh, Eugene, we don't sell
action figures.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.990
- Hmm.
- Peek-a-boo!

08:45.990 --> 08:47.490
- What the--

08:47.490 --> 08:49.830
- SpongeBob,
what are you doing in my hand?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.660
And why aren't you back there
flipping patties?

08:52.670 --> 08:55.200
- Sorry, Mr. K,
I shrunk myself by mistake,

08:55.200 --> 08:56.840
but I won't let it
affect my job.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.940
I will get back to flipping
right now.

09:00.470 --> 09:01.940
Hold on there, tiny.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.580
I can't have you working
the grill no more.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.110
Too dangerous for a little guy
like you.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.010
- Oh, please, Mr. Krabs, there
must be some job I could do.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.650
I don't care what it is.
Please, please, please?

09:12.650 --> 09:15.220
- All right,
I'll think of something.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.260
But since you're so small now,

09:17.260 --> 09:20.630
I can only pay you
a penny...a year.

09:20.630 --> 09:21.730
- Whoa!

09:21.730 --> 09:23.560
That's big money.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
Ow!
- Hmm.

09:24.570 --> 09:29.530
Now, what could I do
with a little SpongeBob?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.210
Oh, hmm.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.710
- Personal hygiene service?

09:40.810 --> 09:43.550
- Roll up your sleeves,
boy-o.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.690
You're a personal hygienist now.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.950
- Whoo-hoo! Yay!

09:54.090 --> 09:56.060
- Ahh!

10:00.230 --> 10:03.670
- Right there, yeah.

10:07.810 --> 10:10.110
- Ahh.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.550
Whew.

10:15.550 --> 10:17.050
<i>- Break time, SpongeBob.</i>

10:17.050 --> 10:18.680
<i>Take five,</i>
<i>but hurry back.</i>

10:18.690 --> 10:21.650
<i>You gotta start earning</i>
<i>that penny.</i>

10:25.960 --> 10:29.230
- Hmm. Work the register,
clean the windows,

10:29.230 --> 10:30.230
make the patties.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.960
I have to do everything now.

10:31.970 --> 10:35.000
Thanks a lot, "ShrinkBob."

10:37.100 --> 10:40.710
- It's okay, Squidward.
I'll make the patties for y--

10:40.710 --> 10:42.610
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

10:42.610 --> 10:45.080
I'm too little.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.280
Boy, I'm really going to miss
my old job.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.280
<i>- Lunch rush is over,</i>
<i>Mr. Squidward.</i>

10:50.280 --> 10:53.220
<i>Now, wash those dishes!</i>

10:53.220 --> 10:55.820
- "Lunch rush is over,
Mr. Squidward.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.220
Now, wash them dishes."

11:00.790 --> 11:03.660
The bubbles are
making me bigger.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.230
More bubbles!

11:05.230 --> 11:06.970
- What the?

11:06.970 --> 11:07.870
- Thank you, Squidward.

11:07.870 --> 11:11.300
I'm big enough
to flip patties again.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.680
- Whoa!

11:23.350 --> 11:27.090
- Mr. Squidward!
Call the fire department!

11:27.090 --> 11:29.650
- No need to call them,
Mr. Krabs.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.190
We'll be there in five minutes
depending on traffic.

11:33.190 --> 11:36.900
- Make a left at the light!

11:56.980 --> 11:58.950
Ahh.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.450
Phew!

12:02.090 --> 12:03.290
- What's that?

12:03.290 --> 12:05.160
- Looks like a box.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.830
- Wonder who it belongs to.

12:06.830 --> 12:10.100
Maybe it says on the other side.

12:10.100 --> 12:10.900
Nope.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.560
- Oh, look, it's open.

12:12.570 --> 12:13.500
- It is?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.470
Yup.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.540
- Ooh.

12:20.510 --> 12:22.270
It's--

12:22.280 --> 12:24.040
it's--

12:25.050 --> 12:26.180
It's stuff!

12:26.180 --> 12:28.180
Oh, I knew it!

12:28.180 --> 12:31.150
But what does this stuff do?

12:32.520 --> 12:33.320
Hmm.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.390
- Ah, this must be for getting
books off the top shelf.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.590
- Hey!

12:39.590 --> 12:41.460
Oh!

12:41.460 --> 12:44.360
Hmm. Mm.

12:47.370 --> 12:50.270
Wow.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.840
This is must be
a whipped cream holder.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.510
Mmm.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.450
- Ah!
Patrick, are you okay?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.090
Yum.

13:13.230 --> 13:15.230
- Meow.
- This must be

13:15.230 --> 13:17.530
a portable snail bed.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.430
♪ Rock-a-bye Gary ♪

13:19.430 --> 13:20.900
- I wanna try!

13:20.900 --> 13:22.100
- Meow.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.410
- Aww.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.550
Oh, it may have taken you
all morning, Squidward,

13:34.550 --> 13:38.420
but this is a meal
fit for a king.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.420
Oh.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.890
My croque-madame is ready.

13:46.230 --> 13:48.160
What the--

13:51.430 --> 13:52.630
SpongeBob! Patrick!

13:52.630 --> 13:55.470
What do you two
think you're--

13:55.470 --> 13:56.130
wow.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.310
Hiyah!

14:04.240 --> 14:05.640
- My begonias!

14:05.650 --> 14:11.180
What are you lunk heads doing
with all this equipment?

14:11.180 --> 14:12.650
Equipment?

14:12.650 --> 14:17.020
- You don't know
what this stuff is?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.960
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.990
- This is a soccer ball...

14:20.990 --> 14:24.530
that is a tennis racket,
and these...

14:24.530 --> 14:26.630
are a couple of morons.

14:28.170 --> 14:29.130
Now, be quiet!

14:29.140 --> 14:32.400
And clean up
all of your sports junk!

14:33.040 --> 14:35.310
What's a "sportz"?

14:35.310 --> 14:38.180
Sports are games

14:38.180 --> 14:39.040
you play for points.

14:39.050 --> 14:42.050
The points determine
the winner of the game.

14:42.050 --> 14:44.420
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
I love games!

14:44.420 --> 14:46.380
- Me too!
You must know a lot

14:46.390 --> 14:47.620
about "sportz," Squidward.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.990
Will you teach us
how to play?

14:48.990 --> 14:53.390
- I can't think of anything
I'd rather do less than--

14:54.290 --> 14:58.030
- Now now, Squidward.
You need to help them.

14:58.030 --> 15:02.600
Played incorrectly,
sports can be very dangerous.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
- Yeah, he's right.
You should teach 'em

15:04.600 --> 15:09.570
to play wrong,
'cause it's payback time.

15:10.740 --> 15:14.510
Let 'em have it,
right between the eyes.

15:14.710 --> 15:19.450
- You know, on second thought,
I'd be happy to teach you

15:19.450 --> 15:22.550
all about sports,
SpongeBob.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.130
All right, the object
of this game

15:28.130 --> 15:32.660
is to throw the horseshoe
around the stick.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.000
- Ah, seems easy enough.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.300
- Sure, but you have to do it...
blindfolded.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.780
Um, do we throw now?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.650
- Yes.
- At the same time?

15:48.650 --> 15:52.580
- Yes! Throw it
at the same time. Throw.

15:52.590 --> 15:53.520
- Hiyah!

15:56.090 --> 15:57.360
- Ow!

15:57.360 --> 16:00.760
Aw, we didn't hit the sticks.
Did we do bad?

16:01.360 --> 16:02.090
- My face hurts.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.660
- Oh, no, no, no.
You both did good.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.030
Pain is--
uh, worth points.

16:08.030 --> 16:12.770
You know the phrase,
"no pain, no gain."

16:14.210 --> 16:16.340
I want pain points!

16:18.680 --> 16:19.810
- Yeah, that's great.

16:19.810 --> 16:23.350
Now do it--
oh, 100 more times.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.820
- Yeah!

16:27.490 --> 16:29.050
Ow!

16:32.360 --> 16:36.190
- Oh, Squiddy,
you're a genius.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.300
- Squidward, can the game
be over now?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.200
All this pain is
starting to hurt.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.500
- Oh, sorry.
There's no way to end the game

16:43.500 --> 16:45.400
without one of you winning.

16:47.410 --> 16:50.510
- Ready...set...go!

17:01.920 --> 17:03.520
Squidward, are you sure
we're doing this right?

17:03.520 --> 17:06.119
These running shoes are
really hurting my ankles.

17:06.130 --> 17:08.490
- Oh, you're absolutely
doing it right.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.359
Try to pick up the pace,
though.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.300
Comin' through!

17:16.270 --> 17:17.670
- I wanna play, Daddy.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.240
- No, son.
We're sports "fans."

17:21.240 --> 17:23.140
We just watch.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.210
- And...time.

17:26.910 --> 17:29.650
Let's see those ankles.

17:32.150 --> 17:35.450
Oh, yeah, those look bad.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.120
You both get--
mm, 50 points.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.860
Why not?
- Hey, then we're still tied!

18:14.190 --> 18:15.860
- Hmm. Hmm.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.330
Where is it!
Where is it?

18:17.330 --> 18:20.260
Hmm. Ah-ha!
There's my box of sports gear.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.170
It must've fallen
off the mail truck.

18:22.170 --> 18:23.840
But what happened
to all the equipment?

18:25.870 --> 18:27.510
What was that?

18:29.310 --> 18:29.770
Huh?

18:29.780 --> 18:31.910
SpongeBob, what's going on?

18:31.910 --> 18:34.350
- Oh, hey--Sandy.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.610
Patrick and I are--

18:35.620 --> 18:36.810
in the middle
of a sports game.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.650
- This sure don't look

18:38.650 --> 18:41.190
like any sport
I've seen before.

18:41.860 --> 18:45.760
- I believe it's called
kickboxing, or something?

18:45.760 --> 18:50.830
- Well, whatever it is, it seems
to be causing you lots of pain.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.930
- Ow!
Sure is.

18:52.930 --> 18:53.530
Ooh!

18:53.530 --> 18:56.330
- Why not stop playing it
if it hurts so bad?

18:56.340 --> 18:57.400
- We can't stop...

18:57.400 --> 19:00.840
Until we break our tie.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.740
- Says who?

19:03.940 --> 19:06.610
- It's the rule giver.

19:13.590 --> 19:15.950
- I ain't never heard
of a rule giver.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.660
- I prefer
"King of Sports,"

19:18.660 --> 19:22.390
but you can never tell what will
catch on with the small folk.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.960
- You're making up a game
where SpongeBob and Patrick

19:24.960 --> 19:27.630
hurt themselves,
and you won't let them stop?

19:27.630 --> 19:30.540
- I'm just giving the people
what they want.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.840
- That's pretty low, Squidward,
even for you.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.010
I'm putting a stop to this.

19:35.010 --> 19:38.240
SpongeBob and Patrick
have had enough!

19:39.710 --> 19:41.680
- See?
They're fine.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.320
Let the games resume.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.320
Oh, I don't think so.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.490
Y'all want to see a game?
Fine.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.890
Squidward, I challenge you
to a game--

19:53.890 --> 19:55.360
a game of basketball.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.660
Winner decides the fate
of SpongeBob and Patrick.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.700
Huh?

20:02.700 --> 20:03.830
Me? Play sports?

20:03.840 --> 20:07.040
No, no. I'm mostly
in an advisory position.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.780
- Aw, come on!
We came to see some action.

20:10.780 --> 20:14.050
Play the squirrel!
Play the squirrel!

20:14.050 --> 20:17.480
Play the squirrel!
Play the squirrel!

20:17.480 --> 20:20.790
- See you on the court,
Your Highness.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.620
- Hey, Squidward,
one more thing.

20:26.630 --> 20:31.330
We're playing
San Antonio rules.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.530
- San "A-what-io" rules?

20:32.530 --> 20:34.470
- Check.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.340
- Oh, that was a foul.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.840
- Tell it to yo Mama,
Squidward.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.510
- Mama?

20:44.510 --> 20:46.610
- Don't want to hear it.

20:46.610 --> 20:47.880
- Next round's soccer.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
- What the what?
- Sure.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.950
Every time you score,
you pick a new sport.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.680
I thought you knew
all the rules, Squidward.

20:52.690 --> 20:55.920
- Well, uh, yeah, well,
of course I do. Yeah.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.320
- Good, then block this.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.920
- Block what?

21:00.730 --> 21:01.890
- Ha!

21:09.470 --> 21:12.340
- Oh, come on,
I wasn't even ready.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.840
- No time outs.
Football round!

21:23.750 --> 21:27.890
Just give me a second to--

21:53.910 --> 21:59.020
- And the winner is...
Sandy Cheeks.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.990
- Good game, Squidward.

22:01.990 --> 22:02.850
- Ow, ow, ow.

22:02.860 --> 22:05.560
- Wow, Sandy.
That was amazing.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.660
- Yeah, I liked the part

22:06.660 --> 22:09.990
where you did that thing
with the ball and stuff.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.700
Thanks, boys.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.860
Looks like we're
all done here.

22:12.870 --> 22:16.800
That goes for you too.
I'm ending your game.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.900
But we're still tied.

22:19.910 --> 22:22.410
- Don't worry,
I'm declaring you both winners.

22:22.410 --> 22:26.940
Yeah! We're winners!
We're winners! We're winners!

22:26.950 --> 22:28.480
- Aww, don't worry,
Squidward.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.850
You're a winner too.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.950
- I hate winning.

22:34.190 --> 22:37.720
Ow.
