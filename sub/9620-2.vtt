THERE'S TWO IDEAS RIGHT THERE.

06:50.943 --> 06:51.878
&gt;&gt; LULU, BE SERIOUS.

06:51.944 --> 06:52.979
MR. MADIGAN WAS CLEAR

06:53.045 --> 06:53.813
WANTING EVERYONE TO THINK

06:53.880 --> 06:55.214
OF SOMETHING.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.015
&gt;&gt; MY AUNT, EMILY TOLD ME

06:56.082 --> 06:56.549
A GREAT TRICK

06:56.616 --> 06:57.183
FOR WHEN YOU REALLY NEED

06:57.250 --> 06:57.884
TO THINK OF SOMETHING.

06:57.950 --> 06:58.618
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T YOUR AUNT EMILY

06:58.684 --> 06:59.552
LIVE IN A TENT?

06:59.619 --> 07:00.419
&gt;&gt; JUST 'CAUSE IT'S FUN.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.022
SHE HAS A GIANT HOUSE, TOO.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.457
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WHAT'S HER IDEA?

07:04.524 --> 07:05.358
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID TO SHUT YOUR EYES

07:05.424 --> 07:06.159
REALLY HARD

07:06.225 --> 07:07.160
THEN TURN AROUND ONCE

07:07.226 --> 07:08.161
AND THEN OPEN THEM.

07:08.227 --> 07:08.895
AND THE FIRST THING YOU SEE,

07:08.961 --> 07:11.664
THAT'LL LEAD YOU TO YOUR IDEA.

07:11.731 --> 07:12.532
TRY IT, WHAT DO YOU HAVE

07:12.598 --> 07:17.003
TO LOSE?

07:17.069 --> 07:17.703
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE FIRST THING

07:17.770 --> 07:18.938
YOU SEE?

07:19.005 --> 07:19.906
&gt;&gt; A TV REMOTE.

07:19.972 --> 07:23.810
&gt;&gt; TURN IT ON.

07:23.876 --> 07:24.777
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS BEEN<i> JUST THE FACTS.</i>

07:24.844 --> 07:25.812
I'M BURT BURLINGTON,

07:25.878 --> 07:26.879
REMINDING YOU TO LOOK FOR ME,

07:29.882 --> 07:31.250

07:37.223 --> 07:38.191

07:44.764 --> 07:45.631
&gt;&gt; THE COAT?

07:45.698 --> 07:47.366
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.167
IT'D BE GREAT PUBLICITY

07:48.234 --> 07:49.302
FOR THE COMPANY.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.503
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S ALMOST

07:50.570 --> 07:51.270
AS GOOD AS THE IDEA

07:51.337 --> 07:52.705

08:18.998 --> 08:20.166
I DID YOU THAT FAVOR?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.534
&gt;&gt; NO.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.592
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN,

12:39.658 --> 12:40.893
YOU DON'T HATE ANYBODY, DO YOU?

12:40.960 --> 12:41.927
&gt;&gt; NO, HATE IS AN AWFULLY

12:41.994 --> 12:42.461
STRONG WORD.

12:42.528 --> 12:43.329
WHO'RE YOU THINKING OF?

12:43.395 --> 12:43.929
&gt;&gt; BURT BURLINGTON.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.031
&gt;&gt; I HATE THAT GUY!

12:46.098 --> 12:47.466
&gt;&gt; BUT WHY?

12:47.533 --> 12:48.134
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO TALK

12:48.200 --> 12:49.668
ABOUT IT.

12:49.735 --> 12:50.169
&gt;&gt; LET'S SAY,

12:50.236 --> 12:51.737
FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE,

12:51.804 --> 12:52.938
I DESIGNED A MAD STYLE COAT

12:53.005 --> 12:54.273
FOR HIM TO WEAR IN THE PARADE,

12:54.340 --> 12:56.242
THAT'D BE A GOOD THING, RIGHT?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.543
&gt;&gt; LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY,

12:57.610 --> 12:58.744
IF I SEE A MAD STYLE COAT

12:58.811 --> 13:00.012
ON BURT BURLINGTON,

13:00.079 --> 13:02.548
I WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.816
&gt;&gt; OH MAN, THAT'S WORSE

13:03.883 --> 13:04.884
THAN GETTING FIRED.

13:04.950 --> 13:05.584
&gt;&gt; THEN I'D FIRE

13:05.651 --> 13:11.090
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

13:11.157 --> 13:11.857
&gt;&gt; WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

13:11.924 --> 13:12.558
I ALREADY GAVE

13:12.625 --> 13:13.993
BURT BURLINGTON THE COAT.

13:14.059 --> 13:14.760
&gt;&gt; MAYBE MR. MADIGAN

13:14.827 --> 13:15.995
WON'T FIND OUT.

13:16.061 --> 13:16.462
&gt;&gt; HOW?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.297
IT'S GONNA BE ON NATIONAL TV.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.431
&gt;&gt; DID YOU TELL MAX?

13:19.498 --> 13:19.999

13:23.602 --> 13:25.471
&gt;&gt; WHY DOES HE HATE HIM ANYWAY?

13:25.538 --> 13:26.772
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE FIVE YEARS AGO,

13:26.839 --> 13:28.641
MAX APPEARED AS A CONTESTANT

13:28.707 --> 13:30.409
ON HIS SHOW.
