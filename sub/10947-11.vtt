Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?

01:03.610 --> 01:05.360
Right. Got it.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.860
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp

01:07.950 --> 01:09.030
on top of the tent.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.870
You know, so we don't get rained on?

01:11.330 --> 01:12.830
Ordinarily, you'd be right,

01:12.910 --> 01:14.200
but seeing how it's the dry season,

01:14.290 --> 01:15.290
you're not.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.040
Besides, that tarp makes
a pretty warm blanket.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.630
But what if it does rain?

01:18.750 --> 01:19.830
What if it doesn't?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.670
Then I would have put
the tarp up for nothing.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.340
Uh! You're infuriating.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.630
Katara, why don't you worry about
gathering the firewood?

01:26.760 --> 01:30.140
Because that kindling's
looking pretty sorry.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.060

gonna do your job―

Okay, I got the grub

01:39.900 --> 01:41.480
Hey, where's the campfire,

01:41.610 --> 01:43.070
and what happened to the tent?

01:43.190 --> 01:46.030

Okay. I've seen enough.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.290
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka?

02:41.420 --> 02:44.000
This is the largest canyon
in the entire world.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.380
Then I'm sure we'll be
able to see it very clearly

02:46.500 --> 02:48.010
from the air while we fly away.

02:48.130 --> 02:49.590
Hey, if you're looking
for the canyon guide,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.010
I was here first.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.470
Ooh. Canyon guide. Sounds informative.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.640
Believe me, he's more
than a tour guide.

02:56.770 --> 02:57.810
He's an earthbender,

02:57.930 --> 02:59.480
and the only way
in and out of the canyon

02:59.600 --> 03:00.980
is with his help.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.230
And he's taking my tribe across next.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.110
Calm down. We know you're next.

03:05.230 --> 03:07.570
You wouldn't be calm if the
Fire Nation destroyed your home

03:07.690 --> 03:08.990
and forced you to flee.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.150
My whole tribe has to
walk thousands of miles

03:11.240 --> 03:13.780

Huh. Tell me something I don't know.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.660
Is that your tribe?

03:21.790 --> 03:23.120
It most certainly is not.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.920
That's the Zhang tribe,

03:25.040 --> 03:26.710

Still tidying up their campsite?

Yes, but they sent me
ahead of them to hold a spot.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.810
I didn't know the canyon guide
took reservations.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.770
Huh! Of course you didn't.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.320

04:10.260 --> 04:12.760
Uh, one of them, I think.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.840
I was here first.
My party's on their way.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.600
I can't guide people who aren't here.

to make the trip tomorrow.

You're not seriously gonna cave in

04:33.400 --> 04:35.490
I mean, we're refugees, too,

that need shelter.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.580
I, uh, well...

04:39.990 --> 04:42.370
We've got old people
who are weary from traveling.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.080
Sick people get
priority over old people.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.580
Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't
have so many sick people

I'm sure he can come up
with a compromise

05:12.650 --> 05:14.440

Uh, you could share the earthbender
and travel together?

05:20.370 --> 05:22.910
Absolutely not. We'd rather
be taken by the Fire Nation

05:23.040 --> 05:25.500
than travel with those
stinking thieves.

how canyons are formed.

Experts tell us
this canyon was most likely

07:17.030 --> 07:20.110
carved into the ground
by earth spirits,

07:20.190 --> 07:22.780
who were angry at local farmers

of ditching our food

was so we wouldn't have to deal
with things like canyon crawlers.

can't go without food for a day,

that tribe of thieves

isn't smuggling food?

Well, I guess it's okay
if everyone's doing it.

hate the Zhangs so much?

GAN JIN: <i>The patriarch</i>
<i>of our tribe, Jin Wei,</i>

11:59.930 --> 12:01.430
<i>was an earthbender warrior</i>

12:01.560 --> 12:03.810
<i>who was assigned an important duty:</i>

12:03.940 --> 12:06.110
<i>Transporting our sacred orb</i>

12:06.230 --> 12:09.820
<i>From the great eastern gate
to the great western gate.</i>

12:15.110 --> 12:17.030
<i>Taking the orb
from the east to the west</i>

12:17.160 --> 12:20.330
<i>represents the sun's
rising and setting.</i>

12:20.450 --> 12:24.620
<i>It was our tribe's
ancient redemption ritual.</i>

12:24.750 --> 12:26.630
<i>But as he approached the gate,</i>

12:26.750 --> 12:29.920
<i>Jin Wei was attacked
by one of the Zhangs―</i>

12:30.050 --> 12:32.170
<i>A vermin named Wei Jin</i>

12:32.300 --> 12:35.300
<i>who looked at the orb with envy.</i>

12:35.430 --> 12:39.010
<i>That coward Wei Jin
knocked Jin Wei to the ground</i>

12:39.140 --> 12:41.140
<i>and stole our sacred orb.</i>

12:42.810 --> 12:45.310
Our people have never forgotten.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.020
You can never trust a Zhang.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.660
Mmm-hmm.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.620
The Gan Jins think so badly of us,

13:05.750 --> 13:07.710
they probably assumed
we brought food in

13:07.830 --> 13:09.670
and decided to bring
food in themselves.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.300
That's why we brought food in.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.420
Mmm.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.130

ZHANG: <i>Our forefather, Wei Jin,</i>
<i>was leaving the western gate</i>

a figure in the distance.</i>

13:35.110 --> 13:38.030
<i>Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,</i>

13:38.110 --> 13:41.950
<i>a very powerful relic used in
his tribe's redemption ritual.</i>

13:42.450 --> 13:44.540
<i>Wei Jin tried to tend
to the man's wounds,</i>

13:44.620 --> 13:47.830
<i>but Jin Wei insisted the orb
was more important</i>

13:47.920 --> 13:50.630
<i>and asked him to take it
back to his tribe.</i>

13:50.710 --> 13:53.630
<i>Kind Wei Jin promised to send
help for the man</i>

13:53.710 --> 13:54.880
<i>as soon as he could.</i>

13:55.130 --> 13:57.130
<i>But as Wei Jin crossed the border</i>

13:57.220 --> 13:59.140
<i>to return the orb
into Gan Jin territory,</i>

13:59.220 --> 14:00.720

wronged the Gan Jins.

Yeah, Katara, what

Wei Jin didn't steal the orb.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.860
He was returning it
to their village gate

15:37.940 --> 15:39.740

punished by the Gan Jin.
