00:02.435 --> 00:04.070
( bell rings )

00:04.104 --> 00:06.539
<i>*  When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:09.476
    <i>*  I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.509 --> 00:12.445
 <i>*  By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.479 --> 00:16.149
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:19.619
  <i>*  It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.755 --> 00:24.758
  <i>*  If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:27.761
   <i>*  And my dog ate</i>

  <i>*  Ridin' low in my chair</i>

  <i>* If I can hand</i>

  <i>it'll be all right</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:37.871
  <i>*  It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.686 --> 00:55.555

00:58.658 --> 01:02.495
 <i>*  It's all right</i>

   <i>by the bell *</i>

01:09.235 --> 01:12.505
 Miss Bliss: <i>People</i>
 <i>learning to work together</i>
 <i>is a wonderful thing.</i>

01:12.539 --> 01:14.708
 <i>It means they have to</i>
 <i>listen to each other,</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:18.778
<i>consider</i>
<i>different points of view</i>
<i>and reach a compromise.</i>

01:18.812 --> 01:21.114
  <i>My only problem is,</i>

01:21.147 --> 01:22.782
<i>how do you teach that?</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:25.852
   A cute girl
   looking for
   a place to sit on the bus

01:25.885 --> 01:28.822
 is no reason to push
 me off my seat, Zack.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.824
   The bus, lurched.

01:30.857 --> 01:33.626
We were at a red light.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.231
  Now, today is the day
  we start our team projects.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.835
 Mind if I sit down
 or you think
 the room will lurch?

01:41.868 --> 01:45.572
  Now, can someone tell me,
  what these items
  have in common?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.707
   Well,
   they're all on your desk.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.910
  They're all famous
  American inventions, Zack.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.346
 Sure, go for the easy answer.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.749
And more specifically,

01:55.782 --> 01:59.219
  they were all
  invented in the late 1800s.

01:59.252 --> 02:02.555
Now, can anyone
tell me what this does?

02:02.589 --> 02:05.191
 This is just a wild guess,
 Miss Bliss.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.161
 It lights up!

02:08.193 --> 02:11.564
  I think Bliss has
  been working around
  the rubber cement.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.800
  My point is, Mikey

02:13.833 --> 02:17.303
that when the light bulb,
the camera,
the phone were invented

02:17.337 --> 02:20.573
  people didn't
  just accept them,
  they had questions.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.410
 People actually
 questioned the phone?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.545
 -That's right.
 -That's sick.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.715
So, your project today

02:28.748 --> 02:31.751
  is to convince me to
  buy your invention.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.187
  As if I'd never ever
  heard of it before.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.690
   Okay?
   Right, now for the teams.

02:36.723 --> 02:40.193
 Samuel,
 your invention is the camera

02:40.226 --> 02:41.695
 and you'll team with Jennifer.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.231
Bless you.
Bless you, Miss Bliss.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.937
  Lisa and Mikey,
  your invention
  is the typewriter.

02:50.970 --> 02:54.407
   The typewriter?
   But I'll break my nails!

02:54.441 --> 02:56.576
And I just bought them.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.679
  Don't sweat it, Lisa.
  I'll do the typing.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.348
I grow my own.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.551
 Lemme tell you
 another thing, Zack.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.354
That girl wasn't
even that cute.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.588
  I'll be charitable.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.190
   She was a three.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.159
I wouldn't knock you on
the floor for a three.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.395
 She was a five with potential.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.798
   You are such a pig, Zack.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.769
   Our next invention
   is the telephone.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.205
Nikki and Zack.

03:25.238 --> 03:29.275
Since you seem to be having
such a good time
talking to each other.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.877
It's all yours.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.392
 ( doorbell ringing )

03:54.401 --> 03:57.437
   Tina, it's past midnight!

03:57.470 --> 03:59.506
  Life as I know it,

03:59.539 --> 04:01.675
   is over.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.511
  Couldn't you have called
  and told me about
  it in the morning?

04:04.544 --> 04:05.812
  No!

04:05.845 --> 04:08.214
 Thanks to you,
 I don't have a phone.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.950
   -Or a bed or
   a roof over my head.
   -Okay.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.520
 Tina, just slow down.
 Now what is going on?

04:13.553 --> 04:15.822
  I did exactly what
  you told me to do.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.791
   -What was that?
   -I threatened to break up

04:17.824 --> 04:19.793
 with Donny,
 unless he married me.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.594
But I never told
you to do that!

04:21.628 --> 04:25.432
  Yes you did.
  You said,
  "Honesty will always work."

04:26.800 --> 04:28.268
  Oh.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.704
-And?
-And he kicked me out.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.074
  He rented my
  apartment to somebody else.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.876
   Wonder where he found
   a tenant in
   the middle of the night!

04:37.911 --> 04:40.914
Who cares?
I am out in the street.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.584
  No you're not.
  You're gonna stay
  right here with me.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.487
Thanks, Carrie.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.323
Come to think of it.
What are you doing up?

04:50.357 --> 04:54.461
I've got a deadline to make
for my article for
<i>Good Earth</i> magazine.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.864
  What's good about it?
  Carrie, I'm sorry.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.933
  I'm just so upset.

05:00.033 --> 05:04.237
   Look, Tina.
   You've just got to remember.
   It's Donny's loss.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.874
  You're right. You're right.
  Life goes on for everyone.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.810
But me.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.447
  Tina, come on,
  everything will be all right.
  I promise.

05:17.717 --> 05:18.752
 ( grunting )

05:21.321 --> 05:23.423
   ( sighs )

05:23.456 --> 05:27.727
Tina!
What is a broom stick doing
in my garbage disposal?

05:27.761 --> 05:31.331
   Would you believe
   there is a witch
   on the other end of this?

05:32.732 --> 05:34.334
   Okay, Tina. Out with it.

05:34.367 --> 05:40.440
 Well, it all started when I
 was cleaning up and the
 disposal ate your dish towels.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.709
   What was my dish
   towel doing in the sink?

05:42.742 --> 05:45.712
  Well I had to use it
  to remove the broken glass.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.414
 Broken glass?

05:47.447 --> 05:50.350
   -As in my good
   crystal goblets?
   -Goblet.

05:50.383 --> 05:54.487
Tina. These have been
in my family 50 years.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.691
  I am so sorry, Carrie.
  It was an accident.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.461
When the disposal jammed,
I tried to loosen it
with the broom handle.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.830
I saw Donny do it once.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.833
   He was so good
   at those things.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.769
-Donny.
-It's all right, Tina.
It's all right.

06:09.803 --> 06:13.406
 Don't worry.
 I'll call the plumber.
 So how are you this morning?

06:15.575 --> 06:19.346
  Well, actually I was feeling
  a lot better this morning.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.815
   I woke up,
   I put a smile on my face

06:21.848 --> 06:25.952
  and I said to myself,
  "Tina, take destiny
  in your own hands,

06:26.052 --> 06:28.855
  "slash his tires."

06:28.888 --> 06:31.925
 -That's healthy.
 -Speaking of healthy.

06:31.958 --> 06:36.629
   I made you a special
   high-fiber protein drink.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.766
  I think I'll get my
  fiber from my bran muffin.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.837
 -Well, I...
 -You ate it?

06:44.637 --> 06:45.905
 Not exactly.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.975
 I used it for the fiber
 in the protein drink.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.077
 Fine.

06:51.077 --> 06:55.115
Look, I just have time
for a nice hot shower.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.517
 And then it's off to school.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.486
   You know,

06:59.519 --> 07:03.023
   I read that hot showers
   are not
   necessarily a good thing.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.728
-Tina!
-You see I
already took my shower.

07:08.762 --> 07:13.566
  You know, it's amazing how
  quickly an hour goes by when
  you're in a love coma.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
   Okay look, Zack.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.375
 Let's just
 forget about yesterday
 and get going on the project.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.377
  -It's fine with me.
  -All right.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.814
 I did some research and I have
 a lot of facts and
 figures to go over.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.050
   Wait, slow down.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.618
-Facts and figures?
-Yeah.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.720
   These are not good words.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.723
 Trust me, this
 project is all presentation.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.492
   Have I ever
   steered you wrong before?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.095
Let me put that
in another way.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.363
Boring.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.933
 Forget it, Zack.
 I'm not gonna let you
 mess up this project.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.438
 For your information, I worked
 up a fantastic
 presentation last night.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.073
Did you spend more
than five minutes on it?

07:53.073 --> 07:54.941
Yes I spent more
than five minutes on it.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.944
 -More than 10?
 -No. But it was quality time.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.013
( bell rings )

08:00.013 --> 08:02.682
   Listen, we'll talk.
   We'll have lunch.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.121
  Did we really have to
  drive by Donny's
  house three times?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.857
 I wanted to catch
 a glimpse of his new trollop.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.393
   Wait a second, that
   makes me his old trollop.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.862
  -Forget what I said.
  -Tina, we're late.

08:15.895 --> 08:19.065
   Boy, we're
   a little bit off schedule
   and you bite my head off.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.801
 -What is the big deal?
 -You tell me.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.436
  It's inconsiderate,
  irresponsible

08:23.470 --> 08:25.839
and it will never happen
again, Mr. Belding.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.407
 Nice jacket.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.712
  Miss Bliss,
  it's not like you to be late.
  Is everything all right?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.681
  Everything's fine, really.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.950
  Because if it isn't,
  you know you can
  always come to me.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.818
 I'm fine, thank you.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.587
  Okay, I just thought that
  after 11 years of
  working together,

08:41.621 --> 08:43.556
  we'd be able to
  share our problems.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.493
 All right.
 I didn't get much sleep,
 I didn't have any breakfast,

08:46.526 --> 08:50.163
  I had a cold shower
  and my hair is still wet.
  You happy now?

08:52.465 --> 08:55.535
  Well I wish she'd leave
  her personal life at home.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.883
Stop gawking at me.
We're supposed to be
discussing the project!

09:09.916 --> 09:11.685
 Do you believe in
 love at first sight?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.520
  No.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.755
  Good,
  then I've still got a shot.

09:18.458 --> 09:23.563
 Now, my first chart shows the
 distance the average farmer
 was from his neighbor.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.798
 Whoa.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.466
   That oughtta grab
   their attention.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.668
 And this chart shows,

09:28.702 --> 09:32.472
   that not only will the phone
   reach your neighbor,
   but other states.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.040
 Ooh.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.608
Let me catch my breath.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.044
-Zack, will you cut it out?
-Nikki!

09:38.044 --> 09:40.513
 You're talking
 the big snooze here.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.782
 Now I'll show you
 a real presentation.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.553
  First, I'll get on one phone
  and you'll get on another.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.789
-Yeah.
-And I'll be
Alexander Graham Bell.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.526
 -And you'll be Ma Bell.
 -Excuse me, Ma Bell?

09:53.560 --> 09:56.730
 You can be Taco
 Bell for all I care.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.166
 -I'm flexible.
 -This is so
 typical of you, Zack.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.870
You just wanna goof around.
You never take
anything seriously.

10:03.903 --> 10:07.540
 Well I've had it.
 Ma Bell is putting you
 on hold, permanently.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.744
 So what? I got call waiting.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.025
 Tina! Please.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.328
( singing along
to headphones )

10:31.031 --> 10:32.298
  Tina, Tina.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.235
 I have to finish my article.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.004
   Okay, I can take a hint.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.907
 I'll just go in the kitchen.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.844
  Before I forget, I invited my
  therapy group
  here Thursday night.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.279
 It's my week.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.151
  This is beautiful.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.020
Hide it. The group
tends to throw things.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.355
  Tina, Tina.

10:57.357 --> 11:02.228
   I was wondering, have you...
   Have you found
   a place to live yet?

11:02.262 --> 11:05.632
Not yet. And I know
what you're gonna say.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.835
 "Why look for place,
 when you have
 plenty of room here?"

11:08.868 --> 11:12.739
 We'll be roomies.
 We'll split the rent.

11:12.772 --> 11:16.943
 Well, maybe we won't split the
 rent. I mean after all you do
 have the bigger bedroom.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.946
  -Tina...
  -Okay,
  okay we'll split the rent.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.215
 But I get the bathroom
 first in the morning.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.084
Listen.

11:24.117 --> 11:28.755
   It's not working,
   you're driving me crazy.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.959
  You're gonna have to leave.
  I'm... I'm sorry,
  I hope you understand.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.931
  Of course.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.266
 I'm a very
 understanding person.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.105
Could you, help me out
with one little thing?

11:45.772 --> 11:47.240
Sure, anything.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.678
   Why is it that all
   the people I love

11:51.711 --> 11:53.113
 kick me out?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.856
   <i>Testing.</i>

12:05.058 --> 12:06.626
   <i>Testing.</i>

12:06.659 --> 12:07.894
   <i>Does it work now, Mr. B?</i>

12:08.962 --> 12:10.130
<i>Mr. B?</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:12.432
 <i>-Mr. B.</i>
  -( feedback )

12:12.832 --> 12:14.868
Mylo, it works.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.470
 Why are you yelling?

12:17.504 --> 12:19.773
 If it works,
 why don't you use it?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.079
 -Good morning, Miss Bliss.
 -Good Morning, Mylo.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.148
Too bad you had to kick
out your friend, Tina.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.818
  First her boyfriend did her
  in, now her best friend.
  What a bummer.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.788
 Mylo, I did not kick her out.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.657
I just prefer to
live alone, that's all.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.927
   And why am I
   discussing this
   with you anyway?

12:40.960 --> 12:44.798
Probably because
you don't have Tina
to kick around anymore.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.002
  Excuse me.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.938
  Tina, come on.
  You can't be
  mad at me forever.

12:51.971 --> 12:55.008
  What makes you think I'm mad?
  I'm not mad.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.110
 -Are you okay?
 -Yeah, fine.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.646
 Good. Well, I'm glad.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.415
  I know that if I just stabbed
  my best friend in the back,

13:02.449 --> 13:03.650
   I'd be miserable.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.085
   Have a nice day.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.825
   And so with a camera,
   you can capture a memory.

13:11.858 --> 13:15.662
  But I don't quite understand.
  Wouldn't a painting
  do the same thing?

13:15.695 --> 13:19.165
  Well, I'm glad you brought
  that up. You see,
  the proof is in the picture.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.167
   Jennifer, if you please.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.506
 -Yuck.
 -Way to go, Screech!

13:26.539 --> 13:27.607
 Hey, Zack, it worked!

13:27.640 --> 13:28.942
Never doubt the master.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.778
  -I want that picture.
  -Never.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.915
  Now, Samuel.
  So far your project
  has earned you a B.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.818
 Is keeping that
 picture worth a lower grade?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.487
  Absolutely.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.958
   Hold it, hold it.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.927
  Now, tomorrow's presentations
  are from Amanda and Jeremy,

13:47.961 --> 13:50.497
  Lisa and Mikey
  and Zack and Nikki.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.099
  Okay, go discover America.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.901
 Did you feel anything at all?

13:54.934 --> 13:58.838
  -Words can't describe it.
  -Yeah,
  I felt the same thing too.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.075
 Miss Bliss, we need to talk.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.209
  What's the problem?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.679
   I'm standing next to it.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.715
Well the view's not so
great from here either.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.817
 I wanna be perfectly honest.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.053
For the record,
it's all Nikki's fault.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.588
   -My fault?
   -You see, she admits it.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.058
 Now settle down, both of you.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.161
Now I teamed everyone
together for a reason.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.565
  I know sometimes it's
  difficult working together,
  but believe me.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.968
   In life, you have to learn
   to work these things out.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.905
  But I thought if
  anybody would understand,
  you would.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.074
 I mean, look what happened
 with you and Miss Paladrino.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.476
Good point, took the words
right out of my mouth.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.246
 Excuse me,
 I don't think that's
 any of your business.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.284
Don't look at me,
I took the words
right out of her mouth.

14:44.317 --> 14:49.789
 Now listen, either you do this
 project together or I'll have
 to give each of you an F.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.958
These words,
right out of my mouth.

14:57.163 --> 15:01.034
Yes, I'm calling about
the apartment for rent.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.104
 Yeah,
 your ad says it has a garage.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.740
 The apartment is the garage?

15:06.773 --> 15:09.943
   I'll call you back if I
   have to sleep in my car.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.612
  Hi.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.049
  -Is that okay if
  I use your phone?
 -Of course.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.753
 Because, I would hate
 to inconvenience you
 any more than I already have.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.755
It's all right.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.158
Why don't I just go
down to the gas station
and use the pay phone?

15:25.191 --> 15:28.128
   It's still light out.
   I should be safe.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.729
 God willing.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.865
 Tina.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.567
 In class, I tell my students

15:34.601 --> 15:37.237
   that they've got to
   learn to work things out.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.672
 Well,

15:38.705 --> 15:41.307
 why don't we give
 being roommates another try?

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
   What do you say?

15:42.509 --> 15:45.912
I think you're
making this offer
'cause you feel guilty.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
-That's not true.
-Okay,

15:47.981 --> 15:51.818
  then look me in the eye and
  tell me that you're not
  doing this out of guilt.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.087
  I am not doing
  this out of guilt.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.089
 You're looking me in the nose.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.926
 All right, I do feel guilty.

16:00.026 --> 16:04.731
 But, Tina I wish
 you could see this
 from my point of view. I mean,

16:04.764 --> 16:06.599
   I'm on a tight schedule.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.536
  I have to have
  my life organized.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.606
  After all teaching kids,
  saving the whales,
  cleaning the planet

16:13.640 --> 16:16.076
doesn't leave me
very much time.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.112
  -And I'm in the way.
  -I'm sorry.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.748
  But I think we both
  need our own space.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.819
I thought you liked me.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.821
  I thought we were friends.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.856
   I do. And we are.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.891
 Where are you going?

16:31.925 --> 16:34.227
  I'm going to
  find a cheap hovel,

16:34.260 --> 16:37.063
  in a depressed area
  that will have me.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.277
   Mikey and Lisa, that was a
   very well thought-out
   presentation

16:51.311 --> 16:52.679
   on the typewriter.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.314
  -B-plus.
  -All right.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.316
  Stick with me, kid.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.253
  Mikey, I knew you could type
  fast. But I had no idea
  you were that fast.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.857
 ( reading gibberish )

17:03.890 --> 17:05.592
 I think you've misspelled
 ( repeats gibberish )

17:07.160 --> 17:09.729
  Nikki and Zack, you're on.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.366
 -Okay, just don't
 do anything stupid.
 -Hey, it's all yours.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.803
 Okay.

17:18.672 --> 17:21.040
   The year is 1887.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.675
Now this is
a chart of the distance

17:22.709 --> 17:25.244
  the average farmer was
  from his nearest neighbor.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.681
  Now in some cases,
  hundreds of miles.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.950
 Now it can take weeks
 for a letter to travel
 from one place to another...

17:31.051 --> 17:35.355
 Pace yourself, Nikki.
 You don't wanna peak too soon.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.725
  And,
  what if you have an emergency
  and you need a doctor?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.695
   The answer is, my invention.
   The telephone.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.663
-Our invention.
-Right.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.433
  Okay, here's how it works.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.070
   You dial a number on your
   phone and someone
   else's phone rings.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.339
 They answer, you talk.
 It's all in seconds.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.408
   Well I'm sold, does
   this thing come in beige?

17:55.442 --> 17:58.945
This telephone of yours.
How much does it cost?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.848
   Well, it costs about $45.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.851
 I can buy two cows for that.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.619
   Can I get milk
   from your phone?

18:06.653 --> 18:09.122
Well if you call the dairy,
you can.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.025
   I don't think so.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.894
   I'm just a poor farmer,
   I got a lot of
   chores and plowing to do.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.131
 Unless you can change my mind,
 I'm not interested.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.034
   Ring, ring, ring.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.103
  Come on, Zack.
  Aren't things
  bad enough already?

18:23.136 --> 18:25.038
 Can somebody
 answer that, please?

18:29.042 --> 18:32.045
  -Hello.
  -Yeah, hi, is Nikki around?

18:32.045 --> 18:34.347
Tell him I'm not here.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.050
  I think you
  should talk to him.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.318
   ( sighs )

18:38.351 --> 18:40.453
 Hello, hello.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.822
 Look, I know you're there.
 I can hear your
 teeth grinding.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.792
 -What do you want?
 -You never answered my letter.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.060
  Aren't we friends anymore?

18:47.060 --> 18:49.863
 -I think I'm about
 to invent the hang up.
 -What's that?

18:49.896 --> 18:53.700
  You never received my letter?
  Must have gotten lost.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.770
 I'm sure glad I called
 you on the telephone.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.806
  Yeah. Right the telephone.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.909
 -It's a good thing I have one.
 -Right.

19:03.009 --> 19:07.280
 It might cost more, but thanks
 to the phone friends can talk
 things out. Right?

19:09.249 --> 19:12.452
I mean we were friends
since the first grade.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.689
We used to play
little league together,
remember?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.857
 We had a lot of fun!

19:17.891 --> 19:20.026
  Yeah, I know what you mean.

19:21.394 --> 19:25.065
-Well I'm really
glad you called.
-I'm glad I called too.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.839
  So, if not for the phone,
  your friendship
  might have ended.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.142
   Right.
   Instead I think it's
   a little bit better now.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.280
I don't know. I'm still
bothered by one thing.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.184
   This invention of yours,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.953
  can I get a mobile
  phone for my horse?

19:48.421 --> 19:51.091
 Well done both of you.
 A-minus.

19:53.526 --> 19:58.365
-Hey,
thanks for bailing us out.
-What are partners for?

19:58.398 --> 20:00.467
   After school,
   you wanna throw
   the ball around?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.836
 I don't know. I'll call you.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.350
   -Who is it?
   -Bran muffin,
   for Carrie Bliss.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.786
 Bran muffin, for Carrie Bliss.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.324
 Tina.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.193
   You are one of my
   favorite people.
   Do you know that?

20:27.227 --> 20:30.096
I am so sorry, Carrie.

20:30.130 --> 20:34.934
  This is your home and I was
  wrong to bring my
  crazy life into it.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.404
But you are who you are,
and that's who I love.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.073
   -That's who you
   can't live with.
   -Come on.

20:40.106 --> 20:43.176
You didn't exactly like
living with me either,
   did you?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.545
   Well, to tell you the truth.
   I didn't.

20:45.578 --> 20:50.050
 With you, everything
 has to be in its place.
 That drove me crazy.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.421
  You got to be so touchy
  over one little
  broken priceless heirloom.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.388
As a matter of fact...

20:55.422 --> 20:58.558
A simple "no" was really
all I was looking for.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.262
   -Friends?
   -Friends.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.567
-Now I have got
some terrific news.
-What?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.869
   I've rented the guest
   house on the next street.

21:09.903 --> 21:13.106
  It's gonna be great.
  Every morning
  we'll jog together.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.142
 -That's terrific.
 -And we'll have
 our own hot showers.

21:16.176 --> 21:17.844
  -Absolutely.
  -And then,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.480
  I'm gonna make you
  the best breakfast.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.283
   Tina.
   Quit while you are ahead.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.618
Wait a minute.
I make lots of things.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.487
   I made that bran muffin.
