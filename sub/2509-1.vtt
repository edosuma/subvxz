THE PIRATES

02:11.917 --> 02:17.709
WIHWA ISLAND ON THE AMROK RIVER, 1388

02:23.584 --> 02:27.834
We must request rewards and give to our boys, sir

02:28.167 --> 02:30.792
- Joong had a baby and...
- Listen

02:32.584 --> 02:34.251
We'll be the vanguard

02:35.542 --> 02:40.084
Riches and honor are soon ours.
No matter what, trust me

02:42.501 --> 02:44.334
See? We're all set

02:45.751 --> 02:46.959
At dawn...

02:47.209 --> 02:48.626
We will turn back

02:49.042 --> 02:49.876
Yes, sir!

02:50.042 --> 02:53.209
- To overthrow Goryeo...
- What?

02:53.209 --> 02:55.042
We'll attack General CHOE Yeong

02:55.584 --> 02:57.292
ls the vanguard chief ready?

02:57.542 --> 03:01.126
Yes, sir! At your service, sir!

03:02.959 --> 03:04.917
- Isn't this treason?
- I, Yi Seong-gye...

03:05.167 --> 03:08.834
This retreat will be the start of a great history

03:09.084 --> 03:12.251
- With you men I'll...
- Excuse me!

03:14.667 --> 03:16.459
- Quiet!
- It's okay

03:16.626 --> 03:20.042
We're all in this together

03:22.001 --> 03:23.959
Go on and speak

03:28.792 --> 03:31.959
Why aren't we fighting when we're almost there?

03:32.334 --> 03:34.167
You haven't heard?

03:34.459 --> 03:36.459
We'll retreat because first...

03:36.667 --> 03:39.001
It's hard to cross the river in the rain

03:39.209 --> 03:39.792
Okay

03:39.917 --> 03:40.667
Second

03:40.834 --> 03:44.001
The rainy season will rust our arrows

03:44.251 --> 03:44.917
Okay

03:45.126 --> 03:45.834
Third

03:46.042 --> 03:49.501
The supply ship may not come and we'd be stuck

03:50.001 --> 03:51.042
Okay, sir

03:51.376 --> 03:52.251
Fourth

03:52.459 --> 03:56.459
It's not courteous for a small country
to attack a big one

03:56.667 --> 03:57.376
What?

03:57.542 --> 03:59.251
What courtesy in war, sir?

03:59.459 --> 04:02.959
- Then, we can bow and fight!
- Quiet!

04:03.667 --> 04:05.792
It's no place for you to talk!

04:06.084 --> 04:08.084
It doesn't make sense!

04:08.417 --> 04:10.876
We can't fight 'cause of rain, flood,
and bad manners?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.209
So, being a traitor is courteous?

04:13.959 --> 04:21.500
Go back, overthrow the king, and land big posts!

04:21.875 --> 04:23.292
Isn't that it?

04:23.626 --> 04:24.501
Chief MO!

04:24.709 --> 04:26.292
You disappoint me!

04:26.292 --> 04:31.417
Steal the country to be rich?
I'd rather be a bandit!

04:33.417 --> 04:35.209
Sir! Let's go!

04:35.626 --> 04:36.626
Joong! Let's go!

04:36.834 --> 04:38.334
You fool!

04:42.709 --> 04:43.959
Sir!

04:44.542 --> 04:46.876
Don't you want to see your baby?

04:47.834 --> 04:49.917
Don't make me pull out my sword

04:51.376 --> 04:53.001
We're all brothers, sir

05:07.667 --> 05:11.292
Joong! No!

05:12.792 --> 05:14.834
Joong! Wake up!

05:48.834 --> 05:49.917
The sword...

05:50.376 --> 05:52.001
has no courtesy!

06:34.542 --> 06:36.751
Big trouble!

06:37.042 --> 06:38.792
Hurry!

07:34.167 --> 07:35.834
What a waste of a life

07:36.501 --> 07:38.417
- Kill him!
- Yes, sir!

08:41.251 --> 08:42.917
Oh, God! I'm dying!

08:50.459 --> 08:51.709
Damn seasickness...

09:10.959 --> 09:14.042
I'm Captain Soma of the pirates

09:16.667 --> 09:18.876
Where are the Buddha statues?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.709
They're on another ship

09:25.334 --> 09:27.501
They're under the cabin floor!

09:29.417 --> 09:31.417
Buddha have mercy

09:34.001 --> 09:35.167
Yeo-wol

09:35.917 --> 09:39.834
If you let them live, they'll be trouble later

09:41.126 --> 09:42.417
Remember

09:43.917 --> 09:45.334
Take the statues!

09:45.959 --> 09:47.042
Yes, sir!

09:55.001 --> 09:58.209
- Nice!
- Buddha have mercy!

10:12.459 --> 10:14.709
The fools even sold off girls!

10:16.001 --> 10:17.459
Don't be scared

10:18.042 --> 10:19.709
We'll send you home

10:21.376 --> 10:22.459
Sis?

10:23.751 --> 10:25.167
How dare you call the Chief Mate that!

10:25.417 --> 10:26.709
Take me with you!

10:26.917 --> 10:28.584
My father sold me off!

10:31.792 --> 10:33.542
Pirates are at risk to die any day

10:33.792 --> 10:35.251
Same for slaves!

10:35.626 --> 10:37.417
I'll cook, clean, and do anything!

10:38.167 --> 10:41.042
Sounds like she'll earn her keep

10:57.542 --> 10:58.792
Buddha is sinking!

11:22.542 --> 11:25.501
Stupid! Why'd you drop it!

12:15.167 --> 12:17.876
You should've jumped in!

12:19.751 --> 12:21.001
She'll come up!

12:24.376 --> 12:30.126
- She did it!
- Hurray! Chief Mate!

12:44.751 --> 12:47.084
THREE YEARS LATER

12:47.334 --> 12:52.292
Black seas, red seas, white seas...

12:54.542 --> 12:57.626
The seas are not all blue, sir

12:59.751 --> 13:03.959
So, how was sailing around from sea to sea?

13:04.501 --> 13:09.084
Buddha reached the state of
nirvana while travelling

13:09.834 --> 13:12.751
After coming back here to the Yellow Sea...

13:12.917 --> 13:14.917
I came to a realization, too

13:16.501 --> 13:18.584
Seas or metals...

13:19.792 --> 13:21.542
Yellow is the best!

13:30.084 --> 13:33.834
We found some Japs pirating in our turf

13:34.167 --> 13:35.667
You had to be there!

13:36.126 --> 13:38.709
Stop! Aren't you sick of that story?

13:39.167 --> 13:40.084
Then what?

13:40.334 --> 13:45.001
We agreed to a leaders' duel
to avoid further bloodshed

13:45.292 --> 13:48.667
So, we met up by Tsushima Island

13:48.667 --> 13:49.917
Let's just eat!

13:49.917 --> 13:54.792
Yeo-wol went out to face this huge, burly guy

13:55.626 --> 13:58.126
Wait. What was his name?

13:58.126 --> 13:59.251
Makulaki

13:59.251 --> 14:00.834
Right! Makulaki!

14:00.834 --> 14:01.876
But who's Yeo-wol?

14:02.126 --> 14:06.334
She beat him with one blow!
Then, 500 men attacked at once!

14:06.584 --> 14:07.876
5,000 men!

14:08.626 --> 14:09.959
Was it that many?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.751
Well, there were over 500

14:13.126 --> 14:13.876
Anyway!

14:14.126 --> 14:17.667
We fought off 5,000 men for two weeks 'til
the sea turned blood red!

14:17.834 --> 14:20.834
Damn! So what?

14:21.126 --> 14:24.959
We fight like hell, but only the Captain eats meat

14:25.251 --> 14:28.042
All we get is diarrhea from the damn fish!

14:28.167 --> 14:30.542
Don't talk about shit while eating

14:30.542 --> 14:34.126
I heard Captain Soma bought 12 houses

14:34.667 --> 14:36.542
When do we get paid?

14:38.501 --> 14:39.709
That's enough

14:40.209 --> 14:41.876
Like it or not, we're brothers

14:42.792 --> 14:45.042
Why don't you attack him?

14:45.376 --> 14:47.001
You know we all want it

14:47.209 --> 14:49.167
Overthrow him and become the captain!

14:49.167 --> 14:53.251
She's talking like a pirate already!

14:54.167 --> 14:55.501
This is what I think

14:55.751 --> 14:56.834
Who asked you?

14:56.834 --> 15:00.584
A true pirate should...

15:01.209 --> 15:02.792
Damn!

15:05.459 --> 15:07.959
I told you to find another job!

15:08.417 --> 15:11.126
What pirate gets seasick!

15:13.251 --> 15:19.084
Damn seasickness

15:19.084 --> 15:21.584
The order is out to get rid of pirates

15:22.459 --> 15:26.042
If I don't bring back your heads,
they'll have mine!

15:27.001 --> 15:30.334
Of course you should bring in results

15:31.417 --> 15:34.501
Would 7 pirate heads do, sir?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.084
Damn bastard!

15:37.876 --> 15:39.167
He'll have us killed?

15:39.417 --> 15:41.001
They're useless anyway

15:41.167 --> 15:41.834
Wait!

15:41.834 --> 15:43.292
Shall we go look?

15:48.626 --> 15:49.834
- Clamp!
- Yes, sir!

15:49.834 --> 15:51.001
- Thatch!
- Yes, sir!

15:51.292 --> 15:52.501
- Sod!
- Yes, sir!

15:52.751 --> 15:53.584
Crap Sack!

15:53.834 --> 15:54.542
Here, sir!

15:54.751 --> 15:56.251
- Big Eyes!
- Yes, sir!

15:56.542 --> 15:57.251
Sea Horse!

15:57.459 --> 15:58.542
Me?

16:00.001 --> 16:04.834
Damn! I served a rotten captain like that!

16:06.334 --> 16:09.376
And I ain't fit for the sea

16:12.959 --> 16:14.417
Tie them up!

16:17.167 --> 16:17.834
Captain! Let go!

16:17.834 --> 16:18.459
Captain!

16:18.459 --> 16:20.292
You're deserting your brothers?

16:20.584 --> 16:22.876
The streets are filled with fools like them!

16:23.126 --> 16:24.292
What brothers?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.292
Chief Mate! Help! Let go!

16:26.917 --> 16:28.417
This is not the way of a pirate!

16:29.001 --> 16:31.959
You dare try to teach me?

16:32.459 --> 16:33.417
Take them, sir

16:33.417 --> 16:34.667
Captain Soma?

16:35.292 --> 16:37.542
I want to take her, too

16:37.876 --> 16:39.917
Still, she's the Chief Mate

16:40.667 --> 16:43.501
How about the girl behind her instead?

16:46.501 --> 16:47.792
Tie up the girl behind her!

16:47.834 --> 16:49.001
Let go!

16:49.501 --> 16:51.084
Back off! I'm a pirate!

16:51.417 --> 16:53.292
Sis! Chief Mate! Help!

16:54.584 --> 16:55.501
Stop this

16:55.667 --> 16:57.292
Give the rest some liquor and meat!

16:57.584 --> 16:58.376
Let go!

16:58.376 --> 17:00.209
They'll forget after a couple
drinks and some laughs.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.792
Only the strong will...

17:07.251 --> 17:08.626
You bitch!

17:15.541 --> 17:16.709
Captain Soma!

17:17.126 --> 17:18.626
Drop your swords!

17:38.459 --> 17:41.834
So ungrateful, worse than swine

17:42.626 --> 17:44.251
I'll overthrow you

18:32.501 --> 18:35.417
Yes!

18:40.376 --> 18:45.376
Loser! In your dreams!

18:49.167 --> 18:51.417
Considering our time together...

18:51.542 --> 18:54.667
If you surrender, I'll let you live

18:56.501 --> 18:59.126
There are only two ends for a pirate

18:59.334 --> 19:01.459
To become fish food...

19:03.001 --> 19:04.417
Or...

19:14.501 --> 19:16.126
The sea is cold

19:17.376 --> 19:18.876
Throw him a blanket

19:40.084 --> 19:41.792
JOSEON

19:42.001 --> 19:43.084
Joseon!

19:43.417 --> 19:45.417
It is not only a beautiful name...

19:45.667 --> 19:48.709
but it comes from your history

19:48.959 --> 19:50.876
So, it shall be

19:51.376 --> 19:56.376
Also, I am bestowing a new Royal Seal

19:56.667 --> 20:04.001
I command the new country to flourish

20:04.459 --> 20:05.751
Furthermore...

20:05.917 --> 20:15.126
serve me by offering up 500 maids and 200 eunuchs

20:15.667 --> 20:22.376
Yes, Your Gracious Majesty!

20:28.626 --> 20:33.959
With this, Joseon will be founded!

20:35.292 --> 20:38.084
Do you think everything is fine back home?

20:38.542 --> 20:40.584
What if the king changes again?

20:40.584 --> 20:41.584
Why you!

20:41.751 --> 20:43.542
Just worried, that's all

20:43.876 --> 20:45.376
Think about it, sir

20:45.709 --> 20:49.126
They bestowed posts on restless, rich men

20:49.626 --> 20:52.459
But with no country name or the Royal Seal...

20:52.792 --> 20:55.626
They'll think nothing's changed with a new country

20:55.834 --> 20:59.584
You can't rule a country afraid of complaints

21:05.417 --> 21:07.542
- What's that sound?
- We're not sure, sir!

21:11.709 --> 21:13.709
There are pirates here!

21:14.042 --> 21:15.126
Get ready to fight!

21:15.292 --> 21:18.667
- Prepare for battle!
- Yes, sir!

21:22.042 --> 21:23.917
Fire your arrows!

21:37.667 --> 21:38.626
It's a baby whale, sir

21:38.876 --> 21:41.917
How dare it cross this envoy ship's path!

21:43.376 --> 21:44.292
After it!

21:44.709 --> 21:46.501
After it!

22:12.917 --> 22:14.251
Kill it!

22:14.751 --> 22:15.584
Fire the cannons!

22:15.709 --> 22:17.001
Fire the cannons!

22:17.542 --> 22:19.834
Fire the cannons!

22:31.751 --> 22:32.667
There! There!

22:32.876 --> 22:34.667
The baby whale is out!

22:34.917 --> 22:37.501
Cannons! Fire!

22:37.667 --> 22:38.626
Fire!

22:38.876 --> 22:40.084
Fire!

23:14.334 --> 23:16.084
The Royal Seal!

23:16.251 --> 23:18.251
There, sir!

23:38.292 --> 23:39.376
Joseonu.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.542
The Royal Seal...

23:44.959 --> 23:48.001
Crazy Tiger!

23:48.792 --> 23:52.584
Where are you, sir!

23:55.876 --> 24:00.542
How insane is he to be called, 'Crazy Tiger'?

24:02.376 --> 24:04.917
Crazy Tiger!

24:06.292 --> 24:08.251
I'm exhausted

24:10.126 --> 24:12.792
Now I'm getting land sickness?

24:15.626 --> 24:18.751
Still, it's better than the sea

24:22.376 --> 24:23.167
Damn!

24:25.751 --> 24:26.917
What's this!

24:27.126 --> 24:28.001
Help me!

24:36.709 --> 24:38.542
He is Chief Crazy Tiger!

24:45.584 --> 24:48.084
So, you want to be a bandit?

24:48.792 --> 24:50.501
Introduce yourself

24:51.376 --> 24:54.584
My name is Chul-bong, sir

24:55.917 --> 24:59.167
After dozens of battles and decades as a pirate...

24:59.376 --> 25:01.959
Though I was the backbone of pirates
who ruled the seas!

25:02.209 --> 25:04.792
I have my reasons to turn into a bandit

25:05.542 --> 25:11.126
So, use me valuably for I'm a highly capable man

25:11.292 --> 25:12.959
That's it, sir

25:13.417 --> 25:14.626
Okay, fine

25:14.751 --> 25:16.542
Why did such a capable man...

25:18.167 --> 25:20.459
turn his back on the sea?

25:20.917 --> 25:22.001
What?

25:26.001 --> 25:27.417
Because I hate eating fish

25:27.626 --> 25:28.959
I can't stand the smell

25:29.709 --> 25:33.584
- I think I'm a meat person
- Fishy smell!

25:38.126 --> 25:39.501
Were you kicked out?

25:40.167 --> 25:41.417
Kicked out?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.667
No way, sir!

25:45.667 --> 25:46.917
Yeah, you were

25:48.751 --> 25:51.834
No, sir! That's ridiculous!

25:52.334 --> 25:53.709
How dare you!

25:53.959 --> 25:55.376
Tell the truth!

25:57.459 --> 26:00.126
Yes, sir

26:00.751 --> 26:02.709
Okay. I'll tell the truth

26:04.376 --> 26:08.501
I had riches and fame and lacked
nothing as a pirate

26:08.751 --> 26:11.084
But life was just no fun!

26:11.626 --> 26:14.959
I felt this hollow emptiness inside

26:14.959 --> 26:16.584
I couldn't even eat

26:17.459 --> 26:20.334
I wondered why, then realized one day!

26:22.834 --> 26:26.292
A man should be a bandit!

26:26.959 --> 26:28.126
That's it!

26:28.376 --> 26:30.209
A man belongs in the mountains!

26:30.292 --> 26:31.751
That's enough!

26:32.751 --> 26:34.251
You look a little dumb...

26:34.459 --> 26:36.792
but since you've got nowhere to go,
I'll take you in

26:37.376 --> 26:41.542
As 30th in rank, do your job well

26:43.501 --> 26:45.501
Chief! I'm the 30th?

26:45.501 --> 26:48.376
What about all my experience?

26:48.709 --> 26:50.917
Hey, Rookie! Go cook

26:51.292 --> 26:53.501
Young fool! How dare you!

26:53.501 --> 26:54.834
Why you!

27:05.459 --> 27:07.001
What in the world happened?

27:07.209 --> 27:08.501
My friend...

27:08.792 --> 27:10.917
First, have a seat

27:11.376 --> 27:14.501
You fool!

27:14.792 --> 27:16.917
A whale ate the Royal Seal?

27:17.251 --> 27:19.709
You dare mock me!

27:19.959 --> 27:23.417
Behead him at once!

27:23.917 --> 27:24.876
Your Majesty!

27:25.084 --> 27:26.251
Your Majesty...

27:29.334 --> 27:31.209
That's what will happen

27:33.542 --> 27:34.376
You're right

27:34.584 --> 27:37.876
A whale ate the Royal Seal!
It makes no sense, right?

27:37.876 --> 27:40.251
How could you let this happen?

27:41.251 --> 27:44.542
Still, I brought back the name
for our country

27:44.751 --> 27:46.376
What if I lost both of them?

27:46.626 --> 27:50.334
Since you recommended me,
you'll be at fault, too

27:52.542 --> 27:54.126
We'll just die together

27:55.042 --> 27:57.376
I should've died at sea!

28:02.251 --> 28:03.626
Listen carefully

28:04.084 --> 28:05.584
Beware of public sentiment

28:06.001 --> 28:08.292
If people find out about this strange incident...

28:08.501 --> 28:11.542
They'll think fate is against this new kingdom

28:11.876 --> 28:14.334
So, everything I'm about to say...

28:15.876 --> 28:17.667
is for Joseon's good

28:19.126 --> 28:20.626
There was no whale

28:21.167 --> 28:25.542
You were attacked by pirates

28:28.334 --> 28:29.542
Your Majesty!

28:30.001 --> 28:32.084
Put me to death!

28:32.084 --> 28:35.834
What happened to you?

28:36.251 --> 28:38.376
Your Majesty!

28:39.292 --> 28:45.792
While bringing the country's new name
and Royal Seal back...

28:46.584 --> 28:50.667
I was attacked by Goryeo pirates!

28:51.542 --> 28:55.376
They stole the Royal Seal, sir!

28:55.376 --> 28:57.834
The Royal Seal!

28:59.709 --> 29:00.584
Your Majesty...

29:00.584 --> 29:01.376
And yet...

29:01.542 --> 29:02.626
Let go!

29:02.626 --> 29:04.126
You came back alive!

29:04.376 --> 29:06.959
I deserve to die, sir!

29:07.334 --> 29:12.167
But I had to bring back the country's name, sir

29:12.667 --> 29:19.417
We defended it from the ferocious rebels, sir!

29:21.042 --> 29:25.292
He said to call this country "Uoseon"?

29:26.084 --> 29:27.042
Yes, sir

29:27.251 --> 29:28.917
But the Royal Seal...

29:28.917 --> 29:32.501
- Kill me now, sir!
- Kill us!

29:32.501 --> 29:34.417
They must be eradicated, sir!

29:34.834 --> 29:38.126
Goryeo bandits and pirates must be rooted out!

29:38.334 --> 29:39.542
Quiet!

29:39.751 --> 29:41.251
Silent!

29:46.876 --> 29:48.792
Proclaim our new country as Joseon!

29:49.001 --> 29:52.084
Send out troops to root out bandits and pirates!

29:52.584 --> 29:54.042
And find the Royal Seal!

29:54.251 --> 29:55.376
Yes, Your Majesty

29:55.626 --> 29:56.542
As soon as...

29:56.542 --> 29:57.876
Two weeks!

29:58.876 --> 30:00.417
You have two weeks

30:03.084 --> 30:04.126
Understood?

30:04.209 --> 30:06.126
Yes, sir!

30:07.667 --> 30:09.042
I got a great tip

30:09.917 --> 30:14.334
A merchant band is carrying goods
with just 20 guards

30:15.292 --> 30:16.626
When Monk gives the signal...

30:16.792 --> 30:19.792
Buddha have mercy

30:20.042 --> 30:20.584
Rookie!

30:20.584 --> 30:21.501
Yes!

30:22.667 --> 30:23.709
That's you!

30:24.126 --> 30:25.876
Cut the rope to his signal

30:27.126 --> 30:28.917
Then, I will...

30:39.542 --> 30:40.417
Chief?

30:40.584 --> 30:44.042
I fought countless battles.
I should be on the front lines,

30:44.209 --> 30:46.042
Not back here cutting a rope!

30:46.209 --> 30:47.376
Just do your job right

30:47.376 --> 30:49.251
It's the Rookie's job to cut it

30:49.917 --> 30:51.876
I said use me valuably Damn

30:52.209 --> 30:54.876
The blessing is coming

30:56.251 --> 30:58.292
The blessing is here

30:58.501 --> 31:00.084
Get ready, sir!

31:02.042 --> 31:05.376
Buddha's blessing

31:07.126 --> 31:08.501
Make Way!

31:10.709 --> 31:11.834
Not good!

31:12.084 --> 31:13.042
Cut it?

31:13.209 --> 31:13.876
Royal troops!

31:14.042 --> 31:15.042
Cut it now?

31:15.501 --> 31:16.626
Lots of them!

31:19.584 --> 31:20.501
Don't cut it!

31:20.709 --> 31:21.334
Now?

31:21.334 --> 31:22.292
Yes!

31:22.542 --> 31:23.834
Run away!

31:29.626 --> 31:31.459
Son of a bitch!

31:31.709 --> 31:33.251
Run!

31:39.376 --> 31:40.626
What's this?

32:01.917 --> 32:06.167
Charge! Come out! Kill them!

32:20.334 --> 32:21.626
Goryeo rebels! After them!

32:21.834 --> 32:23.126
After them!

32:26.334 --> 32:27.917
We could all get killed!

32:28.334 --> 32:29.917
Scatter out and meet back at the fort!

32:30.126 --> 32:32.042
Scatter out!

32:41.834 --> 32:43.292
Chief!

32:44.001 --> 32:45.167
He's the chief!

32:45.376 --> 32:47.292
Get him!

32:47.876 --> 32:49.792
Wait for me, Chief!

32:53.459 --> 32:54.667
Let's go together!

32:54.792 --> 32:56.417
Get the chief!

32:56.917 --> 32:57.501
Chief!

32:57.709 --> 32:59.876
Go! Get lost!

33:03.167 --> 33:04.001
Chief!

33:04.209 --> 33:05.917
Don't call me, 'Chief'!

33:05.917 --> 33:07.542
Chief! Wait up!

33:08.584 --> 33:09.917
Let's see...

33:10.334 --> 33:12.751
Not many made it back

33:14.126 --> 33:16.834
At this rate, we'll bump into Yl Seong-gye!

33:17.084 --> 33:20.667
I told you not to trust the source

33:20.876 --> 33:26.001
I signaled you to turn back!
What were you thinking?

33:28.667 --> 33:31.001
Why'd we take in that fool!

33:32.417 --> 33:35.167
Better luck next time

33:35.542 --> 33:37.209
We can't succeed every time

33:37.417 --> 33:41.376
Succeeding once would be nice!

33:41.917 --> 33:45.876
We never do! All we eat is dang grass!

33:45.876 --> 33:47.959
Or catch wild boar!

33:51.876 --> 33:53.501
It's all right

33:54.417 --> 33:56.626
We know the royal troops

33:56.834 --> 34:00.959
They'll pretend to chase and run home at sundown

34:02.542 --> 34:03.667
Right, Monk?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.292
Like hell!

34:05.542 --> 34:08.126
Chief! Look!

34:08.376 --> 34:10.001
Seize them!

34:11.126 --> 34:12.917
The sun must not be down

34:13.501 --> 34:15.292
Everyone calm down

34:15.458 --> 34:17.292
Like hell!

34:17.876 --> 34:19.792
Don't the fools sleep?

34:20.417 --> 34:21.167
Chief?

34:22.167 --> 34:23.501
Where'd he go?

34:24.042 --> 34:25.833
Run!

34:31.626 --> 34:33.083
Why'd I come here?

34:49.376 --> 34:50.833
Is he still alive?

34:57.501 --> 34:58.917
Do you want to live?

35:03.626 --> 35:06.334
One of your men tried to harm the king?

35:07.084 --> 35:10.042
Too bad it was before he became king

35:10.459 --> 35:12.584
I just have to catch the whale?

35:14.084 --> 35:16.751
Gut it and bring the Royal Seal

35:18.501 --> 35:22.001
Then, you can have anything in Joseon

35:22.001 --> 35:24.001
But if you fail...

35:25.251 --> 35:27.209
It'll be hell for you

35:28.251 --> 35:32.751
I've already been to hell, sir

35:43.251 --> 35:45.751
You'll command the naval troops

35:47.167 --> 35:51.334
Enjoy and rest up before
heading out early tomorrow

35:54.834 --> 35:57.042
You said it was urgent

36:02.667 --> 36:03.876
Can he be trusted?

36:04.292 --> 36:06.292
I don't trust him,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.459
but I do trust his ambition.

36:19.584 --> 36:21.417
Are you Captain Yeo-wol?

36:21.876 --> 36:26.084
What brings you to the rough seas, sir?

36:26.376 --> 36:27.667
A whale!

36:28.501 --> 36:32.042
It's over 20 meters long and has...

36:33.251 --> 36:35.167
that flag stuck on its back

36:35.542 --> 36:36.542
Bring it to me

36:36.917 --> 36:38.417
I'll do the gutting

36:40.126 --> 36:43.667
I'm not a fisherman I don't catch whales

36:44.001 --> 36:47.209
They're angels of life and death
sent by the Sea God

36:47.667 --> 36:49.709
The Sea God is close with us

36:50.084 --> 36:52.042
You are free to refuse

36:53.084 --> 36:59.584
Then, I'll follow orders to root out pirates

36:59.834 --> 37:04.417
You think it'll be easy to arrest us?

37:04.751 --> 37:06.376
Probably not

37:06.917 --> 37:12.626
But I'll find your families and slaughter them

37:12.667 --> 37:16.959
I'll burn down every village that ever helped you

37:17.167 --> 37:19.251
I'll execute them all!

37:19.667 --> 37:23.876
Hundreds, thousands, until I catch you

37:24.042 --> 37:25.042
That bastard!

37:25.334 --> 37:26.709
Why are you doing this?

37:26.917 --> 37:30.167
Our ships are flat and strong
against the wind, but not fast

37:30.542 --> 37:33.251
Even if we find the whale,
it'll be hard to chase it

37:33.501 --> 37:37.626
But your ship is fast enough to hunt it down

37:38.084 --> 37:39.542
That's the reason

37:40.084 --> 37:41.542
I'll give you 10 days

37:44.376 --> 37:47.084
That one-eyed fool looks like he'll eat us alive!

37:47.501 --> 37:48.417
Attack him!

37:48.417 --> 37:50.001
Stay out of this!

37:50.167 --> 37:52.417
Why! I'm her right-hand-mate!

37:52.834 --> 37:54.376
What will you do?

37:55.959 --> 38:00.459
They're royal troops.
We should do what they ask

38:01.959 --> 38:03.542
How'll we catch a whale?

38:05.334 --> 38:06.834
Let's go to Central Port

38:39.626 --> 38:40.792
That hurts!

38:54.667 --> 38:56.251
Let's go, Monk

38:59.251 --> 39:03.126
- People will think I starve you
- But it's meat!

39:12.209 --> 39:14.709
What's he doing in there?

39:14.834 --> 39:16.959
Let's go! Hurry!

39:18.167 --> 39:21.251
That wanted picture of you looks way better

39:21.792 --> 39:24.751
Stop talking and let's move

39:32.001 --> 39:33.334
Damn thieves!

39:39.876 --> 39:42.001
Don't stop.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.209
Keep rubbing That's it

39:44.459 --> 39:47.584
That's new! I like it!

39:56.834 --> 39:58.334
Captain JANG?

39:58.834 --> 40:02.459
It's been years since I became a bandit

40:02.667 --> 40:04.626
I heard the news

40:05.417 --> 40:08.542
You come across soldiers by chance?

40:09.751 --> 40:10.917
By chance?

40:12.876 --> 40:16.167
You dare sell us off?

40:16.459 --> 40:20.792
Really! It was by chance! Don't you trust me?

40:26.376 --> 40:28.751
I have a brilliant tip to get rich

40:28.751 --> 40:30.792
I'll give it to you for 30 rolls of silk

40:31.042 --> 40:32.542
My patience is running out

40:32.542 --> 40:33.501
20 rolls!

40:33.834 --> 40:34.834
1O rolls!

40:35.084 --> 40:37.584
I'll give it to you for free!

40:39.251 --> 40:40.501
A whale!

40:40.917 --> 40:45.959
It swallowed a big ship full of the Emperor's gold

40:46.334 --> 40:48.792
A fish swallowed it?

40:49.042 --> 40:49.959
That's right!

40:49.959 --> 40:52.126
The whale swallowed it whole!

40:54.834 --> 40:58.334
A fish swallowed an entire ship?

40:58.834 --> 41:00.167
The Royal Seal, too!

41:01.542 --> 41:02.417
What?

41:17.959 --> 41:19.501
Buddha have mercy!

41:19.959 --> 41:21.542
A girl with some nerve

41:22.292 --> 41:24.667
Dare interrupt men doing business?

41:27.417 --> 41:28.959
What men?

41:29.584 --> 41:31.834
All I see are two mutts...

41:33.417 --> 41:35.376
And an old mouse

41:40.501 --> 41:42.209
Such a shame

41:42.667 --> 41:44.459
A beauty with a foul tongue

41:44.459 --> 41:46.001
Who am I talking to?

42:00.292 --> 42:01.959
Let's introduce ourselves.

42:02.626 --> 42:08.667
I'm the infamous Crazy Tiger

42:09.709 --> 42:13.959
I don't know about a tiger,
but you're crazy, all right

42:15.167 --> 42:16.917
Go pick fruits to eat

42:21.459 --> 42:25.834
Stop smiling or I'll cut your face in half!

42:27.251 --> 42:28.667
You a bandit?

42:30.751 --> 42:33.542
Must be hard eating off grass

42:38.292 --> 42:42.209
Buddha have mercy We're outnumbered

42:44.917 --> 42:46.459
This could be yours

42:48.917 --> 42:54.251
I heard new cannons and weapons are brought
in from Europe and Arabia

42:54.667 --> 42:55.459
Why?

42:55.459 --> 42:57.001
You want to catch a whale?

42:57.626 --> 43:04.667
A whale swallowed the Royal Seal sent
by the Emperor of Ming

43:04.667 --> 43:06.792
How blasphemous!

43:07.376 --> 43:08.626
Can you get them?

43:08.917 --> 43:10.667
There's nothing I can't get!

43:11.126 --> 43:16.042
I heard the new country is in total chaos

43:16.167 --> 43:21.542
There's a rumor the king will get rid of Buddhism

43:21.542 --> 43:24.209
Buddha is worth crap these days

43:25.167 --> 43:27.001
You see this as Buddha?

43:27.334 --> 43:30.042
It's just gold in my eyes

43:30.251 --> 43:31.501
Look-

43:33.501 --> 43:38.126
It's not the king who feeds you, but the sea

43:39.209 --> 43:41.001
And we own the sea

43:42.751 --> 43:43.959
Yes, Captain

43:44.876 --> 43:46.501
I want them tomorrow

43:48.042 --> 43:52.501
It was like <i>2</i> or 3 years ago.

43:52.709 --> 44:00.876
We came face to face with 120 naval
ships at open sea!

44:00.876 --> 44:02.751
The rabbit is burning

44:02.751 --> 44:04.417
Did we run? No way!

44:04.751 --> 44:07.917
We pirates never run away!

44:09.459 --> 44:17.792
We fought 5,000 men for <i>2</i> weeks 'til
the sea turned blood red!

44:18.084 --> 44:21.126
That was my 17th pirate battle

44:21.126 --> 44:23.334
The meat is burning!

44:23.959 --> 44:25.501
Damn it!

44:27.292 --> 44:28.126
What!

44:28.292 --> 44:30.376
It's not burned. See?

44:30.584 --> 44:35.376
It's just slightly burned

44:36.376 --> 44:37.917
Who's there?

44:38.209 --> 44:39.084
Who else?

44:39.376 --> 44:40.709
It's me!

44:41.459 --> 44:45.542
You've all struggled enough after following me out

44:46.459 --> 44:52.542
I couldn't even keep my promise
to have liquor on the table

44:53.251 --> 44:54.292
He promised that?

44:54.292 --> 44:55.959
So, I was thinking...

45:01.876 --> 45:03.042
Well...

45:03.292 --> 45:04.584
I get it, Chief

45:04.584 --> 45:06.792
I knew this day would come

45:07.417 --> 45:10.334
I was preparing for this, too

45:10.501 --> 45:12.251
Preparing for what?

45:12.251 --> 45:15.334
You want us to go our separate ways

45:15.334 --> 45:16.126
No

45:16.126 --> 45:18.167
We've been together way too long, you and me

45:18.417 --> 45:20.751
Sit down and listen

45:20.751 --> 45:22.167
Take care, Chief

45:22.376 --> 45:24.126
Let's go

45:25.084 --> 45:27.001
What's with you men?

45:27.001 --> 45:30.292
Where can we apply to become pirates?

45:31.251 --> 45:35.292
There is a ship filled with treasures

45:37.584 --> 45:39.126
Wait! Hold On

45:40.792 --> 45:43.126
What about it?

45:43.167 --> 45:47.042
The Ming Emperor sent a ship filled with jewels

45:47.251 --> 45:49.167
So what?

45:49.334 --> 45:51.001
Must be a big ship, right?

45:51.334 --> 45:54.792
- Of course! It's from the Emperor!
- Right

45:55.167 --> 45:57.042
But that ship...

45:59.834 --> 46:02.209
How can I explain this?

46:02.251 --> 46:04.376
How frustrating!

46:04.626 --> 46:06.459
Tell us now!

46:06.459 --> 46:09.917
A fish swallowed the ship

46:10.917 --> 46:12.376
The hell!

46:13.042 --> 46:14.709
You've been a monk long enough!

46:14.917 --> 46:16.917
Don't you know when to watch your mouth!

46:17.084 --> 46:20.376
How dare you interrupt the Chief with such crap?

46:21.001 --> 46:22.542
A fish swallowed the ship?

46:22.917 --> 46:23.876
Whole?

46:24.167 --> 46:25.251
Whole?

46:25.792 --> 46:27.084
Yeah right!

46:27.084 --> 46:28.584
I'm dying!

46:28.959 --> 46:30.042
Why you!

46:32.417 --> 46:33.876
Go on, Chief

46:34.376 --> 46:35.834
Tell us

46:36.459 --> 46:40.542
What happened to the ship filled with treasure?

46:42.209 --> 46:43.709
The ship...

46:45.876 --> 46:49.001
was swallowed by a fish

46:58.334 --> 47:01.042
The rabbit is all burned!

47:01.167 --> 47:02.751
Why didn't you train him!

47:02.917 --> 47:09.376
I'm surrounded by idiots! I don't believe this!

47:09.667 --> 47:12.542
You're dead! How can you let it burn!

47:12.542 --> 47:13.834
Hold on!

47:14.584 --> 47:17.001
Did they say it was a whale?

47:17.292 --> 47:18.501
A whale?

47:22.459 --> 47:25.584
If it wrecked a ship, it's gotta be

47:25.751 --> 47:26.542
Right!

47:26.542 --> 47:30.126
Yl Seong-gye is going crazy
'cause a whale ate the Royal Seal

47:30.126 --> 47:34.876
So, you're saying we'll get rich
if we just catch the whale?

47:36.001 --> 47:38.126
We could retire for life!

47:40.042 --> 47:41.417
A whale, huh?

47:44.001 --> 47:46.126
Do we catch it with a net?

47:48.251 --> 47:49.459
No way!

47:49.626 --> 47:53.167
Nets won't work at all.

47:53.167 --> 47:54.417
Why?

47:54.751 --> 47:56.584
It's gigantic!

47:57.042 --> 47:59.709
How big can it be?

47:59.959 --> 48:01.501
Just a fish

48:01.792 --> 48:03.209
A fish?

48:05.584 --> 48:08.584
This is how big it is?

48:09.042 --> 48:10.042
Look!

48:10.292 --> 48:13.459
A whale's eye is this big!

48:13.959 --> 48:15.334
You liar!

48:16.126 --> 48:19.876
I'm serious! Its eye is this big!

48:20.626 --> 48:23.376
Then, how big are its teeth?

48:23.542 --> 48:27.042
It doesn't have teeth It eats with its whiskers!

48:28.001 --> 48:29.209
What's so funny?

48:30.501 --> 48:35.376
Cut the nonsense and tell me how to catch it

48:36.501 --> 48:39.501
There's only one way, sir

48:39.876 --> 48:42.209
When it comes up to surface to take a breath...

48:43.626 --> 48:45.376
you fire cannons at it!

48:45.542 --> 48:48.834
A fish that breathes outside the water?

48:48.834 --> 48:50.459
It's true!

48:51.084 --> 48:55.251
It comes up, breathes out, and makes a big splash

48:55.251 --> 48:57.376
Right out of its nose onto its back!

48:57.834 --> 48:59.667
Water gushes up!

49:00.334 --> 49:03.042
The nose is on its back?

49:03.251 --> 49:04.126
Yes!

49:04.876 --> 49:06.584
A monk has his limits!

49:06.626 --> 49:10.542
Next, he'll say a whale even breastfeeds its baby!

49:10.751 --> 49:12.459
That's true!

49:12.584 --> 49:15.667
It even eats seaweed to help with breastfeeding!

49:15.667 --> 49:16.584
I'll kill him!

49:16.584 --> 49:22.126
I give up being a monk!

49:24.917 --> 49:29.584
I don't believe this! How can I explain it?

49:30.167 --> 49:33.251
You country folks don't understand

49:33.792 --> 49:35.417
But the sea...

49:35.917 --> 49:45.084
It's deep and wide and filled
with all sorts of things!

49:45.834 --> 49:50.126
Some of 'em even have lights on the head!

49:50.334 --> 49:55.667
If thousands flash light from their heads...

49:55.792 --> 49:56.876
the sea suddenly lights up!

49:57.167 --> 50:00.584
Light! Dark! Light! Dark!

50:00.709 --> 50:02.417
There's also flying fish!

50:02.709 --> 50:04.751
If thousands of 'em with wings...

50:04.751 --> 50:11.959
jump up from the water, they flap their wings!
Swoosh!

50:12.167 --> 50:13.667
Thousands fly right at you!

50:13.667 --> 50:18.584
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

50:22.626 --> 50:24.709
What a sight!

50:26.792 --> 50:29.126
Hope they're doing well

50:29.584 --> 50:31.667
That just made me hungry

50:33.709 --> 50:34.792
What?

50:35.292 --> 50:36.792
Enough with the jokes

50:37.626 --> 50:39.709
So, we can catch it with a cannon?

50:40.167 --> 50:43.709
No way! You need at least a dozen!

50:47.542 --> 50:49.959
Let's go get cannons!

50:56.251 --> 50:57.667
This one!

50:57.917 --> 51:01.417
It's a portable cannon for easy use

51:01.917 --> 51:02.917
Bang!

51:05.084 --> 51:06.292
And that one!

51:07.001 --> 51:09.834
It's the king of all weapons

51:10.834 --> 51:12.209
It's called Ju-hwa

51:12.501 --> 51:18.834
It can strike a cone from 2,000 steps away!

51:20.876 --> 51:23.376
That one! Yes!

51:24.459 --> 51:27.417
It's called Fog-bomb

51:28.376 --> 51:37.042
If you pop it, thick fog forms
and you won't be able to see

51:42.584 --> 51:46.792
Looks like you have a good eye

51:48.251 --> 51:51.417
It came from Europe

51:51.917 --> 51:54.042
Thousands of miles away

51:54.334 --> 51:58.042
It's called a Grenade Bottle

51:58.417 --> 52:00.959
This is as dangerous as it gets

52:01.167 --> 52:02.501
Step back

52:14.084 --> 52:15.417
Load them up

52:22.001 --> 52:23.334
You scared me!

52:24.126 --> 52:26.959
Country thief asking to die?

52:27.501 --> 52:29.084
Get out of our way!

52:35.501 --> 52:37.001
Are you a pirate?

52:39.084 --> 52:42.084
Must be hard catching fish

52:50.417 --> 52:51.542
Sir!

52:52.251 --> 52:54.167
Where is the wagon?

52:56.501 --> 52:58.792
Crazy Tiger...

52:59.084 --> 53:01.501
- Scatter, then meet up!
- Yes, sir!

53:29.501 --> 53:30.876
Out of the way!

53:34.126 --> 53:35.292
How do you work this?

53:35.292 --> 53:37.001
- You light it! Move!
- Light?

53:37.417 --> 53:38.542
Out of my Way!

53:39.376 --> 53:41.167
Out of my Way!

54:14.001 --> 54:15.834
Stop! Get them!

54:21.792 --> 54:24.959
That Way!

54:40.792 --> 54:46.417
Choon! Run! Faster!

55:11.542 --> 55:13.834
Hello, Lady. I'm...

55:14.001 --> 55:15.417
Crazy Tiger!

55:16.084 --> 55:17.459
Throw her off!

55:17.751 --> 55:19.126
It's heavy!

55:24.084 --> 55:25.042
Iwin!

55:25.292 --> 55:26.334
Look out!

55:33.834 --> 55:35.209
Be careful!

55:53.084 --> 55:54.417
Chief!

56:25.042 --> 56:26.417
I'll have your head!

56:26.792 --> 56:27.792
Calm down, my Lady!

56:27.792 --> 56:30.626
How can I! I almost died 'cause of you!

56:30.917 --> 56:32.167
Why you!

56:32.667 --> 56:33.292
What?

56:33.292 --> 56:35.626
Behind you

56:43.042 --> 56:44.459
Fire!

57:01.167 --> 57:02.459
Are you dead?

57:03.001 --> 57:05.959
Ow! That stings!

57:06.167 --> 57:09.751
Why don't we surrender and hope for the best?

57:10.667 --> 57:12.084
Beg for our lives?

57:12.751 --> 57:14.501
A pirate never...

57:45.542 --> 57:47.126
What the!

57:48.417 --> 57:50.251
Buddha have mercy

58:12.334 --> 58:14.376
JANG Sa-jung...

58:17.959 --> 58:19.709
So foolish

58:20.626 --> 58:23.792
If you get hit in the head, you'll croak!

58:25.001 --> 58:26.834
How dare you say that?

58:28.626 --> 58:30.292
It's the truth!

58:40.167 --> 58:42.376
Are you all ready?

58:42.626 --> 58:43.292
Yes, sir!

58:43.542 --> 58:45.667
Let's go! To the sea!

59:01.001 --> 59:04.876
Fill the cannons by half to put in harpoons

59:05.834 --> 59:08.084
Reduce the hole by two-thirds

59:23.001 --> 59:26.834
We'll avoid the currents and sail out to sea

59:27.626 --> 59:29.292
Raise the sail!

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:39.209
Though we lived as bandits...

01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:42.917
we weren't cowardly robbers like Yl Seong-gye

01:00:43.292 --> 01:00:45.459
He took the country by force

01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:49.959
But he'll have to pay to
get the Royal Seal from us!

01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:51.917
In that sea...

01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:55.334
...is a whale that'll make us rich.

01:00:57.209 --> 01:00:58.542
Let's go out to sea!

01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:01.542
Let's go!

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:03.667
Aren't you coming?

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:06.751
How can we catch a whale in this!

01:01:06.751 --> 01:01:09.626
- Let's just go!
- Stop hitting me!

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:30.834
Your Majesty!

01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:35.292
Since we have declared Joseon our new country...

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.542
How about moving the capital?

01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:42.251
No one builds a house on a grave, sir

01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:47.376
How can the king's palace stand
on Goryeds grave?

01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:49.001
He is right, sir

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:53.126
This place is lurking with Goryeo subjects

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:58.667
We should build a new capital
for Joseon and move, sir

01:02:00.876 --> 01:02:04.334
It is only right to do so

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:10.334
But I won't go to the new capital
without the Royal Seal!

01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:14.292
You have 5 days left

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:19.501
Damn! It didn't work

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:23.542
I thought it would buy us more time

01:02:24.917 --> 01:02:27.959
- We just have to trust in MO
- Right

01:02:28.876 --> 01:02:31.584
Because of rooting out Goryeo rebels...

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:34.417
the country reeks with blood!

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:39.084
And we're also catching kids to
offer as maids and eunuchs

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:47.376
Maybe we don't have to catch the whale to...

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:51.084
One of my men used to talk a lot like you

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:55.251
I had to pull my sword on him

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:01.042
Keep talking

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:04.209
No, sir

01:03:04.709 --> 01:03:08.834
I'll finish loading up the ships
with water and supplies

01:03:45.834 --> 01:03:48.126
Everything's ready, sir

01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:52.959
We've loaded up over 300 cannons, sir

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:57.251
At last!

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.292
I'll get a taste of the sea!

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:06.167
In two days, you'll have the
fastest ship on earth, sir

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:07.667
We sail out tomorrow

01:04:08.834 --> 01:04:12.501
If we wait longer, Yeo-wol will live another day

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:16.209
Yes, sir

01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:19.876
Yeo-wol...

01:04:20.084 --> 01:04:22.959
The sea did not desert me!

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:41.001
Chief?

01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:42.626
Chief?

01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:45.042
Don't drink that

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:50.084
Drinking sea water will kill you!

01:05:01.417 --> 01:05:02.417
What the!

01:05:02.584 --> 01:05:03.459
It's a whale!

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:04.792
Where?

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:10.709
That's not a whale! It's a shark!

01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:15.626
- A great white shark!
- Catch it!

01:05:27.626 --> 01:05:29.542
Help me!

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.792
Bullseye!

01:05:56.959 --> 01:06:00.751
- We caught a whale!
- It's not a whale!

01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:18.292
Yeo-wol is scouring the cost?

01:06:18.834 --> 01:06:20.042
Yes, Captain

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:24.209
It's only a matter of time before we catch her

01:06:24.751 --> 01:06:26.042
Yeo-wol!

01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:28.751
Try running to the ends of the earth!

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:33.376
I have the world's fastest ship...

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:35.959
Did something just pass us?

01:06:36.501 --> 01:06:37.917
It can't be...

01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:39.751
What's that?

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:42.501
That's so fast!

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.501
Cannon! Hurry!

01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:47.751
Where?

01:06:53.084 --> 01:06:56.417
- The shell fell out!
- Wait!

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:57.959
Hurry!

01:06:58.209 --> 01:07:00.626
Choon! Light it up now!

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:01.876
Don't move!

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.167
Hold Still!

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:04.834
Light it now!

01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:07.209
It's lit!

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:11.834
Prepare for battle!

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:13.709
Load the cannons!

01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:16.126
Reload!

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:18.792
Why'd you miss!

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:25.209
Buddha!

01:07:30.209 --> 01:07:30.959
Fire!

01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:32.167
Fire!

01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:44.709
You said this was the fastest ship

01:07:46.209 --> 01:07:48.959
Who? Me?

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.542
It's grown weak

01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.751
Get ready to catch it!

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:20.001
The whale must've gone to heaven.

01:08:22.584 --> 01:08:23.917
Move back!

01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:39.459
Look!

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:43.209
- We caught it!
- We caught a whale!

01:08:45.126 --> 01:08:46.501
We caught a whale!

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.417
No! It's a shark!

01:08:48.626 --> 01:08:50.334
A whale's tail isn't like this!

01:08:51.459 --> 01:08:53.584
Wait! It's still alive!

01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:59.334
It's not a whale?

01:08:59.542 --> 01:09:02.751
How many times did I tell you! It's a shark!

01:09:03.001 --> 01:09:05.334
If a whale was a thick snake...

01:09:05.584 --> 01:09:08.167
a shark would be just a worm!

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:10.292
Why you little!

01:09:10.584 --> 01:09:12.334
Fear makes it seem bigger

01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:14.876
At first, it seemed like a house

01:09:15.334 --> 01:09:19.292
But now I see it's just the size of two cows

01:09:19.917 --> 01:09:21.834
Fix up the boat to sail out again

01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:23.126
What?

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:48.459
- The ship is crushed!
- How do we catch the whale now?

01:09:51.751 --> 01:09:53.334
Aim it carefully!

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:04.667
Let's go catch the whale!

01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:30.917
We're stealing that naval ship?

01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:35.167
You can't sail a ship that big by yourself

01:10:35.376 --> 01:10:39.251
Why steal it when you can't move it?

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:44.626
- I quit. Let me go
- Get lost!

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:46.542
No! You're steering the ship

01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:48.667
I can't steer it alone

01:10:48.876 --> 01:10:50.001
Get the boys to do it

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:52.459
Who'd listen to the last one in the band?

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.542
They always beat me up

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.084
Just let me go

01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:58.792
Why you!

01:10:59.959 --> 01:11:03.751
Chul-bong ranks second from now on

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:06.251
But Chief!

01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:10.417
Well...

01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:15.126
If you need me that much, Chief...

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:17.334
I'll try my best

01:11:17.959 --> 01:11:19.376
Pick your men

01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:22.292
You

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.292
And you!

01:11:27.459 --> 01:11:30.292
Son of a bitch! Young fool always hit me!

01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:32.584
How dare you!

01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:33.626
Chief!

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:35.792
Listen to him

01:11:38.834 --> 01:11:39.792
Listen

01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:43.334
Swimming at sea is different from a lake

01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:45.334
If you try to beat the waves, you'll die!

01:11:45.876 --> 01:11:49.251
Ride 'em smoothly like a snake over rocks

01:11:49.959 --> 01:11:51.001
That's it

01:11:51.292 --> 01:11:54.292
Hold! Breathe out!

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:56.001
Just remember

01:11:56.334 --> 01:11:58.251
You fight it, you're dead!

01:11:58.459 --> 01:12:05.126
At sea, they used to call me 'Shark'

01:12:05.334 --> 01:12:08.584
Listen to me at sea no matter what!

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:10.709
You! Snakehead!

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:15.542
Burn all the other ships with Chief
so they can't follow. Got it?

01:12:16.167 --> 01:12:21.792
Make sure you cooperate
and get things done right!

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:30.084
I'll get the rest of the clan ready to sail out

01:12:31.751 --> 01:12:33.417
Let's live to laugh about this!

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:43.959
I forgot one important thing

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:44.876
Buddha have mercy

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:48.042
There's always oil next to the torch

01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:51.167
All the ships have 'em there

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:54.167
Pour the oil on the other ships

01:12:54.459 --> 01:12:57.001
Then, come back to our ship
and shoot fiery arrows at 'em!

01:12:57.501 --> 01:12:58.626
Got it

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:03.917
Listen carefully! I'm serious here!

01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:08.959
You're all bad, but you're the worst listener!

01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:13.042
Remember and do as I say!

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:26.084
We're ready to sail out, sir

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:31.167
Board all soldiers on the ship!

01:13:32.917 --> 01:13:36.167
Everyone on the ship!

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:46.292
We're in trouble! The troops are coming!

01:13:46.459 --> 01:13:48.626
Naval troops are coming!

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:52.626
What now, Sub-Chief?

01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:55.084
I don't believe this!

01:13:55.626 --> 01:13:58.834
Chief has to come for us to go! Where is he?

01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:19.667
Commander!

01:14:20.376 --> 01:14:22.584
There! Look!

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.834
We're under attack!

01:14:56.834 --> 01:14:58.542
Chief is coming!

01:14:58.542 --> 01:14:59.459
Get ready to sail!

01:14:59.626 --> 01:15:00.376
Hurry!

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:01.876
Monk! Drop the sails!

01:15:02.001 --> 01:15:03.709
You! Cut the rope!

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:05.042
Hurry!

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.376
Cut it?

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:09.792
Who's there!

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:13.751
Hurry!

01:15:18.584 --> 01:15:20.834
Don't come up! Go back!

01:15:31.334 --> 01:15:32.459
Chief!

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:51.834
Get on! Hurry!

01:15:52.834 --> 01:15:54.084
Move!

01:16:10.126 --> 01:16:12.209
JANG Sa-jung!

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:22.001
MO Heung-gap!

01:16:22.876 --> 01:16:24.917
I never thought this day would come!

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:27.084
Chief! Hurry!

01:16:27.376 --> 01:16:29.042
You're still alive?

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.917
You left your post for this?

01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:35.251
I'll send you to hell!

01:16:36.501 --> 01:16:38.126
Shut up!

01:16:55.584 --> 01:16:59.209
So, did you go out and change the world?

01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:01.584
I have no interest in that!

01:17:13.084 --> 01:17:15.001
Chief!

01:17:15.209 --> 01:17:16.167
Get on now!

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:18.417
Hurry!

01:17:25.376 --> 01:17:26.876
Chief!

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:29.417
Grab the rope!

01:17:29.626 --> 01:17:32.334
Pull! Pull!

01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:35.251
Damn!

01:17:38.959 --> 01:17:41.334
I'll be back for your head!

01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:55.209
How many ships left?

01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:57.459
A few small ones, sir

01:18:03.084 --> 01:18:05.001
Send them all out to catch the whale!

01:18:05.501 --> 01:18:07.042
The whale isn't the problem!

01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:09.209
With all the naval ships wrecked like that...

01:18:09.459 --> 01:18:11.542
How can we expect to live?

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:13.542
Listen carefully

01:18:13.876 --> 01:18:17.792
We'll say pirates who stole
the Royal Seal attacked us, too

01:18:18.876 --> 01:18:23.042
Though we lost our ships,
we fought off the pirates

01:18:23.459 --> 01:18:25.834
And recovered the Royal Seal. Understood?

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:32.667
We may find the Seal, but what pirates, sir?

01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:40.292
We'll make them up

01:18:51.751 --> 01:18:53.459
This is a pirate village!

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.167
Treat them like pirates and kill them all!

01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:04.042
Mommy!

01:19:20.959 --> 01:19:26.126
Flats with seaweed in between.
The whale must be roaming here

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:41.626
Whale!

01:19:42.376 --> 01:19:44.417
The one with the flag stuck on it!

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:52.251
The flag is really on there!

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:56.126
- Get the harpoons!
- Yes, sir!

01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:00.834
We're ready!

01:20:14.084 --> 01:20:15.834
Captain? The order?

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:20.167
Why are you hesitating?

01:20:20.667 --> 01:20:22.001
It's a baby whale

01:20:26.126 --> 01:20:28.501
How old does it look?

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:30.167
Huh?

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:33.709
I must be going blind

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:36.834
Can't you see? It's a newborn!

01:20:37.459 --> 01:20:38.834
Everyone's tired

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.834
We can't exchange a whale's life
for people's lives

01:20:42.542 --> 01:20:43.792
Captain!

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:46.001
Should I give the order?

01:20:49.876 --> 01:20:51.001
No

01:20:51.376 --> 01:20:52.667
Aim at it

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.084
Ready to fire!

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.001
Who are those bastards!

01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:23.417
What's on your mind?

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.501
Out in this vast ocean...

01:21:32.126 --> 01:21:34.626
a man can stretch without limits

01:21:36.334 --> 01:21:38.876
Looks like the sea suits us

01:21:39.917 --> 01:21:42.876
The ship's big, so no one's seasick

01:21:45.584 --> 01:21:46.709
Hey!

01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:49.459
Raise the sail!

01:21:49.459 --> 01:21:50.417
What's that?

01:21:50.792 --> 01:21:53.542
What you're holding! Stupid!

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:57.709
- If he's a pirate, I'm Buddha!
- No! Tie it there!

01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:59.959
Let's learn quickly and kill him!

01:21:59.959 --> 01:22:02.292
How can he be second in rank?

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.334
- Buddha have mercy
- What's the racket?

01:22:04.584 --> 01:22:06.251
Chief! Wait!

01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:07.292
Just a second

01:22:07.417 --> 01:22:08.959
I don't get it

01:22:09.251 --> 01:22:12.417
There are many whales in this vast sea

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:16.376
How will you catch the one who ate the Royal Seal?

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:26.501
We'll keep catching whales until
we get the right one

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:30.501
Yeah! You said it's huge!

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:32.834
- How many can there be?
- Just one!

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:37.834
Stupid ignorant bandits!

01:22:38.042 --> 01:22:39.584
Whales aren't minnows!

01:22:40.542 --> 01:22:45.042
Can't catch and gut 'em!

01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:04.501
What a beauty!

01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:09.001
You finally got to see it That's a whale!

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:19.917
Its nose is one its back!

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:22.292
I told you it was there!

01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:29.584
Must be a female It's kind of small

01:23:29.584 --> 01:23:31.334
That's small?

01:23:32.126 --> 01:23:34.334
There are bigger ones?

01:23:34.834 --> 01:23:38.667
Of course! His thingy is this thick!

01:23:40.917 --> 01:23:41.876
What thingy?

01:23:42.042 --> 01:23:43.292
Whiskers

01:23:43.459 --> 01:23:45.084
They're this thick

01:23:45.792 --> 01:23:47.542
Aren't you going to catch it?

01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:49.292
Catch that?

01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:50.501
You said it's a fish

01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:51.917
Just a fish

01:23:52.126 --> 01:23:53.792
Catch it to eat for dinner

01:23:53.917 --> 01:23:57.001
Gut it and cut its fins...

01:23:59.126 --> 01:24:00.084
You fool!

01:24:00.084 --> 01:24:00.709
What's wrong?

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:04.001
If it was that big, you should've stopped us!

01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:06.334
Why bring us out to sea!

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:08.084
Damn it!

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:11.001
I said it was huge a thousand times!

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:12.751
Rank him 10th!

01:24:12.959 --> 01:24:14.417
The last of us!

01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:17.834
You big-mouthed fool!

01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:20.834
Should've drawn the whale's eye bigger!

01:24:33.917 --> 01:24:36.584
I said if you let 'em live, they'd be trouble!

01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:39.292
You became a mere fisherman?

01:24:39.626 --> 01:24:41.917
Putting harpoons on cannons?

01:24:42.126 --> 01:24:43.417
How is it?

01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:46.542
The smell of the sea before you die?

01:24:47.876 --> 01:24:50.042
The sea smells the same

01:24:50.459 --> 01:24:53.292
Get him! You even beat 5,000 men!

01:24:53.626 --> 01:24:55.501
5,000 is an exaggeration

01:24:56.334 --> 01:24:57.667
Let's fight to the death!

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.334
We've lived long enough!

01:24:59.709 --> 01:25:02.084
- You're going blind anyway
- What?

01:25:02.376 --> 01:25:03.667
Don't be foolish!

01:25:04.209 --> 01:25:06.751
There's no way to stop a cannon

01:25:11.084 --> 01:25:12.209
Soma!

01:25:12.959 --> 01:25:14.459
This is between you and me!

01:25:15.084 --> 01:25:17.001
I challenge you to a duel!

01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:19.584
Naive girl!

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:22.959
That's why you're not fit to be a captain!

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:24.459
Boys!

01:25:24.959 --> 01:25:26.126
Bring the ship up close

01:25:26.376 --> 01:25:27.542
Captain?

01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:29.084
There's a ship

01:25:29.376 --> 01:25:30.751
It's a naval ship!

01:25:34.292 --> 01:25:36.292
A man should eat meat!

01:25:37.084 --> 01:25:39.084
- Who needs fish?
- Right!

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.751
We're fit for the mountains

01:25:40.959 --> 01:25:45.167
- Forget the damn fishy-smelling pirates!
- Right!

01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:49.459
Men are like mountains! Women are like the sea!

01:25:50.126 --> 01:25:52.876
Buddha likes mountains, too

01:25:54.584 --> 01:25:59.542
How stupid for pirates to float on
a ship instead of the vast land?

01:26:00.084 --> 01:26:03.042
That's why they're the dumbest of all thieves!

01:26:03.209 --> 01:26:04.834
Right!

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:08.042
Let's go back!

01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:11.292
Buddha! Here we come!

01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:25.042
MY Lady! It's me!

01:26:25.751 --> 01:26:27.751
Damn Crazy Tiger!

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.251
It's me!

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.959
That ship is blocking the cannons.

01:26:33.626 --> 01:26:35.001
Chief?

01:26:35.917 --> 01:26:38.042
We're in a weird spot here

01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:39.501
Now!

01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:42.376
Attack!

01:27:00.167 --> 01:27:01.209
Fight!

01:27:01.501 --> 01:27:02.834
Against who?

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:05.459
Get them!

01:27:07.459 --> 01:27:08.751
Attack!

01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:18.376
I came to help you!

01:27:27.126 --> 01:27:28.667
My Lady! Help!

01:27:28.917 --> 01:27:29.876
Who are you?

01:27:30.084 --> 01:27:31.709
I'm Crazy...

01:27:43.167 --> 01:27:44.251
Damn it!

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:48.751
This isn't our fight! Let's go!

01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:50.626
Let them fight it out!

01:27:52.959 --> 01:27:55.667
Don't fight! Please!

01:27:56.751 --> 01:27:58.834
Just cut his arm!

01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:04.042
Killing is bad

01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:07.959
Wait!

01:28:08.376 --> 01:28:09.376
Chief!

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.584
We're drifting apart!

01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:13.917
Chief!

01:28:30.584 --> 01:28:32.626
You've lasted long enough

01:28:33.126 --> 01:28:35.959
Captain Soma won!

01:28:55.209 --> 01:28:57.334
Congratulations, sir!

01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:01.626
Who are you?

01:29:01.876 --> 01:29:04.792
I'm Crazy Tiger, JANG Sa-jung

01:29:05.167 --> 01:29:06.334
JANG Sa-jung?

01:29:07.834 --> 01:29:08.751
That's right

01:29:09.417 --> 01:29:12.084
It's not easy to meet like this

01:29:12.626 --> 01:29:15.959
How about becoming brothers for life?

01:29:17.001 --> 01:29:19.084
Yes, sir!

01:29:23.334 --> 01:29:24.584
Sir?

01:29:28.751 --> 01:29:34.917
They'll be sent to the naval troops and executed!

01:29:37.334 --> 01:29:40.876
That's what you pay for challenging me!

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:46.001
You abandoned your brothers and got tossed out...

01:29:46.876 --> 01:29:48.959
And haven't changed one bit

01:29:49.126 --> 01:29:52.876
After everything I taught you,
you're still hung up on brotherhood?

01:29:54.251 --> 01:29:57.751
Naive fools fall victim to those with power

01:29:58.376 --> 01:29:59.917
So true, sir!

01:30:01.251 --> 01:30:05.001
As you can see, we're just passing travelers

01:30:05.459 --> 01:30:06.834
We just came the wrong way

01:30:07.167 --> 01:30:12.167
Don't you know it's rude for a bandit to attack a pirate?

01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:15.667
If you say so...

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:20.334
Spare us, sir

01:30:20.667 --> 01:30:24.126
You're cute, the way you beg

01:30:26.042 --> 01:30:27.792
Beg like him, bitch!

01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:29.667
Did you forget?

01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:33.459
There are only two ends for a pirate

01:30:34.084 --> 01:30:35.792
To become fish food...

01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:39.042
Or be resurrected as a dragon!

01:30:41.667 --> 01:30:43.417
There are two ways for bandits, too!

01:30:44.084 --> 01:30:45.376
Go after money

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:47.334
Or...

01:30:47.334 --> 01:30:48.917
Stay alive all of you!

01:30:50.417 --> 01:30:52.417
Wait! I'm not ready!

01:30:54.876 --> 01:30:58.167
Chief! Captain!

01:32:26.751 --> 01:32:28.417
Soma at your service, sir

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:35.876
Explain what happened to Yeo-wol

01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:39.584
I heard she changed cannons with harpoons

01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:43.584
She was chasing whales like a fisherman, Commander

01:32:44.417 --> 01:32:49.001
Right before she caught it,
I turned her into whale bait

01:32:52.167 --> 01:32:54.751
I'll offer you tributes-twice as much as before

01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.834
How much is your life worth?

01:32:58.876 --> 01:33:00.626
Since I rule the seas...

01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:02.459
The price of a whale

01:33:02.792 --> 01:33:06.584
If you catch it, you'll live If you don't, you'll die

01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:09.584
A whale, sir?

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.459
I'm taking over this ship

01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:15.834
You catch the whale and I'll gut it. Got it?

01:33:19.584 --> 01:33:22.334
You're free to board my ship, Commander

01:33:22.876 --> 01:33:25.001
But please remember this-

01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:26.084
What?

01:33:26.292 --> 01:33:28.459
The one who gives orders here...

01:33:29.334 --> 01:33:31.126
can only be me, Soma

01:33:31.876 --> 01:33:33.001
Commander

01:35:35.876 --> 01:35:37.334
Damn...

01:35:39.459 --> 01:35:41.167
Who are you?

01:35:41.417 --> 01:35:43.251
A pirate or a bandit?

01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:46.334
Why's that important at a time like this?

01:35:46.459 --> 01:35:47.792
Who cares!

01:35:47.959 --> 01:35:48.709
Fool!

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:51.709
Pirates are way above petty bandit thieves

01:35:52.334 --> 01:35:55.334
What a load of crap!

01:35:56.126 --> 01:35:59.626
Didn't your leader lose the swordfight?

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:03.626
At least she didn't grovel for her life like yours did!

01:36:03.876 --> 01:36:04.667
He did not!

01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:08.834
He's a great thief who once fought
with Yl Seong-gye!

01:36:08.834 --> 01:36:09.667
Right!

01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:11.001
Yl Seong-gye...

01:36:13.917 --> 01:36:14.584
Who's that?

01:36:14.584 --> 01:36:16.459
Ignorant pirates!

01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:18.584
That's the king's name

01:36:19.001 --> 01:36:20.501
Pirates don't serve kings!

01:36:20.792 --> 01:36:23.751
Only Captain Yeo-wol, daughter of the dragon!

01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:24.667
A dragon's daughter?

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:25.709
The eldest at that!

01:36:25.959 --> 01:36:28.959
Our chief is a tiger's father!

01:36:29.167 --> 01:36:30.792
- The eldest one!
- Right!

01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:32.042
Damn!

01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:33.459
Come here!

01:36:33.459 --> 01:36:34.959
Don't mix with petty bandits!

01:36:35.167 --> 01:36:35.792
Come here!

01:36:35.792 --> 01:36:37.751
Don't mix with loser pirates!

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.459
Why am I so important all of a sudden?

01:36:40.667 --> 01:36:42.001
I don't care!

01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:43.792
Mountains are for men!

01:36:43.792 --> 01:36:45.501
The sea is for men!

01:36:45.626 --> 01:36:49.751
So, why's your leader a girl?

01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:51.042
A girl?

01:36:51.334 --> 01:36:54.709
- You grass-eating fool!
- You anchovy crap!

01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:56.501
Cut it out!

01:36:57.001 --> 01:36:58.584
Why, you!

01:37:47.584 --> 01:37:48.709
Hey!

01:37:53.584 --> 01:37:55.626
You're not sleeping, are you?

01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:15.084
My Lady...

01:38:15.084 --> 01:38:16.584
Shall we go pee?

01:38:18.501 --> 01:38:20.167
Stop being so disgusting

01:38:21.792 --> 01:38:24.042
How is peeing disgusting?

01:38:24.501 --> 01:38:26.042
It's only natural

01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:32.209
I gotta go real bad!

01:38:35.084 --> 01:38:38.334
Cutting off your wrist will solve this

01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:12.209
Your Majesty!

01:39:12.501 --> 01:39:14.959
Goryeo revered Buddhism

01:39:15.376 --> 01:39:18.876
Monks conspired with aristocrats to rule locally

01:39:19.459 --> 01:39:22.001
Revere Confucianism, oppress Buddhism...

01:39:22.292 --> 01:39:26.001
and redirect the riches into the palace, sir

01:39:26.584 --> 01:39:30.959
Thus, establish a firm basis to your kingdom, sir!

01:39:31.292 --> 01:39:36.376
But I have no Royal Seal to stamp such a decree!

01:39:36.626 --> 01:39:38.334
I'm afraid to say this, but...

01:39:38.334 --> 01:39:40.626
If you're afraid, don't speak!

01:39:41.459 --> 01:39:42.417
Two days!

01:39:42.626 --> 01:39:44.001
Just two days left

01:39:46.084 --> 01:39:49.334
Why do they bring up things instead of
finding the Royal Seal?

01:39:52.084 --> 01:39:56.917
Whales stay on the same migratory routes

01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:59.667
Two days are enough to catch it

01:40:00.251 --> 01:40:01.792
I heard it's really big

01:40:03.334 --> 01:40:04.751
Won't it be hard?

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.626
We'll attack the baby whale, sir

01:40:10.042 --> 01:40:14.417
The mother whale never leaves the baby. It'll be easy

01:40:16.459 --> 01:40:19.167
What will you do with her?

01:40:19.584 --> 01:40:22.542
Whales are angels sent by the Sea God

01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:26.251
Catching one would anger the Sea God

01:40:27.959 --> 01:40:31.917
Too bad for you, but she'll be sacrificed

01:40:36.251 --> 01:40:39.917
If you came to me then, you wouldn't be here

01:40:42.292 --> 01:40:44.626
I should've killed you then

01:40:45.542 --> 01:40:47.709
Daring bitch

01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:11.376
What's that?

01:41:14.459 --> 01:41:15.917
My mom gave it to me

01:41:16.376 --> 01:41:18.084
She said it was all she had

01:41:20.084 --> 01:41:21.209
Where is she?

01:41:22.626 --> 01:41:24.084
She died

01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:25.834
Soldiers killed her

01:41:26.126 --> 01:41:27.292
Why?

01:41:28.501 --> 01:41:30.209
'Cause my father was a pirate

01:41:31.626 --> 01:41:33.251
But morn was a fish diver

01:41:33.959 --> 01:41:37.126
So, I can't stand soldiers like you

01:41:39.001 --> 01:41:41.876
It's been years since I became a bandit

01:41:44.001 --> 01:41:47.126
Did you commit a crime?

01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:54.917
I did

01:41:55.501 --> 01:41:58.626
I failed to protect my brothers and country

01:42:02.334 --> 01:42:04.667
Do we have a country to protect?

01:42:05.334 --> 01:42:09.459
Kings and aristocrats run off first
when enemies attack

01:42:10.042 --> 01:42:12.709
They offer children as maids and eunuchs

01:42:12.917 --> 01:42:15.751
They choke the people for more taxes

01:42:16.959 --> 01:42:19.501
Rather than defending a country like that...

01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:23.209
I'd give my life to protect someone I love

01:42:28.501 --> 01:42:30.334
I agree with you

01:42:31.584 --> 01:42:34.417
That's why I want to catch the whale

01:42:35.001 --> 01:42:36.626
I can't live in hiding forever

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:40.209
I want a happy life with a family

01:42:42.376 --> 01:42:43.834
Are you married?

01:42:46.584 --> 01:42:47.709
I'm a bachelor!

01:42:48.459 --> 01:42:51.001
See? We have unbreakable ties like this

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:57.584
You're really asking for it!

01:43:05.542 --> 01:43:07.292
I'm not joking, my Lady

01:43:09.126 --> 01:43:12.501
Won't you be that special person in my life?

01:43:18.542 --> 01:43:20.834
Your face turned red

01:43:21.584 --> 01:43:23.334
It's from the fire!

01:43:24.251 --> 01:43:25.917
Let's go for a swim

01:43:28.084 --> 01:43:29.542
Is it urgent?

01:43:30.126 --> 01:43:31.292
Let's go

01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:41.167
Wonder why the sea is warm

01:43:42.459 --> 01:43:45.667
A petty thief dares mock a pirate captain?

01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.459
A petty thief?

01:43:48.084 --> 01:43:52.376
There are 20 silver coins on my head

01:43:53.584 --> 01:43:56.459
There are 50 on mine! Twice as many

01:43:57.876 --> 01:44:01.292
The reward money isn't important!

01:44:02.126 --> 01:44:03.376
Look!

01:44:03.917 --> 01:44:06.292
It's from killing a powerful Yuan general!

01:44:06.834 --> 01:44:09.917
This is from killing a Vietnamese pirate head!

01:44:10.126 --> 01:44:12.667
I killed 500 Ming soldiers by myself!

01:44:14.292 --> 01:44:17.959
I fought off 5,000 pirates by Tsusima Island!

01:44:20.334 --> 01:44:23.584
I even survived an attack from a tiger! See?

01:44:23.959 --> 01:44:25.709
Ever heard of a dragon?

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.501
What do you know about dragons!

01:44:27.917 --> 01:44:29.709
A dragon bit me, but...

01:44:31.167 --> 01:44:32.459
Shocked?

01:44:32.917 --> 01:44:34.917
Look!

01:44:37.167 --> 01:44:40.251
Why am I all alone...

01:44:45.001 --> 01:44:47.709
I thought I was a goner!

01:44:48.042 --> 01:44:51.209
What happened to the rest?

01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:03.917
Goryeo rebels BANG, YEO, KWAK...

01:45:04.209 --> 01:45:05.626
And the rest of you!

01:45:06.126 --> 01:45:08.042
So damn unlucky!

01:45:10.209 --> 01:45:12.334
After the mountains and the seas...

01:45:12.459 --> 01:45:14.667
I end up dying like this?

01:45:17.459 --> 01:45:19.292
"When we should unite...

01:45:19.792 --> 01:45:21.876
and work hard..."

01:45:23.626 --> 01:45:25.167
Why's this so long?

01:45:26.959 --> 01:45:28.667
"To create new history in this land..."

01:45:29.042 --> 01:45:30.417
Chief?

01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:33.792
Who's that?

01:45:36.459 --> 01:45:37.709
Who are you?

01:45:39.042 --> 01:45:40.251
Who's asking?

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:41.251
"Who's asking?"

01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:42.376
What's it to you?

01:45:42.751 --> 01:45:44.042
"What's it to you?"

01:45:45.084 --> 01:45:45.876
Quiet

01:45:46.042 --> 01:45:46.834
Why!

01:45:46.834 --> 01:45:47.501
IIWhy?"

01:45:47.501 --> 01:45:48.959
So what?

01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:53.167
"So What?"

01:45:53.167 --> 01:45:54.584
- Quiet!
- No!

01:45:54.876 --> 01:45:57.626
I just said my legs hurt! What's wrong with that!

01:45:57.876 --> 01:46:02.459
I'm sitting on a big bump! It kills!

01:46:02.626 --> 01:46:04.417
Just kill me! I gotta pee!

01:46:04.417 --> 01:46:05.917
I apologize on his behalf

01:46:06.084 --> 01:46:08.709
Don't! Can't I say it hurts?

01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:10.834
- Quiet!
- You be quiet!

01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:14.459
Chief

01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:15.959
What? Thief?

01:46:16.126 --> 01:46:17.084
Chief

01:46:17.459 --> 01:46:19.292
They've lost their minds!

01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:20.626
Soldiers!

01:46:20.876 --> 01:46:24.251
- Kill the rebels at once!
- Yes, sir!

01:46:38.751 --> 01:46:41.042
Over here! Captain!

01:46:42.292 --> 01:46:43.042
Chief!

01:46:43.251 --> 01:46:45.959
Over here!

01:46:46.417 --> 01:46:47.667
Chief!

01:46:47.959 --> 01:46:49.042
Captain!

01:46:49.334 --> 01:46:50.584
What about me?

01:46:57.209 --> 01:46:58.001
Stay back!

01:46:58.001 --> 01:46:59.292
Soldiers!

01:47:06.001 --> 01:47:07.542
Where is the girl?

01:47:11.084 --> 01:47:14.126
So, you became a bandit?

01:47:14.542 --> 01:47:16.792
I don't know what to say...

01:47:17.959 --> 01:47:20.209
I ran off without a word

01:47:20.542 --> 01:47:22.709
You'll always be our brother

01:47:23.584 --> 01:47:26.959
No matter where you go, be a good thief

01:47:34.167 --> 01:47:38.584
You'll attack Soma with just them?

01:47:39.584 --> 01:47:45.084
Leave the sea to us and go back to the mountains

01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:47.626
Please reconsider

01:47:48.459 --> 01:47:50.834
Come to the mountains with me

01:47:51.459 --> 01:47:54.292
Let's be happy there

01:47:56.417 --> 01:48:00.667
You're really testing my manners

01:48:03.917 --> 01:48:05.584
Here's my final offer

01:48:07.584 --> 01:48:09.751
If you beg me to stay, I'll stay

01:48:10.459 --> 01:48:13.417
If you beg to come along, I'll take you in

01:48:18.167 --> 01:48:21.292
If you mock a pirate, this is what happens!

01:48:28.042 --> 01:48:29.626
We'll attack Soma!

01:48:31.251 --> 01:48:32.626
And rescue our sister!

01:48:56.459 --> 01:48:57.626
Look

01:48:58.542 --> 01:49:01.709
The color of the sea tells us where the whale is

01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:05.792
The clouds are low We should turn back!

01:49:06.209 --> 01:49:09.376
I said whales are angels sent by the Sea God

01:49:10.334 --> 01:49:12.292
Thought they're easy to catch?

01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:14.376
Yes, sir!

01:49:14.584 --> 01:49:17.542
Come up to the surface

01:49:28.001 --> 01:49:28.959
There!

01:49:29.334 --> 01:49:30.626
It's the whale!

01:49:32.376 --> 01:49:34.251
Full speed portside!

01:49:37.251 --> 01:49:38.876
Mommy!

01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:55.751
It was the naval troops!

01:49:56.459 --> 01:49:59.042
They framed the village as the pirates' hideout

01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:04.209
They killed all the men and took the children

01:50:04.626 --> 01:50:06.667
MO's troops did this?

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:11.709
There's no end to that bastard's greed

01:50:14.167 --> 01:50:16.584
I must kill that devil myself!

01:50:16.667 --> 01:50:17.501
Where?

01:50:17.501 --> 01:50:18.417
Back to the sea!

01:50:18.667 --> 01:50:20.209
Not again!

01:50:21.501 --> 01:50:23.417
Though I can't save the world...

01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:31.001
A man should protect the one he loves

01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:33.792
Then Why'd I get off the ship?

01:50:33.959 --> 01:50:37.084
I come over here and now I'm going back? Damn!

01:50:38.042 --> 01:50:41.042
Chul-bong! You're second in rank

01:50:41.876 --> 01:50:43.126
Let's go, Chief!

01:50:43.834 --> 01:50:46.084
Hurry! Chief!

01:50:46.959 --> 01:50:49.001
Chief! What about me?

01:51:01.834 --> 01:51:03.792
- Stop the ship!
- Go after it!

01:51:03.792 --> 01:51:05.417
- No! Stop!
- After it!

01:51:05.501 --> 01:51:06.542
Commander!

01:51:06.876 --> 01:51:08.292
The whale is getting away!

01:51:08.292 --> 01:51:11.501
Only I give the orders on this ship!

01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:19.292
A baby whale can't hold its breath for long

01:51:20.084 --> 01:51:21.709
It'll come up soon

01:51:22.667 --> 01:51:25.501
- Stop the ship and wait!
- Yes, sir!

01:51:51.501 --> 01:51:53.167
There! It's a whale!

01:51:57.542 --> 01:51:58.501
Turn starboard!

01:51:58.876 --> 01:52:02.292
- Go right!
- Go right!

01:52:05.584 --> 01:52:07.834
Get the baby, not the mother!

01:52:08.417 --> 01:52:11.084
- Aim at the baby!
- Yes, sir!

01:52:11.292 --> 01:52:12.584
Come closer!

01:52:13.917 --> 01:52:15.376
More

01:52:18.751 --> 01:52:19.667
Fire!

01:52:20.292 --> 01:52:21.834
Fire!

01:52:30.292 --> 01:52:32.126
- Pull the rope!
- Yes, sir!

01:52:32.126 --> 01:52:33.542
Lure the mother whale!

01:52:43.209 --> 01:52:44.876
Fire!

01:52:51.542 --> 01:52:53.126
Stop!

01:52:54.626 --> 01:52:56.126
Listen carefully!

01:52:56.584 --> 01:53:00.334
If we don't kill it in one blow, it'll get us!

01:53:01.501 --> 01:53:04.501
- So be on alert!
- Yes, sir!

01:53:11.417 --> 01:53:17.334
Think you can destroy my ship?

01:53:17.959 --> 01:53:19.459
Come closer!

01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:22.084
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:53:26.459 --> 01:53:29.084
Now! Throw the grenades!

01:54:03.084 --> 01:54:04.709
The Sea God!

01:54:04.959 --> 01:54:07.584
A great storm is coming, sir.

01:54:08.126 --> 01:54:11.292
Whales truly are angels from the Sea God

01:54:13.376 --> 01:54:15.667
- Throw the girl in as a sacrifice!
- Yes, sir!

01:54:15.876 --> 01:54:17.876
- Throw the harpoons!
- Yes, sir!

01:54:20.251 --> 01:54:23.876
Let's pull the whale back to land!

01:54:24.167 --> 01:54:26.084
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

01:54:26.334 --> 01:54:27.251
Commander!

01:54:27.251 --> 01:54:29.042
I give the orders here!

01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:34.542
You'll take all the credit, huh?

01:54:35.251 --> 01:54:36.792
You're smarter than I thought

01:54:37.126 --> 01:54:39.042
Oh, much smarter

01:54:40.417 --> 01:54:42.042
- Show 'em!
- Yes, sir!

01:54:45.376 --> 01:54:48.251
If we light the wick linked
to the explosives' den...

01:54:48.751 --> 01:54:52.292
We'll all blow up and become fish food

01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:54.917
Don't forget

01:54:55.626 --> 01:54:58.501
We share the same fate on the same ship

01:54:59.501 --> 01:55:02.209
I'm not going down with you!

01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:04.834
Go ahead and try!

01:55:05.042 --> 01:55:07.126
You don't have the nerve!

01:55:11.084 --> 01:55:13.417
Think you're man enough?

01:55:27.792 --> 01:55:30.917
The dragon is resurrected!

01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:49.751
Sis...

01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:52.084
Let's go home

01:55:53.667 --> 01:55:54.792
Are you okay?

01:55:56.042 --> 01:55:58.542
Guard the whale! Don't lose it!

01:56:24.834 --> 01:56:26.167
No!

01:56:52.501 --> 01:56:54.459
This bitch's life is mine

01:56:54.917 --> 01:56:57.209
A soldier can't kill a pirate like her!

01:57:23.001 --> 01:57:23.667
Fire!

01:57:23.834 --> 01:57:25.251
Fire!

01:57:28.251 --> 01:57:29.584
Sis!

01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:12.584
There are only two ways for a bandit!

01:58:13.251 --> 01:58:14.709
Go after money!

01:58:15.542 --> 01:58:17.001
Or go after love!

01:58:19.917 --> 01:58:21.084
We'll talk about that later

01:58:21.417 --> 01:58:23.667
You bastards!

01:58:36.376 --> 01:58:38.959
One of us won't be setting foot on land today

01:58:39.209 --> 01:58:40.751
That won't be me!

01:58:48.126 --> 01:58:49.917
Thanks, Bandit!

01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:52.501
Pirate! You owe me!

01:59:02.792 --> 01:59:04.001
Captain Yeo-wol!

01:59:04.251 --> 01:59:05.334
Shit!

01:59:06.876 --> 01:59:08.292
Yeo-wol!

01:59:26.251 --> 01:59:28.459
- Oh no!
- Chief!

01:59:39.834 --> 01:59:42.334
It's all over!

02:00:17.792 --> 02:00:21.126
I shouldn't have taken you in, then...

02:00:23.667 --> 02:00:24.834
Run for your life

02:00:25.167 --> 02:00:27.001
The ship is about to explode

02:00:27.417 --> 02:00:29.876
It's the last favor I give you

02:00:30.959 --> 02:00:32.334
Hurry!

02:00:35.376 --> 02:00:36.959
Hurry!

02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:17.417
Run! The ship will explode!

02:01:18.167 --> 02:01:19.417
Hurry!

02:01:20.542 --> 02:01:22.001
Get off!

02:01:22.959 --> 02:01:26.917
Go to hell and apologize to Joong!

02:01:30.542 --> 02:01:31.626
Jump!

02:01:45.542 --> 02:01:46.834
Commander!

02:01:48.251 --> 02:01:50.626
I said same ship, same fate!

02:03:08.417 --> 02:03:09.709
I'm JANG Sa-jung

02:03:12.001 --> 02:03:13.709
Do you remember me?

02:03:17.626 --> 02:03:19.376
What country do I belong to?

02:03:20.042 --> 02:03:23.917
Since Ming gave the name Joseon,
am I a citizen of Ming?

02:03:26.126 --> 02:03:28.542
I don't want to belong to such a country

02:03:29.084 --> 02:03:33.084
A whale swallowing the Royal Seal
is heaven's warning...

02:03:33.459 --> 02:03:36.876
Against ruling under Ming's influence

02:03:37.459 --> 02:03:41.501
Even a whale risks its life to save its baby!

02:03:41.792 --> 02:03:46.959
How can a king sacrifice his people
to find a Ming seal?

02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:54.542
Think about what kind of world you'll make

02:03:56.376 --> 02:03:59.626
If you create a country truly for the people...

02:04:01.876 --> 02:04:05.667
I, too, will uphold you as king

02:04:30.417 --> 02:04:34.917
A whale ate the Royal Seal?

02:04:35.417 --> 02:04:37.417
Forgive us, Your Majesty!

02:04:37.667 --> 02:04:39.167
You fools!

02:04:46.751 --> 02:04:53.709
Send home all the children set
to be offered to Ming!

02:04:54.084 --> 02:04:54.959
Your Majesty!

02:04:55.126 --> 02:04:57.001
But Ming demands them!

02:04:57.209 --> 02:04:58.334
Quiet!

02:04:58.626 --> 02:05:02.167
HAN! Go to Ming at once!

02:05:02.417 --> 02:05:03.209
Sir?

02:05:03.209 --> 02:05:05.792
Go and renegotiate!

02:05:07.001 --> 02:05:08.626
If you fail...

02:05:09.626 --> 02:05:13.251
I'll send your children off as maids and eunuchs!

02:05:13.792 --> 02:05:15.376
Understood!

02:05:18.501 --> 02:05:20.626
Yes, Your Majesty!

02:05:21.417 --> 02:05:23.167
I should've died at sea!

02:05:23.459 --> 02:05:28.667
YI SEONG-GYE FOUNDED JOSEON
IN 1392

02:05:28.834 --> 02:05:33.042
THE ROYAL SEAL WAS RECEIVED
FROM MING IN 1403

02:05:33.167 --> 02:05:36.959
FOR 10 YEARS
AFTER JOSEON'S FOUNDING...

02:05:37.167 --> 02:05:40.876
A TEMPORARY SEAL CALLED
'JOSEON'S ROYAL SEAL' WAS USED

02:05:41.334 --> 02:05:42.501
Hey!

02:05:43.042 --> 02:05:46.751
- Don't tie that there!
- You said to!

02:05:46.751 --> 02:05:47.876
- That's not what I said!
- No!

02:05:48.042 --> 02:05:50.584
The Wind's blowing this way!

02:05:50.792 --> 02:05:54.626
- Stop confusing us!
- You do it!

02:05:55.417 --> 02:05:57.959
When will they get it right?

02:05:58.459 --> 02:06:01.126
I should've killed him back in the mountains

02:06:01.126 --> 02:06:03.501
You said it, Monk!

02:06:05.001 --> 02:06:07.167
I gotta get off this ship
