WEBVTT

00:00.942 --> 00:02.104
I don't fear death,

00:02.139 --> 00:04.098
but I am afraid of being
hooked up to a machine.

00:04.098 --> 00:07.159
If it came to that, my friend,
I would pull your plug.

00:07.159 --> 00:09.183
Pull a plug? I want you to shoot me.

00:09.183 --> 00:12.943
“Professor Clifford Cabot's cabinet
of sexual curiosities”.

00:12.978 --> 00:15.193
I intend for it to be
my legacy to the world.

00:15.193 --> 00:16.171
I need a favor.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.730
I want you to find out if
my daughter is using drugs again.

00:18.730 --> 00:19.306
I'm Rachel.

00:19.306 --> 00:20.899
I'm Brad. Nice to meet you.

00:20.899 --> 00:22.536
<i>Have you made contact with Rachel?</i>

00:22.536 --> 00:24.105
She's been clean for five years.

00:24.105 --> 00:25.957
Denise Bauer, attorney, Daniel Post.

00:25.957 --> 00:26.904
Guy dying of cancer.

00:26.904 --> 00:28.642
You're going off like a dog, aren't you?

00:28.642 --> 00:28.981
What do you mean?

00:28.981 --> 00:32.533
When a dog knows it's gonna die,
it goes off into the woods by itself.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.784
Imagine killing somebody
you deeply love.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.001
You said you'd do it for me.
You promised.

00:37.001 --> 00:38.154
I don't know that I could.

00:38.154 --> 00:38.836
We had sex.

00:38.871 --> 00:39.230
Yes.

00:39.231 --> 00:40.870
Incredible sex.

00:40.905 --> 00:41.346
Yes.

00:41.381 --> 00:42.025
And that's it?

00:42.025 --> 00:42.236
Yes.

00:42.236 --> 00:44.353
If you're okay with going back
to the way things were, so am I.

00:44.353 --> 00:45.279
Just friends.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.276
Friends with benefits.

00:46.276 --> 00:48.550
Alan, Marlene Stanger.
Marlene, Alan Shore.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.575
I look forward to working with you,
Ms Stanger.

00:50.575 --> 00:52.503
Marlene is a first-rate lawyer.

00:52.538 --> 00:53.577
She stole my case.

00:53.577 --> 00:54.759
I thought we could do better.

00:54.759 --> 00:56.834
You are not gonna get very far
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt

00:56.834 --> 00:58.689
pulling the kind of crap you did with this case.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.076
Cancel the rest of your weekend.

01:00.076 --> 01:02.805
I'm taking you to Nimmo bay.
I want to take you to my spa.

01:02.805 --> 01:03.914
What are you doing in my bed?

01:03.914 --> 01:04.438
I don't know!

01:04.438 --> 01:05.539
What do you mean you don't know?

01:05.539 --> 01:06.571
Anything Denny Crane can do,

01:06.571 --> 01:08.433
I can do backwards and wearing high heels.

01:08.433 --> 01:09.112
Who are we?

01:09.147 --> 01:09.792
Denny Crane.

01:09.792 --> 01:11.026
Alan Shore.

01:11.061 --> 01:12.226
Leaders of men.

01:12.261 --> 01:15.091
With bull's-eyes on our asses.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:29.997 --> 01:31.214
What the hell?

01:31.249 --> 01:32.396
Paul, stop them.

01:32.431 --> 01:34.646
Security's been called.

01:35.469 --> 01:37.924
Oh, dear. This could be my fault.

01:37.959 --> 01:40.379
I seem to have mated them both.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.469
Yes, I did, all right.

01:42.504 --> 01:44.627
Jane, Sheila.

01:44.784 --> 01:46.585
Alan, this is absolutely…

01:46.620 --> 01:47.927
Wrong, yes.

01:47.962 --> 01:51.153
Office policy manuals and such.
I know, Shirley.

01:51.188 --> 01:53.199
But you'll just have to cut me
some slack this time of year.

01:53.199 --> 01:54.190
This time of year?

01:54.190 --> 01:56.091
It's spring. I'm in heat.

02:02.769 --> 02:04.226
I hear you're in heat.

02:04.261 --> 02:05.618
It seems so.

02:05.653 --> 02:07.458
Me, too. We must be
on the same cycle.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.401
What do you do when you're in heat?

02:09.401 --> 02:11.311
Generally I have a good deal of sex.

02:11.311 --> 02:12.537
Me, too! Where?

02:12.572 --> 02:13.728
Out and about.

02:13.763 --> 02:15.078
You mean right here in Boston?

02:15.078 --> 02:16.998
It's the most convenient locale.

02:17.007 --> 02:18.254
Don't do that, man.

02:18.255 --> 02:20.730
The women in Boston are
pale this time of year,

02:20.730 --> 02:22.631
and they haven't lost their winter fat.

02:22.631 --> 02:26.461
Like spring snow, Boston women
have their own particular benefits.

02:26.461 --> 02:28.727
Nonsense! You come with me to California.

02:28.727 --> 02:30.081
It's spring all the time there.

02:30.081 --> 02:32.397
I have some business to do
in the Los Angeles office.

02:32.397 --> 02:36.346
We'll have time to prowl all we want,
and we can write the whole thing off.

02:36.346 --> 02:37.877
Denny, in all modesty,

02:37.912 --> 02:41.019
my state of heat doesn't generally
require me to prowl.

02:41.019 --> 02:42.816
Women have a tendency to find me.

02:42.816 --> 02:44.578
Well, let them find you in L.A.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.219
Now don't be difficult.
You know we're going.

02:46.219 --> 02:47.727
We'll take the jet, grab a limo,

02:47.727 --> 02:51.188
drop by Crane, Poole & Schmidt
Los Angeles, do a little business.

02:51.188 --> 02:53.382
Then we'll check in
to Château de Mer.

02:53.382 --> 02:57.784
They have that luxury down bedding
with the 500-thread cotton sheets.

02:57.819 --> 03:00.078
Women love that high thread count.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.562
As do I.

03:01.597 --> 03:02.873
You mean, I've convinced you?

03:02.873 --> 03:06.289
I do have a hankering
for some strip mall sushi.

03:06.324 --> 03:09.706
Yes, the thread count
put me over. A few days.

03:09.741 --> 03:11.471
I'll make some calls.

04:14.144 --> 04:15.795
I was doing research.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.985
At a motel with a prostitute?

04:18.019 --> 04:20.096
I promise you, I've done nothing licentious.

04:20.096 --> 04:21.160
Me neither.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.541
I was cultivating case studies, conducting
interviews with ladies of the eve

04:24.541 --> 04:28.081
for my survey of Victorian
sexual mores versus present-day.

04:28.086 --> 04:29.514
Me, too.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.654
Clifford.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.197
Oh, my God. You don't believe me.

04:33.197 --> 04:36.561
She was naked during the interview.
It looks suspicious.

04:36.596 --> 04:38.279
It was a demonstration speech.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.598
The art of seduction
vis-à-vis clothing removal.

04:40.598 --> 04:41.871
Just ask Lafonda.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.148
Look, Clifford, it doesn't matter
what I think.

04:44.148 --> 04:46.356
You've got your story.
You're sticking to it.

04:46.356 --> 04:48.211
I will post bail.

04:48.542 --> 04:49.835
Shirley?

04:50.262 --> 04:51.428
Yes?

04:51.463 --> 04:54.854
Could you see about
getting my shoelaces back?

04:55.695 --> 04:57.184
Yeah.

05:03.964 --> 05:07.813
Now the legal concepts of sufficiency of evidence
and weight of evidence are different.

05:07.813 --> 05:10.909
A prime example is
the Commonwealth vs Thompkins.

05:10.944 --> 05:11.739
Yes?

05:11.774 --> 05:13.591
<i>Brad, Beth Guttman on line two.</i>

05:13.591 --> 05:15.561
Tell her I'm in a meeting.
I'll call her right back.

05:15.561 --> 05:18.009
<i>She said it was an emergency.</i>

05:18.044 --> 05:20.746
It's my sister.
This will just take a minute.

05:22.872 --> 05:24.903
Yeah, Beth. What's up?

05:25.466 --> 05:28.474
What, when?

05:29.074 --> 05:30.565
Yeah, yeah, okay.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.639
Okay, I'm on my way. Don't let her
say a thing until I get there.

05:42.907 --> 05:43.905
Brad.

05:43.940 --> 05:44.903
Beth.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.739
What happened?

05:47.403 --> 05:49.092
Oh, Hannah was at this party.

05:49.092 --> 05:53.335
Kids were, there were drugs.
And this one boy…

05:53.370 --> 05:57.119
died of an overdose.

06:53.429 --> 06:54.838
Denny, you…

06:57.239 --> 06:58.200
Good Lord.

06:58.235 --> 07:00.320
Does this make me look fat?

07:00.321 --> 07:02.896
Yes, wear heels.

07:03.454 --> 07:06.421
Don't do this. You know
you can't handle Los Angeles.

07:06.421 --> 07:07.483
I'll be fine.

07:07.518 --> 07:10.599
Every spring you take
this little trip out west,

07:10.634 --> 07:14.711
and then we spend every summer, fall and
winter trying to get the charges dropped.

07:14.711 --> 07:17.167
If you're referring to the
Vanna White incident,

07:17.167 --> 07:19.553
there was contributory negligence
on her part.

07:19.553 --> 07:23.915
You groped her rear end during
the whole buffet line at a cocktail party.

07:23.915 --> 07:26.117
How exactly was she negligent?

07:26.152 --> 07:27.131
Her tushy.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.095
Legally, it's called an attractive nuisance.

07:29.095 --> 07:32.999
Look, if you are sincerely concerned
about my dalliances in Los Angeles,

07:32.999 --> 07:34.759
there's one way to prevent them.

07:34.759 --> 07:38.075
Come with me. You know
how I feel about you.

07:38.110 --> 07:40.627
Your wet suit's doing all the talking.

07:42.486 --> 07:44.667
Bogey and Bacall had Paris.

07:44.702 --> 07:46.570
You and I can have Los Angeles.

07:46.605 --> 07:48.862
We can take the first flight out.

07:48.897 --> 07:51.120
Denny, every year I threaten.

07:51.155 --> 07:54.381
Every year I cajole.
All I have left is to plead.

07:54.416 --> 07:57.451
If you care about me,
don't make me plead.

07:57.486 --> 08:00.070
Denny Crane does not make promises,

08:00.105 --> 08:03.647
but for you, I will try
and be a good boy.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.284
Thank you.

08:06.773 --> 08:09.759
How did you get
into that thing, anyway?

08:10.335 --> 08:11.826
A lot of vaseline and

08:11.861 --> 08:15.259
Chuck in word processing helped.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.941
Poor Chuck.

08:16.976 --> 08:19.408
I hope he'll help me
get out of it.

08:19.697 --> 08:21.082
She doubled the client's money.

08:21.082 --> 08:22.311
Denise was there, too.

08:22.311 --> 08:24.168
I thought that was
the case you settled at 10.

08:24.168 --> 08:24.222
Well…

08:24.222 --> 08:25.381
You guys make a great team.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.491
Every team needs a great closer.

08:26.491 --> 08:29.072
Oh, and it really helps that one of you is funny,
because funny helps with the clients.

08:29.072 --> 08:29.604
Her?

08:29.639 --> 08:30.412
Thanks, guys.

08:30.412 --> 08:31.765
Too bad you're both up for partner.

08:31.765 --> 08:32.263
Spring vote.

08:32.263 --> 08:33.436
Always a lot harder.

08:33.436 --> 08:34.789
This place is so sexist.

08:34.789 --> 08:35.188
Four spots.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.816
There's no way they're gonna
give two of them to women.

08:36.816 --> 08:37.734
You guys should team up.

08:37.734 --> 08:41.874
Whoever makes it this time can then
vote for the other one next time.

08:42.544 --> 08:45.069
I'm just gonna run in and grab a seat.

08:45.104 --> 08:46.307
That's what you should do!

08:46.307 --> 08:49.907
And then the other one can just
buy you dinner or something.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.239
We won't know what the boy
died of until after the autopsy.

09:01.239 --> 09:03.897
More than likely a bad mix
of prescription medication.

09:03.897 --> 09:05.207
What are you talking about?

09:05.207 --> 09:07.380
You ever heard of <i>pharming parties</i> ?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.216
No.

09:08.251 --> 09:10.509
Not farming with an “f” but a “ph.”

09:10.510 --> 09:13.004
It's what kids are doing as of late.

09:13.039 --> 09:14.840
They go to their parents'
medicine cabinets,

09:14.840 --> 09:16.353
find the leftover prescriptions.

09:16.353 --> 09:18.577
Pain medicines for backaches,
sleeping pills,

09:18.577 --> 09:20.473
even their own medications for ADD.

09:20.473 --> 09:23.238
They take all these pharma-
ceuticals, get together,

09:23.238 --> 09:26.029
trade them, mix them into
various medication cocktails,

09:26.029 --> 09:28.192
just to see what kind of fun can be had.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.494
This poor kid more than likely
got a bad mix.

09:30.494 --> 09:31.820
Do you know about this?

09:31.820 --> 09:32.726
First I'm hearing.

09:32.726 --> 09:35.227
The kids were smart enough
to dump all the pills down the toilet,

09:35.227 --> 09:38.784
but we found the prescription bottles,
labels missing, in the trash out back.

09:38.784 --> 09:41.369
Hannah would never be involved
in anything like that.

09:41.369 --> 09:42.927
She's already on an antidepressant.

09:42.927 --> 09:45.687
She knows better than
to mix it with anything.

09:45.689 --> 09:47.423
Hannah's on antidepressants?

09:47.458 --> 09:50.576
She's had clinical depression
for two years.

09:55.350 --> 09:57.086
She won't tell me anything.

09:57.121 --> 09:58.822
The other kids aren't talking,

09:58.822 --> 10:01.305
but the DA's not gonna let this one go.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.449
Someone's going to jail.

10:03.756 --> 10:05.623
I'll talk to her.

10:17.611 --> 10:18.960
You cut your hair since Christmas.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.147
Yeah.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.400
Well, we've got a long road
ahead of us.

10:29.400 --> 10:33.003
And I realize you're probably
still in shock but,

10:33.038 --> 10:36.515
as you can see, we've got
a little bit of a problem here.

10:36.550 --> 10:39.025
Besides Ryan being dead?

10:39.060 --> 10:41.378
No, I understand you lost
a friend, Hannah.

10:41.378 --> 10:43.898
But Ryan's parents also lost a son.

10:43.933 --> 10:46.873
And they are not gonna stop,
and nor should they,

10:46.905 --> 10:49.843
until they find out exactly
what happened last night.

10:49.843 --> 10:51.029
And right now as we're talking,

10:51.029 --> 10:54.923
all your other friends are with their attorneys
who are advising them to speak up.

10:54.923 --> 10:58.783
And the first one to speak up is gonna
make a deal with the district attorney.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.139
Everyone else is gonna take
responsibility for the crime,

11:01.139 --> 11:04.096
and someone is going to go to jail.

11:08.508 --> 11:11.884
Hannah, I know you're a good person.

11:11.919 --> 11:14.741
I know you're a good friend,

11:14.776 --> 11:18.691
but this is the one time you need
to think of yourself first.

11:28.915 --> 11:31.730
Um, the Strom trial doesn't begin
until the fall,

11:31.730 --> 11:34.342
so we can discuss that at a later date.
Denise, what have you got?

11:34.342 --> 11:36.631
Uh, the Preitzler deposition starts Monday,

11:36.631 --> 11:39.511
plus I'm still negotiating
on Friedman vs Langston,

11:39.511 --> 11:42.321
and, oh, Paul needs help
on MacCuish and Wassen.

11:42.321 --> 11:43.018
Full load.

11:43.053 --> 11:45.424
Very full. Lots of billables,
but I'm handling it.

11:45.424 --> 11:46.803
Good. In that case…

11:46.838 --> 11:48.297
I'm available.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.464
Excellent, so you're with me
on the Clifford Cabot case.

11:51.464 --> 11:54.524
Okay, people, that does it.
Thank you very much.

12:02.934 --> 12:03.901
Marlene.

12:03.936 --> 12:06.063
You're typing with such intensity,

12:06.098 --> 12:09.963
almost as though there was
some imminent climax.

12:16.321 --> 12:18.493
She's on antidepressants.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.493
I had no idea.
I thought we were close.

12:20.493 --> 12:22.719
Suddenly we're ordinary people.

12:22.754 --> 12:23.896
You're holiday close.

12:23.896 --> 12:25.399
You get together for the biggies,

12:25.399 --> 12:29.168
you know, Christmas, Easter,
share some laughs, old stories.

12:29.203 --> 12:31.939
And there's something
really comforting about that,

12:31.939 --> 12:34.641
but in-between the jokes,
that's where stuff like

12:34.641 --> 12:37.103
“Hannah's got clinical depression”
hang out.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.530
I mean, how do you share
something like that?

12:39.530 --> 12:42.018
Plus, it's Hannah's private business.

12:42.053 --> 12:45.904
Not anymore. It's like we've been
strangers for years.

12:45.939 --> 12:49.197
Do they know everything about you?

12:49.586 --> 12:51.116
Brad?

12:52.675 --> 12:54.419
Can I, um…

12:55.035 --> 12:56.936
Hey, Beth.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.993
They arrested her.

13:00.028 --> 13:01.652
One of the kids talked.

13:01.687 --> 13:04.969
He said it was all Hannah's fault,
that she organized the whole party,

13:04.969 --> 13:06.755
that she brought all the drugs.

13:06.755 --> 13:08.405
I know that's not true.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.446
Where is she now?

13:09.446 --> 13:11.855
Rick's arranging bail.

13:20.923 --> 13:22.334
This is my world.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.710
Welcome to it.

13:23.745 --> 13:26.181
The current research from
the top academics in my field

13:26.181 --> 13:28.582
at the most prestigious
universities in the country.

13:28.582 --> 13:31.772
”Sex and love in the time
of the booty call”.

13:31.807 --> 13:37.014
“Buzz off: A history of anti-vibrator
legislation in the United States”.

13:37.049 --> 13:42.222
All legitimate papers, presented at
the Yale sex week symposium last month.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.698
You know, you have
a way about you.

13:46.823 --> 13:49.023
Anyhow, the paper that
I'm working on entitled

13:49.023 --> 13:53.492
“low as a ho: Privileging sexual purveyors
and the fallacy of phallocentricism”

13:53.492 --> 13:56.076
could only be made possible
through field research,

13:56.076 --> 13:58.591
which is what I was doing
when accosted by the fuzz.

13:58.591 --> 14:02.924
Clifford, I think you can understand how
the police might have mistaken your intentions

14:02.924 --> 14:05.741
and let their imaginations
get away from them.

14:05.776 --> 14:06.941
And that's their problem.

14:06.941 --> 14:09.411
Finally, our universities
are making great strides

14:09.411 --> 14:11.414
in understanding the human sexual condition.

14:11.414 --> 14:14.571
Graphic sexuality has become
ubiquitous in modern society.

14:14.571 --> 14:17.694
It's irresponsible not to teach
young people about it.

14:17.694 --> 14:18.596
These are for real.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.430
You're kidding.

14:19.430 --> 14:22.415
As whacked out as some of these
things sound, no offense, Clifford,

14:22.415 --> 14:25.507
they're all legitimate
scholarly research articles.

14:25.542 --> 14:26.221
Exactly.

14:26.222 --> 14:29.331
Research which required
extensive interviews.

14:29.366 --> 14:32.405
My cousin went to elementary school
with the DA.

14:32.440 --> 14:36.820
I think we've got enough here to go
to him and get these charges dropped.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.650
I like her.

14:47.173 --> 14:49.421
That's not how it happened!
They're lying!

14:49.421 --> 14:50.855
Then you have to tell the truth.

14:50.855 --> 14:53.190
Now these kids are doing exactly
what is expected of them.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.864
They're acting in their own self-interest.

14:54.864 --> 14:59.348
Hannah, you must understand,
you could go to jail for this.

14:59.383 --> 15:04.292
They are charging you
with second degree murder.

15:06.911 --> 15:08.436
No.

15:10.589 --> 15:12.477
No.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.677
Casey, Casey.

15:23.712 --> 15:24.951
When you finish perusing,

15:24.951 --> 15:26.816
please note that what our
client had on his mind was

15:26.816 --> 15:29.464
purely Q&A for research purposes only.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.191
There was no intent to solicit.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.937
Oh, no intent, huh?

15:34.433 --> 15:37.506
You guys want to let us in
on the joke?

15:37.541 --> 15:41.431
We found that professor Cabot,
in doing his research,

15:41.466 --> 15:44.151
was extremely thorough.

15:44.186 --> 15:45.612
Check it out.

15:47.477 --> 15:48.357
Show me!

15:48.392 --> 15:50.783
<i>Show me the plight
of the exploited sex worker.</i>

15:50.783 --> 15:53.058
<i>Oh, and show me your ass.</i>

15:53.350 --> 15:55.482
Oh, dear Lord.

15:55.517 --> 15:57.974
Check it out. She's about to
graduate <i>magna cum laude</i>.

15:57.974 --> 15:59.824
<i>Tell me your quim is quivering!</i>

15:59.824 --> 16:01.757
<i>What's a quim?</i>

16:02.533 --> 16:04.541
<i>Can you believe she didn't know</i>
what a quim was?

16:04.541 --> 16:05.047
Clifford.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.936
I know, it's awful, pure misery.

16:06.936 --> 16:07.972
What do we do?

16:08.007 --> 16:09.710
Plead this out, take your lumps.

16:09.710 --> 16:12.037
I can't do that.
My reputation is at stake.

16:12.037 --> 16:15.163
If I plead guilty, there goes
my entire academic career.

16:15.163 --> 16:18.850
You should have thought of that before
you hired Eliza Doolittle to polish your knob.

16:18.850 --> 16:22.040
Okay, Shirley, yes, I'm guilty.
Put me in shackles.

16:22.075 --> 16:23.116
Let's not go there.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.457
But I really did go to that motel
for research.

16:25.457 --> 16:27.977
Only this time Lafonda
looked so inviting.

16:27.984 --> 16:30.725
Her smile told me everything
was gonna be all right,

16:30.725 --> 16:33.659
and I got carried away.

16:34.413 --> 16:36.151
Shirley, I'm mortified to admit this,

16:36.151 --> 16:38.971
but I hadn't been intimate
with a woman for years.

16:38.971 --> 16:41.777
My wife left me emotionally and sexually

16:41.812 --> 16:44.583
long before we ever parted ways legally.

16:44.618 --> 16:46.520
And loneliness, well,

16:46.555 --> 16:50.252
it isn't something you can
just think your way out of.

16:50.287 --> 16:53.949
Clifford, how many of these
interviews have you done?

16:53.984 --> 16:55.727
With this latest study, 11.

16:55.762 --> 17:00.385
But this is the first time anything
inappropriate has ever happened.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.889
Ooh, maybe it's the third.

17:03.924 --> 17:05.935
We're sunk.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.150
This will stop.

17:19.762 --> 17:20.853
What will stop?

17:20.887 --> 17:22.637
You and your little games.

17:22.672 --> 17:25.238
They're a distraction,
and they will stop.

17:25.272 --> 17:27.974
What do you suggest instead?

17:28.988 --> 17:31.103
We're going to make love.

17:31.138 --> 17:33.458
You're going to give me
everything you've got.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.709
We're going to get this
out of our system.

17:35.709 --> 17:39.714
It will be kept between the two of us,
and then we will move on.

17:39.749 --> 17:41.317
Sounds very organized.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.463
Cut the nonsense.
Are you in or not?

17:43.463 --> 17:46.050
I am very much in.

17:46.085 --> 17:48.573
However, I have some thoughts.

17:48.608 --> 17:51.027
First, I am a bit old-fashioned.

17:51.062 --> 17:54.000
When it comes to certain women,
I prefer to do the stalking.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.362
You've got 24 hours.

17:55.397 --> 17:57.134
I certainly won't be timed.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.916
I think you're vile.

17:58.951 --> 18:00.697
That's a very good sign.

18:00.698 --> 18:04.192
For some, it takes quite a while
to reach that point.

18:04.460 --> 18:11.286
But you seem very in touch with
the worst that the world has to offer.

18:11.719 --> 18:14.499
You've always been a very bad girl.

18:14.534 --> 18:17.244
Now you're working up to awful,

18:17.279 --> 18:20.318
and you think I'm just
the lucky lad to get you there.

18:20.318 --> 18:22.608
You might just be right,

18:22.643 --> 18:25.588
as long as it's messy,

18:25.623 --> 18:28.533
and it hurts just a bit.

18:32.712 --> 18:36.811
Just as soon as I return
from Los Angeles.

18:55.659 --> 18:57.535
This has a familiar feel to it.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.354
Oh, I forgot. You haven't been
to this branch.

18:59.354 --> 19:00.669
How are you? Denny Crane.

19:00.669 --> 19:02.481
I'm a big believer in consistency.

19:02.481 --> 19:05.820
Whether you kill someone
in Boston, New York, Chicago…

19:05.855 --> 19:07.208
Denny Crane.

19:07.243 --> 19:12.201
L.A., London, Tokyo,
you'll feel right at home here.

19:12.473 --> 19:13.760
Oh, my God.

19:13.795 --> 19:15.698
So I'll messenger those contracts
to you this afternoon.

19:15.698 --> 19:17.182
Perfect. Thank you.

19:18.495 --> 19:20.920
Ms Reese. Denny Crane.

19:20.955 --> 19:21.732
Hello.

19:21.733 --> 19:25.213
I'm sorry, the Denny Crane.
Crane, Poole & Sperm, Schmidt.

19:25.240 --> 19:30.810
May I say that I have seen every single one
of the episodes of “Night bay”?

19:30.845 --> 19:31.929
Thank you.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.904
And I wonder, how can they keep
this thing going?

19:34.907 --> 19:38.239
But, you know, night swimmers
need protection, too,

19:38.274 --> 19:41.572
and drug smugglers thrive
under the cloak of darkness.

19:41.607 --> 19:44.566
And this is my colleague Alan Shore.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.888
A pleasure, miss…

19:45.923 --> 19:47.934
Oh, he doesn't watch television.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.932
I doubt he's even seen the sex tape
your boyfriend filmed of you.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.764
I have to go now.

19:55.286 --> 19:56.940
Bye-bye.

19:57.427 --> 19:59.146
I love L.A.

19:59.181 --> 20:01.962
Denny Crane, you son of a gun.
How are you?

20:01.997 --> 20:03.877
Good, good, good.

20:03.912 --> 20:04.702
Barry Goal.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.176
Alan Shore. How do you do?

20:06.176 --> 20:09.051
Senior partner, Crane,
Poole & Schmidt L.A.

20:09.086 --> 20:09.861
Barry Goal.

20:09.896 --> 20:10.638
You said that.

20:10.638 --> 20:12.455
Denny Crane west, almost.

20:12.490 --> 20:13.685
Got it.

20:14.378 --> 20:15.854
Barry Goal.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.558
Docket number 52893.

20:21.593 --> 20:24.825
Commonwealth vs Hannah Guttman
on a charge of second degree murder.

20:24.825 --> 20:25.655
Great.

20:25.690 --> 20:26.286
How do you plead?

20:26.286 --> 20:27.361
Not guilty, your honor.

20:27.361 --> 20:27.862
Bail?

20:27.863 --> 20:29.007
The defense requests ROR.

20:29.007 --> 20:30.893
Hannah's parents can
take responsibility for her.

20:30.893 --> 20:33.201
The defendant is charged
with second degree murder. Bail…

20:33.201 --> 20:34.254
That's way out of whack,
your honor.

20:34.254 --> 20:36.673
This case is involuntary
manslaughter at its best.

20:36.673 --> 20:37.876
You're gonna tell me how to file?

20:37.876 --> 20:41.010
She's overcharging, your honor,
hoping we'll plead for manslaughter.

20:41.010 --> 20:44.109
An innocent boy is dead, your honor.
Forgive me for taking it seriously.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.430
All right.

20:45.465 --> 20:47.186
The defendant has no prior record.

20:47.186 --> 20:49.450
I'm gonna release her into
the custody of her parents.

20:49.450 --> 20:52.155
Conference with the clerk for scheduling.

20:55.561 --> 20:57.175
Hannah…

20:58.372 --> 20:59.714
You're not going to look at us?

20:59.714 --> 21:00.111
Let's go.

21:00.111 --> 21:03.896
You killed our son. You're not
going to even look at us?

21:09.584 --> 21:11.740
And did you take care
of what we talked about?

21:11.740 --> 21:13.074
Just as you requested.

21:13.109 --> 21:16.657
All the amendments to your living will have
been incorporated per your specifications.

21:16.657 --> 21:18.315
We just need the proper signatures.

21:18.315 --> 21:18.771
Excellent.

21:18.771 --> 21:20.902
And just so you know,
we did a search,

21:20.902 --> 21:25.228
and there's no place that will legally
sanction euthanasia by bullet to the brain.

21:25.228 --> 21:26.584
Oh, chest?

21:26.619 --> 21:30.210
Sorry, the most you can hope for
is a slow morphine drip

21:30.245 --> 21:33.408
or counting on Alan here
to pull your plug.

21:33.443 --> 21:34.390
Excuse me?

21:34.425 --> 21:37.863
Denny has amended his living will
to grant you power of attorney

21:37.863 --> 21:40.297
so you can enforce the DNR clause.

21:40.332 --> 21:43.657
Just in case, uh, you know…

21:43.692 --> 21:47.418
Since Cap Weinberger died, I need
someone else to pull my plug.

21:47.418 --> 21:50.710
You're up, Alan.
I've got a slot open.

21:50.745 --> 21:52.279
Hancock?

21:55.523 --> 22:00.314
I'm sorry, Barry. We'll have to
take care of this another time.

22:09.089 --> 22:11.523
We are so screwed
on the Clifford Cabot case.

22:11.523 --> 22:12.926
Really? Oh, I'm sorry.

22:12.961 --> 22:15.204
And you were so eager
to get on that one, too.

22:15.204 --> 22:16.266
I know.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.064
I thought we had a real strong argument

22:18.064 --> 22:21.523
that his encounter with the crazy hooker
was just part of his crazy academic research,

22:21.523 --> 22:23.838
but it turns out
he videotaped the whole thing.

22:23.838 --> 22:25.125
He videotaped it?

22:25.160 --> 22:27.783
Yeah. And it's not one of those
blurry night-vision videos.

22:27.783 --> 22:29.111
This one is crystal clear.

22:29.111 --> 22:30.371
But the important thing is,

22:30.371 --> 22:32.355
he filmed it.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.339
He made a film.

22:34.589 --> 22:37.799
A film which is protected
under the first amendment.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.495
Uh, Denise.

22:40.302 --> 22:42.703
Paul, uh, I can't, not now.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.664
Shirley, I had a thought.

23:01.699 --> 23:03.175
Ride with me.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.126
Get out!

23:11.011 --> 23:11.602
No!

23:11.637 --> 23:15.353
And if he filmed it for distribution
to entertain an audience,

23:15.353 --> 23:19.035
that's pornography, which is protected
under the first amendment.

23:19.035 --> 23:20.630
Good thinking.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.143
What is that pounding?

23:23.317 --> 23:27.157
This building has a lot of quirks.
Haven't you noticed?

23:43.300 --> 23:44.752
Great.

23:45.588 --> 23:47.447
I need your help.

23:50.246 --> 23:52.501
Hannah, this is Rachel Lewiston.

23:52.536 --> 23:53.362
Hi, Hannah.

23:53.397 --> 23:54.387
Hi.

23:55.849 --> 23:58.716
I'm just gonna be out there.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.077
Well, nothing awkward
about this, is there?

24:12.077 --> 24:14.854
I'm sorry, but why am I
even talking to you?

24:14.889 --> 24:17.631
Honestly, 'cause your uncle
is a little lame.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.245
Yeah, he thought I could help you,

24:19.245 --> 24:23.225
but the only thing I can think to do
is to tell you about Jenny Diner.

24:23.225 --> 24:23.966
Who?

24:24.001 --> 24:26.908
She was a girl I met in rehab.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.655
I was there recently.

24:28.690 --> 24:31.971
Jenny's about your age,
angry as hell.

24:32.006 --> 24:34.131
We got along great.

24:35.314 --> 24:39.098
I mean, there were other addicts there
who I had more in common with,

24:39.098 --> 24:41.524
but Jenny and I, um,

24:41.671 --> 24:44.220
well, we really understood each other.

24:44.713 --> 24:46.496
I, um…

24:46.688 --> 24:49.457
I mentioned it to one of
the counselors one day.

24:49.457 --> 24:51.717
He said he wasn't surprised.

24:51.752 --> 24:53.942
They've done studies that show

24:53.977 --> 24:56.462
that drug and alcohol abuse
stunts your emotional growth.

24:56.462 --> 25:00.771
Whatever age you start abusing,
that's the age you are emotionally,

25:00.806 --> 25:04.086
so even though I'm pushing the big 4-0,

25:04.121 --> 25:07.938
and I'm raising a 3-year-old,
in many ways, I'm still 16,

25:07.973 --> 25:13.592
which is why my father's stare
can still make me feel 2 feet tall.

25:13.627 --> 25:19.484
And why my best friend and confidant in rehab
was a 16 year old hooked on heroin.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.929
I don't do drugs.

25:21.964 --> 25:23.451
Hannah…

25:23.486 --> 25:25.067
I just want to tell you

25:25.102 --> 25:29.684
the one thing I learned
the really, really hard way,

25:29.719 --> 25:32.673
and that is you have
to own your crap.

25:32.708 --> 25:35.628
What you do, what you say,
who you hurt,

25:35.663 --> 25:38.612
you have to own all of it.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.939
And if you don't want to be stuck here
at age 16 for the rest of your life,

25:41.939 --> 25:45.642
you're gonna have to tell people
what happened.

26:02.016 --> 26:04.518
Your honor, the defense's motion
to dismiss is absurd.

26:04.518 --> 26:09.174
We have a videotape which clearly shows
that the defendant was caught fully…

26:09.209 --> 26:11.556
in the commission of the illegal act.

26:11.591 --> 26:14.973
It used to be called <i>in flagrante delicto</i>,

26:15.008 --> 26:18.355
but people don't speak
as colorfully anymore.

26:18.390 --> 26:20.388
It's a damn shame, too.

26:20.423 --> 26:22.294
Ms Stanger.

26:22.329 --> 26:24.898
Professor Cabot was indeed
in that motel room.

26:24.898 --> 26:27.499
He did purchase the services
of Lafonda Raymond,

26:27.499 --> 26:30.330
and he did set up his camera
and make a videotape,

26:30.330 --> 26:33.127
and that is why these charges
should be dismissed.

26:33.127 --> 26:35.167
I'm not following you, Ms Stanger.

26:35.202 --> 26:39.737
Your honor, professor Cabot was not
engaged in an act of prostitution.

26:39.772 --> 26:42.412
He was, in fact, making
a pornographic movie,

26:42.412 --> 26:45.346
and as a result, everything he did
is protected under the first amendment.

26:45.346 --> 26:46.166
Oh, come on.

26:46.201 --> 26:50.546
Your honor, professor Cabot is a distinguished
professor and budding director,

26:50.546 --> 26:53.252
but unlike many other first-time
independent filmmakers…

26:53.252 --> 26:54.072
Please!

26:54.073 --> 26:57.566
Professor Cabot comes to his subject
after years of study and research,

26:57.566 --> 27:00.552
which will only serve
to broaden and deepen

27:00.587 --> 27:03.538
the potential impact
of his cinematic creation.

27:03.573 --> 27:05.127
Wow.

27:05.162 --> 27:07.831
I hope you can see through
this ridiculous smokescreen.

27:07.831 --> 27:10.597
It doesn't matter if the defendant
is a professor or a bog worker.

27:10.597 --> 27:13.294
It doesn't matter if he had
ten cameras rolling the whole time.

27:13.294 --> 27:17.499
The fact is, he paid to have sex with
a prostitute, and that's against the law.

27:17.499 --> 27:21.284
Your honor, I have a witness
who will prove my argument.

27:21.445 --> 27:25.661
Mr Craven, have you had a chance to look
at the film made by professor Cabot?

27:25.661 --> 27:26.347
Yes.

27:26.382 --> 27:30.633
In your expert opinion as a filmmaker,
what is professor Cabot doing in the film?

27:30.633 --> 27:33.669
Well, he's acting,
he's directing the action

27:33.704 --> 27:35.779
and, of course, he's screwing.

27:35.814 --> 27:37.512
As part of his performance?

27:37.547 --> 27:38.035
Yes.

27:38.036 --> 27:40.889
So we have acting,
directing, cinematography…

27:40.924 --> 27:43.743
If you include his humming,
he's doing the score.

27:43.743 --> 27:45.479
We're talking about
a film here, aren't we?

27:45.479 --> 27:46.356
Oh, yes.

27:46.357 --> 27:50.229
Now I think we would all agree that
this isn't a particularly good film.

27:50.229 --> 27:50.841
Oh, boy.

27:50.876 --> 27:52.397
But let me ask you this.

27:52.398 --> 27:56.354
Is this film, a film produced
and directed by professor Cabot,

27:56.389 --> 27:59.229
starring himself and Lafonda,

27:59.264 --> 28:01.606
is it the worst film
you've ever seen?

28:01.641 --> 28:04.444
No, not by a long shot.

28:25.756 --> 28:29.848
It was just stuff from
the drug store, prescriptions.

28:29.883 --> 28:31.496
It was safe.

28:31.531 --> 28:34.165
No, not for Ryan.

28:34.427 --> 28:36.579
Everybody's on something.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.958
I have friends who have to take
a pill to wake up in the morning,

28:38.958 --> 28:41.025
to go to sleep, to study.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.532
I need to take something
to calm down before a test.

28:43.532 --> 28:44.762
Hannah, I'm not here to judge.

28:44.762 --> 28:45.969
Yes, you are.

28:45.970 --> 28:47.085
Everyone is.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.081
They're trying to pin
this whole thing on me,

28:49.081 --> 28:51.114
and I didn't organize the party,

28:51.149 --> 28:52.631
and I didn't bring all the drugs.

28:52.631 --> 28:55.768
Okay.

28:55.769 --> 28:58.121
But, um…

29:01.377 --> 29:05.052
I gave Ryan the meds
that killed him.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.866
I was just trying to make him better.

29:09.087 --> 29:10.677
You need to explain this to me.

29:10.677 --> 29:15.211
I can't. You don't know what it's like
to be depressed.

29:15.246 --> 29:16.551
Sure I do.

29:16.586 --> 29:17.856
No, you don't.

29:19.761 --> 29:22.659
Real depression affects you physically.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.522
You literally can't get out of bed.

29:25.557 --> 29:28.647
There's a weight pressing
down on you all the time.

29:28.682 --> 29:31.512
You don't care if you eat,
if you stink.

29:31.547 --> 29:34.336
It's all too much.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.220
And Ryan had it.

29:37.255 --> 29:39.499
I told him to talk to his parents.

29:39.534 --> 29:44.298
They told him to study harder
and play sports after school.

29:44.333 --> 29:48.745
Ryan was drowning,
and they couldn't see it.

29:52.627 --> 29:54.431
The night of the party,

29:54.466 --> 29:59.667
I swear, I gave Ryan
the exact dose that I was taking.

29:59.702 --> 30:03.542
He must have, you know,
had something first, or he was drinking,

30:03.559 --> 30:07.203
or I don't know, he was allergic,
but he wasn't supposed to die, though!

30:07.203 --> 30:09.618
He wasn't supposed to die.

30:09.653 --> 30:12.033
He wasn't supposed to.

30:15.803 --> 30:16.991
So it's true?

30:17.026 --> 30:19.196
Wes Craven was your ace
in the hole?

30:19.231 --> 30:20.698
Paul, she was brilliant.

30:20.733 --> 30:22.943
I know we're not supposed
to say clients are guilty,

30:22.943 --> 30:25.920
but this guy was guilty,
and she got him off.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.481
Oh…

30:28.490 --> 30:30.547
I'll see you, guys.

30:30.582 --> 30:32.570
Marlene, tell me more.

30:32.605 --> 30:37.203
Shirley, I realize there's no way that
I can say this without sounding petty,

30:37.203 --> 30:39.982
but that whole pornography/first
amendment rights thing,

30:39.982 --> 30:42.154
that was my idea.

30:42.189 --> 30:45.521
Yeah, it sounds like you,
but, Denise,

30:45.556 --> 30:48.660
she got to the elevator first.

31:10.809 --> 31:12.002
Denny Crane.

31:13.311 --> 31:14.136
Denny Crane.

31:14.171 --> 31:16.035
I sometimes forget that you're famous.

31:16.035 --> 31:17.643
I'm well-known.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.601
What a small world.

31:24.636 --> 31:25.998
And what big…

31:26.033 --> 31:27.862
You knew she'd be here.

31:27.897 --> 31:30.055
It's her favorite restaurant.

31:30.090 --> 31:32.213
My God, they're beautiful.

31:34.431 --> 31:35.240
Courtney!

31:35.275 --> 31:36.817
Hey, hey, hey.

31:36.852 --> 31:38.383
Knock it off,
give her some space!

31:38.383 --> 31:39.840
What's the matter with you?

31:39.840 --> 31:42.479
Hey, hey.

31:50.196 --> 31:51.992
She's magnificent.

31:52.027 --> 31:54.164
Ever see the show she hosts?

31:54.199 --> 31:56.301
It's called “the Phoenix. ”

31:56.336 --> 31:58.140
Is it about mythology?

31:58.175 --> 31:59.721
Oh, yeah, people would watch that.

31:59.721 --> 32:01.260
No, it's a reality show.

32:01.295 --> 32:05.901
They take these wrecked broads
and make them look, uh, pretty.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.575
She could at least have
shared a drink with me.

32:09.575 --> 32:11.530
Why should she? You stalked her.

32:11.565 --> 32:12.765
I did not stalk her.

32:12.783 --> 32:16.480
You found out where she eats.
You showed up. That's stalking.

32:16.515 --> 32:19.115
All right, why are you
still miffed at me?

32:19.150 --> 32:20.276
I'm not miffed, Denny.

32:20.276 --> 32:21.886
You're miffed enough
to ruin my meal.

32:21.886 --> 32:24.869
I thought being my plug-puller
would be an honor.

32:24.904 --> 32:28.499
It is. And I'm not saying I don't want
to be the one to pull your plug.

32:28.499 --> 32:31.767
I just felt the way the whole package
was presented to me was wrong.

32:31.767 --> 32:34.058
I just told you to sign my document.

32:34.093 --> 32:36.822
Exactly. With something
as monumental as that,

32:36.822 --> 32:39.559
you don't just push a piece
of paper in one's face.

32:39.559 --> 32:40.817
You discuss it first.

32:40.817 --> 32:45.013
We've discussed it plenty of times.
You said you would shoot me.

32:45.048 --> 32:48.014
There's a difference between talking
about it and signing a legal document.

32:48.014 --> 32:50.253
You're a fricking lawyer
for God's sake. That's what you do!

32:50.253 --> 32:52.915
With others, yes. When
it comes to my personal life,

32:52.915 --> 32:55.508
I don't actually sign contracts
at the drop of a hat.

32:55.508 --> 32:58.365
When I say I'll do something, I do it,
regardless of a piece of paper.

32:58.365 --> 33:00.198
And I expect people
to hold me to my word.

33:00.198 --> 33:01.614
What's the matter with you?

33:01.614 --> 33:02.960
People don't do that anymore.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.529
And you certainly can't expect
the hospital to acknowledge your word.

33:06.529 --> 33:09.332
In this case, I can see that.

33:10.137 --> 33:13.020
Well, are you gonna sign
the damn thing or not?

33:15.705 --> 33:17.034
Okay.

33:18.506 --> 33:20.445
I apologize.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.447
How about I ask you properly?

33:23.482 --> 33:24.941
Okay.

33:27.268 --> 33:32.189
Would you do me
the honor of killing me?

33:37.066 --> 33:39.102
I will.

33:39.807 --> 33:43.233
Waiter, champagne.

33:53.136 --> 33:54.482
This is just a nightmare.

33:54.482 --> 33:56.327
It is, but…

33:57.019 --> 33:58.734
we've got a case.

33:59.844 --> 34:01.016
Oh, thank God.

34:01.051 --> 34:04.342
Hannah had a very compelling motive
for giving Ryan those pills,

34:04.342 --> 34:06.743
and I'm almost positive
that I can plead out.

34:06.743 --> 34:09.184
She told you
she gave him the pills?

34:09.219 --> 34:10.054
Yes.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.976
And I believe that she was trying
to help him,

34:11.976 --> 34:14.608
and I think she can
convince the DA, too.

34:14.875 --> 34:19.726
Well, if she pleads guilty,
will she get probation?

34:20.237 --> 34:21.788
No.

34:22.213 --> 34:26.960
It's, she's probably gonna have
to do some time in a juvenile facility,
maybe a year.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.329
No, it would kill her, Brad.

34:29.364 --> 34:31.050
She's a sick girl!

34:31.085 --> 34:32.340
I'll get the best deal that I can,

34:32.340 --> 34:34.463
but I'm certain it's gonna involve
some jail time.

34:34.463 --> 34:37.203
A kid died, Beth.

34:40.764 --> 34:44.181
What if she says
she didn't do it?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.255
But she did it.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.443
Yeah, well, there were a lot
of other kids at that party.

34:47.443 --> 34:49.954
That, that one, Jason
has a prior drug conviction.

34:49.954 --> 34:53.360
What if Hannah just keeps
her mouth shut?

34:53.395 --> 34:54.655
Beth, what are you asking me to do?

34:54.655 --> 34:56.908
I'm asking you to do
what's best for your niece.

34:56.908 --> 34:58.410
What's best for her
is to tell the truth

34:58.410 --> 35:00.294
and get this behind her
and to get on with her life.

35:00.294 --> 35:02.549
No, what's best is
to keep her out of jail.

35:02.549 --> 35:06.869
I'm not gonna pin this on some other kid
when I know that Hannah did it.

35:09.586 --> 35:13.154
Then I'm getting another lawyer.

35:25.199 --> 35:26.483
Hi, Denise.

35:26.518 --> 35:27.733
Marlene.

35:27.768 --> 35:29.858
You know, those girls were right.

35:29.893 --> 35:31.949
We really do make a pretty good team.

35:31.949 --> 35:34.525
I like the way we bounce ideas
off each other.

35:34.525 --> 35:36.250
Well, you know what they say, Marlene.

35:36.250 --> 35:39.610
You can't beat an idea whose time
has come, and, Marlene,

35:39.610 --> 35:42.035
your time is coming.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.505
Does my mom know
we're having this conversation?

35:47.505 --> 35:49.423
Hannah, your mother,

35:49.458 --> 35:51.971
she likes perfect endings.

35:52.006 --> 35:53.146
Tell me about it.

35:53.181 --> 35:55.460
There's no perfect ending here.

35:55.495 --> 35:56.708
There's a lousy one,

35:56.743 --> 35:59.083
where a kid is dead,
you're held accountable,

35:59.083 --> 36:02.366
you end up serving six months,
possibly a year in jail.

36:02.366 --> 36:04.286
Then there's a catastrophic one,

36:04.315 --> 36:07.162
where a kid is dead, you try
to avoid being held accountable.

36:07.162 --> 36:09.863
You roll the dice.
You go to trial. You lose.

36:09.898 --> 36:12.599
You end up serving three years,
possibly more.

36:12.599 --> 36:17.811
Now this perfect life that your mother
was so determined for you to have,
that's off the table.

36:17.811 --> 36:19.436
She's not seeing clearly on this.

36:19.436 --> 36:21.426
And you are?

36:21.427 --> 36:23.465
I know the law,

36:23.500 --> 36:26.368
and I know your mom.

36:26.904 --> 36:32.446
Yes, I'm the one you should
be listening to right now.

36:36.712 --> 36:37.848
Six months?

36:37.883 --> 36:39.386
Juvenile, minimum security.

36:39.386 --> 36:43.194
I may even be able to do better,
but you gotta trust me.

36:47.635 --> 36:52.581
Okay, this is going to look like
I am completely kissing your ass,
and I am,

36:52.616 --> 36:56.462
but look what I actually found
in the cold aisle at the grocery store.

36:56.462 --> 36:57.560
“Schmidt” beer.

36:57.595 --> 37:00.340
Well, would you look at that?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.676
You know I'm good.

38:04.245 --> 38:06.002
You're very good.

38:06.037 --> 38:09.902
I spent nine years working
my tail off to make partner.

38:09.937 --> 38:13.767
In three minutes she comes in
and tries to take my spot.

38:13.802 --> 38:14.872
Marlene?

38:14.907 --> 38:15.943
Squid.

38:15.944 --> 38:20.640
Ruthless, horrible sea creature.

38:20.675 --> 38:23.181
It's so unfair when people like that win.

38:23.216 --> 38:25.079
So don't let her.

38:27.468 --> 38:29.151
Right.

38:38.074 --> 38:39.153
What?

38:39.188 --> 38:41.740
You just kinda…

38:41.775 --> 38:44.292
broke it for me.

38:45.210 --> 38:46.094
Sorry.

38:46.129 --> 38:47.598
No, it's not your fault.

38:47.599 --> 38:49.437
It's this thing with my niece.

38:49.472 --> 38:51.240
We're friends with benefits.

38:51.275 --> 38:54.641
This is supposed to be our break
from all those hassles.

38:54.676 --> 38:57.157
I just can't let it go.

38:59.926 --> 39:04.181
Maybe it would help if you didn't
think about it personally.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.746
You know, if you thought
about it like an attorney.

39:06.746 --> 39:08.470
Okay.

39:08.471 --> 39:13.419
Brad, nothing excites you
as much as the law.

39:13.454 --> 39:14.627
I know.

39:14.662 --> 39:16.927
So imagine yourself…

39:16.962 --> 39:22.242
standing tall in front of the jury box,

39:22.277 --> 39:26.538
adrenaline pumping, juices flowing,

39:26.573 --> 39:30.799
the judge up there with his gavel,

39:30.834 --> 39:32.315
banging,

39:32.610 --> 39:34.094
banging,

39:34.803 --> 39:36.216
banging.

39:36.251 --> 39:37.630
Oh, yeah.

39:43.046 --> 39:47.141
I bet Marlene isn't
getting laid right now.

39:50.335 --> 39:53.355
Alan, I want you to know,
when we get back to Boston,

39:53.355 --> 39:57.588
first thing I'm gonna do is sign
your living will, be your plug-puller.

39:57.588 --> 39:58.675
You don't have to do that, Denny.

39:58.675 --> 40:00.695
I want to do that.

40:00.696 --> 40:02.316
It meant a great deal to me

40:02.349 --> 40:05.832
when you agreed to give me
the, the big send-off.

40:05.867 --> 40:11.161
It was a great show
of affection, of love.

40:11.695 --> 40:13.772
You showed me yours.
Now I want to show you mine.

40:13.772 --> 40:15.231
I certainly appreciate that,

40:15.231 --> 40:19.094
but the fact is my living will,
as it were, is taken care of.

40:19.129 --> 40:20.234
Well, we'll amend it.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.197
There's really no need.

40:21.197 --> 40:21.732
I want to.

40:21.732 --> 40:22.498
You don't have to.

40:22.498 --> 40:23.196
But I want to.

40:23.196 --> 40:24.588
–It's fine.
–It's not.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.554
I'm telling you it is.

40:26.589 --> 40:28.485
I'm telling you it's not.

40:30.236 --> 40:31.796
What are we talking about?

40:31.830 --> 40:32.730
My living will.

40:32.749 --> 40:35.412
Right. So first thing we get back,

40:35.447 --> 40:38.008
I sign on as your plug-puller,
cased closed.

40:38.008 --> 40:39.459
No.

40:40.766 --> 40:43.301
Is there something you're not
telling me? Is there somebody else?

40:43.301 --> 40:45.287
No, it's just I've made my arrangements.

40:45.287 --> 40:47.261
It's not a particularly
pleasant subject to revisit,

40:47.261 --> 40:49.391
so I'm going to preserve the status quo.

40:49.391 --> 40:50.872
You don't trust me.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.313
I do trust you.

40:52.348 --> 40:53.684
Not with this.

40:53.719 --> 40:57.761
Not with your life.
Waiter, bring him the check.

40:58.319 --> 40:59.045
Denny…

40:59.080 --> 41:01.978
The trouble with you is your brain
is so clogged up with big words,

41:01.978 --> 41:04.106
you don't have room for the stuff
that's really important.

41:04.106 --> 41:07.204
Trust in a friendship is a 2-way street,
or there's no friendship.

41:07.204 --> 41:10.267
A real friendship doesn't include
one person being positively giddy

41:10.267 --> 41:12.604
over the prospect of pulling
the plug on the other.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.417
I'm not giddy!

41:13.417 --> 41:18.903
You are. I think part of you really
wants to be the guy who kills me.

41:32.450 --> 41:34.154
I just shot someone.

41:34.189 --> 41:35.941
It's over here.

41:36.671 --> 41:38.018
It's Courtney.

41:38.053 --> 41:39.900
Denny Crane.

41:39.935 --> 41:41.855
Everything's gonna be all right.

41:42.930 --> 41:44.514
Denny Crane.

41:44.549 --> 41:46.064
Call 911.

41:46.099 --> 41:47.528
–Denny Crane.
–Crane, what's going on?

41:47.528 --> 41:49.275
Who is that?
Get out of the way.

41:49.275 --> 41:50.098
Denny Crane.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.453
Sir, sir, who are you?

41:56.590 --> 41:58.420
No, he's still breathing.
