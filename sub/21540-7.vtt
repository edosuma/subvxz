Come with me.

Sold!

00:10.610 --> 00:12.412
- Time to raise the pricing,
Fredrik, is now.

00:12.445 --> 00:13.413
- Now?

00:13.446 --> 00:15.148
- The pricing is set by Steve.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.549
You're gonna have to sell 'em.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.984
- I'd like to talk to you about

00:18.018 --> 00:19.419
the offer that I submitted.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.956
- Aah!
Boom!

- Oh, my God.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.460
The real estate gods

00:31.865 --> 00:34.300

00:50.183 --> 00:51.951
I didn't steal your clients.
They came to me.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.720
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.722
I'm not gonna have
somebody like you steal from me.

to speak to the person
that I bring to your table

01:17.844 --> 01:19.946
without me.
Ever.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.382
- My co-lister for the Jade

01:22.415 --> 01:25.885
is not nearly as nice
as the apartment itself.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.532
<i>to our seller, Sherif.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:42.635
<i>- Sherif called me and</i>

01:42.669 --> 01:44.938
suggested maybe we do
a price reduction.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.345
- I don't know why you're
making this sound like this

01:52.379 --> 01:53.480
is something that is negative.

01:53.513 --> 01:56.383
And I got him to adjust
the price by $3 million.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.584
That's a good thing.
Okay?

01:57.617 --> 01:59.119
- Neither of us has time
to argue about this.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.120
We're very busy today.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.755
- You just busted into my office

02:01.788 --> 02:03.056
to take up my time
to argue about this.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.124
- Yeah, but--really?

02:04.157 --> 02:05.291
But I thought
it was gonna be, like,

02:05.325 --> 02:06.626
a two-minute conversation
where you said,

02:06.659 --> 02:08.628
"Hey, you're right.
We should both be on the call."

02:08.661 --> 02:11.364
- We should be, except this time
he surprise-called me.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.366
- Especially if it's pertaining
to a very important issue.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.069
I should've received a text.
A phone call.

02:16.069 --> 02:19.205
- He was going to call you
the minute he hung up with me.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.276
- Okay.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.878
- Obviously, he had a meeting
or something of that nature,

02:24.911 --> 02:26.413
because I didn't hear
until later.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.747
- Okay. I don't know
his personal schedule.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.084
- But I just feel very
undermined in this situation.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.619
I'm not gonna lie.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.788
<i>- I still don't think</i>
<i>that I was wrong.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:36.756

that I've learned,

<i>co-listing with Luis,</i>
<i>that I did a little while back,</i>

02:39.492 --> 02:45.231
it's that these partnerships
can become incredibly tense,

02:45.265 --> 02:46.933
with a lot of emotions.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.435
- I don't trust you anymore.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.870
After this, you and I are done.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.274
- I just wish it had
happened differently, but--

02:54.307 --> 02:56.142
- And going forward, it can.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.413
Listen, I-I-I think
you are very good.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.382
I think you are awesome.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.050
And we are going to sell this,

03:04.084 --> 03:05.719
by pure feat of your ability

03:05.752 --> 03:08.154
to walk into
a buyer's office unannounced,

03:08.188 --> 03:09.255
and sit down on their couch,

03:09.289 --> 03:11.091
and force them to do a deal.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.692
- [laughs]

03:12.726 --> 03:14.761
- We can do more things
in tandem.

03:14.794 --> 03:15.795
I will make sure.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.230
We should do
a weekly phone call with him.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.965
We do it at the same time.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.934
- Okay.
I'll see you later.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.202
- Okay.
- Ciao.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.204

Jordan?

03:25.238 --> 03:26.206
- Yes?

03:26.239 --> 03:28.975
- Come here for just one second.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.076
- She just walked right past me.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.077
I wasn't here.
Sorry.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.437
- Senor.
You look amazing.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.906
Gerard and Miriam are very
long-time clients of mine,

03:59.939 --> 04:01.207
and when it's like that,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.809
it becomes a little bit more
than just business.

04:02.842 --> 04:03.910
It's a little bit more personal.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.478
You look very sharp,
like always.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.680
They've been together
for 15 years,

04:06.713 --> 04:08.948

04:09.049 --> 04:12.385

that he can continue to produce.

You've been to 860.
You haven't been to 870.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.256
- Oh, okay.
- Correct?

04:16.289 --> 04:18.258
Gerard and Miriam want to move
out from their current apartment

04:18.291 --> 04:19.325

04:21.361 --> 04:22.696
<i>But they want to stay close by.</i>

04:22.729 --> 04:24.564

- Please.
- Come on in.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.068

04:31.771 --> 04:33.973

04:34.074 --> 04:35.875

04:35.909 --> 04:39.079
It's large enough
to seat 14 guests at this table.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.081

05:27.494 --> 05:29.562
You have two sets of
dishwashers.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.164

brighter, I think.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.799
Maybe just
some brighter cabinets.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.401
White or gray, maybe.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.073
- Okay.
Sure.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.375
- Gerard and Miriam have always
been very traditional.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.310
Not just the apartment
that they live in,

05:44.344 --> 05:45.645
but their taste.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.481
- It's--
it looks very formal.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.351
- So I'm kind of surprised.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.752
- I've been traditional
most of my life,

05:52.786 --> 05:54.120
but as I'm getting older,
I think modern

05:54.154 --> 05:55.121
might be more the way to go.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.790
Just to try
something new, you know?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.291

07:57.510 --> 07:59.379
- That's amazing.
I have to say.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.015
- You've really done a nice job
with the art too, I must say.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.049
- Oh, thank you.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.018
Basquiat worked
in this building,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.586
right here where we're
standing, in this basement.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.620
- You know what,
I thought so,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.356
because I--
the first person I met

08:09.389 --> 08:11.458
when I came here
was Andy Warhol.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.326
- Wait, you met Andy Warhol?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.828
- Andy--
I was like a little muse.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.464
- Wait, can I get a hug--
can I?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.498
You can hug me anyway.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.033
- I-I touch--
you touched Andy Warhol,

08:20.033 --> 08:21.034
I touch you.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.469
When you look at Andy Warhol,

08:22.502 --> 08:24.604
it's like--
was he real?

08:24.637 --> 08:26.039
<i>Like, how can somebody</i>
<i>look like that,</i>

08:26.039 --> 08:27.607
<i>act like that,</i>
<i>be such a genius</i>

08:27.640 --> 08:29.275
and so animated?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.811
And I think we can
kind of say that about me.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.883
- I was here a week ago
at the party.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.051
- Mm-hmm, it was great, right?
Wasn't it?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.152
- It was amazing.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.687
But should we talk about
pricing the project?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.088
What's going on with that?

08:42.122 --> 08:44.591
- What--how have the prices
gone up so fast, so quickly?

08:44.624 --> 08:47.127
- Well, it went up 275,000,
I mean, I had 600 people

08:47.160 --> 08:48.128
at the party.
You were there.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.329
- I was there.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.330
- There's just something
about this building,

08:50.363 --> 08:51.664
this location--
everybody wants it.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.967
- Yeah, but you're close
to $2,800 a foot to get in.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.870
- Uh, 3,000--we're like,
a 4 1/2, 5% increase.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.071
- That's crazy.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.340
- I guess I can live
with the higher prices,

09:00.373 --> 09:02.042
<i>but it's challenging.</i>

09:02.075 --> 09:04.010
Dan has to understand--
nobody really wants

09:04.010 --> 09:08.114
to pay more money this week
than they had to last week.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.182
Act now,
because there could be

09:09.215 --> 09:11.217
another increase
in the near-future.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.186
- What are the chances
of getting the schedule like?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.487
Because--
- What do you mean, schedule?

09:14.521 --> 09:17.190
The old prices?
No, that's impossible.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.491
- It's a fabulous building,

09:18.525 --> 09:20.226
but I think
I'm gonna take my ladies

09:20.260 --> 09:24.397
and look at a few other
buildings in the neighborhood.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.499
- Good-bye, Fredrik.
Thank you.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.365
Oh, the whole family's here.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.699

09:59.733 --> 10:00.700

- Hi.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.835
- Hello.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.169
<i>Last time I met</i>
<i>with Gerard and Miriam,</i>

10:03.203 --> 10:04.604
<i>they told me that they wanted</i>

10:04.637 --> 10:05.605
something more modern.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.706
Why didn't you come before?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.241
You don't like
to see apartments?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.243
- No.
[laughter]

10:10.276 --> 10:12.078
- But I've checked
all of the inventory

10:12.112 --> 10:13.213
on the Upper East Side,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.414
<i>and I know for a fact</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:16.116
<i>there is nothing</i>
<i>in their price range</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:18.385
<i>that will give them</i>
<i>all the space that they want,</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:19.753
<i>completely renovated.</i>

10:19.786 --> 10:21.788
So it is time to get creative.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.124
If you were to completely
gut-renovate this townhouse

10:24.157 --> 10:25.358
and make it completely modern--

10:25.392 --> 10:27.060
let's say you spend
$300 per square-foot--

10:27.093 --> 10:29.195
it could open up
to new possibilities.

10:29.229 --> 10:32.432
<i>It's priced right where</i>
<i>they can do renovation</i>

10:32.465 --> 10:34.701
<i>and still be</i>
<i>within their budget.</i>

10:34.734 --> 10:35.935
Anyway, so this is the house.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.506
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>

10:39.539 --> 10:42.676
- The width of the townhouse
is 20 feet,

10:42.709 --> 10:44.110
which is very rare.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.211
- You can play soccer.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.354
- Absolutely.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.955
<i>- The property showed</i>

This is great value.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.126
- Yes.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.294
- So they can have an idea

11:01.327 --> 11:02.896
<i>of what they can do</i>

11:02.929 --> 11:04.064

Although I know you like modern.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.837
- Yeah.

there will be any problem at all

11:23.850 --> 11:25.785
making this very modern.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.520
- It's just too much work.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.255
Sorry.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.358
- Listen, if you want
move-in-ready...

11:31.391 --> 11:33.093
- Yeah, right.
- In this particular location,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.461
it's probably going
north of 15 million.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.429
- It's a big premium.
I know, I know.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.632
- This is the tricky part
about the buying side.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.634
You're always going to
have to sacrifice something.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.169
Will you consider
another neighborhood?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.904
- I mean, at first,
we wanted to stay here,

11:44.938 --> 11:45.939
but I think we will.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.477
So...
- Would you go downtown?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.278
- We'd certainly look, yes.
Definitely.

11:52.312 --> 11:56.383
- I prefer
midtown/uptown.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.952
But we're open.
Very open to it.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.087
- You know, it seems to me
that she's sort of the driver

12:01.121 --> 12:02.789

12:02.822 --> 12:04.824
<i>I don't like to be stuck</i>

12:04.858 --> 12:06.393

We're going downtown.

Do you have
the fermented rice one,

12:24.711 --> 12:26.379

the strawberry one?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.947

12:44.664 --> 12:46.366
Since the price reduction,

12:46.399 --> 12:50.003
Amy and I have been
doing countless showings,

12:50.103 --> 12:53.006
<i>and so far,</i>
<i>she hasn't yelled at me again,</i>

12:53.106 --> 12:55.508
which is good for my chakras.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.776
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

12:56.810 --> 12:58.845
As you get older,
you say weird sh**.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.080
Everything's good.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.149
We have a lot more traffic
than we had before.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.250
That is for sure.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.519
The price adjustment
has been perfect.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.554
We got--

13:10.623 --> 13:13.360
- Not yet, but we have people
who are very serious.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.462
People are just being slow,
which is super annoying,

13:15.495 --> 13:16.496
but it's not
just your apartment.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.498
This is the market in general.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.800
The Chinese economy
is falling pretty hard.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.070
You've got oil
that has completely dropped out.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.872
The stock market
is all over the place.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.074
And all of that affects
these really, really,

13:28.074 --> 13:30.810

I know about Sherif,

13:43.089 --> 13:44.557
it's that he's impulsive.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.359
I mean, he raced through
that first showing

13:46.393 --> 13:47.594
at Astor Place with me,

13:47.627 --> 13:50.497
and then he had to come back
and see it again.

13:50.530 --> 13:54.300
This feels like
it's kind of an impulsive move.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.540

16:07.600 --> 16:10.136
New location, higher price,

16:10.170 --> 16:12.639
<i>and this place is going to take</i>
<i>a while to be built,</i>

16:12.672 --> 16:13.740
but that's okay,

16:13.773 --> 16:15.208
Because they own
their apartment.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.643
<i>And they can wait.</i>

16:16.676 --> 16:18.411
And it's going to be, by far,

16:18.445 --> 16:20.046
much less of a hassle

16:20.046 --> 16:22.549
than renovating
something entirely.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.417
It might be a little
bit of a stretch.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.753
Have you amended
the offering plan? The prices?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.054
- There was a price increase.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.589
- Okay.
- Listen, that's secondary.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.825
Let them fall in love
with the space.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.560
- Okay.
I'm gonna bring 'em here.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.295
- What I long for with Luis now

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
is to do a deal together,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.065
<i>smoothly, from</i>
<i>the beginning to end,</i>

16:39.099 --> 16:41.901
and also it'd be great
to get Dan off my back.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.737
- I need one more thing, though.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.372
I heard that
you were Andy Warhol.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.373
I will need to see it.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.474
- No, but it was one night.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.875
- I want to see--
- It was special to me.

16:48.908 --> 16:49.876
- Please.
- No.

16:56.950 --> 17:02.756
that the gated alleys
stood for paparazzis.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.024

17:15.802 --> 17:17.103
- This is One Great Jones
right here.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.272
- Each bedroom is flanked
like that in each corner.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.775

17:55.909 --> 17:57.410
So hold on one second.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.079
Hello?
Sherif, you there?

18:17.897 --> 18:20.700
- Have I ever actually said
how much I love Amy?

18:20.734 --> 18:23.470
She is a brilliant,
brilliant real-estate agent.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.139
I mean, we sold a lot
where that one person

18:26.172 --> 18:28.675
walks in the door and--
that's the buyer--

18:28.708 --> 18:29.943
and that could happen here.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.294
- This is not okay with me.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.930
I feel very confidently
that we'll get it sold.

19:00.674 --> 19:02.008

19:43.783 --> 19:44.851
- Fredrik Eklund.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.186
Gerard and Miriam

<i>that downtown</i>
<i>is the place they want to be,</i>

19:47.587 --> 19:50.390

19:50.423 --> 19:53.393
- So I hear
that you're done with uptown.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.794
It's boring.
It's old.

19:54.828 --> 19:56.129
There's no good restaurants.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.164
The museums are closing.
It's dusty.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.400
It's where downtown is, right?

20:00.433 --> 20:03.603
- My wife is very demanding.
She knows what she wants.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.472
- She does?
She looks so sweet and innocent.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.806
- I am.
What are you talking about?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.408
- She's not demanding.
- She is in public.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.011
- I'm a little more
demanding in private.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.179
- Well, we're interested in
the full four units.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.547
- Well, we do
need a lot of space.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.016
- Well, I have
the product for you.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.017
Are you ready?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.118

20:22.322 --> 20:24.357
You have a whole water club.
Three different pools.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.992
- This is One Great Jones
right here.

20:26.026 --> 20:27.027

20:27.060 --> 20:30.063
One Great Jones Alley.
24-hour doorman.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.564
Then, what I love
about the floor plan

20:31.598 --> 20:34.067
is that each bedroom is flanked
like that in each corner.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.670
- So it's very different than
what you're used to in uptown.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.671
- This is all open.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.205
- Downtown is all about open.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.541
This is the new way of living.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.877
- To his point, let me
show you these finishes.

20:43.910 --> 20:48.148
Usually, standard
school of practice is that

20:48.181 --> 20:51.251
the selling agent does the show.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.086
There's nothing uptown
about this kitchen.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.288
- You can cook, and you see
all the way to the window...

20:55.321 --> 20:58.058
- And the buyer's agent listens.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.392
- It's very sleek.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.694
- Well, it's sleek,
but it's not too sleek.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.829
It's not modern-futuristic.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.432
Luis should listen more.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.833
- I love these floors,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.068

not just the quality,

21:09.502 --> 21:10.503

21:10.537 --> 21:11.638
- Yeah, no, I do.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.106
And we used

21:13.139 --> 21:14.107
The wood is very warm.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.408
This wood is really beautiful.

- Yeah, I really like it.

I mean, we did.
No more--

21:27.587 --> 21:29.089
- We're very impressed.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.315
- Absolutely.

But these are fairly
small price points

24:27.634 --> 24:31.104
for Manhattan in general,
so it is possible.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.539

24:55.628 --> 24:58.465
I have got to get this listing.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.667
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

25:02.335 --> 25:03.370
- It's too low.

25:03.403 --> 25:04.704
- I don't agree
that it's very low.

25:04.738 --> 25:06.039
- We're gonna insult the seller.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.073
- Give it a try,
because I think--

25:13.747 --> 25:14.347
<i>[instrumental hip-hop music]</i>

25:16.683 --> 25:21.254
<i>* *</i>

25:21.287 --> 25:24.691
[cell phone clicking]

25:24.724 --> 25:26.726
- Gerard and Miriam
really like One Way Jones,

25:26.760 --> 25:28.261
and they want to move along.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.430
But they obviously want value.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.175

- Hey--what the--

25:42.208 --> 25:44.210
- [laughing]

25:45.278 --> 25:47.247
- I don't like that.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.848
- Sorry for sneaking up on you.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.283
- Don't do that to me.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.318
- It's how I say hi.
It's how we say hi in Sweden.

25:52.352 --> 25:54.220
- How you doing?
- I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

25:54.254 --> 25:55.488
Well, by the way,
why are we here?

25:55.522 --> 25:57.457
- You remember
Miriam and Gerard?

25:57.490 --> 25:58.525
- That's why we're here.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.860
- Yeah.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.463
We have an offer.
I think it's a great offer.

26:03.496 --> 26:06.800
It's 9 million
for the ninth floor.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.736
- But the price is 9,555,000.
- I know.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.137
<i>I have room to go up,</i>

26:11.171 --> 26:13.039
but Fredrik doesn't need
to know that yet.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.575
- It's below--
not only below the asking price.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.378
It is below
the original schedule-A pricing.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.780
- He wants to make sure that if
he's buying something downtown,

26:20.814 --> 26:23.950
that he feels like he's getting
something worth his money.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.453
- This is not the building
to negotiate.

26:26.486 --> 26:29.322
<i>I've had lots of showings,</i>
<i>but none offered just yet.</i>

26:29.356 --> 26:31.825
<i>So I was so excited</i>
<i>to send something to Dan</i>

26:31.858 --> 26:33.059
<i>that would make him happy.</i>

26:33.093 --> 26:34.828
Now this could be--
have the opposite effect.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.062
I mean,
Dan could just, like...

26:36.096 --> 26:37.931
[growls]
Ride me even more.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.933
That's 2,600 a foot
in a building where

26:39.966 --> 26:41.801
we're averaging 3,000 now.
It's not--I mean--

26:41.835 --> 26:43.303
- But give it a try,
because I think that--

26:43.336 --> 26:44.471
- It's too low.

26:44.504 --> 26:46.139
- I don't agree
that it's very low.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.108
<i>Gerard and Miriam</i>
<i>mean a lot to me,</i>

26:48.141 --> 26:51.544
and I will
go to war for them.

26:51.578 --> 26:52.645
<i>It's not about me and Fredrik.</i>

26:52.679 --> 26:54.114
It's about me and my clients.

26:54.147 --> 26:55.415
9 million.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.083
- No, we didn't give out
discounts to anyone else.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.251
Everybody else paid full ask.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.352
It's not gonna happen.

26:59.386 --> 27:00.854
- Well, if you say
it's not gonna happen,

27:00.887 --> 27:01.855
it's not gonna happen.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.223
I need you to believe
that it will.

27:03.256 --> 27:06.092
- All I believe in is
that I'm gonna get screamed at.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.761
He's gonna react--
anyway.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.429
How's that for believing?

27:09.462 --> 27:10.864
Sit tight.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.368
- Hi, Dan.
Okay, so we have a live one.

27:15.402 --> 27:17.037
We have a good one.
It's happening.

27:17.037 --> 27:18.238
Ninth floor.
I told you about

27:18.271 --> 27:19.506
the couple
from the Upper East Side.

27:19.539 --> 27:22.342
They're coming in at $9 million.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.950
- Yeah, but
it's the whole sell-out.

27:31.051 --> 27:32.385
It's the 130 million.
It's every unit.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.354
It's not about one unit.
We have to continue.

27:36.890 --> 27:38.158
- Can you come down
a little bit in price?

27:38.191 --> 27:40.060
I need
something to work with.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.967
- Yi, yi, yi.
[groans]

27:48.068 --> 27:49.536
- What happened?

27:49.569 --> 27:50.603
- You know, I tried.

27:50.637 --> 27:52.706
He shot me down completely.

27:52.739 --> 27:53.740
- He's not countering?

27:53.773 --> 27:56.409
- No.

27:56.443 --> 27:57.677
- All right.

27:57.711 --> 27:58.812
I just texted with my clients

27:58.845 --> 28:00.013
while you were speaking
to yours,

28:00.013 --> 28:02.816
and they have authorized me
to go to schedule A.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.851
- You got 'em to 9.125?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.920
- Yes, and they will not
go higher than that.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.388
- But Luis,
that's not gonna work.

28:08.421 --> 28:11.157
I mean, I have a client who
believes in his higher price.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.792
That's the entire reason
he raised it.

28:12.826 --> 28:13.893
- Can you get us
a counter?

28:13.927 --> 28:15.395
- He said no.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.330
Absolutely effing no.

28:17.364 --> 28:21.034
- They're not gonna come
to your full ask.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.602
They're just not gonna do it.

28:22.635 --> 28:25.772
<i>* *</i>

28:25.805 --> 28:27.907
<i>[instrumental hip-hop music]</i>

28:27.941 --> 28:29.409
- While this is
the smallest project

28:29.442 --> 28:30.844
we have going right now...
- Yeah.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.446
- We consider it
extremely special.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.048
- Like, when do you think
it's gonna be done?

28:35.048 --> 28:36.850
- Six to seven months.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.218
- I'm sure you're talking
to other people

28:38.251 --> 28:39.552
who are saying
you got to build out

28:39.586 --> 28:41.888
one big model unit.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.623
I don't think
you need to do that at all.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.325
I think I can sell this
off a plan,

28:45.358 --> 28:49.362
but I would rely
heavily on marketing.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.898
- What exactly comes to mind?

28:51.931 --> 28:55.535
- Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.704
1,000%.
Because this corner--

28:57.737 --> 29:00.006
I used to come here
when I first moved to the city.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.008
The bar that was right here
in the corner of 7th and A--

29:02.042 --> 29:03.543
that's where punk rock started.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.045
I made out with someone
I didn't even know

29:05.078 --> 29:07.514
in Tompkins Square Park,
so this whole park just screams

29:07.547 --> 29:09.783
"crazy love"
and "what's your name" to me.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.051
And then I would walk
down St. Mark's,

29:11.084 --> 29:13.219
and I would see people with,
like, the craziest tattoos,

29:13.253 --> 29:15.655
so I think--
I think we have to do something

29:15.689 --> 29:19.926
that's gonna make people say,
"Holy sh**."

29:20.026 --> 29:21.695
We'll come up
with some crazy signage.

29:21.728 --> 29:25.165
- It's--it's a bit risky,
though, isn't it?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.834
- There's an article that
just came out this past week

29:27.867 --> 29:30.270
about the 40 new
development projects

29:30.303 --> 29:33.306
hitting Manhattan
in the next 90 days.

29:33.340 --> 29:36.509
90 days.
That's crazy.

29:36.543 --> 29:38.712
So I have to take
a massive risk.

29:38.745 --> 29:40.680
- Do people get
frightened of that?

29:40.714 --> 29:42.182
- No.
The more people who know

29:42.215 --> 29:43.783
what you're talking about,
the better.

29:43.817 --> 29:46.186
If you let me do
what I want to do,

29:46.219 --> 29:49.155
I can't have rules.
I don't react well.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.162
- I think it can work.
It's a very unique energy.

29:56.196 --> 29:58.765
It sounds like you might
be able to capture it.

29:58.798 --> 30:04.904
If you can pre-sell 50%,
then I'm a believer.

30:04.938 --> 30:07.240
- Pre-sell.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.341
Before we launch or anything,

30:08.375 --> 30:10.477
you want me to sell
half this building.

30:10.510 --> 30:12.379
- It's very important.

30:12.412 --> 30:16.282
- Um...

30:16.316 --> 30:17.684
I mean, I didn't wait
two years to stand here

30:17.717 --> 30:19.152
to tell you
I can't do something,

30:19.185 --> 30:22.522
so...so ready, set, go.
Let's f***in' do it.

30:22.555 --> 30:24.090
I'll do it.

30:24.124 --> 30:25.125
- Good.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.793
- Sweet.
Awesome.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.294
Great.
Thank you very much.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.429
- All right.
You're very welcome.

30:29.462 --> 30:30.497
- I won't let you down.

- Hope not.

They're just not gonna do it.

30:41.474 --> 30:43.810
- But you're coming in--
just for the record--

30:43.843 --> 30:46.713
$430,000, still,
under the current ask.

30:46.746 --> 30:49.883
- I understand, but he just
raised the price last week.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.052
Listen, he wants what
was going to accept this price.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.319
- I don't know
how to sell it to you,

30:53.353 --> 30:54.854
but you have to understand
from his perspective.

30:54.888 --> 30:57.090
He has 16 units.
He has 18 months to sell it.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.458
He really believes
in this building.

30:58.491 --> 31:01.061
I do too.

31:01.061 --> 31:02.962
- Okay.
- I really try for you.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.731
I'm gonna try again,
and I'm gonna call him again.

31:04.764 --> 31:05.899
I'm gonna just
keep on beating.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.301
But at some times,
I could get fired.

31:08.335 --> 31:10.070
I don't know, Luis.
I really don't know.

31:10.103 --> 31:12.672
It's important for me
to sell another unit,

You disgust me.

31:22.749 --> 31:24.284
- I don't understand.
I'm trying to help you.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.986

You want to control me.

make this deal work.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.195
Only this one.
This is important to me.

31:35.228 --> 31:36.396
And it's important
for the momentum.

31:36.429 --> 31:38.098
If we do this ninth floor now,

31:38.131 --> 31:40.367
I can get you the full higher
price on the eighth floor,

31:40.400 --> 31:42.102
tenth floor, and all the other
units, but I need this--

31:48.308 --> 31:51.311
<i>- I need the seller to</i>
<i>really come down in price.</i>

31:51.344 --> 31:56.349
Otherwise, I'm gonna look like I
overpromised and underdelivered.

- Time kills all deals.

31:57.684 --> 31:59.152
Let's just do it.
Let's make them happy.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.253
They want the building.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.621
They love everything

32:01.654 --> 32:03.156
They love the neighborhood.
Let's just--

32:10.897 --> 32:12.098
- Do we have a deal
with schedule A?

32:12.132 --> 32:13.900
- No, we never had a deal
with schedule A.

Listen, very quickly--

32:28.715 --> 32:30.450

is a very good deal.

this full floor

- Well, guess who's going
to blame me for this?

37:34.688 --> 37:36.723

they are very decisive.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.425
They're already decided.
They're going to spend the--

37:38.458 --> 37:40.193

They just made a decision--

37:40.226 --> 37:41.594

38:00.480 --> 38:01.648
There's something more
I can do.

38:01.681 --> 38:03.083

in this neighborhood.

41:58.952 --> 42:00.620
then I am totally screwed.

42:00.653 --> 42:01.855
- Tell me what's wrong.

42:01.888 --> 42:02.856
- I told you what's wrong.

42:02.889 --> 42:04.090
- Okay.

42:04.124 --> 42:05.325
- I don't want to
talk about it right now.

42:05.358 --> 42:06.960
I just need
to figure this out.

<i>trying to cheer me up,</i>

42:12.532 --> 42:16.336
but I need to come home
and just kind of decompress

42:16.369 --> 42:18.304
and just figure out
how to fix it.

42:18.338 --> 42:20.306
15 missed calls.
Sitting down.

42:20.340 --> 42:21.541
I mean, I could get fired.

42:21.574 --> 42:23.677
I could go down
as the biggest laughing stock

42:23.710 --> 42:25.812
in the history of
New York City real estate.

42:31.785 --> 42:33.353
- Have you checked
your messages?

42:33.386 --> 42:35.555
- Why?
Because people hate me?

42:35.588 --> 42:36.556
- Where are you going?

42:36.589 --> 42:37.924
- I have to go to LA.

Motherf***er.

42:47.467 --> 42:50.737

this apartment sold ASAP.

42:50.770 --> 42:52.505
- Fredrik, I need
to keep business

42:57.777 --> 42:58.945
- What are you saying to me
right now?

42:58.978 --> 43:00.213
I can't believe this.

43:00.246 --> 43:01.581
- Maybe it's time
to pass the torch.
