00:02.586 --> 00:03.963
Rory Gilmore.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.213
- You're taking this class?

00:04.004 --> 00:05.213
- Yes, I am.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.298
Wonderful.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.298
I look forward to it.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.008
I'm suing your company.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.885
My lawyers will be contacting

00:08.049 --> 00:09.885
you Monday morning.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.178
Floyd, you're not serious?

00:11.219 --> 00:13.138
[instrumental music]

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
Which PI Did you have on me,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
dad? Paluso, I assume?

00:17.559 --> 00:20.354
He's the best.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.354
He gets everything.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.648
It's how I found out your

00:20.395 --> 00:22.648
daughter is dating my son.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.692
That's not true.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.278
You'll come back to the firm.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.405
Have your own company

00:28.320 --> 00:30.405
under our umbrella.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.824
And Jason is out.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.283
Jason's out.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.662
Hey.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.330
Oh, I left a tip this time.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.081
And I didn't put it

00:38.372 --> 00:40.081
under the water glass

00:40.123 --> 00:41.291
'cause I know you hate that

00:41.333 --> 00:42.417
and I made sure it didn't

00:41.333 --> 00:42.417
touch the syrup

00:42.459 --> 00:43.711
'cause that

00:42.459 --> 00:43.711
makes it sticky.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.295
And I didn't leave

00:43.752 --> 00:45.295
the last dollar in pennies.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.006
- Just to get rid of them.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.006
- I know.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.716
So why are you running down

00:47.046 --> 00:48.716
the street yelling at me?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.217
I wasn't running.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.217
I was walking.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.552
I wasn't yelling.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.552
I was talking.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.594
Oh, what did you say?

00:52.636 --> 00:53.804
- "Hey."

00:52.636 --> 00:53.804
- Oh, hey.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.096
You are a lot of work.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.765
No,<i> you're</i> a lot of work.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.475
- You heading in there?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.475
- Yeah. I need stamps.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.936
- You heading in there?

00:58.517 --> 01:00.936
- Yep. I'm getting my divorce.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.814
- What?

01:00.978 --> 01:03.814
- Yeah.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.191
Ge...you're getting

01:03.856 --> 01:06.191
a-a-a mail-order divorce?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.609
These are the papers

01:06.233 --> 01:07.609
we had drawn up before.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.694
I just have to sign them.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.070
And you're

01:08.736 --> 01:10.070
signing them in there?

01:10.111 --> 01:11.321
There's a notary in there.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.533
- Luke, that's a Mail Boxes Etc.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.533
- So?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.410
So, you buy envelopes

01:14.575 --> 01:16.410
at a Mail Boxes Etc.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.038
You don't get divorced

01:16.451 --> 01:19.038
at a Mail Boxes Etc.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.164
Because, I don't,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.164
it's not<i> dignified.</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:22.499
Well, crapping out in a marriage

01:22.541 --> 01:24.919
isn't that dignified either,

01:22.541 --> 01:24.919
but I did that.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.545
Look, I just want to

01:24.960 --> 01:26.545
get this over with.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.672
It's not a big deal. I just need

01:26.587 --> 01:28.672
to sign a piece of paper.

01:28.714 --> 01:29.757
You're ending a marriage.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.132
I'm<i> signing a paper.</i>

01:31.174 --> 01:32.467
That says you're

01:31.174 --> 01:32.467
ending a marriage.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.802
Please let me do this.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.387
Why don't you go

01:33.844 --> 01:35.387
to a<i> lawyer's</i> office?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.889
- I hate lawyers.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.889
- How about a friend's house?

01:36.931 --> 01:39.058
Dougie and Scooter

01:36.931 --> 01:39.058
are off at camp.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.225
- This is wrong.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.225
- This is fine.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.518
This is practical.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.437
Getting a divorce

01:41.560 --> 01:43.437
should not be practical.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.731
Look, I only have 20 minutes

01:43.478 --> 01:45.731
until I have to be back at work.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.232
A divorce should not be rushed.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.525
You know, for someone

01:47.274 --> 01:48.525
who's never actually

01:48.567 --> 01:49.568
been through a divorce

01:49.610 --> 01:51.070
you sure know a lot about it.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.529
You should take

01:51.111 --> 01:52.529
a few minutes to think.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.572
I have thought.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.156
It's over. I know it's over.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
And all I have

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
to do is go in there

01:56.450 --> 01:58.702
and sign this paper

01:56.450 --> 01:58.702
in front of a notary

01:58.744 --> 01:59.995
and then it's

01:58.744 --> 01:59.995
<i>officially</i> over.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.163
I'm fine.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.163
Please, I'm begging you

02:02.205 --> 02:04.124
<i>let me get divorced.</i>

02:04.165 --> 02:06.418
Alright, then. Go ahead.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.378
Thank you.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.467
I thought you needed stamps.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.427
- I can get them later.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.427
- What are you doing?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.096
I just thought I'd

02:15.469 --> 02:17.096
give you some privacy.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.513
I'm not taking<i> a shower.</i>

02:18.555 --> 02:20.724
- I'm signing a paper.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.724
- I can come back later.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.517
Will you please get in there

02:20.766 --> 02:22.517
and buy your stamps?

02:22.559 --> 02:23.685
Okay, fine.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.646
Lots and lots of work.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.818
Welcome to Mail Boxes Etc.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.818
How may I help you?

02:30.859 --> 02:31.944
You go ahead.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.445
I need to get something

02:31.986 --> 02:33.445
notarized.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.656
Terrific!

02:33.487 --> 02:35.656
We are happy to help you

02:35.697 --> 02:38.033
with all of your mailing

02:35.697 --> 02:38.033
and notarizing needs.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.827
I will need you to fill out

02:38.075 --> 02:39.827
your name and address

02:39.868 --> 02:41.453
and then I will

02:39.868 --> 02:41.453
need a thumbprint.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.746
I know how it works, Kirk.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.790
- You have a pen?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.790
- I have a pen.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.374
What can I do for you today?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.127
- I can wait till he's done.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.127
- She needs stamps.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.211
- I can wait until you're done.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.211
- Just get your stamps.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.379
- Just get your stamps.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.379
- But, I--

02:51.421 --> 02:53.966
Oh, my God, the work.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.009
I need stamps.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.136
Well, your timing is perfect.

02:57.176 --> 03:00.472
The Breakfast Food series

02:57.176 --> 03:00.472
just came out last week.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.765
Look at the dancing toast.

03:01.807 --> 03:02.850
Aren't they a kick?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.102
And here is our cartoon series.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.812
Hey, do you have any

03:05.144 --> 03:06.812
Lucille Balls left?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.522
Yes, I have some balls.

03:08.563 --> 03:12.734
I'm sorry. Are you a fan of

03:08.563 --> 03:12.734
the 50s/mid 60s sitcom heroines?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.695
I don't know.<i> Am I?</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:15.904
I think you are.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.614
"Bewitched"? I love "Bewitched."

03:17.656 --> 03:20.241
Me too. Dr. Bombay was

03:17.656 --> 03:20.241
a big influence on me.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.828
Oh, my God. Serena?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.828
I wanted to<i> be</i> Serena.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.663
- With that hair.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.663
- And the miniskirts.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.789
And the groovy,

03:24.705 --> 03:25.789
psychedelic music.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.124
Did you practice the twitch?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.709
Oh, who didn't practice

03:27.166 --> 03:28.709
the twitch?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.627
Tabitha was so lucky.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.130
And, hey, what ever happened

03:30.669 --> 03:33.130
to her little brother, Adam?

03:33.172 --> 03:34.756
I mean, they determined

03:33.172 --> 03:34.756
in episode 242

03:34.798 --> 03:36.008
that he was

03:34.798 --> 03:36.008
<i>a warlock</i> and then--

03:36.050 --> 03:37.968
I'm trying

03:36.050 --> 03:37.968
to get divorced here.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.012
Sorry.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.972
I'm sorry.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.601
Remember when Endora

03:44.850 --> 03:46.601
called him, "Derwood?"

03:46.643 --> 03:49.897
Shh.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.897

Sure. As soon as it

learns its place.

You gonna go 10 rounds

04:56.130 --> 04:57.464
Thank you.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.632
What happened to your thumb?

04:58.673 --> 05:00.259
It's from

04:58.673 --> 05:00.259
the thumbprint yesterday.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.177
I thought they had

05:00.300 --> 05:02.177
inkless pads now.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.554
- They do, Kirk doesn't.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.554
- Hmm, right.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.597
He hasn't even heard of them.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.848
He just uses the stuff that

05:06.890 --> 05:08.600
came in the notary kit

05:06.890 --> 05:08.600
he sent away for.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.435
I've been scrubbing

05:08.642 --> 05:10.435
my thumb for<i> two days.</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:12.146
I've tried soap,

05:10.477 --> 05:12.146
I've tried cleaning fluid..

05:12.187 --> 05:13.230
Have you tried fire?

05:13.272 --> 05:14.481
Now not only am I divorced

05:14.522 --> 05:15.690
every time

05:14.522 --> 05:15.690
I look at my black thumb

05:15.732 --> 05:17.400
I'm reminded that I'm divorced.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.443
Sorry about your thumb.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.612
It's okay. I have another one.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.156
Hey, you know what might

05:20.654 --> 05:22.156
make you feel better?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.865
- What?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.865
- Handing me a Cherry Danish.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.827
Well, it's<i> certainly </i>

05:23.907 --> 05:26.827
worth a try.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.120
[cellphone ringing]

05:28.162 --> 05:29.454
- Out!

05:28.162 --> 05:29.454
- But I just got my coffee.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.914
Follow the thumb.

(Rory)

05:37.004 --> 05:38.005
'Who is this?'

05:38.046 --> 05:39.631
This is Lorelai Gilmore.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.967
'No,<i> this</i> is Lorelai Gilmore.'

05:42.009 --> 05:43.384
Ooh, ghastly.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.220
So,<i> you</i> have my phone?

05:45.262 --> 05:47.264
Yes, you left it

05:45.262 --> 05:47.264
in the kitchen.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.099
You know what that means,

05:47.306 --> 05:49.099
don't you? You miss mommy.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.060
Yes, or that the refrigerator

05:49.141 --> 05:52.060
was empty, and I ordered food.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.479
- That makes much more sense.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.479
- Just hold onto it for me?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.689
I'll get it from you

05:54.521 --> 05:55.689
next time I see you.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.107
Okay, Oh, hold on, hon.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.067
[cellphone ringing]

06:00.401 --> 06:01.987
Hello.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.781
So, I'm officially taking

06:02.029 --> 06:04.781
the one hour I have off

06:04.823 --> 06:06.325
to go to the driving range,

06:04.823 --> 06:06.325
to hit golf balls

06:06.365 --> 06:08.327
to try to<i> improve</i> my<i> sucky</i> game

06:08.367 --> 06:10.745
thereby redeeming myself

06:08.367 --> 06:10.745
in your father's eyes.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.790
I like the use of "sucky" and

06:10.787 --> 06:13.790
"thereby" in the same sentence.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.500
- Hey, who's that?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.500
- It's Jason.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.752
- 'Tell him hi.'

06:15.542 --> 06:17.752
- Hey, Rory says, "Hi."

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
- 'Tell her hi back.'

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
- He says, "Hi back."

06:19.796 --> 06:21.464
- Hi.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.464
-<i> This</i> is a sickness.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.217
Well, I'll be in,

06:21.506 --> 06:23.217
in a minute.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.219
- Who are you talking to?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.219
- My other two personalities.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.179
- I'll bring this back inside.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.179
- Wait, wait, bite.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.266
A frightening picture

06:28.596 --> 06:31.266
of things to come.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.810
- Did you talk to anyone yet?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.810
- I left a message for dad.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
I talked to mom

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
but she just had her morning

06:35.312 --> 06:36.437
Mr. Happy pill, so of course

06:36.479 --> 06:38.190
she was having

06:36.479 --> 06:38.190
a happy morning.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.859
And was<i> absolutely no help, </i>

06:38.232 --> 06:40.859
but I'm on it.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.652
- 'A man on a mission.'

06:40.901 --> 06:42.652
- That's me.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.029
- Fire!

06:42.694 --> 06:44.029
- What?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.113
Nothing. I was just

06:44.071 --> 06:45.113
feeling left out.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.573
'Oh, sorry.'

06:46.614 --> 06:47.949
I figure if he hasn't

06:46.614 --> 06:47.949
call me back by 4:00

06:47.991 --> 06:50.244
I'll just go over there.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.246
Okay, I'm at the club.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.246
I'm gonna hang up now.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.955
- Call me later.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.955
- 'Me?'

06:53.997 --> 06:55.165
- No.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.165
- 'No?'

06:55.207 --> 06:56.250
- Not you.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.250
- 'Not me?'

06:56.291 --> 06:57.376
Uh, I'm confused.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.585
Who's hanging up now?

06:58.626 --> 07:00.254
- Uh, that would be me.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.254
- Good. Okay.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.797
I'll talk to you later.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.797
Jason's gone.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.716
- Finally had enough of you.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.716
- Oh, yeah.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.343
It took three hours

07:04.758 --> 07:06.343
of my hula dancing

07:06.385 --> 07:07.761
small world doll impressions,

07:06.385 --> 07:07.761
but I broke him.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.679
So how's World War III going?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.806
Oh, you know, the first boys

07:09.721 --> 07:11.806
off the boat were mowed down

07:11.848 --> 07:13.892
but the next platoon

07:11.848 --> 07:13.892
is moving in.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.685
Jason's making

07:13.934 --> 07:15.685
the lawsuit go away.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.397
Have you talked to grandma or

07:15.727 --> 07:18.397
grandpa yet?

07:18.479 --> 07:19.981
Have you<i> tried</i> to talk to

07:18.479 --> 07:19.981
grandma or grandpa yet?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.024
'No.'

07:21.066 --> 07:22.650
That's my little Kofi Annan.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.652
- Jason will fix it.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.652
- Jason's not their daughter.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.363
Then he might have better luck.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.240
Why don't you just tell them

07:26.405 --> 07:28.240
that you guys were dating?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.866
'Oh, come on. You know why.'

07:29.908 --> 07:32.202
We were going to tell them

07:29.908 --> 07:32.202
when the time was right.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.204
Of course, I had no idea we were

07:32.244 --> 07:34.204
dealing with the Carringtons.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.748
All we needed was a swimming

07:34.246 --> 07:36.748
pool and some ball gowns

07:36.790 --> 07:38.041
<i>to really </i>

07:36.790 --> 07:38.041
end the evening right.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.251
This is unbelievable.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.460
I leave you people alone

07:39.293 --> 07:40.460
for one hour

07:40.501 --> 07:41.836
and all hell breaks loose.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.130
Hey, let's talk about

07:41.878 --> 07:43.130
something happy.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.505
How did your paper turn out?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.174
- 'It sucked.'

07:44.547 --> 07:46.174
- Why did<i> it suck?</i>

07:46.216 --> 07:48.135
I just couldn't find

07:46.216 --> 07:48.135
the right hook.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.844
It didn't feel focused enough.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.055
I don't know. Prof. Fleming's

07:49.886 --> 07:52.055
class is<i> so</i> hard.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.473
'Hon, I bet it was great.'

07:53.514 --> 07:54.849
You have to say that

07:53.514 --> 07:54.849
'cause you're my mother.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.476
Oh, no. I'm not.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.228
I've been looking

07:56.517 --> 07:58.228
for the right time to tell you.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.272
- Okay, I have to go now.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.272
- Yeah, me too. Danish calls.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.564
Talk to parents.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.649
I'm going to take

08:01.606 --> 08:02.649
advice from you

08:02.690 --> 08:03.733
after that paper

08:02.690 --> 08:03.733
you turned in?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.526
- Goodbye.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.526
- 'Goodbye.'

08:07.654 --> 08:09.530
Come on.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.530
I want to do a heavenly prayer.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.491
Hold on, I'm trying

08:09.572 --> 08:11.491
to do a Vulcan sting

08:11.532 --> 08:13.452
and I just let you do

08:11.532 --> 08:13.452
a half moon death combo.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.870
You didn't let me,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.870
I used my soul charge.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.081
Guys, the band meeting

08:15.912 --> 08:18.081
started 10 minutes ago.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.958
We can hear and play

08:18.123 --> 08:19.958
at the same time, Lane.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.584
- What?

08:21.626 --> 08:24.338
Okay, fine. I'm going to decide

08:21.626 --> 08:24.338
the set list without you.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.298
Hey, Gil, I think now

08:24.379 --> 08:26.298
would be a great time

08:26.340 --> 08:28.425
to add a little Matchbox 20

08:26.340 --> 08:28.425
to our sound, don't you?

08:30.677 --> 08:31.928
(announcer on TV)

08:30.677 --> 08:31.928
'Necrid wins!'

08:31.970 --> 08:33.805
- Thank you, Lane.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.805
- You're welcome, Zack.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.183
- Okay, let's<i> do</i> this.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.183
- The gig is Friday night.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.684
Oh, hey, Lane. Who's taking

08:36.224 --> 08:37.684
care of the guest list?

08:37.725 --> 08:39.019
I need to put my wife down.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.103
We got a sitter that night

08:40.145 --> 08:41.562
so we are<i> free to party.</i>

08:41.604 --> 08:42.939
How many people

08:41.604 --> 08:42.939
are we allowed to invite?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.941
'cause my Aunt Susan

08:42.981 --> 08:44.941
left my Uncle Sid

08:44.983 --> 08:46.401
and she's staying

08:44.983 --> 08:46.401
with my parents

08:46.443 --> 08:47.735
and that means she's going to

08:46.443 --> 08:47.735
bring my cousin, Turner.

08:47.777 --> 08:48.862
I'm sure that's fine.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.904
He goes everywhere

08:48.903 --> 08:49.904
dressed like Zorro.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.823
- That still seems fine.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.823
- And he's 16.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.075
One less wedding you're gonna

08:51.865 --> 08:54.075
have to go to, my friend.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.869
You don't know that.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.121
- Here.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.121
- What's this?

08:58.163 --> 09:00.165
It's the names of a couple

08:58.163 --> 09:00.165
chicks I met last night.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.916
Put 'em on the list.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.668
I'm sorry. Why am I suddenly

09:01.958 --> 09:03.668
in charge of the guest list?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.045
'Cause you're

09:03.710 --> 09:05.045
the most reliable.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.339
- How very Rock 'N' Roll.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.339
- Hey, wait.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.548
Is one of those names Dixie?

09:08.589 --> 09:10.884
- Yes.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.884
- Wrong night.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.678
I want you guys

09:10.925 --> 09:13.678
to see something.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.390
I've been working on

09:13.720 --> 09:16.390
the flier for the gig.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.100
Why is there a sandwich on it?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.601
I used a flier

09:19.142 --> 09:20.601
from the sandwich shop

09:20.643 --> 09:21.644
to get the dimensions right.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.104
It's just a prototype.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.856
The real one<i> won't </i>

09:23.146 --> 09:24.856
have the sandwich on it.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.774
So, would there be a picture

09:24.898 --> 09:26.774
of us where the sandwich is?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.776
Or we could put the band name

09:26.816 --> 09:28.776
where the sandwich is.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.028
Just the name,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.028
I think. Diagonal.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.738
Across where the sandwich is.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.324
Everyone needs to stop saying,

09:31.779 --> 09:34.324
"sandwich." I'm getting hungry.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.284
Me too.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.284
Do we have anything to eat?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.618
It was your turn to shop.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.953
- Then no.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.953
- 'Great.'

09:38.995 --> 09:40.121
What kind of sandwich is that?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.582
That's the meatball explosion.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.292
That sounds fantastic.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.753
I would dress up like Zorro

09:44.334 --> 09:46.753
for a meatball explosion.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.880
- Why would those be connected?

09:46.794 --> 09:48.880
- It would be like a dare.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.382
I once ate cheesecake

09:48.922 --> 09:50.382
off the floor on a dare.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.050
Cheesecake.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.094
Cheesecake would be good

09:52.092 --> 09:54.094
with the meatball explosion.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.929
Okay, fine.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.013
'Where you going?'

09:57.055 --> 09:58.306
I'm going to go to the store

09:58.348 --> 09:59.558
and I'm going

09:58.348 --> 09:59.558
to get us some food

09:59.599 --> 10:01.642
so maybe we can

09:59.599 --> 10:01.642
get back to work, okay?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.852
Thanks, mom.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.691
[instrumental music]

10:20.620 --> 10:22.539
[music continues]

10:28.128 --> 10:30.046
[music continues]

10:35.302 --> 10:37.220
Yeah, sure, that's exactly

10:35.302 --> 10:37.220
what I meant to do.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.515
Hey, Owen, good to see you.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.100
Ah, yes.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.100
Good to see you too, Jason.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.518
You know, I was gonna

10:42.142 --> 10:43.518
call you about the changes

10:43.560 --> 10:44.894
in those contracts I sent over.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.354
I'll call Richard

10:44.936 --> 10:46.354
about them tomorrow.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.482
- Okay, or..

10:46.396 --> 10:48.482
- Goodbye, Jason.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.780
All of the woodwork was

10:51.734 --> 10:55.780
hand carved by a union soldier

10:55.822 --> 10:58.241
that the owner,

10:55.822 --> 10:58.241
Mrs. Tinley, took pity on

10:58.283 --> 10:59.867
and nursed back to health.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.578
He got<i> better,</i> went off

11:01.620 --> 11:04.289
slaughtered a few dozen

11:01.620 --> 11:04.289
confederate soldiers

11:04.331 --> 11:06.500
came back,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.500
and made the stairs.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.251
Nice story, yes?

11:08.293 --> 11:12.380
Yes, your American history

11:08.293 --> 11:12.380
is<i> all over</i> this inn.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.466
Oh, look, a deer.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.883
I think I know

11:14.508 --> 11:15.883
that little guy.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.927
'He was here

11:15.925 --> 11:17.927
for breakfast this morning.'

11:17.969 --> 11:19.179
Creep up quietly.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.972
Take a better look.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.725
I have these people

11:22.557 --> 11:24.725
in the palm of my hand.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.811
Travel agents are so easy.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.811
Are the horses washed?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.021
They're washed.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.314
Because I'm not bringing

11:28.062 --> 11:29.314
them out there

11:29.356 --> 11:31.065
to be disgusted

11:29.356 --> 11:31.065
by smelly horses.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.691
Trust me. They've been hosed

11:31.107 --> 11:32.691
down with new car scent.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.068
They're great.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.487
Okay, let's see, uh,

11:34.110 --> 11:35.487
they saw the deer

11:35.529 --> 11:36.863
we released the doves

11:36.904 --> 11:38.697
I've got the Stevens boy

11:36.904 --> 11:38.697
whitewashing the fence

11:38.739 --> 11:40.200
in short pants

11:38.739 --> 11:40.200
and a straw hat.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.035
No one can manufacture

11:40.241 --> 11:42.035
a quaint, small town moment

11:42.076 --> 11:43.244
like you, Michel.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.829
- Oh, travel agents coming back.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.829
- Ugh.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.414
Adorable, yes?

11:46.456 --> 11:49.042
Okay, let me show you

11:46.456 --> 11:49.042
the upstairs, the bedrooms..

11:49.083 --> 11:51.961
Oh, what is that

11:49.083 --> 11:51.961
<i>delicious scent?</i>

11:52.003 --> 11:55.840
Why, I bet our<i> amazing chef, </i>

11:52.003 --> 11:55.840
Sookie St. James

11:55.882 --> 11:58.552
is experimenting

11:55.882 --> 11:58.552
with her cookie recipe again.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.178
Why don't we sneak

11:58.593 --> 12:00.178
into the kitchen

12:00.220 --> 12:02.305
and see if we can convince

12:00.220 --> 12:02.305
her to give us a taste?

12:02.347 --> 12:03.890
- Okay? Follow me.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.890
- 'Coming through!'

12:03.931 --> 12:05.141
(Sookie)

12:03.931 --> 12:05.141
'Coming through!'

12:05.183 --> 12:06.643
- Sookie!

12:05.183 --> 12:06.643
- I'm okay.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.269
- What happened?

12:06.685 --> 12:08.269
- Did you make your cookies?

12:08.311 --> 12:09.896
- Is it your foot?

12:08.311 --> 12:09.896
- I don't think I broke it.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.439
I didn't even hear

12:09.937 --> 12:11.439
a snap this time.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.773
What about the cookies?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.484
Oh, the cookies

12:12.815 --> 12:14.484
are on the counter.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.236
Caramel marshmallow

12:14.526 --> 12:16.236
chocolate chunk.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.820
- Where are you taking her?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.820
- Dr. Su.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.780
Oh, great! He's the best.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.076
Call me the minute

12:21.658 --> 12:23.076
you get there.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.495
Okay. God, I love

12:23.117 --> 12:25.495
having a kitchen again.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.080
Put the doctor on,

12:25.537 --> 12:27.080
so I can talk to him?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.873
- I will. Hey!

12:27.121 --> 12:28.873
- What?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.833
- I'm back.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.833
- Okay.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.091
Well, this is

12:36.548 --> 12:38.091
a nice surprise.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.343
Well, apparently

12:38.132 --> 12:40.343
this is a day for surprises.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.095
Oh, what's the matter?

12:42.136 --> 12:45.139
I spent the entire day trying

12:42.136 --> 12:45.139
to track down your father.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.433
Do you want to sit

12:45.181 --> 12:46.433
or plant or..

12:46.474 --> 12:47.559
I left messages at his house

12:47.601 --> 12:48.602
on his cellphone.

12:48.643 --> 12:49.644
Finally, I went to the office

12:49.686 --> 12:51.730
and he wasn't there.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.524
The only people that were there

12:51.770 --> 12:54.524
were<i> two extremely</i>

12:54.566 --> 12:56.025
uncomfortable

12:54.566 --> 12:56.025
looking secretaries who

12:56.067 --> 12:57.193
practically

12:56.067 --> 12:57.193
threw their back out

12:57.235 --> 12:58.528
trying to avoid

12:57.235 --> 12:58.528
eye contact with me.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
- Why?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
- Why? Yes. A good question.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.031
I asked myself the same thing.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.617
And then I got a call

13:02.073 --> 13:03.617
from Richard's lawyer.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.659
What did he want?

13:04.701 --> 13:05.910
To tell me that Richard's

13:05.952 --> 13:06.994
going back into business

13:05.952 --> 13:06.994
with my father.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.205
<i>What?</i> Jason.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.625
- No, father wouldn't do that.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.625
- He did it.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.126
<i>No,</i> that company

13:11.666 --> 13:13.126
forced him out.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.128
And now they have

13:13.167 --> 13:15.128
welcomed him back in.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.338
He has his own<i> boutique </i>

13:15.169 --> 13:17.338
company under their banner

13:17.380 --> 13:19.299
a<i> big office,</i> no overhead.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.967
Well, there must be some--

13:21.008 --> 13:24.178
And he is taking

13:21.008 --> 13:24.178
<i>all</i> our clients with him.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.891
I...c-couldn't believe it.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.686
I thought it was

13:28.933 --> 13:31.686
one of those<i> crazy,</i> not so funny

13:31.728 --> 13:33.605
Billy Crystal

13:31.728 --> 13:33.605
at the Oscars kind of joke.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.066
So I spent the last two hours

13:33.647 --> 13:37.066
calling every client I could

13:37.108 --> 13:38.318
and they're all gone.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.694
Oh, Jason.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.362
The ones I brought in

13:39.736 --> 13:41.362
from my father's company

13:41.404 --> 13:42.821
the ones I've brought in

13:41.404 --> 13:42.821
since, all gone.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.449
How, how could he do this?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.118
How could my father just

13:44.491 --> 13:47.118
<i>take</i> the business from you?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.328
Oh, no, no, no.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.121
He<i> left</i> me the business, but

13:50.163 --> 13:52.248
<i>without the clients </i>

13:50.163 --> 13:52.248
the business consists of some

13:52.290 --> 13:54.250
stationery, a coffee maker

13:54.292 --> 13:55.585
and some rubber pencil grips.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.128
I don't understand.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.546
Why would my father<i> do that?</i>

13:58.588 --> 14:00.548
Because<i> it's brilliant. </i>

13:58.588 --> 14:00.548
It's<i> perfect.</i>

14:00.590 --> 14:02.175
He gets my dad

14:00.590 --> 14:02.175
to drop the lawsuit

14:02.216 --> 14:03.968
he makes some extra cash,

14:02.216 --> 14:03.968
and he's sitting pretty.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.762
- Makes perfect sense.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.762
- But he was your partner.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.264
And now he's the guy running

14:05.804 --> 14:08.264
around town bad-mouthing me.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.351
It is amazing.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.812
Your father has done

14:11.392 --> 14:13.812
a<i> very thorough</i> job.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.271
I've got nothing.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.273
He has<i> ruined</i> my reputation.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.566
What do I do now?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.360
I don't know.<i> Move?</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:21.820
Start over somewhere else? What?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.988
- Well, you can't move.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.988
- Well, I have to work.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.449
And he's making it<i> pretty</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:26.449
<i>impossible</i> for me to work here.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.535
Oh, my God.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.535
I'm gonna end up in Houston.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.244
Where all the financial

14:28.576 --> 14:30.244
wash-ups wash up.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.954
It's gonna be me

14:30.286 --> 14:31.954
and the Enron boys

14:31.996 --> 14:34.666
smoking cigars while their ankle

14:31.996 --> 14:34.666
cuffs beep in the background.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.168
- What can I do?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.168
- Nothing.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.170
I jus-I just needed to vent.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.170
I'm okay. Thank you.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.048
- Come in.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.048
- No, no. I can't.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.676
I'll call you later. Buh-bye.

You're very kind.

(female #1)

15:31.848 --> 15:33.558
'Thank you, Asher Fleming'

15:33.600 --> 15:37.437
for that very moving excerpt

15:33.600 --> 15:37.437
from your new novel, Jaglon.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.565
It is an<i> absolutely</i>

15:37.478 --> 15:40.565
<i>electric</i> book.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.401
Now, Prof. Fleming has been

15:40.607 --> 15:43.401
kind enough to give us one hour

15:43.443 --> 15:45.236
so if you'll just line up

15:43.443 --> 15:45.236
behind the table

15:45.278 --> 15:46.780
'you can get

15:45.278 --> 15:46.780
your book signed'

15:46.821 --> 15:49.407
and then take them over to the

15:46.821 --> 15:49.407
cash register to purchase them.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.200
- If you'll just follow me.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.200
- My pleasure.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.369
God, he was great.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.369
Wasn't he great?

15:53.411 --> 15:56.247
- He was very impressive.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.247
- He is so commanding.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.416
It's obviously not necessary

15:56.289 --> 15:58.416
for a brilliant novelist

15:58.458 --> 16:01.544
to also be an extraordinary

15:58.458 --> 16:01.544
public speaker, but he is.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.421
- Yes, he is.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.421
- And he's sexy as hell.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.381
Teacher. Mine. Thanks.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.467
Look at all these girls,

16:05.423 --> 16:07.467
just flocking around him.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.968
They're so obvious.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.804
- Well, hello there.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.804
- Hello, Prof. Fleming

16:10.845 --> 16:12.430
I can't tell you

16:10.845 --> 16:12.430
what a thrill this is.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.014
Well, I'm-I'm flattered.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.308
You're a genius.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.770
Am I? How delightful.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.688
I'm buying a copy

16:18.812 --> 16:20.688
for everyone I know.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.190
Well, then, you should meet

16:20.730 --> 16:23.190
some more people.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.525
You'll make my publisher's day.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.322
the multiple book buying ploy?

16:29.363 --> 16:30.406
I mean, what girl

16:29.363 --> 16:30.406
hasn't used that one?

16:30.448 --> 16:31.574
God knows I have.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.033
You want to go up and say hi?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.619
No, thanks. You go.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.704
We won't be disturbing him.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.704
I'm his girlfriend.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.247
It's okay. Really.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.666
Are you hiding from him

16:38.289 --> 16:39.666
because of your paper?

16:39.707 --> 16:40.708
I'm not hiding.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.835
I just don't need to know how

16:41.876 --> 16:43.544
much it sucks before it's time.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.129
You might be over reacting.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.673
Oh. No. Smell that?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.673
What's that?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.466
Oh, yeah.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.466
I believe that's my paper.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.176
Thanks. I'll stay here.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.928
Please, she's going to hover.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.262
Pathetic.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.555
Hey, did I show you this?

16:54.597 --> 16:55.974
Look.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.893
"To a wise, willful,

16:56.015 --> 16:58.893
wonderful woman."

16:58.935 --> 17:00.812
That's me.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.812
He dedicated it to me.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.397
- Wow, that's very nice.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.397
- I know.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.650
It's not very specific,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.650
but it's very nice.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.318
Well, what's he supposed

17:05.692 --> 17:07.318
to do, write my name?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
- Perish the thought.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
- You know the situation.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.154
I do.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.322
And as long as I know that

17:11.364 --> 17:12.615
the wise, willful,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.615
wonderful woman is me

17:12.657 --> 17:13.908
who cares who else knows?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.242
You're right. I'm sorry.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.828
I'm just stressed

17:15.284 --> 17:16.828
about my paper.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.205
Well, don't take

17:16.870 --> 17:19.205
your loser paper out on me.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.456
Is he out of water?

17:20.498 --> 17:22.333
I'm going

17:20.498 --> 17:22.333
to get him some water.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.460
Paris, I'm sorry.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.460
The dedication's nice.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.462
Thanks.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.422
Oh, yes. Like they read.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.013
Well, this was

17:33.052 --> 17:35.013
a royal waste of my time.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.347
However, there were cookies.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.016
Here, hold some,

17:36.389 --> 17:38.016
so I don't look like a pig.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.183
You didn't enjoy the reading?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.643
I wasn't here

17:39.225 --> 17:40.643
to enjoy the reading.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.102
I was here to cover

17:40.685 --> 17:42.102
the reading for the paper

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
to go along with

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
the review of the book.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.231
And then I arrive

17:44.146 --> 17:45.231
only to realize

17:45.272 --> 17:46.649
that every single available girl

17:46.691 --> 17:48.735
at Yale is here, including

17:46.691 --> 17:48.735
four of my reporters.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.486
I'm not here on paper business.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.780
I'm here because I enjoy books

17:50.528 --> 17:52.780
and because I read books.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.198
- Please.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.198
- I do.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.575
- And Paris?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.575
- She's with me.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.035
- And Anna and Cassie?

17:55.616 --> 17:57.035
- Point, Doyle.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.327
Everybody's here because

17:58.369 --> 18:00.204
'Fleming's

17:58.369 --> 18:00.204
an intellectual<i> dreamboat.'</i>

18:00.246 --> 18:01.831
Well, I'm not here

18:00.246 --> 18:01.831
for the dreamboat.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.999
God, that man.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.667
He's got a constant

18:03.041 --> 18:04.667
rotation going.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.045
A new girl every year.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.045
Very young, of course.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.713
Last year, it was Trey Myers.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.130
God, was she beautiful.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
She looked like,

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
what I always pictured as

18:11.257 --> 18:12.258
a Swedish stewardess to be.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.509
- Really?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.509
- Yep.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.719
Then they broke up

18:13.551 --> 18:14.719
at the end of the term

18:14.761 --> 18:16.178
and she rebounded

18:14.761 --> 18:16.178
with a drama major.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.556
So any idea who he's seeing now?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.891
Actually, no.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.184
This year's girl

18:19.933 --> 18:22.184
is a bit of a mystery.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.394
Maybe he's already

18:22.226 --> 18:23.394
broken up with one

18:23.436 --> 18:26.313
and he's trolling for another.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.942
My money's on the redhead.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.902
[doorbell ringing]

18:33.029 --> 18:34.906
Hi. I'm looking for my father.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.198
Big guy, bow tie.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.491
Mr. Gilmore's

18:36.240 --> 18:37.491
in the living room.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.118
Thank you.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.416
Well, you're here.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.835
Lorelai. I didn't know

18:45.458 --> 18:47.835
you were coming over.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.004
- I called.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.004
- Yes, well..

18:50.046 --> 18:51.589
...I haven't been

18:50.046 --> 18:51.589
in the mood to talk.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.424
- Well, we need to.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.424
- I felt like reading.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.217
Why are you doing this, dad?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.386
Well, reading is good for you.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.386
You learn things.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.139
Jason was your partner.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.433
If we are going to discuss this,

19:00.180 --> 19:02.433
let's go into my office.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.726
Jason was your partner

19:03.768 --> 19:05.311
and he said

19:03.768 --> 19:05.311
he was gonna take care of it.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.353
- Lorelai--

19:05.352 --> 19:06.353
- Dad, No.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.397
I'm fine talking right here.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.067
Jason said he was

19:08.439 --> 19:11.067
taking care of everything

19:11.109 --> 19:13.653
and you didn't even give him a

19:11.109 --> 19:13.653
chance before you cut him out--

19:13.694 --> 19:15.071
This is business.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.614
No, you took everything

19:15.113 --> 19:16.614
from him, dad.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.949
You're ruining his reputation.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.700
You're making it impossible

19:17.991 --> 19:19.700
for him to work.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.410
I did what I had to do.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.787
You didn't have to do this.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.997
Well, thank you

19:22.829 --> 19:23.997
for your opinion.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.748
That company was

19:24.038 --> 19:25.748
so horrible to you.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.750
They treated you like dirt,

19:25.790 --> 19:27.750
they forced you out

19:27.792 --> 19:29.168
and you chose them

19:27.792 --> 19:29.168
over him?

19:29.209 --> 19:30.837
<i>I am not</i> choosing

19:29.209 --> 19:30.837
anyone over--

19:30.878 --> 19:32.797
I just don't understand

19:30.878 --> 19:32.797
why you would do this.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.048
Is it because of me?

19:34.090 --> 19:35.466
Are you taking this out

19:34.090 --> 19:35.466
on him because--

19:35.508 --> 19:37.635
Did you not hear

19:35.508 --> 19:37.635
what the man said?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.637
Did you not hear Floyd

19:37.677 --> 19:39.637
threaten to go after

19:39.679 --> 19:41.139
everything your

19:39.679 --> 19:41.139
mother and I have?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.765
- Yes--

19:41.180 --> 19:42.765
- Everything I've worked for.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.308
This house, our livelihood.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.893
There has to be

19:44.350 --> 19:45.893
something else you can do.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.561
- Go home, Lorelai.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.561
- No, dad, please.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.229
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I

19:49.271 --> 19:50.982
'lied to you about dating Jason'

19:51.024 --> 19:53.526
but you can't

19:51.024 --> 19:53.526
destroy him like this.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.986
I'm hardly destroying him.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.403
You took his entire business.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.571
You've left him with nothing.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.198
He's talking about moving.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.198
Leaving.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.449
So what?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.327
So? I'm-I'm in a relationship

20:00.491 --> 20:03.327
with him.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.495
Then go with him.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.456
You know I can't<i> go with him.</i>

20:07.498 --> 20:09.876
I have a business,

20:07.498 --> 20:09.876
I have a house, I have Rory.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.544
I-I can't just

20:09.917 --> 20:11.544
pick up and leave.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.212
Well, then,

20:11.585 --> 20:13.212
you've made your choice.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.382
- Dad,<i> stop it. </i>

20:13.253 --> 20:16.382
- I am tired of this, Lorelai.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.634
You've shown

20:16.423 --> 20:18.634
absolutely no concern

20:18.676 --> 20:19.844
about what happens to me

20:18.676 --> 20:19.844
what happens to your mother.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.095
The only thing you care about is

20:21.137 --> 20:22.513
what happens to<i> your boyfriend.</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:24.182
And the worst part of it

20:24.223 --> 20:26.266
is that I never expected

20:24.223 --> 20:26.266
you to act any differently.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.205
Is it really necessary?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.706
Is what really necessary?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.124
Going after Jason like this.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.334
I didn't know

20:50.166 --> 20:52.334
you were a fan of Jason's.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.545
I'm not. I'm just concerned.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.215
What are you

20:54.587 --> 20:57.215
concerned about, Emily?

20:57.256 --> 21:00.342
It took us a long time to get

20:57.256 --> 21:00.342
Lorelai back into this house

21:00.384 --> 21:03.054
and she<i> is dating Jason.</i>

21:03.096 --> 21:04.222
What are you saying?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.556
I<i> worry</i> that if you do this

21:05.598 --> 21:07.474
you'll drive Lorelai away again.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.351
And if she goes, Rory might go.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.937
She lied to us. To you. To me.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.730
I am very well aware

21:10.978 --> 21:12.730
of what she did.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.315
The last time I checked, you

21:12.772 --> 21:15.315
didn't care for being lied to.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.194
Don't be condescending.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.194
I<i> don't</i> like being lied to.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.987
We can't control

21:18.236 --> 21:19.987
what Lorelai will do.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.239
'Rory won't go away.'

21:21.280 --> 21:23.365
I'm doing what I have to do.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.499
Who does she think she is?

21:32.541 --> 21:33.542
Just walking out of my house

21:33.584 --> 21:35.128
like she owned the place.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.046
Your mom didn't just

21:35.169 --> 21:37.046
go out and get another kid.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.465
Korea is where you go

21:37.088 --> 21:39.465
to get new kids. Ask anyone.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.092
'There has to be

21:39.506 --> 21:41.092
another explanation.'

21:41.134 --> 21:42.676
The explanation is

21:41.134 --> 21:42.676
I've been replaced.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.970
You have not been replaced.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.805
She was wearing

21:44.011 --> 21:45.805
my bunny sweater.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.974
You hated that bunny sweater.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.974
That's why you left it there.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.226
She also had

21:48.015 --> 21:50.226
my second least favorite scarf

21:50.268 --> 21:52.979
and she was eating my apple.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.939
The apple my mother would have

21:53.020 --> 21:54.939
given me if I still lived there.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.441
Which you don't.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.441
By your own choice, might I add.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.859
Now you're taking her side.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.027
'I'm not taking her side.'

22:00.069 --> 22:01.445
I've been replaced.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.571
Drop by when you're in town

22:02.613 --> 22:04.657
meet your new best friend.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.408
Tip her well when she

22:04.698 --> 22:06.408
waits on you at Luke's.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.161
Head over to the church

22:06.450 --> 22:08.161
with her, share a pew.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.036
Lane.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.663
My mom has found a new daughter.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.706
- I bet this can needlepoint.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.706
- Look, I've got to go.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.792
Paris said I could use ten day

22:12.748 --> 22:14.792
ten minutes on her phone

22:14.834 --> 22:17.128
and after that, her exorbitant

22:14.834 --> 22:17.128
prevailing rates apply.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.671
So I'll call you back

22:17.170 --> 22:18.671
when I get to my room.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.298
Oh, wait, are you coming

22:18.712 --> 22:20.298
to the gig on Friday?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.049
Gig? Yes.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.049
What time do you go on?

22:22.091 --> 22:23.425
8:00.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.425
Which means 8:30.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.927
Shoot. Friday night dinner.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.262
'Oh, I forgot.'

22:26.304 --> 22:27.805
I don't think

22:26.304 --> 22:27.805
I'll make it in time.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.640
- That's okay.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.640
- 'But I want to see your gig.'

22:29.682 --> 22:31.017
We will have other gigs.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.101
Of course,

22:31.058 --> 22:32.101
by that time the other Lane

22:32.143 --> 22:33.560
will be drumming in the band.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.979
Well, as long as

22:33.602 --> 22:34.979
she's got a good downbeat.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.314
Have you gone out for

22:35.021 --> 22:36.314
the pep squad yet?

22:36.354 --> 22:37.439
I'll call you

22:36.354 --> 22:37.439
in a little while.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.983
- 'Bye.'

22:37.481 --> 22:38.983
- Bye.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.985
- Excuse me.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.985
- Oh, right.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.570
A B-minus.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.570
Oh, thank God.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.072
- Not bad.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.072
- Are you kidding?

22:45.114 --> 22:47.158
A B-minus

22:45.114 --> 22:47.158
in Fleming's class is like

22:47.200 --> 22:49.576
an "A" anywhere else

22:47.200 --> 22:49.576
in sane America.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.079
Let's celebrate.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.041
[instrumental music]

23:01.505 --> 23:04.008
[rock music]

23:08.428 --> 23:10.348
[pounding]

23:12.933 --> 23:14.852
[knocking on door]

23:22.818 --> 23:23.986
College is loud!

23:24.028 --> 23:25.738
Yes, it's part of our training.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.198
It's right up there

23:25.779 --> 23:27.198
with the bad food

23:27.240 --> 23:28.532
the sleep deprivation

23:28.574 --> 23:31.077
how to hold your own hair

23:28.574 --> 23:31.077
while throwing up.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.703
- What are you doing here?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.703
- Inn stuff.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.706
I had to pick up hinges

23:32.745 --> 23:35.706
and doorknobs and faucets.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.291
And I figured

23:35.748 --> 23:37.291
while I was<i> in the hood</i>

23:37.333 --> 23:38.542
I'd drop this off.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.585
- Hey, thanks.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.585
- You're welcome.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.212
Hey, you didn't have to do that.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.671
You could have just given it

23:41.254 --> 23:42.671
to me at Friday night dinner.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.090
Hmm, I<i> could</i> have.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.966
Unless you're not going

23:44.131 --> 23:45.966
to Friday night dinner.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.009
You're not going

23:46.008 --> 23:47.009
to Friday night dinner.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.261
- Rory?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.261
- Why?

23:48.302 --> 23:49.511
Things have gotten worse.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.637
How could they be worse?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.265
They were already at worse.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.849
Dad is going after Jason

23:53.891 --> 23:55.976
and...it's complicated,

23:53.891 --> 23:55.976
but<i> it's really bad.</i>

23:56.018 --> 23:57.228
And I went over there to try to

23:57.270 --> 23:58.771
talk to him about it

23:57.270 --> 23:58.771
and he was horrible.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.189
He said awful things to me.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.941
- Like what?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.941
- Like, things.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.651
It doesn't matter,

24:01.982 --> 24:04.651
but I-I can't<i> just go</i>

24:04.693 --> 24:06.570
and sit there

24:04.693 --> 24:06.570
and make<i> small talk</i>

24:06.612 --> 24:07.780
and pretend that

24:06.612 --> 24:07.780
everything's okay.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.240
- Mom.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.240
- Because it's<i> not</i> okay.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.408
You were mad, he was mad.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.034
- You said some things--

24:10.448 --> 24:12.034
- No, Rory.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.786
No. Now, I don't doubt

24:12.076 --> 24:13.786
that it was bad.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.371
You and grandpa

24:13.827 --> 24:15.371
can make each other crazy

24:15.413 --> 24:17.581
but maybe once he calmed down,

24:15.413 --> 24:17.581
he was sorry.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.541
- He is not sorry.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.541
- 'You could be wrong.'

24:19.583 --> 24:21.168
Maybe if we go over there

24:21.210 --> 24:22.920
and give him a chance

24:21.210 --> 24:22.920
to make it right, he would.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.089
Oh, boy, honey, you're living

24:22.962 --> 24:25.089
in fuzzy-puppy land.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.506
Mom, it's really

24:25.131 --> 24:26.506
important to me

24:26.548 --> 24:28.134
that you don't back out

24:26.548 --> 24:28.134
of Friday night dinners.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.843
They're the only time that

24:28.175 --> 24:29.843
the whole family gets together.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.430
Sometimes it's the only time

24:29.885 --> 24:32.430
that I get to see you

24:32.470 --> 24:34.390
and I like having it there.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.473
It's really important to me.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.726
- Rory, come on.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.726
- I'm serious.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.396
Please, just give him a chance

24:37.768 --> 24:40.396
to make it up to you. Please.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.772
I'll be there.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.565
- I'll be your buffer.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.565
- You will, huh?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.858
Absolutely.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.403
They can focus on me,

24:44.900 --> 24:47.403
you can focus on me.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.363
What about when he throws

24:47.445 --> 24:49.363
his glass of water in my face?

24:49.405 --> 24:50.614
Then I will get very wet.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.450
- I'm holding you to that.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.450
- Yep.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.618
[loud rock music]

24:54.660 --> 24:55.995
Whoa!

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
Caesar, I need

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
a turkey burger, fries well-done

24:58.289 --> 25:00.374
and I'm still waiting for

24:58.289 --> 25:00.374
that grilled cheese and tomato.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.625
Patience is a virtue.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.085
Light a candle,

25:01.667 --> 25:03.085
and tell it to the pope.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.921
I want

25:03.127 --> 25:05.921
my grilled cheese,<i> pronto.</i>

25:05.963 --> 25:07.840
- Excuse me, Lane?

25:05.963 --> 25:07.840
- Uh, yes, Kirk.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.842
- I'm a little confused.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.842
- About what, Kirk?

25:09.883 --> 25:11.885
Well, I'm looking at

25:09.883 --> 25:11.885
this flier you gave me

25:11.927 --> 25:14.263
and what exactly do you have

25:11.927 --> 25:14.263
to do to get the sandwich?

25:14.305 --> 25:15.889
What?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.766
I mean, does everyone

25:15.931 --> 25:17.766
who shows up get a sandwich

25:17.808 --> 25:19.268
or is it first come,

25:17.808 --> 25:19.268
first sandwich?

25:19.310 --> 25:20.811
Oh, that's a mistake.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.146
The sandwich isn't

25:20.853 --> 25:22.146
supposed to be there.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.481
What are you saying?

25:23.521 --> 25:25.024
I'm saying that's

25:23.521 --> 25:25.024
just a flier for our band.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.066
We're playing Friday at 8:30.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.609
So, there's no sandwiches.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.111
- No.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.111
- Then, why would I go?

25:29.153 --> 25:31.655
- To hear some great music.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.655
- Oh.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.032
Can I bring my own sandwich?

25:33.073 --> 25:35.826
Hey, Lane?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.328
I know it's time

25:35.868 --> 25:37.328
for your break now

25:37.370 --> 25:39.621
but is it okay

25:37.370 --> 25:39.621
if I let Caesar take his?

25:39.663 --> 25:41.123
He owes me a grilled cheese.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.209
I'll do it. He's gotta run

25:41.165 --> 25:43.209
to the bank or something.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.793
To be honest, I wasn't paying

25:43.250 --> 25:44.793
too much attention

25:44.835 --> 25:45.878
'cause he was bugging me.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.838
- No problem.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.838
- Thanks.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.804
I'm taking my ten!

25:59.308 --> 26:01.227
That looks

25:59.308 --> 26:01.227
like it travels well.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.355
- Hey. Who are you?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.355
- Hi.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.856
- What are you doing here?

26:04.397 --> 26:05.856
- Where?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.233
- Why're you living in my house?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.233
- Your house?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.566
That house right there.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.566
It's mine.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.277
- What are doing there?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.277
- I'm staying there.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.987
- Why? Are we related?

26:10.319 --> 26:11.987
- I hope not.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.113
How do you know Mrs. Kim?

26:13.155 --> 26:14.990
I am exchange student

26:13.155 --> 26:14.990
from Seoul.

26:15.032 --> 26:17.410
I'm here for three months,

26:15.032 --> 26:17.410
and Mrs. Kim is my host.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.994
- Exchange student, huh?

26:17.451 --> 26:18.994
- Yes.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.787
- Who are you?

26:19.036 --> 26:20.787
- I'm Mrs. Kim's daughter.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.289
She did tell you

26:20.829 --> 26:22.289
she had a daughter, right?

26:22.331 --> 26:24.166
- Yes.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.166
- Well, she does, and it's me.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.709
So you can try

26:24.208 --> 26:25.709
whatever tricks you want.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.045
- I will always be her daughter.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.045
- Why are you so mad?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.297
- Because you<i> stole my life. </i>

26:28.087 --> 26:30.297
- I<i> did not</i> steal your life.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.216
You're living in my room.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.216
You're wearing my clothes.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.551
And don't tell me

26:32.258 --> 26:33.551
you always looked like that.

26:33.591 --> 26:34.843
[yelling in Korean]

26:34.885 --> 26:35.969
I'm not very crazy!

26:36.011 --> 26:38.097
[yelling in Korean]

26:38.138 --> 26:40.598
How would you like it

26:38.138 --> 26:40.598
if I moved into<i> your</i> house?

26:40.640 --> 26:41.641
Why don't you just

26:40.640 --> 26:41.641
go back home?

26:41.683 --> 26:44.270
[speaking in Korean]

26:44.311 --> 26:46.564
You don't have to feel sorry

26:44.311 --> 26:46.564
for Mrs. Kim. Mrs. Kim is fine!

26:46.604 --> 26:49.316
And give me back my sweater, and

26:46.604 --> 26:49.316
my second least favorite scarf!

26:51.110 --> 26:52.986
On Tuesday,

26:51.110 --> 26:52.986
we'll continue our look

26:53.028 --> 26:54.863
at neglect of the individual

26:54.905 --> 26:57.450
as a hallmark

26:54.905 --> 26:57.450
of modern government.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.660
Be prepared to discuss

26:57.491 --> 27:00.660
Kafka's "The Trial."

27:00.702 --> 27:04.373
Yes, if, uh, if all goes well,

27:00.702 --> 27:04.373
it'll get very ugly.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.750
'Thank you, everyone.'

27:06.792 --> 27:08.710
[indistinct chattering]

27:12.965 --> 27:15.593
Oh, very nice job

27:12.965 --> 27:15.593
on your paper, Miss Gilmore.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.553
Oh, thank you.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.806
You know, Prof. Fleming

27:20.847 --> 27:23.183
I was actually a little

27:20.847 --> 27:23.183
surprised by my grade.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.435
Were you?

27:24.477 --> 27:27.229
Well, you deserved it.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.229
You did good work.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.523
To be honest,

27:27.271 --> 27:29.523
I don't feel like I did.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.817
Ah, a perfectionist.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.319
No, I'm not a perfectionist.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.446
I just know when I do well

27:33.360 --> 27:35.446
and when I don't.

27:35.488 --> 27:38.157
You know, this sounds as if

27:35.488 --> 27:38.157
you're questioning your grade.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.827
Well, maybe I am.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.288
Well, this is a first.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.415
Today alone, I've heard

27:44.330 --> 27:46.415
complaints from, uh

27:46.457 --> 27:49.042
two D's, four C's, and an "F"

27:49.084 --> 27:51.170
but, uh, not from an "A."

27:52.588 --> 27:54.840
In fact, in 35 years of teaching

27:54.881 --> 27:56.758
I've never heard from an "A."

27:56.800 --> 27:59.803
I just want to be sure

27:56.800 --> 27:59.803
that the grade I got is

27:59.845 --> 28:01.514
what I deserve.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.681
What exactly are you saying,

28:01.555 --> 28:03.681
Miss Gilmore?

28:03.723 --> 28:06.352
Just that if the grade I got

28:03.723 --> 28:06.352
wasn't legitimately earned

28:06.393 --> 28:07.769
then I have no interest in it.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.813
Oh, how very noble of you.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.565
I intend to earn

28:09.855 --> 28:11.565
all of my grades.

28:11.607 --> 28:12.650
I don't want any favors.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.360
And why exactly

28:12.690 --> 28:14.360
would you think

28:14.401 --> 28:16.820
that I'd be inclined

28:14.401 --> 28:16.820
to grant you any favors?

28:16.862 --> 28:18.780
- I'm not saying that you are--

28:16.862 --> 28:18.780
- You're not?

28:18.822 --> 28:21.283
Oh, then I must have

28:18.822 --> 28:21.283
misunderstood this conversation.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.285
- I'm just saying that--

28:21.325 --> 28:23.285
- Yes?

28:23.327 --> 28:26.246
That I want to earn

28:23.327 --> 28:26.246
all of my grades.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.081
Yes, you've already said that.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.583
No matter how many

28:29.625 --> 28:32.044
"wise, willful,

28:29.625 --> 28:32.044
and wonderful women" I know.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.383
Have you quite finished?

28:37.424 --> 28:38.967
I suppose I have.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.636
Oh, before you go

28:39.009 --> 28:40.636
any further, Miss Gilmore

28:40.678 --> 28:43.263
let me assure you

28:40.678 --> 28:43.263
that<i> I do not</i> give grades

28:43.305 --> 28:44.973
that are not earned.

28:45.015 --> 28:48.060
'I gave you an "A" because your

28:45.015 --> 28:48.060
argument was well structured'

28:48.101 --> 28:51.271
your writing

28:48.101 --> 28:51.271
was clear and concise.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.815
And you drew a connection

28:51.313 --> 28:53.815
from Marsilius of Padua

28:53.857 --> 28:56.735
to Machiavelli

28:53.857 --> 28:56.735
to the modern age of media

28:56.776 --> 29:00.573
that PhD candidates

28:56.776 --> 29:00.573
would envy.

29:00.614 --> 29:04.826
In fact, no one else's paper

29:00.614 --> 29:04.826
was that thoroughly researched.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.539
Except for the other person

29:04.868 --> 29:08.539
who also got an "A."

29:08.581 --> 29:11.458
You did what was demanded,

29:08.581 --> 29:11.458
and you did it well.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.959
And I would

29:11.500 --> 29:12.959
seriously caution you

29:13.001 --> 29:16.255
not to question

29:13.001 --> 29:16.255
my grading tactics again.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.881
Okay.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.217
Thanks for the "A."

29:20.259 --> 29:22.344
And the redhead

29:20.259 --> 29:22.344
has fat thighs.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.517
Come on.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.227
Hey, hey, there's no hurry.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.227
We're early.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.770
Yes, but we're here,

29:30.269 --> 29:31.770
so we might as well

29:31.811 --> 29:33.021
go in and get it over with.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.482
Okay, just relax,

29:33.063 --> 29:35.482
why don't you?

29:35.524 --> 29:37.568
I would like to stop and smell

29:35.524 --> 29:37.568
the roses if you don't mind.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.694
- Mom.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.694
- You're-you're young.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.195
You don't understand

29:38.736 --> 29:40.195
these things.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.030
I'm old, I'm dying,

29:40.237 --> 29:42.030
I'm gonna smell a rose.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.074
Oh, I don't see a rose.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.074
I think there's one next door.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.326
You're being a tad ridiculous.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.326
Come on.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.786
On a scale of

29:46.368 --> 29:47.786
one to a million

29:47.827 --> 29:48.954
how awful do you think

29:47.827 --> 29:48.954
tonight's gonna be?

29:48.995 --> 29:50.414
Well, how high a number

29:50.456 --> 29:51.998
did you think the walk

29:50.456 --> 29:51.998
up the driveway was?

29:52.040 --> 29:53.626
Ugh.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.671
You know, I wonder which tact

29:53.667 --> 29:57.671
my dad's gonna pick tonight.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.256
I bet he goes with

29:57.713 --> 29:59.256
the silent treatment.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.592
- Or maybe he won't.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.592
- Yeah, you're right.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.636
He might prefer the full-on,

30:01.634 --> 30:03.636
frontal assault.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.804
You know,

30:03.677 --> 30:05.804
just constant mental flogging

30:05.845 --> 30:08.223
right from "ding-dong"

30:05.845 --> 30:08.223
through till "drive safe."

30:08.265 --> 30:09.433
Well, at least

30:08.265 --> 30:09.433
he said "drive safe."

30:09.475 --> 30:11.977
Oh, no. It wasn't him.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.977
It was the maid.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.896
Or maybe dad will be fine,

30:12.018 --> 30:14.896
and Emily will be on the attack.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.650
Yeah, a little good cop, bad cop

30:14.938 --> 30:17.650
if you know what I mean.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.359
Keep me on my toes.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.359
I won't be expecting that.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.778
Except that you are. Ready?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.572
Okay. Wait, just wait.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.572
We can still leave.

30:23.614 --> 30:24.864
- No.

30:23.614 --> 30:24.864
- Rory.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.492
Right now is the point

30:24.906 --> 30:26.492
in the horror movie

30:26.533 --> 30:28.368
where the entire audience

30:26.533 --> 30:28.368
is yelling "Don't go in there."

30:28.410 --> 30:30.162
I will be right

30:28.410 --> 30:30.162
beside you, okay?

30:30.203 --> 30:32.581
Okay, but I'm telling you

30:32.623 --> 30:34.249
if my dad gets ugly

30:34.291 --> 30:36.209
I'm out of there.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.463
[doorbell ringing]

30:41.923 --> 30:44.802
Lorelai. Rory.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.802
You're early.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.969
Yeah, no traffic.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.888
No? Well, that's very..

30:48.930 --> 30:50.849
Uh, come in.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.062
Did you hit much traffic?

30:56.104 --> 30:58.940
Um...no.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.940
No traffic at all.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.484
Well, good.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.444
Uh, nothing like

31:00.526 --> 31:02.444
an hour stuck in traffic

31:02.486 --> 31:05.656
to ruin your complete day.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.240
Should I take your coats?

31:07.282 --> 31:08.950
That's okay.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.950
We can just put them here.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.744
Alright.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.996
Well, you're early,

31:10.786 --> 31:12.996
so I'm not quite organized yet

31:13.038 --> 31:15.165
but, uh,

31:13.038 --> 31:15.165
shall we have some drinks?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.208
(Lorelai)

31:15.207 --> 31:16.208
Okay.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.836
Alright. There's no ice.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.878
Do we need ice?

31:19.919 --> 31:21.171
Uh..

31:21.213 --> 31:23.382
Of course, we need ice.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.300
There's some in the kitchen.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.300
I'll go get it.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.969
Okay. He doesn't seem mad.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.139
All depends on which definition

31:28.011 --> 31:31.139
of "mad" you're going with.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.974
(Lorelai)

31:31.181 --> 31:32.974
'Mom.'

31:33.016 --> 31:35.101
Lorelai. Rory. You're early.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.354
Um, yeah, we didn't

31:35.143 --> 31:37.354
hit any traffic, so..

31:37.396 --> 31:39.565
well, it-it-it's nice

31:37.396 --> 31:39.565
to see you.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.607
(Lorelai)

31:39.606 --> 31:40.607
'Where were you?'

31:40.649 --> 31:42.067
- When?

31:40.649 --> 31:42.067
- Just now.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.820
O-oh, well,

31:42.108 --> 31:44.820
I had to run out to the store.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.239
- To get what?

31:44.862 --> 31:47.239
- They were out.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.116
- Emily, the girls are early.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.116
- I see that.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.451
Is that ice?

31:51.493 --> 31:54.538
Yes. We need it

31:51.493 --> 31:54.538
to make the drinks.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.831
'Oh, shoot.'

31:55.873 --> 31:57.624
'You should take the bucket'

31:57.666 --> 31:59.459
into the kitchen

31:57.666 --> 31:59.459
the next time.

31:59.501 --> 32:02.421
Yes, that would've been

31:59.501 --> 32:02.421
the smart thing to do.

32:02.462 --> 32:05.716
Well, I was making drinks.

32:05.758 --> 32:09.177
- So, uh, Rory, how is school?

32:05.758 --> 32:09.177
- It's fine.

32:09.219 --> 32:11.430
Um, I just got

32:09.219 --> 32:11.430
an "A" on a paper.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.056
Oh! Well, that's wonderful.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.933
You gonna let go

32:13.098 --> 32:14.933
of that purse, mom?

32:14.974 --> 32:16.685
Well, you're holding pretty

32:14.974 --> 32:16.685
tightly to your purse there.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.144
You look like

32:16.727 --> 32:18.144
someone's Tante Flickman.

32:18.186 --> 32:22.148
- Oh, well, I, uh, just...there.

32:18.186 --> 32:22.148
- Okay.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.817
- It's new.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.817
- The purse?

32:23.859 --> 32:25.985
Yes, it's new.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.985
I'm trying to break it in.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.363
Sure. Otherwise,

32:26.027 --> 32:28.363
you'd get blisters.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.283
Well, here we are.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.910
- Lorelai.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.910
- Thank you.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.578
And soda for Rory.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.830
Emily?

32:36.872 --> 32:39.291
Well, good.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.710
Uh, so...cheers.

32:41.752 --> 32:42.920
- Cheers.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.963
(Emily)

32:42.961 --> 32:44.963
Cheers.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.715
So, Rory, how's school?

32:46.757 --> 32:49.885
Fine. I just got

32:46.757 --> 32:49.885
an "A" on a paper.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.219
Has she told you

32:49.927 --> 32:51.219
about the traffic?

32:51.261 --> 32:52.888
Dinner's ready.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.306
It is?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.891
It-it's only just 7:00 now.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.184
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.184
What time did you want dinner?

32:58.226 --> 33:00.771
- 'You didn't tell me, so..'

32:58.226 --> 33:00.771
- You know what? It's alright.

33:00.813 --> 33:01.814
We'll just eat now.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.273
- Now?

33:01.855 --> 33:03.273
- 'Okay.'

33:03.315 --> 33:04.608
'But what do we do with the--'

33:04.650 --> 33:05.818
Just take your drinks

33:04.650 --> 33:05.818
to the table.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.152
Take our drinks to the--

33:07.193 --> 33:09.321
Oh, I'll grab

33:07.193 --> 33:09.321
the cocktail napkins.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.323
But, mom,

33:09.362 --> 33:11.323
you left your purse.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.826
- Oh, yes.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.826
- Mom?

33:13.867 --> 33:15.494
- What?

33:13.867 --> 33:15.494
- I was just kidding, mom.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.412
Oh, you.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.081
Okay, so every time they ask you

33:17.454 --> 33:20.081
about school or traffic..

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
- ...just do a shot.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
- Shh.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.520
Thank you.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.902
[clearing throat]

33:54.073 --> 33:55.701
So, what's for dessert?

33:55.742 --> 33:57.285
We're not having dessert.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.037
- We're not?

33:57.327 --> 33:59.037
- I-I'm on a diet.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.664
Americans are extremely fat.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.081
I think they prefer<i> reubenesque.</i>

34:02.123 --> 34:03.333
You're not fat, grandma.

34:03.375 --> 34:07.004
Well, thank you, Lorelai.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.088
She was close.

34:11.633 --> 34:12.634
Well, okay.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.761
If we're not having dessert

34:14.803 --> 34:16.930
then we should go?

34:16.972 --> 34:18.139
- Alright.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.139
- See you next Friday.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.391
Thank you for coming.

34:19.432 --> 34:21.267
- Oh.

34:19.432 --> 34:21.267
- Thank you for having us.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.855
Wait. The Gordons gave us some

34:21.309 --> 34:24.855
<i>wonderful</i> chocolate last week.

34:24.897 --> 34:25.898
They bought

34:24.897 --> 34:25.898
it back from Belgium.

34:25.939 --> 34:27.190
You can take it with you.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.026
No, mom, that's okay.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.026
We're fine.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.194
These are really good

34:29.067 --> 34:31.194
chocolates, Lorelai.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.030
- I'm sure they are, dad.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.030
- Did you find them, Emily?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.072
Grandpa, we can just

42:03.813 --> 42:06.483
in my chosen profession

42:06.565 --> 42:08.067
then, yeah, I have to.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.778
Don't be just a business guy.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.364
Put this on another level.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.364
Please.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.406
I can't.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.782
- Unbelievable.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.782
- Lorelai.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.575
I have no choice.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.453
- I have to fight back.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.453
- Jason..

42:18.495 --> 42:20.830
I will keep you out of this.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.830
I promise.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.001
I can't be with someone

42:22.540 --> 42:25.001
who's suing my family.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.128
- Lorelai, come on.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.128
- I'm<i> sorry.</i>

42:28.338 --> 42:29.964
You saw what your

42:28.338 --> 42:29.964
father did to me.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.383
I know

42:30.006 --> 42:31.383
what he did to you.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.176
And he is not gonna stop

42:31.424 --> 42:33.176
until there's nothing left.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.011
I'm asking you

42:33.218 --> 42:35.011
not to do this.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.971
Ask me something else.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.971
Anything else.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.307
- This is what I want.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.307
- You know how hard I work.

42:39.349 --> 42:42.435
My job is who I am.

42:39.349 --> 42:42.435
I can't lose everything.

42:42.477 --> 42:43.769
You have to understand

42:42.477 --> 42:43.769
why I'm doing this.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.938
I do understand.

42:45.980 --> 42:49.442
But I can't be with someone

42:45.980 --> 42:49.442
who's suing my family.

42:49.484 --> 42:50.693
