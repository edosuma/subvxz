LOUIS: Come on, Treville.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.580
Now, you can do better than that.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.730
(GRUNTING)

00:10.740 --> 00:12.580
Rest, now, sire.

00:13.387 --> 00:14.397
Nonsense!

00:15.670 --> 00:16.680
I'm fighting fit today.

00:16.705 --> 00:18.231
Come on, I'll take both of you!

00:18.256 --> 00:21.265
Majesty, you've worn me out.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.300
Some proper opposition then, D'Artagnan!

00:23.363 --> 00:24.775
D'ARTAGNAN: I would love to, Your Majesty,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.398
but I have sustained
a wound on my sword hand.

00:26.423 --> 00:29.413
- I should probably...
- And these are my defenders.

00:29.423 --> 00:32.323
You know, Treville used teach me
how to fight when I was a lad.

00:33.393 --> 00:35.343
It seems like I've surpassed him.

00:40.061 --> 00:41.423
He forgot everything I thought him.

00:41.433 --> 00:42.663
(CHUCKLES)

00:42.687 --> 00:44.322
But I will say this,

00:44.323 --> 00:45.363
he never lacked courage.

Louis.

Louis?

02:11.503 --> 02:13.303
Find Athos.

02:21.513 --> 02:23.303
Sire.

02:23.453 --> 02:24.453
Forgive me.

02:34.172 --> 02:35.212
It's happened.

02:36.097 --> 02:37.227
God rest his soul.

02:37.252 --> 02:38.907
Take the king,

02:38.954 --> 02:41.798
hide him somewhere in the city until
I tell you it is safe to return.

02:41.823 --> 02:42.843
(SIGHS)

02:42.868 --> 02:45.323

02:45.333 --> 02:47.333
Involve only people you trust.

02:48.701 --> 02:49.721
Not Aramis.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.363
You don't trust Aramis?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.897
Not with this. No.

02:53.922 --> 02:55.453
It's safer if he doesn't know.

02:55.463 --> 02:56.463
You're right.

02:58.013 --> 03:01.023
I'm going to make you
an honorary Musketeer.

03:01.048 --> 03:04.048
It means you have to be brave
and clever and strong.

03:07.776 --> 03:09.686
I hear you're a born horseman.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.453
Hold on tight.

03:11.893 --> 03:12.893
You'll like this.

03:17.725 --> 03:18.805
D'ARTAGNAN: Will this work?

03:20.363 --> 03:22.363
Civil war is coming to Paris

03:23.631 --> 03:25.551
and that child is the prize.

04:15.863 --> 04:19.843
I swear I will protect our son

04:19.853 --> 04:23.753
so he will live long
enough to be a great king.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.693
Bring me my son.

04:41.602 --> 04:42.738
Where is he?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.449
I have sent him away
from the palace into hiding.

04:45.474 --> 04:48.246
- He's not safe!
- He wasn't safe the moment the king died.

04:48.271 --> 04:49.280
He's protected here!

04:49.305 --> 04:51.152
No one is protected here!

04:51.443 --> 04:54.302
The Duke of Lorraine's army are
preparing to march on Paris.

04:54.327 --> 04:55.583
They are coming for him.

04:55.593 --> 04:58.168
You're gambling with my son's life!

04:58.193 --> 04:59.583
I am saving it!

05:01.543 --> 05:04.493
Majesty, I have entrusted
him to one of my Musketeers.

05:05.533 --> 05:06.533
Who?

05:08.402 --> 05:10.362
You have no right to do this, Treville.

05:10.387 --> 05:11.477
Tell me where he is.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.483
(SIGHS)

05:18.503 --> 05:20.522
Majesty, I have done this for France.

05:20.523 --> 05:22.603
You have gone against France.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.919
Against me!

05:24.907 --> 05:27.807
You are only a minister,
you have no authority.

05:45.683 --> 05:47.663
Goodbye, Louis.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.869
It's my turn now.

05:49.894 --> 05:51.503
DUKE OF LORRAINE: And mine, cousin.

05:51.513 --> 05:53.512
This is our fight.

05:53.513 --> 05:55.563
Thanks to my friend Grimaud's supplies.

05:56.493 --> 05:57.543
Don't forget that.

05:57.553 --> 05:58.643
I do not forget.

05:58.653 --> 06:00.483
But he is not family.

06:02.473 --> 06:05.025
Now we must decide the
right moment for our attack.

06:11.583 --> 06:12.983
PORTHOS: I don't want to hear this!

06:13.553 --> 06:15.513
The time is now.

06:16.473 --> 06:17.502
PORTHOS: Why?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.971
The queen is alone,
surrounded by enemies.

06:19.996 --> 06:22.523
That's your main concern?
The queen is lonely.

06:23.297 --> 06:24.538
That's not what I meant.

06:24.563 --> 06:28.896
Aramis, the queen is alive
and the king is dead.

06:29.493 --> 06:31.888
Our enemies are taking aim.
We need to deal with that.

06:34.683 --> 06:37.842
Louis is dead.
The king is very much alive.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.533
And I intend to keep it that way.

06:39.543 --> 06:41.533
I'm not having this
conversation. Not now.

06:42.172 --> 06:43.488
When you get to the palace,

06:43.513 --> 06:44.951
will you ask
the queen if I can visit her?

06:44.976 --> 06:47.056
I don't think we'll be going
anywhere near the queen.

06:48.483 --> 06:49.523
Constance!

06:58.788 --> 07:00.738
I've been ordered to hide him in Paris.

07:01.366 --> 07:03.356
Come inside. Quickly.

07:09.141 --> 07:10.712
You look better.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.623
Why has the queen given you her son?

07:23.633 --> 07:25.227
Not the queen, Treville.

07:25.252 --> 07:27.512
Gaston's army has reached
the outskirts of Paris.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.473
Well, this is the first
place they'll look for him.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.276
- Then where?
- The settlement.

07:31.301 --> 07:34.211
No, there's too many
people who'd betray him.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.623
There's a better place,

07:36.633 --> 07:39.003
but he's going
to need different clothes.

07:45.513 --> 07:47.523
There. That's more like it.

07:51.967 --> 07:55.897
We are here for the formal
reading of the king's will.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.754
The king...

08:05.137 --> 08:08.855
revoked the choice
of Your Majesty as regent.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.513
It was ratified
in secret by the council.

08:15.573 --> 08:18.463
This is an outrage!

08:18.473 --> 08:19.800
I am a senior member of this council

08:19.825 --> 08:21.492
and I was not aware of this.

08:21.493 --> 08:22.623
Why have you kept this from me?

08:22.633 --> 08:24.573
Because, Minister Treville,

08:24.583 --> 08:27.563
he has made you regent.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.573
What?

08:29.583 --> 08:30.778
This cannot be.

08:30.803 --> 08:33.663
Majesty, it was
the king's final command.

08:33.673 --> 08:36.513
Since France is at war with Spain,

08:36.523 --> 08:38.269
the country of your birth,

08:38.294 --> 08:41.553
he believed it would be
safer to appoint a soldier.

08:50.684 --> 08:52.050
Get out of my way!

09:00.523 --> 09:02.602
BELLAVOIX: For someone
of little personal ambition

09:02.603 --> 09:05.493
your rise is a miracle, Treville.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.623
TREVILLE: The king appointed me
so he could punish the queen.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.662
He certainly went against
the natural order of things,

09:10.663 --> 09:12.812
but we found him quite immoveable.

09:12.837 --> 09:15.672
I would have moved
him if I'd known about this.

09:16.165 --> 09:18.115
We find no fault with you, Treville.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.582
I cannot do this
without the council's support.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.583
You have it.

09:24.226 --> 09:25.483
But for the nobility.

09:40.483 --> 09:41.593
Nothing's changed.

09:41.603 --> 09:42.653
Everything has changed.

09:42.663 --> 09:45.493
I need your help now more than ever.

09:45.503 --> 09:46.666
Why isn't Athos with us?

09:49.109 --> 09:51.149
Don't concern yourself with Athos.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.453
You all have a part to play.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.533
I want you to deliver
an order to Marcheaux.

10:01.543 --> 10:03.443
I'm disbanding the Red Guard.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.652
Is that wise when Paris is under attack?

10:09.653 --> 10:12.503
I only want loyal
Frenchmen defending us.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.453
Treville.

10:25.673 --> 10:27.473
Regent?

10:28.533 --> 10:31.503
We did hope you'd take
it like a man, didn't we?

10:31.513 --> 10:33.059
- Hmm, we did.
- We did.

10:33.084 --> 10:34.523
But then again, we knew you wouldn't.

10:34.533 --> 10:38.748
Well, we will drive you
and Treville out of Paris.

10:39.603 --> 10:40.603
(CACKLES)

10:41.683 --> 10:43.473
Guards!

11:02.453 --> 11:05.443
(GROANING)

11:14.483 --> 11:15.633
I had that under control.

11:15.643 --> 11:17.503
Next time I'll just let you die.

11:24.673 --> 11:26.463
(GUNSHOT)

11:31.573 --> 11:34.613
No one will accept Treville as regent.

11:34.623 --> 11:35.872
He's nothing!

11:38.436 --> 11:40.376
(GROANING)

11:40.401 --> 11:42.542
You will hang, you will hang.

11:42.543 --> 11:44.473
I'll see to it that you do.

11:45.553 --> 11:47.683
Something I learned a
from a Spanish prisoner.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.898
Right.

11:49.484 --> 11:53.453
Well, I imagine with that, the thing
is just knowing when to stop.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.398
Very good.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.850
I think this calls for a toast.

11:59.272 --> 12:01.622
PORTHOS: Thank you.
ARAMIS: Long live the king!

12:01.998 --> 12:02.998
D'ARTAGNAN: The king.

12:05.493 --> 12:06.533
ATHOS: And the new regent.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.483
Where have you been?

12:11.503 --> 12:13.443
(GROANS)

12:19.260 --> 12:20.666
Enjoy it while it lasts.

12:22.236 --> 12:23.767
There's an army coming.

12:30.018 --> 12:33.010
How could my brother
have been so stupid?

12:34.102 --> 12:36.161
He has defiled France.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.523
Appointing a commoner as regent.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.684
- Treville!
- Your brother was not a fool.

12:41.168 --> 12:42.776
A Spanish queen is hard to love,

12:42.801 --> 12:44.886
but Treville is a hero to the people.

12:44.911 --> 12:47.231
We take Paris immediately.

12:47.256 --> 12:48.923
There's nothing to stop us.

12:49.663 --> 12:51.513
Will they love you, cousin?

12:52.241 --> 12:53.281
I hope so.

12:53.663 --> 12:56.150
Of course they will!

12:56.175 --> 12:58.643
They will cheer me
when I enter the city.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.914
I will be protector of the king.

13:03.227 --> 13:04.673
And then in a year or two,

13:04.683 --> 13:09.543
the little swine can have a fatal
riding accident or die of typhus.

13:09.553 --> 13:12.603
But my army will hold
the city until you, Gaston,

13:12.613 --> 13:14.523
give me back my title

13:14.533 --> 13:16.573
and full independence for Lorraine.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.619
I will no longer be France's vassal.

13:32.005 --> 13:35.523
In a few years' time, he'll be ordering
his Council to double the price of wheat

13:35.533 --> 13:37.463
and throwing anyone
who protests in jail.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.443
Do you have a problem with this?

13:41.438 --> 13:42.548
No. I don't.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.393
But it's true though.

13:45.299 --> 13:46.919
But you're still young, aren't you?

13:46.944 --> 13:48.864
There's always time for improvement.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.791
There's no sign of life.

14:22.443 --> 14:23.483
CONSTANCE: Careful now.

14:33.663 --> 14:35.781
It's been empty since Christophe left.

14:42.513 --> 14:45.463
We can make it more
comfortable, can't we?

14:48.613 --> 14:51.114
You no longer have a Red Guard.

14:51.139 --> 14:53.731
- The Dauphin...
- Don't tell me.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.839
Regent Treville.

14:58.513 --> 15:00.293
I don't even know who that is.

15:00.318 --> 15:01.963
If the king foresaw these events,

15:01.988 --> 15:04.463
this was the wisest thing he ever did.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.069
Why have I been summoned again?

15:12.563 --> 15:15.512
Your Majesty, I never
wanted this responsibility.

15:15.513 --> 15:17.513
I assumed I would be serving you.

15:17.523 --> 15:18.868
Which I would have done with honour.

15:18.893 --> 15:20.813
Athos, do you know where my son is?

15:28.979 --> 15:31.919
Majesty, the council is waiting.

15:45.705 --> 15:47.593
I will not sign this.

15:47.603 --> 15:50.512
We have all signed, Majesty.

15:50.513 --> 15:53.503
I want Gaston to pay his
last respects to his brother.

15:54.048 --> 15:55.962
I will not pardon Gaston.

15:56.648 --> 15:58.144
He has no respect,

15:58.169 --> 15:59.583
he should still be in the Bastille.

15:59.593 --> 16:00.572
He is coming anyway

16:00.573 --> 16:02.463
and I would rather
have him here in peace

16:02.473 --> 16:03.593
than behind Lorraine's army.

16:08.211 --> 16:11.301
It must have your
signature to make it law.

16:14.653 --> 16:16.483
Please,

16:17.653 --> 16:19.463
trust me.

16:29.390 --> 16:30.852
The world's gone mad.

16:35.483 --> 16:37.483
Do you all hate me so much?

16:48.613 --> 16:50.503
Porthos, Aramis,

16:50.513 --> 16:52.663
take this to the Duke of
Lorraine at his camp.

16:52.673 --> 16:54.523
Are we likely to come out alive?

16:54.533 --> 16:55.926
That's your safe conduct.

16:55.951 --> 16:57.939
- A royal pardon.
- Gaston.

16:57.964 --> 17:00.633
TREVILLE: While you're there, you can get
an idea of the strength of their army.

17:00.643 --> 17:03.689
D'Artagnan, find me a boy.
About six years old.

17:03.714 --> 17:05.416
Isn't that a little
young for a Musketeer?

17:05.442 --> 17:06.362
He's a decoy.

17:06.387 --> 17:08.522
When Gaston comes to the
palace we want him to think

17:08.532 --> 17:10.473
the Dauphin is being sent away.

17:11.443 --> 17:12.483
Can I see him?

17:13.643 --> 17:15.563
Can I visit the queen?

17:15.573 --> 17:17.542
No. You can't.

17:33.613 --> 17:34.895
Cannon.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.860
Heavy cavalry, light cavalry.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.522
Well-armed.

17:39.523 --> 17:41.603
I heard Lorraine's bankrupt.

17:41.613 --> 17:43.513
Who's paying for all this?

17:45.977 --> 17:46.977
Grimaud.

17:55.950 --> 18:01.658
My men are going to slit the throats of
every Musketeer that they come across.

18:03.143 --> 18:06.422
Treville has just handed me
a trained regiment of soldiers

18:06.617 --> 18:08.617
inside the walls of Paris.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.250
Give them money.

18:11.275 --> 18:13.315
The Red Guard work for me now.

18:17.593 --> 18:19.623
Let them have the palace.

18:19.633 --> 18:21.463
We'll control the city.

18:21.488 --> 18:22.488
(GROANS)

18:24.543 --> 18:25.543
(GROANS)

18:42.104 --> 18:45.443
Do you think I want to go near
my brother's stinking corpse?

18:46.294 --> 18:47.990
You dishonour the late king.

18:48.553 --> 18:49.583
(SNEERS)

18:49.593 --> 18:51.473
He's been generous to you.

18:52.418 --> 18:53.588
That's a pardon.

18:53.653 --> 18:57.879
He dishonoured me by making
that dull soldier regent.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.844
The king's will is complex.

19:02.676 --> 19:04.726
Treville believes you will want to see it.

19:06.503 --> 19:07.809
Is there a legacy?

19:09.415 --> 19:11.465
We've been sent here to escort you back.

19:15.523 --> 19:16.523
Leave us.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.532
Obviously, I must go.

19:25.533 --> 19:26.553
No.

19:26.563 --> 19:28.008
This means nothing.

19:28.563 --> 19:30.866
Whatever Louis intended, he's dead.

19:30.891 --> 19:33.320
But this may be good news for all of us.

19:33.345 --> 19:35.503
For you, perhaps.

19:36.623 --> 19:41.054
Cousin, there may be no need
to spill any French blood.

19:41.079 --> 19:42.662
Shall I investigate?

19:42.663 --> 19:44.446
Our fortunes are bound together.

19:44.471 --> 19:48.371
Surely what benefits me
benefits us both.

19:51.573 --> 19:55.553
And besides, I'm a prince of the blood

19:55.563 --> 19:57.503
and no one tells me what to do.

19:59.104 --> 20:00.553
Saddle my horse!

20:09.663 --> 20:11.463
CONSTANCE: Sylvie!

20:21.553 --> 20:23.672
(CHUCKLING) Fit for a boy
at least, if not a king.

20:23.673 --> 20:25.473
I'll fetch him.

20:31.543 --> 20:32.543
Sire?

20:35.633 --> 20:37.573
Where are you hiding?

20:39.348 --> 20:41.398
I bet I can find you.

20:44.563 --> 20:45.563
He's gone!

21:03.623 --> 21:06.453
WOMAN: Oi! What you think you're doing?

21:08.633 --> 21:10.573
Leave him! Leave him!

21:11.251 --> 21:12.797
He's a little thief.

21:12.822 --> 21:14.836
- He was hungry.
- Yeah? Ain't we all?

21:14.861 --> 21:16.001
We can pay you.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.553
He was filling his pockets.

21:17.563 --> 21:19.513
Look, here, take this...

21:21.573 --> 21:22.851
Oi! Over here!

21:22.876 --> 21:25.282
Come on! Arrest this lot, will you?

21:25.307 --> 21:26.954
It's okay. We need to leave.

21:27.485 --> 21:29.497
WOMAN: Oi! Over here!

21:30.215 --> 21:31.387
Arrest these lot.

21:31.412 --> 21:32.593
Just keep moving.

21:32.603 --> 21:33.623
I'll think of something.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.263
Regent Treville.

21:51.741 --> 21:54.096
I knew my brother
would finally pardon me.

21:54.363 --> 21:55.363
He didn't.

21:56.263 --> 21:57.739
The pardon is mine.

21:57.764 --> 21:59.767
And I suppose the legacy is yours too.

21:59.792 --> 22:00.842
There is no legacy.

22:02.453 --> 22:04.403
This is a trick?

22:04.413 --> 22:09.273
I intend to see the new
king through to his maturity

22:09.283 --> 22:12.423
and to make France
peaceful and prosperous.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.863
I will do my best to ensure the
king loves and respects you.

22:16.873 --> 22:20.773
And, of course, there is always the
possibility of ascending to the throne

22:20.783 --> 22:22.187
if he dies childless.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.803
That would be too long a wait.

22:27.477 --> 22:29.387
What do I get now?

22:29.412 --> 22:31.723
I'm told you admire
the Luxembourg Palace.

22:33.863 --> 22:35.186
Moderately.

22:35.211 --> 22:39.608
I can also guarantee a generous
stipend from the exchequer

22:40.793 --> 22:42.783
in keeping with your high status.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.216
Why? You all hate me.

22:45.393 --> 22:47.413
I want France united,

22:47.423 --> 22:49.563
with all of its nobles
loyal to the new king

22:49.573 --> 22:51.433
and free of conspirators.

22:53.473 --> 22:57.353
It's in my interests
to make you happy, Gaston.

22:57.363 --> 22:58.383
Not now, Captain.

22:58.393 --> 23:00.373
I'm sorry. The queen is distressed.

23:00.383 --> 23:01.413
The king is unwell.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.363
- I must go to him.
- No!

23:04.921 --> 23:05.961
I am family!

23:05.986 --> 23:07.866
This is not the time, Gaston.

23:08.443 --> 23:09.932
Later, perhaps.

23:33.493 --> 23:37.171
If they took the armouries to the east of
Paris we'd be hard pushed to stop them.

23:37.196 --> 23:38.443
That's what I feared.

23:38.453 --> 23:40.357
Put the garrison on standby.

23:40.358 --> 23:41.438
Is the boy D'Artagnan found ready?

23:41.463 --> 23:43.533
Yes, we've dressed his
mother as a lady in waiting.

23:43.543 --> 23:45.225
See she's well paid.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.359
Aramis, make sure Gaston takes the bait.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.443
Porthos, come with me.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.859
I'm going to talk peace
with the Duke of Lorraine.

23:59.698 --> 24:03.628
You couldn't make your mind
up about me, could you, Louis?

24:05.483 --> 24:10.433
"Oh, Gaston, Gaston,
you let me down again.

24:11.498 --> 24:13.538
"Oh, Gaston, now I forgive you."

24:17.473 --> 24:18.473
Well...

24:20.592 --> 24:23.502
It's too late for forgiveness.

24:24.543 --> 24:26.563
It's my turn now

24:26.573 --> 24:31.363
and Paris will run with blood
if anyone tries to stop me!

24:38.784 --> 24:40.372
I'm tired.

24:40.849 --> 24:42.719
I want to go to my room.

24:42.744 --> 24:44.744
- I'll show you.
- I know where it is.

25:24.563 --> 25:26.373
(HORSE NEIGHING)

25:26.383 --> 25:27.823
ATHOS: We must hurry, Your Highness.

25:55.423 --> 25:59.863
Your Majesty, I'm so sorry.

26:00.573 --> 26:02.453
I thought you were Gaston.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.677
For the brief time he's here,

26:06.702 --> 26:07.919
I don't want to set eyes on him.

26:07.944 --> 26:09.408
He is in the Dauphin's quarters.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.343
Treville's plan has worked.

26:11.523 --> 26:13.363
Gaston believes

26:14.473 --> 26:18.343
your son has been
taken out of Paris to safety.

26:18.850 --> 26:19.850
Where is he truly?

26:23.733 --> 26:24.763
Please tell me you know.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.547
(HESITATING) I don't...

26:27.572 --> 26:28.572
Of course.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.900
They haven't told you either.

26:35.513 --> 26:38.433
Treville took him
the very moment the king died.

26:39.563 --> 26:41.353
Who's with him?

26:41.363 --> 26:42.433
I hoped it was you.

26:46.393 --> 26:47.789
I'm so frightened for him.

26:52.563 --> 26:54.423
Your Majesty,

26:56.728 --> 26:59.608
we are united in our grief.

27:00.898 --> 27:02.828
Don't you dare speak to me.

27:08.423 --> 27:11.353
I want Treville.
I need to talk with him.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.453
He's gone.

27:12.463 --> 27:15.453
To talk with the Duke of Lorraine.

27:52.423 --> 27:54.343
He didn't jump at your offer.

27:54.353 --> 27:55.561
What makes you think Lorraine will?

27:55.586 --> 27:58.418
I cannot and will not give
Gaston what he wants,

27:58.443 --> 28:00.373
but Lorraine's a different matter.

28:05.443 --> 28:06.523
Brave.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.015
To come here.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.781
I heard you were an honourable man.

28:09.806 --> 28:12.403
Why isn't Prince Gaston with you?

28:12.413 --> 28:14.111
Don't worry. We haven't killed him.

28:14.413 --> 28:15.413
Yet.

28:16.543 --> 28:19.393
He's perfectly safe, Your Grace.

28:20.393 --> 28:22.483
I'm here to negotiate with you.

28:22.827 --> 28:23.876
But not that man.

28:23.901 --> 28:26.553
He's wanted for the murder
of the Marquis de Feron.

28:26.563 --> 28:29.463
You speak with us both or leave.

28:29.754 --> 28:31.774
I will hear what he's come to say.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.393
Where is he being hidden? Tell me.

28:55.403 --> 28:57.423
You were keeping an eye on Gaston.

28:57.433 --> 28:59.342
He'll be back at Lorraine's camp by now.

28:59.374 --> 29:02.041
I'd like to know what's
happened to the Dauphin.

29:04.124 --> 29:06.099
Don't play games with me, Athos.

29:06.124 --> 29:07.543
Where is he?

29:07.951 --> 29:10.911
It's better you don't know, Aramis.

29:16.393 --> 29:17.969
You came back too quickly.

29:17.979 --> 29:19.158
I know he must still be in Paris.

29:19.183 --> 29:22.203
He is being well cared for
by people we know and trust.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.432
Who do you trust to look
after the King of France?

29:24.433 --> 29:27.423
I'd like to know
if I agree with your choice.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.513
What happened to "one for all"?

29:38.513 --> 29:40.402
You want your lands back

29:40.403 --> 29:43.413
and a treaty guaranteeing Lorraine's
independence from France.

29:43.423 --> 29:45.493
France has no right to them.

29:45.778 --> 29:47.778
Louis took them by force and deception.

29:47.803 --> 29:51.433
Because of your years of plotting
with Gaston against the king.

29:51.443 --> 29:52.478
(LAUGHS WRYLY)

29:52.479 --> 29:56.358
And here I am plotting with
Gaston to take them back.

29:56.383 --> 29:58.680
You have an army
stretched fighting Spain.

29:58.705 --> 30:00.482
Chaos and hunger at home.

30:00.483 --> 30:04.393
When your men came here they had
enough time to assess my forces.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.543
They'll have told you, I'm sure,

30:07.044 --> 30:11.034
that I can take Paris before you can
bring reinforcements from the war.

30:12.663 --> 30:14.713
How much do you trust your generals?

30:15.645 --> 30:17.120
It will be bloody.

30:17.145 --> 30:19.453
They will be slaughtering
their own countrymen.

30:19.463 --> 30:22.393
You know you cannot
fully rely on their loyalty.

30:23.543 --> 30:25.383
If you send your troops home,

30:25.393 --> 30:27.218
we will consider reinstating Lorraine

30:27.243 --> 30:29.200
as a fully independent province

30:29.225 --> 30:31.245
within France's borders.

30:38.443 --> 30:40.981
Looks like Lorraine doesn't need you.

30:43.513 --> 30:45.353
They all need me.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.403
They need my gold to
back up their big ambitions.

30:49.413 --> 30:50.553
They'll throw you back in the sewer

30:50.563 --> 30:52.413
once they've got what they want.

30:52.423 --> 30:54.523
But the nobility never
stop wanting, do they?

30:54.533 --> 30:57.433
Never satisfied, born greedy.

30:57.443 --> 31:00.463
And here you are,
desperate to be one of them.

31:01.553 --> 31:03.343
(SCOFFS)

31:06.815 --> 31:08.620
End your alliance with Gaston.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.817
I have made him
an offer of reconciliation.

31:11.842 --> 31:14.281
It's a generous one, which
I believe he will accept.

31:16.453 --> 31:18.423
I can't betray my cousin.

31:18.433 --> 31:22.170
He will have everything
he wants, bar the throne.

31:22.195 --> 31:25.205
And if he gets that, he will betray you.

31:25.230 --> 31:28.764
We both know he will
not let the new king live.

31:35.423 --> 31:37.403
I need time to consider your offer.

31:39.403 --> 31:42.433
At dusk, when the first candles are lit,

31:43.740 --> 31:45.740
our offer to you will be withdrawn.

31:54.423 --> 31:55.914
SYLVIE: How long has it been empty?

31:55.939 --> 31:57.779
CONSTANCE: A long time.

31:59.473 --> 32:02.006
It's where I lived with my late husband.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.413
I never would have imagined
the king sleeping here.

32:28.543 --> 32:30.393
This is how I met D'Artagnan.

32:31.523 --> 32:33.393
He rented this room.

32:33.573 --> 32:35.363
That was his bed.

32:38.303 --> 32:39.303
Sylvie,

32:41.473 --> 32:43.473
I need to tell Athos we've moved him.

32:54.553 --> 32:56.147
Has Treville gone?

32:56.172 --> 32:58.222
He's waiting.
We're to meet again at dusk.

32:59.230 --> 33:00.400
He has tricked me.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.819
He lured me to the palace for nothing.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.949
Nothing?

33:05.832 --> 33:08.002
No generous offer? No reconciliation?

33:08.027 --> 33:09.383
No legacy?

33:10.351 --> 33:12.735
Absolutely nothing.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.483
What has he said to you?

33:18.493 --> 33:20.433
What has he offered you?

33:21.433 --> 33:22.443
Nothing.

33:23.739 --> 33:25.189
He's sent the Dauphin away.

33:25.214 --> 33:28.383
I saw Athos and D'Artagnan
put him in a fast coach.

33:28.393 --> 33:30.860
They were loading
provisions for a long journey.

33:34.977 --> 33:36.837
I will be king!

33:40.373 --> 33:42.373
We must march on Paris now.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.343
I'm not ready.

33:56.198 --> 33:58.277
We'll get nothing here.

33:58.443 --> 34:01.393
Treville is manoeuvring Lorraine
to cut me out of any deal.

34:02.084 --> 34:03.363
His plan is to divide us

34:03.373 --> 34:05.413
and Gaston is too stupid to see it.

34:07.353 --> 34:08.513
Then what are we waiting for?

34:09.443 --> 34:11.013
The army is ready for battle.

34:11.038 --> 34:14.047
We have no army
without Lorraine leading it.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.402
We need the Dauphin.

34:19.413 --> 34:21.600
Gaston thinks
they've sent him out of Paris

34:21.625 --> 34:23.402
but Treville wouldn't take such a risk.

34:24.443 --> 34:25.735
He won't be at the palace,

34:25.760 --> 34:27.760
not with an army
waiting to descend on them.

34:32.453 --> 34:34.443
Where would you hide the Dauphin?

34:36.203 --> 34:38.422
Who would you have look after him?

34:38.433 --> 34:40.483
Treville only trusts Musketeers

34:40.493 --> 34:42.342
and Porthos is here.

34:42.533 --> 34:44.433
Look for the others.

34:44.443 --> 34:46.839
One of them will lead you to the boy.

34:53.911 --> 34:55.170
I need to find Athos.

34:55.195 --> 34:56.473
He's at the palace.

34:56.483 --> 34:58.811
But there's someone in
his office waiting to see you.

35:06.433 --> 35:07.542
Your Majesty.

35:07.744 --> 35:09.634
The king. I'm so sorry...

35:09.659 --> 35:12.343
When I found out it wasn't
Aramis, I knew it must be you.

35:13.553 --> 35:15.443
- Your Majesty...
- You have him.

35:18.463 --> 35:20.543
Even before I found these, I knew.

35:20.553 --> 35:24.383
How could you carry out
their plan without asking me?

35:24.393 --> 35:26.585
Because I know it's right.

35:26.610 --> 35:28.530
You will take me to him now.

35:30.020 --> 35:32.423
And that is a command from your queen.

35:32.433 --> 35:34.343
Treville orders me to hide him

35:34.353 --> 35:36.373
and you order me to put that at risk.

35:46.121 --> 35:47.871
I could take him to prayers.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.364
The church at Saint-Sulpice.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.530
If you hide yourself, I'll
bring him there in an hour.

35:55.877 --> 36:00.757
On my life, you must keep your
distance and he cannot see you.

36:21.252 --> 36:22.835
We have work to do!

36:22.860 --> 36:24.650
(ALL CHATTERING)

36:25.583 --> 36:27.373

36:38.523 --> 36:39.523

36:45.230 --> 36:49.380
We are going to hunt Musketeers.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.200
Athos,

36:54.732 --> 36:55.732
Aramis

36:58.197 --> 36:59.237
and D'Artagnan.

37:01.483 --> 37:03.413
I know where to find Porthos.

37:04.489 --> 37:05.529
He's as good as dead.

37:22.793 --> 37:25.733
There couldn't have been
a worse time for Louis to die.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.873
I think he held on to his life
for as long as he could,

37:27.883 --> 37:29.693
for his son.

37:30.853 --> 37:32.730
Who is in hiding somewhere...

37:34.214 --> 37:35.550
with someone.

37:39.823 --> 37:41.643
- Athos?
- He was right.

37:43.710 --> 37:45.087
- What do you mean?
- Aramis.

37:45.119 --> 37:47.783
One for all. All this secrecy is wrong.

37:50.853 --> 37:53.693
So who has him now?

37:55.563 --> 37:56.573
Constance.

37:57.863 --> 37:59.334
Constance?

38:06.499 --> 38:07.549
He's still resting.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.704
What is it?

38:10.823 --> 38:12.733
I have to take him to Saint-Sulpice.

38:13.703 --> 38:14.783
It's too dangerous.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.177
The queen has commanded me.
She was at the garrison.

38:17.202 --> 38:18.469
Constance!

38:20.557 --> 38:21.617
I have no choice.

38:22.665 --> 38:23.810
I'll be quick.

38:56.339 --> 38:58.358
SYLVIE: Aramis! Where's Athos?

38:58.383 --> 39:00.492
- I don't know.
- Come on, I need your help.

39:03.833 --> 39:04.863
Where are they?

39:04.873 --> 39:06.663
- Where?
- Saint-Sulpice!

39:15.533 --> 39:16.773
Remember your prayers?

39:26.649 --> 39:27.739
(DOOR OPENING)

39:39.898 --> 39:41.116
Constance!

39:41.570 --> 39:43.033
They've got the king.

39:43.058 --> 39:44.398
Stop them.

40:00.703 --> 40:03.037
More men will be coming.
You should never have brought him here.

40:03.062 --> 40:04.720
I commanded her to.

40:07.803 --> 40:10.257
Do you realise how close
we were to losing him?

40:10.282 --> 40:11.332
I'm sorry.

40:11.823 --> 40:12.823
(SIGHS)

40:13.813 --> 40:15.663
I might have done the same.

40:16.813 --> 40:17.853
We were lucky.

40:17.863 --> 40:19.753
I know you are watching over us.

40:19.823 --> 40:20.823
Always.

40:22.803 --> 40:23.803
I hope.

40:24.873 --> 40:26.663
I hope so too.

40:26.823 --> 40:28.663
Truly, Aramis.

40:29.546 --> 40:32.436
Go. We will protect you.

40:36.188 --> 40:38.328
- Is your hiding place nearby?
- No.

40:38.823 --> 40:42.352
He'll have his men
swarming all over this area.

40:42.377 --> 40:44.773
When he was ill as a baby
I brought him to a laundry.

40:45.571 --> 40:47.883
I know a back way. We shouldn't be seen.

40:48.136 --> 40:50.025
They're good women there,

40:50.050 --> 40:52.070
but we'll need your protection.

40:52.573 --> 40:53.986
You find the others.

40:54.011 --> 40:55.276
I can't leave you.

40:55.301 --> 40:56.510
You have to.

40:56.873 --> 40:58.773
I'll look after him. I promise.

41:05.843 --> 41:07.199
It's nearly time.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.823
I must talk to Lorraine alone.

41:10.445 --> 41:11.853
I'm giving you authority

41:11.863 --> 41:14.656
to offer Gaston an even greater fortune

41:15.365 --> 41:17.843
and joint control of the army.

41:21.216 --> 41:22.783
Just get him away.

41:28.327 --> 41:29.677
What do you want from me?

41:32.361 --> 41:33.763
No more secrecy!

41:37.454 --> 41:39.984
The regent didn't want to embarrass
you in front of your allies.

41:40.009 --> 41:41.823
- Another trick.
- No. No.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.773
Treville realises his earlier offer

41:43.783 --> 41:46.845
fell short of your rightful
status and expectations.

41:47.446 --> 41:50.282
He will put aside ten million
livres from the royal reserve

41:50.307 --> 41:52.723
if you will accept
his offer of reconciliation.

41:53.453 --> 41:56.463
You can tell the so-called
regent that when I am king,

41:56.488 --> 41:58.518
it will all be mine anyway.

41:58.543 --> 42:00.323
And...

42:07.491 --> 42:09.813
He will make you joint head of the army.

42:15.237 --> 42:17.686
I will consider further concessions

42:18.221 --> 42:20.725
if you pull your armies back.

42:21.773 --> 42:22.802
Immediately.

42:22.803 --> 42:24.097
(SMIRKS)

42:24.253 --> 42:26.081
And then have you withdraw your offer?

42:27.243 --> 42:29.243
I, too, am a man of honour.

42:30.243 --> 42:32.293
It is about the imminence of the threat.

42:32.303 --> 42:35.845
If you pull them back just ten
leagues to the River Marne,

42:35.870 --> 42:36.870
I will draft a treaty.

42:38.615 --> 42:40.027
Why would I do this?

42:40.052 --> 42:42.699
A gesture, an act of conciliation.

42:43.899 --> 42:47.004
Then we could try one more
time to reach an agreement.

43:03.133 --> 43:05.133
ATHOS: I should have told you
everything from the start.

43:05.158 --> 43:06.921
No. I wasn't thinking straight,

43:06.946 --> 43:08.476
I might've put the boy in danger.

43:08.501 --> 43:09.600
But you didn't.

43:09.625 --> 43:11.674
Gentlemen, as happy as I am
that we're all friends again,

43:11.699 --> 43:13.735
- can I go and help my wife now?
- Go.

43:14.367 --> 43:15.497
We need to stop Marcheaux.

43:19.413 --> 43:22.343
You had the king and you lost him!

43:24.423 --> 43:26.563
Without a scratch on you!

43:27.323 --> 43:32.383
We know he's in Saint Antoine,
now, with D'Artagnan's whore.

43:32.393 --> 43:35.323
I have men crawling all over the place.

43:36.393 --> 43:38.155
Lorraine wants to make peace.

43:39.022 --> 43:41.007
He didn't have the stomach
for the fight.

43:42.944 --> 43:45.457
I'll use the young king
to raise Gaston up

43:45.489 --> 43:47.818
and destroy their precious treaty.

43:49.231 --> 43:52.221
Now search every house!

44:04.344 --> 44:06.007
You both look exhausted.

44:08.189 --> 44:09.483
Who's the boy?

44:11.672 --> 44:13.682
There's more for you
if we can keep him safe here.

44:15.353 --> 44:18.493
Well, he must be important if you've
brought a Musketeer with you.

44:18.503 --> 44:20.333
Oh, he's her husband.

44:20.343 --> 44:21.353
Times are hard.

44:21.363 --> 44:23.115
Just bring us more work
from the garrison.

44:23.140 --> 44:24.950
You have my word.

44:25.533 --> 44:28.373
- All right. Sure?
- Sorry.

44:28.383 --> 44:30.393
I would have told you sooner,
but Athos made me promise.

44:30.403 --> 44:32.513
And he was right to.
I would have done the same.

44:32.523 --> 44:34.493
There are Red Guards everywhere.

44:34.744 --> 44:36.910
Now, can you find us a hiding place?

44:40.680 --> 44:41.690
Yes!

44:44.887 --> 44:46.767
This will work.

44:47.474 --> 44:49.247
You need to leave immediately.

If they come here
you'll both be recognised.

Very quietly now, okay? Don't worry.

45:22.770 --> 45:25.685
I warned you, didn't I?

45:26.373 --> 45:28.854
Disbanding the Red Guard was a bad idea.

45:28.879 --> 45:30.043
Was it?

45:30.068 --> 45:32.473
I don't think so.
We get paid to kill traitors.

grovel at the king's feet.

What is it?

47:11.295 --> 47:12.355
Superstition

47:14.741 --> 47:16.591
or stupidity?

I've got a little test
of loyalty which is...

is fighting for is lost.

they ratify full
independence for Lorraine.
