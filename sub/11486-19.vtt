WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.313
Can't we just go home?

00:03.520 --> 00:06.080
If I gotta drag you to the doctor
at 8 in the morning...

00:06.240 --> 00:08.276
...you can cool your jets
while I get coffee.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.839
I must look like an idiot.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.553
Wish I could tell you different.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.797
You're the reason we went
to the eye doctor in the first place.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.877
You said,
"Throw me a piece of toast."

00:18.840 --> 00:20.432
I threw you a piece of toast.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.992
Two cups of regular coffee, please.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.200
- My treat.
- Oh, that makes up for everything.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.591
Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket,
but I get a free cup of coffee.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.993
Just the coffee. Keep the change.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.948
I'm gonna need your help
until I get this patch off.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.594
I am absolutely there for you.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.357
Great.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.708
Great. So...

00:48.880 --> 00:51.713
So you'll drive me to work,
pick me up, get Jake at school...

00:51.920 --> 00:54.639
...do the grocery shopping...
- Okay, I may have misspoken.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.190
Charlie, you have to.
You know I can't drive.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.834
I don't see why not.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.076
- Oh, look who's here.
- Who?

01:09.520 --> 01:11.829
A girl I used to go out with.
Over there.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.199
Hey, Sherri.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.352
- Hey, Charlie, long time.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.112
- This is my brother, Alan.
- Hi.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.952
- Hi.
- What happened to your eye?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.755
Well, I wanted
a piece of toast, and...

01:23.920 --> 01:25.558
Bar fight.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.916
- Nice to meet you.
- Well, nice meeting you too.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.759
- Good to see you, Charlie.
- Good to see you too.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.910
- Wow, you went out with her?
- Yep.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.116
Why would you stop?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.590
I don't remember.
I probably got bored.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.512
Bored? How do you
get bored with that?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.632
For every beautiful woman,
there's at least one guy out there...

01:45.800 --> 01:49.429
...who's tired of pretending to listen
to her in exchange for sex.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.832
Well, let me go on record as saying,
I am not that guy.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.873
If I ever had a woman like that,
I would cherish her.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.473
I would worship her. I would...

01:57.640 --> 02:01.315
...start a small country and put her
face on a stamp so I could lick her head.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.676
- Why don't you go talk to her.
- Yeah, right.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.957
Gorgeous women like that are
not interested in pasty guys like me...

02:08.120 --> 02:10.235
...unless we're in line
for the British throne.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.196
- So you give up without even trying?
- Yep. That's my motto.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.836
Why waste time on 10s when you're
already getting rejected by sixes?

02:18.400 --> 02:22.359
Alan, listen to me. You are a smart,
sensitive, good-Iooking man...

02:22.520 --> 02:24.909
...with some milky discharge
coming out of one eye...

02:25.080 --> 02:26.752
...but who amongst us is perfect?

02:26.960 --> 02:29.110
That's the other thing.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.710
So? Women like Sherri have big,
hunky guys hitting on them all day long.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.111
A guy like you walks up, makes a move,
you know what that says to her?

02:36.760 --> 02:38.079
Trick or treat?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.832
It says, "I'm confident in who I am."

02:43.040 --> 02:45.031
- You think?
- I know.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.397
So, what if she's not interested.
What's the worst that could happen?

02:48.560 --> 02:51.870
Actually, the worst that could happen
is she points at me...

02:52.040 --> 02:55.350
...and laughs, causing every
seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn...

02:55.520 --> 02:57.636
...and watch me slink back
to the geek table...

02:57.800 --> 03:00.189
...with a growing wet spot
on the front of my chinos.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.278
We ninth graders enjoyed it also.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.837
But you're not in junior high anymore,
and you're not a...

03:07.600 --> 03:09.750
You're not in junior high anymore.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.309
- It's time to let go of those fears.
- I don't know.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.708
Oh, come on, Alan.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.435
For once in your life, don't settle.
Go for what you really want.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.872
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.793
Hold on.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.632
Let's clean some of that discharge.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.034
You wanna say "I'm confident,"
not "I'm infectious."

03:32.960 --> 03:34.279
There. Go get her.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.798
Hey, you see that guy over there?
Twenty bucks says he wets himself.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.470
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.676
- Alan?
- I remember.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.920
Look, I needed to come clean
about something.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.157
I wasn't actually in a bar fight.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.278
I took a piece of whole-wheat toast
to the eye.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.399
I mean, it was cut diagonally
and toasted well...

04:20.560 --> 04:22.391
...so it was essentially shrapnel.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.552
Did some real damage.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.275
I see. And why do you feel the need
to tell me all this?

04:30.480 --> 04:33.677
Well, I guess I didn't want
our relationship to start on a lie.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.552
Our relationship?

04:36.280 --> 04:38.157
- I'll go now.
- No, no, wait.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.673
Sit down. Join me.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.714
Okay.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.554
- That's it. I'm out.
- Oh, come on.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.514
No, no, no. No more.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.312
You got a date. Leave it alone.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.556
Not just a date. A date with...

05:27.080 --> 05:28.672
Enough.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.400
- I'd think you'd be happy for me.
- I am happy for you.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.152
You had the courage to walk over...

05:33.320 --> 05:35.880
...with your pus-filled eye
and fall on your ass...

05:36.040 --> 05:40.192
...and still got a date with one of
the most beautiful women I've ever met.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.794
- I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud.
- Thank you.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.594
Now, I have to re-evaluate
everything I thought I knew...

05:45.760 --> 05:49.070
...about men, women, relationships,
God and the universe.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.116
But that's not your problem.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.272
Charlie, I am as surprised as you
that she said yes.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.433
I don't think so.

05:58.080 --> 06:02.153
I was really intimidated, but as it turns
out, she's just like a regular person...

06:02.320 --> 06:05.915
...except for, you know,
being from the planet:

06:07.640 --> 06:10.200
Alan, never do that around me again.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.350
You know, actually,
we have a lot in common.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.477
Okay. I'll bite.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.671
Well, we both went through
tough divorces.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.996
- Sherri was married?
- You didn't know that?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.674
- It never came up.
- What did come up?

06:23.840 --> 06:25.273
Never mind. Scratch that.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.473
Where should
I take her to dinner?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.069
Where did you go
so I can take her somewhere else?

06:30.280 --> 06:33.272
Last thing you want is for her
to start comparing you to me.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.391
Exactly.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.516
Wait.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.954
What do you mean?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.796
You want your relationship
to stand on its own.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.355
- Right.
- Well, that's what I meant.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.792
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub
my nose in the fact that you dated her.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.356
Alan, I would never do that.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.073
Well, thank you.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.956
I don't have to.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.949
You think you could kill a guy
with a piece of toast?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.348
No.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.710
Because if you did,
you could eat the toast.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.758
The police would never find the
weapon. It's the perfect crime.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.872
And part of a nutritious breakfast.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.072
Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.753
Where you going?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.353
- Out for dinner.
- With who?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.759
Jake, look, I think...

07:23.920 --> 07:26.912
I think you're old enough to know
that your dad's not just a dad.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.554
He's also a man and that...

07:29.760 --> 07:31.830
...even though I'm not married
to your mom...

07:32.040 --> 07:34.838
...I still enjoy the company of women...

07:35.000 --> 07:38.390
...which means that I will
occasionally go out with one.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.398
But the important thing
for you to understand...

07:41.600 --> 07:44.353
...is that I am not trying to
replace your mother.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.080
In fact, no one
can replace your mother.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.956
I bet you could kill a guy
with a piece of bacon.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.350
All right, then.
I'm glad we had this talk.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.918
I'm gonna go post my plan
on the Internet.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.751
You know, there's moments
around here...

08:03.920 --> 08:06.514
...that make me wish
I had a son of my own.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.159
That wasn't one of them.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.630
Yeah, well. Anyway, I really
appreciate you watching him tonight.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.028
No problem.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.959
- How you getting to the restaurant?
- Sherri's picking me up.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.472
- Very convenient.
- Why?

08:21.640 --> 08:23.949
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?

08:24.120 --> 08:27.192
Because you've had sex with her
in every room in the house?

08:27.360 --> 08:28.839
No, because you can't drive.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.515
But it's interesting to see
how your mind works.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.756
Alan, let me give you some advice.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.837
Alcohol impairs your ability
to make good decisions.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.037
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.075
Of course. Very good.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.514
What else?

08:52.720 --> 08:55.996
Well, women like Sherri already know
they're beautiful and desirable.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.958
- You won't score points by telling her.
- Okay.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.872
Don't be in a hurry
to spill your guts.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.672
She doesn't need your life story...

09:02.840 --> 09:04.637
...before you get the salad.
- Got it.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.037
As someone who knows your life story,
I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.231
Right, right.
I'll be cool, aloof, distant.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.560
She's here, she's here, she's here!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.150
What about the... What... What...

09:22.800 --> 09:24.199
What about the kiss goodnight?

09:24.360 --> 09:26.476
- Should I ask or just go for it?
- Go for it.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.108
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.157
- Get it out of the way early.
- How early?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.271
After dinner,
when you walk to the car...

09:33.440 --> 09:35.829
...open her door, wait for her
to say thank you...

09:36.000 --> 09:38.230
...smile, lean in, and kiss her.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.471
Oh, nice.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.072
Hi, Alan. You ready?

09:49.440 --> 09:52.989
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.715
That's another way to go.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.950
- Madam.
- Thank you.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.194
- Sir.
- Oh, thank you.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.872
- Would you like the wine list?
- No.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.918
I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir.
Or should we get a bottle?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.391
Oh, definitely get a bottle.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.791
Coffee for me.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.511
You know, Sherri, I'd really like
to see more of you.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.915
Maybe we should wait
and see how tonight goes.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.157
No, I mean, I've only got one good eye.
Could we change places?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.718
Oh, sure.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.278
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yes, yes. Fine.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.277
- This is a nice place.
- Yeah.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.708
It's my favorite.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.158
You ever come here with Charlie?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.553
I don't know. Probably.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.473
He's a big steak-eater.

11:03.800 --> 11:08.078
I'm more of a fish guy.
You know, I'm surf, he's turf.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.830
And we're cops.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.034
- You're very cute.
- You too.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.755
All right.
So tell me about yourself.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.073
Well, there's not a lot to tell.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.629
I was San Fernando Valley
Chiropractor of the Year...

11:25.800 --> 11:27.438
...if you follow that kind of thing.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.039
Recently divorced.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.279
But not too recently. I've already had
my rebound, transitional relationships.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.431
- So no worries there.
- Good to know.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.790
Actually, it wasn't so much
a relationship...

11:37.960 --> 11:42.317
...as a case of mistaken identity,
but I think it still counts.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.592
- Okay.
- And...

11:44.800 --> 11:47.872
...as you know, I live with Charlie...

11:48.040 --> 11:49.837
...whom you've already...

11:50.720 --> 11:52.790
- Met?
- Yeah, let's go with met.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.793
Alan, is my having dated Charlie
gonna be a problem for you?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.471
No, no, no. A little.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.794
Okay, look. Charlie and l...

12:04.960 --> 12:08.111
We had a very brief,
superficial relationship.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.510
Okay? And to be honest,
it was mostly about sex.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.673
Great.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.269
My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those,
those shallow relationships...

12:17.440 --> 12:19.431
...I was having with guys like Charlie.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.195
I wanna be with a man who can be
sensitive and caring, nurturing.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.909
You know, somebody who can
make me laugh, make me think.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.870
You do realize I'm straight, right?

12:32.360 --> 12:35.397
- See, you really are adorable.
- Thank you.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.949
I tend to bring out
the mothering instinct in women.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.720
- Oh, really?
- Ironically, not my mother.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.074
What the hell are you doing?

13:08.280 --> 13:11.033
Check it out. Ninja death toast.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.838
Okay, stop it, stop it.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.270
You're in no position
to give orders, Mr. Harper.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.514
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.434
- Death toast?
- Oh, thank you.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.549
- So how did it go last night?
- Fine.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.034
That's it? Fine?

13:34.240 --> 13:37.755
Charlie, we're not in high school
anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.270
- Okay, don't tell me.
- Jake, go watch TV.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.759
- I'm still hungry.
- There's bread all over the living room.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.594
All right.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.039
- Well?
- It went great.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.397
She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'm
nurturing, caring and sensitive.

13:53.560 --> 13:57.155
- I'm exactly what she's looking for.
- She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.468
She invited me to her house
for dinner tonight.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.791
- I think she wants to have sex.
- With who?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.468
- With me.
- With you.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.755
Hang on a second.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.320
Nope. No snowballs reported in hell.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.195
No sightings of flying pigs.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.830
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't know?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.036
Come on, Alan,
you were married for 12 years.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.549
What does marriage
have to do with sex?

14:25.720 --> 14:28.314
Point taken.
Okay, you want some tips?

14:28.520 --> 14:31.034
No, no, nothing like that.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.916
I need step-by-step instructions.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.392
All right. Since this is your
first bout in this weight class...

14:37.560 --> 14:39.278
...I'd say stick with the basics.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.950
Better to do the simple stuff well
than the fancy stuff badly.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.509
Got it.
And the simple stuff would be...

14:46.280 --> 14:49.192
Well, you know how women
like you to go slow?

14:49.400 --> 14:53.029
Really? My ex-wife put
a premium on brevity.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.432
Her motto was, " Less is more,
and none is perfect."

14:56.920 --> 14:59.878
Well, Sherri's not like that.
You're gonna wanna take your time.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.799
- I can do that.
- But don't loiter either.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.276
You don't want her to get bored
and play solitaire on your head.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.111
No loitering. Got it.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.429
- Something else?
- Okay.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.797
When you're with a woman like Sherri,
who's so gosh-darn beautiful...

15:17.960 --> 15:20.428
...that you get excited
just thinking about her...

15:20.840 --> 15:25.436
...how do you keep the sprinklers from
going off while you're still mowing?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.195
Let me make sure I understand.

15:30.640 --> 15:35.236
You wanna keep your toothpaste
in the tube until you're done brushing.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.158
What are you talking about?

15:38.720 --> 15:42.793
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay. Let me try again.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.070
I don't wanna frost the cake
while I'm still mixing the batter.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.109
I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.550
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.951
All right. Here's what you do.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.995
When you feel like the train
is leaving the station...

16:04.200 --> 16:06.316
You mean, going in the tunnel?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.590
No, no, I mean leaving the station.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.553
But you have to leave the station
to get to the tunnel.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.790
Okay, okay.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.279
Let's start from the top.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.874
And work our way down, right?

16:22.120 --> 16:25.351
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.311
When you're making love,
the way to slow yourself down is...

16:29.480 --> 16:31.755
...to think of something
completely non-sexual.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.111
- Well, what do you think of?
- You.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.440
That was a really great dinner.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.238
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?

16:58.440 --> 17:00.351
I've been ready since I was 14.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.230
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.992
Okay.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.515
Hey, how about Diana Krall?

17:29.720 --> 17:33.429
Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD.
Do you mind bringing it back to him?

17:33.800 --> 17:34.789
Not at all.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.836
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.991
No problem.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.191
Hey, this is a cool, little CD player.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.597
Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your...
It was a gift.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.994
Perfect.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.112
Is there anything else
Charlie left behind?

17:54.440 --> 17:55.919
Just me.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.679
My brother's a fool.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.950
No argument here.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.632
- That is a very effective negligée.
- Thank you.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.791
- Was it a gift?
- No.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.077
- As a matter of fact, I bought it myself.
- Oh, good.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.230
- How long ago?
- What?

18:20.440 --> 18:22.635
Well, I was just wondering
if Charlie saw it.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.238
Alan, don't go there.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.638
Oh, I wasn't going anywhere.
It's just that...

18:29.800 --> 18:33.031
- Nothing. More kissing.
- Okay, okay.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.472
What exactly is bothering you?

18:37.080 --> 18:39.913
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.876
For example, once,
when Charlie and I were at camp...

18:44.040 --> 18:47.555
...I lost my swim trunks, and I had
to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and...

18:47.720 --> 18:50.154
...I just couldn't enjoy
the pool at all.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.072
So, what are you saying?
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?

18:55.280 --> 18:59.068
No, no. In this case,
I think you would be the pool.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.793
Maybe this was a bad idea.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.190
No, no, it's a great idea.
It's right up there...

19:04.360 --> 19:07.716
...with the wheel, fire and refrigerators
that give ice through the door.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.388
- Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
- What? Why?

19:10.600 --> 19:14.434
You can't be with me without it being
some competition with your brother.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.358
It's not a competition.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.115
And even it was, shouldn't we do it
first before you decide who wins?

19:20.840 --> 19:22.114
You are unbelievable.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.392
- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.313
Well, no ambiguity there.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.191
Don't forget your brother's CD.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.517
My eye!

19:39.760 --> 19:41.910
Man, I love sunsets.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.198
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.357
It's the pollution that makes
those pretty colors, you know.

19:54.560 --> 19:59.634
What you're enjoying is the effect
of light passing through airborne poison.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.312
No, that's not
what I'm really enjoying.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.038
Boy, I hope that's guacamole.
