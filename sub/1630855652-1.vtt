WEBVTT

01:48.500 --> 01:50.666
Entering sector G-38, Captain.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.125
A ship has entered this sector.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.125
They're early.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.666
It isn't <i>Home One.</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:00.333
Security alert.

02:01.875 --> 02:05.791
Comms, ask them to identify themselves

02:05.791 --> 02:07.791
and transmit their clearance code.

02:07.791 --> 02:08.875
Yes, sir.

02:13.791 --> 02:14.791
Ship approaching.

02:15.541 --> 02:19.875
Track distance mark eight-zero-four,
six-point-seven-two.

02:20.750 --> 02:21.916
What's the word, Comm?

02:22.458 --> 02:24.375
I'm receiving
their signal now, sir.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.750
They're Jedi.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.625
Say again?

02:31.625 --> 02:34.083
The signal.
It's an old Jedi clearance code.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.208
They say they're here to see the prisoner.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.000
Captain, who are they?

02:43.833 --> 02:45.125
I'm calling their bluff.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.125
Signal them to come aboard.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.875
I want to meet these "Jedi."

02:53.541 --> 02:54.916
Have security meet me in the hangar.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.625
- You've got the bridge.
- Yes, sir.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.250
Thank you for allowing us
to come on board, Captain...

03:51.250 --> 03:52.333
Hayle.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.041
If you don't mind me saying,

03:55.666 --> 03:59.833
it's quite a surprise
meeting Jedi out here.

04:01.291 --> 04:04.083
Our existence remains a mystery to most,
Captain Hayle.

04:07.416 --> 04:08.500
I bet it does.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.916
You put on a good show, but, uh...

04:13.250 --> 04:14.291
I don't buy it.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.125
I don't understand.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.583
You're no Jedi.

04:18.791 --> 04:23.458
Just some overconfident Imperial trash
who just pushed their luck too far.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.250
You're making a mistake.

04:26.833 --> 04:30.041
And you, sir, should have surrendered
when the Empire collapsed.

04:30.041 --> 04:35.375
Jakris, get RD-3 to scan
these imposters for identification.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.666
Allow me to show you our identification.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.291
You're right about one thing, Captain.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.250
We are no Jedi.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.791
<i>They're heading
to the detention level.</i>

05:01.791 --> 05:04.500
<i>The Captain's dead.
So are half the security detail.</i>

05:04.500 --> 05:05.958
How many targets are there?

05:05.958 --> 05:07.833
<i>Two, but they've split up.</i>

05:16.333 --> 05:17.416
Go, go, go!

05:17.416 --> 05:18.500
Look out! Look out!

06:03.916 --> 06:06.125
Baylan, you are true to your word.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.458
And well paid for it, Lady Morgan.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.125
The Jedi who captured me seeks the map.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.916
She knows about Thrawn.

06:21.583 --> 06:22.625
Who is this Jedi?

06:25.166 --> 06:26.916
Ahsoka Tano.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.291
Huyang...

11:48.083 --> 11:49.083
I found it.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.708
<i>I'm not... ...jammed.</i>

11:54.666 --> 11:55.666
Huyang?

12:24.583 --> 12:25.750
Come no closer.

12:27.291 --> 12:30.583
The map. Give it to us.

12:31.958 --> 12:32.958
"Us"?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.291
Us.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.833
Us.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.125
Initiate self-destruct protocol.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.875
Huyang, where are you?

13:59.791 --> 14:01.541
<i>I am above your position...</i>

14:02.708 --> 14:03.708
<i>Now.</i>

14:05.750 --> 14:07.083
<i>I shall set down.</i>

14:07.083 --> 14:09.291
No, you won't. Keep going.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.500
<i>I don't understand.</i>

14:16.041 --> 14:17.583
<i>What would you rather I did?</i>

14:17.583 --> 14:19.583
Just keep flying and lower the ramp!

14:38.291 --> 14:39.916
Good thing I arrived when I did.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.083
About that.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
Where were you?

14:44.958 --> 14:47.125
I was keeping the ship at a safe distance.

14:47.125 --> 14:50.708
If you didn't keep
at such a safe distance,

14:50.708 --> 14:52.916
maybe we wouldn't have lost communication.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.750
I am just following
standard Jedi mission protocol.

14:57.416 --> 14:59.666
Huyang, the Order doesn't exist anymore.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.458
Nonetheless, I have my programming.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.375
Next time, stay close.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.500
Watch my back.

15:08.583 --> 15:12.750
That is the job of a Jedi Padawan learner.
Which I am not.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.708
Anyway...

15:19.250 --> 15:20.250
I found it.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.125
The map?

15:22.708 --> 15:25.041
Right where Morgan said it would be.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.041
How did you get her to tell the truth?

15:29.041 --> 15:32.416
Let's just say
I didn't follow standard Jedi protocol.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.666
Hmm.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.541
<i>Fulcrum,
this is</i> Home One, <i>do you copy, over?</i>

15:39.541 --> 15:41.916
Come in, <i>Home One,</i> this is Fulcrum<i>,</i> over.

15:42.541 --> 15:45.375
<i>Copy,
incoming transmission, Priority One,</i>

15:46.041 --> 15:47.291
<i>there's been an incident.</i>

16:10.416 --> 16:11.458
Come in, <i>Home One,</i>

16:11.458 --> 16:15.583
this is <i>T-6</i> One-Nine-Seven-Four
on approach, over.

16:16.125 --> 16:18.541
<i>Copy that,</i> T-6,
<i>you are cleared for approach,</i>

16:18.541 --> 16:19.958
<i>hanger two-nine, over.</i>

16:19.958 --> 16:22.791
Affirmative. <i>T-6</i> out.

16:36.750 --> 16:40.000
<i>We're tracking you,</i> T-6,
<i>you are cleared for landing.</i>

17:15.583 --> 17:16.625
General Syndulla...

17:17.833 --> 17:18.916
it's good to see you.

17:18.916 --> 17:22.916
And you. Though I wish it were
under more pleasant circumstances.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.166
I'm afraid we've lost your prisoner.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.625
I've prepared a briefing
to get you caught up.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.375
Just like old times.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.500
Unfortunately.

17:39.041 --> 17:43.000
They took out an entire security detail
and scuttled one of our new starships.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.250
Who are they?

17:49.333 --> 17:50.333
I don't know.

17:51.416 --> 17:53.291
They seem to have abilities like you.

17:56.416 --> 17:58.875
These days, there are few
who can wield the Force.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.833
Perhaps one of them was once a Jedi.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.750
Possibly.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.875
Huyang, make a copy of this recording
and run a match on their lightsabers.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.708
What's their connection to Morgan Elsbeth?

18:16.500 --> 18:19.041
I have known her
to hire mercenaries in the past.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.500
Well, the investment paid off.
They vanished without a trace.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.291
The day isn't a total loss.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.166
A star map?

18:31.166 --> 18:32.625
Not just any star map.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.375
This one holds the secret Morgan's after.

18:36.708 --> 18:37.708
Which is?

18:38.291 --> 18:41.458
The location of the last missing
Imperial Grand Admiral.

18:44.708 --> 18:45.708
Thrawn.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.125
That's not possible.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.333
Thrawn died at the Battle of Lothal.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.208
His death was never confirmed.

18:57.833 --> 19:01.000
I started hearing whispers of his return
which led me to Morgan.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.916
She was a great ally of Thrawn's
during Imperial rule.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.583
She knows something.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.291
And the secret is held in that map.

19:17.833 --> 19:20.250
If Thrawn survived, does that mean Ezra...

19:25.833 --> 19:27.083
I hope so.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.041
Nothing is certain
except our enemy's belief

19:33.041 --> 19:34.583
that they know where to look.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.250
Okay.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.375
Let's take a look at this map.

19:45.958 --> 19:47.708
We cannot show you the map.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.541
The device is locked

19:51.166 --> 19:54.125
and the key to activating it
has eluded me.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.208
It's never a straight line
with you Jedi, is it?

20:00.291 --> 20:04.583
General, the Defense Council
is requesting an update on the incident.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.666
Tell them I'll be right there.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.958
You know who could help you with this?

20:16.375 --> 20:17.375
I do.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.125
Well?

20:22.041 --> 20:23.750
I'm not sure she'll want to help.

20:27.583 --> 20:28.750
She'll do it.

20:32.791 --> 20:33.791
For Ezra.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.583
<i>On this day
several years ago, the Empire was defeated</i>

20:51.708 --> 20:54.791
thanks to the heroic efforts
of Commander Ezra Bridger,

20:54.791 --> 20:58.125
who sacrificed himself
to liberate our world.

21:00.375 --> 21:04.000
This monument we dedicate here today

21:04.000 --> 21:08.541
stands in recognition of Commander Bridger
and the rebel leaders

21:09.291 --> 21:11.291
who fought so valiantly on our behalf.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.583
May their courage and commitment
never be forgotten.

21:17.916 --> 21:21.708
Here to say a few words
is one of those rebel leaders.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.000
Commander Sabine Wren.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.333
Sabine Wren.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.041
Uh...

21:36.041 --> 21:37.208
Huh?

21:45.666 --> 21:47.708
- Where is she?
- I don't know. She was just here.

21:47.708 --> 21:49.541
- Where did she go?
- I don't know where she went.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.916
- Get out there and say something.
- What?

21:51.916 --> 21:53.125
Cover for me.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.875
While we wait
for Commander Wren's arrival,

21:56.875 --> 22:00.250
allow me to introduce Senator Jai Kell,

22:00.250 --> 22:02.916
who will share with us some words of...

22:03.916 --> 22:05.375
wisdom.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.166
- Senator.
- Yep.

22:08.375 --> 22:10.791
Thank you, Governor Azadi,
for that introduction.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.666
I would like to thank you
for your support...

22:14.666 --> 22:18.250
Security,
I want a full perimeter sweep.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.375
Sabine Wren.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.375
Find her. Now.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.541
<i>This is Spectre Two-One,</i>

23:07.541 --> 23:09.916
<i>this is Spectre Two-One.
Commander Wren, do you copy?</i>

23:11.875 --> 23:13.708
<i>Repeat, Commander Wren, do you copy?</i>

23:17.333 --> 23:18.958
What do you want, Porter?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.625
Governor Azadi is looking for you.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.291
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

23:24.291 --> 23:26.166
Well, you're missing the ceremony.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.500
Oh, that was today?

23:28.500 --> 23:31.833
I thought you'd wanna be there.
It's a big day for you, hero.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.250
Yep. Well, you thought wrong.

23:35.416 --> 23:38.041
Look, Commander, I have my orders.
I'm gonna need you to pull over.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.625
Well, here's a new order.

23:41.791 --> 23:42.791
Get lost.

23:44.458 --> 23:45.458
Can't do that.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.458
<i>Stand down, Commander.</i>

24:13.458 --> 24:14.541
What's she doing?

24:21.750 --> 24:23.291
Commander, stand down.

24:24.791 --> 24:25.791
<i>Sabine?</i>

24:27.041 --> 24:28.250
Is she gonna stop?

24:31.083 --> 24:32.541
Sabine, stand down.

24:32.541 --> 24:34.041
She's not stopping.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.333
Sabine!

24:40.958 --> 24:42.208
She's crazy.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.916
Hey.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.500
Hi.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.458
<i>Hey, Sabine.</i>

26:41.666 --> 26:43.375
<i>I'm sorry for disappearing on you.</i>

26:44.958 --> 26:49.125
<i>I made this recording because,
more than the others,</i>

26:49.125 --> 26:50.791
<i>I need you to understand.</i>

26:51.875 --> 26:55.875
<i>As a Jedi, sometimes you have to make
the decision no one else can.</i>

26:57.166 --> 26:59.375
<i>So that's what I did to defeat Thrawn.</i>

27:01.041 --> 27:04.416
<i>We've been through a lot.
Grew up together in this Rebellion.</i>

27:05.750 --> 27:10.208
<i>And we're not really family,
but you're like a sister to me.</i>

27:11.875 --> 27:15.416
<i>I know your fight isn't over,
and now I won't be there to help you.</i>

27:16.916 --> 27:19.083
<i>But I'm counting on you
to see this through.</i>

27:20.291 --> 27:21.666
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

28:01.208 --> 28:02.333
What was this place?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.916
An ancient temple built by my ancestors.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.125
The Nightsisters of Dathomir.

28:17.458 --> 28:18.458
You're a witch?

28:23.833 --> 28:24.833
A survivor.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.291
There's not much left back there.

28:34.208 --> 28:38.083
Either the Jedi has the map
or it was vaporized.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.750
She has it.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.166
Well, if she does, you're lucky.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.583
Luck has nothing to do with it.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.541
Fate has decided our next move.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.833
Send this one to the planet Lothal.

29:21.958 --> 29:22.958
Master?

29:23.875 --> 29:24.875
Do as she says.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.500
Why Lothal?

29:30.041 --> 29:31.625
What thread is she spinning?

29:31.625 --> 29:33.208
No, it's not witchcraft.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.791
Ahsoka Tano's former apprentice
is on Lothal.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.416
You're looking for Sabine Wren.

30:09.583 --> 30:10.833
<i>It's up to all of you now.</i>

30:13.833 --> 30:14.833
<i>And remember...</i>

30:16.750 --> 30:19.083
<i>the Force will be with you. Always.</i>

30:21.666 --> 30:22.708
Ezra.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.083
But, um...

31:12.375 --> 31:13.958
You missed the ceremony.

31:15.708 --> 31:16.750
Was that yesterday?

31:18.583 --> 31:19.750
It slipped my mind.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.625
You were missed, Sabine.
Everyone was there.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.708
Not everyone.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.541
Greetings, Sabine Wren.

31:28.750 --> 31:31.833
Hello, Huyang. Still in one piece?

31:31.833 --> 31:35.625
Oh, yes, and still 75% original parts.

31:40.125 --> 31:43.916
Well then. I'll be on the ship.

31:56.083 --> 31:58.291
You're gonna wanna hear
what she has to say.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.208
I think I know how to find Ezra.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.666
You really think Ezra's still out there?

33:36.416 --> 33:37.500
Nothing is certain.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.708
However, our enemy
is actively seeking Thrawn.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.833
Which is what led me to the map.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.416
Where did you find this?

33:51.833 --> 33:53.083
On a world named Arcana.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.333
It was a stronghold
for the Witches of Dathomir...

33:58.416 --> 33:59.833
...thousands of years ago.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.291
Witches.

34:02.916 --> 34:03.958
Great.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.000
This is getting more exciting
by the minute.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.916
I take it these patterns have meanings?

34:12.875 --> 34:15.583
You have the artist's eye.
Tell me what you see.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.833
Well, no one would design a map
you couldn't read.

34:25.833 --> 34:29.750
There must be a key or codex of some sort.

34:31.791 --> 34:32.958
Perhaps this will help.

34:36.666 --> 34:39.708
This is a scan Huyang took
of the temple where we found it.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.166
So, where do you call home these days?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.291
This ship serves me fine.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.375
Still?

35:04.875 --> 35:07.875
Don't you ever get tired
of moving from one place to another?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.500
I go where I'm needed.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.166
Not always.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.291
You never make things easy.

35:21.791 --> 35:22.791
Why should I?

35:24.291 --> 35:27.625
You never made things
easy for me, "Master."

35:32.708 --> 35:35.041
There is nothing easy about being a Jedi.

35:36.416 --> 35:39.000
Well, then I should've made a good one.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.083
Yes.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.041
You should have.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.625
Lady Tano, I have an update.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.916
Not right now, Huyang.

35:54.583 --> 35:55.666
Go ahead.

36:00.875 --> 36:02.125
I'm gonna need that scan.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.625
Can I take this?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.041
Where are you going?

36:09.708 --> 36:11.458
Somewhere I can think more clearly.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.208
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.416
Why?

36:25.125 --> 36:27.708
This isn't just about finding Ezra.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.375
It's about preventing another war.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.333
You think I don't know that?

36:41.125 --> 36:42.125
The map stays here.

36:47.458 --> 36:48.708
Okay.

37:07.083 --> 37:10.333
I see the two of you
are getting reacquainted.

37:10.333 --> 37:11.791
So what did you find?

37:11.791 --> 37:15.541
As you requested, I have run
an analysis on the lightsabers.

37:16.333 --> 37:20.041
The image was corrupted,
but using my extensive database

37:20.041 --> 37:24.208
I was able to reconstruct the details
of the two hilts.

37:25.083 --> 37:29.458
They are quite elegant,
with several classic design motifs.

37:30.291 --> 37:34.000
It's all very fascinating, Huyang,
but do you have any names?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.250
Patience. This is where
it gets interesting.

37:38.375 --> 37:42.791
The construction and overall design
are executed exactly the way

37:42.791 --> 37:46.625
I taught younglings to build a lightsaber
at the Temple.

37:47.291 --> 37:48.708
So, definitely Jedi-trained?

37:49.541 --> 37:54.291
Yes. However, this one I do not recognize.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.333
But this one...

37:57.583 --> 38:01.958
In the last 500 years,
I've only known one student

38:01.958 --> 38:04.000
who built a saber such as this.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.500
Baylan Skoll.

38:07.791 --> 38:11.958
He disappeared at the end
of the Clone Wars. Like so many Jedi.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.208
A master and an apprentice?

38:20.916 --> 38:22.333
That would be my assumption.

38:24.250 --> 38:29.333
If both trained in the Jedi Arts,
they will be formidable adversaries.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
For you alone.

38:33.708 --> 38:37.333
Of course, you may not be alone
for much longer.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.125
Maybe.

38:44.333 --> 38:45.333
Thank you, Huyang.

38:50.916 --> 38:52.666
Sabine, you're going to want to hear...

40:13.291 --> 40:14.375
Uh-uh.

40:15.583 --> 40:17.375
Looking for a key, okay?

41:19.500 --> 41:21.833
I'm not sure coming here
was such a good idea.

41:22.708 --> 41:24.416
<i>Sounds like it didn't go so badly.</i>

41:25.041 --> 41:29.791
She took the map off the ship
when I explicitly told her not to.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.291
<i>Well, maybe she just needed
some space to think.</i>

41:33.125 --> 41:35.375
More clearly, according to Lady Wren.

41:36.125 --> 41:38.250
<i>See? There you go.</i>

41:39.166 --> 41:40.333
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

41:40.333 --> 41:42.833
I don't understand why things
have to be so difficult.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.333
<i>Well, considering your history,
I'd say that's expected.</i>

41:47.125 --> 41:50.750
<i>But you and I both know Sabine gives you
the best chance of reading that map.</i>

41:54.625 --> 41:55.625
You're right.

41:57.583 --> 42:01.083
I just wish she had changed a little.

42:02.791 --> 42:05.875
But she's still
just as stubborn and bullish as ever.

42:06.541 --> 42:07.625
<i>She's Mandalorian.</i>

42:09.166 --> 42:11.166
<i>You knew what you were getting into.</i>

42:13.416 --> 42:14.416
I thought I did.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.583
Things didn't turn out
the way either of us wanted.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.333
<i>Mentoring someone is a challenge.</i>

42:24.083 --> 42:26.500
<i>I bet your Master
found you difficult at times.</i>

42:36.583 --> 42:38.666
Anakin never got to finish my training.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.583
Before the end of the Clone Wars,
I walked away from him.

42:46.166 --> 42:47.458
And the Jedi.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.375
Just like I walked away from Sabine.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.416
<i>I'm sure you had your reasons.</i>

43:02.875 --> 43:06.333
Sometimes even the right reasons
have the wrong consequences.

43:09.125 --> 43:10.166
What do we do then?

43:24.375 --> 43:25.666
Well, you're of no help.

43:54.416 --> 43:55.750
Three figures...

44:11.958 --> 44:13.250
Three faces...

45:20.833 --> 45:21.833
The key.

46:11.416 --> 46:12.416
This is it.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.125
I think I'm going on a trip.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.666
Huyang! I need backup now!

47:29.541 --> 47:30.666
We have a problem.

47:51.916 --> 47:53.333
We've been looking for this.

47:55.708 --> 47:56.708
That's too bad.

49:01.833 --> 49:04.041
She's at the old communications tower.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
There.

50:06.583 --> 50:08.125
- I see them.
- Bring us in.
