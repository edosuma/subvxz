00:05.772 --> 00:08.837
Welcome to the San Diego
Emergency Shelter.

00:09.907 --> 00:12.074
Right. Put them over there.

00:12.076 --> 00:13.342
Keep them coming, boys!

00:13.344 --> 00:14.677
We're up and running,

00:14.679 --> 00:16.245
getting new customers by the truckload.

00:16.247 --> 00:19.381
All right, let's get these boxes moving.

00:19.383 --> 00:20.649
What happened?

00:20.651 --> 00:22.618
They came in the middle of the night

00:22.620 --> 00:24.253
and took everything we had.

00:24.255 --> 00:26.021
Ration cards, food, clothes...

00:26.023 --> 00:27.890
our house.

00:27.892 --> 00:30.092
Told us we had four hours to move.

00:30.094 --> 00:31.560
Said we worked for them now.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.229
- Who did?
- Marines.

00:33.231 --> 00:35.631
They swapped out their patches
for California United Forces.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.800
I grew up on a base.
I knew who they were.

00:37.802 --> 00:39.468
I hear you, but you need to know,

00:39.470 --> 00:40.703
those Marines didn't know
what they were doing.

00:40.705 --> 00:41.904
They were fooled just like us.

00:41.906 --> 00:43.706
They took everything.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.040
Don't give up hope. You hear me?

00:45.042 --> 00:46.575
We'll get through this.

00:46.577 --> 00:49.678
- We will.
- Thanks.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.852
No, it's your chair. I understand.

00:56.854 --> 00:59.488
It'll be okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.

01:00.203 --> 01:01.548
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics,

01:01.550 --> 01:02.949
but you got to stay off your feet.

01:02.951 --> 01:06.419
- They're badly infected.
- Okay. Thanks, doc.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.840
Your attention, please.

01:09.842 --> 01:11.588
If you need immediate
medical assistance,

01:11.750 --> 01:13.710
please raise your hand
and I'll come to you.

01:13.712 --> 01:15.112
- Sorry.
- Can't help.

01:15.114 --> 01:16.813
- Good luck.
- Here. Let me...

01:16.815 --> 01:19.483
No more! Leave us alone!

01:19.485 --> 01:21.018
You guys have done enough.

01:51.216 --> 01:53.917
Mr. Castillo was very
forthcoming with details

01:53.919 --> 01:55.165
on the other regional leaders...

01:55.166 --> 01:57.921
Their homes, habits, security detail.

01:57.923 --> 01:59.990
We tasked a satellite
to do some early recon.

01:59.992 --> 02:01.258
It's all in your packets.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.960
Randall Croft, New York City.

02:02.962 --> 02:04.995
Lives in a penthouse, 60
floors above Park Avenue.

02:04.997 --> 02:06.897
Gonna be tough to sneak up on him.

02:06.899 --> 02:08.497
He does like to drink.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.800
That much I know to be true.

02:09.993 --> 02:12.736
Most nights, you can find him stumbling
out of a pub on the West Side,

02:12.738 --> 02:14.104
couple of hours before sunrise.

02:14.106 --> 02:16.306
And Wilson is out on
a farm somewhere, right?

02:16.308 --> 02:18.375
Yes, sir.50 miles south of Des Moines.

02:18.377 --> 02:21.011
Sleeps with the windows open.
Likes the fresh air.

02:21.013 --> 02:23.013
He's got dogs, but we can handle them.

02:23.015 --> 02:24.815
Price is the smartest and the meanest.

02:24.817 --> 02:25.816
Her place is a fortress.

02:25.818 --> 02:26.950
You leave her up to me,

02:26.952 --> 02:28.518
if it's all the same to you.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.089
So, small teams, set targets,

02:32.091 --> 02:35.525
simultaneous assault to cut
off the heads of leadership.

02:35.527 --> 02:37.594
All goes right, we can expect
limited casualties.

02:37.596 --> 02:40.430
So in one fell swoop, we take
out all three leaders?

02:40.432 --> 02:44.067
Four. We need to
take out the mastermind.

02:44.069 --> 02:46.403
We need to take out Shaw.

02:49.074 --> 02:51.208
I know you're all concerned,
but just sit tight.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.976
I'm sure Castillo has an explanation

02:52.978 --> 02:54.511
as to why the train hasn't arrived.

02:54.513 --> 02:57.047
Or why he isn't answering
any of our calls!

02:57.049 --> 02:58.682
Something's going on, Allison.

02:58.684 --> 03:01.885
Yeah, he's stealing Beatty's
livestock is what's going on.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.321
Our livestock, for Christ sakes.

03:04.323 --> 03:08.659
My sources are telling me this
was not Castillo's doing.

03:08.661 --> 03:10.927
That train was attacked.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.698
And how it was taken out,
it was no small rebel hit.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.133
Yeah, well, if that's the case

03:16.135 --> 03:17.734
and a revolution starts out west,

03:17.736 --> 03:20.337
then we're gonna have a real
shit sandwich on our plates.

03:20.339 --> 03:23.140
And if Castillo falls,
who takes over his region?

03:23.142 --> 03:25.275
Stop, all of you. I will handle this.

03:25.277 --> 03:26.611
Like you've handled it before?

03:26.738 --> 03:28.878
Once my people come back
with answers about the train,

03:29.036 --> 03:32.329
we will decide the best
way to proceed... together.

03:33.595 --> 03:36.386
Get them started. ‭All
right, I'll let them know.

03:36.388 --> 03:37.621
Have you found them yet?

03:37.623 --> 03:39.847
We think they're somewhere off
the coast of San Diego, but we...

03:39.849 --> 03:42.025
I'm not talking about
Nathan James, Powell.

03:42.027 --> 03:46.363
No. We haven't found them yet.

03:46.365 --> 03:49.199
Keep looking.

03:54.073 --> 03:55.405
Last time she checked in,

03:55.407 --> 03:57.307
they were splitting
from Chandler's family.

03:57.309 --> 03:58.975
I'm sure Mom found a good place

03:58.977 --> 04:00.744
for them to lie low with the baby.

04:00.746 --> 04:02.546
Kara, you should take Wilson.

04:02.548 --> 04:05.782
Let me handle Shaw. You
can't let it be personal.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.150
Look, this is a mission.

04:07.152 --> 04:09.453
If you let your
judgment get clouded by anger or...

04:09.455 --> 04:11.388
Hey, this is personal for all of us.

04:11.390 --> 04:13.090
But that's not why I'm going.

04:13.092 --> 04:14.524
No one knows Shaw like I do.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.793
What if something happens to both of us?

04:16.795 --> 04:18.261
Then Frankie will know we died

04:18.262 --> 04:20.764
so he didn't have to
grow up in a world like this.

04:20.766 --> 04:23.166
It's not gonna happen.

04:23.168 --> 04:25.068
Grenades, chem lights,

04:25.070 --> 04:28.839
45 caliber with 30 rounds of ammunition.

04:30.609 --> 04:33.710
Dad... Mind your own business.

04:33.712 --> 04:35.547
Whoa.

04:35.687 --> 04:37.781
Don't forget your extra mags
are in your right pocket,

04:37.783 --> 04:38.949
not the left.

04:38.951 --> 04:40.884
Yes, ma'am.

04:40.886 --> 04:43.787
Any more advice
‭before we head downrange?

04:43.789 --> 04:45.021
Kick some ass.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.923
Roger that.

04:48.761 --> 04:51.595
North Island Air Station,
Nathan James...

04:51.597 --> 04:54.831
Expect an 0700 arrival
of our operations personnel.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.299
Roger, Nathan James.

04:56.301 --> 04:58.401
Transport planes are fueled
and standing by.

04:58.403 --> 05:00.771
Thank you. Nathan James out.

05:00.773 --> 05:04.107
Greyhound 1 Charlie
Tango clear for takeoff,

05:04.109 --> 05:06.843
runway 2-niner. Winds 2-7-0-1-0.

05:06.845 --> 05:08.345
Altimeter 2-niner-niner-2.

05:08.347 --> 05:11.848
Contact departure 125.15.
Have a good day.

05:23.562 --> 05:27.998
Seems like every time we put
the country back together,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.666
it falls apart again.

05:29.668 --> 05:31.902
We're still here, Captain.

05:31.904 --> 05:33.904
When it breaks, we'll fix it.

05:33.906 --> 05:37.307
It's a big country.

05:40.479 --> 05:42.954
Big country.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.972
_

05:57.001 --> 06:01.103
Sir, we have body-cam footage
from all four land teams.

06:01.105 --> 06:03.072
And my ISR?

06:03.074 --> 06:04.507
We've retasked the satellites

06:04.509 --> 06:06.876
to give you 2 square miles
around each target.

06:06.878 --> 06:08.377
ISR?

06:08.379 --> 06:11.080
Intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance.

06:11.082 --> 06:12.515
Gives us a bigger picture.

06:12.517 --> 06:14.183
So you're their guardian angels.

06:14.185 --> 06:15.818
Something like that.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.587
All teams, stand by for sat
link and position report.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.540
_

06:23.686 --> 06:26.844
_

06:27.821 --> 06:30.294
_

06:30.568 --> 06:32.568
- How long before you're ready?
- We're good to go.

06:32.570 --> 06:35.304
As soon as Vulture team gets
a visual on Croft, we move.

06:35.306 --> 06:36.605
If all goes as planned,

06:36.607 --> 06:39.108
this will be over within the hour, sir.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.776
Mm.

06:40.778 --> 06:43.712
Sat link confirmed in
all four regions, sir.

06:43.714 --> 06:46.515
Video transmissions
from each team are up.

06:48.252 --> 06:50.119
- We think it's beautiful.
- I think so, too.

06:50.121 --> 06:52.755
- What about you?
- I absolutely agree.

06:52.757 --> 06:55.658
Yeah. That's him.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.526
Nathan James, this is Vulture team.

06:57.528 --> 06:59.662
We have eyes on the
prize. Standing by at set point.

06:59.664 --> 07:00.996
Copy that, Vulture team.

07:00.998 --> 07:02.765
All teams, requesting go status.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.201
- This is Tiger, good to go.
- Vulture, good.

07:05.203 --> 07:06.669
Cobra team, good to go.

07:06.671 --> 07:09.638
This is Raptor team,
ready to kick some ass.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.877
All teams, stand by
to execute in 3... 2... 1.

07:14.879 --> 07:16.445
Execute.

07:24.956 --> 07:28.290
Tiger, I'm seeing no movement
on the northeast side.

07:28.292 --> 07:31.760
Dogs are still. You
are clear to proceed.

07:33.464 --> 07:36.999
Vulture, Croft's taking the north alley.

07:37.001 --> 07:39.001
Cobra, entrance is clear.

07:43.574 --> 07:46.308
Yeah, hookers would be
good at this point.

07:48.112 --> 07:51.146
Stay with the team here.

08:05.496 --> 08:08.030
Raptor, bogey coming at you hard.

08:08.032 --> 08:09.098
Copy that.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.833
Unh!

08:16.073 --> 08:19.275
Vulture team, Croft and
company 100 yards to your west,

08:19.277 --> 08:20.743
heading southbound.

08:20.745 --> 08:22.320
Veer left around the corner
of the building,

08:22.321 --> 08:24.880
then proceed north. You can cut him off.

08:29.053 --> 08:30.419
Oh, wait. Uh...

08:30.421 --> 08:32.421
Yaah!

08:32.423 --> 08:35.591
Smile for the camera, Croft.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.494
Tiger team's inside.

08:45.136 --> 08:46.902
Rise and shine, asshole.

08:50.308 --> 08:52.775
Jackpot. We got Wilson.

08:52.777 --> 08:56.245
Raptor moving in on the master suite.

09:08.392 --> 09:12.161
- Raptor, how we doing? Damn it.

09:12.163 --> 09:13.862
Price ain't here.

09:18.536 --> 09:21.837
Living room clear. Approaching bedroom.

09:25.076 --> 09:26.942
Clear.

09:26.944 --> 09:28.544
Negative on Shaw.

09:28.546 --> 09:30.980
Damn it! We only got two.

09:30.982 --> 09:32.247
We'll get the others.

09:32.249 --> 09:34.116
- Keep me updated.
- Yes, sir.

09:34.118 --> 09:35.384
Cobra, where is she?

09:35.386 --> 09:36.652
We're working on it.

09:36.654 --> 09:39.521
There's only one other place she'd be.

09:40.958 --> 09:43.058
We've got a problem.
Captain Chandler's alive.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.327
We think he's the one
that stopped that train.

09:45.329 --> 09:47.229
We saw the ship sink. He should be dead!

09:47.231 --> 09:48.998
He will be.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.500
Our intel says he's on the ship
with Castillo in custody.

09:51.502 --> 09:53.602
- So he's coming after us?
- Not if I can help it.

09:53.604 --> 09:54.777
That's why I called you here.

09:54.926 --> 09:56.338
Why me? Why not Croft or Wilson?

09:56.340 --> 09:57.740
You really want Croft or Wilson

09:57.742 --> 09:59.742
with their fingers
on the button, Roberta?

09:59.744 --> 10:04.146
Why, you sneaky
little so-and-so.

10:04.148 --> 10:06.782
You sold them out.

10:08.285 --> 10:09.885
We're ready.

10:11.322 --> 10:13.889
This time, I want a more
failsafe solution.

10:15.192 --> 10:17.593
What have we got? Nuclear weapons?

10:17.595 --> 10:20.295
Oh, Jesus, Roberta, we're
talking about California.

10:20.297 --> 10:21.497
I'm not that cynical.

10:21.499 --> 10:22.699
Well, you'll have to excuse me

10:22.736 --> 10:24.533
for not giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

10:24.535 --> 10:26.673
Nukes are too messy. We have
something more reliable.

10:26.674 --> 10:28.153
We're gonna find the Nathan James,

10:28.154 --> 10:31.306
we're gonna hit it, and we're
gonna watch Chandler die.

10:38.027 --> 10:41.325
_

10:44.021 --> 10:48.090
Wilson and Croft have been
secured in local prisons.

10:48.092 --> 10:49.356
And the others?

10:49.472 --> 10:50.926
Satellite feeds picked up

10:50.928 --> 10:52.694
Price's jet touching down in St. Louis.

10:52.696 --> 10:55.497
Our guess is she's headed to the
White House to meet with Shaw.

10:55.499 --> 10:58.167
I've diverted all teams
to that location.

10:58.169 --> 10:59.601
Once we have them in custody,

10:59.603 --> 11:02.004
we'll get you on the air
to address the people.

11:02.006 --> 11:03.906
And say what?

11:03.908 --> 11:05.841
We got Castillo's man to stand down,

11:05.843 --> 11:08.710
but what if the other generals
aren't so easily convinced?

11:08.712 --> 11:10.012
We could start a civil war.

11:10.014 --> 11:12.147
The rank and file will fall in line.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.083
They've just forgotten who they are.

11:14.085 --> 11:15.350
Who's gonna remind them?

11:15.352 --> 11:17.219
You put a suicidal mission in office,

11:17.221 --> 11:18.587
and I took advantage of it.

11:18.589 --> 11:21.223
We are public enemies
number one and two.

11:21.225 --> 11:22.691
The people don't trust us.

11:22.693 --> 11:25.160
That's because they've been poisoned.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.795
We'll change their minds.

11:26.797 --> 11:29.965
You know,

11:29.967 --> 11:32.668
before the quarantine was
in place in St. Louis,

11:32.670 --> 11:37.639
it was just me and 115
people in a Costco.

11:37.641 --> 11:39.608
But I was able to protect them,

11:39.610 --> 11:42.578
because they wanted more
than anything to be there.

11:42.580 --> 11:46.815
Not like those broken people
we saw in that shelter.

11:46.817 --> 11:49.585
Back then, ‭the people
wanted to fight.

11:49.587 --> 11:51.420
They still do, sir.

11:53.257 --> 11:57.626
I'm not so sure.

11:58.929 --> 12:02.030
Nathan James, Cobra
team... We're at the White House.

12:02.032 --> 12:03.599
Roger, Cobra.

12:03.601 --> 12:05.834
We're tasking satellite to your whiskey.

12:12.009 --> 12:16.178
We've got 10 guards out front,
who knows how many inside.

12:19.183 --> 12:23.552
Cobra in position at
the underground entrance.

12:24.421 --> 12:26.889
Multiple guards at elevator access.

12:26.891 --> 12:28.524
They've definitely beefed up security.

12:28.526 --> 12:30.859
All signs of a high-value asset.

12:30.861 --> 12:33.729
Shaw and Price have to be inside.

12:33.731 --> 12:35.564
Roger that, Cobra team. Hang tight.

12:35.566 --> 12:37.065
Backup's in transit.

12:38.269 --> 12:39.501
We've got a target.

12:39.503 --> 12:41.770
Let's get started.

12:45.109 --> 12:46.775
Vampire! Vampire! Vampire!

12:46.777 --> 12:48.510
Bulldog inbound, bearing 047!

12:48.512 --> 12:51.380
Air, kill track 86086 with birds!

12:51.382 --> 12:52.915
Track 86086.

12:55.452 --> 12:57.319
Evaluate as kill.

12:57.321 --> 12:59.354
Nothing on subsurface.

12:59.356 --> 13:01.690
SPY didn't pick it up until it
was practically on top of us.

13:01.692 --> 13:03.091
Radar is detecting no aircraft.

13:03.093 --> 13:04.693
Could the missile have been loitering?

13:04.695 --> 13:06.028
We would've spotted it sooner.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.130
I saw something on radar,
just for a second,

13:08.132 --> 13:09.998
but then it just... Disappeared.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.935
- Negative scan for subsurface.
- Pieces are breaking apart.

13:12.937 --> 13:16.605
Negative. We have no relay
yet on the signature.

13:16.607 --> 13:19.128
It was launched from a drone.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.857
Detecting two... no,
three new hostile tracks.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.515
UAV identified as an MQ-9 Reaper.

13:30.517 --> 13:31.603
Kill all inbound hostiles.

13:31.604 --> 13:33.496
Lieutenant
Granderson, locate ground control.

13:33.497 --> 13:35.000
I want to know who's
operating that drone.

13:35.004 --> 13:37.069
Yes, sir. Triangulating
the electronic signature.

13:37.071 --> 13:38.771
Track 86089. Evaluate as kill.

13:38.773 --> 13:40.606
Track 90. Evaluate as kill.

13:40.608 --> 13:43.542
Nathan James is putting up a
good fight, but not for long.

13:43.544 --> 13:46.545
Last known K.A.-signal
is originating from...

13:46.547 --> 13:48.313
St. Louis.

13:48.315 --> 13:50.416
Shaw.

13:50.894 --> 13:54.519
All teams be advised...
Nathan James is under attack.

13:54.688 --> 13:56.530
Command and Control
is in the White House.

13:56.532 --> 13:57.965
I say again, the drone attack

13:57.967 --> 14:00.201
is originating from the White House.

14:00.203 --> 14:01.469
Cobra needs backup ASAP!

14:01.471 --> 14:04.038
Tiger's 30 minutes out.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.708
This ain't a race we
can win! Raptor is 45 out!

14:07.710 --> 14:10.011
Vulture team's an hour and
a half from wheels down.

14:10.013 --> 14:12.246
Cobra team, hold position,

14:12.248 --> 14:14.916
but be ready to move as soon as
Tiger and Raptor teams land.

14:14.918 --> 14:18.052
Sir, we can't wait.
Cobra team should move in now.

14:18.054 --> 14:19.754
I'm not sending Cobra
team in without backup.

14:19.756 --> 14:21.188
They'll never make
it past the front gate.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.924
Lieutenant, locate the
satellite they're using.

14:22.926 --> 14:25.059
We can't take out the source,
we'll take out the comms.

14:25.061 --> 14:26.327
Yes, sir.

14:32.368 --> 14:33.734
We found them.

14:33.736 --> 14:36.704
What are y'all talking
about? Seems important.

14:36.706 --> 14:38.406
The next item on our agenda.

14:38.408 --> 14:39.774
- Which is?
- This.

14:41.678 --> 14:45.146
You could've warned me! My ear's
gonna be ringing all day.

14:45.148 --> 14:47.081
Get rid of her and take
care of her guards.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.916
We got to finish this job, Colonel.

14:50.111 --> 14:51.953
New incoming,
bearing 1-3-0 degrees!

14:51.955 --> 14:53.654
Lieutenant, where's my satellite?!

14:53.656 --> 14:54.822
I narrowed it down to two.

14:54.824 --> 14:56.724
Analyzing bandwidth usage now.

14:56.726 --> 14:57.992
It's too close for birds.

14:57.994 --> 14:59.060
Switching to 5-inch,

14:59.062 --> 15:01.395
uploading high-explosive
proximity rounds.

15:04.701 --> 15:06.634
Track 91 neutralized.

15:06.636 --> 15:08.703
- Nice shooting.
- Satellite confirmed.

15:08.705 --> 15:12.840
UAV is using ANIK F31...
NORAD I.D. 58763.

15:12.842 --> 15:14.809
TAO, sector SPY in that direction.

15:14.811 --> 15:16.844
Ready an eagle, fire on my command.

15:16.846 --> 15:18.412
We are killing that satellite.

15:18.414 --> 15:20.648
Target acquired.
Calculating fire control.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.017
I have missile lock on the satellite.

15:29.459 --> 15:32.393
Direct hit.

15:32.395 --> 15:35.563
- Damage report!
- Generator 2 down!

15:35.565 --> 15:37.231
Power diverted to essential
systems only.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.499
SPY radar's down.

15:38.501 --> 15:40.301
Missiles and 5-inch unresponsive.

15:40.303 --> 15:42.336
We've lost sat link and cameras.

15:42.338 --> 15:45.506
Engine room, what's your status?

15:45.508 --> 15:47.041
Chill water to SPY is down,

15:47.043 --> 15:48.876
and we need a few minutes
to get it up and running.

15:48.878 --> 15:50.945
Without fire control,
we're sitting ducks.

15:50.947 --> 15:53.481
Man navigational radars
and watch for bogies.

15:53.483 --> 15:55.116
X.O., in World War II,

15:55.118 --> 15:57.718
warships created
smokescreens by changing engine settings.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.387
Can we rig ours to do the same?

15:59.389 --> 16:02.590
Yeah, maybe, if we fill the service
tanks with low-grade fuel.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.658
But we can only
sustain it for a few minutes

16:04.660 --> 16:06.093
before damaging the engine.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.895
Do it.

16:07.897 --> 16:11.132
Align fuel valves from storage
tank three to service!

16:11.134 --> 16:13.167
Bypass the purifier!

16:13.169 --> 16:15.536
I need cans of unfiltered fuel now!

16:15.538 --> 16:18.739
- Yes, sir!
- O'Connor!

16:18.741 --> 16:20.474
Still working, ma'am!

16:20.476 --> 16:22.476
Work faster!

16:22.478 --> 16:25.246
Adding fuel! Give me 10 seconds!

16:25.248 --> 16:28.382
No, no, no. Go ahead.
Just cycle it again.

16:28.384 --> 16:30.284
CIC, engine room.

16:30.286 --> 16:32.853
Fuel systems aligned,
engines in battle override.

16:32.855 --> 16:33.721
Sealed!

16:33.723 --> 16:35.256
Throttle engines.

16:35.258 --> 16:38.626
Bridge, throttle engines
and circle back over the wake.

16:43.633 --> 16:44.765
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

16:44.767 --> 16:45.713
We lost visual.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.803
The Nathan James is using smoke
to mask their location.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.638
Well, then aim at the smoke.
You're bound to hit something.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.773
It ain't that easy. I'm working on it.

16:52.775 --> 16:56.677
Where's my fire control, radar?

16:56.679 --> 16:59.513
Sir, the pipes are badly damaged.

16:59.515 --> 17:01.015
We're gonna have to
cut the water supply.

17:01.017 --> 17:02.349
How long?

17:02.351 --> 17:05.986
An hour before we can
get SPY up and running.

17:17.032 --> 17:20.534
Cobra team, we are still under attack

17:20.536 --> 17:22.470
and have lost fire control.

17:22.472 --> 17:25.039
The only way to stop the UAV
is to take the White House.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.775
Can you breach without backup?

17:37.120 --> 17:40.421
We can do it. ‭We found
their weak spot.

17:40.423 --> 17:42.289
We'll radio when it's done.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.927
Roger. Out.

17:52.602 --> 17:56.103
Set EMCON. Condition alpha.

18:22.676 --> 18:26.745
The harpoons are radar
trackers, and the ship's gone to EMCON.

18:26.747 --> 18:28.580
Can you kill them or not, Colonel?

18:28.582 --> 18:30.248
Just hang on.

18:32.953 --> 18:35.921
Sir, we've got less than three minutes

18:35.923 --> 18:37.923
until the engines are shot.

18:37.925 --> 18:41.026
Once those doors open,
there's no turning back.

18:41.028 --> 18:44.196
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

18:52.639 --> 18:55.140
Shots fired! Shots fired!

18:55.142 --> 18:56.975
Multiple tangos! Shots fired!

18:56.977 --> 18:58.543
Aah!

18:58.545 --> 19:01.480
- Crash!
- East hallway!

19:06.120 --> 19:07.819
Multiple shooters!

19:15.095 --> 19:17.029
This way! Through here!

19:20.467 --> 19:21.400
Unh!

19:21.402 --> 19:22.834
Take care of that!

19:22.836 --> 19:24.336
Call in backup if you need to.

19:24.338 --> 19:26.805
Sir, the engines are overheating.

19:26.807 --> 19:28.840
We've got to shut them down.

19:28.842 --> 19:30.609
Chief, once we spot a bogey,

19:30.611 --> 19:33.211
you'll only have 5 seconds
to take it out.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.080
Yes, sir.

19:35.082 --> 19:36.748
We got what we need. We should go!

19:36.750 --> 19:37.949
Not yet!

19:37.951 --> 19:41.153
I got a target! ‭Then fire!

19:43.490 --> 19:45.957
Bogey inbound, bearing 096.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.893
Fire CIWS down that bearing!

19:52.433 --> 19:54.299
We got hostile!

19:59.740 --> 20:02.574
Aah!

20:02.576 --> 20:05.277
Hold down that exterior!

20:08.849 --> 20:11.016
Aah!

20:13.921 --> 20:15.821
I'm good!

20:15.823 --> 20:17.823
Aah!

20:24.531 --> 20:26.498
Aah!

20:27.334 --> 20:29.801
There are three down!

20:33.273 --> 20:34.573
Help me.

20:42.049 --> 20:44.583
It's on auto-fire.
They've already launched.

20:44.585 --> 20:48.019
- Inbound hostile, bearing 082!
- Second bogey, bearing 036!

20:48.021 --> 20:50.989
- Third hostile, bearing 042!
- Fire, fire, fire!

20:53.861 --> 20:56.595
- Distance 5 mikes and closing!
- Give me a read! Give me a read!

21:00.968 --> 21:03.068
CIWS mount 2-1 is out of ammo.

21:03.070 --> 21:05.403
That UAV's got at least
two missiles left.

21:05.405 --> 21:06.538
Come on, Sasha.

21:22.222 --> 21:24.856
Sir, it's gone quiet.

21:24.858 --> 21:26.391
Detecting no inbound threats.

21:26.393 --> 21:28.693
Picking up something on subsurface.

21:28.695 --> 21:30.295
An impact on the water.

21:30.297 --> 21:31.897
It's too big to be a missile.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.465
It's got to be the UAV.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.369
They're in here!

21:37.371 --> 21:39.971
Come on! Give me a hand!

21:39.973 --> 21:41.173
Breach the door!

21:41.175 --> 21:43.475
Last stand!

21:43.477 --> 21:46.178
Break EMCON.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.779
Try Cobra team.

21:47.781 --> 21:49.047
Yes, sir.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.917
There's got to be a dozen
guards out there.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.251
Hang tough.

22:19.846 --> 22:24.516
Nathan James, this is Cobra
team on Navy Red, over.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.091
Cobra team, Nathan James.

22:33.093 --> 22:34.693
You saved our ass.

22:34.695 --> 22:36.962
I'm not gonna lie...

22:36.964 --> 22:39.864
We sure are glad to hear your voice.

22:39.866 --> 22:43.001
Head on a swivel.

22:43.003 --> 22:45.503
The White House is secure.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.847
Where's Mrs. Price?

22:55.849 --> 22:57.749
Chandler's people killed her,
and they're probably not

22:57.751 --> 22:59.150
far behind us. ‭We need
to get out of here.

22:59.152 --> 23:00.318
And who are all these soldiers?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.387
- Now!
- You heard her! Let's go!

23:10.297 --> 23:12.831
- Eyes on!
- Formation.

23:12.833 --> 23:15.567
- Down!
- Hold your fire!

23:15.569 --> 23:18.169
My name's Captain Mike Slattery
of the United States Navy!

23:18.171 --> 23:20.272
Put down your weapons, soldiers!

23:20.274 --> 23:21.606
We don't report to you!

23:21.608 --> 23:23.875
I've been authorized to board that plane

23:23.877 --> 23:25.076
and arrest Allison Shaw

23:25.078 --> 23:26.945
by order of President Howard Oliver!

23:26.947 --> 23:29.814
Stand your ground, Corporal!

23:29.816 --> 23:32.284
President Oliver is a criminal!

23:32.286 --> 23:33.551
So is Captain Chandler!

23:33.553 --> 23:35.186
You'll never get out of here.

23:35.188 --> 23:36.688
And even if you do,

23:36.690 --> 23:40.358
got RPGs standing by to
take down that plane.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.727
Ms. Shaw is prepared to negotiate

23:42.729 --> 23:45.397
her terms of surrender!

23:51.171 --> 23:52.904
This is Captain Tom Chandler.

23:52.906 --> 23:55.573
- Daddy?
- Ashley?

23:55.575 --> 23:59.044
Daddy, they took us.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.646
- That's enough.
- Okay.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.348
You're gonna be all right, okay? Just...

24:03.350 --> 24:06.418
Now, Captain, let's just
get down to business.

24:06.420 --> 24:07.919
I'd like to leave St. Louis.

24:07.921 --> 24:09.220
You listen to me.

24:09.222 --> 24:12.490
You touch my son or my daughter,

24:12.492 --> 24:16.995
I will hunt you down
and I will kill you.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.463
You were gonna do that either way.

24:18.465 --> 24:20.231
That's why I'm willing to make a deal.

24:20.233 --> 24:24.169
A trade... Your children for you.

25:11.378 --> 25:14.081
We've done some early recon,

25:14.082 --> 25:15.625
come up with a few different options.

25:15.758 --> 25:16.648
- They still need work but...
- I don't want options.

25:16.650 --> 25:17.915
I want my kids back.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.240
That's part of every plan we've got.

25:19.243 --> 25:21.052
- We got to be smart about this.
- It's my family, Mike.

25:21.054 --> 25:22.754
I'm not taking any chances.

25:22.756 --> 25:25.523
- I'm going with you.
- Absolutely not.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.692
You go in there alone...

25:27.694 --> 25:30.728
you risk them killing all three of you.

25:41.508 --> 25:43.908
If anything happens to me...

25:43.910 --> 25:45.576
We'll take care of Sam and Ashley.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.378
You have my word.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.448
Just to get the kids.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.824
Let's go.

26:04.698 --> 26:05.897
If that plane takes off,

26:05.899 --> 26:07.932
we're never gonna see him again.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.000
We have options.

26:09.002 --> 26:11.836
Get the kids off, do what we got to do.

26:21.281 --> 26:22.914
Just you.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.050
She's here to take
my kids off that plane.

26:28.655 --> 26:31.823
He's here to make sure you don't
shoot me while that happens.

26:35.128 --> 26:36.427
Fine.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.359
You guys all right?

27:08.361 --> 27:10.495
We're okay, Daddy.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.636
Here I am.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.072
Now let them go.

27:30.913 --> 27:33.547
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

27:34.951 --> 27:37.885
It's all right. It's okay.

27:37.887 --> 27:39.320
I'm here now.

27:42.692 --> 27:45.192
Ashley...

27:45.194 --> 27:47.227
are you okay?

27:47.229 --> 27:49.530
It's not mine.

27:52.868 --> 27:55.169
They killed Grandpa.

28:06.716 --> 28:09.483
Kara's gonna take you.
You'll be all right.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.921
Come on, guys. Let's go. Okay.

28:14.991 --> 28:17.024
- Daddy, what about you?
- Ashley.

28:17.026 --> 28:19.560
Okay. We got to go. Come on.

28:27.737 --> 28:29.636
You too.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.208
Be safe, Commodore.

28:45.054 --> 28:46.520
All right, move the trucks!

28:46.522 --> 28:50.124
Move them! Move them!

29:23.325 --> 29:24.792
Where are we going?

29:24.794 --> 29:25.793
It's a big world.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.528
There are a lot of nice places.

29:29.265 --> 29:33.700
And when we get there, you kill me.

29:33.702 --> 29:35.836
That is the plan, yes.

29:58.394 --> 29:59.726
Now?

29:59.728 --> 30:01.762
Not yet.

30:06.669 --> 30:07.835
Corporal!

30:07.837 --> 30:11.071
The CNO of the United States
is on that plane.

30:11.073 --> 30:13.407
- Your CNO.
- Don't listen to him.

30:13.409 --> 30:16.176
As long as you wear those uniforms,

30:16.178 --> 30:19.146
you're sworn to protect the
Constitution from all enemies,

30:19.148 --> 30:20.647
foreign and domestic.

30:20.649 --> 30:22.850
The woman on that plane is the enemy.

30:22.852 --> 30:24.084
You know that!

30:24.086 --> 30:25.352
That's enough, Captain!

30:25.354 --> 30:27.121
You were all lied to.

30:27.123 --> 30:30.657
America didn't go away just
because four people said so.

30:30.659 --> 30:33.527
Don't listen to him! He's the enemy!

30:33.529 --> 30:36.730
It's not too late to
choose the right side!

30:37.867 --> 30:41.768
Surrender now. Lay down your arms.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.203
Join us.

30:43.205 --> 30:46.740
No one's joining
anyone! Keep those weapons up!

30:51.147 --> 30:52.746
Killing Michener.

30:52.748 --> 30:54.982
Was that always part of the plan?

30:54.984 --> 30:56.450
No, that was your fault.

30:56.452 --> 30:58.819
If you'd just stayed
on the plane in Hong Kong,

30:58.821 --> 30:59.820
he would've folded.

30:59.822 --> 31:02.623
He died because he believed in you.

31:02.625 --> 31:06.326
And because he didn't learn
the lessons of the plague.

31:06.328 --> 31:08.187
Which are?

31:08.330 --> 31:09.763
There are winners and there are losers.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.298
If you want to win, you have to fight.

31:11.300 --> 31:15.302
I suppose that's one
way of looking at it.

31:15.304 --> 31:17.905
It's the only way
to look at it, Captain.

31:17.907 --> 31:20.574
I come from a small town.
Everybody knew everyone.

31:20.576 --> 31:22.442
People left their doors unlocked.

31:22.444 --> 31:24.044
Until the virus came,

31:24.046 --> 31:27.181
and they tore each
other apart to stay alive.

31:27.183 --> 31:28.682
The man who ran the safe zone,

31:28.684 --> 31:31.351
he locked my sister and my
nephew and my mother out,

31:31.353 --> 31:34.788
not because they were sick...

31:34.790 --> 31:38.892
but because he wanted
more food for himself.

31:38.894 --> 31:40.561
And then the virus did come,

31:40.563 --> 31:43.397
and, one by one, I watched them die.

31:47.703 --> 31:52.773
He killed them, so I killed him.

31:52.775 --> 31:56.510
And since then, we've been
doing things my way.

31:56.512 --> 31:58.512
I make the choices.

32:04.386 --> 32:06.386
Now!

32:07.056 --> 32:09.256
Ugh!

32:10.726 --> 32:12.492
Shit.

32:12.494 --> 32:14.428
- Your six!
- Aah!

32:20.102 --> 32:21.835
You hear that?

32:25.674 --> 32:27.341
Either way, it's over.

32:27.343 --> 32:28.976
Get up.

32:35.517 --> 32:38.452
Don't do it, Commodore.

32:40.122 --> 32:42.055
I know what you're thinking.

32:45.327 --> 32:47.027
She's not worth it.

32:57.039 --> 32:59.773
It's not who you are.

33:03.512 --> 33:06.580
- Aw, shit.
- Tex.

33:06.582 --> 33:08.081
Tex!

33:11.086 --> 33:12.753
Tex.

33:19.595 --> 33:21.962
You're a good man.

33:38.814 --> 33:40.580
You're an American, Colonel.

33:40.582 --> 33:42.449
Stand down.

34:36.938 --> 34:39.572
Go ahead.

34:39.574 --> 34:42.409
Take me away. It won't matter.

34:42.411 --> 34:44.511
Somebody else will take my place,

34:44.513 --> 34:46.947
somebody who sees
the world for what it is

34:46.949 --> 34:48.815
and seizes the opportunity.

34:48.817 --> 34:51.051
The people are too wounded and scared

34:51.053 --> 34:52.284
to think for themselves.

34:52.286 --> 34:54.087
Today they follow you, but tomorrow,

34:54.089 --> 34:56.757
they will find another
golden calf to worship.

34:56.759 --> 34:58.625
That much I've learned.

34:58.627 --> 35:00.694
Are you so naive?

35:00.696 --> 35:03.930
Captain, ‭you didn't save the world.

35:03.932 --> 35:06.099
You unleashed the worst in human nature.

35:06.101 --> 35:07.768
You really want to save the people,

35:07.770 --> 35:09.136
you need to terrorize them.

35:09.138 --> 35:10.937
You need to take them
by the neck and shake them.

35:10.939 --> 35:13.473
You need to be more terrible
so that they don't have to be,

35:13.475 --> 35:15.342
and deep down inside,
you know it's true.

35:15.344 --> 35:17.010
The America you believe in is gone!

36:33.602 --> 36:36.837
I didn't have to kill her.

36:38.574 --> 36:41.341
She's responsible for
what happened in Asia.

36:41.343 --> 36:43.877
She took your kids, killed your father.

36:43.879 --> 36:47.514
I stood... on this ship...

36:47.516 --> 36:52.653
and lectured Rachel on the rule of law.

36:53.456 --> 36:55.856
You're just as human as the rest of us.

36:55.858 --> 36:58.759
I have to hold myself
to a higher standard.

37:01.997 --> 37:06.333
Shaw was right about one thing.

37:06.335 --> 37:11.071
This country has lost its moral compass.

37:12.975 --> 37:17.111
It needs someone to guide it.

37:17.113 --> 37:21.949
Get it back to its core values.

37:25.488 --> 37:28.255
I can't be that person.

37:28.257 --> 37:29.323
Tom...

37:45.508 --> 37:46.907
Danny?

37:46.909 --> 37:50.844
There's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

37:55.017 --> 37:58.619
He was a little restless
on the way over.

37:58.621 --> 38:02.222
I think he knew he was
meeting his daddy.

38:05.928 --> 38:07.861
You want to hold him?

38:07.863 --> 38:10.063
Yeah.

38:11.801 --> 38:13.367
Hey.

38:13.369 --> 38:15.435
Look at you.

38:15.437 --> 38:17.404
Hey, little man.

38:17.406 --> 38:20.374
Already flex his muscles.

38:20.376 --> 38:22.843
Oh, wow.

38:27.049 --> 38:28.515
It's so nice to finally meet you.

38:55.845 --> 38:59.046
Tom, you can't just walk away.

38:59.048 --> 39:01.615
We have too much left to do.

39:01.617 --> 39:04.852
It's Slattery's ship now.

39:04.854 --> 39:06.386
And he's got you.

39:06.388 --> 39:09.489
That crew out there needs you.

39:09.491 --> 39:12.125
Kathleen needs you.

39:12.127 --> 39:13.493
She's been crying all night.

39:13.495 --> 39:15.529
You haven't even gone to talk to her.

39:15.531 --> 39:17.397
What am I supposed to say?

39:17.399 --> 39:19.833
Which speech am I supposed
to give, Sasha?

39:19.835 --> 39:22.402
The one about the "casualties of war"?

39:22.404 --> 39:25.739
Or the one about a hero
dying for the cause,

39:25.741 --> 39:30.577
like the ones I gave for
Mason and Cossetti, Cruz,

39:30.579 --> 39:35.015
Chung... Frankie, Ravit...

39:37.753 --> 39:40.387
Rachel.

39:43.993 --> 39:48.729
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me.

39:48.731 --> 39:52.499
I wasn't there for Darien,
I wasn't there for my kids,

39:52.501 --> 39:54.268
for my father...

39:54.270 --> 39:56.670
Whatever you think is
broken, we can fix it.

39:58.540 --> 40:00.440
Put on your uniform.

40:55.431 --> 41:00.033
I speak to you today a humbled man.

41:00.035 --> 41:02.202
I've made mistakes.

41:02.204 --> 41:05.405
I was silent when I should
have spoken out.

41:05.407 --> 41:09.843
I ran when I should have
stood and fought.

41:11.313 --> 41:17.718
But in adversity, we find
strength and courage.

41:17.720 --> 41:21.855
The great Naval Captain Nimitz once said

41:21.857 --> 41:26.426
"God grant me the courage not to
give up what I think is right,

41:26.428 --> 41:30.998
even though I think it hopeless."

41:31.000 --> 41:33.700
Stand with me.

41:33.702 --> 41:36.036
Fight with me.

41:36.038 --> 41:40.007
Because together, we can move forward.

41:40.009 --> 41:46.480
Together, we can be strong again.

41:57.326 --> 42:00.994
Permission to go ashore
for the last time.

42:00.996 --> 42:04.097
Permission granted.

42:15.944 --> 42:17.377
Hip, hip!

42:17.379 --> 42:19.097
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip!

42:19.098 --> 42:20.140
Hooray!

42:20.141 --> 42:20.990
Hip, hip!

42:20.991 --> 42:22.026
Hooray!

42:22.850 --> 42:24.799
Don't look back!
