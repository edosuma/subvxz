00:10.719 --> 00:13.555
Welcome, players,
to the annual
Kikiwaka Cup!

00:13.930 --> 00:16.057
It's counselors
versus campers.

00:16.057 --> 00:17.767
Let's fight to the death!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.978
For the last time, Lydia,
no one is dying.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.980
(CHUCKLES)
That's what you think.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.190
Are you ready for this?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.234
I was ready
to win that cup.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.778
I was not ready
to see Ravi in shorts.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.032
He's been working
on his quads,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.200
and he wants
everyone to know.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.120
Okay.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.539
The object of the game

00:39.539 --> 00:42.375
is to grab
the opposing team's totem
from their home base.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.961
Can the two team captains
please step forward.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.963
As captain of the campers,

00:46.963 --> 00:49.090
I present to you our totem.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.509
And our home base
will be the flagpole.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.261
(WHOOPING AND CHEERING)

00:54.012 --> 00:56.056
And I present
the counselors' totem.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.932
And our home base
will be the North Meadow.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.518
COUNSELORS:
(CHANTING)
Wooh! Wooh! Wooh!

01:00.518 --> 01:03.897
Which is exactly where
you're gonna get
your tushies whipped.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.148
Good luck.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.733
The last time
the campers won,

01:06.733 --> 01:09.027
mullets were
still in fashion.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.571
That was one
ugly winners' picture.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.866
And we're gonna
cream you campers again,

01:14.866 --> 01:17.118
because this year,
we have Oscar.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.787
You got that right.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.540
I call this one Thor,
and this one The Rock.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.005
I miss one meeting,

01:29.005 --> 01:30.215
and this is who you hire?

01:31.716 --> 01:33.676
He thinks it's an internship,
so we got him for free.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.137
We're not afraid
of you wimps.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.056
This year,
we're finally
going to win.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.974
We've got
the dream team.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.893
Finn, who's fearless,

01:41.893 --> 01:43.812
Destiny, who's cutthroat,

01:44.103 --> 01:46.898
and Lydia, who's
generally terrifying.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.400
What about me?

01:49.651 --> 01:51.694
You're...
Also on the team.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.031
We'd win for sure,
if we had better leadership.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.575
I'm looking at you,
Zuri Loss.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.161
It's Zuri Ross.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.038
Mmm. Not according
to your track record.

02:02.997 --> 02:06.000
Lydia, I know
Woodchuck and Weasel
are rival cabins,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.711
but today we need
to work together
and be frie...

02:08.711 --> 02:09.921
(GAGS) Frie...

02:11.005 --> 02:12.799
I can't even say it
without gagging.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.718
Anyway, if a member
of the opposite team

02:15.718 --> 02:17.595
tags you while
you are on their turf,

02:17.595 --> 02:20.348
you are frozen
until someone from
your own team tags you.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.891
Remember, if you're
on your own turf,

02:21.891 --> 02:22.976
you can't be tagged.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.561
Take one step on my turf,

02:24.561 --> 02:26.855
and I'll tag you so hard,
your momma's gonna feel it.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.942
(NERVOUSLY) Boy...
I'm glad she's on our team.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.611
I got special jerseys made

02:33.611 --> 02:36.239
so everyone can look
totes cute as we
destroy each other.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.242
Let me in!

02:41.035 --> 02:42.412
Let me in!

02:47.292 --> 02:49.919
Hey, kid,
why are you
wearing a tent?

02:51.754 --> 02:53.923
The sad thing is,
this is a medium.

Okay, Oscar,
I'm gonna go
freeze some more campers,

03:15.987 --> 03:17.655
and you're gonna
guard the totem. Got it?

03:18.364 --> 03:20.992
Do you think
my calves
are too small?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.622
Your calves are fine.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.124
It's your brain
I'm worried about.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.255
Hey, Oscar.
What'cha doing?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
(CHUCKLES)
Guarding the totem,

03:36.257 --> 03:37.967
and doing calf raises.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.385
So, what's your
play here, kid?

03:40.136 --> 03:42.096
Uh, get the totem,
I think.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.264
I don't know.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.474
I didn't listen
to the rules.

(CHUCKLES)

03:45.767 --> 03:48.686
Oh! This is gonna be
like shooting fish
in a barrel.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.813
Fish? Barrel? Shooting?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.274

listen to the rules.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.401

03:59.239 --> 04:00.907
I guess you can hide.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.119
Oh, hi, little fella.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.166
Hey, can I borrow
your butt for a second?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.417
You can't win, Finn.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.378
I'm faster,
I'm stronger,
and I'm...

04:13.628 --> 04:15.755
Skunk! (SCREAMS)

04:17.382 --> 04:20.927
That was probably worse
for you than it was for him.

Ha! Froze you!

04:25.181 --> 04:27.100

04:28.101 --> 04:30.853
Counselors rock,
campers... Clock!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.107
Okay, that was terrible.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.194
Someone from my team
will be back any minute
to unfreeze me.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
Hopefully...

04:42.282 --> 04:43.324
FINN: Not the office!

04:43.324 --> 04:46.327
(PANTING AND EXHALING)

04:46.786 --> 04:48.204
I cannot believe

04:48.204 --> 04:50.248
you're throwing me
out of the game
for skunkin'.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.792
Back home,
that's how we start
every tractor pull.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.586
Does no one
in your town
own a whistle?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.132
Now, you must stay in here
until the game is over.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.175
But what if I get hungry?

05:01.175 --> 05:03.219
You should have
thought of that
before you broke rule

05:04.929 --> 05:07.056
"Using wildlife
as weaponry."

05:07.056 --> 05:08.391
But I will bring you
a sandwich later.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.144
Thanks, Ravi.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.687
I always knew
you were a big softie.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.147
Oh, am I?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.107
Because it will be
wheat bread.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.568
You're the worst!

05:18.568 --> 05:20.445
No one said
doing time was easy.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.821
But I will
cut off the crusts.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.079
Okay, so here's the plan.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.332
You run in and get
Zuri's attention,

05:32.332 --> 05:33.416
and get her
to chase you off,

05:33.416 --> 05:35.335
then I'll run in
and get the totem.
Got it?

05:36.252 --> 05:38.796
You think I could
bench press that kayak?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.424
You need to
focus on Zuri.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.218
I could definitely
bench press Zuri.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.263
Okay. Listen.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.183
We are in
Zuri's territory,

05:50.183 --> 05:52.894
which means
she can tag us,

05:52.894 --> 05:54.562
but we can't tag her,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.439
so be careful.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.191
Okay, okay, I got it.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.317
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

06:02.028 --> 06:03.237
(EXCLAIMS) Ha!

see me coming.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.671
Yes! That totem is mine!

06:20.671 --> 06:23.466
Ow! Ah!
I've hurt my ankle!

06:24.383 --> 06:27.136

Mama Chuck is here.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.221

You're frozen.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.765
I am not.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.558
Faking an injury
is against the rules.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.726
I wasn't faking.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.771
Then how come
you're not limping?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.732
It's a miracle!

06:41.317 --> 06:42.693
Oh, shoot!

06:47.865 --> 06:49.742
I gotta get out of here.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.788
Ow! Ow!
(LOUDLY) Ow!

06:54.163 --> 06:57.333
For the last time,
stop limping.
I know you are faking.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.211
Now you must stay in here
for the rest of the game.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.296
Ravi, I'm going crazy.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.965
I've been locked up
in here forever.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.342
You have only been
in here for five minutes.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.427
You gotta get me
out of here.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.638
I need to feel
the sunlight
on my face again.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.099
Anything to
keep you quiet.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.228
Oh, sweet golden light!

07:18.855 --> 07:20.857
Hey, I want my lawyer.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.109
And I want you
to stop talking,

07:23.109 --> 07:25.361
so neither of us
are going to get
what we want.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.864
(SQUEALS) Oh!

07:27.864 --> 07:30.450
Ravi, now I've really
hurt myself.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.493
I guess I have to
go to the infirmary.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.245
And not because
there's a TV in there.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.706
Nice try.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.249
Actually, that was
a terrible try.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.459
Your acting is dreadful.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.379
(EXCLAIMS) And now
I have an emotional injury.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.256
(SOBS DRAMATICALLY)
Stop it.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.176
(SIGHS)

07:58.394 --> 08:01.355
You have a better chance
of catching a cold
than catching me.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.857
Oh, both give me
a headache.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.361
How about we make this
a little more interesting?

08:07.361 --> 08:09.489
You mean a little side bet?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.032
Uh-huh.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.410
If the counselors win,
I get that scarf
you keep by your bed.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.954
(GASPS) Reba's scarf!

08:16.954 --> 08:20.082
The one she threw to me
after she finished
singing Fancy?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.375
Oh, that's the one.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.296
Fine.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.965
But if we win,
I get your lucky
pig's foot.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.342
(GASPS)

08:29.342 --> 08:32.094
That is my most
prized piece
of Penelope.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.388
Exactly.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.307
So, do we have a bet?

08:36.766 --> 08:37.975
Yep.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.399
And when you lose,

08:45.399 --> 08:48.361
you'll realize that foot
wasn't so lucky after all.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.529
For you or Penelope.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.370
Must dig a tunnel!
Must dig a tunnel!

08:58.496 --> 09:00.540
You're using
safety scissors.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.500
Yep, and by
my calculations,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.335
I'll be out of here
in 23 years.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.923
Argh! They broke.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.342
And it's not fair
that a counselor
is the ref.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.718
Yeah.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.011
Ravi just put us in here

09:14.011 --> 09:16.180
because we're the best
players on our team.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.266
...and stay in here!

09:21.227 --> 09:22.812
Well, there goes
that theory.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.277
There.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.361
Now you don't
have to worry

09:30.361 --> 09:31.946
about a strong wind
blowing you away.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.448
(CHUCKLES) Thanks, Destiny.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.743
And I still can't believe
you did something wrong.

What's next?

09:38.828 --> 09:40.454
Frogs falling
from the sky?

09:40.454 --> 09:42.582
Talking apes
taking over the Earth?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.166
Putting men on the moon.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.295
That already happened.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.504
Yeah, right.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.757
I'm sure what you did
wasn't even that bad.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.593
It was, too.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.262
In fact,
it doesn't get
much badder.

water balloon grenades,

and I'm gonna rain
on your parade.

I'm more afraid of.

His grenades
or his clever
word play.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.414
Boom! (LAUGHS CUNNINGLY)

10:23.414 --> 10:26.083
Looks like you're
all washed up.
(CHUCKLES)

10:26.459 --> 10:27.668
He did it again.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.295
Take me up, guys.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.841
(GRUNTING)

10:35.009 --> 10:36.594
That's silly.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.137
You don't even
own a tank top.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.015
Yeah, the first
week of camp,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.017
you swam
in a turtleneck.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.435
Okay.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.648
You want the real reason
I got thrown out?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.859
I threw a dodgeball
at Ravi.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.402
You did?

10:53.736 --> 10:56.030
You can pick up
a dodgeball?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.532
That's not the point
of the story.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.744
You know they don't
use dodgeballs
in this game, right?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.621
I was trying
to spice things up.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.622
So sue me.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.541
You may not realize this,

11:07.541 --> 11:10.378
but I happen
to be a bad boy.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.131
Name one other thing
you've ever done
that's bad.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.800
I...

11:16.342 --> 11:19.053
Once drank milk
after the expiration date.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.930
So not only
was I bad,

11:20.930 --> 11:22.556
but so was the milk.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.353
Hello!

11:28.437 --> 11:29.647
Anyone?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
(BUZZING)

11:32.108 --> 11:33.651
Oh, no! Bee!

11:34.360 --> 11:36.570
Get away,
I can't move my feet.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.948
Ugh, why do I
have to be such
a rule follower?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.827
If only you were
wearing a tiny
counselor's shirt,

11:42.827 --> 11:44.120
you could unfreeze me.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.163
Don't you sting me.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.873
No, no...

11:49.083 --> 11:50.751
(EMMA SCREAMS LOUDLY)

11:51.502 --> 11:52.795
Did you hear that?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.672
That's Emma's war cry.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.425
She is so inspirational.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.428
Okay, we need
to unfreeze some
of those counselors.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.554
We're running
out of players.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.722
I told them
not to carbo-load.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.558
It made them slow.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.227
Yeah, we know, Oscar.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.437
Pancakes are for the weak.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.566
I just know Lou is
plotting something.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.152
Hmm. Must be nice
to have a leader
with a plan.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.070
Oh, I have a plan.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.115
It involves
a very sad phone call
to your parents.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.118
Counselors!

12:24.118 --> 12:25.119
I'll tag Oscar.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.788
I'm gonna bury you alive!

12:27.788 --> 12:29.748
Why do I think you've
done that before?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
Ha! You're frozen!

12:33.669 --> 12:36.714
Looks like I'm
about to be
one pig's foot richer.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.134
Uh-oh.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.052
I should have
used the bathroom

12:42.052 --> 12:43.471
before we started
playing this game.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.558
One time, I ran
at the public pool.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.603
I also throw
regular trash
into the recycling bin.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.648
I could go on and on
about my delinquent behavior.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.609
You have.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.820
Yeah, I stopped
listening after,

12:59.820 --> 13:03.199
"Left the cap off
my history teacher's
dry erase marker."

13:04.325 --> 13:06.327
That's just how
bad boys roll.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.079
Sorry.
Not sorry,
am I right?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.874
In fact, I say
we break out of here

13:11.874 --> 13:13.209
and go get some ice cream.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.668
No!

13:14.668 --> 13:16.712
Then we'll just get
into even bigger trouble.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.756
And I can't do
any more time!

13:19.673 --> 13:21.634
It's already starting
to change me!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.386
That might not be
a bad thing.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.479
We just have to get
to the kitchen
and that ice cream is ours.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.774
I can smell
the mint chocolate chip
from here.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.484
Really!

13:38.817 --> 13:41.529
I smell pesticides
and sweaty counselors.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.781
Guys!

13:43.781 --> 13:45.741
How are we going to sneak
across the lawn
without anyone noticing?

13:48.744 --> 13:50.579
The coast is clear!
Let's go.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.083
RAVI: Hold it right there!

13:54.542 --> 13:55.543
FINN: It's Ravi!

13:57.586 --> 13:59.672
Scratch all you want, Spencer,
but if so much as one
tootsie leaves the ground

13:59.672 --> 14:01.423
you will be out
as out can be.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.679
He's gone,
move your raft!

14:10.516 --> 14:11.684
RAVI: Oh, Spencer!

14:13.394 --> 14:15.062
Here is some
calamine lotion
for that itch.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.689
I am a stickler,
but not a monster.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.650
Wait,
was that raft
not over...

14:20.401 --> 14:21.443
Oh, never mind!

14:31.871 --> 14:35.791
Okay, this is the year
when the kids
finally beat the grown-ups.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.878
Beat them is right.
I'll get my axe handle.
It's got nails in it.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.839
I meant win the game!

14:42.172 --> 14:44.091
Wow, your soul is as dark
as your eye makeup.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.636
Molly, you go right
and Kyle, you go left.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.972
We just need someone
to volunteer to get tagged.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.849
And that volunteer is Lydia.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.601
I didn't volunteer.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.019
Thank you for your service.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.478
Charge!

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
Ha!

14:59.732 --> 15:02.318
You two are more frozen
than that wart I had
last summer!

15:03.193 --> 15:04.528
I have said too much.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.531
Lou, how did you get unfrozen?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.491
Oscar came back
and unfroze me.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.702
And now I smell like skunk.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.914
Even though he works for free,
we're still overpaying him.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.167
Well, now that you're frozen,

15:18.167 --> 15:21.086
it's too bad you
don't have your Reba scarf
to keep you warm.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.089
You haven't won yet,
wart girl

15:24.924 --> 15:26.967
But if you do,
promise me you'll let me
visit the scarf

15:26.967 --> 15:28.886
and give it a sniff
every so often.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.059
Sneaking out and eating
ice cream with friends.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.685
It doesn't get any better!

15:38.312 --> 15:40.272
All I need for this
to be perfect is
some pageant trophies

15:40.606 --> 15:43.025
and the severed ponytails
of all my competitors.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.861
Sometimes...

15:45.861 --> 15:48.113
I don't know whether
to be friends with you
or call the cops.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.326
We should sneak back
into the office before
Ravi notices we're gone.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.245
(RAVI EXCLAIMING)

15:55.496 --> 15:56.830
What is going on?

15:57.498 --> 16:00.042
Certainly not
sneaking out
for ice cream!

16:04.380 --> 16:05.839
Do you think
he bought it?

16:05.839 --> 16:06.924
No!

16:07.549 --> 16:09.259
I cannot believe
you would defy me.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.345
Ravi, we're sorry.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.682
Finn, I presume
you are the ringleader
per uszh.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.476
No, Ravi,
don't blame Finn.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
It was my idea
to sneak out.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.855
What?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.649
This was your idea?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.401
Matteo,
what has gotten
into you?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.903
You snuck out of the office,
stole ice cream

16:27.903 --> 16:29.780
and you threw
a dodgeball at me.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.281
This is so unlike you.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.576
Well,
maybe you don't know me
as well as you think.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.330
Perhaps,
but I do know
that I'm disappointed.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.792
Ooh! He pulled
the disappointed card.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.627
He's good!

16:44.962 --> 16:45.838
The truth is...

16:47.589 --> 16:50.050
I threw that dodgeball
because I wanted to get
kicked out of the game.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.844
What?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.096
Why?

16:54.096 --> 16:56.974
Because it's less embarrassing
to get kicked out for being
a bad boy than it is to quit.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.892
But why would you
want to quit?

16:59.768 --> 17:00.978
Because...

17:01.979 --> 17:03.272
I'm too small to play.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.775
That's why you lied
about being a bad boy?

17:07.651 --> 17:08.777
Because you're too small?

17:09.486 --> 17:12.197
Matteo,
it doesn't matter
what size you are.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.116
You can still play!

17:14.491 --> 17:17.870
But every time
I try to play sports
I get pushed around.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.040
And the other kids tease me
because I'm not very good.

17:22.041 --> 17:22.958
I get it!

17:22.958 --> 17:24.418
It may surprise you,
but...

17:24.710 --> 17:25.794
I used to be short too.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.339
The good news is
being vertically challenged
has its advantages.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.259
For example,
you have much more
leg room on planes.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.094
I'm afraid of flying.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.429
Buses then.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.891
And, going through doorways,
you're less likely
to bump your head.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.060
And you're more likely
to be a witch.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.604
Oh, wait, that's witches.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.523
Okay!

17:47.941 --> 17:51.028
But one big advantage
is you would be much harder
to catch

17:51.028 --> 17:52.446
while trying to capture
the totem.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.908
So being short
can be a good thing?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.367
Absolutely!

17:57.701 --> 17:59.703
Now, I want you
to go out there
and show them.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.082
So, does this mean
you are letting me
back into the game?

18:03.707 --> 18:05.918
Yes.
Go win one
for the little guy!

18:09.129 --> 18:10.172
Can we go play too?

18:10.631 --> 18:13.050
Yeah.
We're really sorry
for cheating.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.470
Okay,
but please do not lie
about any injuries.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.472
And no more
throwing anything
that is alive.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.557
So a dead skunk
would be okay?

18:21.475 --> 18:24.061
You are the reason
the rule book
is so specific.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.486
Wait. Come back!

18:32.986 --> 18:34.071
Unfreeze us, Jenny!

18:34.404 --> 18:36.031
Ah, great.
She got tagged.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.991
You're dead
to me, Jenny!

18:39.034 --> 18:42.371
Man! You'd think a kid
from Cheetah cabin
would be faster.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.499
We're losing because
of you, wood jerk!

18:45.749 --> 18:48.001
This never would have happened
if I had been team captain.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.295
Please,
you're a lunatic.

18:52.005 --> 18:55.551
You probably would
have suggested we gnaw
all the counselors' arms off

18:55.551 --> 18:57.010
so they have
nothing to tag us with.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.971
That's ridiculous!

18:59.513 --> 19:01.098
You only have to
do it to one counselor.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.975
Once the others know
you're serious,
it's game over.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.103
(FINN WHISPERING)
Hey, guys!

19:06.103 --> 19:07.437
Good news,
we're back in the game!

19:07.771 --> 19:10.357
Great,
because most of our team
is frozen thanks to

19:10.357 --> 19:12.317
little Miss dark and creepy.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.611
It's a look!
(MOCKING) It's a look.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.199
You two done?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.035
For now.
I'll get her later.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.038
Look, we have a plan.

19:26.373 --> 19:30.043
That'll make sure
we kick those
counselors' butts and win.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.712
You had me at "kick."

19:33.130 --> 19:34.631
Great!
Let's hear it.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.884
I'm going to dodge
every counselor,

19:37.217 --> 19:39.136
grab that totem
and win the game.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.972
(CHUCKLING LOUDLY)

19:43.182 --> 19:44.683
No, seriously,
what's the plan?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.439
It's quiet!

19:51.106 --> 19:52.316
Too quiet.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.776
(CHUCKLING)
I can fix that.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.154
(LOUDLY) One! Two!

19:57.613 --> 19:59.489
Three!
That is not
what I meant.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.241
You threw
my count off.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.578
You were
only on three!

20:05.871 --> 20:07.623
Charge!
Real survivors!

20:07.623 --> 20:08.999
Campers!

20:08.999 --> 20:11.043
Over here!
Come get us!

20:11.043 --> 20:12.669
Ha! Got you!

20:13.086 --> 20:15.464
You two are more frozen
than a snotball in February.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.673
Ew!

20:17.132 --> 20:18.717
Looks like we're gonna win!

20:18.717 --> 20:21.553
My pig's foot is gonna look
even better wearing
your Reba scarf.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.263
That sounds great!

20:23.263 --> 20:25.265
Except you forgot
one tiny thing.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.850
Yeah.
What's that?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.435
Me!

20:30.646 --> 20:32.064
(GRUNTING)

20:35.651 --> 20:37.569
Let go!
We can't.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.030
We're frozen.
Your feet smell!

20:40.697 --> 20:41.990
That's the skunk!

and I'm...

to meet my friends.

the game for us!

I did! Now...

Please carry me
to the infirmary.

are on fire!

to this year's victors.

The Campers.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.295
(ALL CHEERING)

21:37.004 --> 21:38.297
Thank you!

21:38.297 --> 21:41.341
And this time
our winners' picture
will be mullet free.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.094
So, you'll have to
sit this one out,
Billy Ray.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.598
Matteo,
this belongs to you.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.309
The camper who
won it for us.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.269
Thanks!

21:52.602 --> 21:54.980
I'm so proud to have
this athletic cup.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.567
Let's just call it a trophy.

22:01.278 --> 22:05.907
Lydia, I hate to say this,
but you did a pretty good job
for a Weasel.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.659
Thanks.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.162
So, is there
anything nice
you wanna say to me?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
Nope.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.210
Here you go.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.546
Hopefully it brings
you more luck
than it brought me.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.007
(SIZZLING)

22:24.009 --> 22:26.261
You went through all that
just so you could throw
my pig's foot in the fire?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.263
It was totally worth it.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.557
That thing's been stinking up
the cabin all summer.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.894
I can't believe
I only have three more left.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.647
Hey!

22:38.023 --> 22:39.274
Has anyone seen Emma?

22:40.233 --> 22:41.276
Guys!

22:42.277 --> 22:43.570
Is the game over?

22:44.821 --> 22:46.198
Did we win?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.327
Oh!
Where did you come from?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.871
Don't you do it.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.915
No!

22:54.915 --> 22:55.957
No!

22:56.208 --> 22:57.918
(SPRAYING)
(EMMA SCREAMING)

22:57.918 --> 22:59.252
EMMA: Aw, right in my mouth!
