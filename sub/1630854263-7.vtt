WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:13.796
Ooh, come on, babe,
it's about to start.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.493
All right, here I come.

00:15.624 --> 00:19.889
I have my favorite sushi,
watching my favorite movie

00:20.020 --> 00:22.239
with my favorite girl.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.241
Oh, God is good.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.896
Why y'all got it
all dark in here?

00:27.810 --> 00:30.465
But the devil is busy.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.728
Ooh-ooh, sushi!
Don't mind if I do.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.077
I do mind if you do.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.166
And why do you smell
like Necie?

00:36.297 --> 00:38.603
Did you use my strawberry
mango body wash?

00:38.734 --> 00:41.302
Indeed I did.

00:41.432 --> 00:44.435
And my skin is
all nice and silky.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.568
By the way, we almost out.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.745
What the hell is that?

00:51.616 --> 00:53.183
Malcolm!

00:56.056 --> 00:57.622
Why is this front door locked?

00:57.753 --> 01:00.190
Open the door,
- it's your parents.
- Oh!

01:00.321 --> 01:01.670
Pillows.
Huh?

01:01.800 --> 01:04.064
My mama's pillows!
Oh, shoot.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.241
Uh, coming.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.460
Open the door,
this basket is heavy.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.549
Uh, okay.

01:14.726 --> 01:15.597
Are we good?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.077
We are good.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.862
Hey, hey, hey,
Mama, Daddy.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.385
Hey. Sorry to bother y'all,

01:21.516 --> 01:24.345
but your father hasn't
fixed our dryer yet.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.173
What's the rush,
when we can come over here

01:26.303 --> 01:29.393
- and use our spare one?
- Oh.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.656
Oh...

01:31.787 --> 01:35.138
I see y'all are loving
the pillows I got you.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.923
Loving 'em!
Loving 'em!

01:38.054 --> 01:40.404
I'll put those
in the dryer for you.

01:40.535 --> 01:43.625
Right now we're about to watch
our movie and eat our sushi.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.540
Ah, that's a great idea.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.498
Yeah, that is, but

01:47.629 --> 01:49.239
that's not enough food
for all of us.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.460
Uh, yes, because it's for two.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.201
Well, no worries.
You know what?

01:54.331 --> 01:55.245
I'll go whip something up.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.293
You know, times like these
is why it's good

01:59.423 --> 02:01.512
to have family
that live so close.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.905
Hey, Mama.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.559
Thought I heard your voice.
What's going on?

02:04.689 --> 02:07.083
I'm about to make tacos.
We're having movie night.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.304
Ooh, I am down
for a movie night.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.132
Yeah...

02:13.916 --> 02:16.745
Come on, man!

02:16.875 --> 02:19.051
I thought this was gonna be
couples only.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.358
Talk about not reading the room.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.014
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:25.145 --> 02:26.146
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:29.888 --> 02:31.542
Guys, look at this.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.023
Dave, why do you always get
so excited about the mail?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.677
It's nothing but bills and junk.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.114
Oh, really?
Well, don't come crawling to me

02:38.245 --> 02:39.985
when you need a walk-in bathtub.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.990
Wait a minute.
What's this from PaddiWak?

02:45.121 --> 02:46.731
What is PaddiWak?

02:46.862 --> 02:51.040
Well, it's like TikTok,
but from Korea instead of China.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.564
They sent Grover a check

02:53.695 --> 02:55.610
for $130.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.482
Cool! Can someone give me
a ride to the bank,

02:58.613 --> 02:59.962
and also explain how
cashing checks works?

03:00.092 --> 03:02.399
Okay, give me that.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.576
Why is Korea
sending you money?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.752
Remember when I said
I wanted those VR goggles?

03:07.883 --> 03:10.190
You said I have to save up
my own money for them?

03:11.016 --> 03:12.192
Vaguely.

03:12.322 --> 03:15.412
Well, I started posting videos,

03:15.543 --> 03:16.979
and I'm up to 12,000 followers.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.068
Money, money, money.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.245
Who said you could get
a PaddiWak?

03:22.376 --> 03:25.292
I did.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.339
Can I speak with you
over here for a minute?

03:31.689 --> 03:33.561
What's up?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.607
- What's up?
- Mm-hmm.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.131
Our son is making money
on the Internet, Dave.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.829
All the kids are on the app.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.614
And we did tell him to
start saving his own money.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.050
You know who else
makes money on the Internet?

03:45.181 --> 03:47.488
Fake Nigerian princes,

03:47.618 --> 03:49.838
and women who get paid
to take photos of their feet.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.492
Okay.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.624
Gemma, I think you may be
spinning a little bit.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.974
I need you
to back me up on this.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.455
I've never been to a bank,
but I bet it's closing soon.

04:01.023 --> 04:04.244
Dave, the Internet is not
a safe place for kids.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.942
I do not want our son
to be on PaddiWak.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.639
Okay. All right.

04:10.424 --> 04:14.079
Hey, buddy,
listen up. Uh...

04:14.210 --> 04:15.820
No more PaddiWak.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.822
What?! Why?

04:17.953 --> 04:19.955
Because...

04:20.085 --> 04:22.174
because I said so.

04:22.305 --> 04:26.266
Wow, you really have been
hanging with Mr. Calvin a lot.

04:28.659 --> 04:29.965
You better watch
your mouth, buddy.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.488
I brought you into this world,
and I will take you--

04:31.619 --> 04:34.796
Oh, my-- What am I
even saying?

04:36.885 --> 04:38.843
Calvin, I don't know
what happened.

04:38.974 --> 04:42.673
I just heard myself blurting
out, "Because I said so."

04:43.935 --> 04:45.589
Well, all right.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.809
That's what I'm
talking about, Dave.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.768
You see, Tina,
I <i>am</i> a good influence on him.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.294
Hey, y'all.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.730
- Hey, baby.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.646
Why do you smell like
tropical fruit?

04:58.776 --> 05:00.648
It, uh, turns out
Necie and I

05:00.778 --> 05:02.302
happen to share
the same body wash.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.915
Uh, can we get back
to my emergency?

05:07.045 --> 05:09.004
I don't want my little boy
making money on PaddiWak.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.919
There are a lot
of creeps out there.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.660
I know, but we told him
he could have those goggles

05:12.790 --> 05:14.314
if he made his own money.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.273
Okay, but a kid's first job
should involve more

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
than him using his index finger.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.582
A job should get him dirty.

05:21.712 --> 05:25.412
He should come home so funky
you don't want him anymore.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.851
You guys have got to
catch up with the times.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.070
Everybody is making money
on social media now.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.464
As a matter of fact,
I follow Grover.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.292
- He's pretty funny. Look.
- Oh, let me see.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.904
Dads be like,
"Clean up your room.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.907
Take out the trash.
I'm not gonna tell you again."

05:43.038 --> 05:45.867
Um, spoiler alert,
you are gonna tell me again.

05:49.044 --> 05:52.352
Moms be like,
"Eat your vegetables, baby.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.702
Do your homework.
How was school?"

05:54.832 --> 05:57.052
Um, you're the principal
at my school.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.271
You know how school was.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.404
Oh, that is funny.
He's right.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.710
You were there, woman.

06:04.755 --> 06:05.930
Oh, Malcolm, send me that.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.019
I want to follow him.
He's funny.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.893
And the boy got
a check for that?

06:12.023 --> 06:13.895
Oh, you'd be shocked at
what people get paid for

06:14.025 --> 06:15.549
on social media.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.811
Yeah, look, I'm fine with him
making his own money,

06:16.941 --> 06:18.943
but he should have
a real job, you know.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.163
One that teaches him
the value of hard work.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.251
But he's so young.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.993
Well, he's not that young.
He's 12.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.517
I was an industrial welder
when I was ten.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.478
No mask, no gloves, nothing.

06:33.393 --> 06:37.179
Yeah, my pops put me to work
at the Pit Stop when I was 11.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.225
Well, at least you learned
the value of hard work.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.576
I wish I'd learned
about child labor laws.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.494
Well, baby, why don't you
give Grover a job?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.931
Ooh, uh...

06:50.061 --> 06:51.715
Calvin, you would be doing us
a huge favor.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.500
Better being paid
under your supervision

06:53.630 --> 06:54.979
than on the Internet.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.852
Does he have <i>any</i>
work experience at all?

06:57.982 --> 06:59.549
Not in the traditional sense,

06:59.680 --> 07:01.856
but he did recently learn

07:01.986 --> 07:03.771
how to put a fitted sheet
on his bed.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.819
Okay, fine.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.256
But only for an hour
or two after school.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.606
Aw, thank you, Calvin.

07:12.736 --> 07:17.045
Uh, Dave be like,
"Let's hug it out."

07:17.175 --> 07:20.875
And Calvin be like,
"Nah, bruh."

07:22.964 --> 07:24.574
Oh, come on!

07:24.705 --> 07:26.837
You cannot fly a car
into a helicopter.

07:26.968 --> 07:30.101
I don't care how fast
or furious you are.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.713
Okay.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.410
Babe, I ran
five miles today.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.847
Would you give me
a foot rub, please?

07:36.978 --> 07:38.762
Of course, baby.
Give me those pretty feet.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.808
All right.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.680
Ooh, thank God.
That feels so good.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.073
Oh, you like that, baby?

07:45.203 --> 07:47.554
Yes.
Oh, yeah?

07:47.684 --> 07:50.861
Ooh...
Right there.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.602
- Yeah? Right there?
- Right there. Ooh!

07:52.733 --> 07:54.648
Right there.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.955
Baby, please don't stop.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.653
Hey, hey.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.485
I used my own key, that way
I didn't have to disturb y'all.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.964
Ah.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.140
How thoughtful.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.143
Uh, Marty, can you
take a look at this computer?

08:12.274 --> 08:13.623
This thing's been
going crazy on me.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
Dad, computers don't go crazy.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.322
They're not people.
They don't have emotions.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.150
Well, this one does.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.370
I was gonna take it
to the Geek Squad,

08:21.501 --> 08:24.025
and then I remembered
I made my own.

08:27.245 --> 08:30.510
Oh, hey, Necie.
How you doing?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.429
Grover.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.822
Grover, give me that.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.868
It's not a toy.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.478
All right? And you
still haven't swept up

08:42.609 --> 08:43.784
like I asked you to.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.743
All right. Yes, Mr. Calvin.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.144
Stop! Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.538
- Was I doing it wrong?
- Oh, very.

08:58.668 --> 09:02.498
Look, this is not about

09:02.629 --> 09:04.369
just pushing the dust around.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.198
All right? You want to
get it into a pile,

09:07.329 --> 09:11.202
and then sweep it
into the dust pan.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.682
All right?
Now, here, you try.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.336
Sure thing, Mr. Calvin.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.431
I mean, you could have
gone after some new dirt.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.217
Oh... okay, here.
Watch me.

09:26.348 --> 09:29.525
All right, it's all
in the wrist.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.397
See the wrist?
Look at that. Look at that.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.793
You get your wrist going,
get your action, move it around.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.360
Like that. Get that--

09:38.490 --> 09:41.232
Okay, put that phone away
and learn something here.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.062
Oh, Manny!

09:47.282 --> 09:51.025
My back. Ah.
My whole damn back.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.463
Who spilled oil
over here?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.857
I did. It's slippery.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.685
It's oil.

10:00.338 --> 10:03.385
- Ah, you okay, Manny?
- I don't know.

10:03.515 --> 10:04.734
Look, you're gonna
be fine, all right?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.214
Why don't you go
to the break room,

10:06.344 --> 10:08.085
take it easy for
a little bit.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.131
- Hey, put-put some butter on it.
- Butter?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.307
Yeah, and take some Robitussin.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.356
Okay, Grover, you know what?

10:18.487 --> 10:21.316
Why-why don't you just
take a break, too?

10:21.446 --> 10:23.448
Uh, is there anything else
I can do?

10:23.579 --> 10:27.061
Yeah. Go to my office,
put your hands in your pockets.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.498
I can't afford to lose
any more employees.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.157
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh!

10:36.287 --> 10:37.811
The working men
home from work.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.682
So, Grover,
how'd it go?

10:39.813 --> 10:41.249
I learned how
to sweep today.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.859
Ehh...

10:42.990 --> 10:45.383
"learn" would be
a strong word.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.431
Thanks for the lift,
- boss man.
- Sure.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.305
It seems like he had
a successful first day.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.046
Yeah, you know, Calvin,

10:56.177 --> 10:58.135
I-I just knew that Grover
would be a great help to you.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.747
Again, "help" would be
a strong word.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.924
Hey, wait.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.490
Mr. Calvin,
where's my money?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.710
It's not payday yet,
little man.

11:07.841 --> 11:08.842
So go on home now.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.239
So, how did Grover do?

11:15.370 --> 11:16.850
Well, I said I'd
teach him some things,

11:16.980 --> 11:20.070
and I'm trying, babe,
but every task for him

11:20.201 --> 11:22.725
ends up being more work for me.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.640
I think I'm gonna
have to let him go.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.470
You can't fire Grover
from his very first job.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.211
Come on, that would
just be wrong.

11:30.341 --> 11:33.954
Tina, he spilled oil
all over the floor.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.870
Manuel slipped in it,
and I think he's gonna sue us.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.306
Oh, Grover's ass gotta go.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.360
Calvin, Grover is
loving it here.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.623
Is he employee
of the month yet?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.800
No, he is not, Dave.

11:53.930 --> 11:57.151
Today I asked him
to clean out my mini fridge,

11:57.281 --> 11:59.806
and the boy drank three sodas.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.330
Uh, yes, can I help you?

12:02.460 --> 12:04.811
Are you Calvin Butler?

12:04.941 --> 12:07.509
Are you with
Child Protective Services?

12:08.684 --> 12:11.121
No, my "check engine" light
came on.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.863
And I saw your shop
on PaddiWak.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.258
My shop?
I don't think so.

12:17.388 --> 12:20.000
Come on.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.654
This is you, right?

12:35.319 --> 12:37.365
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah,
I mean, that might be me.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.149
Yeah, sure.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.672
So you're saying your
"check engine" light came on?

12:40.803 --> 12:43.240
Yeah, why don't you have a seat
and I'll be right with you.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.633
Come on, man.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.766
So he's back on PaddiWak?

12:46.896 --> 12:50.247
Yes, clearly. Calvin, you are
supposed to be supervising him.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.162
This is my fault?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.251
You never taught the boy
how to sweep.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.602
All right, where is he?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.344
Grover!

13:04.871 --> 13:07.177
Hey, Manny, you okay?

13:07.308 --> 13:10.093
My head, man.
My whole damn head.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.529
Grover, what are you doing?

13:11.660 --> 13:12.922
I was doing
the wrench challenge,

13:13.053 --> 13:15.055
and you distracted me.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.274
Calvin, I am so sorry.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.624
Look, Manuel, I'm sorry
about this, man.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.539
Why don't you just
go in the break room,

13:21.670 --> 13:23.193
take it easy a little bit.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.456
Turn the lights down,
and put some butter on it.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.632
- But it doesn't work.
- Eh, eh...

13:30.244 --> 13:31.767
Calvin, Grover is gonna
make this up to you.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.508
No, he is not.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.162
Grover, you're fired.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.034
Fired!

13:44.345 --> 13:46.129
Oh, my God!

13:48.001 --> 13:49.959
Whew! Y'all scared me.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.005
Can you make a little noise
when you come in?

13:52.135 --> 13:54.485
To our own house?

13:54.616 --> 13:57.314
Anyway, I was at
the farmers market,

13:57.445 --> 13:58.881
and guess what they had?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.492
Decorative gourds.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.886
Oh. Thank you.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.236
Yeah, we do love gourds.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.325
Yeah. I mean, like,
who doesn't?

14:09.849 --> 14:10.937
All right, I'll see you later.

14:11.067 --> 14:14.505
I'm sure we will.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.899
Marty, what are
we gonna do?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.248
Same thing we did
with the decorative pillows.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.076
Put 'em in the closet.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.734
Fired?!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.432
See, this is why I said
he was too young for a job.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.478
I was wrong,
you were right.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.001
He wasn't ready.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.961
I'm sorry, I'm just not good
at real work.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.747
I need a kombucha.

14:41.532 --> 14:44.100
- Sorry, Mom.
- You should be.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.189
I'm very disappointedin you.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.452
And you need to apologize
to Mr. Calvin.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.150
Yeah.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.500
And don't turn this
into one of those

14:52.630 --> 14:54.981
"Moms be like, I'm very
disappointed" videos.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.852
I won't.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.072
But that would be
a really good one.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.861
Calvin, I'm so sorry
about today.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.994
Me, too. Is Manuel okay?

15:08.124 --> 15:09.299
Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.693
Uh, he's getting
his sense of smell back,

15:11.823 --> 15:14.478
and he remembered his name. So...

15:14.609 --> 15:19.179
All right, the booch
cleared my mind. Hey, Calvin.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.268
Grover, we've come up
with a solution.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.573
We're gonna take away
your phone.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.401
No phone, no videos. Solved.

15:24.532 --> 15:27.491
Well, well, let's not
be too hasty.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.493
You know, I-I got great news.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.147
Remember the guy
that came in

15:31.278 --> 15:32.714
when I fired Grover today?

15:32.844 --> 15:37.023
Well, his kid saw my shop
on Grover's PaddiWak.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.025
Yeah, and we want to apologize
for that.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.157
Apologize? No, no.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.291
An hour later, two more
of Grover's followers came in,

15:44.421 --> 15:47.163
and one of 'em needs
a new transmission.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.165
That's a $5,000 job.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.084
Listen, Grover,

15:55.215 --> 15:58.609
when I yelled the words "fired,"

15:58.740 --> 16:01.003
at you earlier,

16:01.134 --> 16:03.049
what I meant was "promoted."

16:05.268 --> 16:08.445
You are now my new
social media director.

16:09.751 --> 16:13.015
Same pay, except for you get
a key to the vending machine.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.151
Calvin, I-I'm sorry,
but that's not happening.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.152
Why?

16:19.282 --> 16:20.762
Because I said so.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.765
Aw, come on, man, that sucks.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.986
It's not fair to use
my own words against me.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.554
Look, Calvin, I'm glad
it brought you some business,

16:30.685 --> 16:32.817
but Grover disobeyed us.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.429
I'm sorry, Dad, I really am,

16:35.559 --> 16:38.823
but you guys don't understand
what PaddiWak means.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.521
It's important to me.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.958
I know, everybody does it.

16:43.089 --> 16:46.135
It's not that, it's just
I'm in middle school now.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.050
It's different.
It's kind of hard

16:48.181 --> 16:49.660
to figure out where you fit in.

16:50.705 --> 16:51.967
Aw, Grover.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.578
And I'm actually good
at making videos.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.451
People think I'm funny now.
They like me.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.236
It's not so easy for me
to make friends, Dad.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.109
I'm not cool, like you.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.027
You're making it
real hard for me

17:08.157 --> 17:09.854
to be mad at you
right now, buddy.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.075
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:13.206 --> 17:16.774
Probably.
All right, look.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.734
Grover, you can go
back on PaddiWak.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.083
- Sweet!
- Yes!

17:21.214 --> 17:23.781
But... But...

17:23.912 --> 17:25.914
with conditions.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.350
I'm gonna want
your password.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.396
Sure. Yeah. That's fine.
That's good.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.964
And, and we have to approve
all of your videos. Deal?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.879
- Deal.
- Yeah, of course.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.229
Yeah, we're good with that.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.713
- Hey, Malcolm.
- Hey, what's up, Necie?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.193
Oh, hey, babe.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.194
- Hey.
- Oh.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.282
Excuse me.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.806
Okay. All-all right, baby.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.547
I-I'll be in there
in a bit.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, I'll-- Baby!

17:54.725 --> 17:56.988
Uh, what was that?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.382
Necie's not happy with
our living situation.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.558
I mean, it's hard enough sharing
a bathroom with me and you,

18:01.689 --> 18:03.647
but Mom and Dad have
absolutely no boundaries.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.171
That's a fact.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.564
Now with them drying
their laundry here,

18:07.695 --> 18:08.913
everything's getting mixed up.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.133
The other day,
Necie was this close

18:11.264 --> 18:12.569
from putting on Mom's thong.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.703
Hey, hey, Marty.
I don't need to know that.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.226
Yeah, I know. I know.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.836
Yo, man, don't ever say
"Mama" and "thong"

18:18.967 --> 18:20.490
in the same sentence.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.493
You heard it.
I almost <i>saw</i> it.

18:23.624 --> 18:24.929
Oh!

18:28.324 --> 18:30.544
Look, man, you have got
to figure out something.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.894
Okay? Necie's about
to be your wife.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.331
Look, I know. We gotta
get our own place.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.028
But I don't know how
to break it to Mom.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.769
You just got to
man up, little bro.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.120
You cannot be
afraid of her.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.208
If it was me,
I would tell Mama two--

18:42.338 --> 18:45.559
- Tell me what, Malcolm?
- Whoa! Why?

18:45.689 --> 18:48.518
Uh, I-I got nothing
to say to you, Mama,

18:48.649 --> 18:50.085
but, uh, Marty does.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
Come on.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.263
Hey, hey, good news.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.700
I found you a matching throw.

18:56.831 --> 19:00.313
Yay. Animal prints.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.967
Yes, it goes with the pillows
you love so...

19:03.098 --> 19:04.665
Where are my pillows?

19:04.795 --> 19:05.883
They in the closet.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.496
Nobody can see 'em in there.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.019
Exactly.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.544
Uh, Mama, we need to talk.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.808
Oh. Hey, Miss Tina.

19:17.939 --> 19:18.853
Hey, Necie.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.247
Come here, babe.

19:24.380 --> 19:28.515
Mama, I think it's time...

19:28.645 --> 19:33.128
No, I know it's time
Necie and I got our own place.

19:34.869 --> 19:35.957
Oh.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.525
All right. I get it.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.657
You do?

19:40.788 --> 19:43.791
Of course I do.
As a matter of fact,

19:43.921 --> 19:48.143
just today I saw the cutest
little craftsman house for sale

19:48.274 --> 19:49.971
right around the corner.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.192
- She doesn't get it.
- Yeah... no.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.237
Okay, Mama...

19:55.368 --> 19:56.673
What?

19:56.804 --> 20:00.721
You know, it might not be
right around the corner.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.897
We might need a little more
space than that.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.594
You know?

20:04.725 --> 20:05.900
Me and Necie are building
our life together,

20:06.030 --> 20:07.336
just like you and Dad did.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.208
I mean,
you've got to understand that.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.341
I guess.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.082
Come on, Mama, don't you
want us to be happy?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.737
You know I do.

20:16.867 --> 20:20.567
And maybe we are
a teensy bit intrusive.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.222
Well... I don't know...

20:24.266 --> 20:26.747
You two are terrible liars.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.576
But if you move far,
I'm telling you,

20:29.706 --> 20:31.665
you better save up
your gas money

20:31.795 --> 20:34.320
because you're coming home
on Sundays for family dinner.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.801
Mama, I wouldn't miss it.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.543
Listen, I'm always gonna
be your little boy.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.763
But right now I gotta be
Necie's grown man.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.025
Mm.
Yeah.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.157
- I like that.
- Yeah, you like that?

20:46.288 --> 20:47.811
Yes, I do.
God!

20:47.942 --> 20:49.291
Would you two get a room?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.641
We are in our house!
