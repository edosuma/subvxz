WEBVTT

00:20.520 --> 00:22.522
[deep breathing]

00:23.898 --> 00:25.692
[heartbeat quickening]

00:31.239 --> 00:33.241
[panting]

00:37.412 --> 00:38.329
[door opens]

00:51.051 --> 00:51.885
Miss Sharma.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.641
[Queen Charlotte] Viscount Bridgerton.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.685
We thought perhaps
you'd not be joining us.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.020
[Anthony] Your Majesty.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.355
Nothing could keep me
from my beautiful bride.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.110
[sighs deeply]

01:11.821 --> 01:12.864
Now,

01:12.947 --> 01:14.616
tell me of your wedding plan.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.078
There is no talk
of a special license, I would hope.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.246
-[laughter]
-Of course not, Your Majesty.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.666
I believe a modest family affair
would be most fitting.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.544
Perhaps back in the country,
at Aubrey Hall.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.046
[Queen Charlotte] In the country?

01:28.129 --> 01:29.005
[laughs]

01:29.881 --> 01:31.341
No, that will not do.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.843
You must have it here in town.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.472
In fact, I shall host the nuptials myself.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.308
-[Mary gasps] Oh.
-[Edwina laughs happily]

01:40.391 --> 01:42.602
-That is most generous, Ma'am.
-Most generous.

01:42.685 --> 01:45.188
-But not at all necessary.
-[Queen Charlotte] Nonsense.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.107
She is my diamond, after all.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.861
It is only right that I give you both
a wedding worthy of that title.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.115
Besides, one could almost credit me myself

01:55.198 --> 01:58.159
with bringing about
this most illustrious match.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.955
I shall oversee every detail.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.833
[quietly] Let that gossipmonger
try to get the better of me now.

02:11.589 --> 02:15.552
Can you believe it, Didi?
It is like a fairytale come true.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.512
[chuckles] You deserve nothing less, Bon.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.890
Nothing less for a true love match.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.100
[dishes clattering]

02:22.892 --> 02:24.853
My apologies, Your Majesty.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.490
[Lady Whistledown]
The frenzy of competition.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.035
The thrilling delight
of hazarding your all.

02:41.119 --> 02:45.915
I am referring not to the lure
of London's luxurious gaming halls

02:45.999 --> 02:49.127
but to a gamble with far higher stakes.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.920
Matrimony.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.091
For once that particular wager is placed,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.844
it cannot easily be undone.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.430
A fact which, I am sure,

03:00.513 --> 03:02.974
is met with both regret

03:03.057 --> 03:05.101
and sheer relief.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.145
â€¦and I shall sing between each one.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.646
For goodness' sake.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.983
Anyone would think our siblings had beaten
Napoleon himself on the battlefield

03:12.066 --> 03:14.986
instead of finding someone with whom
to dutifully march down an aisle.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.697
Indeed. With all the hubbub
about Prudence's engagement,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.699
my mama has rather forgotten I exist.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.744
She is quite happy Cousin Jack
has ensured our family's future.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.121
I must admit, so am I.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.122
[Prudence laughs]

03:26.206 --> 03:29.167
Mm. Don't touch. You can look at it.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.836
[Penelope laughs]

03:32.587 --> 03:34.797
And the baker is still awaiting payment.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.841
As is, apparently, the coalman.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.845
The new Lord Featherington was
supposed to restore our fortunes, and yet

03:40.929 --> 03:45.391
here I am, unable to scratch together
sixpence yet again.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.686
Our financial predicament is entirely
your doing, Lady Featherington.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.731
If you hadn't forced me
into this ill-starred engagement,

03:51.814 --> 03:54.651
we'd soon be living comfortably
on Miss Cowper's ample dowry.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.237
Oh, go on.
Blame me for taking you at your word

03:57.320 --> 04:00.323
when you spoke
of your great fortune in rubies.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.575
Had you thought to confide your plans,

04:02.659 --> 04:06.621
then I would not be considering dismissing
the servants that I have just rehired.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.582
All of that would be solved
if you would simply call off the wedding

04:09.666 --> 04:11.793
and allow me to set my cap
at Miss Cowper again.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.336
And leave my poor Prudence jilted?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.964
When her reputation's already
been called into question?

04:16.047 --> 04:18.007
No, it is far too late for that, my lord.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.385
No, you must continue in this engagement.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.971
I will think of something.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.847
Well, you'd better think fast.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.500
You must be one of our new fellows.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.585
Is it really so evident?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.629
Conserve that youthful vigor.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.382
Soon you shall be
just as jaded as the rest of us.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.552
After all, one form is much like another,

05:03.136 --> 05:04.178
do you not think?

05:07.015 --> 05:08.808
[lilting classical music plays]

05:20.320 --> 05:23.573
It is not yet right.
See how the cuffs are an inch too short?

05:23.656 --> 05:24.699
Very well, sir.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.159
[Violet] Hmm.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.245
There is plenty of time
to adjust it to your liking.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.039
The wedding is not for another month.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.750
-There is still much to do.
-Will Miss Edwina live with us?

05:33.833 --> 05:34.959
Indeed. After the wedding,

05:35.043 --> 05:37.628
she'll be the lady of the house
and responsible for you all.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.546
Lord, help her.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.923
Which reminds me, our carriages
must be polished to a shine,

05:41.007 --> 05:43.634
and the horses' manes braided.
We should bring out the finest silver.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.678
The queen may be hosting
everything at the palace,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.263
but we must be ready to entertain here.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.100
And what of us, Brother? Should we also
be polished and braided for the big day?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.518
[Anthony] We'll all be on display.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.396
Perhaps you might even
scrub your hands for the occasion?

05:55.480 --> 05:56.814
I've been occupied at the academy.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
-What about Miss Edwina's sister?
-What about her?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.486
Will she come to live with us, too?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.906
Oh, I do hope so. It'll be a boon to have
another intelligent woman in the house.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.492
Another? Mm. You're overcounting.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.078
Eloise, I shall need your help today.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.413
There is the dinner
to plan with Lady Danbury

06:12.497 --> 06:16.125
to welcome the Sharmas into the family.
And then the engagement ball next week--

06:16.209 --> 06:17.627
I am sorry, Mama, but, uh,

06:18.294 --> 06:21.047
I am attending a lecture
this afternoon. Flower arranging.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.048
[Eloise chuckles]

06:22.131 --> 06:23.925
Penelope's mama is forcing her to go,

06:24.008 --> 06:26.135
and you've wanted me
to find more ladylike pursuits.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.095
[chuckles]

06:27.762 --> 06:29.972
For how long have you cared
about flower arranging?

06:30.056 --> 06:32.225
I am an open-minded woman.
I can care about many things.

06:36.312 --> 06:39.190
I do wonder about the trim.
Is it too much?

06:39.273 --> 06:41.901
Nothing is too much
now that the queen is hosting.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
Let me show you the French tulle.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.571
[quietly] Oh yes.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.448
[exhales deeply]

06:50.243 --> 06:51.744
[breathes deeply]

06:51.828 --> 06:55.039
Did I tell you we will be married
by the archbishop himself?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.750
Several times.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.170
[sighs] We must find you a dress too.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.006
-I have plenty of dresses.
-[Edwina] This one must be special.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.301
After all, this wedding
is as much your triumph as mine.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.638
Whatever you said
to the viscount at Aubrey Hall, Didi,

07:10.721 --> 07:13.182
it clearly swayed him to declare himself.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.100
Iâ€¦ [chuckles]

07:14.183 --> 07:17.145
-I cannot claim credit.
-[Edwina] I shall bestow it, all the same.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.064
It will be so exciting living in London.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.109
The viscount said
there might even be snow this winter.

07:23.192 --> 07:26.696
-Won't that be exciting?
-You must enjoy it without me, Bon.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.073
Recall I am to set sail
soon after you wed.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.867
But you will return to visit, of course.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.786
[chuckles] And when the viscount
and I are blessed with children,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.913
you shall be
their favorite aunt. [chuckles]

07:36.747 --> 07:38.708
Think of us all together as a family.

07:41.127 --> 07:41.961
[Kate exhales]

07:42.044 --> 07:44.881
I do not know why
Miss Edwina's betrothal is so special.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.216
She's quite overshadowed my happy news.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.720
A fact we may well be glad of.
Put those silks down.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.889
Cotton will do for your trousseau.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.268
Has my maid yet delivered that dress
that needs altering, Madame Delacroix?

07:57.351 --> 07:59.187
[speaking French]

07:59.270 --> 08:00.188
[chuckles]

08:01.481 --> 08:04.984
[in English] I received your latest.
It's been a busy week, has it not?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
Indeed.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.323
The ton are quite ravenous
for news of the upcoming nuptials.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.158
Perhaps Lady Whistledown will report

08:12.241 --> 08:16.162
that I have been entrusted
with our diamond's wedding ensemble.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.123
Tell me, are my musings
not offering you sufficient business?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.249
Indeed.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.419
But why should there be limits
to a woman's ambitions?

08:23.503 --> 08:26.214
I would think you,
of all people, would understand.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.841
There is always more to be achieved.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.683
Thank you, Clara. That will be all.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.990
Lord Bridgerton?

08:53.574 --> 08:54.617
Miss Sharma.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.370
Lord Bridgerton and his guest are waiting.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.913
I see that. Thank you.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.414
This is the jeweler.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.209
We are here to have Miss Edwina's
betrothal ring altered to fit.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.044
[chuckles softly] My apologies,

09:05.127 --> 09:07.630
but my sister and my mother
have not yet returned home.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.007
Of course.
Then we shall trouble you no further.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.259
Is that cake?

09:11.884 --> 09:12.885
[Kate] It is indeed.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.387
-Lemon?
-[Kate] Pardon?

09:14.470 --> 09:17.139
I fancy a good lemon. [chuckles]

09:17.723 --> 09:18.808
[Kate sighs deeply]

09:21.227 --> 09:24.188
Might I offer you some refreshment, Mr.â€¦

09:24.272 --> 09:28.234
Brookes. Only if you insist.
I mean, it would be churlish to refuse.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.988
Tea, three spoons of sugar, and perhaps
some sandwiches too, thank you.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.075
[dish clattering]

09:53.551 --> 09:54.927
[Anthony breathes deeply]

09:59.599 --> 10:00.433
[exhales]

10:01.892 --> 10:03.853
It is fine weather
we are having, is it not?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.814
You wish to speak to me of the weather?

10:07.815 --> 10:10.401
Is there another topic of conversation
that'd be more appropriate?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.612
[exhales sharply]
There is nothing appropriate

10:12.695 --> 10:14.989
about what you're doing
proceeding with this engagement.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.783
On the contrary, I believe it is
the most proper outcome for all.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.411
Oh. And what of everything
that passed between us at Aubrey Hall?

10:20.494 --> 10:21.329
[Anthony sighs]

10:22.288 --> 10:23.914
Nothing passed between us.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.417
I am a gentleman.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.669
Is that so?

10:29.170 --> 10:32.673
Need I remind you, sir,
if anyone other than your sister

10:32.757 --> 10:37.637
discovered us in the library that night,
then we, too, would be obliged to wed.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.679
Nothing happened.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.391
Would the two of us being obliged to marry
be the outcome you desire?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.309
Of course not.

10:43.392 --> 10:47.647
Then let us both beâ€¦ glad
we have avoided such an unthinkable fate.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.067
[Mr. Brookes] I say, Miss Sharma,

10:51.150 --> 10:54.612
do you and your sister
happen to share gloves?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.072
I--

10:56.781 --> 10:58.199
Yes, on occasion.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.200
I knew it.

10:59.283 --> 11:02.036
I can take the measure
of a hand at 20 paces.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.664
We may use your finger to size the ring.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.916
-Oh, I beg your pardo--
-That shan't be necessary.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.084
[chuckling] Nonsense!

11:16.384 --> 11:18.260
Thank you. [chuckles]

11:18.344 --> 11:19.261
[sighs]

11:31.065 --> 11:33.067
[slow classical music plays]

11:34.860 --> 11:36.529
It is a beautiful piece.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.664
It is the ring my father gave
to my mother before they were wed.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.213
[footsteps approaching]

11:55.214 --> 11:58.300
-Lord Bridgerton?
-They came to, uh, alter the ring.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.844
Uh, Mr. Brookes insisted.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.222
[sighs sharply] Just a moment.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.517
It appears to be stuck.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.602
-Well, Edwina is here now.
-Yes.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.398
-[Edwina] Kate, are you--
-Yes, almost.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.150
[Kate grunts]

12:14.692 --> 12:15.860
[Kate sighs]

12:17.153 --> 12:18.446
[grunts] Just, uhâ€¦

12:19.071 --> 12:20.281
Just anotherâ€¦ [grunts]

12:20.364 --> 12:21.699
[chuckles] There.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.368
-All yours.
-[Lady Danbury] Ah.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.204
Here you all are.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.708
I have news.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.919
Lord and Lady Sheffield sent word

12:34.003 --> 12:35.629
they are in London.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.756
Our grandparents?

12:36.839 --> 12:39.592
Indeed. It seems they read
the engagement announcement

12:39.675 --> 12:41.510
and wish to make your acquaintance.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.346
And, uh, that of
your future husband, of course.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.058
-I should be delighted to meet them.
-They are already in town?

12:48.142 --> 12:51.395
They arrivedâ€¦ last night.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.899
-[Anthony] Is something wrong?
-Not at all.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.986
I shall invite them
to the engagement dinner tomorrow.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.530
I'm sure it will be a most joyous reunion

13:01.614 --> 13:03.574
after all these years.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.535
Yes, Lady Mary?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.703
Indeed.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.206
-Hmm. I shall look forward to it.
-[Lady Danbury] Ah.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.958
-Are you ready to promenade?
-I am, my lord.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.837
I suddenly feel a headache coming on.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.090
Lady Danbury, would you be so kind
as toÂ chaperone my daughter?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.383
Of course.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.386
Miss Sharma and I
would be glad of the fresh air.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.056
Oh, I should really stay with Mama.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.432
You will escort me.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.309
[sighs]

13:40.319 --> 13:42.238
[indistinct chatter]

13:42.321 --> 13:43.948
[children laughing]

13:45.533 --> 13:46.826
Whoa!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.285
[dog panting]

13:49.870 --> 13:51.664
I wish you every happiness.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.417
How could you invite
the Sheffields to dinner

13:55.501 --> 13:56.627
when you know full well

13:56.710 --> 13:59.463
the pain my mother has suffered
after their rejection of her?

13:59.547 --> 14:04.301
Indeed. Which is why I shall not
answer their impoliteness with my own.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.930
And besides, is this not
the reconciliation you wished for?

14:08.013 --> 14:10.599
Edwina returned
to the bosom of the Sheffield family

14:10.683 --> 14:13.018
to reclaim the fortune
you so desperately need?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.020
Yes, but not until after the wedding.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.857
Edwina is still in the dark
about the conditions of their favor.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.693
And if theÂ Bridgertons
were to learn of it, they might feel--

14:20.776 --> 14:24.572
As if you contrived a match
for your own concealed ends

14:24.655 --> 14:26.991
and might call off the wedding?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
I have to wonder if you might not secretly

14:29.952 --> 14:33.163
rejoice were the viscount
to break the engagement.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.374
Why would you ever say such a thing?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.920
They are betrothed.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.090
The viscount made a charming proposal,

14:43.173 --> 14:45.593
your sister gave her giddy acceptance,

14:45.676 --> 14:48.095
and in the eyes of society,
and, might I add,

14:48.178 --> 14:51.181
the Queen of England herself,
they are as good as wed.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.601
Only a very great scandal

14:54.184 --> 14:56.979
would prevent this marriage
from proceeding now.

14:57.062 --> 15:01.108
The kind of scandal that would
send alarms through the entire ton

15:01.191 --> 15:04.403
and be a stain from which
the penniless Sharma family

15:04.486 --> 15:05.821
would never recover.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.866
Only a fool
would jeopardize the marriage now.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.744
So I ask you,

15:13.162 --> 15:14.371
Miss Sharma,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.249
are you that fool?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.382
No.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.639
I did not think so.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.724
[Thomas] Lady Danbury.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.184
Mr. Dorset.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.938
-What a pleasure to see you here today.
-[chuckles]

15:39.021 --> 15:41.148
Miss Sharma, perhaps you would be so kind

15:41.231 --> 15:43.317
as to accompany me
on a turn around the lake?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.485
I am rather tired.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.111
She would be delighted.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.742
You're still angry with me
over that business at the races.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.077
I wish to apologize

15:53.160 --> 15:55.329
and throw myself at your mercy.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.292
Very well, my lord.
A turn would be most pleasant.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.173
[chuckling and indistinct chatter]

16:09.176 --> 16:10.928
[Edwina] What a handsome couple they make.

16:11.011 --> 16:11.887
[Violet chuckles]

16:13.681 --> 16:14.598
Pardon me?

16:15.432 --> 16:17.393
Mr. Dorset and my sister.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.771
I noticed that he was quite smitten
with her the last time they met.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.108
Perhaps he will convince her
to stay in England, after all.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.360
She barely knows the gentleman.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.321
Nor did I you, at first.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.074
But love moves swiftly, does it not?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.660
Miss Edwina,
you must tell me your favorite colors,

16:34.743 --> 16:36.537
so I may plan to incorporate them

16:36.620 --> 16:38.956
in the ornamentation
for your engagement ball.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.001
[Edwina, fading] You are too kind,
Lady Bridgerton.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.086
[slowed] I am certain
your taste is superb.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.046
[Kate laughing]

16:46.130 --> 16:47.172
[laughter echoing]

16:47.256 --> 16:49.675
[Violet] â€¦to honor both
Bridgerton and Sharma families,

16:49.758 --> 16:51.385
now that we are to be joined.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.928
[chuckles]

16:54.722 --> 16:57.641
-[fading in] Is that not so, Anthony?
-[normal] Absolutely.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.394
[chuckles]

17:04.231 --> 17:05.524
[Prudence calling out]

17:06.150 --> 17:07.443
Look at me!

17:08.944 --> 17:11.739
Your sister seemsâ€¦ happy.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.866
That is one way of putting it.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.285
The new Lord Featherington
seems an interesting fellow.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.162
A man of commerce, is he not?

17:18.245 --> 17:22.124
Yes. He has ruby mines in America.
They are flourishing, I hear.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.751
Perhaps I should introduce myself.

17:23.834 --> 17:28.338
After all, everyone else
is finding some purpose to their lives.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.465
Anthony is to be married.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.010
Benedict has his artistic pursuits.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.219
And, well,

17:34.803 --> 17:37.431
here I amâ€¦ feeding the ducks.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.225
-[quacking]
-I am sure the ducks are most grateful.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.063
You have a good deal of time and
plentiful opportunities to make your mark.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.273
As Eloise would no doubt remind me.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.901
Where is your sister?
I have not seen her out today.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.862
She mentioned something
about flower arranging

17:51.945 --> 17:53.822
with you today, in fact.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.325
Indeed. I am meeting her later.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.702
-Mr. Bridgerton.
-[Penelope] Mm.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.956
-[horse snorts]
-[Eloise grunts]

18:03.040 --> 18:04.333
This is the place.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.418
Doesn't look like
a place for shopping to me.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.504
[Eloise] I am collecting a unique gift

18:08.587 --> 18:11.465
for my brother's wedding.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.592
[woman] Miss? Miss!

18:21.016 --> 18:23.769
It is our right to be treated
not merely as chattels.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.064
Surely talk of rights
must draw on Locke's Treatise.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.482
You and your treatise!

18:28.565 --> 18:30.567
If you've ever worked
an honest day's labor,

18:30.651 --> 18:33.862
you know how little
such grand talk serves the working man.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.824
Now, if I may be permitted to continue,

18:36.907 --> 18:39.201
I should like to propose to this assembly

18:39.284 --> 18:43.372
the radical idea
that it is not best for women to rely

18:43.455 --> 18:44.915
for their education

18:44.998 --> 18:48.293
on what falls to them by chance
from their husbands and brothers.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.711
[crowd] Hear! Hear!

18:49.795 --> 18:51.463
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

18:51.547 --> 18:52.840
Is it not thrilling?

18:53.549 --> 18:54.383
You.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.634
Me.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.428
I told you, I don't know anything
about your Whistledown gossip.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.139
It is not her I seek today,

19:00.722 --> 19:03.267
but the exchange of ideas
with like-minded men and women

19:03.350 --> 19:05.769
on subjects beyond
the trivial concerns of polite society.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.689
Ideas that you yourself
invited me to consider.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.483
So, you're an admirer of my work?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.778
I would not go so far.
It is serviceable, I suppose.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.739
And yet you have come far.

19:18.824 --> 19:23.287
You're a long way from Mayfair
for writings that are merely serviceable.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.623
Luckily for me, there is
a thrilling invention called a carriage

19:26.707 --> 19:29.751
that may convey a lady
from one place to another.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.211
It is a marvel, to be sure.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.297
What's your name?

19:33.380 --> 19:35.007
[speaker continues indistinctly]

19:35.090 --> 19:37.551
-Eloise Bridgerton.
-Pleased to meet you, Miss Eloise.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.428
I'm Theo Sharpe.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.637
I know.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.889
You know?

19:44.224 --> 19:46.602
As I know, there are
several errors in your arguments

19:46.685 --> 19:48.270
that I must bring to your attention.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.857
Have you a pencil?
Never mind. You may borrow mine.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.194
[speaker] â€¦to marry you, did she not?
Allow me to continue.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.250
It is most refreshing on the water.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.420
These days, it is hard to find
even a moment of peace.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.006
One of the things
I enjoyed most when I visited India.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.009
Many think it a bustling, noisy place,

20:19.092 --> 20:22.137
but I found the country
most tranquil in nature.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.600
There's a river just outside
the home where I grew up.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.102
On hot days,
I would sneak away to soak my feet.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.355
The turtles and I
became quite good friends.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.606
Sounds idyllic.

20:32.689 --> 20:33.523
[Kate] It is.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.069
Which is why I'm counting the days
until I may return home.

20:38.028 --> 20:42.115
I had assumed you would remain in England
now that your sister is to be viscountess.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.702
My mother and Edwina will remain here.
I shall journey back alone.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.913
An adventure, indeed.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.332
You have plans for your arrival?

20:51.083 --> 20:54.586
I shall teach.
Become a governess, as you call it here.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.010
It will be most fulfilling.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.806
Enjoying an independent life,
running my own household.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.475
And perhaps playing host to old friends?

21:08.558 --> 21:11.019
I've long thought
to return to India myself

21:11.103 --> 21:15.023
since there is much to be learned
from their medical practice.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.067
[chuckles softly]

21:17.651 --> 21:19.861
If your travels do lead you there,

21:19.945 --> 21:22.990
then I would be most happy
to show you the places IÂ know.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.412
I should be working at the club, Alice.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.872
Not taking a stroll.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.249
This is work.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.544
We need more gentlemen members,
and here they are.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.045
Mr. Mondrich.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.047
Word of your prowess crossed the Atlantic.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.759
You got the better of McKellan
in just two rounds, is that not so?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.220
That was a long time ago.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.890
I've been known to plant
a few facers in the ring myself.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.811
Ah, but not up to your abilities,
I'm sure. [chuckles]

21:54.062 --> 21:56.648
You must pay a visit
to Will's club and talk more.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.027
You'll find it enlivening
and has a warm welcome for all.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.488
That may be the most
tempting invitation I've had in some time.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.199
Uh, Lord Featherington, a word?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.285
[Jack] Excuse me.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.204
Need I remind you that
the answer to our family's predicament

22:11.288 --> 22:14.708
will not be found disporting yourself
in places of public resort?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.753
Nor will it be solved by running up
yet more bills at the modiste.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.671
I just saw the latest accounts.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.299
You are supposed to
be finding a way out of this mess,

22:22.382 --> 22:24.259
not drowning us even deeper in debt.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.719
[quietly] Keep your voice down.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.304
Are you trying to ruin us all?

22:27.387 --> 22:30.640
Not when you are already
making such fine work of it yourself.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.351
[laughter and chatter]

22:42.235 --> 22:44.321
I see you are smiling, Didi.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.199
See the amusements London has to offer.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.576
There's water, too, in India.

22:49.659 --> 22:53.080
My sister spares no opportunity
to find reasons for me to stay.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.248
I may well join her in her endeavors.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.750
That knot will never hold.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.001
It is perfectly adequate.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.379
Then I must question
your nautical skills, Dorset.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.463
Allow me.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.132
-[sighs]
-[clattering]

23:07.260 --> 23:08.303
[Anthony] Pardon me.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.347
[dog barking]

23:14.267 --> 23:15.394
Miss Sharma.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.145
Lord Bridgerton.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.658
-[dog barks, yelps]
-[both shouting]

23:31.076 --> 23:32.619
[people gasping]

23:33.578 --> 23:35.914
-[shouts]
-[laughing]

23:37.958 --> 23:39.835
Oh my! Are you hurt?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.711
[laughs] Not at all!

23:41.795 --> 23:44.840
The water is a rather
welcoming refreshment,

23:44.923 --> 23:46.299
is it not,Â Bridgerton?

23:46.383 --> 23:47.759
Whoo! [laughs]

23:48.760 --> 23:50.470
[sighs] Refreshing indeed.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.309
Come now. It is not proper to stare.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.062
[grunts softly]

24:21.626 --> 24:23.378
Penelope, what are you doing here?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.297
I thought we were to walk,
as we usually do.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.882
My apologies. I had quite forgotten.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.178
Uh, wellâ€¦ you missed quite
the scene at the lake yesterday.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.054
My brother's impromptu swim?
I heard about it.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.306
[laughs] Where were you?

24:34.931 --> 24:39.686
Alas, I was forced to occupy my day
with tedious wedding errands,

24:39.769 --> 24:42.022
which Mama has listed me for yet again.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.149
I'm sorry,
but I cannot stroll with you today.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.444
-I shall see you tomorrow, then.
-Of course.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.996
Pardon me. Miss?

25:01.958 --> 25:05.587
Miss Eloise seems to have misplaced
her reticule when she was out yesterday.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.256
I'll be happy to retrieve it.
Where exactly did she visit?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.759
You'll not find it again, miss.

25:10.842 --> 25:14.137
I warned her, the streets
of Bloomsbury aren't fit for a lady.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.486
-What are you doing?
-Ah, Lord Featherington.

25:30.111 --> 25:33.990
Mr. Brookes here is just
taking a look at some jewelry for me.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.284
It is a fine piece, is it not?

25:37.160 --> 25:37.994
Indeed.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.955
Uh, this is not a good time.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.999
-He should return at another date.
-Nonsense. He's here now.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.918
And it is no trouble, is it?

25:45.001 --> 25:45.835
No.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.559
I was only planning
to have the jewels cleaned,

26:00.642 --> 26:03.645
but tell me, what might
a necklace such as that fetch?

26:04.604 --> 26:07.941
If it is of great value,
I shall have to take more care.

26:08.024 --> 26:13.280
Well, I would require my proper tools
for a definitive valuation,

26:13.363 --> 26:16.449
but I'd say you should
take very great care, indeed.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.369
It is rare to see stones this fine.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.789
Now, is that not something?

26:24.749 --> 26:27.961
Thank you for your expert services,
Mr. Brookes.

26:28.044 --> 26:31.756
I shall be in communication with you
should I require anything further.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.716
No cake, then?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.009
-Another time.
-Mm-hmm.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.140
Need I remind you, those are
as counterfeit as a two-pound note.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.725
Quality counterfeits.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.686
If they're good enough to fool
that nibbling owl of a man,

26:44.769 --> 26:47.022
then we may well make it
through the season yet.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.067
I do hope you know
what you're playing at. [scoffs]

26:55.322 --> 26:58.408
Well, there is no need to dismiss
any staff, after all, Mrs. Varley.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.703
Mm. Let us pray he's got
a whole trunk of them, ma'am.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.289
One bauble does not a fortune make.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.108
I declare, that's rather good.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.153
I am skilled at more
than simply standing naked,

27:35.236 --> 27:36.905
Misterâ€¦

27:36.988 --> 27:39.074
Bridgerton. I do not doubt it.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.076
Then perhaps inform the academy.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.828
Although two
of the founding members are women,

27:43.912 --> 27:46.373
we are still not yet allowed
to enter the classroom.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.042
At least, not while we are clothed.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.670
So you work as a model

27:51.753 --> 27:54.714
as a way of learning from the lectures?

27:55.382 --> 27:57.217
-Ingenious.
-Care to take a turn?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.844
It is harder than it looks.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.722
[Benedict inhales] Mm.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.892
[inhales sharply] Like so?

28:05.975 --> 28:07.060
[chuckles]

28:33.712 --> 28:35.046
[Benedict sighs deeply]

28:35.588 --> 28:37.048
How long must I stay like this?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.591
That depends.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.263
What I really need
is a study of the male form.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.014
The naked form.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.560
What say you?

29:05.660 --> 29:07.662
[water babbling]

29:10.415 --> 29:12.250
It is a lovely spot, is it not?

29:13.460 --> 29:14.919
It reminds me of the courtyard

29:15.003 --> 29:17.005
at the palace where we used to live.

29:18.631 --> 29:19.758
So calming.

29:22.051 --> 29:22.927
[exhales deeply]

29:23.011 --> 29:24.637
-Calming, yes.
-[chuckles softly]

29:33.646 --> 29:36.024
Nobody would blame you
if you were to take sick, Mama,

29:36.107 --> 29:39.527
and send apologies
for missing the dinner tonight.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.696
Lady Danbury has made it quite clear

29:41.780 --> 29:44.282
that it is necessary
for all of us to attend.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.247
When was the last time you saw them?

29:53.625 --> 29:57.253
The night your dear father asked
for my hand in marriage, I believe.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.838
Lord Sheffield made it clear,

29:58.922 --> 30:01.800
in no uncertain terms,
that he did not support the match.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.135
So I had a choice to make

30:04.844 --> 30:06.179
between my family

30:07.514 --> 30:08.348
and my heart.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.725
And did you ever regret that choice?

30:13.645 --> 30:14.604
[exhales]

30:15.230 --> 30:17.649
From the very first moment,

30:17.732 --> 30:19.984
your father and I were drawn together.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.403
It is a very powerful thing

30:22.487 --> 30:25.073
to meet someone
and feel that you know them.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.325
In a way unlike any other.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.285
[chuckles softly]

30:32.622 --> 30:35.458
Still a rather high price
to pay for love, I would think.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.794
Do not fret.

30:37.877 --> 30:41.381
Even my parents' presence cannot mar
the happiness that is the occasion.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.883
I had always hoped that you and Edwina

30:43.967 --> 30:46.427
would be spared the choice
between affluence and love,

30:46.511 --> 30:47.428
and now you shall.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.765
Edwina is to wed her heart's desire.

30:51.349 --> 30:54.227
And you have always wanted
nothing more than your freedom.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.896
[chuckles softly]

30:59.983 --> 31:01.234
Of course, Mama.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.987
We shall all be perfectly happy.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.911
-[knocking]
-[door opens]

31:15.915 --> 31:19.419
Lord and Lady Sheffield's return
is certainly a surprise. [chuckles]

31:20.211 --> 31:24.841
But it shall be pleasant to see
the family reconciled, willÂ it not?

31:24.924 --> 31:27.760
I will be finished in a moment, Mother.
We shall not be late.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.436
It is not that.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.814
[sighs] I have been watching you all week.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.317
I-- I told myself
I would support your choice,

31:42.400 --> 31:44.736
but I must admit,
I am finding it quite difficult

31:44.819 --> 31:46.279
to continue to stay silent.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.489
You have been anything but silent.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.783
This is your betrothal, Anthony.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
Your marriage.

31:53.202 --> 31:56.205
To the woman that shall replace me
as head of this household, might I add.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.374
You question Miss Edwina's
suitability for the role?

31:58.458 --> 32:01.252
I question the example
you are setting your siblings,

32:01.753 --> 32:05.673
marrying a woman for whom you clearly
hold no great tenderness or love.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.889
Why will you not accept that
the love match between you and father

32:12.972 --> 32:14.682
was the exception, not the rule?

32:14.766 --> 32:18.603
Because I wish for you two to know
the joy of an exceptional marriage.

32:19.145 --> 32:22.023
You should be excited to wed Miss Edwina,

32:22.106 --> 32:26.027
but for all I have seen, you act as if
you are approaching the gallows instead.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.446
If this is not what you want,

32:29.781 --> 32:31.574
you must say something now,
Anthony, before--

32:31.658 --> 32:33.284
What I want is beside the point.

32:35.828 --> 32:38.498
I could never dishonor
Miss Edwina by begging off now.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.750
You are right.

32:40.833 --> 32:43.127
A gentleman cannot take back his word.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.630
But a woman may.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.508
It happens all the time with young ladies,

32:48.591 --> 32:50.802
swept up in the dizziness
of receiving a proposal

32:50.885 --> 32:53.221
before the reality
of marriage becomes clear.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.265
If Miss Edwina were
to call off the engagement,

32:56.349 --> 32:58.184
no one would find fault with her.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.020
And you would not be dishonoring her
in the slightest,

33:01.104 --> 33:04.649
releasing her from the obligation
before any vows were exchanged.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.947
She does not wish to end the engagement.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.033
But does she know
your true feelings on the matter?

33:15.284 --> 33:16.661
My feelings are of no concern.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.914
What matters is my responsibility,
which has always been to wed.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.251
[softly] My darlingâ€¦

33:26.838 --> 33:30.591
If you have doubts,
do not simply set them aside.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.137
This is the most important choice
you will ever make.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.806
And it would break my heart

33:36.889 --> 33:40.018
to see you spend
the rest of your life in regret.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.648
I dare say it would break
your father's heart too.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.166
You seem distracted, Didi.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.167
[Kate sighs] Oh.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.002
It's, uh, just a headache.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.505
From, uhâ€¦
From all the excitement these days.

34:13.134 --> 34:17.346
Is that all that ails you? I have seen
how ill at ease you are with the viscount.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.893
I was hoping we had put all that behind us
now that Anthony is to be my husband.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.687
He's asked you
to call him by his given name?

34:24.771 --> 34:26.773
No, not yet.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.900
But it sounds fine, does it not?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.653
[sighs] Do you think
the Sheffields will like this dress?

34:32.737 --> 34:36.741
[giggles] My stomach is in a knot,
I am so excited to meet them.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.117
Before you do,

34:39.035 --> 34:40.745
there is something I must tell you

34:41.537 --> 34:44.082
about your grandparents,
and how they have, in fact,

34:44.707 --> 34:45.708
influenced our trip--

34:45.792 --> 34:48.461
Our guests have arrived.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.379
[giggles nervously]

34:50.463 --> 34:51.714
[Lady Danbury chuckles]

34:55.093 --> 34:57.261
You may spare me
the instruction, Lady Danbury.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.472
I know I am to be on my best behavior.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.434
You think me an unfeeling harridan,

35:04.268 --> 35:06.771
but perhaps it would surprise you to learn

35:06.854 --> 35:08.731
that I am hosting this dinner

35:08.815 --> 35:10.483
for your sake.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.152
Your sister's betrothal may be the end

35:13.236 --> 35:16.447
of certain hopes
you harbored regarding the viscount,

35:16.531 --> 35:19.867
but access to the Sheffield fortune

35:19.951 --> 35:23.246
would certainly be
a fine reward, would it not?

35:23.996 --> 35:27.917
A life of independence

35:28.000 --> 35:30.128
is no mere consolation.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.839
Indeed, many would think it
the better prize.

35:32.922 --> 35:37.093
After passion cools and fate intervenes,

35:37.885 --> 35:40.179
who else is a woman left with

35:41.013 --> 35:42.098
but herself?

35:45.434 --> 35:46.477
Hmm.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.354
Come along.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.606
Our guests are waiting.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.275
[Kate] Hmm.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.700
[Lady Danbury] Hmm.

36:02.243 --> 36:06.289
Ah, Lord and Lady Sheffield,
it has been too long.

36:06.372 --> 36:10.126
May I present Miss Sharma
and Miss Edwina Sharma.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.962
Oh, my dear, look at you.

36:13.045 --> 36:16.299
Isn't she quite
as lovely as the report said?

36:16.382 --> 36:17.466
[Edwina] You are too kind.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.928
I'm most happy to make your acquaintance.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.849
We have been waiting
so many years to meet you.

36:24.932 --> 36:27.518
I wish to know everything about you.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.770
Do you enjoy dancing? Music?

36:29.854 --> 36:31.480
You must accompany us to the opera.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.942
We have a fine box
which has been gathering dust.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.778
Indeed, it has been too long
since we've seen you both in town,

36:37.862 --> 36:38.905
Lord and Lady Sheffield.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.199
-Yes.
-[Lady Sheffield] Yes, indeed, it has.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.576
Mother.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.244
-Father.
-Mm.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.705
I do enjoy the opera.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.374
My sister Kate is the one
who introduced me to it.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.463
Ah. Shall we go through to dinner?

36:55.546 --> 36:57.381
Oh, yes. Come with me, child.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.299
[Edwina giggles]

37:04.472 --> 37:06.265
-[laughter]
-[silverware clinking]

37:06.349 --> 37:09.477
And, of course, you must be
our guests at the Sheffield manor.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.979
It is nothing compared
to the estates at Aubrey Hall,

37:12.063 --> 37:15.733
to be sure, but I think it
a most pretty part of Hertfordshire.

37:15.816 --> 37:19.946
Do you shoot? We have a fine stock
of birds, and you are always welcome.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.323
[Anthony] Thank you for the invitation.
I do enjoy shooting.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.532
[Lord Sheffield] Wellâ€¦

37:23.616 --> 37:24.659
As does Kate.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.745
The two of them almost bagged a stag
on our trip to the country.

37:27.828 --> 37:30.373
[chuckling] Howâ€¦ unusual.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.334
Do they teach
young ladies to shoot in India?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.127
Only the fortunate ones.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.546
[exhales]

37:38.756 --> 37:40.591
Uh, Lord and Lady Sheffield,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.843
how long do you plan to remain in town?

37:42.927 --> 37:44.762
Oh, we shall stay for the wedding.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.390
Imagine. The queen herself

37:47.473 --> 37:50.017
overseeing my granddaughter's nuptials.

37:50.101 --> 37:54.397
Her Majesty is kind to be so forgiving
after everything that has happened.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.149
[Lord Sheffield] Now, now.
We are all family here.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.567
Oh, yes, of course we are.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.612
Even after our daughter
so callously rejected

38:01.696 --> 38:03.322
the match we had found for her.

38:03.406 --> 38:07.410
-[Lord Sheffield] My dear, we agreed--
-An earl, no less, with 12,000 acres.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.370
Any other young lady

38:09.453 --> 38:13.666
would've fallen to her knees in gratitude
that her parents were showing such care.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.169
This sauce is delicious, Lady Danbury.
Have your cook give mine the recipe.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.088
It is the gooseberry, I believe.

38:19.171 --> 38:23.134
Lady Sheffield, you've got
quite the sweet tooth, I do recall?

38:23.718 --> 38:26.304
And all for what? A mere clerk, was he?

38:26.387 --> 38:29.765
And with a child
from a previous marriage to God-knows-who.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.017
My mother has a name.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.310
Lady Sheffield, I must ask--

38:32.393 --> 38:36.772
We could not show
our faces in society for years.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.607
Not that she should care.

38:38.691 --> 38:42.236
She simply sailed away
from all of us with that man,

38:42.320 --> 38:43.696
robbing us of our grandchild.

38:43.779 --> 38:44.864
Grandchildren.

38:46.615 --> 38:47.658
I have two daughters

38:47.742 --> 38:51.245
with whom you have had
every opportunity to form a connection.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.289
But the choice to shun us was yours alone.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.248
I beg your pardon--

38:54.332 --> 38:56.292
And do not think I took it lightly,

38:56.375 --> 38:58.794
being cast out
by the only family I had ever known.

38:58.878 --> 39:02.340
I was heartbroken, indeed.
But in time, I came to see

39:02.423 --> 39:05.134
that, in your cruelty,
you did us all a great service.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.762
I hardly think this
a proper dinner conversation.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.430
I quite agree. Please, collect--

39:09.513 --> 39:12.016
When you cast me out,
what you did was set me free.

39:12.725 --> 39:16.520
Free to raise my daughters
far from your constant judgment

39:16.604 --> 39:19.482
and craven demands
that they should chase wealth

39:19.565 --> 39:21.776
and titles above all else!

39:21.859 --> 39:24.403
[scoffs] You are a fine one to talk.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.740
You speak of scorning riches,
and yet you have come crawling back

39:27.823 --> 39:29.283
to snatch at our fortune.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.994
-Lady Danbury is right--
-Believe me, I want nothing from you.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.372
Oh, you may not,
but your daughter certainly does.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.583
Mama?

39:37.666 --> 39:42.129
The trust fund we have set up for her.
The condition of which clearly states

39:42.213 --> 39:46.926
that she must marry a man
of good English breeding to inherit.

39:47.802 --> 39:51.389
You did not think we would allow
another generation to pollute

39:51.472 --> 39:52.890
the Sheffield name, did you?

39:52.973 --> 39:55.434
Didi, what are they talking about?

39:55.518 --> 39:58.020
-What have you done?
-Anthony, did you know about this?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.022
I shall explain everything.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.567
I see this one has inherited
your penchant for avoidingÂ the truth.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.569
Or that's something
she inherited from her father.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.779
[Anthony] That is enough.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.825
I can only think
you've been exiled from good society

40:10.908 --> 40:13.202
because of your deficient manners
rather than any other sin.

40:13.285 --> 40:16.038
Since the moment you arrived,
you have failed to show the proper respect

40:16.122 --> 40:18.082
for the Sharma family,
and I will not stand for it.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.584
-I declare--
-I will notâ€¦ stand for it.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.004
Lady Mary has done admirably
in raising her daughters.

40:24.088 --> 40:28.300
They are intelligent, kind, loyal women.

40:28.884 --> 40:30.511
And a credit to both their parents.

40:31.637 --> 40:35.808
And since you clearly do not wish
to jeopardize your social standing

40:35.891 --> 40:38.727
by associating with such company,
I suggest you do not.

40:38.811 --> 40:39.937
You may leave at once!

40:40.020 --> 40:41.689
You cannot be serious!

40:41.772 --> 40:43.816
Please send for Lord
and Lady Sheffield's carriage.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.109
They can wait outside.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.446
And do not trouble yourselves
for an invitation for the wedding,

40:48.529 --> 40:50.448
for you shall not receive one.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.284
This is beyond the pale.

40:54.785 --> 40:58.664
And if you think
you shall inherit a single sovereign now,

40:58.747 --> 41:00.458
you are sorely mistaken.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.560
Lord Bridgerton, Lady Bridgerton.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.395
-I must apologize--
-We should take our leave.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.438
[Violet] Yes.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.608
Thank you for the evening, LadyÂ Danbury.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.485
It was quite enlightening.

41:27.568 --> 41:28.569
[grunts] My lord--

41:28.652 --> 41:30.029
Good evening.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.282
-You lied to me.
-Please, Bon.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.879
Lord Bridgerton!

41:48.255 --> 41:50.591
Lord Bridgerton, I beg a word!

41:51.717 --> 41:53.260
-We must be going.
-Please.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.262
[breathing heavily]

41:56.180 --> 41:57.932
Mother, I shall meet you at the house.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.278
You must know. Edwina is innocent
in all of this. She had no idea.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.156
Coming to England, finding her a match.
I only wished the best for her.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.700
-You cannot be angry at her.
-I am not.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.662
It is clear she was as much in the dark
as I was about your schemes.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.872
-They were not schemes.
-I take it there'll be no dowry.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.999
Now that the Sheffields
have withdrawn their support.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.251
You care about a dowry?

42:25.334 --> 42:28.671
It is because of what you just did
that theÂ Sheffields withdrew it.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.131
It is regrettable, to be sure.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.801
But clearly, both Miss Edwina
and I have been misled,

42:33.884 --> 42:35.970
and it is best to call off
this doomed engagement

42:36.053 --> 42:37.972
before it is the cause of any more strife.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.432
Of course, I'd never
besmirch her reputation.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.518
My mother and Lady Danbury
will make a plan--

42:42.601 --> 42:45.646
There shall be no plan.
I do not understand.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.940
Why are you suggesting this?

42:48.023 --> 42:50.526
All along, you have been set
on marrying my sister,

42:50.609 --> 42:52.861
despite my every objection, might I add,

42:52.945 --> 42:55.030
and now you intend to cast her aside.

42:55.698 --> 42:56.657
Why?

42:56.740 --> 42:59.410
And do not talk to me of dowries, sir,

42:59.493 --> 43:01.579
for we both know you have no need of it.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.247
So, tell me, what has she done?

43:03.330 --> 43:06.709
She has done nothing. It is you.
You have made this match impossible.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.628
-But I am leaving for India.
-And it is not far enough!

43:12.131 --> 43:14.717
Do you think that there is
a corner of this Earth

43:14.800 --> 43:17.011
that you could travel to far away enough

43:17.094 --> 43:18.596
to free me from this torment?

43:19.388 --> 43:20.723
I am a gentleman.

43:21.724 --> 43:25.102
My father raised me to act with honor,
but that honor is hanging by a thread

43:25.185 --> 43:27.021
that grows more precarious
with every moment

43:27.104 --> 43:28.731
I spend in your presence.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.860
You are the bane of my existence.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.868
And the object of all my desires.

43:42.828 --> 43:45.831
[quietly] Night and day, I dream of you.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.459
And what Iâ€¦ [exhales]

43:50.336 --> 43:53.672
Do you even know all the ways
a lady can be seduced?

43:55.966 --> 43:57.843
The things I could teach you.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.845
[both breathing heavily]

44:00.346 --> 44:03.932
[quietly] I did not ask for this.

44:05.017 --> 44:07.728
[sighs] To be plagued by these feelings.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.023
Hiding from my sister.

44:12.441 --> 44:15.653
Being driven to distraction
every time you enter the room.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.279
Then you agree.

44:18.697 --> 44:20.240
It is insupportable.

44:21.450 --> 44:22.743
Impossible.

44:22.826 --> 44:25.245
[heartbeats thumping]

44:29.416 --> 44:30.668
[Kate exhales]

44:37.466 --> 44:41.637
If I wed your sister, it will bind me
and you together for eternity,

44:41.720 --> 44:44.848
and I will spend every day of my marriage

44:45.474 --> 44:47.267
wanting you,

44:47.351 --> 44:49.061
dreaming of you,

44:49.937 --> 44:52.981
dreading the day when my last thread
of honor finally snaps.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.027
Is that the future that you want for us?

44:57.111 --> 44:58.278
For your sister?

44:58.946 --> 44:59.863
[exhales]

45:01.156 --> 45:02.658
[distant chatter]

45:04.952 --> 45:05.994
I must go.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.510
[exhales sharply]

45:29.309 --> 45:31.562
[sighs] Must we sit around like statues?

45:31.645 --> 45:35.733
I wish to be at a ball,
showing off my new fiancÃ©.

45:36.775 --> 45:37.693
Varley?

45:39.027 --> 45:40.654
Are you certain we've not received

45:40.738 --> 45:43.824
any invitations you may have
overlooked for the evening?

45:43.907 --> 45:46.326
No, ma'am. There's been nothing.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.872
Perhaps the circumstances of Prudence's
engagement has us on the outs yet again.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.206
So this is my fault?

45:51.290 --> 45:52.458
I did not say that.

45:52.541 --> 45:55.794
It's not as if you arranged to meet
Cousin Jack in that orangery, did you?

45:55.878 --> 45:59.590
We should merely be happy we still have
a cook and a lady's maid each, yes, Mama?

46:10.434 --> 46:13.520
Not a single invitation
since arriving back from the country.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.439
I shall alert the postal clerk.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.065
This is no joke.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.444
We are meant to be a distinguished family.

46:20.527 --> 46:24.198
But for years, I have suffered
the indignities of the ton's disdain,

46:24.281 --> 46:25.657
for one reason or another.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.076
They liked us well enough
when they thought you a plum catch,

46:28.160 --> 46:31.079
but now that you are spoken for,
ah, we are outcasts again.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.832
All the more reason to end
this sham of an engagement.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.667
It is not an option.

46:40.088 --> 46:41.048
Lord Cowper.

46:41.965 --> 46:43.509
What business did he have with you?

46:43.592 --> 46:46.136
He wishes to invest in the mines.
Several of them do.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.514
Bored gentlemen with too much time
and money on their hands.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.516
-Take it.
-The mines are worthless.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.059
There are no rubies to be found.

46:52.142 --> 46:54.853
How are they to know the difference?
Board a ship to the Americas?

46:54.937 --> 46:56.480
[chuckles, inhales]

46:58.649 --> 46:59.817
You are serious.

46:59.900 --> 47:03.320
The future of this family
hangs in the balance, my lord.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.781
I've never been more serious in my life.

47:05.864 --> 47:09.701
Get them to invest.
Take every pound that they offer.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.995
Our fortunes will be restored.

47:12.079 --> 47:13.956
Prudence shall have a fine wedding,

47:14.039 --> 47:17.251
and I shall never have to suffer
the disdain of the ton again.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.394
-[knocking]
-Edwina?

47:49.491 --> 47:51.660
Ever since the viscount
has been courting me,

47:51.743 --> 47:53.954
I have sensed
you were not being entirely truthful.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.623
And now I know I was right.

48:04.673 --> 48:07.676
This business with the Sheffields
and their fortune,

48:07.759 --> 48:11.096
you did not trust me enough
to tell me what was really going on.

48:11.179 --> 48:14.850
I am truly sorry, Bon, for keeping
both you and Mama in the dark.

48:14.933 --> 48:16.226
After Appa died,

48:16.310 --> 48:19.438
I took it upon myself
to manage our affairs.

48:19.521 --> 48:23.650
I wrote to the Sheffields,
and after learning of their stipulations,

48:23.734 --> 48:26.945
I saw an answer to all our troubles.

48:27.487 --> 48:29.406
I thought I was doing the right thing

48:29.489 --> 48:31.533
by keeping you free from this burden.

48:31.617 --> 48:32.910
But you must know,

48:34.036 --> 48:36.204
it has weighed on me every day.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.710
I am not a little girl anymore, Kate.

48:42.502 --> 48:45.547
I am a grown woman now,
ready to be a wife.

48:47.507 --> 48:48.467
Yes.

48:49.593 --> 48:50.886
Yes, I know.

48:52.054 --> 48:53.138
[sighs softly]

48:56.516 --> 49:00.437
If Lord Bridgerton does not wish
to end our engagementâ€¦

49:01.980 --> 49:04.816
then the Sheffield fortune
would not matter, would it?

49:04.900 --> 49:06.985
Once I am married to the viscount,

49:07.069 --> 49:09.488
there will be ample funds
to provide for all of us.

49:09.571 --> 49:11.657
He is as generous as he is wealthy.

49:12.282 --> 49:16.119
I am sure the viscount
will provide for you and Mama too.

49:17.621 --> 49:18.497
Heâ€¦

49:20.123 --> 49:21.083
He might.

49:21.833 --> 49:25.253
But-- But, Edwina,
this should not be your burden.

49:25.337 --> 49:29.341
What burden would it be
to marry the person I love?

49:30.926 --> 49:32.010
You love him?

49:32.719 --> 49:37.224
Watching how nobly he defended us
at dinner tonight, how could I not?

49:39.142 --> 49:43.313
I want nothing more than to be his wife.

49:44.272 --> 49:45.899
His viscountess.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.486
But he will have to forgive us.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.572
Do you think he will?

49:53.949 --> 49:55.409
That I do not know.

50:14.344 --> 50:15.554
I shall not be long.

50:22.227 --> 50:24.563
Do not tell me
you've traveled at this ungodly hour

50:24.646 --> 50:26.314
to offer more corrections of my writing?

50:26.398 --> 50:28.900
It was the only time
I could leave without being seen.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.235
And, on the contrary,

50:30.318 --> 50:32.571
I've come to ask for your discernment.

50:32.654 --> 50:33.822
Is that so?

50:33.905 --> 50:35.282
Do not look so pleased.

50:35.365 --> 50:38.201
It is a rare occurrence
that I doubt shall be repeated.

50:39.411 --> 50:42.414
[sighs] I have questions
about the writings in this pamphlet.

50:42.497 --> 50:45.375
Well, the ideas can tax a fragile mind.

50:45.459 --> 50:48.879
Or perhaps your means of communicating
them leaves much to be desired.

50:48.962 --> 50:52.257
Or perhaps you have not seen enough
of the world to make sense of them yet.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.800
[Eloise chuckling] Ah.

50:56.553 --> 50:57.804
[Lady Whistledown] Duty.

50:57.888 --> 51:01.308
More than laws or faith,
I have often thought it the bond

51:01.391 --> 51:04.144
that holds our fragile society together.

51:14.988 --> 51:17.657
Duty to rank and title.

51:17.741 --> 51:20.494
Fidelity to one's family name.

51:20.577 --> 51:23.538
It demands both utter obedience

51:23.622 --> 51:26.124
and total sacrifice.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.088
But what happens

51:31.171 --> 51:32.839
when such duty

51:32.923 --> 51:35.884
is in conflict
with the heart's true desire?

51:37.427 --> 51:39.638
Why, then, there is the potential

51:39.721 --> 51:42.390
for a considerable scandal, indeed.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.394
The only question is,

51:46.478 --> 51:50.315
will the parties in question
heed my warning?

51:50.899 --> 51:52.776
Or is it already too late

51:52.859 --> 51:54.945
to turn back to duty

51:55.028 --> 51:57.531
and away from desire?

51:57.614 --> 52:00.826
[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" plays]

52:00.909 --> 52:03.245
[breathing deeply]

52:13.880 --> 52:15.048
[horse snorts]

52:15.132 --> 52:15.966
Miss Sharma.

52:16.049 --> 52:18.426
I see you continue here
with your morning rides.

52:19.678 --> 52:21.346
As do you, it seems.

52:25.058 --> 52:26.059
I couldn't sleep.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.394
[quietly] Nor could I.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.689
Have you decided what you will do?

52:36.278 --> 52:38.864
Long have I wrestled with it,
but I see no other option.

52:41.199 --> 52:44.119
I will talk with Miss Edwina todayâ€¦

52:45.996 --> 52:47.497
and see my way to ending things.

52:47.581 --> 52:48.957
It is the only way to ensure

52:49.040 --> 52:51.459
that the two of us can be rid
of this impossible situation.

52:52.043 --> 52:55.505
Once the engagement is over,
our paths need never cross again.

52:58.466 --> 53:00.468
It will be as if we had never met.

53:03.597 --> 53:05.599
You cannot. You cannot do that.

53:05.682 --> 53:08.226
-Miss Sharma--
-You cannot break my sister's heart.

53:08.310 --> 53:11.855
She is all things good and true.
A kinder soul you will never find.

53:11.938 --> 53:14.316
She has loved me
as well as any sister could,

53:14.399 --> 53:16.276
and I could not live with myself

53:16.359 --> 53:18.778
if I robbed her of her happiness
and the future she deserves.

53:19.362 --> 53:20.906
I-- I do not understand.

53:20.989 --> 53:23.366
You have been
against this union from the start.

53:23.450 --> 53:27.537
I was wrong! I will not be
the cause of you losing your honor

53:27.621 --> 53:29.915
any more than I can stand
to see Edwina in pain.

53:30.498 --> 53:32.083
You once saw her as your perfect match.

53:32.167 --> 53:34.002
You will find your way
to believing it again.

53:35.170 --> 53:36.046
Please.

53:36.546 --> 53:38.340
Please, LordÂ Bridgerton.

53:39.090 --> 53:39.925
Anthony.

53:40.508 --> 53:42.928
You must keep your word.
You must marry my sister.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.888
You must marry her as soon as you can,

53:44.971 --> 53:47.807
because this feeling
that plagues us so, it will pass.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.185
It will become tenable,
it will become bearable,

53:50.268 --> 53:53.021
and soon enough,
it will be as if we never felt it at all.

53:53.104 --> 53:55.941
Mere passion. It must because it has to.

53:56.024 --> 53:58.610
[classical rendition of
"You Oughta Know" continues]

53:58.693 --> 53:59.527
[sighs]

54:09.537 --> 54:10.372
Very well.

54:17.003 --> 54:19.506
I shall see that the wedding
shall take place as soon as possible.

54:42.862 --> 54:44.864
[sighs deeply]

54:47.117 --> 54:48.368
[sniffles]

54:48.451 --> 54:49.494
[exhales sharply]

54:49.577 --> 54:51.329
[breathes deeply]
