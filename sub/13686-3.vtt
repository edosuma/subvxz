Previously on
"Ex On The Beach."

00:03.536 --> 00:06.072
So far, five exes
have arrived.

00:06.139 --> 00:09.209
And Taylor's ex, Andre,
has been sent packing.

00:09.275 --> 00:11.444
Chris had words
with his ex, Chelsko.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.914
{\an4}How you treat women...
It's not okay.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.914
{\an3}Ugh!

00:14.981 --> 00:16.916
And how you treat men
is perfectly fine, right?

00:16.983 --> 00:19.953
{\an5}(announcer)
Angela and Derrick went down
to the Shack of Secrets

00:20.019 --> 00:21.454
where couples get closure.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.690
And Angela's suspicions
were validated.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.859
{\an1}This just proves that you
talked to mad bitches.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.395
Ding! Validation complete.

00:28.461 --> 00:31.664
{\an8}(announcer)
And tonight, Faith gives
love a shot with Tor'i,

00:31.731 --> 00:34.434
{\an8}despite him being
in a relationship with Angela.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.869
Ahh!

00:35.935 --> 00:37.504
{\an5}(announcer)
A trip to
the Shack of Secrets

00:37.570 --> 00:40.173
threatens to tear
Cory and Taylor apart.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.909
Oh, my God.

00:42.976 --> 00:46.579
{\an5}(announcer)
And at elimination,
all hell breaks loose.

00:46.646 --> 00:48.782
Ooh, I swear!
Don't say (bleep) to me!

00:52.252 --> 00:55.688

00:55.755 --> 01:00.193

Welcome back to
"Ex On The Beach."

01:08.468 --> 01:11.171
Ten reality
and social media stars

01:11.237 --> 01:15.141
thought they were coming for
the ultimate singles getaway.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.243
But their exes had other plans.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.611
Here's what you missed.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.414
Chase's ex, Skyler,
ruined the connection

01:21.481 --> 01:22.849
that Victoria had with Chase.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.785
Chris and his ex, Chelsko
squashed their beef

01:25.852 --> 01:27.554
and are working
on their relationship.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.789
Taylor and Cory
are all loved up

01:29.856 --> 01:33.259
now that Taylor's ex, Andre
got the boot last night.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.696
And Angela continues
to fall hard for Tor'i.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.199
{\an1}I'm not just trying
to take that bikini off.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.434
{\an1}I mean, although,
although...

01:41.501 --> 01:43.470
{\an1}although,
it would be quite nice.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.338
{\an1}I want that.
I want to treat you

01:45.405 --> 01:47.841
{\an5}how you deserve
to be treated.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.841
You gotta take me out
to dinner first.

01:47.907 --> 01:50.243
{\an5}(Angela)
Tor'i is such
a beautiful soul.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.278
{\an8}And he's honest
and open with me,

01:52.345 --> 01:55.448
{\an8}something that I never got with
Derrick or anyone else.

01:55.515 --> 01:58.852
So, that alone made
me fall for him.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.055
Hi.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.223
(laughing)

02:03.289 --> 02:05.124
{\an5}What you getting ready--

02:03.289 --> 02:05.124
(laughing)

02:05.191 --> 02:06.693
What you getting
ready for?

02:06.759 --> 02:08.228
{\an8}Tor'i is sexy.
He is very sexy.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.729
{\an8}I told him that.
He knows that.

02:09.795 --> 02:14.067
I need to go get my birthday
suit on, like, yo, ay.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.135
(laughing)

02:16.202 --> 02:17.670
{\an8}Faith is amazing,
beautiful, like...

02:17.737 --> 02:19.839
She a real down-to-earth chick,
I like her a lot.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.809
{\an8}(Faith)
We need to
talk more, Mister...

02:22.876 --> 02:24.711
{\an8}(laughing)

02:24.777 --> 02:25.645
{\an7}What's up?

02:25.712 --> 02:27.413
{\an8}It was...
(laughing)

02:27.480 --> 02:30.917
{\an8}What's going on?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.917
{\an7}Nothing.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.452
{\an5}(Faith)
Tor'i is really
interesting to me.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.287
{\an8}'Cause, you know,
he's very flirtatious.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.788
But if Bad Girls Club
sees that,

02:35.855 --> 02:38.224
then it could
be an issue, you know?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.766
{\an8}You know, right now, my future
with Taylor looks good.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.601
{\an8}We got Andre
out of the house.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.837
{\an5}When I told her
about my daughter,
she's never backed down.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.339
{\an1}And what's crazy is my
daughter is one month older

02:53.406 --> 02:56.442
{\an4}than my
new sister.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.442
God.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.444
{\an5}(Cory)
You know, at this point,
Taylor showed me a lot.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.446
I'm ready to pursue
something with her.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.882
{\an8}Like, I really wanna
date her after this.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.183
{\an8}I want something to happen.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.753
{\an1}(Cory)
I appreciate you.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.489
{\an5}(announcer)
With all this talk
of new arrivals,

03:09.556 --> 03:11.658
I think it's time that
we have a new arrival.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.527
Check out the flag pole to see
if your face is on the flags.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.697
You need to head to the beach
because the next exes

03:17.764 --> 03:21.234
are about to come ashore
and bring the pain.

03:22.802 --> 03:26.472
{\an5}(women)
Oh, oh, oh...

03:22.802 --> 03:26.472
Oh, my God!

03:28.641 --> 03:30.310
(woman)
Who is it?

03:30.376 --> 03:33.012
(man)
Jasmine.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.380
{\an8}(bleep, laughs)

03:34.447 --> 03:36.316
{\an8}I knew what's coming,
but I just didn't think

03:36.382 --> 03:37.784
today was gonna be the day.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.218
So, I'm a little,
like, taken back.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.987
Ah (bleep).

03:41.054 --> 03:42.655
(woman)
Chris again?

03:42.722 --> 03:45.625
(Chris)
(bleep) two times in a row?

03:46.859 --> 03:48.227
{\an8}(sighs)

03:48.294 --> 03:49.629
{\an8}This is not Gucci.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.197
They're trying
to (bleep) me up, man.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.332
(woman)
It's Cory at the top.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.535
{\an5}Oh, yeah!

03:52.398 --> 03:55.535
That's Cory! Cory!

03:55.602 --> 03:57.103
(Tor'i)
Are you ready, dude?

03:57.170 --> 04:00.707
{\an5}(Cory)
I don't know
what's gonna happen, man.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.742
{\an8}I think the ex for me that's
coming is probably Alicia.

04:02.809 --> 04:06.412
{\an8}You know, I feel like that's
the most recent ex for me.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.014
We just ended things
two weeks ago.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.249
We broke up just because it
wasn't there anymore.

04:10.316 --> 04:14.587
She told me she loved me, like,
a week ago, two weeks ago, bro.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.724
{\an1}I'ma feel weird, like,
being around Taylor

04:17.790 --> 04:19.959
{\an1}with her in the house,
man, it's gonna...

04:20.026 --> 04:21.226
It's gonna be weird.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.262
{\an8}If she sees me
and Taylor together,

04:23.329 --> 04:25.932
{\an8}she's gonna be heartbroken.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.700
{\an5}(announcer)
Looks like Cory's
feeling the heat

04:27.767 --> 04:30.236
about his ex, Alicia,
possibly showing up.

04:30.303 --> 04:33.840
Maybe stepmom in training,
Taylor's handling it better.

04:33.906 --> 04:37.777
{\an5}(Taylor)
I don't wanna see Alicia.
I know it's her coming.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.246
(sniffling)

04:40.313 --> 04:41.481
Are you okay?

04:41.547 --> 04:43.149
I just, I (bleep)
hate this bitch.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.951
(sniffles)

04:45.018 --> 04:47.453
{\an8}Me and Alicia
don't like each other.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.922
It started off on
"Are You The One?"

04:49.989 --> 04:53.626
Alicia was with Andre
before I was with Andre.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.729
And when me
and Andre started dating,

04:56.796 --> 04:59.399
that was a whole big issue.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.833
{\an1}You're not the only
person that has beef.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.835
It's just gonna be so bad
and I'm just, like,

05:02.902 --> 05:04.270
not (bleep) ready for
this stress right now.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.039
It's gonna be so bad.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.775
{\an5}(announcer)
Angela and Taylor
aren't the only ones struggling

05:08.841 --> 05:10.810
with the idea
of more exes coming.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.647
It looks like Chris and Chelsko
are also having trouble coping.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.115
(Chelsko)
How you doing?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.484
{\an1}Like, I don't know (bleep)
but my face is up there again.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.186
I think it's gonna be Haley.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.188
{\an1}That's the only ex
that I can think of.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.657
{\an5}(Chelsko)
Chris has an inkling
that it's gonna be Haley.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.125
{\an8}She may have beef with me

05:26.192 --> 05:28.828
{\an8}because I'm the reason
that they broke up.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.998
And now, I don't want this
jeopardizing us.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.499
I still have
feelings for Chris....

05:33.566 --> 05:35.268
{\an1}If it's her, you know,
I don't know if, like...

05:35.334 --> 05:39.305
{\an5}So, you're concerned
you would, like,
do something with her?

05:39.372 --> 05:41.507
{\an8}Chelsko and I,
we hashed it out.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.043
But I love Chelsey
as a friend, nothing more.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.315
(announcer)
Tensions are running high.

05:49.382 --> 05:51.484
Taylor and Chelsko
are freaking out

05:51.551 --> 05:54.053
and new exes
haven't even arrived.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.992
{\an5}(Chris)
You guys ready
for this (bleep)?

06:00.059 --> 06:03.262
{\an5}(Cory)
I mean, as ready
as you can be, right?

06:03.329 --> 06:06.032
{\an8}I'm a little nervous, excited,
but we're gonna find out

06:06.099 --> 06:07.500
{\an8}whose ex is on that beach.

06:07.567 --> 06:11.270
{\an5}What's going on?
What's going on,
everybody?

06:11.337 --> 06:12.672
{\an8}Welcome back to the beach.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.140
Now y'all know
what the deal is?

06:14.207 --> 06:17.543
You thought you were here
for a dream vacation.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.480
{\an5}Your exes are
crashing a party.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.480
God.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.850
{\an5}Cory, you look
a little nervous
right now, my brother.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.853
{\an5}I'm nervous, bro, I'm shaking.
Like, I can't-- I can barely
talk to you right now.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.555
It's now time to see
which one of your exes

06:29.622 --> 06:31.057
will be joining the party.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.925
Ohh...

06:35.361 --> 06:36.562
(Chris)
I already got one in the house.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.031
I don't need another one,
honestly.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.869
I'm so nervous 'cause I know
every time someone

06:42.935 --> 06:45.772
{\an8}new comes in here, it just
blows up like an explosion.

06:46.839 --> 06:50.176
I'm just praying
it's not Alicia.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.646
{\an8}I got something with Taylor.
I'm not trying to ruin it.

06:58.317 --> 07:02.622
♪ I'm making trouble ♪

07:02.688 --> 07:04.924
Hey!
♪ Well, I'm making trouble... ♪

07:04.991 --> 07:08.060
{\an5}Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:04.991 --> 07:08.060
You're (bleep).

07:08.127 --> 07:11.130
{\an8}I am Haley and I am Chris's
ex-girlfriend.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.432
I get a lot of attention
when I go out.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.768
But it's usually
from (bleep) boys, so...

07:15.835 --> 07:17.403
Chris and I dated
for about six months

07:17.470 --> 07:20.807
and then it ended up ending
because he started hanging out

07:20.873 --> 07:22.108
with his ex-girlfriend,
Chelsko.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.110
♪ Uh-uh, oh,
I'm making trouble... ♪

07:24.177 --> 07:26.078
I do still have
feelings for Chris.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.680
It was kind of unfinished
for me.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.618
{\an5}Hey!

07:30.483 --> 07:32.618
Hi.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.454
I'm honestly
happy to see you.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.390
Chelsko's gonna freak out.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.791
{\an5}I'm happy you're here.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.791
{\an3}Yeah?

07:38.858 --> 07:40.426
{\an8}I was the one that
cut it off with Chris.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.728
It was kind of a...
We were just arguing every day

07:42.795 --> 07:46.632
because Chris lied about
talking to his ex-girlfriend,

07:46.699 --> 07:47.934
talking to other girls.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.403
And at that point,
it kind of needs to end.

07:50.469 --> 07:52.572
This is one of the
nicest exes arrivals

07:52.638 --> 07:54.040
{\an5}we've had so far.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.040
{\an1}Yeah.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.075
And honestly, that's
what I like to see, man.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.276
I really do
like to see that.

07:57.343 --> 07:58.778
I need them vibes.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.313
{\an8}When Haley came out the war,
I feel, like, the vibe

08:00.379 --> 08:02.215
{\an8}she was giving me was really
good and passionate.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.418
Chelsko, she walked
in here with a mission

08:05.484 --> 08:07.486
of revenge to bash me.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.856
Like, I'm happy.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.391
(Romeo)
Cory and Jas...

08:12.458 --> 08:15.661
Y'all must got a lot
of good luck at the beach

08:15.728 --> 08:17.496
because for now,
no more exes.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.699
{\an5}(Cory)
Right now, you know, I don't
have any exes in the house.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.234
{\an8}I just wanna be with Taylor

08:21.300 --> 08:23.970
{\an8}and ride off into the sunset.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.973
Chris, Haley, I'ma give
y'all a little bit

08:27.039 --> 08:28.441
of one-on-one time
at the crib.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.742
Let's go enjoy the
rest of the day.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.977
{\an5}Let's go.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.977
Let's do it.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.678
{\an5}All right, bro.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.678
Let's do this (bleep).

08:32.745 --> 08:35.081
♪ Rumble, rumble
like an earthquake ♪

08:35.147 --> 08:37.082
♪ Feel the ground shake... ♪

08:37.149 --> 08:38.717
{\an5}(Haley)
Yeah, no,
I'm happy I was here.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.519
{\an8}If I was to be in a relationship
with Chris again,

08:40.586 --> 08:42.421
{\an8}I would need to see
that he's changed.

08:42.488 --> 08:45.091
{\an5}You know, he did lie to me
about hanging out with
his ex-girlfriend.

08:45.157 --> 08:49.528
And I would need him to make it
apparent that I'm above Chelsko.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.430
{\an1}At first, yeah, it kind of broke
my heart, like, how (bleep)

08:51.497 --> 08:54.467
went down, but, like, maybe
we can work up a friendship.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.903
{\an1}Maybe we can, I don't know,
go to something else, you know?

08:56.969 --> 08:58.704
Like, you know, I'm,
I'm completely open

08:58.771 --> 09:00.539
to possibilities,
you know, like...

09:00.606 --> 09:02.642
{\an1}And I'm not gonna
turn anything down.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.010
I'm happy you're here.
I really am.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.913
The past year,
you've been a really big,

09:06.979 --> 09:08.681
like, part in my life,
you know?

09:08.748 --> 09:12.118
{\an4}So, like, to have you
here kind of brings back
some memories, you know?

09:12.184 --> 09:14.186
{\an1}When I drove to your
house, you were, uh...

09:14.253 --> 09:15.955
{\an1}kind of, like,
really close to being...

09:16.022 --> 09:17.857
{\an1}Yeah, and you're still, like,
"Oh, I still love you."

09:17.924 --> 09:19.859
Um, can I say I still do?

09:19.926 --> 09:22.561
{\an5}Well, I figured, you know?

09:19.926 --> 09:22.561
{\an1}(laughing)

09:22.628 --> 09:26.332
{\an1}Let's go inside, come on,
let's go, come on.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.972
{\an5}Ah (bleep), got real...

09:29.835 --> 09:32.972
{\an3}Oh, boy!

09:33.039 --> 09:35.374
We're back!

09:35.441 --> 09:37.777
Hey!

09:37.843 --> 09:38.844
(all cheering)

09:38.911 --> 09:40.746
{\an5}You guys are alone!

09:38.911 --> 09:40.746
We're back!

09:40.813 --> 09:43.549
{\an5}(Taylor)
Cory comes back,
he has no ex with him.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.318
{\an8}Thank you, God.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.419
We're back.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.554
No!

09:48.621 --> 09:50.623
{\an5}It's Haley?

09:48.621 --> 09:50.623
{\an1}Yeah.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.059
I'm gonna be right here
when she walks in!

09:53.125 --> 09:54.827
Just reminding her
how hot I am.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.295
How would you feel
if they started to, like,

09:56.362 --> 09:57.897
rekindle things?
'Cause that's kind of like

09:57.964 --> 09:59.231
{\an5}the vibe I'm getting.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.231
{\an1}Yeah.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.033
Honestly, like,
I don't think he would.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.169
{\an5}I don't know...

10:01.100 --> 10:03.169
{\an1}I don't know, y'all,
you'll see...

10:03.235 --> 10:06.305
'Cause he loves me.
He (bleep) her.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.773
He loves me.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.075
Say that again.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.043
That's fighting
words.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.012
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up... Cory and Taylor

10:13.079 --> 10:15.715
{\an8}take a surprise trip
to the Shack of Secrets.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.985
Oh, my God.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.721
(announcer)
And will a new couple emerge?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.522
(shrieking)

10:23.589 --> 10:26.692
{\an5}(announcer)
Or will it all go to hell
when Angela finds out?

10:26.759 --> 10:29.862
Ooh, I swear! I swear!
Don't say (bleep) to me!

10:37.603 --> 10:39.271
At the boy, Chris!

10:39.338 --> 10:42.742
(all cheering)

10:42.808 --> 10:44.777
(excited chatter)

10:44.844 --> 10:47.179
Hi, I'm Haley.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.549
(crosstalk)

10:50.616 --> 10:52.551
{\an5}(Derrick)
Haley walks in the house
and I'm, like,

10:52.618 --> 10:54.253
{\an8}damn, Chris, okay.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.655
{\an8}Got two exes here, I can hit
on one of 'em, at least.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.460
Chelsko, you met already?
Y'all said hi?

11:01.527 --> 11:02.962
We know each other.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.066
{\an5}(Chelsko)
Of course, it's a little
intimidating, a little scary.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.302
{\an8}It's a weird situation to have
two exes in the same house.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.442
{\an8}I don't think that Chelsko's
competition to me because

11:16.509 --> 11:18.811
Chris, he's always made it very
clear that I would

11:18.878 --> 11:21.981
be a first choice
where she is second.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.419
Here's my only thing.

11:26.485 --> 11:29.922
You choosing which one
of us is gonna stay.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.158
{\an4}I need some
time to think.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.158
If you have to choose--

11:32.224 --> 11:33.993
{\an1}If you can let me finish.
You just asked me a question.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.461
It's not just my choice.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.763
I'm not asking about them.
I'm asking about you.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.031
{\an1}Can we, can we just
talk about this later?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.366
{\an1}'Cause I'm trying
to get lit.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.301
Yeah, go.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.406
{\an1}Gucci Gang...
(laughing) Gang.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.412
{\an5}(loud whirring)

11:50.409 --> 11:53.412
Uh-oh.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.651
(man)
Whoa!

11:58.717 --> 12:00.252
Oh! Message
in a bottle!

12:00.319 --> 12:02.922
Oh, boy, hold on!

12:02.988 --> 12:04.490
Whoa, message
in a bottle!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.759
{\an4}(Tor'i)
Hold on, here we go.
Let's see what this is about.

12:06.826 --> 12:07.893
Okay, go ahead.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.295
"Cory and Taylor have been

12:09.361 --> 12:11.630
keeping things steamy
since they got here."

12:11.697 --> 12:13.099
(all)
Ooh...

12:13.165 --> 12:16.502
"Let's see if a trip
to the Shack of Secrets

12:16.569 --> 12:18.737
can bring things
to a full boil."

12:18.804 --> 12:22.141
(all cheering)

12:22.208 --> 12:25.811
{\an8}Usually, every time someone goes
down there, it's been bad.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.413
{\an8}But from this note
it might be good.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.948
I'm just praying it's good.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.584
Let there be a bed down there
and some rose petals.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.786
(whooping)

12:35.588 --> 12:38.491
{\an5}(all)
No, no, no.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.491
It's all good.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.359
{\an8}Me and Cory have gone through
a had time in this house,

12:40.426 --> 12:43.362
{\an8}you know, but, we wanna
be together and...

12:43.429 --> 12:45.297
{\an8}We're good right now.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.800
So, I'm excited
to have one-on-one time.

12:47.867 --> 12:51.403
All right! Get it in!
(laughing)

12:51.470 --> 12:53.305
{\an3}Have fun!

12:56.809 --> 12:57.877
(Taylor)
Oh, my God.

12:57.943 --> 13:02.248
{\an1}(Cory)
Oh, my God.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.501
{\an5}(Cory)
My worst nightmare
has happened.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.204
{\an8}I'm going down there
with the person I'm with.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.173
And my ex is right there.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.345
I'm Alicia.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.881
{\an8}People know me from
"Are You The One?"
as a man stealer.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.550
{\an8}Anything negative, of course.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.251
Those days are long gone.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.887
My last relationship
would be with Cory.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.489
And we just broke up
two weeks ago.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.591
He pretty much told me that
I was everything that he wanted.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.127
But he didn't feel anything
toward me anymore.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.462
I hope I can rekindle
things with Cory.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.898
Because I love Cory,
I really do.

13:52.965 --> 13:57.503
Oh, my God, I totally thought
this was not the case right now.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.637
Did you guys
hook up?

13:58.704 --> 14:01.140
No, we haven't,
I mean...

14:04.310 --> 14:05.811
{\an1}We've kind of been
into each other.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.847
{\an1}We kind of started
something and...

14:11.450 --> 14:13.852
{\an8}If I still loved Alicia,
I would be with Alicia.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.355
She loves me,
and I can't say it back.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.157
So, it's tough.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.241
I'm not watching
this (bleep).

14:38.377 --> 14:41.347
{\an5}(Cory)
This is so (bleep) up.
This is so (bleep) up.

14:41.413 --> 14:44.016
I've done nothing
but support you.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.118
And be there for you.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.224
It's not even like that.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.362
{\an5}(Alicia)
You're a father now.
Your daughter's going

14:56.428 --> 14:58.430
{\an8}to have you watch you push
someone who you claim

14:58.497 --> 15:01.867
{\an8}is so (bleep) perfect
for you away, for what?
For some easy (bleep)?

15:01.934 --> 15:03.369
Knowing you have
a bigger picture.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.537
I would think that you would
wanna put your head somewhere

15:05.604 --> 15:07.573
to fully understand, okay, let's
maybe see if this could work...

15:07.640 --> 15:09.275
{\an5}My head is there.
Stop saying my head
isn't there.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.110
{\an5}My head is always
on the bigger picture.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.110
{\an1}Okay.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.779
{\an5}You can already say.
She already knows
that I have a daughter.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.182
{\an5}(Taylor)
I'm just stressed out because,
like, I don't wanna lose Cory.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.685
{\an8}I like him a lot, I want--
I wanna see where this goes

15:19.752 --> 15:24.056
{\an8}with him and this is rock bottom
I think for us.

15:24.123 --> 15:27.026
Like, I don't think
it could get much worse.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.362
{\an1}I feel like
a (bleep) idiot!

15:30.429 --> 15:32.931
Oh, my God.

15:46.011 --> 15:50.149
(loud whirring)

15:52.351 --> 15:54.687
{\an5}Who is that?!

15:52.351 --> 15:54.687
Who is that?!

15:54.753 --> 15:57.089
{\an8}(announcer)
If you don't know Alicia,
you will now.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.424
{\an8}Taylor doesn't like Alicia

15:58.490 --> 16:00.592
{\an8}because she used
to date her ex, Andre.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.796
{\an8}And until a couple of weeks ago,
her current man, Cory.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.031
{\an8}And Angela
also doesn't like Alicia

16:06.098 --> 16:08.000
{\an8}because she hooked up
with her ex, Derrick.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.102
{\an8}So, take it away, Angela.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.805
{\an8}It's Alicia.

16:12.871 --> 16:15.908
And all I see is red.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.943
Cry... cry about it.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.912
Let her cry about it.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.481
{\an8}Surprise, bitch!
Alicia is here!

16:22.548 --> 16:27.486
{\an8}Oh, my God. Somebody's wings
about to get smashed, man.

16:27.553 --> 16:28.754
{\an8}Oh! This is crazy.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.157
{\an5}(Angela)
Cry about it!
Cry about it!

16:32.224 --> 16:34.927
This is gonna be fun,
ladies and gentlemen!

16:34.993 --> 16:37.429
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

16:34.993 --> 16:37.429
{\an5}I will always come at you!

16:37.496 --> 16:40.332
{\an8}(announcer)
Will Alicia survive
the wrath of Angela?

16:40.399 --> 16:42.468
Will Tor'i survive the
wrath of Angela?

16:42.534 --> 16:45.537
(bleep) Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

16:45.604 --> 16:48.607
{\an5}(announcer)
Will Angela survive
the wrath of Angela?

16:48.674 --> 16:52.745
I said I'm done!
Please send me the (bleep) home!

16:57.116 --> 16:58.484
(announcer)
Alicia left the Shack of Secrets

16:58.550 --> 17:01.053
trying to escape
from Cory and Taylor.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.390
But unfortunately for her,
she ran right into

17:04.455 --> 17:07.626
a big, bad brick wall
named Angela.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.762
{\an5}(Derrick)
Oh, my God,
Oh, my God.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.297
I (bleep) knew it! After
everything she did to (bleep)...

17:12.364 --> 17:13.665
She deserves that (bleep)!

17:13.732 --> 17:15.334
I don't know what
the (bleep) problem is.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.770
The last time we saw each other,
we had beef or whatever

17:17.836 --> 17:19.938
but it was literally
a whole big misunderstanding.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.707
A misunderstanding?

17:21.773 --> 17:23.876
{\an5}(Derrick)
Angela thinks that Alicia
and I were hooking up

17:23.942 --> 17:25.411
{\an8}when me and Angela were
something.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.146
One night in New York,
they fought.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.216
{\an1}You came into our room
and gave me an attitude!

17:31.283 --> 17:32.418
I did not give
you an attitude!

17:32.484 --> 17:34.520
{\an5}And gave me an attitude!

17:32.484 --> 17:34.520
I really didn't.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.089
(loud, angry crosstalk)

17:37.156 --> 17:39.491
{\an5}(bleep)

17:37.156 --> 17:39.491
...Talking about you.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.593
That's why I came
at you like I did!

17:41.660 --> 17:43.362
And that's why I'm always
gonna come at you!

17:43.429 --> 17:46.331
{\an5}Oh, my God... okay.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.331
I will always come at you!

17:46.398 --> 17:49.401
{\an8}Angela popping off looks like
someone who just freshly

17:49.468 --> 17:51.537
{\an8}did their makeup to make
sure if I'm gonna hit you,

17:51.603 --> 17:53.705
{\an8}I'm gonna look
really good doing it.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.474
I don't have time for this.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.210
{\an5}(Angela)
That's why she's (bleep) crying.
She deserves this (bleep).

17:58.277 --> 18:00.112
Cory and Taylor
are so happy right now,

18:00.179 --> 18:01.780
and I'm happy for them.
Let her cry about it.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.450
{\an6}Hi, my name
is Jasmine.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.450
Hi, I'm Alicia.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.985
To me, but, uh, heard
a lot about you.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.055
{\an5}(Tor'i)
When I see Angela popping off,
I don't like that at all.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.558
{\an8}I don't wanna have to put up
with this day in and day out.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.326
I'm an adult, I don't have
time for this (bleep).

18:14.393 --> 18:15.961
You know what I mean?
Like, I just, I don't.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.463
And even this
right here is sad.

18:17.529 --> 18:20.032
He should be ashamed
of himself, honestly.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.338
{\an6}You okay?

18:24.203 --> 18:26.338
(bleep)

18:26.405 --> 18:28.106
{\an5}You good?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.106
(bleep)

18:28.173 --> 18:29.975
Cory, you good?

18:30.042 --> 18:32.711
{\an8}Kind of feel bad for Cory.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.681
{\an5}I know Cory and Taylor
really trying to get
their (bleep) together.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.517
{\an8}Alicia in the house is not gonna
make that easy for anybody.

18:41.386 --> 18:44.456
Let me talk to you.
Let me talk to you.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.758
{\an5}Oh, he's talking
to her right now.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.758
Yeah.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.363
You know, he's outside
talking to her, Cory?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.032
He's outside talking
to her right now.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.300
He just walked
downstairs with her.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.035
So, this is my thing.

18:57.102 --> 18:59.471
{\an1}I never wanna
disrespect you.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.173
{\an1}You never did
anything wrong to me.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.675
I never once threw
dirt on your name.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.644
Anything like that.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.613
She came in that elevator.
I just saw a hot body, like...

19:07.679 --> 19:09.147
She came in all white
looking like an angel

19:09.214 --> 19:11.016
but she might be the devil.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.152
{\an1}I've been telling everybody you
did nothing but hold me down.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.954
{\an1}You did nothing but
buy my daughter clothes

19:16.021 --> 19:17.689
and help me out.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.695
Still not good
enough, so...

19:23.762 --> 19:27.533
I really had a glimmer of hope
that Cory was just...

19:27.599 --> 19:30.035
{\an8}gonna feel the same
way that I did.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.037
And clearly just
out the window.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.540
And I feel like an idiot.
An idiot is someone who does

19:34.606 --> 19:36.708
the same things over and over
and expect different results

19:36.775 --> 19:38.911
and that's exactly
what the (bleep) I did.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.312
{\an1}That's how
it is sometimes.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.114
{\an1}When two things don't work,
it's usually one person

19:42.180 --> 19:43.982
{\an1}is not feeling the other
person the same way.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.953
And it sucks because then I'm
the dick that has to tell you

19:48.020 --> 19:49.254
it's not gonna work out.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.223
And then you're the one
that gets heartbroken.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.993
{\an4}And I'm trying to find that
happy between because I still
respect you as a person.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.695
You just want me to leave
so you can have your fun.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.730
Nuh-unh, I'll make this
(bleep) hard for you now.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.832
{\an5}Jesus Christ.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.832
{\an1}You can't make
(bleep) hard for me.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.435
{\an1}Yeah, cause you're a heartless
piece of (bleep) clearly.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.637
{\an1}No, because I'm looking
out for you.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.106
I'm not trying to do this
(bleep) in front of you.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.308
{\an5}I'm looking out for you.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.308
So then stop it!

20:09.374 --> 20:12.911
{\an4}No! That's
what's happening.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.911
{\an3}Exactly.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.347
{\an5}So, you're gonna put
yourself in a position
to watch this every night.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.317
{\an5}You're gonna put yourself
in a position to be bullied
on every day.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.452
{\an5}They hate you.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.452
{\an1}For what?!

20:20.519 --> 20:21.954
They knew you
kissed Derrick...

20:22.020 --> 20:23.755
{\an1}Whoo!
Whoop-dee-(bleep)-doo!

20:23.822 --> 20:26.091
{\an1}I kissed someone who were both
(bleep) single at the time!

20:26.158 --> 20:27.793
{\an1}It doesn't
(bleep) matter!

20:27.859 --> 20:29.361
{\an5}So you just get around...

20:27.859 --> 20:29.361
{\an1}I didn't steal
anybody's (bleep) man.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.431
{\an1}Look who's (bleep) talking!
Look who gets around?

20:32.497 --> 20:35.867
Cory can kiss my ass.
I'm going to stay here

20:35.934 --> 20:36.969
and make him miserable.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.537
{\an8}Don't (bleep) with me.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.048
(announcer)
Alicia's arrival in the house

20:50.115 --> 20:52.684
became Cory and Taylor's
worst nightmare.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.320
But then Angela became
Alicia's worst nightmare

20:55.387 --> 20:57.255
because of their past beef.

20:57.322 --> 21:02.260
{\an5}And it looks like Tor'i
might've had enough of Angela,
the pop-off queen.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.367
{\an1}And I don't know
if that...

21:10.736 --> 21:13.872
{\an5}(Tor'i)
To see Angela stressed with the
Derrick and Alicia situation,

21:13.939 --> 21:15.507
it's causing me stress.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.809
{\an8}This (bleep) is getting
old real quick.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.921
I understand completely.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.497
{\an5}(Faith)
I wanna do what I wanna do.
If I wanna talk to Tor'i,

21:38.563 --> 21:40.098
I'ma talk to Tor'i.

21:40.165 --> 21:43.669
{\an8}All right, let's not forget,
like, I am military trained.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.505
I shoot weapons.
I've thrown grenades.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.707
I'm not afraid of nobody
in this (bleep) house.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.476
{\an5}I love you so much.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.476
Anytime, I'm here.

21:51.543 --> 21:54.212
(announcer)
Oh, sounds like risky business.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.214
Speaking of risky business,

21:56.281 --> 21:59.885
it's time for a risky
business party.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.889
(beatboxing)

22:07.426 --> 22:08.827
I feel like I'm
ready to party.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.263
A'ight, I got mine.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.365
You the swag kid
since you been here.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.667
You wanna see something cool?

22:15.734 --> 22:17.402
Brrr!

22:17.469 --> 22:19.137
Ay! Everybody!

22:19.204 --> 22:20.739
I need us all
to get together!

22:20.806 --> 22:23.842
We've all had a rough day.
He's had his ex come.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.044
My ex came today,
it's been rough

22:26.111 --> 22:28.680
but we're all gonna start
this off on good vibes.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.882
{\an5}(cheering)

22:28.747 --> 22:30.882
Let's enjoy ourselves.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.484
Let's get this joint lit!

22:32.551 --> 22:36.822
(music and chatter
throughout)

22:41.426 --> 22:42.928
{\an3}(laughing)

22:44.863 --> 22:47.666
Would you be so kind to
get me a glass of wine?

22:47.733 --> 22:49.167
Sure.

22:49.234 --> 22:53.171
{\an8}I think Skyler might have
enjoyed one too many beverages.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.574
{\an5}And that's annoying to me.
I don't wanna babysit
this girl tonight.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.641
{\an1}(woman)
Who wants a shot?!

22:56.708 --> 22:59.411
Oh...
(trilling tongue)

22:59.478 --> 23:01.079
(announcer)
Skyler, I think you meant...

23:01.146 --> 23:02.414
{\an8}(trills tongue)
Okay.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.449
So with you, babe,
like, honestly, like...

23:04.516 --> 23:06.318
What's my name?

23:06.384 --> 23:09.287
Baby, my love...

23:09.354 --> 23:11.923
{\an5}It's Haley,
I (bleep) know.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.923
Okay, thank you.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.924
Get real with me.

23:12.991 --> 23:14.626
I know, I know it is.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.728
{\an5}(Chris)
The more I hang out with Haley,
I'm starting to remember.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.530
She's dope.
I love her to death.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.198
{\an8}When there's no drama,
it's Gucci.

23:20.265 --> 23:23.468
When Chelsey came in, everyone
was, like, (bleep) that bitch.

23:23.535 --> 23:24.836
She's two-face,
she's a liar.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.438
Blah-blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.807
She keeps (bleep) barking
up the wrong tree.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.175
Uh-huh.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.910
If I have to exes in here
and I want Chelsey out--

23:31.977 --> 23:34.279
{\an8}Chelsko, Chelsey,
Chelsko (bleep).

23:34.346 --> 23:36.047
{\an8}I want Chelsko out.
(chuckling).

23:36.114 --> 23:39.117
She needs to know that
her time's coming.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.254
And with you, your time's
not coming anytime soon.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.925
{\an8}I see, Chris is, like, hanging
out with Haley and it hurts.

23:46.992 --> 23:50.428
I want him to be
spending time with me.

23:50.495 --> 23:55.433
(all cheering)

23:55.500 --> 23:57.202
{\an5}(Lexi)
We're drinking,
we're having fun.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.470
Paulie looks hot as (bleep).

23:58.537 --> 24:00.806
{\an8}And I just couldn't
stop looking.

24:00.872 --> 24:04.042
(Chris)
Paulie's going crazy!

24:04.109 --> 24:08.046
(laughing and cheering)

24:11.817 --> 24:13.985
{\an5}(Faith)
Cory, Taylor and Alicia
are in a triangle.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.855
{\an8}It's an evil triangle.
It's a Bermuda Triangle.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.590
Somebody might get lost
and never come back.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.697
Ay! Ay! Ay!

24:25.764 --> 24:27.098
Chill!

24:28.834 --> 24:31.603
Why did you do that?
Huh?

24:31.670 --> 24:33.371
I told you if you
wanna stay here

24:33.438 --> 24:35.674
then that's, like, what it is.

24:35.740 --> 24:39.511
Why don't
you like me?

24:39.578 --> 24:41.146
It's just not there.
It's just not there.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.480
(bleep) that.

24:42.547 --> 24:44.616
You don't need to be
touching him like that.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.651
We were
talking, relax.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.486
{\an8}This isn't the time.
Don't do it in front of Taylor.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.555
She's not gonna
be cool with that.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.525
I cannot do this,
I cannot, I cannot.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.895
Bye ! Bitch, bye!
Bye! Bye, bitch!

25:01.900 --> 25:04.836
I can't take
this anymore.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.038
Now we can party!
Ready! Go! Ay!

25:07.105 --> 25:08.440
(laughing)

25:08.506 --> 25:12.043
{\an8}I know, I know,
I know, I know.

25:08.506 --> 25:12.043
{\an5}(crying)

25:12.110 --> 25:13.578
{\an8}I know, know.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.614
She ran upstairs,
she's crying now.

25:17.315 --> 25:18.683
{\an8}I'm having fun.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.420
(sobbing)
I'm so tired, Derrick!

25:22.487 --> 25:24.322
All I do is be myself!

25:24.389 --> 25:26.124
And nobody appreciates me.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.859
(Derrick)
I'm great friends with Taylor.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.895
And I'm good friends
with Alicia but I'm not trying

25:29.961 --> 25:32.564
{\an8}to pick sides
so, damn, this sucks.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.966
{\an1}Everybody has talked
(bleep) about me!

25:35.033 --> 25:36.902
{\an1}And then to be thrown
into a situation

25:36.968 --> 25:39.504
{\an1}where this mother(bleep)
is backtracking

25:39.571 --> 25:41.506
on some dumb ass bitch!

25:41.573 --> 25:45.143
You can't make Cory
feel some type of way.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.914
{\an5}You did everything
you should do
to make him love you.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.349
And he-- and he
didn't appreciate it.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.419
He didn't love.
That's on him.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.289
I know, I know it sucks.
I know it sucks.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.592
{\an1}I'm not gonna put some--
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.794
{\an8}I don't even know what to do,
I'm... honestly

26:02.861 --> 26:05.463
{\an8}just so confused
and really upset.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.637
{\an5}(announcer)
Uh-oh, it looks like Alicia's
going in for round two.

26:12.704 --> 26:14.172
Yeah, we gotta talk
for five seconds.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.412
Taylor, Taylor...
Taylor...

26:20.478 --> 26:21.613
I told you.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.114
Did I not tell you?

26:23.181 --> 26:25.050
I'm not doing this (bleep)
to rub it in your face.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.953
{\an5}I'm trying to be as
respectful as possible.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.953
I know.

26:28.019 --> 26:30.088
{\an8}She's here for me.
She wants me back.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.756
{\an8}And she's gonna do
whatever it takes.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.925
{\an4}(sobbing)
Oh, but Cory, like,
you don't understand!

26:33.992 --> 26:37.095
{\an5}Alicia, I can't,
I can't, I can't.

26:33.992 --> 26:37.095
Cory...

26:37.162 --> 26:39.397
{\an5}Don't (bleep) touch him.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.397
It's closure,
it's closure.

26:39.464 --> 26:43.234
{\an5}He's not gonna take you
(bleep) back!

26:39.464 --> 26:43.234
It's closure, it's closure.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.769
I have so much
love for you.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.605
That's your man!
That's your man!

26:47.672 --> 26:49.307
{\an5}(Angela)
Alicia doesn't
really want closure.

26:49.374 --> 26:50.675
She just wants her ex back.

26:50.742 --> 26:54.145
So, Alicia is priority
in the next elimination.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.413
{\an8}She's gotta go.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.949
{\an1}What about me isn't that--
doesn't do it for you?

26:58.016 --> 27:00.785
Go! Yeah, I'm telling you,
go outside!

27:00.852 --> 27:03.955
That's your man,
that's your (bleep).

27:04.022 --> 27:05.924
That's your man!
That's your man!

27:05.991 --> 27:10.261
Bitch! You don't need to be
that (bleep) close, bitch!

27:10.328 --> 27:13.064
I'm gonna punch her
in the (bleep) face.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.772
{\an1}Why-- Why is she that close?
Why are you so close?

27:20.839 --> 27:23.541
That's your man!
That's your man!

27:23.608 --> 27:24.976
{\an8}Here comes Taylor and Angela

27:25.043 --> 27:27.112
{\an8}and they're just
muh-muh-muh-muh-muh...

27:27.178 --> 27:28.380
{\an5}That's your man!

27:27.178 --> 27:28.380
{\an1}Cory!

27:28.446 --> 27:29.881
Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh...

27:29.948 --> 27:31.783
I'm, like, are y'all gonna stop?
Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh...

27:31.850 --> 27:33.385
{\an1}We're just talking.
We're talking.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.886
But you're not just talking.
You're (bleep) touching him.

27:34.953 --> 27:36.221
If you respected
the relationship,

27:36.287 --> 27:38.757
{\an1}you wouldn't be touching him,
grabbing his hand.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.526
Just relax, like, we have
other (bleep) going on.

27:41.593 --> 27:42.894
{\an8}I'm trying to get
answers out of Cory.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.497
I need to know, like, why her?
What about her?

27:45.563 --> 27:47.565
{\an8}I mean... Taylor's looking

27:47.632 --> 27:48.933
{\an8}pretty (bleep) slutty,
let's be real.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.004
And she has resting
nasty bitch face.

27:53.071 --> 27:56.541
My God, okay,
goodbye, goodbye.

27:58.743 --> 28:01.446
(muffled, with food)
Let's go outside.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.248
{\an3}What?

28:03.314 --> 28:05.617
Oh...

28:07.919 --> 28:12.424
What the (bleep)
are you saying?

28:12.490 --> 28:14.192
{\an8}Honestly, Chase, I know damn
well that you made the biggest

28:14.259 --> 28:17.462
{\an8}mistake when you decided
to choose Skyler over me.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.832
Skyler,
you are hammered.

28:20.899 --> 28:23.501
I'm not
that hammered.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.537
{\an5}(Chase)
You know, a lot of Skyler's
and our relationship

28:25.603 --> 28:28.239
has been troubled
by her partying.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.642
And there's a lot of that
going on in this house.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.143
{\an8}At this stage of my life,
I'm looking for someone

28:32.210 --> 28:34.145
{\an8}to settle down with,
someone that has a direction,

28:34.212 --> 28:36.347
{\an8}that's driven,
that's going places.

28:36.414 --> 28:40.351
And I'm just not sure Skyler's
on that level right now.

28:40.418 --> 28:43.188
{\an5}(announcer)
The couples in the house seem
to be causing a lot of drama.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.356
Maybe it's time to give
a new couple a shot.

Chris is giving me
no attention.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.348
And now I'm upset
'cause I thought

29:10.415 --> 29:11.616
{\an8}we were at a good place.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.751
{\an8}We were chillin'

29:13.818 --> 29:15.320

29:25.663 --> 29:28.166
A message in the bottle!

29:28.233 --> 29:29.167
We about to learn.

You said you
about to learn.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.338
Who wants to read it?

29:33.404 --> 29:34.839
{\an5}All right, let's see?

29:33.404 --> 29:34.839
{\an1}Are you ready

29:34.906 --> 29:36.908
{\an6}I'm ready.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.908
{\an1}All right.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.776
"Get ready,
I'm gonna shake things up.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.578
"It's time
we gave someone else

29:40.645 --> 29:43.948
"a shot at romance.

29:44.015 --> 29:46.718
"Faith and Tor'i,
head on out past the hillside

29:46.784 --> 29:49.120

a little privacy."

29:49.187 --> 29:51.089
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

29:51.156 --> 29:54.926
I don't want my man to be on
a date with anyone but me.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.128
I guess anything
can happen in this house.

29:57.195 --> 29:59.330
Okay, that's fine.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.169
{\an5}"And one more thing."

30:02.600 --> 30:04.169
{\an3}Oh, God.

30:04.235 --> 30:08.907
"Today, you will be voting to
eliminate an ex from the house."

30:08.973 --> 30:10.441
{\an5}(Chelsko)
Tonight, there is an
elimination.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.610
And I'm definitely anxious.

30:12.677 --> 30:16.948
{\an8}Chris might have to choose
between Haley and I to stay.

30:17.015 --> 30:20.351
So, I hope I'm not the one
going home tonight.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.921
{\an5}I'm about to jump
off that cliff.
Can I do that?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.895
{\an5}You ready for this?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.895
Yeah, it'll be fun.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.064
{\an5}You're excited?

30:30.962 --> 30:33.064
We get to hang out.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.832
{\an5}(Faith)
Is that a bottle?

30:33.131 --> 30:34.832
It is.

30:34.899 --> 30:37.435
(Faith)
Oh, my gosh.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.737
{\an1}I have a lot of love and
respect for you as a person.

30:39.804 --> 30:43.208
So when I see you,
I smile, walk into a room,

30:43.274 --> 30:45.143
{\an5}I smile because
you're dope.

30:43.274 --> 30:45.143
{\an1}(laughs)

30:45.210 --> 30:46.778
You're-- like,
you really are.

30:46.844 --> 30:49.080
I'm here to see who will
be the right fit for me.

30:49.147 --> 30:51.015
And I think time
will tell with that.

30:51.082 --> 30:52.717
{\an1}Do you feel like
you're exploring that?

30:52.784 --> 30:55.153
{\an1}Like, I feel like
you're really tied down.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.389
Angela is someone that
I like, her personality.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.625
But I'm not looking for
someone to constantly

31:00.692 --> 31:02.160
be pulling my
energy from me.

31:02.227 --> 31:05.630
It shouldn't be that tough
in the beginning... period.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.600
{\an8}Angela has given a lot of her
energy to the Alicia situation.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.436
And I feel like I'm constantly
being dragged down.

31:11.502 --> 31:12.737
I don't need that.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.506
{\an5}Okay, I'm gonna
try some things.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.506
{\an3}Okay.

31:15.573 --> 31:16.808
{\an1}So, let's do--
let's go with yellow

31:16.874 --> 31:18.142
{\an5}'cause yellow's
a pretty color.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.142
{\an3}Okay.

31:27.151 --> 31:28.052
(shrieks)

31:28.119 --> 31:29.654
{\an1}I'm not doing it.
Turn around.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.689
{\an3}Butt shot.

31:31.756 --> 31:34.392
Oh, my God...

A'ight, Tor'i, what did
you do today, though?

{\an8}Body shots,

32:17.802 --> 32:20.605
(Faith)
It was great.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.608
{\an8}Oh, my God, if Angela
hears about the date,
it will be a mess.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.576
I had a blast.
I had a blast.

32:25.643 --> 32:29.013
When she hears about the details
and the skin and the touching

32:29.080 --> 32:31.449
{\an8}and the licking
and the sucking...

32:31.516 --> 32:33.084
{\an8}She gonna be mad as (bleep).

32:34.585 --> 32:35.953
I wanna know
about this date.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.089
{\an5}It was real,
we had fun.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.089
{\an3}Yeah, yeah.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.590
{\an4}She's a great person,
a great friend.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.590
{\an3}Yeah.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.093
{\an1}And throughout this process,
if things don't work out here,

32:42.160 --> 32:43.261
{\an1}it could be
something there.

32:43.328 --> 32:44.595
{\an1}And that date, like,
things was hot.

32:44.662 --> 32:45.997
We did body shots.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.801
{\an4}Yeah, she do, she do.
Yeah, yeah.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.801
She told you?

32:49.867 --> 32:52.370
{\an1}So where's your head at you,
you think you gonna...

32:55.540 --> 32:57.575
{\an5}Yeah, she's gotta go.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.575
I'm with you, bro.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.210
Personally, like, you know,

32:59.277 --> 33:03.081
{\an1}I think Cory wants Alicia
out of here because...

33:03.147 --> 33:05.083
{\an5}Uncomfortable for him.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.083
Well, I mean...

33:05.149 --> 33:06.851
{\an1}I think it's just uncomfortable
for the both of them.

33:06.918 --> 33:07.952
You know what I mean?

33:08.019 --> 33:09.454
{\an1}That's how he feels
about Chelsey.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.896
{\an8}Of course, on Cory's side,
there's people voting

33:18.963 --> 33:20.198
{\an8}Alicia out.

33:20.264 --> 33:21.866
But I have to exes in here.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.335
And I want Chels to get
the (bleep) out.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.710
I think that's fair.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.812
{\an8}What my plan is, I'm gonna put
my heart in for Alicia.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.247
{\an8}Because I feel like...

33:36.314 --> 33:39.784
not too many people
are gonna X Chelsey out.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.320
You know, they're not gonna--
there's not enough cuts for her.

33:42.387 --> 33:43.821
{\an5}(Tor'i)
I'm just curious,
like, I wanna see

33:43.888 --> 33:45.990
where your head is at.
Where your vote's going.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.929
I'm totally cool.
I'll be right back.

33:51.996 --> 33:55.233
{\an5}(Chris)
You know, I lied to Tor'i 'cause
I'm engineering this whole

33:55.299 --> 33:57.268
mother(bleep)
chessboard because I can't

33:57.335 --> 33:58.903
focus on Haley
if Chelsko's here.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.105
{\an5}(announcer)
Careful, Chris,
secrets and lies

34:01.172 --> 34:03.274
don't stay secret for long
in the villa.

34:03.341 --> 34:04.976
{\an5}So, it's us
four, right?

34:03.341 --> 34:04.976
Yup, guaranteed.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.644
Us four, guaranteed.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.513
{\an5}(announcer)
I know what you're all thinking.
Wait, what?

34:08.579 --> 34:10.148
Let's break it down.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.152
Right now, Chris has Jasmine and
Paulie voting to cut Chelsko.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.588
And Cory has Angela, Taylor,
Victoria and Tor'i

34:17.655 --> 34:19.157
voting to cut Alicia.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.627
That's five cut votes for Alicia
and two for Chelsko.

34:22.693 --> 34:25.763
But, with Chris's
crush vote for Alicia,

34:25.830 --> 34:27.565
it brings her to four cuts.

34:27.632 --> 34:30.201
With Chase and Faith's vote
up in the air

34:30.268 --> 34:32.370
anything could happen.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.216
(Cory)
I want Alicia to go home.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.217
If I can get my ex out
of the house tonight..

34:47.284 --> 34:49.719
I got Taylor's ex out of the
house the first night.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.590
{\an8}I'm good! We won, we won.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.069
(Angela)
Bye, Alicia.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.804
I'm gonna use this crush
to cancel out

35:06.871 --> 35:09.941
one of Alicia's cuts to try
to give me a better chance

35:10.007 --> 35:11.609
to get Chelsey
out of this house.

35:13.911 --> 35:17.014
{\an5}(Faith)
Tonight, I'm cutting Chelsko
because everyone has a issue

35:17.081 --> 35:18.783
with Alicia, and I totally
get what she's done

35:18.850 --> 35:21.185
to Taylor, Cory and Angela.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.520
But Chris has a voice, too.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.388
Somebody has to be there
for Chris, as well.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.891
And I will be the person
that's there for Chris.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.125
Gucci Gang.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.931
{\an5}(announcer)
Now that Faith
has chosen a side,

35:33.998 --> 35:38.469
it's four cuts for Alicia
and three cuts for Chelsko.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.704
Saw you, girl.

35:39.770 --> 35:43.107
Did you stick to
what we talked about?

35:43.174 --> 35:45.943
{\an7}I'm down because, you know,
how much I want her out.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.212
So, we're a solid four.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.715
{\an1}I know.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.750
I got pulled
to the side.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.018
Oh, wait, I'm confused.

35:58.723 --> 35:59.957
He has two people here.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.460
And Chris is our friend.
He is our friend.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.195
We would expect him
to have our back.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.663
That's all I'm saying.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.299
{\an8}I think everybody's scheming
on the low tonight.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.168
But I think that Chris kind
of gave Tor'i reassurance

36:11.235 --> 36:13.070
that he would vote for Alicia.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.840
The house is
so divided right now

36:15.907 --> 36:17.875
that it could go either way.

36:17.942 --> 36:20.244
{\an5}Did you speak
with Faith?

36:17.942 --> 36:20.244
Yes.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.381
{\an1}She was, like, I'm sorry, she
was, like, this kid, Chris just

36:23.447 --> 36:25.449
came to me begging, pleading
that he wants this girl out.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.418
{\an1}He's, like,
my two exes are here.

36:27.485 --> 36:30.054
{\an4}He's, like, something's
gotta give, someone's
gotta help me out.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.056
{\an5}(Angela)
The votes are changing
and they're not going my way.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.424
All of you have
targets on your back.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.526
We are the OGs.
We've been here since day one.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.595
We should be
working together.

36:37.662 --> 36:40.331
{\an8}But little Chris is trying to
politic his vote.

36:40.398 --> 36:41.732
You're playing
with the big boys now, baby.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.001
Please take a seat.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.736
If she stays...

36:45.803 --> 36:48.573
{\an5}there's gonna be
issues all around,
I'm telling you right now.

36:48.639 --> 36:51.175
{\an5}(announcer)
Looks like Chris's lies
have caught up with him.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.843
That didn't take long.

36:52.910 --> 36:57.415
Now it's down to Chase's vote
which could change everything.

36:57.481 --> 37:00.084
Ooh... really kind of sweating
this vote tonight.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.153
(inhales/exhales)

37:02.219 --> 37:04.522
I think, you know, I want
everyone to kind of have

37:04.589 --> 37:06.924
a fair chance out here
on "Ex On The Beach."

37:06.991 --> 37:10.728
So, I wanna show that there is
some positivity in this house.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.363
(announcer)
Wait, but who did Chase crush?

37:12.430 --> 37:14.298
The suspense is killing me.

37:21.439 --> 37:25.209
{\an8}The tension is so high walking
into elimination tonight.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.822
{\an5}(Alicia)
It is gonna suck if I do leave
because it's kind of like

37:37.888 --> 37:40.491
{\an8}unfinished business.
I look like a crying idiot

37:40.558 --> 37:43.494
over someone who does
not appreciate me.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.200
{\an8}Y'all don't look
too happy over there, man.

37:49.266 --> 37:50.801
(woman laughs)

37:56.073 --> 37:58.676
Who don't feel good?

37:58.743 --> 38:00.645
{\an5}(Victoria)
Am I allowed to speak
my piece yet?

38:00.711 --> 38:01.879
{\an5}(Romeo)
You wanna say
something right quick?

38:01.946 --> 38:03.280
I do, I need to call Chris out.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.149
{\an5}(Angela)
Thank you Thank you.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.149
I, I, I do.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.517
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.753
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure,
I'm sure, I'm sure.

38:08.819 --> 38:11.322
{\an5}You'd vote for Chelsko
if it wasn't for them.

38:08.819 --> 38:11.322
{\an3}Sit down!

38:11.389 --> 38:13.824
Sit the (bleep) down!
You (bleep) fraud.

38:13.891 --> 38:17.228
{\an8}Okay, Victoria, I think
Angela's, like, the ringleader
on this one, you know?

38:17.294 --> 38:19.263
She wants Alicia.
out of this house.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.332
And, like, if she doesn't
like somebody

38:21.399 --> 38:23.034
then no one
can like them either.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.369
{\an5}Don't look somebody
in the eye and give
them your word

38:25.436 --> 38:26.437
{\an5}and go back on it!

38:25.436 --> 38:26.437
{\an1}Thank you.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.938
{\an1}Don't be (bleep)
Don't be fake.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.874
Did you ask me?!
Did you ask me?!

38:29.940 --> 38:31.008
You didn't ask me!

38:31.075 --> 38:32.810
{\an5}Don't be fake.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.810
'Cause I got feelings.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.845
{\an5}(Chris)
I don't feel like they're taking
my feelings under consideration.

38:34.912 --> 38:36.747
{\an8}I have two exes in the house.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.750
{\an5}At this point, I feel
like my future with Haley
could be amazing.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.253
But I can't focus
on Haley if she's here.

38:42.319 --> 38:45.623
So, I see there's a lot of
tension in the house.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.324
Could we get
this thing going?

38:47.391 --> 38:49.193
{\an4}(woman)
Let's do it!

38:47.391 --> 38:49.193
Derrick, how you feeling?

38:49.260 --> 38:51.629
You still feel like you
in the hot seat tonight?

38:51.696 --> 38:53.164
I know there's teams being
formed but...

38:53.230 --> 38:55.066
That's, that's life,
though, in general.

38:55.132 --> 38:57.768
{\an5}Yeah, exactly, it's not...

38:55.132 --> 38:57.768
It's like we don't live
in a perfect world.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.604
{\an5}Lines have been drawn,
thank you,
lines have been drawn.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.007
{\an5}(Chris)
It's not about alliances, bro,
like what the (bleep)...

39:03.074 --> 39:05.409
(bleep) piece of (bleep),
I'm coming for you!

39:05.476 --> 39:07.111
I don't know who you--
Who are you talking about?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.779
Do it! Do it!
You don't know me yet!

39:08.846 --> 39:10.581
But you will know me!
Know that!

39:14.952 --> 39:15.886
Don't be fake,
Don't be fake.

39:15.953 --> 39:17.822
'Cause I got feelings.

39:17.888 --> 39:21.392
{\an5}Don't look me in the eyes
and lie to my (bleep)
face next time then.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.195
{\an5}Oh, my God.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.195
Oh, come on.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.063
A dead ass don't.
Don't do it.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.164
Be (bleep) loyal.

39:27.231 --> 39:28.432
If you wanna (bleep)
do something,

39:28.499 --> 39:29.433
let me know to
my (bleep) face.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.168
I'm not doing nothing.

39:31.235 --> 39:32.903
{\an5}(Faith)
I ain't gotta let nobody know
(bleep) what y'all do.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.338
You're like some bullies.
You're like some bullies.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.607
{\an5}You're like some bullies.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.607
Bullies?

39:36.674 --> 39:38.409
That's not
bullying (bleep).

39:38.476 --> 39:41.445
{\an4}It is bullying.
Yes, it is.

39:38.476 --> 39:41.445
No, it's not!

39:41.512 --> 39:42.980
{\an8}I came out of Annie Louise
Stowers (bleep).

39:43.047 --> 39:44.515
{\an8}That is my mother.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.218
{\an8}That's the only person
I owe (bleep) to, okay, okay?

39:47.284 --> 39:48.886
And she ain't on this
mother(bleep).

39:48.953 --> 39:51.021
Just don't (bleep) lie!

39:51.088 --> 39:53.224
I can do what I wanna do!

39:53.290 --> 39:55.326
(loud, angry crosstalk)

39:55.392 --> 39:56.660
Did you not tell
him something different?!

39:56.727 --> 39:59.663
It doesn't matter what
the (bleep) I say!

39:59.730 --> 40:01.098
{\an8}I don't care what
Faith is going through.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.433
{\an8}Don't come for my girl.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.635
{\an8}I'm gonna have her back
and I got you, boo.

40:04.702 --> 40:07.571
{\an5}Tell Angela how
you feel about Tor'i!
You ought to be real!

40:07.638 --> 40:09.807
{\an5}I told Angela.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.807
You be real!

40:11.675 --> 40:13.677
{\an5}What about today?

40:11.675 --> 40:13.677
What did you do today, though?

40:13.744 --> 40:16.113
{\an8}Body shots,
but I'm here.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.882
{\an1}Body shots,
but I'm here.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.383
{\an3}Body shots?

40:20.985 --> 40:25.122
{\an8}(sobbing)
This is all... like,
too much for me to take.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.825
You think that people have
your back and they don't.

40:27.892 --> 40:31.162
And, like, the person closest to
you just doesn't have your back.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.630
You hurt him
at the end of the day!

40:32.696 --> 40:35.599
Bro code is over!
He's calling you out right now!

40:37.034 --> 40:39.837
{\an8}I don't think we were supposed
to find out about that.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.606
{\an5}You (bleep) it up, that's you!

40:39.904 --> 40:42.606
Baby...

40:42.673 --> 40:45.976
Nobody (bleep) touch me!
Don't touch me!

40:46.043 --> 40:47.178
Don't touch me.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.613
Ooh, yeah, I swear!
I swear!

40:49.680 --> 40:51.749
Oh, everything,
don't say (bleep) to me!

40:51.816 --> 40:55.419
{\an8}I felt like I was stabbed in the
back by a couple of my homies.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.988
{\an5}I spoke what I knew.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.988
Don't say (bleep) to nobody!

40:58.055 --> 41:01.425
Come up at me tough,
I swear... oh, everything!

41:01.492 --> 41:04.228
Oh, everything!
Don't say (bleep)!

41:04.295 --> 41:06.263
Tor'i, don't go!

41:06.330 --> 41:09.133
I said I'm done!
I'm done!

41:09.200 --> 41:12.670
I said I'm done!
Let me go (bleep) home!

41:15.506 --> 41:19.810
{\an8}(announcer)
Next time on
"Ex On The Beach."

41:19.877 --> 41:21.846
As a dramatic elimination
continues...

41:21.912 --> 41:24.014
I did nothing to
nobody in this house.

41:24.081 --> 41:27.618
{\an5}Listen, you know Angela's
gonna feel how she feels
about the situation.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.887
If you were a real man, you
would've came and told Angela...

41:29.954 --> 41:33.057
{\an5}(announcer)
Will the pressure push Angela
into the arms of her ex?

41:33.123 --> 41:34.625
What the (bleep)?!

41:34.692 --> 41:36.827
{\an5}(announcer)
And has Chris pushed
Haley too far?
