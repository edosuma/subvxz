00:31.801 --> 00:34.200
Well, are you gonna
tell him or not?

00:34.267 --> 00:37.667
If you think you can live
With this on your conscience.

00:37.734 --> 00:39.934
That's not how it works, sweetie.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.200
Yeah, you can put it
out of your head.

00:42.267 --> 00:43.667
It'll just go to your heart.

00:43.734 --> 00:44.701
[car alarm chirps]

00:44.767 --> 00:46.701
Well, then it'll go
Somewhere else.

I don't know.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.200
Your liver, your pancreas.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.234
Why do you think
So many people get cancer?

00:53.300 --> 00:56.067
That's how it works.
That's what guilt does.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.033
It makes people sick.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.634
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do.

01:05.701 --> 01:07.334
Well, I'm sorry that
it came off that way,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.167
But you can understand
my position.

01:09.234 --> 01:10.801
I'm friends with both of you.

01:10.868 --> 01:14.267
No, of course I'm not
gonna tell him, janet.

01:14.334 --> 01:16.501
I love you, but I'm sorry,

01:16.567 --> 01:19.667

does not justify--

01:19.734 --> 01:21.300

01:21.367 --> 01:23.667
Hey, I'm coming to
a bad spot on 7.

01:23.734 --> 01:25.367
I might lose you.

01:25.434 --> 01:26.667
Hello?

01:26.734 --> 01:27.968

Never.

03:38.601 --> 03:41.067
Look at you.
Did somebody die?

03:41.133 --> 03:42.567
Oh. No.

03:42.634 --> 03:44.734
B.a.u. Yearbook photo?

03:44.801 --> 03:46.701
No, I have a job interview.

03:46.767 --> 03:49.901
Hey, rock star, you up
For that systems promotion?

03:49.968 --> 03:53.033
No, no. A friend of mine
Is a headhunter for the nsa.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.267
Uh, they're looking
For analysts versed
In cyber warfare.

03:56.334 --> 03:57.701
Really? That sounds exciting.

03:57.767 --> 04:00.734
Oh, it is. Yeah, the job
Is totally cutting edge.

04:00.801 --> 04:01.968
Yeah, it sounds like it.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.634
Are you sure you're gonna
Want to make the commute

04:03.701 --> 04:05.801
To fort mead every day?

04:05.868 --> 04:07.367
Uh--ahem--

04:07.434 --> 04:10.634
Actually, it's a--
It's an overseas position.

04:11.901 --> 04:13.334
Where overseas?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.901
I can't say.
It's classified.

04:17.901 --> 04:19.834
Are we breaking up
Right now?

04:19.901 --> 04:22.100
Uh, no. No.
Uh--uh--they haven't
Hired me yet.

04:22.167 --> 04:23.934
It--it's my final
Interview.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.834
Final?

04:25.901 --> 04:27.834
How long have you known
About this?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.234
Uh...a few weeks.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.033
I didn't want to say
Anything to you
Until it was real.

04:33.434 --> 04:36.334
Ok. Ok.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.834
And...

04:37.901 --> 04:39.434
And this is what you want?

04:41.767 --> 04:44.033
I'm not sure.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.467
I mean, the long-distance
Thing would be rough.

04:46.534 --> 04:50.234
Yeah, it would be,
Considering you can't even
Tell me where you're going.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.901
Well, i--i could if
You applied with me.

04:52.968 --> 04:55.334
I mean,
They need other people.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.467
Leave the b.a.u.?

04:58.534 --> 04:59.934
Just think about it?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.567
Um...

05:03.634 --> 05:06.400
My head hurts, and jj
Just brought in a case.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.901
I need to get back
To work.

05:08.968 --> 05:10.067
Oh.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.901
[typing]

05:14.667 --> 05:16.467
An unsub that kills
With his car.

05:16.534 --> 05:18.100
I haven't seen that before.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.767
Neither have the police
In bend, oregon.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.434
Which is why
They need our help.

05:21.501 --> 05:23.634
Two victims
In the last 12 days.

05:23.701 --> 05:25.200
First was hit while
On a morning jog--

05:25.267 --> 05:26.634
Maria delgado, 23.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.601
The second was a stranded
Motorist, shannon makely, 43.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.300
And what makes
The locals think
That they were connected?

05:32.367 --> 05:33.534
Well, for one thing,

05:33.601 --> 05:36.000
They were both backed over
After the initial impact.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.100
No accident there.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.934
They matched treads
At both scenes.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.367
Large wheels, all-terrain.

05:40.434 --> 05:41.934
Wounds also indicate
A raised bumper,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.300
So they're thinking
Large suv or truck.

05:44.367 --> 05:45.767
Do they know
The model or make?

05:45.834 --> 05:47.067
Uh, tires aren't factory issue.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.667
They could be on a number
Of different models.

05:49.734 --> 05:50.934
No witnesses
To either incident?

05:51.033 --> 05:51.968
Jj: mm-mmm.

05:52.033 --> 05:54.100
A hit-and-run is loud,
Draws attention.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.133
Somebody usually
Sees something.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.100
Both victims were attacked
In secluded areas.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.367
2 tons of metal
Make a hell of a weapon.

06:00.434 --> 06:02.901
Serial killers have been known
To become rather attached
To their vehicles.

06:02.968 --> 06:04.567
Bittaker and norris
Even have theirs a nickname.

06:04.634 --> 06:05.567
Murder mac.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.234
Bittaker and norris
Were sexual sadists.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.667
There's no sign
Of torture here.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.334
It sounds like thrill kills.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.734
Opportunistic.

06:11.801 --> 06:14.567
Easy targets
Randomly selected.

06:14.634 --> 06:16.400
With this type of impact,

06:16.467 --> 06:18.067
The vehicle shouldn't be hard
To pick out of a lineup.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.534
Yeah, there should be
Significant front-end
Damage.

06:20.601 --> 06:23.234
Somehow I don't think
It's gonna be that easy.

06:38.901 --> 06:41.367
[engine starts]

07:22.601 --> 07:24.968
Hotch: "I'm not sure
About automobiles.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.033
"with all their speed forward,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.868
They may be a step backward
In civilization."

07:29.934 --> 07:31.701
Booth tarkington.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.801
Well, I think it's safe
To assume our unsub is male.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.901
I agree with you,
Given what we know

07:39.968 --> 07:41.300
About aggressive driving
And road rage.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.667
And the fact that men

07:43.734 --> 07:45.334
Have an unnatural bond
With their cars.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.534
That is true.

07:46.601 --> 07:47.934
Wait a minute.
I don't know about unnatural.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.367
I once dated a guy

07:49.434 --> 07:51.367
Who washed his car more
Than he washed his hair.

07:51.434 --> 07:53.067
A nice car needs love.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.367
And a woman doesn't?

07:54.434 --> 07:57.100
I'm not qualified
To answer that.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.367
[laughing]

07:58.434 --> 08:01.701
I'm just saying,
Big car--it's phallic.

08:01.767 --> 08:02.968
So he's compensating?

08:03.033 --> 08:04.200
Or overcompensating.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.200
Impotent?

08:05.267 --> 08:06.667
Possibly. If the unsub
Sees himself

08:06.734 --> 08:08.133
As physically defective,

08:08.200 --> 08:09.634
The car not only gives him
The power and control

08:09.701 --> 08:12.801
He otherwise lacks, but
It also serves as a shield.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.734
A way to avoid
Physical contact?

08:14.801 --> 08:17.300
Power and control,
Female victims--

08:17.367 --> 08:19.567
That almost reads
Like a rape profile.

08:19.634 --> 08:21.067
Vehicular rape.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.100
Rape and thrill kill
Are two very different profiles.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.567
What does the victimology
Tell us?

08:24.634 --> 08:26.601
Jj: nothing yet. Shannon makely

08:26.667 --> 08:29.067
Was a white, married,
43-year-old commodities trader,

08:29.133 --> 08:32.667
Maria delgado was a 23-year-old
Hispanic grad student,

08:32.734 --> 08:34.333
Competitive tri-athlete.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.033
So far, gender's
Our only link.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.133
Hopefully the crime scenes
Will tell us more.

08:40.433 --> 08:41.567
Aah!

08:41.634 --> 08:42.833
[impact]

08:45.634 --> 08:47.701
She lived a little
Outside of town,

08:47.767 --> 08:50.968
Was on her way home from work
When she broke down.

08:51.033 --> 08:52.200
So she breaks down
Way back there

08:52.267 --> 08:53.868
And she gets out
And starts walking.

08:53.934 --> 08:54.934
Why not call for help?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.434
No service.

08:57.501 --> 09:01.300
He made a complete stop
Here, then hit the gas.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.801
Full stop in the middle
Of the road?

09:02.868 --> 09:04.934
Take it there's not
A lot of traffic out here.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.200
Not on this stretch.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.801
Not at that time of day,
At least.

09:07.868 --> 09:09.801
Done working by 3:00
In the afternoon.

09:09.868 --> 09:12.667
Broker. Specialized
In foreign markets.

09:12.734 --> 09:15.667
Time difference made for
Some odd hours.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.501
What are you thinking
About, rossi?

09:19.567 --> 09:22.901
What are the odds
She breaks down right here?

09:22.968 --> 09:26.567
No phone, no traffic,
No witnesses, nowhere to run.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.334
Perfect place for an ambush.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.000
Not a very popular
Jogging area.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.334
Aren't too many people

09:32.400 --> 09:34.167
Who can take that hill
Coming up here.

09:34.234 --> 09:35.467
Well, she was a tri-athlete.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.467
We figured she jogged in
Off the main road,

09:38.534 --> 09:40.167
Heading for the trail up here.

09:40.234 --> 09:41.868
Assailant drove in
Behind her

09:41.934 --> 09:43.934
And ran her down
Right here.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.334
Uh...a woman
Jogging alone?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.868
No, she would have known
If someone was tailing her.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.501
So maybe he was already here.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.934
What's the story
With all this equipment?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.033
Construction stalled out
Months ago.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.701
No reason for anyone
To be up here.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.200
Nice and private.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.200
It's the ideal spot
To run somebody down

10:01.267 --> 10:02.467
Without being seen.

10:02.534 --> 10:04.167
A little convenient.

10:04.234 --> 10:05.868
Too convenient.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.534
What if it was her?

10:07.601 --> 10:09.334
What if she were the
Reason he was up here?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.300
You don't think
This was a random attack.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.601
Oil.

10:17.434 --> 10:19.234
He was lying in wait.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.634
He may have specifically
Targeted these women.

10:22.701 --> 10:24.200
That takes thrill kill
Off the table.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.834
Because the murders
Were planned in advance?

10:25.901 --> 10:27.334
Yeah. This type
Of stalking behavior

10:27.400 --> 10:29.133
Indicates a personal motive.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.667
There's a reason
He chose these victims.

10:31.734 --> 10:33.133
So you think he knows them?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.501
Well, he knew
Their work schedules,

10:34.567 --> 10:36.334
Jogging routes, drive patterns.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.200
That would explain how
He knew where to strike.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.534
It explains
The delgado girl.
She was on a run.

10:40.601 --> 10:42.067
But he couldn't have known
Shannon makely's car

10:42.133 --> 10:43.400
Was gonna break down
Out there.

10:43.467 --> 10:44.868
Did you look at her car?

10:44.934 --> 10:47.367
Guys at impound said
The water pump blew.

10:47.434 --> 10:48.901
They said it's a common
Enough problem.

10:48.968 --> 10:50.367
Maybe we should take
A closer look.

10:50.434 --> 10:53.701
Why don't you head over there,
Let me know what you find out.

10:53.767 --> 10:55.601
Shannon makely's husband
Is here.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.701
I just want it to make sense.

10:57.767 --> 11:00.200
But this, i...

11:00.267 --> 11:02.868
We may be able to make
Some sense out of it

11:02.934 --> 11:03.901
With your help.

11:03.968 --> 11:07.400
Do you recognize
That woman?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.434
No. Should i?

11:09.501 --> 11:11.200
She was the first victim.

11:11.267 --> 11:12.601
We're trying to determine

11:12.667 --> 11:15.300
If she was connected
To your wife in some way.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.467
Connected?

11:16.534 --> 11:17.968
We believe he may have
Been following them,

11:18.033 --> 11:20.701
Gathering some sort
Of information.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.868
Did shannon ever mention
Noticing anyone?

11:23.934 --> 11:25.067
No.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.100
Did you ever notice
Anyone

11:27.167 --> 11:28.901
Out of the ordinary
In your neighborhood,

11:28.968 --> 11:31.067
Maybe someone who was
Walking or driving

11:31.133 --> 11:32.601
By the house repeatedly?

11:32.667 --> 11:33.601
No.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.000
What about a truck

11:35.067 --> 11:36.734
Or a large suv?

11:41.467 --> 11:44.667
Thursday, I was
Expecting a package.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.234
I kept checking the street.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.300
There was a truck parked
A couple of houses down.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.834
I didn't recognize it.

11:49.901 --> 11:52.400
Hotch: could you see
Anyone inside?

11:52.467 --> 11:54.234
I couldn't tell.
The windows were blacked out.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.601
Tinted?

11:55.667 --> 11:56.667
Yeah,

11:56.734 --> 11:57.734
Only all the way around,

11:57.801 --> 11:59.167
Like you see with limousines.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.501
Do you think that you
Would recognize the truck

12:03.567 --> 12:04.801
If you saw it again?

12:04.868 --> 12:06.300
[sniffles, clears throat]

12:06.367 --> 12:07.801
Maybe.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.067
How's it coming, gil?

12:18.133 --> 12:19.400
[inhales sharply,
Clears throat]

12:19.467 --> 12:20.534
It's coming.

12:20.601 --> 12:22.167
These roof sections
Are brutal.

12:22.234 --> 12:25.167
Yeah. Maybe you want to take
An early day.

12:25.234 --> 12:26.701
[chuckles] don't I wish.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.868
Look, I can smell
The booze, man.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.767
I can tell bert
You went home sick.

12:35.834 --> 12:36.767
But--

12:36.834 --> 12:38.267
I can handle it.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.767
You're sliding, man.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.734
Mistakes, missed deadlines.

12:46.801 --> 12:48.801
Is everything ok?

13:10.100 --> 13:12.067
We figured it was
The water pump

13:12.133 --> 13:13.534
Because it was
Pretty much melted.

13:13.601 --> 13:15.934
But we didn't
Figure on this.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.534
Car's pretty new.
That wouldn't be normal
Wear and tear, would it?

13:23.601 --> 13:25.601
No. Rest of the line's
In good condition.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.501
Someone punctured it.
You can tell
From the smooth edge.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.501
How did they do it?

13:30.567 --> 13:32.601
Probably reached a blade
Right through the grille.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.400
Penknife.
Something like that.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.033
They wouldn't have
Even had to pop
The hood.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.234
And if she drove away
Without water
In the radiator,

13:38.300 --> 13:39.701
It explains
The overheating.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.067
It explains the pump, too.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.133
Could somebody possibly gauge
How far she could have traveled

13:43.200 --> 13:44.634
With the car
In this condition?

13:44.701 --> 13:47.767
Someone who knows cars
Could make an educated
Guess, sure.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.601
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

13:52.801 --> 13:54.067
Sabotage.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.200
He's more focused
Than we thought.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.300
Well organized,
Highly motivated.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.667
By what, though?
What do these women
Have in common?

14:00.734 --> 14:03.701
Different ages,
Appearance, social class.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.000
He's not hunting
A specific type.

14:06.067 --> 14:07.501
Their only connection
Is the unsub.

14:07.567 --> 14:10.167
There has to have been contact
Before the attacks.

14:10.234 --> 14:12.701
But we profiled a guy
Who's afraid of contact.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.033
The truck's a shield.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.567
Maybe the contact's incidental.

14:15.634 --> 14:17.901
There's something he perceives
In their exchange.

14:19.767 --> 14:23.767
Something about his perception
Triggers his fixation.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.467
Could be the way
She looks at him,
Something she says,

14:35.534 --> 14:37.501
Or even something as trivial
As what she's wearing.

14:48.467 --> 14:49.934
Whatever it is,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.100
 The victims have no idea
 What they set in motion.

15:03.734 --> 15:06.000
These are all ford models.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.501
The grilles are kind of
Like you described.

15:07.567 --> 15:10.133
Yeah, I guess.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.634
It didn't have
That emblem, though.

15:11.701 --> 15:13.934
And no hood ornament.
Nothing like that.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.267
I understand this is hard,

15:15.334 --> 15:16.567
But this really will
Help us.

15:16.634 --> 15:18.501
I'll keep looking.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.000
How's it going?

15:20.067 --> 15:22.767
Well, we're down to
An older model,
Black, american made.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.167
Sounds like he debadged
The truck so nobody
Could i.d. Him.

15:25.234 --> 15:28.267
I can start a list from dmv
Matching what we've got.

15:28.334 --> 15:30.467
A list like that's
Gonna kill a lot of trees.

15:30.534 --> 15:32.000
He's right. The truck's
Only gonna get us so far.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.834
What we need to do
Is build on the profile.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.767
Well, he's mechanically
Inclined.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.501
He certainly knows his away
Around an engine block.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.801
And he can pull a dent, too,

15:38.868 --> 15:40.167
If he's fixing the body
Damage to his truck.

15:40.234 --> 15:42.000
Both victims were killed
During prime office hours.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.501
It means he has a flexible
Work schedule.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.501
Or he might not be working
At all.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.667
Stalking someone,
Getting to know their schedule,

15:47.734 --> 15:49.601
It's a pretty serious
Time commitment.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.100
8% of the state's
Out of work.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.033
And job loss
Is a classic stressor.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.267
It's a start.
Look for men

15:54.334 --> 15:56.200
Who are employed as
Mechanics, body shops,

15:56.267 --> 15:57.968
And look for those
With criminal records--

15:58.033 --> 15:59.801
Reckless driving
And assault.

15:59.868 --> 16:02.300
Two murders in two weeks?
It's not much of
A cooling-off period.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.934
He's not gonna wait
For another opportunity
To present itself.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.300
Now he'll create one.

16:23.868 --> 16:25.367
Son of a--

16:30.067 --> 16:31.267
Great.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.367
[tires screeching]

16:33.434 --> 16:36.534
[screeching]

16:41.934 --> 16:45.167
[music playing]

16:45.234 --> 16:47.434
* I'm alive *

16:47.501 --> 16:53.000
* I'm breathing clean fresh
Air today, I'm alive *

16:53.067 --> 16:55.067
[song continues indistinct]

16:55.133 --> 16:57.934
[engine revving]

16:58.033 --> 17:02.100
* I can see and touch
And see and feel, I'm alive *

17:02.167 --> 17:03.534
[tires screeching]

17:24.233 --> 17:25.166
Help me!

17:40.934 --> 17:42.267
Hold the elevator!

17:44.100 --> 17:45.300
Hold it!

17:54.167 --> 17:56.667
Impact nearly
Cut him in two.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.434
His name is
Victor costella,

17:58.501 --> 18:00.400
Podiatrist. He works
In the building.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.167
Male victim.

18:02.234 --> 18:04.167
So much for the
Vehicular rape theory.

18:04.234 --> 18:05.801
He ran down
From the level above

18:05.868 --> 18:07.434
To try to get away.

18:07.501 --> 18:09.534
Initial collision was up there?

18:09.601 --> 18:11.367
Let's see it.

18:13.534 --> 18:14.868
This is the victim's car?

18:14.934 --> 18:15.868
Yeah. Why?

18:15.934 --> 18:17.534
Uh, excuse me
For a second.

18:17.601 --> 18:19.534
Garcia, I need you
To look into something.

18:19.601 --> 18:20.834
It's a reserved spot.

18:20.901 --> 18:22.767
Unsub knew where
He was gonna park,

18:22.834 --> 18:24.300
Must have gotten here early

18:24.367 --> 18:26.367
And picked this spot
Right across.

18:26.434 --> 18:28.200
Somebody might have
Seen him waiting.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.968
Somebody did.
Talked to an x-ray tech

18:30.033 --> 18:31.300
On the third floor.

18:31.367 --> 18:32.934
Noticed a truck
When she arrived.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.767
And he was inside it?

18:34.834 --> 18:36.133
Yeah, but she couldn't see him
Because of the tint.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.200
So how did she know
He was inside the truck?

18:38.267 --> 18:39.334
She said the window
Was cracked.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.701
Occupant was smoking.

18:40.767 --> 18:44.801
* yes, I'm alive *

18:44.868 --> 18:46.234
* I'm real... *

18:46.300 --> 18:49.567
I don't suppose your people
Found any cigarette butts.

18:51.467 --> 18:55.067
What time did the, uh,
Tech get in?

18:55.133 --> 18:56.667
10 a.m.

18:56.734 --> 18:58.534
7 hours.

18:58.601 --> 19:02.634
Proper addict
Could kill a whole pack.

19:02.701 --> 19:05.100
Did you ever smoke?

19:05.167 --> 19:07.767
I used to do a lot of things.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.267
Bet you never did this.

19:09.334 --> 19:11.701
He field-stripped it.

19:11.767 --> 19:12.968
What is that?

19:13.033 --> 19:14.634
Something
They teach soldiers

19:14.701 --> 19:16.133
To avoid leaving
Traces in the field.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.033
They squeeze out the filter,

19:18.100 --> 19:20.467
Then ball up
The surrounding paper.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.033
Ok, so our guy could be
Ex-military.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.300
We can get dna on this.

19:24.367 --> 19:25.968
Maybe we'll get lucky,
He's in the system.

19:26.033 --> 19:27.434
If he's military,

19:27.501 --> 19:29.734
Why would he choose
A truck as his weapon?

19:29.801 --> 19:31.501
Maybe he drove a tank.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.834
That's a good question.

19:33.901 --> 19:36.634
Using a vehicle
On the open road is one thing,

19:36.701 --> 19:39.267
But...this is close quarters.

19:39.334 --> 19:41.133
Yeah. A truck is loud,
It draws attention.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.400
Plus he risked
Rendering it inoperable.

19:43.467 --> 19:44.467
Doesn't make any sense.

19:44.534 --> 19:45.534
It does to him.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.167
He needs to kill this way.

19:47.234 --> 19:49.167
I just don't know why.

19:49.234 --> 19:52.067
Guys, I think I know
What connects the victims.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.534
All of the victims
Drove red 2-door coupes.

19:54.601 --> 19:56.367
Don't you think that
Could be a coincidence?

19:56.434 --> 19:58.200
It's statistically
Significant.

19:58.267 --> 20:00.601
We haven't been able to find
Any other common denominators.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.200
If the unsub
Is targeting people
Because of their cars,

20:02.267 --> 20:04.934
Then his initial contact
With them would have
Been on the road.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.934
Reid: exactly.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.968
I spoke to the families

20:07.033 --> 20:08.701
About the victims'
Daily car travel,

20:08.767 --> 20:10.701
How they got to work,
The gym.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.767
There's one road all the
Victims have in common.

20:12.834 --> 20:15.801
Route 7.

20:15.868 --> 20:17.367
That mean something to you?

20:17.434 --> 20:19.267
Maybe we should take a drive.

20:19.334 --> 20:23.434
Anyone living outside bend
Who commutes toward eugene

20:23.501 --> 20:24.934
Uses route 7.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.667
It's the most dangerous
Stretch of highway

20:26.734 --> 20:27.868
In the state.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.434
They call it
"suicide 7."

20:29.501 --> 20:31.400
These crosses represent
Accidents?

20:31.467 --> 20:33.334
Fatalities.
The fire chief put them up

20:33.400 --> 20:35.334
To remind drivers
To be careful.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.701
2 lanes, no dividers.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.534
I'm assuming there's a lot
Of head-on collisions.

20:38.601 --> 20:40.033
Either that
Or they go off the side.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.701
Reid, you mentioned
The possibility

20:41.767 --> 20:43.534
Of a physical limitation,
Something that kept the unsub

20:43.601 --> 20:45.200
From attacking
In the traditional way.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.634
Yeah, I was thinking
About impotence,

20:46.701 --> 20:48.734
But we've ruled out
Sexual motivation.

20:48.801 --> 20:50.367
What if he'd been involved
In a crash?

20:50.434 --> 20:52.400
On this road.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.234
If the unsub is disabled,

20:54.300 --> 20:56.434
It explains why
He uses a truck.

20:56.501 --> 20:57.834
It gives him power,
Mobility.

20:58.901 --> 21:00.133
But what?

21:00.200 --> 21:03.067
The idea that he's avenging
His own physical suffering

21:03.133 --> 21:04.334
Speaks to a victim mentality

21:04.400 --> 21:06.100
That's inconsistent
With the profile.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.100
Maybe it's not just about
His own suffering.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.167
[music playing]

21:10.234 --> 21:13.267
* I'm alive *

21:13.334 --> 21:18.000
* I'm breathing clean fresh air
Today, I'm alive *

21:18.067 --> 21:19.133
* yes, I am *

21:19.200 --> 21:21.501
[horn blaring]

21:21.567 --> 21:23.133
Wake up, honey.

22:09.734 --> 22:12.400
[tires screeching]
[yelling]

22:20.100 --> 22:23.400
As we speak, this profile
And a description
Of the unsub's truck

22:23.467 --> 22:25.234
Are being released to state
And national media.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.234
In addition to what
We already know,

22:27.300 --> 22:28.367
We believe the unsub
Is ex-military,

22:28.434 --> 22:31.000
Most likely army or marines.

22:31.067 --> 22:33.567
We also believe
He's physically handicapped.

22:33.634 --> 22:35.634
From combat?
From an automobile accident.

22:35.701 --> 22:38.167
An accident that may have
Occurred along route 7,

22:38.234 --> 22:39.901
Where the unsub
Finds his victims.

22:39.968 --> 22:42.601
And that has something to do
With why he's going after
Red coupes?

22:42.667 --> 22:45.267
We believe that
He holds the driver
Of a comparable vehicle

22:45.334 --> 22:46.901
Responsible
For his accident.

22:46.968 --> 22:48.267
And this person
Is the object of his rage,

22:48.334 --> 22:49.534
But unable to confront them,

22:49.601 --> 22:52.000
He's taking revenge
Against a surrogate.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.934
These boxes contain
Accident reports

22:54.000 --> 22:56.534
From a strip of route 7
Between bend and eugene.

22:56.601 --> 22:58.367
There's about 5 years' worth.

22:58.434 --> 23:00.434
We're gonna need everyone
You can spare
To comb through them.

23:00.501 --> 23:02.834
We've also compiled a list
Of local rehabilitation
Facilities

23:02.901 --> 23:04.701
Where the unsub may have
Gone to recover.

23:04.767 --> 23:07.334
Use the profile
As you canvass these places.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.501
Remember, we're looking for
A white male in his early 40s,

23:09.567 --> 23:10.801
Former military...

23:10.868 --> 23:14.200
Who may have sustained
Serious injury
In a car accident.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.701
Though only owners
Of red coupes

23:15.767 --> 23:17.334
Have been targeted
At this point,

23:17.400 --> 23:19.300
We're asking
All the driving public

23:19.367 --> 23:20.734
To be vigilant
On the road.

23:20.801 --> 23:22.901
And if you know anyone
Who fits this description,

23:22.968 --> 23:25.400
Please contact the bend
Police department immediately.

23:25.467 --> 23:26.868
Thank you.

23:26.934 --> 23:28.167
[glass shatters]

23:28.234 --> 23:29.167
Woman: gil?

23:29.234 --> 23:31.934
I could use
Some help in here.

23:37.434 --> 23:38.901
I've got bare feet here.

23:38.968 --> 23:40.701
Could you maybe
Sweep up the glass?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.400
I think I have to go.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.000
I'm sorry.
What?

23:44.067 --> 23:45.100
Where are you going?

23:45.167 --> 23:46.634
Ow! Damn it!

23:46.701 --> 23:48.467
Gil, wait!

23:48.534 --> 23:50.100
What's happening to you?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.467
[door closes]

24:05.567 --> 24:06.567
How's dave doing?

24:06.634 --> 24:08.701
A few more possibles.

24:08.767 --> 24:10.367
I'll take them.

24:10.434 --> 24:11.734
Hotch.

24:11.801 --> 24:14.234
Just got a walk-in.
His name's gil bonner.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.501
What's his story?

24:15.567 --> 24:17.167
It's about the unsub's
Accident.

24:17.234 --> 24:18.601
He says it's his fault.

24:20.834 --> 24:24.100
It was late, and i'd spent
All day in eugene

24:24.167 --> 24:25.400
With my mom.

24:25.467 --> 24:27.234
She'd been sick.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.567
I shouldn't have been driving.

24:29.634 --> 24:33.033
But I just wanted to get home
To see my little girl.

24:33.100 --> 24:36.067
It was darker than usual.

24:36.133 --> 24:38.734
I remember the moon
Was just a sliver.

24:38.801 --> 24:40.868
Right outside the cascades,

24:40.934 --> 24:43.767
My phone started vibrating.

24:43.834 --> 24:45.601
And when I went
To reach for it,

24:45.667 --> 24:47.968
I knocked it off
The far side of the seat,

24:48.033 --> 24:50.267
And it fell down
By the door,

24:50.334 --> 24:52.400
And I thought I could reach.

24:52.467 --> 24:53.767
And you took your eyes
Off the road?

24:53.834 --> 24:56.033
If couldn't have been
For more than a few seconds.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.634
But when I looked back up,

24:57.701 --> 25:00.868
There were lights
And this horn was blaring.

25:00.934 --> 25:05.400
And I swerved at the last
Second, and then I just...

25:05.467 --> 25:08.200
Kept on going...

25:08.267 --> 25:09.767
Without a scratch.

25:09.834 --> 25:12.100
You'd gone into
The oncoming lane?

25:12.167 --> 25:14.868
What happened to
The other vehicle?

25:14.934 --> 25:16.100
Well, that's the thing.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.868
It was in my rearview mirror
And then it was gone.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.434
It vanished.

25:20.501 --> 25:21.734
Why didn't you stop?

25:21.801 --> 25:23.234
It didn't seem real.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.400
You're saying you just
Pretended it didn't happen?

25:26.467 --> 25:31.400
I guess if you tell yourself
Something for long enough...

25:31.467 --> 25:33.667
You can make anything true.

25:33.734 --> 25:35.400
Well, you're here now.

25:35.467 --> 25:36.968
Tell us about
The other vehicle.

25:37.033 --> 25:39.067
It was the truck
You're looking for.

25:39.133 --> 25:40.567
How do you know that?

25:40.634 --> 25:42.667
When I saw the news...

25:42.734 --> 25:46.400
It all made sense.

25:46.467 --> 25:49.100
It's come back for revenge.

25:49.167 --> 25:51.834
When did the accident occur?

25:51.901 --> 25:53.801
December '07.

25:53.868 --> 25:55.534
The second saturday.

25:55.601 --> 25:58.968
There are no accidents
Reported in december
Of 2007.

25:59.033 --> 26:00.367
No.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.634
That's...no.

26:02.701 --> 26:04.367
Maybe you have
Your dates wrong?

26:04.434 --> 26:07.167
It could have been november.

26:07.234 --> 26:10.567
Uh, memories are kind of
Like puzzle pieces,

26:10.634 --> 26:12.367
And it's--
It's quite possible

26:12.434 --> 26:14.634
That in suppressing
These for so long,

26:14.701 --> 26:17.234
You've sort of
Rearranged things.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.300
[sobs]

26:18.367 --> 26:20.300
How long
Was your mother sick?

26:20.367 --> 26:21.901
5 months.

26:21.968 --> 26:24.501
She...

26:24.567 --> 26:26.534
She died in january.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.501
That much I know.

26:31.767 --> 26:33.734
He's ex-military,
Good with his hands, repairs.

26:33.801 --> 26:34.834
Ok, thanks.

26:34.901 --> 26:36.567
Look, even with
That description,

26:36.634 --> 26:39.234
You're talking about
5 years' worth
Of patients.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.634
What if we could
Narrow it down
To a 5-month window,

26:41.701 --> 26:43.834
Between september '07
And january '08?

26:43.901 --> 26:45.467
What's this person
Done, exactly?

26:45.534 --> 26:46.834
Exactly?

26:46.901 --> 26:49.300
3 murders. And he's
Not gonna stop there.

26:49.367 --> 26:50.567
Murders?

26:50.634 --> 26:53.234
You do realize
The condition
Of our patients?

26:53.300 --> 26:55.501
A paraplegic can drive
With the right rigging.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.501
Is this about
Those hit-and-runs?

27:02.100 --> 27:04.033
There's something
You should see.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.968
He, uh, he left us about...
4 months ago.

27:07.033 --> 27:10.067
Didn't make the kind
Of progress that we'd hoped for.

27:10.133 --> 27:11.534
Getting himself
Back in shape?

27:11.601 --> 27:13.701
No, physically, he--
He made great strides.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.434
It was emotional issues.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.734
Anger issues?

27:16.801 --> 27:19.267
Did he ever talk about
Getting even?

27:19.334 --> 27:20.734
You can look for yourself.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.901
Ian coakley.

27:23.968 --> 27:26.033
We have the patients
Write and draw daily.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.701
Small tasks to help
Strengthen their hands.

27:28.767 --> 27:31.100
Ian spent most of
His time on those.

27:31.167 --> 27:33.234
You had to know
This guy was disturbed.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.634
It's part of healing.
We encourage this kind of--

27:35.701 --> 27:37.334
Murder fantasy.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.801
Grief can take on
Disturbing forms.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.901
Red car.

27:41.968 --> 27:44.334
They're all different,
Like he couldn't decide.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.100
When his memory came back,
It was...fluid.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.067
So it changed,
Like his targets.

27:49.133 --> 27:50.734
His mind was trying
To find out

27:50.801 --> 27:52.234
The truth
About what had happened.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.601
We need the date
Of his accident.

27:53.667 --> 27:54.934
September 28, 2007,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.601
Ian and sheila coakley
Crashed

27:56.667 --> 27:58.234
While driving home
From napa valley

27:58.300 --> 27:59.834
Going eastbound on route 7
Around midnight.

27:59.901 --> 28:01.501
It appeared their car
Was run off the road,

28:01.567 --> 28:03.634
Flipped numerous times,
No witnesses.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.734
His wife was riding
In the passenger seat.

28:05.801 --> 28:07.033
She died at the scene.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.067
Coakley survived.

28:08.133 --> 28:10.267
Paramedics indicated
Spinal cord injury.

28:10.334 --> 28:13.667
Morgan said he fractured
His t6 and t7 vertebrae.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.033
He's paraplegic.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.367
That's not all.
He's a former
Light-wheel mechanic

28:16.434 --> 28:18.234
In the army national guard.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.234
Does it say anything
About a red car?

28:20.300 --> 28:22.467
No. It says coakley
Suffered memory loss
After the accident.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.033
Short-term retrograde
Amnesia is common
After a serious accident.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.501
I think it's safe to say
He remembers now.

28:27.567 --> 28:28.534
Do we have
An address?

28:28.601 --> 28:29.934
Yeah, garcia's working
On that now.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.667
Ok. The house coakley
And his wife bought

28:32.734 --> 28:35.133
Was foreclosed on
10 months after his accident.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.701
Well, there's gotta be
A paper trail, then.

28:36.767 --> 28:39.200
Yeah, and that trail leads to
A land called nowhere.

28:39.267 --> 28:42.868
Cashed some insurance checks
During a stay at edelman house,

28:42.934 --> 28:44.234
But after he left, zilch.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.067
Any relatives
He could be staying with?

28:46.133 --> 28:48.901
No. I tried that.
There's no family
In the area.

28:48.968 --> 28:51.400
My exquisitely educated guess
Is he's either squatting

28:51.467 --> 28:53.334
Or subletting with cash.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.734
What about his truck?

28:54.801 --> 28:57.701
He owns a '79 dodge d100.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.400
He bought it used 10 years ago.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.467
He's had to rebuild it
Several times now.

29:01.534 --> 29:03.834
Parts can't be easy
To find for a truck
That old.

29:03.901 --> 29:06.467
I smell what
You're cooking, agent.

29:06.534 --> 29:09.634
Checking auto suppliers
In bend.

29:09.701 --> 29:12.734
Yeah, rossi gets
A fruit cup with lunch.

29:12.801 --> 29:14.834
He's having the parts
Drop-shipped

29:14.901 --> 29:17.200
Through syd's auto
And sent directly
To an address

29:17.267 --> 29:18.567
In southwest bend.

29:29.234 --> 29:30.701
Clear!

29:36.567 --> 29:38.133
It's clear!

29:40.868 --> 29:41.834
His truck is gone.

29:41.901 --> 29:43.501
We're all clear here.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.834
Get all your vehicles
Off this street,
Set up a perimeter.

29:45.901 --> 29:48.100
If coakley comes back
This way, we want
To be ready for him.

29:48.167 --> 29:49.734
Got it. Come on.

29:49.801 --> 29:50.901
Let's get to work.

29:50.968 --> 29:54.267
Rossi. Come on.
You want to see this.

29:58.901 --> 30:00.701
Look at the grilles.

30:00.767 --> 30:03.367
They still got blood on them.

30:07.567 --> 30:10.067
He's been switching plates.

30:10.133 --> 30:12.067
We should revise the bolo.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.400
Hey, rossi, look at this.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.334
Stalk central.

30:21.801 --> 30:24.067
That right there's
Shannon makely.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.133
Maria delgado jogging.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.400
Victor costella.

30:31.467 --> 30:33.067
They're all here.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.767
So who's this guy?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.334
You think it's possible

30:36.400 --> 30:38.801
There are other victims
We don't know about?

30:38.868 --> 30:40.934
I don't think so.
Garcia would have found them.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.667
Then I think we've found
His next target.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.501
Hey, baby girl.
I need you to run
A plate fast.

30:57.601 --> 30:58.901
Hey, garret.

30:58.968 --> 31:00.133
That's good.

31:18.467 --> 31:20.100
Mrs. Burke?

31:20.167 --> 31:21.200
Fbi.

31:21.267 --> 31:22.534
We're looking for
Your husband.

31:22.601 --> 31:24.534
Sorry, you just missed him.

31:24.601 --> 31:26.601
Uh...what is this about?

31:26.667 --> 31:28.267
We think he may be
In danger.

31:28.334 --> 31:29.701
Can you reach him
On his cell?

31:29.767 --> 31:31.300
No. He's on a ride.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.534
He doesn't take
His phone with him.

31:32.601 --> 31:33.634
A bike ride?

31:33.701 --> 31:35.267
Yes. He's in a club.

31:35.334 --> 31:36.901
He's on the open road.

31:36.968 --> 31:38.701
Do they have
A regular route?

31:38.767 --> 31:41.901
Um, saturdays--
Uh, they do

31:41.968 --> 31:43.367
The prineville
Reservoir loop.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.868
It's about a 50-mile
Round trip from here.

31:45.934 --> 31:47.367
Please...

31:47.434 --> 31:49.267
What is going on?

31:49.334 --> 31:51.834
We need you to tell us
Every road they take.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.133
Hey, I thought
You could use a hand.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.267
Oh, thank you.

31:57.334 --> 31:58.801
Have you heard anything
From hotch?

31:58.868 --> 32:01.467
Uh, they think they've
Located garret burke.

32:01.534 --> 32:04.267
If they can bring him in,
Coakley has nowhere to go.

32:04.334 --> 32:05.834
Well, he'll go somewhere.

32:05.901 --> 32:08.834
Hopefully, going through
This stuff will help us
Figure out where.

32:08.901 --> 32:10.801
All of his wife's things.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.467
He never unpacked them.

32:12.534 --> 32:14.968
He never unpacked anything,
As far as I can tell.

32:15.033 --> 32:18.000
What do you think this means,
Living like this?

32:18.067 --> 32:20.701
I think it means he's stuck.

32:40.434 --> 32:44.200
Hotch, we're on route 26
Heading toward the reservoir.

32:44.267 --> 32:47.667
I think we're about
Halfway around the loop.

32:47.734 --> 32:48.834
So far no sign of him.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.534
Copy that. We're heading
Southbound on 20.

32:50.601 --> 32:53.467
Hopefully we can hit route 26
Before they fly by us.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.567
Anything?

33:01.634 --> 33:03.300
9/26/07.

33:03.367 --> 33:05.801
That was was 2 days
Before the crash?

33:05.868 --> 33:07.334
They were really happy.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.868
Wait a second.

33:15.934 --> 33:17.300
[cell phone rings]

33:17.367 --> 33:21.067
Hotch, you know how coakley
Was driving his wife's car

33:21.133 --> 33:22.501
On the night
Of the accident?

33:22.567 --> 33:24.033
It was a red coupe.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.033
Are you sure?

33:25.100 --> 33:27.000
We have pictures.

33:27.067 --> 33:28.567
What does it mean?

33:28.634 --> 33:29.868
Maybe there was
No other car.

33:29.934 --> 33:31.467
Think about it.
What?

33:31.534 --> 33:34.667
The make and model
Of his target car
Keeps changing.

33:34.734 --> 33:36.100
Like he knows
They aren't right.

33:36.167 --> 33:38.167
And his doctor
At the rehab facility

33:38.234 --> 33:40.267
Called it fluid memory,

33:40.334 --> 33:41.634
But what if it was
More than that?

33:41.701 --> 33:43.934
So if it's
A single-car accident...

33:44.000 --> 33:45.234
It was coakley's fault.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.434
He was driving back
From napa valley that night.

33:47.501 --> 33:48.868
That's a long drive.

33:48.934 --> 33:50.300
Fell asleep at the wheel.

33:50.367 --> 33:51.968
Wouldn't be the first time.

33:52.033 --> 33:54.434
The guilt of that
Would be overwhelming,

33:54.501 --> 33:56.434
The truth almost
Impossible to take.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.968
So he's projecting blame.

33:58.033 --> 34:00.367
A red coupe did cause
The accident,

34:00.434 --> 34:02.033
And he was driving it.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.801
Hold on!

35:09.534 --> 35:11.434
Unh! Uhh...

35:16.901 --> 35:19.033
Are you hurt?

35:19.100 --> 35:20.534
[revving]

35:22.367 --> 35:23.868
Can you move?

35:23.934 --> 35:25.634
I'm ok. Go.

35:25.701 --> 35:28.467
[revving]

35:36.601 --> 35:40.634
You can't blame other people
For what you've done, coakley.

35:40.701 --> 35:42.367
Hotch: detective!

35:42.434 --> 35:43.501
Detective!

35:43.567 --> 35:45.000
You know the truth.

35:45.067 --> 35:47.200
No one else needs to die.

35:47.267 --> 35:48.801
It's not gonna help!

35:48.868 --> 35:51.667
There was no other
Red car, was there?

36:04.167 --> 36:05.300
No.

36:05.367 --> 36:06.601
No.

36:29.167 --> 36:30.734
Go!

36:30.801 --> 36:32.000
Go!

36:48.400 --> 36:51.467
[sirens]

36:57.467 --> 37:00.267
Where the hell
Is he going, rossi?

37:00.334 --> 37:02.601
There's no outlet up here.
He's hemmed in.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.634
No, don't do it, man.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.767
I don't know about you,

37:59.834 --> 38:03.100
But I haven't had
My bell rung like that
In a long time.

38:03.167 --> 38:05.400
No, I'm good, thanks.

38:05.467 --> 38:07.834
Impressive group
You travel with.

38:07.901 --> 38:09.934
They are.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.434
You knew what I said
To coakley

38:12.501 --> 38:14.701
Was gonna set him off.

38:14.767 --> 38:16.367
Challenging a delusion
Like his

38:16.434 --> 38:18.767
Can have unpredictable
Consequences.

38:18.834 --> 38:21.767
Like driving off a cliff.

38:21.834 --> 38:24.100
He made a choice.

38:24.167 --> 38:27.100
Well, I'm not gonna
Lose any sleep over it

38:27.167 --> 38:28.701
If it's ok with you.

38:34.601 --> 38:36.000
Uh, I'll catch up with you.

38:36.067 --> 38:37.801
Ok.

38:37.868 --> 38:39.868
Mr. Bonner.

38:41.067 --> 38:43.334
I got a message
That you wanted to see me.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.000
Yes. Thanks for coming in.

38:45.067 --> 38:46.601
I did some fact-checking.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.667
You said the moon
Was just a sliver that night.

38:48.734 --> 38:52.033
The new moon was
On november 10, 2007.

38:53.901 --> 38:55.267
What else did you find?

38:55.334 --> 38:58.601
A man named william madlock
Was run off the road that night

38:58.667 --> 39:01.534
By a car that drifted
Into his lane.

39:04.434 --> 39:06.767
No injuries?

39:06.834 --> 39:09.100
There was some damage
To his car.

39:09.167 --> 39:12.267
And you'll be held responsible
For fleeing the scene.

39:12.334 --> 39:13.968
A volkswagen?

39:14.033 --> 39:15.534
But it was a truck.

39:15.601 --> 39:17.300
Was it?

39:19.133 --> 39:22.934
I think you've wanted
To tell someone about this
For a very long time.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.634
And this case, that truck,

39:26.701 --> 39:29.801
Gave you the excuse
You needed.

39:31.033 --> 39:32.701
Guilt's a powerful thing.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
You didn't hurt anyone,
Mr. Bonner.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.067
Thank you.

39:53.567 --> 39:57.501
Garcia is...

39:57.567 --> 40:01.200
Contemplating a life
Of solitude and celibacy.

40:01.267 --> 40:02.200
[knocking]

40:02.267 --> 40:03.267
Hey.

40:04.934 --> 40:06.901
Hi.

40:06.968 --> 40:08.467
Did you get the job?

40:08.534 --> 40:10.734
Oh. No.

40:10.801 --> 40:13.000
I'm sorry.

40:14.167 --> 40:16.634
Only a...fool

40:16.701 --> 40:19.601
Would hire somebody
Over you for that job.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.033
Oh, no, they didn't
Hire anybody.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.367
The position just...

40:22.434 --> 40:24.467
[makes popping sound]
Went away.

40:24.534 --> 40:26.267
Went away?

40:26.334 --> 40:28.667
Yeah. Apparently there
Was a security breach.

40:28.734 --> 40:31.367
Someone hacked
The project database,

40:31.434 --> 40:33.801
And the whole project
Was put on hold.

40:33.868 --> 40:35.200
Oh.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.033
All that over
A little network hack.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.534
Well, you know,
You can't be too careful.
You know how that goes.

40:39.601 --> 40:40.701
Right.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.167
Well...

40:42.234 --> 40:45.367
It's probably
A blessing in disguise.

40:45.434 --> 40:47.868
I mean...
With your delicate stomach,

40:47.934 --> 40:50.534
You wouldn't have been able
To stand the food in karachi.

40:50.601 --> 40:52.534
[typing]

40:52.601 --> 40:57.667
I never told you
That it was in karachi.

40:57.734 --> 40:59.367
Didn't you?

40:59.434 --> 41:00.834
[laughs]

41:00.901 --> 41:03.167
Look, it's ok.

41:03.234 --> 41:06.601
I could not have gone
Without you.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.434
And I couldn't
Have gone with you.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.267
This place is my home.

41:11.334 --> 41:12.868
I know.

41:26.434 --> 41:29.033
Jj: "the human voice
Can never reach the distance

41:29.100 --> 41:32.200
That is covered by
The still, small voice
Of conscience."

41:32.267 --> 41:34.367
Mahatma gandhi.

41:34.434 --> 41:37.701
Come on, daddy!

41:37.767 --> 41:39.901
Let's go home!

41:42.434 --> 41:43.367
Heh heh.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.300
