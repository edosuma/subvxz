00:00.734 --> 00:03.003
-(drumbeat)
-(clapping)

00:05.039 --> 00:06.474
-(rhythmic breathing)
-(fanfare)

00:06.507 --> 00:10.578
ANNOUNCER: Fosse/Verdon.
All new, Tuesdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.217
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.021
(horror music playing)

00:23.424 --> 00:25.426
(snarls)

00:34.068 --> 00:36.437
(grunting)

00:49.950 --> 00:51.452
(roars)

00:52.486 --> 00:55.089
No! Not the tickles! (laughs)

00:55.123 --> 00:59.026
(gasps)

00:59.059 --> 01:01.929
Come on, honey. Let's go inside.

01:01.962 --> 01:06.033
-I have this pretty stick.
-Oh, it's a cool stick. (grunts)

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
This mud was probably
a little too much, huh?

01:13.907 --> 01:17.044
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

01:17.077 --> 01:20.080
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

01:20.114 --> 01:21.515
* Gonna leave you anyway. *

01:27.488 --> 01:29.290
GRETCHEN:
Holy shit.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.259
Holy shit.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.895
Holy shit! All of it?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.731
And with 24 hours to go.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.966
(both sigh)

01:38.999 --> 01:41.101
-(both scream)
-That was so much work!

01:41.135 --> 01:44.172
An incredible amount
of stupid, idiot work.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.906
-I hate work, and that was...
-Of which I did most.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.408
Okay, now that's
really open for debate.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.642
I'm just saying
that I did all of it.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.643
And not really the point.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.011
This is really my wedding.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.013
(sighs)
My second marriage, I'm eloping.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.915
-No doubt.
-Why isn't Edgar cooking us

01:54.948 --> 01:56.517
some pre-wedding fritters
or some shit?

01:56.550 --> 01:57.918
Oh, he's putting
the finishing touches

01:57.951 --> 01:59.987
on his Best Man Jimmy day.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.456
Yuck. Lindser and I got
to run all over town

02:02.490 --> 02:05.125
getting this face
and body camera-ready.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.327
Do you think I need to...?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.761
(chuckles) No one's gonna
be looking at you.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.996
Literally no one.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.831
You're invisible tomorrow.
No one gives a fuck.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.200
You could die.

02:12.233 --> 02:16.103
I can't believe
how not freaked out I am.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.672
I thought I would be shitting my
pants the day before my wedding,

02:18.706 --> 02:20.174
but I just feel so good

02:20.208 --> 02:22.042
since I came clean to you
about everything.

02:22.075 --> 02:27.014
You have given me a gift
no one has before.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.183
Acceptance. (chuckles)

02:29.217 --> 02:31.952
Unconditional acceptance.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.821
Jimmy, it's all I ever wanted.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.224
I finally feel truly safe.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.227
God, I'm genuinely touched.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.663
So safe, in fact...

02:42.696 --> 02:44.131
What are you doing there?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.999
So safe I feel like
I can do anything

02:46.033 --> 02:48.202
and you'll never leave me,
no matter what I do.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.505
Why would you do that?

02:51.539 --> 02:54.141
It's a metaphor for how I can
do anything I want now.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.576
Yeah, a metaphor
I'll be cleaning up.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.878
You know you don't need
to fix my problems, Jimmy.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.146
So you're gonna clean it up?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.181
Cleaning it up
ruins the metaphor.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.718
Paul! Did you get LASIK?

03:04.752 --> 03:07.755
Oh, good Lord. Costume changes?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.723
I guess I won't see you until...

03:09.757 --> 03:13.561
You're walking down the aisle in
hilariously incongruous white?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.697
BOTH:
Kiss, kiss, kiss,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.599
kiss, kiss,

03:18.632 --> 03:21.902
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

03:21.935 --> 03:23.170
-EDGAR: Kiss!
-LINDSAY: Have sex, have sex,

03:23.203 --> 03:25.573
-have sex, have sex.
-All right.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.208
Let's get this over with.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.510
Don't lose him.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.945
I need that piece of shit
to marry me tomorrow.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.381
-I won't.
-(chuckles)

03:33.414 --> 03:35.249
Ugh! I guess
I'll go get dressed.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.851
Wait! Before you put on
your pants,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.287
where's your favorite place
to go?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.921
-Nowhere.
-That's where we're going.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.358
Are you serious?
I don't have to put on pants?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.059
You can Donald Duck that shit

03:46.093 --> 03:48.896
because this is your day.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.198
Everything is coming to us.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.801
Manis, pedis, facials,
food, booze.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.638
Thank you. I am stupid excited
to hang out with you.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.874
-Same! Extra stupid.
-So...

04:00.908 --> 04:02.242
tell me the haps.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.612
What was it like
munching Yvette's puss?

04:04.645 --> 04:08.115
-(knocking on door)
-Oh. Mani-pedis must be early.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.421
Hello... sir?

04:14.522 --> 04:17.391
Sorry, wrong... door.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.427
(mouths)

04:19.460 --> 04:21.228
You have to get rid of her.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.664
I'm serious, whatever it takes.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.633
(sighs)

04:25.666 --> 04:26.867
(clears throat)

04:30.704 --> 04:32.105
(mouths)

04:32.139 --> 04:33.941
Mommy.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.176
Gretchen, why aren't you
wearing pants?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.945
Do you not shave above the knee?

04:37.978 --> 04:40.748
I thought you and Daddy
had plans today.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.616
Your father wanted to go
to the Reagan Library,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.585
but I've already been there
so many times.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.356
Hi, Mrs. Cutler. (chuckles)
So nice of you to surprise us.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.090
Gretchen, who is this person?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.359
Is that the right word?

04:51.392 --> 04:55.262
I want to be an ally,
but they make it so hard.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.098
-How's your hotel, Mommy?
-Dreadful.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.501
They put us near the elevator,

05:00.534 --> 05:01.935
so I made them move us.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.304
I had to go out into the hall,

05:04.338 --> 05:07.575
then we were near a baby,
so I...

05:08.241 --> 05:09.443
(clears throat)

05:09.477 --> 05:11.111
For your butt.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.581
Sorry! Got to go.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.452
You are bailing on me
the day before my wedding?

05:18.486 --> 05:20.120
I'm sorry.
I love you, I love you.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.989
You're on your own. Sorry!

05:24.692 --> 05:26.326
Is this a built-in couch?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.629
Must be impossible to clean.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.330
And you enjoy walking
on the bare floor?

05:35.436 --> 05:39.139
On the eve of this major
turning point in your life,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.742
we embark on three stops.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.677
This first stop

05:43.711 --> 05:47.681
represents a dream
from your past.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.584
Something you used to talk about

05:50.618 --> 05:52.085
but never got to do.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.690
Sochi 2014.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.660
You wouldn't stop talking
about curling.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.995
No sport more misunderstood.

06:02.029 --> 06:06.734
No players more understandably
hair-trigger defensive

06:06.767 --> 06:10.103
than those of curling.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.509
Fuck yeah.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.545
-* Ah, ah, ah *
-* Too cold *

06:17.578 --> 06:19.713
* Can't move, too cold *

06:19.747 --> 06:21.348
* Yes, sir *

06:21.381 --> 06:22.616
* Too cold *

06:22.650 --> 06:24.752
* I-Ice cold, watch your steps *

06:24.785 --> 06:26.520
-* Yeah, yeah *
-* I'm 'bout to watch
my breath *

06:26.554 --> 06:28.456
* So cold,
ain't got no threats *

06:28.489 --> 06:30.858
* Stand firm, arms folded
across my chest *

06:30.891 --> 06:32.192
* So cold *

06:32.225 --> 06:33.293
-* Ah, ah, ah *
-* Too cold *

06:33.326 --> 06:34.895
* They drop us below zero *

06:34.928 --> 06:36.564
* We ain't moving,
we too froze *

06:36.597 --> 06:39.933
* We can't move, we too cold *

06:39.967 --> 06:41.935
* Can't move, too cold *

06:41.969 --> 06:43.571
-* Yeah, yeah, yeah *
-* Can't move *

06:43.604 --> 06:44.738
* Too cold *

06:44.772 --> 06:46.106
* We can't move, we too cold *

06:46.139 --> 06:47.775
* Ah, ah, ah *

06:47.808 --> 06:50.544
* Can't move, too cold *

06:50.578 --> 06:52.813
-* Can't move *
-* Too cold *

06:52.846 --> 06:54.748
* We gon' weather any weather *

06:54.782 --> 06:56.817
* Won't fall down, no pressure *

06:56.850 --> 06:59.086
-* Oh, yeah *
-* Want my ego below zero *

06:59.119 --> 07:00.554
* When I'm humble, I'm better *

07:00.588 --> 07:02.723
* Boy, they sick,
get stretched *

07:02.756 --> 07:04.725
* This cold world
will come get you *

07:04.758 --> 07:06.594
* They'll pull you down
if you let 'em *

07:06.627 --> 07:09.062
* The clique froze,
I don't mean ice on the wrist *

07:09.096 --> 07:10.631
* Though, I mean
we ain't changing *

07:10.664 --> 07:12.299
* To get dough *

07:12.332 --> 07:14.101
* Cold don't mean
we ain't lit, though, yo *

07:14.134 --> 07:16.069
* You might be trippin'
if you see the vision *

07:16.103 --> 07:18.338
* You catch
at the clique's shows *

07:18.371 --> 07:19.807
* Fueled by the risen
who's livin' *

07:19.840 --> 07:21.642
* While others spit fire,
we spit snow... *

07:21.675 --> 07:23.043
(laughing)

07:25.713 --> 07:28.448
(grunting)

07:37.791 --> 07:39.993
-* We gon' weather any weather *
-* Yeah *

07:40.027 --> 07:41.261
* Won't fall down, no pressure *

07:41.294 --> 07:43.363
* Want my ego below zero *

07:43.396 --> 07:45.699
* When I'm humble, I'm better *

07:45.733 --> 07:47.267
* We still fly
with no feathers *

07:47.300 --> 07:49.336
* They'll pull you down
if you let 'em *

07:49.369 --> 07:51.204
* Oh *

07:51.238 --> 07:53.674
* Oh... *

07:53.707 --> 07:55.543
* Too cold. *

07:58.011 --> 08:00.981
(horror music playing)

08:02.349 --> 08:05.118
Hello?

08:05.152 --> 08:08.388
Are you... me?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.824
(screams)

08:10.858 --> 08:13.661
(chuckles):
Oh, thank God.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.996
For a second I thought
I was in a Black Swan.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.966
Becca is being reckless
with her health and, therefore,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.634
with the health of my progeny.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.503
She butt-dialed me
from a wine tour.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.639
Gretchen's bitch mom
ruined my day,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.040
so let's sort this sitch out.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.478
Becca? Get over here.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.146
And bring back
all the TP you stole.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.515
Last night I had to wipe
with a sock.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.154
Have you ever
considered curtains?

08:41.188 --> 08:44.491
How's Daddy? Is he playing a lot
of golf? How's his knee?

08:44.524 --> 08:48.996
He's fine. Oh, before I forget,
I need to see the seating chart.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.898
-Now?
-Thank you.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.269
Can you make it bigger?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.872
Go up.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.542
You sat Robert next to his son?
You have to change it.

09:02.576 --> 09:07.114
Who is this Paul person,
and why doesn't he have a table?

09:07.147 --> 09:08.682
What if you moved him...?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.918
No! Paul throws everything off!

09:12.085 --> 09:16.056
I'm sorry.
Uh, the chart took forever.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.058
Do you know
how embarrassing it is

09:18.091 --> 09:20.628
when people ask me about
the menu and the flowers,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.596
and I just have to shrug

09:22.630 --> 09:25.232
and say, "I suppose I'll see"?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.534
Other than that phone call
in the middle of the night

09:27.567 --> 09:29.903
to let me know that you
and Boone were getting married,

09:29.937 --> 09:33.907
you've haven't told me a thing.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.543
You sure we haven't talked
about the wedding since then?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.412
Positive.

09:39.446 --> 09:43.784
That's really funny,
because I just realized now

09:43.817 --> 09:46.386
that there might have been
an assumption

09:46.419 --> 09:48.889
that I might have
inadvertently forgotten

09:48.922 --> 09:50.758
to set the record straight,

09:50.791 --> 09:54.695
and you might
still think that...

09:55.796 --> 09:58.832
Mommy, I'm marrying Jimmy,
not Boone.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.171
-Mommy, I said I'm...
-I know you're marrying Jimmy.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.439
I'm not a complete idiot.

10:06.473 --> 10:10.310
Oh. Then why are you here?

10:10.343 --> 10:12.780
Our daughter is getting married.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.151
We've had front row seats
to all your mistakes,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.754
so why stop now?

10:20.788 --> 10:24.992
Do you have a saltine?
I'm a bit peckish.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.864
(cheering, clapping)

10:30.898 --> 10:32.866
EDGAR: Okay,
for our second stop, Jimmy,

10:32.900 --> 10:35.669
-this one represents...
-Oh, let me guess. My present.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.672
No. Your present is now,
why would you need to visit it?

10:38.706 --> 10:41.942
No, it's your past again,
but this one is bad.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.379
It's all the anger and stress
and anxiety you've held onto,

10:46.413 --> 10:50.517
and it is time to let it out.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.954
(crowd whooping, cheering)

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
It's a smash room.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.892
(screaming)

10:58.926 --> 11:03.931
A safe way to externally fight
the demons within.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.234
I can see how you might
be drawn to this,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.002
but as someone who lives
his life honestly,

11:09.036 --> 11:11.471
I have no need for a safe space

11:11.504 --> 11:15.909
to vent the impotent rage
I simply do not possess.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.945
("Revolution" by Varg playing)

11:20.080 --> 11:22.082
(crowd cheering)

11:27.687 --> 11:29.289
Yeah!

11:33.593 --> 11:36.864
(man singing in German)

11:36.897 --> 11:39.366
Aah!
Ah, yeah!

11:40.233 --> 11:41.234
(grunts)

11:43.236 --> 11:44.571
(cheering)

11:55.983 --> 11:57.284
Dial-ins!

11:57.317 --> 11:58.852
Sheila!

11:58.886 --> 12:00.453
Studio system!

12:00.487 --> 12:02.522
Signature cocktails!

12:02.555 --> 12:03.757
Vendors!

12:03.791 --> 12:05.192
Caterers!

12:05.225 --> 12:08.495
Depression!
(shouts)

12:20.573 --> 12:21.875
CROWD (chanting):
Do it! Do it!

12:21.909 --> 12:23.243
-(grunts)
-Do it!

12:23.276 --> 12:26.046
Do it! Do it! Do it!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.648
Do it!
Do it! Do it!

12:28.681 --> 12:30.683
(chanting stops)

12:32.252 --> 12:35.588
I'm getting married, Papa.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.890
Aw...

12:36.924 --> 12:40.427
(Jimmy crying)

12:40.460 --> 12:44.631
Paul, Becca, please keep in mind
what's important is the welfare

12:44.664 --> 12:48.568
of a child that's going
to exist soon,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.971
so let's clear the air
and everyone agree to stop

12:51.004 --> 12:54.007
ruining Paul's baby,
you heinous bitch.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.009
I'm not ruining his baby.

12:56.043 --> 12:59.813
I can't help it if the baby
craves unpasteurized cheese.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.748
-And sushi?
-I didn't eat sushi.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.851
It was sashimi.
Rice goes straight to my hips.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.152
Chillax, dorkus.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.419
It's good to challenge
babies' immune systems.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.188
That's how you make an X-Men.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.023
(sighs)

13:10.057 --> 13:12.926
You agreed to follow
a rigorous meal plan,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.295
to do yoga and Pilates,

13:15.328 --> 13:17.764
to play it trans-vaginal Mozart.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.933
My wife's not jacking it
with that dildo speaker

13:19.967 --> 13:21.534
to play your kid nerd music.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.137
-It's all in the contract.
-Since you brought it up,

13:24.171 --> 13:28.108
I do have a solid legal basis
for increased parental rights

13:28.141 --> 13:31.511
due to the altered method
of insemination.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.646
You want parental rights?

13:33.680 --> 13:37.851
No, I just said I have a legal
basis for parental rights.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.453
Plus, I do have a geriatric womb

13:40.487 --> 13:42.956
and might not ever
get pregnant again.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.792
What if I never get
pregnant again?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.195
I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping
we'd get a do-over someday.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.629
Tallulah's great, but face it,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.231
we're not turning
that boat around.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.534
Vernon, we have
to keep this baby.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.870
I can already feel
how much it loves me.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.972
She's bluffing. When Bec and I
were kids, she would threaten

13:59.006 --> 14:02.209
to kill herself if I didn't
give her my Choco Taco.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.711
Please. Just tell me how much.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.080
Paul, you can't put a price
on a mother's love.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.082
But if you want to put a price
on a mother's love,

14:09.116 --> 14:12.152
-low mid-to-mid six figs all in.
-Six?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.686
If you're not willing
to give everything you have

14:13.720 --> 14:17.290
for this baby,
maybe you don't really want it.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.362
I think you might be right.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.597
-What?
-I love the idea of a child,

14:24.631 --> 14:28.936
but I don't think
I'm ready for the reality.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.637
I think...

14:32.539 --> 14:34.307
I think I'm out.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.177
Thank you, Becca.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.280
-Paul, no.
-I'll be okay.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.850
Maybe I'll take the hundreds
of thousands of dollars

14:43.883 --> 14:45.518
I already put
into a college fund

14:45.552 --> 14:47.020
and use it towards my travels.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.522
Babies are the real trip.
All kinds of new experiences.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.292
The nonstop screaming,
clipping them tiny fingie nails,

14:52.325 --> 14:53.961
not being able
to run out right quick

14:53.994 --> 14:56.096
to see the new Minions movie
'cause some

14:56.129 --> 14:58.932
little dummy might roll over
onto her face and die.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.433
I think it may be best for all

15:00.467 --> 15:02.602
if I begin
my travels immediately.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.306
Paul, you can't leave.
It's your baby.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.652
-(laughs softly)
-(door opens)

15:22.522 --> 15:24.624
Wait, Paul! We were bluffing.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.793
I can't do it all over again.
You can't make me.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.129
20 grand, all in.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.499
30, or I kill myself.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.803
Fifteen.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.605
-Done.
-Done.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.446
And when she refused to stop
parking in front of our house,

15:46.479 --> 15:50.450
I simply had Enrique change
the sprinklers to go off

15:50.483 --> 15:54.521
right before she had to leave
for work in the morning.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.955
You think this marriage
is a mistake,

15:55.989 --> 15:57.324
and you weren't gonna
say anything?

15:57.357 --> 15:58.525
(groans softly)

15:58.558 --> 16:00.260
Do we have to talk about this?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.762
We were having such a nice day.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.597
Actually, we do have
to talk about it,

16:04.631 --> 16:07.300
and we're not having a nice day.
This is a terrible day.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.302
You are my mother,
and yet you refuse

16:09.336 --> 16:11.838
to ever talk to me
about anything real.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.473
I was just telling you all about

16:13.506 --> 16:15.442
the new Oriental family
next door.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.810
Anything real, Mother.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.381
You're so afraid you might hear
something unpleasant.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.850
(sighs) You always have
to be so provocative.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.385
It's the day
before my fucking wedding,

16:25.418 --> 16:27.154
and you know nothing about me!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.789
-What don't I know about you?
-(chuckles) Seriously?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.624
Let's see, uh,
in high school, I had

16:31.658 --> 16:33.126
more sex in your bed
than you did.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.561
Granny's Homer painting
that's been

16:34.594 --> 16:36.563
in the family for decades?

16:36.596 --> 16:39.199
Fake. I sold the original
to buy acid.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.834
I said that my piano teacher
"bad-touched me"

16:41.868 --> 16:44.237
to get out of a recital.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.906
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.077
Congratulations, Gretchen.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.911
You've driven
the help away again.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.348
The hamster didn't escape,
I forgot to feed him.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.485
Abortions? Yup!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.687
I didn't graduate from college.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.755
I know all of this, Gretchen.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.825
Bullshit.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.328
No way.
You would have tried to stop me.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.662
When could I ever control you?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.998
When did you ever try?

17:12.031 --> 17:15.402
Did you ever think
that maybe, just maybe,

17:15.435 --> 17:18.105
all the terrible shit I did
was a cry for help?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.740
-Your father and I didn't
want to indulge you.
-Why not?

17:20.773 --> 17:23.042
You wouldn't have figured out
how to take care of yourself.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.445
I can't take care of myself!

17:25.478 --> 17:28.281
I have been suffering
in the dark

17:28.315 --> 17:31.918
with a severe goddamn mental
illness for my entire life!

17:31.951 --> 17:33.720
Oh, stop it.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.455
Just because you're blue
now and again

17:35.488 --> 17:38.625
does not mean
that you have an illness.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.060
You caught me drowning
my American Girl dolls.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.795
Why didn't you do anything?!

17:42.829 --> 17:44.464
This is really too much.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.733
I tried to kill myself, Mommy.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.735
I did.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.138
When I was 17.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.707
I really wanted to die.
I really did.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.577
I sometimes still do.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.382
You're right.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.718
Nothing we did
was ever enough for you.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.556
Don't you think that
if I had talked to someone

18:09.589 --> 18:14.161
(crying):
when I was 13 or 17 or 26,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.429
that I would be better now?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.731
That I wouldn't be this person?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.066
What do you want?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.734
Do you want me to hold you

18:21.768 --> 18:23.636
and tell you
that I'm miserable, too?

18:23.670 --> 18:26.773
That I haven't felt love
for your father,

18:26.806 --> 18:29.075
for anyone, in 20 years?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.411
That I would kill
to have an affair

18:31.444 --> 18:34.514
but I'm too scared
of what people might say?

18:34.547 --> 18:38.385
Or worse,
that no one would have me?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.788
Yes.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.760
Well, I don't.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.662
Everyone's fine.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.097
(exhales)

18:51.130 --> 18:53.866
Life is good, Gretchen.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.503
I don't know
why you have to make it

18:56.536 --> 19:00.106
so difficult for yourself.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.376
I don't make it difficult.
It i difficult.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.018
To be honest, it feels like...

19:12.051 --> 19:13.520
No one wants
to hear these things.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.888
If you insist on sharing them,

19:15.922 --> 19:18.157
you'll just push everyone away.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.205
You're wrong, Mommy.

19:32.239 --> 19:36.008
Maybe it'll push you away,
but not Jimmy.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.216
(chuckles)

19:43.250 --> 19:45.218
(inhales sharply)

19:45.252 --> 19:49.188
Last stop on the train.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.491
(gasps)

19:51.524 --> 19:54.327
Is this a private club?

19:54.361 --> 19:57.163
Where powerful people talk
about their mistresses

19:57.196 --> 19:59.031
and topple governments?

19:59.065 --> 20:02.001
Yup. And you're now a member.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.203
It doesn't actually
unlock anything.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.239
You just show it and you get in.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.477
(laughter)

20:15.782 --> 20:17.950
Yep. Enjoy.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.352
No. No, they'll sniff me out.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.522
No, that-that's the point
of this day.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.192
You still think of yourself
as lowly, poor,

20:26.225 --> 20:30.263
undeserving on the outside,
but, Jimmy...

20:34.567 --> 20:36.235
(chuckles)

20:36.269 --> 20:38.471
...you belong now.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.911
Go ahead.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.316
(sighs)

20:49.349 --> 20:51.217
* And it all but seems *

20:51.250 --> 20:54.287
* My lifetime dreams
have ended *

20:56.155 --> 20:59.125
* And I know some people hope *

20:59.158 --> 21:01.193
* They won't come true *

21:02.429 --> 21:05.097
* On... *

21:08.435 --> 21:11.304
* Lankershim, Lankershim *

21:13.440 --> 21:19.846
* I can't start
to live here anymore *

21:19.879 --> 21:21.981
* Yeah *

21:22.014 --> 21:23.450
* Oh *

21:23.483 --> 21:27.454
* I walk away, I walk away *

21:37.497 --> 21:39.265
* When someone loves you *

21:39.298 --> 21:41.434
* But you just can't
figure it out *

21:41.468 --> 21:44.371
* Just walk away,
just walk away *

21:44.404 --> 21:47.173
* Just walk away *

21:48.508 --> 21:50.843
* Oh *

21:50.877 --> 21:54.013
* Oh, you walked away,
you walked away. *

21:59.586 --> 22:01.521
-(sighs)
-Carve out sauvignon blanc

22:01.554 --> 22:03.055
in the third trimester,

22:03.089 --> 22:05.858
and you can do whatever you want
with my placenta.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.495
(sighs)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.799
Threaten the well-being
of my child again,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
and I'll sue the britches
off of you.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.312
You jerk!

22:26.345 --> 22:28.080
-(exhales)
-You were gonna leave.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.682
I wasn't serious.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.819
I was calling Becca's bluff,
like you said.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.723
I believed you.
Well done.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.125
Anyway, I'm glad you're staying.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.764
So, I guess I'll see you
tomorrow for the big day.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.833
Give me a call
if you need anything,

22:46.866 --> 22:49.235
or even if you
just want to talk.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.337
Does anybody talk
on the phone anymore?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.172
(both laugh)

22:53.205 --> 22:55.708
"Klondike one nine,
patch me through, Midge."

22:55.742 --> 22:57.209
(both laugh)

22:57.243 --> 23:00.046
I don't know what you're doing,
but okay.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.948
Bye, Paul.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.953
(clears throat)

23:06.986 --> 23:09.556
(door opens, closes)

23:09.589 --> 23:10.590
(chuckles)

23:11.624 --> 23:13.626
(phone ringing and buzzing)

23:20.433 --> 23:22.401
Did I forget something?

23:22.435 --> 23:25.071
No. You said to call.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.741
Oh. Do you want me
to come back in?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.812
No.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.481
This is nice.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.249
Hey, Paul?

23:37.283 --> 23:39.251
Yes?

23:39.285 --> 23:42.088
How do fish sleep?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.425
Oh, golly.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.427
It's weirder than you think.

23:48.461 --> 23:52.164
For starters,
fish don't have eyelids.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.933
Wow.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.408
-You're leaving?
-I have to go meet your father
at the hotel.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.744
Apparently,
he and the docent got into it

24:04.777 --> 24:06.178
about Reagan's handling of AIDS,

24:06.212 --> 24:08.581
and he's still
a little wound up.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.182
I will see you tomorrow.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.251
-You're still coming?
-You know,

24:12.284 --> 24:15.121
I see young people,
daughters of my friends

24:15.154 --> 24:17.289
struggling with the question
of having children,

24:17.323 --> 24:21.160
and I just want to tell them,
"Don't.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.530
It's not worth it."

24:23.563 --> 24:25.532
-Mom.
-I'm serious.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.300
What pleasure is it?

24:29.335 --> 24:32.505
You don't like me.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.542
Your brother's a child.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.878
You wanted real.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.681
Whatever you think of me,

24:41.714 --> 24:46.352
it's my job to want more for you
than you want for yourself.

24:46.385 --> 24:49.455
But if you need someone
who doesn't push you

24:49.488 --> 24:52.458
and embraces your flaws,

24:52.491 --> 24:55.461
I'm glad you found Jimmy.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.365
I wish you had that, too, Mommy.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.272
See you tomorrow.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.910
(door opens)

25:10.943 --> 25:12.311
(door closes)

25:12.344 --> 25:14.914
(sighs)

25:15.948 --> 25:19.085
What a rush. I was on fire.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.053
They followed my stories.

25:21.087 --> 25:25.391
They understood my obscure
allusions and complex wordplay.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.526
They loved me!

25:27.560 --> 25:29.762
You just found your people,
Jimmy.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.932
You found my people.

25:32.965 --> 25:36.502
You know, it is both
infuriating and humbling

25:36.535 --> 25:39.105
how thoughtful
of a friend you are.

25:39.138 --> 25:43.342
You've seen me
at my worst, and yet...

25:43.375 --> 25:46.178
you've always seen my worth.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.248
And still, it took me years,

25:49.281 --> 25:50.783
literally, to see yours.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.753
-It's okay, Jimmy.
-No. No, it's not.

25:53.786 --> 25:58.424
You are and have always been
my best man

25:58.457 --> 26:00.459
and my best friend.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.362
Thanks, Jimmy, I, uh...

26:03.395 --> 26:05.064
I thought this conversation
would be easier

26:05.097 --> 26:06.565
after everything we did today.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.541
I wanted to remind you
how far you've come,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.244
how much you've grown,

26:18.277 --> 26:20.246
so I can say this:

26:20.279 --> 26:22.248
don't marry her.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.484
You told me not to lie to you,

26:25.517 --> 26:27.253
and the truth is,
you can't do it.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.921
You can't marry Gretchen.

26:28.955 --> 26:33.125
No. No, Edgar, we're...
we're in a good place.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.929
I mean, she came clean with me.
She's stopped lying to me.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.331
-For me.
-I don't think it's enough.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.100
Because even when
you tell each other the truth,

26:41.133 --> 26:42.501
you don't do anything about it

26:42.534 --> 26:44.270
and you just end up
hurting each other.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.405
I'm not gonna hurt Gretchen.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.008
Not in ways that count.
She's a tough girl.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.577
-Beautiful. Are those your vows?
-Fuck you.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.179
You guys hold
how you don't judge each other

26:53.212 --> 26:54.914
as this great thing,
but it's really not.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.784
It's just a justification
for your guys' selfishness.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.419
You love each other,
but that's not the same thing

27:00.452 --> 27:02.121
as being good for each other.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.990
-You stop talking.
-I'm sorry, Jimmy.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.491
I'm right.
You know I'm right.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.626
I don't give a shit

27:07.660 --> 27:10.329
what you think
about our relationship.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.531
I never have.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.801
You're pathetic.
You're nothing!

27:14.834 --> 27:16.435
I talked to the venue
and the caterers.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.804
-Stop it.
-And they are willing

27:17.837 --> 27:20.206
to give you half your deposit
back if you cancel now.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.608
We can get in my car
and drive to the desert.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.844
We can drive to San Francisco.
We can just drive wherever,

27:24.877 --> 27:26.045
just as long as you...

27:26.078 --> 27:28.815
-We are done.
-Jimmy.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.184
I don't want to see you
ever again.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.325
(voice breaking):
You'll destroy each other.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.330
There is no way I'd rather go.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.669
(sniffles)

27:53.773 --> 27:56.743

28:21.901 --> 28:24.536
* Marry me *

28:24.570 --> 28:27.874
* I'll give you every color
of the rainbow *

28:27.907 --> 28:29.175
-(glass crunches)
-Aah!

28:29.208 --> 28:30.676
(inhales sharply)

28:30.709 --> 28:32.344
(groaning)

28:32.378 --> 28:35.114
* They'll say it can't be done *

28:35.147 --> 28:39.185
* But what do they know? *

28:39.218 --> 28:42.588
* You'll never be alone *

28:42.621 --> 28:45.892
* And I'm a baritone *

28:45.925 --> 28:49.896
* Marry me *

28:49.929 --> 28:52.464
* I'll gaze into your eyes *

28:52.498 --> 28:56.903
* And say I love you *

28:56.936 --> 29:02.909
* There'll always be a rainbow
right above you *

29:02.942 --> 29:06.913
* Forever and a day *

29:06.946 --> 29:11.951
* We'll watch our children play,
I know... *
