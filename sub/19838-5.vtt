00:18.820 --> 00:21.250
<b>Yes! Halfway there!</b>

00:21.250 --> 00:23.570
<b>That makes fifty types!</b>

<b>15 x 15</b>

01:50.410 --> 01:53.590
<b>Genthru and his men have a plan in mind,</b>

01:53.590 --> 01:56.620
<b>as they prepare to trade

01:57.660 --> 02:00.080
<b>Let's get this over with, then.</b>

02:07.960 --> 02:10.990
<b>Okay, trade complete.</b>

02:10.990 --> 02:13.070
<b>No, hold on.</b>

02:14.050 --> 02:15.820
<b>I cannot accept this.</b>

02:16.610 --> 02:18.610
<b>This is an unfair trade.</b>

02:18.950 --> 02:21.620
<b>What? Don't complain once it's done!</b>

02:22.090 --> 02:24.310
<b>We gave you three cards!</b>

02:24.310 --> 02:26.720
<b>What more do you want?</b>

02:27.050 --> 02:29.790
<b>Wait a second... 
That isn't what I meant.</b>

02:30.450 --> 02:32.870
<b>I'm saying that it's unfair to you.</b>

02:33.800 --> 02:36.480
<b>It's too skewed in our favor.</b>

02:36.480 --> 02:39.030
<b>I dislike the idea of 
benefiting from charity.</b>

02:39.800 --> 02:42.800
<b>And it will continue to bother me,</b>

02:42.800 --> 02:45.120
<b>even if we clear the game first.</b>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.710
<b>So I have a proposition.</b>

02:48.710 --> 02:50.320
<b>Right or left.</b>

02:50.320 --> 02:52.560
<b>I'll give you one of these cards.</b>

02:53.000 --> 02:55.170
<b>One is worthless,</b>

02:55.170 --> 02:57.070
<b>but the other is Breath of Archangel.</b>

02:57.940 --> 02:59.190
<b>Good Luck</b>

02:59.520 --> 03:00.450
<b>Okay!</b>

03:08.240 --> 03:09.310
<b><i>Levy on!</i></b>

03:14.450 --> 03:15.170
<b>Crap!</b>

03:15.600 --> 03:16.960
<b><i>Return on.</i></b>

03:16.960 --> 03:18.030
<b>To Masadora!</b>

03:22.340 --> 03:23.750
<b>Let's go after them!</b>

03:23.750 --> 03:24.700
<b>Wait!</b>

03:24.700 --> 03:26.260
<b>First, check your cards!</b>

03:28.920 --> 03:31.880
<b>I lost one of the #80 cards 
we were monopolizing.</b>

03:32.400 --> 03:34.140
<b>As well as a #65.</b>

03:34.140 --> 03:36.230
<b>Hey, what did you lose?</b>

03:36.230 --> 03:38.940
<b>I lost #42 and #53.</b>

03:38.940 --> 03:41.500
<b>I lost #29 and #24.</b>

03:41.500 --> 03:42.500
<b>They got me good!</b>

03:42.860 --> 03:45.660
<b>I lost two of the #85 
cards we were hoarding.</b>

03:46.060 --> 03:48.900
<b><i>All the ones they took were 
restricted slot cards...</i></b>

03:48.900 --> 03:51.770
<b><i>And they took both card types 
that we were monopolizing.</i></b>

03:52.630 --> 03:53.490
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

03:53.490 --> 03:55.540
<b><i>They must have used Risky Dice.</i></b>

03:57.970 --> 03:59.750
<b>We're not with them!</b>

03:59.750 --> 04:02.970
<b>They used items to change our faces!</b>

04:04.690 --> 04:06.650
<b>Anyway, we have to pursue them!</b>

04:06.650 --> 04:07.730
<b>No!</b>

04:07.730 --> 04:10.140
<b>Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?</b>

04:10.610 --> 04:12.550
<b>U-Uh, we don't know.</b>

04:12.550 --> 04:17.900
<b>But he went like this with his hand and
blew the head off the guy I was with.</b>

04:19.540 --> 04:22.700
<b>A power clearly meant for murder.</b>

04:23.360 --> 04:26.070
<b>So he's a fighter.</b>

04:26.540 --> 04:29.480
<b>It would be unwise to 
fight them head-on.</b>

04:29.480 --> 04:34.330
<b>But they took at least five
 different card types from us!</b>

04:34.740 --> 04:36.890
<b>They could have completed 
their collection!</b>

04:37.560 --> 04:38.620
<b><i>List on!</i></b>

04:38.620 --> 04:39.590
<b>#2!</b>

04:40.340 --> 04:42.340
<b>Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore. 
Currently, 0 cards in play.</b>

04:43.090 --> 04:44.560
<b>We're still okay.</b>

04:44.560 --> 04:48.300
<b>They haven't found #2, 
Patch of Shore, yet.</b>

04:48.790 --> 04:50.470
<b>Our immediate priority</b>

04:50.940 --> 04:53.850
<b>is to find #2 before they do!</b>

04:54.320 --> 04:57.110
<b>We still have our voucher 
for Breath of Archangel,</b>

04:57.110 --> 04:58.380
<b>so we can still beat them.</b>

04:58.380 --> 05:00.730
<b>Right, let's find it first, then.</b>

05:00.880 --> 05:03.650
<b>Accompany

05:01.210 --> 05:02.670
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

05:03.100 --> 05:04.320
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

05:10.320 --> 05:12.260
<b>We did it... A big success.</b>

05:12.260 --> 05:15.820
<b>The Risky Dice and Levy 
combination paid off.</b>

05:15.820 --> 05:17.560
<b>That puts us at ninety-three types.</b>

05:17.560 --> 05:21.010
<b>No, we used one up to 
change those faces,</b>

05:21.010 --> 05:22.170
<b>so it's ninety-two.</b>

05:22.750 --> 05:26.310
<b>The important thing is that we took 
the cards they were monopolizing.</b>

05:26.310 --> 05:30.300
<b>And for two of the others, we're just 
waiting for someone to use Gain on them.</b>

05:30.300 --> 05:32.680
<b>The biggest obstacle is #2.</b>

05:33.150 --> 05:36.310
<b>But we know that it's in Soufrabi.</b>

05:36.740 --> 05:39.150
<b>All right, we'll go after #72,</b>

05:39.150 --> 05:41.870
<b>#21, and #9 in that order.</b>

05:41.870 --> 05:44.320
<b>Then we'll make for 
Soufrabi, to find #2.</b>

05:44.950 --> 05:49.020
<b>For #75, we simply need to find 
someone with it, then take it.</b>

05:50.290 --> 05:52.500
<b>I think it's time we began thinking...</b>

05:53.990 --> 05:57.280
<b>About the three restricted 
slot cards we want to keep,</b>

05:58.090 --> 06:00.350
<b>and how we want to spend the 50 billion.</b>

06:02.080 --> 06:03.390
<b>Hey, Killua...</b>

06:03.390 --> 06:05.440
<b>Something's been bugging me.</b>

06:05.440 --> 06:06.340
<b>Huh?</b>

06:06.920 --> 06:09.350
<b>Aren't there hundreds of players?</b>

06:09.350 --> 06:12.060
<b>Isn't it weird that we've been able</b>

06:12.060 --> 06:14.470
<b>to turn all our items into cards?</b>

06:14.470 --> 06:15.470
<b>What do you mean?</b>

06:16.030 --> 06:21.480
<b>Even B-rank restricted slot types 
have a thirty-card limit.</b>

06:21.980 --> 06:26.310
<b>The players here before us should 
have already collected them.</b>

06:26.310 --> 06:27.660
<b>That's true.</b>

06:27.660 --> 06:29.610
<b>But you can also see it this way.</b>

06:30.410 --> 06:34.120
<b>Fewer than thirty teams in this game 
are capable of making real progress.</b>

06:34.490 --> 06:35.870
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

06:36.720 --> 06:40.980
<b>Most players aren't worried 
about getting restricted slot cards.</b>

06:40.980 --> 06:45.510
<b>They're just struggling to find 
a way out of the game.</b>

06:46.510 --> 06:50.260
<b>It would suck if you got to Masadora, 
and there weren't any Leave cards.</b>

06:50.680 --> 06:52.140
<b>Yeah, that's why...</b>

06:55.690 --> 06:56.640
<b>I get it...</b>

06:57.060 --> 06:57.750
<b>Huh?</b>

06:58.080 --> 07:01.600
<b>If you guys got to Masadora, 
but there weren't any Leave cards,</b>

07:01.600 --> 07:02.650
<b>what would you do?</b>

07:03.050 --> 07:04.380
<b>Well...</b>

07:04.750 --> 07:08.150
<b>I'd save money until a Leave showed up.</b>

07:08.500 --> 07:09.340
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:09.340 --> 07:11.010
<b>Okay, then what if</b>

07:11.010 --> 07:13.880
<b>you acquired a super rare 
spell card while waiting?</b>

07:13.880 --> 07:17.530
<b>Sell it and buy more spell 
cards until a Leave came in.</b>

07:17.530 --> 07:18.470
<b>Really?!</b>

07:19.300 --> 07:21.210
<b>I would save it...</b>

07:21.210 --> 07:25.450
<b>Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you 
bought ended up being worthless?</b>

07:25.900 --> 07:29.040
<b>If you saved it, you might be 
able to trade for a Leaveâ€”</b>

07:31.630 --> 07:32.330
<b>See?</b>

07:40.710 --> 07:41.810
<b>Need a Leave?</b>

07:43.350 --> 07:46.270
<b>Want to go back to the real world?</b>

07:57.790 --> 08:01.330
<b>We've gotten four restricted 
slot cards for three Leaves.</b>

08:01.780 --> 08:04.710
<b>Okay, that makes a total 
of fifty-four types.</b>

08:05.060 --> 08:06.720
<b>Score!</b>

08:09.100 --> 08:13.900
<b>So the cards that wouldn't fit in 
our binders reverted to items.</b>

08:14.410 --> 08:17.070
<b>We're running out of free pockets.</b>

08:17.360 --> 08:19.100
<b>Then we should organize them now.</b>

08:20.300 --> 08:24.020
<b>We three have a total 
of 135 free pockets.</b>

08:24.600 --> 08:26.840
<b>We should each leave 
around 5 pockets free.</b>

08:26.840 --> 08:29.480
<b>You keep the spell cards, Killua.</b>

08:29.480 --> 08:31.610
<b>Bisky should also have 
a few defensive ones.</b>

08:31.990 --> 08:33.860
<b>Wait! I have to use spell cards?</b>

08:34.270 --> 08:36.570
<b>No way! I don't know how they work.</b>

08:36.570 --> 08:38.490
<b>The hell? Then learn how they work!</b>

08:39.480 --> 08:40.160
<b>Okay...</b>

08:41.300 --> 08:42.010
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

08:43.570 --> 08:47.680
<b>We've been deliberately 
avoiding other players,</b>

08:47.680 --> 08:52.660
<b>but we'll have to take risks 
to obtain the rarer cards.</b>

08:52.660 --> 08:53.630
<b>Yeah.</b>

08:53.990 --> 08:57.140
<b>Well, let's get what we can ourselves,</b>

08:57.140 --> 09:00.390
<b>then negotiate aggressively
 with any players we come across.</b>

09:00.710 --> 09:02.040
<b>Sound good?</b>

09:02.430 --> 09:03.190
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:03.190 --> 09:04.020
<b>Yep!</b>

09:06.130 --> 09:07.000
<b>See ya.</b>

09:07.350 --> 09:08.400
<b>Hold on.</b>

09:12.120 --> 09:13.610
<b>This is worthless.</b>

09:13.610 --> 09:15.280
<b>It's a transformed Fake.</b>

09:15.710 --> 09:18.460
<b>Sorry about that. 
I gave you the wrong one.</b>

09:18.460 --> 09:19.750
<b>Here's the real one.</b>

09:21.350 --> 09:25.290
<b>Man, you can't lower your guard 
around any of these guys.</b>

09:25.290 --> 09:26.610
<b>No kidding...</b>

09:26.610 --> 09:30.410
<b>Still, that necklace is quite useful.</b>

09:32.670 --> 09:37.180
<b>Hey, this necklace can 
remove curses, right?</b>

09:37.770 --> 09:40.390
<b>Only from spell cards.</b>

09:40.390 --> 09:42.670
<b>Oh, so it won't work.</b>

09:42.670 --> 09:44.180
<b>Did you have an idea?</b>

09:44.560 --> 09:47.710
<b>I was wondering if a curse 
was behind the disease</b>

09:47.710 --> 09:50.110
<b>that all those villagers 
were suffering from.</b>

09:50.630 --> 09:51.800
<b>Villagers?</b>

09:52.440 --> 09:54.320
<b>Oh, those people...</b>

09:55.860 --> 09:58.240
<b>The ones who took all your money.</b>

09:58.780 --> 10:01.560
<b>But it won't work since 
they aren't cards.</b>

10:01.560 --> 10:02.240
<b>No.</b>

10:03.340 --> 10:05.110
<b>It's worth a shot.</b>

10:09.680 --> 10:13.250
<b>Will you trust us with your lives?</b>

10:17.480 --> 10:21.930
<b>You freely gave us everything you had.</b>

10:23.470 --> 10:24.760
<b>We will trust you!</b>

10:29.940 --> 10:32.860
<b>Sick Villagers 

Villagers struck by a

10:34.630 --> 10:35.940
<b>Healthy Villagers 

Healthy villagers who 
recovered from the contagion

10:36.470 --> 10:37.560
<b>It worked!</b>

<b>Thank you very much!</b>

10:41.870 --> 10:44.950
<b>This treasure has been

10:45.350 --> 10:47.050
<b>Please accept this

<b>Another player has used

11:03.230 --> 11:05.220
<b>Yo, this is Kazsule.</b>

11:05.880 --> 11:07.670
<b>I'd like to talk to you.</b>

11:07.670 --> 11:09.100
<b>Could we meet in person?</b>

11:09.100 --> 11:10.230
<b>About what?</b>

11:10.710 --> 11:12.980
<b>Some people are close 
to clearing the game.</b>

11:13.300 --> 11:14.200
<b>Huh?</b>

11:14.200 --> 11:17.350
<b>It's a team of three, 
led by someone named Genthru.</b>

11:18.310 --> 11:19.320
<b>Genthru!</b>

11:22.820 --> 11:24.900
<b>Thanks for coming, everyone.</b>

11:24.900 --> 11:26.160
<b>Much appreciated.</b>

11:26.310 --> 11:27.910
<b>Team Kazsule</b>

11:26.550 --> 11:27.910
<b>As I mentioned via Contact,</b>

11:28.060 --> 11:29.910
<b>Team Asta</b>

11:28.420 --> 11:31.760
<b>Team Genthru is close 
to completing the game.</b>

11:30.060 --> 11:32.170
<b>Team Hanse</b>

11:32.170 --> 11:34.130
<b>I just checked the ranking,</b>

11:32.310 --> 11:34.590
<b>Goreinu</b>

11:34.130 --> 11:35.980
<b>and they're currently 
at ninety-six types.</b>

11:34.710 --> 11:36.670
<b>Team Yabibi</b>

11:36.670 --> 11:39.250
<b>We must figure out a way to stop them.</b>

11:40.210 --> 11:41.210
<b>Can I ask something?</b>

11:41.210 --> 11:41.930
<b>What is it?</b>

11:41.930 --> 11:44.440
<b>How do you check the ranking?</b>

11:44.440 --> 11:45.100
<b>Well...</b>

11:45.100 --> 11:46.680
<b>You don't know how to do that?</b>

11:47.040 --> 11:49.920
<b>If we answer all their questions, 
we'll be here till dawn!</b>

11:49.920 --> 11:52.310
<b>Just cut to the chase.</b>

11:52.650 --> 11:54.250
<b>Now, don't be so mean...</b>

11:54.250 --> 11:56.570
<b>We're all here to exchange information.</b>

11:56.570 --> 12:00.800
<b>They could have information 
you don't, Asta.</b>

12:01.650 --> 12:03.320
<b>That's impossible.</b>

12:03.620 --> 12:07.700
<b>Those kids are amateurs who don't even 
know how to use the Trade Shop.</b>

12:08.400 --> 12:09.910
<b>In the Trade Shop,</b>

12:09.910 --> 12:12.830
<b>there's a ranking that lists 
players and their total</b>

12:12.830 --> 12:14.330
<b>restricted slot cards.</b>

12:14.770 --> 12:18.840
<b>If you pay a fee, you can even learn 
the numbers of their cards.</b>

12:18.840 --> 12:22.940
<b>But getting a player's name from 
the ranking still won't let you</b>

12:22.940 --> 12:25.750
<b>use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.</b>

12:25.750 --> 12:27.240
<b>Not until you actually meet them.</b>

12:28.220 --> 12:31.740
<b>Don't you feel smarter now, boys?</b>

12:33.570 --> 12:36.690
<b>In other words, if we know 
the members of a team,</b>

12:36.690 --> 12:39.900
<b>we can determine how 
many cards they have.</b>

12:40.160 --> 12:43.680
<b>And Team Genthru is only missing #0,</b>

12:43.680 --> 12:46.370
<b>#2, #9, and #75.</b>

12:46.680 --> 12:48.030
<b><i>#75...</i></b>

12:49.040 --> 12:51.800
<b>There's a solid theory that #0 appears</b>

12:51.800 --> 12:54.910
<b>in an event after the other 
ninety-nine are collected,</b>

12:54.910 --> 12:56.250
<b>so they only need three.</b>

12:56.550 --> 13:00.830
<b>We propose to find one of those 
three types before they do</b>

13:00.830 --> 13:04.760
<b>and monopolize it, to prevent 
them from clearing the game.</b>

13:05.030 --> 13:06.490
<b>There's gotta be something else.</b>

13:06.490 --> 13:09.890
<b>We could deluge them with spell cards.</b>

13:10.190 --> 13:13.150
<b>They already have a Paladin's Necklace.</b>

13:13.480 --> 13:15.650
<b>So Levy is the only 
spell that will work.</b>

13:14.460 --> 13:19.650
<b>Levy 

Take 1 card at random from every 
player within 20 meters of caster. 

[SR][SP]</b>

13:16.060 --> 13:19.650
<b>And they can block Levy if 
certain conditions are met.</b>

13:19.940 --> 13:21.150
<b>It's safe to assume</b>

13:21.150 --> 13:24.410
<b>that Genthru is willing to reveal 
that they have ninety-six types</b>

13:24.630 --> 13:28.910
<b>Prison 

All slotted cards on target page are 
immune to theft or destruction via spell card 
until removed. 
(Only targets 
pages 1 - 11. 
Free slot pages 
cannot be targeted.) 

[DEF][CONT]</b>

13:24.950 --> 13:28.910
<b>because their pages are 
protected by Prison.</b>

13:29.120 --> 13:30.310
<b>That's possible...</b>

13:31.040 --> 13:34.280
<b>Genthru was collecting 
a bunch of spell cards</b>

13:34.280 --> 13:36.550
<b>with the others who tried to recruit us.</b>

13:36.950 --> 13:38.240
<b>It's a reasonable assumption.</b>

13:39.060 --> 13:41.520
<b>We could always take 
their cards by force.</b>

13:41.520 --> 13:44.140
<b>Would you be willing to lead the attack?</b>

13:44.140 --> 13:47.730
<b>We don't know what kind 
of abilities they have.</b>

13:49.280 --> 13:52.960
<b>Finding a card type to monopolize 
is the most practical option.</b>

13:53.500 --> 13:55.430
<b>I assume no one has objections.</b>

13:56.710 --> 13:58.290
<b>Then let's get to business.</b>

13:58.290 --> 14:01.150
<b>We'll need everyone here to cooperate.</b>

14:01.640 --> 14:03.230
<b>I'm fine with the proposed plan.</b>

14:03.230 --> 14:05.320
<b>But I have a problem with these members.</b>

14:05.320 --> 14:06.750
<b>Hold on, Asta.</b>

14:07.150 --> 14:09.510
<b>I followed your condition...</b>

14:09.510 --> 14:11.890
<b>Have over fifty types of cards.</b>

14:12.480 --> 14:14.950
<b>These six teams met that condition.</b>

14:14.950 --> 14:19.990
<b>I also said that they had to be 
people who could contribute.</b>

14:20.410 --> 14:25.220
<b>I don't see how these kids 
can contribute anything.</b>

14:25.700 --> 14:28.470
<b>You're the one being uncooperative.</b>

14:28.930 --> 14:30.710
<b>You've got a smart mouth.</b>

14:31.090 --> 14:34.520
<b>Then show me some proof 
that you can be useful.</b>

14:34.520 --> 14:36.620
<b>We know Team Genthru's abilities.</b>

14:36.930 --> 14:40.480
<b>We have one of the three 
cards they're missing.</b>

14:41.870 --> 14:43.180
<b>Still dissatisfied?</b>

14:44.110 --> 14:45.810
<b>No, that's good enough.</b>

14:46.310 --> 14:49.030
<b>So tell us what their abilities are.</b>

14:49.030 --> 14:50.000
<b>What about you?</b>

14:50.830 --> 14:54.620
<b>Show us some proof you 
can be useful to us.</b>

14:54.620 --> 14:57.610
<b>We have seventy-one types 
of restricted slot cards...</b>

14:58.120 --> 15:00.100
<b>Significantly more than you.</b>

15:00.770 --> 15:05.130
<b>I'll give you an A-rank card in 
return for the information.</b>

15:05.610 --> 15:07.380
<b>You shouldn't have a problem with that.</b>

15:07.380 --> 15:08.870
<b>I have a problem.</b>

15:08.870 --> 15:11.390
<b>We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.</b>

15:12.130 --> 15:15.880
<b>So give us two S-rank cards or 
equally valuable information.</b>

15:15.880 --> 15:17.450
<b>Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing.</b>

15:17.450 --> 15:19.640
<b>Don't get too cocky, brat!</b>

15:20.050 --> 15:21.710
<b>Did you hear that, everyone?</b>

15:21.710 --> 15:23.410
<b>These kids won't be any help.</b>

15:23.800 --> 15:26.260
<b>They want two S-rank 
cards from each team.</b>

15:26.260 --> 15:28.030
<b>That's ten cards they'd take.</b>

15:28.210 --> 15:29.550
<b>Don't be a fool.</b>

15:29.550 --> 15:31.060
<b>I'm only taking cards from your team.</b>

15:31.060 --> 15:31.800
<b>Huh?</b>

15:32.560 --> 15:34.700
<b>I'm fine with giving information 
to the other four.</b>

15:35.200 --> 15:37.660
<b>I'll let them decide 
what to offer in return.</b>

15:37.940 --> 15:41.650
<b>But I won't tell you anything 
until you meet my condition.</b>

15:43.050 --> 15:44.780
<b>You are a stupid brat...</b>

15:44.780 --> 15:46.670
<b>Throwing a tantrum because 
I didn't baby you, huh?</b>

15:46.670 --> 15:48.600
<b>Stop this, both of you...</b>

15:48.600 --> 15:50.550
<b>We don't have time to 
fight amongst ourselves!</b>

15:50.790 --> 15:53.300
<b>I haven't agreed to 
team up with them yet!</b>

15:53.460 --> 15:55.130
<b>It's fine, Asta...</b>

15:55.130 --> 15:56.470
<b>Give them two cards.</b>

15:56.470 --> 15:58.310
<b>We need to move on.</b>

15:58.410 --> 15:59.490
<b>What?!</b>

15:59.490 --> 16:02.620
<b>I have no problem with 
giving them cards!</b>

16:02.620 --> 16:04.310
<b>But that kid's trying to pick a fight!</b>

16:04.680 --> 16:06.210
<b>You're the one picking a fight!</b>

16:06.650 --> 16:08.390
<b>Hey, let's leave.</b>

16:08.720 --> 16:10.590
<b>I don't want to team 
up with these people!</b>

16:10.590 --> 16:13.050
<b>Come, now... 
Though I admit I'm a bit peeved.</b>

16:13.050 --> 16:14.830
<b>But given the circumstances...</b>

16:18.790 --> 16:24.260
<b>Genthru has these two abilities, 
Countdown and Little Flower.</b>

16:24.610 --> 16:27.840
<b>So it's best to keep 
your distance from him.</b>

16:28.170 --> 16:30.340
<b>Seriously? He got me...</b>

16:30.340 --> 16:31.500
<b>Same here.</b>

16:31.500 --> 16:33.240
<b>He touched me when we 
were making a deal.</b>

16:33.240 --> 16:34.590
<b>Me, too...</b>

16:34.810 --> 16:37.760
<b>Sounds like a bunch of 
them might be victims.</b>

16:37.760 --> 16:38.720
<b><i>A chance!</i></b>

16:38.970 --> 16:41.410
<b>Isn't there any way to 
disable his technique?</b>

16:41.410 --> 16:42.900
<b>Yep, there is...</b>

16:42.900 --> 16:46.270
<b>You have to touch Genthru and say, 
"I caught the Bomber."</b>

16:46.580 --> 16:48.780
<b>Stupid! Why did you tell them?</b>

16:48.780 --> 16:51.120
<b>We could've gotten more 
cards out of them!</b>

16:51.120 --> 16:53.490
<b>That would have started another fight.</b>

16:54.160 --> 16:58.120
<b>The bombs can't be armed until Genthru 
explains how his ability works,</b>

16:58.120 --> 16:59.990
<b>so if you keep away from him,</b>

16:59.990 --> 17:01.660
<b>you should be safe.</b>

17:04.480 --> 17:08.000
<b>Did you know there are 
two ways to cast spells?</b>

17:08.330 --> 17:09.470
<b>Yep, I did.</b>

17:09.830 --> 17:14.130
<b>A spell card is used up the
 moment you say its name aloud.</b>

17:14.420 --> 17:16.760
<b>But it's possible to 
keep reusing a spell.</b>

17:16.760 --> 17:17.570
<b>Huh?</b>

17:18.490 --> 17:21.230
<b>For example, you know how a list</b>

17:21.230 --> 17:24.140
<b>of players you've met appears if 
you put Steal in your binder?</b>

17:24.450 --> 17:27.500
<b>If you remove the card without 
pressing the select button,</b>

17:28.050 --> 17:32.770
<b>the spell card isn't used up, 
so you can keep reusing it.</b>

17:33.110 --> 17:34.910
<b>I never tried that.</b>

17:34.910 --> 17:35.530
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:37.480 --> 17:40.660
<b>You can buy all B-rank 
restricted slot cards at stores.</b>

17:41.120 --> 17:44.480
<b>You simply need to buy from the 
same Trade Shop over fifty times.</b>

17:45.130 --> 17:48.590
<b>If you become a frequent customer, 
they'll start making you offers.</b>

17:49.990 --> 17:51.900
<b>Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?</b>

17:52.410 --> 17:55.040
<b>Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?</b>

17:56.990 --> 17:58.550
<b>Is that enough information</b>

17:58.910 --> 18:00.550
<b>to satisfy you?</b>

18:01.180 --> 18:03.400
<b>I'll give you another 
card if you're not happy.</b>

18:03.400 --> 18:05.500
<b>Nope, that's enough, thanks!</b>

18:05.500 --> 18:07.560
<b>I'm up next, then.</b>

18:08.290 --> 18:09.490
<b>I'm Goreinu.</b>

18:09.490 --> 18:10.560
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

18:13.000 --> 18:14.810
<b>Thanks, everyone!</b>

18:14.810 --> 18:16.530
<b>That was very educational.</b>

18:16.830 --> 18:20.030
<b>The question now is which card 
we should try to monopolize.</b>

18:20.500 --> 18:24.650
<b>It's probably impossible to 
monopolize the #75 we have.</b>

18:25.350 --> 18:29.210
<b>Each team can only obtain one, 
and the limit is twenty,</b>

18:29.620 --> 18:31.200
<b>which is too high.</b>

18:31.200 --> 18:33.320
<b>You obtained #75?</b>

18:33.320 --> 18:34.960
<b>That's impressive.</b>

18:35.230 --> 18:36.220
<b><i>List on!</i></b>

18:36.220 --> 18:37.700
<b>#75.</b>

18:38.470 --> 18:43.470
<b>Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite. 
Currently, 6 cards are in play.</b>

18:41.330 --> 18:43.470
<b>So five other teams each have one.</b>

18:43.830 --> 18:45.790
<b>Monopolizing this one 
will be impossible.</b>

18:45.790 --> 18:47.230
<b>What about the other two?</b>

18:47.230 --> 18:48.140
<b><i>List on!</i></b>

18:48.140 --> 18:48.910
<b>#9!</b>

18:49.350 --> 18:50.260
<b><i>List on.</i></b>

18:50.260 --> 18:51.240
<b>#2.</b>

18:51.950 --> 18:52.950
<b>No good.</b>

18:52.950 --> 18:55.180
<b>There are three teams with #9.</b>

18:55.460 --> 18:58.320
<b>No one has #2, Patch of Shore...</b>

18:59.190 --> 19:00.740
<b>We can make it work!</b>

19:01.030 --> 19:02.010
<b><i>Guide Post On.</i></b>

19:02.010 --> 19:02.780
<b>#2.</b>

19:04.050 --> 19:05.250
<b>I know where to find it...</b>

19:05.740 --> 19:06.750
<b>Soufrabi.</b>

19:06.750 --> 19:08.150
<b>I've been there before!</b>

19:08.150 --> 19:09.800
<b>I have an Accompany card here.</b>

19:09.800 --> 19:11.500
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

19:11.500 --> 19:12.620
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

19:12.620 --> 19:13.590
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

19:19.380 --> 19:21.260
<b>This is Soufrabi?</b>

19:21.260 --> 19:23.400
<b>It's a pretty big city...</b>

19:23.280 --> 19:27.270
<b>Soufrabi</b>

19:23.920 --> 19:25.740
<b>Let's head in and snoop around.</b>

19:29.960 --> 19:32.230
<b>Search every room, one by one.</b>

19:32.230 --> 19:34.400
<b>Some characters may not 
give you information</b>

19:34.400 --> 19:37.810
<b>until you visit multiple 
times, so pay attention.</b>

19:37.810 --> 19:38.970
<b>Okay!</b>

19:38.970 --> 19:39.900
<b>Hey!</b>

19:40.350 --> 19:42.550
<b>I found someone with information.</b>

19:42.550 --> 19:43.660
<b>Fast!</b>

19:46.790 --> 19:50.160
<b>The pirates rule this city...</b>

19:50.650 --> 19:52.690
<b>There's a legend about 
an underwater cavern</b>

19:52.690 --> 19:57.670
<b>called the Sea God's Grotto 
located somewhere in this area.</b>

19:58.610 --> 20:01.680
<b>Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.</b>

20:02.240 --> 20:07.520
<b>A few years ago, having heard of the 
legendary cavern and its treasure,</b>

20:07.520 --> 20:11.690
<b>fifteen pirates arrived in this city.</b>

20:12.950 --> 20:15.690
<b>Razor and the fourteen devils...</b>

20:16.210 --> 20:19.710
<b>The city fishermen were 
all tortured and killed.</b>

20:22.950 --> 20:26.490
<b>The pirates murdered anyone who 
knew about Patch of Shore.</b>

20:28.940 --> 20:32.990
<b>If you get rid of the pirates, 
I'll tell you what I know.</b>

20:35.130 --> 20:39.980
<b>When we visited a few months earlier, 
we couldn't find a single clue.</b>

20:40.660 --> 20:43.200
<b>This must be information only 
available at certain times.</b>

20:43.200 --> 20:45.840
<b>Maybe an event that only 
occurs at this time frame?</b>

20:46.840 --> 20:49.520
<b>Razor and the fourteen devils...</b>

20:50.130 --> 20:51.830
<b>It's possible that the event</b>

20:51.830 --> 20:54.210
<b>was triggered by the 
number of players here.</b>

20:54.210 --> 20:55.020
<b>Huh?</b>

20:55.310 --> 20:56.920
<b>There are fifteen pirates.</b>

20:56.920 --> 20:59.220
<b>And it just so happens that 
there are fifteen of us.</b>

20:59.850 --> 21:04.280
<b>So the event won't start until you 
have a party of fifteen or more?</b>

21:04.620 --> 21:07.760
<b>But how would a game 
character know that?</b>

21:07.760 --> 21:09.790
<b>Oh, Accompany!</b>

21:09.790 --> 21:14.180
<b>Yes, a group of fifteen or more must 
reach Soufrabi with Accompany.</b>

21:14.570 --> 21:17.420
<b>That's probably the 
trigger for this event.</b>

21:18.480 --> 21:19.880
<b>Brutal...</b>

21:19.880 --> 21:20.400
<b>Huh?</b>

21:20.400 --> 21:21.530
<b>Oh, nothing.</b>

21:23.310 --> 21:25.580
<b>Let's go to the pirate's base!</b>

21:39.360 --> 21:43.190
<b>Gon and his friends stand before 
some unpleasant looking pirates.</b>

21:43.640 --> 21:49.510
<b>Will the fifteen allies be able 
to obtain Patch of Shore?</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:08.300
<b>G.I. Tutorial</b>

23:01.840 --> 23:04.900
<b>Coming up, it's the 
Greed Island Tutorial!</b>

23:07.130 --> 23:10.100
<b>Today, we introduce the card 
Tax Collector's Gauntlet.</b>

23:08.280 --> 23:18.830
<b>Tax Collector's Gauntlet 

When equipped, player has 
the ability to cast Levy. But 
each cast will destroy a random 
card from player's restricted 
slots. (Cannot use Levy if 
restricted slots are empty.)</b>

23:10.210 --> 23:12.970
<b>If you turn this card into 
an item and equip it,</b>

23:12.970 --> 23:14.880
<b>you can steal random cards from others.</b>

23:14.880 --> 23:16.580
<b>And you can keep reusing it!</b>

23:17.660 --> 23:18.460
<b>Clunk.</b>

23:19.150 --> 23:20.970
<b>Continue!</b>

23:25.500 --> 23:27.960
<b>Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.</b>

23:29.680 --> 23:30.450
<b>Go!</b>

23:33.170 --> 23:34.050
<b>I can't say that!</b>
