WEBVTT

00:58.792 --> 01:01.260
We need to get
into a character,
okay?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.495
Slow down, my feet hurt.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.899
All right, Irene,
just remember
that we are Greek, okay?

01:06.901 --> 01:11.136
I'm going to do all
the talking, we have to
get into this party.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.838
Try and talk to somebody
important, all right.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.909
If I can get hired
for the Olympics
then "Hola Brazil".

01:16.911 --> 01:18.310
Brazil.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.451
Beautiful, yes.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.854
One more, nice.

01:31.257 --> 01:36.128
Hi, we should be
on the list. My name
is Theodora.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.496
And this is my sister Irene.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.099
We are the direct descendants
of the first Olympians.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.867
Nope.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.235
We really should be
on that list.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.138
You please check.
Every page.

01:52.879 --> 01:56.115
Wait until our ancestors
hear about this.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.684
I can't believe
that was your best idea.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.787
It's almost as ridiculous as
as when you pose as
that sports agent

02:01.789 --> 02:03.188
to meet that quarter guy.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.724
Okay, punter.
He was a punter,
thank you very much

02:05.726 --> 02:07.559
and he was very cute.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.697
Okay, what I remember is...
you showed up in the meeting
you couldn't come out of after.

02:11.699 --> 02:16.568
Well, you've to admit,
life is more fun
when you've got goals.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.537
It is goals.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.174
What are we gonna do now?

04:34.807 --> 04:38.910
<i>Do people from Brazil</i>
<i>desperately wanna travel</i>
<i>to New Jersey?</i>

04:42.515 --> 04:45.284
<i>I thought college
would help me escape</i>

04:45.286 --> 04:46.752
<i>but it failed.</i>

04:47.854 --> 04:53.825
I'm right back where I started,
plain and small.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.201
Credit cards.

05:03.203 --> 05:07.773
No, you are not going into debt
just so you can chase poison
in the Southern Hemisphere.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.809
Please Mom! It could be
a culturally immersive
experience.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.478
-It could change my life.
-I don't think immersive
is a word.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.915
Yes, it is. And what can be more
worse than bad credit, you know?

05:16.917 --> 05:22.220
I think it's about time
that I become less local
and more global.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.756
I'll tell you
what is more worth.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.926
Is you getting your life
going towards
a worthwhile goal.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.494
Don't waste time!

05:31.497 --> 05:36.468
Honey, we need to save
very penny for law school.

05:36.470 --> 05:40.272
-And besides its best for you
to stay in school until...
-The economy gets better, great.

05:40.274 --> 05:44.376
Precisely. Everyone I know
from college is going
abroad after graduating moment.

05:44.378 --> 05:47.746
- What do you do?
- It's plans with money, Dora.

05:47.748 --> 05:52.250
You need to expand your
social circle or network
or whatever you call it.

05:52.252 --> 05:56.121
But Irene and I've been friends
since we've lived
in the city, Mom.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.924
How about something sweet?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.744
Or run away.
I'll go to Ohio

06:18.746 --> 06:21.246
Or go to Nevada
or go to Singapore.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.850
But then I've to be a stowaway
on that ship
and that'd be really weird.

06:24.852 --> 06:28.153
But then I'll make
a living from my...

06:28.155 --> 06:32.023
something, but then I'll become
famous and then she'll be sorry.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.694
And I'll be set
to do something big.

06:35.696 --> 06:39.498
And she'll show up
and I won't recognize her.

06:39.500 --> 06:44.035
Right? And then I'll turn around
and say, "Mom? what mom?

06:44.037 --> 06:47.873
I don't know what this woman
is talking about,
please take her away."

06:49.976 --> 06:51.843
- Dora?
- What?

06:53.212 --> 06:56.114
You've gotta snap out of this.

06:56.116 --> 07:00.719
Yeah, so says the girl about
to leave for South America.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.421
I'm sorry to interrupt
Miss Huntington,

07:02.423 --> 07:05.891
it's getting late if we're
gonna be picking up
your friend.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.659
Bri is meeting me
at the airport.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.098
Brianna is going with you?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.733
I couldn't go alone.

07:15.635 --> 07:18.170
No, no, I guess, you couldn't.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.143
All right.
You're gonna be late.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.882
- I love you.
- I love you. Have fun.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.197
Honey?

07:48.701 --> 07:52.070
We can go to the shore
every weekend
when the weather warms up.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.942
Can you sign this "Get Well"
card for your Aunt Vera, please?

08:39.418 --> 08:41.919
-Would you like to know
what happened to her?
-Yeah, what happened?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.221
She broke her foot.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.590
She was dancing.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.795
God bless her.

08:50.797 --> 08:55.066
Oh, my, Aunt Vera
is bringing it down.
It's kinda cool.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.869
Yeah, I guess so,
except that at her age
a broken bone

08:57.871 --> 09:00.939
is going to take an awful
lot longer to heal.

09:00.941 --> 09:05.844
Oh, gosh and there's
that book <i>Paradise</i>
<i>that just came out.</i>

09:05.846 --> 09:09.247
-What kinda book?
-Oh, it's Nena Gabrelle's
autobiography,

09:09.249 --> 09:11.783
now it's on best seller list.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.654
Nena Gabrelle
who is the... actress?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.790
No, Nena Gabrelle, the bimbo.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.892
Oh, God,
you don't know
about this.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.763
So, wait. Turns out
that uncle Theodore

09:24.765 --> 09:28.733
faked his death and ran off
with her back in the 60's.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.669
What?

09:30.671 --> 09:33.104
- No way, that's crazy.
- Right.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.576
Oh, my God, your room,
have you seen your room?

09:38.444 --> 09:40.111
Ta-da!

09:41.981 --> 09:44.149
You signed up
for the prep
course thing, right?

09:47.820 --> 09:51.790
-You did not just clap
your hands at me, Mom.
-Yes, I did, Dora,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.558
I'm trying to energize you.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.928
Let's go Dora,
come on you can do it.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.565
This depressions of yours really
get in the way of your progress.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.367
Stop, stop.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.672
I'm just trying
to support you, honey.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.975
We'll miss together, you know?

10:14.714 --> 10:19.117
Real fab, wish you're here
instead of Bri.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.854
Did Irene even graduate?
I thought she flunked out.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.025
You can let go off me now.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.727
Okay.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.773
Is Aunt Vera have anyone
taking care of her?

10:41.775 --> 10:44.743
No, not yet, she doesn't like
to have strangers in her house.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.465
So they're still trying out
to find someone.

10:50.116 --> 10:53.752
No, no, no, no, no.
Have you lost your mind?

10:53.754 --> 10:56.321
- Please don't clap at me again.
- No.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.425
You cannot take care of
any old woman, right now.
Dora, no.

11:00.427 --> 11:04.663
-That's final.
-I owe her, it's the least
I can do.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.766
I'll go look into
the train schedules.

11:09.268 --> 11:13.838
Yes, you do that.
Because I'll damned
if I am going to drive you.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.276
This is silly, I'll drive you.

11:18.278 --> 11:22.247
The cleaning lady says that
she needs help in and out
of the bath tub.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.049
No problem, there.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.318
She likes music but no cd's,
only record albums.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.991
Hey, is this Grandma's coat?

11:32.993 --> 11:39.297
Well, I thought, I play the part
of the dowdy poor relation.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.633
Like the Gothic novel.

11:41.635 --> 11:46.104
The eve of departure is
upon me yet?

11:46.106 --> 11:49.641
I must journey to
Great Aunt Vera's country manor.

11:49.643 --> 11:53.778
Except that it's Brooks brothers
and very expensive.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.948
Why don't you play the part
of a bright young girl

11:56.950 --> 11:59.818
who aspires to become
a successful lawyer.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.353
Hmm?

12:02.355 --> 12:09.127
Okay. Most importantly,
keep her spirits up,
she likes her cocktails.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.731
But you've to ask her
if she wants one,
she won't make it herself.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.067
And cut her toe nails.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.569
That's gross.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.271
- That's gross.
- That's the job.

12:21.741 --> 12:29.414
Why does it always seem
like everything fabulous
is so far away from me.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.517
And I think,
it's all right there
in your head.

12:32.519 --> 12:36.020
<i>Ladies</i>
<i>and Gentlemen,</i>
<i>an important announcement...</i>

12:40.292 --> 12:43.428
I'll be up on March, 1st
to take you to the test

12:43.430 --> 12:48.266
and I'll come and get you
whenever you want, okay?
All you have to do is call me.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.342
You're arrested for murder...

14:20.559 --> 14:22.160
Aunt Vera?

14:25.431 --> 14:26.564
Hello?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.503
<i>You can feel
the end of your terror...</i>

14:45.117 --> 14:46.618
Aunt Vera?

14:47.319 --> 14:49.354
Good afternoon, Dora.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.055
You can turn that off.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.201
Do you want some help?

15:05.204 --> 15:11.209
I'm cold, I wanted a fire.
And I've always hated
this chair.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.414
Here.

15:19.585 --> 15:24.923
All right, all right,
all right,
just a moment, yeah.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.627
- Hold on, hold on, I...
- Yeah.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.337
I can walk.
I'm not a invalid.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.640
So, please,
do not treat me like one.

15:43.809 --> 15:47.345
If you want to be useful...

15:47.347 --> 15:52.050
you can bring-in that poor
resina plant out there.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.618
Bring her inside.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.360
Don't leave the door open,
please hurry.

16:02.362 --> 16:06.631
I don't
think, this is fire wood yet,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.666
but I can try to
use your hammer.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.502
No, Dora, it will come back.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.272
And then we'll put it in the sun
where it belongs.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.313
Machine picks it up.

16:26.852 --> 16:30.088
Can I...
can make you a cup of tea?

16:32.558 --> 16:33.658
No, tea.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.398
No... tea.

16:45.237 --> 16:49.340
-Aunt Vera, would you
like a drink?
-Martini dry with a twist.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.642
Yes, ma'am.
Cocktail comin' up.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.755
I-I love your home.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.492
Does it have a name?

17:07.493 --> 17:11.796
I've never understood,
how you can name a house?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.531
Unless houses come
when you call them.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.738
My grandfather built it.

17:22.674 --> 17:27.412
When he died,
my family moved here
from Charleston.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.249
It was quite a cultural shock.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.421
I guess, this is where I'll die.

17:40.125 --> 17:44.562
So, you've come
to help your feeble aunt.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.764
Great Aunt.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.234
You can't be happy about it.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.103
Oh, I've volunteered.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.206
You need your head examined.

18:57.402 --> 19:02.240
Hi! Hi, yes, yeah,
everything is fine.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.910
I love Aunt Vera.

19:05.912 --> 19:11.115
What a... warm and gentle soul.

19:11.117 --> 19:15.153
Yeah, I think, I think,
this is going to be the best
thing I've ever did.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.225
Yes, I'm been serious, Mom.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.928
Yeah.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.098
Okay, okay, I gotta go.

19:27.100 --> 19:32.803
Yes, there's a desk with a chair
and my computer on it, okay?
Goodbye, Mom.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.860
I graduated college.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.863
So I heard.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.767
What degree?

20:02.769 --> 20:05.503
Pre-Law and a minor
in English Literature.

20:06.638 --> 20:11.676
Here is to your wonderfully
useless degrees.

20:12.911 --> 20:16.847
-Which you paid for
and I'm forever thankful.
-Hmm-mm.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.650
And I just turned 20.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.720
And to being 20.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.523
And all that it means.

20:26.558 --> 20:31.128
-Oh, it should meant,
take a travel.
-Oh, hmm.

20:31.130 --> 20:35.633
When I traveled continually
for years.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.536
Now...

20:38.538 --> 20:42.540
I've a garden
and it takes up my time.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.377
-I'm sure, it's beautiful
on the Spring.
-Hmm?

20:46.379 --> 20:50.014
It's beautiful, now.
It's just dormant.

20:55.821 --> 20:59.523
And I hear you still dancing.
That's amazing.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.493
- Where do you dance?
- Dance?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.528
I heard you broke
your foot dancing.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.265
I broke my toe, not my foot.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.236
Just my toe.
But through me off-balance,
a great deal

21:12.238 --> 21:14.739
because the damn thing
is just like an anchor.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.808
And I can't drive.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.379
Oh, no, I can't even go,
up and down stairs.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.882
And, they moved me
down into the study.

21:26.385 --> 21:29.720
Well, you could
always learn to...

21:30.222 --> 21:31.822
chair dance.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.330
Now I see your father.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.933
He died too young.

21:45.671 --> 21:49.607
It's strange to think,
I spent half my life
without him already.

21:51.009 --> 21:54.779
I was your age when I met Theo.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.817
Wasn't he some sort of, like,
war journalist, right?

22:00.085 --> 22:01.819
Oh, honey.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.488
He was the best.

22:05.457 --> 22:09.226
We met when he was here
in Saugerties.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.362
Well, he's still paying his dues

22:11.364 --> 22:14.699
and he was covering a story
with cement factory.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.335
And when he left...

22:18.403 --> 22:20.104
I've followed him.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.542
That's romantic.

-Yeah.

What? You must be really cool

37:35.787 --> 37:38.888
It's depending on her mood.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.258
You know.
But I found her journal's

37:41.260 --> 37:43.827
from like really, really
long time ago.

37:43.829 --> 37:44.995
- No way.
- Yeah.

37:44.997 --> 37:48.498
-What do they say?
-It's wild
and you'd never know it,

37:48.500 --> 37:50.967
but she used to do this thing
called tramping.

37:50.969 --> 37:55.305
So, Aunt Vera and uncle Theo
they'd jump
on a moving train cars

37:55.307 --> 37:56.673
and that's how they traveled.

37:56.675 --> 38:01.778
- Like a hobo?
- Like, like, romantic hobos.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.415
Oh, did you find out getting

38:06.050 --> 38:09.052
- Closed

Good afternoon.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.436
I'm Aunt Vera's niece.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.372
And I love poetry.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.542
Sounds like an A.A. meeting.

38:33.345 --> 38:34.644
Sorry.

38:38.115 --> 38:40.483
In the room, women come and go,

38:40.985 --> 38:42.986
talking of Michelangelo.

38:45.956 --> 38:49.626
Yes, thank you, Dora.
It's so nice of your aunt

38:49.628 --> 38:52.629
to offer her home
to the poetry
up.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.532
Guy Reid, can you please
take this away?

39:00.504 --> 39:04.541
Okay, before I begin,
I just want to remind everybody

39:04.543 --> 39:07.744
the end of Winter Poetry
Festival is coming up very soon.

39:07.746 --> 39:11.047
We sell posters and tickets
so we really need to
get the word out.

39:12.383 --> 39:15.452
The other night I was
in the fast food parking lot,

39:16.320 --> 39:18.555
trying to decide
whether to turn left

39:18.557 --> 39:22.859
and go out into the night
or to turn right and drive home.

39:22.861 --> 39:28.064
I was wanting to satisfy
a deep longing for beauty.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.702
But I realized that satisfaction
of that longing is not possible.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.439
Art is the best chance
we have of finding truth.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.508
And therefore being beautiful.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.143
If the muse allows.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.147
So I wrote this poem.

So, no, you're not
like your dad.

55:09.806 --> 55:11.840
He was in the theater.

55:11.842 --> 55:15.311
When you came,
your mother wanted him to quit.

55:16.479 --> 55:20.549
I do know that he loved you
and your mom very much.

55:22.552 --> 55:24.420
She never talks about him.

55:33.096 --> 55:34.763
I think,
I will go in the village.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.435
If you need anything
just call me.

55:39.903 --> 55:41.870
I won't need you.

55:43.473 --> 55:45.174
But you do need me Aunt Vera

55:45.176 --> 55:49.378
because you have a broken toe
and I cannot wait
for it to be unbroken.

55:57.153 --> 55:58.921
I told you.

55:58.923 --> 56:03.625
I'm a pauper, I hold a big bag
of clothes I can't even afford.

56:10.066 --> 56:11.600
♪

56:21.711 --> 56:22.911
Abbey.

56:24.147 --> 56:25.714
I'm busy.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.584
I'm just returning the clothes.

56:29.886 --> 56:31.320
I didn't eat in them.

56:31.322 --> 56:34.857
Except when I ate my foot
at the music studio.

56:42.899 --> 56:44.733
Prosecco.

56:45.969 --> 56:48.637
Is that how you normally are?

56:48.639 --> 56:50.806
I mean, I admittedly
I don't know you that well

56:50.808 --> 56:54.009
but you got this weird look
in your face as if...

56:54.511 --> 56:56.412
nothing else mattered.

56:56.980 --> 56:59.515
You completely shut me down.

57:00.116 --> 57:02.117
- It was awful.
- I know, I know.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.986
I think it's my nerves.

57:03.988 --> 57:08.791
Um, my mom calls it,
"Leaving the planet."

57:09.659 --> 57:12.227
Yeah, I didn't mean
to do it at all.

57:12.229 --> 57:14.463
I'm, I'm so sorry.

57:16.466 --> 57:18.467
What's that about?

57:18.469 --> 57:21.036
Wow, I had a great idea.

57:21.038 --> 57:24.506
I think you should sing
at the Poetry Festival.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.875
That's a big event.

57:26.877 --> 57:28.710
You've got already
burnt me voice.

57:28.712 --> 57:32.347
Yeah, I know and that's,
that's once too many.

57:32.349 --> 57:37.886
Apparently, I'm in drastic need
of some emotional stylization
too.

57:43.393 --> 57:45.494
Cut that baby open.

57:45.995 --> 57:47.729
I need it.

57:48.364 --> 57:50.599
Why, what's going on?

57:50.601 --> 57:54.837
Oh, Dora, this is
the beginning
of the end.

57:54.839 --> 57:56.705
- It is?
- Yes.

57:56.707 --> 58:02.744
This is the first day
of the last 30 days
of my twenties.

58:04.414 --> 58:06.615
Oh, my God.

58:06.617 --> 58:10.352
I'm getting older, darling.

58:10.354 --> 58:12.654
- Shut up.
- Yes.

58:12.656 --> 58:15.824
I see like I'm just getting
wrinkly all over.

58:30.640 --> 58:32.508
Let's get out of here.

58:33.776 --> 58:36.979
And go where?
There's no where to go.

58:38.348 --> 58:41.950
Doesn't Saugerties have a...
lighthouse?

58:41.952 --> 58:45.854
Yeah, but it's like
way too cold
and windy.

58:49.893 --> 58:53.462
Oh, I know, you should like...

58:53.464 --> 58:55.697
we should go out there
and you should do some like

58:55.699 --> 58:58.267
performance out there
in honor of turning thirty.

58:58.269 --> 58:59.668
Like what?

59:05.508 --> 59:08.644
It's totally uncivilized
out here.

59:08.646 --> 59:10.946
This is awesome!

59:10.948 --> 59:13.448
- Be careful.
- Oh, my God.

59:13.450 --> 59:16.652
Okay, start picking up things
that we can like throw
into the river.

59:16.654 --> 59:18.220
It will just blow away.

59:18.222 --> 59:22.324
So, what, ? Just think of it is
like your life up until now

59:22.326 --> 59:23.392
And just blow them away.

59:23.394 --> 59:25.127
This is really depressing.

59:27.764 --> 59:30.132
Getting old is depressing.

59:30.767 --> 59:33.769
Let's go.

59:34.370 --> 59:36.004
Come on, you old, maid.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.113
Get more sticks.

59:47.250 --> 59:52.054
It's so pretty out here.

59:52.056 --> 59:55.223
It's such a cold day
to come out here.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.528
- Whoa!
- It's the light house.

59:59.530 --> 01:00:01.730
This is so cool.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.174
Ready?

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.855
Farewell old days.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:30.792
Here's to better new ways.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:37.232
You're like a hawk, perched,
ready to devour.

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:42.604
The Earth, the world, my heart
and all it's power.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:46.708
Thank you wind for listening.

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:50.012
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:54.883
Oh, that train is headed
to the city.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.886
- I wish we were on it.
- I know.

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:01.923
Sometimes, I wish, I could
get on the through-way

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:04.860
drive south and never come back.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.897
- Do it.
- I can't.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.833
I have to take care
of my step sister Tabatha...

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.402
Right here.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:22.444
- Oh, what a cutie.
- Yes, she is cute.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.146
- And she is smart too.
- Yeah.

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:28.684
Her parents, my dad
and his on-off, on-off,
girlfriend,

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:31.787
they don't make the time
to take care of her.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.555
Oh, that's awful.

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:36.725
Yes. So, otherwise,
I would be gone...

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.794
long time ago.

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:42.397
But you've your music, Abbey,
that's amazing, I mean,

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.267
I don't have anything except...

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:52.040
thoughts about being far away
and doing huge things.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:58.180
-Hmm.
-But, but how do I get
from here to there.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:01.416
You know, like I feel like
I'm in this...

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:05.187
this old beige waiting room.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:06.521
Don't worry.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.890
Somewhere deal
will creep up on you

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:12.027
and it might not be huge
but it fill massive.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:15.230
And the beige waiting room
will just be a memory.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.941
Hey, is that Nikki?

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.743
Nikki?

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.013
Whoa.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.182
What you doing here?

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.684
This is so weird.

01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:37.285
Hey, well,
what are you doing here?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.388
We just made a sacrifice.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.591
Sacrifice?

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.826
What kind of sacrifice?

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:47.095
It is in honor
of Abbey's birthday.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.265
She's little upset
that she's turning 30.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.833
I mean, she's upset
because of, um,

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.301
because of something else.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.570
Thirty?

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.639
Oh, you poor little thing, you.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:01.076
In that case, you might just
throw yourself in the river
and get over with it.

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:05.480
Thirty, believe me,
it doesn't matter.

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.284
Least until you get
to be my age anyway.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:14.589
For instance, I just,
I just finished this record.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:17.025
- Everybody says it's great.
- Great.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:20.362
No, but see,
great is over rated.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.798
You know what I mean?

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.333
Really, where's the life in it,
you know.

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:30.005
I can't think the last time
that I made a record

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:33.708
that had a track on it.
They had to...
grow on the listener.

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:38.647
When you listen to a new thing,
something's not right,
but then you listen to it again.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.248
And again and again.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:44.119
And slowly but surely it grabs
and throws you in river.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.455
Now the Buddhists...

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:51.326
Now Buddhists, the Buddhists
have a saying that,

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:55.130
whatever you do
up until the age of 50,

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:59.201
stop it and do something
completely different.

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:05.440
Me, I'm little late on that one
myself but...

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:09.010
But I thought you said
that age doesn't matter.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.313
It's true.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.748
I'm talking about the work
though, I mean,
if you're not sweat

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:20.555
and working hard at something
then you're just not... living.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:32.434
On that note,
it's time for this one to go.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:36.905
- To go home.
- Oh, oh, Nikki, Nikki

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.240
I'm all right.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.349
Hi, Aunt Vera.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.652
Went to the lighthouse.

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.228
Vera?

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.436
Vera?

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.312
Vera?

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.684
Aunt, Aunt Vera?

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.057
Are you all right?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.028
How long you've been out here?

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.997
I heard the train.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.102
This is nothing like it.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:49.044
Did you give him
the letters too?

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.212
Well, mostly...

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.248
scribbled thoughts.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.985
That's when Theo did
when he was gone.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.657
Once annually burned them.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.594
What's the use?

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.431
I know 'em all by heart.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.134
Particularly one.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:18.640
"Dear Virginia.
How are you?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.645
I can't continue.

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:30.185
And all the places
they would know, the people...

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:34.456
the deadlines.

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.492
Grab my hand.

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.128
Like we used to.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.997
Jumping trains.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:45.500
And now, I'll pull you up.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:50.405
And we'll escape together."

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.578
I don't have that letter.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.285
Because Theo never wrote it.

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.400
You wanna travel, Dora.

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:21.236
I'll give you the money.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:26.074
Okay, great.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.476
Because I don't want you
here anymore.

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:40.755
Degraw is interested
in my journals.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:49.164
I wanted you to have
the spotlight, not...

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.732
what's your name.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:57.772
What feeble half big brain,
do you posses?

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:00.308
This says it's okay for you...

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.145
to just serve up
my private moments on a platter

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.281
to some complete stranger.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.394
You gave him the originals.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:23.531
For God Sake,
not even photo copies!

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:27.868
Oh, God.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.256
♪

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.158
Bye, Aunt Vera.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.263
<i>I know it was stupid, Mom.</i>

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.932
My bus gets in at two.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.737
The test, what about the test?

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:40.642
Yeah, I'll take it in Newark.
Bye.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.862
Please, get in, Dora.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:12.507
Oh, my God,
I'm feeling so sorry,

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.943
like the way I treated you,
it was just no consideration

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:18.746
for the other person.
I'm turning
into my mom. I mean...

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.716
Oh, God, there's
no respect for you or anything

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:26.554
and I'm so sorry, I'll call
The Graw and I'm sorry.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.225
Why do you have a trash can?

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.293
What are these?

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.563
Nothing, just...

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.066
trash.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:39.767
What is they used to be?

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.138
Some are, um...
images from my dreams

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:49.744
and others are just thoughts...
it's junk, it's nothing,
it's just throw aways.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:56.618
Well, they may be a bit rough
but they are telling.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.355
A place where interesting
things occur.

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:01.956
You know, my poetry club?

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.558
Oh, no, I can't read these.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.059
Oh, not the way
they are right now,

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.461
but you can work them.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.696
And read it at the festival.

No. A poem...

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:03.878
Anyway I'm just trying

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.681
I'm not as insensitive
as you think I am.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.849
And when you're making
six figures,

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:12.420
you can donate your time
and money to
a local poet's group.

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:14.121
Isn't that right?

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:18.092
Well, if...
That's the path

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:19.160
Well, it should be.

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.796
I mean, look at you and me.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:24.398
Where did purview,
where did our heart
take our fears, huh?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.868
Down under the pit,
where it aches.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.805
Seldom comes up for air.

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.940
Well, I can't argue with that.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.876
So, put off pleasure
for a while,

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.746
knowing that all down the line,
it's gonna rear it's...

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:43.517
Lil' luxurious
and lucrative head.

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:47.421
-Job, money, life,
that's the order, Mom?
-That's right.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.228
Is that what you told dad?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.936
- Can I have one of those?
- Oh, yes, dear.

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:09.310
I mean, where's the glamor
in starving?

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.883
I guess, it's makes you skinny
and that's fashionable.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:20.154
And okay,
we were passionate
and starving.

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.990
But then, you came and...

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:25.526
everything changes.

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:27.828
Everything.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.031
So...

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.735
So, dad's career wasn't
good enough for you.

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:37.071
Your parents
had the same career.

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:42.143
Hot glue and lumber,
God, I miss that smell.

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.980
For constructing sets.

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:49.617
But... but getting a real job
and moving to Jersey

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:53.988
that must've stressed dad out
and probably contributed
to his heart attack.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:57.625
Your father didn't die
from a heart attack, Dora.

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.127
He fell off a scaffold
and died instantly.

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:04.498
What?

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.371
I wasn't' there.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.775
Before I left.

01:20:14.777 --> 01:20:17.478
Danny was going on and on
about this.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.248
Unusual and extravagant set.

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.985
Why did I leave, right?

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:28.088
I can't remember all,
so foggy now.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:31.458
But I came back and I...

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.460
I couldn't see him.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:36.130
In the first I thought it was
because of the...

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.232
my eyes.

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:40.067
Going from sunlight
into darkness

01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:41.869
it's always hard adjusting.

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.272
So, I want a...

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:50.010
beside I were like... kept,
trying to find him up there.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.048
And then I knew...

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:59.119
He was on the floor, he was...

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.026
No way...

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.096
I was going to tell that
to my lil' girl.

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:16.437
Heart attack, heart attack,
heart attack,

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:21.909
that was it.
End of story.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.831

You nervous?

Everybody gets nervous.

You never hear
that Janis Joplin threw up
before every performance?

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:15.736
All right, so that something
to do with the amount of whiskey
she drank, but...

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:19.006
Nevertheless,
remember what I was telling you
at the river.

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:21.341
At least trying to tell you
down by the river.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.744
I want to you take
that one energy

01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:26.480
that's inside you
that needs to come out.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:28.916
And throw it at the audience.

01:26:28.918 --> 01:26:31.118
Be a thunderbolt with words.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.720
Make a collision
between you and them.

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:38.492
Or... you could bail.

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:47.634
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:49.970
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:53.740
<i>This poem is called
Frozen Garden.</i>

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:56.910
<i>And it is dedicated
to my Aunt Vera.</i>

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:03.917
<i>"Nature is sometimes cruel
to the seeds we cast.</i>

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:08.589
<i>But some seeds pick up
the wind and warm.</i>

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.960
<i>Dad.</i>

01:27:12.962 --> 01:27:17.431
<i>I see you smiling</i>
<i>atop this structure</i>
<i>of your happiness.</i>

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:20.267
<i>Painting the future
of your dreams...</i>

01:27:20.269 --> 01:27:21.935
<i>you left behind.</i>

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:26.073
<i>I'm here now, step by step,</i>

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:29.509
<i>moving on the set,
you helped create.</i>

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:32.646
<i>I want to sing my song.
Loud and Proud.</i>

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:36.283
<i>But my brain makes the tune
of fog muddle.</i>

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:40.854
<i>The heart is my mostly
companion,</i>

01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:44.958
<i>traveling along a path
not weeded with ease.</i>

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.428
<i>Beats on as it quivers.</i>

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.931
<i>It's vocals sometimes faint.</i>

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:56.236
<i>I was only ten
when you took a misstep</i>

01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:58.505
<i>and didn't understand
why you left.</i>

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.275
<i>Where...</i>

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.977
<i>your heart did not attack.</i>

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:06.913
<i>And I don't see you falling.</i>

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.851
<i>I see you finally able to fly.</i>

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.522
<i>You were brave, Dad.</i>

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.325
<i>And I'll be too.</i>

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:20.894
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:33.240
<i>Well, I wasn't</i>
<i>exactly a thunderbolt</i>
<i>with words.</i>

01:28:33.242 --> 01:28:37.711
But I'm struck
by two extraordinary thoughts.

01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:41.882
<i>Everything fabulous...
is not so far away from me.</i>

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:47.954
And I understand why my mom
wants me to go to law school.

01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:50.324
