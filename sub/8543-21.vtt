WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:06.006
[instrumental music]

00:08.356 --> 00:10.097
[knock on door]

00:13.187 --> 00:14.405
[knocking continues]

00:14.492 --> 00:15.711
I'm busy!

00:15.798 --> 00:17.017
[Teresa]
'Duty calls.'

00:21.891 --> 00:24.763
'I've been trying to get you
on the phone. Open the door.'

00:27.027 --> 00:29.681
[intense music]

00:36.471 --> 00:38.299
Does that board have you
any closer to catching Red John?

00:38.386 --> 00:40.170
I don't know.
I keep getting interrupted.

00:40.257 --> 00:43.434
What I need is radio silence,
Lisbon, for a week. If you can.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.610
The dead body at LaRoche's house
won't wait that long.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.221
J.J.'s?

00:47.308 --> 00:49.092
He asked for you
specifically on the case.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.965
[music continues]

00:57.187 --> 00:59.711
[indistinct chattering]

01:02.758 --> 01:04.412
[Wayne]
'Hey, boss.'

01:04.499 --> 01:06.892
So LaRoche came home early
on a red eye from New York.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.633
He saw the flashlights
and surprised

01:08.720 --> 01:10.505
two robbers breaking
into the safe.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.115
That's when
the shooting started.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.422
- Where's the other one?
- Escaped out the back.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.207
They wore masks. It was dark.
LaRoche didn't see much.

01:17.294 --> 01:21.037
Oh, they hit the hummels.
Is LaRoche okay?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.647
[Wayne]
'He sustained a minor hit.'

01:22.734 --> 01:24.475
[Teresa]
'Anything missing
from the safe?'

01:24.562 --> 01:27.130
[Wayne]
Nope. He stopped them
before they could take anything.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.351
You know, we can have
someone handle the dog.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.440
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.616
There's no ID
on the body.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.270
Well, maybe not
government issue

01:36.357 --> 01:38.750
but there's a lot
of information here.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.405
Like these black spots
on his fingertips.

01:41.492 --> 01:42.711
Dead tissue.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.064
And his eyes are very
inflamed, too.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.110
- Maybe he was on drugs.
- Just..

01:51.807 --> 01:53.896
[pills rattle]

01:53.983 --> 01:56.768
Nice one, Lisbon.
Ibuprofen.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.510
I'm gonna guess this man
was suffering

01:59.597 --> 02:01.425
from rheumatoid arthritis.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.079
Well, if you're gonna
get in a gunfight

02:03.166 --> 02:05.037
it's best to get in one
with an arthritic shooter.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.431
Mm. Where is LaRoche?

02:07.518 --> 02:09.085
He's waiting in the ambulance.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.826
He won't let the paramedics
take him for treatment

02:10.913 --> 02:12.871
until he talks to you.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.743
Oh. Well, excuse me.

02:14.830 --> 02:15.961
VIP.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.488
[gasps]

02:23.055 --> 02:24.448
J.J..

02:26.363 --> 02:27.843
I see you bought
a new safe.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.714
Apparently it's not
safe enough.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.326
- Excuse us, please.
- 'Yes, sir.'

02:32.413 --> 02:35.024
I'm gonna cut to the chase,
Mr. Jane.

02:35.111 --> 02:38.114
I was not forthcoming
with Rigsby.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.811
They took something.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.900
My Tupperware box.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.598
Yeah, I figured.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.253
Been hiding that box
for nine years.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.995
I thought you were the only one
that knew of its existence.

02:50.082 --> 02:54.304
But after the gunfire ended,
the box was missing

02:54.391 --> 02:56.698
and this was in its place.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.135
"Drop the case.
You have until tonight."

02:59.222 --> 03:00.484
[breathing heavily]

03:00.571 --> 03:02.660
What case?

03:02.747 --> 03:05.794
I'm investigating
a security leak inside CBI.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.666
The leak will turn
the tupperware

03:08.753 --> 03:12.496
over to authorities
if I don't back off.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.718
You know what'll happen
if they unseal that box.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.894
I do.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.983
Of course youdo.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.898
I didn't take it.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.682
I know that, Patrick.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.685
It's your favorite
blackmail device.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.994
Your puppet mastery
over me ends if

03:32.081 --> 03:33.909
its contents becomes
public knowledge.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.261
I never thought of you
as a puppet.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.784
You ever thought of me
as a friend?

03:43.005 --> 03:44.485
This is difficult to ask.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.008
[sighs]

03:49.229 --> 03:50.752
I need your help.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.060
Please.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.367
Sure. I, I'll find
your tupperware.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.285
I would appreciate that.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.288
As would my mother.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.250
You can take me now.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.950
[intense music]

04:19.520 --> 04:21.565
[engine starts]

04:24.002 --> 04:25.917
So what's
in the tupperware box?

04:31.183 --> 04:32.489
I don't know.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.496
[theme music]

04:47.330 --> 04:49.376
Two years ago,
I hired a petty thief

04:49.463 --> 04:51.291
to break into LaRoche's safe

04:51.378 --> 04:52.944
for a list
of Red John suspects.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.772
Yeah, I know.
I had to slug the guy

04:54.859 --> 04:57.122
in front of his lawyer
to keep you out of jail.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.907
Cost me six months
in anger management.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.691
Yeah, and I hope
you learned something.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.478
My point is..

05:04.565 --> 05:06.262
...he opened the safe

05:06.349 --> 05:07.698
and he saw
a tupperware box.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.701
Which was stolen
this morning.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.530
To blackmail Laroche
into dropping his investigation.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.227
What investigation?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
Well, apparently there's
a security leak inside the CBI.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.884
Well, maybe
your thief took it.

05:19.971 --> 05:23.018
No, LaRoche's new safe
is way out of his league.

05:23.105 --> 05:26.108
In any case,
the missing plastic ware

05:26.195 --> 05:28.545
has the power to end
LaRoche's career.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.242
And you really don't
know what's inside?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.070
[chuckles]
No, I, I don't.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.637
But LaRoche
doesn't know that.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.465
So while I'm busy with him,
why don't you assign

05:35.552 --> 05:37.772
Rigsby and Van Pelt
to find out what's in the box?

05:37.859 --> 05:40.601
Our job is to catch
the criminal who got away

05:40.688 --> 05:43.386
not protect some CBI agent
who might be dirty.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.519
So much for
the anger management training.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.044
[sighs]

05:49.131 --> 05:51.351
If we can solve the mystery
of LaRoche's secret

05:51.438 --> 05:54.092
it will lead us
to the missing criminal.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.660
Why don't you just ask
LaRoche what's in the box?

05:56.747 --> 05:59.054
He's not gonna
tell me voluntarily.

05:59.141 --> 06:02.187
It's embarrassing to him
and deeply personal.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.841
- And it's in tupperware?
- Yes.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.367
How could you not
want to investigate?

06:08.933 --> 06:11.327
LaRoche told Jane he had
the box for nine years.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.503
Dig into his past.
Look for significant events.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.939
And check out his mother.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.854
LaRoche made a strange
reference to her.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.290
Oh, the Tupperware's a clue.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.857
Why hide something
in tupperware?

06:19.944 --> 06:22.033
I don't know.
Keep it fresh?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.774
Nothing stays fresh
for nine years.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.821
Well, maybe LaRoche needed a box
and the tupperware was handy.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.953
No. Tupperware's never handy.
It's always in the wrong drawer.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.564
And when you do find it,
the lid's always missing.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.479
- Right? I hate that.
- Yeah.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.437
Uh, don't let LaRoche know
you have knowledge of the box.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.613
That's a confidence
between he and Jane.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.703
We got a hit on the dead guy.
Will Parsons.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.444
Local family man, married.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.751
Owns a locksmith shop in
El Dorado Hills. Clean record.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.317
Alright, let's go
talk to the wife.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.018
[voice breaking]
This has to be a mistake.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.412
Will is a, a locksmith,
not a killer. He..

06:52.499 --> 06:55.676
...he was on a house call,
fixing a rusted dead bolt.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.721
The key snapped off
in the lock.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.071
Your husband was
part of a two man team

07:00.158 --> 07:02.030
that broke into
a residential home.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.772
He brought his gun,
and he fired at our agent.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.862
If Will did that,
then somebody made him.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.516
Yeah, maybe they were
holding a gun on him.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.169
That's possible, right?

07:11.256 --> 07:12.867
When was the last time
you saw your husband, ma'am?

07:14.782 --> 07:17.175
When he left the house
last night at 11 o'clock.

07:17.262 --> 07:20.918
- Did you see him take his gun?
- No. No.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
Do you know anyone who might
have hired your husband

07:22.572 --> 07:24.269
to break into a safe?

07:24.356 --> 07:26.315
Oh, no.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.795
What is happening here?

07:29.231 --> 07:30.798
[sobbing continues]

07:30.885 --> 07:33.322
I have suspected
a security leak

07:33.409 --> 07:35.933
inside CBI for months.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.981
Too many high-profile
suspects evading arrest.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.549
Really?
Haven't noticed.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.464
Well, that's because
you stop at nothing

07:44.551 --> 07:45.900
to close cases
for your team.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.554
Why, thank you.

07:47.641 --> 07:51.079
Other CBI agents,
they have, uh, principles.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.211
- I leaned into that one.
- Mm.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.952
Miguel Leyva.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.477
'Sinaloa Cartel.'

07:57.564 --> 07:59.783
'He controls drug corridors
throughout the east bay.'

07:59.870 --> 08:01.089
[clears throat]

08:01.176 --> 08:02.873
'Two months ago,
a CBI task force'

08:02.960 --> 08:04.396
'was set for a bust.'

08:04.484 --> 08:06.094
And when they raided
his warehouse

08:06.181 --> 08:10.185
three tons of cocaine
disappeared without a trace.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.101
Someone in the CBI
tipped him off?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.842
Him and others before him.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.584
That was my instinct,
and it was confirmed

08:17.671 --> 08:20.848
by the arrest of this man.
Tommy Volker.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.807
Now, he was always a step
ahead of your team

08:23.894 --> 08:25.592
and I found out why.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.333
He had a secret
cellphone account.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.684
Now, in the days
before his arrest

08:30.771 --> 08:33.251
that number was called
six times..

08:33.338 --> 08:35.079
...from inside CBI.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.342
Well, at least
you have a suspect.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.171
Of which I am not aware.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.564
The thief who got away.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.873
Huh? You find the thief..

08:45.960 --> 08:47.875
...you find the leak.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.225
Before tonight.
That's when my blackmailer

08:50.312 --> 08:52.227
will expose the truth
about me.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.924
Well, like you said,
I'll stop at nothing.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.407
You know what's
in that box, Patrick.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.716
What do you
th-think of me?

09:03.978 --> 09:05.675
Y-you..

09:05.762 --> 09:08.591
...you're gonna have to be
a little more, uh, specific.

09:08.678 --> 09:12.203
Am I a monstrosity
to you?

09:12.290 --> 09:13.683
A monstrosity?

09:15.511 --> 09:17.339
No.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.515
I mean..

09:19.602 --> 09:23.214
...you're, you're interesting
and you're complex.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.476
I am?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.174
And obviously creative.
Tupperware.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.570
Well, I suppose
that's true.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.747
[exhales deeply]

09:33.834 --> 09:35.749
I've been afraid to ask
that until now.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.231
[waitress]
'Excuse me.'

09:45.019 --> 09:46.542
Found something.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
Nine years ago, LaRoche's
mother was physically

09:48.718 --> 09:50.764
and sexually assaulted.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.201
The attack lasted two hours.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.769
She said she begged
for mercy the whole time but..

09:55.856 --> 09:57.422
...her rapist
just ignored her.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.207
Wow. Did she survive?

09:59.294 --> 10:01.383
Three months later,
she took her life.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.560
Oh! Poor LaRoche.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.432
What does all this have to do
with a plastic container?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.609
What if there was
evidence inside?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
[clicks mouse]
Scott Saynay.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.135
The man convicted of raping
LaRoche's mother.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.398
He's serving a 12-year
sentence in Folsom.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.705
Uh, what if LaRoche
planted evidence

10:18.792 --> 10:19.749
to assure his conviction?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.490
Hmm. Like what?

10:21.577 --> 10:23.797
I don't know.
His mother's blood?

10:23.884 --> 10:26.495
I mean, it says here that
the only physical evidence

10:26.582 --> 10:29.019
linking Saynay to the crime
is her blood on his clothes.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.718
Why would LaRoche
want to keep that?

10:31.805 --> 10:33.502
Maybe he thought
he'd need it again

10:33.589 --> 10:35.330
if Saynay got out on appeal.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.071
Oh! This is crazy.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.116
How can the boss possibly
expect us to solve this?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.596
I don't know, but I really
want to know what's in that box.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.424
Yeah, me, too.
I wonder if he knows.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.123
[indistinct chattering]

10:46.210 --> 10:48.648
Hi. Can I get
a medium coffee, please?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.826
- Lisbon. I was looking for you.
- Hey, Brenda.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.871
Any developments on
the LaRoche break-in?

10:54.958 --> 10:57.221
Not yet, no. Why?

10:57.308 --> 10:58.745
The head of our
internal affairs division

10:58.832 --> 11:00.181
was shot inside his home
this morning.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.530
We need to get out
in front of the case.

11:01.617 --> 11:02.923
Well, that's what
I'm trying to do.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.272
I'm heading
to the autopsy now.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.969
I mean
from a public perspective.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.362
We can't allow people
to believe

11:07.449 --> 11:09.538
there's corruption brewing
inside CBI.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.235
Is that what
people believe?

11:11.322 --> 11:13.324
There's been some chatter
in the local blogosphere.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.848
I don't read blogs.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.850
Well, you should.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.721
It's easy to forget, but we work
in the state capital.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.462
Now I, I just came
from Bertram's office.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.420
He agrees with me
that a TV interview

11:22.507 --> 11:24.814
with a friendly reporter
is a win-win for the bureau.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.294
Well, let's win.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.730
I'll get back to you
with details.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.908
No obstruction
of the airway.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.869
The mucosa
of the epiglottis

11:35.956 --> 11:38.523
glottis, and major bronchi
are anatomic.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.484
[lowered voice]
Thanks for coming by.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.442
[lowered voice]
Since when do
we attend autopsies?

11:44.529 --> 11:45.879
Well, since we have
a deadline

11:45.966 --> 11:48.969
to confirm my diagnosis
at the crime scene.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.667
No injuries to the respiratory
system that I can see.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.756
Rheumatoid arthritis,
right? And?

11:53.843 --> 11:57.325
Well, this man, was at war
with his body, Lisbon

11:57.412 --> 12:00.415
specifically his hands.
Um, would you explain, doc?

12:02.286 --> 12:04.332
See the swelling and
inflammation around the wrists?

12:04.419 --> 12:07.204
It created a compression
of the medial nerve inside.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.771
Carpal tunnel, basically.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.642
Any repetitive use
of the subject's hands

12:10.730 --> 12:12.688
would have caused great pain.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.037
A locksmith
who can't use his hands?

12:14.124 --> 12:15.735
There's more.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.649
I noticed thickening and
scarring of the pericardium

12:17.737 --> 12:19.913
that's the sac-like structure
around the heart.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.003
- You can see it here.
- I'll take your word for it.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.874
Chronic chest pain
and shortness of breath

12:24.961 --> 12:26.180
were a way of life
for this man.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.747
Hmm. Thanks, doc.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.011
I don't get it.
Why would somebody hire

12:31.098 --> 12:32.664
a disabled thief
to rob a safe?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.188
Well, you wouldn't.
Not knowingly.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.625
Now you said Parsons here
owned a locksmith business?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.453
- Yeah, with his wife.
- I'd like to meet her.

12:44.459 --> 12:47.114
[door closes]

12:47.201 --> 12:49.551
Mom's been a wreck
since your visit this morning.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.640
She's taking the news
really hard.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.164
She and my dad
were crazy close.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.211
Oh, we'll try
to keep this brief.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.387
Mom? The CBI agents

12:59.474 --> 13:01.476
want to ask you
a few more questions.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.565
[exhales]

13:03.652 --> 13:05.654
Okay, fine.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.439
Jenna, this
is Patrick Jane.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.441
Hi. I'm sorry
for your loss.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.443
Thank you.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.271
Sarah, could you please
make us some tea?

13:16.665 --> 13:17.797
Please.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.713
I told Sarah her father
had been shot

13:21.801 --> 13:23.193
but I didn't mention
the robbery.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.500
I'm counting on you
to straighten that out.

13:25.587 --> 13:28.024
Oh, we're working on it.

13:28.111 --> 13:31.462
Quite a safe collection
your husband had.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.335
Well, he had more.
But we had to sell some off

13:34.422 --> 13:35.902
when the economy
took a dive.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.555
Yeah. Yeah,
well, most people

13:37.642 --> 13:39.035
collect for
sentimental reasons.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.864
It's an attempt to trigger
a fond memory.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.866
I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna
go out on a limb here

13:43.953 --> 13:45.346
an guess that your
husband's collection

13:45.433 --> 13:47.130
started with this
little fella.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.829
Will found that
when he was seven.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.048
It was locked, so he was
dying to know what was inside

13:52.135 --> 13:54.921
and he spent months trying every
possible number combination

13:55.008 --> 13:58.359
until finally one misty
morning, it opened.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.230
What was inside?

14:00.317 --> 14:02.319
I don't remember.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.712
That's a disappointment.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.541
No, Lisbon, it doesn't
matter what was inside.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.022
The exciting part is
the mystery of not knowing.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.893
It's what makes
the journey memorable.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.200
Will spent his entire career
following that journey.

14:13.287 --> 14:16.725
It's what made him
become a locksmith.

14:16.812 --> 14:21.208
Jenna, we found out that he was
losing the use of his hands.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.558
Why didn't you tell us
about that earlier?

14:23.645 --> 14:25.255
I didn't think of it.
You'd just told me

14:25.342 --> 14:28.171
the man I spent
my entire life with was dead.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.217
Which I still
don't understand.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
The first step
is finding out

14:31.783 --> 14:33.481
who he broke into that
house with.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.091
Did he have any employees?

14:35.178 --> 14:36.919
[Jenna]
'No. It was just Will.'

14:37.006 --> 14:38.703
He wanted to hire
a good locksmith

14:38.790 --> 14:41.054
to cut down on his workload,
but he couldn't find anybody

14:41.141 --> 14:43.056
'up to his standards.'

14:43.143 --> 14:45.449
That's incredibly valuable.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.408
You know about safes?

14:47.495 --> 14:49.540
Do you have the combination
for this?

14:49.627 --> 14:52.761
No. Will kept those
in his head.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.763
Hmm. I was hoping
you'd say that.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.898
[Jenna]
'Wait. What are you doing?'

14:58.985 --> 15:01.596
What? Jane! Stop it!

15:01.683 --> 15:03.598
Mom! What's he doing?

15:03.685 --> 15:05.600
What are you, crazy?
That's airtight!

15:05.687 --> 15:07.602
Then you'd better
get to work then.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.691
Mom! We have to do
something.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.475
What do we do?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.042
[Jenna]
'I've got it.'

15:15.349 --> 15:17.786
[intense music]

15:20.571 --> 15:22.617
[rustling]

15:22.704 --> 15:24.140
[clicking]

15:25.489 --> 15:27.448
How's she know
how to do that?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.667
Your father was losing
the use of his hands.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.582
He needed help, so he taught
everything he knew

15:31.669 --> 15:33.628
to the woman he trusted most.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.282
[Sarah]
'How come
I don't know this?'

15:35.369 --> 15:37.197
Well, I imagine your father
was a proud man, too.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.417
'Too proud
to let anyone know'

15:40.504 --> 15:42.158
his wife was doing
his job for him.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.900
[meowing]

15:44.987 --> 15:46.597
Et voila!

15:46.684 --> 15:48.251
[Jenna sniffling]

15:48.338 --> 15:49.731
[Jenna]
'Are you okay?'

15:50.471 --> 15:52.690
Take him.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.997
You're gonna have to come
with us now.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.607
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

15:56.694 --> 15:59.132
What, you're arresting her?
For what?

15:59.219 --> 16:01.786
[handcuffs clicking]
Breaking and entering,
safecracking and armed robbery.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.136
That sound about right?

16:04.180 --> 16:07.009
[instrumental music]

16:10.926 --> 16:13.363
[intense music]

16:15.061 --> 16:17.759
I'm the one who opened
your agent's safe.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.891
It was a
Sargent And Greenleaf lock

16:19.979 --> 16:22.242
and they can take hours,
and Will, just..

16:22.329 --> 16:24.896
...moving his fingers
hurt so much.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.334
And who hired you to break
into Agent LaRoche's home?

16:28.596 --> 16:30.380
Will never said.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.035
He just said somebody called
and offered him a lot of money

16:33.122 --> 16:34.689
to open a residential safe.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.084
What were you asked
to steal?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.695
A plastic container.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.914
I don't know what was in it.
I didn't ask.

16:44.655 --> 16:45.743
Where is it, ma'am?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.443
Where's the plastic
container you stole?

16:49.530 --> 16:52.402
We, um..

16:52.489 --> 16:54.665
...we had a drop point.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.799
A storm drain
in Woodley Park.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.106
When you left the shop
this morning, I..

17:00.193 --> 17:01.846
...drove to the park
and left the container.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.936
And you never
looked inside?

17:05.024 --> 17:08.505
No. I just
wanted it to be done with.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.899
'My husband lost his life
over that stupid box.'

17:11.943 --> 17:14.033
You think we're too late?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.512
Never know unless you try.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.168
[intense music]

17:25.087 --> 17:27.916
Did your contact say
where the storm drain was?

17:28.003 --> 17:29.483
Near a warning sign.

17:31.224 --> 17:34.096
[music continues]

17:47.109 --> 17:49.068
[rustling]

17:49.155 --> 17:50.417
[tape rips]

17:51.896 --> 17:53.159
[panting]

17:53.246 --> 17:54.551
Someone's already been here.

18:00.557 --> 18:03.343
[music continues]

18:04.300 --> 18:05.388
There.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.697
[music continues]

18:09.784 --> 18:11.438
- CBI! Down on the ground!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:11.525 --> 18:13.092
Put your hands
where I can see them! Down!

18:13.179 --> 18:14.441
- What'd I do?
- Now! On your knees!

18:14.528 --> 18:16.225
Get down now!

18:16.312 --> 18:18.445
He's usually a very calm man.
Now do as he says.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.968
Okay. Just don't shoot.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.404
Secure the container,
please.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.713
[intense music]

18:31.066 --> 18:32.763
Should probably check it
to be sure.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.030
[music continues]

18:41.685 --> 18:42.860
- Daddy?
- It's okay, buddy.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.297
Everything's gonna
be alright.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.649
Banana and peanut butter.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.784
[birds chirping]

18:55.830 --> 18:57.788
You're a lucky kid.
Looks tasty.

18:59.486 --> 19:02.706
I am very sorry, sir.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.406
Have a nice day.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.016
[male #1]
'Come on, buddy.
Let's get out of here.'

19:14.196 --> 19:15.241
[sighs]

19:15.328 --> 19:17.678
My time is running out.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.593
Whatever happens,
I want to thank you

19:19.680 --> 19:21.508
for trying to help me.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.815
Well, truth is, you're
a hard man not to help, LaRoche.

19:24.902 --> 19:28.341
You're like a shar-pei puppy
that's rolled onto its back.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.907
You have to rub its belly.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.257
You're mocking me.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.173
No, no, I'm happy
to rub your belly.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.349
- That won't be necessary.
- I hope not.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.787
[instrumental music]

19:43.007 --> 19:44.661
Should be here somewhere.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.011
- Uh, what was the name again?
- Scott Saynay.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.927
He's serving a 12 year sentence
for rape and indecent assault.

19:50.014 --> 19:53.235
Oh, here it is.
Scott Saynay was here.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.368
Early release.
Six weeks ago.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.892
Oh. Where's he now?

19:57.979 --> 20:01.417
Uh, should be
in here somewhere.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.680
Sorry for the mess,
but the supreme court just ruled

20:03.767 --> 20:06.727
that prison overcrowding
is unconstitutional.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.816
- What a bother.
- I know, right?

20:08.903 --> 20:12.211
We have to reduce our numbers
by 1,800 this year.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.430
Saynay was one
of the lucky ones.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.868
Uh, huh.

20:17.955 --> 20:21.959
Looks like the release file
was forwarded.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.918
You could find him
through his parole officer.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.702
And who would that be?

20:25.789 --> 20:27.878
It's in the release file.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.532
But I could put
a trace on it.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.794
Might take a few days.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.579
Yeah, we don't have
a few days.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.450
Uh, maybe we could talk
to Saynay's last cellmate.

20:34.537 --> 20:37.410
Oh! That's a good idea.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.760
Let's see who that was.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.066
Yes. Ah!

20:42.153 --> 20:45.200
Okay, should be
in here somewhere.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.463
[exhales]

20:49.378 --> 20:52.163
[machinery whirring]

20:52.251 --> 20:55.123
According to the record, you
were Saynay's last room mate?

20:55.210 --> 20:58.387
Saynay? Yeah, sure,
I remember him.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.433
Easiest cellie I ever had.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.305
Spent most nights writing
letters to his ma.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.046
Did Saynay ever give you
a sense that he felt

21:05.133 --> 21:06.526
wrongly accused
or set up?

21:07.831 --> 21:10.181
Nah! He wasn't fighting
any drama.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.445
Not that you'd know it
if he was.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.317
My boy wasn't much
of a talker.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.145
What's so funny?

21:17.232 --> 21:18.538
Ah, you'd have
to meet Saynay

21:18.625 --> 21:21.192
to fully appreciate
his quiet nature.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.891
Did he ever mention
a plastic container to you?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.241
What plastic container?

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
I guess he didn't
trust him enough.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.419
- No, clearly.
- What are you talking about?

21:30.506 --> 21:33.248
We're trying to locate
an airtight plastic box.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.728
Your cellmate knew
all about it.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.295
It was hidden in a safe
for nine years

21:36.382 --> 21:38.035
but a man was killed
stealing it this morning.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.604
Well, I'll be damned.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.345
Wait. You know
what's in the box?

21:43.432 --> 21:45.391
Well, I can guess.
Can't you?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.044
Oh, we want to hear
your guess.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.916
Nothing in that for me

21:49.003 --> 21:50.570
except I'd be pissing off
the owner of the box

21:50.657 --> 21:52.702
and who wants to mess
with a maniac like that?

21:52.789 --> 21:55.314
[whistles]
I'm done
answering their questions.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.752
Scott Saynay, convicted
nine years ago

21:58.839 --> 22:00.623
of raping and beating
LaRoche's mother.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.625
She committed suicide
three months later.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.628
That certainly qualifies
as a dramatic event in his life.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.718
He just got out of prison.
We're trying to track him down.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.894
Other than being an extreme
form of lowlife

22:10.981 --> 22:12.243
what else did you learn
about him?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.593
All we have are
his arrest files

22:13.680 --> 22:15.029
but there's nothing
surprising.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.900
He's a high school dropout,
unemployed.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.642
Multiple burglary arrests.
He was on antidepressants

22:19.729 --> 22:21.383
the night he attacked
Mrs. LaRoche.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.732
Then maybe he hired
the locksmith

22:22.819 --> 22:24.343
to open LaRoche's safe.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.083
No. The break-in is connected

22:26.170 --> 22:27.911
to LaRoche's
internal investigation.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.652
That, I'm certain of.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.263
So we still don't know
what's in the box or who has it?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.614
Okay, Teresa. Reporter's
here for your interview.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.268
Ah, Sacramento's most
eligible singles

22:37.356 --> 22:41.708
or should I say,
sexy spinsters of Sacramento?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.797
Bertram wants to put
a public face

22:43.884 --> 22:44.841
on the LaRoche break-in.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.277
Why?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.583
To assure the public
that we are not rattled

22:47.670 --> 22:49.324
by criminal attacks
on our people.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.022
But LaRoche was rattled.
He was shot.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.243
Just.. Let me do what I do.
You do what you do.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.637
Whatever that is.
Lisbon, this way, please.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.119
You only have 15 minutes.
Let's get this thing going.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.947
You're the boss, Brenda.

23:04.034 --> 23:06.123
- Really?
- Ah, I just let her think so.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.734
We haven't officially met.
Mason Braverman.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.953
Teresa Lisbon.
I have anything in my teeth?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.041
[chuckles]
No, you're good.
You're good.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.826
Okay, good. Let's do it.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.828
This is the second time

23:14.915 --> 23:17.352
Agent LaRoche's home
has been broken into, isn't it?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.572
Yes, it is.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.356
What's he hiding in there?
Jimmy Hoffa?

23:21.443 --> 23:22.749
Uh, we don't know

23:22.836 --> 23:24.794
why Agent LaRoche's
home was targeted.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.753
'He killed one of the robbers
in a gunfight.'

23:26.840 --> 23:28.494
We have the other one in custody

23:28.581 --> 23:30.583
and we expect to have
some information soon.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.411
You're certainly having
more luck

23:32.498 --> 23:35.022
than the CBI task force that
botched the Miguel Leyva raid.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.590
We heard the dangerous
cartel boss is free

23:37.677 --> 23:39.156
because someone
tipped him off.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.244
That's not my case.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.768
Okay. Turn off the camera.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.247
We agreed to a line
of questioning, Mason.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.901
- Uh, no.
- In exchange, I promised you..

23:44.988 --> 23:46.207
- A line of questioning..
- Access and an exclusive story.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.774
Which I never
agreed to, Brenda.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.558
Why don't I just step out
while you two clear this up?

23:49.645 --> 23:51.995
Teresa, be patient.
I can always call channel 10.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.389
It's your choice.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.912
No, I'm good.

23:59.742 --> 24:00.874
[clears throat]

24:02.919 --> 24:06.270
So, how does this home invasion
affect other CBI agents?

24:06.357 --> 24:08.534
The targeting
of Agent LaRoche's home

24:08.621 --> 24:11.362
is stark evidence that
no law enforcement officer

24:11.450 --> 24:13.756
'is ever truly off duty.
We're all targets.'

24:15.323 --> 24:18.282
'But J.J. LaRoche chose
to be a CBI agent'

24:18.369 --> 24:20.850
'which is a life
of serving other people.'

24:20.937 --> 24:24.463
'We all know the game,
and we all accept the risks.'

24:26.247 --> 24:29.163
[dramatic music]

24:46.746 --> 24:48.574
Heard you had some
news on the case.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.532
The phone company just confirmed
that a call was made

24:50.619 --> 24:52.882
from the CBI
to the locksmith's shop.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.884
LaRoche is right.
We've got an internal leak.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.625
That's not news, Lisbon.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.627
A phone extension
would be news.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.716
Well, they could only trace it
to the general switchboard.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.675
We're still walking around
blind, Lisbon.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.372
And we're pressed for time.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.156
LaRoche is pressed for time.
We're doing fine.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.332
- Yes..
- Hey, boss.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.596
I might have a lead.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.293
'I found this newspaper
story in the archives.'

25:12.380 --> 25:13.773
It ran seven years ago.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.601
"Will Parsons likes
to play safe"?

25:15.688 --> 25:18.081
Mm-hmm. It's a local profile
on Parsons and his collection.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.562
Same year, he entered a national
safecracking competition.

25:20.649 --> 25:21.737
placed seventh.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.347
So you're thinking that
the CBI leak

25:23.434 --> 25:25.436
read this article and knew
that Parsons could do the job?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.960
Safe bet.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.092
[laughing]

25:29.179 --> 25:30.790
That's funny.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.008
What is?

25:33.836 --> 25:35.359
Never mind.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.492
Alright, see who else
is logged into the archive

25:37.579 --> 25:39.276
and see if any CBI personnel

25:39.363 --> 25:41.670
are long-time subscribers
to the Weekly.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.673
Uh, I just may have
saved you the trouble.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.546
Uh...look at the masthead.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.331
'Specifically, look who
the managing editor was'

25:50.418 --> 25:52.855
at the Sacramento Weekly
seven years ago.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.901
Brenda Shettrick?

25:54.988 --> 25:56.903
No way. Brenda?

25:56.990 --> 25:58.600
[J.J.]
Makes sense.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.820
Most information inside CBI
runs through Shettrick.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.781
With time, I can
build a case, but..

26:05.868 --> 26:07.957
- Time is passing quickly.
- We always have time.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.829
You know how long it takes me
to solve a case?

26:09.916 --> 26:12.048
- How long?
- However long I have.

26:13.441 --> 26:17.227
But in certain
situations, uh..

26:17.314 --> 26:19.882
When I'm in a true pinch,
such as this

26:19.969 --> 26:22.102
there are compromises
that need to be made.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.321
- What kind of compromises?
- Well, for instance.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.498
I-I could.. I could bring down
Shettrick before tonight

26:27.586 --> 26:29.675
but I will have to enlist the
help of Lisbon and the team.

26:29.762 --> 26:30.893
No.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.072
Nobody can know
about the plastic box

26:36.159 --> 26:38.771
or that it was taken
from my safe.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.730
They already know.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.386
I had to confide in Lisbon

26:45.473 --> 26:48.171
that a very valuable box
was stolen from you

26:48.258 --> 26:51.392
but I did not tell her
what was inside, I swear.

26:51.479 --> 26:55.439
You had no right to reveal
its existence at all.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.616
Lisbon is my partner.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.971
Allegiances, loyalties..

27:05.058 --> 27:07.103
Yes, of course. I..

27:07.190 --> 27:09.628
Wh-what was I thinking?

27:12.718 --> 27:13.893
[clears throat]
I understand.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.897
You and Lisbon,
you are trusted friends.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.726
You do what you will,
Mr. Jane.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.860
That's what you'll do anyway.

27:24.947 --> 27:28.037
J.J., come on.
Don't be like that.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.997
[dramatic music]

27:34.348 --> 27:36.916
If we're gonna catch Shettrick,
we need to move now.

27:37.003 --> 27:39.483
All we have is Shettrick's
name on a masthead.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.355
I don't want to rush
to judgment.

27:41.442 --> 27:42.661
Well, nobody rushed.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.750
We took our time
to judgment.

27:44.837 --> 27:48.623
But now we're here,
and we need to act.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.233
Hey, if we don't arrest her
by tonight

27:50.320 --> 27:51.800
she is going to
expose LaRoche.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.280
Expose him for what?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.412
I couldn't tell you.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.979
Have you ever thought

27:57.066 --> 27:59.329
that maybe LaRoche's secret
should be known?

27:59.416 --> 28:00.853
Endlessly.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.463
But I have come
to the conclusion

28:02.550 --> 28:06.075
that whatever happened,
he has punished himself enough.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.424
I still don't know
about Shettrick.

28:07.511 --> 28:11.385
Yes, you do.
In your gut, you know.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.257
She sold you out to Volker.
You know that.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.216
Her actions almost led
to the murder

28:16.303 --> 28:18.827
of an 8-year-old boy.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.612
For once in your life, Lisbon,
don't be the voice of reason.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.484
Be the voice of wrath.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.095
Alright.

28:27.053 --> 28:29.142
How do we get the bitch?

28:33.102 --> 28:36.323
[knock on door]
Sorry, excuse me.
Uh, big to-do in the bullpen.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.717
Lisbon needs help
handling the press.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.502
What's the press doing..
Oh, Jane!

28:41.589 --> 28:43.591
Stop!

28:43.678 --> 28:45.419
Tell me what's going on.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.942
Uh, y-you remember
the drug lord that got away?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.161
Miguel Leyva.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.989
Well, CBI found
his secret estate.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.904
Uh, according to intel,
he's sitting poolside

28:51.991 --> 28:54.297
right now with a frisky blonde,
meatball sub

28:54.384 --> 28:55.995
and a fresh shipment
of drugs.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.561
What intel?

28:57.648 --> 28:59.389
Oh, I don't know,
but the rapid response team

28:59.476 --> 29:00.869
is about to conduct a raid

29:00.956 --> 29:03.785
and that TV reporter
is getting in the way.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.048
- What TV reporter?
- The one from today.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.921
Lisbon invited him
to ride along on the bust.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.792
For God sake, why?

29:10.879 --> 29:13.969
Well, good PR for
the bureau, I don't know.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.971
I guess that's what
she thought you wanted.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.407
Oh..

29:17.494 --> 29:19.366
Well, I..

29:22.978 --> 29:24.980
Look, we can't let Leyva
get away this time.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.677
We'll stack up
on the forward door

29:26.765 --> 29:28.810
with cover on all the windows,
I want a dynamic entry

29:28.897 --> 29:30.638
shock lock breach,
bang and clear.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.640
Guys, she's here.
It's time to start moving

29:32.727 --> 29:34.424
- 'Let's roll.'
- Let's not.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.296
Turn the camera off.
This hasn't been cleared.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.559
Yes, it has. I just left
Bertram's office

29:38.646 --> 29:40.430
and he says it's a win-win.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.693
He just wants you to shepherd
our TV colleagues here.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.999
No wonder you didn't
want me asking

29:44.086 --> 29:45.305
about Miguel Leyva.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.002
You knew all along
a raid was in the works.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.830
Well, of course.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.137
Okay, just let me make
a phone call before we go.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.269
We don't have time.
You're holding us up. Let's go.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.924
Here's your vest. If you hurry,
you can make the 6:00 news.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.187
Um...point the camera
away from me.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.887
Buh-bye!
Bring back a drug lord!

30:01.974 --> 30:04.498
[dramatic music]

30:10.547 --> 30:13.028
[dramatic music]

30:13.115 --> 30:14.247
[Kimball]
'This is a high-risk
operation.'

30:14.334 --> 30:16.162
Surprise, speed,
and domination are key.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.903
'Our goals are to clear
any threats'

30:17.990 --> 30:20.775
and prevent the destruction
of any evidence.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.212
'Excuse me,
what are you doing?'

30:23.299 --> 30:25.649
I told you I need to cancel
an appointment.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.042
There's no outside
communications

30:27.129 --> 30:28.217
during an operation.

30:28.304 --> 30:29.784
It's standard procedure.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.656
Great.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.274
Moving out.
Remember the tactical plan.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.145
You three stay with Karl.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.586
You want us with?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.153
Sh-shouldn't we wait
in the van?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.720
Bertram approved
full access.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.678
This is great, Brenda.
You're the best.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.680
Stay focused on the breach team.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.076
[dramatic music]

31:06.299 --> 31:08.170
- Wait!
- Shh! Quiet!

31:08.257 --> 31:10.390
I left my Kevlar vest
in the van.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.958
Then you hold right here.
We can't wait for you.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.621
[whispering]
Okay. Okay, okay.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.363
[beeping]

31:28.756 --> 31:31.802
Come on. Come on, come on.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.240
- 'Yeah. What up?'
- Miguel, it's Brenda Shettrick.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.242
Don't talk. Listen. They're
about to break down your door.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.461
Now, I will make it go away just
like I did with the last raid.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.768
Just don't say anything
to them.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.378
Slow down, woman.
What are you talking about?

31:42.465 --> 31:44.337
No time. Here they come.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.733
[dramatic music]

31:52.649 --> 31:54.042
Police! Search warrant!

31:54.129 --> 31:55.870
Stand away from the door!

31:56.915 --> 31:59.308
[gunshot]

32:05.401 --> 32:06.533
[gunshot]

32:10.841 --> 32:12.365
[gunfire]

32:18.762 --> 32:20.634
Is it clear?

32:20.721 --> 32:23.289
[Patrick]
'Yeah, we're clear.'

32:27.902 --> 32:30.818
[dramatic music]

32:43.570 --> 32:45.528
Hey.

32:45.615 --> 32:48.401
What's going on?
Get that away from me.

32:51.186 --> 32:54.015
What are you doing here?

32:54.102 --> 32:55.625
Where's Miguel Leyva?

32:55.712 --> 32:57.018
Well, probably relaxing
at his pad

32:57.105 --> 32:58.063
wherever the hell that is.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.890
Oh, this place
is on the market

32:59.978 --> 33:02.763
'but you're gonna need to save
your pennies to post bail.'

33:02.850 --> 33:04.721
You're welcome
to join us, Brenda.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.549
We were just reviewing
the footage.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.595
What footage?

33:08.682 --> 33:10.510
Very telegenic.
Don't you think?

33:10.597 --> 33:12.077
[Brenda on TV]
'Don't talk. Listen.'

33:12.164 --> 33:13.078
'They're about
to break down your door.'

33:13.165 --> 33:14.427
'I will make it go away'

33:14.514 --> 33:15.689
'just like I did
with the last raid.'

33:15.776 --> 33:17.821
'Just don't say anything
to them.'

33:17.908 --> 33:20.433
You promised me an exclusive.
You weren't kidding.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.261
How much did Miguel Leyva
pay you to tip him off

33:22.348 --> 33:23.523
about the drug raid?

33:23.610 --> 33:25.133
Go to hell.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.787
[Mason]
'Excellent.'

33:31.748 --> 33:33.750
You know how this works,
Brenda.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.404
It'll go a lot easier
if you just..

33:35.491 --> 33:37.145
I do know how this works.

33:37.232 --> 33:38.712
That's what you tell
the sheep

33:38.799 --> 33:40.366
on their way to slaughter.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.194
Why do they bleat?

33:42.281 --> 33:45.893
I never understood that when
I watched your interrogations.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.199
I want a lawyer.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.027
Well, I guess she's too smart.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.637
Not that smart.

33:50.724 --> 33:53.683
We have her on tape
tipping off a cartel boss.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.511
Same way she tipped off
Tommy Volker.

33:55.598 --> 33:56.904
She's going down.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.124
I just wish I knew why.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.039
Well, I don't think
she's gonna tell you.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.779
But I will.

34:02.866 --> 34:06.870
You don't know
the first thing about me.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.568
You were an East Coast
prep girl.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.005
College? Uh, Barnard.

34:11.092 --> 34:14.008
'Or maybe Mount Holyoke'

34:14.095 --> 34:15.575
for the horseback
riding trails.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.055
She does like horses.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.969
You were a romantic.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.276
You moved to the state capital
because you wanted to expose

34:21.363 --> 34:23.757
fakes and frauds

34:23.844 --> 34:26.934
and fall in love, and write
stories in coffee shops.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.109
She does like coffee.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.632
A lot of people
like coffee.

34:29.719 --> 34:33.071
Here's the one problem.
You couldn't write.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.986
Your skill set was more
managing editor.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.076
Managing editors are
the second highest ranking

34:38.163 --> 34:39.729
position at a newspaper.

34:39.816 --> 34:42.428
Yes. The allure of power.

34:42.515 --> 34:44.212
It's why you joined the CBI

34:44.299 --> 34:47.694
so you could rub elbows with
all the big players in town.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.261
You're so off.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.392
[chuckles]

34:50.479 --> 34:52.351
Never did fall in love.

34:52.438 --> 34:55.049
Well, at least, uh..

34:55.136 --> 34:57.573
No one fell in love
with you.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.273
'So you found your thrills
in the arms of power'

35:01.360 --> 35:05.059
trading favors
and inside information

35:05.146 --> 35:06.974
to anyone who'd have you.

35:08.715 --> 35:12.284
And in the end, you became
exactly what you hated.

35:13.850 --> 35:17.202
Just another political phony
on the take.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.901
[bleating]

35:29.388 --> 35:31.694
Van Pelt and I made a bet
what's in the plastic ware.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.653
Animal, a vegetable,
or mineral.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.002
What do you think?

35:35.089 --> 35:37.831
Check the file cabinet.

35:37.918 --> 35:40.268
Van Pelt says animal.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.878
I say vegetable.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.271
Van Pelt wins.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.664
No way!

35:44.751 --> 35:46.361
If it was biological,
you'd freeze it.

35:46.448 --> 35:47.971
Tupperware,
it's for food storage.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.756
Has to be vegetable.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.323
[sighs]
Like what, broccoli?

35:51.410 --> 35:53.020
I don't know.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.286
hey, hey, hey.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.636
Check it out.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.423
Ooh.
It exists.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.033
Yeah, it's a box.
Let's go.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.427
Hang on. Don't you care
what's inside?

36:08.514 --> 36:09.776
No.

36:11.604 --> 36:12.692
I think there's something
stuck to the bottom.

36:12.779 --> 36:15.608
Oh, oh, oh. Uh.

36:15.695 --> 36:18.088
Is that yours to open?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.047
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.399
'Tsk, tsk, tsk.'

36:31.058 --> 36:33.974
[dramatic music]

36:49.511 --> 36:51.296
[sighs]

36:51.383 --> 36:53.341
Thank you
for keeping my secret.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.388
Eh. It was easy.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.346
I'm afraid Brenda Shettrick

36:58.433 --> 37:00.043
can still bring me down
with what she knows.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.915
She won't.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.047
How can you be sure?

37:04.134 --> 37:05.571
Shettrick likes to trade.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.225
She's cutting a deal
with the DA right now

37:07.312 --> 37:08.791
to give up her drug lord.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.837
She told Lisbon she'd
forget about Tupperware

37:10.924 --> 37:13.231
if we forget about
blackmail charges.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.627
How did Shettrick know about
the box to begin with?

37:18.714 --> 37:21.021
Only you and I knew
of its existence.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.371
You and I..

37:23.458 --> 37:25.547
And..

37:25.634 --> 37:26.940
Donny Culpepper.

37:28.811 --> 37:32.119
Small-time thief I hired
to break into your safe.

37:32.206 --> 37:35.122
She must have bought
the information from him.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.341
Ah.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.474
Well..

37:42.172 --> 37:45.611
...this concludes our business
together, Mr. Jane.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.569
I certainly hope not.

37:50.006 --> 37:52.835
You've never asked me
why I keep this.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.837
I appreciate that.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.362
But I suppose you must wonder.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.277
I wouldn't be human
if I didn't.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.542
I hold on to this box
as a warning.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.501
It reminds me of the depths

38:06.588 --> 38:09.199
to which a man can sink
if he lets himself.

38:10.940 --> 38:14.292
And...it reminds me
of my mother.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.695
Goodnight, J.J.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.480
Goodnight, Patrick.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.226
[Teresa]
'So?'

38:36.314 --> 38:38.577
Did you look in the box?

38:38.664 --> 38:40.622
And violate
the man's privacy?

38:40.709 --> 38:42.494
Yes.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.887
What's inside the box is of
far less significance to me

38:44.974 --> 38:46.541
than what the box represents.

38:46.628 --> 38:47.847
I just want to know

38:47.934 --> 38:50.632
why you bent over
backwards for that man.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.464
What's important to know

38:56.551 --> 38:57.900
is that a man will go
to extreme lengths

38:57.987 --> 38:59.772
to find peace.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.514
As I must do now.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.559
What are you talking about?

39:04.646 --> 39:08.041
Until I come out of this room,
I need to be alone, Lisbon.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.608
Alone. No interruptions.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.479
- But--
- No distractions.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.568
Please.

39:14.526 --> 39:15.831
Okay.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.616
- Do what you have to do.
- Thank you.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.537
[indistinct chatter]

39:26.799 --> 39:28.322
Hey. Is Jane up there?

39:28.409 --> 39:30.019
Yeah, but he's busy.
What's up?

39:30.106 --> 39:31.369
He asked me to tell him
when I found

39:31.456 --> 39:33.501
the ex-con who assaulted
LaRoche's mother.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.243
- Oh, no need. It's over now.
- Okay.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.679
You want to hear
something creepy, though?

39:37.766 --> 39:40.247
The rapist
lives with his mom.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.292
Uh, can I get that address?

39:43.119 --> 39:44.294
Sure.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.606
[Teresa]
'Mrs. Saynay'

39:51.693 --> 39:53.565
'one of my colleagues
called you earlier.'

39:53.652 --> 39:55.088
I'm with the CBI.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.483
You can call me Judith.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.355
I'm Teresa Lisbon.

40:02.225 --> 40:04.140
Uh, you people, um..

40:05.707 --> 40:08.623
Need my son's help
to help you solve a case?

40:08.710 --> 40:10.277
Is that right?

40:10.364 --> 40:12.192
To help solve a mystery,
at least.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.325
Scott!

40:15.413 --> 40:17.153
Get down here!

40:17.240 --> 40:18.981
You got a visitor!

40:20.505 --> 40:24.683
He needs a little
extra motivation sometimes.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.467
How long has your son
lived with you?

40:26.554 --> 40:27.990
Oh..

40:28.077 --> 40:30.297
Came straight out of jail.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.387
I'd pretend
to be flattered..

40:33.474 --> 40:34.997
[chuckles]

40:35.084 --> 40:37.173
Uh, but I-I'm all
that he's got.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.567
Hmm.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.787
Vice versa, too. Mm.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.142
[footsteps approaching]

40:56.541 --> 40:58.978
Hello. I'm Agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.502
I need you to answer
some questions for me.

41:04.418 --> 41:06.115
You mean you, you..

41:06.202 --> 41:07.987
You don't know?

41:08.074 --> 41:09.467
What?

41:10.903 --> 41:12.731
Scott hasn't..

41:12.818 --> 41:15.168
Spoken in nine years.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.388
Well, why?

41:18.476 --> 41:20.652
Well, the, the day before
his trial

41:20.739 --> 41:23.350
somebody broke into
his apartment

41:23.437 --> 41:25.918
while he was
sleeping, and..

41:26.005 --> 41:28.137
They injected him
with a sedative

41:28.224 --> 41:31.010
and cut out his tongue.

41:31.097 --> 41:34.230
'The police, they never
figured out who did it'

41:34.317 --> 41:37.233
you know, or why, or..

41:37.320 --> 41:38.844
'Oh.'

41:38.931 --> 41:41.281
and they never found
his tongue.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.636
[mumbling]

41:51.117 --> 41:52.988
[mumbling]

42:03.651 --> 42:06.132
[theme music]
