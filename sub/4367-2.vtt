WEBVTT

00:02.574 --> 00:04.891
So nice to finally meet you, Harold.

00:04.893 --> 00:06.276
You can call me Root.

00:06.278 --> 00:07.911
When she took Finch, Root killed

00:07.913 --> 00:10.413
a former intelligence operative
named Alicia Corwin.

00:10.415 --> 00:12.365
You should be trying
to figure out what I want

00:12.367 --> 00:13.399
and where we're going.

00:13.401 --> 00:15.035
Where are we going?

00:15.037 --> 00:16.903
The future, Harold.

00:16.905 --> 00:18.488
I've got a lead on Finch.

00:18.490 --> 00:20.170
You know where our mystery woman's headed?

00:20.171 --> 00:22.959
No, but I think I found out
where she's from.

00:22.961 --> 00:25.895
Pack your bags, Carter,
we're going to Texas.

00:30.885 --> 00:33.252
911.
What is your emergency?

00:33.254 --> 00:35.305
Hello, who is this?

00:35.307 --> 00:38.858
It's about Hanna,
the girl who's gone missing.

00:46.367 --> 00:49.486
- So what's this all about?
- What do you mean?

00:49.488 --> 00:51.304
I promised you guys that round of drinks.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.239
It's 8:00 AM.

00:53.241 --> 00:55.241
Which means Finch
has already been gone 24 hours,

00:55.242 --> 00:56.402
but we're gonna get him back.

00:56.403 --> 00:58.111
This have a raw egg in it?

00:58.113 --> 01:00.213
The alcohol will kill the salmonella.

01:00.215 --> 01:01.895
You find out anything on the girl, Carter?

01:01.896 --> 01:05.885
Yeah.
1991, 14-year-old Hanna Frey

01:05.887 --> 01:08.588
walks out of the public library
in Bishop, Texas,

01:08.590 --> 01:10.140
never to be seen again.

01:10.142 --> 01:13.226
She'd be 35 today.
Seems about right.

01:13.228 --> 01:15.979
That girl became Root,
and now she's got Finch.

01:15.981 --> 01:17.664
Nothing else about her

01:17.666 --> 01:20.316
in any national law enforcement
database since, John.

01:20.318 --> 01:24.437
Look, I need to know where
you're getting your information.

01:24.439 --> 01:25.738
I can't tell you that.

01:25.740 --> 01:27.306
But we find out what happened to her,

01:27.308 --> 01:29.159
- we find Finch.
- This girl...

01:29.161 --> 01:31.644
Been gone 20 years without a trace.

01:31.646 --> 01:32.912
How long you been drinking?

01:32.914 --> 01:35.198
We're going to Bishop, Texas,

01:35.200 --> 01:37.167
to find out what happened to Hanna Frey.

01:37.169 --> 01:38.368
What about me?

01:38.370 --> 01:40.253
I need you to stay here, Lionel.

01:40.255 --> 01:42.088
Work the Alicia Corwin case.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.990
Find out why Corwin was in New York,

01:43.992 --> 01:46.209
and find out who's messing with the case.

01:46.211 --> 01:48.044
Maybe this'll help.

01:53.168 --> 01:54.601
Did you just jack my phone?

01:54.603 --> 01:56.186
It's a malware app.

01:56.188 --> 01:57.770
Little tip...
someone offers you

01:57.772 --> 02:00.390
a great deal on any sort
of male-enhancement pill,

02:00.392 --> 02:02.642
don't click on it.

02:02.644 --> 02:03.977
Another thing.

02:03.979 --> 02:05.659
I need you to look after a friend of mine.

02:10.785 --> 02:15.155
Bear, remember Lionel?

02:21.129 --> 02:24.414
Where are we on the Corwin mess?

02:24.416 --> 02:26.249
A few loose ends to clean up,

02:26.251 --> 02:29.385
but I wouldn't worry
about the evidence trail.

02:29.387 --> 02:32.305
Consider the chain of custody broken.

02:32.307 --> 02:37.227
We need to find out
what brought her to New York.

02:37.229 --> 02:41.264
I think I have a lead on where
she was staying in the city.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.399
Just make sure you get there first.

02:43.401 --> 02:45.401
No telling what kind of smoking gun

02:45.403 --> 02:47.220
that nut job left lying around.

02:47.222 --> 02:48.571
A dead nut job.

02:48.573 --> 02:49.889
Used to work for Denton Weeks.

02:49.891 --> 02:51.574
Let me worry about Weeks.

02:51.576 --> 02:54.077
What do we know about
the assigned working the case?

03:00.785 --> 03:02.952
I wouldn't sweat that too much.

03:02.954 --> 03:06.122
Not exactly New York's finest
working on this one.

03:06.124 --> 03:07.724
Okay.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.771 --> 03:22.088
Lucky you called when you did.

03:22.090 --> 03:25.892
Deer season just started.
Booked up solid for the week.

03:35.870 --> 03:37.904
I don't think so.

03:37.906 --> 03:39.489
We're gonna need another room.

03:39.491 --> 03:41.124
Afraid I can't help you there.

03:41.126 --> 03:42.992
I've got three RVs backed up in the lot

03:42.994 --> 03:45.245
looking for a room with running water.

03:45.247 --> 03:46.913
Thanks.
This won't be a problem.

03:49.783 --> 03:53.720
So what exactly
are the sleeping arrangements?

03:53.722 --> 03:55.305
I don't plan on sleeping much.

03:55.307 --> 03:59.642
And if I do, the bathtub will...

03:59.644 --> 04:01.311
the floor will be fine.

04:01.313 --> 04:02.800
Let's go down to the police station

04:02.801 --> 04:04.681
and get ahold of that case file
on Hanna Frey.

04:04.683 --> 04:06.099
Okay.
Wait.

04:06.101 --> 04:07.984
Let's set up some ground rules here.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.486
You keep a low profile and let me deal

04:10.488 --> 04:12.471
with the local law enforcement, all right?

04:12.473 --> 04:14.991
That's why you're here.

04:16.527 --> 04:18.528
It's regarding the Hanna Frey case

04:18.529 --> 04:19.978
back in '91.

04:19.981 --> 04:21.831
Yes, ma'am, I remember it well.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.153
What's your interest in the case,

04:23.154 --> 04:25.418
- Detective,
- Carter.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.300
I may have a missing persons
case in the Bronx

04:27.301 --> 04:28.755
that matches the MO.

04:28.757 --> 04:31.124
A young girl went missing
from a public library,

04:31.126 --> 04:32.825
like Hanna Frey, and one of my suspects

04:32.827 --> 04:34.327
used to live in Texas.

04:34.329 --> 04:36.212
Really?
What's the suspect's name?

04:36.214 --> 04:39.515
Unfortunately, I'm not
at liberty to share names.

04:39.517 --> 04:42.185
Still a developing case.

04:42.187 --> 04:43.987
Sheriff, I'd really just
like to have a look

04:43.988 --> 04:45.388
at Hanna's case file.

04:45.390 --> 04:47.870
Yeah, well, I'd really like to
have the name of this suspect,

04:47.871 --> 04:50.059
seeing as how it might help break a case

04:50.061 --> 04:53.313
that's haunted this department
some 20 years.

04:53.315 --> 04:55.648
Right.
Unfortunately,

04:55.650 --> 04:58.318
my loo hasn't signed off
on a joint investigation.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.819
I don't see why not.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.687
He sent you all the way
down here, didn't he?

05:01.689 --> 05:03.122
Sign here, please.

05:03.124 --> 05:04.240
Well, hello.

05:04.242 --> 05:05.875
What happened to Dan today?

05:05.877 --> 05:08.461
- He got rerouted.
- Well, that is too bad.

05:08.463 --> 05:10.713
Mind if I use your restroom?

05:10.715 --> 05:12.531
Help yourself.
It's just down the hall

05:12.533 --> 05:15.534
and to the left.

05:15.536 --> 05:17.587
All right, I'll tell you what.

05:17.589 --> 05:19.229
Why don't you give me the name and number

05:19.230 --> 05:22.375
of your loo, and I'll call him myself.

05:22.377 --> 05:25.978
No?
Well, that's too bad.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.849
Well, I hope you enjoy
your stay here in Bishop.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.934
Hunting and fishing, second to none.

05:37.741 --> 05:39.742
What the...

05:39.744 --> 05:41.861
Is that what I think it is?

05:41.863 --> 05:43.696
Plenty of leads to follow up on.

05:43.698 --> 05:45.615
Here.

05:45.617 --> 05:47.417
I don't know what you just did,

05:47.419 --> 05:48.951
but this is not the way...

05:48.953 --> 05:50.873
There was even a 911 call
from someone claiming

05:50.874 --> 05:52.634
they saw Hanna
get into the car that night.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.875
They gave a plate number too,
but it didn't check out.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.127
What do you think?

05:58.129 --> 06:00.513
I think we start from the beginning.

06:00.515 --> 06:02.915
We need to talk to whoever saw Hanna last.

06:02.917 --> 06:04.634
She's still out there, Carter.

06:04.636 --> 06:07.286
I'm telling you, that girl became Root.

06:13.444 --> 06:17.280
Amazing. We've managed
to perfect the apple...

06:17.282 --> 06:20.099
a genetically modified version
that never goes brown.

06:20.101 --> 06:24.287
And yet, we still haven't
upgraded human beings.

06:24.289 --> 06:27.240
The human race has stalled out, Harold.

06:27.242 --> 06:28.941
And from what I've seen,

06:28.943 --> 06:31.461
most of it is rotten to the core.

06:31.463 --> 06:35.965
Harold, generous to a fault.

06:35.967 --> 06:39.385
Always letting someone else
take credit for your work.

06:39.387 --> 06:42.605
I'd recognize your code anywhere.

06:42.607 --> 06:47.310
It's so... elegant.

06:47.312 --> 06:49.645
- Then let it be.
- I told you,

06:49.647 --> 06:51.481
I don't want to control your machine.

06:51.483 --> 06:53.649
Then why are we here?

06:53.651 --> 06:58.637
We're here to observe
another kind of code.

06:58.639 --> 07:00.306
The bad code.

07:00.308 --> 07:03.860
Clearly, we differ
in our views of humanity.

07:03.862 --> 07:06.496
Do we?
Then why are you the father

07:06.498 --> 07:09.749
of a seismic shift in intelligence,

07:09.751 --> 07:12.585
forced to live in fear and anonymity?

07:12.587 --> 07:14.921
You don't know anything about me.

07:14.923 --> 07:20.543
But I do, Harold.

07:20.545 --> 07:24.597
You're the man who sold the world.

07:24.599 --> 07:27.717
Just to the wrong people.

07:27.719 --> 07:30.720
I will get access to the machine, Harold.

07:30.722 --> 07:35.274
And either you can show me how to do that,

07:35.276 --> 07:40.313
or this sad specimen will.

07:40.315 --> 07:41.647
Denton Weeks...

07:41.649 --> 07:45.284
the man you sold the machine to.

07:45.286 --> 07:47.570
One of you will walk out of here

07:47.572 --> 07:51.657
onto the next stage of our adventure.

07:51.659 --> 07:54.377
I do hope it's you, Harold.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.001
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:16.122 --> 08:18.040
Of course I remember.

08:18.042 --> 08:20.525
I only wish I could forget.

08:20.527 --> 08:24.046
Hanna was a bright girl.
Mostly kept to herself.

08:24.048 --> 08:26.915
Did you notice anything
off about her that night?

08:26.917 --> 08:28.550
Not really.

08:28.552 --> 08:31.086
She was at the computers over there.

08:31.088 --> 08:34.006
Like she was almost every night.

08:34.008 --> 08:36.140
We didn't have internet back then,

08:36.143 --> 08:38.394
just a couple of PCs and a few games.

08:38.395 --> 08:40.245
Educational, of course.

08:58.582 --> 09:00.565
You gave the police a list of everyone

09:00.567 --> 09:02.067
who was in the library that night?

09:02.069 --> 09:04.736
Yes.
Thank you.

09:04.738 --> 09:06.372
The library was about to close.

09:06.374 --> 09:07.923
Everyone was leaving.

09:07.925 --> 09:10.242
I see you found the new Stephen King.

09:10.244 --> 09:14.913
I really enjoyed the last one.

09:14.915 --> 09:16.849
Thanks, Barbara.

09:20.654 --> 09:22.721
Damn it.

09:22.723 --> 09:24.690
Death by dysentery again.

09:24.692 --> 09:26.642
That game's so dumb, Hanna.

09:26.644 --> 09:29.061
I don't see why you play it.

09:29.063 --> 09:30.646
Because I'm gonna get to Oregon.

09:30.648 --> 09:32.481
The library will be closing
in ten minutes.

09:32.483 --> 09:35.701
Bring any books you'd like
to check out to the counter.

09:35.703 --> 09:38.103
- See ya.
- Bye.

09:40.707 --> 09:41.990
Hey.

09:41.992 --> 09:44.460
Hanna checked out a couple of books.

09:45.962 --> 09:49.048
- Thank you.
- Good night, Hanna.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.619
And then she was gone.

09:54.621 --> 09:56.638
That's the last time anyone ever saw her?

09:56.640 --> 09:58.807
I had no idea there was
something to worry about

09:58.809 --> 10:00.625
until I got a call from Sheriff Landry

10:00.627 --> 10:02.127
in the middle of the night saying

10:02.129 --> 10:03.896
Hanna never made it home.

10:03.898 --> 10:05.481
Her parents still live here?

10:05.483 --> 10:07.149
Her mother passed a few years ago.

10:07.151 --> 10:09.902
I still see her father
every once in a while.

10:09.904 --> 10:13.655
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

10:17.544 --> 10:19.745
You don't believe Hanna
could still be alive.

10:19.747 --> 10:22.531
That was my wife's curse.

10:22.533 --> 10:25.667
Refused to believe Hanna was gone.

10:25.669 --> 10:28.087
Thought she was still out there somewhere.

10:28.089 --> 10:29.821
Do you have any idea what happened?

10:29.823 --> 10:31.090
Of course I do.

10:31.092 --> 10:34.009
Everyone in town knows what happened.

10:34.011 --> 10:36.712
The cops interrogated that son of a bitch

10:36.714 --> 10:37.996
for over two days.

10:37.998 --> 10:39.598
Cody Grayson?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.550
It wasn't the first time
he followed her home,

10:41.552 --> 10:44.520
but they can't prove
a damn thing without a body.

10:44.522 --> 10:48.774
Then one night, me and my brother

10:48.776 --> 10:50.592
paid Cody a visit.

10:50.594 --> 10:52.227
Did you get the truth?

10:52.229 --> 10:55.114
The smirking son of a bitch
said he never touched her.

10:55.116 --> 10:58.400
Said she probably ran to escape
her jerk of a father.

10:58.402 --> 11:00.185
What ever happened to Cody?

11:00.187 --> 11:01.987
Most nights I hear
he's rotting his guts out

11:01.988 --> 11:05.324
at The Razorback.

11:05.326 --> 11:08.377
Thank you.

11:10.296 --> 11:13.048
Anyone ever reach out to you
after Hanna was gone?

11:13.050 --> 11:16.418
Any correspondence or
information that might help us?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.754
Nothing except some credit card junk mail

11:18.756 --> 11:21.306
a couple times a year.

11:21.308 --> 11:22.724
But they were in Hanna's name?

11:22.726 --> 11:25.561
Did she have a credit card
or a bank account?

11:25.563 --> 11:26.979
No, she was still a minor.

11:26.981 --> 11:29.548
You got one of those letters?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.650
I threw out another one
a couple of days ago.

11:31.652 --> 11:34.319
Probably still in the trash.

11:34.321 --> 11:36.521
Hey, you think it's odd
that Alicia Corwin didn't have

11:36.522 --> 11:37.642
her hotel key on her person?

11:37.643 --> 11:39.558
Maybe she left it at the hotel.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.777
Maybe she left everything at the hotel.

11:41.779 --> 11:43.592
Because that's not the only discrepancy

11:43.593 --> 11:44.913
between what's listed in evidence

11:44.915 --> 11:46.331
and what's actually here.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.834
Yeah, ballistics report was corrupted too.

11:48.836 --> 11:50.836
Someone really wants this to go away.

11:50.838 --> 11:54.006
You find that person,
maybe you'll get some answers.

11:54.008 --> 11:57.176
And, Fusco, be careful
who you read in on the case.

11:57.178 --> 12:01.046
Yeah. All right.
I'll talk with you later.

12:01.048 --> 12:03.849
Okay.

12:18.415 --> 12:22.868
Look at the guy in the suit.

12:22.870 --> 12:25.270
- Cody Grayson.
- Hey, Wall Street.

12:25.272 --> 12:28.540
You lost?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.876
End of the bar.

12:30.878 --> 12:33.045
- Look at this guy.
- Who's that?

12:37.951 --> 12:39.084
Hello, Cody.

12:39.086 --> 12:40.919
I know you?

12:40.921 --> 12:43.922
You knew someone I'm looking for.

12:43.924 --> 12:45.140
Hanna Frey.

12:45.142 --> 12:47.342
You a journalist or a fed?

12:47.344 --> 12:50.012
- Neither.
- Good.

12:52.965 --> 12:55.734
- Get off of him!
- I asked you nicely.

13:13.086 --> 13:15.604
Let's try that again.

13:15.606 --> 13:17.372
What did you do with Hanna Frey?

13:17.374 --> 13:18.924
What do you want me to say, man,

13:18.926 --> 13:21.510
that I cut her up,
dumped her in the swamp?

13:21.512 --> 13:24.379
Ain't nothing you can do

13:24.381 --> 13:27.466
this town hasn't already done worse.

13:29.769 --> 13:32.187
What happened to Hanna?
Where is she?

13:32.189 --> 13:35.974
If I knew, maybe I'd still be able to see

13:35.976 --> 13:37.025
out of this eye.

13:37.027 --> 13:42.114
Let me guess...
Cody Grayson.

13:42.116 --> 13:44.116
I thought I'd buy him a round.

13:44.118 --> 13:47.703
Making friends?

13:47.705 --> 13:51.323
Yeah, you'll never get the truth
out of anybody like that.

13:51.325 --> 13:53.191
I already did.
He didn't do it.

13:53.193 --> 13:55.026
I could have told you that.

13:55.028 --> 13:58.714
Looks like you might be right
about Hanna Frey.

13:58.716 --> 14:00.132
Junk mail with her name on it.

14:00.134 --> 14:02.050
Ran a credit check.

14:02.052 --> 14:03.919
Discovered a bank account
opened in her name

14:03.921 --> 14:07.005
back in '93, two years
after she disappeared.

14:07.007 --> 14:10.425
So either Hanna's communicating
from beyond the grave, or...

14:10.427 --> 14:13.512
She's still alive.

14:19.652 --> 14:22.571
Can you please make this stop?

14:22.573 --> 14:25.056
Another hour in that hood,

14:25.058 --> 14:28.694
and he'll believe anything I say.

14:28.696 --> 14:30.829
Amazing how easily the human brain

14:30.831 --> 14:33.148
can be manipulated.

14:36.787 --> 14:39.121
But you know that, don't you, Denton?

14:43.210 --> 14:46.745
A top-secret DOD memo
authorizing

14:46.747 --> 14:49.097
enhanced interrogation techniques,

14:49.099 --> 14:52.968
including "Palestinian hanging,"

14:52.970 --> 14:55.854
which you are currently enjoying.

14:55.856 --> 15:00.225
Whose signature is at the end?

15:00.227 --> 15:02.477
- Why, it's yours.
- Please...

15:02.479 --> 15:04.613
water.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.868
Sorry, not allowed.

15:09.870 --> 15:12.571
Unless you tell me what I want to know.

15:12.573 --> 15:14.706
Lady, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.107
I'm a White House lawyer.

15:16.109 --> 15:19.161
I sign documents.
I don't read 'em.

15:19.163 --> 15:21.246
Please, for the love of God, let me down.

15:21.248 --> 15:23.081
If you tell me where the machine is.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.466
What machine?

15:24.468 --> 15:26.785
The machine he built.

15:26.787 --> 15:30.222
The machine Nathan Ingram
sold you for one US dollar.

15:30.224 --> 15:31.757
You know where it is.

15:31.759 --> 15:34.226
I don't know anything.
I swear.

15:34.228 --> 15:39.147
Really, Harold, why do men always seek

15:39.149 --> 15:41.800
to delay the inevitable?

15:44.637 --> 15:47.138
What happened to you?

15:47.140 --> 15:49.491
Me?

15:49.493 --> 15:53.762
You think I was damaged?
Some childhood trauma?

15:55.481 --> 15:59.501
That is so sweet.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.594
Let him down.

16:26.596 --> 16:28.747
Please.

16:28.749 --> 16:33.201
Well, you did say please.

16:45.247 --> 16:48.216
Water, please.

16:58.928 --> 17:02.731
We need to get this show on the road.

17:02.733 --> 17:06.284
And since you just drank
half a pint of sodium pentothal,

17:06.286 --> 17:08.770
that gives me time to go gas up the car.

17:08.771 --> 17:10.438
By the time I get back,

17:10.440 --> 17:14.626
you'll be ready to spill
everything in your little head.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.855
You.

17:26.857 --> 17:29.023
I know you.

17:29.025 --> 17:32.293
You work with Nathan Ingram.

17:32.295 --> 17:34.829
You have to help me get free.

17:34.831 --> 17:37.866
We have a major problem.

17:37.868 --> 17:42.153
She cannot get access to the machine.

17:44.707 --> 17:48.326
Assuming Hanna runs away,
a couple years later,

17:48.328 --> 17:50.144
she winds up in Lafayette, Louisiana,

17:50.146 --> 17:53.381
opens an account, 100 grand is paid in,

17:53.383 --> 17:56.785
withdrawn in cash
over the next three weeks

17:56.787 --> 17:58.453
until the account is closed.

17:58.455 --> 18:00.538
100 grand.

18:00.540 --> 18:03.541
Where does a 16-year-old runaway
get all that money?

18:03.543 --> 18:06.261
Jose Barilla, currently
serving 17 life sentences

18:06.263 --> 18:08.463
for drug trafficking and murder.

18:08.465 --> 18:11.249
The money was electronically
transferred out of his account.

18:11.251 --> 18:14.102
You did say this Root woman
was good with computers.

18:14.104 --> 18:15.854
Yes, I did.

18:15.856 --> 18:17.422
But where does the account lead us?

18:17.424 --> 18:18.673
Right back here.

18:18.675 --> 18:20.642
There was a co-signatory
on the account.

18:20.644 --> 18:23.194
A guy named Trent Russell.

18:23.196 --> 18:25.280
Local address, right here in Bishop.

18:25.282 --> 18:26.698
Name sounds familiar.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.066
Yeah, he was on the witness list,

18:28.068 --> 18:29.984
in the library that night she disappeared.

18:29.986 --> 18:33.988
You still got that address?

18:35.124 --> 18:37.325
Who is it?

18:37.327 --> 18:39.210
Mrs. Russell,
it's Detective Carter.

18:39.212 --> 18:41.746
Is your husband at home?

18:41.748 --> 18:43.965
Mrs. Russell?

18:43.967 --> 18:45.199
Yes.

18:45.201 --> 18:48.419
Trent Russell is your husband?

18:48.421 --> 18:49.754
Can we talk to him?

18:49.756 --> 18:53.942
Trent passed away almost 15 years ago.

18:53.944 --> 18:56.311
I'm so sorry.

18:56.313 --> 18:59.564
- Can we come in?
- Come in.

19:06.272 --> 19:08.523
We were only married a few years.

19:08.525 --> 19:10.491
We met at the library.

19:10.493 --> 19:14.779
Trent was a member
of the monthly book club.

19:14.781 --> 19:17.448
I miss him so much.

19:17.450 --> 19:18.917
How did he die?

19:18.919 --> 19:20.401
It was awful.

19:20.403 --> 19:23.338
He was attacked.

19:23.340 --> 19:25.740
- Shot to death.
- They know who did it?

19:25.742 --> 19:27.742
Police said it looked like a drug killing,

19:27.744 --> 19:29.577
some trash from over the border,

19:29.579 --> 19:30.762
but never caught them.

19:30.764 --> 19:32.680
Trent was a bank loan officer.

19:32.682 --> 19:35.600
Is it possible he got caught up
in money laundering?

19:35.602 --> 19:37.051
No, he was a good man.

19:37.053 --> 19:39.420
It was just a mistake.

19:39.422 --> 19:41.439
How long did he know Hanna Frey?

19:41.441 --> 19:44.692
Hanna?
He didn't.

19:44.694 --> 19:47.312
Then how do you explain this?

19:47.314 --> 19:49.314
He signed for a bank account in her name

19:49.316 --> 19:51.199
two years after she disappeared.

19:51.201 --> 19:53.401
This must be some kind of mistake.

19:53.403 --> 19:54.769
Yeah, just like his murder.

19:54.771 --> 19:56.251
You mind if we look around the place?

19:56.252 --> 19:59.290
Yes, I do.
You need to leave now.

20:12.554 --> 20:14.822
Carter!

20:17.960 --> 20:19.961
That 911 call.

20:19.963 --> 20:22.063
The witness who saw Hanna
get into the car...

20:22.065 --> 20:23.398
there was a license plate.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.066
Hold on.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.935
"Caller. It's about Hanna,

20:26.937 --> 20:28.186
the girl who's gone missing."

20:28.188 --> 20:30.521
I think I saw her get into a car

20:30.523 --> 20:31.940
outside the library.

20:31.942 --> 20:34.575
"The operator asked about the make of car,

20:34.577 --> 20:37.028
but the only thing the caller can remember

20:37.030 --> 20:41.582
is the license plate...
925 ESK".

20:41.584 --> 20:43.618
925 EFK.

20:43.620 --> 20:47.922
- The caller got one digit wrong.
- Or the operator did.

20:47.924 --> 20:49.207
Are we saying this is the car?

20:49.209 --> 20:51.876
Trent Russell kidnapped Hanna Frey?

20:51.878 --> 20:54.762
Maybe... maybe Russell took her,
but she escaped.

20:54.764 --> 20:56.514
She got her revenge.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.165
How can say that?

20:58.167 --> 21:00.301
Because of the bank account
in Russell's name.

21:00.303 --> 21:02.837
It's how Root works.
She set him up.

21:02.839 --> 21:05.273
She stole 100 grand from a drug dealer.

21:05.275 --> 21:06.975
When he found out it was missing,

21:06.977 --> 21:09.444
the person he went after was Russell.

21:09.446 --> 21:11.612
Russell denies it, but it's useless.

21:11.614 --> 21:12.930
His name is on the account.

21:12.932 --> 21:14.412
The only other name is that of a girl

21:14.413 --> 21:16.567
who's been dead for two years.

21:16.569 --> 21:17.952
He has to be lying.

21:17.954 --> 21:19.120
Please, please!

21:19.122 --> 21:20.371
So the man who kidnapped Hanna

21:20.373 --> 21:22.957
gets gunned down in a parking lot.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.659
And his victim is in the wind,

21:24.661 --> 21:26.544
100 grand the richer.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.196
It's Root.
It has to be Root.

21:29.198 --> 21:30.531
We need to search that house.

21:30.533 --> 21:32.216
We need to call the Sheriff.

21:32.218 --> 21:35.203
We need to handle this
the right way, John.

21:35.205 --> 21:37.371
She'll come back soon.

21:37.373 --> 21:40.758
I know you're reluctant
to trust me... you don't know me...

21:40.760 --> 21:43.277
I do know who you are,
Mr. Weeks.

21:43.279 --> 21:45.880
You tried to hack the machine.

21:45.882 --> 21:49.317
I certainly tried.
It was my job.

21:49.319 --> 21:51.159
I had to test its limits,
see if it was safe.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.560
But in all of our crisis scenarios,

21:52.561 --> 21:56.657
we never envisioned this.

21:56.659 --> 21:58.826
That someone would get to one of us.

21:58.828 --> 22:01.829
She won't get to the machine through me.

22:01.831 --> 22:05.833
But you must see that
if you don't help me get free,

22:05.835 --> 22:07.919
we will lose the machine.

22:12.007 --> 22:14.075
What can I do?

22:14.077 --> 22:17.845
The knife.

22:17.847 --> 22:21.032
Try to push it to me.

23:23.495 --> 23:24.529
Stop.

23:24.531 --> 23:26.414
- Stop it!
- Don't worry!

23:26.416 --> 23:29.534
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill her.

23:29.536 --> 23:32.019
At least not until I've
found out what she knows.

23:35.340 --> 23:41.162
So...
Ingram's little IT guy.

23:41.164 --> 23:45.666
We always suspected the idiot in the tux

23:45.668 --> 23:48.836
couldn't have done it on his own.

23:48.838 --> 23:50.371
What do you want?

23:53.442 --> 23:57.361
I want to know what you know.

24:26.855 --> 24:30.391
John.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.427
<i>Flowers For Algernon.</i>

24:33.429 --> 24:36.647
The book Hanna checked out
that night at the library.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.517
16 copies hidden in your bedroom.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.052
Where'd you get 'em?

24:41.054 --> 24:45.556
They just come...

24:45.558 --> 24:47.174
every year.

24:47.176 --> 24:49.543
Every year on the same date.

24:49.545 --> 24:52.413
- What date?
- April 15th.

24:52.415 --> 24:54.548
The day Hanna disappeared.

24:54.550 --> 24:56.334
They just arrive
from all over the country.

24:56.336 --> 24:58.002
No note, no sender.

24:58.004 --> 25:00.988
Like someone just wants to be cruel.

25:03.342 --> 25:04.725
Carter.

25:04.727 --> 25:07.795
The most recent book did have something.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.014
I'm gonna find out who bought it.

25:10.016 --> 25:12.650
You stay here.

25:13.935 --> 25:17.021
She's not done yet.

25:17.023 --> 25:21.492
She really sent me over the edge.

25:21.494 --> 25:22.910
So what's your plan,
Mr. Weeks?

25:22.912 --> 25:25.663
Tidy this up, get some real experts

25:25.665 --> 25:26.997
to question this bitch.

25:26.999 --> 25:29.417
But since anonymity means a lot to you,

25:29.419 --> 25:33.204
and because you helped me,
I'm gonna let you go

25:33.206 --> 25:35.689
wherever you want.

25:35.691 --> 25:37.157
Just one more question.

25:37.159 --> 25:38.592
Can she get to it?

25:38.594 --> 25:40.694
I need to know if it's safe.

25:40.696 --> 25:44.682
You are the one man who can tell me.

25:46.351 --> 25:50.321
Please.

25:50.323 --> 25:53.774
It cannot be altered remotely.

25:53.776 --> 25:55.526
If anyone wanted to change anything,

25:55.528 --> 25:59.029
they'd have to have
physical access to the servers?

25:59.031 --> 26:01.332
That's right.

26:01.334 --> 26:03.851
So if the location is hidden,

26:03.853 --> 26:07.455
the machine is safe.

26:09.958 --> 26:12.626
That's all I need.

26:15.046 --> 26:19.550
It's been an honor
to meet you... at last.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.181
What did I say, Harold?

26:34.183 --> 26:37.084
Bad code.

26:41.606 --> 26:42.907
Hey, here he comes.

26:42.909 --> 26:44.608
Heard you were staying here, buddy.

26:44.610 --> 26:46.911
- Not now, fellas.
- Think it's time for a rematch.

26:46.913 --> 26:49.830
Don't think you're gonna
sucker punch me again.

27:11.753 --> 27:15.105
This is Detective Stills, NYPD Homicide.

27:15.107 --> 27:16.427
I'm calling about a book you sold

27:16.428 --> 27:17.925
at the beginning of April,

27:17.927 --> 27:19.643
<i>Flowers For Algernon.</i>

27:19.645 --> 27:21.529
I need to trace the buyer.

27:21.531 --> 27:22.763
911, what is your emergency?

27:22.765 --> 27:24.565
It's about Hanna,

27:24.567 --> 27:26.317
the girl who's gone missing.

27:26.319 --> 27:29.653
I think I saw her get into a car
outside the library.

27:29.655 --> 27:30.905
What sort of car?

27:30.907 --> 27:33.357
I don't know.
It was a dark car.

27:33.359 --> 27:35.693
Do you remember anything else?

27:35.695 --> 27:37.394
Yes, the license plate.

27:37.396 --> 27:40.297
925 EFK.

27:40.299 --> 27:42.282
It goes on.
The girl was asked

27:42.284 --> 27:43.584
but wouldn't give her name.

27:43.586 --> 27:46.387
Then she hung up.

27:46.389 --> 27:50.574
Barb knows who it is...
don't you?

27:50.576 --> 27:54.512
It's Sam Groves.

27:54.514 --> 27:57.948
She was in the library
that night with Hanna.

28:00.151 --> 28:02.903
She was friends with Hanna?

28:02.905 --> 28:04.738
Hanna looked out for her.

28:07.443 --> 28:10.528
- <i>Flowers For Algernon.</i>
- You should read it.

28:10.530 --> 28:14.582
It's awesome.

28:16.619 --> 28:19.703
Damn it.
Death by dysentery again.

28:19.705 --> 28:21.956
That game's so dumb, Hanna.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.924
I don't see why you play it.

28:23.926 --> 28:26.093
'Cause I'm gonna get to Oregon.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.662
The library will be closing
in ten minutes.

28:28.664 --> 28:32.383
Bring any books you'd like
to check out to the counter.

28:32.385 --> 28:35.519
- See ya.
- Bye.

28:35.521 --> 28:38.606
Sam was 12.
Funny kid.

28:38.608 --> 28:41.141
Lived with her mom outside town.

28:41.143 --> 28:42.393
Mom wasn't well.

28:42.395 --> 28:44.061
I guess that's why

28:44.063 --> 28:45.946
she always hung around the library.

28:45.948 --> 28:47.781
Why are you sure it was Sam made the call?

28:47.783 --> 28:49.083
There were other girls there.

28:49.085 --> 28:52.703
- It was Sam.
- How do you know?

28:52.705 --> 28:55.522
Because she told me the same thing.

28:59.077 --> 29:01.745
She said she saw Hanna get into a car.

29:01.747 --> 29:05.299
Barb, why didn't you tell me?

29:05.301 --> 29:09.386
Because Sam saw who was in the car.

29:09.388 --> 29:11.855
And she told you, didn't she?

29:11.857 --> 29:15.593
She said...

29:15.595 --> 29:17.878
she thought
it was Mr. Russell.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.681
Why in the hell didn't you say anything?

29:20.683 --> 29:25.052
I did.
I did say something...

29:25.054 --> 29:26.570
to her.

29:26.572 --> 29:29.156
I told her she was a nasty,
attention-seeking brat,

29:29.158 --> 29:31.526
and I couldn't believe she'd think

29:31.527 --> 29:33.727
such a terrible thing
about somebody like Mr. Russell,

29:33.729 --> 29:36.614
who'd done so much for this town

29:36.616 --> 29:38.565
and the library and all the children.

29:38.567 --> 29:44.071
And then I told her to keep
her lying little mouth shut.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.773
Why?

29:47.459 --> 29:51.595
Because I was in love with Trent Russell,

29:51.597 --> 29:54.965
and I couldn't believe
he'd do such a thing.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.251
What do you believe now?

30:06.194 --> 30:08.929
The patio?

30:08.931 --> 30:11.949
He redid it,

30:11.951 --> 30:15.819
two weeks after Hanna disappeared.

30:15.821 --> 30:19.206
Yes, this is Detective Stills, NYPD,

30:19.208 --> 30:21.942
calling in connection
to a missing-child case.

30:21.944 --> 30:23.994
A transfer was made
from an account at your bank

30:23.996 --> 30:26.630
to a bookstore in Seattle.

30:26.632 --> 30:29.500
Account name was Von Neumann.

30:29.502 --> 30:32.219
Last four digits, 4253.

30:33.255 --> 30:35.339
Hey, buddy, no trouble.

30:35.341 --> 30:37.391
We just need to get our stuff, you hear?

30:37.393 --> 30:39.292
- Police business.
- Whoa, whoa. We're good.

30:39.294 --> 30:41.795
Yes, I'm here.

30:45.466 --> 30:47.484
Found something.

30:57.696 --> 30:59.830
Same book.

31:05.070 --> 31:06.670
Yes, I need to check for recent activity

31:06.671 --> 31:09.456
on a credit card in the name of Dyson.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.210
Gas station in Relton, Maryland?

31:13.212 --> 31:15.713
Just after 4:00 AM.

31:15.715 --> 31:20.851
About three hours ago.

31:20.853 --> 31:22.936
Gotcha.

31:22.938 --> 31:24.504
You knew I'd help him, didn't you?

31:24.506 --> 31:26.557
You let him beat you up, take your gun...

31:26.559 --> 31:28.158
you planned the whole thing.

31:30.862 --> 31:33.847
That's who you gave your machine to.

31:33.849 --> 31:39.703
Violent and predictable people.

31:39.705 --> 31:42.072
But you must see I'm on your side.

31:42.074 --> 31:45.409
- I'm not on any side.
- You know what I mean.

31:45.411 --> 31:49.747
I am the best friend, the best support,

31:49.749 --> 31:54.017
the best partner you will ever have.

31:54.019 --> 31:57.304
And definitely the most fun.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.606
No.

31:59.608 --> 32:02.876
You're worse than Weeks.
You're worse than all of them.

32:02.878 --> 32:05.045
I'd rather die than give you the machine,

32:05.047 --> 32:06.647
so please kill me now.

32:06.649 --> 32:09.382
At least I won't have
to listen to you anymore.

32:11.836 --> 32:14.705
You're tired...

32:14.707 --> 32:19.693
and I'm bloody.

32:19.695 --> 32:21.528
I'm gonna go clean up.

32:27.568 --> 32:30.170
Carter, you can keep the rental.

32:30.172 --> 32:32.239
Guys are lending me a truck.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.241
Why is there a crossbow on the bed?

32:34.243 --> 32:35.843
Long story, but we're friends now.

32:35.845 --> 32:37.925
Gotta go. Got a line
on a private jet in Galveston.

32:37.926 --> 32:41.548
- Where are you going?
- Back East. Look...

32:41.550 --> 32:44.184
this book led us to a bookstore,

32:44.186 --> 32:46.470
to a bank, to a bank,
to a bank, to a credit card,

32:46.472 --> 32:48.972
which was used in Maryland
about three hours ago.

32:48.974 --> 32:51.191
It's Root.
Hanna is Root.

32:51.193 --> 32:53.060
She's alive, and I know where she is.

32:53.062 --> 32:55.445
She's not Hanna.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.099
Hanna's in the ground, John.

32:59.101 --> 33:00.484
She's dead.

33:00.486 --> 33:03.570
She never did get away from Russell.

33:03.572 --> 33:06.206
Then who'd do this?

33:06.208 --> 33:08.425
Who sent the books, got Russell killed?

33:14.799 --> 33:17.000
Hanna's father gave it to me.

33:17.002 --> 33:20.220
Her name's Sam Groves.
She was Hanna's friend.

33:20.222 --> 33:23.623
She saw Hanna get
into Russell's car that night.

33:23.625 --> 33:26.459
She told Barb, called 911,

33:26.461 --> 33:28.295
but nobody would listen.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.462
Where is she now?

33:29.464 --> 33:30.681
Only child.

33:30.683 --> 33:32.632
Her mother died about ten years ago.

33:32.634 --> 33:36.303
So Sam left town,
was never heard from again.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.907
If anybody's Root, it's gotta be her.

33:39.909 --> 33:43.076
Then she's the one who took Finch.

33:43.078 --> 33:46.296
I know where she is.
I'm going after her.

34:13.705 --> 34:16.949
_

34:53.347 --> 34:56.049
Who is this guy?

34:59.220 --> 35:00.954
Looks like I found Corwin's hideaway.

35:00.956 --> 35:03.090
Hey, it worked.
How do you say that in Dutch?

35:03.092 --> 35:04.457
Nothing here.

35:04.459 --> 35:06.343
'Cause they beat you to it, smart guy.

35:06.345 --> 35:08.211
Forget it, we got a bigger problem.

35:08.213 --> 35:10.914
Denton Weeks...
he's disappeared.

35:10.916 --> 35:12.516
He's not answering any of his phones.

35:12.518 --> 35:13.884
You got any leads?

35:13.886 --> 35:16.653
It seems weeks had a woman on the side.

35:16.655 --> 35:18.855
- Get down.
- Julie Davenport.

35:18.857 --> 35:21.658
Apparently, they used to
sneak off to her love shack

35:21.660 --> 35:23.660
outside of DC.

35:23.662 --> 35:25.579
Just find it.

35:26.697 --> 35:31.118
Sorry I took so long.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.253
A mild sedative.

35:33.255 --> 35:36.489
I apologize, but I need you to be

35:36.491 --> 35:38.992
a little more...

35:38.994 --> 35:41.495
amenable.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.334
Well, well, it seems I underestimated

35:48.336 --> 35:49.569
your knuckle-dragging friend.

35:49.571 --> 35:53.073
How he got there I do not know.

35:54.593 --> 35:56.693
Did the machine help him, do you think?

35:56.695 --> 36:01.398
Something for us to discuss
on our journey.

36:03.367 --> 36:05.118
I hope you like trains.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.586
Come on, Harold.

36:30.044 --> 36:32.762
One more question,
and then I'll leave you alone.

36:32.764 --> 36:35.065
Where's the machine?

36:39.720 --> 36:43.389
This time, it is loaded.

36:45.110 --> 36:47.077
Now, where did you move the machine?

36:47.079 --> 36:52.916
I'm telling you, I don't know.

36:52.918 --> 36:55.418
Wait.
July 12, 2009,

36:55.420 --> 36:57.170
it was boxed up and put on a train.

36:57.172 --> 36:59.372
With that amount of servers,
of course it was a train.

36:59.373 --> 37:01.925
- But a train to where?
- It started in Des Moines.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.628
Then it was transferred
to Union Pacific railway,

37:04.630 --> 37:07.514
bound for Salt Lake City.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.599
And that's all I know.

37:09.601 --> 37:13.019
That's a start.

37:13.021 --> 37:16.223
You have no idea what you're getting into.

37:24.950 --> 37:27.284
Harold...

37:27.286 --> 37:31.037
did you think I'd forget
to disconnect the phones?

37:33.991 --> 37:35.742
Off we go.

37:38.212 --> 37:42.082
I just landed in Maryland.
I'm at a gas station.

37:42.084 --> 37:43.750
She was here this morning.

37:43.752 --> 37:45.352
I've been trying to reach you for hours.

37:45.353 --> 37:47.254
Have you got something, Fusco?

37:47.256 --> 37:48.955
I think the broad who took your friend

37:48.957 --> 37:51.157
is also going after a guy
by the name of Denton Weeks,

37:51.158 --> 37:52.998
who's in the same type
of government business

37:52.999 --> 37:54.961
as Corwin was, and he's missing.

37:54.963 --> 37:57.264
The feds are flying around
trying to find him.

37:57.266 --> 37:58.648
You know where they're looking?

37:58.650 --> 38:00.016
Apparently, he's got a girlfriend

38:00.018 --> 38:01.601
who's got a cottage outside of DC.

38:01.603 --> 38:03.737
All I got is a name...
Julie Davenport.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.189
Search property records
in Relton, Maryland,

38:06.191 --> 38:07.640
for a Julie Davenport.

38:17.501 --> 38:21.171
I just want to see
if the train's on time, Harold.

38:25.710 --> 38:28.762
Can I remind you of our deal?

38:28.764 --> 38:34.017
Try anything, innocent people get hurt.

38:38.307 --> 38:41.508
The express train with direct
service to Washington, DC.

38:41.510 --> 38:45.378
Will be now departing from track 12.

39:16.511 --> 39:19.929
Tap code. Finch...
Really?

39:31.942 --> 39:34.361
Train station.

39:36.414 --> 39:38.415
The outbound train with direct service

39:38.417 --> 39:40.250
from Baltimore to Salt Lake City

39:40.252 --> 39:43.503
will be departing from track seven.

39:43.505 --> 39:46.906
You'll like the West, Harold.

39:46.908 --> 39:50.293
Fewer people, bigger skies.

39:50.295 --> 39:51.594
More space to think.

39:51.596 --> 39:53.963
We apologize for any inconvenience.

40:01.189 --> 40:02.972
How did he find us?

40:02.974 --> 40:06.726
Because you're wrong.
He proves you're wrong.

40:09.730 --> 40:12.265
Not all humans are bad code.

40:12.267 --> 40:14.784
You helped him.

40:14.786 --> 40:18.738
I told you what would happen
if you tried to get away.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.657
Excuse me, sir.

40:28.667 --> 40:31.551
Can I help you, ma'am?

40:35.339 --> 40:37.390
Help!

40:37.392 --> 40:38.641
Shooters!

40:39.811 --> 40:41.728
Hey!

40:46.151 --> 40:48.318
Don't move.
Don't move.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.236
Am I hit?

40:50.238 --> 40:52.739
I don't think so.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.657
Sorry it took so long.

40:56.193 --> 40:58.945
I really didn't intend for you

40:58.947 --> 41:01.114
to come and find me,
Mr. Reese.

41:01.116 --> 41:03.700
There are other people
that need your help.

41:03.702 --> 41:05.702
Well, you saved my life
once or twice, Harold.

41:05.704 --> 41:09.706
Seemed only fair I return the favor.

41:17.214 --> 41:18.548
Hey.

41:18.550 --> 41:21.134
Hey, yourself.
Where's the dog?

41:21.136 --> 41:23.336
Wonderboy came and took him.

41:24.856 --> 41:27.407
So we got our friend
with the glasses back?

41:27.409 --> 41:30.009
Yeah, we did.

41:31.729 --> 41:32.996
Buy you a drink?

41:32.998 --> 41:35.432
Long as it don't have egg in it.

41:49.296 --> 41:52.532
Harold, meet Bear.

41:52.534 --> 41:54.454
Unfortunately, my apartment
has a strict policy

41:54.455 --> 41:55.585
regarding dogs.

41:55.587 --> 41:56.719
I have a strict policy

41:56.721 --> 41:58.905
regarding rare first editions.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.224
Namely, don't eat them.

42:01.226 --> 42:04.410
Bear, <i>laat vallen.</i>

42:07.264 --> 42:10.767
Asimov.

42:10.769 --> 42:14.053
He has expensive taste.

42:14.055 --> 42:17.474
I'm sure we'll get along.

42:17.476 --> 42:20.643
Mr. Reese.

42:20.645 --> 42:23.062
I owe you a debt.

42:30.404 --> 42:32.839
Is this a bad time, John?

42:34.608 --> 42:36.059
I wanted to thank you...

42:36.061 --> 42:39.963
for finding my friend Hanna...

42:39.965 --> 42:44.350
giving her a proper burial.

42:44.352 --> 42:47.053
I won't forget it.

42:50.941 --> 42:55.761
Come near us again, and you will be sorry.

42:55.763 --> 42:59.782
I don't think so.

42:59.784 --> 43:03.203
Tell Harold I'll be in touch
when I'm ready.

43:09.627 --> 43:11.878
Easy, easy.

43:13.615 --> 43:16.966
It's Denton Weeks.

43:16.968 --> 43:20.053
Somebody got to him.
