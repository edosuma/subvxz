00:08.551 --> 00:11.051
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.473
I just got married,
just moved to a small town,

00:15.474 --> 00:17.517
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.018
I might be just like you.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.397
Except from the time
that I was a little girl,

00:22.398 --> 00:25.400
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.859
It's all right, honey.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.362
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

00:29.363 --> 00:30.863
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:32.949
<i>because they have
unfinished business with the living.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.670
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:40.389
To tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.934
- Breakfast?
- That's not funny.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.353
Poor little guy crashed into the window.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.688
Sorry.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.065
A 16-hour shift
can wreak havoc on your empathy.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.775
Look at how beautiful he is.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.610
I feel terrible.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.945
Tell you what. I wake up later,

01:52.946 --> 01:54.947
we'll give him a proper burial?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.448
Sorry.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.661
Hey, you don't see
a spirit or anything, do you?

02:00.662 --> 02:01.995
- No.
- See?

02:01.996 --> 02:05.626
Crossed over and everything.
Happy, hon?

02:07.752 --> 02:10.252
Bye.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.175
Oh, no. Somebody slept in late.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.052
Yeah. Andrea opened today.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.262
Hey, you want some eggs?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.264
No, I'll just have some juice.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.224
I took the new guy out
to breakfast this morning.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.558
Oh, how's that going?

02:23.559 --> 02:25.560
Hey, what can I say?
He's new, he's green.

02:25.561 --> 02:28.061
He wants to see blood.

02:29.273 --> 02:32.442
Great. Another household appliance
choosing a life of crime.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.902
Why does this happen?

02:33.903 --> 02:35.987
This is how it ends.

02:35.988 --> 02:38.073
We'll just leave it.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.033
I'm just gonna go to bed.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.409
I have to be back at work at 2:00.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.537
I could stick a frozen chunk
of bacon in your mouth

02:43.538 --> 02:46.623
and let it melt while you're sleeping.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.999
Good night.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.390
Morning, good evening, whatever it is.

03:14.985 --> 03:18.696
<i>There"s something wrong.
It"s too cold in here.</i>

03:18.697 --> 03:21.197
<i>Please!</i>

03:50.562 --> 03:53.062
<i>Can you see us?</i>

04:39.117 --> 04:42.036
When you're out here, that usually
means there's something in there.

04:42.037 --> 04:43.371
No, no, no.

04:43.372 --> 04:45.540
Tiffany Cogan said she's gonna retire

04:45.541 --> 04:47.166
and close the bakery
right next door to us.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.210
No more apple cobblers?
That's a good thing?

04:49.211 --> 04:51.504
It means we can expand.
Think about it.

04:51.505 --> 04:54.090
We can knock down the wall
in the middle and combine the fronts.

04:54.091 --> 04:55.424
Expand?

04:55.425 --> 04:57.385
I thought we were just
settling into what we have.

04:57.386 --> 04:58.761
Oh, come on, it'll be great.

04:58.762 --> 05:00.554
Think about all the extra floor space.

05:00.555 --> 05:01.972
We could take
much bigger consignments.

05:01.973 --> 05:04.975
You really have a lot
of free time on your hands.

05:04.976 --> 05:07.436
I really do.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.480
You know, my sensitive poet

05:09.481 --> 05:12.566
is touring the deep south this week.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.026
- What?
- Sorry.

05:14.027 --> 05:15.945
It's just hard to put
those images together.

05:15.946 --> 05:19.199
Ashton, poetry slam, Alabama.

05:20.242 --> 05:22.742
I'm okay now.

05:24.704 --> 05:26.914
- What?
- Do you see that?

05:26.915 --> 05:28.249
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.376
There is something really weird
going on with the AC

05:30.377 --> 05:32.086
and it was, like, 25 degrees in there

05:32.087 --> 05:33.545
when I came in
to open up this morning.

05:33.546 --> 05:34.755
Wow, we should call them.

05:34.756 --> 05:36.006
I already called the repair guy

05:36.007 --> 05:38.884
and he promises to be here
within the year.

05:38.885 --> 05:41.762
Hey, I made this amazing sketch,
so let me come show you.

05:41.763 --> 05:44.390
Yeah, I don't feel like going to work yet.

05:44.391 --> 05:45.891
You okay?

05:45.892 --> 05:48.902
Yeah. I don't know. It's just...

05:49.938 --> 05:51.438
It's been a weird day so far.

05:51.439 --> 05:52.648
Do you want some coffee?

05:52.649 --> 05:55.817
No. I don't need to be any more wired.
But you should go, okay?

05:55.818 --> 05:57.444
Well, come with me.

05:57.445 --> 06:00.405
Just stay out of the store, you know,
until they fix the AC.

06:00.406 --> 06:02.532
I'll be fine. I got sweaters
and a snowsuit if I need it.

06:02.533 --> 06:05.033
Hurry back, okay?

06:50.206 --> 06:52.374
- And your biscone.
- Thank you very much.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.666
Thank you.

06:53.667 --> 06:56.167
I know. The usual.

07:17.274 --> 07:19.776
- What can I get you, doll?
- Uh, latte, please.

07:19.777 --> 07:22.277
A latte it is.

07:53.185 --> 07:55.685
Your latte?

07:58.315 --> 07:59.732
Keep the change.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.525
Sure. Next!

08:01.526 --> 08:02.652
Can I get a large?

08:02.653 --> 08:04.737
When are these
repair guys coming? Christmas?

08:04.738 --> 08:08.240
Yeah, I know. I'm about to break up
some furniture and make a fire.

08:08.241 --> 08:09.950
Hey, look at this.

08:09.951 --> 08:12.912
See, what I'm thinking
is that we could leave half a wall here

08:12.913 --> 08:15.998
and then maybe leave
the edges to look like they're serrated?

08:15.999 --> 08:17.958
I think you are really amazing.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.543
Your brother must have
rubbed off on you.

08:19.544 --> 08:21.170
A real estate mogul in the making.

08:21.171 --> 08:23.671
Speaking of my brother,

08:24.341 --> 08:27.092
it's his birthday tomorrow.
Look what I got him.

08:27.093 --> 08:28.677
I know how much he loves watches.

08:28.678 --> 08:30.638
Wow. That's incredible.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.597
Thanks. I'm gonna
give it to him on Saturday.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.807
Why not tomorrow?

08:33.808 --> 08:36.143
He's on some big
business trip overseas,

08:36.144 --> 08:38.645
some huge timeshare deal
or something.

08:38.647 --> 08:40.272
Well, it's great that
you guys are really close.

08:40.273 --> 08:42.066
I wish I had a brother or a sister.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.609
Well, it wasn't always that way.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.487
We did not get along
when we were kids.

08:46.488 --> 08:48.614
We've always been
more different than alike.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.158
Do you know we once
went for two years without speaking?

08:51.159 --> 08:52.701
Really? Why?

08:52.702 --> 08:54.745
It was just...

08:54.746 --> 08:56.830
He was always such a go-getter,
you know, so ambitious,

08:56.831 --> 09:00.125
and I just... I like to lay back
and let things come to me.

09:00.126 --> 09:02.836
We had the most terrible fights.

09:02.837 --> 09:05.505
I once called him a sellout and worse.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.257
Wow. That doesn't sound like you.

09:07.258 --> 09:08.967
Yeah, that's the way it was back then.

09:08.968 --> 09:11.678
He thought I was a rebel and a loser.

09:11.679 --> 09:13.138
Okay. Note to self.

09:13.139 --> 09:16.516
Be grateful that
I don't have angry brothers and sisters.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.518
You know what
the great thing was, though?

09:18.519 --> 09:19.936
He was always there for me,

09:19.937 --> 09:22.064
no matter what kind
of trouble I got into.

09:22.065 --> 09:25.150
He saw that I had some growing up
to do and he was patient with me.

09:25.151 --> 09:27.651
I didn't see it back then,

09:27.737 --> 09:30.071
but now we're best friends.

09:30.072 --> 09:32.572
Look at the inscription.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.621
Do you think it's weird that
I wrote that to my brother?

09:37.622 --> 09:40.122
No.

09:41.209 --> 09:43.849
No. I think it's just right.

09:44.212 --> 09:45.879
You might want to set it
to the right time.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.214
Oh. I thought I did.

09:48.215 --> 09:49.424
That's weird.

09:49.425 --> 09:54.025
What time does it say
on the clock in the square?

10:05.608 --> 10:07.776
Melinda?

10:07.777 --> 10:09.486
Sorry. Yeah.

10:09.487 --> 10:11.779
Um, it says 25 after 2:00.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.980
Wow. Must not have wound it enough.

10:16.285 --> 10:19.355
So, want to talk about architects?

10:24.043 --> 10:25.793
I tried so hard to work in the city, man,

10:25.794 --> 10:27.170
but the waiting list, forget it.

10:27.171 --> 10:28.755
Why the city?

10:28.756 --> 10:29.881
Are you kidding me?

10:29.882 --> 10:33.301
'Cause I don't want less than,
you know, like, 10 calls a night.

10:33.302 --> 10:35.219
- You used to work in the city, right?
- Yep.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.055
You must have seen some stuff, huh?

10:37.056 --> 10:38.848
What do you want from this job, John?

10:38.849 --> 10:41.059
To do good. Help people, save lives.

10:41.060 --> 10:42.643
And to drive that bad boy real fast.

10:42.644 --> 10:45.980
Right. That's why
the keys are gonna stay in my pocket.

10:45.981 --> 10:47.690
What's your background?

10:47.691 --> 10:49.317
Two years med school at Columbia.

10:49.318 --> 10:52.278
Columbia. Nice.
How about the real worid?

10:52.279 --> 10:54.739
Oh, I did some time in the ER. Loved it.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.782
Life and death,
ticking clock, the whole thing.

10:56.783 --> 10:57.950
So I wanted more of that

10:57.951 --> 11:00.661
and less classroom lectures
in chemistry, so I trained for this.

11:00.662 --> 11:04.290
See, I think this is gonna
be more immediate.

11:04.291 --> 11:06.083
Well, right now, immediately,

11:06.084 --> 11:08.169
we need to check
the tyre pressure and the oil.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.295
Your heart racing yet?

11:09.296 --> 11:11.756
That's what I mean. I can't believe
they sent me to a place like this.

11:11.757 --> 11:13.799
I'm on the job two days.
So far I've gone on one call

11:13.800 --> 11:15.468
to help a lady
who couldn't find her way home.

11:15.469 --> 11:17.303
Feel like you're wasting your time?

11:17.304 --> 11:19.764
That's not what I'm saying. It's just...

11:19.765 --> 11:20.890
Whoa.

11:20.891 --> 11:22.516
I'd like to help her find her way home.

11:22.517 --> 11:23.684
Stand down, Sparky.

11:23.685 --> 11:25.561
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:25.562 --> 11:27.480
John, this is my wife Melinda.

11:27.481 --> 11:30.065
Melinda, this keg of adrenaline
right here is John Gregory,

11:30.066 --> 11:31.442
probationary paramedic.

11:31.443 --> 11:33.068
- Hi.
- Welcome.

11:33.069 --> 11:35.195
Hey. You brought me soup.

11:35.196 --> 11:36.697
Yeah, I thought you could use a visit.

11:36.698 --> 11:40.284
We're gonna take a little break.
Keep an eye on things.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.536
Sure.

11:42.537 --> 11:43.787
That's the new guy?

11:43.788 --> 11:46.540
Yeah. He wants
things to be immediate.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.042
That's why he moved to Grandview?

11:48.043 --> 11:51.045
His point exactly.
Hey, how was your day?

11:51.046 --> 11:52.337
Weird.

11:52.338 --> 11:55.174
What, like ghost weird? Are they back?

11:55.175 --> 11:58.218
No. I mean, there was something
this morning while you were sleeping,

11:58.219 --> 12:00.053
a voice.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.221
What?

12:01.222 --> 12:04.099
Oh, it's just... I can't shake this
feeling of dread, you know,

12:04.100 --> 12:05.976
like something terrible
is gonna happen.

12:05.977 --> 12:07.144
Have you had this before?

12:07.145 --> 12:08.729
No, not really.

12:08.730 --> 12:10.856
There's just a heaviness in the air.

12:10.857 --> 12:12.941
Sure it's not the kitchen vent
at Lento's on the Square?

12:12.942 --> 12:14.651
You know, I am trying
to be serious here.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.152
Too serious.

12:17.697 --> 12:19.448
I don't wanna go home without you.

12:19.449 --> 12:22.117
My shift's almost over.
I'll be home by 10:00.

12:22.118 --> 12:23.410
- Promise?
- Promise.

12:23.411 --> 12:26.121
Unless, of course, the heaviness
in the air slows me down.

12:26.122 --> 12:27.622
Yeah, you're going down, Clancy.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.584
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey,
my chief promised me two days off.

12:30.585 --> 12:33.003
After my shift tomorrow,
we can play a little hooky,

12:33.004 --> 12:35.505
maybe go catch an afternoon movie.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.673
What do you think about that?

12:36.674 --> 12:39.092
Sounds good.

12:39.093 --> 12:42.983
- I better go check on the rookie.
- Yeah.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.660
Well, at least the ghosts are back.

13:46.744 --> 13:49.078
Something's back.
I'm just not sure what.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.873
Oh, oh, oh. We have to keep this pizza.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.040
It has freezer burn.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.876
- What's wrong with freezer burn?
- It makes it taste gross.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.752
- No, no. We can burn it off in the oven.
- No, we won't.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.880
Melinda, you've got to give
a pizza a fighting chance.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.931
Okay, fine. We will save
the pizza Frisbees.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.512
So...

14:06.513 --> 14:08.431
What do they want, these ghosts?

14:08.432 --> 14:10.808
The ghosts want you
to throw out that damn pizza.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.185
Beside that.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.021
I don't think they know what they want.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.940
Well, at least you're seeing them now.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.275
I mean, last week at this time,

14:19.276 --> 14:21.861
you thought you'd lost your gift.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.696
Yeah. You thought I had, too.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.698
I was hoping. Kidding.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.199
You're a liar.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.537
It's just still so quiet out there.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.582
I don't know where they've all gone.
It's like a huge vacuum.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.459
You mean, like Grandview
is a ghost town?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.879
You know what?
I'm gonna spank you and hard.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.089
Stop it.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.710
You know, I wish I could help you more.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.220
I really do.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.721
You do. You listen.

14:51.391 --> 14:56.020
Yeah, and what I'm hearing right now
is that you're scared.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.813
Yeah.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.314
I'm just not sure of what.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.069
<i>You"re the one.</i>

16:57.349 --> 16:59.725
Who are you?

16:59.726 --> 17:03.522
We're so cold.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.858
Who?

17:24.224 --> 17:25.724
See, this is what I'm talking about.

17:25.726 --> 17:28.310
If we had that space next door, we
could build some really cool displays

17:28.311 --> 17:30.812
with trunks like this.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.399
I found a flyer
for this architect over at Village Java

17:33.400 --> 17:37.487
and he's gonna come by later
and take a look, okay?

17:37.488 --> 17:39.614
And then I hope he rips off my clothes

17:39.615 --> 17:43.159
and has his way with me
in the claw foot tub.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.410
What?

17:44.411 --> 17:46.329
Welcome back.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.455
I'm sorry.

17:47.456 --> 17:48.581
Where were you?

17:48.582 --> 17:51.751
I was just thinking
about this little visit I had last night.

17:51.752 --> 17:54.087
So the ghosts haven't
totally abandoned you!

17:54.088 --> 17:56.714
No. I saw the one last night
and heard one yesterday morning.

17:56.715 --> 18:00.593
I just can't figure out why they are here
and the rest are just gone.

18:00.594 --> 18:02.553
Well, can't you just ask them?

18:02.554 --> 18:04.013
It's weird.

18:04.014 --> 18:07.183
It's like they're half in this place
and half in another place.

18:07.184 --> 18:09.684
Like so many men I know.

18:09.686 --> 18:11.354
Sometimes they're talking
in the present tense,

18:11.355 --> 18:13.064
sometimes they're talking
in the past tense.

18:13.065 --> 18:16.400
Now, wait a second. Are these ghosts
that died, like, suddenly or violently?

18:16.401 --> 18:17.777
Is that why they're so confused?

18:17.778 --> 18:19.111
Maybe.

18:19.112 --> 18:22.114
You know, usually I can solve
a haunting pretty quickly.

18:22.115 --> 18:24.158
I mean, the spirits have
something they want to say to me

18:24.159 --> 18:26.577
or a problem that they need solved,
but not these two.

18:26.578 --> 18:29.080
They're not making any sense.
It's like a riddle.

18:29.081 --> 18:30.498
Maybe you're not meant to solve it yet.

18:30.499 --> 18:33.542
I just can't shake the feeling that
it's more important than ever

18:33.543 --> 18:36.343
for me to figure this one out.

18:38.173 --> 18:40.673
Do you hear that?

18:41.301 --> 18:43.801
Hear what?

18:48.767 --> 18:51.267
What?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.497
What? What is it?

19:11.498 --> 19:13.165
Hell if I know.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.666
I'll be right back.

20:00.838 --> 20:02.505
Melinda, this is Charlie Filbert,

20:02.506 --> 20:04.049
the architect that
I was telling you about.

20:04.050 --> 20:06.426
Oh, he's the one
you were hoping would

20:06.427 --> 20:08.595
come by before his lunch.

20:08.596 --> 20:10.430
I love your place.
I walk past all the time.

20:10.431 --> 20:13.391
Well, it's better for us
when people come in, not just by.

20:13.392 --> 20:16.019
Well, it's my loss.
So, you guys want to expand?

20:16.020 --> 20:17.604
- Yes.
- Maybe.

20:17.605 --> 20:19.856
Well, I mean, it's really very simple.

20:19.857 --> 20:21.941
I mean, you've got one, two, three,
four support columns

20:21.942 --> 20:23.109
including the brick

20:23.110 --> 20:27.989
and you could punch
a hole between any and, or all of them.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.950
I mean, your biggest headache's
gonna be getting permits from town.

20:30.951 --> 20:35.246
You know, the planning board's
not exactly business-friendly.

20:35.247 --> 20:37.957
How long would
something like this take?

20:37.958 --> 20:41.419
Charlie, I mean, do you think
that we'd still be able to stay open?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.296
Well, we could do a lot of prep work
on days you're closed,

20:43.297 --> 20:46.841
but you'd probably
have to shut down for a week or so.

20:46.842 --> 20:51.012
Or... Or you could knock the wall down
while we're closed,

20:51.013 --> 20:52.680
and then we could put up
some curtains or something,

20:52.681 --> 20:53.848
and you could just, you know,

20:53.849 --> 20:56.225
keep doing your thing
on the other side. And...

20:56.226 --> 20:59.020
Curtains. You mean,
like plastic sheeting and tarps?

20:59.021 --> 21:01.355
Uh, yeah, that.

21:01.356 --> 21:02.732
Is it always so cold in here?

21:02.733 --> 21:04.942
I'm sorry. You know, we've been
waiting for the workmen forever,

21:04.943 --> 21:07.443
and, in fact,

21:07.529 --> 21:10.573
they were supposed to be here by now.

21:10.574 --> 21:14.620
Damn! It stopped again!
You saw me set it.

21:15.662 --> 21:17.163
What time did it stop?

21:17.164 --> 21:19.582
It went ahead this time. To 10:30.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.959
I'm gonna have
to take you back to the jeweller.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.740
We could replicate this facade.

21:25.964 --> 21:27.340
I don't know if you like it or not,

21:27.341 --> 21:29.550
but you didn't have to put it up anyway.

21:29.551 --> 21:32.961
I mean, you know, it hasn't really...

21:53.408 --> 21:54.658
<i>It"s cold.</i>

21:54.659 --> 21:56.202
I can hear you.

21:56.203 --> 21:59.873
<i>It"s cold in the cabin. We"re all cold.</i>

21:59.998 --> 22:02.751
Where are you? In the woods?

22:03.251 --> 22:04.835
Are you trapped there?

22:04.836 --> 22:07.671
<i>No, something"s wrong.
I have to find the door.</i>

22:07.672 --> 22:10.424
No, no, wait. Tell me who you are.

22:10.425 --> 22:12.925
<i>I have to find the door.</i>

22:17.557 --> 22:20.057
Uh, I was just listening.

22:21.060 --> 22:23.270
For termites.

22:23.271 --> 22:25.771
Cool.

22:44.334 --> 22:47.044
I can't believe you did this.

22:47.045 --> 22:49.880
Yeah, well, you were asleep when I left
and I didn't want you to eat alone.

22:49.881 --> 22:51.840
Breakfast of champions.

22:51.841 --> 22:54.593
You know, they're closing soon,
so enjoy it while you can.

22:54.594 --> 22:57.094
Oh, it's a tragedy.

22:57.764 --> 23:01.254
- Sit down.
- No. I have to get back.

23:01.392 --> 23:04.311
You're really
in a bad place, aren't you?

23:04.312 --> 23:06.438
- That obvious?
- That's that smile.

23:06.439 --> 23:08.315
It's the "I'm trying
to make it seem like everything's great

23:08.316 --> 23:09.774
"when I'm really dying inside.
Help!" smile.

23:09.775 --> 23:11.902
It's disgusting how well you know me.

23:11.903 --> 23:13.403
Better than you think.

23:13.404 --> 23:15.904
I added the "Help."

23:15.906 --> 23:18.366
I just have never really felt like this.

23:18.367 --> 23:23.079
- Like what?
- It's a million different feelings, really.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.833
Not just dread, but I feel like I have to...

23:26.834 --> 23:29.919
Rush, you know?
Like maybe there's not enough time.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.171
Time to what?

23:31.172 --> 23:32.922
To live.

23:32.923 --> 23:34.674
What are you saying?

23:34.675 --> 23:39.775
No, don't be worried.
I'm just telling you how I feel.

23:40.514 --> 23:44.504
I look at this room and it is so beautiful.

23:45.394 --> 23:47.687
The colour, the light.

23:47.688 --> 23:50.188
You.

23:51.108 --> 23:54.110
And I feel like we don't spend
enough time in this room.

23:54.111 --> 23:56.863
We don't spend enough time together.

23:56.864 --> 23:59.032
Like maybe we're working too hard.

23:59.033 --> 24:04.328
Just rushing through our lives
instead of living our lives.

24:04.329 --> 24:06.414
Maybe it's too late to even matter.

24:06.415 --> 24:08.374
No.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.875
Hey.

24:11.044 --> 24:14.672
Everything we do,
we're doing for a reason,

24:14.673 --> 24:15.923
doing it for the future.

24:15.924 --> 24:18.884
Yeah, that's the point, I think.

24:18.886 --> 24:21.679
What are we doing for the now?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.639
Well, I'm holding you now.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.808
I love you right now.
What else matters?

24:25.809 --> 24:28.853
Oh, just forget about it.
I am talking crazy.

24:28.854 --> 24:29.979
What did I say?

24:29.980 --> 24:32.064
Don't even worry about it.

24:32.065 --> 24:34.734
I don't really get it, either.

24:34.735 --> 24:39.515
I have to get back to work.
I'll talk to you soon.

24:45.370 --> 24:47.121
Where is your sense of adventure?

24:47.122 --> 24:49.457
Underneath my sense
of biting off more than we can chew.

24:49.458 --> 24:50.666
Thank you.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.042
Well, I just don't know
if this is the right time.

24:52.043 --> 24:55.254
Why not? We'll get great tax breaks
for property improvement.

24:55.255 --> 24:58.382
Yeah, but how can we stay in business
with them knocking down our walls?

24:58.383 --> 24:59.592
I mean, the dust alone.

24:59.593 --> 25:01.552
Well, I mean, it'll be a challenge, yeah.

25:01.553 --> 25:02.803
It'll be an adjustment.

25:02.804 --> 25:04.722
But we'll do it and it will be so worth it.

25:04.723 --> 25:05.848
I don't know.

25:05.849 --> 25:08.017
Hey, you gotta spend money
to make money.

25:08.018 --> 25:09.310
That's the first rule of business.

25:09.311 --> 25:13.605
Look, somehow I just feel like,
deep down, we might be tempting fate.

25:13.606 --> 25:15.024
You know, to make a big move like this,

25:15.025 --> 25:17.693
commit to so much money
when we don't know if we can absorb it.

25:17.694 --> 25:19.153
What if it backfires?

25:19.154 --> 25:21.488
Okay, you know that's
classic scarcity mentality.

25:21.489 --> 25:22.865
Yeah. Guilty.

25:22.866 --> 25:25.868
Let me just get Charlie over here, okay,
and he can show you his plans

25:25.869 --> 25:27.870
and walk you through
how we would do things.

25:27.871 --> 25:30.205
And then, if it's still too scary,
we can wait.

25:30.206 --> 25:32.541
Whoa, I am not scared. I'm cautious.

25:32.542 --> 25:34.418
Whatever you say.
And can we please not let Charlie

25:34.419 --> 25:36.378
see you listening to the walls this time?

25:36.379 --> 25:37.963
Good point.

25:37.964 --> 25:40.382
I don't know how much more
of this cold I can take.

25:40.383 --> 25:43.213
I called the repair guys again.

26:11.664 --> 26:13.582
What do you want?

26:13.583 --> 26:16.863
The captain goes down with the ship.

26:17.795 --> 26:20.295
I don't understand.

26:22.216 --> 26:23.883
We're all asleep.

26:23.884 --> 26:26.971
We? Who's with you?

26:27.513 --> 26:31.083
No one yet. They're all still sleeping.

26:32.101 --> 26:34.601
Where are you?

26:37.273 --> 26:39.773
We're close.

26:52.971 --> 26:54.972
A uniform?

26:54.973 --> 26:57.307
I'm not sure what kind but not military.

26:57.308 --> 26:59.518
He said, "A captain
goes down with the ship."

26:59.519 --> 27:00.769
Are we talking about a boat?

27:00.770 --> 27:02.312
I think he was a pilot.

27:02.313 --> 27:05.190
It's the only thing that makes sense
with the noises that I'm hearing, and...

27:05.191 --> 27:07.317
If there was a plane crash,
wouldn't we have heard about it?

27:07.318 --> 27:08.944
Unless it happened a long time ago.

27:08.945 --> 27:11.738
Or it happened a little while ago
and it's not on the news yet.

27:11.739 --> 27:13.824
He said he was close.

27:13.825 --> 27:16.451
What about these
ghosts that keep rattling your doors?

27:16.452 --> 27:19.579
I don't know.
Someone else from the flight?

27:19.580 --> 27:24.080
If it is a plane,
something went seriously wrong.

27:24.627 --> 27:26.544
Hey, what's wrong?

27:26.545 --> 27:29.798
My brother is supposed to fly today.

27:29.799 --> 27:32.449
- From where?
- South Africa.

27:32.468 --> 27:33.635
When I spoke to him last,

27:33.636 --> 27:36.346
he was gonna go to Johannesburg
for a couple of days for a...

27:36.347 --> 27:39.577
Some kind of real estate conference.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.768
He wants to be back by tonight.

27:41.769 --> 27:44.104
Andrea, what are the chances?

27:44.105 --> 27:46.356
What the hell is going on?

27:46.357 --> 27:48.857
It went ahead again.

27:52.112 --> 27:54.612
What happened at 10:30?

27:54.698 --> 27:57.198
And where?

28:01.205 --> 28:03.957
So, I'm gonna take
this back to the jeweller.

28:03.958 --> 28:06.458
Take your time.

28:34.530 --> 28:37.030
John! My bag.

28:38.242 --> 28:40.742
Stop him! Check him out!

28:42.329 --> 28:43.871
Okay. Why don't you come
sit over here.

28:43.872 --> 28:46.372
How you doing, sir?

28:47.584 --> 28:49.669
My name's Jim. Are you doing all right?

28:49.670 --> 28:51.879
- I've been better.
- What happened? Can you move?

28:51.880 --> 28:53.005
My hand.

28:53.006 --> 28:54.298
What about your hand?
Can you move it?

28:54.299 --> 28:56.509
It's gone.

28:56.510 --> 28:59.010
- What?
- It came off.

28:59.429 --> 29:01.472
John! John!

29:01.473 --> 29:04.753
- Yeah, what's up?
- Get over here.

29:05.185 --> 29:07.520
The driver's hand's been severed,
okay? We need to find it,

29:07.521 --> 29:09.313
get him to the hospital,
see if they can reattach it.

29:09.314 --> 29:11.690
He's also in shock. I'm going to
treat him. You find the hand.

29:11.691 --> 29:16.741
He said it's over there.
It could be anywhere. Go. Go!

29:20.492 --> 29:22.159
Look at me. Hey.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.660
You're gonna be all right.

29:44.432 --> 29:45.599
Sir?

29:45.600 --> 29:48.810
John! Damn it.
Hey, come here. Officer, come here!

29:48.811 --> 29:50.771
- Keep that on his hand. Go.
- Got it.

29:50.772 --> 29:54.942
Hey, hey, hey!
You all right? What's the matter?

29:54.943 --> 29:58.154
Oh, hey. I got up too fast.

29:59.781 --> 30:01.073
Where's the hand? Where's the hand?

30:01.074 --> 30:03.574
You take it. You take it.

30:09.165 --> 30:12.525
Take him out the passenger side door.

30:53.959 --> 30:57.337
Hey. I was told
to come over here and convince you.

30:57.338 --> 30:58.463
Is this a good time?

30:58.464 --> 31:01.841
Not an easy task, but sure, come on in.

31:01.842 --> 31:05.178
Before I walk out of here, you're gonna
be ready to take over the block.

31:05.179 --> 31:07.972
It's just,
we're still such a new business.

31:07.973 --> 31:09.849
I get it. So am I.

31:09.850 --> 31:12.018
Have you been in Grandview long?

31:12.019 --> 31:15.021
Not really. I was
with a big firm in Chicago.

31:15.022 --> 31:17.940
But my wife's from here.
She was dying to move back.

31:17.941 --> 31:19.567
I took one look, said, "I'm in."

31:19.568 --> 31:22.445
I want my daughter to grow up here.

31:22.446 --> 31:25.114
Would you like
a hot cup of tea, Charlie?

31:25.115 --> 31:27.615
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.036
You know, how old is your daughter?

31:30.037 --> 31:32.537
Ten.

31:42.466 --> 31:43.883
Do you have kids?

31:43.884 --> 31:47.512
No. No, not yet, anyway.

31:48.013 --> 31:51.807
But my husband,
he is chomping at the bit.

31:51.808 --> 31:54.268
Exactly the opposite with us.
I didn't think I'd ever be ready.

31:54.269 --> 31:55.436
Thank you.

31:55.437 --> 31:57.937
My wife couldn't wait.

31:58.315 --> 32:00.232
So how is it, being a parent?

32:00.233 --> 32:01.734
It's great, although I have to admit,

32:01.735 --> 32:03.944
my wife does most of the heavy lifting.

32:03.945 --> 32:06.405
I've always been a bit of a workaholic.

32:06.406 --> 32:09.575
Hence your visit here today
to convince a sceptic.

32:09.576 --> 32:12.161
I'll do anything to snag a new client.

32:12.162 --> 32:16.790
My family's travelling this week,
so I figured, keep extra busy.

32:16.791 --> 32:18.584
They're not flying, are they?

32:18.585 --> 32:21.253
No. They're driving from upstate. Why?

32:21.254 --> 32:23.172
I was just curious.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.758
I hate planes, you know?
All the hassles.

32:25.759 --> 32:27.968
Me, too. I mean, I figure
it's dangerous enough out there

32:27.969 --> 32:29.136
without leaving the ground.

32:29.137 --> 32:31.889
Okay. This is your
new storage room, right?

32:31.890 --> 32:34.390
Here's your front door.

32:34.642 --> 32:36.101
<i>Hi. Catch you at a bad time?</i>

32:36.102 --> 32:38.479
No, no. I'm good now.
I just had a little rookie trouble.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.814
<i>Oh, Mr Adrenaline?</i>

32:40.815 --> 32:42.441
I'll tell you later.

32:42.442 --> 32:44.610
Look, is there any back channel way
of you finding out

32:44.611 --> 32:46.862
if there's been anything
with a plane today?

32:46.863 --> 32:48.363
<i>Anything, liKe a crash?</i>

32:48.364 --> 32:49.865
Yeah, I think so.

32:49.866 --> 32:51.909
Do you know anybody
at the airports or...

32:51.910 --> 32:53.118
Or where?

32:53.119 --> 32:56.788
<i>Oh, I don"t really Know.
L"m thinKing the East Coast.</i>

32:56.789 --> 32:57.956
<i>I checKed the news on the Web,</i>

32:57.957 --> 33:00.626
but there doesn't seem to be anything
coming up for a recent crash.

33:00.627 --> 33:02.169
What about farther back?

33:02.170 --> 33:03.629
<i>I don"t Know.</i>

33:03.630 --> 33:05.797
You know, the more I think about it,
this ghost is so confused,

33:05.798 --> 33:07.924
it really feels like
somebody newly dead.

33:07.925 --> 33:10.052
<i>You Know, they both said
something about being really cold.</i>

33:10.053 --> 33:12.763
Maybe they crashed
in some far away, remote place

33:12.764 --> 33:14.014
and nobody's heard about it yet.

33:14.015 --> 33:16.475
It's possible, but how would they know
to come to me?

33:16.476 --> 33:18.351
Well, that is the $64,000 question,

33:18.352 --> 33:20.353
how do they ever know to come to you?

33:20.354 --> 33:22.022
Can you just make some calls?

33:22.023 --> 33:25.692
<i>Yeah. I will. I just thinK if, you Know,
nothing"s on the Net, then...</i>

33:25.693 --> 33:28.703
I'm gonna have to call you back.

33:29.655 --> 33:33.225
Andrea, I have to go across the street.

33:34.035 --> 33:36.535
Okay.

33:46.464 --> 33:48.964
What are you looking for?

33:50.718 --> 33:53.218
Don't you know?

33:53.262 --> 33:54.804
I thought you knew.

33:54.805 --> 33:56.890
Is it an aeroplane?

33:56.891 --> 33:59.350
Did an aeroplane crash?

33:59.351 --> 34:01.851
I don't know yet.

34:02.354 --> 34:05.148
What was the last thing that you saw?

34:05.149 --> 34:07.275
The sky.

34:07.276 --> 34:09.485
Do you remember anything?

34:09.485 --> 34:12.487
Anything about where you went down?

34:12.489 --> 34:14.407
There's been no crash.

34:14.408 --> 34:16.618
No crash? I don't understand.

34:16.619 --> 34:19.119
We're still flying.

34:19.204 --> 34:21.704
We're still up there.

34:22.498 --> 34:23.750
What?

34:23.751 --> 34:27.031
The captain goes down with the ship.

34:44.804 --> 34:47.304
Sorry!

34:48.641 --> 34:51.226
Excuse me! Excuse me!

34:53.771 --> 34:56.630
- What are you, crazy?
- Sorry!

35:01.237 --> 35:04.614
Charlie, I am so sorry to be rude,
but would you excuse us?

35:04.615 --> 35:06.199
Okay. I need my pencils.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.850
Yeah. We're gonna
send them over later.

35:09.912 --> 35:11.287
Andrea, there's a plane.

35:11.288 --> 35:13.790
It's still in the air.
The pilot is dead. Maybe the crew.

35:13.791 --> 35:15.375
What? How do you know this?

35:15.376 --> 35:17.251
The pilot just told me.

35:17.252 --> 35:19.295
Well, what airline? What flight?

35:19.296 --> 35:21.214
Hey, he was gone before I could ask.

35:21.215 --> 35:22.590
Okay. What do we do?

35:22.591 --> 35:24.550
Calls. The FAA for starters.

35:24.551 --> 35:26.761
Maybe you should try
some of the airports.

35:26.762 --> 35:28.679
And say what?
We're gonna sound like lunatics.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.556
I don't know, okay?
Don't even try explaining.

35:30.557 --> 35:32.767
Just keep telling them
until somebody listens.

35:32.768 --> 35:34.769
Okay, okay.

35:34.770 --> 35:37.772
Yes, hello. I need
the Federal Aviation Administration.

35:37.773 --> 35:40.273
Thank you.

35:42.611 --> 35:45.861
Hello. There is a plane in the air.

35:46.114 --> 35:48.032
No one is flying it.

35:48.033 --> 35:50.493
The pilot is dead and maybe the crew.

35:50.494 --> 35:52.703
Mitch, hi. It's Andrea.

35:52.704 --> 35:55.289
Look, I know...
I know you're on a plane right now,

35:55.290 --> 35:58.667
but can you please just call me
when you land?

35:58.668 --> 36:01.879
There's some really crazy stuff
going on today. I just...

36:01.880 --> 36:03.631
I just really need to know you're safe.

36:03.632 --> 36:06.091
Look, we can talk about
how crazy this sounds later.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.551
I'm just telling you what I know.

36:07.552 --> 36:09.720
I need the number
for Driscoll County Airport...

36:09.721 --> 36:11.680
Please, is there somebody else that I...

36:11.681 --> 36:12.890
- Hello?
- Hello?

36:12.891 --> 36:14.099
Hi. I need to speak...

36:14.100 --> 36:15.226
Damn it!

36:15.227 --> 36:17.186
I need to speak to somebody
about a plane.

36:17.187 --> 36:18.354
There's a plane,
it's over the East Coast.

36:18.355 --> 36:20.522
The pilot is dead,
maybe the entire crew.

36:20.523 --> 36:22.566
There's nobody flying it.

36:22.567 --> 36:25.237
Yes, I know, it sounds crazy.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.534
Where am I?

36:32.535 --> 36:34.995
You have to tell me.

36:34.996 --> 36:36.288
Are you on a plane?

36:36.289 --> 36:38.415
I was. I think I am.

36:38.416 --> 36:41.919
What is the flight? What is the airline?

36:41.920 --> 36:45.360
There's no pressure. We lost pressure.

36:45.715 --> 36:49.176
<i>It was a long flight.
Lots of head winds.</i>

36:49.177 --> 36:52.217
<i>We were more than an hour behind.</i>

36:53.514 --> 36:55.849
<i>It was liKe the air
just got sucKed out of the plane.</i>

36:55.850 --> 36:58.350
<i>We couldn"t breathe.</i>

36:59.771 --> 37:02.271
What's happening?

37:09.238 --> 37:12.248
Open up. It's too cold out here.

37:14.994 --> 37:19.644
What's going on in there?
It's too cold out here!

37:19.749 --> 37:21.082
We lost pressure.

37:21.083 --> 37:24.044
What is the flight number?
What is the airline?

37:24.045 --> 37:26.379
Trans-Eastern Air 395.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.970
Where did you take off from?

37:29.342 --> 37:31.842
Johannesburg.

37:32.386 --> 37:34.886
The captain needs me.

37:41.395 --> 37:43.313
Well, is there someone else I can...

37:43.314 --> 37:46.107
Look, I'm serious.
This plane may crash any minute.

37:46.108 --> 37:48.568
Damn it!

37:48.569 --> 37:49.819
These government people!

37:49.820 --> 37:51.404
I've been hung up on
three times already

37:51.405 --> 37:52.572
and one of them actually asked me

37:52.573 --> 37:57.076
if I could get my mommy or daddy
to come to the phone.

37:57.077 --> 37:59.078
What?

37:59.079 --> 38:01.707
Andrea, the plane...

38:02.708 --> 38:06.308
The flight, it took off in Johannesburg.

38:08.923 --> 38:11.007
No.

38:11.008 --> 38:13.259
No, it's... It's too weird.

38:13.260 --> 38:15.760
Where are you going?

38:16.096 --> 38:17.847
I'm gonna go to
my brother's apartment in the city

38:17.848 --> 38:20.350
and the doorman will let me in. I just...

38:20.351 --> 38:23.186
I'm sure there's something
about his flights on his computer, I...

38:23.187 --> 38:24.520
I have to know if he flew today.

38:24.521 --> 38:26.355
Andrea, we should stay on the phone.

38:26.356 --> 38:28.856
I'll come back!

38:35.407 --> 38:38.034
What the hell happened back there?

38:38.035 --> 38:39.952
Like I said,
I must have gotten up too fast.

38:39.953 --> 38:42.455
Come on, don't treat me like I'm stupid.

38:42.456 --> 38:45.208
All right, look.
It's just a problem I have sometimes.

38:45.209 --> 38:46.751
Things like that, they get to me.

38:46.752 --> 38:49.922
How'd you handle it in med school?

38:51.882 --> 38:53.549
You didn't handle it in med school.

38:53.550 --> 38:57.219
I kept passing out
in gross anatomy anytime I saw blood.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.512
I was invited to leave.

38:58.513 --> 39:01.140
What the hell are you doing this for?

39:01.141 --> 39:02.391
Because I gotta get over it.

39:02.392 --> 39:04.602
I can't let it stop me.
I don't want to be weak.

39:04.603 --> 39:07.563
Look, this job isn't for everyone, okay?
There's no shame in that.

39:07.564 --> 39:10.024
If you can't hold it together out there,
you're no good to me

39:10.025 --> 39:11.525
and you're no good to the patients.

39:11.526 --> 39:13.402
I have to be able to count on you.

39:13.403 --> 39:16.405
I just gotta learn to get hard about it
and how not to care.

39:16.406 --> 39:20.075
No. We're all gonna see
things we don't want to see.

39:20.076 --> 39:23.546
Blood, gore,
a severed hand sometimes.

39:23.830 --> 39:26.832
What you have to learn
is to be able to look past it.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.042
You know, you get that tunnel visión

39:28.043 --> 39:30.377
where the only thing
you see is the person suffering,

39:30.378 --> 39:31.879
the person who needs to be saved.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.255
- Focus on that.
- Did you hear that?

39:33.256 --> 39:37.259
<i>... jetliner is heading in from
the Atlantic towards the East Coast.</i>

39:37.260 --> 39:41.430
<i>95% probability
it will come down in Driscoll County.</i>

39:41.431 --> 39:45.351
<i>The plane has not
responded to controllers.</i>

39:46.644 --> 39:48.479
<i>- Jim.
- Mel. It"s all over the news.</i>

39:48.480 --> 39:50.105
They said the plane's
heading right toward us.

39:50.106 --> 39:51.398
Did they say when?

39:51.399 --> 39:53.358
<i>I don"t thinK they Know.</i>

39:53.359 --> 39:55.194
The pilot said, "We're close."

39:55.195 --> 39:58.822
Mel, go out on the square.
Warn people. Tell them to get inside.

39:58.823 --> 39:59.948
We're heading back.

39:59.949 --> 40:02.449
Hurry.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.127
Check and see if people are all right!

41:12.128 --> 41:13.295
The plane went down.
The plane went down.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.797
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

41:14.798 --> 41:17.216
Get inside. Get inside.

41:17.217 --> 41:19.259
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

41:19.260 --> 41:20.385
Come on.

41:20.386 --> 41:22.888
Jim, that flight came in
from Johannesburg.

41:22.889 --> 41:24.848
- Andrea's brother might be on it.
- Where is she?

41:24.849 --> 41:27.267
She drove in to the city
to check his apartment.

41:27.268 --> 41:28.477
No, no, she'll be right back.

41:28.478 --> 41:30.979
They're gonna close all the bridges
and tunnels in a couple of minutes.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.397
Come on. You gotta get inside.

41:32.398 --> 41:34.898
Be careful.

41:39.155 --> 41:42.655
Dispatch, dispatch.
Grandview medic 56.

41:43.159 --> 41:45.660
I have a visual on an aircraft down

41:45.661 --> 41:48.747
about a mile, a mile and a half
from the main street, due south.

41:48.748 --> 41:51.833
Look, start a first-alarm assignment to
that location and show us responding.

41:51.834 --> 41:53.418
<i>Roger, Clancy.</i>

41:53.419 --> 41:55.670
Come on.

41:55.671 --> 41:57.964
Hey, look,
you're on this one now, okay?

41:57.965 --> 41:59.174
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

41:59.175 --> 42:01.927
And you're not gonna prove anything
to yourself on my dime, understand?

42:01.928 --> 42:06.288
- I'm gonna do all right, I swear.
- Let's go.

42:45.471 --> 42:47.971
Melinda.

42:48.182 --> 42:50.822
I was driving, and I saw it.

42:50.934 --> 42:52.769
It went down right over me.

42:52.770 --> 42:55.270
There were cars everywhere.

42:56.231 --> 42:58.316
Melinda, if my brother
was on that plane,

42:58.317 --> 43:00.907
there is no way he survived.

43:02.446 --> 43:04.572
Andrea.

43:04.573 --> 43:07.617
We should call.
We should call someone.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.744
The phones are out.

43:09.745 --> 43:12.245
There's no signal.
