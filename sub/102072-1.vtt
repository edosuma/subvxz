M_I_SForEver

02:06.853 --> 02:10.723
Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey!

02:13.693 --> 02:16.461
Hey! Hey!

03:10.149 --> 03:14.386
Stop! Stop!
He's coming.

03:14.419 --> 03:15.221
Hold on.

03:15.254 --> 03:17.322
- He's coming!
- Let me go! No!

03:19.926 --> 03:21.861
Stop!
You're making it worse! Stop!

03:21.894 --> 03:23.663
- Don't tie her down! Stop!
- Go ahead.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.030
The medicine
makes her a zombie.

03:58.064 --> 04:00.599
Of course she's going to try
to wean herself off of it.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.868
It doesn't make
any sense.

04:01.901 --> 04:03.535
Here's your checklist,
Rain.

04:16.481 --> 04:20.418
It's been years,
and that's the best you can do?

04:20.952 --> 04:22.587
- <i>Yes.</i>
- You're a doctor.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.690
Jumping to anger isn't helping.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.125
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

04:26.158 --> 04:28.060
It's just... She said
she was feeling better.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.663
We see that regularly
with schizophrenia.

04:30.863 --> 04:32.865
Patients take their medicine,
feel better,

04:32.899 --> 04:34.734
and then think
they can go off it.

04:35.935 --> 04:37.069
But it can't be cured.

04:37.602 --> 04:38.905
She's gonna be an adult.

04:39.305 --> 04:41.606
And then what? We're supposed
to lock her in a room

04:41.641 --> 04:42.909
- for the rest of her life?
- John.

04:43.376 --> 04:44.609
What? Is there...

04:45.610 --> 04:46.746
another way? What?

04:47.179 --> 04:49.614
Short of admitting her
into a psychiatric facility...

04:49.649 --> 04:50.883
- No!
- Absolutely not!

04:51.150 --> 04:53.485
Her psychiatrist
can try switching her over

04:53.518 --> 04:55.054
to an atypical antipsychotic,

04:55.487 --> 04:57.522
which may have
fewer side effects.

05:02.228 --> 05:03.195
Hey, baby.

05:06.966 --> 05:08.167
Is this happening?

05:09.902 --> 05:11.637
John, she's awake.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.441
Hey, baby.

05:20.746 --> 05:22.715
- Hanging in there?
- Yeah. Okay.

05:27.987 --> 05:29.822
<i>Again, for maintenance staff,</i>

05:29.855 --> 05:32.091
<i>please call extension 405.</i>

05:32.124 --> 05:34.961
<i>Again, for maintenance staff,
please call extension 405.</i>

05:35.227 --> 05:36.662
Can I get you anything?

05:39.999 --> 05:40.933
Rain?

05:42.802 --> 05:43.601
Rain?

05:43.970 --> 05:46.538
Didn't you say you wanted
something to sketch with?

05:47.873 --> 05:48.941
Um, wait.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.777
Could I have a pencil?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.814
- We can't give...
- Just a soft sketch pencil.

05:58.084 --> 05:59.551
I'll get you some crayons.

06:01.253 --> 06:05.523
<i>Dr. Lin,
you got 447, Dr. Lin, 447.</i>

06:08.027 --> 06:09.261
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

06:10.930 --> 06:12.098
Whatever comes to mind.

06:15.034 --> 06:17.069
Nothing?

06:18.704 --> 06:19.805
Too much.

06:24.076 --> 06:27.146
Well, let's start with what
you remember then.

06:27.612 --> 06:29.581
Do you recall anything
that triggered it?

06:30.216 --> 06:31.150
Um...

06:33.119 --> 06:36.088
I'm... I don't...
I don't... I remember...

06:36.689 --> 06:40.026
<i>going upstairs and then
being on the bus.</i>

06:42.261 --> 06:43.896
But you never left your house.

06:44.463 --> 06:46.098
<i>I was in the woods,
though.</i>

06:46.132 --> 06:48.200
<i>There was a man chasing me.</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:50.803
Rain, these episodes
get increasingly worse

06:50.836 --> 06:52.671
each time you try
going off your meds.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.572
You just... you don't...
you don't understand. I...

06:57.609 --> 06:59.745
I get that the medicine
could make me,

06:59.779 --> 07:03.082
like, more stable or whatever
but I...

07:03.749 --> 07:05.251
It makes me feel like a zombie.

07:05.284 --> 07:08.687
And I... I can't paint,
if I can't feel anything.

07:09.021 --> 07:10.923
We can try experimenting
until we find

07:10.956 --> 07:12.191
- the right com...
- Experimenting?

07:12.224 --> 07:14.260
I'm not... I'm not a lab rat.

07:14.293 --> 07:16.662
Not taking it is not an option.

07:17.063 --> 07:18.596
One more misstep and the state

07:18.631 --> 07:20.132
is going
to institutionalize you, Rain.

07:24.770 --> 07:25.671
It's not fair.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.774
People see and hear God.

07:29.775 --> 07:31.043
No one thinks they're nuts.

07:34.046 --> 07:35.181
That's not the same thing.

07:36.182 --> 07:37.183
Why not?

07:55.868 --> 07:57.036
Is everything okay?

07:58.337 --> 08:00.306
Yeah, monkey.
Everything's fine.

08:15.421 --> 08:16.789
Jack of all trades.

08:16.822 --> 08:18.691
Yeah. Master of none.

08:19.425 --> 08:20.759
Mom, what's wrong?

08:22.928 --> 08:24.363
It's been a rough week.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.199
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.970
It's just... your dad
and I handle things differently.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.275
Let me know
if you need anything.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.084
Looking forward to having
you back in class, Rain.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.729
Grandma and grandpa?

08:58.964 --> 08:59.999
Who else?

09:01.767 --> 09:02.768
It didn't work.

09:04.203 --> 09:05.704
I'll let you tell them that.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.875
And for what it's worth,

09:10.509 --> 09:13.112
they sent me good luck balloons
when I told them

09:13.145 --> 09:14.914
I wanted to open
my own restaurant.

09:16.148 --> 09:17.449
Yeah, look how that ended up.

09:18.384 --> 09:19.418
Sold out.

09:29.495 --> 09:30.696
Rain?

09:33.432 --> 09:36.135
Hey, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.873
- Just...
- Stop! Get off!

10:12.706 --> 10:13.906
Hey.

10:15.007 --> 10:16.775
Don't worry about all this,
okay?

10:17.343 --> 10:18.410
I'll get it fixed up.

10:25.918 --> 10:28.487
Oh, it's okay, monkey.
It's okay.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.259
Hey. Why don't you stay
in the guest room

10:33.292 --> 10:35.027
till I'll get it all
put back together.

10:35.394 --> 10:36.395
All right?

11:35.054 --> 11:36.121
This is my fault.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.016
You have not lost me, brother.

12:04.049 --> 12:06.385
You like strawberry pomegranate?
Are you cool with that?

12:06.418 --> 12:08.253
Yeah. Just a normal PBJ
is fine, Dad.

12:08.287 --> 12:11.056
It's normal,
it's just, like, spruced up.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.959
- Dad, I'm sure it's fine.
- I put my magic touch on it.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.461
Hey...

12:16.562 --> 12:18.197
- I know you're...
- I've missed this.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.132
...you're on your way
out the door and stuff.

12:20.165 --> 12:21.634
- Dad.
- But I want you to know that

12:21.668 --> 12:22.968
- if you need to chill...
- Dad.

12:23.469 --> 12:26.171
- ...and maybe going to school...
- Dad, Dad.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.306
...you might feel a little bit...

12:27.339 --> 12:28.173
Dad, I love you

12:28.207 --> 12:30.275
and I understand
that you're worried...

12:30.542 --> 12:33.112
but I'm good.
You've got to let me try, okay?

12:34.179 --> 12:35.147
Okay.

12:37.516 --> 12:39.351
It's not like I'm on drugs
or anything.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.458
Best jelly I ever had.

12:46.492 --> 12:48.628
It's jam,
it's made from fruit pulp.

12:48.661 --> 12:50.295
Have a great day, sweetheart.

12:50.329 --> 12:52.665
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye. I love you.

13:40.479 --> 13:44.717
Uh, okay. We've got
a lot to cover if any of you

13:44.918 --> 13:47.219
have a hope in hell
of passing your finals.

13:51.056 --> 13:52.424
Welcome back, Rain.

13:53.058 --> 13:55.662
Care to join us? Come on.

14:01.266 --> 14:04.536
So, I gotta see more quotes
in your essays.

14:05.170 --> 14:09.374
I mean, you can't just say
"Heathcliff is a psycho."

14:11.443 --> 14:12.411
I mean, uh...

14:13.445 --> 14:14.681
Uh, well...

14:16.515 --> 14:20.252
you can't just say,
"Heathcliff is a sadistic ass

14:20.285 --> 14:23.589
because he spent his entire life
pining after his childhood crush

14:23.823 --> 14:26.325
and plotting against the man
she ends up marrying."

14:28.060 --> 14:29.428
And I'm not disagreeing
with you.

14:29.461 --> 14:30.996
But back up your claims.

14:31.196 --> 14:34.299
Let's get textual.

14:36.068 --> 14:38.103
Okay? Got it?

14:38.537 --> 14:41.039
Do we see nodding heads?
Yeah, please.

14:41.073 --> 14:43.208
Good. All right.
Let's get going.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.155
Chicken and guacamole.

14:57.757 --> 14:59.057
Sorry, it's just...

14:59.091 --> 15:01.426
I have a strict diet.
Medical stuff.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.606
I don't know.
I was just so annoyed...

15:14.641 --> 15:16.743
Hey. I tried calling you
the other day.

15:22.815 --> 15:24.651
I like your necklace. It's cool.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.452
It's a choker.

15:30.823 --> 15:32.659
Do you mind if I sit
with you guys?

15:32.692 --> 15:34.526
Oh, no room. Sorry.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.161
Not for all those personalities.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.264
- That's not what...
- Be careful.

15:39.298 --> 15:41.133
She might go all Carrie on us.

15:43.535 --> 15:44.236
Whoa.

15:44.737 --> 15:47.172
Yeah, you wouldn't even believe
half the things I've seen.

15:47.372 --> 15:49.274
I heard she tried
to kill herself.

15:49.308 --> 15:50.609
She's just desperate
for attention.

15:58.417 --> 15:59.418
Hey.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.823
I'm Caleb.
You wanna pick a card, any card?

16:06.793 --> 16:08.828
I know it's clichÃ©,
but come on,

16:09.829 --> 16:10.830
do it anyway.

16:14.734 --> 16:16.168
Come on, Rain.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.538
you know what, just take...

16:25.812 --> 16:27.714
You know, it's Tarot,
so it's a little more...

16:27.747 --> 16:29.414
difficult. Do you remember it?

16:30.717 --> 16:32.885
- Mm-hmm.
- Throw it back in the deck.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.287
Really gotta stop talking.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.190
I don't like magic.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.693
Well, you're in luck
because this isn't magic,

16:40.727 --> 16:41.694
this is skill.

16:42.962 --> 16:45.297
Tap the top of the deck.
Just give it a little...

16:48.533 --> 16:50.703
See, this is the really
interactive part

16:50.737 --> 16:52.571
where I just distract you,

16:52.604 --> 16:55.574
that way you're really impressed
when I swap it out

16:55.607 --> 16:58.410
and you flip over your card
and that's yours.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.481
What? It's not yours?

17:02.982 --> 17:04.516
No, no. I'm kidding.
I know that.

17:04.549 --> 17:06.919
I just gave you that one
as a gift to, you know,

17:06.953 --> 17:08.887
balance out your own,
which is under your bottle.

17:17.429 --> 17:19.699
Where you from?
Why haven't I seen you around?

17:20.165 --> 17:21.834
What is this, 20 questions?

17:23.502 --> 17:24.804
Five, so far actually.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.809
Um, I've been out sick.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.244
I mean, you're new.
Where are you from?

17:32.745 --> 17:33.680
Uh...

17:34.279 --> 17:38.383
Texas, Louisiana, Arizona,
Arkansas, New Mexico.

17:39.018 --> 17:41.219
Uh, must suck,
leaving your friends.

17:46.659 --> 17:50.797
Uh, I got to go do a bunch
of makeup work.

17:51.064 --> 17:52.832
'Cause I've been out.
Sorry. I gotta go.

17:53.032 --> 17:55.534
All right. Well, hey,
if you ever, you know,

17:55.567 --> 17:57.302
you wanna hang out sometime

17:57.335 --> 17:58.938
and grab a cup of coffee,
that'd be...

17:58.971 --> 18:01.908
Oh, I can't drink coffee.
Caffeine makes me...

18:02.307 --> 18:05.410
Well, me neither.
So, yeah, you know,

18:05.444 --> 18:08.480
if you ever wanna hang out
and grab a cup of non-coffee,

18:08.513 --> 18:10.449
that'd be... That'd be fun.

18:44.549 --> 18:45.584
Rain?

18:47.820 --> 18:48.821
Rain?

18:49.354 --> 18:50.857
I was just saying hi.

18:55.695 --> 18:56.729
Looks like you're up.

19:00.499 --> 19:03.301
Hi. I'm picking up
for Rain Burroughs.

19:03.335 --> 19:04.971
B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S.

20:11.536 --> 20:13.105
Yeah, as much
as I would love to,

20:13.139 --> 20:15.942
I don't... I don't think
now's a good time to be...

20:16.608 --> 20:18.678
to be starting up something
like that, so...

20:19.511 --> 20:22.048
Yeah. No, I've been wanting
to get back into it.

20:22.081 --> 20:25.417
It's just work's been hectic
and...

20:26.719 --> 20:28.788
I should probably
be around here.

20:29.222 --> 20:32.490
Thanks, though.
Thanks for thinking of me.

20:33.926 --> 20:35.828
Dad, who is that?

20:37.462 --> 20:41.533
Oh, hey. It was nothing.
It was Phil.

20:41.566 --> 20:45.071
He's... catering some events
this month,

20:45.104 --> 20:46.873
wanted to know
if I could help out. That's all.

20:46.906 --> 20:47.940
You're not going to?

20:47.974 --> 20:49.909
No. I don't... I don't have time.

20:50.142 --> 20:52.912
I mean, no, you should go.
You haven't cooked in forever.

20:53.612 --> 20:57.116
- I cook for you all the time.
- Yeah, Mom and I don't count.

20:58.951 --> 20:59.886
You sure?

21:01.721 --> 21:03.455
- Really?
- Yes.

21:04.257 --> 21:06.726
- I don't have to do it.
- We'll be fine.

21:16.534 --> 21:17.502
Rain?

21:21.874 --> 21:22.607
Honey,

21:22.909 --> 21:24.944
your father will take the door
off the hinges

21:24.977 --> 21:26.012
if you keep locking it.

21:26.212 --> 21:28.714
Yeah, I know.
It's a habit. Sorry.

21:31.684 --> 21:34.486
- Did you hear anything?
- Mm-mm.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.229
So, how was your first day back?

21:43.262 --> 21:44.764
It was great.

21:44.797 --> 21:46.899
Yeah, everyone thinks
I'm a freak.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.500
Oh, I doubt that.

21:49.001 --> 21:51.237
Isn't it cool
to be different nowadays?

21:51.270 --> 21:53.571
Not recently hospitalized
for psychosis.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.641
It's like the biggest event
of the year for them.

21:55.975 --> 21:57.843
It's ridiculous.
I mean, everyone knows.

21:57.877 --> 22:00.179
- Even my teachers.
- It'll blow over.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.480
Someone will get a bad haircut,

22:02.514 --> 22:04.750
or Alexa will make out
with someone's boyfriend, and...

22:05.384 --> 22:06.719
they'll forget all about it.

22:07.519 --> 22:11.023
No, she just...
won't talk to me anymore.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.491
She's got whole new friends
who love hearing horror stories

22:13.525 --> 22:14.827
about the crazy girl.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.128
Stop calling yourself that.

22:16.362 --> 22:18.197
It's like I'm a social currency.

22:21.599 --> 22:25.104
Whatever. I mean, I don't care.
It gives me more time to paint.

22:28.573 --> 22:30.009
I think that's what
I wanna study.

22:31.543 --> 22:33.179
- In college?
- Mm-hmm.

22:37.615 --> 22:39.051
You don't think I'll get in?

22:40.219 --> 22:41.153
No, I just...

22:41.821 --> 22:43.555
I didn't know
that's what you wanted.

22:44.924 --> 22:45.925
I think...

22:49.561 --> 22:50.963
I think that would be wonderful
for you.

23:07.612 --> 23:09.115
How long is this going to take?

23:10.316 --> 23:11.951
Well, it's me.

23:11.984 --> 23:13.919
I'm a spectacularly talented
daughter,

23:13.953 --> 23:16.155
who's one to spend hours
memorializing me.

23:16.489 --> 23:18.657
I can actually feel
myself aging.

23:19.524 --> 23:22.028
Yeah, you're right.
A lot of wrinkles.

23:22.661 --> 23:24.096
Who knows how long that'll take.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.231
Hmm.

23:28.267 --> 23:29.235
Bring your sweater.

23:29.268 --> 23:32.071
It's 90 degrees outside.
I'm already roasting.

23:32.104 --> 23:35.041
- It feels good.
- Yeah, for a sauna.

23:37.977 --> 23:39.011
Bye.

23:57.963 --> 23:58.931
Ready, guys?

23:59.832 --> 24:02.301
And go.

24:07.306 --> 24:08.874
Hey, I'll walk with you.

24:08.908 --> 24:11.043
No, thanks.
We don't wanna catch your crazy.

24:11.077 --> 24:12.645
Hey, wait up.

24:17.950 --> 24:18.918
Hey!

24:20.152 --> 24:22.321
- What are you up to?
- What are you doing?

24:23.856 --> 24:25.791
- Cutting class, I guess.
- Well, stop.

24:25.825 --> 24:27.059
Why? It's just P.E.

24:27.093 --> 24:28.294
Gonna end up
in the nurse's office anyway.

24:28.327 --> 24:29.795
I mean, stop following me.

24:30.663 --> 24:31.664
Are you okay?

24:32.597 --> 24:35.634
No, I'm not okay. My best friend
won't even talk to me anymore.

24:35.668 --> 24:36.969
- Why not?
- I don't know.

24:37.203 --> 24:38.871
There's got to be some kind
of reason.

24:38.904 --> 24:40.773
When I said I don't know,
I mean I kind of know,

24:40.806 --> 24:42.074
I just don't wanna talk
about it.

24:42.341 --> 24:43.275
Oh.

24:45.177 --> 24:46.378
You wanna get out of here?

24:46.912 --> 24:49.915
Maybe I could take you home
or wherever.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.284
Wherever?

24:53.752 --> 24:54.753
Yeah.

24:58.023 --> 24:58.991
Okay.

25:00.926 --> 25:03.362
We're gonna be pedaling
this thing like the Flintstones.

25:04.029 --> 25:06.365
Yeah, sorry,
I'm still restoring it.

25:07.433 --> 25:08.701
How long has it been?

25:09.835 --> 25:10.603
A while.

25:11.036 --> 25:13.205
It wasn't running, so I had
to rebuild the carburetor.

25:13.239 --> 25:16.942
I've got new rotors, brake pads,
change the starter

25:16.976 --> 25:19.278
and then replaced the rack
and pinion.

25:19.311 --> 25:20.679
It's been about six months,

25:20.913 --> 25:22.915
But, you know...

25:22.948 --> 25:25.117
I ran out of money
before I got to the body.

25:25.151 --> 25:27.319
- At least it's running.
- For now.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.693
Oh. So, is that what
you wanna do?

25:34.727 --> 25:36.395
- What?
- Be a mechanic?

25:37.129 --> 25:38.964
No. Well...

25:40.766 --> 25:42.168
car mechanics
and quantum mechanics

25:42.201 --> 25:44.703
aren't closely related.
They're more like homonyms.

25:44.737 --> 25:47.306
You know, like,
a wave versus two wave.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.909
If that makes sense.

25:51.277 --> 25:54.313
- That's cool.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

25:54.613 --> 25:58.751
Okay. We're gonna have to...

25:59.418 --> 26:01.954
- stop here.
- What? Why?

26:01.987 --> 26:02.888
Uh...

26:03.489 --> 26:06.292
My... My windshield wipers
aren't working.

26:07.526 --> 26:09.261
We're gonna be stuck here
for a minute.

26:19.939 --> 26:21.240
Do you have to do that?

26:21.607 --> 26:23.943
- What?
- Just magic. Right now?

26:24.743 --> 26:26.812
I already told you
it's not magic. It's skill.

26:27.346 --> 26:28.814
It's puzzles, sleight of hand.

26:28.847 --> 26:30.449
Everything is contingent
on the sleight of mind.

26:30.482 --> 26:31.784
Everything's an illusion.

26:32.518 --> 26:34.019
<i>Get out while you can.</i>

26:34.053 --> 26:35.821
<i>Back to weather
on the seven.</i>

26:35.854 --> 26:37.056
<i>Please, please stop.</i>

26:37.923 --> 26:38.991
Are you okay?

26:40.192 --> 26:41.093
Mm-hmm.

26:42.094 --> 26:44.363
Well, you're fidgeting,
and your face is flushed,

26:44.396 --> 26:46.065
your breathing's
shortened, so...

26:46.432 --> 26:47.266
What are you afraid of?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.969
Nothing. You're just...
You're just talking really fast.

26:52.304 --> 26:54.440
I guess I can have that effect
on people sometimes.

26:54.473 --> 26:57.009
It's just because I don't like
about inconsequential stuff

26:57.042 --> 26:58.177
like the weather.

27:02.815 --> 27:04.149
Which would be ironic actually.

27:04.783 --> 27:07.086
- Hmm?
- If it was the weather.

27:07.886 --> 27:11.156
You know, like,
Rain afraid of rain.

27:12.524 --> 27:14.393
<i>Run now. Rain, run!</i>

27:14.661 --> 27:16.862
No. I just... I just...
I just wanna go home.

27:20.599 --> 27:21.834
- Right here?
- Yeah.

27:30.442 --> 27:31.477
It's okay.

27:31.711 --> 27:33.979
Oh, you didn't have
to get my door.

27:34.179 --> 27:37.216
I did. The passenger door
doesn't open from the inside,

27:37.249 --> 27:38.117
so it's...

27:44.390 --> 27:46.825
- Sorry for wasting your day.
- Oh, you didn't waste it.

27:47.761 --> 27:49.828
You don't have to protect
my feelings either.

27:52.898 --> 27:54.900
This was actually the...
One of the best days

27:54.933 --> 27:56.302
I've had in a really long time.

27:59.238 --> 28:00.839
We didn't do anything.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.344
Yeah.

28:16.889 --> 28:18.590
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

28:23.562 --> 28:26.198
Look, there's something
I need to tell you,

28:26.965 --> 28:29.234
I don't want you
to get freaked out or anything.

28:29.435 --> 28:31.303
I'm, like, sick.

28:32.471 --> 28:34.440
No, I mean,
not like cancer. Like...

28:36.108 --> 28:37.176
in my head.

29:06.205 --> 29:07.206
Hey, Rain?

29:12.211 --> 29:15.314
Oh, hey. Okay. This thing's
gonna go really late,

29:15.347 --> 29:17.049
and I got my guys working,

29:17.082 --> 29:18.685
so they're gonna handle
the cleanup.

29:18.718 --> 29:21.654
I'll be home as early as I can,
I promise. And I have my phone.

29:21.688 --> 29:22.488
Okay.

29:22.521 --> 29:24.089
Where's your phone?
Do you have it?

29:24.123 --> 29:25.190
Yes, I have my phone.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.059
All right.

29:31.230 --> 29:34.032
I literally just told you
not to lock the door.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.301
Rain, I'm not gonna tell you
again.

29:39.371 --> 29:41.073
- Where were you?
- I...

29:41.440 --> 29:43.008
I was at the library. I was...

29:43.710 --> 29:45.277
studying and...

29:48.648 --> 29:49.581
Mm-hmm.

29:49.615 --> 29:51.617
- What's his name?
- Who?

29:52.151 --> 29:54.953
You forget your father and I
were study buddies.

29:55.387 --> 29:56.555
That's gross.

29:58.390 --> 30:00.092
His name is Caleb.

30:01.126 --> 30:02.027
It's a nice name.

30:06.633 --> 30:08.233
I got to call your grandparents.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.068
You should help your father
finish loading up.

30:54.179 --> 30:55.380
Help!

30:59.585 --> 31:01.453
It's not real, it's not real.

31:01.654 --> 31:04.223
- It's not real, it's not real.
- Rain? Hey.

31:04.523 --> 31:06.425
- Did you hear that?
- What?

31:06.458 --> 31:08.560
There was a girl...
A girl next door,

31:08.594 --> 31:10.262
a tiny little girl.

31:11.731 --> 31:13.532
- Wh... Where?
- She was...

31:13.565 --> 31:15.601
She was screaming for help.
Did you hear?

31:16.001 --> 31:19.071
Um, no. I...
I didn't hear anything.

31:19.471 --> 31:20.572
Where did you see her?

31:20.606 --> 31:22.709
In the...
Over there in the window.

31:30.482 --> 31:33.252
- Rain, there's nobody out here.
- No, she was there. I swear.

31:33.285 --> 31:35.554
She was standing there
and then she... She grabbed her.

31:35.587 --> 31:36.756
- Who?
- Ms. McConnell?

31:36.789 --> 31:38.223
No. I don't know!
I couldn't see.

31:39.625 --> 31:40.526
Oh.

31:41.426 --> 31:43.295
Rain, use your checklist.

31:43.863 --> 31:45.297
Is it possible?

31:46.365 --> 31:48.768
No. She doesn't even have kids.

31:48.801 --> 31:51.370
Yeah, I know, but that...
That's the point, Dad.

31:53.138 --> 31:54.273
Oh, this is ridiculous.

31:54.606 --> 31:56.441
- Honey.
- All right.

31:56.743 --> 31:58.510
Why don't you try to go to bed

31:58.811 --> 32:02.649
and then, we'll go over there
tomorrow and...

32:04.116 --> 32:05.350
we'll check it out, okay?

32:16.261 --> 32:18.297
- On or off?
- On is good.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.802
- Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

32:22.835 --> 32:25.838
- Can you stay with me?
- Of course, baby girl.

32:39.518 --> 32:41.788
- You having second thoughts?
- No.

32:42.321 --> 32:44.757
- Are you sure?
- Dad.

32:48.895 --> 32:49.862
Oh!

32:50.262 --> 32:52.264
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:52.297 --> 32:53.565
I wasn't expecting guests.

32:55.702 --> 32:58.136
Yeah. Can we... Can we just
talk to you for a sec?

32:58.570 --> 33:00.707
Yeah, sure. Come on in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:05.344 --> 33:06.511
Sorry about the mess.

33:07.546 --> 33:08.781
I'm still fixing her up.

33:10.182 --> 33:11.450
You should see my place.

33:12.351 --> 33:13.653
I've seen your yard.

33:16.421 --> 33:17.657
So, what can I do for you?

33:19.324 --> 33:21.460
Okay, this might sound
a little bit weird,

33:21.493 --> 33:25.197
but um, Rain has been hearing
these noises,

33:25.397 --> 33:27.900
and we just thought that
we would come by

33:27.934 --> 33:30.135
to make sure everything was...
Everything is good.

33:30.602 --> 33:32.872
- What kind of noises?
- A little girl.

33:33.873 --> 33:34.841
Little girl?

33:36.976 --> 33:40.312
Uh, the folks across the street
have kids.

33:40.345 --> 33:41.546
That's probably what you heard.

33:41.748 --> 33:43.683
- She's lying!
- Rain.

33:43.716 --> 33:45.918
There's a little girl
in your attic! I saw her.

33:46.819 --> 33:47.720
In my attic?

33:47.987 --> 33:49.789
I have an attic,

33:49.822 --> 33:52.624
but there's no one up there
as far as I know.

33:54.359 --> 33:56.729
I'm happy to bring you up there.

33:56.763 --> 33:58.597
No, no, no, that's... We're good.

33:58.631 --> 34:00.432
- Thank you for the offer.
- Yeah. I want to.

34:03.568 --> 34:05.672
Oh!

34:06.505 --> 34:09.809
Okay. Well, this does not
make me look good.

34:10.475 --> 34:12.511
- Quite a collection.
- Yeah.

34:12.543 --> 34:14.781
I have not been up here
since Gram passed.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.818
She made each one by hand.

34:20.518 --> 34:23.422
Their clothes were much nicer
than anything she ever made us.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.693
Yeah, it sure does
bring back memories.

34:30.763 --> 34:32.464
Oh! Oh, jeez.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.734
Don't... I definitely don't even
worry about it.

34:36.703 --> 34:37.704
Jeez.

34:50.549 --> 34:51.583
- Hey.
- Yeah?

34:51.616 --> 34:52.952
We'll get out
of your hair.

34:54.053 --> 34:55.253
You good, Rain?

35:00.026 --> 35:02.260
Thank you for humoring her.

35:02.561 --> 35:03.663
That's not a problem.

35:05.597 --> 35:08.034
Humor me, Dad? What?
Do you think this is a joke?

35:08.067 --> 35:08.935
No, I don't.

35:08.968 --> 35:11.403
She's lying!
Did you see the Almanacs?

35:11.436 --> 35:13.706
- There's one up there from 2018!
- So what, Rain?

35:13.740 --> 35:15.440
She said
she hasn't been up there.

35:15.474 --> 35:16.642
Who gives a shit whether
she's been

35:16.676 --> 35:17.744
in her own attic or not?

35:17.777 --> 35:18.945
Well, you never believe me!

35:18.978 --> 35:20.479
You listen to someone
you don't even like.

35:20.512 --> 35:22.915
Hold up. I get it! I get it!
She's wacko, okay?

35:22.949 --> 35:24.884
But she sounds
a hell of a lot more logical

35:24.917 --> 35:25.785
- than you do right now.
- Can you just give me

35:26.152 --> 35:27.586
- the benefit of the doubt!
- Give you the benefit of the...

35:27.619 --> 35:28.320
Have you been listening
to yourself?

35:28.654 --> 35:29.321
- You can't, I'm crazy, right?
- No, no, no, no.

35:29.856 --> 35:30.622
- No. Rain, please stop it!
- I hear things, I see shit...

35:30.656 --> 35:33.025
Stop it!
Just stop it for a second.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.729
Everything is fine over there!

35:36.763 --> 35:38.396
When are you get that
through your head?

35:38.430 --> 35:39.866
What if that was me up there?

35:45.504 --> 35:46.605
Oh, my God.

36:10.897 --> 36:14.000
There's no one up there.
There's no one up there.

36:17.003 --> 36:18.537
There's no one up there.

36:22.474 --> 36:23.475
It's your mind.

36:26.779 --> 36:29.048
Your mind
is just playing tricks on you.

36:35.788 --> 36:37.924
Please stay away
from that house, okay?

36:41.661 --> 36:43.495
If she files
another complaint...

36:45.631 --> 36:48.567
the state is gonna put you
in a hospital.

36:51.804 --> 36:53.005
Can you promise me?

37:00.445 --> 37:01.446
Okay.

37:09.021 --> 37:09.989
Come here.

38:29.101 --> 38:30.937
<i>So how have you
been feeling</i>

38:30.970 --> 38:31.904
<i>since you've been home?</i>

38:31.938 --> 38:33.839
<i>Better than being
strapped down</i>

38:33.873 --> 38:34.974
<i>and experimented on.</i>

38:37.643 --> 38:40.780
I can't sleep, even though
I'm taking my medication,

38:41.314 --> 38:43.615
which I don't really need
in the first place.

38:43.883 --> 38:45.651
We've been through this before,
Rain.

38:45.851 --> 38:46.852
It's not helping.

38:47.619 --> 38:50.122
And I just wanna feel
like myself.

38:51.157 --> 38:54.694
You realize if you choose
to go off your medication,

38:54.961 --> 38:56.996
you're likely to end up
in an institution

38:57.029 --> 38:58.764
where they'll force you
to stay on it.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.801
I'm so sick of this.

39:02.301 --> 39:05.071
I know things are happening,
and no one believes me.

39:05.570 --> 39:08.107
And then it makes me question
whether it's just in my head,

39:08.140 --> 39:10.209
even though I know it's real.

39:10.710 --> 39:12.979
Is there anything in particular
that you're unsure of?

39:15.613 --> 39:16.816
Do you think I'm stupid?

39:17.149 --> 39:18.751
Do you think I think
you're stupid?

39:19.051 --> 39:20.219
I know they tell you things.

39:21.287 --> 39:22.021
Who's "they?"

39:22.321 --> 39:24.090
They told you
about the little girl, right?

39:24.357 --> 39:25.523
What girl?

39:25.958 --> 39:27.927
My neighbor is keeping
a little girl in her attic.

39:29.261 --> 39:32.031
Rain, this is not like
your other hallucinations.

39:32.497 --> 39:34.667
This is a serious accusation,

39:35.301 --> 39:37.903
one that'll likely have
equally serious consequences

39:37.937 --> 39:39.105
for one of you.

39:39.939 --> 39:40.973
I heard her screaming.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.542
Have you run
through your questions?

39:44.576 --> 39:45.244
Mm-hmm.

39:45.444 --> 39:46.979
Did anybody else react to her?

39:47.013 --> 39:48.914
No. No,
she's keeping her hidden.

39:48.948 --> 39:51.616
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know! I think...

39:51.650 --> 39:53.219
I think she kidnapped her,

39:53.252 --> 39:54.754
and she's keeping her
chained up,

39:54.787 --> 39:55.855
and she screams for help.

39:57.023 --> 39:58.190
Do you think it's possible

39:58.224 --> 40:00.726
that you might be projecting
your own fears

40:01.227 --> 40:03.129
of feeling confined
or restrained?

40:12.938 --> 40:14.273
<i>Projecting your own fears</i>

40:14.940 --> 40:17.176
<i>of feeling confined
and restrained?</i>

40:47.073 --> 40:50.643
Help me! Help me!
Get me out of here!

40:50.910 --> 40:53.913
Get me out of here!
Help, help!

40:57.917 --> 40:58.784
Yeah.

41:00.019 --> 41:01.120
What's that?

41:01.554 --> 41:04.023
Yeah, I guess
it could be possible.

41:32.218 --> 41:34.887
- I'm sorry, sweetie, you okay?
- Oh, yeah. It's just a cut.

41:35.387 --> 41:36.689
I was worried you were Mom.

41:36.989 --> 41:38.657
I'm making her dinner
to cheer her up.

41:39.725 --> 41:40.893
That's nice.

41:41.994 --> 41:43.028
What's that?

41:44.130 --> 41:46.665
- It's ranch.
- Buttermilk aioli?

41:47.533 --> 41:51.036
And I see some pan-roasted,
leavened bread

41:51.070 --> 41:53.739
with herb-infused tomato puree

41:53.772 --> 41:55.875
and a blend
of artisanal cheeses.

41:55.908 --> 41:57.143
Dad, she's coming! Distract her.

41:57.176 --> 41:58.010
- Right.
- What's going on?

41:58.043 --> 42:00.779
Nothing, Mom,
please don't come in.

42:00.813 --> 42:01.914
Okay, okay.

42:20.799 --> 42:22.168
The singularity is near.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.006
We're all gonna merge
with artificial intelligence.

42:27.273 --> 42:28.974
Not me, "we."

42:29.208 --> 42:31.343
- But them, "we." I'll be fine.
- How's that?

42:31.645 --> 42:34.046
Just no social media.
No cell phone.

42:34.079 --> 42:35.281
You don't have a cell phone?

42:35.314 --> 42:37.349
No. Otherwise I would've asked
for your number.

42:37.383 --> 42:39.051
But I don't.

42:41.487 --> 42:43.122
"Do-nut" forget to vote for me!

42:45.457 --> 42:46.892
- Will do.
- Thank you.

42:50.863 --> 42:51.830
Nice kid.

42:51.864 --> 42:53.866
Where do you even learn
about all that stuff?

42:54.099 --> 42:56.502
Oh, you know, online.
You can find out anything,

42:56.535 --> 42:57.736
if you know
what you're looking for.

42:58.404 --> 43:00.339
It's actually pretty
hypocritical for me to say.

43:00.372 --> 43:01.440
- I figured...
- <i>Idiot!</i>

43:01.473 --> 43:03.342
- What?
- <i>Loser is freaking me out.</i>

43:03.375 --> 43:04.843
- <i>Get out of here.</i>
- You know.

43:04.877 --> 43:05.744
<i>Stupid!</i>

43:05.778 --> 43:06.712
<i>Why didn't she just
die?</i>

43:06.745 --> 43:08.847
- <i>Stupid.</i>
- <i>Freak.</i>

43:09.181 --> 43:10.316
What are you feeling?

43:12.318 --> 43:13.319
Can we go outside?

43:29.068 --> 43:30.836
Yeah, she parked to the side.

43:31.570 --> 43:33.038
- Rain?
- One foot, right?

43:35.474 --> 43:36.542
- Rain?
- Shh! Shh!

43:36.575 --> 43:38.143
What are you...
What are you doing?

43:38.944 --> 43:41.447
- They're gonna take me away.
- Who?

43:42.147 --> 43:44.383
The cops! My neighbor,
she called the cops on me.

43:45.417 --> 43:47.253
I think they're just on patrol.

43:49.989 --> 43:51.023
You don't believe me?

43:51.590 --> 43:53.959
No. I mean,
I don't know, I guess.

43:53.993 --> 43:55.995
But why would she call the cops?

43:56.562 --> 43:58.364
She needs to get rid of me,
my neighbor.

43:58.397 --> 44:00.899
She kidnapped a little girl.
She's keeping her in her attic.

44:00.933 --> 44:02.167
Have you told the cops that?

44:02.201 --> 44:03.235
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

44:03.802 --> 44:06.472
- They're on her side!
- Dude, this is insane.

44:07.039 --> 44:08.941
Yeah. I know! I know.

44:08.974 --> 44:11.143
Okay. You're telling me
that your neighbor

44:11.176 --> 44:12.278
kidnapped a girl
and has her chained

44:12.311 --> 44:15.114
in her attic right now?
And she called the cops on you?

44:15.948 --> 44:17.549
- Do you realize how that sounds?
- Yeah.

44:17.583 --> 44:19.385
I know. Okay.
But have you seen the news?

44:19.418 --> 44:21.487
Look at Dahmer, no one thought
that could happen.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.523
He had neighbors.
But people are demented!

44:25.224 --> 44:26.258
Okay.

44:26.859 --> 44:28.394
I just need you to trust me.

44:28.762 --> 44:30.429
I do. All right. I...

44:31.997 --> 44:34.266
- If this is true, you gotta...
- It is true. Okay. I...

44:34.668 --> 44:36.368
I just need proof.

44:37.336 --> 44:40.372
All right, well, maybe I can...
Maybe I can help.

44:40.906 --> 44:42.541
Meet me here after school,
all right?

44:42.975 --> 44:44.543
We... we'll figure it out.

44:53.152 --> 44:53.952
Yeah.

44:53.986 --> 44:55.387
My mom's here.
I gotta go.

44:55.421 --> 44:56.822
All right,
see you tomorrow.

44:57.156 --> 44:58.957
Hey, get in.

45:02.027 --> 45:02.995
Okay.

45:08.067 --> 45:09.168
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

45:43.502 --> 45:46.138
Hi, Rain.
It's Dr. Pangloss here.

45:46.171 --> 45:47.940
I'm checking to see
if you're gonna make it

45:47.973 --> 45:49.274
to your appointment today.

46:16.135 --> 46:17.670
Hey, where are you going?

46:18.170 --> 46:19.938
I thought you left.

46:20.707 --> 46:22.174
I did. I had to fill up.

46:23.108 --> 46:25.144
Sorry. Here. Get in.

46:33.720 --> 46:34.620
Oh, my...

46:37.055 --> 46:38.390
Sorry. I kind of crushed it.

46:38.590 --> 46:41.193
No. It's actually...
It's for you.

46:41.226 --> 46:42.695
I made you a little something.

46:42.729 --> 46:44.664
- What is it?
- Open it.

46:46.031 --> 46:47.166
Is it magic?

46:47.566 --> 46:50.269
No. You don't like magic.

46:53.405 --> 46:54.440
It's a neuron.

46:57.075 --> 47:00.012
- Really?
- Yeah. You know, I...

47:00.546 --> 47:02.147
It's kind of nerdy,
you know, but...

47:04.349 --> 47:06.351
I don't know, I guess
I just like your brain.

47:11.323 --> 47:13.258
I love it. Thanks.

47:20.599 --> 47:21.500
That's her place.

47:22.167 --> 47:24.536
- That's nice.
- She inherited it.

47:25.738 --> 47:27.306
Okay. How are we gonna do this?

47:27.740 --> 47:28.708
Uh...

47:30.075 --> 47:31.109
We just wait, I guess,

47:31.143 --> 47:34.012
and watch,
figure out her schedule.

47:34.046 --> 47:36.014
She works Monday through Friday,
from 7:00 to 4:00,

47:36.048 --> 47:38.150
and has a night class at HCC
from 7:00 to 11:00.

47:38.183 --> 47:39.418
That's gonna be our prime time.

47:42.187 --> 47:44.056
What? Did you just think
I was gonna wait

47:44.089 --> 47:45.457
for someone else to fix this?

47:48.695 --> 47:50.362
I'm not breaking
into somebody's house.

47:50.395 --> 47:51.497
I need to know.

47:56.703 --> 47:58.738
Shh.
Come on, come on, come on.

47:59.204 --> 48:01.473
Why can't we come back
Wednesday when she's at work?

48:01.507 --> 48:04.009
Who knows what could happen
to her by Wednesday!

48:12.518 --> 48:14.486
This is new. It was open before.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.756
Well, then, let's just go.

48:16.956 --> 48:19.324
We got to find a screwdriver
or something!

48:25.264 --> 48:26.766
- Hey, look.
- So?

48:29.601 --> 48:30.737
Maybe she does have a kid.

48:37.844 --> 48:40.178
I found one!

49:27.894 --> 49:29.662
- What the hell, Rain?
- What?

49:29.696 --> 49:30.630
You said she works
Monday through Friday.

49:30.863 --> 49:33.131
It would've been helpful
to mention it was at our school.

49:33.165 --> 49:34.566
It's not okay.

49:39.438 --> 49:40.439
This is really bad.

50:55.782 --> 50:57.917
Walls don't bleed,
walls don't bleed.

50:58.751 --> 50:59.852
Walls don't bleed.

51:11.798 --> 51:13.866
- Mom?
- I'm sorry. It was just...

51:15.034 --> 51:17.536
- You scared me.
- I didn't mean to.

51:19.872 --> 51:21.808
Just wanted to see
what you're seeing.

51:23.442 --> 51:24.911
Be careful what you wish for.

51:28.413 --> 51:31.684
So, when am I gonna get
to meet this Caleb?

51:33.285 --> 51:34.419
Probably never.

51:34.954 --> 51:35.955
- Why?
- <i>Lie.</i>

51:36.421 --> 51:38.858
- It wasn't a lie.
- I didn't say it was.

51:39.624 --> 51:41.661
Yeah, well, I know
what you're thinking.

51:42.061 --> 51:43.261
What?

51:46.032 --> 51:47.566
You wanna know if he's real.

51:51.470 --> 51:54.473
Honestly, I don't know
if he is or not.

51:57.542 --> 51:59.679
I don't care. I like spending
time with him,

51:59.712 --> 52:00.913
even if he's an illusion.

52:01.981 --> 52:03.649
It's not healthy for you,
though.

52:03.683 --> 52:05.383
How do you know, Mom?

52:05.952 --> 52:08.721
You have no idea what it's like
to have no one to talk to.

52:09.055 --> 52:10.857
I finally have someone
to keep me company.

52:10.890 --> 52:12.591
And he's not hurting me
or anyone else.

52:12.624 --> 52:15.293
So, I don't understand
what the problem is.

52:16.394 --> 52:17.329
It's just...

52:18.898 --> 52:20.032
It could be a trigger.

52:22.668 --> 52:24.336
And you always have me talk to.

52:24.737 --> 52:26.338
That's just not the same.

52:27.974 --> 52:29.341
Why? Because I'm real?

52:35.413 --> 52:36.883
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

52:38.017 --> 52:39.018
I just...

52:41.754 --> 52:44.623
I wanna get better.
I really... I do.

52:49.695 --> 52:51.664
Sometimes I'm just afraid
to lose it all.

52:54.634 --> 52:55.567
I know, baby.

52:57.703 --> 52:58.603
I know.

53:27.432 --> 53:28.366
Hey!

53:29.534 --> 53:31.070
Let's skip class
and go back to her place.

53:31.737 --> 53:33.039
- You're joking, right?
- No.

53:36.642 --> 53:39.377
Rain, I'm not about to break
into my teacher's house!

53:39.411 --> 53:41.346
Well, you kind of already did.

53:42.081 --> 53:43.381
Well, I'm not doing it again.

53:43.749 --> 53:46.819
Can't we just hang out
and do something normal?

54:45.077 --> 54:46.812
<i>Hey, let's go back
to the school.</i>

54:46.846 --> 54:48.580
<i>I have an idea and this time
it doesn't involve</i>

54:48.613 --> 54:50.049
<i>anything, you know, illegal.</i>

54:50.615 --> 54:52.718
<i>I've been looking online
for two weeks.</i>

54:52.752 --> 54:53.551
<i>You're not gonna find her.</i>

54:53.920 --> 54:56.989
Well, you are severely
underestimating my skills here.

54:57.422 --> 55:00.960
- How old would you say she was?
- Three or four.

55:02.560 --> 55:03.796
There's so many of them.

55:04.764 --> 55:06.966
The world's full of monsters.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.468
All right. Well,
we're just gonna have...

55:10.502 --> 55:11.771
- to start in Florida.
- Okay.

55:12.805 --> 55:15.074
And just move out from there.

55:17.143 --> 55:19.178
No. Scroll down.

55:20.612 --> 55:22.949
You can't even search by gender.
It's just...

55:22.982 --> 55:26.252
Um... Okay. Try, like...
Try Georgia or something.

55:26.285 --> 55:29.755
- Any of these look familiar?
- Go to that one.

55:30.156 --> 55:31.523
- This one?
- Yeah.

55:33.525 --> 55:34.827
No, that's not her.

55:37.129 --> 55:38.898
- What about any of these?
- No.

55:40.032 --> 55:43.002
You know, that kind that looks...
Okay, no. That's not it.

55:43.669 --> 55:47.073
Okay. Go back. Try, um...
Try South Carolina.

55:50.309 --> 55:51.944
Keep going. Scroll, scroll.

55:53.045 --> 55:54.080
No.

55:54.479 --> 55:56.215
Go back. Try Alabama.

55:58.951 --> 56:01.519
I'm telling you,
she had this really curly hair.

56:02.554 --> 56:03.723
Hmm?

56:04.824 --> 56:05.691
Mm-mm.

56:06.826 --> 56:07.960
Try North Carolina.

56:10.830 --> 56:12.231
Wait, wait, go back up.

56:16.869 --> 56:17.770
Oh, my...

56:21.007 --> 56:25.311
Oh, my God. That... that's her.
That's the little girl.

56:25.344 --> 56:26.846
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

56:27.313 --> 56:30.016
Malia Robinson
missing from Pender County

56:30.049 --> 56:31.717
since February.

56:32.985 --> 56:34.854
Believed to be abducted
from her home.

56:34.887 --> 56:35.821
Oh, my God. This is... this...

56:36.022 --> 56:39.692
You're ama... Oh, my God.
We need to call her parents.

56:40.292 --> 56:41.727
And tell them what?

56:42.028 --> 56:44.596
Well, tell them
that we found her, like...

56:44.797 --> 56:46.265
Are you sure that's a good idea?

56:46.298 --> 56:47.900
I'm like...
I'm like freaking out right now.

56:47.933 --> 56:50.803
I need to... Um, I need to grab
a drink of water a bit.

56:50.836 --> 56:52.570
I'll be right back. Uh, find...

56:52.604 --> 56:55.241
Find her contact information,
and I'll... I'll be right back.

56:58.310 --> 57:01.013
Why are you taking it out on me?
I'm not the one who left.

57:03.615 --> 57:04.316
Hello?

57:05.885 --> 57:06.786
Hello?

57:11.023 --> 57:12.925
- God.
- Is everything okay?

57:18.697 --> 57:19.632
My parents...

57:20.900 --> 57:23.035
they just won't even
speak to each other.

57:23.369 --> 57:26.272
I have no way
of paying for college.

57:26.305 --> 57:28.040
And it's not just fair,
you know.

57:28.541 --> 57:31.277
I don't wanna get stuck here.
It's not my fault!

57:34.080 --> 57:36.282
I... I feel like I can't breathe.

57:37.650 --> 57:38.818
No, wait, I can help.

57:38.851 --> 57:40.352
- We can grab a...
- Stop!

57:40.386 --> 57:41.654
Get away from me!

57:44.957 --> 57:46.959
I think she's having
a panic attack.

57:48.327 --> 57:50.029
Just because
you're schizophrenic

57:50.062 --> 57:52.064
doesn't mean the rest of us
are messed up, too!

58:13.686 --> 58:14.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:25.364 --> 58:27.700
It doesn't bother me, you know.

58:28.501 --> 58:30.402
I just wish you would've told me
what it was.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.074
They've diagnosed me
with so many things,

58:35.107 --> 58:37.143
I don't really know
what to believe anymore.

58:38.277 --> 58:43.048
If you don't wanna be friends
after this, I'll understand.

58:49.955 --> 58:51.690
You wanna grab something to eat?

59:01.300 --> 59:03.302
I don't wanna be
insensitive or anything,

59:03.335 --> 59:05.104
but what it's like?

59:05.538 --> 59:06.372
What do you mean?

59:06.405 --> 59:08.307
You know,
do you see things?

59:08.340 --> 59:09.842
Do you hear things?

59:10.376 --> 59:11.177
I don't know.

59:11.410 --> 59:13.746
I wanna know everything
about it. You know, I...

59:14.013 --> 59:15.748
Okay, that's a lot.

59:15.781 --> 59:17.283
Sorry,
I'm being rude here. I...

59:17.516 --> 59:19.185
No, it's fine. Um...

59:24.523 --> 59:27.893
Number one, I don't have
multiple personalities.

59:28.662 --> 59:31.130
A lot people assume that,
but it's completely different.

59:31.397 --> 59:33.866
All right. So it's just Rain.

59:34.066 --> 59:37.770
I mean, not exactly.
There's a lot of voices

59:37.803 --> 59:40.206
that say the worst things
you could possibly imagine.

59:40.472 --> 59:42.041
I mean, or that I could.

59:46.378 --> 59:48.380
I mean, to be honest,
it gets kind of scary

59:48.414 --> 59:49.949
not really knowing
if I can trust

59:49.982 --> 59:51.317
what I see or hear.

59:52.484 --> 59:53.786
But a lot of people,

59:53.819 --> 59:55.354
they don't have
visual hallucinations,

59:55.387 --> 59:56.488
just auditory ones.

59:58.424 --> 01:00:01.126
But I have both, so...

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:05.064
Sorry. I... I know
it's kind of...

01:00:06.031 --> 01:00:07.266
- weird.
- No.

01:00:09.134 --> 01:00:10.970
It's what makes you you.
You know, I...

01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:14.240
I'm different, you're different.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.042
Why should we have
to apologize for that, you know?

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:19.445
I don't see anybody else
apologizing for having

01:00:19.812 --> 01:00:23.916
diabetes or tuberculosis,
you know.

01:00:29.355 --> 01:00:32.491
Look, Rain, it's...

01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:35.494
it's okay if she's not real.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.883
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah. Bye.

01:01:26.879 --> 01:01:29.948
- Hey, you're home late.
- It's only 7:00.

01:01:31.317 --> 01:01:32.818
Did you do anything today?

01:01:36.588 --> 01:01:39.224
Mom, if I can get out
and socialize, you can, too.

01:01:43.028 --> 01:01:44.063
I'm proud of you.

01:01:53.038 --> 01:01:56.308
Hey, Monkey,
I've got a surprise for you.

01:02:11.658 --> 01:02:12.558
Ta-da.

01:02:13.926 --> 01:02:14.860
What do you think?

01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:16.628
Yeah, it looks good.

01:02:25.971 --> 01:02:27.039
You remember that day?

01:02:28.173 --> 01:02:29.975
Yeah. You and Mom looked
so happy.

01:02:39.985 --> 01:02:42.154
I think I'm gonna stay
in the other room for now.

01:02:43.088 --> 01:02:44.189
Oh, okay.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:32.404
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:03:35.307 --> 01:03:36.542
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.144
<i>Do something.</i>

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.682
<i>Help me.</i>

01:04:19.686 --> 01:04:20.687
Mom?

01:04:22.755 --> 01:04:25.357
Mom, what are you doing in here?
What's wrong?

01:04:31.063 --> 01:04:32.264
Is it something I did?

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:51.617
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I messed up.

01:04:52.217 --> 01:04:53.352
No, baby.

01:04:54.854 --> 01:04:58.156
- No, it's not you.
- It's not you.

01:05:01.226 --> 01:05:03.228
I'm gonna try to be better,
I promise.

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:06.431
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.745 --> 01:05:20.512
Just like taking a candy
from a baby.

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:21.613
Right, Ms. McConnell?

01:05:23.783 --> 01:05:26.351
<i>No one's reacting.
He's not real.</i>

01:05:28.855 --> 01:05:29.889
Rain?

01:05:29.923 --> 01:05:32.124
- <i>Idiot.</i>
- <i>You're stupid.</i>

01:05:32.157 --> 01:05:33.592
<i>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</i>

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.193
<i>Rain. Rain.</i>

01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:39.097
<i>Rain? He's not real.</i>

01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:40.566
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:44.336
<i>You're stupid.</i>

01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:49.809
Don't forget to turn in
your papers,

01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:52.144
if you haven't done it already.

01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:19.839
Like whatever.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:40.459
Rain?

01:06:43.528 --> 01:06:45.230
Rain?

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:51.738
What are you doing here?

01:06:51.771 --> 01:06:53.605
- You've been ignoring me.
- Yeah.

01:06:54.339 --> 01:06:55.540
Yeah. And...

01:06:57.442 --> 01:06:59.478
I wasn't expecting
you would admit that.

01:06:59.511 --> 01:07:01.313
Yeah. Well, I did.
And I've been ignoring you

01:07:01.346 --> 01:07:03.582
- because you're not real.
- I am real.

01:07:03.615 --> 01:07:05.350
No, you're in prison.
You're a prism.

01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:07.219
What?

01:07:07.252 --> 01:07:08.553
Okay. Number one,
is it possible?

01:07:08.587 --> 01:07:09.421
No. The answer is no.

01:07:09.454 --> 01:07:11.390
No one like you exists
in real life.

01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:14.292
I do... And what makes you
think I'm not real?

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.729
You're just too perfect.

01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:20.800
What? Okay. That's a first.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.803
No, I...
You're like perfectly imperfect.

01:07:23.836 --> 01:07:27.372
I really don't wanna keep
talking about this with you.

01:07:27.406 --> 01:07:29.776
Well, too bad because now
I'm not going anywhere. I mean...

01:07:29.976 --> 01:07:31.811
This is bad enough
to find friends out here,

01:07:31.844 --> 01:07:32.544
much less...

01:07:32.979 --> 01:07:35.414
Stop. You need to go,
whether you're real or not.

01:07:35.447 --> 01:07:36.481
No, I am real.

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:37.684
And you're a little different,
yeah.

01:07:37.717 --> 01:07:39.584
I don't care about that.
I mean, I do, I...

01:07:39.618 --> 01:07:40.820
I care about it. I just...

01:07:41.788 --> 01:07:43.188
I like you.

01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:49.729
- What was that?
- What? You heard her?

01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:52.632
- I heard something.
- It was Malia!

01:07:52.665 --> 01:07:55.635
- Well, it could've been a cat.
- No, it wasn't a cat!

01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:57.704
We should call the police then.

01:07:57.737 --> 01:07:59.337
- No, I can't!
- Why not?

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:00.807
You just said
it could've been a cat.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.474
And if I'm wrong,
they'll put me away.

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:05.510
Okay. Well, what do you
want us what to do?

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.421
We're good.

01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:18.758
Through here. Come on.

01:08:29.568 --> 01:08:32.537
Hey. I think we can
get in through the garage.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.593
What's going on?

01:08:55.995 --> 01:08:58.596
- Enough is enough, John.
- Dani, what's going on?

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:00.365
It's one thing
when she's having issues,

01:09:00.398 --> 01:09:01.768
but now she's vandalizing
my home

01:09:01.801 --> 01:09:03.669
and making accusations
that could end my career.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.904
Slow down. What? What did...

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.907
I've worked my ass off
for my retirement,

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:09.975
I cannot afford
to have that jeopardized.

01:09:11.844 --> 01:09:13.377
What do you want me to do?

01:09:13.411 --> 01:09:16.082
- You know what you need to do.
- No. I really don't.

01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:19.685
You need to take her
into the hospital.

01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:21.553
Do you want me
just lock my kid up

01:09:21.888 --> 01:09:24.622
and just sweep her
under the rug?

01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:28.560
You know, I get
that you're in a tough place,

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:31.363
but if you don't take her in,
I'm filing charges.

01:09:31.563 --> 01:09:32.865
Excuse me, hold on a minute.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:35.500
- Dani, seriously.
- No, I... I'm done. I'm done.

01:09:35.935 --> 01:09:38.435
- Excuse me. Dani.
- I'm done!

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:40.038
- Dani, just...
- I can't.

01:09:41.372 --> 01:09:42.073
Please, just...

01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:48.345
<i>I told you
not to go over there.</i>

01:09:48.814 --> 01:09:50.049
- What were you thinking?
- John.

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:52.752
She has a giant doll house
in her garage.

01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:54.821
Yeah. She's got 100 dolls
in her attic.

01:09:54.854 --> 01:09:57.622
She's weird.
Who the hell cares?

01:09:57.924 --> 01:10:00.492
This is all part of her plan.
She's gonna trap her in there.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.962
- Are you listening to yourself?
- That's what she wants!

01:10:02.995 --> 01:10:04.496
She wants you to think
I'm crazy,

01:10:04.529 --> 01:10:05.798
so that can send me away.

01:10:05.832 --> 01:10:07.834
You broke
into somebody's house, Rain.

01:10:07.867 --> 01:10:08.668
I didn't break into it,

01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:10.468
- Caleb broke the window.
- Oh, Christ!

01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:11.938
This... This again.

01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:16.508
No, she only reported
seeing you.

01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:17.844
Well, she maybe just
didn't see him,

01:10:17.877 --> 01:10:19.578
but he was there.
He heard her scream!

01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:21.580
Caleb doesn't exist, okay?

01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:24.116
- Seriously, you need to stop.
- Stop? Stop what?

01:10:24.382 --> 01:10:26.652
If I wasn't sick,
you would never even be saying...

01:10:26.686 --> 01:10:28.620
- You are sick!
- But I'm not my sickness!

01:10:28.654 --> 01:10:31.691
Yes, you are! We all are!

01:10:41.701 --> 01:10:42.969
You're going to Westbrook.

01:10:43.002 --> 01:10:45.470
- Don't you dare say that!
- What? No!

01:10:45.838 --> 01:10:48.440
I've had enough of this.
You're both out of control.

01:10:50.643 --> 01:10:52.111
Have you been taking
your medicine?

01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:53.545
Yes.

01:10:59.185 --> 01:11:00.119
Have you?

01:11:02.788 --> 01:11:04.657
It doesn't matter
what I say anyways,

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:07.093
- you don't believe me.
- Come here. Come here.

01:11:07.525 --> 01:11:09.061
- Stop. Get off!
- Come here.

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.596
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:17.136
Take your medicine.

01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:19.872
Already taken it today.

01:11:20.973 --> 01:11:23.475
- Take another dose.
- No! Dad, stop!

01:11:23.508 --> 01:11:25.011
- What are you... Stop!
- Take it!

01:11:26.178 --> 01:11:29.048
Is this what you want, Dad?
You want me to take them all,

01:11:29.081 --> 01:11:30.650
- get out of your hair for good?
- What are you doing?

01:11:30.683 --> 01:11:31.751
Okay.

01:11:41.493 --> 01:11:43.428
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:47.499
Don't say that.

01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:54.106
Don't ever say that again.

01:11:59.812 --> 01:12:01.981
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

01:12:02.915 --> 01:12:03.916
I'm sorry.

01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:08.754
Sorry doesn't make it okay.

01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:27.539
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice of you to show up

01:12:27.572 --> 01:12:28.741
after your disappearing act.

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:30.910
What? You ran, I ran. And...

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.411
Well, she called the cops.

01:12:32.445 --> 01:12:34.579
She's filing charges
to have me sent away.

01:12:34.612 --> 01:12:35.748
What? Where?

01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:38.818
- I gotta go to class.
- No.

01:12:39.085 --> 01:12:40.886
If you leave,
what's gonna happen to Malia?

01:12:41.921 --> 01:12:43.756
You mean the cat next door?

01:13:23.929 --> 01:13:25.698
So, what's your plan?

01:13:26.665 --> 01:13:29.969
We can climb up the ladder
and break through the window.

01:13:30.503 --> 01:13:32.872
While she's home?
That's not gonna do any good.

01:13:32.905 --> 01:13:34.774
She will call the cops,
get us arrested.

01:13:34.807 --> 01:13:36.942
We have to do something
before she kills her. What...

01:13:37.609 --> 01:13:39.345
What makes you think
she's gonna kill her?

01:13:39.378 --> 01:13:41.213
She knows that I know!
She's gonna kill her

01:13:41.247 --> 01:13:42.048
and it's all gonna be my fault!

01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:43.615
and I'm gonna be the one
who just sit

01:13:43.649 --> 01:13:45.317
and even do anything to save her
or...

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:46.685
- Rain!
- I can't...

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:50.588
We need to come up
with a coherent plan, okay?

01:13:50.622 --> 01:13:51.556
Panicking is not gonna help.

01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:57.029
Let me get you some water,
all right?

01:14:08.174 --> 01:14:09.141
Wrong one.

01:14:11.777 --> 01:14:12.978
You take all these?

01:14:13.913 --> 01:14:14.680
Not exactly.

01:14:14.713 --> 01:14:17.116
They're constantly
changing them up

01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:18.317
to see what's most effective.

01:14:18.751 --> 01:14:20.653
I can't sleep
on any of them, though.

01:14:21.153 --> 01:14:22.620
Studies have found strong links

01:14:22.655 --> 01:14:24.790
between insomnia
and intellect, so.

01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:29.195
And I'm sure that's what it is.
Just me being a genius.

01:14:40.206 --> 01:14:41.974
How can you
be playing cards right now?

01:14:43.742 --> 01:14:44.910
It helps me when I'm nervous.

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:46.879
Here...

01:14:47.947 --> 01:14:48.981
try it again, pick one.

01:14:52.852 --> 01:14:53.819
Nope.

01:14:59.058 --> 01:15:00.025
You pick one.

01:15:01.694 --> 01:15:03.062
Yeah? What are you gonna do
with those?

01:15:03.095 --> 01:15:04.096
Just pick a card.

01:15:15.174 --> 01:15:17.042
- Rain?
- Yeah, Mom?

01:15:17.276 --> 01:15:18.244
Hey, hi.

01:15:20.012 --> 01:15:22.281
I'm sorry. Who is this?

01:15:23.048 --> 01:15:25.985
Um, this is Caleb.
Caleb, this is my mom.

01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:29.321
Wait, you can see him?

01:15:30.256 --> 01:15:31.423
Of course I can see him.

01:15:34.994 --> 01:15:37.296
I was so nervous of...
Never mind.

01:15:38.063 --> 01:15:39.865
Don't let me interrupt
your date.

01:15:39.899 --> 01:15:40.966
It's not a date, Mom.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.134
- We're just friends.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:45.738 --> 01:15:47.873
I don't think we should wait.
Let's go Wednesday, after...

01:15:47.907 --> 01:15:50.943
You know, actually, I...
I gotta go.

01:15:52.878 --> 01:15:55.915
But I'll, uh...
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah?

01:15:56.115 --> 01:15:57.149
Okay. Yeah.

01:16:06.325 --> 01:16:07.693
Did I ruin your date?

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.993
All right. All right,
guys, come on. You're late.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.795
Come on in. Take a seat.

01:16:43.796 --> 01:16:44.830
Let's get started.

01:16:47.466 --> 01:16:48.767
<i>I told you.</i>

01:16:50.169 --> 01:16:51.470
- <i>I told you.</i>
- Rain?

01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:53.539
<i>He's not real.</i>

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:57.076
<i>I told you.
He's not real.</i>

01:16:57.476 --> 01:16:59.078
<i>He's not real.</i>

01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:01.814
- <i>Loser.</i>
- <i>Rain.</i>

01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:05.417
<i>Kill yourself.</i>

01:17:06.885 --> 01:17:08.187
Rain?

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:11.924
No, no! Rain.
Rain, are you okay?

01:17:15.261 --> 01:17:16.862
Rain, can we talk for a moment?

01:17:17.062 --> 01:17:18.831
<i>You should just die.</i>

01:17:20.266 --> 01:17:21.867
<i>No one likes you.</i>

01:17:26.105 --> 01:17:29.308
<i>Freak. Freak.
Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak.</i>

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:32.544
<i>You're a freak.
You should kill yourself.</i>

01:17:35.514 --> 01:17:36.548
Rain?

01:17:38.117 --> 01:17:40.185
I think you need to go
see the nurse.

01:17:40.519 --> 01:17:42.921
<i>You're crazy.
You're crazy.</i>

01:18:21.026 --> 01:18:22.161
<i>Hi. You've reached</i>

01:18:22.194 --> 01:18:23.262
<i>the Burroughs residence.</i>

01:18:33.572 --> 01:18:36.008
Hi, I... I need to talk
to Dr. Pangloss.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.876
She's over at the hospital,
Ms. Burroughs.

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:39.378
But I can let her know
you wanna speak to her.

01:18:39.411 --> 01:18:41.213
Um, no, I need to see her now.

01:18:41.246 --> 01:18:42.448
- Sorry.
- She's not here.

01:18:44.684 --> 01:18:49.855
Dr. Pangloss! Dr. Pangloss!
Dr. Pangloss!

01:18:55.494 --> 01:18:56.428
Rain!

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:02.034
<i>Rain!</i>

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:14.980
- <i>Save me.</i>
- <i>Rain. Rain.</i>

01:19:16.482 --> 01:19:21.487
<i>âª Rain, Rain, go away
Come again another day âª</i>

01:20:01.326 --> 01:20:04.563
<i>You're crazy.</i>

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:06.565
- <i>You're crazy.</i>
- <i>Get it together.</i>

01:20:06.866 --> 01:20:08.200
<i>You're losing it.</i>

01:20:08.735 --> 01:20:09.669
She's not real.

01:20:14.072 --> 01:20:15.642
She's gonna die
and you're gonna be locked up

01:20:15.675 --> 01:20:18.645
where you belong.
They're better off without you.

01:20:18.678 --> 01:20:19.978
<i>Get it together.</i>

01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:21.346
- Stop!
- Stop!

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.548
Stop!

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:25.551
Rain, honey?

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:30.956
Rain.

01:20:31.256 --> 01:20:32.558
Rain, sweetheart.

01:20:36.228 --> 01:20:37.529
I saw a man
with yellow eyes.

01:20:37.563 --> 01:20:39.598
He wants to take me
as his prize.

01:20:39.632 --> 01:20:41.200
Cries. Cries. She cries.

01:20:41.233 --> 01:20:43.001
Cry me a river
and watch me drown.

01:20:43.035 --> 01:20:46.472
- No sound, it's all too loud.
- No, no, sweetheart.

01:20:47.105 --> 01:20:48.574
Put it down. Put it down.

01:20:50.275 --> 01:20:52.444
Okay. All right.

01:20:52.478 --> 01:20:54.046
You're okay.

01:20:54.714 --> 01:20:56.749
You're okay, you're safe.

01:20:57.115 --> 01:21:00.185
You're safe. You're safe.
You're safe. You're safe.

01:21:00.385 --> 01:21:02.488
Sweetheart, you're safe.

01:21:02.722 --> 01:21:05.692
- Wait, Malia, Malia.
- No. No, Rain. Rain!

01:21:25.745 --> 01:21:28.347
- No, I won't let you.
- Won't let me what, Mom?

01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:30.082
This is your fault
in the first place!

01:21:30.115 --> 01:21:31.116
I wouldn't be dealing
with any of this,

01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:34.353
if you hadn't made me sick!
I'm... I hate you.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.289
Rain, please.

01:21:38.056 --> 01:21:41.293
Please, if you go over there,
they will take you away from us.

01:21:41.326 --> 01:21:43.796
I don't care. What if it was me?
I'm not just gonna sit here

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.698
- and wait.
- No. No. Rain!

01:21:50.369 --> 01:21:52.504
- Rain? Open the door!
- Mom's making a big deal

01:21:52.538 --> 01:21:55.240
- out of this, and I've got this.
- We need to talk.

01:21:57.276 --> 01:21:58.678
Move away from the window,
please.

01:21:58.711 --> 01:22:00.479
I'm not gonna jump, Dad!
I was just...

01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:03.148
- Honey, listen to your dad.
- You ruin everything!

01:22:04.283 --> 01:22:05.551
There's no one there.

01:22:05.584 --> 01:22:07.619
Yeah. She is! She's right there.

01:22:07.654 --> 01:22:08.554
Your mom...

01:22:14.393 --> 01:22:15.394
She's not here.

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:22.434
She passed away
three years ago, baby.

01:22:25.805 --> 01:22:27.205
No. That's not true.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:30.643
- It's true. I'm sorry.
- Why are you doing this to me?

01:22:30.677 --> 01:22:34.179
I'm not doing anything to you.
You need to know the truth.

01:22:34.814 --> 01:22:36.148
What about at dinner?

01:22:36.515 --> 01:22:37.784
She was there.
We were all there.

01:22:37.817 --> 01:22:40.619
Was anyone else reacting?
Yes, Dad. Yes, you were.

01:22:40.653 --> 01:22:42.487
- You were reacting.
- Because I was trying...

01:22:42.755 --> 01:22:44.222
Dad, she's coming! Distract her.

01:22:44.256 --> 01:22:45.257
- Right, right.
- What's going on?

01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:46.358
Nothing, Mom.

01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:48.126
Look...

01:22:50.529 --> 01:22:51.798
I was just trying to...

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:54.634
This whole time?

01:22:56.836 --> 01:22:57.502
Mom's coming.

01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:58.705
<i>I didn't know
what to do...</i>

01:22:58.738 --> 01:22:59.438
Right, right.

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:00.606
<i>...when you started
seeing her again.</i>

01:23:00.907 --> 01:23:03.710
- Nothing to see here.
- Nothing, Mom. Don't come in.

01:23:05.678 --> 01:23:06.646
Coast is clear.

01:23:07.145 --> 01:23:10.248
I tried to remind you
that she was gone,

01:23:10.282 --> 01:23:14.286
but it was really, really hard
seeing you relive that loss

01:23:15.021 --> 01:23:18.256
<i>over and over and over again.</i>

01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:21.460
Yeah, Mom?

01:23:22.862 --> 01:23:24.262
<i>But after a while...</i>

01:23:25.732 --> 01:23:31.169
your reality with her
was just so much...

01:23:31.203 --> 01:23:32.604
<i>It was so much happier...</i>

01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:35.742
<i>than mine without her.</i>

01:23:38.477 --> 01:23:42.481
And I was... I was...

01:23:42.882 --> 01:23:44.282
I was so afraid.

01:23:45.752 --> 01:23:49.521
I was just so terrified
that you... That you...

01:23:50.957 --> 01:23:52.659
That you would wanna go...

01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:56.729
to be with her.

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:03.602
How do I know
you're not lying to me? Hmm?

01:24:04.037 --> 01:24:06.873
- Rain...
- How do I know you're not

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:10.475
- just messing with my head?
- Why would I do that?

01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:11.878
Why'd you lie to me
in the beginning?

01:24:11.911 --> 01:24:14.647
You're just trying to get
to my head.

01:24:15.081 --> 01:24:20.218
- Stop fucking with my head!
- Just stop! Stop!

01:24:20.787 --> 01:24:22.789
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling 911.

01:24:22.822 --> 01:24:26.693
- No! Stop!
- Rain! Rain! Come back!

01:24:29.628 --> 01:24:30.629
Rain!

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:44.443
Malia is already dead!

01:24:45.544 --> 01:24:46.979
<i>Don't listen to her.</i>

01:24:47.013 --> 01:24:48.848
- <i>She's lying.</i>
- <i>This is your fault.</i>

01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:50.950
- <i>She's lying.</i>
- <i>Do something.</i>

01:24:58.758 --> 01:24:59.859
<i>She's lying.</i>

01:25:28.788 --> 01:25:30.288
<i>Help me.</i>

01:26:04.422 --> 01:26:06.458
Shit.

01:26:11.898 --> 01:26:12.899
Malia?

01:26:15.467 --> 01:26:16.468
Help.

01:26:17.170 --> 01:26:19.872
- <i>Help her!</i>
- <i>You can still see her!</i>

01:26:35.087 --> 01:26:36.088
Malia?

01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:42.728
It's okay.
I'm here to help you.

01:26:43.896 --> 01:26:45.064
Save me.

01:26:46.598 --> 01:26:49.035
- Save me.
- Stop.

01:26:49.635 --> 01:26:52.839
No, no, you're not real.
I need to save Malia.

01:26:53.072 --> 01:26:55.641
There is no Malia!
It's always been me.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.810
<i>You should kill yourself.</i>

01:26:57.844 --> 01:27:00.378
No, no, no, no. She's real.

01:27:01.647 --> 01:27:02.715
She's real.

01:27:30.609 --> 01:27:32.979
- You did this...
- No, no.

01:27:33.012 --> 01:27:33.980
...to me.

01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:37.884
Look at me.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.824
You can't leave me.

01:27:45.523 --> 01:27:46.926
I don't want to.

01:27:48.728 --> 01:27:51.931
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to go away.

01:27:53.866 --> 01:27:55.500
I don't have to.

01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:03.876
I don't wanna be crazy, Mom.

01:28:10.482 --> 01:28:13.085
- <i>Help me.</i>
- Malia?

01:28:15.154 --> 01:28:16.889
She's made up, Rain.

01:28:23.763 --> 01:28:25.497
No, she's not, Mom.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.801
You are.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.961
Hi.

01:30:01.994 --> 01:30:02.962
Here's your order.

01:30:02.995 --> 01:30:03.996
Thanks.

01:30:06.932 --> 01:30:09.201
- Keep the change.
- Have a good one.

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:21.200
<i>It's too late.
It's too late. She's dead.</i>

01:32:21.233 --> 01:32:23.169
<i>It's too late. It's too late.</i>

01:32:25.771 --> 01:32:27.206
- <i>You killed her.</i>
- <i>It's too late.</i>

01:32:27.239 --> 01:32:28.274
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

01:32:28.507 --> 01:32:31.443
- <i>You're too late.</i>
- <i>Save Malia.</i>

01:32:31.477 --> 01:32:33.078
<i>It's not too late.</i>

01:32:35.381 --> 01:32:37.082
- <i>Don't do it.</i>
- <i>Go back.</i>

01:32:37.483 --> 01:32:38.817
<i>Keep going.</i>

01:32:39.151 --> 01:32:41.887
<i>No. Stop! Stop it!</i>

01:33:51.423 --> 01:33:54.226
Malia, are you here?

01:33:58.998 --> 01:34:00.933
Malia. Malia, hi.

01:34:00.966 --> 01:34:02.268
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

01:34:02.301 --> 01:34:04.970
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Okay.

01:34:34.533 --> 01:34:35.434
Ah!

01:34:43.242 --> 01:34:45.544
Hello?
Is anybody down there?

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:13.572
Hello?

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.056
Oh! Oh.

01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:33.459
Oh, gosh. Rain,
you scared the hell out of me.

01:35:34.126 --> 01:35:35.160
Oh, gosh.

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:40.933
Oh! Here, let me help you.

01:35:41.433 --> 01:35:42.935
<i>Don't trust her.</i>

01:35:44.937 --> 01:35:45.938
Here.

01:35:47.406 --> 01:35:50.342
Rain, take my hand.
That's right.

01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:53.345
I don't want anything
to hurt you.

01:35:53.379 --> 01:35:55.948
- <i>You can't trust her.</i>
- <i>You can trust her.</i>

01:35:56.348 --> 01:35:58.117
- It's okay.
- <i>You're just gonna die.</i>

01:35:58.150 --> 01:36:00.219
She's not real, Rain.

01:36:00.986 --> 01:36:04.089
- There's no one there, Rain.
- <i>She's lying.</i>

01:36:04.123 --> 01:36:06.091
There's no little girl there.

01:36:06.726 --> 01:36:08.894
- <i>Either one of you.</i>
- <i>Save Malia.</i>

01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:10.596
Malia, Malia, come here,

01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:11.964
come here. Come here, come here.

01:36:12.464 --> 01:36:14.500
<i>Wait. Don't do this.
She's gone.</i>

01:36:14.701 --> 01:36:18.070
She's not real, Rain.
You made her up in your head.

01:36:18.103 --> 01:36:19.371
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

01:36:20.406 --> 01:36:21.607
<i>Don't you do this.</i>

01:36:22.141 --> 01:36:24.543
- <i>Listen to me.</i>
- <i>Liar!</i>

01:36:24.576 --> 01:36:26.612
- <i>She's a liar, Rain.</i>
- Put that down.

01:36:26.646 --> 01:36:28.514
<i>There's something wrong
with you, Rain. Just...</i>

01:36:28.547 --> 01:36:30.516
- <i>You're the crazy one.</i>
- <i>You're crazy.</i>

01:36:31.016 --> 01:36:32.618
- <i>You're gonna die.</i>
- Let me help you.

01:36:33.552 --> 01:36:36.121
Come on. Come on.

01:36:38.323 --> 01:36:40.492
Come on. Let me help you.

01:36:50.302 --> 01:36:51.603
Does your dad know you're here?

01:36:52.538 --> 01:36:54.473
I don't... I don't think so. No.

01:36:54.506 --> 01:36:55.974
I don't have to tell him.

01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:58.711
We can just keep this
between us, okay?

01:36:59.511 --> 01:37:01.213
Why would you do that?

01:37:01.246 --> 01:37:02.414
Because I know what happens

01:37:02.448 --> 01:37:03.582
when they
institutionalize people

01:37:03.615 --> 01:37:05.217
and I don't want that
happening to you.

01:37:05.951 --> 01:37:08.454
You have been through
so much already.

01:37:08.688 --> 01:37:11.123
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

01:37:12.659 --> 01:37:14.661
You've seen that she's not real.

01:37:15.594 --> 01:37:17.296
There's no little girl.

01:37:21.166 --> 01:37:24.737
You can just go on home
and we'll keep this between us.

01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:26.673
- Okay?
- Rain?

01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:30.409
Caleb, don't come down here.

01:37:30.609 --> 01:37:34.046
Who are you talking to, Rain?
There's no one there.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:40.185
This is your head.

01:37:40.452 --> 01:37:43.622
This is...

01:37:44.022 --> 01:37:45.725
Go, Rain,
get her out of here!

01:37:54.099 --> 01:37:55.567
Make a decision, Rain.

01:37:55.601 --> 01:37:57.536
A figment of your imagination,
or the real thing?

01:38:08.681 --> 01:38:12.752
No, no! No!

01:38:13.151 --> 01:38:15.454
You think I was gonna let you
get away with this?

01:38:15.487 --> 01:38:16.756
I would've let you go.

01:38:17.322 --> 01:38:20.793
I don't want anyone to die.
But you couldn't let things be.

01:38:24.596 --> 01:38:26.498
Get her out of here, Rain!

01:38:38.878 --> 01:38:40.145
Rain.

01:38:40.345 --> 01:38:42.749
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
It's just me.

01:38:44.651 --> 01:38:47.252
It's just me.
You're safe.

01:38:49.388 --> 01:38:51.290
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:38:51.323 --> 01:38:52.324
She's real?

01:38:54.192 --> 01:38:55.662
Come on, come on, come on.

01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:01.133
I need to go back inside.
Caleb's...

01:39:01.166 --> 01:39:02.301
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:39:02.501 --> 01:39:04.303
I got you. I got you.

01:39:05.571 --> 01:39:08.273
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:39:09.441 --> 01:39:11.109
I need to go back inside.

01:39:11.143 --> 01:39:12.477
- Caleb...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:39:12.511 --> 01:39:15.180
He's not real, Rain.
He's not real.

01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:19.852
Call EMT.

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.187
Hey, there.

01:39:22.722 --> 01:39:23.723
You all right?

01:39:30.162 --> 01:39:30.964
He is real.

01:39:31.196 --> 01:39:32.531
Check out
the neighbor's house.

01:39:34.299 --> 01:39:35.702
Hey, we got
another one over here.

01:39:37.569 --> 01:39:38.503
I love you.

01:39:39.438 --> 01:39:40.707
I'm so proud of you, monkey.

01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:47.814
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:39:47.847 --> 01:39:49.514
They're gonna
take good care of you,

01:39:49.548 --> 01:39:51.884
get you back to your mom
and dad. Okay? I promise.

01:39:52.652 --> 01:39:54.252
You're such
a brave girl.

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:04.731
Hi.

01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:07.232
When you said
that wasn't a date,

01:40:07.265 --> 01:40:08.233
what did you, uh...

01:40:08.968 --> 01:40:10.302
What did you mean?

01:40:10.602 --> 01:40:11.738
Because it felt kinda...

01:40:12.939 --> 01:40:14.406
I don't know, datey to me.

01:40:15.374 --> 01:40:17.376
- Did it?
- Yeah.

01:40:18.111 --> 01:40:20.479
I mean, granted I don't have
that much experience...

01:40:21.613 --> 01:40:22.949
with that sort of thing, but...

01:40:22.982 --> 01:40:25.550
You mean, like, dates?

01:40:25.584 --> 01:40:26.618
Yeah.

01:40:27.185 --> 01:40:30.489
But maybe
we can have some more of them...

01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:32.659
when I'm out of this?

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.895
Hmm.
We could maybe arrange that.

01:40:37.295 --> 01:40:39.364
I'd like that. Personally.

01:40:53.245 --> 01:40:56.348
For the first time,
I can feel the medicine working.

01:40:58.517 --> 01:40:59.652
I can finally tell
the difference

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:01.453
between what's real
and what's not.

01:41:05.858 --> 01:41:07.760
But do you still hear
the voices and...

01:41:08.728 --> 01:41:11.363
Yeah. They're still there,
but not as, like...

01:41:14.801 --> 01:41:16.334
But yeah.

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:18.905
What about mom?

01:41:21.273 --> 01:41:22.340
Do you still see her?

01:41:27.579 --> 01:41:28.580
No.

01:41:34.821 --> 01:41:35.988
I miss her.

01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.009
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

01:41:58.778 --> 01:42:00.579
I think I'm gonna move back
into my room.

01:42:00.847 --> 01:42:01.981
Oh, okay.

01:42:03.816 --> 01:42:04.884
Sounds like a plan.

01:42:54.499 --> 01:42:55.668
I'm here, baby girl.

01:42:58.004 --> 01:42:59.504
I love you so, so much.

01:43:00.673 --> 01:43:01.874
I love you, too.
