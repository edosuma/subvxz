it.

You'll find a shaft. Left at the top.

Tiffin: Hear that?

That's your heart.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.172
What?

05:44.260 --> 05:45.932
Feel it.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.451
- Says who?
- Well, ask anyone.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.496
Best billiard players,
best horsemen, miners...

06:47.580 --> 06:48.569
bullshitters?

06:48.660 --> 06:50.855
Keep a lid on it, you blokes.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.533
Righto.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.891
Tiffin! Hey, get up!

10:25.980 --> 10:27.891
Get up.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.212

(shell explodes)

10:33.460 --> 10:36.338
(tiffin breathes rapidly)

10:40.820 --> 10:42.731
This is an officer's dugout.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.412
Woodward?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.579
Bob clayton, northumberland
fusiliers.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.969
Oliver woodward,
1st australian tunnellers.

10:58.060 --> 11:00.016
An explosive man, right, woody?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.409
Could blow up at any time. (laughs)

11:03.700 --> 11:05.850
(tiffin cries out)

11:05.940 --> 11:07.419
Mcbride: How long you been here?

11:08.420 --> 11:11.492
Two days. It feels like a year.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.930
(tiffin sobs quietly)

11:20.020 --> 11:22.250
Woodward: We nearly came a-gutser.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.138
A fritz machine gunner
got a bead on us.

11:25.220 --> 11:27.814
Yeah, it's boris. It's a farm
building.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.333
They call it the red house.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.899
Clayton: Solid as bloody gibraltar.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.214
(cries loudly)

11:42.300 --> 11:44.097
They have their own dugouts, you
know.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.732
A bit of air will see him right.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.177
You got a home, son?

11:52.460 --> 11:54.690
Wollongong, sir.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.577
Coal miner?

11:58.940 --> 12:01.374
- Gold, right?
- Silver, lead. Broken hill.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.530
- (loud explosion)
- (tiffin sobs)

12:05.820 --> 12:07.572
Sweetheart?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.579
Wife.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.775
Wife?

12:16.860 --> 12:18.418
Sweetheart.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.691
You got a photograph, tiffin?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.139
She's, um...

12:37.220 --> 12:38.699
tiffin: My mum, sir.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.373
(mcbride laughs)

12:46.820 --> 12:48.378
(mcbride and woodward laugh)

12:48.460 --> 12:50.928
You're not even real soldiers, are
you?

12:55.540 --> 12:58.532
Tunnelling under german lines.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.133
Protecting your trenches.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.371
Your point being?

13:11.580 --> 13:12.979
And shot at from in front.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.459
Now they're being mined
from underneath.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.768
(tiffin cries)

13:15.860 --> 13:17.259
If the man is wounded, woodward,

13:21.500 --> 13:22.979
either way, he shouldn't be here.

13:23.980 --> 13:25.698
If you want my opinion,
neither should you.

13:25.780 --> 13:28.578
(tiffin continues crying)

13:34.260 --> 13:36.251
Good to feel wanted, eh, tiffin?

13:37.780 --> 13:39.452
Wouldn't like to think we were over
here

13:39.540 --> 13:41.417
putting our arses on the line
for nothing.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.658
Hides it well.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.095
People do.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.212
Seems a shame to waste this.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.733
(shell explodes)

13:56.820 --> 13:59.459
(cries out)

14:01.260 --> 14:03.330
(chuckles) oh, rather!

14:04.460 --> 14:07.338
- (explosion)
- (cries) mama!

14:07.420 --> 14:10.571
It's alright, tiffin. It's alright,
son.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.411
(cicadas hum)

14:22.540 --> 14:24.735
(whip bird calls)

14:34.860 --> 14:37.613
Hello? Is anybody home?

14:44.780 --> 14:46.259
They don't belong to you, do they?

14:46.340 --> 14:48.570
Oliver, is that you?

14:48.660 --> 14:50.537
Mrs waddell.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.258
Colin, gordon, round the back.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.699
I was hoping i might catch moffat.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.819
Light horse?

15:03.900 --> 15:05.333
Mrs waddell: Of course.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.653
(laughs)

15:15.020 --> 15:16.897
I could have stayed there forever.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.178
We want to hear all your stories.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.852
Woodward: Come on, mate.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.139
Is that you, isabel?

15:32.620 --> 15:34.531
At school, we called him ‘captain'.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.533
And were there complaints?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.736
- No, sir.
- No.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.293
- Woody, woody, woody!
- Yes?

15:46.620 --> 15:48.656
- Can he really?
- Watch.

15:48.740 --> 15:53.530
One, two, three, four, five,

15:53.620 --> 15:57.090
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

15:57.180 --> 15:58.932
where's he posted now.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.454
Well, we don't know. Egypt, we think.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.019
...sixteen, seventeen...

16:10.900 --> 16:12.299
well, it's copper for the war effort.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.171
...38, 39...
- girl: Woody!

16:31.660 --> 16:33.059
And it's mr woodward.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.938
- Marjorie.
- Mr woodward.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.579
I'll be working at mt morgan mine

16:46.900 --> 16:48.618
(laughs)

16:52.500 --> 16:54.300
- They make them for kids.
- No, it's beautiful.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.018
I love it. Thank you.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.337
Doesn't he look wonderful?

17:05.260 --> 17:07.569
- Emma: It's mr...
- mr woodward.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.333
Yes.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.132
May i have some tea, please, mama?

17:14.220 --> 17:17.132
Yes, if you refill the milk jug
first.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.534
Marjorie: Yes, mama.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.931
She's so grown-up.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.533
Well, she thinks so

17:37.220 --> 17:38.539
(glass shatters)

17:38.620 --> 17:40.133
Marjorie: It's alright.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.972
What now.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.491
And my left flank moves forward...

17:53.580 --> 17:55.013
- mr woodward?
- Yes?

17:58.180 --> 18:00.774
Bad luck, they reckon.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.213
Well, that's good

18:05.540 --> 18:07.258
it must feel awfully claustrophobic.

18:07.340 --> 18:10.218
It's funny. I quite like it down
there.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.939
Really? Why?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.976
Snug.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.494
Hmm. Snug.

18:21.340 --> 18:23.331
- (spits loudly)
- Marjorie!

18:23.420 --> 18:26.537
- Sorry, i...
- are you ok?

18:26.620 --> 18:28.292
Yes, i just...

18:28.380 --> 18:30.894
just go and clean yourself up
immediately.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.569
I'm so sorry.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.859
16 is a very difficult age.

18:49.060 --> 18:50.459
- You promise me?
- I promise.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.768
Right.

18:56.660 --> 18:59.811
Of course. Think nothing of it.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.418
Well, goodbye, all.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.569
Oh!

19:07.660 --> 19:10.458
(horse whinnies)

19:10.540 --> 19:12.656
(laughs)

19:19.460 --> 19:21.337
He got into the lucerne this morning

19:27.500 --> 19:28.615
(laughs)

19:28.700 --> 19:31.168
So, when i arrived i loosened the
girth.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.650
Are you sure you're not injured?

19:38.740 --> 19:40.935
No, i'm fine, honestly.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.296
Thank you for the tea, mrs waddell.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.098
Mr waddell.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.296
Oliver.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.252
Isabel.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.174
(bird chirps)

20:15.380 --> 20:16.654
Anything?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.493
It's just making it darker.

20:24.580 --> 20:28.060
It's not the candle, pull through.
It's the air.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.893
Not enough oxygen for it to burn.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.096
(breathes heavily)

20:38.180 --> 20:41.411
Oh, jesus christ!

20:41.500 --> 20:43.377
Could be worse.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.928
Well, they could send us to hill 60.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.533
What's hill 60?

20:56.740 --> 20:58.970
Fritz has got the high ground.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.058
That's just talk, probably.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.973
(bird chirps)

21:14.060 --> 21:15.459
Shush, you little bugger.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.371
You'll get us all killed.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.179
Norm...

21:25.540 --> 21:27.417
- (gunshot)
- Aarggh!

21:27.500 --> 21:31.618
(gunfire)

21:32.620 --> 21:35.009
Aarggh!

21:35.100 --> 21:38.058
Aaaarggh!

21:44.140 --> 21:46.096
(man gurgles)

21:46.180 --> 21:49.616
(man sobs)

21:56.340 --> 21:57.693
Tom: Oh, my god.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.089
Howd you know it wasn't me?

22:00.180 --> 22:02.171
Lucky guess.

22:02.260 --> 22:04.490
Jesus christ.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.496
Is he dead?

22:30.020 --> 22:32.136
Call it even, eh, tommo?

22:32.220 --> 22:34.290
(chuckles)

22:41.820 --> 22:43.458
(pigeon coos)

22:43.540 --> 22:46.896
(explosion)

22:46.980 --> 22:48.857
- Shit!
- (phone rings)

22:53.020 --> 22:54.533
Mcbride.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.772
Location?

22:57.860 --> 22:59.657
Say again.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.810
How many?

23:04.100 --> 23:05.658
Right.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.970
102 drive has been crumped.

23:21.580 --> 23:22.933
Casualties?

23:23.020 --> 23:26.808
Two missing - um, morris and dwyer.

23:33.820 --> 23:37.449
(breathes noisily)

23:41.380 --> 23:43.769
Hows the air?

23:43.860 --> 23:45.498
(bird chirps)

23:55.700 --> 23:58.498
If they were near the face...

24:01.220 --> 24:02.938
...they may have found an air pocket.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.295
This strata holds up sometimes.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.939
(sniffs and spits loudly)

24:12.020 --> 24:15.535
It's pointless -
the whole miserable stunt.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.611
- (bird chirps)
- Lively, boys.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.896
Steel soles.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.572
German.

24:36.660 --> 24:40.858
Stupid pricks.
Hear 'em coming a mile off.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.694
(breathes heavily and coughs)

24:44.780 --> 24:46.338
- Man: Mate?
- I need you to move back.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.853
Mate, are you alright?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.577
(breathes noisily)

24:57.660 --> 24:59.412
Help me here.

25:11.980 --> 25:13.379
Man: Aarggh!

25:13.460 --> 25:15.052
It's tommo.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.378
(man coughs)

25:41.460 --> 25:43.212
Shh!

25:43.300 --> 25:47.293
(man coughs)

25:52.940 --> 25:55.852
Hang on, pull through. We'll just...

25:55.940 --> 25:57.339
easy.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.413
Watch out for your specs.

26:03.500 --> 26:07.413
- Easy. Easy.
- (coughs)

26:07.500 --> 26:10.731
(vomits)

26:19.740 --> 26:23.813
(speaks inaudibly)

26:23.900 --> 26:25.777
Woodward: Morris,
can you hear me?

26:28.340 --> 26:31.650
(speaks inaudibly)

26:31.740 --> 26:34.573
(breathes rapidly) tommo?

26:34.660 --> 26:36.378
- Tommo!
- Morris, can you hear me?

26:36.460 --> 26:38.655
Tommo! Tommo's in there.

26:38.740 --> 26:43.768
There's a man buried.
Tommo! Tommo! No!

26:49.620 --> 26:51.178
(pull through coughs)

26:56.620 --> 26:57.814
Come on, pull through.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.450
One arrives nearly every day -

27:12.540 --> 27:17.136
no stamp, no return address,
of course.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.653
But what do they mean?

27:18.740 --> 27:20.776
That i'm a coward.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.653
Shush now, marjorie.

27:26.420 --> 27:27.773
Marjorie: So, you agree with them?

27:30.420 --> 27:32.775
On the contrary,
just a few more feathers

27:32.860 --> 27:34.213
and i'll have a whole chicken.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.177
- (laughs)
- Waddell: Isabel!

27:42.460 --> 27:43.939
Marjorie: Are you missing papua?

27:48.740 --> 27:50.731
I worry about the local workers.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.773
If they send the german fleet down...

27:59.540 --> 28:02.179
(knock on door)

28:11.900 --> 28:13.538
Marjorie, clear away the plates now.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.019
Yes, mama.

28:27.260 --> 28:29.137
Best put those back, woody.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.620
(boy speaks indistinctly)

28:41.860 --> 28:43.532
William...

28:46.940 --> 28:48.771
it's moffat.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.328
Marjorie: Mama?

28:56.540 --> 28:59.930
Isabel, boys, come on. Now, please.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.211
William, tell me.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.770
It's not good news, i'm afraid.

29:49.260 --> 29:51.774
It's just cliffs, isn't it?

29:53.700 --> 29:55.816
Is it not all just cliffs?

29:59.860 --> 30:01.851
I don't know, sir.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.298
I don't know.

30:31.820 --> 30:33.299
Marjorie.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.859
You don't have to go to the war.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.335
I just couldn't bear it.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.888
(sobs)

31:15.060 --> 31:16.493
(man yells indistinctly)

31:17.660 --> 31:18.888
Fraser: The point is...

31:25.420 --> 31:26.899
been there in the bloody first place.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.698
Tiffin: Still don't know
what i heard, but.

31:30.340 --> 31:32.251
Maybe it really was me heart.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.932
Maybe i never heard no germans.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.339
Of course you heard 'em.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.092
Don't make no difference.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.614
(footsteps tread heavily)

31:43.860 --> 31:46.135
- Oh, fuck, man.
- (all laugh)

31:46.220 --> 31:47.733
Good on you, streaky.

31:47.820 --> 31:49.572
Courtesy of
the northumberland fusiliers.

31:51.820 --> 31:54.015
Probably not a good idea, corp.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.295
(all laugh)

32:10.540 --> 32:11.939
Man: Mmm.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.419
Tiffin?

32:20.580 --> 32:22.935
- We wasn't.
- Well, we was.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.090
Well, you was. You said.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.053
And that's why we kept digging.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.416
Won't be the last either.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.536
- He's alright, he is.
- Yeah?

32:41.620 --> 32:43.099
Then why'd he join late?

32:46.780 --> 32:48.372
I was over here, killing germans,

32:48.460 --> 32:51.372
months before
his fuckin' number was dry.

32:51.460 --> 32:53.098
Evening.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.171
Woodward: Stay there.

32:55.260 --> 32:58.252
Surprised to see you here.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.217
Me hearing came back.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.898
Too bad.

33:04.980 --> 33:07.733
- Smoke?
- Yeah, thanks.

33:29.820 --> 33:31.094
It's bad luck.

33:36.220 --> 33:38.370
First one, fritz sniper sees you.

33:38.460 --> 33:40.291
Second one, he gets an aim.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.292
Third one, he blows
your fuckin' head off.

33:46.340 --> 33:47.853
(scattered laughter)

33:55.060 --> 33:58.018
I'll be writing to tom dwyer's
family.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.371
Officer approaching! Attention!

34:09.900 --> 34:12.572
- Woodward?
- Yes, sir?

34:12.659 --> 34:15.379
I understand you're a demolition man.

34:15.460 --> 34:18.132
I'm trained in mining explosives,
sir, not...

34:18.219 --> 34:19.572
you're aware that the germans

34:21.500 --> 34:22.978
such that they can enfilade our
trench?

34:23.060 --> 34:25.494
En... enfilade?

34:25.580 --> 34:27.138
Fire down it lengthwise.

34:27.219 --> 34:28.733
Oh, yes, sir.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.813
Depends where you placed it, sir.

34:36.179 --> 34:39.536
(men shout in the distance)

34:39.620 --> 34:40.973
50 pounds.

34:47.179 --> 34:49.614
That'd put you about 70 foot from
boris.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.219
Let's have it done before sun-up,
0400.

35:02.020 --> 35:04.170
I'll have the artillery
give you one hour.

35:04.260 --> 35:07.138
- Sir.
- Sir!

35:22.860 --> 35:24.532
(men laugh)

35:28.780 --> 35:31.135
...crossing no-man's-land,
setting a charge.

35:32.580 --> 35:34.571
I'll need two men.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.659
I'll go, sir.

35:39.740 --> 35:41.332
- You don't have to, morris.
- Want to, sir.

35:46.580 --> 35:48.059
Fraser: Sit down, tiffin.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.576
I'll go.

36:01.580 --> 36:05.334
(explosions and gunfire)

36:05.420 --> 36:07.251
Here.

36:17.780 --> 36:20.135
I heard you tunnelling chaps
were wombats.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.051
Come up for some air, have you?

36:24.780 --> 36:26.930
Apparently you blokes keep missing.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.011
(both laugh)

36:39.980 --> 36:41.971
(machine gun fires)

36:43.180 --> 36:44.852
Set the exploder up over there.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.889
Right. That's us.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.732
They'll start up again at dawn.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.178
Christ.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.211
If a flare goes up, freeze.

37:20.300 --> 37:23.736
Keep one eye closed
until the flare drops -

37:23.820 --> 37:25.492
then you'll see better
when it's dark again.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.332
Thank you.

37:32.540 --> 37:34.815
- Did your boys cut the wire?
- Yeah.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.457
He ain't back yet. I'll cover you.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.979
Let's go.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.376
(fires gun)

38:13.420 --> 38:15.411
(flare hisses)

38:33.060 --> 38:34.573
- (gun fires)
- Man: Fuck!

38:45.100 --> 38:46.453
Fraser: It's boris, alright.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.409
Woodward: Right. Let's go.

39:06.660 --> 39:09.254
(flare hisses)

39:13.380 --> 39:15.336
(gun fires)

39:16.340 --> 39:18.296
Ready?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.251
(soldiers speak german)

39:43.260 --> 39:45.057
We'll have to go under.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.018
There must be a cellar.

39:53.460 --> 39:55.655
(gun fires)

40:13.180 --> 40:17.014
(soldiers speak german)

40:50.500 --> 40:52.934
(gun fires)

41:15.420 --> 41:16.933
(gun fires)

41:21.540 --> 41:23.019
(soldiers speak german)

42:19.900 --> 42:21.413
Corp!

42:25.980 --> 42:28.050
Fraser: Oh, jesus christ.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.700
- Woodward: What?
- We're short.

42:37.580 --> 42:39.252
Sir, we could try again tonight.

42:42.620 --> 42:44.372
Pull through: I think so.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.849
Stay on your bloody stomach

42:50.180 --> 42:52.410
the tommies see any movement.

42:53.580 --> 42:55.218
(gun fires)

42:55.300 --> 42:56.813
Oh!

43:01.980 --> 43:05.893
(both pant)

43:07.860 --> 43:09.976
(flare hisses)

43:16.020 --> 43:17.851
Who's the fastest man in our company?

43:17.940 --> 43:19.737
You need a runner?

43:19.820 --> 43:21.492
Yes.

43:21.580 --> 43:24.697
Yeah, streaky's bloody quick.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.418
(man grunts)

43:29.940 --> 43:31.419
Christ.

43:36.100 --> 43:37.772
Fraser: Is it one of our boys?

43:40.860 --> 43:42.691
Poor bastard.

43:44.820 --> 43:46.173
Stay here.

43:46.260 --> 43:48.376
Morris will be back any minute now.

43:48.460 --> 43:49.813
Fraser: Wait.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.856
Wait, sir!

43:55.540 --> 43:57.053
Who are you?

44:07.100 --> 44:08.658
- Clayton?
- (grunts)

44:10.300 --> 44:12.734
- Where did they get you?
- (grunts)

44:12.820 --> 44:16.017
- Mary, mary.
- (machine gun fires)

44:21.780 --> 44:24.533
- (grunts)
- Ok? Everything's ok.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.770
Come on. Come on, captain.

44:27.780 --> 44:29.008
Come on.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.169
Woodward: Help.

44:35.380 --> 44:37.530
(grunts)

44:42.140 --> 44:43.653
(machine gun fires)

44:48.500 --> 44:49.899
Field dressing.

44:58.540 --> 44:59.973
(yells)

45:14.100 --> 45:15.897
(machine gun fires)

45:17.100 --> 45:18.613
Christ.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.009
No! Wait.

45:35.420 --> 45:39.095
- Bastard's got a pattern.
- Thanks, mate.

45:44.460 --> 45:45.939
Captain.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.131
Just pray they haven't broken.

46:25.540 --> 46:27.451
(laughs)

46:31.260 --> 46:33.057
(grunts) thank you.

46:36.940 --> 46:39.738
Sir, are you wounded?

46:41.420 --> 46:43.297
I don't think so.

47:33.980 --> 47:36.813
- Hello, mr woodward.
- Marjorie.

47:38.180 --> 47:39.693
How is everything at home?

47:40.980 --> 47:42.493
We're coping.

47:56.980 --> 47:59.210
They've formed a mining battalion.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.734
It's a secret, i think.

48:01.820 --> 48:04.857
They're looking for miners
and engineers.

48:04.940 --> 48:06.373
I've joined up.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.451
In a few weeks,
i'll be leaving for training,

48:15.900 --> 48:17.777
i see.

48:25.460 --> 48:29.453
Marjorie, i'm nearly 10 years
your senior.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.576
You're only 16.

48:31.660 --> 48:33.332
I'll be 17 in a month.

48:35.540 --> 48:38.179
I signed the papers this morning.

48:57.380 --> 48:59.769
I would be happy
if you wrote to me...

49:05.660 --> 49:07.696
then you must first ask my father.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.894
Thank you for taking
the trouble to see me.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.013
Come in close.

49:47.140 --> 49:48.539
Fraser: Our left flank.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.008
Man: Let's go!

50:06.940 --> 50:09.500
Boom, boom, out right!

50:09.580 --> 50:11.172
Go, go, go, go!

50:11.260 --> 50:13.057
- Man: One man down.
- Man 2: Get up.

50:13.140 --> 50:14.539
- (whistle blows)
- Man: Ok, mark.

50:14.620 --> 50:15.939
Come on. Turn it up. Get back.

50:18.460 --> 50:21.736
(men yell indistinctly)

50:26.700 --> 50:28.736
Man: Pass it! Pass it! Get out of
here!

50:29.740 --> 50:36.380
- Get onside!
- Get in there! Come on! Tackle!

50:36.380 --> 50:37.859
(blows whistle)

50:38.940 --> 50:39.929
Man: Scrum.

50:44.460 --> 50:46.291
Man 2: Pack it in, boys. Come in
hard.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.172
Man: It's out! It's out!

50:50.260 --> 50:52.979
- Man 2: Push! Push out!
- Men: Run!

50:55.100 --> 50:56.692
- Come on, billy!
- Man: Go, billy!

50:56.780 --> 50:58.816
- (men yell)
- Man: I'm with you, billy.

50:59.980 --> 51:03.655
- Billy, go!
- Go, streaky!

51:04.860 --> 51:06.976
(men cheer)

51:15.740 --> 51:18.095
Six points to three.

51:18.180 --> 51:19.659

51:24.820 --> 51:26.697

51:55.980 --> 51:57.857
Well done, sir.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.658
Thank you, sergeant fraser.

51:59.740 --> 52:01.970
- (men laugh)
- Man: Hey, sarge!

52:02.060 --> 52:03.334
As you were!

52:17.060 --> 52:18.937
We're moving up the line.

52:19.020 --> 52:20.772
We load up at midnight.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.339
Get to move up the line. (laughs)

52:28.420 --> 52:29.899
Where we heading, sir?

52:29.980 --> 52:32.448
Belgium.

52:32.540 --> 52:33.939
Hill 60.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.299
Better get your gear.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.690
Righto, you blokes. Let's go.

52:53.940 --> 52:58.855
I nearly forgot - a present from
fritz.

52:58.940 --> 53:00.771
He said to say,
‘‘thanks for all your help."

53:00.860 --> 53:03.090
Cheers, mate.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.057
English soldier: You'll be right,
lads.

53:09.140 --> 53:10.698
Australian soldier: Thanks, mate.

53:19.300 --> 53:20.779
(distant explosion)

53:27.100 --> 53:29.853
(baby cries)

53:31.860 --> 53:33.771
(explosions)

53:42.580 --> 53:44.218
Too early for the grey hen, sir?

53:48.380 --> 53:49.733
Never too early.

54:03.860 --> 54:06.579
(shivers)

54:09.780 --> 54:11.532
- I'm right.
- Take 'em.

54:11.620 --> 54:13.338
You're just skin and bones.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.331
Come on, son.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.372
(explosion)

54:24.740 --> 54:26.059
Decent fit.

54:26.140 --> 54:28.131
My elsa's a first-rate knitter.

54:30.780 --> 54:31.769
(laughs)

54:34.180 --> 54:35.454
(laughter)

54:43.020 --> 54:45.898
Don't i know it? And he's still
growing.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.093
You join up together?

55:02.500 --> 55:04.058
And he's quit the pits and joined up.

55:08.180 --> 55:09.533
Yep. (chuckles)

55:09.620 --> 55:11.451
Well, you can't unjoin.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.373
So, after walt went to bed,
i said to elsa,

55:21.220 --> 55:23.688
elsa didn't know what was worse -

55:42.220 --> 55:44.176
(shell explodes)

55:49.900 --> 55:52.334
Stay low! Stay low!

55:52.420 --> 55:55.935
(shells explode, men shout)

56:01.980 --> 56:03.971
Stay here!

56:17.500 --> 56:19.013
He said that way!

56:20.780 --> 56:22.213
Or south to hill 60?

56:22.300 --> 56:25.098
Fraser! This way!

56:25.180 --> 56:26.533
(artillery shell whines)

56:26.620 --> 56:27.973
(shell explodes)

56:28.060 --> 56:29.493
Fraser: Let's go!

56:32.820 --> 56:34.014
Keep down!

56:46.340 --> 56:48.251
Come on, boys!

56:48.340 --> 56:49.853
(artillery shell whistles)

56:50.900 --> 56:52.094
(man yells)

56:58.180 --> 56:59.579
Get up! Go!

57:04.220 --> 57:06.495
(artillery shells whistle)

57:06.580 --> 57:07.979
Where are the others?

57:17.740 --> 57:20.049
(coughing)

57:20.140 --> 57:21.971
Fraser: Sir!

57:23.780 --> 57:25.099
We left the bloody kids behind.

57:25.180 --> 57:26.169
Who's missing?

57:26.260 --> 57:28.137
Young sneddon, tiffin and bacon.

57:28.220 --> 57:29.255
Walter!

57:29.340 --> 57:31.695
(screams) walt!

57:34.580 --> 57:37.458
(distant artillery fire)

57:40.260 --> 57:43.297
(distant explosions)

57:46.540 --> 57:48.610
- (machine-gun fire)
- Arggh!

57:49.780 --> 57:51.293
(machine-gun fire)

57:51.380 --> 57:53.132
(men yell)

57:54.900 --> 57:55.935
(grunts)

57:56.020 --> 57:58.659
(walt grunts and sobs)

58:02.300 --> 58:03.528
(machine gun fires)

58:03.620 --> 58:05.053
(walt screams, sobs)

58:07.540 --> 58:08.893
He's got the high ground.

58:08.980 --> 58:10.095
(walt weeps)

58:10.180 --> 58:12.933
(flare hisses)

58:13.020 --> 58:14.738
Jim: (yells) walter!

58:14.820 --> 58:16.253
Over here!

58:17.260 --> 58:18.579
Oh, fuck!

58:18.660 --> 58:19.979
We've missed it.

58:20.060 --> 58:21.049
(walt sobs)

58:21.140 --> 58:23.529
Sap's over to the right. About 25
yards.

58:28.860 --> 58:29.929
You ready?

58:30.020 --> 58:31.658
(machine-gun fire)

58:31.740 --> 58:32.968
(screams and cries)

58:33.060 --> 58:34.778
Walt, we can't stay here, mate.

58:34.860 --> 58:37.579
(weeps continuously)

58:43.500 --> 58:44.819
Tell you what,

58:44.900 --> 58:46.572
i'll go to the left and draw crabs.

58:52.980 --> 58:53.969
(whispers) no.

58:55.180 --> 58:56.659
I'm twice as fast as you blokes.

58:58.060 --> 59:00.574
Probably make it before youse do.

59:02.300 --> 59:03.733
Come on, walt!

59:05.700 --> 59:08.578
(repeated machine-gun fire)

59:14.020 --> 59:15.339
(machine-gun fire)

59:15.420 --> 59:17.251
- Stay low!
- Tiffin!

59:17.340 --> 59:18.932
Walt!

59:19.020 --> 59:20.339
Over here, mate!

59:20.420 --> 59:21.853
Come on.

59:23.020 --> 59:25.329
Tiffin: Streaky's still out there!

59:27.100 --> 59:28.249
Billy!

59:28.340 --> 59:30.171
Billy bacon!

59:32.780 --> 59:34.179
Streaky!

59:40.380 --> 59:41.779
They're home!

59:44.380 --> 59:47.053
- Streaky!
- Streaky!

59:47.140 --> 59:48.493
- Run!
- (machine-gun fire)

59:48.580 --> 59:50.775
- Billy!
- Go on, billy!

59:50.860 --> 59:52.851
- Billy!
- Come on, billy!

59:54.780 --> 59:56.850
- Run, billy!
- Come on!

59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.339
Arggh!

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.258
(moans)

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.810
Stretcher!

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.811
Stretcher bearers!

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.169
Streaky?

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.298
Oh, this is god's
flamin' handiwork, is it?

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.492
Grab his disc and pay book.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.332
We'll bury him in the morning.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.933
Come on, frank.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.577
(man yells in distance)

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.537
Captain woodward.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.372
1st australian tunnellers.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.731
- Mcbride!
- Captain mcbride, actually.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.209
Where you been?
Been waiting for hours.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.457
(gunfire)

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.613
Hell of a place, eh?

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.813
Your men can bunk down in there.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.457
Couple of hours?

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.098
Gee, sir. They'll turn soft on you.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.738
Come on!

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.819
Have you seen the tunnels?

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.893
You've got a big surprise
in store for you.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.773
Come on.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.373
Officers' dugout's down this way.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.690
Tiffin: Wetter in here
than it is out there.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.658
Walt: More rats than in frickin'
france.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.332
Fraser: At least they're belgian
rats.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.336
Change is as good as a holiday.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.577
At least we're back underground.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.418
(explosion)

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.730
And we'll be staying underground.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.488
One way or another.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.174
What's that supposed to mean?

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.332
This is how it goes from now on.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.217
We'll be dodging shells and shrapnel

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.219
like poor old streaky.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.660
And it's no game of skill
down here, neither.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.693
Or buried alive
for our fucking troubles.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.856
Well, that cheered us all up.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.612
(knocks on door)

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.452
Mr waddell.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.891
Oliver.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.218
When do you set off?

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.291
About three weeks.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.248
Right, well... you'd better come in,
then.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.693
Actually...

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.259
...i'd like to ask you something.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.333
And...

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.298
- i know.
- Damn it.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.415
(sighs) oh.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.218
- Emma.
- What?

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.097
Your walk?

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.259
Aye.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.773
If you'd care to come?

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.416
Oh... of course.

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.538
When i get back...

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.612
...i'll take you walking every day.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.859
(speaks german)

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.095
Ja.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.617
Soldier: Can't see it.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.932
(fires gun)

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.248
Keep going.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.739
Mate, can i have a bo-peep?

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.299
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thanks.

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:18.970
Hey, pull through.
Hill 60- take a look.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.538
(gunshot)

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.339
Is that it?

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:30.809
(gunshot)

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:35.538
(both laugh)

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.979
(fires gun)

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.459
(fires machine gun)

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.496
(water sloshes)

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.216
Woodward: So, why ‘berlin sap'?

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.658
They reckon it almost reaches berlin.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:00.453
This whole area is below sea level.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.973
Was?

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.732
Mcbride: Now it's ours.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.978
(whispers) we're 90 feet down now.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.970
Right below german lines.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.890
Hill 60 is directly above us.

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:27.734
Eh, eh, eh? Shh-shh. Shh.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:31.970
The blue clay of flanders.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.859
Beautiful.

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:41.932
Major north, 3rd canadian tunnellers.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.850
Fritz has set up in the swim sand.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.010
He can't get at us. Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.138
If you will.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.060
53,000 pounds of
ammonal high explosive.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.210
8,000 pounds of guncotton.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.893
No, nobody has. Nobody.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.930
500 feet down there
is a caterpillar mine.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:16.171
That one's 70,000 pounds.

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.739
There's 21 of them.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.699
Nearly a million pounds of ammonal.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.453
North: Mm-hm?

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.531
You know, when this thing blows,

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.569
woodward: Mm-hm.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.818
And keep it secret from fritz.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.688
No, no, no. No. Fritz has got no
idea.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.137
He thinks we're digging wells.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.097
(laughs hoarsely)

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.136
Well, this'll finish the war.

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.530
End it altogether.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.099
Think of that, huh?

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.211
When do they plan to detonate?

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.972
(breathes deeply)

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.213
They're pulling me out.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.216
It's up to you now.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.453
It's all up to you.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.893
Poor bugger.

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.535
Yeah, he sleeps down here.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.211
So, when are they gonna blow them?

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.528
No-one knows.

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.054
Well, i'm a miner not a general...

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.977
...but i reckon it's simple
arithmetic.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.100
But if they think
there's an attack coming,

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.053
and kill thousands.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.700
Time it right,

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.293
tens of thousands.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.574
(scrapes loudly)

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.854
(banging echoes)

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.051
Nein.

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.339
Ja.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.936
Jim, check every prop and every stay,

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.090
- take walter and ginger.
- Jim: Sir.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.977
- I'll do the same for caterpillar.
- Righto.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.738
- Take percy.
- Righto.

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.335
Fraser, you check the water line.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.570
I want to know the depth
from the surface.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.334
- Take tiffin with you.
- Sir.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.934
Fraser: Come on, tiffin.

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.853
(gunshot)

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.454
(machine-gun fire)

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.132
- Man: To the left.
- Man 2: Yeah.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.858
(gunshot)

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:17.419
Man 3: Come out!

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.292
(indistinct shouting)

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.733
(gunshot)

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.854
(machine-gun fire)

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.095
(gunshot)

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.174
(distant shouting)

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.012
(gunshot)

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.415
(man shouts order in german)

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.259
(inhales deeply)

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.211
(muffled gunfire)

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.733
(muffled machine-gun fire)

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.533
(gunshots continue)

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.255
Bit bloody close.

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:55.092
Sniper shell, by the size of it.

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.772
Would have made a mess
of your melon.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.979
Only his smile left.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.379
(laughs)

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.611
(gunshots continue)

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.492
How old are you?

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.813
16.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.460
Keep me away from the horrors of war.

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.973
(laughs)

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.858
(both laugh)

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.088
Over here.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.219
Man: Stretcher bearer!

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:44.128
- (fires gun)
- Alright, come on. Let's go.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.174
Water seeps down,
pools above the clay.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.017
Just to keep the water level down.

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.931
If we lose even a few of those men,

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.692
bloody mines'll be useless.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.493
(water trickles steadily)

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.056
That's oak.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.218
Me dad's a carpenter.

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.932
Get out of them bloody pits.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.658
Church?

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.618
Cathedral. Ypres cathedral.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.779
Probably.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.579
And get the water out that way?

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.810
The whole middle section is unstable.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:04.654
Shaft walls collapse
after about six feet.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.370
We propose sinking a shaft

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.178
rutledge?

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.973
This is over 90 feet deep.

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.413
Woodward: The new ones will, sir.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.019
This is not a new idea, sir.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.411
Have you been down there, colonel?

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:58.378
Alright. That will be all.

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.335
- How.
- We don't dig from the surface, sir.

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.619
And hide the blue clay.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.656
Captain woodward, 20 feet down

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.009
you are wrong, colonel!

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.140
We'll use steel sections
to control the water

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.573
and stop the walls collapsing.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.820
We use jacks from the roof
of the gallery

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.538
to force the steel sections
downwards.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.890
- Rough estimate?
- General: How long?

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:54.858
Three weeks, give or take.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.499
Man: Go, go, go!

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.969
(soldiers shout and scream)

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:19.892
Man: Go! Keep going.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.095
Aarggh!

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.257
(explosions and shouting)

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.774
- (explosion)
- Aarggh!

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.652
One more.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.455
Yep.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.972
(clanging and clattering)

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.096
Shh. Shh.

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:44.493
We're nearly there.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.014
Bucket it out. Get those jacks back
up.

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.932
Drive it further into the clay.

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:19.052
(machine rattles)

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.778
It's going, sir.

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.858
(gunshot)

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.935
General: Not exactly gushing.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.051
What's happening, tiffin?

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.857
It seems to be working.

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.615
(gunshot)

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.338
Colonel: Ridiculous.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.410
Must be too much pressure.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.253
I'm sure we...

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.296
full report by the morning.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.655
(sighs)

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.813
(water gurgles)

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.216
- (all laugh)
- Man: Yes!

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.699
(clears throat)

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.819
(machine chugs quietly)

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.568
And two diversion tunnels.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.580
- What diversion tunnels?
- I'll show you, sir.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:58.695
There's no need.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.930
- It's no trouble.
- There is no need.

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.014
I think fritz is coming at us again.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.658
Woodward: That means it's working.

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:18.096
He's been quiet for four minutes.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:20.057
I reckon he could be ready to blow.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.971
Let them.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.812
Is it just the two of you down there?

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.219
- Just me, sir.
- Where's walt?

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.973
He's up getting me a billy of tea.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.698
What? He abandoned his post?

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.374
- No, he just...
- put it on the report.

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:33.859
Why aren't you at your post?

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.578
Sir, the listeners have permission...

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.218
i know the orders, captain!

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.529
Get back down there.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.136
Sir...

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.854
jim.

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:15.849
Woodward: Jim!

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.488
Dad!

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.216
Walt: Dad!

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:29.058
Walt: Dad!

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.368
Woodward: Jim!

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.779
- (breathes heavily)
- Dad!

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.293
(breathes heavily)

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:44.137
Walt: Daddy, can you hear me? Dad!

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:49.054
(walt cries loudly)

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.017
All: Amen.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.413
(poignant violin music)

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:57.251
Sir?

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.538
I've been wanting to give you this...

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.488
...for that girl of yours, sir.

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.730
I made it from that wood you liked...

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.893
...from the cathedral.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.619
It's beautiful.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.694
By a nice young chap named frank
tiffin.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.136
And thank him for his handiwork.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.018
(speaks german)

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:38.415
- What is it?
- Not sure.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:51.340
15 degrees, about 20ft forward,
15ft down.

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.853
Nothing.

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.899
(coughs loudly)

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:13.449
An attack tunnel?

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:17.533
No, it's different.

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.296
No. Can't be.

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.413
(coughs lightly)

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.610
(coughs)

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:47.531
- (coughs)
- (gunfire)

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.132
(coughs)

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:04.017
Man: Come on!

01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.573
(gunshot)

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.333
Man: Come on!

01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:29.657
(man yells indistinctly)

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.733
(speaks german)

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.170
Du, nach oben.

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.172
Woodward? Woodward?

01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.579
Woodward!

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.572
Captain woodward, get up!

01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.659
Colonel: That's in 36 hours.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.773
Sir.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.452
There'll be 21 blasts in all.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.850
Yours will be the final two
in the sequence.

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.896
It's critical to the entire operation

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.374
yes, sir.

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.659
Firing orders.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.095
Man: Attention.

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:09.734
All quiet, sir,
apart from a few squeaks.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.653
- Rats?
- Probably.

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.173
Why do you say that?

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.694
Where?

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.852
Lower listening post, berlin sap.

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.813
Windlass.

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.654
(squeaking)

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.173
It's a shaft.

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.496
Right here.

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.051
That's right on top of the mine
at hill 60.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.932
- I've calculated the depth...
- yes.

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.738
63 feet, sir.

01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:05.936
We blow in 10 hours.

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:18.016
I hold you personally responsible.

01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.611
Do what you have to do, woodward.

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.652
- That's just above the mine.
- Yes.

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.059
That's suicidal.

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.131
That's an order, sergeant.

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.054
Let's go.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.971
Come on, let's go!

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.936
(speaks german)

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:50.896
They're 10 feet forward, 15 feet up.

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:53.050
Morris.

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.019
Check it again.

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.179
Mm-hm.

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.218
(continuous artillery fire)

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.779
29 minutes.

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.619
I'm going back down.

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:28.733
Clear, please.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.139
Man: Out of the way!

01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:33.098
(continuous artillery fire)

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:49.619
Man: Some tea coming.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:56.610
(artillery shell whistles)

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:57.928
(shell explodes)

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.488
(speaks german)

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.979
(whispers) on three.

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.652
One...

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:30.775
...two...

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.849
...three.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.975
(all inhale)

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.698
(silence)

01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:38.136
(faint scratching)

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.457
(whispers)
They're almost on top of us.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:45.939
I've gotta set the charge.

01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.376
No. That'll set off the main mine.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.416
Wait till they're a few feet away.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.013
Then use the camouflet.

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.579
A few feet?

01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:59.731
Another four feet forward.

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.572
There's no time.

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.529
Four feet forward, fraser.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.850
Then set the charge.

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:15.333
(speaks german)

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.056
(whispers) set the charge.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.099
Finish the backing, boys.

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.699
(explosion)

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.010
They did it.

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.011
I'm coming home. (laughs)

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:30.089
Voomp!

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.648
(whistles)

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.129
- Splat!
- (all laugh)

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.938
Go easy, boys.

01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.612
Load up. Let's get out of here.

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.338
(laughs)

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.615
Nein, nein! Schnell! Schnell!

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.539
(laughter)

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.578
(distant explosions continue)

01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.491
- All clear below.
- Yes, sir.

01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:00.411
The german shaft has been crumped.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.411
All circuits are complete.

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.180
Five minutes!

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.296
Man: (yells) five minutes!

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:24.977
Five minutes!

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.130
(mutters quietly)

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.814
(men murmur quietly)

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.178
This is our great occasion.

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.011
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.017
Good luck.

01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.810
(heavy breathing)

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.253
Four minutes to go.

01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.659
- Did it easy.
- Yeah.

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.173
(rumbling)

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.056
Man buried!

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.417
- Who is it?
- It's tiffin! He's back there!

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:22.819
Fuck.

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:24.333
Go! Go!

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.933
Tiffin!

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.214
Tiffin!

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:35.653
Tiffin: Sarge?

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.452
I'll get them to hold the mine.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.893
Well, what do we do?

01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.253
Tiffin!

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.216
Tiffin: (muffled) just go.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.177
No point in all of us dying.

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:22.971
Fraser will get them to stop!

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:25.938
We'll come back when we know!

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.579
Righto!

01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:36.099
'Bye, tiffin!

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.458
Come on, walt! Come on!

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.053
Cheerio, lads.

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.411
One minute!

01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:55.733
Out of the way, please! Move!

01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.014
(shouts) fuckin' move!

01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.250
Fix bayonets!

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:01.171
Fraser: Out of the way! Move!

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.296
Out of the way! Make way!

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.733
Out of the fuckin' way!

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.970
(shouts orders)

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.812
20 seconds!

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:20.090
Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:23.729
- Out of the fuckin' way!
- 15 seconds!

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.733
Tiffin's still in there.

01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.697
- What happened?
- Collapse.

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.649
Sir, please.

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.379
10 seconds!

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.893
- He's still alive.
- Nine!

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:39.969
Eight!

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.652
We'd have him out in a few minutes.

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:42.968
Seven!

01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.493
Six!

01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.411
Five!

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.297
Four!

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.098
Three!

01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.693
- Fraser: Woodward!
- Two!

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:54.692
(shouts) for christ's sake! It's
tiffin!

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.213
Fire!

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.418
(explosion)

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.618
(cicadas buzz, birds chirp)

01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:41.771
(melancholy music)

01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.613
Feel it?

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.338
(distant explosion)

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.570
You're hearing your own heartbeat.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:18.538
(rumbling intensifies)

01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:26.058
(loud rumbling)

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:33.533
(sniffs)

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.054
(knock on door)

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.973
Mcbride: Woodward.
People are waiting.

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.375
Woody, are you alright?

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.851
- (doorknob turns)
- I'm fine.

01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.012
I'll be out shortly.

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:22.099
You right?

01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:27.652
(gentle piano music)

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:41.052
(piano music continues)

01:49:42.305 --> 01:49:48.545
