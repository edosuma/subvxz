00:13.396 --> 00:14.479
- Call Logan.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.583
Call Logan.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.013
- Oh Chi.

00:23.180 --> 00:26.250
You are so good at this.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.540
Wow, your feet.

00:28.540 --> 00:32.350
They are so smooth.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.940
Oh, Samantha.

00:33.940 --> 00:35.070
Hey, Sammy.

00:35.070 --> 00:37.910
- Logan, please listen carefully.

00:39.779 --> 00:41.326
I've been taken.

00:41.326 --> 00:42.861
- What the heck?

00:45.455 --> 00:46.862
Listen to me, Samantha.

00:46.862 --> 00:49.750
Okay, I need to know
everything that's happened.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.319
Okay, was it a man or a woman?

00:51.319 --> 00:52.460
- Man.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.449
- Has he got a hat?

00:53.449 --> 00:54.620
- No.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.820
- Has he got a mustache?

00:56.994 --> 00:57.827
- No.

00:57.827 --> 00:59.310
- Has he got glasses?

00:59.310 --> 01:00.670
Is it Herman?

01:00.670 --> 01:01.919
Is it Alfred?

01:01.919 --> 01:03.359
Is it Max!

01:03.359 --> 01:04.493
Samantha!

01:04.493 --> 01:05.326
Is it Max?

01:08.641 --> 01:09.891
- Stop banging.

01:12.780 --> 01:13.697
- Samantha!

01:15.287 --> 01:17.980
Baby, it's me, Logan.

01:17.980 --> 01:19.270
Pass the phone to the kidnapper.

01:19.270 --> 01:21.115
This message is for him.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.070
No, I'm just laughing to myself about

01:25.070 --> 01:26.555
what a big wooly brain you are.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.500
You kicked over a hornet's nest.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.810
No, no, no, no I take that back.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.087
You've just put your
dick in a hornet's nest.

01:33.087 --> 01:34.380
Yeah, you know what?

01:34.380 --> 01:36.150
Kill her, kill her if you want to.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.310
I don't care.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.060
Ah, please don't kill her.

01:39.060 --> 01:39.893
Do not kill her.

01:39.893 --> 01:41.690
And Samantha, if you heard that message

01:41.690 --> 01:43.290
seriously I did not mean it.

01:43.290 --> 01:44.490
Just forget you heard it.

01:44.490 --> 01:45.323
I don't want you to die,

01:45.323 --> 01:47.816
and I love you.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.733
Oh gee whiz,

01:51.320 --> 01:56.320
I just realized I said I loved
you in that last message.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.540
Who's this guy rushing things, right?

02:00.833 --> 02:02.430
Um, what I meant was

02:03.500 --> 02:05.980
I more than like you.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.498
I look you.

02:07.498 --> 02:08.331
Is that a thing?

02:10.121 --> 02:11.625
I mean that could be our thing, right?

02:11.625 --> 02:13.410
Okay, getting back to this

02:13.410 --> 02:14.890
whole kidnapping thing.

02:14.890 --> 02:17.670
I'm livid, seething and furious!

02:17.670 --> 02:20.370
And Samantha, if you can hear this

02:20.370 --> 02:22.293
baby, I'm gonna get you back.

02:29.411 --> 02:31.273
Someone has taken Samantha.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.030
- And who's Samantha?

02:34.030 --> 02:35.540
- Who's Samantha?

02:35.540 --> 02:37.510
My girlfriend.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.080
Remember?

02:39.080 --> 02:42.210
Requesting immediate
permission to go and rescue

02:42.210 --> 02:43.460
of my team.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.540
- Wait, Mann, how long have
you been seeing this woman?

02:45.540 --> 02:46.780
- I've not said a bit of thing on it,

02:46.780 --> 02:49.890
13, 14 days including the
days I haven't seen her

02:49.890 --> 02:52.593
of which there's been 10, maybe 11.

02:52.593 --> 02:54.100
Listen to me, Ruth.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.122
I really like this girl.

02:56.122 --> 02:57.522
In fact, I think I look her.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.257
- You look her?

03:00.257 --> 03:01.960
- You're gonna think it's silly.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.850
It's this language that
we've been developing

03:04.850 --> 03:08.585
to tell each other how we
feel about one another.

03:08.585 --> 03:10.310
- Logan, have you had sex?

03:10.310 --> 03:11.500
- Yeah, yeah loads of times.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.333
I've done all the positions.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.896
- No, with Samantha.

03:13.896 --> 03:15.970
- Come on, that's a,

03:15.970 --> 03:17.300
that's a disgusting question.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.750
- It's fine, I'll just put it as a no.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.930
- Yeah look, don't put it as a no.

03:19.930 --> 03:21.401
Just put it as maybe.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.103
And hey, not applicable.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.985
Logan refused to answer.
- Right.

03:24.985 --> 03:27.050
- I need your help.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.430
Please help me.

03:28.430 --> 03:29.263
- No.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.910
Hello, hello?

03:33.910 --> 03:36.420
Excuse me, you have the whole canteen

03:36.420 --> 03:38.670
and you choose to sit
right there next to me?

03:39.660 --> 03:41.483
Can you move, please?

03:42.990 --> 03:43.913
My word.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.200
Now, Mann, I'm sorry.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.468
This is defintely a matter for the police.

03:48.468 --> 03:50.477
- Come on, this thing stinks of Abacus.

03:50.477 --> 03:53.260
- No, this stinks of you
wasting my agency's resources

03:53.260 --> 03:54.540
on a non-operative.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.848
Okay, who's clearly not that into you.

03:56.848 --> 03:57.681
- You know what?

03:57.681 --> 03:59.310
Keep your damn resources.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.830
I should remind you

04:00.830 --> 04:02.800
I still have the Antelope's Tail.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.720
- Mann, that is not a toy.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.930
You go anywhere in the
world with that device

04:06.930 --> 04:08.480
and you will become enemy of the state.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.410
Do you hear me?

04:09.410 --> 04:12.900
- God, you just don't
know what love is, do you?

04:12.900 --> 04:15.490
What the hell did Frank do to you?

04:15.490 --> 04:17.540
- Huh, who's Frank?

04:17.540 --> 04:18.380
- I don't know.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.213
I just said it.

04:19.213 --> 04:20.690
It sounded like something I'd say

04:20.690 --> 04:23.281
just before I walked away.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.564
You got a location on Samantha for me?

04:30.564 --> 04:31.660
- Affirmative.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.650
Hacked into her former phone.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.480
I could track him from the office.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.123
She's in Kotor, Montenegro.

04:38.380 --> 04:39.440
- I'm gonna need two passports.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.269
One for me, one for Graham.

04:41.269 --> 04:44.400
You should know, Ruth is
not backing this thing.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.970
Action Team going rogue.

04:46.970 --> 04:49.363
- Fuck me, that makes my fanny rocket.

04:49.363 --> 04:51.030
- Not a word.

04:51.030 --> 04:51.863
I don't have to tell you this,

04:51.863 --> 04:53.820
but this mission is top secret.

04:53.820 --> 04:54.763
You know what that means.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.370
- Secret's safe with me.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.840
- I bet there's some keys up there, huh?

05:05.840 --> 05:07.190
- Always room for one more.

05:09.210 --> 05:10.043
I'm fucked.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.520
- I got another two miles left in me.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.810
- Cool chef, arms straight, knees up.

05:13.810 --> 05:14.990
- Oh!
- What?

05:14.990 --> 05:15.833
Bomber plane.

05:19.370 --> 05:20.270
- I have the girl.

05:21.276 --> 05:22.622
- How long will you be?

05:22.622 --> 05:23.790
- We will stay here tonight

05:23.790 --> 05:26.610
and begin the journey to
headquarters at sunrise.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.443
- Bogohardt did drive me here.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.020
What is taking you so long?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.203
Is it because you can only turn left?

05:35.800 --> 05:36.670
- Huh?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.540
- 'Cause you only have one eye?

05:38.540 --> 05:40.730
- Oh come on, seriously?

05:40.730 --> 05:42.650
I just had operation, man.

05:42.650 --> 05:44.340
This is really hurting my feelings.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.340
- No, you are a valued
member of this organization.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.550
- Yes, exactly so.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.210
And I must say I'm very happy

05:52.210 --> 05:56.300
you are keeping an eye on things.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.190
- Listen, I don't even know why I bothered

05:58.190 --> 05:59.910
coming back to this bullshit.

05:59.910 --> 06:02.830
Okay listen, if anything I am more strong

06:02.830 --> 06:04.180
and more focused than ever.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.063
Fucking stuntman.

06:15.733 --> 06:16.566
I'm sorry.

06:18.047 --> 06:19.853
I'm shouting and making you chomp.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.372
- Really struggling with
your eye, aren't you?

06:26.372 --> 06:27.622
- No, I'm fine.

06:29.498 --> 06:30.715
- Do you want to talk about it?

06:30.715 --> 06:31.548
- No!

06:47.650 --> 06:49.778
I was number one assistant

06:49.778 --> 06:51.483
in the whole Abacus organization.

06:51.483 --> 06:53.780
And then I get shot in my shitting eye

06:53.780 --> 06:55.964
by shitting Action Team.

06:55.964 --> 06:58.633
And now I'm doing
kidnapping of some women?

06:58.633 --> 07:00.283
I don't even know if I'm doing that right.

07:00.283 --> 07:02.313
- Well I think you're doing really well.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.163
I felt really threatened.

07:06.590 --> 07:10.143
And thanks for the water and the bucket.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.790
You didn't have to do that.

07:21.725 --> 07:25.660
- Well, there's no point
in me being asshole.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.808
We may be together for many days.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.383
- I'm sorry about last night.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.630
I just want first time to be special.

07:55.630 --> 07:57.250
You know?

07:57.250 --> 07:58.920
Don't want you thinking I'm frigid.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.323
- Frigid, no!

08:01.662 --> 08:03.560
No, I'm fine with just kissing.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.492
This is some of the best
kissing I've ever had.

08:06.492 --> 08:08.450
If anything this trip
will be a welcome break

08:08.450 --> 08:10.690
from all this kissing we've been doing.

08:10.690 --> 08:11.740
- Graham, I'm scared.

08:13.214 --> 08:15.370
About Ruth finding out about all this

08:15.370 --> 08:16.410
going rogue business.

08:16.410 --> 08:18.980
- Hey, hey, hey, look at me.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.610
Look at me.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.893
Do not be scared.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.303
I am a rogue.

08:25.870 --> 08:26.703
I'm a rogue.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.890
And if there's a lady in danger

08:29.890 --> 08:31.490
that rouge cannot be controlled.

08:32.749 --> 08:36.160
- Well, stay safe Graham Reaper.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.750
And text me when you land.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.623
I want to know where you are at all times.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.140
- A kiss for my lady if thou doth oblige?

08:56.620 --> 08:57.453
Now that...

08:59.365 --> 09:00.943
That was the favorite kiss.

09:00.943 --> 09:02.400
- Yes, that was a good one.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.400
- It was, wasn't it?

09:21.393 --> 09:22.746
- Hey babe.

09:22.746 --> 09:25.320
Two first class tickets
to Kotor, Montenegro

09:25.320 --> 09:27.473
with access to the VIP lounge.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.570
Stick it on there.

09:32.090 --> 09:34.250
So, tell me G.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.600
You and Hibiscus, did you
go all the way last night?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.880
- Well a gentleman never
reveals his secrets.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.210
- Sorry, this card's been declined.

09:41.210 --> 09:42.250
- There must be some mistake.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.400
Please try again.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.900
- It's a work card, it's fine.

09:48.390 --> 09:51.764
- Sorry, there's no money on this card.

09:51.764 --> 09:52.597
- Dammit!

09:54.361 --> 09:55.730
You know what this is, don't you?

09:55.730 --> 09:59.150
Ruth has disabled the
Action Team credit card.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.443
Now what are we gonna do?

10:01.313 --> 10:03.790
- You gonna have to use
your own funds, bro.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.270
- Yeah, only that's...

10:06.260 --> 10:07.860
That's something I can
certainly think about.

10:07.860 --> 10:10.700
I mean, that's something I could,

10:10.700 --> 10:11.570
you know, process

10:11.570 --> 10:13.290
and and and think about.

10:13.290 --> 10:14.970
And what am I...

10:14.970 --> 10:16.470
No, I could defintely do that.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.570
I mean, top of your head.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.788
How much do you think it will cost?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.970
- Um, um...

10:24.921 --> 10:26.709
Starts at about 10 grand.

10:30.321 --> 10:32.940
10 thousand pounds for
a simple rescue mission?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.190
You know what,

10:34.190 --> 10:36.070
she's worth every penny.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.470
She is, and I would do it in a heartbeat.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.820
But I forgot my wallet.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.292
I forgot my wallet.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.177
- Sir?

10:43.177 --> 10:44.010
- I really wanna do it,

10:44.010 --> 10:44.843
but I haven't got my wallet with me.

10:44.843 --> 10:45.897
- Sir?
- Yes?

10:45.897 --> 10:47.503
- Sir, it's in your hand.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.339
- Thanks sweetheart,
it's really good of you.

10:54.339 --> 10:55.643
You've been a real help today.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.353
Is this crazy?

11:00.353 --> 11:01.186
Now tell me now.

11:01.186 --> 11:02.110
Be honest with me, bro.

11:02.110 --> 11:02.943
Am I being crazy?

11:02.943 --> 11:04.200
Am I being mad?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.380
- She's in grave danger.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.530
They're gonna kill her.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.460
- Two tickets to Kotor, economy.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.370
And no extra leg room.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.450
Don't worry about the meal.

11:14.450 --> 11:16.274
We'll get a couple of
sandwiches from boots.

11:16.274 --> 11:17.107
- Boots.

11:17.107 --> 11:17.940
- Boots?
- Yes Boots!

11:30.897 --> 11:32.010
- This is it.

11:32.010 --> 11:33.290
This is the road.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.350
Let's just keep it cool, stake it out

11:35.350 --> 11:37.130
and await instructions from Monica.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.960
- Yeah, we should also look
into parking charges, as well.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.350
You know what these Europeans are like.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.000
I'll see I need as any.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.430
Unexpected expenditure on this mission.

11:47.430 --> 11:49.350
- That said, I would have
spent a little bit more

11:49.350 --> 11:50.493
on the car, though.

11:51.330 --> 11:52.700
If I'm honest.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.870
You know, just in case we get caught

11:53.870 --> 11:55.970
in a car chase scenario.

11:55.970 --> 11:58.230
- You're kidding me, this car?

11:58.230 --> 11:59.870
This is a great car.

11:59.870 --> 12:01.310
This is an amazing car.

12:01.310 --> 12:02.513
Perfect for our needs.

12:03.380 --> 12:04.400
- And I would have,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.556
am I'm not just gonna flag this,

12:06.556 --> 12:09.350
I probably would have
got fully comp insurance.

12:09.350 --> 12:12.140
- Total con, total con!

12:12.140 --> 12:12.973
That's a total,

12:12.973 --> 12:14.340
you should know that!

12:14.340 --> 12:16.880
And you know who might
make premium package

12:16.880 --> 12:19.453
car insurance is driving this thing.

12:20.839 --> 12:21.703
- Very well.

12:23.430 --> 12:25.640
Compliments will get you everywhere.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.011
Do you mean that?

12:27.011 --> 12:28.048
- Yeah, I mean it.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.512
- Logan, Logan mate, do you read me?

12:30.512 --> 12:31.543
- Go ahead Mon.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.810
- Right boys, I've got
her exact coordinates.

12:33.810 --> 12:36.200
She's directly north of
your current location.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.520
Okay, so she'll be right
up in front of you.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.503
Looks a little bit like a T junction.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.163
On Pyakaodikina.

12:45.596 --> 12:47.264
- Got it.

12:47.264 --> 12:48.464
I'm looking right at it.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.322
- Yeah, I think they're stirred now.

12:52.322 --> 12:53.400
Don't you?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.470
- Do you need anything else?

12:54.470 --> 12:57.220
- No actually, I need to
concentrate to be honest so...

12:59.040 --> 13:00.293
I got a visual up.

13:01.135 --> 13:03.610
The yellow building, number 337.

13:03.610 --> 13:04.527
- I got it.

13:05.597 --> 13:06.502
- Keep moving.

13:06.502 --> 13:07.837
- Keep moving.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.620
- Observe for now.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.930
But if the situation changes

13:16.930 --> 13:18.710
your primary objective is to retrieve

13:18.710 --> 13:19.610
the Antelope's Tail.

13:19.610 --> 13:20.610
Do you understand?

13:20.610 --> 13:21.970
Not the girl.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.150
That's for Agent Mann.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.590
If he dies, he dies.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.322
- Samantha.

13:33.322 --> 13:36.822
What the hell are they doing to you, baby?

13:43.467 --> 13:44.760
She's in there.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.610
I'm going in.

13:45.610 --> 13:46.700
- We haven't checked the perimeters yet.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.990
Are you nuts?

13:47.990 --> 13:48.823
- Yeah, I'm nuts.

13:48.823 --> 13:50.170
- Logan, what are you thinking?

13:50.170 --> 13:51.480
- I'm thinking I got 15 minutes

13:51.480 --> 13:52.550
to get in and out of there.

13:52.550 --> 13:54.700
Or I gotta pay another
seven euros parking.

13:56.429 --> 13:58.094
Oh and if I don't make it out,

13:58.094 --> 13:59.594
you keep that meter topped up.

14:10.665 --> 14:11.498
Samantha!

14:19.968 --> 14:21.647
They knew we were coming,

14:21.647 --> 14:23.700
Monica, they were tipped off!

14:23.700 --> 14:25.047
There's a mole at MI6!

14:26.086 --> 14:28.663
I need you to find out who
just called Montenegro.

14:36.537 --> 14:37.620
- All right now.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.790
Listen carefully to me, kid, all right?

14:39.790 --> 14:41.563
This time to flush out a turd.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.789
This is the server where--

14:43.789 --> 14:44.643
- Are you gonna kill me?

14:45.732 --> 14:46.940
- What?

14:46.940 --> 14:49.059
No, why would I wanna kill you?

14:49.059 --> 14:51.416
- Because you don't like me.

14:51.416 --> 14:52.323
- I do like you.

14:52.323 --> 14:53.156
- Well, you're always mean to me.

14:53.156 --> 14:54.750
- Yeah, well you're always winding me up.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.480
Look, I don't mean to be tough.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.630
It's just, I'm a tortured soul, you know?

15:00.630 --> 15:02.280
Nothing personal.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.430
It's just the way I am.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.610
- I just think you can't love anyone

15:08.610 --> 15:11.123
because deep down you can't love yourself.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.003
- Yeah?

15:25.050 --> 15:26.483
Yeah, yeah maybe.

15:27.863 --> 15:31.857
This plague, you know?

15:31.857 --> 15:33.067
Proper barrier.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.190
Can't let anyone in it.

15:35.190 --> 15:37.230
Just let me, I need Carol.

15:38.283 --> 15:39.186
- Shh.

15:39.186 --> 15:40.019
And a child.

15:40.019 --> 15:40.852
All right?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.700
The sun doesn't always shine, yeah?

15:43.700 --> 15:45.300
It rains sometimes, you know.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.150
- Yeah.

15:46.150 --> 15:47.653
- Rains, pours down.

15:49.737 --> 15:51.000
But when the rain settles

15:51.000 --> 15:54.420
you'll see the stars
mirrored in your own eyes.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.968
- That was so beautiful.

15:55.968 --> 15:56.857
- You're good at what you do.

15:56.857 --> 15:57.857
- Thank you.

16:11.885 --> 16:13.775
- Can you just ease it
up, just a little bit?

16:13.775 --> 16:14.608
- Too late for that, mate.

16:14.608 --> 16:19.608
I'm in the zone.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.485
- Are you kidding me?

16:42.677 --> 16:46.100
Hey, Joe, is that you from Happy Car?

16:46.100 --> 16:47.924
Yeah, it's Logan here.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.938
With the little red Corsa.

16:49.938 --> 16:51.410
Oh no, no, no she's fine bro.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.580
She's cool.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.890
I was just wondering
if that premium package

16:54.890 --> 16:56.673
insurance deal was still available?

16:57.540 --> 16:59.117
Yeah?

17:00.410 --> 17:01.890
And just so I know,

17:01.890 --> 17:04.375
does that cover smashed windows,

17:04.375 --> 17:06.496
burst tire?

17:06.496 --> 17:08.270
Holes, where do you stand on holes?

17:08.270 --> 17:09.924
Oh bullet holes.

17:09.924 --> 17:11.976
No, you're getting upset, Joe,

17:11.976 --> 17:13.140
look you're really getting upset.

17:13.140 --> 17:14.390
Just stop shouting at me!

17:18.366 --> 17:22.120
- What are you doing?

17:22.120 --> 17:23.160
- Here's one for you.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.660
Is there any cover for hitting a statue?

17:25.660 --> 17:27.163
Like a human statue.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.380
Well I'm not sure if he's dead

17:29.380 --> 17:31.940
or he's just really good at his job.

17:31.940 --> 17:33.333
- He's dead, move on!

17:37.578 --> 17:39.190
- Okay, so Ann's been texting Graham.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.430
Graham's been texting Ann

17:40.430 --> 17:45.013
and Ruth has been in
contact with Lee Figures.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.394
What's little Lee Figures doing out there?

17:48.394 --> 17:49.934
- That's the page you go number.

17:49.934 --> 17:51.267
It's a...

17:51.267 --> 17:52.500
- It's a burn phone.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.343
- Calling another unknown ID in Kotor.

17:56.378 --> 17:57.728
I'm guessing the kidnapper?

17:59.050 --> 17:59.883
- Yeah.

17:59.883 --> 18:02.560
- And if we called that number

18:02.560 --> 18:04.430
whoever answered the office here...

18:05.617 --> 18:06.867
- Is the snake.

18:07.941 --> 18:08.774
Bingo.

18:09.875 --> 18:10.958
Proud of you.

18:14.272 --> 18:15.522
Big lovely boy.

18:19.334 --> 18:20.584
Hum, it's nice.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.997
- Logan, Logan the Antelope's Tail!

18:57.997 --> 18:58.904
We left it!

18:58.904 --> 18:59.809
- What?

18:59.809 --> 19:01.892
I gotta get my girl back!

19:02.966 --> 19:06.134
- I'm gonna go back and get it.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.370
- Samantha.

19:17.370 --> 19:18.272
- Logan?

19:18.272 --> 19:20.272
- It will be okay, babe.

19:24.386 --> 19:27.350
Bogohardt, I thought you were dead.

19:27.350 --> 19:28.920
- No, Mr. Logan.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.290
I've ever been more alive

19:30.290 --> 19:31.340
since I met Samantha.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.543
That's right, pussy face.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.843
You take my eye.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.510
Now I take your woman.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.993
Many, many times.

19:43.993 --> 19:45.950
- Hey, you piece of shit.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.860
She's a classy broad.

19:47.860 --> 19:49.730
Show her some respect.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.510
- I'm sorry, Logan.

19:51.510 --> 19:54.990
It's just you and I never really clicked.

19:54.990 --> 19:55.823
- Are you kidding me?

19:55.823 --> 19:57.730
I thought we were clicking
all over the place.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.700
I thought we clicked great.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.743
- You lied to me about who you are.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.443
- Yeah, to protect you.

20:02.443 --> 20:04.680
- Well that worked out well
for everyone, didn't it?

20:04.680 --> 20:06.260
Bogohardt has at least
been straight with me

20:06.260 --> 20:07.647
since the minute he kidnapped me

20:07.647 --> 20:09.500
and threw me into the back of his van.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.120
- Wow, I mean there's some
standards you're keeping.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.694
- There's no need to be bitter, Logan.

20:13.694 --> 20:15.927
- Oh no, no, no, no!

20:15.927 --> 20:17.570
That's no reason to be bitter!

20:17.570 --> 20:20.010
I just traveled 18 hours to get here!

20:20.010 --> 20:22.610
I defied the orders of
the British government,

20:22.610 --> 20:23.730
killed a human statue,

20:23.730 --> 20:24.770
really hurt my knee

20:24.770 --> 20:26.463
and have destroyed a hire car

20:26.463 --> 20:29.200
that I paid with with my own money!

20:29.200 --> 20:31.500
Just to find out that you cheated on me?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.770
- Whose fault's that?

20:32.770 --> 20:33.700
- Yours!

20:33.700 --> 20:35.490
You're fucking a guy who kidnapped you!

20:35.490 --> 20:37.830
- Oh, are you crying now,

20:37.830 --> 20:40.021
little baby shithead?

20:40.021 --> 20:42.800
Ah, face it Logan.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.093
I have won this time.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.513
- Really Samantha, this guy?

20:48.410 --> 20:51.310
I would have treated you like a princess.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.710
I was gonna take you to Disneyland.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.663
The one in America.

20:55.730 --> 20:56.823
- I'm sorry, Logan.

20:58.666 --> 21:00.350
- But I look you.

21:00.350 --> 21:01.920
- Enough.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.223
Now give me the Antelope's
Tail or you die.

21:16.935 --> 21:19.008
- Oh, buddy fuck it.

21:25.675 --> 21:26.508
Logan!

21:50.628 --> 21:51.961
- Hello?

21:54.254 --> 21:55.087
Hello?

22:12.313 --> 22:13.896
- Good work, agent.

22:15.164 --> 22:16.603
Did Logan make it out alive?

22:17.690 --> 22:19.080
No?

22:19.080 --> 22:19.913
Shame.
