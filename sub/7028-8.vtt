07:53.722 --> 07:55.789
Thanks for the offer,
but "Caliente" magazine's

07:55.824 --> 07:58.225
"Best Badonk of 2013"
is not who I want

07:58.260 --> 08:00.060
- giving the talk to Conner.
- [scoffs]

08:00.095 --> 08:02.829
Uh, also 2012.
Mm.

08:02.865 --> 08:05.165
Wait, are you giving Conner
the sex talk?

08:05.200 --> 08:07.134
My parents were
too conservative for that.

08:07.169 --> 08:10.203
They told me an angel died
every time I wore short-shorts.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.205
Mm.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.640
Oh, man.

08:13.676 --> 08:15.542
It's about time
you had the talk.

08:15.577 --> 08:17.544
I mean, how old is he?
Eight? Nine?

08:17.579 --> 08:19.479
- He's 13.
- [men groan]

08:19.515 --> 08:20.981
Why? What?
What don't I wanna know?

08:21.016 --> 08:22.883
Have you looked
under his bed?

08:22.918 --> 08:24.751
[whispers]
Yeah. It was porn-a-palooza.

08:24.787 --> 08:26.653
There was also
a picture of Ana under there.

08:26.689 --> 08:28.488
all: - Oh!
- I know, I know.

08:28.524 --> 08:30.057
It was flattering.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.926
Yeah, and...
wildly inappropriate.

08:32.961 --> 08:34.094
I can't believe
this is happening.

08:34.129 --> 08:35.595
This is my baby.

08:35.631 --> 08:38.265
He's 13.
It's totally normal.

08:38.299 --> 08:41.168
When I was 13,
I used to feel up Barbie dolls.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.703
I was shocked when I found out
real women have nipples.

08:43.739 --> 08:46.073
I rode the mechanical horse
outside the supermarket

08:46.108 --> 08:47.741
well into my teens.

08:47.776 --> 08:50.610
Yeah, when I was 13,
I had sex for the first time.

08:50.646 --> 08:52.012
- Oh...
- Hmm?

08:52.047 --> 08:54.281
- With a couch.
- Ew.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.283
Not my Conner.
He is a sweet boy.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.719
- He does all his own laundry.
- Oof, a lot of sheets?

08:58.754 --> 09:00.454
No, it's not like that.

09:00.489 --> 09:02.956
He's just very clean,
so he takes a lot of showers.

09:02.991 --> 09:05.859
all: - Oh...
- Because he gets so messy

09:05.894 --> 09:08.428
spending all that time alone
in the treehouse

09:08.464 --> 09:10.564
when he's-- Yeah, okay.
He needs the talk.

09:10.599 --> 09:13.533
Just be calm.
Don't overreact.

09:13.569 --> 09:17.371
Everything will be--
Oh, my God! I have a zit!

09:20.576 --> 09:22.542
Can you see it?

09:22.578 --> 09:25.212
So Pasión and César are stuck
in the bear trap, right?

09:25.247 --> 09:27.147
And then the drug lord
grabs Luna and kidnaps her.

09:27.182 --> 09:29.716
- Maybe he brainwashed her too.
- That's great.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.551
She thinks she's
in love with him

09:31.587 --> 09:33.387
- and then they kiss.
- Kissing?

09:33.422 --> 09:36.056
both: Ew!

09:36.091 --> 09:37.758
Dude, did you just
mix popcorn and M&M's?

09:37.793 --> 09:40.394
- Oh, yeah.
- That's brilliant.

09:40.429 --> 09:43.063
I've gotta start contributing
more to this friendship.

09:43.098 --> 09:44.264
Here.

09:44.299 --> 09:46.066
[chuckles]

09:46.101 --> 09:47.834
How about we try
Crunch Berries and pretzels?

09:47.870 --> 09:49.002
Okay.

09:49.037 --> 09:50.837
Let's do this.

09:50.873 --> 09:52.906
What do we do
about this photo shoot?

09:52.941 --> 09:54.775
I can't pretend I don't care.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.476
No makeup.
No Photoshop.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.311
What kind of animals
do they think we are?

09:58.347 --> 10:00.414
- It's just a tiny zit.
- Really?

10:00.449 --> 10:02.082
El diablo!

10:02.117 --> 10:04.017
I'm gonna say it.
I don't like this either.

10:04.052 --> 10:05.452
I have stuff to cover up too.

10:05.487 --> 10:07.587
You know, my left bicep
is smaller and weaker

10:07.623 --> 10:08.622
than my right one.

10:08.657 --> 10:12.159
Throw me that candle.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.027
See?
So weak.

10:14.062 --> 10:16.430
No, so brave.

10:16.465 --> 10:17.931
We all have flaws.

10:17.966 --> 10:20.267
- Right, Xavi?
- I don't know.

10:20.302 --> 10:23.336
I guess my lips
are so full and pouty

10:23.372 --> 10:25.605
sometimes they get chapped.

10:25.641 --> 10:27.140
I'm sorry, I'm trying.

10:27.176 --> 10:29.109
I don't have the same hang-ups
as you guys.

10:29.144 --> 10:31.144
Hey, I was born
with only one--

10:31.180 --> 10:32.813
all: Whoa!

10:32.848 --> 10:35.949
Okay. So, Conner,
I know your dad isn't here,

10:35.984 --> 10:37.517
but I have a few friends
who want to talk to you

10:37.553 --> 10:39.519
about some guy stuff.
Huh?

10:39.555 --> 10:41.054
Let me tell you what
my father told me.

10:41.089 --> 10:42.122
Boobs.

10:42.157 --> 10:44.958
- Boobs.
- Boobs.

10:44.993 --> 10:47.027
For me?
No.

10:47.062 --> 10:49.629

10:49.665 --> 10:52.199

10:52.234 --> 10:53.333

- Ana!

10:53.368 --> 10:54.801
A nun?

10:54.837 --> 10:56.336
Well, it was this
or a hot dog costume,

10:56.371 --> 11:00.173
and the hot dog costume
was surprisingly sexy.

11:00.209 --> 11:03.343
All right, Conner,
Con-man...

11:03.378 --> 11:05.045

11:05.080 --> 11:09.349
Hormones, zits, hair, girls.

11:11.787 --> 11:14.921
"Baywatch," sticky,

11:14.957 --> 11:17.424
- Can I go now?
- No, no, no, no, no, okay.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.426
Look, we're gonna talk
like adults.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.828
You are growing up.
You're becoming a man.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.664
So you got to let go
of your childhood.

11:24.700 --> 11:28.068
It's done, done-zo,
gone-zo, finito.

11:28.103 --> 11:29.402
[whistles]

11:29.438 --> 11:31.037
You're gonna have
to say good-bye.

11:31.073 --> 11:33.440
Bye, Felicia!
Bye, childhood!

11:33.475 --> 11:35.408
Okay, okay,
enough adult talk.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.177
Conner, go make
a prank phone call.

11:37.212 --> 11:39.679
- To who?
- Call your abuela.

11:39.715 --> 11:41.014
Tell her you're George Lopez.

11:41.049 --> 11:43.250
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- [laughs]

11:43.285 --> 11:44.851

11:44.887 --> 11:46.753

11:46.788 --> 11:48.255

I was-- Really?

11:48.290 --> 11:53.039
Well... I tried.
Even the nuns are slutty here.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.617
Oh!
There you are.

12:01.652 --> 12:02.952
Are you okay?

12:02.987 --> 12:04.387
I see you left the convent.

12:04.422 --> 12:05.955
Oh, yeah.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.790

to me.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.563
Hey, why did you bail
on the sex talk?

12:14.599 --> 12:16.465
Because Conner's too young.

Filling his head
with all that confusing stuff

12:18.436 --> 12:20.236

I say this out of love,

12:26.944 --> 12:28.844
which means you can't
get mad at me.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.479

you're the one not ready

12:30.515 --> 12:31.847
for the sex talk?

12:31.883 --> 12:35.017
My mom gut is telling me
he's not ready.

12:35.053 --> 12:38.320
Okay. I hear you.
I'll back off.

Let me grab my notebook.

15:58.723 --> 16:00.422
Everybody,
just leave me alone!

16:00.458 --> 16:01.757
I hate you!

16:01.792 --> 16:03.525
- [gasps]
- Ohh!

16:03.561 --> 16:04.727
Oh, honey,
he doesn't mean it.

16:04.762 --> 16:05.761
Those are just words.

16:05.796 --> 16:08.964
- And you too!
- [gasps] Oh!

16:09.000 --> 16:12.300
- Just words?
- Yeah.

16:14.339 --> 16:15.806
Conner?
Come on.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.708
Please come out.
I'm sorry!

16:17.710 --> 16:19.243
God, I can't believe
he said he hated me.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.512
No one's ever
told me that before.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.813
Twitter doesn't count.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.315
I have my GPS locator
on his phone.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.349
He's still in the building.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.684
Oh, thank God!
Okay.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.185
Let's check under the stairs.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.487
That's where I go
when I hide from you.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.655
- What?
- No, can't be mad. Focus.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.190
Look at me,
Mother of the Year.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.725
Hey, you are!

16:34.727 --> 16:36.193
Hey, those kids of yours
are wonderful,

16:36.195 --> 16:37.761
and that is all you.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.499
You were so strong
when their dad went to prison.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.334
Well, I mean,
after you came crying to me

16:43.336 --> 16:45.402
and I winded
beneath your wings.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.204
There's actually
two heroes here.

16:47.206 --> 16:51.008
Seriously, how you are
with those boys amazes me.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.776
That's the problem.
I know how to be a mom to boys.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.446
I have no idea
how to be a mom to men.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.780
Hey, ladies.
A few things.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.449
We're ready to rehearse
the final scene,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.518
we're having Chinese for lunch,
and Mimi's son

17:00.520 --> 17:01.952
is up in prop storage.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.355
Oh! Well, I guess I better
bring him down

17:04.357 --> 17:05.955
so I can have that talk,
right?

17:05.958 --> 17:08.692
- If he'll even listen.
- No, wait!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.461
I know a better way
to get through to him.

- What are you doing?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.552
Why are you doing it
in English?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.053
[whispers] All right, guys,
listen up, listen.

Conner needs a sex talk.

- Weirdly, yes.
- All right.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.063
[normal voice]
Luna, your body is changing,

17:46.065 --> 17:49.667
and you may have new feelings
and urges you don't understand.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.335
I do!

17:51.337 --> 17:53.837
And as strange
as these urges may seem,

17:53.839 --> 17:56.574
it's important for you to know
that these feelings

17:56.576 --> 17:59.577
are natural and nothing
to be embarrassed about.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.078
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.980
And those things you're doing

18:02.982 --> 18:04.415
that you think
no one else is doing?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.317
We're all doing.
Huh, right?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.484
Am I right?

18:07.486 --> 18:09.286
Yeah, just ask his couch.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.821
It's a funny time.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.957
You might even get acne
on your face,

18:12.959 --> 18:15.259
which does not end at puberty,
FYI.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.994
Conner's watching.
I think he's listening to them.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.330
And then the sperm
fertilizes the eggs,

18:19.332 --> 18:21.198
and that's where babies
come from.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.267
Shut... up!

18:23.269 --> 18:24.535
They're butchering our words.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.704
Why are we even here?

18:26.706 --> 18:30.107
And of course, you don't want
to have a baby anytime soon,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.142
so always use protection.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.144
And whenever you're ready,
we can help you with that.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.447
But you are not gonna be ready
for a very long time

18:36.449 --> 18:37.881

18:37.883 --> 18:39.350

- 18.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.286
Or 25...
which is not late.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.990
Puberty can be confusing,
so you may have some questions.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.125
Talk to somebody
who cares about you,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.994
like your mom.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.196
[chuckles]
I meant 17.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.897
He was a guy at camp.
You didn't know him.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.133
We're talking about
first times?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.369

- I get it!

I think it's just nothingness.

you got kicked out

No matter what happens,
I'm here for you.

- Oh...

- Did you see that smile?
- Mm-hmm.

of our show,
