[Lauren] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.641 --> 00:09.743
[Chloe] You can't expect me
to hide this from your father!

00:09.777 --> 00:11.545
Please don't tell.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.614
I want you to have this.
I'm just lending it to you

00:13.647 --> 00:15.516
until you can replace it
with one of your own.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.186
Steve Tanner had a private
meeting with Ellen Beals.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.753
And he's running for head
of the Parents' Board.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.090
- He can't win.
- Who can beat him

00:22.123 --> 00:24.692
at this point? What, me?

00:24.725 --> 00:27.661
Do you think you're
over-training? Don't
risk a serious injury.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.564
The Kippman Group who so
believes in you as a gymnast,

00:30.598 --> 00:31.732
is my father.

[horn honks]

00:45.579 --> 00:48.449
Would you please calm down?!

00:48.482 --> 00:49.650
[Lauren] No!
I won't calm down!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.252
There was nothing wrong

00:51.285 --> 00:53.721
with giving the Kmetkos
a little money.

00:53.754 --> 00:57.225
If there was nothing wrong,
why were you secretly funding
her Kippman Group scholarship?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.760
Because of this
reaction, frankly.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.729
Look, I donate to charities
all the time,

01:01.762 --> 01:04.031
it doesn't mean
I love them more than you.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.600
Emily Kmetko is my competition!

01:06.634 --> 01:09.570
A little extra money
wasn't gonna make
her a better gymnast.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.740
Oh, really? Because it
was your money that bought
Little Miss Charity Case

01:12.773 --> 01:15.609
the best choreographer in town
right out from under me!

01:15.643 --> 01:18.612
They're barely
scraping by, Lauren.
They need help.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.482
You didn't care about
helping them until you
started helping yourself

01:21.515 --> 01:22.650
to Emily Kmetko's mother.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.785

so burn out the lights *

01:31.292 --> 01:32.760
Emily.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.629
* You're in sight but
I know so burn out the lights *

01:35.663 --> 01:38.532
Look who's back
working at the Shack.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.434
We didn't order one
of your greasy pies,

01:40.468 --> 01:43.837
so I'm guessing you're here
for another handout?

01:43.871 --> 01:46.774
That's $1,243.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.377
I'll pay back the rest
of the money you gave us
as soon as I can.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.645
- Emily, you don't
have to do that.
- Yes, she does!

01:51.679 --> 01:53.747
How does your mother
feel about all of this?

01:53.781 --> 01:56.517
She agrees completely.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.652
You lied to us and
there's no forgiving that.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.822
* We're taking hits but you
missed now it's difficult *

02:01.855 --> 02:04.225
That's one thing
we can all agree on.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.494
* And it's terrible

02:38.492 --> 02:42.696
Thanks, Summer. So can I get
that petition from you today?

02:44.332 --> 02:46.634
Great. I'll see you then.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.674
I'm sorry. I meant to discuss
this with you last night,

02:53.707 --> 02:56.610
- but your plane got in so late.
- Discuss what?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.779
It looks like you've already
decided to run for the
president of the Board,

02:58.812 --> 03:01.282
which, when we used to
make decisions as a couple,

03:01.315 --> 03:03.584
is exactly the kind
of thing we would not do.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.819
So are you saying you
don't want me to run?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.489
Good morning!

03:10.558 --> 03:11.792
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.828
[smacks kiss]
I'll wait for you in the car.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.769
- What was that?
- She's been practicing
ever since

03:21.802 --> 03:25.706
- Sasha took her to the ballet.
- I meant the gold medal around
her neck. Is that for real?

03:25.739 --> 03:29.777
Sasha gave it to her his
to wear until she replaces
it with one of her own.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.881
Wow.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.766
Uh, thanks.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.335
Your hands are freezing.

03:54.368 --> 03:58.739
You know what they say,
cold hands, warm heart.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.775
It's called air conditioning.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.712
And I'm pretty sure
your new toy has it.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.848
Got it on loan for the day, the
company wants me to endorse it.

04:07.881 --> 04:11.018
[chuckles] Lucky you.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.755
Look, um... [clears throat]

04:14.788 --> 04:17.758
I just wanted to say, uh,

04:17.791 --> 04:22.996
that kiss, I want you to know
it didn't mean anything to me.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.734
- OK?
- That's cool.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.950
[Chloe] Lauren?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.586
May I please have
a word with you?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.756
[laughs] You know,
I would have thought

04:48.789 --> 04:50.658
that with all the money
you took from my father,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.693
just maybe you
could have bought a dress

04:52.726 --> 04:53.961
that actually fits your body.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.631
You know, I'm not even
gonna waste my breath

04:57.665 --> 05:00.934
trying to convince you that
I did not know that your dad

05:00.968 --> 05:03.504
was behind Emily's endowment,
which, for the record, I didn't.

05:03.537 --> 05:07.541
What's most important here
is this mess has shown me

05:07.575 --> 05:09.643
that secrets cause
more harm than good.

05:09.677 --> 05:13.547
And that is why I can no longer
keep you and Carter a secret.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.750
- But you promised!
- If you recall,
I didn't promise.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.852
I waffled.
Maybe that was a bad call.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.053
But I wanted you to accept me,

05:20.087 --> 05:22.322
which is not your fault.
It's mine.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.025
OK, so let me see, now that
your meal ticket is gone,

05:25.058 --> 05:28.596
- you're trying to punish me?
- This isn't about money,
Lauren.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.799
It's about doing
the right thing.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.301
So you have a choice.
Either you tell your father

05:34.334 --> 05:37.705
that you and Carter are
sexually active, or I will.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.070
[rock music plays]

06:21.482 --> 06:23.717
I'm getting the hang of this
artistic thing, don't you think?

06:23.751 --> 06:26.053
Yes and no.

06:26.086 --> 06:30.524
I pointed my feet,
extended my limbs,
lifted my chin.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.960
Your movements are becoming
technically proficient,

06:32.993 --> 06:35.529
but no, I'm still missing
the connecting fiber

06:35.563 --> 06:38.432
- between your movements
- I don't get it.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.535
I don't want to see the
technique behind the movements.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.838
I want to feel the deep emotion
brewing behind the experience.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.407
Keep working.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.010
I'm not so sure I have
any deep emotions

06:50.043 --> 06:51.712
brewing anywhere!

06:53.447 --> 06:55.683
Here's the petition
for your candidacy.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.052
According to the bylaws we
just need 15 signatures from
parents of current members.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.923
- I don't think I can run.
- Why?

07:02.956 --> 07:06.059
It's Mark. He doesn't
think it's a good idea.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.062
He's got a point.
We always vowed we would never
be those kind of parents.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.099

07:12.132 --> 07:14.502
You becoming president
of the Board

07:14.535 --> 07:16.737

the future of The Rock.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.908
Steve Tanner has an agenda,
and trust me,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.776
I know from personal experience,

07:22.810 --> 07:25.646
his agendas can sometimes
be questionable.

07:25.679 --> 07:29.517
- I know, I know.
- If Steve gets elected,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.552
all he has to do is convince
enough board members

07:31.585 --> 07:32.953
and he could
get rid of Sasha.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.155
I don't disagree
with you, Summer,

07:35.188 --> 07:37.825
but aren't you kind of biased,
since you're dating him?

07:37.858 --> 07:40.961
Kim, my personal
feelings for Sasha

07:40.994 --> 07:43.664
have nothing to do with
my professional feelings.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.634
He is a great coach,
but more than that,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.101
he is the right coach
for these girls

07:48.135 --> 07:51.204
and that's what needs
to be protected.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.247
[heavy metal music plays]

08:31.879 --> 08:36.149
- Not bad.
- I love pleasing my fans.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.652
Well, your fans were
wondering if you could
share the training cam.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.254
That is, if you're done
looking at yourself?

08:41.288 --> 08:44.091
I'll never be done
looking at myself.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.194
- Do you want me to shoot you?
- OK, but only
because it's vault,

08:47.227 --> 08:50.631
- and I need you
to follow my run.
- I'm your man.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.734
Your camera man, that is.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.771
You are my muse.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.173
Let's see it.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.885
I'm so happy you called.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.086
From what Emily said,

09:46.119 --> 09:48.055
I didn't think you ever
wanted to see me again.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.124
She feels like you
made a fool out of her.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.326
And how do you feel?

09:55.128 --> 09:57.865
I feel like what
you did was wrong.

09:59.733 --> 10:04.271
But the reasons you did it
were actually... very sweet.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.010
So you're not
breaking up with me?

10:10.043 --> 10:14.147
I'm not breaking up
with you for trying to do
something nice for us.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.718
And I wish Emily
could see it that way,

10:17.751 --> 10:19.152
but she's proud, Steve,

10:19.186 --> 10:23.123
and I need you to respect
her wishes from here on out.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.858

10:48.816 --> 10:50.283

convinced her not to.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.086
That was when she was desperate
to stay in my good graces.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.258

- OK.

Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna tell your
father together.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.873
We'll assure him we're
being safe and that
we care about each other.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.910
He might be more assured
if you told him you loved me.

11:16.944 --> 11:20.247
Oh, but wait a minute, you're
still on the fence about that.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.250

us for coming to him ourselves

11:23.283 --> 11:25.986

and adult about this.

about Lauren's dad

out there in the world,

saw something special in me.

make it all the way.

to do with gymnastics?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.187

All right.
So, what am I doing?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.229

of your routine.

13:49.262 --> 13:53.166
But as you dance, I want
you to paint the canvas.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.536
I want to see your movements
as fluid, flowing lines.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.026

that made you angry.

14:35.242 --> 14:39.312
A time when you were joyous
or a time when you felt
like you didn't even belong.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.881
- Do you have something?
- Yes.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.316
Can you feel it?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.253
Good.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.587
Now, dance.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.229
Open your eyes.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.335
Look at what you just created.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.370
Oh, my God.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.474
I did this?

15:41.508 --> 15:44.711
[Sasha] I guess you do
have some deep emotions
in there somewhere.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.115
Good job, Payson.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.184
[pants]

16:02.629 --> 16:06.533
If you hadn't given every
penny we had back to Steve,

16:06.566 --> 16:09.102
then you wouldn't be looking
through the cushions for change!

16:09.136 --> 16:11.304
Oh, so now this is my fault?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.973
I'm sorry that I need
one more quarter for the bus

16:14.007 --> 16:16.409
so that I can get to work
so that we can pay our bills.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.145
- Emily...
- Wait a second.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.280
How did you know that
I gave Steve Tanner money?

16:20.313 --> 16:24.684
I met up with him earlier today
and we talked things through.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.354
You're still seeing him,
after he lied to us?

16:27.387 --> 16:31.158
Yes, he lied, and I
don't agree with it,

16:31.191 --> 16:35.228
but I can't help but feel
that his heart was
in the right place.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.331
You know what?
I don't even care what you do.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.634
- Well, it sure
sounds like you do.
- I'm a slow learner.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.038
You know what? After you
moved us two states away
for a guy who turned out to be

16:45.072 --> 16:49.542
a tax cheat, and after you
gave our car to the guy who
pretended to be in the CIA,

16:49.576 --> 16:51.311
- I should've stopped caring.
- Thanks, Emily.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.513
Mom, has it ever
occurred to you

16:53.546 --> 16:57.184
to date one of the other
hundred thousand men in Boulder?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.252
Maybe one whose daughter
isn't out to get me?

16:59.286 --> 17:02.355
- The Rock is my life, too.
- Ugh!

17:02.389 --> 17:05.225
Can't I have
one thing that's mine?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.427
I don't even have
my own freaking room!

17:07.460 --> 17:10.263
You know what?
Here's an idea.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.699
Why don't you spend
a little less time
socializing at The Rock

17:12.732 --> 17:14.734
and get a second job
to help out around here,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.336
so that maybe, just this once,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.505
I don't have to carry
this entire family!

17:18.538 --> 17:20.707
If you even bothered to ask,

17:20.740 --> 17:23.009
you would know that I start
my new job tonight!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.277
- Great.
- Great!

17:29.782 --> 17:33.120
I know we never joined any
of the Parents' Boards

17:33.153 --> 17:35.622
at any of the other gyms
the girls went to because...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.324
As long as we remained neutral,

17:37.357 --> 17:39.626
we wouldn't risk spoiling
their experience

17:39.659 --> 17:42.329
- with our political
involvement.
- Which is fine

17:42.362 --> 17:44.697
when the girls were little and
there wasn't as much at stake.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.233
What happens if you don't win?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.569
Now, it's awkward
for Payson at The Rock,

17:49.602 --> 17:52.439
and Steve Tanner's certainly not
gonna keep you on as manager.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.774
And what if he does
send Sasha packing?

17:54.807 --> 17:57.144
- [Payson] Then we go with him.
- What?

17:57.177 --> 18:02.415
- What?
- Sasha is the only reason
I haven't given up yet.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.184
He's my only hope
to make it to the Olympics.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.187
He believes in me
and I believe in him.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.356
Do you really think any other
coach would take me now?

18:09.389 --> 18:13.226
Payson, we can't just
pick up and follow Sasha
around the country.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.196
You wouldn't have to.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.299
I can find a host family
at another gym in another city.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.435
So I work in another city,
you train in another city

18:22.469 --> 18:24.771
and Mom and Becca
live here in Boulder?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.273
What happens to us as a family?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.807
That's exactly why Mom
needs to run

18:27.840 --> 18:29.676
to be president
of the Parents' Board.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.744
To save Sasha and
keep us together as a family.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.248
- She has no choice, Dad.
- Payson, I do have a choice.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.519
And whether or not I run
is up to your dad and me.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.322
- Not you.
- Fine.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.358
I'm going to Kaylie's.
Can I borrow the car?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.828
- Sure.
- Thanks.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.307
Do you really think that
Sasha is her only hope?

19:01.908 --> 19:04.177
Ellen Beals already
sold her out

19:04.211 --> 19:07.414
when talking her into
petitioning for the National
Team when she wasn't ready.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.417
Clearly, she wants
to control the gym.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.152
She's not a good person, Mark.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.822
And we're The Rock's
only hope?

19:15.855 --> 19:19.226
If you don't want me to run,
just say so.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.361
- Would it make a difference?
- Damn it, Mark!

19:21.394 --> 19:24.297
I'm trying to make the
best decisions I can here.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.400
Is it so wrong to save The Rock?
It's our home!

19:28.935 --> 19:31.238
I thought Minnesota
was our home.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.277
Thank you,
this looks delicious.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.579
I am really good with salads.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.682
It's just, beyond that,
that things get a little risky.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.454
So I talked to Kim today
about our campaign.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.356
She's having second thoughts,

19:49.389 --> 19:50.790
but I told her how
much we needed her,

19:50.823 --> 19:53.460
with Steve Tanner
running uncontested.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.363
Anything is possible.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.898
- What?
- Is it possible to share
an evening together

19:58.931 --> 20:00.900
when we don't
discuss Steve Tanner?

20:00.933 --> 20:04.271
I'm sorry, you're right.

20:04.304 --> 20:09.342
No more mention of... he
who shall not be mentioned.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.346
- I forgot the wine.
- No, no, you sit.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.397
I hope you're not eating
cereal for dinner again

20:30.430 --> 20:33.633
because in this bag I have
one garlic roasted chicken,

20:33.666 --> 20:36.303
grilled vegetables
and julienne potatoes.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.904
[Summer] I got it.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.573
Payson! Hi.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.775
- We were just, um...
- Having salad.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.746
- Talking about business.
- Would you like to join us?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.382
Oh, no. I don't want to...

20:49.416 --> 20:52.519
I wasn't gonna stay. I was just
picking up food for my family

20:52.552 --> 20:55.655
and thought I'd drop
some off for Sasha. And you.

20:55.688 --> 21:00.226
- As a thank you for today.
- [Summer] That's
very thoughtful.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.396
Payson is onto
my poor eating habits.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.900
Well, I'll let you
guys enjoy that.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.337
And I'll...
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.271
Thank you.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.646
[clears throat]

21:19.679 --> 21:22.014
She is very fond of you.
It's sweet.

21:22.048 --> 21:25.017
Yeah, we've been
through a lot together.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.788
Would you mind
if I said grace?

21:28.821 --> 21:31.824
Oh, uh... Yeah, sure.

21:36.295 --> 21:40.032
Lord, thank you so much
for this amazing food
you have placed before us,

21:40.066 --> 21:45.037
and I thank you for
bringing such a kind

21:45.071 --> 21:49.509
and beautiful, thoughtful,
caring man into my life.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.077
Amen.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.414
Thank you.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.018
- Some wine?
- Sure.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.854
[choral music plays]

22:17.103 --> 22:19.939
[rock music plays]

22:25.445 --> 22:27.747
[applauding]

22:31.684 --> 22:34.621
Well, I'm still looking
for one thing.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.855
Who are you?

22:35.888 --> 22:38.791
I'm... Payson Keeler.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.394
No, when you're out there,
who are you?

22:41.428 --> 22:44.631
- A gymnast?
- That's exactly
what I'm seeing.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.899
A gymnast who has married
technique with artistry,

22:46.933 --> 22:50.570
but is still missing
one crucial element: story.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.540
When you're out there,
you're performing, for yourself,

22:53.573 --> 22:55.408
for the judges,
for the audience.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.644
But you need to take them
on a journey.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.480
That's what a story is.
And story will transcend

23:00.513 --> 23:04.050
your routine
from good to great.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.785
You need to become
a character in a story

23:05.818 --> 23:08.688
that will allow
your audience to escape.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.558
- What's your favorite story?
- It's stupid,

23:11.591 --> 23:13.025
but I've always
loved Romeo and Juliet.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.962
OK. Well,
after practice today,

23:15.995 --> 23:17.964
I want you to
pretend you are Juliet.

23:17.997 --> 23:21.468
I want you to imagine through
your movements seeing Romeo

23:21.501 --> 23:24.637
for the first time,
um, experience that first kiss

23:24.671 --> 23:27.707
that they have,
allow me to escape.

23:37.717 --> 23:40.520
[car revving]

23:46.693 --> 23:48.561
Good afternoon, Ms. Cruz.

23:48.595 --> 23:52.164
- [radio playing rock music]
- Ah, yes, the tortuous debate

23:52.198 --> 23:55.602
of whether or not to be
the face of a $100,000 car.

23:55.635 --> 23:59.639
Actually, it's more
like $120,000, if you
get the imported leather.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.141
Of course.
What was I thinking?

24:02.174 --> 24:05.411
I was actually wondering if
you could do me a huge favor.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.516
- What?
- The company needs a decision
by the end of the day,

24:09.549 --> 24:12.752
so I was thinking maybe
you could take a quick ride
with me, give me your opinion?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.655
Why would you
ever want my opinion?

24:15.688 --> 24:19.692
- Because you have good taste.
- Hm...

24:19.726 --> 24:22.629
- A quick ride?
- I'll have you back
before you can say,

24:22.662 --> 24:26.766
- "Austin Tucker is the
greatest guy in the entire..."
- All right, OK, I got it.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.021
[panting] Hey.

24:49.055 --> 24:52.659
What if I come over later
and we talk to your dad?
Like around seven?

24:52.692 --> 24:55.094
Sure.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.630
Lauren, look.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.567
I really do care about you.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.135
Are you sure you don't
just care about getting
kicked out of The Rock?

25:04.604 --> 25:05.905
I love you.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.810
I love you, too.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.211
See you later then?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.717
[sighs]

25:21.621 --> 25:25.257
- Summer, can I talk to you?
- Of course.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.763
I've been having sex
with Carter Anderson.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.133
And that's not all.

25:36.002 --> 25:39.739
- What else?
- OK, well...

25:39.772 --> 25:43.242
This entire time that I've
been sleeping with Carter,

25:43.275 --> 25:48.547
- Chloe Kmetko knew about it.
- Excuse me?

25:48.581 --> 25:52.652
She totally encouraged it.
She talked to me about safe sex,

25:52.685 --> 25:53.920
she bought me condoms,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.655
she even took me to the
doctor for the pill,

25:55.688 --> 25:58.024
- you know, as a backup plan.
- [laughs]

25:58.057 --> 26:00.660
Let me make sure
I understand this.

26:00.693 --> 26:04.196
Chloe knew you and Carter
were having sex

26:04.230 --> 26:06.065
and she didn't tell
your father?

26:07.299 --> 26:11.671
[sighs] You have
to tell him, Lauren.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.572
Would you tell him for me?

26:13.606 --> 26:16.208
You don't have to tell him
that Chloe knew or anything.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.244
I wouldn't want
to get her in trouble.

26:18.277 --> 26:21.648
I'm sorry, Lauren, I...

26:21.681 --> 26:23.115
I'm afraid I can't promise that.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.657
[sighs]

26:35.594 --> 26:39.331
- [rock music plays]
- * Get ready, here we go

26:39.365 --> 26:43.135
* Looking fine
Feeling good, yo *

26:51.878 --> 26:53.680
Why are we stopping?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.616
God, I love Boulder.

26:58.751 --> 27:02.121
Yeah. Yeah, I do, too.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.590
Can we head back now?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.793
Relax.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.594
Chill.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.697
Take in the nature.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.669
- What are you doing?
- Having a picnic.

27:16.703 --> 27:20.239
- But I'm not hungry.
- You work hard all day
in that gym.

27:20.272 --> 27:24.176
I just thought it'd be nice
for us to have a meal together.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.346
Well, that's, uh, that's
very nice of you, Austin,

27:27.379 --> 27:30.282
but, um, I said I'm not hungry.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.758
- Did you hear me?
- I'm hearing you.

27:38.791 --> 27:41.027
I'm just not listening to you.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.929
Take a load off.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.339
This one's one of my favorites.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.908
I get it down
at the farmers' market.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.676
You know, actually,
I just ate lunch

27:57.710 --> 28:00.379
and I'm eating dinner
with my parents, so...

28:00.412 --> 28:02.081
Come on,
just take one bite.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.682
One little bite's
not gonna hurt you.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.152
Why are you being like this?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.855
If I'm not hungry,
I'm not hungry.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.727
- Kaylie, you had lunch
five hours ago.
- So?

28:14.761 --> 28:17.429
And you went through a really
grueling practice today.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.101
My God, are you testing me?

28:22.134 --> 28:25.671
- I'm just concerned.
- Concerned?

28:25.704 --> 28:29.675
Concerned for what?
Because I don't happen to want
your farmers' market salad?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.410
All right, fine.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.224
There, are you happy now?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.093
Take me back to the gym.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.949
Kaylie, wait. Just give
me a second to explain.

29:09.982 --> 29:14.020
Please. I've had some personal
experience with gymnasts

29:14.053 --> 29:16.923
who have gotten themselves into
trouble with eating disorders.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.893
The pressure to shed
all your body fat and
stay as light as possible,

29:20.927 --> 29:23.762
it can be dangerous
if taken too far.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.332
That's funny, I thought
you didn't date gymnasts.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.768
I'm talking
about my little sister.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.038
She was trying
to follow in my footsteps.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.875
She had a lot
of natural talent,

29:35.908 --> 29:37.877
but the pressure
just got to her.

29:37.910 --> 29:42.181
She started over-training,
restricting her calories.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.482
In a matter of a few months,

29:43.515 --> 29:46.385
I couldn't even
recognize her anymore.

29:46.418 --> 29:50.089
- What happened?
- She wound up in the hospital.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.524
They said at the rate
she was going,

29:52.558 --> 29:55.995
she would have
been dead within a year.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.498
And no one ever suspected that
my smart, level-headed sister

29:59.531 --> 30:01.834
would get messed up with
something like anorexia,

30:01.868 --> 30:05.371
but she did and it
ruined her gymnastics.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.408
It ruined her life
and it almost ruined
my entire family.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.778
How is she now?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.281
Today, she's OK.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.250
It's all the tomorrows
that I worry about.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.389
* Wait here with you

30:23.422 --> 30:27.059
Look, um...

30:27.093 --> 30:29.295
I'm sorry about the way
I reacted back at the park.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.364
You didn't deserve that.

30:32.398 --> 30:38.137
And yeah, I have been
getting a little intense

30:38.170 --> 30:41.307
with my training and my diet.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.178
But I promise,
it stops today.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.447
Really?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.950
You're right.
I know you are.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.586
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.257
I just don't want
to see you hurt yourself.

31:00.026 --> 31:03.062
I just need to know...

31:03.963 --> 31:05.431
...why do you even care?

31:05.464 --> 31:07.967
I don't know, Kaylie.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.404
There's just
something about you.

31:16.642 --> 31:21.047
* It is such a common thing *

31:28.554 --> 31:32.024
Hi! I came as soon
as I got your message.

31:35.461 --> 31:38.931
Hey. Is everything OK?

31:38.965 --> 31:41.233
No, it's not OK.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.603
I found out that

31:44.636 --> 31:48.007
Lauren and... Carter Anderson

31:48.040 --> 31:51.243
have been having sex,
and you knew about it.

31:53.012 --> 31:56.382
You knew they were having sex
under my very own roof

31:56.415 --> 31:58.350
and you didn't tell me?

31:58.384 --> 32:02.921
Did Lauren also tell you

32:02.955 --> 32:04.656
that I talked to her,

32:04.690 --> 32:07.926
and I told her that if she
didn't tell you, that I would?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.528
I haven't talked to Lauren.
But believe me,

32:09.561 --> 32:13.199
I'm gonna have a very
long chat with her soon.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.568
So... how did you find out?

32:16.602 --> 32:20.306
[laughs] Summer told me.

32:21.607 --> 32:22.574
Summer?

32:22.608 --> 32:25.011
What if it had been Emily?

32:25.044 --> 32:27.379
What if I knew something that
could be damaging to her

32:27.413 --> 32:31.217
and I didn't
tell you right away?

32:33.085 --> 32:35.587
How would you feel?

32:35.621 --> 32:39.658
- I would feel like...
- You couldn't trust me?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.630
Lauren is the most
precious thing

32:44.663 --> 32:47.399
that I have.

32:47.433 --> 32:51.070
If I can't trust you with her...
with her well-being,

32:51.103 --> 32:52.638
then I don't know when I can.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.108
Steve, I would never,

32:56.142 --> 33:01.047
ever do anything
to hurt you or Lauren.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.417
I just... I'm sorry, I just
thought it would be better

33:05.451 --> 33:10.222
coming from her than me.
It was an error in judgment.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.691
I'm so sorry.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.730
Can you forgive me?

33:22.401 --> 33:24.303
I don't think I can.

33:27.306 --> 33:32.111
[sobbing] But Emily was upset
about the endowment
and I forgave you!

33:44.156 --> 33:46.625
[Chloe sobbing]

34:09.415 --> 34:12.784
- What's going on?
- Lights are out. AC is out.

34:12.818 --> 34:17.456
- Bill is not paid.
- I am so sick of this!

34:17.489 --> 34:18.724
I'm so sick of living
hand-to-mouth.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.592
I'm so sick of being
embarrassed in the gym.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.729
And I'm so sick
of my mom dating...

34:25.063 --> 34:28.467
- What's wrong?
- My arm's tingling.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.740
Where are your
anti-seizure meds?

34:34.773 --> 34:38.510
I forgot to get them refilled.

34:38.544 --> 34:40.812
- Where's Mom?
- She's at her new job.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.251
Let's get you on the floor.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.626
[whispers] OK.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.129
OK. I'm gonna get Mrs. Skomp
from next door to watch you

34:57.163 --> 34:58.730
while I go to the pharmacy, OK?

34:58.764 --> 35:03.469
- I know the drill. Don't worry.
- Hey, do I look worried?

35:04.270 --> 35:05.337
I'll be right back.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.123
[horns honking]

35:25.157 --> 35:28.727
Alrighty.
7414 Jefferson Street?
Is that still your home address?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.629
- Yeah.
- OK.

35:30.662 --> 35:35.133
- That'll be $220.
- What?

35:35.167 --> 35:36.768
No, it's a $15 co-pay.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.239
Um, the computer says your
insurance doesn't cover it.

35:40.272 --> 35:43.242
Well, the computer is wrong.
It always covers it.

35:43.275 --> 35:46.645
Well, why don't you wait
until the morning and you
can check with your provider?

35:46.678 --> 35:50.616
Because my brother is having
seizure symptoms tonight.
He needs his meds.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.718
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.322
OK, look,
how much for just two pills?

35:56.355 --> 35:59.225
The prescription's for 20.
I can't sell you two.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.760
Come on! Please?
I'm desperate!

36:01.793 --> 36:03.762
I'm sorry.
I could lose my job.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.697
This is ridiculous!
His medicine is covered!

36:05.731 --> 36:07.766
Can you please just
go and check again?

36:07.799 --> 36:09.535
- Miss...
- Please!

36:10.902 --> 36:12.638
OK.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.381
All right, just
hold on one second.

36:26.952 --> 36:30.556
No. No, I'm sorry.
I can't help you tonight.

36:46.572 --> 36:50.208
- Hey.
- Come in.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.680
[Carter] Where's your dad?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.351
He's not here.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.652
When's he coming back?

37:02.254 --> 37:04.523
Summer already
told my dad about us.

37:05.924 --> 37:09.361
- Who told Summer?
- I did.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.664
How could you do that?

37:12.698 --> 37:14.466
You know she's
gonna tell Sasha.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.234
Which is all you care about,
isn't it?

37:17.569 --> 37:19.271
I told you I loved you.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.872
Because you didn't want to
get kicked out of The Rock.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.375
- That's the only reason.
- That's not true.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.944
That's how it feels.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.880
How long did it take you
to fall in love with Kaylie?

37:28.914 --> 37:32.217
A week? A day? A moment?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.620
I gave myself to you
and you still couldn't
tell me you loved me.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.289
Until your place
at The Rock was threatened.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.326
I'm a lot of things,
I know that,

37:40.359 --> 37:42.561
but stupid isn't one of them!

37:50.836 --> 37:54.840
[door opens, slams]

38:02.581 --> 38:04.750
[woman speaking indistinctly
over TV]

38:08.420 --> 38:10.589
I know how hard it must be
to be here all alone

38:10.622 --> 38:12.057
and deal with all this.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.695
I know how hard
it must be to be away.

38:18.597 --> 38:22.468
It's just that sometimes,
when I come home,

38:22.501 --> 38:24.870
it feels like you're a whole
different family, you know?

38:24.903 --> 38:27.939
I can't imagine
how tough that is.

38:27.973 --> 38:33.479
But you have to know, you are
in our hearts, every second.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.619
Do you really think that
Sasha Belov is worth
falling on the sword for?

38:40.652 --> 38:43.889
If it comes to that?

38:43.922 --> 38:47.659
I think he's a great coach
and an honorable man.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.528
And I trust him with Payson.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.465
She's going through such
a vulnerable time right now.

38:53.499 --> 38:58.404
She's started puberty,
her body's changing and her
hormones have to be going crazy.

38:58.437 --> 39:02.508
And she's completely
reinventing herself
as a gymnast

39:02.541 --> 39:05.877
while she's becoming a woman.

39:05.911 --> 39:10.115
I think she'd be devastated
to lose the coach
she feels so safe with.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.621
OK, then.

39:15.654 --> 39:18.957
It's OK with me

39:18.990 --> 39:21.593
if you want to run for president
of the Parents' Board.

39:21.627 --> 39:24.396
So I have your permission?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.998
As if you need my permission
to do anything.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.601
But you have my full support.

39:29.635 --> 39:34.873
- What if I want something else?
- Like what?

39:34.906 --> 39:39.945
Well, Becca's at a sleepover
and Payson's working late
with Sasha at The Rock.

39:42.080 --> 39:46.084
If you think you can buy my vote
in exchange for sexual favors,
you're absolutely right.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.753
[laughing]

39:52.057 --> 39:54.493
[* Shelly Fraley:
On Her Way]

39:58.797 --> 40:02.367
* In her dreams
She escapes *

40:02.400 --> 40:06.772
* To a place she doesn't know
Someday she's gonna go *

40:06.805 --> 40:09.608
That was it.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.110
* With a fire under feet

40:12.143 --> 40:15.814
That was it!
That's fantastic!

What you just did,
the story you just told,

40:19.685 --> 40:21.620
it was... it was inspired.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.490
It's you, Sasha.
You inspire me.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.758
* Is knowing where
her heart beats at *

40:26.792 --> 40:28.494
Payson!

40:32.931 --> 40:35.166
Payson!

40:39.871 --> 40:41.673
[Emily] How are you feeling now?

40:41.707 --> 40:45.110
Just a headache.
I think we caught it in time.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.613
Good.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.881
It was nice of the neighbors
to lend us light.

40:49.915 --> 40:53.485
Yup. They brought
cookies over, too.
You want one?

40:53.519 --> 40:55.687
No, thanks.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.557
So do you know
where Mom's working?

40:58.590 --> 41:01.493
She didn't say,
just that it pays well.

41:01.527 --> 41:04.930
- I hope it pays really well.
- Why?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.434
Because we need $220.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.169
[knocking on door]

41:11.202 --> 41:13.639
Maybe Mom forgot her keys.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.648
Are you Emily Kmetko?

41:25.717 --> 41:26.585
Yes.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.987
Were you at Clute's Pharmacy
this evening?

41:32.824 --> 41:35.527
- Yes.
- You're under arrest.
