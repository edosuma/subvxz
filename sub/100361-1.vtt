What? When? Why?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.973
[chuckles] Which question
do you want me to answer first?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.976
I asked them in alphabetical order
for a reason.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.644
Okay.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.772
We did it last night.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.399
It was a completely spontaneous thing.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.778
We flew to Vegas,
we went to an all-night chapel,

01:09.861 --> 01:13.323
we were married
by a Filipino Elvis impersonator.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.158
Bayani Pang?

01:15.408 --> 01:16.367
Yeah!

01:16.451 --> 01:18.203
-Oh, Jesus.
-[slight chuckle]

01:18.286 --> 01:19.454
It was insane.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.499
It was the kind of thing
you'd do, actually.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.002
[scoffs] I was married by a cult leader,
like a normal person.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.881
I didn't just fly off in the middle
of the night without telling anyone.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.718
Yeah, well, when you say it like that...

01:34.177 --> 01:35.220
[sighs deeply]

01:36.096 --> 01:40.266
So... you're real-deal married
to this man?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.435
Yeah.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.480
I'm real-deal married to this man.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.817
Well, then...

01:49.484 --> 01:51.236
congratulations.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.405
Listen, I... I know this must be a shock,

01:54.489 --> 01:57.992
and I know you must have
a lot of feelings to process, so...

01:58.368 --> 01:59.494
so let's talk.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.662
Nope. I'm good.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.540
What? You don't want to talk?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.793
Nah. We got to get you moved
into your new home.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.129
And boxes don't pack themselves yet.

02:09.212 --> 02:14.676
[grunts] Wait, slow down, Frankie,
because I-I'm in no hurry to move out.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.429
And... because I can't catch up to you!

02:18.721 --> 02:21.766
What? I can't hear you. I'm too far ahead.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.185
[Grace] I'm in no hurry to move out.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.856
[Frankie] I can fit a lot of curry
in my mouth. You know that.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.863
When I opened my eyes and I saw
everyone there, I nearly lost it.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.449
You gave me a gift
I don't know how to return.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.493
You'll just have to love me a lot.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.373
That wasn't even a little.

02:45.456 --> 02:49.878
How about I love you a lot...
on that honeymoon we've never taken?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.006
I... I don't mean to sound like you,

02:53.089 --> 02:57.552
but we just spent a pretty penny
on Bud's wedding, so can we afford to?

02:57.886 --> 03:01.681
And I don't mean to sound like you,
but can we afford not to?

03:02.265 --> 03:04.601
We're gonna keep putting it off
for one reason or another,

03:04.684 --> 03:07.395
and then someday,
it's gonna be too late.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.190
-That does sound like me.
-Mm-hmm.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.566
I make a good point.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.525
[Robert chuckles]

03:12.609 --> 03:13.985
[clattering]

03:14.736 --> 03:15.904
What the hell?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.908
-[clattering continues]
-[water running]

03:26.456 --> 03:29.334
Peter, I didn't know
you were here already.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.627
I still have a key.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.837
I would love to get that back soon.

03:32.921 --> 03:37.050
Robert, I know I've been
a jagged little pill recently.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.136
So, to make up
for the way I've treated you,

03:40.637 --> 03:44.474
Bud and Allison's bon voyage<i> </i>lunch
is on the house.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.309
We already paid.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.186
Well, the thought was there.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.984
You aren't finished setting up, are you?
The family's going to be here soon.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.945
I'm trying to tell you something.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.530
Jeff and I had a big talk last night,

03:59.614 --> 04:04.744
and he pointed out what an awful friend
I've been to you these past months.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.996
So, I thought you should know...

04:08.039 --> 04:09.457
I'm divorcing Jeff.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.833
What?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.168
Oh, no.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.545
-I'm so sorry.
-I know.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.091
This is terrible news. How is Jeff?

04:18.633 --> 04:22.303
People always say that being
the one who is left is worse.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.307
But... I think it's harder to be me.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.184
[Sol] Hey.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.478
We're going on a honeymoon!

04:30.561 --> 04:32.897
Jeff and Peter are splitting up.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.442
We're not going anywhere good, though.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.819
I'm sad.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.822
Do you know
what a good pick-me-up would be?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.366
Work! Throw yourself right in there.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.327
Will work cure the guilt that I'm feeling?

04:46.869 --> 04:49.455
Will work calm my psychic pain?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.376
It might.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.803
-What am I looking at?
-Um, does Nick like grapes?

05:03.886 --> 05:05.388
You could take these to him.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.182
And what about expired non-fat yogurt?

05:08.641 --> 05:09.809
Frankie, what are you doing?

05:09.892 --> 05:11.978
Separating my stuff from yours.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.147
This pile is stuff
that you're definitely taking.

05:14.230 --> 05:18.359
This pile is stuff that is yours,
but I feel like I'm entitled to it.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
And that pile is mine,

05:20.528 --> 05:22.905
but it's stuff I don't want anymore,
so you can have it.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.242
Frankie, don't you think
you're acting a little Grace-ish?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.620
You went from shock to acceptance
way too quickly.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.497
You didn't even process.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.958
Not processing is my new process.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.920
I'm not buying it. You know,
maybe if you were a WASP like me,

05:38.004 --> 05:40.256
but you're not built that way.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.384
Grace, we have too much to do
to discuss how I'm built.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.721
Although I have been described in song
as a "brick house."

05:46.804 --> 05:49.515
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.768
but maybe we should go get
your talking stick.

05:52.393 --> 05:56.481
You know, give you a chance to share,
or express, or whatever you call it.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.690
I don't need to.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.402
Hey, how about we do
one of those chocolate parties?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.031
And I can bring your two-person
conflict resolution sweater.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.534
No, thank you. I'd rather we just
keep getting on with the going.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.036
All right.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.080
I'll let you bathe me.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.501
-Who are they?
-Joaquin and Ted.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.669
A little more information, please.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.921
They're chore whores.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.632
Still more information, please.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.926
They're here to help with the packing up.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.803
Don't worry, they're trustworthy.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.098
I found them online.
They've got four whole stars.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.225
Okay, that's it.
We're gonna do a sharing circle.

06:32.308 --> 06:36.312
Shows how much you know. You can't do
a sharing circle with two people.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.357
So I just say whatever's on my mind?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.985
My understanding is you...
you share what you're feeling

06:43.069 --> 06:45.655
but may not want to say
'cause you're angry.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.574
Or really angry.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.161
Well, the other day there was a thing
I'm kind of hurt about.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.538
What thing?

06:53.621 --> 06:56.707
You told me, when you picked up
a Tuesday shift, nothing would change.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.252
-And I meant that.
-You went boot shopping with Bob!

06:59.335 --> 07:02.046
-I didn't even buy anything!
-Okay, guys. Time's up.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.132
Frankie...

07:05.967 --> 07:08.010
is there anything that you'd like to say?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.888
Yes, yes. What kind of boots?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.014
[Grace] Fine.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.558
I'll share.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.769
That's right. Grace Hanson is sharing.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.770
Grace Skolka.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.399
I haven't decided
if I'm gonna change my name or not.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.985
-You just got married?
-Just.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.654
Congratulations on your nuptials.
Are you going on a honeymoon?

07:26.737 --> 07:29.282
-Not the time, Joaquin.
-Are you?

07:31.617 --> 07:32.577
Yes.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.162
Bora Bora.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.039
Are you going to that place
with the glass bottom bedrooms?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.792
You're looking at two stars, Joaquin.
Okay? Two stars.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.003
[sighs heavily]

07:43.379 --> 07:45.298
You're mad at me. I get it.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.800
-I'm not mad.
-Well, then you're in denial.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.552
No, I am not.

07:49.635 --> 07:53.222
People grow up. They get married.
It happens every day.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.976
I'm a resilient woman.
I'm gonna have my own life.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.896
I think what you're not saying is you're
worried things are gonna change.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.439
But things won't change.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.526
I mean, I may not be here at night
or... or on weekends.

08:06.611 --> 08:10.531
Or for the next ten days, but other
than that, we're in business, Frankie.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.493
Yeah, right. Now who's in denial?

08:14.994 --> 08:18.080
Look, it's not like it's gonna be,
"Nick, Nick, Nick," all day every day.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.209
You know, it's gonna be a mix.
Like, "Frankie, Frankie, Nick, Nick."

08:21.292 --> 08:22.960
Or, "Nick, Frankie, Frankie, Nick."

08:23.044 --> 08:24.962
You might want to get
your head out of your collar

08:25.046 --> 08:28.841
and accept the fact
that everything's going to change.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.802
[scoffs]

08:40.478 --> 08:41.729
I did buy boots.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.565
-[Grace exhales]
-I did.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.984
Sharon is the problem,

08:47.068 --> 08:49.195
but who do you talk to in HR about Sharon

08:49.278 --> 08:50.988
-when Sharon is our HR person?
-[phone chimes]

08:51.072 --> 08:52.615
[laughs]

08:52.949 --> 08:54.033
[Barry groans]

08:54.116 --> 08:57.662
Barry. Barry. Barry. Barry. Barry.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.580
-Sorry. Sorry, it's Erin.
-Barry. Barry.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.415
Oh. [forceful exhale]

09:01.499 --> 09:04.919
Not enough you're giving her your seed.
Now she gets your limited attention span?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.004
Hey, I know my becoming
a dad-slash-not-dad

09:07.088 --> 09:08.881
is really weird for you,

09:08.965 --> 09:13.010
but Erin and Liz have just been so open
and inclusive about the whole process.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.222
I'm not going with you
to the doctor's office.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.724
Oh, no, no, no. We're not going
to the doctor's office. No.

09:18.808 --> 09:23.187
That's how the fancies do it.
No, in vitro is crazy expensive.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.150
Okay, what exactly is
the T.J. Maxx way of doing it?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.528
It's do-it-yourself.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.868
Who's doing what to whose self?

09:37.952 --> 09:41.872
And now I'm getting confused.
I'm just masturbating myself into a cup.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
-You asked for a sip.
-You knew what this was.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.428
Hey, guys, this is Steph.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.055
She lives in San Diego,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.308
and she's here with me.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.101
You're gonna love her.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.603
Hi.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.272
[laughs]

10:06.355 --> 10:08.149
God, she makes me laugh.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.319
Oh, and don't worry,
she totally fits into our group.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.653
We have a group?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.031
You think you're in the group?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.866
[Barry] Forgive Brianna. [slight chuckle]

10:16.949 --> 10:20.202
She's just on edge because I'm giving
a little semen to an old friend.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.165
That-That didn't solve
the awkwardness problem, did it?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.042
I'm gonna get you that drink.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.046
[juicer whirring]

10:32.882 --> 10:34.258
Why would you bring a date?

10:35.092 --> 10:38.304
This whole bon voyage<i> </i>thing is just
to torture immediate family and Barry.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.766
What's the biggie?
You brought Principal Dan to the wedding.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.895
Principal Dan and I,
who I just call "Dan" by the way,

10:45.978 --> 10:47.104
have been dating a while.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.190
[Coyote] So? Dating someone a while

10:49.273 --> 10:52.818
doesn't have anything to do
with how deeply you feel for them.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.487
So how long have you two been dating?

10:54.570 --> 10:55.529
A while!

10:56.364 --> 10:57.448
[Mallory] Mmm.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.374
Um...

11:06.457 --> 11:08.834
We need to talk about
that thing I mentioned before.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.962
Of course, what else would
you talk about at a lunch?

11:14.298 --> 11:15.800
-Plenty of pathways.
-Oh.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.510
So nice meeting you.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.471
You're late. And where's your tie?

11:20.554 --> 11:21.847
I'm not working today, Peter.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.808
-Then why are you here?
-She's with me.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.436
After the wedding party last night,
I guess...

11:28.354 --> 11:29.689
romance was in the air.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.982
One thing led to another.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.027
Oh, God. Double "why are you here?"

11:35.111 --> 11:37.363
He said we were just going for lunch.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
I'm uncomfortable.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.286
So am I.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.747
Cheers.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.791
All right, I have a three-mimosa buzz,
so just hit me.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.002
[clears throat] Okay, um,
on the actual day when Erin is ovulating,

11:52.086 --> 11:53.421
uh, I do my part...

11:54.380 --> 11:56.006
-into some kind of bowl.
-Ew.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.343
Then, as... as quickly as we can, we take
the bowl to Liz in the next room--

11:59.427 --> 12:01.011
Don't know about that "we" part.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.182
And she uses a turkey baster
to suction it out of the bowl,

12:05.599 --> 12:08.102
and then, the stuff will be...

12:08.853 --> 12:11.105
basted into Erin.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.361
Do you remember that three-mimosa buzz?
It's gone.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.617
Are you holding any Xanax?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.787
-Mom!
-Oh, right. Right, right, right.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.414
[door opens]

12:29.874 --> 12:31.125
Oh, God. Thank God you're here.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.419
There's my beautiful new bride.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.545
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bride.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.714
Wow, welcome to day two.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.507
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.343
I'm still walking on air, believe me.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.472
I'm so happy I married you,
which is why we shouldn't tell anyone.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.267
Because people don't like hearing
about happy things at parties?

12:48.350 --> 12:50.686
No, I just... I don't want
everybody all thrilled for us

12:50.770 --> 12:54.356
and totally forget about Bud and...
[groans] ...the other one.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.441
Allison.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.069
-Allison?
-Yeah. So, mum's the word.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.947
But wait... But you told Frankie.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.699
-Yeah.
-And?

13:04.116 --> 13:05.117
It didn't go well.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.244
Ah, well, that's why
you don't want to tell anyone.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.456
-It's not about Bob and Allison.
-I just got to get Frankie through this.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.459
And if we make a big public announcement,
it's only gonna make it worse.

13:14.877 --> 13:15.920
Come here.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.342
There's the happy couple!

13:22.843 --> 13:23.761
What's wrong?

13:23.844 --> 13:26.138
-Just a touch of post-nuptial depression.
-[whimpers]

13:26.680 --> 13:30.351
It's like postpartum depression,
but with no science behind it.

13:30.434 --> 13:34.230
Gwyneth Paltrow warned us
this might happen. It's a real thing.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.272
But is it?

13:35.356 --> 13:36.690
Oh, it's real.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.567
I had it for 40 years once.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
-[gasps]
-But my second marriage

13:40.694 --> 13:41.904
cleared it right up. [chuckles]

13:41.987 --> 13:42.822
Coats, please.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.326
[Frankie] Gather up, everybody! Gather up!

13:47.409 --> 13:49.620
Raise your glasses, people.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.832
Or raise your joints, cooler people.

13:53.457 --> 13:57.920
It's my great honor
to toast the new bride and groom.

13:58.796 --> 14:02.216
My friend Webster defines marriage
as a huge mistake.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.510
-I thought I was giving the toast.
-[Frankie] But he's wrong about that.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.221
-It's fine.
-Like he's wrong about so many things.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.265
The shape of the Earth comes to mind.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.851
-But I woke up early to work on it.
-[Frankie continues inaudibly]

14:11.934 --> 14:13.352
You can give yours later.

14:13.644 --> 14:17.147
I missed Mass this morning
for the first time in 14 years.

14:17.565 --> 14:21.277
Of course, I'll go to two extra Masses
this afternoon to make up for it,

14:21.360 --> 14:22.695
-but I prefer the early--
-Robert!

14:23.279 --> 14:25.197
[Frankie] Regardless of how he felt,

14:25.281 --> 14:29.702
these two lovebirds
are perfect for each other in every way.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.914
-Had a better opening.
-So join me in hoisting one...

14:34.623 --> 14:36.125
to the newlyweds...

14:37.710 --> 14:38.961
Grace and Nick!

14:39.044 --> 14:40.546
[Bud] What? What is she talking about?

14:40.629 --> 14:41.839
[Brianna] What's going on?

14:43.507 --> 14:45.926
Grace and Nick got married last night!

14:46.218 --> 14:48.345
Seriously? You're married?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.348
Is this just Frankie nonsense?

14:51.432 --> 14:54.852
No. This is Grace nonsense.
Come over here. Come here.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.357
They flew to Vegas
and got married by Elvis.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.235
-Surprise!
-Why on Earth would you do that?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.904
I said "surprise."

15:04.987 --> 15:07.364
No offense, Mom, but how drunk were you?

15:07.448 --> 15:09.533
-None taken.
-Oh, some taken.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.620
It's just unlike you
to be so impulsive and--

15:12.703 --> 15:13.871
[Grace] And what?

15:13.954 --> 15:16.790
Marry a great guy
who's really nice to my family

15:16.874 --> 15:18.626
-for no reason I can discern.
-[exhales]

15:18.709 --> 15:19.960
And he has a great head of hair.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.631
And at 80, you really don't want
a long engagement.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.633
Or any engagement, apparently.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.760
This-This is wonderful!

15:28.427 --> 15:31.263
This is a wonderful surprise.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.598
Isn't that right, Robert?

15:33.641 --> 15:34.683
Yes, of course.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.562
Do you think any of this
might work for Nick and--

15:38.646 --> 15:39.980
Wait. Wait a second.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.608
Does this mean I'm an heiress now?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.360
Not if you keep acting like this.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.779
Felicitations, papa.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.114
[whispers] Thanks a lot, Frankie.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.408
I was trying to go low-key on this.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.244
Why? Everyone would like to hear the story

15:54.328 --> 15:58.165
of how Nick whisked you away
and made you his wife all of a sudden.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.293
Please, everybody, just forget about us.

16:01.377 --> 16:05.297
Today we're sending off Bud and Allison.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.300
[Frankie] Oh, they're fine.
Yesterday was their day.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.761
This is all about you now.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.933
Just take it on the chin and remember...

16:16.433 --> 16:18.560
you're richer than everyone here.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.562
But I'm not.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.107
That is a bummer.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.027
[Coyote exhales]

16:27.111 --> 16:28.696
I'm really worried about my mom.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.364
I should probably go.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.367
There's obviously some family stuff
going down.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.119
[stammers] God, no. No.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.872
I'm so grateful that you're here.
I feel really supported, Steph.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.666
We met last night.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.127
And no one calls me Steph!

16:44.336 --> 16:45.170
Bud.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.219
Wipe that "poor Frankie" look
off your face,

16:52.302 --> 16:54.722
or I swear I will hurt you non-violently.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.098
I didn't say anything.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.935
And frankly,
I'm concerned not a whit about you.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.187
You know, when you're trying to hide
that you're worried,

17:02.271 --> 17:04.064
you say things like "not a whit."

17:04.148 --> 17:07.026
Poppycock. I used it a fortnight ago.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.277
Oh, begone!

17:08.360 --> 17:09.486
[door opens]

17:11.363 --> 17:12.197
[whispers] Good luck.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.161
How ya doin', Mom?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.830
Oh, boy. [exhales]

17:19.913 --> 17:23.584
I know you've had it with us
worrying about you, but this is different.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.919
And yet, it's sounding exactly the same.

17:26.003 --> 17:29.840
I think what Bud means is that now
you're gonna be out there all alone.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.260
It's bound to be a tough transition.
For anyone.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.345
Hey, how about Coyote moves in
for a little while?

17:35.804 --> 17:37.681
-Excuse me. I have a life.
-Oh.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.058
I'm sorry, who are you?

17:39.683 --> 17:41.894
I don't know. I left my body an hour ago.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.856
-Ah, thank you.
-[Frankie] Mm.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.367
Congrats on the marriage.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.912
Hope it lasts longer than mine.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.956
Well, I'm sure
there's a sad story in there,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.084
but would you vodka up this mimosa?

18:05.834 --> 18:09.797
And while you're at it,
hold the orange juice and the champagne.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.381
And the champagne flute.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.842
[stammers] Bring me a bottle of vodka.

18:15.719 --> 18:19.723
Well, I'm thrilled for you.
Congratulations!

18:20.224 --> 18:23.727
After being married to me, you deserve
all the happiness in the world.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.646
Thank you.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.397
And I'm crazy about Nick.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.776
Oh, my God, how mad would you be
if I stole him from you?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.780
But seriously, I'm thrilled for you.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.034
-Ah.
-Just like you like it.

18:46.875 --> 18:51.004
It's tricky because it has to be
wide enough to catch everything.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.716
You have to aim, Barry.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.719
Can't just be a garden hose
that no one's holding.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.180
Yeah, but it can't be too wide
or too flat on the bottom,

19:00.264 --> 19:03.725
or else the turkey baster
won't be able to suck it all up.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.810
But...

19:06.895 --> 19:07.896
What?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.732
It's low-fat.
I'll still look good in my bathing suit.

19:13.902 --> 19:14.987
-Excuse me.
-What the...?

19:19.867 --> 19:20.742
Huh.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.955
Thanks for coming, guys.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.922
That's really good.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.799
Mmm.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.217
[exhales]

19:40.637 --> 19:43.515
We need to talk
about your feelings, Frankie.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.101
You can't Charleston Chew them away.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.686
You have a Snickers anywhere?

19:48.061 --> 19:52.399
This is a big blow, emotionally.
It's got to be tough on you.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.235
Finding out <i>Ray Donovan</i>
was going into its final season,

19:55.319 --> 19:56.820
that was tough on me.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.863
I don't believe you.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.073
[scoffs] It was in <i>Entertainment Weekly.</i>

20:00.157 --> 20:01.950
I don't believe you about Grace.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.287
This is like Lucy without Ethel.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.414
The Lone Ranger without Tonto.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.292
Who the hell are any of the people
you're talking about?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.962
This is a big deal,
and you're acting like it's not.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.340
I can live on my own, Sol.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.051
I... I know you can live on your own.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.344
But...

20:21.094 --> 20:23.013
do you really want to?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.265
[exhales]

20:26.016 --> 20:27.684
It isn't my choice.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.103
[inhales deeply]

20:30.187 --> 20:31.939
So, yes, I'm terrified.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.026
It's... It's not a weakness to admit that.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.695
Not for me. I'm terrified for Grace.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.572
-Why?
-[exhales]

20:40.656 --> 20:44.159
I'm afraid she got married
just because we had a terrible fight.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.702
And I know her, Sol.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.829
I know she'll regret it.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.416
And it might be long after she's dead,
but she'll regret it.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.793
How do you know?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.795
In all the time she's been with Nick,

20:54.878 --> 20:57.839
she never said one word
about wanting to marry him.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.300
So, yes, I'm terrified...

21:01.051 --> 21:04.054
that my best friend
just made a huge mistake.

21:13.355 --> 21:17.317
Usually, people celebrate a wedding.
Your kids decided to go another way.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.278
Well, I'm sorry, Nick.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.156
Sometimes they can't help being dicks.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.326
[chuckles] It's fine. The nice one
already apologized to me.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.455
And I... I don't care how they feel.
All I care about is how you feel.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.668
[exhales] I don't know.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.170
I feel bad about Frankie.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.588
[inhales deeply]

21:38.672 --> 21:40.924
I mean, maybe we shouldn't have
just run off and done it,

21:41.008 --> 21:42.384
you know, without telling anyone.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.512
I mean, she's my best friend.
She should have been there.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.604
Steph was a waiter
at the wedding last night.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.524
Pigs-in-a-blanket, mini gazpachos,
she's dressed like a waiter.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.152
Great. You nailed her credits.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.572
But why would you bring someone here
you just met last night?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.157
Because she said yes.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.200
Where is she, anyway?

22:07.909 --> 22:09.828
She's asking Peter for overtime.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.496
[Steph speaking indistinctly]

22:11.580 --> 22:12.622
[Coyote exhales]

22:14.583 --> 22:15.417
Okay.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.504
I get it. It was stupid bringing her here.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.466
I'm just sick of always
showing up at these things alone.

22:22.966 --> 22:26.511
Hey, that was me
for a year after my divorce.

22:26.928 --> 22:30.015
Actually, that was also me
during my marriage.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.768
It just seems like everyone has somebody.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.227
Even Brianna and Grace.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.022
And those two
aren't exactly everybody's cup of tea.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.815
Look, I know you want to find someone.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.734
And you will.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.152
But you can't push it.
