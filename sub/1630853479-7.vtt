WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.045
I'm Tom Swift.
Inventor, billionaire,

00:04.087 --> 00:06.172
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.214 --> 00:08.383
But none of that was good enough
for my dad.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.260
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:10.301 --> 00:11.720
I could earn his love,

00:11.761 --> 00:13.513
but his mission
ended tragically.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.515
Or so I thought.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.767
Turns out it was sabotage.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.394
My father survived the attack

00:19.436 --> 00:20.979
and sent me a message capsule

00:21.021 --> 00:22.981
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.984
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.527
Now I have to find the pieces

00:27.569 --> 00:29.779
of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.740
A global conspiracy
called The Road Back

00:31.781 --> 00:33.867
is standing in my way,

00:33.908 --> 00:35.368
so I can only trust my squad:

00:35.410 --> 00:36.953
my best friend, Zenzi,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.289
my bodyguard, Isaac,
my adopted brother, Lino,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.249
and my AI, Barclay.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
Together,
we're going to find my father

00:43.043 --> 00:45.045
and bring him home.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.508
TOM (echoing):
Isaac.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.267
ZENZI: Isaac,
please stay with us.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.477
BARCLAY:
He can't hear you.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.437
The thallium-based toxin
I detected

01:02.479 --> 01:04.230
is causing swelling
in his brain.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.025
No response from
the Swift family doctor yet.

01:07.567 --> 01:12.238
I am going to find an antidote
for this poison.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.199
Barclay,

01:14.240 --> 01:16.284
what did the GPS
on Isaac's car say?

01:16.326 --> 01:19.287
Last night, Isaac drove
to a parking garage in Flatbush,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.706
then to his own residence
at midnight

01:21.748 --> 01:23.083
and then to Swift Manor.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.126
Well, um,
could someone have poisoned him

01:25.168 --> 01:26.211
right before
he got here?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.337
Not necessarily.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.755
Thallium is notoriously slow.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.091
The poisoning
could have happened any time

01:31.132 --> 01:32.092
within the last few days.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.969
Or last night. Uh...

01:35.011 --> 01:37.138
What was so important
in Flatbush?

01:37.180 --> 01:39.307
It was
Rowan's parking structure.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.188
He went to Rowan's apartment?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.065
It was probably
because Rowan's DNA

01:47.107 --> 01:48.733
was on the packaging
of the capsule piece

01:48.775 --> 01:51.027
he anonymously sent.
Wait.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.113
Rowan sent the capsule piece?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.823
How does Rowan know
about the capsule piece

01:54.864 --> 01:56.199
in the first place?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.076
IDK, but the last person
who questioned Rowan

01:58.118 --> 01:59.702
ended up
with thallium poisoning.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.829
(phone ringing, buzzing)

02:00.870 --> 02:02.956
Dr. Kay is returning your call.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.165
(chimes)

02:04.207 --> 02:06.000
I'm an hour away.
How are his vitals?

02:06.042 --> 02:08.294
AUTO-ATTENDANT:
Blood pressure 145/95.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.921
Respiration shallow.
Well, should we...

02:09.963 --> 02:11.798
Should we take him
to the hospital?
KAY: No.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.508
Any movement
could cause a stroke.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.135
(sighs)
Besides,

02:15.176 --> 02:17.512
The Road Back might have people
at the hospital, too.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.930
KAY:
Isaac will need

02:18.972 --> 02:20.473
potassium chloride
and Prussian blue

02:20.515 --> 02:22.308
to flush the thallium
from his body.
TOM: Okay,

02:22.350 --> 02:24.519
I can get those in the lab
at Swift Enterprises.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.312
I'll see you there, Dr. Kay.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.399
(phone ringing, buzzing)
BARCLAY: Incoming call
from Quinn. Urgent.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.317
Hey. This is not a good time,

02:31.359 --> 02:34.487
Quinn.
I think you mean "thank you."

02:34.529 --> 02:36.156
And you have a visitor.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.324
Congress guy. Eskol. He's asking

02:38.366 --> 02:41.619
about the Hudson River
clean energy project.
ZENZI: Wait.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.997
Is-is Rowan with him?
QUINN:
If by "Rowan"

02:44.038 --> 02:46.416
you mean "the baddie
with the earring..." (chuckles)

02:47.709 --> 02:49.961
Hello?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.338
You know,
it's hard to understand

02:52.380 --> 02:54.340
why Quinn feels
so underappreciated.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.010
Look, we don't have time
for Eskol right now.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.928
We have to save Isaac.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.097
The Hudson River project
is huge PR for us.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.225
We need to go to the office
and keep up appearances.
Okay.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.227
Okay.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.021
Um...

03:08.062 --> 03:10.607
We need to put on an outfit
that says "business"

03:10.648 --> 03:13.860
instead of
"our friend is dying."

03:13.902 --> 03:15.320
You take care
of Eskol.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.779
I'll go to the lab

03:16.821 --> 03:19.240
and then get what we need.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.700
Okay.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.085
I got you. Okay?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.505
(sighs)

03:34.547 --> 03:37.383
Barclay, text Lino.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.676
(sighs)

03:38.718 --> 03:40.261
"Isaac needs you.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.930
And bring Mom."

03:42.305 --> 03:46.809
Tell Reverend Jones our
timetable needs to accelerate.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.145
I can't say more. I...

03:49.187 --> 03:50.939
I received some information
that makes me believe

03:50.980 --> 03:53.149
our project is in danger.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.568
Thank you.
MAN (on phone): Yes, ma'am.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.403
(phone beeps off)
Aunt Lorraine,

03:57.445 --> 03:59.822
something happened.
Before you say
anything else,

03:59.864 --> 04:01.324
there are secrets being kept
in this house.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.202
How long have you known
Barton was still alive?

04:04.577 --> 04:06.996
Tom told me a few weeks ago.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.831
I'm glad he finally told you.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.250
Aren't-aren't you happy?

04:10.291 --> 04:13.461
Yes, happy can't even begin
to describe it.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.298
But I am afraid
of what might come next

04:17.340 --> 04:19.592
from the people
who wanted my husband dead.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.261
That's what I came to tell you.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.263
They hurt Isaac.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.639
Wait, what?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
Zenzi found him
in the observatory.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.935
Wait a minute. What
was Isaac doing here?

04:28.977 --> 04:32.105
I let him go after
the cotillion.

04:32.146 --> 04:32.647
What?

04:32.689 --> 04:35.108
Lino, he wanted to
tell you himself.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.986
You fired him
because he found my real mom?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.738
He was helping me!
Angelino Kareem Swift,

04:40.780 --> 04:43.950
you better take that bass out of
your voice when you speak to me.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.453
I do not have to
explain myself to you.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.581

Uh, maybe we climb up
the outside wall

04:58.506 --> 05:00.967
and break in through a window?
No. If the
electricity's out,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.885
the observatory
becomes a panic room.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.137
The windows can withstand

05:04.178 --> 05:05.638
a missile strike,
and this fire door

05:05.680 --> 05:07.724
is impenetrable.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.809
The lift is our only way
to reach Isaac.

05:09.851 --> 05:14.731
So, if we can't open this,
we are f...
Uh, language.

Listen, you worry about

You're looking snatched

07:43.880 --> 07:45.298
and unannounced.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.175
Thank you. Claire said
I should stop in here,

07:47.216 --> 07:49.010
check in on things
while she's in Boston.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.637
Oh...
So thoughtful of her.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.806
Congressman Nathan Eskol,

07:53.848 --> 07:55.141
this is Susannah Robb.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.642
Hi.
The funding genius

07:56.684 --> 07:58.936
who has almost
as many followers as me.
(chuckles)

07:58.978 --> 08:00.646
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.607
I appreciate what you're doing
for your district.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.484
ESKOL: Thank you.
I saw your name
in the public disclosures

08:04.525 --> 08:05.735
for the energy project.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.488
Speaking of that,
I need to step away

08:08.529 --> 08:10.490
to set up the conference room
for a meeting,

08:10.531 --> 08:14.452
and I could use a hand
moving around some furniture.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.245

08:16.287 --> 08:19.165
You're...
good with your hands.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.083
Huh?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.252
Got permission? Okay.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.379
Meanwhile,
my excellent colleagues

08:25.421 --> 08:27.006
will update you

08:27.048 --> 08:28.674
(chuckles softly)
Great.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.552
If you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna take this quickly.
Uh,

08:31.594 --> 08:33.012
shall we?
Absolutely.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.931

08:36.057 --> 08:37.058
Hmm. Waiting for him

08:37.099 --> 08:38.267

No.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.686
Um, just checking
on my incubator.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.730
Mm.
Just trying to decide
which young innovator

08:42.772 --> 08:44.190
is gonna represent us

08:44.232 --> 08:45.525
at the Black Tech and
Engineering Conference.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.902
Yeah. And waiting
for him to text you back.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.487
I get it.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.697
Just remember, the good ones,
they don't leave you on read.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.032
Excuse me.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.659

Um, so,

08:59.080 --> 09:00.540
allow me to show you
the rest of the office.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.918
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Claire's office
is beautiful.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.299
Isaac went to ask you
why you sent that capsule piece.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.426
(exhales)
You poisoned him.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.345
Now, you're gonna fix it.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.556
Calm yourself.
Or what?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.892
(scoffs)
Your boss will notice?

09:19.934 --> 09:23.271
Maybe I should let him know
you've been playing both sides.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.607
Or you can give me
some answers.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.901
I didn't poison anyone.

09:28.943 --> 09:29.443
But from what I gathered

09:29.485 --> 09:32.488
in Eskol's conversations
this morning,

09:32.530 --> 09:35.658
Isaac wasn't the
target. You were.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.125
AUTO-ATTENDANT:
Blood oxygen level below 85%.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.587
Hypoxemia warning.
Four to six hours?

09:47.628 --> 09:50.464
(thuds)
No, I don't care that
the entire grid is down.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.300
There's someone in need...
(line disconnects)

09:53.926 --> 09:56.220
He did not just
hang up on me.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.222
Some people don't like
being yelled at.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.058
Yeah, well, I wasn't yelling.
I was trying to help Isaac.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.935
Oh, now you care about him.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.980
I've always cared.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.317
He was just an employee, right?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.912
BARTON:
Ah. There she is.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.748
You must be our new hire.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.291
Mm. Hi, darling.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.628
Allow me to introduce my bride.
ISAAC:
Ah.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.254
Ma'am.
(Lorraine chuckles)

10:30.296 --> 10:33.674
Darling, you need to return
the book from Reverend Jones.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.551
You left it in the study.
I... Mm.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.094
Lorraine is protecting me.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.556
The reverend is particular
about her lending library.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.850
(chuckles)
That she is.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.148
Uh, headed to church?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.442
Oh, yes. Every Sunday. Mm-hmm.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.111
You'd be welcome
to join us sometime.
Oh.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.489
Let's just say it's not for me.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.449
(door closes)

10:59.158 --> 11:00.910
BARTON:
Okay.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.953
Okay.
We'll be back
this afternoon.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.290
In the meantime, please
acquaint yourself with our son.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.542
The lift at the
end of the hallway

11:08.584 --> 11:10.961
will take you directly
to Tom's workshop.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.130
He told me he's busy

11:13.172 --> 11:16.842
on some kind of special
project. Confidential.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.210
Why do you still have

I'm your new bodyguard.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.297
BARCLAY:
Your full-time vibe killer
has arrived.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.634
Isaac Vega starts today.
Whomp, whomp.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.845
Another bodyguard? Okay.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.888
Let's see
how long this one lasts.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.515
I'll be over
there if you want

12:04.557 --> 12:06.517
to guard my body.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.450
Yeah.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.701
Come on,
you got to get out.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.077
Let's go.
Yo, who invited Stacy Adams?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.246
Et tu, Parker?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.998
Hey, hey, hey.
Wh-Where y'all going?

12:29.039 --> 12:30.541
Y'all, don't listen to him.
I'm Tom Swift.
Let's go. Let's go.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.376
Go on home, man. Put
some damn clothes on.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.044
MAN 2:
It's called fashion.
It's Sunday.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.338
You should be praying
instead of twerking.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.465
Bye, Rashad.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.341
The hell you got on?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.055
Setting aside the fact that
The Road Back wants me dead,

12:45.097 --> 12:47.475
we're looking for Prussian
blue and potassium chloride

12:47.516 --> 12:48.976
to help Isaac.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.811
My physician says those
should flush the poison out.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.563
I checked the lab's
stock report,

12:52.605 --> 12:55.024
but somehow
nothing's in the lab

12:55.065 --> 12:57.151
even though the inventory
was just there this morning.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
Barclay, get an
ETA from Dr. Kay.
BARCLAY: I got you.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.532
In the meantime, Prussian
blue and potassium chloride

13:03.574 --> 13:04.909
are the best chemicals,

13:04.950 --> 13:07.328
but they're not the only
ones that we can use.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.288
The lab has no supplies, though.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.708
Then we need to clear
out the offices instead.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.670
Look inside the employees'
personal medicine cabinets.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.469
Tom's been working on a
prototype called Swiftsight.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.222
It will be his most
cerebral invention yet.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.934
(phone chimes)
AUTOMATED VOICE:
New voice mail from Lino.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.520
(beep)
LINO:
Hey. Isaac's getting worse,

13:32.561 --> 13:34.605
and we still can't open
the fire door.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.774
We could really use you and Tom.
Get to Swift Manor

13:36.816 --> 13:38.442
as soon as you can.
ESKOL:
Ms. Fullington.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.944
(chuckles softly)
Could I have a moment?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.028
Yeah.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.571
Look, uh,

13:42.613 --> 13:46.033
the way our dinner ended
the other night was, um...

13:46.075 --> 13:47.451
not ideal.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.411
But I must say
that I haven't been ghosted

13:49.453 --> 13:50.955
since Jane Vasquez

13:50.996 --> 13:52.122
in high school.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.542
I think I like Jane.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.669
Can we move past this?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.963
I've always found
that the second date

13:59.004 --> 14:00.130
is the true barometer.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.298
Your persistence is noted.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.342
So is your hesitation.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.011
Look, how can I
put your mind at ease?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.848
What have you been up to
these past few days?

14:08.889 --> 14:11.642
Uh, Congress.
(chuckles softly)

14:11.684 --> 14:13.352
But I-I must say
that I am skilled

14:13.394 --> 14:14.979
at balancing work
and pleasure.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.107
Mm. With all your trips
outside of D.C. and New York?

14:18.148 --> 14:20.609
Look, I-I conduct business
for my district when I travel,

14:20.651 --> 14:22.152
but I'm seeing family.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.113
I mean, I-I have
a cousin in Dallas,

14:24.154 --> 14:25.656
an uncle in Portland...
Yeah.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.659
So you're visiting family
when you take trips.
Yes.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.912
Family is very important to me.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.914
This world

14:33.956 --> 14:38.252
doesn't value human connection
as much as it should.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.341
Could I borrow Zenzi? I'm having

14:44.383 --> 14:45.885
some issues
with the presentation.

14:45.926 --> 14:49.972
Her passwords are a lot
more complicated than mine.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.183
Isaac's running
out of time.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.811
I have a plan, but I need
this building to be empty.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.646
It's the middle
of the workday.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.982
(scoffs) Do I need
to explain work to you again?

15:00.024 --> 15:02.818
Okay, tell everyone
there's a heating emergency

15:02.860 --> 15:04.612
and that they need
to evacuate now.
(sighs)

15:04.653 --> 15:06.739
Barclay, commence
Operation "Hot in Herre."

15:06.780 --> 15:08.240
BARCLAY:
Temperature rising.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.867
I am getting so hot

15:09.909 --> 15:11.869
♪ I wanna take my clothes off. ♪

15:11.911 --> 15:15.039
(scoffs)
Wait till you hear
him sing Ashanti.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.166
(alarm blaring)

15:27.384 --> 15:29.470
ZENZI: Quinn.
What are you doing?

15:29.511 --> 15:30.679
Did you not hear
the announcement?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.681
The heating system
is in overdrive.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.683
Well,
I actually kind of like it warm.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.227
Uh, BT dubs,
I'm totally allowed

15:37.269 --> 15:38.270
to be in here.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.563
I'm actually working

15:39.605 --> 15:41.023
on that clean energy
press release

15:41.065 --> 15:42.316
in Canva.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.737
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.030
Okay.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.907
(grunts)

15:49.949 --> 15:52.409
Okay. Uh...
(hums)

15:52.451 --> 15:55.329
Thank you.
(singsongy):
Yes, you're welcome.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.832
(alarm continues blaring)

16:03.671 --> 16:06.173
Okay, Barclay.
Turn the heat off.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.842
(beeping)

16:11.011 --> 16:14.264
Barclay, turn the heat off!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.686
(lock clicks)

16:23.774 --> 16:25.484
(grunts)
Somebody!

16:25.526 --> 16:27.528
(muffled):
Quinn?!

16:27.569 --> 16:29.279
Quinn!

16:29.321 --> 16:31.949
Barclay, why can't you hear me?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.243
(coughing)

16:35.995 --> 16:38.205
Barclay!

16:38.247 --> 16:39.665
(door handle jiggling)
(grunts)

16:39.707 --> 16:41.333
Barclay!

16:49.341 --> 16:51.593
(gasping)

16:59.184 --> 17:00.853
Zenzi.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.564
Zenzi!

17:03.605 --> 17:05.315
(pounds glass)
Zenzi!

17:11.405 --> 17:13.407
(glass shatters)

17:15.117 --> 17:17.411
(indistinct chatter)

17:18.370 --> 17:19.747
Can I get a doctor?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.832
Need a doctor
over here, please.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.043
Hey. You okay?

17:24.084 --> 17:26.253
Yeah, you're gonna be okay.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.338
All right.
TOM:
Barclay,

17:28.380 --> 17:29.214
why can't we get
this temperature back to normal?

17:29.214 --> 17:33.802
BARCLAY:
The building's thermostat
hasn't responded to my attempts.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.804
It's odd.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.016
We're looking for anything
that shares ingredients

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060
with Prussian blue and
potassium chloride.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.519
To create a stopgap antidote.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.730
It's the best I can do
until Dr. Kay shows up.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.530
(exhales)
Ooh!

17:56.116 --> 17:58.619
Look, I can't do this
if I get a heatstroke.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.039
(zipper rasps)
(chuckles)

18:03.749 --> 18:05.417
Per the auto-attendant,

18:05.459 --> 18:07.711
Isaac is on the brink
of organ failure.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.713
Hurry!

18:39.159 --> 18:40.994
(grunts)

18:41.036 --> 18:43.664
(exhales)

18:51.213 --> 18:53.799
You've been here
for two whole weeks,

18:53.841 --> 18:58.137
and you still haven't taught
me any self-defense moves.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.721
I'm dealing
with the insurance claim

18:59.763 --> 19:01.765
for your stolen watch.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.476
(exhales) Wouldn't it
make your job easier

19:04.518 --> 19:06.854
if I knew how to fight?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.570
(sighs)
Fine.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.197
Come on.
Okay.

19:24.288 --> 19:28.375
All right. Shift your
hips to one side,

19:28.417 --> 19:32.296
giving an opening
to the groin.
Okay. Okay.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.631
Focus.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.217
Just getting my footing.
That's all.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.555
Now raise your
opposite elbow to turn.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.726
All right. And then I...

19:45.767 --> 19:47.436
All right. Like this?

19:47.477 --> 19:48.770
(grunts)

19:48.812 --> 19:50.772
Oops.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.108
Uh, no.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.738
No, I don't mix
work and... this.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.328
Ugh. Hang on a second.
There's something in the couch.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.541
Huh. I guess it wasn't stolen.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.252
I must have forgotten it here
before the party.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.255
My bad.
Seriously?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.633
That watch is worth 50 Gs.

20:17.674 --> 20:21.094
I know. I bought it.
A year's income
for most people.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.512
More than a year.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.224
Now you're mad because I'm rich?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.768
My best friend Keke is
locked up for something

20:27.809 --> 20:29.311
she didn't even do.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.105
If I had 50 Gs
in my couch cushions,

20:32.147 --> 20:33.482
I could bail her out.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.485
But you'll never know
a pain like that.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.281
Okay, you need 50?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.908
Got you, bro.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.786
What's your payment app?

20:45.827 --> 20:47.162
I don't want your charity.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.122
Okay,

20:49.164 --> 20:51.708
I think
I misheard "thank you."

20:52.918 --> 20:54.711
I'm just trying to be a friend.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.298
From what I can tell,
you don't have friends.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.093
Oh, baby, my place is packed
with friends all the time.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.887
And nobody gets arrested.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.808
News flash. Those people

and maybe

21:14.231 --> 21:15.816

If you had a real friend,
they'd tell you that.

And maybe you wouldn't be
missing so many watches.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.413
Also, this is my notice.
I quit.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.665
Okay, you're overreacting.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.293

I'll tell you, I haven't
lost a game of spades

22:06.116 --> 22:08.535
in 20 years, and I'm not
losing one today.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.580

with the ace of spades

22:11.621 --> 22:13.040
in my back pocket.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.375

in church.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.547
Hmm.

And I play spades
with the wrath of hell.

(chuckles)
They wouldn't let me
back into church

22:25.093 --> 22:27.554

Uh...

22:27.596 --> 22:30.807
Are you okay playing spades
with someone like me?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.019

didn't respect

22:34.061 --> 22:36.480
my, uh, lifestyle.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.693
Well, I won't apologize for
believing in a higher power,

22:41.735 --> 22:45.572
but for those who
call themselves religious

22:45.614 --> 22:48.408
while using that word
to exclude others,

22:48.450 --> 22:52.371
to justify being transphobic...

22:52.412 --> 22:55.582
I believe those people are
missing the point of Jesus.

Uh, not anymore.
Didn't work out.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.932
I won Tom's watch
in a game of Spades, though.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.852
Tom is trash at spades.
Always has been.

33:40.893 --> 33:43.229
Why would he bet
you his watch?

33:46.649 --> 33:49.986
Because he knows I'll use it
to help a friend.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.739
And he knows
I won't take charity.

33:52.780 --> 33:56.451
Not many people can bring
out that side of Tom.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.577
Just saying.

33:57.618 --> 34:00.038
TOM:
Isaac.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.458
Stay with us.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.962
Stay with us.

34:08.004 --> 34:10.882
(door bursts open)
TOM:
Isaac.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.762
(Isaac gasps)

34:19.682 --> 34:22.143
I'm so happy that you...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.075
Welcome back.

34:37.617 --> 34:42.914
Um... I'm glad that
you're feeling better.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.296
I was wrong to fire you.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.299
I know you were only doing
what you felt was right,

34:53.341 --> 34:56.344
and after you came through
for Tom

34:56.385 --> 34:58.846
during his trial
yesterday,

34:58.888 --> 35:00.014
it just reminded me that
you're part of the family,

35:00.056 --> 35:02.809
so please stay.
Stay on with us.

35:03.810 --> 35:07.230
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.654
How you feeling?

35:14.695 --> 35:17.281
Honestly? I'm starving.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.491
(laughs)

35:18.533 --> 35:20.368
Let's get this soldier
some dinner.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.203
Yeah?

35:28.417 --> 35:31.379
So, uh, are we not gonna
talk about that moment
(device humming)

35:31.420 --> 35:33.881
you just had with Isaac?

35:33.923 --> 35:36.134
Talk about what?

35:37.760 --> 35:38.928
(device shuts off)

35:38.970 --> 35:41.055
Barclay, I just ran
a DNA test on my

35:41.097 --> 35:42.974
stopgap antidote to find out
why it worked

35:43.015 --> 35:45.560
so much better
than I expected.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.728
It looks like something
was added.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.314
I compared it to everything
in our database,

35:50.356 --> 35:52.525
and the new element...

35:52.567 --> 35:54.026
was Rowan's blood.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.195
BARCLAY:
Sorry, Tom, I have to
power down now

35:56.237 --> 35:57.530
due to an override command.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.658
Wh-What?!
No one overrides me.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.577
ISAAC:
Rowan.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.620
I saw him.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.790
While I was out, I-I had
these intense memories.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.959
The day I met Barton,
I-I saw Rowan.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.253
Watch out!

36:12.295 --> 36:13.546
(muttering in Swahili)

36:15.840 --> 36:17.675
ISAAC:
I don't know why he was there,

36:17.717 --> 36:19.594
but it wasn't a coincidence.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.095
How can you be sure
that it was Rowan?

36:21.137 --> 36:23.139
The medical scan showed
that the poison inflamed

36:23.181 --> 36:26.767
his hippocampus;
the brain's memory center.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.269
Maybe that heightened
your clarity.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.563
I'm just glad I remembered.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.023
We should thank
whoever poisoned me.

36:32.064 --> 36:35.234
Oh, my God.
I have a lead on that.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.445
Eskol gave me
this book today,

36:37.486 --> 36:39.238
and I took a picture
of his markings,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.824
and they spell out
the word "cotillion."

36:43.284 --> 36:45.953
Rowan said that The Road Back
tried to poison me.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.621
At the cotillion.

36:46.662 --> 36:50.666
While I was wearing
your face filter device.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.963
ISAAC:
Can you call up the surveillance
footage from the cotillion?

36:57.381 --> 37:00.051
TOM:
Stop. Next angle.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.931
I've seen that man before.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.437
I have, too.
He works for Eskol.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.358
And The Road Back.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.985
So we find this man,
then what?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.862
Then...

37:21.322 --> 37:23.991
...we get payback.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.087
I was able to slow down
Tom's efforts

37:36.128 --> 37:38.256
by causing a power outage
at Swift Manor,

37:38.297 --> 37:41.008
and we delayed his search
for the antidote chemicals.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.302
But we were still
not successful.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.222
Turns out it's for the best.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.432
While I was in the offices
today, I was able to hack

37:48.474 --> 37:49.976
into the main system.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.981
I learned that Tom is developing
a revolutionary neurotechnology.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.401
He'll be much more useful
to us alive.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.319
Right.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.197
I also learned...

38:03.239 --> 38:06.075
you've grown very fond
of your crush.

38:06.701 --> 38:10.705
So I engineered a little number
on the heating and lock system.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.212
Which proved to me
you'd be much more focused

38:18.254 --> 38:20.881
if Zenzi were out
of the picture entirely.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.135
No?

38:27.263 --> 38:28.556
(muffled cries)

38:28.597 --> 38:30.182
SUSANNAH:
It's the Swift's family doctor.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.270
I can provide
safe passage for Zenzi

38:34.312 --> 38:36.605
if you reaffirm your loyalty.

38:40.693 --> 38:44.071
Her life or his.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.242
(muffled pleading)

38:49.327 --> 38:51.704
Your choice.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.498
(pleading continues)

39:09.305 --> 39:11.432
(beeps)

39:15.436 --> 39:16.395
(doctor cries out)

39:16.437 --> 39:19.690
(pained groaning)

39:29.325 --> 39:31.202
Okay.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.455
We're good.
