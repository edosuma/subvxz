00:13.912 --> 00:16.533
Just got off a conference call
with NSA and Division.

00:16.623 --> 00:20.573
There's a nuclear bomb, under terrorist
control, somewhere in Los Angeles.

00:20.669 --> 00:22.827
It's set to go off at some point today.

00:23.839 --> 00:25.665
George, where are you going?

00:25.757 --> 00:27.501
- Bakersfield.
- Why?

00:27.592 --> 00:31.376
- I don't have to tell you.
- You're trying to get outside the blast radius.

00:31.471 --> 00:35.765
Sir, we have a serious situation.
Taking time out to coddle the media...

00:35.851 --> 00:42.897
Once the rumour mill starts, we've got two
problems. We don't need mass hysteria.

00:43.275 --> 00:45.813
My sister is getting married today, Ralph.

00:45.902 --> 00:50.695
We have to establish whether or not there's
a connection between Reza and the terrorists.

00:50.782 --> 00:53.273
A passport would be ideal.

00:54.953 --> 00:57.871
You'll be dropped
three blocks from the salvage yard.

00:57.956 --> 01:00.412
We haven't seen Wald come in yet.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.667
That's Eddie Grant,
one of Wald's main go-to guys.

01:03.753 --> 01:06.671
- You haven't changed much, Jack.
- What's your point?

01:06.756 --> 01:09.426
I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.

01:09.509 --> 01:10.754
What are we doing?

01:10.844 --> 01:14.427
Today we're turning a government building
into a cemetery.

01:14.514 --> 01:17.266
- What building?
- The CTU.

01:19.144 --> 01:22.762
Kim. Take my keys
and get her away from here.

01:23.982 --> 01:27.102
Kim, stop the car. I will kill you.

01:27.194 --> 01:29.981
Stop the car, Kim. Do not do this.

01:30.071 --> 01:34.899
I need you to come over here. Right here.
Wait for me. I'm gonna go get some help.

01:34.993 --> 01:37.235
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim.

01:40.415 --> 01:42.491
Megan? Megan?

01:43.084 --> 01:45.576
Megan! Megan!

01:54.096 --> 01:56.005
Megan!

01:56.098 --> 01:57.508
Megan!

01:57.599 --> 01:59.841
Megan! Megan!

01:59.935 --> 02:03.054
Have you seen a little girl? Nine, blonde hair?

02:07.067 --> 02:09.521
I'll be fine, OK? I'll be fine.

02:11.488 --> 02:13.196
You are Gary Matheson?

02:13.824 --> 02:14.986
Yeah.

02:15.075 --> 02:17.317
About time you got here. Where you been?

02:17.410 --> 02:19.902
We just got the call five minutes ago, sir.

02:19.996 --> 02:22.748
You're reporting a child abduction?

02:22.833 --> 02:25.999
It's my daughter. She took my daughter.

02:26.086 --> 02:28.078
Describe the suspect for me.

02:28.171 --> 02:30.793
I can do better than that. Her name is...

02:30.882 --> 02:32.839
Could you stop, please?

02:32.926 --> 02:35.084
Her name is Kimberly Bauer.

02:35.178 --> 02:39.128
- She works for my wife and me.
- I need a description, sir.

02:41.643 --> 02:44.514
- Mason.
- It's Tony. How far out of the city are you?

02:44.604 --> 02:45.553
Why?

02:45.647 --> 02:48.601
I just got off the line
with Steve Lawler from District.

02:48.692 --> 02:50.151
About what?

02:50.235 --> 02:53.271
LAPD made a vehicle match
with somebody on our watch list.

02:53.363 --> 02:57.740
- He wants you to check it out.
- This is coming out of LAPD? Come on.

02:57.826 --> 03:01.029
Lawler doesn't trust their judgment,
so he wants you there.

03:01.121 --> 03:03.991
Plus he knows it's on your way to Bakersfield.

03:04.082 --> 03:07.083
I know you're headed out there
to follow up on a lead,

03:07.169 --> 03:09.410
but Lawler wants this checked out.

03:09.504 --> 03:10.667
What's the address?

03:14.468 --> 03:17.005
Before you go to your press conference,

03:17.095 --> 03:21.556
Rayburn wanted me to give you
this updated damage projection.

03:24.853 --> 03:26.929
These casualty figures are higher.

03:27.022 --> 03:30.640
They have all but ruled out dirty bombs
and conventional weapons.

03:30.734 --> 03:34.945
They feel that we are actually
dealing with a nuclear bomb.

03:36.656 --> 03:38.234
Megan!

03:43.789 --> 03:46.161
Megan!

03:54.049 --> 03:55.460
Megan!

03:56.968 --> 03:59.886
Get away from her! Get away!

04:01.807 --> 04:04.594
Where did you go? I told you to wait.

04:04.684 --> 04:05.514
Huh?

04:05.602 --> 04:08.473
I was looking for you.

04:11.274 --> 04:13.350
Oh, God. OK, OK.

04:14.861 --> 04:16.937
I'm sorry.

04:17.738 --> 04:21.154
I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK.

04:38.718 --> 04:42.004
You're gonna take that building down
with three charges?

04:42.097 --> 04:44.136
It's all in the placement, Jack.

04:44.224 --> 04:47.344
- Did you guys spread those fuses?
- Yeah.

04:50.147 --> 04:52.353
What made you target CTU anyway?

04:52.441 --> 04:55.644
Why are you asking so many questions?

04:55.735 --> 05:01.110
- I just wanna know what I'm getting into.
- Nobody asked you to get into this.

05:01.199 --> 05:06.407
The time comes, all you gotta do is keep
your eyes open and we'll do the rest.

05:07.539 --> 05:09.828
Whatever you say, Eddie.

05:20.969 --> 05:23.045
- Yeah.
- Dad.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.386
- Did you get my message?
- Listen to me...

05:26.475 --> 05:32.180
- I left it on your phone about an hour ago.
- I lost my phone. Gary flipped out on me.

05:32.272 --> 05:33.683
Can you find it?

05:33.774 --> 05:36.062
- Find what?
- Your phone.

05:36.151 --> 05:41.145
I'm in trouble. I need you to come get me.
I can't go to the police with this.

05:43.074 --> 05:47.238
- Where are you?
- I'm at a payphone on Spring Street.

05:47.329 --> 05:52.156
- What's the number?
- Dad, I want you to come get me.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.576
I can't do that.

05:54.669 --> 05:56.911
Why not?

05:57.547 --> 06:00.252
Why don't you go to Carol's?
I'll call you there.

06:00.342 --> 06:02.500
- Aunt Carol's?
- Yeah.

06:02.594 --> 06:06.639
- She lives in San Jose, Dad.
- I know where she lives.

06:06.723 --> 06:09.475
Dad, you're acting really weird right now.

06:09.559 --> 06:12.679
Just go there.
And for once do what I ask, OK?

06:24.825 --> 06:27.742
- Who was that?
- My girlfriend.

06:27.828 --> 06:32.406
I asked her to pick something up for me.
She just doesn't listen.

06:42.259 --> 06:46.303
Tony, Jack Bauer's daughter on line five.
She sounds pretty freaked.

06:46.388 --> 06:50.682
- Kim, this is Tony. You all right?
- I just spoke to my dad. He's acting strange.

06:50.767 --> 06:53.721
- He pretty much hung up on me.
- He's on a job, Kim.

06:53.812 --> 06:56.979
Since when?
I just saw him a couple of hours ago.

06:57.065 --> 06:59.058
Maybe I can help you out.

06:59.151 --> 07:02.235
It's messed up. I have the police after me.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.270
- Why?
- I didn't do anything wrong. I've just been...

07:08.577 --> 07:11.246
Kim? Hello, Kim?

07:11.788 --> 07:13.117
Hello?

07:13.206 --> 07:16.622
Kim? The connection's messed up.

07:16.710 --> 07:19.248
Tell me where you are
and somebody'll pick you up.

07:19.337 --> 07:22.338
- I can't stay here.
- Can you find a way to CTU?

07:22.424 --> 07:25.674
Yeah, I guess so. I can take the bus.

07:25.761 --> 07:29.509
Do that. When you get here
I'll help you straighten everything out.

07:29.598 --> 07:31.590
OK.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.177
Come on.

07:33.268 --> 07:35.344
There's noise on all the phone lines.

07:35.437 --> 07:39.221
I tried a filter and I can't get rid of it.
It may not be our system.

07:39.316 --> 07:42.815
Today of all days.

07:42.903 --> 07:48.110
Call the phone company, and switch
all priority calls to wireless protocol.

07:53.121 --> 07:56.953
- You trying to knock out their phone lines?
- Don't bug me. I'm working.

07:57.042 --> 08:01.538
We're causing some interference
so the phone company sends out a crew.

08:01.630 --> 08:05.579
Maybe you could go out to the road, Jack.
Keep an eye out.

08:06.426 --> 08:08.917
Sure. No problem.

08:29.116 --> 08:34.357
- CTU operations. Go ahead.
- Hello? Is this CTU? Can you hear me?

08:34.453 --> 08:36.530
Hello? Damm it.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.045
- Northwest Regional.
- This is Jack Bauer from CTU.

08:48.135 --> 08:51.052
- I need to speak with the president.
- Who is this?

08:51.138 --> 08:57.176
It's Jack Bauer.
Priority access code 7117A. This is urgent.

08:57.269 --> 09:00.388
- Hold, please.
- Please don't put me on hold.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.813
- Lynne Kresge.
- I have a Jack Bauer for the president.

09:08.905 --> 09:13.069
- He has a clearance code.
- Put him through to me, please.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.074
- Mr. Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
- I need to speak with the president.

09:17.164 --> 09:20.912
I'm terribly sorry.
He's with the press corps right now.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.240
Mr. Bauer, hello?

09:23.336 --> 09:27.286
CTU's phone lines are down.
I need you to get them an urgent message.

09:27.382 --> 09:28.545
What is it?

09:28.633 --> 09:32.845
CTU, Los Angeles, is going to be blown up
within the hour. Wald's group is doing it.

09:32.929 --> 09:36.049
- Is this the nuclear bomb?
- No, it is not the nuke.

09:36.141 --> 09:39.391
But you need to evacuate CTU
and you need to alert a bomb squad.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.597
- There are at least three charges on the...
- Jack.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.728
All set, Jack.

09:50.697 --> 09:55.573
I applaud Governor Schulman's efforts
to protect Oregon's endangered species.

09:55.660 --> 10:00.287
His work with the Natural Resources Defense
Council has created a new paradigm...

10:00.373 --> 10:03.493
Wald's crew is planning
to blow up CTU, Los Angeles.

10:03.585 --> 10:07.334
It is a non-radiological attack,
and it is happening within the hour.

10:07.422 --> 10:10.127
- Where'd you get this?
- Jack Bauer.

10:12.969 --> 10:17.881
They wanna cripple CTU's investigation,
divert attention away from the major strike.

10:17.974 --> 10:21.675
- I agree.
- Has Bauer contacted CTU?

10:21.770 --> 10:24.557
He couldn't get through.
Phone lines are down.

10:24.648 --> 10:27.435
- Somehow we have to warn CTU.
- No, we don't.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.933
- We can't.
- What are you talking about?

10:30.028 --> 10:33.942
If Wald's crew fails,
they'll think somebody tipped off CTU.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.155
They'll figure out it was Bauer.

10:36.243 --> 10:39.861
Are you seriously suggesting
we just let these people at CTU die?

10:39.955 --> 10:43.739
- Jack Bauer gave specific instructions.
- Why isn't he stopping them?

10:43.834 --> 10:47.037
Because he knows
he's gotta keep his cover intact.

10:47.129 --> 10:52.040
He knows if he's exposed he can't get to Wald
and we lose our only chance to find the nuke.

10:52.134 --> 10:56.795
- This is the president's decision.
- He's telling the press it's business as usual.

10:56.888 --> 11:01.597
We've already detained Ron Wieland illegally.
We can't muzzle the entire press corps.

11:01.685 --> 11:07.059
- We still have to tell the president.
- We will. When he's in a position to hear it.

11:07.149 --> 11:11.442
- It will be too late by then.
- Lynne, this is my call.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.561
I don't work for you.

11:23.165 --> 11:26.664
- Jenny Dodge.
- It's Lynne. I need to speak to the president.

11:26.751 --> 11:30.334
- He's in a press conference.
- I don't care. This is urgent.

11:30.422 --> 11:34.122
- I want to speak with him now.
- OK. I'll try to get to him.

11:42.517 --> 11:44.593
Hey, look at this.

11:45.562 --> 11:47.851
Someone cut the chain.

11:47.939 --> 11:51.688
Get on the radio to Dispatch
and have them send security.

11:53.528 --> 11:55.770
Who are you?

11:59.159 --> 12:00.902
Don't move. Don't move!

12:00.994 --> 12:05.323
What's your name? What's your name?
Look at me. What's your name?

12:05.415 --> 12:07.740
- Cam Strocker. Is that your name?
- Yeah.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.752
Cam, look at me. You wanna live, Cam?

12:11.963 --> 12:13.837
Cam.

12:14.549 --> 12:18.298
- Cam. Cam. You wanna live?
- Yeah.

12:18.386 --> 12:21.174
This is what you're gonna do: call your boss,

12:21.264 --> 12:24.716
tell him you need an on-site systems check
at CTU headquarters.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.968
Got that?

12:27.062 --> 12:29.814
Can you do it? Can you do it?

12:30.607 --> 12:33.098
That's a good answer.

12:52.879 --> 12:55.370
It's Eric Rayburn from NSA.

12:57.801 --> 13:00.208
Mr. Rayburn? This is Tony Almeida.

13:00.303 --> 13:03.886
I understand you're the ranking agent on site.
Is that correct?

13:03.974 --> 13:07.639
- Yes, sir, it is.
- Then I need you to execute an order.

13:07.727 --> 13:08.723
Of course.

13:08.812 --> 13:12.395
I want you to copy and transfer
your database onto our server,

13:12.482 --> 13:15.602
anything related to the nuclear threat.

13:16.987 --> 13:22.229
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, sir, I did. May I ask why?

13:22.325 --> 13:26.240
It's precautionary, given
the extraordinary threat we're facing today.

13:26.329 --> 13:29.745
- But I would like it done sooner than later.
- How soon?

13:29.833 --> 13:31.031
By 11.

13:31.126 --> 13:34.162
The earliest I could get that done is by noon.

13:34.254 --> 13:38.003
- You have until 11.
- Sir, that may not be enough time.

13:38.091 --> 13:41.045
Then you probably should get started.

13:41.136 --> 13:43.212
Thank you, sir.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.633
- Paula.
- Yeah.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.845
- I need to pull you off your SIM analysis.
- I'm almost done.

13:49.936 --> 13:54.764
I want you to sort and send data to the NSA
server, everything relevant to the nuke, OK?

13:54.858 --> 13:57.978
- When do you need it done?
- Right now.

13:58.069 --> 14:00.857
I'm gonna have to generate
a fresh encryption code.

14:00.947 --> 14:05.942
- I'm gonna need to use Mr. Mason's office.
- Just do it, please. Thank you.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.750
Tony, what's going on?
First the phone lines go down

14:14.836 --> 14:18.751
and then NSA puts in a rush order
for us to transfer all our data on the nuke?

14:18.840 --> 14:22.174
He says it's precautionary.

14:22.260 --> 14:26.258
Then he would have issued
the same order to every other agency.

14:26.348 --> 14:28.839
- Look into that, would you?
- Yeah.

14:47.327 --> 14:50.613
How you doing? George Mason, CTU.

14:50.705 --> 14:56.210
Arroyo, LAPD. Barber made a vehicle match
from the alert you guys put out this morning.

14:56.294 --> 14:58.702
- Have you checked inside?
- We were about to.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.466
Our captain made us stand down
until you got here.

15:01.550 --> 15:05.417
Relax, Sergeant. I wanna be here
even less than you want me here.

15:50.223 --> 15:52.299
Hello?

16:18.835 --> 16:21.326
What's this?

16:44.569 --> 16:46.645
Nice.

17:05.132 --> 17:07.967
You OK in there?

17:08.050 --> 17:10.541
We got a man down in here.

17:14.391 --> 17:18.435
Get out of the building!
Get out of the building!

17:18.520 --> 17:22.103
Call Hazmat and have them
set up a quarantine.

17:22.190 --> 17:24.681
I think we got a hot zone.

17:55.390 --> 17:57.762
You OK?

17:57.851 --> 17:59.927
Yeah?

18:03.940 --> 18:06.431
Does your mom cry a lot?

18:07.402 --> 18:09.727
I don't have a mom.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.897
Where is she?

18:14.785 --> 18:16.861
She passed away.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.071
But you have a dad, right?

18:23.210 --> 18:25.286
Do you make him mad?

18:27.839 --> 18:30.081
Sometimes.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.880
I always make my dad mad.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.555
No, when your dad gets mad,
it's not because of you.

18:37.641 --> 18:40.807
- But he always says it is.
- Well, he's wrong.

18:40.894 --> 18:43.848
I promise you he's wrong.

18:46.858 --> 18:52.279
Everything's gonna be OK, Megan.
I'm never gonna let him hurt you again.

19:06.962 --> 19:09.453
You know the drill.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.211
How's it going?

19:14.302 --> 19:17.968
- I'm doing a system check and line repair.
- Let me see your work order.

19:18.056 --> 19:22.884
My office just called a few minutes ago.
They spoke with McKendrie.

19:22.978 --> 19:25.647
He says you got
some serious noise on your lines.

19:25.730 --> 19:28.222
- Let me see your ID.
- Sure.

19:37.451 --> 19:40.405
You're doing fine, Cam.

19:40.495 --> 19:42.571
Isn't he, Jack?

19:43.498 --> 19:45.989
Yeah, he's doing great.

19:55.343 --> 19:59.175
- Is the back open?
- It's just my crew back there.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.300
I still need to look.

20:02.392 --> 20:04.468
Go ahead. It's open.

20:23.371 --> 20:26.491
- There's a lot of you.
- It's a big job.

20:46.895 --> 20:49.303
It's all clear.

20:49.397 --> 20:54.474
All right. Go ahead.
Have your IDs ready for security up ahead.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.169
This isn't a bank.
There's nothing to steal here.

21:12.254 --> 21:15.290
- We're not stealing anything.
- Then why are we here?

21:15.382 --> 21:17.505
We're taking back our country.

21:17.592 --> 21:20.712
From who? Who are you people?

21:22.639 --> 21:25.130
Jack, tell him who we are.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.595
We're patriots.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.801
Kate, it's for you.
Some guy named Ralph Burton.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.964
Thanks.

22:05.056 --> 22:08.425
So who is he? A new boyfriend?

22:10.103 --> 22:11.384
Maybe.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.935
Why can't I ever get
a straight answer out of you?

22:15.025 --> 22:17.730
Can you just give me the phone?

22:21.364 --> 22:23.487
- Hello.
- Kate.

22:23.575 --> 22:27.407
Did you check
the passport information I gave you?

22:27.496 --> 22:32.490
I'm afraid it confirms that Reza Naiyeer
has had contact with Syed Ali.

22:34.753 --> 22:39.082
What does that mean?
Are you saying Reza's a terrorist?

22:39.174 --> 22:41.712
The authorities need to determine that.

22:41.802 --> 22:46.298
- Authorities? What authorities?
- I had to alert homeland security, Kate.

22:46.389 --> 22:48.465
Are they gonna arrest him?

22:48.558 --> 22:53.553
I'm not sure yet, but until I hear from them,
please keep this to yourself.

22:54.564 --> 22:56.308
I have to tell my sister.

22:56.399 --> 23:01.856
You can't tell her or anyone else about this
until you hear from me again.

23:01.947 --> 23:07.570
- I don't believe this is happening.
- I know it's hard, but just try to act normal.

23:07.661 --> 23:10.994
My sister is marrying someone
who works with terrorists

23:11.081 --> 23:13.833
and you expect me to act normal?

23:13.917 --> 23:19.540
You could endanger yourself and your family
if you let on that anything is wrong.

23:21.675 --> 23:23.584
Kate.

23:23.677 --> 23:26.512
Yeah. I understand.

23:53.081 --> 23:54.540
Kate.

23:54.624 --> 23:56.534
- Come with us.
- Not right now.

23:56.626 --> 24:01.169
My cousin Sanjar just arrived. We wanted you
to meet him before he headed to the hotel.

24:01.256 --> 24:04.542
- I can meet him later.
- You'll probably recognise him.

24:04.634 --> 24:07.635
- He was at Stanford the same time you were.
- He's cute.

24:07.721 --> 24:10.212
No, really. No! I said no!

24:25.864 --> 24:28.735
Kate, what is your problem?

24:28.825 --> 24:33.653
I'm sorry, Marie. I just...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

24:33.747 --> 24:37.163
What did you mean?
You've been acting really weird all morning.

24:37.250 --> 24:40.869
What is it, Kate? Tell me, what's going on?

24:45.967 --> 24:49.668
You're my little sister.
And I love you so much.

24:51.556 --> 24:55.720
And... I just want you to be happy.

24:55.811 --> 24:57.887
That's it.

25:00.357 --> 25:04.355
Well, then, be happy for me, OK?

25:04.444 --> 25:06.935
That'll make me happy.

25:07.030 --> 25:10.613
Because this is gonna be
the best day of my life.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.986
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:15.455 --> 25:18.741
- No crying.
- I'm sorry.

25:18.834 --> 25:22.582
- I'm getting married.
- I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:37.185 --> 25:38.679
- Jenny.
- Yes?

25:38.770 --> 25:41.261
I told you I need to speak to the president.

25:41.356 --> 25:44.357
I have to draft a statement
anticipating the nuclear event.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.064
- Why haven't I heard from him?
- He's on camera.

25:47.154 --> 25:51.317
I told you this was urgent.
You should have slipped him a note.

25:51.408 --> 25:56.864
I did. I'm sure as soon as the president
can extricate himself, he'll call you.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.883
Let's get those portable units in here now.

28:22.976 --> 28:25.645
Looks like this lead turned out to be real.

28:25.729 --> 28:28.564
Some kind of lab where
they may have assembled the nuke.

28:28.648 --> 28:31.899
- Based on what?
- They found radioactive material.

28:31.985 --> 28:34.690
What kind of radioactive material?

28:35.739 --> 28:38.823
They're still doing field analysis on it.

28:38.909 --> 28:41.316
Was anyone exposed?

28:41.411 --> 28:43.819
All of them in the bag.

28:43.914 --> 28:48.492
They're putting us through decon now.
Precautionary measure.

28:49.711 --> 28:54.254
We have three dead bodies. I'm gonna
send you photos and fingerprints on 'em.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.666
See if they match anybody on our watch list.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.963
- Your phone, sir.
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

29:00.055 --> 29:03.305
George, look,

29:03.391 --> 29:06.642
NSA ordered us to send them
our case database.

29:06.728 --> 29:11.686
Paula's already on it, but I sense they're
keeping us out of the loop on something.

29:11.775 --> 29:14.396
Standard procedure.
They're consolidating data from all agencies.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.570
That's just it.
We're the only agency they've asked.

29:17.656 --> 29:20.657
Sir, the phone.

29:20.742 --> 29:22.984
Tony, I gotta go. Call Chapelle.

29:23.078 --> 29:26.910
Tell him what you just told me.
See what he can find out for you. I gotta go.

29:26.998 --> 29:31.079
- George, you sure you're OK?
- I'm fine.

29:34.131 --> 29:37.582
I need all your clothes off.

29:37.676 --> 29:40.593
You're not even gonna buy me dinner?

29:47.310 --> 29:49.386
Check him over at hoses.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.451
Easy, guys. I like my skin.
Try and leave some on.

30:20.135 --> 30:23.005
Did you finish exporting
those files to Division?

30:23.096 --> 30:28.932
No, it's in process now. As soon as they
finish uploading, I'll send an encryption key.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.811
Paula, are you all right?

30:42.115 --> 30:44.571
Yeah.

30:44.659 --> 30:49.701
I was a little nervous before, but Tony said
everything's probably gonna be OK.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.293
I grew up in LA, you know.

31:00.842 --> 31:04.176
My whole family is here,
my friends are here.

31:04.262 --> 31:09.601
So if this bomb goes off, that just means
all of a sudden everyone's gonna die?

31:09.684 --> 31:12.804
No. No, not necessarily.

31:13.522 --> 31:15.810
It depends on a lot of things.

31:15.899 --> 31:18.770
Yeah, that's probably right.

31:18.860 --> 31:22.063
Well, I should check the upgrade.

31:23.740 --> 31:25.899
Paula.

31:25.992 --> 31:28.697
Are you gonna be OK?

31:28.787 --> 31:33.947
I guess so. I'm really scared, but
there's nothing I can do about it, right?

31:36.086 --> 31:38.162
It's fine, Michelle.

32:50.744 --> 32:53.994
- You gonna kill me too?
- Not today.

32:55.999 --> 32:59.415
Just relax. Just relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

32:59.503 --> 33:02.706
I'm trying to stop this thing.
I need your help.

33:02.798 --> 33:07.506
Two cars over there's a large grey SUV. I want
you to hide under it and wait until we go.

33:07.594 --> 33:11.544
After we've gone, I want you
to take this back into the building.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.391
Go to security, ask for Tony Almeida.

33:14.476 --> 33:19.850
It'll show him where all the bombs
are located. He'll know what to do. Now go.

33:19.940 --> 33:22.265
What are you talking about, man?
Who are you?

33:22.359 --> 33:24.565
I'm a government agent. I'm undercover.

33:24.653 --> 33:28.235
You work for the government?
And you let them kill Danny?

33:28.323 --> 33:32.072
- It happened before I could stop it.
- You son of a bitch!

33:33.161 --> 33:36.281
Listen to me. Listen to me.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.288
I'm sorry about your friend. I am.

33:40.377 --> 33:46.130
But we are in a very serious situation, so you
better get your ass under that car right now.

33:46.216 --> 33:50.130
These guys'll be back in a minute.
If you're still here they will kill you.

33:50.220 --> 33:53.671
I won't be able to stop them.
Do you understand?

33:57.352 --> 34:00.519
The lives of everyone in this building
are at stake right now.

34:00.605 --> 34:04.354
So, please, get that message
to Tony Almeida.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.520
Come on, go.

34:24.379 --> 34:26.870
Where's your boy, Eddie?

34:34.848 --> 34:37.219
Jack? Jack?

34:38.101 --> 34:39.975
Jack.

34:41.897 --> 34:44.054
What happened? Where's the guy?

34:44.149 --> 34:46.225
Look at me. Jack.

34:47.402 --> 34:50.853
What happened?
Jack, look at me. What happened?

34:50.947 --> 34:54.197
- I don't know.
- Where's the telephone guy?

34:54.284 --> 34:58.412
I don't know. I was looking out
like you asked me to,

34:58.497 --> 35:01.912
and the next thing I know
you're slapping me in the head, Eddie.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.914
What are you telling me, Jack?
Are you saying you let the son of a bitch go?

35:06.004 --> 35:09.539
- I didn't tie him up.
- Are you saying it's my fault?

35:09.633 --> 35:14.758
Do you believe this guy? He walks in
off the street, breaks Dave's ankle...

35:15.180 --> 35:17.552
Back off! Back off.

35:17.641 --> 35:20.310
Shut up. Jack, get in the front of the van.

35:21.061 --> 35:26.138
Get in the front of the van. We got seven
minutes until this building goes down. Get in.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.487
Hi.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.779
My name's Kimberly Bauer.
Tony Almeida is expecting us.

36:20.871 --> 36:22.947
OK. He'll take care of you.

36:26.376 --> 36:29.496
- Where are we?
- Don't worry. We're safe here.

36:56.031 --> 36:58.736
- How much time have we got?
- Four minutes.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.363
Unless the phone guy
already pulled the alarm.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.529
Leave it alone.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.746
The press conference ended five minutes ago.

37:11.838 --> 37:16.500
The president was supposed to call me
the minute, very minute that he...

37:22.641 --> 37:24.847
What are you doing?

37:24.935 --> 37:28.185
It was you. You told Jenny
to keep the president away from me.

37:28.271 --> 37:31.142
I spared the president
from a no-win situation.

37:31.233 --> 37:34.352
The people did not elect you
to make that choice, Eric.

37:34.444 --> 37:37.196
- It's too late.
- Maybe not.

37:40.242 --> 37:43.077
- Get out of my way.
- Don't do this, Lynne.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.652
You do not want me for an enemy, I promise.

37:45.747 --> 37:49.911
- Are you threatening me?
- Just giving you some strong advice.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.912
What's going on?

37:55.715 --> 38:01.552
Jack Bauer called. He said that
Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU.

38:01.638 --> 38:05.885
It's a non-nuclear strike,
which suggests that it's a secondary target.

38:05.976 --> 38:08.727
- When?
- We're not sure. Bauer got cut off.

38:08.812 --> 38:11.350
- Have you called CTU?
- That's what we were debating.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.554
Debating?

38:12.649 --> 38:18.569
Right now Wald is our only thread to finding
the nuke. But Bauer hasn't got to Wald yet.

38:18.655 --> 38:23.068
If we stop Wald's crew, they may realise
it was Bauer that turned them in.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.030
In the meantime,
I'm having CTU transfer their intel

38:26.121 --> 38:30.664
so our only losses would be
infrastructure and personnel.

38:30.750 --> 38:34.001
Those losses are unacceptable.
Contact CTU immediately.

38:34.087 --> 38:36.163
Yes, sir.

38:40.844 --> 38:44.889
- Think I'm making a mistake?
- I do, sir.

38:54.775 --> 38:58.689
Tony. That guy over there,
he's asking to see you.

38:58.779 --> 39:02.112
He claims he was taken hostage
by these men that wanna blow up CTU.

39:02.199 --> 39:06.825
He said there are bombs planted here,
here and here. I'll have a squad check it out.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.821
- Order an evacuation.
- We don't know...

39:08.914 --> 39:12.448
This is why NSA wanted us
to transfer over our database.

39:12.542 --> 39:17.584
They knew we were being targeted and
didn't say a thing. We have to evacuate now.

39:17.672 --> 39:19.380
Everyone, listen up.

39:19.466 --> 39:25.089
This is Lynne Kresge. I'm calling
to tell you about a possible threat to CTU.

39:25.180 --> 39:28.964
We just found out about it.
NSA knew about this a half an hour ago.

39:29.059 --> 39:32.724
- That's why Rayburn wanted our files.
- Right now get your people out.

39:32.813 --> 39:37.521
I want you to go down this hallway
and calmly clear everyone out.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.156
- What's going on?
- We're evacuating.

39:48.245 --> 39:52.289
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida.
- I'm sorry. We've gotta go right now.

40:05.429 --> 40:07.505
35 seconds.

40:16.523 --> 40:20.355
I need you to move a little faster.

40:21.153 --> 40:24.652
No, leave your things behind!

40:31.538 --> 40:34.539
- What are you doing?
- I'm almost done with the encryption.

40:34.624 --> 40:37.329
- Leave it! There's a bomb!
- We can't lose this data!

40:37.419 --> 40:40.336
Would you leave it? Come on!

40:44.092 --> 40:46.464
Let's go! Come on, hurry! Hurry!

41:13.747 --> 41:18.041
- We did it, Jack.
- Good job, Eddie. Good job.

41:43.568 --> 41:46.902
We're too late. CTU was just hit.

41:56.665 --> 41:59.156
- I want Mommy.
- I know.

42:05.465 --> 42:07.541
It's OK.

42:11.221 --> 42:13.842
You're clean.

42:13.932 --> 42:16.423
Then why so grim?

42:17.227 --> 42:19.848
The tests are back from the field analysis.

42:19.938 --> 42:23.473
The substance you inhaled is...
well, it's plutonium.

42:23.567 --> 42:29.605
Based on the particle size, atmospheric
