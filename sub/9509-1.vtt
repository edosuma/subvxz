00:01.069 --> 00:04.038
(piano playing
"As Time Goes By")

00:04.038 --> 00:06.707
(orchestra joins in,
music swells)

00:09.377 --> 00:12.480
(song concludes
with a flourish)

00:13.981 --> 00:17.185
(eerie tones playing)

00:28.496 --> 00:30.698
(low, ominous tone plays)

00:36.204 --> 00:38.772
(thunder rumbling)

00:38.772 --> 00:42.176
(acoustic guitar playing
upbeat intro)

00:44.678 --> 00:46.947
(thunder crashes)

00:46.947 --> 00:49.617
(horse neighs)

00:49.617 --> 00:52.120
(wind whistles)

00:53.254 --> 00:56.257
(waterfall rumbling,
stream flowing)

00:56.257 --> 00:59.560

01:05.733 --> 01:08.402

01:19.147 --> 01:20.481
(sneezes)

01:20.481 --> 01:22.483
(church bell tolling)

01:26.587 --> 01:27.955
(doors creak)

01:27.955 --> 01:28.922
Who are you?!

01:28.922 --> 01:30.090
(chuckles)

01:30.090 --> 01:31.792
Hello. I'm Nancy Drew.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.194
It's nice to meet you.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.396
May I ask who you are?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.998
Guess.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.500
All right.
I'm guessing you two

01:39.500 --> 01:41.101
are working
with Lawrence McNabb,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.970
the locksmith,
that he gives you the keys

01:42.970 --> 01:45.639
and you're responsible for
the recent string of burglaries.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.707
However,

01:46.707 --> 01:48.609
you should know
the DA's only interested

01:48.609 --> 01:51.279
in McNabb-- you two
could make a deal with him.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.846
And that
Charlie the security guard

01:52.846 --> 01:55.816
is about to walk
through that door.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.152
(door creaks open)

01:58.152 --> 02:00.954
(door creaking closed)
(meekly): Hi.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.158
(sirens wailing)

02:08.596 --> 02:10.431
Listen to me.
I'll get Pastor Murray

02:10.431 --> 02:11.765
to drop the
breaking-and-entering charges

02:11.765 --> 02:13.767
if you agree
to some kind of counseling.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.703
(sighs):
Anger issues don't just go away.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.772
I don't need a shrink!
(whispers): Yeah, you do.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.741
He gets cranky
when he hasn't eaten.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.576
I told him, you know,
go have a snack.

02:22.576 --> 02:26.280
I said, "Before we get here,
you better have a snack."

02:26.280 --> 02:28.349
Oh, one summer,
we were on Fire Island...

02:28.349 --> 02:30.318
Hey! Psst!
Not with that story again!

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819
(sirens wail in distance)

02:31.819 --> 02:34.188
Hold on.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.356
What's that?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.024
My sleuth kit.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.459
Flashlight,

02:38.459 --> 02:39.760
fountain pen, notebook,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.162
magnifying glass,
fingerprint powder,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.632
digital recorder and...

02:47.901 --> 02:50.271
...one of Hannah's lemon bars.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.408
(tires screech, siren stops)

02:54.408 --> 02:57.811
(garbled police radio
transmissions)

02:57.811 --> 02:59.613
Bess, is Nancy okay?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.482
Are you kidding?
She's loving it.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.951
Okay, here he is.
Nancy?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.486
(laughs):
Hi, Ned.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.321
So, I had this dream
during my nap today

03:07.321 --> 03:08.589
where you went off to California

03:08.589 --> 03:09.990
and met that guy on Smallville,

03:09.990 --> 03:12.860
and you got amnesia and...

03:12.860 --> 03:14.462
literally forgot
you ever met me,

03:14.462 --> 03:16.297
and then I turned
into a squirrel.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.766
Anyway, what do you think
that means?

03:18.766 --> 03:21.502
(groans): Um, Ned, can we
talk about this later?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.437
I'm just a little busy.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.972
Yeah, sorry.

03:24.972 --> 03:25.973
O-Okay.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.241
Not appropriate, Ned.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.410
You take naps?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.011
What's going on?
Is she okay?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.781
Hey, now, don't worry,
I just talked with her--

03:33.781 --> 03:34.648
she's doing fine.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.183
That Nancy's my best man.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.585
I-I mean,

03:37.585 --> 03:40.588
she would be if she
were on the force.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.059
Fine. Therapy.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.296
Great. I'll call
the D.A. back.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.830
(laughs)

03:51.399 --> 03:54.968
(sighs): I just want
to thank you, Nancy Drew.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.605
I've always heard the
nicest things about you,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.873
the way you solve mysteries
and you help people...

03:59.873 --> 04:01.008
Steve...

04:01.008 --> 04:03.010
please don't thank her
for turning us in.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.046
I think Crankenstein needs
another lemon bar.

04:06.046 --> 04:10.551
Well, I thought the
Crankosaurus was extinct.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.686
I don't know about this.
Well, I'm sorry,

04:12.686 --> 04:15.756
Cranky Doodle Dandy.
(laughs)

04:15.756 --> 04:17.491
I can't do this.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.026
Gary, we made a deal.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.728
The deal's gone wrong.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.163
Hey, where is she?
We need her!

04:23.163 --> 04:25.566
You take that side.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.001
(ominous, jazzy theme plays)

04:31.805 --> 04:33.607
(low scratching)

04:40.448 --> 04:42.483
* *

04:42.483 --> 04:44.885
(quiet grunting)

04:44.885 --> 04:46.820
Hey, Gary, look.

04:47.655 --> 04:52.893
Hey! Let's get out of here.

04:52.893 --> 04:53.961
It's Nancy!

04:53.961 --> 04:56.630
(excited chatter)
WOMAN: It's Nancy!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.901
Hi, everybody.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.640
Hold it there!
Hold it right there!

05:10.110 --> 05:11.545
(gasps)

05:11.545 --> 05:14.582
(crowd gasps, woman screams)

05:14.582 --> 05:18.185
WOMAN:
Oh, my goodness!

05:18.185 --> 05:20.588
(crowd gasps)
MAN: Hold on!

05:20.588 --> 05:22.856
MAN:
Hold on to that gutter!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.958
YOUNG WOMAN:
Come on, Nancy, hold on tight!

05:24.958 --> 05:28.228
Hold on, Nancy--
we got the fire department here!

05:28.228 --> 05:30.998
That's all right, Chief--
I'll be down in a jiffy.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.734
Hang on, Nancy!

05:42.376 --> 05:46.213
* *

05:46.213 --> 05:48.882
(people cheering))

05:48.882 --> 05:50.751
(laughing)

05:50.751 --> 05:53.921
Yay!
Yay, Nancy!

05:53.921 --> 05:55.523
Are you okay?

05:55.523 --> 05:56.757
I'm fine, Dad.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.091
Really, in the
sleuthing business,

05:58.091 --> 05:59.793
this kind of thing
happens all the time.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.529
It really isn't
a big deal.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.064
It is a big deal.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.699
I ran from the courthouse

06:05.699 --> 06:07.968
in the middle
of that eviction case,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.270
which the judge, he...

06:10.270 --> 06:12.339
he didn't appreciate.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.641
Where is your car?

06:13.641 --> 06:17.077
Around the corner.
(sighs)

06:18.278 --> 06:19.480
(sighs)

06:19.480 --> 06:21.515
Is now a better time?

06:21.515 --> 06:23.717
'Cause I wanted
to give you this.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
Wha...
You know, your hunch

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
was right on
the nose, Nancy.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.191
Just wish you could've clued
us in a little earlier.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.426
Nancy! Nancy!
Thank God!

06:32.426 --> 06:33.461
Nancy, right here.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.828
Hi, Nancy.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.397
(laughter)
Smile!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.732
Thank you.
Bye.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.034
Nancy, what are we
gonna do without you?

06:41.034 --> 06:43.504
It's only for a few
months-- I'll be back.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.638
The image of
your mother.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.773
Do you remember
her at all?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.742
No.
She was such a lovely woman,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.579
so kind and intelligent.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.114
Just like you, Nancy.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.817
(honks horn twice)

06:56.817 --> 06:58.519
Bye, everybody.
Bye-bye.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.853
So long, Nancy!

07:05.058 --> 07:08.862
Shall we all pray for her
safe journey to California?

07:08.862 --> 07:09.997
Sure.

07:09.997 --> 07:13.000
Dear Lord, please
watch over Nancy Drew

07:13.000 --> 07:16.770
and protect her as she
strives to solve mysteries

07:16.770 --> 07:21.509
that are beyond the abilities of
local law enforcement agencies.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.877
(birds chirping)

07:23.877 --> 07:25.078
(sighs)

07:25.078 --> 07:27.314
Dad, I...
I want you to promise--

07:27.314 --> 07:29.717
no more sleuthing, at least
while we're in California.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.786
You go to school,
shopping,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.254
spend some time
with teenagers.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.256
It's what you're
supposed to be doing.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.458
Give it a try.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.529
(birds chirping)

07:43.363 --> 07:45.165
(turns engine off)

07:45.165 --> 07:47.501
You know, I've always picked
cases that help people.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.336
"Others first."
That's right.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.639
But this one... this
is a little different.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.006
If everything goes well,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.676
I could start making
some... real money.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.845
We have enough money, Dad.
Well, I'll be the judge

07:57.845 --> 07:59.479
of that, thank you.
At any rate,

07:59.479 --> 08:03.250
I'm starting something new--
I-I can't be worried about...

08:03.250 --> 08:05.819
(phone rings, Dad groans)

08:07.387 --> 08:09.222
How you doing, John?

08:09.222 --> 08:11.491
Yeah, I'll meet you
at the deposition

08:11.491 --> 08:13.594
as soon as my
train gets in.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.795
(Nancy sighs)

08:14.795 --> 08:16.429
Well, we don't have
an airport out here.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.765
I wish I was kidding.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.634
This is a terrible
development!

08:20.634 --> 08:22.002
What are you gonna do?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.572
You have a mystery to
solve in La-La Land.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.874
I'll figure something out.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.208
(sighs)

08:28.208 --> 08:29.877
I hope.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.849
Ned!

08:35.849 --> 08:40.520
With all the commotion,
I didn't get to give you this.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.325
I needed a new compass.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.227
The old one's wobbly.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.696
Thank you.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.031
In case I'm not with
you on your birthday.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.966
That's so sweet.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.436
I just don't know
if I'll get to use it.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.572
Why?
Well, my dad

08:58.572 --> 09:01.141
let me choose the house
we're gonna live in,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.342
so I chose one with...

09:02.342 --> 09:04.578
With a mystery.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.913
But not just any mystery.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.415
One of the greatest
unsolved cases of all time--

09:08.415 --> 09:09.850
Dehlia Draycott.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.153
The movie actress.
Mm-hmm?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.755
Before your time.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.856
25 years ago,

09:15.856 --> 09:19.026
at the height of her fame,

09:19.026 --> 09:21.762
she disappeared
for five months.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.064
Nobody knew where.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.935
And when she came back,
she threw a giant party.

09:27.935 --> 09:32.272
But she never went downstairs
to greet her guests.

09:32.272 --> 09:37.444
She was found floating
in the pool... dead.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.112
Gee, that sounds
like fun.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.049
I know, right? But I didn't
tell my dad about the house,

09:42.049 --> 09:44.151
and now he's not letting me
do any sleuthing.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.986
I mean, there was
a hostage situation,

09:45.986 --> 09:48.455
so I can kind of see
his point, but, um...

09:48.455 --> 09:50.123
DAD:
Hi, Ned. Bye, Ned.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.491
Got to scoot, Nancy.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.693
Mr. Drew!

09:52.693 --> 09:55.195
Some Pfeffernusse, just in case.
Oh.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.264
And some ginger cupcakes--
your favorite.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.166
You're gonna get hungry
on the train...

09:59.166 --> 10:01.468
GIRL: Nancy! Nancy! Hold on!
Thank you so much.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.836
Bye, guys.
Nancy!

10:02.836 --> 10:04.872
(crying): Bye, Nancy.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.675
Now, you're gonna have
a safe train ride, okay?

10:07.675 --> 10:09.042
I'll miss you.
Don't get hurt.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.144
And please, you have
to keep us in contact.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.915
Um, Ned, don't worry about
that guy from Smallville.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.617
He's not my type.
DAD: Nancy?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.353
You have a type?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.589
(bright rock melody playing)

10:22.589 --> 10:24.191
Chief McGinnis!

10:24.191 --> 10:27.761
I just want to let you know that
I'm not sleuthing anymore. Bye!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.964
Nancy Drew not
sleuthing anymore?

10:30.964 --> 10:34.467
(chuckles):
I don't think so.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.171
(train whistle blows)

10:42.843 --> 10:44.812
* Come to California *

10:44.812 --> 10:48.682
* Baby, let it all hang out *

10:50.784 --> 10:52.786
* Come to California *

10:52.786 --> 10:56.156
* Tell us what it's all about *

10:57.958 --> 11:01.328
* But watch your mind
little bit, 'cause the future *

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
* Is beginning *

11:03.330 --> 11:06.133
* Now, now *

11:06.133 --> 11:08.068
* Flew in to L.A. *

11:08.068 --> 11:11.204
* Caught a screening
of your lifelong dream *

11:11.204 --> 11:14.441
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A. system)

11:14.441 --> 11:15.976
* Blew it in L.A. *

11:15.976 --> 11:19.847
* Now you're desperate
to create your own scene *

11:21.248 --> 11:23.550
Oh!
* Watch your mind little bit *

11:23.550 --> 11:27.087
* 'Cause you're headed
into the machine *

11:29.389 --> 11:30.758
* Come to California *

11:30.758 --> 11:32.726
* Come to California *

11:32.726 --> 11:34.627
* Come to California *

11:34.627 --> 11:36.696
* Come to California *

11:36.696 --> 11:38.866
* Come to California *

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
* Never want to go away *

11:40.868 --> 11:42.602
* Come to California *

11:42.602 --> 11:44.938
* Come to California *

11:44.938 --> 11:47.574
* And watch your mind
little bit *

11:47.574 --> 11:49.810
* 'Cause you're headed
into the machine... *

11:51.511 --> 11:54.247
Hi. This is Carson Drew--
I'm running a little late.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.217
Hey, Dad, don't you think
people who talk on cell phones,

11:57.217 --> 11:58.451
uh, miss things?
Like what?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.353
Like that woman in the street.
(grunts)

12:00.353 --> 12:01.721
(tires screech)
WOMAN (laughs): Oh!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.791
(grunts)

12:03.791 --> 12:06.726
WOMAN:
Uh, uh, Mr. Drew? Nancy?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.261
Yes.

12:08.261 --> 12:11.031
(laughs): Hi. Thank you so much
for not running me over.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.901
I'm Barbara Barbara,
of Barbara Barbara Realty.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.969
You're here.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.505
Oh, I'm gonna get
right out of your way.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.744
(gates rattling)

12:30.784 --> 12:32.986
How do you love it?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.493
Oh! Gorgeous!

12:40.493 --> 12:41.929
(gasps)

12:41.929 --> 12:44.031
(door creaks)
Welcome.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.973
It's not exactly
what I had in mind,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.008
especially given the price.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.444
BARBARA (chuckles):
Well, as I told your daughter

12:57.444 --> 13:00.347
on the phone,
you do pay a premium for m...

13:00.347 --> 13:02.950
(closes piano)
Oh, I am such an oaf.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.086
Um, as you were saying,
you pay a premium for history,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.155
architectural significance.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.257
I mean, Dad,
look at this woodwork.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.926
Yeah, what-what she said.
Who's this?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.495
Dehlia Draycott,
the great film legend.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.763
This was her home.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.731
Didn't your
daughter tell you?

13:18.731 --> 13:22.870
We've, uh, both
been somewhat busy.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.605
(phone ringing)
Oh, excuse me.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.041
Yeah, hello?

13:28.708 --> 13:30.177
Do you know what?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.579
With a little tweaking,
you could be adorable.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.714
Um, thank you?

13:34.714 --> 13:36.950
Yes, you're just a makeover
waiting to happen.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.552
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.555
Oh, come on, let's go
upstairs-- I can't wait

13:42.555 --> 13:44.691
to show you.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.227
Did you hear something?

13:49.129 --> 13:51.598
I suddenly got a chill.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.037
(brooding, mysterious
theme playing)

14:02.742 --> 14:06.013
Have a look around if you want.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.084
(gasps)

14:11.084 --> 14:13.120
Don't be afraid.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.223
Please, don't be afraid of me.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.161
I'm here to help you.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.831
You don't understand.
I want to... I want to help you.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.866
(frightened gasps)

14:26.866 --> 14:29.569
(laughing)

14:29.569 --> 14:31.671
I love that.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.774
They fall for it
every time.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.043
That's the projector.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.745
Oh, it's from one
of her old movies.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.381
There are so many booby traps
all over this house.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.484
People get so scared sometimes,
they wet their pants.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.485
(laughing)

14:45.485 --> 14:47.887
(chuckles):
Where's the gift shop?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.957
That's the spirit.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.925
Look, Miss Barbara Barbara,
I know I called

14:51.925 --> 14:53.826
asking for a house
with a mystery,

14:53.826 --> 14:55.862
but, um, things have changed,

14:55.862 --> 14:57.597
and... it's complicated,

14:57.597 --> 15:00.333
but... we're gonna need
a different house.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.370
Honey cheeks, read
the fine print:

15:03.370 --> 15:05.238
no refunds,
no exchanges.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.475
And besides, you know, there's
nothing else available...

15:08.475 --> 15:10.877
in your price range.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.680
(brief chuckle)

15:15.848 --> 15:17.017
I'm just gonna
use the gents,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.518
then I have to run
to that deposition.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.887
Watch this.
(ghostly shrieking)

15:20.887 --> 15:22.889
(Dad gasping, yelling)

15:22.889 --> 15:24.891
(panting)

15:24.891 --> 15:27.594
(laughing)

15:27.594 --> 15:29.229
Something just happened
in the bathroom

15:29.229 --> 15:32.132
which I am at a loss
to explain.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.701
(chuckles): The house
has a haunted theme.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.236
It's like a theme park.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.971
It's so fun, right, Dad?

15:37.971 --> 15:39.706
No.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.544
BARBARA: Oh, did I mention?
There's a strange caretaker.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.180
He lives in an apartment
down the hill.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.681
Uh, what's your name?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.384
Leshing. Let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.721
Nancy Drew.
Thank you very much.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.223
Uh, Leshing,

15:56.223 --> 15:59.726
we need to talk
about the lawn.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.329
* *

16:02.329 --> 16:04.964
(crickets chirping)

16:06.033 --> 16:08.968
(distant creaking echoes)

16:08.968 --> 16:11.004
Mm.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.444
Dad?

16:17.444 --> 16:19.312
M-Mr. Leshing?

16:19.312 --> 16:22.349
(distant creaking echoes)

16:23.883 --> 16:25.485
Hmm.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.727
(distant thud)

16:34.727 --> 16:37.730
(chandelier tinkling)

16:37.730 --> 16:39.766
(creaking)

16:41.201 --> 16:43.903
(distant thud)

16:43.903 --> 16:48.075
Someone stole my moccasins
and an important folder.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.277
Mysteries just find
you, don't they?

16:50.277 --> 16:53.213
I'm letting the professionals
handle this one.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.581
I'm on hold with the LAPD.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.585
Oh, calling the police
to solve a crime.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.986
I like it.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.488
It's been 57 minutes.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.191
They must be having
a busy night.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.693
(door creaks)

17:06.693 --> 17:10.130
(snoring)

17:10.130 --> 17:12.598
Yes. I'd like to
report a theft.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.101
I'm sorry!

17:14.101 --> 17:15.602
A favorite pair of
moccasin slippers

17:15.602 --> 17:17.470
and a Pee Chee folder
have been stolen.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.038
Please send an officer over
immediately.

17:19.038 --> 17:23.242
(man on phone laughing)

17:24.977 --> 17:26.512
(beep)

17:26.512 --> 17:29.216
Someone must have told a joke
over at the precinct.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.285
Yeah. That's it.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.121
Because it would be
irresponsible

17:34.121 --> 17:37.290
for a police department
to laugh at a crime.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.327
You're right.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.529
(quietly):
Yeah.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.002
(crickets chirping
outside)

17:50.002 --> 17:52.004
(distant creaking echoes)

17:52.004 --> 17:54.107
Dad?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.951
(phone rings in distance)

18:04.951 --> 18:06.386
Hello?
Leshing, this is Nancy.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.288
I needed to prove
your whereabouts.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.390
Go back to sleep.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.226
(door closes in distance)

18:13.226 --> 18:14.861
(distant footsteps)

18:25.472 --> 18:27.574
Someone's in the house.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.210
How did you get
here so quickly?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.711
If you're accusing me...

18:31.711 --> 18:32.945
(creaking)

18:32.945 --> 18:34.747
The attic.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.724
(creaking)

18:52.899 --> 18:54.867
(footsteps approaching)

18:56.068 --> 18:59.539
How is it possible for
someone to be in the attic

18:59.539 --> 19:02.141
and escape while we're
coming up the stairs?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.976
Is there another
staircase?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.346
No.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.715
Do you believe in ghosts,
Mr. Leshing?

19:08.715 --> 19:11.184
I am a ghost.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.385
(footsteps approaching)

19:12.385 --> 19:14.721
The Four Seasons
isn't haunted.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.122
What do you say?

19:16.122 --> 19:18.491
Dad, you hate hotels.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.927
Spa treatments...

19:20.927 --> 19:22.595
room service...

19:22.595 --> 19:25.832
These books
must have been Dehlia's.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.867
May I borrow some?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.001
If it were up to me,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.137
I wouldn't let anybody
in the house, period,

19:31.137 --> 19:32.372
but you're paying the rent,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.274
so do what you want.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.642
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

19:35.642 --> 19:37.410
Good night.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.818
I like him.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.954
So...

19:47.954 --> 19:50.757
turns out there's
a mystery here after all.

19:50.757 --> 19:54.227
Dad, that mystery stuff
is so boring to me now.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.928
I've completely moved on.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.163
Mm-hmm.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.398
It was really
just a phase, you know,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.400
like papier-mache or puppets.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.236
It's over, done,
finished, gone forever.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.572
Got it.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.943
(sighs)

20:14.113 --> 20:16.182
WOMAN:
"Z... I'm sorry

20:16.182 --> 20:18.385
"to have vanished like I did.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.787
"I know you have been
looking for me.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.889
"Something important
happened last week.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.658
"I can't be the Dehlia
I was anymore.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.694
"I'm writing a new will.

20:27.694 --> 20:32.064
I need to make provisions
for someone else. D."

20:32.064 --> 20:35.335
D is Dehlia, but who's Z?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.704
Who's the someone else?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.006
No.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.641
I'm not sleuthing.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.075
(chuckles):
No, sirree.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.878
You're just reading a letter
that happens to be

20:45.878 --> 20:48.381
a major clue in
a fantastically famous mystery.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.483
But that means nothing to you.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.752
You're gonna go to bed
and be reasonable, Nancy.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.654
You're going
to a new school tomorrow.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.356
You're gonna make
wonderful friends.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.024
You're a normal teenager.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.859
You really are.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.694
Yeah.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.998
(exhales)

21:05.998 --> 21:08.935
(crickets chirping)

21:08.935 --> 21:10.370
(exhales)

21:10.370 --> 21:12.705
(birds chirping)

21:16.509 --> 21:19.211
(alarm rings)

21:19.211 --> 21:21.881
(pop intro plays)

21:26.519 --> 21:28.020
* Let me ask you, boy *

21:28.020 --> 21:30.690
* Do you think
that I'm pretty? *

21:30.690 --> 21:35.495
* Will it be forever,
or will you up and leave? *

21:35.495 --> 21:37.464
* You're pretty much amazing *

21:37.464 --> 21:40.333
* And you've been there for me *

21:40.333 --> 21:42.635
* Together we're beautiful *

21:42.635 --> 21:45.237
* I want you to stay *

21:45.237 --> 21:46.673
* Hey *

21:46.673 --> 21:49.409
* Come on,
I know what you're thinking... *

21:49.409 --> 21:50.977
Yes?
The quadratic formula.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.080
Negative b plus or minus
the square root of b squared

21:54.080 --> 21:57.116
minus 4ac all over 2a.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.585
* *

21:58.585 --> 22:01.053
* I can tell that
we're gonna be friends *

22:01.053 --> 22:03.322
(exhausted gasping)

22:03.322 --> 22:05.892
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:05.892 --> 22:07.694
* Whoo-hoo *

22:07.694 --> 22:10.863
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:12.565 --> 22:15.101
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:15.101 --> 22:16.703
* Whoo-hoo... *

22:16.703 --> 22:19.739
I only had enough time
for 12 flying buttresses,

22:19.739 --> 22:22.174
but in actuality,
there are 26.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.943
* *

22:26.379 --> 22:28.715
"Then I'll be brief.
Oh, happy, dagger,

22:28.715 --> 22:30.016
Thank you, please.
"here is thy sheath.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.318
Thank you.
There rest and let me die."

22:32.318 --> 22:34.387
(sighs):
The show is Pippin,

22:34.387 --> 22:36.389
and I just wanted your name.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.592
(suppressed laughing)

22:39.592 --> 22:42.094
(laughter)
* I don't ever want it *

22:42.094 --> 22:44.731
* To end *

22:44.731 --> 22:47.500
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:47.500 --> 22:49.268
* Whoo-hoo *

22:49.268 --> 22:51.871
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:51.871 --> 22:54.273
* The way that you are *

22:54.273 --> 22:56.643
* You're pretty much amazing *

22:56.643 --> 22:58.611
* Whoo-hoo *

22:58.611 --> 23:00.647
* You're pretty much amazing *

23:00.647 --> 23:03.516
* While we're driving my car *

23:03.516 --> 23:05.217
* You're pretty much amazing *

23:05.217 --> 23:08.588
* You do it for me *

23:08.588 --> 23:11.123
Hey, baby, how you doing?!

23:11.123 --> 23:12.224
* *

23:12.224 --> 23:15.194
* You're pretty much amazing *

23:15.194 --> 23:17.530
* I like your style *

23:17.530 --> 23:19.298
* You're pretty much
amazing... *

23:19.298 --> 23:21.734
(song fading out)

23:21.734 --> 23:24.136
* You're pretty much amazing *

23:24.136 --> 23:26.706
* Whoo-hoo *

23:26.706 --> 23:29.442
* You're pretty much
amazing... *

23:40.520 --> 23:42.188
Hi.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.222
Hello.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.724
Hi. Uh, I noticed

23:44.724 --> 23:46.559
you were wearing
penny loafers.

23:46.559 --> 23:47.860
Did your podiatrist

23:47.860 --> 23:49.896
suggest them,
or are you being ironic?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.564
I like old-fashioned things.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.566
Oh, we've noticed.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.135
Penny loafers are practical.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.403
Well,

23:57.403 --> 24:01.941
we may be on the brink of a
penny loafer fashion moment.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.477
Or not.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.819
(laughing)
That was awesome.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.556
Give that cupcake back.
Shut up!

24:16.556 --> 24:19.025
(laughing):
Come on.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.962
That's a good cupcake.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.531
NANCY: Principal Fineman,
I feel strongly,

24:24.531 --> 24:27.066
students should be given
a more nutritious alternative

24:27.066 --> 24:30.336
in the cafeteria--
perhaps a salad bar.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.506
A salad bar.
Terrific idea.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.741
Yeah. Hi.
I think the principal

24:34.741 --> 24:36.408
wants to yell at me
or something.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.710
Let's see.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.979
Oh, yes-- there may be
traces of lead paint

24:39.979 --> 24:42.114
in the utility shed
next to the volleyball courts.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.652
But I can't be certain until
the lab report comes back.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.053
Lead paint.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.320
That's bad, right?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.922
Very bad.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.158
But there's no
need to panic.

24:52.158 --> 24:56.162
Finally, I urge you
to offer a course in CPR.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.064
(both snicker)

24:58.064 --> 25:00.199
I noticed it wasn't part
of your curriculum.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.835
I'm certified, and I have
found great peace of mind

25:02.835 --> 25:04.871
knowing I may save
a life someday.

25:04.871 --> 25:08.708
(percussion playing,
cheerleaders shouting)

25:08.708 --> 25:11.644
CHEERLEADERS:
So hot! So hot! So hot...

25:11.644 --> 25:14.080
(cheering, whistling)

25:20.319 --> 25:22.722
(whooping)

25:27.694 --> 25:29.996
(cheering)

25:29.996 --> 25:33.365
(percussion continues,
cheerleaders continue)

25:33.365 --> 25:35.367
CHEERLEADERS: Ching, ching,
ching, ching, ching, ching!

25:35.367 --> 25:36.502
Where's the money?

25:36.502 --> 25:38.104
Cha-ching, where's the money?

25:44.343 --> 25:47.580
(coughing, choking)

25:48.615 --> 25:52.218
Corky! Corky!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.485
M-My brother's choking!

25:53.485 --> 25:54.854
(blows whistle)

25:54.854 --> 25:56.088
My brother's choking!
Time-out! Time-out!

25:56.088 --> 25:58.357
(Corky choking)
Does anyone know CPR?

25:58.357 --> 25:59.926
Does anyone know CPR?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.761
NANCY:
I do. I know CPR.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.865
Excuse me.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.300
(Corky coughing, choking)

26:09.335 --> 26:11.037
MAN:
Whoa, is he okay?

26:11.037 --> 26:13.640
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be okay.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.347
(loud cough, girl squeals)

26:22.882 --> 26:24.651
GIRL:
Is he breathing?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.753
BOY:
He's moving...

26:26.753 --> 26:28.655
BOY 2: Should we
call an ambulance?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.625
(giggling)

26:32.625 --> 26:34.526
(laughing)

26:34.526 --> 26:36.696
Oh, you idiot!

26:36.696 --> 26:40.633
You were supposed to kiss her,
lip lock-- that was the plan!

26:40.633 --> 26:43.469
(crowd laughing)

26:43.469 --> 26:45.371
* *

26:45.371 --> 26:47.907
(laughter continues)

26:49.676 --> 26:52.745
(acoustic guitar plays intro)

27:01.420 --> 27:04.023
* *

27:13.766 --> 27:16.302
* *

27:25.244 --> 27:26.713
* How *

27:26.713 --> 27:29.949
* Does it feel *

27:29.949 --> 27:32.284
* To treat me *

27:32.284 --> 27:34.086
* Like you do? *

27:35.054 --> 27:39.091
* When you laid your hands
upon me *

27:40.459 --> 27:42.929
* And told me *

27:42.929 --> 27:46.032
* Who you are *

27:46.032 --> 27:50.937
* I thought I was mistaken *

27:50.937 --> 27:54.173
* I thought I heard your words *

27:55.207 --> 27:57.609
(thumping)

27:57.609 --> 28:01.280
(song continues faintly
over earphones)

28:17.629 --> 28:20.066
* *

28:27.273 --> 28:29.441
* *

28:40.319 --> 28:42.755
* *

28:46.759 --> 28:48.828
(door creaks)

28:59.806 --> 29:01.874
I'm looking forward
to the journey,

29:01.874 --> 29:04.643
and I don't care
if a woman unaccompanied

29:04.643 --> 29:06.745
is considered to be shameful.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.349
I... I've done nothing wrong.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.919
My heart is...

29:12.919 --> 29:14.453
MAN:
Yes?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.022
Your heart is...?

29:16.022 --> 29:19.525
DIRECTOR: Cut.
DEHLIA (sighs): Uh...

29:19.525 --> 29:20.659
Sorry.

29:20.659 --> 29:23.129
(indistinct chatter)

29:23.129 --> 29:25.531
DIRECTOR:
And... action.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.770
I'm looking forward
to the journey, and...

29:31.770 --> 29:34.673
I don't care that...
(panting)

29:34.673 --> 29:35.908
I feel sick.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.110
I need to stop.
Cut.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.012
(indistinct chatter)

29:40.012 --> 29:41.747
ASSISTANT:
Quiet, please!

29:41.747 --> 29:42.815
(beeping on film)

29:42.815 --> 29:43.850
(gasps)

29:43.850 --> 29:46.252
What are you doing?

29:46.252 --> 29:47.486
I-I-I'm sorry.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.655
DEHLIA: I'm looking forward
to the journey...

29:49.655 --> 29:51.057
That door was unlocked.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.691
Um, the shutters
had rusted closed,

29:52.691 --> 29:54.861
and the bulbs
were all burnt out.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.762
Well, leave it on.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.564
Well...

30:02.268 --> 30:05.938
I haven't been here
since the night she...

30:07.273 --> 30:10.242
You were here
the night she died?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.346
How long did you work for her?

30:14.346 --> 30:16.348
The year
I got out of the service,

30:16.348 --> 30:18.217
I went to work at the studio.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.753
They sent me over here
to project a film for her,

30:21.753 --> 30:26.625
and she asked me to stay
and take care of her, so I did.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.161
That was 1971.

30:29.161 --> 30:33.565
When she disappeared,
did you know where she was?

30:34.901 --> 30:36.602
No.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.072
She never married,

30:40.072 --> 30:43.209
and she seemed to be
very private,

30:43.209 --> 30:45.912
but there must have been a...

30:45.912 --> 30:48.114
there must have been a man...

30:48.114 --> 30:50.316
someone she loved?

30:51.783 --> 30:53.219
(exhales)

30:53.219 --> 30:56.855
Every man who met her
fell in love with her.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.959
It just couldn't be helped.

31:02.361 --> 31:06.232
I just don't know
if she ever felt love herself.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.201
(quiet, mysterious theme
playing)

31:12.939 --> 31:15.307
(crickets chirping
outside)

31:26.018 --> 31:28.320
* *

31:35.861 --> 31:38.130
* *

31:45.837 --> 31:48.207
* *

31:57.416 --> 31:58.750
Hi.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.721
Yeah, I'm sorry about
the weirdness the other day.

32:02.721 --> 32:07.559
I have to say, my feelings were
a little bruised, but, um,

32:07.559 --> 32:08.827
thank you, Corky.

32:08.827 --> 32:11.030
An apology is the sign
of a gentleman.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.531
Inga wrote me in
to the shenanigans.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.167
She's my sister, but I also
think she might be the Devil.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.436
Also, you know,
I thought if you gave me

32:17.436 --> 32:19.305
mouth-to-mouth,
it would be a fantastic way

32:19.305 --> 32:21.540
for us to get
to know each other.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.542
The truth is,

32:23.542 --> 32:24.676
you're awesome.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.078
By the way,

32:26.078 --> 32:27.613
did you know there's
a mystery to this house?

32:27.613 --> 32:30.316
I know.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.218
I only recently discovered

32:32.218 --> 32:34.486
that movies aren't shot
from beginning to end.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.256
So I took the last movie
she ever made

32:37.256 --> 32:38.490
and reassembled the shots

32:38.490 --> 32:41.727
in the order
they were photographed.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.365
CORKY:
O... kay.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.001
I just noticed
something strange.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.070
The last month before
she disappeared,

32:51.070 --> 32:53.705
she's only shown from here up.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.345
Maybe she was pregnant.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.947
She didn't have any kids--
never married

33:01.947 --> 33:04.483
and no kids.
It's just a hunch.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.353
Also, the photograph
in this magazine

33:07.353 --> 33:08.954
is dated just
after her reappearance.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.589
There's an "X" on her robe.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.659
I believe that insignia will
tell us where she was hiding.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.527
I've called all
the hospitals

33:15.527 --> 33:17.996
and hotels that include
the letter "X" in it,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.531
but, so far, nothing.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.833
(sighs):
I need to talk to someone

33:21.833 --> 33:23.335
who's an expert in clothing.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.437
Oh, and one
more thing.

33:25.437 --> 33:30.142
She's often with this man,
but he's always obscured.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.144
A hand at the edge of a picture,

33:32.144 --> 33:33.812
a silhouette,

33:33.812 --> 33:36.082
even a blur.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.484
I think she called him Z.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.120
I have to find out
who this man is.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.590
I just have to solve this case.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.957
(sighs)

33:45.957 --> 33:47.859
What do you think?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.461
I think the ability to sleuth

33:49.461 --> 33:51.997
is an attractive quality
in a woman.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.799
Mm.

33:56.735 --> 33:57.703
(window bangs)

34:01.307 --> 34:03.875
Hey, don't they have
a costume department

34:03.875 --> 34:05.444
on the set of
every film?

34:05.444 --> 34:07.146
Yeah, but you should know
that movie people

34:07.146 --> 34:08.580
are kind of crazy.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.482
Oh, goodness, how
crazy can they be?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.484
Really crazy.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.054
You're fine.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.190
Oh, I just had a question.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.925
And I'm all out of answers.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.159
You look '50s.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.428
Go to set.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.629
But I was just wondering
if maybe...

34:23.629 --> 34:24.630
Now!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.431
Here we go! Okay,
we're moving.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.199
We're moving, people!
We're on our way!

34:28.199 --> 34:30.902
We are moving!

34:30.902 --> 34:32.103
I, eh... uh...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.042
All right, let's just
shoot the rehearsal.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.710
Has anybody seen
Mr. Fancy Pants?

34:39.710 --> 34:41.713
Right here, you idiot.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.547
(chuckles)

34:42.547 --> 34:44.150
Nickname. I love
a nickname.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.685
Not a nickname, Andy,
it's not a nickname.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.353
You really are an idiot.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.788
Oh, all right,
all right.

34:49.788 --> 34:50.755
I, um, uh...

34:50.755 --> 34:52.056
Okay, we're shooting
the rehearsal!

34:52.056 --> 34:53.891
Excuse me,
sir, no, sir.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.127
No, I...

34:55.127 --> 34:57.229
By the way, it's "action,"

34:57.229 --> 34:59.998
not "begin the acting."

34:59.998 --> 35:01.700
Action.
Locking it up!

35:01.700 --> 35:03.935
Last looks everybody!
Last looks!

35:03.935 --> 35:05.871
Walking away! Walking away!
Quiet, please!

35:05.871 --> 35:09.808
And we're rolling!

35:09.808 --> 35:11.210
Oh, you're cute.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.878
(chuckles):
Thank you.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.880
Okay, you hate crime.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.947
And action!

35:15.947 --> 35:19.985
Hold him right there, boys.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.254
Spider Winetrap.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.656
As I live and breathe.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.492
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.294
You have the right
to an attorney.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.028
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but...

35:30.028 --> 35:31.330
What?
I'm sorry.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.232
This just feels inauthentic.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.000
Feels what?
Well, the scene takes place

35:35.000 --> 35:37.903
in the '50s, but you're reading
Miranda to the suspect.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.738
Um, excuse me!

35:39.738 --> 35:42.073
Why in the name
of sweet Christmas

35:42.073 --> 35:44.310
is this tiny person talking?!

35:46.312 --> 35:48.614
Well, reading of Miranda
upon arrest wasn't law

35:48.614 --> 35:50.182
until '63.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.517
Is that right?

35:51.517 --> 35:54.052
The scene is still
delicious either way.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.154
What's your name?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.189
Uh, Nancy Drew.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.590
I'm Bruce.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.259
All right,
I'll tell you what,

36:00.259 --> 36:01.727
why don't you
direct the movie,

36:01.727 --> 36:03.061
Nancy Drew?

36:03.061 --> 36:04.363
(grunts)

36:04.363 --> 36:06.765
(laughter)

36:06.765 --> 36:10.902
Listen, Nancy, would you,
would you consider, you know,

36:10.902 --> 36:13.405
directing this film?

36:13.405 --> 36:15.941
'Cause we can get rid
of this guy in a second.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.345
Is there a law against common
courtesy in Los Angeles?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.946
Courtesy is
so awesome.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.248
I'm really into it.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.849
In my book, courtesy counts.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.518
I'd like to read
that book, Nancy.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.329
It's not an "X";
they're palm trees.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.365
Okay.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.467
What does that mean?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.971
NANCY:
The insignia on her robe.

36:45.971 --> 36:49.475
It's, um...

36:49.475 --> 36:51.443
something "Palms."

36:51.443 --> 36:53.479
Oh, now I get it.

36:53.479 --> 36:54.713
Just kidding,
I don't.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.250
Southern Pines,
California Hot Springs...

36:59.318 --> 37:02.554
Twin Palms Bungalows and Spa.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.800
* *

37:18.069 --> 37:21.172
There was a fire
some 20 years ago

37:21.172 --> 37:22.674
and all the records
were burned.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.443
And on top of that,
I'm afraid

37:24.443 --> 37:26.312
our guest list
is confidential.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.079
Oh.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.315
(sighs)

37:30.248 --> 37:33.285
Where's the closest hospital?

37:35.821 --> 37:38.790
All the children born
in one week, 24 years ago?

37:38.790 --> 37:39.858
Yes.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.993
Well, all the ones
given up for adoption.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.630
See, the birth mother, she may
have left money for the child...

37:44.630 --> 37:46.732
I'm sorry, but those
records are sealed.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.900
Only a court order can
open those records,

37:48.900 --> 37:51.069
and even then, only by a
child seeking a parent.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.070
Are you the child?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.439
No.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.408
But, um, thank you anyway.

38:00.245 --> 38:03.048
Here's a blondie
for your trouble.

38:12.824 --> 38:16.027
(low, indistinct
conversation)

38:23.769 --> 38:25.737
Did... did you make these?

38:26.738 --> 38:29.675
No, Hannah our housekeeper,

38:29.675 --> 38:31.009
back in
River Heights, did.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.111
She sent over a tin.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.680
She's a wonderful baker.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.349
It's so weird-- my mother
made these when I was a kid.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.884
I-I haven't had one in years.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.824
It's so perfectly moist.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.860
Come here.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.271
The county... recommends
a pediatrician

39:00.271 --> 39:02.374
to new adoptive
parents.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.043
The doctor's files
aren't sealed.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.044
This might help.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.981
Thank you.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.418
And you didn't
get that from me.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.723
24 years ago.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.590
Wow.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.225
That is so long ago.

39:20.225 --> 39:24.930
Yes. It would have been a
first appointment-- a newborn.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.298
I know it seems
a little disorgani-zized,

39:27.298 --> 39:31.437
but I know where
everything is.

39:31.437 --> 39:33.639
(laughs)

39:35.741 --> 39:39.077
(whispers):
Oh... Ow...

39:39.077 --> 39:40.078
Right there.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.079
Here it is.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.649
There were two newborns
that week...

39:43.649 --> 39:45.784
No, make that three.

39:45.784 --> 39:49.588
Oh, but, uh, I don't think
I can release any information.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.056
Let me call headquarters.
(phone ringing)

39:51.056 --> 39:52.190
Oh!

39:52.190 --> 39:53.825
Maybe that's them.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.293
Hello.
Hi, Carol, it's Jimmy.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.895
Oh, Jimmy.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.297
Yeah, no, I was looking for it,
and I found it, I found it.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.299
I did find it
and it... Oh.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.401
That's not it,
but it's pink and, uh,

40:03.401 --> 40:05.871
it wasn't, no, it wasn't where
I thought it was going to be,

40:05.871 --> 40:07.473
because it's...
JIMMY: I think it's yellow.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.574
I put it somewhere else.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.941
Yeah, oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.543
I'm going to have
to call you back.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.811
JIMMY:
Can you get it to me?

40:12.811 --> 40:15.447
I'm going to have
to call you back.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.382
Nice try, squirt.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.150
Nice try.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.819
(into to "Nice Day"
by Persephone's Bee's playing)

40:20.819 --> 40:22.654
* On a nice day *

40:24.623 --> 40:25.991
* On a nice day *

40:29.461 --> 40:31.196
* I don't care what they say *

40:32.898 --> 40:35.834
* I don't care what they say *

40:35.834 --> 40:38.003
* On a nice day *

40:39.805 --> 40:42.040
* On a nice day *

40:46.478 --> 40:47.746
* On a... *

40:47.746 --> 40:50.682
Hello, I'm looking
for Jane Brighton.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.751
Are you Jane Brighton?

40:52.751 --> 40:54.886
Are you Martine Dahlberg?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.555
Yeah. Why?

40:56.555 --> 40:58.790
I was just wondering,
were you adopted?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.225
Are you Susan Thabit?

41:00.225 --> 41:01.326
Uh-huh.

41:01.326 --> 41:02.761
Were you adopted?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.329
Are you Martine Dahlberg?

41:04.329 --> 41:05.396
Yes.

41:05.396 --> 41:06.431
Were you adopted?

41:06.431 --> 41:08.266
Hello, um...

41:08.266 --> 41:09.434
Can I help you?

41:09.434 --> 41:11.603
Sorry, no.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.840
No.

41:15.373 --> 41:16.575
No.

41:16.575 --> 41:17.609
(sighs)

41:17.609 --> 41:19.678
No.
No.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.148
No.
No.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.316
No.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.785
Uh-uh.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.221
No.
No.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.389
Nope.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.458
-No. -No. -No.
-No. -No. -No.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.661
(baby crying in distance)

41:40.465 --> 41:41.533
(knocking)

41:41.533 --> 41:42.801
Hello?

41:42.801 --> 41:45.503
Um, is there
a Jane Brighton here?

41:45.503 --> 41:46.605
(sighs)

41:46.605 --> 41:49.274
That depends on who's asking.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.176
Were you adopted?

41:53.178 --> 41:55.213
Yeah.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.286
Who are you?

42:07.425 --> 42:09.160
You're who I'm looking for.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.962
I am?

42:13.031 --> 42:14.600
Hi.

42:19.738 --> 42:22.207
You're kidding.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.710
Did your parents tell you
that you were adopted?

42:24.710 --> 42:26.712
It wasn't hard to figure out.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.546
I mean, I didn't look
anything like them.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.848
My mother passed away,

42:29.848 --> 42:33.518
and then my father, um...

42:33.518 --> 42:34.886
I had to get away from him.

42:34.886 --> 42:38.223
Uh, I left home early.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.359
Dehlia Draycott!

42:41.359 --> 42:43.862
Wow.

42:43.862 --> 42:46.031
Dehlia may have made
a provision for you.

42:46.031 --> 42:47.666
If we can prove
that you're her daughter,

42:47.666 --> 42:48.934
there may be some money.

42:50.769 --> 42:53.438
Is this some kind of
a practical joke?

42:53.438 --> 42:54.640
Oh, no.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.675
I don't joke.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.276
CORKY:
I get that a lot.

42:58.276 --> 43:00.646
I'm 12, but I skipped
a few grades.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.147
NANCY: Because you were
ahead academically?

43:02.147 --> 43:03.348
Heck no.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.016
There just wasn't any
action in junior high,

43:05.016 --> 43:07.786
so my dad made
a few calls.

43:07.786 --> 43:09.387
Anyway, I was, uh,
wondering if we could do,

43:09.387 --> 43:12.323
like, a dinner thing,
like, Saturday-ish?

43:12.323 --> 43:13.625
Not a date.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.493
Corky, you've been
really nice to me...

43:15.493 --> 43:18.163
I'll show you the sights,
and we'll have a few laughs.

43:18.163 --> 43:20.331
But there's this guy
back in River Heights.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.868
Oh. Ouch. Okay.

43:22.868 --> 43:25.937
Well, you still need to
eat, and it's not a date.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.339
Okay, seeing as how
it's not a date...

43:28.339 --> 43:29.875
(gasps)

43:30.876 --> 43:33.178
(tires screeching)

43:37.582 --> 43:40.686
Go! Go, go, go, go!

43:40.686 --> 43:42.520
They almost hit us.
Hurry!

43:42.520 --> 43:43.621
Go, go, go, go, go!

43:43.621 --> 43:45.657
Hey. Hey!

43:48.293 --> 43:50.528
I wonder who
tried to kill us.

43:50.528 --> 43:51.897
Yeah, I'm wondering
that, too.

43:51.897 --> 43:54.332
In fact, I'm kind of
freaking out about it!

43:54.332 --> 43:56.167
Well...

43:56.167 --> 43:57.803
usually when someone
tries to kill me,

43:57.803 --> 43:59.938
it's because
I'm on to something.

43:59.938 --> 44:01.206
Oh, you have a cut.

44:02.607 --> 44:05.844
There were dealer plates
on the SUV.

44:05.844 --> 44:08.379
I made note of the make,
year and model.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.548
Plus the damage sustained
from hitting the barrier

44:10.548 --> 44:11.917
could help us
identify it, too.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.023
You're just not like
the other girls, Nancy.

44:23.328 --> 44:25.363
(sighs)

44:27.598 --> 44:29.200
(phone rings)

44:29.200 --> 44:30.535
Hello?

44:30.535 --> 44:34.773
MAN: Do not look into
this Dehlia Draycott business.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.475
If you proceed,
you will be harmed.

44:37.475 --> 44:39.945
Oh.
Do you understand?

44:39.945 --> 44:42.480
We're not interested
in mud slide insurance,

44:42.480 --> 44:43.849
but, um, thank you for calling.

44:43.849 --> 44:45.250
Have a nice day.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.251
(phone beeps off)

44:57.628 --> 44:59.731
Whoa, what's this?

44:59.731 --> 45:00.899
I apologize, sir.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.100
Allow me to
introduce myself.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.035
My name is
Nancy Drew.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.403
It's very nice to make
your acquaintance.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.238
I've been trying to
set up an appointment

45:07.238 --> 45:09.174
with your office, but, um...
Posture, eye contact.

45:09.174 --> 45:11.977
Pay attention, people--
that's breeding.

45:11.977 --> 45:13.611
I-I was just
wondering

45:13.611 --> 45:16.314
if I could have five minutes
to discuss something with you.

45:16.314 --> 45:17.682
Anytime at all.

45:17.682 --> 45:19.017
Here's my card.

45:20.786 --> 45:23.121
(chuckles)

45:23.121 --> 45:24.122
Oh.

45:26.758 --> 45:28.960
Thank you.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.162
It's about one of your
clients, a movie star.

45:31.162 --> 45:35.233
(chuckles): All my clients
are movie stars, muffin.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.568
Well, I may have found some
evidence suggesting that...

45:37.568 --> 45:38.636
Astonishing.

45:38.636 --> 45:40.538
Um, it may
imply that...

45:40.538 --> 45:42.140
Absolutely astonishing.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.943
As I was
saying, um...

45:44.943 --> 45:46.744
I'm very disappointed, Senator.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.914
Well, as you know,
you do owe me

45:48.914 --> 45:52.417
a favor or two.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.886
Well, talk to somebody
else on your staff.

45:54.886 --> 45:56.187
Maybe they
can help you.

46:00.225 --> 46:01.126
(knocking)

46:01.126 --> 46:02.560
Jane, are you there?

46:02.560 --> 46:04.395
(locks clicking)

46:04.395 --> 46:05.730
Hi.

46:05.730 --> 46:07.899
I saw the lawyers who represent
the estate today, and...

46:07.899 --> 46:09.935
It's all right,
I don't need any help.

46:09.935 --> 46:11.469
What do you mean?

46:11.469 --> 46:13.471
Don't you want to know if
you're Dehlia's daughter?

46:13.471 --> 46:14.840
Just leave us alone, okay?

46:16.041 --> 46:18.143
You seem like
a really nice person.

46:18.143 --> 46:19.177
I'm sorry.

46:21.913 --> 46:23.114
(lock clicks)

46:28.586 --> 46:30.355
(owl hooting, crickets chirping)

46:38.729 --> 46:41.566
The will is in
the Chinese box.

46:41.566 --> 46:44.970
So there is a will.

46:55.380 --> 46:59.317
* *

46:59.317 --> 47:01.552
(voices playing over laptop)

47:09.027 --> 47:11.629
Miss Draycott
collected chinoiserie.

47:11.629 --> 47:14.632
Last year, the owner sold off
the most valuable pieces,

47:14.632 --> 47:16.067
against my wishes.

47:16.067 --> 47:19.037
Do you remember
the name of the dealer?

47:19.037 --> 47:21.439
You ask a lot
of questions.

47:21.439 --> 47:22.273
Is it this place?

47:22.273 --> 47:23.841
I noticed the ad was circled.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.911
Do they have the box?

47:25.911 --> 47:27.678
Let me tell you
something, young lady.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.915
Everyone who has tried to
piece this thing together

47:29.915 --> 47:31.316
has run into trouble.

47:31.316 --> 47:34.452
(phone ringing)

47:34.452 --> 47:35.853
Hello?

47:35.853 --> 47:39.024
So you should be getting
an early birthday present

47:39.024 --> 47:42.160
"slash" reward thing,
for going along with

47:42.160 --> 47:44.896
my no sleuthing law
in California thing.

47:44.896 --> 47:46.231
Dad, you shouldn't have.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.366
I don't really deserve it.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.434
Yes, you do.

47:49.434 --> 47:50.468
(doorbell ringing)

47:50.468 --> 47:52.137
I know it hasn't
been easy for you,

47:52.137 --> 47:54.139
and this will make me feel
a little less guilty.

47:54.139 --> 47:57.042
What, what is it?

47:57.042 --> 47:58.910
Ah, just walk outside.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.180
Hi.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.581
My sister dropped me off,

48:03.581 --> 48:05.416
and now she won't
go away.

48:06.251 --> 48:07.518
Leave!

48:07.518 --> 48:09.120
My roadster.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.655
Dad, how did you get it here?

48:10.655 --> 48:12.457
Happy almost your birthday.

48:12.457 --> 48:13.258
Ned!

48:13.258 --> 48:15.060
You drove this all the way here?

48:15.060 --> 48:18.029
Uh, yeah, wouldn't fit
in my suitcase.

48:18.029 --> 48:21.032
I've missed this car so much.

48:21.032 --> 48:23.935
And you-- I've missed
the car and you.

48:25.436 --> 48:27.105
Oh, uh, Ned,

48:27.105 --> 48:28.406
Corky, Corky, Ned.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.575
Ned is my...

48:30.575 --> 48:33.211
really good friend

48:33.211 --> 48:34.745
from River Heights.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.214
River Heights,
right.

48:36.214 --> 48:38.216
That's in one of
those flyover states.

48:38.216 --> 48:40.685
Did I interrupt something?

48:40.685 --> 48:43.321
Yes, actually, you did.

48:44.990 --> 48:46.691
CARSON:
Hello? Hello?

48:46.691 --> 48:47.792
Oh, Dad.
CARSON: Nancy?

48:47.792 --> 48:48.994
Thank you so much.

48:48.994 --> 48:50.228
We have to go.

48:50.228 --> 48:51.429
(phone beeps off)

48:53.231 --> 48:56.301
Corky's going on
a date with her?

48:56.301 --> 48:57.202
Whoa.

48:57.202 --> 49:00.338
Nancy weirdo has,
like, two dates.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.274
Oh. That other
one is cute.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.642
I mean, I don't
usually go for

49:04.642 --> 49:07.112
the "just back from slopping
the hogs" type, but...

49:07.112 --> 49:08.613
(chuckles)
he's cute.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.315
("The Delicate Place"
rock intro playing)

49:10.315 --> 49:14.085
* Have you got the answer? *

49:14.085 --> 49:19.490
* Have I yet won the part? *

49:19.490 --> 49:25.096
* Is this just your way
of breaking my heart? *

49:29.134 --> 49:31.969
Hello. Would you like
to order some drinks?

49:31.969 --> 49:34.439
I'll have a glass
of milk, please.

49:34.439 --> 49:35.240
Ah, milk--

49:35.240 --> 49:37.142
how refreshingly wholesome.

49:37.142 --> 49:39.077
I'll have the exact same thing.

49:39.077 --> 49:41.412
Who is this person?

49:41.412 --> 49:44.082
Nancy and I met,
and things just clicked.

49:44.082 --> 49:46.917
We laugh, we talk,
we keep it real.

49:46.917 --> 49:48.686
We're basically
best friends.

49:48.686 --> 49:51.656
It's funny that
she never mentioned you.

49:53.124 --> 49:54.492
Hey, buddy,

49:54.492 --> 49:56.127
she wants your drink order.

49:56.127 --> 49:59.697
Um, can I get
an iced latte?

49:59.697 --> 50:02.867
No latte in
Chinese restaurant, silly.

50:02.867 --> 50:04.135
Yeah, silly.
Excuse me...?

50:04.135 --> 50:07.638
No latte in
the Chinese restaurant.

50:07.638 --> 50:08.806
Don't talk
to me, okay?

50:08.806 --> 50:10.141
NANCY:
All right.

50:10.141 --> 50:11.542
Wow, this is fun, huh?

50:11.542 --> 50:12.810
Um, you know,

50:12.810 --> 50:14.645
Ned and I have known each other
since second grade.

50:14.645 --> 50:16.447
He helped me
solve the mystery

50:16.447 --> 50:18.015
of the missing
chalkboard erasers.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.017
It was a janitor.

50:20.017 --> 50:22.353
Ooh, fantastic!

50:23.154 --> 50:25.990
Oh, my gosh.

50:25.990 --> 50:27.892
How funny.
(chuckles)

50:27.892 --> 50:30.061
Here we are and here you are.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.662
Hi. What's your name?

50:31.662 --> 50:32.663
Ned?

50:32.663 --> 50:34.632
You're not sure?

50:34.632 --> 50:35.600
No.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.602
I mean, yeah,
yes, I'm sure.

50:37.602 --> 50:40.905
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

50:40.905 --> 50:42.107
Why are you here?

50:42.107 --> 50:44.909
Hey, hey, guys,
don't gang up on me.

50:44.909 --> 50:46.744
I'm sensitive.

50:56.821 --> 50:58.389
(door bells jingling)

50:58.389 --> 50:59.824
Hello.

50:59.824 --> 51:01.126
I'm looking for a box.

51:01.126 --> 51:02.993
That is, one in particular.

51:02.993 --> 51:04.929
What kind of box?

51:04.929 --> 51:07.098
Um, Chinese.

51:07.932 --> 51:13.371
Well... you've come
to the right place.

51:13.371 --> 51:16.441
So this is why
you wanted Chinese food.

51:16.441 --> 51:18.409
What are you guys
doing in here?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.345
This is so nonlinear.

51:20.345 --> 51:23.181
Everybody pick a row,
check inside each box.

51:23.181 --> 51:25.150
We're looking for a will.

51:26.651 --> 51:28.386
(kids chattering)

51:28.386 --> 51:29.654
Wait, what's over there?
Hey.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.556
CORKY:
Guys, did you see this box yet?

51:31.556 --> 51:33.224
Nothing there.
Whoa.

51:33.224 --> 51:35.760
No, no, no, don't...
don't touch.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.763
Hey, hey, watch this top.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.231
That is very expensive.

51:40.231 --> 51:43.468
* I'm too insistent
like nobody showed me *

51:43.468 --> 51:44.969
* How to keep relationships *

51:44.969 --> 51:47.104
CORKY:
Did you see this?

51:47.104 --> 51:48.906
It's big.
Put that down.

51:48.906 --> 51:50.875
(playful growling)

51:50.875 --> 51:52.143
(screams)

51:52.143 --> 51:53.478
What? What, you
think you're funny?

51:53.478 --> 51:55.780
Do you think
you're funny?

51:55.780 --> 51:58.216
So not cute.

52:01.051 --> 52:03.288
There is one more.

52:08.092 --> 52:10.395
(quiet, ominous tones playing)

52:16.667 --> 52:19.770
So, Nance...

52:19.770 --> 52:21.772
what's the deal
with you and Ned?

52:21.772 --> 52:23.508
(faint beeping)
Do you hear something?

52:23.508 --> 52:25.876
No, I mean, are you
two, like, a thing?

52:25.876 --> 52:27.077
(beeping)

52:27.077 --> 52:28.246
Um...

52:28.246 --> 52:30.014
Excuse me, I have
to defuse this bomb.

52:30.014 --> 52:31.081
No kidding.

52:31.081 --> 52:33.184
Love is a
battlefield.

52:33.184 --> 52:37.522
(suspenseful theme playing)

52:57.107 --> 52:59.344
* *

53:08.953 --> 53:13.190
* *

53:22.833 --> 53:25.836
* *

53:35.179 --> 53:38.383
(quiet, gentle theme plays)

53:43.388 --> 53:47.358
(car door shuts,
engine starts)

53:49.394 --> 53:51.496
(onlookers shouting)

53:53.298 --> 53:55.633
That's the SUV
that tried to run us down!

53:55.633 --> 53:57.468
The side's damaged.
Come on.

53:57.468 --> 53:58.736
What was that?
Are you okay?

53:58.736 --> 53:59.970
What was that?
NED: Hurry, we're losing them.

53:59.970 --> 54:02.707
Oh, so you meant
literally a bomb.

54:02.707 --> 54:05.109
What was that?
What was that? Are you okay?

54:05.109 --> 54:06.844
(sirens blaring)
Hello?

54:06.844 --> 54:08.245
(tires screeching)

54:10.014 --> 54:12.450
(man shouting in Chinese)

54:12.450 --> 54:13.484
They turned up that street.

54:13.484 --> 54:14.785
CORKY:
Hold on a sec.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.321
I thought we were
driving away from them.

54:16.321 --> 54:17.788
That's the only reason
why I got in the car.

54:17.788 --> 54:19.857
Buckled up?
I'm fine.

54:19.857 --> 54:22.560
(tires screeching)

54:23.127 --> 54:24.329
Buckling up.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.404
Say we actually do
catch up with them,

54:33.404 --> 54:34.439
what happens then?

54:34.439 --> 54:36.240
Seriously.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.476
It really gets my goat when
someone tries to kill me.

54:38.476 --> 54:39.477
It's so rude.

54:39.477 --> 54:40.811
But it only makes me

54:40.811 --> 54:42.713
want to try harder.
Then let the horses run!

54:42.713 --> 54:45.683
We will go the posted
speed limit and no faster.

54:46.884 --> 54:48.719
No!

54:51.556 --> 54:54.359
Everybody in the universe drives
over the speed limit, Nancy.

54:54.359 --> 54:55.693
What Nancy's trying to say is

54:55.693 --> 54:57.362
that the ends do not
justify the means.

54:57.362 --> 54:58.563
Your means will lose them.

54:58.563 --> 55:00.598
It's important
to judge the ends

55:00.598 --> 55:01.732
and judge the means
independently,

55:01.732 --> 55:03.267
in order to do
what's right.

55:03.267 --> 55:05.503
Didn't you promise your father
that you wouldn't sleuth?

55:06.371 --> 55:08.539
(tires screeching,
horns blaring)

55:09.507 --> 55:11.008
Aren't you breaking
that promise?

55:13.243 --> 55:14.779
(sighs)

55:15.546 --> 55:17.882
What are you going to do?

55:18.616 --> 55:22.453
I have to stop working
on this case.

55:22.453 --> 55:24.622
I have to stop and be normal.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.326
(tires screeching)

55:29.326 --> 55:30.561
(horns blaring)

55:41.305 --> 55:42.607
What's this?

55:42.607 --> 55:45.376
Oh, just normal stuff.

55:45.376 --> 55:46.677
Normal teenage stuff.

55:48.479 --> 55:50.715
Okay, carry on.

55:54.218 --> 55:56.020
Ow! He just
pinched me.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.287
Deal with it.

55:57.287 --> 55:58.989
If we're gonna baby-sit him,
we should get paid.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.660
Ned, why is your shirt
all wrinkled?

56:02.660 --> 56:05.229
'Cause my closet's
six inches deep.

56:05.229 --> 56:06.964
That's not possible.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.533
How could...

56:09.534 --> 56:11.636
Show me.

56:16.273 --> 56:17.842
CORKY:
What are you guys doing?

56:19.644 --> 56:22.146
"Hey, Corky,
we're super glad you asked.

56:22.146 --> 56:24.014
Would you like to tag along?"

56:27.552 --> 56:28.553
Seriously.

56:28.553 --> 56:30.054
Ooh, God!

56:30.054 --> 56:32.022
What is going on?!

56:36.093 --> 56:38.062
I just fell down.

56:40.465 --> 56:42.433
But I'm fine.

56:43.267 --> 56:44.769
(knocking)

56:44.769 --> 56:47.938
I still don't know
what's going on.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.945
Whenever you feel like
letting me know.

57:04.889 --> 57:06.891
(knocking)

57:09.293 --> 57:11.328
(hollow thudding)

57:11.996 --> 57:13.931
(latch clicks,
panel creaks)

57:15.633 --> 57:18.135
A secret passageway.

57:18.135 --> 57:21.472
So this is how the intruder's
been getting upstairs.

57:21.472 --> 57:23.140
This is nuts.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.109
Ned, will you
get my flashlight?

57:25.109 --> 57:26.711
It's in my kit.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.247
Wouldn't this be
considered sleuthing?

57:30.247 --> 57:31.549
Who are we kidding?

57:31.549 --> 57:33.383
I can't stop.

57:33.383 --> 57:35.820
Once I find the will
and determine the identity of Z,

57:35.820 --> 57:37.722
I'll tell my father
everything.

57:37.722 --> 57:39.890
He'll understand.

57:39.890 --> 57:41.792
I mean, how else am I
going to help Jane?

57:43.093 --> 57:44.829
It's important.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.098
Don't you think?

57:48.599 --> 57:50.768
Yeah.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.808
(wood creaking)

58:07.284 --> 58:10.087
(clanking)

58:10.087 --> 58:12.022
(creaking)

58:14.391 --> 58:17.628
(chandeliers jingling)

58:21.098 --> 58:24.535
CORKY (distant):
Uh, what was that?

58:26.537 --> 58:28.706
I think we just
had an earthquake.

58:34.044 --> 58:36.080
Hello?

58:41.351 --> 58:43.788
NED:
Nancy!

58:47.792 --> 58:50.094
Are you all right?

58:50.094 --> 58:51.261
Where are you?

58:51.261 --> 58:53.263
I'm in the basement.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.237
Do you see anything?

59:03.107 --> 59:04.875
I found a tunnel,
and I'm going in.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.143
If I'm not back
in ten minutes,

59:06.143 --> 59:07.645
that means
something bad's happened.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.379
(giggles)

59:09.379 --> 59:11.949
I don't think
that was a joke.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.961
(eerie theme playing)

59:35.773 --> 59:39.009
(humming jauntily)

59:43.280 --> 59:44.615
(screaming)

59:44.615 --> 59:46.316
Hi!

59:48.185 --> 59:50.120
A tunnel?

59:50.120 --> 59:51.989
In the laundry room?

59:51.989 --> 59:54.291
What the hell
is that all about?

59:54.291 --> 59:55.125
John Leshing.

59:55.125 --> 59:56.493
He's a tenant in
this building.

59:56.493 --> 59:57.995
Hmm.

59:57.995 --> 59:59.363
He's the caretaker of the
Dehlia Draycott estate.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:01.699
If anyone knows about
the tunnel, he does.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.969
That man has always
given me the willies.

01:00:04.969 --> 01:00:07.204
The drowning kittens type.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.140
You know what I mean?

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.551
Hi. These are for you two.

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.552
Here you go.

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.954
Oh, okay.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.958
These are for you two.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:35.299
I hope you attend.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.036
(chuckles)

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.838
Wow.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:46.043
I know that she's weird,
but we have to go.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:47.477
Why?

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.147
Ned, my future husband,
is going to be there.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.519
(knocking)

01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:57.387
Jane? It's me Nancy.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:00.725
I was wondering if you and Allie
wanted to come to a party.

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:01.926
(knocking)

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.172
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:25.482
Wow, guys, your streamers
look great.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:27.684
Let's see yours.

01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:35.592
Yeah, yours
are all right.

01:01:35.592 --> 01:01:37.762
NANCY:
Downloading's cool...

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:39.629
but nothing sounds
like vinyl.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.931
(Latin dance music playing)

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:43.000
You couldn't be more right
if you tried, Nancy.

01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:50.975
(doorbell ringing)

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:55.379
Yeah.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:58.215
Hi.
Hi.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.583
Hey, I brought
a few friends.

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.318
I hope you don't mind,
all right?

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:02.853
Sure.

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:06.590
INGA:
Oh.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.859
I didn't get the memo
about it being a retarded theme.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:10.594
(Inga chuckles)

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.162
Hey, Ned.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:12.997
Hi.

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.465
Oh, can I take your coat?

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.466
Okay.

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.237
Um, refreshments are
in the dining room.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:23.908
We'll be having
a taffy pull later, guys.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:26.410
Oh.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.411
Come on in.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.478
Hi.
Hi.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.614
Hi. Refreshments in
the dining room.

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.616
Oh, hello. Hi.

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:35.385
Oh, you look
lovely.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:38.122
Hmm.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.493
(keypad beeping)

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:46.997
Leshing, come quick.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:48.232
(phone beeps off)

01:02:51.836 --> 01:02:54.071
(hip-hop music playing)

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:57.707
So did you grow up
in River Depths?

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.742
Tell me about it.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.177
Is there a river?

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:01.711
River Heights.
Oh!

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.013
Uh, yeah,
there's a river.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.314
Oh, oh, I knew that.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.450
I totally knew that.
How did I know that?

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.285
(laughs)

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.654
Oh, hey, hey.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:11.989
Oh, you want
to dance, right?

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:16.693
(gasps)

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:18.929
Hi.

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.065
Um, I just wanted to ask you

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:22.867
if you knew about
the secret passageway.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:25.069
I think you got your answer.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.906
Are you Z?

01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:31.175
Miss Drew...

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:35.179
I suggest you rejoin your guests
and enjoy the party.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.321
(pop music playing)

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.560
Hello.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.463
MAN: I warned you, drop
this Draycott business.

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:54.564
Who is this?

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:55.866
(dial tone)

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:57.467
(phone beeps off)

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.803
(phone ringing)

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:01.838
Please, stop calling here.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.340
CARSON:
Nancy?

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.875
Oh. Hi, Dad.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.410
Where are you?

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.946
I'm going to be even later
to your party than I said.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:09.947
I'm sorry, honey.

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:10.948
Is everything all right?

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:12.416
Sounds a little crazy there.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:14.818
Yeah, everything's
totally mellow.

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:15.819
Are you sure?

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.087
Absolutely.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.488
Hurry home.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:19.489
(phone beeps off)

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.636
Happy birthday, Nancy.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.239
BOY:
Back off, man!

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.606
Hey!

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.308
(crowd gasping)

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.382
(crowd cheering)

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.088
Somebody call 911!

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:52.422
You! You know CPR.

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:54.124
Come on, do something!
Trish is choking!

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.460
This is not a joke!

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.064
Out of the way,
out of the way.

01:05:00.064 --> 01:05:01.865
Coming through.

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.100
Oh, my God, do
something, do something.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.734
Somebody call 911!

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.136
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.074
Does she have
any food allergies?

01:05:10.074 --> 01:05:12.109
Uh, she is insanely
allergic to peanuts,

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:13.210
but she didn't eat anything.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:14.811
I had a peanut butter cookie,

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:16.580
and we were making out.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.182
Oh, my God.

01:05:18.182 --> 01:05:20.484
I need a knife
and a ballpoint pen.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:21.986
Huh?
Here.

01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:23.420
Here you go.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.189
I'd like to remind everybody
that unless you've had

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:26.556
advanced emergency
medical training,

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:29.093
you must never
attempt this on your own.

01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:34.264
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.136
(crowd gasping,
groaning)

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:40.570
Holy crap.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.310
(siren blaring)

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.777
You know, I have to admit,

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.447
I thought you were some insane
freak idiot person before,

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.949
but you're not.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.384
You're pretty terrific.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.820
Anyone can learn emergency
medical procedures.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.456
I'm talking about
how great the party was.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.725
I mean, saving Trish's life
was fantastic also.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:04.428
Anyways, I'd like to take you

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.530
and your little friend Ned
out shopping.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.698
You really do need
a decent outfit.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.239
What happened?

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:16.506
It was a lively party.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.775
Almost everyone
had a good time.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:19.976
I take it you're
Nancy's father.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.378
That's right.

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:24.048
We responded to a
complaint from a neighbor.

01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:25.149
Dad, this is
Sergeant Billings.

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.316
No, no, no.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.952
Let me say something.

01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:30.220
You had a wild party.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.690
You blew it out
when Dad was MIA,

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.993
damage was done,
things went amuck, I get it.

01:06:39.063 --> 01:06:41.931
Congratulations.

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.967
Getting rowdy is
part of being a normal,

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:46.036
non-sleuthing teenager!

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:47.271
(laughs)

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.575
All right, that's a first.

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:57.247
(laughs)

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.050
* All I need is the beat *

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.086
* To keep this party live *

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:04.588
* All I need is the beat *

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:06.856
* To keep it jumping, yeah *

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.159
Hi. Obviously,
someone here

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.727
needs a little help
with their look.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.796
Oh, it's not that bad.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:15.199
Oh, please,
it's a fashion teardown.

01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:16.600
You have some nice pieces,

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.369
they're just not really
working together.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.071
Me?

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.806
I was talking about her.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:25.575
Oh, sorry.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:26.410
Wow!

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:27.844
Where did you get that dress?

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:29.213
(gasps)

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:31.115
Um, I made it,

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:33.350
from one of my
mother's patterns.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.184
Oh!

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:36.120
It is just darling.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.154
I love the sincerity.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.356
I have to take your picture.

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:40.890
INGA:
Uh, you know what?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.561
I just remembered how much
I really hate this store.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.630
Excuse me?

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.931
(weak laugh)

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:50.800
I wish you could
stay longer.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.237
My mom said if I stayed
past the weekend

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.004
that she'd turn my
room into a den.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.373
Really?

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:58.842
Anyway, Nancy,
I just want you to know

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.145
that I'm not interested
in that Inga person.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:04.548
In fact, she scares me.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:08.552
And that if you like
this Porky guy...

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:09.419
Corky.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.921
...it's all right with me.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.990
Ned, he's 12.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.060
You just seem to really like
having him around.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.929
Ned, can I ask you a question?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.198
Mm-hmm.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.732
Can you tell
when a girl looks at you

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:24.401
and is thinking how much
she likes you and wondering

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:25.702
if you like her but thinking
how important it is

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.237
for you to say
how you feel before she says

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:28.572
anything more about
how she feels about you

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:30.207
or anyone else
that you might be jealous of,

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:32.341
because she's already saying
how she feels in her own way?

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.479
Can you repeat the question?

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.883
Your cab's here.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:42.852
Sorry to see you go, Ned.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:45.488
I'll, uh, see you soon.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.529
Bye, Ned.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.341
* *

01:09:12.316 --> 01:09:13.517
(melodic beeps)

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.554
(knocking)

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.729
Jane, are you
all right?

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:27.029
No.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.698
Child Protective Services,
they, um, they took her.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.567
They took Allie.

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:32.801
They said I was
an unfit parent,

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.970
but it isn't true.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.139
I didn't do any of the things
that they said.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.341
Come in, come in.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.314
You're always able
to help people.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.015
Well, I can certainly try.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.984
Why don't you come downtown
with me tomorrow morning.

01:09:47.984 --> 01:09:49.018
I will.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.086
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:09:50.086 --> 01:09:51.755
CARSON:
Sure.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.557
What's the connection?

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:54.791
How did you two meet?

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:01.265
I'm... Dehlia Draycott's
daughter.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:04.334
You're what? Wait...

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:06.370
Dad, it's so late.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.472
Jane's tired and so am I.

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:10.206
Let's go over all this
in the morning,

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.641
in the promising light
of a new day.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.377
Right.
Have you been sleuthing?

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.712
Dad, do you really think
I've been sleuthing?

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.113
That's not answering
my question.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:18.582
You're not answering mine.

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:20.016
Your what?
What?

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:21.150
What?
What?

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.952
(groans):
I'm going to bed.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:25.021
(sighs)

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.790
Good night.

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:31.928
Listen, I have
to tell you something.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.497
Right after
you first found me,

01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:36.032
someone came
to my apartment-- a man.

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:37.801
He said if I ever
tried to prove

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.703
that I was Dehlia's daughter
that I would regret it.

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:41.971
That's why I was afraid
to talk to you that time.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.341
What did he look like?

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:47.176
He was big...

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:51.147
um... dark hair...

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.349
scary.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.519
And he had one

01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:58.888
pale blue eye
and one very, very dark.

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:06.396
(crickets chirping, owl hooting)

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.303
(ominous theme playing)

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.610
Someone has filed
grievances against you,

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.346
but I don't
know who yet.

01:11:22.346 --> 01:11:25.214
But it isn't true;
none of it happened.

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:27.951
How can they just take a kid
away from its mother?

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:28.785
I believe you.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.253
And I think a
judge will, too.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:31.721
It just takes time.

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:34.391
We'll get her back,
I promise you.

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:36.760
Now... is
there anyone

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.928
who might have
something against you?

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:42.866
Dad, look, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:44.434
It has to do with
this whole...

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:46.336
(church bells ringing)
Carson!

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:48.405
Nancy.

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:49.639
After Jane's little revelation,
I found out

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.107
who the lawyer
for the estate was,

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:52.576
and I gave
him a call.

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:55.044
He and I are going to talk over
something privately.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.145
Do you have your car?

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.914
Down the block.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:58.948
What are you two, um...?

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.384
Dinner, tonight.

01:12:00.384 --> 01:12:01.685
I've got a lot of questions,

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:04.588
and I think you just
might have the answers.

01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:09.292
(sighs)

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:11.561
Feel like some hot cocoa?

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.565
(TV playing softly)

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.169
ANNOUNCER: ...Channel presents
the life and death

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.571
of Dehlia Draycott.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.139
JANE: It's so weird--
I never used to think

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.709
about her at all, and now
it's like I see her everywhere.

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:28.077
(reporters clamoring,
cameras clicking)

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.514
(thunder rumbling)

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:33.383
What if I am
an unfit mother?

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:34.618
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing.

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.885
No one ever taught me
what to do.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:36.820
Jane...

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.354
Nancy, I don't think
you understand

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.390
what it's like growing up
without a mom.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.594
Actually, my mother died
when I was very young.

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:47.363
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.132
I didn't know.

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:52.636
You've been so nice to me.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:57.073
Sometimes, I-I think
I can remember her,

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:59.676
but I never know
if what I'm remembering

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:02.412
is something I saw
in a picture...

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:04.548
or is just made up.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.250
She's, um...

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:10.487
she's a mystery.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:17.627
DEHLIA (on TV): Someone in
the village told me that

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.663
the will is in
the Chinese box.

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.636
Wait a minute.

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:36.946
What are we looking for?

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.815
A clue.

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:41.284
DEHLIA (on TV):
It's empty.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.019
You must make the dragon bow.

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:48.191
(lever squeaking)

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:56.232
The will.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:58.201
I must have fallen asleep
and heard this dialog.

01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:59.636
I finally found it.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:01.971
Dehlia used a clue from
one of her own movies

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.707
to show someone
where to find the will.

01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:05.909
Now all I have to do
is make the dragon bow.

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:08.211
Okay, you lost me at "dragon."

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.547
I'll be back later!

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:14.283
Hello?

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.785
Hello, Mr. Louis?

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.055
Are you in there?

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.724
Hello?

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:23.960
I'm sorry to
interrupt your dinner,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.229
but this means so much
to two of my friends.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.231
It's fine.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.804
(squeaking)

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:40.877
It's the will.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.049
If you want it,
you can have it.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:49.485
Thank you so much.

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:54.223
"I give all my property
and assets to my daughter,

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:57.226
born July 28, 1981."

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.262
I knew it.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:00.263
(sirens blaring in distance)

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.501
(auto-dial beeping)

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.536
(line ringing)

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:07.571
Dad.
CARSON: Hi, honey.

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:08.772
I have to talk to you.

01:15:08.772 --> 01:15:10.106
What number are
you calling from?

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:12.275
My cell phone--
the one you gave me.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:13.743
I didn't give you a cell phone.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.945
(beeping quietly)

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.552
CARSON:
Honey...?

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:24.320
Dad, I have to get off
this phone.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.421
Everything's fine.

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:26.422
I'll see you tonight.
Nancy...

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:27.891
(tires screech, phone beeps off)

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:30.694
(gasps)

01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:32.929
(muffled screams)

01:15:34.798 --> 01:15:36.532
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.613
* *

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.557
(light clattering)

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.203
* *

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:26.349
* *

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:40.529
* *

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:43.800
(whispering): So they're the
ones who've been breaking in.

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.172
* *

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.784
(snoring)

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.791
(television playing softly)

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.993
(board creaks quietly)

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.666
MAN (on TV):
They've got to stop.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.768
It's not your fault.

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:23.106
WOMAN (on TV): You do
believe me, don't you?

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.974
(creaking)

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.416
(creaking)

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:46.896
* *

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:00.176
* *

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.416
(loud thump)

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.452
Go check on her.

01:18:09.452 --> 01:18:11.454
Wait, I want
to see this part.

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:14.457
Kids will love it just
for making chocolate pasta.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.104
* *

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:56.099
(sighs)

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.044
(loud thump)

01:19:16.886 --> 01:19:19.455
* *

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.065
* *

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.305
She's not there.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:38.741
Look again.

01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:40.409
She's not there.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.115
(creaking)

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:48.584
(clattering)

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:50.453
Excuse me.
Hey!

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:54.390
Go get her!

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.434
Hey!

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:10.874
Hey!

01:20:10.874 --> 01:20:13.042
(truck engine accelerating)

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.378
She's getting away! Jump!

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:18.381
I don't...
Go! Go get the car!

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.149
Idiots!

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.027
(engine revving)

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:42.271
(tires screeching)

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.315
(gasps)

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:56.019
(car horns blaring)

01:20:56.019 --> 01:20:57.220
(screams)

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.560
(tires screeching)

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.929
(Nancy grunts)

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:10.833
(SUV speeding off
into distance)

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.468
NURSE:
Right there.

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.738
(phones ringing,
people conversing)

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:16.705
Hi, Dad.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:17.706
Are you okay?

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.042
What happened?

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:21.877
Just your run-of-the-mill
car accident.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.612
I swerved out
of control

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.149
because, um...

01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:28.251
because men were chasing me.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.119
I've been working on a case.

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:31.754
Uh, I'm going to
give you two some time.

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:33.923
Thank you.

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:35.858
I started to tell you today.

01:21:35.858 --> 01:21:37.560
You could have been killed.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.627
Do you realize that?

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.930
I was just trying
to do the right thing.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:43.299
This is a very dangerous city.

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.901
The world is not like
River Heights.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.170
I know.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.138
I mean, I tried to be normal.

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:50.806
I really tried.

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:54.343
I just start working on
something and... I can't stop.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:56.980
Wonder where you got that from.

01:21:58.614 --> 01:22:02.318
I mean, the idea of a girl
out there without her mom...

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:05.054
Dehlia wanted
to leave Jane

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:07.290
the estate,
and I found the will.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:10.359
Like you always
say, others first.

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:13.029
I just wish you had talked
to me about this.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.697
It'll be okay, Dad.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.399
We'll work it out.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:17.433
You're my guy.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.035
(scoffs)

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.836
(knocking)
Hey, kiddo.

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:21.904
Mr. Biedermeyer.

01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:25.074
Uh, your father and I were
going over some business

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:26.009
when we heard.

01:22:26.009 --> 01:22:27.977
I hope you're all right.

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:29.312
I'm fine.

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:30.879
Good.

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:32.015
He's offered me
some consulting work,

01:22:32.015 --> 01:22:33.349
and I can do it from home,

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:36.219
so we can go back
to River Heights.

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:38.387
(whispering):
And he pays a lot.

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:40.656
Oh.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.863
You know, I couldn't
help but overhear before

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:48.964
about the mystery.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.599
Did you ever
find the will?

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:51.800
I did.
Hmm.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.769
Dehlia used one of
her movies as a clue.

01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:55.371
(chuckles):
Oh.

01:22:55.371 --> 01:22:58.174
It was hidden in a secret
compartment of a Chinese box.

01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:01.177
Nancy always gets
to the bottom of things.

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:02.478
Well, my firm
would certainly be

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:04.480
interested in
seeing that will.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.251
You know, Mr. Biedermeyer wasn't
always just Dehlia's lawyer.

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:10.953
He was her manager,
as well, from the start.

01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:12.455
He made her who she was.

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:13.456
Oh.

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:14.690
(chuckles)

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:17.560
Then he brought her account
to his law firm and, uh...

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.064
Well, it's time to sign
on the dotted line.

01:23:21.064 --> 01:23:22.798
(chuckles)

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:24.233
Eh...

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:28.003
That's, uh,

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.073
quite a signature.

01:23:30.073 --> 01:23:31.440
It's my middle initial--

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.641
for Zachary.

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:34.310
(quietly):
Z...

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.411
Hmm?

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:39.482
(flashbulbs popping,
crackling softly)

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:48.124
Where is the will?

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:53.196
Um...

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:57.666
Where is it, honey?
Do you know?

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:02.405
You know, uh,
this is a little awkward.

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:05.174
His firm stands to lose
more than a little income

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:08.644
if the money from the will
really does go to Jane.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:12.948
(quietly): Dad, we have to
get out of this car now.

01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:14.417
Why?

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:17.220
Uh, excuse me, sir,
can you please stop the car?

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:22.791
Nancy!

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.665
(tires squealing)
Nancy!

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:34.370
Dad, get away from them!

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:39.408
(jazzy theme playing)

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:43.312
(crickets chirping)

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:45.281
Excuse me, miss?

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:48.351
Oh, hello, honey!

01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:51.787
Ah. Uh, the phone's
over there, honey.

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:59.695
Sergeant Billings.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.930
Do you know if a man
named Doshel Biedermeyer

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:02.998
ever rented in this building?

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:05.168
No. No, he owns it.

01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:07.035
He owns the house
you're in, too.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:09.037
He's a very rich man.

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:11.307
(tires screeching)

01:25:11.307 --> 01:25:13.676
There she is!

01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:16.979
Uh... is there
a back door anywhere?

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.847
Yes, honey, right over there.

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:23.219
Tell Sergeant Billings
to send a car to the house.

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:26.322
(jazzy theme playing)

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.327
Get her!

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.630
Oh! Open up!

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.533
(banging on door)
Open up!

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.102
Break it down!

01:25:40.102 --> 01:25:42.205
Kick it in!

01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:46.909
(footsteps echoing)

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.282
(gasps)

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:55.384
Where's the will?!

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:57.920
I don't think
I should say.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.224
It's my insurance that
you won't hurt me.

01:26:01.224 --> 01:26:04.193
I'll squeeze it out of you.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.896
Tell me something first.

01:26:10.065 --> 01:26:12.868
I-I-I'm... I'm-I'm
just really curious.

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:14.069
Mm-hmm?

01:26:14.069 --> 01:26:16.171
Why did you kill Dehlia?

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.740
(quiet laugh)

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:22.077
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:23.579
She was gonna
quit the business

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:25.814
and run off
with that caretaker.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:27.716
He was the father.

01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:29.285
Whatever.

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:31.019
She was my only client.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.721
She was gonna fire me.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:36.559
I spent 20 years of my life
building up her career.

01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:37.893
I got mad; I reacted violently.

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:40.863
I felt kind of bad
about it for a while,

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:42.231
but I'm okay with it now.

01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:45.100
Leshing is Jane's father.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.370
Mm-hmm.
Does he know about the baby?

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.772
It doesn't matter!
Now, where is the will?

01:26:49.772 --> 01:26:52.441
I-It's right here.

01:26:54.477 --> 01:26:57.012
(Nancy grunts,
Biedermeyer groans in pain)

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:59.214
(shouts angrily)

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:04.119
(grunting)

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:06.689
Give me...
give me the will!

01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:08.691
Give...

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:12.595
(suspenseful theme plays)

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.599
(fierce grunt)

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:20.269
(panting)

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:30.313
* *

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.882
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Just do it.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:38.487
If you shoot me, it'll leave
all sorts of evidence.

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:40.489
(whispers):
Very messy.

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:44.927
(cracks knuckles)

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:49.498
Strangulation... leaves
a traceable handprint.

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.368
What do you suggest?

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:54.503
The best way to kill me?

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:56.539
Hmm, let me think
about that. Um...

01:27:56.539 --> 01:27:59.375
Enough of this crap.

01:28:00.309 --> 01:28:02.144
Put the gun down.

01:28:02.144 --> 01:28:03.011
Hey!

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.046
(grunts)

01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:15.157
NANCY'S VOICE:
I'm just really curious.

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:17.993
Mm-hmm?
Why did you kill Dehlia?

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:22.831
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:24.567
She was gonna quit
the business and...

01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:25.968
Oh, my God, Nancy!
Nancy!

01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:27.169
(Biedermeyer groans)

01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:28.837
Nancy!

01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:31.374
Oh, my God, you won't
believe what's happening!

01:28:31.374 --> 01:28:33.742
Hey, Mr. Biedermeyer!
Inga Weinstein.

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:35.478
I'm in water polo
with Courtney.

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:36.645
(sirens approaching)

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.347
Your granddaughter.

01:28:38.347 --> 01:28:41.484
(weakly):
Yeah, I remember you.

01:28:41.484 --> 01:28:44.219
Hey, Lurch, digging
a hole or something?

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:45.521
Here, okay,

01:28:45.521 --> 01:28:47.856
we had to show you this.
Oh, my goodness!

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:49.592
It's called
"The New Sincerity."

01:28:49.592 --> 01:28:51.560
INGA: Yeah, once again
I'm on the forefront.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.396
I see something
I think is cute,

01:28:53.396 --> 01:28:55.330
I start wearing it,
and in, like,

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:56.765
five seconds,
it's a total trend.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:59.802
Penny loafer fashion
moment! Ah! (giggles)

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:01.870
Oh, I need to
borrow that coat.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.171
(girls laughing)

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.508
Leshing, thank
you so much.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.445
You're welcome... Nancy.

01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.346
There's something
you should know.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.715
It's about Jane.

01:29:13.949 --> 01:29:15.651
She's your daughter.

01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:17.553
(girls chatting
in background)

01:29:17.553 --> 01:29:20.656
(footsteps approaching)
Uh, uh...

01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:22.391
Hey, hey, hey,
you with the shovel.

01:29:22.391 --> 01:29:23.559
(chatter continues)

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:25.661
It's him.
Have you seen my father?

01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:26.895
A party!
BARBARA: Nancy...

01:29:26.895 --> 01:29:28.697
Nancy, darling,
are you okay?

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.699
(indistinct chatter)
Oh, good, good.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:33.201
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, Mr. Drew.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.470
I was locked in a trunk.

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:35.538
What happened?
Are you okay?

01:29:35.538 --> 01:29:37.473
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:37.473 --> 01:29:39.475
Okay, let's get him up.

01:29:39.475 --> 01:29:41.009
All right,
easy, easy, easy.

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:44.613
Looks like, uh, my new job
might not work out now.

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:46.782
Yeah, maybe not.

01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:49.518
So, wh-what
exactly happened?

01:29:50.352 --> 01:29:53.321
Dad... do you
really want to know?

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:54.690
Yeah.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.592
Uh...

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.894
Do I?

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:03.966
* ...Honor to love you *

01:30:05.367 --> 01:30:08.537
* Still I wonder why *
(chuckles)

01:30:08.537 --> 01:30:09.872
* It is *

01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:13.976
* I don't argue like this *

01:30:13.976 --> 01:30:16.378
* With anyone *
I don't know what to say.

01:30:16.378 --> 01:30:18.847
* But you *

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:25.220
* We do it all the time *

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:29.224
* Blowing out my mind *

01:30:29.224 --> 01:30:34.196
* You got this look
I can't describe *

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:35.764
* You make me feel *

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.700
* I'm alive *

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.103
* When everything else
is au fait *

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:45.908
* Without a doubt
you're on my side *

01:30:45.908 --> 01:30:50.378
* Heaven has been away
too long *

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:53.482
* Can't find the words
to write this song *

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:56.752
* Of your love *

01:30:59.622 --> 01:31:02.825
* Still I wonder why... *

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:06.729
Nancy, I... I want you
to know I appreciate

01:31:06.729 --> 01:31:08.430
how hard it was...

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:10.999
for you to do
the right thing.

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:15.437
But I'm very proud of you.

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:18.974
* We do it all the time *

01:31:20.342 --> 01:31:23.946
* Blowing out my mind *

01:31:23.946 --> 01:31:26.649
You know, Barbara Barbara Realty
would be delighted

01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:29.251
to continue to rent
this property for you.

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:30.753
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:31:30.753 --> 01:31:32.955
Well-well, what are you
gonna do with this place?

01:31:32.955 --> 01:31:35.457
I'm gonna to live here
with my kid

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:37.459
and anyone else
who needs a place.

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:39.227
Oh, well, I think
maybe you and I

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:41.496
should talk this
over before you...

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.498
Feel free
to leave at any time.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.968
* ...Understand the way it is *

01:31:45.968 --> 01:31:48.737
(scoffs)

01:31:48.737 --> 01:31:52.340
* It's not a secret anymore *

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.944
* 'Cause we've been
through that before *

01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:58.480
* From tonight I know *

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:02.585
* That you're the only one *

01:32:02.585 --> 01:32:05.120
* I've been confused *

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.755
* And in the dark *
JANE: Allie!

01:32:06.755 --> 01:32:10.659
* Now I understand *
Allie, come here!

01:32:10.659 --> 01:32:13.461
* Yeah, yeah *

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.297
* *

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:17.600
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:22.938
* Ooh, ooh, ooh... *

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:26.274
(sighs)

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:29.778
* I wonder why it is *

01:32:29.778 --> 01:32:34.650
* I don't argue like this *

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:37.953
* With anyone but you *
(sighs)

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:41.223
There it is,
just like clockwork.

01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:42.591
What?

01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:44.192
Postpartum depression.

01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:47.295
You're sad the
case is over.

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:50.866
That's ridiculous.
I'm glad it all worked out.

01:32:50.866 --> 01:32:54.269
You're only happy
when there's trouble.

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:56.404
This I know for sure.

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:58.974
But... that's
who you are,

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:00.876
and it's all right
with me.

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:03.178
Ned, that's so sweet.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:04.847
* *

01:33:04.847 --> 01:33:06.749
(birds chirping)
* Just like *

01:33:06.749 --> 01:33:09.885
* A star across my sky *

01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:13.055
* Just like an angel
off the page *

01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:17.292
* You have appeared
to my life... *

01:33:17.292 --> 01:33:19.127
CARSON: Nancy!
Yes?

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:21.664
Phone call--
long distance from Scotland.

01:33:21.664 --> 01:33:23.699
Something about
the Loch Ness Monster

01:33:23.699 --> 01:33:26.601
and some... missing diamonds.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:28.837
Another case!

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:31.974
(pop intro plays)

01:33:42.484 --> 01:33:44.586
* Love don't come *

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:47.622
* So easily *

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.892
* This doesn't have to end *

01:33:49.892 --> 01:33:53.361
* In tragedy *

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.430
* I have you *

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:58.133
* And you have me *

01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:01.003
* We're one and a million *

01:34:01.003 --> 01:34:04.372
* Why can't you see? *

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:07.142
* I'm waiting,
waiting for nothing *

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:09.878
* You're leaving,
leaving me hanging *

01:34:09.878 --> 01:34:12.314
* When did your heart
go missing? *

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:15.517
* When did
your heart go missing? *

01:34:15.517 --> 01:34:17.953
* I treat you like a princess *

01:34:17.953 --> 01:34:20.956
* But your life
is just one big mess *

01:34:20.956 --> 01:34:23.826
* When did your heart
go missing? *

01:34:23.826 --> 01:34:26.428
* When did
your heart go missing? *

01:34:26.428 --> 01:34:28.430
* Yeah *

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:38.640
* I meant *

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.110
* Every word I said *

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.780
* I never was lying *

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.983
* When we talked in bed *

01:34:47.983 --> 01:34:50.018
* I'm retracing *

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:53.055
* Every step in my head *

01:34:53.055 --> 01:34:55.457
* What did I miss back then? *

01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:58.093
* I was so, so misled *

01:34:58.093 --> 01:34:59.194
* Oh *

01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:01.563
* I'm waiting,
waiting for nothing *

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:04.366
* You're leaving,
leaving me hanging *

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:07.102
* When did your heart
go missing? *

01:35:07.102 --> 01:35:10.138
* When did
your heart go missing? *

01:35:10.138 --> 01:35:13.075
* I treat you like a princess *

01:35:13.075 --> 01:35:15.343
* But your life
is just one big mess *

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:18.546
* When did your heart
go missing? *

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.849
* When did
your heart go missing? *

01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:25.954
* I don't understand *

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:28.623
* How could you *

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:31.860
* Forget *

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.498
* What we had? *

01:35:36.498 --> 01:35:38.801
* It's so wrong. *

01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:50.012
(song ends)

01:35:50.012 --> 01:35:52.580
(fast-tempo intro plays)

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.784
* Looking out
a dirty old window *

01:35:55.784 --> 01:35:58.120
* Down below,
the cars in the city *

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.056
* Go rushing by *

01:36:01.056 --> 01:36:03.826
* I sit here alone *

01:36:03.826 --> 01:36:06.228
* And I wonder why *

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:10.398
* Friday night
and everyone's moving *

01:36:10.398 --> 01:36:13.701
* I can feel the heat,
but it's soothing *

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.971
* Heading down *

01:36:15.971 --> 01:36:18.573
* I search for the beat *

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:20.008
* In this dirty town *

01:36:20.008 --> 01:36:22.710
* Downtown,
the young ones are going *

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:25.914
* Downtown, the young ones
are growing *

01:36:25.914 --> 01:36:27.916
* We're the kids in America *

01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:29.051
* Whoa *

01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:30.718
* We're the kids in America *

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:32.187
* Whoa *

01:36:32.187 --> 01:36:35.790
* Everybody live
for the music-go-round *

01:36:37.893 --> 01:36:40.495
* Bright lights,
the music gets faster *

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:42.998
* Look, boy,
don't check on your watch *

01:36:42.998 --> 01:36:46.101
* Not another glance *

01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:49.571
* I'm not leaving now, honey *

01:36:49.571 --> 01:36:52.440
* Not a chance *

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.076
* Hotshot *
* Shot! *

01:36:54.076 --> 01:36:55.944
* Give me no problems *

01:36:55.944 --> 01:36:58.713
* Much later, baby,
you'll be saying *

01:36:58.713 --> 01:37:01.283
* Never mind *

01:37:01.283 --> 01:37:03.618
* You know life is cruel *

01:37:03.618 --> 01:37:05.020
* Life is never kind *

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.923
* Kind hearts
don't make a new story *

01:37:07.923 --> 01:37:10.926
* Kind hearts
don't grab any glory *

01:37:10.926 --> 01:37:12.861
* We're the kids in America *

01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:13.996
* Whoa *

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:15.898
* We're the kids in America *

01:37:15.898 --> 01:37:17.365
* Whoa *

01:37:17.365 --> 01:37:20.068
* Everybody live
for the music-go-round *

01:37:20.068 --> 01:37:23.038
* La, la, la-la, la-la *

01:37:23.038 --> 01:37:24.873
* La, la, la-la, la *

01:37:24.873 --> 01:37:25.941

01:37:25.941 --> 01:37:28.911
* La, la, la-la, la-la *

01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:31.947
* La, la, la-la, la *

01:37:35.017 --> 01:37:37.986
* Come closer, honey,
that's better *

01:37:37.986 --> 01:37:40.822
* Got to get
a brand-new experience *

01:37:40.822 --> 01:37:43.158
* Feeling right *

01:37:43.158 --> 01:37:46.694
* Oh, don't try to stop, baby *

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.830
* Hold me tight *

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:52.800
* Outside,
a new day is dawning *

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.205
* Outside, suburbia's
sprawling everywhere *

01:37:58.406 --> 01:38:02.044
* I don't want to go, baby *

01:38:02.044 --> 01:38:04.812
* New York
to East California *

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:08.050
* There's a new wave coming,
I warn ya *

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:10.018
* We're the kids in America *

01:38:10.018 --> 01:38:11.153
* Whoa *

01:38:11.153 --> 01:38:12.921
* We're the kids in America *

01:38:12.921 --> 01:38:14.389
* Whoa *

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:17.025
* Everybody live

01:38:17.025 --> 01:38:19.995
* La, la, la-la, la-la *

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:21.896
* La, la, la-la, la *

* La, la, la-la, la *

01:38:43.986 --> 01:38:45.687
* We're the kids *

01:38:45.687 --> 01:38:46.921
* We're the kids *

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:50.092
* We're the kids in America! *

01:38:50.092 --> 01:38:51.359
* We're the kids *

01:38:51.359 --> 01:38:52.961
* We're the kids *

01:38:52.961 --> 01:38:56.198
* We're the kids in America! *

01:38:56.198 --> 01:38:57.599
* We're the kids *

01:38:57.599 --> 01:38:59.001
* We're the kids *

01:38:59.001 --> 01:39:01.803
* We're the kids in America! *

01:39:01.803 --> 01:39:03.338
* We're the kids *

01:39:03.338 --> 01:39:04.806
* We're the kids *

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:08.343
(fading out):
* We're the kids in America... *
