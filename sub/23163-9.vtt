WEBVTT

00:00.033 --> 00:02.695
I'm sure you'd rather wait for
your investigator to get here.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.051
She's here.

00:05.056 --> 00:08.514
I could hardly ignore a
telegram from a dear old friend

00:08.592 --> 00:10.719
saying that someone
was trying to kill her.

00:13.297 --> 00:15.663
<i>If Jessica needs help,
then you're hired,</i>

00:15.733 --> 00:17.291
<i>for muscle, mop-up...</i>

00:17.368 --> 00:18.892
Muscle?
Magnum...

00:18.970 --> 00:20.665
<i>I'm sorry,
but I'm not available.</i>

00:20.738 --> 00:22.501
Even for twice your normal rate?

00:22.573 --> 00:24.131
Look out! Get down!

00:25.343 --> 00:26.810
Good luck
with your investigation.

00:26.877 --> 00:29.072
Thanks. Good luck
with your next novel.

00:29.146 --> 00:30.135
Thank you.

02:04.327 --> 02:07.490
<i>Echoes of Ecstasy. Mr. Masters
had hoped to complete it</i>

02:07.563 --> 02:09.622
in time to be here
for your arrival.

02:09.699 --> 02:12.395
But he feels confident that
he'll finish the final pages today

02:12.468 --> 02:14.595
and leave Greece this evening.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.604
<i>Echoes of Ecstasy?</i>

02:16.672 --> 02:17.832
What's wrong with it?

02:17.907 --> 02:19.966
<i>Oh, nothing, as a title
for a soap opera.</i>

02:20.042 --> 02:23.443
But it hardly heralds
quality prose.

02:23.513 --> 02:25.947
<i>Serpent's Whisper.
That was his best title.</i>

02:26.015 --> 02:28.643
Thank you.
I suggested that.

02:28.718 --> 02:32.518
<i>You know, Robin was gonna call
that one Valley of the Vipers.</i>

02:33.055 --> 02:35.114
<i>Pamela, I thought
we'd have tea at the estate</i>

02:35.191 --> 02:37.159
before I deliver your friends
to their hotel.

02:37.226 --> 02:38.420
<i>Oh, good.</i>

02:38.494 --> 02:41.258
<i>Joan, please, will you
cancel that reservation?</i>

02:41.330 --> 02:43.059
I didn't talk you
into making this trip

02:43.132 --> 02:45.327
just so you'd hole up
at some hotel.

02:45.401 --> 02:47.995
<i>Darling, please,
don't start in again.</i>

02:48.471 --> 02:51.440
Just meeting Robin Masters
will be quite enough.

02:51.507 --> 02:53.099
Amy and I
wouldn't want to impose.

02:53.176 --> 02:54.666
<i>Oh, don't be silly.</i>

02:54.744 --> 02:57.872
Robin would want my friends
to stay there with me.

02:57.947 --> 02:59.209
<i>Right, Jonathan?</i>

02:59.849 --> 03:00.838
No.

03:02.118 --> 03:04.450
He can't possibly pass here.

03:36.118 --> 03:38.177
I just can't jump
into something that risky.

03:38.254 --> 03:39.278
Risky?

03:39.355 --> 03:41.448
<i>Thomas, my friend Ron
works for the hotel chain.</i>

03:41.524 --> 03:43.355
He guarantees me
that they're gonna make a bid

03:43.426 --> 03:45.587
on the whole Makali Pua
Valley within a month.

03:45.661 --> 03:47.652
People go to Maui
for the beaches.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.130
Why would anybody build
a hotel that far inland?

03:50.199 --> 03:52.759
<i>Who cares? The point is,
it's gonna triple in value</i>

03:52.835 --> 03:54.564
once they make the bid
overnight.

03:54.637 --> 03:56.605
<i>Yeah, but when it doesn't,
I'm stuck with the payments</i>

03:56.672 --> 03:58.572
<i>on a $10,000 loan.
I'm sorry.</i>

03:58.641 --> 04:01.804
<i>Come on, Thomas. Look, T.C. And
I are committed to this deal.</i>

04:01.877 --> 04:04.505
We can't swing it by
ourselves. You gotta help us.

04:04.580 --> 04:05.979
<i>Oh, Rick...</i>

04:08.951 --> 04:12.250
<i>Okay, maybe I'll go along, but only
'cause you two guys are my friends</i>

04:12.321 --> 04:13.811
and you need a third partner.

04:13.889 --> 04:16.050
I guess I can talk
to the bank next week.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.315
Today.

04:17.392 --> 04:19.361
We're leaving for Maui
in the morning.

04:19.428 --> 04:22.192
Tomorrow? I can't qualify
for a loan that fast.

04:22.265 --> 04:23.926
I hadn't thought of that.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.729
I guess you can't qualify
at all.

04:25.801 --> 04:27.063
<i>Yes, I can. I'm just...</i>

04:38.347 --> 04:40.008
<i>Hi, Higgins.</i>

04:40.383 --> 04:44.376
<i>May I present Miss Pamela Bates,</i>

04:44.587 --> 04:47.647
<i>Mrs. Joan Fulton and her
secretary, Miss Amy Salyer.</i>

04:47.723 --> 04:50.624
<i>Jonathan, for God's sake, this
is no time for introductions.</i>

04:50.693 --> 04:52.593
<i>Joan, as soon as
I've made my call,</i>

04:52.662 --> 04:54.892
you phone the hotel and cancel.

04:54.964 --> 04:58.092
You and Amy are staying right
here until this matter is settled.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.931
<i>Pamela, I've had closer calls
in cabs on 7th Avenue.</i>

05:01.137 --> 05:02.934
Wait a minute.
What matter?

05:03.005 --> 05:04.199
<i>Yeah, what happened to the car?</i>

05:04.273 --> 05:06.639
<i>En route from the airport, we
were involved in an incident</i>

05:06.709 --> 05:08.904
with suspicious overtones.

05:08.978 --> 05:11.469
This is no time
to be euphemistic.

05:12.081 --> 05:14.311
Somebody just tried to kill us.

05:15.885 --> 05:17.819
It could have been deliberate
on the driver's part.

05:17.887 --> 05:20.048
<i>And then again, it could have
been an act of carelessness.</i>

05:20.122 --> 05:22.056
Maybe the driver
planned on being careless.

05:22.124 --> 05:24.718
I don't think that truck
had a license plate.

05:24.994 --> 05:26.461
It was a truck? What kind?

05:26.529 --> 05:30.056
<i>You got things to do,
remember? Don't get involved.</i>

05:31.467 --> 05:34.402
At least not until
we've been introduced.

05:35.304 --> 05:38.330
<i>Oh, Thomas Magnum.
This is Rick Wright.</i>

05:39.375 --> 05:42.208
<i>If you ladies will make
yourselves comfortable,</i>

05:42.278 --> 05:43.973
I'll arrange for your rooms.

05:44.046 --> 05:46.537
<i>Mrs. Fulton,
it would be safer here.</i>

05:47.316 --> 05:49.841
I guess we'll find out.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.081
I'll show you around.

05:57.693 --> 05:59.456
<i>Okay, Higgins. Let's have it.</i>

05:59.528 --> 06:00.654
Thank you.

06:00.730 --> 06:02.220
That's not what I meant.

06:02.298 --> 06:04.960
<i>Look, I know you don't want to
show concern in front of the ladies</i>

06:05.034 --> 06:06.194
before you get me
to take the case.

06:06.268 --> 06:08.600
<i>Yes, if you could take another
one, that would be most helpful.</i>

06:08.671 --> 06:10.434
<i>Oh, will you cut it out?
Why are you being evasive?</i>

06:10.506 --> 06:11.871
What really happened
out on that road?

06:11.941 --> 06:15.069
<i>It's a routine police matter, and I
can't understand why you or Pamela feel</i>

06:15.144 --> 06:17.977
that a private investigator
is needed.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.512
<i>Oh, Miss Bates wants to hire me.</i>

06:21.617 --> 06:23.983
It will only distress you
to continue this conversation.

06:24.053 --> 06:25.680
Distress me? Why?

06:26.589 --> 06:28.352
<i>Very well, if you insist,</i>

06:28.424 --> 06:30.392
<i>no one wants to hire you
for the case, Magnum.</i>

06:30.459 --> 06:32.893
Not Pamela and certainly not I.

06:36.165 --> 06:37.496
Excuse me.

06:41.604 --> 06:44.869
<i>My Aunt Mildred should have
been in the diplomatic corps.</i>

06:44.940 --> 06:47.170
<i>She was a master
of reverse psychology.</i>

06:47.243 --> 06:50.770
<i>Whatever she wanted you to do,
she'd forbid you to do it.</i>

06:51.714 --> 06:55.081
<i>I'd learned that Higgins was
no slouch at the art, either.</i>

06:55.151 --> 06:56.584
<i>Telling me that I wasn't wanted</i>

06:56.652 --> 06:59.280
<i>was supposed to make me
come begging.</i>

06:59.755 --> 07:04.021
<i>And swallowing my pride might be
preferable to eating a big real estate loss,</i>

07:04.093 --> 07:07.392
<i>but it was a lot easier to lose
to Aunt Mildred than to Higgins.</i>

07:09.098 --> 07:10.531
<i>Forget it, Higgins.
It's too late.</i>

07:10.599 --> 07:12.863
I leave for Maui in 15 minutes.

07:13.436 --> 07:15.233
I only need five.

07:15.404 --> 07:17.929
I thought you'd still be in bed.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.304
<i>Mrs. Fulton,
I'm very busy.</i>

07:20.376 --> 07:22.139
Please call me Joan.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.376
Know any good beaches?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.445
We got a great one right here.

07:26.515 --> 07:29.678
I'd prefer one
with more men than Dobermans.

07:31.153 --> 07:34.987
<i>Well, I'm sure Higgins can arrange
for you to use the one at the Club.</i>

07:35.257 --> 07:37.054
Or maybe you could?

07:38.461 --> 07:40.554
<i>I'm sorry,
but I'm not available.</i>

07:40.629 --> 07:43.029
Even for twice your normal rate?

07:44.233 --> 07:47.327
Higgins told me you were
a private investigator.

07:47.403 --> 07:49.871
I thought you weren't concerned
about what happened yesterday.

07:49.939 --> 07:53.431
<i>I wasn't, but Pamela
can be very convincing.</i>

07:53.509 --> 07:55.238
<i>Yeah, I've noticed.</i>

07:57.980 --> 07:59.971
I love to watch men pack.

08:02.218 --> 08:04.277
<i>Look, all you have to do
is keep an eye on me</i>

08:04.353 --> 08:07.811
until Pamela's investigator gets
here and cleans up this mess.

08:09.892 --> 08:11.621
Until her what gets here?

08:12.695 --> 08:15.027
<i>Oh, damn.</i>

08:15.097 --> 08:17.065
Higgins hasn't told you?

08:18.300 --> 08:20.393
I wanted to spare you
further pain.

08:20.469 --> 08:22.903
<i>Pain? Higgins,
I never wanted the case.</i>

08:22.972 --> 08:25.270
I'm not sure
there even is a case.

08:25.341 --> 08:28.469
<i>Besides, this trip
is very important to me.</i>

08:28.744 --> 08:31.736
So does this big mainland
investigator have a name?

08:31.814 --> 08:34.214
<i>Pamela Bates prefers that
I not divulge the name,</i>

08:34.283 --> 08:35.750
and I must honor her request.

08:35.818 --> 08:38.809
<i>Miss Bates is a very old
friend of Mr. Masters,</i>

08:38.888 --> 08:41.413
the editor of some of
his earliest successes.

08:41.490 --> 08:43.788
Does that mean you don't
like her hiring this guy?

08:43.859 --> 08:45.326
You're just obliging her?

08:45.561 --> 08:46.585
Not at all. I...

08:51.333 --> 08:54.496
T.C. Is landing here again
without my permission.

08:54.570 --> 08:56.128
<i>Don't change the subject,
Higgins.</i>

08:56.205 --> 08:59.868
Since when am I incapable of
handling a simple auto accident?

08:59.942 --> 09:03.878
<i>Magnum, I regret to inform
you it may not be that simple.</i>

09:03.946 --> 09:05.937
<i>No, Higgins!
They could be after you.</i>

09:06.015 --> 09:08.609
<i>There were four people in
your car yesterday, remember?</i>

09:08.684 --> 09:11.676
You're grasping at straws. I'm not
going to ask you to investigate.

09:11.754 --> 09:12.778
I don't want you to.

09:12.855 --> 09:14.254
Then lift off immediately.

09:14.323 --> 09:15.950
Did you qualify?
No.

09:16.025 --> 09:18.186
<i>He means,
did I qualify for my loan?</i>

09:18.260 --> 09:21.388
<i>No, but I will. I only got
the application late yesterday.</i>

09:21.463 --> 09:22.725
Application?

09:22.798 --> 09:26.256
We just called our banks and
got ours approved by phone.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.469
<i>Well, I'm not as liquid
as you are.</i>

09:28.537 --> 09:31.734
<i>Jonathan, just what the hell is going on?</i>

09:32.007 --> 09:33.975
<i>Pamela Bates, Theodore Calvin.</i>

09:34.043 --> 09:36.068
<i>Pleased to meet you, Miss
Bates. Don't bet on it.</i>

09:36.145 --> 09:39.603
<i>Jonathan, just what kind of
security do you call this?</i>

09:39.682 --> 09:41.843
The killer could have been
in that chopper.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.784
<i>Miss Bates, T.C. Does
not hire out to killers.</i>

09:44.853 --> 09:47.151
<i>He and Rick are here to pick
me up for a business trip,</i>

09:47.222 --> 09:49.053
<i>which I am taking,</i>

09:49.124 --> 09:52.150
if you're sure you still have
someone else for the case.

09:52.227 --> 09:54.354
<i>Well, of course
I have someone else.</i>

09:54.430 --> 09:55.954
<i>I mean, look,</i>

09:56.031 --> 09:59.398
<i>I'm sure you do very well
as an estate security guard,</i>

09:59.468 --> 10:02.403
<i>but, well, I need
professional, competent help.</i>

10:05.541 --> 10:06.906
Where's Amy going?

10:06.976 --> 10:08.500
Shopping.
She asked for the Ferrari

10:08.577 --> 10:09.908
as Joan is not yet back
with the Audi.

10:09.979 --> 10:13.608
You mean you just handed them
both the car keys and said go?

10:13.682 --> 10:16.310
<i>They're not prisoners here,
Pamela.</i>

10:16.385 --> 10:18.979
God give me strength!

10:20.589 --> 10:22.216
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

10:23.392 --> 10:25.724
Let's go to Maui.

10:26.061 --> 10:29.053
<i>Higgins, if this investigator
didn't work out,</i>

10:29.131 --> 10:30.996
<i>you wouldn't be too proud
to call me, would you?</i>

10:31.066 --> 10:33.330
<i>For the last time,
Pamela doesn't want your help.</i>

10:33.402 --> 10:35.700
Now lift off!

10:38.807 --> 10:40.274
<i>Maui, Thomas.</i>

10:40.342 --> 10:42.708
<i>Just follow her
a little further.</i>

10:46.548 --> 10:48.015
<i>Hey, Thomas,
didn't you get the hint?</i>

10:48.083 --> 10:49.448
<i>Higgins said to stay out of it.</i>

10:49.518 --> 10:51.315
<i>Come on, Rick,
you saw Amy yesterday.</i>

10:51.387 --> 10:53.048
<i>She was too scared
to stay at a hotel.</i>

10:53.122 --> 10:55.022
<i>Now, all of a sudden,
she wants to go shopping?</i>

10:55.090 --> 10:56.580
<i>It's her business.
And speaking of business,</i>

10:56.659 --> 10:59.093
<i>what about the cash for
your part of the closing?</i>

10:59.161 --> 11:03.894
<i>Oh, I can't get the cash until I
show the bank a deed for collateral.</i>

11:07.302 --> 11:08.701
<i>She's going shopping
in an office?</i>

11:08.771 --> 11:10.136
<i>T.C., can you get closer?</i>

11:10.205 --> 11:12.696
<i>Listen, Thomas, if you
really think you can qualify,</i>

11:12.775 --> 11:14.834
<i>well, maybe I can advance you
your part of the down.</i>

11:14.910 --> 11:18.073
<i>Down. T.C., please,
can you set down?</i>

11:18.681 --> 11:21.309
<i>I'd rather set her down on Maui.</i>

11:52.114 --> 11:53.604
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

11:53.682 --> 11:56.742
<i>Okay, so maybe
I was still hoping</i>

11:56.819 --> 11:59.413
<i>that the big mainland
investigator was a myth,</i>

11:59.488 --> 12:02.582
<i>that maybe Higgins had pulled
the ultimate Aunt Mildred</i>

12:02.658 --> 12:04.421
<i>to get me on the case.</i>

12:04.493 --> 12:08.088
<i>Or maybe I was beginning to believe
that there really was a case.</i>

12:08.163 --> 12:11.894
<i>Or maybe I just wanted
an excuse not to go to Maui.</i>

12:28.717 --> 12:30.116
Miss Salyer?

12:44.133 --> 12:46.260
<i>If he can afford
to buy land on Maui,</i>

12:46.401 --> 12:50.132
why does Robin let him
loaf around here rent-free?

12:50.339 --> 12:53.365
<i>Pamela, I'm afraid you have
some misconceptions about Magnum.</i>

12:53.442 --> 12:56.707
<i>He's neither a loafer
nor a sponge, exactly,</i>

12:56.779 --> 12:59.407
and he isn't without merit
as an investigator.

13:00.082 --> 13:04.246
Fine. Good. I'm just glad
his merits are on Maui.

13:04.753 --> 13:05.742
Higgins.

13:05.821 --> 13:07.345
<i>Magnum, how did you get here?</i>

13:07.422 --> 13:10.721
I took the bus. Did Amy and Miss
Bates' investigator come back here?

13:10.793 --> 13:12.021
My what?

13:12.094 --> 13:14.187
The guy you hired to handle
this case. Was he tailing Amy?

13:15.731 --> 13:18.131
<i>Robin's Nest. Mr. Magnum, I don't
know what you're talking about.</i>

13:18.200 --> 13:19.827
My help hasn't even arrived yet.

13:20.536 --> 13:22.197
I saw somebody
take off after her.

13:22.271 --> 13:24.831
<i>Yes, yes, she's a guest here.
Did you get a license number?</i>

13:24.907 --> 13:26.431
<i>No, the car was too far away.</i>

13:26.508 --> 13:27.907
Brother.

13:27.976 --> 13:29.967
And you wonder why I don't
want you on this case.

13:30.045 --> 13:32.946
<i>Miss Bates, could we forget about
your opinion of me for the time being?</i>

13:33.015 --> 13:35.540
I think Amy could be
in real trouble.

13:36.552 --> 13:38.816
What a brilliant deduction.
That was the police.

13:38.887 --> 13:42.186
<i>The Ferrari has been found
abandoned, and there's no sign of Amy.</i>

13:42.257 --> 13:43.724
And you saw her?

13:43.792 --> 13:47.057
You could have saved her
and you just stood there?

13:47.129 --> 13:48.994
<i>Magnum, how could you?</i>

13:54.976 --> 13:57.376
<i>Look, I'm not supposed to
tell you anything, Magnum,</i>

13:57.438 --> 14:00.100
<i>except, "Go to Maui."</i>

14:02.009 --> 14:03.636
Does that mean something to you?

14:03.711 --> 14:06.578
<i>It means Pamela Bates is
giving the orders, as usual.</i>

14:06.647 --> 14:09.775
<i>Yeah, well,
she's the girl's next of kin.</i>

14:09.851 --> 14:10.943
Next of kin?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.145
<i>Sergeant, who's handling
the Amy Salyer case?</i>

14:13.221 --> 14:14.779
Me.

14:14.856 --> 14:17.950
<i>Oh, Pamela asked you to
handle it personally, huh?</i>

14:18.025 --> 14:20.721
<i>She doesn't want you
involved, and neither do I.</i>

14:20.795 --> 14:23.992
<i>Well, I'm involved, whether
anybody likes it or not, Browning.</i>

14:24.065 --> 14:26.192
I've been out all night
looking for Amy.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.292
Captain Browning.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.494
<i>Listen, you have your car back,</i>

14:30.571 --> 14:34.007
and I'm sure you can get another
girl. Just let us find this one.

14:34.075 --> 14:36.270
And what about the guy
who was following her?

14:37.211 --> 14:38.735
Who told you about him?

14:38.813 --> 14:40.007
I'm the one who saw him.

14:40.081 --> 14:42.879
I guess the next of kin
didn't bother to tell you that.

14:43.651 --> 14:46.586
She just said that the bum
that ID'ed the car

14:46.654 --> 14:49.088
was too inept
to get a license number.

14:50.391 --> 14:51.824
Captain?

14:55.930 --> 14:58.125
Captain Browning here.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.699
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

15:00.368 --> 15:01.926
<i>Oh, I understand.</i>

15:43.778 --> 15:45.939
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
Your door was open.</i>

15:46.013 --> 15:49.039
<i>I just wanted to call home, see
if maybe Amy had contacted them.</i>

15:51.586 --> 15:56.285
<i>Look, Captain, it's 6:00 a. M.
You wanna get some coffee?</i>

15:58.159 --> 15:59.751
<i>Get out, Magnum.</i>

16:00.428 --> 16:01.986
<i>If Amy Salyer
turns into a homicide,</i>

16:02.063 --> 16:04.896
<i>you can come back here and
buy Tanaka a whole breakfast,</i>

16:04.966 --> 16:07.332
<i>but me, you don't manipulate.</i>

16:08.870 --> 16:11.361
Thanks for letting me
use the phone.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.100
You didn't use it.

16:13.441 --> 16:15.170
<i>Not to call the estate, anyway.</i>

16:15.243 --> 16:17.905
<i>If you had, you'd have known
that was Pamela Bates</i>

16:17.979 --> 16:19.776
on the phone just now.

16:19.881 --> 16:21.371
Now her sister's missing.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.380
Her sister?

16:23.451 --> 16:26.045
<i>Joan wouldn't stay out
all night without phoning.</i>

16:26.120 --> 16:28.714
I guess you know your sister
better than anybody.

16:29.390 --> 16:30.584
Cute.

16:30.658 --> 16:32.956
<i>Amy's not my niece, either.</i>

16:33.027 --> 16:37.088
<i>Well, I just wanted to avoid all
those unimportant explanations.</i>

16:38.332 --> 16:41.199
<i>No, Miss Bates, I think you just
wanted to control the situation.</i>

16:41.269 --> 16:44.568
Either that or you don't want the
police to know much about your friends.

16:44.639 --> 16:49.269
<i>Mr. Magnum, I've asked you to
get lost as nicely as I know how.</i>

16:49.944 --> 16:53.971
And I believe you. And I believe I
know why you don't want me around.

16:54.048 --> 16:56.107
<i>And if you tell me the truth,
maybe I'll stay quiet.</i>

16:56.183 --> 16:57.741
<i>Now, what the hell
does that mean?</i>

16:57.818 --> 17:00.753
<i>It means that if Joan Fulton
had a book to promote,</i>

17:00.821 --> 17:02.220
this'd be a great way to do it.

17:02.290 --> 17:03.951
What a preposterous theory.

17:04.025 --> 17:05.685
Mrs. Fulton
is not even a writer!

17:05.760 --> 17:07.853
Then why does she have
a secretary with her?

17:07.929 --> 17:10.089
Her husband dropped dead
three months ago

17:10.164 --> 17:12.598
and left a business
for her to run.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.527
<i>Well, maybe Amy's the one
with the book to promote.</i>

17:16.604 --> 17:19.038
<i>Look, nobody's
promoting anything.</i>

17:19.106 --> 17:22.098
<i>And I refuse to stand here
defending my concerns,</i>

17:22.175 --> 17:24.770
not when there's real help
on the way.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.640
Why are you doing this?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.878
Why are you? I wanna know
this real help's name.

17:30.952 --> 17:33.477
<i>Pamela's investigator is one
of the finest in the field,</i>

17:33.554 --> 17:35.283
a renowned name in the
intelligence community.

17:35.356 --> 17:37.950
<i>Well, if he's so renowned, why
can't you tell me who he is?</i>

17:38.025 --> 17:40.050
I have a right to know
who's replacing me.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.358
You're not being replaced.
You were never hired.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.022
Maybe because
there never was a case.

17:46.968 --> 17:50.927
<i>If it eases your pain to believe
that, then by all means do so.</i>

17:59.246 --> 18:02.272
And by all means go to Maui.

18:05.619 --> 18:09.111
"Amy Salyer? She said to look
her up when I got to the Islands.

18:09.190 --> 18:11.590
<i>"Receptionist:
What was your name, sir?"</i>

18:11.659 --> 18:14.628
<i>"Response: Well, I kind of
wanted to surprise Amy."</i>

18:14.695 --> 18:16.629
"Can you tell me
how to reach her?"

18:16.697 --> 18:19.222
"Receptionist:
Please have a seat."

18:20.534 --> 18:22.832
<i>Then she called you,
Mr. Houston.</i>

18:22.903 --> 18:25.599
Transcription from the
reception area voice recorder.

18:25.673 --> 18:28.301
<i>Miss Salyer's told you that
she worked here, Mr. Magnum?</i>

18:28.376 --> 18:31.868
<i>Yeah, but I didn't expect to rate
the president of the company's help.</i>

18:31.946 --> 18:34.414
She's one of your top people?

18:35.416 --> 18:38.010
Cut it out and tell me
why you're here.

18:38.085 --> 18:40.519
Press?
Undercover police?

18:40.588 --> 18:42.715
<i>Well, I'm just here
to see an old friend.</i>

18:42.790 --> 18:46.988
<i>Tell me, does everything everybody
says here get written down or recorded?</i>

18:47.061 --> 18:49.052
<i>In Amy Salyer's case, yes.</i>

18:49.130 --> 18:50.392
My attorneys want a record.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.365
<i>I intend to go after the first
paper that prints a headline like,</i>

18:53.434 --> 18:56.028
"Pacisle Mystery Woman
Still Missing."

18:56.637 --> 18:59.435
<i>Well, maybe you should just
explain what she was doing here.</i>

18:59.507 --> 19:01.498
She's never been here.

19:01.909 --> 19:04.844
<i>But one idiot claims he saw
her run from this building,</i>

19:04.912 --> 19:06.937
and everybody
takes him seriously.

19:07.014 --> 19:08.481
She was here.

19:10.184 --> 19:11.811
You're the idiot?

19:15.723 --> 19:18.055
Can I talk
to your security guard?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.025
I saw Amy speak to him.

19:20.561 --> 19:22.791
<i>The police
already questioned him,</i>

19:23.130 --> 19:25.963
and he says that no one fitting
Miss Salyer's description

19:26.033 --> 19:27.660
came into Pacisle yesterday.

19:29.170 --> 19:32.606
<i>And I'm busy.
Goodbye, Mr. Magnum.</i>

19:37.011 --> 19:39.241
Yes?
Wait a minute!

19:42.917 --> 19:45.044
Did you ask your doctor
to call you here?

19:45.152 --> 19:46.141
Doc Ibold?

19:46.220 --> 19:47.209
I...

19:47.288 --> 19:49.654
Bold. B-O-L-D. May I?

19:53.427 --> 19:54.451
<i>Hi, Doc.</i>

19:54.528 --> 19:57.429
<i>Her dyphylline prescription
was phoned into Pill Box Drugs.</i>

19:57.498 --> 19:59.432
<i>She wants it delivered
to the Seaview Motel,</i>

19:59.500 --> 20:01.229
<i>room number 1.</i>

22:15.002 --> 22:18.597
You should've tried the
bathroom window. It was open.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.973
What are you doing in my room?

22:21.041 --> 22:22.440
<i>It's not yours.
Now, who are you,</i>

22:22.509 --> 22:24.477
and what do you want
with Amy Salyer?

22:24.545 --> 22:26.911
What are you doing in my room?

22:27.448 --> 22:28.506
Look out!

23:06.020 --> 23:07.282
Thanks.

23:23.971 --> 23:26.872
Your delivery
from Pill Box Drugstore.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.240
Very good.

23:31.278 --> 23:33.212
I'll bet you're the only private eye in town

23:33.280 --> 23:35.840
who knows that asthmatics
can't be without their medicine.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.508
<i>It's "private investigator,"</i>

23:37.584 --> 23:40.610
and my doctor asked his asthma
specialist friends to call him

23:40.688 --> 23:42.713
if you made contact.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.951
One of his golfing foursome
phoned in your prescription

23:45.025 --> 23:46.583
to Pill Box Drugs.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.151
Why'd I have to panic and
leave my dyphylline in the car?

23:49.229 --> 23:50.457
<i>Yes, Amy, why?</i>

23:50.531 --> 23:52.761
<i>Now, come on, you must have
some idea who this guy is.</i>

23:52.833 --> 23:54.562
I told you I don't.

23:55.469 --> 23:57.801
<i>Well, why'd you
run away from him?</i>

23:57.871 --> 24:00.101
<i>Well, because I dumped
my boyfriend.</i>

24:00.174 --> 24:01.641
I had this friend in New York.

24:01.709 --> 24:04.075
I just left without even
leaving a note or anything.

24:04.144 --> 24:07.978
And I think this man may be a
detective he's hired to bring me back.

24:09.550 --> 24:10.881
That's it?

24:12.019 --> 24:14.112
<i>For that, you went into hiding,</i>

24:14.188 --> 24:15.553
let everybody worry?

24:15.622 --> 24:16.646
Yeah.

24:16.724 --> 24:17.986
No.

24:18.058 --> 24:20.117
<i>Look, I just didn't plan
any of this.</i>

24:20.194 --> 24:23.095
You didn't plan to go
in the Pacisle offices?

24:23.163 --> 24:25.222
No. I was lost.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.824
I just stopped
to ask for directions.

24:27.968 --> 24:30.436
<i>Amy, you knew exactly
where you were going.</i>

24:30.504 --> 24:32.267
You were nowhere near
the shopping district.

24:32.339 --> 24:35.672
Amy! Oh!
Where did you find her?

24:35.743 --> 24:36.903
Find her?

24:36.977 --> 24:38.808
<i>Oh, I just happened
to run into Amy, Miss Bates.</i>

24:38.879 --> 24:41.074
<i>I mean, I wouldn't want you
to think I was on the case.</i>

24:41.148 --> 24:42.172
Mr. Magnum...

24:42.249 --> 24:43.238
<i>Incidentally,</i>

24:43.317 --> 24:46.514
I may have also run into the guy
who tried to run you off the road.

24:46.587 --> 24:47.952
<i>I got the license number
this time,</i>

24:48.021 --> 24:51.184
but I'm sure you'd rather wait
for your investigator to get here.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.254
She's here.

24:54.061 --> 24:55.221
She?

24:59.700 --> 25:00.997
She.

25:05.788 --> 25:07.187
J.B. Fletcher.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.553
I know J.B. Fletcher.

25:08.624 --> 25:10.023
<i>Well, I mean,
I know of J.B. Fletcher,</i>

25:10.093 --> 25:11.253
but I thought he was an author.

25:11.327 --> 25:14.353
<i>No, I mean, if you're the
J.B. Fletcher I know of,</i>

25:14.430 --> 25:16.125
I just didn't know
you were a woman.

25:16.199 --> 25:18.292
<i>That is, that he was a she,</i>

25:18.368 --> 25:20.529
and that she was also
an investigator.

25:22.672 --> 25:24.196
An investigator?

25:24.807 --> 25:28.174
<i>Mr. Magnum, I'm afraid you have
me confused with someone else.</i>

25:28.444 --> 25:30.810
<i>No, no,
he has his terms confused.</i>

25:30.880 --> 25:32.780
I said help was coming.

25:33.015 --> 25:34.710
Will everyone please excuse me?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.809
<i>It was very nice meeting you,
Mrs. Fletcher.</i>

25:36.886 --> 25:40.879
<i>Oh, yes, of course. I'm sure that
you've been through quite an ordeal.</i>

25:40.957 --> 25:42.891
<i>And I'm sure we haven't heard
all the details of it,</i>

25:42.959 --> 25:44.449
<i>right, Amy?</i>

25:44.527 --> 25:47.860
<i>Mr. Magnum, I have to speak to Jessica alone.</i>

25:47.997 --> 25:50.761
I know that you will find out

25:50.833 --> 25:54.735
<i>if Amy's little secrets have any real
bearing on the case, Mrs. Fletcher.</i>

25:54.804 --> 25:56.863
<i>Look, she just arrived.</i>

25:56.939 --> 25:59.203
We've hardly had time to talk.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.936
<i>Just a moment, Pamela.</i>

26:01.010 --> 26:04.946
<i>Mr. Magnum, I could hardly ignore
a telegram from a dear old friend</i>

26:05.014 --> 26:06.948
<i>saying that someone
was trying to kill her,</i>

26:07.016 --> 26:10.315
but I am certainly not here
to "work on a case."

26:10.386 --> 26:12.547
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26:14.490 --> 26:16.185
J.B. Fletcher.

26:16.793 --> 26:19.728
<i>Jessica, Jonathan Higgins.</i>

26:22.098 --> 26:24.225
<i>Oh, Mr. Higgins.</i>

26:24.734 --> 26:28.329
Forgive me.
I'm somewhat overwhelmed.

26:28.404 --> 26:30.463
Please forgive my appearance.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.303
<i>Oh, yes, of course.</i>

26:32.375 --> 26:36.243
<i>Cymbidiums always need care,
no matter what the crisis.</i>

26:36.312 --> 26:38.337
Extraordinary.
How did you know?

26:38.848 --> 26:41.612
<i>Well, it's obvious
that you have been working</i>

26:41.684 --> 26:43.618
<i>with a compound of hapu'u
and volcanic ash,</i>

26:43.686 --> 26:47.281
<i>which, incidentally, is an
excellent bed for cymbidiums.</i>

26:47.457 --> 26:49.925
I should have known that
you'd be a lover of flowers.

26:49.992 --> 26:53.223
<i>I think you should have known
a lot more than that, Higgins.</i>

26:53.296 --> 26:56.459
Miss Bates never mentioned
Mrs. Fletcher's name to you?

26:56.532 --> 26:57.692
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

26:57.767 --> 26:59.826
<i>Well, then, this must be
kind of a shock for him,</i>

26:59.902 --> 27:03.463
to finally learn the identity
of the big mainland investigator.

27:04.474 --> 27:07.238
<i>Pamela, what have you
been saying about me?</i>

27:08.277 --> 27:10.575
<i>Nothing, Mrs. Fletcher. Maybe
you shouldn't be in here.</i>

27:10.646 --> 27:13.672
You're dropping dirt
on the rug. Excuse me.

27:18.921 --> 27:21.947
<i>Mr. Higgins, is there
somewhere a bit more private</i>

27:22.024 --> 27:24.049
where Pamela and I
could go and talk?

27:24.126 --> 27:26.651
We have a little catching up
to do.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.219
Yes.

27:33.936 --> 27:37.872
<i>But, Jessica, I swear I never
called you an investigator.</i>

27:38.274 --> 27:41.437
<i>Well, perhaps not, but
apparently you inferred that I...</i>

27:41.511 --> 27:44.480
<i>Inferred. That's a good
word. Now, that's all I did.</i>

27:44.547 --> 27:48.005
I suppose Jonathan told
the bum P.I. All those lies

27:48.084 --> 27:49.449
just to keep him off the case.

27:49.519 --> 27:50.543
Keep him off?

27:50.620 --> 27:54.386
<i>Oh, Jessica, please,
I need a friend helping me.</i>

27:54.457 --> 27:57.824
<i>Pamela, I am here as your
friend, and that is all I am.</i>

27:57.894 --> 27:59.794
<i>But you need professional help,</i>

27:59.862 --> 28:02.990
and if this Mr. Magnum
is a P. I...

28:03.065 --> 28:04.464
He's a bum.

28:04.534 --> 28:05.933
Yes?

28:07.937 --> 28:09.700
I've arranged for a light lunch.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.104
Maine lobster salad
in honor of your arrival.

28:12.174 --> 28:14.472
<i>Oh, how very kind of you,
Mr. Higgins.</i>

28:14.544 --> 28:17.411
Will you ask Mr. Magnum
to join us?

28:23.786 --> 28:25.879
Heliconia seemed appropriate.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.652
<i>In the Fijis, it's the flower
presented to important visitors.</i>

28:29.725 --> 28:33.058
<i>Oh. Well, it's certainly
a lovely centerpiece,</i>

28:33.129 --> 28:35.393
<i>but are you certain
that we couldn't squeeze up,</i>

28:35.464 --> 28:37.125
make a little bit more room
at the table?

28:37.199 --> 28:40.066
<i>No, that would require a complete
resetting. Magnum understands.</i>

28:40.136 --> 28:42.934
<i>I'm fine, Mrs. Fletcher.
Really.</i>

28:43.005 --> 28:44.404
You wanted to talk to me?

28:44.473 --> 28:46.964
<i>Yes, about Pamela's problem.</i>

28:47.043 --> 28:49.477
Could you conduct
an investigation?

28:50.580 --> 28:52.047
<i>With all due respect,
Mrs. Fletcher,</i>

28:52.114 --> 28:54.309
I think that's what
you're supposed to do.

28:54.617 --> 28:56.585
<i>Yes, but wouldn't that be
a little ridiculous?</i>

28:56.652 --> 28:59.450
<i>I mean, with a private
investigator available,</i>

28:59.522 --> 29:00.614
why would you need me?

29:00.690 --> 29:02.089
<i>I mean, don't you agree, Pamela?</i>

29:02.158 --> 29:05.650
Well... What is this lead
you claim you have?

29:06.062 --> 29:07.154
Lead?

29:07.229 --> 29:10.198
You said earlier you thought
you knew who ran us off the road.

29:10.266 --> 29:11.790
Did I say that?

29:12.902 --> 29:19.137
I think that Mr. Magnum has a reason
for not wanting to reveal his clues.

29:20.276 --> 29:22.471
<i>Yes, Mrs. Fletcher, I do.</i>

29:22.545 --> 29:25.537
<i>I quite understand. I mean, after
all, it's your responsibility,</i>

29:25.615 --> 29:26.843
professionally.

29:26.916 --> 29:29.441
And I'm just so glad that
you're going to take the case.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.281
I'm not on the case.

29:32.388 --> 29:35.448
<i>Amy, what a lovely diamond.
May I see it?</i>

29:35.524 --> 29:36.991
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

29:37.627 --> 29:39.595
I just wish it was real.

29:40.630 --> 29:42.427
I'm not on the case.

29:43.165 --> 29:45.156
Are we still arguing that point?

29:45.234 --> 29:47.065
Where in hell have you been?

29:47.136 --> 29:49.764
<i>On the beach, more or less.</i>

29:49.872 --> 29:53.467
<i>Well, in your "less" periods,
couldn't you have called?</i>

29:53.542 --> 29:55.703
I've got the police
looking for you.

29:55.778 --> 29:58.246
<i>Pamela, I'm f... 39.</i>

29:58.314 --> 30:00.782
I'm an adult.
I don't need a babysitter.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.715
<i>Oh, this is Jason.</i>

30:04.220 --> 30:07.587
Jason Bryan.
Joan and I met on the beach.

30:08.391 --> 30:10.689
I'm sorry
to interrupt your lunch.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.160
Joan said it was urgent
that she stop by here.

30:13.229 --> 30:16.426
<i>What was so urgent, if you didn't
know anybody was looking for you?</i>

30:16.632 --> 30:19.032
I have been in these clothes
since yesterday.

30:19.602 --> 30:20.694
I doubt it.

30:21.103 --> 30:22.627
<i>Pamela, please.</i>

30:22.905 --> 30:26.306
May I present
Mrs. Jessica Fletcher.

30:26.876 --> 30:28.309
How do you do?

30:29.011 --> 30:31.172
<i>Well, I'm impressed.</i>

30:31.247 --> 30:32.680
<i>I came here to meet
a famous writer,</i>

30:32.748 --> 30:34.579
and I'm finally
getting to meet one.

30:34.650 --> 30:37.983
<i>Well, we're all so pleased
that you're safe, Mrs. Fulton.</i>

30:38.254 --> 30:41.052
You seem to have been spending a
great deal of time on the beach.

30:41.123 --> 30:42.750
Couldn't drag her away
yesterday.

30:42.825 --> 30:44.986
I'll arrange for more salads.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.062
<i>Well, I feel like
this is an imposition,</i>

30:47.129 --> 30:49.063
and I'd like to reciprocate
by inviting you all

30:49.131 --> 30:50.758
over to my place
at 5:00 today.

30:50.833 --> 30:52.562
I'm having
a little cocktail party.

30:52.635 --> 30:54.159
<i>Mr. Bryan, we appreciate
your invitation,</i>

30:54.236 --> 30:56.727
but Mr. Masters
is expected here this evening.

30:56.806 --> 30:59.104
<i>Yes, and you ladies
probably shouldn't go out</i>

30:59.175 --> 31:01.575
until Mr. Magnum
has solved the case.

31:01.644 --> 31:02.668
I'm not on the case.

31:02.745 --> 31:04.110
<i>Oh, yes, you are.</i>

31:04.180 --> 31:06.273
<i>If Jessica needs help,
then you're hired,</i>

31:06.348 --> 31:09.112
<i>for muscle, mop-up,
whatever.</i>

31:09.251 --> 31:11.378
Muscle? Mop-up?

31:11.587 --> 31:12.645
Magnum...

31:12.722 --> 31:14.246
<i>No, Higgins, that's it.</i>

31:14.323 --> 31:16.723
I have had it!
No more abuse!

31:16.792 --> 31:18.487
<i>Now, I have tried
to put up with it</i>

31:18.561 --> 31:20.825
because I thought there
might be a real problem here.

31:20.896 --> 31:23.023
<i>But if there is, nobody
wants to talk about it.</i>

31:23.099 --> 31:26.227
<i>Amy won't talk, Joan has
absolutely nothing to say,</i>

31:26.302 --> 31:28.827
<i>and you, Miss Bates, have
never even offered a reason</i>

31:28.904 --> 31:30.132
why somebody would
wanna kill you.

31:30.206 --> 31:32.003
And I'm the only one
who's been shot at!

31:32.074 --> 31:33.735
<i>Magnum, sit down and be calm.</i>

31:33.809 --> 31:35.606
<i>Higgins, stop treating me
like a child!</i>

31:35.678 --> 31:38.169
I'm an adult!
No more abuse!

31:38.547 --> 31:40.071
Look out! Get down!

31:41.517 --> 31:43.417
Is everybody all right?

31:44.120 --> 31:46.884
<i>Excuse me, please.</i>

32:01.303 --> 32:03.237
<i>It was foolish of me
to give her the code.</i>

32:03.305 --> 32:05.500
I should have realized she
might be irresponsible enough

32:05.574 --> 32:06.700
to leave the gates open.

32:06.776 --> 32:09.472
I wanna know why someone just
happened to be waiting there

32:09.545 --> 32:10.534
to follow them in.

32:10.613 --> 32:12.205
Perhaps they were tailed here.

32:12.281 --> 32:13.771
Or Amy and I were.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.044
<i>You know, Mayfield could
have had the place staked out.</i>

32:16.118 --> 32:17.107
Mayfield?

32:17.186 --> 32:18.710
The guy who was after Amy.

32:18.788 --> 32:21.985
He was driving a rental that was
booked out to a Paul Mayfield.

32:22.057 --> 32:25.220
<i>God, it's busy. And I can't
get ahold of Rick to find out</i>

32:25.294 --> 32:26.852
if he checked the address
or talked to Ice Pick.

32:26.929 --> 32:28.419
Why would he talk
to Mr. Ice Pick?

32:28.497 --> 32:31.057
<i>Higgins, Mayfield
or whoever took the shot</i>

32:31.133 --> 32:32.395
knew exactly what he was doing.

32:32.468 --> 32:34.368
<i>In and out quick, no traces.</i>

32:34.436 --> 32:35.835
A professional assassin?

32:37.306 --> 32:38.796
<i>Magnum,
your performance at lunch</i>

32:38.874 --> 32:42.435
leads me to feel that I and not
you should pursue this matter.

32:42.578 --> 32:45.979
What hotel were Amy and Joan
staying at originally?

32:46.048 --> 32:47.709
The Royal Hawaiian.
Did you hear what I said?

32:47.783 --> 32:49.080
Please remain off the case.

32:49.151 --> 32:52.484
<i>Fine, I'll take it. But maybe you
shouldn't discuss this with Mrs. Fletcher.</i>

32:52.555 --> 32:55.046
It's getting too messy
for amateurs.

32:56.592 --> 32:59.823
Are you kidding? We're talking
minimal risk. Beautiful flowers.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.422
<i>Why, that's what Makali Pua
means, Thomas, beautiful flowers.</i>

33:03.499 --> 33:05.524
And the flowers here are great!

33:05.601 --> 33:08.900
<i>Why, Thomas, in the long run, we can't lose.</i>

33:09.138 --> 33:12.596
Long run? You said the land
would triple in value in a month.

33:12.875 --> 33:15.105
It will if the hotel chain
makes a bid.

33:15.177 --> 33:16.166
If?

33:16.245 --> 33:19.772
<i>Look, Thomas, other happy investors
have to get on the phone now.</i>

33:19.849 --> 33:21.248
I gotta get off.

33:21.317 --> 33:24.343
<i>Look, T.C. And I put up
your down payment.</i>

33:24.420 --> 33:25.853
<i>Rick, what about Mayfield?</i>

33:25.921 --> 33:29.084
<i>Yeah, he got a place here.
Swanky joint, too.</i>

33:29.558 --> 33:31.992
<i>Now, Thomas,
did you get the loan?</i>

33:32.127 --> 33:33.856
Did you talk to Ice Pick?

33:33.929 --> 33:36.124
No! Come on.

33:36.198 --> 33:38.223
<i>Thomas, you cannot do this
to Rick and me.</i>

33:38.300 --> 33:40.825
<i>I mean, we signed the contract
before we saw the land.</i>

33:40.903 --> 33:43.337
<i>What's wrong with it?
T. C., you level with me.</i>

33:43.405 --> 33:44.963
Tell me about this property.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.098
<i>What's to tell?</i>

33:47.076 --> 33:49.840
<i>Like Rick said,
beautiful flowers.</i>

33:50.546 --> 33:53.572
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, I'll let
you know if I qualify.</i>

33:53.649 --> 33:54.741
When?

33:54.817 --> 33:56.910
When Rick talks to Ice Pick.

33:56.986 --> 33:59.420
<i>Thomas, wait a minute.
You can't... Thomas?</i>

33:59.855 --> 34:01.823
<i>Come on in, Joan.</i>

34:02.191 --> 34:05.558
<i>Oh. Oh, my goodness. Well,
with everything going on,</i>

34:05.628 --> 34:07.892
isn't this a rather strange
time to take a shower?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.623
<i>Well, not when
you smell like wine.</i>

34:09.697 --> 34:11.359
<i>Oh. Did you want something, Mrs. Fletcher?</i>

34:11.433 --> 34:15.995
<i>Well, I thought I might have some things
that could help you with this case.</i>

34:16.572 --> 34:17.596
What case?

34:17.672 --> 34:18.731
<i>Oh, please, Mr. Magnum,</i>

34:18.806 --> 34:20.399
things are beginning
to get serious.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.070
That bullet could have
killed one of us.

34:23.145 --> 34:27.081
So you have some little things
that might help find the gunman?

34:27.149 --> 34:31.245
<i>Well, not exactly, just things
that don't quite make sense.</i>

34:31.320 --> 34:32.786
<i>I mean, for instance,</i>

34:32.855 --> 34:36.313
Joan said that she spent all
of yesterday on the beach.

34:36.391 --> 34:39.020
<i>Well, why wasn't her skin
more flushed?</i>

34:39.094 --> 34:40.425
Sunscreen.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.795
<i>Oh, nothing could block the sun out
for that number of hours, Mr. Magnum.</i>

34:43.866 --> 34:46.801
And what about Amy
lying about her ring?

34:47.168 --> 34:48.636
<i>I mean, she said it was a fake,</i>

34:48.704 --> 34:51.605
but I noticed that it was
an exceptionally fine stone.

34:51.674 --> 34:53.835
Why does Amy lie about anything?

34:53.909 --> 34:56.275
<i>Yes, and what is
her marital status?</i>

34:56.344 --> 35:00.338
<i>I noticed, for instance, that
the tan line on her ring finger</i>

35:00.416 --> 35:03.408
was wider than the diamond band.

35:03.485 --> 35:05.578
<i>Now, what does that
indicate to you?</i>

35:05.654 --> 35:07.952
That her diamond casts a shadow.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.987
<i>Look, Mrs. Fletcher,
all we know for sure</i>

35:10.059 --> 35:12.118
is there's a potential
murderer running around.

35:12.194 --> 35:15.095
<i>Now, I think it would be best
if you let me,</i>

35:15.931 --> 35:19.298
<i>a competent professional,
look for him or her.</i>

35:23.005 --> 35:24.563
Good luck
with your investigation.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.074
Thanks. Good luck
with your next novel.

35:27.142 --> 35:28.632
Thank you.

35:29.345 --> 35:31.370
<i>Everybody, deep down inside,</i>

35:31.447 --> 35:34.780
<i>thinks he or she
is a private investigator.</i>

35:34.850 --> 35:36.647
<i>Jessica Fletcher
was no exception.</i>

35:36.719 --> 35:39.586
<i>Despite her denials, I was
sure that she fancied herself</i>

35:39.655 --> 35:42.647
<i>as the consummate crime solver.</i>

35:42.725 --> 35:45.057
<i>I had to admit
that she had good instincts,</i>

35:45.127 --> 35:46.924
<i>but diamonds and tan lines,</i>

35:46.996 --> 35:48.861
<i>while interesting observations,</i>

35:48.931 --> 35:50.922
<i>were not germane to the case.</i>

35:51.000 --> 35:52.627
<i>I mean, it's okay for a novelist</i>

35:52.701 --> 35:55.499
<i>to use non-germane clues
in the literary process,</i>

35:55.571 --> 35:58.131
<i>but the criminologist
has to have clues</i>

35:58.207 --> 36:00.767
<i>with a relativity
to the relative.</i>

36:01.243 --> 36:03.234
<i>Well, you know what I mean.</i>

36:03.312 --> 36:05.803
<i>Thomas? I talked to Ice Pick.</i>

36:05.881 --> 36:07.712
<i>So call me
when you get your loan.</i>

36:07.783 --> 36:09.341
<i>The deal's getting better
all the time.</i>

36:09.418 --> 36:11.181
<i>We get the flowers for nothing.</i>

36:13.122 --> 36:15.886
This establishes the trajectory.

36:17.393 --> 36:20.021
The bullet passed
right over this table.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.690
<i>Yes, where I had stood
only seconds before the shot.</i>

36:23.766 --> 36:27.202
Are you suggesting that
someone was trying to kill you?

36:28.303 --> 36:30.635
<i>I have a colorful past, Jessica,</i>

36:30.706 --> 36:33.174
with enemies who might well
deploy a professional assassin

36:33.242 --> 36:35.506
to take their vengeance on me.

36:35.811 --> 36:38.644
<i>Sorry, Higgins. Your theory's
only half right. Where's Joan?</i>

36:38.714 --> 36:39.942
What?

36:40.015 --> 36:41.846
<i>Oh, she and Amy
went to Mr. Bryan's party.</i>

36:41.917 --> 36:43.680
<i>We tried to dissuade them,
but...</i>

36:43.752 --> 36:45.185
<i>Well, you should have
tried harder.</i>

36:45.254 --> 36:46.687
A guy matching
Mayfield's description

36:46.755 --> 36:50.020
was at the Royal Hawaiian
yesterday looking for Joan.

36:50.092 --> 36:53.459
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, but you can't
presume that she was a target</i>

36:53.529 --> 36:55.292
just because someone
was looking for her.

36:55.364 --> 36:57.594
<i>Mrs. Fletcher,
guys like Mayfield</i>

36:57.666 --> 36:59.258
only look people up
for one reason.

36:59.334 --> 37:00.631
I think he's
a professional hit man.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.636
He must have a contract
to kill Joan.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.993
<i>Mr. Higgins, ladies, I'm
glad you could make it.</i>

37:21.071 --> 37:23.232
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

37:25.176 --> 37:26.643
Mr. Masters
not flying in tonight?

37:26.710 --> 37:27.734
No.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.440
He deems it necessary
to remain in Greece.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.542
<i>Mr. Bryan, where is Joan?</i>

37:32.616 --> 37:33.640
Hmm?

37:33.717 --> 37:35.981
<i>Oh, well,
she's around someplace.</i>

37:36.053 --> 37:39.318
<i>Now, the bar is over that
way. Just enjoy yourselves.</i>

37:40.324 --> 37:42.053
<i>Party, party.</i>

37:42.259 --> 37:44.250
I cannot believe
we are doing this.

37:44.328 --> 37:45.989
<i>Pamela, please,
I could hardly leave</i>

37:46.063 --> 37:49.328
two women alone on the
estate after today's attempt.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.300
I'll be back shortly.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.195
<i>Pamela, let's try and find Joan.</i>

37:54.271 --> 37:55.260
Yes.

38:00.978 --> 38:03.208
<i>Jessica, this is ludicrous.</i>

38:03.747 --> 38:05.840
What if the killer is here?

38:05.983 --> 38:08.952
I might just as well walk
up and ask him to murder me.

38:09.019 --> 38:11.544
<i>Pamela, what is it
that you haven't told me?</i>

38:12.256 --> 38:13.245
What?

38:13.357 --> 38:15.689
<i>Well, you seem convinced that
somebody wants to kill you,</i>

38:15.759 --> 38:17.090
<i>you personally,</i>

38:17.161 --> 38:20.221
and yet you haven't given
any reason for thinking that.

38:20.698 --> 38:23.258
<i>Please, Pamela,
you have to tell me</i>

38:23.334 --> 38:25.768
why you're so frightened.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.871
<i>Magnum, perhaps I was rash
in agreeing to this plan.</i>

38:31.942 --> 38:33.876
You have no real proof
about Mr. Mayfield.

38:33.944 --> 38:36.344
<i>Come on, Higgins, I explained.</i>

38:36.413 --> 38:38.973
Ice Pick says Mayfield
is a well-known hit man

38:39.049 --> 38:40.175
with a very clean image.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.549
Just the type Arthur Houston
would hire to do his dirty work.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.281
And you believe
he's trying to murder Joan

38:44.355 --> 38:46.084
simply because she wants
to own her company?

38:46.156 --> 38:49.387
<i>Well, it makes sense. Pacisle's registered
five bids since her husband died.</i>

38:49.460 --> 38:50.688
I checked with the SEC.

38:50.761 --> 38:54.026
<i>And Mr. Houston, unable
to persuade Joan to sell,</i>

38:54.298 --> 38:57.131
has decided to eliminate her and
simply negotiate with her estate?

38:57.201 --> 38:59.135
Right. When he found out
he couldn't scare her...

38:59.203 --> 39:01.671
<i>With the car incident, yes.</i>

39:01.739 --> 39:04.833
And you theorize that Amy
Salyer was at Pacisle yesterday

39:04.909 --> 39:06.809
<i>to deliver Joan's final refusal,</i>

39:06.877 --> 39:08.902
and so he decided to take
more drastic action.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.812
It's not a theory. Joan
would already be dead if...

39:11.882 --> 39:14.908
If Mayfield had known
her whereabouts.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.284
And you speculate that he was following
Amy in order to find his target.

39:18.355 --> 39:20.915
Speculate? He followed Amy
and me to the estate.

39:20.991 --> 39:22.652
<i>He saw Joan go in,
he took a shot.</i>

39:22.726 --> 39:25.194
There's no speculation about it.

39:26.830 --> 39:29.196
I suppose the theory
is plausible.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.924
Good.
I'm glad you understand.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.798
<i>Now, will you go back in,
stay with Joan</i>

39:32.870 --> 39:35.839
until I can catch Mayfield
making his move?

39:35.906 --> 39:38.306
We haven't found Joan as of yet.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.399
We?

39:39.476 --> 39:41.706
I had no choice but to bring
Jessica and Pamela with me

39:41.779 --> 39:43.747
in order to go along
with your plan.

39:43.814 --> 39:45.907
I now realize
that that was folly.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.280
Their lives will be
in danger again

39:47.351 --> 39:50.013
when the assassin
makes another attempt on me.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.111
On you?

39:51.188 --> 39:53.748
You said you understood.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.815
You agreed that Mayfield
was after Joan.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.224
<i>I did not agree,</i>

39:57.294 --> 39:59.455
and I understood your theory
the first time around.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.020
I said it was plausible.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.588
<i>But as usual,
you're basing it on a hunch</i>

40:02.666 --> 40:04.224
rather than
on deductive reasoning.

40:04.301 --> 40:07.293
Higgins... I shall give Mr.
Mayfield 30 minutes to arrive

40:07.371 --> 40:08.998
and make an attempt on someone

40:09.073 --> 40:11.405
before taking the ladies home.

40:13.611 --> 40:16.011
<i>That's the last place
I'd wanna go right now.</i>

40:16.313 --> 40:19.749
You have to go back to New
York and deal with it. Tomorrow.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.216
No.

40:21.318 --> 40:24.151
Do you realize
we're talking about millions?

40:24.555 --> 40:27.991
<i>Pamela, do you have proof that
he's been embezzling the royalties?</i>

40:28.058 --> 40:31.459
<i>Well, I took some
very incriminating papers</i>

40:31.528 --> 40:33.553
I found in his sock drawer.

40:33.664 --> 40:37.100
Please don't ask me why I was
looking in his sock drawer.

40:37.167 --> 40:40.625
<i>Look, all I ask is that you
go back and talk to the police.</i>

40:40.704 --> 40:41.762
Talk?

40:41.839 --> 40:44.740
You think they'd take my word
over a powerful publisher?

40:44.808 --> 40:46.673
Yes. You have proof.

40:46.744 --> 40:49.406
<i>No, I'd never get there.</i>

40:50.047 --> 40:52.242
<i>Pamela, you asked for my help,</i>

40:52.316 --> 40:53.749
and that's what
you're gonna get.

40:53.817 --> 40:56.285
<i>Now, you and I are going to
take the first flight to New York</i>

40:56.353 --> 40:57.411
tomorrow morning.

41:26.383 --> 41:27.407
Paul.

41:27.484 --> 41:28.508
Jason.

41:28.585 --> 41:29.745
Good to see you.
Arthur.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.947
<i>Paul. Come on, I'll get you a drink.</i>

41:32.022 --> 41:34.513
<i>So tell me, Paul,
how's Molly these days?</i>

41:34.591 --> 41:35.580
Fine.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.319
Jonathan.

41:38.395 --> 41:39.987
<i>Mrs. Fletcher,
I was getting concerned.</i>

41:40.064 --> 41:41.122
Have you seen Pamela?

41:41.198 --> 41:44.099
<i>Yes, and I'm afraid
we're going to have to leave.</i>

41:44.535 --> 41:45.661
Leave?

41:45.736 --> 41:47.363
<i>Why, how long
have you been here?</i>

41:47.438 --> 41:49.929
Glad you changed your mind about
coming. Anyone else with you?

41:50.007 --> 41:51.838
<i>Everyone.
Joan, where have you been?</i>

41:51.909 --> 41:53.308
<i>I've searched the house,
the grounds...</i>

41:53.377 --> 41:55.311
I've been around.

41:55.379 --> 41:58.473
Will everyone stop acting
like I need a keeper?

42:00.617 --> 42:02.551
<i>I think you better
stay with her, Jonathan,</i>

42:02.619 --> 42:04.416
just in case
Mr. Magnum is right.

42:04.488 --> 42:07.787
Pamela and I can take a taxi back
to the estate. We have packing to do.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.052
Packing?
I don't understand.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.423
I'll explain later.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.158
<i>Pamela! Pamela,
I've called a taxi.</i>

42:15.399 --> 42:16.388
Pamela?

42:16.467 --> 42:17.491
<i>She isn't here,
Mrs. Fletcher.</i>

42:17.568 --> 42:20.128
<i>Oh, yes, so I see.</i>

42:23.741 --> 42:25.538
What are you doing?

42:26.510 --> 42:28.978
I'm trying to keep an eye on
Mayfield without him seeing me.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.513
Did Higgins find Joan yet?

42:30.581 --> 42:33.448
<i>Yes. If you don't mind
my making a suggestion,</i>

42:33.517 --> 42:36.816
I have a hunch that it's Amy who
may be in some kind of trouble

42:36.887 --> 42:38.377
and not Joan.

42:39.490 --> 42:40.479
Uh...

42:41.091 --> 42:44.185
I don't play hunches. I stick
to logic and deductive reasoning.

42:44.928 --> 42:47.897
<i>Oh, and it's logical to think
that this man is after Joan,</i>

42:47.965 --> 42:49.762
when you found him
following Amy?

42:49.833 --> 42:53.234
<i>Yes, because he was
following Amy to get to Joan.</i>

42:53.303 --> 42:54.930
<i>Relativity, Mrs. Fletcher.</i>

42:55.005 --> 42:57.735
That's the kind of knowledge that
makes me a private investigator

42:57.808 --> 42:59.639
<i>and you a novelist,
and a very good one.</i>

42:59.710 --> 43:00.699
Thank you.

43:00.944 --> 43:03.811
I'm sure that normally you're
very good at what you do.

43:03.881 --> 43:06.645
<i>Well, I'm afraid I have to
say goodbye and find Pamela.</i>

43:06.717 --> 43:07.706
Goodbye?

43:07.785 --> 43:10.151
<i>Yes, we're leaving
for New York in the morning.</i>

43:10.220 --> 43:11.744
<i>Well,</i>

43:12.289 --> 43:14.416
good luck on your next novel.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.460
<i>Oh, and good luck
on your next investigation.</i>

43:17.528 --> 43:18.517
Yeah.

43:19.196 --> 43:20.254
Wait!

43:20.330 --> 43:23.094
<i>Mrs. Fletcher,
we may have a problem.</i>

43:23.167 --> 43:24.964
<i>Could you please call the
police, tell them to hurry,</i>

43:25.035 --> 43:26.161
and then get Joan out of sight?

43:26.236 --> 43:27.863
<i>Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you.</i>

43:53.831 --> 43:57.164
<i>All right, Mayfield,
come on out. Come on.</i>

44:03.106 --> 44:04.095
<i>Hey, what...</i>

44:16.286 --> 44:17.981
<i>Jessica, please, stay behind me.</i>

45:24.997 --> 45:27.731
I took Jessica and Pamela to the airport.

45:28.687 --> 45:30.153
Jessica sent you this,

45:31.076 --> 45:34.194
with her congratulations and apologizes.

45:35.271 --> 45:36.271
How thoughtful?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.059
Houston confessed?

45:39.493 --> 45:40.693
Late last evening.

45:43.050 --> 45:45.549
I must appear quite the fool to Jessica.

45:45.574 --> 45:49.355
I'm sure she's just relieved that
your theory was wrong, Higgins.

45:53.525 --> 45:56.613
Maybe more relieved than you realized.

45:56.868 --> 45:59.160
She does say wonderful things about you.

46:01.602 --> 46:04.168
There's also an article on page 4a

46:04.225 --> 46:05.225
that should be of interest to you.

46:05.247 --> 46:07.014
The Maui land deal was a hoax.

46:07.108 --> 46:09.286
Someone spread a rumor that
the hotel was buying acrage

46:09.293 --> 46:12.002
in order to rump the price of
some worthless land there.

46:12.158 --> 46:14.682
I know, but it's not worthless.

46:14.690 --> 46:16.490
We figured to get our money out eventually.

46:16.951 --> 46:17.951
We?

46:18.394 --> 46:20.874
You're still buying? But
you're not legally committed.

46:20.934 --> 46:22.489
I know but Rick and T.C. are.

46:22.565 --> 46:23.933
I made a commitment to them.

46:23.992 --> 46:26.530
Commitment is a very
important thing, Higgins.

46:26.685 --> 46:28.018
To a promise or a...

46:29.014 --> 46:31.241
to a feeling for another person.

46:31.307 --> 46:33.351
Sometimes you just have to...

46:33.380 --> 46:36.178
get in for the long haul
and see how it goes.

46:36.636 --> 46:37.703
Don't you agree?

46:40.933 --> 46:41.933
Quite.

46:42.663 --> 46:44.792
Actually, we figured we can form a co-op

46:44.807 --> 46:48.540
with some of the other investors
and promote the valley.

46:49.943 --> 46:52.737
I'm told the state of Maine
is beautful in summer.

46:53.677 --> 46:55.601
Perhaps I'll take my vacation there.

46:55.629 --> 46:58.919
The guys feel our acre just
needs some improvements.

46:59.013 --> 47:00.419
Excellent food.

47:02.569 --> 47:03.992
Maybe we can plant some more flowers.

47:04.035 --> 47:05.945
Turn it into a tourist attraction.

47:07.954 --> 47:10.152
Magnificent cymbidiums in Maine.

47:14.975 --> 47:17.255
In the proper season of course.
