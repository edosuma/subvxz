18:29.900 --> 18:30.859
- THANK YOU, BOYS.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
I OWE YOU A SOLID.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.238

18:34.321 --> 18:36.281
- WELL, THIS MONSTER
BETTER GET HIS BUTT BACK

18:36.365 --> 18:38.867
TO THE FROSTY MART,
OR I'LL BE OUT OF A J-O-B.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.952
YOU FEEL ME?

18:40.035 --> 18:41.411

18:45.833 --> 18:48.710
YOU ASK FOR BERRY,
AND I'LL HOOK YOU UP.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.088
- BUT WE WANT TO KEEP YOU
ALL TO OURSELVES.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.548
- WHAT?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.799
- [laughs nervously]

18:53.882 --> 18:56.885
HE MEANS KEEP YOU
FOR OBSERVATION.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.178
YOU COULD HAVE A RELAPSE.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.389
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STAY
FOR MORE TESTS.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.474
- WHY?
I FEEL FINE.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.725
I GOT MY COLOR BACK.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.395
I MEAN, COME ON;
LOOK HOW PINK THESE CHEEKS ARE.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.898
- OKAY, BUT, UM,
HERE'S THE THING.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.775
WE FOUND SOMETHING
ON YOUR X-RAYS.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.904
I THINK YOU BETTER SIT DOWN.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.950
AT FIRST GLANCE,
EVERYTHING LOOKS NORMAL.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.160
NICE ICICLE GROWTH,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.038
BUT YOU SEE THIS MARK THAT LOOKS
LIKE A FINGERPRINT SMUDGE?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.415
- WHAT IS IT, DOC?

19:26.498 --> 19:27.708
- THAT'S JUST IT.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.209
IT COULD BE NOTHING.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.711
THEN AGAIN, IT COULD BE...

19:30.794 --> 19:32.588
SOMETHING.
