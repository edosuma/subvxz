00:08.166 --> 00:11.417
: Ugh.

00:23.041 --> 00:25.291
-Sir, it's hard to concentrate.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.667
: Sorry, I'll just...

00:27.709 --> 00:30.208
Put it there so it's on a...

00:35.375 --> 00:38.583
: Oh, really? Pft.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.834
: So I take it?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.166
: Sheila: What?

00:59.208 --> 01:02.125
-No, I might need them.

01:13.709 --> 01:16.208
♪ I'm awesome, not your not dude, don't lie ♪

01:16.250 --> 01:18.875
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving around in my mom's ride ♪

01:18.917 --> 01:21.667
♪ I'm awesome, a quarter of my life gone by ♪

01:23.125 --> 01:25.166
♪ I'm awesome ♪

01:29.041 --> 01:31.250
-Oh God, this is awful.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.417
Trudy's band perform?

01:33.458 --> 01:36.291
: That was... That was good.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.792
-How 'bout I shove my band down your throat.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.959
-First of all, that's doesn't even make sense.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.458
How's a whole band supposed to fit down someone's throat?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.625
Although, I heard you tried to swallow your whole band.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.500
: That's two! "

01:48.542 --> 01:50.542
: Did you get that wig at the 99 cent store?

01:50.583 --> 01:53.667
: Constructive criticism is what it is.

01:53.709 --> 01:57.667
Ugh. This poor bus monitor being bullied by a bunch of horrid

01:53.709 --> 01:57.667
kids.

01:57.709 --> 02:00.000
-Look at that woman's hair.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.625
Big Bird called, wants his hairstyle back.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.375
: Okay, I am kidding. That is terrible, but let's...

02:07.417 --> 02:09.709
Be honest, her hair is low hanging fruit.

02:09.750 --> 02:13.041
: Nice hair, Big Bird.  The kids

02:09.750 --> 02:13.041
got it.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.208
: Big Bird, Big Bird.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.208
-Congratulations.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.417
You have the wit of a seventh grade moron.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.959
-Ha, ha, ha. -Oh at least it paid off for

02:17.458 --> 02:19.959
her.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.125
-The internet people felt sorry

02:20.000 --> 02:22.125
for her.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.792
So, they made a Kickstarter to raise money to send her on a

02:22.166 --> 02:24.792
trip.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.959
-There you go. Happy ending for Big Bird.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.667
It's already up to a hundred and fifty grand!

02:31.625 --> 02:33.959
That lady's gonna be rich from a few little insults?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.959
-You should be a billionaire.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.125
-Except her comments weren't deserved.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.291
-You like threesomes, so you shouldn't say anything.

02:40.333 --> 02:43.083
-Yeah, that is correct. -You're on fire, Gerry.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.250
-Heard ya tried to swallow your band.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.834
-Ahhh, again, not a rumour.

02:50.417 --> 02:53.834
-It sounds like one of your band members is stuck down there.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.291
: Four!

02:57.125 --> 02:59.291
-This is it Bobbi. You can do this.

02:59.333 --> 03:02.458
Moment of truth.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.458
Here we go.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.875
No. No, no, no, no, no.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.542
Ugh, it doesn't come off. No!

03:14.583 --> 03:18.709
Okay. Margin of error. "Over 99% accurate."

03:18.750 --> 03:22.041
One more time. Let's go again. Twelfth time's the charm.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.083
Here we go.

03:25.417 --> 03:27.709
No, not yet.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.959
-Oh my gosh. Wow. This is something.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.417
Malik, have you seen this? -I do not trust the liberal

03:30.000 --> 03:33.417
media.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.458
-Yeah, okay...Um...

03:35.500 --> 03:39.041
But, the police have released a sketch of the person who

03:35.500 --> 03:39.041
murdered Dwyer's wife.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.417
-Allegedly. -I can't imagine what he's going

03:39.083 --> 03:42.417
through.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.625
-No, no. This very unique situation.

03:47.667 --> 03:51.083
I was just saying, I can imagine.

03:51.125 --> 03:53.959
-Oh. -Poor Dwyer.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.250
-Poor Dwyer.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.709
She's very, very pretty though.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.875
: Mmm, yeah?

04:00.917 --> 04:03.166
-Seven years running.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.750
The best part of my day, ensuring the to and fro safety

04:03.208 --> 04:06.750
of those little ducklings.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.917
-I want to do it with you. -That's amazing!

04:08.959 --> 04:11.250
I'll finally have someone to sit next to.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.250
-I'm gonna make a fortune.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.583
-Ah, no. It's a volunteer position. I learned that

04:11.291 --> 04:14.583
the hard way.

04:16.792 --> 04:18.917
The monitor being picked on? Being bullied by the kids.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.208
-Tragic, oh. It was such a tragic tale.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.375
-Had an uplifting ending though, where she got that trip.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.917
But, then I heard she got food poisoning at the end of that

04:23.417 --> 04:25.917
trip, so...

04:25.959 --> 04:28.250
Real emotional roller coaster. -I'm gonna go on the bus...

04:28.291 --> 04:31.875
Get picked on, make hundreds of thousands of dollars, like she

04:28.291 --> 04:31.875
did.

04:31.917 --> 04:34.834
-Not the most ethical plan. -It's not about the money,

04:31.917 --> 04:34.834
Simon!

04:34.875 --> 04:38.709
It's about shining a light on bus monitor bullying.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.875
That's what I want us to do.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.959
-You're using the buzzwords I love to hear! Okay.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.959
-Okay.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.834
If it's about raising awareness, I am all in. Hook,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.834
line and sinker. I love it.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.083
-Make sure you bring your phone. Make sure it's charged.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.959
-Okay, I just need to close some games. They tend to eat up my

04:48.125 --> 04:50.959
battery.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.208
-Yeah, I got a class right now. I'm in the middle of class.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.417
-Closing these games.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.333
Jewel thief. Baby's First Bratwurst.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.375
Oh, Tinder. Mama's Boy.

05:01.417 --> 05:04.208
What the hell is this game

05:06.875 --> 05:09.834
-Come on! I eat lunch off this desk.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.917
-Babies are making babies.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.917
-That's a lot of positive tests. -I find these in garbage can.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.166
-I bet this is one of those pregnancy pacts that the

05:21.667 --> 05:24.166
kids are doing.

05:24.208 --> 05:27.291
I saw it on Dateline. -We need to find these girls,

05:24.208 --> 05:27.291
and we need to help them.

05:27.333 --> 05:31.709
Somewhere there are twelve scared pregnant little teens.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.750
-Or maybe there are just twelve pregnant teenagers

05:34.792 --> 05:37.083
that are just processing this whole thing.

05:37.125 --> 05:40.709
And they didn't realize Malik was going to be rifling through

05:37.125 --> 05:40.709
the garbage.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.834
And need to be left alone, just to figure things out on their

05:40.750 --> 05:43.834
own. Probably that.

05:43.875 --> 05:46.291
-Well, that's ridiculous.

05:46.333 --> 05:50.000
-Bobbi, as the Health teacher, I need you on the front lines

05:46.333 --> 05:50.000
with me.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.083
-But, I'm very busy Robert. -This is a crisis.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.750
We need to sniff out these pregnant little women.

05:55.792 --> 05:57.834
Let's roll!

05:58.375 --> 06:00.250
-Ohhh.

06:00.291 --> 06:03.375
-I bet Nick Davis is the baby-daddy to all of 'em.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.333
Just wanted to see how you're holding up.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.667
-Never been locked in a basement. Couldn't be better.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.709
-Yeah. Well, that's great. Ha.

06:20.750 --> 06:26.166
Still, it must be tough seeing the face of your wife's murderer

06:20.750 --> 06:26.166
on the news.

06:26.208 --> 06:29.875
-No doubt. But, I met a special lady. Life's good.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.792
-That's nice. -You know what they say:

06:31.834 --> 06:34.750
God takes one lady away from you and brings you another.

06:36.959 --> 06:40.583
-There she is, right there.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.333
: Hi.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.542
: She's real cool too.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.750
You good

06:50.792 --> 06:52.959
: Real good. Real good.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.667
-I'm just...I'm a colleague. I'm just a friend.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.750
I'm just...A plat... Platonic colleague.

06:58.792 --> 07:01.583
: Nisha, Donna. Donna, Nisha.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.750
-Nisha.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.750
It's so nice to meet you, Nisha. -Thank you.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.667
-What part of the city do you live in.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.750
-Oh...I moved. -Wait a minute, you're

07:08.709 --> 07:11.750
on Carlisle Street.

07:14.583 --> 07:17.208
: We'll talk.

07:22.583 --> 07:26.792
-If this is the last time we see each other I want you to know...

07:26.834 --> 07:29.375
I'm taking your parking space.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.834
-New bus monitor. New bus monitor.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.834
-And assistant. -Alright. Okay, let's go.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.125
: Oh, bus monitors usually sit at the front.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.709
: All the bad kids will sit at the back.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.417
Better chance. -Oohhh, nice! Nice.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.375
: Hi. Hey.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.792
: Hi, hi.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.125
-Okay, good. Put a little scare in them.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.041
Egg 'em on a little bit.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.834
I'm going to make fun of them, they're going to say something

07:55.083 --> 07:58.834
mean back...

07:58.875 --> 08:00.792
We're gonna focus on that, okay? -Yeah.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.208
-Okay. Okay.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.792
Here we go.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.792
-Rolling. Frame.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.667
-Here comes Laura. Laura, Laura, Laura.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.792
Hey Laura, nice pigtails! If you're five years old.

08:09.834 --> 08:14.500
: The queen of mean, the king of sting. Aw yeah.

08:14.542 --> 08:17.709
-Hey Lucas, Jordan Knight called. He wants his haircut

08:14.542 --> 08:17.709
back.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.667
-I don't know who that is...

08:19.709 --> 08:22.917
But I'm picking up from your tone that it's intended to be

08:19.709 --> 08:22.917
hurtful.

08:22.959 --> 08:26.917
-Congratulations. You succeeded.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.083
Forget this. I'm gonna walk home.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.834
: You ripped him. Run away, Jordan Knight!

08:31.875 --> 08:35.166
-This isn't working. These private school

08:31.875 --> 08:35.166
kids are too soft.

08:35.208 --> 08:39.166
-Yes Charlie, you are. Too soft.

08:39.208 --> 08:42.041
: Oh great, not you too. :You are killin' these

08:39.208 --> 08:42.041
kids.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.458
-No, actually.

08:44.500 --> 08:48.625
-Okay, well then stop videoing right now, 'cause it is not

08:44.500 --> 08:48.625
working.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.542
-Hey, look at this photo of Donna from Dwyer's Facebook

08:51.583 --> 08:54.542
page.

08:54.583 --> 08:57.583
How can he not see it: They are identical.

08:57.625 --> 09:01.333
Of course, all white people look the same to Malik so,

08:57.625 --> 09:01.333
hard to say.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.250
You too, might be murderer.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.875
-Boy, they do not teach you how to handle this in

09:03.291 --> 09:05.875
Teacher's College.

09:05.917 --> 09:09.041
If I tell him I could be ruining his one shot...

09:09.083 --> 09:11.542
At his second shot at love.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.458
-If you don't tell him...

09:13.500 --> 09:16.375
He might wake up in pool of his own blood.

09:16.417 --> 09:20.375
-It's a tough call. -Not really, but okay.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.542
: Are you sure this is gonna work?

09:22.583 --> 09:24.917
-Stick with the plan. This school doesn't use bus monitors.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.000
They let the driver's do it. -Mmm.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.667
-Here, throw these on. -Alright, cool.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.792
-Cool as a cucumber. Here we go. -Yeah, I'll say.

09:31.834 --> 09:34.083
-Here we go. Alright.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.500
Act like we own this. -Own it.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.875
-We own this school. Whoo, we got this, we got this,

09:37.542 --> 09:40.875
we got this.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.041
: We got this. Let's lock and load.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.667
What the hell is that? -Oh, it's so we don't get

09:46.417 --> 09:48.667
recognized.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.208
-Honestly Gerry, I'm a little bit confused.

09:53.250 --> 09:56.375
: I told you to follow my lead. Take the mask off.

09:57.875 --> 10:00.542
-Okay. Yeah. -I'll do the talking.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.500
-George, call me George.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.709
So, they don't know who I am, I'll be George with Gerry.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.667
Gerry and George. Oh, Seinfeld.

10:12.709 --> 10:15.250
Ha! You were like...

10:15.291 --> 10:18.291
"We're not robbing the bus!" I'm like, "Gerry!"

10:18.333 --> 10:21.709
We'll work it out...Let's go!

10:21.750 --> 10:24.542
: Hello... -Patty!

10:24.583 --> 10:27.291
-Patty! -This is Gerry, I'm George.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.709
-Ah, Patty's a beautiful name.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.917
We are your bus monitors today, they assigned us.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.500
-Ahhh...

10:37.542 --> 10:39.458
They didn't tell you? Today. Today.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.000
Today, you should have got a memo in the bus mailbox.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.375
-Sounds great to me. Hop on board!

10:43.041 --> 10:45.375
: Alright.

10:45.417 --> 10:48.041
: She's onto us. : Shut up George.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.166
-Finally, there you are. We can get started.

10:50.208 --> 10:53.834
: What are you doing? -The pregnant people are in this

10:50.208 --> 10:53.834
group behind me, okay?

10:53.875 --> 10:56.125
These are the loosiest of the goosies.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.959
-Ahhh, yes I am.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.542
If somebody's pregnant, they're in this group. Follow my lead.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.834
: No.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.792
-So, morning ladies.

11:05.834 --> 11:10.166
Before we get started does anyone have anything they'd

11:05.834 --> 11:10.166
like to confess?

11:10.208 --> 11:13.625
Feeling sick this morning Cold feet?

11:13.667 --> 11:16.709
Craving pickles or ice cream? Show of hands if you're gaseous.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.875
: Okay, that's enough Robert.

11:18.917 --> 11:21.458
-This is not going nearly as well as I'd hoped.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.917
: You don't say. -Beep.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.625
Hey! Any of you gals pregnant?

11:26.667 --> 11:29.583
-Okay.

11:29.625 --> 11:33.333
Me thinks the lady doth protest a little too much.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.208
-You can tell me, I'm

11:33.375 --> 11:36.208
here to help.

11:36.250 --> 11:40.250
-If you tell us what's going on.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.583
If you're brave enough to share your news,

11:42.625 --> 11:45.375
Then you'll pave the way for others to be as brave as you

11:42.625 --> 11:45.375
are.

11:45.417 --> 11:48.458
It gets better. : Look, sir...

11:45.417 --> 11:48.458
: I'm a virgin.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.166
-I'm a virgin.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.542
-Okay, thank you.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.542
Thank you, Robert.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.875
That's enough,

11:53.583 --> 11:56.875
ladies, go back to class.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.875
: Yeah.

12:00.917 --> 12:04.000
: I just thought Francine was like a layup.

12:00.917 --> 12:04.000
: Stop talking!

12:04.041 --> 12:06.166
-Open like a 7-Eleven. Well... -Enough!

12:06.208 --> 12:08.625
-Not like you to misread a woman, Robert.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.625
-Exactly.

12:08.667 --> 12:12.250
-Okay, this is a sensitive time in these girls developments,

12:08.667 --> 12:12.250
okay?

12:12.291 --> 12:15.208
We have to be delicate with how we broach the subject.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.959
We can't just judge a book by it's cover, Robert!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.333
-You're absolutely right. -Thank you.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.500
-We've been going about this the wrong way.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.500
-Well...

12:22.542 --> 12:24.417
We've been superficial. We have to treat the whole

12:24.458 --> 12:27.291
student population like they're floozies, no matter what they

12:24.458 --> 12:27.291
look like.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.583
-Nope. No. No. -That is good work. Let's roll.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.375
-That's not...That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant.

12:32.417 --> 12:35.792
-Yeah, I know. But good luck gettin' that train back to the

12:32.417 --> 12:35.792
station.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.333
: And speeding. : Here they come,

12:35.834 --> 12:38.333
okay.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.125
-Look at this guy, look at

12:38.375 --> 12:41.125
this guy, look at this guy.

12:41.166 --> 12:45.208
Easy, easy prey. Nice sweater, Sally. Your

12:41.166 --> 12:45.208
grandma make that for you?

12:45.250 --> 12:47.917
: What's going on?

12:47.959 --> 12:50.750
-I think this guy's trying to say something mean about my

12:47.959 --> 12:50.750
sweater.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.750
-So, why don't you give it back. Go ahead.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.625
The one your Nana made you before she died.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.625
: Mmm hmm.

12:55.667 --> 12:58.291
-I didn't know she died. -Are you making fun of

12:55.667 --> 12:58.291
Nana's sweater?

12:58.333 --> 13:00.375
How about we focus on me.

13:00.417 --> 13:03.083
Look at this stupid vest I have to wear, hold on.

13:00.417 --> 13:03.083
Hold on.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.125
: Dude says he's glad Nana's dead.

13:05.166 --> 13:08.041
-I never said that. That's a lie. I never said that.

13:05.166 --> 13:08.041
-That's a low blow, Gerry.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.291
: That's too much. -Let's get him guys!

13:08.083 --> 13:10.291
For my Nana!

13:10.333 --> 13:13.041
: Fight, fight. : Want me to keep

13:10.333 --> 13:13.041

13:13.083 --> 13:15.333
: Keep rolling!

13:15.375 --> 13:18.291
: Ouch! Maybe I'm good. I think we got it. For real!

13:18.333 --> 13:20.333
: Fight, fight, fight, fight.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.041
-Whoo! I'm in love!

13:25.917 --> 13:28.375
Um I'm gonna ask you a question.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.166
-That's the woman who murdered my wife.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.166
-That's Donna. -That's right. Love her.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.375
Hate her! But love her!

13:44.417 --> 13:47.458
Can you hold that up a little higher for me. There ya are.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.625
Just hold it nice and close to Donna.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.709
Whaddya see?

13:52.750 --> 13:55.583
I want you to look at the murderer, then I want you

13:52.750 --> 13:55.583
to look at your girlfriend.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.333
Murderer, girlfriend. Murderer, girlfriend.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.750
Follow me. Da, da, da, da.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.458
Okay, do you see any similarities?

14:03.500 --> 14:07.458
-Yeah, I see a similarity. -Yeah, they look exactly

14:03.500 --> 14:07.458
the same. Mmm hmm.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.709
Mmm hmm.

14:14.291 --> 14:17.125
-Cool, I'll say it. It's like they're the same person, Paul!

14:17.166 --> 14:20.500
Yeah, it's like maybe you're dating your wife's

14:17.166 --> 14:20.500
murderer.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.333
: He thinks so too.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.000
: Oh, that's a good one. : Ahh.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.291
-I'm gonna call her, she'll appreciate this.

14:31.333 --> 14:34.083
: Here we go. : Hey babe.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.250
I got a good one for you.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.959
Yeah, my coworkers think, ah, you murdered my wife.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.250
-Yeah.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.250
: Oh snap. -She's a killer.

14:47.291 --> 14:50.667
: I'm sorry.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.083
: Life. You know what?

14:55.125 --> 14:57.417
At least she's an honest person.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.250
-He took the scenic route, but he got there eventually.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.250
-Sure.

15:04.291 --> 15:06.583
-Those kids really beat the crap outta you.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.750
-I let them.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.291
'Cause physical abuse is worth more than verbal.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.208
I'm gonna make a fortune here.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.166
-We're gonna raise so much awareness for school bus monitor

15:13.250 --> 15:16.166
bullying.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.166
-Yeah, that too.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.667
-But this beating just goes on and on.

15:20.709 --> 15:23.750
It kind of escalates too. It gets even more ferocious.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.333
You'd think they'd tire themselves out but they

15:23.792 --> 15:26.333
just kept going.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.291
-Well, it was quite a performance I put on.

15:31.834 --> 15:34.417
Hey get that online as quickly as possible. Okay?

15:34.458 --> 15:38.291
-Eat your heart out

15:34.458 --> 15:38.291
Chiwetel Ejiofor

15:39.625 --> 15:42.333
: Well, it's

15:39.625 --> 15:42.333
happened again.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.834
Another case of student bus violence,

15:44.875 --> 15:48.041
as third grade students viciously attack a bus monitor.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.917
-Wow, word travels fast. -It sure does.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.583
-The whole thing was caught on tape. A warning to our viewers.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.750
The footage can be difficult to watch.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.291
: And is quite

15:54.792 --> 15:57.291
pathetic.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.083
: Never make fun of my Nana again!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.041
-Oh my God, this worked.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.458
-Wow, they are really going to town on you.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.458
: A grown man

16:04.500 --> 16:07.792
unable to fight off a frenzy of tiny furious fists.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.792
-It's all part of the show Bill.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.208
-Public reaction has been similar to previous incidents.

16:10.250 --> 16:14.291
With a Kickstarter campaign having already raised over

16:10.250 --> 16:14.291
sixty thousand dollars,

16:14.333 --> 16:17.333
As a show of support. -Oh my gosh!

16:17.375 --> 16:19.166
Sixty thousand already.

16:19.208 --> 16:22.834
-This time, however, the funds are being raised to help the

16:19.208 --> 16:22.834
children.

16:22.875 --> 16:26.250
-Calling them "victims of

16:22.875 --> 16:26.250
circumstance"

16:26.291 --> 16:28.291
The kids: The public

16:26.291 --> 16:28.291
wants to know:

16:28.333 --> 16:31.834
What are the systemic failures leading such young children

16:28.333 --> 16:31.834
to turn to violence?

16:31.875 --> 16:34.291
: The kids are the victims?

16:34.333 --> 16:36.250
What the hell is that? Right there!

16:36.291 --> 16:39.125
-Shut up Bill!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.291
-If only you brought some of that anger to the fight.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.709
You coulda taken one of these kids out.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.625
♪ Music

16:45.667 --> 16:48.834
-Hey Paul, I'm really sorry about Donna.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.542
What are the odds, right? -One in a million.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.542
-Exactly!

16:56.458 --> 16:58.667
: Mr. Dwyer, you have a collect call from

16:58.709 --> 17:01.166
Northgate Detention Centre on line three.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.709
Yeah, I miss you too.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.917
! You just turned her in!

17:09.959 --> 17:12.542
: One sec. Listen, every relationship

17:09.959 --> 17:12.542
got ups and downs, okay?

17:12.583 --> 17:14.917
Just like any other couple.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.875
No, no. Call me back.

17:18.917 --> 17:23.250
: She said the food sucks in there. Poor thing.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.208
-Poor thing.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.500
-Ladies, we wanted to rap...

17:28.542 --> 17:31.875
-Well... -With you about...

17:31.917 --> 17:34.083
A big teenage...

17:34.125 --> 17:37.542
Preganante elephant in the room. -Yes.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.417
Thank you, Mr. Cheeley. Um...

17:41.083 --> 17:45.125
You know, an unplanned pregnancy can happen to just about

17:41.083 --> 17:45.125
anybody.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.542
I...

17:47.583 --> 17:50.041
Excuse me, sorry. No, I'm okay. : Oh dear.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.166
: I'm so sorry. -Come in.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.500
You know, we've all made mistakes, right?

17:54.542 --> 17:58.000
And some of them are huge devastating mistakes.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.291
-Easy. I mean

18:00.333 --> 18:03.750
If you should find yourself...

18:03.792 --> 18:05.917
It's not the end of the world.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.291
Because we are here as your...

18:09.333 --> 18:11.333
: Yeah.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.375
He's basically saying, it's a shared responsibility,

18:11.375 --> 18:14.375
alright ladies?

18:14.417 --> 18:17.000
A team effort. Support from both people.

18:17.041 --> 18:20.208
-You know, the good news is because your young once you

18:17.041 --> 18:20.208
do pa-ting!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.208
-Okay. -Then everything'll just...

18:22.250 --> 18:26.208
Back up to it's firm, high place because your body's essentially

18:22.250 --> 18:26.208
are...

18:26.250 --> 18:28.333
-Okay, that's fine. Thank you Robert.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.333
-Elasticized.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.875
: Oh, excuse me. Oh.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.792
-Okay...

18:35.834 --> 18:38.000
: Come on, Bobbi. You're a disaster.

18:38.041 --> 18:40.125
-Trent, it sounds like we might have a hot mic.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.125
Can you kill the mic please: Twelve sticks.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.417
-Ah, this took a bit of a strange turn. So let's...

18:42.166 --> 18:45.417
Maybe we should call it.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.083
My door's always open. Call me, text.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.583
: Why'd I have tequila with Robert?

18:50.625 --> 18:53.041
: I can't believe that idiot's the father.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.333
: I'm gonna have a little Cheeley baby.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.417
-I come across, on the internet, this video...

19:03.458 --> 19:06.500
Of a bus monitor getting beaten up.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.458
Like, destroyed.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.125
-It's that one where a bunch of children...

19:12.166 --> 19:16.792
Jump a forty something year old person about your build.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.250
-Poor, poor guy. -Cut the crap Gerry.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.125
I know it was you.  Me?

19:22.166 --> 19:25.125
Why would you think that was me

19:25.166 --> 19:27.625
Why are you on another school's bus?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.959
-Okay, fine. Sue me.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.041
But I wanted to experience what it was like to be a bus monitor.

19:35.083 --> 19:39.125
'Cause that's every teachers dream. To be a bus monitor.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.083
Sorry, backfired a little bit.

19:41.125 --> 19:44.000
-Well, I am so sorry. I had no idea that...

19:44.041 --> 19:48.208
It was your lifetime goal to be a bus monitor.

19:44.041 --> 19:48.208
-Okay.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.458
-I will do the best that I can to correct this oversight that

19:48.250 --> 19:51.458
I've made.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.875
: No, don't worry about it. No, forget it, done.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.875
-'Cause it's clearly a dream.

19:54.917 --> 19:57.041
-No, it's too late, because as much as those kids...

19:57.083 --> 19:59.709
Smashed my face in, over and over again...

19:59.750 --> 20:02.417
You have smashed my feelings.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.667
Dammit.

20:04.709 --> 20:07.625
-Be careful what you wish for.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.959
-Okay, let's get goin' here.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.959
Oh gosh.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.041
: Oh boy.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.000
: Pft.

20:16.709 --> 20:19.625
: Move your foot. -Seat's taken, so get outta

20:16.709 --> 20:19.625
here.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.875
You think I want to sit here? It's the last seat on the bus.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.542
I don't like it any more than you do.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.834
-Fine, but no talking.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.291
-You might want to put some steak on that.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.000
