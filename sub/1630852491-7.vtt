00:01.035 --> 00:03.071
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.104 --> 00:04.805
Hey, I picked up the turkey
for our three-day brine.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.140
I-I love a good brine.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.508
You know,
you're welcome to join us.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.911
-(Jack crying)
-Kate, you just need to relax.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.413
-Okay?
-Really? What you needed to do

00:12.446 --> 00:15.149
was put him to bed at 3:00
like I asked you to.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.151
Build me that house.

00:17.185 --> 00:20.020
The house
he was gonna build for me.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.356
*

00:23.624 --> 00:25.726
(Tchaikovsky's
Piano Concerto No. 1 playing)

00:40.774 --> 00:43.611
(birds chirping)

00:43.644 --> 00:46.280
(soft chatter)

00:46.314 --> 00:48.982
*

00:54.455 --> 00:56.857
A-Aren't you having a piece?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.459
No.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.494
We have to watch ourselves,
Rebecca.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.064
*

01:05.133 --> 01:08.136
Hey, do you think your dad's
actually gonna let me carve?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.903
Yeah. Of course.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.772
-This is our Thanksgiving.
-Mm.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.942
I mean, the sugar pie might
not turn out exactly right,

01:14.975 --> 01:16.777
but that's only because my mom

01:16.810 --> 01:19.313
refuses to reveal
the secret ingredient.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.948
-Mm.
-But it doesn't matter.

01:20.981 --> 01:24.118
Today, Rebecca Malone
is in charge.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.954
-Yes, she is.
And soon to be Rebecca Pearson.
-Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.956
-Mm-hmm.
-(chuckling)

01:28.989 --> 01:30.958
Mmm.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.161
-Mmm. Hey. Do you know
what time it is?
-Mmm. Yeah.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.328
Because I want to be sure
to clean up

01:34.362 --> 01:35.329
-before they...
-(doorbell rings)

01:35.363 --> 01:37.097
-(groans)
-...get here.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.633
-Yep.
-Uh, okay,
let me put this in the oven.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.369
JACK:
Okay.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.640
(stops mixer)

01:48.976 --> 01:50.544
'Kay.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.183
So, Mom, you nervous
about your boyfriend

01:55.216 --> 01:56.484
coming to Thanksgiving dinner?

01:56.517 --> 01:57.851
I'm okay.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.120
I just hope the boys
don't feel threatened

02:00.154 --> 02:01.255
-by Matt.
-Mm.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.123
REBECCA:
I am excited

02:03.157 --> 02:05.159
to meet Miguel's girlfriend.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.161
She's French.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.196
Marguerite.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.930
-Oh.
-Yeah.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.500
Remember making this pie
when you were a little girl?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.335
You loved being my sous chef.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.336
(chuckles softly)

02:15.369 --> 02:16.337
Here.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.571
Taste.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.341
Mm.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.347
You want to try and guess
the secret ingredient

02:26.380 --> 02:28.349
like you used to?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.851
Oh, I think it's the massive
amounts of butter and sugar

02:30.884 --> 02:32.886
that make it taste so good.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.156
* And Anna begin *

02:36.190 --> 02:37.391
Mm. Eh.

02:37.425 --> 02:38.992
* And Anna begin *

02:39.026 --> 02:40.828
No. No, no, no.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.398
* And Anna begins... *

02:44.432 --> 02:47.235
-KATE: Okay...
-(strumming)

02:47.268 --> 02:49.069
What are you doing?

02:49.102 --> 02:51.705
I am writing down the sugar pie
recipe, in case I forget.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.308
Oh. You mean in case I forget.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.010
Well, you don't need to worry,
because these recipes

02:57.044 --> 02:59.313
live deep inside.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.249
Besides,
I don't know if I'm ready

03:01.282 --> 03:03.150
to reveal the secret ingredient
quite yet.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.252
-(chuckles)
-Here.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.719
Let my grandson lick that.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.588
-Ooh!
-Mm-hmm.

03:07.621 --> 03:11.091
Jack, do you want to try
Grandma's pie?

03:11.124 --> 03:13.193
You want to try?
You want to taste it?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.264
-(gasps) What do you think?
-Good.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.266
-Is it good?
Would you like some more?
-Yeah.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.501
Okay, let's-let's not go
sugar crazy.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.735
He's already got sugary cereal,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.337
-so...
-Um, actually,

03:23.371 --> 03:24.972
his cereal's whole grain.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.008
Are you sure?
'Cause it tastes frosted.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.510
Yeah, no, I'm positive. Yeah.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.345
You would know if you went
on our grocery runs with us.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.881
Hey, I said I was willing to go
on the weekends,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.383
but you said
you wanted to go with your mom.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.618
-So...
-You know what?
It's Thanksgiving.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.720
Can we just let our son
enjoy it?

03:41.455 --> 03:42.790
Fine.
(clears throat)

03:42.823 --> 03:44.558
Yeah.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.563
* My twins are in Reseda *

03:50.464 --> 03:52.433
* On this Turkey Day *

03:52.466 --> 03:54.402
* I wish I was with them *

03:54.435 --> 03:57.271
* But Elijah got his way *

03:57.305 --> 03:59.873
* Even Uncle Nicky's
got a girlfriend *

03:59.907 --> 04:03.411
* He's in Topeka with her now *

04:03.444 --> 04:05.946
I guess I'll just be alone.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.982
Till my tin heart goes...

04:09.016 --> 04:09.983
(strums loudly)

04:10.017 --> 04:11.985
(whispers):
...ka-plow.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.154
I just made that up on the fly.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.791
Um, has anyone heard
from Randall?

04:17.825 --> 04:20.961
* Call me Al *

04:20.994 --> 04:22.830
* Call me Al. *

04:22.863 --> 04:24.064
(phone rings)

04:24.097 --> 04:25.999
(muttering): Come on, man.
What's going on?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.502
Hey, I'm trying
to get my gobble on, Jae-won.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.103
This better be of the utmost.

04:30.137 --> 04:33.006
Sorry, I know. But I figured
this was worth the interruption.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.943
Senator Gamble's office
keeps calling.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.512
He saw the article
in The Philadelphia Local

04:38.546 --> 04:40.113
and sends his regards.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.382
Huh.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.785
Tell the senator
I have to call the old fart back

04:44.818 --> 04:46.186
after the holiday.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.621
Today's a family day.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.357
I'll polish up the language
and pass it on.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.991
You the man. Gobble, gobble.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.526
-Gobble, gobble.
-We're so cute.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.161
I know. All right, later.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.829
-Later.
-(phone beeps off)

04:55.863 --> 04:57.931
My man.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.368
-Brushing off the senator.
-Pshh.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.636
No more work calls, no emails.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.271
The only thing
I'm using this phone for

05:04.304 --> 05:08.376
is to record every memory
of this epic Pearson holiday.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.345
I want the girls to spend
some quality time with my mom.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.481
Hey, ladies.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.116
Girls.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.317
Girls...!

05:17.351 --> 05:18.952
-Yeah.
-What? What?
-Are we there?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.187
RANDALL:
Ladies,

05:20.220 --> 05:23.023
I would like to make a request,
all right?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.526
That you put your phones away
for today.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.861
No Instagram, no TikTok.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.531
Deja, do you think
you can refrain

05:30.564 --> 05:32.633
for one day
from texting with Malik?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.636
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.638
He's acting so weird.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.940
He hasn't texted all morning.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.843
RANDALL:
Huh.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.044
Okay.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.379
All right, you guys
can go back to...

05:45.413 --> 05:47.915
Yeah, exactly what you're doing
right now.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.650
Great.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.051
Anyway,

05:51.084 --> 05:53.521
it's gonna be a rewarding
and drama-free Thanksgiving.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.523
Aw, baby.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.857
-I love your heart.
-Mm.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.426
-Dig your ambition.
-Thank you.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.494
But the Pearson epitaph
will read,

06:00.528 --> 06:01.829
"Lovely people,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.497
"cried a lot,

06:03.531 --> 06:05.399
traumatic-as-hell
Thanksgivings."

06:06.900 --> 06:08.268
YOUNG RANDALL:
We're here.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.238
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.775
Sophie and I broke up.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.610
Beer?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.012
Uh, nah, man, it's-it's
only noon, so I'm good.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.649
Yeah, he cheated on her,
like a freakin' idiot.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.620
What? Want to say something?

06:26.654 --> 06:29.890
Oh, no, n-- uh, nothing,
it's just good to see my sis.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.892
-Ah.
-Hey.
-(gasps)

06:31.925 --> 06:33.861
All of my babies are here.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.228
-Hey, Mom, how you doing?
-Oh...

06:35.262 --> 06:37.030
-Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.766
Happy Thanksgiving, sweetheart.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.768
(laughs):
Hi.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.604
Oh, you guys, thank you so much
for being supportive today.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.440
I know it might feel
a little weird, but...

06:46.474 --> 06:49.810
Matt's a, he's a really
great guy, I promise.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.445
Well, that was nice to hear.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.814
-(laughs): Oh. Hi.
-Sorry, the door was open.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.549
It's okay, come on in.
Good to see you.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.785
-Happy Thanksgiving. Hi.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.720
Um, these are my kids.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.722
-Well, uh, you know
Kevin and Kate.
-Yeah, good to see you.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.558
And then this is my son Randall
and his girlfriend Beth.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.293
-MATT: Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.628
-Matt.
-(chuckles)

07:10.030 --> 07:12.733
Firm handshake.
You own your own house?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.635
-MATT: I mean,
it's a town house.
-Oh, man,

07:14.668 --> 07:16.269
this is gonna be a good one.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.905
TOBY:
Hey!

07:17.938 --> 07:20.407
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-RANDALL: Hello, family.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.310
The Black Pearsons have arrived
for Thanksgiving.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.278
(imitates airhorn blowing)

07:25.312 --> 07:26.947
-KATE: So good to see you.
-(knocking on door)

07:29.683 --> 07:31.585
-REBECCA: Hi. Oh...
-Ah.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.754
-Mwah. Hi, I'm Marguerite.
-(chuckles)

07:33.787 --> 07:35.656
I've been waiting
an eternity to meet you.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.958
-You are stunning.
-Oh.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.527
Miguel talks about you
all the time.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.428
REBECCA (laughs):
Oh, come on in. Hi, thank you.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.197
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.834
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.169
-REBECCA: Come in, come in.
-Right on.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.805
-Oh, you remember Matt, right?
-Oh, yeah.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.473
-Yeah. Hey. Hey, Miguel. Yeah.
-Hey. Good to see you.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.676
Hmm.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.545
-REBECCA: Um...
-That was awkward, right?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.980
-Yeah, there's a lot
going on here.
-Mm-hmm.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.149
-ADULT RANDALL: Hey, Kate.
-ADULT KATE: Yeah.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.119
Tell the story of Mom making us
those homemade turkey costumes.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.621
Oh, my gosh, okay,
they were so cute,

08:07.655 --> 08:09.456
but there were so many ruffles.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.191
Like, you couldn't even
move your arms.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.393
-(laughter)
-Hey, guys?

08:13.426 --> 08:16.697
Um, so after dinner, I'd love
to have a little family talk.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.199
Just the four of us and Miguel.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.201
It's so rare that we're all
together like this.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.203
It's nothing bad, I just...

08:23.236 --> 08:26.674
I want to go over
a few things, okay?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.310
-Okay.
-Yeah, of course, Mom.
-Of course. Yeah, yeah.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.647
-You got it.
-Cool. Yep.

08:33.681 --> 08:37.517
Yep. It's gonna be a hell
of a Thanksgiving.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.587
*

08:47.795 --> 08:49.730
Okay.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.665
JANET:
Ooh.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.766
(inhales)

08:52.800 --> 08:54.602
Did you add
the secret ingredient?

08:54.635 --> 08:57.838
I did not, 'cause you didn't
tell me what it is.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.007
-I didn't?
-No.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.176
-You did not, and you know that.
-Ah. Well...

09:03.210 --> 09:05.445
So, have you found
your wedding dress?

09:05.478 --> 09:08.181
'Cause I can dig through
my closet for mine.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.952
I'm okay. I think
I'm gonna go with something

09:11.985 --> 09:13.787
flowy, less traditional.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.122
JANET:
Well, you know, the months

09:15.155 --> 09:17.858
leading up to the wedding
are so stressful.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.860
-Uh-huh...
-My advice:

09:19.893 --> 09:21.895
starve yourself early on,

09:21.929 --> 09:24.765
and it'll give you a buffer
for bad decisions later.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.300
REBECCA:
You know what, Mom?
I think I look just fine.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.869
You think they're gonna
kill each other?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.138
DAVE:
Oh, it's quite, quite possible.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.106
JANET:
So, how is the gravy coming?

09:33.140 --> 09:36.309
Ooh, you didn't strain it.
Look, see all the lumps?

09:36.343 --> 09:37.878
Yeah, okay, Mom,
I'm just getting started...

09:37.911 --> 09:39.346
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.
-...so give me a chance.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.083
MARGUERITE:
Sorry I'm-I'm not more help.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.218
I'm a horrible cook.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.587
When I'm in the kitchen,
it's like,

09:47.621 --> 09:50.423
-"Houston, we have a problem."
-(both laugh)

09:54.127 --> 09:57.130
Um, where-where
is the-the toilet?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.132
Oh, this way. I'll show you.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.106
-You need some help with that?
-Yeah.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.941
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-All right.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.110
Yeah, it's, uh, it's Pinot noir.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.645
It's, uh, Rebecca's favorite.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.147
-Oh, yeah? Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.651
-Uh, let's see. There we go.
-All right.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.321
Is it okay?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.623
Sure.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.792
(sighs)

10:24.825 --> 10:27.695
I-I just want this to go well.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.163
I want the kids
to like me, you know?

10:30.197 --> 10:33.834
I'm hoping to stick around for
as long as Rebecca will have me.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.672
-Yeah? Yeah. Oh.
-Yeah.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.808
COMMENTATOR:
Dan Marino thinks
it's a blitz...

10:40.841 --> 10:42.876
(TV continues indistinctly)

10:47.981 --> 10:50.450
Why do you keep
looking at Kate, man?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.619
She's just gained
a lot of weight.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.855
KEVIN:
Of course she has.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.857
Think about her life, man.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.358
She lives with Mom,

10:58.391 --> 10:59.960
she's got the worst ex-boyfriend
of all time,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.730
she thinks her dog
killed our dad.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.131
(exhales)

11:04.164 --> 11:06.133
I can totally tell when
they're talking about me.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.301
Randall was shocked
when he saw how big I've gotten.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.571
Hey, everybody gains
the freshman 15 at college.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.141
Yeah, well,
I gained the freshman 40

11:14.174 --> 11:15.408
and I'm not even in college.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.650
ADULT KEVIN:
All right, everybody.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.986
So, this is it, this is the land

11:26.019 --> 11:29.689
that will eventually become
the Pearson family mecca.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.091
Soak it in, people.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.826
RANDALL:
Hey.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.928
So, this talk.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.363
You think Mom's gonna
tell us she needs

11:36.396 --> 11:38.198
to have her driver's license
taken away?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.567
Or what if she lost all
her money to online scammers?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.536
Or maybe she and Miguel
want to become a throuple.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.238
-RANDALL: Oh, Lord. Man-- Kate?
-What?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.607
-It could be anything.
-Kate, what do you think?

11:47.640 --> 11:50.610
I just think that we should
trust Mom, you know?

11:50.643 --> 11:52.880
Let her share
what she wants to share.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.116
-Yeah.
-TOBY: Hey, Kate?
I'm-I'm at my wit's end.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.617
I had to strap him
into the stroller,

11:57.650 --> 11:59.619
'cause he-he w-- he just--
he won't walk with his cane,

11:59.652 --> 12:00.788
and when I pick him up,
he goes nuclear.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.622
Have you tried narrating to him?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.391
Like, the colors of the birds
or the trees?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.793
He just gets really frustrated

12:05.826 --> 12:07.294
when he doesn't know
the full picture.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.930
Yeah, I-I know what he likes,
it's just hard to narrate

12:09.963 --> 12:12.232
a David Attenborough documentary
when he's losing his mind

12:12.265 --> 12:15.268
because he's had too much sugar.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.970
Seriously?

12:17.004 --> 12:18.438
TOBY:
Yeah, seriously.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.940
You know, guys, when I-- um,

12:19.973 --> 12:21.441
if Jack's upset
at home sometimes,

12:21.474 --> 12:23.610
I'll just, I'll sing to him.
(chuckles)

12:23.643 --> 12:25.445
Oh, Jack likes music?

12:25.478 --> 12:26.914
-KATE: Toby.
-Wow. Thanks, Kev.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.281
Hey, can you just,
can you help me

12:28.315 --> 12:30.818
-instead of instructing me?
-Yeah, Tobe, I can.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.789
They're like that
all the time lately.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.424
Yeah, baby stage is rough.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.627
Beth and I used to have
these intense wordless fights.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.495
You ever had a woman
scream at you with her eyes?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.798
-(chuckles)
-Oh, stop the presses,

12:44.832 --> 12:46.299
ladies and gentlemen.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.669
The Pearson girls are teaching
Grandma how to floss.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.471
Aww, snap.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.340
Get it, Rebecca.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.309
All right, everybody, come on.
Gather around, let's go.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.578
Come on. I want to show you
what's up.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.781
So, uh, all right, I know
it's just flags for now, right?

13:01.815 --> 13:05.618
But, um, I'm following
Dad's sketch to a T.

13:05.652 --> 13:08.288
And, uh, okay, so we got Randall
right behind you.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.623
That right there, that is your
family wing, that whole thing.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.360
-RANDALL: whoa, whoa, whoa!
-KEVIN: You know? And then, uh,

13:13.393 --> 13:15.628
Kate, your family wing
is gonna be right there.

13:15.662 --> 13:19.833
That whole thing right there,
and then, uh, uh, well...

13:19.867 --> 13:22.970
-Mom.
-Mm-hmm?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.973
The primary suite, for you.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.341
Right-right in the center.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.477
-REBECCA: Wow.
-Yeah. Yeah--
And I haven't decided

13:30.510 --> 13:31.979
what we're gonna do
with this area quite yet.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.713
But, you know, I was tinkering
around a couple of ideas.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.448
Bocce ball court,
I thought, maybe?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.684
-That'd be fun.
-Hey. Guys.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.453
Pearsons, Damons, Rivases,
let's do a family photo.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.322
-All right.
-Oh.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.894
You all right?

13:46.927 --> 13:48.561
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
taking everything...

13:48.595 --> 13:50.397
-taking everything in.
-All right.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.866
Let me ask you
a question, Kevin. Um...

13:52.900 --> 13:54.634
Do you have any plans
for a guesthouse,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.669
maybe for people
outside of the family?

13:57.704 --> 13:58.972
Oh, uh...

13:59.006 --> 14:00.673
(laughs):
Well, you know, it's a, it's a,

14:00.707 --> 14:02.242
it's a family compound, Miguel,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.411
so it really wasn't on the top
of my priority list.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.746
-(chuckles)
-And I know that you're
Mr. Construction Guy,

14:06.779 --> 14:08.015
-and all that-- No, I mean,
I get it, I get it.
-I'm just...

14:08.048 --> 14:10.517
-But-but I-I...
-Amigos, por favor.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.552
Family photo time.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.087
Yeah. All right.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.855
Come on.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.429
COMMENTATOR:
Huddle for the Miami Dolphins.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.765
REBECCA:
Mom. The plates are fine. Stop.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.267
-(glass shatters)
-(gasps)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.435
REBECCA:
Great.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.737
-You think I should go in there?
-No.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.039
No, no, no.
I think you should stay

14:32.072 --> 14:35.108
right here with me
and Tom Collins.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.877
(laughs)
You see, Jack,

14:37.911 --> 14:40.747
the relationship between
mothers and daughters

14:40.780 --> 14:44.451
is very complicated,
and it is a dynamic

14:44.484 --> 14:46.453
that us men
will never understand.

14:46.486 --> 14:50.257
They live
in a perpetual hellscape...

14:50.290 --> 14:52.792
-BOTH: Dinner is ready.
-JACK: Ooh.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.627
-Wow. That looks wonderful.
-Ah.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.629
Okay, time to carve.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.100
Oh, no. Jack is gonna
carve, right?

15:00.133 --> 15:02.135
-JACK: Yeah.
-Yep.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.636
Carve that turkey, son.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.405
It's the only way
we all get out of here alive.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.374
(laughs)

15:07.407 --> 15:08.976
Ah...

15:14.014 --> 15:15.282
-Hey.
-REBECCA: Hi.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.285
I know this is anti-feminist,

15:18.318 --> 15:20.287
but can you please
carve the turkey?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.290
-(chuckles) Of course. Yeah.
-Thank you.

15:23.323 --> 15:27.227
Oh, have you had a chance
to chat with Matt yet?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.628
Uh, yes.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.131
He is very nice.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.967
Uh, he is no sommelier,
but he is nice.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.969
Oh, like that matters to me.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.837
(both laugh)

15:37.870 --> 15:39.639
He is really great, though, huh?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.609
-He's so sweet.
-Yeah, he is the sweetest.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.943
I mean, he's not the sweetest,

15:43.977 --> 15:46.313
he is the perfect amount
of sweet.

15:46.346 --> 15:50.783
Not too sweet, not too sour,
just right down the middle.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.187
(laughs softly)
Yeah.

15:54.221 --> 15:58.125
Oh, um, and Marguerite
is really beautiful.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.692
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.461
I have to admit, though,
I-I thought,

16:01.494 --> 16:05.598
with her accent, she might be
a little more... worldly?

16:05.632 --> 16:09.602
But she's-she's actually
remarkably normal.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.105
-Uh-- Is she?
-Mm-hmm.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.806
Yeah, very normal.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.977
* Anna begin... *

16:18.011 --> 16:19.379
Nope.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.648
* Be... * Ugh... Begin... *

16:21.681 --> 16:24.151
There she is,
the Thanksgiving Queen.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.785
KEVIN:
Good, right?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.121
What should I do first,
should I use the knife

16:28.155 --> 16:32.325
to stab Randall's iPhone
or slice Kevin's guitar strings?

16:32.359 --> 16:33.726
Hey, Kevin, you want to take
a break from that guitar

16:33.760 --> 16:35.795
-for a little while?
-Oh, so sorry,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.164
is it bothering you
that I'm playing? The--

16:37.197 --> 16:39.499
Is it a bigger faux pas
than me not building a...

16:39.532 --> 16:41.201
extra wing
on our family compound

16:41.234 --> 16:43.136
for your fishing buddies?

16:43.170 --> 16:46.005
*

16:46.039 --> 16:47.907
MIGUEL:
I'm telling you, Matt,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.576
Y2K is real.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.812
I mean, I-I'm gonna put
all of my money in a mattress

16:52.845 --> 16:54.714
because I am freaked out
about Y2K.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.483
(laughter)

16:56.516 --> 16:57.650
Here you go.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.052
Whoa-- Oh.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.320
-Uh...
-Uh-oh.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.155
Houston, we have a problem.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.023
(both laugh)

17:04.057 --> 17:06.193
She likes that line, huh?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.927
Big Apollo 13 fan?

17:07.960 --> 17:11.164
Oh, no, we just have this
inside joke going on right now.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.200
-Yeah.
-Oh.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.601
Hmm.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.003
Mmm.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.839
You know, if you two want
to get married at the club,

17:19.872 --> 17:22.942
we've got to put
your names in soon.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.945
Can we hold off on the wedding
talk for now, please?

17:25.978 --> 17:28.181
-Thank you.
-Ah.

17:28.215 --> 17:32.785
* I don't find this stuff
amusing anymore *

17:32.819 --> 17:34.954
* If you'll be my bodyguard *

17:34.987 --> 17:37.990
* I can be your
long-lost pal... *

17:38.991 --> 17:40.127
RANDALL:
Hey, Kate.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.928
Uh, I know it probably
gets quiet here

17:41.961 --> 17:43.363
with just you and Mom.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.632
You should come visit Beth and I
at Carnegie Mellon more.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.735
Maybe audit a class.
Check out a party?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.247
REBECCA:
So good.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.581
* A man walks
down the street... *

18:01.614 --> 18:03.082
Uh, easy, easy.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.986
You know what, Mom?

18:07.019 --> 18:09.088
I'm actually gonna eat
the food that I cooked

18:09.122 --> 18:12.492
because I am hungry and Jack
loves me just the way I am.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.428
Mmm.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.896
Mmm...

18:16.929 --> 18:19.499
* Now that my role model
is gone, gone... *

18:21.801 --> 18:23.903
* So if you'll be my bodyguard *

18:23.936 --> 18:28.007
* I can be
your long-lost pal... *

18:30.042 --> 18:33.246
And we're not gonna get married
at your stuffy country club,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.114
and none of your friends
are invited because the day

18:35.148 --> 18:36.583
is about us, right?

18:36.616 --> 18:39.186
Not about the silly women
that you play bridge with

18:39.219 --> 18:40.687
that you secretly hate.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.624
Oh, the pie.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.626
The famous sugar pie. Mom.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.428
What is the secret ingredient,
huh?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.198
What is it? Is it, um--
hmm, let me see.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.300
Is it... is it baloney?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.169
Because you haven't had
a slice of this in 20 years.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.937
JACK:
Rebecca...

18:57.970 --> 18:59.972
* A man walks down
the street... *

19:00.006 --> 19:01.641
* It's a street... *

19:01.674 --> 19:03.310
It's everything I say.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.677
-Honey...
-Everything.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.846
Yeah...
(stammers)

19:06.879 --> 19:08.848
* Doesn't speak
the language... *

19:08.881 --> 19:10.983
(laughs softly)

19:11.017 --> 19:13.386
-Fill her up.
-There you-- Boom.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.556
-All right, so,
you excited for Thanksgiving?
-Yeah.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.492
Yeah, you want to feel this?
T-This is the Pilgrim Rick hat.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.129
It celebrates the creepy
roadside motel clerk

19:23.162 --> 19:24.364
of Pearson lore.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.866
Every year, one special person
gets to wear it,

19:26.899 --> 19:28.535
and this year,
it's Daddy's turn.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.237
Let me get you-- oop, yeah.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.273
Let's just get these out
of the way, yeah, all right...

19:36.276 --> 19:38.545
-Seriously, Tobe?
-Hmm?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.880
What are you afraid of?

19:40.913 --> 19:44.451
Just say it. Are you worried
that Jack's gonna get fat?

19:45.618 --> 19:48.321
Um, am I not allowed
to have any opinion

19:48.355 --> 19:49.989
about what we feed
our son at all?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.259
Yeah, you can have a say,
but you're criticizing.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.093
And you always do that.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.094
It's like you're
a one-man tribunal, okay?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.563
I am here with them every day

19:56.596 --> 19:58.898
-doing the hard work.
-(laughs) I did that work

19:58.931 --> 20:00.433
when I was unemployed, Kate.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.769
What do you want me to do?
Just not have any opinions

20:02.802 --> 20:04.771
about our kids because
you're overly sensitive

20:04.804 --> 20:06.439
about everything I say?

20:06.473 --> 20:08.074
Hey, Tobe.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.943
Come on, man, just...
maybe take it easy?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.912
You know, if I want advice
from a 41-year-old man-child

20:12.945 --> 20:15.448
sleeping on my couch,
I'll let you know.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.949
Kate, I support our family.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.287
All right? I-I am not, uh,
some absentee father

20:20.320 --> 20:22.589
-throwing parties
in San Francisco.
-(baby babbles)

20:22.622 --> 20:23.623
You can't treat me
like a bystander

20:23.656 --> 20:24.791
in our children's lives.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.058
And yes, I am worried

20:26.092 --> 20:27.794
that we are overfeeding
Jack a little,

20:27.827 --> 20:30.229
and I think, I think
we would be insane

20:30.263 --> 20:32.732
not to acknowledge
our genetics here.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.475
Toby, take off the hat.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.844
What?

20:45.945 --> 20:48.648
Take off the hat.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.821
(whispers): I swear,
every year with this family.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.760
(clears throat)

21:02.695 --> 21:04.163
Um...

21:06.833 --> 21:11.438
You don't know how many weeks
she worked on tonight's dinner.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.641
I mea-- Studying family recipes.

21:14.674 --> 21:18.945
She really just wanted it
to be perfect for you.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.150
You know, she-she used
to want to be just like me.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.987
Dave used to call her my shadow.

21:33.159 --> 21:38.164
Listen, um, Dave and I,
we're moving to Connecticut.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.200
Dave got a new job, and...

21:42.335 --> 21:44.971
I can barely get her
to visit me here.

21:45.004 --> 21:48.007
Do you really think
she's gonna drive eight hours?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.643
Yeah, she will.

21:50.677 --> 21:54.847
(stammers)
I promise, Janet, we will.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.689
You know, just--
Give me ten minutes.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.461
YOUNG RANDALL:
Smile. Face.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.196
-Uh...
-BETH: Um, oh.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.232
It's-it's my, uh,
sixth favorite thing about you.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.801
My dimples.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.302
REBECCA:
Aww, that was it?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.871
-That's sweet.
-(clapping)

22:18.905 --> 22:20.206
MIGUEL:
Okay, Marguerite.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.741
-All right, here we go.
-Oh...

22:21.774 --> 22:23.976
Um, I wish I could
say it in French.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.479
Uh, what-what is the word
for nourriture? Um...

22:26.513 --> 22:29.148
Um... apples.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.851
-Uh, orange. Um...
-What kind of...

22:31.884 --> 22:33.520
-REBECCA: Eating.
Bell-- uh, stomach ache.
-No, no, no, no.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.921
-MIGUEL: Tummy ache.
-Oh, no.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.990
Um, it is a place
with colorful flowers.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.359
-(buzzes)
-Can't say "flowers."

22:40.393 --> 22:41.327
-REBECCA: Okay.
-MIGUEL: Take us home.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.696
Come on, old guys, we got this.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.131
MATT:
All right, Rebecca,
let's get some points.

22:47.033 --> 22:52.439
Okay, this is kind of similar
to a turtle, but not...

22:52.472 --> 22:54.707
-Uh, a tortoise.
-No, not a tortoise.

22:54.741 --> 22:58.110
Oh, Miguel, you had
two of these growing up,

22:58.144 --> 22:59.779
-named Lucy and Desi.
-Oh, lizards.

22:59.812 --> 23:00.947
-Yes! Okay.
-Lizards.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.682
MIGUEL:
How did you even remember that?

23:02.715 --> 23:03.683
-(laughs): All right.
-REBECCA: Um...

23:03.716 --> 23:06.686
Oh, uh, okay, you and Jack

23:06.719 --> 23:08.788
once went to Froggy's,
you saw "Mean" Joe Greene,

23:08.821 --> 23:10.790
-you got his...
-Autograph.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.625
-Yes.
-Yes.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.794
-(laughter)
-Um...

23:14.827 --> 23:17.363
You used to call me Mary Tyler
Moore because I wore a...

23:17.396 --> 23:19.031
-A beret.
-(laughs): Yes!

23:19.065 --> 23:21.634
REBECCA (laughs):
This is so fun. Um...

23:21.668 --> 23:25.872
Okay, you were chased
by one of these one year

23:25.905 --> 23:28.207
at the Lundy family picnic,
you had to escape

23:28.240 --> 23:29.542
by jumping in a kiddie pool.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.777
(laughs):
The bumblebee.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.479
Yeah, that was not
my finest moment.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.581
REBECCA:
Oh, I thought
it was really cute.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.415
-(Miguel laughs)
-Um...

23:36.449 --> 23:38.117
Oh, your biggest fear in life.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.986
Balding. Going bald.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.321
-(Miguel laughs)
-Okay, okay, okay, okay...

23:42.354 --> 23:46.493
Uh, okay, this is the greatest
Billy Joel song of all time.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.795
Uh, * She's always a woman. *

23:48.828 --> 23:51.097
Okay, but another word
for the last word of that song.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.966
-MIGUEL: Uh, uh, girl?
-Not girl, not girl.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.301
But, um...

23:55.334 --> 23:58.671
Oh, uh, okay.
Um, Susan Dey from L.A. Law.

23:58.705 --> 24:01.073
-You always say
she's one beautiful...
-Female!

24:01.107 --> 24:02.341
Female, yes! I love you, Miguel!

24:02.374 --> 24:05.277
Time's up, time's up,
time's up, guys.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.280
(exhales)

24:09.215 --> 24:12.351
(laughs)

24:12.384 --> 24:13.653
All right.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.464
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.199
(Beth exhales)

24:27.233 --> 24:29.902
Aww. Look at this.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.839
So much love.
(tongue clicks)

24:34.974 --> 24:36.509
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

24:36.543 --> 24:38.845
but I've been sent
to confiscate your phone.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.047
What? "Sent"?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.281
By whom?

24:42.314 --> 24:45.117
Damn near everybody.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.720
-Have I been that annoying?
-Yes.

24:49.055 --> 24:52.024
The girls know
and love your mom.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.926
I know.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.697
I feel disconnected from her.

24:59.732 --> 25:02.134
She used to live
30 minutes away from us.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.237
The girls are used to her
just popping over.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.907
Now she lives
on a whole other coast.

25:09.609 --> 25:13.245
Kev is building her a house.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.147
She's practically raising
all these babies with them.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.917
And I'm happy for them, I am,
I just...

25:19.886 --> 25:21.353
I miss her.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.591
I know.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.228
But I am gonna need
to take the phone.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.463
-Your mom was pretty adamant
about it.
-Okay.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.270
(sighs)

25:38.304 --> 25:40.306
(footsteps approaching)

25:48.815 --> 25:50.049
(Toby exhales)

25:53.986 --> 25:56.723
We just keep having the same
argument over and over again.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.459
I know.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.196
You're upset that I'm not
around more.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.632
I'm sensitive about that.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.134
Pointed jabs, rinse and repeat.

26:12.739 --> 26:13.973
I know.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.210
But in this...
(grunts)

26:18.244 --> 26:20.680
...specific argument,
I want to say...

26:23.950 --> 26:26.252
...we were both fat kids.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.155
And it was hell.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.959
And Jack has our genes.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.264
So if I can help him
to eat healthy

26:38.297 --> 26:43.335
and to avoid any of that pain,
I'm gonna do it.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.815
Do you remember
the song "Kiss Me"?

26:57.383 --> 26:59.986
It played during the
makeover/transformation scene

27:00.019 --> 27:01.620
from She's All That.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.022
Freddie Prinze Jr. is standing

27:03.055 --> 27:05.091
at the bottom of the stairs,
and the formerly

27:05.124 --> 27:07.760
nerdy girl Laney Boggs
walks down the stairs

27:07.794 --> 27:09.862
in this incredible red dress,

27:09.896 --> 27:12.932
and she's so gorgeous
that he's completely floored.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.802
* Kiss me, out of
the bearded barley... *

27:15.835 --> 27:17.804
Do you remember the scene?

27:17.837 --> 27:20.039
I don't think
that the makeover scene

27:20.072 --> 27:22.374
from She's All That is the piece
of cinematic history

27:22.408 --> 27:24.610
-that you think it is.
-Okay.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.845
(laughs softly)

27:28.147 --> 27:32.218
After my dad died and I started
gaining all the weight,

27:32.251 --> 27:36.522
I would stop myself from eating
by singing "Kiss Me."

27:44.263 --> 27:49.168
* Swing, swing,
swing the spinning step... *

27:49.201 --> 27:52.371
I would imagine myself
at Kate 2.0

27:52.404 --> 27:54.206
walking down the stairs

27:54.240 --> 27:57.176
thin and beautiful.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.178
Like I was meant to be.

28:02.548 --> 28:05.918
Until I would eat something bad
or too much of it.

28:05.952 --> 28:10.522
You know, and then, I just saw
Kate 2.0 slipping away.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.691
And the shame would
keep building

28:12.725 --> 28:14.326
and I'd keep binging and...

28:14.360 --> 28:17.663
my entire life has been
a cycle of just...

28:17.696 --> 28:20.099
(exhales)
...dieting and binging.

28:20.132 --> 28:24.203
I mean, food has always had
this intense power over me.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.906
And I don't want it to have
that power over our kids.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.708
I want them
to enjoy Thanksgiving

28:29.742 --> 28:31.944
without having shame about it.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.280
Toby...

28:34.313 --> 28:37.516
I need you to know
that I've put a lot of thought

28:37.549 --> 28:39.718
into what I feed our children.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.088
A lot of thought.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.690
And I...

28:44.723 --> 28:47.326
I just don't know
how you don't know that.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.529
(footsteps approach)

28:50.562 --> 28:52.765
Sorry to interrupt. Um...

28:52.799 --> 28:54.700
Kate, are you ready
for that talk?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.804
Yeah. Yeah.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.939
Okay.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.050
I can't stand her, Jack.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.952
Every single word that comes
out of her mouth,

29:12.985 --> 29:15.221
-every word i-is just...
-I-I-- I know.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.989
I know, she just...

29:18.424 --> 29:20.759
She-she feels like
she's losing you.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.962
And she knows
she's driving you crazy...

29:22.995 --> 29:25.297
(sighs) If someone knows
they're acting crazy

29:25.331 --> 29:28.667
and never stops,
that is crazy, right?

29:28.700 --> 29:32.271
Look, I just, I think
things are heightened right now.

29:32.304 --> 29:36.342
I mean, with the holiday,
the wedding, them moving.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.644
Who's moving?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.916
You're moving to Connecticut?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.751
Yes.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.587
Your father finally got
his dream job.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.189
Two years before retirement.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.524
We're moving right after
the holidays.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.029
Mom.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.532
I'm gonna miss you so much.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.102
My baby girl.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.670
Aww.

30:04.703 --> 30:08.140
Rebecca, your dinner
was very good.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.976
-It was.
-No, no, the turkey was dry.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.544
I cannot believe
you're gonna be so far away.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.680
I need you here
for my wedding, Mom.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.516
Aww. Jack, why did you
tell her like that?

30:17.549 --> 30:20.052
You weren't supposed
to just blurt it out.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.820
REBECCA:
Yeah, my mom told you

30:21.854 --> 30:22.821
-in confidence, Jack.
-Yeah.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.390
What the hell?

30:25.391 --> 30:27.159
(stammers softly)

30:31.998 --> 30:35.501
Seems like I've been focusing
on the wrong guy all day, huh?

30:36.602 --> 30:37.836
(laughs softly)

30:37.870 --> 30:40.106
I'm sorry, what?

30:42.074 --> 30:44.743
I did something terrible.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.345
To Sophie.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.181
You know, I blew it.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.886
And I can literally
hear him sometimes.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.289
I can hear his voice.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.427
You know,
h-his disappointment in me,

31:01.460 --> 31:04.230
in my choices and...

31:04.263 --> 31:06.698
things I should have
had a handle on.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.703
You ever get that feeling?

31:13.805 --> 31:17.576
Uh, I'm not sure I get anything
you're saying right now, Kevin.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.611
You should drink some water.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.413
You were his best friend, man.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.450
So...

31:24.483 --> 31:26.518
if you're even considering
acting on whatever the hell

31:26.552 --> 31:28.955
is going on with my mom...

31:28.988 --> 31:30.622
Just know when you feel
the Earth

31:30.656 --> 31:34.860
rumbling beneath your feet,
it's him.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.828
Turning over in his grave.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.339
(Rebecca sighs)

31:50.142 --> 31:52.945
I'm a little nervous,
so I wrote down some notes.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.981
Um...

32:00.152 --> 32:03.222
There is no easy way
to start this.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.923
Um...

32:06.858 --> 32:11.497
When Dad died, it was a shock.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.833
Right? And we were
all left scrambling,

32:14.866 --> 32:17.469
trying to figure out

32:17.503 --> 32:20.806
our roles and how to move on.

32:20.839 --> 32:22.941
Um...

32:22.975 --> 32:27.579
And the one silver lining
of this awful disease

32:27.613 --> 32:31.150
is that I have the opportunity
to make a plan.

32:31.183 --> 32:35.687
To try and ease
some of the burden, so...

32:35.721 --> 32:39.791
First things first, um,
no matter how this thing goes,

32:39.825 --> 32:43.529
no matter how slow or fast,

32:43.562 --> 32:46.999
if decisions need
to be made for me,

32:47.033 --> 32:50.302
Miguel is the captain
of that ship.

32:50.336 --> 32:54.006
-We have talked through
every sad scenario...
-Mm-hmm.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.309
...and the last thing
he needs to deal with

32:57.343 --> 33:00.879
are disagreements about my care.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.115
So I need to hear you all
agree to that.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.816
We agree.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.817
-Of course.
-Yes.

33:05.851 --> 33:06.952
-REBECCA: Yeah?
-Great.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.620
Thank you.

33:08.654 --> 33:13.192
Um, and Kev, Miguel wasn't
asking about the guesthouse

33:13.225 --> 33:14.660
for fishing buddies.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.830
If we are really doing this,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.233
if this incredibly
generous thing you're doing

33:21.267 --> 33:23.169
for all of us is real, then...

33:24.736 --> 33:26.805
...at some point,

33:26.838 --> 33:28.640
I'm probably gonna need
permanent care,

33:28.674 --> 33:31.009
and they're gonna need
a place to stay.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.986
But hopefully, we are

33:41.019 --> 33:44.056
a very, very long way away
from that. Um...

33:44.090 --> 33:48.327
But in the event that, uh,
Miguel, God forbid,

33:48.360 --> 33:50.996
is not here to make
those decisions for me,

33:51.029 --> 33:53.599
I'm gonna need one of you
to stand in for him.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.434
(inhales)

33:55.467 --> 34:00.339
And I've thought long and hard
about who that should be.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.909
I just, I don't want there
to be any confusion or fights.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.913
There are a lot of reasons
for my decision.

34:07.946 --> 34:13.485
I just, I hope that
the three of you can respect it.

34:18.624 --> 34:21.660
Kate, I want it to be you.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.738
(exhales)

34:32.771 --> 34:35.040
Hmm.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.642
Believe it or not,
that was the easy part

34:36.675 --> 34:39.511
of the family meeting. Um...

34:42.414 --> 34:45.284
My last request is, um,

34:45.317 --> 34:49.955
less a request and
more of a demand, actually.

34:49.988 --> 34:52.891
Um...

34:52.924 --> 34:56.162
This disease is a real bastard.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.497
And it-it's set me on a road

34:58.530 --> 35:01.400
that's gonna have a lot
of ugly twists and turns,

35:01.433 --> 35:03.302
and I'm afraid
it's gonna be a lot...

35:05.271 --> 35:08.240
...harder on all of you

35:08.274 --> 35:09.841
than it will be on me
and I hate knowing that.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.244
I hate it.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.445
(exhales)

35:13.479 --> 35:15.281
But what I don't want,

35:15.314 --> 35:17.283
I don't want every holiday
for the camera

35:17.316 --> 35:20.419
to be focused on me.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.789
So I need you all
to hear my voice right now,

35:23.822 --> 35:27.326
your mother's voice,
with all of her faculties.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.664
You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.101
This thing
that's happening to me

35:36.134 --> 35:40.138
will not be the thing
that holds you back.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.141
So... take the risks.

35:43.175 --> 35:47.879
Make the big moves,
even if they're small moves.

35:47.913 --> 35:51.717
Forge ahead with your lives
in any and every direction

35:51.750 --> 35:53.852
that moves you.

35:53.885 --> 35:58.357
I am your mother, and I'm sick.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.160
And I'm asking you be fearless.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.132
And if that seems like a tall
order, well, guess what? It is.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.235
But...

36:09.268 --> 36:12.304
The only acceptable response

36:12.338 --> 36:14.506
is a resounding "Yes, ma'am."

36:16.508 --> 36:18.844
ALL THREE:
Yes, ma'am.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.085
Okay, I will call you tomorrow
to go over everything.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.221
Dress, food, venues.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.790
-All of it.
-Oh, I can't wait.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.363
(whispers indistinctly)

36:41.467 --> 36:44.303
Oh. There you are.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.940
(exhales)

36:48.974 --> 36:51.743
-Thanks for helping me clean up.
-Oh, ye-- of course.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.679
You know, I'm always,
uh, happy to help.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.647
(laughs softly)

36:58.550 --> 37:00.286
(chuckles)

37:00.319 --> 37:03.555
He thought it was "Piano Man."

37:03.589 --> 37:05.557
Huh?

37:05.591 --> 37:08.794
Billy Joel's, uh, best song?

37:08.827 --> 37:11.229
Yeah, remember, we argued
about it all night at Froggy's?

37:11.263 --> 37:14.065
Uh, Jack was for "Piano Man"

37:14.099 --> 37:16.968
and I was for
"She's Always a Woman."

37:17.002 --> 37:19.204
Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.506
Yeah.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.110
(exhales)

37:25.143 --> 37:28.580
Earlier, um, my jabs at Matt...

37:30.248 --> 37:32.150
...they weren't harmless.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.587
And they weren't accidental.

37:39.358 --> 37:43.028
Not were mine, at her.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.002
(sighs)
These past two years, Miguel,

37:51.036 --> 37:56.675
you have been so good to me,
to us, and...

38:00.111 --> 38:03.649
...I-I just think somewhere
along the way, I just...

38:03.682 --> 38:06.652
I'm moving to Houston.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.956
I got, I got a job offer there
a few months back.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.425
It's-it's... It's near my kids.

38:13.459 --> 38:18.330
And it's why she was making
Houston jokes tonight.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.469
Oh.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.103
I'm sorry.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.006
I-I'm sorry to tell you
like this.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.346
I feel like I've been
staying around,

38:34.380 --> 38:37.983
you know, because I, um...

38:42.488 --> 38:45.691
It's-- It's just,
it's time, Rebecca.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.496
Now that you're back up
on your feet, um...

38:53.499 --> 38:55.501
It's time for me to go.

39:07.413 --> 39:11.082
It's just, I don't, I don't--
I don't know what else to do.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.922
You're my favorite person.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.270
(door closes)

39:32.303 --> 39:34.740
Oh, Captain, my captain.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.576
Uh...

39:37.609 --> 39:39.110
I got the plans here.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.846
You know, I was thinking, um,

39:40.879 --> 39:42.614
maybe we could
go over them together.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.349
Maybe tomorrow,
we could walk the property,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.753
just you and me,
and you tell me what I missed.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.489
I'd like that very much.

39:51.557 --> 39:54.493
-Um...
-Kevin.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.497
Really is a hell of a thing
that you're doing.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.033
Back at you, Cap.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.102
Back at you.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.576
I don't know what to do, guys.
She's still crying.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.277
You can't do anything.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.746
You can't just
fix people, Randall.

40:16.482 --> 40:19.451
This house is too sad.

40:19.485 --> 40:21.119
Hey, where are you going?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.788
I heard the pool closed down.
(clears throat)

40:22.821 --> 40:24.255
The one we went to growing up.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.157
I just want to check it out
before it disappears.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.593
Kev, right now's probably
not the right...

40:27.626 --> 40:29.427
Don't follow me. I'm not 12.

40:31.362 --> 40:32.664
(door closes)

40:35.701 --> 40:37.769
(Rebecca crying)

40:46.545 --> 40:48.446
(exhales)

40:56.221 --> 40:59.157
He's moving to Houston.

41:07.566 --> 41:10.235
I got to ask.
(laughs softly)

41:14.005 --> 41:16.041
Why me?

41:18.977 --> 41:20.746
What?

41:23.014 --> 41:26.117
You are my daughter
and my best friend.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.153
(Rebecca crying)

41:30.088 --> 41:31.823
(softly):
It's okay.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.826
It was always you, Kate.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.014
(whispers indistinctly)

41:58.183 --> 41:59.851
(exhales):
Oh...

42:14.365 --> 42:16.034
(babbles)

42:16.968 --> 42:18.804
I'll tell you one day, baby.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.539
But not yet.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.709
(laughs)
