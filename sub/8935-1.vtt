WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:02.002
I don't need sk

00:02.002 --> 00:03.370
I don't need
sky-diving lessons!

00:03.370 --> 00:05.238
But you can jump
without lessons, Cedric!

00:05.238 --> 00:06.740
He's going to jump!

00:06.740 --> 00:08.475
Now, step
on it before I...

00:08.475 --> 00:11.177
Yikes, a bee! Au! Ouh!

00:11.177 --> 00:14.180
Let go!
Cedric, jump!

00:14.180 --> 00:16.383
Aaaaaaah!
Hang on!

00:16.383 --> 00:17.617
Let go!

00:17.617 --> 00:19.686
Cedriiiick!!

00:21.054 --> 00:21.087
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.359
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.363
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.265
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.733 --> 00:35.635
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.569 --> 00:37.737
Yikes!

00:38.438 --> 00:39.973
Yaaaah...

00:42.609 --> 00:43.877
Yeaaaah!

00:43.877 --> 00:46.946
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.790
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.158 --> 00:59.592
Cyril Sneer!

01:03.129 --> 01:05.298
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:06.132 --> 01:07.834
the Raccoons!!

01:07.834 --> 01:08.935
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:22.515 --> 01:25.085
When Cyril Sneer is
involved in a big deal,

01:25.085 --> 01:27.687
it's big news in the
Evergreen forest.

01:27.687 --> 01:31.691
And big news is what the
Evergreen Standard is all about.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.827
But Ralph and Melissa Raccoon
will tell you,

01:33.827 --> 01:37.063
it's not always easy
digging up the facts.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.366
Come on guys,
you must know something

01:40.366 --> 01:41.534
about all these rumors.

01:41.534 --> 01:44.270
We know Cyril's
involved in some big deal

01:44.270 --> 01:46.706
with Mr. Knox and
the Rotco Corporation.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.542
All we want are a few details.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.244
Pig 1: We can't
tell you a thing.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.012
This is top secret.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.648
Strictly need-to-know basis.

01:55.648 --> 01:59.886
Pig 2: And the boss says, you
don't need to know anything.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.354
Pig 3: As a matter of fact,

02:01.354 --> 02:04.858
we don't even know what
you don't need to know.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.727
I see a career in
politics for these three...

02:07.727 --> 02:09.462
I said,
move it, meatballs!

02:09.462 --> 02:11.631
Mr. Sneer, we'd like
a comment on your latest

02:11.631 --> 02:13.099
business venture with Rotco...

02:13.099 --> 02:16.035
No comment. Now, get
that flash out of my face

02:16.035 --> 02:17.570
and get off my property,

02:17.570 --> 02:20.640
you miserable muck rakers.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.743
Oh boy,

02:23.743 --> 02:26.880
I always enjoy these
little chats with Cyril.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.117
But we're going to find out
what's behind this Rotco deal,

02:31.117 --> 02:32.919
whether he likes it or not.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.388
Don't panic, Knox.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.658
Ha! We've got 48 hours
to wrap up the deal.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.728
I'm on my way over to the
Rotco offices right now.

02:41.728 --> 02:45.565
And I'm bringing the million
bucks to prove I'm sincere.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.033
Hahha. Ciao.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.170
Floor it, you fluff
brains. Time is money.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.604
Pig 1: B..b..but, boss.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.940
This is a dangerous road.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.543
And I'm a
dangerous tycoon.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.511
Now step on it before I...

02:58.511 --> 03:01.014
Pig 2: Yikes. A bee. Yo ho ho.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.616
Yho ho ho ho. Yaaaaahhh.

03:04.651 --> 03:09.222
Uaaaaaaah!

03:15.361 --> 03:17.430
Wow! Doesn't
that look like

03:17.430 --> 03:19.933
the ultimate experience, Cedric?

03:19.933 --> 03:23.803
Yeah. The
ultimate absolute end.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.872
I'm glad you feel
that way, old buddy.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.975
Cause have I got
a surprise for you.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.212
Oh, you're gonna love it!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.914
Now, I know your birthday's
not till next week,

03:34.914 --> 03:36.783
but I couldn't wait.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.786
Here he is Bernie,
your new student!

03:39.786 --> 03:40.987
S-s-s-student?

03:40.987 --> 03:42.155
That's right Cedric,

03:42.155 --> 03:45.258
I emptied the old
piggy bank and signed us up

03:45.258 --> 03:47.493
for skydiving lessons!

03:47.493 --> 03:49.195
Happy birthday.

03:49.195 --> 03:53.666
B..b..but Bert, I
couldn't possibly accept

03:53.666 --> 03:55.935
such an expensive gift.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.004
Of course you can.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.374
I may have to do without peanut
butter sodas for a month,

04:01.374 --> 04:04.110
but my buddy's worth it!

04:04.110 --> 04:06.646
Uh..gee..thanks Bert.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.481
Y-you're a real pal.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.451
Ooooohhh!

04:11.451 --> 04:13.786
Lady Baden-Baden:
There, there, Cyril.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.856
Your angel of mercy
is right here.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.125
Pop! Pop, are
you all right, Pop?

04:19.125 --> 04:22.862
Oooh. I feel like I
just went through a tax audit.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.297
What happened?

04:24.297 --> 04:27.033
You were in a
pretty nasty accident, Pop.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.034
An accident?

04:28.034 --> 04:30.470
Wait a minute...
wasn't there another car?

04:30.470 --> 04:32.105
Ooh.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.540
Whiplash! I tell you, whiplash!

04:34.540 --> 04:38.444
Cedric, ooo, you'll have to
call the Rotco Corporation

04:38.444 --> 04:40.980
and tell them I'll be a
little late for the meeting.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.016
Ooooh, whiplash!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.485
Did anyone get the number
of that other car?

04:45.485 --> 04:47.687
Ingrid Bellamour:
No need to, Mr. Sneer.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.223
It was my car.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.059
Lady Baden-Baden:
Cyril..Cedric..may I present...

04:53.059 --> 04:55.828
All Pigs: Ingrid Bellamour.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.898
Lady Baden-Baden: Yes.
My old theatre chum,

04:58.898 --> 05:01.501
Miss Ingrid Bellamour.

05:01.501 --> 05:04.871
You may recognize her
from the silver screen.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.541
Pleased to meet
you, Miss Bellamour.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.010
Mr. Sneer... Cyril,

05:11.010 --> 05:13.112
Lady Baden-Baden has told me

05:13.112 --> 05:14.414
a lot about you.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.949
Uh, Pop? Your whiplash?

05:16.949 --> 05:19.986
Oh...
It's all cleared up.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.356
We, Sneers, are fast
healers. Heh-heh.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.225
Pig 1: We have seen
all your movies.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.360
Pig 2: Twice!

05:27.360 --> 05:30.463
The Rose and the Rapscallion
with Cliff Stallion.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.433
Oh, and Queen
of the Endless Isle.

05:33.433 --> 05:37.704
Pig 1: You and Lance Lemming
were just fabulous.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.072
Pig 3: Oh yes...

05:39.072 --> 05:43.009
And what about A Tree
Grows in Saskatchewan.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.746
Oh, I cried all the
way through that one.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.582
Why..thank you.
I'm honored, boys.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.651
Please,
forgive the intrusion.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.887
Um, you wouldn't happen
to know where my money is,

05:54.887 --> 05:56.322
would you, boys?

05:56.322 --> 05:59.759
Pig 2: Uh, heh heh, it's uh,
it's all over the place, Sir,

05:59.759 --> 06:02.962
uh uh the accident, uh.
You know? Hi-Hi!

06:02.962 --> 06:06.766
Well, how's about you go
gather it up, then, boys.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.434
Um.. Pop?

06:08.434 --> 06:10.770
Do you still want me to
call about your meeting?

06:10.770 --> 06:12.872
Oh right. The meeting.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.440
Since you
don't have a car,

06:14.440 --> 06:16.042
perhaps I could drive you there.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.378
I do feel partly responsible.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.813
A drive? With you?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.482
I mean..um heh heh,

06:22.482 --> 06:26.486
I can't imagine a more pleasant
prospect, Miss Bellamour.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.289
Lady Baden-Baden: Cedric,
I do believe

06:30.289 --> 06:34.327
your father is... is smitten.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.096
Pop? No way. Not Pop.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.932
At least I don't think so.

06:39.932 --> 06:42.468
Ralph Raccoon of the
Standard here, to see Mr. Rotco?

06:42.468 --> 06:44.237
Don't worry, I'll let myself in.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.740
Uuurk. Ouch.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.243
That guy has no
respect for the press.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.579
Something smells in
the Rotco Corporation.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.848
Well then.. we
just have to get in there

06:55.848 --> 06:57.550
and sniff out the story.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.920
Let me try my feminine wiles.

07:01.654 --> 07:05.091
Oooff. I must be getting rusty.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.326
Not in my books, baby.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.937
I'll meet you
in an hour. Ta-taaa.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.038
Come on.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.707
Maybe that lady can tell us
what's going on in there.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.476
Excuse me?
Ma'am?

07:23.476 --> 07:25.778
We're from the
Evergreen Standard and...

07:26.712 --> 07:29.248
Aren't you Ingrid Bellamour?

07:29.248 --> 07:31.717
That's right.
And you're the press.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.053
You're just the people
I was coming to see.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.189
It's not fair.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.723
Let's get your money back.

07:37.723 --> 07:41.327
I don't really need
skydiving lessons.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.729
You can't jump
without lessons, Cedric.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.998
Come on men.
Let's hit the silk.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.334
Going down!

07:51.370 --> 07:52.572
Yikes!

07:52.572 --> 07:54.140
Wow! Hoo hoo!

07:54.140 --> 07:56.509
Oh, that was some fun,
huh Cedric?

07:56.509 --> 07:59.445
Yeah, it wasn't so bad.

07:59.445 --> 08:02.181
But there's a big difference
between ten feet

08:02.181 --> 08:05.051
and.. ten thousand feet.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.753
Well, only
a couple of zeros.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.388
Nice form, men.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.657
Now get on up here
and do it again.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.026
Pig 2: So, eh,
we've found.. uh...

08:14.026 --> 08:17.029
$7,062

08:17.029 --> 08:18.598
That means we're missing...

08:18.598 --> 08:20.399
Oh, let' see now.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.369
Pig 1: There's lots
more out there, boys.

08:23.369 --> 08:24.871
Wait a minute.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.573
That's master Cedric!

08:27.573 --> 08:31.410
And he's..he's
training for skydiving!

08:31.410 --> 08:34.046
Pig 2: Skydiving?
That's crazy!

08:34.046 --> 08:36.749
Pig 1: The boss will
want to hear about this.

08:36.749 --> 08:40.253
Who-ho-ho! Who-ho-ho! Wah!

08:41.721 --> 08:43.923
Pig 3: Oh! Mom always said

08:43.923 --> 08:46.292
there'd be days like this.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.131
That's a very inspiring
story, Miss Bellamour.

08:52.131 --> 08:56.469
You know, fund raising is
Lady Baden-Baden's cup of tea.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.137
She'll come through for you.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.973
We'll try and have
this story in today's edition.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.441
That should help a bit.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.410
Now that
you have my story,

09:04.410 --> 09:07.747
I wonder if you'd tell me a
little more about Mr. Sneer.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.016
He seems like such a sweet man.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.851
Heh, well there's..,

09:11.851 --> 09:15.955
there's not much
I can really add to that.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.591
Ingrid, there you are!

09:18.591 --> 09:20.459
And right on time.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.463
Haven't you two got
something to do?

09:24.463 --> 09:25.798
Mr. Sneer.

09:25.798 --> 09:30.303
How dare you walk out in
the middle of our meeting!

09:30.303 --> 09:32.905
I had more important
things to do, Knox!

09:33.339 --> 09:36.776
A gentleman never
keeps a lady waiting.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.344
Shall we?

09:38.344 --> 09:40.513
Why, thank you Cyril...

09:40.513 --> 09:42.615
I don't care, Sir,

09:42.615 --> 09:45.351
if you want to throw
away your fortune,

09:45.351 --> 09:48.588
but you're risking mine too!

09:48.588 --> 09:51.657
Fortunes come
and go, old friend.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.925
But the heart...

09:52.925 --> 09:56.095
The heart remains steadfast.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.332
Now if you'll just excuse us?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.100
Cyril, please.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.669
I don't want to interfere
in your business.

10:03.669 --> 10:07.506
From now on,
Ingrid, you are my business.

10:08.007 --> 10:11.677
Boy,
maybe he is smitten.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.113
All right Cedric,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.882
we are as ready
as we'll ever be.

10:16.882 --> 10:20.353
Real men challenging
impossible odds.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.922
Living life to the fullest.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.191
Boy, this is one
birthday present

10:25.191 --> 10:27.059
you'll never forget, huh Cedric?

10:27.059 --> 10:28.527
Yeah.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.830
If I live to remember...

10:35.668 --> 10:39.005
Bert..I.. I can't, Bert.

10:39.005 --> 10:43.876
I-I'm sorry. I just
don't want to do it!

10:43.876 --> 10:46.646
Cedric!...Wait!

10:46.646 --> 10:50.249
I'll bet your hot
shot co-star Lance Lemming

10:50.249 --> 10:51.651
couldn't do this.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.352
I don't know, Cyril.

10:53.352 --> 10:57.023
I didn't' realize you had
so many hidden talents.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.025
Oh, I come from
a long line of

10:59.025 --> 11:01.293
Sneers with hidden talents.

11:01.293 --> 11:04.063
We're a humble lot, you know.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.264
Thank you, Cyril.

11:05.264 --> 11:09.568
I can't remember, when I've
enjoyed myself so much.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.870
I'm glad.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.405
But it's not over yet.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.441
Tinseltown has nothing
on the Evergreen forest.

Cyril, your life
is much more exciting

12:36.489 --> 12:38.524
than any movie hero's life.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.160
Shucks.
I just try to keep busy.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.862
You certainly
know how to put together

12:42.862 --> 12:44.797
an exciting afternoon.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.031
So why should it end?

12:46.031 --> 12:48.534
What about an exciting
evening together.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.035
I'd love to, Cyril,

12:50.035 --> 12:53.105
but..well, I have
an engagement.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.274
Oh..anyone I know?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.343
It's a speaking
engagement, actually.

12:57.343 --> 13:01.280
At Lady Baden-Baden's,
but that's not till later.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.517
Oh! Well,
I'll be there with, er,

13:04.517 --> 13:06.385
bells on. Ha ha.

13:06.385 --> 13:10.122
Er..well how about a
spot of tea at my place

13:10.122 --> 13:11.490
before you go then?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.293
It's not much really...

13:14.293 --> 13:16.529
He! Just a little mansion.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.497
Pig 1: Boss, here's the dough.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.566
We found every last dollar.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.402
Good work, boys.
Put it in the vault.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.337
Pig 2: Good work?!

13:25.337 --> 13:28.073
Pig 3: He's never
said that before.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.376
Pig 1: We've never
done that before.

13:30.376 --> 13:35.147
But boss, there's something you
should know about master Cedric.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.916
What should Pop know?

13:36.916 --> 13:41.353
Pig 1: Heh heh. Your
new hobby? Sky diving?

13:41.353 --> 13:43.722
Well, that's all over. I quit!

13:43.722 --> 13:46.192
...and this
is Percival Sneer,

13:46.192 --> 13:48.360
Knight of the oblong table,

13:48.360 --> 13:51.363
champion of the poor,
and all round nice guy.

13:51.363 --> 13:54.266
Everyone says I'm a
lot like Percival.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.102
Oh, hi, Pop.
Hi, Miss Bellamour.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.337
Cedric, my boy,

13:58.337 --> 14:00.406
what have you been
up to all day?

14:00.406 --> 14:03.375
Taking sky diving
lessons, but I decided to...

14:03.375 --> 14:04.510
Sky diving?!

14:05.177 --> 14:06.412
My son?

14:07.413 --> 14:10.282
Boy, that's great!

14:10.282 --> 14:11.984
That's my son Cedric.

14:11.984 --> 14:16.088
Carrying on the Sneer
tradition of daring deeds.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.456
Good for you, son.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.459
I'm uh, ho, ho, proud of you.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.061
Y-you are?

14:22.061 --> 14:24.396
You must be
very brave, Cedric.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.131
Of course, he is.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.767
He's a Sneer. Right son?

14:28.767 --> 14:29.869
Right, Pop.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.605
Pig 2: Mr. Knox to see you, boss.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.773
He says...
...he says.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.642
Hang on a minute, Knox.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.144
Whatever you do,
don't let Cedric

14:39.144 --> 14:41.780
jump out of a plane. Any plane!

14:41.780 --> 14:44.383
If you're quite
finished, sir?

14:44.383 --> 14:48.754
I'm here to pass on a message
from the Rotco Corporation.

14:48.754 --> 14:52.324
They need your commitment
to the plan immediately!

14:52.324 --> 14:53.859
Certainly, Knox.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.929
A Sneer always comes
through on his commitments.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.998
We'll close the deal tomorrow.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.299
How does that sound?

15:00.299 --> 15:04.303
Uh..well uh, that
sounds just jim dandy.

15:04.303 --> 15:08.274
A pleasure doing
business with you, sir.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.310
The Rotco Corporation?
That's right, Ingrid.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.479
They're setting up right
here in the forest.

15:13.479 --> 15:17.116
You sound like you've heard of
the Rotco Corporation.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.584
Yes,
I have heard of it.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.020
I thought, you were an
honorable man, Cyril.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.456
But anyone willing to deal
with the Rotco Corporation

15:24.456 --> 15:27.493
has no honour at all.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.529
But..but..a minute ago,

15:30.529 --> 15:32.698
everything was peachy.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.167
Was it something I said?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.203
Ingrid Bellamour,

15:38.203 --> 15:41.440
movie star, turned
environmental crusader.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.208
Quite a career change, eh Bert?

15:43.208 --> 15:45.344
Huh? Yeah, yeh.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.212
Did you know, she
single handedly convinced

15:47.212 --> 15:49.481
Jumbo Chemicals to
clean up their act?

15:49.481 --> 15:51.850
(sighs) Good for her.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.886
Are you coming
over to Lady Baden-Baden's

15:53.886 --> 15:56.355
to hear Miss Bellamour's
fundraising speech?

15:56.355 --> 15:58.390
Yeah. Maybe.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.159
Look Bert,

16:00.159 --> 16:02.261
there's no point moping around.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.862
I guess...

16:03.862 --> 16:06.365
But I should have asked Cedric

16:06.365 --> 16:08.734
if he wanted to go skydiving.

16:08.734 --> 16:12.004
But oh no. I just signed him up.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.806
Oh.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.176
I wouldn't be surprised,
if he ever talks to me again.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.444
Come on, Bert.

16:18.444 --> 16:21.347
We've got an appointment
with an airplane.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.048
Yo.. You mean it, Cedric?

16:23.048 --> 16:26.218
I-I mean.. oh, great!

16:26.218 --> 16:28.320
Whatever you say, old buddy!

16:28.320 --> 16:31.323
So much for
another major crisis.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.326
Oh, hi, Miss Bellamour.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.028
Is something wrong?

16:36.028 --> 16:39.131
Yes. Yes,
something's very wrong.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.867
I've got a new front
page story for you.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.736
And I'm sorry to say,

16:43.736 --> 16:46.071
that Cyril Sneer
gets the headline.

16:46.071 --> 16:48.107
Pig 1:

16:48.107 --> 16:49.842
If we lose master Cedric,

16:49.842 --> 16:51.410
it's all your fault!

16:51.410 --> 16:53.846
Pig 3: It's not my fault.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.714
Pig 2: You ran over the rake.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.750
Pig 1: (pants) There.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.420
Hey. Come back here!

17:03.355 --> 17:04.556
Shee!

17:08.394 --> 17:11.697
Pig 2: Wait! Master
Cedric, wait!

17:11.697 --> 17:14.633
Pig 1: Ahh. Oof.

17:14.633 --> 17:15.934
Aaaaaah!

17:15.934 --> 17:17.036
Uh!

17:18.370 --> 17:21.907
Boy, I'm sure glad you
decided to jump, Cedric!

17:21.907 --> 17:24.410
This is going to be fabulous!

17:24.410 --> 17:26.478
Heh heh. Yeah.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.747
What made you
change your mind?

17:28.747 --> 17:32.684
A Sneer's gotta do
what a Sneer's gotta do!

17:32.684 --> 17:34.953
Okay, boys!
We're over the jump zone.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.288
Eight thousand feet.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.757
Keep your eyes on the horizon!

17:38.757 --> 17:40.559
Go for it!

17:44.630 --> 17:46.598
Bert, What's wrong?

17:46.598 --> 17:49.001
It's.. so.. high!

17:49.001 --> 17:51.003
I..I've changed my mind...

17:51.003 --> 17:53.072
I..I..I'm not jumping!

17:53.072 --> 17:55.074
Well, I'm going!

17:57.443 --> 18:00.512
Let go!
Cedric. Jump!

18:00.512 --> 18:03.315
Cedric, speak to me!

18:06.485 --> 18:09.521
The Rotco Corporation
is one of the worst.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.890
All their products are
meant to be thrown away.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.359
And they refuse to
consider recycling.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.630
Do we want a company like that
in this forest? Thank you.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.301
Lady Baden-Baden: After
that inspirational talk,

18:22.301 --> 18:26.171
how could we not contribute
to Ingrid Bellamour's

18:26.171 --> 18:28.841
Save Our World Fund.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.009
Open those wallets now.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.179
And recycle your money!

18:35.481 --> 18:37.449
Special edition
of the Standard.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.619
Ingrid Bellamour reveals
the Evergreen forest

18:40.619 --> 18:44.456
soon to be the new home
of the Rotco Corporation.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.692
Oh!

18:46.692 --> 18:50.329
Lady Baden-Baden:
Cyril Sneer and Mr. Knox?

18:50.329 --> 18:51.930
Knoxieeee!

18:51.930 --> 18:54.233
Lady Baden-Baden: After all
we just heard from Ingrid?

18:54.233 --> 18:56.702
Oh, shame on you!

18:56.702 --> 18:58.303
But, honey pie,

18:58.303 --> 19:03.675
they were just planing
a tiny little factory.

19:10.883 --> 19:11.884
Cyril?

19:14.486 --> 19:17.122
I'm sorry it turned out
like this, Cyril.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.191
Pig 1: Boss, come quick!

19:19.191 --> 19:21.093
Pig 2: It's master Cedric!

19:21.093 --> 19:22.928
He's going to jump!

19:24.263 --> 19:25.731
Pig 3: I can't
understand it, boss.

19:25.731 --> 19:29.034
He told us he didn't
want to jump.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.837
That was before some
idiot talked him into it.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.273
Cedric,
you've got to jump!

19:34.273 --> 19:37.109
We can't land
with you out there!

19:37.109 --> 19:38.877
He's
got to jump soon!

19:38.877 --> 19:41.046
Bad weather's moving in fast.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.384
Cedric!
It's all my fault!

19:50.722 --> 19:52.424
I'm scared, Ingrid.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.493
Ahhh!
Hang on!

19:54.493 --> 19:55.627
Let go!

19:55.627 --> 19:56.795
Ooooooh!

19:56.795 --> 19:58.864
Cedriiiic!

19:58.864 --> 20:02.067
I'm coming for yaaaaahhh!

20:06.738 --> 20:08.407
Cedric!!

20:10.309 --> 20:11.577
Yaaaay!

20:12.544 --> 20:14.947
I've got him!
I've got him!

20:16.148 --> 20:17.149
Ooof.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.617
Hooray!

20:18.617 --> 20:20.819
Yaaaahooooo!

20:21.887 --> 20:25.324
I did it, Pop.
I jumped! Did you see it?

20:25.324 --> 20:26.992
I sure did, son.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.927
But if you don't mind,

20:28.927 --> 20:31.230
I'd rather not see it again.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.398
If you insist, Pop.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.301
Ce-Cedric,
are you all right?

20:36.301 --> 20:38.570
Yeah, I think so.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.907
Wait a minute.
You jumped too, huh Bert?

20:41.907 --> 20:44.076
Aw, it was nothing.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.411
Hah hah. It was..it was...

20:46.411 --> 20:48.280
eight..thousand...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.818
Cyril
and Cedric realized,

20:52.818 --> 20:55.621
that when expectations
are too high,

20:55.621 --> 20:58.257
the fall can be a long one.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.592
But the landing
needn't be too rough,

21:00.592 --> 21:04.363
if someone you care about is
there to catch you.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.199
Well, it's for sure.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.601
Rotco's not moving
into the forest.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.370
Maybe this little setback

21:11.370 --> 21:13.305
will make them
clean up their act.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.408
I hope so, Bert.
I just wish...

21:16.408 --> 21:17.442
Ahem.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.714
I was going to use this
money for the Rotco deal.

21:22.714 --> 21:26.518
But, what I'm trying to say is...

21:26.518 --> 21:28.720
I was wrong, Ingrid.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.557
So.. maybe your
Save Our World Fund

21:32.557 --> 21:34.393
can find a better use for it.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.495
It takes a leading man

21:36.495 --> 21:37.996
to admit he was wrong.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.233
Maybe I'll see
you again sometime.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.069
Oh, I'm fairly
sure you will, Cyril.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.571
Bye, bye for now.

21:46.571 --> 21:47.806
Bye!
Take care.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.876
Darn woman. Telling
me how to run my life.

21:50.876 --> 21:53.979
Terrible isn't it, Pop?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.647
If I ever get like that,

21:55.647 --> 21:57.349
let me know, will you, son?

21:57.349 --> 21:59.685
I'll uh,
jump to it, Pop.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.353
Don't get
smart with me, son.

22:01.353 --> 22:02.888
(laughs) Right, Pop.
