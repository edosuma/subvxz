00:02.400 --> 00:04.391
<i>I was a little nervous today.</i>

00:04.480 --> 00:08.678
<i>Maybe it was because I had no idea</i>
<i>who this guy on the back of my bike was.</i>

00:10.320 --> 00:12.959
- See ya tomorrow!
- Will do.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.831
<i>Or maybe I was nervous</i>
<i>because at 3.00</i>

00:16.920 --> 00:19.514
<i>Dr Cox was gonna name me</i>
<i>the new chief resident.</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:22.717
<i>How do I know? Well,</i>
<i>I'm the only one who applied.</i>

00:22.800 --> 00:25.519
<i>But I'm also the only one</i>
<i>who's focused enough to...</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:27.272
<i>Oh, God!</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:33.112
Let me get this straight. You crash into
their truck, and they drive you to work?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.713
We didn't come straight here.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.749
Come on, Dorian, you gotta want it!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.751
Hold up. They made you
move furniture?

00:41.840 --> 00:43.432
It wasn't all bad.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.954
Bubble wrap! Bubble wrap!

00:51.160 --> 00:54.789
<i>Dr Molly Clock,</i>
<i>the new attending psychiatrist.</i>

00:54.880 --> 00:57.792
<i>Yes, she was hot!</i>
<i>But I wasn't a fan.</i>

00:57.880 --> 01:01.077
<i>She's always calling me Johnny.</i>
<i>Also, she wasn't very nice.</i>

01:01.160 --> 01:03.879
Sit with us. We'll make room,
even if I have to stand.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.110
<i>What a bitch.</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.997
<i>Plus, she's always with Elliot,</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:10.958
<i>and since I dumped her,</i>
<i>we weren't getting along great.</i>

01:11.040 --> 01:13.031
Anybody got any extra
ketchup packets?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.872
Thank you, Elliot.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.599
What are you gonna do now
your residencies are over?

01:17.680 --> 01:19.159
I'm still a resident.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.549
Dr Kelso said
I'm the first medical resident

01:21.640 --> 01:25.189
to repeat his third year
in the entire history of the hospital.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.669
- That's a bad thing.
- I'm staying positive.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.797
I'm starting my endocrinology
and metabolism fellowship.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.714
I'm looking forward to cataloguing
the genetic variations of hirsutism.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.316
Really? Excuse me for taking an interest
in hormonal regulatory research...

01:41.440 --> 01:43.874
I still think you'd make
a good chief resident.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.758
For the five-billionth time,
I'm not interested.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.991
- You'd be a great chief resident.
- You do?

01:50.080 --> 01:51.798
- I just said that.
- I know.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.677
Sorry, ladies. Job's taken.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.876
Dr Cox is naming ass-face here at 3.00.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.030
- It's too late.
- Maybe it's not too late.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.076
- Yeah, it is, Carla.
- Maybe it's not.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.230
- You're right.
- What the hell?

02:02.320 --> 02:05.471
- They're against you.
- I'm invisible, I'm invisible...

02:05.560 --> 02:07.915
- Dr Cox?
- Goddamn it!

02:08.000 --> 02:10.514
Can I still be considered
for the chief residency?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.431
She asked, without a prayer.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.875
Sure. Why not?

02:17.520 --> 02:19.829
<i>Raise it, raise it</i>

02:19.920 --> 02:22.878
<i>And grind it</i>
<i>Grind it, grind it</i>

02:22.960 --> 02:24.279
You OK, buddy?

02:24.360 --> 02:26.590
<i>I just needed to talk to someone.</i>

02:27.760 --> 02:28.875
Tough break, JD.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.112
You've dreamed of being chief resident
since you were a boy in Trotwood, Ohio.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.350
<i>What? How does he know that?</i>

02:35.440 --> 02:37.158
Thank you, Frank.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.951
What do you think, Perry?

03:00.040 --> 03:04.670
Either this kid has a light bulb up
his butt or his colon has a great idea.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.593
- Excuse us, Lyle.
- Come on, newbie.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.309
- Hey, do you have a magazine?
- Not in me... I mean, on me.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.750
That young man's father
is very important.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.035
Don't tell me. He donated a wing.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.759
- He donated a wing, thigh and a breast.
- Sir?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.718
Yes, genius, in this metaphor
the hospital is a chicken.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.628
Please, sir, I totally get that.
<i>How could a hospital be a chicken?</i>

03:26.720 --> 03:28.119
Focus on nothing else.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.956
What a jerk.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.119
When Elliot asked if she could run for
chief resident, that was a goof, right?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.236
Ran all those tests on Mr Landesman.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.754
Top-notch work there, Barbie.
She's good.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.038
She's very, very, very good.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.031
Oh. Sorry. Where were we?

03:46.120 --> 03:49.715
I am a professional, and you are
not gonna get me to compete with Elliot.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.075
Well, JoJo, right now she's winning.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.436
Let me know how to get on top. I'll do
anything. Even if I have to kill!

03:55.520 --> 03:59.195
Start by getting the light bulb
out of this genius's pooper.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.395
Impress me.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.550
Oh, I'll impress you!

04:03.520 --> 04:05.795
Hit the water!

04:08.600 --> 04:12.559
<i>I'll impress him some other way.</i>
Doug! Stay positive.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.192
Awesome!

04:18.120 --> 04:20.111
Perry.
I have a cousin named Perry.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.830
Actually, no, he's not my cousin.
And his name isn't Perry. It's Jeff.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.753
That's funny. I have an uncle
named "Stop bothering me."

04:27.840 --> 04:29.034
Interesting.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.193
Dr Kelso said that since psychiatrists
are the Wal-Mart greeters of medicine,

04:33.280 --> 04:35.475
I need to publish a paper
to earn my keep.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.519
I'm going to do a study about conflict
resolution between hospital personnel,

04:39.600 --> 04:41.716
and I was wondering
if I could observe you.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.358
Look, "doctor,"

04:43.440 --> 04:48.036
us real doctors are here to work,
so there's not a whole lot of conflict.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.477
My day is already bad enough on account
of I gotta tell Mr Roman that he...

04:52.560 --> 04:56.269
Oh, my God. Mr Roman
doesn't need to have surgery.

04:56.360 --> 05:01.115
I never get to give good news.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.238
Subject elongates words when excited.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.038
Mr Roman, great news!

05:07.120 --> 05:10.112
I don't need surgery.
Dr Turk just told me.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.597
You should've seen him. He was so happy
he started dancing in his bed.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.433
It was sort of, like...
From the waist up.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.154
You stole my moment,
and you will pay.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.351
Oh, this is good.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.478
Molly helped me fill out
my chief resident application,

05:33.560 --> 05:35.198
so, gonna give it to Dr Cox.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.032
There you go, working girl.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.556
I told Elliot a million times
that she would be a good chief resident,

05:40.640 --> 05:41.959
but she just ignored me.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.873
- Maybe she's racist.
- Whatever. It's fine.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.032
It's not like all my friends
are gonna go to Molly for advice.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.193
If you want to talk about your husband,
we can go to my office now.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.915
Excuse me.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.516
<i>When Turk told me he pissed</i>
<i>Dr Cox off by stealing his moment,</i>

06:04.600 --> 06:06.477
<i>I decided not to share it with Elliot.</i>

06:06.560 --> 06:10.189
Dr Cox, can you look at
my patient's rash? It's weird.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.479
I'd love to look at your patient's rash,
but also, if time allows,

06:15.560 --> 06:19.109
maybe we could go over some preliminary
ideas for your wedding dress.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.037
I have sketches in my locker.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.590
Barbie! Listen carefully,
because the policy remains unchanged.

06:24.680 --> 06:29.515
Unless someone is dying, and note,
dying, not dead, I'm not interested.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.912
And PS, a real strong showing
for a chief resident candidate.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.150
God almighty.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.356
Don't feel bad. You couldn't
have seen it coming. Awful, though.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.273
Well, I'm off to Pilates.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.158
<i>I didn't feel bad.</i>
<i>A lot of people were playing dirty.</i>

06:49.240 --> 06:52.596
I told him all about the surgery
and he's good to go.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.035
So what do you say
we yank out that gallbladder?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.680
That's the way you tell me
I need major surgery?

06:57.760 --> 06:58.988
You said you told him.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.911
Why would I steal your moment?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.595
Except for maybe because
payback is a bitch.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.158
Have one, baby. You'll feel better.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.596
Turk, I heard your conflict
with Dr Cox escalated.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.478
He's starting to look like
the break-out character,

07:17.560 --> 07:19.391
the one people love to hate.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.790
In my opinion, it is more
effective to address the situation

07:22.880 --> 07:27.954
than it is to become self-destructive
by overindulging a sweet tooth.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.789
She's right.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.791
Eat that cookie or we'll divorce.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.599
- Baby, I'm not hungry now.
- Eat it.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.194
- What?
- It's 3.00.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.510
3.00's when you announce new chief...

07:45.600 --> 07:48.433
Barbie, you're chief resident.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.950
- Very funny.
- So not joking.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.477
Oh, my God.
Now I know how Liza Minnelli felt.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.951
When she won the Oscar, not when
she married that gay pan-faced alien.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.712
Newbie, how you doin'?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.916
<i>Keep it together.</i>
<i>It's "be a man" time.</i>

08:06.000 --> 08:10.516
No, no, I totally understand.
Come on. You did what you had to do.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.592
You went with your gut.
Elliot's a great doctor.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.795
I do have three questions, though.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.678
Why do you hate me when
I show you nothing but love?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.079
Who's gonna tell my mom?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.832
And what am I supposed to do

08:22.920 --> 08:27.869
with 10,000 "John Dorian,
Chief Resident" business cards?

08:27.960 --> 08:31.714
Yeah, Scarlett,
you're chief resident too.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.153
What, now?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.356
With her being
ridiculously book smart

08:36.440 --> 08:39.078
to the point where she has
no interpersonal skills

08:39.159 --> 08:42.197
and you being cuddly
as an un-potty-trained labradoodle

08:42.280 --> 08:46.478
and as useful in medical situations
as an un-potty-trained labradoodle,

08:46.560 --> 08:51.429
together, the two of you make
one barely passable doctor...

08:51.520 --> 08:54.080
...slash labradoodle.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.470
So if we'll both be chief residents,
why didn't you just say that?

08:57.560 --> 09:01.439
What, and miss your hall of fame hissy?
Not on your life. Walk with me.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.268
John Dorian, Chief Resident.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.836
Elliot and I doing this together
is gonna be a little tough.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.673
- We're going through a rough patch.
- I get that.

09:14.760 --> 09:20.153
What you need to do is give each other
tons of space. Here's your office.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.070
Well. Enjoy.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.394
Maybe I wasn't clear.
This patient is important.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.914
Translation:
Don't pass him off to dumb guy.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.319
I take issue with that.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.834
You were gathering
a group of large orderlies

09:38.920 --> 09:41.229
to get the light bulb out
by doing what?

09:41.320 --> 09:44.198
- Shaking him like a beach towel.
- Goodbye.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.592
Last chance, Perry. Fix this kid.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.638
I paged a surgical consult.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.358
Of course you did.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.829
I heard this guy's got
a light bulb up his arse.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.480
Are you the surgical consult?

09:58.560 --> 10:02.758
No. I'm not even working today.
I just want to ask him four questions.

10:02.840 --> 10:08.119
Whazzup?! Dr Tizzurk
is in the hizzouse...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.036
<i>Conflict is everywhere,</i>

10:11.120 --> 10:14.954
<i>whether it's out in the open</i>
<i>or bubbling just under the surface.</i>

10:15.040 --> 10:18.555
By doing this study I realised
some of the most interesting conflicts

10:18.640 --> 10:22.155
are when one of the parties
doesn't realise they're in a fight.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.468
Really?

10:25.640 --> 10:28.552
<i>I guess the only thing to do</i>
<i>when you're in the middle of it</i>

10:28.640 --> 10:30.790
<i>is to hope that nothing makes it worse.</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:34.190
Cleaning time!
Don't worry, I'll go fast.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.228
That one got away.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.356
- It burns!
- Ammonia burns?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.031
Write that down.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.358
I'd be happier if I didn't have to
share the job with such a jerk.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.919
Elliot, I can hear you.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.594
This situation
would be perfect for my study.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.194
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry. Everyone's anonymous.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.271
I'm only using initials. You'll be JD.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.510
Great. Maybe we could
make it permanent.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.955
- Johnny.
- <i>Of course not.</i>

11:03.040 --> 11:06.032
The way I see it, you guys can get
past it and talk like adults,

11:06.120 --> 11:08.395
or you can behave like petty children.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.879
<i>We decided to go petty.</i>

11:09.960 --> 11:13.635
Instead of sharing you, we're gonna
separate you into two resident teams

11:13.720 --> 11:15.950
so that JD and I
never have to see each other.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.635
- I'll take Doug.
- Yes! Suck on that.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.915
Thanks, JD. First pick.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.275
You're the only one
whose name I know.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.999
- I'll take Indian Elvis.
- Yes!

11:27.080 --> 11:29.514
- Pick the hot chick.
- Shut up, Doug!

11:29.600 --> 11:31.192
We'll take the hot chick.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.472
- Name's Amy, actually.
- John Dorian, Chief Resident.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.516
Website's on the back.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.989
I've got a two-hour break
between patients.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.550
Do you want to grab lunch? Or dinner?
I'm not sure what time it is.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.074
<i>Elliot and I weren't</i>
<i>the only ones to go petty.</i>

11:47.160 --> 11:49.993
You know what?
I have a barbecue to go to.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.991
Why don't you meet me there?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.911
Cool.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.674
- Hey, are you Todd?
- Oh, yeah.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.036
- Carla said you're having a barbecue.
- No. But stick around.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.315
I'll see if we can get
something cookin'.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.836
- This is Pat and Frank from 4G.
- Hi. I'm Molly.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.795
And you're naked.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.677
Uh-huh.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.194
Awesome.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.511
Why don't we just reach up there
and tug that bad boy out?

12:18.600 --> 12:21.751
It's not a rabbit in a hat.
If you tug on it, it's going to break,

12:21.840 --> 12:25.150
and if it breaks, he's going to need
surgery, and if you perform it,

12:25.240 --> 12:27.196
then he's going to need a casket.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.671
So why don't you just play quietly
in your area until the crowd arrives?

12:31.760 --> 12:34.194
I thought nobody
wanted to take the case.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.956
At first, but now that it's a hospital
mystery, every jackass in the joint

12:39.040 --> 12:42.237
is going to want to come in here
and give their two cents' worth.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.195
If we could just find
the lamp the bulb came from.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.748
Leon's trained to retrieve things.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.797
That's why my wife and I use candles.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.395
Zeltzer, you are the most
disturbing man I've ever met in my life.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.075
Oh, stop it. Hey, are you
and your wife open-minded?

13:02.160 --> 13:05.789
That's it! I want everybody to get out
who is not an expert on light bulbs.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.635
Go on, get out.
Out, out, out!

13:10.720 --> 13:12.233
What are you still doing here?

13:12.320 --> 13:16.108
What you have there
is an A-21 bulb on an E-26 base,

13:16.200 --> 13:19.556
burning 100 watts,
putting out about 130 volts.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.959
You're helping me.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.508
Not so fast.
You're working with me, tall man.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.919
Actually, no.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.709
If I had the time, maybe,
but I've got a room to clean.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.754
Keep up, people.
We got pre-rounds to do.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.195
Get the lead out, Elvis.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.752
OK, she's gone.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.116
Now, I've heard some rumours
there's been some fraternising

13:43.200 --> 13:44.918
with some of Dr Reid's residents.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.391
I don't want to mention any names,
but, Slobodan, enough of that crap!

13:49.480 --> 13:51.152
Watch your ass.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.516
Now, come on, you nerds.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.717
Carla, Todd has something
he wants to say to you.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.791
I'm sorry if I ever demeaned you.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.916
My feelings
about women were warped

14:02.000 --> 14:05.037
by a very unhealthy
relationship with my mother.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.633
We made out once.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.558
That's good, Todd. Keep going.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.518
Monique, I owe you an apology.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.511
You fixed the Todd?

14:14.600 --> 14:17.319
Without regular therapy,
it'll only last a week.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.472
So, you're mad at me.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.278
Excuse me?

14:22.360 --> 14:25.432
You're not mad at me.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.431
Why did you just close your eyes at me?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.476
I've never been able to wink.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.278
Oh. I'm not mad.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.876
You're stubborn and proud, but you're
nice, so eventually you'll tell me.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.359
No, I won't.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.271
Let go of that anger.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.036
Not my office.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.634
- How's it going in here?
- Go away!

14:48.720 --> 14:51.154
You kind of harmonised on that.
That was cool.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.629
It's not about
the argument anymore.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.632
It's a competition about
who can be stubborn the longest.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.395
The real winner's gonna be
who has the guts to apologise first.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.279
I got something to say!

15:04.360 --> 15:06.510
Sorry about the gallbladder thing.
I win!

15:06.600 --> 15:07.589
Dammit!

15:07.680 --> 15:10.717
You surgeons ride in on your
white horse and save the day.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.758
The best news I ever get to
give everybody, anybody, ever,

15:13.840 --> 15:17.594
is, "By the way, ma'am, were you aware
that that breathing tube in your neck

15:17.680 --> 15:19.352
also comes in day-glo pink?"

15:19.440 --> 15:23.194
Come on, look, bottom line,
I really needed a win.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.795
I did, and I finally got one, and, you,
you stole it, man.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.598
I needed one too.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.835
Where's my win? Think anybody
thanks me for cleaning bathrooms?

15:33.920 --> 15:35.592
The bathrooms are filthy.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.069
No one was thanking me,
so I quit cleaning them.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.312
Holy cow. You realise if we could get
a tight clamp around the bulb...

15:42.400 --> 15:45.710
No, no, you'll break the thing.
Here's the thing about bulbs.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.679
They're structurally weak at the
narrow end. The round end is strong.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.435
- If we can get behind the bulb...
- We go down the mouth.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.555
Your turn's over.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.189
All we need to do is thread
an angioplasty balloon past the bulb...

15:58.280 --> 15:59.395
Inflate it...

15:59.480 --> 16:02.313
- And then pull.
- Pull it.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.231
I concur.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.475
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.031
No.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.756
Doug wanted me to give this patient
500,000 milligrams of morphine.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.479
I thought I'd check with you
before I killed a man.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.357
Unbelievable, Doug.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.516
I just came to check on my patients.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.795
Do what you want.
Just don't come to my area.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.632
You couldn't pay me to come.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.950
- I wouldn't pay you.
- You don't have enough.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.759
I have a rich uncle
who'd do anything for me,

16:35.840 --> 16:38.957
but I'd never call in that favour
to pay you to come to my area.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.439
<i>Got her.</i>

16:40.520 --> 16:43.910
I hate to interrupt, but you need
to take a look at this man.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.389
- Elliot, he's in V-tach.
- Get the crash cart.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.549
One milligram epi.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.392
<i>The best thing about this place</i>

16:49.480 --> 16:52.790
<i>is that when someone's in trouble,</i>
<i>all the pettiness melts away.</i>

16:54.640 --> 16:56.278
What are you doing?

16:56.360 --> 17:00.148
Well, I'm tired of trying to find
my office, so I just set up shop here.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.994
Oh! OK, that's not weird.
Look, I want to apologise for my wife.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.672
She'd never admit it to you,

17:06.760 --> 17:10.069
but she likes to be the person
who tells everybody what to do.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.868
Apparently she can't get enough of it
at home. Right? Right?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.109
Wrong. Look...

17:16.200 --> 17:20.590
If every once in a while you could
let her be the one to give the advice,

17:20.680 --> 17:22.557
you guys might end up being friends.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.073
I can do that...

17:25.760 --> 17:28.035
...and tell Carla that you did well.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.519
You truly underestimate
how proud my wife is.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.512
If she knew I was here, she'd kill me.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.556
All right.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.278
What happened to the part
about how much I help people?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.999
- She said I did well.
- Turtlehead.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.719
You're gonna want to get
a piece of this. Come on.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.439
- Where'd you get the coat?
- I earned it.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.795
Let's get our moment.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.196
- Thanks for all the hard work, Bob.
- Glad to do it.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.319
Oh, and, Bart, I think Lyle might be
ready for that rough-sex-play talk

18:02.400 --> 18:05.039
you had with your other boys.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.678
Too late.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.113
Can you imagine us trying
to do that three years ago?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.316
I know.
Remember our first code?

18:14.400 --> 18:17.039
Well, I remember hiding
in a supply closet.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.712
That's the one.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.711
<i>Ultimately, conflict is resolved</i>

18:20.800 --> 18:23.872
<i>by remembering why you were</i>
<i>friends in the first place.</i>

18:23.960 --> 18:26.793
Don't hang up, Lester.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.915
Talk to her.
You know her better.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.309
<i>Or by swallowing your pride.</i>

18:34.400 --> 18:36.038
I know what you're doing.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.072
But I'm OK with it.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.436
- He's coming.
- Get your arse out here.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.432
<i>Or by uniting against the</i>
<i>moment-stealing common enemy</i>

18:50.520 --> 18:55.435
<i>who took credit for your ingenious</i>
<i>method of debulbing a patient's keister.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:10.548
Good Lord!

19:11.400 --> 19:14.358
<i>In the end, though,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter how you get there.</i>

19:14.440 --> 19:16.192
<i>As long as you're friends again.</i>

19:16.280 --> 19:21.308
I miss this.
Just, like, hanging out, you know?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.311
Me too.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.356
We should go get coffee.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.998
We're having coffee.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.517
No, no, I mean, like, outside coffee.
Real world coffee.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.229
The point is we should hang out
outside the hospital sometime.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.914
JD, I still need time.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.152
That's gonna be hard for you because
you like to fix everything right away.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.549
You just do the best you can, OK?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.588
- Is it fixed now?
- Nope.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.035
<i>Shoot!</i>
