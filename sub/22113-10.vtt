00:02.294 --> 00:04.229
- Jasper.
- MELISSA: There is a little boy out there

00:04.254 --> 00:06.087
who's confused and freaked out.

00:06.122 --> 00:07.388
Have you ever been painted?

00:07.424 --> 00:09.123
<i>We're going back to
my place after dinner,</i>

00:09.159 --> 00:10.291
<i>and I'm gonna paint you.</i>

00:10.316 --> 00:12.382
- You're a serial killer.
- I swear I've changed.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.162
- (GRUNTING)
- You got to believe me.

00:14.197 --> 00:15.230
I don't kill anymore.

00:15.298 --> 00:17.332
Jasper?

Hi.

(ERICA SIGHS)

00:22.172 --> 00:25.240
Okay, let's call it a night
and hit it again tomorrow.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.474
Hey, gals.

00:26.509 --> 00:29.344
- Any luck finding Jasper?
- No sign.

00:29.379 --> 00:32.280
Then you'll be happy to know
that we <i> did</i> have some luck.

00:33.350 --> 00:35.216
Here, come with us.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.285
Shh. Easy.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.420
Easy. We don't want to scare him off.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.823
Ladies and gentlewomen,

00:41.848 --> 00:45.310
feast your eyes on... this.

- (ALL SCREAMING)

00:54.879 --> 00:56.078
(GASPS)

00:56.103 --> 00:57.272
I got him.

00:57.973 --> 01:00.073
What the hell?

01:00.189 --> 01:01.276
Hi, I'm Karl.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.343
(SCREAMING)

01:03.392 --> 01:05.179
Blanks. (LAUGHS)

01:05.215 --> 01:07.148
So, yeah, this is Karl.

01:07.183 --> 01:08.416
Karl, this is the group.

01:08.451 --> 01:10.418
Sorry. It wasn't my idea.

01:10.453 --> 01:12.353
Found him on our search for Jasper,

01:12.422 --> 01:14.389
and that little rascal,
Todd, thought this would be

01:14.424 --> 01:16.124
a fun way to introduce him.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.425
- (CAROL GASPS)
- I couldn't talk him out of it.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.067
Ugh, so Jasper is...

01:19.092 --> 01:21.981
- Still out in the wild? Yeah.
- Idiot.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.784
Don't call Karl an
idiot. He is our guest.

01:24.809 --> 01:27.050
Now, come on. Don't be shy.

01:27.075 --> 01:29.598
Karl doesn't bite. Do you, Karl?

01:29.731 --> 01:31.147
Nope.

01:31.619 --> 01:33.386
No.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.019
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:37.055 --> 01:38.154
Okay, okay. I got another one.

01:38.189 --> 01:39.867
What's the worst thing

01:39.892 --> 01:42.358
a prison guard could find at a wedding?

01:43.148 --> 01:46.996
- An open bar.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

01:47.435 --> 01:49.520
Very fun.

01:49.545 --> 01:50.496
So, Karl,

01:50.521 --> 01:53.035
I'm still trying to figure out
how you got trapped in there.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.971
I mean, don't guards have all the keys?

01:55.006 --> 01:56.205
So many keys.

01:56.451 --> 01:58.525
Like, name a number of keys,

01:58.550 --> 01:59.915
and it would be more than that.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.077
But the main door locks,

02:01.112 --> 02:02.211
they were code-based,

02:02.247 --> 02:04.313
and I would always forget the code.

02:04.349 --> 02:08.050
So much so that they called
me The Code Forgetter.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.252
- (LAUGHS): The Code Forgetter.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

02:09.287 --> 02:11.087
Ugh. And I had to sit there and take it,

02:11.156 --> 02:13.156
- 'cause it's so true.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

02:13.224 --> 02:15.124
Anyway, I needed a change,

02:15.160 --> 02:17.126
so I came down to Mexico.

02:17.162 --> 02:19.523
I took up painting, flamenco dancing.

02:19.548 --> 02:21.030
I mean, the whole <i> nueve.</i>

02:21.065 --> 02:23.099
That's, uh, Spanish for nine.

02:23.134 --> 02:25.034
(STAMMERING): Spanish
for nine. Yeah, knew it.

02:25.077 --> 02:26.713
<i>Ocho</i> is eight.

02:26.738 --> 02:28.638
Yeah, life was perfect...

02:29.040 --> 02:31.752
and then the virus struck.

02:32.197 --> 02:35.011
It took my wife and her son...

02:35.079 --> 02:36.979
and his kids and his grandkids.

02:37.015 --> 02:39.015
Towards the end, it was just me

02:39.050 --> 02:42.118
and this one other prisoner.

02:42.187 --> 02:44.020
He was a serial killer.

02:44.055 --> 02:45.866
(ALL GASP)

02:45.891 --> 02:48.024
Killed a lot of people.

02:48.193 --> 02:50.259
And get this:

02:50.535 --> 02:52.268
he would eat them.

02:52.293 --> 02:53.346
- TANDY: What?
- ERICA: Gross.

02:53.371 --> 02:54.197
No.

02:54.232 --> 02:56.032
I mean, who would do that?

02:56.067 --> 02:58.870
That's sick, in my opinion,

02:58.895 --> 03:01.971
but, after some time,
we formed a friendship.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.542
I mean, talk about an odd couple:

03:04.567 --> 03:06.108
a guy who eats people,

03:06.144 --> 03:08.942
and a guy who keeps
people-eaters locked up.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.800
I, of course, being the latter.

03:10.825 --> 03:13.049
I feel like it's important
for me to get in there, again,

03:13.117 --> 03:15.351
how strongly I'm against
the use of people as food.

03:15.386 --> 03:17.119
Yeah, you mentioned that already.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.955
KARL: I was just emphasizing my point.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.224
They used to call me
The Point Emphasizer.

03:21.259 --> 03:23.226
I thought they called
you The Code Forgetter.

03:23.261 --> 03:26.062
- Yeah, but also The Point Emphasizer.
- GAIL: Well, man,

03:26.097 --> 03:27.997
you must be some kind of saint,

03:28.032 --> 03:29.265
'cause I could never be friends

03:29.300 --> 03:32.235
with a psycho killer
qu'est-ce que c'est like that.

03:32.270 --> 03:34.103
I guess I am kind of forgiving.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.906
That's why they called
me The Everyone Forgiver.

03:36.941 --> 03:39.141
- You sure had a lot of nicknames.
- KARL: Yeah.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.277
They used to call me
The Nickname Accumulator.

03:41.782 --> 03:43.682
Anyway, look.

03:43.707 --> 03:45.147
I'm gonna go hit the hay.

03:49.683 --> 03:51.921
I honestly never thought
I'd get this chance again,

03:52.550 --> 03:54.851
so thank you.

03:54.876 --> 03:56.999

- CAROL: Good night.

03:57.024 --> 03:59.265

03:59.290 --> 04:01.470
What a neat guy.

04:01.495 --> 04:03.132
Yep. Handsome.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.700
Ah, wow.

04:08.725 --> 04:11.173
- Something smells delicious.
- GAIL: Oh.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.975
Well, you must be
smelling something else,

04:13.011 --> 04:15.077
'cause it smells like hell in here.

04:15.113 --> 04:18.036
I-I just burned my hair on
that fricking curling iron.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.065
Burned my finger, too.

04:21.543 --> 04:23.510
Oh.

04:23.535 --> 04:25.322
That's what the smell was?

04:25.347 --> 04:27.627
Yuck. That is awful.

04:27.652 --> 04:30.960
Pee-yew. I mean, who could
possibly like a smell like that?

04:31.381 --> 04:33.481
Disgusting smell.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.505
Ah.

04:38.036 --> 04:39.460
I'm really glad you're here.

04:39.485 --> 04:40.991
Erica's birthday's coming up,

04:41.016 --> 04:43.072
and I wanted to get her something nice,

04:43.141 --> 04:45.637
and you mentioned
that you used to paint.

04:45.662 --> 04:47.086
I was wondering

04:47.111 --> 04:49.145
if you'd consider doing a portrait of me

04:49.180 --> 04:50.279
that I could give her?

04:50.315 --> 04:52.114
I don't paint anymore.

04:52.150 --> 04:55.284
Just a lot of bad
emotional connections to it,

04:55.309 --> 04:59.088
so it's a real...
talk-to-the-hand for me.

04:59.123 --> 05:02.472
Sorry. Sad face.

05:02.497 --> 05:03.596
Oh, yeah. That's cool.

05:03.621 --> 05:05.928
I'll just get her a
candle or Lamborghini

05:05.963 --> 05:07.931
- or something.
- You know, for a burn,

05:07.956 --> 05:10.603
you don't need a Band-Aid.
You just have to apply ice.

05:10.628 --> 05:13.936

05:13.971 --> 05:16.939

05:19.219 --> 05:22.278
Is what I heard from my uncle,

05:22.751 --> 05:24.180
because he...

05:24.215 --> 05:27.049
worked at a burn...

05:28.053 --> 05:29.151
firm.

05:30.107 --> 05:31.739
A burn firm?

05:31.764 --> 05:33.222
A firm for burns.

05:33.732 --> 05:36.590
Anyway, ice is best.

05:36.615 --> 05:40.996
Okay. Well, I don't need this, then.

- What are you talking about, hon?
- Why?

08:06.666 --> 08:09.153
Well, the last thing he needs
is us breathing down his neck.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.188
And that's what drove him
away in the first place.

08:11.223 --> 08:13.190
So, what, we just leave him out there?

08:13.225 --> 08:15.326
He was doing fine on his
own before we came along.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.361

find him? Would we ground him

08:17.396 --> 08:18.362
for running away?

08:18.397 --> 08:20.064
Uh, to start.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.298
That worked well last time.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.466
And then what?

08:22.501 --> 08:24.268
Well, we'll tell him
how much we love him.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.370
And how-how much it
scares us that he ran off,

08:26.405 --> 08:29.173
and that it would just kill us
if something happened to him.

have another heart attack?

any chance of him coming back,

- (MOCKING TANDY) Yeah.

10:15.821 --> 10:18.648
So, uh, remind me.

10:19.451 --> 10:21.349
What kind of "penis" are you?

10:21.374 --> 10:22.473
What?

10:22.498 --> 10:24.238
(OVERPRONOUNCING): Pianist.

10:24.639 --> 10:28.778
What kind of "penis" are you?

10:29.449 --> 10:31.212
I'm semiprofessional.

10:32.269 --> 10:33.963
If you say so.

10:33.988 --> 10:34.982
(CHUCKLES)

10:35.018 --> 10:38.219
Hey, have at it.

10:44.329 --> 10:46.900
You're out of here, trash!

10:50.977 --> 10:52.282
Excuse me.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.773
(CAROL LAUGHS)

11:14.798 --> 11:17.497
Okay, we have to talk about Karl.

11:17.522 --> 11:19.327
Something is up with this gal.

11:19.362 --> 11:22.196
I just caught him rooting
around in Gail and Erica's trash.

11:22.231 --> 11:25.151
He said he was taking it
out, but it was so weird.

11:25.176 --> 11:28.311
I felt compelled to write
down all the details.

11:30.114 --> 11:33.473
_

11:33.754 --> 11:35.447
I mean, who in their right mind

11:35.472 --> 11:37.178
digs through someone's stuff like that?

11:37.213 --> 11:39.768
Uh, you sure do. Just last week

11:39.793 --> 11:42.249
I caught you digging through
Erica's skivvy drawer.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.848
Uh, th-that was, uh, research

11:44.873 --> 11:46.954
for a, uh, birthday, uh, gift.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.709
Yeah. Uh, and thanks
for ruining the surprise.

11:49.734 --> 11:50.833
Spoiler, Erica.

11:50.858 --> 11:52.226
You got some nice
panties coming your way.

11:52.261 --> 11:54.575
- Ugh.
- Okay, look, let's consider

11:54.600 --> 11:55.896
all the evidence thus far.

11:56.213 --> 11:58.213
Chick has, like, ten nicknames.

11:58.238 --> 12:00.010
Chick said he was trapped in prison

12:00.035 --> 12:02.556
for six years, even
though it was only four.

12:02.581 --> 12:05.463
Chick <i> claims</i> to be
a semiprofessional pianist

12:05.488 --> 12:08.838
but sounds more like Liberace
taking a dump on a chalkboard.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.578
And, in case you forgot,

12:10.603 --> 12:12.242
referring you back to this.

12:12.267 --> 12:13.313
ERICA: Sounds like he's just

12:13.338 --> 12:14.978
being a good housemate to me.

12:15.003 --> 12:16.217
Erica, my instincts tell me

12:16.285 --> 12:18.852
you're wrong as a dong all day long,

12:18.877 --> 12:20.021
and it's daylight savings.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.923
Well, my instincts tell me that
if <i> you</i> don't like him,

12:22.959 --> 12:25.126
that probably ensures
he's a pretty good guy.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.841
And what's that supposed to mean?

12:26.866 --> 12:29.130
It means you're a horrible
judge of character.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.171
Oh, uh, name one character misjudgment.

12:32.507 --> 12:34.607
Pat. Pamela.

12:34.632 --> 12:36.103
Lewis. Phil.

12:36.139 --> 12:38.172
That's four. I said name one.

12:38.207 --> 12:40.174
Tandy, you tried to kill
Todd when you first met him.

12:40.209 --> 12:43.491
Okay, in fairness... and I think
that Todd would admit this...

12:43.516 --> 12:45.151
He was a real dick in the beginning.

12:45.176 --> 12:46.596
CAROL: I mean, I hate to say it,

12:46.621 --> 12:48.215
Tandy, but if I remember correctly,

12:48.284 --> 12:52.603
you weren't too crazy
about me when we first met.

12:52.628 --> 12:53.830
How about this?

12:53.855 --> 12:55.499
Maybe just this once

12:55.524 --> 12:56.929
take that hunch to lunch

12:56.954 --> 12:58.754
and give Karl a chunce.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.574
Maybe you're right.

13:05.266 --> 13:06.501
Mmm.

13:06.526 --> 13:07.725
Hey, bud. What you slurping?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.537
Oh, uh... uh, nothing.

13:09.562 --> 13:11.138
Just tea. Nothing more. Nothing less.

13:11.174 --> 13:13.174
You certainly seem to be
enjoying it. (CHUCKLES)

13:13.209 --> 13:14.975
Oh, is that a crime, now?

13:15.175 --> 13:17.638
Did they outlaw the enjoyment of tea?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.883
Maybe I missed that being locked in jail

13:19.908 --> 13:22.509
for four years that felt like six.

13:22.916 --> 13:25.019
I think we started
off on the wrong foot.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.118
Hey, I-I just had twins,

13:27.143 --> 13:29.234
and my hormones are raging,

13:29.259 --> 13:32.468
and my fatherhood instincts
are super engorged.

13:32.493 --> 13:34.061
But that's in the past.

13:34.086 --> 13:35.062
Yeah, and I just want to jump

13:35.098 --> 13:38.165
into this relationship
now and just go hog wild.

13:38.201 --> 13:41.102
Well, frankly, I need a little more time

13:41.170 --> 13:44.238
before I'm ready to let my guard down.

13:44.273 --> 13:45.873
Well, whenever you're ready,

13:45.908 --> 13:48.079
you just let me know. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

13:48.104 --> 13:49.771
Enjoy that tizzy.

13:49.796 --> 13:50.995
Tea.

14:06.129 --> 14:08.162
(SLURPS)

14:08.231 --> 14:11.065
(GASPS) Mmm.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.272
Band-Aid tea...

14:18.705 --> 14:22.607
Looks like somebody
just blew their chunce.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.833
- KARL: You're doing that all wrong.
- (GASPS)

14:29.868 --> 14:33.102
(LAUGHING): Oh, my God. You scared me.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.218
I'm doing what all wrong?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.423
Here,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.259
give me that old cube.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.628
Now, get a nice big new cube.

14:40.696 --> 14:43.397
You want to cover the whole area.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.399
(MOANS)

14:50.987 --> 14:52.854
What's wrong?

14:52.879 --> 14:54.800
I'm ready to paint again...

14:54.825 --> 14:57.311
- if that offer still stands.
- Oh.

14:57.336 --> 14:59.313
Okay, yeah. Let's do it.

14:59.877 --> 15:01.939
- (QUIETLY): Yes.
- Clothes on or off?

15:01.964 --> 15:03.898
Probably keep mine on, but, um,

15:03.923 --> 15:05.586
I'm gonna go set up my painting area.

15:05.621 --> 15:08.289
- Mm-hmm.
- I like to do it in a private space,

15:08.324 --> 15:09.984
free from distractions.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.526
This way we can really
sink our teeth into it.

15:12.561 --> 15:14.078
That's just an expression.

15:14.103 --> 15:15.496
I'm dying to get started.

15:15.531 --> 15:17.398
Famous last words, am I right?

15:18.750 --> 15:20.544
How-How so?

15:21.445 --> 15:23.504
I'm gonna go set up the space.

15:24.025 --> 15:25.959
(GAIL LAUGHS SOFTLY)

15:48.721 --> 15:51.265
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.501
Look, I know you were skeptical
about my theories on Karl,

15:54.570 --> 15:56.570
so I just wanted to apologize.

15:56.605 --> 15:59.373
And, as a token, I made you a nice meal.

15:59.408 --> 16:01.442
Oh, bud.

16:01.477 --> 16:03.510
Bon appétit.

16:03.850 --> 16:05.850
Are-are tho... are those Band-Aids?

16:05.875 --> 16:07.953
Yeah. Yeah, so, uh, dig in.

16:07.978 --> 16:11.038
I got you some salt, pepper,
mustard, ketchup, hot sauce.

16:11.063 --> 16:13.454
Uh, h-heads up, the
hot sauce might dilute

16:13.489 --> 16:15.255
the taste of the congealing blood.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.590
Tandy, I'm not gonna eat this.

16:16.659 --> 16:18.559
(SCOFFS) Good, more for me.

16:18.594 --> 16:20.371
Thank you. God,

16:20.396 --> 16:23.221
I cut myself earlier, and, ugh,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.933
it just would not stop,
so I have a ton of these.

16:25.968 --> 16:30.004
And, good for me, I
frigging love used Band-Aids.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.532
- I'm gonna go mustard.
- TODD: Don't... don't do that.

16:32.557 --> 16:35.211
- Tand... Oh, my goodness.
- Mmm.

16:35.685 --> 16:37.793
- Please, don't.
- That's O-positive.

16:37.818 --> 16:39.777
That's disgusting.

16:39.802 --> 16:42.082
(SLURPS) Mmm.

16:42.107 --> 16:44.996
So, uh, if you don't mind me asking, uh,

16:45.021 --> 16:46.472
why don't you like eating Band-Aids?

16:46.497 --> 16:49.123
Because it's disgusting and weird.

16:49.192 --> 16:51.358
Eating Band-Aids is
disgusting and weird?

16:51.394 --> 16:52.899
Yeah, bud.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.329
Huh, well, now I'm confused,

16:55.364 --> 16:57.331
because I just saw the very normal

16:57.400 --> 16:59.967
and fully vouched-for Karl chewing on

17:00.002 --> 17:01.302
a used Band-Aid a few hours ago.

17:01.337 --> 17:02.937
But that's okay, right?

17:02.972 --> 17:05.039
Karl was chewing on a Band-Aid?

17:05.074 --> 17:07.374
Sure was, and I would
normally think that's crazy,

17:07.443 --> 17:09.977
but my instincts are all out of whack,

17:10.012 --> 17:11.244
so I just shrugged my shoulders

17:11.314 --> 17:14.181
and did nothing, like y'all asked.

17:14.217 --> 17:16.336
Are you serious about this?

17:16.914 --> 17:18.327
Yahoo serious.

17:18.352 --> 17:19.920
Tandy, what do we do?

17:19.955 --> 17:21.680
Something.

17:25.428 --> 17:28.295
Knock, knock. You ready?

17:28.871 --> 17:30.763
I've never been more ready.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.941
It's going great so far.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.743
You're a natural.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.597
I'm getting some real...

17:47.914 --> 17:51.334
Whistler's Mother
vibes from you. Uh-huh.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.603
Well, I would have
preferred Stifler's Mother,

17:53.639 --> 17:55.539
but I'll take it.

17:56.724 --> 18:00.122
You didn't tell anyone you
were doing this, did you?

18:00.147 --> 18:03.346
Of course not. Those
goobers can't keep a secret.

18:03.390 --> 18:07.038
I want this to be a surprise for Erica.

18:07.063 --> 18:09.178
I love surprises.
